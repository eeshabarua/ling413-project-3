62,CANTO I,
63,CANTO I,
64,CANTO I,"His glory, by whose might all things are mov’d,"
65,CANTO I,"Pierces the universe, and in one part"
66,CANTO I,"Sheds more resplendence, elsewhere less. In heav’n,"
67,CANTO I,"That largeliest of his light partakes, was I,"
68,CANTO I,"Witness of things, which to relate again"
69,CANTO I,Surpasseth power of him who comes from thence;
70,CANTO I,"For that, so near approaching its desire"
71,CANTO I,"Our intellect is to such depth absorb’d,"
72,CANTO I,"That memory cannot follow. Nathless all,"
73,CANTO I,That in my thoughts I of that sacred realm
74,CANTO I,"Could store, shall now be matter of my song."
75,CANTO I,
76,CANTO I,"Benign Apollo! this last labour aid,"
77,CANTO I,"And make me such a vessel of thy worth,"
78,CANTO I,As thy own laurel claims of me belov’d.
79,CANTO I,Thus far hath one of steep Parnassus’ brows
80,CANTO I,Suffic’d me; henceforth there is need of both
81,CANTO I,For my remaining enterprise Do thou
82,CANTO I,"Enter into my bosom, and there breathe"
83,CANTO I,"So, as when Marsyas by thy hand was dragg’d"
84,CANTO I,Forth from his limbs unsheath’d. O power divine!
85,CANTO I,"If thou to me of shine impart so much,"
86,CANTO I,That of that happy realm the shadow’d form
87,CANTO I,"Trac’d in my thoughts I may set forth to view,"
88,CANTO I,Thou shalt behold me of thy favour’d tree
89,CANTO I,"Come to the foot, and crown myself with leaves;"
90,CANTO I,"For to that honour thou, and my high theme"
91,CANTO I,"Will fit me. If but seldom, mighty Sire!"
92,CANTO I,To grace his triumph gathers thence a wreath
93,CANTO I,Caesar or bard (more shame for human wills
94,CANTO I,Deprav’d) joy to the Delphic god must spring
95,CANTO I,"From the Pierian foliage, when one breast"
96,CANTO I,Is with such thirst inspir’d. From a small spark
97,CANTO I,Great flame hath risen: after me perchance
98,CANTO I,"Others with better voice may pray, and gain"
99,CANTO I,From the Cirrhaean city answer kind.
100,CANTO I,
101,CANTO I,"Through diver passages, the world’s bright lamp"
102,CANTO I,"Rises to mortals, but through that which joins"
103,CANTO I,"Four circles with the threefold cross, in best"
104,CANTO I,"Course, and in happiest constellation set"
105,CANTO I,"He comes, and to the worldly wax best gives"
106,CANTO I,"Its temper and impression. Morning there,"
107,CANTO I,Here eve was by almost such passage made;
108,CANTO I,"And whiteness had o’erspread that hemisphere,"
109,CANTO I,Blackness the other part; when to the left
110,CANTO I,"I saw Beatrice turn’d, and on the sun"
111,CANTO I,"Gazing, as never eagle fix’d his ken."
112,CANTO I,As from the first a second beam is wont
113,CANTO I,"To issue, and reflected upwards rise,"
114,CANTO I,"E’en as a pilgrim bent on his return,"
115,CANTO I,"So of her act, that through the eyesight pass’d"
116,CANTO I,"Into my fancy, mine was form’d; and straight,"
117,CANTO I,"Beyond our mortal wont, I fix’d mine eyes"
118,CANTO I,"Upon the sun. Much is allowed us there,"
119,CANTO I,That here exceeds our pow’r; thanks to the place
120,CANTO I,Made for the dwelling of the human kind
121,CANTO I,
122,CANTO I,"I suffer’d it not long, and yet so long"
123,CANTO I,"That I beheld it bick’ring sparks around,"
124,CANTO I,As iron that comes boiling from the fire.
125,CANTO I,And suddenly upon the day appear’d
126,CANTO I,"A day new-ris’n, as he, who hath the power,"
127,CANTO I,Had with another sun bedeck’d the sky.
128,CANTO I,
129,CANTO I,"Her eyes fast fix’d on the eternal wheels,"
130,CANTO I,Beatrice stood unmov’d; and I with ken
131,CANTO I,"Fix’d upon her, from upward gaze remov’d"
132,CANTO I,"At her aspect, such inwardly became"
133,CANTO I,"As Glaucus, when he tasted of the herb,"
134,CANTO I,That made him peer among the ocean gods;
135,CANTO I,Words may not tell of that transhuman change:
136,CANTO I,"And therefore let the example serve, though weak,"
137,CANTO I,For those whom grace hath better proof in store
138,CANTO I,
139,CANTO I,"If I were only what thou didst create,"
140,CANTO I,"Then newly, Love! by whom the heav’n is rul’d,"
141,CANTO I,"Thou know’st, who by thy light didst bear me up."
142,CANTO I,"Whenas the wheel which thou dost ever guide,"
143,CANTO I,Desired Spirit! with its harmony
144,CANTO I,"Temper’d of thee and measur’d, charm’d mine ear,"
145,CANTO I,Then seem’d to me so much of heav’n to blaze
146,CANTO I,"With the sun’s flame, that rain or flood ne’er made"
147,CANTO I,"A lake so broad. The newness of the sound,"
148,CANTO I,"And that great light, inflam’d me with desire,"
149,CANTO I,"Keener than e’er was felt, to know their cause."
150,CANTO I,
151,CANTO I,"Whence she who saw me, clearly as myself,"
152,CANTO I,"To calm my troubled mind, before I ask’d,"
153,CANTO I,"Open’d her lips, and gracious thus began:"
154,CANTO I,“With false imagination thou thyself
155,CANTO I,"Mak’st dull, so that thou seest not the thing,"
156,CANTO I,"Which thou hadst seen, had that been shaken off."
157,CANTO I,Thou art not on the earth as thou believ’st;
158,CANTO I,For light’ning scap’d from its own proper place
159,CANTO I,"Ne’er ran, as thou hast hither now return’d.”"
160,CANTO I,
161,CANTO I,"Although divested of my first-rais’d doubt,"
162,CANTO I,"By those brief words, accompanied with smiles,"
163,CANTO I,"Yet in new doubt was I entangled more,"
164,CANTO I,"And said: “Already satisfied, I rest"
165,CANTO I,"From admiration deep, but now admire"
166,CANTO I,How I above those lighter bodies rise.”
167,CANTO I,
168,CANTO I,"Whence, after utt’rance of a piteous sigh,"
169,CANTO I,"She tow’rds me bent her eyes, with such a look,"
170,CANTO I,As on her frenzied child a mother casts;
171,CANTO I,Then thus began: “Among themselves all things
172,CANTO I,"Have order; and from hence the form, which makes"
173,CANTO I,The universe resemble God. In this
174,CANTO I,The higher creatures see the printed steps
175,CANTO I,"Of that eternal worth, which is the end"
176,CANTO I,"Whither the line is drawn. All natures lean,"
177,CANTO I,"In this their order, diversely, some more,"
178,CANTO I,Some less approaching to their primal source.
179,CANTO I,Thus they to different havens are mov’d on
180,CANTO I,"Through the vast sea of being, and each one"
181,CANTO I,"With instinct giv’n, that bears it in its course;"
182,CANTO I,"This to the lunar sphere directs the fire,"
183,CANTO I,"This prompts the hearts of mortal animals,"
184,CANTO I,"This the brute earth together knits, and binds."
185,CANTO I,"Nor only creatures, void of intellect,"
186,CANTO I,"Are aim’d at by this bow; but even those,"
187,CANTO I,"That have intelligence and love, are pierc’d."
188,CANTO I,"That Providence, who so well orders all,"
189,CANTO I,"With her own light makes ever calm the heaven,"
190,CANTO I,"In which the substance, that hath greatest speed,"
191,CANTO I,"Is turn’d: and thither now, as to our seat"
192,CANTO I,"Predestin’d, we are carried by the force"
193,CANTO I,"Of that strong cord, that never looses dart,"
194,CANTO I,"But at fair aim and glad. Yet is it true,"
195,CANTO I,That as ofttimes but ill accords the form
196,CANTO I,"To the design of art, through sluggishness"
197,CANTO I,"Of unreplying matter, so this course"
198,CANTO I,"Is sometimes quitted by the creature, who"
199,CANTO I,"Hath power, directed thus, to bend elsewhere;"
200,CANTO I,"As from a cloud the fire is seen to fall,"
201,CANTO I,"From its original impulse warp’d, to earth,"
202,CANTO I,By vicious fondness. Thou no more admire
203,CANTO I,"Thy soaring, (if I rightly deem,) than lapse"
204,CANTO I,Of torrent downwards from a mountain’s height.
205,CANTO I,"There would in thee for wonder be more cause,"
206,CANTO I,"If, free of hind’rance, thou hadst fix’d thyself"
207,CANTO I,"Below, like fire unmoving on the earth.”"
208,CANTO I,
209,CANTO I,"So said, she turn’d toward the heav’n her face."
210,CANTO I,

214,CANTO II,CANTO II
215,CANTO II,
216,CANTO II,
217,CANTO II,"All ye, who in small bark have following sail’d,"
218,CANTO II,"Eager to listen, on the advent’rous track"
219,CANTO II,"Of my proud keel, that singing cuts its way,"
220,CANTO II,"Backward return with speed, and your own shores"
221,CANTO II,"Revisit, nor put out to open sea,"
222,CANTO II,"Where losing me, perchance ye may remain"
223,CANTO II,Bewilder’d in deep maze. The way I pass
224,CANTO II,"Ne’er yet was run: Minerva breathes the gale,"
225,CANTO II,"Apollo guides me, and another Nine"
226,CANTO II,To my rapt sight the arctic beams reveal.
227,CANTO II,"Ye other few, who have outstretch’d the neck."
228,CANTO II,"Timely for food of angels, on which here"
229,CANTO II,"They live, yet never know satiety,"
230,CANTO II,Through the deep brine ye fearless may put out
231,CANTO II,"Your vessel, marking, well the furrow broad"
232,CANTO II,"Before you in the wave, that on both sides"
233,CANTO II,"Equal returns. Those, glorious, who pass’d o’er"
234,CANTO II,"To Colchos, wonder’d not as ye will do,"
235,CANTO II,When they saw Jason following the plough.
236,CANTO II,
237,CANTO II,"The increate perpetual thirst, that draws"
238,CANTO II,"Toward the realm of God’s own form, bore us"
239,CANTO II,Swift almost as the heaven ye behold.
240,CANTO II,
241,CANTO II,"Beatrice upward gaz’d, and I on her,"
242,CANTO II,And in such space as on the notch a dart
243,CANTO II,"Is plac’d, then loosen’d flies, I saw myself"
244,CANTO II,"Arriv’d, where wond’rous thing engag’d my sight."
245,CANTO II,"Whence she, to whom no work of mine was hid,"
246,CANTO II,"Turning to me, with aspect glad as fair,"
247,CANTO II,Bespake me: “Gratefully direct thy mind
248,CANTO II,"To God, through whom to this first star we come.”"
249,CANTO II,
250,CANTO II,"Me seem’d as if a cloud had cover’d us,"
251,CANTO II,"Translucent, solid, firm, and polish’d bright,"
252,CANTO II,"Like adamant, which the sun’s beam had smit"
253,CANTO II,Within itself the ever-during pearl
254,CANTO II,"Receiv’d us, as the wave a ray of light"
255,CANTO II,"Receives, and rests unbroken. If I then"
256,CANTO II,"Was of corporeal frame, and it transcend"
257,CANTO II,"Our weaker thought, how one dimension thus"
258,CANTO II,"Another could endure, which needs must be"
259,CANTO II,"If body enter body, how much more"
260,CANTO II,Must the desire inflame us to behold
261,CANTO II,"That essence, which discovers by what means"
262,CANTO II,God and our nature join’d! There will be seen
263,CANTO II,"That which we hold through faith, not shown by proof,"
264,CANTO II,"But in itself intelligibly plain,"
265,CANTO II,E’en as the truth that man at first believes.
266,CANTO II,
267,CANTO II,"I answered: “Lady! I with thoughts devout,"
268,CANTO II,"Such as I best can frame, give thanks to Him,"
269,CANTO II,Who hath remov’d me from the mortal world.
270,CANTO II,"But tell, I pray thee, whence the gloomy spots"
271,CANTO II,"Upon this body, which below on earth"
272,CANTO II,Give rise to talk of Cain in fabling quaint?”
273,CANTO II,
274,CANTO II,"She somewhat smil’d, then spake: “If mortals err"
275,CANTO II,"In their opinion, when the key of sense"
276,CANTO II,"Unlocks not, surely wonder’s weapon keen"
277,CANTO II,"Ought not to pierce thee; since thou find’st, the wings"
278,CANTO II,Of reason to pursue the senses’ flight
279,CANTO II,"Are short. But what thy own thought is, declare.”"
280,CANTO II,
281,CANTO II,"Then I: “What various here above appears,"
282,CANTO II,"Is caus’d, I deem, by bodies dense or rare.”"
283,CANTO II,
284,CANTO II,She then resum’d: “Thou certainly wilt see
285,CANTO II,"In falsehood thy belief o’erwhelm’d, if well"
286,CANTO II,"Thou listen to the arguments, which I"
287,CANTO II,Shall bring to face it. The eighth sphere displays
288,CANTO II,"Numberless lights, the which in kind and size"
289,CANTO II,May be remark’d of different aspects;
290,CANTO II,"If rare or dense of that were cause alone,"
291,CANTO II,"One single virtue then would be in all,"
292,CANTO II,"Alike distributed, or more, or less."
293,CANTO II,Different virtues needs must be the fruits
294,CANTO II,"Of formal principles, and these, save one,"
295,CANTO II,"Will by thy reasoning be destroy’d. Beside,"
296,CANTO II,"If rarity were of that dusk the cause,"
297,CANTO II,"Which thou inquirest, either in some part"
298,CANTO II,"That planet must throughout be void, nor fed"
299,CANTO II,"With its own matter; or, as bodies share"
300,CANTO II,"Their fat and leanness, in like manner this"
301,CANTO II,"Must in its volume change the leaves. The first,"
302,CANTO II,"If it were true, had through the sun’s eclipse"
303,CANTO II,"Been manifested, by transparency"
304,CANTO II,"Of light, as through aught rare beside effus’d."
305,CANTO II,But this is not. Therefore remains to see
306,CANTO II,"The other cause: and if the other fall,"
307,CANTO II,Erroneous so must prove what seem’d to thee.
308,CANTO II,If not from side to side this rarity
309,CANTO II,"Pass through, there needs must be a limit, whence"
310,CANTO II,Its contrary no further lets it pass.
311,CANTO II,"And hence the beam, that from without proceeds,"
312,CANTO II,"Must be pour’d back, as colour comes, through glass"
313,CANTO II,"Reflected, which behind it lead conceals."
314,CANTO II,"Now wilt thou say, that there of murkier hue"
315,CANTO II,"Than in the other part the ray is shown,"
316,CANTO II,By being thence refracted farther back.
317,CANTO II,From this perplexity will free thee soon
318,CANTO II,"Experience, if thereof thou trial make,"
319,CANTO II,The fountain whence your arts derive their streame.
320,CANTO II,"Three mirrors shalt thou take, and two remove"
321,CANTO II,"From thee alike, and more remote the third."
322,CANTO II,"Betwixt the former pair, shall meet thine eyes;"
323,CANTO II,"Then turn’d toward them, cause behind thy back"
324,CANTO II,"A light to stand, that on the three shall shine,"
325,CANTO II,And thus reflected come to thee from all.
326,CANTO II,Though that beheld most distant do not stretch
327,CANTO II,"A space so ample, yet in brightness thou"
328,CANTO II,"Will own it equaling the rest. But now,"
329,CANTO II,"As under snow the ground, if the warm ray"
330,CANTO II,"Smites it, remains dismantled of the hue"
331,CANTO II,"And cold, that cover’d it before, so thee,"
332,CANTO II,"Dismantled in thy mind, I will inform"
333,CANTO II,"With light so lively, that the tremulous beam"
334,CANTO II,"Shall quiver where it falls. Within the heaven,"
335,CANTO II,"Where peace divine inhabits, circles round"
336,CANTO II,"A body, in whose virtue dies the being"
337,CANTO II,"Of all that it contains. The following heaven,"
338,CANTO II,"That hath so many lights, this being divides,"
339,CANTO II,"Through different essences, from it distinct,"
340,CANTO II,And yet contain’d within it. The other orbs
341,CANTO II,Their separate distinctions variously
342,CANTO II,"Dispose, for their own seed and produce apt."
343,CANTO II,"Thus do these organs of the world proceed,"
344,CANTO II,"As thou beholdest now, from step to step,"
345,CANTO II,"Their influences from above deriving,"
346,CANTO II,"And thence transmitting downwards. Mark me well,"
347,CANTO II,"How through this passage to the truth I ford,"
348,CANTO II,"The truth thou lov’st, that thou henceforth alone,"
349,CANTO II,"May’st know to keep the shallows, safe, untold."
350,CANTO II,
351,CANTO II,"“The virtue and motion of the sacred orbs,"
352,CANTO II,"As mallet by the workman’s hand, must needs"
353,CANTO II,"By blessed movers be inspir’d. This heaven,"
354,CANTO II,"Made beauteous by so many luminaries,"
355,CANTO II,"From the deep spirit, that moves its circling sphere,"
356,CANTO II,Its image takes an impress as a seal:
357,CANTO II,"And as the soul, that dwells within your dust,"
358,CANTO II,"Through members different, yet together form’d,"
359,CANTO II,In different pow’rs resolves itself; e’en so
360,CANTO II,The intellectual efficacy unfolds
361,CANTO II,Its goodness multiplied throughout the stars;
362,CANTO II,On its own unity revolving still.
363,CANTO II,Different virtue compact different
364,CANTO II,"Makes with the precious body it enlivens,"
365,CANTO II,"With which it knits, as life in you is knit."
366,CANTO II,"From its original nature full of joy,"
367,CANTO II,"The virtue mingled through the body shines,"
368,CANTO II,As joy through pupil of the living eye.
369,CANTO II,"From hence proceeds, that which from light to light"
370,CANTO II,"Seems different, and not from dense or rare."
371,CANTO II,"This is the formal cause, that generates"
372,CANTO II,"Proportion’d to its power, the dusk or clear.”"
373,CANTO II,
374,CANTO II,
375,CANTO II,
376,CANTO II,
377,CANTO III,CANTO III
378,CANTO III,
379,CANTO III,
380,CANTO III,"That sun, which erst with love my bosom warm’d"
381,CANTO III,"Had of fair truth unveil’d the sweet aspect,"
382,CANTO III,"By proof of right, and of the false reproof;"
383,CANTO III,"And I, to own myself convinc’d and free"
384,CANTO III,"Of doubt, as much as needed, rais’d my head"
385,CANTO III,"Erect for speech. But soon a sight appear’d,"
386,CANTO III,"Which, so intent to mark it, held me fix’d,"
387,CANTO III,That of confession I no longer thought.
388,CANTO III,
389,CANTO III,"As through translucent and smooth glass, or wave"
390,CANTO III,"Clear and unmov’d, and flowing not so deep"
391,CANTO III,"As that its bed is dark, the shape returns"
392,CANTO III,"So faint of our impictur’d lineaments,"
393,CANTO III,That on white forehead set a pearl as strong
394,CANTO III,"Comes to the eye: such saw I many a face,"
395,CANTO III,"All stretch’d to speak, from whence I straight conceiv’d"
396,CANTO III,"Delusion opposite to that, which rais’d"
397,CANTO III,"Between the man and fountain, amorous flame."
398,CANTO III,
399,CANTO III,"Sudden, as I perceiv’d them, deeming these"
400,CANTO III,Reflected semblances to see of whom
401,CANTO III,"They were, I turn’d mine eyes, and nothing saw;"
402,CANTO III,"Then turn’d them back, directed on the light"
403,CANTO III,"Of my sweet guide, who smiling shot forth beams"
404,CANTO III,"From her celestial eyes. “Wonder not thou,”"
405,CANTO III,"She cry’d, “at this my smiling, when I see"
406,CANTO III,Thy childish judgment; since not yet on truth
407,CANTO III,"It rests the foot, but, as it still is wont,"
408,CANTO III,Makes thee fall back in unsound vacancy.
409,CANTO III,"True substances are these, which thou behold’st,"
410,CANTO III,Hither through failure of their vow exil’d.
411,CANTO III,"But speak thou with them; listen, and believe,"
412,CANTO III,"That the true light, which fills them with desire,"
413,CANTO III,Permits not from its beams their feet to stray.”
414,CANTO III,
415,CANTO III,Straight to the shadow which for converse seem’d
416,CANTO III,"Most earnest, I addressed me, and began,"
417,CANTO III,As one by over-eagerness perplex’d:
418,CANTO III,"“O spirit, born for joy! who in the rays"
419,CANTO III,"Of life eternal, of that sweetness know’st"
420,CANTO III,"The flavour, which, not tasted, passes far"
421,CANTO III,"All apprehension, me it well would please,"
422,CANTO III,"If thou wouldst tell me of thy name, and this"
423,CANTO III,"Your station here.” Whence she, with kindness prompt,"
424,CANTO III,"And eyes glist’ning with smiles: “Our charity,"
425,CANTO III,"To any wish by justice introduc’d,"
426,CANTO III,"Bars not the door, no more than she above,"
427,CANTO III,Who would have all her court be like herself.
428,CANTO III,I was a virgin sister in the earth;
429,CANTO III,"And if thy mind observe me well, this form,"
430,CANTO III,"With such addition grac’d of loveliness,"
431,CANTO III,"Will not conceal me long, but thou wilt know"
432,CANTO III,"Piccarda, in the tardiest sphere thus plac’d,"
433,CANTO III,Here ’mid these other blessed also blest.
434,CANTO III,"Our hearts, whose high affections burn alone"
435,CANTO III,"With pleasure, from the Holy Spirit conceiv’d,"
436,CANTO III,Admitted to his order dwell in joy.
437,CANTO III,"And this condition, which appears so low,"
438,CANTO III,"Is for this cause assign’d us, that our vows"
439,CANTO III,Were in some part neglected and made void.”
440,CANTO III,
441,CANTO III,Whence I to her replied: “Something divine
442,CANTO III,"Beams in your countenance, wond’rous fair,"
443,CANTO III,From former knowledge quite transmuting you.
444,CANTO III,Therefore to recollect was I so slow.
445,CANTO III,But what thou sayst hath to my memory
446,CANTO III,"Given now such aid, that to retrace your forms"
447,CANTO III,"Is easier. Yet inform me, ye, who here"
448,CANTO III,"Are happy, long ye for a higher place"
449,CANTO III,"More to behold, and more in love to dwell?”"
450,CANTO III,
451,CANTO III,"She with those other spirits gently smil’d,"
452,CANTO III,"Then answer’d with such gladness, that she seem’d"
453,CANTO III,With love’s first flame to glow: “Brother! our will
454,CANTO III,Is in composure settled by the power
455,CANTO III,"Of charity, who makes us will alone"
456,CANTO III,"What we possess, and nought beyond desire;"
457,CANTO III,"If we should wish to be exalted more,"
458,CANTO III,Then must our wishes jar with the high will
459,CANTO III,"Of him, who sets us here, which in these orbs"
460,CANTO III,"Thou wilt confess not possible, if here"
461,CANTO III,"To be in charity must needs befall,"
462,CANTO III,And if her nature well thou contemplate.
463,CANTO III,Rather it is inherent in this state
464,CANTO III,"Of blessedness, to keep ourselves within"
465,CANTO III,"The divine will, by which our wills with his"
466,CANTO III,Are one. So that as we from step to step
467,CANTO III,"Are plac’d throughout this kingdom, pleases all,"
468,CANTO III,"E’en as our King, who in us plants his will;"
469,CANTO III,And in his will is our tranquillity;
470,CANTO III,"It is the mighty ocean, whither tends"
471,CANTO III,Whatever it creates and nature makes.”
472,CANTO III,
473,CANTO III,Then saw I clearly how each spot in heav’n
474,CANTO III,"Is Paradise, though with like gracious dew"
475,CANTO III,The supreme virtue show’r not over all.
476,CANTO III,
477,CANTO III,"But as it chances, if one sort of food"
478,CANTO III,"Hath satiated, and of another still"
479,CANTO III,"The appetite remains, that this is ask’d,"
480,CANTO III,And thanks for that return’d; e’en so did I
481,CANTO III,"In word and motion, bent from her to learn"
482,CANTO III,"What web it was, through which she had not drawn"
483,CANTO III,The shuttle to its point. She thus began:
484,CANTO III,“Exalted worth and perfectness of life
485,CANTO III,"The Lady higher up enshrine in heaven,"
486,CANTO III,By whose pure laws upon your nether earth
487,CANTO III,"The robe and veil they wear, to that intent,"
488,CANTO III,That e’en till death they may keep watch or sleep
489,CANTO III,"With their great bridegroom, who accepts each vow,"
490,CANTO III,Which to his gracious pleasure love conforms.
491,CANTO III,"from the world, to follow her, when young"
492,CANTO III,"Escap’d; and, in her vesture mantling me,"
493,CANTO III,Made promise of the way her sect enjoins.
494,CANTO III,"Thereafter men, for ill than good more apt,"
495,CANTO III,Forth snatch’d me from the pleasant cloister’s pale.
496,CANTO III,God knows how after that my life was fram’d.
497,CANTO III,"This other splendid shape, which thou beholdst"
498,CANTO III,"At my right side, burning with all the light"
499,CANTO III,"Of this our orb, what of myself I tell"
500,CANTO III,"May to herself apply. From her, like me"
501,CANTO III,"A sister, with like violence were torn"
502,CANTO III,"The saintly folds, that shaded her fair brows."
503,CANTO III,E’en when she to the world again was brought
504,CANTO III,"In spite of her own will and better wont,"
505,CANTO III,Yet not for that the bosom’s inward veil
506,CANTO III,Did she renounce. This is the luminary
507,CANTO III,"Of mighty Constance, who from that loud blast,"
508,CANTO III,"Which blew the second over Suabia’s realm,"
509,CANTO III,"That power produc’d, which was the third and last.”"
510,CANTO III,
511,CANTO III,"She ceas’d from further talk, and then began"
512,CANTO III,"“Ave Maria” singing, and with that song"
513,CANTO III,"Vanish’d, as heavy substance through deep wave."
514,CANTO III,
515,CANTO III,"Mine eye, that far as it was capable,"
516,CANTO III,"Pursued her, when in dimness she was lost,"
517,CANTO III,"Turn’d to the mark where greater want impell’d,"
518,CANTO III,And bent on Beatrice all its gaze.
519,CANTO III,But she as light’ning beam’d upon my looks:
520,CANTO III,So that the sight sustain’d it not at first.
521,CANTO III,Whence I to question her became less prompt.
522,CANTO III,
523,CANTO III,
524,CANTO III,
525,CANTO III,
526,CANTO IV,CANTO IV
527,CANTO IV,
528,CANTO IV,
529,CANTO IV,"Between two kinds of food, both equally"
530,CANTO IV,"Remote and tempting, first a man might die"
531,CANTO IV,"Of hunger, ere he one could freely choose."
532,CANTO IV,E’en so would stand a lamb between the maw
533,CANTO IV,"Of two fierce wolves, in dread of both alike:"
534,CANTO IV,"E’en so between two deer a dog would stand,"
535,CANTO IV,"Wherefore, if I was silent, fault nor praise"
536,CANTO IV,"I to myself impute, by equal doubts"
537,CANTO IV,"Held in suspense, since of necessity"
538,CANTO IV,"It happen’d. Silent was I, yet desire"
539,CANTO IV,Was painted in my looks; and thus I spake
540,CANTO IV,My wish more earnestly than language could.
541,CANTO IV,
542,CANTO IV,"As Daniel, when the haughty king he freed"
543,CANTO IV,"From ire, that spurr’d him on to deeds unjust"
544,CANTO IV,And violent; so look’d Beatrice then.
545,CANTO IV,
546,CANTO IV,"“Well I discern,” she thus her words address’d,"
547,CANTO IV,"“How contrary desires each way constrain thee,"
548,CANTO IV,So that thy anxious thought is in itself
549,CANTO IV,"Bound up and stifled, nor breathes freely forth."
550,CANTO IV,Thou arguest; if the good intent remain;
551,CANTO IV,What reason that another’s violence
552,CANTO IV,Should stint the measure of my fair desert?
553,CANTO IV,
554,CANTO IV,"“Cause too thou findst for doubt, in that it seems,"
555,CANTO IV,"That spirits to the stars, as Plato deem’d,"
556,CANTO IV,Return. These are the questions which thy will
557,CANTO IV,Urge equally; and therefore I the first
558,CANTO IV,Of that will treat which hath the more of gall.
559,CANTO IV,"Of seraphim he who is most ensky’d,"
560,CANTO IV,"Moses and Samuel, and either John,"
561,CANTO IV,"Choose which thou wilt, nor even Mary’s self,"
562,CANTO IV,"Have not in any other heav’n their seats,"
563,CANTO IV,Than have those spirits which so late thou saw’st;
564,CANTO IV,Nor more or fewer years exist; but all
565,CANTO IV,"Make the first circle beauteous, diversely"
566,CANTO IV,"Partaking of sweet life, as more or less"
567,CANTO IV,Afflation of eternal bliss pervades them.
568,CANTO IV,"Here were they shown thee, not that fate assigns"
569,CANTO IV,"This for their sphere, but for a sign to thee"
570,CANTO IV,Of that celestial furthest from the height.
571,CANTO IV,"Thus needs, that ye may apprehend, we speak:"
572,CANTO IV,Since from things sensible alone ye learn
573,CANTO IV,"That, which digested rightly after turns"
574,CANTO IV,To intellectual. For no other cause
575,CANTO IV,"The scripture, condescending graciously"
576,CANTO IV,"To your perception, hands and feet to God"
577,CANTO IV,"Attributes, nor so means: and holy church"
578,CANTO IV,Doth represent with human countenance
579,CANTO IV,"Gabriel, and Michael, and him who made"
580,CANTO IV,"Tobias whole. Unlike what here thou seest,"
581,CANTO IV,"The judgment of Timaeus, who affirms"
582,CANTO IV,"Each soul restor’d to its particular star,"
583,CANTO IV,"Believing it to have been taken thence,"
584,CANTO IV,When nature gave it to inform her mold:
585,CANTO IV,Since to appearance his intention is
586,CANTO IV,E’en what his words declare: or else to shun
587,CANTO IV,"Derision, haply thus he hath disguis’d"
588,CANTO IV,"His true opinion. If his meaning be,"
589,CANTO IV,That to the influencing of these orbs revert
590,CANTO IV,"The honour and the blame in human acts,"
591,CANTO IV,Perchance he doth not wholly miss the truth.
592,CANTO IV,"This principle, not understood aright,"
593,CANTO IV,Erewhile perverted well nigh all the world;
594,CANTO IV,"So that it fell to fabled names of Jove,"
595,CANTO IV,"And Mercury, and Mars. That other doubt,"
596,CANTO IV,"Which moves thee, is less harmful; for it brings"
597,CANTO IV,No peril of removing thee from me.
598,CANTO IV,
599,CANTO IV,"“That, to the eye of man, our justice seems"
600,CANTO IV,"Unjust, is argument for faith, and not"
601,CANTO IV,For heretic declension. To the end
602,CANTO IV,"This truth may stand more clearly in your view,"
603,CANTO IV,I will content thee even to thy wish
604,CANTO IV,
605,CANTO IV,"“If violence be, when that which suffers, nought"
606,CANTO IV,"Consents to that which forceth, not for this"
607,CANTO IV,"These spirits stood exculpate. For the will,"
608,CANTO IV,"That will not, still survives unquench’d, and doth"
609,CANTO IV,"As nature doth in fire, tho’ violence"
610,CANTO IV,"Wrest it a thousand times; for, if it yield"
611,CANTO IV,"Or more or less, so far it follows force."
612,CANTO IV,"And thus did these, whom they had power to seek"
613,CANTO IV,"The hallow’d place again. In them, had will"
614,CANTO IV,"Been perfect, such as once upon the bars"
615,CANTO IV,"Held Laurence firm, or wrought in Scaevola"
616,CANTO IV,"To his own hand remorseless, to the path,"
617,CANTO IV,"Whence they were drawn, their steps had hasten’d back,"
618,CANTO IV,When liberty return’d: but in too few
619,CANTO IV,Resolve so steadfast dwells. And by these words
620,CANTO IV,"If duly weigh’d, that argument is void,"
621,CANTO IV,Which oft might have perplex’d thee still. But now
622,CANTO IV,"Another question thwarts thee, which to solve"
623,CANTO IV,Might try thy patience without better aid.
624,CANTO IV,"I have, no doubt, instill’d into thy mind,"
625,CANTO IV,That blessed spirit may not lie; since near
626,CANTO IV,The source of primal truth it dwells for aye:
627,CANTO IV,And thou might’st after of Piccarda learn
628,CANTO IV,That Constance held affection to the veil;
629,CANTO IV,So that she seems to contradict me here.
630,CANTO IV,"Not seldom, brother, it hath chanc’d for men"
631,CANTO IV,"To do what they had gladly left undone,"
632,CANTO IV,Yet to shun peril they have done amiss:
633,CANTO IV,"E’en as Alcmaeon, at his father’s suit"
634,CANTO IV,"Slew his own mother, so made pitiless"
635,CANTO IV,"Not to lose pity. On this point bethink thee,"
636,CANTO IV,That force and will are blended in such wise
637,CANTO IV,As not to make the’ offence excusable.
638,CANTO IV,"Absolute will agrees not to the wrong,"
639,CANTO IV,That inasmuch as there is fear of woe
640,CANTO IV,"From non-compliance, it agrees. Of will"
641,CANTO IV,"Thus absolute Piccarda spake, and I"
642,CANTO IV,Of th’ other; so that both have truly said.”
643,CANTO IV,
644,CANTO IV,"Such was the flow of that pure rill, that well’d"
645,CANTO IV,From forth the fountain of all truth; and such
646,CANTO IV,"The rest, that to my wond’ring thoughts I found."
647,CANTO IV,
648,CANTO IV,“O thou of primal love the prime delight!
649,CANTO IV,"Goddess!” I straight reply’d, “whose lively words"
650,CANTO IV,Still shed new heat and vigour through my soul!
651,CANTO IV,Affection fails me to requite thy grace
652,CANTO IV,With equal sum of gratitude: be his
653,CANTO IV,"To recompense, who sees and can reward thee."
654,CANTO IV,"Well I discern, that by that truth alone"
655,CANTO IV,"Enlighten’d, beyond which no truth may roam,"
656,CANTO IV,Our mind can satisfy her thirst to know:
657,CANTO IV,"Therein she resteth, e’en as in his lair"
658,CANTO IV,"The wild beast, soon as she hath reach’d that bound,"
659,CANTO IV,And she hath power to reach it; else desire
660,CANTO IV,Were given to no end. And thence doth doubt
661,CANTO IV,"Spring, like a shoot, around the stock of truth;"
662,CANTO IV,And it is nature which from height to height
663,CANTO IV,"On to the summit prompts us. This invites,"
664,CANTO IV,"This doth assure me, lady, rev’rently"
665,CANTO IV,"To ask thee of other truth, that yet"
666,CANTO IV,"Is dark to me. I fain would know, if man"
667,CANTO IV,By other works well done may so supply
668,CANTO IV,"The failure of his vows, that in your scale"
669,CANTO IV,They lack not weight.” I spake; and on me straight
670,CANTO IV,Beatrice look’d with eyes that shot forth sparks
671,CANTO IV,"Of love celestial in such copious stream,"
672,CANTO IV,"That, virtue sinking in me overpower’d,"
673,CANTO IV,"I turn’d, and downward bent confus’d my sight."
674,CANTO IV,
675,CANTO IV,
676,CANTO IV,
677,CANTO IV,
678,CANTO V,CANTO V
679,CANTO V,
680,CANTO V,
681,CANTO V,"“If beyond earthly wont, the flame of love"
682,CANTO V,"Illume me, so that I o’ercome thy power"
683,CANTO V,"Of vision, marvel not: but learn the cause"
684,CANTO V,"In that perfection of the sight, which soon"
685,CANTO V,"As apprehending, hasteneth on to reach"
686,CANTO V,"The good it apprehends. I well discern,"
687,CANTO V,How in thine intellect already shines
688,CANTO V,"The light eternal, which to view alone"
689,CANTO V,Ne’er fails to kindle love; and if aught else
690,CANTO V,"Your love seduces, ’tis but that it shows"
691,CANTO V,Some ill-mark’d vestige of that primal beam.
692,CANTO V,
693,CANTO V,"“This would’st thou know, if failure of the vow"
694,CANTO V,"By other service may be so supplied,"
695,CANTO V,As from self-question to assure the soul.”
696,CANTO V,
697,CANTO V,"Thus she her words, not heedless of my wish,"
698,CANTO V,"Began; and thus, as one who breaks not off"
699,CANTO V,"Discourse, continued in her saintly strain."
700,CANTO V,"“Supreme of gifts, which God creating gave"
701,CANTO V,"Of his free bounty, sign most evident"
702,CANTO V,"Of goodness, and in his account most priz’d,"
703,CANTO V,"Was liberty of will, the boon wherewith"
704,CANTO V,"All intellectual creatures, and them sole"
705,CANTO V,He hath endow’d. Hence now thou mayst infer
706,CANTO V,"Of what high worth the vow, which so is fram’d"
707,CANTO V,"That when man offers, God well-pleas’d accepts;"
708,CANTO V,"For in the compact between God and him,"
709,CANTO V,"This treasure, such as I describe it to thee,"
710,CANTO V,"He makes the victim, and of his own act."
711,CANTO V,What compensation therefore may he find?
712,CANTO V,"If that, whereof thou hast oblation made,"
713,CANTO V,"By using well thou think’st to consecrate,"
714,CANTO V,Thou would’st of theft do charitable deed.
715,CANTO V,Thus I resolve thee of the greater point.
716,CANTO V,
717,CANTO V,"“But forasmuch as holy church, herein"
718,CANTO V,"Dispensing, seems to contradict the truth"
719,CANTO V,"I have discover’d to thee, yet behooves"
720,CANTO V,"Thou rest a little longer at the board,"
721,CANTO V,"Ere the crude aliment, which thou hast taken,"
722,CANTO V,Digested fitly to nutrition turn.
723,CANTO V,"Open thy mind to what I now unfold,"
724,CANTO V,And give it inward keeping. Knowledge comes
725,CANTO V,"Of learning well retain’d, unfruitful else."
726,CANTO V,
727,CANTO V,“This sacrifice in essence of two things
728,CANTO V,"Consisteth; one is that, whereof ’tis made,"
729,CANTO V,"The covenant the other. For the last,"
730,CANTO V,It ne’er is cancell’d if not kept: and hence
731,CANTO V,I spake erewhile so strictly of its force.
732,CANTO V,"For this it was enjoin’d the Israelites,"
733,CANTO V,"Though leave were giv’n them, as thou know’st, to change"
734,CANTO V,"The offering, still to offer. Th’ other part,"
735,CANTO V,"The matter and the substance of the vow,"
736,CANTO V,"May well be such, to that without offence"
737,CANTO V,It may for other substance be exchang’d.
738,CANTO V,But at his own discretion none may shift
739,CANTO V,"The burden on his shoulders, unreleas’d"
740,CANTO V,"By either key, the yellow and the white."
741,CANTO V,"Nor deem of any change, as less than vain,"
742,CANTO V,If the last bond be not within the new
743,CANTO V,"Included, as the quatre in the six."
744,CANTO V,No satisfaction therefore can be paid
745,CANTO V,"For what so precious in the balance weighs,"
746,CANTO V,That all in counterpoise must kick the beam.
747,CANTO V,"Take then no vow at random: ta’en, with faith"
748,CANTO V,"Preserve it; yet not bent, as Jephthah once,"
749,CANTO V,"Blindly to execute a rash resolve,"
750,CANTO V,"Whom better it had suited to exclaim,"
751,CANTO V,"‘I have done ill,’ than to redeem his pledge"
752,CANTO V,"By doing worse or, not unlike to him"
753,CANTO V,"In folly, that great leader of the Greeks:"
754,CANTO V,"Whence, on the alter, Iphigenia mourn’d"
755,CANTO V,"Her virgin beauty, and hath since made mourn"
756,CANTO V,"Both wise and simple, even all, who hear"
757,CANTO V,"Of so fell sacrifice. Be ye more staid,"
758,CANTO V,"O Christians, not, like feather, by each wind"
759,CANTO V,Removable: nor think to cleanse ourselves
760,CANTO V,"In every water. Either testament,"
761,CANTO V,"The old and new, is yours: and for your guide"
762,CANTO V,The shepherd of the church let this suffice
763,CANTO V,"To save you. When by evil lust entic’d,"
764,CANTO V,"Remember ye be men, not senseless beasts;"
765,CANTO V,"Nor let the Jew, who dwelleth in your streets,"
766,CANTO V,"Hold you in mock’ry. Be not, as the lamb,"
767,CANTO V,"That, fickle wanton, leaves its mother’s milk,"
768,CANTO V,To dally with itself in idle play.”
769,CANTO V,
770,CANTO V,Such were the words that Beatrice spake:
771,CANTO V,"These ended, to that region, where the world"
772,CANTO V,"Is liveliest, full of fond desire she turn’d."
773,CANTO V,
774,CANTO V,"Though mainly prompt new question to propose,"
775,CANTO V,Her silence and chang’d look did keep me dumb.
776,CANTO V,"And as the arrow, ere the cord is still,"
777,CANTO V,Leapeth unto its mark; so on we sped
778,CANTO V,Into the second realm. There I beheld
779,CANTO V,"The dame, so joyous enter, that the orb"
780,CANTO V,"Grew brighter at her smiles; and, if the star"
781,CANTO V,"Were mov’d to gladness, what then was my cheer,"
782,CANTO V,Whom nature hath made apt for every change!
783,CANTO V,
784,CANTO V,"As in a quiet and clear lake the fish,"
785,CANTO V,"If aught approach them from without, do draw"
786,CANTO V,"Towards it, deeming it their food; so drew"
787,CANTO V,"Full more than thousand splendours towards us,"
788,CANTO V,And in each one was heard: “Lo! one arriv’d
789,CANTO V,To multiply our loves!” and as each came
790,CANTO V,"The shadow, streaming forth effulgence new,"
791,CANTO V,"Witness’d augmented joy. Here, reader! think,"
792,CANTO V,"If thou didst miss the sequel of my tale,"
793,CANTO V,To know the rest how sorely thou wouldst crave;
794,CANTO V,And thou shalt see what vehement desire
795,CANTO V,"Possess’d me, as soon as these had met my view,"
796,CANTO V,To know their state. “O born in happy hour!
797,CANTO V,"Thou to whom grace vouchsafes, or ere thy close"
798,CANTO V,"Of fleshly warfare, to behold the thrones"
799,CANTO V,"Of that eternal triumph, know to us"
800,CANTO V,"The light communicated, which through heaven"
801,CANTO V,"Expatiates without bound. Therefore, if aught"
802,CANTO V,"Thou of our beams wouldst borrow for thine aid,"
803,CANTO V,Spare not; and of our radiance take thy fill.”
804,CANTO V,
805,CANTO V,Thus of those piteous spirits one bespake me;
806,CANTO V,And Beatrice next: “Say on; and trust
807,CANTO V,As unto gods!”—“How in the light supreme
808,CANTO V,"Thou harbour’st, and from thence the virtue bring’st,"
809,CANTO V,"That, sparkling in thine eyes, denotes thy joy,"
810,CANTO V,"I mark; but, who thou art, am still to seek;"
811,CANTO V,"Or wherefore, worthy spirit! for thy lot"
812,CANTO V,"This sphere assign’d, that oft from mortal ken"
813,CANTO V,"Is veil’d by others’ beams.” I said, and turn’d"
814,CANTO V,"Toward the lustre, that with greeting, kind"
815,CANTO V,Erewhile had hail’d me. Forthwith brighter far
816,CANTO V,"Than erst, it wax’d: and, as himself the sun"
817,CANTO V,"Hides through excess of light, when his warm gaze"
818,CANTO V,Hath on the mantle of thick vapours prey’d;
819,CANTO V,Within its proper ray the saintly shape
820,CANTO V,"Was, through increase of gladness, thus conceal’d;"
821,CANTO V,"And, shrouded so in splendour answer’d me,"
822,CANTO V,E’en as the tenour of my song declares.

831,CANTO VI,"Against the motions of the heav’n, that roll’d"
832,CANTO VI,"Consenting with its course, when he of yore,"
833,CANTO VI,"Lavinia’s spouse, was leader of the flight,"
834,CANTO VI,"A hundred years twice told and more, his seat"
835,CANTO VI,"At Europe’s extreme point, the bird of Jove"
836,CANTO VI,"Held, near the mountains, whence he issued first."
837,CANTO VI,"There, under shadow of his sacred plumes"
838,CANTO VI,"Swaying the world, till through successive hands"
839,CANTO VI,"To mine he came devolv’d. Caesar I was,"
840,CANTO VI,And am Justinian; destin’d by the will
841,CANTO VI,"Of that prime love, whose influence I feel,"
842,CANTO VI,From vain excess to clear th’ encumber’d laws.
843,CANTO VI,"Or ere that work engag’d me, I did hold"
844,CANTO VI,"Christ’s nature merely human, with such faith"
845,CANTO VI,"Contented. But the blessed Agapete,"
846,CANTO VI,"Who was chief shepherd, he with warning voice"
847,CANTO VI,To the true faith recall’d me. I believ’d
848,CANTO VI,"His words: and what he taught, now plainly see,"
849,CANTO VI,As thou in every contradiction seest
850,CANTO VI,The true and false oppos’d. Soon as my feet
851,CANTO VI,"Were to the church reclaim’d, to my great task,"
852,CANTO VI,"By inspiration of God’s grace impell’d,"
853,CANTO VI,"I gave me wholly, and consign’d mine arms"
854,CANTO VI,"To Belisarius, with whom heaven’s right hand"
855,CANTO VI,"Was link’d in such conjointment, ’twas a sign"
856,CANTO VI,That I should rest. To thy first question thus
857,CANTO VI,"I shape mine answer, which were ended here,"
858,CANTO VI,But that its tendency doth prompt perforce
859,CANTO VI,"To some addition; that thou well, mayst mark"
860,CANTO VI,"What reason on each side they have to plead,"
861,CANTO VI,"By whom that holiest banner is withstood,"
862,CANTO VI,Both who pretend its power and who oppose.
863,CANTO VI,
864,CANTO VI,"“Beginning from that hour, when Pallas died"
865,CANTO VI,"To give it rule, behold the valorous deeds"
866,CANTO VI,Have made it worthy reverence. Not unknown
867,CANTO VI,"To thee, how for three hundred years and more"
868,CANTO VI,"It dwelt in Alba, up to those fell lists"
869,CANTO VI,Where for its sake were met the rival three;
870,CANTO VI,"Nor aught unknown to thee, which it achiev’d"
871,CANTO VI,"Down to the Sabines’ wrong to Lucrece’ woe,"

874,CANTO VI,"’Gainst Brennus and th’ Epirot prince, and hosts"
875,CANTO VI,"Of single chiefs, or states in league combin’d"
876,CANTO VI,"Of social warfare; hence Torquatus stern,"
877,CANTO VI,"And Quintius nam’d of his neglected locks,"
878,CANTO VI,"The Decii, and the Fabii hence acquir’d"
879,CANTO VI,"Their fame, which I with duteous zeal embalm."
880,CANTO VI,"By it the pride of Arab hordes was quell’d,"
881,CANTO VI,When they led on by Hannibal o’erpass’d
882,CANTO VI,"The Alpine rocks, whence glide thy currents, Po!"
883,CANTO VI,"Beneath its guidance, in their prime of days"
884,CANTO VI,"Scipio and Pompey triumph’d; and that hill,"
885,CANTO VI,"Under whose summit thou didst see the light,"
886,CANTO VI,"Rued its stern bearing. After, near the hour,"
887,CANTO VI,When heav’n was minded that o’er all the world
888,CANTO VI,"His own deep calm should brood, to Caesar’s hand"
889,CANTO VI,Did Rome consign it; and what then it wrought
890,CANTO VI,"From Var unto the Rhine, saw Isere’s flood,"
891,CANTO VI,"Saw Loire and Seine, and every vale, that fills"
892,CANTO VI,"The torrent Rhone. What after that it wrought,"
893,CANTO VI,"When from Ravenna it came forth, and leap’d"
894,CANTO VI,"The Rubicon, was of so bold a flight,"
895,CANTO VI,That tongue nor pen may follow it. Tow’rds Spain
896,CANTO VI,"It wheel’d its bands, then tow’rd Dyrrachium smote,"
897,CANTO VI,"And on Pharsalia with so fierce a plunge,"
898,CANTO VI,E’en the warm Nile was conscious to the pang;
899,CANTO VI,"Its native shores Antandros, and the streams"
900,CANTO VI,"Of Simois revisited, and there"
901,CANTO VI,Where Hector lies; then ill for Ptolemy
902,CANTO VI,His pennons shook again; lightning thence fell
903,CANTO VI,"On Juba; and the next upon your west,"
904,CANTO VI,"At sound of the Pompeian trump, return’d."
905,CANTO VI,
906,CANTO VI,“What following and in its next bearer’s gripe
907,CANTO VI,"It wrought, is now by Cassius and Brutus"
908,CANTO VI,"Bark’d off in hell, and by Perugia’s sons"
909,CANTO VI,And Modena’s was mourn’d. Hence weepeth still
910,CANTO VI,"Sad Cleopatra, who, pursued by it,"
911,CANTO VI,Took from the adder black and sudden death.
912,CANTO VI,With him it ran e’en to the Red Sea coast;
913,CANTO VI,"With him compos’d the world to such a peace,"
914,CANTO VI,That of his temple Janus barr’d the door.
915,CANTO VI,
916,CANTO VI,"“But all the mighty standard yet had wrought,"
917,CANTO VI,"And was appointed to perform thereafter,"
918,CANTO VI,"Throughout the mortal kingdom which it sway’d,"
919,CANTO VI,"Falls in appearance dwindled and obscur’d,"
920,CANTO VI,If one with steady eye and perfect thought
921,CANTO VI,"On the third Caesar look; for to his hands,"
922,CANTO VI,"The living Justice, in whose breath I move,"
923,CANTO VI,"Committed glory, e’en into his hands,"
924,CANTO VI,To execute the vengeance of its wrath.
925,CANTO VI,
926,CANTO VI,“Hear now and wonder at what next I tell.
927,CANTO VI,After with Titus it was sent to wreak
928,CANTO VI,"Vengeance for vengeance of the ancient sin,"
929,CANTO VI,"And, when the Lombard tooth, with fangs impure,"
930,CANTO VI,"Did gore the bosom of the holy church,"
931,CANTO VI,"Under its wings victorious, Charlemagne"
932,CANTO VI,Sped to her rescue. Judge then for thyself
933,CANTO VI,"Of those, whom I erewhile accus’d to thee,"
934,CANTO VI,"What they are, and how grievous their offending,"
935,CANTO VI,Who are the cause of all your ills. The one
936,CANTO VI,Against the universal ensign rears
937,CANTO VI,"The yellow lilies, and with partial aim"
938,CANTO VI,That to himself the other arrogates:
939,CANTO VI,So that ’tis hard to see which more offends.
940,CANTO VI,"Be yours, ye Ghibellines, to veil your arts"
941,CANTO VI,Beneath another standard: ill is this
942,CANTO VI,"Follow’d of him, who severs it and justice:"
943,CANTO VI,And let not with his Guelphs the new-crown’d Charles
944,CANTO VI,"Assail it, but those talons hold in dread,"
945,CANTO VI,Which from a lion of more lofty port
946,CANTO VI,Have rent the easing. Many a time ere now
947,CANTO VI,The sons have for the sire’s transgression wail’d;
948,CANTO VI,"Nor let him trust the fond belief, that heav’n"
949,CANTO VI,Will truck its armour for his lilied shield.
950,CANTO VI,
951,CANTO VI,"“This little star is furnish’d with good spirits,"
952,CANTO VI,"Whose mortal lives were busied to that end,"
953,CANTO VI,That honour and renown might wait on them:
954,CANTO VI,"And, when desires thus err in their intention,"
955,CANTO VI,True love must needs ascend with slacker beam.
956,CANTO VI,"But it is part of our delight, to measure"
957,CANTO VI,Our wages with the merit; and admire
958,CANTO VI,The close proportion. Hence doth heav’nly justice
959,CANTO VI,"Temper so evenly affection in us,"
960,CANTO VI,It ne’er can warp to any wrongfulness.
961,CANTO VI,Of diverse voices is sweet music made:
962,CANTO VI,So in our life the different degrees
963,CANTO VI,Render sweet harmony among these wheels.

965,CANTO VI,"“Within the pearl, that now encloseth us,"
966,CANTO VI,"Shines Romeo’s light, whose goodly deed and fair"
967,CANTO VI,"Met ill acceptance. But the Provencals,"
968,CANTO VI,"That were his foes, have little cause for mirth."
969,CANTO VI,"Ill shapes that man his course, who makes his wrong"
970,CANTO VI,Of other’s worth. Four daughters were there born
971,CANTO VI,"To Raymond Berenger, and every one"
972,CANTO VI,"Became a queen; and this for him did Romeo,"
973,CANTO VI,Though of mean state and from a foreign land.
974,CANTO VI,Yet envious tongues incited him to ask
975,CANTO VI,"A reckoning of that just one, who return’d"
976,CANTO VI,Twelve fold to him for ten. Aged and poor
977,CANTO VI,He parted thence: and if the world did know
978,CANTO VI,"The heart he had, begging his life by morsels,"

988,CANTO VII,Superillustrans claritate tua
989,CANTO VII,Felices ignes horum malahoth!”
990,CANTO VII,Thus chanting saw I turn that substance bright
991,CANTO VII,"With fourfold lustre to its orb again,"
992,CANTO VII,Revolving; and the rest unto their dance
993,CANTO VII,"With it mov’d also; and like swiftest sparks,"
994,CANTO VII,In sudden distance from my sight were veil’d.
995,CANTO VII,
996,CANTO VII,"Me doubt possess’d, and “Speak,” it whisper’d me,"
997,CANTO VII,"“Speak, speak unto thy lady, that she quench"
998,CANTO VII,"Thy thirst with drops of sweetness.” Yet blank awe,"
999,CANTO VII,"Which lords it o’er me, even at the sound"
1000,CANTO VII,"Of Beatrice’s name, did bow me down"
1001,CANTO VII,As one in slumber held. Not long that mood
1002,CANTO VII,"Beatrice suffer’d: she, with such a smile,"
1003,CANTO VII,"As might have made one blest amid the flames,"
1004,CANTO VII,"Beaming upon me, thus her words began:"
1005,CANTO VII,"“Thou in thy thought art pond’ring (as I deem),"
1006,CANTO VII,And what I deem is truth how just revenge
1007,CANTO VII,Could be with justice punish’d: from which doubt
1008,CANTO VII,I soon will free thee; so thou mark my words;
1009,CANTO VII,For they of weighty matter shall possess thee.
1010,CANTO VII,
1011,CANTO VII,"“That man, who was unborn, himself condemn’d,"
1012,CANTO VII,"And, in himself, all, who since him have liv’d,"
1013,CANTO VII,"His offspring: whence, below, the human kind"
1014,CANTO VII,Lay sick in grievous error many an age;
1015,CANTO VII,Until it pleas’d the Word of God to come
1016,CANTO VII,"Amongst them down, to his own person joining"
1017,CANTO VII,"The nature, from its Maker far estrang’d,"
1018,CANTO VII,By the mere act of his eternal love.
1019,CANTO VII,Contemplate here the wonder I unfold.
1020,CANTO VII,"The nature with its Maker thus conjoin’d,"
1021,CANTO VII,"Created first was blameless, pure and good;"
1022,CANTO VII,But through itself alone was driven forth
1023,CANTO VII,"From Paradise, because it had eschew’d"
1024,CANTO VII,"The way of truth and life, to evil turn’d."
1025,CANTO VII,Ne’er then was penalty so just as that
1026,CANTO VII,"Inflicted by the cross, if thou regard"
1027,CANTO VII,The nature in assumption doom’d: ne’er wrong
1028,CANTO VII,"So great, in reference to him, who took"
1029,CANTO VII,"Such nature on him, and endur’d the doom."
1030,CANTO VII,God therefore and the Jews one sentence pleased:
1031,CANTO VII,"So different effects flow’d from one act,"
1032,CANTO VII,"And heav’n was open’d, though the earth did quake."
1033,CANTO VII,"Count it not hard henceforth, when thou dost hear"
1034,CANTO VII,That a just vengeance was by righteous court
1035,CANTO VII,Justly reveng’d. But yet I see thy mind
1036,CANTO VII,"By thought on thought arising sore perplex’d,"
1037,CANTO VII,And with how vehement desire it asks
1038,CANTO VII,"Solution of the maze. What I have heard,"
1039,CANTO VII,"Is plain, thou sayst: but wherefore God this way"
1040,CANTO VII,"For our redemption chose, eludes my search."
1041,CANTO VII,
1042,CANTO VII,"“Brother! no eye of man not perfected,"
1043,CANTO VII,"Nor fully ripen’d in the flame of love,"
1044,CANTO VII,"May fathom this decree. It is a mark,"
1045,CANTO VII,"In sooth, much aim’d at, and but little kenn’d:"
1046,CANTO VII,And I will therefore show thee why such way
1047,CANTO VII,"Was worthiest. The celestial love, that spume"
1048,CANTO VII,"All envying in its bounty, in itself"
1049,CANTO VII,"With such effulgence blazeth, as sends forth"
1050,CANTO VII,All beauteous things eternal. What distils
1051,CANTO VII,"Immediate thence, no end of being knows,"
1052,CANTO VII,Bearing its seal immutably impress’d.
1053,CANTO VII,"Whatever thence immediate falls, is free,"
1054,CANTO VII,"Free wholly, uncontrollable by power"
1055,CANTO VII,Of each thing new: by such conformity
1056,CANTO VII,"More grateful to its author, whose bright beams,"
1057,CANTO VII,"Though all partake their shining, yet in those"
1058,CANTO VII,"Are liveliest, which resemble him the most."
1059,CANTO VII,These tokens of pre-eminence on man
1060,CANTO VII,"Largely bestow’d, if any of them fail,"
1061,CANTO VII,"He needs must forfeit his nobility,"
1062,CANTO VII,"No longer stainless. Sin alone is that,"
1063,CANTO VII,"Which doth disfranchise him, and make unlike"
1064,CANTO VII,To the chief good; for that its light in him
1065,CANTO VII,Is darken’d. And to dignity thus lost
1066,CANTO VII,"Is no return; unless, where guilt makes void,"
1067,CANTO VII,He for ill pleasure pay with equal pain.
1068,CANTO VII,"Your nature, which entirely in its seed"
1069,CANTO VII,"Trangress’d, from these distinctions fell, no less"
1070,CANTO VII,Than from its state in Paradise; nor means
1071,CANTO VII,Found of recovery (search all methods out
1072,CANTO VII,"As strickly as thou may) save one of these,"
1073,CANTO VII,"The only fords were left through which to wade,"
1074,CANTO VII,Either that God had of his courtesy
1075,CANTO VII,"Releas’d him merely, or else man himself"
1076,CANTO VII,For his own folly by himself aton’d.
1077,CANTO VII,
1078,CANTO VII,"“Fix now thine eye, intently as thou canst,"
1079,CANTO VII,"On th’ everlasting counsel, and explore,"
1080,CANTO VII,"Instructed by my words, the dread abyss."
1081,CANTO VII,
1082,CANTO VII,“Man in himself had ever lack’d the means
1083,CANTO VII,"Of satisfaction, for he could not stoop"
1084,CANTO VII,"Obeying, in humility so low,"
1085,CANTO VII,"As high he, disobeying, thought to soar:"
1086,CANTO VII,And for this reason he had vainly tried
1087,CANTO VII,Out of his own sufficiency to pay
1088,CANTO VII,The rigid satisfaction. Then behooved
1089,CANTO VII,That God should by his own ways lead him back
1090,CANTO VII,"Unto the life, from whence he fell, restor’d:"
1091,CANTO VII,"By both his ways, I mean, or one alone."
1092,CANTO VII,"But since the deed is ever priz’d the more,"
1093,CANTO VII,"The more the doer’s good intent appears,"
1094,CANTO VII,"Goodness celestial, whose broad signature"
1095,CANTO VII,"Is on the universe, of all its ways"
1096,CANTO VII,"To raise ye up, was fain to leave out none,"
1097,CANTO VII,"Nor aught so vast or so magnificent,"
1098,CANTO VII,Either for him who gave or who receiv’d
1099,CANTO VII,"Between the last night and the primal day,"
1100,CANTO VII,Was or can be. For God more bounty show’d.
1101,CANTO VII,Giving himself to make man capable
1102,CANTO VII,"Of his return to life, than had the terms"
1103,CANTO VII,Been mere and unconditional release.
1104,CANTO VII,"And for his justice, every method else"
1105,CANTO VII,"Were all too scant, had not the Son of God"
1106,CANTO VII,Humbled himself to put on mortal flesh.
1107,CANTO VII,
1108,CANTO VII,"“Now, to fulfil each wish of thine, remains"
1109,CANTO VII,I somewhat further to thy view unfold.
1110,CANTO VII,That thou mayst see as clearly as myself.
1111,CANTO VII,
1112,CANTO VII,"“I see, thou sayst, the air, the fire I see,"
1113,CANTO VII,"The earth and water, and all things of them"
1114,CANTO VII,"Compounded, to corruption turn, and soon"
1115,CANTO VII,"Dissolve. Yet these were also things create,"
1116,CANTO VII,"Because, if what were told me, had been true"
1117,CANTO VII,They from corruption had been therefore free.
1118,CANTO VII,
1119,CANTO VII,"“The angels, O my brother! and this clime"
1120,CANTO VII,"Wherein thou art, impassible and pure,"
1121,CANTO VII,"I call created, as indeed they are"
1122,CANTO VII,"In their whole being. But the elements,"
1123,CANTO VII,"Which thou hast nam’d, and what of them is made,"
1124,CANTO VII,Are by created virtue’ inform’d: create
1125,CANTO VII,"Their substance, and create the’ informing virtue"
1126,CANTO VII,"In these bright stars, that round them circling move"
1127,CANTO VII,"The soul of every brute and of each plant,"
1128,CANTO VII,"The ray and motion of the sacred lights,"
1129,CANTO VII,With complex potency attract and turn.
1130,CANTO VII,But this our life the’ eternal good inspires
1131,CANTO VII,"Immediate, and enamours of itself;"
1132,CANTO VII,So that our wishes rest for ever here.
1133,CANTO VII,
1134,CANTO VII,“And hence thou mayst by inference conclude
1135,CANTO VII,"Our resurrection certain, if thy mind"
1136,CANTO VII,"Consider how the human flesh was fram’d,"
1137,CANTO VII,When both our parents at the first were made.”

1144,CANTO VIII,
1145,CANTO VIII,The world was in its day of peril dark
1146,CANTO VIII,Wont to believe the dotage of fond love
1147,CANTO VIII,"From the fair Cyprian deity, who rolls"
1148,CANTO VIII,"In her third epicycle, shed on men"
1149,CANTO VIII,By stream of potent radiance: therefore they
1150,CANTO VIII,"Of elder time, in their old error blind,"
1151,CANTO VIII,Not her alone with sacrifice ador’d
1152,CANTO VIII,"And invocation, but like honours paid"
1153,CANTO VIII,"To Cupid and Dione, deem’d of them"
1154,CANTO VIII,"Her mother, and her son, him whom they feign’d"
1155,CANTO VIII,"To sit in Dido’s bosom: and from her,"
1156,CANTO VIII,"Whom I have sung preluding, borrow’d they"
1157,CANTO VIII,"The appellation of that star, which views,"
1158,CANTO VIII,"Now obvious and now averse, the sun."
1159,CANTO VIII,
1160,CANTO VIII,I was not ware that I was wafted up
1161,CANTO VIII,Into its orb; but the new loveliness
1162,CANTO VIII,"That grac’d my lady, gave me ample proof"
1163,CANTO VIII,That we had entered there. And as in flame
1164,CANTO VIII,"A sparkle is distinct, or voice in voice"
1165,CANTO VIII,"Discern’d, when one its even tenour keeps,"
1166,CANTO VIII,The other comes and goes; so in that light
1167,CANTO VIII,"I other luminaries saw, that cours’d"
1168,CANTO VIII,"In circling motion, rapid more or less,"
1169,CANTO VIII,As their eternal phases each impels.
1170,CANTO VIII,
1171,CANTO VIII,"Never was blast from vapour charged with cold,"
1172,CANTO VIII,"Whether invisible to eye or no,"
1173,CANTO VIII,"Descended with such speed, it had not seem’d"
1174,CANTO VIII,"To linger in dull tardiness, compar’d"
1175,CANTO VIII,"To those celestial lights, that tow’rds us came,"
1176,CANTO VIII,"Leaving the circuit of their joyous ring,"
1177,CANTO VIII,Conducted by the lofty seraphim.
1178,CANTO VIII,"And after them, who in the van appear’d,"
1179,CANTO VIII,"Such an hosanna sounded, as hath left"
1180,CANTO VIII,"Desire, ne’er since extinct in me, to hear"
1181,CANTO VIII,Renew’d the strain. Then parting from the rest
1182,CANTO VIII,"One near us drew, and sole began: “We all"
1183,CANTO VIII,"Are ready at thy pleasure, well dispos’d"
1184,CANTO VIII,"To do thee gentle service. We are they,"
1185,CANTO VIII,To whom thou in the world erewhile didst Sing
1186,CANTO VIII,‘O ye! whose intellectual ministry
1187,CANTO VIII,"Moves the third heaven!’ and in one orb we roll,"
1188,CANTO VIII,"One motion, one impulse, with those who rule"
1189,CANTO VIII,"Princedoms in heaven; yet are of love so full,"
1190,CANTO VIII,That to please thee ’twill be as sweet to rest.”
1191,CANTO VIII,
1192,CANTO VIII,After mine eyes had with meek reverence
1193,CANTO VIII,"Sought the celestial guide, and were by her"
1194,CANTO VIII,"Assur’d, they turn’d again unto the light"
1195,CANTO VIII,"Who had so largely promis’d, and with voice"
1196,CANTO VIII,"That bare the lively pressure of my zeal,"
1197,CANTO VIII,"“Tell who ye are,” I cried. Forthwith it grew"
1198,CANTO VIII,"In size and splendour, through augmented joy;"
1199,CANTO VIII,And thus it answer’d: “A short date below
1200,CANTO VIII,"The world possess’d me. Had the time been more,"
1201,CANTO VIII,"Much evil, that will come, had never chanc’d."
1202,CANTO VIII,"My gladness hides thee from me, which doth shine"
1203,CANTO VIII,"Around, and shroud me, as an animal"
1204,CANTO VIII,"In its own silk enswath’d. Thou lov’dst me well,"
1205,CANTO VIII,And had’st good cause; for had my sojourning
1206,CANTO VIII,"Been longer on the earth, the love I bare thee"
1207,CANTO VIII,"Had put forth more than blossoms. The left bank,"
1208,CANTO VIII,"That Rhone, when he hath mix’d with Sorga, laves."
1209,CANTO VIII,
1210,CANTO VIII,"“In me its lord expected, and that horn"
1211,CANTO VIII,"Of fair Ausonia, with its boroughs old,"
1212,CANTO VIII,"Bari, and Croton, and Gaeta pil’d,"
1213,CANTO VIII,"From where the Trento disembogues his waves,"
1214,CANTO VIII,"With Verde mingled, to the salt sea-flood."
1215,CANTO VIII,"Already on my temples beam’d the crown,"
1216,CANTO VIII,Which gave me sov’reignty over the land
1217,CANTO VIII,"By Danube wash’d, whenas he strays beyond"
1218,CANTO VIII,"The limits of his German shores. The realm,"
1219,CANTO VIII,"Where, on the gulf by stormy Eurus lash’d,"
1220,CANTO VIII,"Betwixt Pelorus and Pachynian heights,"
1221,CANTO VIII,The beautiful Trinacria lies in gloom
1222,CANTO VIII,"(Not through Typhaeus, but the vap’ry cloud"
1223,CANTO VIII,"Bituminous upsteam’d), THAT too did look"
1224,CANTO VIII,To have its scepter wielded by a race
1225,CANTO VIII,"Of monarchs, sprung through me from Charles and Rodolph;"
1226,CANTO VIII,had not ill lording which doth spirit up
1227,CANTO VIII,"The people ever, in Palermo rais’d"
1228,CANTO VIII,"The shout of ‘death,’ re-echo’d loud and long."
1229,CANTO VIII,"Had but my brother’s foresight kenn’d as much,"
1230,CANTO VIII,He had been warier that the greedy want
1231,CANTO VIII,Of Catalonia might not work his bale.
1232,CANTO VIII,"And truly need there is, that he forecast,"
1233,CANTO VIII,"Or other for him, lest more freight be laid"
1234,CANTO VIII,On his already over-laden bark.
1235,CANTO VIII,"Nature in him, from bounty fall’n to thrift,"
1236,CANTO VIII,"Would ask the guard of braver arms, than such"
1237,CANTO VIII,As only care to have their coffers fill’d.”
1238,CANTO VIII,
1239,CANTO VIII,"“My liege, it doth enhance the joy thy words"
1240,CANTO VIII,"Infuse into me, mighty as it is,"
1241,CANTO VIII,"To think my gladness manifest to thee,"
1242,CANTO VIII,"As to myself, who own it, when thou lookst"
1243,CANTO VIII,"Into the source and limit of all good,"
1244,CANTO VIII,"There, where thou markest that which thou dost speak,"
1245,CANTO VIII,Thence priz’d of me the more. Glad thou hast made me.
1246,CANTO VIII,"Now make intelligent, clearing the doubt"
1247,CANTO VIII,"Thy speech hath raised in me; for much I muse,"
1248,CANTO VIII,"How bitter can spring up, when sweet is sown.”"
1249,CANTO VIII,
1250,CANTO VIII,I thus inquiring; he forthwith replied:
1251,CANTO VIII,"“If I have power to show one truth, soon that"
1252,CANTO VIII,"Shall face thee, which thy questioning declares"
1253,CANTO VIII,"Behind thee now conceal’d. The Good, that guides"
1254,CANTO VIII,"And blessed makes this realm, which thou dost mount,"
1255,CANTO VIII,Ordains its providence to be the virtue
1256,CANTO VIII,In these great bodies: nor th’ all perfect Mind
1257,CANTO VIII,"Upholds their nature merely, but in them"
1258,CANTO VIII,"Their energy to save: for nought, that lies"
1259,CANTO VIII,"Within the range of that unerring bow,"
1260,CANTO VIII,"But is as level with the destin’d aim,"
1261,CANTO VIII,As ever mark to arrow’s point oppos’d.
1262,CANTO VIII,"Were it not thus, these heavens, thou dost visit,"
1263,CANTO VIII,"Would their effect so work, it would not be"
1264,CANTO VIII,"Art, but destruction; and this may not chance,"
1265,CANTO VIII,"If th’ intellectual powers, that move these stars,"
1266,CANTO VIII,"Fail not, or who, first faulty made them fail."
1267,CANTO VIII,Wilt thou this truth more clearly evidenc’d?”
1268,CANTO VIII,
1269,CANTO VIII,"To whom I thus: “It is enough: no fear,"
1270,CANTO VIII,"I see, lest nature in her part should tire.”"
1271,CANTO VIII,
1272,CANTO VIII,"He straight rejoin’d: “Say, were it worse for man,"
1273,CANTO VIII,If he liv’d not in fellowship on earth?”
1274,CANTO VIII,
1275,CANTO VIII,"“Yea,” answer’d I; “nor here a reason needs.”"
1276,CANTO VIII,
1277,CANTO VIII,"“And may that be, if different estates"
1278,CANTO VIII,Grow not of different duties in your life?
1279,CANTO VIII,"Consult your teacher, and he tells you ‘no.’”"
1280,CANTO VIII,
1281,CANTO VIII,"Thus did he come, deducing to this point,"
1282,CANTO VIII,"And then concluded: “For this cause behooves,"
1283,CANTO VIII,"The roots, from whence your operations come,"
1284,CANTO VIII,Must differ. Therefore one is Solon born;
1285,CANTO VIII,"Another, Xerxes; and Melchisidec"
1286,CANTO VIII,"A third; and he a fourth, whose airy voyage"
1287,CANTO VIII,"Cost him his son. In her circuitous course,"
1288,CANTO VIII,"Nature, that is the seal to mortal wax,"
1289,CANTO VIII,"Doth well her art, but no distinctions owns"
1290,CANTO VIII,’Twixt one or other household. Hence befalls
1291,CANTO VIII,That Esau is so wide of Jacob: hence
1292,CANTO VIII,"Quirinus of so base a father springs,"
1293,CANTO VIII,He dates from Mars his lineage. Were it not
1294,CANTO VIII,"That providence celestial overrul’d,"
1295,CANTO VIII,"Nature, in generation, must the path"
1296,CANTO VIII,"Trac’d by the generator, still pursue"
1297,CANTO VIII,Unswervingly. Thus place I in thy sight
1298,CANTO VIII,"That, which was late behind thee. But, in sign"
1299,CANTO VIII,"Of more affection for thee, ’tis my will"
1300,CANTO VIII,Thou wear this corollary. Nature ever
1301,CANTO VIII,"Finding discordant fortune, like all seed"
1302,CANTO VIII,"Out of its proper climate, thrives but ill."
1303,CANTO VIII,And were the world below content to mark
1304,CANTO VIII,"And work on the foundation nature lays,"
1305,CANTO VIII,It would not lack supply of excellence.
1306,CANTO VIII,But ye perversely to religion strain
1307,CANTO VIII,"Him, who was born to gird on him the sword,"
1308,CANTO VIII,And of the fluent phrasemen make your king;
1309,CANTO VIII,Therefore your steps have wander’d from the paths.”
1310,CANTO VIII,
1311,CANTO VIII,
1312,CANTO VIII,
1313,CANTO VIII,
1314,CANTO IX,CANTO IX
1315,CANTO IX,
1316,CANTO IX,
1317,CANTO IX,"After solution of my doubt, thy Charles,"
1318,CANTO IX,"O fair Clemenza, of the treachery spake"
1319,CANTO IX,"That must befall his seed: but, “Tell it not,”"
1320,CANTO IX,"Said he, “and let the destin’d years come round.”"
1321,CANTO IX,"Nor may I tell thee more, save that the meed"
1322,CANTO IX,Of sorrow well-deserv’d shall quit your wrongs.
1323,CANTO IX,
1324,CANTO IX,And now the visage of that saintly light
1325,CANTO IX,"Was to the sun, that fills it, turn’d again,"
1326,CANTO IX,"As to the good, whose plenitude of bliss"
1327,CANTO IX,Sufficeth all. O ye misguided souls!
1328,CANTO IX,"Infatuate, who from such a good estrange"
1329,CANTO IX,"Your hearts, and bend your gaze on vanity,"
1330,CANTO IX,"Alas for you!—And lo! toward me, next,"
1331,CANTO IX,"Another of those splendent forms approach’d,"
1332,CANTO IX,"That, by its outward bright’ning, testified"
1333,CANTO IX,The will it had to pleasure me. The eyes
1334,CANTO IX,"Of Beatrice, resting, as before,"
1335,CANTO IX,"Firmly upon me, manifested forth"
1336,CANTO IX,"Approval of my wish. “And O,” I cried,"
1337,CANTO IX,“Blest spirit! quickly be my will perform’d;
1338,CANTO IX,"And prove thou to me, that my inmost thoughts"
1339,CANTO IX,"I can reflect on thee.” Thereat the light,"
1340,CANTO IX,"That yet was new to me, from the recess,"
1341,CANTO IX,"Where it before was singing, thus began,"
1342,CANTO IX,As one who joys in kindness: “In that part
1343,CANTO IX,"Of the deprav’d Italian land, which lies"
1344,CANTO IX,"Between Rialto, and the fountain-springs"
1345,CANTO IX,"Of Brenta and of Piava, there doth rise,"
1346,CANTO IX,"But to no lofty eminence, a hill,"
1347,CANTO IX,"From whence erewhile a firebrand did descend,"
1348,CANTO IX,That sorely sheet the region. From one root
1349,CANTO IX,I and it sprang; my name on earth Cunizza:
1350,CANTO IX,"And here I glitter, for that by its light"
1351,CANTO IX,"This star o’ercame me. Yet I naught repine,"
1352,CANTO IX,"Nor grudge myself the cause of this my lot,"
1353,CANTO IX,Which haply vulgar hearts can scarce conceive.
1354,CANTO IX,
1355,CANTO IX,"“This jewel, that is next me in our heaven,"
1356,CANTO IX,"Lustrous and costly, great renown hath left,"
1357,CANTO IX,"And not to perish, ere these hundred years"
1358,CANTO IX,"Five times absolve their round. Consider thou,"
1359,CANTO IX,"If to excel be worthy man’s endeavour,"
1360,CANTO IX,When such life may attend the first. Yet they
1361,CANTO IX,"Care not for this, the crowd that now are girt"
1362,CANTO IX,"By Adice and Tagliamento, still"
1363,CANTO IX,"Impenitent, tho’ scourg’d. The hour is near,"
1364,CANTO IX,When for their stubbornness at Padua’s marsh
1365,CANTO IX,"The water shall be chang’d, that laves Vicena"
1366,CANTO IX,"And where Cagnano meets with Sile, one"
1367,CANTO IX,"Lords it, and bears his head aloft, for whom"
1368,CANTO IX,The web is now a-warping. Feltro too
1369,CANTO IX,"Shall sorrow for its godless shepherd’s fault,"
1370,CANTO IX,"Of so deep stain, that never, for the like,"
1371,CANTO IX,Was Malta’s bar unclos’d. Too large should be
1372,CANTO IX,"The skillet, that would hold Ferrara’s blood,"
1373,CANTO IX,"And wearied he, who ounce by ounce would weight it,"
1374,CANTO IX,"The which this priest, in show of party-zeal,"
1375,CANTO IX,Courteous will give; nor will the gift ill suit
1376,CANTO IX,"The country’s custom. We descry above,"
1377,CANTO IX,"Mirrors, ye call them thrones, from which to us"
1378,CANTO IX,Reflected shine the judgments of our God:
1379,CANTO IX,Whence these our sayings we avouch for good.”
1380,CANTO IX,
1381,CANTO IX,"She ended, and appear’d on other thoughts"
1382,CANTO IX,"Intent, re-ent’ring on the wheel she late"
1383,CANTO IX,Had left. That other joyance meanwhile wax’d
1384,CANTO IX,"A thing to marvel at, in splendour glowing,"
1385,CANTO IX,"Like choicest ruby stricken by the sun,"
1386,CANTO IX,"For, in that upper clime, effulgence comes"
1387,CANTO IX,"Of gladness, as here laughter: and below,"
1388,CANTO IX,"As the mind saddens, murkier grows the shade."
1389,CANTO IX,
1390,CANTO IX,"“God seeth all: and in him is thy sight,”"
1391,CANTO IX,"Said I, “blest Spirit! Therefore will of his"
1392,CANTO IX,Cannot to thee be dark. Why then delays
1393,CANTO IX,"Thy voice to satisfy my wish untold,"
1394,CANTO IX,"That voice which joins the inexpressive song,"
1395,CANTO IX,"Pastime of heav’n, the which those ardours sing,"
1396,CANTO IX,That cowl them with six shadowing wings outspread?
1397,CANTO IX,"I would not wait thy asking, wert thou known"
1398,CANTO IX,"To me, as thoroughly I to thee am known.”"
1399,CANTO IX,
1400,CANTO IX,"He forthwith answ’ring, thus his words began:"
1401,CANTO IX,"“The valley’ of waters, widest next to that"
1402,CANTO IX,"Which doth the earth engarland, shapes its course,"
1403,CANTO IX,"Between discordant shores, against the sun"
1404,CANTO IX,"Inward so far, it makes meridian there,"
1405,CANTO IX,Where was before th’ horizon. Of that vale
1406,CANTO IX,"Dwelt I upon the shore, ’twixt Ebro’s stream"
1407,CANTO IX,"And Macra’s, that divides with passage brief"
1408,CANTO IX,Genoan bounds from Tuscan. East and west
1409,CANTO IX,"Are nearly one to Begga and my land,"
1410,CANTO IX,Whose haven erst was with its own blood warm.
1411,CANTO IX,Who knew my name were wont to call me Folco:
1412,CANTO IX,"And I did bear impression of this heav’n,"
1413,CANTO IX,That now bears mine: for not with fiercer flame
1414,CANTO IX,"Glow’d Belus’ daughter, injuring alike"
1415,CANTO IX,"Sichaeus and Creusa, than did I,"
1416,CANTO IX,Long as it suited the unripen’d down
1417,CANTO IX,"That fledg’d my cheek: nor she of Rhodope,"
1418,CANTO IX,That was beguiled of Demophoon;
1419,CANTO IX,"Nor Jove’s son, when the charms of Iole"
1420,CANTO IX,Were shrin’d within his heart. And yet there hides
1421,CANTO IX,"No sorrowful repentance here, but mirth,"
1422,CANTO IX,"Not for the fault (that doth not come to mind),"
1423,CANTO IX,"But for the virtue, whose o’erruling sway"
1424,CANTO IX,And providence have wrought thus quaintly. Here
1425,CANTO IX,"The skill is look’d into, that fashioneth"
1426,CANTO IX,"With such effectual working, and the good"
1427,CANTO IX,"Discern’d, accruing to this upper world"
1428,CANTO IX,From that below. But fully to content
1429,CANTO IX,"Thy wishes, all that in this sphere have birth,"
1430,CANTO IX,"Demands my further parle. Inquire thou wouldst,"
1431,CANTO IX,"Who of this light is denizen, that here"
1432,CANTO IX,"Beside me sparkles, as the sun-beam doth"
1433,CANTO IX,"On the clear wave. Know then, the soul of Rahab"
1434,CANTO IX,"Is in that gladsome harbour, to our tribe"
1435,CANTO IX,"United, and the foremost rank assign’d."
1436,CANTO IX,"He to that heav’n, at which the shadow ends"
1437,CANTO IX,"Of your sublunar world, was taken up,"
1438,CANTO IX,"First, in Christ’s triumph, of all souls redeem’d:"
1439,CANTO IX,"For well behoov’d, that, in some part of heav’n,"
1440,CANTO IX,"She should remain a trophy, to declare"
1441,CANTO IX,The mighty contest won with either palm;
1442,CANTO IX,For that she favour’d first the high exploit
1443,CANTO IX,"Of Joshua on the holy land, whereof"
1444,CANTO IX,"The Pope recks little now. Thy city, plant"
1445,CANTO IX,"Of him, that on his Maker turn’d the back,"
1446,CANTO IX,"And of whose envying so much woe hath sprung,"
1447,CANTO IX,"Engenders and expands the cursed flower,"
1448,CANTO IX,"That hath made wander both the sheep and lambs,"
1449,CANTO IX,"Turning the shepherd to a wolf. For this,"
1450,CANTO IX,"The gospel and great teachers laid aside,"
1451,CANTO IX,"The decretals, as their stuft margins show,"
1452,CANTO IX,"Are the sole study. Pope and Cardinals,"
1453,CANTO IX,"Intent on these, ne’er journey but in thought"
1454,CANTO IX,"To Nazareth, where Gabriel op’d his wings."
1455,CANTO IX,"Yet it may chance, erelong, the Vatican,"
1456,CANTO IX,"And other most selected parts of Rome,"
1457,CANTO IX,"That were the grave of Peter’s soldiery,"
1458,CANTO IX,Shall be deliver’d from the adult’rous bond.”
1459,CANTO IX,
1460,CANTO IX,
1461,CANTO IX,
1462,CANTO IX,
1463,CANTO X,CANTO X
1464,CANTO X,
1465,CANTO X,
1466,CANTO X,"Looking into his first-born with the love,"
1467,CANTO X,"Which breathes from both eternal, the first Might"
1468,CANTO X,"Ineffable, whence eye or mind"
1469,CANTO X,"Can roam, hath in such order all dispos’d,"
1470,CANTO X,"As none may see and fail to enjoy. Raise, then,"
1471,CANTO X,"O reader! to the lofty wheels, with me,"
1472,CANTO X,"Thy ken directed to the point, whereat"
1473,CANTO X,One motion strikes on th’ other. There begin
1474,CANTO X,"Thy wonder of the mighty Architect,"
1475,CANTO X,"Who loves his work so inwardly, his eye"
1476,CANTO X,"Doth ever watch it. See, how thence oblique"
1477,CANTO X,"Brancheth the circle, where the planets roll"
1478,CANTO X,To pour their wished influence on the world;
1479,CANTO X,"Whose path not bending thus, in heav’n above"
1480,CANTO X,"Much virtue would be lost, and here on earth,"
1481,CANTO X,"All power well nigh extinct: or, from direct"
1482,CANTO X,"Were its departure distant more or less,"
1483,CANTO X,"I’ th’ universal order, great defect"
1484,CANTO X,"Must, both in heav’n and here beneath, ensue."
1485,CANTO X,
1486,CANTO X,"Now rest thee, reader! on thy bench, and muse"
1487,CANTO X,Anticipative of the feast to come;
1488,CANTO X,So shall delight make thee not feel thy toil.
1489,CANTO X,"Lo! I have set before thee, for thyself"
1490,CANTO X,"Feed now: the matter I indite, henceforth"
1491,CANTO X,"Demands entire my thought. Join’d with the part,"
1492,CANTO X,"Which late we told of, the great minister"
1493,CANTO X,"Of nature, that upon the world imprints"
1494,CANTO X,"The virtue of the heaven, and doles out"
1495,CANTO X,"Time for us with his beam, went circling on"
1496,CANTO X,"Along the spires, where each hour sooner comes;"
1497,CANTO X,"And I was with him, weetless of ascent,"
1498,CANTO X,"As one, who till arriv’d, weets not his coming."
1499,CANTO X,
1500,CANTO X,"For Beatrice, she who passeth on"
1501,CANTO X,"So suddenly from good to better, time"
1502,CANTO X,"Counts not the act, oh then how great must needs"
1503,CANTO X,Have been her brightness! What she was i’ th’ sun
1504,CANTO X,"(Where I had enter’d), not through change of hue,"
1505,CANTO X,But light transparent—did I summon up
1506,CANTO X,"Genius, art, practice—I might not so speak,"
1507,CANTO X,It should be e’er imagin’d: yet believ’d
1508,CANTO X,"It may be, and the sight be justly crav’d."
1509,CANTO X,"And if our fantasy fail of such height,"
1510,CANTO X,"What marvel, since no eye above the sun"
1511,CANTO X,"Hath ever travel’d? Such are they dwell here,"
1512,CANTO X,"Fourth family of the Omnipotent Sire,"
1513,CANTO X,Who of his spirit and of his offspring shows;
1514,CANTO X,And holds them still enraptur’d with the view.
1515,CANTO X,"And thus to me Beatrice: “Thank, oh thank,"
1516,CANTO X,"The Sun of angels, him, who by his grace"
1517,CANTO X,To this perceptible hath lifted thee.”
1518,CANTO X,
1519,CANTO X,"Never was heart in such devotion bound,"
1520,CANTO X,And with complacency so absolute
1521,CANTO X,"Dispos’d to render up itself to God,"
1522,CANTO X,As mine was at those words: and so entire
1523,CANTO X,"The love for Him, that held me, it eclips’d"
1524,CANTO X,Beatrice in oblivion. Naught displeas’d
1525,CANTO X,"Was she, but smil’d thereat so joyously,"
1526,CANTO X,That of her laughing eyes the radiance brake
1527,CANTO X,And scatter’d my collected mind abroad.
1528,CANTO X,
1529,CANTO X,"Then saw I a bright band, in liveliness"
1530,CANTO X,"Surpassing, who themselves did make the crown,"
1531,CANTO X,"And us their centre: yet more sweet in voice,"
1532,CANTO X,"Than in their visage beaming. Cinctur’d thus,"
1533,CANTO X,"Sometime Latona’s daughter we behold,"
1534,CANTO X,"When the impregnate air retains the thread,"
1535,CANTO X,"That weaves her zone. In the celestial court,"
1536,CANTO X,"Whence I return, are many jewels found,"
1537,CANTO X,"So dear and beautiful, they cannot brook"
1538,CANTO X,Transporting from that realm: and of these lights
1539,CANTO X,Such was the song. Who doth not prune his wing
1540,CANTO X,"To soar up thither, let him look from thence"
1541,CANTO X,"For tidings from the dumb. When, singing thus,"
1542,CANTO X,"Those burning suns that circled round us thrice,"
1543,CANTO X,"As nearest stars around the fixed pole,"
1544,CANTO X,"Then seem’d they like to ladies, from the dance"
1545,CANTO X,"Not ceasing, but suspense, in silent pause,"
1546,CANTO X,"List’ning, till they have caught the strain anew:"
1547,CANTO X,"Suspended so they stood: and, from within,"
1548,CANTO X,"Thus heard I one, who spake: “Since with its beam"
1549,CANTO X,"The grace, whence true love lighteth first his flame,"
1550,CANTO X,"That after doth increase by loving, shines"
1551,CANTO X,"So multiplied in thee, it leads thee up"
1552,CANTO X,"Along this ladder, down whose hallow’d steps"
1553,CANTO X,"None e’er descend, and mount them not again,"
1554,CANTO X,Who from his phial should refuse thee wine
1555,CANTO X,"To slake thy thirst, no less constrained were,"
1556,CANTO X,Than water flowing not unto the sea.
1557,CANTO X,"Thou fain wouldst hear, what plants are these, that bloom"
1558,CANTO X,"In the bright garland, which, admiring, girds"
1559,CANTO X,"This fair dame round, who strengthens thee for heav’n."
1560,CANTO X,"I then was of the lambs, that Dominic"
1561,CANTO X,"Leads, for his saintly flock, along the way,"
1562,CANTO X,"Where well they thrive, not sworn with vanity."
1563,CANTO X,"He, nearest on my right hand, brother was,"
1564,CANTO X,And master to me: Albert of Cologne
1565,CANTO X,"Is this: and of Aquinum, Thomas I."
1566,CANTO X,"If thou of all the rest wouldst be assur’d,"
1567,CANTO X,"Let thine eye, waiting on the words I speak,"
1568,CANTO X,In circuit journey round the blessed wreath.
1569,CANTO X,That next resplendence issues from the smile
1570,CANTO X,"Of Gratian, who to either forum lent"
1571,CANTO X,"Such help, as favour wins in Paradise."
1572,CANTO X,"The other, nearest, who adorns our quire,"
1573,CANTO X,"Was Peter, he that with the widow gave"
1574,CANTO X,"To holy church his treasure. The fifth light,"
1575,CANTO X,"Goodliest of all, is by such love inspired,"
1576,CANTO X,That all your world craves tidings of its doom:
1577,CANTO X,"Within, there is the lofty light, endow’d"
1578,CANTO X,"With sapience so profound, if truth be truth,"
1579,CANTO X,That with a ken of such wide amplitude
1580,CANTO X,No second hath arisen. Next behold
1581,CANTO X,"That taper’s radiance, to whose view was shown,"
1582,CANTO X,"Clearliest, the nature and the ministry"
1583,CANTO X,"Angelical, while yet in flesh it dwelt."
1584,CANTO X,In the other little light serenely smiles
1585,CANTO X,"That pleader for the Christian temples, he"
1586,CANTO X,Who did provide Augustin of his lore.
1587,CANTO X,"Now, if thy mind’s eye pass from light to light,"
1588,CANTO X,"Upon my praises following, of the eighth"
1589,CANTO X,"Thy thirst is next. The saintly soul, that shows"
1590,CANTO X,"The world’s deceitfulness, to all who hear him,"
1591,CANTO X,"Is, with the sight of all the good, that is,"
1592,CANTO X,"Blest there. The limbs, whence it was driven, lie"
1593,CANTO X,"Down in Cieldauro, and from martyrdom"
1594,CANTO X,"And exile came it here. Lo! further on,"
1595,CANTO X,"Where flames the arduous Spirit of Isidore,"
1596,CANTO X,"Of Bede, and Richard, more than man, erewhile,"
1597,CANTO X,"In deep discernment. Lastly this, from whom"
1598,CANTO X,"Thy look on me reverteth, was the beam"
1599,CANTO X,"Of one, whose spirit, on high musings bent,"
1600,CANTO X,Rebuk’d the ling’ring tardiness of death.
1601,CANTO X,"It is the eternal light of Sigebert,"
1602,CANTO X,"Who ’scap’d not envy, when of truth he argued,"
1603,CANTO X,"Reading in the straw-litter’d street.” Forthwith,"
1604,CANTO X,"As clock, that calleth up the spouse of God"
1605,CANTO X,"To win her bridegroom’s love at matin’s hour,"
1606,CANTO X,"Each part of other fitly drawn and urg’d,"
1607,CANTO X,"Sends out a tinkling sound, of note so sweet,"
1608,CANTO X,Affection springs in well-disposed breast;
1609,CANTO X,"Thus saw I move the glorious wheel, thus heard"
1610,CANTO X,"Voice answ’ring voice, so musical and soft,"
1611,CANTO X,It can be known but where day endless shines.

1622,CANTO XI,"For statues one, and one for aphorisms"
1623,CANTO XI,"Was hunting; this the priesthood follow’d, that"
1624,CANTO XI,By force or sophistry aspir’d to rule;
1625,CANTO XI,"To rob another, and another sought"
1626,CANTO XI,By civil business wealth; one moiling lay
1627,CANTO XI,"Tangled in net of sensual delight,"
1628,CANTO XI,And one to witless indolence resign’d;
1629,CANTO XI,"What time from all these empty things escap’d,"
1630,CANTO XI,"With Beatrice, I thus gloriously"
1631,CANTO XI,"Was rais’d aloft, and made the guest of heav’n."

1634,CANTO XI,"Where erst it was, had turn’d; and steady glow’d,"

1636,CANTO XI,"The lustre, that erewhile bespake me, smiling"
1637,CANTO XI,"With merer gladness, heard I thus begin:"
1638,CANTO XI,
1639,CANTO XI,"“E’en as his beam illumes me, so I look"
1640,CANTO XI,"Into the eternal light, and clearly mark"
1641,CANTO XI,"Thy thoughts, from whence they rise. Thou art in doubt,"
1642,CANTO XI,"And wouldst, that I should bolt my words afresh"
1643,CANTO XI,"In such plain open phrase, as may be smooth"
1644,CANTO XI,"To thy perception, where I told thee late"
1645,CANTO XI,That ‘well they thrive;’ and that ‘no second such
1646,CANTO XI,"Hath risen,’ which no small distinction needs."
1647,CANTO XI,
1648,CANTO XI,"“The providence, that governeth the world,"
1649,CANTO XI,In depth of counsel by created ken
1650,CANTO XI,"Unfathomable, to the end that she,"
1651,CANTO XI,"Who with loud cries was ‘spous’d in precious blood,"
1652,CANTO XI,"Might keep her footing towards her well-belov’d,"
1653,CANTO XI,"Safe in herself and constant unto him,"
1654,CANTO XI,"Hath two ordain’d, who should on either hand"
1655,CANTO XI,In chief escort her: one seraphic all
1656,CANTO XI,"In fervency; for wisdom upon earth,"
1657,CANTO XI,The other splendour of cherubic light.
1658,CANTO XI,"I but of one will tell: he tells of both,"
1659,CANTO XI,Who one commendeth which of them so’er

1662,CANTO XI,"“Between Tupino, and the wave, that falls"

1664,CANTO XI,"Rich slope of mountain high, whence heat and cold"
1665,CANTO XI,Are wafted through Perugia’s eastern gate:
1666,CANTO XI,"And Norcera with Gualdo, in its rear"
1667,CANTO XI,"Mourn for their heavy yoke. Upon that side,"
1668,CANTO XI,"Where it doth break its steepness most, arose"
1669,CANTO XI,"A sun upon the world, as duly this"
1670,CANTO XI,"From Ganges doth: therefore let none, who speak"
1671,CANTO XI,"Of that place, say Ascesi; for its name"

1674,CANTO XI,"He was not yet much distant from his rising,"
1675,CANTO XI,When his good influence ’gan to bless the earth.
1676,CANTO XI,A dame to whom none openeth pleasure’s gate
1677,CANTO XI,"More than to death, was, ’gainst his father’s will,"
1678,CANTO XI,"His stripling choice: and he did make her his,"
1679,CANTO XI,"Before the Spiritual court, by nuptial bonds,"
1680,CANTO XI,"And in his father’s sight: from day to day,"
1681,CANTO XI,"Then lov’d her more devoutly. She, bereav’d"
1682,CANTO XI,"Of her first husband, slighted and obscure,"
1683,CANTO XI,"Thousand and hundred years and more, remain’d"
1684,CANTO XI,"Without a single suitor, till he came."
1685,CANTO XI,"Nor aught avail’d, that, with Amyclas, she"
1686,CANTO XI,"Was found unmov’d at rumour of his voice,"
1687,CANTO XI,Who shook the world: nor aught her constant boldness
1688,CANTO XI,"Whereby with Christ she mounted on the cross,"
1689,CANTO XI,When Mary stay’d beneath. But not to deal
1690,CANTO XI,"Thus closely with thee longer, take at large"
1691,CANTO XI,The rovers’ titles—Poverty and Francis.
1692,CANTO XI,"Their concord and glad looks, wonder and love,"
1693,CANTO XI,"And sweet regard gave birth to holy thoughts,"
1694,CANTO XI,"So much, that venerable Bernard first"
1695,CANTO XI,"Did bare his feet, and, in pursuit of peace"
1696,CANTO XI,"So heavenly, ran, yet deem’d his footing slow."
1697,CANTO XI,O hidden riches! O prolific good!
1698,CANTO XI,"Egidius bares him next, and next Sylvester,"
1699,CANTO XI,And follow both the bridegroom; so the bride
1700,CANTO XI,"Can please them. Thenceforth goes he on his way,"
1701,CANTO XI,"The father and the master, with his spouse,"
1702,CANTO XI,"And with that family, whom now the cord"
1703,CANTO XI,Girt humbly: nor did abjectness of heart
1704,CANTO XI,"Weigh down his eyelids, for that he was son"
1705,CANTO XI,"Of Pietro Bernardone, and by men"
1706,CANTO XI,In wond’rous sort despis’d. But royally
1707,CANTO XI,His hard intention he to Innocent
1708,CANTO XI,"Set forth, and from him first receiv’d the seal"
1709,CANTO XI,"On his religion. Then, when numerous flock’d"
1710,CANTO XI,"The tribe of lowly ones, that trac’d HIS steps,"
1711,CANTO XI,Whose marvellous life deservedly were sung
1712,CANTO XI,"In heights empyreal, through Honorius’ hand"
1713,CANTO XI,"A second crown, to deck their Guardian’s virtues,"
1714,CANTO XI,Was by the eternal Spirit inwreath’d: and when
1715,CANTO XI,"He had, through thirst of martyrdom, stood up"
1716,CANTO XI,"In the proud Soldan’s presence, and there preach’d"
1717,CANTO XI,Christ and his followers; but found the race
1718,CANTO XI,Unripen’d for conversion: back once more
1719,CANTO XI,"He hasted (not to intermit his toil),"
1720,CANTO XI,"And reap’d Ausonian lands. On the hard rock,"
1721,CANTO XI,"’Twixt Arno and the Tyber, he from Christ"
1722,CANTO XI,"Took the last Signet, which his limbs two years"
1723,CANTO XI,"Did carry. Then the season come, that he,"
1724,CANTO XI,"Who to such good had destin’d him, was pleas’d"
1725,CANTO XI,"T’ advance him to the meed, which he had earn’d"
1726,CANTO XI,"By his self-humbling, to his brotherhood,"
1727,CANTO XI,"As their just heritage, he gave in charge"
1728,CANTO XI,"His dearest lady, and enjoin’d their love"
1729,CANTO XI,"And faith to her: and, from her bosom, will’d"
1730,CANTO XI,"His goodly spirit should move forth, returning"
1731,CANTO XI,"To its appointed kingdom, nor would have"
1732,CANTO XI,His body laid upon another bier.

1734,CANTO XI,"“Think now of one, who were a fit colleague,"
1735,CANTO XI,To keep the bark of Peter in deep sea

1737,CANTO XI,"Therefore who follow him, as he enjoins,"
1738,CANTO XI,"Thou mayst be certain, take good lading in."
1739,CANTO XI,"But hunger of new viands tempts his flock,"
1740,CANTO XI,So that they needs into strange pastures wide
1741,CANTO XI,Must spread them: and the more remote from him
1742,CANTO XI,"The stragglers wander, so much mole they come"
1743,CANTO XI,"Home to the sheep-fold, destitute of milk."
1744,CANTO XI,"There are of them, in truth, who fear their harm,"

1791,CANTO XII,"Such good of mine is spoken. Where one is,"
1792,CANTO XII,The other worthily should also be;
1793,CANTO XII,"That as their warfare was alike, alike"
1794,CANTO XII,"Should be their glory. Slow, and full of doubt,"
1795,CANTO XII,"And with thin ranks, after its banner mov’d"
1796,CANTO XII,The army of Christ (which it so clearly cost
1797,CANTO XII,"To reappoint), when its imperial Head,"
1798,CANTO XII,"Who reigneth ever, for the drooping host"
1799,CANTO XII,"Did make provision, thorough grace alone,"

1804,CANTO XII,Where springs the pleasant west-wind to unfold
1805,CANTO XII,"The fresh leaves, with which Europe sees herself"

1809,CANTO XII,"The happy Callaroga, under guard"

1826,CANTO XII,"And I speak of him, as the labourer,"
1827,CANTO XII,Whom Christ in his own garden chose to be
1828,CANTO XII,"His help-mate. Messenger he seem’d, and friend"
1829,CANTO XII,"Fast-knit to Christ; and the first love he show’d,"
1830,CANTO XII,Was after the first counsel that Christ gave.
1831,CANTO XII,"Many a time his nurse, at entering found"

1843,CANTO XII,And from the see (whose bounty to the just

1850,CANTO XII,"Licence to fight, in favour of that seed,"
1851,CANTO XII,From which the twice twelve cions gird thee round.
1852,CANTO XII,"Then, with sage doctrine and good will to help,"
1853,CANTO XII,"Forth on his great apostleship he far’d,"
1854,CANTO XII,Like torrent bursting from a lofty vein;
1855,CANTO XII,"And, dashing ’gainst the stocks of heresy,"
1856,CANTO XII,"Smote fiercest, where resistance was most stout."
1857,CANTO XII,"Thence many rivulets have since been turn’d,"
1858,CANTO XII,Over the garden Catholic to lead
1859,CANTO XII,"Their living waters, and have fed its plants."

1864,CANTO XII,"Thou canst not doubt its fellow’s excellence,"
1865,CANTO XII,"Which Thomas, ere my coming, hath declar’d"
1866,CANTO XII,"So courteously unto thee. But the track,"

1869,CANTO XII,"His family, that wont to trace his path,"
1870,CANTO XII,"Turn backward, and invert their steps; erelong"
1871,CANTO XII,"To rue the gathering in of their ill crop,"
1872,CANTO XII,When the rejected tares in vain shall ask
1873,CANTO XII,Admittance to the barn. I question not
1874,CANTO XII,"But he, who search’d our volume, leaf by leaf,"
1875,CANTO XII,"Might still find page with this inscription on’t,"
1876,CANTO XII,‘I am as I was wont.’ Yet such were not

1913,CANTO XIII,With the bright summit of that horn which swells
1914,CANTO XIII,"Due from the pole, round which the first wheel rolls,"

1917,CANTO XIII,When death’s chill seized her; and that one of them

1937,CANTO XIII,"And its grain safely stor’d, sweet charity"
1938,CANTO XIII,Invites me with the other to like toil.
1939,CANTO XIII,
1940,CANTO XIII,"“Thou know’st, that in the bosom, whence the rib"
1941,CANTO XIII,"Was ta’en to fashion that fair cheek, whose taste"
1942,CANTO XIII,"All the world pays for, and in that, which pierc’d"
1943,CANTO XIII,"By the keen lance, both after and before"
1944,CANTO XIII,"Such satisfaction offer’d, as outweighs"
1945,CANTO XIII,"Each evil in the scale, whate’er of light"
1946,CANTO XIII,"To human nature is allow’d, must all"
1947,CANTO XIII,"Have by his virtue been infus’d, who form’d"
1948,CANTO XIII,Both one and other: and thou thence admir’st
1949,CANTO XIII,"In that I told thee, of beatitudes"
1950,CANTO XIII,"A second, there is none, to his enclos’d"
1951,CANTO XIII,In the fifth radiance. Open now thine eyes
1952,CANTO XIII,To what I answer thee; and thou shalt see
1953,CANTO XIII,"Thy deeming and my saying meet in truth,"
1954,CANTO XIII,"As centre in the round. That which dies not,"
1955,CANTO XIII,"And that which can die, are but each the beam"
1956,CANTO XIII,"Of that idea, which our Soverign Sire"
1957,CANTO XIII,"Engendereth loving; for that lively light,"
1958,CANTO XIII,Which passeth from his brightness; not disjoin’d
1959,CANTO XIII,"From him, nor from his love triune with them,"
1960,CANTO XIII,"Doth, through his bounty, congregate itself,"
1961,CANTO XIII,"Mirror’d, as ’twere in new existences,"
1962,CANTO XIII,Itself unalterable and ever one.
1963,CANTO XIII,
1964,CANTO XIII,"“Descending hence unto the lowest powers,"
1965,CANTO XIII,"Its energy so sinks, at last it makes"
1966,CANTO XIII,But brief contingencies: for so I name
1967,CANTO XIII,"Things generated, which the heav’nly orbs"
1968,CANTO XIII,"Moving, with seed or without seed, produce."
1969,CANTO XIII,"Their wax, and that which molds it, differ much:"
1970,CANTO XIII,"And thence with lustre, more or less, it shows"
1971,CANTO XIII,Th’ ideal stamp impress: so that one tree
1972,CANTO XIII,"According to his kind, hath better fruit,"
1973,CANTO XIII,"And worse: and, at your birth, ye, mortal men,"
1974,CANTO XIII,Are in your talents various. Were the wax
1975,CANTO XIII,"Molded with nice exactness, and the heav’n"
1976,CANTO XIII,"In its disposing influence supreme,"
1977,CANTO XIII,The lustre of the seal should be complete:
1978,CANTO XIII,"But nature renders it imperfect ever,"
1979,CANTO XIII,"Resembling thus the artist in her work,"
1980,CANTO XIII,Whose faultering hand is faithless to his skill.
1981,CANTO XIII,"Howe’er, if love itself dispose, and mark"
1982,CANTO XIII,"The primal virtue, kindling with bright view,"
1983,CANTO XIII,There all perfection is vouchsafed; and such
1984,CANTO XIII,"The clay was made, accomplish’d with each gift,"
1985,CANTO XIII,That life can teem with; such the burden fill’d
1986,CANTO XIII,The virgin’s bosom: so that I commend
1987,CANTO XIII,"Thy judgment, that the human nature ne’er"
1988,CANTO XIII,"Was or can be, such as in them it was."
1989,CANTO XIII,
1990,CANTO XIII,"“Did I advance no further than this point,"
1991,CANTO XIII,‘How then had he no peer?’ thou might’st reply.
1992,CANTO XIII,"But, that what now appears not, may appear"
1993,CANTO XIII,"Right plainly, ponder, who he was, and what"
1994,CANTO XIII,"(When he was bidden ‘Ask’), the motive sway’d"
1995,CANTO XIII,"To his requesting. I have spoken thus,"
1996,CANTO XIII,"That thou mayst see, he was a king, who ask’d"
1997,CANTO XIII,"For wisdom, to the end he might be king"
1998,CANTO XIII,Sufficient: not the number to search out
1999,CANTO XIII,"Of the celestial movers; or to know,"
2000,CANTO XIII,If necessary with contingent e’er
2001,CANTO XIII,Have made necessity; or whether that
2002,CANTO XIII,"Be granted, that first motion is; or if"
2003,CANTO XIII,"Of the mid circle can, by art, be made"
2004,CANTO XIII,"Triangle with each corner, blunt or sharp."
2005,CANTO XIII,
2006,CANTO XIII,"“Whence, noting that, which I have said, and this,"
2007,CANTO XIII,"Thou kingly prudence and that ken mayst learn,"
2008,CANTO XIII,At which the dart of my intention aims.
2009,CANTO XIII,"And, marking clearly, that I told thee, ‘Risen,’"
2010,CANTO XIII,Thou shalt discern it only hath respect
2011,CANTO XIII,"To kings, of whom are many, and the good"
2012,CANTO XIII,Are rare. With this distinction take my words;
2013,CANTO XIII,And they may well consist with that which thou
2014,CANTO XIII,"Of the first human father dost believe,"
2015,CANTO XIII,And of our well-beloved. And let this
2016,CANTO XIII,"Henceforth be led unto thy feet, to make"
2017,CANTO XIII,"Thee slow in motion, as a weary man,"
2018,CANTO XIII,Both to the ‘yea’ and to the ‘nay’ thou seest not.
2019,CANTO XIII,"For he among the fools is down full low,"
2020,CANTO XIII,"Whose affirmation, or denial, is"
2021,CANTO XIII,"Without distinction, in each case alike"
2022,CANTO XIII,"Since it befalls, that in most instances"
2023,CANTO XIII,Current opinion leads to false: and then
2024,CANTO XIII,Affection bends the judgment to her ply.
2025,CANTO XIII,
2026,CANTO XIII,"“Much more than vainly doth he loose from shore,"
2027,CANTO XIII,"Since he returns not such as he set forth,"
2028,CANTO XIII,Who fishes for the truth and wanteth skill.
2029,CANTO XIII,And open proofs of this unto the world
2030,CANTO XIII,"Have been afforded in Parmenides,"
2031,CANTO XIII,"Melissus, Bryso, and the crowd beside,"
2032,CANTO XIII,"Who journey’d on, and knew not whither: so did"
2033,CANTO XIII,"Sabellius, Arius, and the other fools,"
2034,CANTO XIII,"Who, like to scymitars, reflected back"
2035,CANTO XIII,"The scripture-image, by distortion marr’d."
2036,CANTO XIII,
2037,CANTO XIII,"“Let not the people be too swift to judge,"
2038,CANTO XIII,"As one who reckons on the blades in field,"
2039,CANTO XIII,Or ere the crop be ripe. For I have seen
2040,CANTO XIII,The thorn frown rudely all the winter long
2041,CANTO XIII,And after bear the rose upon its top;
2042,CANTO XIII,"And bark, that all the way across the sea"
2043,CANTO XIII,"Ran straight and speedy, perish at the last,"
2044,CANTO XIII,"E’en in the haven’s mouth seeing one steal,"
2045,CANTO XIII,"Another brine, his offering to the priest,"
2046,CANTO XIII,Let not Dame Birtha and Sir Martin thence
2047,CANTO XIII,Into heav’n’s counsels deem that they can pry:
2048,CANTO XIII,"For one of these may rise, the other fall.”"
2049,CANTO XIII,
2050,CANTO XIII,
2051,CANTO XIII,
2052,CANTO XIII,
2053,CANTO XIV,CANTO XIV
2054,CANTO XIV,
2055,CANTO XIV,
2056,CANTO XIV,"From centre to the circle, and so back"
2057,CANTO XIV,"From circle to the centre, water moves"
2058,CANTO XIV,"In the round chalice, even as the blow"
2059,CANTO XIV,"Impels it, inwardly, or from without."
2060,CANTO XIV,"Such was the image glanc’d into my mind,"
2061,CANTO XIV,As the great spirit of Aquinum ceas’d;
2062,CANTO XIV,And Beatrice after him her words
2063,CANTO XIV,Resum’d alternate: “Need there is (tho’ yet
2064,CANTO XIV,"He tells it to you not in words, nor e’en"
2065,CANTO XIV,In thought) that he should fathom to its depth
2066,CANTO XIV,"Another mystery. Tell him, if the light,"
2067,CANTO XIV,"Wherewith your substance blooms, shall stay with you"
2068,CANTO XIV,"Eternally, as now: and, if it doth,"
2069,CANTO XIV,"How, when ye shall regain your visible forms,"
2070,CANTO XIV,"The sight may without harm endure the change,"
2071,CANTO XIV,"That also tell.” As those, who in a ring"
2072,CANTO XIV,"Tread the light measure, in their fitful mirth"
2073,CANTO XIV,"Raise loud the voice, and spring with gladder bound;"
2074,CANTO XIV,"Thus, at the hearing of that pious suit,"
2075,CANTO XIV,The saintly circles in their tourneying
2076,CANTO XIV,And wond’rous note attested new delight.
2077,CANTO XIV,
2078,CANTO XIV,"Whoso laments, that we must doff this garb"
2079,CANTO XIV,"Of frail mortality, thenceforth to live"
2080,CANTO XIV,"Immortally above, he hath not seen"
2081,CANTO XIV,"The sweet refreshing, of that heav’nly shower."
2082,CANTO XIV,
2083,CANTO XIV,"Him, who lives ever, and for ever reigns"
2084,CANTO XIV,"In mystic union of the Three in One,"
2085,CANTO XIV,"Unbounded, bounding all, each spirit thrice"
2086,CANTO XIV,"Sang, with such melody, as but to hear"
2087,CANTO XIV,For highest merit were an ample meed.
2088,CANTO XIV,"And from the lesser orb the goodliest light,"
2089,CANTO XIV,"With gentle voice and mild, such as perhaps"
2090,CANTO XIV,"The angel’s once to Mary, thus replied:"
2091,CANTO XIV,"“Long as the joy of Paradise shall last,"
2092,CANTO XIV,"Our love shall shine around that raiment, bright,"
2093,CANTO XIV,"As fervent; fervent, as in vision blest;"
2094,CANTO XIV,"And that as far in blessedness exceeding,"
2095,CANTO XIV,As it hath grave beyond its virtue great.
2096,CANTO XIV,"Our shape, regarmented with glorious weeds"
2097,CANTO XIV,"Of saintly flesh, must, being thus entire,"
2098,CANTO XIV,"Show yet more gracious. Therefore shall increase,"
2099,CANTO XIV,"Whate’er of light, gratuitous, imparts"
2100,CANTO XIV,"The Supreme Good; light, ministering aid,"
2101,CANTO XIV,The better disclose his glory: whence
2102,CANTO XIV,"The vision needs increasing, much increase"
2103,CANTO XIV,"The fervour, which it kindles; and that too"
2104,CANTO XIV,"The ray, that comes from it. But as the greed"
2105,CANTO XIV,"Which gives out flame, yet it its whiteness shines"
2106,CANTO XIV,"More lively than that, and so preserves"
2107,CANTO XIV,Its proper semblance; thus this circling sphere
2108,CANTO XIV,"Of splendour, shall to view less radiant seem,"
2109,CANTO XIV,"Than shall our fleshly robe, which yonder earth"
2110,CANTO XIV,Now covers. Nor will such excess of light
2111,CANTO XIV,"O’erpower us, in corporeal organs made"
2112,CANTO XIV,"Firm, and susceptible of all delight.”"
2113,CANTO XIV,
2114,CANTO XIV,"So ready and so cordial an “Amen,”"
2115,CANTO XIV,"Followed from either choir, as plainly spoke"
2116,CANTO XIV,Desire of their dead bodies; yet perchance
2117,CANTO XIV,"Not for themselves, but for their kindred dear,"
2118,CANTO XIV,"Mothers and sires, and those whom best they lov’d,"
2119,CANTO XIV,Ere they were made imperishable flame.
2120,CANTO XIV,
2121,CANTO XIV,And lo! forthwith there rose up round about
2122,CANTO XIV,"A lustre over that already there,"
2123,CANTO XIV,"Of equal clearness, like the brightening up"
2124,CANTO XIV,Of the horizon. As at an evening hour
2125,CANTO XIV,"Of twilight, new appearances through heav’n"
2126,CANTO XIV,"Peer with faint glimmer, doubtfully descried;"
2127,CANTO XIV,"So there new substances, methought began"
2128,CANTO XIV,To rise in view; and round the other twain
2129,CANTO XIV,"Enwheeling, sweep their ampler circuit wide."
2130,CANTO XIV,
2131,CANTO XIV,O gentle glitter of eternal beam!
2132,CANTO XIV,"With what a such whiteness did it flow,"
2133,CANTO XIV,"O’erpowering vision in me! But so fair,"
2134,CANTO XIV,"So passing lovely, Beatrice show’d,"
2135,CANTO XIV,"Mind cannot follow it, nor words express"
2136,CANTO XIV,Her infinite sweetness. Thence mine eyes regain’d
2137,CANTO XIV,"Power to look up, and I beheld myself,"
2138,CANTO XIV,"Sole with my lady, to more lofty bliss"
2139,CANTO XIV,"Translated: for the star, with warmer smile"
2140,CANTO XIV,"Impurpled, well denoted our ascent."
2141,CANTO XIV,
2142,CANTO XIV,"With all the heart, and with that tongue which speaks"
2143,CANTO XIV,"The same in all, an holocaust I made"
2144,CANTO XIV,"To God, befitting the new grace vouchsaf’d."
2145,CANTO XIV,And from my bosom had not yet upsteam’d
2146,CANTO XIV,"The fuming of that incense, when I knew"
2147,CANTO XIV,The rite accepted. With such mighty sheen
2148,CANTO XIV,"And mantling crimson, in two listed rays"
2149,CANTO XIV,"The splendours shot before me, that I cried,"
2150,CANTO XIV,“God of Sabaoth! that does prank them thus!”
2151,CANTO XIV,
2152,CANTO XIV,"As leads the galaxy from pole to pole,"
2153,CANTO XIV,"Distinguish’d into greater lights and less,"
2154,CANTO XIV,"Its pathway, which the wisest fail to spell;"
2155,CANTO XIV,"So thickly studded, in the depth of Mars,"
2156,CANTO XIV,"Those rays describ’d the venerable sign,"
2157,CANTO XIV,That quadrants in the round conjoining frame.
2158,CANTO XIV,Here memory mocks the toil of genius. Christ
2159,CANTO XIV,Beam’d on that cross; and pattern fails me now.
2160,CANTO XIV,"But whoso takes his cross, and follows Christ"
2161,CANTO XIV,"Will pardon me for that I leave untold,"
2162,CANTO XIV,When in the flecker’d dawning he shall spy
2163,CANTO XIV,"The glitterance of Christ. From horn to horn,"
2164,CANTO XIV,And ’tween the summit and the base did move
2165,CANTO XIV,"Lights, scintillating, as they met and pass’d."
2166,CANTO XIV,"Thus oft are seen, with ever-changeful glance,"
2167,CANTO XIV,"Straight or athwart, now rapid and now slow,"
2168,CANTO XIV,"The atomies of bodies, long or short,"
2169,CANTO XIV,"To move along the sunbeam, whose slant line"
2170,CANTO XIV,"Checkers the shadow, interpos’d by art"
2171,CANTO XIV,Against the noontide heat. And as the chime
2172,CANTO XIV,"Of minstrel music, dulcimer, and help"
2173,CANTO XIV,"With many strings, a pleasant dining makes"
2174,CANTO XIV,"To him, who heareth not distinct the note;"
2175,CANTO XIV,"So from the lights, which there appear’d to me,"
2176,CANTO XIV,"Gather’d along the cross a melody,"
2177,CANTO XIV,"That, indistinctly heard, with ravishment"
2178,CANTO XIV,Possess’d me. Yet I mark’d it was a hymn
2179,CANTO XIV,Of lofty praises; for there came to me
2180,CANTO XIV,"“Arise and conquer,” as to one who hears"
2181,CANTO XIV,And comprehends not. Me such ecstasy
2182,CANTO XIV,"O’ercame, that never till that hour was thing"
2183,CANTO XIV,That held me in so sweet imprisonment.
2184,CANTO XIV,
2185,CANTO XIV,"Perhaps my saying over bold appears,"
2186,CANTO XIV,"Accounting less the pleasure of those eyes,"
2187,CANTO XIV,Whereon to look fulfilleth all desire.
2188,CANTO XIV,"But he, who is aware those living seals"
2189,CANTO XIV,"Of every beauty work with quicker force,"
2190,CANTO XIV,The higher they are ris’n; and that there
2191,CANTO XIV,I had not turn’d me to them; he may well
2192,CANTO XIV,"Excuse me that, whereof in my excuse"
2193,CANTO XIV,"I do accuse me, and may own my truth;"
2194,CANTO XIV,"That holy pleasure here not yet reveal’d,"
2195,CANTO XIV,Which grows in transport as we mount aloof.
2196,CANTO XIV,
2197,CANTO XIV,
2198,CANTO XIV,
2199,CANTO XIV,
2200,CANTO XV,CANTO XV
2201,CANTO XV,
2202,CANTO XV,
2203,CANTO XV,"True love, that ever shows itself as clear"
2204,CANTO XV,"In kindness, as loose appetite in wrong,"
2205,CANTO XV,"Silenced that lyre harmonious, and still’d"
2206,CANTO XV,"The sacred chords, that are by heav’n’s right hand"
2207,CANTO XV,"Unwound and tighten’d, flow to righteous prayers"
2208,CANTO XV,"Should they not hearken, who, to give me will"
2209,CANTO XV,"For praying, in accordance thus were mute?"
2210,CANTO XV,"He hath in sooth good cause for endless grief,"
2211,CANTO XV,"Who, for the love of thing that lasteth not,"
2212,CANTO XV,Despoils himself forever of that love.
2213,CANTO XV,
2214,CANTO XV,"As oft along the still and pure serene,"
2215,CANTO XV,"At nightfall, glides a sudden trail of fire,"
2216,CANTO XV,Attracting with involuntary heed
2217,CANTO XV,"The eye to follow it, erewhile at rest,"
2218,CANTO XV,"And seems some star that shifted place in heav’n,"
2219,CANTO XV,"Only that, whence it kindles, none is lost,"
2220,CANTO XV,"And it is soon extinct; thus from the horn,"
2221,CANTO XV,"That on the dexter of the cross extends,"
2222,CANTO XV,"Down to its foot, one luminary ran"
2223,CANTO XV,From mid the cluster shone there; yet no gem
2224,CANTO XV,Dropp’d from its foil; and through the beamy list
2225,CANTO XV,"Like flame in alabaster, glow’d its course."
2226,CANTO XV,
2227,CANTO XV,So forward stretch’d him (if of credence aught
2228,CANTO XV,Our greater muse may claim) the pious ghost
2229,CANTO XV,"Of old Anchises, in the’ Elysian bower,"
2230,CANTO XV,"When he perceiv’d his son. “O thou, my blood!"
2231,CANTO XV,"O most exceeding grace divine! to whom,"
2232,CANTO XV,"As now to thee, hath twice the heav’nly gate"
2233,CANTO XV,Been e’er unclos’d?” so spake the light; whence I
2234,CANTO XV,Turn’d me toward him; then unto my dame
2235,CANTO XV,"My sight directed, and on either side"
2236,CANTO XV,Amazement waited me; for in her eyes
2237,CANTO XV,"Was lighted such a smile, I thought that mine"
2238,CANTO XV,Had div’d unto the bottom of my grace
2239,CANTO XV,And of my bliss in Paradise. Forthwith
2240,CANTO XV,"To hearing and to sight grateful alike,"
2241,CANTO XV,The spirit to his proem added things
2242,CANTO XV,"I understood not, so profound he spake;"
2243,CANTO XV,Yet not of choice but through necessity
2244,CANTO XV,Mysterious; for his high conception scar’d
2245,CANTO XV,Beyond the mark of mortals. When the flight
2246,CANTO XV,"Of holy transport had so spent its rage,"
2247,CANTO XV,That nearer to the level of our thought
2248,CANTO XV,"The speech descended, the first sounds I heard"
2249,CANTO XV,"Were, “Best he thou, Triunal Deity!"
2250,CANTO XV,That hast such favour in my seed vouchsaf’d!”
2251,CANTO XV,"Then follow’d: “No unpleasant thirst, tho’ long,"
2252,CANTO XV,"Which took me reading in the sacred book,"
2253,CANTO XV,"Whose leaves or white or dusky never change,"
2254,CANTO XV,"Thou hast allay’d, my son, within this light,"
2255,CANTO XV,From whence my voice thou hear’st; more thanks to her.
2256,CANTO XV,Who for such lofty mounting has with plumes
2257,CANTO XV,Begirt thee. Thou dost deem thy thoughts to me
2258,CANTO XV,"From him transmitted, who is first of all,"
2259,CANTO XV,E’en as all numbers ray from unity;
2260,CANTO XV,"And therefore dost not ask me who I am,"
2261,CANTO XV,"Or why to thee more joyous I appear,"
2262,CANTO XV,Than any other in this gladsome throng.
2263,CANTO XV,The truth is as thou deem’st; for in this hue
2264,CANTO XV,"Both less and greater in that mirror look,"
2265,CANTO XV,"In which thy thoughts, or ere thou think’st, are shown."
2266,CANTO XV,"But, that the love, which keeps me wakeful ever,"
2267,CANTO XV,"Urging with sacred thirst of sweet desire,"
2268,CANTO XV,"May be contended fully, let thy voice,"
2269,CANTO XV,"Fearless, and frank and jocund, utter forth"
2270,CANTO XV,"Thy will distinctly, utter forth the wish,"
2271,CANTO XV,Whereto my ready answer stands decreed.”
2272,CANTO XV,
2273,CANTO XV,I turn’d me to Beatrice; and she heard
2274,CANTO XV,"Ere I had spoken, smiling, an assent,"
2275,CANTO XV,That to my will gave wings; and I began
2276,CANTO XV,"“To each among your tribe, what time ye kenn’d"
2277,CANTO XV,"The nature, in whom naught unequal dwells,"
2278,CANTO XV,Wisdom and love were in one measure dealt;
2279,CANTO XV,"For that they are so equal in the sun,"
2280,CANTO XV,"From whence ye drew your radiance and your heat,"
2281,CANTO XV,"As makes all likeness scant. But will and means,"
2282,CANTO XV,"In mortals, for the cause ye well discern,"
2283,CANTO XV,With unlike wings are fledge. A mortal I
2284,CANTO XV,"Experience inequality like this,"
2285,CANTO XV,"And therefore give no thanks, but in the heart,"
2286,CANTO XV,For thy paternal greeting. This howe’er
2287,CANTO XV,"I pray thee, living topaz! that ingemm’st"
2288,CANTO XV,"This precious jewel, let me hear thy name.”"
2289,CANTO XV,
2290,CANTO XV,"“I am thy root, O leaf! whom to expect"
2291,CANTO XV,"Even, hath pleas’d me:” thus the prompt reply"
2292,CANTO XV,"Prefacing, next it added; “he, of whom"
2293,CANTO XV,"Thy kindred appellation comes, and who,"
2294,CANTO XV,"These hundred years and more, on its first ledge"
2295,CANTO XV,"Hath circuited the mountain, was my son"
2296,CANTO XV,"And thy great grandsire. Well befits, his long"
2297,CANTO XV,Endurance should be shorten’d by thy deeds.
2298,CANTO XV,
2299,CANTO XV,"“Florence, within her ancient limit-mark,"
2300,CANTO XV,"Which calls her still to matin prayers and noon,"
2301,CANTO XV,"Was chaste and sober, and abode in peace."
2302,CANTO XV,"She had no armlets and no head-tires then,"
2303,CANTO XV,"No purfled dames, no zone, that caught the eye"
2304,CANTO XV,"More than the person did. Time was not yet,"
2305,CANTO XV,When at his daughter’s birth the sire grew pale.
2306,CANTO XV,For fear the age and dowry should exceed
2307,CANTO XV,On each side just proportion. House was none
2308,CANTO XV,Void of its family; nor yet had come
2309,CANTO XV,"Hardanapalus, to exhibit feats"
2310,CANTO XV,Of chamber prowess. Montemalo yet
2311,CANTO XV,O’er our suburban turret rose; as much
2312,CANTO XV,"To be surpass in fall, as in its rising."
2313,CANTO XV,I saw Bellincione Berti walk abroad
2314,CANTO XV,In leathern girdle and a clasp of bone;
2315,CANTO XV,"And, with no artful colouring on her cheeks,"
2316,CANTO XV,His lady leave the glass. The sons I saw
2317,CANTO XV,Of Nerli and of Vecchio well content
2318,CANTO XV,With unrob’d jerkin; and their good dames handling
2319,CANTO XV,The spindle and the flax; O happy they!
2320,CANTO XV,"Each sure of burial in her native land,"
2321,CANTO XV,And none left desolate a-bed for France!
2322,CANTO XV,"One wak’d to tend the cradle, hushing it"
2323,CANTO XV,With sounds that lull’d the parent’s infancy:
2324,CANTO XV,"Another, with her maidens, drawing off"
2325,CANTO XV,"The tresses from the distaff, lectur’d them"
2326,CANTO XV,Old tales of Troy and Fesole and Rome.
2327,CANTO XV,A Salterello and Cianghella we
2328,CANTO XV,"Had held as strange a marvel, as ye would"
2329,CANTO XV,A Cincinnatus or Cornelia now.
2330,CANTO XV,
2331,CANTO XV,"“In such compos’d and seemly fellowship,"
2332,CANTO XV,"Such faithful and such fair equality,"
2333,CANTO XV,"In so sweet household, Mary at my birth"
2334,CANTO XV,"Bestow’d me, call’d on with loud cries; and there"
2335,CANTO XV,"In your old baptistery, I was made"
2336,CANTO XV,Christian at once and Cacciaguida; as were
2337,CANTO XV,"My brethren, Eliseo and Moronto."
2338,CANTO XV,
2339,CANTO XV,"“From Valdipado came to me my spouse,"
2340,CANTO XV,And hence thy surname grew. I follow’d then
2341,CANTO XV,The Emperor Conrad; and his knighthood he
2342,CANTO XV,Did gird on me; in such good part he took
2343,CANTO XV,My valiant service. After him I went
2344,CANTO XV,"To testify against that evil law,"
2345,CANTO XV,"Whose people, by the shepherd’s fault, possess"
2346,CANTO XV,"Your right, usurping. There, by that foul crew"
2347,CANTO XV,"Was I releas’d from the deceitful world,"
2348,CANTO XV,"Whose base affection many a spirit soils,"
2349,CANTO XV,And from the martyrdom came to this peace.”
2350,CANTO XV,
2351,CANTO XV,
2352,CANTO XV,
2353,CANTO XV,
2354,CANTO XVI,CANTO XVI
2355,CANTO XVI,
2356,CANTO XVI,
2357,CANTO XVI,O slight respect of man’s nobility!
2358,CANTO XVI,"I never shall account it marvelous,"
2359,CANTO XVI,That our infirm affection here below
2360,CANTO XVI,"Thou mov’st to boasting, when I could not choose,"
2361,CANTO XVI,"E’en in that region of unwarp’d desire,"
2362,CANTO XVI,"In heav’n itself, but make my vaunt in thee!"
2363,CANTO XVI,"Yet cloak thou art soon shorten’d, for that time,"
2364,CANTO XVI,"Unless thou be eked out from day to day,"
2365,CANTO XVI,Goes round thee with his shears. Resuming then
2366,CANTO XVI,"With greeting such, as Rome, was first to bear,"
2367,CANTO XVI,But since hath disaccustom’d I began;
2368,CANTO XVI,"And Beatrice, that a little space"
2369,CANTO XVI,"Was sever’d, smil’d reminding me of her,"
2370,CANTO XVI,Whose cough embolden’d (as the story holds)
2371,CANTO XVI,To first offence the doubting Guenever.
2372,CANTO XVI,
2373,CANTO XVI,"“You are my sire,” said I, “you give me heart"
2374,CANTO XVI,Freely to speak my thought: above myself
2375,CANTO XVI,You raise me. Through so many streams with joy
2376,CANTO XVI,"My soul is fill’d, that gladness wells from it;"
2377,CANTO XVI,"So that it bears the mighty tide, and bursts not"
2378,CANTO XVI,"Say then, my honour’d stem! what ancestors"
2379,CANTO XVI,"Where those you sprang from, and what years were mark’d"
2380,CANTO XVI,"In your first childhood? Tell me of the fold,"
2381,CANTO XVI,"That hath Saint John for guardian, what was then"
2382,CANTO XVI,"Its state, and who in it were highest seated?”"
2383,CANTO XVI,
2384,CANTO XVI,"As embers, at the breathing of the wind,"
2385,CANTO XVI,"Their flame enliven, so that light I saw"
2386,CANTO XVI,"Shine at my blandishments; and, as it grew"
2387,CANTO XVI,"More fair to look on, so with voice more sweet,"
2388,CANTO XVI,"Yet not in this our modern phrase, forthwith"
2389,CANTO XVI,"It answer’d: “From the day, when it was said"
2390,CANTO XVI,"‘Hail Virgin!’ to the throes, by which my mother,"
2391,CANTO XVI,"Who now is sainted, lighten’d her of me"
2392,CANTO XVI,"Whom she was heavy with, this fire had come,"
2393,CANTO XVI,"Five hundred fifty times and thrice, its beams"
2394,CANTO XVI,To reilumine underneath the foot
2395,CANTO XVI,"Of its own lion. They, of whom I sprang,"
2396,CANTO XVI,"And I, had there our birth-place, where the last"
2397,CANTO XVI,Partition of our city first is reach’d
2398,CANTO XVI,"By him, that runs her annual game. Thus much"
2399,CANTO XVI,"Suffice of my forefathers: who they were,"
2400,CANTO XVI,"And whence they hither came, more honourable"
2401,CANTO XVI,It is to pass in silence than to tell.
2402,CANTO XVI,"All those, who in that time were there from Mars"
2403,CANTO XVI,"Until the Baptist, fit to carry arms,"
2404,CANTO XVI,Were but the fifth of them this day alive.
2405,CANTO XVI,"But then the citizen’s blood, that now is mix’d"
2406,CANTO XVI,"From Campi and Certaldo and Fighine,"
2407,CANTO XVI,Ran purely through the last mechanic’s veins.
2408,CANTO XVI,"O how much better were it, that these people"
2409,CANTO XVI,"Were neighbours to you, and that at Galluzzo"
2410,CANTO XVI,"And at Trespiano, ye should have your bound’ry,"
2411,CANTO XVI,"Than to have them within, and bear the stench"
2412,CANTO XVI,"Of Aguglione’s hind, and Signa’s, him,"
2413,CANTO XVI,That hath his eye already keen for bart’ring!
2414,CANTO XVI,"Had not the people, which of all the world"
2415,CANTO XVI,"Degenerates most, been stepdame unto Caesar,"
2416,CANTO XVI,"But, as a mother, gracious to her son;"
2417,CANTO XVI,"Such one, as hath become a Florentine,"
2418,CANTO XVI,"And trades and traffics, had been turn’d adrift"
2419,CANTO XVI,"To Simifonte, where his grandsire ply’d"
2420,CANTO XVI,The beggar’s craft. The Conti were possess’d
2421,CANTO XVI,Of Montemurlo still: the Cerchi still
2422,CANTO XVI,Were in Acone’s parish; nor had haply
2423,CANTO XVI,From Valdigrieve past the Buondelmonte.
2424,CANTO XVI,The city’s malady hath ever source
2425,CANTO XVI,"In the confusion of its persons, as"
2426,CANTO XVI,"The body’s, in variety of food:"
2427,CANTO XVI,"And the blind bull falls with a steeper plunge,"
2428,CANTO XVI,Than the blind lamb; and oftentimes one sword
2429,CANTO XVI,"Doth more and better execution,"
2430,CANTO XVI,"Than five. Mark Luni, Urbisaglia mark,"
2431,CANTO XVI,"How they are gone, and after them how go"
2432,CANTO XVI,Chiusi and Sinigaglia; and ’twill seem
2433,CANTO XVI,"No longer new or strange to thee to hear,"
2434,CANTO XVI,"That families fail, when cities have their end."
2435,CANTO XVI,"All things, that appertain t’ ye, like yourselves,"
2436,CANTO XVI,Are mortal: but mortality in some
2437,CANTO XVI,"Ye mark not, they endure so long, and you"
2438,CANTO XVI,Pass by so suddenly. And as the moon
2439,CANTO XVI,"Doth, by the rolling of her heav’nly sphere,"
2440,CANTO XVI,Hide and reveal the strand unceasingly;
2441,CANTO XVI,So fortune deals with Florence. Hence admire not
2442,CANTO XVI,"At what of them I tell thee, whose renown"
2443,CANTO XVI,"Time covers, the first Florentines. I saw"
2444,CANTO XVI,"The Ughi, Catilini and Filippi,"
2445,CANTO XVI,"The Alberichi, Greci and Ormanni,"
2446,CANTO XVI,"Now in their wane, illustrious citizens:"
2447,CANTO XVI,"And great as ancient, of Sannella him,"
2448,CANTO XVI,"With him of Arca saw, and Soldanieri"
2449,CANTO XVI,"And Ardinghi, and Bostichi. At the poop,"
2450,CANTO XVI,"That now is laden with new felony,"
2451,CANTO XVI,"So cumb’rous it may speedily sink the bark,"
2452,CANTO XVI,"The Ravignani sat, of whom is sprung"
2453,CANTO XVI,"The County Guido, and whoso hath since"
2454,CANTO XVI,His title from the fam’d Bellincione ta’en.
2455,CANTO XVI,Fair governance was yet an art well priz’d
2456,CANTO XVI,By him of Pressa: Galigaio show’d
2457,CANTO XVI,"The gilded hilt and pommel, in his house."
2458,CANTO XVI,"The column, cloth’d with verrey, still was seen"
2459,CANTO XVI,"Unshaken: the Sacchetti still were great,"
2460,CANTO XVI,"Giouchi, Sifanti, Galli and Barucci,"
2461,CANTO XVI,With them who blush to hear the bushel nam’d.
2462,CANTO XVI,Of the Calfucci still the branchy trunk
2463,CANTO XVI,Was in its strength: and to the curule chairs
2464,CANTO XVI,Sizii and Arigucci yet were drawn.
2465,CANTO XVI,"How mighty them I saw, whom since their pride"
2466,CANTO XVI,Hath undone! and in all her goodly deeds
2467,CANTO XVI,Florence was by the bullets of bright gold
2468,CANTO XVI,"O’erflourish’d. Such the sires of those, who now,"
2469,CANTO XVI,"As surely as your church is vacant, flock"
2470,CANTO XVI,"Into her consistory, and at leisure"
2471,CANTO XVI,"There stall them and grow fat. The o’erweening brood,"
2472,CANTO XVI,"That plays the dragon after him that flees,"
2473,CANTO XVI,"But unto such, as turn and show the tooth,"
2474,CANTO XVI,"Ay or the purse, is gentle as a lamb,"
2475,CANTO XVI,"Was on its rise, but yet so slight esteem’d,"
2476,CANTO XVI,That Ubertino of Donati grudg’d
2477,CANTO XVI,His father-in-law should yoke him to its tribe.
2478,CANTO XVI,Already Caponsacco had descended
2479,CANTO XVI,Into the mart from Fesole: and Giuda
2480,CANTO XVI,And Infangato were good citizens.
2481,CANTO XVI,"A thing incredible I tell, tho’ true:"
2482,CANTO XVI,"The gateway, named from those of Pera, led"
2483,CANTO XVI,Into the narrow circuit of your walls.
2484,CANTO XVI,"Each one, who bears the sightly quarterings"
2485,CANTO XVI,Of the great Baron (he whose name and worth
2486,CANTO XVI,The festival of Thomas still revives)
2487,CANTO XVI,His knighthood and his privilege retain’d;
2488,CANTO XVI,"Albeit one, who borders them With gold,"
2489,CANTO XVI,This day is mingled with the common herd.
2490,CANTO XVI,"In Borgo yet the Gualterotti dwelt,"
2491,CANTO XVI,And Importuni: well for its repose
2492,CANTO XVI,Had it still lack’d of newer neighbourhood.
2493,CANTO XVI,"The house, from whence your tears have had their spring,"
2494,CANTO XVI,Through the just anger that hath murder’d ye
2495,CANTO XVI,"And put a period to your gladsome days,"
2496,CANTO XVI,"Was honour’d, it, and those consorted with it."
2497,CANTO XVI,O Buondelmonte! what ill counseling
2498,CANTO XVI,Prevail’d on thee to break the plighted bond
2499,CANTO XVI,"Many, who now are weeping, would rejoice,"
2500,CANTO XVI,"Had God to Ema giv’n thee, the first time"
2501,CANTO XVI,Thou near our city cam’st. But so was doom’d:
2502,CANTO XVI,"On that maim’d stone set up to guard the bridge,"
2503,CANTO XVI,"At thy last peace, the victim, Florence! fell."
2504,CANTO XVI,"With these and others like to them, I saw"
2505,CANTO XVI,"Florence in such assur’d tranquility,"
2506,CANTO XVI,She had no cause at which to grieve: with these
2507,CANTO XVI,"Saw her so glorious and so just, that ne’er"
2508,CANTO XVI,"The lily from the lance had hung reverse,"
2509,CANTO XVI,Or through division been with vermeil dyed.”
2510,CANTO XVI,
2511,CANTO XVI,
2512,CANTO XVI,
2513,CANTO XVI,
2514,CANTO XVII,CANTO XVII
2515,CANTO XVII,
2516,CANTO XVII,
2517,CANTO XVII,"Such as the youth, who came to Clymene"
2518,CANTO XVII,"To certify himself of that reproach,"
2519,CANTO XVII,"Which had been fasten’d on him, (he whose end"
2520,CANTO XVII,"Still makes the fathers chary to their sons),"
2521,CANTO XVII,E’en such was I; nor unobserv’d was such
2522,CANTO XVII,"Of Beatrice, and that saintly lamp,"
2523,CANTO XVII,Who had erewhile for me his station mov’d;
2524,CANTO XVII,"When thus by lady: “Give thy wish free vent,"
2525,CANTO XVII,"That it may issue, bearing true report"
2526,CANTO XVII,Of the mind’s impress; not that aught thy words
2527,CANTO XVII,"May to our knowledge add, but to the end,"
2528,CANTO XVII,That thou mayst use thyself to own thy thirst
2529,CANTO XVII,And men may mingle for thee when they hear.”
2530,CANTO XVII,
2531,CANTO XVII,“O plant! from whence I spring! rever’d and lov’d!
2532,CANTO XVII,"Who soar’st so high a pitch, thou seest as clear,"
2533,CANTO XVII,As earthly thought determines two obtuse
2534,CANTO XVII,"In one triangle not contain’d, so clear"
2535,CANTO XVII,"Dost see contingencies, ere in themselves"
2536,CANTO XVII,"Existent, looking at the point whereto"
2537,CANTO XVII,"All times are present, I, the whilst I scal’d"
2538,CANTO XVII,"With Virgil the soul purifying mount,"
2539,CANTO XVII,"And visited the nether world of woe,"
2540,CANTO XVII,Touching my future destiny have heard
2541,CANTO XVII,"Words grievous, though I feel me on all sides"
2542,CANTO XVII,Well squar’d to fortune’s blows. Therefore my will
2543,CANTO XVII,"Were satisfied to know the lot awaits me,"
2544,CANTO XVII,"The arrow, seen beforehand, slacks its flight.”"
2545,CANTO XVII,
2546,CANTO XVII,"So said I to the brightness, which erewhile"
2547,CANTO XVII,"To me had spoken, and my will declar’d,"
2548,CANTO XVII,"As Beatrice will’d, explicitly."
2549,CANTO XVII,"Nor with oracular response obscure,"
2550,CANTO XVII,"Such, as or ere the Lamb of God was slain,"
2551,CANTO XVII,"Beguil’d the credulous nations; but, in terms"
2552,CANTO XVII,"Precise and unambiguous lore, replied"
2553,CANTO XVII,"The spirit of paternal love, enshrin’d,"
2554,CANTO XVII,Yet in his smile apparent; and thus spake:
2555,CANTO XVII,"“Contingency, unfolded not to view"
2556,CANTO XVII,"Upon the tablet of your mortal mold,"
2557,CANTO XVII,Is all depictur’d in the’ eternal sight;
2558,CANTO XVII,"But hence deriveth not necessity,"
2559,CANTO XVII,"More then the tall ship, hurried down the flood,"
2560,CANTO XVII,"Doth from the vision, that reflects the scene."
2561,CANTO XVII,"From thence, as to the ear sweet harmony"
2562,CANTO XVII,"From organ comes, so comes before mine eye"
2563,CANTO XVII,The time prepar’d for thee. Such as driv’n out
2564,CANTO XVII,"From Athens, by his cruel stepdame’s wiles,"
2565,CANTO XVII,"Hippolytus departed, such must thou"
2566,CANTO XVII,"Depart from Florence. This they wish, and this"
2567,CANTO XVII,"Contrive, and will ere long effectuate, there,"
2568,CANTO XVII,"Where gainful merchandize is made of Christ,"
2569,CANTO XVII,"Throughout the livelong day. The common cry,"
2570,CANTO XVII,"Will, as ’tis ever wont, affix the blame"
2571,CANTO XVII,Unto the party injur’d: but the truth
2572,CANTO XVII,"Shall, in the vengeance it dispenseth, find"
2573,CANTO XVII,A faithful witness. Thou shall leave each thing
2574,CANTO XVII,Belov’d most dearly: this is the first shaft
2575,CANTO XVII,Shot from the bow of exile. Thou shalt prove
2576,CANTO XVII,"How salt the savour is of other’s bread,"
2577,CANTO XVII,How hard the passage to descend and climb
2578,CANTO XVII,"By other’s stairs, But that shall gall thee most"
2579,CANTO XVII,"Will be the worthless and vile company,"
2580,CANTO XVII,With whom thou must be thrown into these straits.
2581,CANTO XVII,"For all ungrateful, impious all and mad,"
2582,CANTO XVII,Shall turn ’gainst thee: but in a little while
2583,CANTO XVII,Theirs and not thine shall be the crimson’d brow
2584,CANTO XVII,Their course shall so evince their brutishness
2585,CANTO XVII,T’ have ta’en thy stand apart shall well become thee.
2586,CANTO XVII,
2587,CANTO XVII,"“First refuge thou must find, first place of rest,"
2588,CANTO XVII,"In the great Lombard’s courtesy, who bears"
2589,CANTO XVII,Upon the ladder perch’d the sacred bird.
2590,CANTO XVII,"He shall behold thee with such kind regard,"
2591,CANTO XVII,"That ’twixt ye two, the contrary to that"
2592,CANTO XVII,"Which falls ’twixt other men, the granting shall"
2593,CANTO XVII,Forerun the asking. With him shalt thou see
2594,CANTO XVII,"That mortal, who was at his birth impress"
2595,CANTO XVII,"So strongly from this star, that of his deeds"
2596,CANTO XVII,The nations shall take note. His unripe age
2597,CANTO XVII,Yet holds him from observance; for these wheels
2598,CANTO XVII,Only nine years have compass him about.
2599,CANTO XVII,"But, ere the Gascon practice on great Harry,"
2600,CANTO XVII,"Sparkles of virtue shall shoot forth in him,"
2601,CANTO XVII,In equal scorn of labours and of gold.
2602,CANTO XVII,"His bounty shall be spread abroad so widely,"
2603,CANTO XVII,As not to let the tongues e’en of his foes
2604,CANTO XVII,Be idle in its praise. Look thou to him
2605,CANTO XVII,And his beneficence: for he shall cause
2606,CANTO XVII,"Reversal of their lot to many people,"
2607,CANTO XVII,Rich men and beggars interchanging fortunes.
2608,CANTO XVII,And thou shalt bear this written in thy soul
2609,CANTO XVII,"Of him, but tell it not;” and things he told"
2610,CANTO XVII,Incredible to those who witness them;
2611,CANTO XVII,"Then added: “So interpret thou, my son,"
2612,CANTO XVII,What hath been told thee.—Lo! the ambushment
2613,CANTO XVII,That a few circling seasons hide for thee!
2614,CANTO XVII,Yet envy not thy neighbours: time extends
2615,CANTO XVII,Thy span beyond their treason’s chastisement.”
2616,CANTO XVII,
2617,CANTO XVII,"Soon, as the saintly spirit, by his silence,"
2618,CANTO XVII,"Had shown the web, which I had streteh’d for him"
2619,CANTO XVII,"Upon the warp, was woven, I began,"
2620,CANTO XVII,"As one, who in perplexity desires"
2621,CANTO XVII,"Counsel of other, wise, benign and friendly:"
2622,CANTO XVII,“My father! well I mark how time spurs on
2623,CANTO XVII,"Toward me, ready to inflict the blow,"
2624,CANTO XVII,"Which falls most heavily on him, who most"
2625,CANTO XVII,Abandoned himself. Therefore ’tis good
2626,CANTO XVII,"I should forecast, that driven from the place"
2627,CANTO XVII,"Most dear to me, I may not lose myself"
2628,CANTO XVII,All others by my song. Down through the world
2629,CANTO XVII,"Of infinite mourning, and along the mount"
2630,CANTO XVII,"From whose fair height my lady’s eyes did lift me,"
2631,CANTO XVII,"And after through this heav’n from light to light,"
2632,CANTO XVII,"Have I learnt that, which if I tell again,"
2633,CANTO XVII,It may with many woefully disrelish;
2634,CANTO XVII,"And, if I am a timid friend to truth,"
2635,CANTO XVII,"I fear my life may perish among those,"
2636,CANTO XVII,To whom these days shall be of ancient date.”
2637,CANTO XVII,
2638,CANTO XVII,"The brightness, where enclos’d the treasure smil’d,"
2639,CANTO XVII,"Which I had found there, first shone glisteningly,"
2640,CANTO XVII,Like to a golden mirror in the sun;
2641,CANTO XVII,"Next answer’d: “Conscience, dimm’d or by its own"
2642,CANTO XVII,"Or other’s shame, will feel thy saying sharp."
2643,CANTO XVII,"Thou, notwithstanding, all deceit remov’d,"
2644,CANTO XVII,See the whole vision be made manifest.
2645,CANTO XVII,And let them wince who have their withers wrung.
2646,CANTO XVII,"What though, when tasted first, thy voice shall prove"
2647,CANTO XVII,"Unwelcome, on digestion it will turn"
2648,CANTO XVII,"To vital nourishment. The cry thou raisest,"
2649,CANTO XVII,"Shall, as the wind doth, smite the proudest summits;"
2650,CANTO XVII,"Which is of honour no light argument,"
2651,CANTO XVII,"For this there only have been shown to thee,"
2652,CANTO XVII,"Throughout these orbs, the mountain, and the deep,"
2653,CANTO XVII,"Spirits, whom fame hath note of. For the mind"
2654,CANTO XVII,"Of him, who hears, is loth to acquiesce"
2655,CANTO XVII,"And fix its faith, unless the instance brought"
2656,CANTO XVII,"Be palpable, and proof apparent urge.”"
2657,CANTO XVII,
2658,CANTO XVII,
2659,CANTO XVII,
2660,CANTO XVII,
2661,CANTO XVIII,CANTO XVIII
2662,CANTO XVIII,
2663,CANTO XVIII,
2664,CANTO XVIII,"Now in his word, sole, ruminating, joy’d"
2665,CANTO XVIII,"That blessed spirit; and I fed on mine,"
2666,CANTO XVIII,"Tempting the sweet with bitter: she meanwhile,"
2667,CANTO XVIII,"Who led me unto God, admonish’d: “Muse"
2668,CANTO XVIII,"On other thoughts: bethink thee, that near Him"
2669,CANTO XVIII,"I dwell, who recompenseth every wrong.”"
2670,CANTO XVIII,
2671,CANTO XVIII,At the sweet sounds of comfort straight I turn’d;
2672,CANTO XVIII,"And, in the saintly eyes what love was seen,"
2673,CANTO XVIII,I leave in silence here: nor through distrust
2674,CANTO XVIII,"Of my words only, but that to such bliss"
2675,CANTO XVIII,The mind remounts not without aid. Thus much
2676,CANTO XVIII,"Yet may I speak; that, as I gaz’d on her,"
2677,CANTO XVIII,Affection found no room for other wish.
2678,CANTO XVIII,"While the everlasting pleasure, that did full"
2679,CANTO XVIII,"On Beatrice shine, with second view"
2680,CANTO XVIII,From her fair countenance my gladden’d soul
2681,CANTO XVIII,Contented; vanquishing me with a beam
2682,CANTO XVIII,"Of her soft smile, she spake: “Turn thee, and list."
2683,CANTO XVIII,These eyes are not thy only Paradise.”
2684,CANTO XVIII,
2685,CANTO XVIII,As here we sometimes in the looks may see
2686,CANTO XVIII,"Th’ affection mark’d, when that its sway hath ta’en"
2687,CANTO XVIII,"The spirit wholly; thus the hallow’d light,"
2688,CANTO XVIII,"To whom I turn’d, flashing, bewray’d its will"
2689,CANTO XVIII,"To talk yet further with me, and began:"
2690,CANTO XVIII,"“On this fifth lodgment of the tree, whose life"
2691,CANTO XVIII,"Is from its top, whose fruit is ever fair"
2692,CANTO XVIII,"And leaf unwith’ring, blessed spirits abide,"
2693,CANTO XVIII,"That were below, ere they arriv’d in heav’n,"
2694,CANTO XVIII,"So mighty in renown, as every muse"
2695,CANTO XVIII,Might grace her triumph with them. On the horns
2696,CANTO XVIII,"Look therefore of the cross: he, whom I name,"
2697,CANTO XVIII,"Shall there enact, as doth in summer cloud"
2698,CANTO XVIII,"Its nimble fire.” Along the cross I saw,"
2699,CANTO XVIII,"At the repeated name of Joshua,"
2700,CANTO XVIII,"A splendour gliding; nor, the word was said,"
2701,CANTO XVIII,"Ere it was done: then, at the naming saw"
2702,CANTO XVIII,"Of the great Maccabee, another move"
2703,CANTO XVIII,With whirling speed; and gladness was the scourge
2704,CANTO XVIII,Unto that top. The next for Charlemagne
2705,CANTO XVIII,"And for the peer Orlando, two my gaze"
2706,CANTO XVIII,"Pursued, intently, as the eye pursues"
2707,CANTO XVIII,"A falcon flying. Last, along the cross,"
2708,CANTO XVIII,"William, and Renard, and Duke Godfrey drew"
2709,CANTO XVIII,"My ken, and Robert Guiscard. And the soul,"
2710,CANTO XVIII,Who spake with me among the other lights
2711,CANTO XVIII,"Did move away, and mix; and with the choir"
2712,CANTO XVIII,Of heav’nly songsters prov’d his tuneful skill.
2713,CANTO XVIII,
2714,CANTO XVIII,"To Beatrice on my right l bent,"
2715,CANTO XVIII,Looking for intimation or by word
2716,CANTO XVIII,"Or act, what next behoov’d; and did descry"
2717,CANTO XVIII,"Such mere effulgence in her eyes, such joy,"
2718,CANTO XVIII,"It past all former wont. And, as by sense"
2719,CANTO XVIII,"Of new delight, the man, who perseveres"
2720,CANTO XVIII,In good deeds doth perceive from day to day
2721,CANTO XVIII,His virtue growing; I e’en thus perceiv’d
2722,CANTO XVIII,"Of my ascent, together with the heav’n"
2723,CANTO XVIII,"The circuit widen’d, noting the increase"
2724,CANTO XVIII,Of beauty in that wonder. Like the change
2725,CANTO XVIII,"In a brief moment on some maiden’s cheek,"
2726,CANTO XVIII,Which from its fairness doth discharge the weight
2727,CANTO XVIII,"Of pudency, that stain’d it; such in her,"
2728,CANTO XVIII,"And to mine eyes so sudden was the change,"
2729,CANTO XVIII,"Through silvery whiteness of that temperate star,"
2730,CANTO XVIII,"Whose sixth orb now enfolded us. I saw,"
2731,CANTO XVIII,"Within that Jovial cresset, the clear sparks"
2732,CANTO XVIII,"Of love, that reign’d there, fashion to my view"
2733,CANTO XVIII,"Our language. And as birds, from river banks"
2734,CANTO XVIII,"Arisen, now in round, now lengthen’d troop,"
2735,CANTO XVIII,"Array them in their flight, greeting, as seems,"
2736,CANTO XVIII,"Their new-found pastures; so, within the lights,"
2737,CANTO XVIII,"The saintly creatures flying, sang, and made"
2738,CANTO XVIII,Now D. now I. now L. figur’d I’ th’ air.
2739,CANTO XVIII,
2740,CANTO XVIII,"First, singing, to their notes they mov’d, then one"
2741,CANTO XVIII,"Becoming of these signs, a little while"
2742,CANTO XVIII,"Did rest them, and were mute. O nymph divine"
2743,CANTO XVIII,"Of Pegasean race! whose souls, which thou"
2744,CANTO XVIII,"Inspir’st, mak’st glorious and long-liv’d, as they"
2745,CANTO XVIII,Cities and realms by thee! thou with thyself
2746,CANTO XVIII,"Inform me; that I may set forth the shapes,"
2747,CANTO XVIII,As fancy doth present them. Be thy power
2748,CANTO XVIII,"Display’d in this brief song. The characters,"
2749,CANTO XVIII,"Vocal and consonant, were five-fold seven."
2750,CANTO XVIII,"In order each, as they appear’d, I mark’d."
2751,CANTO XVIII,"Diligite Justitiam, the first,"
2752,CANTO XVIII,Both verb and noun all blazon’d; and the extreme
2753,CANTO XVIII,Qui judicatis terram. In the M.
2754,CANTO XVIII,"Of the fifth word they held their station,"
2755,CANTO XVIII,Making the star seem silver streak’d with gold.
2756,CANTO XVIII,And on the summit of the M. I saw
2757,CANTO XVIII,"Descending other lights, that rested there,"
2758,CANTO XVIII,"Singing, methinks, their bliss and primal good."
2759,CANTO XVIII,"Then, as at shaking of a lighted brand,"
2760,CANTO XVIII,Sparkles innumerable on all sides
2761,CANTO XVIII,"Rise scatter’d, source of augury to th’ unwise;"
2762,CANTO XVIII,Thus more than thousand twinkling lustres hence
2763,CANTO XVIII,"Seem’d reascending, and a higher pitch"
2764,CANTO XVIII,"Some mounting, and some less; e’en as the sun,"
2765,CANTO XVIII,"Which kindleth them, decreed. And when each one"
2766,CANTO XVIII,"Had settled in his place, the head and neck"
2767,CANTO XVIII,"Then saw I of an eagle, lively"
2768,CANTO XVIII,"Grav’d in that streaky fire. Who painteth there,"
2769,CANTO XVIII,Hath none to guide him; of himself he guides;
2770,CANTO XVIII,And every line and texture of the nest
2771,CANTO XVIII,"Doth own from him the virtue, fashions it."
2772,CANTO XVIII,"The other bright beatitude, that seem’d"
2773,CANTO XVIII,"Erewhile, with lilied crowning, well content"
2774,CANTO XVIII,"To over-canopy the M. mov’d forth,"
2775,CANTO XVIII,Following gently the impress of the bird.
2776,CANTO XVIII,
2777,CANTO XVIII,Sweet star! what glorious and thick-studded gems
2778,CANTO XVIII,Declar’d to me our justice on the earth
2779,CANTO XVIII,"To be the effluence of that heav’n, which thou,"
2780,CANTO XVIII,"Thyself a costly jewel, dost inlay!"
2781,CANTO XVIII,"Therefore I pray the Sovran Mind, from whom"
2782,CANTO XVIII,"Thy motion and thy virtue are begun,"
2783,CANTO XVIII,"That he would look from whence the fog doth rise,"
2784,CANTO XVIII,To vitiate thy beam: so that once more
2785,CANTO XVIII,"He may put forth his hand ’gainst such, as drive"
2786,CANTO XVIII,"Their traffic in that sanctuary, whose walls"
2787,CANTO XVIII,With miracles and martyrdoms were built.
2788,CANTO XVIII,
2789,CANTO XVIII,Ye host of heaven! whose glory I survey!
2790,CANTO XVIII,"O beg ye grace for those, that are on earth"
2791,CANTO XVIII,All after ill example gone astray.
2792,CANTO XVIII,War once had for its instrument the sword:
2793,CANTO XVIII,"But now ’tis made, taking the bread away"
2794,CANTO XVIII,"Which the good Father locks from none.—And thou,"
2795,CANTO XVIII,"That writes but to cancel, think, that they,"
2796,CANTO XVIII,"Who for the vineyard, which thou wastest, died,"
2797,CANTO XVIII,"Peter and Paul live yet, and mark thy doings."
2798,CANTO XVIII,"Thou hast good cause to cry, “My heart so cleaves"
2799,CANTO XVIII,"To him, that liv’d in solitude remote,"
2800,CANTO XVIII,"And from the wilds was dragg’d to martyrdom,"
2801,CANTO XVIII,I wist not of the fisherman nor Paul.”
2802,CANTO XVIII,
2803,CANTO XVIII,
2804,CANTO XVIII,
2805,CANTO XVIII,
2806,CANTO XIX,CANTO XIX
2807,CANTO XIX,
2808,CANTO XIX,
2809,CANTO XIX,"Before my sight appear’d, with open wings,"
2810,CANTO XIX,"The beauteous image, in fruition sweet"
2811,CANTO XIX,Gladdening the thronged spirits. Each did seem
2812,CANTO XIX,"A little ruby, whereon so intense"
2813,CANTO XIX,The sun-beam glow’d that to mine eyes it came
2814,CANTO XIX,"In clear refraction. And that, which next"
2815,CANTO XIX,"Befalls me to portray, voice hath not utter’d,"
2816,CANTO XIX,"Nor hath ink written, nor in fantasy"
2817,CANTO XIX,Was e’er conceiv’d. For I beheld and heard
2818,CANTO XIX,"The beak discourse; and, what intention form’d"
2819,CANTO XIX,"Of many, singly as of one express,"
2820,CANTO XIX,"Beginning: “For that I was just and piteous,"
2821,CANTO XIX,"l am exalted to this height of glory,"
2822,CANTO XIX,The which no wish exceeds: and there on earth
2823,CANTO XIX,"Have I my memory left, e’en by the bad"
2824,CANTO XIX,"Commended, while they leave its course untrod.”"
2825,CANTO XIX,
2826,CANTO XIX,"Thus is one heat from many embers felt,"
2827,CANTO XIX,"As in that image many were the loves,"
2828,CANTO XIX,"And one the voice, that issued from them all."
2829,CANTO XIX,Whence I address them: “O perennial flowers
2830,CANTO XIX,Of gladness everlasting! that exhale
2831,CANTO XIX,In single breath your odours manifold!
2832,CANTO XIX,"Breathe now; and let the hunger be appeas’d,"
2833,CANTO XIX,"That with great craving long hath held my soul,"
2834,CANTO XIX,"Finding no food on earth. This well I know,"
2835,CANTO XIX,"That if there be in heav’n a realm, that shows"
2836,CANTO XIX,"In faithful mirror the celestial Justice,"
2837,CANTO XIX,Yours without veil reflects it. Ye discern
2838,CANTO XIX,"The heed, wherewith I do prepare myself"
2839,CANTO XIX,To hearken; ye the doubt that urges me
2840,CANTO XIX,"With such inveterate craving.” Straight I saw,"
2841,CANTO XIX,"Like to a falcon issuing from the hood,"
2842,CANTO XIX,"That rears his head, and claps him with his wings,"
2843,CANTO XIX,His beauty and his eagerness bewraying.
2844,CANTO XIX,"So saw I move that stately sign, with praise"
2845,CANTO XIX,Of grace divine inwoven and high song
2846,CANTO XIX,"Of inexpressive joy. “He,” it began,"
2847,CANTO XIX,"“Who turn’d his compass on the world’s extreme,"
2848,CANTO XIX,"And in that space so variously hath wrought,"
2849,CANTO XIX,"Both openly, and in secret, in such wise"
2850,CANTO XIX,Could not through all the universe display
2851,CANTO XIX,"Impression of his glory, that the Word"
2852,CANTO XIX,Of his omniscience should not still remain
2853,CANTO XIX,"In infinite excess. In proof whereof,"
2854,CANTO XIX,"He first through pride supplanted, who was sum"
2855,CANTO XIX,"Of each created being, waited not"
2856,CANTO XIX,"For light celestial, and abortive fell."
2857,CANTO XIX,Whence needs each lesser nature is but scant
2858,CANTO XIX,"Receptacle unto that Good, which knows"
2859,CANTO XIX,"No limit, measur’d by itself alone."
2860,CANTO XIX,"Therefore your sight, of th’ omnipresent Mind"
2861,CANTO XIX,"A single beam, its origin must own"
2862,CANTO XIX,Surpassing far its utmost potency.
2863,CANTO XIX,"The ken, your world is gifted with, descends"
2864,CANTO XIX,"In th’ everlasting Justice as low down,"
2865,CANTO XIX,As eye doth in the sea; which though it mark
2866,CANTO XIX,"The bottom from the shore, in the wide main"
2867,CANTO XIX,"Discerns it not; and ne’ertheless it is,"
2868,CANTO XIX,"But hidden through its deepness. Light is none,"
2869,CANTO XIX,Save that which cometh from the pure serene
2870,CANTO XIX,"Of ne’er disturbed ether: for the rest,"
2871,CANTO XIX,"’Tis darkness all, or shadow of the flesh,"
2872,CANTO XIX,Or else its poison. Here confess reveal’d
2873,CANTO XIX,"That covert, which hath hidden from thy search"
2874,CANTO XIX,"The living justice, of the which thou mad’st"
2875,CANTO XIX,Such frequent question; for thou saidst—‘A man
2876,CANTO XIX,"Is born on Indus’ banks, and none is there"
2877,CANTO XIX,"Who speaks of Christ, nor who doth read nor write,"
2878,CANTO XIX,"And all his inclinations and his acts,"
2879,CANTO XIX,"As far as human reason sees, are good,"
2880,CANTO XIX,And he offendeth not in word or deed.
2881,CANTO XIX,"But unbaptiz’d he dies, and void of faith."
2882,CANTO XIX,Where is the justice that condemns him? where
2883,CANTO XIX,"His blame, if he believeth not?’—What then,"
2884,CANTO XIX,"And who art thou, that on the stool wouldst sit"
2885,CANTO XIX,To judge at distance of a thousand miles
2886,CANTO XIX,With the short-sighted vision of a span?
2887,CANTO XIX,"To him, who subtilizes thus with me,"
2888,CANTO XIX,There would assuredly be room for doubt
2889,CANTO XIX,"Even to wonder, did not the safe word"
2890,CANTO XIX,Of scripture hold supreme authority.
2891,CANTO XIX,
2892,CANTO XIX,“O animals of clay! O spirits gross I
2893,CANTO XIX,"The primal will, that in itself is good,"
2894,CANTO XIX,"Hath from itself, the chief Good, ne’er been mov’d."
2895,CANTO XIX,"Justice consists in consonance with it,"
2896,CANTO XIX,"Derivable by no created good,"
2897,CANTO XIX,Whose very cause depends upon its beam.”
2898,CANTO XIX,
2899,CANTO XIX,"As on her nest the stork, that turns about"
2900,CANTO XIX,"Unto her young, whom lately she hath fed,"
2901,CANTO XIX,While they with upward eyes do look on her;
2902,CANTO XIX,So lifted I my gaze; and bending so
2903,CANTO XIX,"The ever-blessed image wav’d its wings,"
2904,CANTO XIX,Lab’ring with such deep counsel. Wheeling round
2905,CANTO XIX,"It warbled, and did say: “As are my notes"
2906,CANTO XIX,"To thee, who understand’st them not, such is"
2907,CANTO XIX,Th’ eternal judgment unto mortal ken.”
2908,CANTO XIX,
2909,CANTO XIX,"Then still abiding in that ensign rang’d,"
2910,CANTO XIX,"Wherewith the Romans over-awed the world,"
2911,CANTO XIX,Those burning splendours of the Holy Spirit
2912,CANTO XIX,Took up the strain; and thus it spake again:
2913,CANTO XIX,"“None ever hath ascended to this realm,"
2914,CANTO XIX,"Who hath not a believer been in Christ,"
2915,CANTO XIX,Either before or after the blest limbs
2916,CANTO XIX,Were nail’d upon the wood. But lo! of those
2917,CANTO XIX,"Who call ‘Christ, Christ,’ there shall be many found,"
2918,CANTO XIX,"In judgment, further off from him by far,"
2919,CANTO XIX,"Than such, to whom his name was never known."
2920,CANTO XIX,Christians like these the Ethiop shall condemn:
2921,CANTO XIX,When that the two assemblages shall part;
2922,CANTO XIX,"One rich eternally, the other poor."
2923,CANTO XIX,
2924,CANTO XIX,"“What may the Persians say unto your kings,"
2925,CANTO XIX,"When they shall see that volume, in the which"
2926,CANTO XIX,"All their dispraise is written, spread to view?"
2927,CANTO XIX,"There amidst Albert’s works shall that be read,"
2928,CANTO XIX,"Which will give speedy motion to the pen,"
2929,CANTO XIX,When Prague shall mourn her desolated realm.
2930,CANTO XIX,"There shall be read the woe, that he doth work"
2931,CANTO XIX,"With his adulterate money on the Seine,"
2932,CANTO XIX,Who by the tusk will perish: there be read
2933,CANTO XIX,"The thirsting pride, that maketh fool alike"
2934,CANTO XIX,"The English and Scot, impatient of their bound."
2935,CANTO XIX,"There shall be seen the Spaniard’s luxury,"
2936,CANTO XIX,"The delicate living there of the Bohemian,"
2937,CANTO XIX,Who still to worth has been a willing stranger.
2938,CANTO XIX,The halter of Jerusalem shall see
2939,CANTO XIX,"A unit for his virtue, for his vices"
2940,CANTO XIX,"No less a mark than million. He, who guards"
2941,CANTO XIX,The isle of fire by old Anchises honour’d
2942,CANTO XIX,Shall find his avarice there and cowardice;
2943,CANTO XIX,"And better to denote his littleness,"
2944,CANTO XIX,"The writing must be letters maim’d, that speak"
2945,CANTO XIX,Much in a narrow space. All there shall know
2946,CANTO XIX,"His uncle and his brother’s filthy doings,"
2947,CANTO XIX,Who so renown’d a nation and two crowns
2948,CANTO XIX,"Have bastardized. And they, of Portugal"
2949,CANTO XIX,"And Norway, there shall be expos’d with him"
2950,CANTO XIX,"Of Ratza, who hath counterfeited ill"
2951,CANTO XIX,The coin of Venice. O blest Hungary!
2952,CANTO XIX,If thou no longer patiently abid’st
2953,CANTO XIX,"Thy ill-entreating! and, O blest Navarre!"
2954,CANTO XIX,If with thy mountainous girdle thou wouldst arm thee
2955,CANTO XIX,"In earnest of that day, e’en now are heard"
2956,CANTO XIX,Wailings and groans in Famagosta’s streets
2957,CANTO XIX,"And Nicosia’s, grudging at their beast,"
2958,CANTO XIX,Who keepeth even footing with the rest.”

2963,CANTO XX,CANTO XX
2964,CANTO XX,
2965,CANTO XX,
2966,CANTO XX,"When, disappearing, from our hemisphere,"
2967,CANTO XX,"The world’s enlightener vanishes, and day"
2968,CANTO XX,"On all sides wasteth, suddenly the sky,"
2969,CANTO XX,"Erewhile irradiate only with his beam,"
2970,CANTO XX,"Is yet again unfolded, putting forth"
2971,CANTO XX,Innumerable lights wherein one shines.
2972,CANTO XX,"Of such vicissitude in heaven I thought,"
2973,CANTO XX,"As the great sign, that marshaleth the world"
2974,CANTO XX,"And the world’s leaders, in the blessed beak"
2975,CANTO XX,"Was silent; for that all those living lights,"
2976,CANTO XX,"Waxing in splendour, burst forth into songs,"
2977,CANTO XX,Such as from memory glide and fall away.
2978,CANTO XX,
2979,CANTO XX,"Sweet love! that dost apparel thee in smiles,"
2980,CANTO XX,"How lustrous was thy semblance in those sparkles,"
2981,CANTO XX,Which merely are from holy thoughts inspir’d!
2982,CANTO XX,
2983,CANTO XX,"After the precious and bright beaming stones,"
2984,CANTO XX,"That did ingem the sixth light, ceas’d the chiming"
2985,CANTO XX,Of their angelic bells; methought I heard
2986,CANTO XX,"The murmuring of a river, that doth fall"
2987,CANTO XX,"From rock to rock transpicuous, making known"
2988,CANTO XX,The richness of his spring-head: and as sound
2989,CANTO XX,"Of cistern, at the fret-board, or of pipe,"
2990,CANTO XX,"Is, at the wind-hole, modulate and tun’d;"
2991,CANTO XX,"Thus up the neck, as it were hollow, rose"
2992,CANTO XX,"That murmuring of the eagle, and forthwith"
2993,CANTO XX,"Voice there assum’d, and thence along the beak"
2994,CANTO XX,"Issued in form of words, such as my heart"
2995,CANTO XX,"Did look for, on whose tables I inscrib’d them."
2996,CANTO XX,
2997,CANTO XX,"“The part in me, that sees, and bears the sun,,"
2998,CANTO XX,"In mortal eagles,” it began, “must now"
2999,CANTO XX,"Be noted steadfastly: for of the fires,"
3000,CANTO XX,"That figure me, those, glittering in mine eye,"
3001,CANTO XX,"Are chief of all the greatest. This, that shines"
3002,CANTO XX,"Midmost for pupil, was the same, who sang"
3003,CANTO XX,"The Holy Spirit’s song, and bare about"
3004,CANTO XX,The ark from town to town; now doth he know
3005,CANTO XX,The merit of his soul-impassion’d strains
3006,CANTO XX,"By their well-fitted guerdon. Of the five,"
3007,CANTO XX,"That make the circle of the vision, he"
3008,CANTO XX,"Who to the beak is nearest, comforted"
3009,CANTO XX,The widow for her son: now doth he know
3010,CANTO XX,"How dear he costeth not to follow Christ,"
3011,CANTO XX,"Both from experience of this pleasant life,"
3012,CANTO XX,"And of its opposite. He next, who follows"
3013,CANTO XX,"In the circumference, for the over arch,"
3014,CANTO XX,By true repenting slack’d the pace of death:
3015,CANTO XX,"Now knoweth he, that the degrees of heav’n"
3016,CANTO XX,"Alter not, when through pious prayer below"
3017,CANTO XX,Today’s is made tomorrow’s destiny.
3018,CANTO XX,"The other following, with the laws and me,"
3019,CANTO XX,"To yield the shepherd room, pass’d o’er to Greece,"
3020,CANTO XX,From good intent producing evil fruit:
3021,CANTO XX,"Now knoweth he, how all the ill, deriv’d"
3022,CANTO XX,"From his well doing, doth not helm him aught,"
3023,CANTO XX,Though it have brought destruction on the world.
3024,CANTO XX,"That, which thou seest in the under bow,"
3025,CANTO XX,"Was William, whom that land bewails, which weeps"
3026,CANTO XX,For Charles and Frederick living: now he knows
3027,CANTO XX,"How well is lov’d in heav’n the righteous king,"
3028,CANTO XX,Which he betokens by his radiant seeming.
3029,CANTO XX,"Who in the erring world beneath would deem,"
3030,CANTO XX,That Trojan Ripheus in this round was set
3031,CANTO XX,Fifth of the saintly splendours? now he knows
3032,CANTO XX,"Enough of that, which the world cannot see,"
3033,CANTO XX,"The grace divine, albeit e’en his sight"
3034,CANTO XX,"Reach not its utmost depth.” Like to the lark,"
3035,CANTO XX,"That warbling in the air expatiates long,"
3036,CANTO XX,"Then, trilling out his last sweet melody,"
3037,CANTO XX,Drops satiate with the sweetness; such appear’d
3038,CANTO XX,"That image stampt by the’ everlasting pleasure,"
3039,CANTO XX,Which fashions like itself all lovely things.
3040,CANTO XX,
3041,CANTO XX,"I, though my doubting were as manifest,"
3042,CANTO XX,"As is through glass the hue that mantles it,"
3043,CANTO XX,In silence waited not: for to my lips
3044,CANTO XX,"“What things are these?” involuntary rush’d,"
3045,CANTO XX,And forc’d a passage out: whereat I mark’d
3046,CANTO XX,A sudden lightening and new revelry.
3047,CANTO XX,The eye was kindled: and the blessed sign
3048,CANTO XX,"No more to keep me wond’ring and suspense,"
3049,CANTO XX,"Replied: “I see that thou believ’st these things,"
3050,CANTO XX,"Because I tell them, but discern’st not how;"
3051,CANTO XX,So that thy knowledge waits not on thy faith:
3052,CANTO XX,"As one who knows the name of thing by rote,"
3053,CANTO XX,"But is a stranger to its properties,"
3054,CANTO XX,Till other’s tongue reveal them. Fervent love
3055,CANTO XX,And lively hope with violence assail
3056,CANTO XX,"The kingdom of the heavens, and overcome"
3057,CANTO XX,The will of the Most high; not in such sort
3058,CANTO XX,"As man prevails o’er man; but conquers it,"
3059,CANTO XX,"Because ’tis willing to be conquer’d, still,"
3060,CANTO XX,"Though conquer’d, by its mercy conquering."
3061,CANTO XX,
3062,CANTO XX,"“Those, in the eye who live the first and fifth,"
3063,CANTO XX,"Cause thee to marvel, in that thou behold’st"
3064,CANTO XX,The region of the angels deck’d with them.
3065,CANTO XX,"They quitted not their bodies, as thou deem’st,"
3066,CANTO XX,"Gentiles but Christians, in firm rooted faith,"
3067,CANTO XX,"This of the feet in future to be pierc’d,"
3068,CANTO XX,That of feet nail’d already to the cross.
3069,CANTO XX,"One from the barrier of the dark abyss,"
3070,CANTO XX,"Where never any with good will returns,"
3071,CANTO XX,Came back unto his bones. Of lively hope
3072,CANTO XX,"Such was the meed; of lively hope, that wing’d"
3073,CANTO XX,"The prayers sent up to God for his release,"
3074,CANTO XX,And put power into them to bend his will.
3075,CANTO XX,"The glorious Spirit, of whom I speak to thee,"
3076,CANTO XX,"A little while returning to the flesh,"
3077,CANTO XX,"Believ’d in him, who had the means to help,"
3078,CANTO XX,"And, in believing, nourish’d such a flame"
3079,CANTO XX,"Of holy love, that at the second death"
3080,CANTO XX,He was made sharer in our gamesome mirth.
3081,CANTO XX,"The other, through the riches of that grace,"
3082,CANTO XX,"Which from so deep a fountain doth distil,"
3083,CANTO XX,"As never eye created saw its rising,"
3084,CANTO XX,Plac’d all his love below on just and right:
3085,CANTO XX,Wherefore of grace God op’d in him the eye
3086,CANTO XX,To the redemption of mankind to come;
3087,CANTO XX,"Wherein believing, he endur’d no more"
3088,CANTO XX,"The filth of paganism, and for their ways"
3089,CANTO XX,"Rebuk’d the stubborn nations. The three nymphs,"
3090,CANTO XX,"Whom at the right wheel thou beheldst advancing,"
3091,CANTO XX,Were sponsors for him more than thousand years
3092,CANTO XX,"Before baptizing. O how far remov’d,"
3093,CANTO XX,Predestination! is thy root from such
3094,CANTO XX,"As see not the First cause entire: and ye,"
3095,CANTO XX,O mortal men! be wary how ye judge:
3096,CANTO XX,"For we, who see our Maker, know not yet"
3097,CANTO XX,The number of the chosen: and esteem
3098,CANTO XX,Such scantiness of knowledge our delight:
3099,CANTO XX,For all our good is in that primal good
3100,CANTO XX,"Concentrate, and God’s will and ours are one.”"
3101,CANTO XX,
3102,CANTO XX,"So, by that form divine, was giv’n to me"
3103,CANTO XX,"Sweet medicine to clear and strengthen sight,"
3104,CANTO XX,"And, as one handling skillfully the harp,"
3105,CANTO XX,Attendant on some skilful songster’s voice
3106,CANTO XX,"Bids the chords vibrate, and therein the song"
3107,CANTO XX,"Acquires more pleasure; so, the whilst it spake,"
3108,CANTO XX,"It doth remember me, that I beheld"
3109,CANTO XX,The pair of blessed luminaries move.
3110,CANTO XX,"Like the accordant twinkling of two eyes,"
3111,CANTO XX,"Their beamy circlets, dancing to the sounds."
3112,CANTO XX,
3113,CANTO XX,
3114,CANTO XX,
3115,CANTO XX,
3116,CANTO XXI,CANTO XXI
3117,CANTO XXI,
3118,CANTO XXI,
3119,CANTO XXI,"Again mine eyes were fix’d on Beatrice,"
3120,CANTO XXI,"And with mine eyes my soul, that in her looks"
3121,CANTO XXI,Found all contentment. Yet no smile she wore
3122,CANTO XXI,"And, “Did I smile,” quoth she, “thou wouldst be straight"
3123,CANTO XXI,Like Semele when into ashes turn’d:
3124,CANTO XXI,"For, mounting these eternal palace-stairs,"
3125,CANTO XXI,"My beauty, which the loftier it climbs,"
3126,CANTO XXI,"As thou hast noted, still doth kindle more,"
3127,CANTO XXI,"So shines, that, were no temp’ring interpos’d,"
3128,CANTO XXI,Thy mortal puissance would from its rays
3129,CANTO XXI,"Shrink, as the leaf doth from the thunderbolt."
3130,CANTO XXI,"Into the seventh splendour are we wafted,"
3131,CANTO XXI,That underneath the burning lion’s breast
3132,CANTO XXI,"Beams, in this hour, commingled with his might,"
3133,CANTO XXI,Thy mind be with thine eyes: and in them mirror’d
3134,CANTO XXI,"The shape, which in this mirror shall be shown.”"
3135,CANTO XXI,"Whoso can deem, how fondly I had fed"
3136,CANTO XXI,"My sight upon her blissful countenance,"
3137,CANTO XXI,"May know, when to new thoughts I chang’d, what joy"
3138,CANTO XXI,To do the bidding of my heav’nly guide:
3139,CANTO XXI,In equal balance poising either weight.
3140,CANTO XXI,
3141,CANTO XXI,"Within the crystal, which records the name,"
3142,CANTO XXI,(As its remoter circle girds the world)
3143,CANTO XXI,"Of that lov’d monarch, in whose happy reign"
3144,CANTO XXI,"No ill had power to harm, I saw rear’d up,"
3145,CANTO XXI,In colour like to sun-illumin’d gold.
3146,CANTO XXI,
3147,CANTO XXI,"A ladder, which my ken pursued in vain,"
3148,CANTO XXI,So lofty was the summit; down whose steps
3149,CANTO XXI,I saw the splendours in such multitude
3150,CANTO XXI,"Descending, ev’ry light in heav’n, methought,"
3151,CANTO XXI,"Was shed thence. As the rooks, at dawn of day"
3152,CANTO XXI,"Bestirring them to dry their feathers chill,"
3153,CANTO XXI,"Some speed their way a-field, and homeward some,"
3154,CANTO XXI,"Returning, cross their flight, while some abide"
3155,CANTO XXI,And wheel around their airy lodge; so seem’d
3156,CANTO XXI,"That glitterance, wafted on alternate wing,"
3157,CANTO XXI,"As upon certain stair it met, and clash’d"
3158,CANTO XXI,"Its shining. And one ling’ring near us, wax’d"
3159,CANTO XXI,"So bright, that in my thought: said: “The love,"
3160,CANTO XXI,"Which this betokens me, admits no doubt.”"
3161,CANTO XXI,
3162,CANTO XXI,"Unwillingly from question I refrain,"
3163,CANTO XXI,"To her, by whom my silence and my speech"
3164,CANTO XXI,"Are order’d, looking for a sign: whence she,"
3165,CANTO XXI,"Who in the sight of Him, that seeth all,"
3166,CANTO XXI,"Saw wherefore I was silent, prompted me"
3167,CANTO XXI,T’ indulge the fervent wish; and I began:
3168,CANTO XXI,"“I am not worthy, of my own desert,"
3169,CANTO XXI,"That thou shouldst answer me; but for her sake,"
3170,CANTO XXI,"Who hath vouchsaf’d my asking, spirit blest!"
3171,CANTO XXI,"That in thy joy art shrouded! say the cause,"
3172,CANTO XXI,"Which bringeth thee so near: and wherefore, say,"
3173,CANTO XXI,Doth the sweet symphony of Paradise
3174,CANTO XXI,"Keep silence here, pervading with such sounds"
3175,CANTO XXI,Of rapt devotion ev’ry lower sphere?”
3176,CANTO XXI,“Mortal art thou in hearing as in sight;”
3177,CANTO XXI,Was the reply: “and what forbade the smile
3178,CANTO XXI,Of Beatrice interrupts our song.
3179,CANTO XXI,"Only to yield thee gladness of my voice,"
3180,CANTO XXI,"And of the light that vests me, I thus far"
3181,CANTO XXI,Descend these hallow’d steps: not that more love
3182,CANTO XXI,"Invites me; for lo! there aloft, as much"
3183,CANTO XXI,Or more of love is witness’d in those flames:
3184,CANTO XXI,"But such my lot by charity assign’d,"
3185,CANTO XXI,"That makes us ready servants, as thou seest,"
3186,CANTO XXI,To execute the counsel of the Highest.”
3187,CANTO XXI,"“That in this court,” said I, “O sacred lamp!"
3188,CANTO XXI,"Love no compulsion needs, but follows free"
3189,CANTO XXI,"Th’ eternal Providence, I well discern:"
3190,CANTO XXI,"This harder find to deem, why of thy peers"
3191,CANTO XXI,Thou only to this office wert foredoom’d.”
3192,CANTO XXI,"I had not ended, when, like rapid mill,"
3193,CANTO XXI,Upon its centre whirl’d the light; and then
3194,CANTO XXI,"The love, that did inhabit there, replied:"
3195,CANTO XXI,"“Splendour eternal, piercing through these folds,"
3196,CANTO XXI,"Its virtue to my vision knits, and thus"
3197,CANTO XXI,"Supported, lifts me so above myself,"
3198,CANTO XXI,"That on the sov’ran essence, which it wells from,"
3199,CANTO XXI,"I have the power to gaze: and hence the joy,"
3200,CANTO XXI,"Wherewith I sparkle, equaling with my blaze"
3201,CANTO XXI,"The keenness of my sight. But not the soul,"
3202,CANTO XXI,"That is in heav’n most lustrous, nor the seraph"
3203,CANTO XXI,"That hath his eyes most fix’d on God, shall solve"
3204,CANTO XXI,What thou hast ask’d: for in th’ abyss it lies
3205,CANTO XXI,"Of th’ everlasting statute sunk so low,"
3206,CANTO XXI,That no created ken may fathom it.
3207,CANTO XXI,"And, to the mortal world when thou return’st,"
3208,CANTO XXI,Be this reported; that none henceforth dare
3209,CANTO XXI,Direct his footsteps to so dread a bourn.
3210,CANTO XXI,"The mind, that here is radiant, on the earth"
3211,CANTO XXI,"Is wrapt in mist. Look then if she may do,"
3212,CANTO XXI,"Below, what passeth her ability,"
3213,CANTO XXI,When she is ta’en to heav’n.” By words like these
3214,CANTO XXI,"Admonish’d, I the question urg’d no more;"
3215,CANTO XXI,And of the spirit humbly sued alone
3216,CANTO XXI,T’ instruct me of its state. “’Twixt either shore
3217,CANTO XXI,"Of Italy, nor distant from thy land,"
3218,CANTO XXI,"A stony ridge ariseth, in such sort,"
3219,CANTO XXI,"The thunder doth not lift his voice so high,"
3220,CANTO XXI,They call it Catria: at whose foot a cell
3221,CANTO XXI,"Is sacred to the lonely Eremite,"
3222,CANTO XXI,For worship set apart and holy rites.”
3223,CANTO XXI,A third time thus it spake; then added: “There
3224,CANTO XXI,"So firmly to God’s service I adher’d,"
3225,CANTO XXI,That with no costlier viands than the juice
3226,CANTO XXI,"Of olives, easily I pass’d the heats"
3227,CANTO XXI,"Of summer and the winter frosts, content"
3228,CANTO XXI,In heav’n-ward musings. Rich were the returns
3229,CANTO XXI,"And fertile, which that cloister once was us’d"
3230,CANTO XXI,To render to these heavens: now ’tis fall’n
3231,CANTO XXI,"Into a waste so empty, that ere long"
3232,CANTO XXI,Detection must lay bare its vanity
3233,CANTO XXI,Pietro Damiano there was I yclept:
3234,CANTO XXI,"Pietro the sinner, when before I dwelt"
3235,CANTO XXI,"Beside the Adriatic, in the house"
3236,CANTO XXI,Of our blest Lady. Near upon my close
3237,CANTO XXI,"Of mortal life, through much importuning"
3238,CANTO XXI,I was constrain’d to wear the hat that still
3239,CANTO XXI,From bad to worse it shifted.—Cephas came;
3240,CANTO XXI,"He came, who was the Holy Spirit’s vessel,"
3241,CANTO XXI,"Barefoot and lean, eating their bread, as chanc’d,"
3242,CANTO XXI,At the first table. Modern Shepherd’s need
3243,CANTO XXI,"Those who on either hand may prop and lead them,"
3244,CANTO XXI,So burly are they grown: and from behind
3245,CANTO XXI,Others to hoist them. Down the palfrey’s sides
3246,CANTO XXI,"Spread their broad mantles, so as both the beasts"
3247,CANTO XXI,Are cover’d with one skin. O patience! thou
3248,CANTO XXI,That lookst on this and doth endure so long.”
3249,CANTO XXI,I at those accents saw the splendours down
3250,CANTO XXI,"From step to step alight, and wheel, and wax,"
3251,CANTO XXI,"Each circuiting, more beautiful. Round this"
3252,CANTO XXI,"They came, and stay’d them; uttered them a shout"
3253,CANTO XXI,"So loud, it hath no likeness here: nor I"
3254,CANTO XXI,"Wist what it spake, so deaf’ning was the thunder."
3255,CANTO XXI,
3256,CANTO XXI,
3257,CANTO XXI,
3258,CANTO XXI,
3259,CANTO XXII,CANTO XXII
3260,CANTO XXII,
3261,CANTO XXII,
3262,CANTO XXII,"Astounded, to the guardian of my steps"
3263,CANTO XXII,"I turn’d me, like the chill, who always runs"
3264,CANTO XXII,"Thither for succour, where he trusteth most,"
3265,CANTO XXII,"And she was like the mother, who her son"
3266,CANTO XXII,"Beholding pale and breathless, with her voice"
3267,CANTO XXII,"Soothes him, and he is cheer’d; for thus she spake,"
3268,CANTO XXII,"Soothing me: “Know’st not thou, thou art in heav’n?"
3269,CANTO XXII,"And know’st not thou, whatever is in heav’n,"
3270,CANTO XXII,"Is holy, and that nothing there is done"
3271,CANTO XXII,"But is done zealously and well? Deem now,"
3272,CANTO XXII,"What change in thee the song, and what my smile"
3273,CANTO XXII,"had wrought, since thus the shout had pow’r to move thee."
3274,CANTO XXII,"In which couldst thou have understood their prayers,"
3275,CANTO XXII,"The vengeance were already known to thee,"
3276,CANTO XXII,"Which thou must witness ere thy mortal hour,"
3277,CANTO XXII,"The sword of heav’n is not in haste to smite,"
3278,CANTO XXII,"Nor yet doth linger, save unto his seeming,"
3279,CANTO XXII,Who in desire or fear doth look for it.
3280,CANTO XXII,But elsewhere now l bid thee turn thy view;
3281,CANTO XXII,So shalt thou many a famous spirit behold.”
3282,CANTO XXII,"Mine eyes directing, as she will’d, I saw"
3283,CANTO XXII,"A hundred little spheres, that fairer grew"
3284,CANTO XXII,"By interchange of splendour. I remain’d,"
3285,CANTO XXII,"As one, who fearful of o’er-much presuming,"
3286,CANTO XXII,"Abates in him the keenness of desire,"
3287,CANTO XXII,"Nor dares to question, when amid those pearls,"
3288,CANTO XXII,"One largest and most lustrous onward drew,"
3289,CANTO XXII,That it might yield contentment to my wish;
3290,CANTO XXII,And from within it these the sounds I heard.
3291,CANTO XXII,
3292,CANTO XXII,"“If thou, like me, beheldst the charity"
3293,CANTO XXII,"That burns amongst us, what thy mind conceives,"
3294,CANTO XXII,"Were utter’d. But that, ere the lofty bound"
3295,CANTO XXII,"Thou reach, expectance may not weary thee,"
3296,CANTO XXII,"I will make answer even to the thought,"
3297,CANTO XXII,"Which thou hast such respect of. In old days,"
3298,CANTO XXII,"That mountain, at whose side Cassino rests,"
3299,CANTO XXII,Was on its height frequented by a race
3300,CANTO XXII,"Deceived and ill dispos’d: and I it was,"
3301,CANTO XXII,"Who thither carried first the name of Him,"
3302,CANTO XXII,Who brought the soul-subliming truth to man.
3303,CANTO XXII,"And such a speeding grace shone over me,"
3304,CANTO XXII,That from their impious worship I reclaim’d
3305,CANTO XXII,"The dwellers round about, who with the world"
3306,CANTO XXII,"Were in delusion lost. These other flames,"
3307,CANTO XXII,"The spirits of men contemplative, were all"
3308,CANTO XXII,"Enliven’d by that warmth, whose kindly force"
3309,CANTO XXII,Gives birth to flowers and fruits of holiness.
3310,CANTO XXII,Here is Macarius; Romoaldo here:
3311,CANTO XXII,"And here my brethren, who their steps refrain’d"
3312,CANTO XXII,"Within the cloisters, and held firm their heart.”"
3313,CANTO XXII,
3314,CANTO XXII,"I answ’ring, thus; “Thy gentle words and kind,"
3315,CANTO XXII,"And this the cheerful semblance, I behold"
3316,CANTO XXII,"Not unobservant, beaming in ye all,"
3317,CANTO XXII,"Have rais’d assurance in me, wakening it"
3318,CANTO XXII,"Full-blossom’d in my bosom, as a rose"
3319,CANTO XXII,"Before the sun, when the consummate flower"
3320,CANTO XXII,Has spread to utmost amplitude. Of thee
3321,CANTO XXII,"Therefore entreat I, father! to declare"
3322,CANTO XXII,"If I may gain such favour, as to gaze"
3323,CANTO XXII,"Upon thine image, by no covering veil’d.”"
3324,CANTO XXII,
3325,CANTO XXII,"“Brother!” he thus rejoin’d, “in the last sphere"
3326,CANTO XXII,"Expect completion of thy lofty aim,"
3327,CANTO XXII,"For there on each desire completion waits,"
3328,CANTO XXII,And there on mine: where every aim is found
3329,CANTO XXII,"Perfect, entire, and for fulfillment ripe."
3330,CANTO XXII,There all things are as they have ever been:
3331,CANTO XXII,"For space is none to bound, nor pole divides,"
3332,CANTO XXII,"Our ladder reaches even to that clime,"
3333,CANTO XXII,And so at giddy distance mocks thy view.
3334,CANTO XXII,Thither the Patriarch Jacob saw it stretch
3335,CANTO XXII,"Its topmost round, when it appear’d to him"
3336,CANTO XXII,With angels laden. But to mount it now
3337,CANTO XXII,None lifts his foot from earth: and hence my rule
3338,CANTO XXII,Is left a profitless stain upon the leaves;
3339,CANTO XXII,"The walls, for abbey rear’d, turned into dens,"
3340,CANTO XXII,The cowls to sacks choak’d up with musty meal.
3341,CANTO XXII,Foul usury doth not more lift itself
3342,CANTO XXII,"Against God’s pleasure, than that fruit which makes"
3343,CANTO XXII,The hearts of monks so wanton: for whate’er
3344,CANTO XXII,"Is in the church’s keeping, all pertains."
3345,CANTO XXII,"To such, as sue for heav’n’s sweet sake, and not"
3346,CANTO XXII,"To those who in respect of kindred claim,"
3347,CANTO XXII,Or on more vile allowance. Mortal flesh
3348,CANTO XXII,"Is grown so dainty, good beginnings last not"
3349,CANTO XXII,"From the oak’s birth, unto the acorn’s setting."
3350,CANTO XXII,His convent Peter founded without gold
3351,CANTO XXII,Or silver; I with pray’rs and fasting mine;
3352,CANTO XXII,And Francis his in meek humility.
3353,CANTO XXII,"And if thou note the point, whence each proceeds,"
3354,CANTO XXII,"Then look what it hath err’d to, thou shalt find"
3355,CANTO XXII,The white grown murky. Jordan was turn’d back;
3356,CANTO XXII,"And a less wonder, then the refluent sea,"
3357,CANTO XXII,May at God’s pleasure work amendment here.”
3358,CANTO XXII,
3359,CANTO XXII,"So saying, to his assembly back he drew:"
3360,CANTO XXII,"And they together cluster’d into one,"
3361,CANTO XXII,Then all roll’d upward like an eddying wind.
3362,CANTO XXII,
3363,CANTO XXII,The sweet dame beckon’d me to follow them:
3364,CANTO XXII,"And, by that influence only, so prevail’d"
3365,CANTO XXII,"Over my nature, that no natural motion,"
3366,CANTO XXII,"Ascending or descending here below,"
3367,CANTO XXII,"Had, as I mounted, with my pennon vied."
3368,CANTO XXII,
3369,CANTO XXII,"So, reader, as my hope is to return"
3370,CANTO XXII,"Unto the holy triumph, for the which"
3371,CANTO XXII,"I ofttimes wail my sins, and smite my breast,"
3372,CANTO XXII,Thou hadst been longer drawing out and thrusting
3373,CANTO XXII,"Thy finger in the fire, than I was, ere"
3374,CANTO XXII,"The sign, that followeth Taurus, I beheld,"
3375,CANTO XXII,And enter’d its precinct. O glorious stars!
3376,CANTO XXII,O light impregnate with exceeding virtue!
3377,CANTO XXII,To whom whate’er of genius lifteth me
3378,CANTO XXII,"Above the vulgar, grateful I refer;"
3379,CANTO XXII,With ye the parent of all mortal life
3380,CANTO XXII,"Arose and set, when I did first inhale"
3381,CANTO XXII,"The Tuscan air; and afterward, when grace"
3382,CANTO XXII,Vouchsaf’d me entrance to the lofty wheel
3383,CANTO XXII,"That in its orb impels ye, fate decreed"
3384,CANTO XXII,My passage at your clime. To you my soul
3385,CANTO XXII,"Devoutly sighs, for virtue even now"
3386,CANTO XXII,To meet the hard emprize that draws me on.
3387,CANTO XXII,
3388,CANTO XXII,"“Thou art so near the sum of blessedness,”"
3389,CANTO XXII,"Said Beatrice, “that behooves thy ken"
3390,CANTO XXII,"Be vigilant and clear. And, to this end,"
3391,CANTO XXII,"Or even thou advance thee further, hence"
3392,CANTO XXII,"Look downward, and contemplate, what a world"
3393,CANTO XXII,Already stretched under our feet there lies:
3394,CANTO XXII,"So as thy heart may, in its blithest mood,"
3395,CANTO XXII,"Present itself to the triumphal throng,"
3396,CANTO XXII,Which through the’ etherial concave comes rejoicing.”
3397,CANTO XXII,
3398,CANTO XXII,I straight obey’d; and with mine eye return’d
3399,CANTO XXII,"Through all the seven spheres, and saw this globe"
3400,CANTO XXII,"So pitiful of semblance, that perforce"
3401,CANTO XXII,It moved my smiles: and him in truth I hold
3402,CANTO XXII,"For wisest, who esteems it least: whose thoughts"
3403,CANTO XXII,"Elsewhere are fix’d, him worthiest call and best."
3404,CANTO XXII,I saw the daughter of Latona shine
3405,CANTO XXII,"Without the shadow, whereof late I deem’d"
3406,CANTO XXII,That dense and rare were cause. Here I sustain’d
3407,CANTO XXII,"The visage, Hyperion! of thy sun;"
3408,CANTO XXII,"And mark’d, how near him with their circle, round"
3409,CANTO XXII,Move Maia and Dione; here discern’d
3410,CANTO XXII,Jove’s tempering ’twixt his sire and son; and hence
3411,CANTO XXII,Their changes and their various aspects
3412,CANTO XXII,Distinctly scann’d. Nor might I not descry
3413,CANTO XXII,"Of all the seven, how bulky each, how swift;"
3414,CANTO XXII,Nor of their several distances not learn.
3415,CANTO XXII,This petty area (o’er the which we stride
3416,CANTO XXII,"So fiercely), as along the eternal twins"
3417,CANTO XXII,"I wound my way, appear’d before me all,"
3418,CANTO XXII,Forth from the havens stretch’d unto the hills.
3419,CANTO XXII,Then to the beauteous eyes mine eyes return’d.
3420,CANTO XXII,
3421,CANTO XXII,
3422,CANTO XXII,
3423,CANTO XXII,
3424,CANTO XXIII,CANTO XXIII
3425,CANTO XXIII,
3426,CANTO XXIII,
3427,CANTO XXIII,"E’en as the bird, who midst the leafy bower"
3428,CANTO XXIII,"Has, in her nest, sat darkling through the night,"
3429,CANTO XXIII,"With her sweet brood, impatient to descry"
3430,CANTO XXIII,"Their wished looks, and to bring home their food,"
3431,CANTO XXIII,In the fond quest unconscious of her toil:
3432,CANTO XXIII,"She, of the time prevenient, on the spray,"
3433,CANTO XXIII,"That overhangs their couch, with wakeful gaze"
3434,CANTO XXIII,"Expects the sun; nor ever, till the dawn,"
3435,CANTO XXIII,Removeth from the east her eager ken;
3436,CANTO XXIII,"So stood the dame erect, and bent her glance"
3437,CANTO XXIII,"Wistfully on that region, where the sun"
3438,CANTO XXIII,"Abateth most his speed; that, seeing her"
3439,CANTO XXIII,"Suspense and wand’ring, I became as one,"
3440,CANTO XXIII,"In whom desire is waken’d, and the hope"
3441,CANTO XXIII,Of somewhat new to come fills with delight.
3442,CANTO XXIII,
3443,CANTO XXIII,"Short space ensued; I was not held, I say,"
3444,CANTO XXIII,"Long in expectance, when I saw the heav’n"
3445,CANTO XXIII,"Wax more and more resplendent; and, “Behold,”"
3446,CANTO XXIII,"Cried Beatrice, “the triumphal hosts"
3447,CANTO XXIII,"Of Christ, and all the harvest reap’d at length"
3448,CANTO XXIII,"Of thy ascending up these spheres.” Meseem’d,"
3449,CANTO XXIII,"That, while she spake her image all did burn,"
3450,CANTO XXIII,"And in her eyes such fullness was of joy,"
3451,CANTO XXIII,And I am fain to pass unconstrued by.
3452,CANTO XXIII,
3453,CANTO XXIII,"As in the calm full moon, when Trivia smiles,"
3454,CANTO XXIII,"In peerless beauty, ’mid th’ eternal nympus,"
3455,CANTO XXIII,That paint through all its gulfs the blue profound
3456,CANTO XXIII,"In bright pre-eminence so saw I there,"
3457,CANTO XXIII,"O’er million lamps a sun, from whom all drew"
3458,CANTO XXIII,Their radiance as from ours the starry train:
3459,CANTO XXIII,And through the living light so lustrous glow’d
3460,CANTO XXIII,"The substance, that my ken endur’d it not."
3461,CANTO XXIII,
3462,CANTO XXIII,O Beatrice! sweet and precious guide!
3463,CANTO XXIII,Who cheer’d me with her comfortable words!
3464,CANTO XXIII,"“Against the virtue, that o’erpow’reth thee,"
3465,CANTO XXIII,"Avails not to resist. Here is the might,"
3466,CANTO XXIII,"And here the wisdom, which did open lay"
3467,CANTO XXIII,"The path, that had been yearned for so long,"
3468,CANTO XXIII,"Betwixt the heav’n and earth.” Like to the fire,"
3469,CANTO XXIII,"That, in a cloud imprison’d doth break out"
3470,CANTO XXIII,"Expansive, so that from its womb enlarg’d,"
3471,CANTO XXIII,It falleth against nature to the ground;
3472,CANTO XXIII,Thus in that heav’nly banqueting my soul
3473,CANTO XXIII,"Outgrew herself; and, in the transport lost."
3474,CANTO XXIII,Holds now remembrance none of what she was.
3475,CANTO XXIII,
3476,CANTO XXIII,"“Ope thou thine eyes, and mark me: thou hast seen"
3477,CANTO XXIII,"Things, that empower thee to sustain my smile.”"
3478,CANTO XXIII,
3479,CANTO XXIII,"I was as one, when a forgotten dream"
3480,CANTO XXIII,"Doth come across him, and he strives in vain"
3481,CANTO XXIII,"To shape it in his fantasy again,"
3482,CANTO XXIII,"Whenas that gracious boon was proffer’d me,"
3483,CANTO XXIII,"Which never may be cancel’d from the book,"
3484,CANTO XXIII,Wherein the past is written. Now were all
3485,CANTO XXIII,"Those tongues to sound, that have on sweetest milk"
3486,CANTO XXIII,Of Polyhymnia and her sisters fed
3487,CANTO XXIII,"And fatten’d, not with all their help to boot,"
3488,CANTO XXIII,"Unto the thousandth parcel of the truth,"
3489,CANTO XXIII,"My song might shadow forth that saintly smile,"
3490,CANTO XXIII,flow merely in her saintly looks it wrought.
3491,CANTO XXIII,And with such figuring of Paradise
3492,CANTO XXIII,"The sacred strain must leap, like one, that meets"
3493,CANTO XXIII,A sudden interruption to his road.
3494,CANTO XXIII,"But he, who thinks how ponderous the theme,"
3495,CANTO XXIII,"And that ’tis lain upon a mortal shoulder,"
3496,CANTO XXIII,"May pardon, if it tremble with the burden."
3497,CANTO XXIII,"The track, our ventrous keel must furrow, brooks"
3498,CANTO XXIII,"No unribb’d pinnace, no self-sparing pilot."
3499,CANTO XXIII,
3500,CANTO XXIII,"“Why doth my face,” said Beatrice, “thus"
3501,CANTO XXIII,"Enamour thee, as that thou dost not turn"
3502,CANTO XXIII,"Unto the beautiful garden, blossoming"
3503,CANTO XXIII,"Beneath the rays of Christ? Here is the rose,"
3504,CANTO XXIII,Wherein the word divine was made incarnate;
3505,CANTO XXIII,"And here the lilies, by whose odour known"
3506,CANTO XXIII,The way of life was follow’d.” Prompt I heard
3507,CANTO XXIII,"Her bidding, and encounter once again"
3508,CANTO XXIII,"The strife of aching vision. As erewhile,"
3509,CANTO XXIII,"Through glance of sunlight, stream’d through broken cloud,"
3510,CANTO XXIII,"Mine eyes a flower-besprinkled mead have seen,"
3511,CANTO XXIII,Though veil’d themselves in shade; so saw I there
3512,CANTO XXIII,"Legions of splendours, on whom burning rays"
3513,CANTO XXIII,"Shed lightnings from above, yet saw I not"
3514,CANTO XXIII,The fountain whence they flow’d. O gracious virtue!
3515,CANTO XXIII,"Thou, whose broad stamp is on them, higher up"
3516,CANTO XXIII,Thou didst exalt thy glory to give room
3517,CANTO XXIII,To my o’erlabour’d sight: when at the name
3518,CANTO XXIII,"Of that fair flower, whom duly I invoke"
3519,CANTO XXIII,"Both morn and eve, my soul, with all her might"
3520,CANTO XXIII,"Collected, on the goodliest ardour fix’d."
3521,CANTO XXIII,"And, as the bright dimensions of the star"
3522,CANTO XXIII,"In heav’n excelling, as once here on earth"
3523,CANTO XXIII,"Were, in my eyeballs lively portray’d,"
3524,CANTO XXIII,"Lo! from within the sky a cresset fell,"
3525,CANTO XXIII,"Circling in fashion of a diadem,"
3526,CANTO XXIII,"And girt the star, and hov’ring round it wheel’d."
3527,CANTO XXIII,
3528,CANTO XXIII,"Whatever melody sounds sweetest here,"
3529,CANTO XXIII,"And draws the spirit most unto itself,"
3530,CANTO XXIII,"Might seem a rent cloud when it grates the thunder,"
3531,CANTO XXIII,"Compar’d unto the sounding of that lyre,"
3532,CANTO XXIII,"Wherewith the goodliest sapphire, that inlays"
3533,CANTO XXIII,"The floor of heav’n, was crown’d. “Angelic Love"
3534,CANTO XXIII,"I am, who thus with hov’ring flight enwheel"
3535,CANTO XXIII,"The lofty rapture from that womb inspir’d,"
3536,CANTO XXIII,"Where our desire did dwell: and round thee so,"
3537,CANTO XXIII,Lady of Heav’n! will hover; long as thou
3538,CANTO XXIII,"Thy Son shalt follow, and diviner joy"
3539,CANTO XXIII,Shall from thy presence gild the highest sphere.”
3540,CANTO XXIII,
3541,CANTO XXIII,Such close was to the circling melody:
3542,CANTO XXIII,"And, as it ended, all the other lights"
3543,CANTO XXIII,"Took up the strain, and echoed Mary’s name."
3544,CANTO XXIII,
3545,CANTO XXIII,"The robe, that with its regal folds enwraps"
3546,CANTO XXIII,"The world, and with the nearer breath of God"
3547,CANTO XXIII,"Doth burn and quiver, held so far retir’d"
3548,CANTO XXIII,"Its inner hem and skirting over us,"
3549,CANTO XXIII,That yet no glimmer of its majesty
3550,CANTO XXIII,Had stream’d unto me: therefore were mine eyes
3551,CANTO XXIII,"Unequal to pursue the crowned flame,"
3552,CANTO XXIII,That rose and sought its natal seed of fire;
3553,CANTO XXIII,"And like to babe, that stretches forth its arms"
3554,CANTO XXIII,"For very eagerness towards the breast,"
3555,CANTO XXIII,After the milk is taken; so outstretch’d
3556,CANTO XXIII,"Their wavy summits all the fervent band,"
3557,CANTO XXIII,Through zealous love to Mary: then in view
3558,CANTO XXIII,"There halted, and “Regina Coeli” sang"
3559,CANTO XXIII,"So sweetly, the delight hath left me never."
3560,CANTO XXIII,
3561,CANTO XXIII,O what o’erflowing plenty is up-pil’d
3562,CANTO XXIII,"In those rich-laden coffers, which below"
3563,CANTO XXIII,"Sow’d the good seed, whose harvest now they keep."
3564,CANTO XXIII,
3565,CANTO XXIII,"Here are the treasures tasted, that with tears"
3566,CANTO XXIII,"Were in the Babylonian exile won,"
3567,CANTO XXIII,When gold had fail’d them. Here in synod high
3568,CANTO XXIII,"Of ancient council with the new conven’d,"
3569,CANTO XXIII,"Under the Son of Mary and of God,"
3570,CANTO XXIII,"Victorious he his mighty triumph holds,"
3571,CANTO XXIII,To whom the keys of glory were assign’d.
3572,CANTO XXIII,
3573,CANTO XXIII,
3574,CANTO XXIII,
3575,CANTO XXIII,
3576,CANTO XXIV,CANTO XXIV
3577,CANTO XXIV,
3578,CANTO XXIV,
3579,CANTO XXIV,“O ye! in chosen fellowship advanc’d
3580,CANTO XXIV,"To the great supper of the blessed Lamb,"
3581,CANTO XXIV,Whereon who feeds hath every wish fulfill’d!
3582,CANTO XXIV,If to this man through God’s grace be vouchsaf’d
3583,CANTO XXIV,"Foretaste of that, which from your table falls,"
3584,CANTO XXIV,Or ever death his fated term prescribe;
3585,CANTO XXIV,Be ye not heedless of his urgent will;
3586,CANTO XXIV,But may some influence of your sacred dews
3587,CANTO XXIV,"Sprinkle him. Of the fount ye alway drink,"
3588,CANTO XXIV,"Whence flows what most he craves.” Beatrice spake,"
3589,CANTO XXIV,"And the rejoicing spirits, like to spheres"
3590,CANTO XXIV,"On firm-set poles revolving, trail’d a blaze"
3591,CANTO XXIV,"Of comet splendour; and as wheels, that wind"
3592,CANTO XXIV,"Their circles in the horologe, so work"
3593,CANTO XXIV,"The stated rounds, that to th’ observant eye"
3594,CANTO XXIV,"The first seems still, and, as it flew, the last;"
3595,CANTO XXIV,"E’en thus their carols weaving variously,"
3596,CANTO XXIV,"They by the measure pac’d, or swift, or slow,"
3597,CANTO XXIV,Made me to rate the riches of their joy.
3598,CANTO XXIV,
3599,CANTO XXIV,"From that, which I did note in beauty most"
3600,CANTO XXIV,"Excelling, saw I issue forth a flame"
3601,CANTO XXIV,"So bright, as none was left more goodly there."
3602,CANTO XXIV,"Round Beatrice thrice it wheel’d about,"
3603,CANTO XXIV,"With so divine a song, that fancy’s ear"
3604,CANTO XXIV,Records it not; and the pen passeth on
3605,CANTO XXIV,"And leaves a blank: for that our mortal speech,"
3606,CANTO XXIV,"Nor e’en the inward shaping of the brain,"
3607,CANTO XXIV,Hath colours fine enough to trace such folds.
3608,CANTO XXIV,
3609,CANTO XXIV,“O saintly sister mine! thy prayer devout
3610,CANTO XXIV,"Is with so vehement affection urg’d,"
3611,CANTO XXIV,Thou dost unbind me from that beauteous sphere.”
3612,CANTO XXIV,
3613,CANTO XXIV,Such were the accents towards my lady breath’d
3614,CANTO XXIV,"From that blest ardour, soon as it was stay’d:"
3615,CANTO XXIV,To whom she thus: “O everlasting light
3616,CANTO XXIV,"Of him, within whose mighty grasp our Lord"
3617,CANTO XXIV,"Did leave the keys, which of this wondrous bliss"
3618,CANTO XXIV,"He bare below! tent this man, as thou wilt,"
3619,CANTO XXIV,"With lighter probe or deep, touching the faith,"
3620,CANTO XXIV,By the which thou didst on the billows walk.
3621,CANTO XXIV,"If he in love, in hope, and in belief,"
3622,CANTO XXIV,"Be steadfast, is not hid from thee: for thou"
3623,CANTO XXIV,"Hast there thy ken, where all things are beheld"
3624,CANTO XXIV,In liveliest portraiture. But since true faith
3625,CANTO XXIV,"Has peopled this fair realm with citizens,"
3626,CANTO XXIV,"Meet is, that to exalt its glory more,"
3627,CANTO XXIV,Thou in his audience shouldst thereof discourse.”
3628,CANTO XXIV,
3629,CANTO XXIV,"Like to the bachelor, who arms himself,"
3630,CANTO XXIV,"And speaks not, till the master have propos’d"
3631,CANTO XXIV,"The question, to approve, and not to end it;"
3632,CANTO XXIV,"So I, in silence, arm’d me, while she spake,"
3633,CANTO XXIV,Summoning up each argument to aid;
3634,CANTO XXIV,"As was behooveful for such questioner,"
3635,CANTO XXIV,"And such profession: “As good Christian ought,"
3636,CANTO XXIV,"Declare thee, What is faith?” Whereat I rais’d"
3637,CANTO XXIV,"My forehead to the light, whence this had breath’d,"
3638,CANTO XXIV,"Then turn’d to Beatrice, and in her looks"
3639,CANTO XXIV,"Approval met, that from their inmost fount"
3640,CANTO XXIV,"I should unlock the waters. “May the grace,"
3641,CANTO XXIV,That giveth me the captain of the church
3642,CANTO XXIV,"For confessor,” said I, “vouchsafe to me"
3643,CANTO XXIV,Apt utterance for my thoughts!” then added: “Sire!
3644,CANTO XXIV,E’en as set down by the unerring style
3645,CANTO XXIV,"Of thy dear brother, who with thee conspir’d"
3646,CANTO XXIV,"To bring Rome in unto the way of life,"
3647,CANTO XXIV,"Faith of things hop’d is substance, and the proof"
3648,CANTO XXIV,Of things not seen; and herein doth consist
3649,CANTO XXIV,"Methinks its essence,”—“Rightly hast thou deem’d,”"
3650,CANTO XXIV,"Was answer’d: “if thou well discern, why first"
3651,CANTO XXIV,"He hath defin’d it, substance, and then proof.”"
3652,CANTO XXIV,
3653,CANTO XXIV,"“The deep things,” I replied, “which here I scan"
3654,CANTO XXIV,"Distinctly, are below from mortal eye"
3655,CANTO XXIV,"So hidden, they have in belief alone"
3656,CANTO XXIV,"Their being, on which credence hope sublime"
3657,CANTO XXIV,Is built; and therefore substance it intends.
3658,CANTO XXIV,And inasmuch as we must needs infer
3659,CANTO XXIV,"From such belief our reasoning, all respect"
3660,CANTO XXIV,"To other view excluded, hence of proof"
3661,CANTO XXIV,Th’ intention is deriv’d.” Forthwith I heard:
3662,CANTO XXIV,"“If thus, whate’er by learning men attain,"
3663,CANTO XXIV,"Were understood, the sophist would want room"
3664,CANTO XXIV,To exercise his wit.” So breath’d the flame
3665,CANTO XXIV,Of love: then added: “Current is the coin
3666,CANTO XXIV,"Thou utter’st, both in weight and in alloy."
3667,CANTO XXIV,"But tell me, if thou hast it in thy purse.”"
3668,CANTO XXIV,
3669,CANTO XXIV,"“Even so glittering and so round,” said I,"
3670,CANTO XXIV,“I not a whit misdoubt of its assay.”
3671,CANTO XXIV,
3672,CANTO XXIV,Next issued from the deep imbosom’d splendour:
3673,CANTO XXIV,"“Say, whence the costly jewel, on the which"
3674,CANTO XXIV,"Is founded every virtue, came to thee.”"
3675,CANTO XXIV,"“The flood,” I answer’d, “from the Spirit of God"
3676,CANTO XXIV,"Rain’d down upon the ancient bond and new,—"
3677,CANTO XXIV,"Here is the reas’ning, that convinceth me"
3678,CANTO XXIV,"So feelingly, each argument beside"
3679,CANTO XXIV,Seems blunt and forceless in comparison.”
3680,CANTO XXIV,"Then heard I: “Wherefore holdest thou that each,"
3681,CANTO XXIV,"The elder proposition and the new,"
3682,CANTO XXIV,"Which so persuade thee, are the voice of heav’n?”"
3683,CANTO XXIV,
3684,CANTO XXIV,"“The works, that follow’d, evidence their truth;”"
3685,CANTO XXIV,I answer’d: “Nature did not make for these
3686,CANTO XXIV,"The iron hot, or on her anvil mould them.”"
3687,CANTO XXIV,"“Who voucheth to thee of the works themselves,”"
3688,CANTO XXIV,"Was the reply, “that they in very deed"
3689,CANTO XXIV,Are that they purport? None hath sworn so to thee.”
3690,CANTO XXIV,
3691,CANTO XXIV,"“That all the world,” said I, “should have been turn’d"
3692,CANTO XXIV,"To Christian, and no miracle been wrought,"
3693,CANTO XXIV,"Would in itself be such a miracle,"
3694,CANTO XXIV,The rest were not an hundredth part so great.
3695,CANTO XXIV,E’en thou wentst forth in poverty and hunger
3696,CANTO XXIV,"To set the goodly plant, that from the vine,"
3697,CANTO XXIV,"It once was, now is grown unsightly bramble.”"
3698,CANTO XXIV,"That ended, through the high celestial court"
3699,CANTO XXIV,Resounded all the spheres. “Praise we one God!”
3700,CANTO XXIV,In song of most unearthly melody.
3701,CANTO XXIV,"And when that Worthy thus, from branch to branch,"
3702,CANTO XXIV,"Examining, had led me, that we now"
3703,CANTO XXIV,"Approach’d the topmost bough, he straight resum’d;"
3704,CANTO XXIV,"“The grace, that holds sweet dalliance with thy soul,"
3705,CANTO XXIV,So far discreetly hath thy lips unclos’d
3706,CANTO XXIV,"That, whatsoe’er has past them, I commend."
3707,CANTO XXIV,"Behooves thee to express, what thou believ’st,"
3708,CANTO XXIV,"The next, and whereon thy belief hath grown.”"
3709,CANTO XXIV,
3710,CANTO XXIV,"“O saintly sire and spirit!” I began,"
3711,CANTO XXIV,"“Who seest that, which thou didst so believe,"
3712,CANTO XXIV,"As to outstrip feet younger than thine own,"
3713,CANTO XXIV,"Toward the sepulchre? thy will is here,"
3714,CANTO XXIV,That I the tenour of my creed unfold;
3715,CANTO XXIV,And thou the cause of it hast likewise ask’d.
3716,CANTO XXIV,"And I reply: I in one God believe,"
3717,CANTO XXIV,"One sole eternal Godhead, of whose love"
3718,CANTO XXIV,"All heav’n is mov’d, himself unmov’d the while."
3719,CANTO XXIV,"Nor demonstration physical alone,"
3720,CANTO XXIV,"Or more intelligential and abstruse,"
3721,CANTO XXIV,Persuades me to this faith; but from that truth
3722,CANTO XXIV,"It cometh to me rather, which is shed"
3723,CANTO XXIV,"Through Moses, the rapt Prophets, and the Psalms."
3724,CANTO XXIV,"The Gospel, and that ye yourselves did write,"
3725,CANTO XXIV,When ye were gifted of the Holy Ghost.
3726,CANTO XXIV,"In three eternal Persons I believe,"
3727,CANTO XXIV,"Essence threefold and one, mysterious league"
3728,CANTO XXIV,"Of union absolute, which, many a time,"
3729,CANTO XXIV,The word of gospel lore upon my mind
3730,CANTO XXIV,"Imprints: and from this germ, this firstling spark,"
3731,CANTO XXIV,"The lively flame dilates, and like heav’n’s star"
3732,CANTO XXIV,"Doth glitter in me.” As the master hears,"
3733,CANTO XXIV,"Well pleas’d, and then enfoldeth in his arms"
3734,CANTO XXIV,"The servant, who hath joyful tidings brought,"
3735,CANTO XXIV,And having told the errand keeps his peace;
3736,CANTO XXIV,Thus benediction uttering with song
3737,CANTO XXIV,"Soon as my peace I held, compass’d me thrice"
3738,CANTO XXIV,"The apostolic radiance, whose behest"
3739,CANTO XXIV,Had op’d lips; so well their answer pleas’d.
3740,CANTO XXIV,
3741,CANTO XXIV,
3742,CANTO XXIV,
3743,CANTO XXIV,
3744,CANTO XXV,CANTO XXV
3745,CANTO XXV,
3746,CANTO XXV,
3747,CANTO XXV,If e’er the sacred poem that hath made
3748,CANTO XXV,"Both heav’n and earth copartners in its toil,"
3749,CANTO XXV,"And with lean abstinence, through many a year,"
3750,CANTO XXV,"Faded my brow, be destin’d to prevail"
3751,CANTO XXV,"Over the cruelty, which bars me forth"
3752,CANTO XXV,"Of the fair sheep-fold, where a sleeping lamb"
3753,CANTO XXV,"The wolves set on and fain had worried me,"
3754,CANTO XXV,With other voice and fleece of other grain
3755,CANTO XXV,"I shall forthwith return, and, standing up"
3756,CANTO XXV,"At my baptismal font, shall claim the wreath"
3757,CANTO XXV,Due to the poet’s temples: for I there
3758,CANTO XXV,First enter’d on the faith which maketh souls
3759,CANTO XXV,"Acceptable to God: and, for its sake,"
3760,CANTO XXV,Peter had then circled my forehead thus.
3761,CANTO XXV,
3762,CANTO XXV,"Next from the squadron, whence had issued forth"
3763,CANTO XXV,"The first fruit of Christ’s vicars on the earth,"
3764,CANTO XXV,"Toward us mov’d a light, at view whereof"
3765,CANTO XXV,"My Lady, full of gladness, spake to me:"
3766,CANTO XXV,"“Lo! lo! behold the peer of mickle might,"
3767,CANTO XXV,That makes Falicia throng’d with visitants!”
3768,CANTO XXV,
3769,CANTO XXV,"As when the ring-dove by his mate alights,"
3770,CANTO XXV,"In circles each about the other wheels,"
3771,CANTO XXV,And murmuring cooes his fondness; thus saw I
3772,CANTO XXV,"One, of the other great and glorious prince,"
3773,CANTO XXV,"With kindly greeting hail’d, extolling both"
3774,CANTO XXV,Their heavenly banqueting; but when an end
3775,CANTO XXV,"Was to their gratulation, silent, each,"
3776,CANTO XXV,"Before me sat they down, so burning bright,"
3777,CANTO XXV,"I could not look upon them. Smiling then,"
3778,CANTO XXV,Beatrice spake: “O life in glory shrin’d!”
3779,CANTO XXV,Who didst the largess of our kingly court
3780,CANTO XXV,Set down with faithful pen! let now thy voice
3781,CANTO XXV,Of hope the praises in this height resound.
3782,CANTO XXV,"For thou, who figur’st them in shapes, as clear,"
3783,CANTO XXV,"As Jesus stood before thee, well can’st speak them.”"
3784,CANTO XXV,
3785,CANTO XXV,"“Lift up thy head, and be thou strong in trust:"
3786,CANTO XXV,"For that, which hither from the mortal world"
3787,CANTO XXV,"Arriveth, must be ripen’d in our beam.”"
3788,CANTO XXV,
3789,CANTO XXV,Such cheering accents from the second flame
3790,CANTO XXV,Assur’d me; and mine eyes I lifted up
3791,CANTO XXV,Unto the mountains that had bow’d them late
3792,CANTO XXV,With over-heavy burden. “Sith our Liege
3793,CANTO XXV,"Wills of his grace that thou, or ere thy death,"
3794,CANTO XXV,"In the most secret council, with his lords"
3795,CANTO XXV,"Shouldst be confronted, so that having view’d"
3796,CANTO XXV,"The glories of our court, thou mayst therewith"
3797,CANTO XXV,"Thyself, and all who hear, invigorate"
3798,CANTO XXV,"With hope, that leads to blissful end; declare,"
3799,CANTO XXV,"What is that hope, how it doth flourish in thee,"
3800,CANTO XXV,"And whence thou hadst it?” Thus proceeding still,"
3801,CANTO XXV,"The second light: and she, whose gentle love"
3802,CANTO XXV,My soaring pennons in that lofty flight
3803,CANTO XXV,"Escorted, thus preventing me, rejoin’d:"
3804,CANTO XXV,"Among her sons, not one more full of hope,"
3805,CANTO XXV,Hath the church militant: so ’tis of him
3806,CANTO XXV,"Recorded in the sun, whose liberal orb"
3807,CANTO XXV,Enlighteneth all our tribe: and ere his term
3808,CANTO XXV,"Of warfare, hence permitted he is come,"
3809,CANTO XXV,"From Egypt to Jerusalem, to see."
3810,CANTO XXV,"The other points, both which thou hast inquir’d,"
3811,CANTO XXV,"Not for more knowledge, but that he may tell"
3812,CANTO XXV,"How dear thou holdst the virtue, these to him"
3813,CANTO XXV,"Leave I; for he may answer thee with ease,"
3814,CANTO XXV,"And without boasting, so God give him grace.”"
3815,CANTO XXV,"Like to the scholar, practis’d in his task,"
3816,CANTO XXV,"Who, willing to give proof of diligence,"
3817,CANTO XXV,"Seconds his teacher gladly, “Hope,” said I,"
3818,CANTO XXV,"“Is of the joy to come a sure expectance,"
3819,CANTO XXV,Th’ effect of grace divine and merit preceding.
3820,CANTO XXV,"This light from many a star visits my heart,"
3821,CANTO XXV,"But flow’d to me the first from him, who sang"
3822,CANTO XXV,"The songs of the Supreme, himself supreme"
3823,CANTO XXV,Among his tuneful brethren. ‘Let all hope
3824,CANTO XXV,"In thee,’ so speak his anthem, ‘who have known"
3825,CANTO XXV,Thy name;’ and with my faith who know not that?
3826,CANTO XXV,"From thee, the next, distilling from his spring,"
3827,CANTO XXV,"In thine epistle, fell on me the drops"
3828,CANTO XXV,"So plenteously, that I on others shower"
3829,CANTO XXV,"The influence of their dew.” Whileas I spake,"
3830,CANTO XXV,"A lamping, as of quick and vollied lightning,"
3831,CANTO XXV,"Within the bosom of that mighty sheen,"
3832,CANTO XXV,Play’d tremulous; then forth these accents breath’d:
3833,CANTO XXV,“Love for the virtue which attended me
3834,CANTO XXV,"E’en to the palm, and issuing from the field,"
3835,CANTO XXV,"Glows vigorous yet within me, and inspires"
3836,CANTO XXV,"To ask of thee, whom also it delights;"
3837,CANTO XXV,What promise thou from hope in chief dost win.”
3838,CANTO XXV,
3839,CANTO XXV,"“Both scriptures, new and ancient,” I reply’d;"
3840,CANTO XXV,“Propose the mark (which even now I view)
3841,CANTO XXV,"For souls belov’d of God. Isaias saith,"
3842,CANTO XXV,"That, in their own land, each one must be clad"
3843,CANTO XXV,In twofold vesture; and their proper lands this delicious life.
3844,CANTO XXV,"In terms more full,"
3845,CANTO XXV,"And clearer far, thy brother hath set forth"
3846,CANTO XXV,"This revelation to us, where he tells"
3847,CANTO XXV,Of the white raiment destin’d to the saints.”
3848,CANTO XXV,"And, as the words were ending, from above,"
3849,CANTO XXV,"“They hope in thee,” first heard we cried: whereto"
3850,CANTO XXV,"Answer’d the carols all. Amidst them next,"
3851,CANTO XXV,"A light of so clear amplitude emerg’d,"
3852,CANTO XXV,"That winter’s month were but a single day,"
3853,CANTO XXV,Were such a crystal in the Cancer’s sign.
3854,CANTO XXV,
3855,CANTO XXV,"Like as a virgin riseth up, and goes,"
3856,CANTO XXV,"And enters on the mazes of the dance,"
3857,CANTO XXV,"Though gay, yet innocent of worse intent,"
3858,CANTO XXV,Than to do fitting honour to the bride;
3859,CANTO XXV,So I beheld the new effulgence come
3860,CANTO XXV,"Unto the other two, who in a ring"
3861,CANTO XXV,"Wheel’d, as became their rapture. In the dance"
3862,CANTO XXV,And in the song it mingled. And the dame
3863,CANTO XXV,Held on them fix’d her looks: e’en as the spouse
3864,CANTO XXV,"Silent and moveless. “This is he, who lay"
3865,CANTO XXV,Upon the bosom of our pelican:
3866,CANTO XXV,"This he, into whose keeping from the cross"
3867,CANTO XXV,"The mighty charge was given.” Thus she spake,"
3868,CANTO XXV,Yet therefore naught the more remov’d her Sight
3869,CANTO XXV,"From marking them, or ere her words began,"
3870,CANTO XXV,"Or when they clos’d. As he, who looks intent,"
3871,CANTO XXV,"And strives with searching ken, how he may see"
3872,CANTO XXV,"The sun in his eclipse, and, through desire"
3873,CANTO XXV,"Of seeing, loseth power of sight: so I"
3874,CANTO XXV,"Peer’d on that last resplendence, while I heard:"
3875,CANTO XXV,"“Why dazzlest thou thine eyes in seeking that,"
3876,CANTO XXV,"Which here abides not? Earth my body is,"
3877,CANTO XXV,"In earth: and shall be, with the rest, so long,"
3878,CANTO XXV,As till our number equal the decree
3879,CANTO XXV,"Of the Most High. The two that have ascended,"
3880,CANTO XXV,"In this our blessed cloister, shine alone"
3881,CANTO XXV,With the two garments. So report below.”
3882,CANTO XXV,
3883,CANTO XXV,"As when, for ease of labour, or to shun"
3884,CANTO XXV,"Suspected peril at a whistle’s breath,"
3885,CANTO XXV,"The oars, erewhile dash’d frequent in the wave,"
3886,CANTO XXV,All rest; the flamy circle at that voice
3887,CANTO XXV,"So rested, and the mingling sound was still,"
3888,CANTO XXV,Which from the trinal band soft-breathing rose.
3889,CANTO XXV,"I turn’d, but ah! how trembled in my thought,"
3890,CANTO XXV,"When, looking at my side again to see"
3891,CANTO XXV,"Beatrice, I descried her not, although"
3892,CANTO XXV,"Not distant, on the happy coast she stood."
3893,CANTO XXV,
3894,CANTO XXV,
3895,CANTO XXV,
3896,CANTO XXV,
3897,CANTO XXVI,CANTO XXVI
3898,CANTO XXVI,
3899,CANTO XXVI,
3900,CANTO XXVI,"With dazzled eyes, whilst wond’ring I remain’d,"
3901,CANTO XXVI,"Forth of the beamy flame which dazzled me,"
3902,CANTO XXVI,"Issued a breath, that in attention mute"
3903,CANTO XXVI,"Detain’d me; and these words it spake: “’Twere well,"
3904,CANTO XXVI,"That, long as till thy vision, on my form"
3905,CANTO XXVI,"O’erspent, regain its virtue, with discourse"
3906,CANTO XXVI,"Thou compensate the brief delay. Say then,"
3907,CANTO XXVI,"Beginning, to what point thy soul aspires:"
3908,CANTO XXVI,
3909,CANTO XXVI,"“And meanwhile rest assur’d, that sight in thee"
3910,CANTO XXVI,"Is but o’erpowered a space, not wholly quench’d:"
3911,CANTO XXVI,"Since thy fair guide and lovely, in her look"
3912,CANTO XXVI,"Hath potency, the like to that which dwelt"
3913,CANTO XXVI,In Ananias’ hand.” I answering thus:
3914,CANTO XXVI,“Be to mine eyes the remedy or late
3915,CANTO XXVI,"Or early, at her pleasure; for they were"
3916,CANTO XXVI,"The gates, at which she enter’d, and did light"
3917,CANTO XXVI,Her never dying fire. My wishes here
3918,CANTO XXVI,"Are centered; in this palace is the weal,"
3919,CANTO XXVI,"That Alpha and Omega, is to all"
3920,CANTO XXVI,The lessons love can read me.” Yet again
3921,CANTO XXVI,"The voice which had dispers’d my fear, when daz’d"
3922,CANTO XXVI,"With that excess, to converse urg’d, and spake:"
3923,CANTO XXVI,"“Behooves thee sift more narrowly thy terms,"
3924,CANTO XXVI,"And say, who level’d at this scope thy bow.”"
3925,CANTO XXVI,
3926,CANTO XXVI,"“Philosophy,” said I, “hath arguments,"
3927,CANTO XXVI,And this place hath authority enough
3928,CANTO XXVI,"T’ imprint in me such love: for, of constraint,"
3929,CANTO XXVI,"Good, inasmuch as we perceive the good,"
3930,CANTO XXVI,"Kindles our love, and in degree the more,"
3931,CANTO XXVI,As it comprises more of goodness in ’t.
3932,CANTO XXVI,"The essence then, where such advantage is,"
3933,CANTO XXVI,"That each good, found without it, is naught else"
3934,CANTO XXVI,"But of his light the beam, must needs attract"
3935,CANTO XXVI,"The soul of each one, loving, who the truth"
3936,CANTO XXVI,"Discerns, on which this proof is built. Such truth"
3937,CANTO XXVI,"Learn I from him, who shows me the first love"
3938,CANTO XXVI,Of all intelligential substances
3939,CANTO XXVI,"Eternal: from his voice I learn, whose word"
3940,CANTO XXVI,"Is truth, that of himself to Moses saith,"
3941,CANTO XXVI,‘I will make all my good before thee pass.’
3942,CANTO XXVI,"Lastly from thee I learn, who chief proclaim’st,"
3943,CANTO XXVI,"E’en at the outset of thy heralding,"
3944,CANTO XXVI,In mortal ears the mystery of heav’n.”
3945,CANTO XXVI,
3946,CANTO XXVI,"“Through human wisdom, and th’ authority"
3947,CANTO XXVI,"Therewith agreeing,” heard I answer’d, “keep"
3948,CANTO XXVI,"The choicest of thy love for God. But say,"
3949,CANTO XXVI,If thou yet other cords within thee feel’st
3950,CANTO XXVI,That draw thee towards him; so that thou report
3951,CANTO XXVI,"How many are the fangs, with which this love"
3952,CANTO XXVI,"Is grappled to thy soul.” I did not miss,"
3953,CANTO XXVI,To what intent the eagle of our Lord
3954,CANTO XXVI,Had pointed his demand; yea noted well
3955,CANTO XXVI,"Th’ avowal, which he led to; and resum’d:"
3956,CANTO XXVI,"“All grappling bonds, that knit the heart to God,"
3957,CANTO XXVI,Confederate to make fast our clarity.
3958,CANTO XXVI,"The being of the world, and mine own being,"
3959,CANTO XXVI,"The death which he endur’d that I should live,"
3960,CANTO XXVI,"And that, which all the faithful hope, as I do,"
3961,CANTO XXVI,"To the foremention’d lively knowledge join’d,"
3962,CANTO XXVI,"Have from the sea of ill love sav’d my bark,"
3963,CANTO XXVI,And on the coast secur’d it of the right.
3964,CANTO XXVI,"As for the leaves, that in the garden bloom,"
3965,CANTO XXVI,"My love for them is great, as is the good"
3966,CANTO XXVI,"Dealt by th’ eternal hand, that tends them all.”"
3967,CANTO XXVI,
3968,CANTO XXVI,"I ended, and therewith a song most sweet"
3969,CANTO XXVI,"Rang through the spheres; and “Holy, holy, holy,”"
3970,CANTO XXVI,Accordant with the rest my lady sang.
3971,CANTO XXVI,And as a sleep is broken and dispers’d
3972,CANTO XXVI,"Through sharp encounter of the nimble light,"
3973,CANTO XXVI,With the eye’s spirit running forth to meet
3974,CANTO XXVI,"The ray, from membrane on to the membrane urg’d;"
3975,CANTO XXVI,And the upstartled wight loathes that he sees;
3976,CANTO XXVI,"So, at his sudden waking, he misdeems"
3977,CANTO XXVI,"Of all around him, till assurance waits"
3978,CANTO XXVI,On better judgment: thus the saintly came
3979,CANTO XXVI,"Drove from before mine eyes the motes away,"
3980,CANTO XXVI,"With the resplendence of her own, that cast"
3981,CANTO XXVI,"Their brightness downward, thousand miles below."
3982,CANTO XXVI,"Whence I my vision, clearer shall before,"
3983,CANTO XXVI,"Recover’d; and, well nigh astounded, ask’d"
3984,CANTO XXVI,"Of a fourth light, that now with us I saw."
3985,CANTO XXVI,
3986,CANTO XXVI,"And Beatrice: “The first diving soul,"
3987,CANTO XXVI,"That ever the first virtue fram’d, admires"
3988,CANTO XXVI,"Within these rays his Maker.” Like the leaf,"
3989,CANTO XXVI,That bows its lithe top till the blast is blown;
3990,CANTO XXVI,By its own virtue rear’d then stands aloof;
3991,CANTO XXVI,"So I, the whilst she said, awe-stricken bow’d."
3992,CANTO XXVI,Then eagerness to speak embolden’d me;
3993,CANTO XXVI,And I began: “O fruit! that wast alone
3994,CANTO XXVI,"Mature, when first engender’d! Ancient father!"
3995,CANTO XXVI,That doubly seest in every wedded bride
3996,CANTO XXVI,Thy daughter by affinity and blood!
3997,CANTO XXVI,"Devoutly as I may, I pray thee hold"
3998,CANTO XXVI,"Converse with me: my will thou seest; and I,"
3999,CANTO XXVI,"More speedily to hear thee, tell it not.”"
4000,CANTO XXVI,
4001,CANTO XXVI,"It chanceth oft some animal bewrays,"
4002,CANTO XXVI,Through the sleek cov’ring of his furry coat.
4003,CANTO XXVI,"The fondness, that stirs in him and conforms"
4004,CANTO XXVI,His outside seeming to the cheer within:
4005,CANTO XXVI,And in like guise was Adam’s spirit mov’d
4006,CANTO XXVI,"To joyous mood, that through the covering shone,"
4007,CANTO XXVI,"Transparent, when to pleasure me it spake:"
4008,CANTO XXVI,"“No need thy will be told, which I untold"
4009,CANTO XXVI,"Better discern, than thou whatever thing"
4010,CANTO XXVI,Thou holdst most certain: for that will I see
4011,CANTO XXVI,"In Him, who is truth’s mirror, and Himself"
4012,CANTO XXVI,"Parhelion unto all things, and naught else"
4013,CANTO XXVI,To him. This wouldst thou hear; how long since God
4014,CANTO XXVI,"Plac’d me high garden, from whose hounds"
4015,CANTO XXVI,"She led me up in this ladder, steep and long;"
4016,CANTO XXVI,What space endur’d my season of delight;
4017,CANTO XXVI,Whence truly sprang the wrath that banish’d me;
4018,CANTO XXVI,"And what the language, which I spake and fram’d"
4019,CANTO XXVI,"Not that I tasted of the tree, my son,"
4020,CANTO XXVI,"Was in itself the cause of that exile,"
4021,CANTO XXVI,But only my transgressing of the mark
4022,CANTO XXVI,"Assign’d me. There, whence at thy lady’s hest"
4023,CANTO XXVI,"The Mantuan mov’d him, still was I debarr’d"
4024,CANTO XXVI,"This council, till the sun had made complete,"
4025,CANTO XXVI,"Four thousand and three hundred rounds and twice,"
4026,CANTO XXVI,"His annual journey; and, through every light"
4027,CANTO XXVI,"In his broad pathway, saw I him return,"
4028,CANTO XXVI,"Thousand save sev’nty times, the whilst I dwelt"
4029,CANTO XXVI,Upon the earth. The language I did use
4030,CANTO XXVI,"Was worn away, or ever Nimrod’s race"
4031,CANTO XXVI,Their unaccomplishable work began.
4032,CANTO XXVI,"For naught, that man inclines to, ere was lasting,"
4033,CANTO XXVI,"Left by his reason free, and variable,"
4034,CANTO XXVI,"As is the sky that sways him. That he speaks,"
4035,CANTO XXVI,"Is nature’s prompting: whether thus or thus,"
4036,CANTO XXVI,"She leaves to you, as ye do most affect it."
4037,CANTO XXVI,"Ere I descended into hell’s abyss,"
4038,CANTO XXVI,"El was the name on earth of the Chief Good,"
4039,CANTO XXVI,Whose joy enfolds me: Eli then ’twas call’d
4040,CANTO XXVI,"And so beseemeth: for, in mortals, use"
4041,CANTO XXVI,"Is as the leaf upon the bough; that goes,"
4042,CANTO XXVI,And other comes instead. Upon the mount
4043,CANTO XXVI,"Most high above the waters, all my life,"
4044,CANTO XXVI,"Both innocent and guilty, did but reach"
4045,CANTO XXVI,"From the first hour, to that which cometh next"
4046,CANTO XXVI,"(As the sun changes quarter), to the sixth.”"
4047,CANTO XXVI,
4048,CANTO XXVI,
4049,CANTO XXVI,
4050,CANTO XXVI,
4051,CANTO XXVII,CANTO XXVII
4052,CANTO XXVII,
4053,CANTO XXVII,
4054,CANTO XXVII,"Then “Glory to the Father, to the Son,"
4055,CANTO XXVII,"And to the Holy Spirit,” rang aloud"
4056,CANTO XXVII,"Throughout all Paradise, that with the song"
4057,CANTO XXVII,"My spirit reel’d, so passing sweet the strain:"
4058,CANTO XXVII,And what I saw was equal ecstasy;
4059,CANTO XXVII,"One universal smile it seem’d of all things,"
4060,CANTO XXVII,"Joy past compare, gladness unutterable,"
4061,CANTO XXVII,"Imperishable life of peace and love,"
4062,CANTO XXVII,Exhaustless riches and unmeasur’d bliss.
4063,CANTO XXVII,
4064,CANTO XXVII,Before mine eyes stood the four torches lit;
4065,CANTO XXVII,"And that, which first had come, began to wax"
4066,CANTO XXVII,"In brightness, and in semblance such became,"
4067,CANTO XXVII,"As Jove might be, if he and Mars were birds,"
4068,CANTO XXVII,"And interchang’d their plumes. Silence ensued,"
4069,CANTO XXVII,"Through the blest quire, by Him, who here appoints"
4070,CANTO XXVII,"Vicissitude of ministry, enjoin’d;"
4071,CANTO XXVII,"When thus I heard: “Wonder not, if my hue"
4072,CANTO XXVII,"Be chang’d; for, while I speak, these shalt thou see"
4073,CANTO XXVII,All in like manner change with me. My place
4074,CANTO XXVII,"He who usurps on earth (my place, ay, mine,"
4075,CANTO XXVII,Which in the presence of the Son of God
4076,CANTO XXVII,"Is void), the same hath made my cemetery"
4077,CANTO XXVII,A common sewer of puddle and of blood:
4078,CANTO XXVII,"The more below his triumph, who from hence"
4079,CANTO XXVII,"Malignant fell.” Such colour, as the sun,"
4080,CANTO XXVII,"At eve or morning, paints an adverse cloud,"
4081,CANTO XXVII,Then saw I sprinkled over all the sky.
4082,CANTO XXVII,"And as th’ unblemish’d dame, who in herself"
4083,CANTO XXVII,"Secure of censure, yet at bare report"
4084,CANTO XXVII,"Of other’s failing, shrinks with maiden fear;"
4085,CANTO XXVII,So Beatrice in her semblance chang’d:
4086,CANTO XXVII,"And such eclipse in heav’n methinks was seen,"
4087,CANTO XXVII,When the Most Holy suffer’d. Then the words
4088,CANTO XXVII,"Proceeded, with voice, alter’d from itself"
4089,CANTO XXVII,"So clean, the semblance did not alter more."
4090,CANTO XXVII,"“Not to this end was Christ’s spouse with my blood,"
4091,CANTO XXVII,"With that of Linus, and of Cletus fed:"
4092,CANTO XXVII,That she might serve for purchase of base gold:
4093,CANTO XXVII,But for the purchase of this happy life
4094,CANTO XXVII,"Did Sextus, Pius, and Callixtus bleed,"
4095,CANTO XXVII,"And Urban, they, whose doom was not without"
4096,CANTO XXVII,Much weeping seal’d. No purpose was of our
4097,CANTO XXVII,That on the right hand of our successors
4098,CANTO XXVII,"Part of the Christian people should be set,"
4099,CANTO XXVII,"And part upon their left; nor that the keys,"
4100,CANTO XXVII,"Which were vouchsaf’d me, should for ensign serve"
4101,CANTO XXVII,"Unto the banners, that do levy war"
4102,CANTO XXVII,"On the baptiz’d: nor I, for sigil-mark"
4103,CANTO XXVII,Set upon sold and lying privileges;
4104,CANTO XXVII,Which makes me oft to bicker and turn red.
4105,CANTO XXVII,In shepherd’s clothing greedy wolves below
4106,CANTO XXVII,Range wide o’er all the pastures. Arm of God!
4107,CANTO XXVII,Why longer sleepst thou? Caorsines and Gascona
4108,CANTO XXVII,Prepare to quaff our blood. O good beginning
4109,CANTO XXVII,To what a vile conclusion must thou stoop!
4110,CANTO XXVII,"But the high providence, which did defend"
4111,CANTO XXVII,"Through Scipio the world’s glory unto Rome,"
4112,CANTO XXVII,"Will not delay its succour: and thou, son,"
4113,CANTO XXVII,Who through thy mortal weight shall yet again
4114,CANTO XXVII,"Return below, open thy lips, nor hide"
4115,CANTO XXVII,What is by me not hidden.” As a Hood
4116,CANTO XXVII,"Of frozen vapours streams adown the air,"
4117,CANTO XXVII,What time the she-goat with her skiey horn
4118,CANTO XXVII,Touches the sun; so saw I there stream wide
4119,CANTO XXVII,"The vapours, who with us had linger’d late"
4120,CANTO XXVII,And with glad triumph deck th’ ethereal cope.
4121,CANTO XXVII,Onward my sight their semblances pursued;
4122,CANTO XXVII,"So far pursued, as till the space between"
4123,CANTO XXVII,From its reach sever’d them: whereat the guide
4124,CANTO XXVII,"Celestial, marking me no more intent"
4125,CANTO XXVII,"On upward gazing, said, “Look down and see"
4126,CANTO XXVII,What circuit thou hast compass’d.” From the hour
4127,CANTO XXVII,"When I before had cast my view beneath,"
4128,CANTO XXVII,"All the first region overpast I saw,"
4129,CANTO XXVII,Which from the midmost to the bound’ry winds;
4130,CANTO XXVII,That onward thence from Gades I beheld
4131,CANTO XXVII,"The unwise passage of Laertes’ son,"
4132,CANTO XXVII,"And hitherward the shore, where thou, Europa!"
4133,CANTO XXVII,Mad’st thee a joyful burden: and yet more
4134,CANTO XXVII,"Of this dim spot had seen, but that the sun,"
4135,CANTO XXVII,"A constellation off and more, had ta’en"
4136,CANTO XXVII,His progress in the zodiac underneath.
4137,CANTO XXVII,
4138,CANTO XXVII,"Then by the spirit, that doth never leave"
4139,CANTO XXVII,"Its amorous dalliance with my lady’s looks,"
4140,CANTO XXVII,Back with redoubled ardour were mine eyes
4141,CANTO XXVII,"Led unto her: and from her radiant smiles,"
4142,CANTO XXVII,"Whenas I turn’d me, pleasure so divine"
4143,CANTO XXVII,"Did lighten on me, that whatever bait"
4144,CANTO XXVII,"Or art or nature in the human flesh,"
4145,CANTO XXVII,"Or in its limn’d resemblance, can combine"
4146,CANTO XXVII,"Through greedy eyes to take the soul withal,"
4147,CANTO XXVII,Were to her beauty nothing. Its boon influence
4148,CANTO XXVII,"From the fair nest of Leda rapt me forth,"
4149,CANTO XXVII,And wafted on into the swiftest heav’n.
4150,CANTO XXVII,
4151,CANTO XXVII,"What place for entrance Beatrice chose,"
4152,CANTO XXVII,"I may not say, so uniform was all,"
4153,CANTO XXVII,Liveliest and loftiest. She my secret wish
4154,CANTO XXVII,"Divin’d; and with such gladness, that God’s love"
4155,CANTO XXVII,"Seem’d from her visage shining, thus began:"
4156,CANTO XXVII,"“Here is the goal, whence motion on his race"
4157,CANTO XXVII,"Starts; motionless the centre, and the rest"
4158,CANTO XXVII,"All mov’d around. Except the soul divine,"
4159,CANTO XXVII,"Place in this heav’n is none, the soul divine,"
4160,CANTO XXVII,"Wherein the love, which ruleth o’er its orb,"
4161,CANTO XXVII,"Is kindled, and the virtue that it sheds;"
4162,CANTO XXVII,"One circle, light and love, enclasping it,"
4163,CANTO XXVII,"As this doth clasp the others; and to Him,"
4164,CANTO XXVII,"Who draws the bound, its limit only known."
4165,CANTO XXVII,"Measur’d itself by none, it doth divide"
4166,CANTO XXVII,"Motion to all, counted unto them forth,"
4167,CANTO XXVII,As by the fifth or half ye count forth ten.
4168,CANTO XXVII,"The vase, wherein time’s roots are plung’d, thou seest,"
4169,CANTO XXVII,Look elsewhere for the leaves. O mortal lust!
4170,CANTO XXVII,That canst not lift thy head above the waves
4171,CANTO XXVII,Which whelm and sink thee down! The will in man
4172,CANTO XXVII,Bears goodly blossoms; but its ruddy promise
4173,CANTO XXVII,"Is, by the dripping of perpetual rain,"
4174,CANTO XXVII,Made mere abortion: faith and innocence
4175,CANTO XXVII,"Are met with but in babes, each taking leave"
4176,CANTO XXVII,"Ere cheeks with down are sprinkled; he, that fasts,"
4177,CANTO XXVII,"While yet a stammerer, with his tongue let loose"
4178,CANTO XXVII,Gluts every food alike in every moon.
4179,CANTO XXVII,"One yet a babbler, loves and listens to"
4180,CANTO XXVII,His mother; but no sooner hath free use
4181,CANTO XXVII,"Of speech, than he doth wish her in her grave."
4182,CANTO XXVII,"So suddenly doth the fair child of him,"
4183,CANTO XXVII,"Whose welcome is the morn and eve his parting,"
4184,CANTO XXVII,To negro blackness change her virgin white.
4185,CANTO XXVII,
4186,CANTO XXVII,"“Thou, to abate thy wonder, note that none"
4187,CANTO XXVII,"Bears rule in earth, and its frail family"
4188,CANTO XXVII,"Are therefore wand’rers. Yet before the date,"
4189,CANTO XXVII,When through the hundredth in his reck’ning drops
4190,CANTO XXVII,Pale January must be shor’d aside
4191,CANTO XXVII,"From winter’s calendar, these heav’nly spheres"
4192,CANTO XXVII,"Shall roar so loud, that fortune shall be fain"
4193,CANTO XXVII,"To turn the poop, where she hath now the prow;"
4194,CANTO XXVII,"So that the fleet run onward; and true fruit,"
4195,CANTO XXVII,"Expected long, shall crown at last the bloom!”"

4200,CANTO XXVII,CANTO XXVII
4201,CANTO XXVII,
4202,CANTO XXVII,
4203,CANTO XXVII,"So she who doth imparadise my soul,"
4204,CANTO XXVII,"Had drawn the veil from off our pleasant life,"
4205,CANTO XXVII,And bar’d the truth of poor mortality;
4206,CANTO XXVII,"When lo! as one who, in a mirror, spies"
4207,CANTO XXVII,"The shining of a flambeau at his back,"
4208,CANTO XXVII,"Lit sudden ore he deem of its approach,"
4209,CANTO XXVII,"And turneth to resolve him, if the glass"
4210,CANTO XXVII,"Have told him true, and sees the record faithful"
4211,CANTO XXVII,"As note is to its metre; even thus,"
4212,CANTO XXVII,"I well remember, did befall to me,"
4213,CANTO XXVII,"Looking upon the beauteous eyes, whence love"
4214,CANTO XXVII,Had made the leash to take me. As I turn’d;
4215,CANTO XXVII,"And that, which, in their circles, none who spies,"
4216,CANTO XXVII,"Can miss of, in itself apparent, struck"
4217,CANTO XXVII,"On mine; a point I saw, that darted light"
4218,CANTO XXVII,"So sharp, no lid, unclosing, may bear up"
4219,CANTO XXVII,Against its keenness. The least star we view
4220,CANTO XXVII,"From hence, had seem’d a moon, set by its side,"
4221,CANTO XXVII,"As star by side of star. And so far off,"
4222,CANTO XXVII,"Perchance, as is the halo from the light"
4223,CANTO XXVII,"Which paints it, when most dense the vapour spreads,"
4224,CANTO XXVII,"There wheel’d about the point a circle of fire,"
4225,CANTO XXVII,"More rapid than the motion, which first girds"
4226,CANTO XXVII,"The world. Then, circle after circle, round"
4227,CANTO XXVII,Enring’d each other; till the seventh reach’d
4228,CANTO XXVII,"Circumference so ample, that its bow,"
4229,CANTO XXVII,"Within the span of Juno’s messenger,"
4230,CANTO XXVII,"lied scarce been held entire. Beyond the sev’nth,"
4231,CANTO XXVII,"Follow’d yet other two. And every one,"
4232,CANTO XXVII,"As more in number distant from the first,"
4233,CANTO XXVII,Was tardier in motion; and that glow’d
4234,CANTO XXVII,"With flame most pure, that to the sparkle’ of truth"
4235,CANTO XXVII,"Was nearest, as partaking most, methinks,"
4236,CANTO XXVII,Of its reality. The guide belov’d
4237,CANTO XXVII,"Saw me in anxious thought suspense, and spake:"
4238,CANTO XXVII,"“Heav’n, and all nature, hangs upon that point."
4239,CANTO XXVII,The circle thereto most conjoin’d observe;
4240,CANTO XXVII,"And know, that by intenser love its course"
4241,CANTO XXVII,Is to this swiftness wing’d.” To whom I thus:
4242,CANTO XXVII,"“It were enough; nor should I further seek,"
4243,CANTO XXVII,"Had I but witness’d order, in the world"
4244,CANTO XXVII,"Appointed, such as in these wheels is seen."
4245,CANTO XXVII,"But in the sensible world such diff’rence is,"
4246,CANTO XXVII,"That is each round shows more divinity,"
4247,CANTO XXVII,"As each is wider from the centre. Hence,"
4248,CANTO XXVII,"If in this wondrous and angelic temple,"
4249,CANTO XXVII,"That hath for confine only light and love,"
4250,CANTO XXVII,"My wish may have completion I must know,"
4251,CANTO XXVII,Wherefore such disagreement is between
4252,CANTO XXVII,"Th’ exemplar and its copy: for myself,"
4253,CANTO XXVII,"Contemplating, I fail to pierce the cause.”"
4254,CANTO XXVII,
4255,CANTO XXVII,"“It is no marvel, if thy fingers foil’d"
4256,CANTO XXVII,Do leave the knot untied: so hard ’tis grown
4257,CANTO XXVII,"For want of tenting.” Thus she said: “But take,”"
4258,CANTO XXVII,"She added, “if thou wish thy cure, my words,"
4259,CANTO XXVII,And entertain them subtly. Every orb
4260,CANTO XXVII,"Corporeal, doth proportion its extent"
4261,CANTO XXVII,Unto the virtue through its parts diffus’d.
4262,CANTO XXVII,The greater blessedness preserves the more.
4263,CANTO XXVII,The greater is the body (if all parts
4264,CANTO XXVII,Share equally) the more is to preserve.
4265,CANTO XXVII,"Therefore the circle, whose swift course enwheels"
4266,CANTO XXVII,"The universal frame answers to that,"
4267,CANTO XXVII,Which is supreme in knowledge and in love
4268,CANTO XXVII,"Thus by the virtue, not the seeming, breadth"
4269,CANTO XXVII,"Of substance, measure, thou shalt see the heav’ns,"
4270,CANTO XXVII,"Each to the’ intelligence that ruleth it,"
4271,CANTO XXVII,"Greater to more, and smaller unto less,"
4272,CANTO XXVII,Suited in strict and wondrous harmony.”
4273,CANTO XXVII,
4274,CANTO XXVII,As when the sturdy north blows from his cheek
4275,CANTO XXVII,"A blast, that scours the sky, forthwith our air,"
4276,CANTO XXVII,"Clear’d of the rack, that hung on it before,"
4277,CANTO XXVII,"Glitters; and, With his beauties all unveil’d,"
4278,CANTO XXVII,"The firmament looks forth serene, and smiles;"
4279,CANTO XXVII,"Such was my cheer, when Beatrice drove"
4280,CANTO XXVII,"With clear reply the shadows back, and truth"
4281,CANTO XXVII,"Was manifested, as a star in heaven."
4282,CANTO XXVII,"And when the words were ended, not unlike"
4283,CANTO XXVII,"To iron in the furnace, every cirque"
4284,CANTO XXVII,Ebullient shot forth scintillating fires:
4285,CANTO XXVII,"And every sparkle shivering to new blaze,"
4286,CANTO XXVII,In number did outmillion the account
4287,CANTO XXVII,Reduplicate upon the chequer’d board.
4288,CANTO XXVII,"Then heard I echoing on from choir to choir,"
4289,CANTO XXVII,"“Hosanna,” to the fixed point, that holds,"
4290,CANTO XXVII,"And shall for ever hold them to their place,"
4291,CANTO XXVII,"From everlasting, irremovable."
4292,CANTO XXVII,
4293,CANTO XXVII,"Musing awhile I stood: and she, who saw"
4294,CANTO XXVII,"by inward meditations, thus began:"
4295,CANTO XXVII,"“In the first circles, they, whom thou beheldst,"
4296,CANTO XXVII,Are seraphim and cherubim. Thus swift
4297,CANTO XXVII,"Follow their hoops, in likeness to the point,"
4298,CANTO XXVII,"Near as they can, approaching; and they can"
4299,CANTO XXVII,"The more, the loftier their vision. Those,"
4300,CANTO XXVII,"That round them fleet, gazing the Godhead next,"
4301,CANTO XXVII,Are thrones; in whom the first trine ends. And all
4302,CANTO XXVII,"Are blessed, even as their sight descends"
4303,CANTO XXVII,"Deeper into the truth, wherein rest is"
4304,CANTO XXVII,For every mind. Thus happiness hath root
4305,CANTO XXVII,"In seeing, not in loving, which of sight"
4306,CANTO XXVII,Is aftergrowth. And of the seeing such
4307,CANTO XXVII,"The meed, as unto each in due degree"
4308,CANTO XXVII,Grace and good-will their measure have assign’d.
4309,CANTO XXVII,"The other trine, that with still opening buds"
4310,CANTO XXVII,"In this eternal springtide blossom fair,"
4311,CANTO XXVII,"Fearless of bruising from the nightly ram,"
4312,CANTO XXVII,Breathe up in warbled melodies threefold
4313,CANTO XXVII,"Hosannas blending ever, from the three"
4314,CANTO XXVII,"Transmitted. hierarchy of gods, for aye"
4315,CANTO XXVII,"Rejoicing, dominations first, next then"
4316,CANTO XXVII,"Virtues, and powers the third. The next to whom"
4317,CANTO XXVII,"Are princedoms and archangels, with glad round"
4318,CANTO XXVII,To tread their festal ring; and last the band
4319,CANTO XXVII,"Angelical, disporting in their sphere."
4320,CANTO XXVII,"All, as they circle in their orders, look"
4321,CANTO XXVII,"Aloft, and downward with such sway prevail,"
4322,CANTO XXVII,That all with mutual impulse tend to God.
4323,CANTO XXVII,These once a mortal view beheld. Desire
4324,CANTO XXVII,"In Dionysius so intently wrought,"
4325,CANTO XXVII,"That he, as I have done rang’d them; and nam’d"
4326,CANTO XXVII,"Their orders, marshal’d in his thought. From him"
4327,CANTO XXVII,"Dissentient, one refus’d his sacred read."
4328,CANTO XXVII,But soon as in this heav’n his doubting eyes
4329,CANTO XXVII,"Were open’d, Gregory at his error smil’d"
4330,CANTO XXVII,"Nor marvel, that a denizen of earth"
4331,CANTO XXVII,Should scan such secret truth; for he had learnt
4332,CANTO XXVII,"Both this and much beside of these our orbs,"
4333,CANTO XXVII,From an eye-witness to heav’n’s mysteries.”

4341,CANTO XXIX,No longer than what time Latona’s twins
4342,CANTO XXIX,"Cover’d of Libra and the fleecy star,"
4343,CANTO XXIX,"Together both, girding the’ horizon hang,"
4344,CANTO XXIX,"In even balance from the zenith pois’d,"
4345,CANTO XXIX,"Till from that verge, each, changing hemisphere,"
4346,CANTO XXIX,Part the nice level; e’en so brief a space
4347,CANTO XXIX,Did Beatrice’s silence hold. A smile
4348,CANTO XXIX,Bat painted on her cheek; and her fix’d gaze
4349,CANTO XXIX,"Bent on the point, at which my vision fail’d:"
4350,CANTO XXIX,When thus her words resuming she began:
4351,CANTO XXIX,"“I speak, nor what thou wouldst inquire demand;"
4352,CANTO XXIX,"For I have mark’d it, where all time and place"
4353,CANTO XXIX,Are present. Not for increase to himself
4354,CANTO XXIX,"Of good, which may not be increas’d, but forth"
4355,CANTO XXIX,"To manifest his glory by its beams,"
4356,CANTO XXIX,"Inhabiting his own eternity,"
4357,CANTO XXIX,Beyond time’s limit or what bound soe’er
4358,CANTO XXIX,"To circumscribe his being, as he will’d,"
4359,CANTO XXIX,"Into new natures, like unto himself,"
4360,CANTO XXIX,"Eternal Love unfolded. Nor before,"
4361,CANTO XXIX,As if in dull inaction torpid lay.
4362,CANTO XXIX,For not in process of before or aft
4363,CANTO XXIX,Upon these waters mov’d the Spirit of God.
4364,CANTO XXIX,"Simple and mix’d, both form and substance, forth"
4365,CANTO XXIX,"To perfect being started, like three darts"
4366,CANTO XXIX,Shot from a bow three-corded. And as ray
4367,CANTO XXIX,"In crystal, glass, and amber, shines entire,"
4368,CANTO XXIX,E’en at the moment of its issuing; thus
4369,CANTO XXIX,"Did, from th’ eternal Sovran, beam entire"
4370,CANTO XXIX,"His threefold operation, at one act"
4371,CANTO XXIX,Produc’d coeval. Yet in order each
4372,CANTO XXIX,"Created his due station knew: those highest,"
4373,CANTO XXIX,Who pure intelligence were made: mere power
4374,CANTO XXIX,"The lowest: in the midst, bound with strict league,"
4375,CANTO XXIX,"Intelligence and power, unsever’d bond."
4376,CANTO XXIX,"Long tract of ages by the angels past,"
4377,CANTO XXIX,"Ere the creating of another world,"
4378,CANTO XXIX,Describ’d on Jerome’s pages thou hast seen.
4379,CANTO XXIX,"But that what I disclose to thee is true,"
4380,CANTO XXIX,"Those penmen, whom the Holy Spirit mov’d"
4381,CANTO XXIX,In many a passage of their sacred book
4382,CANTO XXIX,Attest; as thou by diligent search shalt find
4383,CANTO XXIX,"And reason in some sort discerns the same,"
4384,CANTO XXIX,Who scarce would grant the heav’nly ministers
4385,CANTO XXIX,"Of their perfection void, so long a space."
4386,CANTO XXIX,"Thus when and where these spirits of love were made,"
4387,CANTO XXIX,"Thou know’st, and how: and knowing hast allay’d"
4388,CANTO XXIX,"Thy thirst, which from the triple question rose."
4389,CANTO XXIX,"Ere one had reckon’d twenty, e’en so soon"
4390,CANTO XXIX,Part of the angels fell: and in their fall
4391,CANTO XXIX,Confusion to your elements ensued.
4392,CANTO XXIX,"The others kept their station: and this task,"
4393,CANTO XXIX,"Whereon thou lookst, began with such delight,"
4394,CANTO XXIX,"That they surcease not ever, day nor night,"
4395,CANTO XXIX,Their circling. Of that fatal lapse the cause
4396,CANTO XXIX,"Was the curst pride of him, whom thou hast seen"
4397,CANTO XXIX,"Pent with the world’s incumbrance. Those, whom here"
4398,CANTO XXIX,"Thou seest, were lowly to confess themselves"
4399,CANTO XXIX,"Of his free bounty, who had made them apt"
4400,CANTO XXIX,For ministries so high: therefore their views
4401,CANTO XXIX,Were by enlight’ning grace and their own merit
4402,CANTO XXIX,Exalted; so that in their will confirm’d
4403,CANTO XXIX,"They stand, nor feel to fall. For do not doubt,"
4404,CANTO XXIX,"But to receive the grace, which heav’n vouchsafes,"
4405,CANTO XXIX,"Is meritorious, even as the soul"
4406,CANTO XXIX,With prompt affection welcometh the guest.
4407,CANTO XXIX,"Now, without further help, if with good heed"
4408,CANTO XXIX,"My words thy mind have treasur’d, thou henceforth"
4409,CANTO XXIX,"This consistory round about mayst scan,"
4410,CANTO XXIX,And gaze thy fill. But since thou hast on earth
4411,CANTO XXIX,"Heard vain disputers, reasoners in the schools,"
4412,CANTO XXIX,"Canvas the’ angelic nature, and dispute"
4413,CANTO XXIX,"Its powers of apprehension, memory, choice;"
4414,CANTO XXIX,"Therefore, ’tis well thou take from me the truth,"
4415,CANTO XXIX,"Pure and without disguise, which they below,"
4416,CANTO XXIX,"Equivocating, darken and perplex."
4417,CANTO XXIX,
4418,CANTO XXIX,"“Know thou, that, from the first, these substances,"
4419,CANTO XXIX,"Rejoicing in the countenance of God,"
4420,CANTO XXIX,"Have held unceasingly their view, intent"
4421,CANTO XXIX,"Upon the glorious vision, from the which"
4422,CANTO XXIX,Naught absent is nor hid: where then no change
4423,CANTO XXIX,"Of newness with succession interrupts,"
4424,CANTO XXIX,Remembrance there needs none to gather up
4425,CANTO XXIX,Divided thought and images remote
4426,CANTO XXIX,
4427,CANTO XXIX,"“So that men, thus at variance with the truth"
4428,CANTO XXIX,"Dream, though their eyes be open; reckless some"
4429,CANTO XXIX,"Of error; others well aware they err,"
4430,CANTO XXIX,To whom more guilt and shame are justly due.
4431,CANTO XXIX,Each the known track of sage philosophy
4432,CANTO XXIX,"Deserts, and has a byway of his own:"
4433,CANTO XXIX,So much the restless eagerness to shine
4434,CANTO XXIX,And love of singularity prevail.
4435,CANTO XXIX,"Yet this, offensive as it is, provokes"
4436,CANTO XXIX,"Heav’n’s anger less, than when the book of God"
4437,CANTO XXIX,"Is forc’d to yield to man’s authority,"
4438,CANTO XXIX,Or from its straightness warp’d: no reck’ning made
4439,CANTO XXIX,What blood the sowing of it in the world
4440,CANTO XXIX,"Has cost; what favour for himself he wins,"
4441,CANTO XXIX,Who meekly clings to it. The aim of all
4442,CANTO XXIX,"Is how to shine: e’en they, whose office is"
4443,CANTO XXIX,"To preach the Gospel, let the gospel sleep,"
4444,CANTO XXIX,And pass their own inventions off instead.
4445,CANTO XXIX,"One tells, how at Christ’s suffering the wan moon"
4446,CANTO XXIX,"Bent back her steps, and shadow’d o’er the sun"
4447,CANTO XXIX,"With intervenient disk, as she withdrew:"
4448,CANTO XXIX,"Another, how the light shrouded itself"
4449,CANTO XXIX,"Within its tabernacle, and left dark"
4450,CANTO XXIX,"The Spaniard and the Indian, with the Jew."
4451,CANTO XXIX,"Such fables Florence in her pulpit hears,"
4452,CANTO XXIX,"Bandied about more frequent, than the names"
4453,CANTO XXIX,Of Bindi and of Lapi in her streets.
4454,CANTO XXIX,"The sheep, meanwhile, poor witless ones, return"
4455,CANTO XXIX,"From pasture, fed with wind: and what avails"
4456,CANTO XXIX,"For their excuse, they do not see their harm?"
4457,CANTO XXIX,"Christ said not to his first conventicle,"
4458,CANTO XXIX,"‘Go forth and preach impostures to the world,’"
4459,CANTO XXIX,But gave them truth to build on; and the sound
4460,CANTO XXIX,"Was mighty on their lips; nor needed they,"
4461,CANTO XXIX,"Beside the gospel, other spear or shield,"
4462,CANTO XXIX,To aid them in their warfare for the faith.
4463,CANTO XXIX,The preacher now provides himself with store
4464,CANTO XXIX,"Of jests and gibes; and, so there be no lack"
4465,CANTO XXIX,"Of laughter, while he vents them, his big cowl"
4466,CANTO XXIX,"Distends, and he has won the meed he sought:"
4467,CANTO XXIX,Could but the vulgar catch a glimpse the while
4468,CANTO XXIX,"Of that dark bird which nestles in his hood,"
4469,CANTO XXIX,They scarce would wait to hear the blessing said.
4470,CANTO XXIX,"Which now the dotards hold in such esteem,"
4471,CANTO XXIX,"That every counterfeit, who spreads abroad"
4472,CANTO XXIX,"The hands of holy promise, finds a throng"
4473,CANTO XXIX,Of credulous fools beneath. Saint Anthony
4474,CANTO XXIX,"Fattens with this his swine, and others worse"

4478,CANTO XXIX,“But (for we far have wander’d) let us seek

4549,CANTO XXX,
4550,CANTO XXX,"As when the lightning, in a sudden spleen"
4551,CANTO XXX,"Unfolded, dashes from the blinding eyes"
4552,CANTO XXX,The visive spirits dazzled and bedimm’d;
4553,CANTO XXX,"So, round about me, fulminating streams"
4554,CANTO XXX,"Of living radiance play’d, and left me swath’d"
4555,CANTO XXX,And veil’d in dense impenetrable blaze.
4556,CANTO XXX,"Such weal is in the love, that stills this heav’n;"
4557,CANTO XXX,For its own flame the torch this fitting ever!
4558,CANTO XXX,
4559,CANTO XXX,No sooner to my list’ning ear had come
4560,CANTO XXX,"The brief assurance, than I understood"
4561,CANTO XXX,"New virtue into me infus’d, and sight"
4562,CANTO XXX,"Kindled afresh, with vigour to sustain"
4563,CANTO XXX,"Excess of light, however pure. I look’d;"
4564,CANTO XXX,And in the likeness of a river saw
4565,CANTO XXX,"Light flowing, from whose amber-seeming waves"
4566,CANTO XXX,"Flash’d up effulgence, as they glided on"
4567,CANTO XXX,"’Twixt banks, on either side, painted with spring,"
4568,CANTO XXX,"Incredible how fair; and, from the tide,"
4569,CANTO XXX,"There ever and anon, outstarting, flew"
4570,CANTO XXX,Sparkles instinct with life; and in the flow’rs
4571,CANTO XXX,"Did set them, like to rubies chas’d in gold;"
4572,CANTO XXX,"Then, as if drunk with odors, plung’d again"
4573,CANTO XXX,"Into the wondrous flood; from which, as one"
4574,CANTO XXX,"Re’enter’d, still another rose. “The thirst"
4575,CANTO XXX,"Of knowledge high, whereby thou art inflam’d,"
4576,CANTO XXX,"To search the meaning of what here thou seest,"
4577,CANTO XXX,"The more it warms thee, pleases me the more."
4578,CANTO XXX,"But first behooves thee of this water drink,"
4579,CANTO XXX,Or ere that longing be allay’d.” So spake
4580,CANTO XXX,The day-star of mine eyes; then thus subjoin’d:
4581,CANTO XXX,"“This stream, and these, forth issuing from its gulf,"
4582,CANTO XXX,"And diving back, a living topaz each,"
4583,CANTO XXX,"With all this laughter on its bloomy shores,"
4584,CANTO XXX,"Are but a preface, shadowy of the truth"
4585,CANTO XXX,"They emblem: not that, in themselves, the things"
4586,CANTO XXX,"Are crude; but on thy part is the defect,"
4587,CANTO XXX,For that thy views not yet aspire so high.”
4588,CANTO XXX,"Never did babe, that had outslept his wont,"
4589,CANTO XXX,"Rush, with such eager straining, to the milk,"
4590,CANTO XXX,"As I toward the water, bending me,"
4591,CANTO XXX,To make the better mirrors of mine eyes
4592,CANTO XXX,"In the refining wave; and, as the eaves"
4593,CANTO XXX,"Of mine eyelids did drink of it, forthwith"
4594,CANTO XXX,"Seem’d it unto me turn’d from length to round,"
4595,CANTO XXX,"Then as a troop of maskers, when they put"
4596,CANTO XXX,"Their vizors off, look other than before,"
4597,CANTO XXX,The counterfeited semblance thrown aside;
4598,CANTO XXX,So into greater jubilee were chang’d
4599,CANTO XXX,"Those flowers and sparkles, and distinct I saw"
4600,CANTO XXX,Before me either court of heav’n displac’d.
4601,CANTO XXX,
4602,CANTO XXX,O prime enlightener! thou who crav’st me strength
4603,CANTO XXX,On the high triumph of thy realm to gaze!
4604,CANTO XXX,"Grant virtue now to utter what I kenn’d,"
4605,CANTO XXX,"There is in heav’n a light, whose goodly shine"
4606,CANTO XXX,Makes the Creator visible to all
4607,CANTO XXX,"Created, that in seeing him alone"
4608,CANTO XXX,"Have peace; and in a circle spreads so far,"
4609,CANTO XXX,That the circumference were too loose a zone
4610,CANTO XXX,"To girdle in the sun. All is one beam,"
4611,CANTO XXX,"Reflected from the summit of the first,"
4612,CANTO XXX,"That moves, which being hence and vigour takes,"
4613,CANTO XXX,"And as some cliff, that from the bottom eyes"
4614,CANTO XXX,"Its image mirror’d in the crystal flood,"
4615,CANTO XXX,As if ’t admire its brave appareling
4616,CANTO XXX,"Of verdure and of flowers: so, round about,"
4617,CANTO XXX,"Eyeing the light, on more than million thrones,"
4618,CANTO XXX,"Stood, eminent, whatever from our earth"
4619,CANTO XXX,Has to the skies return’d. How wide the leaves
4620,CANTO XXX,"Extended to their utmost of this rose,"
4621,CANTO XXX,Whose lowest step embosoms such a space
4622,CANTO XXX,"Of ample radiance! Yet, nor amplitude"
4623,CANTO XXX,"Nor height impeded, but my view with ease"
4624,CANTO XXX,Took in the full dimensions of that joy.
4625,CANTO XXX,"Near or remote, what there avails, where God"
4626,CANTO XXX,"Immediate rules, and Nature, awed, suspends"
4627,CANTO XXX,Her sway? Into the yellow of the rose
4628,CANTO XXX,"Perennial, which in bright expansiveness,"
4629,CANTO XXX,"Lays forth its gradual blooming, redolent"
4630,CANTO XXX,"Of praises to the never-wint’ring sun,"
4631,CANTO XXX,"As one, who fain would speak yet holds his peace,"
4632,CANTO XXX,"Beatrice led me; and, “Behold,” she said,"
4633,CANTO XXX,“This fair assemblage! stoles of snowy white
4634,CANTO XXX,"How numberless! The city, where we dwell,"
4635,CANTO XXX,Behold how vast! and these our seats so throng’d
4636,CANTO XXX,"Few now are wanting here! In that proud stall,"
4637,CANTO XXX,"On which, the crown, already o’er its state"
4638,CANTO XXX,"Suspended, holds thine eyes—or ere thyself"
4639,CANTO XXX,"Mayst at the wedding sup,—shall rest the soul"
4640,CANTO XXX,"Of the great Harry, he who, by the world"
4641,CANTO XXX,"Augustas hail’d, to Italy must come,"
4642,CANTO XXX,"Before her day be ripe. But ye are sick,"
4643,CANTO XXX,"And in your tetchy wantonness as blind,"
4644,CANTO XXX,"As is the bantling, that of hunger dies,"
4645,CANTO XXX,"And drives away the nurse. Nor may it be,"
4646,CANTO XXX,"That he, who in the sacred forum sways,"
4647,CANTO XXX,"Openly or in secret, shall with him"
4648,CANTO XXX,Accordant walk: Whom God will not endure
4649,CANTO XXX,I’ th’ holy office long; but thrust him down
4650,CANTO XXX,"To Simon Magus, where Magna’s priest"
4651,CANTO XXX,Will sink beneath him: such will be his meed.”
4652,CANTO XXX,
4653,CANTO XXX,
4654,CANTO XXX,
4655,CANTO XXX,
4656,CANTO XXXI,CANTO XXXI
4657,CANTO XXXI,
4658,CANTO XXXI,
4659,CANTO XXXI,"In fashion, as a snow-white rose, lay then"
4660,CANTO XXXI,"Before my view the saintly multitude,"
4661,CANTO XXXI,Which in his own blood Christ espous’d. Meanwhile
4662,CANTO XXXI,"That other host, that soar aloft to gaze"
4663,CANTO XXXI,"And celebrate his glory, whom they love,"
4664,CANTO XXXI,"Hover’d around; and, like a troop of bees,"
4665,CANTO XXXI,"Amid the vernal sweets alighting now,"
4666,CANTO XXXI,"Now, clustering, where their fragrant labour glows,"
4667,CANTO XXXI,"Flew downward to the mighty flow’r, or rose"
4668,CANTO XXXI,"From the redundant petals, streaming back"
4669,CANTO XXXI,Unto the steadfast dwelling of their joy.
4670,CANTO XXXI,"Faces had they of flame, and wings of gold;"
4671,CANTO XXXI,The rest was whiter than the driven snow.
4672,CANTO XXXI,"And as they flitted down into the flower,"
4673,CANTO XXXI,"From range to range, fanning their plumy loins,"
4674,CANTO XXXI,"Whisper’d the peace and ardour, which they won"
4675,CANTO XXXI,"From that soft winnowing. Shadow none, the vast"
4676,CANTO XXXI,Interposition of such numerous flight
4677,CANTO XXXI,"Cast, from above, upon the flower, or view"
4678,CANTO XXXI,"Obstructed aught. For, through the universe,"
4679,CANTO XXXI,"Wherever merited, celestial light"
4680,CANTO XXXI,"Glides freely, and no obstacle prevents."
4681,CANTO XXXI,
4682,CANTO XXXI,"All there, who reign in safety and in bliss,"
4683,CANTO XXXI,"Ages long past or new, on one sole mark"
4684,CANTO XXXI,Their love and vision fix’d. O trinal beam
4685,CANTO XXXI,"Of individual star, that charmst them thus,"
4686,CANTO XXXI,Vouchsafe one glance to gild our storm below!
4687,CANTO XXXI,
4688,CANTO XXXI,"If the grim brood, from Arctic shores that roam’d,"
4689,CANTO XXXI,"(Where helice, forever, as she wheels,"
4690,CANTO XXXI,Sparkles a mother’s fondness on her son)
4691,CANTO XXXI,"Stood in mute wonder ’mid the works of Rome,"
4692,CANTO XXXI,When to their view the Lateran arose
4693,CANTO XXXI,"In greatness more than earthly; I, who then"
4694,CANTO XXXI,"From human to divine had past, from time"
4695,CANTO XXXI,"Unto eternity, and out of Florence"
4696,CANTO XXXI,"To justice and to truth, how might I choose"
4697,CANTO XXXI,"But marvel too? ’Twixt gladness and amaze,"
4698,CANTO XXXI,"In sooth no will had I to utter aught,"
4699,CANTO XXXI,"Or hear. And, as a pilgrim, when he rests"
4700,CANTO XXXI,"Within the temple of his vow, looks round"
4701,CANTO XXXI,"In breathless awe, and hopes some time to tell"
4702,CANTO XXXI,Of all its goodly state: e’en so mine eyes
4703,CANTO XXXI,"Cours’d up and down along the living light,"
4704,CANTO XXXI,"Now low, and now aloft, and now around,"
4705,CANTO XXXI,"Visiting every step. Looks I beheld,"
4706,CANTO XXXI,"Where charity in soft persuasion sat,"
4707,CANTO XXXI,"Smiles from within and radiance from above,"
4708,CANTO XXXI,And in each gesture grace and honour high.
4709,CANTO XXXI,
4710,CANTO XXXI,"So rov’d my ken, and its general form"
4711,CANTO XXXI,All Paradise survey’d: when round I turn’d
4712,CANTO XXXI,With purpose of my lady to inquire
4713,CANTO XXXI,"Once more of things, that held my thought suspense,"
4714,CANTO XXXI,But answer found from other than I ween’d;
4715,CANTO XXXI,"For, Beatrice, when I thought to see,"
4716,CANTO XXXI,"I saw instead a senior, at my side,"
4717,CANTO XXXI,"Rob’d, as the rest, in glory. Joy benign"
4718,CANTO XXXI,"Glow’d in his eye, and o’er his cheek diffus’d,"
4719,CANTO XXXI,With gestures such as spake a father’s love.
4720,CANTO XXXI,"And, “Whither is she vanish’d?” straight I ask’d."
4721,CANTO XXXI,
4722,CANTO XXXI,"“By Beatrice summon’d,” he replied,"
4723,CANTO XXXI,“I come to aid thy wish. Looking aloft
4724,CANTO XXXI,"To the third circle from the highest, there"
4725,CANTO XXXI,"Behold her on the throne, wherein her merit"
4726,CANTO XXXI,"Hath plac’d her.” Answering not, mine eyes I rais’d,"
4727,CANTO XXXI,"And saw her, where aloof she sat, her brow"
4728,CANTO XXXI,A wreath reflecting of eternal beams.
4729,CANTO XXXI,Not from the centre of the sea so far
4730,CANTO XXXI,"Unto the region of the highest thunder,"
4731,CANTO XXXI,As was my ken from hers; and yet the form
4732,CANTO XXXI,"Came through that medium down, unmix’d and pure,"
4733,CANTO XXXI,
4734,CANTO XXXI,“O Lady! thou in whom my hopes have rest!
4735,CANTO XXXI,"Who, for my safety, hast not scorn’d, in hell"
4736,CANTO XXXI,To leave the traces of thy footsteps mark’d!
4737,CANTO XXXI,"For all mine eyes have seen, I, to thy power"
4738,CANTO XXXI,"And goodness, virtue owe and grace. Of slave,"
4739,CANTO XXXI,"Thou hast to freedom brought me; and no means,"
4740,CANTO XXXI,"For my deliverance apt, hast left untried."
4741,CANTO XXXI,Thy liberal bounty still toward me keep.
4742,CANTO XXXI,"That, when my spirit, which thou madest whole,"
4743,CANTO XXXI,"Is loosen’d from this body, it may find"
4744,CANTO XXXI,Favour with thee.” So I my suit preferr’d:
4745,CANTO XXXI,"And she, so distant, as appear’d, look’d down,"
4746,CANTO XXXI,And smil’d; then tow’rds th’ eternal fountain turn’d.
4747,CANTO XXXI,
4748,CANTO XXXI,"And thus the senior, holy and rever’d:"
4749,CANTO XXXI,“That thou at length mayst happily conclude
4750,CANTO XXXI,"Thy voyage (to which end I was dispatch’d,"
4751,CANTO XXXI,By supplication mov’d and holy love)
4752,CANTO XXXI,"Let thy upsoaring vision range, at large,"
4753,CANTO XXXI,"This garden through: for so, by ray divine"
4754,CANTO XXXI,"Kindled, thy ken a higher flight shall mount;"
4755,CANTO XXXI,"And from heav’n’s queen, whom fervent I adore,"
4756,CANTO XXXI,All gracious aid befriend us; for that I
4757,CANTO XXXI,"Am her own faithful Bernard.” Like a wight,"
4758,CANTO XXXI,Who haply from Croatia wends to see
4759,CANTO XXXI,"Our Veronica, and the while ’tis shown,"
4760,CANTO XXXI,"Hangs over it with never-sated gaze,"
4761,CANTO XXXI,"And, all that he hath heard revolving, saith"
4762,CANTO XXXI,Unto himself in thought: “And didst thou look
4763,CANTO XXXI,"E’en thus, O Jesus, my true Lord and God?"
4764,CANTO XXXI,And was this semblance thine?” So gaz’d I then
4765,CANTO XXXI,"Adoring; for the charity of him,"
4766,CANTO XXXI,"Who musing, in the world that peace enjoy’d,"
4767,CANTO XXXI,Stood lively before me. “Child of grace!”
4768,CANTO XXXI,Thus he began: “thou shalt not knowledge gain
4769,CANTO XXXI,"Of this glad being, if thine eyes are held"
4770,CANTO XXXI,Still in this depth below. But search around
4771,CANTO XXXI,"The circles, to the furthest, till thou spy"
4772,CANTO XXXI,"Seated in state, the queen, that of this realm"
4773,CANTO XXXI,"Is sovran.” Straight mine eyes I rais’d; and bright,"
4774,CANTO XXXI,"As, at the birth of morn, the eastern clime"
4775,CANTO XXXI,"Above th’ horizon, where the sun declines;"
4776,CANTO XXXI,"To mine eyes, that upward, as from vale"
4777,CANTO XXXI,"To mountain sped, at th’ extreme bound, a part"
4778,CANTO XXXI,Excell’d in lustre all the front oppos’d.
4779,CANTO XXXI,"And as the glow burns ruddiest o’er the wave,"
4780,CANTO XXXI,"That waits the sloping beam, which Phaeton"
4781,CANTO XXXI,"Ill knew to guide, and on each part the light"
4782,CANTO XXXI,"Diminish’d fades, intensest in the midst;"
4783,CANTO XXXI,"So burn’d the peaceful oriflame, and slack’d"
4784,CANTO XXXI,On every side the living flame decay’d.
4785,CANTO XXXI,And in that midst their sportive pennons wav’d
4786,CANTO XXXI,Thousands of angels; in resplendence each
4787,CANTO XXXI,"Distinct, and quaint adornment. At their glee"
4788,CANTO XXXI,"And carol, smil’d the Lovely One of heav’n,"
4789,CANTO XXXI,That joy was in the eyes of all the blest.
4790,CANTO XXXI,
4791,CANTO XXXI,"Had I a tongue in eloquence as rich,"
4792,CANTO XXXI,"As is the colouring in fancy’s loom,"
4793,CANTO XXXI,’Twere all too poor to utter the least part
4794,CANTO XXXI,Of that enchantment. When he saw mine eyes
4795,CANTO XXXI,"Intent on her, that charm’d him, Bernard gaz’d"
4796,CANTO XXXI,"With so exceeding fondness, as infus’d"
4797,CANTO XXXI,"Ardour into my breast, unfelt before."
4798,CANTO XXXI,
4799,CANTO XXXI,
4800,CANTO XXXI,
4801,CANTO XXXI,
4802,CANTO XXXII,CANTO XXXII
4803,CANTO XXXII,
4804,CANTO XXXII,
4805,CANTO XXXII,"Freely the sage, though wrapt in musings high,"
4806,CANTO XXXII,"Assum’d the teacher’s part, and mild began:"
4807,CANTO XXXII,"“The wound, that Mary clos’d, she open’d first,"
4808,CANTO XXXII,Who sits so beautiful at Mary’s feet.
4809,CANTO XXXII,"The third in order, underneath her, lo!"
4810,CANTO XXXII,"Rachel with Beatrice. Sarah next,"
4811,CANTO XXXII,"Judith, Rebecca, and the gleaner maid,"
4812,CANTO XXXII,"Meek ancestress of him, who sang the songs"
4813,CANTO XXXII,Of sore repentance in his sorrowful mood.
4814,CANTO XXXII,"All, as I name them, down from deaf to leaf,"
4815,CANTO XXXII,Are in gradation throned on the rose.
4816,CANTO XXXII,"And from the seventh step, successively,"
4817,CANTO XXXII,Adown the breathing tresses of the flow’r
4818,CANTO XXXII,Still doth the file of Hebrew dames proceed.
4819,CANTO XXXII,"For these are a partition wall, whereby"
4820,CANTO XXXII,"The sacred stairs are sever’d, as the faith"
4821,CANTO XXXII,"In Christ divides them. On this part, where blooms"
4822,CANTO XXXII,"Each leaf in full maturity, are set"
4823,CANTO XXXII,"Such as in Christ, or ere he came, believ’d."
4824,CANTO XXXII,"On th’ other, where an intersected space"
4825,CANTO XXXII,"Yet shows the semicircle void, abide"
4826,CANTO XXXII,"All they, who look’d to Christ already come."
4827,CANTO XXXII,"And as our Lady on her glorious stool,"
4828,CANTO XXXII,"And they who on their stools beneath her sit,"
4829,CANTO XXXII,"This way distinction make: e’en so on his,"
4830,CANTO XXXII,The mighty Baptist that way marks the line
4831,CANTO XXXII,(He who endur’d the desert and the pains
4832,CANTO XXXII,"Of martyrdom, and for two years of hell,"
4833,CANTO XXXII,"Yet still continued holy), and beneath,"
4834,CANTO XXXII,"Augustin, Francis, Benedict, and the rest,"
4835,CANTO XXXII,Thus far from round to round. So heav’n’s decree
4836,CANTO XXXII,"Forecasts, this garden equally to fill."
4837,CANTO XXXII,"With faith in either view, past or to come,"
4838,CANTO XXXII,"Learn too, that downward from the step, which cleaves"
4839,CANTO XXXII,"Midway the twain compartments, none there are"
4840,CANTO XXXII,"Who place obtain for merit of their own,"
4841,CANTO XXXII,"But have through others’ merit been advanc’d,"
4842,CANTO XXXII,"On set conditions: spirits all releas’d,"
4843,CANTO XXXII,Ere for themselves they had the power to choose.
4844,CANTO XXXII,"And, if thou mark and listen to them well,"
4845,CANTO XXXII,Their childish looks and voice declare as much.
4846,CANTO XXXII,
4847,CANTO XXXII,"“Here, silent as thou art, I know thy doubt;"
4848,CANTO XXXII,"And gladly will I loose the knot, wherein"
4849,CANTO XXXII,Thy subtle thoughts have bound thee. From this realm
4850,CANTO XXXII,"Excluded, chalice no entrance here may find,"
4851,CANTO XXXII,"No more shall hunger, thirst, or sorrow can."
4852,CANTO XXXII,A law immutable hath establish’d all;
4853,CANTO XXXII,"Nor is there aught thou seest, that doth not fit,"
4854,CANTO XXXII,"Exactly, as the finger to the ring."
4855,CANTO XXXII,"It is not therefore without cause, that these,"
4856,CANTO XXXII,"O’erspeedy comers to immortal life,"
4857,CANTO XXXII,Are different in their shares of excellence.
4858,CANTO XXXII,Our Sovran Lord—that settleth this estate
4859,CANTO XXXII,"In love and in delight so absolute,"
4860,CANTO XXXII,"That wish can dare no further—every soul,"
4861,CANTO XXXII,"Created in his joyous sight to dwell,"
4862,CANTO XXXII,With grace at pleasure variously endows.
4863,CANTO XXXII,And for a proof th’ effect may well suffice.
4864,CANTO XXXII,And ’tis moreover most expressly mark’d
4865,CANTO XXXII,"In holy scripture, where the twins are said"
4866,CANTO XXXII,"To, have struggled in the womb. Therefore, as grace"
4867,CANTO XXXII,"Inweaves the coronet, so every brow"
4868,CANTO XXXII,Weareth its proper hue of orient light.
4869,CANTO XXXII,"And merely in respect to his prime gift,"
4870,CANTO XXXII,"Not in reward of meritorious deed,"
4871,CANTO XXXII,Hath each his several degree assign’d.
4872,CANTO XXXII,In early times with their own innocence
4873,CANTO XXXII,"More was not wanting, than the parents’ faith,"
4874,CANTO XXXII,"To save them: those first ages past, behoov’d"
4875,CANTO XXXII,That circumcision in the males should imp
4876,CANTO XXXII,The flight of innocent wings: but since the day
4877,CANTO XXXII,"Of grace hath come, without baptismal rites"
4878,CANTO XXXII,"In Christ accomplish’d, innocence herself"
4879,CANTO XXXII,Must linger yet below. Now raise thy view
4880,CANTO XXXII,Unto the visage most resembling Christ:
4881,CANTO XXXII,"For, in her splendour only, shalt thou win"
4882,CANTO XXXII,The pow’r to look on him.” Forthwith I saw
4883,CANTO XXXII,"Such floods of gladness on her visage shower’d,"
4884,CANTO XXXII,"From holy spirits, winging that profound;"
4885,CANTO XXXII,"That, whatsoever I had yet beheld,"
4886,CANTO XXXII,"Had not so much suspended me with wonder,"
4887,CANTO XXXII,Or shown me such similitude of God.
4888,CANTO XXXII,"And he, who had to her descended, once,"
4889,CANTO XXXII,"On earth, now hail’d in heav’n; and on pois’d wing."
4890,CANTO XXXII,"“Ave, Maria, Gratia Plena,” sang:"
4891,CANTO XXXII,"To whose sweet anthem all the blissful court,"
4892,CANTO XXXII,"From all parts answ’ring, rang: that holier joy"
4893,CANTO XXXII,Brooded the deep serene. “Father rever’d:
4894,CANTO XXXII,"Who deign’st, for me, to quit the pleasant place,"
4895,CANTO XXXII,"Wherein thou sittest, by eternal lot!"
4896,CANTO XXXII,"Say, who that angel is, that with such glee"
4897,CANTO XXXII,"Beholds our queen, and so enamour’d glows"
4898,CANTO XXXII,"Of her high beauty, that all fire he seems.”"
4899,CANTO XXXII,So I again resorted to the lore
4900,CANTO XXXII,"Of my wise teacher, he, whom Mary’s charms"
4901,CANTO XXXII,"Embellish’d, as the sun the morning star;"
4902,CANTO XXXII,"Who thus in answer spake: “In him are summ’d,"
4903,CANTO XXXII,Whatever of buxomness and free delight
4904,CANTO XXXII,"May be in Spirit, or in angel, met:"
4905,CANTO XXXII,And so beseems: for that he bare the palm
4906,CANTO XXXII,"Down unto Mary, when the Son of God"
4907,CANTO XXXII,Vouchsaf’d to clothe him in terrestrial weeds.
4908,CANTO XXXII,"Now let thine eyes wait heedful on my words,"
4909,CANTO XXXII,And note thou of this just and pious realm
4910,CANTO XXXII,"The chiefest nobles. Those, highest in bliss,"
4911,CANTO XXXII,"The twain, on each hand next our empress thron’d,"
4912,CANTO XXXII,Are as it were two roots unto this rose.
4913,CANTO XXXII,"He to the left, the parent, whose rash taste"
4914,CANTO XXXII,"Proves bitter to his seed; and, on the right,"
4915,CANTO XXXII,"That ancient father of the holy church,"
4916,CANTO XXXII,Into whose keeping Christ did give the keys
4917,CANTO XXXII,"Of this sweet flow’r: near whom behold the seer,"
4918,CANTO XXXII,"That, ere he died, saw all the grievous times"
4919,CANTO XXXII,"Of the fair bride, who with the lance and nails"
4920,CANTO XXXII,"Was won. And, near unto the other, rests"
4921,CANTO XXXII,"The leader, under whom on manna fed"
4922,CANTO XXXII,"Th’ ungrateful nation, fickle and perverse."
4923,CANTO XXXII,"On th’ other part, facing to Peter, lo!"
4924,CANTO XXXII,"Where Anna sits, so well content to look"
4925,CANTO XXXII,"On her lov’d daughter, that with moveless eye"
4926,CANTO XXXII,"She chants the loud hosanna: while, oppos’d"
4927,CANTO XXXII,"To the first father of your mortal kind,"
4928,CANTO XXXII,"Is Lucia, at whose hest thy lady sped,"
4929,CANTO XXXII,When on the edge of ruin clos’d thine eye.
4930,CANTO XXXII,
4931,CANTO XXXII,“But (for the vision hasteneth so an end)
4932,CANTO XXXII,"Here break we off, as the good workman doth,"
4933,CANTO XXXII,That shapes the cloak according to the cloth:
4934,CANTO XXXII,And to the primal love our ken shall rise;
4935,CANTO XXXII,"That thou mayst penetrate the brightness, far"
4936,CANTO XXXII,"As sight can bear thee. Yet, alas! in sooth"
4937,CANTO XXXII,"Beating thy pennons, thinking to advance,"
4938,CANTO XXXII,Thou backward fall’st. Grace then must first be gain’d;
4939,CANTO XXXII,"Her grace, whose might can help thee. Thou in prayer"
4940,CANTO XXXII,"Seek her: and, with affection, whilst I sue,"
4941,CANTO XXXII,"Attend, and yield me all thy heart.” He said,"
4942,CANTO XXXII,And thus the saintly orison began.
4943,CANTO XXXII,

4947,CANTO XXXIII,CANTO XXXIII
4948,CANTO XXXIII,
4949,CANTO XXXIII,
4950,CANTO XXXIII,"“O virgin mother, daughter of thy Son,"
4951,CANTO XXXIII,Created beings all in lowliness
4952,CANTO XXXIII,"Surpassing, as in height, above them all,"
4953,CANTO XXXIII,"Term by th’ eternal counsel pre-ordain’d,"
4954,CANTO XXXIII,"Ennobler of thy nature, so advanc’d"
4955,CANTO XXXIII,"In thee, that its great Maker did not scorn,"
4956,CANTO XXXIII,"Himself, in his own work enclos’d to dwell!"
4957,CANTO XXXIII,For in thy womb rekindling shone the love
4958,CANTO XXXIII,"Reveal’d, whose genial influence makes now"
4959,CANTO XXXIII,This flower to germin in eternal peace!
4960,CANTO XXXIII,"Here thou to us, of charity and love,"
4961,CANTO XXXIII,"Art, as the noon-day torch: and art, beneath,"
4962,CANTO XXXIII,"To mortal men, of hope a living spring."
4963,CANTO XXXIII,"So mighty art thou, lady! and so great,"
4964,CANTO XXXIII,"That he who grace desireth, and comes not"
4965,CANTO XXXIII,"To thee for aidance, fain would have desire"
4966,CANTO XXXIII,"Fly without wings. Nor only him who asks,"
4967,CANTO XXXIII,"Thy bounty succours, but doth freely oft"
4968,CANTO XXXIII,Forerun the asking. Whatsoe’er may be
4969,CANTO XXXIII,"Of excellence in creature, pity mild,"
4970,CANTO XXXIII,"Relenting mercy, large munificence,"
4971,CANTO XXXIII,"Are all combin’d in thee. Here kneeleth one,"
4972,CANTO XXXIII,"Who of all spirits hath review’d the state,"
4973,CANTO XXXIII,From the world’s lowest gap unto this height.
4974,CANTO XXXIII,"Suppliant to thee he kneels, imploring grace"
4975,CANTO XXXIII,"For virtue, yet more high to lift his ken"
4976,CANTO XXXIII,"Toward the bliss supreme. And I, who ne’er"
4977,CANTO XXXIII,"Coveted sight, more fondly, for myself,"
4978,CANTO XXXIII,"Than now for him, my prayers to thee prefer,"
4979,CANTO XXXIII,(And pray they be not scant) that thou wouldst drive
4980,CANTO XXXIII,Each cloud of his mortality away;
4981,CANTO XXXIII,That on the sovran pleasure he may gaze.
4982,CANTO XXXIII,"This also I entreat of thee, O queen!"
4983,CANTO XXXIII,Who canst do what thou wilt! that in him thou
4984,CANTO XXXIII,"Wouldst after all he hath beheld, preserve"
4985,CANTO XXXIII,"Affection sound, and human passions quell."
4986,CANTO XXXIII,"Lo! Where, with Beatrice, many a saint"
4987,CANTO XXXIII,"Stretch their clasp’d hands, in furtherance of my suit!”"
4988,CANTO XXXIII,
4989,CANTO XXXIII,"The eyes, that heav’n with love and awe regards,"
4990,CANTO XXXIII,"Fix’d on the suitor, witness’d, how benign"
4991,CANTO XXXIII,She looks on pious pray’rs: then fasten’d they
4992,CANTO XXXIII,"On th’ everlasting light, wherein no eye"
4993,CANTO XXXIII,"Of creature, as may well be thought, so far"
4994,CANTO XXXIII,"Can travel inward. I, meanwhile, who drew"
4995,CANTO XXXIII,"Near to the limit, where all wishes end,"
4996,CANTO XXXIII,"The ardour of my wish (for so behooved),"
4997,CANTO XXXIII,"Ended within me. Beck’ning smil’d the sage,"
4998,CANTO XXXIII,"That I should look aloft: but, ere he bade,"
4999,CANTO XXXIII,Already of myself aloft I look’d;
5000,CANTO XXXIII,"For visual strength, refining more and more,"
5001,CANTO XXXIII,Bare me into the ray authentical
5002,CANTO XXXIII,"Of sovran light. Thenceforward, what I saw,"
5003,CANTO XXXIII,"Was not for words to speak, nor memory’s self"
5004,CANTO XXXIII,To stand against such outrage on her skill.
5005,CANTO XXXIII,"As one, who from a dream awaken’d, straight,"
5006,CANTO XXXIII,All he hath seen forgets; yet still retains
5007,CANTO XXXIII,Impression of the feeling in his dream;
5008,CANTO XXXIII,"E’en such am I: for all the vision dies,"
5009,CANTO XXXIII,"As ’twere, away; and yet the sense of sweet,"
5010,CANTO XXXIII,"That sprang from it, still trickles in my heart."
5011,CANTO XXXIII,Thus in the sun-thaw is the snow unseal’d;
5012,CANTO XXXIII,Thus in the winds on flitting leaves was lost
5013,CANTO XXXIII,The Sybil’s sentence. O eternal beam!
5014,CANTO XXXIII,(Whose height what reach of mortal thought may soar?)
5015,CANTO XXXIII,Yield me again some little particle
5016,CANTO XXXIII,"Of what thou then appearedst, give my tongue"
5017,CANTO XXXIII,"Power, but to leave one sparkle of thy glory,"
5018,CANTO XXXIII,"Unto the race to come, that shall not lose"
5019,CANTO XXXIII,"Thy triumph wholly, if thou waken aught"
5020,CANTO XXXIII,"Of memory in me, and endure to hear"
5021,CANTO XXXIII,The record sound in this unequal strain.
5022,CANTO XXXIII,
5023,CANTO XXXIII,"Such keenness from the living ray I met,"
5024,CANTO XXXIII,"That, if mine eyes had turn’d away, methinks,"
5025,CANTO XXXIII,"I had been lost; but, so embolden’d, on"
5026,CANTO XXXIII,"I pass’d, as I remember, till my view"
5027,CANTO XXXIII,Hover’d the brink of dread infinitude.
5028,CANTO XXXIII,
5029,CANTO XXXIII,O grace! unenvying of thy boon! that gav’st
5030,CANTO XXXIII,Boldness to fix so earnestly my ken
5031,CANTO XXXIII,"On th’ everlasting splendour, that I look’d,"
5032,CANTO XXXIII,"While sight was unconsum’d, and, in that depth,"
5033,CANTO XXXIII,"Saw in one volume clasp’d of love, whatever"
5034,CANTO XXXIII,The universe unfolds; all properties
5035,CANTO XXXIII,"Of substance and of accident, beheld,"
5036,CANTO XXXIII,"Compounded, yet one individual light"
5037,CANTO XXXIII,The whole. And of such bond methinks I saw
5038,CANTO XXXIII,The universal form: for that whenever
5039,CANTO XXXIII,"I do but speak of it, my soul dilates"
5040,CANTO XXXIII,"Beyond her proper self; and, till I speak,"
5041,CANTO XXXIII,"One moment seems a longer lethargy,"
5042,CANTO XXXIII,Than five-and-twenty ages had appear’d
5043,CANTO XXXIII,"To that emprize, that first made Neptune wonder"
5044,CANTO XXXIII,At Argo’s shadow darkening on his flood.
5045,CANTO XXXIII,
5046,CANTO XXXIII,"With fixed heed, suspense and motionless,"
5047,CANTO XXXIII,Wond’ring I gaz’d; and admiration still
5048,CANTO XXXIII,"Was kindled, as I gaz’d. It may not be,"
5049,CANTO XXXIII,"That one, who looks upon that light, can turn"
5050,CANTO XXXIII,"To other object, willingly, his view."
5051,CANTO XXXIII,"For all the good, that will may covet, there"
5052,CANTO XXXIII,"Is summ’d; and all, elsewhere defective found,"
5053,CANTO XXXIII,"Complete. My tongue shall utter now, no more"
5054,CANTO XXXIII,"E’en what remembrance keeps, than could the babe’s"
5055,CANTO XXXIII,That yet is moisten’d at his mother’s breast.
5056,CANTO XXXIII,Not that the semblance of the living light
5057,CANTO XXXIII,Was chang’d (that ever as at first remain’d)
5058,CANTO XXXIII,"But that my vision quickening, in that sole"
5059,CANTO XXXIII,"Appearance, still new miracles descry’d,"
5060,CANTO XXXIII,And toil’d me with the change. In that abyss
5061,CANTO XXXIII,"Of radiance, clear and lofty, seem’d methought,"
5062,CANTO XXXIII,Three orbs of triple hue clipt in one bound:
5063,CANTO XXXIII,"And, from another, one reflected seem’d,"
5064,CANTO XXXIII,As rainbow is from rainbow: and the third
5065,CANTO XXXIII,"Seem’d fire, breath’d equally from both. Oh speech"
5066,CANTO XXXIII,"How feeble and how faint art thou, to give"
5067,CANTO XXXIII,Conception birth! Yet this to what I saw
5068,CANTO XXXIII,Is less than little. Oh eternal light!
5069,CANTO XXXIII,Sole in thyself that dwellst; and of thyself
5070,CANTO XXXIII,"Sole understood, past, present, or to come!"
5071,CANTO XXXIII,"Thou smiledst; on that circling, which in thee"
5072,CANTO XXXIII,"Seem’d as reflected splendour, while I mus’d;"
5073,CANTO XXXIII,"For I therein, methought, in its own hue"
5074,CANTO XXXIII,Beheld our image painted: steadfastly
5075,CANTO XXXIII,I therefore por’d upon the view. As one
5076,CANTO XXXIII,"Who vers’d in geometric lore, would fain"
5077,CANTO XXXIII,"Measure the circle; and, though pondering long"
5078,CANTO XXXIII,"And deeply, that beginning, which he needs,"
5079,CANTO XXXIII,"Finds not; e’en such was I, intent to scan"
5080,CANTO XXXIII,"The novel wonder, and trace out the form,"
5081,CANTO XXXIII,"How to the circle fitted, and therein"
5082,CANTO XXXIII,How plac’d: but the flight was not for my wing;
5083,CANTO XXXIII,"Had not a flash darted athwart my mind,"
5084,CANTO XXXIII,And in the spleen unfolded what it sought.
5085,CANTO XXXIII,
5086,CANTO XXXIII,Here vigour fail’d the tow’ring fantasy:
5087,CANTO XXXIII,"But yet the will roll’d onward, like a wheel"
5088,CANTO XXXIII,"In even motion, by the Love impell’d,"
5089,CANTO XXXIII,That moves the sun in heav’n and all the stars.
