42,CANTO VII,
43,CANTO VII,"""AH me!  O Satan!  Satan!"" loud exclaim'd"
44,CANTO VII,"Plutus, in accent hoarse of wild alarm:"
45,CANTO VII,"And the kind sage, whom no event surpris'd,"
46,CANTO VII,"To comfort me thus spake: ""Let not thy fear"
47,CANTO VII,"Harm thee, for power in him, be sure, is none"
48,CANTO VII,"To hinder down this rock thy safe descent."""
49,CANTO VII,"Then to that sworn lip turning, ""Peace!""  he cried,"
50,CANTO VII,
51,CANTO VII,"""Curs'd wolf! thy fury inward on thyself"
52,CANTO VII,"Prey, and consume thee!  Through the dark profound"
53,CANTO VII,Not without cause he passes.  So 't is will'd
54,CANTO VII,"On high, there where the great Archangel pour'd"
55,CANTO VII,"Heav'n's vengeance on the first adulterer proud."""
56,CANTO VII,
57,CANTO VII,As sails full spread and bellying with the wind
58,CANTO VII,"Drop suddenly collaps'd, if the mast split;"
59,CANTO VII,So to the ground down dropp'd the cruel fiend.
60,CANTO VII,
61,CANTO VII,"Thus we, descending to the fourth steep ledge,"
62,CANTO VII,"Gain'd on the dismal shore, that all the woe"
63,CANTO VII,Hems in of all the universe.  Ah me!
64,CANTO VII,Almighty Justice! in what store thou heap'st
65,CANTO VII,"New pains, new troubles, as I here beheld!"
66,CANTO VII,Wherefore doth fault of ours bring us to this?
67,CANTO VII,
68,CANTO VII,"E'en as a billow, on Charybdis rising,"
69,CANTO VII,Against encounter'd billow dashing breaks;
70,CANTO VII,"Such is the dance this wretched race must lead,"
71,CANTO VII,"Whom more than elsewhere numerous here I found,"
72,CANTO VII,"From one side and the other, with loud voice,"
73,CANTO VII,"Both roll'd on weights by main forge of their breasts,"
74,CANTO VII,"Then smote together, and each one forthwith"
75,CANTO VII,"Roll'd them back voluble, turning again,"
76,CANTO VII,"Exclaiming these, ""Why holdest thou so fast?"""
77,CANTO VII,"Those answering, ""And why castest thou away?"""
78,CANTO VII,"So still repeating their despiteful song,"
79,CANTO VII,They to the opposite point on either hand
80,CANTO VII,"Travers'd the horrid circle: then arriv'd,"
81,CANTO VII,"Both turn'd them round, and through the middle space"
82,CANTO VII,Conflicting met again.  At sight whereof
83,CANTO VII,"I, stung with grief, thus spake: ""O say, my guide!"
84,CANTO VII,"What race is this?  Were these, whose heads are shorn,"
85,CANTO VII,"On our left hand, all sep'rate to the church?"""
86,CANTO VII,
87,CANTO VII,"He straight replied: ""In their first life these all"
88,CANTO VII,"In mind were so distorted, that they made,"
89,CANTO VII,"According to due measure, of their wealth,"
90,CANTO VII,"No use.  This clearly from their words collect,"
91,CANTO VII,"Which they howl forth, at each extremity"
92,CANTO VII,"Arriving of the circle, where their crime"
93,CANTO VII,Contrary' in kind disparts them.  To the church
94,CANTO VII,"Were separate those, that with no hairy cowls"
95,CANTO VII,"Are crown'd, both Popes and Cardinals, o'er whom"
96,CANTO VII,"Av'rice dominion absolute maintains."""
97,CANTO VII,
98,CANTO VII,"I then: ""Mid such as these some needs must be,"
99,CANTO VII,"Whom I shall recognize, that with the blot"
100,CANTO VII,"Of these foul sins were stain'd.""  He answering thus:"
101,CANTO VII,"""Vain thought conceiv'st thou.  That ignoble life,"
102,CANTO VII,"Which made them vile before, now makes them dark,"
103,CANTO VII,And to all knowledge indiscernible.
104,CANTO VII,Forever they shall meet in this rude shock:
105,CANTO VII,"These from the tomb with clenched grasp shall rise,"
106,CANTO VII,"Those with close-shaven locks.  That ill they gave,"
107,CANTO VII,"And ill they kept, hath of the beauteous world"
108,CANTO VII,"Depriv'd, and set them at this strife, which needs"
109,CANTO VII,No labour'd phrase of mine to set if off.
110,CANTO VII,"Now may'st thou see, my son! how brief, how vain,"
111,CANTO VII,"The goods committed into fortune's hands,"
112,CANTO VII,For which the human race keep such a coil!
113,CANTO VII,"Not all the gold, that is beneath the moon,"
114,CANTO VII,"Or ever hath been, of these toil-worn souls"
115,CANTO VII,"Might purchase rest for one.""  I thus rejoin'd:"
116,CANTO VII,
117,CANTO VII,"""My guide! of thee this also would I learn;"
118,CANTO VII,"This fortune, that thou speak'st of, what it is,"
119,CANTO VII,"Whose talons grasp the blessings of the world?"""
120,CANTO VII,
121,CANTO VII,"He thus: ""O beings blind! what ignorance"
122,CANTO VII,Besets you?  Now my judgment hear and mark.
123,CANTO VII,"He, whose transcendent wisdom passes all,"
124,CANTO VII,"The heavens creating, gave them ruling powers"
125,CANTO VII,"To guide them, so that each part shines to each,"
126,CANTO VII,Their light in equal distribution pour'd.
127,CANTO VII,By similar appointment he ordain'd
128,CANTO VII,Over the world's bright images to rule.
129,CANTO VII,Superintendence of a guiding hand
130,CANTO VII,"And general minister, which at due time"
131,CANTO VII,May change the empty vantages of life
132,CANTO VII,"From race to race, from one to other's blood,"
133,CANTO VII,Beyond prevention of man's wisest care:
134,CANTO VII,"Wherefore one nation rises into sway,"
135,CANTO VII,"Another languishes, e'en as her will"
136,CANTO VII,"Decrees, from us conceal'd, as in the grass"
137,CANTO VII,The serpent train.  Against her nought avails
138,CANTO VII,"Your utmost wisdom.  She with foresight plans,"
139,CANTO VII,"Judges, and carries on her reign, as theirs"
140,CANTO VII,The other powers divine.  Her changes know
141,CANTO VII,Nore intermission: by necessity
142,CANTO VII,"She is made swift, so frequent come who claim"
143,CANTO VII,"Succession in her favours.  This is she,"
144,CANTO VII,"So execrated e'en by those, whose debt"
145,CANTO VII,To her is rather praise; they wrongfully
146,CANTO VII,"With blame requite her, and with evil word;"
147,CANTO VII,"But she is blessed, and for that recks not:"
148,CANTO VII,Amidst the other primal beings glad
149,CANTO VII,"Rolls on her sphere, and in her bliss exults."
150,CANTO VII,"Now on our way pass we, to heavier woe"
151,CANTO VII,"Descending: for each star is falling now,"
152,CANTO VII,"That mounted at our entrance, and forbids"
153,CANTO VII,"Too long our tarrying.""  We the circle cross'd"
154,CANTO VII,"To the next steep, arriving at a well,"
155,CANTO VII,That boiling pours itself down to a foss
156,CANTO VII,Sluic'd from its source.  Far murkier was the wave
157,CANTO VII,Than sablest grain: and we in company
158,CANTO VII,"Of the' inky waters, journeying by their side,"
159,CANTO VII,"Enter'd, though by a different track, beneath."
160,CANTO VII,"Into a lake, the Stygian nam'd, expands"
161,CANTO VII,"The dismal stream, when it hath reach'd the foot"
162,CANTO VII,Of the grey wither'd cliffs.  Intent I stood
163,CANTO VII,"To gaze, and in the marish sunk descried"
164,CANTO VII,"A miry tribe, all naked, and with looks"
165,CANTO VII,Betok'ning rage.  They with their hands alone
166,CANTO VII,"Struck not, but with the head, the breast, the feet,"
167,CANTO VII,Cutting each other piecemeal with their fangs.
168,CANTO VII,
169,CANTO VII,"The good instructor spake; ""Now seest thou, son!"
170,CANTO VII,"The souls of those, whom anger overcame."
171,CANTO VII,"This too for certain know, that underneath"
172,CANTO VII,"The water dwells a multitude, whose sighs"
173,CANTO VII,"Into these bubbles make the surface heave,"
174,CANTO VII,"As thine eye tells thee wheresoe'er it turn."""
175,CANTO VII,"Fix'd in the slime they say: ""Sad once were we"
176,CANTO VII,"In the sweet air made gladsome by the sun,"
177,CANTO VII,Carrying a foul and lazy mist within:
178,CANTO VII,"Now in these murky settlings are we sad."""
179,CANTO VII,Such dolorous strain they gurgle in their throats.
180,CANTO VII,"But word distinct can utter none.""  Our route"
181,CANTO VII,"Thus compass'd we, a segment widely stretch'd"
182,CANTO VII,"Between the dry embankment, and the core"
183,CANTO VII,"Of the loath'd pool, turning meanwhile our eyes"
184,CANTO VII,Downward on those who gulp'd its muddy lees;
185,CANTO VII,"Nor stopp'd, till to a tower's low base we came."
186,CANTO VII,
187,CANTO VII,
188,CANTO VII,
189,CANTO VII,
190,CANTO VIII,CANTO VIII
191,CANTO VIII,
192,CANTO VIII,"MY theme pursuing, I relate that ere"
193,CANTO VIII,"We reach'd the lofty turret's base, our eyes"
194,CANTO VIII,"Its height ascended, where two cressets hung"
195,CANTO VIII,"We mark'd, and from afar another light"
196,CANTO VIII,"Return the signal, so remote, that scarce"
197,CANTO VIII,The eye could catch its beam.  I turning round
198,CANTO VIII,"To the deep source of knowledge, thus inquir'd:"
199,CANTO VIII,"""Say what this means?  and what that other light"
200,CANTO VIII,"In answer set?  what agency doth this?"""
201,CANTO VIII,
202,CANTO VIII,"""There on the filthy waters,"" he replied,"
203,CANTO VIII,"""E'en now what next awaits us mayst thou see,"
204,CANTO VIII,"If the marsh-gender'd fog conceal it not."""
205,CANTO VIII,
206,CANTO VIII,"Never was arrow from the cord dismiss'd,"
207,CANTO VIII,"That ran its way so nimbly through the air,"
208,CANTO VIII,"As a small bark, that through the waves I spied"
209,CANTO VIII,"Toward us coming, under the sole sway"
210,CANTO VIII,"Of one that ferried it, who cried aloud:"
211,CANTO VIII,"""Art thou arriv'd, fell spirit?""--""Phlegyas, Phlegyas,"
212,CANTO VIII,"This time thou criest in vain,"" my lord replied;"
213,CANTO VIII,"""No longer shalt thou have us, but while o'er"
214,CANTO VIII,"The slimy pool we pass.""  As one who hears"
215,CANTO VIII,"Of some great wrong he hath sustain'd, whereat"
216,CANTO VIII,Inly he pines; so Phlegyas inly pin'd
217,CANTO VIII,In his fierce ire.  My guide descending stepp'd
218,CANTO VIII,"Into the skiff, and bade me enter next"
219,CANTO VIII,Close at his side; nor till my entrance seem'd
220,CANTO VIII,"The vessel freighted.  Soon as both embark'd,"
221,CANTO VIII,"Cutting the waves, goes on the ancient prow,"
222,CANTO VIII,More deeply than with others it is wont.
223,CANTO VIII,
224,CANTO VIII,While we our course o'er the dead channel held.
225,CANTO VIII,"One drench'd in mire before me came, and said;"
226,CANTO VIII,"""Who art thou, that thou comest ere thine hour?"""
227,CANTO VIII,
228,CANTO VIII,"I answer'd: ""Though I come, I tarry not;"
229,CANTO VIII,"But who art thou, that art become so foul?"""
230,CANTO VIII,
231,CANTO VIII,"""One, as thou seest, who mourn:"" he straight replied."
232,CANTO VIII,
233,CANTO VIII,"To which I thus: ""In mourning and in woe,"
234,CANTO VIII,"Curs'd spirit! tarry thou.g I know thee well,"
235,CANTO VIII,"E'en thus in filth disguis'd.""  Then stretch'd he forth"
236,CANTO VIII,Hands to the bark; whereof my teacher sage
237,CANTO VIII,"Aware, thrusting him back: ""Away! down there;"
238,CANTO VIII,
239,CANTO VIII,"""To the' other dogs!"" then, with his arms my neck"
240,CANTO VIII,"Encircling, kiss'd my cheek, and spake: ""O soul"
241,CANTO VIII,Justly disdainful! blest was she in whom
242,CANTO VIII,Thou was conceiv'd!  He in the world was one
243,CANTO VIII,For arrogance noted; to his memory
244,CANTO VIII,No virtue lends its lustre; even so
245,CANTO VIII,Here is his shadow furious.  There above
246,CANTO VIII,How many now hold themselves mighty kings
247,CANTO VIII,"Who here like swine shall wallow in the mire,"
248,CANTO VIII,"Leaving behind them horrible dispraise!"""
249,CANTO VIII,
250,CANTO VIII,"I then: ""Master! him fain would I behold"
251,CANTO VIII,"Whelm'd in these dregs, before we quit the lake."""
252,CANTO VIII,
253,CANTO VIII,"He thus: ""Or ever to thy view the shore"
254,CANTO VIII,"Be offer'd, satisfied shall be that wish,"
255,CANTO VIII,"Which well deserves completion.""  Scarce his words"
256,CANTO VIII,"Were ended, when I saw the miry tribes"
257,CANTO VIII,"Set on him with such violence, that yet"
258,CANTO VIII,For that render I thanks to God and praise
259,CANTO VIII,"""To Filippo Argenti:"" cried they all:"
260,CANTO VIII,And on himself the moody Florentine
261,CANTO VIII,"Turn'd his avenging fangs.  Him here we left,"
262,CANTO VIII,Nor speak I of him more.  But on mine ear
263,CANTO VIII,"Sudden a sound of lamentation smote,"
264,CANTO VIII,Whereat mine eye unbarr'd I sent abroad.
265,CANTO VIII,
266,CANTO VIII,"And thus the good instructor: ""Now, my son!"
267,CANTO VIII,"Draws near the city, that of Dis is nam'd,"
268,CANTO VIII,"With its grave denizens, a mighty throng."""
269,CANTO VIII,
270,CANTO VIII,"I thus: ""The minarets already, Sir!"
271,CANTO VIII,"There certes in the valley I descry,"
272,CANTO VIII,"Gleaming vermilion, as if they from fire"
273,CANTO VIII,"Had issu'd.""  He replied: ""Eternal fire,"
274,CANTO VIII,"That inward burns, shows them with ruddy flame"
275,CANTO VIII,"Illum'd; as in this nether hell thou seest."""
276,CANTO VIII,
277,CANTO VIII,"We came within the fosses deep, that moat"
278,CANTO VIII,This region comfortless.  The walls appear'd
279,CANTO VIII,As they were fram'd of iron.  We had made
280,CANTO VIII,"Wide circuit, ere a place we reach'd, where loud"
281,CANTO VIII,"The mariner cried vehement: ""Go forth!"
282,CANTO VIII,"The' entrance is here!""  Upon the gates I spied"
283,CANTO VIII,"More than a thousand, who of old from heaven"
284,CANTO VIII,"Were hurl'd.  With ireful gestures, ""Who is this,"""
285,CANTO VIII,"They cried, ""that without death first felt, goes through"
286,CANTO VIII,"The regions of the dead?""  My sapient guide"
287,CANTO VIII,Made sign that he for secret parley wish'd;
288,CANTO VIII,"Whereat their angry scorn abating, thus"
289,CANTO VIII,"They spake: ""Come thou alone; and let him go"
290,CANTO VIII,Who hath so hardily enter'd this realm.
291,CANTO VIII,Alone return he by his witless way;
292,CANTO VIII,"If well he know it, let him prove.  For thee,"
293,CANTO VIII,"Here shalt thou tarry, who through clime so dark"
294,CANTO VIII,"Hast been his escort."" Now bethink thee, reader!"
295,CANTO VIII,What cheer was mine at sound of those curs'd words.
296,CANTO VIII,I did believe I never should return.
297,CANTO VIII,
298,CANTO VIII,"""O my lov'd guide! who more than seven times"
299,CANTO VIII,"Security hast render'd me, and drawn"
300,CANTO VIII,"From peril deep, whereto I stood expos'd,"
301,CANTO VIII,"Desert me not,"" I cried, ""in this extreme."
302,CANTO VIII,"And if our onward going be denied,"
303,CANTO VIII,"Together trace we back our steps with speed."""
304,CANTO VIII,
305,CANTO VIII,"My liege, who thither had conducted me,"
306,CANTO VIII,"Replied: ""Fear not: for of our passage none"
307,CANTO VIII,"Hath power to disappoint us, by such high"
308,CANTO VIII,Authority permitted.  But do thou
309,CANTO VIII,Expect me here; meanwhile thy wearied spirit
310,CANTO VIII,"Comfort, and feed with kindly hope, assur'd"
311,CANTO VIII,"I will not leave thee in this lower world."""
312,CANTO VIII,
313,CANTO VIII,"This said, departs the sire benevolent,"
314,CANTO VIII,And quits me.  Hesitating I remain
315,CANTO VIII,At war 'twixt will and will not in my thoughts.
316,CANTO VIII,
317,CANTO VIII,"I could not hear what terms he offer'd them,"
318,CANTO VIII,"But they conferr'd not long, for all at once"
319,CANTO VIII,To trial fled within.  Clos'd were the gates
320,CANTO VIII,By those our adversaries on the breast
321,CANTO VIII,Of my liege lord: excluded he return'd
322,CANTO VIII,To me with tardy steps.  Upon the ground
323,CANTO VIII,"His eyes were bent, and from his brow eras'd"
324,CANTO VIII,"All confidence, while thus with sighs he spake:"
325,CANTO VIII,"""Who hath denied me these abodes of woe?"""
326,CANTO VIII,"Then thus to me: ""That I am anger'd, think"
327,CANTO VIII,No ground of terror: in this trial I
328,CANTO VIII,"Shall vanquish, use what arts they may within"
329,CANTO VIII,"For hindrance.  This their insolence, not new,"
330,CANTO VIII,"Erewhile at gate less secret they display'd,"
331,CANTO VIII,Which still is without bolt; upon its arch
332,CANTO VIII,Thou saw'st the deadly scroll: and even now
333,CANTO VIII,"On this side of its entrance, down the steep,"
334,CANTO VIII,"Passing the circles, unescorted, comes"
335,CANTO VIII,"One whose strong might can open us this land."""
