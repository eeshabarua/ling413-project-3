88,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,
89,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,
90,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"In undertaking, at the publishers' request, the function of editor of"
91,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"Mickle's Lusiad, I have compared the translation with the original, and,"
92,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"in some places, where another translation seemed preferable to, or more"
93,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"literal than, Mickle's, I have, in addition, given that rendering in a"
94,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"foot-note. Moreover, I have supplied the arguments to the several"
95,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"cantos, given a few more explanatory notes, and added a table of"
96,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,contents.
97,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,
98,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"""The late ingenious translator of the Lusiad,"" says Lord Strangford,[1]"
99,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"""has portrayed the character, and narrated the misfortunes of our poet,"
100,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,in a manner more honourable to his feelings as a man than to his
101,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,accuracy in point of biographical detail. It is with diffidence that the
102,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"present writer essays to correct his errors; but, as the real"
103,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,circumstances of the life of Camoëns are mostly to be found in his own
104,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"minor compositions, with which Mr. Mickle was unacquainted, he trusts"
105,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"that certain information will atone for his presumption."""
106,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,
107,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,As Lord Strangford professes to have better and more recent sources of
108,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"information regarding the illustrious, but unfortunate, bard of"
109,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"Portugal, I make no apology for presenting to the reader an abstract of"
110,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"his lordship's memoir. Much further information will be found, however,"
111,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,in an able article contained in No. 53 of the _Quarterly Review_ for
112,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"July, 1822, from the pen, I believe, of the poet Southey. ""The family of"
113,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"Camoëns was illustrious,"" says Lord Strangford, ""and originally Spanish."
114,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"They were long settled at Cadmon, a castle in Galicia, from which they"
115,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"probably derived their patronymic appellation. However, there are some"
116,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"who maintain that their name alluded to a certain wonderful bird,[2]"
117,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,whose mischievous sagacity discovered and punished the smallest
118,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"deviation from conjugal fidelity. A lady of the house of Cadmon, whose"
119,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"conduct had been rather indiscreet, demanded to be tried by this"
120,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"extraordinary judge. Her innocence was proved, and, in gratitude to the"
121,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"being who had restored him to matrimonial felicity, the contented"
122,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"husband adopted his name."" It would appear that in a dispute between the"
123,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"families of Cadmon and De Castera, a cavalier of the latter family was"
124,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,slain. This happened in the fourteenth century. A long train of
125,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"persecution followed, to escape which, Ruy de Camoëns, having embraced"
126,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"the cause of Ferdinand, removed with his family into Portugal, about"
127,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"A.D. 1370. His son, Vasco de Camoëns, was highly distinguished by royal"
128,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"favour, and had the honour of being the ancestor of our poet, who"
129,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"descended from him in the fourth generation. Luia de Camoëns, the author"
130,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"of the Lusiad, was born at Lisbon about A.D. 1524. His misfortunes began"
131,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,with his birth--he never saw a father's smile--for Simon Vasco de
132,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,Camoëns perished by shipwreck in the very year which gave being to his
133,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,illustrious son. The future poet was sent to the university of
134,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"Coimbra--then at the height of its fame,--""and maintained there by the"
135,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"provident care of his surviving parent."""
136,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,
137,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"""Love,"" says Lord Strangford, ""is very nearly allied to devotion, and it"
138,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"was in the exercise of the latter, that Camoëns was introduced to the"
139,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"knowledge of the former. In the Church of Christ's Wounds at Lisbon, on"
140,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"11th April, 1542, Camoëns first beheld Doña Caterina de Atayde, the"
141,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,object of his purest and earliest attachment ... and it was not long
142,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"before Camoëns enjoyed an opportunity of declaring his affection, with"
143,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"all the romantic ardour of eighteen and of a poet."" The peculiar"
144,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"situation of the lady, as one of the maids of honour to the queen,"
145,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,imposed a restraint upon her admirer which soon became intolerable; and
146,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"he, for having violated the sanctity of the royal precincts, was in"
147,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,consequence banished from the court. Whatever may have been the nature
148,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"of his offence, ""it furnished a pretext to the young lady's relations"
149,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,for terminating an intercourse which worldly considerations rendered
150,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"highly imprudent."""
151,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,
152,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"But Love consoled his votary: his mistress, on the morning of his"
153,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"departure, confessed the secret of her long-concealed affection, and the"
154,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,sighs of grief were soon lost in those of mutual delight. The hour of
155,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"parting was, perhaps, the sweetest of our poet's existence."
156,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,
157,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"Camoëns removed to Santarem, but speedily returned to Lisbon, was a"
158,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"second time detected, and again driven into exile.[3]"
159,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,
160,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"The voice of Love inspired our poet ""with the glorious resolution of"
161,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,conquering the obstacles which fortune had placed between him and
162,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"felicity."" He obtained permission, therefore, to accompany King John"
163,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,III. in an expedition then fitting out against the Moors in Africa. In
164,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,one of the engagements with the enemy our hero had the misfortune to
165,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"lose ""his right eye, by some splinters from the deck of the vessel in"
166,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,which he was stationed. Many of his most pathetic compositions were
167,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"written during this campaign, and the toils of a martial life were"
168,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,sweetened by the recollection of her for whose sake they were endured.
169,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"His heroic conduct at length procured his recall to court,"" but to find,"
170,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"alas, that his mistress was no more."
171,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,
172,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,Disappointed in his hope of obtaining any recognition of his valiant
173,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"deeds, he now resolved, under the burning sun of India, to seek that"
174,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"independence which his own country denied. ""The last words I uttered,"""
175,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"says Camoëns, ""on board the vessel before leaving, were those of Scipio:"
176,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"'Ungrateful country! thou shalt not even possess my bones.'"" ""Some,"""
177,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"says Lord Strangford, ""attribute his departure to a very different"
178,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"cause, and assert that he quitted his native shores on account of an"
179,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,intrigue in which he was detected with the beautiful wife of a
180,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"Portuguese gentleman. Perhaps,"" says Lord Strangford, ""this story may"
181,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"not be wholly unfounded."" On his arrival in India he contributed by his"
182,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,bravery to the success of an expedition carried on by the King of
183,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"Cochin, and his allies, the Portuguese, against the Pimento Islands; and"
184,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,in the following year (1555) he accompanied Manuel de Vasconcelos in an
185,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,expedition to the Red Sea. Here he explored the wild regions of East
186,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"Africa, and stored his mind with ideas of scenery, which afterwards"
187,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,formed some of the most finished pictures of the Lusiad.
188,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,
189,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"On his return to Goa, Camoëns devoted his whole attention to the"
190,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"completion of his poem; but an unfortunate satire which, under the title"
191,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"of _Disparates na India_, or Follies in India, he wrote against the"
192,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"vices and corruptions of the Portuguese authorities in Goa, so roused"
193,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,the indignation of the viceroy that the poet was banished to China.
194,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,
195,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"Of his adventures in China, and the temporary prosperity he enjoyed"
196,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"there, while he held the somewhat uncongenial office of _Provedor dos"
197,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"defuntos_, i.e., Trustee for deceased persons, Mickle has given an ample"
198,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,account in the introduction to the Lusiad. During those years Camoëns
199,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"completed his poem, about half of which was written before he left"
200,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"Europe. According to a tradition, not improbable in itself, he composed"
201,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,great part of it in a natural grotto which commands a splendid view of
202,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,the city and harbour of Macao. An engraving of it may be seen in
203,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"Onseley's Oriental Collections, and another will be found in Sir G."
204,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,Staunton's Account of the Embassy to China.
205,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,
206,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"A little temple, in the Chinese style, has been erected upon the rock,"
207,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"and the ground around it has been ornamented by Mr. Fitzhugh, one of our"
208,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"countrymen, from respect to the memory of the poet. The years that he"
209,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,passed in Macao were probably the happiest of his life. Of his departure
210,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"for Europe, and his unfortunate shipwreck at the mouth of the river"
211,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"Meekhaun,[4] in Cochin China, Mickle has also given a sufficient"
212,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,account.
213,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,
214,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"Lord Strangford has related, on the authority of Sousa, that while our"
215,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"poet was languishing in poverty at Lisbon, ""a cavalier, named Ruy de"
216,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"Camera, called on him one day, asking him to finish for him a poetical"
217,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,version of the seven penitential psalms. Raising his head from his
218,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"wretched pallet, and pointing to his faithful Javanese attendant, he"
219,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"exclaimed, 'Alas, when I was a poet, I was young, and happy, and blest"
220,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"with the love of ladies; but now I am a forlorn, deserted wretch."
221,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"See--there stands my poor Antonio, vainly supplicating fourpence to"
222,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"purchase a little coals--I have them not to give him.' The cavalier, as"
223,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"Sousa relates, closed both his heart and his purse, and quitted the"
224,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"room. Such were the grandees of Portugal."" Camoëns sank under the"
225,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"pressure of penury and disease, and died in an alms-house, early in"
226,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,"1579, and was buried in the church of Sta. Anna of the Franciscan"
227,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,Friars. Over his grave Gonzalo Coutinho placed the following
228,EDITOR'S PREFACE.,inscription:--

242,"MDLXXIX.""","not to be wondered at, however, that with his dislike to business in"
243,"MDLXXIX.""","general and to this one in particular, he did not succeed; and it is"

307,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,When the glory of the arms of Portugal had reached its meridian
308,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"splendour, Nature, as if in pity of the literary rudeness of that"
309,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"nation, produced a great poet to record the numberless actions of high"
310,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"spirit performed by his countrymen. Except Osorius, the historians of"
311,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,Portugal are little better than dry journalists. But it is not their
312,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,inelegance which rendered the poet necessary. It is the peculiar nature
313,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"of poetry to give a colouring to heroic actions, and to express"
314,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"indignation against breaches of honour, in a spirit which at once seizes"
315,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"the heart of the man of feeling, and carries with it instantaneous"
316,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,conviction. The brilliant actions of the Portuguese form the great hinge
317,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,which opened the door to the most important alterations in the civil
318,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,history of mankind. And to place these actions in the light and
319,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,enthusiasm of poetry--that enthusiasm which particularly assimilates the
320,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,youthful breast to its own fires--was Luis de Camoëns the poet of
321,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"Portugal, born."
322,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,
323,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,Different cities have claimed the honour of his birth. But according to
324,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"N. Antonio, and Manuel Correa, his intimate friend, this event happened"
325,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"at Lisbon in 1517.[6] His family was of considerable note, and"
326,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"originally Spanish. In 1370 Vasco Perez de Caamans, disgusted at the"
327,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"court of Castile, fled to that of Lisbon, where King Ferdinand"
328,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"immediately admitted him into his council, and gave him the lordships of"
329,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"Sardoal, Punnete, Marano, Amendo, and other considerable lands; a"
330,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,certain proof of the eminence of his rank and abilities. In the war for
331,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"the succession, which broke out on the death of Ferdinand, Caamans"
332,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"sided with the King of Castile, and was killed in the battle of"
333,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"Aljabarota. But though John I., the victor, seized a great part of his"
334,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"estate, his widow, the daughter of Gonsalo Tereyro, grand master of the"
335,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"Order of Christ, and general of the Portuguese army, was not reduced"
336,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"beneath her rank. She had three sons, who took the name of Camoëns. The"
337,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"family of the eldest intermarried with the first nobility of Portugal,"
338,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"and even, according to Castera, with the blood royal. But the family of"
339,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"the second brother, whose fortune was slender, had the superior honour"
340,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,to produce the author of the Lusiad.

348,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"to that of a Scaliger, but directed by the taste of a Milton or a Pope."
349,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,
350,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,When he left the university he appeared at court. He was a polished
351,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"scholar and very handsome,[7] possessing a most engaging mien and"
352,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"address, with the finest complexion, which, added to the natural ardour"
353,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"and gay vivacity of his deposition, rendered him an accomplished"
354,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"gentleman. Courts are the scenes of intrigue, and intrigue was"
355,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,fashionable at Lisbon. But the particulars of the amours of Camoëns rest
356,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"unknown. This only appears: he had aspired above his rank, for he was"
357,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,banished from the court; and in several of his sonnets he ascribes this
358,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,misfortune to love.
359,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,
360,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,He now retired to his mother's friends at Santarem. Here he renewed his
361,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"studies, and began his poem on the discovery of India. John III. at this"
362,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"time prepared an armament against Africa. Camoëns, tired of his"
363,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"inactive, obscure life, went to Ceuta in this expedition, and greatly"
364,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,distinguished his valour in several _rencontres_. In a naval engagement
365,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"with the Moors in the Straits of Gibraltar, Camoëns, in the conflict of"
366,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"boarding, where he was among the foremost, lost his right eye. Yet"
367,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"neither the hurry of actual service, nor the dissipation of the camp,"
368,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,could stifle his genius. He continued his _Lusiadas_; and several of his
369,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"most beautiful sonnets were written in Africa, while, as he expresses"
370,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"it,"
371,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,
372,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"""One hand the pen, and ant the sword employ'd."""
373,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,
374,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"The fame of his valour had now reached the Court, and he obtained"
375,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,permission to return to Lisbon. But while he solicited an establishment
376,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"which he had merited in the ranks of battle, the malignity of evil"
377,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,tongues (as he calls it in one of his letters) was injuriously poured
378,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,upon him. Though the bloom of his early youth was effaced by several
379,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"years residence under the scorching sky of Africa, and though altered by"
380,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"the loss of an eye, his presence gave uneasiness to the gentlemen of"
381,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,some families of the first rank where he had formerly visited. Jealousy
382,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,is the characteristic of the Spanish and Portuguese; its resentment
383,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"knows no bounds, and Camoëns now found it prudent to banish himself from"
384,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"his native country. Accordingly, in 1553 he hailed for India, with a"
385,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"resolution never to return. As the ship left the Tagus he exclaimed, in"
386,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"the words of the sepulchral monument of Scipio Africanus, ""_Ingrata"
387,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"patria, non possidebis ossa mea!_"" (Ungrateful country, thou shalt not"
388,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,possess my bones!) But he knew not what evils in the East would awaken
389,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,the remembrance of his native fields.
390,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,
391,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"When Camoëns arrived in India, an expedition was ready to sail to"
392,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,revenge the King of Cochin on the King of Pimenta. Without any rest on
393,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"shore after his long voyage, he joined this armament, and, in the"
394,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"conquest of the Alagada Islands, displayed his usual bravery. But his"
395,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"modesty, perhaps, is his greatest praise. In a sonnet he mentions this"
396,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"expedition: ""We went to punish the King of Pimenta,"" says he, ""_e"
397,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"succedeones bem_"" (and we succeeded well). When it is considered that"
398,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"the poet bore no inconsiderable share in the victory, no ode can"
399,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"conclude more elegantly, more happily than this."
400,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,
401,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"In the year following, he attended Manuel de Vasconcello in an"
402,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"expedition to the Red Sea. Here, says Faria, as Camoëns had no use for"
403,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"his sword, he employed his pen. Nor was his activity confined to the"
404,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"fleet or camp. He visited Mount Felix, and the adjacent inhospitable"
405,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"regions of Africa, which he so strongly pictures in the Lusiad, and in"
406,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"one of his little pieces, where he laments the absence of his mistress."
407,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,
408,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"When he returned to Goa, he enjoyed a tranquility which enabled him to"
409,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,bestow his attention on his epic poem. But this serenity was
410,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"interrupted, perhaps by his own imprudence. He wrote some satires which"
411,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"gave offence, and by order of the viceroy, Francisco Barreto, he was"
412,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,banished to China.
413,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,
414,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,Men of poor abilities are more conscious of their embarrassment and
415,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"errors than is commonly believed. When men of this kind are in power,"
416,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,they affect great solemnity; and every expression of the most distant
417,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,tendency to lessen their dignity is held as the greatest of crimes.
418,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"Conscious, also, how severely the man of genius can hurt their interest,"
419,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"they bear an instinctive antipathy against him, are uneasy even in his"
420,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"company, and, on the slightest pretence, are happy to drive him from"
421,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,them. Camoëns was thus situated at Goa; and never was there a fairer
422,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"field for satire than the rulers of India at that time afforded. Yet,"
423,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"whatever esteem the prudence of Camoëns may lose in our idea, the"
424,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"nobleness of his disposition will doubly gain. And, so conscious was he"
425,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"of his real integrity and innocence, that in one of his sonnets he"
426,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,wishes no other revenge on Barreto than that the cruelty of his exile
427,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,should ever be remembered.[8]
428,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,
429,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"The accomplishments and manners of Camoëns soon found him friends,"
430,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,though under the disgrace of banishment. He was appointed Commissary of
431,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"the estates of deceased persons, in the island of Macao, a Portuguese"
432,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,settlement on the coast of China. Here he continued his Lusiad; and
433,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"here, also, after five years residence, he acquired a fortune, though"
434,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"small, yet equal to his wishes. Don Constantine de Braganza was now"
435,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"Viceroy of India; and Camoëns, desirous to return to Goa, resigned his"
436,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"charge. In a ship, freighted by himself, he set sail, but was"
437,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"shipwrecked in the gulf near the mouth of the river Meekhaun, in Cochin"
438,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"China. All he had acquired was lost in the waves: his poems, which he"
439,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"held in one hand, while he swam with the other, were all he found"
440,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,himself possessed of when he stood friendless on the unknown shore. But
441,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,the natives gave him a most humane reception; this he has immortalized
442,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,in the prophetic song in the tenth Lusiad;[9] and in the seventh he
443,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,tells us that here he lost the wealth which satisfied his wishes.

451,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"By miracle prolong'd."""
452,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,
453,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"On the banks of the Meekhaun, he wrote his beautiful paraphrase of the"
454,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"137th Psalm, where the Jews, in the finest strain of poetry, are"
455,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,represented as hanging their harps on the willows by the rivers of
456,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"Babylon, and weeping their exile from their native country. Here Camoëns"
457,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"continued some time, till an opportunity offered to carry him to Goa."
458,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"When he arrived at that city, Don Constantine de Braganza, the viceroy,"
459,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"whose characteristic was politeness, admitted him into intimate"
460,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"friendship, and Camoëns was happy till Count Redondo assumed the"
461,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,government. Those who had formerly procured the banishment of the
462,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,satirist were silent while Constantine was in power. But now they
463,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"exerted all their arts against him. Redondo, when he entered on office,"
464,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"pretended to be the friend of Camoëns; yet, with the most unfeeling"
465,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"indifference, he suffered the innocent man to be thrown into the common"
466,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"prison. After all the delay of bringing witnesses, Camoëns, in a public"
467,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"trial, fully refuted every accusation against his conduct while"
468,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"commissary at Macao, and his enemies were loaded with ignominy and"
469,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,reproach. But Camoëns had some creditors; and these detained him in
470,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"prison a considerable time, till the gentlemen of Goa began to be"
471,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,ashamed that a man of his singular merit should experience such
472,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,treatment among them. He was set at liberty; and again he assumed the
473,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"profession of arms, and received the allowance of a"
474,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"gentleman-volunteer, a character at that time common in Portuguese"
475,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"India. Soon after, Pedro Barreto (appointed governor of the fort of"
476,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"Sofála), by high promises, allured the poet to attend him thither. The"
477,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"governor of a distant fort, in a barbarous country, shares in some"
478,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"measure the fate of an exile. Yet, though the only motive of Barreto"
479,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"was, in this unpleasant situation, to retain the conversation of Camoëns"
480,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"at his table, it was his least care to render the life of his guest"
481,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"agreeable. Chagrined with his treatment, and a considerable time having"
482,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"elapsed in vain dependence upon Barreto, Camoëns resolved to return to"
483,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"his native country. A ship, on the homeward voyage, at this time touched"
484,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"at Sofála, and several gentlemen[10] who were on board were desirous"
485,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,that Camoëns should accompany them. But this the governor ungenerously
486,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"endeavoured to prevent, and charged him with a debt for board. Anthony"
487,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"de Cabral, however, and Hector de Sylveyra, paid the demand, and"
488,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"Camoëns, says Faria, and the honour of Barreto were sold together."
489,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,
490,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"After an absence of sixteen years, Camoëns, in 1569, returned to Lisbon,"
491,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"unhappy even in his arrival, for the pestilence then raged in that city,"
492,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"and prevented his publishing for three years. At last, in 1572, he"
493,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"printed his Lusiad, which, in the opening of the first book, in a most"
494,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"elegant turn of compliment, he addressed to his prince, King Sebastian,"
495,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"then in his eighteenth year. The king, says the French translator, was"
496,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"so pleased with his merit, that he gave the author a pension of 4000"
497,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"reals, on condition that he should reside at court. But this salary,"
498,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"says the same writer, was withdrawn by Cardinal Henry, who succeeded to"
499,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"the crown of Portugal, lost by Sebastian at the battle of Alcazar."
500,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,
501,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,But this story of the pension is very doubtful. Correa and other
502,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"contemporary authors do not mention it, though some late writers have"
503,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"given credit to it. If Camoëns, however, had a pension, it is highly"
504,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,probable that Henry deprived him of it. While Sebastian was devoted to
505,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"the chase, his grand-uncle, the cardinal, presided at the council board,"
506,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"and Camoëns, in his address to the king, which closes the Lusiad,"
507,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,advises him to exclude the clergy from State affairs. It was easy to see
508,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"that the cardinal was here intended. And Henry, besides, was one of"
509,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,those statesmen who can perceive no benefit resulting to the public
510,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,from elegant literature. But it ought also to be added in completion of
511,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"his character, that under the narrow views and weak hands of this Henry,"
512,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"the kingdom of Portugal fell into utter ruin; and on his death, which"
513,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"closed a short inglorious reign, the crown of Lisbon, after a faint"
514,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"struggle, was annexed to that of Spain. Such was the degeneracy of the"
515,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"Portuguese, a degeneracy lamented in vain by Camoëns, whose observation"
516,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,of it was imputed to him as a crime.
517,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,
518,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,Though the great[11] patron of theological literature--a species the
519,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"reverse of that of Camoëns--certain it is, that the author of the Lusiad"
520,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"was utterly neglected by Henry, under whose inglorious reign he died in"
521,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"all the misery of poverty. By some, it is said, he died in an"
522,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"almshouse. It appears, however, that he had not even the certainty of"
523,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"subsistence which these houses provide. He had a black servant, who had"
524,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"grown old with him, and who had long experienced his master's humanity."
525,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"This grateful dependant, a native of Java, who, according to some"
526,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"writers, saved his master's life in the unhappy shipwreck where he lost"
527,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"his effects, begged in the streets of Lisbon for the only man in"
528,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,Portugal on whom God had bestowed those talents which have a tendency to
529,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"erect the spirit of a downward age. To the eye of a careful observer,"
530,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"the fate of Camoëns throws great light on that of his country, and will"
531,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"appear strictly connected with it. The same ignorance, the same"
532,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"degenerate spirit, which suffered Camoëns to depend on his share of the"
533,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,alms begged in the streets by his old hoary servant--the same spirit
534,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"which caused this, sank the kingdom of Portugal into the most abject"
535,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,vassalage ever experienced by a conquered nation. While the grandees of
536,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"Portugal were blind to the ruin which impended over them, Camoëns beheld"
537,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,it with a pungency of grief which hastened his end. In one of his
538,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"letters he has these remarkable words, ""_Em fim accaberey à vida, e"
539,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"verràm todos que fuy afeiçoada a minho patria_,"" etc.--""I am ending the"
540,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"course of my life, the world will witness how I have loved my country. I"
541,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"have returned, not only to die in her bosom, but to die with her."" In"
542,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"another letter, written a little before his death, he thus, yet with"
543,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"dignity, complains, ""Who has seen on so small a theatre as my poor bed,"
544,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"such a representation of the disappointments of Fortune. And I, as if"
545,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"she could not herself subdue me, I have yielded and become of her party;"
546,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"for it were wild audacity to hope to surmount such accumulated evils."""
547,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,
548,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"In this unhappy situation, in 1579, in his sixty-second year, the year"
549,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"after the fatal defeat of Don Sebastian, died Luis de Camoëns, the"
550,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,greatest literary genius ever produced by Portugal; in martial courage
551,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,and spirit of honour nothing inferior to her greatest heroes. And in a
552,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,manner suitable to the poverty in which he died was he buried. Soon
553,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"after, however, many epitaphs honoured his memory; the greatness of his"
554,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"merit was universally confessed, and his Lusiad was translated into"
555,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"various languages.[12] Nor ought it to be omitted, that the man so"
556,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"miserably neglected by the weak king Henry, was earnestly enquired after"
557,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,by Philip of Spain when he assumed the crown of Lisbon. When Philip
558,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"heard that Camoëns was dead, both his words and his countenance"
559,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,expressed his disappointment and grief.
560,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,
561,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"From the whole tenor of his life, and from that spirit which glows"
562,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"throughout the Lusiad, it evidently appears that the courage and manners"
563,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,of Camoëns flowed from true greatness and dignity of soul. Though his
564,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"polished conversation was often courted by the great, he appears so"
565,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,distant from servility that his imprudence in this respect is by some
566,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,highly blamed. Yet the instances of it by no means deserve that severity
567,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,of censure with which some writers have condemned him. Unconscious of
568,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"the feelings of a Camoëns, they knew not that a carelessness in securing"
569,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"the smiles of fortune, and an open honesty of indignation, are almost"
570,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"inseparable from the enthusiasm of fine imagination. The truth is, the"
571,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,man possessed of true genius feels his greatest happiness in the
572,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"pursuits and excursions of the mind, and therefore makes an estimate of"
573,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,things very different from that of him whose unremitting attention is
574,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,devoted to his external interest. The profusion of Camoëns is also
575,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"censured. Had he dissipated the wealth he acquired at Macao, his"
576,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,profusion indeed had been criminal; but it does not appear that he ever
577,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,enjoyed any other opportunity of acquiring independence. But Camoëns was
578,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"unfortunate, and the unfortunate man is viewed--"
579,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,
580,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"""Through the dim shade his fate casts o'er him:"
581,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,A shade that spreads its evening darkness o'er
582,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"His brightest virtues, while it shows his foibles"
583,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"Crowding and obvious as the midnight stars,"
584,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"Which, in the sunshine of prosperity"
585,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"Never had been descried."""
586,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,
587,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"Yet, after the strictest discussion, when all the causes are weighed"
588,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"together, the misfortunes of Camoëns will appear the fault and disgrace"
589,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"of his age and country, and not of the man. His talents would have"
590,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"secured him an apartment in the palace of Augustus, but such talents are"
591,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"a curse to their possessor in an illiterate nation. In a beautiful,"
592,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"digressive exclamation at the end of the Lusiad, he affords us a"
593,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,striking view of the neglect which he experienced. Having mentioned how
594,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"the greatest heroes of antiquity revered and cherished the muse, he thus"
595,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,characterizes the nobility of his own age and country.
596,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,

606,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,imprudent on his first appearance at the court of John III.; if the
607,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"honesty of his indignation led him into great imprudence, as certainly"
608,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"it did, when at Goa he satirised the viceroy and the first persons in"
609,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"power; yet let it also be remembered, that ""The gifts of imagination"
610,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,bring the heaviest task upon the vigilance of reason; and to bear those
611,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"faculties with unerring rectitude, or invariable propriety, requires a"
612,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"degree of firmness and of cool attention, which doth not always attend"
613,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"the higher gifts of the mind. Yet, difficult as nature herself seems to"
614,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"have rendered the task of regularity to genius, it is the supreme"
615,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,consolation of dullness and of folly to point with Gothic triumph to
616,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,those excesses which are the overflowings of faculties they never
617,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,enjoyed. Perfectly unconscious that they are indebted to their stupidity
618,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"for the consistency of their conduct, they plume themselves on an"
619,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,imaginary virtue which has its origin in what is really their
620,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"disgrace.--Let such, if such dare approach the shrine of Camoëns,"
621,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,withdraw to a respectful distance; and should they behold the ruins of
622,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"genius, or the weakness of an exalted mind, let them be taught to lament"
623,BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.,"that nature has left the noblest of her works imperfect.""[13]"

633,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"When Voltaire was in England, previous to his publication of his"
634,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"Henriade, he published in English an essay on the epic poetry of the"
635,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"European nations. In this he both highly praised, and severely attacked,"
636,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"the Lusiad. In his French editions of this essay, he has made various"
637,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"alterations, at different times, in the article on Camoëns. It is not,"
638,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"however, improper to premise, that some most amazing falsities will be"
639,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,here detected; the gross misrepresentation of every objection refuted;
640,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"and demonstration brought, that when Voltaire wrote his English essay,"
641,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"his knowledge of the Lusiad was entirely borrowed from the bold, harsh,"
642,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,unpoetical version of Fanshaw.

648,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"who pay as much respect to his memory as the English to Milton."""
649,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,
650,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,Among other passages of the Lusiad which he criticises is that where
651,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"""Adamastor, the giant of the Cape of Storms, appears to them, walking in"
652,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"the depth of the sea; his head reaches to the clouds; the storms, the"
653,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"winds, the thunders, and the lightnings hang about him; his arms are"
654,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"extended over the waves. It is the guardian of that foreign ocean,"
655,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,unploughed before by any ship. He complains of being obliged to submit
656,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"to fate, and to the audacious undertaking of the Portuguese, and"
657,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,foretells them all the misfortunes they must undergo in the Indies. I
658,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,believe that such a fiction would be thought noble and proper in all
659,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"ages, and in all nations."
660,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,
661,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"""There is another, which perhaps would have pleased the Italians as well"
662,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"as the Portuguese, but no other nation besides: it is the enchanted"
663,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"island, called the Island of Bliss, which the fleet finds in its way"
664,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"home, just rising from the sea, for their comfort, and for their reward."
665,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"Camoëns describes that place, as Tasso some years after depicted his"
666,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"island of Armida. There a supernatural power brings in all the beauties,"
667,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"and presents all the pleasures which nature can afford, and the heart"
668,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"may wish for; a goddess, enamoured with Vasco de Gama, carries him to"
669,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"the top of a high mountain, from whence she shows him all the kingdoms"
670,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"of the earth, and foretells the fate of Portugal."
671,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,
672,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"""After Camoëns hath given loose to his fancy, in the description of the"
673,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"pleasures which Gama and his crew enjoyed in the island, he takes care"
674,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,to inform the reader that he ought to understand by this fiction nothing
675,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"but the satisfaction which the virtuous man feels, and the glory which"
676,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"accrues to him, by the practice of virtue; but the best excuse for such"
677,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,an invention is the charming style in which it is delivered (if we may
678,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"believe the Portuguese), for the beauty of the elocution sometimes makes"
679,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"amends for the faults of the poet, as the colouring of Rubens makes some"
680,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,defects in his figures pass unregarded.
681,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,
682,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"""There is _another_ kind of machinery continued throughout all the poem,"
683,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"which nothing can excuse; that is, an injudicious mixture of the heathen"
684,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"gods with our religion. Gama in a storm addresses his prayers to Christ,"
685,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"but it is Venus who comes to his relief; the heroes are Christians, and"
686,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,the poet heathen. The main design which the Portuguese are supposed to
687,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,have (next to promoting their trade) is to propagate Christianity; yet
688,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"Jupiter, Bacchus, and Venus, have in their hands all the management of"
689,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,the voyage. So incongruous a machinery casts a blemish upon the whole
690,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,poem; yet it shows at the same time how prevailing are its beauties
691,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"since the Portuguese like it with all its faults."""
692,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,
693,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"The Lusiad, says Voltaire, contains ""a sort of epic poetry unheard of"

696,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"of these, in place of supporting the objection intended by Voltaire,"
697,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,points out the happy judgment and peculiar excellence of Camoëns. If
698,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"Homer has given us all the fire and hurry of battles, he has also given"
699,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"us all the uninteresting, tiresome detail. What reader but must be"
700,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"tired with the deaths of a thousand heroes, who are never mentioned"
701,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"before, nor afterwards, in the poem. Yet, in every battle we are wearied"

728,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"the idea of the battle be raised by such enumeration, still the copy and"
729,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,original are so near each other that they can never please in two
730,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,separate poems. Nor are the greater part of the battles of the Æneid
731,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,much more distant than those of the Iliad. Though Virgil with great art
732,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"has introduced a Camilla, a Pallas, and a Lausus, still, in many"
733,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"particulars, and in the action upon the whole, there is such a sameness"
734,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"with the Iliad, that the learned reader of the Æneid is deprived of the"
735,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"pleasure inspired by originality. If the man of taste, however, will be"
736,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,pleased to mark how the genius of a Virgil has managed a war after
737,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"Homer, he will certainly be tired with a dozen epic poems in the same"
738,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"style. Where the siege of a town and battles are the subject of an epic,"
739,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"there will, of necessity, in the characters and circumstances, be a"
740,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,resemblance to Homer; and such poem must therefore want originality.
741,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"Happily for Tasso, the variation of manners, and his masterly"
742,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"superiority over Homer in describing his duels, has given to his"
743,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"Jerusalem an air of novelty. Yet, with all the difference between"
744,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"Christian and pagan heroes, we have a Priam, an Agamemnon, an Achilles,"
745,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"etc., armies slaughtered, and a city besieged. In a word, we have a"
746,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,handsome copy of the Iliad in the Jerusalem Delivered. If some
747,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"imitations, however, have been successful, how many other epics of"
748,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,ancient and modern times have hurried down the stream of oblivion! Some
749,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"of their authors had poetical merit, but the fault was in the choice of"
750,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"their subjects. So fully is the strife of war exhausted by Homer, that"
751,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"Virgil and Tasso could add to it but little novelty; no wonder,"
752,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"therefore, that so many epics on battles and sieges have been suffered"
753,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"to sink into utter neglect. Camoëns, perhaps, did not weigh these"
754,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"circumstances, but the strength of his poetical genius directed him. He"
755,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,could not but feel what it was to read Virgil after Homer; and the
756,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,original turn and force of his mind led him from the beaten track of
757,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"Helen's and Lavinia's, Achilles's and Hector's sieges and slaughters,"
758,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"where the hero hews down, and drives to flight, whole armies with his"
759,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"own sword. Camoëns was the first who wooed the modern Epic Muse, and she"
760,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,gave him the wreath of a first lover; a sort of epic poetry unheard of
761,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"before; or, as Voltaire calls it, _une nouvelle espèce d'epopée_; and"
762,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,the grandest subject it is (of profane history) which the world has ever
763,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,beheld.[14] A voyage esteemed too great for man to dare; the adventures
764,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,of this voyage through unknown oceans deemed unnavigable; the eastern
765,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"world happily discovered, and for ever indissolubly joined and given to"
766,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,the western; the grand Portuguese empire in the East founded; the
767,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"humanization of mankind, and universal commerce the consequence! What"
768,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"are the adventures of an old, fabulous hero's arrival in Britain, what"
769,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,are Greece and Latium in arms for a woman compared to this! Troy is in
770,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"ashes, and even the Roman empire is no more. But the effects of the"
771,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"voyage, adventures, and bravery of the hero of the Lusiad will be felt"
772,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"and beheld, and perhaps increase in importance, while the world shall"
773,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,remain.
774,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,
775,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"Happy in his choice, happy also was the genius of Camoëns in the method"
776,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"of pursuing his subject. He has not, like Tasso, given it a total"
777,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"appearance of fiction; nor has he, like Lucan, excluded allegory and"
778,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,poetical machinery. Whether he intended it or not (for his genius was
779,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"sufficient to suggest its propriety), the judicious precept of"
780,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,Petronius[15] is the model of the Lusiad. That elegant writer proposes a
781,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"poem on the civil war, and no poem, ancient or modern, merits the"
782,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,character there sketched out in any degree comparative to the Lusiad. A
783,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"truth of history is preserved; yet, what is improper for the historian,"
784,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"the ministry of Heaven is employed, and the free spirit of poetry throws"
785,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,itself into fictions which makes the whole appear as an effusion of
786,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"prophetic fury, and not like a rigid detail of facts, given under the"
787,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"sanction of witnesses. Contrary to Lucan, who, in the above rules, drawn"
788,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"from the nature of poetry, is severely condemned by Petronius, Camoëns"
789,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"conducts his poem _per ambages Deorumque ministeria_. The apparition,"
790,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"which in the night hovers athwart the fleet near the Cape of Good Hope,"
791,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,is the grandest fiction in human composition; the invention his own! In
792,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"the Island of Venus, the use of which fiction in an epic poem is also"
793,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"his own, he has given the completest assemblage of all the flowers which"
794,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"have ever adorned the bowers of love. And, never was the _furentis animi"
795,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"vaticinatio_ more conspicuously displayed than in the prophetic song,"
796,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"the view of the spheres, and the globe of the earth. Tasso's imitation"
797,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"of the Island of Venus is not equal to the original; and, though"
798,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"""Virgil's myrtles[16] dropping blood are nothing to Tasso's enchanted"
799,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"forest,"" what are all Ismeno's enchantments to the grandeur and horror"
800,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"of the appearance, prophecy, and vanishment of the spectre of"
801,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"Camoëns![17] It has long been agreed among critics, that the solemnity"
802,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,of religious observances gives great dignity to the historical narrative
803,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"of epic poetry. Camoëns, in the embarkation of the fleet, and in several"
804,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"other places, is peculiarly happy in the dignity of religious"
805,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,allusions. Manners and character are also required in the epic poem. But
806,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"all the epics which have appeared are, except two, mere copies of the"
807,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"Iliad in these respects. Every one has its Agamemnon, Achilles, Ajax,"
808,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"and Ulysses; its calm, furious, gross, and intelligent hero. Camoëns and"
809,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"Milton happily left this beaten track, this exhausted field, and have"
810,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"given us pictures of manners unknown in the Iliad, the Æneid, and all"
811,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,those poems which may be classed with the Thebaid. The Lusiad abounds
812,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"with pictures of manners, from those of the highest chivalry to those of"
813,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"the rudest, fiercest, and most innocent barbarism. In the fifth, sixth,"
814,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"and ninth books, Leonardo and Veloso are painted in stronger colours"
815,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"than any of the inferior characters in Virgil. But _character_, indeed,"
816,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"is not the excellence of the Æneid. That of Monzaida, the friend of"
817,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"Gama, is much superior to that of Achates. The base, selfish, perfidious"
818,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"and cruel character of the Zamorim and the Moors, are painted in the"
819,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,strongest colours; and the character of Gama himself is that of the
820,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"finished hero. His cool command of his passions, his deep sagacity, his"
821,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"fixed intrepidity, his tenderness of heart, his manly piety, and his"
822,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,high enthusiasm in the love of his country are all displayed in the
823,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,superlative degree. Let him who objects the want of character to the
824,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"Lusiad, beware lest he stumble upon its praise; lest he only say, it"
825,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"wants an Achilles, a Hector, and a Priam. And, to the novelty of the"
826,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,manners of the Lusiad let the novelty of fire-arms also be added. It has
827,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"been said that the buckler, the bow, and the spear, must continue the"
828,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"arms of poetry. Yet, however unsuccessful others may have been, Camoëns"
829,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"has proved that fire-arms may be introduced with the greatest dignity,"
830,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,and the finest effect in the epic poem.
831,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,
832,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,As the grand interest of commerce and of mankind forms the subject of
833,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"the Lusiad, so, with great propriety, as necessary accompaniments to the"
834,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"voyage of his hero, the author has given poetical pictures of the four"
835,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"parts of the world--in the third book a view of Europe; in the fifth, a"
836,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"view of Africa; and in the tenth, a picture of Asia and America. Homer"
837,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,and Virgil have been highly praised for their judgment in the choice of
838,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"subjects which interested their countrymen, and Statius has been as"
839,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"severely condemned for his uninteresting choice. But, though the subject"
840,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"of Camoëns be particularly interesting to his own countrymen, it has"
841,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,also the peculiar happiness to be the poem of every trading nation. It
842,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"is the epic poem of the birth of commerce, and, in a particular manner,"
843,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,the epic poem of whatever country has the control and possession of the
844,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,commerce of India.[18]
845,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,
846,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"An unexhausted fertility and variety of poetical description, an"
847,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"unexhausted elevation of sentiment, and a constant tenor of the grand"
848,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"simplicity of diction, complete the character of the Lusiad of Camoëns:"
849,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"a poem which, though it has hitherto received from the public most"
850,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"unmerited neglect, and from the critics most flagrant injustice, was yet"
851,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,better understood by the greatest poet of Italy. Tasso never did his
852,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,judgment more credit than when he confessed that he dreaded Camoëns as a
853,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,rival; or his generosity more honour than when he addressed the elegant
854,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"sonnet to the hero of the Lusiad, commencing--"
855,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,

857,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"In contro al sol, che ne riporta il giorno."""
858,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,
859,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,It only remains to give some account of the version of the Lusiad which
860,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,is now offered to the public. Beside the translations mentioned in the
861,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"life of Camoëns, M. Duperron De Castera, in 1735, gave, in French prose,"
862,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,a loose unpoetical paraphrase[19] of the Lusiad. Nor does Sir Richard
863,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"Fanshaw's English version, published during the usurpation of Cromwell,"
864,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"merit a better character. Though stanza be rendered for stanza, though"
865,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"at first view it has the appearance of being exceedingly literal, this"
866,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,version is nevertheless exceedingly unfaithful. Uncountenanced by his
867,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"original, Fanshaw--"
868,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,
869,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"""Teems with many a dead-born just.""[20]"
870,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,
871,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"Nor had he the least idea of the dignity of the epic style,[21] or of"
872,BY THE TRANSLATOR.,"the true spirit of poetical translation. For this, indeed, no definite"

944,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"different degrees of civilization are candidly weighed, we may"
945,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,reasonably expect a just decision. As evidently as the appointment of
946,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"nature gives pasture to the herds, so evidently is man born for society."
947,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,As every other animal is in its natural state when in the situation
948,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"which its instinct requires, so man, when his reason is cultivated, is"
949,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"then, and only then, in the state proper to his nature. The life of the"
950,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"naked savage, who feeds on acorns and sleeps like a beast in his den, is"
951,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"commonly called the natural state of man; but, if there be any propriety"
952,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"in this assertion, his rational faculties compose no part of his nature,"
953,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"and were given not to be used. If the savage, therefore, live in a state"
954,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"contrary to the appointment of nature, it must follow that he is not so"
955,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,happy as nature intended him to be. And a view of his true character
956,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"will confirm this conclusion. The reveries, the fairy dreams of a"
957,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"Rousseau, may figure the paradisaical life of a Hottentot, but it is"
958,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,only in such dreams that the superior happiness of the barbarian exists.
959,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"The savage, it is true, is reluctant to leave his manner of life; but,"
960,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"unless we allow that he is a proper judge of the modes of living, his"
961,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,attachment to his own by no means proves that he is happier than he
962,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,might otherwise have been. His attachment only exemplifies the amazing
963,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,power of habit in reconciling the human breast to the most uncomfortable
964,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,situations. If the intercourse of mankind in some instances be
965,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"introductive of vice, the want of it as certainly excludes the exertion"
966,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"of the noblest virtues; and, if the seeds of virtue are indeed in the"
967,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"heart, they often lie dormant, and even unknown to the savage possessor."
968,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,The most beautiful description of a tribe of savages (which we may be
969,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,assured is from real life) occurs in these words:[23] And the five spies
970,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"of Dan ""came to Laish, and saw the people that were there, how they"
971,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and"
972,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in"
973,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"anything...."" And the spies said to their brethren, ""Arise, that we may"
974,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"go up against them; for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very"
975,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"good.... And they came unto Laish, unto a people that were at quiet and"
976,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the"
977,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"city with fire. And there was no deliverer, because it was far from"
978,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"Zidon, and they had no business with any man."" However the happy"
979,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"simplicity of this society may please the man of fine imagination, the"
980,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,true philosopher will view the men of Laish with other eyes. However
981,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"virtuous he may suppose one generation, it requires an alteration of"
982,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,human nature to preserve the children of the next in the same generous
983,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,estrangement from the selfish passions--from those passions which are
984,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,the parents of the acts of injustice. When his wants are easily
985,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"supplied, the manners of the savage will be simple, and often humane,"
986,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,for the human heart is not vicious without objects of temptation. But
987,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,these will soon occur; he that gathers the greatest quantity of fruit
988,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,will be envied by the less industrious. The uninformed mind seems
989,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,insensible of the idea of the right of possession which the labour of
990,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"acquirement gives. When want is pressing, and the supply at hand, the"
991,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,only consideration with such minds is the danger of seizing it; and
992,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"where there is no magistrate to put to shame in anything, depredation"
993,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,will soon display all its horrors. Let it even be admitted that the
994,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,innocence of the men of Laish could secure them from the consequences of
995,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"their own unrestrained desires, could even this impossibility be"
996,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"surmounted, still are they a wretched prey to the first invaders, and"
997,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"because they have no business with any man, they will find no deliverer."
998,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"While human nature is the same, the fate of Laish will always be the"
999,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,fate of the weak and defenceless; and thus the most amiable description
1000,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,of savage life raises in our minds the strongest imagery of the misery
1001,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,and impossible continuance of such a state. But if the view of these
1002,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"innocent people terminate in horror, with what contemplation shall we"
1003,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"behold the wilds of Africa and America? The tribes of America, it is"
1004,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"true, have degrees of policy greatly superior to anything understood by"
1005,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"the men of Laish. Great masters of martial oratory, their popular"
1006,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,assemblies are schools open to all their youth. In these they not only
1007,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"learn the history of their nation, and what they have to fear from the"
1008,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"strength and designs of their enemies, but they also imbibe the most"
1009,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"ardent spirit of war. The arts of stratagem are their study, and the"
1010,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"most athletic exercises of the field their employment and delight; and,"
1011,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"what is their greatest praise, they have magistrates ""to put them to"
1012,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"shame."" They inflict no corporeal punishment on their countrymen, it is"
1013,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"true; but a reprimand from an elder, delivered in the assembly, is"
1014,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,esteemed by them a deeper degradation and severer punishment than any of
1015,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"those too often most impolitically adopted by civilized nations. Yet,"
1016,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,though possessed of this advantage--an advantage impossible to exist in
1017,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"a large commercial empire--and though masters of great martial policy,"
1018,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"their condition, upon the whole, is big with the most striking"
1019,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,demonstration of the misery and unnatural state of such very imperfect
1020,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"civilization. ""Multiply and replenish the earth"" is an injunction of the"
1021,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,best political philosophy ever given to man. Nature has appointed man to
1022,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"cultivate the earth, to increase in number by the food which its culture"
1023,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"gives, and by this increase of brethren to remove some, and to mitigate"
1024,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"all, the natural miseries of human life. But in direct opposition to"
1025,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,this is the political state of the wild aborigines of America. Their
1026,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"lands, luxuriant in climate, are often desolate wastes, where thousands"
1027,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,of miles hardly support a few hundreds of savage hunters. Attachment to
1028,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,their own tribe constitutes their highest idea of virtue; but this
1029,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"virtue includes the most brutal depravity, makes them esteem the man of"
1030,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"every other tribe as an enemy, as one with whom nature had placed them"
1031,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"in a state of war, and had commanded to destroy.[24] And to this"
1032,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,principle their customs and ideas of honour serve as rituals and
1033,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,ministers. The cruelties practised by the American savages on their
1034,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,prisoners of war (and war is their chief employment) convey every idea
1035,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"expressed by the word diabolical, and give a most shocking view of the"
1036,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,degradation of human nature. But what peculiarly completes the character
1037,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,of the savage is his horrible superstition. In the most distant nations
1038,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"the savage is, in this respect, the same. The terror of evil spirits"
1039,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"continually haunts him; his God is beheld as a relentless tyrant, and is"
1040,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"worshipped often with cruel rites, always with a heart full of horror"
1041,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"and fear. In all the numerous accounts of savage worship, one trace of"
1042,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,filial dependence is not to be found. The very reverse of that happy
1043,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,idea is the hell of the ignorant mind. Nor is this barbarism confined
1044,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,alone to those ignorant tribes whom we call savages. The vulgar of every
1045,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"country possess it in certain degrees, proportionated to their"
1046,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,opportunities of conversation with the more enlightened. Sordid
1047,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"disposition and base ferocity, together with the most unhappy"
1048,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"superstition, are everywhere the proportionate attendants of ignorance"
1049,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,and severe want. And ignorance and want are only removed by intercourse
1050,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"and the offices of society. So self-evident are these positions, that it"
1051,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,requires an apology for insisting upon them; but the apology is at hand.
1052,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"He who has read knows how many eminent writers,[25] and he who has"
1053,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"conversed knows how many respectable names, connect the idea of"
1054,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,innocence and happiness with the life of the savage and the unimproved
1055,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"rustic. To fix the character of the savage is therefore necessary, ere"
1056,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"we examine the assertion, that ""it had been happy for both the old and"
1057,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"the new worlds if the East and West Indies had never been discovered."""
1058,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,The bloodshed and the attendant miseries which the unparalleled rapine
1059,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"and cruelties of the Spaniards spread over the new world, indeed"
1060,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,disgrace human nature. The great and flourishing empires of Mexico and
1061,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"Peru, steeped in the blood of forty millions of their sons, present a"
1062,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"melancholy prospect, which must excite the indignation of every good"
1063,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,heart. Yet such desolation is not the certain consequence of discovery.
1064,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"And, even should we allow that the depravity of human nature is so great"
1065,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,that the avarice of the merchant and rapacity of the soldier will
1066,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"overwhelm with misery every new-discovered country, still, are there"
1067,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"other, more comprehensive views, to be taken, ere we decide against the"
1068,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,intercourse introduced by navigation. When we weigh the happiness of
1069,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"Europe in the scale of political philosophy, we are not to confine our"
1070,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"eye to the dreadful ravages of Attila the Hun, or of Alaric the Goth. If"
1071,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,the waters of a stagnated lake are disturbed by the spade when led into
1072,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"new channels, we ought not to inveigh against the alteration because the"
1073,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,waters are fouled at the first; we are to wait to see the streamlets
1074,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,refine and spread beauty and utility through a thousand vales which they
1075,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"never visited before. Such were the conquests of Alexander, temporary"
1076,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"evils, but civilization and happiness followed in the bloody track. And,"
1077,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"though disgraced with every barbarity, happiness has also followed the"
1078,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,conquests of the Spaniards in the other hemisphere. Though the villainy
1079,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"of the Jesuits defeated their schemes of civilization in many countries,"
1080,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,the labours of that society have been crowned with a success in Paraguay
1081,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"and in Canada, which reflects upon their industry the greatest honour."
1082,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,The customs and cruelties of many American tribes still disgrace human
1083,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"nature, but in Paraguay and Canada the natives have been brought to"
1084,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"relish the blessings of society, and the arts of virtuous and civil"
1085,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"life. If Mexico is not so populous as it once was, neither is it so"
1086,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,barbarous;[26] the shrieks of the human victim do not now resound from
1087,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"temple to temple, nor does the human heart, held up reeking to the sun,"
1088,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"imprecate the vengeance of Heaven on the guilty empire. And, however"
1089,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"impolitically despotic the Spanish governments may be, still do these"
1090,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"colonies enjoy the opportunities of improvement, which in every age"
1091,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,arise from the knowledge of commerce and of letters--opportunities which
1092,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,were never enjoyed in South America under the reigns of Montezuma and
1093,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"Atabalipa. But if from Spanish, we turn our eyes to British America,"
1094,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"what a glorious prospect! Here, formerly, on the wild lawn, perhaps"
1095,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"twice in the year, a few savage hunters kindled their evening fire,"
1096,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"kindled it more to protect them from evil spirits and beasts of prey,"
1097,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"than from the cold, and with their feet pointed to it, slept on the"
1098,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"ground. Here, now, population spreads her thousands, and society appears"
1099,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"in all its blessings of mutual help, and the mutual lights of"
1100,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"intellectual improvement. ""What work of art, or power, or public"
1101,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"utility, has ever equalled the glory of having peopled a continent,"
1102,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"without guilt or bloodshed, with a multitude of free and happy"
1103,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"commonwealths; to have given them the best arts of life and government!"""
1104,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,To have given a savage continent an image of the British Constitution
1105,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"is, indeed, the greatest glory of the British crown, ""a greater than any"
1106,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"other nation ever acquired;"" and from the consequences of the genius of"
1107,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"Henry, Duke of Viseo, did the British American empire arise, an empire"
1108,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"which, unless retarded by the illiberal and inhuman spirit of religious"
1109,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"fanaticism, will in a few centuries, perhaps, be the glory of the world."
1110,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,
1111,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"Stubborn indeed must be the theorist who will deny the improvement,"
1112,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"virtue, and happiness which, in the result, the voyage of Columbus has"
1113,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,spread over the western world. The happiness which Europe and Asia have
1114,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"received from the intercourse with each other, cannot hitherto, it must"
1115,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"be owned, be compared either with the possession of it, or the source of"
1116,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"its increase established in America. Yet, let the man of the most"
1117,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,melancholy views estimate all the wars and depredations which are
1118,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"charged upon the Portuguese and other European nations, still will the"
1119,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,eastern world appear considerably advantaged by the voyage of Gama. If
1120,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"seas of blood have been shed by the Portuguese, nothing new was"
1121,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,introduced into India. War and depredation were no unheard-of strangers
1122,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"on the banks of the Ganges, nor could the nature of the civil"
1123,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,establishments of the eastern nations secure a lasting peace. The
1124,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"ambition of their native princes was only diverted into new channels,"
1125,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"into channels which, in the natural course of human affairs, will"
1126,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"certainly lead to permanent governments, established on improved laws"
1127,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"and just dominion. Yet, even ere such governments are formed, is Asia no"
1128,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,loser by the arrival of Europeans. The horrid massacres and unbounded
1129,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"rapine which, according to their own annals, followed the victories of"
1130,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,their Asian conquerors were never equalled by the worst of their
1131,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,European vanquishers. Nor is the establishment of improved governments
1132,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,in the East the dream of theory. The superiority of the civil and
1133,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"military arts of the British, notwithstanding the hateful character of"
1134,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"some individuals, is at this day beheld in India with all the"
1135,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"astonishment of admiration; and admiration is always followed, though"
1136,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"often with retarded steps, by the strong desire of similar improvement."
1137,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,Long after the fall of the Roman empire the Roman laws were adopted by
1138,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"nations which ancient Rome esteemed as barbarous. And thus, in the"
1139,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"course of ages, the British laws, according to every test of"
1140,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"probability, will have a most important effect, will fulfil the prophecy"
1141,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"of Camoëns, and transfer to the British the high compliment he pays to"
1142,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,his countrymen--
1143,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,
1144,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"""Beneath their sway majestic, wise, and mild,"
1145,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"Proud of her victor's laws thrice happier India smiled."""
1146,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,
1147,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"In former ages, and within these few years, the fertile empire of India"
1148,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"has exhibited every scene of human misery, under the undistinguishing"
1149,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,ravages of their Mohammedan and native princes; ravages only equalled
1150,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"in European history by those committed under Atilla, surnamed ""the"
1151,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"scourge of God,"" and ""the destroyer of nations."" The ideas of patriotism"
1152,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,and of honour were seldom known in the cabinets of the eastern princes
1153,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,till the arrival of the Europeans. Every species of assassination was
1154,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"the policy of their courts, and every act of unrestrained rapine and"
1155,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,massacre followed the path of victory. But some of the Portuguese
1156,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"governors, and many of the English officers, have taught them that"
1157,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"humanity to the conquered is the best, the truest policy. The brutal"
1158,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,ferocity of their own conquerors is now the object of their greatest
1159,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,dread; and the superiority of the British in war has convinced their
1160,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"princes,[27] that an alliance with the British is the surest guarantee"
1161,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,of their national peace and prosperity. While the English East India
1162,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"Company are possessed of their present greatness, it is in their power"
1163,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,to diffuse over the East every blessing which flows from the wisest and
1164,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"most humane policy. Long ere the Europeans arrived, a failure of the"
1165,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"crop of rice, the principal food of India, had spread the devastations"
1166,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"of famine over the populous plains of Bengal. And never, from the seven"
1167,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"years' famine of ancient Egypt to the present day, was there a natural"
1168,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,scarcity in any country which did not enrich the proprietors of the
1169,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"granaries. The Mohammedan princes, and Moorish traders have often added"
1170,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"all the horrors of an artificial, to a natural, famine. But, however"
1171,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"some Portuguese or other governors may stand accused, much was left for"
1172,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"the humanity of the more exalted policy of an Albuquerque, or a Castro."
1173,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"And under such European governors as these, the distresses of the East"
1174,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"have often been alleviated by a generosity of conduct, and a train of"
1175,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,resources formerly unknown in Asia. Absurd and impracticable were that
1176,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,scheme which would introduce the British laws into India without the
1177,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,deepest regard to the manners and circumstances peculiar to the people.
1178,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"But that spirit of liberty upon which they are founded, and that"
1179,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"security of property which is their leading principle, must in time have"
1180,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,a wide and stupendous effect. The abject spirit of Asiatic submission
1181,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"will be taught to see, and to claim, those rights of nature, of which"
1182,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"the dispirited and passive Hindus could, till lately, hardly form an"
1183,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"idea. From this, as naturally as the noon succeeds the dawn, must the"
1184,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"other blessings of civilization arise. For, though the four great castes"
1185,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"of India are almost inaccessible to the introduction of other manners,"
1186,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"and of other literature than their own, happily there is in human nature"
1187,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,a propensity to change. Nor may the political philosopher be deemed an
1188,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"enthusiast who would boldly prophesy, that unless the British be driven"
1189,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"from India the general superiority which they bear will, ere many"
1190,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"generations shall have passed, induce the most intelligent of India to"
1191,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"break the shackles of their absurd superstitions,[28] and lead them to"
1192,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,partake of those advantages which arise from the free scope and due
1193,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,cultivation of the rational powers. In almost every instance the Indian
1194,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,institutions are contrary to the feelings and wishes of nature. And
1195,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"ignorance and bigotry, their two chief pillars, can never secure"
1196,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,unalterable duration. We have certain proof that the horrid custom of
1197,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,burning the wives along with the body of the deceased husband has
1198,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,continued for upwards of fifteen hundred years; we are also certain that
1199,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,within these twenty years it has begun to fall into disuse. Together
1200,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"with the alteration of this most striking feature of Indian manners,"
1201,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,other assimilations to European sentiments have already taken place. Nor
1202,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,can the obstinacy even of the conceited Chinese always resist the desire
1203,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"of imitating the Europeans, a people who in arts and arms are so greatly"
1204,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"superior to themselves. The use of the twenty-four letters, by which we"
1205,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"can express every language, appeared at first as miraculous to the"
1206,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"Chinese. Prejudice cannot always deprive that people, who are not"
1207,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"deficient in selfish cunning, of the ease and expedition of an alphabet;"
1208,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"and it is easy to foresee that, in the course of a few centuries, some"
1209,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"alphabet will certainly take the place of the 60,000 arbitrary marks"
1210,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,which now render the cultivation of the Chinese literature not only a
1211,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"labour of the utmost difficulty, but even the attainment impossible"
1212,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"beyond a very limited degree. And from the introduction of an alphabet,"
1213,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,what improvements may not be expected from the laborious industry of the
1214,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"Chinese! Though most obstinately attached to their old customs, yet"
1215,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"there is a tide in the manners of nations which is sudden and rapid, and"
1216,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,which acts with a kind of instinctive fury against ancient prejudice and
1217,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"absurdity. It was that nation of merchants, the Phoenicians, which"
1218,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"diffused the use of letters through the ancient, and commerce will"
1219,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"undoubtedly diffuse the same blessings through the modern, world."
1220,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,
1221,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,To this view of the political happiness which is sure to be introduced
1222,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"in proportion to civilization, let the divine add what may be reasonably"
1223,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,expected from such opportunity of the increase of religion. A factory of
1224,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"merchants, indeed, has seldom been found to be a school of piety; yet,"
1225,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,when the general manners of a people become assimilated to those of a
1226,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"more rational worship, something more than ever was produced by an"
1227,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"infant mission, or the neighbourhood of an infant colony, may then be"
1228,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"reasonably expected, and even foretold."
1229,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,
1230,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"In estimating the political happiness of a people, nothing is of greater"
1231,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"importance than their capacity of, and tendency to, improvement. As a"
1232,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"dead lake, to continue our former illustration, will remain in the same"
1233,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"state for ages and ages, so would the bigotry and superstitions of the"
1234,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,East continue the same. But if the lake is begun to be opened into a
1235,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"thousand rivulets, who knows over what unnumbered fields, barren before,"
1236,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,"they may diffuse the blessings of fertility, and turn a dreary"
1237,MICKLE'S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.,wilderness into a land of society and joy.

1253,LUSIAD X.,LUSIAD X.
1254,LUSIAD X.,
1255,LUSIAD X.,Let us consider how many millions of these unhappy savages are dragged
1256,LUSIAD X.,"from their native fields, and cut off for ever from all the hopes and"
1257,LUSIAD X.,all the rights to which human birth entitled them. And who would
1258,LUSIAD X.,"hesitate to pronounce that negro the greatest of patriots, who, by"
1259,LUSIAD X.,"teaching his countrymen the arts of society, should teach them to defend"
1260,LUSIAD X.,"themselves in the possession of their fields, their families, and their"
1261,LUSIAD X.,own personal liberties?
1262,LUSIAD X.,
1263,LUSIAD X.,"Evident, however, as it is, that the voyages of Gama and Columbus have"
1264,LUSIAD X.,"already carried a superior degree of happiness, and the promise of"
1265,LUSIAD X.,"infinitely more, to the eastern and western worlds; yet the advantages"
1266,LUSIAD X.,to Europe from the discovery of these regions may perhaps be denied. But
1267,LUSIAD X.,"let us view what Europe was, ere the genius of Don Henry gave birth to"
1268,LUSIAD X.,the spirit of modern discovery.
1269,LUSIAD X.,
1270,LUSIAD X.,Several ages before this period the feudal system had degenerated into
1271,LUSIAD X.,the most absolute tyranny. The barons exercised the most despotic
1272,LUSIAD X.,"authority over their vassals, and every scheme of public utility was"
1273,LUSIAD X.,rendered impracticable by their continual petty wars with each other; to
1274,LUSIAD X.,"which they led their dependents as dogs to the chase. Unable to read, or"
1275,LUSIAD X.,"to write his own name, the chieftain was entirely possessed by the most"
1276,LUSIAD X.,"romantic opinion of military glory, and the song of his domestic"
1277,LUSIAD X.,minstrel constituted his highest idea of fame. The classic authors slept
1278,LUSIAD X.,"on the shelves of the monasteries, their dark but happy asylum, while"
1279,LUSIAD X.,the life of the monks resembled that of the fattened beeves which loaded
1280,LUSIAD X.,their tables. Real abilities were indeed possessed by a Duns Scotus and
1281,LUSIAD X.,a few others; but these were lost in the most trifling subtleties of a
1282,LUSIAD X.,sophistry which they dignified with the name of casuistical divinity.
1283,LUSIAD X.,Whether Adam and Eve were created with navels? and How many thousand
1284,LUSIAD X.,angels might at the same instant dance upon the point of the finest
1285,LUSIAD X.,needle without one jostling another? were two of the several topics of
1286,LUSIAD X.,like importance which excited the acumen and engaged the controversies
1287,LUSIAD X.,"of the learned. While every branch of philosophical, of rational"
1288,LUSIAD X.,"investigation, was thus unpursued and unknown, commerce, which is"
1289,LUSIAD X.,"incompatible with the feudal system, was equally neglected and"
1290,LUSIAD X.,"unimproved. Where the mind is enlarged and enlightened by learning,"
1291,LUSIAD X.,"plans of commerce will rise into action, and these, in return, will from"
1292,LUSIAD X.,every part of the world bring new acquirements to philosophy and
1293,LUSIAD X.,"science. The birth of learning and commerce may be different, but their"
1294,LUSIAD X.,growth is mutual and dependent upon each other. They not only assist
1295,LUSIAD X.,"each other, but the same enlargement of mind which is necessary for"
1296,LUSIAD X.,perfection in the one is also necessary for perfection in the other; and
1297,LUSIAD X.,"the same causes impede, and are alike destructive of, both. The"
1298,LUSIAD X.,INTERCOURSE of mankind is the parent of each. According to the
1299,LUSIAD X.,"confinement or extent of intercourse, barbarity or civilization"
1300,LUSIAD X.,"proportionately prevail. In the dark, monkish ages, the intercourse of"
1301,LUSIAD X.,the learned was as much impeded and confined as that of the merchant. A
1302,LUSIAD X.,"few unwieldy vessels coasted the shores of Europe, and mendicant friars"
1303,LUSIAD X.,and ignorant pilgrims carried a miserable account of what was passing in
1304,LUSIAD X.,the world from monastery to monastery. What doctor had last disputed on
1305,LUSIAD X.,"the peripatetic philosophy at some university, or what new heresy had"
1306,LUSIAD X.,"last appeared, not only comprised the whole of their literary"
1307,LUSIAD X.,"intelligence, but was delivered with little accuracy, and received with"
1308,LUSIAD X.,as little attention. While this thick cloud of mental darkness
1309,LUSIAD X.,"overspread the western world, was Don Henry, prince of Portugal, born;"
1310,LUSIAD X.,"born to set mankind free from the feudal system, and to give to the"
1311,LUSIAD X.,"whole world every advantage, every light that may possibly be diffused"
1312,LUSIAD X.,by the intercourse of unlimited commerce:--

1324,THOMSON.,
1325,THOMSON.,"In contrast to this melancholy view of human nature, sunk in barbarism"
1326,THOMSON.,"and benighted with ignorance, let the present state of Europe be"
1327,THOMSON.,"impartially estimated. Yet, though the great increase of opulence and"
1328,THOMSON.,"learning cannot be denied, there are some who assert that virtue and"
1329,THOMSON.,"happiness have as greatly declined. And the immense overflow of riches,"
1330,THOMSON.,"from the East in particular, has been pronounced big with destruction to"
1331,THOMSON.,"the British empire. Everything human, it is true, has its dark as well"
1332,THOMSON.,"as its bright side; but let these popular complaints be examined, and it"
1333,THOMSON.,"will be found that modern Europe, and the British empire in a very"
1334,THOMSON.,"particular manner, have received the greatest and most solid advantages"
1335,THOMSON.,"from the modern, enlarged system of commerce. The magic of the old"
1336,THOMSON.,"romances, which could make the most withered, deformed hag, appear as"
1337,THOMSON.,"the most beautiful virgin, is every day verified in popular declamation."
1338,THOMSON.,"Ancient days are there painted in the most amiable simplicity, and the"
1339,THOMSON.,"modern in the most odious colours. Yet, what man of fortune in England"
1340,THOMSON.,lives in that stupendous gross luxury which every day was exhibited in
1341,THOMSON.,the Gothic castles of the old chieftains! Four or five hundred knights
1342,THOMSON.,"and squires in the domestic retinue of a warlike earl was not uncommon,"
1343,THOMSON.,nor was the pomp of embroidery inferior to the profuse waste of their
1344,THOMSON.,tables; in both instances unequalled by all the mad excesses of the
1345,THOMSON.,present age.
1346,THOMSON.,
1347,THOMSON.,"While the baron thus lived in all the wild glare of Gothic luxury,"
1348,THOMSON.,"agriculture was almost totally neglected, and his meaner vassals fared"
1349,THOMSON.,"harder, infinitely less comfortably, than the meanest industrious"
1350,THOMSON.,"labourers of England do now; where the lands are uncultivated, the"
1351,THOMSON.,"peasants, ill-clothed, ill-lodged, and poorly fed, pass their miserable"
1352,THOMSON.,"days in sloth and filth, totally ignorant of every advantage, of every"
1353,THOMSON.,comfort which nature lays at their feet. He who passes from the trading
1354,THOMSON.,towns and cultured fields of England to those remote villages of
1355,THOMSON.,"Scotland or Ireland which claim this description, is astonished at the"
1356,THOMSON.,comparative wretchedness of their destitute inhabitants; but few
1357,THOMSON.,consider that these villages only exhibit a view of what Europe was ere
1358,THOMSON.,the spirit of commerce diffused the blessings which naturally flow from
1359,THOMSON.,her improvements. In the Hebrides the failure of a harvest almost
1360,THOMSON.,"depopulates an island. Having little or no traffic to purchase grain,"
1361,THOMSON.,numbers of the young and hale betake themselves to the continent in
1362,THOMSON.,"quest of employment and food, leaving a few, less adventurous, behind,"
1363,THOMSON.,"to beget a new race, the heir of the same fortune. Yet from the same"
1364,THOMSON.,"cause, from the want of traffic, the kingdom of England has often felt"
1365,THOMSON.,more dreadful effects than these. Even in the days when her Henries and
1366,THOMSON.,"Edwards plumed themselves with the trophies of France, how often has"
1367,THOMSON.,famine spread all her horrors over city and village? Our modern
1368,THOMSON.,histories neglect this characteristic feature of ancient days; but the
1369,THOMSON.,"rude chronicles of these ages inform us, that three or four times in"
1370,THOMSON.,almost every reign was England thus visited. The failure of the crop was
1371,THOMSON.,"then severely felt, and two bad harvests in succession were almost"
1372,THOMSON.,"insupportable. But commerce has now opened another scene, has armed"
1373,THOMSON.,government with the happiest power that can be exerted by the rulers of
1374,THOMSON.,a nation--the power to prevent every extremity[29] which may possibly
1375,THOMSON.,"arise from bad harvests; extremities, which, in former ages, were"
1376,THOMSON.,esteemed more dreadful visitations of the wrath of Heaven than the
1377,THOMSON.,pestilence itself. Yet modern London is not so certainly defended
1378,THOMSON.,"against the latter, its ancient visitor, than the commonwealth by the"
1379,THOMSON.,"means of commerce, under a just and humane government, is secured"
1380,THOMSON.,"against the ravages of the former. If, from these great outlines of the"
1381,THOMSON.,"happiness enjoyed by a commercial over an uncommercial nation, we turn"
1382,THOMSON.,"our eyes to the manners, the advantages will be found no less in favour"
1383,THOMSON.,of the civilized.
1384,THOMSON.,
1385,THOMSON.,"Whoever is inclined to declaim at the vices of the present age, let him"
1386,THOMSON.,"read, and be convinced, that the Gothic ages were less virtuous. If the"
1387,THOMSON.,"spirit of chivalry prevented effeminacy, it was the foster-father of a"
1388,THOMSON.,"ferocity of manners now happily unknown. Rapacity, avarice, and"
1389,THOMSON.,effeminacy are the vices ascribed to the increase of commerce; and in
1390,THOMSON.,"some degree, it must be confessed, they follow her steps. Yet infinitely"
1391,THOMSON.,"more dreadful, as every palatinate in Europe often felt, were the"
1392,THOMSON.,effects of the two first under the feudal lords than can possibly be
1393,THOMSON.,experienced under any system of trade. The virtues and vices of human
1394,THOMSON.,nature are the same in every age: they only receive different
1395,THOMSON.,"modifications, and are dormant, or awakened into action, under different"
1396,THOMSON.,circumstances. The feudal lord had it infinitely more in his power to be
1397,THOMSON.,"rapacious than the merchant. And whatever avarice may attend the trader,"
1398,THOMSON.,his intercourse with the rest of mankind lifts him greatly above that
1399,THOMSON.,"brutish ferocity which actuates the savage, often the rustic, and in"
1400,THOMSON.,general characterizes the ignorant part of mankind. The abolition of the
1401,THOMSON.,"feudal system, a system of absolute slavery, and that equality of"
1402,THOMSON.,"mankind which affords the protection of property, and every other"
1403,THOMSON.,"incitement to industry, are the glorious gifts which the spirit of"
1404,THOMSON.,"commerce, awakened by Prince Henry of Portugal, has bestowed upon Europe"
1405,THOMSON.,"in general; and, as if directed by the manes of his mother, a daughter"
1406,THOMSON.,"of England, upon the British empire in particular. In the vice of"
1407,THOMSON.,"effeminacy alone, perhaps, do we exceed our ancestors; yet, even here we"
1408,THOMSON.,have infinitely the advantage over them. The brutal ferocity of former
1409,THOMSON.,"ages is now lost, and the general mind is humanized. The savage breast"
1410,THOMSON.,"is the native soil of revenge; a vice, of all others, peculiarly stamped"
1411,THOMSON.,with the character of hell. But the mention of this was reserved for the
1412,THOMSON.,character of the savages of Europe. The savage of every country is
1413,THOMSON.,"implacable when injured; but among some, revenge has its measure. When"
1414,THOMSON.,"an American Indian is murdered his kindred pursue the murderer; and, as"
1415,THOMSON.,"soon as blood has atoned for blood, the wilds of America hear the"
1416,THOMSON.,"hostile parties join in their mutual lamentations over the dead, whom,"
1417,THOMSON.,"as an oblivion of malice, they bury together. But the measure of"
1418,THOMSON.,"revenge, never to be full, was left for the demi-savages of Europe. The"
1419,THOMSON.,vassals of the feudal lord entered into his quarrels with the most
1420,THOMSON.,inexorable rage. Just or unjust was no consideration of theirs. It was a
1421,THOMSON.,"family feud; no farther inquiry was made; and from age to age, the"
1422,THOMSON.,"parties, who never injured each other, breathed nothing but mutual"
1423,THOMSON.,"rancour and revenge. And actions, suitable to this horrid spirit,"
1424,THOMSON.,everywhere confessed its virulent influence. Such were the late days of
1425,THOMSON.,"Europe, admired by the ignorant for the innocence of manners. Resentment"
1426,THOMSON.,"of injury, indeed, is natural; and there is a degree which is honest,"
1427,THOMSON.,"and though warm, far from inhuman. But if it is the hard task of"
1428,THOMSON.,humanized virtue to preserve the feeling of an injury unmixed with the
1429,THOMSON.,"slightest criminal wish of revenge, how impossible is it for the savage"
1430,THOMSON.,"to attain the dignity of forgiveness, the greatest ornament of human"
1431,THOMSON.,"nature. As in individuals, a virtue will rise into a vice, generosity"
1432,THOMSON.,"into blind profusion, and even mercy into criminal lenity, so civilized"
1433,THOMSON.,"manners will lead the opulent into effeminacy. But let it be considered,"
1434,THOMSON.,this consequence is by no means the certain result of civilization.
1435,THOMSON.,"Civilization, on the contrary, provides the most effectual preventive of"
1436,THOMSON.,this evil. Where classical literature prevails the manly spirit which it
1437,THOMSON.,"breathes must be diffused; whenever frivolousness predominates, when"
1438,THOMSON.,"refinement degenerates into whatever enervates the mind, literary"
1439,THOMSON.,ignorance is sure to complete the effeminate character. A mediocrity of
1440,THOMSON.,virtues and of talents is the lot of the great majority of mankind; and
1441,THOMSON.,"even this mediocrity, if cultivated by a liberal education, will"
1442,THOMSON.,infallibly secure its possessor against those excesses of effeminacy
1443,THOMSON.,which are really culpable. To be of plain manners it is not necessary to
1444,THOMSON.,"be a clown, or to wear coarse clothes; nor is it necessary to lie on the"
1445,THOMSON.,"ground and feed like the savage to be truly manly. The beggar who,"
1446,THOMSON.,"behind the hedge, divides his offals with his dog has often more of the"
1447,THOMSON.,real sensualist than he who dines at an elegant table. Nor need we
1448,THOMSON.,"hesitate to assert, that he who, unable to preserve a manly elegance of"
1449,THOMSON.,"manners, degenerates into the _petit maître_, would have been, in any"
1450,THOMSON.,"age or condition, equally insignificant and worthless. Some, when they"
1451,THOMSON.,"talk of the debauchery of the present age, seem to think that the former"
1452,THOMSON.,ages were all innocence. But this is ignorance of human nature. The
1453,THOMSON.,"debauchery of a barbarous age is gross and brutal; that of a gloomy,"
1454,THOMSON.,"superstitious one, secret, excessive, and murderous; that of a more"
1455,THOMSON.,"polished one, much happier for the fair sex,[30] and certainly in no"
1456,THOMSON.,sense so big with political unhappiness. If one disease has been
1457,THOMSON.,"imported from America,[31] the most valuable medicines have likewise"
1458,THOMSON.,"been brought from those regions; and distempers, which were thought"
1459,THOMSON.,"invincible by our forefathers, are now cured. If the luxuries of the"
1460,THOMSON.,Indies usher disease to our tables the consequence is not unknown; the
1461,THOMSON.,"wise and the temperate receive no injury, and intemperance has been the"
1462,THOMSON.,destroyer of mankind in every age. The opulence of ancient Rome produced
1463,THOMSON.,a luxury of manners which proved fatal to that mighty empire. But the
1464,THOMSON.,effeminate sensualists of those ages were not men of intellectual
1465,THOMSON.,"cultivation. The enlarged ideas, the generous and manly feelings"
1466,THOMSON.,"inspired by a liberal education, were utterly unknown to them. Unformed"
1467,THOMSON.,"by that wisdom which arises from science and true philosophy, they were"
1468,THOMSON.,"gross barbarians, dressed in the mere outward tinsel of"
1469,THOMSON.,civilization.[32] Where the enthusiasm of military honour characterizes
1470,THOMSON.,the rank of gentlemen that nation will rise into empire. But no sooner
1471,THOMSON.,does conquest give a continued security than the mere soldier
1472,THOMSON.,degenerates; and the old veterans are soon succeeded by a new
1473,THOMSON.,"generation, illiterate as their fathers, but destitute of their virtues"
1474,THOMSON.,"and experience. Polite literature not only humanizes the heart, but also"
1475,THOMSON.,wonderfully strengthens and enlarges the mind. Moral and political
1476,THOMSON.,"philosophy are its peculiar provinces, and are never happily cultivated"
1477,THOMSON.,"without its assistance. But, where ignorance characterizes the body of"
1478,THOMSON.,"the nobility, the most insipid dissipation and the very idleness and"
1479,THOMSON.,effeminacy of luxury are sure to follow. Titles and family are then the
1480,THOMSON.,"only merit, and the few men of business who surround the throne have it"
1481,THOMSON.,then in their power to aggrandize themselves by riveting the chains of
1482,THOMSON.,"slavery. A stately grandeur is preserved, but it is only outward; all is"
1483,THOMSON.,"decayed within, and on the first storm the weak fabric falls to the"
1484,THOMSON.,"dust. Thus rose and thus fell the empire of Rome, and the much wider one"
1485,THOMSON.,"of Portugal. Though the increase of wealth did, indeed, contribute to"
1486,THOMSON.,"that corruption of manners which unnerved the Portuguese, certain it is"
1487,THOMSON.,the wisdom of legislature might certainly have prevented every evil
1488,THOMSON.,which Spain and Portugal have experienced from their acquisitions in the
1489,THOMSON.,two Indies.[33] Every evil which they have suffered from their
1490,THOMSON.,"acquirements arose, as shall be hereafter demonstrated, from their"
1491,THOMSON.,"general ignorance, which rendered them unable to investigate or"
1492,THOMSON.,apprehend even the first principles of civil and commercial philosophy.
1493,THOMSON.,And what other than the total eclipse of their glory could be expected
1494,THOMSON.,"from a nobility, rude and unlettered as those of Portugal are described"
1495,THOMSON.,by the author of the Lusiad--a court and nobility who sealed the truth
1496,THOMSON.,"of all his complaints against them by suffering that great man, the"
1497,THOMSON.,"light of their age, to die in an almshouse! What but the fall of their"
1498,THOMSON.,state could be expected from barbarians like these! Nor can the annals
1499,THOMSON.,of mankind produce one instance of the fall of empire where the
1500,THOMSON.,character of the nobles was other than that ascribed to his countrymen
1501,THOMSON.,by Camoëns.

1513,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,No lesson can be of greater national importance than the history of the
1514,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,rise and the fall of a commercial empire. The view of what advantages
1515,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"were acquired, and of what might have been still added; the means by"
1516,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"which such empire might have been continued, and the errors by which it"
1517,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"was lost, are as particularly conspicuous in the naval and commercial"
1518,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,history of Portugal as if Providence had intended to give a lasting
1519,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"example to mankind; a chart, where the course of the safe voyage is"
1520,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"pointed out, and where the shelves and rocks, and the seasons of tempest"
1521,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,are discovered and foretold.
1522,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1523,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"The history of Portugal, as a naval and commercial power, begins with"
1524,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"the designs of Prince Henry. But as the enterprises of this great man,"
1525,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,and the completion of his designs are intimately connected with the
1526,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"state of Portugal, a short view of the progress of the power, and of the"
1527,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"character of that kingdom, will be necessary to elucidate the history of"
1528,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"the revival of commerce, and the subject of the Lusiad."
1529,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1530,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,During the centuries when the effeminated Roman provinces of Europe were
1531,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"desolated by the irruptions of the northern barbarians, the Saracens"
1532,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,spread the same horrors of brutal conquest over the finest countries of
1533,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,the eastern world. The northern conquerors of the finer provinces of
1534,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Europe embraced the Christian religion as professed by the monks, and,"
1535,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"contented with the luxuries of their new settlements, their military"
1536,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"spirit soon declined. The Saracens, on the other hand, having embraced"
1537,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"the religion of Mohammed, their rage for war received every addition"
1538,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,which can possibly be inspired by religious enthusiasm. Not only the
1539,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"spoils of the vanquished, but Paradise itself was to be obtained by"
1540,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,their sabres. Strengthened and inspired by a commission which they
1541,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"esteemed divine, the rapidity of their conquests far exceeded those of"
1542,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,the Goths and Vandals. The majority of the inhabitants of every country
1543,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"they subdued embraced their religion and imbibed their principles; thus,"
1544,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,the professors of Mohammedanism became the most formidable combination
1545,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,ever leagued together against the rest of mankind. Morocco and the
1546,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"adjacent countries had now received the doctrines of the Koran, and the"
1547,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,arms of the Saracens spread slaughter and desolation from the south of
1548,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Spain to Italy, and the islands of the Mediterranean. All the rapine and"
1549,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,carnage committed by the Gothic conquerors were now amply returned on
1550,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"their less warlike posterity. In Spain, and the province now called"
1551,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Portugal, the Mohammedans erected powerful kingdoms, and their lust of"
1552,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,conquest threatened destruction to every Christian power. But a romantic
1553,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,military spirit revived in Europe under the auspices of Charlemagne. The
1554,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Mohammedans, during the reign of this sovereign, made a most formidable"
1555,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,irruption into Europe; France in particular felt the weight of their
1556,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,fury. By the invention of new military honours that monarch drew the
1557,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"adventurous youth of every Christian power to his standards, which"
1558,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"eventually resulted in the crusades, the beginning of which, in"
1559,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"propriety, should be dated from his reign. Few indeed are the historians"
1560,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"of this period, but enough remains to prove, that though the writers of"
1561,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"the old romance seized upon it, and added the inexhaustible machinery of"
1562,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"magic to the adventures of their heroes, yet the origin of their"
1563,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"fictions was founded on historical facts.[34] Yet, however this period"
1564,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"may thus resemble the fabulous ages of Greece, certain it is, that an"
1565,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Orlando, a Rinaldo, a Rugero, and other celebrated names in romance,"
1566,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,acquired great honour in the wars which were waged against the
1567,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Saracens, the invaders of Europe. In these romantic wars, by which the"
1568,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"power of the Mohammedans was checked, several centuries elapsed, when"
1569,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Alonzo, King of Castile, apprehensive that the whole force of the"
1570,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Mohammedans of Spain and Morocco was ready to fall upon him, prudently"
1571,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,imitated the conduct of Charlemagne. He availed himself of the spirit of
1572,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"chivalry, and demanded leave of Philip I. of France, and other princes,"
1573,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,that volunteers from their dominions might be allowed to distinguish
1574,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"themselves, under his banners, against the Saracens. His desire was no"
1575,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"sooner known than a brave army of volunteers thronged to his standard,"
1576,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,and Alonzo was victorious. Honours and endowments were liberally
1577,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"distributed among the champions; and to Henry, a younger son of the Duke"
1578,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"of Burgundy, he gave his daughter, Teresa, in marriage, with the"
1579,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"sovereignty of the countries south of Galicia as a dowry, commissioning"
1580,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"him to extend his dominions by the expulsion of the Moors. Henry, who"
1581,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"reigned by the title of Count, improved every advantage which offered."
1582,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"The two rich provinces of Entro Minho e Douro, and Tras os Montes,"
1583,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"yielded to his arms; great part of Beira also was subdued, and the"
1584,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,Moorish King of Lamego became his tributary. Many thousands of
1585,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Christians, who had lived in miserable subjection to the Moors, took"
1586,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,shelter under the generous protection of Count Henry. Great numbers of
1587,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"the Moors also changed their religion, and chose rather to continue in"
1588,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,the land where they were born than be exposed to the severities and
1589,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"injustice of their native governors. And thus, one of the most"
1590,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"beautiful[35] and fertile spots of the world, with the finest climate,"
1591,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"in consequence of a crusade[36] against the Mohammedans, became in the"
1592,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"end the kingdom of Portugal, a sovereignty which in course of time"
1593,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,spread its influence far over the world.
1594,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1595,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Count Henry, after a successful reign, was succeeded by his infant son,"
1596,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Don Alonzo-Henry, who, having surmounted the dangers which threatened"
1597,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"his youth, became the founder of the Portuguese monarchy. In 1139 the"
1598,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,Moors of Spain and Barbary united their forces to recover the dominions
1599,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,from which they had been driven by the Christians. According to the
1600,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"accounts of the Portuguese writers, the Moorish army amounted to near"
1601,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"400,000 men; nor is this number incredible when we consider what armies"
1602,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"they at other times have brought into the field, and that at this time"
1603,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,they came to take possession of lands from which they had been expelled.
1604,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Don Alonzo, however, with a very small army, gave them battle on the"
1605,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"plains of Ourique, and after a struggle of six hours, obtained a most"
1606,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"glorious and complete victory, and one which was crowned with an event"
1607,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,of the utmost importance. On the field of battle Don Alonzo was
1608,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"proclaimed King of Portugal by his victorious soldiers, and he in return"
1609,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,conferred the rank of nobility on the whole army. The constitution of
1610,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"the monarchy, however, was not settled, nor was Alonzo invested with the"
1611,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,regalia till six years after this memorable victory. The kind of
1612,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,government the Portuguese had submitted to under the Spaniards and
1613,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Moors, and the advantages which they saw were derived from their own"
1614,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"valour, had taught them the love of liberty, while Alonzo himself"
1615,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,understood the spirit of his subjects too well to make the least attempt
1616,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,to set himself up as a despotic monarch. After six years spent in
1617,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"further victories, he called an assembly of the prelates, nobility, and"
1618,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"commons, to meet at Lamego. When the assembly opened, Alonzo appeared"
1619,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"seated on the throne, but without any other mark of regal dignity."
1620,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Before he was crowned, the constitution of the state was settled, and"
1621,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,eighteen statutes were solemnly confirmed by oath[37] as the charter of
1622,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,king and people; statutes diametrically opposite to the divine right and
1623,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"arbitrary power of kings, principles which inculcate and demand the"
1624,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,unlimited passive obedience of the subject.
1625,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1626,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,The founders of the Portuguese monarchy transmitted to their heirs those
1627,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,generous principles of liberty which complete and adorn the martial
1628,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"character. The ardour of the volunteer, an ardour unknown to the slave"
1629,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"and the mercenary, added to the most romantic ideas of military glory,"
1630,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,characterized the Portuguese under the reigns of their first monarchs.
1631,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Engaged in almost continual war with the Moors, this spirit rose higher"
1632,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,and higher; and the desire to extirpate Mohammedanism--the principle
1633,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,which animated the wish of victory in every battle--seemed to take
1634,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"deeper root in every age. Such were the manners, and such the principles"
1635,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,of the people who were governed by the successors of Alonzo I.--a
1636,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,succession of great men who proved themselves worthy to reign over so
1637,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,military and enterprising a nation.
1638,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1639,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,By a continued train of victories the Portuguese had the honour to drive
1640,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,the Moors from Europe. The invasions of European soil by these people
1641,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,were now requited by successful expeditions into Africa. Such was the
1642,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"manly spirit of these ages, that the statutes of Lamego received"
1643,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"additional articles in favour of liberty, a convincing proof that the"
1644,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,general heroism of a people depends upon the principles of freedom.
1645,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Alonzo IV.,[38] though not an amiable character, was perhaps the"
1646,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"greatest warrior, politician, and monarch of his age. After a reign of"
1647,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"military splendour, he left his throne to his son Pedro, surnamed the"
1648,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,Just. Ideas of equity and literature were now diffused by this great
1649,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"prince,[39] who was himself a polite scholar, and a most accomplished"
1650,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,gentleman. Portugal began to perceive the advantages of cultivated
1651,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"talents, and to feel its superiority over the barbarous politics of the"
1652,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"ignorant Moors. The great Pedro, however, was succeeded by a weak"
1653,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"prince, and the heroic spirit of the Portuguese seemed to exist no more"
1654,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"under his son Fernando, surnamed the Careless."
1655,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1656,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,Under John I.[40] all the virtues of the Portuguese again shone forth
1657,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"with redoubled lustre. Happily for Portugal, his father had bestowed an"
1658,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"excellent education upon this prince, which, added to his great natural"
1659,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"talents, rendered him one of the greatest of monarchs. Conscious of the"
1660,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"superiority which his own liberal education gave him, he was assiduous"
1661,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"to bestow the same advantages upon his children, and he himself often"
1662,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,became their preceptor in science and useful knowledge. Fortunate in all
1663,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"his affairs, he was most of all fortunate in his family. He had many"
1664,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"sons, and he lived to see them become men of parts and of action, whose"
1665,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,only emulation was to show affection to his person and to support his
1666,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,administration by their great abilities.
1667,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1668,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"All the sons of John excelled in military exercises, and in the"
1669,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,literature of their age; Don Edward and Don Pedro[41] were particularly
1670,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"educated for the cabinet, and the mathematical genius of Don Henry"
1671,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,received every encouragement which a king and a father could give to
1672,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,ripen it into perfection and public utility.
1673,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1674,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"History was well known to Prince Henry, and his turn of mind peculiarly"
1675,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,enabled him to make political observations upon it. The history of
1676,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,ancient Tyre and Carthage showed him what a maritime nation might hope
1677,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,to become; and the flourishing colonies of the Greeks were the frequent
1678,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,topic of his conversation. Where Grecian commerce extended its influence
1679,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"the deserts became cultivated fields, cities rose, and men were drawn"
1680,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"from the woods and caverns to unite in society. The Romans, on the other"
1681,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"hand, when they destroyed Carthage, buried in her ruins the fountain of"
1682,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"civilization, improvement and opulence. They extinguished the spirit of"
1683,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"commerce, and the agriculture of the conquered nations. And thus, while"
1684,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"the luxury of Rome consumed the wealth of her provinces, her"
1685,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,uncommercial policy dried up the sources of its continuance. Nor were
1686,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,the inestimable advantages of commerce the sole motives of Henry. All
1687,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,the ardour that the love of his country could awaken conspired to
1688,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,stimulate the natural turn of his genius for the improvement of
1689,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,navigation.
1690,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1691,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"As the kingdom of Portugal had been wrested from the Moors, and"
1692,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"established by conquest, so its existence still depended on the"
1693,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"superiority of force of arms; and even before the birth of Henry, the"
1694,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,superiority of the Portuguese navies had been of the utmost consequence
1695,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"to the protection of the state. Whatever, therefore, might curb the"
1696,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"power of the Moors, was of the utmost importance to the existence of"
1697,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,Portugal. Such were the views and circumstances which united to inspire
1698,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"the designs of Henry, designs which were powerfully enforced by the"
1699,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,religion of that prince. Desire to extirpate Mohammedanism was
1700,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,synonymous with patriotism in Portugal. It was the principle which gave
1701,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"birth to, and supported their monarchy. Their kings avowed it; and"
1702,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Prince Henry always professed, that to propagate the Gospel and"
1703,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"extirpate Mohammedanism, was the great purpose of all his enterprises."
1704,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"The same principles, it is certain, inspired King Emmanuel, under whom"
1705,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,the eastern world was discovered by Gama.[42]
1706,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1707,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"The crusades, which had rendered the greatest political service to Spain"
1708,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"and Portugal, had begun now to have some effect upon the commerce of"
1709,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Europe. The Hanse Towns had received charters of liberty, and had united"
1710,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,together for the protection of their trade against the pirates of the
1711,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,Baltic. The Lombards had opened a lucrative traffic with the ports of
1712,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Egypt, from whence they imported into Europe the riches of India; and"
1713,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Bruges, the mart between them and the Hanse Towns, was, in consequence,"
1714,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"surrounded with the best agriculture of these ages,[43] a certain proof"
1715,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,of the dependence of agriculture upon the extent of commerce. The Hanse
1716,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Towns were liable, however, to be buried in the victories of a tyrant,"
1717,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,and the trade with Egypt was exceedingly insecure and precarious. Europe
1718,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,was still enveloped in the dark mists of ignorance; commerce still
1719,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"crept, in an infant state, along the coasts, nor were the ships adapted"
1720,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,for long voyages. A successful tyrant might have overwhelmed the system
1721,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"of commerce entirely, for it stood on a much narrower basis than in the"
1722,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,days of Phoenician and Greek colonization. A broader and more permanent
1723,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,foundation of commerce than the world had yet seen was wanting to bless
1724,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"mankind, and Henry, Duke of Viseo, was born to give it."
1725,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1726,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"In order to promote his designs, Prince Henry was appointed"
1727,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Commander-in-chief of the Portuguese forces in Africa. He had already,"
1728,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"in 1412, three years before the reduction of Ceuta,[44] sent a ship to"
1729,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,make discoveries on the Barbary coast. Cape Nam[45] (as its name
1730,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,implies) was then the _ne plus ultra_ of European navigation; the ship
1731,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"sent by Henry, however, passed it sixty leagues, and reached Cape"
1732,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,Bojador. About a league and a half from Cape St. Vincent (supposed to be
1733,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"the Promontorium Sacrum of the Romans), Prince Henry built his town of"
1734,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Sagrez, the best planned and fortified town in Portugal. Here, where the"
1735,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"view of the ocean inspired his hopes, he erected his arsenals, and built"
1736,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"and harboured his ships. And here, leaving the temporary bustle and"
1737,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"cares of the State to his father and brothers, he retired like a"
1738,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,philosopher from the world in order to promote its happiness. Having
1739,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"received all the information he could obtain in Africa, he continued"
1740,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,unwearied in his mathematical and geographical studies; the art of
1741,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"ship-building received amazing improvement under his direction, and the"
1742,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,correctness of his ideas of the structure of the globe is now confirmed.
1743,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"He it was who first suggested the use of the mariner's compass, and of"
1744,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"longitude and latitude in navigation, and demonstrated how these might"
1745,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,be ascertained by astronomical observations. Naval adventurers were now
1746,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"invited from all parts to the town of Sagrez, and in 1418 Juan Gonsalez"
1747,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Zarco and Tristran Vaz set sail on an expedition of discovery, the"
1748,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,circumstances of which give us a striking picture of the state of
1749,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,navigation ere it was remodelled by the genius of Henry.
1750,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1751,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Cape Bojador, so named from its extent,[46] runs about forty leagues to"
1752,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"the westward, and for about six leagues off land there is a most violent"
1753,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"current, which, dashing upon the shallows, makes a tempestuous sea. This"
1754,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"was deemed impassable, for it had not occurred to any one that by"
1755,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,standing out to sea the current might be avoided. To pass this
1756,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"formidable Cape was the commission of Zarco and Vaz, who were also"
1757,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"ordered to survey the African coast, which, according to the information"
1758,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"given to Henry by the Moors, extended to the Equator. Zarco and Vaz,"
1759,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"however, lost their course in a storm, and were driven to a small"
1760,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"island, which, in the joy of their deliverance, they named Puerto Santo,"
1761,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,or the Holy Haven. Nor was Prince Henry less joyful of their discovery
1762,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,than they had been of their escape: sufficient proof of the miserable
1763,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,state of navigation in those days; for this island is only a few days'
1764,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,voyage from Sagrez.
1765,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1766,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"The discoverers of Puerto Santo, accompanied by Bartholomew Perestrello,"
1767,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"were, with three ships, sent out on farther trial. Perestrello, having"
1768,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"sown some seeds and left some cattle at Puerto Santo, returned to"
1769,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Portugal.[47] Zarco and Vaz directing their course southward, in 1419,"
1770,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"perceived something like a cloud on the water, and sailing towards it,"
1771,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"discovered an island covered with woods, which from this circumstance"
1772,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,they named Madeira.[48] And this rich and beautiful island was the first
1773,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,reward of the enterprises of Prince Henry.
1774,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1775,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Nature calls upon Portugal to be a maritime power, and her naval"
1776,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"superiority over the Moors, was, in the time of Henry, the surest"
1777,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"defence of her existence as a kingdom. Yet, though all his labours"
1778,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"tended to establish that naval superiority on the surest basis, though"
1779,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,even the religion of the age added its authority to the clearest
1780,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"political principles in favour of Henry, yet were his enterprises and"
1781,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"his expected discoveries derided with all the insolence of ignorance,"
1782,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"and the bitterness of popular clamour. Barren deserts like Lybia, it was"
1783,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"said, were all that could be found, and a thousand disadvantages, drawn"
1784,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"from these data, were foreseen and foretold. The great mind and better"
1785,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"knowledge of Henry, however, were not thus to be shaken. Twelve years"
1786,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,had elapsed since the discovery of Madeira in unsuccessful endeavours to
1787,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"carry navigation farther. At length, one of his captains, named"
1788,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Galianez, in 1434 passed the Cape of Bojador, till then invincible; an"
1789,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"action, says Faria, not inferior to the labours of Hercules."
1790,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1791,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Galianez, the next year, accompanied by Gonsalez Baldaya, carried his"
1792,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,discoveries many leagues farther. Having put two horsemen on shore to
1793,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"discover the face of the country, the adventurers, after riding several"
1794,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"hours, saw nineteen men armed with javelins. The natives fled, and the"
1795,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"two horsemen pursued, till one of the Portuguese, being wounded, lost"
1796,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,the first blood that was sacrificed to the new system of commerce. A
1797,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"small beginning, it soon swelled into oceans, and deluged the eastern"
1798,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"and western worlds. The cruelties of Hernando Cortez, and that more"
1799,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"horrid barbarian, Pizarro,[49] are no more to be charged upon Don Henry"
1800,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"and Columbus, than the villainies of the Jesuits and the horrors of the"
1801,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,Inquisition are to be ascribed to Him who commands us to do to our
1802,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"neighbour as we would wish our neighbour to do to us. But, if it be"
1803,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,maintained that he who plans a discovery ought to foresee the miseries
1804,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"which the vicious will engraft upon his enterprise, let the objector be"
1805,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"told that the miseries are uncertain, while the advantages are real and"
1806,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,sure.
1807,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1808,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,In 1440 Anthony Gonsalez brought some Moors prisoners to Lisbon. These
1809,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"he took two and forty leagues beyond Cape Bojador, and in 1442 he"
1810,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"returned with his captives. One Moor escaped, but ten blacks of Guinea"
1811,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,and a considerable quantity of gold dust were given in ransom for two
1812,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"others. A rivulet at the place of landing was named by Gonsalez, Rio del"
1813,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Oro, or the River of Gold. And the islands of Adeget, Arguim, and De las"
1814,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,Garças were now discovered.
1815,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1816,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"The negroes of Guinea, the first ever seen in Portugal, and the gold"
1817,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"dust, excited other passions beside admiration. A company was formed at"
1818,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Lagos, under the auspices of Prince Henry, to carry on a traffic with"
1819,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"the newly discovered countries; and, as the Portuguese considered"
1820,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"themselves in a state of continual hostility with the Moors, about two"
1821,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"hundred of these people, inhabitants of the Islands of Nar and Tider, in"
1822,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"1444, were brought prisoners to Portugal. Next year Gonzalo de Cintra"
1823,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"was attacked by the Moors, fourteen leagues beyond Rio del Oro, where,"
1824,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"with seven of his men, he was killed."
1825,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1826,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"This hostile proceeding displeased Prince Henry, and in 1446 Anthony"
1827,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,Gonsalez and two other captains were sent to enter into a treaty of
1828,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"peace and traffic with the natives of Rio del Oro, and also to attempt"
1829,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"their conversion. But these proposals were rejected by the barbarians,"
1830,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"one of whom, however, came voluntarily to Portugal, and Juan Fernandez"
1831,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"remained with the natives, to observe their manners and the products of"
1832,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,the country.
1833,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1834,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,In 1447 upwards of thirty ships followed the route of traffic which was
1835,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,now opened; and John de Castilla obtained the infamy to stand the first
1836,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,on the list of those names whose villainies have disgraced the spirit of
1837,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"commerce, and afforded the loudest complaints against the progress of"
1838,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"navigation. Dissatisfied with the value of his cargo, he seized twenty"
1839,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"of the natives of Gomera (one of the Canaries), who had assisted him,"
1840,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"and with whom he was in friendly alliance, and brought them as slaves to"
1841,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Portugal. But Prince Henry resented this outrage, and having given them"
1842,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"some valuable presents of clothes, restored the captives to freedom and"
1843,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,their native country.
1844,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1845,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,The reduction of the Canaries was also this year attempted; but Spain
1846,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"having challenged the discovery of these islands, the expedition was"
1847,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,discontinued. In the Canary Islands a singular feudal custom existed;
1848,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"giving to the chief man, or governor, a temporary right to the person of"
1849,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,every bride in his district.
1850,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1851,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,In 1448 Fernando Alonzo was sent ambassador to the king of Cape Verde
1852,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"with a treaty of trade and conversion, which was defeated at that time"
1853,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,by the treachery of the natives. In 1449 the Azores were discovered by
1854,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,Gonsalo Vello; and the coast sixty leagues beyond Cape Verde was visited
1855,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,by the fleets of Henry. It is also certain that some of his commanders
1856,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,passed the equinoctial line.
1857,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1858,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Prince Henry had now, with inflexible perseverance, prosecuted his"
1859,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"discoveries for upwards of forty years. His father, John I., concurred"
1860,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"with him in his views, and gave him every assistance; his brother, King"
1861,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Edward, during his short reign, took the same interest in his"
1862,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,expeditions as his father had done; nor was the eleven years' regency
1863,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,of his brother Don Pedro less auspicious to him.[50] But the
1864,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"misunderstanding between Pedro and his nephew Alonzo V., who took upon"
1865,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"him the reins of government in his seventeenth year, retarded the"
1866,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"designs of Henry, and gave him much unhappiness.[51] At his town of"
1867,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Sagrez, from whence he had not moved for many years, Don Henry, now in"
1868,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"his sixty-seventh year, yielded to the stroke of fate, in the year of"
1869,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"our Lord 1463, gratified with the certain prospect that the route to the"
1870,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,eastern world would one day crown the enterprises to which he had given
1871,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,birth. He saw with pleasure the naval superiority of his country over
1872,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"the Moors established on the must solid basis, its trade greatly upon"
1873,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"the increase, and flattered himself that he had given a mortal wound to"
1874,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Mohammedanism. To him, as to their primary author, are due all the"
1875,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"inestimable advantages which ever have flowed, or ever will flow from"
1876,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"the discovery of the greatest part of Africa, and of the East and West"
1877,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Indies. Every improvement in the state and manners of these countries,"
1878,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"or whatever country may be yet discovered, is strictly due to him. What"
1879,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"is an Alexander, crowned with trophies at the head of his army, compared"
1880,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,with a Henry contemplating the ocean from his window on the rock of
1881,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Sagrez! The one suggests the idea of a destroying demon, the other of a"
1882,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,benevolent Deity.
1883,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1884,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"From 1448, when Alonzo V. assumed the power of government, till the end"
1885,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"of his reign in 1471, little progress was made in maritime affairs. Cape"
1886,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Catherine alone was added to the former discoveries. But under his son,"
1887,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"John II., the designs of Prince Henry were prosecuted with renewed"
1888,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"vigour. In 1481 the Portuguese built a fort on the Gold Coast, and the"
1889,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"King of Portugal took the title of Lord of Guinea. Bartholomew Diaz, in"
1890,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"1486, reached the river which he named _dell'Infante_ on the eastern"
1891,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"side of Africa, but deterred by the storms of that coast from proceeding"
1892,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"farther, on his return he had the happiness to be the discoverer of the"
1893,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"promontory, unknown for many ages, which bounds the south of Africa."
1894,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,From the storms he there encountered he named it Cape of Storms; but
1895,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"John, elated with the promise of India, which this discovery, as he"
1896,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"justly deemed, included, gave it the name of the Cape of Good Hope. The"
1897,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,arts and valour of the Portuguese had now made a great impression on the
1898,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,minds of the Africans. The King of Congo sent the sons of some of his
1899,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"principal officers to Lisbon, to be instructed in arts and religion; and"
1900,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,ambassadors from the King of Benin requested teachers to be sent to his
1901,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"kingdom. On the return of his subjects, the King and Queen of Congo,"
1902,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"with 100,000 of their people, were baptized. An ambassador also arrived"
1903,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"from the Christian Emperor of Abyssinia, and Pedro de Covillam and"
1904,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Alonzo de Payva were sent by land to penetrate into the East, that they"
1905,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,might acquire whatever intelligence might facilitate the desired
1906,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"navigation to India. Covillam and Payva parted at Toro in Arabia, and"
1907,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"took different routes. The former having visited Conanor, Calicut, and"
1908,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Goa in India, returned to Cairo, where he heard of the death of his"
1909,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"companion. Here also he met the Rabbi Abraham of Beja, who was employed"
1910,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,for the same purpose by King John. Covillam sent the Rabbi home with an
1911,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"account of what countries he had seen, and he himself proceeded to Ormuz"
1912,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"and Ethiopia, but, as Camoëns expresses it--"
1913,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1914,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"""To _his_ native shore,"
1915,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Enrich'd with knowledge, _he_ return'd no more."""
1916,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1917,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Men, whose genius led them to maritime affairs began now to be possessed"
1918,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,by an ardent ambition to distinguish themselves; and the famous Columbus
1919,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"offered his service to King John, and was rejected. Every one knows the"
1920,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"discoveries of this great adventurer, but his history is generally"
1921,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"misunderstood.[52] The simple truth is, Columbus, who acquired his"
1922,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"skill in navigation among the Portuguese, could be no stranger to the"
1923,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"design, long meditated in that kingdom, of discovering a naval route to"
1924,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"India, which, according to ancient geographers and the opinion of that"
1925,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"age, was supposed to be the next land to the west of Spain. And that"
1926,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,India and the adjacent islands were the regions sought by Columbus is
1927,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"also certain. John, who esteemed the route to India as almost"
1928,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"discovered, and in the power of his own subjects, rejected the proposals"
1929,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,of the foreigner. But Columbus met a more favourable reception from
1930,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Ferdinand and Isabella, the king and queen of Castile. Columbus,"
1931,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"therefore, proposed, as Magalhaens afterwards did, for the same reason,"
1932,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"to steer a westward course, and having in 1492 discovered some western"
1933,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"islands, in 1493, on his return to Spain, he put into the Tagus with"
1934,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,great tokens of the riches of his discovery. Some of the Portuguese
1935,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"courtiers (the same ungenerous minds, perhaps, who advised the rejection"
1936,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,of Columbus because he was a foreigner) proposed the assassination of
1937,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"that great man, thereby to conceal from Spain the advantages of his"
1938,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"navigation. But John, though Columbus rather roughly upbraided him,"
1939,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"looked upon him now with a generous regret, and dismissed him with"
1940,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"honour. The King of Portugal, however, alarmed lest the discoveries of"
1941,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Columbus should interfere with those of his crown, gave orders to equip"
1942,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,a war-fleet to protect his rights. But matters were adjusted by
1943,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"embassies, and that celebrated treaty was drawn up by which Spain and"
1944,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,Portugal divided the western and eastern worlds between them. The
1945,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"eastern half of the world was allotted for the Portuguese, and the"
1946,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"western for the Spanish navigation. A Papal Bull also, which, for"
1947,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"obvious reasons, prohibited the propagation of the gospel in these"
1948,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"bounds by the subjects of any other state, confirmed this amicable and"
1949,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,extraordinary treaty.
1950,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1951,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Soon after this, however, while the thoughts of King John were intent on"
1952,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"the discovery of India, his preparations were interrupted by his death."
1953,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"But his earnest desires and great designs were inherited, together with"
1954,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"his crown, by his cousin Emmanuel; and in 1497 (the year before Columbus"
1955,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"made the voyage in which he discovered the mouth of the river Oronoko),"
1956,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,Vasco de Gama sailed from the Tagus for the discovery of India.
1957,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1958,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Of this voyage, the subject of the Lusiad, many particulars are"
1959,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,necessarily mentioned in the notes; we shall therefore only allude to
1960,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"these, but be more explicit on the others, which are omitted by Camoëns"
1961,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,in obedience to the rules of epic poetry.
1962,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1963,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Notwithstanding the popular clamour against the undertaking, Emmanuel"
1964,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,was determined to prosecute the views of Prince Henry and John II. Three
1965,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"sloops of war and a store ship, manned with only 160 men, were fitted"
1966,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,out; for hostility was not the purpose of this expedition. Vasco de
1967,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Gama, a gentleman of good family, who, in a war with the French, had"
1968,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"given signal proofs of his naval skill, was commissioned admiral and"
1969,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"general, and his brother Paul, with his friend Nicholas Coello, were"
1970,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,appointed to command under him. It is the greatest honour of kings to
1971,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"distinguish the characters of their officers, and to employ them"
1972,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"accordingly. Emmanuel in many instances was happy in this talent,"
1973,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,particularly in the choice of his admiral for the discovery of India.
1974,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"All the enthusiasm of desire to accomplish his end, joined with the"
1975,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"greatest heroism, the quickest penetration, and coolest prudence, united"
1976,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,to form the character of Gama. On his appointment he confessed to the
1977,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,king that his mind had long aspired to this expedition. The king
1978,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"expressed great confidence in his prudence and honour, and gave him,"
1979,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"with his own hand, the colours which he was to carry. On this banner,"
1980,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"which bore the cross of the military Order of Christ, Gama, with great"
1981,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"enthusiasm, took the oath of fidelity."
1982,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
1983,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"About four miles from Lisbon is a chapel on the sea side. To this, the"
1984,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"day before their departure, Gama conducted the companions of his"
1985,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"expedition. He was to encounter an ocean untried, and dreaded as"
1986,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"unnavigable, and he knew the power of religion on minds which are not"
1987,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,inclined to dispute its authority. The whole night was spent in the
1988,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"chapel in prayers for success, and in the rites of their devotion. The"
1989,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"next day, when the adventurers marched to the fleet, the shore of"
1990,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,Belem[53] presented one of the most solemn and affecting scenes perhaps
1991,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,recorded in history. The beach was covered with the inhabitants of
1992,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Lisbon. A procession of priests, in their robes, sang anthems and"
1993,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,offered up invocations to heaven. Every one looked on the adventurers as
1994,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,brave men going to a dreadful execution; as rushing upon certain death;
1995,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"and the vast multitude caught the fire of devotion, and joined aloud in"
1996,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"prayers for their success. The relations, friends, and acquaintances of"
1997,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,the voyagers wept; all were affected; the sight was general; Gama
1998,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"himself shed manly tears on parting with his friends, but he hurried"
1999,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"over the tender scene, and hastened on board with all the alacrity of"
2000,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"hope. He set sail immediately, and so much affected were the thousands"
2001,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"who beheld his departure, that they remained immovable on the shore,"
2002,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"till the fleet, under full sail, vanished from their sight."
2003,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
2004,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,It was on the 8th of July when Gama left the Tagus. The flag ship was
2005,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"commanded by himself, the second by his brother, the third by Coello,"
2006,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"and the store ship by Gonsalo Nunio. Several interpreters, skilled in"
2007,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Arabic, and other oriental languages, went along with them. Ten"
2008,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"malefactors (men of abilities, whose sentences of death were reversed,"
2009,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,on condition of their obedience to Gama in whatever embassies or dangers
2010,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"among the barbarians he might think proper to employ them), were also on"
2011,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"board. The fleet, favoured by the weather, passed the Canary and Cape de"
2012,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Verde islands, but had now to encounter other fortune. Sometimes stopped"
2013,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"by dead calms, but for the most part tossed by tempests, which increased"
2014,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,in violence as they proceeded to the south. Thus driven far to sea they
2015,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"laboured through that wide ocean which surrounds St. Helena, in seas,"
2016,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"says Faria, unknown to the Portuguese discoverers, none of whom had"
2017,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"sailed so far to the west. From the 28th of July, the day they passed"
2018,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"the isle of St. James, they had seen no shore, and now on November the"
2019,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,4th they were happily relieved by the sight of land. The fleet anchored
2020,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"in the large bay,[54] and Coello was sent in search of a river where"
2021,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"they might take in wood and fresh water. Having found one, the fleet"
2022,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"made towards it, and Gama, whose orders were to acquaint himself with"
2023,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"the manners of the people wherever he touched, ordered a party of his"
2024,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"men to bring him some of the natives by force, or stratagem. One they"
2025,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"caught as he was gathering honey on the side of a mountain, and brought"
2026,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,him to the fleet. He expressed the greatest indifference about the gold
2027,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"and fine clothes which they showed him, but was greatly delighted with"
2028,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"some glasses and little brass bells. These with great joy he accepted,"
2029,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"and was set on shore; and soon after many of the blacks came for, and"
2030,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"were gratified with, the like trifles; in return for which they gave"
2031,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"plenty of their best provisions. None of Gama's interpreters, however,"
2032,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"could understand a word of their language, or obtain any information of"
2033,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"India. The friendly intercourse between the fleet and the natives was,"
2034,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"however, soon interrupted by the imprudence of Veloso, a young"
2035,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Portuguese, which occasioned a skirmish wherein Gama's life was"
2036,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,endangered. Gama and some others were on shore taking the altitude of
2037,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"the sun, when in consequence of Veloso's rashness they were attacked by"
2038,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"the blacks with great fury. Gama defended himself with an oar, and"
2039,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"received a dart in his foot. Several others were likewise wounded, and"
2040,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,they found safety in retreat. A discharge of cannon from the ships
2041,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"facilitated their escape, and Gama, esteeming it imprudent to waste his"
2042,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"strength in attempts entirely foreign to the design of his voyage,"
2043,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"weighed anchor, and steered in search of the extremity of Africa."
2044,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
2045,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"In this part of the voyage, says Osorius, ""The heroism of Gama was"
2046,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"greatly displayed."" The waves swelled up like mountains, the ships"
2047,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"seemed at one time heaved up to the clouds, and at another precipitated"
2048,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"to the bed of the ocean. The winds were piercing cold, and so boisterous"
2049,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"that the pilot's voice could seldom be heard, and a dismal darkness,"
2050,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"which at that tempestuous season involves these seas, added all its"
2051,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"horrors. Sometimes the storm drove them southward, at other times they"
2052,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"were obliged to stand on the tack and yield to its fury, preserving what"
2053,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,they had gained with the greatest difficulty.
2054,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,
2055,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"""With such mad seas the daring Gama fought"
2056,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"For many a day, and many a dreadful night,"
2057,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"Incessant labouring round the stormy Cape,"
2058,DISCOVERY OF INDIA.,"By bold ambition led."""

2061,THOMSON.,
2062,THOMSON.,"During any interval of the storm, the sailors, wearied out with fatigue,"
2063,THOMSON.,"and abandoned to despair, surrounded Gama, and implored him not to"
2064,THOMSON.,"suffer himself, and those committed to his care, to perish by so"
2065,THOMSON.,dreadful a death. The impossibility that men so weakened could endure
2066,THOMSON.,"much longer, and the opinion that this ocean was torn by eternal"
2067,THOMSON.,"tempest, and therefore had hitherto been, and was impassable, were"
2068,THOMSON.,urged. But Gama's resolution to proceed was unalterable.[55] A
2069,THOMSON.,conspiracy was then formed against his life. But his brother discovered
2070,THOMSON.,"it, and the courage and prudence of Gama defeated its design. He put the"
2071,THOMSON.,"chief conspirators and all the pilots in irons, and he himself, his"
2072,THOMSON.,"brother, Coello, and some others, stood night and day at the helm and"
2073,THOMSON.,"directed the course. At last, after having many days, with unconquered"
2074,THOMSON.,"mind, withstood the tempest and mutiny (_molem perfidiæ_) the storm"
2075,THOMSON.,"suddenly ceased, and they beheld the Cape of Good Hope."
2076,THOMSON.,
2077,THOMSON.,"On November the 20th all the fleet doubled that promontory, and steering"
2078,THOMSON.,"northward, coasted along a rich and beautiful shore, adorned with large"
2079,THOMSON.,forests and numberless herds of cattle. All was now alacrity; the hope
2080,THOMSON.,"that they had surmounted every danger revived their spirits, and the"
2081,THOMSON.,"admiral was beloved and admired. Here, and at the bay, which they named"
2082,THOMSON.,"St. Blas, they took in provisions, and beheld these beautiful rural"
2083,THOMSON.,"scenes, described by Camoëns. And here the store sloop was burnt by"
2084,THOMSON.,order of the admiral. On December the 8th a violent tempest drove the
2085,THOMSON.,"fleet out of sight of land, and carried them to that dreadful current"
2086,THOMSON.,"which made the Moors deem it impossible to double the Cape. Gama,"
2087,THOMSON.,"however, though unlucky in the time of navigating these seas, was safely"
2088,THOMSON.,carried over the current by the violence of a tempest; and having
2089,THOMSON.,"recovered the sight of land, as his safest course he steered northward"
2090,THOMSON.,"along the coast. On the 10th of January they discovered, about 230 miles"
2091,THOMSON.,"from their last watering place, some beautiful islands, with herds of"
2092,THOMSON.,"cattle frisking in the meadows. It was a profound calm, and Gama stood"
2093,THOMSON.,near to land. The natives were better dressed and more civilized than
2094,THOMSON.,"those they had hitherto seen. An exchange of presents was made, and the"
2095,THOMSON.,"black king was so pleased with the politeness of Gama, that he came"
2096,THOMSON.,"aboard his ship to see him. At this place, which he named Terra de"
2097,THOMSON.,"Natal, Gama left two of the malefactors before mentioned to procure what"
2098,THOMSON.,"information they could against his return. On the 15th of January, in"
2099,THOMSON.,"the dusk of the evening, they came to the mouth of a large river, whose"
2100,THOMSON.,banks were shaded with trees laden with fruit. On the return of day they
2101,THOMSON.,"saw several little boats with palm-tree leaves making towards them, and"
2102,THOMSON.,the natives came aboard without hesitation or fear. Gama received them
2103,THOMSON.,"kindly, gave them an entertainment, and some silken garments, which they"
2104,THOMSON.,"received with visible joy. Only one of them, however, could speak a"
2105,THOMSON.,little broken Arabic. From him Fernan Martinho learned that not far
2106,THOMSON.,"distant was a country where ships, in shape and size like Gama's,"
2107,THOMSON.,"frequently resorted. This gave the fleet great encouragement, and the"
2108,THOMSON.,"admiral named this place ""The River of Good Signs."""
2109,THOMSON.,
2110,THOMSON.,"Here, while Gama refitted his ships, the crews were attacked with a"
2111,THOMSON.,"violent scurvy, which carried off several of his men. Having taken in"
2112,THOMSON.,"fresh provisions, on the 24th of February he set sail, and on the 1st of"
2113,THOMSON.,March they descried four islands on the coast of Mozambique. From one of
2114,THOMSON.,these they perceived seven vessels in full sail bearing to the fleet.
2115,THOMSON.,"The Râis, or captain, knew Gama's ship by the admiral's ensign, and made"
2116,THOMSON.,"up to her, saluting her with loud huzzas and instruments of music. Gama"
2117,THOMSON.,"received them aboard, and entertained them with great kindness. The"
2118,THOMSON.,"interpreters talked with them in Arabic. The island, in which was the"
2119,THOMSON.,"principal harbour and trading town, they said, was governed by a deputy"
2120,THOMSON.,"of the King of Quiloa; and many Arab merchants, they added, were settled"
2121,THOMSON.,"here, who traded with Arabia, India, and other parts of the world. Gama"
2122,THOMSON.,"was overjoyed, and the crew, with uplifted hands, returned thanks to"
2123,THOMSON.,Heaven.
2124,THOMSON.,
2125,THOMSON.,"Pleased with the presents which Gama sent him, and imagining that the"
2126,THOMSON.,"Portuguese were Mohammedans from Morocco, the governor, dressed in rich"
2127,THOMSON.,"embroidery, came to congratulate the admiral on his arrival in the east."
2128,THOMSON.,"As he approached the fleet in great pomp, Gama removed the sick out of"
2129,THOMSON.,"sight, and ordered all those in health to attend above deck, armed in"
2130,THOMSON.,the Portuguese manner; for he foresaw what would happen when the
2131,THOMSON.,Mohammedans should discover it was a Christian fleet. During the
2132,THOMSON.,"entertainment provided for him Zacocia seemed highly pleased, and asked"
2133,THOMSON.,several questions about the arms and religion of the strangers. Gama
2134,THOMSON.,"showed him his arms, and explained the force of his cannon, but he did"
2135,THOMSON.,not affect to know much about religion; however he frankly promised to
2136,THOMSON.,show him his books of devotion whenever a few days refreshment should
2137,THOMSON.,give him a more convenient time. In the meanwhile he entreated Zacocia
2138,THOMSON.,to send him some pilots who might conduct him to India. Two pilots were
2139,THOMSON.,"next day brought by the governor, a treaty of peace was solemnly"
2140,THOMSON.,"concluded, and every office of mutual friendship seemed to promise a"
2141,THOMSON.,"lasting harmony. But it was soon interrupted. Zacocia, as soon as he"
2142,THOMSON.,"found the Portuguese were Christians, used every endeavour to destroy"
2143,THOMSON.,the fleet. The life of Gama was attempted. One of the Moorish pilots
2144,THOMSON.,"deserted, and some of the Portuguese who were on shore to get fresh"
2145,THOMSON.,"water were attacked by the natives, but were rescued by a timely"
2146,THOMSON.,assistance from the ships.
2147,THOMSON.,
2148,THOMSON.,"Besides the hatred of the Christian name, inspired by their religion,"
2149,THOMSON.,the Arabs had other reasons to wish the destruction of Gama. Before this
2150,THOMSON.,"period, they were almost the only merchants of the East; they had"
2151,THOMSON.,"colonies in every place convenient for trade, and were the sole masters"
2152,THOMSON.,"of the Ethiopian, Arabian, and Indian seas. They clearly foresaw the"
2153,THOMSON.,"consequences of the arrival of Europeans, and every art was soon exerted"
2154,THOMSON.,to prevent such formidable rivals from effecting any footing in the
2155,THOMSON.,East. To these Mohammedan traders the Portuguese gave the name of Moors.
2156,THOMSON.,
2157,THOMSON.,"Immediately after the skirmish at the watering-place, Gama, having one"
2158,THOMSON.,"Moorish pilot, set sail, but was soon driven back by tempestuous"
2159,THOMSON.,weather. He now resolved to take in fresh water by force. The Moors
2160,THOMSON.,"perceiving his intention, about two thousand of them rising from ambush,"
2161,THOMSON.,attacked the Portuguese detachment. But the prudence of Gama had not
2162,THOMSON.,"been asleep. His ships were stationed with art, and his artillery not"
2163,THOMSON.,"only dispersed the hostile Moors, but reduced their town, which was"
2164,THOMSON.,"built of wood, into a heap of ashes. Among some prisoners taken by"
2165,THOMSON.,"Paulus de Gama was a pilot, and Zacocia begging forgiveness for his"
2166,THOMSON.,"treachery, sent another, whose skill in navigation he greatly commended."
2167,THOMSON.,
2168,THOMSON.,A war with the Moors was now begun. Gama perceived that their jealousy
2169,THOMSON.,of European rivals gave him nothing to expect but open hostility and
2170,THOMSON.,secret treachery; and he knew what numerous colonies they had on every
2171,THOMSON.,"trading coast of the East. To impress them, therefore, with the terror"
2172,THOMSON.,"of his arms on their first act of treachery, was worthy of a great"
2173,THOMSON.,commander. Nor was he remiss in his attention to the chief pilot who had
2174,THOMSON.,been last sent. He perceived in him a kind of anxious endeavour to bear
2175,THOMSON.,"near some little islands, and suspecting there were unseen rocks in that"
2176,THOMSON.,"course, he confidently charged the pilot with guilt, and ordered him to"
2177,THOMSON.,be severely whipped. The punishment produced a confession and promises
2178,THOMSON.,"of fidelity. And he now advised Gama to stand for Quiloa, which he"
2179,THOMSON.,assured him was inhabited by Christians. Three Ethiopian Christians had
2180,THOMSON.,"come aboard the fleet while at Zacocia's island, and the opinions then"
2181,THOMSON.,current about Prester John's country inclined Gama to try if he could
2182,THOMSON.,find a port where he might obtain the assistance of a people of his own
2183,THOMSON.,"religion. A violent storm, however, drove the fleet from Quiloa, and"
2184,THOMSON.,"being now near Mombas, the pilot advised him to enter that harbour,"
2185,THOMSON.,"where, he said, there were also many Christians."
2186,THOMSON.,
2187,THOMSON.,"The city of Mombas is agreeably situated on an island, formed by a river"
2188,THOMSON.,which empties itself into the sea by two mouths. The buildings are lofty
2189,THOMSON.,"and of solid stone, and the country abounds with fruit-trees and cattle."
2190,THOMSON.,"Gama, happy to find a harbour where everything wore the appearance of"
2191,THOMSON.,"civilization, ordered the fleet to cast anchor, which was scarcely done,"
2192,THOMSON.,"when a galley, in which were 100 men in oriental costume, armed with"
2193,THOMSON.,"bucklers and sabres, rowed up to the flag ship. All of these seemed"
2194,THOMSON.,"desirous to come on board, but only four, who by their dress seemed"
2195,THOMSON.,"officers, were admitted; nor were these allowed, till stripped of their"
2196,THOMSON.,arms. When on board they extolled the prudence of Gama in refusing
2197,THOMSON.,"admittance to armed strangers; and by their behaviour, seemed desirous"
2198,THOMSON.,"to gain the good opinion of the fleet. Their country, they boasted,"
2199,THOMSON.,"contained all the riches of India; and their king, they professed, was"
2200,THOMSON.,"ambitious of entering into a friendly treaty with the Portuguese, with"
2201,THOMSON.,"whose renown he was well acquainted. And, that a conference with his"
2202,THOMSON.,"majesty and the offices of friendship might be rendered more convenient,"
2203,THOMSON.,Gama was requested to enter the harbour. As no place could be more
2204,THOMSON.,"commodious for the recovery of the sick, Gama resolved to enter the"
2205,THOMSON.,port; and in the meanwhile sent two of the pardoned criminals as an
2206,THOMSON.,"embassy to the king. These the king treated with the greatest kindness,"
2207,THOMSON.,ordered his officers to show them the strength and opulence of his city;
2208,THOMSON.,"and, on their return to the navy, he sent a present to Gama of the most"
2209,THOMSON.,"valuable spices, of which he boasted such abundance, that the"
2210,THOMSON.,"Portuguese, he said, if they regarded their own interest, would seek for"
2211,THOMSON.,no other India.
2212,THOMSON.,
2213,THOMSON.,To make treaties of commerce was the business of Gama; and one so
2214,THOMSON.,advantageous was not to be refused. Fully satisfied by the report of his
2215,THOMSON.,"spies, he ordered to weigh anchor and enter the harbour. His own ship"
2216,THOMSON.,"led the way, when a sudden violence of the tide made Gama apprehensive"
2217,THOMSON.,"of running aground. He therefore ordered the sails to be furled, and the"
2218,THOMSON.,"anchors to be dropped, and gave a signal for the rest of the fleet to"
2219,THOMSON.,"follow his example. This manoeuvre, and the cries of the sailors in"
2220,THOMSON.,"executing it, alarmed the Mozambique pilots. Conscious of their"
2221,THOMSON.,"treachery, they thought their design was discovered, and leaped into the"
2222,THOMSON.,"sea. Some boats of Mombas took them up, and refusing to put them on"
2223,THOMSON.,"board, set them safely on shore, though the admiral repeatedly demanded"
2224,THOMSON.,the restoration of the pilots. These proofs of treachery were farther
2225,THOMSON.,confirmed by the behaviour of the King of Mombas. In the middle of the
2226,THOMSON.,"night Gama thought he heard some noise, and on examination, found his"
2227,THOMSON.,"fleet surrounded by a great number of Moors, who, with the utmost"
2228,THOMSON.,"secrecy, endeavoured to cut his cables. But their scheme was defeated;"
2229,THOMSON.,"and some Arabs, who remained on board, confessed that no Christians were"
2230,THOMSON.,resident either at Quiloa or Mombas. The storm which drove them from the
2231,THOMSON.,"one place, and their late escape at the other, were now beheld as"
2232,THOMSON.,"manifestations of the Divine favour, and Gama, holding up his hands to"
2233,THOMSON.,"heaven, ascribed his safety to the care of Providence.[56] Two days,"
2234,THOMSON.,"however, elapsed before they could get clear of the rocky bay of Mombas."
2235,THOMSON.,"Having now ventured to hoist their sails, they steered for Melinda, a"
2236,THOMSON.,"port, they had been told, where many merchants from India resorted. In"
2237,THOMSON.,"their way thither they took a Moorish vessel, out of which Gama selected"
2238,THOMSON.,"fourteen prisoners, one of whom he perceived by his mien to be a person"
2239,THOMSON.,"of distinction. By this Saracen, Gama was informed that he was near"
2240,THOMSON.,"Melinda, that the king was hospitable, and celebrated for his faith, and"
2241,THOMSON.,"that four ships from India, commanded by Christian masters, were in that"
2242,THOMSON.,"harbour. The Saracen also offered to go as Gama's messenger to the king,"
2243,THOMSON.,"and promised to procure him an able pilot to conduct him to Calicut, the"
2244,THOMSON.,chief port of India.
2245,THOMSON.,
2246,THOMSON.,"As the coast of Melinda appeared to be dangerous, Gama anchored at some"
2247,THOMSON.,"distance from the city, and, unwilling to risk the safety of any of his"
2248,THOMSON.,"men, he landed the Saracen on an island opposite to Melinda. This was"
2249,THOMSON.,"observed, and the stranger was brought before the king, to whom he gave"
2250,THOMSON.,"so favourable an account of the politeness and humanity of Gama, that a"
2251,THOMSON.,"present of several sheep, and fruits of all sorts, was sent by his"
2252,THOMSON.,"majesty to the admiral, who had the happiness to find the truth of what"
2253,THOMSON.,his prisoner had told him confirmed by the masters of the four ships
2254,THOMSON.,from India. These were Christians from Cambaya. They were transported
2255,THOMSON.,"with joy on the arrival of the Portuguese, and gave several useful"
2256,THOMSON.,instructions to the admiral.
2257,THOMSON.,
2258,THOMSON.,"The city of Melinda was situated in a fertile plain, surrounded with"
2259,THOMSON.,"gardens and groves of orange-trees, whose flowers diffused a most"
2260,THOMSON.,"grateful odour. The pastures were covered with herds; and the houses,"
2261,THOMSON.,"built of square stones, were both elegant and magnificent. Desirous to"
2262,THOMSON.,"make an alliance with such a state, Gama requited the civility of the"
2263,THOMSON.,"king with great generosity. He drew nearer the shore, and urged his"
2264,THOMSON.,instructions as apology for not landing to wait upon his majesty in
2265,THOMSON.,"person. The apology was accepted, and the king, whose age and infirmity"
2266,THOMSON.,"prevented him going on board, sent his son to congratulate Gama, and"
2267,THOMSON.,"enter into a treaty of friendship. The prince, who had some time"
2268,THOMSON.,"governed under the direction of his father, came in great pomp. His"
2269,THOMSON.,"dress was royally magnificent, the nobles who attended him displayed all"
2270,THOMSON.,"the riches of silk and embroidery, and the music of Melinda resounded"
2271,THOMSON.,"all over the bay. Gama, to express his regard, met him in the admiral's"
2272,THOMSON.,"barge. The prince, as soon as he came up, leaped into it, and"
2273,THOMSON.,"distinguishing the admiral by his habit, embraced him with all the"
2274,THOMSON.,"intimacy of old friendship. In their conversation, which was long and"
2275,THOMSON.,"sprightly, he discovered nothing of the barbarian, says Osorius, but in"
2276,THOMSON.,everything showed an intelligence and politeness worthy of his high
2277,THOMSON.,"rank. He accepted the fourteen Moors, whom Gama gave to him, with great"
2278,THOMSON.,"pleasure. He seemed to view Gama with enthusiasm, and confessed that"
2279,THOMSON.,"the build of the Portuguese ships, so much superior to what he had seen,"
2280,THOMSON.,convinced him of the greatness of that people. He gave Gama an able
2281,THOMSON.,"pilot, named Melemo Cana, to conduct him to Calicut; and requested, that"
2282,THOMSON.,"on his return to Europe, he would carry an ambassador with him to the"
2283,THOMSON.,"court of Lisbon. During the few days the fleet stayed at Melinda, the"
2284,THOMSON.,"mutual friendship increased, and a treaty of alliance was concluded. And"
2285,THOMSON.,"now, on April 22, resigning the helm to his skilful and honest pilot,"
2286,THOMSON.,Gama hoisted sail and steered to the north. In a few days they passed
2287,THOMSON.,"the line, and the Portuguese with ecstasy beheld the appearance of their"
2288,THOMSON.,"native sky. Orion, Ursa Major and Minor, and the other stars about the"
2289,THOMSON.,"north pole, were now a more joyful discovery than the south pole had"
2290,THOMSON.,"formerly been to them.[57] The pilot now stood out to the east, through"
2291,THOMSON.,"the Indian ocean; and after sailing about three weeks, he had the"
2292,THOMSON.,"happiness to congratulate Gama on the view of the mountains of Calicut,"
2293,THOMSON.,"who, transported with ecstasy, returned thanks to Heaven, and ordered"
2294,THOMSON.,all his prisoners to be set at liberty.
2295,THOMSON.,
2296,THOMSON.,"About two leagues from Calicut, Gama ordered the fleet to anchor, and"
2297,THOMSON.,was soon surrounded by a number of boats. By one of these he sent one of
2298,THOMSON.,the pardoned criminals to the city. The appearance of an unknown fleet
2299,THOMSON.,"on their coast brought immense crowds around the stranger, who no sooner"
2300,THOMSON.,"entered Calicut, than he was lifted from his feet and carried hither and"
2301,THOMSON.,thither by the concourse. Though the populace and the stranger were
2302,THOMSON.,"alike earnest to be understood, their language was unintelligible to"
2303,THOMSON.,"each other, till, happily for Gama, a Moorish merchant accosted his"
2304,THOMSON.,"messenger in the Spanish tongue. The next day this Moor, who was named"
2305,THOMSON.,"Monzaida, waited upon Gama on board his ship. He was a native of Tunis,"
2306,THOMSON.,"and the chief person, he said, with whom John II. had at that port"
2307,THOMSON.,contracted for military stores. He was a man of abilities and great
2308,THOMSON.,"intelligence of the world, and an admirer of the Portuguese valour and"
2309,THOMSON.,honour. The engaging behaviour of Gama heightened his esteem into the
2310,THOMSON.,sincerest attachment. Monzaida offered to be interpreter for the
2311,THOMSON.,"admiral, and to serve him in whatever besides he might possibly befriend"
2312,THOMSON.,"him. And thus, by one of those unforeseen circumstances which often"
2313,THOMSON.,"decide the greatest events, Gama obtained a friend who soon rendered him"
2314,THOMSON.,the most important services.
2315,THOMSON.,
2316,THOMSON.,"At the first interview, Monzaida gave Gama the fullest information of"
2317,THOMSON.,"the climate, extent, customs, religion, and riches of India, the"
2318,THOMSON.,"commerce of the Arabs, and the character of the sovereign. Calicut was"
2319,THOMSON.,"not only the imperial city, but the greatest port. The king, or"
2320,THOMSON.,"zamorim,[58] who resided here, was acknowledged as emperor by the"
2321,THOMSON.,"neighbouring princes; and, as his revenue consisted chiefly of duties on"
2322,THOMSON.,"merchandise, he had always encouraged the resort of foreigners to his"
2323,THOMSON.,ports.
2324,THOMSON.,
2325,THOMSON.,"Pleased with this promising prospect, Gama sent two of his officers with"
2326,THOMSON.,"Monzaida to wait upon the zamorim at his palace, at Pandarene, a few"
2327,THOMSON.,"miles from the city. They were admitted to the royal apartment, and"
2328,THOMSON.,"delivered their embassy; to which the zamorim replied, that the arrival"
2329,THOMSON.,"of the admiral of so great a prince as Emmanuel, gave him inexpressible"
2330,THOMSON.,"pleasure, and that he would willingly embrace the offered alliance. In"
2331,THOMSON.,"the meanwhile, as their present station was extremely dangerous, he"
2332,THOMSON.,"advised them to bring the ships nearer to Pandarene, and for this"
2333,THOMSON.,purpose he sent a pilot to the fleet.
2334,THOMSON.,
2335,THOMSON.,"A few days after this, the zamorim sent his first minister, or"
2336,THOMSON.,"catual,[59] attended by several of the nayres, or nobility, to conduct"
2337,THOMSON.,Gama to the royal palace. As an interview with the zamorim was
2338,THOMSON.,"absolutely necessary to complete the purpose of his voyage, Gama"
2339,THOMSON.,"immediately agreed to it, though the treachery he had already"
2340,THOMSON.,experienced since his arrival in the eastern seas showed him the
2341,THOMSON.,"personal danger which he thus hazarded. He gave his brother, Paulus, and"
2342,THOMSON.,Coello the command of the fleet in his absence.
2343,THOMSON.,
2344,THOMSON.,The revenue of the zamorim arose chiefly from the traffic of the Moors;
2345,THOMSON.,"the various colonies of these people were combined in one interest, and"
2346,THOMSON.,the jealousy and consternation which his arrival in the eastern seas had
2347,THOMSON.,"spread among them, were circumstances well known to Gama: and he knew,"
2348,THOMSON.,"also, what he had to expect, both from their force and their fraud. But"
2349,THOMSON.,duty and honour required him to complete the purpose of his voyage. He
2350,THOMSON.,"left peremptory command, that if he was detained a prisoner, or any"
2351,THOMSON.,"attempt made upon his life, they should take no step to save him or to"
2352,THOMSON.,reverse his fate; to give ear to no message which might come in his name
2353,THOMSON.,"for such purpose, and to enter into no negotiation on his behalf. They"
2354,THOMSON.,"were to keep some boats near the shore, to favour his escape if he"
2355,THOMSON.,perceived treachery before being detained by force; yet the moment that
2356,THOMSON.,"force rendered his escape impracticable they were to set sail, and carry"
2357,THOMSON.,"the tidings to the king. As this was his only concern, he would suffer"
2358,THOMSON.,"no risk that might lose a man, or endanger the homeward voyage. Having"
2359,THOMSON.,"left these orders, he went ashore with the catual, attended only by"
2360,THOMSON.,"twelve of his own men, for he would not weaken his fleet, though he knew"
2361,THOMSON.,the pomp of attendance would in one respect have been greatly in his
2362,THOMSON.,favour at the first court of India.
2363,THOMSON.,
2364,THOMSON.,"As soon as landed, he and the catual were carried in great pomp, in"
2365,THOMSON.,"palanquins, upon men's shoulders, to the chief temple, and thence, amid"
2366,THOMSON.,"immense crowds, to the royal palace. The apartment and dress of the"
2367,THOMSON.,zamorim were such as might be expected from the luxury and wealth of
2368,THOMSON.,"India. The emperor reclined on a magnificent couch, surrounded with his"
2369,THOMSON.,nobility and officers of state. Gama was introduced to him by a
2370,THOMSON.,"venerable old man, the chief brahmin. His majesty, by a gentle nod,"
2371,THOMSON.,"appointed the admiral to sit on one of the steps of his sofa, and then"
2372,THOMSON.,"demanded his embassy. It was against the custom of his country, Gama"
2373,THOMSON.,"replied, to deliver his instructions in a public assembly; he therefore"
2374,THOMSON.,desired that the king and a few of his ministers would grant him a
2375,THOMSON.,"private audience. This was complied with, and Gama, in a manly speech,"
2376,THOMSON.,"set forth the greatness of his sovereign Emmanuel, the fame he had heard"
2377,THOMSON.,"of the zamorim, and the desire he had to enter into an alliance with so"
2378,THOMSON.,great a prince; nor were the mutual advantages of such a treaty omitted
2379,THOMSON.,"by the admiral. The zamorim, in reply, professed great esteem for the"
2380,THOMSON.,"friendship of the King of Portugal, and declared his readiness to enter"
2381,THOMSON.,into a friendly alliance. He then ordered the catual to provide proper
2382,THOMSON.,apartments for Gama in his own house; and having promised another
2383,THOMSON.,"conference, he dismissed the admiral with all the appearance of"
2384,THOMSON.,sincerity.
2385,THOMSON.,
2386,THOMSON.,The character of this monarch is strongly marked in the history of
2387,THOMSON.,"Portuguese Asia. Avarice was his ruling passion; he was haughty or mean,"
2388,THOMSON.,"bold or timorous, as his interest rose or fell in the balance of his"
2389,THOMSON.,judgment; wavering and irresolute whenever the scales seemed doubtful
2390,THOMSON.,which to preponderate. He was pleased with the prospect of bringing the
2391,THOMSON.,"commerce of Europe to his harbours, but he was also influenced by the"
2392,THOMSON.,threats of the Moors.
2393,THOMSON.,
2394,THOMSON.,Three days elapsed ere Gama was again permitted to see the zamorim. At
2395,THOMSON.,this second audience he presented the letter and presents of Emmanuel.
2396,THOMSON.,"The letter was received with politeness, but the presents were viewed"
2397,THOMSON.,"with an eye of contempt. Gama noticed it, and said he only came to"
2398,THOMSON.,"discover the route to India, and therefore was not charged with valuable"
2399,THOMSON.,"gifts, before the friendship of the state, where they might choose to"
2400,THOMSON.,"traffic, was known. Yet, indeed, he brought the most valuable of all"
2401,THOMSON.,"gifts, the offer of the friendship of his sovereign, and the commerce of"
2402,THOMSON.,his country. He then entreated the king not to reveal the contents of
2403,THOMSON.,"Emmanuel's letter to the Moors; and the king, with great apparent"
2404,THOMSON.,"friendship, desired Gama to guard against the perfidy of that people. At"
2405,THOMSON.,"this time, it is highly probable, the zamorim was sincere."
2406,THOMSON.,
2407,THOMSON.,Every hour since the arrival of the fleet the Moors had held secret
2408,THOMSON.,conferences. That one man of it might not return was their purpose; and
2409,THOMSON.,every method to accomplish this was meditated. To influence the king
2410,THOMSON.,"against the Portuguese, to assassinate Gama, to raise a general"
2411,THOMSON.,"insurrection to destroy the foreign navy, and to bribe the catual, were"
2412,THOMSON.,determined. And the catual (the master of the house where Gama was
2413,THOMSON.,"lodged) accepted the bribe, and entered into their interest. Of all"
2414,THOMSON.,"these circumstances, however, Gama was apprised by his faithful"
2415,THOMSON.,"interpreter, Monzaida, whose affection to the foreign admiral the Moors"
2416,THOMSON.,"hitherto had not suspected. Thus informed, and having obtained the faith"
2417,THOMSON.,"of an alliance from the sovereign of the first port of India, Gama"
2418,THOMSON.,"resolved to elude the plots of the Moors; and accordingly, before the"
2419,THOMSON.,"dawn, he set out for Pandarene, in hope to get aboard his fleet by some"
2420,THOMSON.,of the boats which he had ordered to hover about the shore.
2421,THOMSON.,
2422,THOMSON.,"But the Moors were vigilant. His escape was immediately known, and the"
2423,THOMSON.,"catual, by the king's order, pursued and brought him back by force. The"
2424,THOMSON.,"catual, however (for it was necessary for their schemes to have the"
2425,THOMSON.,"ships in their power), behaved with politeness to the admiral, and"
2426,THOMSON.,promised to use all his interest in his behalf.
2427,THOMSON.,
2428,THOMSON.,The eagerness of the Moors now contributed to the safety of Gama. Their
2429,THOMSON.,"principal merchants were admitted to a formal audience, when one of"
2430,THOMSON.,their orators accused the Portuguese as a nation of faithless
2431,THOMSON.,"plunderers: Gama, he said, was an exiled pirate, who had marked his"
2432,THOMSON.,"course with blood and depredation. If he were not a pirate, still there"
2433,THOMSON.,was no excuse for giving such warlike foreigners any footing in a
2434,THOMSON.,country already supplied with all that nature and commerce could give.
2435,THOMSON.,He expatiated on the great services which the Moorish traders had
2436,THOMSON.,"rendered to Calicut; and ended with a threat, that all the Moors would"
2437,THOMSON.,"leave the zamorim's ports and find some other settlement, if he"
2438,THOMSON.,permitted these foreigners any share in the commerce of his dominions.
2439,THOMSON.,
2440,THOMSON.,"However staggered with these arguments and threats, the zamorim was not"
2441,THOMSON.,blind to the self-interest and malice of the Moors. He therefore
2442,THOMSON.,"ordered, that the admiral should once more be brought before him. In the"
2443,THOMSON.,meanwhile the catual tried many stratagems to get the fleet into the
2444,THOMSON.,"harbour; and at last, in the name of his master, made an absolute demand"
2445,THOMSON.,"that the sails and rudders should be delivered up, as the pledge of"
2446,THOMSON.,"Gama's honesty. But these demands were as absolutely refused by Gama,"
2447,THOMSON.,"who sent a letter to his brother by Monzaida, enforcing his former"
2448,THOMSON.,"orders in the strongest manner, declaring that his fate gave him no"
2449,THOMSON.,"concern, that he was only unhappy lest the fruits of all their fatigue"
2450,THOMSON.,and dangers should be lost. After two days spent in vain altercation
2451,THOMSON.,"with the catual, Gama was brought as a prisoner before the king. The"
2452,THOMSON.,king repeated his accusation; upbraided him with non-compliance to the
2453,THOMSON.,"requests of his minister; urged him, if he were an exile or a pirate, to"
2454,THOMSON.,"confess freely, in which case he promised to take him into his service,"
2455,THOMSON.,"and highly promote him on account of his abilities. But Gama, who with"
2456,THOMSON.,"great spirit had baffled all the stratagems of the catual, behaved with"
2457,THOMSON.,"the same undaunted bravery before the king. He asserted his innocence,"
2458,THOMSON.,"pointed out the malice of the Moors, and the improbability of his"
2459,THOMSON.,"piracy; boasted of the safety of his fleet, offered his life rather than"
2460,THOMSON.,"his sails and rudders, and concluded with threats in the name of his"
2461,THOMSON.,"sovereign. The zamorim, during the whole conference, eyed Gama with the"
2462,THOMSON.,"keenest attention, and clearly perceived in his unfaltering mien the"
2463,THOMSON.,"dignity of truth, and the consciousness that he was the admiral of a"
2464,THOMSON.,"great monarch. In their late address, the Moors had treated the zamorim"
2465,THOMSON.,"as somewhat dependent upon them, and he saw that a commerce with other"
2466,THOMSON.,nations would certainly lessen their dangerous importance. His avarice
2467,THOMSON.,strongly desired the commerce of Portugal; and his pride was flattered
2468,THOMSON.,"in humbling the Moors. After many proposals, it was at last agreed, that"
2469,THOMSON.,of his twelve attendants he should leave seven as hostages; that what
2470,THOMSON.,goods were aboard his fleet should be landed; and that Gama should be
2471,THOMSON.,"safely conducted to his ship, after which the treaty of commerce and"
2472,THOMSON.,"alliance was to be finally settled. And thus, when the assassination of"
2473,THOMSON.,"Gama seemed inevitable, the zamorim suddenly dropped his demand for the"
2474,THOMSON.,"sails and rudders, rescued him from his determined enemies, and restored"
2475,THOMSON.,him to liberty and the command of his navy.
2476,THOMSON.,
2477,THOMSON.,"As soon as he was aboard[60] the goods were landed, accompanied by a"
2478,THOMSON.,"letter from Gama to the zamorim, wherein he boldly complained of the"
2479,THOMSON.,"treachery of the catual. The zamorim, in answer, promised to make"
2480,THOMSON.,"inquiry, and punish him, if guilty; but did nothing in the affair. Gama,"
2481,THOMSON.,"who had now anchored nearer to the city, every day sent two or three"
2482,THOMSON.,"different persons on some business to Calicut, that as many of his men"
2483,THOMSON.,"as possible might be able to give some account of India. The Moors,"
2484,THOMSON.,"meanwhile, every day assaulted the ears of the king, who now began to"
2485,THOMSON.,"waver; when Gama, who had given every proof of his desire of peace and"
2486,THOMSON.,"friendship, sent another letter, in which he requested the zamorim to"
2487,THOMSON.,permit him to leave a consul at Calicut to manage the affairs of King
2488,THOMSON.,Emmanuel. But to this request--the most reasonable result of a
2489,THOMSON.,commercial treaty--the zamorim returned a refusal full of rage and
2490,THOMSON.,"indignation. Gama, now fully master of the character of the zamorim,"
2491,THOMSON.,"resolved to treat a man of such an inconstant, dishonourable disposition"
2492,THOMSON.,"with a contemptuous silence. This contempt was felt by the king, who,"
2493,THOMSON.,"yielding to the advice of the catual and the entreaties of the Moors,"
2494,THOMSON.,"seized the Portuguese goods, and ordered two of the seven hostages--the"
2495,THOMSON.,two who had the charge of the cargo--to be put in irons. The admiral
2496,THOMSON.,"remonstrated by means of Monzaida, but the king still persisted in his"
2497,THOMSON.,treacherous breach of faith. Repeated solicitations made him more
2498,THOMSON.,"haughty, and it was now the duty and interest of Gama to use force. He"
2499,THOMSON.,"took a vessel, in which were six nayres, or noblemen, and nineteen of"
2500,THOMSON.,"their servants. The servants he set ashore to relate the tidings, the"
2501,THOMSON.,noblemen he detained. As soon as the news had time to spread through the
2502,THOMSON.,"city, he hoisted his sails, and, though with a slow motion, seemed to"
2503,THOMSON.,proceed on his homeward voyage. The city was now in an uproar; the
2504,THOMSON.,"friends of the captive noblemen surrounded the palace, and loudly"
2505,THOMSON.,"accused the policy of the Moors. The king, in all the perplexed distress"
2506,THOMSON.,"of a haughty, avaricious, weak prince, sent after Gama, delivered up all"
2507,THOMSON.,"the hostages, and submitted to his proposals; nay, even solicited that"
2508,THOMSON.,"an agent should be left, and even descended to the meanness of a"
2509,THOMSON.,"palpable lie. The two factors, he said, he had put in irons, only to"
2510,THOMSON.,"detain them till he might write letters to his brother Emmanuel, and the"
2511,THOMSON.,goods he had kept on shore that an agent might be sent to dispose of
2512,THOMSON.,"them. Gama, however, perceived a mysterious trifling, and, previous to"
2513,THOMSON.,"any treaty, insisted upon the restoration of the goods."
2514,THOMSON.,
2515,THOMSON.,The day after this altercation Monzaida came aboard the fleet in great
2516,THOMSON.,"perturbation. The Moors, he said, had raised great commotions, and had"
2517,THOMSON.,enraged the king against the Portuguese. The king's ships were getting
2518,THOMSON.,"ready, and a numerous Moorish fleet from Mecca was daily expected. To"
2519,THOMSON.,delay Gama till this force arrived was the purpose of the Court and of
2520,THOMSON.,"the Moors, who were now confident of success. To this information"
2521,THOMSON.,"Monzaida added, that the Moors, suspecting his attachment to Gama, had"
2522,THOMSON.,determined to assassinate him; that he had narrowly escaped from them;
2523,THOMSON.,"that it was impossible for him to recover his effects, and that his only"
2524,THOMSON.,hope was in the protection of Gama. Gama rewarded him with the
2525,THOMSON.,"friendship he merited, took him with him, as he desired, to Lisbon, and"
2526,THOMSON.,procured him a recompense for his services.
2527,THOMSON.,
2528,THOMSON.,"Almost immediately seven boats arrived loaded with the goods, and"
2529,THOMSON.,demanded the restoration of the captive noblemen. Gama took the goods on
2530,THOMSON.,"board, but refused to examine if they were entire, and also refused to"
2531,THOMSON.,deliver the prisoners. He had been promised an ambassador to his
2532,THOMSON.,"sovereign, he said, but had been so often deluded he could trust such a"
2533,THOMSON.,"faithless people no longer, and would therefore carry away the captives"
2534,THOMSON.,to convince the King of Portugal what insults and injustice his
2535,THOMSON.,ambassador and admiral had suffered from the Zamorim of Calicut. Having
2536,THOMSON.,"thus dismissed the Indians, he fired his cannon and hoisted his sails. A"
2537,THOMSON.,"calm, however, detained him on the coast some days; and the zamorim,"
2538,THOMSON.,"seizing the opportunity, sent what vessels he could fit out (sixty in"
2539,THOMSON.,"all), full of armed men, to attack him. Though Gama's cannon were well"
2540,THOMSON.,"handled, confident of their numbers, they pressed on to board him, when"
2541,THOMSON.,"a sudden tempest arose, which Gama's ships rode out in safety, miserably"
2542,THOMSON.,"dispersed the Indian fleet, and completed their ruin."
2543,THOMSON.,
2544,THOMSON.,After this victory the admiral made a halt at a little island near the
2545,THOMSON.,"shore, where he erected a cross,[61] bearing the name and arms of his"
2546,THOMSON.,"Portuguese majesty. From this place, by the hand of Monzaida, he wrote a"
2547,THOMSON.,"letter to the zamorim, wherein he gave a full and circumstantial account"
2548,THOMSON.,"of all the plots of the catual and the Moors. Still, however, he"
2549,THOMSON.,"professed his desire of a commercial treaty, and promised to represent"
2550,THOMSON.,"the zamorim in the best light to Emmanuel. The prisoners, he said,"
2551,THOMSON.,"should be kindly used, were only kept as ambassadors to his sovereign,"
2552,THOMSON.,and should be returned to India when they were enabled from experience
2553,THOMSON.,to give an account of Portugal. The letter he sent by one of the
2554,THOMSON.,"captives, who by this means obtained his liberty."
2555,THOMSON.,
2556,THOMSON.,"The fame of Gama had now spread over the Indian seas, and the Moors were"
2557,THOMSON.,everywhere intent on his destruction. As he was near the shore of
2558,THOMSON.,"Anchediva, he beheld the appearance of a floating isle, covered with"
2559,THOMSON.,"trees, advance towards him. But his prudence was not to be thus"
2560,THOMSON.,"deceived. A bold pirate, named Timoja, by linking together eight vessels"
2561,THOMSON.,"full of men and covered with green boughs, thought to board him by"
2562,THOMSON.,"surprise. But Gama's cannon made seven of them fly; the eighth, loaded"
2563,THOMSON.,"with fruits and provision, he took. The beautiful island of Anchediva"
2564,THOMSON.,now offered a convenient place to careen his ships and refresh his men.
2565,THOMSON.,"While he stayed here, the first minister of Zabajo, king of Goa, one of"
2566,THOMSON.,"the most powerful princes of India, came on board, and, in the name of"
2567,THOMSON.,"his master, congratulated the admiral in the Italian tongue. Provisions,"
2568,THOMSON.,"arms, and money were offered to Gama, and he was entreated to accept the"
2569,THOMSON.,friendship of Zabajo. The admiral was struck with admiration; the
2570,THOMSON.,address and abilities of the minister appeared so conspicuous. He said
2571,THOMSON.,"he was an Italian by birth, but in sailing to Greece, had been taken by"
2572,THOMSON.,"pirates, and after various misfortunes, had been necessitated to enter"
2573,THOMSON.,"into the service of a Mohammedan prince, the nobleness of whose"
2574,THOMSON.,"disposition he commended in the highest terms. Yet, with all his"
2575,THOMSON.,"abilities, Gama perceived an artful inquisitiveness--that nameless"
2576,THOMSON.,something which does not accompany simple honesty. After a long
2577,THOMSON.,"conference, Gama abruptly upbraided him as a spy, and ordered him to be"
2578,THOMSON.,"put to the torture. And this soon brought a confession, that he was a"
2579,THOMSON.,"Polish Jew by birth, and was sent to examine the strength of the fleet"
2580,THOMSON.,"by Zabajo, who was mustering all his power to attack the Portuguese."
2581,THOMSON.,"Gama, on this, immediately set sail, and took the spy along with him,"
2582,THOMSON.,"who soon after was baptized, and named Jasper de Gama, the admiral being"
2583,THOMSON.,his godfather. He afterwards became of great service to Emmanuel.
2584,THOMSON.,
2585,THOMSON.,"Gama now stood westward through the Indian Ocean, and after being long"
2586,THOMSON.,"delayed by calms, arrived off Magadoxa, on the coast of Africa. This"
2587,THOMSON.,place was a principal port of the Moors; he therefore levelled the walls
2588,THOMSON.,"of the city with his cannon, and burned and destroyed all the ships in"
2589,THOMSON.,the harbour. Soon after this he descried eight Moorish vessels bearing
2590,THOMSON.,"down upon him; his artillery, however, soon made them use their oars in"
2591,THOMSON.,"flight, nor could Gama overtake any of them for want of wind. The"
2592,THOMSON.,"hospitable harbour of Melinda was the next place he reached. His men,"
2593,THOMSON.,"almost worn out with fatigue and sickness, here received a second time"
2594,THOMSON.,every assistance which an accomplished and generous prince could bestow.
2595,THOMSON.,"And having taken an ambassador on board, he again set sail, in hope that"
2596,THOMSON.,he might pass the Cape of Good Hope while the favourable weather
2597,THOMSON.,continued; for his acquaintance with the eastern seas now suggested to
2598,THOMSON.,him that the tempestuous season was periodical. Soon after he set sail
2599,THOMSON.,"his brother's ship struck on a sand bank, and was burnt by order of the"
2600,THOMSON.,"admiral. His brother and part of the crew he took into his own ship, the"
2601,THOMSON.,rest he sent on board of Coello's; nor were more hands now alive than
2602,THOMSON.,were necessary to man the two vessels which remained. Having taken in
2603,THOMSON.,provisions at the island of Zanzibar (where they were kindly entertained
2604,THOMSON.,"by a Mohammedan prince of the same sect with the King of Melinda), they"
2605,THOMSON.,"safely doubled the Cape of Good Hope on April 26, 1499, and continued"
2606,THOMSON.,"till they reached the island of St. Iago, in favourable weather. But a"
2607,THOMSON.,"tempest here separated the two ships, and gave Gama and Coello an"
2608,THOMSON.,opportunity to show the goodness of their hearts in a manner which does
2609,THOMSON.,honour to human nature.
2610,THOMSON.,
2611,THOMSON.,"The admiral was now near the Azores, when Paulus de Gama, long worn with"
2612,THOMSON.,"fatigue and sickness, was unable to endure the motion of the ship."
2613,THOMSON.,"Vasco, therefore, put into the island of Tercera, in hope of his"
2614,THOMSON.,"brother's recovery. And such was his affection, that rather than leave"
2615,THOMSON.,him he gave the command of his ship to one of his officers. But the hope
2616,THOMSON.,"of recovery was vain. John de Sa proceeded to Lisbon with the flag ship,"
2617,THOMSON.,"while the admiral remained behind to soothe the deathbed of his brother,"
2618,THOMSON.,"and perform his funeral rites. Coello, meanwhile, landed at Lisbon, and"
2619,THOMSON.,"hearing that Gama had not arrived, imagined he might either be"
2620,THOMSON.,shipwrecked or beating about in distress. Without seeing one of his
2621,THOMSON.,"family he immediately set sail again, on purpose to bring relief to his"
2622,THOMSON.,friend and admiral. But this generous design was prevented by an order
2623,THOMSON.,"from the king, ere he got out of the Tagus."
2624,THOMSON.,
2625,THOMSON.,"The particulars of the voyage were now diffused by Coello, and the joy"
2626,THOMSON.,"of the king was only equalled by the admiration of the people. Yet,"
2627,THOMSON.,while all the nation was fired with zeal to express their esteem of the
2628,THOMSON.,"happy admiral, he himself, the man who was such an enthusiast to the"
2629,THOMSON.,success of his voyage that he would willingly have sacrificed his life
2630,THOMSON.,"in India to secure that success, was now in the completion of it a"
2631,THOMSON.,"dejected mourner. The compliments of the Court, and the shouts of the"
2632,THOMSON.,"street, were irksome to him; for his brother, the companion of his toils"
2633,THOMSON.,"and dangers, was not there to share the joy. As soon as he had waited on"
2634,THOMSON.,"the king, he shut himself up in a lonely house near the seaside at"
2635,THOMSON.,"Belem, from whence it was some time ere he was drawn to mingle in public"
2636,THOMSON.,life.
2637,THOMSON.,
2638,THOMSON.,"During this important expedition, two years and almost two months"
2639,THOMSON.,"elapsed. Of 160 men who went out, only 55 returned. These were all"
2640,THOMSON.,"rewarded by the king. Coello was pensioned with 100 ducats a year, and"
2641,THOMSON.,"made a fidalgo, or gentleman of the king's household, a degree of"
2642,THOMSON.,nobility in Portugal. The title of Don was annexed to the family of
2643,THOMSON.,"Vasco de Gama. He was appointed admiral of the eastern seas, with an"
2644,THOMSON.,"annual salary of 3000 ducats, and a part of the king's arms was added to"
2645,THOMSON.,his. Public thanksgivings to Heaven were celebrated throughout the
2646,THOMSON.,"churches of the kingdom; while feasts, dramatic performances, and"
2647,THOMSON.,"chivalrous entertainments (or tournaments), according to the taste of"
2648,THOMSON.,"that age, demonstrated the joy of Portugal."
2649,THOMSON.,
2650,THOMSON.,Pedro Alvarez Cabral was the second Portuguese admiral who sailed for
2651,THOMSON.,"India. He entered into alliance with Trimumpara, king of Cochin, and"
2652,THOMSON.,high priest of Malabar. (See Bk. x. p. 302.)
2653,THOMSON.,
2654,THOMSON.,"Gama, having left six ships for the protection of Cochin and Cananor,"
2655,THOMSON.,"had sailed for Portugal with twelve ships, laden with the riches of the"
2656,THOMSON.,"East. As soon as his departure was made known, the zamorim made great"
2657,THOMSON.,"preparations to attack Cochin--a city situated on an island, divided by"
2658,THOMSON.,"an arm of the sea from the main-land. At one part, however, this creek"
2659,THOMSON.,"was fordable at low water. The zamorim having renewed the war, at"
2660,THOMSON.,"length, by force of numbers and bribery, took the city; and the King of"
2661,THOMSON.,"Cochin, stripped of his dominions, but still faithful to the Portuguese,"
2662,THOMSON.,"fled to the island of Viopia. Francisco Albuquerque, with other"
2663,THOMSON.,"commanders, having heard of the fate of Cochin, set sail for its relief;"
2664,THOMSON.,"the garrison of the zamorim fled, and Trimumpara was restored to his"
2665,THOMSON.,throne. Every precaution by which the passage to the island of Cochin
2666,THOMSON.,might be secured was now taken by Pacheco. The Portuguese took the
2667,THOMSON.,"sacrament, and devoted themselves to death. The King of Cochin's troops"
2668,THOMSON.,"amounted only to 5000 men, while the army of the zamorim numbered"
2669,THOMSON.,"57,000, provided with brass cannon, and assisted by two Italian"
2670,THOMSON.,"engineers. Yet this immense army, laying siege to Cochin, was defeated."
2671,THOMSON.,Seven times the zamorim raised new armies; yet they were all vanquished
2672,THOMSON.,"at the fords of Cochin, by the intrepidity and stratagems of Pacheco. In"
2673,THOMSON.,"the later battles the zamorim exposed himself to the greatest danger,"
2674,THOMSON.,and was sometimes sprinkled with the blood of his slain attendants--a
2675,THOMSON.,"circumstance mentioned in the Lusiad, bk. x. p. 304. He then had"
2676,THOMSON.,recourse to fraud and poison; but all his attempts were baffled. At
2677,THOMSON.,"last, in despair, he resigned his throne, and shut himself up for the"
2678,THOMSON.,rest of his days in one of the temples.
2679,THOMSON.,
2680,THOMSON.,Soon after the kingdom of Cochin was restored to prosperity Pacheco was
2681,THOMSON.,recalled. The King of Portugal paid the highest compliments to his
2682,THOMSON.,"valour, and gave him the government of a possession of the crown in"
2683,THOMSON.,Africa. But merit always has enemies: Pacheco was accused and brought to
2684,THOMSON.,"Lisbon in irons, where he remained for a considerable time chained in a"
2685,THOMSON.,"dungeon. He was at length tried, and after a full investigation of the"
2686,THOMSON.,"charges made against him, was honourably acquitted. His services to his"
2687,THOMSON.,"country were soon forgotten, his merits were no longer thought of, and"
2688,THOMSON.,the unfortunate Pacheco ended his days in an alms-house--a circumstance
2689,THOMSON.,"referred to in the Lusiad, bk. x. p. 305."

3177,ARGUMENT.,"So spoke high Jove: the gods in silence heard,"
3178,ARGUMENT.,"Then rising, each by turns his thoughts preferr'd:"

3185,ARGUMENT.,The fertile vales beneath the rising sun
3186,ARGUMENT.,"He view'd as his, by right of victory won,"

3189,ARGUMENT.,"Yet Fate, he knew, had will'd, that loos'd from Spain"
3190,ARGUMENT.,"Boldly advent'rous thro' the polar main,"
3191,ARGUMENT.,"A warlike race should come, renown'd in arms,"

3195,ARGUMENT.,
3196,ARGUMENT.,"Urania-Venus,[82] queen of sacred love,"
3197,ARGUMENT.,Arose and fixed her asking eyes on Jove;

3208,ARGUMENT.,And barb'rous nations at her holy shrine
3209,ARGUMENT.,Be humaniz'd and taught her lore divine.
3210,ARGUMENT.,"Her spreading honours thus the one inspir'd,"
3211,ARGUMENT.,And one the dread to lose his worship fir'd.
3212,ARGUMENT.,Their struggling factions shook th' Olympian state
3213,ARGUMENT.,With all the clam'rous tempest of debate.
3214,ARGUMENT.,"Thus, when the storm with sudden gust invades"

3223,ARGUMENT.,"And now, before the throne of Jove advanc'd,"
3224,ARGUMENT.,"O'er his left shoulder his broad shield he throws,"
3225,ARGUMENT.,And lifts his helm[85] above his dreadful brows:
3226,ARGUMENT.,"Bold and enrag'd he stands, and, frowning round,"
3227,ARGUMENT.,Strikes his tall spear-staff on the sounding ground;
3228,ARGUMENT.,"Heav'n trembled, and the light turn'd pale[86]--such dread"
3229,ARGUMENT.,His fierce demeanour o'er Olympus spread--
3230,ARGUMENT.,"When thus the warrior: ""O Eternal Sire,"
3231,ARGUMENT.,"Thine is the sceptre, thine the thunder's fire,"
3232,ARGUMENT.,"Supreme dominion thine; then, Father, hear,"
3233,ARGUMENT.,"Shall that bold race which once to thee was dear,"

3269,ARGUMENT.,"Behind them now the Cape of Praso[89] bends,"
3270,ARGUMENT.,"Another ocean to their view extends,"
3271,ARGUMENT.,"Where black-topp'd islands, to their longing eyes,"
3272,ARGUMENT.,"Lav'd by the gentle waves,[90] in prospect rise."
3273,ARGUMENT.,"But GAMA (captain of the vent'rous band,"
3274,ARGUMENT.,"Of bold emprize, and born for high command,"
3275,ARGUMENT.,"Whose martial fires, with prudence close allied,"
3276,ARGUMENT.,Ensur'd the smiles of fortune on his side)
3277,ARGUMENT.,"Bears off those shores which waste and wild appear'd,"
3278,ARGUMENT.,And eastward still for happier climates steer'd:
3279,ARGUMENT.,"When gath'ring round, and black'ning o'er the tide,"
3280,ARGUMENT.,A fleet of small canoes the pilot spied;
3281,ARGUMENT.,"Hoisting their sails of palm-tree leaves, inwove"
3282,ARGUMENT.,"With curious art, a swarming crowd they move:"
3283,ARGUMENT.,"Long were their boats, and sharp to bound along"
3284,ARGUMENT.,"Through the dash'd waters, broad their oars and strong:"
3285,ARGUMENT.,The bending rowers on their features bore
3286,ARGUMENT.,The swarthy marks of Phaeton's[91] fall of yore:
3287,ARGUMENT.,"When flaming lightnings scorch'd the banks of Po,"
3288,ARGUMENT.,And nations blacken'd in the dread o'erthrow.
3289,ARGUMENT.,"Their garb, discover'd as approaching nigh,"
3290,ARGUMENT.,Was cotton strip'd with many a gaudy dye:
3291,ARGUMENT.,"'Twas one whole piece beneath one arm confin'd,"
3292,ARGUMENT.,The rest hung loose and flutter'd on the wind;
3293,ARGUMENT.,"All, but one breast, above the loins was bare,"
3294,ARGUMENT.,And swelling turbans bound their jetty hair:
3295,ARGUMENT.,"Their arms were bearded darts and faulchions broad,"
3296,ARGUMENT.,And warlike music sounded as they row'd.
3297,ARGUMENT.,"With joy the sailors saw the boats draw near,"
3298,ARGUMENT.,With joy beheld the human face appear:
3299,ARGUMENT.,"What nations these, their wond'ring thoughts explore,"
3300,ARGUMENT.,"What rites they follow, and what God adore!"
3301,ARGUMENT.,And now with hands and 'kerchiefs wav'd in air
3302,ARGUMENT.,The barb'rous race their friendly mind declare.
3303,ARGUMENT.,"Glad were the crew, and ween'd that happy day"
3304,ARGUMENT.,Should end their dangers and their toils repay.
3305,ARGUMENT.,"The lofty masts the nimble youths ascend,"
3306,ARGUMENT.,"The ropes they haul, and o'er the yard-arms bend;"
3307,ARGUMENT.,"And now their bowsprits pointing to the shore,"
3308,ARGUMENT.,"(A safe moon'd bay), with slacken'd sails they bore:"
3309,ARGUMENT.,With cheerful shouts they furl the gather'd sail
3310,ARGUMENT.,That less and less flaps quiv'ring on the gale;
3311,ARGUMENT.,"The prows, their speed stopp'd, o'er the surges nod,"
3312,ARGUMENT.,The falling anchors dash the foaming flood;
3313,ARGUMENT.,"When, sudden as they stopp'd, the swarthy race,"
3314,ARGUMENT.,"With smiles of friendly welcome on each face,"
3315,ARGUMENT.,The ship's high sides swift by the cordage climb:
3316,ARGUMENT.,"Illustrious GAMA, with an air sublime,"
3317,ARGUMENT.,"Soften'd by mild humanity, receives,"
3318,ARGUMENT.,"And to their chief the hand of friendship gives,"
3319,ARGUMENT.,"Bids spread the board, and, instant as he said,"
3320,ARGUMENT.,Along the deck the festive board is spread:
3321,ARGUMENT.,"The sparkling wine in crystal goblets glows,"
3322,ARGUMENT.,And round and round with cheerful welcome flows.
3323,ARGUMENT.,"While thus the vine its sprightly glee inspires,"
3324,ARGUMENT.,"From whence the fleet, the swarthy chief enquires,"
3325,ARGUMENT.,"What seas they past, what 'vantage would attain,"
3326,ARGUMENT.,And what the shore their purpose hop'd to gain?
3327,ARGUMENT.,"""From farthest west,"" the Lusian race reply,"
3328,ARGUMENT.,"""To reach the golden Eastern shores we try."
3329,ARGUMENT.,Through that unbounded sea whose billows roll
3330,ARGUMENT.,From the cold northern to the southern pole;
3331,ARGUMENT.,"And by the wide extent, the dreary vast"
3332,ARGUMENT.,"Of Afric's bays, already have we past;"
3333,ARGUMENT.,"And many a sky have seen, and many a shore,"
3334,ARGUMENT.,Where but sea monsters cut the waves before.
3335,ARGUMENT.,"To spread the glories of our monarch's reign,"
3336,ARGUMENT.,"For India's shore we brave the trackless main,"
3337,ARGUMENT.,"Our glorious toil, and at his nod would brave"
3338,ARGUMENT.,The dismal gulfs of Acheron's[92] black wave.
3339,ARGUMENT.,"And now, in turn, your race, your country tell,"
3340,ARGUMENT.,If on your lips fair truth delights to dwell
3341,ARGUMENT.,"To us, unconscious of the falsehood, show"
3342,ARGUMENT.,"What of these seas and India's site you know."""
3343,ARGUMENT.,
3344,ARGUMENT.,"""Rude are the natives here,"" the Moor replied;"
3345,ARGUMENT.,"""Dark are their minds, and brute-desire their guide:"
3346,ARGUMENT.,"But we, of alien blood, and strangers here,"
3347,ARGUMENT.,Nor hold their customs nor their laws revere.
3348,ARGUMENT.,"From Abram's race our holy prophet sprung,[93]"
3349,ARGUMENT.,"An angel taught, and heaven inspir'd his tongue;"
3350,ARGUMENT.,"His sacred rites and mandates we obey,"
3351,ARGUMENT.,And distant empires own his holy sway.
3352,ARGUMENT.,"From isle to isle our trading vessels roam,"
3353,ARGUMENT.,Mozambique's harbour our commodious home.
3354,ARGUMENT.,"If then your sails for India's shore expand,"
3355,ARGUMENT.,"For sultry Ganges or Hydaspes'[94] strand,"
3356,ARGUMENT.,Here shall you find a pilot skill'd to guide
3357,ARGUMENT.,"Through all the dangers of the perilous tide,"
3358,ARGUMENT.,"Though wide-spread shelves, and cruel rocks unseen,"
3359,ARGUMENT.,"Lurk in the way, and whirlpools rage between."
3360,ARGUMENT.,"Accept, meanwhile, what fruits these islands hold,"
3361,ARGUMENT.,And to the regent let your wish be told.
3362,ARGUMENT.,"Then may your mates the needful stores provide,"
3363,ARGUMENT.,"And all your various wants be here supplied."""
3364,ARGUMENT.,
3365,ARGUMENT.,"So spake the Moor, and bearing smiles untrue"
3366,ARGUMENT.,"And signs of friendship, with his bands withdrew."
3367,ARGUMENT.,"O'erpower'd with joy unhop'd the sailors stood,"
3368,ARGUMENT.,To find such kindness on a shore so rude.
3369,ARGUMENT.,
3370,ARGUMENT.,"Now shooting o'er the flood his fervid blaze,"
3371,ARGUMENT.,The red-brow'd sun withdraws his beamy rays;
3372,ARGUMENT.,"Safe in the bay the crew forget their cares,"
3373,ARGUMENT.,And peaceful rest their wearied strength repairs.
3374,ARGUMENT.,"Calm twilight now[95] his drowsy mantle spreads,"
3375,ARGUMENT.,"And shade on shade, the gloom still deep'ning, sheds."
3376,ARGUMENT.,"The moon, full orb'd, forsakes her wat'ry cave,"
3377,ARGUMENT.,And lifts her lovely head above the wave.
3378,ARGUMENT.,The snowy splendours of her modest ray
3379,ARGUMENT.,"Stream o'er the glist'ning waves, and quiv'ring play:"
3380,ARGUMENT.,"Around her, glitt'ring on the heaven's arch'd brow,"
3381,ARGUMENT.,"Unnumber'd stars, enclos'd in azure, glow,"
3382,ARGUMENT.,"Thick as the dew-drops of the April dawn,"
3383,ARGUMENT.,Or May-flowers crowding o'er the daisy-lawn:
3384,ARGUMENT.,"The canvas whitens in the silvery beam,"
3385,ARGUMENT.,And with a mild pale red the pendants gleam:
3386,ARGUMENT.,The masts' tall shadows tremble o'er the deep;
3387,ARGUMENT.,The peaceful winds a holy silence keep;
3388,ARGUMENT.,"The watchman's carol, echo'd from the prows,"
3389,ARGUMENT.,"Alone, at times, awakes the still repose."
3390,ARGUMENT.,
3391,ARGUMENT.,"Aurora now, with dewy lustre bright,"
3392,ARGUMENT.,"Appears, ascending on the rear of night."
3393,ARGUMENT.,"With gentle hand, as seeming oft to pause,"
3394,ARGUMENT.,The purple curtains of the morn she draws;
3395,ARGUMENT.,"The sun comes forth, and soon the joyful crew,"
3396,ARGUMENT.,"Each aiding each, their joyful tasks pursue."
3397,ARGUMENT.,Wide o'er the decks the spreading sails they throw;
3398,ARGUMENT.,From each tall mast the waving streamers flow;
3399,ARGUMENT.,All seems a festive holiday on board
3400,ARGUMENT.,To welcome to the fleet the island's lord.
3401,ARGUMENT.,"With equal joy the regent sails to meet,"
3402,ARGUMENT.,"And brings fresh cates, his off'rings, to the fleet:"
3403,ARGUMENT.,"For of his kindred race their line he deems,"
3404,ARGUMENT.,"That savage race[96] who rush'd from Caspia's streams,"
3405,ARGUMENT.,"And triumph'd o'er the East, and, Asia won,"
3406,ARGUMENT.,In proud Byzantium[97] fix'd their haughty throne.
3407,ARGUMENT.,"Brave VASCO hails the chief with honest smiles,"
3408,ARGUMENT.,And gift for gift with liberal hand he piles.
3409,ARGUMENT.,"His gifts, the boast of Europe's heart disclose,"
3410,ARGUMENT.,And sparkling red the wine of Tagus flows.
3411,ARGUMENT.,"High on the shrouds the wond'ring sailors hung,"
3412,ARGUMENT.,"To note the Moorish garb, and barb'rous tongue:"
3413,ARGUMENT.,"Nor less the subtle Moor, with wonder fir'd,"
3414,ARGUMENT.,"Their mien, their dress, and lordly ships admir'd:"
3415,ARGUMENT.,"Much he enquires their king's, their country's name,"
3416,ARGUMENT.,"And, if from Turkey's fertile shores they came?"
3417,ARGUMENT.,"What God they worshipp'd, what their sacred lore,"
3418,ARGUMENT.,"What arms they wielded, and what armour wore?"
3419,ARGUMENT.,"To whom brave GAMA: ""Nor of Hagar's blood"
3420,ARGUMENT.,"Am I, nor plough from Ismael's shores the flood;"
3421,ARGUMENT.,"From Europe's strand I trace the foamy way,"
3422,ARGUMENT.,To find the regions of the infant day.
3423,ARGUMENT.,"The God we worship stretch'd yon heaven's high bow,"
3424,ARGUMENT.,And gave these swelling waves to roll below;
3425,ARGUMENT.,"The hemispheres of night and day He spread,"
3426,ARGUMENT.,"He scoop'd each vale, and rear'd each mountain's head;"
3427,ARGUMENT.,"His Word produc'd the nations of the earth,"
3428,ARGUMENT.,And gave the spirits of the sky their birth;
3429,ARGUMENT.,"On earth, by Him, his holy lore was given,"
3430,ARGUMENT.,On earth He came to raise mankind to heaven.
3431,ARGUMENT.,"And now behold, what most your eyes desire,"
3432,ARGUMENT.,"Our shining armour, and our arms of fire;"
3433,ARGUMENT.,"For who has once in friendly peace beheld,"
3434,ARGUMENT.,"Will dread to meet them on the battle field."""
3435,ARGUMENT.,
3436,ARGUMENT.,Straight as he spoke[98] the warlike stores display'd
3437,ARGUMENT.,"Their glorious show, where, tire on tire inlaid,"
3438,ARGUMENT.,"Appear'd of glitt'ring steel the carabines,"
3439,ARGUMENT.,"There the plum'd helms,[99] and pond'rous brigandines;[100]"
3440,ARGUMENT.,O'er the broad bucklers sculptur'd orbs emboss'd
3441,ARGUMENT.,"The crooked faulchions, dreadful blades were cross'd:"
3442,ARGUMENT.,"Here clasping greaves, and plated mail-quilts strong;"
3443,ARGUMENT.,"The long-bows here, and rattling quivers hung,"
3444,ARGUMENT.,"And like a grove the burnish'd spears were seen,"
3445,ARGUMENT.,With darts and halberts double-edged between;
3446,ARGUMENT.,"Here dread grenadoes and tremendous bombs,"
3447,ARGUMENT.,"With deaths ten thousand lurking in their wombs,"
3448,ARGUMENT.,"And far around, of brown and dusky red,"
3449,ARGUMENT.,The pointed piles of iron balls were spread.
3450,ARGUMENT.,"The bombardiers, now to the regent's view"
3451,ARGUMENT.,The thund'ring mortars and the cannon drew;
3452,ARGUMENT.,"Yet, at their leader's nod, the sons of flame"
3453,ARGUMENT.,(For brave and gen'rous ever are the same)
3454,ARGUMENT.,"Withheld their hands, nor gave the seeds of fire"
3455,ARGUMENT.,To rouse the thunders of the dreadful tire.
3456,ARGUMENT.,For GAMA'S soul disdain'd the pride of show
3457,ARGUMENT.,Which acts the lion o'er the trembling roe.
3458,ARGUMENT.,
3459,ARGUMENT.,"His joy and wonder oft the Moor express'd,"
3460,ARGUMENT.,But rankling hate lay brooding in his breast;
3461,ARGUMENT.,"With smiles obedient to his will's control,"
3462,ARGUMENT.,He veils the purpose of his treach'rous soul:
3463,ARGUMENT.,"For pilots, conscious of the Indian strand,"
3464,ARGUMENT.,"Brave VASCO sues, and bids the Moor command"
3465,ARGUMENT.,What bounteous gifts shall recompense their toils;
3466,ARGUMENT.,"The Moor prevents him with assenting smiles,"
3467,ARGUMENT.,"Resolved that deeds of death, not words of air,"
3468,ARGUMENT.,Shall first the hatred of his soul declare;
3469,ARGUMENT.,"Such sudden rage his rankling mind possess'd,"
3470,ARGUMENT.,When GAMA'S lips Messiah's name confess'd.[101]
3471,ARGUMENT.,"Oh depth of Heaven's dread will, that ranc'rous hate"
3472,ARGUMENT.,On Heaven's best lov'd in ev'ry clime should wait!
3473,ARGUMENT.,"Now, smiling round on all the wond'ring crew"
3474,ARGUMENT.,"The Moor, attended by his bands, withdrew;"
3475,ARGUMENT.,"His nimble barges soon approach'd the land,"
3476,ARGUMENT.,And shouts of joy receiv'd him on the strand.
3477,ARGUMENT.,
3478,ARGUMENT.,From heaven's high dome the vintage-god[102] beheld
3479,ARGUMENT.,(Whom nine long months his father's thigh conceal'd);[103]
3480,ARGUMENT.,Well pleas'd he mark'd the Moor's determin'd hate
3481,ARGUMENT.,And thus his mind revolv'd in self-debate:--
3482,ARGUMENT.,
3483,ARGUMENT.,"""Has Heaven, indeed, such glorious lot ordain'd,"
3484,ARGUMENT.,By Lusus' race such conquests to be gain'd
3485,ARGUMENT.,"O'er warlike nations, and on India's shore,"
3486,ARGUMENT.,"Where I, unrivall'd, claim'd the palm before?"
3487,ARGUMENT.,"I, sprung from Jove! And shall these wand'ring few,"
3488,ARGUMENT.,"What Ammon's son[104] unconquer'd left, subdue"
3489,ARGUMENT.,Ammon's brave son who led the god of war
3490,ARGUMENT.,His slave auxiliar at his thund'ring car?
3491,ARGUMENT.,"Must these possess what Jove to him denied,"
3492,ARGUMENT.,Possess what never sooth'd the Roman pride?
3493,ARGUMENT.,Must these the victor's lordly flag display
3494,ARGUMENT.,"With hateful blaze beneath the rising day,"
3495,ARGUMENT.,"My name dishonour'd, and my victories stain'd,"
3496,ARGUMENT.,"O'erturn'd my altars, and my shrines profan'd?"
3497,ARGUMENT.,No; be it mine to fan the Regent's hate;
3498,ARGUMENT.,Occasion seiz'd commands the action's fate.
3499,ARGUMENT.,"'Tis mine--this captain, now my dread no more,"
3500,ARGUMENT.,"Shall never shake his spear on India's shore."""
3501,ARGUMENT.,
3502,ARGUMENT.,"So spake the Power,[105] and with the lightning's flight"
3503,ARGUMENT.,For Afric darted thro' the fields of light.
3504,ARGUMENT.,"His form divine he cloth'd in human shape,[106]"
3505,ARGUMENT.,And rush'd impetuous o'er the rocky cape:
3506,ARGUMENT.,In the dark semblance of a Moor he came
3507,ARGUMENT.,For art and old experience known to fame:
3508,ARGUMENT.,"Him all his peers with humble deference heard,"
3509,ARGUMENT.,And all Mozambique and its prince rever'd:
3510,ARGUMENT.,"The prince in haste he sought, and thus express'd"
3511,ARGUMENT.,His guileful hate in friendly counsel dress'd:
3512,ARGUMENT.,
3513,ARGUMENT.,"""And to the regent of this isle alone"
3514,ARGUMENT.,Are these adventurers and their fraud unknown?
3515,ARGUMENT.,Has Fame conceal'd their rapine from his ear?
3516,ARGUMENT.,Nor brought the groans of plunder'd nations here?
3517,ARGUMENT.,Yet still their hands the peaceful olive bore
3518,ARGUMENT.,Whene'er they anchor'd on a foreign shore:
3519,ARGUMENT.,"But nor their seeming nor their oaths I trust,"
3520,ARGUMENT.,For Afric knows them bloody and unjust.
3521,ARGUMENT.,"The nations sink beneath their lawless force,"
3522,ARGUMENT.,And fire and blood have mark'd their deadly course.
3523,ARGUMENT.,"We too, unless kind Heav'n and thou prevent,"
3524,ARGUMENT.,"Must fall the victims of their dire intent,"
3525,ARGUMENT.,"And, gasping in the pangs of death, behold"
3526,ARGUMENT.,"Our wives led captive, and our daughters sold."
3527,ARGUMENT.,"By stealth they come, ere morrow dawn, to bring"
3528,ARGUMENT.,The healthful bev'rage from the living spring:
3529,ARGUMENT.,Arm'd with his troops the captain will appear;
3530,ARGUMENT.,For conscious fraud is ever prone to fear.
3531,ARGUMENT.,"To meet them there select a trusty band,"
3532,ARGUMENT.,"And, in close ambush, take thy silent stand;"
3533,ARGUMENT.,"There wait, and sudden on the heedless foe"
3534,ARGUMENT.,"Rush, and destroy them ere they dread the blow."
3535,ARGUMENT.,"Or say, should some escape the secret snare,"
3536,ARGUMENT.,"Saved by their fate, their valour, or their care,"
3537,ARGUMENT.,"Yet their dread fall shall celebrate our isle,"
3538,ARGUMENT.,"If Fate consent, and thou approve the guile."
3539,ARGUMENT.,"Give then a pilot to their wand'ring fleet,"
3540,ARGUMENT.,"Bold in his art, and tutor'd in deceit;"
3541,ARGUMENT.,"Whose hand advent'rous shall their helms misguide,"
3542,ARGUMENT.,"To hostile shores, or whelm them in the tide."""
3543,ARGUMENT.,
3544,ARGUMENT.,"So spoke the god, in semblance of a sage"
3545,ARGUMENT.,Renown'd for counsel and the craft of age.
3546,ARGUMENT.,The prince with transport glowing in his face
3547,ARGUMENT.,"Approv'd, and caught him in a kind embrace:"
3548,ARGUMENT.,And instant at the word his bands prepare
3549,ARGUMENT.,"Their bearded darts and implements of war,"
3550,ARGUMENT.,That Lusus' sons might purple with their gore
3551,ARGUMENT.,The crystal fountain which they sought on shore:
3552,ARGUMENT.,"And, still regardful of his dire intent,"
3553,ARGUMENT.,"A skilful pilot to the bay he sent,"
3554,ARGUMENT.,"Of honest mien, yet practised in deceit,"
3555,ARGUMENT.,"Who far at distance on the beach should wait,"
3556,ARGUMENT.,"And to the 'scaped, if some should 'scape the snare"
3557,ARGUMENT.,"Should offer friendship and the pilot's care,"
3558,ARGUMENT.,"But when at sea, on rocks should dash their pride,"
3559,ARGUMENT.,And whelm their lofty vanes beneath the tide.
3560,ARGUMENT.,
3561,ARGUMENT.,"Apollo[107] now had left his wat'ry bed,"
3562,ARGUMENT.,And o'er the mountains of Arabia spread
3563,ARGUMENT.,"His rays that glow'd with gold; when GAMA rose,"
3564,ARGUMENT.,And from his bands a trusty squadron chose:
3565,ARGUMENT.,Three speedy barges brought their casks to fill
3566,ARGUMENT.,"From gurgling fountain, or the crystal rill:"
3567,ARGUMENT.,"Full arm'd they came, for brave defence prepar'd,"
3568,ARGUMENT.,For martial care is ever on the guard:
3569,ARGUMENT.,And secret warnings ever are imprest
3570,ARGUMENT.,On wisdom such as wak'd in GAMA'S breast.
3571,ARGUMENT.,
3572,ARGUMENT.,"And now, as swiftly springing o'er the tide"
3573,ARGUMENT.,"Advanc'd the boats, a troop of Moors they spied;"
3574,ARGUMENT.,"O'er the pale sands the sable warriors crowd,"
3575,ARGUMENT.,"And toss their threat'ning darts, and shout aloud."
3576,ARGUMENT.,"Yet seeming artless, though they dar'd the fight,"
3577,ARGUMENT.,"Their eager hope they plac'd in artful flight,"
3578,ARGUMENT.,"To lead brave GAMA where, unseen by day,"
3579,ARGUMENT.,In dark-brow'd shades their silent ambush lay.
3580,ARGUMENT.,"With scornful gestures o'er the beach they stride,"
3581,ARGUMENT.,"And push their levell'd spears with barb'rous pride,"
3582,ARGUMENT.,"Then fix the arrow to the bended bow,"

3584,ARGUMENT.,"With gen'rous rage the Lusian race beheld,"
3585,ARGUMENT.,"And each brave breast with indignation swell'd,"
3586,ARGUMENT.,"To view such foes, like snarling dogs, display"
3587,ARGUMENT.,"Their threat'ning tusks, and brave the sanguine fray:"
3588,ARGUMENT.,"Together with a bound they spring to land,"
3589,ARGUMENT.,Unknown whose step first trod the hostile strand.
3590,ARGUMENT.,
3591,ARGUMENT.,"Thus, when to gain his beauteous charmer's smile,"
3592,ARGUMENT.,"The youthful lover dares the bloody toil,[108]"
3593,ARGUMENT.,"Before the nodding bull's stern front he stands,"
3594,ARGUMENT.,"He leaps, he wheels, he shouts, and waves his hands:"
3595,ARGUMENT.,"The lordly brute disdains the stripling's rage,"
3596,ARGUMENT.,"His nostrils smoke, and, eager to engage,"
3597,ARGUMENT.,"His hornèd brows he levels with the ground,"
3598,ARGUMENT.,"And shuts his flaming eyes, and wheeling round"
3599,ARGUMENT.,"With dreadful bellowing rushes on the foe,"
3600,ARGUMENT.,And lays the boastful gaudy champion low.
3601,ARGUMENT.,"Thus to the sight the sons of Lusus sprung,"
3602,ARGUMENT.,Nor slow to fall their ample vengeance hung:
3603,ARGUMENT.,"With sudden roar the carabines resound,"
3604,ARGUMENT.,And bursting echoes from the hills rebound;
3605,ARGUMENT.,"The lead flies hissing through the trembling air,"
3606,ARGUMENT.,And death's fell dæmons through the flashes glare.
3607,ARGUMENT.,"Where, up the land, a grove of palms enclose,"
3608,ARGUMENT.,"And cast their shadows where the fountain flows,"
3609,ARGUMENT.,The lurking ambush from their treach'rous stand
3610,ARGUMENT.,Beheld the combat burning on the strand:
3611,ARGUMENT.,"They see the flash with sudden lightnings flare,"
3612,ARGUMENT.,And the blue smoke slow rolling on the air:
3613,ARGUMENT.,"They see their warriors drop, and starting hear"
3614,ARGUMENT.,The ling'ring thunders bursting on their ear.
3615,ARGUMENT.,"Amaz'd, appall'd, the treach'rous ambush fled,"
3616,ARGUMENT.,"And rag'd,[109] and curs'd their birth, and quak'd with dread."
3617,ARGUMENT.,"The bands that vaunting show'd their threaten'd might,"
3618,ARGUMENT.,"With slaughter gor'd, precipitate in flight;"
3619,ARGUMENT.,"Yet oft, though trembling, on the foe they turn"

3621,ARGUMENT.,"Aghast with fear, and stern with desperate rage"
3622,ARGUMENT.,"The flying war with dreadful howls they wage,"
3623,ARGUMENT.,"Flints, clods, and javelins hurling as they fly,"
3624,ARGUMENT.,As rage[110] and wild despair their hands supply:
3625,ARGUMENT.,"And, soon dispers'd, their bands attempt no more"
3626,ARGUMENT.,To guard the fountain or defend the shore:
3627,ARGUMENT.,O'er the wide lawns no more their troops appear:
3628,ARGUMENT.,Nor sleeps the vengeance of the victor here;
3629,ARGUMENT.,To teach the nations what tremendous fate
3630,ARGUMENT.,"_From his right arm on perjur'd vows should wait,"
3631,ARGUMENT.,"He seized the time to awe the Eastern world,"
3632,ARGUMENT.,And on the breach of faith his thunders hurl'd.
3633,ARGUMENT.,"From his black ships the sudden lightnings blaze,"
3634,ARGUMENT.,And o'er old Ocean flash their dreadful rays:
3635,ARGUMENT.,"White clouds on clouds inroll'd the smoke ascends,"
3636,ARGUMENT.,The bursting tumult heaven's wide concave rends:
3637,ARGUMENT.,The bays and caverns of the winding shore
3638,ARGUMENT.,Repeat the cannon's and the mortar's roar:
3639,ARGUMENT.,"The bombs, far-flaming, hiss along the sky,"
3640,ARGUMENT.,"And, whirring through the air, the bullets fly;"
3641,ARGUMENT.,"The wounded air, with hollow deafen'd sound,"
3642,ARGUMENT.,"Groans to the direful strife, and trembles round._"
3643,ARGUMENT.,
3644,ARGUMENT.,"_Now from the Moorish town the sheets of fire,"
3645,ARGUMENT.,"Wide blaze succeeding blaze, to heaven aspire."
3646,ARGUMENT.,"Black rise the clouds of smoke, and by the gales"
3647,ARGUMENT.,"Borne down, in streams hang hov'ring o'er the vales;"
3648,ARGUMENT.,And slowly floating round the mountain's head
3649,ARGUMENT.,Their pitchy mantle o'er the landscape spread.
3650,ARGUMENT.,"Unnumber'd sea-fowl rising from the shore,"
3651,ARGUMENT.,Beat round in whirls at every cannon's roar;
3652,ARGUMENT.,"Where o'er the smoke the masts' tall heads appear,"
3653,ARGUMENT.,"Hov'ring they scream, then dart with sudden fear;"
3654,ARGUMENT.,"On trembling wings far round and round they fly,"

3656,ARGUMENT.,Thus fled in rout confus'd the treach'rous Moors

3658,ARGUMENT.,"Some trust in boats their wealth and lives to save,"
3659,ARGUMENT.,"And, wild with dread, they plunge into the wave;"
3660,ARGUMENT.,"Some spread their arms to swim, and some beneath"
3661,ARGUMENT.,"The whelming billows, struggling, pant for breath,"
3662,ARGUMENT.,Then whirl'd aloft their nostrils spout the brine;
3663,ARGUMENT.,While show'ring still from many a carabine
3664,ARGUMENT.,"The leaden hail their sails and vessels tore,"
3665,ARGUMENT.,"Till, struggling hard, they reach'd the neighb'ring shore:"
3666,ARGUMENT.,"Due vengeance thus their perfidy repaid,"
3667,ARGUMENT.,And GAMA'S terrors to the East display'd.
3668,ARGUMENT.,
3669,ARGUMENT.,Imbrown'd with dust a beaten pathway shows
3670,ARGUMENT.,Where 'midst umbrageous palms the fountain flows;
3671,ARGUMENT.,"From thence, at will, they bear the liquid health;"
3672,ARGUMENT.,"And now, sole masters of the island's wealth,"
3673,ARGUMENT.,"With costly spoils and eastern robes adorn'd,"
3674,ARGUMENT.,The joyful victors to the fleet return'd.
3675,ARGUMENT.,
3676,ARGUMENT.,With hell's keen fires still for revenge athirst
3677,ARGUMENT.,"The regent burns, and weens, by fraud accurst,"
3678,ARGUMENT.,"To strike a surer yet a secret blow,"

3680,ARGUMENT.,The promis'd pilot to the fleet he sends
3681,ARGUMENT.,And deep repentance for his crime pretends.

3683,ARGUMENT.,The winning tears steal down his hoary cheeks.
3684,ARGUMENT.,"Brave GAMA, touch'd with gen'rous woe, believes,"
3685,ARGUMENT.,And from his hand the pilot's hand receives:
3686,ARGUMENT.,"A dreadful gift! instructed to decoy,"
3687,ARGUMENT.,"In gulfs to whelm them, or on rocks destroy."
3688,ARGUMENT.,
3689,ARGUMENT.,"The valiant chief, impatient of delay,"
3690,ARGUMENT.,For India now resumes the wat'ry way;
3691,ARGUMENT.,"Bids weigh the anchor and unfurl the sail,"
3692,ARGUMENT.,Spread full the canvas to the rising gale.
3693,ARGUMENT.,"He spoke: and proudly o'er the foaming tide,"
3694,ARGUMENT.,"Borne on the wind, the full-wing'd vessels ride;"
3695,ARGUMENT.,While as they rode before the bounding prows
3696,ARGUMENT.,The lovely forms of sea-born nymphs arose.
3697,ARGUMENT.,The while brave VASCO'S unsuspecting mind
3698,ARGUMENT.,Yet fear'd not ought the crafty Moor design'd:
3699,ARGUMENT.,"Much of the coast he asks, and much demands"
3700,ARGUMENT.,Of Afric's shores and India's spicy lands.
3701,ARGUMENT.,The crafty Moor by vengeful Bacchus taught
3702,ARGUMENT.,Employ'd on deadly guile his baneful thought;
3703,ARGUMENT.,"In his dark mind he plann'd, on GAMA'S head"
3704,ARGUMENT.,Full to revenge Mozambique and the dead.
3705,ARGUMENT.,"Yet all the chief demanded he reveal'd,"
3706,ARGUMENT.,"Nor aught of truth, that truth he knew, conceal'"
3707,ARGUMENT.,"For thus he ween'd to gain his easy faith,"
3708,ARGUMENT.,"And gain'd, betray to slavery or death."
3709,ARGUMENT.,"And now, securely trusting to destroy,"
3710,ARGUMENT.,"As erst false Sinon[112] snar'd the sons of Troy,"

3718,ARGUMENT.,"And thy glad lips my gratitude shall tell."""
3719,ARGUMENT.,"With sullen joy the treach'rous Moor complied,"
3720,ARGUMENT.,And for that island turn'd the helm aside.
3721,ARGUMENT.,"For well Quiloa's[113] swarthy race he knew,"
3722,ARGUMENT.,Their laws and faith to Hagar's offspring true;
3723,ARGUMENT.,"Their strength in war, through all the nations round,"
3724,ARGUMENT.,Above Mozambique and her powers renown'd;
3725,ARGUMENT.,"He knew what hate the Christian name they bore,"
3726,ARGUMENT.,And hop'd that hate on VASCO'S bands to pour.
3727,ARGUMENT.,
3728,ARGUMENT.,"Right to the land the faithless pilot steers,"
3729,ARGUMENT.,Right to the land the glad Armada bears;
3730,ARGUMENT.,"But heavenly Love's fair queen,[114] whose watchful care"
3731,ARGUMENT.,"Had ever been their guide, beheld the snare."
3732,ARGUMENT.,"A sudden storm she rais'd: loud howl'd the blast,"
3733,ARGUMENT.,"The yard-arms rattled, and each groaning mast"
3734,ARGUMENT.,"Bended beneath the weight. Deep sunk the prows,"
3735,ARGUMENT.,And creaking ropes the creaking ropes oppose;
3736,ARGUMENT.,"In vain the pilot would the speed restrain,"
3737,ARGUMENT.,"The captain shouts, the sailors toil in vain;"
3738,ARGUMENT.,"Aslope and gliding on the leeward side,"
3739,ARGUMENT.,The bounding vessels cut the roaring tide:
3740,ARGUMENT.,Soon far they pass'd; and now the slacken'd sail
3741,ARGUMENT.,Trembles and bellies to the gentle gale:
3742,ARGUMENT.,Now many a league before the tempest toss'd
3743,ARGUMENT.,The treach'rous pilot sees his purpose cross'd:
3744,ARGUMENT.,"Yet vengeful still, and still intent on guile,"
3745,ARGUMENT.,"Behold, he cries, yon dim emerging isle:"
3746,ARGUMENT.,There live the votaries of Messiah's lore
3747,ARGUMENT.,"In faithful peace, and friendship with the Moor."
3748,ARGUMENT.,"Yet all was false, for there Messiah's name,"
3749,ARGUMENT.,"Reviled and scorn'd, was only known by fame."
3750,ARGUMENT.,"The grovelling natives there, a brutal herd,"
3751,ARGUMENT.,The sensual lore of Hagar's son[115] preferr'd.
3752,ARGUMENT.,"With joy brave GAMA hears the artful tale,"
3753,ARGUMENT.,"Bears to the harbour, and bids furl the sail."
3754,ARGUMENT.,"Yet, watchful still, fair Love's celestial queen"
3755,ARGUMENT.,Prevents the danger with a hand unseen;
3756,ARGUMENT.,"Now past the bar his vent'rous vessel guides,"
3757,ARGUMENT.,And safe at anchor in the road he rides.

3759,ARGUMENT.,Between the isle and Ethiopia's land
3760,ARGUMENT.,A narrow current laves each adverse strand;
3761,ARGUMENT.,"Close by the margin where the green tide flows,"
3762,ARGUMENT.,Full to the bay a lordly city rose;
3763,ARGUMENT.,With fervid blaze the glowing evening pours
3764,ARGUMENT.,Its purple splendours o'er the lofty towers;
3765,ARGUMENT.,"The lofty towers with milder lustre gleam,"
3766,ARGUMENT.,And gently tremble in the glassy stream.
3767,ARGUMENT.,Here reign'd a hoary king of ancient fame;
3768,ARGUMENT.,"Mombas the town, Mombas the island's name."
3769,ARGUMENT.,
3770,ARGUMENT.,"As when the pilgrim, who with weary pace"
3771,ARGUMENT.,"Thro' lonely wastes untrod by human race,"
3772,ARGUMENT.,"For many a day disconsolate has stray'd,"
3773,ARGUMENT.,"The turf his bed, the wild-wood boughs his shade,"
3774,ARGUMENT.,O'erjoy'd beholds the cheerful seats of men
3775,ARGUMENT.,In grateful prospect rising on his ken:
3776,ARGUMENT.,"So GAMA joy'd, who many a dreary day"
3777,ARGUMENT.,"Had traced the vast, the lonesome, wat'ry way,"
3778,ARGUMENT.,"Had seen new stars, unknown to Europe, rise,"
3779,ARGUMENT.,And brav'd the horrors of the polar skies:
3780,ARGUMENT.,"So joy'd his bounding heart when, proudly rear'd,"
3781,ARGUMENT.,"The splendid city o'er the wave appear'd,"
3782,ARGUMENT.,"Where Heaven's own lore, he trusted, was obey'd,"

3786,ARGUMENT.,To GAMA'S fleet with friendly smiles they bore
3787,ARGUMENT.,The choicest products of their cultur'd shore.
3788,ARGUMENT.,"But there fell rancour veil'd its serpent-head,"
3789,ARGUMENT.,Though festive roses o'er the gifts were spread.

4036,THE ARGUMENT.,"From the bar'd rock's dread jaws the billows roll'd,"
4037,THE ARGUMENT.,"Opening in instant fate the fleet to whelm,"
4038,THE ARGUMENT.,When ready VASCO caught the stagg'ring helm:
4039,THE ARGUMENT.,"Swift as his lofty voice resounds aloud,"
4040,THE ARGUMENT.,"The pond'rous anchors dash the whit'ning flood,"
4041,THE ARGUMENT.,"And round his vessel, nodding o'er the tide,"
4042,THE ARGUMENT.,"His other ships, bound by their anchors, ride."
4043,THE ARGUMENT.,And now revolving in his piercing thought
4044,THE ARGUMENT.,These various scenes with hidden import fraught:
4045,THE ARGUMENT.,"The boastful pilot's self-accusing flight,"
4046,THE ARGUMENT.,The former treason of the Moorish spite;
4047,THE ARGUMENT.,"How headlong to the rock the furious wind,"
4048,THE ARGUMENT.,"The boiling current, and their art combin'd;"
4049,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet, though the groaning blast the canvas swell'd,"
4050,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some wondrous cause, unknown, their speed withheld:"
4051,THE ARGUMENT.,"Amaz'd, with hands high rais'd, and sparkling eyes,"
4052,THE ARGUMENT.,"""A[128] miracle!"" the raptur'd GAMA cries,"
4053,THE ARGUMENT.,"""A miracle! O hail, thou sacred sign,"
4054,THE ARGUMENT.,Thou pledge illustrious of the care divine!
4055,THE ARGUMENT.,Ah! fraudful malice! how shall wisdom's care
4056,THE ARGUMENT.,Escape the poison of thy gilded snare?
4057,THE ARGUMENT.,"The front of honesty, the saintly show,"
4058,THE ARGUMENT.,"The smile of friendship, and the holy vow"
4059,THE ARGUMENT.,"All, all conjoin'd our easy faith to gain,"
4060,THE ARGUMENT.,"To whelm us, shipwreck'd, in the ruthless main;"
4061,THE ARGUMENT.,"But where our prudence no deceit could spy,"
4062,THE ARGUMENT.,"There, heavenly Guardian, there thy watchful eye"
4063,THE ARGUMENT.,"Beheld our danger: still, oh still prevent,"
4064,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where human foresight fails, the dire intent,"
4065,THE ARGUMENT.,The lurking treason of the smiling foe;
4066,THE ARGUMENT.,"And let our toils, our days of length'ning woe,"
4067,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our weary wand'rings end. If still for thee,"
4068,THE ARGUMENT.,"To spread thy rites, our toils and vows agree,"
4069,THE ARGUMENT.,"On India's strand thy sacred shrines to rear,"
4070,THE ARGUMENT.,Oh let some friendly land of rest appear:
4071,THE ARGUMENT.,"If for thine honour we these toils have dar'd,"
4072,THE ARGUMENT.,"These toils let India's long-sought shore reward."""
4073,THE ARGUMENT.,
4074,THE ARGUMENT.,So spoke the chief: the pious accents move
4075,THE ARGUMENT.,The gentle bosom of celestial Love:
4076,THE ARGUMENT.,The beauteous Queen[129] to heaven now darts away;
4077,THE ARGUMENT.,In vain the weeping nymphs implore her stay:
4078,THE ARGUMENT.,"Behind her now the morning star she leaves,"
4079,THE ARGUMENT.,And the[130] sixth heaven her lovely form receives.
4080,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her radiant eyes such living splendours cast,"
4081,THE ARGUMENT.,The sparkling stars were brighten'd as she pass'd;
4082,THE ARGUMENT.,"The frozen pole with sudden streamlets flow'd,"
4083,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, as the burning zone, with fervour glow'd."
4084,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now confess'd before the throne of Jove,"
4085,THE ARGUMENT.,In all her charms appears the Queen of Love:
4086,THE ARGUMENT.,Flush'd by the ardour of her rapid flight
4087,THE ARGUMENT.,"Through fields of æther and the realms of light,"
4088,THE ARGUMENT.,"Bright as the blushes of the roseate morn,"
4089,THE ARGUMENT.,New blooming tints her glowing cheeks adorn;
4090,THE ARGUMENT.,"And all that pride of beauteous grace she wore,"
4091,THE ARGUMENT.,"As[131] when in Ida's bower she stood of yore,"
4092,THE ARGUMENT.,When every charm and every hope of joy
4093,THE ARGUMENT.,Enraptur'd and allur'd the Trojan boy.
4094,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ah![132] had that hunter, whose unhappy fate"
4095,THE ARGUMENT.,"The human visage lost by Dian's hate,"
4096,THE ARGUMENT.,Had he beheld this fairer goddess move
4097,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not hounds had slain him, but the fires of love."
4098,THE ARGUMENT.,"Adown her neck, more white than virgin snow,"
4099,THE ARGUMENT.,Of softest hue the golden tresses flow;
4100,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her heaving breasts of purer, softer white"
4101,THE ARGUMENT.,"Than snow hills glist'ning in the moon's pale light,"
4102,THE ARGUMENT.,"Except where cover'd by the sash, were bare,"
4103,THE ARGUMENT.,"And[133] Love, unseen, smil'd soft, and panted there:"
4104,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor less the zone the god's fond zeal employs,"
4105,THE ARGUMENT.,The zone awakes the flames of secret joys.
4106,THE ARGUMENT.,As ivy-tendrils round her limbs divine
4107,THE ARGUMENT.,Their spreading arms the young desires entwine:
4108,THE ARGUMENT.,"Below her waist, and quiv'ring on the gale,"
4109,THE ARGUMENT.,Of thinnest texture flows the silken veil:
4110,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Ah! where the lucid curtain dimly shows,"
4111,THE ARGUMENT.,With doubled fires the roving fancy glows!)
4112,THE ARGUMENT.,"The hand of modesty the foldings threw,"
4113,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor all conceal'd, nor all was given to view;"
4114,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet her deep grief her lovely face betrays,"
4115,THE ARGUMENT.,Though on her cheek the soft smile falt'ring plays.
4116,THE ARGUMENT.,"All heaven was mov'd--as when some damsel coy,"
4117,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hurt by the rudeness of the am'rous boy,"
4118,THE ARGUMENT.,Offended chides and smiles; with angry mien
4119,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus mixt with smiles, advanc'd the plaintive queen;"
4120,THE ARGUMENT.,"And[134] thus: ""O Thunderer! O potent Sire!"
4121,THE ARGUMENT.,Shall I in vain thy kind regard require?
4122,THE ARGUMENT.,"Alas! and cherish still the fond deceit,"
4123,THE ARGUMENT.,That yet on me thy kindest smiles await.
4124,THE ARGUMENT.,Ah heaven! and must that valour which I love
4125,THE ARGUMENT.,Awake the vengeance and the rage of Jove?
4126,THE ARGUMENT.,Yet mov'd with pity for my fav'rite race
4127,THE ARGUMENT.,"I speak, though frowning on thine awful face,"
4128,THE ARGUMENT.,"I mark the tenor of the dread decree,"
4129,THE ARGUMENT.,That to thy wrath consigns my sons and me.
4130,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yes! let stern Bacchus bless thy partial care,"
4131,THE ARGUMENT.,"His be the triumph, and be mine despair."
4132,THE ARGUMENT.,The bold advent'rous sons of Tago's clime
4133,THE ARGUMENT.,I loved--alas! that love is now their crime:
4134,THE ARGUMENT.,"O happy they, and prosp'rous gales their fate,"
4135,THE ARGUMENT.,Had I pursued them with relentless hate!
4136,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yes! let my woeful sighs in vain implore,"
4137,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yes! let them perish on some barb'rous shore,"
4138,THE ARGUMENT.,"For I have lov'd them."" Here the swelling sigh"
4139,THE ARGUMENT.,"And pearly tear-drop rushing in her eye,"
4140,THE ARGUMENT.,"As morning dew hangs trembling on the rose,"
4141,THE ARGUMENT.,"Though fond to speak, her further speech oppose--"
4142,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her lips, then moving, as the pause of woe"
4143,THE ARGUMENT.,Were now to give the voice of grief to flow;
4144,THE ARGUMENT.,"When kindled by those charms, whose woes might move"
4145,THE ARGUMENT.,And melt the prowling tiger's rage to love.
4146,THE ARGUMENT.,"The thundering-god her weeping sorrows eyed,"
4147,THE ARGUMENT.,And sudden threw his awful state aside:
4148,THE ARGUMENT.,"With[135] that mild look which stills the driving storm,"
4149,THE ARGUMENT.,When black roll'd clouds the face of heaven deform;
4150,THE ARGUMENT.,With that mild visage and benignant mien
4151,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which to the sky restores the blue serene,"
4152,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her snowy neck and glowing cheek he press'd,"
4153,THE ARGUMENT.,"And wip'd her tears, and clasp'd her to his breast;"
4154,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet she, still sighing, dropp'd the trickling tear,"
4155,THE ARGUMENT.,"As the chid nursling, mov'd with pride and fear,"
4156,THE ARGUMENT.,"Still sighs and moans, though fondled and caress'd;"
4157,THE ARGUMENT.,Till thus great Jove the Fates' decrees confess'd:
4158,THE ARGUMENT.,"""O thou, my daughter, still belov'd as fair,"
4159,THE ARGUMENT.,"Vain are thy fears, thy heroes claim my care:"
4160,THE ARGUMENT.,"No power of gods could e'er my heart incline,"
4161,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like one fond smile, one powerful tear of thine."
4162,THE ARGUMENT.,Wide o'er the eastern shores shalt thou behold
4163,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy flags far streaming, and thy thunders roll'd;"
4164,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where nobler triumphs shall thy nation crown,"
4165,THE ARGUMENT.,Than those of Roman or of Greek renown.
4166,THE ARGUMENT.,
4167,THE ARGUMENT.,"""If by mine aid the sapient Greek[136] could brave"
4168,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th' Ogygian seas, nor sink a deathless slave;[137]"
4169,THE ARGUMENT.,"If through th' Illyrian shelves Antenor bore,"
4170,THE ARGUMENT.,Till safe he landed on Timavus' shore;
4171,THE ARGUMENT.,"If, by his fate, the pious Trojan[138] led,"
4172,THE ARGUMENT.,Safe through Charybdis'[139] barking whirlpools sped:
4173,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shall thy bold heroes, by my care disclaim'd,"
4174,THE ARGUMENT.,"Be left to perish, who, to worlds unnam'd"
4175,THE ARGUMENT.,"By vaunting Rome, pursue their dauntless way?"
4176,THE ARGUMENT.,"No--soon shalt thou with ravish'd eyes survey,"
4177,THE ARGUMENT.,"From stream to stream their lofty cities spread,"
4178,THE ARGUMENT.,And their proud turrets rear the warlike head:

4187,THE ARGUMENT.,O wondrous fate! when not a breathing[140] gale
4188,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shall curl the billows, or distend the sail,"
4189,THE ARGUMENT.,"The waves shall boil and tremble, aw'd with dread,"
4190,THE ARGUMENT.,And own the terror o'er their empire spread.

4204,THE ARGUMENT.,Shower'd on his legions by the hand of Heaven.
4205,THE ARGUMENT.,"Though twice assail'd by many a vengeful band,"
4206,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unconquer'd still shall Dio's ramparts stand,"
4207,THE ARGUMENT.,Such prowess there shall raise the Lusian name
4208,THE ARGUMENT.,That Mars shall tremble for his blighted fame;

8532,THE ARGUMENT.,"contrary practice of Homer and Virgil affords, in reality, no reasonable"
8533,THE ARGUMENT.,"objection against the exclamatory exuberances of Camoëns. Homer, though"
8534,THE ARGUMENT.,"the father of the epic poem, has his exuberances, which violently"
8535,THE ARGUMENT.,"trespass against the first rule of the epopea, the unity of the action."
8536,THE ARGUMENT.,"A rule which, strictly speaking, is not outraged by the digressive"
8537,THE ARGUMENT.,"exclamations of Camoëns. The one now before us, as the severest critic"

8539,THE ARGUMENT.,dangers which the hero had hitherto encountered are particularly
8540,THE ARGUMENT.,"described. He is afterwards brought in safety to the Indian shore, the"
8541,THE ARGUMENT.,"object of his ambition, and of all his toils. The exclamation,"
8542,THE ARGUMENT.,"therefore, on the grand hinge of the poem has its propriety, and"
8543,THE ARGUMENT.,"discovers the warmth of its author's genius. It must also please, as it"
8544,THE ARGUMENT.,is strongly characteristic of the temper of our military poet. The manly
8545,THE ARGUMENT.,"contempt with which he speaks of the luxurious, inactive courtier, and"
8546,THE ARGUMENT.,"the delight and honour with which he talks of the toils of the soldier,"
8547,THE ARGUMENT.,present his own active life to the reader of sensibility. His campaigns
8548,THE ARGUMENT.,"in Africa, where in a gallant attack he lost an eye, his dangerous life"
8549,THE ARGUMENT.,"at sea, and the military fatigues, and the battles in which he bore an"
8550,THE ARGUMENT.,"honourable share in India, rise to our idea, and possess us with an"
8551,THE ARGUMENT.,"esteem and admiration of our martial poet, who thus could look back with"
8552,THE ARGUMENT.,a gallant enthusiasm (though his modesty does not mention himself) on
8553,THE ARGUMENT.,all the hardships he had endured; who thus could bravely esteem the
8554,THE ARGUMENT.,"dangers to which he had been exposed, and by which he had severely"
8555,THE ARGUMENT.,"suffered, as the most desirable occurrences of his life, and the"
8556,THE ARGUMENT.,ornament of his name.

11298,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"descriptions of this kind which abound in the old romances. In these,"
11299,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"under different allegorical names, every passion, every virtue and vice,"
11300,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"had its palace, its enchanted bower, or its dreary cave. Among the"
11301,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"Italians, on the revival of letters, Pulci, Boiardo, and others,"
11302,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,borrowed these fictions from the Gothic romancers; Ariosto borrowed from
11303,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"them, and Spenser has copied Ariosto and Tasso. In the sixth and seventh"
11304,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"books of the Orlando Furioso, there is a fine description of the island"
11305,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"and palace of Alcina, or Vice; and in the tenth book (but inferior to"
11306,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"the other in poetical colouring), we have a view of the country of"
11307,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"Logistilla, or Virtue. The passage, of this kind, however, where Ariosto"
11308,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"has displayed the richest poetical painting, is in the xxxiv. book, in"
11309,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"the description of Paradise, whither he sends Astolpho, the English"
11310,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"duke, to ask the help of St. John to recover the wits of Orlando. The"
11311,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,whole is most admirably fanciful. Astolpho mounts the clouds on the
11312,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"winged horse, sees Paradise, and, accompanied by the Evangelist, visits"
11313,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,the moon; the adventures in which orb are almost literally translated in
11314,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,Milton's Limbo. But the passage which may be said to bear the nearest
11315,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"resemblance to the descriptive part of the island of Venus, is the"
11316,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"landscape of Paradise, of which the ingenious Mr. Hoole, to whose many"
11317,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"acts of friendship I am proud to acknowledge myself indebted, has"
11318,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"obliged me with this translation, though only ten books of his Ariosto"

11366,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,borrowed the hint of his island of Venus from that poet. The luxury of
11367,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,flowery description is as common in poetry as are the tales of love. The

11387,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,the use of the alphabet: and indeed the greatest part of these

11411,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"with certainty, pronounce from whence the copy is taken. Where only a"
11412,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"similar stroke of passion or description occurs, it belongs alone to the"
11413,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"arrogance of dulness, to tell us on what passage the poet had his eye."
11414,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,Every great poet has been persecuted in this manner: Milton in
11415,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,particular. His commentators have not left him a flower of his own
11416,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"growth. Yet, like the creed of the atheist, their system is involved in"
11417,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,the deepest absurdity. It is easy to suppose that men of poetical
11418,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"feelings, in describing the same thing, should give us the same picture."
11419,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"But, that the Paradise Lost, which forms one animated whole of the"
11420,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"noblest poetry, is a mere cento, compiled from innumerable authors,"
11421,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"ancient and modern, is a supposition which gives Milton a cast of"
11422,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,talents infinitely more extraordinary and inexplicable than the greatest
11423,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,poetical genius. When Gaspar Poussin painted clouds and trees in his
11424,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"landscapes, he did not borrow the green and the blue of the leaf and"
11425,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"the sky from Claude Lorraine. Neither did Camoëns, when he painted his"
11426,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"island of Venus, spend the half of his life in collecting his colours"
11427,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,from all his predecessors who had described the beauties of the vernal
11428,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"year, or the stages of passion. Camoëns knew how others had painted the"
11429,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"flowery bowers of love; these formed his taste, and corrected his"
11430,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"judgment. He viewed the beauties of nature with poetical eyes, from"
11431,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"thence he drew his landscapes; he had felt all the allurements of love,"
11432,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,and from thence he describes the agitations of that passion.
11433,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,
11434,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"Nor is the description of fairy bowers and palaces, though most"
11435,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"favourite topics, peculiar to the romances of chivalry. The poetry of"
11436,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"the orientals also abounds with them, yet, with some characteristic"
11437,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"differences. Like the constitutions and dress of the Asiatics, the"
11438,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"landscapes of the eastern muse are warm and feeble, brilliant and"
11439,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"slight, and, like the manners of the people, wear an eternal sameness."
11440,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"The western muse, on the contrary, is nervous as her heroes, sometimes"
11441,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"flowery as her Italian or English fields, sometimes majestically great"
11442,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"as her Runic forests of oak and pine; and always various, as the"
11443,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"character of her inhabitants. Yet, with all those differences of"
11444,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"feature, several oriental fictions greatly resemble the island of Circe,"
11445,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"and the flowery dominions of Alcina. In particular, the adventures of"
11446,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"Prince Agib, or the third Calender, in the Arabian Tales, afford a"
11447,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,striking likeness of painting and catastrophe.
11448,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,
11449,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"If Ariosto's, however, seem to resemble any eastern fiction, the island"
11450,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,of Venus in Camoëns bears a more striking resemblance to a passage in
11451,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,Chaucer. The following beautiful piece of poetical painting occurs in
11452,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,the Assembly of the Fowles:--

11512,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"and _women enow_. In a word, the island of Venus is here sketched out,"
11513,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,yet Chaucer was never translated into Latin or any language of the
11514,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"continent, nor did Camoëns understand a line of English. The subject was"
11515,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"common, and the same poetical feelings in Chaucer and Camoëns pointed"
11516,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,out to each what were the beauties of landscapes and of bowers devoted
11517,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,to pleasure.
11518,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,
11519,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"Yet, though the fiction of bowers, of islands, and palaces, was no"
11520,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"novelty in poetry, much, however, remains to be attributed to the"
11521,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"poetical powers and invention of Camoëns. The island of Venus contains,"
11522,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"of all others, by much the completest gradation, and fullest assemblage"
11523,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,of that species of luxuriant painting. Nothing in the older writers is
11524,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"equal to it in fulness. Nor can the island of Armida, in Tasso, be"
11525,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"compared to it, in poetical embroidery or passionate expression; though"
11526,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"Tasso as undoubtedly built upon the model of Camoëns, as Spenser"
11527,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,appropriated the imagery of Tasso when he described the bower of
11528,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"Acrasia, part of which he has literally translated from the Italian"
11529,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"poet. The beautiful fictions of Armida and Acrasia, however, are much"
11530,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"too long to be here inserted, and they are well known to every reader of"
11531,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,taste.
11532,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,
11533,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,But the chief praise of our poet is yet unmentioned. The introduction of
11534,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,so beautiful a fiction as an essential part of the conduct and machinery
11535,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"of an epic poem, does the greatest honour to the invention of Camoëns."
11536,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"The machinery of the former part of the poem not only acquires dignity,"
11537,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"but is completed by it. And the conduct of Homer and Virgil has, in"
11538,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"this, not only received a fine imitation, but a masterly contrast. In"
11539,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"the finest allegory the heroes of the Lusiad receive their reward: and,"
11540,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"by means of this allegory, our poet gives a noble imitation of the"
11541,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"noblest part of the Æneid. In the tenth Lusiad, GAMA and his heroes hear"
11542,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,the nymphs in the divine palace of Thetis sing the triumphs of their
11543,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,countrymen in the conquest of India: after this the goddess shows GAMA a
11544,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"view of the eastern world, from the Cape of Good Hope to the furthest"
11545,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"islands of Japan. She poetically describes every region, and the"
11546,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"principal islands, and concludes, ""All these are given to the western"
11547,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"world by you."" It is impossible any poem can be summed up with greater"
11548,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,sublimity. The Fall of Troy is nothing to this. Nor is this all: the
11549,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"most masterly fiction, finest compliment, and ultimate purpose of the"
11550,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"Æneid is not only nobly imitated, but the conduct of Homer, in"
11551,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"concluding the Iliad, as already observed, is paralleled, without one"
11552,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,circumstance being borrowed. Poetical conduct cannot possibly bear a
11553,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"stronger resemblance, than the reward of the heroes of the Lusiad, the"
11554,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"prophetic song, and the vision shown to GAMA bear to the games at the"
11555,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"funeral of Patroclus and the redemption of the body of Hector,"
11556,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"considered as the completion of the anger of Achilles, the subject of"
11557,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"the Iliad. Nor is it a greater honour to resemble a Homer and a Virgil,"
11558,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,than it is to be resembled by a Milton. Milton certainly heard of
11559,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"Fanshaw's translation of the Lusiad, though he might never have seen the"
11560,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"original, for it was published fourteen years before he gave his"
11561,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"Paradise Lost to the world. But, whatever he knew of it, had the last"
11562,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"book of the Lusiad been two thousand years known to the learned, every"
11563,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,one would have owned that the two last boots of the Paradise Lost were
11564,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,evidently formed upon it. But whether Milton borrowed any hint from
11565,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,Camoëns is of little consequence. That the genius of the great Milton

11567,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"machinery of the Lusiad, is enough. It is enough that the part of"
11568,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"Michael and Adam in the two last books of the Paradise Lost are, in"
11569,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"point of conduct, exactly the same with the part of Thetis and GAMA in"
11570,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"the conclusion of the Lusiad. Yet, this difference must be observed; in"
11571,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,"the narrative of his last book, Milton has flagged, as Addison calls it,"
11572,FICTION OF THE ISLAND OF VENUS.,and fallen infinitely short of the untired spirit of the Portuguese

11585,THE ARGUMENT.,"In the opening of this, the last canto, the poet resumes the allegory of"
11586,THE ARGUMENT.,"the Isle of Joy, or of Venus: the fair nymphs conduct their lovers to"
11587,THE ARGUMENT.,"their radiant palaces, where delicious wines sparkle in every cup."
11588,THE ARGUMENT.,"Before the poet describes the song of a prophetic siren, who celebrates"
11589,THE ARGUMENT.,the praise of the heroes who are destined in ennoble the name of their
11590,THE ARGUMENT.,"country, he addresses himself to his muse in a tone of sorrow, which"
11591,THE ARGUMENT.,touches us the more deeply when we reflect upon the unhappy situation to
11592,THE ARGUMENT.,"which this great poet was at last reduced. In the song of the siren,"
11593,THE ARGUMENT.,"which follows, is afforded a prophetic view from the period of Gama's"
11594,THE ARGUMENT.,"expedition down to Camoëns' own times, in which Pacheco, and other"
11595,THE ARGUMENT.,"heroes of Portugal, pass in review before the eye of the reader. When"
11596,THE ARGUMENT.,"the siren has concluded her prophetic song, Thetis conducts Gama to the"
11597,THE ARGUMENT.,top of a mountain and addresses him in a set speech. The poem concludes
11598,THE ARGUMENT.,with the poet's apostrophe to King Sebastian.

11606,THE ARGUMENT.,"And o'er the last hot breath of parting day,"
11607,THE ARGUMENT.,"Cool o'er the sultry noon's remaining flame,"

11626,THE ARGUMENT.,"Each with the nymph above the rest belov'd,"
11627,THE ARGUMENT.,They seek the palace of the sov'reign dame;
11628,THE ARGUMENT.,High on a mountain glow'd the wondrous frame:
11629,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of gold the towers, of gold the pillars shone,"
11630,THE ARGUMENT.,"The walls were crystal, starr'd with precious stone."
11631,THE ARGUMENT.,"Amid the hall arose the festive board,"
11632,THE ARGUMENT.,With nature's choicest gifts promiscuous stor'd:
11633,THE ARGUMENT.,So will'd the goddess to renew the smile
11634,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of vital strength, long worn by days of toil."
11635,THE ARGUMENT.,"On crystal chairs, that shin'd as lambent flame,"
11636,THE ARGUMENT.,Each gallant youth attends his lovely dame;
11637,THE ARGUMENT.,Beneath a purple canopy of state

11648,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sumptuous tribute of the sea's wide reign,"
11649,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of various savour, was the banquet pil'd;"

11677,THE ARGUMENT.,"The lofty song ascends the thrilling skies,"

12837,FOOTNOTES:,[11] Cardinal Henry's patronage of learning and learned men is mentioned
12838,FOOTNOTES:,with cordial esteem by the Portuguese writers. Happily they also tell us
12839,FOOTNOTES:,what that learning was. It was to him the Romish Friars of the East
12840,FOOTNOTES:,transmitted their childish forgeries of inscriptions and miracles. He
12841,FOOTNOTES:,"corresponded with them, directed their labours, and received the first"
12842,FOOTNOTES:,"accounts of their success. Under his patronage it was discovered, that"
12843,FOOTNOTES:,St. Thomas ordered the Indians to worship the cross; and that the
12844,FOOTNOTES:,"Moorish tradition of Perimal (who, having embraced Mohammedanism,"
12845,FOOTNOTES:,"divided his kingdom among his officers, whom he rendered tributary to"
12846,FOOTNOTES:,"the Zamorim) was a malicious misrepresentation, for that Perimal, having"
12847,FOOTNOTES:,"turned Christian, resigned his kingdom and became a monk. Such was the"
12848,FOOTNOTES:,"learning patronized by Henry, under whose auspices that horrid tribunal,"
12849,FOOTNOTES:,"the Inquisition, was erected at Lisbon, where he himself long presided"
12850,FOOTNOTES:,as Inquisitor-General. Nor was he content with this: he established an
12851,FOOTNOTES:,"Inquisition, also, at Goa, and sent a whole apparatus of holy fathers to"
12852,FOOTNOTES:,"form a court of inquisitors, to suppress the Jews and reduce the native"
12853,FOOTNOTES:,Christians to the see of Rome. Nor must the treatment experienced by

12858,FOOTNOTES:,"soon frustrated by the clergy, at the head of whom was Henry, afterwards"
12859,FOOTNOTES:,"king. Buchanan was committed to prison, because it was alleged that he"
12860,FOOTNOTES:,"had eaten flesh in Lent, and because in his early youth, at St. Andrew's"
12861,FOOTNOTES:,"in Scotland, he had written a satire against the Franciscans; for which,"
12862,FOOTNOTES:,"however, ere he would venture to Lisbon, John had promised absolute"
12863,FOOTNOTES:,"indemnity. John, with much difficulty, procured his release from a"
12864,FOOTNOTES:,"loathsome jail, but could not effect his restoration as a teacher. No,"
12865,FOOTNOTES:,"he only changed his prison, for Buchanan was sent to a monastery ""to be"

12873,FOOTNOTES:,translations of it. A hundred years before Castera's version it appeared
12874,FOOTNOTES:,"in French. Thomas de Faria, Bp. of Targa in Africa, translated it into"

13839,FOOTNOTES:,that to render them pleasing requires a peculiar happiness and delicacy

14097,OVID.,of the Epopæa. The speech of Gama's herald to the King of Melinda is a
14098,OVID.,striking instance of it. The compliments with which it begins have a
14099,OVID.,direct tendency to the favours afterwards to be asked. The assurances of
14100,OVID.,"the innocence, the purpose of the voyagers, and the greatness of their"
14101,OVID.,"king, are happily touched. The exclamation on the barbarous treatment"
14102,OVID.,"they had experienced--""Not wisdom saved us, but Heaven's own care""--are"
14103,OVID.,masterly insinuations. Their barbarous treatment is again repeated in a
14104,OVID.,"manner to move compassion: Alas! what could they fear? etc., is"
14105,OVID.,reasoning joined with pathos. That they were conducted to the King of
14106,OVID.,"Melinda by Heaven, and were by Heaven assured of his truth, is a most"
14107,OVID.,"delicate compliment, and in the true spirit of the epic poem. The"
14108,OVID.,apology for Gama's refusal to come on shore is exceeding artful. It
14109,OVID.,"conveys a proof of the greatness of the Portuguese sovereign, and"
14110,OVID.,"affords a compliment to loyalty, which could not fail to be acceptable"

14165,OVID.,The Southern nations of Europe were sunk into the most contemptible

14169,OVID.,"fatal tendency to enervate the mind, the arts of music and cookery, were"
14170,OVID.,passionately cultivated in all the refinement of effeminate abuse. The
14171,OVID.,"art of war was too laborious for their delicacy, and the generous warmth"
14172,OVID.,of heroism and patriotism was incompatible with their effeminacy. On

14225,OVID.,"the Moors, with whom he was at war, demanded assistance from Philip I."
14226,OVID.,"of France, and the Duke of Burgundy. According to the military spirit of"
14227,OVID.,"the nobility of that age, no sooner was his desire known than numerous"
14228,OVID.,"bodies of troops thronged to his standard. These, in the course of a few"
14229,OVID.,"years, having shown signal proofs of their courage, the king"
14230,OVID.,"distinguished the leaders with different marks of his regard. To Henry,"
14231,OVID.,"a younger son of the Duke of Burgundy, he gave his daughter Teresa in"
14232,OVID.,"marriage, with the sovereignty of the countries to the south of Galicia,"
14233,OVID.,commissioning him to enlarge his boundaries by the expulsion of the
14234,OVID.,"Moors. Under the government of this great man, who reigned by the title"
14235,OVID.,"of Count, his dominion was greatly enlarged, and became more rich and"
14236,OVID.,"populous than before. The two provinces of Entre Minho e Douro, and Tras"
14237,OVID.,"os Montes, were subdued, with that part of Beira which was held by the"
14238,OVID.,"Moorish king of Lamego, whom he constrained to pay tribute. Many"
14239,OVID.,"thousands of Christians, who had either lived in miserable subjection to"
14240,OVID.,"the Moors, or in desolate independency in the mountains, took shelter"
14241,OVID.,under the protection of Count Henry. Great multitudes of the Moors also
14242,OVID.,"chose rather to submit, than be exposed to the severities and the"
14243,OVID.,"continual feuds and seditions of their own governors. These advantages,"
14244,OVID.,"added to the great fertility of the soil of Henry's dominions, will"
14245,OVID.,"account for the numerous armies, and the frequent wars of the first"
14246,OVID.,sovereigns of Portugal.
14247,OVID.,
14248,OVID.,"[196] Camoëns, in making the founder of the Portuguese monarchy a"
14249,OVID.,"younger son of the King of Hungary, has followed the old chronologist"
14250,OVID.,Galvan. The Spanish and Portuguese historians differ widely in their
14251,OVID.,accounts of the parentage of this gallant stranger. Some bring him from
14252,OVID.,"Constantinople, and others from the house of Lorraine. But the clearest"
14253,OVID.,"and most probable account of him is in the chronicle of Fleury, wherein"
14254,OVID.,"is preserved a fragment of French history, written by a Benedictine monk"
14255,OVID.,"in the beginning of the twelfth century, and in the time of Count Henry."
14256,OVID.,"By this it appears, that he was a younger son of Henry, the only son of"
14257,OVID.,"Robert, the first duke of Burgundy, who was a younger brother of Henry"
14258,OVID.,"I. of France. Fanshaw having an eye to this history, has taken the"

14271,OVID.,beautiful Ximena de Guzman. But it appears from the more authentic

14290,OVID.,"minister. When the young prince was in his eighteenth year, some of the"
14291,OVID.,"nobility, who either envied the power of Don Perez, or suspected his"
14292,OVID.,"intention to marry the queen, and exclude the lawful heir, easily"
14293,OVID.,"persuaded the young Count to take arms, and assume the sovereignty. A"
14294,OVID.,"battle ensued, in which the prince was victorious. Teresa, it is said,"
14295,OVID.,"retired into the castle of Legonaso, where she was taken prisoner by her"
14296,OVID.,"son, who condemned her to perpetual imprisonment, and ordered chains to"
14297,OVID.,"be put upon her legs. That Don Alonso made war against his mother,"
14298,OVID.,"vanquished her party, and that she died in prison about two years after,"
14299,OVID.,"A.D. 1130, are certain. But the cause of the war, that his mother was"

14377,OVID.,"[216] This memorable battle was fought in the plains of _Ourique_, in"
14378,OVID.,1139. The engagement lasted six hours; the Moors were totally routed
14379,OVID.,with incredible slaughter. On the field of battle Alonzo was proclaimed
14380,OVID.,King of Portugal. The Portuguese writers have given many fabulous
14381,OVID.,accounts of this victory. Some affirm that the Moorish army amounted to
14382,OVID.,"380,000, others, 480,000, and others swell it to 600,000, whereas Don"
14383,OVID.,"Alonzo's did not exceed 13,000. Miracles must also be added. Alonzo,"
14384,OVID.,"they tell us, being in great perplexity, sat down to comfort his mind by"
14385,OVID.,"the perusal of the Holy Scriptures. Having read the story of Gideon, he"
14386,OVID.,"sunk into a deep sleep, in which he saw a very old man in a remarkable"
14387,OVID.,"dress come into his tent, and assure him of victory. His chamberlain"
14388,OVID.,"coming in, awoke him, and told him there was an old man very importunate"
14389,OVID.,"to speak with him. Don Alonzo ordered him to be brought in, and no"
14390,OVID.,sooner saw him than he knew him to be the old man whom he had seen in
14391,OVID.,"his dream. This venerable person acquainted him that he was a fisherman,"
14392,OVID.,"and had led a life of penance for sixty years on an adjacent rock, where"
14393,OVID.,"it had been revealed to him, that if the count marched his army the next"
14394,OVID.,"morning, as soon as he heard a certain bell ring, he should receive the"
14395,OVID.,"strongest assurance of victory. Accordingly, at the ringing of the bell,"
14396,OVID.,"the count put his army in motion, and suddenly beheld in the eastern sky"
14397,OVID.,"the figure of the cross, and Christ upon it, who promised him a complete"
14398,OVID.,"victory, and commanded him to accept the title of king, if it were"
14399,OVID.,"offered him by the army. The same writers add, that as a standing"
14400,OVID.,"memorial of this miraculous event, Don Alonzo changed the arms which his"
14401,OVID.,"father had given, of a cross azure in a field argent, for five"
14402,OVID.,"escutcheons, each charged with five bezants, in memory of the wounds of"
14403,OVID.,"Christ. Others assert, that he gave, in a field argent, five escutcheons"
14404,OVID.,"azure in the form of a cross, each charged with five bezants argent,"
14405,OVID.,"placed saltierwise, with a point sable, in memory of five wounds he"
14406,OVID.,"himself received, and of five Moorish kings slain in the battle. There"
14407,OVID.,"is an old record, said to be written by Don Alonzo, in which the story"
14408,OVID.,"of the vision is related upon his majesty's oath. The Spanish critics,"
14409,OVID.,"however, have discovered many inconsistencies in it. They find the"
14410,OVID.,language intermixed with phrases not then in use: and it bears the date
14411,OVID.,"of the year of our Lord, at a time when that era had not been introduced"
14412,OVID.,into Spain.

14419,OVID.,name of Britannia to the island.
14420,OVID.,
14421,OVID.,[219] The conquest of Lisbon was of the utmost importance to the infant
14422,OVID.,"monarchy. It is one of the finest ports in the world, and before the"
14423,OVID.,"invention of cannon, was of great strength. The old Moorish wall was"
14424,OVID.,"flanked by seventy-seven towers, was about six miles in length, and"
14425,OVID.,"fourteen in circumference. When besieged by Don Alonzo, according to"
14426,OVID.,"some, it was garrisoned by an army of 200,000 men. This is highly"
14427,OVID.,"incredible. However, that it was strong and well garrisoned is certain,"
14428,OVID.,"as also that Alonzo owed the conquest of it to a fleet of adventurers,"
14429,OVID.,"who were going to the Holy Land, the greater part of whom were English."
14430,OVID.,"One Udal op Rhys, in his tour through Portugal, says, that Alonzo gave"
14431,OVID.,"them Almada, on the side of the Tagus opposite to Lisbon, and that Villa"
14432,OVID.,"Franca was peopled by them, which they called Cornualla, either in"
14433,OVID.,"honour of their native country, or from the rich meadows in its"

14451,A.D. 1540.,"[225] As already observed, there is no authentic proof that Don Alonzo"
14452,A.D. 1540.,used such severity to his mother as to put her in chains. Brandan says
14453,A.D. 1540.,it was reported that Don Alonzo was born with both his legs growing
14454,A.D. 1540.,"together, and that he was cured by the prayers of his tutor, Egas Nunio."
14455,A.D. 1540.,"Legendary as this may appear, this however is deducible from it, that"
14456,A.D. 1540.,from his birth there was something amiss about his legs. When he was
14457,A.D. 1540.,"prisoner to his son-in-law, Don Fernando, king of Leon, he recovered his"
14458,A.D. 1540.,"liberty ere his leg, which was fractured in the battle, was restored, on"
14459,A.D. 1540.,"condition that as soon as he was able to mount on horseback, he should"
14460,A.D. 1540.,"come to Leon, and in person do homage for his dominions. This condition,"
14461,A.D. 1540.,"so contrary to his coronation agreement, he found means to avoid. He"
14462,A.D. 1540.,"ever after affected to drive in a calash, and would never mount on"
14463,A.D. 1540.,horseback more. The superstitious of those days ascribed this infirmity

14528,A.D. 1540.,"country, has in this instance disguised the truth of history. Don Sancho"
14529,A.D. 1540.,"was by no means the weak prince here represented, nor did the miseries"
14530,A.D. 1540.,of his reign proceed from himself. The clergy were the sole authors of
14531,A.D. 1540.,"his, and the public, calamities. The Roman See was then in the height of"
14532,A.D. 1540.,"its power, which it exerted in the most tyrannical manner. The"
14533,A.D. 1540.,ecclesiastical courts had long claimed the sole right to try an
14534,A.D. 1540.,"ecclesiastic: and, to prohibit a priest to say mass for a twelve-month,"
14535,A.D. 1540.,"was by the brethren, his judges, esteemed a sufficient punishment for"
14536,A.D. 1540.,"murder, or any other capital crime. Alonzo II., the father of Don"
14537,A.D. 1540.,"Sancho, attempted to establish the authority of the king's courts of"
14538,A.D. 1540.,justice over the offending clergy. For this the Archbishop of Braga
14539,A.D. 1540.,"excommunicated Gonzalo Mendez, the chancellor; and Honorius, the pope,"
14540,A.D. 1540.,"excommunicated the king, and put his dominions under an interdict. The"
14541,A.D. 1540.,"exterior offices of religion were suspended, the people fell into the"
14542,A.D. 1540.,"utmost dissoluteness of manners; Mohammedanism made great advances, and"
14543,A.D. 1540.,public confusion everywhere prevailed. By this policy the Church
14544,A.D. 1540.,constrained the nobility to urge the king to a full submission to the
14545,A.D. 1540.,papal chair. While a negotiation for this purpose was on foot Alonzo
14546,A.D. 1540.,"died, and left his son to struggle with an enraged and powerful clergy."
14547,A.D. 1540.,"Don Sancho was just, affable, brave, and an enamoured husband. On this"
14548,A.D. 1540.,last virtue faction first fixed its envenomed fangs. The queen was
14549,A.D. 1540.,"accused of arbitrary influence over her husband; and, according to the"
14550,A.D. 1540.,"superstition of that age, she was believed to have disturbed his senses"
14551,A.D. 1540.,by an enchanted draught. Such of the nobility as declared in the king's
14552,A.D. 1540.,"favour were stigmatized, and rendered odious, as the creatures of the"
14553,A.D. 1540.,"queen. The confusions which ensued were fomented by Alonso, Earl of"
14554,A.D. 1540.,"Bologna, the king's brother, by whom the king was accused as the author"
14555,A.D. 1540.,"of them. In short, by the assistance of the clergy and Pope Innocent"
14556,A.D. 1540.,"IV., Sancho was deposed, and soon after died at Toledo. The beautiful"
14557,A.D. 1540.,"queen, Donna Mencia, was seized upon, and conveyed away by one Raymond"
14558,A.D. 1540.,"Portocarrero, and was never heard of more. Such are the triumphs of"

14635,A.D. 1540.,"fidelity less remarkable than the ardour of his passion. Afraid,"
14636,A.D. 1540.,"however, of his father's resentment, the severity of whose temper he"
14637,A.D. 1540.,"knew, his intercourse with Donna Inez passed at the court as an intrigue"
14638,A.D. 1540.,of gallantry. On the accession of Don Pedro the Cruel to the throne of
14639,A.D. 1540.,Castile many of the disgusted nobility were kindly received by Don
14640,A.D. 1540.,"Pedro, through the interest of his beloved Inez. The favour shown to"
14641,A.D. 1540.,these Castilians gave great uneasiness to the politicians. A thousand
14642,A.D. 1540.,evils were foreseen from the prince's attachment to his Castilian
14643,A.D. 1540.,"mistress: even the murder of his children by his deceased spouse, the"
14644,A.D. 1540.,"princess Constantia, was surmised; and the enemies of Donna Inez,"
14645,A.D. 1540.,"finding the king willing to listen, omitted no opportunity to increase"
14646,A.D. 1540.,his resentment against the unfortunate lady. The prince was about his
14647,A.D. 1540.,twenty-eighth year when his amour with his beloved Inez commenced.

14661,A.D. 1540.,"occasion is fond of expressing his admiration of music, particularly of"
14662,A.D. 1540.,"the song of the nightingale, and the full woodland choir. If in the same"
14663,A.D. 1540.,"manner we are to judge of the favourite taste of Homer, we shall find it"
14664,A.D. 1540.,"of a less delicate kind. He is continually describing the feast, the"
14665,A.D. 1540.,"huge chine, the savoury viands on the glowing coals, and the foaming"
14666,A.D. 1540.,bowl. The ruling passion of Camoëns is also strongly marked in his
14667,A.D. 1540.,"writings. One may venture to affirm, that there is no poem of equal"
14668,A.D. 1540.,length that abounds with so many impassioned encomiums on the fair sex
14669,A.D. 1540.,as the Lusiad. The genius of Camoëns seems never so pleased as when he
14670,A.D. 1540.,is painting the variety of female charms; he feels all the magic of
14671,A.D. 1540.,"their allurements, and riots in his descriptions of the happiness and"
14672,A.D. 1540.,miseries attendant on the passion of love. As he wrote from his
14673,A.D. 1540.,"feelings, these parts of his works have been particularly honoured with"
14674,A.D. 1540.,the attention of the world.

14676,A.D. 1540.,[261] To give the character of Alphonso IV. will throw light on this
14677,A.D. 1540.,"inhuman transaction. He was an undutiful son, an unnatural brother, and"
14678,A.D. 1540.,"a cruel father, a great and fortunate warrior, diligent in the execution"
14679,A.D. 1540.,"of the laws, and a Macchiavellian politician. His maxim was that of the"
14680,A.D. 1540.,"Jesuits; so that a contemplated good might be attained, he cared not how"
14681,A.D. 1540.,villainous might be the means employed. When the enemies of Inez had
14682,A.D. 1540.,"persuaded him that her death was necessary to the welfare of the state,"
14683,A.D. 1540.,"he took a journey to Coimbra, that he might see the lady, when the"
14684,A.D. 1540.,"prince, his son, was absent on a hunting party. Donna Inez, with her"
14685,A.D. 1540.,"children, threw herself at his feet. The king was moved with the"
14686,A.D. 1540.,"distress of the beautiful suppliant, when his three counsellors, Alvaro"
14687,A.D. 1540.,"Gonsalez, Diego Lopez Pacheco, and Pedro Coello, reproaching him for his"
14688,A.D. 1540.,"disregard to the state, he relapsed to his former resolution. She was"
14689,A.D. 1540.,"then dragged from his presence, and brutally murdered by the hands of"
14690,A.D. 1540.,"his three counsellors, who immediately returned to the king with their"
14691,A.D. 1540.,"daggers reeking with the innocent blood of his daughter-in-law. Alonzo,"
14692,A.D. 1540.,"says La Neufville, avowed the horrid assassination, as if he had done"

14710,A.D. 1540.,"fountain of Amours. According to tradition, it was here that Don Pedro"
14711,A.D. 1540.,"resided with his beloved Inez. The fiction of Camoëns, founded on the"
14712,A.D. 1540.,"popular name of the rivulet, is in the spirit of Homer."
14713,A.D. 1540.,
14714,A.D. 1540.,"[267] When the prince was informed of the death of his beloved Inez, he"
14715,A.D. 1540.,was transported into the most violent fury. He took arms against his
14716,A.D. 1540.,father. The country between the rivers Minho and Doura was laid
14717,A.D. 1540.,"desolate: but, by the interposition of the queen and the Archbishop of"
14718,A.D. 1540.,"Braga, the prince relented, and the further horrors of a civil war were"
14719,A.D. 1540.,"prevented. Don Alonzo was not only reconciled to his son, but laboured"
14720,A.D. 1540.,"by every means to oblige him, and to efface from his memory the injury"
14721,A.D. 1540.,"and insult he had received. The prince, however, still continued to"
14722,A.D. 1540.,discover the strongest marks of affection and grief. When he succeeded
14723,A.D. 1540.,"to the crown, one of his first acts was a treaty with the King of"
14724,A.D. 1540.,"Castile, whereby each monarch engaged to give up such malcontents as"
14725,A.D. 1540.,"should take refuge in each other's dominions. In consequence of this,"
14726,A.D. 1540.,"Pedro Coello and Alvaro Gonsalez, who, on the death of Alonzo had fled"
14727,A.D. 1540.,"to Castile, were sent prisoners to Don Pedro. Diego Pacheco, the third"
14728,A.D. 1540.,"murderer, made his escape. The other two were put to death with the most"
14729,A.D. 1540.,"exquisite tortures, and most justly merited, if torture is in any"
14730,A.D. 1540.,"instance to be allowed. After this the king, Don Pedro, summoned an"
14731,A.D. 1540.,"assembly of the states at Cantanedes. Here, in the presence of the"
14732,A.D. 1540.,"Pope's nuncio, he solemnly swore on the holy Gospels, that having"
14733,A.D. 1540.,"obtained a dispensation from Rome, he had secretly, at Braganza,"
14734,A.D. 1540.,"espoused the Lady Inez de Castro, in the presence of the Bishop of"
14735,A.D. 1540.,"Guarda, and of his master of the wardrobe; both of whom confirmed the"
14736,A.D. 1540.,"truth of the oath. The Pope's Bull, containing the dispensation, was"
14737,A.D. 1540.,"published; the body of Inez was lifted from the grave, was placed on a"
14738,A.D. 1540.,"magnificent throne, and with the proper regalia, crowned Queen of"
14739,A.D. 1540.,"Portugal. The nobility did homage to her skeleton, and kissed the bones"
14740,A.D. 1540.,of her hand. The corpse was then interred at the royal monastery of
14741,A.D. 1540.,"Alcobaca, with a pomp before unknown in Portugal, and with all the"
14742,A.D. 1540.,"honours due to a queen. Her monument is still extant, where her statue"
14743,A.D. 1540.,"is adorned with the diadem and the royal robe. This, with the"
14744,A.D. 1540.,"legitimation of her children, and the care he took of all who had been"
14745,A.D. 1540.,"in her service, consoled him in some degree, and rendered him more"
14746,A.D. 1540.,conversable than he had hitherto been; but the cloud which the death of
14747,A.D. 1540.,"Inez brought over the natural cheerfulness of his temper, was never"
14748,A.D. 1540.,totally dispersed.---- A circumstance strongly characteristic of the
14749,A.D. 1540.,rage of his resentment must not be omitted. When the murderers were
14750,A.D. 1540.,"brought before him, he was so transported with indignation, that he"
14751,A.D. 1540.,struck Pedro Coello several blows on the face with the shaft of his
14752,A.D. 1540.,whip.
14753,A.D. 1540.,
14754,A.D. 1540.,[268] _Pedro the Just._--History cannot afford an instance of any prince
14755,A.D. 1540.,who has a more eminent claim to the title of just than Pedro I. His
14756,A.D. 1540.,"diligence to correct every abuse was indefatigable, and when guilt was"
14757,A.D. 1540.,"proved his justice was inexorable. He was dreadful to the evil, and"
14758,A.D. 1540.,"beloved by the good, for he respected no persons, and his inflexible"
14759,A.D. 1540.,severity never digressed from the line of strict justice. An anecdote or
14760,A.D. 1540.,two will throw some light on his character. A priest having killed a
14761,A.D. 1540.,"mason, the king dissembled his knowledge of the crime, and left the"
14762,A.D. 1540.,"issue to the ecclesiastical court, where the priest was punished by one"
14763,A.D. 1540.,year's suspension from saying mass. The king on this privately ordered
14764,A.D. 1540.,the mason's son to revenge the murder of his father. The young man
14765,A.D. 1540.,"obeyed, was apprehended, and condemned to death. When his sentence was"
14766,A.D. 1540.,"to be confirmed by the king, Pedro enquired, what was the young man's"
14767,A.D. 1540.,"trade. He was answered, that he followed his father's. ""Well then,"" said"
14768,A.D. 1540.,"the king, ""I shall commute his punishment, and interdict him from"
14769,A.D. 1540.,"meddling with stone or mortar for a twelve-month."" After this he fully"
14770,A.D. 1540.,"established the authority of the king's courts over the clergy, whom he"
14771,A.D. 1540.,punished with death when their crimes were capital. When solicited to
14772,A.D. 1540.,"refer the causes of such criminals to a higher tribunal, he would answer"
14773,A.D. 1540.,"very calmly, ""That is what I intend to do: I will send them to the"
14774,A.D. 1540.,"highest of all tribunals, to that of their Maker and mine."" Against"
14775,A.D. 1540.,"adulterers he was particularly severe, often declaring it as his"
14776,A.D. 1540.,"opinion, that conjugal infidelity was the source of the greatest evils,"
14777,A.D. 1540.,and that therefore to restrain it was the interest and duty of the
14778,A.D. 1540.,sovereign. Though the fate of his beloved Inez chagrined and soured his
14779,A.D. 1540.,"temper, he was so far from being naturally sullen or passionate, that he"
14780,A.D. 1540.,was rather of a gay and sprightly disposition; he was affable and easy
14781,A.D. 1540.,"of access; delighted in music and dancing; was a lover of learning, a"
14782,A.D. 1540.,"man of letters, and an elegant poet.--Vide Le Clede, Mariana, Faria."

14787,A.D. 1540.,"privately espoused to her, though, at this time, he was publicly married"
14788,A.D. 1540.,"by proxy to Donna Leonora of Arragon. A dangerous insurrection, headed"
14789,A.D. 1540.,"by one Velasquez, a tailor, drove the king and his adulterous bride from"
14790,A.D. 1540.,"Lisbon. Soon after, he caused his marriage to be publicly celebrated in"
14791,A.D. 1540.,"the province of Entre Douro e Minho. Henry, king of Castile, being"
14792,A.D. 1540.,"informed of the general discontent that reigned in Portugal, marched a"
14793,A.D. 1540.,"formidable army into that kingdom, to revenge the injury offered to some"
14794,A.D. 1540.,"of his subjects, whose ships had been unjustly seized at Lisbon. The"
14795,A.D. 1540.,desolation hinted at by Camoëns ensued. After the subjects of both

14837,A.D. 1540.,"sister, Donna Maria, a lady of unblemished virtue, had been secretly"
14838,A.D. 1540.,"married to the infant, Don Juan, the king's brother, who was"
14839,A.D. 1540.,passionately attached to her. Donna Maria had formerly endeavoured to
14840,A.D. 1540.,dissuade her sister from the adulterous marriage with the king. In
14841,A.D. 1540.,"revenge of this, the queen, Leonora, persuaded Don Juan that her sister"
14842,A.D. 1540.,"was unfaithful to his bed. The enraged husband hastened to his wife,"
14843,A.D. 1540.,"and, without enquiry or expostulation, says Mariana, dispatched her with"
14844,A.D. 1540.,two strokes of his dagger. He was afterwards convinced of her innocence.
14845,A.D. 1540.,"Having sacrificed her honour, and her first husband, to a king, (says"

14847,A.D. 1540.,"Castilian nobleman, named Don Juan Fernandez de Andeyro. An unjust war"
14848,A.D. 1540.,"with Castile, wherein the Portuguese were defeated by sea and land, was"
14849,A.D. 1540.,the first fruits of the policy of the new favourite. Andeyro one day
14850,A.D. 1540.,"being in a great perspiration, by some military exercise, the queen tore"
14851,A.D. 1540.,"her veil, and publicly gave it him to wipe his face. The grand master of"
14852,A.D. 1540.,"Avis, the king's illegitimate brother, afterwards John I., and some"
14853,A.D. 1540.,"others, expostulated with her on the indecency of this behaviour. She"
14854,A.D. 1540.,"dissembled her resentment, but, soon after, they were seized and"
14855,A.D. 1540.,"committed to the castle of Evora, where a forged order for their"
14856,A.D. 1540.,"execution was sent; but the governor suspecting some fraud, showed it to"
14857,A.D. 1540.,"the king. Yet, such was her ascendancy over Fernando, that though"
14858,A.D. 1540.,"convinced of her guilt, he ordered his brother to kiss the queen's hand,"
14859,A.D. 1540.,"and thank her for his life. Soon after, Fernando died, but not till he"
14860,A.D. 1540.,"was fully convinced of the queen's conjugal infidelity, and had given an"
14861,A.D. 1540.,order for the assassination of the gallant. Not long after the death of
14862,A.D. 1540.,"the king, the favourite Andeyro was stabbed in the palace by the"
14863,A.D. 1540.,"grandmaster of Avis, and Don Ruy de Pereyra. The queen expressed all the"
14864,A.D. 1540.,"transport of grief and rage, and declared she would undergo the"
14865,A.D. 1540.,"trial-ordeal in vindication of his, and her, innocence. But this she"
14866,A.D. 1540.,"never performed: in her vows of revenge, however, she was more punctual."
14867,A.D. 1540.,"Don Juan, king of Castile, who had married her only daughter and"
14868,A.D. 1540.,"heiress, at her earnest entreaties invaded Portugal, and was proclaimed"
14869,A.D. 1540.,"king. Don John, grand master of Avis, was proclaimed by the people"
14870,A.D. 1540.,"protector and regent. A desperate war ensued. Queen Leonora, treated"
14871,A.D. 1540.,"with indifference by her daughter and son-in-law, resolved on the murder"
14872,A.D. 1540.,"of the latter, but the plot was discovered, and she was sent prisoner to"
14873,A.D. 1540.,"Castile. The regent was besieged in Lisbon, and the city reduced to the"
14874,A.D. 1540.,"utmost extremities, when an epidemic broke out in the Castilian army,"
14875,A.D. 1540.,"and made such devastation, that the king suddenly raised the siege, and"
14876,A.D. 1540.,abandoned his views on Portugal. The happy inhabitants ascribed their
14877,A.D. 1540.,deliverance to the valour and vigilance of the regent. The regent
14878,A.D. 1540.,"reproved their ardour, exhorted them to repair to their churches, and"

14880,A.D. 1540.,safety. This behaviour increased the admiration of the people; the
14881,A.D. 1540.,"nobility of the first rank joined the regent's party, and many garrisons"
14882,A.D. 1540.,in the interest of the king of Castile opened their gates to him. An
14883,A.D. 1540.,"assembly of the states met at Coimbra, where it was proposed to invest"
14884,A.D. 1540.,the regent with the regal dignity. This he pretended to decline. Don
14885,A.D. 1540.,"John, son of Pedro the Just and the beautiful Inez de Castro, was by the"
14886,A.D. 1540.,"people esteemed their lawful sovereign, but was, and had been long,"
14887,A.D. 1540.,detained a prisoner by the King of Castile. If the states would declare
14888,A.D. 1540.,"the infant, Don John, their king, the regent professed his willingness"
14889,A.D. 1540.,"to swear allegiance to him, that he would continue to expose himself to"
14890,A.D. 1540.,"every danger, and act as regent, till Providence restored to Portugal"
14891,A.D. 1540.,"her lawful sovereign. The states, however, saw the necessity that the"
14892,A.D. 1540.,"nation should have a head. The regent was unanimously elected king, and"
14893,A.D. 1540.,some articles in favour of liberty were added to those agreed upon at
14894,A.D. 1540.,"the coronation of Don Alonzo Enriquez, the first king of Portugal."
14895,A.D. 1540.,
14896,A.D. 1540.,"Don John I., one of the greatest of the Portuguese monarchs, was the"
14897,A.D. 1540.,"natural son of Pedro the Just, by Donna Teresa Lorenza, a Galician lady,"
14898,A.D. 1540.,and was born some years after the death of Inez. At seven years of age
14899,A.D. 1540.,"he was made grand master of Avis, where he received an excellent"
14900,A.D. 1540.,"education, which, joined to his great parts, brought him out early on"
14901,A.D. 1540.,"the political theatre. He was a brave commander, and a deep politician,"
14902,A.D. 1540.,yet never forfeited the character of candour and honour. To be humble to
14903,A.D. 1540.,"his friends, and haughty to his enemies, was his leading maxim. His"
14904,A.D. 1540.,prudence gained him the confidence of the wise; his steadiness and
14905,A.D. 1540.,gratitude the friendship of the brave; his liberality the bulk of the
14906,A.D. 1540.,people. He was in the twenty-seventh year of his age when declared

14976,A.D. 1540.,"mistaken. Don Alonzo Enriquez, the first King of Portugal, was elected"
14977,A.D. 1540.,"by the people, who had recovered their liberties at the glorious battle"
14978,A.D. 1540.,of Ourique. At the election the constitution of the kingdom was settled
14979,A.D. 1540.,"in eighteen short statutes, wherein it is expressly provided, that none"
14980,A.D. 1540.,but a Portuguese can be king of Portugal; that if an infanta marry a
14981,A.D. 1540.,"foreign prince, he shall not, in her right, become King of Portugal, and"
14982,A.D. 1540.,"a new election of a king, in case of the failure of the male line, is,"
14983,A.D. 1540.,"by these statutes, supposed legal. By the treaty of marriage between the"
14984,A.D. 1540.,"King of Castile and Donna Beatrix, the heiress of Fernando of Portugal,"
14985,A.D. 1540.,"it was agreed, that only their children should succeed to the Portuguese"
14986,A.D. 1540.,"crown; and that, in case the throne became vacant ere such children were"
14987,A.D. 1540.,"born, the Queen-dowager, Leonora, should govern with the title of"
14988,A.D. 1540.,"Regent. Thus, neither by the original constitution, nor by the treaty of"
14989,A.D. 1540.,"marriage, could the King of Castile succeed to the throne of Portugal."
14990,A.D. 1540.,And any pretence he might found on the marriage contract was already
14991,A.D. 1540.,"forfeited; for he caused himself and his queen to be proclaimed, added"
14992,A.D. 1540.,"Portugal to his titles, coined Portuguese money with his bust, deposed"
14993,A.D. 1540.,"the queen regent, and afterwards sent her prisoner to Castile. The"
14994,A.D. 1540.,"lawful heir, Don Juan, the son of Inez de Castro, was kept in prison by"
14995,A.D. 1540.,"his rival, the King of Castile; and, as before observed, a new election"
14996,A.D. 1540.,"was, by the original statutes, supposed legal in cases of emergency."
14997,A.D. 1540.,"These facts, added to the consideration of the tyranny of the King of"

15109,A.D. 1540.,"conduct when regent, have already been mentioned. The same justice,"
15110,A.D. 1540.,"prudence, and heroism always accompanied him when king. He had the art"
15111,A.D. 1540.,to join the most winning affability with all the manly dignity of the
15112,A.D. 1540.,"sovereign. To those who were his friends, when a private man, he was"
15113,A.D. 1540.,"particularly attentive. His nobility dined at his table, he frequently"
15114,A.D. 1540.,"made visits to them, and introduced among them the taste for, and the"
15115,A.D. 1540.,"love of, letters. As he felt the advantages of education, he took the"
15116,A.D. 1540.,"utmost care of that of his children. He had many sons, and he himself"
15117,A.D. 1540.,"often instructed them in solid and useful knowledge, and was amply"
15118,A.D. 1540.,"repaid. He lived to see them men, men of parts and of action, whose only"
15119,A.D. 1540.,"emulation was to show affection to his person, and to support his"
15120,A.D. 1540.,"administration by their great abilities. One of his sons, Don Henry,"
15121,A.D. 1540.,"duke of Viseo, was that great prince whose ardent passion for maritime"
15122,A.D. 1540.,affairs gave birth to all the modern improvements in navigation. The
15123,A.D. 1540.,"clergy, who had disturbed almost every other reign, were so convinced of"
15124,A.D. 1540.,"the wisdom of his, that they confessed he ought to be supported out of"
15125,A.D. 1540.,"the treasures of the church, and granted him the church plate to be"
15126,A.D. 1540.,coined. When the pope ordered a rigorous inquiry to be made into his
15127,A.D. 1540.,"having brought ecclesiastics before lay tribunals, the clergy had the"
15128,A.D. 1540.,"singular honesty to desert what was styled the church immunities, and to"
15129,A.D. 1540.,own that justice had been impartially administered. He died in the
15130,A.D. 1540.,"seventy-sixth year of his age, and in the forty-eighth of his reign. His"
15131,A.D. 1540.,"affection to his queen, Philippa, made him fond of the English, whose"

15135,A.D. 1540.,"at the other's expense, to give his poem an air of solemnity. The siege"
15136,A.D. 1540.,of Tangier was proposed. The king's brothers differed in their opinions:
15137,A.D. 1540.,"that of Don Fernand, though a knight-errant adventure, was approved of"
15138,A.D. 1540.,"by the young nobility. The infants, Henry and Fernand, at the head of"
15139,A.D. 1540.,"7000 men, laid siege to Tangier, and were surrounded by a numerous army"
15140,A.D. 1540.,"of Moors, some writers say six hundred thousand. On condition that the"
15141,A.D. 1540.,"Portuguese army should be allowed to return home, the infants promised"
15142,A.D. 1540.,"to surrender Ceuta. The Moors gladly accepted of the terms, but demanded"
15143,A.D. 1540.,"one of the infants as a hostage. Fernand offered himself, and was left."
15144,A.D. 1540.,"The king was willing to comply with the terms to relieve his brother,"
15145,A.D. 1540.,"but the court considered the value of Ceuta, and would not consent. The"
15146,A.D. 1540.,"pope also interposed his authority, that Ceuta should be kept as a check"
15147,A.D. 1540.,"on the infidels, and proposed to raise a crusade for the delivery of"
15148,A.D. 1540.,Fernand. In the meanwhile large offers were made for his liberty. These
15149,A.D. 1540.,"were rejected by the Moors, who would accept of nothing but Ceuta, to"
15150,A.D. 1540.,"whose vast importance they were no strangers. When negotiations failed,"
15151,A.D. 1540.,"King Edward assembled a large army to effect his brother's release, but,"
15152,A.D. 1540.,"just as he was setting out, he was seized with the plague, and died,"
15153,A.D. 1540.,leaving orders with his queen to deliver up Ceuta for the release of his
15154,A.D. 1540.,"brother. This, however, was never performed. Don Fernand remained with"
15155,A.D. 1540.,the Moors till his death. The magnanimity of his behaviour gained him
15156,A.D. 1540.,"their esteem and admiration, nor is there good proof that he received"
15157,A.D. 1540.,any very rigorous treatment; the contrary is rather to be inferred from
15158,A.D. 1540.,the romantic notions of military honour which then prevailed among the
15159,A.D. 1540.,Moors. Don Fernand is to this day esteemed as a saint and martyr in
15160,A.D. 1540.,"Portugal, and his memory is commemorated on the fifth of June. King"
15161,A.D. 1540.,Edward reigned only five years and a month. He was the most eloquent man
15162,A.D. 1540.,"in his dominions, spoke and wrote Latin elegantly, was author of several"
15163,A.D. 1540.,"books, one on horsemanship, in which art he excelled. He was brave in"
15164,A.D. 1540.,"the field, active in business, and rendered his country infinite service"
15165,A.D. 1540.,by reducing the laws to a regular code. He was knight of the Order of
15166,A.D. 1540.,"the Garter, which honour was conferred upon him by his cousin, Henry V."
15167,A.D. 1540.,of England. In one instance he gave great offence to the superstitious
15168,A.D. 1540.,"populace. He despised the advice of a Jew astrologer, who entreated him"
15169,A.D. 1540.,to delay his coronation because the stars that day were unfavourable. To
15170,A.D. 1540.,"this the misfortune of Tangier was ascribed, and the people were always"

15246,A.D. 1540.,Emmanuel's council were almost unanimous against the attempt. Some
15247,A.D. 1540.,"dreaded the introduction of wealth, and its attendants, luxury and"
15248,A.D. 1540.,"effeminacy; while others affirmed, that no adequate advantages could"

15389,A.D. 1540.,"assumed the figure of that goddess, completed his amorous desires. On"
15390,A.D. 1540.,"the discovery of her pregnancy, Diana drove her from her train. She fled"
15391,A.D. 1540.,"to the woods, where she was delivered of a son. Juno changed them into"
15392,A.D. 1540.,"bears, and Jupiter placed them in heaven, where they form the"
15393,A.D. 1540.,"constellations of Ursa Major and Minor. Juno, still enraged, entreated"
15394,A.D. 1540.,Thetis never to suffer Calisto to bathe in the sea. This is founded on
15395,A.D. 1540.,"the appearance of the northern pole-star, to the inhabitants of our"

15463,A.D. 1540.,"with a red cap, some glasses and bells, induced him to bring a number of"
15464,A.D. 1540.,his companions for the like trifles. Though some who accompanied GAMA
15465,A.D. 1540.,"were skilled in the various African languages, not one of the natives"
15466,A.D. 1540.,"could understand them. A commerce, however, was commenced by signs and"
15467,A.D. 1540.,gestures. GAMA behaved to them with great civility; the fleet was
15468,A.D. 1540.,"cheerfully supplied with fresh provisions, for which the natives"
15469,A.D. 1540.,received cloths and trinkets. But this friendship was soon interrupted
15470,A.D. 1540.,"by a young, rash Portuguese. Having contracted an intimacy with some of"
15471,A.D. 1540.,"the negroes, he obtained leave to penetrate into the country along with"
15472,A.D. 1540.,"them, to observe their habitations and strength. They conducted him to"
15473,A.D. 1540.,"their huts with great good nature, and placed before him, what they"
15474,A.D. 1540.,"esteemed an elegant repast, a sea-calf dressed in the way of their"
15475,A.D. 1540.,"country. This so much disgusted the delicate Portuguese, that he"
15476,A.D. 1540.,instantly got up and abruptly left them. Nor did they oppose his
15477,A.D. 1540.,"departure, but accompanied him with the greatest innocence. As fear,"
15478,A.D. 1540.,"however, is always jealous, he imagined they were leading him as a"
15479,A.D. 1540.,"victim to slaughter. No sooner did he come near the ships, than he"
15480,A.D. 1540.,called aloud for assistance. Coëllo's boat immediately set off for his
15481,A.D. 1540.,rescue. The Africans fled to the woods; and now esteeming the Portuguese
15482,A.D. 1540.,"as a band of lawless plunderers, they provided themselves with arms, and"
15483,A.D. 1540.,"lay in ambush. Their weapons were javelins, headed with short pieces of"
15484,A.D. 1540.,"horn, which they throw with great dexterity. Soon after, while GAMA and"
15485,A.D. 1540.,some of his officers were on the shore taking the altitude of the sun by
15486,A.D. 1540.,"the astrolabe, they were suddenly and with great fury attacked by the"
15487,A.D. 1540.,"ambush from the woods. Several were much wounded, _multos convulnerant,"
15488,A.D. 1540.,"inter quos Gama in pede vulnus accepit_, and GAMA received a wound in"
15489,A.D. 1540.,"the foot. The admiral made a speedy retreat to the fleet, prudently"
15490,A.D. 1540.,"choosing rather to leave the negroes the honour of the victory, than to"
15491,A.D. 1540.,risk the life of one man in a quarrel so foreign to the destination of
15492,A.D. 1540.,"his expedition, and where, to impress the terror of his arms could be of"
15493,A.D. 1540.,no service to his interest. When he came nearer to the East Indies he
15494,A.D. 1540.,acted in a different manner. He then made himself dreaded whenever the
15495,A.D. 1540.,treachery of the natives provoked his resentment.--_Collected from_

15670,A.D. 1540.,epopea required to be ascribed to them. History relates the matter
15671,A.D. 1540.,"differently. In standing for the Cape of Good Hope, GAMA gave the"
15672,A.D. 1540.,highest proofs of his resolution. The fleet seemed now tossed to the
15673,A.D. 1540.,"clouds, _ut modo nubes contingere_, and now sunk to the lowest"
15674,A.D. 1540.,"whirlpools of the abyss. The winds were insufferably cold, and, to the"
15675,A.D. 1540.,rage of the tempest was added the horror of an almost continual
15676,A.D. 1540.,darkness. The crew expected every moment to be swallowed up in the deep.
15677,A.D. 1540.,"At every interval of the storm, they came round GAMA, asserting the"

15805,A.D. 1540.,Their good offices were reciprocal. By the information of the King of

15816,A.D. 1540.,in conferring the most beneficial gift on mankind. Neptune struck the
15817,A.D. 1540.,"earth with his trident and produced the horse, whose bounding motions"
15818,A.D. 1540.,are emblematical of the agitation of the sea. Pallas commanded the
15819,A.D. 1540.,"olive-tree, the symbol of peace, and of riches, to spring forth. The"
15820,A.D. 1540.,"victory was adjudged to the goddess, from whom the city was named"
15821,A.D. 1540.,Athens. The taste of the ancient Grecians clothed almost every
15822,A.D. 1540.,"occurrence in mythological allegory. The founders of Athens, it is most"
15823,A.D. 1540.,"probable, disputed whether their new city should be named from the"
15824,A.D. 1540.,fertility of the soil or from the marine situation of Attica. The former
15825,A.D. 1540.,"opinion prevailed, and the town received its name in honour of the"
15826,A.D. 1540.,goddess of the olive-tree--_Ath{=e}n{=e}_.

15830,A.D. 1540.,"with her lance. That she waved her hand while the olive boughs spread,"
15831,A.D. 1540.,"is a fine poetical attitude, and varies the picture from that of"

15839,A.D. 1540.,merit. Nothing can be more in place than the picture of chaos and the
15840,A.D. 1540.,"four elements. The war of the gods, and the contest of Neptune and"
15841,A.D. 1540.,Minerva are touched with the true boldness of poetical colouring. To

15855,A.D. 1540.,"fable of Triton, it is probable, was founded on the appearance of a sea"
15856,A.D. 1540.,"animal, which, according to some ancient naturalists, in the upward"
15857,A.D. 1540.,parts resembles the human figure. Pausanias relates a wonderful story of
15858,A.D. 1540.,"a monstrously large one, which often came ashore on the meadows of"
15859,A.D. 1540.,"Boeotia. Over his head was a kind of finny cartilage, which, at a"
15860,A.D. 1540.,"distance, appeared like hair; the body covered with brown scales; the"
15861,A.D. 1540.,"nose and ears like the human; the mouth of a dreadful width, jagged with"
15862,A.D. 1540.,the teeth of a panther; the eyes of a greenish hue; the hands divided
15863,A.D. 1540.,"into fingers, the nails of which were crooked, and of a shelly"
15864,A.D. 1540.,"substance. This monster, whose extremities ended in a tail like a"
15865,A.D. 1540.,"dolphin's, devoured both men and beasts as they chanced in his way. The"
15866,A.D. 1540.,"citizens of Tanagra, at last, contrived his destruction. They set a"
15867,A.D. 1540.,"large vessel full of wine on the sea shore. Triton got drunk with it,"
15868,A.D. 1540.,"and fell into a profound sleep, in which condition the Tanagrians"
15869,A.D. 1540.,"beheaded him, and afterwards, with great propriety, hung up his body in"

15897,A.D. 1540.,"and drove the mother and her other son, Melicertus, into the sea. The"

15979,MILTON.,"which the dames complained. It must, however, he adds, have been such as"

15987,MILTON.,"field, in which he has admirably succeeded, without prejudice to the"

16049,MILTON.,"vassals. Isabella, who was present, solemnly protested that the earls of"
16050,MILTON.,"Flanders were not obliged to do homage. A dispute arose, on which she"
16051,MILTON.,"offered, according to the custom of that age, to appeal to the fate of"
16052,MILTON.,"arms. The proposal was accepted, and Magricio the champion of Isabella,"

16054,MILTON.,"do not mention this adventure, and though Emmanuel de Faria, and the"
16055,MILTON.,"best Portuguese writers treat it with doubt, nothing to the disadvantage"
16056,MILTON.,of Camoëns is thence to be inferred. A poet is not obliged always to

16059,MILTON.,"[431] _The Rhine another pass'd, and prov'd his might._--This was Alvaro"

16061,MILTON.,"received from a German a challenge to measure swords, on condition that"
16062,MILTON.,each should fight with the right side unarmed; the German by this hoping
16063,MILTON.,"to be victorious, for he was left-handed. The Portuguese, suspecting no"
16064,MILTON.,"fraud, accepted. When the combat began he perceived the inequality. His"
16065,MILTON.,"right side unarmed was exposed to the enemy, whose left side, which was"
16066,MILTON.,nearest to him was defended with half a cuirass. Notwithstanding all
16067,MILTON.,"this, the brave Alvaro obtained the victory. He sprang upon the German,"
16068,MILTON.,"seized him, and, grasping him forcibly in his arms, stifled and crushed"
16069,MILTON.,"him to death; imitating the conduct of Hercules, who in the same manner"
16070,MILTON.,slew the cruel Anteus. Here we ought to remark the address of our
16071,MILTON.,author; he describes at length the injury and grief of the English
16072,MILTON.,"ladies, the voyage of the twelve champions to England, and the prowess"
16073,MILTON.,"they there displayed. When Veloso relates these, the sea is calm; but no"
16074,MILTON.,"sooner does it begin to be troubled, than the soldier abridges his"
16075,MILTON.,"recital: we see him follow by degrees the preludes of the storm, we"
16076,MILTON.,"perceive the anxiety of his mind on the view of the approaching danger,"
16077,MILTON.,hastening his narration to an end. Behold the strokes of a
16078,MILTON.,"master!--_This note, and the one preceding, are from Castera._"
16079,MILTON.,
16080,MILTON.,"[432] _The halcyons, mindful of their fate, deplore._--Ceyx, king of"
16081,MILTON.,"Trachinia, son of Lucifer, married Alcyone, the daughter of Eolus. On a"
16082,MILTON.,"voyage to consult the Delphic Oracle, he was shipwrecked. His corpse was"
16083,MILTON.,"thrown ashore in the view of his spouse, who, in the agonies of her love"
16084,MILTON.,"and despair, threw herself into the sea. The gods, in pity of her pious"
16085,MILTON.,"fidelity, metamorphosed them into the birds which bear her name. The"
16086,MILTON.,"halcyon is a little bird about the size of a thrush, its plumage of a"
16087,MILTON.,"beautiful sky blue, mixed with some traits of white and carnation. It is"
16088,MILTON.,vulgarly called the kingfisher. The halcyons very seldom appear but in
16089,MILTON.,"the finest weather, whence they are fabled to build their nests on the"
16090,MILTON.,"waves. The female is no less remarkable than the turtle, for her"
16091,MILTON.,"conjugal affection. She nourishes and attends the male when sick, and"
16092,MILTON.,survives his death but a few days. When the halcyons are surprised in a
16093,MILTON.,"tempest, they fly about as in the utmost terror, with the most"
16094,MILTON.,"lamentable and doleful cries. To introduce them, therefore, in the"
16095,MILTON.,"picture of a storm is a proof, both of the taste and judgment of"
16096,MILTON.,Camoëns.
16097,MILTON.,
16098,MILTON.,"[433] _With shrill, faint voice, th' untimely ghost complains._--It may"
16099,MILTON.,not perhaps be unentertaining to cite Madame Dacier and Mr. Pope on the
16100,MILTON.,"voices of the dead. It will, at least, afford a critical observation"
16101,MILTON.,"which appears to have escaped them both. ""The shades of the suitors,"""
16102,MILTON.,"observes Dacier, ""when they are summoned by Mercury out of the palace of"
16103,MILTON.,"Ulysses, emit a feeble, plaintive, inarticulate sound, [Greek:"
16104,MILTON.,"trizousi], strident: whereas Agamemnon, and the shades that have been"
16105,MILTON.,"long in the state of the dead, speak articulately. I doubt not but Homer"
16106,MILTON.,"intended to show, by the former description, that when the soul is"
16107,MILTON.,"separated from the organs of the body, it ceases to act after the same"
16108,MILTON.,manner as while it was joined to it; but how the dead recover their
16109,MILTON.,voices afterwards is not easy to understand. In other respects Virgil
16110,MILTON.,paints after Homer:--
16111,MILTON.,
16112,MILTON.,_Pars tollere vocem
16113,MILTON.,"Exiguam: inceptus clamor frustratur hiantes.""_"
16114,MILTON.,
16115,MILTON.,"To this Mr. Pope replies, ""But why should we suppose, with Dacier, that"
16116,MILTON.,these shades of the suitors (of Penelope) have lost the faculty of
16117,MILTON.,speaking? I rather imagine that the sounds they uttered were signs of
16118,MILTON.,"complaint and discontent, and proceeded not from an inability to speak."
16119,MILTON.,"After Patroclus was slain he appears to Achilles, and speaks very"
16120,MILTON.,"articulately to him; yet, to express his sorrow at his departure, he"
16121,MILTON.,acts like these suitors: for Achilles--
16122,MILTON.,
16123,MILTON.,"'Like a thin smoke beholds the spirit fly,"
16124,MILTON.,"And hears a feeble, lamentable cry.'"
16125,MILTON.,
16126,MILTON.,"Dacier conjectures that the power of speech ceases in the dead, till"
16127,MILTON.,they are admitted into a state of rest; but Patroclus is an instance to
16128,MILTON.,"the contrary in the Iliad, and Elpenor in the Odyssey, for they both"
16129,MILTON.,"speak before their funereal rites are performed, and consequently before"
16130,MILTON.,"they enter into a state of repose amongst the shades of the happy."""
16131,MILTON.,
16132,MILTON.,"The critic, in his search for distant proofs, often omits the most"
16133,MILTON.,material one immediately at hand. Had Madame Dacier attended to the
16134,MILTON.,"episode of the souls of the suitors, the world had never seen her"
16135,MILTON.,ingenuity in these mythological conjectures; nor had Mr. Pope any need
16136,MILTON.,to bring the case of Patroclus or Elpenor to overthrow her system.
16137,MILTON.,"Amphimedon, one of the suitors, in the very episode which gave birth to"
16138,MILTON.,"Dacier's conjecture, tells his story very articulately to the shade of"
16139,MILTON.,"Agamemnon, though he had not received the funereal rites:--"

16141,MILTON.,"""Our mangled bodies, now deform'd with gore,"

16150,ODYS. XXIV.,"everything in it, as Aristotle says of the Iliad, has manners; poetry"
16151,ODYS. XXIV.,must therefore personify according to our ideas. Thus in Milton:--

16153,ODYS. XXIV.,"""Tears, such as angels weep, burst forth."""
16154,ODYS. XXIV.,
16155,ODYS. XXIV.,"And thus in Homer, while the suitors are conducted to hell:--"
16156,ODYS. XXIV.,

16158,ODYS. XXIV.,"Thin, hollow screams, along the deep descent:"""
16159,ODYS. XXIV.,

16176,ODYS. XXIV.,
16177,ODYS. XXIV.,In innumerable instances Camoëns discovers himself a judicious imitator
16178,ODYS. XXIV.,of the ancients. In the two great masters of the epic are several
16179,ODYS. XXIV.,"prophecies oracular of the fate of different heroes, which give an air"
16180,ODYS. XXIV.,of solemn importance to the poem. The fate of the Armada thus obscurely
16181,ODYS. XXIV.,"anticipated, resembles in particular the prophecy of the safe return of"
16182,ODYS. XXIV.,"Ulysses to Ithaca, foretold by the shade of Tiresias, which was"
16183,ODYS. XXIV.,afterwards fulfilled by the Phæacians. It remains now to make some
16184,ODYS. XXIV.,observations on the machinery used by Camoëns in this book. The
16185,ODYS. XXIV.,"necessity of machinery in the epopea, and the, perhaps, insurmountable"
16186,ODYS. XXIV.,difficulty of finding one unexceptionably adapted to a poem where the
16187,ODYS. XXIV.,"heroes are Christians, or, in other words, to a poem whose subject is"
16188,ODYS. XXIV.,"modern, have already been observed in the preface. The machinery of"
16189,ODYS. XXIV.,"Camoëns has also been proved, in every respect, to be less exceptionable"
16190,ODYS. XXIV.,"than that of Tasso in his Jerusalem, or that of Voltaire in his"
16191,ODYS. XXIV.,"Henriade. The descent of Bacchus to the palace of Neptune, in the depths"
16192,ODYS. XXIV.,"of the sea, and his address to the watery gods, are noble imitations of"
16193,ODYS. XXIV.,Virgil's Juno in the first Æneid. The description of the storm is also
16194,ODYS. XXIV.,masterly. In both instances the conduct of the Æneid is joined with the
16195,ODYS. XXIV.,descriptive exuberance of the Odyssey. The appearance of the star of
16196,ODYS. XXIV.,Venus through the storm is finely imagined; the influence of the nymphs
16197,ODYS. XXIV.,"of that goddess over the winds, and their subsequent nuptials, are in"
16198,ODYS. XXIV.,the spirit of the promise of Juno to Eolus:--

16469,ODYS. XXIV.,"become visible, became man. In this state he produced three sons, Mayso,"
16470,ODYS. XXIV.,"Visnu, and Brahma; the first, born of his mouth, the second, of his"
16471,ODYS. XXIV.,"breast, the third, of his belly. Being about to return to his"
16472,ODYS. XXIV.,"invisibility, he assigned various departments to his three sons. To"
16473,ODYS. XXIV.,"Brahma he gave the third heaven, with the superintendence of the rites"
16474,ODYS. XXIV.,"of religion. Brahma having a desire for children, begat the Brahmins,"
16475,ODYS. XXIV.,"who are the priests of India, and who are believed by the other tribes"
16476,ODYS. XXIV.,"to be a race of demi-gods, who have the blood of heaven running in their"

16480,ODYS. XXIV.,According to the learned Kircher's account of the theology of the
16481,ODYS. XXIV.,"Brahmins, the sole and supreme god Vishnu, formed the secondary god"
16482,ODYS. XXIV.,"Brahma, out of a flower that floated on the surface of the great deep"
16483,ODYS. XXIV.,"before the creation. And afterwards, in reward of the virtue, fidelity,"
16484,ODYS. XXIV.,"and gratitude of Brahma, gave him power to create the universe."

16486,ODYS. XXIV.,"Hesiod's genealogy of the gods, though refined upon by the schools of"

16488,ODYS. XXIV.,"The Jewish fables, foolish questions and genealogies, reproved by Saint"
16489,ODYS. XXIV.,"Paul (epist. Tit.), were probably of this kind, for the Talmudical"
16490,ODYS. XXIV.,"legends were not then sprung up. _Binah_, or Understanding, said the"
16491,ODYS. XXIV.,"cabalists, begat _Kochmah_, or Wisdom, etc., till at last comes"
16492,ODYS. XXIV.,"_Milcah_, the Kingdom, who begat _Shekinah_, the Divine Presence. In the"
16493,ODYS. XXIV.,"same manner the Christian Gnostics, of the sect of Valentinus, held"
16494,ODYS. XXIV.,"their [Greek: Plêrôma], and their thirty Æons. _Ampsiu_ and _Auraan_,"
16495,ODYS. XXIV.,"they tell us, _i.e._ Profundity and Silence, begat _Bacua_ and"
16496,ODYS. XXIV.,"_Tharthuu_, Mind and Truth; these begat _Ubucua_ and _Thardeadie_, Word"
16497,ODYS. XXIV.,"and Life, and these _Merexa_ and _Atarbarba_, Man and Church. The other"
16498,ODYS. XXIV.,conjunctions of their thirty Æons are of similar ingenuity. The
16499,ODYS. XXIV.,prevalence of the same spirit of mythological allegory in such different
16500,ODYS. XXIV.,"nations, affords the philosopher a worthy field for speculation."
16501,ODYS. XXIV.,
16502,ODYS. XXIV.,Almost as innumerable as their legends are the dreadful penances to
16503,ODYS. XXIV.,which the Hindus submit themselves for the expiation of sins. Some hold
16504,ODYS. XXIV.,"the transmigration of souls, and of consequence abstain from all animal"
16505,ODYS. XXIV.,"food.{*} Yet, however austere in other respects, they freely abandon"
16506,ODYS. XXIV.,"themselves to every species of debauchery, some of them esteeming the"
16507,ODYS. XXIV.,most unnatural abominations as the privilege of their sanctity. The cow
16508,ODYS. XXIV.,"they venerate as sacred. If a dying man can lay hold of a cow's tail,"
16509,ODYS. XXIV.,"and expire with it in his hands, his soul is sure to be purified, and"
16510,ODYS. XXIV.,perhaps will enjoy the signal favour to transmigrate into the body of
16511,ODYS. XXIV.,"one of those animals. The temples of India, which are numerous, are"
16512,ODYS. XXIV.,filled with innumerable idols of the most horrid figures. The Brahmins
16513,ODYS. XXIV.,are allowed to eat nothing but what is cooked by themselves. Astrology
16514,ODYS. XXIV.,"is their principal study; yet, though they are mostly a despicable set"
16515,ODYS. XXIV.,"of fortune-tellers, some of them are excellent moralists, and"
16516,ODYS. XXIV.,"particularly inculcate the comprehensive virtue of humanity, which is"
16517,ODYS. XXIV.,"enforced by the opinion, that Divine beings often assume the habit of"
16518,ODYS. XXIV.,"mendicants, in order to distinguish the charitable from the inhuman."
16519,ODYS. XXIV.,"They have several traditions of the virtuous, on these happy trials,"
16520,ODYS. XXIV.,"being translated into heaven; the best designed incitement to virtue,"
16521,ODYS. XXIV.,"perhaps, which their religion contains. Besides the Brahmins, the"
16522,ODYS. XXIV.,"principal sect of that vast region called India, there are several"
16523,ODYS. XXIV.,"others, who are divided and subdivided, according to innumerable"
16524,ODYS. XXIV.,"variations, in every province. In Cambaya, the Banians, a sect who"
16525,ODYS. XXIV.,"strictly abstain from all animal food, are numerous."
16526,ODYS. XXIV.,
16527,ODYS. XXIV.,"{*} Though from the extracts given by Mr. Dow, the philosopher Goutam"
16528,ODYS. XXIV.,"appears to have been a very Duns Scotus or Aquinas in metaphysics, the"
16529,ODYS. XXIV.,"Pythagorean reason why the Brahmins abstain from animal food, is a"
16530,ODYS. XXIV.,convincing proof of their ignorance in natural philosophy. Some will let
16531,ODYS. XXIV.,"vermin overrun them; some of the Banians cover their mouth with a cloth,"
16532,ODYS. XXIV.,lest they should suck in a gnat with their breath; and some carefully
16533,ODYS. XXIV.,"sweep the floor ere they tread upon it, lest they dislodge the soul of"
16534,ODYS. XXIV.,"an insect. And yet they do not know that in the water they drink, and in"
16535,ODYS. XXIV.,"every salad they eat, they cause the death of innumerable living"
16536,ODYS. XXIV.,creatures.
16537,ODYS. XXIV.,
16538,ODYS. XXIV.,"The sacred books of the Hindoos are written in a dead language, the"

16540,ODYS. XXIV.,"this are they, says Mr. Dow, that only one Mussulman was ever instructed"
16541,ODYS. XXIV.,"in it, and his knowledge was obtained by fraud. Mahummud Akbar, emperor"
16542,ODYS. XXIV.,"of India, though bred a Mohammedan, studied several religions. In the"
16543,ODYS. XXIV.,"Christian he was instructed by a Portuguese. But, finding that of the"
16544,ODYS. XXIV.,"Hindoos inaccessible, he had recourse to art. A boy named Feizi, was, as"
16545,ODYS. XXIV.,"the orphan of a Brahmin, put under the care of one of the most eminent"
16546,ODYS. XXIV.,"of these philosophers, and obtained full knowledge of their hidden"
16547,ODYS. XXIV.,"religion. But the fraud being discovered, he was laid under the"
16548,ODYS. XXIV.,"restraint of an oath, and it does not appear that he ever communicated"
16549,ODYS. XXIV.,the knowledge thus acquired.

16789,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"particularly Barbosa, who seriously affirm that Homer drew the fine"
16790,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"description of Elysium, in his fourth Odyssey, from the beautiful"
16791,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"valleys of Spain, where, in one of his voyages, they say, he arrived."
16792,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"Egypt, however, seems to have a better title to this honour. The fable"
16793,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"of Charon, and the judges of hell, are evidently borrowed from the"
16794,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"Egyptian rites of burial, and are older than Homer. After a ferryman had"
16795,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"conveyed the corpse over a lake, certain judges examined the life of the"

16799,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"surrounded with deep canals, beautiful meadows, and a wilderness of"
16800,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,groves. It is universally known that the greatest part of the Grecian
16801,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,fables were fabricated from the customs and opinions of Egypt. Several
16802,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,other nations have also claimed the honour of affording the idea of the
16803,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,fields of the blessed. Even the Scotch challenge it. Many Grecian
16804,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"fables, says an author of that country, are evidently founded on the"
16805,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,reports of the Phoenician sailors. That these navigators traded to the
16806,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"coasts of Britain is certain. In the middle of summer, the season when"
16807,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"the ancients performed their voyages, for about six weeks there is no"
16808,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"night over the Orkney Islands; the disk of the sun, during that time,"
16809,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"scarcely sinking below the horizon. This appearance, together with the"
16810,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"calm which usually prevails at that season, and the beautiful verdure of"
16811,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"the islands, could not fail to excite the admiration of the Phoenicians;"
16812,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,and their accounts of the place naturally afforded the idea that these
16813,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"islands were inhabited by the spirits of the just. This, says our"
16814,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"author, is countenanced by Homer, who places his ""islands of the happy"""
16815,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"at the extremity of the ocean. That the fables of Scylla, the Gorgones,"
16816,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"and several others, were founded on the accounts of navigators, seems"
16817,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"probable; and, on this supposition, the Insulæ Fortunatæ, and"
16818,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"Purpurariæ, now the Canary and Madeira islands, also claim the honour of"
16819,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"giving colours to the description of Elysium. The truth, however,"
16820,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,appears to be this: That a place of happiness is reserved for the
16821,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,spirits of the good is the natural suggestion of that anxiety and hope
16822,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,concerning the future which animates the human breast. All the barbarous
16823,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,nations of Africa and America agree in placing their heaven in beautiful
16824,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"islands, at an immense distance over the ocean. The idea is universal,"

17061,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,[533] _The glorious Henry._--In pursuance of the reasons assigned in the
17062,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"preface, the translator has here taken the liberty to make a"
17063,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"transposition in the order of his author. In Camoëns, Don Pedro de"
17064,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"Menezes, and his son De Vian, conclude the description of the pictured"
17065,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"ensigns. Don Henry, the greatest man perhaps that ever Portugal"
17066,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"produced, has certainly the best title to close this procession of the"
17067,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"Lusian heroes. And, as he was the father of navigation, particularly of"
17068,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"the voyage of GAMA, to sum up the narrative with his encomium has even"
17069,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,some critical propriety.
17070,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,
17071,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"These observations were suggested by the conduct of Camoëns, whose"
17072,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"design, like that of Virgil, was to write a poem which might contain all"
17073,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,the triumphs of his country. As the shield of Æneas supplies what could
17074,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"not be introduced in the vision of Elysium, so the ensigns of GAMA"
17075,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,complete the purpose of the third and fourth Lusiads. The use of that
17076,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"long episode, the conversation with the King of Melinda, and its"
17077,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"connection with the subject, have been already observed. The seeming"
17078,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"episode of the pictures, while it fulfills the promise--"
17079,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,
17080,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"_And all my country's wars the song adorn,_"
17081,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,
17082,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,is also admirably connected with the conduct of the poem. The Hindoos
17083,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"naturally desire to be informed of the country, the history, and power"
17084,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"of their foreign visitors, and Paulus sets it before their eyes. In"
17085,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,every progression of the scenery the business of the poem advances. The
17086,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,regent and his attendants are struck with the warlike grandeur and power
17087,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"of the strangers, and to accept of their friendship, or to prevent the"
17088,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,forerunners of so martial a nation from carrying home the tidings of the
17089,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"discovery of India, becomes the great object of their consideration."

17132,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"but, when illustriously kindled, cannot_. Naked, however, as this is,"
17133,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,the imitation of Camoëns is evident. As Castera is so very bold in his
17134,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"encomium of this fine simile of the sun, it is but justice to add his"
17135,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"translation of it, together with the original Portuguese, and the"
17136,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,translation of Fanshaw. Thus the French translator:--
17137,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,
17138,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"_Les yeux peuvent soûtenir la clarté du soleil naissant, mais lorsqu'il"
17139,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"s'est avancé dans sa carrière lumineuse, et que ses rayons répandent les"
17140,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"ardeurs du midi, on tacherait en vain de l'envisager; un prompt"
17141,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,aveuglement serait le prix de cette audace._
17142,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,
17143,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,Thus elegantly in the original:--
17144,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,
17145,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"""Em quanto he fraca a força desta gente,"
17146,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"Ordena como em tudo se resista,"
17147,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"Porque quando o Sol sahe, facilmente"
17148,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,Se pòde nelle por a aguda vista:
17149,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"Porem despois que sobe claro, & ardente,"
17150,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,Se a agudeza dos olhos o conquista
17151,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"Tao cega fica, quando ficareis,"
17152,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"Se raizes criar lhe nao tolheis."""
17153,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,
17154,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,And thus humbled by Fanshaw:--
17155,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,
17156,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"""_Now_ whilst this people's strength is not yet knit,"
17157,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,Think how ye may resist them by all ways.

17159,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,Upon his _morning beauty_ men may gaze;
17160,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"But let him once up to his _zenith_ git,"
17161,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,He strikes them _blind_ with his _meridian rays_;
17162,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"So _blind_ will ye be, if ye look not too't,"
17163,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"If ye permit these _cedars_ to take root."""
17164,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,
17165,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,
17166,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,[537]
17167,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,
17168,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"_Around him stand,"
17169,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"With haggard looks, the hoary Magi band.--_"
17170,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,
17171,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"The Brahmins, the diviners of India. Ammianus Marcellinus, l. 23, says,"
17172,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,that the Persian Magi derived their knowledge from the Brachmanes of
17173,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"India. And Arrianus, l. 7, expressly gives the Brahmins the name of"
17174,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"Magi. The Magi of India, says he, told Alexander, on his pretensions to"
17175,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"divinity, that in everything he was like other men, except that he took"
17176,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"less rest, and did more mischief. The Brahmins are never among modern"
17177,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,writers called Magi.
17178,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,
17179,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,[538] _The hov'ring demon gives the dreadful sign._--This has an
17180,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"allusion to the truth of history. Barros relates, that an anger being"
17181,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"brought before the Zamorim, ""_Em hum vaso de agua l'he mostrara hunas"
17182,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"naos, que vin ham de muy longe para a India, e que a gente d'ellas seria"
17183,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,total destruiçam dos Mouros de aquellas partes._--In a vessel of water
17184,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"he showed him some ships which from a great distance came to India, the"
17185,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"people of which would effect the utter subversion of the Moors."" Camoëns"
17186,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,has certainly chosen a more poetical method of describing this
17187,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"divination, a method in the spirit of Virgil; nor in this is he inferior"
17188,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,to his great master. The supernatural flame which seizes on Lavinia
17189,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"while assisting at the sacrifice alone excepted, every other part of the"
17190,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"augury of Latinus, and his dream in the Albunean forest, whither he went"
17191,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"to consult his ancestor, the god Faunus, in dignity and poetical"
17192,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"colouring, cannot come in comparison with the divination of the Magi,"
17193,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,and the appearance of the demon in the dream of the Moorish priest.
17194,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,
17195,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"[539] _Th'eternal yoke._--This picture, it may perhaps be said, is but a"
17196,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"bad compliment to the heroes of the Lusiad, and the fruits of their"
17197,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"discovery. A little consideration, however, will vindicate Camoëns. It"
17198,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,is the demon and the enemies of the Portuguese who procure this
17199,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"divination; everything in it is dreadful, on purpose to determine the"
17200,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,zamorim to destroy the fleet of GAMA. In a former prophecy of the
17201,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,conquest of India (when the catual describes the sculpture of the royal
17202,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"palace), our poet has been careful to ascribe the happiest effects to"
17203,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,the discovery of his heroes:--
17204,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,
17205,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"""Beneath their sway majestic, wise, and mild,"
17206,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"Proud of her victors' laws, thrice happier India smil'd."""
17207,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,
17208,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,
17209,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"[540] _So let the tyrant plead._--In this short declamation, a seeming"
17210,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"excrescence, the business of the poem in reality is carried on. The"
17211,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"zamorim, and his prime minister, the catual, are artfully characterised"
17212,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,in it; and the assertion--
17213,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,
17214,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"_Lur'd was the regent with the Moorish gold,_"
17215,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,
17216,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,is happily introduced by the declamatory reflections which immediately
17217,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,precede it.
17218,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,
17219,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,[541]
17220,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,
17221,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"_The Moors----their ancient deeds relate,"
17222,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,Their ever-faithful service of the state.--_
17223,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,
17224,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,An explanation of the word _Moor_ is here necessary. When the East
17225,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"afforded no more field for the sword of the conqueror, the Saracens,"
17226,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"assisted by the Moors, who had embraced their religion, laid the finest"
17227,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,countries in Europe in blood and desolation. As their various
17228,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"embarkations were from the empire of Morocco, the Europeans gave the"
17229,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,name of _Moors_ to all the professors of the Mohammedan religion. In the
17230,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,same manner the eastern nations blended all the armies of the Crusaders
17231,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"under one appellation, and the _Franks_, of whom the army of Godfrey was"
17232,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"mostly composed, became their common name for all the inhabitants of the"
17233,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"West. Before the arrival of GAMA, as already observed, all the traffic"
17234,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"of the East, from the Ethiopian side of Africa to China, was in the"
17235,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"hands of Arabian Mohammedans, who, without incorporating with the pagan"
17236,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"natives, had their colonies established in every country commodious for"
17237,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,commerce. These the Portuguese called Moors; and at present the
17238,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,Mohammedans of India are called the Moors of Hindostan by our English
17239,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"writers. The intelligence these Moors gave to one another, relative to"
17240,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,the actions of GAMA; the general terror with which they beheld the
17241,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"appearance of Europeans, whose rivalship they dreaded as the destruction"
17242,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,of their power; the various frauds and arts they employed to prevent the
17243,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"return of one man of GAMA'S fleet to Europe, and their threat to"
17244,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"withdraw from the dominions of the zamorim, are all according to the"
17245,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"truth of history. The speeches of the zamorim and of GAMA, which follow,"
17246,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,are also founded in truth.

17252,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"only brought with them some preserves and confections, with trinkets of"
17253,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"coral, of glass, and other trifles. This opinion, however, deceived"
17254,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"them. In Melinda and in Calicut they found civilized nations, where the"
17255,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,arts flourished; who wanted nothing; who were possessed of all the
17256,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,refinements and delicacies on which we value ourselves. The King of
17257,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,Melinda had the generosity to be contented with the present which GAMA
17258,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"made; but the zamorim, with a disdainful eye, beheld the gifts which"
17259,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"were offered to him. The present was this: Four mantles of scarlet, six"
17260,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"hats adorned with feathers, four chaplets of coral beads, twelve Turkey"
17261,MOTHER HUBBERD'S TALE.,"carpets, seven drinking cups of brass, a chest of sugar, two barrels of"

17348,HOOLE.,
17349,HOOLE.,We have already seen the warm encomium paid by Tasso to his

17376,HOOLE.,
17377,HOOLE.,The conclusion of this canto has been slightly altered by the
17378,HOOLE.,"translator. Camoëns, adhering to history, makes GAMA (when his factors"

17380,HOOLE.,hostages. At the intreaty of their wives and children the zamorim

17452,STANZA X.,
17453,STANZA X.,"Had this been mentioned sooner, the interest of the catastrophe of the"
17454,STANZA X.,"poem must have languished. Though he is not a warrior, the unexpected"
17455,STANZA X.,friend of GAMA bears a much more considerable part in the action of the
17456,STANZA X.,"Lusiad than the faithful Achates, the friend of the hero, bears in the"
17457,STANZA X.,business of the Æneid.
17458,STANZA X.,
17459,STANZA X.,[560] _There wast thou call'd to thy celestial home._--This exclamatory
17460,STANZA X.,"address to the Moor Monzaida, however it may appear digressive, has a"
17461,STANZA X.,double propriety. The conversion of the Eastern world is the great
17462,STANZA X.,"purpose of the expedition of GAMA, and Monzaida is the first fruits of"
17463,STANZA X.,"that conversion. The good characters of the victorious heroes, however"
17464,STANZA X.,"neglected by the great genius of Homer, have a fine effect in making an"
17465,STANZA X.,"epic poem interest us and please. It might have been said, that Monzaida"
17466,STANZA X.,"was a traitor to his friends, who crowned his villainy with apostacy."
17467,STANZA X.,"Camoëns has, therefore, wisely drawn him with other features, worthy of"
17468,STANZA X.,"the friendship of GAMA. Had this been neglected, the hero of the Lusiad"
17469,STANZA X.,"might have shared the fate of the wise Ulysses of the Iliad, against"
17470,STANZA X.,"whom, as Voltaire justly observes, every reader bears a secret ill will."
17471,STANZA X.,Nor is the poetical character of Monzaida unsupported by history. He was
17472,STANZA X.,"not an Arab Moor, so he did not desert his countrymen. These Moors had"
17473,STANZA X.,determined on the destruction of GAMA; Monzaida admired and esteemed
17474,STANZA X.,"him, and therefore generously revealed to him his danger. By his"
17475,STANZA X.,"attachment to GAMA he lost all his effects in India, a circumstance"
17476,STANZA X.,which his prudence and knowledge of affairs must have certainly
17477,STANZA X.,"foreseen. By the known dangers he encountered, by the loss he thus"
17478,STANZA X.,"voluntarily sustained, and by his after constancy, his sincerity is"
17479,STANZA X.,undoubtedly proved.

17481,STANZA X.,[561] _The joy of the fleet on the homeward departure from India._--We
17482,STANZA X.,"are now come to that part of the Lusiad, which, in the conduct of the"
17483,STANZA X.,"poem, is parallel to the great catastrophe of the Iliad, when, on the"
17484,STANZA X.,"death of Hector, Achilles thus addresses the Grecian army--"
17485,STANZA X.,
17486,STANZA X.,"""Ye sons of Greece, in triumph bring"
17487,STANZA X.,"The corpse of Hector, and your pæons sing:"

17489,STANZA X.,"'Hector is dead, and Ilion is no more.'"""
17490,STANZA X.,
17491,STANZA X.,"Our Portuguese poet, who in his machinery, and many other instances, has"
17492,STANZA X.,"followed the manner of Virgil, now forsakes him. In a very bold and"
17493,STANZA X.,masterly spirit he now models his poem by the steps of Homer. What of
17494,STANZA X.,"the Lusiad yet remains, in poetical conduct (though not in an imitation"
17495,STANZA X.,"of circumstances), exactly resembles the latter part of the Iliad. The"
17496,STANZA X.,"games at the funeral of Patroclus, and the redemption of the body of"
17497,STANZA X.,"Hector, are the completion of the rage of Achilles. In the same manner,"
17498,STANZA X.,"the reward of the heroes, and the consequences of their expedition"
17499,STANZA X.,complete the unity of the Lusiad. I cannot say it appears that Milton
17500,STANZA X.,ever read our poet (though Fanshaw's translation was published in his
17501,STANZA X.,time); yet no instance can be given of a more striking resemblance of
17502,STANZA X.,"plan and conduct, than may be produced in two principal parts of the"
17503,STANZA X.,"poem of Camoëns, and of the Paradise Lost.--See the Dissertation which"

17512,STANZA X.,"poetical conduct, bears a striking resemblance to the digressive"
17513,STANZA X.,"histories with which Homer enriches and adorns his poems, particularly"
17514,STANZA X.,"to the beautiful description of the feast of the gods with ""the"
17515,STANZA X.,"blameless Ethiopians."" It also contains a masterly commentary on the"
17516,STANZA X.,machinery of the Lusiad. The Divine Love conducts GAMA to India. The
17517,STANZA X.,same Divine Love is represented as preparing to reform the corrupted
17518,STANZA X.,"world, when its attention is particularly called to bestow a foretaste"
17519,STANZA X.,of immortality on the heroes of the expedition which discovered the
17520,STANZA X.,"eastern world. Nor do the wild fantastic loves, mentioned in this little"
17521,STANZA X.,"episode, afford any objection against this explanation, an explanation"
17522,STANZA X.,which is expressly given in the episode itself. These wild fantastic
17523,STANZA X.,"amours signify, in the allegory, the wild sects of different"
17524,STANZA X.,"enthusiasts, which spring up under the wings of the best and most"
17525,STANZA X.,"rational institutions; and which, however contrary to each other, all"
17526,STANZA X.,agree in deriving their authority from the same source.
17527,STANZA X.,
17528,STANZA X.,[565] _A young Actæon._--The French translator has the following
17529,STANZA X.,"characteristic note: ""This passage is an eternal monument of the"
17530,STANZA X.,"freedoms taken by Camoëns, and at the same time a proof of the"
17531,STANZA X.,imprudence of poets; an authentic proof of that prejudice which
17532,STANZA X.,"sometimes blinds them, notwithstanding all the light of their genius."
17533,STANZA X.,"The modern Actæon of whom he speaks, was King Sebastian. He loved the"
17534,STANZA X.,"chase; but, that pleasure, which is one of the most innocent and one of"
17535,STANZA X.,"the most noble we can possibly taste, did not at all interrupt his"
17536,STANZA X.,"attention to the affairs of state, and did not render him savage, as our"
17537,STANZA X.,author pretends. On this point the historians are rather to be believed.
17538,STANZA X.,"And what would the lot of princes be, were they allowed no relaxation"
17539,STANZA X.,"from their toils, while they allow that privilege to their people?"
17540,STANZA X.,"Subjects as we are, let us venerate the amusements of our sovereigns;"
17541,STANZA X.,"let us believe that the august cares for our good, which employ them,"
17542,STANZA X.,"follow them often even to the very bosom of their pleasures."""
17543,STANZA X.,
17544,STANZA X.,Many are the strokes in the Lusiad which must endear the character of
17545,STANZA X.,Camoëns to every reader of sensibility. The noble freedom and manly
17546,STANZA X.,"indignation with which he mentions the foible of his prince, and the"
17547,STANZA X.,"flatterers of his court, would do honour to the greatest names of Greece"
17548,STANZA X.,"or Rome. While the shadow of freedom remained in Portugal, the greatest"
17549,STANZA X.,"men of that nation, in the days of Lusian heroism, thought and conducted"
17550,STANZA X.,themselves in the spirit of Camoëns. A noble anecdote of this brave
17551,STANZA X.,"spirit offers itself. Alonzo IV., surnamed the Brave, ascended the"
17552,STANZA X.,throne of Portugal in the vigour of his age. The pleasures of the chase
17553,STANZA X.,"engrossed all his attention. His confidants and favourites encouraged,"
17554,STANZA X.,"and allured him to it. His time was spent in the forests of Cintra,"
17555,STANZA X.,while the affairs of government were neglected or executed by those
17556,STANZA X.,whose interest it was to keep their sovereign in ignorance. His
17557,STANZA X.,"presence, at last, being necessary at Lisbon, he entered the council"
17558,STANZA X.,"with all the brisk impetuosity of a young sportsman, and with great"
17559,STANZA X.,familiarity and gaiety entertained his nobles with the history of a
17560,STANZA X.,"whole month spent in hunting, in fishing, and shooting. When he had"
17561,STANZA X.,"finished his narrative, a nobleman of the first rank rose up: ""Courts"
17562,STANZA X.,"and camps,"" said he, ""were allotted for kings, not woods and deserts."
17563,STANZA X.,Even the affairs of private men suffer when recreation is preferred to
17564,STANZA X.,"business. But when the whims of pleasure engross the thoughts of a king,"
17565,STANZA X.,a whole nation is consigned to ruin. We came here for other purposes
17566,STANZA X.,"than to hear the exploits of the chase, exploits which are only"
17567,STANZA X.,intelligible to grooms and falconers. If your majesty will attend to the
17568,STANZA X.,"wants, and remove the grievances of your people, you will find them"
17569,STANZA X.,"obedient subjects; if not----"" The king, starting with rage, interrupted"
17570,STANZA X.,"him, ""If not, what?"" ""If not,"" resumed the nobleman, in a firm tone,"
17571,STANZA X.,"""they will look for another and a better king."" Alonzo, in the highest"
17572,STANZA X.,"transport of passion, expressed his resentment, and hasted out of the"
17573,STANZA X.,"room. In a little while, however, he returned, calm and reconciled: ""I"
17574,STANZA X.,"perceive,"" said he, ""the truth of what you say. He who will not execute"
17575,STANZA X.,"the duties of a king, cannot long have good subjects. Remember, from"
17576,STANZA X.,"this day, you have nothing more to do with Alonzo the sportsman, but"
17577,STANZA X.,"with Alonzo the king of Portugal."" His majesty was as good as his"
17578,STANZA X.,"promise, and became, as a warrior and politician, one of the greatest of"
17579,STANZA X.,the Portuguese monarchs.
17580,STANZA X.,
17581,STANZA X.,"[566] _With love's fierce flames his frozen heart shall burn._--""It is"
17582,STANZA X.,"said, that upon the faith of a portrait Don Sebastian fell in love with"
17583,STANZA X.,"Margaret of France, daughter of Henry II., and demanded her in marriage,"
17584,STANZA X.,"but was refused. The Spaniards treated him no less unfavourably, for"
17585,STANZA X.,they also rejected his proposals for one of the daughters of Philip II.
17586,STANZA X.,Our author considers these refusals as the punishment of Don Sebastian's
17587,STANZA X.,excessive attachment to the chase; but this is only a consequence of the
17588,STANZA X.,prejudice with which he viewed the amusements of his prince. The truth
17589,STANZA X.,"is, these princesses were refused for political reasons, and not with"
17590,STANZA X.,"any regard to the manner in which he filled up his moments of leisure."""
17591,STANZA X.,
17592,STANZA X.,"Thus Castera, who, with the same spirit of sagacity, starts and answers"
17593,STANZA X.,"the following objections: ""But here is a difficulty: Camoëns wrote"
17594,STANZA X.,"during the life of Don Sebastian, but the circumstance he relates (the"
17595,STANZA X.,"return of GAMA) happened several years before, under the reign of"
17596,STANZA X.,"Emmanuel. How, therefore, could he say that Cupid then saw Don Sebastian"
17597,STANZA X.,"at the chase, when that prince was not then born? The answer is easy:"
17598,STANZA X.,"Cupid, in the allegory of this work, represents the love of God, the"
17599,STANZA X.,"Holy Spirit, who is God himself. Now the Divinity admits of no"
17600,STANZA X.,"distinction of time; one glance of his eye beholds the past, the"
17601,STANZA X.,"present, and the future; everything is present before him."""
17602,STANZA X.,
17603,STANZA X.,This defence of the fiction of Actæon is not more absurd than useless.
17604,STANZA X.,"The free and bold spirit of poetry, and in particular the nature of"
17605,STANZA X.,"allegory, defend it. The poet might easily have said, that Cupid"
17606,STANZA X.,_foresaw_; but had he said so his satire had been much less genteel. As
17607,STANZA X.,the sentiments of Castera on this passage are extremely characteristic
17608,STANZA X.,"of French ideas, another note from him will perhaps be agreeable."
17609,STANZA X.,"""Several Portuguese writers have remarked,"" says he, ""that the wish--"
17610,STANZA X.,
17611,STANZA X.,"'Of these lov'd dogs that now his passions sway,"
17612,STANZA X.,Ah! may he never fall the hapless prey!'
17613,STANZA X.,
17614,STANZA X.,"Had in it an air of prophecy; and fate, in effect, seemed careful to"
17615,STANZA X.,"accomplish it, in making the presaged woes to fall upon Don Sebastian."
17616,STANZA X.,"If he did not fall a prey to his pack of hounds, we may, however, say"
17617,STANZA X.,"that he was devoured by his favourites, who misled his youth and his"
17618,STANZA X.,great soul. But at any rate our poet has carried the similitude too far.
17619,STANZA X.,"It was certainly injurious to Don Sebastian, who nevertheless had the"
17620,STANZA X.,"bounty not only not to punish this audacity, but to reward the just"
17621,STANZA X.,eulogies which the author had bestowed on him in other places. As much
17622,STANZA X.,"as the indiscretion of Camoëns ought to surprise us, as much ought we to"
17623,STANZA X.,"admire the generosity of his master."""
17624,STANZA X.,
17625,STANZA X.,"This foppery, this slavery in thinking, cannot fail to rouse the"
17626,STANZA X.,"indignation of every manly breast, when the facts are fairly stated. Don"
17627,STANZA X.,"Sebastian, who ascended the throne when a child, was a prince of great"
17628,STANZA X.,"abilities and great spirit, but his youth was poisoned with the most"
17629,STANZA X.,romantic ideas of military glory. The affairs of state were left to his
17630,STANZA X.,"ministers (for whose character see the next note), his other studies"
17631,STANZA X.,"were neglected, and military exercises, of which he not unjustly"
17632,STANZA X.,"esteemed the chase a principal, were almost his sole employ. Camoëns"
17633,STANZA X.,"beheld this romantic turn, and in a genteel allegorical satire foreboded"
17634,STANZA X.,"its consequences. The wish, that his prince might not fall the prey of"
17635,STANZA X.,"his favourite passion, was in vain. In a rash, ill-concerted expedition"
17636,STANZA X.,"into Africa, Don Sebastian lost his crown in his twenty-fifth year, an"
17637,STANZA X.,event which soon after produced the fall of the Portuguese empire. Had
17638,STANZA X.,"the nobility possessed the spirit of Camoëns, had they, like him,"
17639,STANZA X.,"endeavoured to check the quixotism of a young generous prince, that"
17640,STANZA X.,"prince might have reigned long and happy, and Portugal might have"
17641,STANZA X.,"escaped the Spanish yoke, which soon followed his defeat at Alcazar; a"
17642,STANZA X.,"yoke which sunk Portugal into an abyss of misery, from which, in all"

17701,STANZA X.,"This simile, however, is not in the original. It is adopted from an"

17746,STANZA X.,"is pedantry; a moderate use of it, however, in a poem of those times"
17747,STANZA X.,"pleases, because it discovers the stages of composition, and has in"

17766,STANZA X.,"little landscape views. Without these, all the names of trees and"
17767,STANZA X.,"flowers, though strung together in tolerable numbers, contain no more"
17768,STANZA X.,"poetry than a nurseryman or a florist's catalogue. In Statius, in Tasso"
17769,STANZA X.,"and Spenser's admired forests (Ger. Liber. c. 3. st. 75, 76, and F."
17770,STANZA X.,"Queen, b. 1 c. 1. st. 8, 9), the poetry consists entirely in the"
17771,STANZA X.,"happiness of the epithets. In Camoëns, all the three requisites are"
17772,STANZA X.,admirably attained and blended together.

17797,STANZA X.,"had nothing in it impure, but was only the love which nature bears to"
17798,STANZA X.,"the sun."" The fables of antiquity have generally a threefold"
17799,STANZA X.,"interpretation, an historical allusion, a physical and a metaphysical"
17800,STANZA X.,"allegory. In the latter view, the fable of Adonis is only applicable to"
17801,STANZA X.,"the celestial Venus. A divine youth is outrageously slain, but shall"
17802,STANZA X.,"revive again at the restoration of the golden age. Several nations, it"
17803,STANZA X.,"is well known, under different names, celebrated the Mysteries, or the"
17804,STANZA X.,"death and resurrection of Adonis; among whom were the British Druids, as"
17805,STANZA X.,"we are told by Dr. Stukely. In the same manner Cupid, in the fable of"

17844,STANZA X.,"esteemed, in ancient poetry, one of the most daring adventures, the"
17845,STANZA X.,success of which was accounted miraculous. The allusions of Camoëns to

17848,STANZA X.,[584] _Wide o'er the beauteous isle the lovely fair._--We now come to
17849,STANZA X.,"the passage condemned by Voltaire as so lascivious, that no nation in"
17850,STANZA X.,"Europe, except the Portuguese and Italians, could bear it. The fate of"
17851,STANZA X.,Camoëns has hitherto been very peculiar. The mixture of Pagan and
17852,STANZA X.,"Christian mythology in his machinery has been anathematized, and his"
17853,STANZA X.,island of love represented as a brothel. Yet both accusations are the
17854,STANZA X.,arrogant assertions of the most superficial acquaintance with his works.
17855,STANZA X.,"His poem itself, and a comparison of its parts with the similar conduct"
17856,STANZA X.,"of the greatest modern poets, will clearly evince, that in both"
17857,STANZA X.,instances no modern epic writer of note has given less offence to true
17858,STANZA X.,criticism.
17859,STANZA X.,
17860,STANZA X.,"Not to mention Ariosto, whose descriptions will often admit of no"
17861,STANZA X.,"palliation, Tasso, Spenser, and Milton, have always been esteemed among"
17862,STANZA X.,"the chastest of poets, yet in that delicacy of warm description, which"
17863,STANZA X.,"Milton has so finely exemplified in the nuptials of our first parents,"
17864,STANZA X.,none of them can boast the continued uniformity of the Portuguese poet.
17865,STANZA X.,Though there is a warmth in the colouring of Camoëns which even the
17866,STANZA X.,genius of Tasso has not reached: and though the island of Armida is
17867,STANZA X.,"evidently copied from the Lusiad, yet those who are possessed of the"
17868,STANZA X.,"finer feelings, will easily discover an essential difference between the"
17869,STANZA X.,"love-scenes of the two poets, a difference greatly in favour of the"
17870,STANZA X.,delicacy of the former. Though the nymphs in Camoëns are detected naked
17871,STANZA X.,"in the woods, and in the stream, and though desirous to captivate, still"
17872,STANZA X.,their behaviour is that of the virgin who hopes to be the spouse. They
17873,STANZA X.,"act the part of offended modesty; even when they yield they are silent,"
17874,STANZA X.,"and behave in every respect like Milton's Eve in the state of innocence,"

17884,STANZA X.,"To sum up all, the nuptial sanctity draws its hallowed curtains, and a"
17885,STANZA X.,masterly allegory shuts up the love-scenes of Camoëns.

17887,STANZA X.,"How different from all this is the island of Armida in Tasso, and its"
17888,STANZA X.,"translation, the bower of Acrasia in Spenser! In these virtue is"
17889,STANZA X.,"seduced; the scene therefore is less delicate. The nymphs, while they"
17890,STANZA X.,"are bathing, in place of the modesty of the bride as in Camoëns, employ"
17891,STANZA X.,"all the arts of the lascivious wanton. They stay not to be wooed; but,"

17894,STANZA X.,_The amorous sweet spoils to greedy eyes reveal._
17895,STANZA X.,
17896,STANZA X.,"One stanza from our English poet, which, however, is rather fuller than"

17898,STANZA X.,
17899,STANZA X.,"""Withal she laughed and she blush'd withal,"
17900,STANZA X.,"That blushing to her laughter gave more grace,"
17901,STANZA X.,"And laughter to her blushing, as did fall."
17902,STANZA X.,"Now when they spy'd the knight to slack his pace,"
17903,STANZA X.,"Them to behold, and _in his sparkling face"
17904,STANZA X.,"The secret signs of kindled lust appear_,"
17905,STANZA X.,"Their wanton merriments they did increase,"
17906,STANZA X.,"And to him beckon'd to approach more near,"
17907,STANZA X.,"_And show'd him many sights, that courage cold could rear_."
17908,STANZA X.,
17909,STANZA X.,This and other descriptions--
17910,STANZA X.,
17911,STANZA X.,"""Upon a bed of roses she was laid"
17912,STANZA X.,"As faint through heat, or dight to pleasant sin""--"
17913,STANZA X.,
17914,STANZA X.,present every idea of lascivious voluptuousness. The allurements of
17915,STANZA X.,"speech are also added. Songs, which breathe every persuasive, are heard;"
17916,STANZA X.,and the nymphs boldly call to the beholder:--
17917,STANZA X.,
17918,STANZA X.,_E' dolce campo di battaglia il letto
17919,STANZA X.,"Fiavi, e l'herbetta morbida de' prati._--TASSO."

17922,STANZA X.,"Or flow'ry turf amid the smiling mead.""--HOOLE."
17923,STANZA X.,
17924,STANZA X.,"These, and the whole scenes in the domains of Armida and Acrasia, are in"
17925,STANZA X.,a turn of manner the reverse of the island of Venus. In these the
17926,STANZA X.,"expression and idea are meretricious. In Camoëns, though the colouring"
17927,STANZA X.,"is even warmer, yet the modesty of the Venus de Medicis is still"
17928,STANZA X.,preserved. In everything he describes there is still something strongly
17929,STANZA X.,similar to the modest attitude of the arms of that celebrated statue.
17930,STANZA X.,"Though prudery, that usual mask of the impurest minds, may condemn him,"
17931,STANZA X.,"yet those of the most chaste, though less gloomy turn, will allow, that"
17932,STANZA X.,"in comparison with others, he might say,--_Virginibus puerisque canto_."
17933,STANZA X.,
17934,STANZA X.,"Spenser also, where he does not follow Tasso, is often gross; and even"
17935,STANZA X.,"in some instances, where the expression is most delicate, the picture is"
17936,STANZA X.,nevertheless indecently lascivious.

17939,STANZA X.,
17940,STANZA X.,[586] _Madd'ning as he said._--At the end of his Homer Mr. Pope has
17941,STANZA X.,given an index of the instances of imitative and sentimental harmony
17942,STANZA X.,contained in his translations. He has also often even in his notes
17943,STANZA X.,pointed out the adaptation of sound to sense. The translator of the
17944,STANZA X.,"Lusiad hopes he may for once say, that he has not been inattentive to"
17945,STANZA X.,this great essential of good versification: how he has succeeded the
17946,STANZA X.,judicious only must determine. The speech of Leonard to the cursory
17947,STANZA X.,"reader may perhaps sometimes appear careless, and sometimes turgid and"
17948,STANZA X.,"stiff. That speech, however, is an attempt at the imitative and"
17949,STANZA X.,"sentimental harmony, and with the judicious he rests its fate. As the"
17950,STANZA X.,"translation in this instance exceeds the original in length, the"
17951,STANZA X.,"objection of a foreign critic requires attention. An old pursy Abbé,"
17952,STANZA X.,(and critics are apt to judge by themselves) may indeed be surprised
17953,STANZA X.,that a man out of breath with running should be able to talk so long.
17954,STANZA X.,"But, had he consulted the experiences of others, he would have found it"
17955,STANZA X.,was no wonderful matter for a stout and young cavalier to talk twice as
17956,STANZA X.,"much, though fatigued with the chase of a couple of miles, provided the"
17957,STANZA X.,"supposition be allowed, that he treads on the last steps of his flying"
17958,STANZA X.,mistress.
17959,STANZA X.,
17960,STANZA X.,"[587] _Hence, ye profane._--We have already observed, that in every"
17961,STANZA X.,other poet the love scenes are generally described as those of guilt and
17962,STANZA X.,remorse. The contrary character of those of Camoëns not only gives them
17963,STANZA X.,"a delicacy unknown to other moderns, but, by the fiction of the spousal"
17964,STANZA X.,"rites, the allegory and machinery of the poem are most happily"
17965,STANZA X.,conducted.
17966,STANZA X.,
17967,STANZA X.,[588] _Spread o'er the eastern world the dread alarms._--This admonition
17968,STANZA X.,places the whole design of the poem before us. To extirpate
17969,STANZA X.,"Mohammedanism, and propagate Christianity, were professed as the"
17970,STANZA X.,principal purpose of the discoveries of Prince Henry and King Emmanuel.
17971,STANZA X.,"In the beginning of the seventh Lusiad, the nations of Europe are"
17972,STANZA X.,"upbraided for permitting the Saracens to erect and possess an empire,"
17973,STANZA X.,"which alike threatened Europe and Christianity. The Portuguese, however,"
17974,STANZA X.,"the patriot poet concludes, will themselves overthrow their enormous"
17975,STANZA X.,"power: an event which is the proposed subject of the Lusiad, and which"
17976,STANZA X.,"is represented as, in effect, completed in the last book. On this"
17977,STANZA X.,"system, adopted by the poet, and which on every occasion was avowed by"
17978,STANZA X.,"their kings, the Portuguese made immense conquests in the East. Yet, let"
17979,STANZA X.,"it be remembered, to the honour of GAMA, and the first commanders who"
17980,STANZA X.,"followed his route, that the plots of the Moors, and their various"
17981,STANZA X.,"breaches of treaty, gave rise to the first wars which the Portuguese"
17982,STANZA X.,waged in Asia. On finding that all the colonies of the Moors were
17983,STANZA X.,"combined for their destruction, the Portuguese declared war against the"
17984,STANZA X.,"eastern Moors, and their allies, wherever they found them. The course of"
17985,STANZA X.,"human things, however, soon took place, and the sword of victory and"
17986,STANZA X.,power soon became the sword of tyranny and rapine.
17987,STANZA X.,
17988,STANZA X.,[589] _Far o'er the silver lake of Mexic._--The city of Mexico is
17989,STANZA X.,"environed with an extensive lake; or, according to Cortez, in his second"
17990,STANZA X.,"narration to Charles V., with two lakes, one of fresh, the other of salt"
17991,STANZA X.,"water, in circuit about fifty leagues. This situation, said the"
17992,STANZA X.,"Mexicans, was appointed by their God Vitzliputzli, who, according to the"
17993,STANZA X.,"explanation of their picture-histories, led their forefathers a journey"
17994,STANZA X.,"of fourscore years, in search of the promised land. Four of the"
17995,STANZA X.,principal priests carried the idol in a coffer of reeds. Whenever they
17996,STANZA X.,"halted they built a tabernacle for their god in the midst of their camp,"
17997,STANZA X.,"where they placed the coffer and the altar. They then sowed the land,"
17998,STANZA X.,"and their stay or departure, without regard to the harvest, was directed"
17999,STANZA X.,"by the orders received from their idol, till at last, by his command,"
18000,STANZA X.,they fixed their abode on the site of Mexico.

18007,STANZA X.,"render it less intoxicating, but on account of the cooling flavour it"
18008,STANZA X.,thereby received. Homer tells us that the wine which Ulysses gave to

18036,STANZA X.,"publication of his poem, at which time he was in his fifty-fifth year."
18037,STANZA X.,"This apostrophe to his muse may, perhaps, by some be blamed as another"
18038,STANZA X.,"digression; but, so little does it require defence, that one need not"
18039,STANZA X.,"hesitate to affirm that, had Homer, who often talks to his muse,"
18040,STANZA X.,"introduced, on these favourable opportunities, any little picture or"
18041,STANZA X.,"history of himself, these digressions would have been the most"
18042,STANZA X.,"interesting parts of his works. Had any history of Homer complained,"

18062,STANZA X.,
18063,STANZA X.,That the visionary boat of Charon groaned under the weight of Æneas is a
18064,STANZA X.,fine poetical stroke; but that the crazy rents let in the water is
18065,STANZA X.,"certainly lowering the image. The thought, however, as managed in"

18069,STANZA X.,The Lusiad affords many instances which must be highly pleasing to the

18074,STANZA X.,"every version of historical poetry must suffer, the translator has not"

18078,STANZA X.,"the allusions in the present book, endeavoured to throw every historical"

18102,STANZA X.,"the Tiber to his companions. Roman history, however, at this period, is"
18103,STANZA X.,often mixed with fable. Miltiades obtained a great victory over Darius
18104,STANZA X.,at Marathon. The stand made by Leonidas at Thermopylæ is well known. The
18105,STANZA X.,battles of Pacheco were in defence of the fords by which alone the city
18106,STANZA X.,"of Cochin could be entered. The numbers he withstood by land and sea,"
18107,STANZA X.,"and the victories he obtained, are much more astonishing than the"
18108,STANZA X.,defence of Thermopylæ.

18110,STANZA X.,[600] _Bound to the mast the godlike hero stands._--English history
18111,STANZA X.,"affords an instance of similar resolution in Admiral Bembo, who was"
18112,STANZA X.,"supported in a wooden frame, and continued the engagement after his legs"
18113,STANZA X.,and thighs were shivered in splinters. Contrary to the advice of his
18114,STANZA X.,"officers, the young Almeyda refused to bear off, though almost certain"
18115,STANZA X.,"to be overpowered, and though both wind and tide were against him. His"
18116,STANZA X.,"father had sharply upbraided him for a former retreat, where victory was"
18117,STANZA X.,thought impossible. He now fell the victim of his father's ideas of
18118,STANZA X.,military glory.

18121,STANZA X.,"the viceroy, Almeyda, attacked the combined fleets of Egypt, Cambaya,"
18122,STANZA X.,"and the zamorim, in the entrance and harbour of Diu, or Dio. The fleet"
18123,STANZA X.,"of the zamorim almost immediately fled. That of Melique Yaz, Lord of"
18124,STANZA X.,"Diu, suffered much; but the greatest slaughter fell upon the Egyptians"
18125,STANZA X.,"and Turks, commanded by Mir-Hocem, who had defeated and killed the young"
18126,STANZA X.,"Almeyda. Of 800 Mamelukes, or Turks, who fought under Mir-Hocem, only"
18127,STANZA X.,"22, says Osorius, survived this engagement. Melique Yaz, says Faria y"
18128,STANZA X.,"Sousa, was born in slavery, and descended of the Christians of Roxia."
18129,STANZA X.,The road to preferment is often a dirty one; but Melique's was much less
18130,STANZA X.,so than that of many. As the King of Cambaya was one day riding in
18131,STANZA X.,"state, an unlucky kite dunged upon his royal head. His majesty in great"
18132,STANZA X.,wrath swore he would give all he was worth to have the offender killed.
18133,STANZA X.,"Melique, who was an expert archer, immediately despatched an arrow,"
18134,STANZA X.,which brought the audacious hawk to the ground. For the merit of this
18135,STANZA X.,"eminent service he was made Lord of Diu, or Dio, a considerable city,"

18144,STANZA X.,many of the dead Persians and Moors were found to have died by arrows.
18145,STANZA X.,"But as that weapon was not used by the Portuguese he conjectures that,"

18155,STANZA X.,"east, and the seat of their viceroys; for which purposes it is"
18156,STANZA X.,advantageously situated on the coast of Dekhan. It still remains in the
18157,STANZA X.,possession of the Portuguese.
18158,STANZA X.,
18159,STANZA X.,[607] _Malacca._--The conquest of this place was one of the greatest
18160,STANZA X.,actions of Albuquerque. It became the chief port of the eastern part of
18161,STANZA X.,"Portuguese India, and second only to Goa. Besides a great many pieces of"
18162,STANZA X.,"ordnance which were carried away by the Moors who escaped, 3000 large"
18163,STANZA X.,cannon remained the prize of the victors. When Albuquerque was on the
18164,STANZA X.,"way to Malacca, he attacked a large ship; but, just as his men were"
18165,STANZA X.,"going to board her, she suddenly appeared all in flames, which obliged"
18166,STANZA X.,the Portuguese to bear off. Three days afterwards the same vessel sent a
18167,STANZA X.,"boat to Albuquerque, offering an alliance, which was accepted. The"
18168,STANZA X.,"flames, says Osorius, were only artificial, and did not the least"
18169,STANZA X.,damage. Another wonderful adventure immediately happened. The admiral
18170,STANZA X.,soon after sent his long-boats to attack a ship commanded by one Nehoada
18171,STANZA X.,Beeguea. The enemy made an obstinate resistance. Nehoada himself was
18172,STANZA X.,"pierced with several mortal wounds, but lost not one drop of blood till"
18173,STANZA X.,"a bracelet was taken off his arm, when immediately the blood gushed out."
18174,STANZA X.,"According to Osorius, this was said to be occasioned by the virtue of a"
18175,STANZA X.,"stone in the bracelet, taken out of an animal called Cabrisia, which,"
18176,STANZA X.,"when worn on the body, could prevent the effusion of blood from the most"
18177,STANZA X.,grievous wounds.
18178,STANZA X.,
18179,STANZA X.,[608] _Yet art thou stain'd._--A detail of all the grant actions of
18180,STANZA X.,Albuquerque would have been tedious and unpoetical. Camoëns has chosen
18181,STANZA X.,"the most brilliant, and has happily suppressed the rest by a display of"
18182,STANZA X.,indignation. The French translator has the following note on this
18183,STANZA X.,"passage: ""Behold another instance of our author's prejudice! The action"
18184,STANZA X.,"which he condemns had nothing in it blameable: but, as he was of a most"
18185,STANZA X.,"amorous constitution, he thought every fault which could plead an amour"
18186,STANZA X.,"in its excuse ought to be pardoned; but true heroes, such as"
18187,STANZA X.,"Albuquerque, follow other maxims. This great man had in his palace a"
18188,STANZA X.,"beautiful Indian slave. He viewed her with the eyes of a father, and the"
18189,STANZA X.,"care of her education was his pleasure. A Portuguese soldier, named Ruy"
18190,STANZA X.,"Diaz, had the boldness to enter the general's apartment, where he"
18191,STANZA X.,succeeded so well with the girl that he obtained his desire. When
18192,STANZA X.,"Albuquerque heard of it, he immediately ordered him to the gallows."""
18193,STANZA X.,
18194,STANZA X.,"Camoëns, however, was no such undistinguishing libertine as this would"
18195,STANZA X.,represent him. In a few pages we find him praising the continence of Don
18196,STANZA X.,"Henry de Meneses, whose victory over his passions he calls the highest"
18197,STANZA X.,excellence of youth. Nor does it appear by what authority the Frenchman
18198,STANZA X.,assures us of the chaste paternal affection which Albuquerque bore to
18199,STANZA X.,this Indian girl. It was the great aim of Albuquerque to establish
18200,STANZA X.,"colonies in India, and, for that purpose, he encouraged his soldiers to"
18201,STANZA X.,"marry with the natives. The most sightly girls were selected, and"
18202,STANZA X.,"educated in the religion and household arts of Portugal, and portioned"
18203,STANZA X.,"at the expense of the general. These he called his daughters, and with"
18204,STANZA X.,"great pleasure he used to attend their weddings, several couples being"
18205,STANZA X.,"usually joined together at one time. At one of these nuptials, says"
18206,STANZA X.,"Faria, the festivity having continued late, and the brides being mixed"
18207,STANZA X.,"together, several of the bridegrooms committed a blunder. The mistakes"
18208,STANZA X.,"of the night, however, as they were all equal in point of honour, were"
18209,STANZA X.,"mutually forgiven in the morning, and each man took his proper wife whom"
18210,STANZA X.,he had received at the altar. This delicate anecdote of Albuquerque's
18211,STANZA X.,sons and daughters is as bad a commentary on the note of Castera as it
18212,STANZA X.,is on the severity which the commander showed to poor Diaz. Nor does
18213,STANZA X.,Camoëns stand alone in the condemnation of the general. The historian
18214,STANZA X.,"agrees with the poet. Mentioning the death of D. Antonio Noronha, ""This"
18215,STANZA X.,"gentleman,"" says Faria, ""used to moderate the violent temper of his"
18216,STANZA X.,"uncle, Albuquerque, which soon after showed itself in rigid severity. He"
18217,STANZA X.,ordered a soldier to be hanged for an amour with one of the slaves whom
18218,STANZA X.,"he called daughters, and whom he used to give in marriage. When some of"
18219,STANZA X.,his officers asked him what authority he had to take the poor man's
18220,STANZA X.,"life, he drew his sword, told them that was his commission, and"
18221,STANZA X.,"instantly broke them."" To marry his soldiers with the natives was the"
18222,STANZA X.,"plan of Albuquerque: his severity, therefore, seems unaccountable,"
18223,STANZA X.,"unless we admit the 'perhaps' of Camoëns, _ou de cioso_, perhaps it was"
18224,STANZA X.,"jealousy.--But, whatever incensed the general, the execution of the"
18225,STANZA X.,soldier was contrary to the laws of every nation;{*} and the honest
18226,STANZA X.,"indignation of Camoëns against one of the greatest of his countrymen,"
18227,STANZA X.,"one who was the grand architect of the Portuguese empire in the East,"
18228,STANZA X.,affords a noble instance of that manly freedom of sentiment which knows
18229,STANZA X.,no right by which king or peer may do injustice to the meanest subject.
18230,STANZA X.,"Nor can we omit the observation, that the above note of Castera is of a"
18231,STANZA X.,piece with the French devotion we have already seen him pay to the name
18232,STANZA X.,"of king, a devotion which breathes the true spirit of the blessed advice"
18233,STANZA X.,"given by Father Paul to the republic of Venice: ""When a nobleman commits"
18234,STANZA X.,"an offence against a subject,"" says the Jesuit, ""let every means be"
18235,STANZA X.,"tried to justify him. But, if a subject has offended a nobleman, let him"
18236,STANZA X.,"be punished with the utmost severity."""

18256,STANZA X.,"resemblance to the histories which often, even in the heat of battle,"
18257,STANZA X.,the heroes of Homer relate to each other. That these little episodes
18258,STANZA X.,have their beauty and propriety in an epic poem will strongly appear
18259,STANZA X.,from a view of M. de la Motte's translation of the Iliad into French
18260,STANZA X.,"verse. The four and twenty books of Homer he has contracted into twelve,"
18261,STANZA X.,and these contain no more lines than about four books of the original. A
18262,STANZA X.,thousand embellishments which the warm poetical feelings of Homer
18263,STANZA X.,suggested to him are thus thrown out by the Frenchman. But what is the
18264,STANZA X.,"consequence of this improvement? The work of La Motte is unread, even by"
18265,STANZA X.,"his own countrymen, and despised by every foreigner who has the least"

18270,STANZA X.,"India, the Sultan of Egypt sent Maurus, the abbot of the monks at"
18271,STANZA X.,"Jerusalem, who inhabit Mount Sion, on an embassy to Pope Julius II. The"
18272,STANZA X.,"sultan, with severe threats to the Christians of the East in case of"
18273,STANZA X.,"refusal, entreated the Pope to desire Emmanuel, king of Portugal, to"
18274,STANZA X.,send no more fleets to the Indian seas. The Pope sent Maurus to
18275,STANZA X.,"Emmanuel, who returned a very spirited answer to his holiness, assuring"
18276,STANZA X.,"him that no threats, no dangers, could make him alter his resolutions,"
18277,STANZA X.,and lamenting that it had not yet been in his power to fulfil his
18278,STANZA X.,purpose of demolishing the sepulchre and erasing the memorials of
18279,STANZA X.,"Mohammed from the earth. This, he says was the first purpose of sending"
18280,STANZA X.,his fleets to India. It is with great art that Camoëns so often reminds
18281,STANZA X.,us of the grand design of the expedition of his heroes to subvert
18282,STANZA X.,"Mohammedanism, and found a Christian empire in the East. But the dignity"

18344,STANZA X.,"Sultan of Egypt, and the Grand Signior. The troops of these Mohammedan"
18345,STANZA X.,"princes were in the highest reputation for bravery, and though, composed"
18346,STANZA X.,"of many different nations, were known among the orientals by one common"
18347,STANZA X.,name. Ignorance delights in the marvellous. The history of ancient Rome
18348,STANZA X.,"made the same figure among the easterns, as that of the fabulous, or"
18349,STANZA X.,"heroic, ages does with us, with this difference, it was better believed."

18364,STANZA X.,"Albuquerque laid the plan, and Castro completed the system of the"
18365,STANZA X.,"Portuguese empire in the East. It is with propriety, therefore, that the"
18366,STANZA X.,prophecy given to GAMA is here summed up. Nor is the discretion of
18367,STANZA X.,Camoëns in this instance inferior to his judgment. He is now within a
18368,STANZA X.,"few years of his own times, when he himself was upon the scene in India."
18369,STANZA X.,But whatever he had said of his contemporaries would have been liable to
18370,STANZA X.,"misconstruction, and every sentence would have been branded with the"
18371,STANZA X.,epithets of flattery or malice. A little poet would have been happy in
18372,STANZA X.,such an opportunity to resent his wrongs. But the silent contempt of
18373,STANZA X.,Camoëns does him true honour.

18375,STANZA X.,"In this historical song, as already hinted, the translator has been"

18393,STANZA X.,"to us, he is going down to the more eastern; the difference being"

18395,STANZA X.,expressions of our poet are equally applicable to the Ptolemaic and
18396,STANZA X.,Copernican systems. The ancient hypothesis which made our earth the
18397,STANZA X.,"centre of the universe, is the system adopted by Camoëns, a happiness,"
18398,STANZA X.,"in the opinion of the translator, to the English Lusiad. The new system"

18400,STANZA X.,novelty to the English reader. The other has not only that advantage in
18401,STANZA X.,its favour: but this description is perhaps the finest and fullest that
18402,STANZA X.,"ever was given of it in poetry, that of Lucretius, l. v. being chiefly"
18403,STANZA X.,"argumentative, and therefore less picturesque."

18405,STANZA X.,"Our author studied at the university of Coimbra, where the ancient"
18406,STANZA X.,"system and other doctrines of the Aristotelians then, and long"
18407,STANZA X.,"afterward, prevailed."

18409,STANZA X.,[626] _He holds His loftiest state._--Called by the old philosophers and
18410,STANZA X.,school divines the sensorium of the Deity.
18411,STANZA X.,
18412,STANZA X.,"[627] _These spheres behold._--According to the Peripatetics, the"
18413,STANZA X.,universe consisted of eleven spheres inclosed within each other; as
18414,STANZA X.,Fanshaw has familiarly expressed it by a simile which he has lent our
18415,STANZA X.,"author. The first of these spheres, he says--"
18416,STANZA X.,
18417,STANZA X.,"""Doth (_as in a nest"
18418,STANZA X.,"Of boxes_) all the other orbs comprise."""
18419,STANZA X.,
18420,STANZA X.,"In their accounts of this first-mentioned, but eleventh, sphere, which"
18421,STANZA X.,"they called the Empyrean, or heaven of the blest, the disciples of"
18422,STANZA X.,"Aristotle, and the Arab Moors, gave loose to all the warmth of"
18423,STANZA X.,imagination. And several of the Christian fathers applied to it the
18424,STANZA X.,descriptions of heaven which are found in the Holy Scripture.
18425,STANZA X.,
18426,STANZA X.,"[628] _Hence motion darts its force._--This is the tenth sphere, the"
18427,STANZA X.,_Primum Mobile_ of the ancient system. To account for the appearances of
18428,STANZA X.,"the heavens, the Peripatetics ascribed a double motion to it. While its"
18429,STANZA X.,"influence drew the other orbs from east to west, they supposed it had a"
18430,STANZA X.,"motion of its own from west to east. To effect this, the ponderous"
18431,STANZA X.,"weight and interposition of the ninth sphere, or crystalline heaven, was"
18432,STANZA X.,necessary. The ancient astronomers observed that the stars shifted their
18433,STANZA X.,"places. This they called the motion of the crystalline heaven, expressed"
18434,STANZA X.,by our poet at the rate of one pace during two hundred solar years. The
18435,STANZA X.,"famous Arab astronomer, Abulhasan, in his Meadows of Gold, calculates"
18436,STANZA X.,"the revolution of this sphere to consist of 49,000 of our years. But"
18437,STANZA X.,"modern discoveries have not only corrected the calculation,{*} but have"
18438,STANZA X.,also ascertained the reason of the apparent motion of the fixed stars.
18439,STANZA X.,The earth is not a perfect sphere; the quantity of matter is greater at
18440,STANZA X.,"the equator; hence the earth turns on her axis in a rocking motion,"
18441,STANZA X.,"revolving round the axis of the ecliptic, which is called the procession"
18442,STANZA X.,"of the equinoxes, and makes the stars seem to shift their places at"
18443,STANZA X.,about the rate of a degree in 72 years; according to which all the stars
18444,STANZA X.,"seem to perform one revolution in the space of 25,920 years, after which"
18445,STANZA X.,they return exactly to the same situation as at the beginning of this
18446,STANZA X.,"period. However imperfect in their calculations, the Chaldean"
18447,STANZA X.,astronomers perceived that the motions of the heavens composed one great
18448,STANZA X.,"revolution. This they called the _annus magnus_, which those who did not"
18449,STANZA X.,understand them mistook for a restoration of all things to their first
18450,STANZA X.,originals.
18451,STANZA X.,
18452,STANZA X.,"{*} However deficient the astronomy of Abulhasan may be, it is nothing"
18453,STANZA X.,"to the calculation of his prophet Mohammed, who tells his disciples,"
18454,STANZA X.,"that the stars were each about the bigness of a house, and hung from the"
18455,STANZA X.,sky on chains of gold.
18456,STANZA X.,
18457,STANZA X.,"[629] _And binds the starry sphere._--This was called the firmament, or"
18458,STANZA X.,"eighth heaven. Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Apollo, Venus, Mercury, and Diana,"
18459,STANZA X.,"were the planets which gave name to, and whose orbits composed, the"
18460,STANZA X.,other spheres or heavens.
18461,STANZA X.,
18462,STANZA X.,[630] _In shining frost the Northern Chariot rides._--Commonly called
18463,STANZA X.,"Charles' Wain. Andromeda was the daughter of Cepheus, king of Ethiopia,"
18464,STANZA X.,and of Cassiope. Cassiope boasted that she and her daughter were more
18465,STANZA X.,"beautiful than Juno and the Nereids. Andromeda, to appease the goddess,"
18466,STANZA X.,"was, at her father's command, chained to a rock to be devoured by a sea"
18467,STANZA X.,"monster, but was saved by Perseus, who obtained of Jupiter that all the"
18468,STANZA X.,"family should be placed among the stars. Orion was a hunter, who, for an"
18469,STANZA X.,"attempt on Diana, was stung to death by a serpent. The star of his name"
18470,STANZA X.,portends tempests. The Dogs; fable gives this honour to those of
18471,STANZA X.,"different hunters. The faithful dog of Erigone, however, that died mad"
18472,STANZA X.,"with grief for the death of his mistress, has the best title to preside"
18473,STANZA X.,over the dog-days. The Swan; whose form Jupiter borrowed to enjoy Leda.
18474,STANZA X.,"The Hare, when pursued by Orion, was saved by Mercury, and placed in"
18475,STANZA X.,"heaven, to signify that Mercury presides over melancholy dispositions."
18476,STANZA X.,"The Lyre, with which Orpheus charmed Pluto. The Dragon which guarded the"
18477,STANZA X.,"golden apples of the Hesperides, and the ship Argo complete the number"
18478,STANZA X.,of the constellations mentioned by Camoëns. If our author has blended
18479,STANZA X.,"the appearances of heaven with those of the painted artificial sphere,"
18480,STANZA X.,"it is in the manner of the classics. Ovid, in particular, thus describes"
18481,STANZA X.,"the heavens, in the second book of his Metamorphoses."
18482,STANZA X.,
18483,STANZA X.,[631] _Such are their laws impress'd by God's dread will._--Though a
18484,STANZA X.,modern narrative of gallant adventures by no means requires the
18485,STANZA X.,"supposition of a particular Providence, that supposition, however, is"
18486,STANZA X.,absolutely necessary to the grandeur of an epic poem. The great examples
18487,STANZA X.,of Homer and Virgil prove it; and Camoëns understood and felt its force.
18488,STANZA X.,"While his fleet combat all the horrors of unploughed oceans, we do not"
18489,STANZA X.,view his heroes as idle wanderers; the care of heaven gives their voyage
18490,STANZA X.,the greatest importance. When GAMA falls on his knees and spreads his
18491,STANZA X.,"hands to heaven on the discovery of India, we are presented with a"
18492,STANZA X.,figure infinitely more noble than that of the most successful conqueror
18493,STANZA X.,who is supposed to act under the influence of fatalism or chance. The
18494,STANZA X.,human mind is conscious of its own weakness. It expects an elevation in
18495,STANZA X.,"poetry, and demands a degree of importance superior to the caprices of"
18496,STANZA X.,unmeaning accident. The poetical reader cannot admire the hero who is
18497,STANZA X.,"subject to such blind fortuity. He appears to us with an abject,"
18498,STANZA X.,uninteresting littleness. Our poetical ideas of permanent greatness
18499,STANZA X.,"demand a GAMA, a hero whose enterprises and whose person interest the"
18500,STANZA X.,care of Heaven and the happiness of his people. Nor must this
18501,STANZA X.,supposition be confined merely to the machinery. The reason why it
18502,STANZA X.,"pleases, also requires, that the supposition should be uniform"
18503,STANZA X.,"throughout the whole poem. Virgil, by dismissing Eneas through the ivory"
18504,STANZA X.,"gate of Elysium, has hinted that all his pictures of a future state were"
18505,STANZA X.,"merely dreams, and has thus destroyed the highest merit of the"
18506,STANZA X.,compliment to his patron Augustus. But Camoëns has certainly been more
18507,STANZA X.,happy. A fair opportunity offered itself to indulge the opinions of
18508,STANZA X.,"Lucretius and the Academic Grove; but Camoëns, in ascribing the"
18509,STANZA X.,"government of the universe to the will of God, has not only preserved"
18510,STANZA X.,"the philosophy of his poem perfectly uniform, but has also shown that"
18511,STANZA X.,"the Peripatetic system is, in this instance, exactly conformable to the"
18512,STANZA X.,Newtonian.
18513,STANZA X.,
18514,STANZA X.,"Though the Author of nature has placed man in a state of moral agency,"
18515,STANZA X.,"and made his happiness and misery to depend upon it, and though every"
18516,STANZA X.,page of human history is stained with the tears of injured innocence and
18517,STANZA X.,"the triumphs of guilt, with miseries which must affect a moral, or"
18518,STANZA X.,"thinking being, yet we have been told, that God perceiveth it not, and"
18519,STANZA X.,that what mortals call moral evil vanishes from before His more perfect
18520,STANZA X.,"sight. Thus the appeal of injured innocence, and the tear of bleeding"
18521,STANZA X.,"virtue fall unregarded, unworthy of the attention of the Deity.{*} Yet,"
18522,STANZA X.,with what raptures do these philosophers behold the infinite wisdom and
18523,STANZA X.,"care of Beelzebub, their god of flies, in the admirable and various"
18524,STANZA X.,"provision he has made for the preservation of the eggs of vermin, and"
18525,STANZA X.,the generation of maggots.{**}
18526,STANZA X.,
18527,STANZA X.,Much more might be said in proof that our poet's philosophy does not
18528,STANZA X.,"altogether deserve ridicule. And those who allow a general, but deny a"
18529,STANZA X.,"particular providence, will, it is hoped, excuse Camoëns, on the"
18530,STANZA X.,"consideration, that if we estimate a general moral providence by analogy"
18531,STANZA X.,"of that providence which presides over vegetable and animal nature, a"
18532,STANZA X.,more particular one cannot possibly be wanted. If a particular
18533,STANZA X.,"providence, however, is still denied, another consideration obtrudes"
18534,STANZA X.,"itself; if one pang of a moral agent is unregarded, one tear of injured"
18535,STANZA X.,"innocence left to fall unpitied by the Deity, if _Ludit in humanis"
18536,STANZA X.,"Divina potentia rebus_, the consequence is, that the human conception"
18537,STANZA X.,can form an idea of a much better God. And it may modestly be presumed
18538,STANZA X.,"we may hazard the laugh of the wisest philosopher, and without scruple"
18539,STANZA X.,"assert, that it is impossible that a created mind should conceive an"
18540,STANZA X.,idea of perfection superior to that which is possessed by the Creator
18541,STANZA X.,and Author of existence.
18542,STANZA X.,
18543,STANZA X.,"{*} Perhaps, like Lucretius, some philosophers think this would be too"
18544,STANZA X.,"much trouble to the Deity. But the idea of trouble to the Divine Nature,"
18545,STANZA X.,"is much the same as another argument of the same philosopher, who having"
18546,STANZA X.,"asserted, that before the creation the gods could not know what seed"
18547,STANZA X.,"would produce, from thence wisely concludes that the world was made by"
18548,STANZA X.,chance.

18550,STANZA X.,"{**} Ray, in his Wisdom of God in the Creation (though he did not deny a"
18551,STANZA X.,"Providence), has carried this extravagance to the highest pitch. ""To"
18552,STANZA X.,"give life,"" says he, ""is the intention of the creation; and how"
18553,STANZA X.,"wonderful does the goodness of God appear in this, that the death and"
18554,STANZA X.,"putrefaction of one animal is the life of thousands."" So, the misery of"

18608,STANZA X.,"King of Zeyla. Don Stephen sent his brother, Don Christoval with 500"
18609,STANZA X.,men. The prodigies of their valour astonished the Ethiopians. But after
18610,STANZA X.,"having twice defeated the tyrant, and reduced his great army to the last"
18611,STANZA X.,"extremity, Don Christoval, urged too far by the impetuosity of his"
18612,STANZA X.,"youthful valour, was taken prisoner. He was brought before the usurper,"
18613,STANZA X.,and put to death in the most cruel manner. Waxed threads were twisted
18614,STANZA X.,with his beard and afterwards set on fire. He was then dipped in boiling
18615,STANZA X.,"wax, and at last beheaded by the hand of the tyrant. The Portuguese"

18648,STANZA X.,the spirit of the old romance. Orlando having taken the first invented

18685,STANZA X.,we have already mentioned. The Jesuit missionaries have given most
18686,STANZA X.,pompous accounts of the Christian antiquities of India and China. When
18687,STANZA X.,"the Portuguese arrived in India, the head of the Malabar Christians,"
18688,STANZA X.,"named Jacob, styled himself Metropolitan of India and China. And a"
18689,STANZA X.,Syriac breviary{*} of the Indian Christians offers praise to God for
18690,STANZA X.,"sending St. Thomas to India and China. In 1625, in digging for a"
18691,STANZA X.,"foundation near Sigansu, metropolis of the province of Xensi, was found"
18692,STANZA X.,"a stone with a cross on it, full of Chinese, and some Syriac characters,"

18694,STANZA X.,"religion, ""that it was brought from Judea; that having been weakened, it"

18696,STANZA X.,"Christians, say the Jesuits, siding with the Tartars, cir. A.D. 1200,"
18697,STANZA X.,"were extirpated by the Chinese. In 1543, Fernand Pinto, observing some"
18698,STANZA X.,"ruins near Peking, was told by the people, that 200 years before, a holy"
18699,STANZA X.,"man who worshipped Jesus Christ, born of a virgin, lived there; and"
18700,STANZA X.,"being murdered, was thrown into a river, but his body would not sink;"
18701,STANZA X.,and soon after the city was destroyed by an earthquake. The same Jesuit
18702,STANZA X.,"found people at Caminam who knew the doctrines of Christianity, which"
18703,STANZA X.,"they said were preached to their fathers, by John, the disciple of"
18704,STANZA X.,"Thomas. In 1635, some heathens, by night passing through a village in"
18705,STANZA X.,"the province of Fokien, saw some stones which emitted light, under which"
18706,STANZA X.,"were found the figure of crosses. From China, St. Thomas returned to"
18707,STANZA X.,"Meliapore in Malabar, at a time when a prodigious beam of timber floated"
18708,STANZA X.,"on the sea near the coast. The king endeavoured to bring it ashore, but"
18709,STANZA X.,all the force of men and elephants was in vain. St. Thomas desired leave
18710,STANZA X.,"to build a church with it, and immediately dragged it to shore with a"
18711,STANZA X.,"single thread. A church was built, and the king baptized. This enraged"
18712,STANZA X.,"the Brahmins, the chief of whom killed his own son, and accused Thomas"
18713,STANZA X.,"of the murder. But the saint, by restoring the youth to life, discovered"
18714,STANZA X.,the wickedness of his enemies. He was afterwards killed by a lance while
18715,STANZA X.,"kneeling at the altar; after, according to tradition, he had built 3300"
18716,STANZA X.,"stately churches, many of which were rebuilt, cir. 800, by an Armenian"
18717,STANZA X.,"named Thomas Cananeus. In 1533, the body of the apostle, with the head"
18718,STANZA X.,"of the lance beside him, was found in his church by D. Duarte de"
18719,STANZA X.,"Meneses; and in 1558 was, by D. Constantine de Braganza, removed to Goa."
18720,STANZA X.,"To these accounts, selected from Faria y Sousa, let two from Osorius be"
18721,STANZA X.,"added. When Martin Alonzo de Souza was viceroy, some brazen tables were"
18722,STANZA X.,"brought to him, inscribed with unusual characters, which were explained"
18723,STANZA X.,"by a learned Jew, and imported that St. Thomas had built a church at"
18724,STANZA X.,"Meliapore. And by an account sent to Cardinal Henrico, by the Bishop of"
18725,STANZA X.,"Cochin, in 1562, when the Portuguese repaired the ancient chapel of St."
18726,STANZA X.,"Thomas,{**} there was found a stone cross with several characters on it,"
18727,STANZA X.,"which the best antiquarians could not interpret, till at last a Brahmin"
18728,STANZA X.,"translated it, ""That in the reign of Sagam, Thomas was sent by the Son"
18729,STANZA X.,"of God, whose disciple he was, to teach the law of heaven in India; that"
18730,STANZA X.,"he built a church, and was killed by a Brahmin at the altar."""
18731,STANZA X.,
18732,STANZA X.,{*} The existence of this breviary is a certain fact. These Christians
18733,STANZA X.,had the Scripture also in the Syriac language.
18734,STANZA X.,
18735,STANZA X.,"{**} This was a very ancient building, in the very first style of"
18736,STANZA X.,Christian churches. The Portuguese have now disfigured it with their
18737,STANZA X.,repairs and new buildings.
18738,STANZA X.,
18739,STANZA X.,"A view of Portuguese Asia, which must include the labours of the"
18740,STANZA X.,"Jesuits, forms a necessary part in the comment on the Lusiad: this note,"
18741,STANZA X.,"therefore, and some obvious reflections upon it, are in place. It is as"
18742,STANZA X.,"easy to bury an inscription and find it again, as it is to invent a"
18743,STANZA X.,"silly tale; but, though suspicion of fraud on the one hand, and silly"
18744,STANZA X.,"absurdity on the other, lead us to despise the authority of the Jesuits,"
18745,STANZA X.,yet one fact remains indisputable. Christianity had been much better
18746,STANZA X.,"known in the East, several centuries before, than it was at the arrival"
18747,STANZA X.,"of GAMA. Where the name was unknown, and where the Jesuits were"
18748,STANZA X.,"unconcerned, crosses were found. The long existence of the Christians of"
18749,STANZA X.,"St. Thomas in the midst of a vast pagan empire, proves that the learned"
18750,STANZA X.,of that kingdom must have some knowledge of their doctrines. And these
18751,STANZA X.,facts give countenance to some material conjectures concerning the
18752,STANZA X.,religion of the Brahmins.
18753,STANZA X.,
18754,STANZA X.,"[649] _When now the chief who wore the triple thread._--Of this, thus"
18755,STANZA X.,"Osorius: ""_Terna fila ab humero dextero in latus finistrum gerunt, ut"
18756,STANZA X.,designent trinam in natura divina rationem._--They (the Brahmins) wear
18757,STANZA X.,"three threads, which reach from the right shoulder to the left side, as"
18758,STANZA X.,"significant of the trinal distinction in the Divine Nature."" That some"
18759,STANZA X.,sects of the Brahmins wear a symbolical tessera of three threads is
18760,STANZA X.,"acknowledged on all hands; but, from whatever the custom arose, it is"
18761,STANZA X.,"not to be supposed that the Brahmins, who have thousands of ridiculous"
18762,STANZA X.,"contradictory legends, should agree in their accounts or explanations of"
18763,STANZA X.,it. They have various accounts of a Divine Person having assumed human
18764,STANZA X.,"nature. And the god Brahma, as observed by Cudworth, is generally"
18765,STANZA X.,"mentioned as united in the government of the universe with two others,"
18766,STANZA X.,sometimes of different names. They have also images with three heads
18767,STANZA X.,"rising out of one body, which they say represent the Divine Nature.{*}"
18768,STANZA X.,But are there any traces of these opinions in the accounts which the
18769,STANZA X.,Greek and Roman writers have given us of the Brahmins? And will the wise
18770,STANZA X.,pay any credit to the authority of those books which the public never
18771,STANZA X.,"saw, and which, by the obligation of their keepers, they are never to"
18772,STANZA X.,"see; and some of which, by the confession of their keepers, since the"
18773,STANZA X.,"appearance of Mohammed, have been rejected? The Platonic idea of a"
18774,STANZA X.,"trinity of divine attributes was well known to the ancients, yet perhaps"
18775,STANZA X.,the Athanasian controversy offers a fairer field to the conjecturist.
18776,STANZA X.,That controversy for several ages engrossed the conversation of the
18777,STANZA X.,"East. All the subtilty of the Greeks was called forth, and no"
18778,STANZA X.,speculative contest was ever more universally or warmly disputed; so
18779,STANZA X.,"warmly, that it is a certain fact that Mohammed, by inserting into his"
18780,STANZA X.,"Koran some declarations in favour of the Arians, gained innumerable"
18781,STANZA X.,"proselytes to his new religion. Abyssinia, Egypt, Syria, Persia, and"
18782,STANZA X.,"Armenia were perplexed with this unhappy dispute, and from the earliest"
18783,STANZA X.,times these countries have had a commercial intercourse with India. The
18784,STANZA X.,"number, blasphemy, and absurdity of the Jewish legends of the Talmud and"
18785,STANZA X.,"Targums, bear a striking resemblance to the holy legends of the"
18786,STANZA X.,Brahmins. The Jews also assert the great antiquity of their Talmudical
18787,STANZA X.,"legends. Adam, Enoch, and Noah are named among their authors; but we"
18788,STANZA X.,"know their date; Jerusalem, ere their birth, was destroyed by Titus. We"
18789,STANZA X.,"also know, that the accounts which the Greek writers give of the"
18790,STANZA X.,Brahmins fall infinitely short of those extravagances which are
18791,STANZA X.,confessed even by their modern admirers. And Mohammedanism does not
18792,STANZA X.,"differ from Christianity, more than the account which even these"
18793,STANZA X.,"gentlemen give, does from that of Porphyry. That laborious philosopher,"
18794,STANZA X.,"though possessed of all the knowledge of his age, though he mentions"
18795,STANZA X.,"their metempsychosis and penances, has not a word of any of their idols,"
18796,STANZA X.,"or the legends of Brahma or his brothers. On the contrary, he represents"
18797,STANZA X.,their worship as extremely pure and simple. Strabo's account of them is
18798,STANZA X.,"similar. And Eusebius has assured us they worshipped no images.{**} Yet,"
18799,STANZA X.,"on the arrival of the modern Europeans in India, innumerable were their"
18800,STANZA X.,"idols; and all the superstition of ancient Egypt, in the adoration of"
18801,STANZA X.,"animals and vegetables, seemed more than revived by the Brahmins. Who"
18802,STANZA X.,"that considers this striking alteration in their features, can withhold"
18803,STANZA X.,his contempt when he is told of the religious care with which these
18804,STANZA X.,philosophers have these four thousand years preserved their sacred
18805,STANZA X.,rites.

18807,STANZA X.,{*} To these undoubted facts the author will not add the authority of a
18808,STANZA X.,"Xavier, who tells us, that he prevailed upon a Brahmin to explain to him"

18828,STANZA X.,"[651] _Like him, ye Lusians, simplest Truth pursue._--It is now time to"
18829,STANZA X.,sum up what has been said of the labours of the Jesuits. Diametrically
18830,STANZA X.,opposite to this advice was their conduct in every Asiatic country where
18831,STANZA X.,they pretended to propagate the gospel. Sometimes we find an individual
18832,STANZA X.,"sincere and pious, but the great principle which always actuated them as"
18833,STANZA X.,"a united body was the lust of power and secular emolument, the"
18834,STANZA X.,possession of which they thought could not be better secured than by
18835,STANZA X.,rendering themselves of the utmost importance to the see of Rome. In
18836,STANZA X.,"consequence of these principles, wherever they came their first care was"
18837,STANZA X.,to find what were the great objects of the fear and adoration of the
18838,STANZA X.,"people. If the sun was esteemed the giver of life, Jesus Christ was the"
18839,STANZA X.,"Son of that luminary, and they were his younger brethren, sent to"
18840,STANZA X.,"instruct the ignorant. If the barbarians were in dread of evil spirits,"
18841,STANZA X.,"Jesus Christ came on purpose to banish them from the world, had driven"
18842,STANZA X.,"them from Europe,{*} and the Jesuits were sent to the East to complete"
18843,STANZA X.,his unfinished mission. If the Indian converts still retained a
18844,STANZA X.,"veneration for the powder of burned cow-dung, the Jesuits made the sign"
18845,STANZA X.,"of the cross over it, and the Indian besmeared himself with it as usual."
18846,STANZA X.,"Heaven, or universal matter, they told the Chinese, was the God of the"
18847,STANZA X.,"Christians, and the sacrifices of Confucius were solemnized in the"
18848,STANZA X.,"churches of the Jesuits. This worship of Confucius, Voltaire, with his"
18849,STANZA X.,"wonted accuracy, denies. But he ought to have known that this, with the"
18850,STANZA X.,"worship of _tien_, or heaven, had been long complained of at the court"
18851,STANZA X.,"of Rome (see Dupin), and that after the strictest scrutiny the charge"
18852,STANZA X.,"was fully proved, and Clement XI., in 1703, sent Cardinal Tournon to the"
18853,STANZA X.,small remains of the Jesuits in the East with a papal decree to reform
18854,STANZA X.,"these abuses. But the cardinal, soon after his arrival, was poisoned in"
18855,STANZA X.,"Siam by the holy fathers. Xavier, and the other Jesuits who succeeded"
18856,STANZA X.,"him, by the dexterous use of the great maxims of their master Loyola,"
18857,STANZA X.,"_Omnibus omnia, et omnia munda mundis_, gained innumerable proselytes."
18858,STANZA X.,"They contradicted none of the favourite opinions of their converts, they"
18859,STANZA X.,"only baptized, and gave them crucifixes to worship, and all was well."
18860,STANZA X.,But their zeal in uniting to the see of Rome the Christians found in the
18861,STANZA X.,East descended to the minutest particulars. And the native Christians of
18862,STANZA X.,Malabar were so violently persecuted as heretics that the heathen
18863,STANZA X.,"princes took arms in their defence in 1570 (see Geddes, Hist. Malabar),"
18864,STANZA X.,"and the Portuguese were almost driven from India. Abyssinia, by the same"
18865,STANZA X.,"arts, was steeped in blood, and two or three Abyssinian emperors lost"
18866,STANZA X.,their lives in endeavouring to establish the pope's supremacy. An order
18867,STANZA X.,"at last was given from the throne to hang every missionary, without"
18868,STANZA X.,"trial, wherever apprehended, the emperor himself complaining that he"
18869,STANZA X.,could not enjoy a day in quiet for the intrigues of the Romish friars.
18870,STANZA X.,"In China, also, they soon rendered themselves insufferable. Their skill"
18871,STANZA X.,"in mathematics and the arts introduced them to great favour at court,"
18872,STANZA X.,but all their cunning could not conceal their villainy. Their
18873,STANZA X.,unwillingness to ordain the natives raised suspicions against a
18874,STANZA X.,profession thus monopolized by strangers; their earnest zeal in amassing
18875,STANZA X.,"riches, and their interference with, and deep designs on, secular power"
18876,STANZA X.,"(the fatal rock on which they have so often been shipwrecked), appeared,"
18877,STANZA X.,"and their churches were levelled with the ground. About 90,000 of the"
18878,STANZA X.,"new converts, together with their teachers, were massacred, and their"
18879,STANZA X.,religion was prohibited. In Japan the rage of government even exceeded
18880,STANZA X.,"that of China, and in allusion to their chief object of adoration, the"
18881,STANZA X.,"cross, several of the Jesuit fathers were crucified by the Japanese, and"
18882,STANZA X.,the revival of the Christian name was interdicted by the severest laws.
18883,STANZA X.,"Thus, in a great measure, ended in the East the labours of the society"
18884,STANZA X.,"of Ignatius Loyola, a society which might have diffused the greatest"
18885,STANZA X.,"blessings to mankind, could honesty have been added to their great"
18886,STANZA X.,learning and abilities. Had that indefatigable zeal which laboured to
18887,STANZA X.,promote the interests of their own brotherhood and the Roman see been
18888,STANZA X.,"employed in the real interests of humanity and civilization, the great"
18889,STANZA X.,"design of diffusing the law of Heaven, challenged by its author as the"
18890,STANZA X.,"purpose of the Lusiad, would have been amply completed, and the remotest"
18891,STANZA X.,hordes of Tartary and Africa ere now had been happily civilized. But
18892,STANZA X.,"though the Jesuits have failed, they have afforded a noble lesson to"
18893,STANZA X.,mankind.

18953,STANZA X.,some denying and others asserting the existence of anthropophagi or

18955,STANZA X.,"and Derbices (people of north-eastern Asia), esteeming those most"
18956,STANZA X.,"miserable who died of sickness, when their parents and relations grew"
18957,STANZA X.,"old, killed and ate them, holding it more honourable thus to consume"
18958,STANZA X.,them than that they should be destroyed by vermin. St. Jerome has
18959,STANZA X.,"adopted this word for word, and has added to it an authority of his own:"
18960,STANZA X.,"""Quid loquar,"" says he, (Adv. Jov. l. 2, c. 6), ""de cæteris nationibus;"
18961,STANZA X.,"cum ipse adolescentulus in Gallia viderim Scotos, gentem Britannicam,"

18967,STANZA X.,"thing more than to fighten and to fie men, and to drynken gladlyest"
18968,STANZA X.,"mannes blood, which they clepen Dieu.""--P. 235. Yet, whatever absurdity"
18969,STANZA X.,may appear on the face of these tales; and what can be more absurd than
18970,STANZA X.,to suppose that a few wild Scots or Irish (for the name was then proper
18971,STANZA X.,"to Ireland), should so lord it in Gaul, as to eat the breasts of the"
18972,STANZA X.,"women and the hips of the shepherds? Yet, whatever absurdities our"
18973,STANZA X.,"Mandevylles may have obtruded on the public, the evidence of the fact is"
18974,STANZA X.,not thereby wholly destroyed. Though Dampier and other visitors of
18975,STANZA X.,barbarous nations have assured us that they never met with any
18976,STANZA X.,"man-eaters, and though Voltaire has ridiculed the opinion, yet one may"
18977,STANZA X.,"venture the assertion of their existence, without partaking of a"
18978,STANZA X.,"credulity similar to that of those foreigners, who believed that the men"
18979,STANZA X.,"of Kent were born with tails like sheep (see Lambert's Peramb.), the"
18980,STANZA X.,punishment inflicted upon them for the murder of Thomas à Becket. Many
18981,STANZA X.,"are the credible accounts, that different barbarous nations used to eat"
18982,STANZA X.,their prisoners of war. According to the authentic testimony of the best
18983,STANZA X.,"Portuguese writers, the natives of Brazil, on their high festivals,"
18984,STANZA X.,"brought forth their captives, and after many barbarous ceremonies, at"
18985,STANZA X.,last roasted and greedily devoured their mangled limbs. During his
18986,STANZA X.,"torture the unhappy victim prided himself in his manly courage,"
18987,STANZA X.,"upbraiding their want of skill in the art of tormenting, and telling his"
18988,STANZA X.,murderers that his belly had been the grave of many of their relations.
18989,STANZA X.,Thus the fact was certain long before a late voyage discovered the
18990,STANZA X.,horrid practice in New Zealand. To drink human blood has been more
18991,STANZA X.,common. The Gauls and other ancient nations practised it. When
18992,STANZA X.,"Magalhaens proposed Christianity to the King of Subo, a north-eastern"
18993,STANZA X.,"Asiatic island, and when Francis de Castro discovered Santigana and"
18994,STANZA X.,"other islands, a hundred leagues north of the Moluccas, the conversion"
18995,STANZA X.,of their kings was confirmed by each party drinking of the blood of the
18996,STANZA X.,"other. Our poet Spenser tells us, in his View of the State of Ireland,"
18997,STANZA X.,"that he has seen the Irish drink human blood, particularly, he adds, ""at"
18998,STANZA X.,"the execution of a notable traitor at Limerick, called Murrogh O'Brien,"
18999,STANZA X.,"I saw an old woman, who was his foster-mother, take up his head whilst"
19000,STANZA X.,"he was quartering and suck up all the blood that run thereout, saying,"
19001,STANZA X.,"that the earth was not worthy to drink it, and therewith also steeped"
19002,STANZA X.,"her face and breast and tore her hair, crying out and shrieking most"
19003,STANZA X.,"terribly."" It is worthy of regard that the custom of marking themselves"
19004,STANZA X.,"with hot irons, and tattooing, is characteristic both of the Guios of"
19005,STANZA X.,"Camoëns and of the present inhabitants of New Zealand. And if, as its"
19006,STANZA X.,"animals indicate, the island of Otaheite was first peopled by a"
19007,STANZA X.,"shipwreck, the friendship existing in a small society might easily"
19008,STANZA X.,"obliterate the memory of one custom, while the less unfriendly one of"
19009,STANZA X.,"tattooing was handed down, a memorial that they owed their origin to the"
19010,STANZA X.,"north-eastern parts of Asia, where that custom particularly prevails."

19016,STANZA X.,[659] _Other worlds the souls of beasts receive._--That Queen Elizabeth
19017,STANZA X.,"reigned in England, is not more certain than that the most ignorant"
19018,STANZA X.,nations in all ages have had the idea of a state after death. The same
19019,STANZA X.,"faculty which is conscious of existence whispers the wish for it; and,"
19020,STANZA X.,so little acquainted with the deductions of reasoning have some tribes
19021,STANZA X.,"been, that not only their animals, but even the ghosts of their domestic"
19022,STANZA X.,utensils have been believed to accompany them to the islands of the
19023,STANZA X.,"blessed. Long ere the voice of philosophy was heard, the opinion of an"
19024,STANZA X.,after state was popular in Greece. The works of Homer bear incontestable
19025,STANZA X.,evidence of this. And there is not a feature in the history of the human
19026,STANZA X.,"mind better ascertained, than that no sooner did speculation seize upon"
19027,STANZA X.,"the topic, than belief declined, and, as the great Bacon observes, the"
19028,STANZA X.,"most learned, became the most atheistical ages. The reason of this is"
19029,STANZA X.,"obvious. While the human mind is all simplicity, popular opinion is"
19030,STANZA X.,"cordially received; but, when reasoning begins, proof is expected, and"
19031,STANZA X.,"deficiency of demonstration being perceived, doubt and disbelief"
19032,STANZA X.,"naturally follow. Yet, strange as it may appear, if the writer's memory"
19033,STANZA X.,"does not greatly deceive him, these certain facts were denied by Hobbes."
19034,STANZA X.,"If he is not greatly mistaken, that gentleman, who gave a wretched, a"
19035,STANZA X.,"most unpoetical translation of Homer, has so grossly misunderstood his"
19036,STANZA X.,"author, as to assert that his mention of a future state was not in"
19037,STANZA X.,"conformity to the popular opinion of his age, but only his own poetical"
19038,STANZA X.,"fiction. He might as well have assured us, that the sacrifices of Homer"
19039,STANZA X.,"had never any existence in Greece. But, as no absurdity is too gross for"
19040,STANZA X.,"some geniuses, our murderer of Homer, our Hobbes, has likewise asserted,"
19041,STANZA X.,that the belief of the immortality of the human soul was the child of
19042,STANZA X.,"pride and speculation, unknown in Greece till long after the appearance"
19043,STANZA X.,of the Iliad.

19048,STANZA X.,fortune during the remainder of his life. The literal rendering of the

19055,STANZA X.,[661] _Here ere the cannon's rage in Europe roar'd._--According to Le
19056,STANZA X.,"Comte's memoirs of China, and those of other travellers, the mariner's"
19057,STANZA X.,"compass, fire-arms, and printing were known in that empire, long ere the"
19058,STANZA X.,"invention of these arts in Europe. But the accounts of Du Halde, Le"
19059,STANZA X.,"Comte, and the other Jesuits, are by no means to be depended on. It was"
19060,STANZA X.,their interest (in order to gain credit in Europe and at the court of
19061,STANZA X.,"Rome) to magnify the splendour of the empire where their mission lay,"
19062,STANZA X.,"and they have magnified it into romance itself. It is pretended, that"
19063,STANZA X.,"the Chinese used fire-arms in their wars with Zenghis Khan, and"
19064,STANZA X.,Tamerlane; but it is also said that the Sogdians used cannon against
19065,STANZA X.,Alexander. The mention of any sulphurous composition in an old writer
19066,STANZA X.,"is, with some, immediately converted into a regular tire of artillery."
19067,STANZA X.,"The Chinese, indeed, on the first arrival of Europeans, had a kind of"
19068,STANZA X.,"mortars, which they called fire-pans, but they were utter strangers to"
19069,STANZA X.,"the smaller fire-arms. Verbiest, a Jesuit, was the first who taught them"
19070,STANZA X.,"to make brass cannon, set upon wheels. And, even so late as the hostile"
19071,STANZA X.,"menace which Anson gave them, they knew not how to level, or manage,"
19072,STANZA X.,"their ordnance to any advantage. Their printing is, indeed, much more"
19073,STANZA X.,"ancient than that of Europe, but it does not deserve the same name, the"
19074,STANZA X.,blocks of wood with which they stamp their sheets being as inferior to
19075,STANZA X.,as they are different from the movable types of Europe. The Chinese have
19076,STANZA X.,"no idea of the graces of fine writing; here, most probably, the fault"
19077,STANZA X.,exists in their language; but the total want of nature in their
19078,STANZA X.,"painting, and of symmetry in their architecture, in both of which they"
19079,STANZA X.,"have so long been experienced, afford a heavy accusation against their"
19080,STANZA X.,"genius. But, in planning gardens, and in the art of beautifying the face"
19081,STANZA X.,"of their country, they are unequalled. Yet, even in their boasted"
19082,STANZA X.,"gardening their genius stands accused. The art of ingrafting, so long"
19083,STANZA X.,"known to Europe, is still unknown to them. And hence their fruits are"
19084,STANZA X.,vastly inferior in flavour to those of the western world. The amazing
19085,STANZA X.,"wall of defence against the Tartars, though 1500 miles in extent, is a"
19086,STANZA X.,"labour inferior to the canals, lined on the sides with hewn stone, which"
19087,STANZA X.,"everywhere enrich, and adorn their country; some of which reach 1000"
19088,STANZA X.,"miles, and are of depth to carry vessels of burthen. These grand remains"
19089,STANZA X.,of antiquity prove that there was a time when the Chinese were a much
19090,STANZA X.,more accomplished people than at present. Though their princes for many
19091,STANZA X.,"centuries have discovered no such efforts of genius as these, the"
19092,STANZA X.,"industry of the people still remains, in which they rival, and resemble,"
19093,STANZA X.,the Dutch. In every other respect they are the most unamiable of
19094,STANZA X.,"mankind. Amazingly uninventive, for, though possessed of them, the arts"
19095,STANZA X.,have made no progress among the Chinese these many centuries: even what
19096,STANZA X.,they were taught by the Jesuits is almost lost. So false in their
19097,STANZA X.,"dealings, they boast that none but a Chinese can cheat a Chinese. The"
19098,STANZA X.,"crime which disgraces human nature, is in this nation of atheists, and"
19099,STANZA X.,"most stupid of all idolaters, common as _that charter'd libertine, the"
19100,STANZA X.,"air_. Destitute, even in idea, of that elevation of soul which is"
19101,STANZA X.,"expressed by the best sense of the word piety, in the time of calamity"
19102,STANZA X.,"whole provinces are desolated by self-murder; an end, as Hume says, of"
19103,STANZA X.,"some of the admired names of antiquity, not unworthy of so detestable a"
19104,STANZA X.,"character. And, as it is always found congenial to baseness of heart,"
19105,STANZA X.,the most dastardly cowardice completes the description of that of the
19106,STANZA X.,Chinese.
19107,STANZA X.,
19108,STANZA X.,Unimproved as their arts is their learning. Though their language
19109,STANZA X.,"consists of few words, it is almost impossible for a stranger to attain"
19110,STANZA X.,the art of speaking it. And what a European learns ere he is seven years
19111,STANZA X.,"old, to read, is the labour of the life of a Chinese. In place of our 24"
19112,STANZA X.,"letters, they have more than 60,000 marks, which compose their writings:"
19113,STANZA X.,"and their paucity of words, all of which may be attained in a few hours,"
19114,STANZA X.,"requires such an infinite variety of tone and action, that the slightest"
19115,STANZA X.,mistake in modulation renders the speaker unintelligible. And in
19116,STANZA X.,"addressing a great man, in place of ""my Lord,"" you may call him a"
19117,STANZA X.,"_beast_, the word being the some, all the difference consisting in the"
19118,STANZA X.,tone of it. A language like this must ever be a bar to the progress and
19119,STANZA X.,accomplishments of literature. Of medicine they are very ignorant. The
19120,STANZA X.,"ginseng, which they pretended was a universal remedy, is found to be a"
19121,STANZA X.,"root of no singular virtue. Their books consist of odes without poetry,"
19122,STANZA X.,"and of moral maxims, excellent in themselves, but without investigation"
19123,STANZA X.,"or reasoning. For, to philosophical discussion and metaphysics they seem"
19124,STANZA X.,"utterly strangers; and, when taught mathematics by the Jesuits, their"
19125,STANZA X.,greatest men were lost in astonishment. Whatever their political wisdom
19126,STANZA X.,"has been, at present it is narrow and barbarous. Jealous lest strangers"
19127,STANZA X.,"should steal their arts--arts which are excelled at Dresden, and other"
19128,STANZA X.,parts of Europe--they preclude themselves from the great advantages
19129,STANZA X.,"which arise from an intercourse with civilized nations. Yet, in the laws"
19130,STANZA X.,which they impose on every foreign ship which enters their ports for
19131,STANZA X.,"traffic, they even exceed the cunning and avarice of the Dutch. In their"
19132,STANZA X.,internal policy the military government of Rome under the emperors is
19133,STANZA X.,"revived, with accumulated barbarism. In every city and province the"
19134,STANZA X.,military are the constables and peace officers. What a picture is this!
19135,STANZA X.,Nothing but Chinese or Dutch industry could preserve the traffic and
19136,STANZA X.,"population of a country under the control of armed ruffians. But, hence"
19137,STANZA X.,"the emperor has leisure to cultivate his gardens, and to write"
19138,STANZA X.,despicable odes to his concubines.
19139,STANZA X.,
19140,STANZA X.,"Whatever was their most ancient doctrine, certain it is that the"
19141,STANZA X.,legislators who formed the present system of China presented to their
19142,STANZA X.,"people no other object of worship than _Tien Kamti_, the material"
19143,STANZA X.,heavens and their influencing power; by which an intelligent principle
19144,STANZA X.,"is excluded. Yet, finding that the human mind in the rudest breasts is"
19145,STANZA X.,"conscious of its weakness, and prone to believe the occurrences of life"
19146,STANZA X.,"under the power of lucky or unlucky observances, they permitted their"
19147,STANZA X.,people the use of sacrifices to those Lucretian gods of superstitious
19148,STANZA X.,"fear. Nor was the principle of devotion, imprinted by Heaven in the"
19149,STANZA X.,"human heart, alone perverted; another unextinguishable passion was also"
19150,STANZA X.,"misled. On tablets, in every family, are written the names of the last"
19151,STANZA X.,"three of their ancestors, added to each, ""Here rests his soul:"" and"
19152,STANZA X.,"before these tablets they burn incense, and pay adoration. Confucius,"
19153,STANZA X.,"who, according to their histories, had been in the West about 500 years"
19154,STANZA X.,"before the Christian era, appears to be only the confirmer of their old"
19155,STANZA X.,opinions; but the accounts of him and his doctrine are involved in
19156,STANZA X.,"uncertainty. In their places of worship, however, boards are act up,"
19157,STANZA X.,"inscribed, ""This is the seat of the soul of Confucius,"" and to these,"
19158,STANZA X.,"and their ancestors, they celebrate solemn sacrifices, without seeming"
19159,STANZA X.,to possess any idea of the intellectual existence of the departed soul.
19160,STANZA X.,"The Jesuit Ricci, and his brethren of the Chinese mission, _very"
19161,STANZA X.,"honestly_ told their converts, that _Tien_ was the God of the"
19162,STANZA X.,"Christians, and that the label of Confucius was the term by which they"
19163,STANZA X.,"expressed His divine majesty. But, after a long and severe scrutiny at"
19164,STANZA X.,"the court of Rome, Tien was found to signify nothing more than"
19165,STANZA X.,"_heavenly_ or _universal matter_, and the Jesuits of China were ordered"
19166,STANZA X.,to renounce this heresy. Among all the sects who worship different idols
19167,STANZA X.,"in China, there is only one which has any tolerable idea of the"
19168,STANZA X.,"immortality of the soul; and among these, says Leland, Christianity at"
19169,STANZA X.,present obtains some footing. But the most interesting particular of
19170,STANZA X.,"China yet remains to be mentioned. Conscious of the obvious tendency,"
19171,STANZA X.,Voltaire and others have triumphed in the great antiquity of the
19172,STANZA X.,"Chinese, and in the distant period they ascribe to the creation. But the"
19173,STANZA X.,bubble cannot bear the touch. If some Chinese accounts fix the era of
19174,STANZA X.,"creation 40000 years ago, others are contented with no less than 884953."
19175,STANZA X.,But who knows not that every nation has its Geoffry of Monmouth? And we
19176,STANZA X.,have already observed the legends which took their rise from the Annus
19177,STANZA X.,"Magnus of the Chaldean and Egyptian astronomers, an apparent revolution"
19178,STANZA X.,"of the stars, which in reality has no existence. To the fanciful who"
19179,STANZA X.,"held this Annus Magnus, it seemed hard to suppose that our world was in"
19180,STANZA X.,"its first revolution of the great year, and to suppose that many were"
19181,STANZA X.,"past was easy. And, that this was the case, we have absolute proof in"
19182,STANZA X.,"the doctrines of the Brahmins, who, though they talk of hundreds of"
19183,STANZA X.,"thousands of years which are past, yet confess, that this, the fourth"
19184,STANZA X.,"world, has not yet attained its 6000th year. And much within this"
19185,STANZA X.,compass are all the credible proofs of Chinese antiquity comprehended.
19186,STANZA X.,To three heads all three proofs are reduceable--their form of
19187,STANZA X.,"government, which, till the conquest of the Tartars in 1644, bore the"
19188,STANZA X.,marks of the highest antiquity; their astronomical observations; and
19189,STANZA X.,their history.
19190,STANZA X.,
19191,STANZA X.,"Simply and purely patriarchal, every father was the magistrate in his"
19192,STANZA X.,"own family; and the emperor, who acted by his substitutes, the"
19193,STANZA X.,"Mandarins, was venerated and obeyed as the father of all. The most"
19194,STANZA X.,passive submission to authority thus branched out was inculcated by
19195,STANZA X.,"Confucius, and their other philosophers, as the greatest duty of"
19196,STANZA X.,"morality. But, if there is an age in sacred or profane history where the"
19197,STANZA X.,"manners of mankind are thus delineated, no superior antiquity is proved"
19198,STANZA X.,by the form of Chinese government. Their ignorance of the very ancient
19199,STANZA X.,"art of ingrafting fruit-trees, and the state of their language (like the"
19200,STANZA X.,"Hebrew in its paucity of words), a paucity characteristic of the ages"
19201,STANZA X.,"when the ideas of men required few syllables to clothe them, prove"
19202,STANZA X.,nothing farther than the early separation of the Chinese colony{*} from
19203,STANZA X.,"the rest of mankind; nothing farther, except that they have continued"
19204,STANZA X.,till very lately without any material intercourse with the other nations
19205,STANZA X.,of the world.
19206,STANZA X.,
19207,STANZA X.,"{*} The Chinese colony! Yes, let philosophy smile; let her talk of the"
19208,STANZA X.,different species of men which are found in every country; let her brand
19209,STANZA X.,"as absurd the opinion of Montesquieu, which derives all the human race"
19210,STANZA X.,"from one family. Let her enjoy her triumph. Peace to her insolence,"
19211,STANZA X.,peace to her dreams and her reveries. But let common sense be contented
19212,STANZA X.,"with the demonstration (See Whiston, Bentley, etc.) that a creation in"
19213,STANZA X.,"every country is not wanted, and that one family is sufficient in every"
19214,STANZA X.,respect for the purpose. If philosophy will talk of black and white men
19215,STANZA X.,"as different in species, let common sense ask her for a demonstration,"
19216,STANZA X.,that climate and manner of life cannot produce this difference; and let
19217,STANZA X.,"her add, that there is the strongest presumptive experimental proof that"
19218,STANZA X.,the difference thus happens. If philosophy draw her inferences from the
19219,STANZA X.,"different passions of different tribes; let common sense reply, that"
19220,STANZA X.,"stripped of every accident of brutalization and urbanity, the human mind"
19221,STANZA X.,"in all its faculties, all its motives, hopes and fears, is most"
19222,STANZA X.,wonderfully the same in every age and country. If philosophy talk of the
19223,STANZA X.,impossibility of peopling distant islands and continents from one
19224,STANZA X.,"family, let common sense tell her to read Bryant's Mythology. If"
19225,STANZA X.,"philosophy asserts that the Kelts wherever they came found aborigines,"
19226,STANZA X.,"let common sense reply, there were tyrants enough almost 2000 years"
19227,STANZA X.,"before their emigrations, to drive the wretched survivors of slaughtered"
19228,STANZA X.,"hosts to the remotest wilds. She may also add, that many islands have"
19229,STANZA X.,"been found which bore not one trace of mankind, and that even Otaheite"
19230,STANZA X.,"bears the evident marks of receiving its inhabitants from a shipwreck,"
19231,STANZA X.,"its only animals being the hog, the dog, and the rat. In a word, let"
19232,STANZA X.,"common sense say to philosophy, ""I open my egg with a pen-knife, but you"
19233,STANZA X.,"open yours with the blow of a sledge hammer."""
19234,STANZA X.,
19235,STANZA X.,"A continued succession of astronomical observations, for 4000 years, was"
19236,STANZA X.,"claimed by the Chinese, when they were first visited by the Europeans."
19237,STANZA X.,"Voltaire, that _son of truth_, has often with great triumph mentioned"
19238,STANZA X.,the indubitable proofs of Chinese antiquity; but at these times he must
19239,STANZA X.,have received his information from the same dream which told him that
19240,STANZA X.,Camoëns accompanied his friend GAMA in the voyage which discovered the
19241,STANZA X.,East Indies. If Voltaire and his disciples will talk of Chinese
19242,STANZA X.,"astronomy, and the 4000 years antiquity of its perfection, let them"
19243,STANZA X.,enjoy every consequence which may possibly result from it. But let them
19244,STANZA X.,allow the same liberty to others. Let them allow others to draw _their_
19245,STANZA X.,"inferences from a few stubborn facts, facts which demonstrate the"
19246,STANZA X.,"ignorance of the Chinese in astronomy. The earth, they imagined, was a"
19247,STANZA X.,"great plain, of which their country was the midst; and so ignorant were"
19248,STANZA X.,"they of the cause of eclipses, that they believed the sun and moon were"
19249,STANZA X.,"assaulted, and in danger of being devoured by a huge dragon. The stars"
19250,STANZA X.,"were considered as the directors of human affairs, and thus their"
19251,STANZA X.,"boasted astronomy ends in that silly imposition, judicial astrology."
19252,STANZA X.,Though they had made some observations on the revolutions of the
19253,STANZA X.,"planets, and though in the emperor's palace there was an observatory,"
19254,STANZA X.,the first apparatus of proper instruments ever known in China was
19255,STANZA X.,"introduced by Father Verbiest. After this it need scarcely be added,"
19256,STANZA X.,that their astronomical observations which pretend an antiquity of 4000
19257,STANZA X.,"years, are as false as a Welch genealogy, and that the Chinese"
19258,STANZA X.,"themselves, when instructed by the Jesuits, were obliged to own that"
19259,STANZA X.,their calculations were erroneous and impossible. The great credit and
19260,STANZA X.,admiration which their astronomical and mathematical knowledge procured
19261,STANZA X.,"to the Jesuits, afford an indubitable confirmation of these facts."
19262,STANZA X.,
19263,STANZA X.,"Ridiculous as their astronomical, are their historical antiquities."
19264,STANZA X.,"After all Voltaire has said of it, the oldest date to which their"
19265,STANZA X.,history pretends is not much above 4000 years. During this period 236
19266,STANZA X.,"kings have reigned, of 22 different families. The first king reigned 100"
19267,STANZA X.,"years, then we have the names of some others, but without any detail of"
19268,STANZA X.,"actions, or that concatenation of events which distinguishes authentic"
19269,STANZA X.,history. That mark of truth does not begin to appear for upwards of 2000
19270,STANZA X.,"years of the Chinese legends. Little more than the names of kings, and"
19271,STANZA X.,"these often interrupted with wide chasms, compose all the annals of"
19272,STANZA X.,"China, till about the period of the Christian era. Something like a"
19273,STANZA X.,"history then commences, but that is again interrupted by a wide chasm,"
19274,STANZA X.,"which the Chinese know not how to fill up otherwise, than by asserting"
19275,STANZA X.,"that a century or two elapsed in the time, and that at such a period a"
19276,STANZA X.,"new family mounted the throne. Such is the history of China, full"
19277,STANZA X.,"brother in every family feature to those Monkish tales, which sent a"
19278,STANZA X.,"daughter of Pharoah to be queen of Scotland, which sent Brutus to"
19279,STANZA X.,"England, and a grandson of Noah to teach school among the mountains in"
19280,STANZA X.,Wales.

19285,STANZA X.,"While the other pagans of Asia worship the most ugly monstrous idols,"
19286,STANZA X.,the Tartars of Thibet adore a real living god. He sits cross-legged on
19287,STANZA X.,"his throne, in the great temple, adorned with gold and diamonds. He"
19288,STANZA X.,"never speaks, but sometimes elevates his hand in token that he approves"
19289,STANZA X.,"of the prayers of his worshippers. He is a ruddy well-looking young man,"
19290,STANZA X.,"about 25 or 27, and is the most miserable wretch on earth, being the"
19291,STANZA X.,"mere puppet of his priests, who dispatch him whenever age or sickness"
19292,STANZA X.,"make any alteration in his features; and another, instructed to act his"
19293,STANZA X.,"part, is put in his place. Princes of very distant provinces send"
19294,STANZA X.,"tribute to this deity and implore his blessing, and, as Voltaire has"
19295,STANZA X.,"merrily told us, think themselves secure of benediction if favoured with"
19296,STANZA X.,"something from his godship, esteemed more sacred than the hallowed"
19297,STANZA X.,cow-dung of the Brahmins.

19300,STANZA X.,"by Castera) Camoëns alludes to the great success, which in his time"
19301,STANZA X.,attended the Jesuit missionaries in Japan. James I. sent an embassy to
19302,STANZA X.,"the sovereign, and opened a trade with this country, but it was soon"
19303,STANZA X.,suffered to decline. The Dutch are the only Europeans who now traffic
19304,STANZA X.,"with the Japanese, which it is said they obtain by trampling on the"
19305,STANZA X.,cross and by abjuring the Christian name. In religion the Japanese are
19306,STANZA X.,much the same as their neighbours of China. And in the frequency of
19307,STANZA X.,"self-murder, says Voltaire, they vie with their brother islanders of"

19310,STANZA X.,[664] _The ground they touch not._--These are commonly called the birds
19311,STANZA X.,of Paradise. It was the old erroneous opinion that they always soared in
19312,STANZA X.,"the air, and that the female hatched her young on the back of the male."
19313,STANZA X.,"Their feathers bear a mixture of the most beautiful azure, purple, and"
19314,STANZA X.,"golden colours, which have a fine effect in the rays of the sun."
19315,STANZA X.,
19316,STANZA X.,[665] _From hence the pilgrim brings the wondrous tale._--Streams of
19317,STANZA X.,this kind are common in many countries. Castera attributes this quality
19318,STANZA X.,"to the excessive coldness of the waters, but this is a mistake. The"
19319,STANZA X.,"waters of some springs are impregnated with sparry particles, which"
19320,STANZA X.,"adhering to the herbage, or the clay, on the banks of their channel,"
19321,STANZA X.,"harden into stone, and incrust the original retainers."
19322,STANZA X.,
19323,STANZA X.,"[666] _Here from the trees the gum._--Benzoin, a species of"
19324,STANZA X.,"frankincense. The oil mentioned in the next line, is that called the"
19325,STANZA X.,"rock oil, petroleum, a black fetid mineral oil, good for bruises and"
19326,STANZA X.,sprains.
19327,STANZA X.,
19328,STANZA X.,"[667] _Wide forests there beneath Maldivia's tide._--A sea plant,"
19329,STANZA X.,"resembling the palm, grows in great abundance in the bays about the"
19330,STANZA X.,"Maldivian islands. The boughs rise to the top of the water, and bear a"
19331,STANZA X.,"kind of apple, called the coco of Maldivia, which is esteemed an"
19332,STANZA X.,antidote against poison.
19333,STANZA X.,
19334,STANZA X.,[668] _The tread of sainted footstep._--The imprint of a human foot is
19335,STANZA X.,"found on the high mountain, called the Pic of Adam. Legendary tradition"
19336,STANZA X.,"says, that Adam, after he was expelled from Paradise, did penance 300"
19337,STANZA X.,"years on this hill, on which he left the print of his footstep. This"
19338,STANZA X.,"tale seems to be Jewish, or Mohammedan; for the natives, according to"
19339,STANZA X.,"Captain Knox (who was twenty years a captive in Ceylon), pretend the"
19340,STANZA X.,"impression was made by the god Budha, when he ascended to heaven, after"
19341,STANZA X.,"having, for the salvation of mankind, appeared on the earth. His priests"
19342,STANZA X.,"beg charity for the sake of Budha, whose worship they perform among"
19343,STANZA X.,"groves of the Bogahah-tree, under which, when on earth, they say he"
19344,STANZA X.,usually sat and taught.
19345,STANZA X.,
19346,STANZA X.,"[669] _And lo, the Island of the Moon._--Madagascar is thus named by the"

19350,STANZA X.,
19351,STANZA X.,"[671] _Now to the West, by thee, great chief, is given._--The sublimity"
19352,STANZA X.,of this eulogy on the expedition of the Lusiad has been already
19353,STANZA X.,"observed. What follows is a natural completion of the whole; and, the"
19354,STANZA X.,"digressive exclamation at the end excepted, is exactly similar to the"
19355,STANZA X.,manner in which Homer has concluded the Iliad.
19356,STANZA X.,
19357,STANZA X.,[672] _Near either pole._--We are now presented with a beautiful view of
19358,STANZA X.,"the American world. Columbus discovered the West Indies before, but not"
19359,STANZA X.,the continent till 1498--the year after GAMA sailed from Lisbon.
19360,STANZA X.,
19361,STANZA X.,"[673] _The first bold hero._--Cabral, the first after GAMA who sailed to"
19362,STANZA X.,"India, was driven by tempest to the Brazils, a proof that more ancient"
19363,STANZA X.,voyagers might have met with the same fate. He named the country Santa
19364,STANZA X.,"Cruz, or Holy Cross; it was afterwards named Brazil, from the colour of"
19365,STANZA X.,the wood with which it abounds. It is one of the finest countries in the
19366,STANZA X.,new world.
19367,STANZA X.,
19368,STANZA X.,"[674] _To match thy deeds shall Magalhaens aspire._--Camoëns, though he"
19369,STANZA X.,"boasts of the actions of Magalhaens as an honour to Portugal, yet"
19370,STANZA X.,"condemns his defection to the King of Spain, and calls him--"
19371,STANZA X.,
19372,STANZA X.,"_O Magalhaens, no feito com verdade"
19373,STANZA X.,"Portuguez, porèm naó na lealdade._"
19374,STANZA X.,
19375,STANZA X.,"""In deeds truly a Portuguese, but not in loyalty."" And others have"
19376,STANZA X.,"bestowed upon him the name of traitor, but perhaps undeservedly. Justice"
19377,STANZA X.,to the name of this great man requires an examination of the charge. Ere
19378,STANZA X.,"he entered into the service of the King of Spain by a solemn act, he"
19379,STANZA X.,unnaturalized himself. Osorius is very severe against this unavailing
19380,STANZA X.,"rite, and argues that no injury which a prince may possibly give, can"
19381,STANZA X.,authorize a subject to act the part of a traitor against his native
19382,STANZA X.,"country. This is certainly true, but it is not strictly applicable to"
19383,STANZA X.,the case of Magalhaens. Many eminent services performed in Africa and
19384,STANZA X.,"India entitled him to a certain allowance, which, though inconsiderable"
19385,STANZA X.,"in itself, was esteemed as the reward of distinguished merit, and"
19386,STANZA X.,therefore highly valued. For this Magalhaens petitioned in vain. He
19387,STANZA X.,"found, says Faria, that the malicious accusations of some men had more"
19388,STANZA X.,weight with his sovereign than all his services. After this unworthy
19389,STANZA X.,"repulse, what patronage at the Court of Lisbon could he hope? And though"
19390,STANZA X.,no injury can vindicate the man who draws his sword against his native
19391,STANZA X.,"country, yet no moral duty requires that he who has some important"
19392,STANZA X.,"discovery in meditation should stifle his design, if uncountenanced by"
19393,STANZA X.,"his native prince. It has been alleged, that he embroiled his country in"
19394,STANZA X.,disputes with Spain. But neither is this strictly applicable to the
19395,STANZA X.,neglected Magalhaens. The courts of Spain and Portugal had solemnly
19396,STANZA X.,settled the limits within which they were to make discoveries and
19397,STANZA X.,"settlements, and within these did Magalhaens and the court of Spain"
19398,STANZA X.,propose that his discoveries should terminate. And allowing that his
19399,STANZA X.,calculations might mislead him beyond the bounds prescribed to the
19400,STANZA X.,"Spaniards, still his apology is clear, for it would have been injurious"
19401,STANZA X.,"to each court, had he supposed that the faith of the boundary treaty"
19402,STANZA X.,would be trampled upon by either power. If it is said that he
19403,STANZA X.,"aggrandized the enemies of his country, the Spaniards, and introduced"
19404,STANZA X.,them to a dangerous rivalship with the Portuguese settlements; let the
19405,STANZA X.,"sentence of Faria on this subject be remembered: ""Let princes beware,"""
19406,STANZA X.,"says he, ""how by neglect or injustice they force into desperate actions"
19407,STANZA X.,"the men who have merited rewards."""
19408,STANZA X.,
19409,STANZA X.,"In the end of the 15th and beginning of the 16th centuries, the spirit"
19410,STANZA X.,of discovery broke forth in its greatest vigour. The East and the West
19411,STANZA X.,had been visited by GAMA and Columbus; and the bold idea of sailing to
19412,STANZA X.,"the East by the West was revived by Magalhaens. Revived, for misled by"
19413,STANZA X.,"Strabo and Pliny, who place India near to the west of Spain, Columbus"
19414,STANZA X.,expecting to find the India of the ancients when he landed on
19415,STANZA X.,"Hispaniola, thought he had discovered the Ophir of Solomon. And hence"
19416,STANZA X.,the name of Indies was given to that and the neighbouring islands.
19417,STANZA X.,Though America and the Moluccas were now found to be at a great
19418,STANZA X.,"distance, the genius of Magalhaens still suggested the possibility of a"
19419,STANZA X.,"western passage. And accordingly, possessed of his great design, and"
19420,STANZA X.,"neglected with contempt at home, he offered his service to the court of"
19421,STANZA X.,"Spain, and was accepted. With five ships and 250 men he sailed from"
19422,STANZA X.,"Spain in September, 1519, and after many difficulties, occasioned by"
19423,STANZA X.,"mutiny and the extreme cold, he entered the great Pacific Ocean or South"
19424,STANZA X.,Seas by those straits which bear his Spanish name Magellan. From these
19425,STANZA X.,"straits, in the 52-1/2 degree of southern latitude, he traversed that"
19426,STANZA X.,"great ocean, till in the 10th degree of north latitude he landed on the"
19427,STANZA X.,island of Subo or Marten. The king of this country was then at war with
19428,STANZA X.,"a neighbouring prince, and Magalhaens, on condition of his conversion to"
19429,STANZA X.,"Christianity, became his auxiliary. In two battles the Spaniards were"
19430,STANZA X.,"victorious, but in the third, Magalhaens, together with one Martinho, a"
19431,STANZA X.,"judicial astrologer, whom he usually consulted, was unfortunately"
19432,STANZA X.,"killed. Chagrined with the disappointment of promised victory, the new"
19433,STANZA X.,"baptised king of Subo made peace with his enemies, and having invited to"
19434,STANZA X.,"an entertainment the Spaniards on shore, he treacherously poisoned them"
19435,STANZA X.,all. The wretched remains of the fleet arrived at the Portuguese
19436,STANZA X.,"settlements in the isles of Banda and Ternate, where they were received,"
19437,STANZA X.,"says Faria, as friends, and not as intruding strangers; a proof that the"
19438,STANZA X.,boundary treaty was esteemed sufficiently sacred. Several of the
19439,STANZA X.,"adventurers were sent to India, and from thence to Spain, in Portuguese"
19440,STANZA X.,"ships, one ship only being in a condition to return to Europe by the"
19441,STANZA X.,"Cape of Good Hope. This vessel, named the _Victoria_, however, had the"
19442,STANZA X.,honour to be the first which ever surrounded the globe; an honour by
19443,STANZA X.,some ignorantly attributed to the ship of Sir Francis Drake. Thus
19444,STANZA X.,"unhappily ended, says Osorius, the expedition of Magalhaens. But the"
19445,STANZA X.,"good bishop was mistaken, for a few years after he wrote, and somewhat"
19446,STANZA X.,"upwards of fifty after the return of the _Victoria_, Philip II. of Spain"
19447,STANZA X.,availed himself of the discoveries of Magalhaens. And the navigation of
19448,STANZA X.,"the South Seas between Spanish America and the Asian Archipelago, at"
19449,STANZA X.,"this day forms the basis of the power of Spain: a basis, however, which"
19450,STANZA X.,"is at the mercy of Great Britain, while her ministers are wise enough to"
19451,STANZA X.,preserve her great naval superiority. A Gibraltar in the South Seas is
19452,STANZA X.,"only wanting. But when this is mentioned, who can withhold his eyes from"
19453,STANZA X.,the isthmus of Darien--the rendezvous appointed by nature for the fleets
19454,STANZA X.,which may one day give law to the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans: a
19455,STANZA X.,"settlement which to-day might have owned subjection to Great Britain, if"
19456,STANZA X.,justice and honour had always presided in the cabinet of William the
19457,STANZA X.,Third?
19458,STANZA X.,
19459,STANZA X.,[675] _A land of giants._--The Patagonians. Various are the fables of
19460,STANZA X.,navigators concerning these people. The Spaniards who went with
19461,STANZA X.,"Magalhaens affirmed they were about ten feet in height, since which"
19462,STANZA X.,"voyage they have risen and fallen in their stature, according to the"
19463,STANZA X.,different humours of our sea wits.
19464,STANZA X.,
19465,STANZA X.,[676] _The goddess spake._--We are now come to the conclusion of the
19466,STANZA X.,"fiction of the island of Venus, a fiction which is divided into three"
19467,STANZA X.,"principal parts. In each of these the poetical merit is obvious, nor"
19468,STANZA X.,"need we fear to assert, that the happiness of our author, in uniting all"
19469,STANZA X.,"these parts together in one great episode, would have excited the"
19470,STANZA X.,admiration of Longinus. The heroes of the Lusiad receive their reward in
19471,STANZA X.,"the Island of Love. They are led to the palace of Thetis, where, during"
19472,STANZA X.,"a divine feast, they hear the glorious victories and conquests of the"
19473,STANZA X.,"heroes who are to succeed them in their Indian expedition, sung by a"
19474,STANZA X.,"siren; and the face of the globe itself, described by the goddess,"
19475,STANZA X.,"discovers the universe, and particularly the extent of the eastern"
19476,STANZA X.,"world, now given to Europe by the success of GAMA. Neither in grandeur,"
19477,STANZA X.,"nor in happiness of completion, may the Æneid or Odyssey be mentioned in"
19478,STANZA X.,"comparison. The Iliad alone, in epic conduet (as already observed) bears"
19479,STANZA X.,a strong resemblance. But however great in other views of poetical
19480,STANZA X.,"merit, the games at the funeral of Patroclus, and the redemption of the"
19481,STANZA X.,"body of Hector, considered as the interesting conclusion of a great"
19482,STANZA X.,"whole, can never in propriety and grandeur be brought into competition"
19483,STANZA X.,with the admirable episode which concludes the poem on the discovery of
19484,STANZA X.,India.
19485,STANZA X.,
19486,STANZA X.,"Soon after the appearance of the Lusiad, the language of Spain was also"
19487,STANZA X.,"enriched with an heroic poem, the author of which has often imitated the"
19488,STANZA X.,"Portuguese poet, particularly in the fiction of the globe of the world,"
19489,STANZA X.,"which is shown to GAMA. In the _Araucana_, a globe, surrounded with a"
19490,STANZA X.,"radiant sphere, is also miraculously supported in the air; and on this"
19491,STANZA X.,an enchanter shows to the Spaniards the extent of their dominions in the
19492,STANZA X.,"new world. But Don Alonzo d'Arcilla is in this, as in every other part"
19493,STANZA X.,"of his poem, greatly inferior to the poetical spirit of Camoëns. Milton,"
19494,STANZA X.,"whose poetical conduct in concluding the action of his Paradise Lost, as"
19495,STANZA X.,"already pointed out, seems formed upon the Lusiad, appears to have had"
19496,STANZA X.,"this passage particularly in his eye. For, though the machinery of a"
19497,STANZA X.,visionary sphere was rather improper for the situation of his
19498,STANZA X.,"personages, he has, nevertheless, though at the expense of an impossible"
19499,STANZA X.,"supposition, given Adam a view of the terrestrial globe. Michael sets"
19500,STANZA X.,the father of mankind on a mountain--

19516,STANZA X.,"And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat"

19518,STANZA X.,"Guiana, whose great city Geryon's sons"
19519,STANZA X.,"Call El Dorado."""
19520,STANZA X.,
19521,STANZA X.,"It must also be owned by the warmest admirer of the Paradise Lost, that"
19522,STANZA X.,the description of America in Camoëns--

19528,STANZA X.,"And cold beneath the southern pole-star ends,"""
19529,STANZA X.,
19530,STANZA X.,conveys a bolder and a grander idea than all the names enumerated by
19531,STANZA X.,Milton.
19532,STANZA X.,
19533,STANZA X.,Some short account of the writers whose authorities have been adduced in
19534,STANZA X.,the course of these notes may not now be improper. Fernando Lopez de
19535,STANZA X.,"Castagneda went to India on purpose to do honour to his countrymen, by"
19536,STANZA X.,enabling himself to record their actions and conquests in the East. As
19537,STANZA X.,"he was one of the first writers on that subject, his geography is often"
19538,STANZA X.,"imperfect. This defect is remedied in the writings of John de Barros,"
19539,STANZA X.,"who was particularly attentive to this head. But the two most eminent,"
19540,STANZA X.,"as well as fullest, writers on the transaction of the Portuguese in the"
19541,STANZA X.,"East, are Manuel de Faria y Sousa, knight of the Order of Christ, and"
19542,STANZA X.,"Hieronimus Osorius, bishop of Sylves. Faria, who wrote in Spanish, was a"
19543,STANZA X.,"laborious inquirer, and is very full and circumstantial. With honest"
19544,STANZA X.,indignation he rebukes the rapine of commanders and the errors and
19545,STANZA X.,"unworthy resentments of kings. But he is often so drily particular, that"
19546,STANZA X.,he may rather be called a journalist than an historian. And by this
19547,STANZA X.,"uninteresting minuteness, his style, for the greatest part, is rendered"
19548,STANZA X.,"inelegant. The Bishop of Sylves, however, claims a different character."
19549,STANZA X.,"His Latin is elegant, and his manly and sentimental manner entitles him"
19550,STANZA X.,"to the name of historian, even where a Livy or a Tacitus are mentioned."
19551,STANZA X.,"But a sentence from himself, unexpected in a father of the communion of"
19552,STANZA X.,"Rome, will characterize the liberality of his mind. Talking of the edict"
19553,STANZA X.,"of King Emmanuel, which compelled the Jews to embrace Christianity under"
19554,STANZA X.,"severe persecution: ""Nec ex lege, nec ex religione factum ... tibi"
19555,STANZA X.,"assumas,"" says he, ""ut libertatem voluntatis impedias, et vincula"
19556,STANZA X.,"mentibus effrenatis injicias? At id neque fleri potest, neque Christi"
19557,STANZA X.,sanctissimum numen approbat. Voluntarium enim sacrificium non vi malo
19558,STANZA X.,"coactum ab hominibus expetit: neque vim mentibus inferri, sed voluntates"
19559,STANZA X.,"ad studium veræ religionis allici et invitari jubet."""
19560,STANZA X.,
19561,STANZA X.,"It is said, in the preface to Osorius, that his writings were highly"
19562,STANZA X.,"esteemed by Queen Mary of England, wife of Philip II. What a pity is it,"
19563,STANZA X.,that this manly indignation of the good bishop against the impiety of
19564,STANZA X.,"religious persecution, made no impression on the mind of that bigoted"
19565,STANZA X.,princess!
19566,STANZA X.,
19567,STANZA X.,"[677] _And the wide East is doom'd to Lusian sway._--Thus, in all the"
19568,STANZA X.,"force of ancient simplicity, and the true sublime, ends the poem of"
19569,STANZA X.,Camoëns. What follows is one of those exuberances we have already
19570,STANZA X.,"endeavoured to defend in our author, nor in the strictest sense is this"
19571,STANZA X.,concluding one without propriety. A part of the proposition of the poem
19572,STANZA X.,"is artfully addressed to King Sebastian, and he is now called upon in an"
19573,STANZA X.,"address (which is an artful second part to the former), to behold and"
19574,STANZA X.,preserve the glories of his throne.

19586,STANZA X.,
19587,STANZA X.,"Similarity of condition, we have already observed, produced similarity"
19588,STANZA X.,of complaint and sentiment in Spenser and Camoëns. Each was unworthily
19589,STANZA X.,"neglected by the grandees of his age, yet both their names will live,"
19590,STANZA X.,when the remembrance of the courtiers who spurned them shall _sink
19591,STANZA X.,beneath their mountain tombs_. These beautiful stanzas from Phinehas
19592,STANZA X.,"Fletcher on the memory of Spenser, may also serve as an epitaph for"
19593,STANZA X.,"Camoëns. The unworthy neglect, which was the lot of the Portuguese bard,"
19594,STANZA X.,but too well appropriates to him the elegy of Spenser. And every reader
19595,STANZA X.,"of taste, who has perused the Lusiad, will think of the Cardinal"
