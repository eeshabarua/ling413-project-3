36,CANTO V,"Now had I left those spirits, and pursued"
37,CANTO V,"The steps of my Conductor, when beheld"
38,CANTO V,Pointing the finger at me one exclaim'd:
39,CANTO V,"""See how it seems as if the light not shone"
40,CANTO V,"From the left hand of him beneath, and he,"
41,CANTO V,"As living, seems to be led on.""  Mine eyes"
42,CANTO V,"I at that sound reverting, saw them gaze"
43,CANTO V,"Through wonder first at me, and then at me"
44,CANTO V,"And the light broken underneath, by turns."
45,CANTO V,"""Why are thy thoughts thus riveted?""  my guide"
46,CANTO V,"Exclaim'd, ""that thou hast slack'd thy pace? or how"
47,CANTO V,"Imports it thee, what thing is whisper'd here?"
48,CANTO V,"Come after me, and to their babblings leave"
49,CANTO V,"The crowd. Be as a tower, that, firmly set,"
50,CANTO V,Shakes not its top for any blast that blows!
51,CANTO V,"He, in whose bosom thought on thought shoots out,"
52,CANTO V,"Still of his aim is wide, in that the one"
53,CANTO V,"Sicklies and wastes to nought the other's strength."""
54,CANTO V,
55,CANTO V,"What other could I answer save ""I come?"""
56,CANTO V,"I said it, somewhat with that colour ting'd"
57,CANTO V,Which ofttimes pardon meriteth for man.
58,CANTO V,
59,CANTO V,"Meanwhile traverse along the hill there came,"
60,CANTO V,"A little way before us, some who sang"
61,CANTO V,"The ""Miserere"" in responsive Strains."
62,CANTO V,When they perceiv'd that through my body I
63,CANTO V,"Gave way not for the rays to pass, their song"
64,CANTO V,Straight to a long and hoarse exclaim they chang'd;
65,CANTO V,"And two of them, in guise of messengers,"
66,CANTO V,"Ran on to meet us, and inquiring ask'd:"
67,CANTO V,"""Of your condition we would gladly learn."""
68,CANTO V,
69,CANTO V,"To them my guide.  ""Ye may return, and bear"
70,CANTO V,"Tidings to them who sent you, that his frame"
71,CANTO V,"Is real flesh.  If, as I deem, to view"
72,CANTO V,"His shade they paus'd, enough is answer'd them."
73,CANTO V,"Him let them honour, they may prize him well."""
74,CANTO V,
75,CANTO V,Ne'er saw I fiery vapours with such speed
76,CANTO V,"Cut through the serene air at fall of night,"
77,CANTO V,"Nor August's clouds athwart the setting sun,"
78,CANTO V,That upward these did not in shorter space
79,CANTO V,"Return; and, there arriving, with the rest"
80,CANTO V,"Wheel back on us, as with loose rein a troop."
81,CANTO V,
82,CANTO V,"""Many,"" exclaim'd the bard, ""are these, who throng"
83,CANTO V,Around us: to petition thee they come.
84,CANTO V,"Go therefore on, and listen as thou go'st."""
85,CANTO V,
86,CANTO V,"""O spirit! who go'st on to blessedness"
87,CANTO V,"With the same limbs, that clad thee at thy birth."""
88,CANTO V,"Shouting they came, ""a little rest thy step."
89,CANTO V,Look if thou any one amongst our tribe
90,CANTO V,"Hast e'er beheld, that tidings of him there"
91,CANTO V,"Thou mayst report.  Ah, wherefore go'st thou on?"
92,CANTO V,Ah wherefore tarriest thou not?  We all
93,CANTO V,"By violence died, and to our latest hour"
94,CANTO V,"Were sinners, but then warn'd by light from heav'n,"
95,CANTO V,"So that, repenting and forgiving, we"
96,CANTO V,"Did issue out of life at peace with God,"
97,CANTO V,"Who with desire to see him fills our heart."""
98,CANTO V,
99,CANTO V,"Then I: ""The visages of all I scan"
100,CANTO V,"Yet none of ye remember.  But if aught,"
101,CANTO V,"That I can do, may please you, gentle spirits!"
102,CANTO V,"Speak; and I will perform it, by that peace,"
103,CANTO V,Which on the steps of guide so excellent
104,CANTO V,"Following from world to world intent I seek."""
105,CANTO V,
106,CANTO V,"In answer he began: ""None here distrusts"
107,CANTO V,"Thy kindness, though not promis'd with an oath;"
108,CANTO V,So as the will fail not for want of power.
109,CANTO V,"Whence I, who sole before the others speak,"
110,CANTO V,"Entreat thee, if thou ever see that land,"
111,CANTO V,Which lies between Romagna and the realm
112,CANTO V,"Of Charles, that of thy courtesy thou pray"
113,CANTO V,"Those who inhabit Fano, that for me"
114,CANTO V,"Their adorations duly be put up,"
115,CANTO V,By which I may purge off my grievous sins.
116,CANTO V,"From thence I came.  But the deep passages,"
117,CANTO V,"Whence issued out the blood wherein I dwelt,"
118,CANTO V,Upon my bosom in Antenor's land
119,CANTO V,"Were made, where to be more secure I thought."
120,CANTO V,"The author of the deed was Este's prince,"
121,CANTO V,"Who, more than right could warrant, with his wrath"
122,CANTO V,"Pursued me.  Had I towards Mira fled,"
123,CANTO V,"When overta'en at Oriaco, still"
124,CANTO V,"Might I have breath'd. But to the marsh I sped,"
125,CANTO V,And in the mire and rushes tangled there
126,CANTO V,"Fell, and beheld my life-blood float the plain."""
127,CANTO V,
128,CANTO V,"Then said another: ""Ah! so may the wish,"
129,CANTO V,"That takes thee o'er the mountain, be fulfill'd,"
130,CANTO V,As thou shalt graciously give aid to mine.
131,CANTO V,Of Montefeltro I; Buonconte I:
132,CANTO V,"Giovanna nor none else have care for me,"
133,CANTO V,"Sorrowing with these I therefore go.""  I thus:"
134,CANTO V,"""From Campaldino's field what force or chance"
135,CANTO V,"Drew thee, that ne'er thy sepulture was known?"""
136,CANTO V,
137,CANTO V,"""Oh!""  answer'd he, ""at Casentino's foot"
138,CANTO V,"A stream there courseth, nam'd Archiano, sprung"
139,CANTO V,In Apennine above the Hermit's seat.
140,CANTO V,"E'en where its name is cancel'd, there came I,"
141,CANTO V,"Pierc'd in the heart, fleeing away on foot,"
142,CANTO V,And bloodying the plain.  Here sight and speech
143,CANTO V,"Fail'd me, and finishing with Mary's name"
144,CANTO V,"I fell, and tenantless my flesh remain'd."
145,CANTO V,I will report the truth; which thou again
146,CANTO V,"Tell to the living.  Me God's angel took,"
147,CANTO V,"Whilst he of hell exclaim'd: ""O thou from heav'n!"
148,CANTO V,Say wherefore hast thou robb'd me?  Thou of him
149,CANTO V,Th' eternal portion bear'st with thee away
150,CANTO V,For one poor tear that he deprives me of.
151,CANTO V,"But of the other, other rule I make."""
152,CANTO V,
153,CANTO V,"""Thou knowest how in the atmosphere collects"
154,CANTO V,"That vapour dank, returning into water,"
155,CANTO V,Soon as it mounts where cold condenses it.
156,CANTO V,"That evil will, which in his intellect"
157,CANTO V,"Still follows evil, came, and rais'd the wind"
158,CANTO V,"And smoky mist, by virtue of the power"
159,CANTO V,"Given by his nature.  Thence the valley, soon"
160,CANTO V,"As day was spent, he cover'd o'er with cloud"
161,CANTO V,"From Pratomagno to the mountain range,"
162,CANTO V,"And stretch'd the sky above, so that the air"
163,CANTO V,"Impregnate chang'd to water.  Fell the rain,"
164,CANTO V,And to the fosses came all that the land
165,CANTO V,"Contain'd not; and, as mightiest streams are wont,"
166,CANTO V,To the great river with such headlong sweep
167,CANTO V,"Rush'd, that nought stay'd its course.  My stiffen'd frame"
168,CANTO V,"Laid at his mouth the fell Archiano found,"
169,CANTO V,"And dash'd it into Arno, from my breast"
170,CANTO V,"Loos'ning the cross, that of myself I made"
171,CANTO V,"When overcome with pain.  He hurl'd me on,"
172,CANTO V,Along the banks and bottom of his course;
173,CANTO V,"Then in his muddy spoils encircling wrapt."""
174,CANTO V,
175,CANTO V,"""Ah! when thou to the world shalt be return'd,"
176,CANTO V,"And rested after thy long road,"" so spake"
177,CANTO V,"Next the third spirit; ""then remember me."
178,CANTO V,"I once was Pia.  Sienna gave me life,"
179,CANTO V,"Maremma took it from me.  That he knows,"
180,CANTO V,"Who me with jewell'd ring had first espous'd."""
181,CANTO V,
182,CANTO V,
183,CANTO VI,CANTO VI
184,CANTO VI,
185,CANTO VI,"When from their game of dice men separate,"
186,CANTO VI,"He, who hath lost, remains in sadness fix'd,"
187,CANTO VI,"Revolving in his mind, what luckless throws"
188,CANTO VI,He cast: but meanwhile all the company
189,CANTO VI,"Go with the other; one before him runs,"
190,CANTO VI,"And one behind his mantle twitches, one"
191,CANTO VI,Fast by his side bids him remember him.
192,CANTO VI,"He stops not; and each one, to whom his hand"
193,CANTO VI,"Is stretch'd, well knows he bids him stand aside;"
194,CANTO VI,And thus he from the press defends himself.
195,CANTO VI,E'en such was I in that close-crowding throng;
196,CANTO VI,"And turning so my face around to all,"
197,CANTO VI,"And promising, I 'scap'd from it with pains."
198,CANTO VI,
199,CANTO VI,"Here of Arezzo him I saw, who fell"
200,CANTO VI,"By Ghino's cruel arm; and him beside,"
201,CANTO VI,Who in his chase was swallow'd by the stream.
202,CANTO VI,"Here Frederic Novello, with his hand"
203,CANTO VI,"Stretch'd forth, entreated; and of Pisa he,"
204,CANTO VI,Who put the good Marzuco to such proof
205,CANTO VI,Of constancy.  Count Orso I beheld;
206,CANTO VI,And from its frame a soul dismiss'd for spite
207,CANTO VI,"And envy, as it said, but for no crime:"
208,CANTO VI,"I speak of Peter de la Brosse; and here,"
209,CANTO VI,"While she yet lives, that Lady of Brabant"
210,CANTO VI,Let her beware; lest for so false a deed
211,CANTO VI,She herd with worse than these. When I was freed
212,CANTO VI,"From all those spirits, who pray'd for others' prayers"
213,CANTO VI,To hasten on their state of blessedness;
214,CANTO VI,"Straight I began: ""O thou, my luminary!"
215,CANTO VI,"It seems expressly in thy text denied,"
216,CANTO VI,That heaven's supreme decree can never bend
217,CANTO VI,To supplication; yet with this design
218,CANTO VI,"Do these entreat.  Can then their hope be vain,"
219,CANTO VI,"Or is thy saying not to me reveal'd?"""
220,CANTO VI,
221,CANTO VI,"He thus to me: ""Both what I write is plain,"
222,CANTO VI,"And these deceiv'd not in their hope, if well"
223,CANTO VI,"Thy mind consider, that the sacred height"
224,CANTO VI,"Of judgment doth not stoop, because love's flame"
225,CANTO VI,"In a short moment all fulfils, which he"
226,CANTO VI,"Who sojourns here, in right should satisfy."
227,CANTO VI,"Besides, when I this point concluded thus,"
228,CANTO VI,By praying no defect could be supplied;
229,CANTO VI,Because the pray'r had none access to God.
230,CANTO VI,Yet in this deep suspicion rest thou not
231,CANTO VI,"Contented unless she assure thee so,"
232,CANTO VI,Who betwixt truth and mind infuses light.
233,CANTO VI,I know not if thou take me right; I mean
234,CANTO VI,"Beatrice.  Her thou shalt behold above,"
235,CANTO VI,"Upon this mountain's crown, fair seat of joy."""
236,CANTO VI,
237,CANTO VI,"Then I: ""Sir! let us mend our speed; for now"
238,CANTO VI,I tire not as before; and lo! the hill
239,CANTO VI,"Stretches its shadow far.""  He answer'd thus:"
240,CANTO VI,"""Our progress with this day shall be as much"
241,CANTO VI,As we may now dispatch; but otherwise
242,CANTO VI,Than thou supposest is the truth.  For there
243,CANTO VI,"Thou canst not be, ere thou once more behold"
244,CANTO VI,"Him back returning, who behind the steep"
245,CANTO VI,"Is now so hidden, that as erst his beam"
246,CANTO VI,Thou dost not break.  But lo! a spirit there
247,CANTO VI,"Stands solitary, and toward us looks:"
248,CANTO VI,"It will instruct us in the speediest way."""
249,CANTO VI,
250,CANTO VI,We soon approach'd it.  O thou Lombard spirit!
251,CANTO VI,"How didst thou stand, in high abstracted mood,"
252,CANTO VI,Scarce moving with slow dignity thine eyes!
253,CANTO VI,"It spoke not aught, but let us onward pass,"
254,CANTO VI,Eyeing us as a lion on his watch.
255,CANTO VI,"But Virgil with entreaty mild advanc'd,"
256,CANTO VI,Requesting it to show the best ascent.
257,CANTO VI,"It answer to his question none return'd,"
258,CANTO VI,But of our country and our kind of life
259,CANTO VI,"Demanded.  When my courteous guide began,"
260,CANTO VI,"""Mantua,"" the solitary shadow quick"
261,CANTO VI,"Rose towards us from the place in which it stood,"
262,CANTO VI,"And cry'd, ""Mantuan! I am thy countryman"
263,CANTO VI,"Sordello.""  Each the other then embrac'd."
264,CANTO VI,
265,CANTO VI,"Ah slavish Italy! thou inn of grief,"
266,CANTO VI,"Vessel without a pilot in loud storm,"
267,CANTO VI,"Lady no longer of fair provinces,"
268,CANTO VI,"But brothel-house impure! this gentle spirit,"
269,CANTO VI,Ev'n from the Pleasant sound of his dear land
270,CANTO VI,Was prompt to greet a fellow citizen
271,CANTO VI,With such glad cheer; while now thy living ones
272,CANTO VI,In thee abide not without war; and one
273,CANTO VI,"Malicious gnaws another, ay of those"
274,CANTO VI,"Whom the same wall and the same moat contains,"
275,CANTO VI,"Seek, wretched one! around thy sea-coasts wide;"
276,CANTO VI,"Then homeward to thy bosom turn, and mark"
277,CANTO VI,If any part of the sweet peace enjoy.
278,CANTO VI,"What boots it, that thy reins Justinian's hand"
279,CANTO VI,"Befitted, if thy saddle be unpress'd?"
280,CANTO VI,Nought doth he now but aggravate thy shame.
281,CANTO VI,"Ah people! thou obedient still shouldst live,"
282,CANTO VI,"And in the saddle let thy Caesar sit,"
283,CANTO VI,If well thou marked'st that which God commands.
284,CANTO VI,
285,CANTO VI,Look how that beast to felness hath relaps'd
286,CANTO VI,"From having lost correction of the spur,"
287,CANTO VI,"Since to the bridle thou hast set thine hand,"
288,CANTO VI,"O German Albert! who abandon'st her,"
289,CANTO VI,"That is grown savage and unmanageable,"
290,CANTO VI,When thou should'st clasp her flanks with forked heels.
291,CANTO VI,Just judgment from the stars fall on thy blood!
292,CANTO VI,And be it strange and manifest to all!
293,CANTO VI,Such as may strike thy successor with dread!
294,CANTO VI,"For that thy sire and thou have suffer'd thus,"
295,CANTO VI,"Through greediness of yonder realms detain'd,"
296,CANTO VI,The garden of the empire to run waste.
297,CANTO VI,"Come see the Capulets and Montagues,"
298,CANTO VI,The Philippeschi and Monaldi! man
299,CANTO VI,"Who car'st for nought! those sunk in grief, and these"
300,CANTO VI,"With dire suspicion rack'd. Come, cruel one!"
301,CANTO VI,"Come and behold the' oppression of the nobles,"
302,CANTO VI,And mark their injuries: and thou mayst see.
303,CANTO VI,What safety Santafiore can supply.
304,CANTO VI,"Come and behold thy Rome, who calls on thee,"
305,CANTO VI,Desolate widow! day and night with moans:
306,CANTO VI,"""My Caesar, why dost thou desert my side?"""
307,CANTO VI,Come and behold what love among thy people:
308,CANTO VI,"And if no pity touches thee for us,"
309,CANTO VI,"Come and blush for thine own report.  For me,"
310,CANTO VI,"If it be lawful, O Almighty Power,"
311,CANTO VI,Who wast in earth for our sakes crucified!
312,CANTO VI,Are thy just eyes turn'd elsewhere? or is this
313,CANTO VI,A preparation in the wond'rous depth
314,CANTO VI,"Of thy sage counsel made, for some good end,"
315,CANTO VI,Entirely from our reach of thought cut off?
316,CANTO VI,So are the' Italian cities all o'erthrong'd
317,CANTO VI,"With tyrants, and a great Marcellus made"
318,CANTO VI,Of every petty factious villager.
319,CANTO VI,
320,CANTO VI,My Florence! thou mayst well remain unmov'd
321,CANTO VI,"At this digression, which affects not thee:"
322,CANTO VI,"Thanks to thy people, who so wisely speed."
323,CANTO VI,"Many have justice in their heart, that long"
324,CANTO VI,"Waiteth for counsel to direct the bow,"
325,CANTO VI,Or ere it dart unto its aim: but shine
326,CANTO VI,Have it on their lip's edge.  Many refuse
327,CANTO VI,To bear the common burdens: readier thine
328,CANTO VI,"Answer uneall'd, and cry, ""Behold I stoop!"""
329,CANTO VI,
330,CANTO VI,"Make thyself glad, for thou hast reason now,"
331,CANTO VI,Thou wealthy! thou at peace! thou wisdom-fraught!
332,CANTO VI,Facts best witness if I speak the truth.
333,CANTO VI,"Athens and Lacedaemon, who of old"
334,CANTO VI,"Enacted laws, for civil arts renown'd,"
335,CANTO VI,Made little progress in improving life
336,CANTO VI,"Tow'rds thee, who usest such nice subtlety,"
337,CANTO VI,That to the middle of November scarce
338,CANTO VI,Reaches the thread thou in October weav'st.
339,CANTO VI,"How many times, within thy memory,"
340,CANTO VI,"Customs, and laws, and coins, and offices"
341,CANTO VI,"Have been by thee renew'd, and people chang'd!"
342,CANTO VI,
343,CANTO VI,"If thou remember'st well and can'st see clear,"
344,CANTO VI,"Thou wilt perceive thyself like a sick wretch,"
345,CANTO VI,"Who finds no rest upon her down, but oft"
346,CANTO VI,"Shifting her side, short respite seeks from pain."
347,CANTO VI,
348,CANTO VI,
349,CANTO VI,
350,CANTO VI,
351,CANTO VII,CANTO VII
352,CANTO VII,
353,CANTO VII,After their courteous greetings joyfully
354,CANTO VII,"Sev'n times exchang'd, Sordello backward drew"
355,CANTO VII,"Exclaiming, ""Who are ye?""  ""Before this mount"
356,CANTO VII,By spirits worthy of ascent to God
357,CANTO VII,"Was sought, my bones had by Octavius' care"
358,CANTO VII,"Been buried.  I am Virgil, for no sin"
359,CANTO VII,"Depriv'd of heav'n, except for lack of faith."""
360,CANTO VII,
361,CANTO VII,So answer'd him in few my gentle guide.
362,CANTO VII,
363,CANTO VII,"As one, who aught before him suddenly"
364,CANTO VII,"Beholding, whence his wonder riseth, cries"
365,CANTO VII,"""It is yet is not,"" wav'ring in belief;"
366,CANTO VII,"Such he appear'd; then downward bent his eyes,"
367,CANTO VII,"And drawing near with reverential step,"
368,CANTO VII,"Caught him, where of mean estate might clasp"
369,CANTO VII,"His lord.  ""Glory of Latium!"" he exclaim'd,"
370,CANTO VII,"""In whom our tongue its utmost power display'd!"
371,CANTO VII,Boast of my honor'd birth-place! what desert
372,CANTO VII,"Of mine, what favour rather undeserv'd,"
373,CANTO VII,Shows thee to me?  If I to hear that voice
374,CANTO VII,"Am worthy, say if from below thou com'st"
375,CANTO VII,"And from what cloister's pale?""--""Through every orb"
376,CANTO VII,"Of that sad region,"" he reply'd, ""thus far"
377,CANTO VII,"Am I arriv'd, by heav'nly influence led"
378,CANTO VII,And with such aid I come.  There is a place
379,CANTO VII,"There underneath, not made by torments sad,"
380,CANTO VII,But by dun shades alone; where mourning's voice
381,CANTO VII,"Sounds not of anguish sharp, but breathes in sighs."
382,CANTO VII,
383,CANTO VII,"""There I with little innocents abide,"
384,CANTO VII,"Who by death's fangs were bitten, ere exempt"
385,CANTO VII,"From human taint.  There I with those abide,"
386,CANTO VII,"Who the three holy virtues put not on,"
387,CANTO VII,"But understood the rest, and without blame"
388,CANTO VII,"Follow'd them all.  But if thou know'st and canst,"
389,CANTO VII,"Direct us, how we soonest may arrive,"
390,CANTO VII,"Where Purgatory its true beginning takes."""
391,CANTO VII,
392,CANTO VII,"He answer'd thus: ""We have no certain place"
393,CANTO VII,"Assign'd us: upwards I may go or round,"
394,CANTO VII,"Far as I can, I join thee for thy guide."
395,CANTO VII,But thou beholdest now how day declines:
396,CANTO VII,"And upwards to proceed by night, our power"
397,CANTO VII,Excels: therefore it may be well to choose
398,CANTO VII,A place of pleasant sojourn.  To the right
399,CANTO VII,Some spirits sit apart retir'd.  If thou
400,CANTO VII,"Consentest, I to these will lead thy steps:"
401,CANTO VII,"And thou wilt know them, not without delight."""
402,CANTO VII,
403,CANTO VII,"""How chances this?""  was answer'd; ""who so wish'd"
404,CANTO VII,"To ascend by night, would he be thence debarr'd"
405,CANTO VII,"By other, or through his own weakness fail?"""
406,CANTO VII,
407,CANTO VII,"The good Sordello then, along the ground"
408,CANTO VII,"Trailing his finger, spoke: ""Only this line"

410,CANTO VII,Hath disappear'd; not that aught else impedes
411,CANTO VII,"Thy going upwards, save the shades of night."
412,CANTO VII,These with the wont of power perplex the will.
413,CANTO VII,"With them thou haply mightst return beneath,"
414,CANTO VII,Or to and fro around the mountain's side
415,CANTO VII,"Wander, while day is in the horizon shut."""
416,CANTO VII,
417,CANTO VII,"My master straight, as wond'ring at his speech,"
418,CANTO VII,"Exclaim'd: ""Then lead us quickly, where thou sayst,"
419,CANTO VII,"That, while we stay, we may enjoy delight."""
420,CANTO VII,
421,CANTO VII,"A little space we were remov'd from thence,"
422,CANTO VII,When I perceiv'd the mountain hollow'd out.
423,CANTO VII,"Ev'n as large valleys hollow'd out on earth,"
424,CANTO VII,
425,CANTO VII,"""That way,"" the' escorting spirit cried, ""we go,"
426,CANTO VII,Where in a bosom the high bank recedes:
427,CANTO VII,"And thou await renewal of the day."""
428,CANTO VII,
429,CANTO VII,Betwixt the steep and plain a crooked path
430,CANTO VII,"Led us traverse into the ridge's side,"
431,CANTO VII,Where more than half the sloping edge expires.
432,CANTO VII,"Refulgent gold, and silver thrice refin'd,"
433,CANTO VII,"And scarlet grain and ceruse, Indian wood"
434,CANTO VII,"Of lucid dye serene, fresh emeralds"
435,CANTO VII,"But newly broken, by the herbs and flowers"
436,CANTO VII,"Plac'd in that fair recess, in color all"
437,CANTO VII,"Had been surpass'd, as great surpasses less."
438,CANTO VII,"Nor nature only there lavish'd her hues,"
439,CANTO VII,But of the sweetness of a thousand smells
440,CANTO VII,A rare and undistinguish'd fragrance made.
441,CANTO VII,
442,CANTO VII,"""Salve Regina,"" on the grass and flowers"
443,CANTO VII,Here chanting I beheld those spirits sit
444,CANTO VII,Who not beyond the valley could be seen.

446,CANTO VII,"""Before the west'ring sun sink to his bed,"""
447,CANTO VII,"Began the Mantuan, who our steps had turn'd,"

450,CANTO VII,For from this eminence ye shall discern

452,CANTO VII,Than in the nether vale among them mix'd.
453,CANTO VII,"He, who sits high above the rest, and seems"
454,CANTO VII,"To have neglected that he should have done,"
455,CANTO VII,"And to the others' song moves not his lip,"

457,CANTO VII,"The wounds whereof fair Italy hath died,"
458,CANTO VII,"So that by others she revives but slowly,"
459,CANTO VII,"He, who with kindly visage comforts him,"
460,CANTO VII,"Sway'd in that country, where the water springs,"
461,CANTO VII,"That Moldaw's river to the Elbe, and Elbe"
462,CANTO VII,Rolls to the ocean: Ottocar his name:
463,CANTO VII,Who in his swaddling clothes was of more worth
464,CANTO VII,"Than Winceslaus his son, a bearded man,"
465,CANTO VII,Pamper'd with rank luxuriousness and ease.
466,CANTO VII,"And that one with the nose depress, who close"
467,CANTO VII,"In counsel seems with him of gentle look,"
468,CANTO VII,"Flying expir'd, with'ring the lily's flower."
469,CANTO VII,Look there how he doth knock against his breast!
470,CANTO VII,"The other ye behold, who for his cheek"
471,CANTO VII,"Makes of one hand a couch, with frequent sighs."
472,CANTO VII,They are the father and the father-in-law
473,CANTO VII,Of Gallia's bane: his vicious life they know
474,CANTO VII,And foul; thence comes the grief that rends them thus.

476,CANTO VII,"""He, so robust of limb, who measure keeps"

480,CANTO VII,"King after him had liv'd, his virtue then"
481,CANTO VII,From vessel to like vessel had been pour'd;

487,CANTO VII,"He who bestows it, that as his free gift"
488,CANTO VII,It may be call'd.  To Charles my words apply
489,CANTO VII,No less than to his brother in the song;
490,CANTO VII,Which Pouille and Provence now with grief confess.
491,CANTO VII,"So much that plant degenerates from its seed,"

511,CANTO VIII,"In men at sea, and melts their thoughtful heart,"
512,CANTO VIII,"Who in the morn have bid sweet friends farewell,"
513,CANTO VIII,And pilgrim newly on his road with love
514,CANTO VIII,"Thrills, if he hear the vesper bell from far,"
515,CANTO VIII,That seems to mourn for the expiring day:
516,CANTO VIII,"When I, no longer taking heed to hear"
517,CANTO VIII,"Began, with wonder, from those spirits to mark"
518,CANTO VIII,"One risen from its seat, which with its hand"
519,CANTO VIII,"Audience implor'd. Both palms it join'd and rais'd,"
520,CANTO VIII,"Fixing its steadfast gaze towards the east,"

524,CANTO VIII,"Came from its lip, and in so soft a strain,"
525,CANTO VIII,That all my sense in ravishment was lost.
526,CANTO VIII,"And the rest after, softly and devout,"
527,CANTO VIII,"Follow'd through all the hymn, with upward gaze"
528,CANTO VIII,Directed to the bright supernal wheels.
529,CANTO VIII,
530,CANTO VIII,"Here, reader! for the truth makes thine eyes keen:"
531,CANTO VIII,"For of so subtle texture is this veil,"
532,CANTO VIII,That thou with ease mayst pass it through unmark'd.
533,CANTO VIII,
534,CANTO VIII,I saw that gentle band silently next
535,CANTO VIII,"Look up, as if in expectation held,"
536,CANTO VIII,Pale and in lowly guise; and from on high
537,CANTO VIII,I saw forth issuing descend beneath
538,CANTO VIII,"Two angels with two flame-illumin'd swords,"
539,CANTO VIII,Broken and mutilated at their points.
540,CANTO VIII,"Green as the tender leaves but newly born,"
541,CANTO VIII,"Their vesture was, the which by wings as green"
542,CANTO VIII,"Beaten, they drew behind them, fann'd in air."
543,CANTO VIII,"A little over us one took his stand,"
544,CANTO VIII,"The other lighted on the' Opposing hill,"
545,CANTO VIII,So that the troop were in the midst contain'd.
546,CANTO VIII,
547,CANTO VIII,Well I descried the whiteness on their heads;
548,CANTO VIII,But in their visages the dazzled eye
549,CANTO VIII,"Was lost, as faculty that by too much"
550,CANTO VIII,"Is overpower'd.  ""From Mary's bosom both"
551,CANTO VIII,"Are come,"" exclaim'd Sordello, ""as a guard"
552,CANTO VIII,"Over the vale, ganst him, who hither tends,"
553,CANTO VIII,"The serpent.""  Whence, not knowing by which path"
554,CANTO VIII,"He came, I turn'd me round, and closely press'd,"
555,CANTO VIII,"All frozen, to my leader's trusted side."
556,CANTO VIII,
557,CANTO VIII,"Sordello paus'd not: ""To the valley now"

561,CANTO VIII,"Methinks I measur'd, ere I was beneath,"
562,CANTO VIII,And noted one who look'd as with desire
563,CANTO VIII,To know me.  Time was now that air arrow dim;
564,CANTO VIII,"Yet not so dim, that 'twixt his eyes and mine"
565,CANTO VIII,It clear'd not up what was conceal'd before.
566,CANTO VIII,Mutually tow'rds each other we advanc'd.

578,CANTO VIII,"As suddenly amaz'd.  To Virgil one,"
579,CANTO VIII,"The other to a spirit turn'd, who near"
580,CANTO VIII,"Was seated, crying: ""Conrad! up with speed:"
581,CANTO VIII,"Come, see what of his grace high God hath will'd."""
582,CANTO VIII,"Then turning round to me: ""By that rare mark"
583,CANTO VIII,"Of honour which thou ow'st to him, who hides"
584,CANTO VIII,"So deeply his first cause, it hath no ford,"
585,CANTO VIII,When thou shalt be beyond the vast of waves.

591,CANTO VIII,"By her it easily may be perceiv'd,"
592,CANTO VIII,"How long in women lasts the flame of love,"
593,CANTO VIII,If sight and touch do not relume it oft.

597,CANTO VIII,
598,CANTO VIII,"He spoke, and in his visage took the stamp"
599,CANTO VIII,"Of that right seal, which with due temperature"
600,CANTO VIII,Glows in the bosom.  My insatiate eyes
601,CANTO VIII,"Meanwhile to heav'n had travel'd, even there"
602,CANTO VIII,"Where the bright stars are slowest, as a wheel"
603,CANTO VIII,Nearest the axle; when my guide inquir'd:
604,CANTO VIII,"""What there aloft, my son, has caught thy gaze?"""
605,CANTO VIII,
606,CANTO VIII,"I answer'd: ""The three torches, with which here"
607,CANTO VIII,"The pole is all on fire.""  He then to me:"

611,CANTO VIII,While yet he spoke.  Sordello to himself
612,CANTO VIII,"Drew him, and cry'd: ""Lo there our enemy!"""
613,CANTO VIII,And with his hand pointed that way to look.
614,CANTO VIII,
615,CANTO VIII,"Along the side, where barrier none arose"
616,CANTO VIII,"Around the little vale, a serpent lay,"
617,CANTO VIII,Such haply as gave Eve the bitter food.
618,CANTO VIII,"Between the grass and flowers, the evil snake"
619,CANTO VIII,"Came on, reverting oft his lifted head;"
620,CANTO VIII,"And, as a beast that smoothes its polish'd coat,"
621,CANTO VIII,"Licking his hack.  I saw not, nor can tell,"
622,CANTO VIII,How those celestial falcons from their seat
623,CANTO VIII,"Mov'd, but in motion each one well descried,"
624,CANTO VIII,Hearing the air cut by their verdant plumes.
625,CANTO VIII,The serpent fled; and to their stations back
626,CANTO VIII,The angels up return'd with equal flight.
627,CANTO VIII,
628,CANTO VIII,"The Spirit (who to Nino, when he call'd,"

671,CANTO IX,"Of that chill animal, who with his train"
672,CANTO IX,"Smites fearful nations: and where then we were,"

674,CANTO IX,"And now the third was closing up its wing,"
675,CANTO IX,"When I, who had so much of Adam with me,"
676,CANTO IX,"Sank down upon the grass, o'ercome with sleep,"

684,CANTO IX,"A golden-feather'd eagle in the sky,"
685,CANTO IX,"With open wings, and hov'ring for descent,"
686,CANTO IX,"And I was in that place, methought, from whence"

696,CANTO IX,"There both, I thought, the eagle and myself"

739,CANTO IX,"As more and more mine eye did stretch its view,"

797,CANTO IX,"Then of that hallow'd gate he thrust the door,"
798,CANTO IX,"Exclaiming, ""Enter, but this warning hear:"
799,CANTO IX,"He forth again departs who looks behind."""
800,CANTO IX,
801,CANTO IX,As in the hinges of that sacred ward
802,CANTO IX,"The swivels turn'd, sonorous metal strong,"
803,CANTO IX,Harsh was the grating; nor so surlily
804,CANTO IX,"Roar'd the Tarpeian, when by force bereft"
805,CANTO IX,"Of good Metellus, thenceforth from his loss"
806,CANTO IX,"To leanness doom'd.  Attentively I turn'd,"
807,CANTO IX,"List'ning the thunder, that first issued forth;"
808,CANTO IX,"And ""We praise thee, O God,"" methought I heard"
809,CANTO IX,In accents blended with sweet melody.
810,CANTO IX,"The strains came o'er mine ear, e'en as the sound"
811,CANTO IX,"Of choral voices, that in solemn chant"
812,CANTO IX,"With organ mingle, and, now high and clear,"
813,CANTO IX,"Come swelling, now float indistinct away."
814,CANTO IX,
815,CANTO IX,
816,CANTO IX,
817,CANTO IX,
818,CANTO X,CANTO X
819,CANTO X,
820,CANTO X,When we had passed the threshold of the gate
821,CANTO X,"(Which the soul's ill affection doth disuse,"
822,CANTO X,"Making the crooked seem the straighter path),"
823,CANTO X,"I heard its closing sound.  Had mine eyes turn'd,"
824,CANTO X,For that offence what plea might have avail'd?
825,CANTO X,
826,CANTO X,"We mounted up the riven rock, that wound"
827,CANTO X,"On either side alternate, as the wave"
828,CANTO X,"Flies and advances.  ""Here some little art"
829,CANTO X,"Behooves us,"" said my leader, ""that our steps"
830,CANTO X,"Observe the varying flexure of the path."""
831,CANTO X,
832,CANTO X,"Thus we so slowly sped, that with cleft orb"
833,CANTO X,"The moon once more o'erhangs her wat'ry couch,"
834,CANTO X,Ere we that strait have threaded.  But when free
835,CANTO X,"We came and open, where the mount above"
836,CANTO X,"One solid mass retires, I spent, with toil,"
837,CANTO X,"And both, uncertain of the way, we stood,"
838,CANTO X,"Upon a plain more lonesome, than the roads"
839,CANTO X,That traverse desert wilds.  From whence the brink
840,CANTO X,"Borders upon vacuity, to foot"
841,CANTO X,"Of the steep bank, that rises still, the space"
842,CANTO X,Had measur'd thrice the stature of a man:
843,CANTO X,"And, distant as mine eye could wing its flight,"
844,CANTO X,"To leftward now and now to right dispatch'd,"
845,CANTO X,That cornice equal in extent appear'd.
846,CANTO X,
847,CANTO X,"Not yet our feet had on that summit mov'd,"
848,CANTO X,"When I discover'd that the bank around,"
849,CANTO X,"Whose proud uprising all ascent denied,"
850,CANTO X,"Was marble white, and so exactly wrought"
851,CANTO X,"With quaintest sculpture, that not there alone"
852,CANTO X,"Had Polycletus, but e'en nature's self"
853,CANTO X,Been sham'd.  The angel who came down to earth
854,CANTO X,With tidings of the peace so many years
855,CANTO X,"Wept for in vain, that op'd the heavenly gates"
856,CANTO X,"From their long interdict, before us seem'd,"
857,CANTO X,"In a sweet act, so sculptur'd to the life,"
858,CANTO X,He look'd no silent image. One had sworn
859,CANTO X,"He had said, ""Hail!"" for she was imag'd there,"
860,CANTO X,"By whom the key did open to God's love,"
861,CANTO X,And in her act as sensibly impress
862,CANTO X,"That word, ""Behold the handmaid of the Lord,"""
863,CANTO X,"As figure seal'd on wax.  ""Fix not thy mind"
864,CANTO X,"On one place only,"" said the guide belov'd,"
865,CANTO X,Who had me near him on that part where lies
866,CANTO X,The heart of man.  My sight forthwith I turn'd
867,CANTO X,"And mark'd, behind the virgin mother's form,"
868,CANTO X,"Upon that side, where he, that mov'd me, stood,"
869,CANTO X,Another story graven on the rock.
870,CANTO X,
871,CANTO X,"I passed athwart the bard, and drew me near,"
872,CANTO X,That it might stand more aptly for my view.
873,CANTO X,There in the self-same marble were engrav'd
874,CANTO X,"The cart and kine, drawing the sacred ark,"
875,CANTO X,That from unbidden office awes mankind.
876,CANTO X,Before it came much people; and the whole
877,CANTO X,"Parted in seven quires.  One sense cried, ""Nay,"""
878,CANTO X,"Another, ""Yes, they sing.""  Like doubt arose"
879,CANTO X,"Betwixt the eye and smell, from the curl'd fume"
880,CANTO X,Of incense breathing up the well-wrought toil.
881,CANTO X,"Preceding the blest vessel, onward came"
882,CANTO X,"With light dance leaping, girt in humble guise,"
883,CANTO X,Sweet Israel's harper: in that hap he seem'd
884,CANTO X,"Less and yet more than kingly.  Opposite,"
885,CANTO X,"At a great palace, from the lattice forth"
886,CANTO X,"Look'd Michol, like a lady full of scorn"
887,CANTO X,"And sorrow.  To behold the tablet next,"
888,CANTO X,"Which at the hack of Michol whitely shone,"
889,CANTO X,I mov'd me.  There was storied on the rock
890,CANTO X,"The' exalted glory of the Roman prince,"
891,CANTO X,Whose mighty worth mov'd Gregory to earn
892,CANTO X,"His mighty conquest, Trajan th' Emperor."
893,CANTO X,"A widow at his bridle stood, attir'd"
894,CANTO X,In tears and mourning.  Round about them troop'd
895,CANTO X,"Full throng of knights, and overhead in gold"
896,CANTO X,"The eagles floated, struggling with the wind."
897,CANTO X,
898,CANTO X,The wretch appear'd amid all these to say:
899,CANTO X,"""Grant vengeance, sire! for, woe beshrew this heart"
900,CANTO X,"My son is murder'd.""  He replying seem'd;"
901,CANTO X,
902,CANTO X,"""Wait now till I return."" And she, as one"
903,CANTO X,"Made hasty by her grief; ""O sire, if thou"
904,CANTO X,"Dost not return?""--""Where I am, who then is,"
905,CANTO X,"May right thee.""--""What to thee is other's good,"
906,CANTO X,"If thou neglect thy own?""--""Now comfort thee,"""
907,CANTO X,"At length he answers.  ""It beseemeth well"
908,CANTO X,"My duty be perform'd, ere I move hence:"
909,CANTO X,"So justice wills; and pity bids me stay."""
910,CANTO X,
911,CANTO X,"He, whose ken nothing new surveys, produc'd"
912,CANTO X,"That visible speaking, new to us and strange"
913,CANTO X,The like not found on earth.  Fondly I gaz'd
914,CANTO X,"Upon those patterns of meek humbleness,"
915,CANTO X,"Shapes yet more precious for their artist's sake,"
916,CANTO X,"When ""Lo,"" the poet whisper'd, ""where this way"
917,CANTO X,"(But slack their pace), a multitude advance."
918,CANTO X,"These to the lofty steps shall guide us on."""
919,CANTO X,
920,CANTO X,"Mine eyes, though bent on view of novel sights"
921,CANTO X,"Their lov'd allurement, were not slow to turn."
922,CANTO X,
923,CANTO X,Reader! would not that amaz'd thou miss
924,CANTO X,"Of thy good purpose, hearing how just God"
925,CANTO X,Decrees our debts be cancel'd.  Ponder not
926,CANTO X,"The form of suff'ring.  Think on what succeeds,"
927,CANTO X,Think that at worst beyond the mighty doom
928,CANTO X,"It cannot pass.  ""Instructor,"" I began,"
929,CANTO X,"""What I see hither tending, bears no trace"
930,CANTO X,"Of human semblance, nor of aught beside"
931,CANTO X,"That my foil'd sight can guess.""  He answering thus:"
932,CANTO X,"""So courb'd to earth, beneath their heavy teems"
933,CANTO X,"Of torment stoop they, that mine eye at first"
934,CANTO X,"Struggled as thine.  But look intently thither,"
935,CANTO X,"An disentangle with thy lab'ring view,"
936,CANTO X,"What underneath those stones approacheth: now,"
937,CANTO X,"E'en now, mayst thou discern the pangs of each."""
938,CANTO X,
939,CANTO X,Christians and proud! poor and wretched ones!
940,CANTO X,"That feeble in the mind's eye, lean your trust"
941,CANTO X,Upon unstaid perverseness! now ye not
942,CANTO X,"That we are worms, yet made at last to form"
943,CANTO X,"The winged insect, imp'd with angel plumes"
944,CANTO X,That to heaven's justice unobstructed soars?
945,CANTO X,Why buoy ye up aloft your unfleg'd souls?
946,CANTO X,"Abortive then and shapeless ye remain,"
947,CANTO X,Like the untimely embryon of a worm!
948,CANTO X,
949,CANTO X,"As, to support incumbent floor or roof,"
950,CANTO X,"For corbel is a figure sometimes seen,"
951,CANTO X,"That crumples up its knees unto its breast,"
952,CANTO X,With the feign'd posture stirring ruth unfeign'd
953,CANTO X,In the beholder's fancy; so I saw
954,CANTO X,"These fashion'd, when I noted well their guise."
955,CANTO X,
956,CANTO X,"Each, as his back was laden, came indeed"
957,CANTO X,Or more or less contract; but it appear'd
958,CANTO X,"As he, who show'd most patience in his look,"
959,CANTO X,"Wailing exclaim'd: ""I can endure no more."""
