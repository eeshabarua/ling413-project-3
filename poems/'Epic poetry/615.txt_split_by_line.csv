41,INTRODUCTION:,INTRODUCTION:
42,INTRODUCTION:,
43,INTRODUCTION:,"This work is a continuation of the ""Orlando Innamorato"" of Matteo"
44,INTRODUCTION:,"Maria Boiardo, which was left unfinished upon the author's death"
45,INTRODUCTION:,in 1494.  It begins more or less at the point where Boiardo left
46,INTRODUCTION:,it.
47,INTRODUCTION:,
48,INTRODUCTION:,"This is a brief synopsis of Boiardo's work, omitting most of the"
49,INTRODUCTION:,numerous digressions and incidental episodes associated with
50,INTRODUCTION:,these events:
51,INTRODUCTION:,
52,INTRODUCTION:,To the court of King Charlemagne comes Angelica (daughter to the
53,INTRODUCTION:,"king of Cathay, or India) and her brother Argalia.  Angelica is"
54,INTRODUCTION:,"the most beautiful woman any of the Peers have ever seen, and all"
55,INTRODUCTION:,"want her.  However, in order to take her as wife they must first"
56,INTRODUCTION:,defeat Argalia in combat.  The two most stricken by her are
57,INTRODUCTION:,"Orlando and Ranaldo (""Rinaldo"" in Rose)."
58,INTRODUCTION:,
59,INTRODUCTION:,"When Argalia falls to the heathen knight Ferrau, Angelica flees"
60,INTRODUCTION:,"-- with Orlando and Ranaldo in hot pursuit.  Along the way, both"
61,INTRODUCTION:,Angelica and Ranaldo drink magic waters -- Angelica is filled
62,INTRODUCTION:,"with a burning love for Ranaldo, but Ranaldo is now indifferent."
63,INTRODUCTION:,
64,INTRODUCTION:,"Eventually, Orlando and Ranaldo arrive at Angelica's castle."
65,INTRODUCTION:,"Others also gather at Angelica's castle, including Agricane, King"
66,INTRODUCTION:,"of Tartary; Sacripant, King of Circassia; Agramante, King of"
67,INTRODUCTION:,"Africa and Marfisa (""Marphisa"" in Rose), an Asian warrior-Queen."
68,INTRODUCTION:,"Except for Orlando and Ranaldo, all are heathen."
69,INTRODUCTION:,
70,INTRODUCTION:,"Meanwhile, France is threatened by heathen invaders.  Led by King"
71,INTRODUCTION:,Gradasso of Sericana (whose principal reason for going to war is
72,INTRODUCTION:,"to obtain Orlando's sword, Durindana) and King Rodomonte of"
73,INTRODUCTION:,"Sarzia, a Holy War between Pagans and Christians ensues."
74,INTRODUCTION:,
75,INTRODUCTION:,"Ranaldo leaves Angelica's castle, and Angelica and a very"
76,INTRODUCTION:,"love-sick (but very chaste and proper) Orlando, set out for"
77,INTRODUCTION:,France in search of him.  Again the same waters as before are
78,INTRODUCTION:,"drunk from, but this time in reverse -- Ranaldo now burns for"
79,INTRODUCTION:,"Angelica, but Angelica is now indifferent.  Ranaldo and Orlando"
80,INTRODUCTION:,"now begin to fight over her, but King Charlemagne (fearing the"
81,INTRODUCTION:,consequences if his two best knights kill each other in combat)
82,INTRODUCTION:,intervenes and promises Angelica to whichever of the two fights
83,INTRODUCTION:,the best against the heathen; he leaves her in the care of Duke
84,INTRODUCTION:,Namus.  Orlando and Ranaldo arrive in Paris just in time to
85,INTRODUCTION:,repulse an attack by Agramante.
86,INTRODUCTION:,
87,INTRODUCTION:,"Namus' camp is overrun by the heathen.  Angelica escapes, with"
88,INTRODUCTION:,"Ranaldo in pursuit.  Also in pursuit is Ferrau, who (because he"
89,INTRODUCTION:,had defeated Argalia) considers Angelica his.  It is at this
90,INTRODUCTION:,point that the poem breaks off.
91,INTRODUCTION:,
92,INTRODUCTION:,"While the Orlando-Ranaldo-Angelica triangle is going on, the"
93,INTRODUCTION:,stories of other knights and their loves are mixed in.  Most
94,INTRODUCTION:,important of these is that of the female knight Bradamante
95,INTRODUCTION:,"(sister of Ranaldo), who falls in love with a very noble heathen"
96,INTRODUCTION:,"knight named Ruggiero (""Rogero"" in Rose).  Ruggiero, who is said"
97,INTRODUCTION:,"to be a descendent of Alexander the Great and Hector, also falls"
98,INTRODUCTION:,"in love with Bradamante, but because they are fighting on"
99,INTRODUCTION:,opposite sides it is felt that their love is hopeless.
100,INTRODUCTION:,"Nevertheless, it is prophecised that they shall wed and found the"
101,INTRODUCTION:,"famous Este line, who shall rise to become one of the major"
102,INTRODUCTION:,families of Medieval and Renaissance Italy (it is worth noting
103,INTRODUCTION:,that the Estes where the patrons of both Boiardo and Ariosto).
104,INTRODUCTION:,"Opposed to this prophecy is Atlantes, an African wizard who seeks"
105,INTRODUCTION:,to derail fate and keep Ruggiero from becoming a Christian.  By
106,INTRODUCTION:,"the end of the poem, Ruggiero is imprisoned in Atlantes' castle."
107,INTRODUCTION:,"However, Bradamante (who has decided to follow her heart) is in"
108,INTRODUCTION:,"pursuit of her love, and is not too far away.  It is the"
109,INTRODUCTION:,Bradamante-Ruggiero story that eventually takes center stage in
110,INTRODUCTION:,Ariosto's work.
111,INTRODUCTION:,
112,INTRODUCTION:,"Other characters of importance: Astolfo, a Peer and friend of"
113,INTRODUCTION:,"Orlando, who is kidnaped by the evil witch Morgana and her sister"
114,INTRODUCTION:,"Alcina; Mandricardo, a fierce but hot-headed heathen; and a young"
115,INTRODUCTION:,"knight named Brandimarte, who falls in love with (and wins the"
116,INTRODUCTION:,"heart of) the beautiful Fiordelisa (""Flordelice"" in Rose).  All"
117,INTRODUCTION:,play major or semi-major roles in the events of Ariosto's poem.

136,I,I
137,I,"OF LOVES and LADIES, KNIGHTS and ARMS, I sing,"
138,I,"Of COURTESIES, and many a DARING FEAT;"
139,I,"And from those ancient days my story bring,"
140,I,"When Moors from Afric passed in hostile fleet,"
141,I,"And ravaged France, with Agramant their king,"
142,I,"Flushed with his youthful rage and furious heat,"
143,I,"Who on king Charles', the Roman emperor's head"
144,I,Had vowed due vengeance for Troyano dead.
145,I,
146,II,II
147,II,In the same strain of Roland will I tell
148,II,"Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme,"
149,II,"On whom strange madness and rank fury fell,"
150,II,A man esteemed so wise in former time;
151,II,"If she, who to like cruel pass has well"
152,II,Nigh brought my feeble wit which fain would climb
153,II,"And hourly wastes my sense, concede me skill"
154,II,And strength my daring promise to fulfil.
155,II,
156,III,III
157,III,"Good seed of Hercules, give ear and deign,"
158,III,"Thou that this age's grace and splendour art,"
159,III,"Hippolitus, to smile upon his pain"
160,III,Who tenders what he has with humble heart.
161,III,"For though all hope to quit the score were vain,"
162,III,My pen and pages may pay the debt in part;
163,III,"Then, with no jealous eye my offering scan,"
164,III,Nor scorn my gifts who give thee all I can.
165,III,
166,IV,IV
167,IV,"And me, amid the worthiest shalt thou hear,"
168,IV,"Whom I with fitting praise prepare to grace,"
169,IV,"Record the good Rogero, valiant peer,"
170,IV,The ancient root of thine illustrious race.
171,IV,"Of him, if thou wilt lend a willing ear,"
172,IV,The worth and warlike feats I shall retrace;
173,IV,So thou thy graver cares some little time
174,IV,"Postponing, lend thy leisure to my rhyme."
175,IV,
176,V,V
177,V,"Roland, who long the lady of Catay,"
178,V,"Angelica, had loved, and with his brand"
179,V,"Raised countless trophies to that damsel gay,"
180,V,"In India, Median, and Tartarian land,"
181,V,Westward with her had measured back his way;
182,V,"Where, nigh the Pyrenees, with many a band"
183,V,"Of Germany and France, King Charlemagne"
184,V,Had camped his faithful host upon the plain.
185,V,
186,VI,VI
187,VI,"To make King Agramant, for penance, smite"
188,VI,"His cheek, and rash Marsilius rue the hour;"
189,VI,"This, when all trained with lance and sword to fight,"
190,VI,He led from Africa to swell his power;
191,VI,"That other when he pushed, in fell despite,"
192,VI,Against the realm of France Spain's martial flower.
193,VI,'Twas thus Orlando came where Charles was tented
194,VI,"In evil hour, and soon the deed repented."
195,VI,
196,VII,VII
197,VII,"For here was seized his dame of peerless charms,"
198,VII,(How often human judgment wanders wide)!
199,VII,"Whom in long warfare he had kept from harms,"
200,VII,From western climes to eastern shores her guide
201,VII,"In his own land, 'mid friends and kindred arms,"
202,VII,Now without contest severed from his side.
203,VII,"Fearing the mischief kindled by her eyes,"
204,VII,From him the prudent emperor reft the prize.
205,VII,
206,VIII,VIII
207,VIII,"For bold Orlando and his cousin, free"
208,VIII,"Rinaldo, late contended for the maid,"
209,VIII,Enamored of that beauty rare; since she
210,VIII,Alike the glowing breast of either swayed.
211,VIII,"But Charles, who little liked such rivalry,"
212,VIII,"And drew an omen thence of feebler aid,"
213,VIII,"To abate the cause of quarrel, seized the fair,"
214,VIII,And placed her in Bavarian Namus' care.
215,VIII,
216,IX,IX
217,IX,"Vowing with her the warrior to content,"
218,IX,"Who in that conflict, on that fatal day,"
219,IX,"With his good hand most gainful succour lent,"
220,IX,And slew most paynims in the martial fray.
221,IX,"But counter to his hopes the battle went,"
222,IX,And his thinned squadrons fled in disarray;
223,IX,"Namus, with other Christian captains taken,"
224,IX,And his pavilion in the rout forsaken.
225,IX,
226,X,X
227,X,"There, lodged by Charles, that gentle bonnibel,"
228,X,"Ordained to be the valiant victor's meed,"
229,X,"Before the event had sprung into her sell,"
230,X,And from the combat turned in time of need;
231,X,Presaging wisely Fortune would rebel
232,X,That fatal day against the Christian creed:
233,X,"And, entering a thick wood, discovered near,"
234,X,"In a close path, a horseless cavalier."
235,X,
236,XI,XI
237,XI,"With shield upon his arm, in knightly wise,"
238,XI,"Belted and mailed, his helmet on his head;"
239,XI,The knight more lightly through the forest hies
240,XI,Than half-clothed churl to win the cloth of red.
241,XI,But not from cruel snake more swiftly flies
242,XI,"The timid shepherdess, with startled tread,"
243,XI,Than poor Angelica the bridle turns
244,XI,When she the approaching knight on foot discerns.
245,XI,
246,XII,XII
247,XII,"This was that Paladin, good Aymon's seed,"
248,XII,Who Mount Albano had in his command;
249,XII,"And late Baiardo lost, his gallant steed,"
250,XII,Escaped by strange adventure from his hand.
251,XII,"As soon as seen, the maid who rode at speed"
252,XII,"The warrior knew, and, while yet distant, scanned"
253,XII,The angelic features and the gentle air
254,XII,Which long had held him fast in Cupid's snare.
255,XII,
256,XIII,XIII
257,XIII,"The affrighted damsel turns her palfrey round,"
258,XIII,And shakes the floating bridle in the wind;
259,XIII,"Nor in her panic seeks to choose her ground,"
260,XIII,Nor open grove prefers to thicket blind.
261,XIII,"But reckless, pale and trembling, and astound,"
262,XIII,Leaves to her horse the devious way to find.
263,XIII,"He up and down the forest bore the dame,"
264,XIII,Till to a sylvan river's bank he came.
265,XIII,
266,XIV,XIV
267,XIV,"Here stood the fierce Ferrau in grisly plight,"
268,XIV,"Begrimed with dust, and bathed with sweat and blood"
269,XIV,"Who lately had withdrawn him from the fight,"
270,XIV,To rest and drink at that refreshing flood:
271,XIV,"But there had tarried in his own despite,"
272,XIV,"Since bending from the bank, in hasty mood,"
273,XIV,"He dropped his helmet in the crystal tide,"
274,XIV,And vainly to regain the treasure tried.
275,XIV,
276,XV,XV
277,XV,"Thither at speed she drives, and evermore"
278,XV,In her wild panic utters fearful cries;
279,XV,"And at the voice, upleaping on the shore,"
280,XV,The Saracen her lovely visage spies.
281,XV,"And, pale as is her cheek, and troubled sore,"
282,XV,"Arriving, quickly to the warrior's eyes"
283,XV,(Though many days no news of her had shown)
284,XV,The beautiful Angelica is known.
285,XV,
286,XVI,XVI
287,XVI,"Courteous, and haply gifted with a breast"
288,XVI,As warm as either of the cousins two;
289,XVI,"As bold, as if his brows in steel were dressed,"
290,XVI,"The succour which she sought he lent, and drew"
291,XVI,"His faulchion, and against Rinaldo pressed,"
292,XVI,Who saw with little fear the champion true.
293,XVI,"Not only each to each was known by sight,"
294,XVI,But each had proved in arms his foeman's might.
295,XVI,
296,XVII,XVII
297,XVII,"Thus, as they are, on foot the warriors vie"
298,XVII,"In cruel strife, and blade to blade oppose;"
299,XVII,"No marvel plate or brittle mail should fly,"
300,XVII,When anvils had not stood the deafening blows.
301,XVII,It now behoves the palfrey swift to ply
302,XVII,"His feet; for while the knights in combat close,"
303,XVII,"Him vexed to utmost speed, with goading spurs,"
304,XVII,By waste or wood the frighted damsel stirs.
305,XVII,
306,XVIII,XVIII
307,XVIII,After the two had struggled long to throw
308,XVIII,"Each other in the strife, and vainly still;"
309,XVIII,Since neither valiant warrior was below
310,XVIII,His opposite in force and knightly skill:
311,XVIII,The first to parley with his Spanish foe
312,XVIII,Was the good master of Albano's hill
313,XVIII,(As one within whose raging breast was pent
314,XVIII,A reckless fire which struggled for a vent).
315,XVIII,
316,XIX,XIX
317,XIX,"""Thou think'st,"" he said, ""to injure me alone,"
318,XIX,But know thou wilt thyself as much molest:
319,XIX,For if we fight because yon rising sun
320,XIX,This raging heat has kindled in thy breast.
321,XIX,"What were thy gain, and what the guerdon won,"
322,XIX,"Though I should yield my life, or stoop my crest;"
323,XIX,"If she shall never be thy glorious meed,"
324,XIX,"Who flies, while vainly we in battle bleed?"
325,XIX,
326,XX,XX
327,XX,"""Then how much better, since our stake's the same,"
328,XX,"Thou, loving like myself, should'st mount and stay"
329,XX,"To wait this battle's end, the lovely dame,"
330,XX,Before she fly yet further on her way.
331,XX,"The lady taken, we repeat our claim"
332,XX,With naked faulchion to that peerless prey:
333,XX,Else by long toil I see not what we gain
334,XX,"But simple loss and unrequited pain."""
335,XX,
336,XXI,XXI
337,XXI,The peer's proposal pleased the paynim well.
338,XXI,And so their hot contention was foregone;
339,XXI,"And such fair truce replaced that discord fell,"
340,XXI,So mutual wrongs forgot and mischief done;
341,XXI,"That for departure seated in his sell,"
342,XXI,On foot the Spaniard left not Aymon's son;
343,XXI,But him to mount his courser's crupper prayed;
344,XXI,And both united chased the royal maid.
345,XXI,
346,XXII,XXII
347,XXII,Oh! goodly truth in cavaliers of old!
348,XXII,"Rivals they were, to different faith were bred."
349,XXII,Not yet the weary warriors' wounds were cold --
350,XXII,Still smarting from those strokes so fell and dread.
351,XXII,"Yet they together ride by waste and wold,"
352,XXII,"And, unsuspecting, devious dingle thread."
353,XXII,"Them, while four spurs infest his foaming sides,"
354,XXII,Their courser brings to where the way divides.
355,XXII,
356,XXIII,XXIII
357,XXIII,"And now the warlike pair at fault, for they"
358,XXIII,"Knew not by which she might her palfrey goad,"
359,XXIII,"(Since both, without distinction, there survey"
360,XXIII,"The recent print of hoofs on either road),"
361,XXIII,Commit the chase to fortune.  By this way
362,XXIII,"The paynim pricked, by that Rinaldo strode."
363,XXIII,"But fierce Ferrau, bewildered in the wood,"
364,XXIII,Found himself once again where late he stood.
365,XXIII,
366,XXIV,XXIV
367,XXIV,"Beside the water, where he stoop'd to drink,"
368,XXIV,"And dropt the knightly helmet, -- to his cost,"
369,XXIV,Sunk in the stream; and since he could not think
370,XXIV,"Her to retrieve, who late his hopes had crossed."
371,XXIV,"He, where the treasure fell, descends the brink"
372,XXIV,"Of that swift stream, and seeks the morion lost."
373,XXIV,"But the casque lies so bedded in the sands,"
374,XXIV,'Twill ask no light endeavour at his hands.
375,XXIV,
376,XXV,XXV
377,XXV,"A bough he severs from a neighbouring tree,"
378,XXV,And shreds and shapes the branch into a pole:
379,XXV,"With this he sounds the stream, and anxiously"
380,XXV,"Fathoms, and rakes, and ransacks shelf and hole."
381,XXV,"While angered sore at heart, and restless, he"
382,XXV,"So lingered, where the troubled waters roll,"
383,XXV,"Breast-high, from the mid river rose upright,"
384,XXV,The apparition of an angry knight.
385,XXV,
386,XXVI,XXVI
387,XXVI,"Armed at all points he was, except his head,"
388,XXVI,And in his better hand a helmet bore:
389,XXVI,"The very casque, which in the river's bed"
390,XXVI,"Ferrau sought vainly, toiling long and sore."
391,XXVI,"Upon the Spanish knight he frowned, and said:"
392,XXVI,"""Thou traitor to thy word, thou perjured Moor,"
393,XXVI,"Why grieve the goodly helmet to resign,"
394,XXVI,"Which, due to me long since, is justly mine?"
395,XXVI,
396,XXVII,XXVII
397,XXVII,"""Remember, pagan, when thine arm laid low"
398,XXVII,The brother of Angelica.  That knight
399,XXVII,Am I; -- thy word was plighted then to throw
400,XXVII,After my other arms his helmet bright.
401,XXVII,If Fortune now compel thee to forego
402,XXVII,"The prize, and do my will in thy despite,"
403,XXVII,"Grieve not at this, but rather grieve that thou"
404,XXVII,Art found a perjured traitor to thy vow.
405,XXVII,
406,XXVIII,XXVIII
407,XXVIII,"""But if thou seek'st a helmet, be thy task"
408,XXVIII,To win and wear it more to thy renown.
409,XXVIII,A noble prize were good Orlando's casque;
410,XXVIII,"Rinaldo's such, or yet a fairer crown;"
411,XXVIII,"Almontes', or Mambrino's iron masque:"
412,XXVIII,"Make one of these, by force of arms, thine own."
413,XXVIII,And this good helm will fitly be bestowed
414,XXVIII,"Where (such thy promise) it has long been owed."""
415,XXVIII,
416,XXIX,XXIX
417,XXIX,Bristled the paynim's every hair at view
418,XXIX,"Of that grim shade, uprising from the tide,"
419,XXIX,"And vanished was his fresh and healthful hue,"
420,XXIX,While on his lips the half-formed accents died.
421,XXIX,"Next hearing Argalia, whom he slew,"
422,XXIX,"(So was the warrior hight) that stream beside,"
423,XXIX,"Thus his unknightly breach of promise blame,"
424,XXIX,"He burned all over, flushed with rage and shame."
425,XXIX,
426,XXX,XXX
427,XXX,"Nor having time his falsehood to excuse,"
428,XXX,"And knowing well how true the phantom's lore,"
429,XXX,Stood speechless; such remorse the words infuse.
430,XXX,"Then by Lanfusa's life the warrior swore,"
431,XXX,"Never in fight, or foray would he use"
432,XXX,Helmet but that which good Orlando bore
433,XXX,"From Aspramont, where bold Almontes paid"
434,XXX,His life a forfeit to the Christian blade.
435,XXX,
436,XXXI,XXXI
437,XXXI,And this new vow discharged more faithfully
438,XXXI,Than the vain promise which was whilom plight;
439,XXXI,"And from the stream departing heavily,"
440,XXXI,Was many days sore vexed and grieved in sprite;
441,XXXI,"And still intent to seek Orlando, he"
442,XXXI,Roved wheresoe'er he hoped to find the knight.
443,XXXI,A different lot befel Rinaldo; who
444,XXXI,Had chanced another pathway to pursue.
445,XXXI,
446,XXXII,XXXII
447,XXXII,"For far the warrior fared not, ere he spied,"
448,XXXII,"Bounding across the path, his gallant steed,"
449,XXXII,"And, ""Stay, Bayardo mine,"" Rinaldo cried,"
450,XXXII,"""Too cruel care the loss of thee does breed."""
451,XXXII,"The horse for this returned not to his side,"
452,XXXII,"Deaf to his prayer, but flew with better speed."
453,XXXII,"Furious, in chase of him, Rinaldo hies."
454,XXXII,"But follow we Angelica, who flies."
455,XXXII,
456,XXXIII,XXXIII
457,XXXIII,"Through dreary woods and dark the damsel fled,"
458,XXXIII,"By rude unharboured heath and savage height,"
459,XXXIII,"While every leaf or spray that rustled, bred"
460,XXXIII,"(Of oak, or elm, or beech), such new affright,"
461,XXXIII,She here and there her foaming palfrey sped
462,XXXIII,By strange and crooked paths with furious flight;
463,XXXIII,"And at each shadow, seen in valley blind,"
464,XXXIII,"Or mountain, feared Rinaldo was behind."
465,XXXIII,
466,XXXIV,XXXIV
467,XXXIV,"As a young roe or fawn of fallow deer,"
468,XXXIV,"Who, mid the shelter of its native glade,"
469,XXXIV,Has seen a hungry pard or tiger tear
470,XXXIV,"The bosom of its bleeding dam, dismayed,"
471,XXXIV,"Bounds, through the forest green in ceaseless fear"
472,XXXIV,"Of the destroying beast, from shade to shade,"
473,XXXIV,"And at each sapling touched, amid its pangs,"
474,XXXIV,"Believes itself between the monster's fangs,"
475,XXXIV,
476,XXXV,XXXV
477,XXXV,"One day and night, and half the following day,"
478,XXXV,"The damsel wanders wide, nor whither knows;"
479,XXXV,"Then enters a deep wood, whose branches play,"
480,XXXV,Moved lightly by the freshening breeze which blows.
481,XXXV,Through this two clear and murmuring rivers stray:
482,XXXV,Upon their banks a fresher herbage grows;
483,XXXV,"While the twin streams their passage slowly clear,"
484,XXXV,"Make music with the stones, and please the ear."
485,XXXV,
486,XXXVI,XXXVI
487,XXXVI,"Weening removed the way by which she wends,"
488,XXXVI,"A thousand miles from loathed Rinaldo's beat,"
489,XXXVI,"To rest herself a while the maid intends,"
490,XXXVI,Wearied with that long flight and summer's heat.
491,XXXVI,She from her saddle 'mid spring flowers descends
492,XXXVI,And takes the bridle from her courser fleet.
493,XXXVI,"And loose along the river lets him pass,"
494,XXXVI,Roving the banks in search of lusty grass.
495,XXXVI,
496,XXXVII,XXXVII
497,XXXVII,Behold! at hand a thicket she surveys
498,XXXVII,Gay with the flowering thorn and vermeil rose:
499,XXXVII,The tuft reflected in the stream which strays
500,XXXVII,"Beside it, overshadowing oaks enclose."
501,XXXVII,"Hollow within, and safe from vulgar gaze,"
502,XXXVII,It seemed a place constructed for repose;
503,XXXVII,"With bows so interwoven, that the light"
504,XXXVII,"Pierced not the tangled screen, far less the sight."
505,XXXVII,
506,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
507,XXXVIII,Within soft moss and herbage form a bed;
508,XXXVIII,And to delay and rest the traveller woo.
509,XXXVIII,"'Twas there her limbs the weary damsel spread,"
510,XXXVIII,Her eye-balls bathed in slumber's balmy dew.
511,XXXVIII,"But little time had eased her drooping head,"
512,XXXVIII,"Ere, as she weened, a courser's tramp she knew."
513,XXXVIII,"Softly she rises, and the river near,"
514,XXXVIII,"Armed cap-a-pie, beholds a cavalier."
515,XXXVIII,
516,XXXIX,XXXIX
517,XXXIX,"If friend or foe, she nothing comprehends,"
518,XXXIX,(So hope and fear her doubting bosom tear)
519,XXXIX,"And that adventure's issue mute attends,"
520,XXXIX,Nor even with a sigh disturbs the air.
521,XXXIX,The cavalier upon the bank descends;
522,XXXIX,"And sits so motionless, so lost in care,"
523,XXXIX,(His visage propt upon his arm) to sight
524,XXXIX,Changed into senseless stone appeared the knight.
525,XXXIX,
526,XL,XL
527,XL,"Pensive, above an hour, with drooping head,"
528,XL,"He rested mute, ere he began his moan;"
529,XL,"And then his piteous tale of sorrow said,"
530,XL,"Lamenting in so soft and sweet a tone,"
531,XL,"He in a tiger's breast had pity bred,"
532,XL,Or with his mournful wailings rent a stone.
533,XL,And so he sighed and wept; like rivers flowed
534,XL,"His tears, his bosom like an Aetna glowed."
535,XL,
536,XLI,XLI
537,XLI,"""Thought which now makes me burn, now freeze with hate,"
538,XLI,Which gnaws my heart and rankles at its root!
539,XLI,"What's left to me,"" he said, ""arrived too late,"
540,XLI,While one more favoured bears away the fruit?
541,XLI,"Bare words and looks scarce cheered my hopeless state,"
542,XLI,And the prime spoils reward another's suit.
543,XLI,"Then since for me nor fruit nor blossom hangs,"
544,XLI,Why should I longer pine in hopeless pangs?

546,XLII,XLII
547,XLII,"""The virgin has her image in the rose"
548,XLII,"Sheltered in garden on its native stock,"

550,XLII,Blooms unapproached by sheperd or by flock.
551,XLII,"For this earth teems, and freshening water flows,"
552,XLII,And breeze and dewy dawn their sweets unlock:
553,XLII,With such the wistful youth his bosom dresses.
554,XLII,With such the enamored damsel braids her tresses.
555,XLII,
556,XLIII,XLIII
557,XLIII,"""But wanton hands no sooner this displace"
558,XLIII,"From the maternal stem, where it was grown,"

560,XLIII,"It found with man or heaven; bloom, beauty, gone."
561,XLIII,The damsel who should hold in higher place
562,XLIII,"Than light or life the flower which is her own,"
563,XLIII,"Suffering the spoiler's hand to crop the prize,"
564,XLIII,Forfeits her worth in every other's eyes.

569,XLIV,Ah! false and cruel Fortune! foul despite!
570,XLIV,"While others triumph, I am drown'd in woe."
571,XLIV,And can it be that I such treasure slight?
572,XLIV,And can I then my very life forego?
573,XLIV,No! let me die; 'twere happiness above
574,XLIV,"A longer life, if I must cease to love."""
575,XLIV,
576,XLV,XLV
577,XLV,"If any ask who made this sorrowing,"
578,XLV,"And pour'd into the stream so many tears,"
579,XLV,"I answer, it was fair Circassia's king,"
580,XLV,"That Sacripant, oppressed with amorous cares."
581,XLV,"Love is the source from which his troubles spring,"
582,XLV,The sole occasion of his pains and fears;

584,XLV,Now well remembered by the royal maid.
585,XLV,
586,XLVI,XLVI
587,XLVI,He for her sake from Orient's farthest reign
588,XLVI,"Roved thither, where the sun descends to rest;"
589,XLVI,"For he was told in India, to his pain,"
590,XLVI,That she Orlando followed to the west.
591,XLVI,He after learned in France that Charlemagne
592,XLVI,"Secluded from that champion and the rest,"
593,XLVI,"As a fit guerdon, mewed her for the knight"
594,XLVI,Who should protect the lilies best in fight.

600,XLVII,Nor of the damsel's footsteps found a trace.
601,XLVII,"And this is what the weeping monarch rued,"
602,XLVII,And this he so bewailed in doleful case:
603,XLVII,"Hence, into words his lamentations run,"
604,XLVII,Which might for pity stop the passing sun.
605,XLVII,
606,XLVIII,XLVIII
607,XLVIII,"While Sacripant laments him in this plight,"
608,XLVIII,And makes a tepid fountain of his eyes;
609,XLVIII,"And, what I deem not needful to recite,"
610,XLVIII,Pours forth yet other plaints and piteous cries;
611,XLVIII,Propitious Fortune will his lady bright
612,XLVIII,Should hear the youth lament him in such wise:
613,XLVIII,"And thus a moment compassed what, without"
614,XLVIII,"Such chance, long ages had not brought about."
615,XLVIII,
616,XLIX,XLIX
617,XLIX,"With deep attention, while the warrior weeps,"
618,XLIX,She marks the fashion of the grief and tears
619,XLIX,"And words of him, whose passion never sleeps;"
620,XLIX,Nor this the first confession which she hears.
621,XLIX,"But with his plaint her heart no measure keeps,"
622,XLIX,Cold as the column which the builder rears.
623,XLIX,"Like haughty maid, who holds herself above"

631,L,"Nor will she, if she let the occasion sleep,"

633,L,For she that king by long experience knew
634,L,"Above all other lovers, kind and true."
635,L,
636,LI,LI
637,LI,But not the more for this the maid intends
638,LI,"To heal the mischief which her charms had wrought,"
639,LI,And for past ills to furnish glad amends
640,LI,In that full bliss by pining lover sought.
641,LI,"To keep the king in play are all her ends,"
642,LI,"His help by some device or fiction bought,"

646,LII,LII
647,LII,"An apparition bright and unforeseen,"

659,LIII,"As dead, lamented still with tears and sighs,"
660,LIII,Since the thinned files without her boy returned.
661,LIII,-- Not such her rapture as the king's surprise
662,LIII,And ecstasy of joy when he discerned
663,LIII,"The lofty presence, cheeks of heavenly hue,"
664,LIII,And lovely form which broke upon his view.
665,LIII,
666,LIV,LIV
667,LIV,"He, full of fond and eager passion, pressed"
668,LIV,"Towards his Lady, his Divinity;"
669,LIV,"And she now clasped the warrior to her breast,"
670,LIV,Who in Catay had haply been less free.
671,LIV,And now again the maid her thoughts addressed
672,LIV,Towards her native land and empery:
673,LIV,"And feels, with hope revived, her bosom beat"
674,LIV,Shortly to repossess her sumptuous seat.
675,LIV,
676,LV,LV
677,LV,"Her chances all to him the damsel said,"
678,LV,Since he was eastward sent to Sericane
679,LV,"By her to seek the martial monarch's aid,"
680,LV,Who swayed the sceptre of that fair domain;
681,LV,And told how oft Orlando's friendly blade
682,LV,"Had saved her from dishonour, death, and pain;"
683,LV,And how she so preserved her virgin flower
684,LV,Pure as it blossomed in her natal hour.
685,LV,
686,LVI,LVI
687,LVI,Haply the tale was true; yet will not seem
688,LVI,Likely to one of sober sense possessed:
689,LVI,"But Sacripant, who waked from worser dream,"
690,LVI,In all without a cavil acquiesced:
691,LVI,"Since love, who sees without one guiding gleam,"
692,LVI,Spies in broad day but that which likes him best:
693,LVI,For one sign of the afflicted man's disease
694,LVI,Is to give ready faith to things which please.

721,LIX,"He donned his helm (his other arms he wears),"
722,LIX,"Aye wont to rove in steel, with belted blade,"

735,LX,
736,LXI,LXI
737,LXI,"Him he defies to fight, approaching nigh,"

740,LXI,His warlike prowess puts to present test;
741,LXI,"Cuts short his haughty threats and angry cry,"
742,LXI,"And spurs, and lays his levelled lance in rest."
743,LXI,"In tempest wheels Circassia's valiant peer,"

745,LXI,
746,LXII,LXII
747,LXII,Not brindled bulls or tawny lions spring
748,LXII,To forest warfare with such deadly will

751,LXII,"The solid ground, at their encountering,"
752,LXII,Trembles from fruitful vale to naked hill:

754,LXII,"Their bodies was of proof, and saved the breast."
755,LXII,
756,LXIII,LXIII

919,LXXIX,"The maid no sooner had Rinaldo spied,"
920,LXXIX,Than on her laughing eyes deep darkness sate:
921,LXXIX,And with sad mien and trembling voice she cried
922,LXXIX,"To Sacripant, and prayed him not to wait"

930,LXXX,Sufficient to make yonder champion flee?

964,I,Two hearts should with a different measure beat?
965,I,"Thou wilt not let me take the certain ford,"

970,II,II
971,II,"Thou to Rinaldo show'st the damsel fair,"

974,II,"Paid back with deepest hate her amorous flame,"
975,II,"Now pines, himself, the victim of despair,"
976,II,"Scorned in his turn, and his reward the same."

1021,VII,"He, when the king would urge him, takes the rest,"
1022,VII,"Or, when he curbs him, runs in giddy rings;"

1024,VII,"And plays his spine, and runs an-end and flings."
1025,VII,"And now the furious Saracen distressed,"
1026,VII,"Sees 'tis no time to tame the beast, and springs,"
1027,VII,"With one hand on the pummel, to the ground;"
1028,VII,Clear of the restless courser at a bound.

1035,VIII,"Their sounding blades such changeful measure keep,"
1036,VIII,The hammer-strokes of Vulcan with less speed

1038,VIII,And Jove's red thunders on his anvil beats.

1040,IX,IX
1041,IX,"Sometimes they lunge, then feign the thrust and parry:"
1042,IX,Deep masters of the desperate game they play;
1043,IX,"Or rise upon the furious stroke, and carry"
1044,IX,"Their swords aloft, or stoop and stand at bay."
1045,IX,"Again they close, again exhausted tarry;"
1046,IX,"Now hide, now show themselves, and now give way,"

1052,X,Strikes full at Sacripant with lifted blade;

1054,X,And well with strong and stubborn steel inlaid:
1055,X,"Though passing thick, Fusberta cleaves it: groan"
1056,X,"Greenwood, and covert close, and sunny glade."

1063,XI,"She, like the criminal, whose doom is nigh,"
1064,XI,"Changed her fair countenance through sore dismay,"

1066,XI,"If she would not be that Rinaldo's prey,"
1067,XI,"Rinaldo loathed by her as much, as he"
1068,XI,Doats on the scornful damsel miserably.
1069,XI,
1070,XII,XII
1071,XII,"So turned her horse into the gloomy chase,"
1072,XII,And drove him through rough path and tangled ally
1073,XII,"And oftentimes bent back her bloodless face,"
1074,XII,And saw Rinaldo from each thicket sally.
1075,XII,"Nor flying long had urged the frantic race,"
1076,XII,Before she met a hermit in a valley.
1077,XII,"Devotion in his aspect was expressed,"
1078,XII,And his long beard descended on his breast.
1079,XII,
1080,XIII,XIII
1081,XIII,"Wasted he was as much by fasts as age,"
1082,XIII,"And on an ass was mounted, slow and sure;"
1083,XIII,His visage warranted that never sage
1084,XIII,Had conscience more precise or passing pure.
1085,XIII,Though in his arteries time had stilled the rage
1086,XIII,"Of blood, and spake him feeble and demure,"
1087,XIII,"At sight of the delighted damsel, he"
1088,XIII,Was inly stirred for very charity.
1089,XIII,
1090,XIV,XIV
1091,XIV,"The lady prayed that kindly friar, that he"
1092,XIV,"Would straight conduct her to some haven near,"
1093,XIV,"For that she from the land of France might flee,"
1094,XIV,And never more of loathed Rinaldo hear.
1095,XIV,"The hermit, who was skilled in sorcery,"
1096,XIV,Ceased not to soothe the gentle damsel's fear.
1097,XIV,"And with the promise of deliverance, shook"
1098,XIV,"His pocket, and drew forth a secret book."
1099,XIV,
1100,XV,XV
1101,XV,"This opened, quick and mighty marvel wrought;"
1102,XV,"For not a leaf is finished by the sage,"
1103,XV,"Before a spirit, by his bidding brought,"
1104,XV,Waits his command in likeness of a page:
1105,XV,"He, by the magic writ constrained and taught,"
1106,XV,"Hastes where the warriors face to face engage,"
1107,XV,In the cool shade -- but not in cool disport --
1108,XV,"And steps between, and stops their battle short."
1109,XV,
1110,XVI,XVI
1111,XVI,"""In courtesy,"" he cried, ""let either show"
1112,XVI,"What his foe's death to either can avail,"
1113,XVI,And what the guerdon conquest will bestow
1114,XVI,"On him who in the battle shall prevail,"
1115,XVI,"If Roland, though he has not struck a blow,"
1116,XVI,"Or snapt in fight a single link of mail,"
1117,XVI,"To Paris-town conveys the damsel gay,"
1118,XVI,Who has engaged you in this bitter fray.
1119,XVI,
1120,XVII,XVII
1121,XVII,"""Within an easy mile I saw the peer"
1122,XVII,Pricking to Paris with that lady bright;
1123,XVII,"Riding, in merry mood, with laugh and jeer,"
1124,XVII,And mocking at your fierce and fruitless fight.
1125,XVII,"Sure it were better, while they yet are near,"
1126,XVII,To follow peer and damsel in their flight:
1127,XVII,For should he once in Paris place his prize
1128,XVII,"The lady never more shall meet your eyes."""
1129,XVII,
1130,XVIII,XVIII
1131,XVIII,You might have seen those angry cavaliers
1132,XVIII,Change at the demon's tale for rage and shame;
1133,XVIII,"And curse themselves as wanting eyes and ears,"
1134,XVIII,To let their rival cheat them of the dame.
1135,XVIII,"Towards his horse the good Rinaldo steers,"
1136,XVIII,Breathing forth piteous sighs which seem of flame;
1137,XVIII,"And, if he joins Orlando -- ere they part --"
1138,XVIII,Swears in his fury he will have his heart.
1139,XVIII,
1140,XIX,XIX
1141,XIX,"So, passing where the prompt Bayardo stood,"
1142,XIX,"Leaps on his back, and leaves, as swift as wind,"
1143,XIX,"Without farewell, his rival in the wood;"
1144,XIX,Much less invites him to a seat behind.
1145,XIX,"The goaded charger, in his heat of blood,"
1146,XIX,"Forces whate'er his eager course confined,"
1147,XIX,"Ditch, river, tangled thorn, or marble block;"
1148,XIX,"He swims the river, and he clears the rock."
1149,XIX,
1150,XX,XX
1151,XX,"Let it not, sir, sound strangely in your ear"
1152,XX,"Rinaldo took the steed thus readily,"
1153,XX,So long and vainly followed far and near;
1154,XX,"For he, endued with reasoning faculty,"
1155,XX,"Had not in vice lured on the following peer,"
1156,XX,"But fled before his cherished lord, that he"
1157,XX,"Might guide him whither went the gentle dame,"
1158,XX,"For whom, as he had heard, he nursed a flame."
1159,XX,
1160,XXI,XXI
1161,XXI,"For when Angelica, in random dread,"
1162,XXI,"From the pavilion winged her rapid flight,"
1163,XXI,"Bayardo marked the damsel as she fled,"
1164,XXI,His saddle lightened of Mount Alban's knight;
1165,XXI,"Who then on foot an equal combat sped,"
1166,XXI,Matched with a baron of no meaner might;
1167,XXI,"And chased the maid by woods, and floods, and strands,"
1168,XXI,In hopes to place her in the warrior's hands.
1169,XXI,
1170,XXII,XXII
1171,XXII,"And, with desire to bring him to the maid,"
1172,XXII,Gallopped before him still with rampant play;
1173,XXII,"But would not let his master mount, afraid"
1174,XXII,That he might make him take another way.
1175,XXII,"So luring on Rinaldo through the shade,"
1176,XXII,Twice brought him to his unexpected prey;
1177,XXII,Twice foiled in his endeavour: once by bold
1178,XXII,"Ferrau; then Sacripant, as lately told."
1179,XXII,
1180,XXIII,XXIII
1181,XXIII,Now good Bayardo had believed the tiding
1182,XXIII,"Of that fair damsel, which produced the accord;"
1183,XXIII,"And in the devil's cunning tale confiding,"
1184,XXIII,Renewed his wonted service to his lord.
1185,XXIII,"Behold Rinaldo then in fury riding,"
1186,XXIII,And pushing still his courser Paris-ward!
1187,XXIII,"Though he fly fast, the champion's wishes go"
1188,XXIII,Faster; and wind itself had seemed too slow.
1189,XXIII,
1190,XXIV,XXIV
1191,XXIV,"At night Rinaldo rests his steed, with pain"
1192,XXIV,To meet Anglante's lord he burned so sore;
1193,XXIV,And lent such credit to the tidings vain
1194,XXIV,Of the false courier of that wizard hoar:
1195,XXIV,"And that day and the next, with flowing rein,"
1196,XXIV,"Rode, till the royal city rose before"
1197,XXIV,"His eyes; where Charlemagne had taken post,"
1198,XXIV,With the sad remnant of his broken host.
1199,XXIV,
1200,XXV,XXV
1201,XXV,"He, for he fears the Afric king's pursuit,"
1202,XXV,"And sap and siege, upon his vassals calls"
1203,XXV,"To gather in fresh victual, and recruit"
1204,XXV,"And cleanse their ditches, and repair their walls."
1205,XXV,"And what may best annoy the foes, and suit"
1206,XXV,"For safety, without more delay forestalls;"
1207,XXV,"And plans an embassy to England, thence"
1208,XXV,To gather fresher forces for defence.
1209,XXV,
1210,XXVI,XXVI
1211,XXVI,For he is bent again to try the fate
1212,XXVI,"Of arms in tented field, though lately shamed;"
1213,XXVI,And send Rinaldo to the neighbouring state
1214,XXVI,"Of Britain, which was after England named."
1215,XXVI,Ill liked the Paladin to cross the strait;
1216,XXVI,"Not that the people or the land he blamed,"
1217,XXVI,But that King Charles was sudden; nor a day
1218,XXVI,Would grant the valiant envoy for delay.
1219,XXVI,
1220,XXVII,XXVII
1221,XXVII,Rinaldo never executed thing
1222,XXVII,"Less willingly, prevented in his quest"
1223,XXVII,"Of that fair visage he was following,"
1224,XXVII,Whose charms his heart had ravished from his breast.
1225,XXVII,"Yet, in obediance to the christian king,"
1226,XXVII,Prepared himself to do the royal hest.
1227,XXVII,"To Calais the good envoy wends with speed,"
1228,XXVII,And the same day embarks himself and steed.
1229,XXVII,
1230,XXVIII,XXVIII
1231,XXVIII,"And there, in scorn of cautious pilot's skill"
1232,XXVIII,"(Such his impatience to regain his home),"
1233,XXVIII,"Launched on the doubtful sea, which boded ill,"
1234,XXVIII,"And rolled its heavy billows, white with foam."
1235,XXVIII,"The wind, enraged that he opposed his will,"
1236,XXVIII,"Stirred up the waves; and, 'mid the gathering gloom,"
1237,XXVIII,"So the loud storm and tempest's fury grew,"
1238,XXVIII,That topmast-high the flashing waters flew.
1239,XXVIII,
1240,XXIX,XXIX
1241,XXIX,"The watchful mariners, in wary sort,"
1242,XXIX,"Haul down the mainsail, and attempt to wear;"
1243,XXIX,"And would put back in panic to the port,"
1244,XXIX,"Whence, in ill hour, they loosed with little care."
1245,XXIX,"-- ""Not so,"" exclaims the wind, and stops them short,"
1246,XXIX,"""So poor a penance will not pay the dare."""
1247,XXIX,"And when they fain would veer, with fiercer roar"
1248,XXIX,Pelts back their reeling prow and blusters more.
1249,XXIX,
1250,XXX,XXX
1251,XXX,"Starboard and larboard bears the fitful gale,"
1252,XXX,And never for a thought its ire assuages;
1253,XXX,While the strained vessel drives with humble sail
1254,XXX,"Before the billows, as the tempest rages."
1255,XXX,"But I, who still pursue a varying tale,"
1256,XXX,"Must leave awhile the Paladin, who wages"
1257,XXX,A weary warfare with the wind and flood;
1258,XXX,To follow a fair virgin of his blood.
1259,XXX,
1260,XXXI,XXXI
1261,XXXI,"I speak of that famed damsel, by whose spear"
1262,XXXI,"O'erthrown, King Sacripant on earth was flung;"
1263,XXXI,"The worthy sister of the valiant peer,"
1264,XXXI,From Beatrix and good Duke Aymon sprung.
1265,XXXI,By daring deeds and puissance no less dear
1266,XXXI,To Charlemagne and France: Since proved among
1267,XXXI,"The first, her prowess, tried by many a test,"
1268,XXXI,Equal to good Rinaldo's shone confessed.
1269,XXXI,
1270,XXXII,XXXII
1271,XXXII,"A cavalier was suitor to the dame,"
1272,XXXII,Who out of Afric passed with Agramant;
1273,XXXII,"Rogero was his valiant father's name,"
1274,XXXII,His mother was the child of Agolant.
1275,XXXII,"And she, who not of bear or lion came,"
1276,XXXII,"Disdained not on the Child her love to plant,"
1277,XXXII,"Though cruel Fortune, ill their wishes meeting,"
1278,XXXII,Had granted to the pair a single greeting.
1279,XXXII,
1280,XXXIII,XXXIII
1281,XXXIII,Alone thenceforth she sought her lover (he
1282,XXXIII,"Was named of him to whom he owed his birth),"
1283,XXXIII,And roved as safe as if in company
1284,XXXIII,"Of thousands, trusting in her single worth."
1285,XXXIII,She having made the king of Circassy
1286,XXXIII,"Salute the visage of old mother earth,"
1287,XXXIII,"Traversed a wood, and that wood past, a mountain;"
1288,XXXIII,And stopt at length beside a lovely fountain.
1289,XXXIII,
1290,XXXIV,XXXIV
1291,XXXIV,"Through a delicious mead the fountain-rill,"
1292,XXXIV,"By ancient trees o'ershaded, glides away;"
1293,XXXIV,"And him whose ear its pleasing murmurs fill,"
1294,XXXIV,"Invites to drink, and on its banks to stay;"
1295,XXXIV,On the left side a cultivated hill
1296,XXXIV,Excludes the fervors of the middle day.
1297,XXXIV,"As first the damsel thither turns her eyes,"
1298,XXXIV,A youthful cavalier she seated spies;

1300,XXXV,XXXV
1301,XXXV,"A cavalier, who underneath the shade,"
1302,XXXV,"Seems lost, as in a melancholy dream;"

1304,XXXV,"Reposing, overhangs the crystal stream."
1305,XXXV,"His horse beneath a spreading beech is laid,"
1306,XXXV,And from a bough the shield and helmet gleam.
1307,XXXV,"While his moist eyes, and sad and downcast air,"
1308,XXXV,Speak him the broken victim of despair.
1309,XXXV,
1310,XXXVI,XXXVI
1311,XXXVI,"Urged by the passion lodged in every breast,"
1312,XXXVI,A restless curiosity to know
1313,XXXVI,"Of others' cares, the gentle maid addressed"
1314,XXXVI,"The knight, and sought the occasion of his woe."
1315,XXXVI,"And he to her his secret grief confessed,"
1316,XXXVI,"Won by her gentle speech and courteous show,"
1317,XXXVI,"And by that gallant bearing, which at sight,"

1321,XXXVII,"""Fair sir, a band of horse and foot,"" he said,"

1324,XXXVII,Descending from the Pyrenean crest;
1325,XXXVII,"And in my company a damsel led,"
1326,XXXVII,Whose charms with fervid love had fired my breast.
1327,XXXVII,"When, as we journey by Rhone's current, I"
1328,XXXVII,A rider on a winged courser spy.

1335,XXXVIII,"Sank in a thought and rose; and soaring, laid"
1336,XXXVIII,"Hands on his prize, and snatched her from below."
1337,XXXVIII,"So quick the rape, that all appeared a dream,"

1345,XXXIX,"I cannot reach the mountain-robber's den,"
1346,XXXIX,"Compassed with cliffs, or follow one who flies."

1364,XLI,"Nor sign, nor vestiges of man were near."
1365,XLI,"At last a dark and barren vale I won,"
1366,XLI,Where caverned mountains and rude cliffs appear;
1367,XLI,"Where in the middle rose a rugged block,"

1370,XLII,XLII
1371,XLII,"""From far it shone like flame, and seemed not dight"

1374,XLII,"The walls appeared, as I approached more nigh."
1375,XLII,"I, after, learned that it was built by sprite"
1376,XLII,Whom potent fumes had raised and sorcery:
1377,XLII,"Who on this rock its towers of steel did fix,"
1378,XLII,Case-hardened in the stream and fire of Styx.

1385,XLIII,Nothing is safe which he would bear away;
1386,XLIII,Pursued with curses and with threats in vain.

1394,XLIV,Standing beneath the ravening eagle's nest;
1395,XLIV,"And since she has not wings to rise and fly,"
1396,XLIV,Runs round the rugged rock with hopeless quest.
1397,XLIV,So inaccessible the wild dominion

1405,XLV,"Both barons bold, and fearful in their ire:"
1406,XLV,"The one Gradasso, King of Sericane,"

1424,XLVII,"Which winds about the craggy mountain, press."
1425,XLVII,"While I, upon the summit left alone,"
1426,XLVII,"Look on, and pray to God for their success."
1427,XLVII,Beneath the wily wizard's castle strong

1444,XLIX,Running and scarcely rising from the plain;
1445,XLIX,"But when the flock is launched and scattered, flings"
1446,XLIX,"His pinions to the wind, and soars amain."

1475,LII,"Beneath the wizard's blow the warrior bent,"
1476,LII,Which made some deal his generous courser ply;

1530,LVIII,LVIII
1531,LVIII,"The knight relapsed into his first disease,"
1532,LVIII,After his melancholy tale was done.

1534,LVIII,Anselmo d'Altaripa's faithless son.
1535,LVIII,"He, where the blood ran foul through all degrees,"
1536,LVIII,Disdained to be the only virtuous one;

1538,LVIII,Passing in vice the villains of his race.
1539,LVIII,
1540,LIX,LIX
1541,LIX,"With aspect changing still, the beauteous dame"

1544,LIX,Her radiant face with eager joy dilates.
1545,LIX,"But, full of pity, kindles into flame"
1546,LIX,As Pinabel his cruel durance states.
1547,LIX,"Nor finds she, though twice told, the story stale;"
1548,LIX,But makes him oft repeat and piece his tale.
1549,LIX,
1550,LX,LX
1551,LX,"And, after, when she deemed that all was clear,"
1552,LX,"Cried to the knight, ""Repose upon my say."

1554,LX,And thou as fortunate account this day.
1555,LX,"Straight wend me to the keep, sir cavalier,"
1556,LX,Which holds a jewel of so rich a ray:

1564,LXI,Where every thing is lost I prize below.
1565,LXI,"But you would climb yon cliffs, and for your gains"

1575,LXII,"When lo! a messenger, in furious course,"

1591,LXIV,"This goodly town, with many miles of plain,"

1594,LXIV,Such trust he placed in her fidelity.
1595,LXIV,Still wont with wonder on the tented plain
1596,LXIV,The prowess of that valiant maid to see.
1597,LXIV,"And now the panting courier, as I said,"
1598,LXIV,Rode from Marseilles to ask the lady's aid.
1599,LXIV,
1600,LXV,LXV
1601,LXV,"Whether or not she should the call obey,"
1602,LXV,The youthful damsel doubts some little space;
1603,LXV,"Strong in one balance Fame and Duty weigh,"
1604,LXV,But softer thoughts both Fame and Duty chase:
1605,LXV,"And she, at length, resolved the emprize to assay,"
1606,LXV,And free Rogero from the enchanted place:
1607,LXV,"Or, should her valour in the adventure fail,"
1608,LXV,Would with the cherished lover share his jail.
1609,LXV,
1610,LXVI,LXVI
1611,LXVI,"And did with such excuse that post appay,"
1612,LXVI,He was contented on her will to wait:
1613,LXVI,Then turned the bridle to resume her way
1614,LXVI,"With Pinabel, who seemed no whit elate."
1615,LXVI,"Since of that line he knows the damsel gay,"
1616,LXVI,Held in such open and such secret hate;
1617,LXVI,"And future trouble to himself foresees,"
1618,LXVI,Were he detected as a Maganzese.
1619,LXVI,
1620,LXVII,LXVII
1621,LXVII,For 'twixt Maganza's and old Clermont's line
1622,LXVII,There was an ancient and a deadly feud:
1623,LXVII,"And oft to blows the rival houses came,"
1624,LXVII,And oft in civil blood their hands embrued.
1625,LXVII,And hence some treason to this gentle dame
1626,LXVII,"In his foul heart, the wicked County brewed;"
1627,LXVII,"Or, as the first occasion served, would stray"
1628,LXVII,"Out of the road, and leave her by the way."
1629,LXVII,
1630,LXVIII,LXVIII
1631,LXVIII,And so the traitor's troubled fancy rack
1632,LXVIII,"Fear, doubt, and his own native, rancorous mood,"
1633,LXVIII,"That unawares he issued from the track,"
1634,LXVIII,And found himself within a gloomy wood:
1635,LXVIII,"Where a rough mountain reared its shaggy back,"
1636,LXVIII,Whose stony peak above the forest stood;
1637,LXVIII,"The daughter of Dodona's duke behind,"
1638,LXVIII,Dogging his footsteps through the thicket blind.
1639,LXVIII,
1640,LXIX,LXIX
1641,LXIX,"He, when he saw himself within the brake,"
1642,LXIX,Thought to abandon his unweeting foe;
1643,LXIX,"And to the dame -- "" 'Twere better that we make"
1644,LXIX,For shelter ere the gathering darkness grow;
1645,LXIX,"And, yonder mountain past, (save I mistake)"
1646,LXIX,A tower is seated in the vale below.

1648,LXIX,"I measure the remembered place I seek."""
1649,LXIX,
1650,LXX,LXX
1651,LXX,"So said, he pushed his courser up the height"
1652,LXX,Of that lone mountain; in his evil mind
1653,LXX,"Revolving, as he went, some scheme or sleight"
1654,LXX,To rid him of the gentle dame behind.
1655,LXX,"When lo! a rocky cavern met his sight,"
1656,LXX,Amid those precipices dark and blind:

1666,LXXI,"Suspended there, and pondering on her doom:"

1670,LXXII,LXXII
1671,LXXII,When her approach the County's first intent
1672,LXXII,"Made vain, the wily traitor sought to mend"

1674,LXXII,"To rid her thence, or bring her to her end."
1675,LXXII,"And so to meet the approaching lady went,"
1676,LXXII,"And showed the cave, and prayed her to ascend;"
1677,LXXII,And said that in its bottom he had seen
1678,LXXII,A gentle damsel of bewitching mien.
1679,LXXII,
1680,LXXIII,LXXIII
1681,LXXIII,"Who, by her lovely semblance and rich vest,"
1682,LXXIII,Appeared a lady of no mean degree;

1685,LXXIII,"And that when he towards the entrance pressed,"
1686,LXXIII,"To learn who that unhappy maid might be,"
1687,LXXIII,"One on the melancholy damsel flew,"

1694,LXXIV,Sought but the means to try the deep descent.
1695,LXXIV,"Then, looking round, descried an elm-tree old,"
1696,LXXIV,Which furnished present means for her intent:
1697,LXXIV,"And from the tree, with boughs and foliage stored,"
1698,LXXIV,"Lopt a long branch, and shaped it with her sword."

1700,LXXV,LXXV
1701,LXXV,"The severed end she to the count commended,"

1704,LXXV,"When asking if she had the skill to leap,"
1705,LXXV,"The traitor, with a laugh, his hands extended."
1706,LXXV,And plunged his helpless prey into the deep.

2650,XIV,"Unarmed and of so base a sort, her brand;"
2651,XIV,"For well, without his death, she may obtain"
2652,XIV,The costly ring; and so suspends her hand.
2653,XIV,"Brunello, off his guard, with little pain,"
2654,XIV,"She seized, and strongly bound with girding band:"
2655,XIV,Then to a lofty fir made fast the string;
2656,XIV,But from his finger first withdrew the ring.
2657,XIV,
2658,XV,XV
2659,XV,"Neither by tears, nor groans, nor sound of woe,"
2660,XV,To move the stedfast maid the dwarf had power:
2661,XV,"She down the rugged hill descended slow,"
2662,XV,Until she reached the plain beneath the tower.
2663,XV,"Then gave her bugle breath, the keep below,"
2664,XV,To call the castled wizard to the stower:
2665,XV,"And when the sound was finished, threatening cried,"
2666,XV,And called him to the combat and defied.
2667,XV,
2668,XVI,XVI
2669,XVI,"Not long within his gate the enchanter stayed,"
2670,XVI,After he heard the voice and bugle ring.
2671,XVI,"Against the foe, who seemed a man, arrayed"
2672,XVI,"In arms, with him the horse is on the wing."
2673,XVI,"But his appearance well consoled the maid,"
2674,XVI,"Who, with small cause for fear, beheld him bring"
2675,XVI,"Nor mace, nor rested lance, nor bitting sword,"
2676,XVI,Wherewith the corselet might be bruised or gored.
2677,XVI,
2678,XVII,XVII
2679,XVII,"On his left arm alone his shield he took,"
2680,XVII,Covered all o'er with silk of crimson hue;
2681,XVII,"In his right-hand he held an open book,"
2682,XVII,"Whence, as the enchanter read, strange wonder grew:"
2683,XVII,"For often times, to sight, the lance he shook;"
2684,XVII,And flinching eyelids could not hide the view;
2685,XVII,With tuck or mace he seemed to smite the foe:
2686,XVII,But sate aloof and had not struck a blow.
2687,XVII,
2688,XVIII,XVIII
2689,XVIII,"No empty fiction wrought by magic lore,"
2690,XVIII,But natural was the steed the wizard pressed;
2691,XVIII,For him a filly to griffin bore;
2692,XVIII,"Hight hippogryph.  In wings and beak and crest,"
2693,XVIII,"Formed like his sire, as in the feet before;"
2694,XVIII,"But like the mare, his dam, in all the rest."
2695,XVIII,"Such on Riphaean hills, though rarely found,"
2696,XVIII,"Are bred, beyond the frozen ocean's bound."
2697,XVIII,
2698,XIX,XIX
2699,XIX,"Drawn by enchantment from his distant lair,"
2700,XIX,The wizard thought but how to tame the foal;
2701,XIX,"And, in a month, instructed him to bear"
2702,XIX,"Saddle and bit, and gallop to the goal;"
2703,XIX,"And execute on earth or in mid air,"
2704,XIX,"All shifts of manege, course and caracole;"
2705,XIX,"He with such labour wrought.  This only real,"
2706,XIX,Where all the rest was hollow and ideal.
2707,XIX,
2708,XX,XX
2709,XX,"This truth by him with fictions was combined,"
2710,XX,"Whose sleight passed red for yellow, black for white:"
2711,XX,But all his vain enchantments could not blind
2712,XX,"The maid, whose virtuous ring assured her sight:"
2713,XX,Yet she her blows discharges at the wind;
2714,XX,And spurring here and there prolongs the fight.
2715,XX,"So drove or wheeled her steed, and smote at nought,"
2716,XX,And practised all she had before been taught.
2717,XX,
2718,XXI,XXI
2719,XXI,"When she sometime had fought upon her horse,"
2720,XXI,She from the courser on her feet descends:
2721,XXI,"To compass and more freely put in force,"
2722,XXI,"As by the enchantress schooled, her wily ends."
2723,XXI,"The wizard, to display his last resource,"
2724,XXI,"Unweeting the defence, towards her wends."
2725,XXI,"He bares the shield, secure to blind his foe,"
2726,XXI,"And by the magic light, astonished, throw."
2727,XXI,
2728,XXII,XXII
2729,XXII,"The shield might have been shown at first, nor he"
2730,XXII,Needed to keep the cavaliers at bay;
2731,XXII,"But that he loved some master-stroke to see,"
2732,XXII,Achieved by lance or sword in single fray.
2733,XXII,"As with the captive mouse, in sportive glee,"
2734,XXII,The wily cat is sometimes seen to play;
2735,XXII,"Till waxing wroth, or weary of her prize,"
2736,XXII,"She bites, and at a snap the prisoner dies."
2737,XXII,
2738,XXIII,XXIII
2739,XXIII,"To cat and mouse, in battles fought before,"
2740,XXIII,I liken the magician and his foes;
2741,XXIII,But the comparison holds good no more:
2742,XXIII,"For, with the ring, the maid against him goes;"
2743,XXIII,"Firm and attentive still, and watching sore,"
2744,XXIII,Lest upon her the wizard should impose:
2745,XXIII,"And as she sees him bare the wondrous shield,"
2746,XXIII,Closes her eyes and falls upon the field.
2747,XXIII,
2748,XXIV,XXIV
2749,XXIV,"Not that the shining metal could offend,"
2750,XXIV,"As wont those others, from its cover freed;"
2751,XXIV,"But so the damsel did, to make descend"
2752,XXIV,The vain enchanter from his wondrous steed.
2753,XXIV,Nor was in ought defeated of her end;
2754,XXIV,For she no sooner on the grassy mead
2755,XXIV,"Had laid her head, than wheeling widely round,"
2756,XXIV,The flying courser pitched upon the ground.
2757,XXIV,
2758,XXV,XXV
2759,XXV,"Already cased again, the shield was hung,"
2760,XXV,"By the magician, at his sadle bow."
2761,XXV,"He lights and seeks her, who like wolf among"
2762,XXV,"The bushes, couched in thicket, waits the roe;"
2763,XXV,"She without more delay from ambush sprung,"
2764,XXV,"As he drew near, and grappled fast the foe."
2765,XXV,"That wretched man, the volume by whose aid"
2766,XXV,"He all his battles fought, on earth had laid:"
2767,XXV,
2768,XXVI,XXVI
2769,XXVI,"And ran to bind her with a chain, which he,"
2770,XXVI,"Girt round about him for such a purpose, wore;"
2771,XXVI,Because he deemed she was no less to be
2772,XXVI,Mastered and bound than those subdued before.
2773,XXVI,Him hath the dame already flung; by me
2774,XXVI,"Excused with reason, if he strove not more."
2775,XXVI,For fearful were the odds between that bold
2776,XXVI,"And puissant maid, and warrior weak and old!"
2777,XXVI,
2778,XXVII,XXVII
2779,XXVII,"Intending to behead the fallen foe,"
2780,XXVII,"She lifts her conquering hand; but in mid space,"
2781,XXVII,"When she beholds his visage, stops the blow,"
2782,XXVII,As if disdaining a revenge so base.
2783,XXVII,"She sees in him, her prowess has laid low,"
2784,XXVII,"A venerable sire, with sorrowing face;"
2785,XXVII,"Whose hair and wrinkles speak him, to her guess,"
2786,XXVII,"Of years six score and ten, or little less."
2787,XXVII,
2788,XXVIII,XXVIII
2789,XXVIII,"""Kill me, for love of God!"" (afflicted sore,"
2790,XXVIII,The old enchanter full of wrath did cry).
2791,XXVIII,But the victorious damsel was not more
2792,XXVIII,"Averse to kill, than he was bent to die."
2793,XXVIII,To know who was the necromancer hoar
2794,XXVIII,"The gentle lady had desire, and why"
2795,XXVIII,"The tower he in that savage place designed,"
2796,XXVIII,Doing such outrage foul to all mankind.
2797,XXVIII,
2798,XXIX,XXIX
2799,XXIX,"""Nor I, by malice moved, alas!  poor wight,"""
2800,XXIX,"(The weeping necromancer answer made,)"
2801,XXIX,"""Built the fair castle on the rocky height,"
2802,XXIX,Nor yet for rapine ply the robber's trade;
2803,XXIX,But only to redeem a gentle knight
2804,XXIX,"From danger sore and death, by love was swayed;"
2805,XXIX,"Who, as the skies foreshow, in little season,"
2806,XXIX,"Is doomed to die a Christian, and by treason."

2813,XXX,"By love of fame and evil stars beguiled,"
2814,XXX,He follows into France Troyano's heir.
2815,XXX,"Him, in my eyes, than son esteemed more dear,"
2816,XXX,I seek to snatch from France and peril near.

2823,XXXI,"And dames and knights, and more of high degree,"
2824,XXXI,"Have to this tower conveyed, his lot to share,"
2825,XXXI,"That with such partners of his prison pent,"

2833,XXXII,(Whatever heart can wish or tongue can sound)
2834,XXXII,"Cates, brave attire, game, sport, or mirthful measure."
2835,XXXII,"My field well sown, I well had reaped my grain."

2875,XXXVI,"So spake the scornful dame with angry mock,"

2877,XXXVI,
2878,XXXVII,XXXVII
2879,XXXVII,"Round by the conqueror with the chain he bore,"

2887,XXXVII,
2888,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
2889,XXXVIII,"Atlantes from the threshold, graved by skill,"
2890,XXXVIII,"With characters and wondrous signs, upturned"
2891,XXXVIII,"A virtuous stone, where, underneath the sill,"
2892,XXXVIII,"Pots, with perpetual fire and secret, burned."
2893,XXXVIII,The enchanter breaks them; and at once the hill
2894,XXXVIII,To an inhospitable rock is turned.
2895,XXXVIII,"Nor wall nor tower on any side is seen,"
2896,XXXVIII,As if no castle there had ever been.
2897,XXXVIII,
2898,XXXIX,XXXIX
2899,XXXIX,Then from the lady's toils the wizard clears
2900,XXXIX,"His limbs, as thrush escapes the fowler's snare;"
2901,XXXIX,"With him as well his castle disappears,"
2902,XXXIX,And leaves the prisoned troop in open air;
2903,XXXIX,"From their gay lodgings, dames and cavaliers,"
2904,XXXIX,"Unhoused upon that desert, bleak and bare."
2905,XXXIX,"And many at the freedom felt annoy,"
2906,XXXIX,Which dispossessed them of such life of joy.

2908,XL,XL
2909,XL,"There is Gradasso, there is Sacripant,"

2913,XL,"And there, at last, the lovely Bradamant"
2914,XL,"Discerns Rogero, long desired and dear;"

2916,XL,With joyful cheer to greet the damsel true;
2917,XL,
2918,XLI,XLI
2919,XLI,"As her he prized before his eyes, his heart,"
2920,XLI,His life; from that day cherished when she stood
2921,XLI,"Uncasqued for him, and from the fight apart;"
2922,XLI,And hence an arrow drank her virgin blood.
2923,XLI,"'Twere long to tell who launched the cruel dart,"
2924,XLI,And how the lovers wandered in the wood;
2925,XLI,"Now guided by the sun, and now benighted,"
2926,XLI,Here first since that encounter reunited.
2927,XLI,
2928,XLII,XLII
2929,XLII,"Now that the stripling sees her here, and knows"
2930,XLII,"Alone she freed him from the wizard's nest,"
2931,XLII,"He deems, his bosom with such joy overflows,"
2932,XLII,That he is singly fortunate and blest.
2933,XLII,"Thither, where late the damsel conquered, goes"
2934,XLII,"The band, descending from the mountain's crest;"
2935,XLII,"And finds the hippogryph, who bore the shield,"
2936,XLII,But in its case of crimson silk concealed.
2937,XLII,
2938,XLIII,XLIII
2939,XLIII,To take him by the rein the lady there
2940,XLIII,"Approached, and he stood fast till she was nigh,"
2941,XLIII,"Then spread his pinions to the liquid air,"
2942,XLIII,"And at short distance lit, half-mountain high:"
2943,XLIII,"And, as she follows him with fruitless care,"
2944,XLIII,Not longer flight nor shorter will he try.
2945,XLIII,"'Tis thus the raven, on some sandy beach,"
2946,XLIII,"Lures on the dog, and flits beyond his reach."
2947,XLIII,
2948,XLIV,XLIV
2949,XLIV,"Gradasso, Sacripant, Rogero, who"

2952,XLIV,"The beast, and up and down, each pass beset."
2953,XLIV,"He having led those others, as he flew,"
2954,XLIV,"Often to rocky height, and bottom wet,"
2955,XLIV,"Among the rocks of the moist valley dropt,"
2956,XLIV,And at short distance from Rogero stopt.

2958,XLV,XLV
2959,XLV,"This was Atlantes the enchanter's deed,"
2960,XLV,"Whose pious wishes still directed were,"
2961,XLV,To see Rogero from his peril freed:
2962,XLV,"This was his only thought, his only care;"
2963,XLV,"Who for such end dispatched the winged steed,"
2964,XLV,Him out of Europe by this sleight to bear.
2965,XLV,"Rogero took his bridle, but in vain;"
2966,XLV,For he was restive to the guiding rein.
2967,XLV,
2968,XLVI,XLVI
2969,XLVI,Now the bold youth from his Frontino flings
2970,XLVI,(Frontino was his gentle courser hight)
2971,XLVI,"Then leaps on him who towers in air, and stings"
2972,XLVI,And goads his haughty heart with rowels bright.
2973,XLVI,He runs a short career; then upward springs.
2974,XLVI,And through mid ether soars a fairer flight
2975,XLVI,"Than hawk, from which the falconer plucks away"
2976,XLVI,"In time the blinding hood, and points her prey."
2977,XLVI,
2978,XLVII,XLVII
2979,XLVII,"When her Rogero the fair dame discerned,"
2980,XLVII,"In fearful peril, soar so high a strain,"
2981,XLVII,"She stood long space amazed, ere she returned"
2982,XLVII,"To her right judgement, and sound wits again:"
2983,XLVII,"And what she erst of Ganymede had learned,"
2984,XLVII,"Snatched up to heaven from his paternal reign,"
2985,XLVII,"Feared might befall the stripling, born through air,"
2986,XLVII,As gentle as young Ganymede and fair.
2987,XLVII,
2988,XLVIII,XLVIII
2989,XLVIII,She on Rogero looks with stedfast eyes
2990,XLVIII,As long as feeble sight can serve her use;
2991,XLVIII,"And in her mind next tracks him through the skies,"
2992,XLVIII,When sight in vain the cherished youth pursues.
2993,XLVIII,"And still renewing tears, and groans, and sighs,"
2994,XLVIII,Will not afford her sorrow peace or truce.
2995,XLVIII,"After the knight had vanished from her view,"
2996,XLVIII,Her eyes she on the good Frontino threw.
2997,XLVIII,
2998,XLIX,XLIX
2999,XLIX,And lest the courser should become the prey
3000,XLIX,"Of the first traveller, who passed the glen,"
3001,XLIX,Him will not leave; but thence to bear away
3002,XLIX,"Resolves, in trust to see his lord again."
3003,XLIX,"The griffin soars, nor can Rogero stay"
3004,XLIX,"The flying courser; while, beneath his ken,"
3005,XLIX,"Each peak and promontory sinks in guise,"

3936,LXVIII,"For if the valiant champion were more near,"
3937,LXVIII,"(Such is his courage) or in any place,"
3938,LXVIII,"Whither in time the news might be conveyed,"
3939,LXVIII,He would not fail to bear his sister aid.
3940,LXVIII,
3941,LXX,LXX
3942,LXX,"""The king, mean time, who would the quest pursue,"
3943,LXX,"And by more certain proof than combat, try"
3944,LXX,"If the accuser's tale be false or true,"
3945,LXX,"And she deserve, or merit not, to die,"
3946,LXX,"Arrests some ladies of her retinue,"
3947,LXX,"That, as he weens, the fact can verify."
3948,LXX,"Whence I foresaw, that if I taken were,"
3949,LXX,Too certain risque the duke and I must share.
3950,LXX,
3951,LXXI,LXXI
3952,LXXI,"""That very night I from the palace flee,"
3953,LXXI,"And to the duke repair, escaped from court;"
3954,LXXI,"And, were I taken, make him plainly see"
3955,LXXI,How much it either's safety would import:
3956,LXXI,"He praised, and bade me of good courage be,"
3957,LXXI,"And, for his comfort, prayed me to resort"
3958,LXXI,To a strong castle which he held hard by;
3959,LXXI,And gave me two to bear me company.
3960,LXXI,
3961,LXXII,LXXII
3962,LXXII,"""With what full proofs, sir stranger, you have heard,"
3963,LXXII,I of my love assured the Scottish peer;
3964,LXXII,"And clearly can discern, if so preferred,"
3965,LXXII,That lord was justly bound to hold me dear.
3966,LXXII,"Mark, in conclusion, what was my reward;"
3967,LXXII,The glorious meed of my great merit hear!
3968,LXXII,"And say if woman can expect to earn,"
3969,LXXII,"However well she love, her love's return."
3970,LXXII,
3971,LXXIII,LXXIII
3972,LXXIII,"""For this perfidious, foul, ungrateful man,"
3973,LXXIII,"At length suspicious of my faith and zeal,"
3974,LXXIII,"And apprehending that his wily plan,"
3975,LXXIII,"In course of time, I haply might reveal,"
3976,LXXIII,Feigned that meanwhile the monarch's anger ran
3977,LXXIII,"Too high, he would withdraw me, and conceal"
3978,LXXIII,"Within a fortress of his own, where I"
3979,LXXIII,(Such was his real end) was doomed to die.
3980,LXXIII,
3981,LXXIV,LXXIV
3982,LXXIV,"""For secretly the duke enjoined the guide,"
3983,LXXIV,"Who with me through the gloomy forest went,"
3984,LXXIV,"The worthy guerdon of a faith so tried,"
3985,LXXIV,"To slay me; and had compassed his intent,"
3986,LXXIV,"But for your ready succour, when I cried."
3987,LXXIV,"Behold!  what wages love's poor slaves content."""
3988,LXXIV,"Thus to Rinaldo did Dalinda say,"
3989,LXXIV,As they together still pursued their way.
3990,LXXIV,
3991,LXXV,LXXV
3992,LXXV,"Above all other fortune, to the knight"
3993,LXXV,"Was welcome to have found the gentle maid,"
3994,LXXV,"Who the whole story of Geneura bright,"
3995,LXXV,And her unblemished innocence displayed;
3996,LXXV,"And, if he hoped, although accused with right,"
3997,LXXV,"To furnish the afflicted damsel aid,"
3998,LXXV,"Persuaded of the calumny's disproof,"
3999,LXXV,He with more courage warred in her behoof.
4000,LXXV,
4001,LXXVI,LXXVI
4002,LXXVI,"And for St. Andrew's town, with eager speed,"
4003,LXXVI,"Where was the king with all his family,"
4004,LXXVI,"And where the single fight, in listed mead,"
4005,LXXVI,"Upon his daughter's quarrel, was to be,"
4006,LXXVI,"The good Rinaldo pricked, nor spared his steed,"
4007,LXXVI,"Until, within an easy distance, he"
4008,LXXVI,"Now near the city, met a squire who brought"
4009,LXXVI,More recent tidings than the damsel taught:
4010,LXXVI,
4011,LXXVII,LXXVII
4012,LXXVII,"That thither had repaired a stranger knight,"
4013,LXXVII,"To combat in Geneura's quarrel bent,"
4014,LXXVII,"With ensigns strange, not known of living wight,"
4015,LXXVII,Since ever close concealed the warrior went;
4016,LXXVII,"Not, since he had been there, had bared to sight"
4017,LXXVII,"His visage, aye within his helmet pent:"
4018,LXXVII,"And that the very squire who with him came,"
4019,LXXVII,Swore that he knew not what the stranger's name.
4020,LXXVII,
4021,LXXVIII,LXXVIII
4022,LXXVIII,"Not far they ride before the walls appear,"
4023,LXXVIII,And now before the gate their coursers stand.
4024,LXXVIII,"To advance the sad Dalinda was in fear,"
4025,LXXVIII,"Yet followed, trusting in Rinaldo's brand."
4026,LXXVIII,"The gate was shut, and to the porter near,"
4027,LXXVIII,What this implies Rinaldo makes demand:
4028,LXXVIII,"To him was said, the people, one and all,"
4029,LXXVIII,Were trooped to see a fight without the wall:
4030,LXXVIII,
4031,LXXIX,LXXIX
4032,LXXIX,"Beyond the city, fought upon accord,"
4033,LXXIX,Between Lurcanio and a stranger knight;
4034,LXXIX,"Where, on a spacious meadow's level sward,"
4035,LXXIX,The pair already had begun the fight.
4036,LXXIX,"The porter opened to Mount Alban's lord,"
4037,LXXIX,And straight behind the peer the portal hight.
4038,LXXIX,"Rinaldo through the empty city rode,"
4039,LXXIX,But in a hostel first the dame bestowed:
4040,LXXIX,
4041,LXXX,LXXX
4042,LXXX,And will that she (he will not long delay
4043,LXXX,To seek her there) till his return repose;
4044,LXXX,"And quickly to the lists pursued his way,"
4045,LXXX,"Where the two made that fell exchange of blows,"
4046,LXXX,And strove and struggled yet in bloody fray.
4047,LXXX,Lurcanio's heart with vengeful hatred glows
4048,LXXX,Against Geneura; while that other knight
4049,LXXX,As well maintains the quarrel for her right.
4050,LXXX,
4051,LXXXI,LXXXI
4052,LXXXI,Six knights on foot within the palisade
4053,LXXXI,Stand covered with the corslet's iron case;
4054,LXXXI,"Beneath the Duke of Albany arrayed,"
4055,LXXXI,Borne on a puissant steed of noble race:
4056,LXXXI,"Who there, as lord high-constable obeyed,"
4057,LXXXI,"Was keeper of the field and of the place,"
4058,LXXXI,And joyed Geneura's peril to espy
4059,LXXXI,With swelling bosom and exulting eye.
4060,LXXXI,
4061,LXXXII,LXXXII
4062,LXXXII,"Rinaldo pierces through the parted swarm,"
4063,LXXXII,"(So wide is felt the good Bayardo's sway,)"
4064,LXXXII,"And he who hears the courser come in storm,"
4065,LXXXII,"Halts not, in his desire to make him way:"
4066,LXXXII,"Above is seen Rinaldo's lofty form,"
4067,LXXXII,The flower of those who mix in martial fray.
4068,LXXXII,"He stops his horse before the monarch's chair,"
4069,LXXXII,While all to hear the paladin repair.
4070,LXXXII,
4071,LXXXIII,LXXXIII
4072,LXXXIII,"""Dread sir,"" to him the good Rinaldo said,"
4073,LXXXIII,"""Let not the pair this combat longer ply;"
4074,LXXXIII,"Since whichsoever of the two falls dead,"
4075,LXXXIII,"Know, that you let him perish wrongfully:"
4076,LXXXIII,"This thinks that he is right, and is misled,"
4077,LXXXIII,"Vouches the false, and knows not 'tis a lie:"
4078,LXXXIII,"Since that which brought his brother to his end,"
4079,LXXXIII,Moves him in causeless battle contend.
4080,LXXXIII,
4081,LXXXIV,LXXXIV
4082,LXXXIV,"""That, in pure gentleness, with little care"
4083,LXXXIV,"If what he here maintains be wrong or right,"
4084,LXXXIV,"Because he would preserve a maid so fair,"
4085,LXXXIV,Perils his person in the furious fight.
4086,LXXXIV,"To injured innocence I safety bear,"
4087,LXXXIV,And to the evil man its opposite.
4088,LXXXIV,"But first, for love of God, the battle stay;"
4089,LXXXIV,"Then list, sir king, to what I shall display."""
4090,LXXXIV,
4091,LXXXV,LXXXV
4092,LXXXV,So moved the king the grave authority
4093,LXXXV,"Of one who seemed so worthy, by his cheer,"
4094,LXXXV,That he made sign the battle should not be
4095,LXXXV,Further continued then with sword or spear:
4096,LXXXV,"To whom, together with his chivalry,"
4097,LXXXV,And barons of the realm and others near
4098,LXXXV,"Rinaldo all the treacherous plot displayed,"
4099,LXXXV,Which Polinesso for Geneura layed.
4100,LXXXV,
4101,LXXXVI,LXXXVI
4102,LXXXVI,Next that he there in arms would testify
4103,LXXXVI,"The truth of what he vouched, the warrior cried."
4104,LXXXVI,"False Polinesso, called, with troubled eye,"
4105,LXXXVI,"Stood forth, but daringly the tale denied."
4106,LXXXVI,To him the good Rinaldo in reply;
4107,LXXXVI,"""By deeds be now the doubtful quarrel tried."""
4108,LXXXVI,"The field was cleared, and, ready armed, the foes,"
4109,LXXXVI,"Without more let, in deadly duel close."
4110,LXXXVI,
4111,LXXXVII,LXXXVII
4112,LXXXVII,"How was the hope to king and people dear,"
4113,LXXXVII,The proof might show Geneura innocent!
4114,LXXXVII,"All trust that God will make the treason clear,"
4115,LXXXVII,And show she was accused with foul intent:
4116,LXXXVII,"For Polinesso, greedy and severe,"
4117,LXXXVII,"And proud was held, and false and fraudulent."
4118,LXXXVII,"So that none there, of all assembled, deemed"
4119,LXXXVII,"It marvel, if the knight such fraud had schemed."
4120,LXXXVII,
4121,LXXXVIII,LXXXVIII
4122,LXXXVIII,"False Polinesso, with a mien distressed,"
4123,LXXXVIII,"A pallid cheek, and heart which thickly beat,"
4124,LXXXVIII,"At the third trumpet, laid his lance in rest;"
4125,LXXXVIII,"As well Rinaldo spurred the knight to meet,"
4126,LXXXVIII,"And levelled at his evil foeman's breast,"
4127,LXXXVIII,Eager to finish at a single heat.
4128,LXXXVIII,Nor counter to his wish was the event;
4129,LXXXVIII,Since through the warrior half his weapon went.
4130,LXXXVIII,
4131,LXXXIX,LXXXIX
4132,LXXXIX,"Him, through his breast, impaled upon the spear,"
4133,LXXXIX,More than six yards beyond his horse he bore.
4134,LXXXIX,"With speed alighted Mount Albano's peer,"
4135,LXXXIX,"And, ere he rose, unlaced the helm he wore:"
4136,LXXXIX,"But he for mercy prayed with humble cheer,"
4137,LXXXIX,Unfit to strive in joust or warfare more:
4138,LXXXIX,"And, before king and court, with faltering breath,"
4139,LXXXIX,Confessed the fraud which brought him to his death.
4140,LXXXIX,
4141,XC,XC
4142,XC,"He brings not his confession to a close,"

4146,XC,"With more delight and rapture overflows,"

4340,XVII,All Europe's region he had left behind
4341,XVII,"In his swift course; and, issuing in that part,"

4370,XX,"Than that, where, wheeling wide, the courser furled"
4371,XX,"His spreading wings, and lighted on the ground,"

4390,XXII,"These, fearless of the hunter's dart or snare,"
4391,XXII,"Feed at their ease, or ruminating lie:"

4405,XXIV,XXIV
4406,XXIV,"And there, close-by where rose a bubbling fount,"
4407,XXIV,"Begirt the fertile palm and cedar-tree,"
4408,XXIV,"He drops the shield, the helmet from his front"
4409,XXIV,"Uplifts, and, either hand from gauntlet free,"
4410,XXIV,"Now turning to the beach, and now the mount,"
4411,XXIV,"Catches the gales which blow from hill or sea,"

4417,XXV,"Now dabbles in the crystal wave, to chase"
4418,XXV,"The scorching heat which rages in his veins,"
4419,XXV,Caught from the heavy corslet's burning case.
4420,XXV,Nor is it marvel if the burden pains;
4421,XXV,No ramble his in square or market-place!
4422,XXV,"Three thousand miles, without repose, he went,"
4423,XXV,"And still, at speed, in ponderous armour pent."

4426,XXVI,"Meanwhile the courser by the myrtle's side,"
4427,XXVI,"Whom he left stabled in the cool retreat,"
4428,XXVI,"Started at something in the wood descried,"
4429,XXVI,Scared by I know not what; and in his heat
4430,XXVI,"So made the myrtle shake where he was tied,"
4431,XXVI,He brought a shower of leaves about his feet;
4432,XXVI,"He made the myrtle shake and foliage fall,"
4433,XXVI,"But, struggling, could not loose himself withal."
4434,XXVI,
4435,XXVII,XXVII
4436,XXVII,"As in a stick to feed the chimney rent,"
4437,XXVII,"Where scanty pith ill fills the narrow sheath,"

4442,XXVII,"So the offended myrtle inly pined,"
4443,XXVII,"Groaned, murmured, and at last unclosed its rind:"
4444,XXVII,
4445,XXVIII,XXVIII
4446,XXVIII,"And hence a clear, intelligible speech"

4458,XXIX,"Stands, when he finds it issues from the tree;"
4459,XXIX,And swiftly to remove the courser hies.
4460,XXIX,"Then, with a face suffused with crimson, he"
4461,XXIX,"In answer to the groaning myrtle, cries;"
4462,XXIX,"""Pardon! and, whatsoe'er thou art, be good,"

4470,XXX,"But not the less for that, to me reply,"

4481,XXXI,"The service done with praise and grateful heart."""
4482,XXXI,"Rogero said; and, as he closed his suit,"
4483,XXXI,That gentle myrtle shook from top to root.

4485,XXXII,XXXII
4486,XXXII,"Next drops were seen to stand upon the bark,"
4487,XXXII,"As juice is sweated by the sapling-spray,"
4488,XXXII,"New-severed, when it yields to flame and spark,"
4489,XXXII,Sometime in vain kept back and held at bay.
4490,XXXII,"And next the voice began:  ""My story dark,"
4491,XXXII,"Forced by thy courteous deed, I shall display; --"
4492,XXXII,"What once I was -- by whom, through magic lore,"
4493,XXXII,Changed to a myrtle on the pleasant shore.

4501,XXXIII,"After my royal father, Otho hight."
4502,XXXIII,"More dames than one my beauty served to warm,"

4510,XXXIV,"Thence, rescued by illustrious Brava's pride,"
4511,XXXIV,"Whose prowess freed us from that dark retreat,"
4512,XXXIV,"Westward I fared along the sandy shores,"

4796,LXIII,"The captain of this crew, which blocked the road,"
4797,LXIII,"Appeared, with monstrous paunch and bloated face;"
4798,LXIII,"Who a slow tortoise for a horse bestrode,"
4799,LXIII,That passing sluggishly with him did pace:
4800,LXIII,"Down looked, some here, some there, sustained the load,"
4801,LXIII,"For he was drunk, and kept him in his place."
4802,LXIII,"Some wipe his brows and chin from sweat which ran,"

4806,LXIV,"One, with a human shape and feet, his crest,"
4807,LXIV,"Fashioned like hound, in neck and ears and head,"
4808,LXIV,"Bayed at the gallant Child with angry quest,"
4809,LXIV,To turn him to the city whence he fled.
4810,LXIV,"""That will I never, while of strength possessed"
4811,LXIV,"To brandish this,"" the good Rogero said:"
4812,LXIV,"With that his trenchant faulchion he displayed,"

4816,LXV,"That monster would have smote him with a spear,"
4817,LXV,"But swiftly at his foe Rogero sprung,"
4818,LXV,"Thrust at his paunch, and drove his faulchion sheer"
4819,LXV,Through his pierced back a palm; his buckler flung
4820,LXV,"Before him, and next sallied there and here:"
4821,LXV,But all too numerous was the wicked throng.
4822,LXV,"Now grappled from behind, now punched before,"
4823,LXV,"He stands, and plies the crowd with warfare sore."
4824,LXV,
4825,LXVI,LXVI
4826,LXVI,"One to the teeth, another to the breast,"
4827,LXVI,Of that foul race he cleft; since no one steeled
4828,LXVI,"In mail, his brows with covering helmet dressed,"
4829,LXVI,"Or fought, secured by corslet or by shield;"
4830,LXVI,"Yet is he so upon all quarters pressed,"
4831,LXVI,"That it would need the Child, to clear the field,"
4832,LXVI,"And to keep off the wicked crew which swarms,"
4833,LXVI,More than Briareus' hundred hands and arms.
4834,LXVI,
4835,LXVII,LXVII
4836,LXVII,"If he had thought the magic shield to show,"

4839,LXVII,Left at his saddle by the wizard Moor)
4840,LXVII,"That hideous band, in sudden overthrow,"
4841,LXVII,"Blinded by this, had sunk the knight before."

4846,LXVIII,"This as it may: the Child would meet his fate,"
4847,LXVIII,Ere by so vile a band be prisoner led;
4848,LXVIII,"When, lo!  forth issuing from the city's gate,"
4849,LXVIII,"Whose wall appeared like shining gold I said,"
4850,LXVIII,"Two youthful dames, not born in low estate,"
4851,LXVIII,"If measured by their mien and garb, nor bred"
4852,LXVIII,"By swain, in early wants and troubles versed;"
4853,LXVIII,But amid princely joys in palace nursed!

4855,LXIX,LXIX
4856,LXIX,"On unicorn was seated either fair,"
4857,LXIX,A beast than spotless ermine yet more white;

4859,LXIX,"Their garb, and with such graceful fashion dight,"
4860,LXIX,"That he who closely viewed the youthful pair,"
4861,LXIX,"Would need a surer sense than mortal sight,"
4862,LXIX,To judge between the two.  With such a mien
4863,LXIX,Embodied Grace and Beauty would be seen.
4864,LXIX,
4865,LXX,LXX
4866,LXX,"Into the mead rode this and the other dame,"
4867,LXX,Where the foul crew opposed the Child's retreat.
4868,LXX,"The rabble scattered as the ladies came,"
4869,LXX,Who with extended hand the warrior greet.
4870,LXX,"He, with a kindling visage, red with shame,"
4871,LXX,Thanked the two damsels for their gentle feat;
4872,LXX,"And was content upon their will to wait,"
4873,LXX,With them returning to that golden gate.

4875,LXXI,LXXI
4876,LXXI,"Above, a cornice round the gateway goes,"
4877,LXXI,"Somedeal projecting from the colonnade,"
4878,LXXI,"In which is not a single part but glows,"
4879,LXXI,With rarest gems of India overlaid.
4880,LXXI,"Propp'd at four points, the portal did repose"
4881,LXXI,On columns of one solid diamond made.
4882,LXXI,"Whether what met the eye was false or true,"
4883,LXXI,Was never sight more fair or glad to view.

4885,LXXII,LXXII
4886,LXXII,"Upon the sill and through the columns there,"

4889,LXXII,Had they observed a woman's fitting port.
4890,LXXII,"All are arrayed in green, and garlands wear"
4891,LXXII,"Of the fresh leaf.  Him these in courteous sort,"
4892,LXXII,"With many proffers and fair mien entice,"
4893,LXXII,And welcome to this opening Paradise:
4894,LXXII,
4895,LXXIII,LXXIII
4896,LXXIII,"For so with reason I this place may call,"
4897,LXXIII,"Where, it is my belief, that Love had birth;"
4898,LXXIII,"Where life is spent in festive game and ball,"
4899,LXXIII,And still the passing moments fleet in mirth.
4900,LXXIII,"Here hoary-headed Thought ne'er comes at all,"
4901,LXXIII,"Nor finds a place in any bosom.  Dearth,"
4902,LXXIII,"Nor yet Discomfort, never enter here,"
4903,LXXIII,Where Plenty fills her horn throughout the year.
4904,LXXIII,
4905,LXXIV,LXXIV
4906,LXXIV,"Here, where with jovial and unclouded brow,"
4907,LXXIV,"Glad April seems to wear a constant smile,"
4908,LXXIV,"Troop boys and damsels: One, whose fountains flow,"
4909,LXXIV,On the green margin sings in dulcet style;
4910,LXXIV,"Others, the hill or tufted tree below,"
4911,LXXIV,"In dance, or no mean sport the hours beguile."
4912,LXXIV,"While this, who shuns the revellers' noisy cheer,"

4916,LXXV,"Above the laurel and pine-tree's height,"

4919,LXXV,"These, at their conquests made, rejoiced and gay:"
4920,LXXV,"These, with the well-directed shaft, take sight"
4921,LXXV,"At hearts, and those spread nets to catch their prey;"

4929,LXXVI,"Broidered with gold, and jewels bright to view."
4930,LXXVI,"That other winged horse, which, at his need,"
4931,LXXVI,"Obedient to the Moorish wizard flew,"
4932,LXXVI,"The friendly damsels to a youth consigned,"
4933,LXXVI,Who led him at a slower pace behind.

4939,LXXVII,"When he the road had taken on his right,"

5221,XXIII,"The guests their bodies reverently incline,"
5222,XXIII,And to their bowers depart the courtly crew.
5223,XXIII,"He upon perfumed sheets, whose texture fine"
5224,XXIII,"Seemed of Arachne's loom, his body threw:"
5225,XXIII,"Hearkening this while with still attentive ears,"
5226,XXIII,If he the coming of the lady hears.
5227,XXIII,
5228,XXIV,XXIV
5229,XXIV,"At every movement heard on distant floor,"
5230,XXIV,"Hoping 'twas her, Rogero raised his head:"
5231,XXIV,"He thinks he hears; but it is heard no more,"
5232,XXIV,Then sighs at his mistake: ofttimes from bed
5233,XXIV,"He issued, and undid his chamber door,"
5234,XXIV,"And peeped abroad, but still no better sped;"
5235,XXIV,And cursed a thousand times the hour that she
5236,XXIV,So long retarded his felicity.
5237,XXIV,
5238,XXV,XXV
5239,XXV,"""Yes, now she comes,"" the stripling often said,"
5240,XXV,"And reckoned up the paces, as he lay,"
5241,XXV,Which from her bower where haply to be made
5242,XXV,To that where he was waiting for the fay.
5243,XXV,"These thoughts, and other thoughts as vain, he weighed"
5244,XXV,"Before she came, and restless at her stay,"
5245,XXV,"Often believed some hinderance, yet unscanned,"
5246,XXV,Might interpose between the fruit and hand.
5247,XXV,
5248,XXVI,XXVI
5249,XXVI,"At length, when dropping sweets the costly fay"
5250,XXVI,"Had put some end to her perfumery,"
5251,XXVI,"The time now come she need no more delay,"
5252,XXVI,"Since all was hushed within the palace, she"
5253,XXVI,"Stole from her bower alone, through secret way,"
5254,XXVI,"And passed towards the chamber silently,"
5255,XXVI,Where on his couch the youthful cavalier
5256,XXVI,"Lay, with a heart long torn by Hope and Fear."
5257,XXVI,
5258,XXVII,XXVII
5259,XXVII,When the successor of Astolpho spies
5260,XXVII,"Those smiling stars above him, at the sight"
5261,XXVII,"A flame, like that of kindled sulphur, flies"
5262,XXVII,"Through his full veins, as ravished by delight"
5263,XXVII,Out of himself; and now up to the eyes
5264,XXVII,"Plunged in a sea of bliss, he swims outright."
5265,XXVII,"He leaps from bed and folds her to his breast,"
5266,XXVII,Nor waits until the lady he undressed;
5267,XXVII,
5268,XXVIII,XXVIII
5269,XXVIII,"Though but in a light sendal clad, that she"
5270,XXVIII,Wore in the place of farthingale or gown;
5271,XXVIII,"Which o'er a shift of finest quality,"
5272,XXVIII,"And white, about her limbs the fay had thrown:"
5273,XXVIII,"The mantle yielded at his touch, as he"
5274,XXVIII,"Embraced her, and that veil remained alone,"
5275,XXVIII,"Which upon every side the damsel shows,"
5276,XXVIII,More than clear glass the lily or the rose.
5277,XXVIII,
5278,XXIX,XXIX
5279,XXIX,"The plant no closer does the ivy clip,"
5280,XXIX,With whose green boughs its stem is interlaced.
5281,XXIX,"Than those fond lovers, each from either's lip"
5282,XXIX,"The balmy breath collecting, he embraced:"
5283,XXIX,"Rich perfume this, whose like no seed or slip"
5284,XXIX,Bears in sweet Indian or Sabacan waste;
5285,XXIX,"While so to speak their joys is either fixed,"
5286,XXIX,That oftentimes those meeting lips are mixed.
5287,XXIX,
5288,XXX,XXX
5289,XXX,These things were carried closely by the dame
5290,XXX,"And youth, or if surmised, were never bruited;"
5291,XXX,"For silence seldom was a cause for blame,"
5292,XXX,But oftener as a virtue well reputed.
5293,XXX,"By those shrewd courtiers, conscious of his claim,"
5294,XXX,Rogero is with proffers fair saluted:
5295,XXX,"Worshipped of all those inmates, who fulfil"
5296,XXX,"In this the enamoured far, Alcina's will."
5297,XXX,
5298,XXXI,XXXI
5299,XXXI,No pleasure is omitted there; since they
5300,XXXI,Alike are prisoners in Love's magic hall.
5301,XXXI,"They change their raiment twice or thrice a day,"
5302,XXXI,"Now for this use, and now at other call."
5303,XXXI,"'Tis often feast, and always holiday;"
5304,XXXI,"'Tis wrestling, tourney, pageant, bath, and ball."
5305,XXXI,"Now underneath a hill by fountain cast,"
5306,XXXI,They read the amorous lays of ages past:
5307,XXXI,
5308,XXXII,XXXII
5309,XXXII,"Now by glad hill, or through the shady dale,"
5310,XXXII,"They hunt the fearful hare, and now they flush"
5311,XXXII,"With busy dog, sagacious of the trail,"
5312,XXXII,Wild pheasant from the stubble-field or bush.
5313,XXXII,"Now where green junipers perfume the gale,"
5314,XXXII,"Suspend the snare, or lime the fluttering thrush:"
5315,XXXII,"And casting now for fish, with net or book,"
5316,XXXII,Disturb their secret haunts in pleasant brook.
5317,XXXII,
5318,XXXIII,XXXIII
5319,XXXIII,"Rogero revels there, in like delight,"
5320,XXXIII,While Charles and Agramant are troubled sore.
5321,XXXIII,"But not for him their story will I slight,"
5322,XXXIII,"Nor Bradamant forget: who evermore,"
5323,XXXIII,"Mid toilsome pain and care, her cherished knight,"
5324,XXXIII,"Ravished from her, did many a day deplore;"
5325,XXXIII,"Whom by unwonted ways, transported through"
5326,XXXIII,"Mid air, the damsel saw, nor whither knew."
5327,XXXIII,
5328,XXXIV,XXXIV
5329,XXXIV,"Of her I speak before the royal pair,"
5330,XXXIV,Who many days pursued her search in vain;
5331,XXXIV,"By shadowy wood, or over champaign bare,"
5332,XXXIV,"By farm and city, and by hill and plain;"
5333,XXXIV,"But seeks her cherished friend with fruitless care,"
5334,XXXIV,Divided by such space of land and main:
5335,XXXIV,"Often she goes among the Paynim spears,"
5336,XXXIV,Yet never aught of her Rogero hears.
5337,XXXIV,
5338,XXXV,XXXV
5339,XXXV,"Of hundreds questioned, upon every side,"
5340,XXXV,"Each day, no answer ever gives content."
5341,XXXV,"She roams from post to post, and far and wide"
5342,XXXV,"Searches pavilion, lodging, booth, or rent,"
5343,XXXV,"And this, mid foot or horsemen, unespied,"
5344,XXXV,"May safely do, without impediment,"
5345,XXXV,"Thanks to the ring, whose more than mortal aid,"
5346,XXXV,"When in her mouth, conceals the vanished maid."
5347,XXXV,
5348,XXXVI,XXXVI
5349,XXXVI,"She cannot, will not, think that he is dead;"
5350,XXXVI,Because the wreck of such a noble knight
5351,XXXVI,"Would, from Hydaspes' distant waves have spread,"
5352,XXXVI,To where the sun descends with westering light.
5353,XXXVI,"She knows not what to think, nor whither sped,"
5354,XXXVI,"He roams in earth or air; yet, hapless wight,"
5355,XXXVI,"Him ever seeks, and for attendant train"
5356,XXXVI,"Has sobs and sighs, and every bitter pain."
5357,XXXVI,
5358,XXXVII,XXXVII
5359,XXXVII,"At length to find the wondrous cave she thought,"
5360,XXXVII,"Where the prophetic homes of Merlin lie,"
5361,XXXVII,And there lament herself until she wrought
5362,XXXVII,Upon the pitying marble to reply;
5363,XXXVII,"For thence, if yet he lived would she be taught,"
5364,XXXVII,Of this glad life to hard necessity
5365,XXXVII,"Had yielded up; and, when she was possessed"
5366,XXXVII,"Of the seer's councils, would pursue the best."
5367,XXXVII,
5368,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
5369,XXXVIII,"With this intention, Bradamant her way"
5370,XXXVIII,"Directed thither, where in Poictier's wood"
5371,XXXVIII,"The vocal tomb, containing Merlin's clay,"
5372,XXXVIII,"Concealed in Alpine place and savage, stood."
5373,XXXVIII,"But that enchantress sage, who night and day"
5374,XXXVIII,"Thought of the damsel, watchful for her good,"
5375,XXXVIII,"She, I repeat, who taught her what should be"
5376,XXXVIII,In that fair grotto her posterity;
5377,XXXVIII,
5378,XXXIX,XXXIX
5379,XXXIX,"She who preserved her with protecting care,"
5380,XXXIX,"That same enchantress, still benign and wise,"
5381,XXXIX,"Who, knowing she a matchless race should bear"
5382,XXXIX,"Of men, or rather semi-deities,"
5383,XXXIX,"Spies daily what her thoughts and actions are,"
5384,XXXIX,"And lots for her each day, divining, tries; --"
5385,XXXIX,"She all Rogero's fortune knew, how freed;"
5386,XXXIX,Then borne to India by the griffin steed:
5387,XXXIX,
5388,XL,XL
5389,XL,"Him on that courser plainly she had eyed,"
5390,XL,Who would not the controlling rein obey;
5391,XL,"When, severed by such interval, he hied,"
5392,XL,"Borne through the perilous, unwonted way:"
5393,XL,"And knew that he sport, dance, and banquet plied,"
5394,XL,And lapt in idleness and pleasure lay;
5395,XL,"Nor memory of his lord nor of the dame,"
5396,XL,"Once loved so well, preserved, not of his fame."
5397,XL,
5398,XLI,XLI
5399,XLI,And thus such gentle knight ingloriously
5400,XLI,"Would have consumed his fairest years and best,"
5401,XLI,"In long inaction, afterwards to be,"
5402,XLI,"Body and soul, destroyed; and that, possessed"
5403,XLI,Alone by us in perpetuity.
5404,XLI,"That flower, whose sweets outlive the fragile rest"
5405,XLI,"Which quickens man when he in earth is laid,"
5406,XLI,Would have been plucked or severed in the blade.
5407,XLI,
5408,XLII,XLII
5409,XLII,"But that enchantress kind, who with more care"
5410,XLII,"Than for himself he watched, still kept the knight,"
5411,XLII,"Designed to drag him, by rough road and bare,"
5412,XLII,"Towards true virtue, in his own despite;"
5413,XLII,As often cunning leech will burn and pare
5414,XLII,"The flesh, and poisonous drug employ aright:"
5415,XLII,"Who, though at first his cruel art offend,"
5416,XLII,"Is thanked, since he preserves us in the end."
5417,XLII,
5418,XLIII,XLIII
5419,XLIII,"She, not like old Atlantes, rendered blind"
5420,XLIII,"By the great love she to the stripling bore,"
5421,XLIII,"Set not on gifting him with life her mind,"
5422,XLIII,As was the scope of that enchanter hoar;
5423,XLIII,"Who, reckless all of fame and praise declined,"
5424,XLIII,Wished length of days to his Rogero more
5425,XLIII,"Than that, to win a world's applause, the peer"
5426,XLIII,Should of his joyous life forego one year.
5427,XLIII,
5428,XLIV,XLIV
5429,XLIV,By him he to Alcina's isle had been
5430,XLIV,"Dispatched, that in her palace he might dwell,"
5431,XLIV,"Forgetting arms; and, as enchanter seen"
5432,XLIV,"In magic and the use of every spell,"
5433,XLIV,"The heart had fastened of that fairy-queen,"
5434,XLIV,"Enamoured of the gentle youth, so well,"
5435,XLIV,"That she the knot would never disengage,"
5436,XLIV,Though he should live to more than Nestor's age.

5438,XLV,XLV
5439,XLV,Returning now to her that well foreknew
5440,XLV,"Whatever was to come to pass, I say"
5441,XLV,"She thither did her journey straight pursue,"
5442,XLV,Where she met Aymon's daughter by the way
5443,XLV,Forlorn and wandering: Bradamant at view
5444,XLV,"Of her enchantress, erst to grief a prey,"
5445,XLV,Changes it all to hope: the other tells
5446,XLV,That with Alcina her Rogero dwells.
5447,XLV,
5448,XLVI,XLVI
5449,XLVI,"Nigh dead the maid remains, in piteous guise,"
5450,XLVI,"Hearing of him so far removed, and more"
5451,XLVI,"Grieves that she danger to her love descries,"
5452,XLVI,Save this some strong and speedy cure restore.
5453,XLVI,"But her the enchantress comforts, and applies"
5454,XLVI,"A salve where it was needed most, and swore"
5455,XLVI,That few short days should pass before anew
5456,XLVI,Rogero should return to glad her view.
5457,XLVI,
5458,XLVII,XLVII
5459,XLVII,"""Since thou, an antidote to sorcery,"
5460,XLVII,"Lady (she said), the virtuous ring dost wear,"

5462,XLVII,"This, where thine every good is hidden, hear,"
5463,XLVII,"To foil Alcina's wiles and witchery,"
5464,XLVII,And thence to bring thee back thy cherished care.
5465,XLVII,"This evening, early, will I hence away,"
5466,XLVII,"And be in India by the break of day."""
5467,XLVII,

5470,XLVIII,"The mode which she was purposing to employ,"
5471,XLVIII,"From that effeminate, soft realm to bring"
5472,XLVIII,Back into warlike France the cherished boy.
5473,XLVIII,"Bradamant from her finger slipt the ring,"
5474,XLVIII,Nor this alone would have bestowed with joy;
5475,XLVIII,"But heart and life would at her feet have laid,"
5476,XLVIII,If she had deemed they could Rogero aid.
5477,XLVIII,
5478,XLIX,XLIX
5479,XLIX,"Giving the ring, her cause she recommends"
5480,XLIX,"To her, and recommends Rogero more."
5481,XLIX,"Countless salutes by her the damsel sends,"
5482,XLIX,"Then of Provence, departing seeks the shore."
5483,XLIX,The enchantress to another quarter wends;
5484,XLIX,"And, for the execution of her lore,"
5485,XLIX,"Conjures, that eve, a palfrey, by her art,"
5486,XLIX,"With one foot red, black every other part."
5487,XLIX,
5488,L,L
5489,L,"Some Farfarello, or Alchino he,"

5492,L,"Ungirt and barefoot, mounted in the sell."
5493,L,"But, with wise caution, from her finger she"
5494,L,"Withdrew the ring, lest it should mar the spell:"

5496,L,She in Alcina's isle arrived at morn.
5497,L,
5498,LI,LI
5499,LI,"Herself she changed with wonderful disguise,"
5500,LI,Adding a palm of stature to her height;

5503,LI,"As was she deemed, the necromancer wise,"
5504,LI,Who with such care had reared the youthful knight.
5505,LI,"With long-descending beard she clothed her chin,"

5508,LII,LII
5509,LII,"To imitate his speech, and face, and cheer,"
5510,LII,"She knew so well, that, by the youth descried,"

5512,LII,"Next hid, and watched so long, that she espied"
5513,LII,Upon a day (rare chance) the cavalier
5514,LII,At length detached from his Alcina's side:
5515,LII,"For still, in motion or at rest, the fay"
5516,LII,Ill bore the youth should be an hour away.
5517,LII,
5518,LIII,LIII
5519,LIII,"Alone she finds him, fitting well her will,"

5522,LIII,Streaming towards a limpid lake and fair.
5523,LIII,"His fine, soft garments, wove with cunning skill,"
5524,LIII,"All over, ease and wantonness declare;"

5646,LXV,"Buried in earth, unseen of any eye."
5647,LXV,
5648,LXVI,LXVI
5649,LXVI,"So speaking, to the natural shape she wore"
5650,LXVI,Before his eyes returned the magic dame;
5651,LXVI,"Nor old Atlantes' form was needed more,"
5652,LXVI,The good effect obtained for which she came.
5653,LXVI,"To tell you that which was not told before,"
5654,LXVI,Melissa was the sage enchantress' name:
5655,LXVI,"Who to Rogero now her purpose said,"
5656,LXVI,And told with what design she thither sped:
5657,LXVI,
5658,LXVII,LXVII
5659,LXVII,"Dispatched by her, who him in anxious pain"
5660,LXVII,"Desires, nor longer can without him be,"
5661,LXVII,With the intent to loose him from the chain
5662,LXVII,Wherewith he was begirt by sorcery;
5663,LXVII,"And had put on, more credence to obtain,"
5664,LXVII,"Atlantes de Carena's form; but she,"
5665,LXVII,"Seeing his health restored, now willed the youth,"
5666,LXVII,Through her should hear and see the very truth.
5667,LXVII,
5668,LXVIII,LXVIII
5669,LXVIII,"""That gentle lady who so loves thee, who"
5670,LXVIII,Were well deserving love upon thy part;
5671,LXVIII,"To whom (unless forgot, thou know'st how true"
5672,LXVIII,"The tale) thou debtor for thy freedom art,"
5673,LXVIII,"This ring, which can each magic spell undo,"
5674,LXVIII,"Sends for thy succour, and would send her heart,"
5675,LXVIII,"If with such virtue fraught, her heart could bring"
5676,LXVIII,"Thee safely in thy perils, like the ring."""
5677,LXVIII,
5678,LXIX,LXIX
5679,LXIX,"How Bradamant had loved, and loves, she says,"
5680,LXIX,Continuing to Rogero her relation;
5681,LXIX,"To this, her worth commends with fitting praise,"
5682,LXIX,Tempering in truth and fondness her narration;
5683,LXIX,"And still employs the choicest mode and phrase,"
5684,LXIX,"Which fits one skilful in negociation,"
5685,LXIX,"And on the false Alcina brings such hate,"
5686,LXIX,As on things horrible is wont to wait;
5687,LXIX,
5688,LXX,LXX
5689,LXX,Brings hate on that which he so loved before;
5690,LXX,"Nor let the tale astonish which you hear,"
5691,LXX,"For since his love was forced by magic lore,"
5692,LXX,The ring the false enchantment served to clear.
5693,LXX,"This too unmasked the charms Alcina wore,"
5694,LXX,"And made all false, from head to food, appear."
5695,LXX,"None of her own, but borrowed, all he sees,"
5696,LXX,And the once sparkling cup now drugged with lees.
5697,LXX,
5698,LXXI,LXXI
5699,LXXI,"Like boy who somewhere his ripe fruit bestows,"
5700,LXXI,"And next forgets the place where it is laid,"
5701,LXXI,"Then, after many days, conducted goes"
5702,LXXI,"By chance, where he the rich deposit made,"
5703,LXXI,"And wonders that the hidden treasure shows,"
5704,LXXI,"Not what it is, but rotten and decayed;"
5705,LXXI,"And hates, and scorns, and loathes, with altered eyes,"
5706,LXXI,And throws away what he was used to prize.
5707,LXXI,
5708,LXXII,LXXII
5709,LXXII,"Rogero thus, when by Melissa's lore"
5710,LXXII,"Advised, he to behold the fay returned,"
5711,LXXII,"And that good ring of sovereign virtue wore,"
5712,LXXII,"Which, on the finger placed, all spells o'erturned;"
5713,LXXII,"For that fair damsel he had left before,"
5714,LXXII,"To his surprise, so foul a dame discerned,"
5715,LXXII,"That in this ample world, examined round,"
5716,LXXII,A hag so old and hideous is not found.
5717,LXXII,
5718,LXXIII,LXXIII
5719,LXXIII,"Pale, lean, and wrinkled was the face, and white,"
5720,LXXIII,And thinly clothed with hair Alcina's head;
5721,LXXIII,"Her stature reached not to six palms in height,"
5722,LXXIII,And every tooth was gone; for she had led
5723,LXXIII,"A longer life than ever mortal wight,"
5724,LXXIII,Than Hecuba or she in Cuma bred;
5725,LXXIII,"But thus by practice, to our age unknown,"
5726,LXXIII,Appeared with youth and beauty not her own.
5727,LXXIII,
5728,LXXIV,LXXIV
5729,LXXIV,"By art she gave herself the lovely look,"
5730,LXXIV,Which had on many like Rogero wrought;
5731,LXXIV,"But now the ring interpreted the book,"
5732,LXXIV,"Which secrets, hid for many ages, taught."
5733,LXXIV,"No wonder then that he the dame forsook,"
5734,LXXIV,And banished from his mind all further thought
5735,LXXIV,"Of love for false Alcina, found in guise"
5736,LXXIV,Which no new means of slippery fraud supplies.
5737,LXXIV,
5738,LXXV,LXXV
5739,LXXV,"But, as Melissa counselled him, he wore"
5740,LXXV,"His wonted semblance for a time, till he"
5741,LXXV,"Was with his armour, many days before"
5742,LXXV,"Laid by, again accoutred cap-a-pee."
5743,LXXV,"And, lest Alcina should his end explore,"
5744,LXXV,Feigned to make proof of his agility;
5745,LXXV,Feigned to make proof if for his arms he were
5746,LXXV,"Too gross, long time unwont the mail to bear."
5747,LXXV,
5748,LXXVI,LXXVI
5749,LXXVI,Next Balisarda to his flank he tied
5750,LXXVI,"(For so Rogero's trenchant sword was hight),"
5751,LXXVI,"And took the wondrous buckler, which, espied,"
5752,LXXVI,"Not only dazzled the beholder's sight,"
5753,LXXVI,"But seemed, when its silk veil was drawn aside,"
5754,LXXVI,As from the body if exhaled the sprite:
5755,LXXVI,"In its close cover of red sendal hung,"
5756,LXXVI,This at his neck the youthful warrior slung.
5757,LXXVI,
5758,LXXVII,LXXVII
5759,LXXVII,"Provided thus, he to the stables came,"
5760,LXXVII,And bade with bridle and with saddle dight
5761,LXXVII,A horse more black than pitch; for so the dame
5762,LXXVII,"Counselled, well-taught how swift the steed and light."
5763,LXXVII,"Him Rabicano those who know him name,"
5764,LXXVII,"And he the courser was, that with the knight,"
5765,LXXVII,"Who stands beside the sea, the breeze's sport,"
5766,LXXVII,The whale of yore conducted to that port.
5767,LXXVII,
5768,LXXVIII,LXXVIII
5769,LXXVIII,"The hippogryph he might have had at need,"
5770,LXXVIII,"Who next below good Rabican was tied,"
5771,LXXVIII,"But that the dame had cried to him, ""Take heed,"
5772,LXXVIII,"Thou know'st how ill that courser is to ride"";"
5773,LXXVIII,And said the following day the winged steed
5774,LXXVIII,"'Twas her intention from that realm to guide,"
5775,LXXVIII,"Where he should be instructed at his leisure,"
5776,LXXVIII,To rein and run him every where at pleasure:
5777,LXXVIII,
5778,LXXIX,LXXIX
5779,LXXIX,"Nor, if he took him not, would he suggest"
5780,LXXIX,Suspicion of the intended flight: The peer
5781,LXXIX,"This while performed Melissa's every hest,"
5782,LXXIX,"Who, still invisible, was at his ear."
5783,LXXIX,"So feigning, from the wanton dome possessed"
5784,LXXIX,"By that old strumpet, rode the cavalier;"
5785,LXXIX,"And pricking forth drew near unto a gate,"
5786,LXXIX,Whence the road led to Logistilla's state.

5831,II,
5832,III,III
5833,III,"Rogero, still dissembling, as I said,"

5851,IV,
5852,V,V
5853,V,"Towards him came the knave, with semblance haught,"
5854,V,Demanding whither in such haste he sped:

5856,V,"He hence assured more clearly that he fled,"
5857,V,"Within himself to stop the warrior thought,"
5858,V,"And thus, with his left arm extended, said:"
5859,V,"""What, if I suddenly thy purpose balk,"
5860,V,"And thou find no defence against this hawk?"""
5861,V,
5862,VI,VI
5863,VI,"Then flies his bird, who works so well his wing,"
5864,VI,Rabican cannot distance him in flight:
5865,VI,"The falconer from his back to ground did spring,"
5866,VI,And freed him from the bit which held him tight;
5867,VI,"Who seemed an arrow parted from the string,"
5868,VI,"And terrible to foe, with kick and bite;"
5869,VI,"While with such haste behind the servant came,"
5870,VI,"He sped as moved by wind, or rather flame."
5871,VI,
5872,VII,VII
5873,VII,Nor will the falconer's dog appear more slow;
5874,VII,"But hunts Rogero's courser, as in chace"
5875,VII,Of timid hare the pard is wont to go.
5876,VII,"Not to stand fast the warrior deems disgrace,"
5877,VII,"And turns towards the swiftly-footed foe,"
5878,VII,"Whom he sees wield a riding-wand, place"
5879,VII,"Of other arms, to make his dog obey."
5880,VII,Rogero scorns his faulchion to display.
5881,VII,
5882,VIII,VIII
5883,VIII,"The servant made at him, and smote him sore;"
5884,VIII,The dog his left foot worried; while untied
5885,VIII,"From rein, the lightened horse three times and more"
5886,VIII,"Lashed from the croup, nor missed his better side."
5887,VIII,"The hawk, oft wheeling, with her talons tore"
5888,VIII,"The stripling, and his horse so terrified,"
5889,VIII,"The courser, by the whizzing sound dismayed,"
5890,VIII,Little the guiding hand or spur obeyed.
5891,VIII,
5892,IX,IX
5893,IX,"Constrained at length, his sword Rogero drew"
5894,IX,"To clear the rabble, who his course delay;"
5895,IX,And in the animals' or villain's view
5896,IX,"Did now its point, and now its edge display."
5897,IX,But with more hinderance and vexatious crew
5898,IX,"Swarm here and there, and wholly block the way;"
5899,IX,"And that dishonour will ensue and loss,"
5900,IX,"Rogero sees, if him they longer cross."
5901,IX,
5902,X,X
5903,X,"He knew each little that he longer stayed,"
5904,X,Would bring the fay and followers on the trail;
5905,X,"Already drums were beat, and trumpets brayed,"
5906,X,And larum-bells rang loud in every vale.
5907,X,An act too foul it seemed to use his blade
5908,X,"On dog, and knave unfenced with arms or mail:"
5909,X,A better and shorter way it were
5910,X,"The buckler, old Atlantes' work, to bare."
5911,X,
5912,XI,XI
5913,XI,He raised the crimson cloth in which he wore
5914,XI,"The wondrous shield, enclosed for many a day;"
5915,XI,"Its beams, as proved a thousand times before,"
5916,XI,"Work as they wont, when on the sight they play;"
5917,XI,Senseless the falconer tumbles on the moor;
5918,XI,"Drop dog and hackney; drop the pinions gay,"
5919,XI,Which poised in air the bird no longer keep:
5920,XI,Then glad Rogero leaves a prey to sleep.
5921,XI,
5922,XII,XII
5923,XII,"In the mean time, Alcina, who had heard"
5924,XII,"How he had forced the gate, and, in the press,"
5925,XII,"Slaughtered a mighty number of her guard,"
5926,XII,"Remained nigh dead, o'erwhelmed with her distress;"
5927,XII,"She tore her vesture, and her visage marred,"
5928,XII,And cursed her want of wit and wariness.
5929,XII,"Then made forthwith her meiny sound to arms,"
5930,XII,And round herself arrayed her martial swarms.
5931,XII,
5932,XIII,XIII
5933,XIII,"Divided next, one squadron by the way"
5934,XIII,"Rogero took, she sent; the bands were two:"
5935,XIII,"She at the port embarked the next array,"
5936,XIII,And straight to sea dispatched the warlike crew.
5937,XIII,"With this good squadron went the desperate fay,"
5938,XIII,And darked by loosened sails the billows grew;
5939,XIII,"For so desire upon her bosom preyed,"
5940,XIII,Of troops she left her city unpurveyed.
5941,XIII,
5942,XIV,XIV
5943,XIV,"Without a guard she left her palace there,"
5944,XIV,"Which to Melissa, prompt her time to seize,"
5945,XIV,"To loose her vassals that in misery were,"
5946,XIV,Afforded all convenience and full ease;
5947,XIV,"-- To range, at leisure, through the palace fair,"
5948,XIV,And so examine all her witcheries;
5949,XIV,"To raze the seal, burn images, and loose"
5950,XIV,"Or cancel hag-knot, rhomb, or magic noose."
5951,XIV,
5952,XV,XV
5953,XV,"Thence, through the fields, fast hurrying from that dome,"
5954,XV,"The former lovers changed, a mighty train,"
5955,XV,"Some into rock or tree, to fountain some,"
5956,XV,"Or beast, she made assume their shapes again:"
5957,XV,"And these, when they anew are free to roam,"
5958,XV,Follow Rogero's footsteps to the reign
5959,XV,Of Logistilla's sage; and from that bourn
5960,XV,"To Scythia, Persia, Greece, and Ind return."
5961,XV,
5962,XVI,XVI
5963,XVI,"They to their several homes dispatched, repair,"
5964,XVI,Bound by a debt which never can be paid:
5965,XVI,"The English duke, above the rest her care,"
5966,XVI,"Of these, was first in human form arrayed:"
5967,XVI,For much his kindred and the courteous prayer
5968,XVI,Of good Rogero with Melissa weighed.
5969,XVI,"Beside his prayers, the ring Rogero gave;"
5970,XVI,That him she by its aid might better save.
5971,XVI,
5972,XVII,XVII
5973,XVII,"Thus by Rogero's suit the enchantress won,"
5974,XVII,To his first shape transformed the youthful peer;
5975,XVII,But good Melissa deemed that nought was done
5976,XVII,"Save she restored his armour, and that spear"
5977,XVII,"Of gold, which whensoe'er at tilt he run,"
5978,XVII,At the first touch unseated cavalier;
5979,XVII,"Once Argalia's, next Astolpho's lance,"
5980,XVII,And source of mighty fame to both in France.
5981,XVII,
5982,XVIII,XVIII
5983,XVIII,"The sage Melissa found this spear of gold,"
5984,XVIII,"Which now Alcina's magic palace graced,"
5985,XVIII,"And other armour of the warrior bold,"
5986,XVIII,Of which he was in that ill dome uncased.
5987,XVIII,"She climbed the courser of the wizard old,"
5988,XVIII,"And on the croup, at ease, Astolpho placed:"
5989,XVIII,"And thus, an hour before Rogero came,"
5990,XVIII,"Repaired to Logistilla, knight and dame."
5991,XVIII,
5992,XIX,XIX
5993,XIX,"Meantime, through rugged rocks, and shagged with thorn,"
5994,XIX,"Rogero wends, to seek the sober fay;"
5995,XIX,"From cliff to cliff, from path to path forlorn,"
5996,XIX,"A rugged, lone, inhospitable way:"
5997,XIX,"Till he, with labour huge oppressed and worn,"
5998,XIX,"Issued at noon upon a beach, that lay"
5999,XIX,"'Twixt sea and mountain, open to the south,"
6000,XIX,"Deserted, barren, bare, and parched with drouth."

6002,XX,XX
6003,XX,The sunbeams on the neighbouring mountain beat
6004,XX,"And glare, reflected from the glowing mass"
6005,XX,"So fiercely, sand and air both boil with heat,"
6006,XX,In mode that might have more than melted glass.
6007,XX,"The birds are silent in their dim retreat,"
6008,XX,"Nor any note is heard in wood or grass,"
6009,XX,"Save the bough perched Cicala's wearying cry,"
6010,XX,"Which deafens hill and dale, and sea and sky."
6011,XX,
6012,XXI,XXI
6013,XXI,The heat and thirst and labour which he bore
6014,XXI,"By that drear sandy way beside the sea,"
6015,XXI,"Along the unhabited and sunny shore,"
6016,XXI,Were to Rogero grievous company:
6017,XXI,"Bur for I may not still pursue this lore,"
6018,XXI,"Nor should you busied with one matter be,"
6019,XXI,"Rogero I abandon in this heat,"
6020,XXI,For Scotland; to pursue Rinaldo's beat.
6021,XXI,
6022,XXII,XXII
6023,XXII,"By king, by daughter, and by all degrees,"
6024,XXII,To Sir Rinaldo was large welcome paid;
6025,XXII,"And next the warrior, at his better ease,"
6026,XXII,The occasion of his embassy displayed:
6027,XXII,"That he from thence and England, subsidies"
6028,XXII,"Of men was seeking, for his monarch's aid,"
6029,XXII,"In Charles's name; and added, in his care,"
6030,XXII,The justest reasons to support his prayer.
6031,XXII,
6032,XXIII,XXIII
6033,XXIII,"The king made answer, that `without delay,"
6034,XXIII,"Taxed to the utmost of his powers and might,"
6035,XXIII,"His means at Charlemagne's disposal lay,"
6036,XXIII,For the honour of the empire and the right.
6037,XXIII,"And that, within few days, he in array"
6038,XXIII,"Such horsemen, as he had in arms, would dight;"
6039,XXIII,"And, save that he was now waxed old, would lead"
6040,XXIII,The expedition he was prayed to speed.
6041,XXIII,
6042,XXIV,XXIV
6043,XXIV,`Nor like consideration would appear
6044,XXIV,"Worthy to stop him, but that he possessed"
6045,XXIV,"A son, and for such charge that cavalier,"
6046,XXIV,"Measured by wit and force, was worthiest."
6047,XXIV,"Though not within the kingdom was the peer,"
6048,XXIV,It was his hope (as he assured his guest)
6049,XXIV,"He would, while yet preparing was the band,"
6050,XXIV,"Return, and find it mustered to his hand.'"
6051,XXIV,
6052,XXV,XXV
6053,XXV,"So sent through all his realm, with expedition,"
6054,XXV,"His treasures, to levy men and steeds;"
6055,XXV,"And ships prepared, and warlike ammunition,"
6056,XXV,"And money, stores and victual for their needs."
6057,XXV,"Meantime the good Rinaldo on his mission,"
6058,XXV,"Leaving the courteous king, to England speeds;"
6059,XXV,"He brought him on his way to Berwick's town,"
6060,XXV,And was observed to weep when he was gone.
6061,XXV,
6062,XXVI,XXVI
6063,XXVI,The wind sat in the poop; Rinaldo good
6064,XXVI,Embarked and bade farewell to all; the sheet
6065,XXVI,"Still loosening to the breeze, the skipper stood,"
6066,XXVI,"Till where Thames' waters, waxing bitter, meet"
6067,XXVI,"Salt ocean: wafted thence by tide of flood,"
6068,XXVI,"Through a sure channel to fair London's seat,"
6069,XXVI,"Safely the mariners their course explore,"
6070,XXVI,"Making their way, with aid of sail and oar."
6071,XXVI,
6072,XXVII,XXVII
6073,XXVII,"The Emperor Charles, and he, King Otho grave,"
6074,XXVII,"Who was with Charles, by siege in Paris pressed,"
6075,XXVII,"A broad commission to Rinaldo brave,"
6076,XXVII,"With letters to the Prince of Wales addressed,"
6077,XXVII,"And countersigns had given, dispatched to crave"
6078,XXVII,What foot and horse were by the land possessed.
6079,XXVII,The whole to be to Calais' port conveyed;
6080,XXVII,That it to France and Charles might furnish aid.
6081,XXVII,
6082,XXVIII,XXVIII
6083,XXVIII,"The prince I speak of, who on Otho's throne"
6084,XXVIII,"Sate in his stead, the vacant helm to guide,"
6085,XXVIII,"Such honor did to Aymon's valiant son,"
6086,XXVIII,He not with such his king had gratified.
6087,XXVIII,"Next, all to good Rinaldo's wish, was done:"
6088,XXVIII,"Since for his martial bands on every side,"
6089,XXVIII,"In Britain, or the isles which round her lay,"
6090,XXVIII,To assemble near the sea he fixed a day.
6091,XXVIII,
6092,XXIX,XXIX
6093,XXIX,"But here, sir, it behoves me shift my ground,"
6094,XXIX,"Like him that makes the sprightly viol ring,"
6095,XXIX,"Who often changes chord and varies sound,"
6096,XXIX,"And now a graver strikes, now sharper string:"
6097,XXIX,Thus I: -- who did to good Rinaldo bound
6098,XXIX,"My tale, Angelica remembering;"
6099,XXIX,"Late left, where saved from him by hasty flight,"
6100,XXIX,She had encountered with an anchorite.
6101,XXIX,
6102,XXX,XXX
6103,XXX,Awhile I will pursue her story: I
6104,XXX,"Told how the maid of him with earnest care,"
6105,XXX,"Enquired, how she towards the shore might fly:"
6106,XXX,"Who of the loathed Rinaldo has such fear,"
6107,XXX,"She dreads, unless she pass the sea, to die,"
6108,XXX,"As insecure in Europe, far or near,"
6109,XXX,"But she was by the hermit kept in play,"
6110,XXX,Because he pleasure took with her to stay.
6111,XXX,
6112,XXXI,XXXI
6113,XXXI,"His heart with love of that rare beauty glowed,"
6114,XXXI,And to his frozen marrow pierced the heat;
6115,XXXI,"Who, after, when he saw that she bestowed"
6116,XXXI,"Small care on him, and thought but of retreat,"
6117,XXXI,His sluggish courser stung with many a goad;
6118,XXXI,But with no better speed he plied his feet.
6119,XXXI,"Ill was his walk, and worse his trot; nor spur"
6120,XXXI,Could that dull beast to quicker motion stir:
6121,XXXI,
6122,XXXII,XXXII
6123,XXXII,"And for the flying maid was far before,"
6124,XXXII,"And he would soon have ceased to track her steed,"
6125,XXXII,"To the dark cave recurred the hermit hoar,"
6126,XXXII,And conjured up of fiends a grisly breed:
6127,XXXII,"One he selected out of many more,"
6128,XXXII,And first informed the demon of his need;
6129,XXXII,"Then in the palfrey bade him play his part,"
6130,XXXII,Who with the lady bore away his heart:
6131,XXXII,
6132,XXXIII,XXXIII
6133,XXXIII,And as sagacious dog on mountain tried
6134,XXXIII,"Before, accustomed fox and hare to chase,"
6135,XXXIII,"If he behold the quarry choose one side,"
6136,XXXIII,"The other takes, and seems to slight the trace:"
6137,XXXIII,"But at the turn arriving, is espied,"
6138,XXXIII,Already tearing what he crossed to face;
6139,XXXIII,So her the hermit by a different road
6140,XXXIII,"Will meet, wherever she her palfrey goad."
6141,XXXIII,
6142,XXXIV,XXXIV
6143,XXXIV,What was the friar's design I well surmise;
6144,XXXIV,And you shall know; but in another page.
6145,XXXIV,"Angelica now slow, now faster, flies,"
6146,XXXIV,"Nought fearing this: while conjured by the sage,"
6147,XXXIV,The demon covered in the courser lies;
6148,XXXIV,As fire sometimes will hide its smothered rage:
6149,XXXIV,"Then blazes with devouring flame and heat,"
6150,XXXIV,"Unquenchable, and scarce allows retreat."
6151,XXXIV,
6152,XXXV,XXXV
6153,XXXV,After the flying maid had shaped her course
6154,XXXV,"By the great sea which laves the Gascon shore,"
6155,XXXV,"Still keeping to the rippling waves her horse,"
6156,XXXV,"Where best the moistened sand the palfrey bore,"
6157,XXXV,"Him, plunged into the brine, the fiend perforce"
6158,XXXV,"Dragged, till he swam amid the watery roar."
6159,XXXV,"Nor what to do the timid damsel knew,"
6160,XXXV,Save that she closer to her saddle grew.
6161,XXXV,
6162,XXXVI,XXXVI
6163,XXXVI,"She cannot, howsoe'er the rein she ply,"
6164,XXXVI,"Govern the horse, who swims the surge to meet:"
6165,XXXVI,Her raiment she collects and holds it high;
6166,XXXVI,"And, not to wet them, gathers up her feet."
6167,XXXVI,"Her tresses, which the breeze still wantonly"
6168,XXXVI,"Assaults, dishevelled on her shoulders beat."
6169,XXXVI,"The louder winds are hushed, perchance in duty,"
6170,XXXVI,"Intent, like ocean, on such sovereign beauty."
6171,XXXVI,
6172,XXXVII,XXXVII
6173,XXXVII,Landward in vain her eyes the damsel bright
6174,XXXVII,"Directs, which water face and breast with tears,"
6175,XXXVII,"And ever sees, decreasing to her sight,"
6176,XXXVII,"The beach she left, which less and less appears."
6177,XXXVII,"The courser, who was swimming to the right,"
6178,XXXVII,"After a mighty sweep, the lady bears"
6179,XXXVII,"To shore, where rock and cavern shag the brink,"
6180,XXXVII,As night upon the land begins to sink.
6181,XXXVII,
6182,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
6183,XXXVIII,"When in that desert, which but to descry"
6184,XXXVIII,"Bred fear in the beholder, stood the maid"
6185,XXXVIII,"Alone, as Phoebus, plunged in ocean, sky"
6186,XXXVIII,And nether earth had left obscured in shade;
6187,XXXVIII,"She paused in guise, which in uncertainty"
6188,XXXVIII,"Might leave whoever had the form surveyed,"
6189,XXXVIII,"If she were real woman, or some mock"
6190,XXXVIII,"Resemblance, coloured in the living rock."
6191,XXXVIII,
6192,XXXIX,XXXIX
6193,XXXIX,"She, fixed and stupid in her wretchedness,"
6194,XXXIX,"Stood on the shifting sand, with ruffled hair:"
6195,XXXIX,"Her hands were joined, her lips were motionless,"
6196,XXXIX,"Her languid eyes upturned, as in despair,"
6197,XXXIX,"Accusing Him on high, that to distress"
6198,XXXIX,"And whelm her, all the fates united were."
6199,XXXIX,Astound she stood awhile; when grief found vent
6200,XXXIX,"Through eyes and tongue, in tears and in lament."

6227,XLII,"No thanks to heaven for such a gift are due,"
6228,XLII,Whence on my head does every mischief fall.
6229,XLII,For this my brother Argalia died;

6519,LXXII,That in his escort even from Catay

6521,LXXII,There lost: Of whom he had discerned no token

6531,LXXIII,To have let them place thee in old Namus' hand!

7361,LXIV,"If in the knight's disposal, and the say"

7363,LXIV,Hence thirty men dispatched by other way

7370,LXV,"The knight with words, till horse and foot he spied"
7371,LXV,"Arrived, where he this ambuscade did lay;"
7372,LXV,When from the gate he with as many hied:
7373,LXV,"As is the practised hunter's wonted way,"
7374,LXV,To circle wood and beasts on every side:
7375,LXV,"As nigh Volana, with his sweeping nets,"
7376,LXV,The wary fisher fish and pool besets.
7377,LXV,
7378,LXVI,LXVI
7379,LXVI,'Tis thus the king bars every path which lies
7380,LXVI,"Free for the warrior's flight, with armed train:"

7382,LXVI,"Would have, and lightly hopes his end to gain;"
7383,LXVI,"Nor for the earthly thunderbolt applies,"
7384,LXVI,That had so many and so many slain:
7385,LXVI,"Which here he deems would serve his purpose ill,"
7386,LXVI,Where he desires to take and not to kill.
7387,LXVI,
7388,LXVII,LXVII
7389,LXVII,"As wary fowler, bent on greater prey,"
7390,LXVII,"Wisely preserves alive the game first caught,"
7391,LXVII,"That by the call-bird and his cheating play,"
7392,LXVII,More may within the circling net be brought;
7393,LXVII,Such cunning art Cymosco would assay:
7394,LXVII,But Roland would not be so lightly bought;
7395,LXVII,Like them by the first toil that springs betrayed;
7396,LXVII,And quickly forced the circle which was made.
7397,LXVII,
7398,LXVIII,LXVIII
7399,LXVIII,"Where he perceives the assailants thickest stand,"

7402,LXVIII,"Another, and another, who appear"
7403,LXVIII,Of paste; till six he of the circling band
7404,LXVIII,Of foes impales upon a single spear;
7405,LXVIII,"A seventh left out, who by the push is slain,"
7406,LXVIII,Since the clogged weapon can no more contain.
7407,LXVIII,
7408,LXIX,LXIX
7409,LXIX,"No otherwise, upon the further shore"
7410,LXIX,"Of fosse or of canal, the frogs we spy,"
7411,LXIX,"By cautious archer, practised in his lore,"
7412,LXIX,Smote and transfixed the one the other nigh;
7413,LXIX,"Upon the shaft, until it hold no more,"
7414,LXIX,"From barb to feathers full, allowed to lie."
7415,LXIX,"The heavy lance Orlando from him flung,"
7416,LXIX,And to close combat with his faulchion sprung.
7417,LXIX,
7418,LXX,LXX
7419,LXX,"The lance now broke, his sword the warrior drew,"
7420,LXX,"That sword which never yet was drawn in vain,"
7421,LXX,And still with cut or thrust some soldier slew;
7422,LXX,"Now horse, now footman of the tyrant's train."
7423,LXX,"And, ever where he dealt a stroke, changed blue,"
7424,LXX,"Yellow, green, white and black, to crimson stain."

7426,LXX,Not to have now his hollow cane and fire;
7427,LXX,
7428,LXXI,LXXI
7429,LXXI,And with loud voice and menacing command
7430,LXXI,"Bids these be brought, but ill his followers hear;"
7431,LXXI,"For those who have found safety of his band,"
7432,LXXI,To issue from the city are in fear.
7433,LXXI,"He, when he sees them fly on either hand,"
7434,LXXI,Would fly as well from that dread cavalier;
7435,LXXI,"Makes for the gate, and would the drawbridge lift,"

7437,LXXI,
7438,LXXII,LXXII
7439,LXXII,"The monarch turns his back, and leaves the knight"
7440,LXXII,Lord of the drawbridge and of either gate.
7441,LXXII,"Thanks to his swifter steed, the rest in flight"
7442,LXXII,He passes: good Orlando will not wait
7443,LXXII,"(Intent the felon, not his band, to smite)"
7444,LXXII,Upon the vulgar herd to wreck his hate.
7445,LXXII,"But his slow horse seems restive; while the king's,"
7446,LXXII,"More nimble, flies as if equipt with wings."
7447,LXXII,
7448,LXXIII,LXXIII
7449,LXXIII,"From street to street, before the count he made;"

7452,LXXIII,"Which, at his hest, this while his men convey."
7453,LXXIII,"And posted at a corner, he waylaid:"
7454,LXXIII,"His foe, as hunter watches for his prey,"
7455,LXXIII,"In forest, with armed dogs and spear, attending"
7456,LXXIII,"The boar in fury from the hill descending,"
7457,LXXIII,
7458,LXXIV,LXXIV
7459,LXXIV,Who rends the branch and overthrows the stone;
7460,LXXIV,"And wheresoe'er he turns his haughty front,"
7461,LXXIV,Appears (so loud the deafening crash and groan)
7462,LXXIV,"As if he were uprending wood and mount,"
7463,LXXIV,"Intent to make him his bold deed atone,"
7464,LXXIV,Cymosco at the pass expects the count;
7465,LXXIV,"As soon as he appears, with ready light"
7466,LXXIV,"Touches the hole, and fires upon the knight."
7467,LXXIV,
7468,LXXV,LXXV
7469,LXXV,"Behind, the weapon flames in lightning's guise,"
7470,LXXV,And vents the thunder from before; the ground
7471,LXXV,Shakes under foot and city wall; the skies
7472,LXXV,The fearful echo all about rebound.
7473,LXXV,"The burning bolt with sudden fury flies,"
7474,LXXV,Not sparing aught which in its course is found.
7475,LXXV,Hissing and whizzing through the skies it went;
7476,LXXV,"But smote not, to the assassin's foul intent."
7477,LXXV,
7478,LXXVI,LXXVI
7479,LXXVI,Whether it was his great desire to kill
7480,LXXVI,"That baron, or his hurry made him fail,"
7481,LXXVI,"Or trembling heart, like leaf which flutters still,"
7482,LXXVI,Made hand and arm together flinch and quail;
7483,LXXVI,Or that it was not the Creator's will
7484,LXXVI,The church so soon her champion should bewail;
7485,LXXVI,"The glancing stroke his courser's belly tore,"
7486,LXXVI,"Outstretched on earth, from thence to rise no more."
7487,LXXVI,
7488,LXXVII,LXXVII
7489,LXXVII,To earth fall horse and rider: this the knight
7490,LXXVII,Scarce touched; the other thundering pressed the plain:
7491,LXXVII,"For the first rose so ready and so light,"
7492,LXXVII,He from the fall seemed breath and force to gain.
7493,LXXVII,"As African Anteus, in the fight,"
7494,LXXVII,Rose from the sand with prouder might and main;
7495,LXXVII,"So when Orlando touched the ground, to view"
7496,LXXVII,He rose with doubled force and vigour new.

7498,LXXVIII,LXXVIII
7499,LXXVIII,"He who has seen the thunder, from on high,"
7500,LXXVIII,"Discharged by Jove with such a horrid sound,"
7501,LXXVIII,"Descend where nitre, coal, and sulphur lie,"
7502,LXXVIII,"Stored up for use in magazine profound,"
7503,LXXVIII,"Which scarce has reached -- but touched it, ere the sky"
7504,LXXVIII,"Is in a flame, as well as burning ground,"
7505,LXXVIII,"Firm walls are split, and solid marbles riven,"
7506,LXXVIII,And flying stones cast up as high as heaven;
7507,LXXVIII,
7508,LXXIX,LXXIX
7509,LXXIX,"Let him imagine, when from earth he sprung,"
7510,LXXIX,Such was the semblance of the cavalier;
7511,LXXIX,Who moved in mode to frighten Mars among
7512,LXXIX,"The Gods, so fierce and horrid was his cheer."
7513,LXXIX,"At this dismay'd, the King of Friesland stung"
7514,LXXIX,"His horse, and turned his rein, to fly the peer:"
7515,LXXIX,But fierce Orlando was upon his foe

7522,LXXX,"Exceeds all credence, save in those who view."

7524,LXXX,"Smote at his head so well, he cleft it through;"

7532,LXXXI,Followed Bireno's cousin from his lands:
7533,LXXXI,"Who, since the unguarded gates he open found,"
7534,LXXXI,Into the city's heart had poured his bands;
7535,LXXXI,"Where the bold paladin had struck such fear,"
7536,LXXXI,He without let might scour it far and near.
7537,LXXXI,
7538,LXXXII,LXXXII

7542,LXXXII,"As Zealand-men distinguishes the band,"
7543,LXXXII,"Carte blanche they proffer, and the chief address,"
7544,LXXXII,Bidding him range them under his command;
7545,LXXXII,"Against the Frieslanders to lend him aid,"

7547,LXXXII,
7548,LXXXIII,LXXXIII
7549,LXXXIII,To Friesland's king that people hatred bore
7550,LXXXIII,With all his following: who their ancient lord

7552,LXXXIII,"As evil and rapacious, was abhorred."
7553,LXXXIII,"Orlando interposed with kindly lore,"

7560,LXXXIV,"But breaking-down the gate, their entrance made;"
7561,LXXXIV,Bireno to the count with courtesy
7562,LXXXIV,And grateful thanks the service done repaid.
7563,LXXXIV,"Thence they, together with large company,"
7564,LXXXIV,Went where Olympia in her vessel stayed:
7565,LXXXIV,"For so was the expecting lady hight,"

7573,LXXXV,"Her, full of love and loyal homage, sought"
7574,LXXXV,The people one and all:  Twere long to tell
7575,LXXXV,"How she caressed Bireno, he the maid, --"
7576,LXXXV,What thanks both lovers to the county paid.
7577,LXXXV,
7578,LXXXVI,LXXXVI
7579,LXXXVI,"The people, throned in her paternal reign,"
7580,LXXXVI,"Replace the injured dame, and fealty swear:"

7582,LXXXVI,"Love with eternal knot had linked the fair,"
7583,LXXXVI,The empire of herself and her domain
7584,LXXXVI,"Conferred: He, called away by other care,"
7585,LXXXVI,Left in the cousin's guardian care this while
7586,LXXXVI,"His fortresses, and all the subject isle."
7587,LXXXVI,
7588,LXXXVII,LXXXVII
7589,LXXXVII,"Since he to visit Zealand's duchy planned,"
7590,LXXXVII,His faithful consort in his company;
7591,LXXXVII,"And thence, upon the king of Friesland's land,"
7592,LXXXVII,"Would try his fortune (as he said), for he"
7593,LXXXVII,"A pledge, he rated highly, had in hand,"
7594,LXXXVII,"Which seemed of fair success the warranty,"
7595,LXXXVII,"The daughter of the king: who here forsaken,"

7601,LXXXVIII,The Roman senator thence parting wends
7602,LXXXVIII,Upon the very day Bireno weighed;
7603,LXXXVIII,But he to nothing else his hand extends
7604,LXXXVIII,"Of all the many, many prized made,"
7605,LXXXVIII,"Save to that engine, found amid the plunder,"
7606,LXXXVIII,Which in all points I said resembled thunder.

7609,LXXXIX,"Not with intent, in his defence to bear"

7611,LXXXIX,For he still held it an ungenerous care
7612,LXXXIX,To go with vantage on whatever quest:
7613,LXXXIX,But with design to cast the weapon where
7614,LXXXIX,It never more should living wight molest;
7615,LXXXIX,"And, what was appertaining to it, all"

7774,X,Of the proud king who ruled the Friesland state;
7775,X,"That with Bireno's brother was to wed,"
7776,X,As far as rumour tells; but to relate
7777,X,"The truth, a longing in Bireno bred"
7778,X,The sight of food so passing delicate;
7779,X,"And he to talk his palate deemed would be,"
7780,X,"For other's sake, a foolish courtesy."

7783,XI,"The gentle damsel had not past fourteen,"
7784,XI,"Was beautiful and fresh, and like a rose,"
7785,XI,"When this first opening from its bud is seen,"
7786,XI,And with the vernal sun expands and grows.
7787,XI,To say Bireno loved the youthful queen
7788,XI,"Were little; with less blaze lit tinder glows,"
7789,XI,"Or ripened corn, wherever envious hand"
7790,XI,"Of foe amid the grain has cast a brand,"
7791,XI,
7792,XII,XII
7793,XII,"Than that which on Bireno's bosom fed,"
7794,XII,"And to his marrow burned; when, weeping sore"
7795,XII,"The fate of her unhappy father dead,"
7796,XII,He saw her bathed in ceaseless tears deplore:
7797,XII,"And, as cold water, on the cauldron shed,"
7798,XII,"Shops short the bubbling wave, which boiled before;"
7799,XII,So was the raging rife Olympia blew
7800,XII,"Within his breast, extinguished by a new."
7801,XII,
7802,XIII,XIII
7803,XIII,Nor feels Bireno mere satiety;
7804,XIII,"He loathes her so, he ill endures her sight;"
7805,XIII,"And, if his hope he long deferred, will die:"
7806,XIII,For other such his fickle appetite!
7807,XIII,Yet till the day prefixed to satisfy
7808,XIII,"His fond desire, so feigns the wary knight,"
7809,XIII,Olympia less to love than to adore
7810,XIII,"He seems, and but her pleasure to explore."
7811,XIII,
7812,XIV,XIV
7813,XIV,"And if the other he too much caress,"
7814,XIV,"Who cannot but caress her, there are none"
7815,XIV,"See evil in the deed, but rather guess"
7816,XIV,"It is in pity, is in goodness done:"
7817,XIV,Since to raise up and comfort in distress
7818,XIV,"Whom Fortune's wheel beats down in changeful run,"
7819,XIV,Was never blamed; with glory oftener paid;
7820,XIV,"-- So much the more, a young -- a harmless maid."

7822,XV,XV
7823,XV,Almighty God!  how fallible and vain
7824,XV,"Is human judgment, dimmed by clouds obscure!"
7825,XV,"Bireno's actions, impious and profane,"
7826,XV,By others are reputed just and pure.
7827,XV,"Already stooping to their oars, the train"
7828,XV,"Have loosed his vessel from the port secure,"
7829,XV,And with the duke and his companions steer
7830,XV,"For Zealand through the deep, with meery cheer."
7831,XV,
7832,XVI,XVI
7833,XVI,Already Holland and its headlands all
7834,XVI,"Are left astern, and now descried no more;"
7835,XVI,Since to shun Friesland they to larboard hawl.
7836,XVI,And keep their course more nigh the Scottish shore:
7837,XVI,"When they are overtaken by a squall,"
7838,XVI,And drive three days the open sea before:
7839,XVI,"Upon the third, when now, near eventide,"
7840,XVI,A barren and unpeopled isle is spied.
7841,XVI,
7842,XVII,XVII
7843,XVII,"As soon as they were harboured in a hight,"
7844,XVII,Olympia landed and the board was spread;
7845,XVII,"She there contented, with the faithless knight,"
7846,XVII,"Supt, unsuspecting any cause for dread."
7847,XVII,"Thence, with Bireno, where a tent was pight"
7848,XVII,"In pleasant place, repaired, and went to bed."

7852,XVIII,XVIII
7853,XVIII,"The fear and late sea sorrow, which had weighed"
7854,XVIII,"So long upon the dame and broke her rest,"
7855,XVIII,The finding herself safe in greenwood shade
7856,XVIII,"Removed from noise, and, for her tranquil breast"
7857,XVIII,(Knowing her lover was beside her laid)
7858,XVIII,"No further thoughts, no further cares molest,"
7859,XVIII,"Olympia lap in slumber so profound,"
7860,XVIII,No sheltered bear or dormouse sleeps more sound.
7861,XVIII,
7862,XIX,XIX
7863,XIX,"The lover false, who, hatching treason lies,"
7864,XIX,"Stole from his bed in silence, when he knew"
7865,XIX,"She slept: his clothes he in a bundle ties,"
7866,XIX,Nor other raiment on his body threw.
7867,XIX,"Then issuing forth from the pavilion hies,"
7868,XIX,"As if on new-born wings, towards his crew;"
7869,XIX,"Who, roused, unmoor without a cry, as he"
7870,XIX,"Commands, and loosen thence and put to sea."
7871,XIX,
7872,XX,XX
7873,XX,Behind the land was left; and there to pine
7874,XX,"Olympia, who yet slept the woods among;"
7875,XX,Till from her gilded wheels the frosty rhine
7876,XX,Aurora upon earth beneath had flung;
7877,XX,"And the old woe, beside the tumbling brine,"
7878,XX,"Lamenting, halcyons mournful descant sung;"
7879,XX,"When she, 'twixt sleep and waking, made a strain"
7880,XX,"To reach her loved Bireno, but in vain."
7881,XX,
7882,XXI,XXI
7883,XXI,She no one found: the dame her arm withdrew;
7884,XXI,"She tried again, yet no one found; she spread"
7885,XXI,"Both arms, now here, now there, and sought anew;"
7886,XXI,Now either leg; but yet no better sped.
7887,XXI,Fear banished sleep; she oped her eyes: in view
7888,XXI,Was nothing: she no more her widowed bed
7889,XXI,"Would keep, but from the couch in fury sprung,"
7890,XXI,And headlong forth from the pavilion flung.
7891,XXI,
7892,XXII,XXII
7893,XXII,"And seaward ran, her visage tearing sore,"
7894,XXII,"Presaging, and now certain of her plight:"
7895,XXII,"She beat her bosom, and her tresses tore,"
7896,XXII,And looked (the moon was shining) if she might
7897,XXII,Discover any thing beside the shore;
7898,XXII,"Nor, save the shore, was any thing in sight."
7899,XXII,"She calls Bireno, and the caverns round,"
7900,XXII,"Pitying her grief, Bireno's name rebound."
7901,XXII,
7902,XXIII,XXIII
7903,XXIII,On the far shore there rose a rock; below
7904,XXIII,Scooped by the breaker's beating frequently:
7905,XXIII,"The cliff was hollowed underneath, in show"
7906,XXIII,"Of arch, and overhung the foaming sea."
7907,XXIII,Olympia (MIND such vigour did bestow)
7908,XXIII,"Sprang up the frowning crest impetuously,"
7909,XXIII,"And, at a distance, stretched by favouring gale,"
7910,XXIII,Thence saw her cruel lord's departing sail.
7911,XXIII,
7912,XXIV,XXIV
7913,XXIV,"Saw it, or seemed to see: for ill her eyes,"
7914,XXIV,"Things through the air, yet dim and hazy, view."
7915,XXIV,"She falls, all-trembling, on the ground, and lies"
7916,XXIV,With face than snow more cold and white in hue:
7917,XXIV,"But when she has again found strength to rise,"
7918,XXIV,"Guiding her voice towards the bark which flew,"
7919,XXIV,"Calling with all her might, the unhappy dame"
7920,XXIV,Calls often on her cruel consort's name.
7921,XXIV,
7922,XXV,XXV
7923,XXV,"Where unavailing was the feeble note,"
7924,XXV,She wept and clapt her hands in agony.
7925,XXV,"""Without its freight,"" she cried, ""thy ship does float."
7926,XXV,"-- Where, cruel, dost thou fly so swiftly? -- Me"
7927,XXV,"Receive as well: -- small hinderance to thy boat,"
7928,XXV,"Which bears my spirit, would my body be."""
7929,XXV,"And she her raiment waving in her hand,"
7930,XXV,Signed to the frigate to return to land.
7931,XXV,
7932,XXVI,XXVI
7933,XXVI,"But the loud wind which, sweeping ocean, bears"
7934,XXVI,"The faithless stripling's sail across the deep,"
7935,XXVI,"Bears off as well the shriek, and moan, and prayers"
7936,XXVI,"Of sad Olympia, sorrowing on the steep."
7937,XXVI,"Thrice, cruel to herself, the dame prepares"
7938,XXVI,From the high rock amid the waves to leap.
7939,XXVI,"But from the water lifts at length her sight,"
7940,XXVI,And there returns where she had passed the night.
7941,XXVI,
7942,XXVII,XXVII
7943,XXVII,"Stretched on the bed, upon her face she lay,"
7944,XXVII,"Bathing it with her tears.  ""Last night in thee"
7945,XXVII,"Together two found shelter,"" did she say;"
7946,XXVII,"""Alas!  why two together are not we"
7947,XXVII,At rising?  False Bireno!  cursed day

7953,XXVIII,"""Nor man I see, nor see I work, which shows"
7954,XXVIII,That man inhabits in this isle; nor I
7955,XXVIII,"See ship, in which (a refuge from my woes),"
7956,XXVIII,"Embarking, I from hence may hope to fly."
7957,XXVIII,Here shall I starve; nor any one to close
7958,XXVIII,"My eyes, or give me sepulture, be by,"
7959,XXVIII,"Save wolf perchance, who roves this wood, a tomb"
7960,XXVIII,"Give me, alas!  in his voracious womb."

7967,XXIX,"Can ever cruel beast inflict on me,"
7968,XXIX,"O cruel beast, a fouler death than thou?"
7969,XXIX,Enough for them to slay me once!  while I

8013,XXXIV,"She to the shore's extremest verge anew,"
8014,XXXIV,"Tossing her head, with hair dishevelled, run;"

8016,XXXIV,"Was by ten fiends possessed, instead of one;"
8017,XXXIV,"Of like the frantic Hecuba, at view"

8032,XXXVI,XXXVI
8033,XXXVI,"While to the warrior thirst and labour sore,"

8041,XXXVI,
8042,XXXVII,XXXVII
8043,XXXVII,Reclined on Alexandrian carpets rare
8044,XXXVII,The ladies joyed the cool in great delight;
8045,XXXVII,"About them various wines in vessels were,"
8046,XXXVII,And every sort of comfit nicely dight;
8047,XXXVII,"Fast by, and sporting with the ripple there,"
8048,XXXVII,"Lay, waiting on their needs, a pinnace light,"
8049,XXXVII,Until a breeze should fill her sail anew:

8056,XXXVIII,"His troubled visage, all with sweat besprent,"
8057,XXXVIII,"Began to pray, `on what he had in hand"
8058,XXXVIII,"He would not show his heart so deeply bent,"

8096,XLII,Who weens small fame from such a contest flows;
8097,XLII,"She with her sisters to the frigate hies,"
8098,XLII,"Which waits them, and aboard the tender goes;"

8100,XLII,"Along the sandy beach, still kept in sight."
8101,XLII,
8102,XLIII,XLIII
8103,XLIII,On him with threat and curse she ever cried;

8113,XLIV,"The ferryman put forth the Child to meet,"
8114,XLIV,To bear him to a better shore rejoicing: he

8116,XLIV,If of the heart the face is warranty.
8117,XLIV,"Giving God thanks, Rogero took his seat"
8118,XLIV,"Aboard the bark, and passed the quiet sea,"

8137,XLVI,In this her love from other differs; fear
8138,XLVI,And hope in other on the bosom prey:

8206,LIII,"A word, were fit for action, night or day;"

8208,LIII,"And furious, waged on part of either fay:"
8209,LIII,"Whence was Alcina's realm turned upside down,"
8210,LIII,Of which she had usurped her sister's crown.

8212,LIV,LIV
8213,LIV,Oh!  of how many battles the success
8214,LIV,Is different from what was hoped before!
8215,LIV,"Not only failed the dame to repossess,"
8216,LIV,"As thought, her lover flying from her shore,"
8217,LIV,"But out of ships, even now so numberless,"
8218,LIV,"That ample ocean scarce the navy bore,"
8219,LIV,"From all her vessels, to the flames a prey,"
8220,LIV,But with one bark escaped the wretched fay.

8223,LV,Alcina flies; and her sad troop around
8224,LV,"Routed and taken, burnt or sunk, remains"
8225,LV,"To have lost Rogero, sorrow more profound"
8226,LV,Wakes in her breast than all her other pains;
8227,LV,"And she in bitter tears for ever drowned,"
8228,LV,Of the Child's loss by night and day complains;
8229,LV,"And bent to end her woes, with many a sigh,"
8230,LV,Often laments her that she cannot die.

8232,LVI,LVI
8233,LVI,"No fairy dies, or can, while overhead"
8234,LVI,"The sun shall burn, or heaven preserve their stile,"

8237,LVI,"Fair Dido, she beneath the steel had bled;"
8238,LVI,"Or, haply, like the gorgeous Queen of Nile,"
8239,LVI,In mortal slumber would have closed her eye:
8240,LVI,But fairies cannot at their pleasure die.
8241,LVI,
8242,LVII,LVII
8243,LVII,"Return we, where eternal fame is due,"
8244,LVII,Leaving Alcina in her trouble sore:
8245,LVII,"I speak of valorous Rogero, who"
8246,LVII,Had disembarked upon the safer shore.
8247,LVII,"He turned his back upon the waters blue,"
8248,LVII,Giving God thanks for all with pious lore;
8249,LVII,"And on dry ground now landed, made repair"
8250,LVII,Towards the lofty castle planted there.

8254,LVIII,"Was never yet before of mortal sight,"

8256,LVIII,More rich than carbuncle or diamond bright.
8257,LVIII,"We of like gems discourse not here below,"
8258,LVIII,And he who would their nature read aright

8262,LIX,LIX
8263,LIX,What gives to them superiority
8264,LIX,"O'er every other sort of gem, confessed,"

8287,LXI,"Clustering 'twixt lucid tower or battlement,"
8288,LXI,"Green odoriferous shrubs are seen to grow,"

8298,LXII,"Born with one sun, to live and to decline,"
8299,LXII,"Upon its widowed stalk the blossom dies,"
8300,LXII,Subject to all the changes of the skies.

8307,LXIII,"But that, unneeding any influence lent"
8308,LXIII,"By planet, Logistilla's zeal and care"
8309,LXIII,Ever keep fast (what may appear a thing

8311,LXIII,
8312,LXIV,LXIV
8313,LXIV,"That such a gentle lord had sought her rest,"
8314,LXIV,"Did much the prudent Logistilla please,"

8317,LXIV,"Sometime had Sir Astolpho been her guest,"
8318,LXIV,Whom with a joyful heart Rogero sees.
8319,LXIV,"There in few days resorted all the crew,"

8322,LXV,LXV
8323,LXV,When they a day or more their weariness

8326,LXV,Desired to measure back his western way.
8327,LXV,"Melissa was for both embassadress,"
8328,LXV,"And for the warlike pair, with humble say"
8329,LXV,"To favour, warn and help them, prayed the dame;"
8330,LXV,So that they might return from whence they came.
8331,LXV,
8332,LXVI,LXVI
8333,LXVI,"""I"" (said the fay) ""will think upon this need,"
8334,LXVI,"And in two days the pair will expedite."""
8335,LXVI,Then thought how good Rogero she should speed.
8336,LXVI,And afterwards how aid the English knight.
8337,LXVI,"She wills the first shall, on the griffin steed,"
8338,LXVI,To the Aquitanian shores direct his flight;
8339,LXVI,But first will fashion for the flying-horse
8340,LXVI,"A bit, to guide him and restrain his course."
8341,LXVI,
8342,LXVII,LXVII
8343,LXVII,"She shows him what to do, if he on high"
8344,LXVII,"Would make him soar, or down to earth would bring,"
8345,LXVII,"And what, would he in circles make him fly,"
8346,LXVII,"Or swiftly speed, or pause upon the wing."
8347,LXVII,And all that skilful horsemen use to try
8348,LXVII,"Upon plain ground, beneath her tutoring,"
8349,LXVII,"Rogero learned in air, and gained dominion"
8350,LXVII,Over the griffin-steed of soaring pinion.
8351,LXVII,
8352,LXVIII,LXVIII
8353,LXVIII,"When at all points Rogero was prepared,"
8354,LXVIII,"He bade farewell to the protecting fay,"
8355,LXVIII,"For ever to the loving knight endeared,"
8356,LXVIII,And issued from her realm upon his way.
8357,LXVIII,"I first of him, who on his journey fared"
8358,LXVIII,"In happy hour, and afterwards shall say"
8359,LXVIII,"Of the English knight, who spent more time and pain"
8360,LXVIII,Seeking the friendly court of Charlemagne.
8361,LXVIII,
8362,LXIX,LXIX
8363,LXIX,Rogero thence departs; but as before
8364,LXIX,"Takes not the way he took in his despite,"
8365,LXIX,"When him above the sea the courser bore,"
8366,LXIX,And seldom was the land beneath in sight.
8367,LXIX,"But taught to make him beat his wings and soar,"
8368,LXIX,"Here, there, as liked him best, with docile flight,"
8369,LXIX,"Returning, he another path pursued;"
8370,LXIX,"As Magi erst, who Herod's snare eschewed."
8371,LXIX,
8372,LXX,LXX
8373,LXX,"Borne hither, good Rogero, leaving Spain,"
8374,LXX,"Had sought, in level line, the Indian lands,"
8375,LXX,Where they are watered by the Eastern main;
8376,LXX,Where the two fairies strove with hostile bands.
8377,LXX,He now resolved to visit other reign
8378,LXX,Than that where Aeolus his train commands;
8379,LXX,"And finish so the round he had begun,"
8380,LXX,Circling the world beneath him like the sun.
8381,LXX,
8382,LXXI,LXXI
8383,LXXI,"Here the Catay, and there he Mangiane,"
8384,LXXI,Passing the great Quinsay beheld; in air
8385,LXXI,"Above Imavus turned, and Sericane"
8386,LXXI,Left on the right; and thence did ever bear
8387,LXXI,From the north Scythians to the Hyrcanian main:
8388,LXXI,"So reached Sarmatia's distant land; and, where"
8389,LXXI,"Europe and Asia's parted climes divide,"
8390,LXXI,"Russ, Prussian, he and Pomeranian spied."
8391,LXXI,
8392,LXXII,LXXII
8393,LXXII,Although the Child by every wish was pressed
8394,LXXII,"Quickly to seek his Bradamant, yet he"
8395,LXXII,"With taste of roving round the world possest,"
8396,LXXII,"Would not desist from it, till Hungary"
8397,LXXII,"He had seen; and Polacks, Germans, and the rest"
8398,LXXII,"Should in his wide extended circuit see,"
8399,LXXII,"Inhabiting that horrid, northern land;"
8400,LXXII,And came at last to England's farthest strand.
8401,LXXII,
8402,LXXIII,LXXIII
8403,LXXIII,"Yet think not, sir, that in so long a flight,"
8404,LXXIII,The warrior is for ever on the wing.
8405,LXXIII,"Who lodges, housed in tavern every night,"
8406,LXXIII,"As best as can, through his capacious ring."
8407,LXXIII,So nights and days he passes: such delight
8408,LXXIII,Prospects to him of land and ocean bring.
8409,LXXIII,"Arrived one morn nigh London-town, he stopt;"
8410,LXXIII,And over Thames the flying courser dropt.
8411,LXXIII,
8412,LXXIV,LXXIV
8413,LXXIV,Where he in meadows to the city nigh
8414,LXXIV,"Saw troops of men at arms, and footmen spread;"
8415,LXXIV,"Who, to the drum and trumpet marching by,"
8416,LXXIV,"Divided into goodly bands, were led"
8417,LXXIV,"Before Rinaldo, flower of chivalry;"
8418,LXXIV,He that (if you remember it) was said
8419,LXXIV,"To have been sent by Charlemagne, and made"
8420,LXXIV,His envoy to these parts in search of aid.
8421,LXXIV,
8422,LXXV,LXXV
8423,LXXV,Rogero came exactly as the show
8424,LXXV,"Of that fair host was made without the town,"
8425,LXXV,And of a knight the occasion sought to know;
8426,LXXV,But from the griffin-horse first lighted down:
8427,LXXV,"And he who courteous was, informed him how"
8428,LXXV,"Of kingdoms holding of the British crown,"
8429,LXXV,"English, Scotch, Irish, and the Islands nigh,"
8430,LXXV,"Those many banners were, upreared on high:"
8431,LXXV,
8432,LXXVI,LXXVI
8433,LXXVI,"And added, having ended this display"
8434,LXXVI,"Of arms, the troops would file towards the strand,"
8435,LXXVI,"Where vessels anchored in the harbour lay,"
8436,LXXVI,Waiting to bear them to another land.
8437,LXXVI,"""The French beseiged, rejoice in this array,"
8438,LXXVI,And hope (he said) deliverance through the band.
8439,LXXVI,"But that I may of all inform you well,"
8440,LXXVI,I of each troop shall separately tell.

8622,XCV,XCV
8623,XCV,The cruel and inhospitable crew
8624,XCV,To the voracious beast the dame expose
8625,XCV,"Upon the sea-beat shore, as bare to view"
8626,XCV,As nature did at first her work compose.
8627,XCV,"Not even a veil she had, to shade the hue"
8628,XCV,"Of the white lily and vermillion rose,"
8629,XCV,"Which mingled in her lovely members meet,"
8630,XCV,Proof to December-snow and July-heat.
8631,XCV,
8632,XCVI,XCVI
8633,XCVI,Her would Rogero have some statue deemed
8634,XCVI,"Of alabaster made, or marble rare,"
8635,XCVI,Which to the rugged rock so fastened seemed
8636,XCVI,"By the industrious sculptor's cunning care,"
8637,XCVI,But that he saw distinct a tear which streamed
8638,XCVI,"Amid fresh-opening rose and lily fair,"
8639,XCVI,"Stand on her budding paps beneath in dew,"
8640,XCVI,And that her golden hair dishevelled flew.
8641,XCVI,
8642,XCVII,XCVII
8643,XCVII,"And as he fastened his on her fair eyes,"
8644,XCVII,His Bradamant he called to mind again.
8645,XCVII,Pity and love within his bosom rise
8646,XCVII,"At once, and ill he can from tears refrain:"
8647,XCVII,"And in soft tone he to the damsel cries,"
8648,XCVII,(When he has checked his flying courser's rein)
8649,XCVII,"""O lady, worthy but that chain to wear,"
8650,XCVII,"With which Love's faithful servants fettered are,"
8651,XCVII,
8652,XCVIII,XCVIII
8653,XCVIII,"""And most unworthy this or other ill,"
8654,XCVIII,What wretch has had the cruelty to wound
8655,XCVIII,"And gall those snowy hands with livid stain,"
8656,XCVIII,"Thus painfully with griding fetters bound?"""
8657,XCVIII,"At this she cannot choose but show like grain,"
8658,XCVIII,Of crimson spreading on an ivory ground;
8659,XCVIII,"Knowing those secret beauties are espied,"
8660,XCVIII,"Which, howsoever lovely, shame would hide;"
8661,XCVIII,
8662,XCIX,XCIX
8663,XCIX,"And gladly with her hands her face would hood,"
8664,XCIX,Were they not fastened to the rugged stone:
8665,XCIX,But with her tears (for this at least she could)
8666,XCIX,"Bedewed it, and essayed to hold it down."
8667,XCIX,Sobbing some while the lovely damsel stood;
8668,XCIX,Then loosed her tongue and spake in feeble tone;
8669,XCIX,"But ended not; arrested in mid-word,"
8670,XCIX,By a loud noise which in the sea was heard.
8671,XCIX,
8672,C,C
8673,C,"Lo!  and behold!  the unmeasured-beast appears,"
8674,C,"Half surging and half hidden, in such sort"
8675,C,As sped by roaring wind long carack steers
8676,C,"From north or south, towards her destined port."
8677,C,So the sea monster to his food repairs:
8678,C,And now the interval between is short.
8679,C,"Half dead the lady is through fear endured,"
8680,C,Ill by that other's comfort reassured.
8681,C,
8682,CI,CI
8683,CI,"Rogero overhand, not in the rest"
8684,CI,"Carries his lance, and beats, with downright blow,"
8685,CI,"The monstrous orc.  What this resembled best,"
8686,CI,"But a huge, writhing mass, I do not know;"
8687,CI,"Which wore no form of animal exprest,"
8688,CI,"Save in the head, with eyes and teeth of sow."
8689,CI,"His forehead, 'twixt the eyes, Rogero smites,"
8690,CI,But as on steel or rock the weapon lights.
8691,CI,
8692,CII,CII
8693,CII,"When he perceives the first of no avail,"
8694,CII,The knight returns to deal a better blow;
8695,CII,"The orc, who sees the shifting shadow sail"
8696,CII,"Of those huge pinions on the sea below,"
8697,CII,"In furious heat, deserts his sure regale"
8698,CII,"On shore, to follow that deceitful show:"
8699,CII,"And rolls and reels behind it, as it fleets."
8700,CII,"Rogero drops, and oft the stroke repeats."
8701,CII,
8702,CIII,CIII
8703,CIII,"As eagle, that amid her downward flight,"
8704,CIII,"Surveys amid the grass a snake unrolled,"
8705,CIII,"Or where she smoothes upon a sunny height,"
8706,CIII,"Her ruffled plumage, and her scales of gold,"
8707,CIII,Assails it not where prompt with poisonous bite
8708,CIII,To hiss and creep; but with securer hold
8709,CIII,"Gripes it behind, and either pinion clangs,"
8710,CIII,Lest it should turn and wound her with its fangs;
8711,CIII,
8712,CIV,CIV
8713,CIV,So the fell orc Rogero does not smite
8714,CIV,"With lance or faulchion where the tushes grow,"
8715,CIV,But aims that 'twixt the ears his blow may light;
8716,CIV,"Now on the spine, or now on tail below."
8717,CIV,"And still in time descends or soars upright,"
8718,CIV,"And shifts his course, to cheat the veering foe:"
8719,CIV,"But as if beating on a jasper block,"
8720,CIV,Can never cleave the hard and rugged rock.
8721,CIV,
8722,CV,CV
8723,CV,With suchlike warfare is the mastiff vext
8724,CV,"By the bold fly in August's time of dust,"
8725,CV,"Or in the month before or in the next,"
8726,CV,This full of yellow spikes and that of must;
8727,CV,"For ever by the circling plague perplext,"
8728,CV,Whose sting into his eyes or snout is thrust:
8729,CV,And oft the dog's dry teeth are heard to fall;
8730,CV,"But reaching once the foe, he pays for all."
8731,CV,
8732,CVI,CVI
8733,CVI,With his huge tail the troubled waves so sore
8734,CVI,"The monster beats, that they ascend heaven-high;"
8735,CVI,"And the knight knows not if he swim, or soar"
8736,CVI,Upon his feathered courser in mid sky;
8737,CVI,And oft were fain to find himself ashore:
8738,CVI,"For, if long time the spray so thickly fly,"
8739,CVI,"He fears it so will bathe his hippogryph,"
8740,CVI,That he shall vainly covet gourd or skiff.
8741,CVI,
8742,CVII,CVII
8743,CVII,"He then new counsel took, and 'twas the best,"
8744,CVII,With other arms the monster to pursue;
8745,CVII,"And lifting from his shield the covering vest,"
8746,CVII,To dazzle with the light his blasted view.
8747,CVII,"Landward towards the rock-chained maid he pressed,"
8748,CVII,"And on her little finger, lest a new"
8749,CVII,"Mischance should follow, slipt the ring, which brought"
8750,CVII,The enchantment of the magic shield to nought.
8751,CVII,
8752,CVIII,CVIII
8753,CVIII,"I say the ring, which Bradamant, to free"
8754,CVIII,"Rogero, from Brunello's hand had rent,"
8755,CVIII,"And which, to snatch him from Alcina, she"
8756,CVIII,Had next to India by Melissa sent.
8757,CVIII,"Melissa (as before was said by me),"
8758,CVIII,In aid of many used the instrument;
8759,CVIII,And to Rogero this again had born;
8760,CVIII,By whom 'twas ever on his finger worn.
8761,CVIII,
8762,CIX,CIX
8763,CIX,He gave it now Angelica; for he
8764,CIX,"Feared lest the buckler's light should be impaired,"
8765,CIX,And willed as well those beauteous eyes should be
8766,CIX,"Defended, which had him already snared."
8767,CIX,"Pressing beneath his paunch full half the sea,"
8768,CIX,Now to the shore the monstrous whale repaired:
8769,CIX,"Firm stood Rogero, and the veil undone,"
8770,CIX,Appeared to give the sky another sun.
8771,CIX,
8772,CX,CX
8773,CX,"He in the monster's eyes the radiance throws,"
8774,CX,Which works as it was wont in other time.
8775,CX,As trout or grayling to the bottom goes
8776,CX,"In stream, which mountaineer disturbs with lime;"
8777,CX,So the enchanted buckler overthrows
8778,CX,"The orc, reversed among the foam and slime."
8779,CX,Rogero here and there the beast astound
8780,CX,"Still beats, but cannot find the way to wound."
8781,CX,
8782,CXI,CXI
8783,CXI,This while the lady begs him not to bray
8784,CXI,Longer the monster's rugged scale in vain.
8785,CXI,"""For heaven's sake turn and loose me"" (did she say,"
8786,CXI,"Still weeping) ""ere the orc awake again."
8787,CXI,"Bear me with thee, and drown me in mid-way."
8788,CXI,"Let me not this foul monster's food remain."""
8789,CXI,"By her just plaint Rogero moved, forebore,"
8790,CXI,"Untied the maid, and raised her from the shore."
8791,CXI,
8792,CXII,CXII
8793,CXII,"Upon the beach the courser plants his feet,"
8794,CXII,"And goaded by the rowel, towers in air,"
8795,CXII,"And gallops with Rogero in mid seat,"
8796,CXII,While on the croup behind him sate the fair;
8797,CXII,Who of his banquet so the monster cheat;
8798,CXII,For him too delicate and dainty fare.
8799,CXII,Rogero turns and with thick kisses plies
8800,CXII,The lady's snowy breast and sparkling eyes.
8801,CXII,
8802,CXIII,CXIII
8803,CXIII,"He kept no more the way, as he before"
8804,CXIII,"Proposed, for compassing the whole of Spain:"
8805,CXIII,But stopt his courser on the neighbouring shore
8806,CXIII,Where lesser Britain runs into the main.
8807,CXIII,"Upon the bank there rose an oakwood hoar,"
8808,CXIII,Where Philomel for ever seemed to plain;
8809,CXIII,"I' the middle was a meadow with a fountain,"
8810,CXIII,"And, at each end, a solitary mountain."
8811,CXIII,
8812,CXIV,CXIV
8813,CXIV,"'Twas here the wishful knight first checked the rein,"
8814,CXIV,"And dropping in the meadow, made his steed"
8815,CXIV,"Furl, yet not shut so close, his wings again,"
8816,CXIV,As he had spread them wide for better speed.
8817,CXIV,"Down lights Rogero, and forbears with pain"
8818,CXIV,From other leap; but this his arms impede:
8819,CXIV,"His arms impede; a bar to his desire,"
8820,CXIV,And he must doff them would he slake the fire.
8821,CXIV,
8822,CXV,CXV
8823,CXV,"Now here, now there, confused by different throng,"
8824,CXV,Rogero did his shining arms undo:
8825,CXV,Never the task appeared to him so long;
8826,CXV,"For where he loosed one knot, he fastened two."
8827,CXV,"But, sir, too long continued is this song,"
8828,CXV,And haply may as well have wearied you;
8829,CXV,"So that I shall delay to other time,"
8830,CXV,"When it may better please, my tedious rhyme."

9006,XVII,XVII
9007,XVII,"Covered with shield and sword, one, leaping, sped"

9010,XVII,"Should fall, with which the giant still offended: --"
9011,XVII,"On the field lay his horse, already dead."
9012,XVII,"Rogero paused, and to the strife attended:"
9013,XVII,"And straight his wishes leant towards the knight,"
9014,XVII,Whom he would fain see conqueror in the fight:
9015,XVII,
9016,XVIII,XVIII
9017,XVIII,"Yet not for this would lend the champion aid,"
9018,XVIII,But to behold the cruel strife stood nigh.
9019,XVIII,Lo!  a two-handed stroke the giant made
9020,XVIII,"Upon the lesser warrior's casque, and by"

9022,XVIII,"The other, when astound he saw him lie,"
9023,XVIII,"To deal the foe his death, his helm untied,"

9025,XVIII,
9026,XIX,XIX
9027,XIX,"Of his sweet lady, of his passing fair,"

9029,XIX,The lovely visage of its helmet bare;
9030,XIX,"Towards whom, to deal her death, the giant hies:"
9031,XIX,"So that, advancing with his sword in air,"
9032,XIX,"To sudden battle him the Child defies,"
9033,XIX,"But he, who will not wait for new alarm,"
9034,XIX,"Takes the half-lifeless lady in his arm,"
9035,XIX,
9036,XX,XX
9037,XX,And on his shoulder flings and bears away;

9057,XXII,But with small boot: for the impious enemy
9058,XXII,"Of human nature, taught the bolt to frame,"
9059,XXII,"After the shaft, which darting from the sky"
9060,XXII,"Pierces the cloud and comes to ground in flame,"
9061,XXII,"Who, when he tempted Eve to eat and die"
9062,XXII,"With the apple, hardly wrought more scathe and shame,"
9063,XXII,"Some deal before, or in our grandsires' day,"
9064,XXII,Guided a necromancer where it lay.

9067,XXIII,"More than a hundred fathom buried so,"
9068,XXIII,"Where hidden it had lain a mighty space,"
9069,XXIII,The infernal tool by magic from below
9070,XXIII,Was fished and born amid the German race;
9071,XXIII,"Who, by one proof and the other, taught to know"
9072,XXIII,"Its powers, and he who plots for our disgrace,"
9073,XXIII,"The demon, working on their weaker wit,"
9074,XXIII,As last upon its fatal purpose hit.

9077,XXIV,"To Italy and France, on every hand"
9078,XXIV,The cruel art among all people past:
9079,XXIV,"And these the bronze in hollow mould expand,"
9080,XXIV,First in the furnace melted by the blast:
9081,XXIV,"Others the iron bore, and small or grand,"
9082,XXIV,Fashion the various tube they pierce or cast.
9083,XXIV,"And bombard, gun, according to its frame,"
9084,XXIV,"Or single cannon this, or double, name."
9085,XXIV,
9086,XXV,XXV
9087,XXV,"This saker, culverine, or falcon hight,"
9088,XXV,I hear (all names the inventor has bestowed);
9089,XXV,"Which splits or shivers steel and stone outright,"
9090,XXV,"And, where the bullet passes, makes a road."
9091,XXV,"-- Down to the sword, restore thy weapons bright,"
9092,XXV,"Sad soldier, to the forge, a useless load;"
9093,XXV,"And gun or carbine on thy shoulder lay,"
9094,XXV,"Who without these, I wot, shalt touch no pay."
9095,XXV,
9096,XXVI,XXVI
9097,XXVI,"How, foul and pestilent discovery,"
9098,XXVI,Didst thou find place within the human heart?
9099,XXVI,"Through thee is martial glory lost, through thee"
9100,XXVI,The trade of arms became a worthless art:
9101,XXVI,"And at such ebb are worth and chivalry,"
9102,XXVI,That the base often plays the better part.
9103,XXVI,"Through thee no more shall gallantry, no more"
9104,XXVI,Shall valour prove their prowess as of yore.
9105,XXVI,
9106,XXVII,XXVII
9107,XXVII,"Through thee, alas!  are dead, or have to die,"
9108,XXVII,So many noble lords and cavaliers
9109,XXVII,"Before this war shall end, which, Italy"
9110,XXVII,"Afflicting most, has drowned the world in tears,"
9111,XXVII,"That, if I said the word, I err not, I,"
9112,XXVII,Saying he sure the cruellest appears
9113,XXVII,"And worst, of nature's impious and malign,"
9114,XXVII,Who did this hateful engine first design:
9115,XXVII,
9116,XXVIII,XXVIII
9117,XXVIII,"And I shall think, in order to pursue"
9118,XXVIII,"The sin for ever, God has doomed to hell"
9119,XXVIII,"That cursed soul, amid the unhappy crew,"
9120,XXVIII,Beside the accursed Judas there to dwell.
9121,XXVIII,"But follow we the good Orlando, who"
9122,XXVIII,"So burns to seek Ebuda's island fell,"
9123,XXVIII,Whose foul inhabitants a monster sate
9124,XXVIII,"With flesh of women, fair and delicate."
9125,XXVIII,
9126,XXIX,XXIX
9127,XXIX,But no less slow than eager was the knight:
9128,XXIX,"The winds appear, which still his course delay;"
9129,XXIX,"Who, whether blowing on the left or right,"
9130,XXIX,"Or poop, so faintly in his canvas play,"
9131,XXIX,"His bark makes little speed; and, spent outright,"
9132,XXIX,"The breeze which wafts her sometimes dies away,"
9133,XXIX,"Or blows so foul, that he is fain to steer"
9134,XXIX,"Another course, or to the leeward veer."

9136,XXX,XXX
9137,XXX,"It was the will of Heaven that he, before"
9138,XXX,"The King of Ireland, should not reach the land,"
9139,XXX,The he with greater ease upon that shore
9140,XXX,Might act what shortly you shall understand.
9141,XXX,"""Make for the isle.  Now"" (said he) ""may'st thou moor,"""
9142,XXX,"(Thus issuing to the pilot his command),"
9143,XXX,"""And give me for my need the skiff; for I"

9145,XXX,
9146,XXXI,XXXI
9147,XXXI,"""The biggest cable that thou hast aboard,"
9148,XXXI,And biggest anchor to my hands consign;
9149,XXXI,"Thou shalt perceive why thus my boat is stored,"
9150,XXXI,"If I but meet that monster of the brine."""
9151,XXXI,"He bade them lower the pinnace overboard,"
9152,XXXI,With all things that befitted his design:
9153,XXXI,"His arms he left behind, except his blade,"
9154,XXXI,And singly for the rocky island made.
9155,XXXI,
9156,XXXII,XXXII
9157,XXXII,"Home to his breast the count pulls either oar,"
9158,XXXII,"With the island at his back, to which he wends,"
9159,XXXII,"In guise that, crawling up the sandy shore,"
9160,XXXII,The crooked crab from sea or marsh ascends.
9161,XXXII,It was the hour Aurora gay before
9162,XXXII,The rising sun her yellow hair extends
9163,XXXII,"(His orb as yet half-seen, half-hid from sight)"
9164,XXXII,Not without stirring jealous Tithon's spite.
9165,XXXII,
9166,XXXIII,XXXIII
9167,XXXIII,Approaching to the naked rock as near
9168,XXXIII,"As vigorous hand might serve to cast a stone,"
9169,XXXIII,"He knew not if he heard, or did not hear"
9170,XXXIII,"A cry, so faint and feeble was the moan."
9171,XXXIII,"When, turning to the left, the cavalier,"
9172,XXXIII,"His level sight along the water thrown,"
9173,XXXIII,"Naked as born, bound to a stump, espied"
9174,XXXIII,A dame whose feet were wetted by the tide.
9175,XXXIII,
9176,XXXIV,XXXIV
9177,XXXIV,"Because she distant is, and evermore"
9178,XXXIV,"Holds down her face, he ill can her discern:"
9179,XXXIV,"Both sculls he pulls amain, and nears the shore,"
9180,XXXIV,With keen desire more certain news to learn:
9181,XXXIV,"But now the winding beach is heard to roar,"
9182,XXXIV,And wood and cave the mighty noise return;
9183,XXXIV,"The billows swell, and, lo!  the beast!  who pressed,"
9184,XXXIV,And nigh concealed the sea beneath his breast.
9185,XXXIV,
9186,XXXV,XXXV
9187,XXXV,"As cloud from humid vale is seen to rise,"
9188,XXXV,"Pregnant with rain and storm, which seems withal"
9189,XXXV,"To extinguished day, and charged with deeper dyes"
9190,XXXV,"Than night, to spread throughout this earthly ball,"
9191,XXXV,"So swims the beast, who so much occupies"
9192,XXXV,"Of sea, he may be said to keep it all."
9193,XXXV,"Waves roar: collected in himself, the peer"
9194,XXXV,"Looks proudly on, unchanged in heart and cheer."
9195,XXXV,
9196,XXXVI,XXXVI
9197,XXXVI,"He, as one well resolved in his intent,"
9198,XXXVI,Moved quickly to perform the feat he planned;
9199,XXXVI,"And, for he would the damsel's harm prevent,"
9200,XXXVI,"And would with that assail the beast at hand,"
9201,XXXVI,"Between her and the orc the boat he sent,"
9202,XXXVI,"Leaving within the sheath his idle brand,"
9203,XXXVI,"Anchor and cable next he takes in hold,"
9204,XXXVI,And waits the foe with constant heart and bold.
9205,XXXVI,
9206,XXXVII,XXXVII
9207,XXXVII,"As soon as him the monster has descried,"
9208,XXXVII,"And skiff at little interval, his throat"
9209,XXXVII,"The fish, to swallow him, expands so wide,"
9210,XXXVII,That horse and horseman through his jaws might float.
9211,XXXVII,"Here Roland with the anchor, and beside"
9212,XXXVII,(Unless I am mistaken) with the boat
9213,XXXVII,"Plunged, and engulphed the parted teeth betwixt,"
9214,XXXVII,His anchor in the tongue and palate fixt;
9215,XXXVII,
9216,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
9217,XXXVIII,So that the monster could no longer drop
9218,XXXVIII,"Or raise his horrid jaws, which this extends."
9219,XXXVIII,'Tis thus who digs the mine is wont to prop
9220,XXXVIII,"The ground, and where he works the roof suspends,"
9221,XXXVIII,"Lest sudden ruin whelm him from atop,"
9222,XXXVIII,While he incautiously his task intends.
9223,XXXVIII,Roland (so far apart was either hook)
9224,XXXVIII,But by a leap could reach the highest crook.
9225,XXXVIII,
9226,XXXIX,XXXIX
9227,XXXIX,"The prop so placed, Orlando now secure"
9228,XXXIX,"That the fell beast his mouth no more can close,"
9229,XXXIX,"Unsheathes his sword, and, in that cave obscure,"
9230,XXXIX,"Deals here and there, now thrusts, now trenchant blows."
9231,XXXIX,"As well as citadel, whose walls immure"
9232,XXXIX,"The assailants, can defend her from her foes,"
9233,XXXIX,"The monster, harassed by the war within,"
9234,XXXIX,Defends himself against the Paladin.
9235,XXXIX,
9236,XL,XL
9237,XL,"Now floats the monstrous beast, o'ercome with pain,"
9238,XL,Whose scaly flanks upon the waves expand;
9239,XL,"And now descends into the deepest main,"
9240,XL,"Scowers at the bottom, and stirs up the sand."
9241,XL,"The rising flood ill able to sustain,"
9242,XL,"The cavalier swims forth, and makes for land."
9243,XL,"He leaves the anchor fastened in his tongue,"
9244,XL,And grasps the rope which from the anchor hung.
9245,XL,
9246,XLI,XLI
9247,XLI,"So swimming till the island is attained,"
9248,XLI,With this towards the rock Orlando speeds:
9249,XLI,"He hawls the anchor home (a footing gained),"
9250,XLI,"Pricked by whose double fluke, the monster bleeds."
9251,XLI,"The labouring orc to follow is constrained,"
9252,XLI,Dragged by that force which every force exceeds;
9253,XLI,Which at a single sally more achieves
9254,XLI,Than at ten turns the circling windlass heaves.
9255,XLI,
9256,XLII,XLII
9257,XLII,"As a wild bull, about whose horn is wound"
9258,XLII,"The unexpected noose, leaps here and there,"
9259,XLII,"When he has felt the cord, and turns him round,"
9260,XLII,"And rolls and rises, yet slips not the snare;"
9261,XLII,"So from his pleasant seat and ancient bound,"
9262,XLII,"Dragged by that arm and rope he cannot tear,"
9263,XLII,"With thousands of strange wheels and thousand slides,"
9264,XLII,The monster follows where the cable guides.
9265,XLII,
9266,XLIII,XLIII
9267,XLIII,This the red sea with reason would be hight
9268,XLIII,"To-day, such streams of blood have changed its hue;"
9269,XLIII,"And where the monster lashed it in his spite,"
9270,XLIII,The eye its bottom through the waves might view.
9271,XLIII,"And now he splashed the sky, and dimmed the light"
9272,XLIII,"Of the clear sun, so high the water flew."
9273,XLIII,"The noise re-echoing round, the distant shore"
9274,XLIII,And wood and hill rebound the deafening roar.
9275,XLIII,
9276,XLIV,XLIV
9277,XLIV,"Forth from his grotto aged Proteus hies,"
9278,XLIV,And mounts above the surface at the sound;
9279,XLIV,"And having seen Orlando dive, and rise"
9280,XLIV,"From the orc, and drag the monstrous fish to ground,"
9281,XLIV,"His scattered flock forgot, o'er ocean flies;"
9282,XLIV,"While so the din increases, that, astound,"
9283,XLIV,"Neptune bids yoke his dolphins, and that day"
9284,XLIV,For distant Aethiopia posts away.

9290,XLV,"They know not whither, speed, some here, some there."
9291,XLV,"Orlando draws to land, the billows sweeping,"
9292,XLV,"That horrid fish, but might his labour spare:"
9293,XLV,"For, with the torment worn, and travel sore,"
9294,XLV,"The brute, exhausted, died, ere dragged ashore."

9296,XLVI,XLVI
9297,XLVI,"Of the islanders had trooped no petty throng,"
9298,XLVI,"To witness that strange fight, who by a vain"
9299,XLVI,"And miserable superstition stung,"
9300,XLVI,Esteemed such holy deed a work profane;
9301,XLVI,And said that this would be another wrong
9302,XLVI,"To Proteus, and provoke his ire again;"
9303,XLVI,"Make him his herds pour forth upon the strand,"
9304,XLVI,And with the whole old warfare vex the land;
9305,XLVI,
9306,XLVII,XLVII
9307,XLVII,"And that it better were to sue for peace,"
9308,XLVII,"First from the injured god, lest worse ensue;"
9309,XLVII,"And Proteus from his cruel hate would cease,"
9310,XLVII,If they into the sea the offender threw.
9311,XLVII,"As torch to torch gives fire, and lights increase,"
9312,XLVII,"Until the flame is spread the country through,"
9313,XLVII,"Even so from heart to heart the fury spread,"
9314,XLVII,Which in the waves would doom Orlando dead.
9315,XLVII,
9316,XLVIII,XLVIII
9317,XLVIII,"These, armed with sling or bow, upon the shore,"

9319,XLVIII,"And on each side, behind him and before,"
9320,XLVIII,"Distant and near, as best they can, offend."
9321,XLVIII,At such a brutal insult wonders sore
9322,XLVIII,"The peer, who sees that mischief they intend,"
9323,XLVIII,"In vengeance for the cruel monster slain,"
9324,XLVIII,"Whence he had glory hoped, and praise to gain."
9325,XLVIII,
9326,XLIX,XLIX
9327,XLIX,"But as the usage is of surly bear,"
9328,XLIX,"By sturdy Russ or Lithuanian led,"
9329,XLIX,"Little to heed the dogs in crowded fair,"
9330,XLIX,"Nor even at their yelps to turn his head,"
9331,XLIX,The clamour of the churls assembled there
9332,XLIX,Orlando witnessed with as little dread;
9333,XLIX,"Who knew that he the rout which threatened death,"
9334,XLIX,Had power to scatter at a single breath:
9335,XLIX,
9336,L,L

9338,L,"When turned on them, he grasped his trenchant blade."
9339,L,"Misjudging of his worth, the foolish race"

9341,L,"Since him they saw no covering buckler brace,"
9342,L,"Uncuirassed, nor in other arms arrayed;"
9343,L,"But knew not that, from head to foot, a skin"
9344,L,More hard than diamond cased the Paladin.
9345,L,
9346,LI,LI
9347,LI,"What by Orlando others cannot do,"
9348,LI,The knight by others can; at half a score
9349,LI,Of blows in all he thirty killed; by few
9350,LI,"He passed that measure, if the strokes were more:"
9351,LI,And had already turned him to undo
9352,LI,"The naked lady, having cleared the shore,"
9353,LI,"When other larum sounds, and other cries"
9354,LI,From a new quarter of the island rise.
9355,LI,
9356,LII,LII
9357,LII,While so the Paladin had kept in play
9358,LII,"The barbarous islanders, upon that hand,"
9359,LII,"The men of Ireland, without let or fray,"
9360,LII,Had poured from many quarters on the strand:
9361,LII,"And now, without remorse or pity, slay"
9362,LII,"The inhabitants, through all the wasted land;"
9363,LII,"And, was it justice moved, or cruel rage,"
9364,LII,Slaughter without regard to sex or age.

9366,LIII,LIII
9367,LIII,Little or no defender the island-crew

9370,LIII,And that those few without a purpose are.
9371,LIII,"'Mid sack and fire, the wasted country through,"
9372,LIII,"The islanders are slain, and everwhere"

9396,LVI,LVI
9397,LVI,Orlando asks what evil destiny
9398,LVI,Her to that cruel island had conveyed
9399,LVI,From where she in as much felicity
9400,LVI,Was with her consort left as could be said:
9401,LVI,"""I know not (cried the weeping dame) if I"
9402,LVI,"Have thanks to render thee for death delayed,"
9403,LVI,"Or should lament me that, through means of thee,"
9404,LVI,This day did not my woes concluded see.
9405,LVI,
9406,LVII,LVII
9407,LVII,"""I have to thank thee that from death, too dread"
9408,LVII,"And monstrous, thy good arm deliverance gave;"
9409,LVII,"Which would have been too monstrous, had I fed"
9410,LVII,"The beast, and in his belly found a grave:"
9411,LVII,"But cannot thank thee that I am not dead,"
9412,LVII,"Since death alone can me from misery save,"
9413,LVII,"Well shall I thank thee for that wished relief,"
9414,LVII,"Which can deliver me from every grief."""
9415,LVII,
9416,LVIII,LVIII
9417,LVIII,"Next she related, with loud sobs and sighs,"
9418,LVIII,How her false spouse betrayed her as she lay
9419,LVIII,"Asleep, and how of pirates made the prize,"
9420,LVIII,They bore her from the desert isle away.
9421,LVIII,"And, as she spake, she turned her in the guise"
9422,LVIII,"Of Dian, framed by artists, who pourtray"
9423,LVIII,"Her carved or painted, as in liquid font"
9424,LVIII,She threw the water in Actaeon's front.
9425,LVIII,
9426,LIX,LIX
9427,LIX,"For, as she can, her waist she hides, and breast,"
9428,LIX,More liberal of flowing flank and reins.
9429,LIX,"Roland desires his ship, to find a vest"
9430,LIX,"To cover her, delivered from her chains:"
9431,LIX,"While he is all intent upon this quest,"
9432,LIX,"Oberto comes; Oberto, he that reigns"
9433,LIX,"O'er Ireland's people, who had understood"

9435,LIX,
9436,LX,LX
9437,LX,"And, swimming, how, amid the watery roar,"
9438,LX,A knight a weighty anchor in his throat
9439,LX,"Had fix'd, and so had dragged him to the shore,"
9440,LX,As men against the current track a boat.
9441,LX,"This while Oberto comes; who, if his lore,"
9442,LX,"Who told the tale, were true, desires to note;"
9443,LX,"While his invading army, far and wide,"
9444,LX,Ebuda burn and waste on every side.

9450,LXI,"Whom he had entered bodily, he bore,"
9451,LXI,He for the country knew the stranger knight
9452,LXI,"As he perused his face; so much the more,"

9454,LXI,Save Roland could such mighty fear have done;
9455,LXI,
9456,LXII,LXII
9457,LXII,"Knew him, because a page of honour he"
9458,LXII,"Had been in France, and for the crown, his right"
9459,LXII,"Upon his father's death, had crossed the sea"
9460,LXII,The year before.  So often he the knight
9461,LXII,"Had seen, and had with him held colloquy,"
9462,LXII,Their times of meeting had been infinite.
9463,LXII,"He doffed his casque, with festive welcome pressed"

9465,LXII,
9466,LXIII,LXIII
9467,LXIII,Orlando is no less rejoined to see
9468,LXIII,"The king, than is the king that champion true."
9469,LXIII,After with friendly cheer and equal glee
9470,LXIII,"Had once or twice embraced the noble two,"
9471,LXIII,To Oberto Roland told the treachery
9472,LXIII,"Which had been done the youthful dame, and who"
9473,LXIII,"Had done it, -- false Bireno -- that among"
9474,LXIII,All men should least have sought to do her wrong.
9475,LXIII,
9476,LXIV,LXIV
9477,LXIV,To him he told the many proofs and clear
9478,LXIV,By which the dame's affection had been tried;
9479,LXIV,And how she for Bireno kin and geer
9480,LXIV,"Had lost, and would in fine for him have died."
9481,LXIV,"And how he this could warrant, and appear"
9482,LXIV,"To vouch for much, as witness on her side."
9483,LXIV,"While thus to him her griefs Orlando showed,"
9484,LXIV,The lady's shining eyes with tears o'erflowed.

9486,LXV,LXV
9487,LXV,Her face was such as sometimes in the spring
9488,LXV,"We see a doubtful sky, when on the plain"
9489,LXV,"A shower descends, and the sun, opening"
9490,LXV,"His cloudy veil, looks out amid the rain."
9491,LXV,And as the nightingale then loves to sing
9492,LXV,"From branch of verdant stem her dulcet strain,"
9493,LXV,So in her beauteous tears his pinions bright
9494,LXV,"Love bathes, rejoicing in the chrystal light."
9495,LXV,
9496,LXVI,LXVI
9497,LXVI,The stripling heats his golden arrow's head
9498,LXVI,"At her bright eyes, then slacks the weapon's glow"
9499,LXVI,"In streams, which falls between white flowers and red;"
9500,LXVI,"And, the shaft tempered, strongly draws his bow,"
9501,LXVI,"And roves at him, o'er whom no shield is spread,"
9502,LXVI,"Nor iron rind, nor double mail below;"
9503,LXVI,"Who, gazing on her tresses, eyes, and brow,"
9504,LXVI,"Feels that his heart is pierced, he knows not how."
9505,LXVI,
9506,LXVII,LXVII
9507,LXVII,"Olympia's beauties are of those most rare,"
9508,LXVII,Nor is the forehead's beauteous curve alone
9509,LXVII,"Excellent, and her eyes and cheeks and hair,"
9510,LXVII,"Mouth, nose, and throat, and shoulders; but, so down"
9511,LXVII,"Descending from the lady's bosom fair,"
9512,LXVII,"Parts which are wont to be concealed by gown,"
9513,LXVII,"Are such, as haply should be placed before"
9514,LXVII,Whate'er this ample world contains in store.
9515,LXVII,
9516,LXVIII,LXVIII
9517,LXVIII,"In whiteness they surpassed unsullied snow,"
9518,LXVIII,Smooth ivory to the touch: above were seen
9519,LXVIII,"Two rounding paps, like new-pressed milk in show,"
9520,LXVIII,Fresh-taken from its crate of rushes green;
9521,LXVIII,"The space betwixt was like the valley low,"
9522,LXVIII,"Which oftentimes we see small hills between,"
9523,LXVIII,"Sweet in its season, and now such as when"
9524,LXVIII,Winter with snows has newly filled the glen.
9525,LXVIII,
9526,LXIX,LXIX
9527,LXIX,"The swelling hips and haunches' symmetry,"
9528,LXIX,"The waist more clear than mirror's polished grain,"
9529,LXIX,"And members seem of Phidias' turnery,"
9530,LXIX,Or work of better hand and nicer pain.
9531,LXIX,As well to you of other parts should I
9532,LXIX,"Relate, which she to hide desired in vain."
9533,LXIX,"To sum the beauteous whole, from head to feet,"
9534,LXIX,In her all loveliness is found complete.
9535,LXIX,
9536,LXX,LXX
9537,LXX,And had she in the Idaean glen unveiled
9538,LXX,"In ancient days before the Phrygian swain,"
9539,LXX,By how much heavenly Venus had prevailed
9540,LXX,"I know not, though her rivals strove in vain."
9541,LXX,"Nor haply had the youth for Sparta sailed,"
9542,LXX,To violate the hospitable reign;
9543,LXX,"But said:  ""With Menelaus let Helen rest!"
9544,LXX,"No other prize I seek, of this possest"";"
9545,LXX,
9546,LXXI,LXXI
9547,LXXI,"Or in Crotona dwelt, where the divine"
9548,LXXI,"Zeuxis in days of old his work projected,"
9549,LXXI,"To be the ornament of Juno's shrine,"
9550,LXXI,And hence so many naked dames collected;
9551,LXXI,"And in one form perfection to combine,"
9552,LXXI,"Some separate charm from this or that selected,"
9553,LXXI,He from no other model need have wrought.
9554,LXXI,Since joined in her were all the charms he sought.
9555,LXXI,
9556,LXXII,LXXII
9557,LXXII,I do not think Bireno ever viewed
9558,LXXII,Naked that beauteous form; for sure it were
9559,LXXII,"He never could have been so stern of mood,"
9560,LXXII,As to have left her on that desert lair.
9561,LXXII,"That Ireland's king was fired I well conclude,"
9562,LXXII,Nor hid the flame that he within him bare.
9563,LXXII,"He strives to comfort her, and hope instill,"
9564,LXXII,That future good shall end her present ill.
9565,LXXII,
9566,LXXIII,LXXIII
9567,LXXIII,"And her to Holland promises to bear,"
9568,LXXIII,"And vows till she is to her state restored,"
9569,LXXIII,And just and memorable vengeance there
9570,LXXIII,"Achieved upon her perjured, traitor lord,"
9571,LXXIII,"He never will unceasing war forbear,"
9572,LXXIII,Waged with all means that Ireland can afford;
9573,LXXIII,"And this with all his speed.  He, up and down,"
9574,LXXIII,Meantime bids seek for female vest and gown.
9575,LXXIII,
9576,LXXIV,LXXIV
9577,LXXIV,Now will it need to send in search of vest
9578,LXXIV,"Beyond the savage island's narrow bound,"
9579,LXXIV,"Since thither every day in such came dressed,"
9580,LXXIV,"Some dame, to feed the beast, from countries round."
9581,LXXIV,"Nor long his followers there pursued the quest,"
9582,LXXIV,Ere many they of various fashions found.
9583,LXXIV,So was Olympia clothed; while sad of mood
9584,LXXIV,"Was he, not so to clothe her as he wou'd."
9585,LXXIV,
9586,LXXV,LXXV
9587,LXXV,But never silk so choice or gold so fine
9588,LXXV,"Did the industrious Florentine prepare,"
9589,LXXV,"Nor whosoever broiders gay design,"
9590,LXXV,"Though on his task be spent time, toil, and care,"
9591,LXXV,"Nor Lemnos' god, nor Pallas' art divine,"
9592,LXXV,"Form raiment worthy of those limbs so fair,"
9593,LXXV,That King Oberto cannot choose but he
9594,LXXV,Recalls them at each turn to memory.
9595,LXXV,
9596,LXXVI,LXXVI
9597,LXXVI,"To see that love so kindled by the dame,"
9598,LXXVI,On many grounds Orlando was content;
9599,LXXVI,Who not alone rejoiced that such a shame
9600,LXXVI,"Put upon her, Bireno should repent;"
9601,LXXVI,"But, that in the design on which he came,"
9602,LXXVI,He should be freed from grave impediment.
9603,LXXVI,"Not for Olympia thither had he made,"
9604,LXXVI,"But, were his lady there, to lend her aid."
9605,LXXVI,
9606,LXXVII,LXXVII
9607,LXXVII,"To him, that there she was not, soon was clear,"
9608,LXXVII,"But clear it was not if she had been there,"
9609,LXXVII,"Or no; since of those islesmen, far and near,"
9610,LXXVII,One was not left the tidings to declare.
9611,LXXVII,"The following day they from the haven steer,"
9612,LXXVII,And all united in one squadron fare.
9613,LXXVII,"The Paladin with them to Ireland hies,"
9614,LXXVII,From whence to France the warrior's passage lies.
9615,LXXVII,
9616,LXXVIII,LXXVIII
9617,LXXVIII,Scarcely a day in Ireland's realm he spends:
9618,LXXVIII,And for no prayers his purposed end forbore:
9619,LXXVIII,"Love, that in quest of his liege-lady sends"
9620,LXXVIII,"The knight upon this track, permits no more."
9621,LXXVIII,"Departing, he Olympia recommends"
9622,LXXVIII,"To the Irish monarch, who to serve her swore:"
9623,LXXVIII,Although this needed not; since he was bent
9624,LXXVIII,"More than behoved, her wishes to content:"
9625,LXXVIII,
9626,LXXIX,LXXIX
9627,LXXIX,"So levied in few days his warlike band,"
9628,LXXIX,And (league with England's kind and Scotland's made)
9629,LXXIX,In Holland and in Friesland left no land
9630,LXXIX,"To the false duke, so rapid was the raid."
9631,LXXIX,And to rebel against that lord's command
9632,LXXIX,"His Zealand stirred; nor he the war delayed,"
9633,LXXIX,Until by him Bireno's blood was spilt:
9634,LXXIX,A punishment that ill atoned his guilt.
9635,LXXIX,
9636,LXXX,LXXX
9637,LXXX,"Oberto takes to wife Olympia fair,"

9640,LXXX,"Who furrows , night and day, the billows green,"
9641,LXXX,"And strikes his sails in the same harbour, where"
9642,LXXX,They to the wind erewhile unfurled had been

9647,LXXXI,"The remnant of the winter, he with shield"
9648,LXXXI,"And spear achieved things worthy to be shown,"
9649,LXXXI,"I ween; but these were then so well concealed,"
9650,LXXXI,It is no fault of mine they are not blown;
9651,LXXXI,"For good Orlando was in fighting field,"
9652,LXXXI,"Prompter to do, than make his prowess known."
9653,LXXXI,"Nor e'er was bruited action of the knight,"
9654,LXXXI,Save when some faithful witness was in sight.
9655,LXXXI,
9656,LXXXII,LXXXII
9657,LXXXII,That winter's remnant he so passed that feat
9658,LXXXII,Of his was known not to the public ear;
9659,LXXXII,But when within that animal discreet
9660,LXXXII,"Which Phryxus bore, the sun illumed the sphere,"
9661,LXXXII,"And Zephyrus returning glad and sweet,"
9662,LXXXII,"Brought back with him again the blooming year,"
9663,LXXXII,"The wondrous deeds Orlando did in stower,"
9664,LXXXII,Appeared with the new grass and dainty flower.
9665,LXXXII,
9666,LXXXIII,LXXXIII
9667,LXXXIII,"From plain to hill, from champaign flat to shore,"
9668,LXXXIII,"Oppressed with grief and pain the County fares,"
9669,LXXXIII,"When a long cry, entering a forest hoar,"
9670,LXXXIII,-- A load lamenting smites upon his ears.
9671,LXXXIII,"He grasps his brand and spurs his courser sore,"
9672,LXXXIII,And swiftly pricks toward the sound he hears.
9673,LXXXIII,But I shall at another season say
9674,LXXXIII,"What chanced, and may be heard in future lay."

9828,XIV,Was so estranged from what he wont to be.
9829,XIV,
9830,XV,XV
9831,XV,"He thinks he hears Angelica, and she"

9835,XV,Then shall it in my Roland's presence be
9836,XV,Ravished by this foul robber?  Oh! before

9844,XVI,But tempered with high hope.  Sometimes the peer
9845,XVI,"Stopt in his search and heard a voice complain,"
9846,XVI,Which seemed to be Angelica's:  if here
9847,XVI,"The restless warrior stand, it sounds from there,"

9850,XVII,XVII

9855,XVII,I say that he arrived where Roland dread
9856,XVII,"Arrived before him, if I rightly read."
9857,XVII,"The giant through the golden portal passed,"
9858,XVII,"Rogero close behind, who followed fast."
9859,XVII,
9860,XVIII,XVIII
9861,XVIII,As soon as he his foot has lifted o'er

9863,XVIII,"Nor sees the giant or the lady more,"
9864,XVIII,And vainly glances here and there his eyes.
9865,XVIII,"He up and down returns with labour sore,"
9866,XVIII,Yet not for that his longing satisfies;
9867,XVIII,Nor can imagine where the felon thief
9868,XVIII,Has hid himself and dame in space so brief.
9869,XVIII,
9870,XIX,XIX
9871,XIX,After four times or five he so had wound
9872,XIX,"Above, below, through bower and gallery fair,"
9873,XIX,"He yet returned, and, having nothing found,"
9874,XIX,Searched even to the space beneath the stair.
9875,XIX,"At length, in hope they in the woodlands round"
9876,XIX,"Might be, he sallied; but the voice, which there"
9877,XIX,"Roland recalled, did him no less recall,"
9878,XIX,And made as well return within the Hall.
9879,XIX,
9880,XX,XX
9881,XX,"One voice, one shape, which to Anglantes' peer"

9921,XXIV,"King Sacripant, or Roland, willingly"
9922,XXIV,The damsel would have taken for her guide;
9923,XXIV,"Not that, propitious to their wishes, she"
9924,XXIV,(Averse from both) inclined to either side;
9925,XXIV,"But, since her eastern journey was to be"
9926,XXIV,"Through town and city, scattered far and wide,"
9927,XXIV,"She needed company, and ill had found"
9928,XXIV,More trusty guides than these for such a round.
9929,XXIV,
9930,XXV,XXV
9931,XXV,"Now this, now that she sought with fruitless care,"
9932,XXV,"Before she lit on either warrior's trace,"
9933,XXV,"By city or by farm, now here, now there,"
9934,XXV,"In forest now, and now in other place."
9935,XXV,"Fortune, at length, where caged with Roland are"
9936,XXV,"Ferrau and Sacripant, directs her chase;"
9937,XXV,"Rogero, with Gradasso fierce, and more,"
9938,XXV,Noosed with strange witcheries by Atlantes hoar.
9939,XXV,
9940,XXVI,XXVI
9941,XXVI,"She enters, hidden from the enchanter's eyes,"
9942,XXVI,"And by the ring concealed, examines all;"
9943,XXVI,"And Roland there, and Sacripant espies,"
9944,XXVI,Intent to seek her vainly through the Hall;
9945,XXVI,"And with her image cheating both, descries"
9946,XXVI,Atlantes old.  The damsel doubts withal
9947,XXVI,"Which of the two to take, and long revolves"
9948,XXVI,"This in her doubtful thought, nor well resolves."
9949,XXVI,
9950,XXVII,XXVII
9951,XXVII,"She knows not which with her will best accord,"
9952,XXVII,The Count Orlando or Circassia's knight.
9953,XXVII,"As of most powers, her would Rogero ward"
9954,XXVII,"In passage perilous, with better might."
9955,XXVII,"But should she make the peer her guide, her lord,"
9956,XXVII,"She knew not if her champion she could slight,"
9957,XXVII,"If him she would depress with altered cheer,"
9958,XXVII,Or into France send back the cavalier:
9959,XXVII,
9960,XXVIII,XXVIII
9961,XXVIII,"But Sacripant at pleasure could depose,"
9962,XXVIII,Though him she had uplifted to the sky.
9963,XXVIII,"Hence him alone she for her escort chose,"
9964,XXVIII,And feigned to trust in his fidelity.
9965,XXVIII,"The ring she from her mouth withdraws, and shows"
9966,XXVIII,"Her face, unveiled to the Circassian's eye:"
9967,XXVIII,She thought to him alone; but fierce Ferrau
9968,XXVIII,"And Roland came upon the maid, and saw."
9969,XXVIII,
9970,XXIX,XXIX
9971,XXIX,Ferrau and Roland came upon the maid;
9972,XXIX,For one and the other champion equally
9973,XXIX,Within the palace and without it strayed
9974,XXIX,"In quest of her, who was their deity."
9975,XXIX,"And now, no longer by the enchantment stayed,"
9976,XXIX,"Each ran alike towards the dame, for she"
9977,XXIX,"Had placed the ring upon her hand anew,"
9978,XXIX,Which old Atlantes' every scheme o'erthrew.
9979,XXIX,
9980,XXX,XXX
9981,XXX,Helm on the head and corselet on the breast
9982,XXX,"Of both the knights, of whom I sing, was tied;"
9983,XXX,"By night or day, since they into this rest"
9984,XXX,"Had entered, never doffed and laid aside:"
9985,XXX,"For such to wear were easy as a vest,"
9986,XXX,"To these, so wont the burden to abide."
9987,XXX,"As well was armed, except with iron masque,"
9988,XXX,"Ferrau, who wore not, nor would wear, a casque."
9989,XXX,
9990,XXXI,XXXI
9991,XXXI,"Till he had that erst wrested by the peer,"
9992,XXXI,"Orlando, from the brother of Troyane;"
9993,XXXI,"For so had sworn the Spanish cavalier,"
9994,XXXI,What time he Argalia's helm in vain
9995,XXXI,"Sought in the brook; yet though the count was near,"
9996,XXXI,Has not stretched forth his hand the prize to gain.
9997,XXXI,"For so it was, that neither of the pair"
9998,XXXI,Could recognise the other knight while there.
9999,XXXI,
10000,XXXII,XXXII
10001,XXXII,"Upon the enchanted dome lay such a spell,"
10002,XXXII,That they from one another were concealed;
10003,XXXII,"They doffed not, night nor day, the corselet's shell,"
10004,XXXII,"Not sword, nor even put aside the shield."
10005,XXXII,"Saddled, with bridle hanging at the sell,"
10006,XXXII,"Their steeds were feeding, ready for the field,"
10007,XXXII,"Within a chamber, near the palace door,"
10008,XXXII,With straw and barley heaped in plenteous store.
10009,XXXII,
10010,XXXIII,XXXIII
10011,XXXIII,Nor might nor mean in old Atlantes lies
10012,XXXIII,"To stop the knights from mounting, who repair"
10013,XXXIII,"To their good steeds, to chase the bright black eyes,"
10014,XXXIII,The fair vermillion cheeks and golden hair
10015,XXXIII,"Of the sweet damsel, who before them flies,"
10016,XXXIII,And goads to better speed her panting mare;
10017,XXXIII,"Ill pleased the three assembled to discern,"
10018,XXXIII,Though haply she had taken each in turn.
10019,XXXIII,
10020,XXXIV,XXXIV
10021,XXXIV,And when these from the magic palace she
10022,XXXIV,"Had ticed so far, that she no more supposed"
10023,XXXIV,The warriors to the wicked fallacy
10024,XXXIV,"Of the malign enchanter were exposed,"
10025,XXXIV,"The ring, which more than once from misery"
10026,XXXIV,"Had rescued her, she 'twixt her lips enclosed,"
10027,XXXIV,"Hence from their sight she vanished in a thought,"
10028,XXXIV,"And left them wondering there, like men distraught."
10029,XXXIV,
10030,XXXV,XXXV
10031,XXXV,Although she first the scheme had entertained
10032,XXXV,"Roland or Sacripant to have released,"
10033,XXXV,"To guide her thither, where her father reigned,"
10034,XXXV,"King Galaphron, who ruled i' the farthest East,"
10035,XXXV,"The aid of both she suddenly disdained,"
10036,XXXV,And in an instant from her project ceased;
10037,XXXV,"And deemed, without more debt to count or king,"
10038,XXXV,In place of either knight sufficed the ring.
10039,XXXV,
10040,XXXVI,XXXVI
10041,XXXVI,"In haste, they through the forest, here and there,"
10042,XXXVI,"So scorned of her, still gaze with stupid face;"
10043,XXXVI,Like questing hound which loses sight of hare
10044,XXXVI,"Or fox, of whom he late pursued the trace,"
10045,XXXVI,"Into close thicket, ditch, or narrow lair,"
10046,XXXVI,Escaping from the keen pursuer's chase.
10047,XXXVI,Meantime their ways the wanton Indian queen
10048,XXXVI,"Observes, and at their wonder laughs unseen."
10049,XXXVI,
10050,XXXVII,XXXVII
10051,XXXVII,"In the mid wood, where they the maid did lose,"
10052,XXXVII,"Was but a single pathway, left or right;"
10053,XXXVII,Which they believed the damsel could not choose
10054,XXXVII,"But follow, when she vanished from their sight."
10055,XXXVII,"Ferrau halts not, and Roland fast pursues,"
10056,XXXVII,Nor Sacripant less plies the rowels bright.
10057,XXXVII,"Angelica, this while, retrains her steed,"
10058,XXXVII,And follows the three warriors with less speed.
10059,XXXVII,
10060,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
10061,XXXVIII,When pricking thus they came to where the way
10062,XXXVIII,"Was in the forest lost, with wood o'ergrown,"
10063,XXXVIII,And had begun the herbage to survey
10064,XXXVIII,"For print of recent footsteps, up and down,"
10065,XXXVIII,"The fierce Ferrau, who might have borne away"
10066,XXXVIII,"From all that ever proudest were, the crown,"
10067,XXXVIII,"With evil countenance, to the other two"
10068,XXXVIII,"Turned him about, and shouted ""Whence are you?"""
10069,XXXVIII,
10070,XXXIX,XXXIX
10071,XXXIX,"""Turn back or take another road, save here,"
10072,XXXIX,"In truth, you covet to be slain by me."
10073,XXXIX,"Nor when I chase or woo my lady dear,"
10074,XXXIX,"Let any think I bear with company."""
10075,XXXIX,"And -- ""What more could he say, sir cavalier,"""
10076,XXXIX,"(Orlando cried to Sacripant) ""if we"

10078,XXXIX,"And reel from spindle-staff the matted wool?"""
10079,XXXIX,
10080,XL,XL
10081,XL,"Then turning to Ferrau,, ""But that thine head,"

10083,XL,"If thy late words were ill or wisely said,"
10084,XL,"Thou should'st perceive, before we further fare."""
10085,XL,"To him Ferrau:  ""For that which breeds no dread"
10086,XL,"In me, why should'st thou take such sovereign care?"
10087,XL,"What I have said unhelmed will I prove true,"

10102,XLII,"""As if, did I to wear a helm delight,"
10103,XLII,"You would not be without your casques of pride,"
10104,XLII,Already reft by me in your despite;

10106,XLII,"To wear no helm, and thus my promise quite;"
10107,XLII,"Roaming without, till that fine casque I win"

10116,XLIII,I warrant thou wouldst quake from head to feet;

10142,XLVI,"He ended, and his temples disarrayed,"
10143,XLVI,"And to a beech hung up the helmet good,"
10144,XLVI,And nigh as quickly bared his trenchant blade.
10145,XLVI,"Ferrau stands close, and in such attitude,"
10146,XLVI,(His courage not for what had chanced dismayed)
10147,XLVI,"Covered with lifted shield and naked sword,"

10156,XLVII,More fitted to be matched in fierce appeal:
10157,XLVII,"Equal their daring, equal was their might,"

10160,XLVIII,XLVIII
10161,XLVIII,"By you, fair sir, already, I presume,"
10162,XLVIII,"That fierce Ferrau was charmed is understood,"
10163,XLVIII,"Save where the child, enclosed within the womb"
10164,XLVIII,"Of the full mother, takes its early food;"
10165,XLVIII,"And hence he ever, till the squalid tomb"
10166,XLVIII,"Covered his manly face, wore harness good"

10175,XLIX,The rest than diamond dug from mountain hoar
10176,XLIX,"More hard, unless report from truth depart;"

10184,L,That stroke or thrust is never dealt in vain:
10185,L,Each mighty blow from Roland disengages
10186,L,"And loosens, breaks, or shatters, plate and chain."

10193,LI,When Ferrau and Orlando desperately
10194,LI,"Closing in fight were seen, his horse did gore"
10195,LI,Along the way by which he deemed that she
10196,LI,Had disappeared; and so that battle sore
10197,LI,"Was witnessed 'twixt the struggling foes, by none,"
10198,LI,Beside the daughter of king Galaphron.
10199,LI,
10200,LII,LII
10201,LII,After the damsel had sometime descried
10202,LII,"This dread and direful combat, standing nigh;"

10204,LII,"With equal peril both the warriors vie,"
10205,LII,"She, fond of novelty, the helm untied"
10206,LII,Designs to take; desirous to espy
10207,LII,What they would do when they perceived the wrong;

10209,LII,
10210,LIII,LIII
10211,LIII,"To give it to Orlando was she bent,"
10212,LIII,But first she would upon the warrior play:
10213,LIII,The helmet she took down with this intent
10214,LIII,"And in her bosom hid, and marked the fray:"
10215,LIII,"Next thence, without a word to either went,"
10216,LIII,And from the scene of strife was far away
10217,LIII,Ere either of the two had marked the feat;
10218,LIII,So were they blinded by their angry heat.
10219,LIII,
10220,LIV,LIV
10221,LIV,"But Ferrau, who first chanced the loss to see,"

10225,LIV,"What meed, which worthiest of the strife might be,"
10226,LIV,"If this be stolen, the victor shall abide?"""
10227,LIV,"Roland draws back, looks upward, and with ire,"
10228,LIV,"Missing the noble casque, is all on fire:"
10229,LIV,
10230,LV,LV
10231,LV,"And in opinion with Ferrau agreed,"
10232,LV,"That he the knight, who was with them before,"
10233,LV,Had born away the prize: hence turned his steed.
10234,LV,And with the spur admonished Brigliador.
10235,LV,"Ferrau, who from the field beheld him speed."
10236,LV,"Followed him, and when Roland and the Moor"
10237,LV,Arrived where tracks upon the herbage green
10238,LV,"Of the Circassian and the maid were seen,"
10239,LV,
10240,LVI,LVI
10241,LVI,Towards a vale upon the left the count
10242,LVI,"Went off, pursuing the Circassian's tread;"
10243,LVI,"The Spaniard kept the path more nigh the mount,"
10244,LVI,By which the fair Angelica had fled.
10245,LVI,"Angelica, this while, has reached a fount,"
10246,LVI,"Of pleasant site, and shaded overhead;"
10247,LVI,"By whose inviting shades no traveller hasted,"
10248,LVI,Nor ever left the chrystal wave untasted.
10249,LVI,
10250,LVII,LVII
10251,LVII,"Angelica, the sylvan spring beside,"
10252,LVII,"Reposes, unsuspicious of surprise;"
10253,LVII,"And thinking her the sacred ring will hide,"
10254,LVII,Fears not that evil accident can rise.
10255,LVII,"On her arrival at the fountain's side,"
10256,LVII,She to a branch above the helmet ties;
10257,LVII,"Then seeks the fittest sapling for her need,"
10258,LVII,"Where, fastened to its trunk, her mare may feed."
10259,LVII,
10260,LVIII,LVIII
10261,LVIII,The Spanish cavalier the stream beside
10262,LVIII,"Arrived, who had pursued her traces there:"
10263,LVIII,"Angelica no sooner him espied,"
10264,LVIII,"Than she evanished clean, and spurred her mare:"
10265,LVIII,"The helm this while had dropt, but lay too wide"
10266,LVIII,To be recovered of the flying fair.
10267,LVIII,"As soon as sweet Angelica he saw,"
10268,LVIII,Towards her full of rapture sprang Ferrau.
10269,LVIII,
10270,LIX,LIX
10271,LIX,"She disappeared, I say, as forms avaunt"
10272,LIX,At sleep's departure: toiling long and sore
10273,LIX,"He seeks the damsel there, 'twixt plant and plant,"
10274,LIX,Now can his wretched eyes behold her more.
10275,LIX,"Blaspheming his Mahound and Termagant,"
10276,LIX,"And cursing every master of his lore,"
10277,LIX,"Ferrau returned towards the sylvan fount,"
10278,LIX,Where lay on earth the helmet of the count.
10279,LIX,
10280,LX,LX
10281,LX,"This he soon recognised, for here he read"
10282,LX,"Letters upon the margin, written fair,"
10283,LX,Which how Orlando won the helmet said;
10284,LX,"And from what champion took, and when and where."
10285,LX,"With it the paynim armed his neck and head,"
10286,LX,Who would not for his grief the prize forbear;
10287,LX,"His grief for loss of her, conveyed from sight,"
10288,LX,As disappear the phantoms of the night.
10289,LX,
10290,LXI,LXI
10291,LXI,"When in this goodly casque he was arrayed,"
10292,LXI,"He deemed nought wanting to his full content,"
10293,LXI,"But the discovery of the royal maid,"
10294,LXI,Who like a flash of lightning came and went:
10295,LXI,"For her he searches every greenwood shade,"
10296,LXI,"And when all hope of finding her is spent,"
10297,LXI,"He for the vain pursuit no longer tarries,"
10298,LXI,But to the Spanish camp returns near Paris;
10299,LXI,
10300,LXII,LXII
10301,LXII,"Tempering the grief which glowed within his breast,"
10302,LXII,"For such sore disappointment, with the thought"
10303,LXII,"That he was with Orlando's morion blest,"
10304,LXII,"As sworn.  By good Anglante's count, when taught"
10305,LXII,"That the false Saracen the prize possest,"
10306,LXII,Long time the Spanish knight was vainly sought;
10307,LXII,"Nor Roland took the helmet from his head,"
10308,LXII,Till he between two bridges laid him dead.
10309,LXII,
10310,LXIII,LXIII
10311,LXIII,"Angelica thus, viewless and alone,"
10312,LXIII,"Speeds on her journey, but with troubled front;"
10313,LXIII,"Grieved for the helmet, in her haste foregone"
10314,LXIII,On her departure from the grassy fount.
10315,LXIII,"""Choosing to do what I should least have done,"""
10316,LXIII,"(She said) ""I took his helmet from the count."

10729,IX,"The flame, that in his constant bosom burned."
10730,IX,"He, save a way to have me with him, nought"
10731,IX,For solace of his restless passion sought.

10737,X,By stealth he purposed to elope with me.
10738,X,"Amid green fields, our wealthy town beside,"
10739,X,"I had a garden, seated by the sea,"
10740,X,Upon the pleasant shore; from whence the eye
10741,X,Might ocean and the hills about descry.

10743,XI,XI
10744,XI,"""A fitting place to effect what different creed"
10745,XI,"And law forbade us, he esteemed this site,"
10746,XI,"And showed the order taken for the deed,"
10747,XI,Which was to make our future life's delight;
10748,XI,"And how, near Santa Martha, for our need,"
10749,XI,"A bark was with arm'd men in ambush dight,"
10750,XI,Under Sir Odoric of Biscay's command;
10751,XI,"A leader he, approved by sea and land!"
10752,XI,
10753,XII,XII
10754,XII,"""Unable in his person this to do,"
10755,XII,For by his father he was forced to wend
10756,XII,"In succour of the king of France, in lieu"
10757,XII,This Odoric for the purpose he would send;
10758,XII,"Chosen, of all his faithful friends and true,"
10759,XII,As his most faithful and his truest friend:
10760,XII,"And such had been, if benefits could bind"
10761,XII,And goodly deeds the friendship of mankind.

10763,XIII,XIII
10764,XIII,"""At the time fixed to bear me thence away,"
10765,XIII,This chief would anchor on the destined ground.
10766,XIII,"-- And thus it was arrived the wished for day,"
10767,XIII,Then I of them was in my garden found.
10768,XIII,"Sir Odoric, at night, with fair array"
10769,XIII,"Of valiant men, by land and sea renowned,"
10770,XIII,"In the near river from his bark descends,"
10771,XIII,And thence in silence to my garden wends.

10774,XIV,"""To the pitched bark with me his party sped,"
10775,XIV,Before the city knew what was at hand;
10776,XIV,"Some of the house, disarmed and naked, fled,"
10777,XIV,"And some were slain; while of the helpless band,"
10778,XIV,"With me, another part was captive led."
10779,XIV,"So was I severed from my native land,"
10780,XIV,"Hoping in brief Zerbino to possess,"

10787,XV,And stirred and tost heaven-high the foaming tide.
10788,XV,"Smote with a north-west wind, next, ocean bubbled,"
10789,XV,Which on her other beam the vessel plied:
10790,XV,"This evermore increases, with such force,"

10798,XVI,"Save He, above, assist us at the last,"
10799,XVI,The cruel storm will us ashore impel;
10800,XVI,Driven thither by ill wind with mightier speed

10808,XVII,"Two follow, and a troop would throng the boat,"

10810,XVII,The entrance with their naked faulchions; we

10817,XVIII,Our goods sea-swallowed all.  Upon the strand
10818,XVIII,"To Eternal Love, To Goodness Infinite,"
10819,XVIII,"I offer up my thanks, with outstretched hand,"

10848,XXI,"Without more pause, in that lone desert, he"
10849,XXI,Would sate his greedy passion; but forbore

10858,XXII,To him (the Spaniard said) it were a slight
10859,XXII,If I unto Rochelle afoot should fare;

10868,XXIII,To the other finally his wicked will
10869,XXIII,Sir Odoric took courage to display;
10870,XXIII,"As well because he could not rid him thence,"

10877,XXIV,"From infancy, and the ungrateful wight"
10878,XXIV,"Deemed that the thought he harboured in his head,"
10879,XXIV,"He could impart in safety to the knight,"

10886,XXV,And termed him traitor; and by deed and word
10887,XXV,Withstood the purpose of his foul compeer.
10888,XXV,This mighty wrath in either warrior stirred;
10889,XXV,In sign whereof their naked brands they rear.
10890,XXV,"At sight of their drawn swords, in panic, I"

10898,XXVI,Love lent to him (unless I am misled)
10899,XXVI,"Pinions, that he might overtake his prey;"
10900,XXVI,"And many a prayer and glozing flattery taught,"

10994,XXXVI,"The brand discharged by him, hit either brow,"
10995,XXXVI,But most severely on the left did smite;
10996,XXXVI,"For that ill feature perished by the blow,"
10997,XXXVI,Which was the thief's sole minister of light.

13571,LXXIV,"Though it was noon in the happy islands, day"

13574,LXXIV,"And ill-discerned, were all things hid from sight;"
13575,LXXIV,When to the fort Orrilo took his way.
13576,LXXIV,Since both the sable sister and the white
13577,LXXIV,"Were pleased the furious battle to defer,"
13578,LXXIV,Till a new sun should in the horizon stir.

13581,LXXV,"The duke, who by their ensigns, and yet more"
13582,LXXV,"Had by the sight of many a vigorous blow,"
13583,LXXV,Gryphon and Aquilant long time before
13584,LXXV,"Agnized, to greet the brethren was not slow:"

13591,LXXVI,The ladies to repose the warriors led
13592,LXXVI,"To a fair palace near, their sumptuous seat:"
13593,LXXVI,"Thence issuing courtly squire and damsel sped,"
13594,LXXVI,Them with lit torches in mid-way to meet.
13595,LXXVI,"Their goodly steeds they quit, there well bested,"
13596,LXXVI,"Put off their arms, and in a garden sweet"
13597,LXXVI,Discern the ready supper duly laid

13600,LXXVII,LXXVII
13601,LXXVII,"Here they bid bind the giant on the green,"
13602,LXXVII,Fast-tethered by a strong and weighty chain
13603,LXXVII,"To a tough oak, whose ancient trunk they ween"
13604,LXXVII,May well be proof against a single strain;
13605,LXXVII,"With that, by ten good serjeants overseen,"
13606,LXXVII,"Lest he by night get loose, and so the train"
13607,LXXVII,Assault and haply harm; while careless they
13608,LXXVII,Without a guard and unsuspecting lay.

13610,LXXVIII,LXXVIII
13611,LXXVIII,"At the abundant and most sumptuous board,"
13612,LXXVIII,"With costly viands (its least pleasure) fraught,"
13613,LXXVIII,The longest topic for discourse afford
13614,LXXVIII,"Orrilo's prowess, and the marvel wrought;"
13615,LXXVIII,"For head or arm dissevered by the sword,"
13616,LXXVIII,They (who upon the recent wonder thought)
13617,LXXVIII,"Might think a dream to see him re-unite,"
13618,LXXVIII,And but return more furious to the fight.

13621,LXXIX,Astolpho in his book had found exprest
13622,LXXIX,(That which prescribed a remedy for spell)
13623,LXXIX,How he who of one hair deprived the pest
13624,LXXIX,Only could him in battle hope to quell:
13625,LXXIX,"But this plucked out or sheared, he from his breast"
13626,LXXIX,Parforce the felon's spirit would expell.
13627,LXXIX,"So says the volume; but instructs not where,"
13628,LXXIX,"'Mid locks so thickly set, to find the hair."

13631,LXXX,The duke no less with hope of conquest glows
13632,LXXX,Than if the palm he has already won;
13633,LXXX,As he that hopes with small expense of blows
13634,LXXX,"To pluck the hair, the wizard-wight undone."
13635,LXXX,Hence does he to the youthful pair propose
13636,LXXX,The burden of that enterprize upon
13637,LXXX,"Himself to take: Orrilo will he slay,"
13638,LXXX,"If the two brethren nought the intent gainsay,"
13639,LXXX,
13640,LXXXI,LXXXI
13641,LXXXI,"But willingly to him these yield the emprize,"
13642,LXXXI,Assured his toil will be bestowed in vain;
13643,LXXXI,"And now a new Aurora climbs the skies,"
13644,LXXXI,And from his walls Orrilo on the plain
13645,LXXXI,"Drops, -- and the strife begins -- Orrilo plies"
13646,LXXXI,"The mace, the duke the sword; he 'mid a rain"
13647,LXXXI,Of strokes would from the body at one blow
13648,LXXXI,Divorce the spirit of the enchanted foe:
13649,LXXXI,
13650,LXXXII,LXXXII
13651,LXXXII,Together with the mace he lops the fist;
13652,LXXXII,"And now this arm, now the other falls to ground;"
13653,LXXXII,"Sometimes he cleaves the corslet's iron twist,"
13654,LXXXII,And piecemeal shares and maims the felon round.
13655,LXXXII,"Orrilo re-unites the portions missed,"
13656,LXXXII,"Found on the champagne, and again is sound:"
13657,LXXXII,"And, though into a hundred fragments hewed,"
13658,LXXXII,"Astolpho sees him, in a thought, renewed."
13659,LXXXII,
13660,LXXXIII,LXXXIII
13661,LXXXIII,"After a thousand blows, Astolpho sped"
13662,LXXXIII,"One stroke, above the shoulders and below"
13663,LXXXIII,"The chin, which lopt away both helm and head:"
13664,LXXXIII,Nor lights the duke less swiftly than his foe.
13665,LXXXIII,"Then grasps the hair defiled with gore and red,"
13666,LXXXIII,"Springs in a moment on his horse, and lo!"
13667,LXXXIII,"Up-stream with it along Nile's margin hies,"
13668,LXXXIII,So that the thief cannot retake the prize.
13669,LXXXIII,
13670,LXXXIV,LXXXIV
13671,LXXXIV,"That fool, who had not marked the warrior's feat,"
13672,LXXXIV,Was searching in the dust to find his head;
13673,LXXXIV,"But when he heard the charger in retreat,"
13674,LXXXIV,"Who through the forest with the plunder fled,"
13675,LXXXIV,"Leapt quickly into his own courser's seat,"
13676,LXXXIV,And in pursuit of bold Astolpho sped.
13677,LXXXIV,"Fain had Orrilo shouted ""Hola!  stay!"""
13678,LXXXIV,But that the duke had borne his mouth away:
13679,LXXXIV,
13680,LXXXV,LXXXV

13685,LXXXV,This while the wizard's head Astolpho eyes
13686,LXXXV,"From poll to front, above the eyebrows twain,"
13687,LXXXV,"Searching, in haste, if he the hair can see"
13688,LXXXV,Which makes Orrilo's immortality.
13689,LXXXV,
13690,LXXXVI,LXXXVI
13691,LXXXVI,"Amid innumerable locks, no hair"
13692,LXXXVI,Straiter or crisper than the rest was seen.
13693,LXXXVI,"How then should good Astolpho, in his care"
13694,LXXXVI,"To slay the thief, so many choose between?"
13695,LXXXVI,"""To cut them all (he said) it better were."""
13696,LXXXVI,"And since he scissors lacked and razor keen,"
13697,LXXXVI,"He wanting these, resorted to his glaive,"
13698,LXXXVI,"Which cut so well, it might be said to shave."
13699,LXXXVI,
13700,LXXXVII,LXXXVII
13701,LXXXVII,"And, holding, by the nose, the severed head,"
13702,LXXXVII,"Close-sheared it all, behind and eke before."
13703,LXXXVII,"He found, among the rest, the fatal thread."
13704,LXXXVII,"Then pale became the visage, changing sore,"
13705,LXXXVII,"Turned up its eyes, and signals sore and dread"
13706,LXXXVII,Of the last agony of nature wore;
13707,LXXXVII,"And the headless body seated in the sell,"
13708,LXXXVII,"Shuddered its last, and from the courser fell."

13710,LXXXVIII,LXXXVIII
13711,LXXXVIII,The duke returns where he the champions two
13712,LXXXVIII,"And dames had left, the trophy in his hand,"

13714,LXXXVIII,And shows the distant body on the sand.
13715,LXXXVIII,"I know not if they this with pleasure view,"
13716,LXXXVIII,Though him they welcome with demeanour bland:
13717,LXXXVIII,For the intercepted victory might pain
13718,LXXXVIII,Perchance inflict upon the envying twain.

13968,VII,"Two ready knaves, who serve the warrior, rear"
13969,VII,The knightly helm and buckler at his side;
13970,VII,As one who with fair pomp and semblance went
13971,VII,"Towards Damascus, to a tournament."
13972,VII,
13973,VIII,VIII
13974,VIII,Damascus' king a splendid festival
13975,VIII,Had in these days bid solemnly proclaim;
13976,VIII,"And with what pomp they could, upon his call,"
13977,VIII,"Thither, in shining arms, the champions came."
13978,VIII,"At Gryphon's sight the harlot's spirits fall,"
13979,VIII,Who fears that he will work her scathe and shame;
13980,VIII,And knows her lover has not force and breath
13981,VIII,"To save her from Sir Gryphon, threatening death;"
13982,VIII,
13983,IX,IX
13984,IX,"But like most cunning and audacious quean,"
13985,IX,"Although she quakes from head to foot with fear,"
13986,IX,"Her voice so strengthens, and so shapes her mien,"
13987,IX,"That in her face no signs of dread appear,"
13988,IX,Having already made her leman ween
13989,IX,"The trick devised, she feigns a joyous cheer,"
13990,IX,"Towards Sir Gryphon goes, and for long space"
13991,IX,"Hangs on his neck, fast-locked in her embrace."
13992,IX,
13993,X,X
13994,X,"She, after suiting with much suavity"
13995,X,"The action to the word, sore weeping, cried:"
13996,X,"""Dear lord, is this the guerdon due to me,"
13997,X,For love and worship?  that I should abide
13998,X,"Alone one live long year, deprived of thee,"
13999,X,"-- A second near -- and, yet upon thy side"
14000,X,"No grief? -- and had I borne for thee to stay,"
14001,X,I know not if I should have seen that day.
14002,X,
14003,XI,XI
14004,XI,"""When I from Nicosia thee expected"
14005,XI,(When thou wast journeying to the plenar court)
14006,XI,"To cheer me, -- left with fever sore infected,"
14007,XI,"And in the dread of death, -- I heard report"
14008,XI,That thou wast gone to Syria; and dejected
14009,XI,"By that ill tiding, suffered in such sort,"
14010,XI,"I, all unable to pursue thy quest,"
14011,XI,Had nigh with this right hand transfixt my breast.
14012,XI,
14013,XII,XII
14014,XII,"""But fortune, by her double bounty, shows"
14015,XII,She guards me more than thou: me to convey
14016,XII,"She sent my brother here, who with me goes,"
14017,XII,My honour safe in his protecting stay;
14018,XII,"And this encounter with thee now bestows,"
14019,XII,"Which I above all other blessings weigh,"
14020,XII,"And in good time; for hadst thou longer stayed,"
14021,XII,"My lord, I should have died of hope delayed."""
14022,XII,

14024,XIII,"The wicked woman, full of subtlety"
14025,XIII,(Worse than a fox in crafty hardihood)
14026,XIII,"Pursues, and so well shapes her history,"
14027,XIII,She wholly throws the blame on Gryphon good;
14028,XIII,Makes him believe that other not to be
14029,XIII,"Her kin alone, but of her flesh and blood,"
14030,XIII,Got by one father; -- and so puts upon
14031,XIII,"The knight, that he less credits Luke and John."
14032,XIII,
14033,XIV,XIV
14034,XIV,"Nor he the fraud of her, more false than fair,"
14035,XIV,Only forbore with just reproach to pay;
14036,XIV,"Nor only did the threatened stranger spare,"
14037,XIV,Who was the lover of that lady gay;
14038,XIV,"But deemed to excuse himself sufficient were,"
14039,XIV,Turning some portion of the blame away;
14040,XIV,"And as the real brother she profest,"
14041,XIV,Unceasingly the lady's knight carest;
14042,XIV,
14043,XV,XV
14044,XV,"And to Damascus, with the cavalier"
14045,XV,"Returned, who to Sir Gryphon made report,"
14046,XV,"That Syria's wealthy king, with sumptuous cheer,"
14047,XV,Within that place would hold a splendid court;
14048,XV,"And who, baptized or infidel, appear"
14049,XV,"There at his tourney (of whatever sort),"
14050,XV,"Within the city and without, assures"
14051,XV,"From wrong, for all the time the feast endures."
14052,XV,
14053,XVI,XVI
14054,XVI,Yet I of Origilla's treachery
14055,XVI,"Shall not so steadfastly pursue the lore,"
14056,XVI,"Who, famed not for one single perfidy,"
14057,XVI,"Thousands and thousands had betrayed before,"
14058,XVI,But that I will return again to see
14059,XVI,Two hundred thousand wretched men or more
14060,XVI,"Burnt by the raging wild-fire, where they spread,"
14061,XVI,"About the walls of Paris, scathe and dread."
14062,XVI,
14063,XVII,XVII
14064,XVII,I left you where king Agramant prepared
14065,XVII,"To storm a gate, and to the assault was gone:"
14066,XVII,This he had hoped to find without a guard;
14067,XVII,And work elsewhere to bar the way was none.
14068,XVII,"For there, in person, Charles kept watch and ward"
14069,XVII,"With many, practised warriors every one;"
14070,XVII,"Two Angelines, two Guidos, Angelier,"
14071,XVII,"Avino, Avolio, Otho, and Berlinghier."

14073,XVIII,XVIII
14074,XVIII,"One and the other host its worth, before"
14075,XVIII,"Charles and king Agramant, desire to show,"
14076,XVIII,"Where praise, where riches are, they think, in store"
14077,XVIII,For those that do their duty on the foe.
14078,XVIII,But such were not the atchievements of the Moor
14079,XVIII,"As to repair the loss; for, to his woe,"
14080,XVIII,Full many a Saracen the champaign prest;
14081,XVIII,Whose folly was a beacon to the rest.
14082,XVIII,
14083,XIX,XIX
14084,XIX,"The frequent darts a storm of hail appear,"
14085,XIX,Which from the city-wall the Christians fling;
14086,XIX,"The deafening clamours put the heavens in fear,"
14087,XIX,"Which, from our part, and from that other, ring."
14088,XIX,But Charles and Agramant must wait; for here
14089,XIX,"I of the Mars of Africa will sing,"
14090,XIX,"King Rodomont, that fierce and fearful man,"
14091,XIX,That through the middle of the city ran.
14092,XIX,
14093,XX,XX
14094,XX,"I know not, sir, if you the adventure dread"
14095,XX,"Of that so daring Moor to mind recall,"
14096,XX,"The leader, who had left his people dead,"
14097,XX,Between the second work and outer wall;
14098,XX,"Upon those limbs the ravening fire so fed,"
14099,XX,"Was never sight more sad! -- I told withal,"
14100,XX,"How vaulting o'er that hindrance at a bound,"
14101,XX,He cleared the moat which girt the city round.
14102,XX,
14103,XXI,XXI
14104,XXI,"When he was known the thickening crowd among,"
14105,XXI,"By the strange arms he wore and scaly hide,"
14106,XXI,"There, where the aged sires and feebler throng."
14107,XXI,Listened to each new tale on every side;
14108,XXI,"Heaven-high groan, moan, and lamentation rung,"
14109,XXI,And loud they beat their lifted palms and cried:
14110,XXI,"While those who had the strength to fly aloof,"
14111,XXI,Sought safety not from house or temple's roof.
14112,XXI,
14113,XXII,XXII
14114,XXII,"But this the cruel sword concedes to few,"
14115,XXII,So brandished by that Saracen robust;
14116,XXII,"And here, with half a leg dissevered, flew"
14117,XXII,"A foot, there head divided from the bust:"
14118,XXII,"This cleft across, and that behold him hew,"
14119,XXII,"From head to hips, so strong the blow and just."
14120,XXII,"While, of the thousands wounded by the Moor,"
14121,XXII,Is none that shows an honest scar before.
14122,XXII,
14123,XXIII,XXIII
14124,XXIII,"What by weak herd, in fields of Hircany,"
14125,XXIII,"The tiger does, or Indian Ganges near,"
14126,XXIII,"Or wolf, by lamb or kid, on heights which lie"
14127,XXIII,"On Typheus' back, the cruel cavalier"
14128,XXIII,"Now executes on those, I will not, I"
14129,XXIII,"Call phalanxes or squadrons, but a mere"
14130,XXIII,"Rabble, that I should term a race forlorn,"
14131,XXIII,Who but deserved to die ere they were born.
14132,XXIII,
14133,XXIV,XXIV
14134,XXIV,"Of all he cuts, and thrusts, and maims, and bleeds,"
14135,XXIV,There is not one who looks him in the face.
14136,XXIV,"Throughout that street, which in a straight line leads"
14137,XXIV,"Up to St. Michael's bridge, so thronged a space,"
14138,XXIV,"Rodomont, terrible and fearful, speeds,"
14139,XXIV,"Whirling his bloody brand, nor grants he grace,"
14140,XXIV,"In his career, to servant or to lord;"
14141,XXIV,And saint and sinner feel alike the sword.
14142,XXIV,
14143,XXV,XXV
14144,XXV,Religion cannot for the priest bespeak
14145,XXV,"Mercy, nor innocence avail the child:"
14146,XXV,"Nor gently beaming eyes, nor vermeil cheek,"
14147,XXV,Protect the blooming dame or damsel mild.
14148,XXV,Age smites its breast and flies: while bent to wreak
14149,XXV,"Vengeance, the Saracen, with gore defiled,"
14150,XXV,"Shows not his valour more than cruel rage,"
14151,XXV,"Heedless alike of order, sex, and age."
14152,XXV,
14153,XXVI,XXVI
14154,XXVI,"Nor the impious king alone with human blood,"
14155,XXVI,"-- Lord of the impious he -- his hand distains,"
14156,XXVI,"But even on walls so sorely vents his mood,"
14157,XXVI,"He fires fair houses, and polluted fanes."
14158,XXVI,"The houses almost all were made of wood,"
14159,XXVI,"Then (as 'tis told) and this, by what remains,"
14160,XXVI,May be believed; for yet in Paris we
14161,XXVI,Six out of ten no better builded see.
14162,XXVI,
14163,XXVII,XXVII
14164,XXVII,"Though flames demolish all things far and wide,"
14165,XXVII,This ill appears his furious hate to slake:
14166,XXVII,"Where'er the paynim has his hands applied,"
14167,XXVII,He tumbles down a roof at every shake.
14168,XXVII,"My lord, believe, you never yet espied"
14169,XXVII,"Bombard in Padua, of so large a make,"
14170,XXVII,That it could rend from wall of battered town
14171,XXVII,"What, at a single pull, the king plucked down."

14174,XXVIII,"While the accursed man, amid the rout,"
14175,XXVIII,"So warred with fire and sword, if at his post,"
14176,XXVIII,"King Agramant had prest it from without,"
14177,XXVIII,The ample city had that day been lost.
14178,XXVIII,"But he was hindered by the warrior stout,"
14179,XXVIII,"Who came from England with the advancing host,"
14180,XXVIII,"Composed of English and of Scotch allied,"
14181,XXVIII,With Silence and the Angel for their guide.
14182,XXVIII,
14183,XXIX,XXIX
14184,XXIX,"It was God's will, that while through town and tower"
14185,XXIX,"The furious Rodomont such ruin spread,"
14186,XXIX,"Thither arrived Rinaldo, Clermont's flower."
14187,XXIX,"Three leagues above, he o'er the river's bed"
14188,XXIX,Had cast a bridge; from whence his English power
14189,XXIX,To the left-hand by crooked ways he led;
14190,XXIX,"That, meaning to assail the barbarous foes,"
14191,XXIX,The stream no obstacle might interpose.
14192,XXIX,
14193,XXX,XXX
14194,XXX,"Rinaldo had, with Edward, sent a force,"
14195,XXX,"Six thousand strong, of archer infantry,"
14196,XXX,"And sped, with Ariman, two thousand horse"
14197,XXX,Of lightest sort; and foot and cavalry
14198,XXX,"Sought Paris by those roads, which have their course"
14199,XXX,"Directly to, and from, the Picard sea;"
14200,XXX,"That by St. Martin's and St. Denys' gate,"
14201,XXX,They might convey the aid the burghers wait.
14202,XXX,
14203,XXXI,XXXI
14204,XXXI,Rinaldo sent with these the baggage train
14205,XXXI,"And carriages, with which his troops were stored;"
14206,XXXI,"And fetching, with the forces that remain,"
14207,XXXI,"A compass, he the upper way explored."
14208,XXXI,"He bridge, and boat, and means to pass the Seine,"
14209,XXXI,Had with him; for it here was ill to ford.
14210,XXXI,"He past his army, broke the bridges down,"
14211,XXXI,And rank'd in line the bands of either crown.
14212,XXXI,
14213,XXXII,XXXII
14214,XXXII,But having first the peers and captains wheeled
14215,XXXII,"About him in a ring, the cavalier"
14216,XXXII,"Mounted the bank which overtopt the field,"
14217,XXXII,"So much, that all might plainly see and hear;"
14218,XXXII,"And cried, ""My lords, you should thanksgiving yield,"
14219,XXXII,"With lifted hands, to God, who brought you here;"
14220,XXXII,"Through whom, o'er every nation, you may gain"
14221,XXXII,"Eternal glory, bought with little pain."

14247,XXXV,Nor speak I only of the nations near;
14248,XXXV,For city there is none on Christian ground.
14249,XXXV,But what has citizens beleaguered here;
14250,XXXV,"So that to you, for vanquishing the foe,"

14259,XXXVI,"And holy, enterprise should ill succeed,"
14260,XXXVI,"Believe me, only while these walls endure,"

14266,XXXVII,"Nor think that distance saves you from the Moor,"
14267,XXXVII,"Nor deem your island strong, the waves among."
14268,XXXVII,"For if, from far Gibraltar's straits of yore,"
14269,XXXVII,"And old Alcides' pillars, sailed the throng,"
14270,XXXVII,"To bear off plunder from your sea-girt strands,"
14271,XXXVII,What will they do when they possess our lands?

14274,XXXVIII,"""And, if in this fair enterprise arrayed,"
14275,XXXVIII,"No gain, no glory served you as a guide,"
14276,XXXVIII,"A common debt enjoins you mutual aid,"
14277,XXXVIII,Militant here upon one Church's side.
14278,XXXVIII,"Moreover, let not any be afraid,"
14279,XXXVIII,Our broken foemen will the assault abide;
14280,XXXVIII,"Who seem to me ill-taught in warlike art,"

14282,XXXVIII,
14283,XXXIX,XXXIX
14284,XXXIX,"Such reasons, and yet better for, that need"
14285,XXXIX,Might good Rinaldo in his speech infer;
14286,XXXIX,"And with quick phrase and voice, to valiant deed"
14287,XXXIX,The high-minded barons and bold army stir;
14288,XXXIX,And this was but to goad a willing steed
14289,XXXIX,(As the old proverb says) who lacks no spur.
14290,XXXIX,"He moved the squadrons, having closed his speech,"

14299,XL,"More inland, with a wider wheel to go."
14300,XL,"Thus England's horse and foot, the two between,"

14313,XLII,XLII
14314,XLII,With such a faithful escort fortified
14315,XLII,"And sure, the Christians who had thither wound,"
14316,XLII,"With Silence and the Angel for their guide,"
14317,XLII,No longer could stand mute or keep their ground:
14318,XLII,"But hearing now the foe, with shouts defied"
14319,XLII,"Their host, and made the shrilling trumpets sound;"
14320,XLII,"And with loud clamours, which Heaven's concave fill,"
14321,XLII,Sent through the paynim's bones a deadly chill.
14322,XLII,
14323,XLIII,XLIII
14324,XLIII,Rinaldo spurs before the troops combined
14325,XLIII,"His foaming courser, and his weapon rests;"
14326,XLIII,And a full bow-shot leaves the Scots behind:
14327,XLIII,So all delay the impatient peer molests.
14328,XLIII,As oftentimes an eddying gust of winds
14329,XLIII,"Issues, ere yet the horrid storm infests,"
14330,XLIII,"So sallying swiftly from the following herd,"
14331,XLIII,Rinaldo forth upon Baiardo spurred.
14332,XLIII,
14333,XLIV,XLIV
14334,XLIV,"As the aspect of the paladin of France,"
14335,XLIV,The wavering Moorish files betray their fear;
14336,XLIV,"And, trembling in their hands, is seen the lance,"
14337,XLIV,"Their thighs and stirrups quivering, like the spear."
14338,XLIV,"King Pulian only marks the knight's advance,"
14339,XLIV,"Knowing Rinaldo not, unchanged in cheer;"
14340,XLIV,"Nor thinking such a cruel shock to meet,"

14353,XLVI,XLVI
14354,XLVI,"Well-matched in skill, they aimed their cruel blows,"

14357,XLVI,"For this past on, and that the champaigne prest."
14358,XLVI,"More certain proof of worth, when warriors close,"
14359,XLVI,"There needs than knightly lance, well placed in rest;"
14360,XLVI,"But Fortune even more than Valour needs,"
14361,XLVI,"Which ill, without her saving succour, speeds."
14362,XLVI,

14364,XLVII,"With the good spear new levelled in his fist,"

14366,XLVII,"Of bulk, and bone, and sinew, to resist"
14367,XLVII,"The monarch was, but ill supplied with heart."
14368,XLVII,"And his might pass for a fair stroke in list,"
14369,XLVII,Though planted in the buckler's nether part.
14370,XLVII,"Let those excuse it who refuse to admire,"
14371,XLVII,Since the good paladin could reach no higher.
14372,XLVII,
14373,XLVIII,XLVIII
14374,XLVIII,"Nor did the buckler so the weapon stay,"

14376,XLVIII,"But that it pierced the paunch, and made a way"
14377,XLVIII,To let that mean and ill matched spirit out.
14378,XLVIII,"The courser, who had deemed that all the day"
14379,XLVIII,"He must so huge a burden bear about,"
14380,XLVIII,"Thanked in his heart the warrior, who well met,"
14381,XLVIII,Had thus preserved him from so sore a sweat.

14383,XLIX,XLIX
14384,XLIX,"Rinaldo, having broke his rested spear,"
14385,XLIX,"So wheels his horse, he seems equipt with wings;"
14386,XLIX,"Who, turning swiftly with the cavalier,"
14387,XLIX,"Amid the closest crowd, impetuous springs."
14388,XLIX,Composed of brittle glass the arms appear
14389,XLIX,Where Sir Rinaldo red Fusberta swings.
14390,XLIX,"Nor tempered steel is there, nor corslet thick,"
14391,XLIX,Which keeps the sword from biting to the quick.
14392,XLIX,
14393,L,L
14394,L,Yet few the tempered plates or iron pins
14395,L,With which encounters that descending brand;
14396,L,"But targets, some of oak and some of skins,"
14397,L,And quilted vest and turban's twisted band.
14398,L,"Lightly such drapery good Rinaldo thins,"
14399,L,"And cleaves, and bores, and shears, on either hand;"
14400,L,"Nor better from his sword escapes the swarm,"
14401,L,"Than grass from sweeping scythe, or grain from storm."
14402,L,
14403,LI,LI
14404,LI,"The foremost squadron had been put to flight,"
14405,LI,When thither the vanguard Zerbino led.
14406,LI,"Forth pricking from the following crowd, in sight"
14407,LI,"Appeared, with levelled lance, their youthful head:"
14408,LI,With no less fury those who trooped to fight
14409,LI,"Beneath his banner, to the combat sped;"
14410,LI,"Like lions, like so many wolves, who leap"
14411,LI,In fury to the assault of goat or sheep.
14412,LI,
14413,LII,LII
14414,LII,"Both spurred their coursers on, with rested lance,"
14415,LII,When either warrior to his foe was near;
14416,LII,"And that short interval, that small expanse,"
14417,LII,"Of plain, between, was seen to disappear."
14418,LII,Was never witnessed yet a stranger dance!
14419,LII,For the Scots only ply the murderous spear;
14420,LII,"Only the scattered paynims slaughtered lie,"
14421,LII,As if conducted thither but to die.
14422,LII,
14423,LIII,LIII
14424,LIII,It seemed as if each coward paynim grew
14425,LIII,"More cold than ice, each Scot more fierce than flame."
14426,LIII,The Moors believed that with Rinaldo's thew
14427,LIII,"And muscle fortified, each Christian came."
14428,LIII,"Sobrino quickly moved his ordered crew,"
14429,LIII,Nor stayed till herald should his call proclaim:
14430,LIII,"Better were they than those which went before,"
14431,LIII,"For captain, armour, and for martial lore."

14434,LIV,"Less worthless men of Africa were they,"

14436,LIV,"Ill harnessed, and worse trained to martial fray,"
14437,LIV,"Forthwith King Dardinel, the foe to assail,"
14438,LIV,"Moved up his host, himself in helmet gay,"
14439,LIV,And sheathing all his limbs in plate and mail.
14440,LIV,"The fourth division I believe was best,"

14453,LVI,LVI
14454,LVI,"The deep sonorous trumpet's bellowing,"

14456,LVI,"Combined with twang of bow, and whiz of sling,"
14457,LVI,"Wheel and machine, and stone from engine sent,"
14458,LVI,And (what more loud than these appeared to ring)
14459,LVI,"Tumult, and shriek, and groan, and loud lament,"
14460,LVI,Composed a direr whole than what offends
14461,LVI,The neighbouring tribes where deafening Nile descends.

14463,LVII,LVII
14464,LVII,The arrows' double shower the ample sky
14465,LVII,With wide-extended shade is seen to shrowd;
14466,LVII,"Breath, smoke of sweat and dust ascend on high,"
14467,LVII,And seem to stamp in air a murky cloud.
14468,LVII,"By turns each host gives way, and you might spy,"
14469,LVII,"Now chasing, now in flight, the self-same crowd;"
14470,LVII,"And here some wight, beside his foeman slain,"

14478,LVIII,Her mantle green for robe of crimson hue
14479,LVIII,"Earth shifts, ensanguined where the warriors course:"
14480,LVIII,"And there were azure flowers and yellow sprung,"

14484,LIX,Zerbino was more wonders seen to do
14485,LIX,"Than ever stripling of his age, he strowed"
14486,LIX,"The ground with heaps of dead, and overthrew"
14487,LIX,The paynim numbers which about him flowed.
14488,LIX,The valiant Ariodantes to his new-
14489,LIX,Entrusted squadron mighty prowess showed;
14490,LIX,"Filling with dread and wonder, near and far,"
14491,LIX,The squadrons of Castile and of Navarre.

14493,LX,LX
14494,LX,Chelindo and Mosco (bastards were the twain
14495,LX,"Of Calabrun, late king of Arragon),"
14496,LX,"And one esteemed among the valiant train,"
14497,LX,"Calamidor, of Barcellona's town,"
14498,LX,"Leaving their standards, in the hope to gain,"
14499,LX,"By young Zerbino's death, a glorious force,"
14500,LX,And wounded in his flanks the prince's horse.
14501,LX,
14502,LXI,LXI
14503,LXI,"Pierced by three lances lay the courser strong,"
14504,LXI,But bold Zerbino quickly rose anew;
14505,LXI,"And, eager to avenge his charger's wrong,"
14506,LXI,"The assailants, where he sees them, will pursue."
14507,LXI,"Zerbino at Mosco first, that overhung"
14508,LXI,"Him, in the hope to make him prisoner, flew,"
14509,LXI,"And pierced him in the flank; who from his sell,"

14512,LXII,LXII
14513,LXII,"When him so killed, as 'twere by stealthy blow,"
14514,LXII,"Chelindo viewed, to avenge his brother slain,"
14515,LXII,"He charged, intent the prince to overthrow;"
14516,LXII,"But he seized fast his courser by the rein,"
14517,LXII,"And, thence to rise not, laid the charger low,"
14518,LXII,Destined no more to feed on hay or grain;
14519,LXII,"For at one stroke, so matchless was his force,"
14520,LXII,Zerbino cleft the rider and his horse.
14521,LXII,
14522,LXIII,LXIII
14523,LXIII,"When that fell blow Calamidor espied,"
14524,LXIII,"He turned the bridle short to speed away,"
14525,LXIII,But him with downright cut Zerbino plied
14526,LXIII,"Behind, and cried withal, ""Stay, traitor, stay."""
14527,LXIII,"Nor from its aim the sword-stroke wandered wide,"
14528,LXIII,Though from the mark it went somedeal astray;
14529,LXIII,"The falchion missed the rider as he fled,"
14530,LXIII,"But reached the horse's croup, and stretched him dead,"
14531,LXIII,
14532,LXIV,LXIV
14533,LXIV,"He quits the horse, and thence for safety crawls;"
14534,LXIV,But he with little boot escapes his foe;
14535,LXIV,"For him Duke Thraso's horse o'erturns and mawls,"
14536,LXIV,Opprest the ponderous courser's weight below.
14537,LXIV,"Where the huge crowd upon Zerbino falls,"
14538,LXIV,Ariodantes and Lurcanio go;
14539,LXIV,"And with them many a cavalier and count,"
14540,LXIV,Who do their best Zerbino to remount.
14541,LXIV,
14542,LXV,LXV
14543,LXV,Then Artalico and Margano knew
14544,LXV,The force of Ariodantes' circling brand:
14545,LXV,While Casimir and Enearco rue
14546,LXV,More deeply yet the puissance of his hand.
14547,LXV,"Smote by the knight, escaped the former two;"
14548,LXV,The others were left dead upon the strand.
14549,LXV,Lurcanio shows what are his force and breath;
14550,LXV,"Who charges, smites, o'erturns, and puts to death."
14551,LXV,
14552,LXVI,LXVI
14553,LXVI,"Sir, think not that more inland on the plain"
14554,LXVI,The warfare is less mortal than along
14555,LXVI,"The stream, nor that the troops behind remain"
14556,LXVI,Which to the duke of Lancaster belong.
14557,LXVI,"He valiantly assailed the flags of Spain,"
14558,LXVI,And long in even scale the battle hung.
14559,LXVI,"For Horse and Foot, and Captains of those bands,"
14560,LXVI,"On either side, could deftly ply their hands."
14561,LXVI,
14562,LXVII,LXVII
14563,LXVII,Forward Sir Oldrad pricks and Fieramont;
14564,LXVII,"This Glocester's duke, and York's the other knight;"
14565,LXVII,"With them conjoined is Richard, Warwick's count,"
14566,LXVII,"And the bold duke of Clarence, Henry hight."
14567,LXVII,"These Follicon and Matalista front,"
14568,LXVII,"And Baricond, with all they lead to fight."
14569,LXVII,"Almeria this, and that Granada guides,"
14570,LXVII,And o'er Marjorca Baricond presides.
14571,LXVII,
14572,LXVIII,LXVIII
14573,LXVIII,Well matched awhile the Christian and the Moor
14574,LXVIII,"Appeared, without advantage in the fray."
14575,LXVIII,"Not this, now that gave ground, like corn before"
14576,LXVIII,The light and fickle breeze which blows in May:
14577,LXVIII,"Or as the sea which ripples on the shore,"
14578,LXVIII,"Still comes and goes, nor keeps one certain way,"
14579,LXVIII,"When hollow Fortune thus had sported long,"
14580,LXVIII,She proved disastrous to the paynim throng.
14581,LXVIII,
14582,LXIX,LXIX
14583,LXIX,The duke of Glocester Matalista bold
14584,LXIX,"Assailed this while, and hurtled from his sell;"
14585,LXIX,"Fieramont Follicon o'erturned and rolled,"
14586,LXIX,"In the right shoulder smit, on earth as well."
14587,LXIX,"The advancing English either paynim hold,"
14588,LXIX,And bear their prisoners off to dungeon cell.
14589,LXIX,"This while, Sir Baricond is, in the strife,"
14590,LXIX,By Clarence's bold duke deprived of life.
14591,LXIX,
14592,LXX,LXX
14593,LXX,"Hence 'tis among the Moors amazement all,"
14594,LXX,"While hence the Christians take such heart and pride,"
14595,LXX,"The bands do nought but quit their ground and fall,"
14596,LXX,"And break their order on the Paynim side,"
14597,LXX,"What time the Christian troops come on, and gall"
14598,LXX,"Their flying rants, which nowhere will abide:"
14599,LXX,And had not one arrived to aid their host.
14600,LXX,The Paynim camp had on that side been lost.
14601,LXX,
14602,LXXI,LXXI
14603,LXXI,"But Ferrau, who till this time ever nigh"
14604,LXXI,"Marsilius, scarce had quitted him that day,"
14605,LXXI,"When half destroyed he marked his chivalry,"
14606,LXXI,"And saw that baffled banner born away,"
14607,LXXI,"Pricked his good courser forth, in time to spy,"
14608,LXXI,(Where mid those squadrons hottest waxed the fray)
14609,LXXI,"With his head severed in a griesly wound,"
14610,LXXI,Olympio de la Serra fall to ground:
14611,LXXI,
14612,LXXII,LXXII
14613,LXXII,"A stripling he, who such sweet musick vented,"
14614,LXXII,Accorded to the horned lyre's soft tone;
14615,LXXII,That at the dulcet melody relented
14616,LXXII,"The hearer's heart, though harder than a stone."
14617,LXXII,"Happy!  if, with such excellence contented,"
14618,LXXII,"He had pursued so fair a fame alone,"
14619,LXXII,"And loathed shield, quiver, helmet, sword and lance;"
14620,LXXII,Destined by these to die a youth in France.
14621,LXXII,
14622,LXXIII,LXXIII
14623,LXXIII,"When bold French beheld his cruel plight,"
14624,LXXIII,"For whom he love and much esteem profest,"
14625,LXXIII,He felt more pity at the doleful sight
14626,LXXIII,"Than, 'mid those thousands slain, for all the rest."
14627,LXXIII,"And smote the foe who slew him with such might,"
14628,LXXIII,That he his helm divided from the crest;
14629,LXXIII,"Cut front, eyes, visage, and mid bosom through,"
14630,LXXIII,And cast him down amid the slaughtered crew.
14631,LXXIII,
14632,LXXIV,LXXIV
14633,LXXIV,"Nor stops he here, nor leaves a corslet whole,"
14634,LXXIV,"Nor helm unbroken, where his sword is plied,"
14635,LXXIV,"Of this the front or cheek, of that the poll,"
14636,LXXIV,The arm of other foe his strokes divide;
14637,LXXIV,"And he, of these divorcing body and soul,"
14638,LXXIV,Restores the wavering battle on that side;
14639,LXXIV,Whence the disheartened and ignoble throng
14640,LXXIV,"Are scattered wide, and broke, and driven along."
14641,LXXIV,
14642,LXXV,LXXV
14643,LXXV,"Into the medley pricks King Agramant,"
14644,LXXV,Desirous there his bloody course to run;
14645,LXXV,"With him King Baliverzo, Farurant,"
14646,LXXV,"Soridan, Bambirago, Prusion;"
14647,LXXV,"And next so many more of little vaunt,"
14648,LXXV,"Whose blood will form a lake ere day be done,"
14649,LXXV,That I could count each leaf with greater ease
14650,LXXV,When autumn of their mantle strips the trees.
14651,LXXV,
14652,LXXVI,LXXVI
14653,LXXVI,Agramant from the wall a numerous band
14654,LXXVI,"Of horse and foot withdraws, and sends the array"
14655,LXXVI,"Beneath the king of Fez, with a command"
14656,LXXVI,"Behind the Moorish tents to make his way,"
14657,LXXVI,"And those of Ireland in their march withstand,"
14658,LXXVI,"Whom he sees hurrying with what haste they may,"
14659,LXXVI,"And with wide wheel and spacious compass wind,"
14660,LXXVI,To fall upon the paynim camp behind.
14661,LXXVI,
14662,LXXVII,LXXVII
14663,LXXVII,The king of Fez upon this service prest;
14664,LXXVII,For all delay might sore his work impede.
14665,LXXVII,"This while King Agramant unites the rest,"
14666,LXXVII,And parts the troops who to the battle speed.
14667,LXXVII,"He sought himself the river, where he guessed"
14668,LXXVII,The Moorish host might most his presence need;
14669,LXXVII,"And, from that quarter, had a courier prayed,"
14670,LXXVII,"By King Sobrino sent, the monarch's aid."
14671,LXXVII,
14672,LXXVIII,LXXVIII
14673,LXXVIII,"He more than half his camp behind him led,"
14674,LXXVIII,In one deep phalanx.  At the mighty sound
14675,LXXVIII,"Alone, the Scotsmen trembled, and in dread"
14676,LXXVIII,"Abandoned honour, order, and their ground:"
14677,LXXVIII,"Lurcanio, Ariodantes, and their head,"
14678,LXXVIII,"Zerbino, there alone the torrent bound;"
14679,LXXVIII,"And haply he, who was afoot, had died,"
14680,LXXVIII,But that in time his need Rinaldo spied.
14681,LXXVIII,
14682,LXXIX,LXXIX
14683,LXXIX,Elsewhere the paladin was making fly
14684,LXXIX,A hundred banners: while the cavalier
14685,LXXIX,"So chased the quailing Saracens, the cry"
14686,LXXIX,Of young Zerbino's peril smote the ear;
14687,LXXIX,"For, single and afoot, his chivalry"
14688,LXXIX,Amid the Africans had left the peer.
14689,LXXIX,Rinaldo turned about and took his way
14690,LXXIX,Where he beheld the Scots in disarray.
14691,LXXIX,
14692,LXXX,LXXX
14693,LXXX,"He plants his courser, where their squadrons yield"
14694,LXXX,"To the fierce paynims, and exclaims:  ""Where go"
14695,LXXX,"Your bands, and why so basely quit the field,"
14696,LXXX,Yielding so vilely to so vile a foe?
14697,LXXX,"Behold the promised trophies, spear and shield,"
14698,LXXX,Spoils which your loaded churches ought to show!
14699,LXXX,"What praise!  what glory!  that alone, and reft"
14700,LXXX,"Of his good horse, your monarch's son is left!"
14701,LXXX,
14702,LXXXI,LXXXI
14703,LXXXI,"He from a squire receives a lance, and spies"
14704,LXXXI,"King Prusion little distant, sovereign"
14705,LXXXI,"Of the Alvaracchiae, and against him hies;"
14706,LXXXI,"Whom he unhorses, dead upon the plain."
14707,LXXXI,"So Agricalt, so Bambirago dies;"
14708,LXXXI,And next sore wounded is Sir Soridane;
14709,LXXXI,"Who had been slain as well amid the throng,"
14710,LXXXI,If good Rinaldo's lance had proved more strong.
14711,LXXXI,
14712,LXXXII,LXXXII
14713,LXXXII,"That weapon broken, he Fusberta rears,"
14714,LXXXII,"And smites Sir Serpentine, him of the star."
14715,LXXXII,Though charmed from mischief are the cavalier's
14716,LXXXII,"Good arms, he falls astounded by the jar,"
14717,LXXXII,And thus Rinaldo round Zerbino clears
14718,LXXXII,"The field so widely, where those champions war,"
14719,LXXXII,That without more dispute he takes a horse
14720,LXXXII,"Of those, who masterless, at random, course."
14721,LXXXII,
14722,LXXXIII,LXXXIII
14723,LXXXIII,"That he in time remounted it was well,"
14724,LXXXIII,"Who haply would not, if he more delayed:"
14725,LXXXIII,"For Agramant at once, and Dardinel,"
14726,LXXXIII,"Sobrino, and Balastro thither made;"
14727,LXXXIII,"But he, who had in time regained the sell,"
14728,LXXXIII,"Wheeled, here and there his horse, with brandished blade,"
14729,LXXXIII,"Dispatching into hell the mixt array,"
14730,LXXXIII,That how men live above their ghosts might say.
14731,LXXXIII,
14732,LXXXIV,LXXXIV
14733,LXXXIV,"The good Rinaldo, who to overthrow"
14734,LXXXIV,"The strongest of the foeman covets still,"
14735,LXXXIV,"At Agramant directs a deadly blow,"
14736,LXXXIV,"-- Who seems too passing-proud, and greater ill"
14737,LXXXIV,"Works there, than thousand others of the foe --"
14738,LXXXIV,"And spurs his horse, the Moorish chief to spill."
14739,LXXXIV,"He smote the monarch, broadside charged the steed,"
14740,LXXXIV,And man and horse reversed upon the mead.
14741,LXXXIV,
14742,LXXXV,LXXXV
14743,LXXXV,"What time, without, in such destructive frays"
14744,LXXXV,"Hate, Rage, and Fury, all offend by turns,"

14746,LXXXV,"And costly house, and holy temple burns:"
14747,LXXXV,"While Charles elsewhere anther duty stays,"
14748,LXXXV,"Who nothing hears of this, nor aught discerns."
14749,LXXXV,"He, in the town, receives the British band,"

14752,LXXXVI,LXXXVI
14753,LXXXVI,"To him a squire approached, who pale with dread,"
14754,LXXXVI,"Scarce drew his breath, and cried: ""Oh, well away!"
14755,LXXXVI,"Alas!  alas!""  (and thus he often said,"
14756,LXXXVI,"Ere he could utter aught beside).  ""To-day,"
14757,LXXXVI,"To-day, sire, is the Roman empire sped,"
14758,LXXXVI,And Christ to the heathen makes his flock a prey.
14759,LXXXVI,"A fiend from air to-day has dropt, that none"

15581,LXXVIII,"There golden Hermus and Pactolus are,"
15582,LXXVIII,"Mygdonia and Lydia: nor that country blest,"
15583,LXXVIII,"Which many tales for many praises note,"
15584,LXXVIII,"If thou wouldst thither wend, is too remote."
15585,LXXVIII,

15587,LXXIX,"Thou mighty Lion, that art charged to keep"
15588,LXXIX,"The keys of Paradise, a weighty care,"
15589,LXXIX,"Oh!  let not Italy lie plunged in sleep,"
15590,LXXIX,If thy strong hand is planted in her hair.
15591,LXXIX,"To thee, his shepherd, God, to guide his sheep,"
15592,LXXIX,Has given that wand and furious name to bear;
15593,LXXIX,"That thou may'st roar, and wide thine arms extend,"
15594,LXXIX,And so from greedy wolves thy flock defend.
15595,LXXIX,

15597,LXXX,But whither have I roved!  who evermore
15598,LXXX,So from one topic to the other stray?
15599,LXXX,Yet think not I the road I kept before
15600,LXXX,"To have missed so far, but I can find my way."
15601,LXXX,"I said, the Syrians then observed the lore"
15602,LXXX,Or arming like the Christians of that day.
15603,LXXX,So that Damascus' crowded square was bright
15604,LXXX,"With corslet, plate, and helm of belted knight."
15605,LXXX,
15606,LXXXI,LXXXI
15607,LXXXI,The lovely ladies from their scaffolds throw
15608,LXXXI,Upon the jousters yellow flowers and red;
15609,LXXXI,"While these, as loud the brazen trumpets blow,"
15610,LXXXI,Make their steeds leap and wheel and proudly tread.
15611,LXXXI,"Each, rode he well or ill, his art would show,"
15612,LXXXI,And with the goring spur his courser bled.
15613,LXXXI,"Hence this good cavalier earns fame and praise,"
15614,LXXXI,While others scornful hoots and laughter raise.
15615,LXXXI,
15616,LXXXII,LXXXII
15617,LXXXII,"A suit of arms was prize of the assay,"
15618,LXXXII,Presented to the king some days before;
15619,LXXXII,Which late a merchant found upon the way
15620,LXXXII,Returning from Armenia; this the more
15621,LXXXII,"To grace, a vest, with noblest tissue gay,"
15622,LXXXII,"The Syrian king subjoined, so powdered o'er"
15623,LXXXII,"With jewels, gold, and pearls in rich device,"
15624,LXXXII,They made the meed a thing of passing price.
15625,LXXXII,
15626,LXXXIII,LXXXIII
15627,LXXXIII,"If the good king had known the panoply,"
15628,LXXXIII,This he had held above all others dear;
15629,LXXXIII,"Nor this had given, as full of courtesy,"
15630,LXXXIII,To be contented for with sword and spear.
15631,LXXXIII,'Twere long to tell who so unworthily
15632,LXXXIII,"Had erst mistreated thus the goodly gear,"
15633,LXXXIII,"That lay the way the harness had been strowed,"
15634,LXXXIII,A prey to whosoever past the road.
15635,LXXXIII,
15636,LXXXIV,LXXXIV
15637,LXXXIV,Of this you more in other place shall hear.
15638,LXXXIV,"Of Gryphon now I tell, who at the just"
15639,LXXXIV,"Arrived, saw broken many a knightly spear,"
15640,LXXXIV,And more than one good stroke and one good thrust.
15641,LXXXIV,"Eight were there who made league together, dear"
15642,LXXXIV,"To Norandine, and held in sovereign trust;"
15643,LXXXIV,Youths quick in arms and practised in the shock:
15644,LXXXIV,"All lords, or scions of illustrious stock."
15645,LXXXIV,
15646,LXXXV,LXXXV
15647,LXXXV,"At open barriers, one by one, the place"
15648,LXXXV,They kept against all comers for a day;
15649,LXXXV,"At first with lance, and next with sword or mace,"
15650,LXXXV,While them the king delighted to survey.
15651,LXXXV,"Ofttimes they pierce the corslet's iron case,"
15652,LXXXV,"And every thing in fine perform in play,"
15653,LXXXV,"Which foemen do that deadly weapons measure,"
15654,LXXXV,Save that the king may part them at his pleasure.
15655,LXXXV,
15656,LXXXVI,LXXXVI
15657,LXXXVI,"That witless Antiochite, who, worthily,"
15658,LXXXVI,"By name was cowardly Martano hight,"
15659,LXXXVI,"Thinking, because his comrade, he must be"
15660,LXXXVI,"Partaker of the noble Gryphon's might,"
15661,LXXXVI,"Into the martial press rides valiantly,"
15662,LXXXVI,"Then stops; and the issue of a furious fight,"
15663,LXXXVI,"Which had begun between two cavaliers,"
15664,LXXXVI,"To wait, retiring from the strife, appears."
15665,LXXXVI,
15666,LXXXVII,LXXXVII
15667,LXXXVII,"Seleucia's lord, of those companions one,"
15668,LXXXVII,"Combined in that emprize to keep the place,"
15669,LXXXVII,"Who then a course with bold Ombruno run,"
15670,LXXXVII,"Wounded the unhappy warrior in mid-face,"
15671,LXXXVII,"So that he slew him; mourned by every one,"
15672,LXXXVII,"Who as a worthy knight the warrior grace,"
15673,LXXXVII,"And over and above his worth, before"
15674,LXXXVII,"All others, hold him for his courteous lore."
15675,LXXXVII,
15676,LXXXVIII,LXXXVIII
15677,LXXXVIII,When vile Martano from his place discerned
15678,LXXXVIII,"The fate which might be his with fearful eye,"
15679,LXXXVIII,"Into his craven nature be returned,"
15680,LXXXVIII,And straight began to think how he might fly:
15681,LXXXVIII,"But him from flight the watchful Gryphon turned,"
15682,LXXXVIII,"And, after much ado, with act and cry,"
15683,LXXXVIII,"Urged him against a knight upon the ground,"
15684,LXXXVIII,As at the ravening wolf men slip the hound.
15685,LXXXVIII,
15686,LXXXIX,LXXXIX
15687,LXXXIX,"Who will pursue the brindled beast for ten,"
15688,LXXXIX,"Or twenty yards, and, after, stop to bay;"
15689,LXXXIX,"When he beholds his flashing eyes, and when"
15690,LXXXIX,He sees the griesly beast his teeth display.
15691,LXXXIX,"'Twas thus, before those valiant gentlemen"
15692,LXXXIX,"And princes, present there in fair array,"
15693,LXXXIX,"Fearful Martano, seized with panic dread,"
15694,LXXXIX,Turned to the right his courser's rein and head.
15695,LXXXIX,
15696,XC,XC
15697,XC,"Yet he who would excuse the sudden wheel,"
15698,XC,Upon his courser might the blame bestow:
15699,XC,"But, after, he so ill his strokes did deal,"
15700,XC,Demosthenes his cause might well forego.
15701,XC,"With paper armed he seems, and not with steel,"
15702,XC,So shrinks he at the wind of every blow:
15703,XC,"At length he breaks the ordered champions through,"
15704,XC,Amid loud laughter from the circling crew.
15705,XC,
15706,XCI,XCI
15707,XCI,"Clapping of hands, and cries, at every turn,"
15708,XCI,Were heard from all that rubble widely spread.
15709,XCI,As a wolf sorely hunted makes return
15710,XCI,"To earth, to his retreat Martano fled."
15711,XCI,"Gryphon remained, and sullied with the scorn"
15712,XCI,"Esteemed himself, which on his mate was shed;"
15713,XCI,"And rather than be there, he, in his ire,"
15714,XCI,Would gladly find himself i' the midst of fire.
15715,XCI,
15716,XCII,XCII
15717,XCII,"With burning heart, and visage red with shame,"
15718,XCII,"He thinks the knight's disgrace is all his own,"
15719,XCII,"Because by deeds like his with whom he came,"
15720,XCII,He weens the mob expects to see him known.
15721,XCII,So that it now behoves his valour flame
15722,XCII,"More clear than light, or they, to censure prone,"
15723,XCII,-- Errs he a finger's breadth -- an inch -- will swell
15724,XCII,"His fault, and of that inch will make an ell."
15725,XCII,
15726,XCIII,XCIII
15727,XCIII,Already he the lance upon his thigh
15728,XCIII,"Has rested, little used to miss the foe:"
15729,XCIII,"Then makes with flowing rein his courser fly,"
15730,XCIII,"And next, somedeal advanced, directs the blow;"
15731,XCIII,"And, smiting, puts to the last agony"
15732,XCIII,"Sidonia's youthful lord, by him laid low."
15733,XCIII,"O'ercome with wonder each assistant rises,"
15734,XCIII,Whom sore the unexpected deed surprises.
15735,XCIII,
15736,XCIV,XCIV
15737,XCIV,"Gryphon returned, and did the weapon wield."
15738,XCIV,"Whole and recovered, which he couched before,"
15739,XCIV,And in three pieces broke it on the shield
15740,XCIV,Which bold Laodicea's baron bore.
15741,XCIV,Thrice of four times about to press the field
15742,XCIV,"He seemed, and lay along the crupper, sore"
15743,XCIV,"Astound; yet rose at length, unsheathed his blade,"
15744,XCIV,"Wheeled his good courser, and at Gryphon made."
15745,XCIV,
15746,XCV,XCV
15747,XCV,"Gryphon, who in his saddle sees the peer"
15748,XCV,"Advancing towards him, nor unseated by"
15749,XCV,"The encounter, says: ""The failure of the spear"
15750,XCV,"In a few strokes the sabre shall supply;"""
15751,XCV,"And on his temples smote a stroke so shear,"
15752,XCV,It seemed that it descended from the sky;
15753,XCV,"And matched it with another, and again"
15754,XCV,"Another, till he stretched him on the plain."
15755,XCV,
15756,XCVI,XCVI
15757,XCVI,"Here two good brothers of Apamia were,"
15758,XCVI,In tourney wont to have the upper hand:
15759,XCVI,Corimbo named and Thyrsis was the pair;
15760,XCVI,Both overturned by Gryphon on the land.
15761,XCVI,"One at the encounter left his saddle bare,"
15762,XCVI,On the other Gryphon used his trenchant brand:
15763,XCVI,"This valiant knight, was, in the common trust,"
15764,XCVI,Sure to obtain the honours of the just.
15765,XCVI,
15766,XCVII,XCVII
15767,XCVII,"Bold Salinterno, mid the warlike train,"
15768,XCVII,"Was in the lists, vizier and marshal hight,"
15769,XCVII,"Who had the government of all that reign,"
15770,XCVII,"And was, withal, a puissant man of might:"
15771,XCVII,"The tourney's prize he sees, with much disdain,"
15772,XCVII,About to be borne off by foreign knight.
15773,XCVII,"A lance he snatches, and to Gryphon cries,"
15774,XCVII,And him with many menaces defies.
15775,XCVII,
15776,XCVIII,XCVIII
15777,XCVIII,"But he makes answer with a massy spear,"
15778,XCVIII,Out of ten others chosen as the best;
15779,XCVIII,"And levelling at the buckler of the peer,"
15780,XCVIII,"For greater surety, pierces plate and breast."
15781,XCVIII,"'Twixt rib and rib, it bored the cavalier,"
15782,XCVIII,"Issuing a palm behind.  To all the rest,"
15783,XCVIII,"The king excepted, welcome was the blow:"
15784,XCVIII,For each was greedy Salinterno's foe.
15785,XCVIII,
15786,XCIX,XCIX
15787,XCIX,"Two of Damascus next Sir Gryphon sped,"
15788,XCIX,"Hermophilo and Carmondo.  This, arraid"
15789,XCIX,"Under his flag, the king's militia led;"
15790,XCIX,That was as lord high admiral obeyed.
15791,XCIX,"This lightly at the shock on earth was shed,"
15792,XCIX,"And that, reversed, upon the ground o'erlaid"
15793,XCIX,"By his weak horse, too feeble to withstand"
15794,XCIX,Sir Gryphon's mighty push and puissant hand.
15795,XCIX,
15796,C,C
15797,C,"Yet in the field remained Seleucia's knight,"
15798,C,The best of all the other seven at need;
15799,C,And one who well accompanied his might
15800,C,With perfect armour and a gallant steed.
15801,C,"Both at the helmet, where it locks, take sight,"
15802,C,And with their spears to the encounter speed:
15803,C,"But Gryphon hardest smote, whose paynim foe"
15804,C,"Lost his left stirrup, staggered by the blow."
15805,C,
15806,CI,CI
15807,CI,"They cast the truncheons down, their coursers wheel,"
15808,CI,"And, full of daring, with drawn falchions close."
15809,CI,"Sir Gryphon was the first a stroke to deal,"
15810,CI,Which might have split an anvil; at the blow's
15811,CI,"Descent, the shield is splintered -- bone and steel --"
15812,CI,This had its lord mid thousand others chose;
15813,CI,"And, but 'twas double, and the coat as well,"
15814,CI,The sword had cleft the thigh on which it fell.
15815,CI,
15816,CII,CII
15817,CII,"He of Seleucia at Sir Gryphon's casque,"
15818,CII,"At the same time, so fell a blow addrest,"
15819,CII,"It would have rent and torn the iron mask,"
15820,CII,Had it not been enchanted like the rest.
15821,CII,"The paynim's labour is a fruitless task,"
15822,CII,Of arms so hard Sir Gryphon is possest;
15823,CII,Who has the foe's already cleft and broke
15824,CII,"In many parts, nor thrown away a stroke."
15825,CII,
15826,CIII,CIII
15827,CIII,Each one might see how much Seleucia's lord
15828,CIII,"Was overmatched by Gryphon, and that day,"
15829,CIII,"The worsted men had perished by the sword,"
15830,CIII,Had not the monarch quickly stopt the fray.
15831,CIII,"To his guard king Norandino spake the word,"
15832,CIII,"And bade them enter, and the duel stay:"
15833,CIII,"They part the knight, whom they asunder bear,"
15834,CIII,And much the king is lauded for his care.
15835,CIII,
15836,CIV,CIV
15837,CIV,"The eight, who had to keep the field pretended"
15838,CIV,"From all the world, nor yet their part had done"
15839,CIV,"On a sole knight, -- their quarrel ill defended, --"
15840,CIV,Had vanished from the tilt-yard one by one.
15841,CIV,"The others, who with them should have contended,"
15842,CIV,Stood idle; for to answer them was none.
15843,CIV,"Since Gryphon had forestalled, in the debate,"
15844,CIV,What they should all have done against those eight;
15845,CIV,
15846,CV,CV
15847,CV,"And, for such little time endured the play,"
15848,CV,Less than an hour sufficed to finish all.
15849,CV,"But Norandine, the pastime to delay,"
15850,CV,"And to continue it till even-fall,"
15851,CV,"Descending from his place, bade clear the way;"
15852,CV,"And the huge squad divided, at his call,"
15853,CV,"Into two troops, whom, ranked by blood and might,"
15854,CV,"The monarch formed, and marched for other fight."
15855,CV,
15856,CVI,CVI
15857,CVI,"Sir Gryphon, during this, had made return"
15858,CVI,"Homeward, with anger and with fury stung;"
15859,CVI,Less thinking of his honours that the scorn
15860,CVI,Which on the vile Martano had been flung.
15861,CVI,"Hence, from himself the opprobrious shame to turn,"
15862,CVI,Martano now employs his lying tongue;
15863,CVI,"And she, the false and cunning courtezan,"
15864,CVI,Assists him in his scheme as best she can.
15865,CVI,
15866,CVII,CVII
15867,CVII,"Whether the youth believed the tale or no,"
15868,CVII,"He the excuse received, like one discreet;"
15869,CVII,"And deemed it best for them at once to go,"
15870,CVII,"And secretly and silently retreat,"
15871,CVII,"For fear, that if the populace should know"
15872,CVII,"Martano base, they him might ill entreat."
15873,CVII,"So, by short ways and close, they quit the abode,"
15874,CVII,And issue from the gates upon their road.
15875,CVII,
15876,CVIII,CVIII
15877,CVIII,"Sir Gryphon, was he or his horse foredone"
15878,CVIII,"With toil, or was it sleep his eyes down weighed,"
15879,CVIII,"Ere yet the troop beyond two miles had gone,"
15880,CVIII,At the first inn upon the highway stayed.
15881,CVIII,"He doffed his armour all, and morion,"
15882,CVIII,And had the steeds of trappings disarrayed;
15883,CVIII,"And next alone he to a chamber sped,"
15884,CVIII,"Locked himself in, undrest, and went to bed."
15885,CVIII,
15886,CIX,CIX
15887,CIX,"No sooner he his head had rested there,"
15888,CIX,"Than, with deep sleep opprest, he closed his eye:"
15889,CIX,"So heavily, no badgers in their lair,"
15890,CIX,"Or dormice, overcome with slumber, lie."
15891,CIX,"Martano and Origille, to take the air,"
15892,CIX,Entered this while a garden which was nigh;
15893,CIX,"And there the strangest fraud together bred,"
15894,CIX,Which ever entered into mortal head.
15895,CIX,
15896,CX,CX
15897,CX,Martano schemed to take away the steed
15898,CX,"And gear, in which Sir Gryphon had been dight,"
15899,CX,"And stand before the monarch, in the weed"
15900,CX,Of him who had in joust so proved his might.
15901,CX,"As he had shaped in thought, he did the deed:"
15902,CX,"He took away the warrior's horse, more white"
15903,CX,"Than milk, his buckler, surcoat, arms, and crest;"
15904,CX,In all Sir Gryphon's knightly ensigns drest.
15905,CX,
15906,CXI,CXI
15907,CXI,"He, who was clad in trappings not his own,"
15908,CXI,"Like the ass mantled in the lion's hide,"
15909,CXI,"As he expected, to the king, unknown,"
15910,CXI,Was called in place of Gryphon: when descried
15911,CXI,"Or Norandine, he rising from his throne,"
15912,CXI,"Embraced and kissed, and placed him by his side:"
15913,CXI,"Nor deems enough to praise and hold him dear,"
15914,CXI,But wills that all around his praise should hear:
15915,CXI,
15916,CXII,CXII
15917,CXII,"And bids them the sonorous metal blow,"
15918,CXII,Proclaiming him the conqueror of that day:
15919,CXII,"And round about loud voices, high and low,"
15920,CXII,The unworthy name throughout the lists convey.
15921,CXII,"He wills that, side by side, with him shall go"
15922,CXII,"The knight, when homeward he shall take his way;"
15923,CXII,"And him such favour shows, intent to please,"
15924,CXII,As might have honoured Mars or Hercules.
15925,CXII,
15926,CXIII,CXIII
15927,CXIII,"Him lodgings fair he gave, wherein to dwell"
15928,CXIII,At court; and she who with the peer did ride
15929,CXIII,"Was honoured by the courteous king as well,"
15930,CXIII,"-- False Origille, -- with knight and page supplied."
15931,CXIII,But it is time that I of Gryphon tell;
15932,CXIII,"Who unsuspecting, she, or wight beside,"
15933,CXIII,"Him would with treacherous stratagem deceive,"
15934,CXIII,"Had fallen asleep, nor ever waked till eve."
15935,CXIII,
15936,CXIV,CXIV
15937,CXIV,"When he how late it was, awaking, knew,"
15938,CXIV,With speed he from the chamber did withdraw;
15939,CXIV,"And hastened where he, with the other crew,"
15940,CXIV,Left Origille and her false brother-in-law:
15941,CXIV,"And when, nor these, nor, upon better view,"
15942,CXIV,"His armour nor his wonted clothes he saw,"
15943,CXIV,Suspicious waxed; and more suspicion bred
15944,CXIV,The ensigns of his comrade left instead.
15945,CXIV,
15946,CXV,CXV
15947,CXV,"The host, arriving, him at full possest"
15948,CXV,"Of every thing, -- and how, in white array,"
15949,CXV,"That warrior, with the lady and the rest,"
15950,CXV,Had to the city measured back their way.
15951,CXV,"By little and by little, Gryphon guessed"
15952,CXV,What love from him had hidden till that day;
15953,CXV,"And knew, to his great sorrow, in the other"
15954,CXV,"Origille's paramour, and not her brother."
15955,CXV,
15956,CXVI,CXVI
15957,CXVI,"Now he lamenting for his folly stood,"
15958,CXVI,"That having heard the truths the pilgrim said,"
15959,CXVI,"He should have let her story change his mood,"
15960,CXVI,Who him before so often had betrayed.
15961,CXVI,"He might have venged himself, nor did: -- now wou'd,"
15962,CXVI,"Too late, inflict the punishment delaid;"
15963,CXVI,Constrained (a crying error!) in his need
15964,CXVI,To take that wily treachour's arms and steed.
15965,CXVI,
15966,CXVII,CXVII
15967,CXVII,"He better would have gone like naked man,"
15968,CXVII,Than braced the unworthy cuirass on his breast;
15969,CXVII,"Or hastened the detested shield to span,"
15970,CXVII,Or place upon his helm the scorned crest.
15971,CXVII,"But of the lover, and that courtezan,"
15972,CXVII,"He, passion mastering reason, took the quest:"
15973,CXVII,"And bending to Damascus' gate his way,"

15975,CXVII,
15976,CXVIII,CXVIII
15977,CXVIII,On the left hand a castle richly dight
15978,CXVIII,"Stood nigh the gate, to which Sir Gryphon rode."
15979,CXVIII,"Besides, that it was strong and armed for fight,"
15980,CXVIII,Filled with rare chambers was the rich abode.
15981,CXVIII,"The first of Syria, king, and lord, and knight,"
15982,CXVIII,"And lady, in a gentle group bestowed,"
15983,CXVIII,"There in an open gallery fairly met,"
15984,CXVIII,Were at their glad and costly supper set.

15986,CXIX,CXIX
15987,CXIX,"With the high tower the beauteous gallery, clear"
15988,CXIX,"Beyond the city-wall, projected out,"
15989,CXIX,"From whence might be discovered, far and near,"
15990,CXIX,The spacious fields and different roads about.
15991,CXIX,"When Gryphon now, in his opprobrious gear,"
15992,CXIX,"And arms, dishonoured by the rabble's flout,"
15993,CXIX,"Makes, by ill fortune, to the gate resort,"
15994,CXIX,"He by the king is seen, and all his court;"
15995,CXIX,
15996,CXX,CXX
15997,CXX,"And, taken for the man whose crest he wears,"
15998,CXX,"In dame and knight moves laughter, through the ring."
15999,CXX,"The vile Martano, as a man who shares"
16000,CXX,"The royal grace, sits next below the king;"
16001,CXX,"And next, she, whom her love so fitly pairs;"
16002,CXX,Whom Norandino gaily questioning.
16003,CXX,"Demands of them, who is the coward knight,"
16004,CXX,That of his honour makes so passing light;
16005,CXX,
16006,CXXI,CXXI
16007,CXXI,"Who, after feat so base and foul, anew"
16008,CXXI,"Approaches, with such front and shameless cheer,"
16009,CXXI,"-- And cries, ""It seems a thing unheard, that you,"
16010,CXXI,"An excellent and worthy cavalier,"
16011,CXXI,"Should take this man for your companion, who"
16012,CXXI,Has not in all our wide Levant his peer.
16013,CXXI,"Did you with him for contrast-sake combine,"

16020,CXXII,As I am wont to make his fellows share:
16021,CXXII,Him would I make of my long-nursed disdain
16022,CXXII,Of cowardice perpetual record bear.
16023,CXXII,"To you, by whom he hither was conveyed,"

16060,CXXVI,That they should cost the stranger knight his head:
16061,CXXVI,"Enough that he again the people glad,"
16062,CXXVI,"For penance of his weighty sin.""  This said,"
16063,CXXVI,"He quickly called a baron of his crew,"
16064,CXXVI,And him enjoined the deed he was to do.
16065,CXXVI,
16066,CXXVII,CXXVII
16067,CXXVII,"With many armed men that baron fares,"
16068,CXXVII,"And to the city-gate descending, here"

16070,CXXVII,Waiting the coming of the cavalier;
16071,CXXVII,"And him surprises so at unawares,"
16072,CXXVII,"He, softly, 'twixt two bridges, takes the peer;"
16073,CXXVII,"And him detains, with mockery and scorn,"
16074,CXXVII,"In a dark chamber, till returning morn."

16077,CXXVIII,The early sun had scarce his golden hair
16078,CXXVIII,"Uplifted from his ancient nurse's breast,"
16079,CXXVIII,"Beginning, upon Alpine regions bare,"
16080,CXXVIII,"To chase the shades and gild the mountain-crest,"
16081,CXXVIII,"When Martan', fearing Gryphon might declare"
16082,CXXVIII,"His wrong, and to the king the truth attest,"
16083,CXXVIII,"Retorting upon him the slander cast,"
16084,CXXVIII,"Took leave, and thence upon his journey past."
16085,CXXVIII,

16088,CXXIX,"Why he stays not, to see the recreant shown."
16089,CXXIX,"He is with other gifts, beside the prize,"
16090,CXXIX,"Rewarded for the victory, not his own,"
16091,CXXIX,"And letters patent, drawn in ample wise,"
16092,CXXIX,Wherein his lofty honours wide are blown.

16383,XXIII,"And stained anew his falchion, by whose blade"
16384,XXIII,More than a hundred deadly wounds were given.
16385,XXIII,"But reason, finally, his fury stayed"
16386,XXIII,Before the bloody carnage stank to heaven;
16387,XXIII,"And he, with better counsel, from the side"
16388,XXIII,Cast himself down into Seine's foaming tide.
16389,XXIII,
16390,XXIV,XXIV
16391,XXIV,"Athwart the current swam, with arms and all,"
16392,XXIV,"As if by corks upborn, the cavalier."
16393,XXIV,"Though thou Antaeus bred'st, and Hannibal,"
16394,XXIV,O Africa!  thou never bred'st his peer! --
16395,XXIV,"When now across the stream, without the wall,"
16396,XXIV,"He turned, and saw the royal town appear,"
16397,XXIV,"-- To have traversed all the city moved his ire,"
16398,XXIV,Leaving it undestroyed by sword or fire;
16399,XXIV,
16400,XXV,XXV
16401,XXV,"And him so sorely anger stung and pride,"
16402,XXV,Thither he thought a second time to go;
16403,XXV,"And from his inmost bosom groaned and sighed,"
16404,XXV,Nor would depart until he laid it low.
16405,XXV,But he saw one along the river-side
16406,XXV,"Approach, who made him rage and hate forego;"
16407,XXV,"Strait shall you hear who 'twas, approached the king,"
16408,XXV,But first I have to say of other thing.
16409,XXV,
16410,XXVI,XXVI
16411,XXVI,"I have of haughty Discord now to say,"
16412,XXVI,"To whom the archangel Michael gave command,"
16413,XXVI,To heat to enmity and fierce affray
16414,XXVI,The best of Agramant's besieging band.
16415,XXVI,"She went that evening from the abbey gray,"
16416,XXVI,Her task committing to another's hand;
16417,XXVI,"-- Left it to Fraud to feed, till her return,"
16418,XXVI,"The war, and make the fires she kindled burn;"
16419,XXVI,
16420,XXVII,XXVII
16421,XXVII,"And she believed, that she with greater power"
16422,XXVII,"Should go, did Pride with her as well repair;"
16423,XXVII,And she (for all were guested in one bower)
16424,XXVII,In search of her had little way to fare.
16425,XXVII,"Pride went with her; but, that in hall or tower,"
16426,XXVII,"A vicar too her charge might duly bear,"
16427,XXVII,"She for those days she absent thought to be,"
16428,XXVII,For her lieutenant left Hypocrisy.
16429,XXVII,
16430,XXVIII,XXVIII
16431,XXVIII,"The implacable Discord went, and with the dame,"
16432,XXVIII,"(Companion of the enterprise, was Pride)"
16433,XXVIII,"Upon her road; and found that, by the same,"
16434,XXVIII,"Was journeying to the paynim camp, beside,"
16435,XXVIII,"Comfortless Jealousy, with whom there came"
16436,XXVIII,"A little dwarf, attending as a guide;"
16437,XXVIII,Who erst had been sent forward with advice
16438,XXVIII,"To Sarza's king, by beauteous Doralice."
16439,XXVIII,
16440,XXIX,XXIX
16441,XXIX,"When she fell into Mandricardo's hand,"
16442,XXIX,(I have before recounted when and where)
16443,XXIX,"She had in secret given the dwarf command,"
16444,XXIX,He to the king should with the tidings fare;
16445,XXIX,By whom she hoped not vainly would be scanned
16446,XXIX,"The tale her messenger was charged to bear,"
16447,XXIX,"But wonderous deeds be done for her relief,"
16448,XXIX,With sad and signal vengeance on the thief.
16449,XXIX,
16450,XXX,XXX
16451,XXX,"Jealousy had that little dwarf espied,"
16452,XXX,"And kenned the reason of his mission too,"
16453,XXX,"And joined him, journeying with him side by side,"
16454,XXX,Deeming that she therein a part might do.
16455,XXX,"Discord, with pleasure, Jealousy decried,"
16456,XXX,"But with more joy, when she the occasion knew"
16457,XXX,"Which thither brought the dame, who much (she wist)"
16458,XXX,Might in the task she had in hand assist.
16459,XXX,
16460,XXXI,XXXI
16461,XXXI,Of means to embroil the Sarzan and the son
16462,XXXI,"Of Agrican, she deems herself possest."
16463,XXXI,A certain mode to enrage these two is won;
16464,XXXI,And other means may work upon the rest.
16465,XXXI,"She thither with the dwarfish page is gone,"
16466,XXXI,Where the fierce Pagan in his clutch had prest
16467,XXXI,"Proud Paris, and they reached the river strand,"
16468,XXXI,Exactly as the felon swam to land.
16469,XXXI,
16470,XXXII,XXXII
16471,XXXII,As soon as the redoubted Rodomont
16472,XXXII,"Knew in the dwarf the courier of his dame,"
16473,XXXII,"He all his rage extinguished, cleared his front,"
16474,XXXII,And felt his courage brighten into flame.
16475,XXXII,"All else he deems the courier may recount,"
16476,XXXII,"Save that a wight had wrought him scaith and shame,"
16477,XXXII,And cries (encountering him with chearful brow)
16478,XXXII,"""How fares our lady?  wither sent art thou?"""
16479,XXXII,
16480,XXXIII,XXXIII
16481,XXXIII,"""Nor mine nor thine that lady will I say,"
16482,XXXIII,"Who is another's thrall,"" the dwarf replied."
16483,XXXIII,"""We, on our road, encountered yesterday"
16484,XXXIII,"A knight, who seized and bore away the bride."""
16485,XXXIII,"Jealousy, upon this, took up the play,"
16486,XXXIII,"And, cold as asp, embraced the king: her guide"
16487,XXXIII,"Pursued his tale, relating how the train,"
16488,XXXIII,"Their mistress taken, by one man were slain."
16489,XXXIII,
16490,XXXIV,XXXIV
16491,XXXIV,"Her flint and steel, fell Discord, as he said,"
16492,XXXIV,"Took forth, and somewhile hammered on the stone."
16493,XXXIV,"Pride, underneath, the ready tinder spread,"
16494,XXXIV,And the quick fire was in a moment blown:
16495,XXXIV,"This on the paynim's soul so fiercely fed,"
16496,XXXIV,He could not find a resting place: 'mid groan
16497,XXXIV,"And sob he storms, with horrid face and eye,"
16498,XXXIV,Which threat the elements and ample sky.
16499,XXXIV,
16500,XXXV,XXXV
16501,XXXV,"As tiger rages, who in vain descends"
16502,XXXV,"Into her den, and finds herself alone,"
16503,XXXV,"And, circling all the cavern, comprehends,"
16504,XXXV,"At last, that her beloved young are gone;"
16505,XXXV,"To ire, to rage like hers his wrath extends:"
16506,XXXV,"Nor night the king regards, nor rock, nor stone,"
16507,XXXV,Nor stream: -- Nor length of way nor storm arrest
16508,XXXV,The speed with which he on the plunderer prest.
16509,XXXV,
16510,XXXVI,XXXVI
16511,XXXVI,"So raging, to the pigmy dwarf who bore"
16512,XXXVI,"The news, exclaimed the king, ""Now hence away!"""
16513,XXXVI,"Nor horse he waits, nor carriage, nor, before"
16514,XXXVI,"Departing, deigns to his a word to say."
16515,XXXVI,"He hurries with such speed, that not with more"
16516,XXXVI,The lizard darts at noon across the way.
16517,XXXVI,"Horse had he none, but be he whose he might,"
16518,XXXVI,Would make his own the first which came in sight.
16519,XXXVI,
16520,XXXVII,XXXVII
16521,XXXVII,"Discord at this, who read his secret thought,"
16522,XXXVII,"Exclaimed, as she looked smilingly on Pride,"
16523,XXXVII,"Through her he to a courser should be brought,"
16524,XXXVII,By which new cause of strife should be supplied;
16525,XXXVII,"And, that by him no other might be caught,"
16526,XXXVII,She from his path would keep all steeds beside;
16527,XXXVII,And knew already where the prize to seek.
16528,XXXVII,"-- But her I leave, again of Charles to speak."

16530,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
16531,XXXVIII,"When, on the Saracen's departure, spent,"
16532,XXXVIII,"About King Charles, was the consuming flame,"
16533,XXXVIII,He ranged his troops anew: some warriors went
16534,XXXVIII,To strengthen feeble posts which succours claim;
16535,XXXVIII,"The rest against the Saracens are sent,"
16536,XXXVIII,To give the foe checkmate and end the game;
16537,XXXVIII,"And from St. German's to Saint Victor's gates,"
16538,XXXVIII,"He pours the host, which on his signal waits."
16539,XXXVIII,
16540,XXXIX,XXXIX
16541,XXXIX,"He these at Saint Marcellus' gate, where lay,"
16542,XXXIX,"Outstretched a large circumference of plain,"
16543,XXXIX,"Bade one another wait, in one array,"
16544,XXXIX,To reunite against the paynim train.
16545,XXXIX,"Inflaming every one to smite and slay,"
16546,XXXIX,"In guise, that for a record should remain,"
16547,XXXIX,He made the various troops fall in below
16548,XXXIX,"Their banners, and the battle-signal blow."

16554,XL,Is waging perilous and fearful fight.
16555,XL,Lurcanio with Sobrino strives as well;
16556,XL,"Rinaldo a troop encounters, whom the knight,"
16557,XL,"With Valour and with Fortune for his guide,"

16881,LXXIII,"Aquilant brooked not Gryphon such a feat,"

16884,LXXIII,But first besought the duke he would delay
16885,LXXIII,"To visit France and his paternal seat,"
16886,LXXIII,Till he from Antioch measured back his way.
16887,LXXIII,"At Joppa he embarks, who deems by sea"

16916,LXXVI,"Assured that Gryphon had pursued his quest,"

17181,CIII,To have such a comrade either cavalier
17182,CIII,"Is much rejoiced.  They to Damascus go,"
17183,CIII,"And in a suburb, of the city clear,"
17184,CIII,"Are lodged, upon the day before the show;"
17185,CIII,"And, till her aged lover, once so dear,"
17186,CIII,"Aurora roused, their humble roof below,"
17187,CIII,In greater ease the weary warriors rested
17188,CIII,Than had they been in costly palace guested.

17192,CIV,"Its shining glories all abroad had spread,"
17193,CIV,"The beauteous lady armed, and warriors twain,"
17194,CIV,"Having first couriers to the city sped,"
17195,CIV,"Who, when 'twas time, reported to the train,"
17196,CIV,"That, to see truncheons split in contest dread,"
17197,CIV,King Norandine had come into the square
17198,CIV,In which the cruel games appointed were.

17204,CV,"Ranged here and there, the knights of gentle race."
17205,CV,"The guerdons destined to the conqueror's hand,"

17211,CVI,"Norandine, sure that, in the martial game,"
17212,CVI,"Both prizes destined for the conquering knight,"
17213,CVI,"As well as one and the other tourney's fame,"
17214,CVI,"Must be obtained by Gryphon, named the white,"
17215,CVI,"To give him all that valiant man could claim,"
17216,CVI,"Nor could he give the warrior less, with right,"
17217,CVI,"The armour, guerdon of this final course"
17218,CVI,Placed with the tuck and mace and noble horse.
17219,CVI,
17220,CVII,CVII
17221,CVII,The arms which in the former joust the due

17224,CVII,"Martan' usurped, who Gryphon's bearing feigned)"
17225,CVII,To be hung up on high in public view
17226,CVII,"With the rich-flourished tuck, the king ordained,"
17227,CVII,And fastened at the saddle of the steed
17228,CVII,"The mace, that Gryphon might win either meed."
17229,CVII,
17230,CVIII,CVIII
17231,CVIII,But from effecting what he had intended
17232,CVIII,He was prevented by the warlike maid;
17233,CVIII,"Who late into the crowded square had wended,"
17234,CVIII,"With Sansonnet and England's duke arrayed,"
17235,CVIII,"Seeing the arms of which I spoke suspended,"
17236,CVIII,"She straight agnized the harness she surveyed,"
17237,CVIII,"Once hers, and dear to her; as matters are"
17238,CVIII,Esteemed by us as excellent and rare;

17242,CIX,"Had left the arms, when, to retrieve her sword,"
17243,CIX,"She from her shoulders slipt the ponderous load,"
17244,CIX,"And chased Brunello, worthy of the cord."
17245,CIX,"More to relate were labour ill bestowed,"
17246,CIX,"I deem, nor further of the tale record."

17255,CX,She thinks not if this mode or that be best
17256,CX,"To have them, anxious to regain her own;"
17257,CX,"But t'wards the arms with hand extended hies,"
17258,CX,And without more regard takes down the prize.

17261,CXI,"And throwing some on earth, it chanced that more"
17262,CXI,Than was her own she in her hurry took.
17263,CXI,"The Syrian king, who was offended sore,"
17264,CXI,Raised war against her with a single look.
17265,CXI,"For ill the wrong his angered people bore,"
17266,CXI,"And, to avenge him, lance and falchion shook;"
17267,CXI,"Remembering not, on other day, how dear"

17282,CXIII,"Imperious at the foolish rabble made,"
17283,CXIII,"And -- through the neck impaled or through the breast, --"
17284,CXIII,"Some pierced, some prostrate at the encounter layed."
17285,CXIII,Next this or that she with the falchion prest;
17286,CXIII,"The head from one she severed with the blade,"
17287,CXIII,"And from that other cleft: another sank,"

17294,CXIV,"Seeing the maid and crowd engaged in fight,"
17295,CXIV,"First lower the helmet's vizor, next the spear,"
17296,CXIV,And with their lances charge the mob outright:
17297,CXIV,"Then bare their falchions, and, amid the crew,"

17304,CXV,"And into mourning changed the expected sport,"
17305,CXV,Because all knew not what had moved the rage
17306,CXV,"Of the infuriate people in that sort,"
17307,CXV,"Nor what the insult offered to the king,"
17308,CXV,Suspended stood in doubt and wondering.
17309,CXV,
17310,CXVI,CXVI
17311,CXVI,"Of these, some will the crowded rabble's band"
17312,CXVI,(Too late repentant of the feat) befriend:
17313,CXVI,"Those, favouring not the natives of the land"
17314,CXVI,"More than the foreigners, to part them wend."
17315,CXVI,"Others more wary, with their reins in hand,"
17316,CXVI,Sit watching how the mischief is to end.
17317,CXVI,Gryphon and Aquilant are of the throng
17318,CXVI,Which hurry forward to avenge the wrong.

17323,CXVII,And having heard from many in the ring
17324,CXVII,"The occasion which the furious strife had wrought,"
17325,CXVII,Himself no whit less injured than the king
17326,CXVII,"Of Syria's land, offended Gryphon thought."
17327,CXVII,"Each knight, in haste, supplied himself with spear,"
17328,CXVII,And thundering vengeance drove in full career.
17329,CXVII,
17330,CXVIII,CXVIII
17331,CXVIII,"On Rabican, pricked forth before his hand,"
17332,CXVIII,"Valiant Astolpho, from the other bound,"
17333,CXVIII,"With the enchanted lance of gold in hand,"
17334,CXVIII,Which at the first encounter bore to ground
17335,CXVIII,What knights he smote with it; and on the sand
17336,CXVIII,"Laid Gryphon first; next Aquilant he found,"
17337,CXVIII,"And scarcely touched the border of his shield,"
17338,CXVIII,Ere he reversed the warrior on the field.

17340,CXIX,CXIX
17341,CXIX,"From lofty saddle Sansonnet o'erthrew,"
17342,CXIX,"Famous for price and prowess, many a knight."
17343,CXIX,To the outlet of the square the mob withdrew;
17344,CXIX,The monarch raged with anger and despite.
17345,CXIX,"Meanwhile, of the first cuirass and the new"
17346,CXIX,"Possest, as well as either helmet bright,"
17347,CXIX,"Marphisa, when she all in flight discerned,"
17348,CXIX,Conqueror towards her suburb-inn returned.

17350,CXX,CXX
17351,CXX,Sansonnet and Astolpho are not slow
17352,CXX,"In following t'wards the gate the martial maid,"

17354,CXX,And halt when they have reached the barricade.
17355,CXX,"Gryphon and Aquilant, who saw with woe"
17356,CXX,"Themselves on earth at one encounter laid,"
17357,CXX,"Their drooping heads, opprest with shame, decline,"
17358,CXX,Nor dare appear before King Norandine.

17360,CXXI,CXXI
17361,CXXI,"Seizing their steeds and mounting, either son"
17362,CXXI,Of Oliver to seek their foemen went:
17363,CXXI,With many of his vassals too is gone
17364,CXXI,The king; on death or vengeance all intent.
17365,CXXI,"The foolish rabble cry, ""Lay on, lay on."""
17366,CXXI,And stand at distance and await the event.
17367,CXXI,Gryphon arrived where the three friends had gained
17368,CXXI,"A bridge, and facing round the post maintained."
17369,CXXI,
17370,CXXII,CXXII
17371,CXXII,"He, at the first approach, Astolpho knew,"
17372,CXXII,"For still the same device had been his wear,"
17373,CXXII,"Even from the day he charmed Orrilo slew,"
17374,CXXII,"His horse, his arms the same: him not with care"
17375,CXXII,"Sir Gryphon had remarked, nor stedfast view,"
17376,CXXII,When late he jousted with him in the square:
17377,CXXII,He knows him here and greets; next prays him show
17378,CXXII,Who the companions are that with him go;
17379,CXXII,
17380,CXXIII,CXXIII
17381,CXXIII,"And why they had those arms, without the fear"
17382,CXXIII,"Of Syria's king, pulled down, and to his slight."
17383,CXXIII,"Of his champions England's cavalier,"
17384,CXXIII,Sir Gryphon courteously informed aright.
17385,CXXIII,"But little of those arms, pursued the peer,"
17386,CXXIII,"He knew, which were the occasion of the fight;"
17387,CXXIII,But (for he thither with Marphisa came
17388,CXXIII,And Sansonnet) had armed to aid the dame.
17389,CXXIII,
17390,CXXIV,CXXIV
17391,CXXIV,"While he and Gryphon stood in colloquy,"
17392,CXXIV,"Aquilant came, and knew Astolpho good,"
17393,CXXIV,"Whom he heard speaking with his brother nigh,"
17394,CXXIV,"And, though of evil purpose, changed his mood."
17395,CXXIV,"Of Norandine's trooped many, these to spy;"
17396,CXXIV,But came not nigh the warriors where they stood:
17397,CXXIV,"And seeing them in conference, stood clear,"
17398,CXXIV,"Listening, in silence, and intent to hear."
17399,CXXIV,
17400,CXXV,CXXV
17401,CXXV,"Some one who hears Marphisa hold is there,"
17402,CXXV,"Famed, through the world, for matchless bravery,"
17403,CXXV,"His courser turns, and bids the king have care,"
17404,CXXV,"Save he would lose his Syrian chivalry,"
17405,CXXV,"To snatch his court, before all slaughtered are,"
17406,CXXV,From the hand of Death and of Tisiphone:
17407,CXXV,"For that 'twas verily Marphisa, who"
17408,CXXV,Had borne away the arms in public view.
17409,CXXV,
17410,CXXVI,CXXVI
17411,CXXVI,"As Norandine is told that name of dread,"
17412,CXXVI,"Through the Levant so feared on every side,"
17413,CXXVI,Whose mention made the hair on many a head
17414,CXXVI,"Bristle, though she was often distant wide."
17415,CXXVI,"He fears the ill may happen which is said,"
17416,CXXVI,Unless against the mischief he provide;
17417,CXXVI,"And hence his meiny, who have changed their ire"
17418,CXXVI,"Already into fear, he bids retire."
17419,CXXVI,
17420,CXXVII,CXXVII
17421,CXXVII,"The sons of Oliver, on the other hand,"
17422,CXXVII,"With Sansonnetto and the English knight,"
17423,CXXVII,"So supplicate Marphisa, she her brand"
17424,CXXVII,"Puts up, and terminates the cruel fight;"
17425,CXXVII,"And to the monarch next, amid his brand,"
17426,CXXVII,"Cries, proudly, ""Sir, I know not by what right"
17427,CXXVII,"Thou wouldst this armour, not thine own, present"
17428,CXXVII,To him who conquers in thy tournament.

17441,CXXIX,"""To me this an Armenian merchant gave,"
17442,CXXIX,"'Tis true,"" replied the king, ""some days ago;"
17443,CXXIX,"And had you raised your voice, the arms to crave,"
17444,CXXIX,"You should have had them, whether yours or no."
17445,CXXIX,"For, notwithstanding I to Gryphon gave"
17446,CXXIX,"The armour, I so well his nature know,"
17447,CXXIX,"He freely would resign the gift he earned,"

17572,CXLII,Nor suffer sun or star to cheer the view.
17573,CXLII,"Above the welkin roared, beneath the main;"
17574,CXLII,On every side the wind and tempest grew;
17575,CXLII,"Which, with sharp piercing cold and blinding rain,"
17576,CXLII,Afflicted sore the miserable crew.
17577,CXLII,"While aye descending night, with deeper shade,"
17578,CXLII,The vext and fearful billows overlayed.

17580,CXLIII,CXLIII
17581,CXLIII,"The sailors, in this war of wind and flood,"
17582,CXLIII,Were prompt to manifest their vaunted art.
17583,CXLIII,"One blowing through the shrilling whistle stood,"
17584,CXLIII,And with the signal taught the rest their part.
17585,CXLIII,One clears the best bower anchor: one is good
17586,CXLIII,"To lower, this other to hawl home or start"
17587,CXLIII,"The braces; one from deck the lumber cast,"

17589,CXLIII,
17590,CXLIV,CXLIV
17591,CXLIV,"The cruel wind increased throughout the night,"
17592,CXLIV,Which grew more dismal and more dark than hell.
17593,CXLIV,"The wary Patron stood to sea outright,"
17594,CXLIV,Where he believed less broken was the swell;
17595,CXLIV,"And turned his prow to meet, with ready sleight,"
17596,CXLIV,The buffets of the dreadful waves which fell;
17597,CXLIV,"Never without some hope, that at day-break"

17604,CXLV,And not by any cheering light or ray.
17605,CXLV,"Now, with more fear (his weaker hope o'erthrown)."
17606,CXLV,"The sorrowing Patron to the wind gives way,"
17607,CXLV,"He veers his barque before the cruel gale,"
17608,CXLV,And scowers the foaming sea with humble sail.

17611,CXLVI,"While Fortune on the sea annoys this crew,"

17614,CXLVI,The men of England and the paynim band.
17615,CXLVI,These bold Rinaldo broke and overthrew;
17616,CXLVI,Nor troops nor banners spread before him stand:
17617,CXLVI,"I speak of him, who his Baiardo fleet"

17657,CL,"So said, and grasping in his hand the sword,"

17673,CLII,"He spurs, and lets with that the bridle go,"
17674,CLII,"And a thrust pushes with such might and main,"
17675,CLII,"-- A thrust against the bosom of his foe,"
17676,CLII,That at his back the blade appears again.
17677,CLII,"Forth issued blood and soul, and from his sell"
17678,CLII,Lifeless and cold the reeling body fell.
17679,CLII,
17680,CLIII,CLIII

17682,CLIII,Which levelled by the passing ploughshare lies;

17725,CLVII,"He sends to pray the king of Barbary,"
17726,CLVII,"To endeavour to retire, as best be can;"

17765,CLXI,Charlemagne wisely by the lock before

17785,CLXIII,"The paynim fashions ditch and bastion,"
17786,CLXIII,"Rampart and mine, and all things requisite;"
17787,CLXIII,"Visits his outposts and his guards alarms,"

17795,CLXIV,One grief for slaughtered friends or kindred vents;
17796,CLXIV,"Some are by sorrows of their own distrest,"
17797,CLXIV,As wounded or as ill at ease; but more

17800,CLXV,CLXV
17801,CLXV,"Two Moors amid the paynim army were,"
17802,CLXV,From stock obscure in Ptolomita grown;
17803,CLXV,"Of whom the story, an example rare"
17804,CLXV,"Of constant love, is worthy to be known:"
17805,CLXV,Medoro and Cloridan were named the pair;
17806,CLXV,"Who, whether Fortune pleased to smile or frown,"
17807,CLXV,"Served Dardinello with fidelity,"
17808,CLXV,And late with him to France had crost the sea.
17809,CLXV,
17810,CLXVI,CLXVI
17811,CLXVI,"Of nimble frame and strong was Cloridane,"
17812,CLXVI,Throughout his life a follower of the chase.
17813,CLXVI,"A cheek of white, suffused with crimson grain,"
17814,CLXVI,"Medoro had, in youth a pleasing grace."
17815,CLXVI,"Nor bound on that emprize, 'mid all the train,"
17816,CLXVI,Was there a fairer or more jocund face.
17817,CLXVI,"Crisp hair he had of gold, and jet-black eyes:"
17818,CLXVI,And seemed an angel lighted from the skies.
17819,CLXVI,
17820,CLXVII,CLXVII
17821,CLXVII,"These two were posted on a rampart's height,"
17822,CLXVII,"With more to guard the encampment from surprise,"
17823,CLXVII,"When 'mid the equal intervals, at night,"
17824,CLXVII,Medoro gazed on heaven with sleepy eyes.
17825,CLXVII,"In all his talk, the stripling, woful wight,"
17826,CLXVII,"Here cannot choose, but of his lord devise,"
17827,CLXVII,The royal Dardinel; and evermore
17828,CLXVII,"Him, left unhonoured on the field, deplore."
17829,CLXVII,
17830,CLXVIII,CLXVIII
17831,CLXVIII,"Then, turning to his mate, cries: ""Cloridane,"
17832,CLXVIII,I cannot tell thee what a cause of woe
17833,CLXVIII,"It is to me, my lord upon the plain"
17834,CLXVIII,"Should lie, unworthy food for wolf or crow!"
17835,CLXVIII,"Thinking how still to me he was humane,"
17836,CLXVIII,"Meseems, if in his honour I forego"
17837,CLXVIII,"This life of mine, for favours so immense"
17838,CLXVIII,I shall but make a feeble recompense.
17839,CLXVIII,
17840,CLXIX,CLXIX
17841,CLXIX,"""That he may lack not sepulture, will I"
17842,CLXIX,"Go forth, and seek him out among the slain;"
17843,CLXIX,And haply God may will that none shall spy
17844,CLXIX,Where Charles's camp lies hushed.  Do thou remain;
17845,CLXIX,"That, if my death be written in the sky,"
17846,CLXIX,Thou may'st the deed be able to explain.
17847,CLXIX,"So that if Fortune foil so fear a feat,"
17848,CLXIX,"The world, through Fame, my loving heart may weet."""
17849,CLXIX,
17850,CLXX,CLXX
17851,CLXX,Amazed was Cloridan a child should show
17852,CLXX,"Such heart, such love, and such fair loyalty;"
17853,CLXX,"And fain would make the youth his though forego,"
17854,CLXX,Whom he held passing dear; but fruitlessly
17855,CLXX,Would move his stedfast purpose; for such woe
17856,CLXX,Will neither comforted nor altered be.
17857,CLXX,"Medoro is disposed to meet his doom,"
17858,CLXX,Or to enclose his master in the tomb.

17860,CLXXI,CLXXI
17861,CLXXI,"Seeing that nought would bend him, nought would move,"
17862,CLXXI,"""I too will go,"" was Cloridan's reply,"
17863,CLXXI,"""In such a glorious act myself will prove;"
17864,CLXXI,"As well such famous death I cover, I:"
17865,CLXXI,"What other thing is left me, here above,"
17866,CLXXI,"Deprived of thee, Medoro mine?  To die"
17867,CLXXI,"With thee in arms is better, on the plain,"
17868,CLXXI,"Than afterwards of grief, should'st thou be slain."""
17869,CLXXI,
17870,CLXXII,CLXXII
17871,CLXXII,"And thus resolved, disposing in their place"
17872,CLXXII,"Their guard's relief, depart the youthful pair,"
17873,CLXXII,"Leave fosse and palisade, and, in small space,"
17874,CLXXII,"Are among ours, who watch with little care:"
17875,CLXXII,"Who, for they little fear the paynim race,"
17876,CLXXII,Slumber with fires extinguished everywhere.
17877,CLXXII,"'Mid carriages and arms, they lie supine"
17878,CLXXII,"Up to the eyes, immersed in sleep and wine."
17879,CLXXII,
17880,CLXXIII,CLXXIII
17881,CLXXIII,A moment Cloridano stopt and cried:
17882,CLXXIII,"""Not to be lost are opportunities."
17883,CLXXIII,"This troop, by whom my master's blood was shed,"
17884,CLXXIII,"Medoro, ought not I to sacrifice?"
17885,CLXXIII,"Do thou, lest any one this way be led,"
17886,CLXXIII,"Watch everywhere about, with ears and eyes."
17887,CLXXIII,"For a wide way, amid the hostile horde,"
17888,CLXXIII,"I offer here to make thee with my sword."""
17889,CLXXIII,
17890,CLXXIV,CLXXIV
17891,CLXXIV,"So said he, and his talk cut quickly short,"
17892,CLXXIV,Coming where learned Alpheus slumbered nigh;
17893,CLXXIV,"Who had the year before sought Charles's court,"
17894,CLXXIV,"In medicine, magic, and astrology"
17895,CLXXIV,"Well versed; but now in art found small-support,"
17896,CLXXIV,Or rather found that it was all a lie.
17897,CLXXIV,"He had foreseen, that he his long-drawn life"
17898,CLXXIV,Should finish in the bosom of his wife.
17899,CLXXIV,
17900,CLXXV,CLXXV
17901,CLXXV,And now the Saracen with wary view
17902,CLXXV,Has pierced his weasand with the pointed sword.
17903,CLXXV,"Four others he neat that Diviner, slew,"
17904,CLXXV,Nor gave the wretches time to say a word.
17905,CLXXV,"Sir Turpin in his story tells not who,"
17906,CLXXV,And Time had of their names effaced record.
17907,CLXXV,Palidon of Moncalier next he speeds;

17912,CLXXVI,"Pillowed on barrel, lay the wretched Gryll:"
17913,CLXXVI,"This he had drained, and undisturbed by dread,"
17914,CLXXVI,Hoped to enjoy a peaceful sleep and still.
17915,CLXXVI,"The daring Saracen lopt off his head,"
17916,CLXXVI,"Blood issues from the tap-hole, with a rill"
17917,CLXXVI,"Of wine; and he, well drenched with many a can,"
17918,CLXXVI,"Dreams that he drinks, dispatched by Cloridan."

17921,CLXXVII,"Next Gryll, Andropono and Conrad hight,"
17922,CLXXVII,"A Greek and German, at two thrusts he gored,"

17924,CLXXVII,With dice and goblet; blest it at that board
17925,CLXXVII,"They still had watched, till, clothed in amber light,"
17926,CLXXVII,The radiant sun had traversed Indus' ford!
17927,CLXXVII,But mortals Destiny would set at nought

17971,CLXXXII,"And though they might escape well charged with prey,"
17972,CLXXXII,To save themselves they think sufficient gain.
17973,CLXXXII,Thither by what he deems the safest way
17974,CLXXXII,(Medoro following him) went Cloridane
17975,CLXXXII,"Where, in the field, 'mid bow and falchion, lay,"
17976,CLXXXII,"And shield and spear, in pool of purple stain,"
17977,CLXXXII,"Wealthy and poor, the king and vassal's corse,"
17978,CLXXXII,And overthrown the rider and his horse.

17981,CLXXXIII,The horrid mixture of the bodies there

17986,CLXXXIII,Out of a gloomy cloud put forth her horn.
17987,CLXXXIII,Medoro to the heavens upturns his eyes
17988,CLXXXIII,"Towards the moon, and thus devoutly cries:"

17990,CLXXXIV,CLXXXIV
17991,CLXXXIV,"""O holy goddess!  whom our fathers well"

18001,CLXXXV,At the youth's prayer from parted cloud outshone
18002,CLXXXV,(Were it the work of faith or accident)
18003,CLXXXV,"The moon, as fair, as when Endymion"
18004,CLXXXV,"She circled in her naked arms: with tent,"
18005,CLXXXV,"Christian or Saracen, was Paris-town"
18006,CLXXXV,"Seen in that gleam, and hill and plain's extent."

18014,CLXXXVI,"Who well agnized the quartering white and red,"
18015,CLXXXVI,With visage bathed in many a bitter tear
18016,CLXXXVI,"(For he a rill from either eyelid shed),"
18017,CLXXXVI,"And piteous act and moan, that might have whist"
18018,CLXXXVI,"The winds, his melancholy plaint to list;"
18019,CLXXXVI,
18020,CLXXXVII,CLXXXVII
18021,CLXXXVII,But with a voice supprest: not that he aught
18022,CLXXXVII,"Regards if any one the noise should hear,"
18023,CLXXXVII,Because he of his life takes any thought;
18024,CLXXXVII,Of which loathed burden he would fain be clear;
18025,CLXXXVII,"But, lest his being heard should bring to nought"
18026,CLXXXVII,The pious purpose which has brought them here.

18030,CLXXXVIII,CLXXXVIII
18031,CLXXXVIII,"Hurrying their steps, they hastened, as they might,"

18034,CLXXXVIII,"To sweep from heaven the stars, from earth the shade."

18036,CLXXXVIII,"Was ne'er in time of need by sleep down-weighed,"
18037,CLXXXVIII,"From chasing Moors all night, his homeward way"
18038,CLXXXVIII,Was taking to the camp at dawn of day.

18041,CLXXXIX,"He has with him some horsemen in his train,"
18042,CLXXXIX,That from afar the two companions spy.

18044,CLXXXIX,"They, every one, towards that quarter hie."
18045,CLXXXIX,"""Brother, behoves us,"" cried young Cloridane,"
18046,CLXXXIX,"""To cast away the load we bear, and fly:"

18054,CXC,"His shoulders to the weight, alone, applied;"
18055,CXC,"Cloridan hurrying with all haste before,"
18056,CXC,Deeming him close behind him or beside;

18064,CXCI,And every pass and outlet occupy.
18065,CXCI,"The captain, little distant from his crew,"
18066,CXCI,Is keener than the rest the chase to ply;
18067,CXCI,"And, when he sees them hurrying in such guise,"

18371,XXVIII,"-- Heeds not herself, and only to content"
18372,XXVIII,The author of her cruel ill is bent.
18373,XXVIII,
18374,XXIX,XXIX
18375,XXIX,Her ill but festered and increased the more
18376,XXIX,The stripling's wounds were seen to heal and close:
18377,XXIX,"The youth grew lusty, while she suffered sore,"
18378,XXIX,"And, with new fever parched, now burnt, now froze:"
18379,XXIX,From day to day in beauty waxed Medore:
18380,XXIX,She miserably wasted; like the snow's
18381,XXIX,"Unseasonable flake, which melts away"
18382,XXIX,"Exposed, in sunny place, to scorching ray."
18383,XXIX,
18384,XXX,XXX
18385,XXX,"She, if of vain desire will not die,"

18387,XXX,"And she in truth, her will to satisfy,"
18388,XXX,Deemed 'twas no time to wait till she was prayed.
18389,XXX,"And next of shame renouncing every tye,"
18390,XXX,"With tongue as bold as eyes, petition made,"
18391,XXX,"And begged him, haply an unwitting foe,"

18395,XXXI,"O Count Orlando, O king of Circassy,"

18399,XXXI,"Sirs, show me but a single courtesy,"
18400,XXXI,"With which she ever graced ye, -- old or new, --"
18401,XXXI,"As some poor recompense, desert, or guerdon,"

18405,XXXII,"Oh! couldst thou yet again to life return,"
18406,XXXII,"How hard would this appear, O Agricane!"
18407,XXXII,"In that she whilom thee was wont to spurn,"
18408,XXXII,With sharp repulse and insolent disdain.
18409,XXXII,"O Ferrau, O ye thousand more, forlorn,"
18410,XXXII,"Unsung, who wrought a thousand feats in vain"
18411,XXXII,"For this ungrateful fair, what pain 'twould be"

18419,XXXIII,"They holy ceremonies interpose,"
18420,XXXIII,Somedeal to veil -- to gild -- the matter o'er.
18421,XXXIII,"Young Love was bridesman there the tie to bless,"

18424,XXXIV,XXXIV
18425,XXXIV,"In the low shed, with all solemnities,"
18426,XXXIV,The couple made their wedding as they might;
18427,XXXIV,"And there above a month, in tranquil guise,"
18428,XXXIV,The happy lovers rested in delight.
18429,XXXIV,"Save for the youth the lady has no eyes,"
18430,XXXIV,Nor with his looks can satisfy her sight.
18431,XXXIV,"Nor yet of hanging on his neck can tire,"

18446,XXXVI,"Ran stream, or bubbling fountain's wave did spin,"
18447,XXXVI,"On bark or rock, if yielding were the stone,"
18448,XXXVI,The knife was straight at work or ready pin.
18449,XXXVI,"And there, without, in thousand places lone,"
18450,XXXVI,"And in as many places graved, within,"
18451,XXXVI,"MEDORO and ANGELICA were traced,"

18456,XXXVII,"More than enow, the damsel made design"
18457,XXXVII,"In India to revisit her Catay,"
18458,XXXVII,And with its crown Medoro's head entwine.
18459,XXXVII,"She had upon her wrist an armlet, gay"
18460,XXXVII,"With costly gems, in witness and in sign"
18461,XXXVII,"Of love to her by Count Orlando borne,"

18475,XXXIX,"No love which to the paladin she bears,"
18476,XXXIX,"But that it costly is and wrought with care,"
18477,XXXIX,"This to Angelica so much endears,"
18478,XXXIX,That never more esteemed was matter rare:

18480,XXXIX,"I know not by what privilege, to wear,"

18690,LX,Than a hundred thousand swords dismayed them more.

18776,LXIX,The beldam found them bold; for to compete
18777,LXIX,"With those they should engage, and play their part"
18778,LXIX,The champions hoped alike in either feat.
18779,LXIX,"Nor failed renowned Marphisa's valiant heart,"
18780,LXIX,Albeit for the second dance unmeet;
18781,LXIX,"Secure, where nature had her aid denied,"
18782,LXIX,The want should with the falchion be supplied.
18783,LXIX,
18784,LXX,LXX
18785,LXX,The patron is commanded their reply
18786,LXX,Resolved in common council to unfold;
18787,LXX,"The dames at pleasure may their prowess try,"
18788,LXX,And shall in lists and bed allow them bold.
18789,LXX,"The lashings from the vessels they untie,"
18790,LXX,"The skipper heaves the warp, and bids lay hold,"
18791,LXX,"And lowers the bridge; o'er which, in warlike weed,"
18792,LXX,The expectant cavaliers their coursers lead.
18793,LXX,
18794,LXXI,LXXI
18795,LXXI,"These through the middle of the city go,"
18796,LXXI,"And see the damsels, as they forward fare,"
18797,LXXI,"Ride through the streets, succinct, in haughty show,"
18798,LXXI,"And arm, in guise of warriors, in the square."
18799,LXXI,"Nor to gird sword, nor fasten spur below,"
18800,LXXI,"Is man allowed, nor any arm to wear;"
18801,LXXI,"Excepting, as I said, the ten; to follow"
18802,LXXI,The ancient usage which those women hallow.
18803,LXXI,
18804,LXXII,LXXII
18805,LXXII,"All others of the manly sex they seat,"
18806,LXXII,"To ply the distaff, broider, card and sow,"
18807,LXXII,"In female gown descending to the feet,"
18808,LXXII,Which renders them effeminate and slow;
18809,LXXII,"Some chained, another labour to complete,"
18810,LXXII,"Are tasked, to keep their cattle, or to plough."
18811,LXXII,"Few are the males; and scarce the warriors ken,"
18812,LXXII,"Amid a thousand dames, a hundred men."
18813,LXXII,
18814,LXXIII,LXXIII
18815,LXXIII,The knights determining by lot to try
18816,LXXIII,"Who in their common cause on listed ground,"
18817,LXXIII,"Should slay the ten, with whom they were to vie,"
18818,LXXIII,"And in the other field ten others wound,"
18819,LXXIII,"Designed to pass the bold Marphisa by,"
18820,LXXIII,Believing she unfitting would be found;
18821,LXXIII,"And would be, in the second joust at eve,"
18822,LXXIII,Ill-qualified the victory to achieve.
18823,LXXIII,
18824,LXXIV,LXXIV
18825,LXXIV,"But with the others she, the martial maid,"
18826,LXXIV,Will run her risque; and 'tis her destiny.
18827,LXXIV,"""I will lay down this life,"" the damsel said,"
18828,LXXIV,"""Rather than you lay down your liberty."
18829,LXXIV,"But this"" -- with that she pointed to the blade"
18830,LXXIV,"Which she had girt -- ""is your security,"
18831,LXXIV,"I will all tangles in such manner loose,"
18832,LXXIV,As Alexander did the Gordian noose.
18833,LXXIV,
18834,LXXV,LXXV
18835,LXXV,"""I will not henceforth stranger shall complain,"
18836,LXXV,"So long as the world lasts, of this repair."""
18837,LXXV,"So said the maid, nor could the friendly train"
18838,LXXV,Take from her what had fallen to her share.
18839,LXXV,"Then, -- either every thing to lose, or gain"
18840,LXXV,"Their liberty, -- to her they leave the care."
18841,LXXV,"With stubborn plate and mail all over steeled,"
18842,LXXV,"Ready for cruel fight, she takes the field."
18843,LXXV,
18844,LXXVI,LXXVI
18845,LXXVI,"High up the spacious city is place,"
18846,LXXVI,"With steps, which serve as seats in rising rows;"
18847,LXXVI,"Which for nought else is used, except the chase,"
18848,LXXVI,"Tourney, or wrestling match, or such-like shows."
18849,LXXVI,Four gates of solid bronze the rabble flows
18850,LXXVI,"In troubled tide; and to Marphisa bold,"
18851,LXXVI,"That she may enter, afterwards is told."
18852,LXXVI,
18853,LXXVII,LXXVII
18854,LXXVII,"On pieballed horse Marphisa entered, -- spread"
18855,LXXVII,"Were circles dappling all about his hair, --"
18856,LXXVII,"Of a bold countenance and little head,"
18857,LXXVII,"And beauteous points, and haughty gait and air."
18858,LXXVII,"Out of a thousand coursers which he fed,"
18859,LXXVII,"Him, as the best, and biggest, and most rare,"
18860,LXXVII,"King Norandino chose, and, decked with brave"
18861,LXXVII,"And costly trappings, to Marphisa gave."
18862,LXXVII,
18863,LXXVIII,LXXVIII
18864,LXXVIII,"Through the south gate, from the mid-day, the plain"
18865,LXXVIII,"Marphisa entered, nor expected long,"
18866,LXXVIII,Before she heard approaching trumpet-strain
18867,LXXVIII,Peal through the lists in shrilling notes and strong;
18868,LXXVIII,"And, looking next towards the northern wain,"
18869,LXXVIII,Saw her ten opposites appear: among
18870,LXXVIII,"These, as their leader, pricked a cavalier,"
18871,LXXVIII,Excelling all the rest in goodly cheer.
18872,LXXVIII,
18873,LXXIX,LXXIX
18874,LXXIX,"On a large courser came the leading foe,"
18875,LXXIX,"Which was, excepting the near foot behind"
18876,LXXIX,"And forehead, darker than was ever crow:"
18877,LXXIX,His foot and forehead with some white were signed.
18878,LXXIX,The horseman did his horse's colours show
18879,LXXIX,"In his own dress; and hence might be divined,"
18880,LXXIX,"He, as the mournful hue o'erpowered the clear,"
18881,LXXIX,"Was less inclined to smile, than mournful tear."
18882,LXXIX,
18883,LXXX,LXXX
18884,LXXX,"At once their spears in rest nine warriors laid,"
18885,LXXX,"When the trump sounded, in the hostile train,"
18886,LXXX,"But he in black no sign of jousting made,"
18887,LXXX,As if he held such vantage in disdain:
18888,LXXX,"Better he deemed the law were disobeyed,"
18889,LXXX,Than that his courtesy should suffer stain.
18890,LXXX,"The knight retires apart, and sits to view"
18891,LXXX,What against nine one single lance can do.
18892,LXXX,
18893,LXXXI,LXXXI
18894,LXXXI,"Of smooth and balanced pace, the damsel's horse"
18895,LXXXI,To the encounter her with swiftness bore;
18896,LXXXI,"Who poised a lance so massive in the course,"
18897,LXXXI,It would have been an overweight for four.
18898,LXXXI,"She, disembarking, as of greatest force,"
18899,LXXXI,The boom had chosen out of many more.
18900,LXXXI,"At her fierce semblance when in motion, quail"
18901,LXXXI,"A thousand hearts, a thousand looks grow pale."
18902,LXXXI,
18903,LXXXII,LXXXII
18904,LXXXII,"The bosom of the first she opens so,"
18905,LXXXII,"As might surprise, if naked were the breast:"
18906,LXXXII,She pierced the cuirass and the mail below;
18907,LXXXII,"But first a buckler, solid and well prest,"
18908,LXXXII,A yard behind the shoulders of the foe
18909,LXXXII,"Was seen the steel, so well was it addrest."
18910,LXXXII,"Speared on her lance she left him on the plain,"
18911,LXXXII,And at the others drove with flowing rein;
18912,LXXXII,
18913,LXXXIII,LXXXIII
18914,LXXXIII,"And so she shocked the second of the crew,"
18915,LXXXIII,"And dealt the third so terrible a blow,"
18916,LXXXIII,"From sell and life, with broken spine, the two"
18917,LXXXIII,"She drove at once.  So fell the overthrow,"
18918,LXXXIII,And with such weight she charged the warriors through!
18919,LXXXIII,So serried was the battle of the foe! --
18920,LXXXIII,I have seen bombard open in such mode
18921,LXXXIII,"The squadrons, as that band Marphisa strowed."
18922,LXXXIII,
18923,LXXXIV,LXXXIV
18924,LXXXIV,"Many good spears were broken on the dame,"
18925,LXXXIV,"Who was as little moved as solid wall,"
18926,LXXXIV,"When revellers play the chace's merry game,"
18927,LXXXIV,Is ever moved by stroke of heavy ball.
18928,LXXXIV,"So hard the temper of her corslet's mail,"
18929,LXXXIV,"The strokes aye harmless on the breast-plate fall,"
18930,LXXXIV,"Whose steel was heated in the fires of hell,"
18931,LXXXIV,And in Avernus' water slaked by spell.
18932,LXXXIV,
18933,LXXXV,LXXXV
18934,LXXXV,"At the end of the career, she checked her steed,"
18935,LXXXV,"Wheeled him about, and for a little stayed;"
18936,LXXXV,"And then against the others drove at speed,"
18937,LXXXV,"Broke them, and to the handle dyed her blade."
18938,LXXXV,"Here shorn of arms, and there of head, they bleed;"
18939,LXXXV,"And other in such manner cleft the maid,"
18940,LXXXV,"That breast, and head, and arms together fell,"
18941,LXXXV,Belly and legs remaining in the sell.
18942,LXXXV,
18943,LXXXVI,LXXXVI
18944,LXXXVI,"With such just measure him she cleaves, I say,"
18945,LXXXVI,Where the two haunches and the ribs confine:
18946,LXXXVI,"And leaves him a half figure, in such way"
18947,LXXXVI,"As what we before images divine,"
18948,LXXXVI,"Of silver, oftener made of wax, survey;"
18949,LXXXVI,"Which supplicants from far and near enshrine,"
18950,LXXXVI,"In thanks for mercy shown, and to bestow"
18951,LXXXVI,A pious quittance for accepted vow.
18952,LXXXVI,
18953,LXXXVII,LXXXVII
18954,LXXXVII,"Marphisa next made after one that flew,"
18955,LXXXVII,"And overtook the wretch, and cleft (before"
18956,LXXXVII,"He the mid square had won) his collar through,"
18957,LXXXVII,"So clean, no surgeon ever pieced it more."
18958,LXXXVII,"One after other, all in fine she slew,"
18959,LXXXVII,"Or wounded every one she smote so sore,"
18960,LXXXVII,"She was secure, that never more would foe"
18961,LXXXVII,"Arise anew from earth, to work her woe."
18962,LXXXVII,
18963,LXXXVIII,LXXXVIII
18964,LXXXVIII,"The cavalier this while had stood aside,"
18965,LXXXVIII,"Who had the ten conducted to the place,"
18966,LXXXVIII,"Since, with so many against one to ride,"
18967,LXXXVIII,Had seemed to him advantage four and base;
18968,LXXXVIII,"Who, now he by a single hand espied"
18969,LXXXVIII,"So speedily his whole array displaced,"
18970,LXXXVIII,"Pricked forth against the martial maid, to show"
18971,LXXXVIII,"'Twas courtesy, not fear, had made him slow."
18972,LXXXVIII,
18973,LXXXIX,LXXXIX
18974,LXXXIX,"He, signing with his right hand, made appear"
18975,LXXXIX,"That he would speak ere their career was run,"
18976,LXXXIX,Nor thinking that beneath such manly cheer
18977,LXXXIX,"A gentle virgin was concealed, begun:"
18978,LXXXIX,"""I wot thou needs must be, sir cavalier,"
18979,LXXXIX,Sore wearied with such mighty slaughter done;
18980,LXXXIX,And if I were disposed to weary thee
18981,LXXXIX,"More than thou art, it were discourtesy."
18982,LXXXIX,
18983,XC,XC
18984,XC,"""To thee, to rest until to-morrow's light,"
18985,XC,"Then to renew the battle, I concede."
18986,XC,No honour 'twere to-day to prove my might
18987,XC,"On thee, whom weak and overwrought I read."""
18988,XC,"-- ""Arms are not new to me, nor listed fight;"
18989,XC,"Nor does fatigue so short a toil succeed,"""
18990,XC,"Answered Marphisa, ""and I, at my post,"
18991,XC,"Hope to prove this upon thee, to thy cost."

18994,XCI,"""I thank thee for thy offer of delay,"
18995,XCI,But need not what thy courtesy agrees;

18997,XCI,"'Twere very shame to spend it all in ease."""
18998,XCI,"-- ""Oh!  were I (he replied) so sure to appay"
18999,XCI,"My heart with everything which best would please,"
19000,XCI,"As thine I shall appay in this! -- but see,"
19001,XCI,"That ere thou thinkest, daylight fail not thee."""
19002,XCI,
19003,XCII,XCII
19004,XCII,"So said he, and obedient to his hest"
19005,XCII,"Two spears, say rather heavy booms, they bear."
19006,XCII,"He to Marphisa bids consigns the best,"
19007,XCII,And the other takes himself: the martial pair
19008,XCII,"Already, with their lances in the rest,"
19009,XCII,Wait but till other blast the joust declare.
19010,XCII,"Lo!  earth and air and sea the noise rebound,"
19011,XCII,"As they prick forth, at the first trumpet's sound!"
19012,XCII,
19013,XCIII,XCIII
19014,XCIII,"No mouth was opened and no eyelid fell,"
19015,XCIII,"Nor breath was drawn, amid the observant crew:"
19016,XCIII,So sore intent was every one to spell
19017,XCIII,Which should be conqueror of the warlike two.
19018,XCIII,"Marphisa the black champion from his sell,"
19019,XCIII,"So to o'erthrow he shall not rise anew,"
19020,XCIII,"Levels her lance; and the black champion, bent"
19021,XCIII,"To slay Marphisa, spurs with like intent."
19022,XCIII,
19023,XCIV,XCIV
19024,XCIV,"Both lances, made of willow thin and dry,"
19025,XCIV,"Rather than stout and stubborn oak, appeared;"
19026,XCIV,"So splintered even to the rest, they fly:"
19027,XCIV,"While with such force the encountering steeds careered,"
19028,XCIV,"It seemed, as with a scythe-blade equally"
19029,XCIV,The hams of either courser had been sheared.
19030,XCIV,"Alike both fall; but voiding quick the seat,"
19031,XCIV,The nimble riders start upon their feet.

19033,XCV,XCV
19034,XCV,"Marphisa in her life, with certain wound,"
19035,XCV,A thousand cavaliers on earth had laid;
19036,XCV,And never had herself been borne to ground;
19037,XCV,"Yet quitted now the saddle, as was said."
19038,XCV,"Not only at the accident astound,"
19039,XCV,"But nigh beside herself, remained the maid."
19040,XCV,"Strange to the sable cavalier withal,"
19041,XCV,"Unwont to be unhorsed, appeared his fall."

19043,XCVI,XCVI
19044,XCVI,They scarcely touch the ground before they gain
19045,XCVI,"Their feet, and now the fierce assault renew,"
19046,XCVI,With cut and thrust; which now with shield the twain
19047,XCVI,"Or blade ward off, and now by leaps eschew."
19048,XCVI,"Whether the foes strike home, or smite in vain,"
19049,XCVI,"Blows ring, and echo parted aether through."
19050,XCVI,"More force those shields, those helms, those breast-plates show"
19051,XCVI,Than anvils underneath the sounding blow.
19052,XCVI,
19053,XCVII,XCVII
19054,XCVII,"If heavy falls the savage damsel's blade,"
19055,XCVII,That falls not lightly of her warlike foe.
19056,XCVII,Equal the measure one the other paid;
19057,XCVII,And both receive as much as they bestow.
19058,XCVII,"He who would see two daring spirits weighed,"
19059,XCVII,To seek two fiercer need no further go.
19060,XCVII,Nor to seek more dexterity or might;
19061,XCVII,For greater could not be in mortal wight.
19062,XCVII,
19063,XCVIII,XCVIII
19064,XCVIII,"The women who have sate long time, to view"

19994,LXXXI,"Oft marking, still with harness on their backs,"
19995,LXXXI,If ruddy yet with light the orient wax.
19996,LXXXI,
19997,LXXXII,LXXXII
19998,LXXXII,Not yet from earth's hard visage has the sun
19999,LXXXII,Lifted her veil of dim and dingy dye;
20000,LXXXII,"Scarcely Lycaon's child, her furrow done,"
20001,LXXXII,Has turned about her ploughshare in the sky;
20002,LXXXII,When to the theatre the women run
20003,LXXXII,"Who would the fearful battle's end espy,"
20004,LXXXII,"As swarming bees upon their threshold cluster,"
20005,LXXXII,Who bent on change of realm in springtide muster.
20006,LXXXII,
20007,LXXXIII,LXXXIII
20008,LXXXIII,"With warlike trumpet, drum, and sound of horn,"
20009,LXXXIII,The people make the land and welkin roar;
20010,LXXXIII,"Summoning thus their chieftain to return,"
20011,LXXXIII,And end of unfinished warfare.  Covered o'er
20012,LXXXIII,"With arms stand Aquilant and Gryphon stern,"
20013,LXXXIII,And the redoubted duke from England's shore.
20014,LXXXIII,"Marphisa, Dudo, Sansonet, and all"
20015,LXXXIII,The knights or footmen harboured in that hall.
20016,LXXXIII,
20017,LXXXIV,LXXXIV
20018,LXXXIV,Hence to descend towards the sea or port
20019,LXXXIV,The way across the place of combat lies;
20020,LXXXIV,"Nor was there other passage, long or short."
20021,LXXXIV,Sir Guido so to his companions cries:
20022,LXXXIV,"And having ceased his comrades to exhort,"
20023,LXXXIV,"To do their best set forth in silent wise,"
20024,LXXXIV,"And in the place appeared, amid the throng,"
20025,LXXXIV,Head of a squad above a hundred strong.
20026,LXXXIV,
20027,LXXXV,LXXXV
20028,LXXXV,"Toward the other gate Sir Guido went,"
20029,LXXXV,"Hurrying his band, but, gathered far and nigh"
20030,LXXXV,"The mighty multitude, for aye intent"
20031,LXXXV,"To smite, and clad in arms, when they descry"
20032,LXXXV,"The comrades whom he leads, perceive his bent,"
20033,LXXXV,And truly deem he is about to fly.
20034,LXXXV,"All in a thought betake them to their bows,"
20035,LXXXV,And at the portal part the knight oppose.
20036,LXXXV,
20037,LXXXVI,LXXXVI
20038,LXXXVI,Sir Guido and the cavaliers who go
20039,LXXXVI,"Beneath that champion's guidance, and before"
20040,LXXXVI,"The others bold Marphisa, were not slow"
20041,LXXXVI,"To strike, and laboured hard to force the door."
20042,LXXXVI,"But such a storm of darts from ready bow,"
20043,LXXXVI,"Dealing on all sides death or wounding sore,"
20044,LXXXVI,"Was rained in fury on the troop forlorn,"
20045,LXXXVI,They feared at last to encounter skaith and scorn.
20046,LXXXVI,
20047,LXXXVII,LXXXVII
20048,LXXXVII,"Of proof the corslet was each warrior wore,"
20049,LXXXVII,Who without this would have had worse to fear:
20050,LXXXVII,"Sansonnet's horse was slain, and that which bore"
20051,LXXXVII,Marphisa: to himself the English peer
20052,LXXXVII,"Exclaimed, ""Why wait I longer?  As if more"
20053,LXXXVII,My horn could ever succour me than here.
20054,LXXXVII,"Since the sword steads not, I will make assay"
20055,LXXXVII,"If with my bugle I can clear the way."""
20056,LXXXVII,
20057,LXXXVIII,LXXXVIII
20058,LXXXVIII,"As he was customed in extremity,"
20059,LXXXVIII,He to his mouth applied the bugle's round;
20060,LXXXVIII,"The wide world seemed to tremble, earth and sky,"
20061,LXXXVIII,As he in air discharged the horrid sound.
20062,LXXXVIII,"Such terror smote the dames, that bent to fly,"
20063,LXXXVIII,"When in their ears the deafening horn was wound,"
20064,LXXXVIII,"Not only they the gate unguarded left,"
20065,LXXXVIII,"But from the circus reeled, of wit bereft."
20066,LXXXVIII,
20067,LXXXIX,LXXXIX
20068,LXXXIX,"As family, awaked in sudden wise,"
20069,LXXXIX,"Leaps from the windows and from lofty height,"
20070,LXXXIX,"Periling life and limb, when in surprise"
20071,LXXXIX,"They see, now near, the fire's encircling light,"
20072,LXXXIX,"Which had, while slumber sealed their heavy eyes,"
20073,LXXXIX,By little and by little waxed at night:
20074,LXXXIX,"Reckless of life, thus each, impelled by dread,"
20075,LXXXIX,At sound of that appalling bugle fled.
20076,LXXXIX,
20077,XC,XC
20078,XC,"Above, below, and here and there, the rout"
20079,XC,Rise in confusion and attempt to fly.
20080,XC,"At once, above a thousand swarm about"
20081,XC,"Each entrance, to each other's lett, and lie"
20082,XC,"In heaps: from window these, or stage without,"
20083,XC,Leap headlong; in the press these smothered die.
20084,XC,"Broken is many an arm, and many a head;"
20085,XC,"And one lies crippled, and another dead."
20086,XC,
20087,XCI,XCI
20088,XCI,"Amid the mighty ruin which ensued,"
20089,XCI,Cries pierce the very heavens on every part.
20090,XCI,"Where'er the sound is heard, the multitude,"
20091,XCI,"In panic at the deafening echo, start."
20092,XCI,When you are told that without hardihood
20093,XCI,"Appear the rabble, and of feeble heart,"
20094,XCI,This need not more your marvel; for by nature
20095,XCI,The hare is evermore a timid creature.
20096,XCI,
20097,XCII,XCII
20098,XCII,"But of Marphisa what will be your thought,"
20099,XCII,And Guido late so furious? -- of the two
20100,XCII,"Young sons of Olivier, that lately wrought"
20101,XCII,Such deeds in honour of their lineage?  who
20102,XCII,"Lately a hundred thousand held as nought,"
20103,XCII,"And now, deprived of courage, basely flew,"
20104,XCII,"As ring-doves flutter and as coneys fly,"
20105,XCII,Who hear some mighty noise resounding nigh.
20106,XCII,
20107,XCIII,XCIII
20108,XCIII,"For so to friend as stranger, noxious are"
20109,XCIII,The powers that in the enchanted horn reside.
20110,XCIII,"Sansonet, Guido, follow, with the pair"
20111,XCIII,"Or brethren bold, Marphisa terrified."
20112,XCIII,"Nor flying, can they to such distance fare,"
20113,XCIII,But that their ears are dinned.  On every side
20114,XCIII,"Astolpho, on his foaming courser borne,"
20115,XCIII,Lends louder breath to his enchanted horn.
20116,XCIII,
20117,XCIV,XCIV
20118,XCIV,"One sought the sea, and one the mountain-top,"
20119,XCIV,One fled the hide herself in forest hoar;
20120,XCIV,"And this, who turned not once nor made a stop,"
20121,XCIV,Not for ten days her headlong flight forbore:
20122,XCIV,"These from the bridge in that dread moment drop,"
20123,XCIV,Never to climb the river's margin more.
20124,XCIV,"So temple, house and square and street were drained,"
20125,XCIV,That nigh unpeopled the wide town remained.
20126,XCIV,
20127,XCV,XCV
20128,XCV,"Marphisa, Guido, and the brethren two,"
20129,XCV,"With Sansonetto, pale and trembling, hie"
20130,XCV,"Towards the sea, and behind these the crew"
20131,XCV,Of frighted mariners and merchants fly;
20132,XCV,"And 'twixt the forts, in bark, prepared with view"
20133,XCV,"To their escape, discover Alery;"
20134,XCV,"Who in sore haste receives the warriors pale,"
20135,XCV,And bids them ply their oars and make all sail.
20136,XCV,
20137,XCVI,XCVI
20138,XCVI,The duke within and out the town had bear
20139,XCVI,"From the surrounding hills to the sea-side,"
20140,XCVI,And of its people emptied every street.
20141,XCVI,"All fly before the deafening sound, and hide:"
20142,XCVI,"Many in panic, seeking a retreat,"
20143,XCVI,"Lurk, in some place obscure and filthy stied;"
20144,XCVI,"Many, not knowing whither to repair,"
20145,XCVI,"Plunge in the neighbouring sea, and perish there."
20146,XCVI,
20147,XCVII,XCVII
20148,XCVII,"The duke arrives, seeking the friendly band,"
20149,XCVII,Whom he had hoped to find upon the quay;
20150,XCVII,"He turns and gazes round the desert strand,"
20151,XCVII,And none is there -- directs along the bay
20152,XCVII,"His eyes, and now, far distant from the land,"
20153,XCVII,Beholds the parting frigate under way.
20154,XCVII,"So that the paladin, for his escape --"
20155,XCVII,The vessel gone -- must other project shape.
20156,XCVII,
20157,XCVIII,XCVIII
20158,XCVIII,Let him depart!  nor let it trouble you
20159,XCVIII,That he so long a road must beat alone;
20160,XCVIII,"Where, never without fear, man journeys through"
20161,XCVIII,"Wild paynim countries: danger is there none,"
20162,XCVIII,"But what he with his bugle may eschew,"
20163,XCVIII,Whose dread effect the English duke has shown;
20164,XCVIII,"And let his late companions be our care,"
20165,XCVIII,Who trembling to the beach had made repair.
20166,XCVIII,
20167,XCIX,XCIX
20168,XCIX,They from that cruel and ensanguined ground
20169,XCIX,"To seaward, under all their canvas, bore;"
20170,XCIX,"And having gained such offing, that the sound"
20171,XCIX,"Of that alarming horn was heard no more,"
20172,XCIX,"Unwonted shame inflicted such a wound,"
20173,XCIX,That all a face of burning crimson wore.
20174,XCIX,"One dares not eye the other, and they stand"
20175,XCIX,"With downcast looks, a mute and mournful band."

20181,C,And Malea's fearful headland; fanned by free
20182,C,"And constant wind, sees vanish from the eye"
20183,C,"The Greek Morea; rounding Sicily,"
20184,C,"Into the Tuscan sea his frigate veers,"
20185,C,"And, coasting Italy's fair region, steers:"
20186,C,
20187,CI,CI
20188,CI,"Last rises Luna, where his family"
20189,CI,"Is waiting his return, the patron hoar"
20190,CI,Gives thanks to God at having passed the sea
20191,CI,"Without more harm, and makes the well-known shore."
20192,CI,"Here, offering passage to their company,"
20193,CI,"They find a master, ready to unmoor"
20194,CI,"For France, and that same day his pinnace climb;"
20195,CI,Thence wafted to Marseilles in little time.
20196,CI,
20197,CII,CII
20198,CII,"There was not Bradamant, who used to sway"
20199,CII,"The land, and had that city in her care,"
20200,CII,And who (if present there) to make some stay
20201,CII,Would have compelled them by her courteous prayer.
20202,CII,They disembarked; and that same hour away
20203,CII,Did bold Marphisa at a venture fare;
20204,CII,"Bidding adieu to salvage Guido's wife,"
20205,CII,"And to the four, her comrades in the strife:"
20206,CII,
20207,CIII,CIII
20208,CIII,Saying she deems unfitting for a knight
20209,CIII,To fare in like great fellowship; that so
20210,CIII,"The starlings and the doves in flock unite,"
20211,CIII,And every beast who fears -- the stag and doe;
20212,CIII,"But hawk and eagle, that in other's might"
20213,CIII,"Put not their trust, for ever singly go;"
20214,CIII,"And lion, bear, and tyger, roam alone,"
20215,CIII,Who fear no prowess greater than their own.
20216,CIII,
20217,CIV,CIV
20218,CIV,"But none with her opine, and, in the lack"
20219,CIV,"Of a companion, singly must she fare,"
20220,CIV,"So then, alone and friendless, she a track"
20221,CIV,"Uncouth pursues, and through a wooded lair."
20222,CIV,Gryphon the white and Aquilant the black
20223,CIV,Take road more beaten with the other pair;
20224,CIV,"And on the following day a castle see,"
20225,CIV,Within which they are harboured courteously.
20226,CIV,
20227,CV,CV
20228,CV,"Courteously I, in outward show, would say;"
20229,CV,For soon the contrary was made appear.
20230,CV,"Since he, the castellain, who with display"
20231,CV,"Of kindness sheltered them and courteous cheer,"
20232,CV,The night ensuing took them as they lay
20233,CV,"Couched in their beds, secure and void of fear."
20234,CV,"Nor from the snare would he his prisoners loose,"
20235,CV,Till they had sworn to observe an evil use.
20236,CV,
20237,CVI,CVI
20238,CVI,"But I will first pursue the martial maid,"
20239,CVI,"Ere more of these, fair sir, I shall proclaim."
20240,CVI,"Beyond the Durence, Rhone, and Saone she strayed,"
20241,CVI,And to the foot of sunny mountain came;
20242,CVI,"And there approaching in black gown arrayed,"
20243,CVI,"Beside a torrent, saw an ancient dame;"
20244,CVI,"Who with long journey weak, and wearied sore,"
20245,CVI,"Appeared, but pined by melancholy more."
20246,CVI,
20247,CVII,CVII
20248,CVII,This was the beldam who had wont to ply
20249,CVII,Serving the robbers in the caverned mount;
20250,CVII,Whither stern Justice sent (that they might die
20251,CVII,By that good paladin) Anglante's count.
20252,CVII,"The aged harridan, for cause which I"
20253,CVII,"To you shall in another place recount,"
20254,CVII,"Now many days by path obscure had flown,"
20255,CVII,Still fearing lest her visage should be known.
20256,CVII,
20257,CVIII,CVIII
20258,CVIII,The semblance now of foreign cavalier
20259,CVIII,"She in Marphisa saw, in arms and vest;"
20260,CVIII,"And hence she flies not her, though wont to fear,"
20261,CVIII,(As being natives of that land) the rest;
20262,CVIII,"-- Nay, with security and open cheer,"
20263,CVIII,Stops at the ford the damsel to arrest:
20264,CVIII,Stops at the ford -- where that old beldam meets
20265,CVIII,"Marphisa, and with fair encounter greets."
20266,CVIII,
20267,CIX,CIX
20268,CIX,"And next implored the maid, she of her grace"
20269,CIX,Would bear her on the croupe to the other shore.
20270,CIX,"Marphisa, who was come of gentle race,"
20271,CIX,The hag with her across the torrent bore;
20272,CIX,"And is content to bear, till she can place"
20273,CIX,"In a securer road the beldam hoar,"
20274,CIX,Clear of a spacious marish: as its end
20275,CIX,They see a cavalier towards them wend.
20276,CIX,
20277,CX,CX
20278,CX,"In shining armour and in fair array,"
20279,CX,The warrior rode on saddle richly wrought
20280,CX,"Towards the river, and upon his way"
20281,CX,With him a single squire and damsel brought.
20282,CX,"Of passing beauty was the lady gay,"
20283,CX,But little pleasing was her semblance haught;
20284,CX,"All overblown with insolence and pride,"
20285,CX,Worthy the cavalier who was her guide.
20286,CX,
20287,CXI,CXI
20288,CXI,"He of Maganza was a count, who bore"
20289,CXI,The lady with him (Pinabello hight):
20290,CXI,"The same who Bradamant, some months before,"
20291,CXI,Had plunged into a hollow cave in spite.
20292,CXI,"Those many sobs, those burning sighs and sore,"
20293,CXI,"Those tears which had nigh quenched the warrior's sight, --"
20294,CXI,"All for the damsel were, now at his side;"
20295,CXI,And then by that false necromancer stied.
20296,CXI,
20297,CXII,CXII
20298,CXII,But when the magic tower upon the hill
20299,CXII,"Was razed, the dwelling of Atlantes hoar,"
20300,CXII,"And every one was free to rove at will,"
20301,CXII,"Through Bradamant's good deed and virtuous lore,"
20302,CXII,"The damsel, who had been compliant still"
20303,CXII,"With the desires of Pinabel before,"
20304,CXII,"Rejoined him, and now journeying in a round"
20305,CXII,"With him, from castle was to castle bound."
20306,CXII,
20307,CXIII,CXIII
20308,CXIII,"As wanton and ill-customed, when she spies"
20309,CXIII,"Marphisa's aged charge approaching near,"
20310,CXIII,"She cannot rein her saucy tongue, but plies"
20311,CXIII,"Here, in her petulance, with laugh and jeer."
20312,CXIII,"Marphisa haught, unwont in any wise"
20313,CXIII,"Outrage from whatsoever part to hear,"
20314,CXIII,"Makes answer to the dame, in angry tone,"
20315,CXIII,That handsomer than her she deems the crone.
20316,CXIII,
20317,CXIV,CXIV
20318,CXIV,And that she this would prove upon her knight
20319,CXIV,With pact that she might strip the bonnibell
20320,CXIV,"Of gown and palfrey, if, o'erthrown in fight,"
20321,CXIV,Her champion from his goodly courser fell.
20322,CXIV,-- In silence to have overpast the slight
20323,CXIV,"Would have been sin and shame in Pinabel,"
20324,CXIV,"Who for short answer seized his shield and spear,"
20325,CXIV,"And wheeled, and drove at her in fierce career."
20326,CXIV,
20327,CXV,CXV
20328,CXV,"Marphisa grasped a mighty lance, and thrust,"
20329,CXV,"Encountering him, at Pinabello's eyes;"
20330,CXV,"And stretched him so astounded in the dust,"
20331,CXV,That motionless an hour the warrior lies.
20332,CXV,"Marphisa, now victorious in the just,"
20333,CXV,Gave orders to strip off the glorious guise
20334,CXV,"And ornaments wherewith the maid was drest,"
20335,CXV,And with the spoils her ancient crone invest;
20336,CXV,
20337,CXVI,CXVI
20338,CXVI,"And willed that she should don the youthful weed,"
20339,CXVI,Bedizened at the haughty damsel's cost;
20340,CXVI,And took away as well the goodly steed
20341,CXVI,"Which her had thither borne, and -- bent to post"
20342,CXVI,"On her old track -- with her the hag will speed,"
20343,CXVI,Who seems most hideous when adorned the most.
20344,CXVI,"Three days the tedious road the couple beat,"
20345,CXVI,Without adventure needful to repeat.
20346,CXVI,
20347,CXVII,CXVII
20348,CXVII,"On the fourth day they met a cavalier,"
20349,CXVII,Who came in fury galloping alone.
20350,CXVII,"If you the stranger's name desire to hear,"
20351,CXVII,"I tell you 'twas Zerbino, a king's son,"
20352,CXVII,"Of beauty and of worth example rare,"
20353,CXVII,"Now grieved and angered, as unvenged of one,"
20354,CXVII,"Who a great act of courtesy, which fain"
20355,CXVII,"The warrior would have done, had rendered vain."
20356,CXVII,
20357,CXVIII,CXVIII
20358,CXVIII,"Vainly the young Zerbino, through the glade,"
20359,CXVIII,"Had chased that man of his, who this despite"
20360,CXVIII,"Had done him, who himself so well conveyed"
20361,CXVIII,"Away and took such 'vantage in his flight,"
20362,CXVIII,"So hid by wood and mist, which overlaid"
20363,CXVIII,"The horizon and bedimmed the morning-light,"
20364,CXVIII,"That he escaped Zerbino's grasp, and lay"
20365,CXVIII,Concealed until his wrath was past away.
20366,CXVIII,
20367,CXIX,CXIX
20368,CXIX,"Zerbino laughed parforce, when he descried"
20369,CXIX,"That beldam's face, though he was full of rage;"
20370,CXIX,For too ill-sorted seemed her vest of pride
20371,CXIX,"With her foul visage, more deformed by age;"
20372,CXIX,"And to the proud Marphisa, at her side"
20373,CXIX,"The prince, exclaimed, ""Sir warrior, you are sage,"
20374,CXIX,"In having chosen damsel of a sort,"
20375,CXIX,"Whom none, I ween, will grudge you should escort."""
20376,CXIX,
20377,CXX,CXX
20378,CXX,"Older than Sibyl seemed the beldam hoar,"
20379,CXX,"(As far as from her wrinkles one might guess),"
20380,CXX,"And in the youthful ornaments she wore,"
20381,CXX,Looked like an ape which men in mockery dress;
20382,CXX,"And now appears more foul, as angered sore,"
20383,CXX,While rage and wrath her kindled eyes express.
20384,CXX,For none can do a woman worse despite
20385,CXX,Than to proclaim her old and foul to sight.
20386,CXX,
20387,CXXI,CXXI
20388,CXXI,To have sport of him -- as she had -- an air
20389,CXXI,"Of wrath the maid assumed upon her part,"

21620,XXV,Returned to him whom he was used to obey;
21621,XXV,"Beneath the old enchanter's care to dwell,"
21622,XXV,And stayed with him till broken was the spell.
21623,XXV,
21624,XXVI,XXVI
21625,XXVI,At nought Astolpho could more joyous be
21626,XXVI,Than this; of all things fortunate the best:
21627,XXVI,In that the hippogryph so happily
21628,XXVI,"Offered himself; that he might scower the rest,"
21629,XXVI,"(As much he coveted) of land and sea,"
21630,XXVI,And in few days the ample world invest.
21631,XXVI,"Him well he knew, how fit for his behoof;"
21632,XXVI,For of his feats he had elsewhere made proof.
21633,XXVI,
21634,XXVII,XXVII
21635,XXVII,"Him he that day in India proved, when sped"
21636,XXVII,"He was by sage Melissa, from the reign"
21637,XXVII,"Of that ill woman who him, sore bested,"
21638,XXVII,Had changed from man to myrtle on the plain;
21639,XXVII,Had marked and noted how his giddy head
21640,XXVII,Was formed by Logistilla to the rein;
21641,XXVII,And saw how well instructed by her care
21642,XXVII,"Rogero was, to guide him every where."
21643,XXVII,
21644,XXVIII,XXVIII
21645,XXVIII,"Minded to take the hippogryph, he flung"
21646,XXVIII,"The saddle on him, which lay near, and bitted"
21647,XXVIII,"The steed, by choosing, all the reins among,"
21648,XXVIII,"This part or that, until his mouth was fitted:"
21649,XXVIII,"For in that place were many bridles hung,"
21650,XXVIII,Belonging to the coursers which flitted.
21651,XXVIII,"And now alone, intent upon his flight,"
21652,XXVIII,The thought of Rabicane detained the knight.
21653,XXVIII,
21654,XXIX,XXIX
21655,XXIX,"Good cause he had to love that Rabicane,"
21656,XXIX,"For better horse was not to run with lance,"
21657,XXIX,And him had he from the remotest reign
21658,XXIX,Of India ridden even into France:
21659,XXIX,"After much thought, he to some friend would fain"
21660,XXIX,"Present him, rather than so, left to chance,"
21661,XXIX,"Abandon there the courser, as a prey,"
21662,XXIX,To the first stranger who should pass that way.
21663,XXIX,
21664,XXX,XXX
21665,XXX,He stood upon the watch if he could view
21666,XXX,"Some hunter in the forest, or some hind,"
21667,XXX,"To whom he might commit the charge, and who"
21668,XXX,Might to some city lead the horse behind.
21669,XXX,He waited all that day and till the new
21670,XXX,"Had dawned, when, while the twilight yet was blind,"
21671,XXX,"He thought he saw, as he expecting stood,"
21672,XXX,A cavalier approaching through the wood.
21673,XXX,
21674,XXXI,XXXI
21675,XXXI,"But it behoves that, ere the rest I say,"
21676,XXXI,I Bradamant and good Rogero find.
21677,XXXI,"After the horn had ceased, and, far away,"
21678,XXXI,"The beauteous pair had left the dome behind,"
21679,XXXI,"Rogero looked, and knew what till that day"
21680,XXXI,"He had seen not, by Atlantes rendered blind."
21681,XXXI,"Atlantes had effected by his power,"
21682,XXXI,They should not know each other till that hour.
21683,XXXI,
21684,XXXII,XXXII
21685,XXXII,"Rogero looks on Bradamant, and she"
21686,XXXII,Looks on Rogero in profound surprise
21687,XXXII,That for so many days that witchery
21688,XXXII,Had so obscurred her altered mind and eyes.
21689,XXXII,"Rejoiced, Rogero clasps his lady free,"
21690,XXXII,"Crimsoning with deeper than the rose's dyes,"
21691,XXXII,"And his fair love's first blossoms, while he clips"
21692,XXXII,"The gentle damsel, gathers from her lips."
21693,XXXII,
21694,XXXIII,XXXIII
21695,XXXIII,"A thousand times they their embrace renew,"
21696,XXXIII,And closely each is by the other prest;
21697,XXXIII,"While so delighted are those lovers two,"
21698,XXXIII,Their joys are ill contained within their breast.
21699,XXXIII,"Deluded by enchantments, much they rue"
21700,XXXIII,"That while they were within the wizard's rest,"
21701,XXXIII,"They should not e'er have one another known,"
21702,XXXIII,And have so many happy days foregone.
21703,XXXIII,
21704,XXXIV,XXXIV
21705,XXXIV,"The gentle Bradamant, who was i' the vein"
21706,XXXIV,"To grant whatever prudent virgin might,"
21707,XXXIV,"To solace her desiring lover's pain,"
21708,XXXIV,So that her honour should receive no slight;
21709,XXXIV,"-- If the last fruits he of her love would gain,"
21710,XXXIV,"Nor find her ever stubborn, bade the knight,"
21711,XXXIV,Her of Duke Aymon through fair mean demand;
21712,XXXIV,But be baptized before he claimed her hand.
21713,XXXIV,
21714,XXXV,XXXV
21715,XXXV,"Rogero good, who not alone to be"
21716,XXXV,"A Christian for the love of her were fain,"
21717,XXXV,"As his good sire had been, and anciently"
21718,XXXV,"His grandsire and his whole illustrious strain,"
21719,XXXV,But for her pleasure would immediately
21720,XXXV,"Resign whatever did of life remain,"
21721,XXXV,"Says, ""I not only, if 'tis thy desire,"
21722,XXXV,"Will be baptized by water, but by fire."""
21723,XXXV,
21724,XXXVI,XXXVI
21725,XXXVI,"Then on his way to be baptized he hied,"
21726,XXXVI,"That he might next espouse the martial may,"
21727,XXXVI,With Bradamant; who served him as a guide
21728,XXXVI,"To Vallombrosa's fane, an abbey gray,"
21729,XXXVI,"Rich, fair, nor less religious, and beside,"
21730,XXXVI,Courteous to whosoever passed that way;
21731,XXXVI,"And they encountered, issuing from the chase,"
21732,XXXVI,"A woman, with a passing woful face."
21733,XXXVI,
21734,XXXVII,XXXVII
21735,XXXVII,"Rogero, as still courteous, still humane"
21736,XXXVII,"To all, but woman most, when he discerned"
21737,XXXVII,Her dainty visage furrowed by a rain
21738,XXXVII,"Of lovely tears, sore pitied her, and burned"
21739,XXXVII,With the desire to know her grievous pain;
21740,XXXVII,"And having to the mournful lady turned,"
21741,XXXVII,"Besought her, after fair salute, to show"
21742,XXXVII,What cause had made her eyes thus overflow.
21743,XXXVII,
21744,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
21745,XXXVIII,"And she, uplifting their moist rays and bright,"
21746,XXXVIII,Most kindly to the inquiring Child replied;
21747,XXXVIII,"And of the cause of her unhappy plight,"
21748,XXXVIII,"Him, since he sought it, fully satisfied."
21749,XXXVIII,"""Thou hast to understand, O gentle knight,"
21750,XXXVIII,"My visage is so bathed with tears,"" she cried,"
21751,XXXVIII,"""In pity to a youth condemned to die"
21752,XXXVIII,"This very day, within a town hard by."

21759,XXXIX,"With her each night the amorous stripling lay,"
21760,XXXIX,Nor any had suspicion of the twain:
21761,XXXIX,"But nought so hidden is, but searching eye"

21768,XL,"Gave order to surprise the pair in bed,"
21769,XL,"And in the citadel the prisoners new,"
21770,XL,To separate dungeons in that fortress led;
21771,XL,Nor think I that enough of day remains
21772,XL,To save the lover from his cruel pains.
21773,XL,
21774,XLI,XLI
21775,XLI,"""I fled, not to behold such cruelty,"

21779,XLI,Or that hereafter thing can pleasure me

21783,XLI,
21784,XLII,XLII
21785,XLII,"Touched deeply, Bradamant his danger hears,"
21786,XLII,In heart sore troubled at the story shown;
21787,XLII,"As anxious for the lover, it appears,"
21788,XLII,As if he were a brother of her own:
21789,XLII,"Nor certes wholly causeless are her fears,"
21790,XLII,"As in an after verse will be made known,"
21791,XLII,"Then, to Rogero: ""Him to keep from harms,"
21792,XLII,"Meseems we worthily should turn our arms."""
21793,XLII,
21794,XLIII,XLIII
21795,XLIII,And to that melancholy damsel said:
21796,XLIII,"""Place us but once within the walls, and I,"
21797,XLIII,"So that the youth be not already dead,"
21798,XLIII,"Will be your warrant that he shall not die."""
21799,XLIII,"Rogero, who the kindly bosom read"
21800,XLIII,"Of Bradamant, still full of piety,"
21801,XLIII,Felt himself but all over with desire

21817,XLV,"That hope, which long had ceased to be her stay,"
21818,XLV,Again upon the grieving dame bestowed:
21819,XLV,"But, for she less the distance of the way"
21820,XLV,"Dreaded, than interruption of the road,"
21821,XLV,"Lest they, through this, should take that path in vain,"

21828,XLVI,Before the fire was lit; but we must strain
21829,XLVI,"By path so foul and crooked, that a day"
21830,XLVI,To reach the city would suffice with pain;

22188,LXXXII,Was to that soberer region on his way!
22189,LXXXII,"Last, when the unsated Orc upon the main,"
22190,LXXXII,"By this astounded, 'mid the sea-foam lay;"

22198,LXXXIII,If he in need of its good succour lies.
22199,LXXXIII,"With this, as said before, he came a-field"

22414,V,"To wander by close path the lady sent,"
22415,V,"Until the western sun withdrew his light,"
22416,V,Abandoning the world above to night.
22417,V,
22418,VI,VI
22419,VI,"Nor knowing where for shelter she should rove,"
22420,VI,"Bradamant in that place resolves to stay,"
22421,VI,Couched on the verdant herbage of the grove;
22422,VI,"And, sleeping, now awaits the dawn of day,"
22423,VI,"Now watching Saturn, Venus, Mars, and Jove,"
22424,VI,And the other wandering gods upon their way:
22425,VI,"But, whether waking or to sleep resigned,"
22426,VI,Has aye Rogero present to her mind.
22427,VI,
22428,VII,VII
22429,VII,"With sorrow and repentance oft assailed,"
22430,VII,"She from her inmost heart profoundly sighed,"
22431,VII,That Anger over Love should have prevailed.
22432,VII,"""Anger has torn me from my love,"" (she cried,)"
22433,VII,"""Oh!  had I made some note, which had availed,"
22434,VII,"Thither, whence I set out, my steps to guide,"
22435,VII,When I departed on my ill emprize!
22436,VII,"Sure I was lorn of memory and of eyes!"""
22437,VII,
22438,VIII,VIII
22439,VIII,These words and others she in mournful strain
22440,VIII,"Utters, and broods within her heart on more."
22441,VIII,"Meanwhile a wind of sighs, and plenteous rain"
22442,VIII,"Of tears, are tokens of her anguish sore."
22443,VIII,"In the east, at last, expected long in vain,"
22444,VIII,The wished for twilight streaked the horizon o'er;
22445,VIII,"And she her courser took, which on the ley"
22446,VIII,"Was feeding, and rode forth to meet the day."
22447,VIII,
22448,IX,IX
22449,IX,"Nor far had rode, ere from the greenwood-trees"
22450,IX,"She issued, where the dome was erst displayed;"
22451,IX,And many days her with such witcheries
22452,IX,The evil-minded wizard had delayed.
22453,IX,"Here she Astolpho found, who at full ease"
22454,IX,"A bridle for the Hippogryph had made,"
22455,IX,"And here was standing, thoughtful and in pain"
22456,IX,To whom he should deliver Rabicane.
22457,IX,
22458,X,X
22459,X,"By chance she found him, as the cavalier"
22460,X,Had from the helm uncased his head to view;
22461,X,"So that when of the dingy forest clear,"
22462,X,Fair Bradamant her gentle cousin knew.
22463,X,"Him from afar she hailed with joyful cheer,"
22464,X,"And now more nigh, to embrace the warrior flew;"
22465,X,"And named herself, and raised her vizor high,"
22466,X,And let him plainly who she was espy.
22467,X,
22468,XI,XI
22469,XI,None could Astolpho have found any where
22470,XI,"With whom to leave his horse with more content,"
22471,XI,"As knowing she would guard the steed with care,"
22472,XI,And to his lord on his return present;
22473,XI,"And he believed that Heaven had, in its care,"
22474,XI,Duke Aymon's daughter for this pleasure sent.
22475,XI,"Her was he wont with pleasure aye to see,"
22476,XI,But now with more in his necessity.
22477,XI,
22478,XII,XII
22479,XII,"Embracing twice or thrice the cousins stand,"
22480,XII,"Fraternally, each other's neck, and they"
22481,XII,Had of each other's welfare made demand
22482,XII,"With much affection, ere the duke 'gan say;"
22483,XII,"""Would I now see the winged people's land,"
22484,XII,"Here upon earth I make too long delay."""
22485,XII,"And opening to the dame the thought he brewed,"
22486,XII,To her the flying horse Astolpho shewed.
22487,XII,
22488,XIII,XIII
22489,XIII,But she scarce marvelled when above the plain
22490,XIII,She saw the rising steed his wings unfold;
22491,XIII,"Since upon former time, with mastering rein."
22492,XIII,On him had charged the dame that wizard old;
22493,XIII,"And made her eye and eyelid sorely strain,"
22494,XIII,"So hard she gazed, his movements to behold;"
22495,XIII,"The day that he bore off, with wonderous range,"
22496,XIII,"Rogero on his journey, long and strange."
22497,XIII,
22498,XIV,XIV
22499,XIV,Astolpho says on her he will bestow
22500,XIV,"His Rabican; so passing swift of kind,"
22501,XIV,"That, if the courser started when a bow"
22502,XIV,"Was drawn, he left the feathered shaft behind;"
22503,XIV,"And will as well his panoply forego,"
22504,XIV,That it may to Mount Alban be consigned:
22505,XIV,And she for him preserve the martial weed;
22506,XIV,Since of his arms he has no present need.
22507,XIV,
22508,XV,XV
22509,XV,"Bent, since a course in air was to be flown,"
22510,XV,"That he, as best he can, will make him light."
22511,XV,Yet keeps the sword and horn; although alone
22512,XV,The horn from every risque might shield the knight:
22513,XV,"But he the lance abandons, which the son"
22514,XV,Of Galaphron was wont to bear in flight;
22515,XV,"The lance, by which whoever in the course"
22516,XV,"Was touched, fell headlong hurtling from his horse."
22517,XV,
22518,XVI,XVI
22519,XVI,"Backed by Astolpho, and ascending slow,"
22520,XVI,The hippogryph through yielding aether flew;
22521,XVI,"And next the rider stirred the courser so,"
22522,XVI,That in a thought he vanished out of view.
22523,XVI,"Thus with his pilot does the patron go,"
22524,XVI,"Fearing the gale and rock, till he is through"
22525,XVI,"The reefs; then, having left the shore behind,"
22526,XVI,"Hoists every sail, and shoots before the wind."
22527,XVI,
22528,XVII,XVII
22529,XVII,"Bradamant, when departed was the peer,"
22530,XVII,Remained distressed in mind; since in what way
22531,XVII,She knew not her good kinsman's warlike gear
22532,XVII,And courser to Mount Alban to convey.
22533,XVII,"For on her heart, which they inflame and tear,"
22534,XVII,The warm desire and greedy will yet prey
22535,XVII,To see the Child; whom she to find once more
22536,XVII,"At Vallombrosa thought, if not before."
22537,XVII,
22538,XVIII,XVIII
22539,XVIII,"Here standing in suspense, by chance she spied"
22540,XVIII,"A churl, that came towards her on the plain,"
22541,XVIII,"Who, at her best, Astolpho's armour tied,"
22542,XVIII,"As best he might, and laid on Rabicane;"
22543,XVIII,She next behind her bade the peasant guide
22544,XVIII,(One courser loaded and one loose) the twain.
22545,XVIII,"Two were the steeds; for she had that before,"
22546,XVIII,On which his horse from Pinnabel she bore.
22547,XVIII,
22548,XIX,XIX
22549,XIX,To Vallombrosa to direct her way
22550,XIX,"She thought, in hopes to find Rogero there:"
22551,XIX,"But, fearing evermore to go astray,"
22552,XIX,Knew not how thither she might best repair.
22553,XIX,"The churl had of the country small assay,"
22554,XIX,"And, sure to be bewildered, wend the pair:"
22555,XIX,"Yet at a venture thitherward she hies,"
22556,XIX,Where she believes the place of meeting lies.
22557,XIX,
22558,XX,XX
22559,XX,"She here and there, as she her way pursued,"
22560,XX,"Turned, but found none to question of the road;"
22561,XX,"She saw at mid-day, issuing from the wood,"
22562,XX,"A fort, nor far removed was the abode,"
22563,XX,"Which on the summit of a mountain stood,"
22564,XX,And to the lady like Mount Alban showed;
22565,XX,And was Mount Alban sure; in which repair
22566,XX,One of her brothers and her mother were.
22567,XX,
22568,XXI,XXI
22569,XXI,"She, when she recognized the place, became"
22570,XXI,Sadder at heart than I have power to say.
22571,XXI,"If she delays, discovered is the dame,"
22572,XXI,Nor thence will be allowed to wend her way:
22573,XXI,"If thence she wends not, of the amorous flame"
22574,XXI,"Which so consumes her, she will be the prey,"
22575,XXI,"Nor see Rogero more, nor compass aught"
22576,XXI,Which was at Vallombrosa to be wrought.
22577,XXI,
22578,XXII,XXII
22579,XXII,"Some deal she doubted: then to turn her steed,"
22580,XXII,Resolved upon Mount Alban's castle near;
22581,XXII,"And, for she thence her way could deftly read,"
22582,XXII,Her course anew towards the abbey steer.
22583,XXII,"But Fortune, good or evil, had decreed"
22584,XXII,"The maid, before she of the vale was clear,"
22585,XXII,"Of one of her good brethren should be spied,"
22586,XXII,"Alardo named, ere she had time to hide."
22587,XXII,
22588,XXIII,XXIII
22589,XXIII,He came from billeting the bands which lay
22590,XXIII,"Dispersed about that province, foot and horse;"
22591,XXIII,"For the surrounding district, to obey"
22592,XXIII,"King Charlemagne, had raised another force."
22593,XXIII,"Embraces brotherly and friendly say,"
22594,XXIII,"Salutes and kindly cheer, ensue of course;"
22595,XXIII,"And next into Mount Alban, side by side,"
22596,XXIII,"They, communing of many matters, ride."
22597,XXIII,
22598,XXIV,XXIV
22599,XXIV,"Bradamant enters Montalbano's seat,"
22600,XXIV,"Whom Beatrice had mourned, and vainly sought"
22601,XXIV,"Through spacious France: 'Tis here all welcome sweet,"
22602,XXIV,"The kiss and clasp of hand, she holds at nought,"
22603,XXIV,"While her a mother and a brother greet,"
22604,XXIV,As the enamoured maid compares in thought
22605,XXIV,These with the loved Rogero's fond embrace;
22606,XXIV,Which time will never from her mind efface.
22607,XXIV,
22608,XXV,XXV
22609,XXV,"Because she could not go, one in her stead"
22610,XXV,"To send to Vallombrosa she devised,"
22611,XXV,Who thither in the damsel's name should speed;
22612,XXV,By whom should young Rogero be apprised
22613,XXV,"What kept her thence; and prayed, if prayer should need,"
22614,XXV,That there he for love would be baptised;
22615,XXV,"And next, as was concerned, would intend"
22616,XXV,What might their bridal bring to happy end.
22617,XXV,
22618,XXVI,XXVI
22619,XXVI,She purposed the same messenger should bear
22620,XXVI,As well to her Rogero his good steed;
22621,XXVI,"Which he was ever wonted to hold dear,"
22622,XXVI,Worthily dear; for sure so stout at need
22623,XXVI,"And beauteous was no courser, far or near,"
22624,XXVI,"In land of Christian or of Paynim creed,"
22625,XXVI,In occupation of the Gaul or Moor;
22626,XXVI,Except Baiardo good and Brigliador.
22627,XXVI,
22628,XXVII,XXVII
22629,XXVII,"Valiant Rogero, when too bold of sprite"
22630,XXVII,"He backed the hippogryph and soared in air,"
22631,XXVII,"Frontino left (Frontino he was hight),"
22632,XXVII,"Whom Bradamant then took into her care,"
22633,XXVII,"And to Mount Alban sent; and had him dight,"
22634,XXVII,"And nourished, at large cost, with plenteous fare;"
22635,XXVII,"Nor let be rode except at easy pace,"
22636,XXVII,Hence was he ne'er so sleek or well in case.
22637,XXVII,
22638,XXVIII,XXVIII
22639,XXVIII,"Each damsel and each dame who her obeyed,"
22640,XXVIII,"She tasked, together with herself, to sew,"
22641,XXVIII,With subtle toil; and with fine gold o'erlaid
22642,XXVIII,A piece of silk of white and sable hue:
22643,XXVIII,"With this she trapt the horse; then chose a maid,"
22644,XXVIII,"Old Callitrephia's daughter, from the crew;"
22645,XXVIII,Whose mother whilom Bradamant had nursed;
22646,XXVIII,A damsel she in all her secrets versed.
22647,XXVIII,
22648,XXIX,XXIX
22649,XXIX,"How graven in her heart Rogero lies,"
22650,XXIX,A thousand times to her she had confessed;
22651,XXIX,And had extolled above the deities
22652,XXIX,"The manners, worth, and beauty be possessed."
22653,XXIX,"""No better messenger could I devise,"""
22654,XXIX,"(She said, and called the damsel from the rest,)"
22655,XXIX,"""Nor have I one, Hippalca mine, more sage"
22656,XXIX,"And sure than three, to do my embassage."""

22658,XXX,XXX
22659,XXX,Hippalca was the attendant damsel hight.
22660,XXX,"""Go,"" (says her lady, and describes the way)"
22661,XXX,And afterwards informs the maid aright
22662,XXX,Of all which to Rogero she should say;
22663,XXX,"And why she at the abbey failed the knight,"
22664,XXX,"Who must not to bad faith ascribe her stay,"
22665,XXX,"But this to Fortune charge, that so decides,"
22666,XXX,"Who, more than we ourselves, our conduct guides."
22667,XXX,
22668,XXXI,XXXI
22669,XXXI,"She made the damsel mount upon a pad,"
22670,XXXI,And put into her hand Frontino's rein;
22671,XXXI,"And, if she met with one so rude or mad,"
22672,XXXI,"Who to deprive her of the steed were fain,"
22673,XXXI,"Her to proclaim who was his owner, bade,"
22674,XXXI,As that which might suffice to make him sane.
22675,XXXI,"For she believed there was no cavalier,"
22676,XXXI,But that Rogero's name would make him fear.
22677,XXXI,
22678,XXXII,XXXII
22679,XXXII,"Of many and many things, whereof to treat"
22680,XXXII,"With good Rogero, in her stead, she showed;"
22681,XXXII,"Of which instructed well, her palfrey fleet"
22682,XXXII,"Hippalca stirred, nor longer there abode."
22683,XXXII,"Through highway, field, and wood, a gloomy beat,"
22684,XXXII,"More than ten weary miles the damsel rode,"
22685,XXXII,"Ere any crossed her path on mischief bent,"
22686,XXXII,Or even questioned witherward she went.
22687,XXXII,
22688,XXXIII,XXXIII
22689,XXXIII,"At noon of day, descending from a mount,"
22690,XXXIII,"She in a streight and ill declivity,"
22691,XXXIII,"Led by a dwarf, encountered Rodomont,"
22692,XXXIII,Who was afoot and harnessed cap-a-pee.
22693,XXXIII,"The Moor towards her raised his haughty front,"
22694,XXXIII,"And straight blasphemed the eternal Hierarchy,"
22695,XXXIII,"That horse, so richly trapped and passing fair,"
22696,XXXIII,He had not found in a knight-errant's care.
22697,XXXIII,
22698,XXXIV,XXXIV
22699,XXXIV,"On the first courser he should find, the knight"
22700,XXXIV,Had sworn a solemn oath his hands to lay:
22701,XXXIV,"This was the first, nor he on steed could light"
22702,XXXIV,Fairer or fitter; yet to take away
22703,XXXIV,The charger from a maid were foul despite.
22704,XXXIV,"Doubtful he stands, but covets sore the prey;"
22705,XXXIV,"Eyes and surveys him, and says often, ""Why"
22706,XXXIV,"Is not as well the courser's master by?"""
22707,XXXIV,
22708,XXXV,XXXV
22709,XXXV,"""Ah!  would be were!"" to him the maid replied,"
22710,XXXV,"""For haply he would make thee change thy thought."
22711,XXXV,"A better knight than thee the horse doth ride,"
22712,XXXV,"And vainly would his match on earth be sought."""
22713,XXXV,"-- ""Who tramples thus on other's fame?"" -- he cried;"
22714,XXXV,"And she -- ""Rogero"" -- said, as she was taught."
22715,XXXV,"Then Rodomont -- ""The steed I may my own;"
22716,XXXV,Since him a champion rides of such renown.
22717,XXXV,
22718,XXXVI,XXXVI
22719,XXXVI,"""If he, as you relate, be of such force,"
22720,XXXVI,"That he surprises all beside in might,"
22721,XXXVI,I needs must pay the hire as well as horse;
22722,XXXVI,And be this at the pleasure of the knight!
22723,XXXVI,"That I am Rodomont, to him discourse;"
22724,XXXVI,"And, if indeed with me he lists to fight,"
22725,XXXVI,"Me shall to find; in that I shine confest,"
22726,XXXVI,"By my own light, in motion or at rest."
22727,XXXVI,
22728,XXXVII,XXXVII
22729,XXXVII,"""I leave such vestige wheresoe'er I tread,"
22730,XXXVII,"The volleyed thunder leaves not worse below."""
22731,XXXVII,"He had thrown back, over Frontino's head,"
22732,XXXVII,"The courser's gilded reins, in saying so,"
22733,XXXVII,"Backed him, and left Hippalca sore bested;"
22734,XXXVII,"Who, bathed in tears, and goaded by her woe,"
22735,XXXVII,"Cries shame on him, and threats the king with ill:"
22736,XXXVII,"Rodomont hearkens not, and climbs the hill:"
22737,XXXVII,

22739,XXXVIII,Whither the dwarf conducts him on the trace
22740,XXXVIII,Of Doralice and Mandricardo bold.
22741,XXXVIII,"Behind, Hippalca him in ceaseless chase,"
22742,XXXVIII,Pursues with taunt and curses manifold.
22743,XXXVIII,What came of this is said in other place.
22744,XXXVIII,"Turpin, by whom this history is told,"
22745,XXXVIII,"Here makes digression, and returns again"

22752,XXXIX,"Zerbino came, with that deceitful crone,"
22753,XXXIX,And saw the bleeding body where it lay:
22754,XXXIX,"And, though the warrior was to him unknown,"
22755,XXXIX,"As good and courteous, felt his bosom swell,"

22763,XL,A print of recent footsteps to explore
22764,XL,The cavalier of Scotland was not slow;

22773,XLI,"Who willed not aught, that in her sight was dear,"

22852,XLIX,Said that Zerbino did the deed; and drew
22853,XLIX,"The girdle forth, to witness to her lies;"
22854,XLIX,Which straight the miserable father knew;
22855,XLIX,And on the woman's tale and token built
22856,XLIX,A clear assurance of Zerbino's guilt.

22912,LV,She asked Orlando what might be the train?
22913,LV,"""I know not,"" said the Count; and left the maid"
22914,LV,"Upon the height, and hurried towards the plain."
22915,LV,"He marked Zerbino, and at the first sight"
22916,LV,"A baron of high worth esteemed the knight,"
22917,LV,
22918,LVI,LVI
22919,LVI,And asked him why and wherefore him they led
22920,LVI,"Thus captive, to Zerbino drawing near:"
22921,LVI,"At this the doleful prince upraised his head,"
22922,LVI,"And, having better heard the cavalier,"
22923,LVI,"Rehearsed the truth; and this so well he said,"
22924,LVI,That he deserved the succour of the peer.
22925,LVI,"Well Sir Orlando him, by his reply,"

22931,LVII,"Was certain 'twas and outrage manifest,"
22932,LVII,"Since nought but ill could spring from him; and one,"
22933,LVII,"Moreover, was the other's foe profest,"
22934,LVII,"From ancient hate and enmity, which run"
22935,LVII,In Clermont and Maganza's blood; a feud

22952,LIX,Against Orlando in that combat sore.
22953,LIX,Against the churl's right cheek the weapon went:
22954,LIX,"It failed indeed his tempered helm to bore,"
22955,LIX,"But such a shock he suffered in the strife,"
22956,LIX,"As broke his neck, and stretched him void of life."

22959,LX,"All at one course, of other of the band,"
22960,LX,"With lance unmoved, he pierced the bosom through;"

22963,LX,"One head in twain he severed with the brand,"
22964,LX,"(While, from the shoulders lopt, another flew)"
22965,LX,Of many pierced the throat; and in a breath
22966,LX,Above a hundred broke and put to death.
22967,LX,
22968,LXI,LXI
22969,LXI,"Above a third he killed, and chased the rest,"

22972,LXI,One with spontoon or bill the champaign strewed
22973,LXI,"This one along the road, across it prest"
22974,LXI,A fourth; this squats in cavern or in wood.
22975,LXI,"Orlando, without pity, on that day"
22976,LXI,Lets none escape whom he has power to slay.

22978,LXII,LXII
22979,LXII,"Of a hundred men and twenty, in that crew,"
22980,LXII,(So Turpin sums them) eighty died at least.
22981,LXII,"Thither Orlando finally withdrew,"
22982,LXII,"Where, with a heart sore trembling in his breast,"
22983,LXII,Zerbino sat; how he at Roland's view
22984,LXII,"Rejoiced, in verse can hardly be exprest:"
22985,LXII,"Who, but that he was on the hackney bound,"
22986,LXII,Would at his feet have cast himself to ground.
22987,LXII,
22988,LXIII,LXIII
22989,LXIII,"While Roland, after he had loosed the knight,"

22992,LXIII,"Himself with the good harness, to his pain;"
22993,LXIII,"The prince on Isabella turned his sight,"
22994,LXIII,Who had halted on the hill above the plain:
22995,LXIII,"And, after she perceived the strife was o'er,"
22996,LXIII,Nearer the field of fight her beauties bore.
22997,LXIII,
22998,LXIV,LXIV
22999,LXIV,When young Zerbino at his side surveyed
23000,LXIV,"The lady, who by him was held so dear;"

23005,LXIV,"But the chill quickly past, and he, instead,"

23009,LXV,"From quickly clipping her in his embrace,"
23010,LXV,Him reverence for Anglantes' sovereign stayed;
23011,LXV,"Because he thought, and held for certain case,"
23012,LXV,That Roland was a lover of the maid;
23013,LXV,So past from pain to pain; and little space
23014,LXV,Endured the joy which he at first assayed.
23015,LXV,"And worse he bore she should another's be,"
23016,LXV,Than hearing that the maid was drowned at sea.
23017,LXV,
23018,LXVI,LXVI
23019,LXVI,"And worse he grieved, that she was with a knight"
23020,LXVI,To whom he owed so much: because to wrest
23021,LXVI,"The lady from his hand, was neither right,"
23022,LXVI,Nor yet perhaps would prove an easy quest.
23023,LXVI,"He, without quarrel, had no other wight"
23024,LXVI,"Suffered to part, of such a prize possest;"
23025,LXVI,"But would endure, Orlando (such his debt)"
23026,LXVI,A foot upon his prostrate neck should set.

23029,LXVII,"The three in silence journey to a font,"
23030,LXVII,"Where they alight, and halt beside the well;"
23031,LXVII,"His helmet here undid the weary Count,"
23032,LXVII,And made the prince too quit the iron shell.
23033,LXVII,"The youth unhelmed, she sees her lover's front,"
23034,LXVII,And pale with sudden joy grows Isabel:
23035,LXVII,"Then, changing, brightened like a humid flower,"
23036,LXVII,When the warm sun succeeds to drenching shower.
23037,LXVII,
23038,LXVIII,LXVIII
23039,LXVIII,"And without more delay or scruple, prest"
23040,LXVIII,To cast her arms about her lover dear;

23042,LXVIII,But bathed his neck and face with briny tear.
23043,LXVIII,"Orlando, who remarked the love exprest,"
23044,LXVIII,"Needing no more to make the matter clear,"

23052,LXIX,Late shown her by Anglantes' cavalier.
23053,LXIX,"The prince, who in one scale weighed Isabel,"
23054,LXIX,"Together with his life, esteemed as dear, --"
23055,LXIX,"Fell at Orlando's feet and him adored,"
23056,LXIX,As to two lives at once by him restored.

23073,LXXI,"Though afterwards less eager to pursue,"
23074,LXXI,Since he with him fair Doralice had led;
23075,LXXI,"Whom from a hundred men, in plate and chain,"
23076,LXXI,"He, with a single staff of oak, had ta'en."
23077,LXXI,
23078,LXXII,LXXII
23079,LXXII,Yet knew not that it was Anglantes' peer

24025,XXIX,Astounded for a while the prince stood by;
24026,XXIX,"Wondering, that he who least should have offended,"
24027,XXIX,Had him requited with such treachery:
24028,XXIX,"But, his long fit of admiration ended,"
24029,XXIX,"Waking from his amazement with a sigh,"
24030,XXIX,"Questioned the prisoner in the horsemen's hold,"
24031,XXIX,It that was true the cavalier had told.
24032,XXIX,
24033,XXX,XXX
24034,XXX,"The faithless man alighted, and down fell"
24035,XXX,"Upon his bended knees, and answered: ""Sir,"
24036,XXX,"All people that on middle earth do dwell,"
24037,XXX,"Through weakness of their nature, sin and err."
24038,XXX,One thing alone distinguishes the well
24039,XXX,"And evil doer; this, at every stir"
24040,XXX,"Of least desire, submits, without a blow;"
24041,XXX,"That arms, but yields as well to stronger foe."
24042,XXX,
24043,XXXI,XXXI
24044,XXXI,"""Had I been charged some castle to maintain,"
24045,XXXI,"And, without contest, on the first assault,"
24046,XXXI,"Hoisted the banners of the hostile train,"
24047,XXXI,"-- For cowardice, or treason, fouler fault --"
24048,XXXI,Upon my eyes (a well deserved pain)
24049,XXXI,Thou might'st have justly closed the darksome vault;
24050,XXXI,"But, yielding to superior force, I read"
24051,XXXI,"I should not merit blame, but praise and meed."
24052,XXXI,
24053,XXXII,XXXII
24054,XXXII,"""The stronger is the enemy, the more"
24055,XXXII,Easily is the vanquished side excused:
24056,XXXII,"I could but faith maintain as, girded sore,"
24057,XXXII,The leaguered fort to keep her faith is used;
24058,XXXII,"Even so, with all the sense, with all the lore"
24059,XXXII,"By sovereign wisdom into me infused,"
24060,XXXII,"This I essayed to keep; but in the end,"
24061,XXXII,"To o'ermastering assault was forced to bend."""
24062,XXXII,
24063,XXXIII,XXXIII
24064,XXXIII,So said Sir Odoric; and after showed
24065,XXXIII,(Though 'twere too tedious to recount his suit)
24066,XXXIII,"Him no light cause had stirred, but puissant goad."
24067,XXXIII,-- If ever earnestness of prayer could boot
24068,XXXIII,"To melt a heart that with resentment glowed,"
24069,XXXIII,"-- If e'er humility produced good fruit,"
24070,XXXIII,It well might here avail; since all that best
24071,XXXIII,"Moves a hard heart, Sir Odoric now exprest."
24072,XXXIII,
24073,XXXIV,XXXIV
24074,XXXIV,"Whether or no to venge such infamy,"
24075,XXXIV,Youthful Zerbino doubted: the review
24076,XXXIV,Of faithless Odorico's treachery
24077,XXXIV,Moved him to death the felon to pursue;
24078,XXXIV,The recollection of the amity
24079,XXXIV,"So long maintained between them, with the dew"
24080,XXXIV,"Of pity cooled the fury in his mind,"
24081,XXXIV,And him to mercy towards the wretch inclined.
24082,XXXIV,
24083,XXXV,XXXV
24084,XXXV,While Scotland's prince is doubting in such wise
24085,XXXV,"To keep him captive, or to loose his chain;"
24086,XXXV,"Or to remove him from before his eyes,"
24087,XXXV,"By dooming him to die, or live in pain;"
24088,XXXV,"Loud neighing, thitherward the palfrey hies"
24089,XXXV,From which the Tartar king had stript the rein;
24090,XXXV,"And the old harridan, who had before"
24091,XXXV,"Nigh caused Zerbino's death, among them bore."
24092,XXXV,
24093,XXXVI,XXXVI
24094,XXXVI,"The horse, that had the others of that band"
24095,XXXVI,"Heard at a distance, thither her conveyed."
24096,XXXVI,"Sore weeping came the old woman, and demand"
24097,XXXVI,"For succour, in her trouble, vainly made."
24098,XXXVI,"Zerbino, when he saw her, raised his hand"
24099,XXXVI,"To heaven, that had to him such grace displayed,"
24100,XXXVI,Giving him to decide that couple's fate;
24101,XXXVI,The only two that had deserved his hate.
24102,XXXVI,
24103,XXXVII,XXXVII
24104,XXXVII,"The wicked hag is kept, so bids the peer,"
24105,XXXVII,Until he is determined what to do:
24106,XXXVII,He to cut off her nose and either ear
24107,XXXVII,"Now thought, and her as an example shew."
24108,XXXVII,"Next, 'twere far better, deemed the cavalier,"
24109,XXXVII,If to the vultures he her carcase threw:
24110,XXXVII,"He diverse punishments awhile revolved,"
24111,XXXVII,And thus the warrior finally resolved.
24112,XXXVII,
24113,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
24114,XXXVIII,"He to his comrades turned him round, and said:"
24115,XXXVIII,"""To let the traitour live I am content,"
24116,XXXVIII,"Who, if full grace he has not merited,"
24117,XXXVIII,Yet merits not to be so foully shent.
24118,XXXVIII,"I, as I find his fault of Love was bred,"
24119,XXXVIII,To give him life and liberty consent;
24120,XXXVIII,"And easily we all excuses own,"
24121,XXXVIII,When on commanding Love the blame is thrown.
24122,XXXVIII,
24123,XXXIX,XXXIX
24124,XXXIX,"""Often has Love turned upside down a brain"
24125,XXXIX,"Of sounder wit than that to him assigned,"
24126,XXXIX,"And led to mischief of far deeper stain,"
24127,XXXIX,Than has so outraged us.  Let Odoric find
24128,XXXIX,Pardon his offences; I the pain
24129,XXXIX,"Of these should justly suffer, who was blind;"
24130,XXXIX,"Blind when I gave him such a trust, nor saw"
24131,XXXIX,"How easily the fire consumes the straw."""
24132,XXXIX,
24133,XL,XL
24134,XL,"""Then gazing upon Odoric, 'gan say:"
24135,XL,"""This is the penance I enjoin to thee;"
24136,XL,"That thou a year shalt with the beldam stay,"
24137,XL,Nor ever leave this while her company;
24138,XL,"But, roving or at rest, by night or day,"
24139,XL,Shalt never for an hour without her be;
24140,XL,And her shall even unto death maintain
24141,XL,Against whoever threatens her with pain.
24142,XL,
24143,XLI,XLI
24144,XLI,"""I will, if so this woman shall command,"
24145,XLI,"With whosoe'er he be, thou battle do."
24146,XLI,"I will this while that thou all France's land,"
24147,XLI,"From city shalt to city, wander through."""
24148,XLI,So says he: for as Odoric at his hand
24149,XLI,"Well merits death, for his foul trespass due,"
24150,XLI,"This is a pitfall for his feet to shape,"
24151,XLI,Which it will be rare fortune if he 'scape.
24152,XLI,
24153,XLII,XLII
24154,XLII,"So many women, many men betrayed,"
24155,XLII,"And wronged by her, have been so many more,"
24156,XLII,"Not without strife by knight shall he be stayed,"
24157,XLII,Who was beneath his care the beldam hoar.
24158,XLII,"So, for their crimes, shall both alike be paid;"
24159,XLII,"She for her evil actions done before,"
24160,XLII,And he who wrongfully shall her defraud;
24161,XLII,Nor far can go before he finds an end.
24162,XLII,
24163,XLIII,XLIII
24164,XLIII,To keep the pact Zerbino makes him swear
24165,XLIII,"A mighty oath, under this penalty,"
24166,XLIII,"That should he break his faith, and anywhere"
24167,XLIII,"Into his presence led by fortune be,"
24168,XLIII,"Without more mercy, without time for prayer,"
24169,XLIII,"A cruel death shall wait him, as his fee."
24170,XLIII,Next by his comrades (so their lord commands)
24171,XLIII,Sir Odoric is unpinioned from his bands.
24172,XLIII,
24173,XLIV,XLIV
24174,XLIV,"Corebo frees the traitor in the end,"
24175,XLIV,"Almonio yielding, yet as ill content:"
24176,XLIV,"For much Zerbino's mercies both offend,"
24177,XLIV,Which thus their so desired revenge prevent.
24178,XLIV,"Thence, he disloyal to his prince and friend,"
24179,XLIV,In company with that curst woman went.
24180,XLIV,"What these befel Sir Turpin has not said,"
24181,XLIV,But more I once in other author read.
24182,XLIV,
24183,XLV,XLV
24184,XLV,This author vouches (I declare not who)
24185,XLV,"That hence they had not one day's journey wended,"
24186,XLV,"When Odoric, to all pact, all faith, untrue,"
24187,XLV,"For riddance of the pest to him commended,"
24188,XLV,"About Gabrina's neck a halter threw,"
24189,XLV,And left her to a neighbouring elm suspended;
24190,XLV,And in a year (the place he does not name)
24191,XLV,Almonio by the traitor did the same.
24192,XLV,
24193,XLVI,XLVI
24194,XLVI,"Zerbino, who the Paladin pursues,"
24195,XLVI,"And loath would be to lose the cavalier,"
24196,XLVI,"To his Scottish squadron of himself sends news,"
24197,XLVI,Which for its captain well might stand in fear;
24198,XLVI,"Almonio sends, and many matters shews,"
24199,XLVI,Too long at full to be recited here;
24200,XLVI,"Almonio sends, Corebo next; nor stayed"
24201,XLVI,"Other with him, besides the royal maid."
24202,XLVI,
24203,XLVII,XLVII
24204,XLVII,"So mighty is the love Zerbino bore,"
24205,XLVII,Nor less than his the love which Isabel
24206,XLVII,"Nursed for the valorous Paladin, so sore"
24207,XLVII,He longed to know if that bold infidel
24208,XLVII,"The Count had found, who in the duel tore"
24209,XLVII,"Him from his horse, together with the sell,"
24210,XLVII,"That he to Charles's camp, till the third day"
24211,XLVII,"Be ended, will not measure back his way."
24212,XLVII,
24213,XLVIII,XLVIII
24214,XLVIII,This was the term for which Orlando said
24215,XLVIII,"He should wait him, who yet no faulchion wears;"
24216,XLVIII,"Nor is there place the Count has visited,"
24217,XLVIII,But thither in his search Zerbino fares.
24218,XLVIII,"Last to those trees, upon whose bark was read"
24219,XLVIII,"The ungrateful lady's writing, he repairs,"
24220,XLVIII,Little beside the road; and there finds all
24221,XLVIII,"In strange disorder, rock and water-fall."
24222,XLVIII,
24223,XLIX,XLIX
24224,XLIX,"Far off, he saw that something shining lay,"
24225,XLIX,And spied Orlando's corslet on the ground;
24226,XLIX,And next his helm; but not that head-piece gay
24227,XLIX,Which whilom African Almontes crowned:
24228,XLIX,"He in the thicket heard a courser neigh,"
24229,XLIX,"And, lifting up his visage at the sound,"
24230,XLIX,"Saw Brigliadoro the green herbage browze,"
24231,XLIX,With rein yet hanging at his saddle-bows.
24232,XLIX,
24233,L,L
24234,L,"For Durindane, he sought the greenwood, round,"
24235,L,Which separate from the scabbard met his view;
24236,L,"And next the surcoat, but in tatters, found;"
24237,L,"That, in a hundred rags, the champaign strew."
24238,L,"Zerbino and Isabel, in grief profound,"
24239,L,"Stood looking on, nor what to think they knew:"
24240,L,"They of all matters else might think, besides"
24241,L,The fury which the wretched Count misguides.
24242,L,
24243,LI,LI
24244,LI,"Had but the lovers seen a drop of blood,"
24245,LI,They might have well believed Orlando dead:
24246,LI,"This while the pair, beside the neighbouring flood,"
24247,LI,"Beheld a shepherd coming, pale with dread."
24248,LI,"He just before, as on a rock he stood,"
24249,LI,Had seen the wretch's fury; how he shed
24250,LI,"His arms about the forest, tore his clothes,"
24251,LI,"Slew hinds, and caused a thousand other woes."
24252,LI,
24253,LII,LII
24254,LII,"Questioned by good Zerbino, him the swain"
24255,LII,"Of all which there had chanced, informed aright."
24256,LII,"Zerbino marvelled, and believed with pain,"
24257,LII,"Although the proofs were clear:  This as it might,"
24258,LII,"He from his horse dismounted on the plain,"
24259,LII,"Full of compassion, in afflicted plight;"
24260,LII,"And went about, collecting from the ground"
24261,LII,The various relics which were scattered round.
24262,LII,
24263,LIII,LIII
24264,LIII,"Isabel lights as well; and, where they lie"
24265,LIII,"Dispersed, the various arms uniting goes."
24266,LIII,"Lo!  them a damsel joins, who frequent sigh"
24267,LIII,"Heaves from her heart, and doleful visage shows."
24268,LIII,"If any ask me who the dame, and why"
24269,LIII,"She mourns, and with such sorrow overflows;"
24270,LIII,"I say 'twas Flordelice, who, bound in trace"
24271,LIII,"Of her lost lover's footsteps, sought that place."
24272,LIII,
24273,LIV,LIV
24274,LIV,Her Brandimart had left disconsolate
24275,LIV,"Without farewell, i' the court of Charlemagne:"
24276,LIV,Who there expected him six months or eight; --
24277,LIV,"And lastly, since he came not there again,"
24278,LIV,"From sea to sea, had sought her absent mate,"
24279,LIV,Through Alpine and through Pyrenean chain:
24280,LIV,"In every place had sought the warrior, save"
24281,LIV,Within the palace of Atlantes' grave.
24282,LIV,
24283,LV,LV
24284,LV,"If she had been in that enchanted hold,"
24285,LV,She might before have seen the cavalier
24286,LV,"Wandering with Bradamant, Rogero bold,"
24287,LV,Gradasso and Ferrau and Brava's peer.
24288,LV,"But, when Astolpho chased the wizard old,"
24289,LV,"With the loud bugle, horrible to hear,"
24290,LV,To Paris he returned; but nought of this
24291,LV,As yet was known to faithful Flordelice.
24292,LV,
24293,LVI,LVI
24294,LVI,To Flordelice were known the arms and sword
24295,LVI,"(Who, as I say, by chance so joined the twain),"
24296,LVI,"And Brigliadoro, left without his lord,"
24297,LVI,Yet bearing at the saddle-bow his rein:
24298,LVI,"She with her eyes the unhappy signs explored,"
24299,LVI,"And she had heard the tidings of the swain,"
24300,LVI,"Who had alike related, how he viewed"
24301,LVI,"Orlando running frantic, in his mood."
24302,LVI,
24303,LVII,LVII
24304,LVII,"Here prince Zerbino all the arms unites,"
24305,LVII,"And hangs, like a fair trophy, on a pine."
24306,LVII,"And, to preserve them safe from errant knights,"
24307,LVII,"Natives or foreigners, in one short line"
24308,LVII,"Upon the sapling's verdant surface writes,"
24309,"ORLANDO'S ARMS, KING CHARLES'S PALADINE.","ORLANDO'S ARMS, KING CHARLES'S PALADINE."

24316,LVIII,The Tartar king arrives upon the mead.
24317,LVIII,"He, at the trophied pine-tree's gorgeous show,"
24318,LVIII,Beseeches him the cause of this to read;
24319,LVIII,Who lets him (as rehearsed) the story know.
24320,LVIII,"When, without further pause, the paynim lord"

24338,LX,Without more parley spurred upon each side.

24346,LXI,"He leaps about his courser like a doe,"
24347,LXI,Where'er the road best footing does afford.
24348,LXI,And well it is that he should not forego
24349,LXI,"An inch of vantage; who, if once that sword"
24350,LXI,"Smite him, will join the enamoured ghosts, which rove"
24351,LXI,Amid the mazes of the myrtle grove.
24352,LXI,
24353,LXII,LXII
24354,LXII,"As the swift-footed dog, who does espy"
24355,LXII,"Swine severed from his fellows, hunts him hard,"

24358,LXII,"So, while the sword descends, or hangs on high,"
24359,LXII,"Zerbino stands, attentive how to ward,"
24360,LXII,How to save life and honour from surprise;
24361,LXII,"And keeps a wary eye, and smites and flies."

24364,LXIII,"On the other side, where'er the foe is seen"

24367,LXIII,That in the month of March shakes leafy wood;
24368,LXIII,Which to the ground now bends the forest green.
24369,LXIII,"Now whirls the broken boughs, at random strewed."
24370,LXIII,"Although the prince wards many, in the end"

24372,LXIII,
24373,LXIV,LXIV
24374,LXIV,"In the end he cannot scape one downright blow,"
24375,LXIV,"Which enters, between sword and shield, his breast,"
24376,LXIV,"As perfect was the plate and corslet, so"
24377,LXIV,Thick was the steel wherein his paunch was drest:
24378,LXIV,"But the destructive weapon, falling low,"
24379,LXIV,Equally opened either iron vest;
24380,LXIV,"And cleft whate'er it swept in its descent,"

24382,LXIV,
24383,LXV,LXV
24384,LXV,"And, but that somewhat short the blow descends,"
24385,LXV,It would Zerbino like a cane divide;
24386,LXV,"But him so little in the quick offends,"
24387,LXV,This scarce beyond the skin is scarified.
24388,LXV,More than a span in length the wound extends;
24389,LXV,Of little depth: of blood a tepid tide
24390,LXV,"To his feet descending, with a crimson line,"
24391,LXV,Stains the bright arms which on the warrior shine.
24392,LXV,
24393,LXVI,LXVI

24398,LXVI,Here little vantage young Zerbino drew
24399,LXVI,"From strength and greater daring, and from art;"
24400,LXVI,"For in the temper of his arms and might,"
24401,LXVI,Too much the Tartar king excelled the knight.
24402,LXVI,
24403,LXVII,LXVII
24404,LXVII,"The fearful stroke was mightier in show,"

24408,LXVII,"The Scottish prince, all over in a glow,"
24409,LXVII,"With anger and resentment was possest,"
24410,LXVII,"And putting all his strength in either hand,"

24427,LXIX,"The trenchant sword, which smote the shield outright,"
24428,LXIX,And cleft from top to bottom equally;
24429,LXIX,"Shearing the sleeve beneath it, and the knight"

24477,LXXIV,Already had to Paris made repair.
24478,LXXIV,"So far the damsel pricked by hill and plain,"

24497,LXXVI,"But knows not what to do, not what to say."
24498,LXXVI,For lack of comfort she beholds him die;
24499,LXXVI,"Since every city is too far away,"
24500,LXXVI,"Where in this need she could resort to leech,"
24501,LXXVI,Whose succour she might purchase or beseech.

24991,IX,So much the youth resembles her in cheer:
24992,IX,More sure the more intently he espies
24993,IX,Her face and shape: when thus the cavalier:

25013,XI,"Smote some across the gullet, cheek, or crown."
25014,XI,"Screaming, the dissipated rabble fled;"
25015,XI,The most with cloven limbs or broken head.
25016,XI,
25017,XII,XII
25018,XII,"As while at feed, in full security,"

25027,XIII,XIII

25031,XIII,And countless to the eyes and teeth below.
25032,XIII,"I grant no helmets on their heads they wore,"
25033,XIII,But there were shining iron caps enow;
25034,XIII,"And, if fine helmets did their temples press,"
25035,XIII,"His sword would cut as deep, or little less."
25036,XIII,
25037,XIV,XIV
25038,XIV,"Such good Rogero's force and valour are,"
25039,XIV,As never now-a-days in warrior dwell;
25040,XIV,"Nor yet in rampant lion, nor in bear,"
25041,XIV,Nor (whether home or foreign) beast more fell.
25042,XIV,"Haply with him the earthquake might compare,"
25043,XIV,Or haply the great devil -- not he of hell --
25044,XIV,"But he who is my lord's, who moves in fire,"
25045,XIV,"And parts heaven, earth, and ocean in his ire."
25046,XIV,
25047,XV,XV
25048,XV,At every stroke he never less o'erthrew
25049,XV,"Than one, and oftener two, upon the plain;"
25050,XV,"And four, at once, and even five he slew;"
25051,XV,So that a hundred in a thought were slain.
25052,XV,The sword Rogero from his girdle drew
25053,XV,"As knife cuts curd, divides their plate and chain."
25054,XV,"Falerina in Orgagna's garden made,"
25055,XV,"To deal Orlando death, that cruel blade."
25056,XV,
25057,XVI,XVI
25058,XVI,"But to have forged that falchion sorely rued,"
25059,XVI,Who saw her garden wasted by the brand.
25060,XVI,"What wreck, what ruin then must have ensued,"
25061,XVI,From this when wielded by such warrior's hand?
25062,XVI,"If e'er Rogero force, e'er fury shewed,"
25063,XVI,"If e'er his mighty valour well was scanned,"
25064,XVI,'Twas here; 'twas here employed; 'twas here displayed;
25065,XVI,In the desire to give his lady aid.
25066,XVI,
25067,XVII,XVII
25068,XVII,"As hare from hound unslipt, that helpless train"
25069,XVII,Defends itself against the cavalier.
25070,XVII,"Many lay dead upon the cumbered plain,"
25071,XVII,And numberless were they who fled in fear.
25072,XVII,Meanwhile the damsel had unloosed the chain
25073,XVII,"From the youth's hands, and him in martial gear"
25074,XVII,"Was hastening, with what speed she might, to deck,"
25075,XVII,With sword in hand and shield about his neck.
25076,XVII,
25077,XVIII,XVIII
25078,XVIII,"He, who was angered sore, as best he cou'd,"
25079,XVIII,Sought to avenge him of that evil crew;
25080,XVIII,"And gave such signal proofs of hardihood,"
25081,XVIII,As stamped him for a warrior good and true.
25082,XVIII,The sun already in the western flood
25083,XVIII,"Had dipt his gilded wheels, what time the two,"

25101,XX,I of her well-known accents do not hear:

26445,LXI,"At this Rogero, leaping on his feet,"
26446,LXI,"Who scarcely had endured the whole to hear,"
26447,LXI,"To Richardetto turned; and, as a meet"
26448,LXI,"Guerdon for his good deed, the cavalier"
26449,LXI,"Did, with beseechings infinite, entreat"
26450,LXI,"To let him singly with that damsel steer,"
26451,LXI,"Until she showed the paynim, who by force"
26452,LXI,Had wrested from her hands that goodly horse.

26455,LXII,Richardet (though it seems discourtesy
26456,LXII,"To yield to other champion that emprize,"
26457,LXII,Which by himself should terminated be)
26458,LXII,Yet with Rogero's earnest suit complies;
26459,LXII,"Who takes farewell of that good company,"
26460,LXII,And with the damsel on her journey hies.
26461,LXII,"And leaves those others, whom his feats confound,"

26465,LXIII,"To him Hippalca said, when she apart"

26468,LXIII,Bore of his worth the image so imprest;
26469,LXIII,"-- And added, without using farther art,"
26470,LXIII,All that her lady had to him addrest;
26471,LXIII,"And if she told another tale whilere,"
26472,LXIII,Of Richardetto she was then in fear.
26473,LXIII,
26474,LXIV,LXIV
26475,LXIV,She added how the author of that deed

26477,LXIV,"""Because I know Rogero owns the steed,"
26478,LXIV,More willingly I take him from his guide.
26479,LXIV,"If he would repossess the courser, read"
26480,LXIV,"To him what I have no desire to hide,"

26487,LXV,As well as that the horse was his delight;
26488,LXV,As well upon account of whence it came;
26489,LXV,And also that 'twas reft in his despite;
26490,LXV,"He sees dishonour will ensue and blame,"
26491,LXV,"Save he from Rodomont redeems the prey,"
26492,LXV,And with a due revenge that wrong repay.

26495,LXVI,"With him, without repose, the damsel rides,"
26496,LXVI,Who with his foe would bring him front to front;
26497,LXVI,"And thither journies where the road divides,"
26498,LXVI,"And one branch cuts the plain, one climbs the mount,"
26499,LXVI,"And either pathway to that valley guides,"
26500,LXVI,"Where she had newly left King Rodomont,"
26501,LXVI,"The mountain track was short, but trod with pain;"

26504,LXVII,LXVII
26505,LXVII,"Hippalca's ardour to retrieve the prey,"
26506,LXVII,"And upon Rodomont's avenge the wrong,"
26507,LXVII,Incites that maid the mountain to assay;
26508,LXVII,By which (as said) the journey was less long:
26509,LXVII,"While Mandricardo, Rodomont, and they"
26510,LXVII,"Of whom I erst made mention in my song,"
26511,LXVII,That easier track across the level hold;

26519,LXVIII,Now hear the upshot of this history!
26520,LXVIII,"Their way directly by that fountain lies,"
26521,LXVIII,Beside whose margin are in pastime met
26522,LXVIII,Marphisa and Aldigier and Richardet.
26523,LXVIII,
26524,LXIX,LXIX
26525,LXIX,"Marphisa had, at her companions' prayer,"
26526,LXIX,"Cloathed her in female ornaments and vest,"
26527,LXIX,"Of those, which by Maganza's traitour were"
26528,LXIX,"Late to Lanfusa, in full trust, addrest;"
26529,LXIX,"And, though the appearance of that maid was rare"
26530,LXIX,"Without her corslet, casque and all the rest,"
26531,LXIX,"-- At their entreaty, these for once laid down --"
26532,LXIX,She deigned to seem a maid and donned the gown.
26533,LXIX,
26534,LXX,LXX
26535,LXX,"As soon as Mandricardo saw her face,"
26536,LXX,"In trust that, could he win her in affray,"
26537,LXX,"He would that maid, in recompense and place"
26538,LXX,"Of Doralice, to Rodomont convey;"
26539,LXX,"As if Love trafficked in such contracts base,"
26540,LXX,"And lover could his lady change away,"
26541,LXX,"Nor yet with reason at the event be pained,"
26542,LXX,If he in losing one another gained.
26543,LXX,
26544,LXXI,LXXI
26545,LXXI,"Hence with a damsel to provide the peer,"
26546,LXXI,That he himself the other may retain;
26547,LXXI,"Deeming her worthy any cavalier,"
26548,LXXI,He would by force of arms the maid obtain;
26549,LXXI,"And, as if he could suddenly hold dear"
26550,LXXI,"This maid as that, on him bestow the gain;"
26551,LXXI,"And all of those, whom he about her spied,"
26552,LXXI,Forthwith to joust and single fight defied.
26553,LXXI,
26554,LXXII,LXXII
26555,LXXII,Vivian and Malagigi (who were dight
26556,LXXII,"In arms, as guard and surety for the rest,)"
26557,LXXII,"One and the other champion -- prompt for fight,"
26558,LXXII,"Rose lightly from the herbage which they prest,"
26559,LXXII,Deeming they had to joust with either knight;
26560,LXXII,"But Rodomont, who came not on this quest,"
26561,LXXII,No motion made as he a course would run;
26562,LXXII,So that they had to tourney but with one.
26563,LXXII,
26564,LXXIII,LXXIII
26565,LXXIII,"Sir Vivian is the first who moves his horse,"
26566,LXXIII,"With mighty heart, and lays his weapon low;"
26567,LXXIII,"And he, that Tartar king, renowned for force,"
26568,LXXIII,With greater puissance meets the coming foe.
26569,LXXIII,His lance each warrior levels in the course
26570,LXXIII,Where he bests trusts to plant the furious blow.
26571,LXXIII,Vainly Sir Vivian's spear the casque offends;
26572,LXXIII,"Nor throws that paynim knight, nor even bends."
26573,LXXIII,
26574,LXXIV,LXXIV
26575,LXXIV,That Tartar's harder weapon makes the shield
26576,LXXIV,"Of Vivian, at their onset, fly like grass;"
26577,LXXIV,"And, tumbling from his saddle on the field,"
26578,LXXIV,Extends the champion amid flowers and grass.
26579,LXXIV,"To run his chance Sir Malagigi, steeled,"
26580,LXXIV,Did to his brother's succour quickly pass;
26581,LXXIV,But (such that warrior's hurry to be near)
26582,LXXIV,"Rather accompanied, than venged the peer."
26583,LXXIV,
26584,LXXV,LXXV
26585,LXXV,The other of those brethren armed before
26586,LXXV,"His cousin, and had backed his courser wight;"
26587,LXXV,"And, having first defied, encountered sore,"
26588,LXXV,"Spurring with flowing rein, the stranger knight."
26589,LXXV,Against the tempered helm that pagan wore
26590,LXXV,"Sounded the blow, an inch below the sight:"
26591,LXXV,"Heaven-high the truncheon flew, in fragments broke,"
26592,LXXV,But the stout pagan winced not for the stroke.
26593,LXXV,
26594,LXXVI,LXXVI
26595,LXXVI,"Him on the left side smote that paynim peer,"
26596,LXXVI,And (for the blow was with huge force designed)
26597,LXXVI,"Little his shield, and less his iron gear,"
26598,LXXVI,"Availed, which opened like the yielding rhind:"
26599,LXXVI,The weapon pierced his shoulder; Aldigier
26600,LXXVI,Now right now left upon his horse inclined;
26601,LXXVI,"Then him, 'mid grass and flowers, his comrades view,"
26602,LXXVI,"With arms of crimson, face of pallid, hue."
26603,LXXVI,
26604,LXXVII,LXXVII
26605,LXXVII,"Next Richardetto comes, and for the blow"
26606,LXXVII,"Intended, levels such a mighty lance,"
26607,LXXVII,"He showed himself, as he was wont to show,"
26608,LXXVII,Worthy to be a paladin of France;
26609,LXXVII,And has stamped signs of this upon the foe.
26610,LXXVII,If he had warred on him with equal chance;
26611,LXXVII,"But prostrate rolled, encumbered by his steed;"
26612,LXXVII,Nor fell the courser through his lord's misdeed.
26613,LXXVII,
26614,LXXVIII,LXXVIII
26615,LXXVIII,"When knight appeared not on the other side,"
26616,LXXVIII,"Who should in joust the paynim king affront,"
26617,LXXVIII,"He thought the damsel was his prize, and hied"
26618,LXXVIII,"Thither, where she was seated by the fount."
26619,LXXVIII,"And -- ""Lady, you are mine,"" the Tartar cried,"
26620,LXXVIII,"""Save other champion in your succour mount;"
26621,LXXVIII,"Nor can you make denial or excuse,"
26622,LXXVIII,"Since such the right of war and common use."""

26628,LXXIX,"Concluding I am thine by right of war,"
26629,LXXIX,If either were my lord or cavalier
26630,LXXIX,"Of those, by thee unhorsed in bloody jar:"

26644,LXXXI,LXXXI
26645,LXXXI,"The damsel donned her sword, when armed all o'er,"
26646,LXXXI,And on her courser leapt with nimble spring;
26647,LXXXI,"And, right and left, she made him, thrice or more"
26648,LXXXI,"Poised on his haunches, turn in narrow ring."
26649,LXXXI,"And, levelling the sturdy lance she bore,"
26650,LXXXI,"Defied, and next assailed, the Tartar king."
26651,LXXXI,"So combating with Peleus' son, of yore,"
26652,LXXXI,Penthesilaea warred on Trojan shore.

26655,LXXXII,"Like brittle crystal, in that proud career,"
26656,LXXXII,The weapons at the rest to pieces went;
26657,LXXXII,"Yet neither of those warriors, 'twould appear,"
26658,LXXXII,Backwards one inch at their encounter bent.
26659,LXXXII,"Marphisa, who would willingly be clear"
26660,LXXXII,"What of a closer fight would be the event,"
26661,LXXXII,"For a new combat with the paynim lord,"

26665,LXXXIII,"That Tartar cursed the elements and sky,"
26666,LXXXIII,When her he saw remaining in her sell;
26667,LXXXIII,"And she, who thought to make his buckler fly,"
26668,LXXXIII,Cursed heaven as loudly as that infidel.
26669,LXXXIII,"Already were their faulchions raised on high,"
26670,LXXXIII,Which on the enchanted arms like hammers fell:
26671,LXXXIII,"Enchanted arms both combatants enclose,"
26672,LXXXIII,Never more needed by those deadly foes.

26674,LXXXIV,LXXXIV
26675,LXXXIV,"So perfect are the champions' plate and chain,"

26678,LXXXIV,Throughout this and throughout another day:
26679,LXXXIV,"But Rodomont leaps in between the twain,"
26680,LXXXIV,And taxes Mandricardo with delay;
26681,LXXXIV,"Crying, ""If battle here is to be done,"
26682,LXXXIV,Finish we that which we to-day begun.

26693,LXXXV,
26694,LXXXVI,LXXXVI
26695,LXXXVI,Next prays not only with that Tartar knight
26696,LXXXVI,She will abandon or defer the fray;
26697,LXXXVI,"But that, Troyano's valiant son to right,"
26698,LXXXVI,"She will, together with them, wend her way;"
26699,LXXXVI,"By which her warlike fame a higher flight,"
26700,LXXXVI,"More easily may, even to heaven, assay,"

26708,LXXXVII,"From clime so distant, with no other view,"
26709,LXXXVII,Than by her own experience to be taught
26710,LXXXVII,"If their far-spread renown were false or true,"
26711,LXXXVII,"Resolved together with the troop to speed,"

26719,LXXXVIII,"And thinking, that he was not far away,"
26720,LXXXVIII,"And the road straight towards that fountain led,"
26721,LXXXVIII,"Trotting in haste behind the Sarzan hied,"

26725,LXXXIX,"Hippalca he to Mont Albano prayed,"

26730,LXXXIX,But that he would retrieve the ravished prize.
26731,LXXXIX,"And, were she in Mount Alban -- or where'er --"
26732,LXXXIX,"Vowed she the tidings speedily should hear,"
26733,LXXXIX,

26738,XC,She would excuse him by her friendly lore.
26739,XC,"Hippalca in her memory fixt, with care,"

26759,XCII,"Job was outdone by Rodomont that day,"
26760,XCII,"In that the king subdued his haughty pride,"

26765,XCII,"The first day this and last, that e'er in fight"

26768,XCII,In succour of his sovereign to repair;
26769,XCII,That if he had believed he clutched the knight
26770,XCII,"Faster than nimble leopard gripes the hare,"
26771,XCII,"He not so far his purpose would forego,"

26837,C,"How in the castle perilous of yore,"
26838,C,"He gained that noble ensign for his meed,"
26839,C,"-- That enterprize I ween, with matter more,"
26840,C,"You bear in mind, and how, for his good deed,"
26841,C,"The fairy gave it him with all the gear,"
26842,C,Erst given by Vulcan to the Trojan peer.

26849,CI,Nor had till now those knights encountered more:
26850,CI,When Mandricardo sees that bird imprest
26851,CI,"On the Child's shield, he shouts with threatening cry"
26852,CI,"To young Rogero: ""Take my proud defy!"""

26857,CII,"And think'st thou, madman, I will thee forbear,"
26858,CII,Because for once to spare thee I was led?
26859,CII,But since nor menace nor yet counsel are
26860,CII,"Of force to drive this folly from thy head,"
26861,CII,It shall appear how much it had been best
26862,CII,"For thee forthwith to have obeyed my hest."""

26868,CIII,By the first word with which that king offends.
26869,CIII,"""Thou thinkest,"" he exclaims, ""to bear me down,"
26870,CIII,Because his knight as well with me contends:
26871,CIII,But learn that I can win in fighting field

26887,CV,"Which lately, underneath the greenwood tree,"
26888,CV,Orlando from his hand in fury threw.
26889,CV,"The Child, who could not aught but courteous be,"
26890,CV,(Such was his gentle nature) at the view

26894,CVI,CVI
26895,CVI,"And at the same time, strained his goodly sword;"
26896,CVI,And better braced the covering shield he wore:
26897,CVI,"But 'twixt those combatants leapt Argier's lord,"
26898,CVI,And quick Marphisa spurred the pair before;
26899,CVI,"And one this foe, the other that implored,"
26900,CVI,"And both besought, that they would strive no more."
26901,CVI,King Rodomont complains the Tartar knight
26902,CVI,Has violated twice the compact plight.
26903,CVI,
26904,CVII,CVII
26905,CVII,"First, in belief he should Marphisa gain,"
26906,CVII,He more than once had jousted for that fair;
26907,CVII,"Now to bear off Rogero's ensign fain,"
26908,CVII,He for king Agramant shows little care.

26919,CVIII,"You then with him, if you survive, your right"

26928,CIX,And trust to make thee sweat from feet to front.
26929,CIX,"And to bestow on others, much shall save,"

26936,CX,Now upon this and now upon that side.
26937,CX,"With Rodomont and with the Child at feud,"
26938,CX,Fierce Mandricardo both at once defied.
26939,CX,"Rogero, not endowed with suffering mood,"
26940,CX,"Would hear no more of peace, but vengeance cried."
26941,CX,"Now here Marphisa hurried, and now there,"
26942,CX,But could not singly such an ill repair.
26943,CX,
26944,CXI,CXI
26945,CXI,"As peasant, when a river saps its mounds,"
26946,CXI,"And seeking vent the oozing waters drop,"
26947,CXI,"Hastening to shut the stream within its bounds,"
26948,CXI,"And save his pastures and expected crop,"
26949,CXI,Dams right and left; yet him the stream confounds:
26950,CXI,"For, if he here the sinking ruin prop,"
26951,CXI,"There he beholds the rotten dyke give out,"
26952,CXI,"And from thick seams the restless water spout,"
26953,CXI,

26955,CXII,"So, while the Tartar and Rogero rage,"
26956,CXII,"And Rodomont, in hurly-burly fray,"
26957,CXII,"For each of these would fiercest battle wage,"
26958,CXII,"And would outgo his fears in that assay,"
26959,CXII,"Marphisa seeks their fury to assuage,"
26960,CXII,"And strives, and time and trouble throws away;"
26961,CXII,"For as she makes one knight from strife retire,"
26962,CXII,She sees the others re-engage with ire.
26963,CXII,
26964,CXIII,CXIII
26965,CXIII,"Marphisa, to appease the warriors bent,"

26968,CXIII,To leave until we Agramant restore.
26969,CXIII,"If each is on his own design intent,"
26970,CXIII,With Mandricardo will I strive once more;
26971,CXIII,"And fain would see, according to his word,"
26972,CXIII,If he can conquer me with spear and sword.

26978,CXIV,"Rogero said, ""so he restore my steed."
26979,CXIV,"Let him resign that horse, or -- once for all."
26980,CXIV,I say again -- to his defence take heed.
26981,CXIV,"I either here my parting breath will yield,"
26982,CXIV,"Or on my courser will return afield."""

26986,CXV,"As 'twere that other,"" Rodomont replied;"
26987,CXV,"And thus pursued: ""I unto thee protest,"
26988,CXV,"If any evil shall our king betide,"
26989,CXV,Thine is the fault not mine; for I am prest
26990,CXV,"To do whate'er is fitting, on my side."""
26991,CXV,"Small heed to that protest Rogero paid,"
26992,CXV,"And stung by fury, griped his trenchant blade."
26993,CXV,
26994,CXVI,CXVI
26995,CXVI,"On Argier's king he sprang, like savage boar,"
26996,CXVI,Encountering him with shoulder and with shield;
26997,CXVI,"And him disordered and distrest so sore,"
26998,CXVI,"That with one stirrup's loss, the monarch reeled."
26999,CXVI,"-- ""Rogero,"" Mandricardo cried, ""give o'er,"
27000,CXVI,"Or else with me divide the battle-field"";"
27001,CXVI,"And struck, this said, with worse than felon spite,"
27002,CXVI,Upon the morion of that youthful knight.
27003,CXVI,
27004,CXVII,CXVII
27005,CXVII,Even to his courser's neck Rogero bends;
27006,CXVII,"Nor, when he would, himself can rear;"
27007,CXVII,Because the sword of Ulien's son descends
27008,CXVII,As well upon the youthful cavalier;
27009,CXVII,"And, but that adamant his face defends,"
27010,CXVII,Across the cheeks his tempered helm would sheer.
27011,CXVII,"The Child, in anguish, opens either hand;"
27012,CXVII,And this the bridle drops and that the brand.
27013,CXVII,
27014,CXVIII,CXVIII
27015,CXVIII,Him o'er the field his courser bears away;
27016,CXVIII,"On earth the faulchion lies, which he let go:"
27017,CXVIII,"Marphisa (with Rogero's through that day,"
27018,CXVIII,"Comrade in arms) appeared like fire to glow,"
27019,CXVIII,"Enraged, that two one knight should overlay;"
27020,CXVIII,"And, as magnanimous and stout, for foe"
27021,CXVIII,"Singled King Mandricardo out, and sped,"
27022,CXVIII,"With all her might, stroke upon his head."
27023,CXVIII,
27024,CXIX,CXIX
27025,CXIX,Rodomont o'er the plain pursues his man.
27026,CXIX,"-- Another stroke, and he has lost the horse!"
27027,CXIX,"But Richardetto drives, and Vivian,"
27028,CXIX,Between the Child and paynim in that course.
27029,CXIX,"This warrior at the king of Argier ran,"
27030,CXIX,And from Rogero severed him by force;
27031,CXIX,"That (it was Vivian) in Rogero's hand,"
27032,CXIX,"Now from the blow recovered, placed his brand."
27033,CXIX,
27034,CXX,CXX
27035,CXX,"As soon as to himself the Child returns,"
27036,CXX,"And is by Vivian armed with sword again,"
27037,CXX,"To venge the injury that stripling burns,"
27038,CXX,"And runs at Rodomont with flowing rein,"
27039,CXX,"Like lion, whom a bull upon his horns"
27040,CXX,"Has lifted, though he feels this while no pain,"
27041,CXX,"So him his heat of blood, disdain, and ire,"
27042,CXX,To venge that cruel outrage goad and fire.
27043,CXX,
27044,CXXI,CXXI
27045,CXXI,Rogero storms upon the paynim's crest;
27046,CXXI,"And, could that knight recover his own brand,"
27047,CXXI,Which by foul felony (as erst exprest)
27048,CXXI,"Was ravished from the youthful warrior's hand,"
27049,CXXI,I well believe that the descending pest
27050,CXXI,Rodomont's iron casque will ill withstand;
27051,CXXI,"That casque which Babel's king bade forge, who sought"
27052,CXXI,To war on Heaven in his presumptuous thought.
27053,CXXI,
27054,CXXII,CXXII
27055,CXXII,"Discord, believing nothing could ensue"
27056,CXXII,"But stir, and strife, and combat on that head;"
27057,CXXII,"And that there was no place, amid the crew,"
27058,CXXII,"For truce or treaty, to her sister said,"
27059,CXXII,"That she, her well-beloved monks to view,"
27060,CXXII,Might now again with her securely tread.
27061,CXXII,Let them depart; and mark we where in front
27062,CXXII,Rogero has sore wounded Rodomont.
27063,CXXII,
27064,CXXIII,CXXIII
27065,CXXIII,"Rogero's blow was levelled with such spite,"
27066,CXXIII,That this upon Frontino's crupper made
27067,CXXIII,"The helmet and the shell of iron smite,"
27068,CXXIII,In which that Saracen his limbs arrayed;
27069,CXXIII,"And he, three times or four, to left and right,"
27070,CXXIII,"-- As if about to fall -- head-foremost, swayed;"
27071,CXXIII,"And would have lost withal his trusty brand,"
27072,CXXIII,But that the hilt was fastened to his hand.
27073,CXXIII,
27074,CXXIV,CXXIV
27075,CXXIV,Marphisa has king Mandricardo prest
27076,CXXIV,"Meanwhile, and makes him sweat breast, front, and face;"
27077,CXXIV,And he Marphisa has as sore distrest:
27078,CXXIV,"But such good plates each valiant bosom case,"
27079,CXXIV,Impassable is either iron vest;
27080,CXXIV,And both have hitherto maintained their place.
27081,CXXIV,"But, at a turn her martial courser made,"
27082,CXXIV,Marphisa needed young Rogero's aid.
27083,CXXIV,
27084,CXXV,CXXV
27085,CXXV,"Marphisa's martial steed, in turning short,"
27086,CXXV,"Where a firm footing that soft mead denied,"
27087,CXXV,"On the moist surface slipt, and in such sort,"
27088,CXXV,"That he fell, helpless, on his better side;"
27089,CXXV,"And, as he rose in haste and lacked support,"
27090,CXXV,Athwart by furious Brigliador was plied;
27091,CXXV,"On which the paynim, little courteous, came;"
27092,CXXV,So that he fell anew beneath the dame.
27093,CXXV,
27094,CXXVI,CXXVI
27095,CXXVI,"Rogero, when Marphisa on the ground"
27096,CXXVI,"He saw unhorsed, deferred no more his aid;"
27097,CXXVI,"Who for that deed had leisure; since, astound,"
27098,CXXVI,Rodomont far away had been conveyed:
27099,CXXVI,He smote the morion which that Tartar crowned;
27100,CXXVI,"And, cleft like stalk, his head on earth had laid,"
27101,CXXVI,"Had he his trusty Balisarda born,"
27102,CXXVI,Or Mandricardo other helmet worn.
27103,CXXVI,
27104,CXXVII,CXXVII
27105,CXXVII,"Rodomont, of his senses repossest,"
27106,CXXVII,"Turned round this while, and Richardetto spied;"
27107,CXXVII,"And recollecting how, when late distrest,"
27108,CXXVII,"He to Rogero succour had supplied,"
27109,CXXVII,Quickly against that youthful warrior prest;
27110,CXXVII,"Who an ill guerdon would from him abide,"
27111,CXXVII,Did Malagigi not his malice thwart
27112,CXXVII,With other magic and with mickle art.
27113,CXXVII,
27114,CXXVIII,CXXVIII
27115,CXXVIII,Sage Malagigi versed in every sleight
27116,CXXVIII,Which by the wisest wizard can be done;
27117,CXXVIII,"Although his book he has not, by whose might,"
27118,CXXVIII,He in his course can stop the passing sun;
27119,CXXVIII,"The conjuration recollects and rite,"
27120,CXXVIII,By which he tames the rebel fiends; and one
27121,CXXVIII,"Bids enter into Doralice's steed,"
27122,CXXVIII,Whom he to fury stings and headlong speed.
27123,CXXVIII,
27124,CXXIX,CXXIX
27125,CXXIX,"Into that gentle palfrey's form, who bore"
27126,CXXIX,"The beauteous daughter of King Stordilane,"
27127,CXXIX,"Sir Vivian's brother, simply by his lore,"
27128,CXXIX,Made pass an angel of the dark domain;
27129,CXXIX,"And the good horse, who never moved before,"
27130,CXXIX,"Except in due obedience to the rein,"
27131,CXXIX,"Now took a leap, possest by that ill sprite,"
27132,CXXIX,Thirty feet long and sixteen feet in height.
27133,CXXIX,
27134,CXXX,CXXX
27135,CXXX,"It was a mighty leap, yet not so wide"
27136,CXXX,As to make any rider void the sell.
27137,CXXX,"Seeing herself so high in air, loud cried,"
27138,CXXX,(Yielding herself for dead) that bonnibel.
27139,CXXX,"Her palfrey, with the Daemon for his guide,"
27140,CXXX,"After his leap, runs, goaded by the spell"
27141,CXXX,"(The maid still screaming) such a furious course,"
27142,CXXX,An arrow had not reached the flying horse.
27143,CXXX,
27144,CXXXI,CXXXI
27145,CXXXI,"At the first hearing of that voice, the son"
27146,CXXXI,"Of Ulien, on his part, the strife suspended;"
27147,CXXXI,"And thither, where the furious palfrey run,"
27148,CXXXI,Swiftly in succour of the lady wended.
27149,CXXXI,No less was by the Tartar monarch done;
27150,CXXXI,Who neither Child nor damsel more offended;
27151,CXXXI,"But without craving time, or truce, or peace,"
27152,CXXXI,Pursued King Rodomont and Doralice.
27153,CXXXI,
27154,CXXXII,CXXXII
27155,CXXXII,"Marphisa rose meanwhile, to fury stirred;"
27156,CXXXII,"And, with disdain all over in a glow,"
27157,CXXXII,"Thought to accomplish her revenge, and erred:"
27158,CXXXII,For at too great a distance was the foe.
27159,CXXXII,"Rogero, who beheld the war deferred,"
27160,CXXXII,Rather like lion roared than sighed: well know
27161,CXXXII,"Those two their coursers they should vainly gore,"
27162,CXXXII,Following Frontino and good Brigliador.
27163,CXXXII,
27164,CXXXIII,CXXXIII
27165,CXXXIII,Rogero will not halt till he renew
27166,CXXXIII,And end the unfinished combat for the horse;
27167,CXXXIII,"Marphisa will not quit that Tartar, who"
27168,CXXXIII,Will to her satisfaction prove his force.
27169,CXXXIII,To leave their quarrel in such guise the two
27170,CXXXIII,"Esteem foul scandal; as their better course,"
27171,CXXXIII,"In chase of those offending knights to fare,"
27172,CXXXIII,Is the conclusion of that valiant pair.
27173,CXXXIII,
27174,CXXXIV,CXXXIV
27175,CXXXIV,"They in the paynim camp will find each foe,"
27176,CXXXIV,If them before they find not on their way;
27177,CXXXIV,"Whom thither bound, to raise the siege they know,"
27178,CXXXIV,Ere Charlemagne bring all beneath his sway.
27179,CXXXIV,So thitherward the twain directly go
27180,CXXXIV,"Where these, they deem, will be their certain prey."
27181,CXXXIV,"Yet not so rudely thence Rogero broke,"
27182,CXXXIV,But that he first with his companion spoke.
27183,CXXXIV,
27184,CXXXV,CXXXV
27185,CXXXV,"Thither returns Rogero, where apart"
27186,CXXXV,"Is he, the brother of his lady fair;"
27187,CXXXV,"And vows himself his friend, with generous heart,"
27188,CXXXV,"In good or evil fortune, everywhere."
27189,CXXXV,Him he implores -- and frames his speech with art --
27190,CXXXV,He his salutes will to his sister bear;
27191,CXXXV,"And this so well, he moves by that request"
27192,CXXXV,"No doubt in him, nor any of the rest."
27193,CXXXV,
27194,CXXXVI,CXXXVI
27195,CXXXVI,Of Malagigi he and Viviane
27196,CXXXVI,Next takes farewell and wounded Aldigier;
27197,CXXXVI,Their services no less that kindly twain
27198,CXXXVI,"Proffer, as ever debtors to the peer."
27199,CXXXVI,"Marphisa to seek Paris is so fain,"
27200,CXXXVI,That parting she forgets her friends to cheer;
27201,CXXXVI,"But Malagigi and Vivian, in pursuit,"
27202,CXXXVI,"Follow, and from afar that maid salute;"
27203,CXXXVI,
27204,CXXXVII,CXXXVII
27205,CXXXVII,And so Sir Richardet as well: but low
27206,CXXXVII,"On earth lies Aldigier, and there must rest."
27207,CXXXVII,"The two first champions towards Paris go,"
27208,CXXXVII,And the two others next pursue that quest.

27239,II,"That seemed good counsel, but was ill indeed"
27240,II,"Of Malagigi's, as before was said;"
27241,II,Albeit he so rescued in his need
27242,II,"His cousin Richardet, with odds o'erlaid,"
27243,II,When from the paynim monarchs him he freed
27244,II,"By ready demon, who his hest obeyed;"
27245,II,"For sure he never deemed they should be borne,"
27246,II,Where they would work the Christian army scorn.
27247,II,
27248,III,III
27249,III,"Had he some little prize for counsel stayed,"
27250,III,(We with the same success may well suppose)
27251,III,"He to his cousin might have furnished aid,"
27252,III,Yet brought not on the Christian host their foes:
27253,III,"That evil sprite he might as well have made,"
27254,III,"Him, who embodied in the palfrey goes,"
27255,III,"Eastward or west, so far that lady bear,"
27256,III,That France should hear no further of the pair.
27257,III,
27258,IV,IV
27259,IV,"So the two lovers, following her who flies,"
27260,IV,To other place than Paris might be brought:
27261,IV,But this calamity was a surprise
27262,IV,"On Malagigi, through his little thought;"
27263,IV,"And fiendish malice, banished from the skies,"
27264,IV,"Which ever blood and fire and ravage sought,"
27265,IV,Guided them by that way to Charles' disaster;
27266,IV,"Left to his choice by him, the wizard master."
27267,IV,
27268,V,V
27269,V,The wayward fiend who makes that palfrey ramp
27270,V,Bears off the frighted Doralice amain;
27271,V,"Nor river nor yet yawning ditch, or swamp,"
27272,V,"Wood, rock, or rugged cliff, the steed restrain;"
27273,V,"Till, traversing the French and English camp,"
27274,V,"And other squadrons of the mingled train,"
27275,V,"Beneath the holy flag of Christ arraid,"
27276,V,He to Granada's king the fair conveyed.
27277,V,
27278,VI,VI
27279,VI,The Sarzan and the Tartar the first day
27280,VI,That royal damsel a long while pursue;
27281,VI,Because her distant form they yet survey;
27282,VI,But finally they lose that lady's view;
27283,VI,"When, like a lyme-dog, whom the hunters lay"
27284,VI,"On hare or roebuck's trail, the valiant two"
27285,VI,"Follow upon her track, nor halt, till told"
27286,VI,That she is harboured in her father's hold.
27287,VI,
27288,VII,VII
27289,VII,"Guard thyself, Charles: for, lo! against thee blown"
27290,VII,"Is such a storm, that I no refuge see:"
27291,VII,"Nor these redoubted monarchs come alone,"
27292,VII,But those of Sericane and Circassy;
27293,VII,"While Fortune, who would probe thee to the bone,"
27294,VII,"Has taken those two shining stars from thee,"
27295,VII,Who kept thee by their wisdom and their light;
27296,VII,And thou remainest blind and wrapt in night.
27297,VII,
27298,VIII,VIII
27299,VIII,'Tis of the valiant cousins I would speak:
27300,VIII,"Of these, Orlando of his wit bereft,"
27301,VIII,"Naked, in sun or shower, by plain or peak,"
27302,VIII,"Wanders about the world, a helpless weft;"
27303,VIII,"And he, in wisdom little less to seek,"
27304,VIII,"Rinaldo, in thy peril thee has left;"
27305,VIII,"And, for in Paris-town she is not found,"
27306,VIII,In search of his Angelica is bound.
27307,VIII,
27308,IX,IX
27309,IX,"A cunning, old enchanter him deceived,"
27310,IX,As in the outlet of my tale was said:
27311,IX,"Deluded by a phantom, he believed"
27312,IX,Angelica was with Orlando fled;
27313,IX,"And hence with jealousy, at heart, aggrieved"
27314,IX,(Lover ne'er suffered worse) to Paris sped;
27315,IX,"Whence he, as soon as he appeared at court,"
27316,IX,"By chance, was named to Britain to resort."
27317,IX,
27318,X,X
27319,X,"Now, the field won, wherein with mickle fame"
27320,X,"He drove King Agramant his works behind,"
27321,X,"To Paris yet again the warrior came,"
27322,X,"Searched convent, tower, and house, and, save confined"
27323,X,"'Twixt solid walls or columns be the dame,"
27324,X,Her will the restless lover surely find:
27325,X,"Nor her nor yet Orlando he descries,"
27326,X,So forth in the desire to seek them hies.
27327,X,
27328,XI,XI
27329,XI,"Her to Anglantes or to Brava brought,"
27330,XI,He deemed the Count enjoyed in mirth and play;
27331,XI,"And vainly, here and there, that damsel sought,"
27332,XI,"Nor here nor there, descried the long-sought prey."
27333,XI,"To Paris he repaired again, in thought"
27334,XI,The paladin returning to waylay;
27335,XI,Because he deemed he could not rove at large
27336,XI,"Without that Town, but on some special charge."
27337,XI,
27338,XII,XII
27339,XII,Within he takes a day or two's repose;
27340,XII,"And, when he finds Orlando comes not there,"
27341,XII,Again to Brava and Anglantes goes
27342,XII,Inquiring tidings of the royal fair;
27343,XII,"Nor, whether morning dawns or noontide glows,"
27344,XII,-- Nor night nor day -- his weary steed does spare;
27345,XII,Nor once -- but twice a hundred times -- has run
27346,XII,"The selfsame course, by light of moon or sun."
27347,XII,
27348,XIII,XIII
27349,XIII,"But the ancient foe, deluded by whose say,"
27350,XIII,"To the forbidden fruit Eve raised her hand,"
27351,XIII,"Turned his wan eyes on Charlemagne one day,"
27352,XIII,When he the good Rinaldo absent scanned;
27353,XIII,And seeing what foul rout and disarray
27354,XIII,"Might at that time be given to Charles's band,"
27355,XIII,Of all the Saracens the choice and flower
27356,XIII,Marshalled in arms against the Christian power.
27357,XIII,
27358,XIV,XIV
27359,XIV,King Sacripant and King Gradasso (who
27360,XIV,"Whilere companionship in war had made,"
27361,XIV,When from Atlantes' palace fled the two)
27362,XIV,"Together to unite their arms, in aid"
27363,XIV,"Of royal Agramant's beleaguered crew,"
27364,XIV,"And where through unknown lands the warriors hied,"

27371,XV,With the affrighted Doralice to fare:
27372,XV,"A third, lest they their enterprize forego,"
27373,XV,Rogero and Marphisa has in care:
27374,XV,But their conductor journeys not so fast;
27375,XV,And hence that martial pair arrives the last.
27376,XV,
27377,XVI,XVI
27378,XVI,"Later by half an hour, against their foes,"
27379,XVI,"So matched, Rogero and Marphisa speed;"
27380,XVI,"Because the sable angel, who his blows"
27381,XVI,"Aimed at the bands that held the Christian creed,"
27382,XVI,"Provided, that the contest which arose"
27383,XVI,"About that horse, his work should not impede;"
27384,XVI,"Which had again been kindled, had the twain,"
27385,XVI,"Rodomont and Rogero, met again."
27386,XVI,
27387,XVII,XVII
27388,XVII,The first four ride until themselves they find
27389,XVII,Where the besiegers and besieged they view;
27390,XVII,"And see the banners shaking in the wind,"
27391,XVII,And the cantonments of those armies two.
27392,XVII,"Here they short counsel took, and next opined,"
27393,XVII,"In spite of Charlemagne's beleaguering crew,"
27394,XVII,"To carry speedy succour to their liege,"
27395,XVII,And rescue royal Agramant from siege.

27401,XVIII,Whom at all points the Franks for paynims know.
27402,XVIII,"-- ""To arms, to arms!"" throughout their camp is heard:"
27403,XVIII,But first is felt the Moorish sabre's blow:
27404,XVIII,"Even on the rear-guard falls the vengeful stroke,"
27405,XVIII,"Not charged alone, but routed, beat and broke."
27406,XVIII,
27407,XIX,XIX
27408,XIX,"The Christian host throughout is overthrown,"
27409,XIX,"And how they know not, in tumultuous wise;"
27410,XIX,And that it is a wonted insult done
27411,XIX,"By Switzer or by Gascon, some surmise;"
27412,XIX,But -- since the reason is to most unknown --
27413,XIX,"Each several nation to its standard flies,"
27414,XIX,"This to the drum, that to the trumpet's sound,"
27415,XIX,And shriek and shout from earth to heaven redound.

27417,XX,XX
27418,XX,"All armed is Charlemagne, except his head,"

27421,XX,Disorder in his host and disarray;
27422,XX,"And stopt with menace this or that who fled,"
27423,XX,"And many fugitives, upon their way,"
27424,XX,"Some with maimed face, breast, arm, or hand, espied,"

27428,XXI,"Advancing, he on earth saw many more,"
27429,XXI,"Or rather in a lake of crimson laid,"
27430,XXI,"Horribly weltering in their own dark gore,"
27431,XXI,Beyond the leech's and magician's aid;
27432,XXI,"And busts dissevered from the heads they bore,"
27433,XXI,And legs and arms -- a cruel show -- surveyed;
27434,XXI,"And, from the first cantonments to the last,"
27435,XXI,Saw slaughtered men on all sides as he past.
27436,XXI,
27437,XXII,XXII
27438,XXII,"Where the small band advances in such wise,"
27439,XXII,"Deserving well eternal praise to gain,"
27440,XXII,"Vouching their deeds, a long-drawn furrow lies,"
27441,XXII,A signal record of their might and main.
27442,XXII,"His army's cruel slaughter, with surprise,"
27443,XXII,"Anger and rage, is viewed by Charlemagne."
27444,XXII,"So he whose shattered walls have felt its force,"
27445,XXII,Throughout his mansion tracks the lightning's course.

27451,XXIII,"Rogero and Marphisa, thither made."
27452,XXIII,"When, once or twice, that worthy pair a view"
27453,XXIII,"Have taken of the ground, and have surveyed"

27455,XXIII,They swiftly move in succour of their lord.
27456,XXIII,
27457,XXIV,XXIV
27458,XXIV,"As when we spark to loaded mine apply,"
27459,XXIV,"Through the long furrow, filled with sable grain,"
27460,XXIV,"So fast the furious wildfire darts, that eye"
27461,XXIV,Pursues the progress of the flash with pain;
27462,XXIV,"And as dire ruin follows, and from high,"
27463,XXIV,"The loosened rock and solid bastion rain,"
27464,XXIV,So bold Rogero and Marphisa rush
27465,XXIV,"To battle, so the Christian squadrons crush."
27466,XXIV,
27467,XXV,XXV
27468,XXV,"Front and askance, the assailants smote, and low"

27470,XXV,Where'er the Christian squadrons were too slow
27471,XXV,To free the path and break their close array.
27472,XXV,"Whoe'er has seen the passing tempest blow,"
27473,XXV,"And of the hill or valley, in its way,"
27474,XXV,"One portion ravage and another leave,"

27477,XXVI,XXVI
27478,XXVI,"Many who had escaped by quick retreat,"
27479,XXVI,"Rodomont and those other furious three,"
27480,XXVI,"Thank God that he had given them legs and feet,"
27481,XXVI,Wherewith to fly from that calamity;
27482,XXVI,And from the Child and damsel new defeat
27483,XXVI,"Encounter, while with endlong course they flee:"
27484,XXVI,"As man, no matter if he stands or run,"
27485,XXVI,Seeks vainly his predestined doom to shun.
27486,XXVI,
27487,XXVII,XXVII
27488,XXVII,"Who 'scape one peril, into other fly,"
27489,XXVII,And pay the penalty of flesh and blood;
27490,XXVII,"So, by the teeth of dog, is wont to die"
27491,XXVII,"The fox, together with her infant brood,"
27492,XXVII,By one who dwells her ancient cavern nigh
27493,XXVII,"Unearthed, and with a thousand blows pursued;"
27494,XXVII,"When from some unsuspected place, that foe"

27501,XXVIII,Thank Heaven for the success of that emprize:
27502,XXVIII,The paladins no longer are their fear;
27503,XXVIII,The meanest Moor a hundred Franks defies;
27504,XXVIII,"And 'tis resolved, without repose, again"
27505,XXVIII,To drench with Christian blood the thirsty plain.

27511,XXIX,Banner and gonfalon of various dyes.
27512,XXIX,The Germans and the warlike Bretons close;
27513,XXIX,"Ranged on the other part, in martial wise,"
27514,XXIX,"Italians, English, French, were seen, and through"

27531,XXXI,"To be conceived, much less described aright:"
27532,XXXI,The number slaughtered hence may you surmise!
27533,XXXI,What cruel blow King Charles sustained in fight!

27561,XXXIV,Rising above this dim and troubled air;

27573,XXXV,"To stir the Moors to strife, nor had obeyed;"
27574,XXXV,"Had rather in their eyes who marked the event,"

27632,XLI,"Nor will she yield her place to any one,"
27633,XLI,"No, not a single hour, yet less a day;"

27642,XLII,"Rogero to King Agramant appealed,"
27643,XLII,"As having borne too long, though sore offended,"

27646,XLII,
27647,XLIII,XLIII
27648,XLIII,"The Tartar king, for more perplexity,"
27649,XLIII,Denied on any ground Rogero's right

27651,XLIII,"And was so passing wood with wrath and spite,"
27652,XLIII,"That, if to this those others would agree,"

27656,XLIII,
27657,XLIV,XLIV
27658,XLIV,"King Agramant, with prayer and kingly word,"

27660,XLIV,"But since the foes were deaf to all accord,"
27661,XLIV,"Nor would assent to peace or truce anew,"
27662,XLIV,Considered how at least he might afford
27663,XLIV,The field of each of them in order due;
27664,XLIV,"And, as the best resolve, at last decreed,"
27665,XLIV,Each should by lot possess the listed mead.
27666,XLIV,
27667,XLV,XLV
27668,XLV,"Four lots the monarch bade prepare, which done,"

27674,XLV,"The lots are drawn, and in the first appear"
27675,XLV,The Tartar king and sovereign of Argier.
27676,XLV,
27677,XLVI,XLVI
27678,XLVI,Rogero and Mandricardo for that play
27679,XLVI,Were next; Rogero and Rodomont were third;
27680,XLVI,Marphisa's lot and Mardricardo's lay
27681,XLVI,At bottom; whence the dame was deeply stirred;
27682,XLVI,Nor young Rogero seems a whit more gay:
27683,XLVI,Who knows the prowess of those two preferred
27684,XLVI,Will nothing in the listed combat leave
27685,XLVI,For him or for Marphisa to achieve.

27689,XLVII,"Covering a mile or somewhat less, and round;"
27690,XLVII,"Like ancient theatre, on every side,"
27691,XLVII,Encompast by a tall and solid mound;
27692,XLVII,"With castle whilom was it fortified,"
27693,XLVII,Which sword and fire had levelled with the ground.
27694,XLVII,"The Parmesan like circle does survey,"

27697,XLVIII,XLVIII
27698,XLVIII,"In this place is prepared the listed mead,"

27700,XLVIII,"A square, of just proportions for that need,"
27701,XLVIII,"With two capacious gates, as usage goes."
27702,XLVIII,The day on which to combat have agreed
27703,XLVIII,"Those valiant knights, who will not balk their foes,"
27704,XLVIII,"Beside the palisades, to left and right,"

27708,XLIX,"In that, which looks towards the western sun,"

27711,XLIX,Bold Ferrau and Circassia's cavalier.
27712,XLIX,"Gradasso and the puissant Falsiron,"

27734,LI,"Two costly vests -- one red, one green -- she wore;"

27736,LI,
27737,LII,LII
27738,LII,In dress succinct Marphisa sate; in plight

27741,LII,And her fair squadron in like garb arrayed.
27742,LII,"Afield already, in his livery dight,"
27743,LII,"Agramant's herald made proclaim, and said"

27747,LIII,LIII
27748,LIII,The frequent crowd expects the double foe;
27749,LIII,"And often, in impatience, they complain,"
27750,LIII,And call those famous cavaliers too slow:
27751,LIII,When from the Tartar's tent an angry strain
27752,LIII,"Is heard, and cries which multiply; sir, know"
27753,LIII,"It was the martial king of Sericane,"
27754,LIII,"And puissant Tartar, who that question stirred,"

27781,LVI,Fierce battle for that sword with Brava's knight;
27782,LVI,"Who feigned himself of sober sense foregone,"
27783,LVI,Hoping that so he should conceal his fright:

28058,LXXXIV,"The king bade Sacripant explain his right,"
28059,LXXXIV,And how that horse was taken from him sought;
28060,LXXXIV,And this from first to last Circassia's knight
28061,LXXXIV,"Rehearsed, and reddened as the tale he taught,"
28062,LXXXIV,Relating to the king the robber's sleight;
28063,LXXXIV,"Who had surprised him overwhelmed with thought,"
28064,LXXXIV,"Upon four spears his courser's saddle stayed,"

28069,LXXXV,"When of the robbery of the horse advised,"
28070,LXXXV,"In visage is disturbed, remembering"
28071,LXXXV,How on that day her faulchion was surprised;
28072,LXXXV,And when that courser (which equipt with wing
28073,LXXXV,Appeared when flying her) she recognized;
28074,LXXXV,And recognized as well -- at first unknown --
28075,LXXXV,The valiant king who filled Circassia's throne.
28076,LXXXV,
28077,LXXXVI,LXXXVI
28078,LXXXVI,"The others who stood round her, wont to hear"

28080,LXXXVI,"'Gan turn towards that wretch, and made appear"
28081,LXXXVI,By open signs they knew him for the Cheat.
28082,LXXXVI,Marphisa who the subtle knave whilere
28083,LXXXVI,"Suspected as the author of that feat,"
28084,LXXXVI,"Now questions this, now that, who all accord"
28085,LXXXVI,In saying 'twas Brunello stole her sword;

28088,LXXXVII,"Who, well deserving as a fitting pain"
28089,LXXXVII,"To dangle from the gallows-tree in air,"
28090,LXXXVII,By Agramant the crown of Tingitane
28091,LXXXVII,(An ill example) was preferred to wear.
28092,LXXXVII,"This fires anew Marphisa's old disdain,"
28093,LXXXVII,"Nor she from instant vengeance will forbear,"
28094,LXXXVII,"For this, as well as other shame and scorn"
28095,LXXXVII,She on her road had from that caitiff born.
28096,LXXXVII,
28097,LXXXVIII,LXXXVIII
28098,LXXXVIII,"A squire laced on her helmet, at her hest;"

28101,LXXXVIII,"Find I, that she ten times was ever seen,"
28102,LXXXVIII,Even from the day when first that iron vest
28103,LXXXVIII,Braced on her limbs the passing-valiant queen:
28104,LXXXVIII,"With helm on head, where, mid the highest rows,"
28105,LXXXVIII,"Brunello sits among the first, she goes."

28107,LXXXIX,LXXXIX
28108,LXXXIX,"Him by mid breast Marphisa griped amain,"

28110,LXXXIX,As is rapacious eagle wont to strain
28111,LXXXIX,"The pullet, in her talons circled round;"
28112,LXXXIX,And bore him where the sons of King Troyane
28113,LXXXIX,Heard the two knights their jarring claims propound.
28114,LXXXIX,"He who perceives himself in evil hands,"
28115,LXXXIX,"Aye weeps, and mercy of that maid demands."

28121,XC,"For pity now, and now for succour, cried,"
28122,XC,"So loud was heard, that of that ample rout"
28123,XC,He gathered round himself the pressing tide.
28124,XC,"Arrived before the Moorish army's head,"
28125,XC,To him with haughty mien Marphisa said:

28127,XCI,XCI
28128,XCI,"""This thief (said she), thy vassal, will I slay,"
28129,XCI,And with this hand of mine will knot the cord
28130,XCI,About his neck; because the very day
28131,XCI,"He stole this courser, he purloined my sword."
28132,XCI,But is there any one who deems I say
28133,XCI,"Amiss, let him stand forth and speak the word;"
28134,XCI,"For I on him will prove, before thine eyes,"
28135,XCI,"I have done right, and who gainsays me, lies."
28136,XCI,
28137,XCII,XCII
28138,XCII,"""But because haply some one may pretend"
28139,XCII,I have till such a time of strife delayed
28140,XCII,"My vengeance, when such famous knights contend,"
28141,XCII,For three days shall the wretch's doom be stayed;
28142,XCII,In the mean time let him who would defend
28143,XCII,"That caitiff, come himself, or send him aid."
28144,XCII,"For afterwards, if none the deed prevent,"
28145,XCII,His carcass shall a thousand birds content.

28147,XCIII,XCIII
28148,XCIII,"""I hence to yonder tower, which distant nigh"
28149,XCIII,"Three leagues, o'erlooks a little copse, repair,"

28152,XCIII,"Rescue the thief, let him come thither; I"
28153,XCIII,"Wait the approach of his defenders there."""
28154,XCIII,Thus she; and thither quickly wends her ways
28155,XCIII,"Whither was said, nor any answer stays."

28157,XCIV,XCIV
28158,XCIV,"Held on the pommel grappled by his hair,"
28159,XCIV,Brunello on Marphisa's courser lies:
28160,XCIV,"The caitiff weeps, and shrieking in despair,"
28161,XCIV,"On all in whom he hopes, for succour cries."
28162,XCIV,"In such confusion is Troyano's heir,"
28163,XCIV,He sees no way through these perplexities;
28164,XCIV,"And, that Marphisa thence Brunello bore"
28165,XCIV,"In such a guise, yet grieved the monarch more."
28166,XCIV,
28167,XCV,XCV
28168,XCV,"Not that he loved the losel or esteemed,"
28169,XCV,Rather to him some time had borne despite;
28170,XCV,"And often had to hand the caitiff schemed,"
28171,XCV,Since he had forfeited the ring of might.
28172,XCV,"But here his honour touched the monarch deemed,"
28173,XCV,So that his visage reddened at the slight:
28174,XCV,"He would, in person, follow her at speed,"
28175,XCV,And to his utmost power avenge the deed.
28176,XCV,
28177,XCVI,XCVI
28178,XCVI,"But the wise king, Sobrino, who was by,"
28179,XCVI,"Him from the quest endeavoured to dissuade,"
28180,XCVI,And that with his exalted majesty
28181,XCVI,Such enterprize were ill assorted said:
28182,XCVI,"Although firm hope, nay full security,"
28183,XCVI,"He had to overcome that martial maid,"
28184,XCVI,"If he with pain subdued a woman, shame,"
28185,XCVI,"Rather than honour, would pursue his name."
28186,XCVI,
28187,XCVII,XCVII
28188,XCVII,Small profit and much peril would succeed
28189,XCVII,"From any fight he should with her maintain,"
28190,XCVII,"(And he advised him) as the better deed,"
28191,XCVII,To leave that wretched caitiff to his pain;
28192,XCVII,And albeit but a simple nod should need
28193,XCVII,"To free him, from that nod he should refrain."
28194,XCVII,In that the monarch would do ill to force
28195,XCVII,Even-handed Justice from her destined course.
28196,XCVII,
28197,XCVIII,XCVIII
28198,XCVIII,"""Thou to the fierce Marphisa may'st apply"
28199,XCVIII,"To leave his trial (he pursued) to thee,"
28200,XCVIII,"With promise, her in this to satisfy"
28201,XCVIII,And to suspend him from the gallows-tree:
28202,XCVIII,"And even should the maid thy prayer deny,"
28203,XCVIII,Let her in every wish contented be:
28204,XCVIII,"And rather than that she desert thy side,"
28205,XCVIII,"Let her hang him and every thief beside."""
28206,XCVIII,
28207,XCIX,XCIX
28208,XCIX,Right willingly King Agramant gave way
28209,XCIX,To King Sobrino's counsel sage and staid;
28210,XCIX,"And let renowned Marphisa wend her way,"
28211,XCIX,"Nor scathed he, nor let scathe, that martial maid,"
28212,XCIX,Neither endured that any her should pray;
28213,XCIX,And heaven knows with what courage he obeyed
28214,XCIX,"That wise advice, to calm such ruder strife"
28215,XCIX,"And quarrel, as throughout his camp were rife."

28222,C,"Pride gamboled and rejoiced with her compeer,"
28223,C,"And on the fire fresh food and fuel threw,"

28241,CII,That ill Apollo's self could judge the feud.
28242,CII,To unravel that first cause of enmity
28243,CII,"The king began -- the strife which had ensued,"
28244,CII,"Because of beauteous Doralice, between"

28251,CIII,Like faithful brother and like righteous lord:
28252,CIII,"But when he found that neither would forbear,"
28253,CIII,"Deaf and rebellious to his royal word,"
28254,CIII,"Nor would consent that lady to forego,"
28255,CIII,"The cause of strife, in favour of his foe,"
28256,CIII,
28257,CIV,CIV
28258,CIV,"As his best lore, at length the monarch said,"

28260,CIV,"That he who was by her preferred, should wed"
28261,CIV,The beauteous daughter of King Stordilane:
28262,CIV,And that what was established on his head
28263,CIV,"Should not be changed, to either's loss or gain."
28264,CIV,"The compromise was liked on either side,"

28281,CVI,"But he, who oft was with her on their round,"
28282,CVI,"And oftener private with the youthful queen,"
28283,CVI,"What time the tell-tale sun was under ground,"
28284,CVI,"He, knowing well how sure he was to speed,"

28295,CVII,He cannot raise his visage from the ground.

28297,CVIII,CVIII
28298,CVIII,But wonted anger chasing shame which dyed

28308,CIX,"Kind Mandricardo on his feet once more,"

28313,CIX,Ruling that to appeal upon that plea
28314,CIX,"No more with Mandricardo could avail,"

28318,CX,"Branded with double scorn, before those peers,"

28327,CXI,CXI
28328,CXI,As the afflicted bull who has foregone
28329,CXI,"His heifer, nor can longer warfare wage,"

28331,CXI,Or sands at distance from his pasturage;
28332,CXI,"There ceases not, in sun or shade to moan;"
28333,CXI,Yet not for that exhales his amorous rage:
28334,CXI,"So parts, constrained his lady to forego,"

28352,CXIII,"But Sacripant, whom, like the youthful knight,"
28353,CXIII,"No quarrels in the Moor's pursuit impede,"
28354,CXIII,"And who was unengaged in other quest,"
28355,CXIII,Upon the Sarzan's footsteps quickly prest;
28356,CXIII,

28362,CXIV,"A woman who had fallen into the Saone,"
28363,CXIV,"And who without his help had perished there,"
28364,CXIV,"The warrior drowning in that water found,"
28365,CXIV,And stemmed the stream and dragged the dame aground.

28367,CXV,CXV
28368,CXV,"When afterwards he would remount the sell,"
28369,CXV,"From him his restless charger broke astray,"
28370,CXV,"Who fled before his lord till evening fell,"
28371,CXV,Nor lightly did the king that courser stay.
28372,CXV,At last he caught him; but no more could spell
28373,CXV,Where he had wandered from the beaten way:
28374,CXV,"Two hundred miles he roved, 'twist hill and plain,"
28375,CXV,Ere he came up with Rodomont again.
28376,CXV,
28377,CXVI,CXVI
28378,CXVI,"How he by Sacripant was overtaken,"

28381,CXVI,"I say not now, who have to say before,"
28382,CXVI,"With what disdain and with what anger shaken,"
28383,CXVI,"Against his liege and love, the Sarzan Moor"
28384,CXVI,"Forth from the Saracen cantonments sped,"

28387,CXVII,CXVII
28388,CXVII,"Wherever that afflicted paynim goes,"
28389,CXVII,He fills the kindling air with sighs that burn;
28390,CXVII,"And Echo oft, for pity of his woes,"
28391,CXVII,With him from hollow rock is heard to mourn:
28392,CXVII,"""O female mind!  how lightly ebbs and flows"

28522,CXXX,-- His courser stalled -- the board with plenteous fare
28523,CXXX,"Is heaped, and Corsic wine and Grecian flows;"
28524,CXXX,"For, in all else a Moor, the Sarzan drank"
28525,CXXX,Of the forbidden vintage like a Frank.

28528,CXXXI,"To warlike Rodomont, with goodly cheer"

28533,CXXXI,"Had scarce his heart within him, which had strayed"
28534,CXXXI,To her -- whilere his own -- in his despite;

28551,CXXXIII,He never once looks any in the face.
28552,CXXXIII,"Next, after silence long, and many sighs,"
28553,CXXXIII,"As if deep slumber had but then given place,"
28554,CXXXIII,"His spirits he recalls, his eyelids raises,"
28555,CXXXIII,And on the family and landlord gazes.

28559,CXXXIV,"And visage somewhat less disturbed, applied"
28560,CXXXIV,"To him, the host, and those by-standers there,"
28561,CXXXIV,To know if any to a wife were tied;
28562,CXXXIV,"And landlord and attendants, -- that all were,"
28563,CXXXIV,To Sarza's moody cavalier replied:
28564,CXXXIV,"He asked what each conceited of his spouse,"
28565,CXXXIV,And if he deemed her faithful to her vows.

28567,CXXXV,CXXXV

28591,CXXXVII,"For my good fortune, to this inn was brought,"
28592,CXXXVII,My ignorance by his examples true
28593,CXXXVII,"So ably schooled, he better wisdom taught."
28594,CXXXVII,Valerio was the name that stranger bore;

28644,I,"To this, the landlord's tale, replete with lies,"
28645,I,In shame and scorn of womankind; though ne'er

28647,I,From such a caitiff's tongue; and still we hear

28776,XIV,"The grief which, day and night, her bosom rent,"

30122,LIX,He had gone naked forth in sun and shade.
30123,LIX,"Had he been born on hot Syene's site,"
30124,LIX,"Or sands where worship is to Ammon paid,"
30125,LIX,"Or nigh those hills, whence Nile's full waters spin,"
30126,LIX,Orlando had not borne a dingier skin.

30153,LXII,"He from his shoulders hoped to cleave his head,"
30154,LXII,But found the madman's skin as hard as bone;
30155,LXII,"Yea, harder far than steel, nor to be harmed;"
30156,LXII,So good Orlando at his birth was charmed.
30157,LXII,
30158,LXIII,LXIII

30164,LXIII,Was by the madman's furious stroke laid low.
30165,LXIII,"In the same breath Orlando turned anew,"
30166,LXIII,And chased the damsel that before him flew.

30173,LXIV,"Her ring she thought upon, and this the fair"
30174,LXIV,Placed in her mouth; nor failed its virtue now;
30175,LXIV,"For putting it between her lips, like light"

30182,LXV,(For neither this nor that I surely weet)
30183,LXV,"Angelica, while 'twixt her lips she slipt"
30184,LXV,"The virtuous ring, and hid her visage sweet,"
30185,LXV,"Her stirrups lost; and, tumbling form the sell,"
30186,LXV,Reversed upon the sand that lady fell.
30187,LXV,
30188,LXVI,LXVI
30189,LXVI,"If but two inches short had fallen his prey,"
30190,LXVI,Upon her would have pounced Orlando near;
30191,LXVI,"Who would have crushed her in his furious way,"
30192,LXVI,But that kind Fortune saved her from the peer.
30193,LXVI,Let her by other theft herself purvey
30194,LXVI,"With other palfrey, as she did whilere;"
30195,LXVI,"For never will she have this courser more,"
30196,LXVI,Who chased by swift Orlando scours the shore.
30197,LXVI,
30198,LXVII,LXVII
30199,LXVII,Doubt not that she another will provide;
30200,LXVII,And follow we in mad Orlando's rear;
30201,LXVII,"Whose rage and fury nevermore subside,"
30202,LXVII,Wroth that Angelica should disappear:
30203,LXVII,"After that beast along the sands he hied,"
30204,LXVII,Aye gaining on the mare in this career.
30205,LXVII,"Now, now he touches her, and lo!  The mane"
30206,LXVII,"He grasps, and now secures her by the rein."
30207,LXVII,
30208,LXVIII,LXVIII
30209,LXVIII,Orlando seizes her with that delight
30210,LXVIII,That other man might seize a damsel fair;

30212,LXVIII,"Springs on her back, and o'er the sea-beach bare"
30213,LXVIII,"For many miles impels the palfrey's flight,"
30214,LXVIII,"Without repose or pause, now here, now there:"
30215,LXVIII,"Nor ever sell or bridle be displaced,"
30216,LXVIII,Nor let her grass or heartening forage taste.
30217,LXVIII,
30218,LXIX,LXIX
30219,LXIX,"As in this course to o'erleap a ditch he sought,"
30220,LXIX,"Head over heels, she with her rider went:"
30221,LXIX,"Nor harmed was he, nor felt that tumble aright;"
30222,LXIX,"But she, with shoulder slipt, lay foully shent."
30223,LXIX,"Long how to bear her thence Orlando thought,"
30224,LXIX,And in the end upon his shoulders hent.
30225,LXIX,"He from the bottom climbed, thus loaded sore,"
30226,LXIX,And carried her three bow-shots' length and more.
30227,LXIX,
30228,LXX,LXX
30229,LXX,"Next, for he felt that weight too irksome grow,"
30230,LXX,"He put her down, to lead her by the rein;"

30232,LXX,"""Come on,"" Orlando cried, and cried in vain;"

30234,LXX,This ill would satisfy his mood insane.

30242,LXXI,Is scathed by stones which that ill road o'erspread.
30243,LXXI,"At length the misused beast, with wear and tear"
30244,LXXI,"Of the rude rocks, and suffering sore, lies dead."

30492,XXI,"""And -- would ye do what most would me delight,"
30493,XXI,And be an obligation evermore --
30494,XXI,You shall by casting lots decide your right:
30495,XXI,"Premising, he whose lot is drawn before"
30496,XXI,"The other, shall upon two quarrels fight:"
30497,XXI,"So he who wins, on his companion's score"
30498,XXI,Shall win as well as on his own; and who
30499,XXI,Loses the battle lose alike for two.

30501,XXII,XXII
30502,XXII,"""Between Rogero and Gradasso, we"
30503,XXII,"Deem there is little difference, rather none;"
30504,XXII,And wot whichever shall elected be.
30505,XXII,"In arms will make his martial prowess known,"
30506,XXII,"As for the rest, let doubtful victory"
30507,XXII,Descend on him whom Heaven is pleased to own!
30508,XXII,"Upon the vanquished knight no blame shall fall,"
30509,XXII,"But we to Fortune will impute it all."""
30510,XXII,
30511,XXIII,XXIII
30512,XXIII,"Rogero and Gradasso, at this say"
30513,XXIII,"Of Agramant, stood silent, and agreed,"
30514,XXIII,"That he whose lot first issued, the assay"
30515,XXIII,Should undertake for both in listed mead.
30516,XXIII,"Thus in two scrolls, inscribed in the same way,"
30517,XXIII,Their names are writ as destined to succeed.
30518,XXIII,"These afterwards are cast into an urn,"
30519,XXIII,Which much they shake and topsy turvy turn.
30520,XXIII,
30521,XXIV,XXIV
30522,XXIV,A seely boy then dipt his hand and drew
30523,XXIV,"A billet from the vase, and if befel,"
30524,XXIV,Thereon Rogero's name the assistants knew;
30525,XXIV,-- Gradasso's left behind -- I cannot tell
30526,XXIV,"How joyed renowned Rogero at the view,"
30527,XXIV,And can as little say what sorrow fell
30528,XXIV,"Upon Gradasso, on the other side;"
30529,XXIV,But he parforce his fortune must abide.
30530,XXIV,
30531,XXV,XXV
30532,XXV,Gradasso every thought and every deed
30533,XXV,"Employs, Rogero to instruct and aid,"
30534,XXV,That in the strife his champion may succeed;
30535,XXV,And teaches every sleight he has assaid:
30536,XXV,-- How best to manage sword and shield at need --
30537,XXV,"-- What strokes are feints, and what with vantage made --"
30538,XXV,"And when he should tempt Fortune, when eschew --"
30539,XXV,"Reminds him, one by one, in long review."
30540,XXV,
30541,XXVI,XXVI
30542,XXVI,"After the drawing lots and king's award,"
30543,XXVI,What of the day remained the champions spent
30544,XXVI,"As wont, in giving tokens of regard,"
30545,XXVI,To this or to that other warrior sent.
30546,XXVI,"The people, greedy for the fight, toward"
30547,XXVI,"The field is gone, and many not content"
30548,XXVI,"With wending thither ere the dawn of light,"
30549,XXVI,Upon the place of combat watch all night.
30550,XXVI,
30551,XXVII,XXVII
30552,XXVII,The foolish rabble anxiously attends
30553,XXVII,"Those goodly champions' contest for the prize,"
30554,XXVII,A crowd which neither sees nor comprehends
30555,XXVII,Other than that which is before its eyes.
30556,XXVII,"But they who know what boots and what offends,"
30557,XXVII,"-- Marsilius and Sobrino, and the wise --"
30558,XXVII,"Censure the fight, and monarch that affords"
30559,XXVII,A field of combat to those martial lords.
30560,XXVII,
30561,XXVIII,XXVIII
30562,XXVIII,Nor what a heavy loss he would sustain
30563,XXVIII,(Cease they to royal Agramant to read)
30564,XXVIII,Were Mandricardo or Rogero slain;
30565,XXVIII,A thing by cruel Destiny decreed.
30566,XXVIII,"Since they, to combat against Charlemagne,"
30567,XXVIII,Of one of these alone have greater need
30568,XXVIII,"Than of ten thousand more, amid which crew"
30569,XXVIII,They scarce would find one champion good and true.
30570,XXVIII,
30571,XXIX,XXIX
30572,XXIX,Agramant recognized this truth; but thought
30573,XXIX,That ill his royal word could be repealed;
30574,XXIX,Yet Mandricardo and the Child besought
30575,XXIX,"That they the right, conferred by him, would yield:"
30576,XXIX,"More; that the question was a thing of nought,"
30577,XXIX,Nor worthy to be tried in martial field;
30578,XXIX,And prayed them -- would they not obey his hest
30579,XXIX,"At least somewhile, to let their quarrel rest."
30580,XXIX,
30581,XXX,XXX
30582,XXX,"Five or six months would they the strife delay,"
30583,XXX,"Or more or less, till Charles defeated were,"
30584,XXX,"And stript of mantle, crown, and royal sway."
30585,XXX,"But each, though he would willingly forbear,"
30586,XXX,"And much desired his sovereign to obey,"
30587,XXX,Stood out against the Moorish monarch's prayer:
30588,XXX,Since either deemed he would be foully shent
30589,XXX,Who to this treaty first should yield consent.
30590,XXX,
30591,XXXI,XXXI
30592,XXXI,"But more than king, than all, who sought in vain"
30593,XXXI,"To soften Agrican's infuriate son,"
30594,XXXI,The beauteous daughter of King Stordilane
30595,XXXI,"Lamented, besought him, woe-begone,"
30596,XXXI,Besought him he would do what all would fain
30597,XXXI,Behold by the relenting warrior done;
30598,XXXI,"-- Lamenting her, as through the cavalier,"
30599,XXXI,For ever kept in agony and fear.
30600,XXXI,
30601,XXXII,XXXII
30602,XXXII,"""Alas!  and what (exclaims she) can I find"
30603,XXXII,"Which may avail to minister repose,"
30604,XXXII,"If aye, by this or that desire inclined,"
30605,XXXII,You don your harness to affront new foes?
30606,XXXII,What boots it to restore my harassed mind
30607,XXXII,"That I behold one fearful quarrel's close,"
30608,XXXII,"Against one champion moved for love of me,"
30609,XXXII,If one as fierce already kindled be?

30612,XXXIII,"""Woe worth me!  I was proud, with little right,"
30613,XXXIII,"So good a king, so stout a cavalier"
30614,XXXIII,For he should in the fierce and dangerous fight
30615,XXXIII,"Peril his life, who now, I see to clear,"
30616,XXXIII,"Upon a ground of strife so passing light,"
30617,XXXIII,With the same risk prepares to couch the spear.
30618,XXXIII,"You, more than love for me, to strife impels"
30619,XXXIII,"The natural rage, wherewith your bosom swells."
30620,XXXIII,
30621,XXXIV,XXXIV
30622,XXXIV,"""But if the love you force yourself to show,"
30623,XXXIV,"Be in good earnest, that which you profess,"

30625,XXXIV,"Which does my spirit, does my heart oppress,"
30626,XXXIV,"Be not concerned, because the bird of snow"
30627,XXXIV,"Rogero, pictured on his shield, possess."
30628,XXXIV,I know not wherefore you should joy or grieve
30629,XXXIV,That he the blazoned buckler bear or leave.

30632,XXXV,"""Much evil may ensue and little gain"
30633,XXXV,Out of the battle you to wage prepare;
30634,XXXV,Small guerdon will be bought with mickle pain
30635,XXXV,If from Rogero you his eagle bear;
30636,XXXV,"But if your fortune shifts on listed plain,"
30637,XXXV,"She whom you hold not captive by her hair,"
30638,XXXV,"You cause an evil with such mischief fraught,"
30639,XXXV,My heart is broken at the simple thought.
30640,XXXV,
30641,XXXVI,XXXVI
30642,XXXVI,"""If of small value life to you appear,"
30643,XXXVI,"And you esteem a painted bird more high,"
30644,XXXVI,At least for my life's sake esteem yours dear;
30645,XXXVI,For one without the other shall not die.
30646,XXXVI,With you to die excites in me no fear;
30647,XXXVI,"With you, prepared for life or death am I:"
30648,XXXVI,"Yet would I fain not die so ill content,"
30649,XXXVI,"As I should die if you before me went."""
30650,XXXVI,
30651,XXXVII,XXXVII
30652,XXXVII,"Accompanying words with tears and sighs,"
30653,XXXVII,"In such, or such like speech she him did pray,"
30654,XXXVII,"Throughout that livelong night, in piteous wise,"
30655,XXXVII,Hoping her lover's anger to allay;
30656,XXXVII,"And Mandricardo, sucking from her eyes"
30657,XXXVII,"Those sweet tears, glittering in their humid ray,"
30658,XXXVII,"And that sweet moan, from lips more deeply dyed"
30659,XXXVII,"Than crimson rose, himself in tears, replied."
30660,XXXVII,
30661,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
30662,XXXVIII,"""Alack!  my dearest life!  take thou no dread,"
30663,XXXVIII,Alack!  for love of Heaven!  of thing so light:
30664,XXXVIII,"For if (to my sole harm) with banners spread,"
30665,XXXVIII,Their following of the Frank or paynim rite
30666,XXXVIII,"King Agramant and Charles united led,"
30667,XXXVIII,This need not cause you matter for affright.
30668,XXXVIII,What poor account you make of me is clear
30669,XXXVIII,"If this one, sole, Rogero breeds such fear."
30670,XXXVIII,
30671,XXXIX,XXXIX
30672,XXXIX,"""And yet should you remember how alone"
30673,XXXIX,(Nor had I scimetar or sword in hand)
30674,XXXIX,"Of knights, with a spear's truncheon overthrown,"
30675,XXXIX,"I singly cleared the field, an armed band."
30676,XXXIX,"Though to his shame and sorrow this he own,"
30677,XXXIX,"Gradasso tells to them who make demand,"
30678,XXXIX,He was my prisoner in the Syrian tower:
30679,XXXIX,Yet other than Rogero's is his power.
30680,XXXIX,
30681,XL,XL
30682,XL,"""Not King Gradasso will the truth deny:"
30683,XL,Sacripant knows it and your Isolier:
30684,XL,"I say King Sacripant of Circassy,"
30685,XL,"And Aquilant, and Gryphon, famous peer;"
30686,XL,With hundreds -- yea and more -- from far and nigh
30687,XL,"Made prisoners at that fearful pass whilere,"
30688,XL,Baptized or Infidel; and all by me
30689,XL,From prison on the selfsame day set free.
30690,XL,
30691,XLI,XLI
30692,XLI,"""And even yet they marvel evermore"
30693,XLI,At the great feat which I performed that day;
30694,XLI,Greater than if the squadrons of the Moor
30695,XLI,And Frank united I had held at bay;
30696,XLI,"And shall Rogero, new to martial lore,"
30697,XLI,"Me, onto to one, with scathe or scorn appay?"
30698,XLI,"And me shall now this young Rogero scare,"
30699,XLI,When Hector's sword and Hector's arms I wear?

30701,XLII,XLII
30702,XLII,"""Ah!  as I might have won you from my foe,"
30703,XLII,Why did I not for you in arms contend?
30704,XLII,"I so had them my valour shown, I know,"
30705,XLII,You would have well foreseen Rogero's end.
30706,XLII,"For heaven's sake dry your tears, nor by such woe"
30707,XLII,-- An evil omen for my arms -- offend;
30708,XLII,"And learn, 'tis Honour pricks me to the field,"
30709,XLII,"And not an argent bird and blazoned shield."""
30710,XLII,
30711,XLIII,XLIII
30712,XLIII,So said he; and with reasons passing good
30713,XLIII,"To him that dame replied, with saddest face;"
30714,XLIII,"Nor only would have changed his sullen mood,"
30715,XLIII,But would have moved a pillar from its place.
30716,XLIII,"She would the champion quickly have subdued,"
30717,XLIII,"Though she was gowned, he locked in iron case;"
30718,XLIII,"And make him satisfy the Moorish lord,"
30719,XLIII,If Agramant spake further of accord;
30720,XLIII,
30721,XLIV,XLIV
30722,XLIV,And had; but that Aurora -- on his way
30723,XLIV,"Ushering aye the sun -- no sooner stirred,"
30724,XLIV,"Than young Rogero, anxious to display"
30725,XLIV,"That rightfully he bore Jove's beauteous bird,"
30726,XLIV,"To cut the quarrel short, and lest delay"
30727,XLIV,"Be further interposed, in act or word,"
30728,XLIV,"Where round the palisade the people close,"
30729,XLIV,Appears in armour and his bugle blows.
30730,XLIV,
30731,XLV,XLV
30732,XLV,"When that loud sound is by the Tartar heard,"
30733,XLV,"Which the proud warrior to the strife defies,"
30734,XLV,No more of treaty will he hear a word:
30735,XLV,"From bed upspringing, ""Arms,"" the monarch cries,"
30736,XLV,"And shows a visage with such fury stirred,"
30737,XLV,"Doralice dares no longer peace advise,"
30738,XLV,Nor speak of treaty or of truce anew;
30739,XLV,And now parforce the battle must ensue.
30740,XLV,
30741,XLVI,XLVI
30742,XLVI,The Tartar arms himself in haste; with pain
30743,XLVI,The wonted service of his squires he tarries:
30744,XLVI,"This done, he springs upon the steed amain,"
30745,XLVI,Erewhile the champion's who defended Paris;
30746,XLVI,"And him with speed towards the listed plain,"
30747,XLVI,"Fixt for that fierce assay, the courser carries."
30748,XLVI,"Even then the king and barons thither made,"
30749,XLVI,So that the strife was little time delaid.
30750,XLVI,
30751,XLVII,XLVII
30752,XLVII,"Put on and laced the shining helmets were,"
30753,XLVII,And given to either champion was the spear:
30754,XLVII,"Quickly the trumpet's blast was heard in air,"
30755,XLVII,Whose signal blanched a thousand cheeks with fear.
30756,XLVII,"Levelled those cavaliers their lances bear,"
30757,XLVII,"Spurring their warlike steeds to the career,"
30758,XLVII,"And, in mid champaign, meet with such a shock,"
30759,XLVII,That Earth appears to rive and Heaven to rock.
30760,XLVII,
30761,XLVIII,XLVIII
30762,XLVIII,"From this side and from that, the eagle flew,"
30763,XLVIII,Which Jove in air was wonted to sustain;
30764,XLVIII,"So hurtled, but with plumes of different hue,"
30765,XLVIII,Those others often on Thessalian plain.
30766,XLVIII,"The beamy lances, rested by the two,"
30767,XLVIII,"Well warranted the warriors' might and main,"
30768,XLVIII,And worse than that encounter had withstood:
30769,XLVIII,"So towers resist the wind, so rocks the flood."
30770,XLVIII,
30771,XLIX,XLIX
30772,XLIX,"As Turpin truly writes, into the sky"
30773,XLIX,"Upwent the splinters, broke in the career;"
30774,XLIX,"For two or three fell flaming from on high,"
30775,XLIX,Which had ascended to the starry sphere.
30776,XLIX,"The knights unsheathed their faulchions from the thigh,"
30777,XLIX,"And, like those who were little moved by fear,"
30778,XLIX,"For new encounter wheeled, and, man to man,"
30779,XLIX,Pointing at one another's vizor ran.
30780,XLIX,
30781,L,L
30782,L,"They, pointing at the vizors' sight, attacked,"
30783,L,"Nor with their faulchions at the steeds took aim,"
30784,L,"Each other to unhorse, unseemly act!"
30785,L,Since in that quarrel they are nought to blame.
30786,L,"Those err, nor know the usage, why by pact"
30787,L,Deem they were bound their horses not to maim:
30788,L,"Without pact made, 'twas reckoned a misdeed,"
30789,L,And an eternal blot to smite a steed.
30790,L,
30791,LI,LI
30792,LI,"They level at the vizor, which is double,"
30793,LI,And yet resists such mighty blows with pain.
30794,LI,The champions evermore their strokes redouble
30795,LI,"Faster than pattering hail, which mars the grain,"
30796,LI,"And bruises branch and leaf, and stalk and stubble,"
30797,LI,And cheats the hopes of the expecting swain.
30798,LI,"To you is known the force of either brand,"
30799,LI,And known the force of either warrior's hand.
30800,LI,
30801,LII,LII
30802,LII,But yet no stroke well worthy of their might
30803,LII,"Those peers have dealt, so cautious are the twain."
30804,LII,"The Tartar's faulchion was the first to bite,"
30805,LII,By which was good Rogero well nigh slain.
30806,LII,By one of those fell blows which either knight
30807,LII,"So well could plant, his shield was cleft in twain;"
30808,LII,"Beneath, his cuirass opened to the stroke,"
30809,LII,And to the quick the cruel weapon broke.
30810,LII,
30811,LIII,LIII
30812,LIII,"The assistants' hearts were frozen at the blow,"
30813,LIII,"So did Rogero's danger them appal,"
30814,LIII,"On whom the many's favor, well they know,"
30815,LIII,"And wishes rest, if not of one and all."
30816,LIII,"And then (had Fortune ordered matters so,"
30817,LIII,As the most part desired they should befall)
30818,LIII,Taken had been the Tartar king or slain;
30819,LIII,So had that blow offended all the train.
30820,LIII,
30821,LIV,LIV
30822,LIV,"I think that blow was by some angel stayed,"
30823,LIV,To save Rogero from the mischief near:
30824,LIV,Yet at the king (nor answer he delayed)
30825,LIV,He dealt a stroke more terrible than e'er.
30826,LIV,"As Mandricardo's head he aims his blade,"
30827,LIV,"But such the fury of the cavalier,"
30828,LIV,"And such his haste, he less my blame deserves,"
30829,LIV,If slanting from the mark his faulchion swerves.
30830,LIV,
30831,LV,LV
30832,LV,"Had Balisarda smote him full, though crowned"
30833,LV,"With Hector's helm, the enchantment had been vain."
30834,LV,"So reels the Tartar, by that stroke astound,"
30835,LV,He from the bristle-hand lets go the rein:
30836,LV,"Thrice with his head he threats to smite the ground,"
30837,LV,While his unguided courser scowers the plain;
30838,LV,"That Brigliadoro, whom by name you know,"
30839,LV,"Yet, for his change of master, full of woe."
30840,LV,
30841,LVI,LVI
30842,LVI,"Never raged trampled serpent, never so"
30843,LVI,"Raged wounded lion, as in fell despite"
30844,LVI,"Raged Mandricardo, rallying from that blow,"
30845,LVI,Which had deprived of sense the astonied knight;
30846,LVI,"And as his pride and fury waxes, grow"
30847,LVI,"As much, yea more, his valour and his might."
30848,LVI,"He at Rogero makes his courser vault,"
30849,LVI,With sword uplifted high for the assault.
30850,LVI,
30851,LVII,LVII
30852,LVII,"Poised in his stirrups stood the Tartar lord,"
30853,LVII,"And aiming at his foeman's casque, believed"
30854,LVII,He with the stroke of his descending sword
30855,LVII,Rogero to the bosom should have cleaved;
30856,LVII,"But from that youth, yet quicker in his ward,"
30857,LVII,"A wound beneath his arm the king received,"
30858,LVII,"Which made wide daylight in the stubborn mail,"
30859,LVII,That clothed the better armpit with its scale.
30860,LVII,
30861,LVIII,LVIII
30862,LVIII,"Rogero drawing Balisarda back,"
30863,LVIII,Out sprang the tepid blood of crimson stain;
30864,LVIII,"Hence Mandricardo's arm did vigour lack,"
30865,LVIII,And with less dint descended Durindane:
30866,LVIII,"Yet on the croup the stripling tumbled back,"
30867,LVIII,"Closing his eyelids, through excess of pain;"
30868,LVIII,"And memorable aye had been that blow,"
30869,LVIII,Had a worse helmet clothed the warrior's brow.
30870,LVIII,
30871,LIX,LIX
30872,LIX,"For this he pauses not, but spurs amain,"
30873,LIX,And Mandricardo smites in the right side.
30874,LIX,"Here little boots the texture of the chain,"
30875,LIX,"And the well wealded metal's temper tried,"
30876,LIX,"Against that sword, which never falls in vain,"
30877,LIX,"Which was enchanted to no end beside,"
30878,LIX,"But that against it nothing should avail,"
30879,LIX,Enchanted corselet or enchanted mail.
30880,LIX,
30881,LX,LX
30882,LX,"Whate'er that sword takes-in it shears outright,"
30883,LX,And in the Tartar's side inflicts a wound:
30884,LX,"He curses Heaven and raves in such despite,"
30885,LX,Less horribly the boisterous billows sound.
30886,LX,He now prepares to put forth all his might:
30887,LX,"The shield, with argent bird and azure ground,"
30888,LX,"He hurls, with rage transported, from his hand,"
30889,LX,And grasps with right and left his trenchant brand.

30892,LXI,"""Marry,"" (Rogero cried,) ""it needs no more"
30893,LXI,"To prove your title to that ensign vain,"

30895,LXI,"Nor can you more your right in it maintain."""
30896,LXI,"So saying, he parforce must prove how sore"
30897,LXI,The danger and the dint of Durindane;
30898,LXI,"Which smites his front, and with such weight withal,"
30899,LXI,A mountain lighter than that sword would fall.

30902,LXII,If cleft his vizor through the midst; 'twas well
30903,LXII,"That from the sight diverged the trenchant blade,"
30904,LXII,Which on the saddle's plated pommel fell;
30905,LXII,Nor yet its double steel the faulchion stayed:
30906,LXII,"It reached his armour (like soft wax, the shell"
30907,LXII,"Oped, and the skirts wherewith 'twas overlaid)"
30908,LXII,And trenched upon his thigh a grievous wound;
30909,LXII,So that 'twas long ere he again waxed sound.

30911,LXIII,LXIII
30912,LXIII,The spouting blood of either cavalier
30913,LXIII,Their arms had crimsoned in a double drain:
30914,LXIII,"Hence diversly the people guessed, which peer"
30915,LXIII,Would have the better of the warlike twain:
30916,LXIII,But soon Rogero made the matter clear
30917,LXIII,"With that keen sword, so many a champion's bane:"
30918,LXIII,With this he at that part in fury past
30919,LXIII,Whence Mandricardo had his buckler cast.
30920,LXIII,
30921,LXIV,LXIV
30922,LXIV,"He the left side of his good cuirass gored,"
30923,LXIV,And found a passage to the heart below;
30924,LXIV,Which a full palm above the flank he bored;
30925,LXIV,So that parforce the Tartar must forego
30926,LXIV,"His every title to the famous sword,"
30927,LXIV,"The blazoned buckler, and its bird of snow,"
30928,LXIV,"And yield, together with these seeds of strife,"
30929,LXIV,-- Dearer than sword and shield -- his precious life.
30930,LXIV,
30931,LXV,LXV
30932,LXV,Not unavenged the unhappy monarch dies;
30933,LXV,"For in the very moment he is smit,"
30934,LXV,"The sword -- for little period his -- he plies,"
30935,LXV,And good Rogero's vizor would have split.
30936,LXV,"But that he stopt the stroke in wary wise,"
30937,LXV,And broke its force and vigour ere it lit;
30938,LXV,"Its force and vigour broke: for he, below"
30939,LXV,"The better arm, first smote his Tartar foe."
30940,LXV,
30941,LXVI,LXVI
30942,LXVI,"Smit was the Child by Mandricardo's hand,"
30943,LXVI,At the same moment he that monarch slew:
30944,LXVI,"He, albeit thick, divides an iron band"
30945,LXVI,"And good steel cap beneath it; inches two,"
30946,LXVI,"Lies buried in the head the trenchant brand,"
30947,LXVI,The solid bone and sinew severed through.
30948,LXVI,"Astound Rogero fell, on earth reversed,"
30949,LXVI,And from his head a stream of life-blood burst.
30950,LXVI,
30951,LXVII,LXVII
30952,LXVII,"Rogero was the first who went to ground,"
30953,LXVII,"And so much longer did the king delay,"
30954,LXVII,Nigh every one of those who waited round
30955,LXVII,Weened he the prize and vaunt had borne away.
30956,LXVII,"So, erred his Doralice, that oft was drowned"
30957,LXVII,"In tears, and often clad in smiles that day:"
30958,LXVII,"She thanked her God, with hands to Heaven extended,"
30959,LXVII,That in such wise the fearful fight had ended.
30960,LXVII,
30961,LXVIII,LXVIII
30962,LXVIII,But when by tokens manifest appear
30963,LXVIII,"The live man living and the dead man slain,"

30965,LXVIII,"Some weep and some rejoice, an altered train."

30971,LXIX,LXIX
30972,LXIX,"Each with Rogero is rejoiced, and feels"
30973,LXIX,That which he utters in his heart; among

30975,LXIX,Other than what he vouches with his tongue.
30976,LXIX,"He pleasure in his countenance reveals,"
30977,LXIX,With envy at the conquest inly stung;
30978,LXIX,And -- were his destiny or chance to blame --
30979,LXIX,Curses whiche'er produced Rogero's name.
30980,LXIX,
30981,LXX,LXX
30982,LXX,What of Rogero's favour can be said?
30983,LXX,"What of caresses, many, true, and kind,"
30984,LXX,From Agramant?  that not without his aid
30985,LXX,Would have unrolled his ensigns the wind;
30986,LXX,"Who had to move from Africk been afraid,"
30987,LXX,Nor would have trusted in his host combined.
30988,LXX,"He, now King Mandricardo is no more,"
30989,LXX,Esteems him the united world before.
30990,LXX,
30991,LXXI,LXXI
30992,LXXI,Nor to Rogero lean the men alone;
30993,LXXI,"To him incline as well the female train,"
30994,LXXI,"Who for the land of France had left their own,"
30995,LXXI,Amid the troops of Africk or of Spain;
30996,LXXI,"And Doralice, herself, although she moan,"
30997,LXXI,"And for her lover, cold and pale, complain,"
30998,LXXI,"Save by the griding curb of shame represt,"
30999,LXXI,"Her voice, perchance, had added to the rest."
31000,LXXI,
31001,LXXII,LXXII
31002,LXXII,"I say perchance, nor warrant it I dare,"
31003,LXXII,Albeit the thing may easily be true;
31004,LXXII,"For such his manners, such his merits are,"
31005,LXXII,"So beauteous is Rogero's form to view,"
31006,LXXII,She (from experience we are well aware)
31007,LXXII,"So prone to follow whatsoe'er is new,"
31008,LXXII,"That not to play the widow's lovelorn part,"
31009,LXXII,She on Rogero well might set her heart.
31010,LXXII,
31011,LXXIII,LXXIII
31012,LXXIII,"Though he did well alive, what could be done"
31013,LXXIII,"With Mandricardo, after he was dead?"
31014,LXXIII,'Tis fitting she provide herself with one
31015,LXXIII,"That her, by night or day, may bravely stead."
31016,LXXIII,Meanwhile to young Rogero's succour run
31017,LXXIII,The king's physician in his art best read;
31018,LXXIII,"Who, having seen the fruits of that fell strife,"
31019,LXXIII,Already has ensured Rogero's life.
31020,LXXIII,
31021,LXXIV,LXXIV
31022,LXXIV,Agramant bids them diligently lay
31023,LXXIV,"The wounded warrior in his tent, and there"

31027,LXXIV,"So bade the Moorish king, suspended were;"
31028,LXXIV,"Suspended all, save trenchant Durindana,"

31044,LXXVI,"With tidings of her love to Alban's Mount,"
31045,LXXVI,To her Hippalca measured back her way:
31046,LXXVI,"She of Frontino first and Rodomont,"
31047,LXXVI,And next of good Rogero had to say;
31048,LXXVI,How to the fount anew he had addrest
31049,LXXVI,"His way, with Richardetto and the rest;"
31050,LXXVI,
31051,LXXVII,LXXVII
31052,LXXVII,"And how the Child, in rescue of the steed,"
31053,LXXVII,Had gone with her to find the paynim rude;
31054,LXXVII,"And weened to have chastized his foul misdeed,"
31055,LXXVII,That from a woman took Frontino good.
31056,LXXVII,"And how the youth's design did ill succeed,"
31057,LXXVII,Because the king had other way pursued.
31058,LXXVII,The reason too why to Mount Alban's hold
31059,LXXVII,"Rogero had not come, at full she told;"
31060,LXXVII,
31061,LXXVIII,LXXVIII
31062,LXXVIII,And fully she to Bradamant exprest
31063,LXXVIII,What to excuse himself Rogero said:
31064,LXXVIII,"She after drew the letter from her breast,"
31065,LXXVIII,Wherewith entrusted she had thither sped:
31066,LXXVIII,"With visage which more care than hope confest,"
31067,LXXVIII,The paper Bradamant received and read;
31068,LXXVIII,"Which, but that she expected to have seen"
31069,LXXVIII,"Rogero's self, more welcome would have been."
31070,LXXVIII,
31071,LXXIX,LXXIX
31072,LXXIX,To find herself with written scroll appaid
31073,LXXIX,"In good Rogero's place, whom she attends,"
31074,LXXIX,"Marred her fair visage; which such fear pourtrayed,"
31075,LXXIX,Despite and sorrow as her bosom rends.
31076,LXXIX,"Ten times the page she kisses, while the maid"
31077,LXXIX,As oft to him who writes her heart commends:
31078,LXXIX,The tears alone which trickle from her eyes
31079,LXXIX,Keep it from kindling at her burning sighs.
31080,LXXIX,
31081,LXXX,LXXX
31082,LXXX,"Four times, nay six, she that epistle read,"
31083,LXXX,And willed moreover that as many more

31144,LXXXVI,The appointed time parforce he overpast:
31145,LXXXVI,"On a sick bed, long time, he, sorely pained,"
31146,LXXXVI,"Was laid, wherein a month or more he past"

31151,LXXXVII,"Him on the day prefixed the maid attended,"
31152,LXXXVII,"Nor other tidings of the youth had read,"

31293,IV,
31294,V,V
31295,V,This is that cruel and envenomed wound
31296,V,Where neither salve nor portion soothes the smart;
31297,V,"Nor figure made by witch, nor murmured sound;"
31298,V,Nor star benign observed in friendly part;
31299,V,"Nor aught beside by Zoroaster found,"
31300,V,Inventor as he was of magic art.
31301,V,"Fell wound, which, more than every other woe,"
31302,V,"Makes wretched man despair, and lays him low!"
31303,V,
31304,VI,VI
31305,VI,"O' cruel wound!  incapable of cure,"
31306,VI,"Inflicted with such ease on lover's breast,"
31307,VI,No less by false suspicion than by sure!
31308,VI,"O wound!  whose pangs so wofully molest,"
31309,VI,"They reason and our better wit obscure,"
31310,VI,And from it natural bent our judgment wrest:
31311,VI,"Wound, which against all reason didst destroy"
31312,VI,The damsel of Dordona's every joy!
31313,VI,
31314,VII,VII
31315,VII,I speak not of what fatal mischief wrought
31316,VII,Hippalca's and the brother's bitter blow;
31317,VII,I speak of fell and cruel tidings brought
31318,VII,"Some few days after; for the former woe,"
31319,VII,"Weighed with this other, was a thing of nought:"
31320,VII,This after some digression will I show:
31321,VII,"But first Rinaldo's feats I must declare,"
31322,VII,Who with his troop to Paris made repair.
31323,VII,
31324,VIII,VIII
31325,VIII,"The following day they met a cavalier,"
31326,VIII,"Towards evening, with a lady by his side;"
31327,VIII,"Sable his shield, and sable was his gear,"
31328,VIII,Whose ground a bar of silver did divide.
31329,VIII,"As foremost, and of seeming force, the peer,"
31330,VIII,Young Richardetto to the joust defend:
31331,VIII,"He, prompt for battle, wheeled his courser round,"
31332,VIII,And for the tourney took sufficient ground.
31333,VIII,
31334,IX,IX
31335,IX,Between those knights no further parley past:
31336,IX,"Without more question, charged the martial two."
31337,IX,"Rinaldo with the friendly troop stood fast,"
31338,IX,And looked to see what issue would ensue.
31339,IX,"""Him from his saddle will I quickly cast,"
31340,IX,"If firm the footing, and mine arm prove true"";"
31341,IX,Within himself young Richardetto cries:
31342,IX,But that encounter ends in other wise.
31343,IX,
31344,X,X
31345,X,Him underneath the vizor's sight offends
31346,X,"The stranger champion, of the sable weed,"
31347,X,"With force so fell, that he the youth extends"
31348,X,Above two lances' length beyond his steed.
31349,X,"Quickly to venge the knight Alardo wends,"
31350,X,But falls himself astounded on the mead;
31351,X,"Sore handled, and unhorsed by such a stroke,"
31352,X,His buckler in the cruel shock is broke.
31353,X,
31354,XI,XI
31355,XI,"His lance Guichardo levelled, when he spied"
31356,XI,"Outstretched upon the field, the brethren two;"
31357,XI,"Although ""Halt, halt,"" (renowned Rinaldo cried,)"
31358,XI,"""For this third course to me is justly due"":"
31359,XI,But he as yet his helmet had not tied;
31360,XI,So that Guichardo to the combat flew.
31361,XI,He kept his seat no better than the twain;
31362,XI,"Forthwith, like them, extended on the plain."
31363,XI,
31364,XII,XII
31365,XII,"All to be foremost in the joust contend,"
31366,XII,"Richardo, Malagigi, Viviane:"
31367,XII,But to their strife Rinaldo puts an end;
31368,XII,"He shows himself in arms before the train,"
31369,XII,"Saying, "" 'Tis time that we to Paris wend;"
31370,XII,"For us too long the tourney will detain,"
31371,XII,"If I expect till each his course has run,"
31372,XII,"And ye are all unseated, one by one."""
31373,XII,
31374,XIII,XIII
31375,XIII,"So spake the knight, yet spake not in a tone"
31376,XIII,To be o'erheard in what he inly said;
31377,XIII,Who thus foul scorn would to the rest have done.
31378,XIII,"Both now had wheeled, and fierce encounter made."
31379,XIII,"In the career Rinaldo was not thrown,"
31380,XIII,Who all the banded kinsmen much outweighed;
31381,XIII,"Their spears like brittle glass to pieces went,"
31382,XIII,But not an inch the champions backward bent.
31383,XIII,
31384,XIV,XIV
31385,XIV,"The chargers such a rough encounter made,"
31386,XIV,That on his crupper sank each staggering horse:
31387,XIV,"Rinaldo's rose so quick, he might be said"
31388,XIV,Scarcely to interrupt his rapid course:
31389,XIV,The stranger's broke his spine and shoulder-blade;
31390,XIV,That other shocked him with such desperate force.
31391,XIV,"When his lord sees him slain, he leaves his seat,"
31392,XIV,And in an instant springs upon his feet;
31393,XIV,
31394,XV,XV
31395,XV,"And to his foe, that having wheeled anew,"
31396,XV,"Approached with hand unarmed, the warrior cried:"
31397,XV,"""Sir, to the goodly courser whom ye slew,"
31398,XV,"Because, whenas he lived, he was my pride,"
31399,XV,"I deem, I ill should render honour due,"
31400,XV,If thus unvenged by my good arm he died;
31401,XV,"And so fall on, and do as best ye may,"
31402,XV,"For we parforce must meet in new assay."""
31403,XV,
31404,XVI,XVI
31405,XVI,"To him Rinaldo, ""If we for thy horse"
31406,XVI,"Have to contend in fight, and nought beside,"
31407,XVI,"Take comfort, for I ween that with no worse"
31408,XVI,"Thou, in his place, by me shalt be supplied."""
31409,XVI,"-- ""Thou errest if thou deem'st his loss the source"
31410,XVI,"Of my regret"" (the stranger knight replied);"
31411,XVI,"""But I, since thou divinest not my speech,"
31412,XVI,To thee my meaning will more plainly teach.
31413,XVI,
31414,XVII,XVII
31415,XVII,"""I should esteem it were a foul misdeed,"
31416,XVII,Unless I proved thee also with the brand.
31417,XVII,"I, if thou in this other dance succeed"
31418,XVII,"Better or worse than me, would understand:"
31419,XVII,"Then, as it please, afoot or on thy steed,"
31420,XVII,"Attack me, so it be with arms in hand."
31421,XVII,I am content all vantage to afford;
31422,XVII,"Such my desire to try thee with the sword!"""
31423,XVII,
31424,XVIII,XVIII
31425,XVIII,"Not long Rinaldo paused: he cried, ""I plight"
31426,XVIII,My promise not to balk thee of the fray;
31427,XVIII,"And, for I deem thou art a valiant knight,"
31428,XVIII,"And lest thou umbrage take at mine array,"
31429,XVIII,"These shall go on before, nor other wight,"
31430,XVIII,"Beside a page, to hold my horse, shall stay."""
31431,XVIII,"So spake Mount Alban's lord; and to his band,"
31432,XVIII,To wend their way the warrior gave command.
31433,XVIII,
31434,XIX,XIX
31435,XIX,To that king paladin with praise replied
31436,XIX,"The stranger peer; alighting on the plain,"
31437,XIX,"Rinaldo to the valet, at his side,"
31438,XIX,"Consigned the goodly steed Baiardo's rein,"
31439,XIX,"And when his banner he no longer spied,"
31440,XIX,"Now widely distant with the warrior's train,"
31441,XIX,"His buckler braced, his biting faulchion drew,"
31442,XIX,And to the field defied the knight anew.
31443,XIX,
31444,XX,XX
31445,XX,And now each other they in fight assail:
31446,XX,Was never seen a feller strife in show.
31447,XX,"Neither believes his foeman can avail,"
31448,XX,"Long, in that fierce debate, against his blow:"
31449,XX,"But when they knew, well neighed in doubtful scale,"
31450,XX,"That they were fitly matched, for weal or woe,"
31451,XX,"They laid their fury and their pride apart,"
31452,XX,And for their vantage practised every art.
31453,XX,
31454,XXI,XXI
31455,XXI,"Their cruel and despiteous blows resound,"
31456,XXI,"Re-echoing wide, what time the valiant twain"
31457,XXI,"With cantlets of their shields now strew the ground,"
31458,XXI,Now with their faulchions sever plate and chain.
31459,XXI,"Yet more behoves to parry than to wound,"
31460,XXI,If either knight his footing would maintain;
31461,XXI,"For the first fault in fence, by either made,"
31462,XXI,Will with eternal mischief be appaid.
31463,XXI,
31464,XXII,XXII
31465,XXII,"One hour and more than half another, stood"
31466,XXII,The knights in battle; and the golden sun
31467,XXII,"Already was beneath the tumbling flood,"
31468,XXII,And the horizon veiled with darkness dun:
31469,XXII,"Nor yet had they reposed, nor interlude"
31470,XXII,"Had been, since that despiteous fight begun,"
31471,XXII,"'Twixt these, whom neither ire nor rancour warms,"
31472,XXII,But simple thirst of fame excites to arms.
31473,XXII,
31474,XXIII,XXIII
31475,XXIII,Rinaldo in himself revolving weighed
31476,XXIII,"Who was the stranger knight, so passing stout;"
31477,XXIII,"That not alone him bravely had gainsaid,"
31478,XXIII,But oft endangered in that deadly bout;
31479,XXIII,"And has so harassed with his furious blade,"
31480,XXIII,He of its final issue stands in doubt.
31481,XXIII,"-- He that the strife was ended would be fain,"
31482,XXIII,So that his knightly honour took no stain.
31483,XXIII,
31484,XXIV,XXIV
31485,XXIV,"The stranger knight, upon the other side,"
31486,XXIV,As little of his valiant foeman knew;
31487,XXIV,"Nor in that lord Mount Alban's chief descried,"
31488,XXIV,In warfare so renowned all countries through.
31489,XXIV,"And upon whom, with such small cause defied,"
31490,XXIV,His faulchion he in deadly combat drew.
31491,XXIV,He was assured he could not have in fight
31492,XXIV,Experience of a more redoubted wight.
31493,XXIV,
31494,XXV,XXV
31495,XXV,He gladly would be quit of the emprize
31496,XXV,He undertook to venge his courser's fall;
31497,XXV,"And, could he, without blame, a mean devise,"
31498,XXV,Would fain withdraw from that disastrous brawl.
31499,XXV,"So overcast already were the skies,"
31500,XXV,Their cruel strokes well nigh fell harmless all.
31501,XXV,Both blindly strike; more blindly yet those lords
31502,XXV,"Parry the stroke, who scarce discern their swords."
31503,XXV,
31504,XXVI,XXVI
31505,XXVI,"He of Mount Alban is the first to say,"
31506,XXVI,"They should not combat darkling, on the plain;"
31507,XXVI,But should their duel till such time delay
31508,XXVI,As slow Arcturus should have turned his wain.
31509,XXVI,"(And adds,) as safely as himself might stay"
31510,XXVI,"The foe in his pavilion, of his train"
31511,XXVI,"As duly tended, honoured, and well seen,"
31512,XXVI,As he in any place had ever been.
31513,XXVI,
31514,XXVII,XXVII
31515,XXVII,To pray him has Rinaldo little need:
31516,XXVII,He courteously accepts him for his host;
31517,XXVII,"And thither the united warriors speed,"
31518,XXVII,Where lies Mount Alban's troop in chosen post.
31519,XXVII,"From his attendant squire a goodly steed,"
31520,XXVII,"With sumptuous housings gorgeously embossed,"
31521,XXVII,"Rinaldo takes, with tempered sword and spear,"
31522,XXVII,And these bestows upon the cavalier.
31523,XXVII,
31524,XXVIII,XXVIII
31525,XXVIII,"For Montalbano's lord the stranger guest,"
31526,XXVIII,"The baron recognised, with whom he came;"
31527,XXVIII,"Because, before they reached their place of rest,"
31528,XXVIII,The paladin had chanced himself to name;
31529,XXVIII,"And (for they brethren were) with love opprest,"
31530,XXVIII,His tenderness him wholly overcame;
31531,XXVIII,"And touched with kind affection, at his heart,"
31532,XXVIII,From his full eyes the tears of pleasure start.
31533,XXVIII,
31534,XXIX,XXIX
31535,XXIX,"Guido the savage was that cavalier,"
31536,XXIX,"Who, with Marphisa leagued, the martial maid,"
31537,XXIX,"Sansonet, and the sons of Olivier,"
31538,XXIX,"Long sailed the sea, as I erewhile have said;"
31539,XXIX,From earlier meeting with his kindred dear
31540,XXIX,"By Pinnabel, the felon knight, delaid;"
31541,XXIX,"Seized by that traitor, and by him detained,"
31542,XXIX,To enforce the wicked law he had ordained.
31543,XXIX,
31544,XXX,XXX
31545,XXX,"Sir Guido, when he knew his host to be"
31546,XXX,"Rinaldo, famed above each famous knight,"
31547,XXX,Whom he had burned with more desire to see
31548,XXX,"Than ever blindman covets the lost light,"
31549,XXX,"In rapture cries, ""What fortune tempted me"
31550,XXX,"With you, my lord, to strive in deadly fight,"
31551,XXX,"Whom long I have beloved, and love, whose worth"
31552,XXX,I prize above all dwellers' upon earth?

31555,XXXI,"""Me on the distant bank of Euxine's flood"
31556,XXXI,"(I Guido am yclept) Constantia bare,"
31557,XXXI,Conceived of the illustrious seed and good
31558,XXXI,"Of generous Aymon, as ye likewise are."
31559,XXXI,To visit you and my bold brotherhood
31560,XXXI,"Is the occasion, hither I repair;"
31561,XXXI,"And, where to honour you I had in thought,"
31562,XXXI,I see my coming has but mischief wrought.
31563,XXXI,
31564,XXXII,XXXII
31565,XXXII,"""But that I neither ye nor the others knew,"
31566,XXXII,Must for so foul a fault be my excuse;
31567,XXXII,"And, if I can amend it, bid me do"
31568,XXXII,"Whate'er thou wilt, nor ought will I refuse."""
31569,XXXII,"When, on this part and that, between the two,"
31570,XXXII,"Of interchanged embraces there was truce,"
31571,XXXII,"""Take you no farther thought upon your side"
31572,XXXII,"The battle to excuse,"" Rinaldo cried."
31573,XXXII,
31574,XXXIII,XXXIII
31575,XXXIII,"""For in complete assurance that you are"
31576,XXXIII,"A real offset of our ancient tree,"
31577,XXXIII,You could no better testimony bear
31578,XXXIII,Than the tried valour which in you we see;
31579,XXXIII,"If your demeanour more pacific were,"
31580,XXXIII,We ill should have believed your ancestry:
31581,XXXIII,"Since neither lion from the doe proceeds,"
31582,XXXIII,"Nor fearful pigeon, hawk or eagle breeds."""
31583,XXXIII,
31584,XXXIV,XXXIV
31585,XXXIV,"While neither they through talk their journey stay,"
31586,XXXIV,"Neither through speed abate their talk, those two"
31587,XXXIV,Reached the pavilions where the kinsmen lay:
31588,XXXIV,"There good Rinaldo, crying to his crew"
31589,XXXIV,"That this was Guido, whom so many a day"
31590,XXXIV,"They had impatiently desired to view,"
31591,XXXIV,"Much pleased the friendly troop; and, at his sight"
31592,XXXIV,All like his father deemed the stranger knight.
31593,XXXIV,
31594,XXXV,XXXV
31595,XXXV,I will not tell what welcome to the peer
31596,XXXV,"Made Richardet, Alardo, and those twain;"
31597,XXXV,"What Malagigi, what Sir Aldigier,"
31598,XXXV,"And gallant Vivian, of that kindred train;"
31599,XXXV,"What every captain, every cavalier;"
31600,XXXV,"What Guido spake, what they replied again:"
31601,XXXV,"I for conclusion of my tale will say,"
31602,XXXV,He was well greeted of the whole array.
31603,XXXV,
31604,XXXVI,XXXVI
31605,XXXVI,"Ever, I deem, good Guido would have been"
31606,XXXVI,Dear to his brethren bold; but welcomed more
31607,XXXVI,"Was now the valiant knight, and better seen"
31608,XXXVI,"That at another time, as needed sore."
31609,XXXVI,"When the sun, garlanded with radiance sheen,"
31610,XXXVI,"Upraised his visage from the watery floor,"
31611,XXXVI,"Sir Guido and his kinsmen, in a band,"
31612,XXXVI,Beneath Rinaldo's banner took their stand.
31613,XXXVI,
31614,XXXVI,XXXVI
31615,XXXVI,"So one day and another prick the train,"
31616,XXXVI,"That they to Paris' leaguered gates are nigh,"
31617,XXXVI,"Scarce ten miles distant, on the banks of Seine;"
31618,XXXVI,"When, as good Fortune wills it, they descry"
31619,XXXVI,"Gryphon and Aquilant, the two that stain"
31620,XXXVI,Their virtuous armour with a different dye;

31628,XXXVIII,The vesture edged about with list of gold:
31629,XXXVIII,"Graceful and fair; although she was dismaid,"
31630,XXXVIII,And down her visage tears of sorrow rolled;
31631,XXXVIII,"Who with such mien and act her speech enforced,"
31632,XXXVIII,It seemed of some high matter she discoursed.
31633,XXXVIII,
31634,XXXIX,XXXIX
31635,XXXIX,"As Guido them, they gallant Guido knew."
31636,XXXIX,He with the pair had been few days before;

31639,XXXIX,"And if they join your banner, against you"
31640,XXXIX,"Feebly will stand the squadrons of the Moor."""
31641,XXXIX,"Rinaldo vouched what valiant Guido told,"
31642,XXXIX,How either champion was a warrior bold.
31643,XXXIX,
31644,XL,XL
31645,XL,Nor them he less had recognized at sight;

31647,XL,"One by a vest all black, and one all white,"
31648,XL,"He knows, and by the ornaments they wear."
31649,XL,"The brethren know as well Mount Alban's knight,"

31874,LXIII,LXIII
31875,LXIII,She tells him how the perilous bridge's floor
31876,LXIII,From cavaliers king Rodomont defends;
31877,LXIII,"Where, on a pompous sepulchre, the Moor"
31878,LXIII,His prisoners' ravished arms and vest suspends;

31909,LXVI,"Light from thine horse and doff thy warlike gear,"
31910,LXVI,"To deck this sepulchre, ere thee I slay,"

31920,LXVII,With any warrior in the world had weighed.
31921,LXVII,"King Rodomont as well, with rested spear,"

31939,LXIX,Nor much their mighty strength or manege-lore
31940,LXIX,"Avails the steeds; for, prostrate in the dust,"

31945,LXX,"When either steed would nimbly spring from ground,"
31946,LXX,"As the spur galled and gored his bleeding flank,"
31947,LXX,He on that little bridge no footing found;
31948,LXX,For all to narrow was the scanty plank.
31949,LXX,"Hence both fall headlong, and the deafening sound"
31950,LXX,Re-echo vaulted skies and grassy bank.
31951,LXX,"So rang our stream, when from the heavenly sphere"

31953,LXX,
31954,LXXI,LXXI
31955,LXXI,"With all their weight, down hurtled from the steep,"
31956,LXXI,"Coursers and cavaliers, who sate them well;"

31958,LXXI,To search for beauteous nymph in secret cell.
31959,LXXI,Nor this the first nor yet the second leap
31960,LXXI,Which from the bridge had made that infidel!
31961,LXXI,"Who, often floundering in its oozy bed,"
31962,LXXI,Well in the soundings of that stream was read.

31964,LXXII,LXXII
31965,LXXII,"He where 'tis hand and where 'tis softer knows,"
31966,LXXII,"Where shallow is the water, where profound:"

31968,LXXII,And Brandimart assailed on safer ground.
31969,LXXII,"Brandimart, whirling with the current, goes,"
31970,LXXII,While his steed's feet the faithless bottom pound.
31971,LXXII,"He, with his lord, stands rooted in the mud,"
31972,LXXII,With risk to both of drowning in the flood.
31973,LXXII,
31974,LXXIII,LXXIII
31975,LXXIII,"Whelming them upside-down, the waters flow,"

31998,LXXV,"But Rodomont a while his help delayed,"
31999,LXXV,And seized the warrior's sword and helmet first.
32000,LXXV,"Him half exhausted from the stream he drew,"
32001,LXXV,And prisoned with that other captive crew.

32007,LXXVI,Than to behold him perish in the tide.
32008,LXXVI,"None but herself she blames for the event,"
32009,LXXVI,"Who thitherward had been the champion's guide,"
32010,LXXVI,"She having to that faithful warrior shown,"

32017,LXXVII,Or other cavalier of Pepin's court;
32018,LXXVII,"Some warrior good by water and by land,"
32019,LXXVII,That with the Saracen will well assort.
32020,LXXVII,"Who, if no stronger than her baffled knight,"
32021,LXXVII,With better fortune may maintain the fight.

32023,LXXVIII,LXXVIII
32024,LXXVIII,"For many days the damsel vainly strayed,"
32025,LXXVIII,Ere she encountered any one who bore
32026,LXXVIII,"Semblance of knight, that might afford her aid,"
32027,LXXVIII,And free her prisoned lover from the Moor;
32028,LXXVIII,"After she long and fruitless search had made,"
32029,LXXVIII,"At length a warrior crost her way, that wore"
32030,LXXVIII,"A richly ornamented vest, whose ground"
32031,LXXVIII,With trunks of cypresses was broidered round.

32033,LXXIX,LXXIX
32034,LXXIX,"Who was that champion, shall be said elsewhere;"

32036,LXXIX,How Malagigi and Rinaldo are
32037,LXXIX,Victorious o'er the routed Moorish foe.
32038,LXXIX,"To count the flyers were a useless care,"
32039,LXXIX,Or many drowned in Stygian streams below.
32040,LXXIX,"The darkness rendered Turpin's labour vain,"

32069,LXXXII,"And such a troop, he seeks to make a stand,"
32070,LXXXII,He and his friends in that disastrous strife

32105,LXXXVI,A part in the alarum of that night:
32106,LXXXVI,"Not that he stained the mead with paynim gore,"
32107,LXXXVI,"Nor splintered heads; but that the wizard wight,"
32108,LXXXVI,"Infernal angels, by his magic lore,"
32109,LXXXVI,Called from Tartarean caverns into light;
32110,LXXXVI,Whose many spears and banners waving wide
32111,LXXXVI,Two kingdoms such as France had scarce supplied.
32112,LXXXVI,
32113,LXXXVII,LXXXVII
32114,LXXXVII,"And with them such sonorous metal brayed,"
32115,LXXXVII,So many drums and martial noises sounded;
32116,LXXXVII,So many steeds in that encounter neighed;
32117,LXXXVII,So many cries -- with rush of foot confounded --
32118,LXXXVII,"Rose all about, that hill, dale, wood, and glade,"
32119,LXXXVII,"From distant parts, the deafening din rebounded;"
32120,LXXXVII,"And struck into the Moors such sudden dread,"
32121,LXXXVII,They turned and from the field in panic fled.
32122,LXXXVII,
32123,LXXXVIII,LXXXVIII
32124,LXXXVIII,"Their king forgets no, how Rogero lay"
32125,LXXXVIII,"Sore wounded, and as yet in evil case."
32126,LXXXVIII,"Him, with what care they could, he made convey"
32127,LXXXVIII,"From that dread field, on horse of easy pace."
32128,LXXXVIII,"Borne to the sea by the securest way,"
32129,LXXXVIII,"They in a bark the suffering warrior place,"
32130,LXXXVIII,And thence commodiously to Arles transport;
32131,LXXXVIII,Whither their wasted squadrons make resort.

32139,LXXXIX,With crimson what before was white and green.
32140,LXXXIX,"Not so Gradasso's puissant troops was spent,"

32144,XC,Nay; when he hears it is Mount Alban's knight
32145,XC,"By whom assailed the paynim quarters are,"
32146,XC,"He in his heart exults, with such delight,"
32147,XC,"That he, for very joy, leaps here and there."
32148,XC,"He thanks and lauds his God, who him that night"
32149,XC,Blest with so high a fortune and so rare;
32150,XC,"Hoping to win the horse without a peer,"
32151,XC,"Baiardo, from the Christian cavalier."
32152,XC,
32153,XCI,XCI
32154,XCI,Gradasso had desired long time before
32155,XCI,(I think you will have read the tale elsewhere)
32156,XCI,"To back that courser, which Rinaldo bore,"
32157,XCI,And Durindana by his side to wear:
32158,XCI,He with a hundred thousand men and more
32159,XCI,"To France, with this design, had made repair;"
32160,XCI,"And had erewhile to bloody fight defied,"

32163,XCII,XCII
32164,XCII,"Hence had that king repaired to the sea-shore,"
32165,XCII,The place assigned to end their discord fell:
32166,XCII,But all was marred by Malagigi's lore;
32167,XCII,"Who, cheating good Rinaldo with a spell,"
32168,XCII,To sea the champion in a pinnace bore.
32169,XCII,Too tedious were the tale at length to tell.
32170,XCII,"Hence evermore Gradasso had opined,"
32171,XCII,The gentle baron was of craven kind.
32172,XCII,
32173,XCIII,XCIII
32174,XCIII,Now that Gradasso learns Mount Alban's peer
32175,XCIII,"Is he, that storms the camp, in huge delight,"
32176,XCIII,"Armed, on Alfana leaps the cavalier,"
32177,XCIII,"And through the pitchy darkness seeks the knight,"
32178,XCIII,"O'erturning all who cross his fierce career,"
32179,XCIII,He leaves afflicted and in piteous plight
32180,XCIII,The broken bands of Afric and of France.
32181,XCIII,"All, food alike for his wide-wasting lance."
32182,XCIII,
32183,XCIV,XCIV
32184,XCIV,"He seeks the paladin, now here now there,"
32185,XCIV,Echoing his name as loud as he can shout;

32187,XCIV,The bodies are most thickly strown about.
32188,XCIV,"At length encounter, sword to sword, the pair,"
32189,XCIV,For broken are alike their lances stout;
32190,XCIV,"Which shivering in their hands, had flown upright."

32194,XCV,"When King Gradasso recognized the foe,"
32195,XCV,"Not by the blazoned bearing of his shield,"

32197,XCV,"Which made him seem sole champion of the field,"
32198,XCV,"He to reproach the knight was nothing slow,"
32199,XCV,And of unworthy action him appealed;
32200,XCV,"In that he had not kept his ground and day,"

32694,XXXIII,"As if alone to see Rogero brought,"
32695,XXXIII,"Had to the camp returned, uncalled, unsought."
32696,XXXIII,
32697,XXXIV,XXXIV
32698,XXXIV,"She solely to the camp had ta'en her way,"
32699,XXXIV,To visit him that on a sick-bed smarted;
32700,XXXIV,Nor once alone; but often all the day
32701,XXXIV,"There passed that maid, and but at eve departed:"
32702,XXXIV,"Who gave yet greater cause of her to say,"
32703,XXXIV,"That -- known as one so haughty and hard-hearted,"
32704,XXXIV,Who all the world despised -- she now was grown
32705,XXXIV,Benign and humble to the Child alone.

32711,XXXV,From falling she preserved herself with pain.
32712,XXXV,"She turned her courser round, without a word,"
32713,XXXV,Inflamed with jealousy and fierce disdain:
32714,XXXV,"From her all hope the wretched damsel spurns,"
32715,XXXV,And to her chamber breathing wrath returns.

32723,XXXVI,"To such a pitcher her smothered anguish grows,"
32724,XXXVI,"Her plaints no longer able to restrain,"

32731,XXXVII,That I so pious and so faithful deemed.
32732,XXXVII,"What foul and felon act, what treachery,"
32733,XXXVII,"Was ever yet by tragic poet dreamed,"

32741,XXXVIII,"And none with thee in gentleness compete,"

32983,LXII,-- She musing on Rogero -- wends his way.

33002,LXIV,"To him where, well or ill, she might be housed,"
33003,LXIV,-- With many instances the maid applied --
33004,LXIV,"For never house could such ill shelter yield,"

33021,LXVI,To joust with all new comers makes him swear:
33022,LXVI,"If none, he need not move; but arms and fight"
33023,LXVI,He must what stranger thither shall repair;
33024,LXVI,"And he that worst his warlike arms shall ply,"

33032,LXVII,"So, if one only in that mansion stay,"
33033,LXVII,"He with those two, or more, a lance must break."
33034,LXVII,Then with as many others as succeed:

33042,LXVIII,Bradamant asked the kindly shepherd where
33043,LXVIII,That castle stood; and he with signs replied
33044,LXVIII,"As well as words, and pointed with his hand"
33045,LXVIII,"Where, five or six miles wide, the tower did stand."

33072,LXXI,"And now fast fell the rain; yet, forced to seize"
33073,LXXI,"Their arms, they slowly don the martial mail."
33074,LXXI,The rest remain within; while they proceed
33075,LXXI,"Against the damsel, but with little speed."

33077,LXXII,LXXII
33078,LXXII,"Three cavaliers they were, of might so tried,"
33079,LXXII,"Few champions but to them in prowess yield,"

33081,LXXII,"The courier maid, encountered in the field,"
33082,LXXII,"They that in Iceland boasted, in their pride,"

33172,LXXXI,"And he, that castle's master, plainly read,"
33173,LXXXI,(Who often had beheld her face before)
33174,LXXXI,That this was Bradamant; and now he paid
33175,LXXXI,Yet higher honours to the martial maid.

33183,LXXXII,(Bradamant asks the courteous cavalier)
33184,LXXXII,"By whom begun, and how it took its rise?"

34128,LXV,"Her thanks first rendered to the courteous lord,"
34129,LXV,For his kind of cheer and hospitable board.
34130,LXV,
34131,LXVI,LXVI
34132,LXVI,"And found, the lady messenger, with maid"
34133,LXVI,"And squire, had issued from the castled hold,"
34134,LXVI,"And was a-field, where her arrival stayed"
34135,LXVI,"Those three good warriors, those the damsel bold"
34136,LXVI,"The eve before had on the champaign laid,"
34137,LXVI,Cast from their horses by her lance of gold;
34138,LXVI,"And who had suffered, to their mighty pain,"
34139,LXVI,"All night, the freezing wind and pattering rain."
34140,LXVI,
34141,LXVII,LXVII
34142,LXVII,"Add to such ill, that, hungering sore for food,"
34143,LXVII,"They and their horses, through the livelong night,"
34144,LXVII,"Trampling the mire, with chattering teeth, had stood:"
34145,LXVII,But (what well-nigh engendered more despite
34146,LXVII,-- Say not well nigh -- more moved the warrior's mood)
34147,LXVII,Was that they knew the damsel would recite
34148,LXVII,How they had been unhorsed by hostile lance
34149,LXVII,In the first course which they had run in France;
34150,LXVII,
34151,LXVIII,LXVIII
34152,LXVIII,And -- each resolved to die or else his name
34153,LXVIII,Forthwith in new encounter to retrieve --
34154,LXVIII,"That Ulany, the message-bearing dame,"
34155,LXVIII,"(Whose style no longer I unmentioned leave),"
34156,LXVIII,A fairer notion of their knightly fame
34157,LXVIII,"Than heretofore, might haply now conceive,"
34158,LXVIII,"Bold Bradamant anew to fight defied,"
34159,LXVIII,When of the drawbridge clear they her descried;
34160,LXVIII,
34161,LXIX,LXIX
34162,LXIX,"Not thinking, howsoe'er, she was a maid,"
34163,LXIX,Who in no look or act the maid confest;
34164,LXIX,"Duke Aymon's daughter, loth to be delaid,"
34165,LXIX,"Refuses, as a traveller that is pressed."
34166,LXIX,"But they so often and so sorely prayed,"
34167,LXIX,That she could ill refuse the kings' request.
34168,LXIX,"Her lance she levels, at three strokes extends"
34169,LXIX,"All three on earth, and thus the warfare ends:"
34170,LXIX,
34171,LXX,LXX
34172,LXX,"For Bradamant no more her courser wheeled,"
34173,LXX,But turned her back upon the foes o'erthrown.
34174,LXX,"They, that intent to gain the golden shield,"
34175,LXX,"Had sought a land so distant from their own,"
34176,LXX,Rising in sullen silence from the field
34177,LXX,(For speech with all their hardihood was gone)
34178,LXX,"Appeared as stupefied by their surprise,"
34179,LXX,Nor to Ulania dared to lift their eyes.
34180,LXX,
34181,LXXI,LXXI
34182,LXXI,"For they, as thither they their course addrest,"
34183,LXXI,"Had vaunted to the maid in boasting vein,"
34184,LXXI,"No paladin or knight with lance in rest,"
34185,LXXI,Against the worst his saddle could maintain.
34186,LXXI,"To make them vail yet more their haughty crest,"
34187,LXXI,"And look upon the world with less disdain,"
34188,LXXI,"She tells them, by no paladin or peer"
34189,LXXI,"Were they unhorsed, but by a woman's spear."
34190,LXXI,
34191,LXXII,LXXII
34192,LXXII,"""Now what of Roland's and Rinaldo's might,"
34193,LXXII,"Not without reason held in such renown,"
34194,LXXII,Ought you to think (she said) when thus in fight
34195,LXXII,Ye by a female hand are overthrown?
34196,LXXII,"Say, if the buckler one of these requite,"
34197,LXXII,"-- Better than by a woman ye have done,"
34198,LXXII,Will ye by those redoubted warriors do?
34199,LXXII,"So think not I, nor haply think so you."
34200,LXXII,
34201,LXXIII,LXXIII
34202,LXXIII,"""This may suffice you all; and need in none"
34203,LXXIII,A clearer proof of prowess to display;
34204,LXXIII,"And who desires, if rashly any one"
34205,LXXIII,"Desires, again his valour to assay,"
34206,LXXIII,"Would add but scathe to shame, now made his own;"
34207,LXXIII,Now; and the same to-day as yesterday.
34208,LXXIII,"Unless perchance he thinks it praise and gain,"
34209,LXXIII,"By such illustrious warriors to be slain."""
34210,LXXIII,
34211,LXXIV,LXXIV
34212,LXXIV,When they by Ulany were certified
34213,LXXIV,"A woman's hand had caused their overthrow,"
34214,LXXIV,Who with a deeper black than pitch had dyed
34215,LXXIV,"Their honour, heretofore so fair of show;"
34216,LXXIV,"And more than ten her story testified,"
34217,LXXIV,Where one sufficed -- with such o'erwhelming woe
34218,LXXIV,"Were they possest, they with such fury burned,"
34219,LXXIV,They well nigh on themselves their weapons turned.
34220,LXXIV,
34221,LXXV,LXXV
34222,LXXV,"What arms they had upon them, they unbound,"
34223,LXXV,"And cast them, strung by rage and fury sore,"
34224,LXXV,"Into the moat which girt that castle round,"
34225,LXXV,Nor even kept the faulchions which they wore;
34226,LXXV,"And, since a woman them had cast to ground,"
34227,LXXV,"O'erwhelmed with rage and shame, the warriors swore,"
34228,LXXV,"Themselves of such a crying shame to clear,"
34229,LXXV,"They, without bearing arms, would pass a year;"
34230,LXXV,
34231,LXXVI,LXXVI
34232,LXXVI,And that they evermore afoot would fare
34233,LXXVI,"Up hill or down, by mountain or by plain,"
34234,LXXVI,"Nor, when the year was ended, would they wear"
34235,LXXVI,The knightly mail or climb the steed again;
34236,LXXVI,"Save that from other they by force should bear,"
34237,LXXVI,"In battle, other steeds and other chain."
34238,LXXVI,"So, without arms, to punish their misdeeds,"
34239,LXXVI,"These wend a-foot, those others on their steeds."
34240,LXXVI,
34241,LXXVII,LXXVII
34242,LXXVII,"Lodged in a township at the fall of night,"
34243,LXXVII,"Duke Aymon's daughter, journeying Paris-ward,"
34244,LXXVII,Hears how King Agramant was foiled in fight.
34245,LXXVII,"Good harbourage withal of bed and board,"
34246,LXXVII,She in her hostel found; but small delight
34247,LXXVII,This and all comforts else to her afford.
34248,LXXVII,"For the sad damsel meat and sleep foregoes,"
34249,LXXVII,Nor finds a resting place; far less repose.
34250,LXXVII,
34251,LXXVIII,LXXVIII
34252,LXXVIII,"But so I will not on her story dwell,"
34253,LXXVIII,As not to seek anew the valiant twain;
34254,LXXVIII,"Who, by consent, beside a lonely well,"
34255,LXXVIII,Had tied their goodly coursers by the rein.
34256,LXXVIII,"I of their war to you somedeal will tell,"
34257,LXXVIII,"A war not waged for empire or domain,"
34258,LXXVIII,But that the best should buckle to his side
34259,LXXVIII,"Good Durindana, and Baiardo ride."
34260,LXXVIII,
34261,LXXIX,LXXIX
34262,LXXIX,"No signal they, no trumpet they attend,"
34263,LXXIX,"To blow them to the lists, no master who"
34264,LXXIX,"Should teach them when to foin and when to fend,"
34265,LXXIX,Or wake their sleeping wrath; their swords they drew:
34266,LXXIX,"Then, one against the other, boldly wend,"
34267,LXXIX,"With lifted blades, the quick and dextrous two."
34268,LXXIX,"Already 'gan the champions' fury heat,"
34269,LXXIX,And fast and hard their swords were heard to beat.
34270,LXXIX,
34271,LXXX,LXXX
34272,LXXX,None e'er by proof two other faulchions chose
34273,LXXX,"For sound and solid, able to endure"
34274,LXXX,"Three strokes alone of such conflicting foes,"
34275,LXXX,"Passing all means and measure; but so pure,"
34276,LXXX,"So perfect was their temper, from all blows"
34277,LXXX,"By such repeated trial so secure,"
34278,LXXX,"They in a thousand strokes might clash on high,"
34279,LXXX,"-- Nay more, nor yet the solid metal fly."
34280,LXXX,
34281,LXXXI,LXXXI
34282,LXXXI,"With mickle industry, with mighty pain"
34283,LXXXI,"And art, Rinaldo, shifting here and there,"
34284,LXXXI,"Avoids the deadly dint of Durindane,"
34285,LXXXI,Well knowing how 'tis wont to cleave and tear.
34286,LXXXI,"Gradasso struck with greater might and main,"
34287,LXXXI,But well nigh all his strokes were spent in air;
34288,LXXXI,"Of, if he sometimes smote, he smote on part,"
34289,LXXXI,Where Durindana wrought less harm than smart.
34290,LXXXI,
34291,LXXXII,LXXXII
34292,LXXXII,"Rinaldo with more skill his blade inclined,"
34293,LXXXII,And stunned the arm of Sericana's lord.
34294,LXXXII,"Him oft he reached where casque and coat confined,"
34295,LXXXII,And often raked his haunches with the sword:
34296,LXXXII,"But adamantine was his corslet's rind,"
34297,LXXXII,Nor link the restless faulchion broke or bored.
34298,LXXXII,"If so impassive was the paynim's scale,"
34299,LXXXII,"Know, charmed by magic was the stubborn mail."
34300,LXXXII,
34301,LXXXIII,LXXXIII
34302,LXXXIII,"Without reposing they long time had been,"
34303,LXXXIII,"Upon their deadly battle so intent,"
34304,LXXXIII,"That, save on one another's troubled mien,"
34305,LXXXIII,Their angry eyes the warriors had not bent.
34306,LXXXIII,"When such despiteous war and deadly spleen,"
34307,LXXXIII,"Diverted by another strife, were spent,"
34308,LXXXIII,"Hearing a mighty noise, both champions turn,"
34309,LXXXIII,"And good Baiardo, sore bested, discern."
34310,LXXXIII,
34311,LXXXIV,LXXXIV
34312,LXXXIV,"They good Baiardo by a monster view,"
34313,LXXXIV,"-- A bird, and bigger than that courser -- prest."
34314,LXXXIV,Above three yards in length appeared to view
34315,LXXXIV,The monster's beak; a bat in all the rest.
34316,LXXXIV,"Equipt with feathers, black as ink in hue,"
34317,LXXXIV,And piercing talons was the winged pest;
34318,LXXXIV,"An eye of fire it had, a cruel look,"
34319,LXXXIV,"And, like ship-sails, two spreading pinions shook."
34320,LXXXIV,
34321,LXXXV,LXXXV
34322,LXXXV,Perhaps it was a bird; but when or where
34323,LXXXV,Another bird resembling this was seen
34324,LXXXV,"I know not, I, nor have I any where,"
34325,LXXXV,"Except in Turpin, heard that such has been."
34326,LXXXV,"Hence that it was a fiend, to upper air"
34327,LXXXV,Evoked from depths of nether hell I ween;
34328,LXXXV,"Which Malagigi raised by magic sleight,"
34329,LXXXV,That so he might disturb the champions' fight.
34330,LXXXV,
34331,LXXXVI,LXXXVI
34332,LXXXVI,So deemed Rinaldo too: and contest sore
34333,LXXXVI,'Twixt him and Malagigi hence begun;
34334,LXXXVI,"But he would not confess the charge; nay swore,"
34335,LXXXVI,"Even by the light which lights the glorious sun,"
34336,LXXXVI,"That he might clear him of the blame he bore,"
34337,LXXXVI,He had not that which was imputed done.
34338,LXXXVI,"Whether a fiend or fowl, the pest descends,"
34339,LXXXVI,And good Baiardo with his talons rends.
34340,LXXXVI,
34341,LXXXVII,LXXXVII
34342,LXXXVII,"Quickly the steed, possessed of mickle might,"
34343,LXXXVII,"Breaks loose, and, in his fury and despair,"
34344,LXXXVII,Against the monster strives with kick and bite;
34345,LXXXVII,But swiftly he retires and soars in air:
34346,LXXXVII,"He thence returning, prompt to wheel and smite,"
34347,LXXXVII,"Circles and beats the courser, here and there."
34348,LXXXVII,"Wholly unskilled in fence, and sore bested,"
34349,LXXXVII,Baiardo swiftly from the monster fled.
34350,LXXXVII,
34351,LXXXVIII,LXXXVIII
34352,LXXXVIII,"Baiardo to the neighbouring forest flies,"
34353,LXXXVIII,Seeking the closest shade and thickest spray;
34354,LXXXVIII,"Above the feathered monster flaps, with eyes"
34355,LXXXVIII,Intent to mark where widest is the way.
34356,LXXXVIII,"But that good horse the greenwood threads, and lies"
34357,LXXXVIII,"At last within a grot, concealed from day."
34358,LXXXVIII,When the winged beast has lost Baiardo's traces.
34359,LXXXVIII,"He soars aloft, and other quarry chases."
34360,LXXXVIII,
34361,LXXXIX,LXXXIX
34362,LXXXIX,"Rinaldo and Gradasso, who descried"
34363,LXXXIX,"Baiardo's flight, the conqueror's destined meed,"

34365,LXXXIX,"Till they regained the goodly horse, agreed,"
34366,LXXXIX,"Saved from that fowl which chased him, far and wide;"
34367,LXXXIX,"Conditioning whichever found the steed,"
34368,LXXXIX,"With him anew should to that fountain wend,"
34369,LXXXIX,Beside whose brim their battle they should end.

34371,XC,XC
34372,XC,"Quitting the fount, they follow, where they view"
34373,XC,New prints upon the forest greensward made:
34374,XC,"By much Baiardo distances the two,"
34375,XC,Whose tardy feet their wishes ill obeyed.
34376,XC,"Himself the king on his Alfana threw,"
34377,XC,"That near at hand was tethered in the glade,"
34378,XC,Leaving his foe behind in evil plight;
34379,XC,-- Never more malcontent and vext in sprite.
34380,XC,
34381,XCI,XCI
34382,XCI,Rinaldo ceased in little time to spy
34383,XCI,"Baiardo's traces, who strange course had run;"
34384,XCI,"And made for thorny thicket, wet or dry,"
34385,XCI,"Tree, rock, or river, with design to shun"
34386,XCI,"Those cruel claws, which, pouncing from the sky,"
34387,XCI,To him such outrage and such scathe had done.
34388,XCI,"Rinaldo, after labour vain and sore"
34389,XCI,To await him at the fount returned once more;
34390,XCI,
34391,XCII,XCII
34392,XCII,"In case, as erst concerted by the twain,"
34393,XCII,The king should thither with the steed resort;
34394,XCII,"But having sought him there with little gain,"
34395,XCII,"Fared to his camp afoot, with piteous port."
34396,XCII,"Return we now to him of Sericane,"
34397,XCII,"He that had sped withal in other sort,"
34398,XCII,"Who, not by judgement, guided to his prey,"
34399,XCII,"But his rare fortune, heard Baiardo neigh;"
34400,XCII,
34401,XCIII,XCIII
34402,XCIII,"And found him shrowded in his caverned lair,"
34403,XCIII,"So sore moreover by his fright opprest,"
34404,XCIII,He feared to issue into open air.
34405,XCIII,Thus of that horse himself the king possest.
34406,XCIII,Well he remembered their conditions were
34407,XCIII,To bring him to the fount; but little pressed
34408,XCIII,"Now was that knight to keep the promise made,"
34409,XCIII,And thus within himself in secret said:
34410,XCIII,
34411,XCIV,XCIV
34412,XCIV,"""Win him who will, in war and strife, I more"
34413,XCIV,Desire in peace to make the steed my own:
34414,XCIV,"From the world's further side, did I of yore"
34415,XCIV,"Wend hitherward, and for this end alone."
34416,XCIV,"Having the courser, he mistakes me sore,"
34417,XCIV,That thinks the prize by me will be foregone.
34418,XCIV,"Him would Rinaldo conquer, let him fare"

34422,XCV,"""For him no less secure is Sericane,"
34423,XCV,"Than twice for me has been his France,"" he said,"
34424,XCV,"And pricked for Arles, along the road most plain,"
34425,XCV,And in its haven found the fleet arrayed.
34426,XCV,"Freighted with him, the steed and Durindane,"
34427,XCV,A well-rigged galley from that harbour weighed.
34428,XCV,"Of these hereafter! -- I, at other call,"

34435,XCVI,That hawk and eagle soar a course less free.
34436,XCVI,O'er the wide land of Gaul the warrior flew
34437,XCVI,"From Pyrenees to Rhine, from sea to sea."
34438,XCVI,"He westward to the mountains turned aside,"

34684,CXXI,Of noisome ordure on the board descends.

34705,CXXIII,"Of his good horn remembers him the peer,"

34726,CXXV,The harpies are not proof against the sound;
34727,CXXV,"In terror form the royal dome they speed,"

34731,CXXVI,After them spurs in haste the valiant peer:
34732,CXXVI,"And on the winged courser forth is flown,"
34733,CXXVI,"Leaving beneath him, in his swift career,"
34734,CXXVI,The royal castle and the crowded town;
34735,CXXVI,"The bugle ever pealing, far and near."

34938,XVII,In mickle fame increased that baron bold.
34939,XVII,"His feats of many a sort, and valour high"

34949,XVIII,"He, when he deemed he had deserved such gain,"
34950,XVIII,"Pressed close the Lydian king, upon a day,"
34951,XVIII,"And craved me from the monarch as his wife,"
34952,XVIII,As meed of all that booty made in strife.

34954,XIX,XIX
34955,XIX,"""Rejected of the monarch was the peer,"
34956,XIX,Who was resolved his child should highly wed;
34957,XIX,Not him who was a simple cavalier;
34958,XIX,"Who, saving valour, was with nought bested."
34959,XIX,"For on my father, bent on gain and gear"
34960,XIX,"And avarice, of all vice the fountain-head,"

35000,XXIII,Himself from every other loss to save;

35019,XXV,"I who perceive he loves, address not now"
35020,XXV,The warrior as I was resolved before.
35021,XXV,"My vantage I descry, and shift my ground,"

35029,XXVI,"Who with more grace my person would have won,"
35030,XXVI,"Nor waited many days, had he maintained"

35242,XLVII,And bathed himself all over in the flood.

35244,XLVIII,XLVIII
35245,XLVIII,"Then backed the griffin-horse, and soared a flight"

36606,X,Nor against conquered foe their bosom steeled.
36607,X,Not only gentle Bradamant forbore
36608,X,"To harm the knights whom, smitten on the shield,"
36609,X,Her lance unhorsed; but for the vanquished crew
36610,X,"Detained their steeds, that they might mount anew."

36612,XI,XI
36613,XI,"I of that lady fair, of mickle might,"
36614,XI,"Told you above, how she had overthrown"
36615,XI,"Serpentine of the Star in single fight,"
36616,XI,"Grandonio and Ferrau, and then upon"
36617,XI,Their coursers had replaced each baffled knight.
36618,XI,I told moreover how the third was gone
36619,XI,"Rogero to defy to the career,"
36620,XI,"Upon her call, who seemed a cavalier."
36621,XI,
36622,XII,XII
36623,XII,"Rogero heard the call in joyous vein,"
36624,XII,And bade his arms be brought; now while in view
36625,XII,"Of Agramant he donned the plate and chain,"
36626,XII,Those lords the former question moved anew;
36627,XII,"Who was the knight, that on the martial plain"
36628,XII,The manage of the lance so quaintly knew?
36629,XII,"And of Ferrau, who spake with him whilere,"
36630,XII,"Craved, if to him was known that cavalier."
36631,XII,
36632,XIII,XIII
36633,XIII,"""Be ye assured,"" to them Ferrau replied,"
36634,XIII,"""He is not one of those I hear you cite"
36635,XIII,To me (for I his open face descried).
36636,XIII,Rinaldo's youthful brother seemed the knight.
36637,XIII,"But since his doughty valour I have tried,"
36638,XIII,"And wot not such is Richardetto's might,"
36639,XIII,"I ween it is his sister, who, I hear,"
36640,XIII,Resembles much in mien that martial peer.
36641,XIII,
36642,XIV,XIV
36643,XIV,"""The damsel equals well, so Rumour tells,"
36644,XIV,"Rinaldo, and every paladin in fray."
36645,XIV,"But brother she and cousin both excels,"
36646,XIV,"Measured by that which I have seen to-day."""
36647,XIV,"Hearing him, while upon her praise he dwells,"
36648,XIV,"As the sky reddens with the morning ray,"
36649,XIV,"Rogero's face is flushed with crimson hue,"
36650,XIV,"And his heart throbs, nor knows he what to do."
36651,XIV,
36652,XV,XV
36653,XV,"Stung, at these tidings, by the amorous dart --"
36654,XV,"Within, new fire inflames the cavalier;"
36655,XV,"And strait, together with the burning smart,"
36656,XV,"Shoots through his bones a chill, produced by fear;"
36657,XV,"Fear, that new wrath had stifled in her heart"
36658,XV,"That mighty love, wherewith she burned whilere."
36659,XV,"Confused he stands, irresolute and slow,"
36660,XV,And undecided if to stay or go.
36661,XV,
36662,XVI,XVI
36663,XVI,"Now fierce Marphisa, who was there, and prest"
36664,XVI,"By huge desire to meet the stranger wight,"
36665,XVI,"And armed withal (for, save in iron vest,"
36666,XVI,Her seldom would you find by day or night).
36667,XVI,"Hearing Rogero is in armour drest,"
36668,XVI,"Fearing to lose the honour of the fight,"
36669,XVI,If first that champion with the stranger vies;
36670,XVI,Thinks to prevent the youth and win the prize.
36671,XVI,
36672,XVII,XVII
36673,XVII,"She leapt upon her horse, and thither hied"
36674,XVII,"Where Aymon's daughter on the listed plain,"
36675,XVII,"With palpitating heart, upon her side,"
36676,XVII,Waited Rogero; whom the damsel fain
36677,XVII,"Would make her prisoner, and but schemed to guide"
36678,XVII,Her lance in mode the stripling least to pain.
36679,XVII,"Marphisa from the city portal fares,"
36680,XVII,And on her gallant helm a phoenix wears.
36681,XVII,
36682,XVIII,XVIII
36683,XVIII,"Whether the maid would publish, in her pride,"
36684,XVIII,"That she was single in the world, for might;"
36685,XVIII,"Or whether by that symbol signified,"
36686,XVIII,"That she would live, exempt from bridal rite."
36687,XVIII,Her closely Aymon's martial daughter eyed;
36688,XVIII,"When seeing not those features, her delight,"
36689,XVIII,"She craves the damsel's name before they move,"
36690,XVIII,And hears that it is she who joys her love:
36691,XVIII,
36692,XIX,XIX
36693,XIX,"Or rather she, that gentle lady thought,"
36694,XIX,"Had joyed her love; and whom she hated so,"
36695,XIX,"Her to Death's door her anger would have brought,"
36696,XIX,Unless she venged her sorrow on the foe.
36697,XIX,"She wheeled her courser round, with fury fraught,"
36698,XIX,"Less with desire to lay her rival low,"
36699,XIX,"Than with the lance to pierce her in mid breast,"
36700,XIX,And put her every jealousy at rest.
36701,XIX,
36702,XX,XX
36703,XX,"Parforce to ground must go the royal maid,"
36704,XX,"To prove it hard or soft the listed plain,"
36705,XX,"And be with such unwonted scorn appaid,"
36706,XX,That she is nearly maddened by disdain.
36707,XX,"Scarce was she thrown, before her trenchant blade"
36708,XX,"She bared, and hurried to avenge the stain."
36709,XX,"Cried Aymon's daughter, no less proud of heart,"
36710,XX,"""What art thou doing?  Thou my prisoner art."""
36711,XX,
36712,XXI,XXI
36713,XXI,"""Though I have courtesy for others, none"""
36714,XXI,"(She said) ""from me, Marphisa, shalt thou find."
36715,XXI,"Since evermore I hear of thee, as one"
36716,XXI,"To pride and every churlishness inclined."""
36717,XXI,"Marphisa, at these words, was heard to groan,"
36718,XXI,As roars in some sea-rock the prisoned wind.
36719,XXI,She screamed an answer; but its sense was drowned
36720,XXI,(Such rage confused that damsel) in the sound.
36721,XXI,
36722,XXII,XXII
36723,XXII,"She whirls this while her faulchion, and would fain"
36724,XXII,Wound horse or rider in the paunch or breast;
36725,XXII,But Aymon's watchful daughter turns the rein;
36726,XXII,And on one side her courser leaps; possest
36727,XXII,"With furious anger and with fierce disdain,"
36728,XXII,She at her opposite her lance addrest;
36729,XXII,"And hardly touched the damsel, ere, astound,"
36730,XXII,"Marphisa fell, reversed upon the ground."
36731,XXII,
36732,XXIII,XXIII
36733,XXIII,"Scarce down, Marphisa started from the plain,"
36734,XXIII,"Intent fell mischief with her sword to do,"
36735,XXIII,"Bradamant couched her golden spear again,"
36736,XXIII,And yet again the damsel overthrew.
36737,XXIII,"Yet Bradamant, though blest with might and main,"
36738,XXIII,Was not so much the stronger of the two
36739,XXIII,"As to have flung the maid in every just,"
36740,XXIII,But that such power was in the lance's thrust.
36741,XXIII,
36742,XXIV,XXIV
36743,XXIV,"This while some knights (some knights upon our side,"
36744,XXIV,"I say) forth issuing from the city, go"
36745,XXIV,"Towards the field of strife, which did divide"
36746,XXIV,"The squadrons, here and there, of either foe"
36747,XXIV,-- Not half a league of one another wide --
36748,XXIV,Seeing their knight such mighty prowess show;
36749,XXIV,"Their knight, but whom no otherwise they knew"
36750,XXIV,Than as a warrior of the Christian crew.
36751,XXIV,
36752,XXV,XXV
36753,XXV,"Troyano's generous son, who had espied"
36754,XXV,"This band approaching to the city-wall,"
36755,XXV,"For due defence would every means provide,"
36756,XXV,"And every peril, every case forestall:"
36757,XXV,"And orders many to take arms, who ride"
36758,XXV,"Forth from the ramparts, at the monarch's call."
36759,XXV,"With them Rogero goes, in armour cased,"
36760,XXV,Balked of the battle by Marphisa's haste.
36761,XXV,
36762,XXVI,XXVI
36763,XXVI,"The enamoured youth, with beating heart, intent,"
36764,XXVI,"Stood by, the issue of the just to view."
36765,XXVI,"For his dear cousin fearing the event,"
36766,XXVI,In that he well Marphisa's valour knew;
36767,XXVI,"-- At the beginning I would say -- when, bent"
36768,XXVI,"On mischief, fiercely closed the furious two:"
36769,XXVI,"But when that duel's turn the stripling eyes,"
36770,XXVI,He stands amazed and stupid with surprize;
36771,XXVI,
36772,XXVII,XXVII
36773,XXVII,"And when he saw unfinished was the fight,"
36774,XXVII,"At the first onset, like the justs whilere,"
36775,XXVII,"Misdoubting some strange accident, in sprite,"
36776,XXVII,"Sore vexed, this while remained the cavalier."
36777,XXVII,To either maid wished well that youthful knight;
36778,XXVII,"For both were loved, but not alike were dear."
36779,XXVII,"For this the stripling's love was fury, fire;"
36780,XXVII,For that 'twas rather fondness than desire.
36781,XXVII,
36782,XXVIII,XXVIII
36783,XXVIII,"If so Rogero could with honour do,"
36784,XXVIII,He willingly the warriors would divide;
36785,XXVIII,"But his companions, in the fear to view"
36786,XXVIII,"Victory with King Charles's knight abide,"
36787,XXVIII,"Esteeming him the better of the two,"
36788,XXVIII,Break in between and turn their arms aside;
36789,XXVIII,"Upon the other part, the Christian foes"
36790,XXVIII,"Advance, and both divisions come to blows."
36791,XXVIII,
36792,XXIX,XXIX
36793,XXIX,"On this side and that other, rings the alarm,"
36794,XXIX,"Which in those camps is sounded every day,"
36795,XXIX,"Bidding the unmounted mount, the unarmed arm,"
36796,XXIX,"And all their standards seek, without delay,"
36797,XXIX,"Where, under separate flags, the squadrons swarm,"
36798,XXIX,More than one shrilling trump is heard to bray;
36799,XXIX,"And as their rattling notes the riders call,"
36800,XXIX,"Rousing the foot, beat drum and ataball."
36801,XXIX,

36803,XXX,"As fierce as thought could think, 'twixt either host"

36808,XXX,"-- Marphisa with avenging steel to slay, --"
36809,XXX,"Now here, not there, amid the medley flies,"
36810,XXX,Hoping to see the youth for whom she sighs.
36811,XXX,
36812,XXXI,XXXI
36813,XXXI,By the eagle argent on the shield of blue
36814,XXXI,"She recognized Rogero, mid the rest."
36815,XXXI,"With eyes and thought intent, she stops to view"
36816,XXXI,"The warrior's manly shoulders and his breast,"
36817,XXXI,Fair face and movements full of graceful shew;
36818,XXXI,"And then the maid, with mickle spite possest,"
36819,XXXI,"Thinking another joys the stripling's love,"
36820,XXXI,"Thus speaks, as sovereign rage and fury move."
36821,XXXI,

36826,XXXII,"For it not mine, no other's shalt thou be."
36827,XXXII,"Rather than die alone and of despite,"
36828,XXXII,"I with this hand will slay myself and thee,"
36829,XXXII,"That if I lose thee here, at least in hell"
36830,XXXII,With thee I to eternity may dwell.

36832,XXXIII,XXXIII
36833,XXXIII,"""If thou slay'st me, there is good reason, I"

36837,XXXIII,"Nor, since you justly, I unjustly, die,"
36838,XXXIII,Deem I that thine is equal to my pain.
36839,XXXIII,"I him who seeks my life, alas!  shall spill,"
36840,XXXIII,Thou her that loves and worships thee wouldst kill.
36841,XXXIII,
36842,XXXIV,XXXIV
36843,XXXIV,"""My hand, why hast thou not the hardiment"
36844,XXXIV,"To rive with steel the bosom of my foe,"
36845,XXXIV,"That me so many times to death has shent,"
36846,XXXIV,"Under the faith of love, in peaceful show;"
36847,XXXIV,"Him, who to take my life can now consent,"
36848,XXXIV,Nor even have pity of my cruel woe?
36849,XXXIV,"Dare, valiant heart, this impious man to slay,"

36851,XXXIV,
36852,XXXV,XXXV
36853,XXXV,"So said, she spurred at him amid the throng;"
36854,XXXV,"But, first -- ""Defend thee, false Rogero!"" -- cried."
36855,XXXV,"""No more, if I have power, in spoil and wrong,"
36856,XXXV,"Done to a virgin heart, shalt thou take pride."""
36857,XXXV,"Hearing that voice the hostile ranks among,"
36858,XXXV,He deems -- and truly deems -- he hears his bride;
36859,XXXV,"Whose voice the youth remembers in such wise,"
36860,XXXV,That mid a thousand would he recognize.
36861,XXXV,
36862,XXXVI,XXXVI
36863,XXXVI,"Her further meaning well did he divine,"
36864,XXXVI,"Weening that him she in that speech would blame,"
36865,XXXVI,"For having broke their pact; and -- with design,"
36866,XXXVI,"The occasion of his failure to proclaim, --"
36867,XXXVI,Of his desire for parley made a sign:
36868,XXXVI,"But she, with vizor closed, already came,"
36869,XXXVI,"Raging and grieved, intent, with vengeful hand,"
36870,XXXVI,To fling the youth; nor haply upon sand.
36871,XXXVI,
36872,XXXVII,XXXVII
36873,XXXVII,"Rogero, when he saw her so offended,"
36874,XXXVII,"Fixed himself firmly in his arms and seat,"
36875,XXXVII,"He rests his lance, but holds the stave suspended,"
36876,XXXVII,"So that it shall not harm her when they meet,"
36877,XXXVII,"She that to smite and pierce the Child intended,"
36878,XXXVII,"Pitiless, and inflamed with furious heat,"
36879,XXXVII,"Has not the courage, when she sees him near,"

36881,XXXVII,
36882,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
36883,XXXVIII,"Void of effect, 'tis thus their lances go;"
36884,XXXVIII,"And it is well; since Love with burning dart,"
36885,XXXVIII,"Tilting this while at one and the other foe,"
36886,XXXVIII,Has lanced the enamoured warriors in mid-heart.
36887,XXXVIII,"Unable at the Child to aim her blow,"
36888,XXXVIII,"The lady spent her rage in other part,"
36889,XXXVIII,"And mighty deeds achieved, which fame will earn,"
36890,XXXVIII,While overhead the circling heavens shall turn.

36893,XXXIX,Above three hundred men in that affray

37616,XXVI,XXVI
37617,XXVI,"They rode an-end; and louder waxed the sound,"

37619,XXVI,When in a valley they three women found
37620,XXVI,"Making that plaint, who in strange garb appeared:"
37621,XXVI,"For to the navel were those three ungowned,"
37622,XXVI,-- Their coats by some uncourteous varlet sheared --
37623,XXVI,And knowing not how better to disguise
37624,XXVI,"Their shame, they sate on earth, and dared not rise."
37625,XXVI,
37626,XXVII,XXVII
37627,XXVII,"As Vulcan's son, that sprang (as it is versed)"
37628,XXVII,"Out of the dust, without a mother made,"
37629,XXVII,Whom -- so Minerva bade -- Aglauros nursed
37630,XXVII,"With sovereign care, too bold and curious maid,"
37631,XXVII,"Seated in car, by him constructed first"
37632,XXVII,"To hide his hideous feet, was erst conveyed;"
37633,XXVII,"So that which never is to sight revealed,"
37634,XXVII,"Sitting, those mournful damsels kept concealed."
37635,XXVII,
37636,XXVIII,XXVIII
37637,XXVIII,"At that dishonest sight and shameful, glows"
37638,XXVIII,"Each martial damsel's visage, overspread"
37639,XXVIII,"With the rich dyes of Paestum's crimson rose,"
37640,XXVIII,When vernal airs their gentle influence shed.
37641,XXVIII,Bradamant marked them; and that one of those
37642,XXVIII,"Was Ulany, the damsel quickly read;"
37643,XXVIII,"Ulany, that was sent with solemn train"
37644,XXVIII,From the LOST ISLE to royal Charlemagne;
37645,XXVIII,
37646,XXIX,XXIX
37647,XXIX,And recognised the other two no less;
37648,XXIX,"From them she saw, when she saw Ulany;"
37649,XXIX,But now to her directed her address.
37650,XXIX,"As the most honoured of those ladies three,"
37651,XXIX,"Demanding, who so full of wickedness,"
37652,XXIX,"So lawless was and so unmannerly,"
37653,XXIX,"That he those secrets to the sight revealed,"

37660,XXX,"With her victorious lance on earth had laid,"
37661,XXX,"How, in a town not far remote -- replied --"
37662,XXX,"An evil race, by pity never swayed,"
37663,XXX,"Besides that they their raiment thus had shorn,"

37665,XXX,
37666,XXXI,XXXI
37667,XXXI,"What of the shield became, she cannot say,"
37668,XXXI,"Nor knows she those three monarchs' destiny,"
37669,XXXI,Who guided her so long upon her way;
37670,XXXI,"If killed, or led into captivity;"
37671,XXXI,"And says that she herself has ta'en her way,"
37672,XXXI,"Albeit to fare a-foot sore irksome be,"
37673,XXXI,"To appeal to royal Charlemagne, assured"
37674,XXXI,By him such outrage will not be endured.
37675,XXXI,
37676,XXXII,XXXII
37677,XXXII,"To hear, yet more to see, so foul a wrong,"
37678,XXXII,Disturbed the Child and damsels' placid air
37679,XXXII,"And beauteous visage, whose bold hearts and strong"
37680,XXXII,No less compassionate than valiant were.
37681,XXXII,"They now, all else forgetting, ere the tongue"
37682,XXXII,"Of Ulany prefers demand, or prayer,"
37683,XXXII,"That they would venge them on their cruel foe,"
37684,XXXII,In haste towards the felon's castle go.
37685,XXXII,
37686,XXXIII,XXXIII
37687,XXXIII,"With one constant, the maids and cavalier,"
37688,XXXIII,"By their great goodness moved, from plate and mail"
37689,XXXIII,"Had stript their upper vests, well fitting gear"
37690,XXXIII,Those miserable ladies' shame to veil.
37691,XXXIII,"Bradamant suffers not, that, as whilere,"
37692,XXXIII,Sad Ulany shall tramp by hill and dale;
37693,XXXIII,But seats her on her horse's croup; so do
37694,XXXIII,Her comrades by those other damsels two.
37695,XXXIII,
37696,XXXIV,XXXIV
37697,XXXIV,To gentle Bradamant Ulania showed
37698,XXXIV,The nearest way to reach the castle height;
37699,XXXIV,"While comfort Bradamant on her bestowed,"
37700,XXXIV,Promising vengeance for that foul despite.
37701,XXXIV,"They leave the vale, and by a crooked road"
37702,XXXIV,"And long ascend, now wheeling left, now right:"
37703,XXXIV,"Nor till the sun is hidden in the sea,"
37704,XXXIV,Upon their weary way repose the three.
37705,XXXIV,

37707,XXXV,"They to a hamlet on the summit wound,"
37708,XXXV,Scaling the mountain's steep and rugged side;
37709,XXXV,"And such good shelter and good supper found,"
37710,XXXV,As could by such rude quarters be supplied.
37711,XXXV,"Arriving there, they turned their eyes around,"
37712,XXXV,"And full of women every place espied,"
37713,XXXV,"Some old, some young; nor, mid so large a clan,"
37714,XXXV,Appeared the visage of a single man.
37715,XXXV,
37716,XXXVI,XXXVI
37717,XXXVI,"Not more bold Jason wondered, and the train"
37718,XXXVI,"Which sailed with him, that Argonautic crew,"
37719,XXXVI,"Seeing those dames that had their husbands slain,"
37720,XXXVI,"Fathers and sons and brethren, -- so that through"
37721,XXXVI,"All Lemnos' pleasant isle, by hill or plain,"
37722,XXXVI,Of manly visage they beheld not two --
37723,XXXVI,"Than here Rogero, and the rest who go"

37725,XXXVI,
37726,XXXVII,XXXVII
37727,XXXVII,"The martial damsels bid for Ulany,"

37729,XXXVII,"And gowns that eve are furnished for the three,"
37730,XXXVII,"If meaner than their own, at least entire."
37731,XXXVII,To him a woman of that villagery
37732,XXXVII,"Valiant Rogero summons, to inquire"
37733,XXXVII,Where are the men; in that he none descries;
37734,XXXVII,And thus to him that village wife replies:

37736,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
37737,XXXVIII,"""What haply is to you a wonderment,"
37738,XXXVIII,"This crowd of womankind, where man is none,"
37739,XXXVIII,"To us is grave and grievous punishment,"
37740,XXXVIII,"Who, banished here, live wofully alone;"
37741,XXXVIII,"And, that such exile us may more torment,"
37742,XXXVIII,"From those so loved, as brother, father, son,"
37743,XXXVIII,"A long divorce and cruel we sustain,"
37744,XXXVIII,As our fell tyrant pleases to ordain.

37747,XXXIX,"""Sent to these confines from his land, which lies"
37748,XXXIX,"But two leagues distant thence, where we were born,"
37749,XXXIX,"Us in this place the fell barbarian sties,"
37750,XXXIX,Having first done us many a brutal scorn;
37751,XXXIX,And has with death and all extremities

37762,XL,"Their leafy honours twice, and twice renewed,"
37763,XL,"Since our lord's fury to such pitch arose,"

37767,XLI,"""For he has spread such passing fear among"
37768,XLI,"The people, death can cause no worse affright;"
37769,XLI,"In that, beside his natural love of wrong,"
37770,XLI,He is endowed with more than human might.
37771,XLI,"He than a hundred other men more strong,"
37772,XLI,In body is of a gigantic height:

38172,LXXXI,Placed such his pleasures on these confines: woe

38179,LXXXII,"Let none know this, who might the deed report!"
38180,LXXXII,For sorely mulcted for the transgression were
38181,LXXXII,"Many, and many slain in cruel sort."
38182,LXXXII,A statute for his town next made the peer:
38183,LXXXII,Of fouler law we neither read nor hear.

38221,LXXXVI,"Serves as a signal to the starry train,"
38222,LXXXVI,"That they should all before the sun recede,"

38249,LXXXIX,The poisoned draught of foul effect had brewed.
38250,LXXXIX,From the others she and those solemnites
38251,LXXXIX,"Had kept away, suspecting what ensued:"
38252,LXXXIX,"Yea, this while, from that lordship had she fled,"

38290,XCIII,"But speedy death appears too kind a pain,"
38291,XCIII,And insufficient for such foul offence.

38293,XCIII,He all the bitterness of death should know.

38298,XCIV,And the quick rowel and the loosened rein
38299,XCIV,Made the quick coursers make that labour short.
38300,XCIV,Never had those assaulted to sustain
38301,XCIV,Encounter of so fell and fierce a sort;
38302,XCIV,"Who held it for a grace, with loss of shield,"
38303,XCIV,"Harness and captive dame, to quit the field;"

38317,XCVI,But many horses they as well forsook;
38318,XCVI,"And, as the surest refuge in their fear,"
38319,XCVI,Cast themselves down from bank and caverned nook:
38320,XCVI,Which pleased the damsels and the youthful peer;
38321,XCVI,"Who three of those forsaken horses took,"
38322,XCVI,"To mount those three, whom, through the day before,"

38325,XCVII,XCVII
38326,XCVII,"Thence, lightened thus, their way they thither bend,"

38332,XCVII,"For flinging her upon Frontino's croup,"
38333,XCVII,Rogero bears her off amid the troop.
38334,XCVII,
38335,XCVIII,XCVIII
38336,XCVIII,"They reached a summit, and from thence espied"
38337,XCVIII,"A town with many houses, large and rich;"
38338,XCVIII,"With nought to stop the way on any side,"
38339,XCVIII,As neither compassed round by wall or ditch.
38340,XCVIII,"A rock was in the middle, fortified"
38341,XCVIII,"With a tall tower, upon its topmost pitch."
38342,XCVIII,"Fearlessly thither pricked the warriors, who"
38343,XCVIII,Marganor's mansion in that fortress knew.
38344,XCVIII,
38345,XCIX,XCIX
38346,XCIX,As soon as in the town that cavalcade
38347,XCIX,"Arrived, some footmen, who kept watch and ward,"
38348,XCIX,Behind those warriors closed a barricade;
38349,XCIX,"While that, before, they found already barred."
38350,XCIX,"And lo!  Sir Marganor, with men arraid,"
38351,XCIX,"Some foot, some horsemen!  armed was all the guard;"
38352,XCIX,"Who to the strangers, in few words, but bold,"
38353,XCIX,The wicked custom of his lordship told.

38356,C,"Marphisa, who had planned the thing whilere"

38359,C,"And, valiant as she was and full of might,"
38360,C,"Not putting in the rest her puissant spear,"
38361,C,"Or baring that good sword, so famed in fight,"
38362,C,"So smote him with her fist upon the head,"

38365,CI,CI
38366,CI,"The maid of France is with Marphisa gone,"
38367,CI,Nor in the rear it seen Rogero's crest;
38368,CI,"Who with those two his course so bravely run,"
38369,CI,"That, though his lance he raised not from the rest,"
38370,CI,"Six men he slew; transfixed the paunch of one,"
38371,CI,"Another's head, of four the neck or breast;"
38372,CI,"I' the sixth he broke it, whom in flight he speared:"
38373,CI,It pierced his spine and at his paps appeared.

38375,CII,CII
38376,CII,"As many as are touched, so many lie"
38377,CII,"On earth, by Bradamant's gold lance o'erthrown;"
38378,CII,"She seems a bolt, dismist form burning sky,"
38379,CII,"Which, in its fury, shivers and beats down"
38380,CII,"Whatever it encounters, far and nigh."
38381,CII,"Some fly to plain, or castle from the town,"
38382,CII,Others to sheltering church and house repair;
38383,CII,"And none, save dead, are seen in street or square."
38384,CII,
38385,CIII,CIII
38386,CIII,"Meanwhile the hands of Marganor, behind"
38387,CIII,"His back, the fierce Marphisa had made fast,"
38388,CIII,"And to Drusilla's maid the wretch consigned,"
38389,CIII,Well pleased that such a care on her was cast.
38390,CIII,"To burn the town 'twas afterwards designed,"
38391,CIII,"Save it repented of its errors past,"
38392,CIII,"Repealed the statute Marganor had made,"
38393,CIII,"And a new law, imposed by her, obeyed."
38394,CIII,
38395,CIV,CIV
38396,CIV,Such end to compass is no hard assay;
38397,CIV,"For, besides fearing lest Marphisa yearn"
38398,CIV,"To execute more vengeance, -- lest she say,"
38399,CIV,"-- She one and all will slaughter and will burn, --"
38400,CIV,The townsmen all were advised to the sway
38401,CIV,And cruel statute of that tyrant stern;
38402,CIV,"But did, as others mostly do, that best"
38403,CIV,Obey the master whom they most detest.
38404,CIV,
38405,CV,CV
38406,CV,"Since none dares trust another, nor his will,"

38409,CV,"From this his substance, that his honour take."
38410,CV,"But the heart cries to Heaven, that here is still,"
38411,CV,Till God and saints at length to vengeance wake:
38412,CV,"Who, albeit they due punishment suspend,"
38413,CV,By mighty pain the long delay amend.
38414,CV,
38415,CVI,CVI
38416,CVI,"The rabble, full of rage and enmity,"
38417,CVI,Now seeks the wretch with word and deed to grieve;
38418,CVI,"As, it is said, all strip the fallen tree,"
38419,CVI,Which from its roots and wintry winds upheave:
38420,CVI,"Let rulers in his sad example see,"
38421,CVI,Ill doers in the end shall ill receive.
38422,CVI,"To view fell Marganor's disastrous fall,"
38423,CVI,"Fit penance for his sins, pleased great and small."
38424,CVI,

38426,CVII,"Many, of whom the sister had been slain,"

38428,CVII,"Seeking no more their rebel wrath to rein,"
38429,CVII,"Hurry, with their own hands to take his life;"
38430,CVII,And young Rogero and the damsels twain
38431,CVII,Can scarce defend the felon in that strife;
38432,CVII,"Whom those illustrious three had doomed to die,"
38433,CVII,"Mid trouble, fear, and lengthened agony."
38434,CVII,
38435,CVIII,CVIII
38436,CVIII,"To the hag, who bore such hatred to that wight,"
38437,CVIII,"As woman to an enemy can bear,"
38438,CVIII,"They give their prisoner naked, bound so tight,"
38439,CVIII,He will not at one shake the cordage tear;
38440,CVIII,"And she, her pains and sorrow to requite,"
38441,CVIII,"Crimsons the wretch's body, here and there,"
38442,CVIII,"With a sharp goad, which, mid that village band,"
38443,CVIII,A peasant churl had put into her hand.
38444,CVIII,
38445,CIX,CIX
38446,CIX,"Nor she the courier maid, nor they that ride"
38447,CIX,"With her, aye mindful how they had been shent,"
38448,CIX,Now let their hands hang idle by their side;
38449,CIX,No less than that old crone on vengeance bent:
38450,CIX,"Such was their fierce desire, it nullified"
38451,CIX,"The power to harm; but rage must have its vent.,"
38452,CIX,"Him one with stones, another with her nails,"

38459,CX,"Tree, rock, and crop and field, the waters go:"
38460,CX,Then comes a season when its crested pride
38461,CX,"Is vanished, and its vigour wasted so,"
38462,CX,"A child, a woman, everywhere may tread,"
38463,CX,"And often dry-shod cross, its rugged bed."
38464,CX,
38465,CXI,CXI
38466,CXI,So Marganor whilere each bound and bourn
38467,CXI,"Made tremble, whereso'er his name was heard:"
38468,CXI,Now one is come to bruise the tyrant's horn;
38469,CXI,"And now his prowess is so little feared,"
38470,CXI,That even the little children work him scorn:
38471,CXI,Some pluck his hair and others pluck his beard.
38472,CXI,Thence young Rogero and the damsels twain
38473,CXI,Towards his rock-built castle turn the rein.
38474,CXI,
38475,CXII,CXII
38476,CXII,"This without contest its possessors yield,"
38477,CXII,And the rich goods preserved in that repair.
38478,CXII,"These the friends partly spoiled, and partly dealed"
38479,CXII,To Ulany and that attendant pair.
38480,CXII,"With them, recovered was the golden shield,"
38481,CXII,And those three monarchs that were prisoned there;
38482,CXII,"Who, without arms, afoot, towards that hold"
38483,CXII,"Had wended, as meseems whilere was told."
38484,CXII,
38485,CXIII,CXIII

38487,CXIII,"By Bradamant, afoot, they evermore,"
38488,CXIII,"Unarmed, in company with her had gone,"
38489,CXIII,That hither came from her so distant shore.
38490,CXIII,"I know not, I, if it was better done"
38491,CXIII,"Or worse, by her, that they their arms forbore;"
38492,CXIII,"Worse, touching her defence; but better far,"
38493,CXIII,If they were losers in the doubtful war.
38494,CXIII,
38495,CXIV,CXIV
38496,CXIV,"For she would have been dragged, -- like others, whom"
38497,CXIV,"Armed men had thither brought beneath their guide,"
38498,CXIV,"(Unhappy women) to the brothers' tomb, --"
38499,CXIV,And by the sacrifice knife have died.
38500,CXIV,"Death, sure, is worse, and more disastrous doom"
38501,CXIV,Than showing that which modesty would hide;
38502,CXIV,"And they who can to force ascribe the blame,"

38504,CXIV,
38505,CXV,CXV
38506,CXV,"Before they hence depart, the martial twain"

38512,CXV,"-- In fine, man's privileges, whatsoe'er,"
38513,CXV,"They swear, shall be conferred on woman here:"
38514,CXV,
38515,CXVI,CXVI
38516,CXVI,Then make them promise never to bestow
38517,CXVI,"Harbourage on whosoever thither sped,"
38518,CXVI,"Footman or cavalier, nor even allow"
38519,CXVI,"Any beneath a roof to hide his head,"
38520,CXVI,"Unless he swore by God and saints, or vow"
38521,CXVI,Yet stronger made -- if stronger could be said --
38522,CXVI,"That he the sex's cause would aye defend,"
38523,CXVI,"Foe to their foes, and woman's faithful friend;"
38524,CXVI,

38526,CXVII,"And, if he then were wived, or ever were"
38527,CXVII,"-- Sooner or later -- linked in nuptial noose,"
38528,CXVII,"Still to his wife he would allegiance bear,"
38529,CXVII,Nor e'er compliance with her will refuse.
38530,CXVII,"Marphisa says, within the year, she there"
38531,CXVII,"Will be, and ere the trees their foliage lose;"
38532,CXVII,"And, save she find her statute in effect,"
38533,CXVII,That borough fire and ruin may expect.

38535,CXVIII,CXVIII
38536,CXVIII,"Nor hence they part ill from the filthy place,"
38537,CXVIII,"Wherein it lay, Drusilla's corse is borne;"

38540,CXVIII,"Drusilla's ancient woman, in this space,"

38570,CXXI,"Made him, one day, leap headlong from a tower,"
38571,CXXI,Who never took so still a leap before.
38572,CXXI,No more of her and hers!  I of the crew
38573,CXXI,"That journey toward Arles, the tale pursue."

38579,CXXII,"Towards the camp, to Arles the other tends,"
38580,CXXII,"Again embrace the lovers, and oft say"
38581,CXXII,"A last farewell, which evermore offends."
38582,CXXII,The damsels seek the camp; to Arles is gone
38583,CXXII,Rogero; and my canto I have done.

38602,I,That good Rogero should depart again
38603,I,"So suddenly, from her that held him dear,"

38654,VI,The stripling may appay the warlike fair

38693,X,"For Pepin's royal son to her, alone,"
38694,X,"Deserving of such duty seemed to be,"
38695,X,"Mid emperors or kings that filled a throne,"

38710,XII,Marphisa first began in grateful strain:
38711,XII,"""Unconquered Caesar, glorious and august,"
38712,XII,"Who, to Alcides' strait from Indian main,"
38713,XII,Mak'st Scythian's pale and Aethiop's race adust
38714,XII,"Revere thy Christian cross of snowy grain,"
38715,XII,-- Of earthly monarchs thou most sage and just --
38716,XII,"Hither thy glory, which no limits bound,"
38717,XII,Has brought me from the world's extremest ground;
38718,XII,
38719,XIII,XIII
38720,XIII,"""And (to avow the truth) in jealous mood"
38721,XIII,"Alone I came, alone with thee to fight;"
38722,XIII,Because I grudged that king so puissant shou'd
38723,XIII,"Exist on earth, save he observed my rite."
38724,XIII,Hence reek they ravaged fields with Christian blood;
38725,XIII,"And yet with greater rancour and despite,"
38726,XIII,"Like cruel foe, I purposed to offend,"
38727,XIII,"But that it chanced, one changed me to a friend."
38728,XIII,
38729,XIV,XIV
38730,XIV,"""When to worst harm and scaith thy bands I doom,"

38732,XIV,"Rogero of Risa was my father, whom"
38733,XIV,An evil brother traitorously laid low.
38734,XIV,Me my sad mother carried in her womb
38735,XIV,"Beyond the sea, and bore in want and woe."

38739,XV,XV
38740,XV,"""They to a king in Persia vended me,"
38741,XV,"That after died beneath my faulchion, who"
38742,XV,Would fain have taken my virginity.
38743,XV,"When grown, that king and all his court I slew;"
38744,XV,"Chased his ill race, and seized his royalty;"
38745,XV,"And -- such my fortune -- by a month or two,"
38746,XV,"I eithteen years had not o'erpast, before"
38747,XV,I added to my realm six kingdoms more;
38748,XV,
38749,XVI,XVI
38750,XVI,"""And, moved by envy of thy glorious fame"
38751,XVI,I in my heart resolved (as thou hast heard)
38752,XVI,To abate the grandeur of they mighty name:
38753,XVI,I haply so had done; I haply erred.
38754,XVI,"But now a chance has served that will to tame,"
38755,XVI,And clip my fury's wings; the having heard
38756,XVI,"Since I arrived in Christendom, how we"
38757,XVI,Are bound by ties of consanguinity;
38758,XVI,
38759,XVII,XVII
38760,XVII,"""And, for my father thee, as kinsman, served,"

38763,XVII,"Mine arm whilere, now blot from memory."
38764,XVII,"Nay, these for evil Agramant reserved,"
38765,XVII,And for his sire's and uncle's kin shall be;
38766,XVII,They who were whilom guilty of the death
38767,XVII,"Of that unhappy pair, who gave me breath."""

38770,XVIII,"She adds, the Christian faith she will receive,"

38773,XVIII,"Her kingdom to baptize in the Levant,"
38774,XVIII,And war upon whatever nation cleave

38782,XIX,"Much that illustrious lady magnified,"
38783,XIX,"And much her father, much her noble line:"
38784,XIX,He courteously to every point replied;
38785,XIX,And of his heart his open front was sign.
38786,XIX,"As his last words, that he received the maid"
38787,XIX,"As kinswoman and child, the monarch said."
38788,XIX,
38789,XX,XX
38790,XX,"Then rose and locked her in a new embrace,"
38791,XX,"And kissed her, like a daughter, on the brow."
38792,XX,"Morgana and Clermont's kin, with joyful face,"
38793,XX,All thither troop; 'twere tedious to tell how
38794,XX,Rinaldo did the gentle damsel grace;
38795,XX,For he had oftentimes espied ere now
38796,XX,"Her martial prowess, tried by goodly test,"
38797,XX,When they with girding siege Albracca pressed.
38798,XX,
38799,XXI,XXI
38800,XXI,"'Twere long to tell how, with those worthies met,"
38801,XXI,Guido rejoiced to see Marphisa there;
38802,XXI,"Gryphon and Aquilant, and Sansonet,"
38803,XXI,That with her in the cruel city were;
38804,XXI,"Vivian, and Malagigi, and Richardet;"
38805,XXI,"Who, when Maganza's traitors made repair,"
38806,XXI,"With those ill purchasers of Spain to trade,"
38807,XXI,Found such a faithful comrade in the maid.
38808,XXI,
38809,XXII,XXII
38810,XXII,They deck the ground for the ensuing day;
38811,XXII,And Charlemagne takes care himself to see
38812,XXII,"That they the place shall sumptuously array,"
38813,XXII,Wherein Marphisa's baptism is to be.
38814,XXII,"Bishops are gathered, learned clerks, and they"
38815,XXII,Who ken the laws of Christianity;
38816,XXII,That taught in all its doctrine by their care
38817,XXII,And holy skill may be that martial fair.
38818,XXII,
38819,XXIII,XXIII
38820,XXIII,"In sacred stole, pontifical, arraid,"
38821,XXIII,Her the archbishop Turpin did baptize;
38822,XXIII,Charlemagne from the healthful font the maid
38823,XXIII,Uplifted with befitting ceremonies.
38824,XXIII,But it is time the witless head to aid
38825,XXIII,"With that, which treasured in the phial lies,"
38826,XXIII,"Wherewith Astolpho, from the lowest star,"
38827,XXIII,Descended in Elias' fiery car.
38828,XXIII,
38829,XXIV,XXIV
38830,XXIV,"The duke descended from the lucid round,"
38831,XXIV,On this our earthly planet's loftiest height.
38832,XXIV,"Wither he with that blessed vase was bound,"
38833,XXIV,Which was the mighty champion's brain to right.
38834,XXIV,A herb of sovereign virtue on that ground
38835,XXIV,"The apostle shows, and with it bids the knight"
38836,XXIV,"The Nubian's eyeballs touch, when him anew"
38837,XXIV,"He visits, and restore that sovereign's view."
38838,XXIV,
38839,XXV,XXV
38840,XXV,"That he, for this and for his first desert,"
38841,XXV,"May give him bands, Biserta to assail;"
38842,XXV,And shows him how that people inexpert
38843,XXV,"He may to battle train, in plate and mail;"
38844,XXV,"And how to pass the deserts, without hurt,"
38845,XXV,Where men are dazzled by the sandy gale.
38846,XXV,The order that throughout should be maintained
38847,XXV,"From point to point, the sainted sire explained;"
38848,XXV,
38849,XXVI,XXVI
38850,XXVI,"Then made him that plumed beast again bestride,"
38851,XXVI,Rogero's and Atlantes' steed whilere.
38852,XXVI,"By sainted John dismist, his reverend guide,"
38853,XXVI,Those holy regions left the cavalier;
38854,XXVI,"And coasting Nile, on one or the other side,"
38855,XXVI,Saw Nubia's realm before him soon appear;
38856,XXVI,"And there, in its chief city, to the ground"
38857,XXVI,"Descended, and anew Senapus found."
38858,XXVI,
38859,XXVII,XXVII
38860,XXVII,"Great was the joy, and great was the delight,"
38861,XXVII,Wherewith that king received the English lord;
38862,XXVII,Who well remembered how the gentle knight
38863,XXVII,Had from the loathsome harpies freed his board.
38864,XXVII,"But when the humour, that obscured his sight,"
38865,XXVII,"Valiant Astolpho scaled, and now restored"
38866,XXVII,"Was the blind sovereign's eyesight as before,"
38867,XXVII,He would that warrior as a god adore.
38868,XXVII,
38869,XXVIII,XXVIII
38870,XXVIII,So that not only those whom he demands
38871,XXVIII,"For the Bisertine war, he gives in aid;"
38872,XXVIII,"But adds a hundred thousand from his bands,"
38873,XXVIII,And offer of his royal person made.
38874,XXVIII,"Scarce on the open plain embattled stands,"
38875,XXVIII,"-- All foot -- the Nubian host, for war arraid."
38876,XXVIII,For few the horses which that region bore;
38877,XXVIII,Of elephants and camels a large store.
38878,XXVIII,
38879,XXIX,XXIX
38880,XXIX,"The night before the day, when on its road"
38881,XXIX,"The Nubian force should march, Astolpho rose,"
38882,XXIX,And his winged hippogryph again bestrode:
38883,XXIX,"Then, hurrying ever south, in fury goes"
38884,XXIX,"To a high hill, the southern wind's abode;"
38885,XXIX,Whence he towards the Bears in fury blows:
38886,XXIX,"There finds a cave, through whose strait entrance breaks"
38887,XXIX,"The fell and furious Auster, when he wakes."
38888,XXIX,
38889,XXX,XXX
38890,XXX,"He, as his master erst instruction gave,"
38891,XXX,With him an empty bladder had conveyed;
38892,XXX,"Which, at the vent of that dim Alpine cave,"
38893,XXX,"Wherein reposed the wearied wind, was laid"
38894,XXX,Quaintly and softly by the baron brave;
38895,XXX,"And so unlooked for was the ambuscade,"
38896,XXX,"That, issuing forth at morn, to sweep the plains,"
38897,XXX,Auster imprisoned in the skin remains.
38898,XXX,
38899,XXXI,XXXI
38900,XXXI,"To Nubia he, rejoicing in his prey,"
38901,XXXI,"Returns; and with that very light the peer,"
38902,XXXI,"With the black host, sets out upon his way,"
38903,XXXI,And lets the victual follow in his rear.
38904,XXXI,Towards Mount Atlas with his whole array
38905,XXXI,In safety goes the glorious cavalier.
38906,XXXI,"Through shifting plains of powdery sand he past,"
38907,XXXI,Nor dreaded danger from the sultry blast;
38908,XXXI,
38909,XXXII,XXXII
38910,XXXII,"And having gained the mountain's hither side,"
38911,XXXII,"Whence are discerned the plain, and distant brine,"
38912,XXXII,He chooses from the swarm he has to guide
38913,XXXII,The noblest and most fit for discipline;
38914,XXXII,"And makes them, here and there, in troops divide,"
38915,XXXII,"At a hill's foot, wherewith the plains confine;"
38916,XXXII,"Then leaves his host and climbs the hill's ascent,"
38917,XXXII,Like one that is on lofty thoughts intent.
38918,XXXII,
38919,XXXIII,XXXIII
38920,XXXIII,"After he, lowly kneeling in the dust,"
38921,XXXIII,"His holy master had implored, in true"
38922,XXXIII,"Assurance he was heard, he downward thrust"
38923,XXXIII,A heap of stones.  O what things may he do
38924,XXXIII,That in the Saviour wholly puts his trust!
38925,XXXIII,The stones beyond the use of nature grew;
38926,XXXIII,"Which rolling to the sandy plain below,"
38927,XXXIII,"Next, neck and muzzle, legs and belly show."
38928,XXXIII,
38929,XXXIV,XXXIV
38930,XXXIV,"They, neighing shrill, down narrow paths repair,"
38931,XXXIV,"With lusty leaps; and lighting on the plain,"
38932,XXXIV,"Uplift the croup, like coursers as they are,"
38933,XXXIV,"Some bay, some roan, and some of dapple stain."
38934,XXXIV,"The crowds that waiting in the valleys were,"
38935,XXXIV,"Layed hands on them, and seized them by the rein."
38936,XXXIV,"Thus in a thought each soldier had his horse,"
38937,XXXIV,Born ready reined and saddled for the course.
38938,XXXIV,
38939,XXXV,XXXV
38940,XXXV,"He fourscore thousand of his Nubian power,"
38941,XXXV,"One hundred and two footmen, in a day"
38942,XXXV,"To horsemen changes, who wide Afric scour,"
38943,XXXV,"And, upon every side, sack, burn, and slay."
38944,XXXV,"Agramant had intrusted town and tower,"
38945,XXXV,"Till his return, to king Branzardo's sway,"
38946,XXXV,"To Fersa's king, and him of the Algaziers;"
38947,XXXV,And these against Astolpho lead their spears.
38948,XXXV,
38949,XXXVI,XXXVI
38950,XXXVI,"Erewhile a nimble bark, with sail and oar,"
38951,XXXVI,"They had dispatched, which, stirring feet and wings,"
38952,XXXVI,News of the Nubian monarch's outrage bore
38953,XXXVI,"To Agramant from his vicegerent kings,"
38954,XXXVI,"That rests not, night nor day, till to the shore"
38955,XXXVI,Of Provence she her doleful tiding brings;
38956,XXXVI,"And finds her monarch half subdued in Arles,"
38957,XXXVI,For camped within a mile was conquering Charles.
38958,XXXVI,
38959,XXXVII,XXXVII
38960,XXXVII,"Agramant, hearing in what peril lies"
38961,XXXVII,"His realm, through his attack on Pepin's reign,"
38962,XXXVII,"Him in this pressing peril to advise,"
38963,XXXVII,Calls kings and princes of the paynim train;
38964,XXXVII,And when he once or twice has turned his eyes
38965,XXXVII,"On sage Sobrino and the king of Spain,"
38966,XXXVII,-- Eldest and wisest they those lords among --
38967,XXXVII,The monarch so bespeaks the assembled throng:
38968,XXXVII,
38969,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
38970,XXXVIII,"""Albeit if fits not captain, as I know,"
38971,XXXVIII,"To say, `on this I thought not,' this I say;"
38972,XXXVIII,"Because when from a quarter comes the blow,"
38973,XXXVIII,"From every human forethought far away,"
38974,XXXVIII,"'Tis for such fault a fair excuse, I trow;"
38975,XXXVIII,And here all hinges; I did ill to lay
38976,XXXVIII,"Unfurnished Africk open to attack,"
38977,XXXVIII,If there was ground to fear the Nubian sack.
38978,XXXVIII,
38979,XXXIX,XXXIX
38980,XXXIX,"""But who could think, save only God on high"
38981,XXXIX,"Prescient of all which is to be below,"
38982,XXXIX,"That, from land, beneath such distant sky,"

39699,XIX,Branzardo and the king of Algaziers
39700,XIX,Against the duke had mustered all their spears.

39702,XX,XX
39703,XX,"Such as the monarchs could in haste engage,"
39704,XX,"Raked from all Africa, that host contained;"

39706,XX,"Scarce from impressing women they refrained,"
39707,XX,"Resolved his thirst of vengeance to assuage,"
39708,XX,Agramant twice his Africa had drained.

39715,XXI,"Like sheep, their quailing bands Astolpho slew,"
39716,XXI,Charging at his more martial squadrons' head;
39717,XXI,And with the slain filled all that champaign; few
39718,XXI,Into Biserta from the carnage fled.
39719,XXI,A prisoner valiant Bucifar remained;
39720,XXI,The town in safety King Branzardo gained;
39721,XXI,
39722,XXII,XXII
39723,XXII,"More grieved as Bucifaro's loss alone,"
39724,XXII,Than had he lost the rest in arms arrayed.
39725,XXII,Wide and in want of ramparts is the town;
39726,XXII,And these could ill be raised without his aid.
39727,XXII,"While fain to ransom him, he thinks upon"
39728,XXII,"The means, and stands afflicted and dismayed,"

39742,XXIV,XXIV
39743,XXIV,"A paladin himself, Astolpho knows"
39744,XXIV,He gladly ought a paladin to free;
39745,XXIV,"And when that case the Moorish envoy shows,"
39746,XXIV,To King Branzardo's offer does agree.
39747,XXIV,"Dudon from prison loosed, his thanks bestows;"
39748,XXIV,"And whatsoe'er pertains to land or sea,"
39749,XXIV,"Bestirs him to accomplish, in accord"
39750,XXIV,"With his illustrious chief, the English lord."

39752,XXV,XXV
39753,XXV,Astolpho leading such a countless band

39757,XXV,That fair Provence and Aquamorta's strand
39758,XXV,"He from the reaving Saracen should wrest,"
39759,XXV,Made through his numerous host a second draught
39760,XXV,Of such as least inapt for sea he thought;
39761,XXV,
39762,XXVI,XXVI
39763,XXVI,And filling next as full as they could be
39764,XXVI,"His hands with many different sorts of leaves,"
39765,XXVI,"Plucked from palm, olive, bay and cedar tree,"
39766,XXVI,"Approached the shore, and cast them on the waves."
39767,XXVI,Oh blessed souls!  Oh great felicity!
39768,XXVI,O grace!  which rarely man from God receives;
39769,XXVI,"O strange and wondrous miracle, which sprung"

39778,XXVII,"All in a thought transformed to vessels, ride;"
39779,XXVII,"And of as diverse qualities appear,"

39783,XXVIII,It was a miracle to see them grown
39784,XXVIII,"To galliot, galley, frigate ship, and boat;"
39785,XXVIII,"Wondrous, that they with tackling of their own,"
39786,XXVIII,Are found as well as any barks afloat.
39787,XXVIII,"Nor lack there men to govern them, when blown"
39788,XXVIII,By blustering winds -- from islands not remote --
39789,XXVIII,"Sardinia or Corsica, of every rate,"
39790,XXVIII,"Pilot and patron, mariner and mate."
39791,XXVIII,
39792,XXIX,XXIX
39793,XXIX,Twenty-six thousand were the troop that manned
39794,XXIX,Those ready barks of every sort and kind.
39795,XXIX,"To Dudon's government, by sea or land"
39796,XXIX,"A leader sage, the navy was consigned;"
39797,XXIX,"Which yet lay anchored off the Moorish strand,"
39798,XXIX,"Expecting a more favourable wind,"
39799,XXIX,"To put to sea; when, freighted with a load"
39800,XXIX,"Of prisoners, lo!  a vessel made the road."
39801,XXIX,
39802,XXX,XXX
39803,XXX,"She carried those, whom at the bridge of dread,"
39804,XXX,-- On that so narrow place of battle met --
39805,XXX,"Rodomont took, as often has been said."
39806,XXX,"The valiant Olivier was of the set,"
39807,XXX,"Orlando's kin, and, with them, prisoners led,"
39808,XXX,"Were faithful Brandimart and Sansonet,"
39809,XXX,With more; to tell whereof there is no need;
39810,XXX,"Of German, Gascon, or Italian seed."
39811,XXX,
39812,XXXI,XXXI
39813,XXXI,"The patron, yet unweeting he should find"
39814,XXXI,"Foes in the port, here entered to unload;"
39815,XXXI,"Having left Argier many miles behind,"
39816,XXXI,Where he was minded to have made abode;
39817,XXXI,"Because a boisterous, overblowing, wind"
39818,XXXI,Had driven his bark beyond her destined road;
39819,XXXI,"Deeming himself as safe and welcome guest,"
39820,XXXI,"As Progne, when she seeks her noisy nest."
39821,XXXI,
39822,XXXII,XXXII
39823,XXXII,"But when, arrived, the imperial eagle spread,"
39824,XXXII,"And pards and golden lilies he descries,"
39825,XXXII,"With countenance as sicklied o'er by dread,"
39826,XXXII,"He stands, as one that in unwary guise,"
39827,XXXII,"Has chanced on fell and poisonous snake to tread,"
39828,XXXII,"Which, in the grass, opprest with slumber lies;"
39829,XXXII,"And, pale and startled, hastens to retire"
39830,XXXII,"From that ill reptile, swoln with bane and ire."
39831,XXXII,
39832,XXXIII,XXXIII
39833,XXXIII,"But no retreat from peril is there here,"
39834,XXXIII,Nor can the patron keep his prisoners down:
39835,XXXIII,"Him thither Brandimart and Olivier,"
39836,XXXIII,"Sansonet and those others drag, where known"
39837,XXXIII,"And greeted are the friends with joyful cheer,"
39838,XXXIII,By England's duke and Danish Ogier's son;
39839,XXXIII,Who read that he who brought them to that shore
39840,XXXIII,Should for his pains be sentenced to the oar.
39841,XXXIII,
39842,XXXIV,XXXIV
39843,XXXIV,King Otho's son kind welcome did afford
39844,XXXIV,"Unto those Christian cavaliers, as said:"
39845,XXXIV,Who -- honoured at his hospitable board --
39846,XXXIV,With arms and all things needful were purveyed.
39847,XXXIV,"His going, for their sake, the Danish lord"
39848,XXXIV,"Deferred, who deemed his voyage well delayed,"
39849,XXXIV,"To parley with those peers, though at the cost"
39850,XXXIV,"Of one or two good days, in harbour lost."
39851,XXXIV,
39852,XXXV,XXXV
39853,XXXV,"Of Charles, and in what state, what order are"
39854,XXXV,The affairs of France they gave advices true;
39855,XXXV,"Told where he best could disembark, and where"
39856,XXXV,To most advantage of the Christian crew.
39857,XXXV,"While so the cavaliers their news declare,"
39858,XXXV,"A noise is heard; which ever louder grew,"
39859,XXXV,"Followed by such a fierce alarm withal,"
39860,XXXV,As to more fears than one gave rise in all.
39861,XXXV,
39862,XXXVI,XXXVI
39863,XXXVI,"The duke Astolpho and the goodly throng,"
39864,XXXVI,"That in discourse with him were occupied,"
39865,XXXVI,"Armed in a moment, on their coursers sprung,"
39866,XXXVI,And hurried where the Nubians loudest cried;
39867,XXXVI,"And seeking wherefore that wide larum rung,"
39868,XXXVI,"Now here, now there -- those warlike lords espied"
39869,XXXVI,"A savage man, and one so strong of hand,"
39870,XXXVI,Naked and sole he troubled all that band.
39871,XXXVI,
39872,XXXVII,XXXVII
39873,XXXVII,"The naked savage whirled a sapling round,"
39874,XXXVII,"So hard, so heavy, and so strong of grain,"
39875,XXXVII,"That every time the weapon went to ground,"
39876,XXXVII,"Some warrior, more than maimed, opprest the plain."
39877,XXXVII,Above a hundred dead are strewed around;
39878,XXXVII,Nor more defence the routed hands maintain;
39879,XXXVII,Save that a war of distant parts they try;
39880,XXXVII,For there is none will wait the champion nigh.
39881,XXXVII,
39882,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
39883,XXXVIII,"Astolpho, Brandimart, the Danish knight,"
39884,XXXVIII,"Hastening towards that noise with Olivier,"
39885,XXXVIII,Remain astounded at the wondrous might
39886,XXXVIII,"And courage, which in that wild man appear."
39887,XXXVIII,"When, posting thither on a palfry light,"
39888,XXXVIII,"Is seen a damsel, clad in sable gear."
39889,XXXVIII,"To Brandimart in haste that lady goes,"
39890,XXXVIII,And both her arms about the warrior throws.
39891,XXXVIII,
39892,XXXIX,XXXIX
39893,XXXIX,"This was fair Flordelice, whose bosom so"
39894,XXXIX,"Burned with the love of Monodantes' son,"
39895,XXXIX,"She, when she left him prisoner to his foe"
39896,XXXIX,"At that streight bridge, had nigh distracted gone."
39897,XXXIX,From France had she past hither -- given to know --
39898,XXXIX,"By that proud paynim, who the deed had done,"
39899,XXXIX,"How Brandimart, with many cavaliers,"
39900,XXXIX,Was prisoner in the city of Algiers.
39901,XXXIX,
39902,XL,XL
39903,XL,"When now she for that harbour would have weighed,"
39904,XL,"An eastern vessel in Marseilles she found,"
39905,XL,Which thither had an ancient knight conveyed:
39906,XL,Of Monodantes' household; a long round
39907,XL,"To seek his Brandimart that lord had made,"
39908,XL,"By sea, and upon many a distant ground."
39909,XL,"For he, upon his way, had heard it told,"
39910,XL,How he in France should find the warrior bold.
39911,XL,
39912,XLI,XLI
39913,XLI,"She knowing old Bardino in that wight,"
39914,XLI,Bardino who from Monodantes' court
39915,XLI,"With little Brandimart had taken flight,"
39916,XLI,And reared his nursling in THE SYLVAN FORT;
39917,XLI,"Then hearing what had thither brought the knight,"
39918,XLI,With her had made him loosen from the port;
39919,XLI,"Relating to that elder, by what chance"
39920,XLI,Brandimart had to Africk passed from France.
39921,XLI,
39922,XLII,XLII
39923,XLII,"As soon as landed, that Biserta lies"
39924,XLII,"Besieged by good Astolpho's band, they hear;"
39925,XLII,"That Brandimart is with him in the emprize,"
39926,XLII,"They learn, but learn not as a matter clear."
39927,XLII,"Now in such haste to him the damsel flies,"
39928,XLII,"When she beholds her faithful cavalier,"
39929,XLII,As plainly shows her joy; which woes o'erblown
39930,XLII,Had made the mightiest she had ever known.
39931,XLII,
39932,XLIII,XLIII
39933,XLIII,The gentle baron no less gladly eyed
39934,XLIII,His faithful and beloved consort's face;
39935,XLIII,Her whom he prized above all things beside;
39936,XLIII,And clipt and welcomed her with loving grace;
39937,XLIII,Nor his warm wishes would have satisfied
39938,XLIII,"A first, a second, or a third embrace,"
39939,XLIII,"But that he spied Bardino, he that came"
39940,XLIII,"From France, together with that faithful dame."
39941,XLIII,
39942,XLIV,XLIV
39943,XLIV,"He stretched his arms, and would embrace the knight;"
39944,XLIV,And -- wherefore he was come -- would bid him say:
39945,XLIV,But was prevented by the sudden flight
39946,XLIV,"Of the sacred host, which fled in disarray,"
39947,XLIV,"Before the club of that mad, naked wight,"
39948,XLIV,Who with the brandished sapling cleared his way.
39949,XLIV,Flordelice viewed the furious man in front;
39950,XLIV,"And cried to Brandimart, ""Behold the count!"""
39951,XLIV,
39952,XLV,XLV
39953,XLV,"At the same time, withal, Astolpho bold"
39954,XLV,"That this was good Orlando plainly knew,"
39955,XLV,"By signs, whereof those ancient saints had told,"
39956,XLV,"In the earthly paradise, as tokens true."
39957,XLV,"None of those others, who the knight behold,"
39958,XLV,The courteous baron in the madman view;
39959,XLV,"That from long self-neglect, while wild he ran,"
39960,XLV,Had in his visage more of beast than man.
39961,XLV,
39962,XLVI,XLVI
39963,XLVI,"With breast and heart transfixed with pity, cried"
39964,XLVI,Valiant Astolpho -- bathed with many a tear --
39965,XLVI,"Turning to Danish Dudon, at this side,"
39966,XLVI,And afterwards to valiant Olivier;
39967,XLVI,"""Behold Orlando!""  Him awhile they eyed,"
39968,XLVI,Straining their eyes and lids; then knew the peer;
39969,XLVI,"And, seeing him in such a piteous plight,"
39970,XLVI,Were filled with grief and wonder at the sight.
39971,XLVI,
39972,XLVII,XLVII
39973,XLVII,So grieve and so lament the greater part
39974,XLVII,"Of those good warriors, that their eyes o'erflow."
39975,XLVII,""" `Tis time"" (Astolpho cried) ""to find some art"
39976,XLVII,"To heal him, not indulge in useless woe"";"
39977,XLVII,"And from his courser sprang: bold Brandimart,"
39978,XLVII,"Olivier, Sansonet and Dudon so"
39979,XLVII,"All leap to ground, and all together make"
39980,XLVII,"At Roland, whom the warriors fain would take."
39981,XLVII,
39982,XLVIII,XLVIII
39983,XLVIII,"Seeing the circle round about him grow,"
39984,XLVIII,"Levels his club that furious paladin,"
39985,XLVIII,And makes fierce Dudon feel (who -- couched below
39986,XLVIII,His buckler -- on the madman would break in)
39987,XLVIII,How grievous is that staff's descending blow;
39988,XLVIII,"And but that Olivier, Orlando's kin,"
39989,XLVIII,"Broke in some sort its force, that stake accurst"
39990,XLVIII,"Had shield and helmet, head and body burst."
39991,XLVIII,
39992,XLIX,XLIX
39993,XLIX,"It only burst the shield, and in such thunder"
39994,XLIX,"Broke on the casque, that Dudon prest the shore:"
39995,XLIX,"With that, Sir Sansonet cut clean asunder"
39996,XLIX,"The sapling, shorn of two cloth-yards and more,"
39997,XLIX,"So vigorous was that warrior's stroke, while under"
39998,XLIX,"His bosom, Brandimart girt Roland sore"
39999,XLIX,With sinewy arms about his body flung;
40000,XLIX,And to the champion's legs Astolpho clung.
40001,XLIX,
40002,L,L
40003,L,"Orlando shook himself, and England's knight,"
40004,L,"Ten paces off, reversed upon the ground;"
40005,L,"Yet loosed not Brandimart, who with more might"
40006,L,And better hold had clasped the madman round.
40007,L,"To Olivier, too forward in that fight,"
40008,L,"He dealt so furious and so fell a wound,"
40009,L,"With his clenched fist, that pale the marquis fell;"
40010,L,And purple streams from eyes and nostrils well;
40011,L,
40012,LI,LI
40013,LI,"And save his morion had been more than good,"
40014,LI,"Bold Olivier had breathed his last, who lies,"
40015,LI,"So battered with his fall, it seemed he wou'd"
40016,LI,Bequeath his parting soul to paradise.
40017,LI,"Astolpho and Dudon, that again upstood"
40018,LI,(Albeit swoln were Dudon's face and eyes)
40019,LI,"And Sansonet, who plied so well his sword,"
40020,LI,All made together at Anglantes' lord.
40021,LI,
40022,LII,LII
40023,LII,"Dudon Orlando from behind embraced,"
40024,LII,And with his foot the furious peer would throw:
40025,LII,Astolpho and others seize his arms; but waste
40026,LII,Their strength in all attempts to hold the foe.
40027,LII,"He who has seen a bull, by mastiffs chased"
40028,LII,"That gore his bleeding ears, in fury lowe,"
40029,LII,"Dragging the dogs that bait him there and here,"
40030,LII,Yet from their tusks unable to get clear;
40031,LII,
40032,LIII,LIII
40033,LIII,"Let him imagine, so Orlando drew"
40034,LIII,Astolpho and those banded knights along.
40035,LIII,"Meanwhile upstarted Oliviero, who"
40036,LIII,By that fell fistycuff on earth was flung;
40037,LIII,"And, seeing they could ill by Roland do"
40038,LIII,"That sought by good Astolpho and his throng,"
40039,LIII,"He meditates, and compasses, a way"
40040,LIII,The frantic paladin on earth to lay.
40041,LIII,
40042,LIV,LIV
40043,LIV,"He many a hawser made them thither bring,"
40044,LIV,And running knots in them he quickly tied;
40045,LIV,"Which on the count's waist, arms, and legs, they fling;"
40046,LIV,"And then, among themselves, the ends divide,"
40047,LIV,"Conveyed to this or that amid the ring,"
40048,LIV,Compassing Roland upon every side.
40049,LIV,"The warriors thus Orlando flung parforce,"
40050,LIV,As farrier throws the struggling ox or horse.
40051,LIV,
40052,LV,LV
40053,LV,"As soon as down, they all upon him are,"
40054,LV,And hands and feet more tightly they constrain:
40055,LV,"He shakes himself, and plunges here and there;"
40056,LV,But all his efforts for relief are vain.
40057,LV,Astolpho bade them hence the prisoner bear;
40058,LV,For he would heal (he said) the warrior's brain.
40059,LV,"Shouldered by sturdy Dudon is the load,"
40060,LV,And on the beach's furthest brink bestowed.
40061,LV,
40062,LVI,LVI
40063,LVI,Seven times Astolpho makes them wash the knight;
40064,LVI,And seven times plunged beneath the brine he goes.
40065,LVI,"So that they cleanse away the scurf and blight,"
40066,LVI,Which to his stupid limbs and visage grows.
40067,LVI,"This done, with herbs, for that occasion dight,"
40068,LVI,"They stop his mouth, wherewith he puffs and blows."
40069,LVI,"For, save his nostrils, would Astolpho leave"
40070,LVI,No passage whence the count might air receive.
40071,LVI,
40072,LVII,LVII
40073,LVII,"Valiant Astolpho had prepared the vase,"
40074,LVII,"Wherein Orlando's senses were contained,"
40075,LVII,"And to his nostrils in such mode conveys,"
40076,LVII,"That, drawing-in his breath, the county drained"
40077,LVII,The mystic cup withal.  Oh wondrous case!
40078,LVII,The unsettled mind its ancient seat regained;
40079,LVII,"And, in its glorious reasonings, yet more clear"
40080,LVII,And lucid waxed his wisdom than whilere.
40081,LVII,
40082,LVIII,LVIII
40083,LVIII,"As one, that seems in troubled sleep to see"
40084,LVIII,"Abominable shapes, a horrid crew;"
40085,LVIII,"Monsters which are not, and which cannot be;"
40086,LVIII,"Or seems some strange, unlawful thing to do,"
40087,LVIII,"Yet marvels at himself, from slumber free."
40088,LVIII,When his recovered senses play him true;
40089,LVIII,"So good Orlando, when he is made sound,"
40090,LVIII,"Remains yet full of wonder, and astound."
40091,LVIII,
40092,LIX,LIX
40093,LIX,"Aldabelle's brother, Monodantes' son,"
40094,LIX,"And him that on his brain such cure had wrought,"
40095,LIX,"He wondering marked, but word he spake to none;"
40096,LIX,"And when and how he was brought thither, thought."
40097,LIX,"He turned his restless eyes now up now down,"
40098,LIX,"Nor where he was withal, imagined aught,"
40099,LIX,"Marvelling why he there was naked cast,"
40100,LIX,"And wherefore tethered, neck and heels, so fast."
40101,LIX,
40102,LX,LX
40103,LX,"Then said, as erst Silenus said -- when seen,"
40104,LX,And taken sleeping the cave of yore --
40105,LX,"SOLVITE ME, with visage so serene,"
40106,LX,"With look so much less wayward than before,"
40107,LX,"That him they from his bonds delivered clean,"
40108,LX,And raiment to the naked warrior bore;
40109,LX,"All comforting their friend, with grief opprest"
40110,LX,For that delusion which had him possest.
40111,LX,
40112,LXI,LXI
40113,LXI,"When to his former self he was recovered,"
40114,LXI,"Of wiser and of manlier mind than e'er,"
40115,LXI,From love as well was freed the enamoured lord;
40116,LXI,"And she, so gentle deemed, so fair whilere,"
40117,LXI,"And by renowned Orlando so adored,"
40118,LXI,Did but to him a worthless thing appear.
40119,LXI,"What he through love had lost, to reacquire"
40120,LXI,"Was his whole study, was his whole desire."
40121,LXI,
40122,LXII,LXII
40123,LXII,"Meanwhile Bardino told to Brandimart,"
40124,LXII,"How Monodantes, his good sire, was dead,"
40125,LXII,"And, on his brother, Gigliantes' part,"
40126,LXII,"To call him to his kingdom had he sped,"
40127,LXII,"As well as from those isles, which most apart"
40128,LXII,"From other lands, in eastern seas are spread,"
40129,LXII,That prince's fair inheritance; than which
40130,LXII,"Was none more pleasant, populous, or rich."
40131,LXII,
40132,LXIII,LXIII
40133,LXIII,"He said, mid many reasons which he prest,"
40134,LXIII,"That home was sweet, and -- were the warrior fain"
40135,LXIII,To taste that sweet -- he ever would detest
40136,LXIII,A wandering life; and Brandimart again
40137,LXIII,"Replies, through all that war, he will not rest"
40138,LXIII,From serving Roland and King Charlemagne;
40139,LXIII,"And after, if he lives to see its end,"
40140,LXIII,To his own matters better will attend.

40143,LXIV,"Upon the following day, for Provence steer"
40144,LXIV,The shipping under Danish Dudon's care;
40145,LXIV,"When with the duke retired Anglantes' peer,"
40146,LXIV,And heard that lord the warfare's state declare:
40147,LXIV,"Then prest with siege Biserta, far and near,"
40148,LXIV,But let good England's knight the honour wear
40149,LXIV,Of every vantage; while Astolpho still
40150,LXIV,In all was guided by Orlando's will.
40151,LXIV,
40152,LXV,LXV
40153,LXV,The order taken to attack the town
40154,LXV,"Of huge Biserta, when, and on what side;"
40155,LXV,"How, at the first assault, the walls are won,"
40156,LXV,"And with Orlando who the palm divide,"
40157,LXV,"Lament not that I now shall leave unshown,"
40158,LXV,Since for short time I lay my tale aside.
40159,LXV,"In the meanwhile, how fierce an overthrow"
40160,LXV,"The Moors received in France, be pleased to know."
40161,LXV,
40162,LXVI,LXVI
40163,LXVI,Well nigh abandoned was their royal lord
40164,LXVI,In his worst peril; for to Arles again
40165,LXVI,"Had gone, with many of the paynim horde,"
40166,LXVI,The sage Sobrino and the king of Spain;
40167,LXVI,"Who, for the deemed the land unsafe, aboard"
40168,LXVI,"Their barks sought refuge, with a numerous train,"
40169,LXVI,"Barons and cavaliers, that served the Moor;"
40170,LXVI,Who moved by their example put from shore.
40171,LXVI,
40172,LXVII,LXVII
40173,LXVII,Yet royal Agramant the fight maintains;
40174,LXVII,"But when he can no longer make a stand,"
40175,LXVII,"Turns from the combat, and directly strains"
40176,LXVII,"For Arles, not far remote, upon the strand."
40177,LXVII,"Him Rabican pursues, with flowing reins,"
40178,LXVII,Whom Aymon's daughter drives with heel and hand.
40179,LXVII,"Him would she slay, through whom so often crost,"
40180,LXVII,That martial maid had her Rogero lost.
40181,LXVII,
40182,LXVIII,LXVIII
40183,LXVIII,"Marphisa by the same desire was stirred,"
40184,LXVIII,"Who had her thoughts on tardy vengeance placed,"
40185,LXVIII,"For her dead sire; and as she fiercely spurred,"
40186,LXVIII,Made her hot courser feel his rider's haste.
40187,LXVIII,"But neither martial maid, amid that herd"
40188,LXVIII,"Of flying Moors, so well the monarch chased,"
40189,LXVIII,"As to o'ertake him in his swift retreat,"
40190,LXVIII,"First into Arles, and then aboard his fleet."
40191,LXVIII,
40192,LXIX,LXIX
40193,LXIX,"As two fair generous pards, that from some crag"

40206,LXX,Many that never more uprear their head.
40207,LXX,To evil pass was brought the broken foe;
40208,LXX,For safety was not even for them that fled:
40209,LXX,"Since Agramant, a sure retreat to gain,"
40210,LXX,Bade shut the city-gate which faced the plain;
40211,LXX,
40212,LXXI,LXXI

40611,XXIII,"Nor was there one who marked, nor one who thought"
40612,XXIII,"Of marking, if such weight it would abide."
40613,XXIII,"Brandimart only, on the foes intent,"

40631,XXV,"Of many prayed, the warrior would not hear"
40632,XXV,The prayer to turn; but mid the foes leapt down;
40633,XXV,"I say, into the city took a leap,"
40634,XXV,Where the town-wall was thirty cubits deep.
40635,XXV,
40636,XXVI,XXVI
40637,XXVI,"He, without any harm on the hard ground,"
40638,XXVI,"As if on feathers or on straw, did light;"
40639,XXVI,"And, like cloth shred and shorn, the paynims round"
40640,XXVI,In fury shreds and shears the valiant knight.
40641,XXVI,"Now springs on these, now those, with vigorous bound;"
40642,XXVI,And these and those betake themselves to flight.
40643,XXVI,"They that without have seen the leap he made,"

40647,XXVII,"Throughout the squadrons a deep rumour flew,"
40648,XXVII,"A murmur and a whisper, there and here,"
40649,XXVII,"From mouth to mouth, the Fame by motion grew,"
40650,XXVII,And told and magnified the tale of fear:
40651,XXVII,"For upon many quarters stormed that crew,"
40652,XXVII,"Where good Orlando was, where Olivier,"
40653,XXVII,"Where Otho's son, she flew on pinions light,"
40654,XXVII,Nor ever paused upon her nimble flight.

40660,XXVIII,"They would from so renowned a comrade part,"
40661,XXVIII,"Their scaling-ladders plant, and mount the wall"
40662,XXVIII,"With rivalry, which shows the kingly heart;"
40663,XXVIII,"Who carry all such terror in their look,"
40664,XXVIII,"That, at the very sight, their foemen shook."
40665,XXVIII,
40666,XXIX,XXIX
40667,XXIX,"As on loud ocean, lashed by boisterous gale"
40668,XXIX,"The billows the rash bark assault, and still --"
40669,XXIX,"Now threatening poop, now threatening prow -- assail,"
40670,XXIX,"And, in their rage and fury, fain would fill;"
40671,XXIX,"The pilot sighs and groans, dismaid and pale,"
40672,XXIX,"-- He that should aid, and has not heart or skill --"
40673,XXIX,"At length a surge the pinnace sweeps and swallows,"

40678,XXX,"So wide, that who beneath their conduct go,"

40680,XXX,A thousand ladders have been reared below.
40681,XXX,"Meanwhile the battering rams, in many a place,"
40682,XXX,"Have breached that wall, and with such mighty blow,"
40683,XXX,"The bold assailant can, from many a part,"

40697,XXXII,"Even with that rage rushed in the impetuous band,"
40698,XXXII,"Where many breaches in the wall were wrought,"
40699,XXXII,"To slay with burning torch and trenchant brand,"
40700,XXXII,"That people, which to evil pass were brought."

40708,XXXIII,"Blood issued from so many a gaping wound,"
40709,XXXIII,A fouler fosse was formed and worse to ford
40710,XXXIII,Than girdles the infernal city round.
40711,XXXIII,From house to house the fire in fury poured;
40712,XXXIII,"Mosque, portico, and palace, went to ground;"
40713,XXXIII,"And spoiled and empty mansions with the clang,"

40730,XXXV,Branzardo slew himself with his own brand;
40731,XXXV,"Pierced with three wounds whereof he shortly died,"
40732,XXXV,Folvo was taken by Astolpho's hand;

41012,LXIII,That he might aid his comrades now in flight.
41013,LXIII,Rogero backed the steed and grasped the sword;
41014,LXIII,But not in battle mixed that martial lord.
41015,LXIII,
41016,LXIV,LXIV
41017,LXIV,Thence he departed; but he first renewed
41018,LXIV,His compact with Montalban's knight -- that so
41019,LXIV,His Agramant convinced of perjury stood --
41020,LXIV,Him and his evil sect he would forego.
41021,LXIV,That day no further feats of hardihood
41022,LXIV,Rogero will perform against the foe:
41023,LXIV,"He but demands of all that make for Arles,"
41024,LXIV,"Who first broke faith, King Agramant or Charles?"
41025,LXIV,
41026,LXV,LXV
41027,LXV,"From all he hears repeated, far and near,"
41028,LXV,That Agramant had broke the promise plight:
41029,LXV,"He loves that king, and from his side to veer,"
41030,LXV,"For this, believes would be no error light."
41031,LXV,The Moors were broke and scattered (this whilere
41032,LXV,Has been rehearsed) and from the giddy height
41033,LXV,"Of HER revolving wheel were downward hurled,"
41034,LXV,Who at her pleasure rolls this nether world.
41035,LXV,
41036,LXVI,LXVI
41037,LXVI,"Rogero ponders if he should remain,"
41038,LXVI,Or rather should his sovereign lord attend:
41039,LXVI,Love for his lady fits him with a rein
41040,LXVI,"And bit, which lets him not to Africk wend;"
41041,LXVI,"Wheels him, and to a counter course again"
41042,LXVI,"Spurs him, and threats his restive mood to shend,"
41043,LXVI,"Save he maintains the treaty, and the troth"
41044,LXVI,Pledged to the paladin with solemn oath.
41045,LXVI,
41046,LXVII,LXVII
41047,LXVII,"A wakeful, stinging care, on the other side"
41048,LXVII,Scourges and goads no less the cavalier;
41049,LXVII,"Lest, if he now from Agramant divide,"
41050,LXVII,He should be taxed with baseness or with fear.
41051,LXVII,"If many deem it well he should abide,"
41052,LXVII,To many and many it would ill appear:
41053,LXVII,"Many would say, that oaths unbinding are,"
41054,LXVII,Which 'tis unlawful and unjust to swear.
41055,LXVII,
41056,LXVIII,LXVIII
41057,LXVIII,He all that day and the ensuing night
41058,LXVIII,"Remains alone, and so the following day;"
41059,LXVIII,"Forever sifting in his doubtful sprite,"
41060,LXVIII,If it be better to depart or stay:
41061,LXVIII,Lastly for Agramant decides the knight;
41062,LXVIII,To him in Africk will he wend his way:
41063,LXVIII,"Moved by his love for his liege-lady sore,"
41064,LXVIII,But moved by honour and by duty more.
41065,LXVIII,
41066,LXIX,LXIX
41067,LXIX,"He made for Arles, where yet he hoped would ride"
41068,LXIX,The fleet which him to Africa might bear;
41069,LXIX,"Nor in the port nor offing ships espied,"
41070,LXIX,Nor Saracens save dead beheld he there.
41071,LXIX,"For Agramant had swept the roadstead wide,"
41072,LXIX,And burnt what vessels in the haven were.
41073,LXIX,"Rogero takes the road, when his hope fails,"
41074,LXIX,Along the sea-beat shore toward Marseilles.
41075,LXIX,
41076,LXX,LXX
41077,LXX,"Upon some boat he hoped to lay his hand,"
41078,LXX,Which him for love or force should thence convey.
41079,LXX,"Already Ogier's son had made the land,"
41080,LXX,"With the barbarians' fleet, his captive prey."
41081,LXX,You could not there have cast a grain of sand
41082,LXX,Between those vessels; moored closely lay
41083,LXX,"The mighty squadrons to that harbour brought,"
41084,LXX,"With conquerors these, and those with prisoners fraught."
41085,LXX,
41086,LXXI,LXXI
41087,LXXI,The vessels of the Moor that were not made
41088,LXXI,The food of fire and water on that night
41089,LXXI,(Saving some few that fled) were all conveyed
41090,LXXI,Safe to Marseilles by the victorious knight
41091,LXXI,"Seven of those kings, that Moorish sceptres swayed,"
41092,LXXI,"Who, having seen their squadron put to flight,"
41093,LXXI,"With their seven ships had yielded to the foe,"
41094,LXXI,"Stood mute and weeping, overwhelmed with woe."
41095,LXXI,
41096,LXXII,LXXII
41097,LXXII,"Dudon had issued forth upon dry land,"
41098,LXXII,Bent to find Charlemagne that very day;
41099,LXXII,And of the Moorish spoil and captive band
41100,LXXII,Made in triumphal pomp a long display.
41101,LXXII,"The prisoners all were ranged upon the strand,"
41102,LXXII,And round them stood their Nubian victors gay;
41103,LXXII,"Who, shouting in his praise, with loud acclaim,"
41104,LXXII,Made all that region ring with Dudon's name.
41105,LXXII,
41106,LXXIII,LXXIII
41107,LXXIII,"Rogero, when from far the ships he spied,"
41108,LXXIII,"Believed they were the fleet of Agramant,"
41109,LXXIII,"And, to know further, pricked his courser's side;"
41110,LXXIII,"Then, nearer, mid those knights of mickle vaunt,"
41111,LXXIII,"Nasamon's king a prisoner he desired,"
41112,LXXIII,"Agricalt, Bambirago, Farurant,"
41113,LXXIII,"Balastro, Manilardo, and Rimedont;"
41114,LXXIII,Who stood with weeping eyes and drooping front.
41115,LXXIII,
41116,LXXIV,LXXIV
41117,LXXIV,In their unhappy state to leave that crew
41118,LXXIV,"The Child, who loved those monarchs, cannot bear;"
41119,LXXIV,That useless is the empty hand he knew;
41120,LXXIV,"That where force is not, little profits prayer."
41121,LXXIV,"He couched his lance, their keeper overthrew,"
41122,LXXIV,Then proved his wonted might with faulchion bare;
41123,LXXIV,And in a moment stretched upon the strand
41124,LXXIV,Above a hundred of the Nubian band.
41125,LXXIV,
41126,LXXV,LXXV
41127,LXXV,"The noise Sir Dudon hears, the slaughter spies,"
41128,LXXV,But knows not who the stranger cavalier:
41129,LXXV,"He marks how, put to rout, his people flies;"
41130,LXXV,"With anguish, with lament and mighty fear;"
41131,LXXV,"Quickly for courser, shield, and helmet cries,"
41132,LXXV,"(Bosom, and arms, and thighs, were mailed whilere)"
41133,LXXV,"Leaps on his horse, nor -- having seized his lance --"
41134,LXXV,Forgets he is a paladin of France.
41135,LXXV,
41136,LXXVI,LXXVI
41137,LXXVI,"He called on every one to stand aside,"
41138,LXXVI,And with the galling spur his courser prest;
41139,LXXVI,"Meanwhile a hundred other foes have died,"
41140,LXXVI,And filled with hope was every prisoner's breast;
41141,LXXVI,And as Rogero holy Dudon spied
41142,LXXVI,"Approach on horseback, (footmen were the rest,)"
41143,LXXVI,"Esteeming him their head, he charged the knight,"
41144,LXXVI,Impelled by huge desire to prove his might.
41145,LXXVI,
41146,LXXVII,LXXVII
41147,LXXVII,"Already, on his part, had moved the Dane;"
41148,LXXVII,"But when he saw the Child without a spear,"
41149,LXXVII,"He flang is own far from him, in disdain"
41150,LXXVII,To take such vantage of the cavalier.
41151,LXXVII,"Admiring at Sir Dudon's courteous vein,"
41152,LXXVII,"""Belie himself he cannot,"" said the peer,"
41153,LXXVII,"""And of those perfect warriors must be one"
41154,LXXVII,That as the paladins of France are known.
41155,LXXVII,
41156,LXXVIII,LXXVIII
41157,LXXVIII,"""If I my will can compass, he shall shew"
41158,LXXVIII,"His name, to me, ere further deed be done."""
41159,LXXVIII,He made demand; and in the stranger knew
41160,LXXVIII,"Dudon, the Danish Ogier's valiant son:"
41161,LXXVIII,"He from Rogero claimed an equal due,"
41162,LXXVIII,And from the Child as courteous answer won.
41163,LXXVIII,-- Their names on either side announced -- the foes
41164,LXXVIII,"A bold defiance speak, and come to blows."
41165,LXXVIII,
41166,LXXIX,LXXIX
41167,LXXIX,"Bold Dudon had with him that iron mace,"
41168,LXXIX,Which won him deathless fame in many a fight:
41169,LXXIX,Wherewith he proved him fully of the race
41170,LXXIX,"Of that good Danish warrior, famed for might."
41171,LXXIX,"That best of faulchions, which through iron case"
41172,LXXIX,"Of cuirass or of casque was wont to bite,"
41173,LXXIX,"Youthful Rogero from the scabbard snatched,"
41174,LXXIX,And with the martial Dane his valour matched.

41201,LXXXII,"He often dazzles so the warrior's eyes,"

41380,XVII,XVII
41381,XVII,Three times and four the pale-faced pilot wrought
41382,XVII,The tiller with a vigorous push to sway;

41422,XXI,"Some rise, and bounding with the billows go:"
41423,XXI,"Their course, with head uplifted, others steer;"
41424,XXI,"An arm, an unshod leg, those others show:"
41425,XXI,"Rogero, who the tempest will not fear,"
41426,XXI,Springs upward to the surface from below;
41427,XXI,"And little distant sees that rock, in vain"
41428,XXI,Eschewed by him and his attendant train.
41429,XXI,
41430,XXII,XXII
41431,XXII,"Himself with hands and feet the warrior rows,"
41432,XXII,Hoping by force thereof to win the shore;
41433,XXII,"Breast boldly the importunate flood, and blows"
41434,XXII,With his unwearied breath the foam before.
41435,XXII,"Waxing meanwhile, the troubled water rose,"
41436,XXII,And from the rock the abandoned vessel bore;
41437,XXII,"Quitted of those unhappy men, who die"
41438,XXII,(So curst their lot) the death from which they fly.
41439,XXII,
41440,XXIII,XXIII
41441,XXIII,Alas!  for man's deceitful thoughts and blind!
41442,XXIII,"The ship escaped from wreck, where hope was none;"
41443,XXIII,"When master and when men their charge resigned,"
41444,XXIII,And let the vessel without guidance run.
41445,XXIII,"It would appear the wind has changed its mind,"
41446,XXIII,On seeing all that sailed in her are gone;
41447,XXIII,"And blows the vessel from those shallows free,"
41448,XXIII,"Through better course, into a safer sea."
41449,XXIII,
41450,XXIV,XXIV
41451,XXIV,"She, having drifted wildly with her guide,"
41452,XXIV,"Without him, made directly Africk's strand,"
41453,XXIV,"Two or three miles of waste Biserta wide,"
41454,XXIV,Upon the quarter facing Egypt's land;
41455,XXIV,"And, as the sea went down and the wind died,"
41456,XXIV,Stood bedded in that weary waste of sand.
41457,XXIV,"Now thither Roland roved, who paced the shore;"
41458,XXIV,As I in other strain rehearsed before;
41459,XXIV,
41460,XXV,XXV
41461,XXV,"And willing to discover if alone,"
41462,XXV,"Laden, or light, the stranded vessel were,"
41463,XXV,"He, Olivier, and Monodantes' son,"
41464,XXV,Aboard her in a shallow bark repair:
41465,XXV,"Beneath the hatchways they descend, but none"
41466,XXV,Of human kind they see; and only there
41467,XXV,"Find good Frontino, with the trenchant sword"
41468,XXV,And gallant armour of his youthful lord;
41469,XXV,
41470,XXVI,XXVI
41471,XXVI,Who was so hurried in his hasty flight
41472,XXVI,He had not even time to take his sword;
41473,XXVI,"To Orlando known; which, Balisardo hight,"
41474,XXVI,"Was his erewhile; the tale's upon record,"
41475,XXVI,"And ye have read it all, as well I wite;"
41476,XXVI,"How Falerina lost it to that lord,"
41477,XXVI,When waste as well her beauteous bowers he laid;
41478,XXVI,And how from him Brunello stole the blade;
41479,XXVI,
41480,XXVII,XXVII
41481,XXVII,"And how beneath Carena, on the plain"
41482,XXVII,Brunello on Rogero this bestowed.
41483,XXVII,"How matchless was that faulchion's edge and grain,"
41484,XXVII,To him experience had already showed;
41485,XXVII,"I say, Orlando; who was therefore fain,"
41486,XXVII,And to heaven's king with grateful thanks o'erflowed;
41487,XXVII,"And deemed, and often afterwards so said,"
41488,XXVII,Heaven for such pressing need had sent the blade:
41489,XXVII,
41490,XXVIII,XXVIII
41491,XXVIII,"Such pressing need, in that he had to fight"
41492,XXVIII,With the redoubted king of Sericane;
41493,XXVIII,"And knew that he, besides his fearful might,"
41494,XXVIII,Was lord of Bayard and of Durindane.
41495,XXVIII,"Not knowing them, Anglantes' valiant knight"
41496,XXVIII,So highly rated not the plate and chain
41497,XXVIII,"As he that these had proved: they valour were,"
41498,XXVIII,But valued less as good than rich and fair;
41499,XXVIII,
41500,XXIX,XXIX
41501,XXIX,"And, for of harness he had little need,"
41502,XXIX,"Charmed, and against all weapons fortified,"
41503,XXIX,To Olivier he left the warlike weed:
41504,XXIX,Not so the sword; which to his waist he tied:
41505,XXIX,To Brandimart Orlando gave the steed:
41506,XXIX,Thus equally that spoil would he divide
41507,XXIX,"With his companions twain, in equal share,"
41508,XXIX,Who partners in that rich discovery were.
41509,XXIX,
41510,XXX,XXX
41511,XXX,"Against the day of fight, in goodly gear"
41512,XXX,"And new, those warriors seek their limbs to deck."
41513,XXX,Blazoned upon Orlando's shield appear
41514,XXX,The burning bold and lofty Babel's wreck.
41515,XXX,"A lyme-dog argent bears Sir Olivier,"
41516,XXX,"Couchant, and with the leash upon his neck:"
41517,XXX,The motto; TILL HE COMES: In gilded vest
41518,XXX,And worthy of himself he will be drest.
41519,XXX,
41520,XXXI,XXXI
41521,XXXI,Bold Brandimart designed upon the day
41522,XXXI,"Of battle, for his royal father's sake,"
41523,XXXI,"And his own honour, no device more gay"
41524,XXXI,Than a dim surcoat to the field to take.
41525,XXXI,"By gentle Flordelice for that dark array,"
41526,XXXI,Was wrought the fairest facing she could make.
41527,XXXI,With costly jewels was the border sown;
41528,XXXI,"Sable the vest, and of one piece alone."
41529,XXXI,
41530,XXXII,XXXII
41531,XXXII,"With her own hand the lady wrought that vest,"
41532,XXXII,"Becoming well the finest plate and chain,"
41533,XXXII,"Wherein the valiant warrior should be drest,"
41534,XXXII,And cloak his courser's croup and chest and mane:
41535,XXXII,"But, from that day when she herself addrest"
41536,XXXII,"Unto this task, till ended was her pain,"
41537,XXXII,"She showed no sign of gladness; nor this while,"
41538,XXXII,"Nor after, was she ever seen to smile."
41539,XXXII,
41540,XXXIII,XXXIII
41541,XXXIII,"The heartfelt fear, the torment evermore"
41542,XXXIII,Of losing Brandimart the dame pursued.
41543,XXXIII,She him whilere a hundred times and more
41544,XXXIII,Engaged in fierce and fearful fight had viewed;
41545,XXXIII,Nor ever suchlike terror heretofore
41546,XXXIII,Had blanched her cheek and froze her youthful blood;
41547,XXXIII,"And this new sense of fear increased her trouble,"
41548,XXXIII,And made the trembling lady's heart beat double.
41549,XXXIII,
41550,XXXIV,XXXIV
41551,XXXIV,"The warriors to the wind their canvas rear,"
41552,XXXIV,When point device the three accoutred are.
41553,XXXIV,"Bold Sansonet is left, with England's peer,"
41554,XXXIV,Intrusted with the faithful army's care.
41555,XXXIV,"Flordelice, pricked at heart with cruel fear,"
41556,XXXIV,"Filling the heavens with vow, lament and prayer,"
41557,XXXIV,"As far as they by sight can followed be,"
41558,XXXIV,Follows their sails upon the foaming sea.
41559,XXXIV,
41560,XXXV,XXXV
41561,XXXV,"Scarce, with much labour, the two captains led"
41562,XXXV,"Her, gazing on the waters, from the shore,"
41563,XXXV,"And to the palace drew, where on her bed"
41564,XXXV,"They left the lady, grieved and trembling sore."
41565,XXXV,"Meanwhile upon their quest those others sped,"
41566,XXXV,Whom mercy wind and weather seaward bore.
41567,XXXV,Their vessel made that island on the right;
41568,XXXV,The field appointed for so fell a fight.
41569,XXXV,
41570,XXXVI,XXXVI
41571,XXXVI,"Orlando disembarks, with his array,"
41572,XXXVI,His kinsman Olivier and Brandimart;
41573,XXXVI,"Who on the side which fronts the eastern ray,"
41574,XXXVI,"Encamp them, and not haply without art."
41575,XXXVI,"King Agramant arrives that very day,"
41576,XXXVI,And tents him on the contrary part.
41577,XXXVI,"But for the sun is sinking fast, forborne"
41578,XXXVI,Is their encounter till the following morn.
41579,XXXVI,
41580,XXXVII,XXXVII
41581,XXXVII,"Until the skies the dawning light receive,"
41582,XXXVII,Armed servants keep their watch both there and here.
41583,XXXVII,The valiant Brandimart resorts that eve
41584,XXXVII,"Thitherward, where their tents the paynims rear;"
41585,XXXVII,"And parleys, by this noble leader's leave,"
41586,XXXVII,With Agramant; for they were friends whilere;
41587,XXXVII,"And, underneath the banner of the Moor,"
41588,XXXVII,He into France had passed from Africk's shore.
41589,XXXVII,
41590,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
41591,XXXVIII,"After salutes, and joining hand with hand,"
41592,XXXVIII,"Fair reasons, as a friend, the faithful knight"
41593,XXXVIII,Pressed on the leader of the paynim band
41594,XXXVIII,Why he should not the appointed battle fight;
41595,XXXVIII,And every town -- restored to his command --
41596,XXXVIII,"Laying  'twixt Nile and Calpe's rocky height,"
41597,XXXVIII,"Vowed he, with Roland's license, should receive,"
41598,XXXVIII,If upon Mary's Son he would believe.
41599,XXXVIII,
41600,XXXIX,XXXIX
41601,XXXIX,"He said: ""For loved you were, and are by me,"
41602,XXXIX,"This counsel give I; that I deem it sane,"
41603,XXXIX,"Since I pursue it, you assured must be:"
41604,XXXIX,Mahound I hold but as an idol vain;
41605,XXXIX,"In Jesus Christ, the living God I see,"
41606,XXXIX,And to conduct you in my way were fain;
41607,XXXIX,I' the way of safety fain would have you move
41608,XXXIX,With me and all those others that I love.
41609,XXXIX,
41610,XL,XL
41611,XL,"""In this consists your welfare; counsel none"
41612,XL,"Save this, in your disaster, can avail;"
41613,XL,"And, of all counsels least, good Milo's son"
41614,XL,"To meet in combat, clad in plate and mail;"
41615,XL,"In that the profit, if the field be won,"
41616,XL,"Weighs not against the loss, in equal scale."
41617,XL,"If you be conqueror, little gain ensues,"
41618,XL,"Yet little loss results not, if you lose."
41619,XL,
41620,XLI,XLI
41621,XLI,"""Were good Orlando and we others slain,"
41622,XLI,Banded with him to conquer or to die;
41623,XLI,"Wherefore, through this, ye should your lost domain"
41624,XLI,"Acquire anew, forsooth, I see not, I;"
41625,XLI,Nor is there reason hope to entertain
41626,XLI,"That, if we lifeless on the champaigne lie,"
41627,XLI,Men should be wanting in King Charles's host
41628,XLI,"To guard in Africa his paltriest post."""
41629,XLI,
41630,XLII,XLII
41631,XLII,Thus Brandimart to Afick's cavalier;
41632,XLII,"And much would have subjoined; but, on his side,"
41633,XLII,"That knight, with angry voice and haughty cheer,"
41634,XLII,"The pagan interrupted, and replied:"
41635,XLII,""" `Tis sure temerity and madness sheer"
41636,XLII,"Moves you and whatsoever wight beside,"
41637,XLII,"That counsels matter, be it good or ill,"
41638,XLII,Uncalled a counsellor's duty to fulfil;
41639,XLII,
41640,XLIII,XLIII
41641,XLIII,"""And how to think, from love those counsels flow"
41642,XLIII,"Which once you bore and bear me, as you say,"
41643,XLIII,"(To speak the very truth) I do not know,"
41644,XLIII,"Who with Orlando see you here, this day."
41645,XLIII,"I ween that, knowing you are doomed to woe,"
41646,XLIII,"And marked for the devouring dragon's prey,"
41647,XLIII,"Ye all mankind would drag to nether hell,"
41648,XLIII,In your eternity of pains to dwell.
41649,XLIII,
41650,XLIV,XLIV
41651,XLIV,"""If I shall win or lose, remount my throne,"
41652,XLIV,"Or pass my future days in exile drear,"
41653,XLIV,"God only knows, whose purpose is unknown"
41654,XLIV,"To me, in turn, or to Anglantes' peer."
41655,XLIV,"Befall what may, by me shall nought be done"
41656,XLIV,"Unworthy of a king, through shameful fear."
41657,XLIV,"If death must be my certain portion, I,"

41661,XLV,"""Ye may depart, who, save ye better play"

41663,XLV,"Then ye have plaid the embassador to-day,"
41664,XLV,"In arms will second ill Anglantes' knight."""
41665,XLV,Agramant ended so his furious say;
41666,XLV,-- His angry bosom boiling with despite.
41667,XLV,"So said -- the warriors parted, to repose,"
41668,XLV,Till from the neighbouring sea the day arose.
41669,XLV,
41670,XLVI,XLVI
41671,XLVI,"When the first whitening of the dawn was seen,"
41672,XLVI,"Armed, in a moment leapt on horseback all;"
41673,XLVI,Short parley past the puissant foes between.
41674,XLVI,There was no stop; there was no interval;
41675,XLVI,For they have laid in rest their lances keen:
41676,XLVI,But I into too foul a fault should fall
41677,XLVI,"Meseems, my lord, if, while their deeds I tell"
41678,XLVI,I let Rogero perish in the swell.
41679,XLVI,
41680,XLVII,XLVII
41681,XLVII,Cleaving the flood with nimble hands and feet
41682,XLVII,"He swims, amid the horrid surges' roar,"
41683,XLVII,"On him the threatening wind and tempest beat,"
41684,XLVII,But him his harassed conscience vexes more.
41685,XLVII,"Christ's wrath he fears; and, since in waters sweet"
41686,XLVII,(When time and fair occasion served of yore)
41687,XLVII,"He, in his folly, baptism little prized,"
41688,XLVII,Fears in these bitter waves to be baptized.
41689,XLVII,
41690,XLVIII,XLVIII
41691,XLVIII,Those many promises remembered are
41692,XLVIII,"Whereby he to his lady-love was tied,"
41693,XLVIII,"Those oaths which sworn to good Rinaldo were,"
41694,XLVIII,And were in nought fulfilled upon his side.
41695,XLVIII,"To God, in hope that he would hear and spare,"
41696,XLVIII,"That he repented, oftentimes he cried,"
41697,XLVIII,"And, should he land, and scape that mortal scaith,"
41698,XLVIII,"To be a Christian, vowed in heart and faith;"
41699,XLVIII,
41700,XLIX,XLIX
41701,XLIX,"And ne'er, in succour of the Moorish train,"
41702,XLIX,"With sword or lance, the faithful to offend;"
41703,XLIX,"And into France, where he to Charlemagne"
41704,XLIX,"Would render honour due, forthwith to wend;"
41705,XLIX,Nor Bradamant with idle words again
41706,XLIX,"To cheat, but bring his love to honest end."
41707,XLIX,"A miracle it is that, as he vows,"
41708,XLIX,He swims more lightly and his vigour grows.
41709,XLIX,
41710,L,L
41711,L,His vigour grows; unwearied is his mind;
41712,L,"And still his arms from him the billow throw,"

41714,L,"Whereof one lifts him high, one sinks him low."
41715,L,"Rising and falling, vext by wave and wind,"
41716,L,So gains the Child that shore with labour slow;

41720,LI,LI
41721,LI,All the others that had plunged into the flood
41722,LI,"In the end, o'erwhelmed by those wild waters died."
41723,LI,"Rogero, as to Providence seemed good,"
41724,LI,Mounted the solitary islet's side.
41725,LI,"When safe upon the barren rock he stood,"
41726,LI,A new alarm the stripling terrified;
41727,LI,"To be within those narrow bounds confined,"

41729,LI,
41730,LII,LII
41731,LII,"Yet he with an unconquered heart, intent"

41754,LIV,"How, thither by his aid the Child should wend;"
41755,LIV,"Wherein his past and future life, reviewed,"

41765,LV,"And what he should have done, when whilom prayed"
41766,LV,And called of Christ -- then uncompelled and free --
41767,LV,Had done with little grace; nor turned to God
41768,LV,Until he saw him threatening with the rod.
41769,LV,
41770,LVI,LVI
41771,LVI,Then comforts him -- that Christ aye heaven allows
41772,LVI,"To them, that late or early heaven desire;"
41773,LVI,"And all those labourers of the Gospel shows,"
41774,LVI,Paid by the vineyard's lord with equal hire.
41775,LVI,"With charity and warm devotion glows,"
41776,LVI,"And him instructs the venerable sire,"

41778,LVI,He with weak steps and slow Rogero guides.
41779,LVI,
41780,LVII,LVII
41781,LVII,"Above that hallowed cell, on the hill's brow,"
41782,LVII,A little church receives the rising day;
41783,LVII,Commodious is the fane and fair enow;
41784,LVII,"Thence to the beach descends a thicket gray,"
41785,LVII,"Where fertile and fruit-bearing palm-trees blow,"
41786,LVII,"Myrtle, and lowly juniper, and bay,"

41791,LVIII,"'Twas well nigh forty years, since on that stone"

41795,LVIII,"Pure water was his drink, and, plucked from one,"
41796,LVIII,"Or the other plant, wild berries were his meat;"

41827,LXI,"As well as Bertolagi's, should be slain"
41828,LXI,By false Maganza's ill and impious train;
41829,LXI,
41830,LXII,LXII
41831,LXII,"And, how that treason should be smothered so,"
41832,LXII,No sign thereof should outwardly appear;
41833,LXII,"For where that evil people dealt the blow,"
41834,LXII,They should entomb the youthful cavalier.
41835,LXII,"For this should vengeance follow, albeit slow,"
41836,LXII,Dealt by his consort and his sister dear;
41837,LXII,"And how he by his wife should long be sought,"

41844,LXIII,"And mead, and field, with furrows glad indented,"
41845,LXIII,That he for these left pools which Xanthus fills;
41846,LXIII,"And Ida, and Ascanius long lamented,)"
41847,LXIII,"Till she a child should in the forests bear,"
41848,LXIII,Which little distant from Ateste are;
41849,LXIII,
41850,LXIV,LXIV
41851,LXIV,"And how the Child, in might and beauty grown,"
41852,LXIV,"That, like his sire, Rogero shall be hight,"
41853,LXIV,"Those Trojans, as of Trojan lineage known,"
41854,LXIV,Shall for their lord elect with solemn rite;
41855,LXIV,Who next by Charles (in succour of whose crown
41856,LXIV,Against the Lombards shall the stripling fight)
41857,LXIV,"Of that fair land dominion shall obtain,"
41858,LXIV,And the honoured title of a marquis gain;
41859,LXIV,
41860,LXV,LXV
41861,LXV,"And because Charles shall say in Latin `Este',"
41862,LXV,(That is -- be lords of the dominion round!)
41863,LXV,Entitled in a future season Este
41864,LXV,Shall with good omen be that beauteous ground;
41865,LXV,And thus its ancient title of Ateste
41866,LXV,Shall of its two first letters lose the sound.
41867,LXV,God also to his servant had foresaid
41868,LXV,The vengeance taken for Rogero's dead;
41869,LXV,
41870,LXVI,LXVI
41871,LXVI,"Who shall, in vision, to his consort true"
41872,LXVI,Appear somedeal before the dawn of day;
41873,LXVI,"And shall relate how him the traitor slew,"
41874,LXVI,And where his body lies to her shall say.
41875,LXVI,"She and Marphisa hence, those valiant two,"
41876,LXVI,With fire and sword on earth shall Poictiers lay;
41877,LXVI,"Nor shall his son, when of befitting age,"
41878,LXVI,Less harm Maganza in his mighty rage.
41879,LXVI,
41880,LXVII,LXVII
41881,LXVII,"On Azos, Alberts, Obysons, did dwell"
41882,LXVII,"That hermit hoar, and on their offspring bright;"
41883,LXVII,"Or Borso, Nicholas, and Leonel,"
41884,LXVII,"Alphonso, Hercules, and Hippolyte,"
41885,LXVII,"And. last of those, the gentle Isabel;"
41886,LXVII,Then curbs his tongue and will no more recite.
41887,LXVII,"He to Rogero what is fit reveals,"
41888,LXVII,"And what is fitting to conceal, conceals."
41889,LXVII,
41890,LXVIII,LXVIII
41891,LXVIII,"Meanwhile Orlando and bold Brandimart,"
41892,LXVIII,"With that good knight, the Marquis Olivier,"
41893,LXVIII,Against the paynim Mars together start;
41894,LXVIII,(Name well befitting Sericana's peer)
41895,LXVIII,"And the other two -- that from the adverse part,"
41896,LXVIII,At more than a foot-pace their coursers steer;
41897,LXVIII,I say King Agramant and King Sobrine:
41898,LXVIII,"The pebbly beach resounds, and rolling brine."
41899,LXVIII,
41900,LXIX,LXIX
41901,LXIX,"When they encounter in mid field, pell-mell,"
41902,LXIX,"And to the sky flew every shivered lance,"
41903,LXIX,"At that loud noise, the sea was seen to swell,"
41904,LXIX,"At that loud noise, which echoed even to France."
41905,LXIX,Gradasso and Roland met as it befel;
41906,LXIX,"And fairly balanced might appear the chance,"
41907,LXIX,But for the vantage of Rinaldo's horse;
41908,LXIX,Which made Gradasso seem of greater force.
41909,LXIX,
41910,LXX,LXX
41911,LXX,"Baiardo shocked the steed of lesser might,"
41912,LXX,"Backed by Orlando, with such might and main,"
41913,LXX,"He made that courser stagger, left and right,"
41914,LXX,And measure next his length upon the plain:
41915,LXX,"Vainly to raise him strove Anglantes' knight,"
41916,LXX,"Thrice, nay four times, with rowels and with rein;"
41917,LXX,"Balked of his end, he lights upon the field,"
41918,LXX,"Draws Balisarda, and uplifts his shield."
41919,LXX,
41920,LXXI,LXXI
41921,LXXI,"With Agramant encounters Olivier,"
41922,LXXI,"Who, fitly matched, their foaming coursers gall."
41923,LXXI,Bold Brandimart unhorsed in the career
41924,LXXI,Sobrino; but it was not plain withal
41925,LXXI,If 'twas the fault of horse or cavalier;
41926,LXXI,For seldom good Sobrino used to fall.
41927,LXXI,"Was it his courser's or his own misdeed,"
41928,LXXI,Sobrino found himself without a steed.
41929,LXXI,
41930,LXXII,LXXII
41931,LXXII,"Now Brandimart, that upon earth descried"
41932,LXXII,"The king Sobrine, assailed no more his man;"
41933,LXXII,"But at Gradasso, who Anglantes' pride"
41934,LXXII,"Had equally unhorsed, in fury ran."
41935,LXXII,"On Agramant and Oliviero's side,"
41936,LXXII,Meanwhile the warfare stood as it began:
41937,LXXII,"When broken on their bucklers were the spears,"
41938,LXXII,With swords encountered the returning peers.
41939,LXXII,
41940,LXXIII,LXXIII
41941,LXXIII,"Roland who saw Gradasso in such guise,"
41942,LXXIII,"As showed that to return he little cared,"
41943,LXXIII,"-- Nor can return; so Brandimart aye plies,"
41944,LXXIII,"And presses Sericana's monarch hard,"
41945,LXXIII,"Turns round, and, like himself, afoot descries"
41946,LXXIII,"Sobrino, in the doubtful strife unpaired:"
41947,LXXIII,"At him he sprang; and, at his haughty look,"
41948,LXXIII,"Heaven, as the warrior trod, in terror shook."
41949,LXXIII,
41950,LXXIV,LXXIV
41951,LXXIV,"Foreseeing the assault with wary eye,"
41952,LXXIV,"Prepared, and at close ward, behold the Moor!"
41953,LXXIV,"As pilot against whom, now cresting nigh,"
41954,LXXIV,"The threatening billow comes with hollow roar,"
41955,LXXIV,"Towards it turns his prow, and, when so high"
41956,LXXIV,"He views the sea, would gladly be ashore."
41957,LXXIV,"Sobrino rears his buckler, to withstand"
41958,LXXIV,The furious fall of Falerina's brand.
41959,LXXIV,
41960,LXXV,LXXV
41961,LXXV,"Of such fine steel was Balisarda's blade,"
41962,LXXV,That arms against it little shelter were;
41963,LXXV,"And by a person of such puissance swayed,"
41964,LXXV,"By Roland, singe in the world or rare,"
41965,LXXV,"It splits the shield, and is in nowise stayed,"
41966,LXXV,Though bound about with steel the edges are:
41967,LXXV,"It splits the shield, and to the bottom rends,"
41968,LXXV,And on the shoulder underneath descends.
41969,LXXV,
41970,LXXVI,LXXVI
41971,LXXVI,"Upon the shoulder; nor, though twisted chain"
41972,LXXVI,"And double plates encase the paynim foe,"
41973,LXXVI,These hinder much that sword of stubborn grain
41974,LXXVI,From opening wide the parted flesh below.
41975,LXXVI,Sobrino at Orlando smites; but vain
41976,LXXVI,Against the valiant count is every blow;
41977,LXXVI,"To whom, for special grace, the King of heaven"
41978,LXXVI,A body charmed against all arms had given.
41979,LXXVI,
41980,LXXVII,LXXVII
41981,LXXVII,"The valorous count, redoubling still his blows,"
41982,LXXVII,Thought from the trunk the monarch's head to smite.
41983,LXXVII,"Sobrino, who the strength of Clermont knows,"
41984,LXXVII,"And how the shield ill boots, retired from fight,"
41985,LXXVII,"Yet not so far, but that upon his brows"
41986,LXXVII,Fell the dread faulchion of Anglantes' knight:
41987,LXXVII,"'Twas on its flat, but such his might and main,"
41988,LXXVII,It crushed the helm and stupefied the brain.
41989,LXXVII,
41990,LXXVIII,LXXVIII
41991,LXXVIII,"Stunned by that furious stroke, he pressed the shore,"
41992,LXXVIII,And it was long ere he again did rise.
41993,LXXVIII,"The paladin believes the warfare o'er,"
41994,LXXVIII,And that deprived of life Sobrino lies;
41995,LXXVIII,"And, lest Gradasso to ill pass and sore"
41996,LXXVIII,"Should bring Sir Brandimart, at him he flies:"
41997,LXXVIII,"For him the paynim overmatched in horse,"
41998,LXXVIII,"In arms and faulchion, and perhaps in force."
41999,LXXVIII,
42000,LXXIX,LXXIX
42001,LXXIX,"Bold Brandimart, who guides Frontino's rein,"
42002,LXXIX,"The goodly courser, erst Rogero's steed,"
42003,LXXIX,"So well contends with him of Sericane,"
42004,LXXIX,The king yet little seems his foe to exceed;
42005,LXXIX,"Who, if he had as tempered plate and chain"
42006,LXXIX,"As that bold paynim lord, would better speed;"
42007,LXXIX,But (for he felt himself ill-armed) the knight
42008,LXXIX,"Often gave ground, and traversed left and right."
42009,LXXIX,
42010,LXXX,LXXX
42011,LXXX,Better than good Frontino horse is none
42012,LXXX,To obey upon a sign the cavalier;
42013,LXXX,'Twould seem that courser had the sense to shun
42014,LXXX,"Sharp Durindana's fall, now there now here."
42015,LXXX,Meanwhile elsewhere is horrid battle done
42016,LXXX,By royal Agramant and Olivier;
42017,LXXX,"Who may be deemed well matched in warlike sleight,"
42018,LXXX,Nor champions differing much in martial might.
42019,LXXX,
42020,LXXXI,LXXXI
42021,LXXXI,Orlando had left Sobrino (as I said)
42022,LXXXI,"On earth, and against Sericana's pride,"
42023,LXXXI,"Desirous valiant Brandimart to aid,"
42024,LXXXI,"Even as he was, afoot, in fury hied:"
42025,LXXXI,"When, prompt to assail Gradasso with the blade,"
42026,LXXXI,"He, loose and walking in mid field, espied"
42027,LXXXI,"The goodly horse, which had Sobrino thrown;"
42028,LXXXI,And bowned him straight to make the steed his own.
42029,LXXXI,
42030,LXXXII,LXXXII
42031,LXXXII,He seized the horse (for none the deed gainsaid)
42032,LXXXII,"And took a leap, and vaulted on his prize."
42033,LXXXII,"This hand the bridle grasped, and that the blade."
42034,LXXXII,Orlando's motions good Gradasso spies;
42035,LXXXII,Nor at his coming is the king dismaid;
42036,LXXXII,Who by his name the paladin defies:
42037,LXXXII,"With him, and both his partners in the fight,"
42038,LXXXII,He hopes to make it dark before 'tis night.
42039,LXXXII,
42040,LXXXIII,LXXXIII
42041,LXXXIII,"Leaving his foe, he, facing Brava's lord,"
42042,LXXXIII,"Thrust at the collar of his shirt of mail,"
42043,LXXXIII,All else beside the flesh the faulchion bored;
42044,LXXXIII,To pierce through which would every labour fail.
42045,LXXXIII,"At the same time descends Orlando's sword,"
42046,LXXXIII,(Where Balisarda bites no spells avail)
42047,LXXXIII,"Shears helmet, cuirass, shield, and all below,"
42048,LXXXIII,And cleaves whate'er it rakes with headlong blow;
42049,LXXXIII,
42050,LXXXIV,LXXXIV
42051,LXXXIV,"And in face, bosom, and in thigh it seamed,"
42052,LXXXIV,"Beneath his mail, the king of Sericane."
42053,LXXXIV,From whom his blood till how had never streamed
42054,LXXXIV,Since he that armour wore; new rage and pain
42055,LXXXIV,"Thereat the warrior felt, and strange it seemed"
42056,LXXXIV,"Sword cut so now, nor yet was Durindane."
42057,LXXXIV,"Had Roland struck more home, or nearer been,"
42058,LXXXIV,From head to belly he had cleft him clean.
42059,LXXXIV,
42060,LXXXV,LXXXV
42061,LXXXV,No more in arms can trust the cavalier
42062,LXXXV,As heretofore; for proved those arms have been:
42063,LXXXV,"He with more care, more caution than whilere,"
42064,LXXXV,Prepares to parry with the faulchion keen.
42065,LXXXV,"When entered Brandimart sees Brava's peer,"
42066,LXXXV,"Who snatched that battle from him, he between"
42067,LXXXV,"Those other conflicts placed himself, that where"
42068,LXXXV,"It most was needed, he might succour bear."
42069,LXXXV,
42070,LXXXVI,LXXXVI
42071,LXXXVI,"While so the fight is balanced 'mid those foes,"
42072,LXXXVI,"Sobrino, that on earth long time had lain,"
42073,LXXXVI,"When to himself he was returned, uprose,"
42074,LXXXVI,In face and shoulder suffering grievous pain.
42075,LXXXVI,"He lifts his face, his eyes about him throws;"
42076,LXXXVI,"And thither, where more distant on the plain"
42077,LXXXVI,"He sees his leader, with long paces steers"
42078,LXXXVI,"So stealthily, that none his coming hears;"
42079,LXXXVI,
42080,LXXXVII,LXXXVII
42081,LXXXVII,"He on the Marquis came, who had but eyes"
42082,LXXXVII,"For Agramant, and in the warrior's rear,"
42083,LXXXVII,Wounded upon the hocks in such fierce wise
42084,LXXXVII,"The courser of unheeding Olivier,"
42085,LXXXVII,That he falls headlong; and beneath him lies
42086,LXXXVII,"His valiant master, nor his foot can clear;"
42087,LXXXVII,"His left foot, which in that unthought for woe,"
42088,LXXXVII,"Was in the stirrup jammed, his steed below."
42089,LXXXVII,
42090,LXXXVIII,LXXXVIII
42091,LXXXVIII,"Sorbine pursued, and with back-handed blow"
42092,LXXXVIII,Thought he his head should from his neck have shorn;
42093,LXXXVIII,"But this forbids that armour, bright of show,"
42094,LXXXVIII,"By Vulcan hammered, and by Hector worn."
42095,LXXXVIII,"Brandimart sees his risque, and at the foe"
42096,LXXXVIII,"Is by his steed, with flowing bridle, borne."
42097,LXXXVIII,Sobrino on the head he smote and flung;
42098,LXXXVIII,But straight from earth that fierce old man upsprung;
42099,LXXXVIII,
42100,LXXXIX,LXXXIX
42101,LXXXIX,"And turned anew to Olivier, to speed"
42102,LXXXIX,The warrior's soul more promptly on its way;
42103,LXXXIX,Or at the least that baron to impede.
42104,LXXXIX,And him beneath his courser keep at bay:
42105,LXXXIX,"Bold Olivier, whose better arm was freed,"
42106,LXXXIX,"And with his sword could fend him as he lay,"
42107,LXXXIX,"Meanwhile so smites and longes, there and here,"
42108,LXXXIX,That at sword's length he holds the ancient peer.
42109,LXXXIX,
42110,XC,XC
42111,XC,"He hopes, if him but little he withstood,"
42112,XC,He shall be straight delivered from that pain:
42113,XC,"He sees him wholly strained and wet with blood,"
42114,XC,"And that he spills so much from open vein,"
42115,XC,"'Twould seem he speedily must be subdued,"
42116,XC,So weak he hardly can himself sustain.
42117,XC,"Often and oft to rise the Marquis strove,"
42118,XC,Yet could not from beneath his courser move.
42119,XC,
42120,XCI,XCI
42121,XCI,"Brandimart has found out the royal Moor,"
42122,XCI,And storms about that paynim cavalier;
42123,XCI,"Upon Frontino, like a lathe, before,"
42124,XCI,"Beside, or whirling in the warrior's rear."
42125,XCI,A goodly horse the Christian champion bore;
42126,XCI,Nor worse the southern king's in the career:
42127,XCI,"That Brigliador, Rogero's gift he crost,"
42128,XCI,"Erewhile, by haughty Mandricardo lost."
42129,XCI,
42130,XCII,XCII
42131,XCII,"Great vantage has he, on another part:"
42132,XCII,Of proof and perfect is his iron weed.
42133,XCII,"His at a venture took Sir Brandimart,"
42134,XCII,As he could have in haste in suchlike need;
42135,XCII,But hopes (his anger puts him so in heart)
42136,XCII,To change it for a better coat with speech;
42137,XCII,"Albeit the Moorish king, with bitter blow,"
42138,XCII,Has made the blood from his right should flow.
42139,XCII,
42140,XCIII,XCIII
42141,XCIII,Him in the flank Gradasso too had gored;
42142,XCIII,(Nor this was laughing matter) so had scanned
42143,XCIII,"His vantage that redoubted paynim lord,"
42144,XCIII,He found a place wherein to plant his brand;
42145,XCIII,"He broke the warrior's shield, his left arm bored,"
42146,XCIII,And touched him slightly in the better hand.
42147,XCIII,"But this was play, was pastime (might be said),"
42148,XCIII,With Roland's and Gradasso's battle weighed.
42149,XCIII,
42150,XCIV,XCIV
42151,XCIV,Gradasso has Orlando half disarmed;
42152,XCIV,Atop and on both sides his helm has broke:
42153,XCIV,"Fallen is his shield, his cuirass split; but harmed"
42154,XCIV,"The warrior is not by the furious stroke,"
42155,XCIV,Which opened plate and mail; for he is charmed;
42156,XCIV,"And worser vengeance on the king has wroke,"
42157,XCIV,"In face, throat, breast has gored that cavalier,"
42158,XCIV,Beside the wounds whereof I spake whilere.
42159,XCIV,
42160,XCV,XCV
42161,XCV,"Gradasso, desperate when he descried"
42162,XCV,"Himself all wet, and smeared with sanguine dye,"
42163,XCV,"And Roland, all from head to foot espied,"
42164,XCV,"After such mighty strokes unstained and dry,"
42165,XCV,"Thinking head, breast, and belly to divide,"
42166,XCV,With both his hands upheaved his sword on high;
42167,XCV,"And, even as he devised, upon the front,"
42168,XCV,Smote with mid blade Anglantes' haughty count.
42169,XCV,
42170,XCVI,XCVI
42171,XCVI,And would by any other so have done;
42172,XCVI,-- Would to the saddle-tree have cleft him clean:
42173,XCVI,"But the good sword, as if it fell upon"
42174,XCVI,"Its flat, rebounds again, unstained and sheen."
42175,XCVI,The furious stroke astounded Milo's son
42176,XCVI,By whom some scattered stars on earth were seen.
42177,XCVI,"He drops the bridle and would drop the brand,"
42178,XCVI,But that a chain secures it to his hand.
42179,XCVI,
42180,XCVII,XCVII
42181,XCVII,So by the noise was scared the horse that bore
42182,XCVII,Upon his back Anglantes' cavalier.
42183,XCVII,"The courser scowered about the powdery shore,"
42184,XCVII,Showing how good his speed in the career:
42185,XCVII,"The County by that stroke astounded sore,"
42186,XCVII,Has not the power the frightened horse to steer.
42187,XCVII,"Gradasso follows and will reach him, so"
42188,XCVII,That he but little more pursues the foe;
42189,XCVII,
42190,XCVIII,XCVIII
42191,XCVIII,"But turning round, beholds the royal Moor"
42192,XCVIII,To the utmost peril in that battle brought;
42193,XCVIII,"For by the shining helmet which he wore,"
42194,XCVIII,"With the left hand, him Brandimart had caught;"
42195,XCVIII,"Already had unlaced the casque before,"
42196,XCVIII,And with his dagger would new ill have wrought:
42197,XCVIII,Nor much defence could make the Moorish lord;
42198,XCVIII,For Brandimart as well had reft his sword.
42199,XCVIII,
42200,XCIX,XCIX
42201,XCIX,"Gradasso turned, nor more Orlando sought,"
42202,XCIX,But hastened where he Agramant espied:
42203,XCIX,"The incautious Brandimart, suspecting nought"
42204,XCIX,"Orlando would have let him turn aside,"
42205,XCIX,"Had not Gradasso in his eyes or thought,"
42206,XCIX,And to the paynim's throat his knife applied.
42207,XCIX,"Gradasso came, and at his helmet layed,"
42208,XCIX,Wielding with either hand his trenchant blade.
42209,XCIX,

42211,C,"Father of heaven!  'mid spirits chosen by thee,"

42325,VIII,"Scaped, bleeding, with helm loosened form his head,"

42330,VIII,With ruffled plumage and with loss of tail.

42348,X,"He shook at heart, a troubled visage shewed,"

42350,X,"Presageful of his fate, appears subdued:"
42351,X,"Nor seeks he means of fence against his foe,"

42354,XI,XI
42355,XI,"Orlando levels at his better side,"
42356,XI,"Beneath the lowest rib, his faulchion bright;"

42358,XI,"Of the other flank, the sword appears in sight;"
42359,XI,"And well his mighty puissance testified,"
42360,XI,And spoke him as the strongest living knight
42361,XI,"That stroke, by which a warrior was undone,"
42362,XI,Better than whom in Paynimry was none.
42363,XI,
42364,XII,XII
42365,XII,Little his victory good Orlando cheers:
42366,XII,Himself he quickly from his saddle throws;
42367,XII,"And, with a face disturbed, and wet with tears,"
42368,XII,To his Brandimart in haste the warrior goes;
42369,XII,"The field about him red with blood appears,"
42370,XII,His helmet cleft as by a hatchet's blows;
42371,XII,"And, had it been than spungy rind more frail,"
42372,XII,Would have defended him no worse than mail.
42373,XII,
42374,XIII,XIII
42375,XIII,"Orlando lifts the helmet, and descries"
42376,XIII,Brandimart's head by that destructive brand
42377,XIII,"Cleft even to his nose, between the eyes;"
42378,XIII,"Yet so the wounded knight his spirits manned,"
42379,XIII,That pardon of the king of Paradise
42380,XIII,"He, before death, was able to demand,"
42381,XIII,"And to exhort to patience Brava's peer,"
42382,XIII,Whose manly cheeks were wet with many a tear;
42383,XIII,
42384,XIV,XIV
42385,XIV,"And -- ""Roland, in thy helping orisons, I"
42386,XIV,"Beseech thee to remember me,"" he cried,"
42387,XIV,"""Nor recommend to thee less warmly my --"""
42388,XIV,"-- Flordelice would, but could not, say -- and died;"
42389,XIV,"And sounds and songs of angels in the sky,"
42390,XIV,"As the soul parts, are heard on every side;"
42391,XIV,"Which from its prison freed, mid hymns of love,"
42392,XIV,Ascends into the blissful realms above.
42393,XIV,
42394,XV,XV
42395,XV,"Orlando, albeit he should joy in heart"
42396,XV,"At death so holy, and is certified"
42397,XV,That called to bliss above is Brandimart;
42398,XV,For he heaven opened to the knight described;
42399,XV,Through human wilfulness -- which aye takes part
42400,XV,With our weak senses -- hardly can abide
42401,XV,"The loss of one, above a brother dear,"
42402,XV,Nor can refrain from many a scalding tear.
42403,XV,
42404,XVI,XVI
42405,XVI,"Warlike Sobrino, of much blood bereaved,"
42406,XVI,"Which from his flank and wounded visage rained,"
42407,XVI,"Long since had fallen, reversed and sore aggrieved,"
42408,XVI,And had by now his vessels well nigh drained.
42409,XVI,"Olivier too lies stretched; nor has retrieved,"
42410,XVI,"Nor can retrieve, his crippled foot, save sprained,"
42411,XVI,"And almost crushed; so long between the plain,"
42412,XVI,"And his stout courser jammed, the limb has lain;"
42413,XVI,
42414,XVII,XVII
42415,XVII,And but Orlando helped (so woe begone
42416,XVII,"Was weeping Olivier, and brought so low)"
42417,XVII,He could not have released his limb alone;
42418,XVII,"And, when released, endures such pain, such woe,"
42419,XVII,"The helpless warrior cannot stand upon,"
42420,XVII,"Or shift withal his wounded foot, and so"
42421,XVII,"Benumbed and crippled is the leg above,"
42422,XVII,That he without assistance cannot move.
42423,XVII,
42424,XVIII,XVIII
42425,XVIII,The victory brought Orlando small delight;
42426,XVIII,On whom too heavily and hardly weighed
42427,XVIII,Of slaughtered Brandimart the piteous sight;
42428,XVIII,Nor sure of Oliviero's life he made.
42429,XVIII,Sobrino yet survived; but little light
42430,XVIII,"The wounded monarch had, amid much shade:"
42431,XVIII,For almost spend his ebbing life remained
42432,XVIII,So fast from him the crimson blood had drained.
42433,XVIII,
42434,XIX,XIX
42435,XIX,"The County has him taken, bleeding sore;"
42436,XIX,"Thither, where he is saved with sovereign care;"
42437,XIX,"And he as if a kinsman of the Moor,"
42438,XIX,Benignly comforts him and speaks him fair:
42439,XIX,"For in Orlando, when the strife was o'er,"
42440,XIX,Was nothing evil; ever prompt to spare.
42441,XIX,"He from the dead their arms and coursers reft,"
42442,XIX,The rest he to their knives' disposal left.
42443,XIX,
42444,XX,XX
42445,XX,"Here as my story stood not on good ground,"
42446,XX,Frederick Fulgoso doubtful does appear;
42447,XX,"Who, searching Barbary's every shore and sound"
42448,XX,"Erewhile on board a squadron, landed here;"
42449,XX,"And the isle so rugged and so rocky found,"
42450,XX,"In all its parts so mountainous and drear,"
42451,XX,There is not (through the land) a level space
42452,XX,(He says) whereon a single boot to place.
42453,XX,
42454,XXI,XXI
42455,XXI,"Nor deems he likely, that six cavaliers,"
42456,XXI,"The wide world's flower, on Alpine rock should vye,"
42457,XXI,"In that equestrian fight, with levelled spears."
42458,XXI,To whose objection thus I make reply:
42459,XXI,"Erewhile a place, well fit for such careers,"
42460,XXI,Stretched at the bottom of the hills did lie;
42461,XXI,"But afterwards, o'erthrown by earthquake's shock,"
42462,XXI,A cliff o'erspread the plain with broken rock.
42463,XXI,
42464,XXII,XXII
42465,XXII,"So, of Fulgoso's race thou shining ray,"
42466,XXII,"Clear, lasting light, if, questioning my word,"
42467,XXII,"Thou on this point hast ever said me nay,"
42468,XXII,"And haply too, before the unconquered lord,"
42469,XXII,"Through whom thy land, reposing, casts away"
42470,XXII,"All haste, and wholly leans to kind accord,"
42471,XXII,"Prythee delay not to declare, that I"
42472,XXII,In this my story haply tell no lie.
42473,XXII,
42474,XXIII,XXIII
42475,XXIII,"Meanwhile his eyes the good Orlando reared,"
42476,XXIII,"And saw, on turning them to seaward, where"
42477,XXIII,"Under full sail a nimble bark appeared,"
42478,XXIII,As if she to that island would repair.
42479,XXIII,I will not now rehearse who thither steered;
42480,XXIII,For more than one awaiteth me elsewhere.
42481,XXIII,Wend me to France and see if they be glad
42482,XXIII,"At having chased the Saracens, or sad;"
42483,XXIII,
42484,XXIV,XXIV
42485,XXIV,"See what she does withal, the lady true,"
42486,XXIV,That sees her knight content to wend so wide;
42487,XXIV,Of the afflicted Bradamant I shew;
42488,XXIV,"After she saw the oath was nullified,"
42489,XXIV,"Made in the hearing of those armies two,"
42490,XXIV,Upon the Christian and the paynim side;
42491,XXIV,"Since he again had failed her, there was nought"
42492,XXIV,"Wherein she could confide, the damsel thought."
42493,XXIV,
42494,XXV,XXV
42495,XXV,And now her too accustomed plaint and wail
42496,XXV,"Repeating, of Rogero's cruelty"
42497,XXV,Fair Bradamant renewed the wonted tale;
42498,XXV,She cursed her hard and evil destiny;
42499,XXV,"Then loosening to tempestuous grief the sail,"
42500,XXV,"Heaven that consented to such perjury,"
42501,XXV,-- And did not yet by some plain token speak --
42502,XXV,"She, in her passion, called unjust and weak."
42503,XXV,
42504,XXVI,XXVI
42505,XXVI,"The sage Melissa she accused, and cursed"
42506,XXVI,"The oracle of the cavern, through whose lie"
42507,XXVI,"She in that sea of love herself immersed,"
42508,XXVI,Upon whose waters she embarked to die.
42509,XXVI,She to Marphisa afterwards rehearsed
42510,XXVI,"Her woes, and told her brother's perfidy;"
42511,XXVI,"She chides, pours forth her sorrows, and demands,"
42512,XXVI,"With tears and outcries, succour at her hands."
42513,XXVI,
42514,XXVII,XXVII
42515,XXVII,Marphisa shrugs her shoulders; what alone
42516,XXVII,"She can, she offers -- comfort to the fair;"
42517,XXVII,Nor thinks Rogero her has so foregone
42518,XXVII,But what to her he shortly will repair.
42519,XXVII,"And, should he not, such outrage to be done,"
42520,XXVII,The damsel plights her promise not to bear;
42521,XXVII,"Twixt her and him shall deadly war be waged,"
42522,XXVII,"Or he shall keep the word, which he engaged."
42523,XXVII,
42524,XXVIII,XXVIII
42525,XXVIII,She makes her somewhat thus her grief restrain;
42526,XXVIII,"Which having vent in some sort spend its gall,"
42527,XXVIII,Now we have seen the damsel in her pain
42528,XXVIII,"Rogero impious, proud, and perjured call,"
42529,XXVIII,"See we, if in a happier state remain"
42530,XXVIII,The brother of that gentle maid withal;
42531,XXVIII,"Whose flesh, bones, nerves, and sinews are a prey"
42532,XXVIII,To burning love; Rinaldo I would say.
42533,XXVIII,
42534,XXIX,XXIX
42535,XXIX,I say Rinaldo that (as known to you)
42536,XXIX,Angelica the beauteous loved so well:
42537,XXIX,Nor him into the amorous fillets drew
42538,XXIX,So much her beauty as the magic spell.
42539,XXIX,In peace reposed those other barons true;
42540,XXIX,For wholly broken was the infidel:
42541,XXIX,"Alone amid the victors, he, of all"
42542,XXIX,"The paladins, remained Love's captive thrall."
42543,XXIX,
42544,XXX,XXX
42545,XXX,"To seek her he a hundred couriers sent,"
42546,XXX,"And sought as well,  himself, the missing maid:"
42547,XXX,"He in the end to Malagigi went,"
42548,XXX,Who in his need had often given him aid:
42549,XXX,"To him he told his love, with eyelids bent"
42550,XXX,"On earth, and visage crimsoned o'er; and prayed"
42551,XXX,"That sage magicians to instruct him, where"
42552,XXX,He in the world might find the long-sought fair.
42553,XXX,
42554,XXXI,XXXI
42555,XXXI,"A case, so strange and wondrous, marvel sore"
42556,XXXI,In friendly Malagigi's bosom bred:
42557,XXXI,"The wizard knew, a hundred times and more,"
42558,XXXI,He might have had the damsel in his bed;
42559,XXXI,"And he himself, to move the knight or yore,"
42560,XXXI,"In her behalf, enough had done and said:"
42561,XXXI,"Had him by prayer and menace sought to bend,"
42562,XXXI,Yet ne'er was able to obtain his end;
42563,XXXI,
42564,XXXII,XXXII
42565,XXXII,"And so much more, that out of prison ward"
42566,XXXII,He then would Malagigi so have brought.
42567,XXXII,"Now will he seek her, of his own accord,"
42568,XXXII,"On less occasion, when it profits nought."
42569,XXXII,Next that magician Montalbano's lord
42570,XXXII,"To mark how sorely do had erred, besought:"
42571,XXXII,"Since little lacked, but through the boon denied,"
42572,XXXII,Erewhile he had in gloomy dungeon died.
42573,XXXII,
42574,XXXIII,XXXIII
42575,XXXIII,But how much more Rinaldo's strange demand
42576,XXXIII,"Sounded importunately in his ear,"
42577,XXXIII,"So by sure index Malagigi scanned,"
42578,XXXIII,That so much was Angelica more dear.
42579,XXXIII,"Rinaldo prayer unable to withstand,"
42580,XXXIII,In ocean sunk the wizard cavalier
42581,XXXIII,"All memory of old injury assaid,"
42582,XXXIII,And bowned himself to give the warrior aid.
42583,XXXIII,
42584,XXXIV,XXXIV
42585,XXXIV,"For his reply he craved some small delay,"
42586,XXXIV,"And with fair hope consoled Mount Alban's knight,"
42587,XXXIV,He should be able of the road to say
42588,XXXIV,"By which Angelica had sped her flight,"
42589,XXXIV,In France or wheresoe'er; then wends his way
42590,XXXIV,Thither where he is wont his imps to cite;
42591,XXXIV,A grot impervious and with mountains walled:
42592,XXXIV,His book he opened and the spirits called.
42593,XXXIV,
42594,XXXV,XXXV
42595,XXXV,"Then one he chooses, in love-cases read,"
42596,XXXV,"Whom Malagigi to declare requires,"
42597,XXXV,"How good Rinaldo's heart, before so died,"
42598,XXXV,Was now so quickly moved by soft desires;
42599,XXXV,And of those fountains twain (the demon said)
42600,XXXV,"Whereof one lights, one quenches amorous fires;"
42601,XXXV,And how nought cures the mischief caused by one
42602,XXXV,But that whose streams in counter current run;
42603,XXXV,
42604,XXXVI,XXXVI
42605,XXXVI,"And says, Rinaldo, having drunk whilere"
42606,XXXVI,"From the love-chasing fountain's mossy urn,"
42607,XXXVI,"To Angelica, that long had wooed the peer,"
42608,XXXVI,Had shown himself so obstinate and stern;
42609,XXXVI,"And he, whom after his ill star did steer"
42610,XXXVI,"To drink of that which makes the bosom burn,"
42611,XXXVI,Her whom but just before he loathed above
42612,XXXVI,"All reason, by that draught was forced to love."
42613,XXXVI,
42614,XXXVII,XXXVII
42615,XXXVII,Him his ill star and cruel fate conveyed
42616,XXXVII,To swallow fire and flame i' the frozen lake:
42617,XXXVII,For nigh at the same time the Indian maid
42618,XXXVII,In the other bitter stream her thirst did slake;
42619,XXXVII,"Which in her bosom so all love allayed,"
42620,XXXVII,Henceforth she loathed him more than noisome snake;
42621,XXXVII,"He loved her, and such love was his, as late"
42622,XXXVII,Rinaldo bore her enmity and hate.
42623,XXXVII,
42624,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
42625,XXXVIII,Of this strange story fully certified
42626,XXXVIII,Was Malagigi by the demon's lore;
42627,XXXVIII,Who news as well of Angelique supplied;
42628,XXXVIII,"How yielding up herself to a young Moor,"
42629,XXXVIII,"With him embarking on the unstable tide,"
42630,XXXVIII,She had abandoned Europe's every shore;
42631,XXXVIII,"And hoisting her bold canvas to the wind,"
42632,XXXVIII,In Catalonian galley loosed for Ind.

42634,XXXIX,XXXIX
42635,XXXIX,Rinaldo seeking out the sage anew
42636,XXXIX,For his reply -- he would dissuade the knight
42637,XXXIX,"From loving more that Indian lady, who"
42638,XXXIX,Now waited on a vile barbarian wight;
42639,XXXIX,And was so distant he could ill pursue;
42640,XXXIX,"If he would chase the damsel on her flight,"
42641,XXXIX,Who must have measured than half her way
42642,XXXIX,"Homeward, with young Medoro to Catay."
42643,XXXIX,
42644,XL,XL
42645,XL,In that bold lover no displeasure deep
42646,XL,The journey of Angelica would move;
42647,XL,Nor yet would mar or break the warrior's sleep
42648,XL,To think that he again must eastward rove:
42649,XL,But that a stripling Saracen should reap
42650,XL,The first fruits of that faithless lady's love
42651,XL,"In him such passion bred, such heart-ache sore,"
42652,XL,He never in his life so grieved before.
42653,XL,
42654,XLI,XLI
42655,XLI,No power hath he to make one sole reply;
42656,XLI,"His heart, his lip, is quivering with disdain;"
42657,XLI,His tongue no word is able to untie;
42658,XLI,"His mouth is bitter, and 'twould seem with bane."
42659,XLI,"He flung from the magician suddenly,"
42660,XLI,"And, as by fury stirred and jealous pain,"
42661,XLI,He after mighty plaint and mighty woe
42662,XLI,Resolved anew to eastern realms to go.
42663,XLI,
42664,XLII,XLII
42665,XLII,"Licence he asks of Pepin's royal son,"
42666,XLII,"Upon the ground, since with his courser dear"
42667,XLII,"To Sericane is King Gradasso gone,"
42668,XLII,"Against the use of gallant cavalier,"
42669,XLII,"Him honour moves the selfsame course to run,"
42670,XLII,In the end he may prevent the paynim peer
42671,XLII,"From ever vaunting, that with sword or lance"
42672,XLII,He took him from a Paladin of France.
42673,XLII,
42674,XLIII,XLIII
42675,XLIII,"Charles gives him leave to go; though, far and nigh,"
42676,XLIII,With him all France laments he thence should wend;
42677,XLIII,"But he in fine that prayer can ill deny,"
42678,XLIII,So honest seems the worthy warrior's end.
42679,XLIII,"Him Dudon, Guido, would accompany;"
42680,XLIII,But he refuses either valiant friend:
42681,XLIII,"From Paris he departs, and wends alone,"
42682,XLIII,Plunged in his grief and heaving many a groan.
42683,XLIII,
42684,XLIV,XLIV
42685,XLIV,"Ever in memory dwells the restless thought,"
42686,XLIV,He might a thousand times have had the fair;
42687,XLIV,"And -- mad and obstinate -- had, when besought,"
42688,XLIV,A thousand times refused such beauty rare;
42689,XLIV,"And such sweet joy was whilom set at nought,"
42690,XLIV,"Such bright, such blessed moments wasted were;"
42691,XLIV,And now he life would gladly give away
42692,XLIV,To have that damsel but for one short day.
42693,XLIV,
42694,XLV,XLV
42695,XLV,"The thought will never from his mind depart,"
42696,XLV,"How for a sorry footpage she could slight,"
42697,XLV,-- Flinging their merit and their love apart --
42698,XLV,The service of each former loving wight.
42699,XLV,"Vext by such thought, which racked and rent his heart,"
42700,XLV,Rinaldo wends towards the rising light:
42701,XLV,"He the straight road to Rhine and Basle pursued,"
42702,XLV,Till he arrived in Arden's mighty wood.
42703,XLV,
42704,XLVI,XLVI
42705,XLVI,When within that adventurous wood has hied
42706,XLVI,"For many a mile Montalban's cavalier,"
42707,XLVI,"Of lonely farm or lordly castle wide,"
42708,XLVI,"Where the rude place was roughest and most drear,"
42709,XLVI,"The sky disturbed he suddenly descried,"
42710,XLVI,"He saw the sun's dimmed visage disappear,"
42711,XLVI,And spied forth issuing from a cavern hoar
42712,XLVI,"A monster, which a woman's likeness wore."
42713,XLVI,
42714,XLVII,XLVII
42715,XLVII,A thousand lidless eyes are in her head:
42716,XLVII,"She cannot close them, nor, I think, doth sleep:"
42717,XLVII,"She listens with as many ears, and spread"
42718,XLVII,"Like hair, about her forehead serpents creep."
42719,XLVII,Forth issued into day that figure dread
42720,XLVII,From devilish darkness and the caverned deep.
42721,XLVII,"For tail, a fierce and bigger serpent wound"
42722,XLVII,"About her breast, and girt the monster round."
42723,XLVII,
42724,XLVIII,XLVIII
42725,XLVIII,"What in a thousand, thousand quests had ne'er"
42726,XLVIII,"Befal'n Rinaldo, here befel the knight;"
42727,XLVIII,"Who, when he sees the horrid form appear,"
42728,XLVIII,"Coming to seek him and prepared for fight,"
42729,XLVIII,"Feels in his inmost veins such freezing fear,"
42730,XLVIII,As haply never fell on other wight;
42731,XLVIII,"Yet wonted daring counterfeits and feigns,"
42732,XLVIII,And with a trembling hand the faulchion strains.
42733,XLVIII,
42734,XLIX,XLIX
42735,XLIX,The monster so the fierce assault did make
42736,XLIX,"Therein her master was well descried,"
42737,XLIX,"It might be said; she shook a poisonous snake,"
42738,XLIX,"And now on this, now on the other side,"
42739,XLIX,Leapt at the knight; at her Rinaldo strake
42740,XLIX,Ever meanwhile with random blows and wide;
42741,XLIX,"With forestroke, backstroke, he assails the foe;"
42742,XLIX,"He often smites, but never plants a blow."
42743,XLIX,
42744,L,L
42745,L,"The monster threw a serpent at his breast,"
42746,L,That froze his heart beneath its iron case:
42747,L,"Now through the vizor flung the poisonous pest,"
42748,L,Which crept about his collar and his face.
42749,L,"Dismaid, Rinaldo fled the field, and prest"
42750,L,With all his spurs his courser through the chase:
42751,L,"But not behind the hellish monster halts,"
42752,L,Who in a thought upon the crupper vaults.
42753,L,
42754,LI,LI
42755,LI,"Wend where the warrior will, an-end or wide,"
42756,LI,Ever with him is that accursed Pest:
42757,LI,"Nor knows he how from her to be untied,"
42758,LI,Albeit his courser plunges without rest.
42759,LI,"Like a leaf quakes his heart within his side,"
42760,LI,"Not that the snakes in other mode molest,"
42761,LI,"But they such horror and such loathing bred,"
42762,LI,"He shrieks, he groans, and gladly would be dead."
42763,LI,
42764,LII,LII
42765,LII,By gloomiest track and blindest path he still
42766,LII,Threaded the tangled forest here and there;
42767,LII,"By thorniest valley and by roughest hill,"
42768,LII,And wheresoever darkest was the air;
42769,LII,"Thus hoping to have rid him of that ill,"
42770,LII,"Hideous, abominable, poisonous Care;"
42771,LII,"Beneath whose gripe he foully might have fared,"
42772,LII,But that one quickly to his aid repaired.
42773,LII,
42774,LIII,LIII
42775,LIII,"But aid, and in good time, a horseman bore,"
42776,LIII,Equipt with arms of beauteous steel and clear:
42777,LIII,"For crest, a broken yoke the stranger wore;"
42778,LIII,Red flames upon his yellow shield appear:
42779,LIII,"So was the courser's housing broidered o'er,"
42780,LIII,As the proud surcoat of the cavalier.
42781,LIII,"His lance he grasped, his sword was in its place,"
42782,LIII,And at his saddle hung a burning mace.
42783,LIII,
42784,LIV,LIV
42785,LIV,"That warrior's mace a fire eternal fills,"
42786,LIV,Whose lasting fuel ever blazes bright;
42787,LIV,"And goodly buckler, tempered corslet thrills,"
42788,LIV,And solid helm; then needs the approaching knight
42789,LIV,"Must make him way, wherever 'tis his will"
42790,LIV,To turn his inextinguishable light.
42791,LIV,"Nor of less help in need Rinaldo stands,"
42792,LIV,To save him from the cruel monster's hands.
42793,LIV,
42794,LV,LV
42795,LV,"The stranger horseman, like a warrior bold,"
42796,LV,"Where he that hubbub hears, doth thither swoop,"
42797,LV,"Until he sees the beast, whose snakes enfold"
42798,LV,"Rinaldo, linked in many a loathsome loop,"
42799,LV,"Who sweats at once with heat and quakes with cold,"
42800,LV,Nor can he thrust the monster from his croup.
42801,LV,"Arrived the stranger smote her in the flank,"
42802,LV,Who on the near side of the courser sank:
42803,LV,
42804,LVI,LVI
42805,LVI,"But scarcely was on earth extended, ere"
42806,LVI,She rose and shook her snakes in volumed spire.
42807,LVI,The knight no more assails her with the spear;
42808,LVI,But is resolved to plague the foe with fire:
42809,LVI,He gripes the mace and thunders in her rear
42810,LVI,"With frequent blows, like tempest in its ire;"
42811,LVI,Nor leaves a moment to that monster fell
42812,LVI,"To strike one stroke in answer, ill or well;"
42813,LVI,
42814,LVII,LVII
42815,LVII,"And, while he chases her or holds at bay,"
42816,LVII,"Smites her and venges many a foul affront,"
42817,LVII,"Counsels the paladin, without delay,"
42818,LVII,To take the road which scales the neighbouring mount:
42819,LVII,"He took that proffered counsel and that way,"
42820,LVII,"And without stop, or turning back his front,"
42821,LVII,Pricked furiously till he was out of sight;
42822,LVII,Though hard to clamber was the rugged height.
42823,LVII,
42824,LVIII,LVIII
42825,LVIII,"The stranger, when he to her dark retreat"
42826,LVIII,Had driven from upper light that beast of hell
42827,LVIII,"(Where she herself doth ever gnaw and eat,"
42828,LVIII,While from her thousand eyes tears ceaseless well)
42829,LVIII,"Followed the knight, to guide his wandering feet;"
42830,LVIII,And overtook him on the highest swell;
42831,LVIII,Then placed himself beside the cavalier
42832,LVIII,Him from those dark and gloomy parts to steer.
42833,LVIII,
42834,LIX,LIX
42835,LIX,"When him returned beheld Montalban's knight,"
42836,LIX,"That countless thanks were due to him, he said,"
42837,LIX,"And that at all times, as a debt of right,"
42838,LIX,His life should be for his advantage paid.
42839,LIX,"Of him he next demands, how he is hight,"
42840,LIX,That he may know and tell who brought him aid;
42841,LIX,"And among worthy warriors, and before"
42842,LIX,"King Charles, exalt his prowess evermore."
42843,LIX,
42844,LX,LX
42845,LX,"The stranger answered: ""Let it irk not thee"
42846,LX,That I not now my name to thee display;
42847,LX,"Ere longer by a yard the shadows be,"
42848,LX,"This will I signify; a short delay."""
42849,LX,"Wending together, they a river see"
42850,LX,"Whose murmurs woo the traveller from his way,"
42851,LX,"And shepherd-swain, by whiles, to their green brink;"
42852,LX,There an oblivion of their love to drink.
42853,LX,
42854,LXI,LXI
42855,LXI,"My lord, that fountain's chilling stream and clear"
42856,LXI,Extinguished love; Angelica of yore
42857,LXI,"Drinking thereof, for good Montalban's peer"
42858,LXI,Conceived that hate she nourished evermore;
42859,LXI,"And if she once displeased the cavalier,"
42860,LXI,"And he to her such passing hatred bore,"
42861,LXI,"For this no other cause occasion gave,"
42862,LXI,"My lord, save drinking of this chilly wave."
42863,LXI,
42864,LXII,LXII
42865,LXII,"Arriving at that limpid river's side,"
42866,LXII,"The cavalier that with Rinaldo goes,"
42867,LXII,"Reined-in his courser, how with toil, and cried,"
42868,LXII,"""Here 'twere not ill, meseemeth, to repose."""
42869,LXII,"-- ""It cannot but be well"" (the peer replied),"
42870,LXII,"""Because, beside that mid-day fiercely glows,"
42871,LXII,"I have so suffered from that hideous Pest,"
42872,LXII,"As sweet and needful shall I welcome rest."""
42873,LXII,
42874,LXIII,LXIII
42875,LXIII,"Upon the green sward lit the martial two,"
42876,LXIII,While their loose horses through the forest fed;
42877,LXIII,And from their brows the burnished helmets threw
42878,LXIII,"On that flowered herbage, yellow, green, and red."
42879,LXIII,"Rinaldo to the liquid crystal flew,"
42880,LXIII,By heat and thirst unto the river sped;
42881,LXIII,And with one draught of that cold liquid drove
42882,LXIII,Out of his burning bosom thirst and love.
42883,LXIII,
42884,LXIV,LXIV
42885,LXIV,"Whenas Rinaldo, sated with the draught,"
42886,LXIV,"Raising his head the stranger knight espied,"
42887,LXIV,"And saw that he, repentant, every thought"
42888,LXIV,"Of that so frantic love had put aside,"
42889,LXIV,"He reared himself, and said with semblance haught"
42890,LXIV,"That which he would not say before, and cried:"
42891,LXIV,"""Rinaldo, know that I am hight Disdain,"
42892,LXIV,"Bound hither but to break thy worthless chain."""
42893,LXIV,
42894,LXV,LXV
42895,LXV,"So saying, suddenly he passed from sight;"
42896,LXV,With him his horse: this in Rinaldo bred
42897,LXV,"Much wonderment; and the astonished knight,"
42898,LXV,"""Where is he?"" gazing round about him, said."
42899,LXV,"He cannot guess if 'twere a magic sprite,"
42900,LXV,"A fiend by Malagigi thither sped,"
42901,LXV,"From those his ministers, to break the chain,"
42902,LXV,Fettered whereby he lived so long in pain;
42903,LXV,
42904,LXVI,LXVI
42905,LXVI,Of if an angel from the heavenly sphere
42906,LXVI,"In his ineffable goodness by the Lord,"
42907,LXVI,"Dispatched, as to Tobias's aid whilere,"
42908,LXVI,A medicine for his blindness to afford.
42909,LXVI,But good or evil angel -- whatsoe'er
42910,LXVI,He was that him to liberty restored --
42911,LXVI,"Him thanked and praised Rinaldo, for a heart"
42912,LXVI,Healed only by his help of amorous smart.
42913,LXVI,
42914,LXVII,LXVII
42915,LXVII,Old hate revived upon Rinaldo's side;
42916,LXVII,"Nor he alone unworthy to be wooed,"
42917,LXVII,The damsel deemed by pilgrimage so wide
42918,LXVII,Her half a league he would not have pursued.
42919,LXVII,Nathless anew Baiardo to bestride
42920,LXVII,To Sericane would go that warrior good:
42921,LXVII,"As well because his honour him compelled,"
42922,LXVII,As for the talk which he with Charles had held.
42923,LXVII,
42924,LXVIII,LXVIII
42925,LXVIII,"He pricked to Basle upon the following day,"
42926,LXVIII,Whither the tidings had arrived before:
42927,LXVIII,"That Count Orlando was, in martial fray,"
42928,LXVIII,To meet Gradasso and the royal Moor:
42929,LXVIII,Nor through Orlando was divulged that say:
42930,LXVIII,"But one, who crost from the Sicilian shore,"
42931,LXVIII,"And thither had, in haste, the journey made,"
42932,LXVIII,"As certain news, the tidings had conveyed."
42933,LXVIII,
42934,LXIX,LXIX
42935,LXIX,"Rinaldo had gladly been at Roland's side,"
42936,LXIX,And from that battle far himself doth see:
42937,LXIX,"Every ten miles he changes horse and guide,"
42938,LXIX,"And whips and spurs, and makes his courser flee."
42939,LXIX,"He crost the Rhine at Constance, forward hied,"
42940,LXIX,"He traversed Alp, arrived in Italy,"
42941,LXIX,"He left Verona, Mantua, in his rear,"
42942,LXIX,"And reached and past the Po, with swift career."
42943,LXIX,
42944,LXX,LXX
42945,LXX,"Much towards eve already sloped the sun,"
42946,LXX,"And the first star was glimmering in the sky,"
42947,LXX,"When, doubting on the bank if he shall run"
42948,LXX,"Another course, or in some hostel lie"
42949,LXX,Until the shades of night and vapours dun
42950,LXX,"Before Aurora's beauteous visage fly,"
42951,LXX,"A cavalier approaching him he viewed,"
42952,LXX,Who courtesy in face and semblance shewed.
42953,LXX,
42954,LXXI,LXXI
42955,LXXI,"He, after greeting him, if he were tied"
42956,LXXI,"In wedlock, made in gentle wise demand."
42957,LXXI,"Rinaldo, wondering what the quest implied,"
42958,LXXI,"Made answer: ""I am bound in nuptial band."""
42959,LXXI,"-- ""I joy thereat,"" the cavalier replied;"
42960,LXXI,"Then, that he might this saying understand,"
42961,LXXI,"Added, ""I pray that you, sir knight, within"
42962,LXXI,My mansion will this eve be pleased to inn.
42963,LXXI,
42964,LXXII,LXXII
42965,LXXII,"""For I will make you see what must please"
42966,LXXII,"A wight"" (pursued the stranger) ""that is wed."""
42967,LXXII,"Rinaldo, as well that he would take his ease,"
42968,LXXII,"-- But this, with so long posting sore bested --"
42969,LXXII,As that to see and hear strange novelties
42970,LXXII,"By natural desire he still was led,"
42971,LXXII,"His offer takes, and enters a new road,"
42972,LXXII,Following that cavalier to his abode.
42973,LXXII,
42974,LXXIII,LXXIII
42975,LXXIII,"A bowshot from the way diverged the two,"
42976,LXXIII,And a great palace fronting them descried:
42977,LXXIII,Whence squires with blazing lights (a numerous crew)
42978,LXXIII,"Issued, and chased the darkness far and wide."
42979,LXXIII,"Entering, his eyes around Rinaldo threw,"
42980,LXXIII,"And saw a place, whose like is seldom spied,"
42981,LXXIII,"Of beauteous fabric, and well ordered plan;"
42982,LXXIII,Nor such huge cost befitted private man.
42983,LXXIII,
42984,LXXIV,LXXIV
42985,LXXIV,Of serpentine and of hard porphyry are
42986,LXXIV,The stones which form the gateway's arch above.
42987,LXXIV,"Of bronze the portal leaves, which figures bear,"
42988,LXXIV,Whose lively features seem to breathe and move.
42989,LXXIV,"Beneath the vaulted entry, colours rare"
42990,LXXIV,"Cheating the eye, in mixt mosaic strove,"
42991,LXXIV,"The quadrangle within was galleried,"
42992,LXXIV,"And of a hundred yards, on every side."
42993,LXXIV,
42994,LXXV,LXXV
42995,LXXV,"A gateway is there to each galleried row,"
42996,LXXV,"And, twixt it and that gate, an arch is bent;"
42997,LXXV,"Of equal breadth, but different in their show,"
42998,LXXV,For the architect had spared not ornament.
42999,LXXV,Each arch an entrance was; up which might go
43000,LXXV,A laden horse; so easy the ascent.
43001,LXXV,"To arch above leads every stair withal,"
43002,LXXV,And every arch is entrance to a hall.
43003,LXXV,
43004,LXXVI,LXXVI
43005,LXXVI,"Above, project the arches in such sort,"
43006,LXXVI,They for the spacious portals form a shade;
43007,LXXVI,And each two pillars has for its support:
43008,LXXVI,"Of bronze are some, and some of marble made."
43009,LXXVI,The ornamented chambers of the court
43010,LXXVI,Too many are to be at length displayed;
43011,LXXVI,"With easements, which (beside what is in sight)"
43012,LXXVI,The skilful master underground had dight.
43013,LXXVI,
43014,LXXVII,LXXVII
43015,LXXVII,"Tall columns, with their capitals of gold,"
43016,LXXVII,Which gemmed entablatures support in air;
43017,LXXVII,Exotic marbles engraved with figures fair;
43018,LXXVII,"Picture and cast, and works so manifold,"
43019,LXXVII,"Albeit by night they mostly hidden were,"
43020,LXXVII,Showed that two kings' united treasure ne'er
43021,LXXVII,Would have sufficed such gorgeous pile to rear.
43022,LXXVII,
43023,LXXVIII,LXXVIII
43024,LXXVIII,Above the beauteous ornaments and rich
43025,LXXVIII,"That mingled in that gay quadrangle meet,"
43026,LXXVIII,"There is a fresh and plenteous fountain, which"
43027,LXXVIII,"Scatters in many threads its watery sheet,"
43028,LXXVIII,"'Tis here that youths at equal distance pitch,"
43029,LXXVIII,"I' the middle, tables for the festive treat."
43030,LXXVIII,"Whence they four gates of that rich mansion see,"
43031,LXXVIII,And seen from those four gates as well may be.
43032,LXXVIII,
43033,LXXIX,LXXIX
43034,LXXIX,"By cunning master, diligent and wise,"
43035,LXXIX,"With much and subtle toil, the fount was made:"
43036,LXXIX,In open gallery or pavilion's guise;

44650,CXXXV,Ill-favoured -- such was Aesop feigned of yore:
44651,CXXXV,"If there, she would have saddened Paradise."
44652,CXXXV,Greasy and foul and beggarly her vest;

44659,CXXXVI,And she: `The owner of this house am I.'
44660,CXXXVI,"The judge was well assured the negress lied,"
44661,CXXXVI,And made that answer but in mockery:
44662,CXXXVI,But with repeated oaths the negress swears;
44663,CXXXVI,"'Tis hers, and none with her the mansions shares;"

44665,CXXXVII,CXXXVII
44666,CXXXVII,"""And would he see the palace, him invites"
44667,CXXXVII,To view it at his ease; and recommends
44668,CXXXVII,"If there be ought within which him delights,"
44669,CXXXVII,To take it for himself or for his friends.
44670,CXXXVII,"Anselmo hears, and from his horse alights,"
44671,CXXXVII,Gives it his man; and o'er the threshold wends;
44672,CXXXVII,"And by the hag conducted, mounts from hall"

44679,CXXXVIII,To buy the egregious mansion wound suffice.
44680,CXXXVIII,To him in answer said that negress old:
44681,CXXXVIII,"'And yet this dome, like others, hath its prize;"
44682,CXXXVIII,"If not in gold and silver, price less high"
44683,CXXXVIII,Than gold and silver will the palace buy':

44687,CXXXIX,Which erst Adonio to Argia made.
44688,CXXXIX,"A fool he deemed the woman and possest,"
44689,CXXXIX,Who for a boon so foul and filthy prayed.
44690,CXXXIX,"Yet ceased she not, though more than thrice represt;"
44691,CXXXIX,"And strove so well Anselmo to persuade,"
44692,CXXXIX,"Proffering, for his reward, the palace still,"
44693,CXXXIX,She wrought on him to do her evil will.

44730,CXLIII,This seemed a goodly bargain to her lord;

44739,CXLIV,"With fire, when of Anselmo's shame he heard."
44740,CXLIV,"Rinaldo greatly praised Argia's wit,"
44741,CXLIV,Who by such quaint device had trapped that bird;

44752,CXLV,"Argenta is come and gone, with circling walls"

44757,CXLVI,Which little cause of boast affords to Spain
44758,CXLVI,"(That there her banner has been raised on high),"
44759,CXLVI,And causes deeper sorrow to Romagne.
44760,CXLVI,"Thence in strait line their bark, that seems to fly,"
44761,CXLVI,To the right shore the boatmen drive amain:
44762,CXLVI,"Next through a stagnant channel make, that near"

44765,CXLVII,CXLVII
44766,CXLVII,"Though oft of money he had small supply,"

44769,CXLVII,"A parting present, ere farewell was said."
44770,CXLVII,"Here changing horse and guide, to Rimini"
44771,CXLVII,"Rinaldo rode that very eye, nor stayed"
44772,CXLVII,In Montefiore till the night was done;
44773,CXLVII,And well nigh reached Urbino with the sun.
44774,CXLVII,
44775,CXLVIII,CXLVIII
44776,CXLVIII,"Then Frederick was not there of gentle lore,"
44777,CXLVIII,Nor was Elizabeth nor Guido good;

44779,CXLVIII,"Who would in courteous, not in haughty mood,"
44780,CXLVIII,Have forced so famed a paladin for more
44781,CXLVIII,"Than one short eye, with them to make abode;"
44782,CXLVIII,"As they long did, and do unto this day,"
44783,CXLVIII,By dames and cavaliers who pass that way.
44784,CXLVIII,
44785,CXLIX,CXLIX
44786,CXLIX,"Since here none takes his rein, Rinaldo bends"
44787,CXLIX,"His course an-end to Cagli; o'er the height,"
44788,CXLIX,"Rifted by Gaurus and Metaurus, wends"
44789,CXLIX,"Past Apennine, no longer on his right,"
44790,CXLIX,Umbri and Tuscans; and at Rome descends.
44791,CXLIX,From Rome to Ostia goes Montalban's knight:
44792,CXLIX,Thence to the city sails; wherein a grave
44793,CXLIX,His pious son to old Anchises gave.
44794,CXLIX,
44795,CL,CL
44796,CL,There changes back; and thence in haste he goes
44797,CL,"Bound towards Lampedosa's island-shore,"
44798,CL,"That place of combat chosen by the foes,"
44799,CL,And where they had encountered Frank and Moor.
44800,CL,Rinaldo grants his boatmen no repose;
44801,CL,That do what can be done by sail and oar.
44802,CL,But with ill wind and strong the warrior strives;
44803,CL,"And, though by little, there too late arrives."
44804,CL,
44805,CLI,CLI
44806,CLI,Thither he came what time Anglante's peer
44807,CLI,The useful and the glorious deed had done;
44808,CLI,"Had slain those paynim kings in the career,"
44809,CLI,But had a hard and bloody conquest won:
44810,CLI,"Dead was Sir Brandimart; and Olivier,"
44811,CLI,"Dangerously hurt and sore, sate woe-begone,"
44812,CLI,"Somedeal apart, upon the sandy ground,"
44813,CLI,Martyred and crippled by his cruel wound.
44814,CLI,
44815,CLII,CLII
44816,CLII,"From tears could not the mournful Count refrain,"
44817,CLII,"When brave Rinaldo he embraced, and said,"
44818,CLII,How in the battle Brandimart was slain.
44819,CLII,"Such love, such faith endeared the warrior dead."
44820,CLII,Nor less Rinaldo's tears his visage stain
44821,CLII,When he so cleft beholds their comrade's head.
44822,CLII,"Thence to embrace bold Oliviero, where"
44823,CLII,"He sits with wounded foot, he makes repair."
44824,CLII,
44825,CLIII,CLIII
44826,CLIII,All comfort that he could he gave; though none
44827,CLIII,Could good Rinaldo to himself afford;
44828,CLIII,Because he came but when the feast was done;
44829,CLIII,Yea after the removal of the board.
44830,CLIII,"The servants wend to the demolished town,"
44831,CLIII,There hide the bones of either paynim lord
44832,CLIII,"Beneath Biserta's ruined domes, and nigh"
44833,CLIII,"And far, the fearful tidings certify."
44834,CLIII,
44835,CLIV,CLIV
44836,CLIV,"At the fair conquest won by Roland's blade,"
44837,CLIV,Sansonet and Astolpho make great cheer;
44838,CLIV,Yet other mirth those warriors would have made
44839,CLIV,Had Brandimart not perished; when they hear
44840,CLIV,"That he is dead, their joy is so allayed"
44841,CLIV,They can no more the troubled visage clear.
44842,CLIV,Which of them now the tidings of such woe
44843,CLIV,To the unhappy Flordelice shall show?
44844,CLIV,
44845,CLV,CLV
44846,CLV,The night preceding that ill-omened day
44847,CLV,Flordelice dreamed the vest of sable grain
44848,CLV,"That she had made, her husband to array,"
44849,CLV,"And woven with her hand and worked with pain,"
44850,CLV,Before her eyes all sprinkled-over lay
44851,CLV,"With ruddy drops, in guise of pattering rain."
44852,CLV,That she had worked it so the lady thought;
44853,CLV,And then was grieved at seeing what was wrought.
44854,CLV,
44855,CLVI,CLVI
44856,CLVI,"And seemed to say, ""Yet from my lord have I"
44857,CLVI,Command to make it all of sable hue;
44858,CLVI,Now wherefore it is stained with other dye
44859,CLVI,"Against his will, in mode so strange to view?"""
44860,CLVI,She from that dream draws evil augury;
44861,CLVI,And thither on that eve the tidings flew:
44862,CLVI,But these concealed Astolpho from the dame
44863,CLVI,Till he to her with Sansonetto came.
44864,CLVI,
44865,CLVII,CLVII
44866,CLVII,"When they are entered, and she sees no show"
44867,CLVII,"Of joyful triumphs, she, without a word,"
44868,CLVII,"Without a hint to indicate that woe,"
44869,CLVII,Knows that no longer living is her lord.
44870,CLVII,"With that her gentle heart was riven so,"
44871,CLVII,"And so her harassed eyes the light abhorred,"
44872,CLVII,"And so was every other sense astound,"
44873,CLVII,"That, like one dead, she sank upon the ground."
44874,CLVII,
44875,CLVIII,CLVIII
44876,CLVIII,"She in her hair, when life returns again,"
44877,CLVIII,"Fastens her hand; and on her lovely cheeks,"
44878,CLVIII,"Repeating the beloved name in vain,"
44879,CLVIII,With all her force her scorn and fury wreaks;
44880,CLVIII,"Uproots and tears, her locks, and in her pain"
44881,CLVIII,"Like woman, smit by evil demon, shrieks,"
44882,CLVIII,"Or, as Bacchante at the horn's rude sound,"
44883,CLVIII,Erewhile was seen to run her restless round.
44884,CLVIII,
44885,CLIX,CLIX
44886,CLIX,"Now to the one, to the other now her prayer"
44887,CLIX,"She made for knife, wherewith her heart to smite;"
44888,CLIX,Now she aboard the pinnace would repair
44889,CLIX,"That brought the corse of either paynim knight,"
44890,CLIX,"And would on either, lifeless as they were,"
44891,CLIX,"Do cruel scathe, and vent her fierce despite."
44892,CLIX,"Now would she seek her lord, till at his side"
44893,CLIX,"She rested from her weary search, and died."
44894,CLIX,
44895,CLX,CLX
44896,CLX,"""Ah!  wherefore, Brandimart, did I let thee"
44897,CLX,Without me wend on such a dire emprize?
44898,CLX,"She ne'er before did thy departure see,"
44899,CLX,"But Flordelice aye followed thee,"" she cries:"
44900,CLX,"""Well aided mightest thou have been by me;"
44901,CLX,For I on thee should still have kept my eyes;
44902,CLX,"And when Gradasso came behind thee, I"
44903,CLX,Thee might have succoured with a single cry;
44904,CLX,
44905,CLXI,CLXI
44906,CLXI,"""And haply I so nimbly might have made"
44907,CLXI,"Between you, that the stroke I might have caught,"
44908,CLXI,"And with my head, as with a buckler, stayed:"
44909,CLXI,For little ill my dying would have wrought.
44910,CLXI,Anyhow I shall die; and -- that debt paid --
44911,CLXI,My melancholy death will profit nought:
44912,CLXI,"When, had I died, defending thee in strife,"
44913,CLXI,I could not better have bestowed my life.
44914,CLXI,
44915,CLXII,CLXII
44916,CLXII,"""Even is averse had been hard Destiny,"
44917,CLXII,"And all heaven's host, when thee I sought to aid,"
44918,CLXII,"At least my tears had bathed thy visage, I"
44919,CLXII,"Should the last kiss thereon, at least, have laid;"
44920,CLXII,"And, ere amid the blessed hierarchy"
44921,CLXII,"Thy spirit mixt, `Depart' -- I should have said --"
44922,CLXII,"`In peace, and wait me in thy rest; for there,"
44923,CLXII,"Where'er thou art, I swiftly shall repair.'"

44927,CLXIII,Whose honoured sceptre thou wast now to take?
44928,CLXIII,"With thee to Dommogire, thy fair domain,"
44929,CLXIII,Thus went I; me thus welcome dost thou make?
44930,CLXIII,Alas!  what hope to-day thou renderest vain!
44931,CLXIII,"Ah!  what designs, fell Fortune, dost thou break!"
44932,CLXIII,"Ah!  wherefore fear I, since a lot so blest,"
44933,CLXIII,"Is lost, to lose as well the worthless rest?"""
44934,CLXIII,
44935,CLXIV,CLXIV
44936,CLXIV,"Repeating this and other plaint, so spite"
44937,CLXIV,"And fury waxed, that she in her despair"
44938,CLXIV,"Made new assault upon her tresses bright,"
44939,CLXIV,As if the fault was wholly in her hair:
44940,CLXIV,"Wildly her hands together doth she smite,"
44941,CLXIV,And gnaw; with nails her lip and bosom tear.
44942,CLXIV,But I return to Roland and his peers;
44943,CLXIV,While she bemoans herself and melts in tears.
44944,CLXIV,
44945,CLXV,CLXV
44946,CLXV,"Roland with Olivier, who much requires"
44947,CLXV,"Such leech's care, his anguish to allay;"
44948,CLXV,"And who, himself, some worthy place desires"
44949,CLXV,"As much, wherein Sir Brandimart to lay,"
44950,CLXV,"Steers for the lofty mountain, that with fires"
44951,CLXV,"Brightens the night, with smoke obscures the day."
44952,CLXV,"The wind blows fair, and on the starboard hand,"
44953,CLXV,"Not widely distant from them, lies that land."
44954,CLXV,
44955,CLXVI,CLXVI
44956,CLXVI,"With a fresh wind, that in their favour blows,"
44957,CLXVI,They loose their hawser at the close of day:
44958,CLXVI,In heaven above the silent goddess shows
44959,CLXVI,"Her shining horn, to guide them on their way;"
44960,CLXVI,And on the following morn before them rose
44961,CLXVI,The pleasant shores that round Girgenti lay.
44962,CLXVI,Here Roland orders for the ensuing night
44963,CLXVI,All that is needful for the funeral rite.
44964,CLXVI,
44965,CLXVII,CLXVII
44966,CLXVII,"He, when he saw his order duly done,"
44967,CLXVII,And now the westering sun's fair light was spent.
44968,CLXVII,"With many nobles, who from neighbouring town,"
44969,CLXVII,"At his invital, to Girgenti went,"
44970,CLXVII,"-- The shore with torches blazing up and down,"
44971,CLXVII,"And sounding wide with cries and loud lament, --"
44972,CLXVII,"Thither returned where late, of life bereft,"
44973,CLXVII,"His friends, beloved in life and death, was left."
44974,CLXVII,
44975,CLXVIII,CLXVIII
44976,CLXVIII,"There stands Bardino, weeping o'er the bier,"
44977,CLXVIII,Who under Age's heavy burden bows;
44978,CLXVIII,"Who, in the tears on shipboard shed whilere."
44979,CLXVIII,Might well have wept away his eyes and brows:
44980,CLXVIII,"Upbraiding skies and stars, the cavalier,"
44981,CLXVIII,"Like lion, in whose veins a fever glows,"
44982,CLXVIII,Roars as he wreathes his wayward hands within
44983,CLXVIII,"His hoary hair, and rends his wrinkled skin."
44984,CLXVIII,
44985,CLXIX,CLXIX
44986,CLXIX,Upon the paladin's return the cry
44987,CLXIX,"Redoubled, and the mourning louder grew"
44988,CLXIX,"Orlando to the corse approached more nigh,"
44989,CLXIX,"And speechless stood awhile, his friends to view,"
44990,CLXIX,"Pale, as at eve is the acanthus' dye"
44991,CLXIX,"Or lily's, which were plucked at morn: he drew"
44992,CLXIX,"A heavy sigh, and on the warrior dead"
44993,CLXIX,"Fixing his stedfast eyes, the County said:"

45000,CLXX,"Forgive, if thou beholdest me complain:"
45001,CLXX,"Because I sorrow to remain below,"
45002,CLXX,And not to share in such delights with thee;
45003,CLXX,Not that thou art not left behind with me.

45005,CLXXI,CLXXI
45006,CLXXI,"""Alone, without thee, there is nought I may"

45008,CLXXI,"If still with thee in tempest and affray,"
45009,CLXXI,Ah wherefore not with thee in calm and ease?
45010,CLXXI,"Right sore must be my trespass, since this clay"
45011,CLXXI,Will not to follow thee my soul release.
45012,CLXXI,"If in thy troubles still I bore a burden,"
45013,CLXXI,Why am I not a partner of thy guerdon?
45014,CLXXI,
45015,CLXXII,CLXXII
45016,CLXXII,"""Thine is the guerdon; mine the loss; thy gain"
45017,CLXXII,Is single; but not single is my woe:
45018,CLXXII,"Partners with me in sorrow are Almayne,"
45019,CLXXII,And grieving France and Italy; and oh!
45020,CLXXII,"How will my lord and uncle, Charlemagne,"
45021,CLXXII,How will his paladins lament the blow!
45022,CLXXII,"How will the Christian church and empire moan,"

45025,CLXXIII,CLXXIII
45026,CLXXIII,"""Oh!  how thy foes will by the death of thee"
45027,CLXXIII,Be freed henceforward from alarm and fear!
45028,CLXXIII,Alas!  how strengthened paynimry will be!
45029,CLXXIII,What hardiment will now be theirs!  what cheer!
45030,CLXXIII,What of thy consort will become?  I see
45031,CLXXIII,"Even here her mourning, and her outcries hear."
45032,CLXXIII,"Me she accuses, haply hates, I know;"
45033,CLXXIII,"In that, through me, her every hope lies low."
45034,CLXXIII,
45035,CLXXIV,CLXXIV
45036,CLXXIV,"""Yet by one comfort, Flordelice, is followed"
45037,CLXXIV,"His loss, for us that reft of him remain:"

45050,CLXXV,"And they to God for the departed prayed,"
45051,CLXXV,That he would to his rest his soul convey.
45052,CLXXV,"Before and all about were torches reared,"

45058,CLXXVI,"The pall was purple silk, with broidery rare"
45059,CLXXVI,"Of gold, and pearls in costly circles dight."
45060,CLXXVI,"Thereon, of lordly work and no less fair,"
45061,CLXXVI,"Cushions were laid, with jewels shining bright."
45062,CLXXVI,"On which was stretched the lifeless knight in view,"
45063,CLXXVI,Arrayed in vest of like device and hue.
45064,CLXXVI,
45065,CLXXVII,CLXXVII
45066,CLXXVII,"A hundred men had past before the rest,"
45067,CLXXVII,All taken from the poorest of the town;
45068,CLXXVII,And in one fashion equally were drest
45069,CLXXVII,"Those beadsmen all, in black and trailing gown."
45070,CLXXVII,"A hundred pages followed them, who prest"
45071,CLXXVII,"A hundred puissant steeds, for warfare bown;"

45105,CLXXXI,CLXXXI
45106,CLXXXI,"He in the church was placed; and, when with vain"

45109,CLXXXI,"And other holy orisons were said,"
45110,CLXXXI,"In a fair ark, upraised on columns twain,"
45111,CLXXXI,"Was reared, with sumptuous cloth of gold o'erspread."
45112,CLXXXI,So willed Orlando; till he could be laid
45113,CLXXXI,In sepulchre of costlier matter made:
45114,CLXXXI,
45115,CLXXXII,CLXXXII
45116,CLXXXII,"Nor out of Sicily the Count departs,"
45117,CLXXXII,"Till porphyries he procures and alabasters,"

45120,CLXXXII,"Next Flordelice, arriving in those parts,"
45121,CLXXXII,Raises the quarried slabs and rich pilasters;
45122,CLXXXII,"Who, good Orlando being gone before,"

45130,CLXXXIII,Vows in her heart she thence will never go
45131,CLXXXIII,Till from the wearied corse her soul expires;
45132,CLXXXIII,And builds in that fair sepulchre a cell;
45133,CLXXXIII,There shuts herself; therein for life will dwell.

45135,CLXXXIV,CLXXXIV
45136,CLXXXIV,"Thither in person, having courier sent"

45141,CLXXXIV,On journeying to her father; for her sake
45142,CLXXXIV,"If wholly she to serve her God was willed,"
45143,CLXXXIV,A monastery would the warrior build.
45144,CLXXXIV,
45145,CLXXXV,CLXXXV
45146,CLXXXV,"Still in that sepulchre she dwelt, and worn"
45147,CLXXXV,"By weary penance, praying night and day,"
45148,CLXXXV,"It was not long, ere by the Parcae shorn"
45149,CLXXXV,Was her life's thread: already on their way
45150,CLXXXV,"Were the three Christian warriors, homeward borne,"
45151,CLXXXV,Sorrowing and afflicted sore in mind
45152,CLXXXV,For their fourth comrade who remained behind.
45153,CLXXXV,
45154,CLXXXVI,CLXXXVI
45155,CLXXXVI,"They would not go without a leech, whose skill"
45156,CLXXXVI,Might ease the wound of warlike Olivier;
45157,CLXXXVI,"Which, as in the beginning it could ill"
45158,CLXXXVI,"Be salved, is hard to heal.  Meanwhile they hear"
45159,CLXXXVI,"The champion so complain, his outcries fill"
45160,CLXXXVI,Orlando and all that company with fear.
45161,CLXXXVI,"While they discoursed thereon, the skipper, moved"

45163,CLXXXVI,
45164,CLXXXVII,CLXXXVII
45165,CLXXXVII,"A hermit not far distance hence, he said"
45166,CLXXXVII,A lonely rock inhabits in this sea;
45167,CLXXXVII,"Whose isle none, seeking succour, vainly tread,"
45168,CLXXXVII,Whether for counsel or for aid it be:
45169,CLXXXVII,Who hath done superhuman deeds; the dead
45170,CLXXXVII,Restores to life; and makes the blind to see;
45171,CLXXXVII,Hushes the winds; and with a sign o' the cross
45172,CLXXXVII,Lulls the loud billows when they highest toss;
45173,CLXXXVII,
45174,CLXXXVIII,CLXXXVIII
45175,CLXXXVIII,"And adds they need not doubt, if they will go"
45176,CLXXXVIII,"To seek that holy man to God so dear,"
45177,CLXXXVIII,But he on Olivier will health bestow;
45178,CLXXXVIII,Having his virtue proved by signs more clear.
45179,CLXXXVIII,"This counsel pleases good Orlando so,"
45180,CLXXXVIII,That for the holy place he bids him steer;
45181,CLXXXVIII,"Who never swerving from his course, espies"
45182,CLXXXVIII,"The lonely rock, upon Aurora's rise."
45183,CLXXXVIII,
45184,CLXXXIX,CLXXXIX
45185,CLXXXIX,"Worked by good mariners, the bark was laid"
45186,CLXXXIX,Safely beside the rugged rock and fell:
45187,CLXXXIX,"The marquis there, with crew and servants' aid,"
45188,CLXXXIX,They lowered into their boat; and through the swell
45189,CLXXXIX,And foaming waters in that shallop made
45190,CLXXXIX,For the rude isle; thence sought the holy cell;
45191,CLXXXIX,"The holy cell of that same hermit hoar,"
45192,CLXXXIX,By whom Rogero was baptized before.
45193,CLXXXIX,
45194,CXC,CXC
45195,CXC,The servant of the Lord of Paradise
45196,CXC,Receives Orlando and the rest on land;
45197,CXC,Blesses the company in cheerful wise;
45198,CXC,And after of their errand makes demand;
45199,CXC,Though he already had received advice
45200,CXC,From angels of the coming of that band.
45201,CXC,That they were thither bound in search of aid
45202,CXC,"For Oliviero's hurt, Orlando said;"
45203,CXC,
45204,CXCI,CXCI
45205,CXCI,"Who, warring for the Christian faith, in fight"
45206,CXCI,To perilous pass was brought by evil wound.
45207,CXCI,"All dismal fear relieved that eremite,"
45208,CXCI,And promised he would make him wholly sound.
45209,CXCI,"In that no unguents hath the holy wight,"
45210,CXCI,"Nor is in other human medicine found,"
45211,CXCI,"His church he seeks, his knee to Jesus bows,"
45212,CXCI,And issues from the fane with cheerful brows;
45213,CXCI,
45214,CXCII,CXCII
45215,CXCII,"And in the name of those eternal Three,"
45216,CXCII,"The Father, and the Son, and Holy Ghost,"
45217,CXCII,On Oliviero bade his blessing be.
45218,CXCII,Oh!  grace vouchsafed to faith!  his sainted host
45219,CXCII,From every pain the paladin did free;
45220,CXCII,And to his foot restored its vigour lost.
45221,CXCII,"He moved more nimble than before, and sure;"
45222,CXCII,And present was Sobrino at the cure.
45223,CXCII,
45224,CXCIII,CXCIII
45225,CXCIII,"Sobrino, so diseased that he described"
45226,CXCIII,"How worse with each succeeding day he grew,"
45227,CXCIII,As soon as he that holy monk espied
45228,CXCIII,"The manifest and mighty marvel do,"
45229,CXCIII,"Disposed himself to cast Mahound aside,"
45230,CXCIII,And own in Christ a living God and true.
45231,CXCIII,"He, full of faith, with contrite heart demands"
45232,CXCIII,Our holy rite of baptism at his hands.
45233,CXCIII,
45234,CXCIV,CXCIV
45235,CXCIV,So him baptized the hermit; and as well
45236,CXCIV,That monarch made as vigorous as whilere.
45237,CXCIV,At this conversion no less gladness fell
45238,CXCIV,"On Roland and each Christian cavalier,"
45239,CXCIV,"Than when, restored from deadly wound, and well"
45240,CXCIV,The friendly troop beheld Sir Olivier.
45241,CXCIV,Rogero more rejoiced than all that crew;
45242,CXCIV,And still in faith and grace the warrior grew.
45243,CXCIV,
45244,CXCV,CXCV
45245,CXCV,Rogero from the day he swam ashore
45246,CXCV,"Upon that islet, there had ever been."
45247,CXCV,"That band is counselled by the hermit hoar,"
45248,CXCV,"Who stands, benign, those warlike knights between,"
45249,CXCV,"Eschewing in their passage mire and moor,"
45250,CXCV,"To wade withal through that dead water, clean,"
45251,CXCV,Which men call life; wherein so fools delight;
45252,CXCV,And evermore on heaven to fix their sight.

45255,CXCVI,"Roland on shipboard sends one from his throng,"

45258,CXCVI,"All taste of partridge since on fruits he fed,"
45259,CXCVI,"Even do for love, what others did, among"
45260,CXCVI,Those social guests for whom the board was spread.
45261,CXCVI,"They, when their strength by food was reinforced,"
45262,CXCVI,Of many things amid themselves discoursed;
45263,CXCVI,
45264,CXCVII,CXCVII
45265,CXCVII,And as in talk it often doth befall
45266,CXCVII,"That one thing from another takes its rise,"
45267,CXCVII,Roland and Olivier Rogero call
45268,CXCVII,"To mind for that Rogero, in such wise"
45269,CXCVII,Renowned in arms; whose valour is of all
45270,CXCVII,Lauded and echoed with accordant cries.
45271,CXCVII,Not even had Rinaldo known the knight
45272,CXCVII,For him whose prowess he had proved in fight.
45273,CXCVII,
45274,CXCVIII,CXCVIII
45275,CXCVIII,"Him well Sobrino recognized whilere,"
45276,CXCVIII,As soon as with that aged man espied;
45277,CXCVIII,But he at first kept silence; for in fear
45278,CXCVIII,Of some mistake the monarch's tongue was tied.
45279,CXCVIII,But when those others knew the cavalier
45280,CXCVIII,"For that Rogero, famous far and wide,"
45281,CXCVIII,"Whose courtesy, whose might and daring through"
45282,CXCVIII,"The universal world loud Rumor blew,"
45283,CXCVIII,
45284,CXCIX,CXCIX
45285,CXCIX,"All, for they know he is a Christian, stand"
45286,CXCIX,About him with serene and joyful face:
45287,CXCIX,All press upon the knight; one grasps his hand;
45288,CXCIX,Another locks him fast in his embrace:
45289,CXCIX,Yet more than all the others of that band
45290,CXCIX,Him would Montalban's lord caress and grace:
45291,CXCIX,Why more than all the others will appear
45292,CXCIX,"In other strain, if you that strain will hear."

45364,VI,Than any knight that e'er laid lance in rest:

45417,XI,
45418,XII,XII

45420,XII,"Nor knew that Aymon, with King Charles' consent,"
45421,XII,Unto the Grecian emperor Constantine
45422,XII,To give his gentle daughter had intent;
45423,XII,"Who for young Leo, of his lofty line"
45424,XII,"The heir and hope, to crave the maid had sent."
45425,XII,"Such warmth the praises of her worth inspired,"
45426,XII,With love of her unseen was Leo fired.
45427,XII,
45428,XIII,XIII
45429,XIII,"To him hath Aymon answered: he, alone,"
45430,XIII,"Cannot conclude thereon in other sort,"
45431,XIII,"Until he first hath spoken with his son,"
45432,XIII,"Rinaldo, absent then from Charles's court;"
45433,XIII,"Who with winged haste, he deems, will thither run,"
45434,XIII,And joy in kinsman of such high report;
45435,XIII,"But from the high regard he bears his heir,"
45436,XIII,Can nought resolve till thither he repair.
45437,XIII,
45438,XIV,XIV
45439,XIV,"Now good Rinaldo, of his father wide,"
45440,XIV,"And of the imperial practice knowing nought,"
45441,XIV,"Promised his beauteous sister as a bride,"
45442,XIV,"Upon his own, as well as Roland's thought"
45443,XIV,"And the others, harboured in that cell beside;"
45444,XIV,But most of all on him the hermit wrought;
45445,XIV,"And by such marriage, 'twas the peer's belief,"
45446,XIV,He could not choose but pleasure Clermont's chief.
45447,XIV,
45448,XV,XV
45449,XV,"That day and night, and of the following day"
45450,XV,"Great part, with that sage monk the warriors spent;"
45451,XV,"Scarce mindful that the crew their coming stay,"
45452,XV,"Albeit the wind blew fair for their intent,"
45453,XV,"But these, impatient at their long delay,"
45454,XV,More than one message to the warriors sent;
45455,XV,"And to return those barons urged so sore,"
45456,XV,Parforce they parted from the hermit hoar.
45457,XV,
45458,XVI,XVI
45459,XVI,"The Child who, so long banished, had not stayed"
45460,XVI,"From the lone rock, whereon the waters roared,"
45461,XVI,"His farewell to that holy master made,"
45462,XVI,Who taught him the true faith: anew with sword
45463,XVI,"Orlando girt his side, and with the blade,"
45464,XVI,Frontino and martial Hector's arms restored;
45465,XVI,"As knowing horse and arms were his whilere,"
45466,XVI,As well as out of kindness to the peer;
45467,XVI,
45468,XVII,XVII
45469,XVII,"And, though the enchanted sword with better right"
45470,XVII,"Would have been worn by good Anglantes' chief,"
45471,XVII,Who from the fearful garden by his might
45472,XVII,"Had won the blade with mickle toil and grief,"
45473,XVII,"Than by Rogero, who that faulchion bright"
45474,XVII,"Received with good Frontino, from the thief,"
45475,XVII,"He willingly thereof, as with the rest,"
45476,XVII,"As soon as asked, the warrior repossest."

45478,XVIII,XVIII
45479,XVIII,The hermit blessings on the band implores:
45480,XVIII,They to their bark in fine return; their sails
45481,XVIII,"Give to the winds, and to the waves their oars;"
45482,XVIII,"And such clear skies they have and gentle gales,"
45483,XVIII,Nor vow nor prayer the patron makes; and moors
45484,XVIII,His pinnace in the haven of Marseilles.
45485,XVIII,"There, safely harboured, let the chiefs remain,"
45486,XVIII,Till I conduct Astolpho to that train.

45489,XIX,"When of that bloody, dear-brought victory"
45490,XIX,"The scarcely joyful tale Astolpho knew,"
45491,XIX,"He, seeing evermore fair France would be"
45492,XIX,"Secure from mischief from the Moorish crew,"
45493,XIX,Homeward to send the king of Aethiopy
45494,XIX,"Devised, together with his army, through"
45495,XIX,"The sandy desert, by the self-same track,"
45496,XIX,Through which he led them to Biserta's sack.

45499,XX,"Erewhile restored, in Afric waters ride"
45500,XX,Sir Dudon's ships which did the paynims rout;
45501,XX,"Whose prows (new miracle!) and poop, and side,"
45502,XX,"As soon as all their sable crews are out,"
45503,XX,"Are changed anew to leaves; which far and wide,"
45504,XX,"Raised by a sudden breeze, are blown about;"

45511,XXI,"But to their king, first, thanks Astolpho paid,"
45512,XXI,"And said, he an eternal debt should owe;"
45513,XXI,In that he had in person given him aid
45514,XXI,With all his might and main against the foe.
45515,XXI,"The skins Astolpho gave them, which confined"
45516,XXI,The turbid and tempestuous southern wind.
45517,XXI,
45518,XXII,XXII
45519,XXII,"I say, enclosed in skins that wind he gave,"
45520,XXII,"Which in such fury blows at noon, on high"
45521,XXII,"I moves the shifting plain in many a wave,"
45522,XXII,"And fills the eddying sand the troubled sky,"
45523,XXII,"To carry with them, and from scathe to save"
45524,XXII,"Their squadrons, lest the dusty whirlwind fly;"
45525,XXII,"And bids them, when arrived at home, unnoose"

45532,XXIII,So that the steeds return to what they were.
45533,XXIII,But it is time the Duke to France was gone;
45534,XXIII,"Who having thus provided, in his care,"
45535,XXIII,"For the main places in the Moorish land,"
45536,XXIII,Made the hippogryph anew his wings expand;
45537,XXIII,
45538,XXIV,XXIV
45539,XXIV,"He reached Sardinia at one flight and shear,"
45540,XXIV,Corsica from Sardinia; and then o'er
45541,XXIV,"The foaming sea his venturous course did steer,"
45542,XXIV,Inclining somewhat left the griffin's soar.
45543,XXIV,In the sea-marshes last his light career
45544,XXIV,"He stopt, on rich Provence's pleasant shore:"
45545,XXIV,Where to the hyppogryph by him is done
45546,XXIV,What was erewhile enjoined by sainted John.
45547,XXIV,
45548,XXV,XXV
45549,XXV,"To him the charge did sainted John commit,"

45553,XXV,"Already had the planet, whither flit"
45554,XXV,"Things lost on earth, of sound deprived his horn:"
45555,XXV,"For this not only hoarse but mute remained,"
45556,XXV,As soon as the holy place Astolpho gained.

45559,XXVI,Thence to Marseilles he came; and came the day
45560,XXVI,"Orlando, and Rinaldo, and Olivier"
45561,XXVI,"Arrived therein, upon their homeward way,"
45562,XXVI,"With good Sobrino, and the better peer,"
45563,XXVI,"Rogero: not so triumphs that array,"
45564,XXVI,"Touched by the death of him, their comrade dear,"
45565,XXVI,As they for such a glorious victory won
45566,XXVI,-- But for that sad disaster -- would have done.

45569,XXVII,"Of the kings slain upon the paynim part,"

45573,XXVII,"Charles stood with jocund fate and gladsome heart,"
45574,XXVII,Rejoicing he had from his shoulders thrown
45575,XXVII,The intolerable load whereof the weight

45592,XXIX,Mongrana and Clermont's cry the welkin rends.
45593,XXIX,"No sooner, mid that kind and festal show,"
45594,XXIX,"The interchange of fond embracements ends,"
45595,XXIX,"Than Roland and his friends Rogero bring,"

45603,XXX,"Meanwhile, the noble and the lovely pair,"
45604,XXX,Marphisa and gentle Bradamant appear.

45613,XXXI,"The warrior honour, mid his martial train:"
45614,XXXI,How the true faith he had embraced he knew;

45617,XXXI,
45618,XXXII,XXXII
45619,XXXII,With pomp triumphal and with festive cheer
45620,XXXII,The troop returns within the city-walls:
45621,XXXII,"With leaves and garlands green the streets appear,"
45622,XXXII,And tapestried all about with gorgeous palls.
45623,XXXII,"Of herbs and flowers a mingled rain, where'er"
45624,XXXII,"They wend, upon the conquering squadron falls,"
45625,XXXII,Which with full hands from stand and window throw

45642,XXXIV,"Which scarce found room, begirt with dames and knight,"
45643,XXXIV,"The mighty emperor, mid those greetings loud."
45644,XXXIV,Before the royal palace did alight:
45645,XXXIV,Where many days he feasted high in hall
45646,XXXIV,"His lords, mid tourney, mummery, mask and ball."

45658,XXXVI,XXXVI
45659,XXXVI,Duke Aymon heard his heir with some disdain;
45660,XXXVI,"That, without concert with him, and alone"

45672,XXXVII,To break Rogero's match with Bradamant;
45673,XXXVII,Resolved to tax her every means and might
45674,XXXVII,To make her empress of the wide Levant.
45675,XXXVII,"Firm in his purpose is Montalban's lord,"

45679,XXXVIII,Beatrice who believes the highminded fair
45680,XXXVIII,"Is at her hest, exhorts her to reply,"

45691,XXXIX,"To whom such reverence, and respect, she bears,"
45692,XXXIX,She thinks no choice is left but to obey.
45693,XXXIX,"Yet a foul fault it in her eyes appears,"
45694,XXXIX,"If what she will not do, she falsely say:"

46113,LXXXI,Leo meanwhile was from the river gone
46114,LXXXI,"With covert guile; he took a circuit wide,"
46115,LXXXI,Then thither made return; his bridges placed

46173,LXXXVII,"At throat, at breast and flank the warrior laid;"
46174,LXXXVII,"Smote hand, and arm, and shoulder, bust, and thigh;"

46179,LXXXVIII,None that behold those strokes maintain their place;

46183,LXXXVIII,"The Bulgar squadrons rally, turn, and chase"
46184,LXXXVIII,The Grecian troops that fled from them whilere.

46666,XXXI,That she had nursed suspicion and affright;
46667,XXXI,"And she, as her Rogero were in view,"
46668,XXXI,"Would blame herself, and would her bosom smite;"
46669,XXXI,"And say: ""I see 'twas ill such thoughts to nurse,"
46670,XXXI,"But he, the cause, is even cause of worse."

46672,XXXII,XXXII
46673,XXXII,"""Love is the cause; that in my heart inlaid"
46674,XXXII,"Thy form, so graceful and so fair to see;"
46675,XXXII,"And so thy darling and thy wit pourtrayed,"
46676,XXXII,"And worth, of all so bruited, that to me"
46677,XXXII,"It seems impossible that wife or maid,"
46678,XXXII,"Blest with thy sight, should not be fired by thee;"
46679,XXXII,And that she should not all her art apply
46680,XXXII,"To unbind, and fasten thee with other tie."

46682,XXXIII,XXXIII
46683,XXXIII,"""Ah!  wellaway!  if in my thought Love so"

46685,XXXIII,"This -- am I well assured -- in open show,"
46686,XXXIII,"As I unseen believe it, should I find;"
46687,XXXIII,"And be so quit of Jealousy, that foe"
46688,XXXIII,Would not still harass my suspicious mind;
46689,XXXIII,"And, where she is by me repulsed with pain,"
46690,XXXIII,"Not quelled and routed would she be, but slain."

46693,XXXIV,"""I am like miser, so intent on gear,"
46694,XXXIV,"And who hath this so buried in his heart,"
46695,XXXIV,"That he, for hoarded treasure still in fear,"
46696,XXXIV,Cannot live gladly from his wealth apart.
46697,XXXIV,"Since I Rogero neither see nor hear,"
46698,XXXIV,"More puissant far than Hope, O Fear!  thou art;"
46699,XXXIV,"To thee, though false and idle I give way;"
46700,XXXIV,And cannot choose but yield myself thy prey.
46701,XXXIV,
46702,XXXV,XXXV
46703,XXXV,"""But I, Rogero, shall no sooner spy"
46704,XXXV,"The light of thy glad countenance appear,"

46706,XXXV,"Concealed (and woe is me), I know not where, --"
46707,XXXV,Oh!  how true Hope false Fear shall from on high
46708,XXXV,"Depose withal, and to the bottom bear!"
46709,XXXV,"Ah!  turn to me, Rogero!  turn again,"
46710,XXXV,"And comfort Hope, whom Fear hath almost slain."

46713,XXXVI,"""As when the sun withdraws his glittering head,"
46714,XXXVI,"The shadows lengthen, causing vain affright;"
46715,XXXVI,"And as the shadows, when he leaves his bed,"
46716,XXXVI,"Vanish, and reassure the timid wight:"
46717,XXXVI,Without Rogero so I suffer dread;
46718,XXXVI,"Dread lasts not, if Rogero is in sight."
46719,XXXVI,"Return to me, return, Rogero, lest"
46720,XXXVI,My hope by fear should wholly be opprest.
46721,XXXVI,
46722,XXXVII,XXXVII
46723,XXXVII,"""As every spark is in the night alive,"
46724,XXXVII,And suddenly extinguished when 'tis morn;
46725,XXXVII,"When me my sun doth of his rays deprive,"
46726,XXXVII,Against me felon Fear uplifts his horn:
46727,XXXVII,"But they the shades of night no sooner drive,"
46728,XXXVII,"Than Fears are past and gone, and Hopes return."
46729,XXXVII,"Return, alas!  return, O radiance dear!"

46757,XL,"Oh!  how -- oh!  how much worse would be her woe,"
46758,XL,If what she knew not to the maid were known!
46759,XL,"That, prisoned and with pain and pine consumed,"
46760,XL,Her consort to a cruel death was doomed.

46763,XLI,The cruelty which by that beldam ill
46764,XLI,"Was practised on the prisoned cavalier,"

46766,XLI,"By torture new and pains unused whilere,"
46767,XLI,"While so Rogero pined, the gracious will"
46768,XLI,Of Heaven conveyed to gentle Leo's ear;

46775,XLII,"Rogero was, but by that valour moved"
46776,XLII,"Which sole and superhuman seemed to be,"
46777,XLII,"Thought much, and mused, and planned, how it behoved"
46778,XLII,-- And found at last a way -- to set him free;
46779,XLII,So that his cruel aunt should have no right

46781,XLII,
46782,XLIII,XLIII
46783,XLIII,"In secret, Leo with the man that bore"

46787,XLIII,"When it was night, one, faithful found of yore,"
46788,XLIII,"Bold, strong, and good in brawl, he thither led;"
46789,XLIII,And -- by the silent warder taught that none

46791,XLIII,
46792,XLIV,XLIV
46793,XLIV,"Leo, escorted by none else beside,"
46794,XLIV,"Was led by the compliant castellain,"
46795,XLIV,"With his companion, to the tower, where stied"
46796,XLIV,"Was he, reserved for nature's latest pain."
46797,XLIV,"There round the neck of their unwary guide,"

46808,XLV,Less than a palm's breadth of the water clear:
46809,XLV,"To kill him in a month, or briefer space,"

46812,XLVI,XLVI

46836,XLVIII,"""Infinite thanks I owe you,"" cries the thrall,"
46837,XLVIII,"""And I the life you gave me, for your use"

46846,XLIX,"Leo the warrior, free from bondage base,"
46847,XLIX,"Brings home, and there in safety to remain"
46848,XLIX,"Persuades, in secret, four or six days' space:"

46855,L,Some think that these or those had helped his flight:
46856,L,All talk; and yet the truth is guessed by none.
46857,L,Well may they think by any other wight
46858,L,Rather than Leo had the deed been done;
46859,L,For many deemed he had cause to have repaid
46860,L,"The Child with scathe, and none to give him aid."

46862,LI,LI
46863,LI,"So wildered by such kindness, so immersed"

46866,LI,"So many weary miles had made him steer,"
46867,LI,"His second thoughts confronting with his first,"
46868,LI,"Nor these like those, nor those like these appear."
46869,LI,"He first with hatred, rage, and venom burned;"
46870,LI,With pity and with love then wholly yearned.
46871,LI,
46872,LII,LII
46873,LII,Much muses he by night and much by day;
46874,LII,"-- Nor cares for ought, nor ought desires beside --"
46875,LII,By equal or more courtesy to pay
46876,LII,The mighty debt that him to Leo tied.
46877,LII,"Be his life long or short, or what it may,"
46878,LII,"Albeit to Leo's service all applied,"
46879,LII,"Dies he a thousand deaths, he can do nought,"

46881,LII,
46882,LIII,LIII
46883,LIII,Thither meanwhile had tidings been conveyed
46884,LIII,Of Charles' decree: that who in nuptial tye
46885,LIII,"Would yoke with Bradamant, with trenchant blade"
46886,LIII,Or lance must with the maid his prowess try.
46887,LIII,"These news the Grecian prince so ill appaid,"
46888,LIII,His cheek was seen to blanch with sickly dye;
46889,LIII,"Because, as one that measured well his might,"
46890,LIII,He knew he was no match for her in fight.
46891,LIII,
46892,LIV,LIV
46893,LIV,"Communing with himself, he can supply"
46894,LIV,(He sees) the valour wanting with his wit;
46895,LIV,"And the strange knight with his own ensignry,"
46896,LIV,"Whose name is yet unknown to him, will fit:"
46897,LIV,"Him he against Frank champion, far and nigh,"
46898,LIV,Believes he may for force and daring pit;
46899,LIV,"And if the knight to that emprize agree,"
46900,LIV,Vanquished and taken Bradamant will be.
46901,LIV,
46902,LV,LV
46903,LV,"But two things must he do; must, first, dispose"
46904,LV,That cavalier to undertake the emprize;
46905,LV,"Then send afield the champion, whom he chose,"
46906,LV,"In mode, that none suspect the youth's disguise:"
46907,LV,To him the matter Leo doth disclose;
46908,LV,"And after prays in efficacious wise,"
46909,LV,"That he the combat with the maid will claim,"
46910,LV,Under false colours and in other's name.
46911,LV,
46912,LVI,LVI
46913,LVI,Much weighs the Grecian's eloquence; but more
46914,LVI,Than eloquence with good Rogero weighed
46915,LVI,The mighty obligation which he bore;
46916,LVI,That debt which cannot ever be repaid.
46917,LVI,"So, albeit it appeared a hardship sore"
46918,LVI,"And thing well-nigh impossible, he said,"
46919,LVI,"With blither face than heart, that Leo's will"
46920,LVI,In all that he commands he would fulfil.
46921,LVI,
46922,LVII,LVII
46923,LVII,"Albeit no sooner he the intent exprest,"
46924,LVII,Than with sore grief Rogero's heart was shent;
46925,LVII,"Which, night and day, and ever, doth molest,"
46926,LVII,"Ever afflict him, evermore torment:"
46927,LVII,"And though he sees his death is manifest,"
46928,LVII,Never will he confess he doth repent:
46929,LVII,"Rather than not with Leo's prayer comply,"
46930,LVII,"A thousand deaths, not one, the Child will die."
46931,LVII,
46932,LVIII,LVIII
46933,LVIII,Right sure he is to die; if he forego
46934,LVIII,"The lady, he foregoes his life no less."
46935,LVIII,"His heart will break through his distress and woe,"
46936,LVIII,"Or, breaking not with woe and with distress,"
46937,LVIII,"He will, himself, the bands of life undo,"
46938,LVIII,And of its clay the spirit dispossess.
46939,LVIII,For all things can he better bear than one;
46940,LVIII,Than see that gentle damsel not his own.
46941,LVIII,
46942,LIX,LIX
46943,LIX,To die is he disposed; but how to die
46944,LIX,Cannot as yet the sorrowing lord decide:
46945,LIX,"Sometimes he thinks his prowess to belie,"
46946,LIX,And offer to her sword his naked side:
46947,LIX,For never death can come more happily
46948,LIX,Than if her hand the fatal faulchion guide:
46949,LIX,"Then sees, except he wins the martial maid"
46950,LIX,"For that Greek prince, the debt remains unpaid."
46951,LIX,
46952,LX,LX
46953,LX,"For he with Bradamant, as with a foe,"
46954,LX,"Promised to do, not feign, a fight in mail,"
46955,LX,And not to make of arms a seeming show;
46956,LX,So that his sword should Leo ill avail.
46957,LX,Then by his word will he abide; and though
46958,LX,"His breast now these now other thoughts assail,"
46959,LX,"All from his bosom chased the generous youth,"
46960,LX,Save that which moved him to maintain his truth.
46961,LX,
46962,LXI,LXI
46963,LXI,"With the emperor's licence, armour to prepare,"
46964,LXI,And steeds meanwhile had wrought his youthful son;
46965,LXI,Who with such goodly following as might square
46966,LXI,"With his degree, upon his way was gone:"
46967,LXI,"With him Rogero rides, through Leo's care,"
46968,LXI,"Equipt with horse and arms, that were his own."
46969,LXI,Day after day the squadron pricks; nor tarries
46970,LXI,Until arrived in France; arrived at Paris.
46971,LXI,
46972,LXII,LXII
46973,LXII,Leo will enter not the town; but nigh
46974,LXII,Pitches his broad pavilions on the plain;
46975,LXII,And his arrival by an embassy
46976,LXII,Makes known that day to royal Charlemagne.
46977,LXII,Well pleased is he; and visits testify
46978,LXII,And many gifts the monarch's courteous vein.
46979,LXII,"His journey's cause the Grecian prince displayed,"
46980,LXII,And to dispatch his suit the sovereign prayed:
46981,LXII,
46982,LXIII,LXIII
46983,LXIII,"To send afield the damsel, who denied"
46984,LXIII,Ever to take in wedlock any lord
46985,LXIII,"Weaker than her: for she should be his bride,"
46986,LXIII,Or he would perish by the lady's sword.
46987,LXIII,"Charles undertook for this; and, on her side,"
46988,LXIII,The following day upon the listed sward
46989,LXIII,"Before the walls, in haste, enclosed that night,"
46990,LXIII,"Appeared the martial maid, equipt for fight."
46991,LXIII,
46992,LXIV,LXIV
46993,LXIV,Rogero past the night before the day
46994,LXIV,"Wherein by him the battle should be done,"
46995,LXIV,"Like that which felon spends, condemning to pay"
46996,LXIV,Life's forfeit with the next succeeding sun:
46997,LXIV,He made his choice to combat in the fray
46998,LXIV,All armed; because he would discovery shun:
46999,LXIV,"Nor barded steed he backed, nor lance he shook;"
47000,LXIV,Nor other weapon than his faulchion took.
47001,LXIV,
47002,LXV,LXV
47003,LXV,No lance he took: yet was it not through fear
47004,LXV,Of that which Argalia whilom swayed;
47005,LXV,"Astolpho's next; then hers, that in career"
47006,LXV,Her foemen ever upon earth had laid:
47007,LXV,"Because none weened such force was in the spear,"
47008,LXV,Nor that it was by necromancy made;
47009,LXV,Excepting royal Galaphron alone;
47010,LXV,"Who had it forged, and gave it to his son."
47011,LXV,
47012,LXVI,LXVI
47013,LXVI,"Nay, bold Astolpho, and the lady who"
47014,LXVI,"Afterwards bore it, deemed that not to spell,"
47015,LXVI,"But simply to their proper force, was due"
47016,LXVI,The praise that they in knightly joust excel;
47017,LXVI,"And with whatever spear they fought, those two"
47018,LXVI,Believed that they should have performed as well.
47019,LXVI,What only makes that knight the joust forego
47020,LXVI,Is that he would not his Frontino show.
47021,LXVI,
47022,LXVII,LXVII
47023,LXVII,For easily that steed of generous kind
47024,LXVII,"She might have known, if him she had espied;"
47025,LXVII,"Whom in Montalban, long to her consigned,"
47026,LXVII,The gentle damsel had been wont to ride.
47027,LXVII,"Rogero, that but schemes, but hath in mind"
47028,LXVII,"How he from Brandamant himself shall hide,"
47029,LXVII,Neither Frontino nor yet other thing.
47030,LXVII,"Whereby he may be known, afield will bring."
47031,LXVII,
47032,LXVIII,LXVIII
47033,LXVIII,With a new sword will he the maid await;
47034,LXVIII,For well he knew against the enchanted blade
47035,LXVIII,As soft as paste would prove all mail and plate;
47036,LXVIII,For never any steel its fury stayed;
47037,LXVIII,"And heavily with hammer, to rebate"
47038,LXVIII,"Its edge, as well he on this faulchion layed."
47039,LXVIII,"So armed, Rogero in the lists appeared,"
47040,LXVIII,When the first dawn of day the horizon cheered.
47041,LXVIII,
47042,LXIX,LXIX
47043,LXIX,"To look like Leo, o'er his breast is spread"
47044,LXIX,The surcoat that the prince is wont to wear;
47045,LXIX,And the gold eagle with its double head
47046,LXIX,He blazoned on the crimson shield doth bear;
47047,LXIX,And (what the Child's disguisement well may stead)
47048,LXIX,Of equal size and stature are the pair.
47049,LXIX,In the other's form presents himself the one;
47050,LXIX,That other lets himself be seen of none.
47051,LXIX,
47052,LXX,LXX
47053,LXX,Dordona's martial maid is of a vein
47054,LXX,"Right different from the gentle youth's, who sore"
47055,LXX,"Hammers and blunts the faulchion's tempered grain,"
47056,LXX,Lest it his opposite should cleave or bore.
47057,LXX,"She whets her steel, and into it would fain"
47058,LXX,"Enter, that stripling to the quick to gore:"
47059,LXX,"Yea, would such fury to her strokes impart,"
47060,LXX,That each should go directly to his heart.
47061,LXX,
47062,LXXI,LXXI
47063,LXXI,"As on the start the generous barb in spied,"

47457,CX,For this not vainly in the doubtful fight
47458,CX,Should Constantine's fair son have risked to die;
47459,CX,"Nor Charlemagne for this, our sovereign lord"

47465,CXI,Charles at my daughter's prayer that edict made
47466,CXI,"Which has drawn Leo to the combat here."""
47467,CXI,Orlando and Rinaldo were gainsayed
47468,CXI,So before royal Charles by Clermont's peer;
47469,CXI,"And equal Charlemagne heard either side,"
47470,CXI,But neither would for this nor that decide.
47471,CXI,
47472,CXII,CXII
47473,CXII,As in the southern or the northern breeze

47476,CXII,"Is wroth, the hoarse and hollow breakers roar,"
47477,CXII,"So a loud rumour of this strife, that flees"
47478,CXII,"Through France, and spreads and circles evermore,"
47479,CXII,"Affords such matter to rehearse and hear,"

47486,CXIII,Good Charlemagne to neither party bends;
47487,CXIII,"But wills that cause shall be by justice tried,"
47488,CXIII,And to his parliament the matter sends.
47489,CXIII,"Marphisa, now the bridal was deferred,"
47490,CXIII,"Appeared anew, and other question stirred;"
47491,CXIII,
47492,CXIV,CXIV

47495,CXIV,"Let Leo, if the gentle maid he crave,"
47496,CXIV,His foe in listed fight of life deprive;
47497,CXIV,"And he, that sends the other to his grave,"
47498,CXIV,"Freed from his rival, with the lady wive."""
47499,CXIV,"Forthwith this challenge, as erewhile the rest,"
47500,CXIV,To Leo was declared at Charles' behest.
47501,CXIV,
47502,CXV,CXV
47503,CXV,Leo who if he had the cavalier
47504,CXV,"Of the unicorn, believed he from his foe"
47505,CXV,Was safe; and thought no peril would appear
47506,CXV,Too hard a feat for him; and knew not how
47507,CXV,Thence into solitary woods and drear
47508,CXV,That warrior had been hurried by his woe;
47509,CXV,Him gone for little time and for disport
47510,CXV,"Believed, and took his line in evil sort."
47511,CXV,
47512,CXVI,CXVI
47513,CXVI,This shortly Leo was condemned to rue:
47514,CXVI,"For he, on whom too fondly he relied,"
47515,CXVI,Nor on that day nor on the following two
47516,CXVI,"Appeared, nor news of him were signified;"
47517,CXVI,"And combat with Rogero was, he knew,"
47518,CXVI,"Unsafe, unless that knight was on his side:"
47519,CXVI,"So sent, to eschew the threatened scathe and scorn,"
47520,CXVI,To seek the warrior of the unicorn.
47521,CXVI,
47522,CXVII,CXVII
47523,CXVII,"Through city, and through hamlet, and through town,"
47524,CXVII,"He sends to seek Rogero, far and near:"
47525,CXVII,"And not content with this, himself is gone"
47526,CXVII,"In person, on his steed, to find the peer."
47527,CXVII,But of the missing warrior tidings none
47528,CXVII,Nor he nor any of the Court would hear
47529,CXVII,But for Melissa: I for other verse

47732,XIX,"Remains, let me my course delay no more;"
47733,XIX,"And turning to Melissa, in what way"
47734,XIX,She rescued good Rogero let me say.
47735,XIX,
47736,XX,XX
47737,XX,Much bent was this Melissa (as I know
47738,XX,I many times have said to you whilere)
47739,XX,That Bradamant in wedlock should bestow
47740,XX,Her hand upon the youthful cavalier;
47741,XX,"And so at heart had either's weal and woe,"
47742,XX,That she from hour to hour of them would hear:
47743,XX,"Hence ever on that quest she spirits sent,"
47744,XX,One still returning as the other went.
47745,XX,
47746,XXI,XXI
47747,XXI,"A prey to deep and stubborn grief, reclined"
47748,XXI,Mid gloomy shades Rogero they descried;
47749,XXI,"Firm not to swallow food of any kind,"
47750,XXI,Nor from that purpose to be turned aside;
47751,XXI,And so to die of hunger he designed:
47752,XXI,But weird Melissa speedy aid supplied;
47753,XXI,"Who took a road, from home forth issuing, where"
47754,XXI,She met the Grecian emperor's youthful heir;
47755,XXI,
47756,XXII,XXII
47757,XXII,"Leo that, one by one, dispatched his train"
47758,XXII,"Of followers, far and wide, through every bourn,"
47759,XXII,"And afterwards, in person went in vain,"
47760,XXII,To find the warrior of the unicorn.
47761,XXII,"The wise enchantress, that will sell and rein,"
47762,XXII,"Had on that day equipt a demon, borne"
47763,XXII,"By him, in likeness of a hackney horse,"
47764,XXII,Constantine's son encountered in her course.
47765,XXII,
47766,XXIII,XXIII
47767,XXIII,"""If such as your ingenuous mien"" (she cried"
47768,XXIII,"To Leo) ""is your soul's nobility,"
47769,XXIII,And corresponding with your fair outside
47770,XXIII,"Your inward goodness and your courtesy,"
47771,XXIII,"Some help, some comfort, sir, for one provide"
47772,XXIII,In whom the best of living knights we see;
47773,XXIII,"Who, save ye help and comfort quickly lend,"
47774,XXIII,Is little distant from his latter end.
47775,XXIII,
47776,XXIV,XXIV
47777,XXIV,"""The best of knights will die of all, who don,"
47778,XXIV,"Or e'er donned sword and buckler, the most fair"
47779,XXIV,"And gentle of all warriors that are gone,"
47780,XXIV,"Or who throughout the world yet living are,"
47781,XXIV,"And simply for a courteous deed, if none"
47782,XXIV,Shall comfort to the youthful sufferer bear.
47783,XXIV,"Then come, sir, for the love of Heaven, and try"
47784,XXIV,"If any counsel succour may supply."""
47785,XXIV,
47786,XXV,XXV
47787,XXV,It suddenly came into Leo's mind
47788,XXV,"The knight of whom she parlayed was that same,"
47789,XXV,"Whom throughout all the land he sought to find,"
47790,XXV,"And seeking whom, he now in person came."
47791,XXV,So that obeying her that would persuade
47792,XXV,"Such pious work, he spurred behind the dame;"
47793,XXV,Who thither led (nor tedious was the way)
47794,XXV,Where nigh reduced to death the stripling lay.
47795,XXV,
47796,XXVI,XXVI
47797,XXVI,They found Rogero fasting from all food
47798,XXVI,"For three long days, so broken down; with pain"
47799,XXVI,"The knight could but upon his feet have stood,"
47800,XXVI,"To fall, albeit unpushed, to ground again."
47801,XXVI,"With helm on head, and with his faulchion good"
47802,XXVI,"Begirt, he lay reclined in plate and chain."
47803,XXVI,"A pillow of his buckler had he made,"
47804,XXVI,Where the white unicorn was seen pourtraid.
47805,XXVI,
47806,XXVII,XXVII
47807,XXVII,There thinking what an injury he had done
47808,XXVII,"To his lady love -- how ingrate, how untrue"
47809,XXVII,To her had been -- not simple grief alone
47810,XXVII,"O'erwhelmed him, to such height his fury grew,"
47811,XXVII,He bit his hands and lips; while pouring down
47812,XXVII,"His cheeks, the tears unceasing ran, and through"
47813,XXVII,"The passion that so wrapt his troubled sprite,"
47814,XXVII,Nor Leo nor Melissa heard the knight.
47815,XXVII,
47816,XXVIII,XXVIII
47817,XXVIII,"Nor therefore interrupts he his lament,"
47818,XXVIII,"Nor checks his sighs, nor checks his trickling tears."
47819,XXVIII,"Young Leo halts, to hear his speech intent;"
47820,XXVIII,"Lights from his courser, and towards him steers:"
47821,XXVIII,He knows that of the sorrows which torment
47822,XXVIII,Love is the cause; but yet from nought appears
47823,XXVIII,Who is the person that such grief hath bred;
47824,XXVIII,For by Rogero this remains unsaid.
47825,XXVIII,
47826,XXIX,XXIX
47827,XXIX,"Approaching nearer and yet nearer, now"
47828,XXIX,"He fronts the weeping warrior, face to face,"
47829,XXIX,"Greets with a brother's love, and stooping low,"
47830,XXIX,His neck encircles with a fast embrace.
47831,XXIX,By the lamenting Child I know not how
47832,XXIX,Is liked his sudden presence in that place;
47833,XXIX,Who fears annoy or trouble at his hand;
47834,XXIX,And lest he should his wish for death withstand.
47835,XXIX,
47836,XXX,XXX
47837,XXX,"Him with the sweetest words young Leo plied,"
47838,XXX,"And with the warmest love that he could show,"
47839,XXX,"""Let it not irk thee,"" to the Child he cried,"
47840,XXX,"""To tell the cause from whence thy sorrows flow;"
47841,XXX,"For few such desperate evils man betide,"
47842,XXX,"But that there is deliverance from his woe,"
47843,XXX,So that the cause be known; nor he bereft
47844,XXX,"Of hope should ever be, so life be left."
47845,XXX,
47846,XXXI,XXXI
47847,XXXI,"""Much grieve I thou wouldst hide thyself from me,"
47848,XXXI,That known me for thy faithful friend and true;
47849,XXXI,"Not only now I am so bound to thee,"
47850,XXXI,That I the knot can never more undo;
47851,XXXI,"But even from the beginning, when to be"
47852,XXXI,Thy deadly foeman I had reason due.
47853,XXXI,"Hope then that I will succour thee with pelf,"
47854,XXXI,"With friends, with following, and with life itself."
47855,XXXI,
47856,XXXII,XXXII
47857,XXXII,"""Nor shun to me thy sorrow to explain,"
47858,XXXII,And I beseech thee leave to me to try
47859,XXXII,"If wealth avail to free thee from thy pain,"
47860,XXXII,"Art, cunning, open force, or flattery,"
47861,XXXII,"If my assistance is employed in vain,"
47862,XXXII,The last relief remains to thee to die:
47863,XXXII,But be content awhile this deed to shun
47864,XXXII,"Till all that thou canst do shall first be done."""
47865,XXXII,
47866,XXXIII,XXXIII
47867,XXXIII,He said; and with such forceful prayer appealed;
47868,XXXIII,So gently and benignly soothed his moan;
47869,XXXIII,"That good Rogero could not choose but yield,"
47870,XXXIII,Whose heart was not of iron or of stone;
47871,XXXIII,"Who deemed, unless he now his lips unsealed,"
47872,XXXIII,He should a foul discourteous deed have done.
47873,XXXIII,"He fain would have replied, but made assay"
47874,XXXIII,"Yet twice or thrice, ere words could find their way."
47875,XXXIII,
47876,XXXIV,XXXIV
47877,XXXIV,"""My lord, when known for what I am (and me"
47878,XXXIV,"Now shalt thou know),"" he made at last reply,"
47879,XXXIV,"""I wot thou, like myself, content wilt be,"
47880,XXXIV,"And haply more content, that I should die."
47881,XXXIV,Know me for him so hated once by thee;
47882,XXXIV,Rogero who repaid that hate am I;
47883,XXXIV,And now 'tis many days since with intent
47884,XXXIV,Of putting thee to death from court I went.
47885,XXXIV,
47886,XXXV,XXXV
47887,XXXV,"""Because I would not see my promised bride"
47888,XXXV,Borne off by thee; in that Duke Aymon's love
47889,XXXV,And favour was engaged upon thy side.
47890,XXXV,"But, for man purposes, and God above"
47891,XXXV,"Disposes, thy great courtesy, well tried"
47892,XXXV,"In a sore need, my fixt resolve did move."
47893,XXXV,"Nor only I renounced the hate I bore,"
47894,XXXV,But purposed to be thine for evermore.
47895,XXXV,
47896,XXXVI,XXXVI
47897,XXXVI,"""What time I as Rogero was unknown,"
47898,XXXVI,Thou madest suit I would obtain for thee
47899,XXXVI,The Lady Bradamant; which was all one
47900,XXXVI,As to demand my heart and soul from me.
47901,XXXVI,Whether thy wish I rather than mine own
47902,XXXVI,"Sought to content, thou hast been made to see."
47903,XXXVI,Thine is the lady; her in peace possess;
47904,XXXVI,Far more than mine I prize thy happiness.
47905,XXXVI,
47906,XXXVII,XXXVII
47907,XXXVII,"""Content thee, that deprived of her, as well"
47908,XXXVII,I should myself of worthless life deprive;
47909,XXXVII,For better I without a soul could dwell
47910,XXXVII,Than without Bradamant remain alive.
47911,XXXVII,And never while these veins with life-blood swell
47912,XXXVII,Canst thou with her legitimately wive:
47913,XXXVII,For vows erewhile have been between us said;
47914,XXXVII,"Nor she at once can with two husbands wed."""
47915,XXXVII,
47916,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
47917,XXXVIII,So filled is gentle Leo with amaze
47918,XXXVIII,"When he the stranger for Rogero knows,"
47919,XXXVIII,"With lips and brow unmoved, with stedfast gaze"
47920,XXXVIII,"And rooted feet, he like a statue shows;"
47921,XXXVIII,"Like statue more than man, which votaries raise"
47922,XXXVIII,"In churches, for acquittance of their vows."
47923,XXXVIII,He deems that courtesy of so high a strain
47924,XXXVIII,Was never done nor will be done again;
47925,XXXVIII,
47926,XXXIX,XXXIX
47927,XXXIX,And that he him doth for Rogero know
47928,XXXIX,Not only that goodwill he bore whilere
47929,XXXIX,"Abates not, but augments his kindness so,"
47930,XXXIX,That no less grieves the Grecian cavalier
47931,XXXIX,Than good Rogero for Rogero's woe.
47932,XXXIX,"For this, as well as that he will appear"
47933,XXXIX,Deservedly an emperor's son -- although
47934,XXXIX,In other things outdone -- he will not be
47935,XXXIX,Defeated in the race of courtesy;

47937,XL,XL
47938,XL,"And says, ""That day my host was overthrown,"

47940,XL,"I had thee at despite, if I had known"
47941,XL,"Thou was Rogero, as I know it now,"
47942,XL,"So me thy virtue would have made thine own,"
47943,XL,"As then it made me, knowing not my foe;"
47944,XL,"So hatred from my bosom would have chased,"

47948,XLI,"""That I Rogero hated, ere I knew"
47949,XLI,"Thou was Rogero, will I not deny."

47951,XLI,"The hatred that I bore thee; and had I,"
47952,XLI,"When thee I from thy darksome dungeon drew,"
47953,XLI,"Descried the truth, as this I now descry,"
47954,XLI,"Such treatment shouldst thou then have had, as thou"

47961,XLII,"Not doing so, I should with reason be"
47962,XLII,Deemed most ungrateful amid ingrate men;
47963,XLII,Since thou foregoest thine every good for me!
47964,XLII,"But I to thee restore thy gift, and, more"
47965,XLII,"Glady than I received it, this restore."

47971,XLIII,I think not I my vital thread should shear:
47972,XLIII,Nor would I by thy death be free to woo:
47973,XLIII,That from the hallowed bands of wedlock clear
47974,XLIII,"Wherein the lady hath to thee been tied,"

47982,XLIV,"To me is thy distrust great cause of woe,"
47983,XLIV,That since thou couldst dispose of me no less

47988,XLV,"These words he spake, and more to that intent,"
47989,XLV,Too tedious in these verses to recite;
47990,XLV,Refuting evermore such argument
47991,XLV,As might be used in answer by the knight:
47992,XLV,"Who said, at last, ""I yield, and am content"
47993,XLV,To live; but how can I ever requite

48039,L,Erewhile Rogero for the Bulgars won;
48040,L,"How Leo and his sire were overlaid,"
48041,L,And all their army slaughtered and undone;
48042,L,Wherefore the Bulgars him their king had made;
48043,L,Their royal line excluding from the throne:
48044,L,"Then how Ungiardo took the warrior brave,"
48045,L,And him to cruel Theodora gave.
48046,L,
48047,LI,LI
48048,LI,"He speaks with that of certain news, which say"
48049,LI,"How good Rogero's jailer was found dead,"
48050,LI,The prison broke and prisoner away:
48051,LI,Of what became of him was nothing said.
48052,LI,-- Towards the city by a secret way
48053,LI,(Nor was his visage seen) Rogero sped.
48054,LI,"He, on the following morning, and his friend,"
48055,LI,"Leo, to Charles's court together wend."
48056,LI,
48057,LII,LII
48058,LII,To Charles' court he wends; the bird he bore
48059,LII,Of gold with its two heads -- of crimson hue
48060,LII,"Its field -- and that same vest and ensigns wore,"
48061,LII,As was erewhile devised between the two;
48062,LII,And such as in the listed fight before
48063,LII,His bruised and battered armour was in shew.
48064,LII,So that they quickly knew the cavalier
48065,LII,From him that strove with Bradamant whilere.

48067,LIII,LIII
48068,LIII,"In royal ornaments and costly gown,"

48071,LIII,"Before, behind him, and about him are."
48072,LIII,"He bowed to Charlemagne, who from his throne"
48073,LIII,Had risen to do honour to the pair:
48074,LIII,"Then holding still Rogero by the hand,"

48116,LVII,
48117,LVIII,LVIII
48118,LVIII,"She spake this with such anger and disdain,"
48119,LVIII,"Many surmised amid the assistant crew,"
48120,LVIII,"That, without waiting leave from Charlemagne,"
48121,LVIII,What she had threatened she forthwith would do.
48122,LVIII,No longer Leo deemed it time to feign;
48123,LVIII,And from Rogero's head the helm withdrew;
48124,LVIII,"And to Marphisa, ""For himself to speak,"

48126,LVIII,

48135,LIX,She in the stranger knight Rogero knew;
48136,LIX,
48137,LX,LX
48138,LX,And ran forthwith to clip the cavalier;
48139,LX,Nor could unclasp her arms: with loving show
48140,LX,"Charlemagne, Roland, and Rinaldo, here"
48141,LX,"And there, fix friendly kisses on his brow."
48142,LX,"Nor him Sir Dudon, nor Sir Olivier,"
48143,LX,Nor King Sobrino can caress enow:

48152,LXI,-- Albeit to his good squadron's scathe and woe --
48153,LXI,"Which at Belgrade he witnessed in that fight,"
48154,LXI,So moved him that they overweighed all harms
48155,LXI,Inflicted on him by the warrior's arms.
48156,LXI,
48157,LXII,LXII
48158,LXII,"So that to her Rogero being brought,"
48159,LXII,"Who would all havoc of the youth have made,"

48164,LXII,"Did that high courtesy; which can by none,"
48165,LXII,"That ever were or e'er will be, outdone;"
48166,LXII,
48167,LXIII,LXIII
48168,LXIII,"And he from point to point continuing, said"
48169,LXIII,That which Rogero had for him achieved;
48170,LXIII,"And after, how by sorrow sore bested,"
48171,LXIII,"In that to leave his cherished wife he grieved,"
48172,LXIII,"He had resolved to die, and, almost dead,"
48173,LXIII,Was only by his timely aid relieved;
48174,LXIII,"And this he told so movingly, no eye"

48179,LXIV,"To the obstinate Duke Aymon, not alone"
48180,LXIV,"The stubborn sire of Bradamant he swayed,"
48181,LXIV,And to forego his settled purpose won;
48182,LXIV,But that proud lord in person did persuade
48183,LXIV,"To beg Rogero's pardon, and his son"
48184,LXIV,And son-in-law to be beseech the knight;
48185,LXIV,And thus to him his Bradamant was plight.

48187,LXV,LXV
48188,LXV,"To her, where, of her feeble life in doubt,"
48189,LXV,"She in a secret chamber made lament,"

48193,LXV,"Her heart, by her first sorrow thither sent,"
48194,LXV,"Ebbed at this notice in so full a tide,"
48195,LXV,Well nigh for sudden joy the damsel died.

48213,LXVII,Conceal the dark and envious thoughts they brew.
48214,LXVII,"As the fox waits the motions of the hare,"
48215,LXVII,"They wait their time for vengeance, and forbear."
48216,LXVII,

48251,LXXI,Save Fortune otherwise of him dispose.
48252,LXXI,"When this is heard by that Greek emperor's son,"

48262,LXXII,"None of the virtues, in Rogero spied,"
48263,LXXII,"Moved Bradamant's ambitious mother so,"
48264,LXXII,"Or so to endear her son-in-law availed,"

48682,CXIV,"More than one death would she consent to die,"
48683,CXIV,"If she withal could suffer more than one,"
48684,CXIV,Rather than she in that unhappy strife
48685,CXIV,Would see her cherished consort risk his life.
48686,CXIV,
48687,CXV,CXV
48688,CXV,But prayer availed not on the damsel's part
48689,CXV,To make Rogero leave to her the quest:
48690,CXV,She then with mournful face and beating heart
48691,CXV,Stood by to view that pair to fight addrest.
48692,CXV,"From right and left the peer and paynim start,"
48693,CXV,And at each other run with lance in rest.
48694,CXV,"The spears seem ice, as they in shivers fly."
48695,CXV,"The fragments birds, that mount through middle sky."
48696,CXV,
48697,CXVI,CXVI
48698,CXVI,Rodomont's lance which smote in the career
48699,CXVI,"Upon mid-shield, yet harmed it little; so"
48700,CXVI,"Perfect was famous Hector's iron gear,"
48701,CXVI,"Hardened by Vulcan's hand, and safe from blow."
48702,CXVI,As well against the shield his levelled spear
48703,CXVI,"Rogero guides, and that good buckler -- though"
48704,CXVI,"Well steeled within and out, with bone between,"
48705,CXVI,And nigh a palm in thickness -- pierces clean;
48706,CXVI,
48707,CXVII,CXVII
48708,CXVII,"And -- but his lance resists not that fierce shock,"
48709,CXVII,"And at the first assault its splinters fly,"
48710,CXVII,And bits and fragments of the shivered stock
48711,CXVII,Seem fledged with feathers they ascend so high;
48712,CXVII,"Were his arms hewn from adamantine rock,"
48713,CXVII,The spear would pierce the paynim's panoply;
48714,CXVII,"And end that battle: but it breaks withal,"
48715,CXVII,And on their croups both staggering coursers fall.
48716,CXVII,
48717,CXVIII,CXVIII
48718,CXVIII,With bridle and with spur the martial pair
48719,CXVIII,Raise their proud horses nimbly from the ground;
48720,CXVIII,"And having broke their spears, with faulchions bare"
48721,CXVIII,"Return, to bandy fierce and cruel wound."
48722,CXVIII,"Wheeling with wondrous mastery, here and there,"
48723,CXVIII,"The bold and ready coursers in a round,"
48724,CXVIII,The warriors with their biting swords begin
48725,CXVIII,To try where either's armour is most thin.
48726,CXVIII,
48727,CXIX,CXIX
48728,CXIX,Rodomont had not that hard dragon-hide
48729,CXIX,Which heretofore had cased the warrior's breast;
48730,CXIX,Nor Nimrod's trenchant sword was at his side;
48731,CXIX,Nor the accustomed helm his temples prest.
48732,CXIX,"For on that bridge which spanned the narrow tide,"
48733,CXIX,"A loser to Dordona's lady, vest"
48734,CXIX,And arms suspended from the votive stone
48735,CXIX,"He left; as I, meseems, erewhile have shown."
48736,CXIX,
48737,CXX,CXX
48738,CXX,Clad was the king in other goodly mail;
48739,CXX,Yet not like that first panoply secure:
48740,CXX,"But neither this, nor that, nor harder scale"
48741,CXX,Could Balisarda's deadly dint endure;
48742,CXX,"Against which neither workmanship avail,"
48743,CXX,"Enchantment, temper, nor prime steel and pure."
48744,CXX,"So here so there Rogero plied his sword,"
48745,CXX,He more than once the paynim's armour bored.
48746,CXX,
48747,CXXI,CXXI
48748,CXXI,When Rodomont beholds in that fierce close
48749,CXXI,"His widely crimsoned arms, nor can restrain"
48750,CXXI,The greater portion of those griding blows
48751,CXXI,"From biting to the quick, through plate and chain,"
48752,CXXI,"He with more fury, with more rage o'erflows,"
48753,CXXI,Than in mid winter the tempestrous main
48754,CXXI,"Flings down his shield, and with both hands outright"
48755,CXXI,Lays at Rogero's helm with all his might.
48756,CXXI,
48757,CXXII,CXXII
48758,CXXII,"With that excessive force, wherewith the gin,"
48759,CXXII,"Erected in two barges upon Po,"
48760,CXXII,"And raised by men and wheels, with deafening din"
48761,CXXII,"Descends upon the sharpened piles below,"
48762,CXXII,With all his might he smote the paladin
48763,CXXII,With either hand; was never direr blow:
48764,CXXII,"Him the charmed helmet helped, or -- such its force --"
48765,CXXII,The stroke would have divided man and horse.
48766,CXXII,
48767,CXXIII,CXXIII
48768,CXXIII,"As if about to fall, the youthful lord"
48769,CXXIII,"Twice nodded, opening legs and arms; anew"
48770,CXXIII,"Rodomont smote, in that he would afford"
48771,CXXIII,His foe no time his spirits to renew:
48772,CXXIII,Then threatened other stroke; but that fine sword
48773,CXXIII,"Bore not such hammering, and in shivers flew;"
48774,CXXIII,"And the bold Saracen, bereft of brand"
48775,CXXIII,Was in the combat left with unarmed hand.
48776,CXXIII,
48777,CXXIV,CXXIV
48778,CXXIV,But not for this doth Rodomont refrain:
48779,CXXIV,"He swoops upon the Child, unheeding aught:"
48780,CXXIV,So sore astounded is Rogero's brain;
48781,CXXIV,So wholly overclouded is his thought.
48782,CXXIV,"But him the paynim well awakes again,"
48783,CXXIV,"Whom by the neck he with strong arm has caught,"
48784,CXXIV,"And gripes and grapples with such mighty force,"
48785,CXXIV,"He falls on earth, pulled headlong from his horse."
48786,CXXIV,
48787,CXXV,CXXV
48788,CXXV,"Yet leaps from earth as nimbly, moved by spleen"
48789,CXXV,Far less than shame; for on his gentle bride
48790,CXXV,"He turned his eyes, and that fair face serene"
48791,CXXV,Now troubled the disdainful warrior spied.
48792,CXXV,She in sore doubt her champion's fall had seen;
48793,CXXV,And well nigh at that sight the lady died.
48794,CXXV,"Rogero, quickly to revenge the affront,"
48795,CXXV,Clutches his sword and faces Rodomont.
48796,CXXV,
48797,CXXVI,CXXVI
48798,CXXVI,"He at Rogero rode, who that rude shock"
48799,CXXVI,"Shunned warily, retiring from his ground,"
48800,CXXVI,"And, as he past, the paynim's bridle took"
48801,CXXVI,"With his left had, and turned his courser round;"
48802,CXXVI,"While with his right he at his rider struck,"
48803,CXXVI,"Whom he in belly, flank and breast would wound;"
48804,CXXVI,"And twice sore anguish felt the monarch, gored"
48805,CXXVI,"In flank and thigh, by good Rogero's sword."
48806,CXXVI,
48807,CXXVII,CXXVII
48808,CXXVII,"Rodomont, grasping still in that close fight"
48809,CXXVII,"The hilt and pommel of his broken blade,"
48810,CXXVII,"Layed at Rogero's helmet with such might,"
48811,CXXVII,That him another stroke might have dismaid:
48812,CXXVII,"But good Rogero, who should win of right,"
48813,CXXVII,"Seizing his arm, the king so rudely swayed,"
48814,CXXVII,"Bringing his left his better hand to speed,"
48815,CXXVII,That he pulled down the paynim from his steed.
48816,CXXVII,
48817,CXXVIII,CXXVIII
48818,CXXVIII,"Through force or skill, so fell the Moorish lord,"
48819,CXXVIII,"He stood his match, I rather ought to say"
48820,CXXVIII,Fell on his feet; because Rogero's sword
48821,CXXVIII,"Gave him, 'twas deemed, advantage in the fray."
48822,CXXVIII,"Rogero stands aloof, with wary ward"
48823,CXXVIII,As fain to keep the paynim king at bay.
48824,CXXVIII,For the wise champion will not let a wight
48825,CXXVIII,So talk and bulky close with him in fight;
48826,CXXVIII,
48827,CXXIX,CXXIX
48828,CXXIX,"Rogero flank and thigh dyed red beheld,"
48829,CXXIX,And other wounds; and hoped he would have failed
48830,CXXIX,"By little and by little, as it welled;"
48831,CXXIX,So that he finally should have prevailed.
48832,CXXIX,His hilt and pommel in his fist yet held
48833,CXXIX,"The paynim, which with all his might he scaled"
48834,CXXIX,"At young Rogero; whom he smote so sore,"
48835,CXXIX,The stripling never was so stunned before.
48836,CXXIX,
48837,CXXX,CXXX
48838,CXXX,In the helmet-cheek and shoulder-bone below
48839,CXXX,"The Child was smit, and left so sore astound,"
48840,CXXX,"He, tripping still and staggering to and fro,"
48841,CXXX,Scarce kept himself from falling to the ground.
48842,CXXX,Rodomont fain would close upon his foe;
48843,CXXX,"But his foot fails him, weakened by the wound,"
48844,CXXX,Which pierced his thigh: he overtasked his might;
48845,CXXX,And on his kneepan fell the paynim knight.
48846,CXXX,
48847,CXXXI,CXXXI
48848,CXXXI,"Rogero lost no time, and with fierce blows"
48849,CXXXI,Smote him in face and bosom with his brand;
48850,CXXXI,"Hammered, and held the Saracen so close,"
48851,CXXXI,To ground he bore that champion with his hand.
48852,CXXXI,"But he so stirred himself, again he rose:"
48853,CXXXI,"He gripes Rogero so, fast locked they stand."
48854,CXXXI,"Seconding their huge vigour by address,"
48855,CXXXI,"They circle one another, shake, and press."
48856,CXXXI,
48857,CXXXII,CXXXII
48858,CXXXII,His wounded thigh and gaping flank had sore
48859,CXXXII,Weakened the vigour of the Moorish king:
48860,CXXXII,Rogero had address; had mickle lore;
48861,CXXXII,Was greatly practised in the wrestlers' ring:
48862,CXXXII,"He marked his vantage, nor from strife forbore;"
48863,CXXXII,"And, where he saw the blood most freely spring,"
48864,CXXXII,"And where most wounded was the warrior, prest"
48865,CXXXII,"The paynim with his feet, his arms, and breast."
48866,CXXXII,
48867,CXXXIII,CXXXIII
48868,CXXXIII,"Rodomont filled with spite and rage, his foe"
48869,CXXXIII,"Takes by the neck and shoulders, and now bends"
48870,CXXXIII,"Towards him, and now pushes from him; now"
48871,CXXXIII,"Raises from earth, and on his chest suspends;"
48872,CXXXIII,Whirls here and there and grapples; and to throw
48873,CXXXIII,The stripling sorely in that strife contends.
48874,CXXXIII,"Collected in himself, Rogero wrought,"
48875,CXXXIII,To keep his vantage taxing strength and thought.
48876,CXXXIII,
48877,CXXXIV,CXXXIV
48878,CXXXIV,"So shifting oft his hold, about the Moor"
48879,CXXXIV,His arms the good and bold Rogero wound;
48880,CXXXIV,"Against his left flank shoved his breast, and sore"
48881,CXXXIV,Strained him with all his strength engirdled round.
48882,CXXXIV,At once he past his better leg before
48883,CXXXIV,"Rodomont's knees and pushed, and from the ground"
48884,CXXXIV,Uplifted high in air the Moorish lord;
48885,CXXXIV,Then hurled him down head foremost on the sward.
48886,CXXXIV,
48887,CXXXV,CXXXV
48888,CXXXV,Such was the shock wherewith King Rodomont
48889,CXXXV,"With battered head and spine the champion smote,"
48890,CXXXV,"That, issuing from his wounds as from a font,"
48891,CXXXV,Streams of red blood the crimsoned herbage float.
48892,CXXXV,"Rogero, holding Fortune by the front,"
48893,CXXXV,"Lest he should rise, with one hand griped his throat,"
48894,CXXXV,With one a dagger at his eyes addrest;
48895,CXXXV,And with his knees the paynim's belly prest.
48896,CXXXV,
48897,CXXVI,CXXVI
48898,CXXVI,As sometimes where they work the golden vein
48899,CXXVI,"Within Pannonian or Iberian cave,"
48900,CXXVI,In unexpected ruin whelm the train
48901,CXXVI,"By impious avarice there condemned to slave,"
48902,CXXVI,"So with the load they lie opprest, with pain"
48903,CXXVI,A passage can their prisoned spirit have:
48904,CXXVI,"No less opprest the doughty paynim lay,"
48905,CXXVI,Pinned to the ground in that disastrous fray.
48906,CXXVI,
48907,CXXXVII,CXXXVII
48908,CXXXVII,Rogero at his vizor doth present
48909,CXXXVII,"His naked poniard's point, with threatening cry,"
48910,CXXXVII,"That he will slay him, save he yields, content"
48911,CXXXVII,"To let him live, if he for grace apply."
48912,CXXXVII,"But Rodomont, who rather than be shent"
48913,CXXXVII,"For the least deed of shame, preferred to die,"
48914,CXXXVII,"Writhed, struggled, and with all his vigour tried"
48915,CXXXVII,"To pull Rogero down, and nought replied."
48916,CXXXVII,
48917,CXXXVIII,CXXXVIII
48918,CXXXVIII,"As mastiff that below the deer-hound lies,"
48919,CXXXVIII,"Fixed by the gullet fast, with holding bite,"
48920,CXXXVIII,"Sorely bestirs himself and vainly tries,"
48921,CXXXVIII,"With lips besmeared with foam and eyes alight,"
48922,CXXXVIII,"And cannot from beneath the conqueror rise,"
48923,CXXXVIII,"Who foils his foe by force, and not despite;"
48924,CXXXVIII,So vainly strives the monarch of Argier
48925,CXXXVIII,To rise from underneath the cavalier.
48926,CXXXVIII,
48927,CXXXIX,CXXXIX
48928,CXXXIX,"Yet Rodomont so twists and strives, he gains"
48929,CXXXIX,The freedom of his better arm anew;
48930,CXXXIX,"And with the right hand, which his poniard strains,"
48931,CXXXIX,"For he had drawn his deadly dagger too,"
48932,CXXXIX,Would wound Rogero underneath the reins:
48933,CXXXIX,But now the wary youth the error knew
48934,CXXXIX,"Through which he might have died, by his delay"
48935,CXXXIX,That impious Saracen forthwith to slay;
48936,CXXXIX,
48937,CXL,CXL
48938,CXL,"And smiting twice or thrice his horrid front,"
48939,CXL,Raising as high as he could raise in air
48940,CXL,"His dagger, buried it in Rodomont;"
48941,CXL,And freed himself withal from further care.
48942,CXL,"Loosed from the more than icy corse, to font"
48943,CXL,"Of fetid Acheron, and hell's foul repair,"
48944,CXL,"The indignant spirit fled, blaspheming loud;"
48945,CXL,Erewhile on earth so haughty and so proud.
48946,CXL,
