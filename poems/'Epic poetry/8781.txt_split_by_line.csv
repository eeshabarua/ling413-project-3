44,CANTO V,
45,CANTO V,FROM the first circle I descended thus
46,CANTO V,"Down to the second, which, a lesser space"
47,CANTO V,"Embracing, so much more of grief contains"
48,CANTO V,"Provoking bitter moans.  There, Minos stands"
49,CANTO V,"Grinning with ghastly feature: he, of all"
50,CANTO V,"Who enter, strict examining the crimes,"
51,CANTO V,
52,CANTO V,"Gives sentence, and dismisses them beneath,"
53,CANTO V,According as he foldeth him around:
54,CANTO V,"For when before him comes th' ill fated soul,"
55,CANTO V,It all confesses; and that judge severe
56,CANTO V,"Of sins, considering what place in hell"
57,CANTO V,"Suits the transgression, with his tail so oft"
58,CANTO V,"Himself encircles, as degrees beneath"
59,CANTO V,He dooms it to descend.  Before him stand
60,CANTO V,Always a num'rous throng; and in his turn
61,CANTO V,"Each one to judgment passing, speaks, and hears"
62,CANTO V,"His fate, thence downward to his dwelling hurl'd."
63,CANTO V,
64,CANTO V,"""O thou! who to this residence of woe"
65,CANTO V,"Approachest?""  when he saw me coming, cried"
66,CANTO V,"Minos, relinquishing his dread employ,"
67,CANTO V,"""Look how thou enter here; beware in whom"
68,CANTO V,Thou place thy trust; let not the entrance broad
69,CANTO V,"Deceive thee to thy harm.""  To him my guide:"
70,CANTO V,"""Wherefore exclaimest?  Hinder not his way"
71,CANTO V,By destiny appointed; so 'tis will'd
72,CANTO V,"Where will and power are one.  Ask thou no more."""
73,CANTO V,
74,CANTO V,Now 'gin the rueful wailings to be heard.
75,CANTO V,Now am I come where many a plaining voice
76,CANTO V,Smites on mine ear.  Into a place I came
77,CANTO V,Where light was silent all.  Bellowing there groan'd
78,CANTO V,A noise as of a sea in tempest torn
79,CANTO V,By warring winds.  The stormy blast of hell
80,CANTO V,With restless fury drives the spirits on
81,CANTO V,Whirl'd round and dash'd amain with sore annoy.
82,CANTO V,
83,CANTO V,"When they arrive before the ruinous sweep,"
84,CANTO V,"There shrieks are heard, there lamentations, moans,"
85,CANTO V,And blasphemies 'gainst the good Power in heaven.
86,CANTO V,
87,CANTO V,I understood that to this torment sad
88,CANTO V,"The carnal sinners are condemn'd, in whom"
89,CANTO V,Reason by lust is sway'd.  As in large troops
90,CANTO V,"And multitudinous, when winter reigns,"
91,CANTO V,The starlings on their wings are borne abroad;
92,CANTO V,So bears the tyrannous gust those evil souls.
93,CANTO V,"On this side and on that, above, below,"
94,CANTO V,It drives them: hope of rest to solace them
95,CANTO V,"Is none, nor e'en of milder pang.  As cranes,"
96,CANTO V,"Chanting their dol'rous notes, traverse the sky,"
97,CANTO V,Stretch'd out in long array: so I beheld
98,CANTO V,"Spirits, who came loud wailing, hurried on"
99,CANTO V,"By their dire doom.  Then I: ""Instructor! who"
100,CANTO V,"Are these, by the black air so scourg'd?""--""The first"
101,CANTO V,"'Mong those, of whom thou question'st,"" he replied,"
102,CANTO V,"""O'er many tongues was empress.  She in vice"
103,CANTO V,"Of luxury was so shameless, that she made"
104,CANTO V,"Liking be lawful by promulg'd decree,"
105,CANTO V,To clear the blame she had herself incurr'd.
106,CANTO V,"This is Semiramis, of whom 'tis writ,"
107,CANTO V,That she succeeded Ninus her espous'd;
108,CANTO V,"And held the land, which now the Soldan rules."
109,CANTO V,"The next in amorous fury slew herself,"
110,CANTO V,And to Sicheus' ashes broke her faith:
111,CANTO V,"Then follows Cleopatra, lustful queen."""
112,CANTO V,
113,CANTO V,"There mark'd I Helen, for whose sake so long"
114,CANTO V,The time was fraught with evil; there the great
115,CANTO V,"Achilles, who with love fought to the end."
116,CANTO V,"Paris I saw, and Tristan; and beside"
117,CANTO V,"A thousand more he show'd me, and by name"
118,CANTO V,"Pointed them out, whom love bereav'd of life."
119,CANTO V,
120,CANTO V,When I had heard my sage instructor name
121,CANTO V,"Those dames and knights of antique days, o'erpower'd"
122,CANTO V,"By pity, well-nigh in amaze my mind"
123,CANTO V,"Was lost; and I began: ""Bard! willingly"
124,CANTO V,"I would address those two together coming,"
125,CANTO V,"Which seem so light before the wind.""  He thus:"
126,CANTO V,"""Note thou, when nearer they to us approach."""
127,CANTO V,
128,CANTO V,"""Then by that love which carries them along,"
129,CANTO V,"Entreat; and they will come.""  Soon as the wind"
130,CANTO V,"Sway'd them toward us, I thus fram'd my speech:"
131,CANTO V,"""O wearied spirits! come, and hold discourse"
132,CANTO V,"With us, if by none else restrain'd.""  As doves"
133,CANTO V,"By fond desire invited, on wide wings"
134,CANTO V,"And firm, to their sweet nest returning home,"
135,CANTO V,"Cleave the air, wafted by their will along;"
136,CANTO V,"Thus issu'd from that troop, where Dido ranks,"
137,CANTO V,They through the ill air speeding; with such force
138,CANTO V,My cry prevail'd by strong affection urg'd.
139,CANTO V,
140,CANTO V,"""O gracious creature and benign! who go'st"
141,CANTO V,"Visiting, through this element obscure,"
142,CANTO V,"Us, who the world with bloody stain imbru'd;"
143,CANTO V,"If for a friend the King of all we own'd,"
144,CANTO V,"Our pray'r to him should for thy peace arise,"
145,CANTO V,Since thou hast pity on our evil plight.
146,CANTO V,()f whatsoe'er to hear or to discourse
147,CANTO V,"It pleases thee, that will we hear, of that"
148,CANTO V,"Freely with thee discourse, while e'er the wind,"
149,CANTO V,"As now, is mute.  The land, that gave me birth,"
150,CANTO V,"Is situate on the coast, where Po descends"
151,CANTO V,To rest in ocean with his sequent streams.
152,CANTO V,
153,CANTO V,"""Love, that in gentle heart is quickly learnt,"
154,CANTO V,"Entangled him by that fair form, from me"
155,CANTO V,"Ta'en in such cruel sort, as grieves me still:"
156,CANTO V,"Love, that denial takes from none belov'd,"
157,CANTO V,"Caught me with pleasing him so passing well,"
158,CANTO V,"That, as thou see'st, he yet deserts me not."
159,CANTO V,
160,CANTO V,"""Love brought us to one death: Caina waits"
161,CANTO V,"The soul, who spilt our life.""  Such were their words;"
162,CANTO V,"At hearing which downward I bent my looks,"
163,CANTO V,"And held them there so long, that the bard cried:"
164,CANTO V,"""What art thou pond'ring?""  I in answer thus:"
165,CANTO V,"""Alas! by what sweet thoughts, what fond desire"
166,CANTO V,"Must they at length to that ill pass have reach'd!"""
167,CANTO V,
168,CANTO V,"Then turning, I to them my speech address'd."
169,CANTO V,"And thus began: ""Francesca! your sad fate"
170,CANTO V,Even to tears my grief and pity moves.
171,CANTO V,"But tell me; in the time of your sweet sighs,"
172,CANTO V,"By what, and how love granted, that ye knew"
173,CANTO V,"Your yet uncertain wishes?""  She replied:"
174,CANTO V,"""No greater grief than to remember days"
175,CANTO V,"Of joy, when mis'ry is at hand!  That kens"
176,CANTO V,Thy learn'd instructor.  Yet so eagerly
177,CANTO V,"If thou art bent to know the primal root,"
178,CANTO V,"From whence our love gat being, I will do,"
179,CANTO V,"As one, who weeps and tells his tale.  One day"
180,CANTO V,"For our delight we read of Lancelot,"
181,CANTO V,"How him love thrall'd.  Alone we were, and no"
182,CANTO V,Suspicion near us.  Ofttimes by that reading
183,CANTO V,"Our eyes were drawn together, and the hue"
184,CANTO V,Fled from our alter'd cheek.  But at one point
185,CANTO V,"Alone we fell.  When of that smile we read,"
186,CANTO V,"The wished smile, rapturously kiss'd"
187,CANTO V,"By one so deep in love, then he, who ne'er"
188,CANTO V,"From me shall separate, at once my lips"
189,CANTO V,All trembling kiss'd.  The book and writer both
190,CANTO V,Were love's purveyors.  In its leaves that day
191,CANTO V,"We read no more.""  While thus one spirit spake,"
192,CANTO V,"The other wail'd so sorely, that heartstruck"
193,CANTO V,"I through compassion fainting, seem'd not far"
194,CANTO V,"From death, and like a corpse fell to the ground."
195,CANTO V,
196,CANTO VI,CANTO VI
197,CANTO VI,
198,CANTO VI,"MY sense reviving, that erewhile had droop'd"
199,CANTO VI,"With pity for the kindred shades, whence grief"
200,CANTO VI,"O'ercame me wholly, straight around I see"
201,CANTO VI,"New torments, new tormented souls, which way"
202,CANTO VI,"Soe'er I move, or turn, or bend my sight."
203,CANTO VI,"In the third circle I arrive, of show'rs"
204,CANTO VI,"Ceaseless, accursed, heavy, and cold, unchang'd"
205,CANTO VI,"For ever, both in kind and in degree."
206,CANTO VI,"Large hail, discolour'd water, sleety flaw"
207,CANTO VI,Through the dun midnight air stream'd down amain:
208,CANTO VI,Stank all the land whereon that tempest fell.
209,CANTO VI,
210,CANTO VI,"Cerberus, cruel monster, fierce and strange,"
211,CANTO VI,Through his wide threefold throat barks as a dog
212,CANTO VI,Over the multitude immers'd beneath.
213,CANTO VI,"His eyes glare crimson, black his unctuous beard,"
214,CANTO VI,"His belly large, and claw'd the hands, with which"
215,CANTO VI,"He tears the spirits, flays them, and their limbs"
216,CANTO VI,"Piecemeal disparts.  Howling there spread, as curs,"
217,CANTO VI,"Under the rainy deluge, with one side"
218,CANTO VI,"The other screening, oft they roll them round,"
219,CANTO VI,"A wretched, godless crew.  When that great worm"
220,CANTO VI,"Descried us, savage Cerberus, he op'd"
221,CANTO VI,"His jaws, and the fangs show'd us; not a limb"
222,CANTO VI,"Of him but trembled.  Then my guide, his palms"
223,CANTO VI,"Expanding on the ground, thence filled with earth"
224,CANTO VI,"Rais'd them, and cast it in his ravenous maw."
225,CANTO VI,
226,CANTO VI,"E'en as a dog, that yelling bays for food"
227,CANTO VI,"His keeper, when the morsel comes, lets fall"
228,CANTO VI,"His fury, bent alone with eager haste"
229,CANTO VI,To swallow it; so dropp'd the loathsome cheeks
230,CANTO VI,"Of demon Cerberus, who thund'ring stuns"
231,CANTO VI,"The spirits, that they for deafness wish in vain."
232,CANTO VI,
233,CANTO VI,"We, o'er the shades thrown prostrate by the brunt"
234,CANTO VI,"Of the heavy tempest passing, set our feet"
235,CANTO VI,"Upon their emptiness, that substance seem'd."
236,CANTO VI,
237,CANTO VI,They all along the earth extended lay
238,CANTO VI,"Save one, that sudden rais'd himself to sit,"
239,CANTO VI,"Soon as that way he saw us pass.  ""O thou!"""
240,CANTO VI,"He cried, ""who through the infernal shades art led,"
241,CANTO VI,"Own, if again thou know'st me.  Thou wast fram'd"
242,CANTO VI,"Or ere my frame was broken.""  I replied:"
243,CANTO VI,"""The anguish thou endur'st perchance so takes"
244,CANTO VI,"Thy form from my remembrance, that it seems"
245,CANTO VI,As if I saw thee never.  But inform
246,CANTO VI,"Me who thou art, that in a place so sad"
247,CANTO VI,"Art set, and in such torment, that although"
248,CANTO VI,"Other be greater, more disgustful none"
249,CANTO VI,"Can be imagin'd.""  He in answer thus:"
250,CANTO VI,
251,CANTO VI,"""Thy city heap'd with envy to the brim,"
252,CANTO VI,"Ay that the measure overflows its bounds,"
253,CANTO VI,Held me in brighter days.  Ye citizens
254,CANTO VI,Were wont to name me Ciacco.  For the sin
255,CANTO VI,"Of glutt'ny, damned vice, beneath this rain,"
256,CANTO VI,"E'en as thou see'st, I with fatigue am worn;"
257,CANTO VI,Nor I sole spirit in this woe: all these
258,CANTO VI,"Have by like crime incurr'd like punishment."""
259,CANTO VI,
260,CANTO VI,"No more he said, and I my speech resum'd:"
261,CANTO VI,"""Ciacco! thy dire affliction grieves me much,"
262,CANTO VI,"Even to tears.  But tell me, if thou know'st,"
263,CANTO VI,What shall at length befall the citizens
264,CANTO VI,Of the divided city; whether any just one
265,CANTO VI,"Inhabit there: and tell me of the cause,"
266,CANTO VI,"Whence jarring discord hath assail'd it thus?"""
267,CANTO VI,
268,CANTO VI,"He then: ""After long striving they will come"
269,CANTO VI,To blood; and the wild party from the woods
270,CANTO VI,Will chase the other with much injury forth.
271,CANTO VI,"Then it behoves, that this must fall, within"
272,CANTO VI,Three solar circles; and the other rise
273,CANTO VI,"By borrow'd force of one, who under shore"
274,CANTO VI,Now rests.  It shall a long space hold aloof
275,CANTO VI,"Its forehead, keeping under heavy weight"
276,CANTO VI,"The other oppress'd, indignant at the load,"
277,CANTO VI,"And grieving sore.  The just are two in number,"
278,CANTO VI,"But they neglected.  Av'rice, envy, pride,"
279,CANTO VI,"Three fatal sparks, have set the hearts of all"
280,CANTO VI,"On fire.""  Here ceas'd the lamentable sound;"
281,CANTO VI,"And I continu'd thus: ""Still would I learn"
282,CANTO VI,"More from thee, farther parley still entreat."
283,CANTO VI,"Of Farinata and Tegghiaio say,"
284,CANTO VI,"They who so well deserv'd, of Giacopo,"
285,CANTO VI,"Arrigo, Mosca, and the rest, who bent"
286,CANTO VI,Their minds on working good.  Oh! tell me where
287,CANTO VI,"They bide, and to their knowledge let me come."
288,CANTO VI,"For I am press'd with keen desire to hear,"
289,CANTO VI,If heaven's sweet cup or poisonous drug of hell
290,CANTO VI,"Be to their lip assign'd.""   He answer'd straight:"
291,CANTO VI,"""These are yet blacker spirits.  Various crimes"
292,CANTO VI,Have sunk them deeper in the dark abyss.
293,CANTO VI,"If thou so far descendest, thou mayst see them."
294,CANTO VI,"But to the pleasant world when thou return'st,"
295,CANTO VI,"Of me make mention, I entreat thee, there."
296,CANTO VI,"No more I tell thee, answer thee no more."""
297,CANTO VI,
298,CANTO VI,"This said, his fixed eyes he turn'd askance,"
299,CANTO VI,"A little ey'd me, then bent down his head,"
300,CANTO VI,And 'midst his blind companions with it fell.
301,CANTO VI,
302,CANTO VI,"When thus my guide: ""No more his bed he leaves,"
303,CANTO VI,Ere the last angel-trumpet blow.  The Power
304,CANTO VI,"Adverse to these shall then in glory come,"
305,CANTO VI,"Each one forthwith to his sad tomb repair,"
306,CANTO VI,"Resume his fleshly vesture and his form,"
307,CANTO VI,And hear the eternal doom re-echoing rend
308,CANTO VI,"The vault.""  So pass'd we through that mixture foul"
309,CANTO VI,"Of spirits and rain, with tardy steps; meanwhile"
310,CANTO VI,"Touching, though slightly, on the life to come."
311,CANTO VI,"For thus I question'd: ""Shall these tortures, Sir!"
312,CANTO VI,"When the great sentence passes, be increas'd,"
313,CANTO VI,"Or mitigated, or as now severe?"""
314,CANTO VI,
315,CANTO VI,"He then: ""Consult thy knowledge; that decides"
316,CANTO VI,"That as each thing to more perfection grows,"
317,CANTO VI,It feels more sensibly both good and pain.
318,CANTO VI,Though ne'er to true perfection may arrive
319,CANTO VI,"This race accurs'd, yet nearer then than now"
320,CANTO VI,"They shall approach it.""  Compassing that path"
321,CANTO VI,"Circuitous we journeyed, and discourse"
322,CANTO VI,Much more than I relate between us pass'd:
323,CANTO VI,"Till at the point, where the steps led below,"
324,CANTO VI,"Arriv'd, there Plutus, the great foe, we found."
