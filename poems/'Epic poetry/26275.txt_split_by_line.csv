71,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
72,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
73,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,The Odyssey starts by organizing itself; it maps out its own structure
74,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,in what may be called a General Introduction. Herein lies a significant
75,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"difference between it and the Iliad, which has simply an Invocation to"
76,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"the Muse, and then leaps into the thick of the action. The Iliad,"
77,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"accordingly, does not formulate its own organization, which fact has"
78,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,been one cause of the frequent assaults upon its unity. Still the
79,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"architectonic principle is powerful in the Iliad, though more"
80,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"instinctive, and far less explicit than in the Odyssey. It is"
81,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"reasonable to suppose, therefore, that the poet has reached a"
82,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,profounder consciousness of his art in his later poem; he has come to a
83,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"knowledge of his constructive principle, and he takes the trouble to"
84,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"unfold the same at the beginning. To be sure, certain critics have"
85,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,assailed just this structural fact as not Homeric; without good
86,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"grounds, in our judgment."
87,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
88,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"The First Book, accordingly, opens with an Introduction which belongs"
89,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"to the entire poem, and which embraces 95 lines of the original text."
90,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"This portion we shall look at separately in some detail, as it throws a"
91,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"number of gleams forward over the whole action, and, as before said,"
92,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"suggests the poetic organism. It has three divisions, the Invocation,"
93,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"the Statement of the Obstacles to the return of the Hero, and the"
94,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"Assembly of the Gods, who are represented as organizing the poem from"
95,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"Olympus. The Divine thus hovers over the poem from the first, starting"
96,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"with one grand, all-embracing providential act, which, however, is"
97,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"supplemented by many special interventions of deities, great and small."
98,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
99,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"_The Invocation._ The first line speaks of the man, Ulysses, and"
100,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"designates his main attribute by a word, which may be translated"
101,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"_versatile_ or _resourceful_, though some grammarians construe it"
102,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,otherwise. Thus we are told at the start of the chief intellectual
103,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"trait of the Hero, who ""wandered much,"" and who, therefore, had many"
104,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,opportunities to exercise his gift. In the second line our attention is
105,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"called to the real starting point of the poem, the taking of Troy,"
106,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"which is the background of the action of the Odyssey, and the great"
107,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"opening event of the Greek world, as here revealed. For this event was"
108,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,the mighty shake which roused the Hellenic people to a consciousness of
109,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,their destiny; they show in it all the germs of their coming greatness.
110,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,Often such a concussion is required to waken a nation to its full
111,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,energy and send it on its future career.
112,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
113,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"Note that Ulysses is here stated to be the taker of Troy, and this view"
114,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,is implied throughout the Odyssey. Note Achilles is the final Greek
115,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"hero; he perished without capturing the city, and in his hands alone"
116,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,the Greek cause would have been lost. The intellectual hero had to come
117,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,forward ere the hostile town could be taken and Helen restored. Herein
118,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"the Odyssey does not contradict the Iliad, but is clearly an advance"
119,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,beyond it.
120,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
121,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,But Troy is destroyed and now the second grand question of the Greeks
122,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,arises: How shall we get back! Only one half of the cycle is completed
123,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,by the conquest of the hostile city; the second half is the
124,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"restoration. For this disjunction from Hellenic life, brought about by"
125,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"war, is not only physical but has become spiritual. The theme,"
126,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"therefore, deals with the wise man, who, through his intelligence, was"
127,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"able to take Troy, but who has now another and greater problem--the"
128,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,return out of the grand estrangement caused by the Trojan expedition.
129,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"Spiritual restoration is the key-note of this _Odyssey_, as it is that"
130,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,of all the great Books of Literature.
131,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
132,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,Here at the start we note two things coupled together which hint the
133,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"nature of the whole poem: ""He saw the cities of many men and knew their"
134,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"mind."" Not alone the outer habitations of people Ulysses beheld, but"
135,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"also their inner essence, their consciousness. This last faculty indeed"
136,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,is the very vision of the sage; he looks through the external sensuous
137,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"appearances of men into their character, into their very soul. The poem"
138,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"will describe many incidents, wanderings, tempests, calamities; but in"
139,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,them the poetic glance is to behold a great spiritual experience. The
140,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"reader of the _Odyssey_ must himself be a Ulysses, to a degree, and not"
141,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"only ""see the cities of many men,"" but also he must ""know their mind."""
142,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"Then he, too, is heroic in his reading of this book."
143,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
144,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"But not merely knowledge the Hero is to acquire, though this be much;"
145,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"the counterpart to knowledge must also be his, namely, suffering. ""Many"
146,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"things he suffered on the sea in his heart;"" alas! that too belongs to"
147,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"the great experience. In addition to his title of wise man, he will"
148,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,also be called the much-enduring man. Sorrow is his lot and great
149,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"tribulation; the mighty sea will rise up in wrath and swallow all,"
150,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"except that which is mightier, namely his heroic heart. Knowledge and"
151,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,suffering--are they not the two poles of the universal character? At
152,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,any rate the old poet has mated them as counterparts in his hero; the
153,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"thirst to know drives the latter to reach beyond, and then falls the"
154,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,avenging blow of powers unseen.
155,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
156,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"Furthermore, there is a third trait which is still higher, also"
157,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,mentioned here: he sought to save not only himself but also his
158,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"companions. That wisdom of his was employed, and that suffering of his"
159,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"was endured, not for his own good merely, but for the good of others."
160,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,He must think and suffer for his companions; a suggestion of
161,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"vicariousness lies therein, a hint of self-offering, which has not yet"
162,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,flowered but is certainly budding far back in old Hellas. He must do
163,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"for others what he does for himself, if he be truly the universal man,"
164,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"that is, if he be Hero. For is not the universal man all men--both"
165,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"himself and others in essence? So Ulysses tries to save his companions,"
166,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,quite as much he tries to save himself.
167,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
168,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"But he did not do it, he could not do it; herein lies his limitation"
169,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"and theirs also, in fact, the limitation of the entire Greek world."
170,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"What did these companions do? ""They perished by their own folly;"" they"
171,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"would not obey the counsel of their wise man; they rejected their Hero,"
172,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"who could not, therefore, rescue them. A greater wisdom and a deeper"
173,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"suffering than that of Ulysses will be required for their salvation,"
174,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"whereof the time has not yet come. He would bring them home, but ""they"
175,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"ate of the oxen of the sun;"" they destroyed the attribute of light in"
176,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,some way and perished. The fact is certainly far-reaching in its
177,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"suggestion; a deep glance it throws into that old heathen world, whose"
178,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,greatest poet in the most unconscious manner hints here the tragic
179,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"limitation of his people and his epoch. It is a hint of which we,"
180,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,looking back through more than twenty-five centuries can see the full
181,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"meaning, as that meaning has unfolded itself in the ages. Time is also"
182,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"a commentator on Homer and has written down, in that alphabet of his,"
183,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"called events, the true interpretation of the old poet. Still the"
184,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,letters of Time's alphabet have also to be learned and require not only
185,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,eyesight but also insight.
186,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
187,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,The Invocation puts all its stress upon Ulysses and his attempt to save
188,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,his companions. It says nothing of Telemachus and his youthful
189,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"experience, nothing of the grand conflict with the suitors. Hence fault"
190,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,has been found with it in various ways. But it singles out the Hero and
191,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"designates three most important matters concerning him: his knowledge,"
192,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"his suffering, his devotion to his companions. Enough; it has given a"
193,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"start, a light has been put into our hand which beams forward"
194,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"significantly upon the poem, and illumines the mazes of the Hero's"
195,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,character.
196,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
197,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,Mark again the emphatic word in this Invocation; it is the Return
198,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"(_nostos_), the whole Odyssey is the Return, set forth in many"
199,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"gradations, from the shortest and simplest to the longest and"
200,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,profoundest. The idea of the Return dominates the poem from the start;
201,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,into this idea is poured the total experience of Ulysses and his
202,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,companions. The two points between which the Return hovers are also
203,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,given: the capture of Troy and the Greek world. Not a mere book of
204,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,travels or adventure is this; it contains an inner restoration
205,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"corresponding to the outer Return, and the interpreter of the work, if"
206,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"he be true to his function, will trace the interior line of its"
207,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"movement, not neglecting the external side which has also a right to"
208,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,be.
209,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
210,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,_The Obstacles._ Two of these are mentioned and carried back to their
211,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,mythical sources. All the returning heroes are home from Troy except
212,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"the chief one, Ulysses, whom Calypso detains in her grot, ""wishing him"
213,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"to be her husband;"" she, the unmarried, keeps him, the married, from"
214,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"family and country, though he longs to go back to both. She is the"
215,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"daughter of ""the evil-minded Atlas,"" a hoary gigantesque shape of"
216,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"primitive legend, ""who knows the depths of all the sea,""--a dark"
217,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"knowledge of an unseen region, from which come many fatalities, as"
218,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,shipwreck for the Greek sailor or earthquake for the volcanic Greek
219,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"islands; hence he is imagined as ""evil-minded"" by the Greek mythical"
220,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"fancy, which also makes him the supporter of ""the long columns which"
221,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"hold Heaven and Earth apart""--surely a hard task, enough to cause"
222,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,anybody to be in a state of protest and opposition against the happy
223,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,Gods who have nothing to do but enjoy themselves on Olympus. Sometimes
224,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"he refuses to hold the long columns for awhile, then comes the"
225,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"earthquake, in which what is below starts heavenward. Of this Atlas,"
226,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"Calypso is the offspring, and possibly her island, ""the navel of the"
227,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"sea,"" is a product of one of his movements underneath the waters."
228,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
229,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,Here we touch a peculiar vein in the mythical treatment of the Odyssey.
230,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"The fairy-tale, with its comprehensive but dark suggestiveness, is"
231,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,interwoven into the very fibre of the poem. This remote Atlas is the
232,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"father of Calypso, ""the hider,"" who has indeed hidden Ulysses in her"
233,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,island of pleasure which will hereafter be described. But in spite of
234,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"his ""concealment,"" Ulysses has aspiration, which calls down the help of"
235,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"the Gods for fulfillment. Such is the first obstacle, which, we can"
236,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"see, lies somewhere in the sensuous part of human nature."
237,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
238,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"The second obstacle is Neptune, whom we at once think of as the"
239,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,physical sea--certainly a great barrier. The wrath of Neptune is also
240,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"set off with a tale of wonder, which gives the origin of Polyphemus,"
241,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"the Cyclops--a gigantic, monstrous birth of the sea, which produces so"
242,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,many strange and huge shapes of living things. But Neptune is now far
243,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"away, outside of the Greek world, so to speak, among the Ethiopians."
244,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"This implies a finite element in the Gods; they are here, there, and"
245,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,elsewhere; still they have the infinite characteristic also; they
246,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"easily pass from somewhere into everywhere, and Ulysses will not escape"
247,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,Neptune.
248,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
249,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"Such, then, are the two obstacles, both connected far back with"
250,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"mythical beings of the sea, wherein we may note the marine character of"
251,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"the Odyssey, which is a sea-poem, in contrast with the Iliad, which is"
252,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"a land-poem. The physical environment, in which each of these songs has"
253,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"its primary setting, is in deep accord with their respective"
254,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"themes--the one being more objective, singing of the deed, the other"
255,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"being more subjective, singing of the soul."
256,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
257,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"And even in the two present obstacles we may note that the one,"
258,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"Neptune, seems more external--that of the physical sea; while the"
259,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"other, Calypso, seems more internal--that of the soul held in the"
260,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,charms of the senses.
261,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
262,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,_The Assembly of the Gods._ The two obstacles to the return of Ulysses
263,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"are now to be considered by the Gods in council assembled. This is,"
264,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"indeed, the matter of first import; no great action, no great poem is"
265,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"possible outside of the divine order. This order now appears, having a"
266,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,voice; the supreme authority of the world is to utter its decree
267,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,concerning the work. The poet at the start summons before us the
268,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,governing principle of the universe in the persons of the Olympian
269,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"deities. On the other hand, note the solitary individual Ulysses, in a"
270,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"lonely island, with his aspiration for home and country, with his"
271,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,plan--will it be realized? The two sides must come together somehow;
272,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,the plan of the individual must fit into the plan of the Gods; only in
273,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"the cooperation of the human and divine is the deed, especially the"
274,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"great deed, possible. Accordingly we are now to behold far in advance"
275,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"the sweep of the poem, showing whether the man's purpose and hope be in"
276,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,harmony with the government of the Gods.
277,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
278,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"Zeus is the supreme divinity, and he first speaks: ""How sorely mortals"
279,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"blame the Gods!"" It is indeed an alienated discordant time like the"
280,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"primal fall in Eden. But why this blame? ""For they say that evils come"
281,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"from us, the Gods; whereas they, through their own follies, have"
282,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"sorrows beyond what is ordained."" The first words of the highest God"
283,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,concern the highest problem of the poem and of human life. It is a
284,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"wrong theology, at least a wrong Homeric theology, to hold that the"
285,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,Gods are the cause of human ills; these are the consequences of man's
286,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"own actions. Furthermore, the cause is not a blind impersonal power"
287,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"outside of the individual, it is not Fate but man himself. What a lofty"
288,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,utterance! We hear from the supreme tribunal the final decision in
289,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,regard to individual free-will and divine government.
290,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
291,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,Not without significance is this statement put into the mouth of Zeus
292,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,and made his first emphatic declaration. We may read therein how the
293,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,poet would have us look at his poem and the intervention of the Gods.
294,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,We may also infer what is the Homeric view concerning the place of
295,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,divinity in the workings of the world.
296,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
297,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"Such being the command of Zeus, the interpreter has nothing to do but"
298,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,to obey. No longer shall we say that the Gods in this Odyssey destroy
299,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"human freedom, but that they are deeply consistent with it; the divine"
300,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,interference when it takes place is not some external agency beyond the
301,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"man altogether, but is in some way his own nature, veritably the"
302,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,essence of his own will. Such is truly the thing to be seen; the poem
303,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"is a poem of freedom, and yet a poem of providence; for do we not hear"
304,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"providence at the very start declaring man's free-will, and hence his"
305,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"responsibility? The God, then, is not to destroy but to secure human"
306,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"liberty in action, and to assert it on proper occasions. Thus Zeus"
307,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"himself has laid down the law, the fundamental principle of Homer's"
308,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,religion as well as of his poem.
309,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
310,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"Have the Gods, then, nothing to do in this world? Certainly they have,"
311,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,and this is the next point upon which we shall hear our supreme
312,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"authority, Zeus. He has in mind the case of Ægisthus whom the Gods"
313,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,warned not to do the wicked deed; still he did it in spite of the
314,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"warning, and there followed the penalty. So the Gods admonish the"
315,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"wrong-doer, sending down their bright-flashing messenger Hermes, and"
316,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,declaring through him the great law of justice: the deed will return
317,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,unto the doer. Zeus has now given expression to the law which governs
318,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"the world; it is truly his law, above all caprice. Moreover, the God"
319,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,gives a warning to the sinner; a divine mercy he shows even in the
320,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,heathen world.
321,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
322,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"The case of Ægisthus, which Zeus has in mind, is indeed a striking"
323,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,example of a supreme justice which smites the most exalted and
324,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,successful criminal. It made a profound impression upon the Greek
325,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"world, and took final shape in the sublime tragedy of Æschylus."
326,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"Throughout the _Odyssey_ the fateful story peeps from the background,"
327,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"and strongly hints what is to become of the suitors of Penelope, who"
328,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,are seeking to do to Ulysses what Ægisthus did to Agamemnon. They will
329,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"perish, is the decree; thus we behold at the beginning of the poem an"
330,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"image which foreshadows the end. That is the image of Ægisthus, upon"
331,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,whom vengeance came for the wrongful deed.
332,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
333,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"The Gods, then, do really exist; they are the law and the voice of the"
334,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"law also, to which man may hearken if he will; but he can disobey, if"
335,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"he choose, and bring upon himself the consequences. The law exists as"
336,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"the first fact in the world, and will work itself out with the Gods as"
337,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,executors. Is not this a glorious starting-point for a poem which
338,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,proposes to reveal the ways of providence unto men? The idea of the
339,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"Homeric world-order is now before us, which we may sum up as follows:"
340,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"the Gods are in the man, in his reason and conscience, as we moderns"
341,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"say; but they are also outside of man, in the world, of which they are"
342,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"rulers. The two sides, divine and human, must be made one; the grand"
343,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,dualism between heaven and earth must be overcome in the deed of the
344,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"hero, as well as in the thought of the reader. When the God appears, it"
345,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,is to raise man out of himself into the universal realm where lies his
346,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"true being. Again, let it be affirmed that the deities are not an"
347,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"external fate, not freedom-destroying power, but freedom-fulfilling,"
348,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,since they burst the narrow limits of the mere individual and elevate
349,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,him into unity and harmony with the divine order. There he is truly
350,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,free.
351,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
352,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,Thus we hear Zeus in his first speech announcing from Olympus the two
353,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"great laws which govern the world, as well as this poem--that of"
354,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"freedom and that of justice. The latter, indeed, springs from the"
355,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"former; if man be free, he must be held responsible and receive the"
356,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"penalty of the wicked deed. Moreover, it is the fundamental law of"
357,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,criticism for the _Odyssey_; freedom and justice we are to see in it
358,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,and unfold them in accord with the divine order; woe be to the critic
359,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"who disobeys the decree of Zeus, and sees in his poem only an amusing"
360,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"tale, or a sun-myth perchance."
361,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
362,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"But here is Pallas Athena speaking to the supreme deity, and noting"
363,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"what seems to be an exception. It is the case of Ulysses, who always"
364,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"""gave sacrifices to the immortal Gods,"" who has done his duty, and"
365,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,wishes to return to family and country. Pallas hints the difficulty;
366,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"Calypso the charmer, seeks to detain him in her isle from his wedded"
367,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,wife and to make him forget Ithaca; but she cannot. Strong is his
368,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"aspiration, he is eager to break the trance of the fair nymph, and the"
369,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"Gods must help him, when he is ready to help himself. Else, indeed,"
370,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"they were not Gods. Then there is the second obstacle, Neptune; he,"
371,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"""only one,"" cannot hold out ""against all,"" for the All now decrees the"
372,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"restoration of the wanderer. Verily it is the voice of the totality,"
373,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"which is here uttered by Zeus, ordering the return of Ulysses; the"
374,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"reason of the world we may also call it, if that will help the little"
375,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,brain take in the great thought.
376,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
377,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,But we must not forget the other side. This divine power is not simply
378,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,external; the mighty hand of Zeus is not going to pick up Ulysses from
379,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"Calypso's island, and set him down in Ithaca. He must return through"
380,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"himself, yet must fit into the providential order. Both sides are"
381,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"touched upon by Zeus; Ulysses ""excels mortals in intelligence,"" and he"
382,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"will now require it all; but he also ""gives sacrifices to the Gods"
383,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"exceedingly,"" that is, he seeks to find out the will of the Gods and"
384,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"adjust himself thereto. Intellect and piety both he has, often in"
385,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"conflict, but in concord at last. With that keen understanding of his"
386,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,he will repeatedly fall into doubt concerning the divine purpose; but
387,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,out of doubt he rises into a new harmony.
388,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
389,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"When the decree of the Highest has been given, Pallas at once organizes"
390,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"the return of Ulysses, and therewith the poem. This falls into three"
391,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,large divisions:--
392,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
393,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"I. Pallas goes to Ithaca to rouse Telemachus, who is just entering"
394,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"manhood, to be a second Ulysses. He is to give the divine warning to"
395,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,the guilty suitors; then he is to go to Pylos and Sparta in order to
396,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"inquire about his father, who is the great pattern for the son. Thus we"
397,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,have a book of education for the Homeric youth whose learning came
398,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,through example and through the living word of wisdom from the lips of
399,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"the old and experienced man. This part embraces the first four Books,"
400,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,which may be called the Telemachiad.
401,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
402,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"II. Mercury is sent to Calypso to bid the nymph release Ulysses, who at"
403,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,once makes his raft and starts on his voyage homeward. In this second
404,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,part we shall have the entire story of the Hero from the time he leaves
405,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"Troy, till he reaches Ithaca in the 13th Book. As Telemachus the youth"
406,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"is to have his period of education (_Lehrjahre_), so Ulysses the man is"
407,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,to have his experience of the journey of life (_Wanderjahre_). Both
408,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"parts belong together, making a complete work on the education of man,"
409,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,as it could be had in that old Greek world. This part is the Odyssey
410,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"proper, or the Ulyssiad."
411,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
412,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,III. The third part brings together father and son in Ithaca; then it
413,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"portrays them uniting to perform the great deed of justice, the"
414,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"punishment of the suitors. This part embraces the last twelve Books,"
415,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,but is not distinctly set forth in the plan of Pallas as here given.
416,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
417,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"Such is the structure of the poem, which is organized in its main"
418,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"outlines from Olympus. It is Pallas, the deity of wisdom, who has"
419,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"ordered it in this way; her we shall follow, in preference to the"
420,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"critics, and unfold the interpretation on the same organic lines. Every"
421,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,reader will feel that the three great joints of the poetical body are
422,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"truly foreshadowed by the Goddess, who indeed is the constructive"
423,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,principle of the poem. One likes to see this belief of the old singer
424,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"that his work was of divine origin, was actually planned upon Olympus"
425,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,by Pallas in accordance with the decree of Zeus. So at least the Muses
426,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"have told him, and they were present. But the grandest utterance here"
427,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"is that of Zeus, the Greek Providence, proclaiming man's free will."
428,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
429,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,Very old and still very new is the problem of the Odyssey; with a
430,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,little care we can see that the Homeric Greek had to solve in his way
431,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"what every one of us still has to solve, namely, the problem of life."
432,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,Only yesterday one might have heard the popular preacher of a great
433,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"city, a kind of successor to Homer, blazoning the following text as his"
434,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"theme: God is not to blame. Thus the great poem has an eternal subject,"
435,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,though its outer garb be much changed by time. The soul of Homer is
436,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"ethical, and that is what makes him immortal. Not till we realize this"
437,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,"fact, can we be said in any true sense, to understand him."
438,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
439,_BOOK FIRST--INTRODUCTION._,
440,TELEMACHIAD.,TELEMACHIAD.
441,TELEMACHIAD.,
442,TELEMACHIAD.,"The Introduction being concluded, the story of Telemachus begins, and"
443,TELEMACHIAD.,continues till the Fifth Book. Two main points stand forth in the
444,TELEMACHIAD.,"narrative. The first is the grand conflict with the suitors, the men of"
445,TELEMACHIAD.,"guilt, the disturbers of the divine order; this conflict runs through"
446,TELEMACHIAD.,"to the end of the poem, where they are swept out of the world which"
447,TELEMACHIAD.,they have thrown into discord. The second point of the Telemachiad is
448,TELEMACHIAD.,"the education of Telemachus, which is indeed the chief fact of these"
449,TELEMACHIAD.,Books; the youth is to be trained to meet the conflict which is looming
450,TELEMACHIAD.,up before him in the distance. Thus we have one of the first
451,TELEMACHIAD.,"educational books of the race, the very first possibly; it still has"
452,TELEMACHIAD.,many valuable hints for the educator of the present age. Its method is
453,TELEMACHIAD.,"that of oral tradition, which has by no means lost its place in a true"
454,TELEMACHIAD.,discipline of the human spirit. Living wisdom has its advantage to-day
455,TELEMACHIAD.,over the dead lore of the text-books.
456,TELEMACHIAD.,
457,TELEMACHIAD.,Very delightful is the school to which we see Telemachus going in these
458,TELEMACHIAD.,"four Books. Heroes are his instructors, men of the deed as well as of"
459,TELEMACHIAD.,"the word, and the source from which all instruction is derived is the"
460,TELEMACHIAD.,"greatest event of the age, the Trojan War. The young man is to learn"
461,TELEMACHIAD.,"what that event was, what sacrifices it required, what characters it"
462,TELEMACHIAD.,"developed among his people. He is to see and converse with Nestor,"
463,TELEMACHIAD.,"famous at Troy for eloquence and wisdom. Then he will go to Menelaus,"
464,TELEMACHIAD.,"who has had an experience wider than the Trojan experience, for the"
465,TELEMACHIAD.,"latter has been in Egypt. Young Telemachus is also to behold Helen,"
466,TELEMACHIAD.,"beautiful Helen, the central figure of the great struggle. Finally, he"
467,TELEMACHIAD.,"is to learn much about his father, and thus be prepared for the"
468,TELEMACHIAD.,approaching conflict with the suitors in Ithaca.
469,TELEMACHIAD.,
470,TELEMACHIAD.,_Book First specially._ After the total Odyssey has been organized on
471,TELEMACHIAD.,"Olympus, it begins at once to descend to earth and to realize itself"
472,TELEMACHIAD.,"there. For the great poem springs from the Divine Idea, and must show"
473,TELEMACHIAD.,its origin in the course of its own unfolding. Hence the Gods are the
474,TELEMACHIAD.,"starting-point of the Odyssey, and their will goes before the"
475,TELEMACHIAD.,"terrestrial deed; moreover, the one decree of theirs overarches the"
476,TELEMACHIAD.,"poem from beginning to end, as the heavens bend over man wherever he"
477,TELEMACHIAD.,may take his stand. Still there will be many special interventions and
478,TELEMACHIAD.,reminders from the Gods during this poetical journey.
479,TELEMACHIAD.,
480,TELEMACHIAD.,"In accordance with the Olympian plan, Pallas takes her flight down to"
481,TELEMACHIAD.,"Ithaca, after binding on her winged sandals and seizing her mighty"
482,TELEMACHIAD.,"spear; thus she humanizes herself to the Greek plastic sense, and"
483,TELEMACHIAD.,"assumes finite form, adopting the shape of a stranger, Mentes, King of"
484,TELEMACHIAD.,the Taphians. She finds a world full of wrong; violence and disorder
485,TELEMACHIAD.,rule in the house of the absent Ulysses; it is indeed high time for the
486,TELEMACHIAD.,Gods to come down from lofty Olympus and bring peace and right into the
487,TELEMACHIAD.,course of things. Let the divine image now be stamped upon terrestrial
488,TELEMACHIAD.,"affairs, and bring harmony out of strife. Still, it must not be"
489,TELEMACHIAD.,forgotten that the work has to be done through man's own activity.
490,TELEMACHIAD.,
491,TELEMACHIAD.,The conflict which unfolds before our eyes in a series of clear-drawn
492,TELEMACHIAD.,"classic pictures, lies between the House of Ulysses on the one hand and"
493,TELEMACHIAD.,the Suitors of Penelope on the other. He who is the head of the Family
494,TELEMACHIAD.,"and the ruler of State, Ulysses, has been absent for twenty years;"
495,TELEMACHIAD.,"godless men have taken advantage of the youth of his son, and are"
496,TELEMACHIAD.,consuming his substance wantonly; they also are wooing his wife who has
497,TELEMACHIAD.,only her cunning wherewith to help herself. The son and wife are now to
498,TELEMACHIAD.,be brought before us in their struggle with their bitter lot. Thus we
499,TELEMACHIAD.,note the two main divisions in the structure of the present Book: The
500,TELEMACHIAD.,House of Ulysses and the Suitors.
501,TELEMACHIAD.,
502,TELEMACHIAD.,
503,I.,I.
504,I.,
505,I.,The Goddess Pallas has already come down to Ithaca and stands among the
506,I.,"suitors. She has taken the form of Mentes, the King of a neighboring"
507,I.,tribe; she is in disguise as she usually is when she appears on earth.
508,I.,Who will recognize her? Not the suitors; they can see no God in their
509,I.,"condition, least of all, the Goddess of Wisdom. ""Telemachus was much"
510,I.,"the first to observe her;"" why just he? The fact is he was ready to see"
511,I.,"her, and not only to see her, but to hear what she had to say. ""For he"
512,I.,"sat among the suitors grieved in heart, seeing his father in his mind's"
513,I.,"eye,"" like Hamlet just before the latter saw the ghost. So careful is"
514,I.,"the poet to prepare both sides--the divine epiphany, and the mortal who"
515,I.,is to behold it.
516,I.,
517,I.,"Furthermore, the young man saw his father ""scattering the suitors and"
518,I.,"himself obtaining honor and ruling his own house."" This is just what"
519,I.,"the Goddess is going to tell with a new sanction, and it is just what"
520,I.,is going to happen in the course of the poem. Truly Telemachus is
521,I.,prepared internally; he has already everything within him which is to
522,I.,come out of him. Throughout the whole interview the two main facts are
523,I.,"the example of the parent and the final revenge, both of which are"
524,I.,urged by the Goddess without and by the man within.
525,I.,
526,I.,Still there is a difference. Telemachus is despondent; we might almost
527,I.,"say, he is getting to disbelieve in any divine order of the world. ""The"
528,I.,"Gods plot evil things"" against the House of Ulysses, whose fate ""they"
529,I.,"make unknown above that of all men."" Then they have sent upon me these"
530,I.,suitors who consume my heritage. The poor boy has had a hard time; he
531,I.,"has come to question providence in his misery, and discredits the"
532,I.,goodness of the Gods.
533,I.,
534,I.,"Here, now, is the special function of Pallas. She instills courage into"
535,I.,"his heart. She gives strong hope of the return of his father, who ""will"
536,I.,"not long be absent from Ithaca;"" she also hints the purpose of the"
537,I.,"Gods, which is on the point of fulfillment. Be no longer a child;"
538,I.,follow the example of thy father; go and learn about him and emulate
539,I.,his deeds. Therewith the Goddess furnishes to the doubting youth a plan
540,I.,of immediate action--altogether the best thing for throwing off his
541,I.,"mental paralysis. He is to proceed at once to Pylos and to Sparta ""to"
542,I.,"learn of his father"" with the final outlook toward the destruction of"
543,I.,"the suitors. She is a veritable Goddess to the young striver, speaking"
544,I.,"the word of hope and wisdom, and then turning him back upon himself."
545,I.,
546,I.,Here again we must say that the Goddess was in the heart of Telemachus
547,I.,"uttering her spirit, yet she was external to him also. Her voice is the"
548,I.,"voice of the time, of the reality; all things are fluid to the hand of"
549,I.,"Telemachus, and ready to be moulded to his scheme. Still the Goddess is"
550,I.,"in him just as well, is his thought, his wisdom, which has now become"
551,I.,one with the reason of the world. Both sides are brought together by
552,I.,the Poet in the most emphatic manner; this is the supreme fact in his
553,I.,procedure. The subjective and objective elements are one; the divine
554,I.,"order puts its seal on the thought of the man, unites with him, makes"
555,I.,"his plan its plan. Thus the God and the Individual are in harmony, and"
556,I.,the great fulfillment becomes possible. But if the thought of
557,I.,"Telemachus were a mere scheme of his own, if it had not received the"
558,I.,"stamp of divinity, then it could never become the deed, the heroic"
559,I.,"deed, which stands forth in the world existent in its own right and"
560,I.,eternal.
561,I.,
562,I.,"The Goddess flits away, ""like a bird,"" in speed and silence. Telemachus"
563,I.,now recognizes that the stranger was a divinity. For has he not the
564,I.,proof in his own heart? He is indeed a new person or the beginning
565,I.,"thereof. But hark to this song! It is the bard singing ""the sad return"
566,I.,"of the Greeks""--the very song which the poet himself is now singing in"
567,I.,"this Odyssey. For it is also a sad return, indeed many sad returns, as"
568,I.,we shall see hereafter. Homer has thus put himself into his poem
569,I.,"singing his poem. Who cannot feel that this touch is taken from life,"
570,I.,is an echo of his own experience in some princely hall?
571,I.,
572,I.,"But here she comes, the grand lady of the story, Penelope, the wife of"
573,I.,"Ulysses, as it were in response to the music. A glorious appearance at"
574,I.,"a happy moment; yet she is not happy: ""Holding a veil before her face,"
575,I.,"and shedding tears, she bespoke the bard: Phemius cease from this sad"
576,I.,"song, it cuts me to the heart."" It reminds her of her husband and his"
577,I.,"sorrowful return, not yet accomplished; she cannot endure the anguish"
578,I.,and she begs the bard to sing another strain which may delight his
579,I.,hearers.
580,I.,
581,I.,"This, then, is the sage Penelope whose character will be tested in many"
582,I.,"ways, and move through many subtle turns to the end of the poem. In"
583,I.,this her first appearance we note that she proclaims in the presence of
584,I.,the suitors her undying love for her husband. This trait we may fairly
585,I.,consider to be the deepest of her nature. She thinks of him continually
586,I.,and weeps at his absence. Still she has her problem which requires at
587,I.,"times all her female tact, yes, even dissimulation. Reckless suitors"
588,I.,"are pressing for her hand, she has to employ all her arts to defer the"
589,I.,hateful marriage; otherwise she is helpless. She is the counterpart of
590,I.,"her husband, a female Ulysses, who has waited twenty years for his"
591,I.,"return. She also has had a stormy time, with the full experience of"
592,I.,life; her adventures in her world rival his in his world. But
593,I.,underneath all her cunning is the rock of eternal fidelity. She went
594,I.,"back to her room, and wept for her husband ""till Pallas closed her"
595,I.,"eye-lids in sweet sleep."""
596,I.,
597,I.,"Nor can we pass over the answer of Telemachus, which he makes at this"
598,I.,point to his mother. It may be called a little Homeric treatise on
599,I.,"poetry. ""Mother, let the poet sing as his spirit moves him;"" he is not"
600,I.,"to be constrained, but must give the great fact; ""poets are not to"
601,I.,"blame but Zeus,"" for the sad return of the Greeks; ""men applaud the"
602,I.,"song which is newest,"" novelty being already sought for in the"
603,I.,"literature of Homer's time. But the son's harsh reproof of the mother,"
604,I.,"with which his speech closes, bidding her look after her own affairs,"
605,I.,"the loom and distaff and servants, is probably an interpolation. Such"
606,I.,"is the judgment of Aristarchus, the greatest ancient commentator on"
607,I.,"Homer; such is also the judgment of Professor Nitzsch, the greatest"
608,I.,modern commentator on the Odyssey.
609,I.,
610,I.,
611,II.,II.
612,II.,
613,II.,"The other side of the collision is the party of suitors, who assail the"
614,II.,"House of Ulysses in property, in the son, in the wife, and finally in"
615,II.,Ulysses himself. They are the wrong-doers whose deeds are to be avenged
616,II.,by the returning hero; their punishment will exemplify the faith in an
617,II.,"ethical order of the world, upon which the poem reposes as its very"
618,II.,"foundation. They are insolent, debauched, unjust; they defy the"
619,II.,"established right. Zeus has them in mind when he speaks of Ægisthus,"
620,II.,"who is an example of the same sort of characters, and his fate is their"
621,II.,fate according to the Olympian lawgiver. They too are going to
622,II.,"destruction through their own folly, yet after many an admonition. Just"
623,II.,"now Telemachus has spoken an impressive warning: ""I shall invoke the"
624,II.,"ever-living Gods, that Zeus may grant deeds requiting yours."""
625,II.,
626,II.,Still their insolence goes on; the ethical world of justice and
627,II.,"institutions has to be cleared of such men, if it continue to exist."
628,II.,Who does not love this fealty of the old bard to the highest order of
629,II.,things? The suitors are indeed blind; they have not recognized the
630,II.,"presence of the Goddess, yet there is a slight suspicion after she is"
631,II.,"gone; one of the suitors asks who that stranger was. Telemachus, to"
632,II.,"lull inquiry, gives the outer assumed form of the divine visitor, ""an"
633,II.,"ancestral guest, Mentes of Taphos;"" the poet however, is careful to"
634,II.,"add: ""But he (Telemachus) knew the immortal Goddess in his mind."""
635,II.,
636,II.,The conflict with the suitors is the framework of the entire poem. The
637,II.,education of Telemachus as well as the discipline of Ulysses reach
638,II.,"forward to this practical end--the destruction of the wrong-doers,"
639,II.,"which is the purification of the country, and the re-establishment of"
640,II.,the ethical order. All training is to bring forth the heroic act. The
641,II.,next Book will unfold the conflict in greater detail.
642,II.,
643,II.,"_Appendix._ The reader will have observed that, in the preceding"
644,II.,"account of Book First, it is regarded as setting forth three unities,"
645,II.,"that of the total Odyssey, that of the Telemachiad, and that of the"
646,II.,Book itself. We see them all gradually unfolding in due order under the
647,II.,"hand of the poet, from the largest to the least. Now the reader should"
648,II.,be informed that every one of these unities has been violently attacked
649,II.,and proclaimed to be a sheer phantasm. Chiefly in Germany has the
650,II.,assault taken place. What we have above considered as the joints in the
651,II.,"organism of the poem, have been cut into, pried apart, and declared to"
652,II.,"make so many separate poems or passages, which different authors have"
653,II.,"written. Thus the one great Homer vanishes into many little Homers, and"
654,II.,this is claimed to be the only true way of appreciating Homer.
655,II.,
656,II.,The most celebrated of these dissectors is probably the German
657,II.,"Professor, Kirchhoff, some of whose opinions we shall cite in this"
658,II.,"appendix. His psychological tendency is that of analysis, separation,"
659,II.,"division; the very idea of unity seems a bugbear to him, a mighty"
660,II.,delusion which he must demolish or die. Specially is his wrath directed
661,II.,"against Book First, probably because it contains the three unities"
662,II.,"above mentioned, all of which he assails and rends to shreds in his own"
663,II.,opinion.
664,II.,
665,II.,The entire Introduction (lines 1-88) he tears from its present place
666,II.,"and puts it before the Fifth Book, where it serves as the prelude to"
667,II.,the Calypso tale. The rest of the Telemachiad is the work of another
668,II.,poet. Indeed the rest of the First Book (after the Introduction) is not
669,II.,by the same man who produced the Second Book. Then the Second Book is
670,II.,"certainly older than the First, and ought somehow to be placed before"
671,II.,"it. The real truth is, however, that the First Book is only a"
672,II.,"hodge-podge made out of the Second Book by an inferior poet, who took"
673,II.,thence fragments of sentences and of ideas and stitched them together.
674,II.,In the Invocation Kirchhoff cuts out the allusion to the oxen of the
675,II.,Sun (lines 6-9) as being inconsistent with his theory.
676,II.,
677,II.,"After disposing of the Introduction in this way, Kirchhoff takes up the"
678,II.,"remaining portion of the First Book, which he tears to pieces almost"
679,II.,line by line. In about forty separate notes on different passages he
680,II.,"marks points for skepticism, having in the main one procedure: he hunts"
681,II.,"both the Iliad and the Odyssey through, and if he finds a line or"
682,II.,"phrase, and even a word used elsewhere, which he has observed here, he"
683,II.,at once is inclined to conclude that the same must have been taken
684,II.,thence and put here by a foreign hand. Every reader of Homer is
685,II.,"familiar with his habit of repeating lines and even entire passages,"
686,II.,when necessary. All such repetitions Kirchhoff seizes upon as signs of
687,II.,"different authorship; the poet must have used the one, some redactor or"
688,II.,imitator the other. To be sure we ought to have a criterion by which we
689,II.,can tell which is the original and which is the derived; but such a
690,II.,"criterion Kirchhoff fails to furnish, we must accept his judgment as"
691,II.,"imperial and final. Once or twice, indeed, he seems to feel the"
692,II.,"faultiness of his procedure, and tries to bolster it, but as a rule he"
693,II.,"speaks thus: ""The following verse is a formula (repetition), and"
694,II.,"_hence_ not the property of the author."" (_Die Homerische Odyssee_, p."
695,II.,174.)
696,II.,
697,II.,"Now such repetitions are common in all old poetry, in the ballad, in"
698,II.,"the folk-song, in the _Kalevala_ as well as in the Homeric poems."
699,II.,Messages sent are repeated naturally when delivered; the same event
700,II.,"recurring, as when the boat is rowed, the banquet prepared, or the"
701,II.,"armor put on, is described in the same language. Such is usually felt"
702,II.,"to be a mark of epic simplicity, of the naive use of language, which"
703,II.,will not vary a phrase merely for the sake of variety. But Kirchhoff
704,II.,and his followers will have it just the other way; the early poet never
705,II.,"varies or repeats, only the later poet does that. So he seeks out a"
706,II.,"large number of passages in the rest of the Odyssey, and in the Iliad"
707,II.,"also, which have something in common with passages of this First Book,"
708,II.,"especially in the matter of words, and easily finds it to be a ""cento,"""
709,II.,a mixed mass of borrowed phrases.
710,II.,
711,II.,"But who was the author of such work? Not the original Homer, but some"
712,II.,"later matcher and patcher, imitator or redactor. It is not easy to tell"
713,II.,from Kirchhoff just how many persons may have had a hand in this making
714,II.,"of the Odyssey, as it lies before us. In his dissertations we read of a"
715,II.,"motley multitude: original poet, continuator, interpolator, redactor,"
716,II.,"reconstructor, imitator, author of the older part, author of the newer"
717,II.,"part--not merely individuals, but apparently classes of men. Thus he"
718,II.,anatomizes old Homer with a vengeance.

723,_BOOK SECOND._,_BOOK SECOND._
724,_BOOK SECOND._,
725,_BOOK SECOND._,
726,_BOOK SECOND._,The general relation between the First and Second Books is to be
727,_BOOK SECOND._,grasped at once. In the First Book the main fact is the Assembly in the
728,_BOOK SECOND._,"Upper World, together with the descent of the divine influence which"
729,_BOOK SECOND._,"through Pallas comes to Telemachus in person, gives him courage and"
730,_BOOK SECOND._,stirs him to action. This action is to bring harmony into the
731,_BOOK SECOND._,discordant land. In the Second Book the main fact is the Assembly in
732,_BOOK SECOND._,"the Lower World, together with the rise of Telemachus into a new"
733,_BOOK SECOND._,"participation with divine influence in the form of Pallas, who sends"
734,_BOOK SECOND._,"him forth on his journey of education. We behold, therefore, in the two"
735,_BOOK SECOND._,"Books a sweep from above to below, then from below back to the divine"
736,_BOOK SECOND._,"influence. Earth and Olympus are the halves of the cycle, but the Earth"
737,_BOOK SECOND._,is in discord and must be transformed to the harmony of Olympus.
738,_BOOK SECOND._,
739,_BOOK SECOND._,"Looking now at the Second Book by itself, we note that it falls into"
740,_BOOK SECOND._,"two portions: the Assembly of the People, which has been called"
741,_BOOK SECOND._,"together by Telemachus, and the communion of the youth with Pallas, who"
742,_BOOK SECOND._,"again appears to him at his call. The first is a mundane matter, and"
743,_BOOK SECOND._,shows the Lower World in conflict with the divine order--the sides
744,_BOOK SECOND._,being the Suitors on the one hand and the House of Ulysses on the
745,_BOOK SECOND._,other. The second portion lifts the young hero into a vision of
746,_BOOK SECOND._,"divinity, and should lift the reader along with him. Previously Pallas"
747,_BOOK SECOND._,"had, as it were, descended into Telemachus, but now he rises of himself"
748,_BOOK SECOND._,"into the Goddess. Clearly he possesses a new power, that of communion"
749,_BOOK SECOND._,with the Gods. These two leading thoughts divide the Book into two
750,_BOOK SECOND._,"well-marked parts--the first including lines 1-259, the second"
751,_BOOK SECOND._,including the rest.
752,_BOOK SECOND._,
753,_BOOK SECOND._,
754,I.,I.
755,I.,
756,I.,The Assembly of the Ithacans presupposes a political habit of gathering
757,I.,into the town-meeting and consulting upon common interests. This usage
758,I.,"is common to the Aryan race, and from it spring parliaments,"
759,I.,"congresses, and other cognate institutions, together with oratory"
760,I.,before the People. A wonderful development has come of this little
761,I.,"germ, which we see here still alive in Ithaca, though it has been"
762,I.,almost choked by the unhappy condition of things. Not since Ulysses
763,I.,"left has there been any such Assembly, says the first speaker, an old"
764,I.,"man drawing upon his memory, not for twenty years; surely a sign of"
765,I.,smothered institutional life. The first thing which Telemachus in his
766,I.,"new career does is to call the Assembly, and start this institutional"
767,I.,life into activity again. Whereof we feel the fresh throb in the words
768,I.,"of the aged speaker, who calls him ""Blessed."""
769,I.,
770,I.,"Now the oratory begins, as it must begin in such a place. The golden"
771,I.,"gift of eloquence is highly prized by Homer, and by the Homeric People;"
772,I.,"prophetic it is, one always thinks of the great Attic orators. The"
773,I.,speakers are distinctly marked in character by their speeches; but the
774,I.,Assembly itself seems to remain dumb; it was evidently divided into two
775,I.,"parties; one well-disposed to the House of Ulysses, the other to the"
776,I.,Suitors. The corruption of the time has plainly entered the soul of the
777,I.,"People, and thorough must be the cleansing by the Gods. Two kinds of"
778,I.,"speakers we notice also, on the same lines, supporting each side; thus"
779,I.,the discord of Ithaca is now to be reflected in its oratory. Three sets
780,I.,"of orators speak on each side, placing before us the different phases"
781,I.,of the case; these we shall mark off for the thought and for the eye of
782,I.,the reader.
783,I.,
784,I.,"1. After the short opening speech of the old man, Ægyptius, the heart"
785,I.,"of the whole movement utters itself in Telemachus, who remains the"
786,I.,chief speaker throughout. His speech is strong and bold; from it two
787,I.,"main points peer forth. The first is the wrong of the Suitors, who will"
788,I.,not take the right way of wooing Penelope by going to her father and
789,I.,"giving the bridal gift according to custom, but consume the son's"
790,I.,property under pretense of their suit for the mother. The second point
791,I.,"is the strong appeal to the Ithacans--to their sense of right, to their"
792,I.,"sense of shame, and to their fear of the Gods, who ""in their divine"
793,I.,"wrath shall turn back ill deeds upon the doer."" But in vain; that"
794,I.,"Ithacan Assembly contains friends and relatives of the Suitors, and"
795,I.,"possibly purchased adherents; nay, it contains some of the Suitors"
796,I.,"themselves, and here rises one of them to make a speech in reply."
797,I.,
798,I.,"This is Antinous, who now makes the most elaborate defense of the case"
799,I.,of the Suitors that is to be found in the poem. The speech is
800,I.,remarkable for throwing the whole blame upon Penelope--not a gallant
801,I.,proceeding in a lover; still it betrays great admiration for the woman
802,I.,on account of her devices and her cunning. She has thwarted and fooled
803,I.,the whole band of unwelcome wooers for three years and more by her
804,I.,"wonderful web, which she wove by day and unraveled by night. And even"
805,I.,"now when she has been found out, she holds them aloof but keeps them in"
806,I.,"good humor, though clearly at a great expense of the family's property,"
807,I.,"which fact has roused Telemachus to his protest. Antinous, though"
808,I.,"feeling that he and the rest have been outwitted by the woman, does not"
809,I.,"stint his praise on that account, he even heightens it."
810,I.,
811,I.,"But we hear also his ultimatum: ""Send thy mother away and bid her be"
812,I.,"married to whomsoever her father commands, and whoso is pleasing to"
813,I.,"her."" So the will of the parent and the choice of the daughter had to"
814,I.,go together even in Homer's days. Of course Antinous has no ground of
815,I.,"right for giving this order; he is not the master of the house, though"
816,I.,he hopes to be; his assumed authority is pure insolence. Then why
817,I.,should the Suitors injure the son because they have been wheedled by
818,I.,"the mother? Still they will continue to consume ""his living and his"
819,I.,"wealth as long as she keeps her present mind."""
820,I.,
821,I.,But the most interesting thing in his speech is to discover the
822,I.,"attitude and motives of Penelope. We see her fidelity, but something"
823,I.,"more than fidelity is now needed, namely the greatest skill,"
824,I.,"dissimulation, or female tact, to use the more genteel word. She has a"
825,I.,"hard problem on her hands; she has to save her son, herself, and as"
826,I.,"much of the estate as she can, from a set of bandits who have all in"
827,I.,"their might. Were she to undertake to drive them away, they would"
828,I.,"pillage the house, kill her boy, and certainly carry her off. They have"
829,I.,"the power, they have the inclination; they are held by one small thread"
830,I.,"in the weak hands of a woman, but with that thread she snares them all,"
831,I.,"to the last man. Love it may be called, of a certain sort; we see how"
832,I.,"Antinous admires her, though conscious that she has made a fool of him"
833,I.,"and his fellows. Each hopes to win the prize yet, and she feeds them"
834,I.,"with hope, ""sending private messages to each man;"" thus she turns every"
835,I.,"one of them against the other, and prevents concerted action which"
836,I.,"looks to violence. That wonderful female gift is hers, the gift of"
837,I.,making each of her hundred Suitors think that just he is the favored
838,I.,"one, only let it be kept secret now till the right time comes!"
839,I.,
840,I.,"But Penelope uses this gift as a weapon, it is her means of saving the"
841,I.,"House of Ulysses, while many another fair lady uses it for the fun of"
842,I.,the thing. Is she right? Does her end justify her means? True she is in
843,I.,"the highest degree to Family and State, is saving both; but she does"
844,I.,"dissemble, does cajole the suitors. One boy, one woman, one old man in"
845,I.,the country constitute the present strength of the House of Ulysses;
846,I.,"but craft meets violence and undoes it, as always."
847,I.,
848,I.,And yet we may grant something to the other side of her character. She
849,I.,"takes pleasure in the exercise of her gift, who does not? Inasmuch as"
850,I.,"the Suitors are here, and not to be dismissed, she will get a certain"
851,I.,"gratification out of their suit. A little dash of coquetry, a little"
852,I.,love of admiration we may discern peeping through her adamantine
853,I.,"fidelity to her husband, recollect after an absence of twenty years. As"
854,I.,"all this homage was thrust upon her, she seeks to win from it a kind of"
855,I.,satisfaction; the admiration of a hundred men she tries to receive
856,I.,without making a sour face. Still further she takes pleasure in the
857,I.,"exercise of that feminine subtlety which holds them fast in the web,"
858,I.,"yet keeps them off; giving them always hope, but indefinitely extending"
859,I.,it. Verily that web which she wove is the web of Fate for the Suitors.
860,I.,"So much for Penelope at present, whom we shall meet again."
861,I.,
862,I.,"To this demand of Antinous to send the mother away, Telemachus makes a"
863,I.,"noble, yes, a heroic response. It would be wrong all around, wrong to"
864,I.,"the mother, wrong to her father, unless he (Telemachus) restored the"
865,I.,"dower, wrong to the Gods; vengeance from the Erinyes, and nemesis from"
866,I.,man would come upon him for such a deed. Thus the young hero appeals to
867,I.,the divine order and puts himself in harmony with its behests. Boldly
868,I.,"he declares, that if the Suitors continue in their ill-doing, ""I shall"
869,I.,invoke the ever-living Gods; if Zeus may grant fit retribution for your
870,I.,"crimes, ye shall die within this palace unavenged."" Truly a speech"
871,I.,"given with a power which brings fulfillment; prophetic it must be, if"
872,I.,there be any Gods in the world. Already we have seen that Telemachus
873,I.,"was capable of this high mood, which communes with deity and utters the"
874,I.,"decree from above. Behold, no sooner is the word uttered by the mortal,"
875,I.,"than we have the divine response. It is in the form of an omen, the"
876,I.,flight of two eagles tearing each other as they fly to the right
877,I.,"through the houses of the town. Also the interpreter is present, who"
878,I.,"tells the meaning of the sign, and stamps the words of Telemachus with"
879,I.,the seal of the Gods.
880,I.,
881,I.,2. Here we pass to the second set of speeches which show more
882,I.,"distinctively the religious phase, in contrast to the preceding set,"
883,I.,"which show rather the institutional phase, of the conflict; that is,"
884,I.,"the Gods are the theme of the one, Family and State of the other. The"
885,I.,"old augur Halitherses, the man of religion, explains the omen in full"
886,I.,harmony with what Telemachus has said; he prophesies the speedy return
887,I.,"of Ulysses and the punishment of the Suitors, unless they desist. Well"
888,I.,"may the aged prophet foretell some such outcome, after seeing the"
889,I.,"spirit of the son; Vengeance is indeed in the air, and is felt by the"
890,I.,"sensitive seer, and also by the sensitive reader."
891,I.,
892,I.,But what is the attitude of the Suitors toward such a view? Eurymachus
893,I.,"is the name of their speaker now, manifestly a representative man of"
894,I.,"their kind. He derides the prophet: ""Go home, old man, and forecast for"
895,I.,"thy children!"" He is a scoffer and skeptic; truly a spokesman of the"
896,I.,"Suitors in their relation to the Gods, in whom they can have no living"
897,I.,faith; through long wickedness they imagine that there is no
898,I.,"retribution, they have come to believe their own lie. Impiety, then, is"
899,I.,"the chief fact of this speech, which really denies the world-government"
900,I.,and the whole lesson of this poem. Thus the divine warning is
901,I.,"contemned, the call to a change of conduct goes unheeded."
902,I.,
903,I.,3. Then we have the third set of speeches which are personal in their
904,I.,"leading note, and pertain to the absent Ulysses, whose kindness and"
905,I.,"regal character are set forth by Mentor, his old comrade, with strong"
906,I.,reproaches toward the Ithacans for permitting the wrong to his house.
907,I.,It is intimated that they could prevent it if they chose; but they are
908,I.,evidently deaf to this appeal to their gratitude and affection for
909,I.,their chieftain.
910,I.,
911,I.,"Leiocrates, the third Suitor, responds in a speech which is the"
912,I.,culmination of insolence and defiance of right. The Suitors would slay
913,I.,"Ulysses himself, should he now appear and undertake to put them out of"
914,I.,his palace. He dares not come and claim his own! Right or wrong we are
915,I.,"going to stay, and, if necessary, kill the owner. It is the most open"
916,I.,"and complete expression of the spirit of the Suitors, they are a lot of"
917,I.,"brigands, who must be swept away, if there be any order in the world."
918,I.,"Leiocrates dissolves the Assembly, a thing which he evidently had no"
919,I.,"right to do; the people tamely obey, the institutional spirit is not"
920,I.,strong enough to resist the man of violence. Let them scatter; they are
921,I.,a rotten flock of sheep at any rate.
922,I.,
923,I.,Here the first part of the Book concludes. The three sets of speakers
924,I.,"have given their views, one on each side; each set has represented a"
925,I.,"certain phase of the question; thus we have heard the institutional,"
926,I.,religious and personal phases. In such manner the sweep of the conduct
927,I.,of the Suitors is fully brought out; they are destroying State and
928,I.,"Family, are defying the Gods, and are ready to slay the individual who"
929,I.,may stand in their way. Certainly their harvest is ripe for the sickle
930,I.,"of divine justice, upon whose deep foundation this poem reposes."
931,I.,
932,I.,"The Assembly of the People now vanishes quite out of sight, it has"
933,I.,indeed no valid ground of being. The young men seem to be the chief
934,I.,"speakers, and show violent opposition, while the old men hold back, or"
935,I.,manifest open sympathy with the House of Ulysses. The youth of Ithaca
936,I.,"have had their heads turned by the brilliant prize, and rush forward"
937,I.,"forgetful of the penalty. It is indeed a time of moral loosening, of"
938,I.,"which this poem gives the source, progress, and cure. Telemachus,"
939,I.,"however, rises out of the mass of young men, the future hero who is to"
940,I.,assert the law of the Gods. In such manner we are to reach down to the
941,I.,"fact that the spirit of the Odyssey is ethical in the deepest sense,"
942,I.,and reveals unto men the divine order of the world.
943,I.,
944,I.,
945,II.,II.
946,II.,
947,II.,"We now pass to the second part of the book, which shows Telemachus"
948,II.,accomplishing with the aid of the deity what human institutions failed
949,II.,"to do. If the Assembly will not help him in the great cause, the Gods"
950,II.,"will, and now he makes his appeal to them."
951,II.,
952,II.,The Ithacans had refused a ship in order that he might go and learn
953,II.,"something about his father; that is, they will not permit his"
954,II.,"education, which is at present the first object."
955,II.,
956,II.,"He goes down to the seacoast, where he will be alone, communing with"
957,II.,"the Goddess and with himself, and there he prays to Pallas, washing his"
958,II.,"hands in the grey surf--which is, we may well think, a symbolic act of"
959,II.,"purification. Is it a wonder that Pallas, taking the human shape of"
960,II.,"Mentor, comes and speaks to him? She must, if she be at all; he is"
961,II.,"ready, and she has to appear. Her first words are but the echo of his"
962,II.,"conduct all through the preceding scene with the Assembly: ""Telemachus"
963,II.,"henceforth thou shalt be wanting neither in valor nor in wisdom."" She"
964,II.,"rouses him by the fame and deeds of his father, because he is already"
965,II.,aroused. Still she is a very necessary part; she is the divine element
966,II.,in the world speaking to Telemachus and helping him; she shows that his
967,II.,"thought is not merely subjective, but is now one with hers, with"
968,II.,"objective wisdom, and will rule the fact. He ascends into the realm of"
969,II.,"true vision, and from thence organizes his purpose. It is true that the"
970,II.,"poet represents Pallas as ordering the means for the voyage, as at"
971,II.,first she ordered the work of the whole poem. Yet this is also done by
972,II.,Telemachus who has risen to participation in that glance which beholds
973,II.,the truth and controls the world.
974,II.,
975,II.,Often will the foregoing statement be repeated; every divine appearance
976,II.,"in Homer, of any import, is but a repetition of the one fact, which"
977,II.,must always be re-thought by the reader. That which Telemachus says is
978,II.,"no longer his mere wish or opinion, but it is the reality, the valid"
979,II.,"thing outside of him, hence it is voiced by the Goddess, and must take"
980,II.,place. Thus the poet often compels his reader to rise with him into the
981,II.,"sphere of the divine energy, where thinking and willing are one, and"
982,II.,man's insight is just the word of the God.
983,II.,
984,II.,The remaining circumstances of the Book group themselves around the two
985,II.,centers--Telemachus and Pallas--as the Goddess orders them in advance:
986,II.,"""Go thou home and get the stores ready, while I shall engage a ship and"
987,II.,"crew among the Ithacans."""
988,II.,
989,II.,"1. Telemachus goes among the Suitors, evidently to avoid suspicion,"
990,II.,"which his absence might provoke. They taunt and deride him, whereof"
991,II.,"three samples are again given. He goes his way, conscious of his divine"
992,II.,"mission, not failing however to tell them: ""I shall surely make the"
993,II.,"voyage, not in vain it will be."" He obtains food and wine from the aged"
994,II.,"stewardess Eurycleia, who seeks to dissuade him. Then too his mother"
995,II.,"must not know of his plan, she would keep him still a boy in the house,"
996,II.,whereas he has become a man.
997,II.,
998,II.,2. Pallas in the semblance of Telemachus goes through the town to
999,II.,secure the ship and crew. Then she pours over the Suitors a gentle
1000,II.,"sleep after their revel; she takes away their wisdom, yet it is their"
1001,II.,"own deed, which just now has a divine importance. Finally she brings"
1002,II.,"all to the ship, seizes the helm and sends the favoring breeze. Or, as"
1003,II.,"we understand the poet, intelligence brings about these things under"
1004,II.,"many guises; even nature, the breeze, it takes advantage of for its own"
1005,II.,purpose.
1006,II.,
1007,II.,"Thus Pallas has the controlling hand in this second part of the Book,"
1008,II.,she is above man and nature. We can say that the controlling spirit is
1009,II.,"also Telemachus, who manifests Reason, controlling and directing the"
1010,II.,"world. Note the various forms which she assumes, as Mentor, as"
1011,II.,"Telemachus; then again she works purely through mind, in the natural"
1012,II.,"way, as for example, when Telemachus goes home and obtains his food and"
1013,II.,wine for the voyage. The poet thus plays with her shape; still she is
1014,II.,essentially the divine intelligence which seizes upon men and
1015,II.,"circumstances, and fits them into the order universal, and makes them"
1016,II.,contribute to the great purpose of the poem. Still the Goddess does not
1017,II.,"destroy man's freedom, but supplements it, lifting it out of the domain"
1018,II.,of caprice. Telemachus willingly wills the will of Pallas.
1019,II.,
1020,II.,Already it has been remarked that the Goddess is made to command
1021,II.,"nature--the breeze, the sleep of the Suitors. It is the method of fable"
1022,II.,"thus to portray intelligence, whose function is to take control of"
1023,II.,nature and make her subserve its purpose. The breeze blows and drives
1024,II.,"the ship; it is the divine instrument for bringing Telemachus to Pylos,"
1025,II.,"a part of the world-order, especially upon the present occasion. The"
1026,II.,"born poet still talks that way, he is naturally a fabulist and cannot"
1027,II.,"help himself. In his speech, the hunter does not chase the deer, but"
1028,II.,brings it before his gun by a magic power; the mystic fisher calls the
1029,II.,fishes; the enchanted bullet finds its own game and needs only to be
1030,II.,shot off; the tanner even lays a spell upon the water in his vat and
1031,II.,makes it run up hill through a tube bent in a charm. But back of all
1032,II.,"this enchantment intelligence is working and assumes her mythical,"
1033,II.,supernatural garb when the poet images her control of nature.
1034,II.,
1035,II.,"Thus in general the Mythus shadows forth objective mind, not"
1036,II.,"subjective; it springs from the imaginative Reason, and not from a"
1037,II.,cultivated Reflection. In our time the demand is to have these
1038,II.,objective forms translated into subjective thoughts; then we can
1039,II.,understand them better. But the Homeric man shows the opposite
1040,II.,tendency: he had to translate his internal thoughts into the external
1041,II.,shapes of the Mythus before he could grasp fully his own mind. His
1042,II.,conception of the world was mythical; this form he understood and not
1043,II.,"that of abstract reflection. We may well exclaim: Happy Homeric man, to"
1044,II.,"whom the world was ever present, not himself. Yet both sides belong to"
1045,II.,"the full-grown soul, the mythical and the reflective; from Homer the"
1046,II.,"one-sided modern mind can recover a part of its spiritual inheritance,"
1047,II.,which is in danger of being lost.
1048,II.,
1049,II.,"It is therefore, a significant fact that the education of the present"
1050,II.,time is seeking to restore the Mythus to its true place in the
1051,II.,development of human spirit. The Imagination is recognized to have its
1052,II.,"right, and unless it be taken care of in the right way, it will turn a"
1053,II.,"Fury, and wreak treble vengeance upon the age which makes it an"
1054,II.,"outcast. Homer is undoubtedly the greatest of all mythologists, he"
1055,II.,seizes the pure mythical essence of the human mind and gives to it form
1056,II.,"and beauty. Hence from this point of view, specially, we shall study"
1057,II.,him.
1058,II.,
1059,II.,In the present Book the fact is brought out strongly that little or
1060,II.,nothing is to be expected from the Ithacan people toward rectifying the
1061,II.,great wrong done to the House of Ulysses. In part they are the
1062,II.,"wrong-doers themselves, in part they are cowed into inactivity by the"
1063,II.,wrong-doers. Corruption has eaten into the spirit of the people; the
1064,II.,"result is, the great duty of deliverance is thrown back upon an"
1065,II.,"individual. One man is to take the place of all, or a few men the place"
1066,II.,"of the many, for the work must be done. The mightiness of the"
1067,II.,individual in the time of a great crisis is thus set forth in vivid
1068,II.,reality; the one man with the Gods on his side is the majority. With
1069,II.,truest instinct does the old poet show the Goddess Pallas directing
1070,II.,"Telemachus, who participates in the Divine and is carrying out its"
1071,II.,decree. This communion between man and deity is no mere mythologic
1072,II.,"sport, but the sincerest faith; verily it is the solidest fact in the"
1073,II.,"government of the world, and the bard is its voice to all ages."
1074,II.,
1075,II.,This Second Book has its import for the whole poem. It is now manifest
1076,II.,"that Ulysses, when he returns, is not to expect a grand popular"
1077,II.,reception; he must bring himself back to his own by his skill and
1078,II.,prowess alone. The people will not help him slay the wrong-doers;
1079,II.,rather the contrary will happen. Again the individual must work out the
1080,II.,salvation of himself as well as of his family and his country.
1081,II.,Telemachus has shown himself the worthy son of the heroic father; the
1082,II.,"present Book connects him intimately with the return of Ulysses, and"
1083,II.,binds the entire Odyssey into unity; especially does this Book look to
1084,II.,"and prepare for the last twelve Books, which bring father and son"
1085,II.,together in one great act of deliverance.
1086,II.,
1087,II.,"If in the previous Book we beheld the depravity of the Suitors, we now"
1088,II.,witness the imbecility of the People. Still the spark of hope flashes
1089,II.,out brightly in this Ithacan night; something is at work to punish the
1090,II.,guilty and to redeem the land.

1095,_BOOK THIRD._,_BOOK THIRD._
1096,_BOOK THIRD._,
1097,_BOOK THIRD._,
1098,_BOOK THIRD._,"In narrative, the present Book connects directly with the preceding"
1099,_BOOK THIRD._,"Book. Pallas is still with Telemachus, they continue the voyage"
1100,_BOOK THIRD._,"together till they reach Pylos, the home of Nestor. They have left"
1101,_BOOK THIRD._,"Ithaca, and come into another realm; this change of place, as is often"
1102,_BOOK THIRD._,"the case in Homer, carries with it a change of inner condition; the"
1103,_BOOK THIRD._,voyage is not simply geographical but also spiritual; indeed it must be
1104,_BOOK THIRD._,"so, if the young man is to derive from it any experience."
1105,_BOOK THIRD._,
1106,_BOOK THIRD._,Great and striking is the difference between Ithaca and Pylos. The
1107,_BOOK THIRD._,"latter is the abode of religion primarily, the new-comers find the"
1108,_BOOK THIRD._,"Pylians engaged in an act of worship, in which the whole people"
1109,_BOOK THIRD._,"participate, ""nine rows of seats and five hundred men in each row."""
1110,_BOOK THIRD._,
1111,_BOOK THIRD._,"Too large a number, cry some commentators, but they have not looked"
1112,_BOOK THIRD._,"into the real meaning of such a multitude. Here is sacrifice,"
1113,_BOOK THIRD._,"reverence, belief in the Gods; while among the Ithacans is neglect of"
1114,_BOOK THIRD._,"worship, religious paralysis, and downright blasphemy on the part of"
1115,_BOOK THIRD._,"the Suitors. Furthermore, in one country order reigns, in the other is"
1116,_BOOK THIRD._,"anarchy. Such is the contrast between the Second and Third Books, the"
1117,_BOOK THIRD._,contrast between Ithaca and Pylos. We can well think that this contrast
1118,_BOOK THIRD._,"was intended by the poet, and thus we may catch a glimpse of his"
1119,_BOOK THIRD._,artistic procedure.
1120,_BOOK THIRD._,
1121,_BOOK THIRD._,"The center of the picture is Nestor, a very old man, who, accordingly,"
1122,_BOOK THIRD._,gives soul to the Book. He is so near the world of the Gods in the
1123,_BOOK THIRD._,"present life, that he seems already to dwell with them; age brings this"
1124,_BOOK THIRD._,serene piety.
1125,_BOOK THIRD._,
1126,_BOOK THIRD._,No accident is it that this Book of Nestor begins and ends with a
1127,_BOOK THIRD._,festival of sacrifice and prayer; that is the true setting of his
1128,_BOOK THIRD._,character. What he says to the visitors will take color and meaning
1129,_BOOK THIRD._,from his fundamental trait; we may expect in his words a full
1130,_BOOK THIRD._,recognition of divinity in the events of the world.
1131,_BOOK THIRD._,
1132,_BOOK THIRD._,"But he has been a stout fighter in his time, he was in the Trojan War,"
1133,_BOOK THIRD._,"though old already at that period. He will give the lesson of his life,"
1134,_BOOK THIRD._,"not during that war, but afterwards. He was one of the heroes of the"
1135,_BOOK THIRD._,"Iliad, which poem the Odyssey not only does not repeat, but goes out of"
1136,_BOOK THIRD._,its way to avoid any repetition thereof. Moreover he was one of those
1137,_BOOK THIRD._,"who returned home successfully, can he tell how it was done? This is"
1138,_BOOK THIRD._,"the question of special interest to Telemachus, as his father, after"
1139,_BOOK THIRD._,"ten years, has not yet reached home."
1140,_BOOK THIRD._,
1141,_BOOK THIRD._,Herewith the theme of the Book is suggested: the Return. Physically
1142,_BOOK THIRD._,"this was a return from the Trojan War, which is the pre-supposition of"
1143,_BOOK THIRD._,"the whole Odyssey; all the heroes who have not perished, have to get"
1144,_BOOK THIRD._,"back to Hellas in some way. These ways are very diverse, according to"
1145,_BOOK THIRD._,the character of the persons and the circumstances. Thus we touch the
1146,_BOOK THIRD._,"second grand Homeric subject, and, indeed, the second grand fact of the"
1147,_BOOK THIRD._,"Greek consciousness, which lies imbedded in the Return (_Nostos_). A"
1148,_BOOK THIRD._,short survey of this subject must here be given. We have in the present
1149,_BOOK THIRD._,"Book several phases of the Return; Nestor, Menelaus, Ulysses are all"
1150,_BOOK THIRD._,"Returners, to use a necessary word for the thought; each man solves the"
1151,_BOOK THIRD._,problem in his own manner.
1152,_BOOK THIRD._,
1153,_BOOK THIRD._,Now what is this problem? Let us see. The expedition to Troy involved a
1154,_BOOK THIRD._,long separation from home and country on the part of every man who went
1155,_BOOK THIRD._,"with it; still this separation had to be made for the sake of Helen,"
1156,_BOOK THIRD._,"that she, the wife and queen, return to home and country, from which"
1157,_BOOK THIRD._,"she had been taken. Her Return, indeed, is the essence of all their"
1158,_BOOK THIRD._,Returns. We see that through the war they were severed from Family and
1159,_BOOK THIRD._,"State, were compelled to give up for the time being their whole"
1160,_BOOK THIRD._,"institutional life. This long absence deepens into alienation, into a"
1161,_BOOK THIRD._,"spiritual scission, from mere habit in the first place; then, in the"
1162,_BOOK THIRD._,"second place, they are seeking to destroy a home and a country; though"
1163,_BOOK THIRD._,"it be that of the enemy, and the act, even if necessary, brings its"
1164,_BOOK THIRD._,"penalty. It begets a spirit of violence, a disregard of human life, a"
1165,_BOOK THIRD._,destruction of institutional order. Such is the training of the Greeks
1166,_BOOK THIRD._,before Troy. The wanton attack of Ulysses and his companions upon the
1167,_BOOK THIRD._,city of the Ciconians (Book Ninth) is an indication of the spirit
1168,_BOOK THIRD._,"engendered in this long period of violence, among the best and wisest"
1169,_BOOK THIRD._,Greeks.
1170,_BOOK THIRD._,
1171,_BOOK THIRD._,"Still, in spite of the grand estrangement, they have the aspiration for"
1172,_BOOK THIRD._,"return, and for healing the breach which had sunk so deep into their"
1173,_BOOK THIRD._,souls. Did they not undergo all this severing of the dearest ties for
1174,_BOOK THIRD._,"the sake of Helen, for the integrity of the family, and of their civil"
1175,_BOOK THIRD._,"life also? What he has done for Helen, every Greek must be ready to do"
1176,_BOOK THIRD._,"for himself, when the war is over; he must long for the restoration of"
1177,_BOOK THIRD._,the broken relations; he cannot remain in Asia and continue a true
1178,_BOOK THIRD._,"Greek. Such is his conflict; in maintaining Family and State, he has"
1179,_BOOK THIRD._,been forced to sacrifice Family and State. Then when he has
1180,_BOOK THIRD._,"accomplished the deed of sacrifice, he must restore himself to what he"
1181,_BOOK THIRD._,"has immolated. A hard task, a deeply contradictory process, whose end"
1182,_BOOK THIRD._,"is, however, harmony; many will not be able to reach the latter stage,"
1183,_BOOK THIRD._,but will perish by the way. The Return is this great process of
1184,_BOOK THIRD._,restoration after the estrangement.
1185,_BOOK THIRD._,
1186,_BOOK THIRD._,"Many are the Returners, successful and unsuccessful in many different"
1187,_BOOK THIRD._,ways. But they all are resumed in the one long desperate Return of
1188,_BOOK THIRD._,"Ulysses, the wise and much-enduring man. In space as well as in time"
1189,_BOOK THIRD._,his Return is the longest; in spirit it is the deepest and severest by
1190,_BOOK THIRD._,"all odds. The present poem, therefore, is a kind of resumption and"
1191,_BOOK THIRD._,summary of the entire series of Returns (_Nostoi_). In the old Greek
1192,_BOOK THIRD._,"epical ages, the subject gave rise to many poems, which are, however,"
1193,_BOOK THIRD._,"at bottom but one, and this we still possess, while the others are"
1194,_BOOK THIRD._,lost. Spirit takes care of its own verily.
1195,_BOOK THIRD._,
1196,_BOOK THIRD._,"The true Returner, accordingly, gets back to the institutions from"
1197,_BOOK THIRD._,"which he once separated; he knows them now, previously he only felt"
1198,_BOOK THIRD._,them. His institutional world must become thus a conscious possession;
1199,_BOOK THIRD._,"he has gone through the alienation, and has been restored; his"
1200,_BOOK THIRD._,"restoration has been reached through denial, through skepticism, we may"
1201,_BOOK THIRD._,"say, using the modern term. The old unconscious period before the"
1202,_BOOK THIRD._,Trojan war is gone forever; that was the Paradise from which the Greek
1203,_BOOK THIRD._,Adam has been expelled. But the new man after the restoration is the
1204,_BOOK THIRD._,"image of the complete self-conscious being, who has taken the negative"
1205,_BOOK THIRD._,period into himself and digested it. Fortunate person! he cannot now be
1206,_BOOK THIRD._,"made the subject of a poem, for he has no conflict."
1207,_BOOK THIRD._,
1208,_BOOK THIRD._,"But the young man beginning life, the son Telemachus, is to obtain the"
1209,_BOOK THIRD._,"same kind of knowledge, not through experience but through inquiry."
1210,_BOOK THIRD._,Oral tradition is to give him the treasures of wisdom without the
1211,_BOOK THIRD._,bitter personal trial. It is for this reason that Pallas sends him to
1212,_BOOK THIRD._,"find out what his father did, and to make the experience of the parent"
1213,_BOOK THIRD._,"his own by education; it is, indeed, the true education--to master the"
1214,_BOOK THIRD._,accumulated knowledge and wisdom of the race up to date. So we are now
1215,_BOOK THIRD._,"to have the school period of the son, who is thereby not merely the"
1216,_BOOK THIRD._,"physical son (which, he remarks, is always a matter of doubt), but the"
1217,_BOOK THIRD._,"spiritual son of his father, whereof there can be no doubt."
1218,_BOOK THIRD._,
1219,_BOOK THIRD._,"The Odyssey proper, toward which we may now cast a glance, contains the"
1220,_BOOK THIRD._,"wanderings of Ulysses, and is the work of the grown man who has to meet"
1221,_BOOK THIRD._,the world face to face and conquer it; thus he obtains the experience
1222,_BOOK THIRD._,of life. The two parts are always to be placed together--the education
1223,_BOOK THIRD._,of the young man and the experience of the mature man; they constitute
1224,_BOOK THIRD._,"a complete history of a human soul. Both are, indeed one--bud and"
1225,_BOOK THIRD._,"flower; at bottom, too, both mean the same thing--the elevation of the"
1226,_BOOK THIRD._,individual into an ethical life in which he is in harmony with himself
1227,_BOOK THIRD._,and with the divine order. True learning and true experience reach this
1228,_BOOK THIRD._,"end, which may be rightfully called wisdom."
1229,_BOOK THIRD._,
1230,_BOOK THIRD._,So Telemachus the youth is to listen to the great and impressive fact
1231,_BOOK THIRD._,"of his time, containing the deep spiritual problem which is designated"
1232,_BOOK THIRD._,as the Return. Nestor is the first and simplest of these Returners; he
1233,_BOOK THIRD._,"is an old man, he has prudence, he is without passion; moreover he has"
1234,_BOOK THIRD._,not the spirit of inquiry or the searching into the Beyond; he accepts
1235,_BOOK THIRD._,"the transmitted religion and opinions without question, through the"
1236,_BOOK THIRD._,conservatism of age as well as of character. It is clear that the
1237,_BOOK THIRD._,spiritual scission of the time could not enter deep into his nature;
1238,_BOOK THIRD._,his long absence from home and country produced no alienation; he went
1239,_BOOK THIRD._,"home direct after the fall of Troy, the winds and the waters were"
1240,_BOOK THIRD._,"favorable, no tempest, no upheaval, no signs of divine anger. But he"
1241,_BOOK THIRD._,"foresaw the wrath of the Gods and fled across the wave in all speed,"
1242,_BOOK THIRD._,the wrestle with the deity lay not in him.
1243,_BOOK THIRD._,
1244,_BOOK THIRD._,It is worth our while to make a little summary of these Returners in
1245,_BOOK THIRD._,"classes, since in this way the thought of the present Book as well as"
1246,_BOOK THIRD._,its place in the entire Odyssey can be seen best. First are those who
1247,_BOOK THIRD._,"never succeeded in returning, but perished in the process of it; of"
1248,_BOOK THIRD._,"this class the great example is the leader himself, Agamemnon, who was"
1249,_BOOK THIRD._,slain by his own wife and her paramour. Second are those who succeeded
1250,_BOOK THIRD._,"in returning; of this class there are three well-marked divisions,"
1251,_BOOK THIRD._,which are to be sharply designated in the mind of the reader.
1252,_BOOK THIRD._,
1253,_BOOK THIRD._,"(1). The immediate Returners, those who went straight home, without"
1254,_BOOK THIRD._,internal scission or external trouble; unimportant they are in this
1255,_BOOK THIRD._,peaceful aspect though they were formerly heroes in the war. Four such
1256,_BOOK THIRD._,"are passingly mentioned by Nestor in his talk: Diomed, Neoptolemus the"
1257,_BOOK THIRD._,"son of Achilles, Philoctetes, and Idomeneus. Nestor himself is the most"
1258,_BOOK THIRD._,prominent and the typical one of this set who are the Returners through
1259,_BOOK THIRD._,Hellas.
1260,_BOOK THIRD._,
1261,_BOOK THIRD._,(2). The second one of those who have succeeded in getting home is
1262,_BOOK THIRD._,"Menelaus, whose sweep is far beyond that of Nestor and the immediate"
1263,_BOOK THIRD._,"Greek world, taking in Egypt and the East. He was separated from"
1264,_BOOK THIRD._,"Nestor, having delayed to bury his steersman; then a storm struck him,"
1265,_BOOK THIRD._,"bore him to Crete and beyond, the wind and wave carried him to the land"
1266,_BOOK THIRD._,of the Nile. He is the Returner through the Orient.
1267,_BOOK THIRD._,
1268,_BOOK THIRD._,"(3). Finally is Ulysses, not yet returned, but whose time has nearly"
1269,_BOOK THIRD._,arrived. In comparison with the others he is the Returner through the
1270,_BOOK THIRD._,"Occident. But his Return gives name to the poem, of which it is the"
1271,_BOOK THIRD._,greater portion.
1272,_BOOK THIRD._,
1273,_BOOK THIRD._,"Still the universal poem is to embrace all these phases of the Return,"
1274,_BOOK THIRD._,"and the son, through education, is to know them all, not by experience"
1275,_BOOK THIRD._,but by information. Thus his training is to reach beyond what the life
1276,_BOOK THIRD._,"of his father can give him; it must be universal, and in this way it"
1277,_BOOK THIRD._,"becomes a true discipline. We must note too, that this poem reaches"
1278,_BOOK THIRD._,"beyond the Return of Ulysses, beyond what its title suggests, and"
1279,_BOOK THIRD._,"embraces all the Returns, Hellenic, Oriental, Occidental, as well as"
1280,_BOOK THIRD._,the grand failure to return.
1281,_BOOK THIRD._,
1282,_BOOK THIRD._,Such are some of the thoughts which gleam out the present Book and
1283,_BOOK THIRD._,illuminate the whole Odyssey. We can now consider structure of the
1284,_BOOK THIRD._,"Book, which falls into two distinct parts, determined by the Goddess."
1285,_BOOK THIRD._,"When she makes ready to quit Telemachus, we enter the second portion of"
1286,_BOOK THIRD._,"the Book, and Telemachus continues his journey without direct divine"
1287,_BOOK THIRD._,supervision. As the previous Book was marked by the coming of the
1288,_BOOK THIRD._,"Goddess, the present Book is marked by her going. The intercourse of"
1289,_BOOK THIRD._,the youth with Nestor is the extent of her immediate guardianship;
1290,_BOOK THIRD._,"after such an experience, he must learn to make the rest of the journey"
1291,_BOOK THIRD._,through his own resources. Even the deity teaches that there must not
1292,_BOOK THIRD._,be too much reliance upon the deity. The first portion of the Book
1293,_BOOK THIRD._,"extends to line 328, where Nestor ends his story of the Returns and"
1294,_BOOK THIRD._,"suggests the journey to Menelaus for another phase thereof: ""the sun"
1295,_BOOK THIRD._,"set and darkness came on."" The second portion embraces the rest of the"
1296,_BOOK THIRD._,Book. Again we must note that the fundamental Homeric division into the
1297,_BOOK THIRD._,"Upper and Lower Worlds is what divides the Book, thus giving to the"
1298,_BOOK THIRD._,same its organic principle.
1299,_BOOK THIRD._,
1300,_BOOK THIRD._,
1301,I.,I.
1302,I.,
1303,I.,The religious setting of Nestor's world has been noticed already. Into
1304,I.,"it Telemachus comes, out of a realm of violence; it must indicate some"
1305,I.,cure for the ills of Ithaca. But he is now to show himself a man.
1306,I.,"Pallas orders him to put aside his youthful modesty, and boldly make"
1307,I.,the inquiry concerning his father. And here the Goddess utters a remark
1308,I.,"which the student may well ponder: ""Some things thou wilt think of in"
1309,I.,"thine own mind, but a God will suggest others."" Again the Homeric"
1310,I.,dualism--the human and the divine--and also their harmony; the two
1311,I.,elements must come together in every high thought or action. The double
1312,I.,relation of the individual--to himself and to the God--is necessary for
1313,I.,all worthy speech; his own activity and that of the deity run together
1314,I.,in true discourse as well as in true action. So the whole poem is made
1315,I.,up of man's self-determined energy and the interference of the Gods;
1316,I.,yet both are to be seen as ultimately one in the deed.
1317,I.,
1318,I.,"The new-comers are asked to pray, and we hear the famous utterance,"
1319,I.,"which is characteristic of Nestor's world, ""All men have need of the"
1320,I.,"Gods."" This is said by one of his sons. Pallas makes the prayer, a"
1321,I.,"happy one, which brings forth a feeling of harmony between the"
1322,I.,"strangers and all the People. The sympathy is complete, and Telemachus"
1323,I.,"can proceed to ask concerning his father, after he has told who he"
1324,I.,"himself is, and whence he has come. In response, Nestor begins to tell"
1325,I.,the fateful story of the Returns after the fall of Troy. In his
1326,I.,"narrative we behold the starting-point of the calamities, the"
1327,I.,"difference between Agamemnon and Menelaus, followed by a series of"
1328,I.,"separations in succession. ""Zeus planned for them a sad Return,"" which,"
1329,I.,"however, was their own fault, ""for all were neither wise nor just."" It"
1330,I.,"is clear that the Greek unity is utterly broken, a spiritual disruption"
1331,I.,"sets in after the capture of the city. It is, indeed, the new problem,"
1332,I.,this Return to peace and institutional order after ten years' training
1333,I.,"to violence. Such is the penalty of all war, however just and"
1334,I.,"necessary; after it is over, the fighting cannot stop at once, and so"
1335,I.,the victors divide into two camps and continue the fight. Nestor gives
1336,I.,"the picture of these repeated divisions; once, twice, thrice the breach"
1337,I.,"occurs; first he separates from Agamemnon, the second time from"
1338,I.,"Ulysses, the third time from Menelaus. He will go directly home, and"
1339,I.,thus he has to leave the others behind; the scission is not in him as
1340,I.,"in them; he can be restored, in fact he restores himself. He has the"
1341,I.,"instinctive pre-Trojan character still, being an old man; but Ulysses"
1342,I.,"has lost that, and so separates from Nestor, though never before had"
1343,I.,"they differed ""in the Council of the Chiefs or in the Assembly of the"
1344,I.,"People."" But Ulysses has to return by a far different road, and now"
1345,I.,"each of the two wise men takes his own way, though both have to return."
1346,I.,
1347,I.,"Aged Nestor manifestly does not belong to the new epoch, he seems to"
1348,I.,have no sense of the deep spiritual struggle involved. He instinctively
1349,I.,"went home, shunning the conflict; the others could not. In the Iliad"
1350,I.,"the relation between the two wise men, Nestor and Ulysses, is subtly"
1351,I.,"yet clearly drawn; the one--the younger man--has creative intelligence,"
1352,I.,the other--the older man--has appreciative intelligence. In the
1353,I.,"Odyssey, the relation is plainly evolved out of that described in the"
1354,I.,"Iliad; the one is the boundless striver, the other rests in the"
1355,I.,established order of things.
1356,I.,
1357,I.,"Nestor, therefore, cannot tell much about Ulysses, who lies quite out"
1358,I.,"of his horizon, at least in the Odyssey. He can only give hope that the"
1359,I.,"man of wisdom will yet return. This Telemachus doubts, dropping into"
1360,I.,"one of his low human moods, even in the presence of Pallas, who rebukes"
1361,I.,"him sharply. It is, indeed, the great lesson; he must have faith in the"
1362,I.,"reality of the Gods, this is the basis of all his future progress, the"
1363,I.,chief attainment of wisdom. The young man must not fall away into
1364,I.,"denial, he must be taught that there is a divine order in the world."
1365,I.,"Old Homer, too, had his notions about religion in education, and the"
1366,I.,Goddess herself is here introduced giving a lesson.
1367,I.,
1368,I.,"Nestor, though unable himself to give much information about the"
1369,I.,"Return, can point to the second grand Returner, Menelaus, who has"
1370,I.,"lately come from a distant land, and may have something to say. In fact"
1371,I.,"Menelaus was the last to separate from Nestor, Ulysses had separated"
1372,I.,long before.
1373,I.,
1374,I.,"One other story Nestor tells with great sympathy, that of Agamemnon,"
1375,I.,who represents a still different form of the Return. The great leader
1376,I.,"of the Greeks can master the Trojan difficulty, can even get back to"
1377,I.,"home and country, but these are ultimately lost to him by his faithless"
1378,I.,"spouse. Still, after the father's death, the son Orestes restores"
1379,I.,"Family and State. Therein Telemachus sees an image of himself, the son,"
1380,I.,"who is to slay his mother's suitors; he sees, too, the possible fate of"
1381,I.,"his father. Ulysses has essentially the same problem as Agamemnon,"
1382,I.,though he has not the faithless wife in addition; Telemachus beholds
1383,I.,"his duty in the deed of Orestes, according to Greek consciousness. We"
1384,I.,shall see hereafter how Ulysses takes due precaution not to be slain in
1385,I.,"his own land, as Agamemnon was. In disguise he will go to his own"
1386,I.,"palace and carefully note the situation in advance, and then strike the"
1387,I.,blow of deliverance.
1388,I.,
1389,I.,Several times Homer repeats in the Odyssey the tragic story of
1390,I.,"Agamemnon, the great Leader of the Greeks at Troy. An awe-inspiring"
1391,I.,"tale of destiny; out of it Æschylus will develop his great tragedy, the"
1392,I.,Oresteia. Indeed the epos develops into tragedy with the full mythical
1393,I.,unfolding of this story. Æschylus will deepen the motives into internal
1394,I.,"collisions; he will show the right and the wrong in Agamemnon, and even"
1395,I.,"in Clytemnestra. Orestes, however beneficent his deed in avenging his"
1396,I.,"father, will not escape the counterstroke; Æschylus will send after him"
1397,I.,the Furies for the guilt of having murdered his mother. Thus the double
1398,I.,"nature of the deed, its reward and its penalty, unfolds out of Homer"
1399,I.,"into Æschylus, and creates the Greek drama as we know it at present."
1400,I.,
1401,I.,Nestor has now told what lay in the immediate circle of his experience:
1402,I.,the Return direct through Hellas. Again he mentions the last
1403,I.,"separation; it was that of himself from Menelaus, when the latter was"
1404,I.,"swept beyond the limit of Hellas into Egypt, from which he has now"
1405,I.,returned. What next? Evidently the young man must be sent to him at
1406,I.,"Sparta in order to share in this larger circle of experience, extending"
1407,I.,"to the Orient. So Greece points to the East in many ways; Nestor, the"
1408,I.,"purely Hellenic soul, knows of that wider knowledge, though it be not"
1409,I.,"his, and he knows that it should be possessed."
1410,I.,
1411,I.,In this Book as elsewhere in the Odyssey the grand background is the
1412,I.,"Trojan war. The incidents of the Iliad are hardly alluded to, but are"
1413,I.,"certainly taken for granted; the Post-Iliad is the field of interest,"
1414,I.,for in it the Returns take place. Thus the two great poems of Homer
1415,I.,join together and show themselves as complements of each other.
1416,I.,
1417,I.,
1418,II.,II.
1419,II.,
1420,II.,Now comes the separation which marks the second portion of the Book.
1421,II.,"Pallas, in the guise of Mentor, coincides with Nestor in advising"
1422,II.,"Telemachus to pay a visit to Menelaus, and then she departs, ""sailing"
1423,II.,"off like a sea-eagle,"" whereat great astonishment from all present."
1424,II.,"That is, she reveals herself; all recognize the Goddess, and probably"
1425,II.,that is the reason why she can no longer stay. She has become internal.
1426,II.,"Telemachus is now conscious, as she disappears, and he has his own"
1427,II.,"wisdom; he has seen Pallas, and so he must go without her to Sparta."
1428,II.,"Hardly does he need her longer, being started upon the path of wisdom"
1429,II.,"to know wisdom. At the court of Nestor, with its deeply religious"
1430,II.,"atmosphere, she can appear; but she declines to go with him in person"
1431,II.,"to Menelaus, though she advises the journey. All of which, to the"
1432,II.,"sympathetic reader, has its significance. Still Pallas has by no means"
1433,II.,"vanished out of the career of Telemachus; she at present, however,"
1434,II.,"leaves him to himself, as she often does."
1435,II.,
1436,II.,"Nestor, too, responds to the marvelous incident in true accord with his"
1437,II.,"character; he invokes her with prayer and institutes a grand sacrifice,"
1438,II.,which is now described in a good deal of detail. Just as the Book opens
1439,II.,"with a sacrifice to a deity, so it closes with one--the two form the"
1440,II.,setting of the whole description. Thus the recognition of the Gods is
1441,II.,"everywhere set forth in Nestor's world; he is the man of faith, of"
1442,II.,"primitive, immediate faith, which has never felt the doubt."
1443,II.,
1444,II.,"It is well that Telemachus meets with such a man at the start, and gets"
1445,II.,a breath out of such an atmosphere. He has seen the ills of Ithaca from
1446,II.,his boyhood; he may well question at times the superintendence of the
1447,II.,Gods. His own experience of life would lead him to doubt the existence
1448,II.,of a Divine Order. Even here in Pylos he challenges the supremacy of
1449,II.,the Olympians. When Nestor intimates that his father will yet return
1450,II.,"and punish the Suitors, with the help of Pallas, or that he himself may"
1451,II.,"possibly do so with the aid of the same Goddess, Telemachus replies:"
1452,II.,"""Never will that come to pass, I think, though I hope for it; no, not"
1453,II.,"even if the Gods should so will."" Assuredly a young skeptic he shows"
1454,II.,"himself, probably in a fit of despondency; sharp is the reproof of the"
1455,II.,"Goddess: ""O Telemachus, what kind of talk is that? Easily can a God, if"
1456,II.,"he wills it, save a man even at a distance."" Thus she, a Goddess,"
1457,II.,"asserts the supremacy of the Gods, even though they cannot avert death."
1458,II.,"But the youth persists at present: ""let us talk no more of this; my"
1459,II.,"father never will return."" But when Nestor has told the story of"
1460,II.,"Ægisthus punished by the son Orestes, the impression is strong that"
1461,II.,there is a divine justice which overtakes the guilty man at last; such
1462,II.,is the old man's lesson to the juvenile doubter. The lesson is imparted
1463,II.,"in the form of a tale, but it has its meaning, and Telemachus cannot"
1464,II.,help putting himself into the place of Orestes.
1465,II.,
1466,II.,"Such is, then, the training which the young man, shaken by misfortune,"
1467,II.,obtains at the court of Nestor; the training to a belief in the rule of
1468,II.,the Gods in a Divine Order of the World--which is the fundamental
1469,II.,belief of the present poem. It is no wonder that Telemachus sees Pallas
1470,II.,"at last, sees that she has been with him, recognizing her presence. To"
1471,II.,"be sure, she now disappears as a personal presence, having been found"
1472,II.,out; still she sends Telemachus on his journey to Sparta. Thus the
1473,II.,"Third Book has a distinctive character of its own, differing decidedly"
1474,II.,from the Book which goes before and from that which follows. Here is a
1475,II.,"religious world, idyllic, paradisaical in its immediate relation to the"
1476,II.,"Gods, and in the primitive innocence of its people, who seem to be"
1477,II.,without a jar or inner scission. No doubt or dissonance has yet entered
1478,II.,"apparently; Pylos stands between Ithaca, the land of absolute discord,"
1479,II.,"and Sparta, the land recently restored out of discord. The Book hears a"
1480,II.,"relation to the whole Odyssey in its special theme, which is the"
1481,II.,"Return, of which it represents in the ruler Nestor a particular phase."
1482,II.,"It prepares the way for the grand Return, which is that of Ulysses; it"
1483,II.,is a link connecting the whole poem into unity. Moreover it shadows
1484,II.,"forth one of the movements of Greek spirit, which seized upon this idea"
1485,II.,of a Return from Troy to express the soul's restoration from its
1486,II.,"warring, alienated, dualistic condition. It is well known that there"
1487,II.,were many poems on this subject; each hero along with his town or land
1488,II.,"had his Return, which became embodied in legend and song. All Hellas,"
1489,II.,"in a certain stage of its spiritual movement, had a tendency to break"
1490,II.,"out into the lay of the Return. One of the so-called cyclic poets,"
1491,II.,"Hagias of Troezen, collected a number of these lays into one poem and"
1492,II.,"called it the _Nostoi_ or Returns, evidently an outgrowth of this Third"
1493,II.,Book in particular and of the Odyssey in general.
1494,II.,
1495,II.,Thus Telemachus has witnessed and heard a good deal during his stay
1496,II.,"with Nestor. He has seen a religious world, a realm of faith in the"
1497,II.,"Gods, which certainly has left its strong impression; he has been"
1498,II.,"inspired by the example of his father, whose worth has been set forth,"
1499,II.,"and whose place in the great Trojan movement has been indicated, by the"
1500,II.,"aged Hero. Still further, Telemachus has been brought to share in the"
1501,II.,"idea of the Return, the present underlying idea of the whole Greek"
1502,II.,"consciousness; thus he must be led to believe in it and to work for it,"
1503,II.,"applying it to his own case and his own land. Largely, from a negative,"
1504,II.,"despairing state of mind due to his Ithacan environment, he has been"
1505,II.,led into glimpses of a positive believing one; this has sprung from his
1506,II.,"schooling with Nestor, who may be called his first schoolmaster, from"
1507,II.,whom he is now to pass to his second.
1508,II.,
1509,II.,The reader must judge whether the preceding view be too introspective
1510,II.,"for Homer, who is usually declared to be the unconscious poet, quite"
1511,II.,unaware of his purpose or process. No one can carefully read the Third
1512,II.,Book without feeling its religious purport; an atmosphere it has
1513,II.,peculiar to itself in relation to the other Books of the Telemachiad.
1514,II.,"To be sure, we can read it as an adventure, a mere diverting story,"
1515,II.,without further meaning than the attempt to entertain vacant heads
1516,II.,seeking to kill time. But really it is the record of the spirit's
1517,II.,"experience, and must so be interpreted. Again the question comes up:"
1518,II.,"what is it to know Homer? His geography, his incidents, his grammar,"
1519,II.,his entire outer world have their right and must be studied--but let us
1520,II.,proceed to the next Book.
1521,II.,
1522,II.,
1523,II.,
1524,II.,
1525,_BOOK FOURTH._,_BOOK FOURTH._
1526,_BOOK FOURTH._,
1527,_BOOK FOURTH._,
1528,_BOOK FOURTH._,The transition from Book Third to Book Fourth involves a very
1529,_BOOK FOURTH._,"significant change of environment. In Sparta, to which Telemachus now"
1530,_BOOK FOURTH._,"passes, there is occurring no public sacrifice to the Gods, but a"
1531,_BOOK FOURTH._,domestic festal occasion gives the tone; he moves out of a religious
1532,_BOOK FOURTH._,"into a secular atmosphere. Pylos allows the simple state of faith, the"
1533,_BOOK FOURTH._,"world unfallen; Sparta has in it the deep scission of the soul, which,"
1534,_BOOK FOURTH._,"however, is at present healed after many wanderings and struggles."
1535,_BOOK FOURTH._,"Nestor, as we have seen, is quite without inner conflict; Menelaus and"
1536,_BOOK FOURTH._,"Helen represent a long, long training in the school of error,"
1537,_BOOK FOURTH._,"tribulation, misfortune. Pylos is the peace before the fall, Sparta is"
1538,_BOOK FOURTH._,"the peace after the fall, yet with many reminiscences of the latter."
1539,_BOOK FOURTH._,"This Fourth Book reaches out beyond Greece, beyond the Trojan War, it"
1540,_BOOK FOURTH._,"goes beyond the Hellenic limit in Space and Time, it sweeps backward"
1541,_BOOK FOURTH._,"into Egypt and the Orient. It is a marvelous Book, calling for our best"
1542,_BOOK FOURTH._,study and reflection; certainly it is one of the greatest compositions
1543,_BOOK FOURTH._,of the human mind. Its fundamental note is restoration after the grand
1544,_BOOK FOURTH._,"lapse; witness Helen, and Menelaus too; the Third Book has no"
1545,_BOOK FOURTH._,"restoration, because it has no alienation."
1546,_BOOK FOURTH._,
1547,_BOOK FOURTH._,The account of the various Returns from Troy is continued. In the
1548,_BOOK FOURTH._,"preceding Book we had those given by Nestor, specially his own, which"
1549,_BOOK FOURTH._,"was without conflict. He is the man of age and wisdom, he does not fall"
1550,_BOOK FOURTH._,"out with the Gods, he does not try to transcend the prescribed limits,"
1551,_BOOK FOURTH._,he is old and conservative. The Returns which he speaks of beside his
1552,_BOOK FOURTH._,"own, are confined to the Greek world; that was the range of his vision."
1553,_BOOK FOURTH._,
1554,_BOOK FOURTH._,"But now in the Fourth Book we are to hear of the second great Return,"
1555,_BOOK FOURTH._,"in which two Greeks participate, Menelaus and Helen. This Return is by"
1556,_BOOK FOURTH._,"way of the East, through Egypt, which is the land of ancient wisdom for"
1557,_BOOK FOURTH._,"the Greek man, and for us too. It is the land of the past to the"
1558,_BOOK FOURTH._,"Hellenic mind, whither the person who aspires to know the antecedents"
1559,_BOOK FOURTH._,"of himself and his culture must travel; or, he must learn of those who"
1560,_BOOK FOURTH._,"have been there, if he cannot go himself. Egyptian lore, which had a"
1561,_BOOK FOURTH._,"great influence upon the early Greek world in its formative period,"
1562,_BOOK FOURTH._,must have some reflection in this primitive Greek book of education. So
1563,_BOOK FOURTH._,"Telemachus, to complete his discipline, must reach beyond Greece into"
1564,_BOOK FOURTH._,"the Orient, he must get far back of Troy, which was merely an"
1565,_BOOK FOURTH._,orientalizing Hellenic city; he must learn of Egypt. Thus he transcends
1566,_BOOK FOURTH._,"the national limit, and begins to obtain an universal culture."
1567,_BOOK FOURTH._,
1568,_BOOK FOURTH._,But the moment we go beyond the Greek world with its clear plastic
1569,_BOOK FOURTH._,"outlines, the artistic form changes; the Hellenic sunshine is tinged"
1570,_BOOK FOURTH._,with Oriental shadows; we pass from the unveiled Zeus to the veiled
1571,_BOOK FOURTH._,Isis. Homer himself gets colored with touches of Oriental mystery. The
1572,_BOOK FOURTH._,"Egyptian part of this Fourth Book, therefore, will show a"
1573,_BOOK FOURTH._,"transformation of style as well as of thought, and changeful Proteus"
1574,_BOOK FOURTH._,will become a true image of the Poet. The work will manifest a symbolic
1575,_BOOK FOURTH._,"tendency; it will have an aroma of the wisdom of the East, taught in"
1576,_BOOK FOURTH._,"forms of the parable, the apologue, with hints of allegory. The world,"
1577,_BOOK FOURTH._,"thrown outside of that transparent Greek life, becomes a Fairy Tale,"
1578,_BOOK FOURTH._,which is here taken up and incorporated into a great poem. We shall be
1579,_BOOK FOURTH._,"compelled to look thoroughly into these strange shapes of Egypt, and,"
1580,_BOOK FOURTH._,"if possible, reach down to their meaning, for meaning they must have,"
1581,_BOOK FOURTH._,or be meaningless. We shall find that this Fourth Book stands in the
1582,_BOOK FOURTH._,"front rank of Homeric poetry for depth and suggestiveness, if not for"
1583,_BOOK FOURTH._,epical lucidity.
1584,_BOOK FOURTH._,
1585,_BOOK FOURTH._,"What did not Telemachus see and hear at Sparta? That was, indeed, an"
1586,_BOOK FOURTH._,"education. He saw the two great returned ones, the woman and the man."
1587,_BOOK FOURTH._,"Helen he saw, who had passed through her long alienation and was now"
1588,_BOOK FOURTH._,"restored to home and country after the Trojan discipline. In her, the"
1589,_BOOK FOURTH._,"most beautiful woman, the human cycle was complete--the fall, the"
1590,_BOOK FOURTH._,"repentance, the restoration. Then the eager youth saw Menelaus, and"
1591,_BOOK FOURTH._,heard his story of the Return; he is the man who seeks the treasures of
1592,_BOOK FOURTH._,"the East, and brings them to Hellas in the Hellenic way. He finds them,"
1593,_BOOK FOURTH._,"too, after much suffering, never losing them again in the tempests of"
1594,_BOOK FOURTH._,"his voyage, for does he not spread them out before us in his talk? Both"
1595,_BOOK FOURTH._,"the man and the woman, after the greatest human trials, have reached"
1596,_BOOK FOURTH._,serenity--an institutional and an intellectual harmony. The young man
1597,_BOOK FOURTH._,sees it and feels it and takes it away in his head and heart.
1598,_BOOK FOURTH._,
1599,_BOOK FOURTH._,The present Book falls easily into two distinct portions. The first is
1600,_BOOK FOURTH._,the visit of Telemachus to Sparta and what he experiences there. Sparta
1601,_BOOK FOURTH._,is at peace and in order; the youth to a degree beholds in it the ideal
1602,_BOOK FOURTH._,land to which he must help transform his own disordered country. The
1603,_BOOK FOURTH._,second portion of the Book goes back to Ithaca (line 625 of the Greek
1604,_BOOK FOURTH._,text). Here we are suddenly plunged again into the wrongful deeds of
1605,_BOOK FOURTH._,"the suitors, done to the House of Ulysses. They are plotting the death"
1606,_BOOK FOURTH._,"of Telemachus, the bearing of whose new career has dawned upon them."
1607,_BOOK FOURTH._,Ithaca is truly the realm of discord in contrast to the harmony of
1608,_BOOK FOURTH._,"Sparta and the House of Menelaus, which has also had sore trials. Hence"
1609,_BOOK FOURTH._,Sparta may be considered a prophecy of the redemption of Ithaca.
1610,_BOOK FOURTH._,
1611,_BOOK FOURTH._,"Following out these structural suggestions, we designate the organism"
1612,_BOOK FOURTH._,of the Book in this manner:--
1613,_BOOK FOURTH._,
1614,_BOOK FOURTH._,I. The visit of Telemachus at Sparta in which he beholds and converses
1615,_BOOK FOURTH._,"with two chief Returners from Troy, those who came back by way of the"
1616,_BOOK FOURTH._,"East, Menelaus and Helen. This part embraces the greater portion of the"
1617,_BOOK FOURTH._,Book and falls into three divisions.
1618,_BOOK FOURTH._,
1619,_BOOK FOURTH._,1. The arrival and recognition of the son of Ulysses by Menelaus and
1620,_BOOK FOURTH._,"Helen who are in a mood of reminiscence, speaking of and in the Present"
1621,_BOOK FOURTH._,"with many a glance back into the Past. The Oriental journey to Cyprus,"
1622,_BOOK FOURTH._,"Phoenicia, and specially Egypt, plays into their conversation, making"
1623,_BOOK FOURTH._,the whole a Domestic Tale of real life with an ideal background lying
1624,_BOOK FOURTH._,beyond Hellas.
1625,_BOOK FOURTH._,
1626,_BOOK FOURTH._,"2. When the son is duly recognized and received, the father Ulysses"
1627,_BOOK FOURTH._,comes in for reminiscence; with him the background shifts from the
1628,_BOOK FOURTH._,"Orient to Troy, where he was the hero of so many deeds of cunning and"
1629,_BOOK FOURTH._,"valor, and where both Menelaus and Helen were chief actors. The"
1630,_BOOK FOURTH._,literary form passes out of the Domestic Tale of the Present into the
1631,_BOOK FOURTH._,"Heroic Tale of the Past, from sorrowful retrospection to bracing"
1632,_BOOK FOURTH._,"description of daring deeds. Helen and Menelaus, each in turn, tell"
1633,_BOOK FOURTH._,"stories of Ulysses at Troy to the son, who thus learns much about his"
1634,_BOOK FOURTH._,"father. As already said, the background of this portion is the Trojan"
1635,_BOOK FOURTH._,"war which was the grand Hellenic separation from the Orient. The Iliad,"
1636,_BOOK FOURTH._,and specially the Post-Iliad are here presupposed by the Odyssey.
1637,_BOOK FOURTH._,
1638,_BOOK FOURTH._,"3. The Return of Menelaus is now told to Telemachus, which Return"
1639,_BOOK FOURTH._,reaches behind the Trojan war into the East and beyond the limits of
1640,_BOOK FOURTH._,the real Hellas into Egypt. Thus the spatial and temporal bounds of
1641,_BOOK FOURTH._,"Greece are transcended, the actual both in the Present and Past goes"
1642,_BOOK FOURTH._,"over into the purely ideal, and the literary form becomes a Marvelous"
1643,_BOOK FOURTH._,"Tale--that of Proteus, which suggests not only Present and Past, but"
1644,_BOOK FOURTH._,all Time.
1645,_BOOK FOURTH._,
1646,_BOOK FOURTH._,II. Such is the grand Return of Menelaus out of struggle and dualism
1647,_BOOK FOURTH._,"into peace and reconciliation with himself and the world, barring"
1648,_BOOK FOURTH._,"certain painful memories. The poet next, in sharp contrast throws the"
1649,_BOOK FOURTH._,"reader back to Ithaca, the land of strife and wrong, in general of"
1650,_BOOK FOURTH._,"limits for young Telemachus, who is reaching out for freedom through"
1651,_BOOK FOURTH._,"intelligence, and is getting a good deal thereof. Two phases:"
1652,_BOOK FOURTH._,
1653,_BOOK FOURTH._,"1. The Suitors' limits, which he has broken through; their wrath and"
1654,_BOOK FOURTH._,their plan of murdering him in consequence.
1655,_BOOK FOURTH._,
1656,_BOOK FOURTH._,"2. The mother's limits, which he has also broken through; her paroxysm"
1657,_BOOK FOURTH._,"in consequence, and final consolation."
1658,_BOOK FOURTH._,
1659,_BOOK FOURTH._,
1660,I.,I.
1661,I.,
1662,I.,"The first portion of the Book, as above given, is by all means the"
1663,I.,greatest in conception and in execution as well as the longest. As
1664,I.,"already indicated there are three kinds of writing in it, yet fused"
1665,I.,"together into unity, which makes it a most varied, yet profoundly"
1666,I.,"suggestive piece of Art. The simple idyllic, domestic strain of"
1667,I.,ordinary real life we hear at the start in the reception and
1668,I.,recognition of Telemachus at Sparta; the scene lies in the sunshine of
1669,I.,"a serene existence, yet after mighty tempests. Thence we pass into the"
1670,I.,"heroic world of Troy out of Greece and the Present, and listen to an"
1671,I.,"epical story of heroism told by Menelaus and Helen, of the Hero"
1672,I.,"Ulysses; finally we are brought to Egypt, and hear a prophecy"
1673,I.,"concerning the same Hero, who is now the subject of the Fairy Tale. In"
1674,I.,"other words, in this portion of the Fourth Book we observe a change of"
1675,I.,"scene to three localities--Greece, Troy, Egypt, which correspond to"
1676,I.,"Present, Past, and Future, and which attune the soul respectively to"
1677,I.,"Sorrow, Reminiscence, Prophecy. In accord with this variety of place"
1678,I.,and circumstance is the variety of literary form already noted: the
1679,I.,"ordinary Descriptive Tale of the Present, the Heroic Story of the Past,"
1680,I.,and the Fairy Tale imaging what is distant in space and time.
1681,I.,
1682,I.,"1. As Telemachus arrives, he notes the outer setting to this noble"
1683,I.,picture of Menelaus and Helen. There is the magnificent palace with
1684,I.,"many costly ornaments of ""bronze, gold, silver, amber and ivory;"" it"
1685,I.,"has the ideal of Greek architecture, not yet realized doubtless, still"
1686,I.,"it suggests ""the Hall of Olympian Zeus"" to the admiring Telemachus. The"
1687,I.,"new-comers happen upon a wedding-festival, which connects the place and"
1688,I.,"the occasion with the Trojan war and its Hero Achilles, whose son is"
1689,I.,"now to marry Helen's daughter, betrothed to him while at Troy. Moreover"
1690,I.,"it is a time of joy, which brings all before us at first in a festal"
1691,I.,mood.
1692,I.,
1693,I.,Nor must we pass by that astonishing utterance of Menelaus to his
1694,I.,"servant who proposed to turn away the guests: ""Thou prattlest silly"
1695,I.,"things like a child, verily have we come hither partaking of the"
1696,I.,"hospitable fare of other men."" Therefore we ought to give that which we"
1697,I.,have received. One likes to note these touches of humanity in the old
1698,I.,heathen Greek; he too knew and applied the Golden Rule. The wisdom of
1699,I.,life here peers forth in the much-traveled Menelaus; suffering has
1700,I.,"taught him to consider others; sorrow he has experienced, but it has"
1701,I.,brought its best reward--compassion. This sorrow at once breaks forth
1702,I.,in response to the admiration of Telemachus for the outward splendor of
1703,I.,his palace and possessions.
1704,I.,
1705,I.,The Spartan king takes a short retrospect of life as it has been
1706,I.,allotted him; the sighs well out between his words as he tells his
1707,I.,story. Eight years he wandered after the taking of Troy; for he passed
1708,I.,"across the sea, to Egypt, even to Æthiopia and Lybia, which he portrays"
1709,I.,"as a wonderland of golden plenty. But while he was gone, ""gathering"
1710,I.,"much wealth,"" his brother Agamemnon was slain; ""therefore, small joy I"
1711,I.,"have bearing rule over these possessions."" But chiefly he laments the"
1712,I.,"loss of one man, on account of whom ""sleep and food become hateful to"
1713,I.,"me when I think upon him."" That man is Ulysses, who has suffered more"
1714,I.,than any other Greek. Thus a strong deep stream of sympathy breaks
1715,I.,"forth from the heart of Menelaus, and the son, hearing his father's"
1716,I.,"name, holds up the purple mantle before his eyes, shedding the tear. A"
1717,I.,strong unconscious bond of feeling at once unites both.
1718,I.,
1719,I.,How can we fail to notice the clear indication of purpose in these
1720,I.,"passages! The Poet brings Menelaus, as the culmination of his story, to"
1721,I.,strike the chord which stirs most profoundly the soul of Telemachus.
1722,I.,The son is there to inquire concerning his father; without revealing
1723,I.,himself he learns much about the character and significance of his
1724,I.,"parent. The same artistic forethought is shown, when, at this sad"
1725,I.,"moment, Helen enters, the primal source of all these calamities, in a"
1726,I.,"glorious manifestation of her beauty. Telemachus sees or may see,"
1727,I.,"embodied in her the very essence of Greek spirit, that which had to be"
1728,I.,"restored to Hellas from Asia, if Hellas was to exist. The Poet likens"
1729,I.,"her to a Goddess, and places her in surroundings which are to set off"
1730,I.,"her divine appearance. In her case, too, we notice the distant"
1731,I.,"background: Egyptian presents she has, as well as Menelaus, ""a golden"
1732,I.,"distaff and a silver basket bound in gold."" Mementos from far-off"
1733,I.,wonderland are woven into the speech and character of the famous pair.
1734,I.,
1735,I.,Now for a true female trait. Helen at once recognizes the young
1736,I.,"stranger as the son of Ulysses, wherein she stands in contrast to her"
1737,I.,"husband Menelaus, who, in spite of his thinking about his friend just"
1738,I.,"at that moment, had failed to see before him the son of that friend."
1739,I.,But no sooner had the woman laid eyes upon Telemachus than she
1740,I.,personally identified him. When the wife had spoken the words of
1741,I.,"immediate insight and instinct, the wise husband sees the truth and"
1742,I.,"gives his reasons. When the fact has been told him, he can easily prove"
1743,I.,it.
1744,I.,
1745,I.,Supremely beautiful is this appearance of Helen in the Odyssey; she is
1746,I.,the completion of what we saw and knew of her in the Iliad. Now she is
1747,I.,"restored to home and country, after her long alienation; still she has"
1748,I.,lurking moments of self-reproach on account of her former deeds. Though
1749,I.,"she has repented and has been received back, she cannot forget, ought"
1750,I.,not to forget the past altogether. The conduct of the husband is most
1751,I.,"noble in these scenes; he has forgiven her fully, never upbraiding,"
1752,I.,"never even alluding to her fatal act, excepting in one passage"
1753,I.,"possibly, in which there is a gentle palliation of her behavior: ""Thou"
1754,I.,"camest to the place, moved by some divinity who wished to give glory to"
1755,I.,"the Trojans."" The husband will not blame her, she acted under the"
1756,I.,stimulus of a God. The fallen woman restored is the divinest of all
1757,I.,pictures; we wonder again at the far-reaching humanity of the old bard;
1758,I.,to-day she would hardly be taken back and forgiven by the world as
1759,I.,"completely as she is in the pages of Homer. She is indeed a new Helen,"
1760,I.,standing forth in the purest radiance within the shining palace of
1761,I.,Menelaus. Long shall the world continue to gaze at her there.
1762,I.,
1763,I.,"Telemachus is to see and to hear Helen; that is, indeed, one of his"
1764,I.,supreme experiences. But it is not here a matter of superficial staring
1765,I.,"at a beautiful woman; all that Helen is, the total cycle of her"
1766,I.,"spirit's history, is to enter his heart and become a vital portion of"
1767,I.,his discipline. It is probable that the youth does not realize every
1768,I.,"thing that Helen means and is; still he beholds her, and that in itself"
1769,I.,"is an education. Helen is not merely a figure of voluptuous beauty,"
1770,I.,which captivates the senses; she bears in her the experience of
1771,I.,"complete humanity; she has erred, she has transformed her error, she"
1772,I.,has been restored to that ethical order which she had violated. All of
1773,I.,"which the young man is to see written in her face, and to feel in her"
1774,I.,"words and conduct, though he may not consciously formulate it in his"
1775,I.,"thought. This is the true beauty of Helen, not simply the outer"
1776,I.,"sensuous form, though she possesses that too. She could not be the"
1777,I.,"ideal of the Greek world, if she were merely an Oriental enchantress;"
1778,I.,indeed it is just the function of the Greeks to rescue her from such a
1779,I.,"condition, which was that of Helen in Troy."
1780,I.,
1781,I.,Already the heart of Menelaus is full at the thought of his friend
1782,I.,"Ulysses, and he warms toward the latter's son now present. He again"
1783,I.,utters words of sympathetic sorrow. All are touched; all have lost some
1784,I.,dear relative at Troy; it is a moment of overpowering emotion. The four
1785,I.,people weep in common; it is but an outburst; they rally from their
1786,I.,"sorrow, Menelaus commands: ""Let us cease from mourning and think of the"
1787,I.,"feast."""
1788,I.,
1789,I.,It is at this point that Helen again interposes. Her experience of life
1790,I.,"has been the deepest, saddest, most complete of all, she has mastered"
1791,I.,"her conflicts, inner and outer, and reached the haven of serenity; she"
1792,I.,can point out the way of consolation. In fact it is her supreme
1793,I.,"function to show to others what she has gone through, and thereby save"
1794,I.,"them, in part at least, the arduous way. For is not the career of every"
1795,I.,"true hero or heroine vicarious to a certain degree? Assuredly, if they"
1796,I.,mean any thing to the sons and daughters of men. Helen can bring the
1797,I.,"relief, and does so in the present instance."
1798,I.,
1799,I.,"She fetches forth that famous drug, the grand antidote for grief and"
1800,I.,"passion, and all life's ills, the true solacer in life's journey. It"
1801,I.,"had been given her by an Egyptian woman, Polydamna, whom she had met in"
1802,I.,"her wanderings, and it had evidently helped to cure her lacerated soul."
1803,I.,"Again Egypt lies in the background, as it does everywhere in this Book,"
1804,I.,"the veritable wonderland, from which many miraculous blessings are"
1805,I.,"sent. Moreover it is the land of potent drugs, ""some beneficial and"
1806,I.,"some baneful;"" its physicians too, are celebrated as excelling all men."
1807,I.,Still more curious is the fact that women possess the secret of
1808,I.,"medicine as well as men, and Polydamna may be set down as the first"
1809,I.,female doctor--she who gave the wonderful drug to Helen. Surely there
1810,I.,is nothing new under the sun.
1811,I.,
1812,I.,"This marvelous drug, often called Nepenthe from one of its attributes,"
1813,I.,has naturally aroused much curiosity among the many-minded readers of
1814,I.,"Homer down the ages. Some have held that it was an herb, which they"
1815,I.,have pointed out in the valley of the Nile. Others hold it to be opium
1816,I.,"literally, though it does not here put to sleep or silence the company."
1817,I.,On the other hand allegory has tried its hand at the word. Certain
1818,I.,ancients including Plutarch found in it an emblem hinting the charm of
1819,I.,pleasing narrative. As Helen at once passes to story-telling about
1820,I.,"Ulysses at Troy, changing from sad reminiscences of the dead to"
1821,I.,"stirring deeds of living men, we may suppose that this has something to"
1822,I.,"do with her Nepenthe, which changes the mind from inward to outward,"
1823,I.,from emotion to action. The magic charm seems to work potently when she
1824,I.,"begins to talk. Through her, the artist as well as the ideal, we make"
1825,I.,"the transition into the Heroic Tale of the olden time, of which she"
1826,I.,gives a specimen.
1827,I.,
1828,I.,"2. Very naturally the Trojan scene is next taken, that greatest deed of"
1829,I.,"the Greek race, being that which really made it a new race, separating"
1830,I.,it from the Orient and giving it a new destiny. Helen now tells to the
1831,I.,"company myths, particularly the labors of Ulysses. She narrates how he"
1832,I.,"came to Troy in the disguise of a beggar; none knew him, ""but I alone"
1833,I.,"recognized him,"" as she had just recognized Telemachus. Thus she"
1834,I.,celebrates the cunning and bravery of Ulysses; but she also introduces
1835,I.,"a fragment of her own history: ""I longed to return home, and I lamented"
1836,I.,"the infatuation which Venus sent upon me."" She wished to be restored to"
1837,I.,"her husband who was ""in no respect lacking in mind or shape."" We must"
1838,I.,not forget that the husband was before her listening; she does not
1839,I.,forget her skill. Also Telemachus was present and hears her confession
1840,I.,"of guilt and her repentance--important stages in her total life, which"
1841,I.,"he is to know, and to take unto himself."
1842,I.,
1843,I.,"Menelaus has also his myth of Ulysses at Troy, which he now proceeds to"
1844,I.,"tell. It brings before us the Wooden Horse, really the thought of"
1845,I.,"Ulysses, though wrought by Epeios, by which the hostile city was at"
1846,I.,last captured. Here the Odyssey supplies a connecting link between
1847,I.,"itself and the Iliad, as the latter poem closes before the time of the"
1848,I.,"Wooden Horse. Ulysses is now seen to be the Hero again, he is the man"
1849,I.,"who suppresses emotion, especially domestic emotion in himself and"
1850,I.,others for the great end of the war. It suggests also the difficulty of
1851,I.,"Ulysses; he had so long suppressed his domestic instincts, and done"
1852,I.,"without the life of the family, that he will have great trouble in"
1853,I.,overcoming the alienation--whereof the Odyssey is the record. In this
1854,I.,"story of Menelaus, Helen has her part too; she came to the Wooden"
1855,I.,"Horse, ""imitating in voice the wives of all the Greek leaders,"" who"
1856,I.,"were deeply moved, yet restrained themselves except one, Anticlus,"
1857,I.,"""over whose mouth Ulysses clapped his powerful hands, and saved the"
1858,I.,"Greeks."" Truly a strong image of the suppression of feeling in himself"
1859,I.,and in others.
1860,I.,
1861,I.,But why did Helen do thus? Was it a hostile act on her part? Menelaus
1862,I.,"hints that it was at least very dangerous to the Greeks, though he"
1863,I.,"delicately lays the blame of it on some God, ""who must have inspired"
1864,I.,"thee."" She was testing the Greeks whom she supposed to be inside the"
1865,I.,horse. Will they answer the call of their wives? Do they still retain
1866,I.,"their affection for their families? Above all, does Menelaus love me"
1867,I.,"still? Such was her test, in which we witness another of her many"
1868,I.,"gifts. At any rate, she is not yet free, she is still married in Troy,"
1869,I.,though the hour of her release be near.
1870,I.,
1871,I.,"With these two stories, the note changes; the sad turn of the talk is"
1872,I.,"transformed into a quiet earnest joy, the sorrows of the present vanish"
1873,I.,"in the glorious memories of the past. The moment Troy is introduced,"
1874,I.,"the narrative becomes an Heroic Tale, a sort of Iliad, with its feats"
1875,I.,"of arms. Thus we hear the story of Ulysses while at Troy, giving two"
1876,I.,instances of his craft and his daring. Next we are to hear of him after
1877,I.,"his Trojan experience, this now theme will give the new poem, the"
1878,I.,"Odyssey, which, however, is seen to interlink at many points with the"
1879,I.,Iliad.
1880,I.,
1881,I.,"But this is sufficient, night has come on, Telemachus has heard and"
1882,I.,"beheld enough for one day. Helen disappears from the scene, she has"
1883,I.,"contributed her share, her own selfhood, to the experience of the young"
1884,I.,"man. Telemachus has seen Helen, and thus attained one supreme purpose"
1885,I.,"of Greek education. Never can that face, beautiful still, yet stamped"
1886,I.,"with all the vicissitudes of human destiny, pass out of his mind; never"
1887,I.,can that life of hers with its grand transformation pass out of his
1888,I.,"soul. The reader, too, has at this point to bid good-bye to Homer's"
1889,I.,"Helen, the most lasting creation of a woman that has yet appeared upon"
1890,I.,"our planet. A power she has, too, of continuous re-embodiment; every"
1891,I.,"poet seeks to call her up afresh, that is, if he be a poet. It may be"
1892,I.,said that each age has some incarnation of Helen; the Greek myth for
1893,I.,"two thousand years, Medieval legend, even Teutonic folk-lore have"
1894,I.,caught up her spirit and incorporated it in new forms. The last great
1895,I.,"singer of the ages has in our own time, evoked her ghost once more in"
1896,I.,"the shining palace of Menelaus at Sparta. Farewell, Helen, for this"
1897,I.,"time, but we shall meet thee again; yesterday thou didst show thyself"
1898,I.,"in a new book under a new garb, to-morrow thou art certain to appear in"
1899,I.,another. Thine is the power to re-create thyself in the soul of man
1900,I.,with every epoch and in every country. Great is that discipline of
1901,I.,"Telemachus, which we still to-day have to seek: he has seen Helen."
1902,I.,
1903,I.,"3. The preceding story was the Heroic Tale, which goes back to the"
1904,I.,"Past, especially to Troy, as the grand deed done by the united Hellenic"
1905,I.,"race, whereof the Iliad is a sample. But now we enter a new field, and"
1906,I.,"a new sort of composition, which, in default of a better name, we shall"
1907,I.,"call the Fairy Tale. Helen is not now present, nor is her struggle the"
1908,I.,"theme; Menelaus, the man, is to recount his experience in his return to"
1909,I.,Hellas.
1910,I.,
1911,I.,The story is inspired by the desire of Telemachus to know about his
1912,I.,"father. As that father is not present the question arises, Where is he?"
1913,I.,Menelaus will undertake to answer the question by a tale which shadows
1914,I.,"forth the Distant and the Future--a prophetic tale, which casts its"
1915,I.,glance through the veil of Time and Space.
1916,I.,
1917,I.,"A mythical figure appears, Proteus, the Old Man of the Sea, who is to"
1918,I.,foretell to the inquiring mortal what may be needful for his safety.
1919,I.,"Not an Olympian God is Proteus, yet a supernatural shape standing"
1920,I.,"between man and deity and mediating the two, the human and the divine."
1921,I.,For it is Proteus who sends Menelaus back to the Gods whom he has
1922,I.,neglected and offended.
1923,I.,
1924,I.,"The Fairy Tale which we are now to consider, is not to be looked upon"
1925,I.,"as an allegory; it is a story with incident, movement, character, all"
1926,I.,"in their own right, and not for the sake of something else. But we must"
1927,I.,"not, on this account, imagine that it has no thought; in fact, the"
1928,I.,Fairy Tale is just the way in which primitive peoples think. It has
1929,I.,"thought, often the profoundest thought, which darts through it, not"
1930,I.,"steadily, but fitfully in flashes at the important links, like electric"
1931,I.,"sparks. This thought we are to catch and hold, and not rest satisfied"
1932,I.,with the mere outer form of the story.
1933,I.,
1934,I.,Persons we can always find who are strongly prepossessed against seeing
1935,I.,"any meaning in the Fairy Tale, or in the Mythus. Modern usage of these"
1936,I.,"literary forms, doubtless, justifies such an opinion. Still we must"
1937,I.,"remember that Homer was not playing, but thinking with his Fairy Tale;"
1938,I.,"he had no technical terms, and almost no abstract language for"
1939,I.,expressing thought; the day of philosophic reflection had not yet
1940,I.,"dawned upon Greece. Homer has a great and deep thought to utter, but"
1941,I.,"his utterance is and must be mythical. His problem, too, he has, and it"
1942,I.,"is spiritual; the Mythus is his statement, honest, earnest, final. No,"
1943,I.,"he was not playing at story-telling, though it must have given him"
1944,I.,"pleasure; nor was his object merely to delight somebody, though he"
1945,I.,"certainly has delighted many by his song. He was the true Poet,"
1946,I.,upholding his own worth and that of his vocation; he was loyal to the
1947,I.,Muse whose word he must sing whether it find listeners or not. Homer
1948,I.,"built his legendary structure to live in, not to play in; with all his"
1949,I.,"sportiveness, he is a deeply earnest man; if his Zeus sometimes takes"
1950,I.,"on a comic mask, it is because Providence is a humorist. Homer, when he"
1951,I.,"mythologizes, is thinking, thinking as profoundly as the philosopher,"
1952,I.,and both are seeking to utter to men the same fundamental thought. The
1953,I.,"reader is to think after the poet, if not in the immediate mythical"
1954,I.,"form, then in the mediate, reflective way."
1955,I.,
1956,I.,The present Tale seeks to give an answer to the two main questions of
1957,I.,"Telemachus: Where is my father now? And, Will he return home? To answer"
1958,I.,the one question requires a knowledge of what is distant in Space; to
1959,I.,answer the other question requires a knowledge of what is distant in
1960,I.,Time. Can we not see that herein is an attempt to rise out of that
1961,I.,"twofold prison of the spirit, Space and Time, into what is true in all"
1962,I.,"places and times? In other words, Menelaus unfolds in a mythical form,"
1963,I.,"the Universal to his young pupil, and we may now see in what manner he"
1964,I.,gives the lesson.
1965,I.,
1966,I.,He leaps at once into the middle of his theme; he was in Egypt and
1967,I.,"detained there by the Gods, ""though longing to return home."" Such is"
1968,I.,"the great initial fact, he did not do his duty to the Gods. Without"
1969,I.,"their aid or without their adequate recognition, he seeks to come home."
1970,I.,This indicates the spiritual difficulty; he is indifferent to or a
1971,I.,disbeliever in the Divine. The Gods are the upholders of the
1972,I.,"world-order, they are the law and the spirit of the reality. Clearly"
1973,I.,Menelaus could not or did not fit himself into the providential system.
1974,I.,"Neglect of the Gods--that detains him, must detain him. The result is,"
1975,I.,"he and his companions are wasting away on an island, without any chance"
1976,I.,of return.
1977,I.,
1978,I.,"The question of the hour is, How shall I get out of the difficulty?"
1979,I.,"Only in one way: Acknowledge the Gods, put yourself into harmony with"
1980,I.,"their order, then the outer world and the inner man will be one, and"
1981,I.,"must bring about the deed, which is the return. We are now to witness"
1982,I.,the process whereby this reconciliation between man and the Gods takes
1983,I.,place--surely the supreme matter in life. It is told in the form of the
1984,I.,"Fairy Tale or Marvelous Legend, which shifts and changes; we, however,"
1985,I.,"must cling to the essence else it will escape us, Proteus himself we"
1986,I.,"must hold fast, and not be misled by his many appearances."
1987,I.,
1988,I.,"Menelaus begins to feel sorrow, which is a penitent condition"
1989,I.,"antecedent to all help. Moreover he wanders alone, he has gone apart"
1990,I.,"from his companions; behold, the Goddess steps out of the air and"
1991,I.,"speaks. She reproaches him with folly, and turns him to the deity who"
1992,I.,can assist him. Who is this Goddess?
1993,I.,
1994,I.,"It is Eidothea, the Goddess of Appearance, yet the daughter of Proteus,"
1995,I.,"the old First One, to whom she directs Menelaus, as the only means of"
1996,I.,"salvation. Mark how she designates Proteus: ""he is the true, the"
1997,I.,"immortal; without error, without death; he knows the depths of all the"
1998,I.,"sea""--the great sea of Time and Space, which envelops the poor mortal."
1999,I.,But he must be snared and held--surely not an easy task it is to catch
2000,I.,him.
2001,I.,
2002,I.,The etymology of the names of these two deities indicates their meaning
2003,I.,and relation. The grand dualism of the world is clearly suggested:
2004,I.,"Appearance and Substance, the Transitory and the Eternal, that which"
2005,I.,"seems and that which is. Menelaus had gone astray, he had neglected the"
2006,I.,"Gods, he had followed Appearance, Delusion, Negation; the result could"
2007,I.,"only be death. But even Appearance points to something beyond itself,"
2008,I.,"something true and eternal. So Eidothea suggests Proteus, who is her"
2009,I.,"parent; that is, she is the manifestation of his being. She is the"
2010,I.,"many, he is the one underneath and in the many; she is change, he is"
2011,I.,"the permanent in all change. He may well be designated as her father,"
2012,I.,whose transformations she knows and declares. These transformations are
2013,I.,"called his tricks or stratagems, the shapes he puts on in the world of"
2014,I.,Appearance; they are indeed Eidothea herself along with her voice
2015,I.,telling what is higher than herself.
2016,I.,
2017,I.,"When this one first principle is clearly revealed, then all is"
2018,I.,"revealed; the future becomes transparent, and the distant becomes near."
2019,I.,But you must hold fast to the one true Proteus; he will turn to
2020,I.,fire--hold fast; he will become running water--hold fast; he will
2021,I.,"change to tree, beast, reptile--hold fast. Then he will show himself in"
2022,I.,"his right shape, and will speak the fact. Hold fast; the One is under"
2023,I.,"all, and is a God, who will lift the veil of Space and Time from the"
2024,I.,visage of Truth. But unquestionably the man in his desperate struggle
2025,I.,must never forget the injunction. Hold fast to old Proteus.
2026,I.,
2027,I.,"We must note, too, that the poet has shown Menelaus as prepared to"
2028,I.,receive this divine revelation; the Greek wanderer has been brought to
2029,I.,"contrition by manifold sufferings. ""I surely must have sinned against"
2030,I.,"the Immortals,"" is his penitent outcry. Thus he is ready for the new"
2031,I.,"truth, and the voice of the Goddess speaks, when he is internally in"
2032,I.,condition to hear it. The divine word is not forced upon him; he must
2033,I.,"do his share even toward creating the same within himself. Now, along"
2034,I.,"the shore of the sea, ""he prays the Gods fervently,"" ere he goes to his"
2035,I.,"task. Egyptian Proteus he seeks to catch and to hold, for it is Proteus"
2036,I.,who is to point out to him the way of reconciliation with Zeus and the
2037,I.,Olympian Gods.
2038,I.,
2039,I.,Stress is strongly laid by the poet upon the fact that Proteus is of
2040,I.,"Egypt. Evidently, in the mind of Homer, the thought of this Fourth Book"
2041,I.,connects with the land of the Nile. What hint lies in that? The highest
2042,I.,"wisdom of Egypt, indeed, of the Orient, is just this grand distinction"
2043,I.,"between Appearance and Substance, the Transitory and the Eternal, the"
2044,I.,"Many and the One. What Egypt gave to Hellas is here suggested, nay,"
2045,I.,"said directly. In fact, the first great step in wisdom, is still to"
2046,I.,"make the above distinction, which in many ways has been handed down to"
2047,I.,us from the East.
2048,I.,
2049,I.,But the Greeks united the two sides--that which appears and that which
2050,I.,"is, or the world of sense, and the world of spirit--and thereby"
2051,I.,"produced art, the plastic forms of Gods and Men. Hellas brought forth"
2052,I.,"to the sunlight Beauty, which Egypt never could. Even here Egyptian"
2053,I.,"Proteus leads Menelaus to the Greek Gods, and becomes himself a kind of"
2054,I.,antecedent Hellenic deity. Egypt means to Greek Menelaus two things:
2055,I.,"first, it is a land of error, of alienation, of darkness; secondly, it"
2056,I.,"has its light, its wisdom, which, when he finds, points him homeward to"
2057,I.,"Hellas, to his own Gods."
2058,I.,
2059,I.,"Deeply suggestive become all these mythical hints, when we once are in"
2060,I.,"touch with their spirit. We naturally pass to the Hebrew parallel,"
2061,I.,"since that other great world-historical people of antiquity, the"
2062,I.,"Israelites, had their experience also with Egypt. For them, too, it was"
2063,I.,"a land of darkness, slavery, divine estrangement. They also sought a"
2064,I.,"Return, not dissimilar to the Greek Return, to their true home. It was"
2065,I.,"a long, terrible time, a wandering not on the water, like the"
2066,I.,"sea-faring Hellene, but in the wilderness and desert, like the"
2067,I.,"sand-faring Semite. All the companions (but two) were lost, and the"
2068,I.,leader also; moreover that leader was learned in all the wisdom of the
2069,I.,"Egyptians, but had to get out of it and away from it, and lead his"
2070,I.,people into their own possessions. Much light Egypt with all its
2071,I.,darkness furnished to Moses and Judea; much to Menelaus and to Hellas.
2072,I.,"So the two chief streams of human culture, the Greek and the Hebrew,"
2073,I.,"are traced back to the Egyptian source in the earliest books, or Bibles"
2074,I.,of the two peoples themselves.
2075,I.,
2076,I.,Moreover we find the form of the two grand experiences quite the same;
2077,I.,"there is a going into Egypt, the land of dazzling riches and power and"
2078,I.,civilization; there is the misfortune and trial in that land after a
2079,I.,"time of prosperity, finally, there is the Return home, with many"
2080,I.,wanderings and sufferings. Both peoples bring with them what may be
2081,I.,"called the Egyptian idea, yet each transforms it into its own spirit"
2082,I.,after its own fashion.
2083,I.,
2084,I.,Still further we may follow this thought and behold it as universal.
2085,I.,The form of separation and return is fundamental in human spirit; this
2086,I.,"is its inherent movement, and the shape which it imparts to the great"
2087,I.,works of literature. The very destiny of man is cast into this mould;
2088,I.,"there is, first, his estrangement, the fall from his high estate; then"
2089,I.,is his return to harmony with the divine order. The Hebrew Bible begins
2090,I.,with the Fall of Man; that is the first chapter; the rest of the book
2091,I.,"is his rise, and marks out the path of his Return which, of course,"
2092,I.,"shows many sinuosities. Such is the deepest fact of the human soul, and"
2093,I.,"to image it, there springs into existence the corresponding literary"
2094,I.,form. Not that it was taken consciously by the poet or maker after much
2095,I.,"ratiocination; he has to take it, if he sees the universe as it is."
2096,I.,"This form is the form of the everlasting reality, of which he has the"
2097,I.,"immediate vision, it is also the form of very selfhood, of the Ego."
2098,I.,
2099,I.,"Though different in many things, the Odyssey and the Bible are both, at"
2100,I.,"bottom, Returns. They restore the man after alienation. Indeed we may"
2101,I.,behold the same form as fundamental in all Great Literary Books--in
2102,I.,"Homer, in Dante, in Shakespeare, in Goethe."
2103,I.,
2104,I.,Many things connected with this catching and holding of Proteus are
2105,I.,"suggestive, but they are the flash of the poet into the depths, and"
2106,I.,"must be seen with the poetic glance, for they bear with much loss the"
2107,I.,"heavy translation into thought. How this Eidothea, the Goddess of"
2108,I.,"Appearance, turns against her own father, and helps to make him reveal"
2109,I.,himself in his true shape; how Menelaus and his three comrades put on
2110,I.,"the skins of the sea-calves, and deceive the deceiver, applying the"
2111,I.,"latter's art of transformation to himself, and destroying appearance"
2112,I.,with appearance; how the poor mortals almost perish through the odor of
2113,I.,"the skins of the sea-calves, thus showing their human weakness and"
2114,I.,"limitation, till ambrosia, the food of the Immortals, is brought by the"
2115,I.,"Goddess, which at once relieves them of their mortal ailment--these and"
2116,I.,"other incidents have their subtle, far-reaching hint of the"
2117,I.,"supersensible world. The whole story is illumined with one thought, how"
2118,I.,to master the material show of things and reach their spiritual
2119,I.,inwardness.
2120,I.,
2121,I.,"But the chief duty of these people, now disguised to destroy disguise,"
2122,I.,"is to hold the Old Man fast when they have once caught him, that"
2123,I.,"shifty, ever-changing Old Man of the Sea. Let him turn to water, to a"
2124,I.,"snake, to a lion, to a tree--hold him fast; he is the One under them"
2125,I.,"all and will at last reveal himself. Very necessary, indeed, is it to"
2126,I.,"hold fast, and never let go in the grand play of Appearances; the"
2127,I.,"strength of the man is shown by his ability to hold fast, amid the"
2128,I.,fleeting shadows of Time.
2129,I.,
2130,I.,"Menelaus holds the Old Man fast, and asks: What God detains me from my"
2131,I.,return? The answer comes home strong: Thou hast neglected the sacrifice
2132,I.,due to Zeus and the other deities; thou hast not recognized the Gods.
2133,I.,Verily the heart of the difficulty; Menelaus has not placed himself in
2134,I.,"harmony with the divine order, in which he must act. What then? Go back"
2135,I.,"to the beginning, back to Egypt, and start aright; commence thy return"
2136,I.,"again with the new light, recognize Zeus and the Gods by sacrifice"
2137,I.,"there, and thou shalt see home. Thus the Egyptian estrangement is"
2138,I.,"removed, the Greek hero of wisdom must reach beyond the experience of"
2139,I.,Egypt and be restored to the Greek Gods.
2140,I.,
2141,I.,"At once Menelaus was ready to obey, though ""his heart was broken"" at"
2142,I.,"the thought of recrossing the sea to Egypt, for the ""way was long and"
2143,I.,"difficult."" Still he will do it; and next he is given a look into the"
2144,I.,"Distant and Future, a glance into the soul of things separated from him"
2145,I.,"by Space and Time. He will know concerning the Returners, in deep"
2146,I.,accord with the spirit of the poem. He hears of the awful death of
2147,I.,"Ajax, son of Oileus, he hears of the sad fate of his brother Agamemnon;"
2148,I.,"also the Old Man of the Sea tells him a few words concerning Ulysses,"
2149,I.,who is still alive but cannot get away from the isle of Calypso. News
2150,I.,"just good enough to give hope to the son who is eagerly listening, and"
2151,I.,hears that his father still lives.
2152,I.,
2153,I.,"Finally, Menelaus learns of his own future existence from the Old Man,"
2154,I.,"who is in person the very embodiment of what lies beyond the senses, of"
2155,I.,"immortality. ""The Gods have decreed thou shalt not die, O Menelaus, but"
2156,I.,"shalt dwell in the Elysian Plain, at the ends of the earth."" He is the"
2157,I.,"husband of Helen, and coupled forever with her destiny; he is, through"
2158,I.,"her, of the divine family of Zeus. Such is the promise, has it not been"
2159,I.,fulfilled?
2160,I.,
2161,I.,"The poet thus brings to an end his Fairy Tale, with its deep-reaching"
2162,I.,glances into Egypt as one of the antecedent sources of Hellenic
2163,I.,"civilization. We find therein hinted a double relation: first, Egypt"
2164,I.,was the giver of much wisdom to Greece especially the distinction into
2165,I.,"Appearance and the one First Principle; secondly, it was hostile to"
2166,I.,"Greek spirit, which had to pass through the Egyptian stage to reach its"
2167,I.,"own destiny. Homer spins, in this Book, a thread which connects the"
2168,I.,"culture of Hellas with that of Egypt, So much we dare find in the"
2169,I.,present legend without much straining. The distant background of this
2170,I.,"entire visit of Telemachus to Sparta is Egyptian and Oriental, as we"
2171,I.,see from the talk of both Helen and Menelaus.
2172,I.,
2173,I.,"We may now be certain that Homer, the poet, had before him a thought of"
2174,I.,this kind: the inner soul of things and the outward manifestation. The
2175,I.,"story of Proteus we may call not merely a Fairy Tale, but the Fairy"
2176,I.,"Tale, which images its universal self in setting forth its special"
2177,I.,"theme; it has the one meaning, which, however, takes on many varieties"
2178,I.,of external shape; it is the essence of all Fairy Tales. Still you have
2179,I.,to catch the Proteus and make him tell his secret; I can only advise
2180,I.,"you to hold fast, and finally the true form of the Old Man will reveal"
2181,I.,"itself, and speak the truth of many appearances, nay, of all. In"
2182,I.,"reading this poem of Homer we are only following the poet, if we seek"
2183,I.,to lay hold of its essence under its varied manifestations. The whole
2184,I.,"Odyssey is a Proteus, ever changing, assuming new forms, which will"
2185,I.,utterly bewilder the reader until he reaches its first principle. Homer
2186,I.,"probably suggests that his own Fairy Tale, nay, his own poem, is a"
2187,I.,"Proteus, which must be grasped and held by the one central thought. In"
2188,I.,"fact, does not the modern reader, like ancient Menelaus, in his"
2189,I.,"wanderings need an Eidothea, an interpreter, to point out the Old Man"
2190,I.,"of the Sea, the First One, and to tell how to catch him? In the very"
2191,I.,"names of Proteus and Eidothea we feel the intention, the conscious"
2192,I.,etymology which borders on personification. Yet around this simple
2193,I.,"substrate of thought are woven so many wonders, so many suggestions,"
2194,I.,"far-hinting and deep-glancing, that it becomes truly the Tale of Tales"
2195,I.,(_Märchen aller Märchen_).
2196,I.,
2197,I.,"The Fairy Tale will appear again in the Odyssey, and take possession of"
2198,I.,the whole poem for a time when we come to the wanderings of Ulysses.
2199,I.,Now it is but a slight bubbling-up of what will be a great stream. At
2200,I.,present it turns to the East and unfolds the Greek relation thereto;
2201,I.,"hereafter it will turn to the West, and unfold the Greek relation"
2202,I.,"thereto. Both have their wise men, and the Return is from each"
2203,I.,direction to Greece. The distinction between them we may suggest in
2204,I.,"advance: the one has more of the speculative, of the spirit; the other"
2205,I.,"has more of the active, of the will, though neither side excludes the"
2206,I.,"other. Both men return to Hellas as the common destination; hence, we"
2207,I.,find in this Book everywhere expressed the intimate brotherhood between
2208,I.,Menelaus and Ulysses.
2209,I.,
2210,I.,"It is of great interest to see the poet build his Fairy Tale, which is"
2211,I.,"but one form of his mythical procedure. Instinctively he builds it, as"
2212,I.,the bee does the honey-cell. He places the God or Goddess at the center
2213,I.,of every movement or event; by divine will it is all brought about. The
2214,I.,"sea which stands in the way of the return of Ulysses is a deity,"
2215,I.,"Poseidon; Eidothea is a person, the voice of the world of Appearance,"
2216,I.,"and she leads to Proteus, the Primal One. To Homer personality is at"
2217,I.,the heart of this universe. Such is truly the mythical mind; all
2218,I.,"phenomena are the product of an intelligent will, not of blind law. Not"
2219,I.,"a long chain of cause and effect hovers before Homer's soul, thus his"
2220,I.,"work would be prose; but he sees self-cause at once, and so cannot help"
2221,I.,"being poetical, as well as religious. The culture of to-day tends too"
2222,I.,much to divest us of the mythical spirit--which is not altogether a
2223,I.,"gain. Homer, if rightly studied, will help restore that lost gift of"
2224,I.,the early ages.
2225,I.,
2226,I.,But now we must turn our look to the youth for whom the tale has been
2227,I.,told--the learner Telemachus. He hears of the Orient and its principle;
2228,I.,"the antecedents of his people, their origins, separations, their"
2229,I.,advance upon the older nations are significantly hinted. All this is an
2230,I.,education. For its function is to bring together the scattered wisdom
2231,I.,of the Past and to give it to the youth who is coming upon the stage of
2232,I.,life; thus he is made the spiritual heir of all that his race has
2233,I.,achieved in word and deed. Telemachus has learned about the history of
2234,I.,"Troy, the great event of the early Greek world; he has heard the"
2235,I.,"Returns of the Heroes, and he has seen Helen. But, chiefly, he has been"
2236,I.,taught the grand distinction between Appearance and Substance; he has
2237,I.,"come to know, if he has learned his lesson, the One in the Many; he has"
2238,I.,been shown how to reach beyond the sensuous appearances of things and
2239,I.,"enter the realm of spirit. Such is still the best education to-day,"
2240,I.,though the manner of it be so different. There were no books in those
2241,I.,"days, no schools but the lips of the aged; every Greek youth, to a"
2242,I.,"degree, was a Telemachus, and had a similar discipline. Tradition,"
2243,I.,"song, folk-lore are also means of education; we cannot do without the"
2244,I.,"mythus even now, and we are in many ways seeking to restore it to its"
2245,I.,"place in the training of the child, and of the grown man too."
2246,I.,"Telemachus has graduated, he can now go home; so he asks to be"
2247,I.,"permitted to depart for Ithaca, where the hardest practical problem of"
2248,I.,"life is awaiting him. But mark, he carries with him the grandest of all"
2249,I.,hospitable presents: the knowledge of the true and eternal in contrast
2250,I.,to the unreal and transitory.
2251,I.,
2252,I.,In these four Books of the Odyssey the education of the Homeric youth
2253,I.,has been given. Next we are to have the experiences of the man--those
2254,I.,"of the typical man Ulysses, as he works out his own problem. Menelaus"
2255,I.,"could not tell that tale; the man himself must be seen doing,"
2256,I.,overcoming his obstacles by the deed. He will present a phase of life
2257,I.,"not known to the East, not known to Egyptian Proteus. Thus the Odyssey"
2258,I.,"will be an entire book, a veritable Bible for young and old, with its"
2259,I.,complete cycle of human discipline.
2260,I.,
2261,I.,"The story of Proteus itself is Protean, and must be grasped in its"
2262,I.,essence through all its appearances. The whole Odyssey is veritably a
2263,I.,"Protean poem as already said, whose study is to seize the one truth"
2264,I.,which is underneath all these shifting shapes and manifold events. What
2265,I.,are we doing now but trying to grasp Proteus in this exposition? There
2266,I.,is no mythus in Homer which has wound itself so deeply and so variously
2267,I.,into the literature of the world. It would be an interesting history to
2268,I.,"trace its employment by later poets, and see how it has mirrored itself"
2269,I.,"in the consciousness of the ages. The last world-poet, Goethe, takes"
2270,I.,"the figure of Proteus from his eldest brother, the first world-poet,"
2271,I.,"and transplants it into the Second Part of Faust, where it has its"
2272,I.,place in the development of the modern man. The Mythus of Evolution the
2273,I.,"tale of Proteus becomes in Goethe's hands, and hints of Darwinism long"
2274,I.,before Darwin.
2275,I.,
2276,I.,Still the most significant historical fact of this Fourth Book is the
2277,I.,connection which it makes between Egypt and Greece. In another Greek
2278,I.,"legend, that of OEdipus, the same connection is made through the"
2279,I.,"Sphinx, whose riddle the Greek hero solves, whereat the Egyptian"
2280,I.,monster destroys itself.
2281,I.,
2282,I.,"The Sphinx, the grand symbol of Egypt and chief product of its Art, may"
2283,I.,be taken as the Egyptian starting-point for both Greece and Judea. The
2284,I.,"Sphinx is half human, half animal; the two are put together in stone"
2285,I.,"and thus stand a fixed, unreconciled contradiction. Such was just the"
2286,I.,Sphinx-riddle of humanity to the old Egyptian: man is a beast and a
2287,I.,"spirit, linked together without any true mediation. Both the Hebrew and"
2288,I.,"the Greek sought to solve this grand riddle, each in his own way. The"
2289,I.,Hebrew attempted to extirpate the sensuous element; he would have no
2290,I.,"graven image, no idolatry, he would worship only the pure spirit, and"
2291,I.,"obey only the divine law. The Greek reconciled the two sides, by making"
2292,I.,the sensuous element the bearer and the revealer of the spiritual. The
2293,I.,"animal must be subordinated to the spirit, then it can live, nay can"
2294,I.,"have a new and higher existence. Thus Art arose in Greece, and not in"
2295,I.,Judea.
2296,I.,
2297,I.,The interpretations which the story of Proteus has received are simply
2298,I.,infinite. Probably it appeals to every reader in a somewhat different
2299,I.,fashion; he pours into this marvelous form certain phases of his own
2300,I.,"experience and is satisfied. Indeed Proteus is not only a Form, but a"
2301,I.,"Form of Forms for the human mind, hinting both the oneness and the"
2302,I.,multiplicity of the Ego itself. We may go back to the Vedas and find
2303,I.,traces of it there in some sun-myth; we may go to the sea and find it a
2304,I.,miraculous legend in which the Greek sailor set forth his perils and
2305,I.,"his escapes. It certainly connects Hellas with Egypt, and suggests the"
2306,I.,movement of ancient civilization. Menelaus in his voyage transcends the
2307,I.,"Greek world of the Trojan epoch, and brings back the story thereof to"
2308,I.,his country. The tale of Proteus is said to have been carried back to
2309,I.,"Egypt, where Herodotus, several hundred years after Homer, found it in"
2310,I.,"a new transformation, Proteus being a king of Egypt, who took Helen"
2311,I.,from Paris and kept her till Menelaus arrived and received her from the
2312,I.,Egyptian ruler. Thus the Fairy Tale raised the Old Man of the Sea to
2313,I.,"the royal dignity, changing sovereignty from water to land. (_Herodotus_,"
2314,I.,"II. 112-20.) Plato makes him typical of a sophist, Schlegel of a poet,"
2315,I.,Lucian of a dancer.
2316,I.,
2317,I.,We shall now take a glance backwards and give a short summary of the
2318,I.,"story, that its inner development in the hands of the poet may be more"
2319,I.,fully seen.
2320,I.,
2321,I.,1. The desolation of Menelaus and his companions on the island of
2322,I.,"Pharos; no Return possible, death from hunger imminent. Moreover,"
2323,I.,"disregard of the Gods, internal estrangement, a condition of separation"
2324,I.,"from the Divine, truly an Egyptian condition."
2325,I.,
2326,I.,"2. Eidothea appears to him, just the Goddess of Appearance, and points"
2327,I.,him to a power beyond herself. Hitherto he was lost in the world of
2328,I.,"Appearance; but when he thinks of it, he separates himself from it, and"
2329,I.,"sees its nullity. So the Finite points to the Infinite, the Fleeting to"
2330,I.,"the Permanent, the Sensible to the Supersensible, Eidothea to Proteus,"
2331,I.,"who is the First One, or the First Principle underlying all Appearance,"
2332,I.,hence her father.
2333,I.,
2334,I.,"3. She tells also how to catch him. When he emerges from the water,"
2335,I.,"source of all Forms, indeed just the Formable (see Goethe's Faust, Part"
2336,I.,"II. in the _Classical Walpurgisnight_), he will count by fives all his"
2337,I.,"sea-calves, or sea-forms, offspring of the sea (Halosydna). This"
2338,I.,"counting by fives, is significant, hinting the earliest abstraction"
2339,I.,"from the sensuous through number, specially by means of the five-system,"
2340,I.,"though Homer knew well the decimal system (see _Od._ XVI, 245. _Iliad_"
2341,I.,"II. 126). Menelaus with his companions is to take on this sea-form, and"
2342,I.,"be counted with the rest, though in disguise; then when Proteus lies"
2343,I.,"down to sleep with his herds or Forms, he is to be seized; that is,"
2344,I.,"seized in repose, as he is himself, not in relation to his shapes. They"
2345,I.,"must continue to hold fast to this primal Form of Proteus, or the"
2346,I.,"archetype, through all his changes, till he resumes his first shape,"
2347,I.,"""the one in which thou sawest him in repose."" Then they possess the"
2348,I.,Essence as distinct from the Phenomenon; they know that their disguise
2349,I.,"has torn off all disguise, and attained the real."
2350,I.,
2351,I.,4. Proteus will now tell Menelaus the truth devoid of all delusive
2352,I.,shows; ere the latter can leave Egypt and return to Greece he must put
2353,I.,"himself into harmony with the Greek Gods, Zeus and the rest. So he has"
2354,I.,to go back to Egypt's river and start over again in the right way. Then
2355,I.,he will make the Return to Hellas.
2356,I.,
2357,I.,5. Proteus also gives the fate of a number of Returners. Ajax he
2358,I.,"specially speaks about--Ajax, son of Oileus (not the greater Ajax), the"
2359,I.,"blasphemer, who said he would return in spite of the Gods, and at once"
2360,I.,perished. The account of the death of Ajax has its meaning for
2361,I.,"Menelaus, who thought of getting home with paying due regard to the"
2362,I.,Gods. Once more Agamemnon's dire lot is told with some new incidents
2363,I.,added. Thirdly Proteus has seen Ulysses in an ocean isle with the nymph
2364,I.,Calypso who detains him though eager to get away. Thus the son hears
2365,I.,the fact about his father. Finally Proteus prophesies the immortality
2366,I.,"of Menelaus, for has not the latter reached beyond Appearance into the"
2367,I.,"Eternal already, just by catching and holding Proteus? So the Old Man"
2368,I.,"of the Sea cannot help giving this prophecy, which lives directly in"
2369,I.,his own experience.
2370,I.,
2371,I.,"Though Telemachus is not told that his father is returning, still he"
2372,I.,"may draw such an inference from the story of Menelaus, who was also"
2373,I.,"detained on an island longing to get home. If the Gods, being duly"
2374,I.,"recognized, will give their help in the one case, they will in the"
2375,I.,"other; they too, will come to the aid of Ulysses, when he has placed"
2376,I.,himself in harmony with them. This is what is about to happen.
2377,I.,
2378,I.,"As already set forth, there are three divisions of this first part of"
2379,I.,"the Fourth Book: the simple idyllic Present at Sparta, the disrupted"
2380,I.,"strifeful Past at Troy, the movement out of the latter by way of Egypt."
2381,I.,"Taking the three divisions together, we note that they form the total"
2382,I.,"sweep of one great Return, that of Menelaus, from unity through"
2383,I.,separation back to harmony. Thus Menelaus and also Helen are shown to
2384,I.,have solved their problem.
2385,I.,
2386,I.,"But there remains the harder and deeper problem of Ithaca, which is"
2387,I.,"that of Ulysses. Here enemies have possession of the man's home, and he"
2388,I.,"brings back no help, only himself. It is therefore, a natural"
2389,I.,transition to introduce at this point the Ithacan condition which is
2390,I.,"seen to be more difficult than the Spartan one, for Menelaus seems to"
2391,I.,"have had no enemies in his house to dispute his Return, as Agamemnon"
2392,I.,"had and also Ulysses has. But Agamemnon perished, Ulysses will not."
2393,I.,
2394,I.,
2395,II.,II.
2396,II.,
2397,II.,"Accordingly the affairs of Ithaca are introduced, as they happened"
2398,II.,after the departure of Telemachus. This thread is picked up from the
2399,II.,"Second Book, where he had his final conference with the Suitors and"
2400,II.,told them his mind. We must recall that Ithaca is the abode of conflict
2401,II.,and disorder; the Suitors and Household of Penelope are the two
2402,II.,antagonistic elements; upon both the secret departure of Telemachus
2403,II.,"explodes like a bomb, and brings the characters of each side to the"
2404,II.,surface.
2405,II.,
2406,II.,Telemachus stands in relation to the Suitors as well as to his mother;
2407,II.,both are putting their restraints upon him which he has broken through
2408,II.,"and asserted his freedom, his new manhood. One, however, is the"
2409,II.,"restraint of hate, the other is the restraint of love; both stand in"
2410,II.,the way of his development. He must get his great education in defiance
2411,II.,of Suitors and of mother. The attitudes of these two parties are
2412,II.,"described, and form the two divisions of this second part of the Fourth"
2413,II.,Book.
2414,II.,
2415,II.,"1. The Suitors, when they hear of the deed of Telemachus, are not only"
2416,II.,"surprised but startled, and they at once recognise that a new power has"
2417,II.,risen which threatens to punish their misdeeds. The youth has plainly
2418,II.,"become a man, a man showing the skill and courage of his father, and"
2419,II.,with the sense of wrong burning in his breast. Already he has declared
2420,II.,"that he would wreak vengeance upon them, the day of reckoning seems to"
2421,II.,have dawned. Previously they despised his warnings as the helpless
2422,II.,"babble of a mere boy; now they have to meet him, returning, possibly,"
2423,II.,with help from his father's friends.
2424,II.,
2425,II.,"What will the Suitors do? The most audacious one, Antinous, is ready"
2426,II.,"with a proposal. The boy will prove a pest, we must waylay him on his"
2427,II.,"return and murder him. Such is their final act of wrong, which is now"
2428,II.,"accepted by all, and the proposer gets ready to carry out his plan."
2429,II.,"Hitherto it may be said the Suitors had a certain right, the right of"
2430,II.,"suit, which, however, becomes doubtful through the uncertainty about"
2431,II.,"the death of the husband, and through the unwillingness of the wife."
2432,II.,"But now their guilt is brought out in strong colors, there can be no"
2433,II.,question about it. They man a boat and lie in wait for their prey on a
2434,II.,little island which the youth has to pass in coming home.
2435,II.,
2436,II.,"2. The mother Penelope hears of the daring act of her boy, done without"
2437,II.,"her consent or knowledge. The news is brought to her, just as she is"
2438,II.,recounting the goodness of Ulysses and the wrongs of the Suitors. This
2439,II.,"new misfortune, for so it seemed to her, is quite too great a burden to"
2440,II.,bear; she breaks out into lamentations find recites her woes: a husband
2441,II.,lost and now a son in the greatest danger. But she is to get both human
2442,II.,"and divine consolation. Eurycleia, the old nurse, confesses to her part"
2443,II.,"in the affair, and advises the queen ""to put on fresh garments and to"
2444,II.,"pray to Pallas, ascending to the upper chamber."""
2445,II.,
2446,II.,Pallas sends to the distressed mother a refreshing sleep and a
2447,II.,"consoling dream, which we may consider to have been suggested by the"
2448,II.,"words of Eurycleia. Her sister who dwelt far away, appears to her and"
2449,II.,"says that her son, guided by Pallas, will surely return. Doubtless we"
2450,II.,see here an expression of the deepest instinct of Penelope; the outer
2451,II.,suggestion of the nurse and her own unconscious faith fuse together and
2452,II.,form the phantom and give to the same an utterance. The youth who can
2453,II.,plan and carry out such an expedition will probably be able to take
2454,II.,"care of himself. Penelope of course has some doubt, since the good"
2455,II.,"Ulysses has had to suffer so much from the Gods. About him, too, she"
2456,II.,will know and so inquires of the phantom. Doth he live? But the shadowy
2457,II.,"image can tell nothing, the act of Ulysses lies not in its field of"
2458,II.,"vision, it declines to speak further and vanishes."
2459,II.,
2460,II.,Thus Telemachus has broken through the two restraints which held him in
2461,II.,"bondage at his Ithacan home, both keeping down his manly endeavor. The"
2462,II.,"first comes from the Suitors and is the restraint of hate, which would"
2463,II.,"give him no opportunity in the world of action, and in addition is"
2464,II.,"destroying his possessions. The second restraint springs from love, and"
2465,II.,yet is injurious. The solicitude of the mother keeps him back from
2466,II.,"every enterprise; having lost her husband, as she deems, by his too"
2467,II.,"adventuresome spirit, she is afraid of losing her boy for the same"
2468,II.,"reason, and is in danger of losing him anyhow, by making him a cipher."
2469,II.,Such are the two obstacles in Ithaca which Telemachus is shown
2470,II.,surmounting and asserting therein his freedom and manhood. The whole is
2471,II.,"a flash of his father's mettle, he is already the unconscious Ulysses;"
2472,II.,no wonder that he inquires after his parent in Pylos and Sparta. The
2473,II.,poet will now carry him forward to the point where he will actually
2474,II.,meet and know Ulysses himself; the son is to advance to direct
2475,II.,communion with his great father.
2476,II.,
2477,II.,"Here the Fourth Book, or rather the Telemachiad, reaches out and"
2478,II.,"connects with the Ithakeiad, which begins in the Thirteenth Book."
2479,II.,Ulysses returns to Ithaca and steals to the hut of the swineherd
2480,II.,"Eumæus; Telemachus comes back from Sparta, and, avoiding the ambush of"
2481,II.,"the Suitors, seeks the same faithful servant. Thus father and son are"
2482,II.,"brought together, and prepare themselves for their heroic task."
2483,II.,
2484,II.,"But before this task can be accomplished, the grand experience of"
2485,II.,"Ulysses is to be told in the eight following Books (V-XII); that is, we"
2486,II.,"are now to have the Ulyssiad, just as we have had the Telemachiad."
2487,II.,Father and son are now separated from home and country; both are to
2488,II.,return through a common deed of heroism.
2489,II.,
2490,II.,_General Observations._ Looking back at the Telemachiad (the first four
2491,II.,Books) we observe that it constitutes a very distinct member of the
2492,II.,total organism of the Odyssey. So distinct is it that some expositors
2493,II.,"have held that it is a separate poem, not an integral portion of the"
2494,II.,"entire action. The joint is, indeed, plain at this place, still it is a"
2495,II.,"joint of the poetic body, and not a whole poetic body by itself. Only"
2496,II.,"too easy is it for our thought to dwell in division, separation,"
2497,II.,"scission, analysis; let us now turn to the opposite and more difficult"
2498,II.,"habit of mind, that of uniting, harmonizing, making the synthesis of"
2499,II.,what seems disjointed. In other words let us find the bonds of
2500,II.,"connection between the last four Books and the coming eight Books, or"
2501,II.,between the Telemachiad and the Ulyssiad.
2502,II.,
2503,II.,"1. We have already noticed the three grand Returns, rising one above"
2504,II.,"the other to the culmination--that of Nestor, of Menelaus, of Ulysses."
2505,II.,Now the first two are told in the Telemachiad; but they openly lead up
2506,II.,"to the third, which is the complete Return, and which is just the theme"
2507,II.,"of the Ulyssiad. Nestor makes the immediate Return, without conflict,"
2508,II.,"through Greece, but he points directly to Menelaus, and foreshadows the"
2509,II.,"coming of Ulysses. Menelaus, however, prophesies the third Return, and"
2510,II.,thus directly joins his account with the Ulyssiad. In this manner we
2511,II.,see and feel the intimate bond between these two grand divisions of the
2512,II.,total Odyssey.
2513,II.,
2514,II.,2. We notice the same general movement in the Telemachiad and in the
2515,II.,Ulyssiad; the same fundamental scheme underlies both. There is the real
2516,II.,"Present, in the one case Ithaca, Pylos, Sparta, in the other ease"
2517,II.,Phæacia; then there is in the same heroic Past the Trojan war and its
2518,II.,"deeds of valor; thirdly there is a movement in both to an ideal world,"
2519,II.,"to a Fableland, outside of Hellas and beyond even Troy; finally there"
2520,II.,is a Return in both to Greece and to the Present. Setting the stages of
2521,II.,"this movement down in definite numbers, we have, first in the"
2522,II.,"Telemachiad: (1) Hellas, the Present; (2) back to Troy, the Past, in"
2523,II.,"the reminiscences of Nestor, Menelaus, Helen; (3) forward to the Fairy"
2524,II.,World in the account of Proteus; (4) return to Ithaca at the end of the
2525,II.,Fourth Book. Secondly in the Ulyssiad we may here note in advance the
2526,II.,"same general movement: (1) Phæacia, the Present; (2) back to Troy in"
2527,II.,the strains of Demodocus; (3) forward to the Fairy World of Polyphemus
2528,II.,and Circe; (4) return to Ithaca in the Thirteenth Book. Thus we reach
2529,II.,down and grasp the fundamental norm according to which the poet
2530,II.,"wrought, and which holds in unity all the differences between these two"
2531,II.,"divisions of the poem. The spiritual basis of this movement, its"
2532,II.,"psychological ground, we shall endeavor to unfold more fully hereafter."
2533,II.,
2534,II.,"3. In correspondence with the preceding, we can distinguish in both"
2535,II.,divisions the same kinds of style: (1) the symple Idyllic Tale of the
2536,II.,Present; (2) the Heroic Tale recounting the Past and specially the
2537,II.,Trojan war; (3) the Fairy Tale which introduces a supernatural realm.
2538,II.,"Each of these styles is poetic, yet with its own coloring and"
2539,II.,character. Here again we should observe the author employing his
2540,II.,"fundamental norm of composition a second time, and thus re-asserting"
2541,II.,himself as the same person in both divisions of the poem--in the
2542,II.,Telemachiad as well as in the Ulyssiad.
2543,II.,
2544,II.,"4. In each division, again, there is a supreme woman at the center of"
2545,II.,"domestic life--Penelope in the one, Arete in the other, each being wife"
2546,II.,"and mother, each supremely faithful to her institution, the Family."
2547,II.,This predominance and glorification of the married woman and the home
2548,II.,"constitute a common characteristic of both divisions, and show the same"
2549,II.,"fundamental conception of her worth, as well as of her position in the"
2550,II.,social order. It may be doubted if Modern Literature has improved upon
2551,II.,this Homeric representation.
2552,II.,
2553,II.,5. Then the contrasts between the Telemachiad and the Ulyssiad link
2554,II.,"them together. Disturbed Ithaca, peaceful Phæacia; the theoretic"
2555,II.,"education of the son, the practical discipline of the father;"
2556,II.,"Telemachus, the son of his father, Nausicaa, the daughter of her"
2557,II.,"mother, the Ithacan boy and the Phæacian girl--such are a few of these"
2558,II.,"contrasts. Finally father and son, strongly contrasted, yet having"
2559,II.,"their unity in this family of which they are members, suggest the unity"
2560,II.,of the poem of which they are characters.
2561,II.,
2562,II.,These bonds of connection are so strong that they overbalance all
2563,II.,"discrepancies of single passages, interpolations, and inconsistencies"
2564,II.,"of detail. Still, if the mind of the critic refuses the general sweep,"
2565,II.,"and insists upon prying asunder the joints, and upon looking through"
2566,II.,"its microscope at the little things, it will find only separation,"
2567,II.,"discord, and many small Homers instead of a single great Homer. The"
2568,II.,"particular always divides, but the general unites; so the Homeric poems"
2569,II.,"will have two sets of reader, the dividers and the unifiers."
2570,II.,
2571,II.,"_The Education of Telemachus._ This is another name, which we have"
2572,II.,"frequently used, for the Telemachiad. The Homeric youth is also to get"
2573,II.,his training for life; he is to find and to take possession of his
2574,II.,inheritance transmitted from the Past. The general statement of this
2575,II.,educational fact occurs frequently in the work: Telemachus wishes to
2576,II.,"know about his father. That is his immediate inquiry, which will extend"
2577,II.,to knowing something about the fathers and what they did; then his
2578,II.,"investigation will go beyond the fathers and the Greek world, reaching"
2579,II.,over into Egypt and the East. The function of education is to put into
2580,II.,"possession of the coming man the wisdom of the Past, and specially the"
2581,II.,means for acquiring this wisdom; then he can transmit the intelligence
2582,II.,of the race to those who are to follow him. So Telemachus has attained
2583,II.,the age when he must know ancestral wisdom. Such is his strong
2584,II.,"instinct, he feels his limitation, he is penned up in a narrow life at"
2585,II.,"Ithaca, whose barriers cramp his free spirit. This intense desire for"
2586,II.,"education, for finding out something about the world in which he is"
2587,II.,"placed, is the starting point for the boy. He shows his spirit by"
2588,II.,breaking through the restraint of the Suitors and his mother in order
2589,II.,"to get an education. Like many a youth to-day, he has to leave home,"
2590,II.,"has to run away, in fact, that he may have his opportunity. What does"
2591,II.,"he get? Or, what is the content of this education! Let us see."
2592,II.,
2593,II.,1. We find that he gets a fair amount of religious training. He has
2594,II.,been led through the misfortunes of his House to question the goodness
2595,II.,of Providence and the superintendence of the Gods. But Minerva gives
2596,II.,"him a strong lesson, so does Nestor. He obtains a glimpse of the Divine"
2597,II.,"Order, and feels the necessity of keeping in harmony with the same. The"
2598,II.,outcome of his visit must impress him with the providential side in
2599,II.,human action.
2600,II.,
2601,II.,"2. He sees new countries, talks with famous men, and partakes of their"
2602,II.,"wisdom. Chiefly, however, he hears of the grand Return in its manifold"
2603,II.,"phases; he learns the story of those who failed, of those who reached"
2604,II.,"home, like Nestor and Menelaus. Great is the lesson; this Return images"
2605,II.,"the movement of the soul, the breach within and the restoration. It is"
2606,II.,"remotely his own inner life outlined, and that of every man; Telemachus"
2607,II.,"has just made a separation from home and country, to which he must come"
2608,II.,back and be reconciled. His own soul-form he must dimly feel in the
2609,II.,"great Return of the Heroes from Troy, and their various destinies he"
2610,II.,must recognize to be his own possibilities.
2611,II.,
2612,II.,"3. Telemachus the aspiring youth, is trying to recover his patrimony,"
2613,II.,"which is of two kinds, physical and spiritual. The Suitors are"
2614,II.,"destroying the one, and keeping it out of his hands; with them is one"
2615,II.,"conflict, that of justice. But he must also inherit his father's mental"
2616,II.,riches; he has to separate from home and his mother to find this form
2617,II.,of wealth or even to learn of its nature. So Telemachus has his Trojan
2618,II.,"expedition, not so great in itself, yet, adventurous enough for a boy."
2619,II.,He is moving on the lines of his father when the latter went to Troy--a
2620,II.,national affair; but his deed is a breaking loose from boyhood--the
2621,II.,breach out of which he is to come back a man.
2622,II.,
2623,II.,4. The form of this educative process of the Odyssey is very different
2624,II.,"from ours. It seizes hold of the mythical element in man, and the"
2625,II.,reader of to-day is to penetrate to the meaning by something of an
2626,II.,effort. Telemachus is to see Helen; what does that signify in
2627,II.,education? He is to hear the Tale of Proteus and feel its purport in
2628,II.,relation to his own discipline. One asks: Is not this imaginative form
2629,II.,still a vital element of education? The Odyssey has been and is now a
2630,II.,school-book of the race.
2631,II.,

2634,II.,
2635,_THE ULYSSIAD._,_THE ULYSSIAD._
2636,_THE ULYSSIAD._,
2637,_THE ULYSSIAD._,
2638,_THE ULYSSIAD._,"We have now reached the second grand division of the poem, the Odyssey"
2639,_THE ULYSSIAD._,"proper, which we have named under necessity the Ulyssiad, and which"
2640,_THE ULYSSIAD._,gives an account of the adventures of Ulysses before he comes to Ithaca
2641,_THE ULYSSIAD._,and joins Telemachus. If the division which we have just had may be
2642,_THE ULYSSIAD._,"called the education of a youth, this division may be called the"
2643,_THE ULYSSIAD._,discipline of a man through experience of the world. The whole embraces
2644,_THE ULYSSIAD._,"eight Books, fifth to twelfth inclusive, with a little of the"
2645,_THE ULYSSIAD._,thirteenth. There is no doubt that this is the most subtly constructed
2646,_THE ULYSSIAD._,"piece of writing in existence, transparent in the highest degree, and"
2647,_THE ULYSSIAD._,"yet profound as thought itself. We may therefore, look a little at the"
2648,_THE ULYSSIAD._,structure in advance.
2649,_THE ULYSSIAD._,
2650,_THE ULYSSIAD._,The first thing to be noticed is that there are two very distinct
2651,_THE ULYSSIAD._,movements in the present division. On the one hand the action moves
2652,_THE ULYSSIAD._,"through three separate localities--Ogygia or Calypso's Island, Phæacia,"
2653,_THE ULYSSIAD._,Fableland. This external movement of the poem has its inner
2654,_THE ULYSSIAD._,"counterpart, which the reader is to penetrate. On the other hand there"
2655,_THE ULYSSIAD._,"is the movement of the individual, the Hero Ulysses, who begins with"
2656,_THE ULYSSIAD._,"Fableland, passes through Ogygia and comes to Phæacia. This movement"
2657,_THE ULYSSIAD._,also has its corresponding internal significance. As the first movement
2658,_THE ULYSSIAD._,"is that of the poem, or of the world, we may call it objective; as the"
2659,_THE ULYSSIAD._,"second movement is that of the individual man, we may call it"
2660,_THE ULYSSIAD._,"subjective. The two together, accordingly, spin the two strands of the"
2661,_THE ULYSSIAD._,world and of man into the one thread of existence. Both we shall
2662,_THE ULYSSIAD._,consider.
2663,_THE ULYSSIAD._,
2664,_THE ULYSSIAD._,
2665,I.,I.
2666,I.,
2667,I.,The objective sweep with its three localities is coupled with
2668,I.,geographical names which have given to the erudite guild a great deal
2669,I.,"of trouble, with very small reward. In general these names of places"
2670,I.,"may be deemed to be mythical, yet with certain far-off gleams of actual"
2671,I.,lands. Much more distinct and real is their spiritual significance. The
2672,I.,"objective movement shadows forth the movement of society, the rise of"
2673,I.,"civilization, the becoming of the institutional world, which is here"
2674,I.,unfolded through three stages in the following order:--
2675,I.,
2676,I.,1. Ogygia.
2677,I.,2. Phæacia.
2678,I.,3. Fableland.
2679,I.,
2680,I.,1. Ogygia is the pure product of nature without cultivation or with
2681,I.,very little. It is the place where the natural man must conquer his
2682,I.,"appetites, and long for, and finally seek for, a realm of order."
2683,I.,"Calypso is the concealer, she who conceals spirit in the jungle of"
2684,I.,"nature. Here, then, occurs the primordial breach between the physical"
2685,I.,"and spiritual, out of which an institutional world can rise."
2686,I.,
2687,I.,"2. Phæacia now appears, in which we behold the fundamental institutions"
2688,I.,"of man, Family and State, in their primitive idyllic condition, yet"
2689,I.,transcendently pure and beautiful. The evolution of this new order from
2690,I.,the savage Cyclops is hinted in the poem. Only after Calypso is put
2691,I.,"aside, do Arete the wife and Nausicaa the maid become possible. Upon"
2692,I.,"such a foundation a social system can be developed, with commerce,"
2693,I.,"navigation, etc. Still further, Phæacia can begin to mirror itself in"
2694,I.,"art, as it does here in the songs of the bard, and also in games."
2695,I.,
2696,I.,"3. Fableland comes next, really a product of self-conscious art. In it"
2697,I.,are set forth the struggles which arise between man and the civilized
2698,I.,order. Phæacia is the simple condition of peace; man is in complete
2699,I.,harmony with himself and his institutional environment. But what if he
2700,I.,"falls out with both? That will be a new stage, represented by a new set"
2701,I.,"of beings, who are to indicate not so much the conflict with nature as"
2702,I.,"the conflict with spirit. The world of reality is transcended,"
2703,I.,"marvelous shapes sweep into view, Polyphemus, Circe, the Sirens, even"
2704,I.,"the supersensible realm of Hades--all of which, however, must await a"
2705,I.,special exposition. Still we should note that after this ideal realm of
2706,I.,"struggle and desperate enterprise comes the real world of strife,"
2707,I.,"Ithaca, which is to be harmonized by the man who has passed through"
2708,I.,"this Fableland, and has reached an ideal harmony in Phæacia."
2709,I.,
2710,I.,
2711,II.,II.
2712,II.,
2713,II.,We soon find that Ulysses has been thrown back to Calypso's Isle from
2714,II.,"Fableland, of which in a certain sense it is the continuation. The"
2715,II.,"circle which he has passed through is, therefore, the following:--"
2716,II.,
2717,II.,1. Fableland.
2718,II.,2. Ogygia.
2719,II.,3. Phæacia.
2720,II.,
2721,II.,"This is, then, the movement of the individual, in contrast with the"
2722,II.,"previous sweep of the poem as a whole, which represents the movement of"
2723,II.,"the world. Both are bound together, both pass through the same stages,"
2724,II.,though in a different order. The process of social development begins
2725,II.,"with the state of Nature, with Ogygia, unfolds into a simple"
2726,II.,"institutional life, into Phæacia, which then enters into certain"
2727,II.,"negative phases, such as are seen in Fableland. But the man from Troy,"
2728,II.,"Ulysses, begins with the last, and is whelmed back into the first, and"
2729,II.,finally rests in the second before going to Ithaca. Let us note this
2730,II.,personal movement in a little more detail.
2731,II.,
2732,II.,"1. Ulysses passes into Fableland, having wantonly done a deed of"
2733,II.,violence against civilized life and order by destroying the city of the
2734,II.,"Ciconians (Book IX), as he was returning from the Trojan War. Such is"
2735,II.,"the negative element in him, which has been engendered by that war, and"
2736,II.,"which now appears in various manifestations, such as his doings with"
2737,II.,"Polyphemus and Circe, till his career in Fableland winds up with"
2738,II.,destroying the Oxen of the Sun. This is the extreme negative act which
2739,II.,throws him back beyond Circe's into Calypso's realm. He assaults really
2740,II.,"his own will in this last act, he undermines his own power of recovery,"
2741,II.,"he puts out his own light. Circe would have sent him forward again,"
2742,II.,leaving intact his will-power; Calypso detains him lulled in the
2743,II.,sensuous delights of her bower. He denies his own reason; how then can
2744,II.,he rise after a fall? Indeed what use is there of rising? So he sinks
2745,II.,"down into Ogygia, the Dark Island."
2746,II.,
2747,II.,"2. It is no wonder, therefore, that he remained with Calypso seven"
2748,II.,"years and more, draining to the dregs the cup of that life. Still he"
2749,II.,"has desire to return home, must have it, he must possess reason to deny"
2750,II.,"reason. He longs for what he has not, sensuous charms cannot drown his"
2751,II.,aspiration; such is the Hell in which he has placed himself. Still even
2752,II.,"here when he has passed his probation, he must be released by a decree"
2753,II.,"of the Gods, who, formerly favorable to Neptune, the divine foe of"
2754,II.,"Ulysses, have now become friendly to Minerva, the Hero's protectress."
2755,II.,Why this change in the everlasting powers? When Ulysses is ready to
2756,II.,"leave Ogygia, the Gods cannot keep him there, they have to change; the"
2757,II.,"divine Order must help him escape, if it be divine. This is just what"
2758,II.,"happens; Zeus, voice of the Olympian law, commands his departure, and"
2759,II.,Calypso must obey.
2760,II.,
2761,II.,"3. Ulysses, then, comes to Phæacia, an institutional land with social,"
2762,II.,"domestic, and political life. From the grot of Calypso he passes to the"
2763,II.,home of Arete; both woman and man are in an ethical relation. He sees a
2764,II.,"world of peace and harmony, he witnesses the corrective of his own"
2765,II.,"negative Trojan experience. He, having taken Phæacia into himself, has"
2766,II.,a remedy for distracted Ithaca; he has beheld an ideal to which he can
2767,II.,adjust his own land. He was not the man to bring civil order to Ithaca
2768,II.,just after the destruction of Troy; now he has passed through his own
2769,II.,"destructive phases, has become conscious of them, has told them to the"
2770,II.,"Phæacians, which long account has in it the character of a confession."
2771,II.,"All is given in a mythical form, but it is none the less an"
2772,II.,acknowledgment of error from first to last. He is the poetical
2773,II.,"confessor of himself, and the Phæacians are contemplating the grand"
2774,II.,experience in the mirror of art.
2775,II.,
2776,II.,We may now see the reason why the poet began the story of Ulysses with
2777,II.,the stay at Calypso's Isle. Thus the poem unfolds in the order of
2778,II.,"society, starting with the state of nature, passing thence to a"
2779,II.,"civilized condition, and showing finally the conflicts of the same with"
2780,II.,the negative forces which develop in its own bosom. Homer could have
2781,II.,"landed Ulysses at Phæacia, and could have made the Ulyssiad start in"
2782,II.,"that sphere, placing Calypso's Book just after the account of the"
2783,II.,slaughter of the Oxen of the Sun. But what a loss would that have been!
2784,II.,No social development would thus be suggested in the movement of the
2785,II.,"poem, and the individual Ulysses would have to pass, not from"
2786,II.,"institutional Phæacia, but from savage Ogygia to the reformation of"
2787,II.,"Ithaca. In this way we realize to ourselves the true instinct, or"
2788,II.,perchance the profound thought which underlies the structure of this
2789,II.,portion of the poem.
2790,II.,
2791,II.,Thus we conceive the double movement of the Ulyssiad through its three
2792,II.,"main stages, in which we feel strongly emphasized the idea of"
2793,II.,"development, of a genetic process. These lands and peoples are"
2794,II.,"generated by the wanderer's own spirit, though they all exist in their"
2795,II.,own right and are carefully set down in Homeric geography. Ogygia is
2796,II.,"the product of Ulysses himself, and so he goes thither to the reality."
2797,II.,The misfortunes in these lands are the very deeds of the offenders
2798,II.,"returning upon them. As the Gods are both subjective and objective, so"
2799,II.,are these poetic places and persons; they are both in Ulysses and
2800,II.,"outside of him, they are the inner change of the individual and the"
2801,II.,"outer development of the world. Each, however, fits into the other, is"
2802,II.,inseparably intertwined with the other; both together form the double
2803,II.,movement which is the fundamental structural fact of the present
2804,II.,division of the Odyssey.
2805,II.,
2806,II.,Of course our unfolding of the subject must follow the movement of the
2807,II.,"poem, but we shall not neglect the movement of the individual."
2808,II.,"Accordingly Calypso's Island, Ogygia, is the realm which is to be first"
2809,II.,considered.

2814,_BOOK FIFTH._,_BOOK FIFTH._
2815,_BOOK FIFTH._,
2816,_BOOK FIFTH._,
2817,_BOOK FIFTH._,"In this Book the reader will observe two distinct parts, which are so"
2818,_BOOK FIFTH._,often found in Homer and constitute the deepest distinction in his
2819,_BOOK FIFTH._,poems: these two parts are the Upper World of the Gods and the Lower
2820,_BOOK FIFTH._,"World of Man, both of which are shown in action and counteraction. The"
2821,_BOOK FIFTH._,grand dualism between the mortal and the immortal is fused into a
2822,_BOOK FIFTH._,living narrative and makes the warp and woof of Homeric poesy. The
2823,_BOOK FIFTH._,general purport of both parts is seen to be the same at bottom: it is
2824,_BOOK FIFTH._,to remove the obstacles which stand in the way of the Return of Ulysses
2825,_BOOK FIFTH._,to home and country. These obstacles arise from the Gods above and from
2826,_BOOK FIFTH._,"Nature below--the divine and the physical, though the latter also is"
2827,_BOOK FIFTH._,"presided over by deities. Thus the Greek hero, with the aid of the"
2828,_BOOK FIFTH._,"higher Gods, is to put down the lower ones, or convert them into aids"
2829,_BOOK FIFTH._,"for his advancement towards the grand end, which is his institutional"
2830,_BOOK FIFTH._,"life in Family and State. In this way only can Ulysses, from his"
2831,_BOOK FIFTH._,"alienation, attain unto harmony with himself and with the Divine Order."
2832,_BOOK FIFTH._,
2833,_BOOK FIFTH._,The first part of the Book gives the Council of the Gods and its
2834,_BOOK FIFTH._,consequences reaching down to the mortal who is the subject of
2835,_BOOK FIFTH._,deliberation. We shall note three stages in this movement from Olympus
2836,_BOOK FIFTH._,"to Earth: (1) Zeus to Hermes, (2) Hermes to Calypso, (3) Calypso to"
2837,_BOOK FIFTH._,Ulysses. Thus from the highest the decree is brought below and opens
2838,_BOOK FIFTH._,the providential way.
2839,_BOOK FIFTH._,
2840,_BOOK FIFTH._,"The second part deals with the mortal, who is brought into relation"
2841,_BOOK FIFTH._,"with three Gods, all representing phases of the physical element of"
2842,_BOOK FIFTH._,"water: (1) Neptune, the great deity of the sea, (2) Ino Leucothea, a"
2843,_BOOK FIFTH._,"lesser deity of the same, (3) the River-God, through whose channel"
2844,_BOOK FIFTH._,Ulysses comes at last to land. It is manifest that he must rise beyond
2845,_BOOK FIFTH._,"these water-divinities with their uncertain fluctuating element, and"
2846,_BOOK FIFTH._,"attain to the fixed earth with its life, ere he can find repose. We"
2847,_BOOK FIFTH._,shall now develop these two parts of the Book with their subdivisions
2848,_BOOK FIFTH._,in the order stated above.
2849,_BOOK FIFTH._,
2850,_BOOK FIFTH._,
2851,I.,I.
2852,I.,
2853,I.,"First then is the divine obstacle, which has to be removed by the Gods"
2854,I.,"in Homer, when the individual is ready to have it removed. This"
2855,I.,"obstacle is at present centered in the Goddess Calypso, the marvelous"
2856,I.,concealer and extinguisher of the Hero in her island Ogygia. Neptune is
2857,I.,"not here spoken of, though his element, the sea, is mentioned as"
2858,I.,something which must also be met and transcended; the Hero through his
2859,I.,own will can surmount this difficulty. Verily Calypso is the grand
2860,I.,"spiritual hindrance of Ulysses, and, to help him get rid of it, the"
2861,I.,"Olympians assemble and start the movement, the conditions being that he"
2862,I.,is internally prepared to be helped by the Gods. Of the latter fact we
2863,I.,shall note a number of indications hereafter.
2864,I.,
2865,I.,Of this divine activity in removing the first obstacle we may
2866,I.,distinguish three phases:--
2867,I.,
2868,I.,"1. The council of the Gods on Olympus under the presidency of Zeus, and"
2869,I.,the decree there.
2870,I.,
2871,I.,"2. Hermes is sent by the supreme deity to Calypso, with the decree."
2872,I.,
2873,I.,"3. Calypso imparts the decree to Ulysses, who soon sets about doing his"
2874,I.,part.
2875,I.,
2876,I.,In this brief outline we see the descent of the divine influence from
2877,I.,"Zeus the Highest, through Hermes messenger of the Gods, to Calypso, a"
2878,I.,"local subordinate deity, down to the mortal Ulysses who is to get the"
2879,I.,benefit thereof. Thus the poet makes his world-order ready for the deed
2880,I.,"of the man, who is now to act with all the energy of his being, and not"
2881,I.,lie back expecting the Gods to do everything for him. Such is the
2882,I.,"situation between the divine and human sides, of which we shall"
2883,I.,elaborate the former a little more fully.
2884,I.,
2885,I.,"1. The council of the Gods in which the matter is now discussed, seems"
2886,I.,somewhat like a repetition of the one at the beginning of the First
2887,I.,"Book, which indeed starts the whole poem. At present we may suppose"
2888,I.,that the poet wishes to recall that first council and its decree to the
2889,I.,"mind of the reader, inasmuch as the latter is now to begin the second"
2890,I.,"grand division of the poem, the Odyssey proper, or Return of Ulysses."
2891,I.,
2892,I.,Pallas takes up the complaint and arraigns Providence on an ethical
2893,I.,ground: the good king is forgotten and the good man suffers. To the
2894,I.,"face of the Supreme Ruler she draws the conclusion: ""Let not any"
2895,I.,"sceptered king henceforth be kind to his people and recognize justice,"
2896,I.,"but always let him be harsh and work unrighteousness."" Then she cites"
2897,I.,the unhappy lot of Ulysses. But Zeus throws the charge back upon
2898,I.,"Pallas, for she already had laid the divine plan that Ulysses was to"
2899,I.,"take vengeance on wrong-doing suitors, and Telemachus she could save"
2900,I.,"""by her skill,"" if so she chose. Here Pallas again hints as she did in"
2901,I.,"the First Book, the two lines on which the poem moves (Telemachus and"
2902,I.,"Ulysses), and she also notes the two present obstacles (Calypso and the"
2903,I.,sea) in the way of the Return of Ulysses.
2904,I.,
2905,I.,The divine activity begins work at once: Zeus sends Hermes to Calypso
2906,I.,"with the Olympian decree. Ulysses, however, is to reach home ""without"
2907,I.,"any escort of the Gods or of mortal men;"" that is, he must exercise his"
2908,I.,"own free-will tremendously, there is to be no special intervention of"
2909,I.,the Gods without the corresponding human effort. Note this passage as
2910,I.,indicating the consciousness of the poet respecting divine help; it is
2911,I.,"not to take the place of free agency, but to complement the same. The"
2912,I.,"Hero will have to sail on a raft, ""suffering evils;"" but he will reach"
2913,I.,"""the land of the Phæacians, near of kin to the Gods,"" where he will be"
2914,I.,"""honored as a God,"" and will be sent home with abounding wealth, ""more"
2915,I.,"than he would ever have received at Troy, returning unharmed with his"
2916,I.,"share of the booty."" Such is the promise of the world-governor to the"
2917,I.,self-reliant man; this promise is not fate but foresight on the part of
2918,I.,"the Supreme God. ""Thus is the Hero destined to see again his friends,"""
2919,I.,"namely by means of a small raft or float, which he alone must control"
2920,I.,"in his own strength, without the help of God or man. Such is the reward"
2921,I.,"of heroic endeavor, proclaimed by Zeus himself."
2922,I.,
2923,I.,"2. The messenger Hermes begins his flight down to Calypso, holding his"
2924,I.,"magic wand, with which he puts men to sleep or wakens them, imparting"
2925,I.,the power of vision or taking it away. He reaches the wonderful island
2926,I.,"with its grot, the account of which has been a master-stroke in"
2927,I.,"literature, and shows that the description of nature was not alien to"
2928,I.,"the Greek poet, though he rarely indulges in it. One thinks that the"
2929,I.,passage contains a suggestion of much modern writing of the kind.
2930,I.,
2931,I.,"It is to be noted that this island is mostly a wild product, it has had"
2932,I.,very little training from its resident. A natural house and garden we
2933,I.,"see it to be in the main; the senses, especially sight and smell, are"
2934,I.,gratified immediately by physical objects. There is little indication
2935,I.,"of Art, possibly a beginning in the singing and weaving; rude nature"
2936,I.,may have been transformed somewhat in the four fountains and in the
2937,I.,"trailing grape-vine. But this description is not made for its own sake,"
2938,I.,as are many modern descriptions of nature; the whole is the true
2939,I.,"environment for Calypso, and suggests her character."
2940,I.,
2941,I.,"Her name means the concealer, concealed herself in that lone sea-closed"
2942,I.,"island, and concealing others. Undeveloped she is, like nature, yet"
2943,I.,"beautiful; sunken still in the life of the senses, she dwells in her"
2944,I.,little paradise without any inner scission. But it must be recollected
2945,I.,"that Ulysses is not native to the island, he has come or rather fallen"
2946,I.,"hither, from a higher condition. He, therefore, has the scission in"
2947,I.,"himself, he longs to leave and be restored out of this realm of mere"
2948,I.,nature.
2949,I.,
2950,I.,"With such a longing the Gods must coincide, for they are the Gods of"
2951,I.,"culture, of the rise out of the physical. The long Journey of Hermes"
2952,I.,hints the distance between Olympus and Calypso's isle--a distance which
2953,I.,has its spiritual counterpart. The command of the Olympians is borne to
2954,I.,this lower Goddess; Hermes is the voice of the higher ethical divinity
2955,I.,to the lower one of mere nature. But even the higher God has his
2956,I.,"physical counterpart, is not yet wholly a spirit; so Hermes eats his"
2957,I.,ambrosia and drinks his nectar set before him by Calypso in true Greek
2958,I.,fashion and misses the smoke of sacrifices along his barren route.
2959,I.,
2960,I.,"It is curious to see how Hermes plays with polytheism, hinting ever so"
2961,I.,"slyly the contradiction in the Greek Pantheon. ""Why dost thou a God ask"
2962,I.,"me a God why I come?"" It is indeed an absurd question, for a God ought"
2963,I.,to know in advance. In numerous places we can trace a subtle Homeric
2964,I.,"humor which crops out in dealing with his many deities, indicating a"
2965,I.,start toward their dissolution. Then with a strong assertion of the
2966,I.,"supremacy of one God, Zeus, Hermes utters the unwilling word: Ulysses"
2967,I.,must depart from this island.
2968,I.,
2969,I.,"The answer of Calypso is significant, she charges the Gods with"
2970,I.,"jealousy; ""Ye grudge the Goddesses openly to mate with men,"" which"
2971,I.,proposition she nails by several examples. But the Gods reserve to
2972,I.,themselves the privilege of license with mortal women. A complaint
2973,I.,"still heard, not in the Olympian but in our Lower World; men are not"
2974,I.,held to the same code of morals that women are! But Calypso yields up
2975,I.,"her lover whom she ""thought to make immortal and ageless."" What else"
2976,I.,can she do? It is true that she saved him once and has preserved him
2977,I.,"till the present; she is, however, but a stage which must now be"
2978,I.,"transcended. Appetite may preserve man, still he is to rise above"
2979,I.,appetite.
2980,I.,
2981,I.,"3. Now Ulysses is brought before us. The first fact about him is, his"
2982,I.,"intense longing to return home; he is found ""sitting on the shore, and"
2983,I.,"his eyes were never dry of tears"" as he looked out on the sea toward"
2984,I.,"his country; ""for the nymph was no longer pleasing to him,"" whatever"
2985,I.,may have been the case once. Surely the hero is in bonds which he
2986,I.,"cannot break, though he would; a penitential strand we may well find in"
2987,I.,his sorrow; thus he is ready for release.
2988,I.,
2989,I.,"Calypso, therefore, announces to him the divine plan: he must make a"
2990,I.,"raft and commit himself to the waters. She has to obey, for is she not"
2991,I.,really conquered by Ulysses? Certainly the divine order requires her to
2992,I.,send the man away from her island. Yet the return is by no means made
2993,I.,"easy, but is to be won by hardest effort; he must grapple with the"
2994,I.,"waves, with angry Neptune after leaving Calypso. No wonder that Ulysses"
2995,I.,shuddered at the proposition; truly he has the choice between the devil
2996,I.,"and the deep sea, and he manfully chooses the latter. First, however,"
2997,I.,"the Goddess has to take the great oath ""by Earth, by Heaven above and"
2998,I.,"Styx below,"" the sum total of the physical universe, from whose"
2999,I.,"presence the perjurer cannot escape, though a God, that she is not"
3000,I.,practicing any hidden guile against her much-desired guest. Always the
3001,I.,"doubter, the skeptic Ulysses will show himself, even toward a divinity."
3002,I.,"He must test the Gods also, as well as man. Very beautiful and humane"
3003,I.,"is the answer of the Goddess: ""Such things I plan and deliberate for"
3004,I.,"thee as I would devise for myself, were I in so great straits. For I"
3005,I.,"too have a righteous mind, and the heart within my breast is not of"
3006,I.,"iron, but compassionate."""
3007,I.,
3008,I.,Has a change come over the Goddess through this visit from Olympus?
3009,I.,"Hardly could she have felt this before, else she would have sent away"
3010,I.,Ulysses of her own accord. Her adjustment to the divine decree seems
3011,I.,"now to be internal, and not simply a yielding to an external power."
3012,I.,"Still the separation costs her deep pangs, and she wonders how Ulysses,"
3013,I.,"a mortal, can give her up, who is immortal, with all her beauty and the"
3014,I.,pleasures of her paradise.
3015,I.,
3016,I.,The answer of Ulysses reveals the man in his present stale of mind. He
3017,I.,"recognizes Calypso as beautiful, deathless, ever young; still he must"
3018,I.,have something more than sensuous life and beauty; though it last
3019,I.,"forever, it can never satisfy. Not to be compared with the Goddess in"
3020,I.,"grace and stature, is his wife Penelope, still he longs for his home;"
3021,I.,"""yea, though some God wreck me on the wine-dark deep, I shall endure."""
3022,I.,But there is no doubt the other side is also present in Ulysses; he has
3023,I.,"within himself a strong sensuous nature with which is the battle, and"
3024,I.,"the poem does not disguise the matter, for he is again ready to enjoy"
3025,I.,"all the pleasures of Calypso's bower, after this paroxysm of"
3026,I.,home-sickness.
3027,I.,
3028,I.,"Such is the deep struggle of the man; such is also the divine obstacle,"
3029,I.,which has to be removed by an Olympian interference before he can
3030,I.,return. We see that Ulysses in spite of all blandishments of the
3031,I.,"Goddess and momentary weakness of himself, was ready for its removal;"
3032,I.,"in his heart he has overcome Calypso, and wishes to get back to his"
3033,I.,"institutional life in Family and State. Such a man must return, the"
3034,I.,"Gods must be on his side, else they are not Gods. According to the"
3035,I.,"Greek conception, Calypso is a subordinate deity who must be put down"
3036,I.,"by the Olympians; appetite is not a devil, but a lower good, which must"
3037,I.,"be adjusted to the higher. Note, then, that the external stream, or the"
3038,I.,"world-movement represented by the Gods, now unites with the internal"
3039,I.,"stream, the spirit of the individual, and brings forth the great event."
3040,I.,"As stated often before, these two streams run through all Homeric"
3041,I.,poetry.
3042,I.,
3043,I.,"Ulysses now makes his raft; the hero is also a ship-builder, being the"
3044,I.,"self-sufficient man, equal to any emergency, in whom lie all"
3045,I.,"possibilities. The boat, still quite primitive, is constructed before"
3046,I.,"our eyes; It is the weapon for conquering Neptune, and prophesies"
3047,I.,"navigation. Calypso aids him in every way, she even supplies him with"
3048,I.,"tools, the axe, the adze, the augur, which imply a more advanced state"
3049,I.,of civilization than has hitherto appeared in the Dark Island. Whence
3050,I.,did she obtain them? No special answer is given; hence we are thrown
3051,I.,back upon a general answer. Calypso is the original wild state of
3052,I.,"nature; but her transformation has begun, she helps Ulysses in her new"
3053,I.,character. These tools are themselves formed from nature into means for
3054,I.,subduing nature; the instrument of bronze in the hands of the
3055,I.,wood-cutter is the master of the tree. At present Calypso is also such
3056,I.,"an instrument; she, the wild product of nature, is herself transformed"
3057,I.,into a means for helping Ulysses conquer the mighty physical element
3058,I.,before him; an implement she has become in the hand of the Gods for
3059,I.,"restoring the heroic endurer, and hence she can emblematically hand him"
3060,I.,"these material implements, for they are one with her present spirit."
3061,I.,"Indeed we may carry the analogy one step further, turning it inwardly:"
3062,I.,"Calypso, though once the inciter to sensuous desire, now helps the man"
3063,I.,put it away and flee from it; ethically she is converted into an
3064,I.,instrument against her former self. In like manner nature is turned
3065,I.,against nature by the thinking artificer.
3066,I.,
3067,I.,Also food and drink and raiment the Island Goddess furnishes for the
3068,I.,voyage; with rare skill she tells him how to direct his course by the
3069,I.,"stars; she is mistress over the winds, it seems, for she sends the"
3070,I.,right one to blow. Wonderful indeed is the change; all those forces of
3071,I.,"nature, formerly so hostile, have been transformed into helpers,"
3072,I.,Calypso herself being also transformed. Thus we catch the outlines of
3073,I.,"the Fairy Tale or marvelous story, which tells, in a supernatural way,"
3074,I.,"of man's mastery of the physical world, once so destructive, now so"
3075,I.,obedient.
3076,I.,
3077,I.,"Cloth for his sails she brought him, but we must recollect that she was"
3078,I.,a weaver at the start of the story. At last Ulysses pushes his raft
3079,I.,"down into the fair salt sea; Ogygia, the place of nature's luxuriance"
3080,I.,"and delight, is left behind; he must quit the natural state, however"
3081,I.,"paradisaical, and pass to the social order, to Ithaca, though the"
3082,I.,latter be poor and rocky. Still we may well recall the fact that the
3083,I.,"island and Calypso once saved Ulysses, when wrecked elsewhere, on"
3084,I.,account of the slaughter done to the Oxen of the Sun; this wild spot
3085,I.,"furnished him natural shelter, food, gratification; nay, it gave him"
3086,I.,love.
3087,I.,
3088,I.,"To be sure, the other side is not to be forgotten: it had to be"
3089,I.,"transcended, when it kept him away from the higher institutional life."
3090,I.,"Ulysses, the wonderful, limit-transcending spirit, unfolds within even"
3091,I.,"while caught in this wild jungle; he evolves out of it, as man has"
3092,I.,"evolved out of it, thus he hints the movement of his race, which has to"
3093,I.,quit a cave-life and a mere sensuous existence. Such is the decree of
3094,I.,"the Gods, for all time: the man must abandon Calypso, who is herself to"
3095,I.,be transformed into an instrument of his progress.
3096,I.,
3097,I.,"We may now begin to see what Calypso means, in outline at least. The"
3098,I.,difficulty of comprehending her lies in her twofold character: at one
3099,I.,"time she is nature, then she is the helper against nature. But just"
3100,I.,"therein is her movement, her development. She is Goddess of this"
3101,I.,"Island, where she rules; but she is a lesser deity who has to be"
3102,I.,"subordinated to the Olympians, as nature must be put under spirit. The"
3103,I.,"Greek deified nature, not being able to diabolize it; still he knew"
3104,I.,that it must be ruled and transmuted by mind. Thus Calypso is a
3105,I.,"Goddess, inferior, confined to one locality, but having sensuous beauty"
3106,I.,"as nature has. She, without ethical content, as purely physical, stands"
3107,I.,"in the way of institutions, notably the Family; she seduces the man,"
3108,I.,"and holds him by his senses, by his passion, till he rise out of her"
3109,I.,sway. On this side her significance is plain: she is the female
3110,I.,"principle which stands between Ulysses and his wedded wife, she not"
3111,I.,"being wedded. Thus she is an embodiment of nature, from the external"
3112,I.,"landscape in which she is set, to internal impulse, to the element of"
3113,I.,"sex. So it comes that she is represented as a beautiful woman, but"
3114,I.,beauty without its ethical content can no longer chain Ulysses. That
3115,I.,"charm is broken, in spite of passing relapses."
3116,I.,
3117,I.,"Then comes the other side of Calypso's character, as already indicated:"
3118,I.,"she changes, she turns and helps Ulysses put down herself and get away"
3119,I.,"from her world, furnishing him quite all the means for his voyage. Not"
3120,I.,without a certain regret and parting display of her charms does she do
3121,I.,"this; still the change is real, and at the last stage we must imagine a"
3122,I.,Calypso transformed or partially so.
3123,I.,
3124,I.,The enchantress on her magic island is a favorite theme with the Fairy
3125,I.,"Tale, and the situation in itself rouses curiosity and wonder. The bit"
3126,I.,"of land floating on the sea in appearance, yet withstanding wave and"
3127,I.,"tempest, is, to the sailor, the home of supernatural beings. The story"
3128,I.,of Calypso has the tinge of nautical fancy. In like manner the story of
3129,I.,Robinson Crusoe is that of a sea-faring people. We see in it the
3130,I.,"ship-wrecked man, the lone island, the struggle with nature for food"
3131,I.,and shelter. But Defoe has no supernatural realm playing into his
3132,I.,"narrative--no beautiful nymph, no Olympian Gods. That twofold Homeric"
3133,I.,"conception of an Upper and Lower World, of a human and divine element"
3134,I.,"in the great experience, is lost; the Englishman is practical,"
3135,I.,"realistic, utilitarian even in his pious observations, which he flings"
3136,I.,into his text from the outside at given intervals.
3137,I.,
3138,I.,"Ogygia, the abode of Calypso, means the Dark Island, upon which Ulysses"
3139,I.,"is cast after the destruction of the Oxen of the Sun. Calypso, in"
3140,I.,"harmony with the name of her abode, signifies the concealer--and that"
3141,I.,"is what has happened to Ulysses, his light is hidden. She is the"
3142,I.,"daughter of Atlas, who has two mental traits assigned to him; he is"
3143,I.,evil-minded and he knows all the depths of the sea. A demonic being
3144,I.,endowed with his dark knowledge of things out of sight; he has a third
3145,I.,"trait also, ""he upholds of himself the long pillars which keep Heaven"
3146,I.,"and Earth apart"" (Book I. 53). Naturally under such a burden he is not"
3147,I.,"in good humor. Calypso is the daughter who, along with her grot, may be"
3148,I.,"conceived to have risen out of the obscure depths of the sea, with"
3149,I.,something of her father's disposition. Doubtless Greek sailors could
3150,I.,behold in her image the dangerous rocks which lurked unseen beneath the
3151,I.,waters around her island. The comparative mythologist finds in her tale
3152,I.,the clouds obscuring or concealing the Sun (here Ulysses) till the
3153,I.,luminary breaks out of his concealment and shines in native glory.
3154,I.,"Something of truth lies in these various views, but the fundamental"
3155,I.,"meaning is not physical, but ethical."
3156,I.,
3157,I.,
3158,II.,II.
3159,II.,
3160,II.,We now come to the great physical obstacle standing in the way of the
3161,II.,"Return of Ulysses, the sea, which, however, has always its divine side"
3162,II.,to the Greek mind. A series of water-deities will rise before us out of
3163,II.,"this mighty element, assuming various attitudes toward the solitary"
3164,II.,"voyager. Three of them, showing themselves as hostile (Neptune), as"
3165,II.,"helpful (Ino Leucothea), as saving (the River-God); all three too seem"
3166,II.,"in a kind of gradation, from the vast total sea, through one of its"
3167,II.,"phases, to the small stream pouring into the sea from the land. Thus"
3168,II.,"the Greek imagination, playing with water, deified the various"
3169,II.,"appearances thereof, specially in their relation to man. The"
3170,II.,introduction of these three marine divinities naturally organizes this
3171,II.,second part of the Fifth Book into three phases or stages. Such is the
3172,II.,divine side now to be witnessed.
3173,II.,
3174,II.,"Parallel to this runs the human side, represented by the lone hero"
3175,II.,"Ulysses, who is passing through a fearful ordeal of danger with its"
3176,II.,"attendant emotions of anxiety, terror, hope, despair. A very hard test"
3177,II.,is surely here applied to weak mortal flesh. We shall observe that he
3178,II.,passes through a series of mental perturbations at each divine
3179,II.,"appearance; he runs up and down a scale of doubt, complaint,"
3180,II.,"resolution. His weakness he will show, yet also his strength;"
3181,II.,"dubitation yet faith; he will hesitate, yet finally act. Thus he saves"
3182,II.,"himself at last through his own will, yet certainly with the help of"
3183,II.,the Gods; for both sides have to co-operate to bring about the heroic
3184,II.,act of his deliverance.
3185,II.,
3186,II.,"Pallas also comes to the aid of her favorite, but in an indirect"
3187,II.,manner. The sea does not seem to be her element. She stops the winds
3188,II.,"and ""informs his mind with forecast,"" but she does not personally"
3189,II.,"appear and speak, nor is she addressed, as is the case with the"
3190,II.,water-gods. She plays in by the way in this marine emergency; her
3191,II.,appearances now do not organize the action. But the three appearances
3192,II.,"of the water-gods are the organic principle, their element being at"
3193,II.,present the scene of the adventure. On these lines we shall note the
3194,II.,course of the poem in some detail.
3195,II.,
3196,II.,"1. Neptune returning from the Ethiopians to Hellas, sees the lone"
3197,II.,sailor with his little craft from the heights of the mountain called
3198,II.,"Solyma; at once the God's wrath is roused and he talks to himself,"
3199,II.,"""shaking his head."" The clouds, the winds, the ocean obeyed his behest,"
3200,II.,and fell upon the voyager in a furious tempest. A huge billow whirled
3201,II.,the raft around and threw Ulysses off into the deep; with difficulty be
3202,II.,"regained his place, and escaped death."
3203,II.,
3204,II.,"A vivid picture of the grand obstacle to early navigation, of which"
3205,II.,Neptune is the embodiment. Why should he not be angry at the man who
3206,II.,seeks to tame him? The raft means his ultimate subjection. Nature
3207,II.,"resists the hand which subdues her at first, and then gracefully"
3208,II.,yields. To be sure there had to be a mythical ground for Neptune's
3209,II.,"anger at Ulysses: the latter had put out the eye of his son, the"
3210,II.,"Cyclops Polyphemus, which was another phase of the subjection of wild"
3211,II.,"nature to intelligence. For seventeen days Ulysses had easy sailing,"
3212,II.,guided by the stars; but the sea has its destructive side which must
3213,II.,also be experienced by the much-enduring man.
3214,II.,
3215,II.,"Corresponding to this outer tempest, we observe an inner tempest in the"
3216,II.,"soul of Ulysses. ""O me wretched! what is now to happen to me!"" Terror"
3217,II.,"unmans him for the time being; regret weakens him: ""Thrice happy, four"
3218,II.,"times happy the Greeks who fell on Troy's broad plain!"" Thus he goes"
3219,II.,back in memory to his heroic epoch and wishes for death then. Too late
3220,II.,"it is, for while he is lamenting, a wave strikes him and tosses him out"
3221,II.,"into the deep; now he has to act, and this need of action saves him"
3222,II.,"from his internal trituration, as well as from external death."
3223,II.,
3224,II.,"With this renewed energy of the will, a new help appears, a divine aid"
3225,II.,"from the sea. For without his own strong effort, no God can rescue him,"
3226,II.,however powerful. That toss out into the waves was not without its
3227,II.,blessing.
3228,II.,
3229,II.,"2. Ino Leucothea, Ino the white Goddess, beholds him with pity in his"
3230,II.,extremity--she was once mortal herself but now is divine. Her function
3231,II.,seems to be to help the shipwrecked mariner; her name reminds the
3232,II.,"reader of the white calm of the sea, elsewhere celebrated by Homer"
3233,II.,"(Book X, 94; Nitzsch's observation). Thus she appears to represent the"
3234,II.,"peaceful placid mood of the marine element, which rises in the midst of"
3235,II.,"the storm and imparts hope and courage, nay predicts safety. She gives"
3236,II.,"her veil to Ulysses, in which commentators trace a suggestion of the"
3237,II.,"fillet or sacred cloth which was given out from a temple in Samothrace,"
3238,II.,"and had the power of saving the endangered mariner, if he had tied it"
3239,II.,"round his body. As it is here employed, it strangely suggests a"
3240,II.,life-preserver. At any rate Ino is the calming power opposed to angry
3241,II.,"Neptune, and she works upon both the waters and the man."
3242,II.,
3243,II.,"""Ill-fated man,"" she cries, ""why hast thou so angered Neptune?"" Then"
3244,II.,"she changes her note: ""Still he shall not destroy thee, however much he"
3245,II.,"desires."" She bids him give up his raft to the anger of Neptune, throw"
3246,II.,"away his clinging wet garments of Calypso, and swim to the land of the"
3247,II.,"Phæacians. Then she hands him the veil which he is to ""bind beneath his"
3248,II.,"breast,"" and, when he has reached land, he is to throw it back into the"
3249,II.,"sea. A ritual of some kind, symbolic acts we feel these to be, though"
3250,II.,"their exact meaning may be doubtful. Ino, ""the daughter of Cadmus,"" is"
3251,II.,"supposed to have been a Phoenician Goddess originally, and to have"
3252,II.,"been transferred to the Greek sailor, just as his navigation came to"
3253,II.,"him, partly at least, from the Phoenicians. If he girded himself with"
3254,II.,"the consecrated veil of Leucothea, the Goddess of the calm, Neptune"
3255,II.,himself in wrath could not sink him.
3256,II.,
3257,II.,"Such was the faith required of Ulysses, but now comes the internal"
3258,II.,"counterstroke: his skepticism. ""Ah me! what if some God is planning"
3259,II.,"another fraud against me, bidding me quit my raft!"" The doubter refuses"
3260,II.,to obey and clings to his raft. But the waves make short work of it
3261,II.,"now, and Ulysses by sheer necessity has to do as the Goddess bade him;"
3262,II.,"""with hands outspread he plunged into the sea,"" the veil being"
3263,II.,"underneath him. When he quits his raft, and is seen in the water,"
3264,II.,"Neptune dismisses him from view with a parting execration, and Pallas"
3265,II.,"begins to help him, not openly, but indirectly."
3266,II.,
3267,II.,"In such manner the great doubter is getting toward shore, but even here"
3268,II.,"his doubts cease not. Steep jutting cliffs may not permit him to land,"
3269,II.,"the billows may dash him to death on the sharp shoaly rocks, or carry"
3270,II.,"him out again to sea, or some huge monster of the deep may snap him up"
3271,II.,"in its jaws; thus he is dashed about internally, on the billows of"
3272,II.,doubt. But this grinding within is stopped by the grinding he gets
3273,II.,"without; a mighty surge overwhelms him, he clutches a rock and saves"
3274,II.,"himself, but leaves flakes of flesh from his hands behind on the rock."
3275,II.,"""He swam along the coast and eyed it well,"" he even reaches the mouth"
3276,II.,"of a soft-flowing river, where was a smooth beach and a shelter from"
3277,II.,"the wind. Here is the spot so long desired, here then he passes to an"
3278,II.,"act of faith, he prays to the river which becomes at once to the Greek"
3279,II.,imagination a God.
3280,II.,
3281,II.,"3. This brings us to the third water deity, and we observe a kind of"
3282,II.,"scale from the universal one, Neptune, down to a local one, that of the"
3283,II.,"river. The middle one, Ino, is the humane kindly phase of the great"
3284,II.,"deep, showing her kinship with man; Neptune was the ruder god of the"
3285,II.,"physical sea, and, to the Homeric Greek, the most powerful and natural."
3286,II.,No wonder that he was angry at that little raft and its builder; it
3287,II.,meant his ultimate subjection.
3288,II.,
3289,II.,"The prayer of Ulysses to the River-God is, on the whole, the finest"
3290,II.,"passage in the present Book. It shows him now a man of faith, humbled"
3291,II.,"though he be to the last degree of misery: ""Hear me, ruler, whoever"
3292,II.,"thou art, I approach thee much-besought. The deathless Gods revere the"
3293,II.,"prayer of him who comes to them and asks for mercy, as I now come to"
3294,II.,"thy stream. Pity, ruler, me thy suppliant."" Certainly a lofty"
3295,II.,recognition of the true nature of deity; no wonder that the River
3296,II.,"stayed his current, smoothed the waves and made a calm before him. Such"
3297,II.,a view of the Gods reveals to us the inner depths of the Hero's
3298,II.,character; it calls to mind that speech of Phoenix in the Iliad (Book
3299,II.,Ninth) where he says that the Gods are placable. As soon as Ulysses
3300,II.,"makes this utterance from his heart, he is saved, the Divine Order is"
3301,II.,"adjusted to his prayer, he having of course put himself into harmony"
3302,II.,with the same. He has no longer any need of the protecting veil of the
3303,II.,"sea-goddess Ino, having escaped from the angry element, and obtained"
3304,II.,the help of the new deity belonging to the place. He restores the veil
3305,II.,"to the Goddess according to her request, in which symbolic act we may"
3306,II.,"possibly read a consecration of the object which had saved him, as well"
3307,II.,"as a recognition of the deity: ""This veil of salvation belongs not to"
3308,II.,"me, but to the Goddess."" Not of his strength alone was he saved from"
3309,II.,the waves.
3310,II.,
3311,II.,"Such is one side of Ulysses, that of faith, of the manifestation of the"
3312,II.,"godlike in man, especially when he is in the very pinch of destruction."
3313,II.,"But Ulysses would not be Ulysses, unless he showed the other side too,"
3314,II.,"that of unfaith, weak complaint, and temporary irresolution. So, when"
3315,II.,"he is safe on the bank of the stream, he begins to cry out: ""What now"
3316,II.,am I to suffer more! If I try to sleep on this river's brink for the
3317,II.,"night, the frost and dew and wind will kill me; and if I climb this"
3318,II.,"hill to yonder thicket, I fear a savage beast will eat me while I"
3319,II.,"slumber."" It is well to be careful, O Ulysses, in these wild solitudes;"
3320,II.,"now let the petulant outburst just given, be preparatory to an act of"
3321,II.,"will which will settle the problem. ""He rose and went to the wood near"
3322,II.,"by; he crept under two bushes that grew from the same place, one the"
3323,II.,"wild and the other the tame olive."" There in a heap of leaves--man's"
3324,II.,first bed--he slept under the intertwined branches of the two
3325,II.,"olives--nature's shelter against wind, rain, sun. He, with all his"
3326,II.,cultivation is quite reduced to the condition of the primitive man.
3327,II.,
3328,II.,"One cannot help feeling a symbolic intention in these two olive trees,"
3329,II.,one wild and one cultivated. They represent in a degree the two phases
3330,II.,of the man sleeping under them; they hint also the transition which he
3331,II.,is making from the untamed nature of Calypso's island to the more
3332,II.,civilized land of Phæacia. The whole Book is indeed the movement to a
3333,II.,new life and a new country. We might carry out the symbolic hint much
3334,II.,"further on these lines, and see a meaning in their interwoven branches"
3335,II.,and the protection they are giving at present; but the poetic
3336,II.,suggestion flashing afar over poem backwards and forwards is the true
3337,II.,"effect, and may be dimmed by too much explanation."
3338,II.,
3339,II.,"Such is this marvelous storm with its ship-wreck, probably the first in"
3340,II.,"literature, but often made use of since. The outer surges of the"
3341,II.,"tempest are indeed terrific; but the main interest is, that along with"
3342,II.,"this external description of the storm, we witness the corresponding"
3343,II.,internal heaving and tossing of a human soul. Everywhere we notice that
3344,II.,"Ulysses doubts at first, doubts Calypso, doubts Ino, doubts even his"
3345,II.,"final safety when on land. He is the skeptical man, he never fails to"
3346,II.,call up the possibilities on the other side. Though a God give the
3347,II.,"promise, he knows that there are other Gods who do not promise, or may"
3348,II.,give a different promise to somebody else. It is the experience of
3349,II.,"life, this touch of doubt at first; it always accompanies the thinking"
3350,II.,"man, who, like Ulysses, must be aware of a negative counterpart even to"
3351,II.,"truth. Not pleasant, but painful is this doubt shooting through the"
3352,II.,"soul, and keeping it in distress and often in lamentation. So even the"
3353,II.,"Hero breaks out into unmanly complaint, and reveals to the full his"
3354,II.,finite nature.
3355,II.,
3356,II.,"Yet if Ulysses doubts, he always overcomes his doubt in the end; he"
3357,II.,sees the positive element in the world to be deeper than the negative
3358,II.,"one, after a little access of weakness. Under his doubt is the deeper"
3359,II.,"layer of faith, so he never gives up, but valiantly holds on and"
3360,II.,conquers. The Gods come to his aid when he believes and acts. His
3361,II.,"intellect is doubt, his will is faith: wherein we may trace important"
3362,II.,"lines which unite him with Faust, the chief character in our last"
3363,II.,"world-poem. Ulysses will complain, and having freed his mind, will go"
3364,II.,"to work and conquer the obstacle. He struggles with the billow,"
3365,II.,"clinging to the mast, though he had just said: ""Now I shall die a"
3366,II.,"miserable death."""
3367,II.,
3368,II.,"Parallel to this human side runs the divine side, which we need not"
3369,II.,"further describe here, with its three water-deities. A little attention"
3370,II.,we may give to the part of Pallas. At one time she seems to control the
3371,II.,"outer world for her favorite, sending the wind or stopping it; then she"
3372,II.,"is said to inform his mind with forecast, that he may do the thing in"
3373,II.,spite of wind or other obstacle; finally he often does the deed without
3374,II.,"any divine suggestion, acting through himself. In these stages we can"
3375,II.,"see a transition of the Mythus. The first stage is truly mythical, in"
3376,II.,"which the deity is the mover, the second is less so, the Goddess having"
3377,II.,become almost wholly internal; in the third stage the mythical is lost.
3378,II.,"All these stages are in Homer and in this Book, though the first is"
3379,II.,still paramount.
3380,II.,
3381,II.,Taking into view the general character of the mythical movement of this
3382,II.,"Fifth Book, we observe that there is a rise in it from a lower to a"
3383,II.,higher form; Calypso and Neptune are intimately blended with their
3384,II.,"physical environments, the island and the sea. Though elevated into"
3385,II.,"persons, they are still sunk in Nature; it is the function of the Hero,"
3386,II.,"especially the wise man, to subordinate both or to transcend both:"
3387,II.,"which is just what Ulysses has done. His Mythus is, therefore, a higher"
3388,II.,"one, telling the story of the subjection of nature and of her Gods."
3389,II.,This story marks one phase of his career.
3390,II.,
3391,II.,The reader will probably be impressed with the fact that in the present
3392,II.,Book the stress is upon the discipline of the will. The inner reactions
3393,II.,"of complaint, doubt, or despair turn against the deed, to which Ulysses"
3394,II.,has to nerve himself by a supreme act of volition. The world of Calypso
3395,II.,"is that of self-indulgence, inactivity, will-lessness, to which Ulysses"
3396,II.,"has sunk after his sin against the source of light, after his negation"
3397,II.,of all intelligence. It is not simply sensuous gratification with the
3398,II.,"mind still whole and capable of resolution, as was the case with"
3399,II.,"Ulysses in the realm of Circe, in which he shows his will-power, though"
3400,II.,coupled with indulgence. Such is the difference between Calypso and
3401,II.,"Circe, which is always a problem with the reader. In this way, too, we"
3402,II.,see how the Fifth Book before us is a direct continuation and unfolding
3403,II.,out of the Twelfth Book. Indeed the very movement of the poem is
3404,II.,"significant, which is a going backwards; so Ulysses drops far to the"
3405,II.,"rear out of that light-loving Island of the Sun, against which is his"
3406,II.,"violation, when he comes to Ogygia."
3407,II.,
3408,II.,"But Ulysses has now, after long discipline, transcended this sphere,"
3409,II.,"and has reached a new land, of which the account is to follow next."

3415,_BOOK SIXTH._,
3416,_BOOK SIXTH._,
3417,_BOOK SIXTH._,"We are now to make one of the chief transitions of the poem, we are"
3418,_BOOK SIXTH._,"going to pass from the Dark Island and the stormy sea to Phæacia, a"
3419,_BOOK SIXTH._,"bright, sunlit land, where reign peace and harmony. Moreover, we move"
3420,_BOOK SIXTH._,out of the realm of nature to that of institutions. Still more
3421,_BOOK SIXTH._,"significant are the central figures of the two localities, both women;"
3422,_BOOK SIXTH._,"one of these we have seen, Calypso, who is now to give way to Nausicaa."
3423,_BOOK SIXTH._,
3424,_BOOK SIXTH._,"This Book may, therefore, be called Nausicaa's Book, as she is the"
3425,_BOOK SIXTH._,"leading character in it, imparting to it a marvelous mood of idyllic"
3426,_BOOK SIXTH._,beauty and womanly purity. She is the person chosen by the poet to
3427,_BOOK SIXTH._,"introduce the Hero into the new realm, Phæacia, being in sharp contrast"
3428,_BOOK SIXTH._,"to Calypso, who detained Ulysses in dark Ogygia away from his family,"
3429,_BOOK SIXTH._,and whose character was adverse to the domestic relation. But Nausicaa
3430,_BOOK SIXTH._,shows from the start the primal instinct of the true woman for the
3431,_BOOK SIXTH._,"home. She is still young, but she has arrived at that age in which she"
3432,_BOOK SIXTH._,longs with every throb of her heart to surrender her own separate
3433,_BOOK SIXTH._,"existence, and to unite it with another. She manifests in all its"
3434,_BOOK SIXTH._,"attractiveness the primordial love of the woman for the Family, basis"
3435,_BOOK SIXTH._,"of all institutional life, as well as fountain of the deepest joys of"
3436,_BOOK SIXTH._,our terrestrial sojourn.
3437,_BOOK SIXTH._,
3438,_BOOK SIXTH._,On this account she represents the place of Phæacia in the Greek world
3439,_BOOK SIXTH._,"as well as in the present poem; perhaps we ought to add, in the whole"
3440,_BOOK SIXTH._,"movement of civilization. That land may be called the idyllic one, a"
3441,_BOOK SIXTH._,land of peace and of freedom from all struggle; the borderland between
3442,_BOOK SIXTH._,the natural and the civilized spheres. Man has risen out of the
3443,_BOOK SIXTH._,"grossness of mere sensuous individualism, such as we see in Polyphemus"
3444,_BOOK SIXTH._,and in other shapes of Fairyland; but he has not yet reached the
3445,_BOOK SIXTH._,conflicts of higher forms of society resulting from a pursuit of
3446,_BOOK SIXTH._,"wealth, from ambition, from war. Here is a quiet half-way house on the"
3447,_BOOK SIXTH._,"road from nature to civilization; a sweet reposeful realm, almost"
3448,_BOOK SIXTH._,without any development of the negative forces of society; a temporary
3449,_BOOK SIXTH._,"stopping-place for Ulysses in his all-embracing career, also for"
3450,_BOOK SIXTH._,individuals and nations in their rush forward to reach the great end.
3451,_BOOK SIXTH._,"The deep collisions of social life belong not to Phæacia, nor to"
3452,_BOOK SIXTH._,"Nausicaa, its ideal image."
3453,_BOOK SIXTH._,
3454,_BOOK SIXTH._,"It is the virgin land, the virgin world, which now has a young virgin"
3455,_BOOK SIXTH._,"as its central character and representative, to mediate Ulysses with"
3456,_BOOK SIXTH._,"itself, the universal man who must also have the new experience. Still"
3457,_BOOK SIXTH._,"she is not all of Phæacia, but its prelude, its introductory form;"
3458,_BOOK SIXTH._,"moreover, she is just the person to conduct Ulysses out of his present"
3459,_BOOK SIXTH._,"forlorn condition of mind and body into a young fresh hope, into a new"
3460,_BOOK SIXTH._,world. The Calypso life is to be obliterated by the vision of the true
3461,_BOOK SIXTH._,woman and her instinctive devotion to the Family. We are aware that
3462,_BOOK SIXTH._,"Ulysses has not been contented with the Dark Island and its nymph, he"
3463,_BOOK SIXTH._,has had the longing to get away and has at last gotten away; but to
3464,_BOOK SIXTH._,"what has he come? Lost the one and not attained the other, till he"
3465,_BOOK SIXTH._,"beholds Nausicaa, who grasps him by the hand, as it were, and delivers"
3466,_BOOK SIXTH._,"him wholly from Calypso, leading him forth to her home, where he is to"
3467,_BOOK SIXTH._,"witness the central phase of domestic life, the mother."
3468,_BOOK SIXTH._,
3469,_BOOK SIXTH._,"The organism of the Book easily falls into two parts, one of which"
3470,_BOOK SIXTH._,"portrays Nausicaa at home, the other gives the meeting between her and"
3471,_BOOK SIXTH._,"Ulysses. Yet over this human movement hovers always the divine, Pallas"
3472,_BOOK SIXTH._,"is the active supernal power which brings these events to pass,"
3473,_BOOK SIXTH._,introducing both the parts mentioned. She is the providence which the
3474,_BOOK SIXTH._,poet never permits to drop out. Most deeply does the old singer's
3475,_BOOK SIXTH._,"sincerity herein move the reader, who must rise to the same elevation;"
3476,_BOOK SIXTH._,"Homer's loyalty is to faith, faith in the Divine Order of the World,"
3477,_BOOK SIXTH._,for this is not suffered to go its way without a master spirit; the
3478,_BOOK SIXTH._,"individual, especially in his pivotal action, is never left alone, but"
3479,_BOOK SIXTH._,"he fits in somewhere; the Whole takes him up and directs him, and"
3480,_BOOK SIXTH._,adjusts him into the providential plan; not simply from without but
3481,_BOOK SIXTH._,"through himself. Such is this poet's loyalty to his Idea; he has faith,"
3482,_BOOK SIXTH._,"deep, genuine faith, yet unostentatious, quite unconventional at times;"
3483,_BOOK SIXTH._,"a most refreshing, yes, edifying appearance to-day, even for religious"
3484,_BOOK SIXTH._,"people, though he be ""an old heathen."""
3485,_BOOK SIXTH._,
3486,_BOOK SIXTH._,Such continual recurrence of the God's interference with the course of
3487,_BOOK SIXTH._,events--what does it mean? This is unquestionably the fundamental
3488,_BOOK SIXTH._,"problem with the earnest student of Homer. Let us observe, then, first,"
3489,_BOOK SIXTH._,that the poet's principle is not to allow a divine intervention to
3490,_BOOK SIXTH._,degenerate into a merely external mechanical act; himself full of the
3491,_BOOK SIXTH._,"spirit of the God, he puts the divine influence inside the individual"
3492,_BOOK SIXTH._,"as well as outside, and thus preserves the latter's freedom in the"
3493,_BOOK SIXTH._,providential order. The faithful reader will never let these movements
3494,_BOOK SIXTH._,"of the deity drop into mere machinery; when he does, he has lost the"
3495,_BOOK SIXTH._,essence of Homer. Doubtless it requires an alert activity of mind to
3496,_BOOK SIXTH._,hold the Gods always before the vision in their truth; they must be
3497,_BOOK SIXTH._,"re-thought, or indeed re-created every time they appear. The"
3498,_BOOK SIXTH._,somnolescent reader is only too ready to spare himself the poetic
3499,_BOOK SIXTH._,"exaltation in which the old bard must be read, if we would really see"
3500,_BOOK SIXTH._,"the divinities, and grasp the spirit of their dealings with man. Speak"
3501,_BOOK SIXTH._,"not, then, of epical machinery in Homer, the word is misleading to the"
3502,_BOOK SIXTH._,"last degree, is indeed libellous, belieing the poet in the very soul of"
3503,_BOOK SIXTH._,his art.
3504,_BOOK SIXTH._,
3505,_BOOK SIXTH._,In the present Book there is not by any means as much divine
3506,_BOOK SIXTH._,intervention as in the preceding one; we pass from the lower realm of
3507,_BOOK SIXTH._,"the water-gods to that of Pallas, the goddess of intelligence, who is"
3508,_BOOK SIXTH._,the sole active divinity in this Book. She appears to Nausicaa at the
3509,_BOOK SIXTH._,"beginning in the form of a dream, and bids the maiden look after some"
3510,_BOOK SIXTH._,"washing. Our first question is, why call in a goddess for such a"
3511,_BOOK SIXTH._,"purpose? The procedure seems trivial and unnecessary, and so it would"
3512,_BOOK SIXTH._,be under ordinary circumstances. But through this humble and
3513,_BOOK SIXTH._,common-place duty Nausicaa is made a link in the grand chain of the
3514,_BOOK SIXTH._,"Return of Ulysses, which is the divine plan underlying the whole poem,"
3515,_BOOK SIXTH._,and is specially the work of Pallas. To be sure this had no place in
3516,_BOOK SIXTH._,"Nausicaa's intention, but it does have a place in the providential"
3517,_BOOK SIXTH._,"scheme, which has, therefore, to be voiced by the Goddess. Yet that"
3518,_BOOK SIXTH._,"scheme does not conflict with the free-will of the maiden, which finds"
3519,_BOOK SIXTH._,"its fullest scope just in this household duty, and brings out her"
3520,_BOOK SIXTH._,"character. She reveals to Ulysses her nature, this is the occasion; she"
3521,_BOOK SIXTH._,had to be free to represent what she truly was to the much-experienced
3522,_BOOK SIXTH._,"man. An ordinary wash-day has little divinity in it, but this one is"
3523,_BOOK SIXTH._,"filled with the divine plan. Thus small events, otherwise immediately"
3524,_BOOK SIXTH._,"forgotten, may by a mighty co-incidence he elevated into the sphere of"
3525,_BOOK SIXTH._,"the World's History, and become ever memorable. That French soldier who"
3526,_BOOK SIXTH._,threw a camp-kettle over the head of Mirabeau's ancestor and thus saved
3527,_BOOK SIXTH._,"him from being trampled to death by a passing troop of cavalry, made"
3528,_BOOK SIXTH._,"himself a factor in the French Revolution, and was inspired by whom,"
3529,_BOOK SIXTH._,demon or angel?
3530,_BOOK SIXTH._,
3531,_BOOK SIXTH._,"As already hinted, the structure of the Book is determined by the two"
3532,_BOOK SIXTH._,"interventions of Pallas, which divide it into two portions; these are"
3533,_BOOK SIXTH._,shown in the following outline:--
3534,_BOOK SIXTH._,
3535,_BOOK SIXTH._,"I.  (1.) Pallas appears to Nausicaa in a dream, and gives the"
3536,_BOOK SIXTH._,suggestion.
3537,_BOOK SIXTH._,
3538,_BOOK SIXTH._,"(2.) Nausicaa, when she awakes, obeys the suggestion and"
3539,_BOOK SIXTH._,proceeds to the place of the washing.
3540,_BOOK SIXTH._,
3541,_BOOK SIXTH._,"II. (1.) Ulysses also asleep, lies in his cover not far from the"
3542,_BOOK SIXTH._,"same spot, when Pallas starts the plan for his waking."
3543,_BOOK SIXTH._,
3544,_BOOK SIXTH._,"(2.) Meeting of Ulysses and Nausicaa, and the going to the city."
3545,_BOOK SIXTH._,
3546,_BOOK SIXTH._,"In both parts we observe the same general method; the divine influence,"
3547,_BOOK SIXTH._,"beginning above, moves below and weaves the mortal into its scheme"
3548,_BOOK SIXTH._,through his own action.
3549,_BOOK SIXTH._,
3550,_BOOK SIXTH._,
3551,I.,I.
3552,I.,
3553,I.,First is a short introduction giving a bit of the history of the
3554,I.,"Phæacians, in which we catch a glimpse of their development. They once"
3555,I.,"dwelt near the Cyclops, the wild men of nature, from whom they moved"
3556,I.,away on account of injuries received; they could live no longer in such
3557,I.,"a neighborhood. Here we note an important separation, probably a change"
3558,I.,of life which leaves the ruder stage behind. The colony is led forth to
3559,I.,"a new land by its hero, who lays the foundation of a social order by"
3560,I.,"building houses, temples to the Gods, and a wall round the city, and"
3561,I.,who divides the territory. Thus a civil polity begins by getting away
3562,I.,"from ""the insolent Cyclops"" or savages. On the other hand, civilized"
3563,I.,"enemies who might bring war, seem not to dwell near the Phæacians,"
3564,I.,"beloved of the Gods. Beyond all conflict, inner and outer, lies the"
3565,I.,fortunate realm; it touches the happy mean between barbarism and
3566,I.,"civilization, though perchance on the road from former to latter; at"
3567,I.,"present, however, it is without the evils which go before it and come"
3568,I.,"after it. As already stated, it is an idyllic world, life appears to be"
3569,I.,"one continued festival, with song and dance of youth. It is not real"
3570,I.,"Greece, not Ithaca, which just now is a land of discord and conflict."
3571,I.,What the poet says of Olympus in a famous passage a little further on
3572,I.,"in this book, seems applicable, in spirit at least, to Phæacia:"
3573,I.,
3574,I.,"The storm-wind shakes it not, nor is it wet"
3575,I.,"By showers, and there the snow doth never fall;"
3576,I.,"The calm clear ether is without a cloud,"
3577,I.,And over all is spread a soft white sheen.
3578,I.,
3579,I.,"1. Now comes the appearance of Pallas, who ""like a breath of wind"""
3580,I.,"approaches the couch of the maiden in slumber, and admonishes her about"
3581,I.,the washing. Some such care the Goddess does impose upon the
3582,I.,"housekeeper to this day, and if report be true, at times troubles her"
3583,I.,"dreams. It is indeed an important duty, this necessity of keeping the"
3584,I.,"household and its members clean, specially the men, too often"
3585,I.,"indifferent. Young Nausicaa, just entering upon womanhood, is ready for"
3586,I.,the divine suggestion; plainly she has come to that age at which the
3587,I.,Goddess must speak to her on such matters. So much for Pallas at
3588,I.,present.
3589,I.,
3590,I.,2. Therewith we touch another fact; the maiden has reached the time
3591,I.,"when she must think, of marriage, which she instinctively regards as"
3592,I.,her true destiny in life. Still it does not appear that she is
3593,I.,"betrothed though ""the noblest Phæacians are wooing thee."" In simple"
3594,I.,"innocence there hovers in her mind the thought of Family, yet she shows"
3595,I.,a shy reserve even before her father. With that sweet thought is joined
3596,I.,"the primary household care, which naturally enough comes to her in a"
3597,I.,dream. Cleanliness is next to godliness is our modern saying; it is
3598,I.,"certainly the outward visible token of purity, which Nausicaa is going"
3599,I.,to bring into her domestic surroundings. We may reasonably think that
3600,I.,in the present scene the external deed and the internal character
3601,I.,mirror each other.
3602,I.,
3603,I.,"It must be confessed, however, that to the modern woman wash-day, ""blue"
3604,I.,"Monday,"" is usually a day bringing an unpleasant mood, if not positive"
3605,I.,terror. She will often declare that she cannot enjoy this Phæacian idyl
3606,I.,on account of its associations; she refuses to accept in image what in
3607,I.,real life is so disagreeable. As a symbol of purification the thing may
3608,I.,"pass, but no human being wishes to be purified too often. Nausicaa's"
3609,I.,"occupation is not popular with her sex, and she herself has not"
3610,I.,altogether escaped from a tinge of disrelish.
3611,I.,
3612,I.,"It is curious to note how customs endure. What Homer saw, the traveler"
3613,I.,in Greece will see to-day wherever a stream runs near a village. The
3614,I.,"Nausicaas of the place, daughters and mothers too, will be found at the"
3615,I.,"water's side, going through this same Phæacian process, themselves in"
3616,I.,"white garments even at their labor, pounding, rubbing, rinsing the"
3617,I.,"white garments of their husbands, brothers, sons. Not without sympathy"
3618,I.,"will the by-stander look on, thinking that those efforts are to make"
3619,I.,"clean themselves and their household, life being in truth a continual"
3620,I.,cleansing for every human soul. So Hellas has still the appearance of
3621,I.,"an eternal wash-day. (See author's _Walk in Hellas, passim_.)"
3622,I.,
3623,I.,Nausicaa obtains without difficulty wagon and mules and help of
3624,I.,"servants. After all, the affair is something of a frolic or outing;"
3625,I.,"when the task is done, there is the bath, the song, and a game of ball."
3626,I.,It is worthy of notice that the word (_amaxa_) here used by old Homer
3627,I.,"for _wagon_, may still be heard throughout Greece for the same or a"
3628,I.,similar thing. In the harbor of Piræus the hackman will ask the
3629,I.,"traveler: ""Do you want my _amaxa_?"" The dance (_choros_), is still the"
3630,I.,"chief amusement of the Greek villagers, and, as in Nausicaa's time, the"
3631,I.,"young man wishes to enter the dance with new-washed garments, white as"
3632,I.,"snow, whose folds ripple around his body in harmony with his graceful"
3633,I.,"movements. Many an echo of Phæacia, in language, custom and costume,"
3634,I.,"can be found in Greece at present, indicating, like the Cyclopean"
3635,I.,"masonry, the solid and permanent substructure of Homer's poetry, still"
3636,I.,in place after more than 2500 years of wear and tear.
3637,I.,
3638,I.,
3639,II.,II.
3640,II.,
3641,II.,"The washing is done now, the sport is over, and the party is getting"
3642,II.,ready to go home; but the main object is not yet accomplished. Ulysses
3643,II.,and Nausicaa are here to be brought together--the much-experienced man
3644,II.,and the innocent maiden with her pure ethical instinct of Family. In
3645,II.,"many ways the two stand far asunder, yet in one thing they are alike:"
3646,II.,"each is seeking the domestic relation, each will consummate the bond of"
3647,II.,"love which has two phases, the one being after marriage and the other"
3648,II.,before marriage. Both are moving in their deepest nature toward the
3649,II.,"unity of the Family, though on different lines; Ulysses and Nausicaa"
3650,II.,"have a common trait of character, which will be sympathetically found"
3651,II.,by each and will bring them together.
3652,II.,
3653,II.,"I. At this fresh turn of affairs there is an intervention of Pallas,"
3654,II.,"not prolonged, but sufficient: ""Thereupon Athena (Pallas) planned other"
3655,II.,"things, that Ulysses should wake, and see the fair-faced maiden who"
3656,II.,"would conduct him to the city of the Phæacians."" The Goddess does not"
3657,II.,"appear in person, as the deities so often do in the Iliad, nor does she"
3658,II.,"take a mortal shape, or move Ulysses through a dream; she simply brings"
3659,II.,"about an incident, natural enough, to wake the sleeping hero. Why then"
3660,II.,introduce the Goddess at all? Because the poet wishes to emphasize the
3661,II.,fact that this simple incident is a link in the providential chain;
3662,II.,otherwise it would have no mention. The ball is thrown at one of the
3663,II.,"servants, it falls into the stream, whereat there is an outcry--and"
3664,II.,Ulysses wakes.
3665,II.,
3666,II.,"Of course, the latter had at first his usual fit of doubt and"
3667,II.,"complaint, just when the Gods are helping him: ""Ah me! to what land"
3668,II.,"have I come! What men are here--wild, insolent, unjust, or are they"
3669,II.,"hospitable, reverencing the Gods? I shall go forth and test the"
3670,II.,"matter""--and so by an act of will he rescues himself from inner"
3671,II.,brooding and finds out the truth.
3672,II.,
3673,II.,2. Now we are to witness the gradual outer approach between Ulysses and
3674,II.,"Nausicaa, till it becomes internal, and ends in a strong feeling of"
3675,II.,"friendship if not in a warmer emotion. The wanderer, almost naked, with"
3676,II.,"only ""a branch of thick leaves bound about his loins,"" comes forth from"
3677,II.,"his hiding place, a frightful object to anybody, a wild man apparently."
3678,II.,
3679,II.,"All the servants run, but Nausicaa stands her ground before the nude"
3680,II.,"monster; being a Princess she shows her noble blood, and, being"
3681,II.,"innocent herself, what can she he afraid of? Thus does the poet"
3682,II.,"distinguish her spiritually among her attendants, as a few lines before"
3683,II.,in the famous comparison with Diana he distinguished her physically:
3684,II.,"""Over all the rest are seen her head and brow, easily is she known"
3685,II.,"among them, though all are fair: such was the spotless virgin mid her"
3686,II.,"maids."" Thus is hinted the outer and also the inner superiority which"
3687,II.,has now revealed itself in the Phæacian Princess.
3688,II.,
3689,II.,"Henceforth a subtle interplay takes place between her and Ulysses, in"
3690,II.,"which we observe three main stages: First, the wild man in appearance"
3691,II.,"he steps forth, yet he succeeds in touching her sympathy, wherein her"
3692,II.,"charity is shown; Second, the transformed man, now a God in appearance"
3693,II.,"he becomes, at whose view the maiden begins to show deep admiration, if"
3694,II.,"not love; Third, the passing of Ulysses to the city to which he is"
3695,II.,"conducted by the maiden, who also tells him how to reach the heart of"
3696,II.,"the family, namely, the mother Arete. Thus she seeks to mediate him"
3697,II.,with her country and her hearth.
3698,II.,
3699,II.,"(1) Ulysses, issuing from his lair, addresses her in a speech which"
3700,II.,shows superb skill on account of its gradual penetration to the soul of
3701,II.,the fair hearer. He praises first her external beauty with many a happy
3702,II.,"touch, yet with an excess which seems to border on adulation. This"
3703,II.,reaches her outer ear and bespeaks his good-will and gentleness at
3704,II.,"least. Then he strikes a deeper chord: he mentions his sufferings,"
3705,II.,"those which are past, and forebodes those which are yet to be,"
3706,II.,"perchance upon this shore. ""Therefore, O Princess, have compassion,"
3707,II.,since I have come to thee first; none besides thee do I know in this
3708,II.,"land. Give me some old rag to throw around me, some useless wrappage"
3709,II.,"which you may have brought hither."" Pathetic indeed is the appeal;"
3710,II.,"therewith comes sympathy, the man is no wild Cyclops, whom all"
3711,II.,"Phæacians still remembered with terror, but a victim of misfortune."
3712,II.,
3713,II.,"Now comes the culmination of his speech, which shows his keen insight"
3714,II.,"into human nature, as well as his own deepest longing: ""May the Gods"
3715,II.,"grant thy heart's desire---husband, home, and wedded harmony."" With"
3716,II.,this praise of domestic life upon his lips he has touched the
3717,II.,profoundest chord of her heart; he has divined her secretest yet
3718,II.,"strongest instinct, and has appealed to it in deep emotion. Yet mark!"
3719,II.,in the same general direction lies his own dearest hope: he also will
3720,II.,"return home, to wife and family. Thus he has found the common"
3721,II.,meeting-place of their souls; the two strike the absolutely concordant
3722,II.,"note and are one in feeling--he the husband, she the maiden."
3723,II.,
3724,II.,"In her answer she expresses her strong sympathy, her words indeed rise"
3725,II.,into the realm of charity. It is no mark of baseness to be unfortunate;
3726,II.,"""but these must endure,"" what Zeus lays upon them. Such is the"
3727,II.,exhortation of the young maiden to the much-enduring man; she has
3728,II.,"divined too the ground-work of his character. ""But now, since thou hast"
3729,II.,"come to our land, thou shalt not want for garment or anything else"
3730,II.,"proper for the needy suppliant."" Then she recalls her attendants,"
3731,II.,"reproving them for their flight, and orders them to give to Ulysses"
3732,II.,"food and drink, oil to be used after bathing, and ample raiment. Nor"
3733,II.,"should we pass by that other expression of hers: ""all strangers and the"
3734,II.,"poor are Jove's own,"" under the special protection of the Supreme God,"
3735,II.,"who will avenge their disregard. Such is this ideal world of Phæacia,"
3736,II.,still ideal to-day; for where is it realized? The old poet has cast the
3737,II.,imago of a society which we are still trying to embody. Well can she
3738,II.,"say that the Phæacians dwell far apart from the rest of the nations,"
3739,II.,"""nor does any mortal hold intercourse with us."" Thus, too, she marks"
3740,II.,unconsciously the limit of her people.
3741,II.,
3742,II.,"(2) The reader, along with Nausicaa, is to see the transformation of"
3743,II.,"the beggarly wanderer, who, having taken his bath and put on his"
3744,II.,"raiment, comes forth like a God. This is said to be the work of Pallas,"
3745,II.,"""who caused him to appear taller and more powerful, with flowing locks,"
3746,II.,"like the hyacinth."" He becomes plastic in form, beautiful as a statue,"
3747,II.,into which the divine soul has been transfused by the artist. Such a
3748,II.,"transforming power lies within him, yet is granted also by a deity; the"
3749,II.,"godlike in the man now takes on a bodily, or rather a sculpturesque"
3750,II.,"appearance, and prophesies Greek plastic art."
3751,II.,
3752,II.,"The echo of this change is heard in the words of the maiden: ""Hear me"
3753,II.,attendants; not without the will of the Olympians does this man come to
3754,II.,"us; lately I thought him unseemly, now he is like the Gods who hold the"
3755,II.,"broad Heavens."" Such is her lively admiration now, but what means this?"
3756,II.,"""Would that such a man might be called my husband, dwelling here in"
3757,II.,"Phæacia!"" That note is indeed deeper than admiration."
3758,II.,
3759,II.,(3) The third phase of this little play is the bringing of Ulysses to
3760,II.,"the city and home of Nausicaa. He, having satisfied his hunger, and"
3761,II.,"being ready to start, receives some advice from the maiden, who seeks"
3762,II.,to conduct him at once to the center of the home. They will pass first
3763,II.,"through the outlying country, which shows cultivation; then they will"
3764,II.,"go up into the city, with its lofty tower and double harbor; the"
3765,II.,"seafaring character of the people is especially set forth by Nausicaa,"
3766,II.,whose name is derived from the Greek word for a ship. Particularly we
3767,II.,"must notice her fear of gossip, which also existed in Phæacia, ideal"
3768,II.,though the land was. She must not be seen with Ulysses; men with evil
3769,II.,"tongues would say: ""What stranger is this following Nausicaa? Now she"
3770,II.,"will have a husband."" The sharp eye of Goethe detected in this passage"
3771,II.,"the true motive; it is love, always having the tendency to deny itself,"
3772,II.,which dictates so carefully this avoidance of public report; the thing
3773,II.,must not be said just because there is good reason for saying it. Her
3774,II.,solicitude betrays her feeling. In pure simplicity of heart she pays
3775,II.,"the supreme compliment to Ulysses, likening him indirectly to ""a God"
3776,II.,"called down from Heaven by her prayers, to live with her all her days."""
3777,II.,"Still further she intimates in the same passage, that ""many noble"
3778,II.,"suitors woo her, but she treats them with disdain, they are Phæacians."""
3779,II.,To be sure she puts these words into the mouth of a gossipy and
3780,II.,"somewhat disgruntled countryman, but they come round to their mark like"
3781,II.,a boomerang. Does she not thus announce to the much-enduring man that
3782,II.,"she is free, though under a good deal of pressure? All this is done in"
3783,II.,"such an artless way, that it becomes the highest art--something which"
3784,II.,she does not intend but cannot help. Surely such a speech from such a
3785,II.,source ought to repay him for suffering shipwreck and for ten years'
3786,II.,wandering.
3787,II.,
3788,II.,"We cannot, therefore, think of calling this passage spurious, with some"
3789,II.,critics both ancient and modern. The complaint against it is that the
3790,II.,"young Phæacian lady shows here too much reflection, in conjunction with"
3791,II.,a tendency to sarcasm foreign to her life. But we find it eminently
3792,II.,unreflective and naive; the very point of the passage is that she
3793,II.,unconsciously reveals the deepest hidden thought and purpose of her
3794,II.,"heart to Ulysses. With all her being she must move toward the Family,"
3795,II.,she would not be herself unless she did; yet how completely she
3796,II.,preserves modesty and simple-heartedness! Nor is the sarcastic tinge
3797,II.,foreign to young girls. So we shall have to set aside the objections of
3798,II.,"Aristarchus the old Greek, and Faesi the modern German, commentator."
3799,II.,
3800,II.,But the final instruction of Nausicaa is the most interesting; the
3801,II.,"suppliant is not to go to the father but to the mother. Nay, he is to"
3802,II.,"""pass by my father's throne and clasp my mother's knees,"" in token of"
3803,II.,supplication; then he may see the day of return. Herein we may behold
3804,II.,"in general, the honored place of the mother as the center of the"
3805,II.,"Family, its heart, as it were, full of the tender feelings of"
3806,II.,"compassion and mercy. In the father and king, on the other hand, is the"
3807,II.,"man of the State with its inflexible justice, often putting aside"
3808,II.,sympathy and commiseration with misfortune. The woman's heart may
3809,II.,"indeed be called the heart of the world, recognized here by the old"
3810,II.,poet and his Phæacians.
3811,II.,
3812,II.,"This mother, however, is in herself a great character; she is next to"
3813,II.,"have a Book of her own, which will more fully set forth her position."
3814,II.,
3815,II.,"The character of Nausicaa, as here unfolded in the ancient poet, has"
3816,II.,captivated many generations of readers since Homer began to be read.
3817,II.,The story has lived and renewed itself in manifold forms; it has that
3818,II.,"highest power of a genuine mythus, it produces itself through all ages,"
3819,II.,taking on a fresh vesture in Time. In old Hellas the tale of Nausicaa
3820,II.,was wrought over into various shapes after Homer; it was transformed
3821,II.,"into a drama, love-story, as well as idyl. The myth-making spirit did"
3822,II.,"not let it drop, but kept unfolding it; later legend, for instance,"
3823,II.,brought about a marriage between Telemachus and Nausicaa. Our recent
3824,II.,"greatest poet, Goethe, also responded mightily to the story of"
3825,II.,"Nausicaa; he planned a drama on the subject, of which the outline is to"
3826,II.,be found in his published works. He did not find time to finish his
3827,II.,"poem, but there is evidence that he thought much about it and carried"
3828,II.,"it around with him, for a long period. One regrets that the German poet"
3829,II.,was not able to give this new transformation of his ancient Greek
3830,II.,"brother, with whom he has manifested on so many lines an intimate"
3831,II.,connection and poetical kinship. In portions of the _Italian
3832,II.,Journey_ specially we see how deeply the Odyssey was moving him and
3833,II.,how he was almost on the point of reproducing the whole poem with its
3834,II.,"marine scenery. But Nausicaa in particular fascinated him, and it would"
3835,II.,have been the best commentary on the present Book to have seen her in a
3836,II.,now grand poetic epiphany in the modern drama of Goethe.

3841,_BOOK SEVENTH._,_BOOK SEVENTH._
3842,_BOOK SEVENTH._,
3843,_BOOK SEVENTH._,
3844,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"If the last Book was Nausicaa's, this one is Arete's; there is the"
3845,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"transition from the daughter to the mother, from the maiden to the"
3846,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"wife. Still it is not quite so emphatically a woman's Book, since the"
3847,_BOOK SEVENTH._,wife has to include the husband in her world. Ulysses now goes to the
3848,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"center of the Family, to its heart, that he may meet with compassion."
3849,_BOOK SEVENTH._,Still she withholds her sympathy at first for a good reason; Arete is
3850,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"not wholly impulse and feeling, she has thought, reflection. So, after"
3851,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"all, it is left to the men to take up the suppliant."
3852,_BOOK SEVENTH._,
3853,_BOOK SEVENTH._,Very surprising to us moderns is the picture drawn by the old Greek
3854,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"poet of this woman, and of her position: ""the people look upon her as a"
3855,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"God when she goes through the city;"" her mind is especially praised;"
3856,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"she has a judicial character, supposed usually to be alien to women:"
3857,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"""she decides controversies among men,"" or perchance harmonizes them. To"
3858,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"be sure her position is stated as exceptional: ""her husband honors her,"
3859,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"as no other woman on earth is honored;"" she is evidently his counselor"
3860,_BOOK SEVENTH._,as well as wife. Thus the poet would have us regard Arete not merely as
3861,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"a person of kind feelings and of sweet womanly instincts, but she has"
3862,_BOOK SEVENTH._,also the highest order of intelligence; she is united with her husband
3863,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"in head as well as in heart, perchance overtopping him in ability. Not"
3864,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"domestic simply is the picture, it rises into the political sphere,"
3865,_BOOK SEVENTH._,even into the administration of justice.
3866,_BOOK SEVENTH._,
3867,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"Is the character of the woman, as thus set forth, possibly a thousand"
3868,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"years before Christ, by a heathen poet in an uncivilized age"
3869,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"comparatively, to be a prophecy unto us still at this late date?"
3870,_BOOK SEVENTH._,Certainly the most advanced woman of to-day in the most advanced part
3871,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"of the world as regards her opportunities, has hardly reached the"
3872,_BOOK SEVENTH._,height of Arete. Unquestionably a glorious ideal is set up before the
3873,_BOOK SEVENTH._,Sisterhood of all time for emulation; or is it unattainable? At any
3874,_BOOK SEVENTH._,rate the woman in Homer stands far in advance of her later historical
3875,_BOOK SEVENTH._,position in Greece.
3876,_BOOK SEVENTH._,
3877,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"We may now turn to the husband for a moment, Alcinous the King, the man"
3878,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"of civil authority who represents the State, whose function is to be"
3879,_BOOK SEVENTH._,the protector of the Family and of whomever the family receives into
3880,_BOOK SEVENTH._,its bosom rightfully. He is the element surrounding and guarding the
3881,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"warm domestic center; still he seems to have stronger impulses, or"
3882,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"probably less governed, than his wife. Distinctly is the superiority"
3883,_BOOK SEVENTH._,accorded to the woman in this discourse of Pallas to Ulysses; possibly
3884,_BOOK SEVENTH._,the Goddess may have overdrawn the picture a little in favor of her
3885,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"sex, as really Alcinous becomes the more prominent figure later one."
3886,_BOOK SEVENTH._,
3887,_BOOK SEVENTH._,So we catch a very fascinating glimpse of the Phæacian world. Two
3888,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"prominent characters representing the two great institutions of man,"
3889,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"Family and State, we witness; thus is the spirit of the whole poem"
3890,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"ethical. Here is no longer the realm of Calypso, the nymph of wild"
3891,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"untrained nature, but the clear sunlit prospect of home and country,"
3892,_BOOK SEVENTH._,the anticipation of sunny Ithaca and prudent Penelope to the hapless
3893,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"sufferer. Ulysses sees his own land in the image of Phæacia, sees what"
3894,_BOOK SEVENTH._,he is to make out of his own island. Verily it is a great and
3895,_BOOK SEVENTH._,epoch-making experience for him just before his return; he finds the
3896,_BOOK SEVENTH._,ideal here which he is to realize.
3897,_BOOK SEVENTH._,
3898,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"Accordingly we have in line three women, Calypso, Nausicaa, Arete,"
3899,_BOOK SEVENTH._,through whose spheres Ulysses has passed on his way to his own female
3900,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"counterpart, Penelope. We may see in them phases of man's development"
3901,_BOOK SEVENTH._,out of a sensuous into an institutional life. Nor is the suggestion too
3902,_BOOK SEVENTH._,remote that we may trace in this movement certain outlines in the
3903,_BOOK SEVENTH._,progress of mankind toward civilization.
3904,_BOOK SEVENTH._,
3905,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"In the mythical history of Phæacia which is also here given, we can"
3906,_BOOK SEVENTH._,observe the same development suggested with greater distinctness.
3907,_BOOK SEVENTH._,Already in the previous Book it was stated that the Phæacians at first
3908,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"""dwelt near the insolent Cyclops,"" from whom they had to make the"
3909,_BOOK SEVENTH._,removal to their present island on account of violence done them by
3910,_BOOK SEVENTH._,their neighbors. But now we hear that both Alcinous and Arete are
3911,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"descended on one side from the daughter of King Eurymedon, ""who ruled"
3912,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"over the arrogant race of Giants,"" all of whom, both king and ""wicked"
3913,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"people,"" had perished. On the other side the royal pair had the sea-god"
3914,_BOOK SEVENTH._,Neptune as their progenitor who was also the father of the Cyclops
3915,_BOOK SEVENTH._,Polyphemus. It is impossible to mistake the meaning of this genealogy
3916,_BOOK SEVENTH._,and the reason of its introduction at the present conjuncture. The
3917,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"Phæacians likewise were sprung of the wild men of nature, and had been"
3918,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"at one time savages; but they had changed, had separated from their"
3919,_BOOK SEVENTH._,primitive kindred and begun the march of civilization. The poet has
3920,_BOOK SEVENTH._,manifestly before his mind this question: why does one branch of the
3921,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"same people develop, and another branch lag behind; why, of two"
3922,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"brothers, does one become civilized and the other remain savage? Of"
3923,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"this dualism Greece would furnish many striking illustrations, whereof"
3924,_BOOK SEVENTH._,the difference between Athena and Sparta is the best known. Here the
3925,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"change from the locality of the Cyclops, implying also the change in"
3926,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"spirit, is made by a hero-king, ""the large-souled Nausithous,"""
3927,_BOOK SEVENTH._,evidently a very important man to the Phæacians. Then this respect
3928,_BOOK SEVENTH._,given to the woman has often been noted as both the sign and the cause
3929,_BOOK SEVENTH._,of a higher development of a people. At any rate the Phæacians have
3930,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"made the great transition from savagery to civilization, and thus"
3931,_BOOK SEVENTH._,reveal the inherent possibilities of the race.
3932,_BOOK SEVENTH._,
3933,_BOOK SEVENTH._,We now begin to catch a hint of the sweep of the poem in these
3934,_BOOK SEVENTH._,portions. Ulysses who has lapsed or at least has become separated from
3935,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"his institutional life, must travel back to the same through the whole"
3936,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"rise of society; he has to see its becoming in his own experience, and"
3937,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"to a degree create it over again in his own soul, having lost it. Hence"
3938,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"the evolution of the social organism passes before his eyes, embodied"
3939,_BOOK SEVENTH._,in a series of persons and places.
3940,_BOOK SEVENTH._,
3941,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"In this Seventh Book, therefore, Ulysses is to make the transition to"
3942,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"Family and State as shown in Phæacia, and as represented by Arete and"
3943,_BOOK SEVENTH._,Alcinous. We shall mark three leading divisions:--
3944,_BOOK SEVENTH._,
3945,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"I. Ulysses enters the city in the dark, when he is met by Pallas and"
3946,_BOOK SEVENTH._,receives her instructions. The divine principle again comes down and
3947,_BOOK SEVENTH._,directs.
3948,_BOOK SEVENTH._,
3949,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"II. The external side of this Phæacian world is shown in the city,"
3950,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"garden, and palace of the king; nature is transformed and made"
3951,_BOOK SEVENTH._,beautiful for man. All this Ulysses now beholds.
3952,_BOOK SEVENTH._,
3953,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"III. The internal side of this Phæacian world, its spiritual essence,"
3954,_BOOK SEVENTH._,is shown in the domestic and civil life of the rulers and nobles; of
3955,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"this also Ulysses is the spectator, recognizing and appropriating."
3956,_BOOK SEVENTH._,
3957,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"Thus we see in the Book the movement from the divine to the human,"
3958,_BOOK SEVENTH._,which we have so often before noticed in Homer. The three parts we may
3959,_BOOK SEVENTH._,well put together into a whole: the Goddess of Intelligence informs the
3960,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"mind of man, which then transforms nature and builds institutions. Here"
3961,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"Pallas simply directs Ulysses, who, however, is now to witness the"
3962,_BOOK SEVENTH._,"works of mind done in Phæacia, to recognize them and to take them up"
3963,_BOOK SEVENTH._,into his spirit.
3964,_BOOK SEVENTH._,
3965,_BOOK SEVENTH._,
3966,I.,I.
3967,I.,
3968,I.,Ulysses follows the direction of Nausicaa and passes to the city
3969,I.,"stealthily in a kind of concealment; ""Pallas threw a divine mist over"
3970,I.,"him,"" the Goddess now having the matter in hand. Moreover she appeared"
3971,I.,"to him in the shape of a young girl with a pitcher, who points out the"
3972,I.,house of Alcinous and gives him many a precious bit of history in her
3973,I.,prattle. Again we must see what this divine intervention means; Pallas
3974,I.,is in him as well as outside of him. These are suggestions of his own
3975,I.,"ingenuity on the one hand, yet also the voice of the situation; indeed"
3976,I.,he knew them essentially already from the instructions of Nausicaa.
3977,I.,"Still further, they are now a part of the grand scheme, which is in the"
3978,I.,"Olympian order, and hence is voiced by the Gods."
3979,I.,
3980,I.,The poet introduces his mythical forms; we hear also the fabulous
3981,I.,"genealogy of the Phæacian rulers, the meaning of which has been above"
3982,I.,"set forth. They, too, Arete and Alcinous, have come from the Cyclops,"
3983,I.,"and have made the same journey as Ulysses, though in a different"
3984,I.,manner. It must be remembered that he has had his struggle with the
3985,I.,"giant Polyphemus, one of the Cyclops, whereof he will hereafter give"
3986,I.,the account. But the chief matter of the communication of Pallas is to
3987,I.,"define to Ulysses the position and character of Arete, evidently a"
3988,I.,"woman after her own heart. In this way the Goddess, taking the part of"
3989,I.,"a prattling maid, gives the royal pedigree, and especially dwells on"
3990,I.,the importance of the queen. Also she throws side glances into the
3991,I.,"peculiar disposition of the Phæacians, needful to be known to the"
3992,I.,"new-comer. They are a people by themselves, distrustful of other"
3993,I.,peoples; they too must be transcended.
3994,I.,
3995,I.,It is well at this point to observe Homer's procedure in regard to
3996,I.,Pallas. We can distinguish two different ways of employing the Goddess.
3997,I.,The poet says that Pallas gives to the Phæacian women surpassing skill
3998,I.,"in the art of weaving. This is almost allegorical, if not quite; the"
3999,I.,"Goddess stands for a quality of mind, is subjective. Again, when she"
4000,I.,"endows Ulysses with forecast in an emergency, it is only another"
4001,I.,statement for his mental prevision. Many such expressions we can find
4002,I.,"in the Odyssey; Pallas is becoming a formula, indicating simply some"
4003,I.,activity of mind in the individual. But in the important places the
4004,I.,"Goddess is kept mythical; that is, she voices the Divine Order, she"
4005,I.,"utters the grand ethical purpose of the poem, or makes herself a vital"
4006,I.,"part thereof. Thus she is objective, truly mythical; in the other case"
4007,I.,she is subjective and is getting to be an allegorical figure. The
4008,I.,"Odyssey, with its greater internality compared with the Iliad, is"
4009,I.,losing the mythus.
4010,I.,
4011,I.,There is a third way of using Pallas and the Gods which is hardly found
4012,I.,"in Homer, indeed could not be found to any extent without destroying"
4013,I.,"him. This is the external way of employing the deities, who appear"
4014,I.,"wholly on the outside and give their command to mortals, or influence"
4015,I.,"them by divine authority alone. Thus the Gods become mechanical, and"
4016,I.,are not a spiritual element of the human soul. Virgil leaves such an
4017,I.,"impression, and the Roman poets generally. Even the Greek tragic poets"
4018,I.,"are not free from it; especially Euripides is chargeable with this sin,"
4019,I.,which is called in dramatic language _Deus ex machina_.
4020,I.,
4021,I.,"Though the Homeric poems as wholes are not allegories, yet they have"
4022,I.,allegory playing into them. Indeed the mythus has an inherent tendency
4023,I.,"to pitch over into allegory through culture. Then there is a reaction,"
4024,I.,"the mythical spirit must assert itself even among civilized peoples,"
4025,I.,"since allegorized Gods are felt to be hollow abstractions, having"
4026,I.,nothing divine about them.
4027,I.,
4028,I.,There can hardly be a doubt that a proper conception of the relation of
4029,I.,the deities to men is the most important matter for the student of
4030,I.,Homer. But it requires an incessant alertness of mind to see the
4031,I.,"Homeric Gods when they appear to the mortal, and to observe that they"
4032,I.,"are not always the same, that they too are in the process of evolution."
4033,I.,"For instance, in the present Book as well as elsewhere, Pallas must be"
4034,I.,"noted as having two characters, a mythical and allegorical, as above"
4035,I.,"unfolded. Nitzsch, whose commentary on the Odyssey, though getting a"
4036,I.,"little antiquated, is still the best probably, because it grapples with"
4037,I.,"so many real problems of the poem, says: ""It is wholly in Homer's"
4038,I.,"manner to represent, in the form of a conversation with Pallas, what"
4039,I.,"the wise man turns over in his own mind and resolves all to himself"""
4040,I.,"(_Anmerkungen zu Homer's Odyssee, Band II, S. 137_). Very true, yet on"
4041,I.,"the next page Nitzsch says that it is ""entirely wrong to suppose that"
4042,I.,"Pallas represents the wisdom of Ulysses _allegorically_."" But what else"
4043,I.,is allegory but this embodiment of subjective wisdom? Now Nitzsch truly
4044,I.,"feels that Pallas is something altogether more than an allegory, but he"
4045,I.,"has failed to grasp distinctly her mythical character, the objective"
4046,I.,"side of the Goddess, and so gets confused and self-contradictory."
4047,I.,
4048,I.,One of the best books ever written on Homer is Nägelsbach's _Homerische
4049,I.,"Theologie_, which also wrestles with the most vital questions of the"
4050,I.,poem. But Nägelsbach's stress is almost wholly on the side of the
4051,I.,"Gods, he seems to have the smallest vision for beholding the free,"
4052,I.,"self-acting man in Homer. In his first chapter (_die Gottheit, the"
4053,I.,Godhead_) he recognizes the Gods as the upholders and directors of the
4054,I.,"Supreme Order (sec. 28); also they determine, or rather create"
4055,I.,"(_schaffen_) man's thought and will (sec. 42). What, then, is left for"
4056,I.,"the poor mortal? Of course, such a view is at variance with Homer in"
4057,I.,hundreds of passages (see especially the speech of Zeus with which the
4058,I.,"action of the Odyssey starts, and in which the highest God asserts the"
4059,I.,free-will and hence the responsibility of the man). Nägelsbach himself
4060,I.,suspects at times that something is wrong with his view and hedges here
4061,I.,and there by means of some limiting clauses; note in particular what he
4062,I.,"says about Ulysses (sec. 31), who is an exception, being ""thrown upon"
4063,I.,"his own resources in cases of extreme need,"" without the customary"
4064,I.,"intervention of the Gods. But the man in his freedom, who co-operates"
4065,I.,"with the God in the providential order, is often brought before the"
4066,I.,reader in the Iliad as well as in the Odyssey (see author's _Com. on
4067,I.,"the Iliad_, pp. 129, 157, 216, etc.)."
4068,I.,
4069,I.,
4070,II.,II.
4071,II.,
4072,II.,"We now come to one of the most famous passages in Homer, describing the"
4073,II.,"palace and garden of Alcinous. First of all, we must deem it the outer"
4074,II.,"setting of this Phæacian world with its spirit and institutions, the"
4075,II.,framework of nature transformed which takes its character from within.
4076,II.,Civilized life assumes an external appearance corresponding to itself;
4077,II.,"it remodels the physical world after its own pattern. The result is,"
4078,II.,"this garden is in striking contrast with the bower of Calypso, which is"
4079,II.,almost a wild product of nature. The two localities are mirrored
4080,II.,surrounding each home respectively. Again we observe how Homer employs
4081,II.,the description of scenery: he makes it reflect the soul as its center.
4082,II.,
4083,II.,"In a certain sense we may connect these Phæacian works with Pallas, who"
4084,II.,has directed Ulysses hither; they are the works of intelligence. The
4085,II.,arts and the industries spring up through the transformation of nature.
4086,II.,Here is first noted the palace of the king with certain hints of its
4087,II.,materials and construction; especially have the metals been wrought and
4088,II.,"applied to human uses. Gold, silver, steel, brass or bronze are"
4089,II.,mentioned in connection with the palace and its marvelous contents.
4090,II.,Thus an ideal sense of architecture we note; still more strongly
4091,II.,"indicated is the feeling for sculpture, the supreme Greek art. Those"
4092,II.,"gold and silver watch-dogs at the entrance, ""which Vulcan made by his"
4093,II.,"skill, deathless and ageless for all time;"" those golden boys ""upon"
4094,II.,"their well-built pedestals holding lighted torches in their hands"" are"
4095,II.,verily indications that the plastic artist has already appeared. The
4096,II.,naive expression of life which the old poet gives to the sculpturesque
4097,II.,"shapes in the palace of Alcinous, is fresh as the first look upon a new"
4098,II.,"world, which is indeed now rising."
4099,II.,
4100,II.,"But not only the Fine Arts, the Industries also are touched upon."
4101,II.,"Weaving is specially emphasized along with navigation, one being the"
4102,II.,Phæacian woman's and the other being the Phæacian man's most skillful
4103,II.,work. Other occupations are involved in these two. Thus is marked the
4104,II.,beginning of an industrial society.
4105,II.,
4106,II.,After the palace the garden is described with its cultivated
4107,II.,"fruit-trees--pear, pomegranate, apples--a good orchard for to-day. Of"
4108,II.,"course the vineyard could not be left out, being so important to the"
4109,II.,"Greek; three forms of its products are mentioned--the grape, the"
4110,II.,"raisin, and wine. Finally the last part is set off for kitchen"
4111,II.,"vegetables, though some translators think that it was for flowers. Nor"
4112,II.,"must we omit the two fountains, such as often spout up and run through"
4113,II.,the Greek village of the present time.
4114,II.,
4115,II.,Undoubtedly fabulous threads are spun through this description. Quite
4116,II.,too lavish a use is made of the precious metals in the house of
4117,II.,"Alcinous, as in some fairy tale or romantic ballad; so much gold is"
4118,II.,found nowhere outside of wonderland. In the garden fruit is never
4119,II.,"wanting, some of it just ripe, some still green, some in flower. No"
4120,II.,"change of season, yet the effect of all seasons; surely a marvelous"
4121,II.,country it appears; still we learn that in Campania are some sorts of
4122,II.,grapes which produce thrice a year. A mythical garden is indeed the
4123,II.,delight of human fancy. Eden has its counterparts everywhere. Indeed a
4124,II.,significant parallel might be drawn between Greek Phæacia and the
4125,II.,"Hebrew Paradise; in the one, man unfolds out of savagery, in the other"
4126,II.,he is created at once by a divine act. Can we not see Orient and
4127,II.,Occident imaging themselves in their respective ideal products? The one
4128,II.,"from below upwards, the other from above downwards; both movements, the"
4129,II.,"Greek and the Hebrew, belong to man, and have entered into his"
4130,II.,"civilization. The next world-poet, Dante, will unite the two streams."
4131,II.,
4132,II.,
4133,III.,III.
4134,III.,
4135,III.,"Ulysses now comes to the internal element of Phæacia, to its soul as it"
4136,III.,"were, manifested in the institutional life of Family and State. From"
4137,III.,this indeed is derived the beautiful world which we have just
4138,III.,"witnessed; Art builds up a dwelling-place, which images the spirit of"
4139,III.,the people to themselves and to others.
4140,III.,
4141,III.,"In accord with his instructions from both. Pallas and Nausicaa, he"
4142,III.,"first goes to Arete and clasps her knees in supplication, begging for"
4143,III.,"an escort to his country. But behold! She hesitates, notwithstanding"
4144,III.,his strong appeal to her domestic feeling and her sympathy with
4145,III.,"suffering. What can be the matter? Another Phæacian, not of the royal"
4146,III.,"house apparently, but of the nobles, is the first to speak and command"
4147,III.,the stranger to be raised up and to be hospitably received. An old
4148,III.,religious man who sees the neglect of Zeus in the neglect of the
4149,III.,"suppliant, a man of long experience, ""knowing things many and ancient,"""
4150,III.,"is this Echeneus; him at once the king obeys, the queen still remaining"
4151,III.,silent.
4152,III.,
4153,III.,"Soon, however, we catch the reason of her conduct in the question:"
4154,III.,"""Stranger, where did you get those garments?"" She noticed Ulysses"
4155,III.,"wearing the mantle and tunic ""which she herself had made with her"
4156,III.,"servants,"" and which Nausicaa had given him. Surely this is a matter"
4157,III.,which must be accounted for before proceeding further. Herein the woman
4158,III.,comes out in her own peculiar province; no man would ever have noticed
4159,III.,"the dress so closely; Alcinous did not, and wise Ulysses in this case"
4160,III.,did not forecast so far out of his masculine domain. But the poet had
4161,III.,made the subtle observation and uses it as a turning-point in his
4162,III.,little drama. Now we see the queen before us: imagine a pair of dark
4163,III.,eyes shooting indignation upon the man clothed with garments intrusted
4164,III.,this very morning to the daughter.
4165,III.,
4166,III.,"Nor should we fail to scan her second question: ""Do you not say that"
4167,III.,"you have come hither a wanderer over the deep?"" Verily the case is"
4168,III.,"suspicious. Ulysses sees his plight, and at once offers the most"
4169,III.,"elaborate explanation, going back and giving a history of himself for"
4170,III.,the last seven or eight years. Now we know why the poet specially
4171,III.,"praised the mind of Arete, and why her husband so honored her, and why"
4172,III.,she could be judge of disputes among men. She shows the keenest
4173,III.,observation united with reasoning power; she stands out in contrast
4174,III.,"with the Phæacian men, who follow impulse more readily than she, as she"
4175,III.,"keeps the judicial balance, though a woman, and demands evidence of"
4176,III.,truth from the uncertain stranger.
4177,III.,
4178,III.,"We may draw from this scene certain traits of the Phæacians, as we see"
4179,III.,"here a man, a typical man probably who is outside of the royal family."
4180,III.,An ideal humanity seems to live in them; they will receive the
4181,III.,unfortunate wanderer and succor him to the fullest extent. More
4182,III.,impressive still is their religious faith; they live in intimate
4183,III.,"communion with the Gods, who appear in person at the feast ""sitting"
4184,III.,"among us;"" nor do the deities conceal themselves from the solitary"
4185,III.,"wayfarer; ""since we are as near to them as are the Cyclops and the wild"
4186,III.,"tribes of Giants."" So speaks Alcinous, hinting that kinship, which has"
4187,III.,been previously set forth; both himself and Arete are the descendants
4188,III.,"of savages, who were children of the Gods of nature. But they have"
4189,III.,risen into fellowship with the higher Gods of Olympus. The words of the
4190,III.,"king seemed to be tinged with sarcasm at those inferior deities,"
4191,III.,"parents of savagery, from whom, however, they themselves are sprung. He"
4192,III.,"cannot forget the Cyclops, the men of violence who once did his people"
4193,III.,wrong.
4194,III.,
4195,III.,"In these mythical allusions, obscure enough just here, we have already"
4196,III.,traced the rise of Phæacia into an ethical existence. The worship of
4197,III.,"the higher Gods is the emotional side of such a condition, and the"
4198,III.,treatment of the suppliant marks an advance toward the conception of an
4199,III.,"universal humanity. Still Phæacia, has its spiritual limits, genuine"
4200,III.,"Greek limits, of which hereafter something will be said."
4201,III.,
4202,III.,"It is sufficient to state that the speech of Ulysses has its effect, it"
4203,III.,contains a great deal which appeals to the character of Arete; his
4204,III.,leaving Calypso and his desire to return to his home-life must be
4205,III.,powerful motives towards winning her sympathy. Then she cannot help
4206,III.,recognizing and admiring his skill; there is an intellectual bond
4207,III.,"between them, as well as an ethical one. Not much does she say"
4208,III.,"hereafter, her part being finished; her husband takes the lead"
4209,III.,"henceforth. She has tested the wanderer, Alcinous can now preform the"
4210,III.,ceremonies.
4211,III.,
4212,III.,"We soon see that the king needs a counterpart in such a wife, he being"
4213,III.,impulsively generous; he blames his daughter for her backwardness in
4214,III.,"not coming to town with Ulysses, whereat the latter frames one of his"
4215,III.,"smallest fibs in excuse of the maiden. Still further, the king in a"
4216,III.,"surprising burst of admiration, wishes that Ulysses, or ""such an one as"
4217,III.,"thou art,"" might stay and be called his son-in-law. Altogether too"
4218,III.,"sudden; Arete would not have said that, though the woman be the natural"
4219,III.,"match-maker. Still Alcinous, in a counter-outpouring of his generosity,"
4220,III.,"promises to send Ulysses to his own land, though ""this should be"
4221,III.,"further off than Euboea, the most distant country."" Thus overflows"
4222,III.,"the noble heart of the king, but he clearly needs his other half, in"
4223,III.,the thorny journey of life.
4224,III.,
4225,III.,Thus has Ulysses reached the heart of Phæacia and found its secret
4226,III.,"beat; he has felt its saving power, not simply externally but also"
4227,III.,internally; it rescues him from dangers of the sea and of himself too.
4228,III.,"The truly positive side of life begins to dawn upon him again, after"
4229,III.,his long career of struggle with dark fabulous shapes. Well may he pray
4230,III.,"Zeus for Alcinous: ""May his fame be immortal over the fertile earth""--a"
4231,III.,"prayer which has been fulfilled, and is still in the process of"
4232,III.,fulfillment. Arete gives the order to the servants to spread his couch
4233,III.,"for the night's repose, she has received him."
4234,III.,
4235,III.,"In the sweep of the present Book, many origins are suggested. The"
4236,III.,"genealogy of the king and queen and people is significant, it might be"
4237,III.,called the genealogy of civilization. The woman is placed at the
4238,III.,"center; out of her springs the family, and with it come society, state,"
4239,III.,the institutional world.
4240,III.,
4241,III.,"Of such a world the external environment is seen in the garden, palace,"
4242,III.,"and city of the Phæacians, which are built by the spirit for its"
4243,III.,dwelling-place and reflect the spirit. The Greek world of Beauty is
4244,III.,"born, and its course is foreshadowed; this ideal Homeric realm is"
4245,III.,prophetic of what Greece is to become. The plastic arts and the
4246,III.,"industrial arts are suggested, and to a degree are realized."
4247,III.,
4248,III.,The artistic soul of Hellas is fully felt in Homer's Phæacia. The
4249,III.,formative impulse is everywhere alive and at work; the instinctive need
4250,III.,of shaping and transforming nature and life is here in its first
4251,III.,"budding, and will bloom into the greatest art-people of all time. Those"
4252,III.,"two supreme Fine Arts of mature Greece, Architecture and Sculpture, are"
4253,III.,present in examples which foretell plainly Phidias and the Parthenon.
4254,III.,
4255,III.,"King Alcinous; thy fair palace has had fairer offspring,"
4256,III.,Thou art ruling the world still by the beautiful form;
4257,III.,"Out of thy mansion majestic was born in a song the Greek Temple,"
4258,III.,"Sentineled round with a choir--Titans columnar of stone,"
4259,III.,"Bearing forever their burden to hymns of a Parian measure,"
4260,III.,Wearing out heaviest Fate to a Pindaric high strain.
4261,III.,"Look! those boys of thy garden with tapers are moving to statues,"
4262,III.,Seeming to walk into stone while they are bringing the light;
4263,III.,Hellas springs out of thy palace all sculptured with actions
4264,III.,"heroic,"
4265,III.,Even the God we discern turning to marble by faith.
4266,III.,
4267,III.,"Such is the originative, prophetic character of Phæacia, which the"
4268,III.,"reader must take profoundly into his soul, if he would understand the"
4269,III.,genetic history of Greek spirit. Verily the poet is the maker of
4270,III.,archetypes and reveals in his shapes all that his people are to become.
4271,III.,
4272,III.,"Thou, old Homer, wert the first builder in Greece, the first"
4273,III.,"carver,"
4274,III.,Afterward she could but turn fancies of thine into stone;
4275,III.,"Architects followed thee, building thy poem aloft into temples,"
4276,III.,"Sculptors followed thee too, thinking in marble thy line."
4277,III.,
4278,III.,"Nor must we forget the Industrial Arts here suggested--weaving,"
4279,III.,"ship-building, the working of metals; in general, there is hinted the"
4280,III.,"varied transformation of nature, which begets a civilized life."
4281,III.,"Agriculture is present, also horticulture, which the garden of Alcinous"
4282,III.,"presupposes. Such, then, is the grand frame-work for the social order"
4283,III.,as here portrayed.
4284,III.,
4285,III.,"But the chief art of the Homeric world has not yet been given, though"
4286,III.,"it is at work now, and is just that which has reproduced Phæacia with"
4287,III.,"all its beauty. This is the poet's own art, which having set forth the"
4288,III.,"other arts, is next to set forth itself. Accordingly we are to see the"
4289,III.,"poet showing the poet in the following Book, which may, therefore, be"
4290,III.,named the Book of the Bard. Thus we pass out of the industrial and
4291,III.,"plastic arts of Phæacia, into the supreme art, the poetic, as it"
4292,III.,manifests itself in the Phæacian singer.

4297,_BOOK EIGHTH._,_BOOK EIGHTH._
4298,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4299,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4300,_BOOK EIGHTH._,We observe a decided change in the present Book; it has a character of
4301,_BOOK EIGHTH._,its own quite distinct from the preceding Books. Yet it is on a line of
4302,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"development with them, we note a further spiritual evolution which must"
4303,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"be looked into with some attention. In general, Phæacia is now seen as"
4304,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"an art-world, in true correspondence with Hellas, of which it is a kind"
4305,_BOOK EIGHTH._,of ideal prototype. In the two previous Books we saw portrayed chiefly
4306,_BOOK EIGHTH._,institutional life in Family and in State. But in this Book
4307,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"institutional life, though present and active, is withdrawn into the"
4308,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"background, and becomes the setting for the picture, yet also is the"
4309,_BOOK EIGHTH._,spirit which secretly calls forth the picture. A poetic art-world now
4310,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"passes before us in entrancing outlines, a world filled with song,"
4311,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"dance, games, with all the poetry of existence."
4312,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4313,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"Such an artistic development follows from what has gone before. Man,"
4314,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"having attained culture, civilization, and a certain freedom from the"
4315,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"necessity of working for his daily bread, begins to turn back and look"
4316,_BOOK EIGHTH._,at his career; he observes the past and measures how far he has come.
4317,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"The image of himself in his unfolding he beholds in art, specially in"
4318,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"the poetic art, whose essence must at last be just this institutional"
4319,_BOOK EIGHTH._,life which has been described in Phæacia. He attains it and then steps
4320,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"back and portrays his attaining of it; having done the heroic deed, he"
4321,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"must see himself doing it forever, in the strains of the bard. Art is"
4322,_BOOK EIGHTH._,thus the mirror of life and of institutions; it reflects the grand
4323,_BOOK EIGHTH._,conflict of the times and the people; it seizes upon the supreme
4324,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"national event, and holds it up in living portraiture along with its"
4325,_BOOK EIGHTH._,heroes.
4326,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4327,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"Now the great event which lies back of Phæacia at the present time, in"
4328,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"fact lies back of all Greece for all ages, perchance lies back of all"
4329,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"Europe, is the Trojan War. It was the first emphatic, triumphant"
4330,_BOOK EIGHTH._,assertion of the Greek and indeed of the European world against the
4331,_BOOK EIGHTH._,Orient. The fight before Troy was not a mere local and temporary
4332,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"conflict between two quarrelsome borderers, but it cuts to the very"
4333,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"marrow of the World's History, the grand struggle between East and"
4334,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"West. Family and State are most deeply concerned in it, the restoration"
4335,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"of the wife is the main object of the Trojan War, which the chieftains"
4336,_BOOK EIGHTH._,of Greece must conclude victoriously or perish. A new world was being
4337,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"born on this side of the Ægean, and the Greeks were its first shapers"
4338,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"and its earliest defenders. This occidental world, whose birth is the"
4339,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"real thing announced at Troy in that marvelous cradle-song of Europe,"
4340,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"called the Iliad, has already begun its career, and shows its earliest"
4341,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"period in Phæacia. It is no wonder, then, that the Phæacian people wish"
4342,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"to hear the Trojan song, and it alone, and that the Phæacian poet"
4343,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"wishes to sing the Trojan song, and it alone."
4344,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4345,_BOOK EIGHTH._,Thus we behold in the present Book a quiet idyllic folk on their island
4346,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"home out in the West listening to the mighty struggle of their race,"
4347,_BOOK EIGHTH._,with dim far-off anticipations of all that it involved. Nor were the
4348,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"women indifferent. Arete, the wife and center of the Family, is not"
4349,_BOOK EIGHTH._,henceforth to be exposed to the fate of Helen; think what would Phæacia
4350,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"be without her, or she without Phæacia; think what she would be in"
4351,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"Troy, for instance. Strong emotions must rise in the breasts of all the"
4352,_BOOK EIGHTH._,people at hearing such a song.
4353,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4354,_BOOK EIGHTH._,But still stronger emotions well out of the heart of Ulysses. He is one
4355,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"of the heroes of the Trojan War not yet returned, a living image of its"
4356,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"sacrifices. Of course, he is the main hero sung of by the bard in the"
4357,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"present Book; such is the artistic adaptation of the Homeric work,"
4358,_BOOK EIGHTH._,clearly done with a conscious design. Ulysses has already passed
4359,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"through several stages--Calypso, Nausicaa, Arete; now he has reached"
4360,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"the poet, Demodocus certainly, and perchance Homer himself, who is to"
4361,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"sing not only of the Trojan War, but also of its consequences--this"
4362,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"rise of man's spiritual hierarchy as here unfolded, from Nature, into"
4363,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"Institutions, and thence into Art. After hearing Demodocus, Ulysses"
4364,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"picks up the thread and becomes his own poet, narrating his adventures"
4365,_BOOK EIGHTH._,in Fairyland with the free full swing of the Homeric hexameter. Thus he
4366,_BOOK EIGHTH._,acquires and applies in his own way the art of Phæacia; the arch of his
4367,_BOOK EIGHTH._,life spans over from the heroic fighter before Troy to the romantic
4368,_BOOK EIGHTH._,singer before the Phæacian court.
4369,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4370,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"It is plain, therefore, that this Book is distinctively the Book of the"
4371,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"Bard. In the experience of Ulysses, Demodocus is placed on a line with"
4372,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"the three leading figures in the last three Books--they being women,"
4373,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"while the singer must be a man. One reason is, possibly, that a"
4374,_BOOK EIGHTH._,Phæacian woman could not be permitted to sing such a strain as the
4375,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"story of Venus and Mars. At any rate, he is fourth in the row of"
4376,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"shapes, all of which are significant. We catch many touches of his"
4377,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"personality; he is blind, though gifted with song; ""evil and good"" he"
4378,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"has received, and is therein a typical man. It is in every way a"
4379,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"beautiful loving picture, painted with strong deep undertones of"
4380,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"sympathy; no wonder is it, therefore, that Demodocus in all ages has"
4381,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"been taken as a portrait of Homer by himself, showing glimpses of the"
4382,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"man, of his station in life, and of his vocation. Later on we shall"
4383,_BOOK EIGHTH._,consider this point in more detail.
4384,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4385,_BOOK EIGHTH._,The three songs of the bard furnish the main landmarks for the organism
4386,_BOOK EIGHTH._,of the Book. All of them will be found more or less intimately
4387,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"connected with the great event of the immediate Past, the story of"
4388,_BOOK EIGHTH._,Troy. Phæacia shows an intense interest in that story and the bard
4389,_BOOK EIGHTH._,approves himself its worthy singer. Indeed the three songs stand in
4390,_BOOK EIGHTH._,direct relation to the Iliad; the first deals with an event antecedent
4391,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"to the Iliad; the second has the theme of the Iliad, though in a"
4392,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"changed form, inasmuch as the seducer, the wife and the husband are"
4393,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"here Gods (Mars, Venus, Vulcan) instead of mortals (Paris, Helen,"
4394,_BOOK EIGHTH._,Menelaus); the third deals with an event subsequent to the Iliad. Yet
4395,_BOOK EIGHTH._,the singer carefully avoids repeating anything in the Iliad. It is
4396,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"almost impossible not to think that he had not that poem in mind; or,"
4397,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"rather, we are forced to conclude that the present author of the"
4398,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"Odyssey knew the Iliad, and we naturally think that both were by the"
4399,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"same man. Demodocus is the singer of the Trojan War, yet he shuns"
4400,_BOOK EIGHTH._,singing what has already been sung about it. Herein we may catch
4401,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"another faint reflection of Homer, the organizer, the transfigurer of"
4402,_BOOK EIGHTH._,old legends into his two poems. Note also that he hovers around the
4403,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"Iliad, before and after it, yet never into it, here and elsewhere in"
4404,_BOOK EIGHTH._,the Odyssey; specially in the Third Book have we observed the same
4405,_BOOK EIGHTH._,fact.
4406,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4407,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"In the present Book, however, is another strand; besides these songs of"
4408,_BOOK EIGHTH._,the bard belonging to the past are the doings in Phæacia belonging to
4409,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"the present, which doings have a connection and a correspondence with"
4410,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"the songs. Thus we observe three divisions in the Book, and two threads"
4411,_BOOK EIGHTH._,which run through these divisions. The following outline may serve to
4412,_BOOK EIGHTH._,show the general structure:--
4413,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4414,_BOOK EIGHTH._,I. There is the representation of the struggle between the physical and
4415,_BOOK EIGHTH._,mental in what may be called Phæacian art; skill and strength have an
4416,_BOOK EIGHTH._,encounter shown in two ways:
4417,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4418,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"1. Past, heroic, ideal; the contest between Ulysses and Achilles at"
4419,_BOOK EIGHTH._,Troy; intelligence vs. mere courage. Sung by the bard. Pre-Iliad.
4420,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4421,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"2. Present, real, not heroic; the games in which there is a contest"
4422,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"also, and in which both skill and strength are involved, with the"
4423,_BOOK EIGHTH._,preponderance of the physical.
4424,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4425,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"II. Now we drop to the sensuous inactive side of the Phæacian world,"
4426,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"the luxurious, self-indulgent phase of their life, which is also imaged"
4427,_BOOK EIGHTH._,in their art doubly:
4428,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4429,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"1. Past; an Olympian episode, a story of illicit love among the"
4430,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"Gods, corresponding to the story of Helen on earth. Sung by the"
4431,_BOOK EIGHTH._,bard.
4432,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4433,_BOOK EIGHTH._,2. Present; hints concerning the sensuous life of the Phæacians who
4434,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"love the feast, the song, the warm bath and bed, along with dance"
4435,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"and music, showing their pleasure in art. Return of the men from"
4436,_BOOK EIGHTH._,the market-place to the palace and into the presence of Arete.
4437,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4438,_BOOK EIGHTH._,III. We pass to what may be called the triumph of intelligence and the
4439,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"recognition thereof,--Phæacian art is again introduced, Ulysses is"
4440,_BOOK EIGHTH._,revealed.
4441,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4442,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"1. Past, heroic, ideal; Troy is taken by skill, by the Wooden"
4443,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"Horse, not by the physical might and courage of Achilles. Sung by"
4444,_BOOK EIGHTH._,the bard. Post-Iliad. This may be considered also a triumph over
4445,_BOOK EIGHTH._,Venus who favored Troy.
4446,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4447,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"2. Present; Ulysses weeps, his tears are noticed by Alcinous, who"
4448,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"demands his name, country, travels. Ulysses has already in a number"
4449,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"of ways discovered himself as connected with the past, with the"
4450,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"Trojan War. In the next Book he tells his name, country, character,"
4451,_BOOK EIGHTH._,adventures.
4452,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4453,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"If we scan the sweep of this outline, we observe that it opens with the"
4454,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"conflict between Brain and Brawn, or between Mind and Might, and ends"
4455,_BOOK EIGHTH._,in the victory of Mind in the grand Trojan conflict. Similar has been
4456,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"the movement hitherto, from Calypso onwards, which, however, shows the"
4457,_BOOK EIGHTH._,ethical conflict. Still the intellectual and the ethical spheres have
4458,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"to subordinate the natural, and mind is the common principle of both."
4459,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4460,_BOOK EIGHTH._,As an introduction to the Book we have an account of the men assembling
4461,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"in the marketplace, where ""they sat on polished stones near one"
4462,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"another."" Pallas has, of course, to be employed, though in a passing"
4463,_BOOK EIGHTH._,and very subordinate way; she acts as herald to call the assembly
4464,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"together, and thus stamps it with a divine import. We must grant to the"
4465,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"poet his right, but the Goddess seems almost unnecessary here, as the"
4466,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"herald could have done the same work. Once more Pallas interferes: ""she"
4467,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"sheds a godlike grace upon the head and shoulders of Ulysses,"""
4468,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"imparting to him majesty and beauty, ""that he might be dear to all the"
4469,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"Phæacians,"" those lovers of the beautiful in art and life. Thus, like a"
4470,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"visible deity, he was ""to be feared and to be revered;"" strength also"
4471,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"the Goddess gave him, ""that he might accomplish all the contests which"
4472,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"the Phæacians would try him with."" Thus is the Hero prepared divinely."
4473,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4474,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"Alcinous makes a speech to the assembly, touching the wanderer, who is"
4475,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"again promised an escort to Ithaca; the king chooses the crew, and the"
4476,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"ship is launched. Meanwhile, however, there is to be a sacrifice with"
4477,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"festival, the bard is led in and his harp adjusted, his portion of food"
4478,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"and drink not being omitted, for he is not a hired musician, but an"
4479,_BOOK EIGHTH._,equal at the feast.
4480,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4481,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"We are now to witness two kinds of entertainment, both of which"
4482,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"according to the Greek conception, belong to the sphere of art. The one"
4483,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"is an heroic song, and is thrown into the past; the other is a trial of"
4484,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"bodily skill and strength, and belongs to the present. Both kinds show"
4485,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"contest, and this contest is mainly between the physical and the"
4486,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"spiritual elements in man. Which is paramount? Each is necessary, yet"
4487,_BOOK EIGHTH._,one must be subordinate.
4488,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4489,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"1. Note, first of all, the theme of the bard: ""The Muse inspired him to"
4490,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"sing the strife between Ulysses and Achilles, the fame whereof had"
4491,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"reached high Heaven."" The Trojan War lies manifestly in the background"
4492,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"of the quarrel. When did it take place, at what period during the"
4493,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"struggle? There is nothing to settle the question decisively, such a"
4494,_BOOK EIGHTH._,dispute might have arisen almost at any time. But as it is the
4495,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"antecedent trouble in the Greek army, a dualism which this army brings"
4496,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"with itself in its leaders, we may reasonably put it somewhere towards"
4497,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"the beginning. This is also the opinion of Nitzsch (_Com. ad loc._),"
4498,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"who places the scene of the dispute on the island of Tenedos, in sight"
4499,_BOOK EIGHTH._,of the walls of Troy and who cites the old _Cypria_ in support of his
4500,_BOOK EIGHTH._,opinion. Other ancient authorities place it after the death of Hector;
4501,_BOOK EIGHTH._,not long before the fall of the city.
4502,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4503,_BOOK EIGHTH._,Concerning the subject of the dispute there is little difference of
4504,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"opinion. The Greek commentator, Eustathius (died about 1200 A.D.)"
4505,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"cites the following legend in reference to it: ""Agamemnon, having"
4506,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"consulted the Delphic Oracle about the result of the Trojan War,"
4507,_BOOK EIGHTH._,received the answer that Troy would be taken when the best men of the
4508,_BOOK EIGHTH._,Greeks would begin to quarrel. At a feast a dispute arose between
4509,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"Achilles and Ulysses, the former maintaining that Ilion would be"
4510,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"captured by bravery, the latter by skill and cunning."" Hence the joy of"
4511,_BOOK EIGHTH._,Agamemnon at what would otherwise be regarded as a ground for sorrow.
4512,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4513,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"The response of the Oracle was ambiguous, yet even out of its ambiguity"
4514,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"we may read something. Achilles, the man of courage, was regarded as"
4515,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"the hero of the Greeks, but this opinion must be contested, and wisdom"
4516,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"must also have its place in the management of the war, before the"
4517,_BOOK EIGHTH._,hostile city can be taken. These two principles are represented by
4518,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"Achilles and Ulysses respectively. The God of Wisdom, Apollo, responds,"
4519,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"therefore, in accord with his character, carefully, doubtfully, not"
4520,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"taking a decisive stand on either side, uttering an oracle which itself"
4521,_BOOK EIGHTH._,needs interpretation. Still we can see that it means a protest against
4522,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"mere brute courage--a protest which Ulysses voices. The Trojan Horse,"
4523,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"the grand successful stratagem, may be considered as the outcome."
4524,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4525,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"In Shakespeare's _Troilus and Cressida_, the same subject is worked"
4526,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"over very fully and is indeed the main pivot of the drama, in which"
4527,_BOOK EIGHTH._,Achilles is substantially deposed from his heroship and replaced by
4528,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"Ulysses. The contest between mind and might or skill and courage, is"
4529,_BOOK EIGHTH._,what the English poet took from his Greek elder brother in part and in
4530,_BOOK EIGHTH._,part derived from later legend. The struggle between brain and brawn
4531,_BOOK EIGHTH._,was indeed a vital one in the Greek camp; there was always the danger
4532,_BOOK EIGHTH._,lest the spirit would got lost in its physical manifestation. Indeed
4533,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"the danger of the Greek world was just this, and it perished at last of"
4534,_BOOK EIGHTH._,the same disease which we already notice at Troy. It fell to a worship
4535,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"of the sensuous in life and art, and so lost its soul in a grand"
4536,_BOOK EIGHTH._,debauch.
4537,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4538,_BOOK EIGHTH._,2. King Alcinous has noticed that Ulysses hid his face and wept at the
4539,_BOOK EIGHTH._,song of the bard. Thus strong emotion seizes him on hearing the strife
4540,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"at Troy, while the Phæacians listen with delight. Such is the contrast,"
4541,_BOOK EIGHTH._,hinting two very different relations to the song. But the king will
4542,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"divert him from his grief, and so calls for the games to show him ""how"
4543,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"much we excel others in boxing, wrestling, leaping and running."" The"
4544,_BOOK EIGHTH._,quoit was also one of the games.
4545,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4546,_BOOK EIGHTH._,In like manner Achilles is diverted from his sorrows for his friend
4547,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"Patroclus, by an elaborate exhibition of games, which are set forth in"
4548,_BOOK EIGHTH._,Book Twenty-Third of the Iliad. Contests of strength and skill they
4549,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"are, showing the body under control of mind and manifesting the same up"
4550,_BOOK EIGHTH._,to a certain point. They have an artistic side and train the man
4551,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"physically, requiring also no little mental alertness."
4552,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4553,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"When the Phæacian contestants had finished, there was an attempt to"
4554,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"bring Ulysses into the game and have him show what he was, but he"
4555,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"declined the courteous invitation; ""cares are in my mind more than"
4556,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"games."" Then Euryalus taunts him with being a merchant, or robber, and"
4557,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"no athlete. Ulysses makes a caustic reply, picks up the quoit, and"
4558,_BOOK EIGHTH._,hurls it far beyond the marks of the others; then with some display of
4559,_BOOK EIGHTH._,temper he challenges any of the Phæacians present to any kind of
4560,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"contest. He even becomes boastful, and tells what he is ready to do in"
4561,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"the way of games; still further, he can shoot the bow and throw the"
4562,_BOOK EIGHTH._,javelin in heroic fashion--which accomplishments he will employ with
4563,_BOOK EIGHTH._,telling effect against the suitors hereafter.
4564,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4565,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"Alcinous pacifies him with gentle words, and proceeds to withdraw all"
4566,_BOOK EIGHTH._,his previous claims extolling Phæacian athletic skill. The soft arts of
4567,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"peace are theirs; ""in boxing and in wrestling we have small fame;"" but"
4568,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"on the other hand ""we delight in feasts, we love the harp and dance;"""
4569,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"new clothes are in favor, and ""we like the warm bath and bed."" Very"
4570,_BOOK EIGHTH._,different is now the call of King Alcinous from that last one: let the
4571,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"stranger see ""how much we excel others in the dance and song,"" to which"
4572,_BOOK EIGHTH._,is strangely added seamanship. Such is the preparation for the lay of
4573,_BOOK EIGHTH._,the loves of Mars and Venus.
4574,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4575,_BOOK EIGHTH._,Through these games the heroic strand in the stranger has been brought
4576,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"to light, somewhat in contrast with the Phæacians. As he had a contest"
4577,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"of mind with Achilles at Troy, so he has now a contest which shows his"
4578,_BOOK EIGHTH._,physical might; he is no weakling in spite of his intellect. Pallas too
4579,_BOOK EIGHTH._,"does not fail him, she marks his superiority in the throw of his quoit,"
4580,_BOOK EIGHTH._,and thus inspires him with courage.
4581,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4582,_BOOK EIGHTH._,
4583,II.,II.
4584,II.,
4585,II.,"We have now reached the second song of the bard, for the way has been"
4586,II.,smoothed by the preceding description of the luxurious delights of the
4587,II.,"Phæacians. It is often called the Loves of Venus and Mars, or the"
4588,II.,Adulterers caught on Olympus. From time immemorial much doubt of
4589,II.,"various sorts, poetical, moral, philological, has been cast upon this"
4590,II.,"song. Some ancient commentators have regarded it an interpolation, not"
4591,II.,a genuine part of Homer; modern expositors have not hesitated to follow
4592,II.,the same opinion.
4593,II.,
4594,II.,And indeed there are strong grounds for suspicion. Almost every reader
4595,II.,feels at the first perusal its jar with the general character of this
4596,II.,idyllic Phæacian world; it is decidedly adverse to the spirit of Arete
4597,II.,"and Nausicaa, as previously unfolded; the fact would almost seem"
4598,II.,"impossible that, in an atmosphere created chiefly by these two women,"
4599,II.,there could be such a kind of artistic enjoyment. The most conservative
4600,II.,reader is inclined here to agree with those who perform an act of
4601,II.,excision upon the text of Homer. The whole passage grates too harshly
4602,II.,upon nerves which have been attuned to the sweet innocent life depicted
4603,II.,in the two preceding Books.
4604,II.,
4605,II.,The objections to the song may be summed up in the following heads. (1)
4606,II.,It is inconsistent and deeply discordant with the ethical tone of
4607,II.,"Phæacia already given. (2) It does not further Ulysses in any way, it"
4608,II.,"shows no trait in his character, unless his faint approval signifies"
4609,II.,his liking for such songs. Nor does it seem on the surface to connect
4610,II.,"him with Troy, as do the other two songs of Demodocus. (3) It gives an"
4611,II.,"unworthy view of the Gods, degrading them far below Homer's general"
4612,II.,"level, reducing them to ordinary burlesque figures which violate all"
4613,II.,"decency, not to speak of morality. (4) Philologists have picked out"
4614,II.,"certain words and expressions peculiar to this passage, which, not"
4615,II.,"being employed by Homer elsewhere, tend to indicate some other author."
4616,II.,
4617,II.,"Still, if the passage be an interpolation, this must have taken place"
4618,II.,early in the history of the poems. Pausanias the traveler declares that
4619,II.,he saw the dancing scene of the Phæacians depicted upon the throne of
4620,II.,"Apollo at Amyclæ, the artist of which probably flourished about 600 B."
4621,II.,"C. The old philosopher Heraclitus, who would scourge Homer from the"
4622,II.,"festivals of the Gods, doubtless had this passage in mind. Plato"
4623,II.,"censures its indecency specially, and, as is well known, would exclude"
4624,II.,all Homer from his ideal Republic. The ancients thus accepted the
4625,II.,"passage as Homeric, with the exception of some of the later"
4626,II.,grammarians.
4627,II.,
4628,II.,"Next come the many attempts, old and new, to allegorize the Olympian"
4629,II.,"scene, or to explain it away. From the fact that the sun keeps watch"
4630,II.,"and is mentioned twice in this part, the latest school of mythologists,"
4631,II.,"the comparative so-called, have taken much comfort, and have at once"
4632,II.,"found in the whole a sun-myth. Some ancient expositors, according to"
4633,II.,"Athenæus, interpreted it as a story written for the purpose of"
4634,II.,"deterring the listeners from doing similar bad deeds, pointing to the"
4635,II.,punishment even of Gods herein designated; thus they sought to save the
4636,II.,"credit of Homer, treating him quite as some commentators have treated"
4637,II.,certain morally questionable stories in the Bible. Thus along down the
4638,II.,ages to the present the loves of Venus and Mars have created trouble.
4639,II.,
4640,II.,Undoubtedly the song has meaning and deserves a rational exposition.
4641,II.,"Has it any connection with the other songs of this Book, or with Homer"
4642,II.,in general? It is certainly a product of early Greek poesy; can it be
4643,II.,organically jointed into anything before it and after it? The burlesque
4644,II.,tone which it assumes towards certain Olympians has caused it to be
4645,II.,"connected with the Battle of the Frogs and Mice, and with the war of"
4646,II.,"the Gods in the Iliad (Book Twenty-First). Let us extend our horizon,"
4647,II.,and take a new look in various directions.
4648,II.,
4649,II.,In the first place this song connects with Troy and the Iliad like the
4650,II.,other two songs of Demodocus. The cause of the Trojan War and of its
4651,II.,"poem was the deed of Paris. The seducer, the wife, the husband--Paris,"
4652,II.,"Helen, Manelaus--are the three central figures of the legend. Here this"
4653,II.,"legend is thrown up among the Gods themselves, who furnish three"
4654,II.,"corresponding characters--Mars, Venus, Vulcan. Then there is the wrong"
4655,II.,and the punishment of the wrong in both cases. Such is the theme of the
4656,II.,Trojan War as it appears in the Iliad. Thus the three songs of
4657,II.,"Demodocus indicate a Pre-Iliad, an Iliad, and a Post-Iliad in due"
4658,II.,order.
4659,II.,
4660,II.,In the second place one asks very emphatically: Why this present
4661,II.,treatment of the Gods on Homer's part? But here we must make an
4662,II.,"important distinction. The Supreme God, Zeus, does not appear, nor does"
4663,II.,"Juno nor does Pallas, indeed none of the Goddesses except the guilty"
4664,II.,one. The disgrace falls upon two mainly: Mars and Venus. In the Iliad
4665,II.,"they are Trojan deities hostile to the Greeks, and here the Greek poet"
4666,II.,"serves them up together in an intermezzo, which makes them comic."
4667,II.,Indeed the Greek Hero Diomed fights and puts down just these two Trojan
4668,II.,deities in the Fifth Book of the Iliad. So must every Greek Hero at
4669,II.,"Troy conquer Mars and Venus (Violence and Lust, to give a suggestion of"
4670,II.,their purport) before Helen can be restored to home and country; he
4671,II.,"must put down the hostile city and its Gods. Note too, whither the"
4672,II.,Greek poet sends each of these deities after their release: Mars flies
4673,II.,"off to Thrace, a distant, barbarous country, beyond the borders of"
4674,II.,"Hellas, where he can find his own; Venus on the contrary slips away"
4675,II.,"southeastward to Cyprus inhabited by peoples Oriental or Orientalizing,"
4676,II.,and therein like Troy and herself. Both rush out of Greece with all
4677,II.,speed; they belong somewhere in the outskirts of the Greek world.
4678,II.,
4679,II.,"We may now see why the Phæacians, without being so very wicked, could"
4680,II.,"find an element in the song which they enjoyed. To them, with the"
4681,II.,"Trojan War always in mind, this was the theme: the adulterous Trojan"
4682,II.,deities caught and laughed out of Olympus--those being the two deities
4683,II.,who first misled by desire and then tried to keep by war the beautiful
4684,II.,"Helen, the Greek woman. Throwing ourselves back into his spirit, we may"
4685,II.,"also see why Ulysses, the old war-horse from Troy, ""was rejoiced in his"
4686,II.,"heart, hearing the song"" which degraded and burlesqued the Gods whom he"
4687,II.,"had fought ten years, and who were, in part at least, the occasion of"
4688,II.,his wandering ten more. Venus and Mars did not find much sympathy in
4689,II.,"the Phæacian company, we may be sure. Why then regard them as Gods? The"
4690,II.,Greek deified everything; even the tendencies which he felt himself
4691,II.,"obliged to suppress had something of the divine in them. Calypso, whom"
4692,II.,"Ulysses subordinated at last to the higher principle, was a Goddess;"
4693,II.,"Troy, the hostile city, had its deities, whom the Greek recognised. Now"
4694,II.,"its two chief deities are involved in a common shame, and flee from"
4695,II.,"Olympus, flee almost outside of the Greek world. Certainly the audience"
4696,II.,could take some ethical satisfaction in that.
4697,II.,
4698,II.,"Then there is a third consideration different from the two preceding,"
4699,II.,both of which seek to look at the song from the ancient Greek
4700,II.,standpoint. But from our modern standpoint it is also to be regarded.
4701,II.,There is no doubt that we see here the beginning of the end of
4702,II.,"polytheism; the many Gods collide with one another, some are now put"
4703,II.,out and all will be finally put out; they are showing their finitude
4704,II.,"and transitoriness. Still further, we catch a glimpse of the sensuous"
4705,II.,"side of Greek life, the excess of which at last brought death. Homer is"
4706,II.,"the prophet of his people, when read with insight; he tells not only"
4707,II.,"what they are, but hints what they are to become."
4708,II.,
4709,II.,"In general, we pass in this second part of the present Book as we have"
4710,II.,"divided it, to the sensuous element of the Phæacian world, the"
4711,II.,"inactive, quiet, self-indulgent phase, in decided contrast to the"
4712,II.,preceding part which shows a love of manly action in games and in war.
4713,II.,Let us still further develop the twofold way in which this fact is
4714,II.,brought out.
4715,II.,
4716,II.,1. The second song of Demodocus has the general theme of the Trojan War
4717,II.,and suggests the grand event of the aforetime. It manifestly carries
4718,II.,the Trojan scission into Olympus and drives out in disgrace the Trojan
4719,II.,"deities. Vulcan, the wronged husband, is the divine artificer; he makes"
4720,II.,"a network of chains which could not be broken, ""like a spider's web, so"
4721,II.,"fine that no one could see it, not even a God;"" in this snare the"
4722,II.,"guilty deities are caught, exposed, punished. These invisible, yet"
4723,II.,"unbreakable chains have an ethical suggestion, and hint the law which"
4724,II.,"is also to be executed on Olympus, as it was below in Troy. As Vulcan"
4725,II.,"is the artist among the Gods, we are prompted to find also an artistic"
4726,II.,bearing in the scene; the artist catches the wrong-doers by his art and
4727,II.,"holds them fast in a marvelous net where they still lie, and shall lie"
4728,II.,for all time; even the intercession of Neptune cannot get them free.
4729,II.,The scene is indeed caught out of the reality and holds to-day; the
4730,II.,"dashing, finely-uniformed son of Mars (so called at present) is most"
4731,II.,"apt to win the heart of the gay, fashionable, beautiful daughter of"
4732,II.,"Venus, have an escapade, and cause a scandal. Oft too they are caught"
4733,II.,"in our modern, most adroitly woven spider's web, which goes under the"
4734,II.,"name of newspaper, and held up, if not before a seeing Olympus, at"
4735,II.,"least before a reading public, which not seldom indulges in"
4736,II.,conversation very much in the style of the Gods as here set forth. We
4737,II.,"moderns do not go to the market-place to hear such a strain, but have"
4738,II.,it brought to us in the Morning Journal. One advantage the Phæacian
4739,II.,"had: Arete and Nausicaa did not go to the market-place, where this song"
4740,II.,"was sung, only men were there, but the print will enter the household"
4741,II.,"where are wife and daughter. At any rate, we have to pronounce the song"
4742,II.,"of Demodocus typical, universal, nay, ethical in spite of its"
4743,II.,"light-hearted raillery, inasmuch as the deed is regarded as a breach of"
4744,II.,"divine law, is exposed and punished, and the recompense for the release"
4745,II.,"of the guilty pair, the penalty, is duly stated in accordance with law."
4746,II.,"Not every modern story-teller is so scrupulous, in meting out justice"
4747,II.,to ethical violation.
4748,II.,
4749,II.,"2. So much for the song; we turn again to the Phæacians, who are not"
4750,II.,"now engaged in athletic, but in a milder sport, the dance. Youths moved"
4751,II.,their bodies in tune to the strain; still in Greece the dance and the
4752,II.,"song often go together. Then two danced alone without the song, but"
4753,II.,"employed a ball, tossing it from one to the other, for the amusement of"
4754,II.,the spectators. A rhythmical movement of the body in the dance shows
4755,II.,"more internality than the athletic game, but it is less hardy, is more"
4756,II.,indicative of luxury and effeminacy.
4757,II.,
4758,II.,"On account of these enjoyments, which have been unrolled before us in"
4759,II.,"so many striking pictures, the Phæacians have been regarded by some"
4760,II.,writers both in ancient and modern times as the mythical Sybarites
4761,II.,devoted simply to a life of pleasure. The love of the warm bath and
4762,II.,"clean clothes, the dance and the song, above all the second lay of"
4763,II.,Demodocus have given them a bad name. Heraclides Ponticus derived their
4764,II.,"whole polity of non-intercourse, of concealment, of sending away the"
4765,II.,"stranger as soon as possible out of their island, from their desire to"
4766,II.,"resign themselves more completely to their luxurious habits, without"
4767,II.,foreign disturbance. Horace expresses a similar view of this people.
4768,II.,Nitzsch in Commentary (_ad loc._) defends the Phæacians warmly against
4769,II.,"the charge, and the view that Arete and Nausicaa cannot be products of"
4770,II.,"a corrupt society holds good. An idyllic people, not by any means"
4771,II.,"enervated, though pleasure-loving--so we must regard them. That lay of"
4772,II.,"the bard, rightly looked into, does not tell against them as strongly"
4773,II.,as is sometimes supposed. Still Heraclides touched upon a limitation of
4774,II.,"Phæacia in his criticism, it refused to join the family of nations,"
4775,II.,it sought to be a kind of little China and keep all to itself. It
4776,II.,"had solved, however, the problem of external war and of internal"
4777,II.,dissension; no dispute with neighboring nations about commercial
4778,II.,"privileges, no local strife which cannot be settled by Arete. The poet"
4779,II.,has as nearly as possible succeeded in eliminating the negative element
4780,II.,"out of this society. An unwarlike folk, but not effeminate, happy in"
4781,II.,"peace, with a childlike delight in play, which is the starting-point of"
4782,II.,"art, and remains its substrate, according to Schiller; truly idyllic it"
4783,II.,"must be regarded, a land on the way between nature and civilization,"
4784,II.,"where life is a perpetual holiday, and even labor takes on a festal"
4785,II.,appearance.
4786,II.,
4787,II.,"Ulysses gives the palm of excellence in the dance to the Phæacians, and"
4788,II.,with this recognition the king proposes a large number of
4789,II.,"presents--hospitable gifts, such as the host gives to his honored"
4790,II.,guest. Moreover an apology and a gift are required of that Euryalus who
4791,II.,recently offended Ulysses. Thus reconciliation is the word and the
4792,II.,deed. Then all are ready to return to the palace into the presence of
4793,II.,"Arete, who is the orderer, and she makes arrangements for packing up"
4794,II.,"the gifts. Note the warm bath again, supposed sign of effeminacy; here"
4795,II.,"it is taken by Ulysses with decided approbation. Nausicaa, too, appears"
4796,II.,"in a passing glance, and simply asks to be remembered for her deed; the"
4797,II.,"response of Ulysses is emphatic: when he gets home he ""will pray to her"
4798,II.,"as to a God day by day, for thou, O maiden, hast saved my life."""
4799,II.,
4800,II.,"In this round of recognition, the bard must not be forgotten; he is"
4801,II.,"again led in, a banquet is served, and Ulysses takes special pains to"
4802,II.,"honor him ""with a part of the fat back of a white-tusked boar,"" and to"
4803,II.,"speak a strong word of commendation: ""Demodocus, I praise thee above"
4804,II.,"all mortals; either the Muse or Apollo has taught thee, so well dost"
4805,II.,"thou sing the fate of the Greeks."""
4806,II.,
4807,II.,
4808,III.,III.
4809,III.,
4810,III.,The praise of the bard naturally leads to the third portion of the
4811,III.,"Book, introduced by another song, which has its intimate connection"
4812,III.,"with the preceding ones. Then its effect is noted upon Ulysses, who"
4813,III.,"weeps as before, being stirred by many memories of companions lost."
4814,III.,Verily Troy is a tearful subject. What motive for weeping? Who is this
4815,III.,stranger anyhow? Alcinous now starts his interrogations which Ulysses
4816,III.,"answers in the following Book. Still, though nameless, he has unfolded"
4817,III.,himself quite fully through his actions in this Book. Again we hear the
4818,III.,"deeds of the aforetime sung by the poet, and see their influence in the"
4819,III.,present.
4820,III.,
4821,III.,1. Ulysses himself now asks the poet to sing of the Wooden Horse which
4822,III.,"""was made by Epeius with the aid of Pallas,"" the Goddess here standing"
4823,III.,"for skill, as it is now skill which takes Troy, not mere courage. Then"
4824,III.,mark further: Ulysses was the man who introduced it within the Trojan
4825,III.,walls by stratagem--clearly another case of brain-work rather than
4826,III.,"brawn-work. This famous Wooden Horse was ""filled with men who took"
4827,III.,"Troy."" Such is the song which Ulysses now calls for, mentioning himself"
4828,III.,by name--a fact which makes the announcement of his name soon after
4829,III.,more impressive and dramatic. The Phæacians had just heard the
4830,III.,"culminating act in the taking of Troy, whereof Ulysses was the hero;"
4831,III.,"behold! he stands before them, in all the prestige of song. Some"
4832,III.,"critics have wondered why the name of Ulysses was withheld so long, and"
4833,III.,have imagined all sorts of interpolations; surely they have not seen
4834,III.,the plan of the poet.
4835,III.,
4836,III.,"The Wooden Horse is not employed in the Iliad, but is one of the"
4837,III.,"striking details of the later epics, which recounted the destruction of"
4838,III.,Troy. The song of Demodocus carries the incident back to the time of
4839,III.,"Homer, and before Homer, for it suggests antecedent ballads or"
4840,III.,"rhapsodies which Homer knew, but did not use, and which poets after him"
4841,III.,developed. The Odyssey takes for granted that its hearers knew the Lay
4842,III.,"of the Wooden Horse, and also the Lay of the Strife between Ulysses and"
4843,III.,"Achilles, ""the fame of which had reached the broad Heavens."" Thus we"
4844,III.,get a peep into the workshop of Homer and catch a glimpse of his
4845,III.,"materials, which he did not invent, but found at hand. Homer is the"
4846,III.,"builder, the architectonic genius; he organizes the floating, disparate"
4847,III.,"songs of his age into a great totality, into a Greek Temple of which"
4848,III.,they are the stones. Note what he does with this lay of Demodocus; he
4849,III.,"puts it into its place in the total structure of the Odyssey, and thus"
4850,III.,preserves it forever. So he has done with all his materials doubtless.
4851,III.,
4852,III.,We may now see that those who cut up the Homeric poems into so many
4853,III.,different songs or ballads simply destroy the distinctive work of
4854,III.,"Homer. They pry asunder the beautiful Greek Temple, lay its stones"
4855,III.,"alongside of one another, and say: behold the poet. But this is just"
4856,III.,"what he is not, and in the present Book we may see him unfolding his"
4857,III.,"own process. Homer is not Demodocus, but the latter's lay he takes up"
4858,III.,and then weaves what he wants of it into the texture of the total poem.
4859,III.,"He is thus a contrast to the bard, whom, however, he fully recognizes"
4860,III.,and makes a part of his own work. Thus Homer himself really answers the
4861,III.,"Wolfian theory, which seeks to reduce him to a Demodocus, singing"
4862,III.,fragmentary lays about the Trojan War.
4863,III.,
4864,III.,"From the Greek poets the Wooden Horse passed to Virgil, who has made it"
4865,III.,the best-known incident of the Trojan War. It is probably the most
4866,III.,"famous stratagem of all time, due to the skill of Ulysses. Herein lies"
4867,III.,the answer to the first lay of Demodocus; in the dispute Ulysses is
4868,III.,"right, indeed he is a greater hero than Achilles, who could never have"
4869,III.,captured the hostile city. The incident took place after the action of
4870,III.,"the Iliad, and after the death of Achilles, who, heroic in courage,"
4871,III.,"stood in the way of intelligence. When he is gone, the city falls,"
4872,III.,overthrown by the brain of Ulysses.
4873,III.,
4874,III.,"Homer does not pretend to give the song of Demodocus in full, but a"
4875,III.,"brief summary of what he sang before the Phæacians. A later poet,"
4876,III.,"Arctinus, took up the legend here alluded to, and developed it in a"
4877,III.,"separate epic, called the Iliou-persis or Sack of Troy. Indeed a vast"
4878,III.,"number of legends and lays about the Trojan War bloomed into epics,"
4879,III.,which were in later times joined together and called the Epic Cycle.
4880,III.,Thus we distinguish two very different stages of consciousness in early
4881,III.,"Greek poetry: the ballad-making and the epical, Homer being the supreme"
4882,III.,"example of the latter, and Demodocus an instance of the former."
4883,III.,
4884,III.,Looking back at the three lays of the bard in the present Book we find
4885,III.,that they all are connected together in a common theme of which they
4886,III.,"show different phases, beginning, middle and end--the conflict before"
4887,III.,"the Iliad, the conflict of the Iliad, and the conflict after the Iliad,"
4888,III.,"all hovering around the great national enterprise of the Greeks, namely"
4889,III.,"the Trojan War, in which the deepest principle of the Hellenic world,"
4890,III.,"indeed of the entire Occident, was at stake."
4891,III.,
4892,III.,"But Homer, in distinction from Demodocus, weaves into his poem not only"
4893,III.,"the past but the present, not only Troy but Phæacia, not only the"
4894,III.,"movement against the East but also the movement toward the West, of"
4895,III.,which Phæacia is simply one stage. The Hero who unites these two great
4896,III.,movements of Greek spirit is now brought before us again.
4897,III.,
4898,III.,2. Ulysses weeps at the song of the bard which recalls so many memories
4899,III.,of friends departed and of dire calamities. These tears connect him
4900,III.,"deeply with Troy and its conflict; the Phæacians listen intently, but"
4901,III.,"are outside of the great struggle, they shed no tears. Thus does"
4902,III.,Ulysses in his strongest emotions unite himself with the Trojan
4903,III.,enterprise of aforetime. He is not simply a wanderer over the sea
4904,III.,"seeking to get home, but a returner from Troy; he has revealed himself"
4905,III.,through his feelings. He personally shares in the woes sung by the
4906,III.,"bard, because he has experienced them. Indeed the very image which the"
4907,III.,"poet here employs to express sorrow, taken from the woman whose husband"
4908,III.,"has been slain fighting for his city, and for his wife and his"
4909,III.,"children, recalls Hector, Andromache and Astyanax as they appear in the"
4910,III.,"Sixth Book of the Iliad. Ulysses is like such a woman, without home or"
4911,III.,"family, alone among strangers, shedding tears. Thus he connects himself"
4912,III.,with the fateful story of Ilium.
4913,III.,
4914,III.,"Previously Ulysses wept at the first lay of Demodocus, now he"
4915,III.,emphasizes his sorrow by repetition. Whenever the theme of Troy is
4916,III.,"touched, he has to respond with tears; the second time of weeping at"
4917,III.,the Trojan tale is necessary in order to fix his character and identify
4918,III.,him as a returner. Yet this repetition so vitally organic is questioned
4919,III.,"by many critics, some of whom resort to excision. It is hardly worth"
4920,III.,the while to notice them in their various attempts at destruction and
4921,III.,construction; when we once catch the underlying motive all becomes
4922,III.,"plain. The first and last scenes of weeping unifies the Book, the bond"
4923,III.,of tears holds its parts indissolubly together in the emotions.
4924,III.,
4925,III.,"Alcinous has observed the stranger both times, sitting near him, while"
4926,III.,"we may suppose that the other Phæacians, not noticing him, to be"
4927,III.,further off. The king sees his distress and even hears his sobs; in the
4928,III.,"first case the royal host refrained from inquiry, that being the duty"
4929,III.,of hospitality; but now the time for interrogation has arrived. The
4930,III.,"speech of Alcinous is characteristic; full of humanity, full of"
4931,III.,"sympathy is the tone: ""a guest, a suppliant stands for a brother even"
4932,III.,"to the man of little feeling."" A touch of prophetic boastfulness he"
4933,III.,shows here and elsewhere; the ships of the Phæacians he endows with
4934,III.,"supernatural powers, which fact, however, is not without meaning: ""We"
4935,III.,"have no pilots, no rudders even, our boats obey our thoughts, and know"
4936,III.,the cities and lands to which they come; very quickly do they shoot
4937,III.,"across the wave, hid in fog and cloud."" Truly an ideal ship, which time"
4938,III.,"has not yet realized, though recent navigation, with its present steam"
4939,III.,"and its future electricity, is on the way thereto. Still angry Neptune"
4940,III.,"threatens danger and may work damage, ""smiting the ship on the dark"
4941,III.,"deep."" This speech of Alcinous with its miraculous, prophetic tinge,"
4942,III.,"with its far-seeing hints of coming realities, almost foretelling our"
4943,III.,"modern humanity and our modern mastery of the sea through science, and"
4944,III.,"putting the two side by side, has given much trouble to the critics,"
4945,III.,"whom we again shall have to pass by, as they simply darken the poet."
4946,III.,
4947,III.,Finally comes the demand: who art thou and why didst thou weep? What is
4948,III.,thy relation to Troy? Such is the culminating question; Ulysses has
4949,III.,been unfolding himself more and more throughout the present Book before
4950,III.,the king and people. The games showed his heroic strength; the dances
4951,III.,brought out his recognizing and harmonious spirit; the lays of
4952,III.,Demodocus have developed his connection with Troy. He clearly belongs
4953,III.,"to the past and to the present, possibly he is a bridge spanning them,"
4954,III.,which bridge he may be induced to build in wondrous rainbow colors
4955,III.,before the eyes of the Phæacians.
4956,III.,
4957,III.,_Appendix._ It seems never to have been noticed what an important
4958,III.,relation the present Book sustains toward the Wolfian theory concerning
4959,III.,the Homeric poems. The picture of Demodocus here given doubtless
4960,III.,"suggested to Wolf the first outline of his view, and has influenced"
4961,III.,other commentators who lean toward similar opinions. It is well known
4962,III.,that Wolf in his famous _Prolegomena_ maintains that the Iliad and
4963,III.,"Odyssey were originally a string of ballads more or less disconnected,"
4964,III.,"and that Homer was only one of the many balladists, probably the best;"
4965,III.,"furthermore he holds that these ballads were brought together, edited"
4966,III.,and put into their present shape by certain literary men called
4967,III.,"_diaskeuastoe_--revisers, redactors, professors of poetry and philology"
4968,III.,"at the court of Peisistratus, about 500 B.C."
4969,III.,
4970,III.,"That is, Wolf regards Homer as a Demodocus, a singer and also a maker"
4971,III.,"of disjointed ballads and war-songs, the latter pertaining mostly to"
4972,III.,the heroes of the Trojan War. These were sung at the festivals of the
4973,III.,"people, at the houses of the nobility, and at the courts of kings,"
4974,III.,quite as we see the bard singing here in Phæacia. This fact we may
4975,III.,accept; but the question comes up: Is Homer such a balladist and
4976,III.,nothing more?
4977,III.,
4978,III.,"Now it is clear that Homer is not a Demodocus, since the latter is not"
4979,III.,"an epical builder, but a simple singer of separate lays for the"
4980,III.,"occasion. Mark well that Homer in this book does not unfold the themes,"
4981,III.,"""Strife between Ulysses and Achilles,"" and ""The Wooden Horse,"" but"
4982,III.,simply alludes to them as well-known; he barely gives the title and a
4983,III.,"little of the argument, then drops the matter, leaving us to suppose"
4984,III.,"that the Bard sang a somewhat lengthy lay, of which the effect upon the"
4985,III.,hearers and specially upon Ulysses is duly noted.
4986,III.,
4987,III.,"Homer, therefore, in this Book as well as in the First Book where"
4988,III.,"Phemius is introduced, makes the Bard or Balladist merely one of his"
4989,III.,"figures, and the song one of his incidents, while he, the veritable"
4990,III.,"Homer, portrays the total environment, showing the court, the games,"
4991,III.,"the household, the complete Phæacian world. Here we come upon the main"
4992,III.,distinction: Homer's eye is upon the totality of which the
4993,III.,ballad-singer is but a small fragment; Demodocus appears in but one
4994,III.,"Phæacian Book, and is by no means all of that, though for once the"
4995,III.,leading figure.
4996,III.,
4997,III.,A step further we may carry the thought. Homer is not only not a
4998,III.,"Demodocus, but he very distinctly contrasts himself with Demodocus by"
4999,III.,his poetic procedure. If he is at such pains to show himself a
5000,III.,"world-builder, and then puts into his world a ballad-singer as a"
5001,III.,"passing character, he certainly emphasizes the difference between"
5002,III.,himself and the latter. It is also to be noticed that Demodocus does
5003,III.,"not sing an Iliad, though he chants lays of Troy; the Iliad is an"
5004,III.,"organized work, not a collection of ballads strung together. Everything"
5005,III.,about Demodocus indicates separate songs; everything about Homer (the
5006,III.,Iliad and the Odyssey) indicates unity of song. Hence with the
5007,III.,"separatists, dissectors, anatomizers, Demodocus is a greater favorite"
5008,III.,"than Homer, indeed he has taken the place of Homer."
5009,III.,
5010,III.,"Moreover the poet has plainly marked another stage, a stage between"
5011,III.,himself and Demodocus. In the next Book Ulysses will begin singing and
5012,III.,"continue through four Books, giving his adventures in Fableland, which"
5013,III.,by itself possesses a certain completeness. Still it is but an organic
5014,III.,"part of the total Odyssey, whose poetical architect is Homer. Ulysses"
5015,III.,"as singer is clearly higher than Demodocus; but Homer is above both,"
5016,III.,"for he takes both of them up into his unity, which is the all-embracing"
5017,III.,poem.
5018,III.,
5019,III.,"Most emphatically, therefore, Homer shows himself not to be a"
5020,III.,"Demodocus, not to be a ballad-singer, which is an essential point in"
5021,III.,"the Wolfian argument. Homer himself refutes Wolf some 2,500 years"
5022,III.,"beforehand, and his is still the best refutation. A careful study of"
5023,III.,this Eighth Book settles the relation between balladist and poet by a
5024,III.,"simple presentation of the facts in their proper co-ordination, and"
5025,III.,also puts the alert reader on the track of the genesis of the Wolfian
5026,III.,"_Prolegomena_. For there can hardly be a doubt that Wolf, consciously"
5027,III.,"or unconsciously, directly or indirectly, derived his main conception"
5028,III.,"of Homer from the present Book and from the part that Demodocus, the"
5029,III.,"bard, plays in it. To be sure, the idea that Demodocus, in a general"
5030,III.,"way, is Homer, is old, coming down from antiquity and suggesting itself"
5031,III.,"to the modern reader, who very naturally thinks that Homer is giving"
5032,III.,some traits of himself in his picture of the blind singer. So much we
5033,III.,"may grant: some traits of himself, but not all by any means; Homer"
5034,III.,doubtless upon occasion could sing a short lay of Troy for the
5035,III.,"amusement of his audience, like Demodocus; but in such a part he is"
5036,III.,"only a wee fragment of the author of those magnificent works, the Iliad"
5037,III.,"and the Odyssey. The total Homer builds totalities, by the very"
5038,III.,necessity of his genius.
5039,III.,
5040,III.,"Who, then, according to the theory, put these ballads together? Wolf,"
5041,III.,"fully possessed of the notion that Demodocus is Homer, starts to"
5042,III.,"account for the present form of the poems, which he assigns to the"
5043,III.,"shaping hand of Peisistratus and his college of editors, critics, and"
5044,III.,"poetasters. That is, the grand marvel of Homeric poetry, the mighty"
5045,III.,"constructive act thereof, he ascribes to a set of men essentially"
5046,III.,"barren and uncreative, for all of which he cites some very dubious and"
5047,III.,inadequate ancient authority.
5048,III.,
5049,III.,Here again we may be permitted to trace the Wolfian consciousness to
5050,III.,"its origin, for origin it has in time and circumstance. Wolf was a"
5051,III.,"professor in a University, and his department was philology; his ideas"
5052,III.,on Homer are really drawn from his vocation and his surroundings. Why
5053,III.,should he not make a philologer and a professor the author of the
5054,III.,Homeric poems? So he came to imagine that the tyrant Peisistratus 500
5055,III.,"B.C. had under his patronage a kind of German University, or at least"
5056,III.,"a philological seminary, whose professors really constructed Homer as"
5057,III.,"we now have him, having put him together out of antecedent ballads"
5058,III.,"which the actual Homer and many others may have made ages before. Wolf,"
5059,III.,"therefore, is the founder of two philological seminaries; one at the"
5060,III.,"University of Berlin, and the other at the court of Peisistratus. Great"
5061,III.,is the professor in smelling out the professor anywhere; still we
5062,III.,"cannot help thinking that what Wolf ascribed to the old Greek seminary,"
5063,III.,"was done only at his German seminary, namely, the patching together of"
5064,III.,Homer out of ballads.

5072,_FABLELAND._,"The movement of the second grand division of the poem, the Ulyssiad,"
5073,_FABLELAND._,"has passed through two of its stages, which have been already"
5074,_FABLELAND._,"considered; the third is now reached which we have called Fableland,"
5075,_FABLELAND._,though it may be said that the two previous lands are also fabulous.
5076,_FABLELAND._,"Let it then be named the Fairy World, though this term also does not"
5077,_FABLELAND._,state or suggest the fact with precision. Without troubling ourselves
5078,_FABLELAND._,"further about names, we shall proceed to seize the meaning by an"
5079,_FABLELAND._,exposition given in some detail.
5080,_FABLELAND._,
5081,_FABLELAND._,No careful reader can doubt that the poem changes decidedly at the
5082,_FABLELAND._,"present juncture in color, style, environment and purpose. What reason"
5083,_FABLELAND._,for it? And what is the connection with the preceding portion of the
5084,_FABLELAND._,"poem? Four Books (IX-XII) of the same character essentially, unfold"
5085,_FABLELAND._,themselves before us and demand a new kind of appreciation; they are
5086,_FABLELAND._,"not idyllic, not epical; they form a class of a peculiar sort, which"
5087,_FABLELAND._,"class, however, we have before noticed in the Odyssey, showing itself"
5088,_FABLELAND._,in short but suggestive interludes.
5089,_FABLELAND._,
5090,_FABLELAND._,"We shall, accordingly, first grapple with the leading facts of this new"
5091,_FABLELAND._,"poetic order and seek to interpret them, or rather let them interpret"
5092,_FABLELAND._,"themselves. Phæacia, which we have just seen, lies before Fableland,"
5093,_FABLELAND._,though the story of the latter is now told in Phæacia.
5094,_FABLELAND._,
5095,_FABLELAND._,1. The first fact which strikes us is the decided contrast between the
5096,_FABLELAND._,"two realms. Phæacia is the land of pure idyllic delight, its supreme"
5097,_FABLELAND._,"characteristic is peace, its happy people seem to have no conflict;"
5098,_FABLELAND._,"Fableland, on the contrary, is one incessant course of strife, struggle"
5099,_FABLELAND._,"and calamity, beginning with the unprovoked attack on the Ciconians."
5100,_FABLELAND._,Polyphemus the savage Cyclops is the opposite of the civil ruler
5101,_FABLELAND._,"Alcinous; Circe, the enchantress, is the insidious foe to domestic life"
5102,_FABLELAND._,represented by Arete; State and Family in Phæacia are counterbalanced
5103,_FABLELAND._,by an anti-State and an anti-Family in Fableland. Thus man and woman
5104,_FABLELAND._,are shown in the two different places as institutional and
5105,_FABLELAND._,anti-institutional. Still deeper does the opposition reach; Phæacia
5106,_FABLELAND._,"lies wholly in the Upperworld, with its sweet sunlight, while Fableland"
5107,_FABLELAND._,"has a dim Underworld, beyond the sunlight, the realm of the"
5108,_FABLELAND._,Supersensible; finally Fableland witnesses the supreme negative act of
5109,_FABLELAND._,"man, typified in the slaying of the Oxen of the Sun. We may, therefore,"
5110,_FABLELAND._,"affirm that Fableland, as compared with Phæacia, shadows forth the"
5111,_FABLELAND._,realm of negation; the one stands for the ideal Greek world of ethical
5112,_FABLELAND._,order and harmony; the other is the denial and destruction of the same.
5113,_FABLELAND._,
5114,_FABLELAND._,But we must not omit the reverse side of the contrast. In Fableland
5115,_FABLELAND._,"there is one continued striving of the human soul, a chafing against"
5116,_FABLELAND._,"all limits, a moving forward from one stage to another; the spirit of"
5117,_FABLELAND._,"man is shown transcending its bounds everywhere. In Phæacia, however,"
5118,_FABLELAND._,"there is no striving apparently, it is contented with itself and stays"
5119,_FABLELAND._,"with itself, seeking no neighbors; it is the land of rest, of cessation"
5120,_FABLELAND._,"from conflict, possibly of stagnation, unless it is stirred by inner"
5121,_FABLELAND._,scission.
5122,_FABLELAND._,
5123,_FABLELAND._,"The transition from Phæacia to Fableland is, therefore, full of"
5124,_FABLELAND._,meaning. It is possible that Ulysses or the poet wished to show these
5125,_FABLELAND._,"people the struggles which were slumbering in their society, for all"
5126,_FABLELAND._,civilized order has the possibility of them. The negative spirit will
5127,_FABLELAND._,rise hereafter in their midst; so it rose in legendary Greece after the
5128,_FABLELAND._,"Trojan War, so it rose in historical Greece after the Persian War. Thus"
5129,_FABLELAND._,we may catch a prophetic tinge in this web of marvelous tales. On the
5130,_FABLELAND._,"other hand, we should note also that Ulysses has reached the land of"
5131,_FABLELAND._,peace just through the realm of strife and negation.
5132,_FABLELAND._,
5133,_FABLELAND._,2. The next important thing is to observe how the poet is going to
5134,_FABLELAND._,"locate, and environ this negative world. As it is the opposite of the"
5135,_FABLELAND._,"civilized order of Hellas, he throws it outside of Hellenic boundaries."
5136,_FABLELAND._,Over the Greek border somewhere it has to be placed; thus it passes
5137,_FABLELAND._,"easily from the known to the unknown, out of the civilized to the"
5138,_FABLELAND._,"barbarous, out of the natural, to the supernatural."
5139,_FABLELAND._,
5140,_FABLELAND._,All this we feel at once in the narrative. It is true that the first
5141,_FABLELAND._,"destructive deed, the attack upon the Ciconians, occurs within the"
5142,_FABLELAND._,"limits of historical Hellas, in a region well known; but this act is"
5143,_FABLELAND._,"the prelude and the example, the offenders are at once borne to the"
5144,_FABLELAND._,"Lotus-eaters, who have the faintest touch of historical reality, and"
5145,_FABLELAND._,thence to Polyphemus who is wholly fabulous. In this realm of pure
5146,_FABLELAND._,"fable they stay till the end, having been cast out of Greece by the"
5147,_FABLELAND._,poet on account of their hostile spirit.
5148,_FABLELAND._,
5149,_FABLELAND._,"Moreover we should note that they move about on the sea, that most"
5150,_FABLELAND._,"unstable element, in contrast to the fixed land; on the one there is"
5151,_FABLELAND._,"order and law, on the other caprice and violence. Yet certain fixed"
5152,_FABLELAND._,"points are set in this uncertain domain, namely the islands, which"
5153,_FABLELAND._,"however, are wholly separated from Hellas and her life, and have"
5154,_FABLELAND._,"inhabitants of their own, strangers to Hellenic influence. Ulysses and"
5155,_FABLELAND._,"his crew will pass from island to island, each of which will show its"
5156,_FABLELAND._,meaning in some way antagonistic to Greek spirit. Out of the pale they
5157,_FABLELAND._,all lie in the boundless billowy waters; thus the Odyssey in this part
5158,_FABLELAND._,"becomes a sea poem, while in the other two parts it is essentially a"
5159,_FABLELAND._,land poem. The Greek was and still is a native of both sea and land
5160,_FABLELAND._,which are physically interwined and bound together in Greece as in no
5161,_FABLELAND._,other portion of the globe. His great poetical book envisages his
5162,_FABLELAND._,country as well as himself.
5163,_FABLELAND._,
5164,_FABLELAND._,"The main point, however, is that Fableland being negative to the Greek"
5165,_FABLELAND._,"world is put outside of all of its known geographical limits, and thus"
5166,_FABLELAND._,becomes the setting for the marvelous story. It may here be added that
5167,_FABLELAND._,Grimm's Tales have a similar border which lies between civilized life
5168,_FABLELAND._,"and the forest, since the forest was, for our Teutonic ancestors, the"
5169,_FABLELAND._,"fairy realm, in which their supernatural beings dwelt for the most"
5170,_FABLELAND._,part. Out of culture back to nature the human being sometimes has to go
5171,_FABLELAND._,and have strange communings with the spirits there; such is often the
5172,_FABLELAND._,movement of the Fairy Tale. But who are these spirits or weird powers
5173,_FABLELAND._,dwelling in the lone island or in the solitary wood?
5174,_FABLELAND._,
5175,_FABLELAND._,3. This question brings us to the pivotal fact of all Fableland: it is
5176,_FABLELAND._,"ruled over by a new order of deities, not Olympians; the poet, throwing"
5177,_FABLELAND._,"it out of Hellas below, throws it out of Olympus above. Indeed what"
5178,_FABLELAND._,else could he do? The Gods of Greece are the protectors of its
5179,_FABLELAND._,"institutions, State and Family; they are the embodiment of its spirit,"
5180,_FABLELAND._,of its civilization. But a spirit is now portrayed which is negative to
5181,_FABLELAND._,"Greek spirit, which denies and defies it in its very essence; the"
5182,_FABLELAND._,result is a new set of supernatural shapes which dominate the separated
5183,_FABLELAND._,"world. The negation also must be seen taking on a plastic form, and"
5184,_FABLELAND._,appearing before the Greek imagination.
5185,_FABLELAND._,
5186,_FABLELAND._,"The deities of Fableland, or its supernatural powers, are therefore"
5187,_FABLELAND._,"opposite to the deities of Olympus. Hence their shape is changed, they"
5188,_FABLELAND._,"can be even monstrosities, such as Polyphemus, the Læstrigonians,"
5189,_FABLELAND._,"Scylla and Charybdis. Circe and Calypso are beautiful women, yet not"
5190,_FABLELAND._,"natural women, in spite of their beauty; there is something superhuman"
5191,_FABLELAND._,"about them, divine, though they be not Olympians. Shapes of wonder they"
5192,_FABLELAND._,"all seem, unreal, yet in intimate connection with mankind. Moreover"
5193,_FABLELAND._,"they are local, attached to a given spot, or island; they are not"
5194,_FABLELAND._,"universal, they have no general sway like the Olympians; limited,"
5195,_FABLELAND._,"confined, particular is their authority, which the human being can and"
5196,_FABLELAND._,must transcend.
5197,_FABLELAND._,
5198,_FABLELAND._,At this point Olympus can descend into their world and give command.
5199,_FABLELAND._,"So, after all, the Greek Gods rule over the realm which is negative to"
5200,_FABLELAND._,"them, must do so, else they were not Gods. But they are in a far-off"
5201,_FABLELAND._,"background, namely, in civilized Hellas, beyond whose border Ulysses"
5202,_FABLELAND._,"passes in these Books. Still Zeus, the supreme Greek God, sends his"
5203,_FABLELAND._,"decree to Calypso, when Ulysses is ready to leave the Dark Island. Thus"
5204,_FABLELAND._,the Olympians exercise a final jurisdiction even here. It is to be
5205,_FABLELAND._,"noticed, however, that Pallas has little to do with Ulysses in"
5206,_FABLELAND._,Fableland; for is she not substantially negated? But when he touches
5207,_FABLELAND._,"Greece again, and even in Phæacia, she will not fail to be at his side."
5208,_FABLELAND._,"She belongs not to Wonderland, but to the clear rational realm of light"
5209,_FABLELAND._,and order; she cannot follow even her darling mortal through these dark
5210,_FABLELAND._,mazy wanderings.
5211,_FABLELAND._,
5212,_FABLELAND._,It is manifest that the epical Upper World of the Gods has receded from
5213,_FABLELAND._,the place it occupies in the Iliad and in the other portions of the
5214,_FABLELAND._,"Odyssey; in fact, it has been largely but not wholly supplanted. A new"
5215,_FABLELAND._,"order of deities is portrayed, subordinate, yet authoritative in their"
5216,_FABLELAND._,"limited domain, which is cut off by the vast sea from united Hellas,"
5217,_FABLELAND._,and is thus made merely individual and anti-social by its situation.
5218,_FABLELAND._,
5219,_FABLELAND._,What are these shapes and why? Man has created them that he may
5220,_FABLELAND._,indicate his own spiritual state when he has fallen out with the
5221,_FABLELAND._,established order. Really they are phases of the development of the
5222,_FABLELAND._,"hero, who is reaching out through disbelief, denial, defiance, toward a"
5223,_FABLELAND._,"restoration. He is negative to the Greek consciousness, and this"
5224,_FABLELAND._,"negation takes shape by mind, yet has to be put down by mind. The whole"
5225,_FABLELAND._,process he projects out of himself into two lines of movement: the
5226,_FABLELAND._,first is the row of preternatural forms arranged as if in a gallery of
5227,_FABLELAND._,"antique sculpture, the second is himself passing through these forms,"
5228,_FABLELAND._,"grappling with them, mastering them, or fleeing from them."
5229,_FABLELAND._,
5230,_FABLELAND._,Such is this Fairy World which has crept in under the grand Olympian
5231,_FABLELAND._,"order in response to a true necessity. Its beings are not natural, its"
5232,_FABLELAND._,events are not probable; thus the poet forces us to look inward if we
5233,_FABLELAND._,"would see his meaning. Spirit is portraying spirit, and not"
5234,_FABLELAND._,"externality, which is here made absurd; in this manner we are driven"
5235,_FABLELAND._,"out of the real into ideal, or we drop by the way in reading those four"
5236,_FABLELAND._,Books.
5237,_FABLELAND._,
5238,_FABLELAND._,4. But it must not for a moment be thought that Homer created this
5239,_FABLELAND._,"Fairy World or made, single-handed, these Fairy Tales. The latter are"
5240,_FABLELAND._,"the work of the people, possibly of the race. Comparative folk-lore has"
5241,_FABLELAND._,traced them around the globe in one form or other. The story of
5242,_FABLELAND._,Polyphemus is really a collection of stories gathered about one central
5243,_FABLELAND._,person; some portions of it have been found in the East as well as the
5244,_FABLELAND._,"West, in Arabian and Tartar legend as well as in Celtic and Esthonian."
5245,_FABLELAND._,"The subtle play upon the word ""nobody"" as a name is known far and wide"
5246,_FABLELAND._,by many people who never heard of Homer. Wilhelm Grimm took the trouble
5247,_FABLELAND._,"to collect a lot of examples from a great variety of sources, ancient,"
5248,_FABLELAND._,"medieval and modern, European and Asiatic, in a special treatise called"
5249,_FABLELAND._,"the Legend of Polyphemus. Circe, the enchantress, has been discovered"
5250,_FABLELAND._,in a Hindoo collection of Tales belonging in the main to the thirteenth
5251,_FABLELAND._,century of our era; but the witch who has the power of turning men into
5252,_FABLELAND._,animals is as universal as folk-lore itself. The werewolf superstition
5253,_FABLELAND._,will furnish instances without number. The descent into Hades has its
5254,_FABLELAND._,"parallel in the Finnish epic _Kalevala_, which reaches far back into"
5255,_FABLELAND._,Turanian legend; even the North American and Australian savages have
5256,_FABLELAND._,"their heroes enter the world beyond, and bring back an account of what"
5257,_FABLELAND._,is there. Truly one of the earliest needs of the human soul is this
5258,_FABLELAND._,striving to find and to shadow forth in mythical outlines the realm of
5259,_FABLELAND._,"the supersensible. Dante's Journey through Inferno goes back to Virgil,"
5260,_FABLELAND._,"Virgil goes back to Homer, and Homer to the folk-tales of his people,"
5261,_FABLELAND._,and these folk-tales of Greece reach out to still more remote ages and
5262,_FABLELAND._,peoples. Thus into Christian legend the old heathen stories are
5263,_FABLELAND._,"transformed; many descents to Hell and Purgatory, as well as visions of"
5264,_FABLELAND._,Heaven are recorded in the Middle Ages. It may be said that folk-tales
5265,_FABLELAND._,"have an ancestry as old as man himself, and have followed him"
5266,_FABLELAND._,"everywhere as his spirit's own shadow, which he casts as his body casts"
5267,_FABLELAND._,its visible shadow.
5268,_FABLELAND._,
5269,_FABLELAND._,"A collection of Fairy Tales we may, then, consider these four Books,"
5270,_FABLELAND._,"with its giants, cannibals, enchantresses, with its bag of winds, which"
5271,_FABLELAND._,is still furnished by the town-witch to the outgoing sailor in some
5272,_FABLELAND._,"countries, if report be true. In fact, a little delving among the"
5273,_FABLELAND._,"people, who are the great depositories of folk-lore, would probably"
5274,_FABLELAND._,"find some of the stories of the Odyssey still alive, if not in their"
5275,_FABLELAND._,"completeness, at least some shreds or floating gossamers thereof."
5276,_FABLELAND._,Indestructible is the genuine tale when once made and accepted by the
5277,_FABLELAND._,"people, being of their very essence; it is also the primordial material"
5278,_FABLELAND._,"of which all true poetry is produced, it is nature's Parian marble of"
5279,_FABLELAND._,"which the poetic temple of Greece is built, specially this Homeric"
5280,_FABLELAND._,temple.
5281,_FABLELAND._,
5282,_FABLELAND._,5. At this point we begin to see just what is the function of Homer who
5283,_FABLELAND._,"has inherited a vast mass of poetic material. He is its shaper,"
5284,_FABLELAND._,"organizer, transformer; chiefly, however, he is the architect of the"
5285,_FABLELAND._,beautiful structure of song. He does not and cannot make the stone
5286,_FABLELAND._,"which goes into his edifice, but he makes the edifice. His genius is"
5287,_FABLELAND._,architectonic; he has an idea which he builds into harmonious measures.
5288,_FABLELAND._,"What the ages have furnished, he converts to his own use, and orders"
5289,_FABLELAND._,into a poetic Whole.
5290,_FABLELAND._,
5291,_FABLELAND._,The store of Fairy Tales in those four Books was unquestionably
5292,_FABLELAND._,"transmitted to him, but he has jointed them into the Ulyssiad, and into"
5293,_FABLELAND._,"the total Odyssey, of whose structure they form the very heart. The"
5294,_FABLELAND._,question arises: Did Homer find those Tales already collected? Possibly
5295,_FABLELAND._,"he did, to a certain extent; they seem to come together of themselves,"
5296,_FABLELAND._,making a marvelous romance of the sea. Some story-telling Greek sailor
5297,_FABLELAND._,may well have given him the thread of connection; certainly they are
5298,_FABLELAND._,sprung of nautical experience. But in whatever shape they may come to
5299,_FABLELAND._,"the poet, we may be certain of one thing: his constructive spirit"
5300,_FABLELAND._,"transformed them and put them into their present place, where they fit"
5301,_FABLELAND._,"to perfection, forming a most important stage in the grand Return."
5302,_FABLELAND._,
5303,_FABLELAND._,"In the development of the folk-tale, we can in a general way mark three"
5304,_FABLELAND._,grades. (1) There is first the story which sets forth the processes in
5305,_FABLELAND._,"nature, the clouds, the winds, the storms, the sun and moon, the"
5306,_FABLELAND._,conflict of the elements. Such is mainly the mythical character of the
5307,_FABLELAND._,old Vedas. Many a trace of this ancient conception we can find in
5308,_FABLELAND._,"Homeric Fableland, which has a strong elemental substrate in the wrath"
5309,_FABLELAND._,"of Neptune, in the tempests, in the winds of Æolus, in the Oxen of the"
5310,_FABLELAND._,Sun. Still the Odyssey has passed far beyond this phase of mythical
5311,_FABLELAND._,consciousness; it cannot be explained by resolving it back into mere
5312,_FABLELAND._,"nature-myths, which method simply leaves out the vital fact, namely,"
5313,_FABLELAND._,that of development. (2) In the second stage of the Fairy Tale the
5314,_FABLELAND._,"physical meaning begins to withdraw into the background, and an ethical"
5315,_FABLELAND._,"element becomes dominant; the outer conflicts of nature, if they be"
5316,_FABLELAND._,"present, are taken to portray the spirit's struggle, in which a supreme"
5317,_FABLELAND._,moral order of some kind is brought to light. Here we may well place
5318,_FABLELAND._,Grimm's collection of folk-tales in many ways an epoch-making book. In
5319,_FABLELAND._,those simple stories of the people we observe the good and the bad
5320,_FABLELAND._,"marked off distinctly and engaged in some kind of a wrestle, which"
5321,_FABLELAND._,"shows at last the supremacy of the good. Not in every case perhaps, but"
5322,_FABLELAND._,"such is the tendency. But these Tales of Grimm, though collected, are"
5323,_FABLELAND._,"in no sense united; the architect never appeared, though they are the"
5324,_FABLELAND._,"material of a great Teutonic epos; they are the stones of the edifice,"
5325,_FABLELAND._,not the edifice itself by any means. (3) Out of this second stage
5326,_FABLELAND._,"easily rises the third, the poet being given; whereof the best example"
5327,_FABLELAND._,is just those four Books of the Odyssey. Now the folk-tale stands not
5328,_FABLELAND._,"alone, in widowed solitariness, but is made to take its place in the"
5329,_FABLELAND._,"great national, or perchance universal temple of song."
5330,_FABLELAND._,
5331,_FABLELAND._,"We may say, therefore, that Homer not only gathered these Tales but"
5332,_FABLELAND._,"organized them into a Whole, so that they no longer fall asunder into"
5333,_FABLELAND._,"separate narratives, but they are deftly interwoven and form a great"
5334,_FABLELAND._,cycle of experience. No segment of this cycle can be taken away without
5335,_FABLELAND._,breaking the totality. Moreover the entire series is but an organic
5336,_FABLELAND._,part of the Odyssey.
5337,_FABLELAND._,
5338,_FABLELAND._,It is now manifest that those who resolve these Tales into a
5339,_FABLELAND._,disconnected bead-roll have really fallen back into the second stage
5340,_FABLELAND._,before mentioned; they have undone the work of Homer. If these four
5341,_FABLELAND._,Books be simply a string of stories without an inner movement from one
5342,_FABLELAND._,"to the other, or without any organic connection with the rest of the"
5343,_FABLELAND._,"poem, the entire poetic temple is but a pile of stones and no edifice."
5344,_FABLELAND._,And this is what Wolf and his disciples make out of Homer. In one way
5345,_FABLELAND._,or other they tear asunder the structure and transform it backwards in
5346,_FABLELAND._,"a collection, allowing it hardly as much unity as may be found in the"
5347,_FABLELAND._,"Canterbury Tales of Chaucer. A school more recent than that of Wolf,"
5348,_FABLELAND._,"the Comparative Philologists, have gone still further backwards, and"
5349,_FABLELAND._,"have reduced Homer to the first stage, to a nature-myth. The merit of"
5350,_FABLELAND._,both schools is that they have called attention to Homer's primitive
5351,_FABLELAND._,materials; they have rendered impossible the idea that Homer created
5352,_FABLELAND._,"the Greek Gods or his mythology, or even his little stories. The defect"
5353,_FABLELAND._,"of these schools is that they fail to see the architectonic Homer, the"
5354,_FABLELAND._,poet who builds the crude materials furnished by his people into an
5355,_FABLELAND._,enduring structure of the noblest art. They recognize in the edifice
5356,_FABLELAND._,"the stone and also the stone-cutter, but no master-builder."
5357,_FABLELAND._,
5358,_FABLELAND._,"Homer, therefore, is not merely the editor, collector, redactor; he is"
5359,_FABLELAND._,"not a Grimm, gathering his tales from the mouths of the people with a"
5360,_FABLELAND._,"scientific accuracy. He gathered them, doubtless, but he transfigured"
5361,_FABLELAND._,them into an image reflecting the experience of a human soul. Our age
5362,_FABLELAND._,"is indeed scientific, it is collecting the folk-songs and the"
5363,_FABLELAND._,"folk-tales from every quarter of the globe, and stringing them on a"
5364,_FABLELAND._,"thread, like so many beads, not being able to transmute them into"
5365,_FABLELAND._,poetry. Wolf heralded the coming time by starting to reconvert Homer
5366,_FABLELAND._,"into his primitive materials, by making him scientific and not poetic,"
5367,_FABLELAND._,at least not architectonic. Still we may be permitted to hope that
5368,_FABLELAND._,these vast collections of the world's folk-lore will yet be transmuted
5369,_FABLELAND._,by some new Homer into a world-poem.
5370,_FABLELAND._,
5371,_FABLELAND._,6. The careful reader will also weigh the fact that Ulysses is now the
5372,_FABLELAND._,story-teller himself. The entire series of adventures in Fableland is
5373,_FABLELAND._,"put into his mouth by the poet. Herein, we note a striking difference"
5374,_FABLELAND._,"from the previous Book, the ninth, in which Demodocus is the singer."
5375,_FABLELAND._,What is the ground of such a marked transition? Demodocus has as his
5376,_FABLELAND._,"theme the war at Troy with its lays of heroes, and its famous deeds; he"
5377,_FABLELAND._,celebrates the period portrayed in the Iliad; his field is the Heroic
5378,_FABLELAND._,"Epos, or the songs of which it is composed. But he cannot sing of the"
5379,_FABLELAND._,"world outside of the Greco-Trojan consciousness, he cannot reach beyond"
5380,_FABLELAND._,"the Olympian order into the new set of deities of Fableland. Ulysses,"
5381,_FABLELAND._,"however, has transcended the Trojan epoch, has, in fact, reacted"
5382,_FABLELAND._,"against Hellenic life and institutions, though he longs to get back to"
5383,_FABLELAND._,"them, out of his alienated condition. This internal phase Demodocus"
5384,_FABLELAND._,"does not know, it manifestly lies beyond his art. He does not sing of"
5385,_FABLELAND._,"the Return at all, though Phemius, the Ithacan bard, did in the First"
5386,_FABLELAND._,"Book. A new strain is this, requiring a new singer, namely the man who"
5387,_FABLELAND._,has had the wonderful experience himself.
5388,_FABLELAND._,
5389,_FABLELAND._,"The result is, another art-form has to be employed, the Fairy Tale, of"
5390,_FABLELAND._,which we have already spoken. The individual now turns inward and
5391,_FABLELAND._,"narrates his marvelous adventures in the region of spirit, his"
5392,_FABLELAND._,"wrestlings there, his doubts, his defeats and escapes. For Fableland is"
5393,_FABLELAND._,"not actual like Hellas, not even like Phæacia; it is a creation of the"
5394,_FABLELAND._,"mind in order to express mind, and its shapes have to be removed from"
5395,_FABLELAND._,sensuous reality to fulfill the law of their being. Such is plainly
5396,_FABLELAND._,"Homer's procedure. Once before he sped off into Fairyland, toward Egypt"
5397,_FABLELAND._,"and the East, leaving Hellas and Troy behind, quite as Ulysses here"
5398,_FABLELAND._,"does. It was the story of Menelaus in the Fourth Book, who also found"
5399,_FABLELAND._,"Proteus and Eidothea, a new order of deities, though Olympus and Zeus"
5400,_FABLELAND._,"lay in the distant background. Moreover, Proteus and Eidothea represent"
5401,_FABLELAND._,"the two sides, the supersensible and the sensible, the latter of which"
5402,_FABLELAND._,"must be transcended and the former grasped, ere return be possible."
5403,_FABLELAND._,
5404,_FABLELAND._,"Nestor also tells his own experience in the Third Book, but he keeps"
5405,_FABLELAND._,inside of Hellas and under the direct control of the Greek Gods. Hence
5406,_FABLELAND._,"no Faery Realm rises in his narrative, he needs none for"
5407,_FABLELAND._,"self-expression. But Menelaus and Ulysses, wandering far over the Greek"
5408,_FABLELAND._,"border, reach a new world, and require a new art-form for their"
5409,_FABLELAND._,"adequate utterance. Especially is this the case with Ulysses, who has"
5410,_FABLELAND._,"had a much larger and deeper experience than Menelaus, and who thus"
5411,_FABLELAND._,"stands in strong contrast with Nestor, the old man of faith with his"
5412,_FABLELAND._,"devotion to the old order, who has no devious return from Troy, and"
5413,_FABLELAND._,continues to live in immediate unquestioning harmony with the
5414,_FABLELAND._,Olympians. There is no room in Pylos for a Circe or a Polyphemus.
5415,_FABLELAND._,
5416,_FABLELAND._,"Ulysses, therefore, having reached the court of Phæacia, takes a calm"
5417,_FABLELAND._,"retrospect of the past, and recounts the same to the people there; he"
5418,_FABLELAND._,"comes to know himself, and he uses art for self-expression, not for the"
5419,_FABLELAND._,praise of the external deed of war; his inner life is the theme. In
5420,_FABLELAND._,"other words, he has become self-conscious in Phæacia, he knows his own"
5421,_FABLELAND._,"processes, and shows that he knows them. As already pointed out, this"
5422,_FABLELAND._,"internal movement of his spirit is the process of the negative, he has"
5423,_FABLELAND._,"turned denier of the old institutional order of Greece, and he has to"
5424,_FABLELAND._,"work through into a positive world again, which he now sees before"
5425,_FABLELAND._,himself in Phæacia.
5426,_FABLELAND._,
5427,_FABLELAND._,"To be sure, the self-consciousness to which he has attained is not"
5428,_FABLELAND._,"expressed in the language of philosophy, but in poetry, in a"
5429,_FABLELAND._,transcendental Fairyland. There is as yet no Greek language of
5430,_FABLELAND._,philosophy; a long development will bring it forth however; Aristotle
5431,_FABLELAND._,"will deracinate the last image of Homer, and leave the Greek tongue"
5432,_FABLELAND._,supersensible.
5433,_FABLELAND._,
5434,_FABLELAND._,7. The fact that Ulysses must tell his own story is deeply coupled with
5435,_FABLELAND._,the following characteristic: these four Books of Fableland are
5436,_FABLELAND._,essentially a confession. From beginning to end we observe it to be an
5437,_FABLELAND._,account of shortcomings and their results; we find the acknowledgment
5438,_FABLELAND._,of error in the very statement of the transaction. He confesses to
5439,_FABLELAND._,Alcinous and the Phæacians his negative attitude to the State and the
5440,_FABLELAND._,consequences thereof; he confesses to Arete in what way he has violated
5441,_FABLELAND._,her institution. Here lies the necessity: this confession is absolutely
5442,_FABLELAND._,needful to his soul to free it of its negative past. He has become
5443,_FABLELAND._,"conscious of his condition, and utters his confession to these people"
5444,_FABLELAND._,"who are the opposite of it, and thus gets rid of his limitation. The"
5445,_FABLELAND._,psychologic ground of his telling his own story is that he must.
5446,_FABLELAND._,
5447,_FABLELAND._,"To be sure, this is all done in a mythical form, which is somewhat"
5448,_FABLELAND._,alien to our method of making a confession. Then Homer does not
5449,_FABLELAND._,"moralize by the way, he does not usually approve or condemn; he simply"
5450,_FABLELAND._,"states the deed and its consequences. His procedure is objective, truly"
5451,_FABLELAND._,"artistic, letting the thing speak for itself. The modern reader,"
5452,_FABLELAND._,"however, likes to have moral observations interspersed, which will stir"
5453,_FABLELAND._,"up his sentiments, and save him the trouble of thinking the matter out"
5454,_FABLELAND._,for himself.
5455,_FABLELAND._,
5456,_FABLELAND._,"Yet Ulysses, on the other hand, is always striving to reach out of his"
5457,_FABLELAND._,"error, to transcend his limitation. His mistake flings him to the"
5458,_FABLELAND._,"earth, but he gets up again and marches forward. Thus he asserts his"
5459,_FABLELAND._,own infinite worth; he is certain to reach home at last and accomplish
5460,_FABLELAND._,the grand Return.
5461,_FABLELAND._,
5462,_FABLELAND._,But he does not bring back his companions. These often seem to be lower
5463,_FABLELAND._,"unheroic phases of human nature, which the hero must throw off in the"
5464,_FABLELAND._,"course of his development. In general, they may be considered to be in"
5465,_FABLELAND._,"him, a part of himself, yet they are real persons too. This rule,"
5466,_FABLELAND._,"however, will not always apply. Still his companions are lost, having"
5467,_FABLELAND._,"""perished by their own folly,"" while he is saved; the wise man is to"
5468,_FABLELAND._,"live, the unwise to pass away."
5469,_FABLELAND._,
5470,_FABLELAND._,"The pivotal sin committed by Ulysses in Fableland is against Neptune,"
5471,_FABLELAND._,who is angry because Ulysses put out the eye of his son Polyphemus. So
5472,_FABLELAND._,"the God, after the affair of the Oxen of the Sun, becomes the grand"
5473,_FABLELAND._,"obstacle to the Return, and helps to keep the hero with Calypso. Such"
5474,_FABLELAND._,is the mythical statement in which three conceptions seem to blend. (1)
5475,_FABLELAND._,"Neptune is the purely physical obstacle of the sea, very great in those"
5476,_FABLELAND._,"early days. (2) Nature has her law, and if it be not observed, the"
5477,_FABLELAND._,"penalty follows, when she may be said to be mythically angry. If a man"
5478,_FABLELAND._,"jump down from a high precipice, he violates a law of nature,"
5479,_FABLELAND._,"gravitation, and she executes him on the spot, it may be; she is always"
5480,_FABLELAND._,angry and quick to punish in such cases; but he may climb down the
5481,_FABLELAND._,"height and escape. In like manner a man, undertaking to swim across the"
5482,_FABLELAND._,"sea, encounters the wrath of Neptune; but he may construct a ship, and"
5483,_FABLELAND._,make the voyage. (3) Finally there is the ethical violation: we shall
5484,_FABLELAND._,"see in the narrative, how Ulysses, after appealing to humanity, becomes"
5485,_FABLELAND._,"himself inhuman and a savage toward Polyphemus, who then curses him and"
5486,_FABLELAND._,invokes father Neptune with effect. So the God visits upon Ulysses the
5487,_FABLELAND._,"punishment for his ethical offense, which is the main one after all. In"
5488,_FABLELAND._,this way Fableland through the story of Polyphemus contains a leading
5489,_FABLELAND._,"motive of the Ulyssiad, and thereby of the whole Odyssey, and Ulysses"
5490,_FABLELAND._,is seen to be detained really by his own deed.
5491,_FABLELAND._,
5492,_FABLELAND._,8. The general structure of these four Books is simple enough. They
5493,_FABLELAND._,"form a series of adventures, with three to a Book. Though the"
5494,_FABLELAND._,"connection seems slight on the surface, there are inner threads which"
5495,_FABLELAND._,bind intimately together the separate adventures; one of the points in
5496,_FABLELAND._,any true interpretation is to raise these threads to light. The general
5497,_FABLELAND._,movement of the whole may be regarded as threefold: the sensible world
5498,_FABLELAND._,"(two Books), the supersensible Hades (one Book), the sensible world a"
5499,_FABLELAND._,"second time (one Book). Very significant are these changes, but it is"
5500,_FABLELAND._,hardly worth while to forecast them here; they must be studied in
5501,_FABLELAND._,"detail first, then a retrospect can be given, as the contents of the"
5502,_FABLELAND._,"four Books will be present in the reader's mind. We may now say,"
5503,_FABLELAND._,"however, that this sweep from the sensible into the supersensible, and"
5504,_FABLELAND._,"back again to the sensible, has in it the meaning of a soul's"
5505,_FABLELAND._,"experience, and that the second sensible realm here mentioned is very"
5506,_FABLELAND._,different from the first.
5507,_FABLELAND._,
5508,_FABLELAND._,"The central fact of Fableland is, accordingly, that the man must get"
5509,_FABLELAND._,"beyond the realm of the senses, and hold communion with pure spirit,"
5510,_FABLELAND._,"with the prophet Tiresias, and then come back to the real world,"
5511,_FABLELAND._,"bringing the wisdom gained beyond, ere he can complete the cycle of the"
5512,_FABLELAND._,grand Return.
5513,_FABLELAND._,
5514,_FABLELAND._,
5515,_FABLELAND._,
5516,_FABLELAND._,
5517,_BOOK NINTH._,_BOOK NINTH._
5518,_BOOK NINTH._,
5519,_BOOK NINTH._,
5520,_BOOK NINTH._,"Ulysses is now called for by Alcinous, and he is to be the singer. At"
5521,_BOOK NINTH._,"first he naturally pays a compliment to his predecessor Demodocus: ""A"
5522,_BOOK NINTH._,"pleasant thing to hear a bard such as this,"" with a voice like unto"
5523,_BOOK NINTH._,that of the Gods. Then he gives a delicate touch of commendation to the
5524,_BOOK NINTH._,"whole people ""sitting in a row and listening to the singer"" who is"
5525,_BOOK NINTH._,chanting the famous deeds of the aforetime. But when Ulysses praises
5526,_BOOK NINTH._,"the tables laden with bread and meat, and the cupbearer filling the"
5527,_BOOK NINTH._,"wine-cups of the guests, saying, ""This seems to me the best thing,"""
5528,_BOOK NINTH._,"strong opposition has been aroused, shown even in antiquity by the"
5529,_BOOK NINTH._,sharp protest of Plato and Lucian. Still this Phæacian enjoyment is
5530,_BOOK NINTH._,"innocent enough; not ascetic is the trait, yet not sensual; to-day good"
5531,_BOOK NINTH._,people usually eat and drink without the song of bard or other
5532,_BOOK NINTH._,spiritual entertainment accompanying the material one of gustation.
5533,_BOOK NINTH._,
5534,_BOOK NINTH._,"Now comes the change, Ulysses is to give a song, he is to sing his own"
5535,_BOOK NINTH._,"deeds, the story of his trials, ""which will wake fresh sorrow in me."""
5536,_BOOK NINTH._,Clearly this will be a different song from the preceding one of
5537,_BOOK NINTH._,"Demodocus; not now an heroic tale of Troy, but an account of the Return"
5538,_BOOK NINTH._,therefrom; a tale in which endurance is the theme rather than action.
5539,_BOOK NINTH._,The hero is more the sufferer than the doer; he is to meet the hostile
5540,_BOOK NINTH._,blows of Fate and to master it by his ability to bear as well as by his
5541,_BOOK NINTH._,ability to act. A new poetic form will gradually rise out of the theme
5542,_BOOK NINTH._,and in harmony with the same; the present movement runs counter to the
5543,_BOOK NINTH._,Trojan story both in space and in spirit.
5544,_BOOK NINTH._,
5545,_BOOK NINTH._,The first act of Ulysses in this novel procedure is to be duly noted:
5546,_BOOK NINTH._,"he declares who he is, gives his father's name and utters a hint of his"
5547,_BOOK NINTH._,own character. Very great surprise must the announcement have created
5548,_BOOK NINTH._,"among those Phæacians--a veritable sensation, as we say in these times;"
5549,_BOOK NINTH._,for Ulysses had been the real hero of the songs of Demodocus just sung;
5550,_BOOK NINTH._,"behold, that hero himself is present and has been listening all the"
5551,_BOOK NINTH._,"while. The dramatic disguise, in which the interest of the hearer has"
5552,_BOOK NINTH._,"centered hitherto, is thrown off, the concealed man shows himself."
5553,_BOOK NINTH._,
5554,_BOOK NINTH._,"Still deeper must we look into this act of self-revelation. ""I am"
5555,_BOOK NINTH._,"Ulysses,"" says the bard now, proposing to sing of Ulysses. I am myself,"
5556,_BOOK NINTH._,I know what I have done and I am the man to tell it. Really here is a
5557,_BOOK NINTH._,statement of self-consciousness; the singer is no longer a Demodocus
5558,_BOOK NINTH._,"singing of another man, of Ulysses, at Troy, but it is Ulysses himself,"
5559,_BOOK NINTH._,"now singing of himself, of his profoundest experiences, which none"
5560,_BOOK NINTH._,"other but he can tell. His internal life opens, not that active heroic"
5561,_BOOK NINTH._,"one; the trials of his spirit are the theme, therewith must follow a"
5562,_BOOK NINTH._,"new manner of utterance, a poetic form which can express what is within"
5563,_BOOK NINTH._,and still remain in the domain of the imagination. A self-conscious art
5564,_BOOK NINTH._,"we must now be prepared for, which seeks to express just the"
5565,_BOOK NINTH._,"self-consciousness of the poet going through his inner experiences,"
5566,_BOOK NINTH._,with the counterstroke from the outer world.
5567,_BOOK NINTH._,
5568,_BOOK NINTH._,"What new art-form, then, will Homer, the grand constructive poet, who"
5569,_BOOK NINTH._,"seizes every object necessary for his temple of song, assign to Ulysses"
5570,_BOOK NINTH._,singing of himself? The Fairy Tale is taken with its strange
5571,_BOOK NINTH._,"supernatural shapes, which have no reality, and hence can only have an"
5572,_BOOK NINTH._,ideal meaning; we are ushered into the realm of the physically
5573,_BOOK NINTH._,"impossible, where we have to see the spiritually actual, if we see"
5574,_BOOK NINTH._,"anything. Polyphemus is not a man, not an animal, not a direct product"
5575,_BOOK NINTH._,of nature; he is a creature of the mind made by the mind in order to
5576,_BOOK NINTH._,"express mind. Undoubtedly he has external shape, but that shape is"
5577,_BOOK NINTH._,meaningless till we catch the spirit creating him. The Fairy Tale
5578,_BOOK NINTH._,"removes the vision from an outer sensuous world, and compels an"
5579,_BOOK NINTH._,"internal vision, which looks into the soul of things and there beholds"
5580,_BOOK NINTH._,the soul.
5581,_BOOK NINTH._,
5582,_BOOK NINTH._,"The Fairy Tale existed long before Homer, it is a genuine product of"
5583,_BOOK NINTH._,the people. The stories which here follow have been traced among the
5584,_BOOK NINTH._,remotest races; they spring up of themselves out of the popular heart
5585,_BOOK NINTH._,and imagination. Homer picks them up and puts them into their true
5586,_BOOK NINTH._,"place in his grand edifice, polishing, transforming them, by no means"
5587,_BOOK NINTH._,creating them; certainly he never created this art-form. His merit is
5588,_BOOK NINTH._,that he saw where they belong and what phase of human experience they
5589,_BOOK NINTH._,"express; to this merit must be added his special power, that of poetic"
5590,_BOOK NINTH._,transfiguration. Not simply a redactor or putter together externally of
5591,_BOOK NINTH._,"odd scraps, but the true architect of the totality; thus he comes"
5592,_BOOK NINTH._,before us on the present and on all other occasions.
5593,_BOOK NINTH._,
5594,_BOOK NINTH._,"Ulysses, having told us who he is, proceeds to inform us of a second"
5595,_BOOK NINTH._,important fact: his soul's strongest aspiration. He longs to return to
5596,_BOOK NINTH._,"home and country. Ithaca, a small, rocky island, is the sweetest spot"
5597,_BOOK NINTH._,"on earth to him; Circe and then Calypso tried to detain him, each"
5598,_BOOK NINTH._,"wishing to keep him as husband; ""but they could not shake the purpose"
5599,_BOOK NINTH._,"of my heart."" One thinks that he must, while saying this, have cast a"
5600,_BOOK NINTH._,"sly glance at Arete, for whose approval it must have been intended, for"
5601,_BOOK NINTH._,she was no friend of Circe and Calypso.
5602,_BOOK NINTH._,
5603,_BOOK NINTH._,"It is a curious fact that Homer, in this short description, makes two"
5604,_BOOK NINTH._,mistakes in reference to the topography of Ithaca. The island can
5605,_BOOK NINTH._,"hardly be called low as here stated, nor does it lie westward of"
5606,_BOOK NINTH._,"Cephallenia, but northeastward. A reasonable inference is that Homer"
5607,_BOOK NINTH._,"was not an Ithacan, and did not know the island very well, though he"
5608,_BOOK NINTH._,may have seen it in a passing visit. Anaximander with his first map
5609,_BOOK NINTH._,comes after Homer several hundred years.
5610,_BOOK NINTH._,
5611,_BOOK NINTH._,The present Book has three plainly marked portions. First comes the
5612,_BOOK NINTH._,"wanton attack on the Ciconians, which connects immediately with the"
5613,_BOOK NINTH._,Trojan experience of Ulysses. Second is the country of the
5614,_BOOK NINTH._,"Lotus-eaters, to which he and his companions are driven by wind and"
5615,_BOOK NINTH._,"storm. Third is the Land of the Cyclops, especially of Polyphemus, with"
5616,_BOOK NINTH._,whom he has his chief adventures. The first two portions are quite
5617,_BOOK NINTH._,"brief, are in fact introductory to the third, which takes up more than"
5618,_BOOK NINTH._,"four-fifths of the Book, and is the Fairy Tale proper. We may observe"
5619,_BOOK NINTH._,the gradual transition: the Ciconians are a real people in geography
5620,_BOOK NINTH._,"and history; the Lotus-eaters are getting mythical, are but half-way"
5621,_BOOK NINTH._,historical; the Cyclops belong wholly to Fableland. Thus there is a
5622,_BOOK NINTH._,movement out of the Trojan background of reality into the Fairy World.
5623,_BOOK NINTH._,
5624,_BOOK NINTH._,"Having marked the dividing lines, the next thing will be to find the"
5625,_BOOK NINTH._,connecting links between these three portions. They are not thrown
5626,_BOOK NINTH._,together haphazard or externally joined into one Book; they have an
5627,_BOOK NINTH._,internal thought which unifies them and which must be brought to light.
5628,_BOOK NINTH._,"The poet sees in images which are separate, but the thinker must unite"
5629,_BOOK NINTH._,"these images by their inner necessity, and thus justify anew the poet."
5630,_BOOK NINTH._,
5631,_BOOK NINTH._,
5632,I.,I.
5633,I.,
5634,I.,"The first sentence strikes the leading thought: ""The wind, bearing me"
5635,I.,"from Troy, brought me to the Ciconians."" Troy is the starting-point,"
5636,I.,the background out of which everything moves. After the fall of the
5637,I.,city Nestor gives an account of the disputes of the Greek leaders and
5638,I.,their separation (Book III. l. 134 et seq.); Ulysses is driven alone
5639,I.,"with his contingent across the sea toward Thrace, where he finds a city"
5640,I.,"in peace, though it had been an ally of Troy. ""I sacked the city, I"
5641,I.,"destroyed its people;"" he treated them as he did the Trojans, ""taking"
5642,I.,"as booty their wives and property."" Such is the spirit begotten of that"
5643,I.,"ten years' war in the character of Ulysses, a spirit of violence and"
5644,I.,"rapine, totally unfitted for a civilized life, at bottom negative to"
5645,I.,Family and State. This is the spiritual starting-point from which he is
5646,I.,"to return to home and country through a long, long, but very needful"
5647,I.,discipline.
5648,I.,
5649,I.,He is well aware that he has done something for which vengeance awaits
5650,I.,"him, so he urges his companions to flee at once. But they would not"
5651,I.,"obey, they stayed there ""drinking much wine and slaughtering sheep and"
5652,I.,"oxen along the sea-shore."" Revel and feasting follow, till the"
5653,I.,Ciconians rouse the outlying neighbors and drive the Greeks to the
5654,I.,"ships, with the loss of six companions for each ship. Such is the first"
5655,I.,"incident after the Trojan War, showing clearly the destructive phase"
5656,I.,"thereof, which has been drilled into the character by so long a period"
5657,I.,of bloodshed.
5658,I.,
5659,I.,"This is not yet Fairyland, but a real people and a real conflict. The"
5660,I.,Ciconians in the later historic time of Herodotus still dwelt in
5661,I.,Thrace. Grotius in his famous book _On the Rights of Peace and War_
5662,I.,cites the present instance as a violation of international justice. The
5663,I.,grand positive ground of attacking Troy is not found here; there was no
5664,I.,Helen detained in wrongful captivity. The sack of Ismarus pictures the
5665,I.,"evil results which spring from all war, even the most just. Again we"
5666,I.,must affirm that this deed of wrongful violence is the start toward the
5667,I.,"great Return, and hints what has to be overcome internally by the"
5668,I.,journey through Fairyland.
5669,I.,
5670,I.,"Later we find a fact, not here mentioned, pertaining to the sack of the"
5671,I.,"city of the Ciconians. Ulysses had saved Maron, the priest of Apollo,"
5672,I.,who in gratitude gave him the strong wine with which he overcame
5673,I.,Polyphemus in the cave. His merciful deed thus helped him conquer the
5674,I.,"monster of nature. But in general it is plain that Ulysses, though"
5675,I.,"desiring to get back to an institutional life, is not ready by any"
5676,I.,means for such a step; he is in reality hostile to the very essence of
5677,I.,institutional life. He is too much like the suitors now to be their
5678,I.,punisher.
5679,I.,
5680,I.,"All put to sea again, to be tossed on that unruly element, with their"
5681,I.,"little vessels exposed to wind and wave. ""They call thrice by name each"
5682,I.,"one of their dead companions"" ere they set out; the meaning of this"
5683,I.,"invocation has been much discussed, but it probably rests upon the"
5684,I.,belief that they could thus call the souls of the deceased to go along
5685,I.,with them to home and country. The fact that just six were lost from
5686,I.,each ship was made the ground of an assault upon Homer in antiquity by
5687,I.,"Zoilus, famed as the Homeromastix, or Homer's trouncer."
5688,I.,
5689,I.,"The great sea with its tempests is now before them, heaving and"
5690,I.,tossing; after the attack upon the Ciconians we can well imagine that
5691,I.,this storm has its inner counterpart in the soul of Ulysses. Does he
5692,I.,not show within himself a deep scission--between his desire to return
5693,I.,and his deed? At any rate he is borne forward; when he sought to round
5694,I.,"Maleia, the southern point of Greece (now Cape St. Angelo), and sail"
5695,I.,"home to Ithaca, he was carried out to sea by the winds, beyond the"
5696,I.,"Island Cythera, across the main toward the coast of Africa. Thus he is"
5697,I.,swept outside the boundaries of Hellas proper into a region dimly
5698,I.,"known, half-mythical; he cannot make the sharp turn at Maleia, inside"
5699,I.,the Greek world; he must go beyond it and there reach his final
5700,I.,"experience. Not simply physical is this description, else it would be a"
5701,I.,mere statement in geography; it is also spiritual and hence rises into
5702,I.,poetry.
5703,I.,
5704,I.,
5705,II.,II.
5706,II.,
5707,II.,"Next is the land of the Lotus-eaters, where Ulysses and his companions"
5708,II.,"arrive, after being driven helplessly ""across the fishy deep"" for nine"
5709,II.,days (this is a favorite number in Homer) by the hostile winds. The
5710,II.,"Lotus-eaters, ""whose food is flowers"" use no violence, but reach to the"
5711,II.,"new-comers their plant, the lotus, to satisfy hunger. Whoever has once"
5712,II.,"tasted of that pleasant food, straightway forgets home and the Return,"
5713,II.,"and wishes to live always among the Lotus-eaters. The will is broken,"
5714,II.,"all activity is sapped; the land of idlers it is, relaxed in a sensuous"
5715,II.,"dream life, in which there is a complete collapse of volition."
5716,II.,
5717,II.,"Now the point is to connect this country with the Ciconians, or rather"
5718,II.,to see this internal condition evolving itself out of the preceding
5719,II.,"one. For the line of conjunction must be within, of the spirit;"
5720,II.,"physically the two countries are far enough apart. In the first case,"
5721,II.,"we have noted a state of external violence, which really means a"
5722,II.,"destroying of the will. The Greeks assailed a quiet people, assailed"
5723,II.,"its will; then they were beaten and driven off, they had their negative"
5724,II.,deed served up to themselves. Now what? There follows an internal
5725,II.,"collapse of the will, a logical result of their own conduct, which is"
5726,II.,"hinted by their being drifted about on the seas, apparently quite"
5727,II.,"helpless. No wonder that, when they touched land again, and obtained"
5728,II.,"some food, they desired to stay there, and eat of the lotus. Yet it is"
5729,II.,the consequence of their own act; that wanton destruction of the
5730,II.,Ciconian will is at bottom the destruction of their own will; they are
5731,II.,really assailing their own principle--a fact which is to be brought
5732,II.,home to them by a long and bitter experience.
5733,II.,
5734,II.,"But there is one man among them, who, though not guiltless by any"
5735,II.,"means, felt the nature of the Ciconian act, and who has still some"
5736,II.,"volition left in the right direction. ""By force I led back to the ship"
5737,II.,"those who had tasted of the lotus, and bound them beneath the"
5738,II.,"oar-benches."" The rest of the companions were ordered aboard, they"
5739,II.,obeyed; off they sail again on the hoary deep--whitherward? Thus
5740,II.,"Ulysses shows himself the man of will among the will-less, and solves"
5741,II.,"his part of the problem among the Lotus-eaters, setting out for the new"
5742,II.,Unknown.
5743,II.,
5744,II.,This people probably lived on the coast of Lybia according to Homer's
5745,II.,"conception, though the land is outside the clear Greek geographical"
5746,II.,"horizon, floating mistily somewhere on its borders, half real, half"
5747,II.,"fabulous, on the way to Fairyland. We enter more distinctly the inner"
5748,II.,"realm of the spirit, as the outer realm of reality becomes less"
5749,II.,"distinct and demonstrable. The Ciconians were an actual people, the"
5750,II.,"conflict with them also actual, quite the Trojan conflict; but the"
5751,II.,Lotus-eaters form the transition to the Wonderland of the Odyssey.
5752,II.,
5753,II.,"As regards the lotus, several plants were called by that name; one is"
5754,II.,mentioned in a previous Book of the Odyssey (IV. 603) which was
5755,II.,probably a kind of clover growing in the damp lowlands of Greece and
5756,II.,"Asia Minor, and utilized for grazing. Another sort was a species of"
5757,II.,lily which grew in the valley of the Nile. But the lotus of the present
5758,II.,passage is generally considered to be the fruit of a shrub which yields
5759,II.,"a reddish berry of the size of a common olive, having somewhat the"
5760,II.,"taste of a fig. This fruit is still highly esteemed in Tripolis, Tunis"
5761,II.,"and Algiers; from the last named country it has passed over to France,"
5762,II.,and is often hawked about the streets of Paris under the name of
5763,II.,"_Jujube_, where the passing traveler will purchase a sample, and eat of"
5764,II.,"the same, testing the truth of Homer's description, but probably not"
5765,II.,losing thereby his desire for home and country.
5766,II.,
5767,II.,The Lotus-eaters have had a famous history; they have caught the fancy
5768,II.,of poets and literary men who have sought in various ways to reproduce
5769,II.,and embellish them. Among English-speaking peoples the poem of Tennyson
5770,II.,on this subject is a prime favorite. But in Homer the Lotus-eaters are
5771,II.,"not an isolated fact, they are a link in the chain of a grand"
5772,II.,development; this inner connecting thought is the true thing to grasp.
5773,II.,
5774,II.,"Let us, then, penetrate the heart of the next movement of Ulysses. The"
5775,II.,"Lotus-eater gave up family and country; ""chewing the lotus, he forgot"
5776,II.,"the return."" His will vanished into a sensuous oblivion; he was"
5777,II.,"indifferent, and this indifference was a passive destruction of the"
5778,II.,Greek world to which he was returning. But now in due order the active
5779,II.,"destroyer of that world appears; behold the Cyclops, the wild man of"
5780,II.,"nature, truly a monster to the Greek institutional sense, being without"
5781,II.,domestic and civil order. Thus we mark the inner transition: the active
5782,II.,"principle of that which was a passive Lotus-eater is the Cyclops, a"
5783,II.,"Polyphemus. The Trojan negative result, so deeply lodged in the soul of"
5784,II.,"Ulysses and his companions, cannot remain mere indifference or"
5785,II.,"forgetfulness; it must proceed to action, to virulent destructive"
5786,II.,"action, which is now to be bodied forth in a fabulous shape. Only a few"
5787,II.,"of the weakest companions of Ulysses were ready to become Lotus-eaters,"
5788,II.,and they were easily thrust under the oar-benches and carried away.
5789,II.,"Here there is a fresh conflict, altogether the main one of the present"
5790,II.,Book.
5791,II.,
5792,II.,
5793,III.,III.
5794,III.,
5795,III.,"If then we have seized the matter aright, we have reached a shape in"
5796,III.,"Fairyland, which represents what is hostile, actively hostile, to the"
5797,III.,"Greek institutional world, State, Family, Society. Ulysses stands in a"
5798,III.,double relation to the present condition of things. The Cyclops is
5799,III.,"really a picture of him in his negative character, a product of his"
5800,III.,"destructive Trojan spirit, yet he is just the man who must put down the"
5801,III.,"Cyclops, he must master his own negation or perish. Ulysses sees the"
5802,III.,"natural man, or rather, he sees himself with all culture taken away,"
5803,III.,with all institutional life eliminated from his existence.
5804,III.,
5805,III.,"He may well be frightened at the monster, who is very real, though a"
5806,III.,dweller in Fairyland. Nor should we forget that the Cyclops also
5807,III.,"undergoes a change, he too is in the process and shows something like"
5808,III.,development under the severe tuition of Ulysses.
5809,III.,
5810,III.,"As already said, the present portion is altogether the longest in the"
5811,III.,"Book, it is essentially the entire Book. The other two portions were"
5812,III.,hardly more than a short introduction and a brief transitional stage;
5813,III.,"now comes the full and highly elaborated tale, in which both the land"
5814,III.,"and its inhabitants are fabulous, supernatural. There are two distinct"
5815,III.,divisions treating of the Cyclops: the first describes their race in
5816,III.,"general, the second gives a description of the particular grand"
5817,III.,"Cyclops, Polyphemus, in his conflict with Ulysses."
5818,III.,
5819,III.,"I. This time there is no tempest, such as arose after leaving the"
5820,III.,"Ciconians, in order to reach the land of the Cyclops; that collapse of"
5821,III.,the will seems to have pictured itself in the quiet deep. But who are
5822,III.,"the Cyclops? A race ""without law, addicted to violent deeds;"" they have"
5823,III.,"no agriculture, ""they plant not, neither do they plow;"" they get their"
5824,III.,"products, ""trusting to the Gods,"" that is, trusting to nature, since"
5825,III.,"the Cyclops have small regard for the higher Gods, as we shall soon"
5826,III.,"see. Another mere formula this, showing that the Homeric deity was"
5827,III.,"getting crystallized even for Homer. ""They hold no councils"" in common,"
5828,III.,"are not associated together, but ""they dwell in vaulted caves on"
5829,III.,"mountain heights,"" such as the famous Corycian cavern which is near the"
5830,III.,"top of a mountain on Parnassus. There ""each man rules his wives and"
5831,III.,"children,"" evidently a herding polygamous condition of the family; ""nor"
5832,III.,"do they (the Cyclops) care for one another."" Still further, ""they have"
5833,III.,"no ships with crimson prows,"" no navigation, no commerce which seeks"
5834,III.,"""the cities of men"" and binds them together in the bond of society and"
5835,III.,"humanity. Yet there is an excellent harbor and a good soil, ""with"
5836,III.,"copious showers from Zeus;"" nature has surely done her part, and is"
5837,III.,calling loudly for the enterprising colonist to come and plant here his
5838,III.,civilized order. This passage must have stirred the Greek emigrant to
5839,III.,"leave his stony Hellas and seek in the West, a new home; it suggests"
5840,III.,the great Hellenic movement for the colonization of Italy and Sicily
5841,III.,from the 6th to the 9th century B.C. The poet has plainly been with
5842,III.,"the frontiersman, and seen the latter's giants."
5843,III.,
5844,III.,The main thing to be noticed in the present account is the
5845,III.,"extraordinary number of negatives. No laws, no assemblies, no"
5846,III.,"association; no plows, no ships, no intercourse with other cities; the"
5847,III.,"whole civilized life of man is negated, and man himself is thrown back"
5848,III.,into a state of nature. It is worth while to search for the purpose of
5849,III.,this negative procedure on the part of the poet. He might have given a
5850,III.,"positive description of nature, telling what it is, and telling what"
5851,III.,"the Cyclops is, not emphasizing so much what he is not. But thus the"
5852,III.,meaning would not come out so plainly; the Cyclops is just the negation
5853,III.,"of the whole civilized world of Greece, which fact must be expressly"
5854,III.,imaged in the very words used in the poem. He is not so much a simple
5855,III.,being of nature as a being antithetic to society.
5856,III.,
5857,III.,At this point we can trace his connection with the great Trojan
5858,III.,"experience, which, as already set forth, has begotten a negative"
5859,III.,"tendency in its participators. The war at Troy, like all war"
5860,III.,"long-continued, has bred men to be anti-social; they have to destroy"
5861,III.,"State, Family, Commerce, Agriculture, till destruction becomes habit,"
5862,III.,"yea principle, and takes possession of their intellect. The Cyclops was"
5863,III.,"generated at Ilium, and is a colossal phantasm of the spirit which"
5864,III.,prompted the attack on the Ciconians.
5865,III.,
5866,III.,It should be stated here that the Cyclops of Homer are different from
5867,III.,"those of Hesiod and of other mythographers, inasmuch as the latter were"
5868,III.,"represented as the demons who forged the thunderbolts of Zeus, and were"
5869,III.,connected with the volcanic agencies chiefly in Sicily and Italy. Mount
5870,III.,Ætna belching forth its lava streams may have suggested to the Greek
5871,III.,"imagination the sick giant Polyphemus in its caverns, drunk on the red"
5872,III.,destructive wine of Ulysses.
5873,III.,
5874,III.,"First is a small island, ""stretching outside the harbor"" of the land of"
5875,III.,"the Cyclops, woody, full of wild goats; there the ships of Ulysses drew"
5876,III.,"to the shore. It was bare of human dwellers, the Cyclops had no boats"
5877,III.,"to reach it; a good place for stopping, therefore, quite out of reach"
5878,III.,"of the savages. Nor is the fountain forgotten, ""sparkling water flowing"
5879,III.,"from a hollow rock down to the harbor""--an adjunct still necessary to"
5880,III.,"every Greek village or encampment. ""Some God led us through the dark"
5881,III.,"night"" without our seeing the island till the boats struck it--surely a"
5882,III.,providential intervention on our behalf.
5883,III.,
5884,III.,"Leaving behind the other ships at this point, Ulysses takes only his"
5885,III.,"own and its crew, and goes forth to ""test these people, whether just or"
5886,III.,"unjust, hospitable or godless."" He cannot rest in ignorance, he must"
5887,III.,"have the experience and know the unknown. He soon sees ""a cave high up"
5888,III.,"the mountain, not far from the sea, overarched with laurel shrubs;"" he"
5889,III.,"observes also ""an enclosure, made of stones set in the earth;"" these"
5890,III.,"stones are not hewn (as some translators say), since the so-called"
5891,III.,Cyclopean walls so common in Greece were not built by this kind of
5892,III.,"Cyclops. In the enclosure were resting ""many herds of sheep and"
5893,III.,"goats""--just such a scene as can be witnessed in the rural parts of"
5894,III.,"Greece to-day. This is the environment of ""the man-monster,"" who is now"
5895,III.,to be the theme of song.
5896,III.,
5897,III.,II. Polyphemus is a Cyclops but he has characteristics of his own. He
5898,III.,"has no family in his cave, he lives wholly for himself apparently; he"
5899,III.,"seems to be the largest of his race, ""like no man who lives by bread;"""
5900,III.,"he towers alone ""like the peak of a high mountain shaggy with woods;"""
5901,III.,"apart from others ""he plans his unjust deeds."" A portentous shape with"
5902,III.,"but a single eye in his head, a cave-dweller similar to the primitive"
5903,III.,man; he has too an evil disposition in his huge bulk.
5904,III.,
5905,III.,"This is the being with whom Ulysses is now to engage in conflict, which"
5906,III.,becomes highly dramatic. The conquest of the man of Nature by the man
5907,III.,of Intelligence--such is the theme through its various fluctuations.
5908,III.,"This man of Nature, however, we are always to consider from his"
5909,III.,"negative side, as hostile to a civilized order; so the poet has"
5910,III.,carefully represented him. He is to be put down; yet even Polyphemus
5911,III.,"has his right, he is brought to a gleam of self-knowledge, and Ulysses"
5912,III.,"has to pay the penalty of his deed, which has also its curse. A very"
5913,III.,"deep current runs through the poem in this part, which we shall divide"
5914,III.,"into five different scenes, hoping thus to make its movement and"
5915,III.,thought somewhat more distinct.
5916,III.,
5917,III.,"1. Ulysses, taking twelve of his bravest companions from his ship, not"
5918,III.,"forgetting a goatskin of wonderful wine, for he had a presentiment that"
5919,III.,"he would meet a huge wild man, who is wont to succumb readily to"
5920,III.,"civilized drink, enters the cave while Polyphemus is absent. A vivid"
5921,III.,"picture of that primitive dairy with its cheese, milk, curds; the men"
5922,III.,"fell to and helped themselves, as was natural. Then the companions"
5923,III.,"wished to depart at once, taking what quantity of cheese they could"
5924,III.,"carry, but Ulysses refused, he must ""see the Cyclops and test his"
5925,III.,"hospitality."" Just the opposite was the case in the land of the"
5926,III.,Ciconians; there Ulysses wished to flee but his companions would not.
5927,III.,"Why this difference? He must know Polyphemus, must see the giant and"
5928,III.,"subordinate him; that is just his supreme necessity now, he really can"
5929,III.,no more run away from the monster than from himself. But that attack on
5930,III.,"the Ciconians was an unjust, violent deed of which the penalty was sure"
5931,III.,"to follow; this Ulysses knew and sought to escape. In the present case,"
5932,III.,"however, no wrong has been done as yet, and he must meet and solve his"
5933,III.,"problem, while his weaker companions would shun the trial."
5934,III.,
5935,III.,"Polyphemus returns with his herds in due time, and closes the mouth of"
5936,III.,"the cave with a huge rock, ""which not two and twenty wains could move"
5937,III.,"from the threshold."" Soon by the light of his fire he sees the lurking"
5938,III.,"strangers and asks, ""Who are you?"" Ulysses replies, stating that they"
5939,III.,"are returning from Troy, but have been driven out of their way by"
5940,III.,adverse winds; then he makes his human and religious appeal: We come as
5941,III.,"suppliants, receive us; ""revere the Gods,"" specially Zeus the protector"
5942,III.,of suppliants. But the Cyclops scoffs at Zeus and the rest of the Gods:
5943,III.,"""we are their betters."" Thus is witnessed in the monster the denial of"
5944,III.,"the Greek religion, and an atheistic turn of mind."
5945,III.,
5946,III.,"Next follows in logical sequence his supreme negative act, he is a"
5947,III.,"man-eater. ""He seized two of my companions and hurled them against the"
5948,III.,"ground as if they were dogs, then he devoured them piecemeal,"
5949,III.,"swallowing all--entrails and flesh and marrowy bones."" Surely Ulysses"
5950,III.,is getting some experience on the line of that Trojan deed.
5951,III.,
5952,III.,Now we catch the entire sweep of this particular Cyclops. He has shown
5953,III.,himself as the representative of three mighty negations: of civilized
5954,III.,"life, of religious life, and of human life. He destroys man, feeds on"
5955,III.,"him; so negation, war, revolution, must do in the end. The horrid"
5956,III.,phantasm is the true image of the destroyer of the race. Nor does he
5957,III.,belong to the old Greek world and to the Trojan time only; he is among
5958,III.,"us, and he can be translated into modern terms quite familiar."
5959,III.,"Polyphemus is an anarchist, an atheist, and a cannibal; the ancient"
5960,III.,poet wraps the three together in one mighty monstrosity. In the morning
5961,III.,"the Cyclops devoured two more companions for his breakfast, then drove"
5962,III.,"his flocks afield, leaving the rest of the strangers shut up in the"
5963,III.,cave with the big stone in the opening.
5964,III.,
5965,III.,"During the day the ""man of many shifts"" has an opportunity for"
5966,III.,"reflection in that dark recess. He dares not kill the giant outright,"
5967,III.,"""with my sharp sword stubbing him where the midriff holds the liver,"""
5968,III.,"for how could they then get out? No, the man of nature must be saved"
5969,III.,and utilized; with all his might he is to be overborne by the man of
5970,III.,"intelligence, and made to remove the big stone."
5971,III.,
5972,III.,2. The plan of Ulysses with its successful execution is the subject of
5973,III.,the next phase of the conflict. By this plan three things must be done
5974,III.,in order to counteract the giant and to negative his power. He must be
5975,III.,"deprived of physical vision, which becomes the more easily possible"
5976,III.,from the fact that he has but one eye; if he had two eyes like the
5977,III.,"ordinary man, he could still see though one be put out. That this"
5978,III.,"purpose be accomplished, he must somehow be shorn of his physical"
5979,III.,strength; finally any resistance which might come from the rest of the
5980,III.,Cyclops outside must be rendered nugatory. Such are the three chief
5981,III.,"points of the impending problem, which Ulysses has to meet and does"
5982,III.,"meet with astonishing skill and foresight; the Cyclops is blinded, is"
5983,III.,"made helpless by drink, and is befooled by a pun."
5984,III.,
5985,III.,Ulysses burns out the eye of the monster with the charred end of a
5986,III.,"stick of olive wood, which he prepares beforehand; huge Round-eye (the"
5987,III.,meaning of the word _Cyclops_) has no eye now. Ulysses by means of that
5988,III.,"miraculous wine, product of culture, makes the giant drunk, who thus"
5989,III.,"loses his physical superiority. The Ithacan evidently knew, as well as"
5990,III.,"the American, the power of fire-water over the wild man; that the wine"
5991,III.,"had some strength, is shown by the fact that one cup of it had to be"
5992,III.,"diluted with twenty measures of water, when taken by ordinary mortals."
5993,III.,Not without significance does the exhilarated Cyclops laud this
5994,III.,civilized wine in contrast to that of the wild grapes of his own land.
5995,III.,
5996,III.,"But the third scheme of Ulysses is the most subtle of all, and touches"
5997,III.,"the heart of the whole problem, though it be merely a pun. He calls"
5998,III.,"himself Nobody to Polyphemus, who, without sight or insight, is the"
5999,III.,victim of a word. For a complete man must have not only a double sight
6000,III.,"from his eyes, but a double insight from his mind, seeing before and"
6001,III.,after in the latter case especially. The result is when the other
6002,III.,"Cyclops, roused by the cries of Polyphemus, ask him from outside the"
6003,III.,"cave: What is the matter? he answers, Nobody is killing me. Whereat off"
6004,III.,"they go, dropping a word or two of cold advice, or perchance of"
6005,III.,sarcastic humor.
6006,III.,
6007,III.,"We should, however, reach down to the essence of what appears on the"
6008,III.,"surface as a mere trick of speech. It may seem far-fetched to say, but"
6009,III.,"it is none the less the actual fact, that Ulysses is a Nobody, and a"
6010,III.,"very active one to Polyphemus. That is, he has shown himself the"
6011,III.,"negative power which overwhelms the giant, who is now himself quite"
6012,III.,"reduced to a nobody by Mr. Nobody. Or, in abstract terms, Ulysses has"
6013,III.,negated the negation and has here suggested the subtle work of the
6014,III.,"process in doing so. Has he not negatived Polyphemus, who was himself a"
6015,III.,"negative, so carefully and fully defined by the poet at the start?"
6016,III.,
6017,III.,"Thus we come upon the deepest pun ever made, or possible to be made, a"
6018,III.,literary form which the greatest geniuses have been fond of sporting
6019,III.,"with; we can find puns in Dante, Goethe, and notably in Shakespeare."
6020,III.,The pun of Ulysses rests upon the duplicity inherent in the negative;
6021,III.,"no-man is the man, especially to Polyphemus, whose brain cannot span"
6022,III.,"the two sides of the punning idea, who is not two-eyed but one-eyed by"
6023,III.,"nature, and this one eye is soon put out by the man with two eyes. Such"
6024,III.,is the earliest instance of what may be called the Play of the
6025,III.,"Negative, which is still subtly ensconced in the spoken and written"
6026,III.,"word, and winds in an elusive game of hide-and-seek through all"
6027,III.,"Literature. Many men, both writers and readers, are its victims, like"
6028,III.,Polyphemus.
6029,III.,
6030,III.,"And all these floating metaphysical gossamers are found in Homer! Yes,"
6031,III.,"but not in a metaphysical form; Homer's organ is poetic, he lived in"
6032,III.,the age ere philosophers had dawned. Still he too had before him the
6033,III.,problems of the soul and of the world. Nor would he have been a true
6034,III.,"Greek unless he had grappled with this Play of the Negative, which had"
6035,III.,some marvelous fascination for the Greek mind. It is the leaven working
6036,III.,"in the Sophists with their subtle rhetoric, in Socrates with his"
6037,III.,"negating elenchus, in Plato with his confounding dialectic. Homer, as"
6038,III.,"the prophet of his people, foreshadowing all forms of Greek spirit and"
6039,III.,"of Greek literature, bring to light repeatedly this Play of the"
6040,III.,Negative.
6041,III.,
6042,III.,"The modern German, in more respects than one the spiritual heir of the"
6043,III.,"ancient Greek, has not failed to give evidence of his birthright in the"
6044,III.,"same direction. Kant's Critique, and Hegel's Logic are the most"
6045,III.,"desperate efforts to grasp this slippery, double-doing and"
6046,III.,"double-thinking Negative, infinitely elusive, verily the old Serpent."
6047,III.,"But the supreme attempt is the modern poetic one, made by Goethe in his"
6048,III.,"Faust poem, in which is embodied anew the mighty Negative, who is now"
6049,III.,"none other than the devil, Mephistopheles. Thus the last world-poet"
6050,III.,reaches across the ages and touches elbows with the first world-poet in
6051,III.,a common theme.
6052,III.,
6053,III.,"Thus Ulysses nullifies the Cyclops, inflicting three deprivations"
6054,III.,"through his three means: the charred stick takes away vision, the"
6055,III.,"strong wine takes away strength, the ambiguous pun prevents help. The"
6056,III.,pun also announces covertly to Polyphemus the nature of the power which
6057,III.,"is undoing him, but he does not and cannot understand that. But the"
6058,III.,problem of Ulysses is not at an end with simply nullifying the Cyclops;
6059,III.,he and his companions are not yet outside of the cave. Herewith we come
6060,III.,to a new stage of process.
6061,III.,
6062,III.,"3. This is the escape, to which the strong giant must be made to"
6063,III.,"contribute, he is skillfully turned against himself. The great stone is"
6064,III.,"removed by him from the mouth of the cave, but he places himself there"
6065,III.,"at the entrance, and no human being can pass. Still, the herds have to"
6066,III.,go out to their pasture. Ulysses dexterously binds three large sheep
6067,III.,"together, fastens a companion under the middle one, while he clings"
6068,III.,"beneath a huge ram, and out they move together. But the giant stops"
6069,III.,"just this ram and talks to it, being his favorite of the flock. The man"
6070,III.,"of nature is again outwitted by the man of intelligence, allowing his"
6071,III.,enemy to slip through his very fingers. The conversation of the blind
6072,III.,Cyclops with the dumb animal is pathetic; his one solitary friend
6073,III.,"apparently, the only creature he loved, is compelled to silent service"
6074,III.,"against its master. ""Why art thou last to leave, who wast always first?"
6075,III.,"Dost thou long to see the eye of thy ruler, which has been put out by"
6076,III.,"that vile wretch, Nobody?"" So the Cyclops speaks, without seeing or"
6077,III.,"knowing, yet with a touch which excites sympathy for his misfortune."
6078,III.,
6079,III.,The special characteristic of this scene is that Ulysses does not now
6080,III.,"destroy, but employs Polyphemus and his property. Nature must be used"
6081,III.,by intelligence to overcome nature; the strength of the giant must be
6082,III.,directed to rolling away the big stone; his herds are taken to bring
6083,III.,"about the escape of his foes, and he is turned into an instrument"
6084,III.,"against himself. Thus he is no longer negated as in the last scene, but"
6085,III.,"utilized; having been subdued, he now must serve."
6086,III.,
6087,III.,"Ulysses and his companions are outside the cave, having gotten rid of"
6088,III.,those dark and fearful limits which walled them in with a monster.
6089,III.,"Mind, thought has released them; soon they are on their ship in a free"
6090,III.,"element. But the end is not yet; even Polyphemus, the natural man, must"
6091,III.,"come to know who and what has subjected him, he too is in the grand"
6092,III.,discipline of the time.
6093,III.,
6094,III.,4. Two things Ulysses is now to tell to the Cyclops in the distance.
6095,III.,"The first is the wrong and the penalty thereof: ""Amply have thy evil"
6096,III.,"deeds been returned to thee,"" namely, his treatment of men. ""Zeus and"
6097,III.,"the other Gods have punished thee,"" there is a divine order in the"
6098,III.,"world, which looks after the wrong-doer. Thus Polyphemus the anarchist,"
6099,III.,"atheist, and cannibal gets a short missionary sermon on justice,"
6100,III.,"religion and humanity. But he does not receive it kindly, he ""hurls a"
6101,III.,"fragment of a mountain peak,"" and almost strikes the ship. The line of"
6102,III.,danger is not yet passed.
6103,III.,
6104,III.,Still Ulysses must tell something else though his frightened companions
6105,III.,"try to dissuade him. But he must, he cannot help it: ""If any one ask"
6106,III.,"thee, say it was Ulysses, the city-destroyer, who put out thine eye."" A"
6107,III.,"great light this word brings to the poor blind Cyclops, almost the"
6108,III.,"light of self-consciousness. He recalls, he knows his conqueror, and"
6109,III.,"therein begins to know himself, to recognize his error. ""Ah, woe is me!"
6110,III.,"the ancient oracles about me are fulfilled!"" Of old there had been"
6111,III.,"prophecies concerning his destiny, but he did not understand them,"
6112,III.,"seemingly did not regard them. How could he, with his bent toward the"
6113,III.,"godless? The prophet Telemus had foretold ""that I would lose my sight"
6114,III.,"at the hands of Ulysses."" How shall we consider this prophecy? A dim,"
6115,III.,far-off presentiment among the Cyclops themselves that they were to be
6116,III.,"subjected to a higher influence; their limited, one-eyed vision was to"
6117,III.,"vanish through a more universal, two-eyed vision. Such a presentiment"
6118,III.,"nature everywhere shows, a presentiment of the power beyond her, of the"
6119,III.,"spiritual. What else indeed is Gravitation? A longing, a seeking which"
6120,III.,"even the clod manifests in its fall earthward, a prophetic intimation;"
6121,III.,"so the Cyclops, the natural man, had his prophet whom he now begins"
6122,III.,"rightly to recognize; truly he is getting religious, quite different is"
6123,III.,"his present utterance from his previous blasphemy: ""we are better than"
6124,III.,"the Gods."" Nay, he offers to intercede with his father Neptune, praying"
6125,III.,the God to give a sending of the stranger over the sea. Moreover he
6126,III.,recognizes his divine father as the only one who can heal him in his
6127,III.,"present distress. Possibly the words are spoken to beguile, but"
6128,III.,"Polyphemus here offers to do his duty to the stranger on his shores,"
6129,III.,and he recognizes the Gods.
6130,III.,
6131,III.,Manifestly we witness in this passage a striking development of the
6132,III.,rude Cyclops under the tough discipline of experience. He acknowledges
6133,III.,"first his mistake in regard to the prophecy: ""I expected to see a man"
6134,III.,"tall and beautiful and of vast strength, not this petty worthless"
6135,III.,"weakling who has put out mine eye."" A hero of visible might, a giant"
6136,III.,"like himself, not a man of invisible intelligence, he imagined he was"
6137,III.,to meet; great was his mistake. The conflict between Brain and Brawn
6138,III.,"was settled long ago before Troy, and has been sung of in the preceding"
6139,III.,"Book. Here then is certainly a confession of his mistake, and, if his"
6140,III.,"words are sincere, an offer to undo his wrong."
6141,III.,
6142,III.,"5. At this point there is a change in Ulysses, his victory has begotten"
6143,III.,"insolence, he becomes a kind of Cyclops in his turn. Such is the demon"
6144,III.,ever lurking in success. Listen to his response to the confession and
6145,III.,"supplication of his wretched victim: ""Would that I were as sure of"
6146,III.,"taking thy life and sending thee down to Hades, as that the"
6147,III.,"Earth-shaker shall never heal thine eye."" The implication is that the"
6148,III.,God cannot do it--an act of blasphemy which the God will not be slow to
6149,III.,"avenge. But how true to human nature is this new turn in Ulysses, how"
6150,III.,profound! No sooner has he escaped and experiences the feeling of
6151,III.,"triumph, than his humanity, nay his religion vanishes, he sweeps over"
6152,III.,into his opposite and becomes his savage enemy. What follows? The law
6153,III.,"must be read to him too, his own law; he will hear it from the mouth of"
6154,III.,"Polyphemus, and it is essentially this: As thou hast done to me, so"
6155,III.,shall it be done to thee.
6156,III.,
6157,III.,Accordingly we have next the curse of the Cyclops denounced upon the
6158,III.,"head of the transgressor. This curse is to be fulfilled to the letter,"
6159,III.,"the poet has fully shown the ground of it, Ulysses has really invoked"
6160,III.,"it upon himself, it lies in his deed. Possibly Polyphemus, when he"
6161,III.,"offered to give the dues of hospitality and to send the guest home, was"
6162,III.,"merely using the words of deception, which he had just had the"
6163,III.,"opportunity of learning, and was trying to get possession of his"
6164,III.,enemy's body. Doubtless it was well for Ulysses to keep out of the
6165,III.,"giant's hands. But that does not justify his speech, which was both"
6166,III.,cruel and blasphemous.
6167,III.,
6168,III.,"Hear then the curse of the Cyclops, which hints the great obstructing"
6169,III.,"motive to the return of Ulysses, and marks out the action of the poem;"
6170,III.,"""Give Ulysses no return to his home; but if he returns, may he arrive"
6171,III.,"late and in evil plight, upon a foreign ship with loss of all his"
6172,III.,"companions, and may he find troubles in his house."" Of course Neptune"
6173,III.,"heard the prayer, had to hear it, in the divine order of things. The"
6174,III.,"curse lay inside of Ulysses, else it could not have been fulfilled; he"
6175,III.,himself could drop from his humane and religious mood in adversity and
6176,III.,become a savage in prosperity. His chief misfortunes follow after this
6177,III.,"curse. But for the present he escapes to Goat Island, though another"
6178,III.,portentous rock is hurled at him by the Cyclops. There he sacrifices to
6179,III.,"the Highest God, Zeus, who, however, pays no heed--how is it possible?"
6180,III.,
6181,III.,"Such is this far-reaching Fairy Tale, certainly one of the greatest and"
6182,III.,"most comprehensive ever written. It shows a movement, an evolution both"
6183,III.,of Polyphemus and Ulysses; this inner unfolding indeed is the main
6184,III.,thing to be grasped. It is worth the while to take a short retrospect
6185,III.,of the five leading points. (1) The completely negative character of
6186,III.,"the Cyclops as to institutions, religion, and even the physical man."
6187,III.,"(2) This negative being is negated by the man of intelligence, who puts"
6188,III.,"out his eye, nullifies his strength by drink, and thwarts all help for"
6189,III.,him by a punning stratagem. (3) He is made to help his enemies escape
6190,III.,from his cave by the skill of Ulysses who turns the force of nature
6191,III.,"against nature. (4) The Cyclops reaches self-knowledge through Ulysses,"
6192,III.,"who tells his wrong and its punishment, who also tells his own name:"
6193,III.,whereat the Cyclops suddenly changes and makes a humane offer. (5)
6194,III.,"Ulysses changes the other way, becomes himself a kind of Cyclops and"
6195,III.,receives the curse.
6196,III.,
6197,III.,This curse will now follow Ulysses and drive him from island to island
6198,III.,"through Fableland, till he gets back to Ithaca with much suffering and"
6199,III.,"with all companions lost, where he will find many troubles. In this"
6200,III.,manner the return of Ulysses becomes intertwined with Polyphemus and
6201,III.,"this Fableland, which furnish an underlying motive for the third Part"
6202,III.,of the Odyssey (the last 12 Books). The curse here spoken is still
6203,III.,working when Ulysses reaches home and finds the suitors in possession.
6204,III.,"Verily his negative spirit lies deep; in cursing Polyphemus, he has"
6205,III.,cursed himself.
6206,III.,
6207,III.,Thus the impartial poet shows both sides--the guilt as well as the good
6208,III.,in Polyphemus and in Ulysses. The man of nature has his right when he
6209,III.,"offers to transform his conduct, and it shows that Ulysses still needs"
6210,III.,discipline when he scorns such an offer. Polyphemus too is to have his
6211,III.,"chance of rising, for he certainly has within himself the possibility."
6212,III.,Has not the poet derived the noble Arete and Alcinous and institutional
6213,III.,Phæacia from the savage Cyclops? But Ulysses negatives Polyphemus just
6214,III.,at the start upward. The character which he showed in sacking the city
6215,III.,"of the Ciconians is in him still, he is not yet ready to return."
6216,III.,
6217,III.,The Ninth Book has thus run through its three stages and has landed us
6218,III.,"in pure Fableland. These three stages--the attack on the Ciconians,"
6219,III.,"the Lotus-eaters, the adventure with the Cyclops--may now be seen to"
6220,III.,"be parts of one entire process, which we may call the purification of"
6221,III.,"the spirit from its own negative condition. The man, having become"
6222,III.,"destructive-minded (_oloophrn_) must be put under training by the Gods,"
6223,III.,and sent to battle with the monsters of Fableland.
6224,III.,
6225,III.,So we advance to the next Book with the certainty that there is still
6226,III.,some stern discipline in store for the wandering Ulysses.

6231,_BOOK TENTH._,_BOOK TENTH._
6232,_BOOK TENTH._,
6233,_BOOK TENTH._,
6234,_BOOK TENTH._,At the first glance we can observe a certain similarity between this
6235,_BOOK TENTH._,Book and the last one. There are in each three distinct portions or
6236,_BOOK TENTH._,"adventures, two very short and simple, and one very long and intricate."
6237,_BOOK TENTH._,Each Book culminates in a fabulous being with whom the Hero has a
6238,_BOOK TENTH._,"wrestle for supremacy, and in both cases he comes out victorious. We"
6239,_BOOK TENTH._,"are still in Wonderland, we have to reach into the ideal realm in order"
6240,_BOOK TENTH._,to find out what these strange incidents mean. The two central figures
6241,_BOOK TENTH._,"are Polyphemus and Circe, respectively, each of whom imparts the"
6242,_BOOK TENTH._,dominating thought to the Book in which he or she appears.
6243,_BOOK TENTH._,
6244,_BOOK TENTH._,"The first thing we ask for is the connection, the inner thread which"
6245,_BOOK TENTH._,joins these Books together. It was stated that Polyphemus was the
6246,_BOOK TENTH._,"negation of the institutional world, he was individualistic, he"
6247,_BOOK TENTH._,"belonged to neither Family nor State. No laws, no councils, no civil"
6248,_BOOK TENTH._,"polity; he is a huge man of violence, hostile specially to man's social"
6249,_BOOK TENTH._,"life. Circe on the contrary, is the woman hostile to woman's domestic"
6250,_BOOK TENTH._,"world, the Family, first of all; she is the grand enchantress,"
6251,_BOOK TENTH._,representing the power and seductiveness of the senses; she is the
6252,_BOOK TENTH._,"enemy of what we call morals. To be sure, we shall find in her"
6253,_BOOK TENTH._,"something more, whereof the full unfolding will be given hereafter."
6254,_BOOK TENTH._,
6255,_BOOK TENTH._,Ulysses is the one who is to meet those negative forces and put them
6256,_BOOK TENTH._,"down. His companions give him special trouble in the present Book, they"
6257,_BOOK TENTH._,"seem to represent the weaker phases of man, possibly of Ulysses"
6258,_BOOK TENTH._,"himself. Already he has suppressed Polyphemus, or the institutional"
6259,_BOOK TENTH._,negation; now he is to subordinate Circe or the moral negation. The
6260,_BOOK TENTH._,latter is a woman because she must have sensuous beauty and all the
6261,_BOOK TENTH._,charm of passionate enticement; the former is a man because he must
6262,_BOOK TENTH._,show strength and violence rather than the allurement of pleasure.
6263,_BOOK TENTH._,
6264,_BOOK TENTH._,"Nor should we forget that these forms are in Ulysses himself, and were"
6265,_BOOK TENTH._,"really generated out of his Trojan life; that spirit of his, shown at"
6266,_BOOK TENTH._,"the start by the attack on the Ciconians, has all these phases in its"
6267,_BOOK TENTH._,"process. He is traveling through an Inferno, seeing its entire demonic"
6268,_BOOK TENTH._,"brood, which he has begotten, and which he has to fight and subject. At"
6269,_BOOK TENTH._,"the same time these fantastic shapes are typical, and shadow forth the"
6270,_BOOK TENTH._,"universal experience of man, belonging to all countries and all ages."
6271,_BOOK TENTH._,
6272,_BOOK TENTH._,"As already stated, there are three different localities to which"
6273,_BOOK TENTH._,"Ulysses is brought. Three islands, bounded, yet in a boundless sea,"
6274,_BOOK TENTH._,through which he moves on his ships; such is the outermost setting of
6275,_BOOK TENTH._,"nature, suggestive of much. No tempest occurs in this Book; the stress"
6276,_BOOK TENTH._,is upon the three fixed places in the unfixed aqueous element.
6277,_BOOK TENTH._,
6278,_BOOK TENTH._,I. First is the island where dwells Æolus with his Family; hither
6279,_BOOK TENTH._,Ulysses comes after putting down Polyphemus who was hostile to domestic
6280,_BOOK TENTH._,life. In this spot the bag of winds is given into the possession of the
6281,_BOOK TENTH._,"navigator, whose companions, however, release them, and he is driven to"
6282,_BOOK TENTH._,"the starting-point, with the winds at large. Æolus refuses to receive"
6283,_BOOK TENTH._,him the second time.
6284,_BOOK TENTH._,
6285,_BOOK TENTH._,"II. Next is the city of the Læstrigonians, where is a civil life, a"
6286,_BOOK TENTH._,"State, to which Ulysses can come after subjecting the Cyclops, who had"
6287,_BOOK TENTH._,"no polity of the sort. But the State is verily a giant, a cannibal to"
6288,_BOOK TENTH._,"him now, with all the winds loose. Hence he has to flee for his life."
6289,_BOOK TENTH._,Whither now does he go?
6290,_BOOK TENTH._,
6291,_BOOK TENTH._,"III. Not to Penelope and Ithaca, but to Circe, and her isle. She is the"
6292,_BOOK TENTH._,"form which next rises before Ulysses, banished from the domestic world"
6293,_BOOK TENTH._,"of Æolus, and fleeing from the civil life of the Læstrigonians."
6294,_BOOK TENTH._,
6295,_BOOK TENTH._,"We shall try to bring the threads of connection to light, for it is our"
6296,_BOOK TENTH._,emphatic opinion that these three islands with their shapes are
6297,_BOOK TENTH._,"spiritually bound and wound together. Still further, they reach back"
6298,_BOOK TENTH._,"and interlink with the forms of the previous Book, which furnish"
6299,_BOOK TENTH._,antecedent stages of the grand total movement of Fairyland. Separated
6300,_BOOK TENTH._,"in image are these islands and their inhabitants, but they have to be"
6301,_BOOK TENTH._,"united in thought. Not a mere accident is the sequence, but a"
6302,_BOOK TENTH._,"necessity, a strict evolution. The work here, according our best"
6303,_BOOK TENTH._,"belief, is organic, and the reader must not rest contented with his"
6304,_BOOK TENTH._,"understanding of it, till he moves with the poet from place to place by"
6305,_BOOK TENTH._,the interior path of the spirit.
6306,_BOOK TENTH._,
6307,_BOOK TENTH._,
6308,I.,I.
6309,I.,
6310,I.,The first fact about the Æolian Isle is that it was afloat in the
6311,I.,"waters of the sea, as Delos and other islands of antiquity were"
6312,I.,"reported to be. Not stationary then; the king of it, Æolus, has a name"
6313,I.,"which indicates a changeable nature, veering about like the winds, of"
6314,I.,which he is king. The second fact pertaining to this Isle is that a
6315,I.,"wall of brass encircles it not to be broken through; ""and the cliff"
6316,I.,"runs up sheer from the sea."" Manifestly two opposite ideas are"
6317,I.,suggested in this description: the fixed and the movable; the island
6318,I.,"within itself is bound fast, and cannot be driven asunder; yet it"
6319,I.,"floats in the most unstable of elements, in the sea and winds. Such is"
6320,I.,"the physical environment, clearly mirroring the meaning. Something"
6321,I.,permanent in the midst of all that is mutable we may expect to find
6322,I.,here.
6323,I.,
6324,I.,"On the island dwell the King of the Winds and his wife, along with six"
6325,I.,blooming sons and daughters. He gave his daughters to his sons for
6326,I.,wives; a custom not elsewhere found in Homer outside of the realm of
6327,I.,"the Gods; yet is claimed to have been a very ancient custom, which the"
6328,I.,Ptolomies revived in Egypt. At any rate here is the picture of the
6329,I.,"Family in its patriarchal form, wholly separated from other connections"
6330,I.,"and set apart by itself, on the brass-bound precipitous island. The"
6331,I.,Family is abstracted from the rest of the world and given a
6332,I.,dwelling-place.
6333,I.,
6334,I.,At this point we begin to catch a glimpse of the significance of the
6335,I.,story. The Family is the first power which seizes the emotions and
6336,I.,passions and caprices of men (the winds of his soul) and starts the
6337,I.,"taming of them; the marriage tie is fixed, is not for a day; thus the"
6338,I.,"Family makes itself permanent, and makes the human being stable through"
6339,I.,feeling and duty. None but married people are here; very different will
6340,I.,it be hereafter in the island of Circe. The king of the winds is not
6341,I.,"only Æolus, but also his institution, the Family, rules here, for there"
6342,I.,"is no State to be governed. Not polygamy, but monogamy, as the great"
6343,I.,"Homeric principle of domestic life, do we witness--the mutual devotion"
6344,I.,of one man and one woman. Externally we found the fixed and the
6345,I.,"floating; internally also we discover the fixed and the floating, or"
6346,I.,"rather, that principle which fixes the floating, and makes the world"
6347,I.,stable. Thus we see the reason why Homer puts the Family upon the Isle
6348,I.,of the Winds.
6349,I.,
6350,I.,"It is no wonder, therefore, that in such a place is held up before us a"
6351,I.,"picture of happiness and plenty. ""All feast from day to day with"
6352,I.,"endless change of meats;"" why ask whence the viands come? The inner"
6353,I.,"peace provides them. Even the sound of flutes is heard round about,"
6354,I.,according to one way of translating the passage; music attunes the
6355,I.,"everlasting festival. Not mere gratification is this, but happiness,"
6356,I.,the outer again mirroring the inner; domestic harmony is the matter set
6357,I.,forth.
6358,I.,
6359,I.,"Hither Ulysses comes with his companions, ""to the city and beautiful"
6360,I.,"houses"" of Æolus. A city is here, but no civil life is introduced into"
6361,I.,"the story. ""A whole month the monarch entertained me;"" what was again"
6362,I.,"the interest? ""He asked me about Ilium,"" the eternal theme, which lies"
6363,I.,always in the background of Fairyland as well as of Historic Hellas.
6364,I.,"The Trojan war and also ""the Return of the Greeks"" were recounted, we"
6365,I.,"may say, sung by Ulysses; the Iliad and the Odyssey, delighted also"
6366,I.,those domestic Æolians. Was not Troy destroyed because of a wrong done
6367,I.,to the Greek Family? Finally Ulysses was gotten ready to be sent home
6368,I.,by his host.
6369,I.,
6370,I.,"Æolus, the ruler of the winds, gives them into the might of Ulysses; he"
6371,I.,"confines them in ""a bullock's bladder,"" which, tied by a silver chain,"
6372,I.,"he places in the ship. It is manifest that the sea, deprived of these"
6373,I.,"windy powers, cannot hinder the passage. Again we behold the main fact"
6374,I.,"of the island: the unstable, uncertain, capricious, is held by the"
6375,I.,"fixed, the permanent; during his sojourn with Æolus, Ulysses has"
6376,I.,"obtained an inner hold, an anchorage of the moral kind, which he sorely"
6377,I.,"needed. This was given him by his view of the Family, which was the"
6378,I.,real security of the island. All the conditions of his return (but one)
6379,I.,"are placed in his hand, tied up in a bag. ""Only the west-wind was"
6380,I.,"allowed to blow,"" which sent him homewards."
6381,I.,
6382,I.,"Still the supreme condition was not, could not be given by Æolus or by"
6383,I.,"anybody else, could not be tied up in a bag. The free man must be"
6384,I.,"alert, he must watch, and win his own salvation; his prime duty is to"
6385,I.,"keep the bag tied, and therein to exercise his will. This is just what"
6386,I.,he failed to do at the last moment. He went to sleep when in sight of
6387,I.,"Ithaca; his companions, led by curiosity and avarice (two blasts of the"
6388,I.,"soul) open the bag, expecting to find gold and silver, and find the"
6389,I.,"rushing winds. Of course all are driven back to the starting-point, to"
6390,I.,"the island, on which they soon land."
6391,I.,
6392,I.,"What will Ulysses do in such extremity? ""Shall I drop into the sea and"
6393,I.,"perish, or shall I still endure and stay among the living?"" Suicide"
6394,I.,"will not solve his problem: ""I remained and suffered."" Herein also we"
6395,I.,"trace the stamp of the hero, whose special call it is to master fate."
6396,I.,
6397,I.,"So Ulysses tries again to get the bladder of winds from Æolus,"
6398,I.,confessing that it was equally the fault of himself and his companions.
6399,I.,"But the opportunity is gone; the sum total of conditions, all bagged"
6400,I.,"and tied up, and put into his hands, presents itself only once."
6401,I.,"Moreover the sleep of Ulysses, just at the nick of destiny, showed an"
6402,I.,"internal weakness; he became careless, almost insolent under such"
6403,I.,circumstances; he manifested a similar trait to that which led to the
6404,I.,"curse of the Cyclops. Again he hears a malediction, now uttered by his"
6405,I.,"former host: ""Get thee out of my island quickly, most guilty of men,"
6406,I.,"hated by the Gods!"" Thus Æolus regards the man before him, and"
6407,I.,reinforces the curse of Polyphemus. But if Ulysses had to fall asleep
6408,I.,"by sheer fatigue (which construction the passage hardly demands), then"
6409,I.,"he did not look properly after his companions, making them the sharers"
6410,I.,of his knowledge. A foolish question has been asked here and much
6411,I.,discussed: How did Ulysses know what his companions said during his
6412,I.,sleep? Easily enough; but the answer is not worth the candle.
6413,I.,
6414,I.,"Æolus, therefore, refuses to receive Ulysses and his companions a"
6415,I.,"second time; they have fallen, they must experience the full meaning of"
6416,I.,"their conduct; they must go to Circe, and some of them, at least, be"
6417,I.,"changed into swine, till they know the nature of their deed. Æolus"
6418,I.,"cannot receive them, they have destroyed his gift; they would repeat"
6419,I.,"their act, if he gave all into their hands again, without the deeper"
6420,I.,"penalty. The law thus is clear; they, having disregarded the fixed"
6421,I.,"control of appetite and passion, which the King of the Island imparts,"
6422,I.,are swept back into brutishness.
6423,I.,
6424,I.,Many have been the interpretations of this marvelous King and his
6425,I.,children and his island. The supporters of the physical theory of
6426,I.,mythology have maintained that the twelve sons and daughters are the
6427,I.,"twelve months of the year, six of summer and six of winter, while"
6428,I.,"Æolus, the father, is the Sun who produces them. Others regard Æolus as"
6429,I.,"a mortal king, who, on account of certain traits or certain deeds, was"
6430,I.,transformed into the fabled monarch of the winds. There has been much
6431,I.,dispute over the location of Æolia; the most of those who have searched
6432,I.,"for its geographical site are in favor of one of the Lipari Islands, on"
6433,I.,the northern coast of Sicily. Finally Virgil has somewhat transformed
6434,I.,the legend and put it into his Æneid.
6435,I.,
6436,I.,
6437,II.,II.
6438,II.,
6439,II.,Ulysses and his companions now had to use the oar on seas without wind;
6440,II.,"""their spirit was worn out,"" hope had fled from them toiling through"
6441,II.,"the becalmed deep. They arrive at the land of the Læstrigonians, a race"
6442,II.,"of giants, into whose narrow harbor surrounded by its high precipices"
6443,II.,"the ships enter, with the exception of that of Ulysses, who has learned"
6444,II.,"caution. A kind of cave of the Giant Despair is that harbor, reflecting"
6445,II.,"outwardly the internal condition of the men, after their weary labor"
6446,II.,coupled with the repulse from Æolus.
6447,II.,
6448,II.,First of all we here observe a city with a civil order; there is the
6449,II.,"place of assembly, a king over men, with a royal palace. No husbandry"
6450,II.,"appears, but there are wagons fetching wood to town on a smooth road"
6451,II.,"(probably a made road); shepherds are specially designated, so that we"
6452,II.,"may suppose a pastoral life prevails, yet these people in their city"
6453,II.,"are not roving nomads. The Family also is noticed, being composed of"
6454,II.,"the king, queen, and daughter; the latter is bringing water from the"
6455,II.,"town fountain--a primitive, idyllic touch. But the stress is manifestly"
6456,II.,not upon the domestic but the civil institution; the State is here in
6457,II.,"full operation, in which fact we mark the contrast with the preceding"
6458,II.,"island, Æolia. Another sharp contrast may be drawn between the"
6459,II.,"Læstrigonians and the Cyclops; the latter are giants also, but have no"
6460,II.,civil order.
6461,II.,
6462,II.,"Ulysses, therefore, witnesses the State, in due gradation after the"
6463,II.,"Family. He can come to both these institutions now, and see them at"
6464,II.,"least, for he has put down Polyphemus, who, we recollect, was the"
6465,II.,"negation of both. But only see them, not share in them; the curse of"
6466,II.,the Cyclops is still working upon him and in him; though he destroy a
6467,II.,"destroyer, that does not make him positive; the devil destroys the"
6468,II.,"wicked, but that does not make him good. Hence the State rejects him as"
6469,II.,did the Family; he is by no means ready to return to Ithaca and
6470,II.,Penelope. Such is his experience at present.
6471,II.,
6472,II.,But why should the Læstrigonians be portrayed as giants? Of course the
6473,II.,Fairy Tale deals in these huge beings for its own purpose. Æolus and
6474,II.,his children seem to have been of common stature. The fancy can often
6475,II.,"play into the meaning, or suggest a glimpse thereof. The State may be"
6476,II.,"called the Big Man, the concentrated personality of many persons; he"
6477,II.,"strikes hard, he overwhelms the wrong-doer. Therefore he seems now so"
6478,II.,"terrible to Ulysses, and is really so to the latter's companions, of"
6479,II.,whom all perish here except one shipful. It is the function of the
6480,II.,"State to punish; in the sweet domestic life of Æolus, there was no"
6481,II.,"punishment, only banishment; thus we behold now the penalty, at the"
6482,II.,hands of that institution which is specially to administer it. The
6483,II.,"companions did no wrong to the Læstrigonians, but note that just here"
6484,II.,"judgment comes upon them. Ulysses escapes, but to him also these people"
6485,II.,"appear as destroyers, as man-devouring cannibals; so the State often"
6486,II.,"seems to the guilty, overwhelming the individual with its penal"
6487,II.,vengeance.
6488,II.,
6489,II.,"The Cyclops was also a giant and a cannibal, full of hostility; but"
6490,II.,"mark the difference. He was the Strong Man of Nature, not human in"
6491,II.,"shape, with that one eye in his head; his violence was against"
6492,II.,"institutions, the violence of the wild barbarian, which has to be put"
6493,II.,down by man. But the Læstrigonians live in a civilized order which has
6494,II.,to punish the transgressor; their shapes are not monstrosities of
6495,II.,"nature, but magnified human bodies. Both are giants and cannibals, both"
6496,II.,"negative, but in a wholly different sense."
6497,II.,
6498,II.,What is the location of the Læstrigonians? A subject much disputed
6499,II.,"recently and of old, with very little profit. Some expressions are"
6500,II.,"puzzling: ""The herdsman coming in greets the herdsman going out;"" then"
6501,II.,"again, ""a herdsman needing no sleep would earn double wages,"" which"
6502,II.,"implies apparently two periods for toil in twenty-four hours, the one"
6503,II.,"""for tending cows"" and the other ""for tending sheep;"" and this is"
6504,II.,"possible, ""for the paths of day and night are near"" to each other, as"
6505,II.,if somehow day and night ran their courses together. What does it all
6506,II.,"mean? Some dim story of the polar world with its bright nights, which"
6507,II.,"story may have come from the far North into Greece, along with another"
6508,II.,"Northern product, amber, which was known to Homer, may lie at the basis"
6509,II.,of this curious passage. But we can hardly place the Læstrigonians
6510,II.,under polar skies in spite of this polar characteristic. Others have
6511,II.,sought their locality in the Black Sea and have even seen their harbor
6512,II.,"in that of Balaklava. All of which is uncertain enough, and destined to"
6513,II.,"remain so, but furnishes a marvelous field for erudite conjecture and"
6514,II.,"investigation. The certain matter here, and we should say the important"
6515,II.,"one also, is the institutional order and its negative attitude toward"
6516,II.,"Ulysses. That is, we must reach down and bring to light the ethical"
6517,II.,"thread which is spun through this wonderful texture of Fairy Tales,"
6518,II.,"before we have any real explanation, or connecting principle."
6519,II.,
6520,II.,
6521,III.,III.
6522,III.,
6523,III.,"Onward the wanderer, now with his single ship, has to sail again;"
6524,III.,"whither next? He arrives at another island called Ææa, ""where dwells"
6525,III.,"the fair-haired Circe, an awful Goddess, endowed with a singing voice,"
6526,III.,"own sister of the evil-minded wizard Æætes, both sprung of the Sun and"
6527,III.,"of Perse, daughter of Oceanus."""
6528,III.,
6529,III.,"This genealogy we have set down in full, as given by the poet, on"
6530,III.,"account of its suggestiveness. These names carry us back to the East,"
6531,III.,"quite to primitive Arya; here is the Sun, the God of the old Vedas;"
6532,III.,"here is Perse, curiously akin to Persia, which was light-worshiping in"
6533,III.,"her ancient religion; then we come to Æætes, father of Medea, usually"
6534,III.,"held to be of Colchis on the Eastern coast of the Black Sea, whence we"
6535,III.,"busily pass to Hellas in many a legend, and from Hellas we now have"
6536,III.,"traveled far westward into Fairyland. One ancient story, probably the"
6537,III.,"first, placed Circe in the remote East; another, this of Homer for"
6538,III.,"example, sends her to the far West; a third united the two and told of"
6539,III.,the Flight of Circe upon the chariot of the Sun from Orient to
6540,III.,"Occident, which is doubtless a much later form of the tale, though"
6541,III.,"ascribed to Hesiod. Circe is of a higher ancestry than Polyphemus,"
6542,III.,"though both go back in origin to the sea with their island homes; she,"
6543,III.,"however, is a child of the light-giving body, and will show her descent"
6544,III.,"in the end. Her name is related to the circle, and hints the circling"
6545,III.,"luminary, on whose car she is said to have fled once. Here in Homer,"
6546,III.,"however, we may note an inner circle of development; she passes through"
6547,III.,"a round of experience, and seems to complete a period of evolution. She"
6548,III.,"must be grasped as a movement, as a cycle of character, if you please;"
6549,III.,"she develops within, and this is the main fact of her portrayal."
6550,III.,
6551,III.,"The preceding etymological intimations are dim enough, yet they point"
6552,III.,"back to Asia, and to an old Aryan relationship. Not too much stress is"
6553,III.,"to be put upon them, yet they are entitled to their due recognition,"
6554,III.,"and are not to be thrown aside as absolutely meaningless. By Homer,"
6555,III.,"himself, they could not have been understood, being traces of a"
6556,III.,migration and ethnical kinship which had been in his time long
6557,III.,"forgotten, and which modern scholarship has resurrected through the"
6558,III.,comparative study of language.
6559,III.,
6560,III.,More important is the connection between Circe and the two preceding
6561,III.,"portions of this Book, Æolia and the Læstrigonians. We have just seen"
6562,III.,"how both Family and State cast Ulysses off, must cast him off, since he"
6563,III.,is without moral subordination. The inner self-control demanded by an
6564,III.,"institutional life he has not been able to reach, after the alienation"
6565,III.,produced by the Trojan War; the bag of winds given into his hand by
6566,III.,Æolus he could not keep tied. Why? Behold Circe rise up and take on
6567,III.,shape after his twofold experience. Really she is evolved out of
6568,III.,"Ulysses in a certain sense; he sees her just now and not before,"
6569,III.,because he has created her. Why is he thus repelled by Family and
6570,III.,State? Circe is the answer; she is the enchantress who stands for
6571,III.,sensuous pleasure in its most alluring form; with her is now the
6572,III.,battle.
6573,III.,
6574,III.,"Thus we approach another struggle of the hero, the longest and by far"
6575,III.,"the most elaborately unfolded, of the present Book. In many respects it"
6576,III.,is the counterpart of the story of Polyphemus in the previous Book.
6577,III.,There he meets and puts down the anti-institutional man; here he meets
6578,III.,and puts down the anti-moral woman. The one represents more the
6579,III.,"objective side of man's spirit, the other more the subjective; both"
6580,III.,"together image the totality of the ethical world, in its two supreme"
6581,III.,"aspects, institutions and morals."
6582,III.,
6583,III.,Very famous has this story of Circe become in literature. It has
6584,III.,"furnished proverbs, allusions, texts for exhortation; it has been"
6585,III.,"wrought over into almost every possible form--drama, novel, poem,"
6586,III.,paramyth; from the nursery to old age it retains its charm and power.
6587,III.,"Its meaning is plain enough, especially at first; but it grows more"
6588,III.,weird and more profound as it develops; at last it ascends quite into
6589,III.,the beyond and points to the supersensible world.
6590,III.,
6591,III.,"Now the main point to be seized in this tale is the movement, the"
6592,III.,"development of Circe through her several stages, which are in the main"
6593,III.,"three, showing Circe victorious, Circe conquered, and Circe prophetic."
6594,III.,"Ulysses and his companions move along with these stages, being also in"
6595,III.,"the process; but the center of interest, the complete unfolding, is"
6596,III.,found in Circe. These three chief stages we may give somewhat more
6597,III.,fully before entering upon the detailed exposition.
6598,III.,
6599,III.,_First._ The island is reached; some of the companions under a leader
6600,III.,"(not Ulysses) go to Circe's abode, and are turned into swine after"
6601,III.,partaking of her food. Circe triumphant.
6602,III.,
6603,III.,"_Second._ Ulysses himself then goes, having obtained the plant _moly_;"
6604,III.,"he subdues, enjoys; he releases his companions. He finally asks to be"
6605,III.,"sent home, according to the promise she had given. Circe subordinated."
6606,III.,
6607,III.,_Third._ Then she reveals her prophetic power and announces the future
6608,III.,"journey to Hades, ere he can return home. Thus she sends him on beyond"
6609,III.,"herself, and reaches her culmination in this Book."
6610,III.,
6611,III.,Of these three stages the last seems inappropriate to Circe's
6612,III.,"character, and is always a puzzle to the reader, till he probes to the"
6613,III.,"thought underlying the tale. Circe, then, is to show herself a seeress,"
6614,III.,and foreshadow the world beyond the present. Why just that in her case?
6615,III.,"But before the question can be answered, we must unfold the first two"
6616,III.,stages.
6617,III.,
6618,III.,"I. After an introduction which names the new island and its occupant,"
6619,III.,"as well as gives a bit of her genealogy, the tale takes up Ulysses and"
6620,III.,"his companions. After a rest of two days and two nights, the hero goes"
6621,III.,"forth to spy out the land, ascends a hill whence he sees the smoke of"
6622,III.,"Circe's palace rising ""through the bushes and the trees."" His last"
6623,III.,"experience makes him careful, his thirst for knowledge does not now"
6624,III.,drive him to go at once into her presence. He returns to his companions
6625,III.,"with his information, and on the way back he kills a high-horned stag,"
6626,III.,"""which had come down from the woods to the stream to slake its thirst."""
6627,III.,"The result is a good meal for all once more, and a restoration of hope."
6628,III.,
6629,III.,"1. In such a mood he imparts his discovery: ""I have seen with mine eyes"
6630,III.,"smoke in the center of the island."" Terror-striking was the"
6631,III.,"announcement to his companions, who at once thought of ""the cannibals,"
6632,III.,"Cyclops and Læstrigonians."" And they had cause for fear. It may,"
6633,III.,"however, be said in advance that Circe is not a man-eater, but a"
6634,III.,"man-transformer; she is a new phase of the great experience, she"
6635,III.,"bestializes; she is negative, not so much from without as from within,"
6636,III.,not consuming the human shape but transmuting it into that of an
6637,III.,animal.
6638,III.,
6639,III.,"A curious expression here needs some explanation. ""We know not where is"
6640,III.,"east and where is west, not where the Sun goes under the earth, nor"
6641,III.,"where he rises."" Why not? There have been several ways of viewing this"
6642,III.,"passage. Ulysses did not know the countries where the Sun set or rose,"
6643,III.,though he must have seen the direction. A statement from Voss may be
6644,III.,"here translated: ""The side of night and of day he knew well, for he saw"
6645,III.,sunrise and sunset; but he does not know into what region of the world
6646,III.,"he has wandered away from home."" One other suggestion: it may have been"
6647,III.,"very foggy or cloudy weather at the time. The internal hint, however,"
6648,III.,"is clear; he is astray, lost; he knows not what direction to take for"
6649,III.,his return.
6650,III.,
6651,III.,But something has to be done. Accordingly Ulysses divides his crew into
6652,III.,"two portions, one commanded by Eurylochus, the other by himself. The"
6653,III.,lot decided that Eurylochus and his company should go to the house of
6654,III.,"Circe, and the lot always decides aright in the hand of Ulysses. Forth"
6655,III.,"they ""go wailing, two and twenty companions, and leave us behind,"
6656,III.,"weeping."" A tearful time for those forty-four people plus the two"
6657,III.,leaders; which numbers give a basis for calculating the size of the
6658,III.,"crew, of which six had been already destroyed by the Ciconians and six"
6659,III.,by the Cyclops.
6660,III.,
6661,III.,"2. Soon they reach the abode of Circe, whose picture is now drawn with"
6662,III.,"characteristic touches. She is beautiful, sings with a beautiful voice,"
6663,III.,"and makes beautiful things, weaving webs such as the Goddesses weave."
6664,III.,"Surely an artistic being; her palace is built of hewn stone, not of"
6665,III.,"natural rock, yet it lies in the depths of the forest. Here again she"
6666,III.,"shows her power: wild animals, wolves and lions, lie around--fawning"
6667,III.,"upon, not attacking men, tamed by her powerful drugs. That is, she"
6668,III.,"shows herself the mistress of nature, or rather the transformer"
6669,III.,thereof; her mighty spell can change character and shape.
6670,III.,
6671,III.,There has been a difference of opinion from antiquity down to the
6672,III.,"present about these animals. Are they transformed men, or merely wild"
6673,III.,animals tamed? The matter is left in doubt by the poet and either view
6674,III.,"will answer for the passage. The connection, however, with the"
6675,III.,"transformation of the companions of Ulysses, would suggest the first"
6676,III.,"meaning. These partake of her food, with which she mingles her drug,"
6677,III.,"""in order that they might wholly forget their native country."" But here"
6678,III.,is something more than the indifference of the Lotus-eaters; these
6679,III.,"eaters and drinkers at once become swine as to ""their heads, voices and"
6680,III.,"hair,"" and eat the acorn and the fruit of cornel-tree, ""like wallowing"
6681,III.,"pigs."" Yet their mind remained ""firm as before."""
6682,III.,
6683,III.,There can be no doubt that Time has interpreted this scene in but one
6684,III.,"way, and Time is probably correct. Still it is not here expressly said"
6685,III.,"that the companions indulged to excess in food and drink, though they"
6686,III.,"apparently had just had a sufficiency of feasting along the sea-shore,"
6687,III.,"on venison and wine, ""unspeakable meat and sweet drink."" We must,"
6688,III.,"however, consider the whole to be a phase of that same lack of inner"
6689,III.,subordination which led these people to untie the fatal bag of winds
6690,III.,upon a former occasion.
6691,III.,
6692,III.,"3. One man alone escaped to tell the story, as so often happens in such"
6693,III.,"adventures; it is Eurylochus, ""who remained outside the palace"
6694,III.,"suspecting guile."" When Ulysses hears the account, he proposes to go at"
6695,III.,once and release his comrades. Eurylochus beseeches him not to attempt
6696,III.,"it, but he persists, saying, ""I shall go, a strong necessity is upon"
6697,III.,"me."" Possibly in his contemptuous expression, ""You stay in this place"
6698,III.,"eating and drinking,"" is hinted just that which he is now to put down,"
6699,III.,in contrast with his companions. Eurylochus is the man who is unable to
6700,III.,"solve the problem; he runs away from it, is afraid of it, and leaves"
6701,III.,his wretched associates behind. But the problem must have a positive
6702,III.,"solution, which here follows."
6703,III.,
6704,III.,II. We are now to witness the dealings of Ulysses with Circe; he is to
6705,III.,"subordinate her, making her into a means, not an end; she will"
6706,III.,"recognize him and submit completely, taking an oath not to do him any"
6707,III.,harm; she will release his companions and restore them to their natural
6708,III.,"forms at his behest; she will then properly entertain the entire crew,"
6709,III.,no longer turning them into swine. The world of the appetites and the
6710,III.,senses will be duly ordered and subjected to the rational; from an
6711,III.,imperious enchantress Ulysses changes Circe into an instrument of life
6712,III.,"and restoration. He is the transformer of her, not she of him; for she"
6713,III.,"will reduce man to a beast, unless he reduces her to reason."
6714,III.,
6715,III.,1. Ulysses on his way to Circe's palace is met by a seeming youth
6716,III.,"(really a God, Mercury) who warns him and gives him a plant potent"
6717,III.,against the drugs of the enchantress. It is manifest that Ulysses has a
6718,III.,"divine call; he knows already his problem from Eurylochus, the God"
6719,III.,reiterates it and inspires him with courage. In addition he receives a
6720,III.,"plant from the divine hand, whereof the description we may ponder: ""The"
6721,III.,"root is black, its flower white as milk; the Gods call it _moly_, hard"
6722,III.,"it is for men to dig up."" Very hard indeed! And the whole account is"
6723,III.,"symbolical, we think, consciously symbolical; it has an Orphic tinge,"
6724,III.,hinting of mystic rites. At any rate the hero has now the divine
6725,III.,"antidote; still he is to exert himself with all his valor; ""when she"
6726,III.,"shall smite thee with her staff, draw thy sword and rush upon her, as"
6727,III.,"if intending to kill her."" Thus he is to assert the god-like element in"
6728,III.,"himself, the rational, and subject to it the sensuous. It is clear that"
6729,III.,Ulysses is beginning to master the lesson of his experience.
6730,III.,
6731,III.,"2. He does as the God (and his own valor) directed, and Circe cowers"
6732,III.,"down subdued. She is not supreme, there is something higher and she"
6733,III.,"knows it. At once she recognizes who it is: ""Art thou that wily Ulysses"
6734,III.,whose coming hither from Troy in his black ship has often been foretold
6735,III.,"to me?"" Such a prophecy she must have known and felt, she had mind and"
6736,III.,"was aware of a power above her, which would some day put her down,"
6737,III.,"after the Trojan time. In like manner Polyphemus, the man of nature,"
6738,III.,"has heard of a coming conqueror, and actually named him."
6739,III.,
6740,III.,"This one kind of subjection, however, is not enough, it must be made"
6741,III.,"universal. Every kind of subordination of the sensuous, not merely in"
6742,III.,"the matter of eating and drinking, is necessary. The next thing to be"
6743,III.,"guarded against is carnal indulgence, which may ""make me cowardly and"
6744,III.,"unmanly."" Hence Circe has ""to swear the great oath, not to plot against"
6745,III.,"me any harm."" Thus in the two chief forms of human appetite, that of"
6746,III.,"eating and drinking and that of sexual indulgence, she is subjected."
6747,III.,
6748,III.,"Ulysses is beginning to have some claims to being a moral hero, still"
6749,III.,he is not by any means an ascetic. He has the Greek notion of morality;
6750,III.,"we have a right to enjoy, but enjoyment must not make us bestial;"
6751,III.,"rational moderation is the law. He drinks of Circe's cup, but does not"
6752,III.,"let it turn him into a swine; he shares in all her pleasures, but never"
6753,III.,suffers his head to get dizzy with her blandishments. Every seductive
6754,III.,"delicacy she sets before him, mingled with the most charming flattery;"
6755,III.,"""I did not like the feast."" Why? This leads us to the next and higher"
6756,III.,point.
6757,III.,
6758,III.,"3. Lofty is the response of Ulysses: ""O Circe, what right-minded man"
6759,III.,would endure to touch food and drink before seeing his companions
6760,III.,"released?"" At once she goes to the sty and sets them free, restoring"
6761,III.,"their shapes, ""and they became younger, larger, and more beautiful than"
6762,III.,"they were before."" A great advantage is this to any man; it is worth"
6763,III.,"the hard experience to come out with such a gain, especially as the"
6764,III.,"companions must have been getting a little old, stooped and wrinkled,"
6765,III.,having gone through so many years of hardship at Troy and on the sea.
6766,III.,
6767,III.,4. Thus Ulysses has transformed Circe into an instrument for restoring
6768,III.,his fallen comrades; surely a noble act. Next she of her own accord
6769,III.,asks Ulysses to go to the sea-shore for the rest of his men and to
6770,III.,bring them to her palace for refreshment and entertainment. This he
6771,III.,"succeeds in doing after some opposition from the terrified Eurylochus,"
6772,III.,who has not yet gotten over his scare. Sorely did the companions need
6773,III.,this rest and recuperation after their many sufferings on land and sea;
6774,III.,"""weak and spiritless they were, always thinking of the bitter"
6775,III.,"wandering."" But now in the palace of Circe ""they feasted every day for"
6776,III.,"a whole year,"" eating and drinking without being turned into swine."
6777,III.,"Even Eurylochus follows after, ""for he feared my terrible threat."""
6778,III.,
6779,III.,Thus we catch the sweep of this grand experience of and with Circe; if
6780,III.,"she governs, she bestializes man; if she serves, she refreshes and"
6781,III.,restores. Her complete subordination is witnessed; from transforming
6782,III.,"people into swine, she is herself transformed into their helper, and"
6783,III.,she becomes an important factor in the great Return to home and
6784,III.,country. But it is time to think of this Return again; the period of
6785,III.,repose and enjoyment must come to an end.
6786,III.,
6787,III.,"III. Here, then, we behold a new phase of Circe, that of the seeress"
6788,III.,"into the Beyond. Ulysses says to her at the end of the year: ""Now make"
6789,III.,"your promise good, send us home, for which we long."" Stunning is the"
6790,III.,"answer after that period of relaxation: ""Ye must go another way, ye"
6791,III.,"must pass into the Houses of Hades."" It is indeed a terrible response."
6792,III.,"But for what purpose? ""To consult the soul of the blind Theban seer"
6793,III.,"Tiresias, whose mind is still unimpaired; to him alone of the dead"
6794,III.,"Proserpine gave a mind to know."" Clearly this means the pure"
6795,III.,intelligence without body; Ulysses must now reach forth to the
6796,III.,"incorporeal spirit, to the very Idea beyond the senses, beyond life."
6797,III.,
6798,III.,"The first question which arises in this connection is, How can Circe,"
6799,III.,"the enchantress of the senses, be made the prophetess of the"
6800,III.,supersensible world? If we watch her development through the two
6801,III.,"preceding stages, we shall see that she not only can, but must point to"
6802,III.,"what is beyond, to spirit. In the second stage she experiences a great"
6803,III.,"change, no longer transforming into the lower, but herself transformed"
6804,III.,"into the higher; she becomes a moral being, subordinating the sensuous"
6805,III.,"to the spiritual; she has, therefore, spirit in her life and manifests"
6806,III.,"it in her actions, when she is the willing means of subjecting appetite"
6807,III.,to reason.
6808,III.,
6809,III.,"The same transformation we may note on her artistic side, for she"
6810,III.,remains always beautiful. The first Circe is that alluring seductive
6811,III.,beauty which destroys by catering to the senses; she is that kind of
6812,III.,"art, which debauches through its appeal to appetite and passion alone."
6813,III.,"But the second Circe is transfigured, her service is of the spirit, she"
6814,III.,"releases from the bondage of indulgence, she aids the ethical Return to"
6815,III.,"Family and State. It is true that she never becomes a saint or a nun,"
6816,III.,"she would not be Greek if she did; moreover, according to the Greek"
6817,III.,"view, she must be transcended by the typical man, who is to rise into"
6818,III.,"an institutional life, which is hardly Circe's. Still the primal moral"
6819,III.,subjection is shown in her career.
6820,III.,
6821,III.,"The domain of morals reveals the spiritual in action, the domain of"
6822,III.,true art reveals the spiritual in representation. What shall I do with
6823,III.,"this world of the senses? was a great question to the Greek, and still"
6824,III.,is to us. In conduct subordinate it; in nature transform it into an
6825,III.,image of the higher. The work of art is a divine flash from above into
6826,III.,"a sensuous form; this flash we separate from its material, and pass"
6827,III.,"into pure spirit; then we reach Tiresias, the mind embodied, not"
6828,III.,limited in Space and Time.
6829,III.,
6830,III.,"Circe thus indicates her own limitation, which belongs to morals and"
6831,III.,"art. She is not the Infinite, but can point to it; she hints the rise"
6832,III.,from art to philosophy. Backwards and forwards runs the suggestion in
6833,III.,her career; the Greek can lapse to the first Circe and die in a debauch
6834,III.,"of the senses, or he can rise to the prophetic Circe, and lay the deep"
6835,III.,"foundation of all future thought. The Greek world, in fact, had just"
6836,III.,this double outcome.
6837,III.,
6838,III.,"Ulysses, then, has to go to Hades, the supersensible realm; his heart"
6839,III.,"was wrung, ""I wept sitting upon the couch, I wished no longer to live"
6840,III.,"nor to see the light of the sun."" But after such a fit, he is ready for"
6841,III.,"action: ""when I had enough of weeping and rolling about, I asked Circe:"
6842,III.,"Who will guide me?"" Then he receives his instructions, which have"
6843,III.,"somewhat of the character of a mystic ritual, with offerings to the"
6844,III.,"dead, who will come and speak. Messages from the spirit world he will"
6845,III.,"get, but he must pass through the Ocean stream, to the groves of"
6846,III.,"Proserpine. From that point, after mooring his ship, he is to go to the"
6847,III.,"houses of Hades, where is a rock at the meeting of two loud-roaring"
6848,III.,"rivers; ""pour there a libation to the dead"" with due ceremony. In all"
6849,III.,"of which is the method of the later necromancy, or consultation of the"
6850,III.,departed for prophetic purposes. Very old is the faith that the souls
6851,III.,"of deceased persons can be made to appear and to foretell the future,"
6852,III.,after a proper rite and invocation; nor is such a belief unknown in our
6853,III.,day.
6854,III.,
6855,III.,Ulysses departs from Circe's palace and tells his companions concerning
6856,III.,the new voyage: whereat another scene of lamentation. To the Greek the
6857,III.,Underworld was a place of gloom and terror; he liked not the spirit
6858,III.,"disembodied, he needed the sensuous form for his thought, he was an"
6859,III.,artist by nature. The Homeric Greek in particular was the incarnation
6860,III.,"of the sunny Upperworld, he shuddered at the idea of separating from it"
6861,III.,"and its fair shapes. But the thing must be done, as it lies in the path"
6862,III.,of development as well as in the movement of this poem.
6863,III.,
6864,III.,"Ulysses must therefore go below, inasmuch as this world with its moral"
6865,III.,"life even, is not the finality. There is aught beyond, the limit of"
6866,III.,death we must surmount in the present existence still; a glimpse of
6867,III.,futurity the mortal must have before going thither. So Homer makes the
6868,III.,"Hero transcend life as it were, during life; and extend his wanderings"
6869,III.,into the supersensible world.
6870,III.,
6871,III.,The reader has now witnessed the three stages of this Tenth
6872,III.,"Book--Æolus, the Læstrigonians, and Circe. The inner connection between"
6873,III.,these three stages has also been investigated and brought to the
6874,III.,surface; at least such has been the persistent attempt. Especially has
6875,III.,Circe been unfolded in the different phases which she shows--all of
6876,III.,which have been traced back to a unity of character.
6877,III.,
6878,III.,The intimate relation between the Ninth and Tenth Books has been set
6879,III.,forth along with their differences. Both belong to the Upperworld of
6880,III.,"this Fableland; hence they stand in contrast with the Netherworld,"
6881,III.,which is now to follow.

6886,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,_BOOK ELEVENTH._
6887,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,
6888,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,
6889,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,The present Book is one of the most influential pieces of writing which
6890,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,man has produced. It has come down through the ages with a marvelous
6891,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,power of reproduction; in many ways poets have sought to create it
6892,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"over; indeed Time has imitated it in a series of fresh shapes. Virgil,"
6893,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"not to speak of other attempts in ancient Greek epics, has re-written"
6894,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,it in the Sixth Book of the Æneid; from Virgil it passed to Dante who
6895,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,has made its thought the mould which shapes his entire poem--the
6896,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,_Divine Comedy_.
6897,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,
6898,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"It is one phase of the great Mythus of the Apocalypse, or the"
6899,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"uncovering of the Future State, which in some form belongs to all"
6900,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"peoples, and which springs from the very nature of human spirit. Man"
6901,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"must know the Beyond; especially the Hero, the spiritual Hero of his"
6902,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"race, must extend his adventures, not only over the world, but into the"
6903,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"other world, and bring back thence the news concerning those who have"
6904,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,already departed.
6905,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,
6906,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"This then is the supreme Return of the Hero, the Return from beyond"
6907,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"life, still alive; he is to conquer not only the monster Polyphemus and"
6908,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"the enchantress Circe, but also the greatest goblin of all, Death."
6909,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,Common mortals have to make the passage thither without returning; the
6910,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"Hero must be the grand exception, else he were no Hero. Transcendent"
6911,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"must he be, rising above all limits, even the limit of life and death."
6912,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,
6913,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"We have, therefore, in the present Book the Greek glance into"
6914,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"immortality. This is the essence of it, hence its prodigious hold upon"
6915,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,human kind. That the conscious individual persists after the
6916,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,dissolution of the physical body is here strongly affirmed; indeed the
6917,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"world beyond is organized, and its connection with the world on this"
6918,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"side is unfolded, in a series of striking pictures for the imagination."
6919,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,It is thus a grand chapter in the history of the soul's consciousness
6920,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"of its eternal portion, is in fact the middle link between the Oriental"
6921,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,and the Christian view of immortality.
6922,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,
6923,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"Ulysses, as the wise man, or rather as the intellectual Hero of his"
6924,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"age, must go through the experience in question; he cannot return to"
6925,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"home and country, and be fully reconciled with his institutional life"
6926,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"here and now, without having seen what is eternal and abiding in the"
6927,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"soul. The wanderer must wander thither, the absolute necessity lies"
6928,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"upon him--and he must fetch back word about what he saw, and thus be a"
6929,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"mediator between the sensible and supersensible, between time and"
6930,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"eternity. In that way he means something to his people, becomes, in"
6931,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"fact, their Great Man, helping them vicariously in this life to rise"
6932,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"beyond life. The complete Return, then, involves the descending to"
6933,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"Hades, the beholding the shapes there, and the coming back with the"
6934,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,report to the living. Perhaps we ought to consider just this to be the
6935,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"culmination of the whole journey, the grand adventure embracing all"
6936,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,possible adventures.
6937,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,
6938,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,The connection with the preceding Book can not be too strongly
6939,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,enforced. Circe points out the way to Ulysses; her nature is to point
6940,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"to the Beyond, to which she cannot herself pass. In her last phase, she"
6941,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"was spirit, but still in the sensuous form; that spirit in her, as in"
6942,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"all true art and even in the world, points to its pure realm, where it"
6943,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,is freed from the trammels of the senses. This gives the main
6944,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"characteristic of Homeric Hades; it is the supersensible world, outside"
6945,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"of Space and Time; or, rather with its own Space and Time, since it is"
6946,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,still an image.
6947,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,
6948,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,Hence these mythical statements which seek to get beyond all known
6949,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"geographical limits. Ulysses had to cross the Ocean stream, which ran"
6950,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,round the whole earth; to go over it was indeed to go over the border.
6951,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"There below is the gloomy grove of Proserpine; there too, are the four"
6952,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"rivers of the Lower Regions, with names terribly suggestive; into"
6953,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,Acheron the stream of pain (or lake) flow Pyriphlegethon (Fire-flames)
6954,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"and Cocytus (the Howler), the latter being an offshoot of Styx (Hate or"
6955,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"Terror). Where ""the two loud-sounding rivers meet"" the third one"
6956,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"(Acheron) is a rock, a firm protected spot seemingly, there with mystic"
6957,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,rites is the invocation of the dead to take place.
6958,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,
6959,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,Thus we see that the poet's description remains spatial in his attempt
6960,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,to get beyond space. He has to express himself in images taken from the
6961,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"sensible world, even while pushing them beyond into the supersensible."
6962,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"He makes us feel that the image is inadequate, though he has to use it;"
6963,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,poetry is driven upon its very limit. At this point specially we note
6964,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"the kinship of the Odyssey with Romantic Art, which through the finite"
6965,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"form suggests the Infinite. Dante comes to mind, whose great poem is"
6966,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,one vast struggle of the limited symbol with the unlimited spirit which
6967,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"is symbolized. Thus the old Greek song becomes prophetic, foreshadowing"
6968,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"the next great world-poem, or Literary Bible, written in the light of a"
6969,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,new epoch.
6970,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,
6971,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,Strong is the sympathy which one feels with the ancient singer in this
6972,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,attempt to probe the deepest mystery of our existence. He must have
6973,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"reflected long and profoundly upon such a theme, building in this Book"
6974,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"a world of spirits, and laying down the lines of it for all futurity."
6975,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,Probably the most gigantic conception in literature: the universal
6976,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"Hero, ere he can round the complete cycle of experience, must pass"
6977,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,through the Beyond and come back to the Present. It deepens the idea of
6978,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"the Return, till it embraces the totality of existence, by making it"
6979,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"reach through the Underworld, which is thus a domain in the spiritual"
6980,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,circumnavigation of the globe.
6981,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,
6982,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,The structure of the Book is somewhat intricate and it requires quite a
6983,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,little search to find the lines upon which it is built. It has at the
6984,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"first glance a rather scattered, disorganized look; for this reason the"
6985,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"analytic critics have fallen upon it in particular, and have sought to"
6986,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,tear it into fragments. It is possible that some few lines may have
6987,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"been interpolated, but it remains an organic whole, and the final"
6988,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,insight into it comes from viewing it in its total constructive
6989,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,movement.
6990,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,
6991,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,As the Book is an effort to make a bridge between the sensible and
6992,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"supersensible realms, manifestly this separation into two realms will"
6993,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"constitute the fundamental division. The diremption into soul and body,"
6994,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"into life and death, runs through the entire narrative, also that into"
6995,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,men and women; but the main distinction is into Past and Present. The
6996,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"sensible world when canceled becomes Past, the distant in Time and"
6997,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"possibly in Space; this Past through its characters, its spirits, is"
6998,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,made to communicate with the Present.
6999,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,
7000,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,Moreover the Past has its distinctions. To the Greek mind of Homer's
7001,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"age, specially in Phæacia, the Trojan War is the grand central fact of"
7002,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"the aforetime; thus the Past divides into the Pre-Trojan, Trojan, and"
7003,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"immediate Past, in the Book before us. A complete sweep down into the"
7004,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,Now is given--the sweep of the supersensible. Also the Present has two
7005,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"representatives: Ulysses along with his companions, and the Phæacians."
7006,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,
7007,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"In the Past, therefore, is arranged a long gallery of souls speaking to"
7008,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"the Present, which listens and also has its communication. The problem"
7009,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,now is to get a structural form which will hold the idea. Let the
7010,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"following scheme be sent in advance, which scheme, however, can only be"
7011,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,verified or understood at the close of the Book on a careful review.
7012,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,
7013,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,I. The first great communication of the dead and past to the living and
7014,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"present, by voice and by vision; some speak, others are only seen."
7015,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,
7016,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,1. The present and living element is made up of Ulysses and his
7017,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,companions who are invoking by their rites and prayers the souls of the
7018,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"Underworld. The companion Elpenor dead, but not yet buried, forms the"
7019,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,transition between the Present and Past.
7020,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,
7021,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"2. The past and dead element, Pre-Trojan, is called up in two general"
7022,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,forms: the ancient seer Tiresias who is both Past and Future through
7023,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"his mind, and, secondly, the souls of Famous Women, who pass in review"
7024,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,before the Present. The hint of a world-justice runs through both the
7025,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,prophecies of the seer and the destinies of some of these women.
7026,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,
7027,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"II. The second grand communication of the dead and past, now Trojan--to"
7028,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"the living and present, now Phæacian prominently, given by voice and"
7029,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,vision.
7030,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,
7031,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"1. The Present is here not only Ulysses far off in Hades, but the"
7032,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,Phæacians in their actual sensible world. The latter demand again the
7033,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,grand background and presupposition of their present life--the Trojan
7034,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,epoch represented in its great spirits.
7035,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,
7036,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"2. The Past, Trojan, in three typical Greek heroes, Agamemnon,"
7037,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"Achilles, Ajax. The three typical Greek women of the Trojan epoch are"
7038,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"also mentioned. An implicit idea of punishment, or of heroic limitation"
7039,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"brought home to the hero, is traceable in this portion."
7040,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,
7041,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"III. The idea of a world-justice with its universal judgment, hitherto"
7042,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"only implied, now becomes explicit in Hades and organizes itself,"
7043,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"showing (1) the judge, Minos, (2) the culprits in four condemned ones,"
7044,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"(3) the saved one, Hercules, who rises out of Hades through the deed."
7045,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,By implication so does the living Ulysses--hence the journey is at an
7046,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,"end, Hades is conquered."
7047,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,
7048,_BOOK ELEVENTH._,
7049,I.,I.
7050,I.,
7051,I.,"Ulysses follows the direction of Circe, indeed he is propelled by the"
7052,I.,"wind which she sends, to the ""confines of the Ocean stream,"" to the"
7053,I.,limits of this terrestrial Upperworld. Here is the land of the
7054,I.,"Cimmerians, ""hid in fog and in cloud,"" which veils the realm of the"
7055,I.,"dead; here the sun sends no beam, either rising or setting. Again it is"
7056,I.,possible that the poet may have heard some dim account of the regions
7057,I.,of the extreme North. But the significance of the Cimmerians is to
7058,I.,"shadow forth the dark border-land between life and death, which is here"
7059,I.,that between the limited and the unlimited. We see the strong attempt
7060,I.,of the poet to get beyond limitation in its twofold appearance: first
7061,I.,"he will transcend the external boundary of the Homeric horizon, that of"
7062,I.,the sea stretching far to the westward; still more emphatic is his
7063,I.,effort to transcend the limits of finite thinking and to reach an
7064,I.,"infinite realm, which is the goal of the spirit. He sweeps out of"
7065,I.,"sensuous space, yet the poetic imagination has to remain in space after"
7066,I.,"all, though it be a new space of its own creation. In like manner, he"
7067,I.,has to give the disembodied souls some finite nourishment in the shape
7068,I.,"of food and blood, in order that they become real. We feel in these"
7069,I.,dark Cimmerian limits his wrestle to pass over to the supersensible by
7070,I.,thought.
7071,I.,
7072,I.,"I. The Present is represented by Ulysses and his companions, who now"
7073,I.,"perform the rites consisting of a sacrifice and prayer to ""the nations"
7074,I.,"of the dead."" We may find in the libation of ""mingled honey, sweet"
7075,I.,"wine, and water,"" a suggestion of the tissues and fluids of the body,"
7076,I.,while the blood of the sacrificed animals hints the principle of
7077,I.,"vitality. When the disembodied spirit tastes these elements, it gets a"
7078,I.,"kind of body again, sufficient at least to be able to speak. That the"
7079,I.,"sheep must be black is curiously symbolical, hinting the harmony"
7080,I.,expressed in the color of the animal and of Hades.
7081,I.,
7082,I.,"The souls ""came thronging out of Erebus,"" eager to communicate. This"
7083,I.,aspiration must thus be their general condition; they wish to hear from
7084,I.,us as much as we wish to hear from them. Hence there must be a
7085,I.,"selection, which involves a new rite, the flaying and the burning of"
7086,I.,"the carcasses of the animals along with ""prayer to Pluto and"
7087,I.,"Proserpine"" king and queen of the Underworld. Yet this choice requires"
7088,I.,"activity from the hero, who has to draw his sword and keep off the"
7089,I.,"crowd of spirits, till the right one comes, the Theban seer Tiresias."
7090,I.,
7091,I.,"Thus is the Past linked into the Present, which to receive the"
7092,I.,"communications of the departed by means of a ritual, in whose symbolism"
7093,I.,we see the effort of the living to know the Beyond. Now occurs a
7094,I.,"curious incident: Ulysses beholds his companion Elpenor, dead, yet"
7095,I.,"unburned, and hears his first message. This soul can still speak, and"
7096,I.,"be seen; it hovers half way between the two worlds, having still a"
7097,I.,material phase of the body which has not yet been burnt. Elpenor tells
7098,I.,"the nature of his death: ""some deity and too much wine"" did the"
7099,I.,thing--a combination which is usually effective in Homer. An unhappy
7100,I.,"condition, suspended between matter and spirit; he begs that it be"
7101,I.,ended. But the poor fellow has another request which shows the longing
7102,I.,"of the humblest Greek--the longing for the immortality of fame. ""Make a"
7103,I.,"tomb beside the seashore for me, an unfortunate man, of whom posterity"
7104,I.,"may hear."" Thus he too will live in the mouths of men; wherein we catch"
7105,I.,"possibly a gleam of Homer himself, who has certainly erected an"
7106,I.,"imperishable monument to Elpenor, voicing the aspiration of the soul"
7107,I.,even in Hades.
7108,I.,
7109,I.,"It is the hint of a deep maternal instinct that Anticleia, ""my mother"
7110,I.,"deceased"" comes at once to the blood and wishes communication. But"
7111,I.,"Ulysses must first hear Tiresias, the strongest ties of Family are"
7112,I.,subordinate to the great purpose. Surely all are now ready to listen to
7113,I.,"the Past with its message; here comes its spirit, voiced with a fresh"
7114,I.,power.
7115,I.,
7116,I.,"II. We have just had the Present, and in the case of Elpenor, the"
7117,I.,"immediate Past, which is not yet wholly gone. Next we take a leap to"
7118,I.,"the Past of long ago, to the Pre-Trojan time, whose spirits will"
7119,I.,"appear. Two sets of them, divided according to sex into man and woman,"
7120,I.,"we behold. But the man here is the prophet, hence what he says belongs"
7121,I.,"to the Future, into which Ulysses now gets a glimpse."
7122,I.,
7123,I.,Thus both Future and Past are given their place in the supersensible
7124,I.,"realm, both being abstractions from the Present, which is the reality,"
7125,I.,the world of the senses. Yet that which is abiding and eternal knows
7126,I.,"not Past, Present, or Future, or knows them all equally, having that"
7127,I.,"which is common to them all, being indeed the principle of them all. In"
7128,I.,"a sense we may say that Tiresias is Past, Present and Future, he is the"
7129,I.,voice of the Past speaking in the Present foretelling the Future. Then
7130,I.,"the Famous Women come forth, whose fame causes them to appear now and"
7131,I.,to be recorded. Thus the poet takes the two ancient sets and suggests
7132,I.,that which underlies them both and makes them ever present.
7133,I.,
7134,I.,"1. Tiresias, though he spans the three dimensions of Time, is"
7135,I.,"essentially the prophet, and so his stress is upon the Future. His body"
7136,I.,"has been long dead, but his mind is left in its untrammeled activity;"
7137,I.,he may be considered as the purest essence of spirit. No senses
7138,I.,"obstruct his vision, he sees the eternal and unchangeable law; yet he"
7139,I.,must throw it into images and apply it to special cases. What a
7140,I.,conception for a primitive poet! We feel in this figure of Tiresias
7141,I.,"that Homer himself is prophetic, foreshadowing the pure ideas or"
7142,I.,"archetypal forms of Plato, and that he, in his struggle for adequate"
7143,I.,"expression of thought, is calling for, and in fact calling forth, Greek"
7144,I.,philosophy.
7145,I.,
7146,I.,"Tiresias speaks at first without drinking of the blood, yet he has to"
7147,I.,drink of it to tell his prophecy. This little contradiction is not
7148,I.,"vital, let it not trouble us. The prophetic announcement to Ulysses"
7149,I.,"includes four special cases. First, the Hero must have his struggle"
7150,I.,"with Neptune on his way homeward, the God will avenge the blinding of"
7151,I.,"his son, though that blinding had to take place; every man who"
7152,I.,"overcomes a great power, even a natural power, will get the backstroke"
7153,I.,"of his own deed. The very ship of Ulysses, which defies Neptune,"
7154,I.,"exposes itself to a conflict which it might avoid, did it not undertake"
7155,I.,to master the God's element; such is the penalty of all victory.
7156,I.,"Secondly, he must keep down appetite, particularly at the Trinacrian"
7157,I.,"Isle, and not slay the Oxen of the Sun, else the penalty will follow"
7158,I.,there too. Not to keep down passion and appetite is clearly to eat of
7159,I.,"those oxen in some way, which will be more carefully scrutinized"
7160,I.,"hereafter. Then, thirdly, ""thou shalt avenge the violent deeds of the"
7161,I.,"Suitors, when thou hast returned home."""
7162,I.,
7163,I.,The common ground in these three cases of prophetic insight is
7164,I.,retribution for the act done there above on earth. The penalty is as
7165,I.,certain in the future as it has been in the past; violation brings
7166,I.,"punishment. Ulysses has had that experience often; note it is told him,"
7167,I.,"or, if you wish to think the matter in that way, he tells it to himself"
7168,I.,"for his own future experience. So the Prophet sees the universal law,"
7169,I.,he knows what abides in all the fleeting appearances of the world.
7170,I.,"Ulysses also, were he to descend into the depths of his own soul, would"
7171,I.,find the same prophecy; indeed this descent into Hades is also the
7172,I.,"descent into himself, as well as into the outer supersensible world."
7173,I.,"The hero in his intellectual journey has gone far, we can now behold"
7174,I.,him near the eternal verities.
7175,I.,
7176,I.,"But the fourth statement of the Prophet is here too, it is the word of"
7177,I.,"promise. When this last conflict with the Suitors is over, then be"
7178,I.,reconciled with Neptune by a fitting sacrifice (which means that
7179,I.,Ulysses should quit the watery element) give hecatombs to the
7180,I.,"Immortals, recognize them and their rule. Then serene old age will take"
7181,I.,"thee off remote from the sea and all struggle, among a happy people,"
7182,I.,"whom thou hast made happy. Such is the promise, extending quite beyond"
7183,I.,"the limits of the Odyssey, which ends not at the death of Ulysses, but"
7184,I.,"with his last conflict. So there is hope amid all this struggle, hope"
7185,I.,"of becoming the complete man, who has reached harmony with the Gods,"
7186,I.,"with his people, and with himself."
7187,I.,
7188,I.,In such fashion Tiresias calls into vision the course of the entire
7189,I.,"poem, and reaches even beyond it, embracing the whole life of Ulysses,"
7190,I.,till he too descends for the last time into Hades. Verily the prophet
7191,I.,"is Past, Present and Future; his true abode is in the realm of pure"
7192,I.,"spirit. He foretells, but the Future is prefigured as the outcome of"
7193,I.,"what is universal; it must be so and not otherwise, else is the world a"
7194,I.,"chaos. Thus Tiresias is put at the beginning, he being the typical"
7195,I.,"person of this Underworld, in which the deities, Pluto and Proserpine,"
7196,I.,"do not appear, being held in the dark background. The prophet telling"
7197,I.,his prophecy is the very Figure of the Supersensible.
7198,I.,
7199,I.,But again let us be reminded that these hints of pure universal thought
7200,I.,"are borne to us in images, in particular shapes, whereby ambiguity"
7201,I.,"rises, and meaning runs double. Nevertheless the true-hearted reader"
7202,I.,"will go down with the old poet into Hades, and there behold in these"
7203,I.,images things which lie beyond the senses; he will behold the very
7204,I.,spirit of ancient Tiresias.
7205,I.,
7206,I.,"2. Having seen the Man, Ulysses is next to behold the Famous Women of"
7207,I.,"the Past, which is still Pre-Trojan with one exception. Examples from"
7208,I.,"all the relations of the woman in the Family are given: the mother, the"
7209,I.,"maiden, the wife. Tragic and happy instances are brought before"
7210,I.,"us--ideal forms taken from the ancient Mythus of Hellas, and begetting"
7211,I.,"in later times a prodigious number of works of art, in poetry,"
7212,I.,"sculpture and painting. Here they are put into Hades, the place of the"
7213,I.,"spirit unbodied, which will hereafter take on body in the drama, in the"
7214,I.,"statue, and in the picture. Ulysses witnesses these shapes in advance,"
7215,I.,"and gives their idea, which is to be realized in the coming ages of"
7216,I.,"Hellas. Truly is Homer the primordial Hellenic seer, he who sees and"
7217,I.,sets forth the archetypal forms of the future of his race. Undoubtedly
7218,I.,"he drew from mythical stores already existent, but he ordered them,"
7219,I.,"shaped them anew, and breathed into them the breath of eternal life. No"
7220,I.,wonder the universal Greek hero must go to Hades to see these forms of
7221,I.,"the Past which are, however, to live afresh in the Future."
7222,I.,
7223,I.,We must also consider the audience of the singer. Who are present?
7224,I.,"First of all, Arete, mother and wife, together with Nausicaa, the"
7225,I.,"maiden, to these he is specially singing. Their importance in the"
7226,I.,Phæacian world has been already indicated; naturally they wish to hear
7227,I.,"of woman in the Family. Accordingly this portion of the Eleventh Book,"
7228,I.,"the catalogue of Famous Women, or Homer's ""Legende of Good Women,"" is"
7229,I.,organized after the relations of domestic life. Three classes are
7230,I.,"suggested: the mothers; the maidens and the wives, of the grey"
7231,I.,aforetime.
7232,I.,
7233,I.,But by all means the glory and the stress of the song are given to the
7234,I.,"mothers; the other two classes are very briefly dismissed, as being"
7235,I.,essentially described in the first. Arete is indeed the grand center
7236,I.,"and end of womanhood; Nausicaa as maid is but a transitory phase, and"
7237,I.,"as wife she is to become mother, and then take her supreme place in the"
7238,I.,chain which upholds and perpetuates humanity. So the old Greek poet
7239,I.,must have thought; was he very far from right?
7240,I.,
7241,I.,"_a._ The first of these mothers to appear is Anticleia, the mother"
7242,I.,"of the Hero Ulysses, of the Hero who has made this remarkable"
7243,I.,"voyage to the world beyond, of its kind the supreme heroic act done"
7244,I.,"by a living mortal. She, however, belongs to the immediate Past,"
7245,I.,"and thus corresponds to the man, Elpenor, in the previous section,"
7246,I.,"though she of course has been buried. Note, therefore, this mark of"
7247,I.,symmetrical structure.
7248,I.,
7249,I.,"It is the beautiful instinct of the mother, that she flits in the"
7250,I.,"ghost-world to her son at once, when the chance is afforded. She"
7251,I.,"has already appeared, even before Tiresias came; now she is the"
7252,I.,"first after that prophet, who gives directions to Ulysses"
7253,I.,"supplicating: ""Tell me, O Prophet, how shall my mother recognize me"
7254,I.,"as her son."" Ulysses learns much from her about Ithaca, especially"
7255,I.,"about his father Laertes, who now never goes to the town but stays"
7256,I.,"in the fields, ""with a great sorrow in his heart, desiring thy"
7257,I.,"return, while old age weighs hard upon him."" Such is the father,"
7258,I.,"still living, whom Ulysses may yet see."
7259,I.,
7260,I.,"The mother died from longing for her son and ""the memory of his"
7261,I.,"gentleness;"" still her longing brings her to him in the life"
7262,I.,beyond. The great revelation is concerning the future state: the
7263,I.,"soul is immortal, this fact Ulysses is to tell in Phæacia. The"
7264,I.,strong desire to behold the loved ones who have passed away is
7265,I.,"indeed the impulse; but they too return, though insubstantial. It"
7266,I.,is the primary groundwork of faith in immortality--this feeling of
7267,I.,the domestic relation affirming that it is eternal and cannot be
7268,I.,broken by death. Still the mother is but a ghost and cannot be
7269,I.,"embraced; this the son has to accept, though he would have her in"
7270,I.,flesh and blood.
7271,I.,
7272,I.,_b._ At once there is the transition to the famous mothers of
7273,I.,"legend--""wives and daughters of Heroes"" says the poet, with, an eye"
7274,I.,"to his audience, which has men in it also, so he does not mention"
7275,I.,"mothers, though they are the burden of his strain. Here follows a"
7276,I.,"Catalogue of Women, giving them their due place in the genealogy"
7277,I.,and destiny of distinguished houses. Three groups of these mothers
7278,I.,we may distinguish.
7279,I.,
7280,I.,"First is the group of mortal women who were embraced by some god,"
7281,I.,and gave birth to heroic offspring. Tyro met Neptune and brought
7282,I.,forth Pelias and Neleus; from the latter sprang Nestor who connects
7283,I.,"the Pre-Trojan and Trojan ages, since he appears both in the Iliad"
7284,I.,and Odyssey. In the Third Book of the latter epos we have already
7285,I.,seen Nestor sacrificing to his divine ancestor; so the present
7286,I.,passage has its pertinence to the total poem. In the same group are
7287,I.,"Antiope and Alemena, the latter of whom was the mother of Hercules,"
7288,I.,"whose father was Zeus. At the end of the present Book, Hercules"
7289,I.,himself will appear as the supreme example of the Greek Hero.
7290,I.,
7291,I.,"Such were three typical mothers, famed in Hellenic legend, being"
7292,I.,"the women who bore Heroes, the offspring of Gods. It was deemed the"
7293,I.,"highest function of the Greek mother to bring forth a Hero, the"
7294,I.,"child of divinity, with an immortal portion. This view, in its"
7295,I.,"purely sensuous aspect, is dubious enough to the modern ethical"
7296,I.,"mind, still its real meaning must be looked at with sympathetic"
7297,I.,"vision, which sees therein the divine descent into mortal flesh, a"
7298,I.,mythical utterance of the faith that the great man is the son of
7299,I.,"God. The Christian view universalizes this conception, holding that"
7300,I.,"all men, and not merely the Heroes, are God's children. Yet the"
7301,I.,"Christian world has also retained its faith in the Son of God, son"
7302,I.,"by a mortal woman, which faith the old Greek had too, and expressed"
7303,I.,in his way. Thus we may extract out of this Homeric account
7304,I.,something more than divine license; it has indeed a wonderful
7305,I.,"pre-Christian suggestiveness, and gives a glimpse of the movement"
7306,I.,of Universal Religion.
7307,I.,
7308,I.,The second group of famous mothers are mortal women with mortal
7309,I.,"husbands. The wedded wife brings up now the domestic relation,"
7310,I.,"which is passingly introduced by the spouse of Hercules, Megara,"
7311,I.,who is simply mentioned. The two chief women of the group are
7312,I.,"Epicaste and Chloris, the one supremely tragic in her motherhood,"
7313,I.,"the other reasonably happy. Epicaste is mother of OEdipus, who"
7314,I.,"marries her after slaying his own father who is her husband, both"
7315,I.,deeds being done in ignorance; thus the closest domestic ties are
7316,I.,"whelmed into guilt and tragedy, whereof Sophocles has made a"
7317,I.,"world-famous use, in his two dramas on the subject of OEdipus."
7318,I.,"Chloris is, on the contrary, the mother of Nestor, not a tragic"
7319,I.,"character by any means; also she is mother of Pero, the beautiful"
7320,I.,"maiden, ""whom all the people around were wooing,"" and who was"
7321,I.,happily won by an heroic deed. Mark the interest of those
7322,I.,"listeners, Arete and Nausicaa, mother and daughter in this tale."
7323,I.,"Thus the two women, Epicaste and Chloris, have opposite destinies,"
7324,I.,and show the sharp contrasts of life.
7325,I.,
7326,I.,In the third group are two mothers who have a double honor; each
7327,I.,has borne twins and heroic ones at that; moreover the Gods again
7328,I.,"enter the domestic relation of mortals. Leda's sons are ""Castor the"
7329,I.,"horseman, and Pollux the boxer,"" the first being mortal, the second"
7330,I.,"immortal, and reputed son of Zeus, who permitted the immortal"
7331,I.,brother to share his immortality with his mortal brother; hence
7332,I.,"""every other day they both are alive, and every other day they both"
7333,I.,"are dead."" Again the divine gives itself to the human in the spirit"
7334,I.,of true brotherhood; the son of Zeus takes on the ills of mortality
7335,I.,through fraternal love. The second mother of this group is
7336,I.,"Iphidameia, who declares Neptune to be the father of Otus and"
7337,I.,"Ephialtes, of her monstrous twins, ""who at the age of nine years"
7338,I.,"threatened war upon the Gods,"" and proposed to storm heaven by"
7339,I.,piling Mount Ossa upon Olympus and Pelion on top of that. Such is
7340,I.,"the contrast: one set of sons is noble, worthy, and ""receive honor"
7341,I.,"like unto Gods;"" the other set is defiant, assailing the divine"
7342,I.,"order, and are slain by the arrows of Apollo ""ere the down"
7343,I.,"blossomed beneath their temples, and covered their chins with"
7344,I.,"tender furze."""
7345,I.,
7346,I.,"_c._ Such, then, is the account of the mothers, the women who have"
7347,I.,borne children famous in legend. They have taken up nearly the
7348,I.,whole of the present catalogue; the wives and maidens now come in
7349,I.,"for brief mention, forming two groups, three persons to the group."
7350,I.,"The poet is impartial, he introduces the faithful woman, Ariadne,"
7351,I.,"and the faithless woman, Eriphyle; in the one case man is the"
7352,I.,"betrayer of woman, and in the other case woman is the betrayer of"
7353,I.,"man. Possibly in Ariadne may be a little hint for Nausicaa, saying,"
7354,I.,Beware.
7355,I.,
7356,I.,But the singer is tired and sleepy; moreover has he not told the
7357,I.,essence of the matter in this portion of his song? He at once
7358,I.,"dismisses any further account of famous women, ""wives and daughters"
7359,I.,"of Heroes,"" whom he saw in Hades. Nausicaa and Arete have had their"
7360,I.,"share, wonderful has been their interest in the struggles and"
7361,I.,sufferings of their sex; they feel in themselves the possibility of
7362,I.,"such conflicts. These ideal shapes of the olden time, product of"
7363,I.,"the myth-making Imagination, are types, are the ghosts of Hades"
7364,I.,"which Ulysses must see and know, ere he return to the Upperworld."
7365,I.,
7366,I.,
7367,II.,II.
7368,II.,
7369,II.,"We now reach the second main division of the Book, which is marked by"
7370,II.,"the introduction of the audience, the Phæacians, ""who were held rapt"
7371,II.,"with the charm"" of the story. Observe, too, that the palace was not"
7372,II.,"brilliantly illuminated, but shadowy--fit environment for fairy tales"
7373,II.,(line 334). This main division is again separated into two subordinate
7374,II.,"divisions which embrace the Present and the Past, and thus is in"
7375,II.,structure homologous with the preceding main division. Yet both the
7376,II.,Present and the Past are not now the same as the previous Present and
7377,II.,Past.
7378,II.,
7379,II.,"I. First of the hearers speaks out the mother, wife of Alcinous, Arete,"
7380,II.,in response to the compliment of Ulysses in singing of the Famous Women
7381,II.,"of Greek legend. ""Phæacians, how does this man seem to you now in form,"
7382,II.,"stature, and mind?"" Very different does he seem from what he once did;"
7383,II.,thus she gently apologizes for her previous treatment. She appreciates
7384,II.,"the Hero; moreover, she asks that the high guest receive hospitable"
7385,II.,"gifts without stint; ""for much wealth lies in your halls by the bounty"
7386,II.,"of the Gods."""
7387,II.,
7388,II.,"Having thus heard from the woman, we now are to hear from the man, the"
7389,II.,"representative Phæacian, king Alcinous. In the first portion of the"
7390,II.,Book Ulysses and his companions were the Present to which the Past
7391,II.,"appeared in Hades. Now the Phæacians are introduced as the Present,"
7392,II.,"which is to hear the voice of the Past from Hades. Moreover, the Past"
7393,II.,"is not the Pre-Trojan, but the Trojan Past, which we have already (in"
7394,II.,the Eighth Book) seen to be dear to the Phæacian heart. It is no
7395,II.,"wonder, then, that Alcinous, as soon as he can urge his request, calls"
7396,II.,"for a song about the Greco-Trojan Heroes in the Underworld. ""Tell us if"
7397,II.,thou didst see any of those godlike Argives who followed thee to Troy
7398,II.,"and there met their fate."" Not the mother of the Hero, but the Hero"
7399,II.,himself is now to be called up; the man wishes to listen to the deeds
7400,II.,"of man. Demodocus, the Phæacian bard, always sung of some phase of the"
7401,II.,"Trojan struggle, which was the popular subject of story and song in"
7402,II.,"Phæacia. Thus we note again how the famous Past, stored away in Hades,"
7403,II.,"is made to flow into the Present, and to contribute an ideal of"
7404,II.,"heroism, and a warning also, to the living."
7405,II.,
7406,II.,"A touch of Homer as literary critic we should not pass by, as he does"
7407,II.,"not often take that part. Alcinous, praising the tale of Ulysses, says:"
7408,II.,"""Form of words is thine, and a noble meaning, and a mythus, as when a"
7409,II.,"minstrel sings."" Three important qualities of poetry are therein set"
7410,II.,"forth: beauty of language, nobleness of content, and the fable in its"
7411,II.,"totality--all of which belong to the preceding narrative. Moreover,"
7412,II.,"Alcinous draws a sharp contrast with that other sort of storytellers,"
7413,II.,"mere liars, ""of whom the dark earth feeds many,"" who go about"
7414,II.,"""fabricating lies, out of which we, looking into them, can get"
7415,II.,"nothing,"" can draw no meaning. Such at least is our view of this"
7416,II.,passage (line 366) about which there is a difference of opinion among
7417,II.,commentators. At any rate we catch a glimpse of Homeric literary
7418,II.,"criticism in Homer, who states the requirements of good poetry, and"
7419,II.,"contrasts them with the ""liar"" or fabricator of yarns, which are"
7420,II.,certainly devoid of the noble spirit or worthy content.
7421,II.,
7422,II.,"So Ulysses is asked to begin his Trojan story, always more interesting"
7423,II.,"than that catalogue of women, at which everybody began to yawn. ""It is"
7424,II.,"not yet time to go to sleep,"" cries Alcinous, ""the night here is"
7425,II.,"unspeakably long,"" and still further, ""I would hold out till daylight,"""
7426,II.,listening to thy story.
7427,II.,
7428,II.,"II. The Trojan Past, then, is the theme; we are to behold the ghosts of"
7429,II.,"those who were famous during the War at Troy, and immediately"
7430,II.,"afterwards, both men and women. But the women are not here given a"
7431,II.,"special portion to themselves, but are woven into the general"
7432,II.,"narrative. This part of the Book is sung for the men, the opposite sex"
7433,II.,"is withdrawn into the background; still they will be duly mentioned,"
7434,II.,since the whole conflict is over a woman. Moreover Alcinous wishes to
7435,II.,"hear what the heroic men are doing in the future world, whither too he"
7436,II.,must go.
7437,II.,
7438,II.,"1. Three Greek shades will pass before us, Agamemnon the Leader,"
7439,II.,"Achilles the Hero, and Ajax the man of strength. We shall find them"
7440,II.,"placed in a certain contrast with Ulysses, who is shown greater than"
7441,II.,any of the three. All have been overwhelmed by fate through their own
7442,II.,"folly or weakness, while Ulysses still lives, the master of fate, and"
7443,II.,"beholds them in Hades. Such is his triumph, which the shades themselves"
7444,II.,declare.
7445,II.,
7446,II.,"First comes the soul of Agamemnon, the great King, who has the bond of"
7447,II.,authority in common with King Alcinous. He tells the story of his own
7448,II.,"murder in considerable detail, which story has been given twice already"
7449,II.,in the poem. A most impressive event to the Greek mind of Homer's age;
7450,II.,the greatest of the rulers is wretchedly cut off from his Return by his
7451,II.,wife Clytæmnestra and her paramour Ægisthus. This Return is what points
7452,II.,the contrast between him and Ulysses; moreover the contrast is also
7453,II.,"drawn between the wives of the two men, one the faithless and the other"
7454,II.,the faithful woman. Still the wrong of Agamemnon is suggested by
7455,II.,"himself: ""I heard the piteous voice of Cassandra, whom Clytæmnestra"
7456,II.,"slew, crying for me; I, though dying, grasped for my sword,"" to no"
7457,II.,"purpose, however. Surely the wife had her wrongs as well as the"
7458,II.,"husband, out of which double guilt Æschylus will construct his mighty"
7459,II.,tragedy.
7460,II.,
7461,II.,"Next after the Leader, in due order comes the Hero of the Greeks before"
7462,II.,"Troy, Achilles. He recognizes this descent to Hades as the greatest"
7463,II.,"deed of Ulysses: ""What greater deed, rash man, wilt thou plan next?"" It"
7464,II.,"is verily the most wonderful part of his Return, overtopping anything"
7465,II.,"that Achilles did. Still Ulysses pays him the meed of heroship: ""We"
7466,II.,"Argives honored thee as a God, while living, and now thou art powerful"
7467,II.,"among the dead; therefore do not sorrow at thy death, O Achilles."" But"
7468,II.,he answers that he would rather be the humblest day laborer to a poor
7469,II.,"man than to be King of the Shades. It is not his world, he longs for"
7470,II.,"the realm of heroic action, here he has no vocation. No Troy to be"
7471,II.,"taken, no Hector to be vanquished down in Hades; the heroic man must"
7472,II.,sigh for the Upper World with its activity. Some consolation he gets
7473,II.,"from the account which Ulysses gives of his son, who was in the Wooden"
7474,II.,Horse and distinguished himself at Troy for bravery. Thus the father
7475,II.,"lives in his son and ""strides off delighted through the meadow of"
7476,II.,"asphodel."" This plant is usually regarded as the _Asphodelus ramosus_,"
7477,II.,"a kind of lily with an edible tuberous root, still planted, it is said,"
7478,II.,"on graves, to furnish to the dead some food which grows in the earth."
7479,II.,This ancient custom has been supposed to be the source of the legend of
7480,II.,its being transplanted to Hades.
7481,II.,
7482,II.,"The third heroic shade is that of Ajax, son of Telamon, with whom"
7483,II.,"Ulysses had a rivalry, the story of which runs as follows: After the"
7484,II.,"death of Achilles, Thetis his mother offered his arms, the work of"
7485,II.,"Vulcan, to the worthiest of the remaining Greek heroes. The contest lay"
7486,II.,"between Ajax and Ulysses. Agamemnon would not decide, but referred the"
7487,II.,"question to the Trojan prisoners present, asking them which of the two"
7488,II.,contestants had done them the most injury. They said Ulysses. Whereupon
7489,II.,"Ajax went crazy and slew himself. Now he appears in Hades, still"
7490,II.,unreconciled; it is really the most wretched lot of all. Ulysses here
7491,II.,"speaks the reconciling word, growing tender and imploring; but the hero"
7492,II.,"""answered not, darting away with the other shades into Erebos."" Wherein"
7493,II.,we may well see how much greater in spirit Ulysses was than his big
7494,II.,muscular rival. He has reached in this respect the true outcome of
7495,II.,"life's discipline: to have no revenges, and to speak the word of"
7496,II.,reconciliation.
7497,II.,
7498,II.,In fact the superiority of Ulysses over all these heroes is clearly
7499,II.,"manifested. He brings no captive woman home to his domestic hearth, and"
7500,II.,"hence he has a right to count upon Penelope's fidelity, though"
7501,II.,certainly he shows himself no saint in his wanderings. Moreover
7502,II.,"Agamemnon lacked foresight in his Return, which Ulysses will exhibit in"
7503,II.,a supreme degree when he first touches his native soil. The second
7504,II.,"hero, Achilles, could not conquer Troy, then he could not conquer"
7505,II.,Hades; yet both are conquered by Ulysses who is thus the greater.
7506,II.,"Finally unreconciled Ajax--all are limited, incomplete, in contrast"
7507,II.,"with the complete, limit-removing Hero, who has just removed even the"
7508,II.,limit of Death in the only way possible. Verily to him they have become
7509,II.,"shadows, that whole heroic world before Troy is now put by him into"
7510,II.,Hades.
7511,II.,
7512,II.,"Thus we see that, while the characters belong to the Trojan time, there"
7513,II.,"is a movement out of that period, it is transcended. The background"
7514,II.,"here is the Iliad, yet the incidents are taken from the Trojan war"
7515,II.,after the action of the Iliad is brought to a close. The fates of the
7516,II.,three great heroes of that poem are not given in the poem; here they
7517,II.,are given with a tragic emphasis. Thus the Odyssey carries forward the
7518,II.,"Iliad, supplements it, and forms its real conclusion, both being in"
7519,II.,fact one poem. In the full blaze of the glory of Achilles the Iliad
7520,II.,"ends; but he cannot take Troy; and still less, after his death, can"
7521,II.,"Ajax; the divine armor must go to Ulysses who has brain, then can the"
7522,II.,city be taken. Even the son of Achilles will fight under Ulysses and
7523,II.,"enter the Trojan Horse, the work of Pallas, of Intelligence. Thus we"
7524,II.,"catch here as in other places, glimpses of the unity of both the Iliad"
7525,II.,"and the Odyssey, the great work reflecting the one national"
7526,II.,consciousness of Hellas in its complete cycle.
7527,II.,
7528,II.,2. We should not fail to cast a separate glance at the three typical
7529,II.,"women of the Trojan epoch--Helen, Clytemnestra, Penelope--in contrast"
7530,II.,with the three heroes already described. They are all mentioned and
7531,II.,"compared in the speech of Agamemnon, but do not form an organic part of"
7532,II.,"the Book by themselves, as do the Pre-Trojan women. They are wives, and"
7533,II.,"wifehood not motherhood, as in the previous case, is the phase of the"
7534,II.,domestic relation which is the theme of song and struggle in their
7535,II.,lives. Possible its present importance is the reason why wifehood was
7536,II.,dismissed with so brief mention in the portion concerning the famous
7537,II.,mothers.
7538,II.,
7539,II.,"Note, then, the gradation of the three: Clytemnestra is the fallen"
7540,II.,"unrestored; Helen is the fallen restored; Penelope is the unfallen, who"
7541,II.,"keeps a home for her absent husband during twenty years. The tragic,"
7542,II.,"the mediated, the pure; or, to take a later analogy, the infernal, the"
7543,II.,"purgatorial, the paradisaical; such are the three typical female"
7544,II.,"characters of Homer, ranging from guilt, through repentance, to"
7545,II.,innocence. In this framework lies quite all possible characterization.
7546,II.,"Naturally Agamemnon shows a bitter vein of misogyny, with only his wife"
7547,II.,in view; but he takes it all back when he thinks of Penelope.
7548,II.,
7549,II.,"Two of these women, Helen and Penelope, are still alive and do not"
7550,II.,"belong to the realm of Hades; the ghost of the third, Clytemnestra,"
7551,II.,"does not appear. Still all three are mentioned here in the text, and"
7552,II.,"stand in relation to the three Greco-Trojan heroes, none of whom were"
7553,II.,"restored through the Return. Ulysses, however, is the real solution of"
7554,II.,"them all; he spans all their inadequacies, masters their fates, and"
7555,II.,reaches home. The three Greek heroes above mentioned fell by the way in
7556,II.,"the course of the grand problem, and are seen in Hades, complaining,"
7557,II.,"unhappy, showing their full limitation. To a degree they are suffering"
7558,II.,the penalty of their own shortcomings: which fact prepares us for the
7559,II.,third and last phase of the Underworld.
7560,II.,
7561,II.,
7562,III.,III.
7563,III.,
7564,III.,"We now come to a new division of the Book, which forms in itself a"
7565,III.,"complete little poem, yet is derived directly from the preceding"
7566,III.,"divisions, and is harmonious with them in thought, development and"
7567,III.,"structure. Undoubtedly there is a difference here, but the difference"
7568,III.,means not absolute separation but a connected unfolding of parts. The
7569,III.,present division has been assailed more violently by the critics and
7570,III.,torn out of its place with greater unanimity than any other portion of
7571,III.,"the Odyssey, with the possible exception of portions of the last two"
7572,III.,"Books. Let us confess, however, that our tendency is to reconcile, if"
7573,III.,"this can be done, the discords and to knit together the rent garment,"
7574,III.,"by threads not always on the surface, but very real to any eye which is"
7575,III.,willing to look underneath.
7576,III.,
7577,III.,"Unquestionably a punitive element enters now, there is guilt and"
7578,III.,punishment in Hades. But who has not felt that in the preceding
7579,III.,division the three Greek heroes were under the inevitable penalty of
7580,III.,their own deeds? Very natural is the transition. Indeed the three
7581,III.,divisions of the Book show a gradual movement toward a penal view of
7582,III.,Hades: the first (Tiresias and the Famous Mothers) has a slight
7583,III.,suggestion of the penalty; the second (the three Greek heroes) has the
7584,III.,idea of punishment implicit everywhere; the third makes the idea
7585,III.,explicit and organizes itself upon the same.
7586,III.,
7587,III.,"Again, there is a change of style, which now is strongly tinged with"
7588,III.,"the Orphic, initiatory, symbolical manner, in marked contrast with the"
7589,III.,clear-flowing narrative which has just preceded. But we noticed the
7590,III.,"same characteristic before, in the first division of the Book, where"
7591,III.,the sacrificial rites and the part of Tiresias were given. Homer has
7592,III.,"many styles, not each style has many Homers, nor is there a new Homer"
7593,III.,needed for each change of style. Note the great varieties of style in
7594,III.,the two Parts of Faust by way of illustration. Moreover we here pass
7595,III.,"into the dim Pre-Trojan epoch, as was the case in the first division,"
7596,III.,"but guilt is now flung into that time and with it the penalty. Hoary,"
7597,III.,"gigantic shapes of eld do wrong to the Gods, and are put into the"
7598,III.,punitory Hades. Thus this third division returns to the first with its
7599,III.,own new principle. In truth one may say that Homer herein shows
7600,III.,"features akin to Hesiod; well, Homer is Hesiod and many more."
7601,III.,
7602,III.,"We hold, therefore, that this third division is an organic part of the"
7603,III.,Book both in idea and structure; it carries to completion the thought
7604,III.,"of a world-justice, which Tiresias has already declared in his speech"
7605,III.,"to Ulysses, and which is exemplified in the three Greek heroes. Thus it"
7606,III.,"unfolds what lies in the first two divisions, and links them together"
7607,III.,"in a new and deeper thought. For this realm of Hades, hitherto a"
7608,III.,"distracted spot without any apparent order, now gets organized with its"
7609,III.,own Justiciary and its own Law. Yet here too we shall find a solution
7610,III.,"and a parallel; just as Ulysses was the true hero at Troy, standing"
7611,III.,"above all the others and solving their problems, so Hercules is the"
7612,III.,"great Pre-Trojan hero, saving himself at last and rising to Olympus."
7613,III.,Finally the two careers of Ulysses and Hercules are affirmed to be
7614,III.,"identical. This division, therefore, falls of itself into three"
7615,III.,"portions: (1) the Judge, (2) the condemned, (3) the redeemed. Thus the"
7616,III.,whole forms a complete little cycle within itself.
7617,III.,
7618,III.,"1. Minos, the Judge, was the ancient king of Crete, where he was"
7619,III.,lawgiver and suppressed wrong-doing on sea and land. Here he continues
7620,III.,"his vocation, which demands the assigning of the just penalty to the"
7621,III.,"guilty. He is manifestly the type of Justice, both punishing and"
7622,III.,rewarding; as punisher he has been transferred by Dante to the Inferno.
7623,III.,"Later Greek legend united with him two other judges, his brothers,"
7624,III.,Rhadamanthys and Æacus.
7625,III.,
7626,III.,"2. We have next four instances of punishment, though this is apparently"
7627,III.,"of different degrees. The wrong, however, is not stated except in the"
7628,III.,"case of Tityos, which probably hints the general nature of the misdeeds"
7629,III.,of the three others. The poet takes for granted that his hearer could
7630,III.,fill out each legend for himself. In every case there was evidently
7631,III.,"some violation done to the Gods, not to men--some crime against"
7632,III.,"Olympus. The period is thrown back into the Pre-Trojan time, into the"
7633,III.,age of the demigods and of the free intercourse between mortals and
7634,III.,immortals; thus it is parallel with the first division of the Book. But
7635,III.,now judgment has entered the Houses of Hades along with the penalty.
7636,III.,
7637,III.,"The guilt of Orion is that of love between a mortal and a Goddess,"
7638,III.,"Aurora, which violation was punished by the ""soft bolts"" of Artemis,"
7639,III.,protectress of chastity. This legend has already been alluded to by
7640,III.,Calypso. (Book V. line 121.) Jealous are the Gods of that mortal man
7641,III.,"with whom a Goddess falls in love, and with good reason. Orion's"
7642,III.,"punishment is an eternal chase, the hunter is compelled to hunt"
7643,III.,"forever, repeating what he did in life. Perhaps not a heavy punishment"
7644,III.,"for one who is fond of hunting; yet a tremendous burden, if never"
7645,III.,interrupted with rest; indeed it becomes a labor quite like the labor
7646,III.,"of Sisyphus, ever repeated. Of Tityos both the guilt and punishment are"
7647,III.,indicated; the legend is similar to and yet in contrast with that of
7648,III.,Orion; in the one the Goddess approaches the mortal and in the other
7649,III.,"the mortal approaches the Goddess; hence, too, the severer punishment"
7650,III.,in the latter case. The second legend ought to be completed here by a
7651,III.,fact derived from the story of Prometheus: the liver grows as fast as
7652,III.,the vultures rend or consume it; thus again rises the idea of infinite
7653,III.,"repetition, now of suffering, not of action, for Orion is active."
7654,III.,
7655,III.,"The next two forms, Tantalus and Sisyphus, have also a kinship. Both"
7656,III.,had known secrets of the Gods and had betrayed them; Tantalus is also
7657,III.,reported to have taken away nectar and ambrosia from the Olympian table
7658,III.,after being a guest there; Sisyphus revealed to the river-god Asopus
7659,III.,"the secret that Zeus had spirited away the latter's daughter, Ægina."
7660,III.,"The penalty is that Tantalus remains perpetually hungry and thirsty,"
7661,III.,with sight of food and drink always before his eyes; he cannot reach
7662,III.,"them when he strives. The finite, with an infinite longing, cannot"
7663,III.,compass the infinite; the man loses it just when he grasps for it--a
7664,III.,"truly Greek penalty for a sin against the Greek world, which rests upon"
7665,III.,the happy harmonious unity of the spirit with the body and with nature.
7666,III.,The Christian or Romantic longing and grasping for the Beyond is to the
7667,III.,Greek soul a punishment of Hades. Tantalus with his hunger and thirst
7668,III.,seems to represent more the striving of the intellect to attain the
7669,III.,unattainable; while Sisyphus suggests the effort of the will--practical
7670,III.,"endeavor, the eternal routine of mechanical employment, which always"
7671,III.,has to begin over again. Etymology brings also a suggestion. Both names
7672,III.,are reduplicated; in Tantalus is the root of the word which means to
7673,III.,"suffer; in Sisyphus, lurks the signification of craft; it hints the"
7674,III.,wise or crafty planner (_sophos_) who always pushes the act to a point
7675,III.,where it undoes itself or must be done over again. Note the effect of
7676,III.,"this reduplication of the first syllables, which means repetition; over"
7677,III.,"and over again, in an infinite series must the matter be gone through,"
7678,III.,in suffering and in doing; the very words are in labor.
7679,III.,
7680,III.,Indeed this indicates the common element in these four punishments: the
7681,III.,"endless repetition of the struggle of finitude. The first two, Orion"
7682,III.,"and Tityos, reached out for Goddesses, being mortals; the second two,"
7683,III.,"still mortals, but in communion with deities, attempted to bring down"
7684,III.,divine secrets to earth; the one set strove to make the finite
7685,III.,"infinite, the other to make the infinite finite. Both were contrary to"
7686,III.,"the nature of the Greek mind, which sought to keep the happy balance"
7687,III.,"between the two sides, between body and spirit, between the temporal"
7688,III.,and eternal. Now the punishment of these people is to give them their
7689,III.,"infinite, but in the form of an infinite repetition of their finite"
7690,III.,"act, which is just the spirit-crushing penalty. The power of these two"
7691,III.,"types, Tantalus and Sisyphus, is shown by the fact that all ages since"
7692,III.,Homer have adopted them and wrought them over into many forms of art
7693,III.,and poetry.
7694,III.,
7695,III.,"Here then is the unsolved problem of the Greek world, a problem which"
7696,III.,the Christian world has met and answered. Tantalus and Sisyphus are in
7697,III.,"pain and toil simply through themselves; man, however, must have the"
7698,III.,"power to reach the apples, and roll the stone up hill, he must assert"
7699,III.,"himself as limit-transcending, as infinite, for once and for all, and"
7700,III.,"not caught in an infinite series, which is a veritable mill of the"
7701,III.,"Gods, that is, of the Greek Gods. Now this strange fact comes to light:"
7702,III.,"Homer, seer that he is, has a dim consciousness of this solution, and"
7703,III.,"faintly but prophetically embodies it in a new figure, namely, that of"
7704,III.,"Hercules, which we shall now consider."
7705,III.,
7706,III.,"3. The Homeric solution is to divide the man, or to double him, into"
7707,III.,his shade (eidolon) and his self. The former belongs to Hades and
7708,III.,appears now; it is the finite Hercules with his striving and labors; he
7709,III.,"still has his bow and arrow, is ready to slay beasts, snakes, and"
7710,III.,"birds. He is in quite the same punishment as Orion or even Sisyphus,"
7711,III.,"the penalty of all finitude is upon him. Yet the other side is given,"
7712,III.,"that of victory. ""I, though the son of the highest God, Zeus, had to"
7713,III.,"endure boundless tribulation."" Strangely Christian does this sound. ""I"
7714,III.,"was put under service to a far inferior man to myself, who laid upon me"
7715,III.,"bitter labors."" The higher must serve and save the lower. ""Then the"
7716,III.,"mightiest labor I performed, I came down hither to Hades alive and"
7717,III.,"dragged thence the dog Cerberus""--conquered the great terror of the"
7718,III.,"Underworld. Thus Hercules has really transcended Hades, and so we read"
7719,III.,"here that ""he himself is among the immortal Gods, in bliss,"" that is,"
7720,III.,"his infinite nature is there, while the finite part is still below in"
7721,III.,"Hades. Such is the old poet's far-cast glance, reaching deep into the"
7722,III.,future and beyond the Greek world.
7723,III.,
7724,III.,"Still another significant word is spoken. ""O Ulysses, unhappy man! Thou"
7725,III.,"dost experience the same hard fate which I endured upon the earth."""
7726,III.,Thus does Hercules identify the career of Ulysses with his own--the
7727,III.,"same striving and suffering, and the same final victory, the peace of"
7728,III.,"Olympus. Who cannot attain the latter is a Tantalus, seeking but never"
7729,III.,reaching the fruit. Such is the outcome and culmination of Hades; after
7730,III.,"Hercules has spoken, no further word is heard by Ulysses."
7731,III.,
7732,III.,"Dante, whose poem on so many lines grows out of this Eleventh Book, has"
7733,III.,also the same duplication of the person in his Paradise. The soul is in
7734,III.,"its special planet, Venus, Mars, etc., and also it is in the highest"
7735,III.,"Heaven, enjoying the Vision of God. But Dante universalizes the Greek"
7736,III.,"view, making it truly Christian; all men are children of God and can"
7737,III.,"attain the seats of the Blessed, not merely the one man, the Hero"
7738,III.,Hercules. Still even here the inference is that Ulysses must also be
7739,III.,"transferred to Olympus, though no such declaration is made."
7740,III.,
7741,III.,"We hope the reader feels how inadequate Hades would be, and how"
7742,III.,"incomplete the experience of Ulysses would be, if this last division of"
7743,III.,the Book were cut out. The wanderer has now gone through the total
7744,III.,"cycle of the Underworld, not only outwardly, but inwardly; he is just"
7745,III.,"ready to step out of it, because he is beyond it in spirit. This last"
7746,III.,step is now to be given in Homeric fashion.
7747,III.,
7748,III.,"There is a danger at present rising strongly into consciousness, a"
7749,III.,danger inherent in this too-long contemplation of Hades; it is the
7750,III.,"danger of the Gorgon, the monster whose view turns the spectator into"
7751,III.,"stone, taking away all sensation, emotion, life. The Greek sooner or"
7752,III.,"later must quit Hades, and flee from its shapes; the supersensible"
7753,III.,"world he must transfuse into the sensible, else the former will rush"
7754,III.,"over into the fantastic, the horrible, the ugly. The Gorgon is down in"
7755,III.,"Hades too, having been slain in the terrestrial Upperworld by a Greek"
7756,III.,"Hero, Perseus, who slew the monster of the Orient which once guarded"
7757,III.,"the fair Andromeda, a kind of Pre-Trojan Helen, chained in captivity,"
7758,III.,whom the heroic Hellenic soul came to release. Ulysses has now reached
7759,III.,"the Greek limit, Oriental phantasms will rise unless there be a speedy"
7760,III.,"return to the reality, to the realm of sense. Hades has furnished its"
7761,III.,"highest image in Hercules, beware of its worst. Already the Underworld"
7762,III.,"has been in danger of running into the fantastic; then Beauty, the"
7763,III.,"Hellenic ideal, would be lost. The figures of Homeric Hades hitherto"
7764,III.,"have all been men and women, but the monsters are ready to come forth."
7765,III.,So they did come forth in the later Greek world under the spur of
7766,III.,Oriental influence; witness the Revelations of St. John in the Island
7767,III.,"of Patmos, joint product of Greek and Hebrew spirit, showing truly the"
7768,III.,dissolution of the Hellenic ideal.
7769,III.,
7770,III.,"Thus Ulysses, the supreme spiritual Hero of the Greeks, is shown"
7771,III.,"running away from the Underworld, fearing to look upon coming shapes in"
7772,III.,"Hades; about which fact two reflections can be made: first, Ulysses had"
7773,III.,"to do this in order to remain a Greek; secondly, the poet clearly"
7774,III.,"announces, in such an action, that there is another world lying beyond"
7775,III.,"his world, that underneath the Greek Hades is another Hades, which"
7776,III.,threatens to rise into view. That Hades will burst up hereafter and
7777,III.,become the Christian Hell. Ulysses confesses that there is a realm
7778,III.,"beyond him there, which he has not conquered, has not even dared to"
7779,III.,"see, and thus he significantly points to the future. The Gorgon is a"
7780,III.,"shadowy anticipation of fiends, of devils, of the infernal monsters of"
7781,III.,"the Romantic Netherworld of Dante, who is to be the next great Hero,"
7782,III.,"passing into the dark world beyond with a new light. To be sure, Virgil"
7783,III.,"sends Æneas into Orcus, and makes such descent a Book of his poem, but"
7784,III.,"Virgil too speaks of a realm beyond his Orcus, which his Hero does not"
7785,III.,enter. Thus the Roman poet shows substantially the same limits as the
7786,III.,"Greek poet, whom he has for the most part copied."
7787,III.,
7788,III.,"Here again we find a conception embodied in song, on which the human"
7789,III.,"mind has moved through many ages. Poetry, Art, Theology, have taken"
7790,III.,from this Eleventh Book of the Odyssey many creative hints: it is truly
7791,III.,an epoch-making work in the history of man's spiritual unfolding. As
7792,III.,"already stated, Virgil repeats it, Dante grows out of it and makes it"
7793,III.,"over, in accord with the spirit of Christendom, which has many a root"
7794,III.,running back to this Homeric Hades. The present Book may be called the
7795,III.,"Greek prophecy heralding medieval Art, and shows old Homer"
7796,III.,foreshadowing Romanticism. Did he not see the limits of his world? The
7797,III.,"particular connecting link between two Literary Bibles, Homer and"
7798,III.,"Dante, is just the present Book, even if Dante never read Homer. For"
7799,III.,"the study of Universal Literature it is, therefore, a specially"
7800,III.,"important document. A many-sided production also; its poetic, its"
7801,III.,"religious, its artistic, its philosophical sides are all present in"
7802,III.,full activity and put to test the spiritual alertness of the reader.
7803,III.,
7804,III.,Wherein does the negative nature of Hades lie? The question rises from
7805,III.,the fact that Ulysses in Fableland has been declared to be passing
7806,III.,through various negative phases; such is the expression often used
7807,III.,"already. First of all, it is a negating of the sensible world and a"
7808,III.,"going into the supersensible, a seeking of the spirit without the body."
7809,III.,"Hades was quite the opposite of the Greek mind, which demanded"
7810,III.,"embodiment, and hence was inherently artistic. Still the Greek mind"
7811,III.,"created a Hades, and finally went over into the pure Idea in Plato and"
7812,III.,the philosophers. Even Homer seems to feel that philosophy is at last a
7813,III.,"needful discipline, that the abstract thought must be taken from its"
7814,III.,"concrete wrappage, that the Universal must be freed from the"
7815,III.,Particular.
7816,III.,
7817,III.,Ulysses has to pass through Hades in order to complete the cycle of his
7818,III.,"experience, and realize what is beyond the senses; he must know the"
7819,III.,spirit apart from the body in this life; he must see the Past as it is
7820,III.,in its great disembodied minds; he must behold the famous heroes of
7821,III.,"Troy as they are in reality, not as they are in the glamor of poetry."
7822,III.,As tested by their life and deeds he sees them below in the
7823,III.,"Netherworld; Greek souls stark naked in Hades he beholds, and then"
7824,III.,rises out of it.
7825,III.,
7826,III.,"_Retrospect._ Very important, in our judgment, is this Eleventh Book;"
7827,III.,"it is really one of the sacred documents of Universal Religion, as well"
7828,III.,"as a great creative idea in the World's Literature, But it has fared"
7829,III.,badly as to its friends; for interpretation it usually falls into the
7830,III.,"hands of the negative, merely critical Understanding, which has the"
7831,III.,"unfortunate habit of turning Professor of Greek, commentator on Homer,"
7832,III.,and philologer generally. In order to grasp and connect its leading
7833,III.,"points more completely, we shall look back at the thought and structure"
7834,III.,of the Book once more.
7835,III.,
7836,III.,"First of all, there must be felt and seen the necessity of taking this"
7837,III.,"journey to the Netherworld on the part of the Hero, the complete person"
7838,III.,of his time. The very conception of the universal man must include the
7839,III.,visit to the realm of the Idea; the passage from the sensible to the
7840,III.,"supersensible, is the deepest need of his soul. Homer can give this"
7841,III.,"spiritual movement only in a mythical form, hence it occurs here in"
7842,III.,Fableland. So Ulysses has to make the transition from Circe to Hades.
7843,III.,
7844,III.,"Having the entire Book now before us, we observe that it shows a"
7845,III.,"threefold movement; that is, one movement with three leading stages."
7846,III.,These take the shape of three communications from the realm of the
7847,III.,"dead, which includes all past Time, imparted to the living who are now"
7848,III.,"present, namely the Phæacians, through Ulysses, who has had this cycle"
7849,III.,of experiences and now sings them. But that which is true in past Time
7850,III.,"must be seen to be true in all Time--Past, Present and Future. So there"
7851,III.,"unfolds the idea of a World-Order, foretold at first by the Pre-Trojan"
7852,III.,"prophet Tiresias, illustrated by the fate of the three Greco-Trojan"
7853,III.,"heroes in Hades, and finally realized and active in the realm of Minos."
7854,III.,"The whole has, therefore, the secret underlying thought of a"
7855,III.,"world-tribunal, which works through all human history; it is a kind of"
7856,III.,Last Judgment to which the deeds of men are appealed for final
7857,III.,adjudication; it most profoundly suggests in its movement the ethical
7858,III.,order of the Universe. Let us briefly sum up its three stages.
7859,III.,
7860,III.,I. The first communication from the Hades of the Past to the real world
7861,III.,"of the Present through Ulysses is that of the prophet Tiresias, ""whose"
7862,III.,"mind is whole;"" he may be called the pure Idea (as subjective) uttering"
7863,III.,"the Idea (as objective, as principle of the world). For he beholds the"
7864,III.,"truth of things as they are in their essence, he himself being the"
7865,III.,impersonation of Truth. Thus he looks through the Future and foretells;
7866,III.,"he knows that Neptune will avenge the deed done to Polyphemus, that the"
7867,III.,"Oxen of the Sun constitute a great danger, that Ulysses will punish the"
7868,III.,Suitors; then he prophesies the peace and final harmony of Ulysses
7869,III.,"after his long conflict and separation from home, country, and the"
7870,III.,Divine Order.
7871,III.,
7872,III.,"So speaks Tiresias and is therein a kind of world-judge, prefiguring"
7873,III.,Minos of the last stage of Hades. For he prophesies according to the
7874,III.,"law of the deed; what you have done is sure to return upon you, be it"
7875,III.,good or bad. Hence he can tell what will happen to Ulysses for acts
7876,III.,already committed (the wrath of Neptune); he can give a warning
7877,III.,concerning things which Ulysses may do (the slaying of the Oxen of the
7878,III.,Sun); he can affirm the certain punishment of guilt (the case of the
7879,III.,"Suitors). Thus the prophet voices a world-justice, which inflicts the"
7880,III.,"penalty unflinchingly, but also bears within itself reconciliation."
7881,III.,"Such is the prophetic Idea, appearing in advance, not yet ordered and"
7882,III.,realized.
7883,III.,
7884,III.,II. The second communication from Hades to the Phæacians through
7885,III.,"Ulysses comes from the Trojan Past, and is voiced by the three most"
7886,III.,"famous heroes of the Iliad--Achilles, Agamemnon, Ajax (the last one,"
7887,III.,"however, does not speak, but acts out his communication). All three are"
7888,III.,"tragic characters, are the victims of fate, that is, of their own fatal"
7889,III.,"limitations. Such is the world-judgment here, it is really pronounced"
7890,III.,by themselves upon themselves in each case. Agamemnon states his own
7891,III.,"guilt, Achilles shows his limit by his complaint, Ajax does not need to"
7892,III.,speak. Ulysses simply listens and sees; now he tells the story of Troy
7893,III.,"and its heroes anew to the Present, indicating how they have put"
7894,III.,themselves into Hades.
7895,III.,
7896,III.,The intimate connection between this part and the preceding part of
7897,III.,Tiresias is plain. The prophet has forecast the law which rules these
7898,III.,"heroes also; they are truly illustrations of his prophecy, or of its"
7899,III.,underlying principle. They expose the heroic insufficiency of that
7900,III.,"Trojan time; they are the negative, tragic phases of greatness, which"
7901,III.,have also to submit at last to the law of compensation. Thus is the
7902,III.,"illustrious Trojan epoch judged and sent down below; but mark! Ulysses,"
7903,III.,"of that same epoch, survives, is present, and is singing the judgment."
7904,III.,
7905,III.,III. The world-justice which ideally underlies the prophecies of
7906,III.,"Tiresias in the first part of the present Book, and which is the secret"
7907,III.,moving principle in the fates of the three Greco-Trojan heroes in the
7908,III.,"second part, becomes explicit, recognized and ordered in the third"
7909,III.,"part, which is now to be given. There is first the world-judge, Minos,"
7910,III.,"famous for his justice during life, distributing both penalties and"
7911,III.,"rewards in the Netherworld. Secondly we see the condemned ones, Orion,"
7912,III.,"Tityus, Tantalus, Sisyphus (mark the significant reduplication of the"
7913,III.,root in the names of each one of them). All four are represented as
7914,III.,having wronged the Gods in some way; they have violated the Divine
7915,III.,"Order, according to the Greek conception; hence the tribunal of"
7916,III.,"world-justice, now organized and at work in Hades, takes them in hand."
7917,III.,"To be sure, the text of Homer does not say that they were sentenced by"
7918,III.,"the decree of Minos, but such is certainly the implication. These four"
7919,III.,"had a common sin, to the Greek mind: they sought to transcend the limit"
7920,III.,"which the Gods have placed upon finite man, hence the image of their"
7921,III.,"penalty lies in the endless repetition of their acts, which is also"
7922,III.,suggested in their names. Orion has always to pursue and slay the wild
7923,III.,"beast, never getting the work done; the liver of Tityus grows and"
7924,III.,"swells afresh (root from _tu_, meaning to swell, Latin _tumor_) though"
7925,III.,being consumed by the vultures; in like manner Tantalus and Sisyphus
7926,III.,have ever-repeated labors. Such is the glimpse here of the Greek Hades
7927,III.,of eternal punishment. Now comes the curious fact that the heroic man
7928,III.,through labor and suffering can rise out of this Hades of finitude; he
7929,III.,"can satisfy the demand of world-justice, and rise to Olympus among the"
7930,III.,"blessed Gods. Such was Hercules, and such is to be Ulysses, who now"
7931,III.,having seen the culmination of Hades and heard its prophecy of his
7932,III.,"future state, leaves it and returns to the Upperworld."
7933,III.,
7934,III.,Undoubtedly these thoughts of future punishment and reward are very dim
7935,III.,and shadowy in Homer; still they are here in this Eleventh Book of the
7936,III.,"Odyssey, and find their true interpretation in that view of the life to"
7937,III.,come into which they unfolded with time. The best commentary on this
7938,III.,"Book, we repeat, is the _Divine Comedy_ of Dante, the grand poem of"
7939,III.,"futurity, which carries out to fullness the order, of which we here"
7940,III.,catch a little glimpse.

7946,_BOOK TWELFTH._,
7947,_BOOK TWELFTH._,
7948,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"Ulysses flees from the Underworld, there is something down there which"
7949,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"he feels he cannot master, something which he has not seen but of which"
7950,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"he has a vague presentiment. The Gorgon stands for much, dimly"
7951,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"foreshadowing a Hades beyond or below the Greek Hades, with which,"
7952,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"however, it is not his call to grapple. Hence the poet puts upon his"
7953,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"Hero a limitation at this point, strangely prophetic, and sends him in"
7954,_BOOK TWELFTH._,haste back to the terrestrial Upperworld. The bark crossed the stream
7955,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"of the ""river Oceanus,"" then it entered ""the wide-wayed Sea"" in which"
7956,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"lay the island of Circe, ""where are the houses of the Dawn, and her"
7957,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"dances, and the risings of the Sun."" Verily the Hero has got back to"
7958,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"the beginning of the world of light, in which he is now to have a new"
7959,_BOOK TWELFTH._,span of existence after his experience in the supersensible realm.
7960,_BOOK TWELFTH._,
7961,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"From the brief geographical glances which we catch up from the voyage,"
7962,_BOOK TWELFTH._,as well as from a number of hints scattered throughout the Odyssey (for
7963,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"instance, from what is said of the Ethiopians in the First Book), we"
7964,_BOOK TWELFTH._,are inclined to believe that Homer held the earth to be round. We like
7965,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"to think of the old Poet seeing this fact, not as a deduction of"
7966,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"science, not even as a misty tradition from some other land, but as an"
7967,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"immediate act of poetic insight, which beholds the law of the physical"
7968,_BOOK TWELFTH._,world rising out of the spiritual by the original creative fiat; the
7969,_BOOK TWELFTH._,Poet witnesses the necessity by which nature conforms to mind. Homer
7970,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"knew the spiritual Return, this whole Odyssey is such a Return, whereby"
7971,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"the soul is rounded off to completeness, and becomes a true totality."
7972,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"Why should he not apply the same law to nature, to the whole Earth, and"
7973,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"behold it, not indefinitely extended as it appears to the senses, but"
7974,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"returning into itself, whereby the line becomes a circle and the plain"
7975,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"a globe? Some such need lay deep in his poetic soul, to which he had to"
7976,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"harmonize the entire universe, visible as well as invisible. Not"
7977,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"science is this, but an immediate vision of the true, always prophetic,"
7978,_BOOK TWELFTH._,which observes the impress of spirit everywhere upon the realm of
7979,_BOOK TWELFTH._,matter. The old Greek sages seem to have known not merely of the
7980,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"rotundity of the Earth, but also of its movement round the Sun and upon"
7981,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"its own axis, both movements being circular, returns, which image mind."
7982,_BOOK TWELFTH._,Did they get their knowledge from Egypt or Chaldea? Questionable; if
7983,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"they looked inwardly deep enough, they could find it all there. Indeed"
7984,_BOOK TWELFTH._,the sages of Egypt and Chaldea saw the fact in their souls ere they saw
7985,_BOOK TWELFTH._,it or could see it in the skies.
7986,_BOOK TWELFTH._,
7987,_BOOK TWELFTH._,So these Homeric glimpses into the realm of what is to become science
7988,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"are not to be neglected or despised, in spite of their mythical,"
7989,_BOOK TWELFTH._,ambiguous vesture. Moreover they are in profound harmony with the
7990,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"present poem, to which they furnish remote, but very suggestive"
7991,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"parallels, making the physical universe correspond to the spiritual"
7992,_BOOK TWELFTH._,unfolding of the Hero.
7993,_BOOK TWELFTH._,
7994,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"Ulysses, accordingly, comes back to the sensible world and there he"
7995,_BOOK TWELFTH._,finds Circe again. Indeed whom else ought he to find? She is the bright
7996,_BOOK TWELFTH._,Greek realm of the senses reposing in sunlight; she has been
7997,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"subordinated to the rational, she is no longer the indulgence of"
7998,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"appetite which turns men to swine, nor is she, on the other hand, the"
7999,_BOOK TWELFTH._,rigid ascetic. Hence we need not be surprised at her bringing good
8000,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"things to eat and drink: ""bread and many kinds of meat and sparkling"
8001,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"red wine."" Moreover, she is still prophetic, she still has the outlook"
8002,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"upon the Beyond, being spirit in the senses. Her present prophecies,"
8003,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"however, will be different from her former one, she will point to the"
8004,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"supersensible, not in Hades, for that is now past, but in the"
8005,_BOOK TWELFTH._,Upperworld of life and experience. Such is the return of the Hero to
8006,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"Circe, the fair, the terrestrial, who makes existence beautiful if she"
8007,_BOOK TWELFTH._,be properly held in restraint; beautiful as sunlit Hellas with its
8008,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"plastic forms she can become, in striking contrast to the dark shapes"
8009,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"of the sunless Underworld which leads to the Gorgon, the realm of"
8010,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"spooks, shades, fiends, in general of romanticism."
8011,_BOOK TWELFTH._,
8012,_BOOK TWELFTH._,So much for Circe in her new relation in the present Book; how about
8013,_BOOK TWELFTH._,Ulysses? It is manifest that he too is prepared for a fresh experience.
8014,_BOOK TWELFTH._,He has been in the Underworld and great has been the profit. There he
8015,_BOOK TWELFTH._,has seen the famous men and women of old and beheld the very heart of
8016,_BOOK TWELFTH._,their destiny; the Trojan and the Pre-Trojan worthies sweeping backward
8017,_BOOK TWELFTH._,through all Greek time he has witnessed and in part heard; he has
8018,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"become acquainted with the prophet Tiresias who knows Past, Present and"
8019,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"Future, who is the universal mind in its purity from all material"
8020,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"dross; he has beheld the Place of Doom and its penalties, as well as"
8021,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"the supreme Greek Hero, the universal man of action, Hercules. Nor must"
8022,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"we forget that he has run upon a limitation, that Gorgon from whom he"
8023,_BOOK TWELFTH._,fled. Truly he has obtained in this journey to Hades a grand experience
8024,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"of the Past, of all Greek ages, which is now added to his own personal"
8025,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"experience. So this Past, with its knowledge, is to be applied to the"
8026,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"Future, whereby knowledge becomes foreknowledge, and experience is to"
8027,_BOOK TWELFTH._,be transformed into prophecy. Mark then the transition from the
8028,_BOOK TWELFTH._,previous to the present Book: when Ulysses comes back to the world of
8029,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"sense, he will at once see in it the supersensible, which he has just"
8030,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"behold; he must hear in the Present a prophetic voice, that of Circe"
8031,_BOOK TWELFTH._,proclaiming the Future.
8032,_BOOK TWELFTH._,
8033,_BOOK TWELFTH._,Thus Ulysses is now ready to listen to the coming event and to
8034,_BOOK TWELFTH._,understand its import. It is to be observed that up to the Eleventh
8035,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"Book he has had experience merely; he took everything as it came, by"
8036,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"chance, without knowing of it beforehand; he simply happens upon the"
8037,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"Lotus-eaters, Polyphemus, Circe, though the careful reader has not"
8038,_BOOK TWELFTH._,failed to note an interior thread of connection between all these
8039,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"adventures. As to Hades, it is pointed out to him in advance by Circe,"
8040,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"though all is not foretold him; but in the Twelfth Book, now to be"
8041,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"considered, he has everything in detail laid open to him beforehand. A"
8042,_BOOK TWELFTH._,great change in manner of treatment; why? Because Ulysses must be shown
8043,_BOOK TWELFTH._,as having reached the stage of foreknowledge through his journey to
8044,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"Hades; hitherto he was the mere empirical man, or blind adventurer,"
8045,_BOOK TWELFTH._,surrendering himself to hazard and trusting to his cunning for getting
8046,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"out of trouble. But now he foresees, and Circe is the voice thereof; he"
8047,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"knows what he has to go through before he starts, here in the"
8048,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"Upperworld, to which he has come back, and through whose conflicts he"
8049,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"is still to pass, for life has not yet ended. Such, we think, is the"
8050,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"fruit of that trip to the Underworld, the supersensible is seen in the"
8051,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"sensible, and the Future becomes transparent."
8052,_BOOK TWELFTH._,
8053,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"Accordingly Circe foretells, and Ulysses foreknows; the two are"
8054,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"counterparts. Then he simply goes through what has been predicted, he"
8055,_BOOK TWELFTH._,fills up the outline with the deed.
8056,_BOOK TWELFTH._,
8057,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"This is the essential fact of the Book, which is organized by it into"
8058,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"two portions, namely the prophecy and the fulfillment; Circe has one"
8059,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"part, Ulysses the other. Moreover each part exhibits the same general"
8060,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"movement, which has three phases with the same names: the Sirens, the"
8061,_BOOK TWELFTH._,"Plangctæ on the one hand with Scylla and Charybdis on the other, and"
8062,_BOOK TWELFTH._,the Oxen of the Sun.
8063,_BOOK TWELFTH._,
8064,_BOOK TWELFTH._,
8065,I.,I.
8066,I.,
8067,I.,"As soon as Ulysses, after coming back from Hades, had performed the"
8068,I.,"last rites over the corpse of Elpenor, Circe appears and makes a"
8069,I.,"striking address: ""O ye audacious, who still living have gone down to"
8070,I.,"the house of Hades--ye twice-dead, while others die but once."" Such is"
8071,I.,"one side of Circe, now rises the other: ""But come, eat food, drink wine"
8072,I.,"the whole day;"" let us have a Greek festival ere new labors begin. Then"
8073,I.,"Circe holds a private conference with Ulysses, she asked each thing"
8074,I.,"""about the journey to Hades,"" which, it seems, she must know ere she"
8075,I.,can foretell the remaining part.
8076,I.,
8077,I.,One cannot help feeling in this passage that the poet hints that these
8078,I.,prophecies of Circe have some connection with what Ulysses imparts to
8079,I.,her concerning Hades. Indeed she repeats what Tiresias had already
8080,I.,foretold in reference to the Oxen of the Sun--a matter which she
8081,I.,probably heard from Ulysses. Cannot the other two adventures be derived
8082,I.,in a general way from the experiences of the Underworld? The Past seems
8083,I.,"here to furnish the groundwork for the predictions of the Future, and"
8084,I.,"Circe, knowing what has been in the pure forms of the supersensible,"
8085,I.,becomes the voice of what is to be.
8086,I.,
8087,I.,"1. First come the Sirens, whom Ulysses will have to meet again, as he"
8088,I.,"has often met them before. Indeed Circe herself was once a Siren, a"
8089,I.,"charmer through the senses. The present Sirens are singers, and entice"
8090,I.,"to destruction through the sense of hearing, inasmuch as ""heaps of"
8091,I.,"bones lie about them,"" evidently the skeletons of persons who have"
8092,I.,perished through their seductive song. Pass them the man must; what is
8093,I.,to be done? He will have somehow to guard against his sensuous nature
8094,I.,and keep it from destroying itself. Yet on the other hand he must
8095,I.,"enjoy, which is his right in this world of sensations; each good music"
8096,I.,must be heard. So Circe tells of the scheme of putting wax into his
8097,I.,"companions' ears, while he is bound to the mast. Already Tiresias"
8098,I.,warned Ulysses in the Underworld to hold his appetite in check and that
8099,I.,"of his companions, if he wished to return home. This warning Circe now"
8100,I.,"repeats, indeed she repeats in a new mythical form her own experience,"
8101,I.,"for she, the Siren, has also been met by Ulysses and mastered. Yet"
8102,I.,these later charmers seem to have been more dangerous. When they are
8103,I.,"passed, a new peril rises of necessity."
8104,I.,
8105,I.,"2. Next we behold an image, or rather two sets of images, of the grand"
8106,I.,dualism of existence. That escape from the Sirens is really no solution
8107,I.,"of the problem, it is external and leaves the man still unfree, still"
8108,I.,subject to his senses. There must be somehow an inner control through
8109,I.,"the understanding, an intellectual subordination. But just here trouble"
8110,I.,"springs up again. The mind has two sides to it, and is certain to fall"
8111,I.,"into self-opposition. Two are the ways after parting from the Sirens,"
8112,I.,"says Circe: ""I shall tell thee of both."""
8113,I.,
8114,I.,One way is by the Plangctæ (rocks which clasp together); here no bird
8115,I.,"can fly through without getting caught, even the doves of Zeus pay the"
8116,I.,"penalty. ""No ship of men, having gone thither, has ever escaped""--except"
8117,I.,the God-directed Argo: surely a sufficient warning. Then the second way
8118,I.,"also leads to two rocks, but of a different kind; at their bases in the"
8119,I.,"sea are found Scylla, the monstrous sea-bitch, on one side, and"
8120,I.,"Charybdis, the yawning maelstrom, on the other; between them Ulysses"
8121,I.,must pass with his ship and companions.
8122,I.,
8123,I.,"It is manifest that here are two alternatives, one after the other; the"
8124,I.,"first is that of the Plangctæ, the Claspers, which mean Death, unless"
8125,I.,"they be avoided, yet this avoidance does not always mean Life. We can"
8126,I.,trace the connection with the Sirens: the absolute resignation to the
8127,I.,"senses is license, is destruction; we may say the same thing of the"
8128,I.,"opposite, the absolute suppression of man's sensuous being is simply"
8129,I.,his dissolution. Hence the extremes appear; the moral and the immoral
8130,I.,extremes land us in the same place; they are the two mighty rocks which
8131,I.,may smite together and crush the poor mortal who happens to get in
8132,I.,"between the closing surfaces. If we understand the image, it holds true"
8133,I.,of excess on either side; excessive indulgence is overwhelmed by its
8134,I.,"opposite, so is excessive abstinence; they co-operate, like two valves,"
8135,I.,for the destruction of the one-sided extremist. Truly Greek is the
8136,I.,"thought, for the Greek maxim above all others was moderation, no"
8137,I.,"over-doing. Such then are the Plangctæ, which Ulysses must avoid"
8138,I.,"wholly, if he wishes to escape. Still, even the danger is by no means"
8139,I.,over.
8140,I.,
8141,I.,There is the second way which introduces a new alternative; the path of
8142,I.,"moderation has its difficulty, it too forks and produces perplexity and"
8143,I.,peril to the voyager. Here is the point where Scylla and Charybdis
8144,I.,"appear, a new set of extremes, between which the mean is to be sought,"
8145,I.,"then the passage can be made. Yet even thus it costs, Ulysses will lose"
8146,I.,"six of his companions; the penalty has to be paid, just the penalty of"
8147,I.,moderation. _Es rächt sich alles auf Erden._ Two sets of extremes
8148,I.,"always; if you shun one set and take the middle path, just this act of"
8149,I.,shunning produces a second set; cut the magnet in twain with its two
8150,I.,"poles, then each part will at once have two poles of its own. Such is"
8151,I.,"indeed the very dialectic of life, the dualism of existence, which the"
8152,I.,"heroic voyager is to overcome with suffering, with danger, with many"
8153,I.,penalties.
8154,I.,
8155,I.,"Fault has often been found with this duplication of the alternative,"
8156,I.,"but when rightly seen into, it will show itself as the central fact of"
8157,I.,the entire description. It casts an image of the never-ceasing
8158,I.,differentiation both in the mind and in the world; it hints the
8159,I.,"recurring contradiction in all thought and in all conduct, always to be"
8160,I.,"solved, yet never quite solved. What else indeed has man to do? To"
8161,I.,"master the contradiction gives him life, movement, energy, and it must"
8162,I.,be mastered every day. The old poet is going to the bottom of the
8163,I.,matter. The above mentioned repetition of the alternative has its
8164,I.,correspondence with the repetition which we have seen to be the
8165,I.,fundamental form into which the whole Book is cast.
8166,I.,
8167,I.,"Plainly the Double Alternative here mythically set forth, springs out"
8168,I.,"of the conflict with the Sirens, and is a deepening of the same to the"
8169,I.,"very bottom. Indulgence kills, abstinence kills, in their excess; and"
8170,I.,the middle path bifurcates into two new extremes with their problem.
8171,I.,"Prophetic Circe can tell all this, for does it not lie just in the"
8172,I.,"domain of her experience, which has also been twofold? Pure forms of"
8173,I.,"spirit, wholly non-natural, are these figures representing the Double"
8174,I.,"Alternative, created by the Imagination to express Thought."
8175,I.,
8176,I.,3. The final warning of Circe is mainly a repetition of what Tiresias
8177,I.,had told Ulysses already in the Underworld; from the latter she heard
8178,I.,it and puts it here into its place. Beware of slaying the cattle of the
8179,I.,"Sun, oxen and sheep in two flocks, over which two bright nymphs keep"
8180,I.,guard. There can scarcely be a doubt concerning the physical basis of
8181,I.,"this myth. The seven herds of oxen, fifty to the herd, suggest the"
8182,I.,number of days in the lunar year (really 354); the seven herds of sheep
8183,I.,suggest the corresponding nights. Lampelia (the Moon or Lamp of Night)
8184,I.,is the keeper of the one; Phæthusa (the Radiant one) is the keeper of
8185,I.,the other--namely the Sun as the day-bringer. Seldom has the old Aryan
8186,I.,form of the myth been so well preserved; the whole reads like a
8187,I.,transcript out of the Vedas.
8188,I.,
8189,I.,Still stronger than the physical side is the spiritual suggestion. The
8190,I.,slaughter of these cattle of the Sun points to the supreme act of
8191,I.,"negation in the intellectual man, to the sin against light. Ulysses and"
8192,I.,"his companions now know the way to reach home, having had the grand"
8193,I.,experience with the Sirens and then with the Double Alternative;
8194,I.,"moreover the leader has heard the warning twice. If they now do wrong,"
8195,I.,"it will be a wrong against the Sun, against Intelligence itself."
8196,I.,
8197,I.,A certain critic finds fault with Circe because she repeats the warning
8198,I.,"of Tiresias, and he holds that some botcher or editor, not Homer,"
8199,I.,transferred the passage from one place to the other. Yet this
8200,I.,"repetition is not only an organic necessity of the poem, but gives an"
8201,I.,insight into the character of Circe: she cannot foresee of herself the
8202,I.,"great intellectual transgression, but Tiresias can; the Sirens and the"
8203,I.,"Double Alternative, however, lie within her own experience. So she"
8204,I.,"copies where she cannot originate, and in this way she is decidedly"
8205,I.,"distinguished from Tiresias, though both are prophetic."
8206,I.,
8207,I.,"Such is the outlook upon the Future given by Circe, in the way of"
8208,I.,"warning, whereby the warned know what is coming. In the three"
8209,I.,"adventures we feel a certain connection, in fact an unfolding of one"
8210,I.,"out of the other, beginning with the primary conflict of the Senses,"
8211,I.,"which soon rises into the Understanding, and finally ends in a revolt"
8212,I.,"against Reason itself, the source of Light. They have the character of"
8213,I.,"typical forms, derived from the Past, yet they are certain to recur"
8214,I.,"again, and hence can be foretold."
8215,I.,
8216,I.,
8217,II.,II.
8218,II.,
8219,II.,"We now have reached the second portion of the Book, which is the"
8220,II.,fulfillment of the prophecies of the first portion; moreover we see how
8221,II.,the forewarnings are heeded. Ulysses and his companions enter their
8222,II.,"vessel and start once more upon the sea, leaving the island of Circe,"
8223,II.,who sends them a favorable wind. We note also that Ulysses always
8224,II.,"repeats the warning to his companions, and tells to what they are"
8225,II.,coming next; they are to share in his knowledge. Three times he does
8226,II.,"this, just before each incident, and thus prepares them, though he does"
8227,II.,not tell everything. The experience with the Bag of Winds has taught
8228,II.,him much; his companions through ignorance of its nature opened it and
8229,II.,the fatality followed. So he received the penalty of not sharing his
8230,II.,"knowledge with his fellows; now he avoids that mistake, for his conduct"
8231,II.,at present shows that he regards his failure to impart his information
8232,II.,"as a mistake. He was the cause of the ignorance of his companions,"
8233,II.,"which was brought home to him by their deed. Now he tells them, still"
8234,II.,he will not be able to save them; the fault is theirs when they
8235,II.,"transgress, and they will receive the penalty."
8236,II.,
8237,II.,"1. In accord with the plan already foretold, the ship approaches the"
8238,II.,"island of the Sirens, Ulysses fills the ears of his men with wax and"
8239,II.,"enjoys the song, being tied firmly to the mast. It is evident that he"
8240,II.,"cannot control himself from within, he wishes to be loosed, but is only"
8241,II.,fastened the more tightly by his deafened associates. Foreseeing his
8242,II.,"own weakness he guards against it, yet brings out the more strongly his"
8243,II.,lack of self-mastery. He gives up his freedom in order not to perish
8244,II.,through enjoyment. Herein we find suggestive hints concerning the
8245,II.,"natural man; he must be governed from without, till he become"
8246,II.,self-governable. Truly this is the first stage both in the individual
8247,II.,"and in history, and Ulysses is the typical personality representing"
8248,II.,both.
8249,II.,
8250,II.,"The song of the Sirens is given, which we did not hear in the previous"
8251,II.,"prophetic portion. We may note in it touches of flattery, of"
8252,II.,"enticement, of boundless promises, even of wisdom for the wise man."
8253,II.,"Then that favorite theme, the Trojan War, they claim to know, ""and all"
8254,II.,"that has ever happened upon the foodful earth."" Such are the gorgeous"
8255,II.,promises to the man thirsty for knowledge; but mark in their meadow the
8256,II.,"bones and decaying bodies of dead men. Evidently their sweet song,"
8257,II.,"promising all, lures only to destroy. Their power, however, lasts but"
8258,II.,"for the moment, while the senses are tingled; when the fit is over,"
8259,II.,Ulysses is set free and he makes no attempt to return to them. Indeed
8260,II.,"another problem is upon him; he sees ""a great wave and mist,"" to which"
8261,II.,is added a loud sound of rushing waters. Again he exhorts his
8262,II.,companions and tells them all that he dares about the approaching
8263,II.,dangers.
8264,II.,
8265,II.,2. Now we are to witness a practical dealing with the Double
8266,II.,"Alternative, which was theoretically set forth in the previous portion."
8267,II.,"But the first Alternative, those bi-valvular rocks called Plangctæ,"
8268,II.,which clasped the sea-faring man between their valves and crushed him
8269,II.,"to death, is wholly avoided, is not even mentioned in the present"
8270,II.,"passage, though it is possibly implied in one place. At any rate the"
8271,II.,"grand stress is laid upon the second Alternative, Scylla and Charybdis,"
8272,II.,between which the ship is to pass.
8273,II.,
8274,II.,"Here again Ulysses shows his limitation. In spite of Circe's warning,"
8275,II.,"he puts on armor, takes two spears, and goes on deck, like a Homeric"
8276,II.,"hero, to fight Scylla. He tries to solve his problem externally, as he"
8277,II.,did in the case of the Sirens. In vain; he could not see his foe
8278,II.,"anywhere, and his eyes grew weary, peering about at the mist-like"
8279,II.,rocks.
8280,II.,
8281,II.,"Not thus was Scylla to be met, a monster not of mortal mould, hardly"
8282,II.,"attainable by the senses. Still she was present somehow, and made"
8283,II.,"herself valid. The whirling waters roared and seethed, all were intent"
8284,II.,"upon the maelstrom, Charybdis, the other side; ""we looked at her,"
8285,II.,"fearing destruction,"" and destruction came just from the direction in"
8286,II.,"which they were not looking. Scylla, watched, remains invisible;"
8287,II.,"unwatched, she appears and snaps up six companions; external weapons"
8288,II.,"can effect nothing against her. Still Ulysses gets through, scotched"
8289,II.,somewhat; he has failed to see both sides at one and the same time;
8290,II.,"mind, intelligence alone can rise out of the particular thing of the"
8291,II.,"senses, and grasp the two things in opposition. As we read the story"
8292,II.,"here, it suggests the man, the life-faring man, who is so drawn to one"
8293,II.,"part that he neglects the counterpart, which has equal validity and"
8294,II.,"soon makes itself felt by the penalty. Not the Alternative, then,"
8295,II.,"Scylla _or_ Charybdis, but the combined Scylla _and_ Charybdis is the"
8296,II.,"word of mastery. The two kept in separation destroy, the two held in"
8297,II.,unity are conquerable. Under all difference of Nature lies the
8298,II.,"Thought's oneness, which is the true synthesis of every Scylla and"
8299,II.,"Charybdis. Such is the experience of Ulysses now; the Sirens, the"
8300,II.,"creatures of the senses, may be thwarted by a species of external"
8301,II.,force; but not the present monsters can be so treated. The dualism
8302,II.,"exists doubtless, and we can be caught in it, but the function of mind"
8303,II.,"is to overspan it, and so transform all difference, discord, diabolism"
8304,II.,"into unity, harmony, deity."
8305,II.,
8306,II.,Thus Ulysses disobeys Circe's command not to attempt to fight Scylla
8307,II.,with weapons; the reason of her injunction becomes plain. Not a
8308,II.,"sensuous thing to be slain is Scylla, in spite of her animal figure;"
8309,II.,"the poet hints that she is to be encountered by mind, which must here"
8310,II.,see both sides at once and so assert its supremacy over both. To be
8311,II.,intent upon the one and disregard the other--that is the grand human
8312,II.,danger. Hence the thought of Scylla and Charybdis has passed into the
8313,II.,"literature of the world, nay into the proverbs of the people, to"
8314,II.,"express the peril of one-sidedness, as well as the inherent dualism in"
8315,II.,"all conduct. Moreover the golden mean is suggested, that principle of"
8316,II.,action so familiar in later Greek philosophy. Deeper than this golden
8317,II.,"mean, however, runs the idea here; the dialectic of existence, the"
8318,II.,"twofoldness which must be made one, the higher synthesis over all"
8319,II.,analysis are dimly intimated in the marvelous tale.
8320,II.,
8321,II.,"3. Having escaped through the two rocks, Ulysses and his companions"
8322,II.,"come to ""the flawless island of the Sun,"" the all-seeing luminary of"
8323,II.,Heaven. It is the total light beholding the totality. Is it not
8324,II.,"manifest that we have passed out of dualism into unity, out of strife"
8325,II.,"into harmony? The island is represented as pastoral, peaceful, idyllic,"
8326,II.,with its herds reposing in sunlight; certainly a decided contrast to
8327,II.,the noise and struggle in the region of Scylla and Charybdis. Or we may
8328,II.,give the matter a psychological turn and say: Such is the transition
8329,II.,from the Understanding with its finitude to Reason with its
8330,II.,"universality, to the all-seeing light within. Ulysses, having"
8331,II.,"transcended the limit he showed in his last experience, has gone"
8332,II.,forward to the clear sunlit realm which illumines all limitations.
8333,II.,
8334,II.,But just at this point danger arises. On the island are pasturing herds
8335,II.,"of oxen and sheep sacred to the Sun, things of light consecrated to"
8336,II.,light. The temptation will be to use them for the gratification of
8337,II.,"appetite, perhaps under some strong stress. Already both Tiresias and"
8338,II.,"Circe have given the warning, which Ulysses now repeats to his"
8339,II.,companions and even exacts an oath from them not to harm the holy
8340,II.,"flocks. But hunger pinches, Ulysses again goes to sleep at the wrong"
8341,II.,"moment, and the oxen of the Sun are slain by his men. It is true that"
8342,II.,"the test is a hard one, death by starvation is impending, and they"
8343,II.,"yield, not only violating their oaths but their light. Then they"
8344,II.,"defiantly repeated their deed, ""for six whole days they feasted,"
8345,II.,"selecting the best of the Sun's oxen."" When Ulysses awoke, he chid them"
8346,II.,"sternly, but did not, or could not, stop them. The result was, they"
8347,II.,perished.
8348,II.,
8349,II.,Already we have touched upon the physical basis which underlies this
8350,II.,tale. The symbolism we may consider somewhat more closely. The sin
8351,II.,against light on the part of the companions is double: they knew better
8352,II.,"because they had been forewarned, they were not ignorant as when they"
8353,II.,"opened the Bag of Winds. Secondly, they destroyed objects sacred to the"
8354,II.,"grand luminary, they assailed the very source of light. Ulysses has"
8355,II.,"shared in the act also, he too must take his part of the penalty. He is"
8356,II.,"saved, for he forbade the wrong, yet he went to sleep at the critical"
8357,II.,moment. To be sure the companions were hungry; but that is just the
8358,II.,"test; if they had had plenty to eat, there would have been no real"
8359,II.,trial of their fidelity to principle.
8360,II.,
8361,II.,"The ancient poet, throwing deepest glances into the soul and into the"
8362,II.,"world, beholds the supreme negative act of man, and seeks to clothe it"
8363,II.,"in a symbol. Mind turns against mind, when the man does what he knows"
8364,II.,"is wrong, and the destructive side is doubly re-inforced when he"
8365,II.,"assails light itself, and knowledge slays knowledge. When a person who"
8366,II.,"knows affirms in word and deed that his knowing is a lie, his light"
8367,II.,"puts out a light, he destroys the Oxen of the Sun. What then? It is no"
8368,II.,"wonder that the great luminary threatens ""to go down to Hades and there"
8369,II.,"shine among the dead,"" unless the full penalty is exacted for such a"
8370,II.,"deed. In fact, he is already extinguished mentally for these men, and"
8371,II.,"Zeus, voicing the world-order, can only hurry them off into darkness."
8372,II.,Very wonderful is the thought lurking in the symbolism of the old seer:
8373,II.,"intellectual negation, skepticism, denial, culminating in the negative"
8374,II.,"deed, will at last drive the Sun himself out of Heaven and send him"
8375,II.,"below into the Underworld. It is highly probable, however, that the"
8376,II.,"negative man will be sent down there first, as is done in the present"
8377,II.,case.
8378,II.,
8379,II.,"After slaying the Oxen of the Sun and repeating the offense many times,"
8380,II.,"Ulysses and his companions must again meet life, and accordingly they"
8381,II.,"set sail upon the sea, bound for home and country. But such men have"
8382,II.,"not in them the elements of the Return. Storms arise, winds blow, the"
8383,II.,"helmsman is killed by the falling mast, and the ship is struck by"
8384,II.,lightning. The destructive powers of nature seem to concentrate upon
8385,II.,"these destroyers; such is the decree of Zeus, carrying out his promise"
8386,II.,to the Sun; verily the Supreme God could not well do otherwise. Ulysses
8387,II.,alone barely saves himself upon a fragment of the mast and keel;
8388,II.,"manifestly there is a difference between him and his companions, who"
8389,II.,"disobeyed his order. The text says that ""the companions feasted for six"
8390,II.,"days,"" it would seem that he did not; still he is involved in their"
8391,II.,"calamity, though not fully in their guilt. Here is, then, a distinction"
8392,II.,"of importance, since upon it is based the saving of Ulysses, who is yet"
8393,II.,to have a career.
8394,II.,
8395,II.,"While Ulysses may not have personally participated in the guilty deed,"
8396,II.,"he was not active against it, he did not apparently seem to restrain"
8397,II.,"the repetitions of it, he was paralyzed in energy. It was his will"
8398,II.,"which was defective, not his intellect; he did not commit the offense,"
8399,II.,"but he did not stop it, and try to conciliate the wrath of the Gods by"
8400,II.,"sacrifices, by what we now call repentance. Hence, while he does not"
8401,II.,"perish, he is still unfinished, incomplete, with a limit to be removed."
8402,II.,"A training of the Will is to be gone through next, till it be able to"
8403,II.,do what Reason commands. A new discipline therefore is in store for the
8404,II.,Hero after the loss of his ship and his companions.
8405,II.,
8406,II.,What will this discipline be? To a degree his entire career must be
8407,II.,worked over again from the beginning. Upon his fragment of wood he
8408,II.,floats back to Scylla and Charybdis; he falls into the old dualism in
8409,II.,"one of its phases, for he cannot stay upon the Island of the Sun, the"
8410,II.,place of unity and rest and light. Indeed have we not just seen him in
8411,II.,"the fierce conflict between knowing and doing, which he has not been"
8412,II.,able to unify in the last adventure? So he drops back between the
8413,II.,"grinding mill-stones of two opposites; one of these opposites, the"
8414,II.,"maelstrom Charybdis, is sucking him in, but he clutches the branches of"
8415,II.,"a large fig-tree overhanging the whirlpool, and holds fast till his"
8416,II.,"mast and keel return to the surface of the water, upon which he"
8417,II.,escapes.
8418,II.,
8419,II.,One cannot help feeling that the poet in this description has a
8420,II.,"conscious meaning underneath, it is more or less allegorical. The will"
8421,II.,"of Ulysses was paralyzed in the Island of the Sun, he is helplessly"
8422,II.,"carried forward on the sea, till the yawning gulf of Charybdis"
8423,II.,"(Despair) threatens to swallow him, when he puts forth a mighty effort"
8424,II.,"of will, represented in his clinging to the branches of the fig tree,"
8425,II.,"which extends Hope to him, and thus he rescues himself. Now he rows his"
8426,II.,"raft ""with both his hands,"" it is indeed time to exert anew his"
8427,II.,"volition. Charybdis could not take him, on account of a saving germ in"
8428,II.,him still; she has to let him pass. Whither?
8429,II.,
8430,II.,"Naturally the next station rearward is that of the Sirens, and this in"
8431,II.,a general way is what Ulysses reaches in his relapse. He comes to the
8432,II.,"realm of the senses, for the fact is that this was the source of the"
8433,II.,"great trouble in the Island of the Sun. The companions, pressed by"
8434,II.,"appetite and the needs of the body, yielded up their conviction, their"
8435,II.,intelligence; they had not reached that strength of the spirit which
8436,II.,prefers the death of the body to a surrender of the soul. Ulysses at
8437,II.,"last acquiesced, the problem was too great for him and so he also is"
8438,II.,cast out of the Island of the Sun back into the region of the senses.
8439,II.,"But it is a new region of the senses, not that of the Sirens, not that"
8440,II.,"of Circe, both of which he has transcended by an effort of will-power;"
8441,II.,"it is the realm of Calypso, the Concealer, which has been reached"
8442,II.,through the collapse of the will after the sin against light. There is
8443,II.,"unquestionably an affinity between Circe, the Sirens, and Calypso, yet"
8444,II.,there is also such a difference between them that the poet has assigned
8445,II.,"to them distinct domains, It is plain, too, that Ulysses in his present"
8446,II.,"paralysis will remain long with Calypso, not at once will he recover"
8447,II.,"his power after such a negation. He is hidden, as it were, in her Dark"
8448,II.,Island Ogygia after that undoing of light; he passes from the sun-world
8449,II.,"of Reason to its opposite. Calypso, therefore, is reached through the"
8450,II.,"grand Relapse, not through the progressive movement, which we have seen"
8451,II.,him going through hitherto.
8452,II.,
8453,II.,"Still Ulysses has in him the germ of betterment, of salvation. He longs"
8454,II.,"to reach home and country, to return to his institutional world; that"
8455,II.,spark of aspiration has a saving power; it will not be extinguished
8456,II.,even in the sensuous delights of Calypso's bower.
8457,II.,
8458,II.,_Observations._ In looking back at the Twelfth Book and thinking it
8459,II.,"over as a Whole, the reader will always feel that he has not fully"
8460,II.,sounded its depths. It has not exercised so great an influence upon
8461,II.,"mankind as the Eleventh Book, but it is probably profounder. It lures"
8462,II.,"specially the thinker and the psychologist, it seems not only to set"
8463,II.,forth thought but the thought of thought. Very difficult is the poetic
8464,II.,"problem in such a case, the imaginative form really is driven to its"
8465,II.,utmost limit in order to express the content.
8466,II.,
8467,II.,I. The first thing to be fully grasped and thoroughly studied is the
8468,II.,structure of the Book. For structure is the primordial fact of any
8469,II.,"work, and especially of any great work, structure has always its own"
8470,II.,"meaning and far-reaching suggestiveness, and it points directly to what"
8471,II.,"the Book signifies, being its inner vital organism. In the Twelfth Book"
8472,II.,we shall ponder a little the three essential facts of its structure.
8473,II.,
8474,II.,"(1) There is the twofold division of the Book, while the other Books of"
8475,II.,Fableland have distinctly a threefold division. Herewith is coupled the
8476,II.,duplication of its content; the second part repeats what is contained
8477,II.,in the first part; or the first part tells in advance what is to be
8478,II.,done in the second part. Thus the structure images dualism: Thought and
8479,II.,"Action, Word and Deed, Idea and Reality, Prophecy and Fulfillment. Yet"
8480,II.,it also hints the oneness in the dualism.
8481,II.,
8482,II.,(2) The next point in structure is the threefold subdivision of each of
8483,II.,"the two parts. That is, now the structural principle falls back into"
8484,II.,that of the preceding Books of Fableland. Each part has its three main
8485,II.,"adventures with their respective environments and shapes, quite as each"
8486,II.,Book hitherto has had. What does this suggest to the reader--this
8487,II.,duplication of the threefold form of the Book?
8488,II.,
8489,II.,"(3) Finally comes the very peculiar structure of the second adventure,"
8490,II.,which we have above called the Double Alternative. The dualism of the
8491,II.,"Book we may say, is now doubled, and transformed into the middle one of"
8492,II.,the three grand trials or exploits which the Hero has to pass through.
8493,II.,"The monster Scylla is here to be noted, with its six necks and heads,"
8494,II.,"three on each side of the body, wherein again the triple is duplicated,"
8495,II.,though the body is certainly one. It was this monster which did most
8496,II.,"harm to Ulysses, snapping up six of his companions in the passage."
8497,II.,
8498,II.,"Such are the main points in the structure of the present Book,"
8499,II.,"assuredly as great a marvel as anything recorded in the same, when it"
8500,II.,is once fully beheld. That it is intimately connected with the thought
8501,II.,"of the Book, is indeed the very form and mould thereof, is felt by"
8502,II.,every careful reader. But what is this thought? Here the difference
8503,II.,"begins, and the conflict of opinion ranges over and into fields diverse"
8504,II.,and far apart.
8505,II.,
8506,II.,II. It may be said that the interpretations suggested by these three
8507,II.,"adventures--with the Sirens, with Scylla and Charybdis, and with the"
8508,II.,Oxen of the Sun--belong to two extremes; those of Nature and of Mind.
8509,II.,Readers and commentators of different character and training will
8510,II.,"differ; one set will lean to the physical view, the other to the"
8511,II.,spiritual. It is our opinion that both views can find justification in
8512,II.,the poem. We may first look at the physical interpretation.
8513,II.,
8514,II.,All these monsters have been supposed to represent perils of
8515,II.,"navigation, especially in the Italian seas, which were frequented by"
8516,II.,"the early Greek navigator. They have also been located geographically,"
8517,II.,to be sure in a variety of places. The Sirens dwelt on three dangerous
8518,II.,"rocks near the island of Capræa, according to ancient authorities; or"
8519,II.,"they were found on the promontory between Pæstum and Elea, or even down"
8520,II.,at Cape Pelorum in Sicily. Why should they not be indeed everywhere!
8521,II.,Then they have been supposed to personify the secret dangers of a calm
8522,II.,"sea, and their song is the music of splashing waters. Undoubtedly a"
8523,II.,"physical substrate must be granted in the case of the Sirens, and in"
8524,II.,"the Mythus generally; still they are truly everywhere, not only in the"
8525,II.,"Italian Sea, but also in the sea of life, and they appear not only to"
8526,II.,the professional sailor but to every human navigator. Are literal rocks
8527,II.,passed by putting wax into the ears of the crew and by tying the
8528,II.,captain to the mast? Surely some other peril is suggested.
8529,II.,
8530,II.,"In the second adventure, the Plangctæ (the Claspers, not the Wanderers,"
8531,II.,"as some translations give it), have been located at the Lipari Islands"
8532,II.,"in the Sicilian Sea, where there is strong volcanic action. The"
8533,II.,well-known Symplegades of the Argonautic expedition which were placed
8534,II.,"at the entrance of the Euxine, were probably patterned after this"
8535,II.,"Homeric conception, and transferred to the North-east. The two terrors,"
8536,II.,"Scylla and Charybdis, lie in the straits of Messina, according to the"
8537,II.,"accepted view, the former on the Italian side, the latter on the"
8538,II.,"Sicilian. A town named Scilla still exists in those regions, and an"
8539,II.,eddy in the straits of Messina is still called Charilla (from Charybdis
8540,II.,"doubtless.) Etymologically Scylla means a bitch, Charybdis is allied"
8541,II.,with Chaos (from a Greek word meaning to yawn). Later legend gave to
8542,II.,"Scylla a great variety of forms, which were reproduced in art and"
8543,II.,poetry. One story represents her as having been a beautiful maiden who
8544,II.,"was loved by Glaucus, and who was turned into her present monstrous"
8545,II.,"shape by Circe through jealousy, for the enchantress loved Glaucus too."
8546,II.,"The sucking-in of the waters by Charybdis, and her disgorging of them"
8547,II.,has been connected with the ebb and flow of the tides. It may also be
8548,II.,added that the Plangctæ (in the sense of wandering or floating islands)
8549,II.,"have been supposed to refer to icebergs, some report of which may have"
8550,II.,"reached the Homeric world through the Phoenician sailor, who must"
8551,II.,"have passed outside of the straits of Gibraltar, into the Atlantic."
8552,II.,
8553,II.,III. Such are some of the physical explanations which this Book has
8554,II.,suggested; we may now consider it in relation to certain mental
8555,II.,phenomena. Already we have unfolded the ethical meaning which
8556,II.,"especially lies in these shapes, and the Hero's struggle with them. But"
8557,II.,they have another and deeper suggestion; they adumbrate the nature of
8558,II.,mind itself and the process of thinking; both in form and content the
8559,II.,"whole Book strangely points to psychology, as if the poet, having"
8560,II.,"created these wonders of Fableland, were going to create his own"
8561,II.,creative act and present it in an image.
8562,II.,
8563,II.,(1) The division of the Book into the two parts already alluded to in
8564,II.,"which each is what the other is, in which there are both separation and"
8565,II.,"identity, calls up the fundamental fact of self-consciousness, which is"
8566,II.,"often expressed in the formula Ego=Ego. Mind, Ego, separates itself"
8567,II.,"into two sides, yet each side is the whole and recognizes the other"
8568,II.,"side as itself. This act is the condition of knowing of every kind,"
8569,II.,which always differentiates then identifies. One step more: Circe in
8570,II.,"her prophecy gave the pure form of the idea, then came its realization,"
8571,II.,so that there is suggested the primordial distinction of the mind into
8572,II.,"Intellect and Will, or the Thought and the Deed. Thus we see in this"
8573,II.,division of the Twelfth Book the exact characteristic of
8574,II.,"subject-object, and there is still further suggested the distinction"
8575,II.,between Thinking and Willing.
8576,II.,
8577,II.,"(2) Passing to the threefold subdivision of each of the two parts, we"
8578,II.,observe that it also calls up psychological distinctions. Three stages
8579,II.,"of the knowing mind, Senses, Understanding, Reason, may be found here,"
8580,II.,"not very definitely given, still distinctly implied. The Sirens"
8581,II.,"represent the Sensuous, especially in its moral aspect; the Plangctæ"
8582,II.,with Scylla and Charybdis set forth a vivid image of the divisions and
8583,II.,conflicts of the finite Understanding; the Oxen of the Sun point to the
8584,II.,"central light, that of Reason, which, when destroyed in any way,"
8585,II.,constitutes the chief human calamity.
8586,II.,
8587,II.,Another curious psychological hint may be noted in the text of Homer.
8588,II.,"The Sirens, the first or implicit stage, are sometimes spoken of in the"
8589,II.,dual and sometimes in the plural; Homer would seem to imply that they
8590,II.,"are two in number, yet they always act and sing as one. That is, the"
8591,II.,dualism or separation is as yet implicit; but in the second stage (that
8592,II.,of Scylla and Charybdis) it will become explicit with decided emphasis.
8593,II.,"Later legend made the Sirens three in number, and gave them names, and"
8594,II.,otherwise distinguished them; but this is not Homeric and indeed has
8595,II.,lost the Homeric consciousness.
8596,II.,
8597,II.,(3) The fact that the previous Books of Fableland have a threefold
8598,II.,"division only, while this threefold division is duplicated in the"
8599,II.,"Twelfth Book, has also its psychological bearing in connection with the"
8600,II.,"foregoing views. In the first case, the poet was not aware of his"
8601,II.,"process, he yielded to the poetic act immediately; but in the second"
8602,II.,"case, he is conscious, he knows his own process and prefigures it; he"
8603,II.,"holds it up before himself in advance, just as Circe holds up before"
8604,II.,"Ulysses his future career. Ulysses also must know in advance, hitherto"
8605,II.,"he has simply followed instinct and chance, whithersoever they led. In"
8606,II.,"like manner, the poet now shows himself knowing what he will do; his"
8607,II.,"threefold organic movement, hitherto more or less implicit and"
8608,II.,"unconscious, has become explicit and conscious, and can be prophesied."
8609,II.,He himself thus is an example of the Ego which both casts before and
8610,II.,"forecasts itself, in other words is self-duplicated."
8611,II.,
8612,II.,"(4) Here, however, we must note a distinction. In all four Books of"
8613,II.,"Fableland, Ulysses is the poet himself in a sense, he is singing his"
8614,II.,"own adventures to the Court of Phæacia, he is well aware of what he has"
8615,II.,passed through and to what he has come.
8616,II.,
8617,II.,He is not a Demodocus chanting heroic strains of the Trojan Past; he is
8618,II.,Ulysses telling his own spiritual experiences after the taking of Troy.
8619,II.,"It has been already unfolded (p. 246-7) that he was in a negative,"
8620,II.,alienated condition; he had fallen out with and was separated from his
8621,II.,"Hellenic world, whereof this Fableland is the record. But he arrives at"
8622,II.,"Phæacia, an harmonious institutional realm, then he becomes fully"
8623,II.,conscious of his negative condition and projects it out of himself in
8624,II.,these Tales or Songs. So all Fableland shows this consciousness in the
8625,II.,man; but the Twelfth Book shows him conscious not only of his negative
8626,II.,"state, but of his mental process, conscious of his consciousness, we"
8627,II.,"may say; he is not only Thought, but is Thought thinking Thought, or at"
8628,II.,"least imaging the same; that is, Thought has itself as its own object"
8629,II.,or content. So much we are inclined to find hinted in this duplication
8630,II.,of the movement in the Twelfth Book.
8631,II.,
8632,II.,At this point we hear the cry of dissent: You make Homer too
8633,II.,"introspective, you make him a self-introverted, self-torturing"
8634,II.,"nineteenth century man, whereas he is the most unreflective,"
8635,II.,"unconscious of poets. Very natural is such a protest, my good reader;"
8636,II.,"this sort of thing may be carried too far, and become fantastic. Still"
8637,II.,it is a great mistake to think that Homer never takes a glance at his
8638,II.,own mind and its workings. He must have looked within in order to see
8639,II.,his world; where else was it to be found in any such completeness? He
8640,II.,"has built it, and he must have taken some interest in the architect and"
8641,II.,in his processes. Homer himself is a greater wonder than any wonder he
8642,II.,"has created, and he probably knew it."
8643,II.,
8644,II.,It is by no means the purpose to affirm in the preceding remarks that
8645,II.,"Homer intended to make an allegorical psychology. He simply had a mind,"
8646,II.,and the essence of mind is to be able to look at mind. So Homer saw
8647,II.,"himself and his own process, and set it forth in an imaginative form."
8648,II.,Very similar is the plan of Shakespeare in the _Tempest_. Prospero is
8649,II.,"the poet, not only as poet, but the poet making his drama in the drama."
8650,II.,There is also a significant duplication both of structure and
8651,II.,"character: Prospero is at one time magician, that is, poet, and"
8652,II.,"commands the elements and the spirits, especially Ariel; at another"
8653,II.,"time he assumes his ordinary relations as parent and as king, and is as"
8654,II.,"limited as other mortals. Shakespeare made many dramas, then he saw"
8655,II.,"himself making dramas, then he put into a drama himself making dramas."
8656,II.,"That is, he in the end (Tempest is usually held to be the last of"
8657,II.,"Shakespeare's plays) took up his own poetic process into a poem, and"
8658,II.,thus completed the arch of his great career.
8659,II.,
8660,II.,So much for the psychological aspect of these Books of Fableland. It
8661,II.,"must be stated again that abstract terms, so necessary for an exact"
8662,II.,"science of mind, had not been elaborated to any extent in Homer's day."
8663,II.,Reflective language is a later product of Greek spirit. Still the
8664,II.,"philosopher is anticipated and prophesied in the poet, and it certainly"
8665,II.,cannot be amiss to trace vague premonitions and promises of the coming
8666,II.,Plato and Aristotle in the old poet. Homer has in him the germ of the
8667,II.,"whole Greek world, and for that matter, much of the modern world also;"
8668,II.,the best commentary upon him is the 2500 years since his time.
8669,II.,
8670,II.,IV. The slaying of the Oxen of the Sun has also its searching
8671,II.,"suggestiveness, and is found in one form or other in the World's"
8672,II.,greatest Books. Mind destroying mind may be shown as light
8673,II.,extinguishing its own luminary; some such hint lies in the symbolism
8674,II.,both of the act and its punishment. It is indeed the culminating point
8675,II.,of negation--spirit denying spirit. This is the real sin against the
8676,II.,"Holy Spirit, unpardonable because repentance, all possibility of pardon"
8677,II.,"is denied by the doer of the deed. As I understand him, this is the"
8678,II.,"essence of the sin of Dante against Beatrice, with which she reproaches"
8679,II.,him in the last part of the Purgatorio. Suggestions of the same kind of
8680,II.,guilt may be found in the characters of Shakespeare's Hamlet and
8681,II.,"Banquo, in whose cases the violation brings on a tragic fate; indeed"
8682,II.,every true tragedy has some touches of the light-denying or
8683,II.,light-defying deed and its penalty. Above all rises in this respect the
8684,II.,"Faust of Goethe, the theme of which is explicitly intelligence denying"
8685,II.,"intelligence, whereby the human mind becomes utterly negative, begets"
8686,II.,"the Devil, and enters into compact with him for a life of indulgence."
8687,II.,"While such a state lasts, repentance is impossible."
8688,II.,
8689,II.,"Some such intimation ancient Homer must have had, and shadowed it forth"
8690,II.,in this strange symbolic deed. Ulysses having disregarded all he had
8691,II.,"learned by his long and bitter experience, leaving unheeded the"
8692,II.,warnings and prophecies of the Supersensible and the Sensible World
8693,II.,"(Tiresias and Circe), drops back into the sphere of Calypso, and has to"
8694,II.,serve the senses seven years till will and aspiration lift him again.
8695,II.,"Such a servitude was not uncommon in Greek legend, Hercules is the very"
8696,II.,"embodiment thereof; even a God, Apollo, Light itself, has to serve"
8697,II.,"Admetus, a mortal, in expiation of undivine guilt."
8698,II.,
8699,II.,An important element of structure is to be noted at this point: the
8700,II.,poem bifurcates and the reader has to move in two directions. If he
8701,II.,"wishes to follow the development of Ulysses, (which is indispensable)"
8702,II.,he must return with the latter to Calypso's Island and trace him
8703,II.,"through his three grand experiences--Oyggia, Phæacia, and Fableland."
8704,II.,"But if the reader wishes to continue in the action of the poem, he must"
8705,II.,now pass out of Fableland to Ithaca in the company of the Hero. (For
8706,II.,"this double movement of the Ulyssiad, see pp. 121-8.)"
8707,II.,
8708,II.,"But before Fableland is left behind, its full sweep may be called up"
8709,II.,"once more: from the Upperworld of Earth (Ninth and Tenth Books, both"
8710,II.,"belong together in a general survey), which shows the negation of Greek"
8711,II.,"ethical life and its conflicts, we pass to the Underworld of Hades,"
8712,II.,"which on the one hand is the negation of all Greek sensible existence,"
8713,II.,"and on the other hand is the revelation of the supersensible (soul,"
8714,II.,"idea, world-justice); thence we come back to the Upperworld in which"
8715,II.,"the idea, obtained beyond, is seen struggling with the reality in"
8716,II.,"various negative phases--Ulysses, knowing in advance, is shown in his"
8717,II.,"attempt to realize his knowledge in the deed. Such then, is this grand"
8718,II.,threefold sweep of Fableland.
8719,II.,
8720,II.,"One more retrospect: let us glance back at the whole Twelve Books, this"
8721,II.,"first half of the Odyssey, composed of the Telemachiad and the"
8722,II.,Ulyssiad. Both are parts of one whole; father and son acquire each his
8723,II.,special discipline for the coming deed. Both are brought to a
8724,II.,"recognition of the Divine Order, the son mainly through tradition, the"
8725,II.,father mainly through experience. Both reach beyond the sensible into
8726,II.,the supersensible or ideal realm; Telemachus hears the story of
8727,II.,"Proteus, which teaches the essence in all appearance; Ulysses descends"
8728,II.,to Hades and there communes with pure mind without its terrestrial
8729,II.,"incumbrance, in the case of Tiresias and others. Such is the internal"
8730,II.,"preparation; now they are to do the deed. The idea they possess, the"
8731,II.,next is to make it real.
8732,II.,
8733,II.,"Accordingly the action of the poem, with Ulysses as its center, moves"
8734,II.,"next to Ithaca, the realm in which the idea is to be realized:"
8735,II.,wherewith we enter upon a new grand division of the poem.
8736,II.,
8737,II.,(The reader who wishes to study the parallelism between this Twelfth
8738,II.,"Book and Prospero can consult the author's Commentary on Shakespeare,"
8739,II.,"where it treats of the _Tempest_. In fact, the entire play, which is"
8740,II.,"also a kind of Fairy Tale, has many correspondences with Homer's"
8741,II.,Fableland.)

8746,_ITHAKEIAD._,_ITHAKEIAD._
8747,_ITHAKEIAD._,
8748,_ITHAKEIAD._,
8749,_ITHAKEIAD._,Such is the designation which we have concluded to give to the last
8750,_ITHAKEIAD._,"twelve Books of the Odyssey, inasmuch as a name is needed for this"
8751,_ITHAKEIAD._,portion corresponding to the Telemachiad and the Ulyssiad. The scene is
8752,_ITHAKEIAD._,"laid wholly in Ithaca, the characters of the poem are all brought"
8753,_ITHAKEIAD._,"together, and the main conflict takes place. It is the country which is"
8754,_ITHAKEIAD._,to be cleansed of violence and guilt; that Divine Order which father
8755,_ITHAKEIAD._,"and son have learned about, each in his own way, they must now make"
8756,_ITHAKEIAD._,"real in the world, especially in their own land. Manifestly Ithaca"
8757,_ITHAKEIAD._,"represents the realm of wrong, of hostility to the social system of"
8758,_ITHAKEIAD._,"man; the Suitors defy Law, Family, State, Gods."
8759,_ITHAKEIAD._,
8760,_ITHAKEIAD._,"But Ulysses, before he can reform his country, has had to reform"
8761,_ITHAKEIAD._,"himself. When he attacked the Ciconians, he was as negative to"
8762,_ITHAKEIAD._,institutional order as the Suitors themselves; he was not the man to
8763,_ITHAKEIAD._,"destroy them at that time, he was too like them to undo their work."
8764,_ITHAKEIAD._,"Hence the long discipline in Fableland, which has been fully explained"
8765,_ITHAKEIAD._,"in the preceding comments; hence too he had to see Phæacia, the ideal"
8766,_ITHAKEIAD._,"institutional life realized in Family and State, as well as in Industry"
8767,_ITHAKEIAD._,"and the Fine Arts. Let the reader note that he passes, not from"
8768,_ITHAKEIAD._,"Fableland, but from Phæacia, to Ithaca; having that Phæacian Idea in"
8769,_ITHAKEIAD._,"his soul, he can transform his own country. Thus he will truly save his"
8770,_ITHAKEIAD._,"companions, namely, the people, whom before he lost in Fableland."
8771,_ITHAKEIAD._,
8772,_ITHAKEIAD._,Telemachus also in his training has seen much and brought back an ideal
8773,_ITHAKEIAD._,with him. He has heard the wise man Nestor and witnessed the religious
8774,_ITHAKEIAD._,"life of Hellas in its highest manifestation. Pylos, Nestor's kingdom,"
8775,_ITHAKEIAD._,is almost a Greek theocracy; the Gods appear visible at the feasts and
8776,_ITHAKEIAD._,hold communion with the people. Likewise at Sparta Telemachus saw a
8777,_ITHAKEIAD._,"realm of peace and concord, in striking contrast with his own Ithaca;"
8778,_ITHAKEIAD._,"but chiefly he heard the Marvelous Tale of Proteus, after which he was"
8779,_ITHAKEIAD._,eager to return home at once. Thus he too has had his experience of a
8780,_ITHAKEIAD._,"social order, as well as his ideal instruction. Previous to his journey"
8781,_ITHAKEIAD._,"he had shown a tendency to despair, and to a denial of the Gods on"
8782,_ITHAKEIAD._,account of the disorders of the Suitors in his house. Unquestionably he
8783,_ITHAKEIAD._,"comes back to Ithaca with renewed courage and aspiration, and with an"
8784,_ITHAKEIAD._,"ideal in his soul, which makes him a meet companion for his father."
8785,_ITHAKEIAD._,
8786,_ITHAKEIAD._,The third character is the swineherd Eumæus who is the great addition
8787,_ITHAKEIAD._,"in this portion of the Odyssey. He too has had his discipline, which is"
8788,_ITHAKEIAD._,to be recounted here; he has been stolen as a child and sold into
8789,_ITHAKEIAD._,slavery; still the most terrible calamities to himself and his master
8790,_ITHAKEIAD._,"and to the House of Ulysses, have not shaken his fealty to the Gods."
8791,_ITHAKEIAD._,Thus in common with Telemachus and Ulysses he has faith in the Divine
8792,_ITHAKEIAD._,"Order, and can cooperate with them in realizing the same in Ithaca."
8793,_ITHAKEIAD._,"Very different has been his discipline from that of the other two, both"
8794,_ITHAKEIAD._,"of whom became negative and had to be sent away from home for training,"
8795,_ITHAKEIAD._,but Eumæus has remained in his hut and never swerved in his fidelity to
8796,_ITHAKEIAD._,"his sovereigns above and below, though he does not understand the"
8797,_ITHAKEIAD._,providential reason for so much wrong and suffering.
8798,_ITHAKEIAD._,
8799,_ITHAKEIAD._,"To these three men we are to add the woman, Penelope, who has her part,"
8800,_ITHAKEIAD._,perhaps the most difficult in this difficult business. She cannot
8801,_ITHAKEIAD._,"resort to violence, she must use her feminine weapon, tact, with a"
8802,_ITHAKEIAD._,degree of skill which makes her an example for all time. Indeed not a
8803,_ITHAKEIAD._,"few of her sex declare that she has overdone the matter, and that her"
8804,_ITHAKEIAD._,acts are morally questionable. But there can be no doubt that it is the
8805,_ITHAKEIAD._,"part of tact to find fault with tact, and that woman will always decry"
8806,_ITHAKEIAD._,"woman's skill in artifice, without refraining from its employment"
8807,_ITHAKEIAD._,altogether; indeed just that is a part of the artifice.
8808,_ITHAKEIAD._,
8809,_ITHAKEIAD._,For this and similar reasons the moral bearings of this portion of the
8810,_ITHAKEIAD._,"Odyssey have always aroused discussion. In general, the question comes"
8811,_ITHAKEIAD._,up: What constitutes a lie? Is the disguise of Ulysses justifiable? Is
8812,_ITHAKEIAD._,the subtlety of Penelope morally reprehensible? The old dispute as to
8813,_ITHAKEIAD._,conduct rises in full intensity: Does the end justify the means? Two
8814,_ITHAKEIAD._,"parties are sure to appear with views just opposite; the one excuses,"
8815,_ITHAKEIAD._,"the other condemns, often with no little asperity. The Odyssey has been"
8816,_ITHAKEIAD._,denounced even as an immoral Book and both its hero and heroine have
8817,_ITHAKEIAD._,been subjected to a burning ordeal of literary damnation.
8818,_ITHAKEIAD._,
8819,_ITHAKEIAD._,"The poet has, however, his wrongful set, the Suitors, about whose"
8820,_ITHAKEIAD._,character there is no disagreement. They are the negation of that
8821,_ITHAKEIAD._,Divine Order which is to be restored by those who believe in it--the
8822,_ITHAKEIAD._,"three men who come together at the hut of the swineherd, and who have"
8823,_ITHAKEIAD._,been trained by the time and circumstances just to this end. Ulysses
8824,_ITHAKEIAD._,has had to pass through his negative period and overcome the same
8825,_ITHAKEIAD._,within; now he is prepared to meet the Suitors and to destroy them
8826,_ITHAKEIAD._,without the negative recoil which came upon him after destroying the
8827,_ITHAKEIAD._,city of Troy. He can do a necessary deed of violence without becoming
8828,_ITHAKEIAD._,violent and destructive himself; he will not now re-enact the Ciconian
8829,_ITHAKEIAD._,affair.
8830,_ITHAKEIAD._,
8831,_ITHAKEIAD._,Let us look into the inner movement of the matter here indicated. The
8832,_ITHAKEIAD._,"slaughter of the Suitors by Ulysses was undoubtedly a negative act, yet"
8833,_ITHAKEIAD._,"the Suitors also were negative in conduct, wholly so; thus violence is"
8834,_ITHAKEIAD._,"met and undone by violence, or negation negates negation. What is the"
8835,_ITHAKEIAD._,outcome? Manifestly a double result is possible: if a negative cancels
8836,_ITHAKEIAD._,"a negative, there may remain still negation, or there may be a positive"
8837,_ITHAKEIAD._,result. Ulysses has passed through the first of these stages by his
8838,_ITHAKEIAD._,"discipline already recorded, after which he is master of the negative;"
8839,_ITHAKEIAD._,"the destruction of the Suitors will not now make him destructive, as"
8840,_ITHAKEIAD._,"did the destruction of Troy. It will be seen, therefore, that the poem"
8841,_ITHAKEIAD._,"has a positive outcome; after some trouble, Ulysses will renovate the"
8842,_ITHAKEIAD._,"country, will restore Family and State, in fine the whole Order which"
8843,_ITHAKEIAD._,had been upset by the Suitors.
8844,_ITHAKEIAD._,
8845,_ITHAKEIAD._,With the transition from Fableland occurs a marked change in the style
8846,_ITHAKEIAD._,of the poem. In the previous portions we have already noted the
8847,_ITHAKEIAD._,"Marvelous Tale of Fairyland, the Heroic Tale of Troy, the Idyllic"
8848,_ITHAKEIAD._,"Epopee of the Present, the latter especially in Phæacia. But in these"
8849,_ITHAKEIAD._,"last twelve Books we read a story of actual social life, a story which"
8850,_ITHAKEIAD._,almost strikes into the domain of the modern Novel. Still fabulous
8851,_ITHAKEIAD._,adventures will be interwoven--now more in the form of the
8852,_ITHAKEIAD._,novelette--with Phoenician and Egyptian backgrounds. Also a tone of
8853,_ITHAKEIAD._,"humanity, even of sentiment, makes itself felt in various places. A new"
8854,_ITHAKEIAD._,"situation brings with it a new style, yet Homeric still. Hereafter"
8855,_ITHAKEIAD._,these points will be more fully noticed.
8856,_ITHAKEIAD._,
8857,_ITHAKEIAD._,We have already indicated the fact (p. 19) that Pallas starts to
8858,_ITHAKEIAD._,"organize the Odyssey in Book First. Two portions she designates, the"
8859,_ITHAKEIAD._,"Telemachiad and the Ulyssiad, which really belong together, showing the"
8860,_ITHAKEIAD._,"spiritual palingenesis, or internal renovation of son and father ere"
8861,_ITHAKEIAD._,they proceed to the renovation of their country. Such in general are
8862,_ITHAKEIAD._,"the first twelve Books, showing the two masters of destiny, the two"
8863,_ITHAKEIAD._,positive men with their idea; the second twelve Books show them
8864,_ITHAKEIAD._,"realizing their idea, and doing the great deed for which they have been"
8865,_ITHAKEIAD._,prepared.
8866,_ITHAKEIAD._,
8867,_ITHAKEIAD._,This second half of the Odyssey falls into two divisions. The first is
8868,_ITHAKEIAD._,"located at the hut of the swineherd and brings the three men together,"
8869,_ITHAKEIAD._,whose general character has been already indicated; they have been
8870,_ITHAKEIAD._,trained by life to a living realization of the Divine Order. This
8871,_ITHAKEIAD._,division consists of four Books (XIII-XVI). The second division
8872,_ITHAKEIAD._,"transfers the scene from country to town, from hut to palace. Ulysses"
8873,_ITHAKEIAD._,in disguise will witness personally the full course of the wrong of the
8874,_ITHAKEIAD._,"suitors, against his property, his family, his state, and against the"
8875,_ITHAKEIAD._,Gods. Then he becomes the minister of the world-justice which he has
8876,_ITHAKEIAD._,already seen in Hades. Finally he harmonizes the distracted
8877,_ITHAKEIAD._,institutional life of his country and the poem ends. This second
8878,_ITHAKEIAD._,"division embraces the last eight Books, and has its own special stages"
8879,_ITHAKEIAD._,in its movement.
8880,_ITHAKEIAD._,
8881,_ITHAKEIAD._,_Survey of Books Thirteenth to Sixteenth._ In this portion we are to
8882,_ITHAKEIAD._,"witness the leading transition of the poem, that of Ulysses and"
8883,_ITHAKEIAD._,"Telemachus to Ithaca, the transition from the long and elaborate"
8884,_ITHAKEIAD._,"preparation for the act to the act itself, which is the supreme one of"
8885,_ITHAKEIAD._,"man, that of asserting and realizing the Divine Order. In these four"
8886,_ITHAKEIAD._,Books is the gathering of the chosen forces into one spot and into one
8887,_ITHAKEIAD._,purpose--which forces have been hitherto separately developed; here it
8888,_ITHAKEIAD._,is that we behold the practical preliminary movement for destroying the
8889,_ITHAKEIAD._,Suitors. Hence arises the feeling which most readers express on a
8890,_ITHAKEIAD._,"sympathetic perusal, that these four Books of the Ithakeiad, which is"
8891,_ITHAKEIAD._,"the name already given to the present division of the Odyssey, have"
8892,_ITHAKEIAD._,enough in common to cause them to be grouped together in an organic
8893,_ITHAKEIAD._,"survey of the poem. They have, first of all, unity of locality--the hut"
8894,_ITHAKEIAD._,"of the swineherd--to which, round which, and from which their incidents"
8895,_ITHAKEIAD._,"move. To be sure there is a glance at the enemy, the Suitors, who are"
8896,_ITHAKEIAD._,at a different point; but even this glance serves to emphasize the
8897,_ITHAKEIAD._,"setting common to these four Books, which is the abode of Eumæus. Very"
8898,_ITHAKEIAD._,"humble it is, but it stands in every way as the contrast to the palace."
8899,_ITHAKEIAD._,
8900,_ITHAKEIAD._,This unity of place naturally suggests unity of action as to what is
8901,_ITHAKEIAD._,going on in that place. All the forces in opposition to the Suitors are
8902,_ITHAKEIAD._,secretly gathering there and organizing. It is the center of attraction
8903,_ITHAKEIAD._,which is drawing out of the universe every atom of congenial energy for
8904,_ITHAKEIAD._,"punishing the transgressors. It has brought Ulysses from Phæacia,"
8905,_ITHAKEIAD._,"Telemachus from Sparta, and possesses already the faithful Eumæus in"
8906,_ITHAKEIAD._,"its own right. This is the fortress, and these are the three men who"
8907,_ITHAKEIAD._,make the attacking army. They are now getting themselves together. All
8908,_ITHAKEIAD._,"three have passed through a grand discipline just for the present end,"
8909,_ITHAKEIAD._,which is to be the great deed of deliverance.
8910,_ITHAKEIAD._,
8911,_ITHAKEIAD._,"Moreover the place has a character of its own, a peculiar atmosphere in"
8912,_ITHAKEIAD._,"sympathy with its purpose. Its strength we feel, its adamantine"
8913,_ITHAKEIAD._,fidelity to the House of Ulysses. It is a secluded spot in contrast to
8914,_ITHAKEIAD._,the palace; its occupant is a slave in contrast to the kings who are
8915,_ITHAKEIAD._,suitors; his business is to be the companion of swine in contrast to
8916,_ITHAKEIAD._,the regal entertainment at court. The highest and the humblest of the
8917,_ITHAKEIAD._,social order are here placed side by side; with what result? The
8918,_ITHAKEIAD._,unswerving rock of loyalty is the hut and the heart of the swineherd;
8919,_ITHAKEIAD._,upon it as the foundation the shattered institutional world of Ithaca
8920,_ITHAKEIAD._,"is to be rebuilt. The lowest class of society is, after all, the basis"
8921,_ITHAKEIAD._,"of the edifice; if it remain sound, then the superstructure can be"
8922,_ITHAKEIAD._,erected again after the fiery purification. But if it be utterly
8923,_ITHAKEIAD._,"rotten, what then? Such, however, is not the case in Ithaca, as long as"
8924,_ITHAKEIAD._,"there exists a man like the swineherd. From his rock, then, and, still"
8925,_ITHAKEIAD._,"more, from his spirit, is to issue the energy which is to transform"
8926,_ITHAKEIAD._,that perverted land of Ithaca.
8927,_ITHAKEIAD._,
8928,_ITHAKEIAD._,"Still, here too Ulysses is the pivot, the central character; the hero"
8929,_ITHAKEIAD._,"both in thought and action, for whom Eumæus furnishes a spatial and"
8930,_ITHAKEIAD._,"spiritual environment. The hut of the swineherd is but a phase, one"
8931,_ITHAKEIAD._,landing-place in the career of Ulysses. An idyllic spot and forever
8932,_ITHAKEIAD._,beautiful; who but Homer has ever gotten so much poetry out of a
8933,_ITHAKEIAD._,pig-sty? We witness the transfiguration of what is the very lowest of
8934,_ITHAKEIAD._,"human existence into what is the very highest, veritably the Godlike on"
8935,_ITHAKEIAD._,earth.
8936,_ITHAKEIAD._,
8937,_ITHAKEIAD._,"Ulysses, however, has to remain in disguise even to his most faithful"
8938,_ITHAKEIAD._,"servant; not out of distrust we must think, but out of prudence."
8939,_ITHAKEIAD._,"Knowing his master, the swineherd would be a different person in the"
8940,_ITHAKEIAD._,"presence of the Suitors; he has an open, sincere, transparent heart,"
8941,_ITHAKEIAD._,and he would probably let the secret be seen which lay therein. The
8942,_ITHAKEIAD._,"gift of disguise he possesses not, as Ulysses has clearly observed in"
8943,_ITHAKEIAD._,his conversation; in this respect he is the contrast to the Hero
8944,_ITHAKEIAD._,"himself. But Telemachus will get the secret, for he has craft, is the"
8945,_ITHAKEIAD._,true son of his father; has he not just shown the paternal trait in
8946,_ITHAKEIAD._,"cunningly thwarting the Suitors who are lying in wait for him, by the"
8947,_ITHAKEIAD._,"help of Pallas, of course?"
8948,_ITHAKEIAD._,
8949,_ITHAKEIAD._,"In these four Books, accordingly, we behold one stage of the great"
8950,_ITHAKEIAD._,preparation for the deed which is the culmination of the poem. Not now
8951,_ITHAKEIAD._,"the disciplinary, but the practical preparation it is, when one is"
8952,_ITHAKEIAD._,"ready and resolved internally, and is seeking the method and means."
8953,_ITHAKEIAD._,Both Ulysses and Telemachus have had their training; now it must pass
8954,_ITHAKEIAD._,into action.
8955,_ITHAKEIAD._,
8956,_ITHAKEIAD._,"We behold, first, Ulysses making the transition from Phæacia to Ithaca,"
8957,_ITHAKEIAD._,"and thence to the fortress of loyalty, from which the movement is to be"
8958,_ITHAKEIAD._,"made. Secondly we see all the instruments getting together, and being"
8959,_ITHAKEIAD._,"prepared for the work, particularly the three heroes of the attack."
8960,_ITHAKEIAD._,Finally we observe Ulysses inquiring and learning all about the
8961,_ITHAKEIAD._,situation in Ithaca; he obtains everything that information at second
8962,_ITHAKEIAD._,hand can give. But hearsay is not enough; he must see at first hand.
8963,_ITHAKEIAD._,"Thus we pass to the palace, and out of the first series of four Books,"
8964,_ITHAKEIAD._,which we are next to consider separately.
8965,_ITHAKEIAD._,
8966,_ITHAKEIAD._,
8967,_ITHAKEIAD._,
8968,_ITHAKEIAD._,
8969,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._
8970,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
8971,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
8972,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"In general, we have in this Book the grand transition from Phæacia to"
8973,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"Ithaca, in both of its phases, physical and spiritual. The sea is"
8974,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"crossed from land to land in a ship; the idyllic realm is left behind,"
8975,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,and the real world with its terrible problem is encountered. Phæacia
8976,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,was quite without conflict. Ithaca is just in the condition of conflict
8977,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"and discord. Phæacia, moreover, was a land of looking back at the past,"
8978,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,of reminiscence and retrospection; Ithaca is the land of looking
8979,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"directly into the face of the future, with the deed to follow at once;"
8980,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"it is the field for action and not contemplation. Not only spatially,"
8981,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,but also in thought we must regard this transition.
8982,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
8983,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,Ulysses has both these worlds in him; he is the man of thought and the
8984,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,man of action. Hitherto in his career the stress has been upon the
8985,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"former; henceforth it is to be upon the latter. In this Book, which is"
8986,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"the overture marking the change in the key-note of the poem, we have"
8987,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,three distinct facts brought out prominently and through them we can
8988,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"grasp the general structure. There is, first, the departure of Ulysses"
8989,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"from Phæacia and arrival at Ithaca; secondly, when this is finished,"
8990,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"there is the glance backward, on the part of the poet, to the"
8991,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"miraculous voyage and to Phæacia itself, in which glance Neptune plays"
8992,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"an important part; thirdly, there is the glance forward, which occupies"
8993,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"most of the Book, taking in Ithaca and the future, in which glance"
8994,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"Pallas, the Goddess of foresight, gives the chief direction, and"
8995,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"Ulysses is her mortal counterpart. This is, accordingly, to a large"
8996,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"extent a Book of divine suggestion; two deities appear, the Upper World"
8997,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"plays into the Lower World, yet in very different manners. The God of"
8998,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"the Sea seems to be an obstructionist, a reactionary, with look turned"
8999,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"behind, an old divinity of Nature; while Pallas always has her look"
9000,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"turned forward, and is furthering the great deed of purification, is"
9001,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,wholly a divinity of Spirit. These three phases of the Book we shall
9002,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,note more fully.
9003,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9004,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,I. We have a glimpse of the court at Phæacia; Ulysses has ended the
9005,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"long account of his experience, the time of action has arrived. The"
9006,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,formal yet hearty farewell is described; the gifts of the host are
9007,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"given, and the guest is sent on his way. Nor must we forget the bard"
9008,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"Demodocus, still singing at the banquet, but the theme of his song is"
9009,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"not now mentioned; evidently it was some tale of Troy, as before, and"
9010,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,this stage of song has been far transcended by Ulysses. Very eager the
9011,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"Hero was to start; ""often he turned his head toward the all-shining"
9012,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"Sun"" to see how far away the hour still remained. He wishes to listen"
9013,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"to no more lays of the Past, sweet though they be, nor does he desire"
9014,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,to tell any tales himself.
9015,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9016,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"Moreover we hear the great longing of his heart: ""May I, returning,"
9017,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"find at home my blameless wife!"" In like manner he wishes domestic joy"
9018,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"to the king, as this whole Phæacian world partakes more of the Family"
9019,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"than of the State. Of course, he cannot leave without going to the"
9020,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"heart and center of the Family, namely, Arete, wife, mother, and even"
9021,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,judge of the people. So we hear from the lips of Ulysses a final
9022,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"salutation to her in her threefold character, ""Within thy household"
9023,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"rejoice in thy children, thy people and thy husband the king."" She"
9024,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,looks to the domestic part on the ship for Ulysses; she sends servants
9025,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"bearing bread, wine and garments for the passage. Nausicaa we feel to"
9026,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"be present in the last interview, but not a word from her or from the"
9027,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"departing guest to her; self-suppression is indeed the law for both,"
9028,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,for is not Penelope the grand end of this voyage?
9029,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9030,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,The ship of the Phæacians in which the passage is made is a miraculous
9031,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"one, and yet prophetic; it is gifted with thought and flies more fleet"
9032,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"than a falcon, swiftest of birds. Again the mythical account prefigures"
9033,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"the reality, and this little marvelous story of the sea hints, yes,"
9034,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,calls for the speed of modern navigation. It is not a matter to be
9035,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"understood; Ulysses, the wise man, knows nothing about it, he is sunk"
9036,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,in sleep while making the passage. But the wise man is to come to
9037,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,knowledge hereafter.
9038,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9039,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"He has arrived in Ithaca, and entered a safe port; he, still deep in"
9040,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"slumber, is laid on the shore with all his goods and gifts, when the"
9041,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,mariners turn back. At this point we have an interesting description of
9042,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"the surroundings, wherein we may observe the poet's employment of"
9043,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,nature as a setting for the returned Ulysses. There is the secure haven
9044,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,shutting off the winds and waves of the sea; at the end of the haven
9045,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"stands the olive tree, product of culture, and hinting the civilized"
9046,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"world, which Ulysses now enters; it was a tree sacred to Pallas in"
9047,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"later Greek legend, and, doubtless, in Homer's time also. Next came the"
9048,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"cave of the Nymphs called Naiads, with its curious shapes of stone, the"
9049,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"work of the Nymphs to the old Greek eye, but named stalagmites and"
9050,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"stalactites in modern speech. Two are the entrances, one for Gods and"
9051,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"one for men; both human and divine visitors come thither, it is indeed"
9052,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"a point of meeting for the two influences, which is its essential"
9053,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"suggestion. Ulysses, lying with his goods beneath the olive tree and"
9054,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"near the cave, is under divine protection, which here Nature herself is"
9055,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"made to declare. This scenery is not introduced for its own sake, but"
9056,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"for the divinity in it, whereof another example is to follow in the"
9057,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,case of Neptune.
9058,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9059,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,There have been repeated attempts to identify the locality described by
9060,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,the poet with the present geography of Ithaca. Travelers have imagined
9061,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"that they have found the haven and cave, notably this was the case with"
9062,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,Sir William Gell; but the more common view now is that they were
9063,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"mistaken. Homer from his knowledge of Greece, which has everywhere"
9064,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"harbors, caves and olive-trees, constructed an ideal landscape for his"
9065,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"own purpose, quite as every poet does. He may or may not have seen"
9066,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"Ithaca; in either case, the poetic result is the same."
9067,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9068,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,II. The physical transition from Phæacia to Ithaca is accomplished;
9069,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"while Ulysses is asleep, the poet casts a glance backward at the"
9070,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,marvelous ship and at the marvelous land which has just been left
9071,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,behind. Both are henceforth to be forever closed to the real world and
9072,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"its intercourse; the realm of fable is shut off from Ithaca, and from"
9073,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,the rest of this poem.
9074,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9075,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,The matter is presented in the form of a conflict between the Phæacians
9076,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"and Neptune, between the sea-faring people and the sea; clearly it is"
9077,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,one of the many struggles between Man and Nature which the Greek Mythus
9078,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"is always portraying, because these struggles were the ever-present"
9079,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,fact in Greek life. The God has been circumvented by the speed of the
9080,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"navigators; Ulysses without suffering, without a storm, has reached"
9081,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"Ithaca. ""No more honor for me from mortals or Gods,"" cries Neptune, ""if"
9082,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"I can be thus defied?"" He makes his appeal to the Highest God, and we"
9083,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"hear the decision: ""Turn the ship to a stone and hide the city with a"
9084,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"mountain."" The first is accomplished in view of the Phæacians; the"
9085,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"second is possibly prevented by their speedy sacrifices to Neptune, and"
9086,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"the new decree of the ruler, which forbids their giving further escort"
9087,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,over the sea to strangers. At any rate Phæacia is shut off from the
9088,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"world, and has not been heard of since; there have been no more"
9089,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,transitions thence since that of Ulysses. The marvelous ship and the
9090,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"marvelous city vanish forever by a divine act, even by the will of"
9091,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"Zeus. Yet, on the other hand, they eternally remain, crystallized in"
9092,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"these verses of Homer, more lasting than the rock of Neptune."
9093,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9094,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,Why this interference from above? Wherein is the escort by the
9095,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,Phæacians a violation of the divine order as voiced by the Supreme God?
9096,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"Note that Ulysses has escaped, which is the will of Zeus; note, too,"
9097,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"that the Phæacians are punished for helping him escape, which is also"
9098,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,the will of Zeus. The sailors bring the wanderer to his home without
9099,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"trouble, but they are smitten by the God while returning."
9100,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9101,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"For the primal suggestion of the legend, may we not say that the sea,"
9102,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,that enormous force of Nature with many reserved energies in its vast
9103,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"bosom, though bestrid and subdued by a ship, at times breaks loose and"
9104,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"destroys, in spite of skillful navigation and perfect machinery? Still"
9105,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"to-day the sea has a residue of the uncontrollable, and probably will"
9106,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,have for some ages to come. Neptune has not ceased from his wrath
9107,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"against the man of thought, who tries to straddle and ride him, and"
9108,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"Zeus still supports at times the Sea-god's appeal for honor, when his"
9109,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"prerogative is violated. Yet not always by any means, for Zeus belongs"
9110,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"to the true Olympians, deities of intelligence, who once put down the"
9111,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,old Gods of Nature.
9112,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9113,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"Still Nature has its right, nay, its law with the penalty. The poet"
9114,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,looks upon the sea as a great deity demanding sacrifice and honor.
9115,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"Furthermore, for every conquest made over it, there is the"
9116,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"counterstroke, the resistance, which is the vengeance of the God. Thus"
9117,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"says Zeus: ""If any man, trusting in his own strength, refuses to give"
9118,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"unto thee honor, always vengeance is thine afterwards."""
9119,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9120,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,We have already noticed the creed of the poet to be that every action
9121,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"has its penalty; the deed, even the good deed, is the fruit of a"
9122,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"conflict and puts down something which has its might, aye its right,"
9123,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,which is soon to make itself felt in counteraction. _Es rächt sich
9124,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"alles auf Erden_, sings our last world-poet in full harmony with his"
9125,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,eldest brother.
9126,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9127,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"It is not surprising that Alcinous at this point remembers an ""ancient"
9128,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"God-spoken oracle,"" which had uttered in advance the wrath of Neptune"
9129,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"and the present penalty. In like manner, Polyphemus, in his crisis,"
9130,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,remembered a similar oracle. It is indeed the deep suggestion of Nature
9131,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,which the sages have heard in all times. The poet takes his thought and
9132,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"works it into a mythical shape, in which, however, we are to see not"
9133,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,merely the story but the insight into the world order.
9134,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9135,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"Ulysses now leaves the sea, after having been chiefly in a struggle"
9136,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"with it for years, ever since he sailed from Troy. It was the element"
9137,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"in his way, the environment always hostile to him; Neptune was the"
9138,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,deity who was angry and made him suffer. Still the God of the sea could
9139,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"not prevent his Return, such was the will of Zeus. Thus we cast a"
9140,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"glance back at the Phæacians who vanish, and at Neptune who also"
9141,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,vanishes.
9142,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9143,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"The poem henceforth quits the sea, after marking the fate of the"
9144,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"sea-faring people of Phæacia. That great mysterious body of water, with"
9145,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"its uncertainties of wind and wave, with its hidden rocks and magic"
9146,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"islands, is now to drop out of the horizen of the Odyssey. It is the"
9147,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"great sea-poem of the Greeks, yes of the world; the sea is the setting"
9148,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"of its adventurous, marvelous, illimitable portion. It comes out the"
9149,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"sea, with its realm of wonders; henceforth it is a land poem in the"
9150,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,clear finite world. Ulysses the Hero must turn his face away from the
9151,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,briny element; not without significance is that command given him that
9152,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,he must go till he find a people who take an oar for a winnowing-fan
9153,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"ere he can reach peace. So the fairy-ship ceased to run, but the"
9154,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,steam-ship has taken its place in these Ithacan waters. Still the
9155,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"poetic atmosphere of the Odyssey, in spite of steam, hovers over the"
9156,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"islands of western Greece to-day; the traveler in the harbor of Corfu,"
9157,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,will look up at the city from the deck of his vessel and call back the
9158,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"image of Phæacia, and if he listens to the speech of the Greek sailors,"
9159,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"he will find words still in use which were employed by old Homer,"
9160,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,possibly were heard by the poet in this very harbor.
9161,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9162,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"III. Next comes the most important and longest portion of the Book,"
9163,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"turning the glance forward to Ithaca and the future, also to the great"
9164,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"deed of the poem. A new deity appears when Neptune vanishes, not a"
9165,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,hostile power of Nature but a helpful spirit of Intelligence--it is the
9166,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"Goddess of Wisdom, Pallas. This divine transition from the one God to"
9167,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"the other is the real inner fact, while the physical transition is but"
9168,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,the outer setting and suggestion.
9169,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9170,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"Accordingly, the theme now is the man and the deity, Ulysses and Pallas"
9171,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,in their interrelation. We are to have a complete account of the human
9172,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,unfolding into a vision of the divine. The movement is from a complete
9173,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"separation of the twain, to mutual recognition, and then to"
9174,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,co-operation. Pallas has had little to do with Ulysses during his great
9175,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"sea-journey, and since he left Troy. That long wandering on the water"
9176,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"was without her, lay not at all in her domain, which is that of clear"
9177,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,self-conscious Intelligence. That misty Fableland is the realm of other
9178,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"divinities, though she appeared in Phæacia."
9179,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9180,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"The question, therefore, is at present: How shall this man come into"
9181,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,the knowledge of the Goddess? How shall he know the truth of the
9182,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"reality about him in his new situation, how understand this world of"
9183,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"wisdom? The sides are two: the man and the deity, and they must become"
9184,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"one in spirit. The supreme thing, therefore, is that Ulysses hear the"
9185,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"voice of Pallas, and develop into unity with her; indeed that may be"
9186,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,held to be the supreme thing in Religion and Philosophy: to hear the
9187,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,voice of God. Even in the business of daily life the first object is to
9188,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,find out the word of Pallas.
9189,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9190,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"Such is the dualism in the world, which must be harmonized; but in the"
9191,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,individual also there is another dualism which has to be harmonized.
9192,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"Ulysses is mortal, finite, given over to doubt, passion, caprice, is"
9193,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"the unwise man, subjective; but he is also the wise man, has an"
9194,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,infinite nature which is just the mastery of all his weakness; he has
9195,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"always the possibility of wisdom, and will come to it by a little"
9196,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,discipline. He will rise out of his subjective self into the objective
9197,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,God. This is just the process which the poet is now going to portray;
9198,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"the Hero overwhelmed in his new situation and with his new problem, is"
9199,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"to ascend into communion with Pallas, is to behold wisdom in person and"
9200,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"hear her voice, and then is to advance to the deed. This process we may"
9201,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"look at in four different stages, as they unfold on the lines laid down"
9202,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,by the poet.
9203,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9204,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,1. First we have quite a full picture of Ulysses before he reaches the
9205,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"recognition of the Divine, and of his gradual climbing-up to that"
9206,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"point. At the start he is asleep, is not even conscious of the external"
9207,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"world about him, he has indeed entered a new realm, yet old. As long as"
9208,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"the Phæacian spell is upon him, he can do nought but slumber. Then he"
9209,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"wakes, he sees but does not recognize his own country. He doubts, he"
9210,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"blames the Phæacians wrongfully, in his distrust of them he counts over"
9211,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"his treasures. He is now the unwise, capricious man; he has no"
9212,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"perception of Pallas; not only the land is in disguise to him, he is in"
9213,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"disguise to himself, to his better self."
9214,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9215,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,Yet the poet is careful to mark the providential purpose just in this
9216,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"disguise. The Goddess threw a mist over things, that he might not know"
9217,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"them, or make himself known till all was in readiness for the"
9218,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"destruction of the Suitors, till she had told him what he had to do."
9219,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,Still it is his own act or state that he cannot at first hear the voice
9220,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,of the Goddess.
9221,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9222,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"The next step is that he recognizes the country, it is described to him"
9223,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"and named by Pallas. But she is in disguise now; she has appeared, but"
9224,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"not in her true form; she is not yet wisdom, but simply identifies the"
9225,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"land, telling him: ""This is Ithaca."" Thus he recognizes the external"
9226,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"landscape, but not the Goddess, who is as yet but a simple shepherd"
9227,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,describing things.
9228,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9229,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"Now what will he do? He also will disguise himself to the shepherd,"
9230,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,because he does not recognize who it is. He makes up a fable to account
9231,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"for his presence and for his goods. Both are now in disguise, the man"
9232,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"and deity, to each other. They are doing the same thing, they are one,"
9233,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,with that thin veil of concealment between them.
9234,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9235,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"Then comes the mutual recognition. She tears away the veil, laughs at"
9236,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"his artifice, and calls out her own designation: Pallas Athena. She had"
9237,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"previously named Ithaca, which brings the recognition of the outer"
9238,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"world; now she names herself, which brings the recognition of the"
9239,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,divine world. Thus Ulysses has rapidly passed from sleep through a
9240,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"series of non-cognizant states, till he beholds the Goddess."
9241,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9242,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,2. Both the deity and mortal have now reached the stage of mutual
9243,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"recognition, and thrown off their mutual disguise, which was a false"
9244,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"relation, though it often exists. Does not the man at times conceal"
9245,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"himself to the God, by self-deception, self-excuse, by lying to his"
9246,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"higher nature? In such case is not the God also hidden, in fact"
9247,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,compelled to assume a mask? Thus the poet brings before us the
9248,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"wonderful interplay between the human and divine, till they fully"
9249,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,recognize each other.
9250,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9251,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"At once Pallas changes, she assumes a new form, the outward plastic"
9252,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"shape corresponding to her Godhood in the Greek conception, that of ""a"
9253,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"woman beautiful and stately."" Nor must we forget that Ulysses has also"
9254,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"changed, the two transformations run parallel, in the spirit of the man"
9255,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,and in the form of the Goddess. This unity of character also is stated
9256,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"by Pallas; ""both of us are skilled in wiles; thou art the best of"
9257,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,mortals in counsel and in words; I am famed among the Gods for wisdom
9258,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"and cunning."" Hence her argument runs, let us throw off disguise to"
9259,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"each other, for we have a great work before us."
9260,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9261,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"It is also to be noted by the reader that each, the man and the"
9262,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"Goddess, ascribes to the other the credit of skill and forethought,"
9263,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,specially the credit of coming to Ithaca in disguise to discover the
9264,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"true situation. Says Pallas: ""Another man would have rushed to see wife"
9265,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"and children in his house, but thou wilt first test thy wife."" Here the"
9266,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"Goddess gives the thought to the man. Says Ulysses: ""Surely I would"
9267,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"have perished in my own palace, like Agamemnon, if thou, O Goddess,"
9268,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"hadst not told me everything aright."" Here the man gives the thought to"
9269,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"the Goddess. This is not a contradiction, both are correct, and the"
9270,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"insight is to see that both are one, and saying the same thing at"
9271,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"bottom. The deity must be in the man, as well as in the world; and the"
9272,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,man must hear the deity speaking the truth of the world ere he attain
9273,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,unto wisdom.
9274,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9275,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"Even the mist which hung over the landscape at first, has now"
9276,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,completely vanished; Ulysses recognizes all the local details--the
9277,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"haven, the olive-tree, the grot of the Nymphs, and the mountain; all"
9278,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,the Ithacan objects of Nature come back fully. But chiefly he
9279,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"recognizes the Goddess, whereupon both can pass to the great matter in"
9280,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,hand--the deed.
9281,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9282,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,3. This deed has been often mentioned before--the purification of
9283,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"Ithaca, chiefly by the slaughter of the Suitors, ""the shameless set,"
9284,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"who usurp thy house and woo thy wife."" Sitting on the roots of the"
9285,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"sacred olive, the two, the man and the deity, plan destruction to the"
9286,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"guilty. Verily those double elements, the human and the divine, must"
9287,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,co-operate if the great action be performed. The eternal principle of
9288,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"right, the moral order of the world, must unite with the free agency of"
9289,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,the individual in bringing about the regeneration of the land. Thus
9290,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"after their complete recognition and harmony, which takes place out of"
9291,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"separation, Ulysses and Pallas look forward to the impending deed,"
9292,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,which is their unity realized and standing forth as a fact in the
9293,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,world.
9294,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9295,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"4. Finally we have the manner of doing the deed, the plan is laid"
9296,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"before us. Pallas tells Ulysses that he must again assume his disguise,"
9297,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,both in the hut of the swineherd and in the palace at Ithaca. She does
9298,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,not propose to do his work for him; on the contrary it must be his own
9299,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"spontaneous energy. In fact, Pallas is in him making this suggestion,"
9300,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"yet outside of him, too, speaking the voice of the situation."
9301,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9302,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"The scheme shows the structure of these four Books (XIII-XVI),"
9303,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,organized of course by Pallas. Ulysses is to go to the swineherd who is
9304,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"loyal, and will give shelter. Telemachus is to be brought to the same"
9305,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"place by Pallas, not externally, as we shall see, but through the free"
9306,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,act of Telemachus himself. Thus the three chosen men are gathered
9307,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,together in their unsuspected fortress. Two things we must note in
9308,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,regard to these movements: they are wholly voluntary on part of the
9309,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"persons making them, yet they belong in the Divine Order, and thus are"
9310,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,the work of the deity. Free-Will and Providence do not trammel each
9311,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"other, but harmoniously co-operate to the same end. So carefully and"
9312,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,completely is this thought elaborated that we may consider it
9313,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,fundamental in the creed of the poet.
9314,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9315,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"In such manner the weak, finite Ulysses is brought into communion with"
9316,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"the immortal Goddess. Yet he, the poor frail mortal, drops for a moment"
9317,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"even here. When Pallas speaks of Telemachus having gone to Sparta, to"
9318,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"learn about his father, Ulysses petulantly asks: ""Why did not you, who"
9319,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"know all things, tell that to him"" without the peril of such a journey?"
9320,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,The answer of Pallas is clear; I sent him in order that he might be a
9321,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"man among men, and have the good fame of his action. Telemachus, too,"
9322,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,must be a free man; that is the education of Pallas. The Goddess will
9323,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,help him only when he helps himself. Divinity is not to sap human
9324,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"volition, but to enforce it; she would unmake Telemachus, if she"
9325,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"allowed him to stay at home and do nothing, tied to his mother's apron"
9326,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,strings.
9327,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9328,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,And here we cannot help noting an observation on Homer's poetry. It
9329,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,must be in the reader ere he can see it in the book. Unless he be ready
9330,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"for its spirit, it will not appear, certainly it will not speak. There"
9331,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,must be a rise into the vision of Homeric poetry on the part of the
9332,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"reader, as there is a rise into the vision of the Goddess on the part"
9333,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"of Ulysses. The two sides, the human and the divine, or the Terrestrial"
9334,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"and the Olympian, must meet and commune; thus the reader, too, in"
9335,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,"perusing Homer, must become heroic and behold the Gods."
9336,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9337,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9338,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9339,_BOOK THIRTEENTH._,
9340,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._
9341,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9342,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9343,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,The Book begins with another transition in place; Ulysses passes from
9344,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"the sea-shore, with its haven, grot, and olive-tree up into the"
9345,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"mountain, to the hut of Eumæus. We have quite a full description of the"
9346,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,latter's abode; there is a lodge surrounded by a court and a wall;
9347,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"within this inclosure are the sties, and the droves of swine over which"
9348,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"he is the keeper, with four assistants. Nor must we omit the fierce"
9349,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"dogs, savage as wild beasts. Such is the new environment which Ulysses"
9350,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"enters, and which has at its center a human being who gives character"
9351,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,to this little world. Again we catch a clear quick glimpse of the Greek
9352,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,landscape in one of its phases.
9353,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9354,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"The spiritual transition is, however, the main thing. Ulysses passes"
9355,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"from Pallas, the deity of pure wisdom, to Eumæus, the humblest of"
9356,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"mortals in his vocation. Yet this poor man too has the divine in him,"
9357,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"and manifests it in a supreme degree, not, however, in the form of"
9358,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"reflective wisdom, but in the form of piety, of an immediate faith in"
9359,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,the Gods. Still this faith has its sore trial. Such is the contrast
9360,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,between the two men. Ulysses has brought with him the Goddess of
9361,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Wisdom, whose words he has heard, and with whom he has held communion."
9362,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Hardly does Eumæus know Pallas, he has not the internal gift of seeing"
9363,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"her in her own shape. Thus both these men share in the divine, but in"
9364,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,very different ways.
9365,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9366,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,From this difference in the two men spring both the character and the
9367,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"matter of the Book. It is a play, a disguise; a play between Wisdom and"
9368,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Faith, in which the former must be in disguise to the latter, yet both"
9369,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,have the same substance at bottom. For Faith is Faith because it cannot
9370,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"take the form of Intelligence, yet may have in its simple immediate"
9371,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,form all the content of Intelligence.
9372,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9373,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Eumæus has an open single-hearted piety; he cannot play a disguise, he"
9374,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,hates it for he has been deceived by it when assumed by lying fablers.
9375,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,For this reason he is not intrusted with the secret of his master's
9376,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"return till the last moment, he would have to dissemble, to violate his"
9377,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"own nature, and then perhaps he would not have succeeded in his"
9378,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,attempt. So Ulysses with a true regard for his man withholds the great
9379,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"secret, and has to play under cover in order to get the needful"
9380,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,information.
9381,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9382,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Accordingly the present Book has a decided tinge of comedy. There is,"
9383,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"on the one hand, the disguise, external and internal--in garments and"
9384,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"in identity; on the other hand, there is the error which takes one"
9385,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"person for another, and produces the comic situation. Thus the Book is"
9386,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"prophetic of a great branch of Literature, and may be considered as a"
9387,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"starting-point of Greek Comedy, yes, as one of the origins of"
9388,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Shakespeare. To be sure, it is not mere fun or amusement; it is the"
9389,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Comedy of Providence, who often is in disguise bringing his blessing."
9390,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,Eumæus in his piety has just that which he thinks he has not; his
9391,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,loyalty has brought to him just that which he most desired; his mistake
9392,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"is in reality no mistake, but a mere appearance which will vanish in"
9393,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,the end.
9394,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9395,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,It is true that this sport of comic disguise began in the previous Book
9396,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"with Pallas. But can the mortal hide himself from the deity, specially"
9397,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,from the deity of wisdom? Hence the Goddess tears away the mask with a
9398,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"smile, and there follows the recognition. But at present it is the"
9399,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"mortal who is the victim of disguise, by virtue of his limitations."
9400,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Still the mortal, when he cannot see, can believe, and so transcend"
9401,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"these same limitations. Thus it is with Eumæus, his mistake is a comic"
9402,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,nullity.
9403,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9404,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"In the hut of the swineherd, there is no domestic life, the woman is"
9405,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,absent. This condition is specially ascribed to the present state of
9406,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"things in Ithaca. Eumæus, though he be a slave, could have a household,"
9407,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"""a dwelling and ground and wife,"" if his old master were at home. Even"
9408,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"now he has his own servant, bought with his own wealth. Slavery was not"
9409,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,a hard condition in the house of Ulysses; it was domestic in the best
9410,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,sense probably. Indeed the slaves were often of as high birth as their
9411,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"masters, who in turn might be slaves in the next fluctuation of war."
9412,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Eumæus himself was of kingly blood, and he retains his regal character"
9413,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,in his servitude.
9414,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9415,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,Ulysses has now reached the fortress which is to be the rallying-point
9416,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"of his army of three heroes, and from which he is to issue to the work"
9417,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"of the time. But that is hereafter. In the present Book, we have his"
9418,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"play with Eumæus, his disguise, which assumes three main attitudes."
9419,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"First, he is passive, chiefly asking and listening; thus he gets out of"
9420,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,Eumæus what information he wishes; then he plays an active part in his
9421,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"disguise, telling his own history under the mask of fiction; finally he"
9422,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"assumes an open disguise, that is, he tells of one of his artifices at"
9423,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Troy, and then states his present object in telling it. The simple"
9424,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Eumæus, however, does not suspect him in all these transformations."
9425,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,Still we may notice in the swineherd a strong feeling of oneness with
9426,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"the stranger, an unconscious presentiment of who he is."
9427,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9428,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,I. The approach of Ulysses to the lodge of Eumæus is an experience
9429,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,which one may have in the mountains of Greece to-day. We can find the
9430,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"same general outline of a hut with its surrounding fence and court, in"
9431,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"which domestic animals are penned, particularly during the night. Then"
9432,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"there is that same welcome from the dogs, which issue forth in a pack"
9433,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"with an unearthly howling, growling and barking at the approaching"
9434,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"stranger, till somebody appear and pelt them with stones. Often must"
9435,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"the wandering Homer have had such a greeting! The hospitable swineherd,"
9436,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Eumæus, the poet must have met with in his travels; the whole scene and"
9437,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,character are drawn directly from real life. A similar reception we
9438,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"have had in a remote pastoral lodge, dogs included. But the modern"
9439,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"pedestrian will hardly employ the ruse of Ulysses, that of sitting down"
9440,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,on the ground and letting his staff drop out of his hand. He will use
9441,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"his weapon and grasp for a stone everywhere present on the Greek soil,"
9442,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,though the fight be unequal. Still the sentence of Pliny (_Nat. Hist._
9443,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,VIII. 61) deserves always to be cited in this connection: _impetus
9444,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,eorum (canum) et soevitia mitigatur ab homine considente humi_; as if
9445,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,dogs in the height of their rage might be touched with the plea of
9446,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,piety.
9447,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9448,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,The character of the swineherd straightway shows itself by his conduct
9449,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"toward this poor hungry stranger, a vagabond in appearance. To be sure,"
9450,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,hospitality was and is a common virtue in Greece; but Eumæus saw at
9451,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"once in the wretched looking man his master ""wandering among people of"
9452,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"a strange tongue, needing food."" Therefore come, old man, and satisfy"
9453,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,yourself with bread and wine. Such is the strong fellow-feeling warming
9454,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,the hearth of that humble lodge. Misfortune has not soured the
9455,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"swineherd, but he has extracted from it his greatest blessing--an"
9456,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"universal charity. This is not a momentary emotion, but has risen to a"
9457,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"religious principle: ""All strangers and the poor are of Zeus;"" such is"
9458,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,the vital word of his creed. He is a slave and has not much to share;
9459,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"""our giving is small but dear to us;"" very dear indeed, a mite only,"
9460,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"but it is as good as a world. Well may we call him, with the poet, in"
9461,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"the best sense of the title: ""the divine swineherd."" We should note too"
9462,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"that the poet addresses Eumæus in the second person singular, with a"
9463,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,tone of loving familiarity very seldom employed elsewhere in his two
9464,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,poems. Was there some intimate personal relation figured in this
9465,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,character which we still seem to feel afar off there in antiquity?
9466,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9467,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,At any rate the picture of the swineherd has the most modern touch to
9468,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,be found in Homer. It shows the feeling of humanity developed quite to
9469,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"its supreme fullness; it has modern sentiment, nay, it borders at times"
9470,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"upon modern sentimentality. It recalls the recent novel, which takes"
9471,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,its hero from the lowest class and garnishes him with regal virtues.
9472,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Strange old Homer, prophetic again! He seems to have anticipated the"
9473,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"art-forms of all the ages, and to have laid down the lines on which the"
9474,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"literary spirit must move forever. Otherwise, indeed, it could not be;"
9475,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,he has in him the germs of future development; the last novel is
9476,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"contained in the first, which is the tale of Eumæus."
9477,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9478,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"In the character of the swineherd, the central point is his loyalty,"
9479,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,adamantine as the rock of his humble home. It is loyalty in a double
9480,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"sense: to his divine and to his human master, to God and to man, Zeus"
9481,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"and Ulysses. The same trait it is, in a terrestrial and a celestial"
9482,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,manifestation. Both sides of this loyalty are just now under the sorest
9483,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,trial; there is every temptation to fall away from God and man and
9484,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,become wholly disloyal. Many have yielded but he will not; in his
9485,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,solitary abode he keeps piety and patriotism aflame with the breath of
9486,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,his spirit. Hence he furnishes the rock on which the new order can be
9487,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"built; without this loyalty in the humble class, no restoration would"
9488,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"be possible, even with the presence of Ulysses."
9489,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9490,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,First we may notice that he is loyal to his human master though he
9491,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,believes that the latter is dead and cannot return. Still he does not
9492,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"pass over to the side of the Suitors, who are doing that master and his"
9493,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"house the great wrong. Secondly, the swineherd is loyal to Zeus and the"
9494,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Divine Order of the World. Hear him: ""The Gods love not deeds of"
9495,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"violence; they honor justice and the rightful works of men."" Such is"
9496,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,his faith; still this faith is passing through the ordeal of fire: why
9497,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"should the Gods, being good, keep the good Ulysses away from his"
9498,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Return? The simple swineherd cannot fathom the ways of Providence,"
9499,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,still he believes in that Providence; he is divinely loyal. His
9500,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"allegiance does not depend upon prosperity, not even upon insight. Zeus"
9501,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"may rule the world as he pleases, I shall still have faith: ""Though he"
9502,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"slay me, I shall believe in him."""
9503,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9504,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,Now we may turn for a moment to Ulysses. He is a passive learner from
9505,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"the swineherd, calling forth information by subtle inquiry; much,"
9506,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"indeed, has he learned from the humble, pious man. First, he has seen a"
9507,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"shadow of his own doubt, and how it may be dispelled. Then he has"
9508,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"discovered loyalty in this representative of the people, who must still"
9509,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"possess it in their hearts, though suppressed in the present, untoward"
9510,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"time. Also he hears again of the Suitors and their guilty deeds, viewed"
9511,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,with a loyal eye. Finally he plays the prophet to Eumæus and foretells
9512,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"the return of Ulysses. This is the height of his disguise, wherein he"
9513,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"rises to the humor of Providence, who has brought to the swineherd the"
9514,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,realization of his strongest wish without his knowing it. His prayers
9515,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"have come to pass, could he but see. Herein Ulysses suggests the part"
9516,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"of Providence in disguise, bringing the fulfillment of his own"
9517,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,prophecy.
9518,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9519,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,II. It is now the turn of Ulysses to give some account of himself in
9520,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"answer to the swineherd's pressing questions. He tells a famous story,"
9521,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"a fiction of his own life, yet it has in its disguise the truth of his"
9522,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"career. The outer setting is changed, but the main facts are the same."
9523,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,Still there is enough difference to prevent it from being a repetition.
9524,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"It is the Odyssey told over again with new incidents, and variations"
9525,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"upon an old theme. We behold here the conscious storyteller, clothing"
9526,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,the events of life in the garb of a marvelous adventure. Ulysses had in
9527,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"mind his own experience in this account, and he adapts it to the time"
9528,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,and place.
9529,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9530,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"The main points of its contact with himself we may note. First, there"
9531,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"is the pre-Trojan period, a time of roving and marauding, which is true"
9532,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"of that age in general, and may have some touch of Ulysses in"
9533,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"particular. Second is the Trojan war, the epoch of heroic conflict to"
9534,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"which all had to go, so strong was the public sentiment. Third comes"
9535,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"the post-Trojan epoch, with the wanton attack on the Ægyptians, very"
9536,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,much like the attack upon the Ciconians in the Ninth Book. From these
9537,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"attacks in both cases the grand calamity results, which causes the long"
9538,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"wandering. The Phoenician episode, however, has no counterpart in the"
9539,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"career of Ulysses. Fourth is the storm at sea, with the clinging to the"
9540,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"mast, and the landing upon the coast of the Thesprotians, all of which"
9541,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,is a transcript of the experience of Ulysses in getting to Phæacia from
9542,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Calypso's isle. Fifth is the arrival at Ithaca, which shows the actual"
9543,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"fact, with changed circumstances. Thus we may say that the true Ulysses"
9544,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,in disguise tells the true story of his life in disguise. This gift is
9545,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,what makes him the poet.
9546,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9547,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,Indeed we are compelled to think that Homer here suggests his own
9548,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"poetic procedure. What he narrates is his own experience, in the form"
9549,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"of art. His poetry is and must be his own life, though in disguise."
9550,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,Goethe has said something similar: All that I have written is what I
9551,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"have experienced, but not quite as I experienced it. In this story we"
9552,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,may hear in an undertone the old Greek poet telling one of his secrets
9553,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,of composition.
9554,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9555,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Moreover, it is a tale of providential escapes; thrice has the"
9556,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"so-called Cretan been saved specially, in Ægypt, from the"
9557,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Phoenicians, from the Thesprotians. Thus the story aims to encourage"
9558,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Eumæus, and to answer his doubt; it affirms the return of Ulysses, and"
9559,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,tells even the manner thereof; it is a story of Providence appealing to
9560,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"the swineherd's faith. On this line, too, it touches the ethical"
9561,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"content of the Odyssey, as the latter was sung to the whole Greek"
9562,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,world.
9563,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9564,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,Looking at the external circumstances of the story we note that it
9565,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,takes them from the social life of the time. There is universal
9566,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"slavery, with its accompaniment, man-stealing; the pirate and the"
9567,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"free-booter are still on the seas and furnish incidents of adventure,"
9568,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,yet commerce has also begun; the perils of navigation turn the voyage
9569,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,into a series of miraculous escapes. It is a time of dawn in which many
9570,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"distinctions, now clear, have not yet been made."
9571,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9572,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"We may also see the lines, though they be faint, of the movement of the"
9573,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"world's culture in this story. Crete, on the borderland between East"
9574,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"and West, is the home of the daring Greek adventurer who attacks Troy"
9575,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,on the one hand and Ægypt on the other. From Crete we pass backwards to
9576,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Phoenicia, as well as to the land of the Nile, and we catch a glimpse"
9577,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,of the current of Oriental influence flowing upon Greece. Already we
9578,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,have seen the spiritual gift of Egypt to the Greek mind shadowed forth
9579,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,in the story of Menelaus in the Fourth Book. In these latter Books of
9580,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,the Odyssey the Phoenician intercourse with Hellas is more strongly
9581,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"emphasized, with glances into their art, their trade, their navigation."
9582,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,All this Phoenician development the Greek looks at in a wondering way
9583,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,as if miraculous; he is reaching out for it also. To be sure the
9584,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Phoenician has a bad name, as a shrewd, even dishonest trader. Still"
9585,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"he is the middleman between nations, and a necessity."
9586,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9587,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Thus it appears that the Greeks have lost their Aryan connection, and"
9588,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,have become the heirs of a Semitic civilization. Homer does not seem to
9589,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"know his Indo-European kinship, but he does connect Hellas with"
9590,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Phoenicia and Egypt in many a spiritual tie. These ties take, for the"
9591,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"most part, a mythical form, still they must have been a great fact,"
9592,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,else they could not have influenced the mythology of the Greek race. So
9593,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"the present tale through the fiction of the myth-maker, hints the chief"
9594,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,social fact of the time.
9595,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9596,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"The fiction in the previous Book, which Ulysses began to tell to"
9597,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Pallas, also started in Crete, looked back at the Trojan war, and"
9598,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"connected with Idomeneus, the great hero of Cretan legend in the affair"
9599,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,of Troy. The Phoenican trader in his ship comes in there too. But
9600,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"that tale is cut short by the Goddess, who knows the disguise. In the"
9601,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"present case, however, the swineherd makes no such discovery. The next"
9602,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,Book will also have its corresponding tale.
9603,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9604,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Ulysses has thus told all about himself to the swineherd, has even"
9605,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,hinted in one place his disguise. He speaks of Ulysses having gone to
9606,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Dodona to consult the sacred oracle ""whether he should return to Ithaca"
9607,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"openly or secretly, after so long an absence."" He runs along the very"
9608,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"edge of discovering himself. But the swineherd will not believe; ""the"
9609,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Gods all hate my master"" is still his view. Already a lying Ætolian had"
9610,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"deceived him with a similar tale, which also introduced Idomeneus and"
9611,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"the Cretans. Ulysses has before himself a new picture of doubt, and its"
9612,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,blindness; quite a lesson it must have been to the skeptical man.
9613,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9614,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"The story, in its deepest suggestion, hints the manner of providential"
9615,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"working, as seen by the old bard. Eumæus has already had his prayers"
9616,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"for the return of his master fulfilled, though he does not know it, and"
9617,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,believes that they never will be fulfilled. Still he never gives up his
9618,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,divine loyalty and turns atheist. By his charity and piety he has
9619,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"helped, indeed has brought about the return of Ulysses unwittingly. The"
9620,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"man, if he follow the law, is always helping, though he may not see"
9621,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"that he is, may even think that he is not. This ethical order of the"
9622,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"world underlies the tale, and is what the ancient listener must have"
9623,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,felt so that Homer's poems became a bible to him. Providence in
9624,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"disguise is its title, here represented by the Hero in disguise."
9625,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9626,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,III. The supper and its preparation are quite fully described; it is
9627,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"the second meal of pork in this Book. This we may pass over, to note"
9628,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,the stratagem of Ulysses to obtain a cloak from the swineherd. The
9629,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,stranger tells his stratagem once upon a time at Troy for the same
9630,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"purpose; whereat the swineherd takes the hint and says: ""Thou shalt not"
9631,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"lack for a garment or anything else which is befitting a suppliant."""
9632,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"Thus Ulysses obtained his cloak, and slept warm by the hearth."
9633,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9634,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"But the other hint the swineherd did not take, the hint of the"
9635,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"disguise. He sees the artifice of his guest to obtain the cloak, but"
9636,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"never thinks in his own mind: This is Ulyssess himself, the man of"
9637,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,wiles trying to get the cloak again tonight. Yet Ulysses has gone far
9638,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"toward telling him just that. The swineherd cannot suspect, it is"
9639,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,foreign to his nature; this is just his beauty of character and its
9640,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,limitation.
9641,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9642,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,But Ulysses has to disguise in order to do his work. He is in his own
9643,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"land, on his own territory, yet he dares not appear as he is. This is"
9644,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,not his fault. His whole object is to get rid of this necessity of
9645,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"disguise, so that he may be himself. The time will not permit candor,"
9646,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,"hence his call is to correct the time. Violence is met by disguise, as"
9647,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,it always is; fraud destroys itself; the negation negates itself. Such
9648,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,is the process which we are now beholding.
9649,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9650,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9651,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9652,_BOOK FOURTEENTH._,
9653,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._
9654,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,
9655,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,
9656,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"In contrast with the previous Book, the present Book has not so much"
9657,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"disguise; Ulysses falls somewhat into the background, and several"
9658,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"undisguised characters came forward. Still there are points in common,"
9659,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"the most striking of which is the tale of Eumæus, the correspondence of"
9660,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,which with the tale of Ulysses in the Fourteenth Book impresses itself
9661,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,upon every careful reader.
9662,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,
9663,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,But the main fact of the present Book is the bringing together of the
9664,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"various threads for the grand final enterprise, which is the punishment"
9665,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,of the guilty Suitors. Ulysses and Eumæus are already on hand; to them
9666,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"now Telemachus is to be added, who comes from Sparta, whither he had"
9667,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,gone for the completion of his education. Thus the present Book goes
9668,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,back and connects with the Fourth Book in which we left Telemachus.
9669,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"Still further, the Ithakeiad is linked into and continues the"
9670,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"Telemachiad (the first four Books), inasmuch as we now see the purpose"
9671,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,of that famous journey of the son to the courts of Nestor and Menelaus.
9672,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"It was the training for a deed, a great deed which required knowledge,"
9673,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"skill, and resolution, and which was to show the youth to be the son of"
9674,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,his father.
9675,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,
9676,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,Such is another organic link which binds the whole Odyssey together.
9677,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"The two threads, separately developed hitherto, are now united and"
9678,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"interwoven with a third, that of Eumæus. Telemachus has seen two Trojan"
9679,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"heroes and heard their varied history, he has learned about his father"
9680,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,whom he is prepared in spirit to support. So the son has his Return
9681,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"also, a small one, yet important, be returns to Ithaca after the"
9682,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,experience at Pylos and Sparta and is joined to the great Return of his
9683,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,father.
9684,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,
9685,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"But just here with these evident marks of unity in the poem, occurs a"
9686,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,slip in chronology which has given the most solid comfort to those who
9687,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,wish to break up the Odyssey and assign its parts to different authors.
9688,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,In the Fourth Book (l. 594) Telemachus proposes to set out at once for
9689,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"home, he will not be detained even by the charm of Menelaus and Helen."
9690,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"That was the 6th day of the poem, whereas we find him here leaving"
9691,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"Sparta on 36th day of the poem, according to the usual reckoning. Two"
9692,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"inferences have been drawn from this discrepancy, if it be a"
9693,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,discrepancy. The Wolfian School cries out in chorus: two different
9694,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,poets for the two different passages; it would have been impossible for
9695,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"old Homer singing without any written copy thus to forget himself,"
9696,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,whatever a modern author might do with the manuscript or printed page
9697,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,before him. The other set of opinions will run just in the opposite
9698,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,direction: the connection between the Fourth and the Fifteenth Books is
9699,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"perfect, as far as thought, narrative, and incident are concerned; the"
9700,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,ancient listener and even the modern reader could pay no attention to
9701,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"the intricate points of chronology in the poem, especially when these"
9702,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"points lay more than ten Books or 5,000 lines apart from each other."
9703,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"There is no real sign of discrepant authorship, therefore, but rather a"
9704,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,new indication of unity.
9705,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,
9706,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"The general theme of the Book is, accordingly, the Return of"
9707,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"Telemachus, and his uniting with his father and the swineherd, who are"
9708,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,still further characterized in their relation. The structure of the
9709,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,Book falls easily into three portions: first is the separation of
9710,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,Telemachus from Menelaus and Helen till his departure on the ship;
9711,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"second is the end to which he is moving just now, the hut of Eumæus,"
9712,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"where are Ulysses and the swineherd, the latter of whom tells his tale"
9713,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,of discipline and is seen to be a hero too in his sphere; the third
9714,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,part is the coming of Telemachus.
9715,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,
9716,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"I. In the departure of Telemachus from Sparta, we witness the divine"
9717,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,and human elements again in co-operation. The former is represented by
9718,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"Pallas who came down to Sparta to ""remind the son of Ulysses of his"
9719,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"Return(_nostos_)."" She appears to him in the night as he lies awake"
9720,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,full of care; he is ready to see her plan and so she appears on the
9721,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"spot and tells it, not in the form of a dream. In the first place, he"
9722,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"is to hasten home in order to save his substance, which is threatened"
9723,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,with new loss through the possible marriage of Penelope with one of the
9724,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"suitors, Eurymachus. The son (through the mouth of Pallas) here shows"
9725,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"some bitter feeling toward his mother, whose mind be manifestly does"
9726,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"not understand; she is altogether too subtle for her own boy, who has"
9727,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,not seen through her disguises. In the second place Pallas warns him
9728,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"against the ambush of the Suitors, which was no doubt his own forecast"
9729,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"of the situation. In the third place, the Goddess sends him to the hut"
9730,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"of the faithful swineherd, whose character he must have already known."
9731,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,In this speech of Pallas we feel everywhere the subjective element; she
9732,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"is certainly the voice of Telemachus, yet also the voice of the"
9733,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"situation; the divine and human side easily come together, with a"
9734,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,stronger tinge of the human than is usual in Homer. Still we must not
9735,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"forget that Pallas, Goddess of Intelligence, suggests the processes of"
9736,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,mind more directly than any other deity. Thus we again see that Pallas
9737,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,is the organizer of the poem; she brings its threads together through
9738,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,her foresight; she sends Telemachus where he unites with Ulysses and
9739,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,Eumæus.
9740,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,
9741,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,The separation from Menelaus and Helen is told in the style of lofty
9742,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,hospitality. Menelaus brings as his present a wine-bowl wrought by
9743,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"divine skill, ""the work of Vulcan,"" which was given him by the king of"
9744,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,the Sidonians--another glance back to Phoenicia and its art. Helen
9745,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"gives a garment of her own making, which thou shalt preserve as ""a"
9746,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"keepsake of Helen"" till the day of thy marriage, ""when thy bride shall"
9747,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"wear it."" A most beautiful motive, worthy indeed of Helen and of"
9748,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"Helen's art; Telemachus is to transfer to his bride, and to her alone,"
9749,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"his ""keepsake of Helen,"" his memory of her, his ideal gotten during"
9750,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,this journey. Finally Helen appears as prophetess and foretells the
9751,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,total destruction of the Suitors at the hands of returning Ulysses.
9752,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"Such is the last appearance of Helen to Telemachus, giving strong"
9753,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"encouragement, suggesting in her two acts a new outlook for the youth"
9754,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,both upon Family and State. No wonder his words to her rise into
9755,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"adoration: ""Zeus so ordering, there at home I shall pray unto thee as"
9756,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"unto a God."""
9757,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,
9758,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,Telemachus in his return will not pass through Pylos lest he be delayed
9759,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,by the importunate hospitality of good old Nestor. And indeed what can
9760,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,he gain thereby? He has already seen and heard the Pylian sage. So he
9761,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,sends the latter's son home while he himself goes aboard his ship. But
9762,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"just before he sets sail, there comes ""a stranger, a seer, a fugitive,"
9763,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"having slain a man."" Theoclymenus it is, of the prophetic race of"
9764,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"Melampus, the history of which is here given. The victim of a fateful"
9765,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,deed now beseeches Telemachus for protection and receives it; the
9766,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,prophet hereafter will give his forewarnings to the Suitors. Yet he
9767,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,could not save himself from his own fate in spite of his foresight; so
9768,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,all the seers of the family of Melampus have a strain of fatality in
9769,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"them; they foreknow, but cannot master their destiny."
9770,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,
9771,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"II. The scene shifts (l. 301) to the hut of the swineherd, which is the"
9772,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,present destination of Telemachus. The reader beholds a further
9773,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"unfolding of the character of Eumæus, in fact this portion of the Book"
9774,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,might be called his discipline or preparation to take part in the
9775,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,impending enterprise.
9776,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,
9777,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,Ulysses still further tests the charity and humanity of the swineherd
9778,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,by offering to go to town in order to beg for his bread among the
9779,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"Suitors, as well as to do their menial tasks. Whereat Eumæus earnestly"
9780,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"seeks to dissuade him, reminding him of the insolence of those men and"
9781,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"of their elegant servants in livery, and assuring him that ""no one here"
9782,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"is annoyed at thy presence, neither I nor the others."" Well may Ulysses"
9783,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"respond to such a manifestation of charity. ""May thou be as dear to"
9784,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"Zeus, the Father, as thou art to me!"""
9785,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,
9786,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,The stranger now tests the swineherd's interest in and devotion to
9787,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"Laertes and Eurycleia, who are the parents of Ulysses, the old father"
9788,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,and mother of the house. So Eumæus gives an account of his relation to
9789,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"them, as well as to Ktimene, sister of Ulysses; ""with her I was reared,"
9790,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"and was honored by her mother only a little less."" Eumæus will soon"
9791,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,tell how he came so young to the family of Laertes. Indeed Ulysses is
9792,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,moved by his narrative to ask just this question. It is to be noted
9793,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,that the report of the swineherd about Penelope is not so certain;
9794,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"""from the queen I have had no kindly word or deed, since that evil fell"
9795,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"upon her house--the haughty Suitors."" Here lies one motive why Ulysses"
9796,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,must go to the palace and test Penelope. Thus Eumæus shows his love for
9797,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"the family of Ulysses, and responds deeply to the test of universal"
9798,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,charity.
9799,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,
9800,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,Very naturally rises the question as to the history of his life. What
9801,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,experience has called forth such a marvelous character? Eumæus now
9802,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"gives his fateful story. The Phoenician background is again employed,"
9803,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"with its commerce in merchandise, with its stealing and selling of"
9804,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"free, high-born people into slavery, with its navigation. The pith of"
9805,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"the story is, a Phoenician female slave, who had been stolen and"
9806,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"bought by the king of the country, plays false to her master, steals"
9807,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"his child and what valuables she can carry off, and escapes on a"
9808,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,Phoenician trading vessel after an intrigue with one of its crew. The
9809,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"captive woman avenged her wrong, but was struck on ""the seventh day by"
9810,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"Diana, archer-queen,"" for her own double guilt. Eumæus was that child,"
9811,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"also stolen and enslaved, but he is her emphatic contrast; he has been"
9812,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"able fully to digest his fate. The Phoenician galley came to Ithaca,"
9813,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"""and there Laertes purchased me."" The swineherd is of royal birth and"
9814,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,retains his more than royal character; in being the humblest he can
9815,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,rise to the highest.
9816,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,
9817,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"Interesting touches of the Phoenician traders are given: ""Sharp"
9818,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"fellows, having myriads of trinkets in their ship:"" surely it is the"
9819,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"ancient Semitic retailer of jewelry, going from town to town in his"
9820,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"boat. Then note specially ""the cunning man who came to my father's"
9821,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"house, showing a golden necklace strung with amber beads;"" this amber"
9822,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"was obtained doubtless through commerce from the Baltic, by the"
9823,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"Phoenicians, whose workmanship is also suggested. ""The palace"
9824,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"servants and my mother took the trinket into their hands, turning it"
9825,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"over and over; they kept gazing at it haggling about the price;"" the"
9826,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,same scene can be witnessed today in our own country towns when the
9827,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"Jewish peddler appears in the household. In the present case, however,"
9828,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,it was part of the scheme of stealing the child.
9829,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,
9830,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,Eumæus says that his father ruled a city in the island of Syria. But
9831,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,where is this Syria? Some think it is conceived by Homer as lying in
9832,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"the extreme West, ""where the Sun turns;"" but the Sun turns anywhere."
9833,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,Rather is its position eastward toward Phoenicia; the Taphian pirates
9834,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"who stole the Sidonian woman and sold her into Syria, dwelt not far"
9835,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"from Ithaca and preyed upon Phoenician commerce, stealing and selling"
9836,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,in the Eastern Mediterranean. Certainly they could find little business
9837,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,of their kind in the West. Some vague idea of the actual land of Syria
9838,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,must have flashed in Homer's mind; no more definite description is
9839,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,possible.
9840,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,
9841,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"It is plain, however, that the poet makes Eumæus a foreigner, not a"
9842,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"Greek, whose birth-land lies beyond the Hellenic boundary to the East."
9843,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"But he is not a Phoenician, his character is different, and his"
9844,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,people seem not to have been sea-faring. His fundamental trait is
9845,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,religiosity; he lives in the eternal presence of the Divine Ruler of
9846,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,the World. His character is that of the Old Testament; some of his
9847,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,utterances are strong reminders of the Psalms. We cannot help reading
9848,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"in him something of David and of Job; misfortune he here has had, but"
9849,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"he retains an unshaken faith in the deity; intense wrestling he shows,"
9850,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,but it has been with him the process of purification. He is not a Greek
9851,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"at all; he has a Hebrew character, not of the modern mercantile type,"
9852,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"which resembles more the Phoenician, but of the old Hebrew strain. In"
9853,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"those times of man-stealing, Homer could easily have met him in one of"
9854,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"the Greek islands, a slave yet a spiritual prince, have drawn his"
9855,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"portrait, and have heard his story substantially as here given."
9856,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,
9857,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,Indeed we think we can trace in the swineherd's thoughts and sometimes
9858,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,in his expressions a marked monotheistic tendency. Undoubtedly Eumæus
9859,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"speaks fluently of the Greek Gods, as Diana and Apollo; especially does"
9860,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"he mention and honor Zeus, the supreme God; still he is prone to employ"
9861,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"the word Gods in the unitary sense of Providence, and he repeatedly"
9862,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"uses the singular _God_ without the article, as in the passage: ""God"
9863,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"grants some things and withholds others at his will, for he is"
9864,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"all-powerful"" (XIV. 444). And it is characteristic that he does not"
9865,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"like Helen, for thus he says in an outburst of anti-Greek spirit: ""O"
9866,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"would that Helen and her tribe had utterly perished, for whose sake so"
9867,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"many fell!"" (XIV. 68.) Striking is his contrast herein with the"
9868,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"Phæacians, and with their love of the Trojan conflict."
9869,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,
9870,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"We have already stated that this entire Ithakeiad resembles the novel,"
9871,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"giving pictures of the social life of the time, and elevating the"
9872,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"humblest man into heroship. In like manner, this story of Eumæus might"
9873,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"almost be called a novelette, truly an Homeric novelette interwoven"
9874,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"into the greater totality of the novel here presented in the Ithakeiad,"
9875,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,and finally into the entire Odyssey. It has its correspondence with the
9876,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"Fairy Tale of the previous portions of the poem, yet stands in sharpest"
9877,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"contrast. Here is no supernatural world far away, but it is the"
9878,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"present, it is human life just now, and the hero lives before us. Here"
9879,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"are no superhuman beings, like Calypso, Circe, Polyphemus, Proteus; the"
9880,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"environment, the coloring, the art-form are totally changed. Nor is it"
9881,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"an heroic tale of Troy, with its order of Gods, descending and"
9882,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"interfering in human affairs; no grand exploits of arms, no mighty"
9883,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,mustering of glorious warriors. Not high and magnificent Achilles in
9884,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"all the pride of his colossal individuality, but humble Eumæus, a slave"
9885,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"and a swineherd, has become the Homeric hero. Surely a new style, and a"
9886,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"new world-view; yet surely Homer's, not the work of any other man."
9887,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,
9888,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"It has been already made plain that we have passed from the Idyl, and"
9889,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"Heroic Epos, and the Fairy Tale of the first portions of the Odyssey"
9890,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"into the Social Romance, which takes the picture of society as its"
9891,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"setting. Every human being can now be made a slave; man-stealing,"
9892,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"woman-stealing, child-stealing, give the motives for the strangest"
9893,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,turns of destiny. Already Ulysses in his fictitious tale of the
9894,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,previous Book has become a maker of the novelette; but Eumæus tells a
9895,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"true tale of his own life, it has no disguise; he knows his past, he is"
9896,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"aware of his origin. Thus he is an example, showing how the man is"
9897,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,still a fate-compeller in such a state of society. Though a slave
9898,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"externally, he can still be a king within; though struck by the hardest"
9899,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,blow of destiny he can still remain loyal to the Divine Order and
9900,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,obtain its blessing.
9901,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,
9902,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,It is interesting to note the significance of this Phoenician
9903,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"background, with its universal commerce. The Phoenician traded"
9904,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"already in remote antiquity with the extremes of the Aryan race, from"
9905,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"India in the East to Britain in the West, including the whole"
9906,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"intervening line of Aryan migration, Persia, Greece, Italy, Gaul. The"
9907,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"Aryan race is indeed a separative, self-repellent, distracted race,"
9908,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"always on the move out of itself, without returning into itself. The"
9909,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"Phoenician, on the contrary, in his farthest voyages, came back home"
9910,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,with news and merchandise; the remotest Phoenician settlements kept
9911,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,up their connection with the mother country. Deep is the idea of the
9912,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,Return to the parent city in the Semitic consciousness for all time;
9913,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,the Phoenician returned anciently to Tyre and Sidon; the Arab
9914,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"Mahommedan returns to-day to Mecca, home of the Prophet; the Jew"
9915,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"experts to return to Jerusalem, the holy city of his fathers. The"
9916,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"entire Odyssey may well be supposed to show a Semitic influence, in"
9917,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"distinction from the Iliad, for the Odyssey is the account of many"
9918,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"returns and of the one all-embracing Return to home and country. It is,"
9919,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"therefore, very suggestive that the Odyssey has this Phoenician"
9920,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"background of a world-commerce, which is only possible for a city whose"
9921,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"people, going forth, come back to it as a center. Moreover this"
9922,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,world-commerce is a kind of unification of the ever-separating Aryan
9923,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"race, a bond created through the exchange of commodities. Thus the"
9924,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,Semitic character has always shown itself as the unifier and mediator
9925,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"of Aryan peoples, first through an external tie of trade, which was the"
9926,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"work of Phoenicia, and, secondly, through the far deeper spiritual"
9927,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"tie of religion, which was the later work of Judea. The Semitic mind"
9928,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,has always been necessary to the inherently centrifugal Aryan soul in
9929,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"order to bring it back to itself from its wanderings, inner and outer,"
9930,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,and to reconcile itself with itself and with the Divine Order. The
9931,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"Semite has been and still is the priest to all Arya, by the deepest"
9932,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,necessity of the spirit.
9933,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,
9934,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,Another word we may add in this connection. The Semitic race has also
9935,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"separated itself, and shown three main branches--Phoenician, Hebrew,"
9936,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"Arab--a sea-people, a land-people, and a sand-people. In all three"
9937,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"cases, however, they have a returning and therewith a mediating"
9938,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"character. In their wildest wanderings, on water, and in the desert,"
9939,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"and in the soul, they have the power of getting back; and that which"
9940,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"they do for themselves, they aid others in doing."
9941,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,
9942,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,So much by way of tracing the universal relations of this poem with its
9943,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,Phoenician background of commerce as well as with its Semitic
9944,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"character of Eumæus. For, somehow, we cannot help seeing in this latter"
9945,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,certain traits of the old Hebrew.
9946,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,
9947,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,III. The last part of the Book returns to Telemachus and his ship; he
9948,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"has escaped the men in ambush, and has reached the Ithacan shore at a"
9949,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,distance from the palace; he sends the vessel to the town while he goes
9950,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,to the hut of the swineherd in accord with the plan of the Goddess.
9951,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,
9952,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"But he has on his hands the seer Theoclymenus, whom he first thinks of"
9953,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,sending to one of the Suitors; but when the seer utters a favorable
9954,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"prophecy, Telemachus sends him to one of his own friends for"
9955,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,entertainment. A curious touch of policy; it was well to have the
9956,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,"prophet in a friendly house, where he might be ready for service; even"
9957,_BOOK FIFTEENTH._,prophetic vision can be colored by personal attachments.

9964,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,
9965,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"This Book connects directly with the preceding Book, and brings about"
9966,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"not only the external meeting and recognition of father and son, but"
9967,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,their spiritual fusion in a common thought and purpose. The scene is
9968,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"still laid in the swineherd's hut, but the swineherd himself must be"
9969,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"eliminated at this point. The question rises, Why does the poet hold it"
9970,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,so necessary to keep the matter secret from Eumæus? The care which
9971,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"Homer takes with this object in view, is noteworthy. Evidently the"
9972,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"swineherd was not ready to participate, or would endanger the scheme."
9973,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,Yet of his fidelity there could be no question.
9974,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,
9975,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,We have already stated our opinion on this subject. Various external
9976,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,reasons may be suggested but the real reason lay in the character of
9977,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"Eumæus. He was too sincere, open-hearted, transparent for those wily"
9978,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,Greeks; he might let out the great secret in pure simplicity of mind;
9979,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"he is their contrast just herein, he is not a Greek. The situation"
9980,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"demanded disguise, dissimulation, possibly downright lying; Eumæus was"
9981,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"not the man for that. Such is his greatest honor, yet such is also his"
9982,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"limit; if Ulysses and Telemachus were such as he, they would have all"
9983,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"died nobly in their cause, but the Suitors would have triumphed, and"
9984,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,the institutional world of Ithaca would have gone to the dogs. At least
9985,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,its rescue could not have taken place through them. Such is the moral
9986,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"contradiction which now rises, and will continue to rise more and more"
9987,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,distinctly to view throughout the rest of the poem.
9988,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,
9989,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,There are the two strands in the Book which are the main ones of the
9990,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"poem, that of the father and son, and that of the Suitors. Both are"
9991,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"here put together and contrasted with new incidents, which are leading"
9992,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,inevitably to the grand culmination. These two strands we shall now
9993,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"briefly follow out in order. There is also a third portion, the return"
9994,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"of Eumaeus from the palace to the hut, which portion is short and"
9995,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,unimportant.
9996,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,
9997,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"I. Telemachus arrives at the hut of the swineherd, the dogs give him a"
9998,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,friendly greeting in contrast to that which they give to Ulysses--a
9999,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,fact which shows that the youth must have been in times past a good
10000,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,deal with Eumæus. Also the affectionate meeting of the two suggests the
10001,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,same thing. Herein we note a reason for Pallas sending him hither--the
10002,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,Goddess and the youth coincided. Of course the conversation soon turns
10003,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"toward the stranger present, the disguised Ulysses. Now occurs a subtle"
10004,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,movement between father and son who are to be brought together.
10005,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,
10006,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"(1) First they are in a state of separation, but the disguised Ulysses"
10007,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,holds the bond of unification in his power. Eumæus first tells to
10008,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,Telemachus the fictitious Cretan story concerning the stranger; then
10009,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"Ulysses gives a note of his true self: ""Would that I were Ulysses' son"
10010,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"or the hero himself!"" What then? ""I would be an evil to those Suitors."""
10011,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"Thus the father secretly stirs the spirit of the son, in fact"
10012,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,spiritually identifies himself. The son sends off the swineherd on an
10013,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"errand to Penelope, in order to announce his safe arrival from his"
10014,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,journey to the mainland. In this way one obstacle is removed--the
10015,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"swineherd; now the second obstacle, the disguise is to be stripped"
10016,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,away.
10017,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,
10018,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"(2) Herewith occurs a divine intervention, hinting the importance of"
10019,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"the present moment. Pallas appears to Ulysses, ""but Telemachus beheld"
10020,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"her not;"" Why? ""For not by any means are the Gods manifest to all men."""
10021,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"As already stated, Ulysses has the key of the situation, and sees what"
10022,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,is now to be done; Telemachus does not see and will not see till his
10023,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,father's disguise be removed. So again the Goddess Pallas appears to
10024,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,the wise man and addresses him because the two are one in thought; no
10025,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,other person not in this oneness of the human and divine can see her.
10026,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"In like manner Pallas appears to Achilles, ""seen by him alone,"" in the"
10027,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,First Book of the Iliad; similar too is the case of Telemachus when
10028,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,Pallas comes to him among the Suitors under the form of Mentes in the
10029,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,First Book of this Odyssey (see p. 26).
10030,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,
10031,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,But just here is added a fact in strangest contrast with the foregoing
10032,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"view; ""The dogs (as well as Ulysses) saw the Goddess; they barked not,"
10033,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"but ran off whining through the gate in the opposite direction."" In the"
10034,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"old Teutonic faith (and probably Aryan) the dog can see a ghost, hence"
10035,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,his unaccountable whine at times. The lower animals and even the
10036,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,elements recognize the approaching deity by some unusual commotion. But
10037,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,mark the contrast: the dogs ran in terror from the presence of the
10038,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"Goddess; Ulysses, observing her, ""went out of the house and stood"
10039,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"before her alongside the wall of the court."" The rational man,"
10040,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"beholding, must commune with the deity present, and not run off like a"
10041,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"dog. If he does not see the Goddess, as in the case with Telemachus"
10042,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"here, he is simply outside of her influence."
10043,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,
10044,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"Pallas gives to Ulysses the strong promise of help, reflecting his own"
10045,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"internal condition. She transforms him, he appears a new man, nay a God"
10046,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"to his son, ""some divinity whose home is the broad heaven."" Then the"
10047,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"recognition follows, with its various doubts and its emotional ups and"
10048,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"downs. ""In the breasts of both rose the desire of tears; they wept"
10049,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"shrilly, and louder their screams than those of the eagle whose young"
10050,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"have been stolen from its nest."" Lamentation is a trait of the Homeric"
10051,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,hero; in the present case it asserts its fullest right. But enough! let
10052,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,us pass from heroic tears to heroic deeds.
10053,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,
10054,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,(3) Next comes the general plan of action. What have we to encounter?
10055,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,Telemachus gives a catalogue of the Suitors; they reach the surprising
10056,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"number of 108 persons plus 10 attendants, including the bard and the"
10057,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,herald. We now begin to appreciate the greatness of the task. The
10058,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"Ithacan people are helpless or hostile, the Suitors have friends and"
10059,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"relatives everywhere, yet they must be punished, they cannot be allowed"
10060,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"to escape. But the aid for such an enterprise--whence? asks Telemachus,"
10061,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"and also the reader. Listen to the answer of Ulysses: ""I shall tell"
10062,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"thee, and thou bear it well in mind; think whether Pallas with her"
10063,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"father Zeus be not sufficient for us, or shall I look about for some"
10064,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"other defender?"" Such a believer has the skeptic become; he now has"
10065,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"faith in the Gods, and in a World Order. It is also a lofty expression"
10066,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"of belief in his divine mission; the spirit of Eumæus, which dwells in"
10067,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"that humble hut, has entered the heart of the hero. Such are the two"
10068,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"allies: Pallas, wisdom, and Zeus, fountain of the world's justice,"
10069,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"which had been deeply violated by the Suitors. Telemachus in response,"
10070,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"assents to his father's words, and acknowledges the supremacy of the"
10071,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,Gods. He also lays aside his doubt and shows himself in a spiritual
10072,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"harmony with his father, which must be antecedent to the deed."
10073,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,
10074,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,The next part of the plan is that Ulysses in disguise shall go to the
10075,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"palace and see for himself the wrongs done to his House, and experience"
10076,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,some of these wrongs in his own person. Then too he can make
10077,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,preparations on the spot and select the time for striking. Also he
10078,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,wishes to test a little further the wife Penelope. Another period of
10079,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,disguise is necessary in order to get rid of the necessity of disguise
10080,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"and vindicate the right. Zeus is with him, he is the bearer of"
10081,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"universal justice, which he is to establish anew; but Pallas must also"
10082,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"be with him in the act, for it requires all his skill and cunning and"
10083,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,forethought.
10084,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,
10085,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"Thus the father and son are united in spirit; the last obstacle, which"
10086,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"was the disguise, is removed, and they behold each other as they are in"
10087,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"truth. The recognition is not merely an external one of face and form,"
10088,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,or even of the tie of kinship and affection; it is in both a
10089,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"recognition of the Divine Order of the World, which they are now called"
10090,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"upon to maintain in their own persons, and to re-stablish in their"
10091,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,country.
10092,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,
10093,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"II. The scene passes from the hut of the swineherd to the palace, where"
10094,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,the Suitors soon hear of the safe return of Telemachus. Antinous also
10095,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"comes back, foiled and evidently angered; he proposes to the Suitors"
10096,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"that they should slay Telemachus ""in the fields or on the highway"""
10097,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"wherever found, or renounce the suit for Penelope in the palace: ""Let"
10098,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"each one woo her from his own house with gifts."""
10099,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,
10100,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,It is clear that such a violent measure as the assassination of the
10101,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,royal heir in his own territory finds small response even among the
10102,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,Suitors. Antinous says that the people are no longer friendly; he
10103,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"thinks, when they hear of the recent ambush, that they may rise and"
10104,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"drive out the aggressors. Still they do not rise, and probably Antinous"
10105,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,tried to frighten the Suitors into his drastic method. But he did not
10106,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"succeed, Amphinomus clearly voices their sentiment, and the council"
10107,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,dissolves.
10108,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,
10109,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,Soon it is seen that Antinous has lost his cause. Penelope appears and
10110,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"gives him a thorough tongue-lashing, in which she also tells his"
10111,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"antecedents. ""Thy father came to us, a fugitive from the people,"" who"
10112,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"were angry at him on account of his piratical misdeeds; ""they wanted to"
10113,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"kill him, and tear out his heart, and pillage his large wealth"""
10114,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"evidently gotten unlawfully. ""But Ulysses restrained them,"" and now"
10115,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"this is your gratitude: ""you waste his property, woo his wife, slay his"
10116,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"son, and worry me to death."" Antinous is true to his ancestry, he is"
10117,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"still a pirate. Strong words are these, which call forth a hypocritical"
10118,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"reply from another Suitor, Eurymachus, which she probably saw through,"
10119,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"for she goes into her upper chamber, where ""she weeps for her dear"
10120,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"spouse Ulysses, till blue-eyed Pallas cast upon her eyelids sweet"
10121,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"sleep."""
10122,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,
10123,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,The internal weakness of the Suitors is exposed; it is manifest that
10124,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"they are divided among themselves. In fact, how can they have any"
10125,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"unity? Each wishes to win the fair prize, which can belong only to one;"
10126,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"hence every other man is his rival, whom he tries to thwart. Hence come"
10127,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,jealousy and suspicion. The single bond they have in common is their
10128,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"wrong-doing, which they feel cannot much longer continue, with"
10129,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,Telemachus so active.
10130,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,
10131,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"III. On the other hand, we pass to the hut of the swineherd, where the"
10132,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,father and son show a complete unity of spirit and purpose. Eumæus
10133,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,returns from his errand; he brings no news specially except that the
10134,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,Suitors who formed the ambush have come back to the town. But he is not
10135,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,yet to be admitted into the grand secret; so Pallas stood again near
10136,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"Ulysses, ""striking him with her staff she made him an old man in"
10137,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"wretched rags."" He resumes his disguise ""lest the swineherd might"
10138,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"recognize him and hasten to announce the fact to Penelope, instead of"
10139,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,"keeping the secret looked in his bosom."" So the kind-hearted, sincere"
10140,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,Eumæus cannot yet be entrusted with the important secret.
10141,_BOOK SIXTEENTH._,

10145,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._
10146,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10147,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10148,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,The time has arrived for this exposition of the Odyssey to be brought
10149,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,to a close with some degree of rapidity. It has already expanded itself
10150,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"beyond its original purpose; it, too, like Ulysses, has asserted itself"
10151,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,as limit-transcending. We shall try to indicate the general character
10152,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"of these remaining eight Books, to find their place in the total"
10153,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"organism of the poem, and then give a brief outline of each Book"
10154,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,separately.
10155,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10156,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"It has already often been stated that the Odyssey is a Return, an"
10157,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"outer, but specially an inner Return from the Trojan War and from the"
10158,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"alienation and disruption produced by the same. This Return, narrated"
10159,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"in the twenty-four Books of the poem, divides itself into two equal"
10160,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"halves, each containing twelve Books. The first half moves about two"
10161,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"centers, Telemachus and Ulysses; the former is to be trained out of his"
10162,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"ignorance, the latter is to be disciplined out of his negative"
10163,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"attitude toward institutional life, and thus be prepared to rescue"
10164,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"institutional life. The first twelve Books are, therefore, the getting"
10165,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"rid of the destructive results caused by the Trojan War and all war, in"
10166,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,the human soul.
10167,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10168,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Still Ulysses, with Telemachus, is to do a deed of destruction, he is"
10169,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"to destroy the Suitors, who are themselves destructive of institutional"
10170,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"order in Ithaca. In a general way they are like the Trojans, they are"
10171,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,assailing the domestic and political life of the Greek world; they too
10172,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"must be put down at home by the hero, as Troy was put down abroad by"
10173,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,him. But at Troy he became negative through the long training of a ten
10174,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"years' war, the spirit of which he must get rid of before he can slay"
10175,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the Suitors, for he is too much like them to be their rightful"
10176,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"destroyer. This, then, is the discipline of the first twelve Books:"
10177,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,through the experience of life to get internally free of that
10178,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"destructive Trojan spirit, to overcome the negative within, and then"
10179,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,proceed to overcome it without.
10180,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10181,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Now this overcoming of the negative without (embodied in the Suitors)
10182,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"is just the work of the last twelve Books of the Odyssey, which we have"
10183,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"called the Ithakeiad, as the scene is laid wholly in Ithaca. Internally"
10184,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,both Ulysses and Telemachus are ready; they have now externally to make
10185,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,their world conform to their Idea. The trend of the poem is henceforth
10186,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"toward the deed which destroys the outer negation, as hitherto the"
10187,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,trend was toward the deed which overcame the inner negation. To be
10188,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"sure, the destruction of the Suitors has hovered before the poem from"
10189,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the beginning; but in the second half it is explicit, is the immediate"
10190,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,end of the action.
10191,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10192,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,This second half divides itself into two distinct portions. It being
10193,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,the direct movement toward the deed shows in the first portion the
10194,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"preparation of the instruments, which takes place at the hut of the"
10195,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"swineherd. Ulysses is alone, he must find out upon whose aid he can"
10196,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"rely; his helpers must show not only strength of limb, but strength of"
10197,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,conviction. Two persons appear--his son and his swineherd; they believe
10198,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,themselves to be the bearers of a Divine Order as against the Suitors;
10199,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,they are the army of three to whom the cowherd is to be hereafter added
10200,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,on manifesting his loyalty. This part of the poem has been unfolded in
10201,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,the preceding four Books.
10202,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10203,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"The second portion of this second half of the poem, consisting of eight"
10204,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Books, we are next to consider. Ulysses has hitherto only heard of the"
10205,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,excesses of the Suitors; he is now to see them directly and to
10206,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,experience their violence in his own person. He is in disguise and gets
10207,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,full possession of the fact before he proceeds to the deed. The
10208,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"insolent, destructive conduct of the Suitors is set forth in all"
10209,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"fullness, as well as the subtle attempt of the wife to thwart them;"
10210,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,then the blow falls which sweeps them and their deeds out of existence.
10211,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Restoration follows after this terrible act of vengence; Ulysses,"
10212,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"having done his great destructive work, is to show himself"
10213,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"constructive, not simply the destroyer, but the healer and restorer."
10214,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10215,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,How can we best see the sweep of these eight Books and their organic
10216,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"connection with the total Odyssey? No mere formal division will answer,"
10217,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,nor any external separation into parts. The inner movement of the
10218,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,thought is to be found and shown as the organizing principle. On the
10219,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,whole the joints of the structure are not so manifest as in the
10220,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Telemachiad and the Ulyssiad; still they exist. Already it has been
10221,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,often said that the essential character of the Suitors is that of
10222,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,destroyers; Ulysses is the destroyer of these destroyers; but in
10223,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,destroying destruction he is also the restorer. Now just these three
10224,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,stages of the movement of the inner thought are the three organic
10225,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"divisions of the last eight Books; that is, the thought organizes the"
10226,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,poem. Let us look more closely.
10227,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10228,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,I. The first five Books (XVII-XXI) are devoted to revealing the Suitors
10229,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"as destroyers to Ulysses in person, though he be disguised. Three"
10230,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"strands are interwoven into the texture, which we may separate for the"
10231,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,purpose of an examination.
10232,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10233,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,1. The Suitors are destroying what may in general be called the
10234,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"institutional world in its three leading forms: (1) Property, (2)"
10235,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Family, (3) State. To these may be added their disregard and even open"
10236,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"defiance of the Gods, who are the upholders, or rather the personified"
10237,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,embodiment of all institutional life. Hence the statement may be made
10238,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"that the Suitors are, as far as their deeds go, the destroyers of the"
10239,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Divine Order of the World; they are spiritually negative.
10240,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10241,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,2. The second strand is that of Ulysses (to whom Telemachus and the
10242,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"swineherd can be added) who is to behold with his own eyes, to"
10243,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"experience in his own person, the character and acts of the Suitors;"
10244,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,then he is also to plan and prepare for their destruction. As he has
10245,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"overcome his own negative condition inwardly, in the spirit, he must be"
10246,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"able to overcome the same condition outwardly, in the world."
10247,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10248,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"3. The third strand is that of Penelope, the wife, who is seeking to"
10249,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,thwart the attempt of the Suitors to make her marry one of themselves;
10250,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"thus she is heroically preserving the Family. She, with the loyal part"
10251,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"of her household, co-operates with Ulysses, though not aware who he is."
10252,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Between the second and third strands are many interweavings, both being"
10253,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"opposed to the Suitors. Penelope, to delay her marriage, proposes the"
10254,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Bending of the Bow, which gives the weapon and the opportunity to"
10255,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Ulysses. (Book XXI.)
10256,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10257,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,II. The second stage of the grand movement is given in one Book (XXII).
10258,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"This is the single bloody Book of the poem, it makes up all"
10259,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,deficiencies in the way of sanguinary grewsomeness. The destroying
10260,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Suitors are themselves destroyed by Ulysses, who therein is destroyer."
10261,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Hence the blood-letting character of the Book and of the deed; 116 men
10262,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"skin, 12 women hung, and one man mutilated unto death."
10263,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10264,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"III. But the destroyer Ulysses destroys destruction, and so becomes"
10265,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,positive; in the last two Books he is shown as the restorer of the
10266,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,institutional order which the Suitors had assailed and were
10267,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"undermining. He restores the Family (Book XXIII), and the State (Book"
10268,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"XXIV). This is, then, the end of the Return, indeed the end of the"
10269,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"grand disruption caused by the Trojan War, to which Ulysses set out"
10270,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,from Ithaca twenty years before. The absence of the husband and ruler
10271,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,from home and country gave the opportunity for the license of the
10272,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Suitors. But the Return has harmonized the distracted condition of the
10273,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"land; institutions, Family and State, are freed of their conflict; even"
10274,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the Gods, Zeus and Pallas (authority and wisdom) enforce the new order,"
10275,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,bringing peace and concord.
10276,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10277,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Still, despite the bloody death of the Suitors, there runs through this"
10278,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"portion of the Odyssey (the last eight Books) a vein of charity, of"
10279,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"humanity, sometimes even of sentiment, which seems to link the poem"
10280,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,with our own age. Yet the other side is present also; there is little
10281,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"pity for the unrighteous, and justice is capable of becoming cruel. The"
10282,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Suitors and their set of servants are represented as unfeeling and
10283,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,inhuman; Penelope and the whole loyal household on the other hand show
10284,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"sympathy with poverty and misfortune. Such, indeed, has been their"
10285,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"discipline, that of adversity, which softens the heart toward the"
10286,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,victims of hard luck.
10287,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10288,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"The disguise of Ulysses is continued, and also the craft of Penelope."
10289,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,The moral questioning which these two characters have always roused
10290,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,does not diminish. The hardest practical problem of life comes to the
10291,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,front in their case. Both are willing to meet unjust violence with
10292,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"dissimulation, till they get the power to act openly. They put down a"
10293,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"dishonest world with dishonesty, and then proceed to live honestly. It"
10294,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"is another phase of that subtle play of the Negative, with which"
10295,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Ulysses had to grapple repeatedly in Fableland, and of which the"
10296,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Odyssey is full. Every situation seems to have its intricate ethical
10297,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"problem, which the reader has to solve as he solves such questions in"
10298,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,actual life. Our opinion upon this element in the poem we have already
10299,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"given, and need not repeat it here."
10300,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10301,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,We must note that Ulysses still keeps up his romancing in order to
10302,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,explain his presence in Ithaca and his beggarly appearance. He
10303,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"introduces a kind of story, which we have called the Novelette in"
10304,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,distinction from the Fairy Tale. The scene is usually thrown back
10305,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"eastward to Crete, the Trojan War furnishes the background, the famous"
10306,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Cretan hero Idomeneus is usually in some way connected with the
10307,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,stranger who is speaking. No less than five such Novelettes are found
10308,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"in the last twelve Books--some long, some brief. He tells one to Pallas"
10309,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"(XIII. 256), to Eumæus the longest one (XIV. 199), to Antinous a short"
10310,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"interrupted one (XVII. 425), to Penelope (XIX. 172), finally one to his"
10311,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"father Laertes (XXIV. 304), in which the scene seems to be changed to"
10312,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,the West from the mention of Sicania.
10313,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10314,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"For the reader who may wish to follow out in detail these eight Books,"
10315,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"we append a general survey of each, in which the thought and the"
10316,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"structure are suggested, yet by no means elaborated. We have in the"
10317,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,preceding pages given quite fully what we deem the main points of the
10318,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Odyssey; there remains only this winding-up of the work in a rapid
10319,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,summary.
10320,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10321,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,_Book Seventeenth._ We now pass from the country and the hut of the
10322,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,swineherd to the town and the palace of the king. This is an important
10323,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"transition, and evidently marks a turning-point in the last twelve"
10324,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Books of the Odyssey. The change of location brings us to the scene of
10325,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the forthcoming deed, and into the presence of the two conflicting"
10326,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"sides. The structure of the Book moves about two centers, Telemachus"
10327,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,and Ulysses.
10328,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10329,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"I. Telemachus is first to start for the city, where he arrives, and is"
10330,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,received with great joy by the household. The mother asks him whether
10331,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"he has obtained any tidings from his father. But he shuns her question,"
10332,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"bids her make fresh vows to the Gods, and goes off to look after his"
10333,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"guest, the prophet Theoclymenus. The Suitors throng about him, but do"
10334,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"him no harm; a number of his friends are near at hand, and the Suitors"
10335,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,are divided among themselves.
10336,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10337,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"After his return to the palace, Telemachus tells his mother the story"
10338,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"of his journey. First he went to Pylos and ""saw Nestor there,"" and held"
10339,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"intercourse with the wise old man of the Greeks, which was certainly a"
10340,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,memorable event in the life of the youth. But Nestor could tell him
10341,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"nothing about the present condition or dwelling-place of Ulysses, so"
10342,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the son was sent onwards to Sparta, to Menelaus, where ""I saw Argive"
10343,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Helen, for whose sake the Greeks and Trojans suffered many evils by"
10344,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"will of the Gods."" Menelaus tells Telemachus the words of Proteus"
10345,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"concerning his father Ulysses, gently touching the story of the nymph"
10346,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Calypso, whereat the queen was deeply moved. His news is that his"
10347,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,father cannot return.
10348,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10349,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"At this point the prophet comes in with his prophecy. ""I declare that"
10350,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Ulysses in his own land again, sitting or creeping about in secret; he"
10351,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"is taking note of these evil deeds just now, and plans destruction for"
10352,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the Suitors."" The response of Penelope shows her mind. ""May thy"
10353,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"prophetic word be fulfilled!"" It is well to note the art with which"
10354,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,this prophet has been brought to the palace of Ulysses to foreshadow
10355,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,the coming event.
10356,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10357,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Moreover this whole passage connects with the Third and Fourth Books,"
10358,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,which recounted the Journey of Telemachus to Pylos and Sparta. Of
10359,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,course the school of dissectors have sought to show the entire
10360,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,narrative here to be an interpolation by a later hand. One says that
10361,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,the brief allusion to the trip is tiresome to the reader. As if Homer
10362,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,composed for readers! But what reader ever found these few lines
10363,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,tiresome? The whole account of the son to the mother is one of the
10364,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"links which bind the Odyssey into unity, hence the wrath against it in"
10365,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,certain quarters.
10366,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10367,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"II. The second part of the present Book gives the movements of Ulysses,"
10368,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,and is more important and more fully elaborated than the preceding
10369,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"part. The hero is in disguise, he is to take his first glimpse of the"
10370,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,state of affairs in his palace. He will experience in his own person
10371,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,the wrongs of the Suitors and their adherents; he will apply a test to
10372,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"bring out their character. This test is that of humanity, of charity"
10373,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,toward a beggar; how will the Suitors behave toward him?
10374,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10375,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"While he is on the way to the city with Eumæus, he has his preliminary"
10376,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"skirmish. They meet the goatherd Melanthius, who at the sight of the"
10377,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"beggar breaks out into abuse. There is an inhuman note in his speech,"
10378,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,which we may regard as one result of the present disorder of the
10379,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"country. Doubtless the swineherd and the goatherd were rivals, and"
10380,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,showed a professional jealousy; but Melanthius had extracted from his
10381,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"humble calling a disposition quite opposite to that of Eumæus, and had"
10382,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,become disloyal to his master's House.
10383,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10384,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,The approach to the palace is indicated by the song of the bard and the
10385,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,noise of feasting guests. Still the disguised Ulysses is recognized by
10386,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"one living object: his old dog Argo, who dies on the spot out of joy at"
10387,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,seeing his master again. Full of sentiment and tenderness is the
10388,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,description; it has a modernity of touch which will be often noticed in
10389,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,this second half of the Odyssey. Much comment has been bestowed upon
10390,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,the incident; but its most striking characteristic is its symbolism.
10391,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"The old dog, neglected now, full of vermin, hardly able to crawl, yet"
10392,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"loyal in his heart; why should he not receive the praise of Eumæus, who"
10393,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,tells of his former skill in the chase! The dog Argo images the House
10394,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,of Ulysses at present; to such straits has fidelity come. A famous
10395,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"statement here by Eumæus cannot be passed over: ""The day which makes"
10396,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the man a slave, Zeus takes half his worth away."" True generally of"
10397,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"men, but not of the slave who utters it, he being the fate-compeller."
10398,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10399,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Ulysses now applies his test of charity to the Suitors. He goes around
10400,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"to them, asking for alms, like a beggar, that he might observe them"
10401,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"all, and ""know who was better and who was worse."" But in the end not"
10402,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"one of them was to be spared. Such was the supreme test, that of"
10403,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,charity; how will the Suitors treat the poor beggar? Will they behave
10404,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,toward him as Eumæus has? Not by any means; the test calls out the
10405,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"worst suitor of the lot, Antinous, who finally hurls a stool at the"
10406,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"supposed intruder. The other Suitors give something, not their own;"
10407,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"still they share in the guilt. Is this test of charity, selected by the"
10408,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"poet here, a true test of such characters? One result of the present"
10409,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"violation of law and order is inhumanity, cruelty, disregard of the"
10410,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"fellow-man. Especially marked is their contrast with Eumæus, who, in"
10411,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"response to the harshness of Antinous, says: ""The famous men of earth"
10412,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"(such as the seer, the doctor, the builder, the bard) are invited to"
10413,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the feast; no one would invite a beggar to an entertainment."" Still the"
10414,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,beggar is here to be invited. A ring of modern sentiment is surely
10415,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,heard in this passage; the subjective element of Christendom seems
10416,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,embodied in that swineherd a thousand years before its time.
10417,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10418,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,The poet does not leave out of this Book the previous tendency of
10419,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Ulysses to romancing. In the talk with Antinous he begins another tale
10420,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"or rather the old one, with Egypt and Cyprus in the background. It is,"
10421,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"in substance, the story of the attack on the Ciconians, which Ulysses"
10422,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,cannot help telling when he looks back toward his Trojan period. Here
10423,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,again it is truth in the form of fiction.
10424,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10425,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Meantime the uproar has called forth Penelope, who desires to see the"
10426,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"strange beggar. The wish is conveyed to Ulysses, who artfully requests"
10427,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,that the interview be deferred till night-fall; the wife might see
10428,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,through his disguise. The time for this recognition has not yet come.
10429,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"She wishes to hear of her husband, thinks of him in some such pitiable"
10430,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,plight as this beggar is in; she shows sympathy. A charitable
10431,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"disposition is indeed a characteristic of the whole household, nurses"
10432,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,and all; misfortune has brought its blessing. Herein the contrast with
10433,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the Suitors is emphatic, they are a stony-hearted set, trained by their"
10434,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,deeds to violence and inhumanity.
10435,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10436,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Eumæus praises the minstrel talent of Ulysses; the poet endows his hero
10437,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,with the gift of song in this poem; compare the praise given by
10438,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Alcinous to the singer of Fableland. So Achilles in the Iliad was found
10439,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,by the embassy singing the glory of heroes. Nor must we pass by that
10440,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,deeply-grounded belief in the good-luck which comes from a sneeze.
10441,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Telemachus sneezes at the right moment, and Penelope interprets the"
10442,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"omen, with a smile, however, which hints a touch of humorous"
10443,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,incredulity. Finally we may reflect upon that true Homeric view of the
10444,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"world indicated in the words of Telemachus: ""All these matters will be"
10445,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"cared for by myself and the Immortals."" These are the two sides working"
10446,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,together throughout the poem.
10447,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10448,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"_Book Eighteenth._ Ulysses, as beggar, has now gotten a foothold in his"
10449,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,own house. He has made the transition in disguise from the hut to the
10450,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"palace; he has tried his preliminary test upon the Suitors, the test of"
10451,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"charity, and found out their general character. He is not recognized,"
10452,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,on account of external disguise in part; yet this disguise has its
10453,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,internal correspondence.
10454,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10455,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,The present Book is one of warnings; on all sides the Suitors are
10456,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,admonished of the day of wrath which is coming. In Homeric fashion they
10457,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"are told to change, to repent, to cease their wrong-doing. We observe"
10458,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"three parts: first is the conflict with the beggar Irus, foreshadowing"
10459,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,the conflict and outcome with the Suitors; second is the appearance of
10460,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Penelope, the female Ulysses in craft and in disguise, here hoodwinking"
10461,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the Suitors; third is the male Ulysses, in craft and in disguise,"
10462,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"observing, testing, planning fate for the guilty."
10463,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10464,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"I. Ulysses has assumed the part of a beggar, but he finds a real beggar"
10465,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"on the ground ready to dispute his right. Irus, this mendicant, has a"
10466,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"character on a par with the Suitors, violent, inhuman, insolent; he is,"
10467,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"moreover, one with the Suitors in taking other people's property for"
10468,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,nothing. There is no doubt that the poet casts an image of the Suitors
10469,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"in the portrait of Irus, who acts toward Ulysses the beggar, as they do"
10470,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,toward Ulysses the ruler. It is manifest by word and deed that his
10471,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,humble life has not given him the training to charity.
10472,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10473,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,The result of the competition between the real and the disguised beggar
10474,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"is a fight, which is urged on by the Suitors for the sport of the"
10475,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"thing; Antinous is specially active in this business, which is a"
10476,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,degraded Olympic contest. Homer too shows his love of the athlete by
10477,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"his warm description of the body and limbs of Ulysses, who ""showed his"
10478,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"large and shapely thighs, his full broad shoulders, his chest and"
10479,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"sinewy arms,"" when he stripped for the contest."
10480,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10481,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"There can be only one outcome of such a fight under such circumstances,"
10482,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,especially in an heroic poem. But is not Ulysses himself inhuman and
10483,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,uncharitable toward his poor beggar rival? Certainly he does not deal
10484,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"with him gently, and the modern reader is apt to think that Ulysses"
10485,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,ought now to have his own test of charity applied to himself. Still his
10486,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"defense is at hand: Irus sided with the Suitors, had their character,"
10487,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Telemachus says they favored him; he is harsh and merciless to his
10488,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"seeming fellow-beggar, and so he gets his own, though Ulysses at first"
10489,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"warns him, and wishes to be on good terms with him: ""I do not speak or"
10490,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"do thee any wrong, nor do I envy thee getting alms; this threshold is"
10491,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,large enough for both of us; thou art a beggar as well as I. So beware
10492,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"my wrath."" Surely a sufficient warning, which, if unheeded, draws down"
10493,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,the fateful consequences.
10494,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10495,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,But the chief justification of the poet lies in the fact that this
10496,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,contest with Irus is sent before the main conflict as a prototype and a
10497,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,warning. The Suitors looked on and saw the miserable beggar completely
10498,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"undone; ""they threw up their hands and nearly died laughing;"" a case of"
10499,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"blind fatuity, for they were soon to be in the place of Irus, every one"
10500,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"of them. A little later Telemachus suggests the connection: ""Would that"
10501,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the Suitors might droop their heads overcome in our house, as now Irus"
10502,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"sits at the hall gate with drooping head like a drunken man, and cannot"
10503,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"stand erect or walk home, since his dear limbs have been loosened."""
10504,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10505,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Another note of warning is given specially to Amphinomus, who had"
10506,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"extended a very friendly salutation to Ulysses after the victory, and"
10507,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,who was the most honorable man of the Suitors. Ulysses again resorts to
10508,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"fiction in order to convey his lesson, ""Many were the wrongs I did;"""
10509,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"hence my present condition. ""Let no men ever work injustice,"" such as"
10510,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"these Suitors are guilty of; the avenger ""I now declare to be not far"
10511,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"away from his friends and his country."" Hence the warning: ""May some"
10512,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"God bring thee home"" at once, for bloody will be the decision. But"
10513,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Amphinomus does not obey, though ""his mind foreboded evil;"" he remained"
10514,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,in the fateful company and afterwards fell by the hand of Telemachus.
10515,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10516,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,II. The real person for whose possession this whole contest is waged is
10517,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,now introduced--Penelope. She appears in all her beauty; Pallas
10518,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"interferes divinely in order to heighten the same, making her ""more"
10519,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"stately in form and fairer than the ivory just carved."" She is indeed"
10520,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,the embodiment of all that is beautiful and worthy in that Ithacan
10521,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"life; loyalty to husband, love of her child, devotion to family, the"
10522,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"strongest institutional feeling she shows, with no small degree of"
10523,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"artifice, of course. Just now she reproves her son for having permitted"
10524,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the recent fight: ""thou hast allowed a stranger guest to be shamefully"
10525,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"treated."" Thus she shows her secret unconscious sympathy with her"
10526,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,husband in disguise.
10527,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10528,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Then she turns her attention to the Suitors. She alludes to the parting
10529,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"words of her husband as he set out for Troy: ""When thou seest thy son a"
10530,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"bearded man, marry whom thou wilt and leave the house."" The time has"
10531,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,come when she has to endure this hateful marriage; how the thought
10532,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,weighs upon her heart! But we catch a glimpse of her deeper plan in the
10533,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"following: ""The custom of Suitors in the olden time was not such as"
10534,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,yours; they would bring along their own oxen and sheep and make a feast
10535,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"for the friends of the maiden whom they wooed, and give her splendid"
10536,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"gifts; they consumed not other folk's property without recompense."""
10537,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,What does all this mean?
10538,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10539,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,One result takes place at once. The Suitors all hasten to bring her
10540,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"their presents, and thus conform to the good old time and to her"
10541,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"opinion. Great was the hurry: ""Each dispatched his herald to bring a"
10542,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"gift."" Does the poet hint through a side glance the real state of the"
10543,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"case? Hear him: ""Ulysses wad delighted when he saw her wheedling the"
10544,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Suitors out of their gifts and cajoling their mind with flattering
10545,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"speech, while her heart planned other things."" Cunning indeed she has"
10546,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,and boundless artifice; what shall we make of her? As already often
10547,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"said, craft is her sole woman's weapon against man's violence, and she"
10548,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,uses it with effect for the defense of her home and her honor. Is she
10549,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,justified? Is such deception allowable under the circumstances? Thus
10550,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the poem puts the test to the modern reader, and makes him ponder the"
10551,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,moral problem of life.
10552,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10553,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,One other point we should note in this speech of Penelope to the
10554,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Suitors. She says that their method of wooing was not the accustomed
10555,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,way; they had no right to expect such entertainment for such a body of
10556,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"men. They had the right of suit, but it must be conducted in a lawful"
10557,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"manner. Thus they are violating custom, or making it a pretext for"
10558,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"doing injustice. But she meets violence with cunning, and rude force"
10559,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,with craft.
10560,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10561,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,III. Ulysses now takes note of another phase of the wrong done to his
10562,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"household by the Suitors; they debauch the female servants, of whom"
10563,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Melantho is an example. The seeming beggar wishes to stay all night by
10564,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the fires kindled in the palace, and take care of them, instead of the"
10565,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,maids who usually looked after them. This plan of his evidently
10566,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"interferes with an existing arrangement, hence the abusive words of"
10567,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Melantho toward him first, and then the scoffing speech of Eurynomus,"
10568,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"her lover, who lets fly at him a footstool which hits the cupbearer."
10569,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"General confusion results, in the midst of which Telemachus commands"
10570,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"order which is seconded by Amphinomus. After a cup of wine, all retire"
10571,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,to their homes. But Ulysses has got an inkling of what is transpiring
10572,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,between the Suitors and some of the maid-servants. Hereafter we shall
10573,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,see that both share in the punishment.
10574,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10575,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,_Book Nineteenth._ This is a strong Book of its kind. Penelope is the
10576,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"center, her difficulties are shown anew, moreover they are about to"
10577,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"reach their culmination. The husband disguised here tests the wife, and"
10578,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,finds out by his own personal observation her fidelity. Her womanly
10579,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"instincts are still intact, in spite of the dissolute surroundings."
10580,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Ulysses discovers that he is not to meet with the fate of Agamemnon on
10581,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,his return home.
10582,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10583,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"From the preceding Book, which was occupied with the external conflicts"
10584,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"in the palace, we move in the present Book more and more to the heart"
10585,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"of the business, which is the union in the hearts of husband and wife."
10586,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,The oneness of the Family after long separation of its two members is
10587,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the ethical theme, showing that such union is eternal, as far as the"
10588,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,eternal can be shown in Time. Two divisions we shall mark: Ulysses and
10589,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"his son Telemachus first, then Ulysses and his wife Penelope."
10590,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10591,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"I. The two men, father and son, are seen preparing for the conflict"
10592,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,which is drawing on--just that being the duty of men. The weapons which
10593,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,were hanging on the walls of the banqueting-room are removed in the
10594,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,absence of the Suitors and of the servants. Also a pretext is framed
10595,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"for their removal. Moreover ""Pallas, holding before them her golden"
10596,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"lamp, made very beautiful light."" Certainly the Goddess was there, the"
10597,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"scene shows her in every part; ""Such is the wont of the Olympians,"""
10598,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,says Ulysses; divine illumination descends upon a work of this kind.
10599,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10600,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,II. But by far the longest portion of the Book is devoted to the
10601,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,interview between Ulysses and Penelope. Telemachus goes off to his
10602,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,chamber to rest for the night; Ulysses is now received by his wife at
10603,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,the hearth. The various turns of this lengthy account we shall throw
10604,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,into four divisions.
10605,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10606,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"1. By way of introduction, the faithless handmaid Melantho again shows"
10607,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"her character in a harsh speech to Ulysses, ""Get out, you beggar! Will"
10608,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"you still keep sneaking through the house by night to spy out women?"""
10609,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"So she reveals plainly what she is, and even mentions the test which"
10610,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"she cannot stand. Ulysses in his reply enforces charity: ""I was once"
10611,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"rich, but I gave the poor wanderer alms."" Beware of the day of"
10612,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,reckoning: such is his repeated warning to all these people.
10613,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10614,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Penelope also gives a sharp reproof to the shameless handmaid, and"
10615,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"intimates the fate impending: ""Thou hast done a deed which thy head"
10616,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"shall atone for."" It is again to be noted that the guilty are the"
10617,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"inhuman, while the faithful have charity. Penelope specially shows this"
10618,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"trait in the present Book, though her threat to Melantho is not gentle."
10619,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Quite as Ulysses served Irus, Penelope is ready to serve Melantho; both"
10620,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,can become uncharitable toward the uncharitable; both can meet evil
10621,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"with evil, and fight the negative with negation."
10622,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10623,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,2. The main purpose of this portion of the interview is to furnish
10624,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Penelope with hope. She seems on the point of giving up the long
10625,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"contest, she has played her last stratagem against the Suitors. Now she"
10626,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"must choose one of them, her parents urge it, her son demands it; there"
10627,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"seems no escape, though she hates the marriage like black Death. In"
10628,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"such a frame of mind, the disguised Ulysses is to divert her thoughts"
10629,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"with a story, to gain her confidence in his honesty, and to give a"
10630,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,strong promise of her husband's speedy return. The manner in which he
10631,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,puts these three points in succession is worthy of study.
10632,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10633,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"First, he must give some account of himself, of his lineage and of his"
10634,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"connections. Here he employs his old fiction, he feigns a tale, putting"
10635,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the scene into Crete, and allying himself with the famous stock of"
10636,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Minos, as well as with the well-known Cretan hero Idomeneus so often"
10637,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"celebrated in the Iliad, whose brother he claimed to be. ""There I saw"
10638,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Ulysses and entertained him."" This story of his life has an analogy to"
10639,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,what he told Eumæus (Book XIV. 199) and Antinous (Book XVII. 425). All
10640,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"three differ in details, being adjusted to the person and the occasion;"
10641,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"still all are cast into the same general mould, with the scene placed"
10642,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,in the East on the borderland toward Phenicia and with the Trojan war
10643,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,in the background. It is another Homeric novelette suggesting a life of
10644,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"adventure on sea and land, and showing sparks of that enterprising"
10645,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Greek spirit, of which the Odyssey is the best record. But the poet"
10646,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"adds: ""So he went on fabricating lies like truth;"" which indicates that"
10647,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,he told more than is in the text and completed his story.
10648,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10649,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"In the second place, Penelope applies her test, for she is not so"
10650,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"credulous as to believe every wandering story-teller: ""Describe me the"
10651,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"garments he had on."" Truly a woman's test. It is needless to say that"
10652,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Ulysses responds with great precision. She, however, had no suspicion,"
10653,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,which might arise from such a complete account. It is no wonder that
10654,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Penelope proposed to entertain this beggar guest, one who has been so"
10655,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"hospitable to her husband, of whom she declares in an outburst of"
10656,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"despair: ""I never shall behold him returning home."""
10657,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10658,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,At this point the disguised Ulysses makes his third and principal
10659,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"speech to his wife, imparting to her the hope that Ulysses will return."
10660,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"This completes his story, introducing the Thesprotians again (as in"
10661,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,other tales) and the oracle of Dodona. He almost lets the secret out:
10662,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"""He is alive and will soon be here; not far off is he now, I swear it."""
10663,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Not much further could disguise be carried. Still Penelope remains
10664,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"skeptical: ""I must think he will not come home."" Her hard lot, however,"
10665,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"has not hardened her heart, but softened it rather; she reveals her"
10666,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,native character in the words here spoken (Bryant's Translation):--
10667,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10668,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Short is the life of man, and whoso bears"
10669,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"A cruel heart, devising cruel things,"
10670,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,On him men call down evil from the gods
10671,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"While living, and pursue him when he dies,"
10672,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"With scoffs. But whoso is of generous heart,"
10673,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"And harbors generous aims, his guests proclaim"
10674,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"His praises far and wide to all mankind,"
10675,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,And numberless are they who call him good.
10676,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10677,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"3. Having been brought so near to a discovery, we next come to an"
10678,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,actual discovery by the nurse Eurycleia. She is commanded by Penelope
10679,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"to bathe the beggar's feet, which she does with no little sympathy and"
10680,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,lamentation. The character of the nurse is in a certain sense the echo
10681,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"of that of Penelope, the echo in emotion, and in fidelity, if not in"
10682,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"intelligence. She gives way to her feelings, she recalls the image of"
10683,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Ulysses, whom she nursed, and addresses him as present. She beholds in"
10684,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the stranger the resemblance at the start. ""I have never yet seen any"
10685,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"one so like Ulysses as thou art in body, voice and feet."" We now"
10686,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"observe that Ulysses really selects Eurycleia, ""a certain old woman,"
10687,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"discreet, who has endured as much as I have: she may touch my feet"""
10688,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"(line 346). He sought for some confidant among the servants, one who"
10689,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,might be needed for important duties before and during the fight;
10690,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Eurycleia is chosen, since Ulysses knew that she would discover the"
10691,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"scar on his foot and thus recognize him. All of which takes place,"
10692,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Ulysses exacts secrecy, and she replies, giving a hint of her character"
10693,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"as well as the reason why she was chosen: ""Thou knowest my firmness, I"
10694,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"shall hold like the solid rock or iron."""
10695,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10696,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,There is a long narrative pertaining to the manner in which Ulysses
10697,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,received the wound which caused the scar. Much fault has been found
10698,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"with this story for various reasons, but it gives a certain relief as"
10699,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"well as epical fullness to the movement of the Book. It is, however,"
10700,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"one of those passages which may have been interpolated--or may not, and"
10701,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,just there the argument stands. It traces the character of Ulysses back
10702,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"to his grandfather Antolycus, the most cunning of mortals, and also"
10703,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,gives the etymology (fanciful probably) of the name of Ulysses.
10704,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"(Odysseus, the Greek form of Ulysses, is here derived from a Greek word"
10705,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,meaning _to be angry_.)
10706,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10707,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,4. After the bath Ulysses returns to the hearth where Penelope is still
10708,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"sitting. She tells her dream of the eagle which destroyed her geese,"
10709,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"and which then spoke by way of interpretation: ""The geese are the"
10710,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Suitors and I, once the eagle, am now thy husband."" Such is the"
10711,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"deep-lying presentiment of Penelope, indicated by the dream, which"
10712,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,crops out in spite of her declared skepticism. Note that she dreams not
10713,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,only the dream but also dreams its interpretation; surely she is
10714,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,conscious of some hope now.
10715,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10716,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"The legend at the end of the Book, which tells of the two Gates of"
10717,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Dreams, one of ivory and one of horn, has roused much curiosity among"
10718,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"readers about its purport, and has inspired much imitation from later"
10719,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,poets. Through the Gate of Horn (dimly transparent) comes the true
10720,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"dream; through the Gate of Ivory (polished on the outside, but letting"
10721,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,no light through) comes the false dream. Such is the more common
10722,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"explanation, but Eustathius derives the whole story from two puns on"
10723,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Greek words for horn and ivory. At any rate there are the two sorts of
10724,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"dreams, one getting the impress of the future event, the other being"
10725,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,merely subjective.
10726,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10727,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"But Penelope has another suggestion, which is found widely scattered in"
10728,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"folk-lore, the Bending of the Bow. This incident, however, is developed"
10729,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"in a later Book. It is one of her schemes to defer the hated marriage,"
10730,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,after the new hope given by the stranger. She will not yet give up.
10731,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10732,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,_Book Twentieth._ This book is devoted to describing more fully the
10733,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,situation in the house of Ulysses just before the slaying of the
10734,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Suitors. The guilty and the guiltless are indicated anew, with fresh"
10735,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,incidents; especially the fatuity of the Suitors is set forth in a
10736,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,variety of ways. The scene is in the palace.
10737,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10738,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"The Book may be divided into three portions, which deal with (1) the"
10739,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"royal pair, (2) the servants faithful and faithless, (3) the Suitors at"
10740,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,their banquet.
10741,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10742,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"I. Ulysses is lying on the porch, restless, unable to sleep; he sees"
10743,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,the disloyal women of the household come forth to the embraces of the
10744,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Suitors. He commands himself: ""Endure it, heart; thou hast borne worse"
10745,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"than this."" Pallas has at last to come and to answer his two"
10746,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"troublesome thoughts: ""How shall I, being only one, slay the Suitors,"
10747,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"being many?"" And still, that is not the end. ""How shall I escape"
10748,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"afterward, if I succeed?"" Wherein we may note already a hint of the"
10749,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"last Book of the Odyssey. Pallas reproves him, yet gives him assurance."
10750,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"""If fifty bands of men should surround us,"" still we shall win, ""for I"
10751,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"am a God, and I guard thee always in thy labors."" Whereupon Ulysses at"
10752,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,once went to sleep.
10753,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10754,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,The wife Penelope is also having her period of anxiety and of weeping
10755,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"for her husband; she prays to Diana and wishes for death, being awake."
10756,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"But when asleep, her unconscious nature asserts itself: ""This very"
10757,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"night a man like him lay by me, my heart rejoiced, I thought it no"
10758,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"dream."" Such is the contrast between her waking and her sleeping state;"
10759,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"in the one her skepticism, in the other her instinct manifests itself."
10760,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10761,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,II. We now pass to quite a full survey of the servants of the
10762,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,household. Female slaves have to grind the corn to make bread for the
10763,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Suitors; one of these slaves is still at her task, though past"
10764,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"daybreak, she being the weakest of all. Standing at her hand-mill she"
10765,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"utters the ominous word: ""O Zeus, ruler, fulfill this wish for me"
10766,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"wretched: may the present feast of the Suitors be their last, they who"
10767,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"have loosed my limbs with painful toil in grinding their barley meal!"""
10768,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Thus the prayer of the poor overworked slave-woman calls down the
10769,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"vengeance of the Gods, giving the word of friendly omen to the avenger."
10770,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Certainly a most powerful motive; but again we think, how modern it"
10771,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"sounds! Yet ancient too the thought must have been, for here it stands"
10772,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,in Homer truly prophetic of many things.
10773,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10774,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Eurycleia is the controlling power among the handmaids, of whom there"
10775,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"was a large number; ""twenty went to the spring to fetch water, while"
10776,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"others were busy about the house,"" preparing for the coming banquet."
10777,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,The swineherd Eumæus came with three fat porkers; his disloyal
10778,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"counterpart, Melanthius, also appeared with goats for the feast; both"
10779,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,again show their character to Ulysses. The cowherd Philoetius is now
10780,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"introduced, in a full account; he is one of the faithful, has charity"
10781,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"for the beggar, and shows his fidelity in a number of points. The"
10782,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"beggar assures him: ""Ulysses will return, thou shalt see him slaying"
10783,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"those Suitors,"" whereupon Philoetius volunteers his aid."
10784,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10785,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Thus the forces are assembling; the two sides, loyal and disloyal, are"
10786,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"separating more and more, preparatory to the grand struggle. Ulysses in"
10787,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,his disguise has discovered those upon whom he can depend. But the
10788,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"banquet is ready, the Suitors, who have been plotting against the life"
10789,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"of Telemachus, enter; they are divided among themselves, and can show"
10790,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,no concerted action.
10791,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10792,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"III. This banquet is noticeable, inasmuch as Telemachus asserts the"
10793,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,mastery in his own house and defies the Suitors. He honors the beggar
10794,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"as his guest, and gives warning that nobody insult the poor stranger,"
10795,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"""lest there be trouble."" A number of Suitors show their ill feeling;"
10796,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"one of them, named Ktesippus, flings a bullock's foot at Ulysses ""for a"
10797,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"hospitable present,"" at which the latter ""smiled in sardonic fashion,"""
10798,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"but said nothing. Telemachus, however, reproves the agressor with great"
10799,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"spirit, and asserts himself anew against all deeds of violence. One of"
10800,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the more reasonable Suitors, Agelaus, makes a speech, which commends"
10801,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Telemachus but insists upon his ordering his mother ""to marry the man"
10802,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"who is best and who will give most presents."" In reply Telemachus"
10803,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"declares that he does not hinder the choice of his mother, but that he"
10804,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"will not force her to marry. ""That may God never bring about."" (_Theos_"
10805,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,without article.)
10806,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10807,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Now follows a series of miraculous signs, prodigies, mad doings, which"
10808,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"prefigure the coming destruction. Insane laughter of the Suitors, yet"
10809,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"with eyes full of tears, and with hearts full of sorrow: what does it"
10810,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,all forbode? Here comes the seer Theoclymenus with a terrible
10811,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"interpretation uttered in the true Hebrew prophetic style: ""The hall I"
10812,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,see full of ghosts hastening down to Erebus; the sun in Heaven is
10813,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"extinguished, and a dark cloud overspreads the land."" The Suitors"
10814,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"bemock the prophet, who leaves the company with another fateful vision:"
10815,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"""I perceive evil coming upon you, from which not one of you Suitors"
10816,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"shall escape."" More taunts are flung at Telemachus who now says"
10817,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"nothing; he, his father, and his mother, witness the mad banquet, which"
10818,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"is a veritable feast of Belshazzar, and which has also its prophet. The"
10819,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Hebrew analogy is striking.
10820,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10821,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,_Book Twenty-first._ The test presented in many a tale is here
10822,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,introduced at the turning-point of destiny. The Bending of the Bow and
10823,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,skill in the use thereof are incidents in the folk-lore of every
10824,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"people. The theme is naturally derived from a social condition, in"
10825,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"which the bow and arrow are the chief weapons of defense and offense,"
10826,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"employed against human foes and wild animals. Hence the strong man, the"
10827,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Hero, is the one able to bend the strong bow and to use it with"
10828,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,dexterity. Such a man uses the chief implement of his time and people
10829,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"with the greatest success, hence he is the greatest man. So we have the"
10830,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"test of bending the bow, which simply selects the best man for the time"
10831,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,and circumstances.
10832,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10833,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"In recent interpretations of mythology, this employment of the bow and"
10834,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,arrows has been connected with the sun and its rays. Ulysses is
10835,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"declared to be really a sun-god, a form of Apollo, deity of archery; he"
10836,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"shoots his arrows which are sunbeams and destroys the Suitors, who are"
10837,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the clouds obstructing his light, and wooing his spouse, the day or the"
10838,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,sky. It is also noteworthy that on this very day of the slaughter of
10839,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the Suitors, there is a festival in Ithaca to Apollo, god of light and"
10840,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,archery. This is usually regarded as the New Moon (_Neomenios_)
10841,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,festival. Antinous refers to it (l. 259) and proposes to defer the
10842,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,contest on that account. But Ulysses is made to shoot on the festal day
10843,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,of the sungod.
10844,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10845,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"There is no doubt that mythology is closely connected with Nature, out"
10846,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,of which it develops. In the Vedic hymns we see this connection in the
10847,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"most explicit manner, and threads of the old Aryan Mythus can often be"
10848,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,picked out in Homer. Still we must recollect that it was the archer man
10849,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"who first projected the archer god out of himself, and it is no"
10850,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,explanation of Ulysses to say that he represents the sun-god; rather
10851,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the sun-god represents him. Moreover, the ethical purpose of Ulysses in"
10852,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"slaying the Suitors is the soul of the poem, which is to find its"
10853,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,adequate interpretation in that purpose and in that alone. The incident
10854,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,of Bending the Bow is wrought into a grand scheme of indicating the
10855,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,ethical order of the world.
10856,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10857,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"The three divisions of the Book we shall briefly note, observing how"
10858,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the bow rejects the unfit, and selects the right man."
10859,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10860,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"I. It is Pallas (not Apollo, the archer) who started in the mind of"
10861,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Penelope this scheme of testing the Suitors. Why a Goddess here? It is
10862,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"first a chance thought of the woman, but then it becomes an important"
10863,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"link in the movement of divine nemesis; hence the poet, according to"
10864,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"this custom, traces the inspiration of the idea to a deity. The history"
10865,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,of the famous bow is given with an especial delight in details.
10866,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Penelope herself goes to the room where the armor of the house was
10867,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"kept, gets the bow, and announces the contest to the Suitors."
10868,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10869,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,The man who can bend the bow and send the arrow through the twelve
10870,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"rings, is to bear her away as his bride. The trial is made, no Suitor"
10871,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,is able to bend the weapon. Interesting is the prophet among the
10872,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Suitors, Leiodes, who tries his hand, yet gives the warning: ""This bow"
10873,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"upon this spot will take from many a prince the breath of life."" He"
10874,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"foresees and forewarns, but still acts the transgressor; he prophesies"
10875,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"death to the Suitors, but remains himself a Suitor, and so perishes in"
10876,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,accord with his own prophecy.
10877,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10878,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"II. Ulysses, going to one side with the cowherd and swineherd"
10879,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"(Philoetius and Eumæus), whose loyalty has been so conspicuous, now"
10880,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"discloses himself to them, and assigns their duties in the approaching"
10881,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"conflict. ""I know that you alone of the servants (men) have desired my"
10882,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"return."" He will give them wife and property if he conquers the"
10883,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Suitors, ""and to me ye shall be as companions and brothers of"
10884,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Telemachus."" Deserving to be adopted into the royal house of Ulysses"
10885,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"they both are, being of this little army of four against more than a"
10886,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"hundred enemies. Eumæus is to put the bow into the hands of Ulysses,"
10887,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,after the Suitors have tried the test; Philoetius is to fasten the
10888,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,gates that none escape.
10889,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10890,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,III. After the Suitors have failed to bend the bow and a delay is
10891,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"proposed, Ulysses, the beggar, comes forward and asks to make the"
10892,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"trial. Violent opposition rises on part of the Suitors, but Penelope in"
10893,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,two speeches insists that he shall try. Here again we must ascribe to
10894,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,her unconscious nature some strong affinity with the ragged man before
10895,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"her. She praises the form of the stranger and notes his noble birth,"
10896,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,though she denies the possibility of herself becoming his bride. Still
10897,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"she shows a deep attraction for him, which she cannot suppress."
10898,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10899,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Telemachus now takes the matter in hand, orders his mother out of the"
10900,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"way somewhat abruptly (since the fight is soon to start), and bids the"
10901,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,bow to be carried to Ulysses in face of the outcries of the Suitors.
10902,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Eurycleia, the nurse, is commanded to fasten the doors of the house;"
10903,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,now we see why Ulysses let her recognize him by the scar. Meanwhile
10904,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Philoetius fastens the gates of the court. Apparently there is no
10905,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,escape for the Suitors; Ulysses has the bow; he has tested its quality
10906,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,and possesses a quiver full of arrows.
10907,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10908,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Such is the famous deed of Bending the Bow, which is a symbolic act"
10909,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,pointing out and selecting the Hero. Ulysses is revealed by it to the
10910,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Suitors even before he calls out his name and throws off his disguise;
10911,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"he performs the test, he shoots through the rings without missing, he"
10912,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,has strength and skill for the emergency. If hitherto stress has been
10913,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"laid upon his mind and cunning, now his athletic side is brought to the"
10914,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,front. But it required all his intelligence to reach the point at which
10915,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,his will is to act.
10916,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10917,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,We have now gone through what may be called the first stage of this
10918,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,final part of the Odyssey. The Suitors have fully shown their
10919,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"destructive spirit, disregarding property, family, state, the Gods."
10920,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Ulysses has seen and felt in person their wrongs; their negative career
10921,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"has reached its last deed, he has the bow in his hands and is ready for"
10922,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,the work of retribution. Such is the general sweep of the last five
10923,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Books; but now the destructive deeds of the Suitors are to meet with a
10924,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,still mightier destruction.
10925,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10926,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"_Book Twenty-second._ The final act of justice, the Day of Judgment,"
10927,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,perchance the Crack of Doom; such conceptions have long been familiar
10928,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,to man and still are; in the present Book they find one of their most
10929,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"striking embodiments. That for which so long preparation has been made,"
10930,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,is now realized: the vindication of the Ethical Order of the World.
10931,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"There is, however, little feeling for that charity and humanity before"
10932,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"noticed; stern, inflexible, merciless justice is the mood and meaning"
10933,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,of this piece of writing.
10934,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10935,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,The Book has essentially two parts: the punishment of the guilty men
10936,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"(Suitors and Servants) with the sparing of the innocent, and the"
10937,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,punishment of the guilty women (servants) with the sparing of the
10938,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"innocent. Thus in both parts there is the penalty, yet also the"
10939,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"discrimination, according to the deed."
10940,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10941,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"I. The first part is mainly a battle, an Homeric battle, and reminds"
10942,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,the reader of many a combat in the Iliad. Of the conflict with the
10943,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Suitors here described we can discern three stages, which are marked"
10944,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"also by the use of different weapons, the bow, the spear, and the"
10945,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,sword.
10946,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10947,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"(1) The first stage of the battle opens with the slaying of Antinous,"
10948,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the ringleader of the band, who is pierced by an arrow from the bow of"
10949,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Ulysses. The crowd threatens Ulysses, who now utters to them what may"
10950,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"be called their last judgment, announcing who he is, and his purpose to"
10951,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"punish their crimes: ""Dogs! you thought I would not come back from"
10952,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Troy, and therefore you devoured my substance, debauched my"
10953,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,maid-servants; and wooed my wife while I was still alive. You feared
10954,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"not the Gods, nor the vengeance of man afterwards; now destruction"
10955,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"hangs over you all."" This may be taken as a statement of the ethical"
10956,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,content of the poem from the mouth of Ulysses himself at the critical
10957,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"moment. The Suitors feared not the Gods, were violators of the Divine"
10958,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Order, for which violation man was to punish them. Again the two sides,"
10959,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the divine and human, are put together. In vain Eurymachus, a spokesman"
10960,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"for the Suitors, offers amends, guilt cannot now buy itself free when"
10961,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"caught. Ulysses answers: ""If thou shouldst offer all that thou hast and"
10962,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"all that thy father has, and other gifts, I would not desist."" So"
10963,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Eurymachus, perishes by the second arrow and still another Suitor,"
10964,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Amphinomus is pierced by the spear of Telemachus. Thus three leaders
10965,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,are slain in this preliminary stage.
10966,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10967,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,(2) The second stage of the conflict begins by Telemachus bringing a
10968,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"shield, two spears, and a helmet for his father, whose arrows are not"
10969,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,enough for the enemies. Also he brings armor for the cowherd and
10970,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"swineherd, as well as for himself; thus the four men get themselves"
10971,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,fully equipped.
10972,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10973,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"But in order to make a fair fight, it is necessary that the Suitors be"
10974,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"armed, in part at least. Melanthius, the goatherd, finds his way to the"
10975,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"chamber where the arms are deposited. Arms for twelve he brings, and"
10976,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"then goes for more, when he is caught. But now Pallas has to appear in"
10977,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the form of Mentor, in order to put courage into the heart of Ulysses."
10978,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,The first armed set of Suitors advance and throw their javelins without
10979,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"effect, while the four on the side of Ulysses kill four men. Four more"
10980,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Suitors are slain in a fresh onset, then two more; now their store of"
10981,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,weapons is exhausted. Thirteen mentioned here by name have fallen
10982,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,beside those unnamed ones whom the arrows of Ulysses slew. The most
10983,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"prominent Suitors are weltering in their blood, there are no more"
10984,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"weapons, the result is a panic."
10985,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
10986,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,(3) This is the third stage of the battle. A large majority of the
10987,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Suitors, probably 80 or more out of the 108 plus 10 attendants are"
10988,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"still alive, though without weapons and completely paralyzed with"
10989,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"terror. ""Pallas held from the roof her man-destroying ægis, their"
10990,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"hearts trembled with fear, they fled through the palace like a drove of"
10991,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"cattle."" The four men now use their swords upon the terrified,"
10992,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"defenseless crowd, and cut them down. Leiodes, the soothsayer of the"
10993,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Suitors, begs for mercy and recounts his attempts to restrain their"
10994,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"violent deeds; vain is his prayer, he perishes with his company of"
10995,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"brigands, ""for if thou wert their soothsayer, thou must often in my"
10996,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"palace have prayed the Gods against my return"" and for the Suitors."
10997,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Thus the priestly man too is involved in the net, he knew the wrong,"
10998,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,yet remained the chaplain of that godless company.
10999,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11000,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Two, however, are saved, the guiltless. The bard, who ""sings for Gods"
11001,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"and men"" is spared, because he sang ""by necessity for the Suitors, and"
11002,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"not for sake of gain;"" also Telemachus intercedes for the herald Medon,"
11003,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"who ""took care of me as a child,"" a beautiful gleam on this ghastly"
11004,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"scene. From Ulysses, however, we hear the moral of the event"
11005,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"proclaimed, which the reader may take unto himself: ""From this thou"
11006,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,mayst know and tell to another how much better well-doing is than
11007,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"evil-doing."" So speaks the slayer over these corpses, which utterance"
11008,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,we may at least regard as an attempt of the poet once more to enforce
11009,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,the ethical purpose of his work. Not a single living Suitor or
11010,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"attendant can be found skulking anywhere, and none have escaped."
11011,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11012,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"II. Having completed his task in regard to the guilty men, Ulysses now"
11013,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,turns his attention toward the guilty women of his household. For this
11014,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"purpose Eurycleia is called, and is brought to him; when she sees the"
11015,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"deadly work, she shouts for joy. Ulysses restrains her: ""It is an"
11016,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"unholy thing to exult over the slain."" Here again the ethical nature of"
11017,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"this act is emphasized: ""The decree of the Gods and their own evil"
11018,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"deeds overwhelmed these men; they paid respect to no human being, high"
11019,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"or low, who approached them."" Yet there are modern writers who can see"
11020,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,no ethical purpose in the Odyssey.
11021,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11022,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Eurycleia gives her report: out of fifty serving maids in the palace,"
11023,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"""twelve have mounted the car of shamelessness."" These latter are now"
11024,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"called, are compelled to carry out the dead (among whom are their"
11025,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"lovers), and to make clean the place of slaughter. Then they are led"
11026,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,out and hung: such was the ancient fate of the prostitute in the
11027,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,household.
11028,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11029,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,A still harsher and more ignoble punishment awaits the goatherd
11030,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Melanthius, a cruel mutilation is inflicted upon him, horrible to the"
11031,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"last degree, but it grades his punishment according to his offense. A"
11032,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"fumigation with sulphur we find here, as old as Homer. Then all the"
11033,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"rest of the handmaids are summoned along with Penelope, to witness the"
11034,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,deed and to see the hero.
11035,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11036,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Such is this terrible Book in which destruction is fully meted out to
11037,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"destroyers. According to our count 129 people are here dead, all of"
11038,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"them guilty. A doomsday spectacle for that household, and for all"
11039,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,readers and hearers since; it shows the return of the deed negatively
11040,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"upon the negative doer. But Ulysses, the hero sitting amid these"
11041,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"corpses, is simply the Destroyer, the very picture and embodiment"
11042,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,thereof. Is there to be no positive result of such bloody work? Yes;
11043,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,that is the next thing to be shown forth in the two following Books;
11044,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Ulysses is also the restorer, wherewith his career and this poem will"
11045,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,terminate.
11046,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11047,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,_Book Twenty-third._ The essential fact of this Book is the reunion of
11048,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,husband and wife after twenty years separation. The eternal nature of
11049,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,the bond of the Family is thus asserted as strongly as is possible in
11050,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,the world of Time. This is the deep institutional foundation upon which
11051,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the Odyssey reposes. Still the wife also has to be conquered, that is,"
11052,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,she has to be convinced that the beggar is her husband. All along we
11053,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,have seen the struggle between her instinct and her intellect; her
11054,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"understanding persists in thinking that Ulysses will not come back, yet"
11055,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"she dreams of his restoration, and she feels a strange sympathy with"
11056,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,the old man in rags. Thus the two opposing elements of female nature
11057,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,have been in a conflict with each other; her instinct tries to surge
11058,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"over her intellect, but does not succeed; she demands the complete test"
11059,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"of identity and gets it in the present Book. The old nurse, her son,"
11060,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,and finally Ulysses himself become impatient with her delay and her
11061,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"circumspection, still she holds out against them all, though she has,"
11062,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"too, her own inner emotions to combat. The gradual unfolding of this"
11063,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,scene to the point of recognition must be pronounced a masterpiece of
11064,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,character evolution.
11065,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11066,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,The book may be divided into two portions--before and after the
11067,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Recognition, which culminates when Penelope accepts the test of the"
11068,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,secret bed which was once made by Ulysses.
11069,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11070,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,I. The movement up to the Recognition shows Penelope undergoing a
11071,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"double pressure, from without and from within. Yet it shows too a"
11072,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,corresponding double resistance on her part. First Eurycleia goes to
11073,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"her chamber, and tells her in great glee that the Suitors are slain and"
11074,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"her husband has returned. She can accept the slaughter of the Suitors,"
11075,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"that could have been done by some God, angry at their injustice; but"
11076,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,she will not believe that Ulysses is really in the palace. The nurse
11077,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"cries out: ""Truly thou hast ever had a disbelieving mind,"" and then"
11078,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"tells of the scar. Still incredulous; but she goes down to the court,"
11079,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"and there sees Ulysses in his rags. No sufficient proof yet, though she"
11080,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,has a strange inner struggle not to run up to him that she might clasp
11081,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"his hands and kiss him. But her understanding conquers, she keeps at a"
11082,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"distance, scrutinizing, till Telemachus, impulsive youth, breaks out"
11083,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"into a reproach: ""Mother, thy heart is harder than a rock."" But Ulysses"
11084,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"himself speaks to his son: ""Suffer that thy mother test me;"" she is"
11085,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"like himself, he understands her better than the son does. Finally"
11086,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Ulysses takes the bath and puts on fresh garments, while Pallas gives"
11087,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"him fresh grace and majesty, and increased stature; he comes before"
11088,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Penelope again; still no yielding. Ulysses himself is now forced to
11089,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"exclaim: ""Above all women the Gods have given thee a heart"
11090,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"impenetrable."" Thus the nurse, the son, the husband in turn have failed"
11091,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"to shake her firmness, she must have an absolute test, which is ""known"
11092,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"to him and me, and to us alone."""
11093,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11094,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"This is that strange bed, which Ulysses is unconsciously provoked by"
11095,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"his wife to describe. Penelope commands the nurse: ""Bring the bed out"
11096,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"of the chamber which he made."" But really it could not be removed, it"
11097,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,was constructed of the trunk of an olive tree rooted in the soil and
11098,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,its construction was the secret of himself and wife. Very strong is the
11099,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"symbolism of this bed, and is manifestly intended by the poet. It"
11100,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,typified the firm immovable bond of marriage between the two; their
11101,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"unity could not be broken. Mark the words of Ulysses: ""Woman, thou hast"
11102,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"spoken a painful word,"" when she commanded the bed to be removed; ""who"
11103,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"hath displaced my bed?"" In it there was built ""a great sign"" or"
11104,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"mystery; ""now I do not know if my bed be firm in position, or whether"
11105,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"some other man has moved it elsewhere, cutting the trunk of the olive"
11106,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"tree up by the roots."" Such is his intense feeling about that marriage"
11107,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"bed, deeply symbolic, truly ""a sign,"" as here designated."
11108,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11109,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Now this is just the test which Penelope wanted, a double test indeed,"
11110,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"not only of the head, but also of the heart. He reveals to her not"
11111,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"merely that he knows about the bed, but how strongly he feels in"
11112,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"reference to it, and to what it signifies. For he might be the returned"
11113,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Ulysses, and yet not be hers. But now she has yielded, she explains the"
11114,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"reason of her hesitation, defends herself by the example of Helen who"
11115,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,was cozened by a stranger. She used her craft to defend the unity and
11116,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"sacredness of the Family, against Suitors and even against husband."
11117,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"After some talk, the servant lights them to their chamber, ""they in"
11118,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"great joy take their customary place in their ancient bed."""
11119,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11120,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,II. With the line just quoted (296 of the original) the Alexandrian
11121,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"grammarians, Aristarchus and Aristophanes, concluded the Odyssey, and"
11122,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"declared the rest to be a post-Homeric addition. Still, this part of"
11123,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,the poem must have been in existence and accepted as Homer's long
11124,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,before their time. Both Aristotle and Plato cite portions of it without
11125,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,any declared suspicion of its genuineness. What reason the old
11126,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,grammarians had for this huge excision is not definitely known; we can
11127,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"see, however, that they wished to end the poem with complete"
11128,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"restoration, outer and inner, of the domestic bond between husband and"
11129,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"wife. Certainly a very noble thought in the poem, but by no means a"
11130,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"sufficient end; beside the domestic, the political bond also must be"
11131,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"restored, and the ethical harmony be made complete both in Family and"
11132,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"in State. Ulysses, moreover, has spoken of the duty laid upon him by"
11133,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Tiresias in Hades: he must carry an oar till he comes to a land whose
11134,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,people take it for a winnowing fan; there he is to plant it upright and
11135,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"make an offering to Neptune. So there is a good deal yet to be done,"
11136,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,which the poem has already called for.
11137,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11138,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"But just now she tells him her story, quite briefly; then he tells her"
11139,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"his story, more at length. This has the nature of a confession, with"
11140,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"its Circe and epecially Calypso, which she has to hear and he to make."
11141,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Through it all runs his yearning to reach home and wife.
11142,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11143,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"But with the sun risen, new duties press upon him. First he will seek"
11144,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"some compensation for his property taken by the Suitors; secondly, he"
11145,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,will have to meet the vengeance of their relatives and friends. So the
11146,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"army of four, himself, Telemachus, swineherd and cowherd, march forth"
11147,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"in arms from the palace gate, through the city to the country."
11148,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11149,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,_Book Twenty-fourth._ This is another Book over which there has been
11150,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"much critical discussion. Its thought, whatever may be said about its"
11151,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"execution, is absolutely necessary to bring the Odyssey to an organic"
11152,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"conclusion, and make the poem a well-rounded totality. There is the"
11153,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"political trouble generally, and specially the blood feud caused by the"
11154,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"slaying of the Suitors, which has to be harmonized. Repeatedly hitherto"
11155,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"we have had hints of this coming difficulty; Ulysses thought of it, and"
11156,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,made his plan concerning it before the slaughter took place. (XX. 41.)
11157,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11158,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,In fact the complete restoration of Ulysses is both to Family and
11159,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"State, the two great institutions which form the substructure of the"
11160,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Odyssey. His country was quite as deeply distracted and perverted as
11161,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,his household; both had to undergo the process of purification. In Book
11162,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Twenty-third we had the restoration of Ulysses to Family, in Book"
11163,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Twenty-fourth we are to have essentially his restoration to State; then
11164,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"he will truly have returned to prudent Penelope and to sunny Ithaca,"
11165,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,and the poem can end. Moreover his restoration _to_ Family and State
11166,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,involves the restoration of Family and State; the rightful husband and
11167,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,the rightful ruler heals the shattered institutions.
11168,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11169,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,But it is undeniable that this Book is the most poorly constructed of
11170,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"any Book in the Odyssey. There is undue repetition of previous matters,"
11171,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,yet certainly with important additions; there is unnecessary expansion
11172,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"in the earlier parts of the Book, and too great compression and hurry"
11173,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"at the end. In general, the subject-matter of the Book is completely"
11174,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"valid and necessary to the poem, but the execution falls below the"
11175,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Homeric level, specially in its constructive feature. Still we see ino"
11176,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,reason why it may not be Homer's; he too has his best and worst Books.
11177,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11178,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Of the present Book there are two parts: the Underworld and the
11179,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Upperworld.
11180,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11181,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,I. The Suitors have been sent down to the realm where Ulysses in the
11182,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Eleventh Book found the souls of the Trojan Heroes, Agamemnon,"
11183,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Achilles, Ajax. These three again are introduced with some others. The"
11184,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"death of Achilles is described quite fully, when the souls of the"
11185,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Suitors arrive, and one of them, Amphimedon, recapitulates the story of"
11186,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the Odyssey. It tells of the craft and fidelity of Penelope, and of the"
11187,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,return of Ulysses and his destruction of the Suitors. The words of
11188,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Agamemnon recognize the pair, Ulysses and Penelope, as the supreme"
11189,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Greek man and woman, as those who have mastered the greatest"
11190,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"difficulties of their epoch. The Trojan cycle is now complete, the"
11191,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"separation caused by the war is bridged over, both Family and State are"
11192,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,restored after the long disruption. In striking contrast was the case
11193,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"of Agamemnon and Clytæmnestra, both of whom perished without"
11194,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"restoration. Thus by means of the ghosts of the Suitors, the famous"
11195,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,careers of Ulysses and Penelope are taken up into the realm of the
11196,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Supersensible, of ideal forms, whose fame is to last forever."
11197,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11198,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,This part of the Book (the so-called second Nekyia) in which Hades
11199,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"appears the second time, has been sharply questioned both by ancient"
11200,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"and modern critics on a number of grounds. These we shall not discuss,"
11201,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,only stating that they are by no means conclusive against the
11202,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,genuineness of the whole passage. The general idea of it belongs here;
11203,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the dead Suitors represent the grand end of the Trojan movement, and"
11204,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"its reception into the Hades of famous deeds done and past, and very"
11205,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"significantly Agamemnon voices the praise of Ulysses and Penelope, the"
11206,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,great winners in the long struggle. Still the repetitions of previous
11207,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"portions of the Odyssey are to our mind unnecessary and prolix, though"
11208,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,the literary skill manifested just herein has been highly lauded by
11209,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Saint Beuve and Lang.
11210,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11211,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,II. Coming back to the Upperworld we find a series of incidents
11212,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,following one another both slowly and hurriedly. These we shall throw
11213,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,in groups for the sake of a rapid survey.
11214,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11215,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,1. Ulysses with his three companions comes to the country seat of his
11216,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"father Laertes. With him, too, he plays the same disguise as heretofore"
11217,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"with Penelope, Eumæus and others, though its necessity is not now so"
11218,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"plain. ""I shall test my father, to see if he will know me;"" how fond"
11219,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Ulysses is of this! So we have more fictions, masquerading, and final"
11220,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"recognition by the scar and other proofs. Also an old servant here,"
11221,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Dolius, is recognized."
11222,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11223,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,2. Now the scene passes to the city. The friends of the Suitors have
11224,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"called an assembly; a strong party rises in opposition to Ulysses,"
11225,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"though two men, Medon and Halitherses, speak on his side. The result"
11226,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"is, a band under Eupeithes, father of Antinous, marches forth to wreak"
11227,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,vengeance upon Ulysses.
11228,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11229,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,3. Hereupon a divine interference. Zeus decrees that there must be no
11230,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"blood-feud between the relatives of the slain and the House of Ulysses,"
11231,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,but a league of friendship. Revenge must no longer beget revenge.
11232,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11233,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"4. Still a fight occurs in which Laertes and Dolius with his six sons,"
11234,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"take part. Old Laertes is now to have his warlike meed, be kills old"
11235,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Eupeithes, so that the male members of the House of Ulysses for three"
11236,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"generations--son, grandson, grandfather--have each killed his man."
11237,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11238,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"5. Pallas hereupon stops the conflict, and the last lines of the poem"
11239,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,announce the peace which she makes under the form and voice of Mentor.
11240,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,Surely the work of wisdom (Pallas) as well as of supreme law (Zeus)--to
11241,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,stop the self-repeating blood-feud. Thus is the deep rent in the State
11242,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,healed by aid of Zeus and Pallas. It should be observed that Pallas at
11243,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the end of the _Eumenides_ of the poet Æschylus released Orestes, who"
11244,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"is pursued by the Furies, from the guilt of his mother's blood, by"
11245,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,casting the decisive ballot in the court of Areiopagus. Here we find
11246,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,another link between Homer and Æschylus.
11247,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11248,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Very hurried are these later incidents of the Book, but they are"
11249,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"necessary to complete the poem. The blood-feud is harmonized, the Gods"
11250,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,again make themselves valid in the land by introducing peace and
11251,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"harmony, which had been undermined by the Suitors. Property, Family,"
11252,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"State, are restored, and the Divine Order of the World in the person of"
11253,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,the Gods is recognized. Only with this conclusion is the negative
11254,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"conduct of the Suitors completely undone, and a positive institutional"
11255,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,life becomes possible. It is true that in the hurry of coming to an
11256,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"end, the poet says nothing of the journey enjoined by Tiresias in"
11257,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"Hades, the journey to a distant people who would take an oar for a"
11258,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"winnowing fan. Still we may suppose that it was performed, and that"
11259,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"angry Neptune, the great enemy of Ulysses among the Gods, was also"
11260,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"reconciled. But, chiefly, Ulysses has above on this earth realized the"
11261,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"idea of a world-justice, which we found running through all Hades, in"
11262,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"the statements of Tiresias, in the fates of the great Greek heroes, in"
11263,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,the punitory portion presided over by Minos. From this point of view
11264,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,the Odyssey may be truly regarded an image of the working of the Spirit
11265,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,"of History, and the poem holds good for all time."
11266,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11267,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11268,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11269,_BOOKS XVII-XXIV._,
11270,_SUMMARY._,_SUMMARY._
11271,_SUMMARY._,
11272,_SUMMARY._,
11273,_SUMMARY._,"In concluding these lengthy studies of the Iliad and the Odyssey, we"
11274,_SUMMARY._,"shall try to grasp each of the poems as a whole, and then the two"
11275,_SUMMARY._,together is one great totality sprung of one people and of one
11276,_SUMMARY._,"consciousness. The central fact out of which both poems arise, to which"
11277,_SUMMARY._,"and from which both poems move, is the Trojan War. This War, whether"
11278,_SUMMARY._,"mythical or historical, is certainly the most famous, and probably the"
11279,_SUMMARY._,most significant that ever took place on the earth.
11280,_SUMMARY._,
11281,_SUMMARY._,"As to the Odyssey, the first thing to be seized is the complete career"
11282,_SUMMARY._,of its Hero Ulysses. This career has naturally two parts: the going to
11283,_SUMMARY._,"Troy from Ithaca, and the coming back from Troy to Ithaca. Every Greek"
11284,_SUMMARY._,"hero had a similar career, wholly or in part; many, of coarse, never"
11285,_SUMMARY._,returned. The two parts together constitute a total movement which
11286,_SUMMARY._,begins at a certain point and returns to the same; hence it may be
11287,_SUMMARY._,"called a cycle, and its two parts may be designated in a general way as"
11288,_SUMMARY._,the Separation and the Return.
11289,_SUMMARY._,
11290,_SUMMARY._,"The Odyssey has as its theme the second half of the cycle, though, of"
11291,_SUMMARY._,"course, it presupposes the first half, namely the going to Troy and the"
11292,_SUMMARY._,"stay there. The poem, accordingly, does not give the entire life of"
11293,_SUMMARY._,Ulysses; what may be called the Trojan half must be looked for
11294,_SUMMARY._,"elsewhere, mainly in the Iliad. Of course there are in the Odyssey many"
11295,_SUMMARY._,allusions to incidents which belong to the first half of this career.
11296,_SUMMARY._,
11297,_SUMMARY._,The Ulysses of the Iliad is one of the great leaders and one of the
11298,_SUMMARY._,"great heroes, but he is neither the chief leader nor the chief hero."
11299,_SUMMARY._,"Already he appears in Book First as a member of the Council, and an"
11300,_SUMMARY._,epithet is applied to him which suggests his wisdom. Thus at the start
11301,_SUMMARY._,"of the Iliad he is designated as the man of thought, of intelligence,"
11302,_SUMMARY._,"of many resources. But in the Second Book he shines with full glory, he"
11303,_SUMMARY._,is indeed the pivot of the whole Book. On account of a speech made by
11304,_SUMMARY._,"Agamemnon, their leader, the Greeks start at once for home, they are"
11305,_SUMMARY._,"ready to give up the great enterprise of the restoration of Helen, they"
11306,_SUMMARY._,act as if they would abandon their cause. It is Ulysses who calls them
11307,_SUMMARY._,back to themselves and restores order; he shows himself to be the only
11308,_SUMMARY._,man in the whole army who knows what to do in a critical emergency. He
11309,_SUMMARY._,"suppresses Thersites, he exhorts the chieftains, he uses force on the"
11310,_SUMMARY._,common people. He finally makes a speech to the entire body of Greeks
11311,_SUMMARY._,"in the Assembly, which recalls the great national purpose of the War,"
11312,_SUMMARY._,and is the true word for the time. Nestor follows him in a similar
11313,_SUMMARY._,"vein, and the Greek host again takes its place in line of battle and"
11314,_SUMMARY._,prepares for the onset upon Troy. Here we have a typical action of
11315,_SUMMARY._,"Ulysses, showing his essential character, and revealing the germ out of"
11316,_SUMMARY._,which the Odyssey may well have sprouted.
11317,_SUMMARY._,
11318,_SUMMARY._,"Other matters may also be noticed. Pallas, the Goddess of Wisdom,"
11319,_SUMMARY._,"appears to him in the midst of the tumult, and gives him her"
11320,_SUMMARY._,"suggestion. She will remain with him ever afterwards, manifesting"
11321,_SUMMARY._,herself to him in like emergencies till the end of the Odyssey.
11322,_SUMMARY._,Telemachus is mentioned in this Book of the Iliad. The distinction
11323,_SUMMARY._,between Ulysses and the aged Nestor is drawn: the latter has
11324,_SUMMARY._,"appreciative wisdom, that of experience, while Ulysses has creative"
11325,_SUMMARY._,"wisdom, that of immediate divine insight, coming directly from Pallas."
11326,_SUMMARY._,This distinction also will show itself in the Odyssey. Ulysses is the
11327,_SUMMARY._,real hero of the Second Book of the Iliad; he appears in other Books
11328,_SUMMARY._,"with the same general character, but never so prominently again."
11329,_SUMMARY._,
11330,_SUMMARY._,"In the Post-Iliad, or that portion of the Trojan war which lies between"
11331,_SUMMARY._,"the Iliad and Odyssey, Ulysses will become the chief hero. After the"
11332,_SUMMARY._,"death of Achilles, there will be a contest for the latter's arms"
11333,_SUMMARY._,"between him and Ajax; Ulysses wins. That is, Brain not Brawn is to"
11334,_SUMMARY._,"control henceforth. Under the lead of Intelligence, which is that of"
11335,_SUMMARY._,"Ulysses, Troy falls."
11336,_SUMMARY._,
11337,_SUMMARY._,"The Odyssey, then, deals with the return of Ulysses from the Trojan"
11338,_SUMMARY._,"War, and lasts ten years, as the account runs. But the poet is not"
11339,_SUMMARY._,"writing a history, not even a biography, in the ordinary sense; he does"
11340,_SUMMARY._,"not follow step by step the hero's wanderings, or state the events in"
11341,_SUMMARY._,chronological order; we shall see how the poem turns back upon itself
11342,_SUMMARY._,and begins only some forty days before its close. Still the Odyssey
11343,_SUMMARY._,"will give not merely the entire return from Troy, but will suggest the"
11344,_SUMMARY._,whole cycle of its hero's development.
11345,_SUMMARY._,
11346,_SUMMARY._,"The first half of the cycle, the going to Troy and the stay there,"
11347,_SUMMARY._,"lasted ten years, though some accounts have made it longer. The Iliad,"
11348,_SUMMARY._,"though its action is compressed to a few days, treats generally of the"
11349,_SUMMARY._,first half of the cycle and hence it is the grand presupposition of the
11350,_SUMMARY._,"Odyssey, which takes it for granted everywhere. The Iliad, however, is"
11351,_SUMMARY._,"a unity and has its own center of action, which is the wrath of"
11352,_SUMMARY._,Achilles and his reconciliation also; it is in itself a complete cycle
11353,_SUMMARY._,of individual experience in the Trojan War.
11354,_SUMMARY._,
11355,_SUMMARY._,We now begin to get an outline of the Unity of Homer. In the first
11356,_SUMMARY._,"place the Iliad is a unity from the stand-point of its hero Achilles,"
11357,_SUMMARY._,"who has a completely rounded period of his life portrayed therein,"
11358,_SUMMARY._,"which portrayal, however, gives also a vivid picture of the Trojan War"
11359,_SUMMARY._,"up to date. As an individual experience it is a whole, and this is what"
11360,_SUMMARY._,makes it a poem and gives to it special unity. But it is only a
11361,_SUMMARY._,fragment of the Trojan cycle--a half or less than a half; it leaves
11362,_SUMMARY._,"important problems unsolved: Troy is not taken, Achilles is still"
11363,_SUMMARY._,"alive, the new order under the new hero Ulysses has not yet set in, and"
11364,_SUMMARY._,"chiefly there is no return to Greece, which is even more difficult than"
11365,_SUMMARY._,"the taking of Troy. Hence the field of the second poem, the Odyssey,"
11366,_SUMMARY._,which is also an individual experience--has to be so in order to be a
11367,_SUMMARY._,poem--embraces the rest of the Trojan cycle after the Iliad.
11368,_SUMMARY._,
11369,_SUMMARY._,Thus we may well hold to these unities in Homer: the unity of the
11370,_SUMMARY._,"Iliad, the unity of the Odyssey, and the unity of the Iliad and the"
11371,_SUMMARY._,Odyssey. Both together make one grand cycle of human history and of
11372,_SUMMARY._,human consciousness; they portray a complete world in its deed and in
11373,_SUMMARY._,"its thought, as well as in manners and institutions."
11374,_SUMMARY._,
11375,_SUMMARY._,"Here is, then, the highest point of view from which to look at these"
11376,_SUMMARY._,"poems: they are really one in two parts, written by one epoch, by one"
11377,_SUMMARY._,"consciousness, and probably by one man. The Iliad as a poem is a"
11378,_SUMMARY._,"complete cycle of individual experience, but as an epoch is only half a"
11379,_SUMMARY._,cycle. In like manner the Odyssey as a poem is a complete cycle of
11380,_SUMMARY._,"individual experience, but as an epoch is the second half of the cycle"
11381,_SUMMARY._,of which the Iliad is essentially the first. Both together constitute
11382,_SUMMARY._,the one great movement usually called the Trojan War.
11383,_SUMMARY._,
11384,_SUMMARY._,Much time has been spent in discussing the question whether the Trojan
11385,_SUMMARY._,War was historical or mythical. We make bold to affirm that it was
11386,_SUMMARY._,both--both historical and mythical. It began long before the dawn of
11387,_SUMMARY._,history and it exists to this day. For the Trojan War is the conflict
11388,_SUMMARY._,"between Orient and Occident, starting in the twilight of time, and not"
11389,_SUMMARY._,yet concluded by any means. The conflict between Orient and Occident
11390,_SUMMARY._,"runs through all Greek Mythology, is indeed just the deepest,"
11391,_SUMMARY._,tone-giving element thereof. It also runs through all Greek history
11392,_SUMMARY._,"from the Persian War to the conquests of Alexander, and lurks still in"
11393,_SUMMARY._,the present struggle between Greek and Turk. The true Mythus gives in
11394,_SUMMARY._,an image or event the events of all time; it is an ideal symbol which
11395,_SUMMARY._,is realized in history.
11396,_SUMMARY._,
11397,_SUMMARY._,"We have above said that the Trojan War was a complete cycle, of which"
11398,_SUMMARY._,the two poems portray the two halves. Still further can the matter be
11399,_SUMMARY._,"carried. The Trojan cycle, complete in itself as a phase of Greek"
11400,_SUMMARY._,"consciousness, is but a fragment, a half of a still larger cycle of"
11401,_SUMMARY._,human development. The Iliad and the Odyssey give the Greek half of the
11402,_SUMMARY._,grand world-movement of the Trojan epoch; there is also an Oriental
11403,_SUMMARY._,half which these poems presuppose and from which they separate. Thus
11404,_SUMMARY._,"the grand Homeric cycle, while a unit in itself, is really a separation"
11405,_SUMMARY._,"from the East, a separation which rendered the Occident possible; the"
11406,_SUMMARY._,"woes before Troy were the birth-pangs of the new-born child, Europe,"
11407,_SUMMARY._,now also grown a little old.
11408,_SUMMARY._,
11409,_SUMMARY._,"The reader naturally asks, will there be any return to the Orient after"
11410,_SUMMARY._,"the grand Greek separation, first heralded on the plains of Ilium? It"
11411,_SUMMARY._,may be answered that Europe has often returned to the East in the
11412,_SUMMARY._,"course of history--Alexander, Rome, the Crusades; at present, western"
11413,_SUMMARY._,Europe seems bent on getting to the far East. But the true return of
11414,_SUMMARY._,"the Occident to the Orient will be round the globe, by way of America,"
11415,_SUMMARY._,and that will be complete. The recent war between Japan and China is
11416,_SUMMARY._,really a stage of the great new epoch in the world-historical return to
11417,_SUMMARY._,the Orient.
11418,_SUMMARY._,
11419,_SUMMARY._,"Such is the more external, the historical phase of the Iliad and"
11420,_SUMMARY._,"Odyssey. But they have also a deep internal ethical phase, they show"
11421,_SUMMARY._,two sides of one grand process of the human soul which has been called
11422,_SUMMARY._,"self-alienation, the sacrifice of the immediate self in order to gain"
11423,_SUMMARY._,"true self-hood. The Greeks had to immolate their dearest ties, those of"
11424,_SUMMARY._,"home and country, in order to preserve home and country, which had been"
11425,_SUMMARY._,assailed to the very heart by the rape of Helen. They had to educate
11426,_SUMMARY._,"themselves to a life of violence, killing men, women, even children,"
11427,_SUMMARY._,"destroying home and country. For Troy also has Family and State, though"
11428,_SUMMARY._,it be a complete contradiction of Family and State by supporting Paris.
11429,_SUMMARY._,"But when the Greeks had taken Troy, they were trained destroyers of"
11430,_SUMMARY._,"home and country, they were destruction organized and victorious, yet"
11431,_SUMMARY._,their whole purpose was to save home and country. Thus their
11432,_SUMMARY._,"self-alienation has deepened into absolute self-contradiction, the"
11433,_SUMMARY._,complete scission of the soul.
11434,_SUMMARY._,
11435,_SUMMARY._,"Now this is the spiritual condition of which they are to get rid, out"
11436,_SUMMARY._,of which they are to return to home and country. As before said it may
11437,_SUMMARY._,"be deemed a harder problem than the taking of Troy, which was simply a"
11438,_SUMMARY._,"negative act, the destroying the destroyers of home and country. But"
11439,_SUMMARY._,"the great positive act of the Trojan heroes is the restoration, not"
11440,_SUMMARY._,"merely the outer but the inner restoration, to home and country."
11441,_SUMMARY._,
11442,_SUMMARY._,"With these considerations before the mind of the reader, he is now"
11443,_SUMMARY._,ready to grasp the full sweep of the Odyssey and understand its
11444,_SUMMARY._,"conflict. It springs from the separation caused by a war, here the"
11445,_SUMMARY._,Trojan War. The man is removed from his institutional life and thrown
11446,_SUMMARY._,into a world of violence and destruction. Let us summarize the leading
11447,_SUMMARY._,points of the process.
11448,_SUMMARY._,
11449,_SUMMARY._,"I. The absence of Ulysses leaves his family without a head, his country"
11450,_SUMMARY._,"without a ruler, and his property without an owner. All these relations"
11451,_SUMMARY._,begin to loosen and go to pieces; destructive forces assail the
11452,_SUMMARY._,"decaying organism; the Suitors appear, who consume his property, woo"
11453,_SUMMARY._,"his queen, and seek to usurp his kingly authority. Such are the"
11454,_SUMMARY._,dissolving energies at work in Ithaca. Also his son Telemachus is left
11455,_SUMMARY._,without paternal training.
11456,_SUMMARY._,
11457,_SUMMARY._,"II. Next let us glance at the individual. Ulysses, released from"
11458,_SUMMARY._,"domestic life and civil order, gives himself up to destroying domestic"
11459,_SUMMARY._,"life and civil order, though they be those of the enemy. For ten years"
11460,_SUMMARY._,"he pays no respect to Property, Family and State in Troy; he is trained"
11461,_SUMMARY._,"into their annihilation, and finally does annihilate them. Yet his"
11462,_SUMMARY._,"object is to restore Helen, to vindicate Family and State, and even"
11463,_SUMMARY._,Property.
11464,_SUMMARY._,
11465,_SUMMARY._,III. Troy is destroyed because it was itself destructive; it assailed
11466,_SUMMARY._,the Greek domestic and civil institutions in the rape of Helen. So the
11467,_SUMMARY._,"destroying city itself is destroyed, but this leaves Ulysses a"
11468,_SUMMARY._,destroyer in deed and in spirit; home and country he is not only
11469,_SUMMARY._,separated from but is destructive of--he is a negative man.
11470,_SUMMARY._,
11471,_SUMMARY._,The previous three paragraphs contain the leading presuppositions of
11472,_SUMMARY._,"the Odyssey, and show the first half of the life of Ulysses. They"
11473,_SUMMARY._,"indicate three phases of the working of the negative--in Ithaca, in"
11474,_SUMMARY._,"Troy, and in Ulysses. But now that Troy is destroyed, how will Ulysses"
11475,_SUMMARY._,"return to institutional life, which he has destroyed in Troy, in"
11476,_SUMMARY._,"himself, and, through his absence, in Ithaca?"
11477,_SUMMARY._,
11478,_SUMMARY._,"IV. The Return must in the first place be within himself, he must get"
11479,_SUMMARY._,rid of the destructive spirit begotten of war. For this purpose he has
11480,_SUMMARY._,the grand training told in his adventures; he must put down the
11481,_SUMMARY._,"monsters of Fableland, Polyphemus, Circe, Charybdis; he must endure the"
11482,_SUMMARY._,long servitude under Calypso; he must see Phæacia. When he is
11483,_SUMMARY._,"internally ready, he can go forth and destroy the Suitors, destroy them"
11484,_SUMMARY._,"without becoming destructive himself, which was his outcome at Troy."
11485,_SUMMARY._,"For the destruction of Troy left him quite as negative as the Suitors,"
11486,_SUMMARY._,of which condition he is to rid himself ere he can rid Ithaca of the
11487,_SUMMARY._,"Suitors. This destruction thus becomes a great positive act, now he"
11488,_SUMMARY._,"restores Family and State, and brings peace and harmony."
11489,_SUMMARY._,
11490,_SUMMARY._,One result of separating from the Family is that the son Telemachus has
11491,_SUMMARY._,not the training given by the father. But the son shows his blood; he
11492,_SUMMARY._,"goes forth and gets his own training, the best of the time. This is"
11493,_SUMMARY._,told in the Telemachiad. Thus he can co-operate with his father.
11494,_SUMMARY._,
11495,_SUMMARY._,_The movement overarching the Odyssey._ The reader will note that in
11496,_SUMMARY._,the preceding account we have tried to unfold the movement of the
11497,_SUMMARY._,"Odyssey as the return from the Trojan War. But as already stated, it is"
11498,_SUMMARY._,"itself but a part of a larger movement, a segment of a great cycle,"
11499,_SUMMARY._,"which cycle again suggests a still greater cycle, which last is the"
11500,_SUMMARY._,"movement of the World's History. Recall, then, that the Odyssey by"
11501,_SUMMARY._,itself is a complete cycle as far as the experience of its hero is
11502,_SUMMARY._,"concerned; but as belonging to an epoch, it is but half of the total"
11503,_SUMMARY._,cycle of the Trojan War. Then again this Trojan War is but a fragment
11504,_SUMMARY._,of a movement which is the total World's History. Now can this be set
11505,_SUMMARY._,forth in a summary which will suggest the movement not of the Odyssey
11506,_SUMMARY._,"alone, but also the movement underlying and overlying the poem? Let us"
11507,_SUMMARY._,"make the trial, for a world-poem must take its place in the World's"
11508,_SUMMARY._,"History, which fact gives the final judgment of its worth."
11509,_SUMMARY._,
11510,_SUMMARY._,"I. In the prehistoric time before Homer, there was an Orient, but no"
11511,_SUMMARY._,Occident; the spiritual day of the latter had not yet dawned. Very
11512,_SUMMARY._,"early began the movement toward separation, which had one of its"
11513,_SUMMARY._,greatest epochs in the Trojan War.
11514,_SUMMARY._,
11515,_SUMMARY._,"1. Greece in those old ages was full of the throes of birth, but was"
11516,_SUMMARY._,"not yet born. It was still essentially Oriental, it had no independent"
11517,_SUMMARY._,"development of its own, though it was moving toward independence. The"
11518,_SUMMARY._,earliest objects dug out of the long buried cities of Greece show an
11519,_SUMMARY._,Oriental connection; the famous sculptured lions over the gate of
11520,_SUMMARY._,Mycenæ last to this day as a reminder of the early Hellenic connection
11521,_SUMMARY._,"of European Greece with the Orient, not to speak of Cyprus, Crete, and"
11522,_SUMMARY._,the lesser islands of the Ægean.
11523,_SUMMARY._,
11524,_SUMMARY._,"2. Then came the great separation of Greece from the Orient, which is"
11525,_SUMMARY._,"the fundamental fact of the Trojan War, and of which the Homeric poems"
11526,_SUMMARY._,"are the mighty announcement to the future. Troy, an Orientalizing"
11527,_SUMMARY._,"Hellenic city in Asia, seizes and keeps Greek Helen, who is of Europe;"
11528,_SUMMARY._,"it tears her away from home and country, and through its deed destroys"
11529,_SUMMARY._,"Family and State. Greek Europe restores her, must restore her, if its"
11530,_SUMMARY._,people be true to their institutional principles; hence their great
11531,_SUMMARY._,"word is restoration, first of their ideal Helen, and secondly of"
11532,_SUMMARY._,themselves.
11533,_SUMMARY._,
11534,_SUMMARY._,"So all the Greeks, in order to make the separation from the Orient and"
11535,_SUMMARY._,"restore Helen, have to march forth to war and thus be separated"
11536,_SUMMARY._,"themselves from home and country, till they bring back Helen to home"
11537,_SUMMARY._,and country. The deed done to Helen strikes every Greek man till he
11538,_SUMMARY._,undoes it. The stages of this movement may be set down separately.
11539,_SUMMARY._,
11540,_SUMMARY._,"(_a_) The leaving home for Troy--Achilles, Agamemnon, Ulysses; all"
11541,_SUMMARY._,the heroes had their special story of departure. Ulysses had to
11542,_SUMMARY._,"quit a young wife, Penelope, and an infant son, Telemachus. For if"
11543,_SUMMARY._,"Helen can be abducted, no Greek family is safe."
11544,_SUMMARY._,
11545,_SUMMARY._,(_b_) Stay at Troy for 10 years. This is also a long training to
11546,_SUMMARY._,"destruction. Ulysses is an important man, but not the hero. Here"
11547,_SUMMARY._,lies the sphere of the Iliad.
11548,_SUMMARY._,
11549,_SUMMARY._,(_c_) Destruction of the city and the restoration of Helen to her
11550,_SUMMARY._,"husband, both of which are not told in the Iliad but are given"
11551,_SUMMARY._,subordinately in the Odyssey. Thus is the separation from the
11552,_SUMMARY._,"Orient completed on its negative side, that is, as far as"
11553,_SUMMARY._,destruction can complete it.
11554,_SUMMARY._,
11555,_SUMMARY._,"3. The return to Greece of the survivors. The question is, How can they"
11556,_SUMMARY._,truly get back after so long a period of violence? The Odyssey has this
11557,_SUMMARY._,"as its theme, and will give an account of all the returns. Here, too,"
11558,_SUMMARY._,we observe various stages.
11559,_SUMMARY._,
11560,_SUMMARY._,(_a_) Leaving Troy for home. This means a complete facing about and
11561,_SUMMARY._,"a going the other way, not only in geography, but also in conduct."
11562,_SUMMARY._,The Greeks must now quit destruction and become constructive.
11563,_SUMMARY._,
11564,_SUMMARY._,(_b_) It is no wonder that the journey home was very difficult.
11565,_SUMMARY._,"Quarrels arose at the start (see Nestor's account Book III., and"
11566,_SUMMARY._,that of Menelaus Book IV.). Many perished on the way; some were
11567,_SUMMARY._,"lost in a storm at sea, Agamemnon was slain on the threshold of his"
11568,_SUMMARY._,own palace.
11569,_SUMMARY._,
11570,_SUMMARY._,"(_c_) Those who reached home, the successful returners, were of"
11571,_SUMMARY._,"three main kinds, represented by Nestor, by Menelaus, and by"
11572,_SUMMARY._,"Ulysses. These were restored to home and family, and brought peace"
11573,_SUMMARY._,"and harmony. Such is the positive outcome of the Trojan War, and"
11574,_SUMMARY._,the completion of its cycle.
11575,_SUMMARY._,
11576,_SUMMARY._,"II. But this rounding-off of the Trojan cycle is, on the other hand, a"
11577,_SUMMARY._,"final separation from the Orient; the scission is now unfolded,"
11578,_SUMMARY._,"explicit, quite conscious. When Ulysses comes back to Ithaca, and"
11579,_SUMMARY._,"re-establishes Family and State, Greek life is independent, distinct,"
11580,_SUMMARY._,self-determined. The Hellenic world rises and fulfills its destiny in
11581,_SUMMARY._,"its own way; it creates the Fine Arts, Literature, Science; it is the"
11582,_SUMMARY._,beginning of the Occident.
11583,_SUMMARY._,
11584,_SUMMARY._,Still the thought must come up that the Orient is also a part of the
11585,_SUMMARY._,"grand movement of the World's History, whose cycle embraces both"
11586,_SUMMARY._,Occident and Orient. The Odyssey has many glimpses of this higher view.
11587,_SUMMARY._,The first 12 books move westward and have their outlook in that
11588,_SUMMARY._,"direction, the last 12 books have their outlook eastward toward Egypt,"
11589,_SUMMARY._,"Phoenicia, and the Oriental borderland. The earlier fairy tales of"
11590,_SUMMARY._,"Ulysses have their scene in the West, while the later romances or"
11591,_SUMMARY._,novelettes interwoven in the last 12 Books have their scene in the
11592,_SUMMARY._,"East, with one exception possibly."
11593,_SUMMARY._,
11594,_SUMMARY._,"The main fact, however, of the Trojan cycle is the great separation,"
11595,_SUMMARY._,"deepest in history, between Orient and Occident, through the"
11596,_SUMMARY._,instrumentality of Greece. The civilization of Europe and the West is
11597,_SUMMARY._,"the offspring of that separation, which is still going on, is a living"
11598,_SUMMARY._,"fact, and is the source of the vexed Eastern question of European"
11599,_SUMMARY._,politics.
11600,_SUMMARY._,
11601,_SUMMARY._,"III. We are living to-day in that separation; our art, science,"
11602,_SUMMARY._,"education, poetic forms, our secular life largely come from ancient"
11603,_SUMMARY._,"Greece. Oriental art, customs, domestic life, government, we do not as"
11604,_SUMMARY._,a rule fraternize with; the Greek diremption is in us still; only in
11605,_SUMMARY._,"one way, in our religious life, do we keep a connection with an"
11606,_SUMMARY._,Oriental people. But is this separation never to be overcome? Is there
11607,_SUMMARY._,to be no return to the East and completion of the world's cycle?
11608,_SUMMARY._,
11609,_SUMMARY._,"_The Cycle._ We have often used this word, and some may think that we"
11610,_SUMMARY._,have abused it; still our object is to restore the Greek conception of
11611,_SUMMARY._,"these poems, as they were looked at and spoken of by Hellas herself."
11612,_SUMMARY._,The idea of the cycle was fundamental in grasping the epics which
11613,_SUMMARY._,"related to the Trojan War, and this War itself was regarded as a cycle"
11614,_SUMMARY._,"of events and deeds, which the poets sang and put into their poetic"
11615,_SUMMARY._,cycle. Let us briefly trace this thought of the cycle as developed in
11616,_SUMMARY._,old Greece.
11617,_SUMMARY._,
11618,_SUMMARY._,"I. In two different passages of his _Organon_, Aristotle calls the epic"
11619,_SUMMARY._,a cycle and the poetry of Homer a cycle. Now both passages are employed
11620,_SUMMARY._,"by him to illustrate a defective syllogism, hence are purely"
11621,_SUMMARY._,incidental. But no instance could better show the prevalence of the
11622,_SUMMARY._,"idea of a cycle as applied to Homer and epic poetry, for the"
11623,_SUMMARY._,philosopher evidently draws his illustration from something familiar to
11624,_SUMMARY._,"everybody. It had become a Greek common-place 350 B.C., and probably"
11625,_SUMMARY._,"long before, that an epic poem, such as the Iliad or Odyssey, is"
11626,_SUMMARY._,"cyclical, and that both together make a cycle."
11627,_SUMMARY._,
11628,_SUMMARY._,"II. But this idea develops, and expands beyond the Iliad and Odyssey,"
11629,_SUMMARY._,which are found to leave out many events of the Trojan Cycle. Indeed
11630,_SUMMARY._,"the myth-making spirit of Greece unfolds new incidents, deeds, and"
11631,_SUMMARY._,"characters. The result is that many poets, after Homer had completed"
11632,_SUMMARY._,"his cycle, began filling the old gaps, or really making new ones that"
11633,_SUMMARY._,these might be filled by a fresh poem. Hence arose the famous Epic
11634,_SUMMARY._,"Cycle, which has been preserved in a kind of summary supposed to have"
11635,_SUMMARY._,"been written by Proclus, not the philosopher, but a grammarian of the"
11636,_SUMMARY._,time of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius.
11637,_SUMMARY._,
11638,_SUMMARY._,"Meantime, let us carefully distinguish some of our Cycles. The Trojan"
11639,_SUMMARY._,"Cycle is one of events and deeds, in general is the going to and the"
11640,_SUMMARY._,"returning from Troy. The Homeric Cycle is Homer's account, in his two"
11641,_SUMMARY._,"poems, of this Trojan Cycle. Finally the Epic Cycle is the expansion of"
11642,_SUMMARY._,"Homer and includes a number of Epics, which fill out to ultimate"
11643,_SUMMARY._,"completeness the Trojan Cycle. The latter, according to Proclus, is"
11644,_SUMMARY._,"made up of six Epics beside the Iliad and Odyssey, to which they stand"
11645,_SUMMARY._,in the following relations.
11646,_SUMMARY._,
11647,_SUMMARY._,"1. The _Cypria_, which deals with events antecedent to the Iliad, such"
11648,_SUMMARY._,"as the apple of Discord, the visit of Paris at Sparta and the taking of"
11649,_SUMMARY._,"Helen, the mustering at Aulis, the sacrifice of Iphigeneia, and many"
11650,_SUMMARY._,"incidents at Troy. Ulysses, to avoid going to the war, feigns madness"
11651,_SUMMARY._,(his first disguise) and ploughs the sea-sand; but he is detected by
11652,_SUMMARY._,Palamedes who lays his infant Telemachus in the track of the plough.
11653,_SUMMARY._,"The name _Cypria_ comes from Kypris, Venus, who caused the infatuation"
11654,_SUMMARY._,which led to the war.
11655,_SUMMARY._,
11656,_SUMMARY._,2. Four different epics fill in between the Iliad and the Odyssey. The
11657,_SUMMARY._,"_Æthiopis_ takes up the thread after the death of Hector, introducing"
11658,_SUMMARY._,"Penthesilea, Queen of the Amazons, and Memnon, son of the Dawn, both of"
11659,_SUMMARY._,whom are slain by Achilles who is himself slain and is buried with
11660,_SUMMARY._,"funeral games. After the death of Achilles, the _Little Iliad_"
11661,_SUMMARY._,"continues the story, installing Ulysses as hero over Ajax in the"
11662,_SUMMARY._,contest for the arms of Achilles. This is the grand transition from
11663,_SUMMARY._,"Brawn to Brain in the conduct of the war. The Wooden Horse is made, and"
11664,_SUMMARY._,the Palladium is carried out of Troy--both deeds being the product of
11665,_SUMMARY._,"the brain, if not of the hand, of Ulysses. Next comes the _Sack of"
11666,_SUMMARY._,"Troy_, whose name indicates its character. Laocoon and Sinon appear in"
11667,_SUMMARY._,"it, but the main thing is the grand slaughter (like that of the"
11668,_SUMMARY._,Suitors) and the dragging of women and children into captivity; the
11669,_SUMMARY._,city is burned. Then follows the epic called the _Nostoi_ or the
11670,_SUMMARY._,"Returns, really an elaboration of the Odyssey, specially of the Third"
11671,_SUMMARY._,"Book, which tells of these antecedent Returns. Then comes the great"
11672,_SUMMARY._,"Return, which is the Odyssey."
11673,_SUMMARY._,
11674,_SUMMARY._,3. After the Odyssey follows the _Telegonia_ written by Eugammon of
11675,_SUMMARY._,Cyrene in two Books. It continues the life of Ulysses; he now goes to
11676,_SUMMARY._,"that people who take an oar for winnowing fan, and there he makes the"
11677,_SUMMARY._,"offering to Neptune, enjoined by Tiresias in Hades. Other incidents are"
11678,_SUMMARY._,narrated; the final winding-up is that Ulysses is unwittingly slain by
11679,_SUMMARY._,"Telegonus, his and Circe's son, who appears in Ithaca and takes"
11680,_SUMMARY._,"Telemachus and Penelope to Circe, who makes them immortal. The grand"
11681,_SUMMARY._,Epic Cycle concludes with the strangest set of marriages on record:
11682,_SUMMARY._,"Telegonus marries Penelope, his step-mother, and Telemachus marries"
11683,_SUMMARY._,Circe who is also a kind of step-mother.
11684,_SUMMARY._,
11685,_SUMMARY._,"III. After such a literary bankruptcy, it is no wonder that we find the"
11686,_SUMMARY._,later Greek and Roman writers using the words _cyclic_ and _cyclic
11687,_SUMMARY._,poet_ as terms of disparagement. The great Mythus of Troy had run its
11688,_SUMMARY._,"course and exhausted itself; the age of imitation, formalism, erudition"
11689,_SUMMARY._,"had come, while that of creation had passed away. Still it has"
11690,_SUMMARY._,"preserved for us the idea of the cycle, which is necessary for the"
11691,_SUMMARY._,"adequate comprehension of Homer, and which the Greeks themselves"
11692,_SUMMARY._,conceived and employed.
11693,_SUMMARY._,
11694,_SUMMARY._,_Structure of the Odyssey._ A brief summary of the structural elements
11695,_SUMMARY._,"of the poem may now be set forth. It falls into two grand divisions,"
11696,_SUMMARY._,both of which are planned by Pallas in Book I and XIII respectively. In
11697,_SUMMARY._,the main these divisions are the following:--
11698,_SUMMARY._,
11699,_SUMMARY._,"I. The first takes up about one-half of the Odyssey--twelve Books,"
11700,_SUMMARY._,which have as their chief object instruction and discipline--the
11701,_SUMMARY._,training for the deed. This training has two very distinct
11702,_SUMMARY._,"portions, as it pertains to a young man and a middle-aged"
11703,_SUMMARY._,man--Telemachiad and Ulyssiad.
11704,_SUMMARY._,
11705,_SUMMARY._,"1. The Telemachiad, or the education of Telemachus, who has been"
11706,_SUMMARY._,"left without the influence of his father, when the latter went"
11707,_SUMMARY._,"to Troy. But he has his father's spirit, hence he must know;"
11708,_SUMMARY._,from Ithaca he goes to Nestor and Menelaus for instruction. Four
11709,_SUMMARY._,Books.
11710,_SUMMARY._,
11711,_SUMMARY._,"2. The Ulyssiad, or the discipline of Ulysses, who must have"
11712,_SUMMARY._,been a man over 40 years old. He is to be trained out of the
11713,_SUMMARY._,negative spirit which he imbibed from the Trojan war. Herein
11714,_SUMMARY._,"lies his analogy to Faust, who is also a middle-aged man, and"
11715,_SUMMARY._,"negative, but from study and thought."
11716,_SUMMARY._,
11717,_SUMMARY._,Both the Telemachiad and the Ulyssiad are essentially one great
11718,_SUMMARY._,"movement in two phases, showing the bud and the flower, the young and"
11719,_SUMMARY._,the mature man. Father and son reveal an overcoming of limitation;
11720,_SUMMARY._,"Telemachus overcomes his limit of ignorance, Ulysses overcomes his"
11721,_SUMMARY._,"limit of negation--the one by the instruction of the wise, the other by"
11722,_SUMMARY._,the experience of life. Both are trained to a belief in an ethical
11723,_SUMMARY._,order which rules the world; therein both are made internally ready for
11724,_SUMMARY._,the great act of delivering their country. The training of both reaches
11725,_SUMMARY._,forward to a supreme practical end--the destruction of the Suitors and
11726,_SUMMARY._,the purification of Ithaca. (For the further structure of these two
11727,_SUMMARY._,parts--the Telemachiad and the Ulyssiad--see preceding commentary under
11728,_SUMMARY._,these titles.)
11729,_SUMMARY._,
11730,_SUMMARY._,II. The second grand division of the Odyssey is the last twelve Books.
11731,_SUMMARY._,"The scene is laid in Ithaca, where the great deed, to which the poem"
11732,_SUMMARY._,"hitherto has looked forward, is to be done. The wanderings of the"
11733,_SUMMARY._,"father have ceased, the son returns from his schooling; every movement"
11734,_SUMMARY._,is now directed toward action. Again Pallas (XIII. 393-415) plans two
11735,_SUMMARY._,"subdivisions, without the Council of the Gods however."
11736,_SUMMARY._,
11737,_SUMMARY._,1. The hut of the swineherd. Here the forces hostile to the Suitors
11738,_SUMMARY._,"gather in secret and lay their plan. Ulysses, Telemachus, Eumæus, the"
11739,_SUMMARY._,"gallant army of three, get ready for the execution of the deed. Four"
11740,_SUMMARY._,Books.
11741,_SUMMARY._,
11742,_SUMMARY._,2. The palace of the King. Ulysses in disguise beholds the Suitors in
11743,_SUMMARY._,"their negative acts; they are as bad as the Trojans, assailing"
11744,_SUMMARY._,"Property, Family, State, the Gods; they are really in their way"
11745,_SUMMARY._,"re-enacting the rape of Helen. Ulysses, as he destroyed Troy, must"
11746,_SUMMARY._,"destroy them, yet not become merely destructive himself. Eight Books,"
11747,_SUMMARY._,in which we can discern the following movement: (1) Suitors as
11748,_SUMMARY._,destroyers--five Books; (2) Ulysses as destroyer--one Book; (3) Ulysses
11749,_SUMMARY._,as restorer--two Books. Thus the outcome is positive..
11750,_SUMMARY._,
11751,_SUMMARY._,"The career of Ulysses is now complete, and with it the Homeric Cycle"
11752,_SUMMARY._,has rounded itself out to fullness. The Epic Cycle in the _Telegonia_
11753,_SUMMARY._,"will expand this conclusion, but will deeply mar its idea."
11754,_SUMMARY._,
11755,_SUMMARY._,Note that the structure of the two grand divisions of the Odyssey are
11756,_SUMMARY._,"symmetrical, each a half of the poem; then each half subdivides into"
11757,_SUMMARY._,"two parts, and each of those parts is symmetrical, being composed of"
11758,_SUMMARY._,"four and eight Books each. To be sure, the joint is not so plain in the"
11759,_SUMMARY._,"second division as in the first, which has the Telemachiad and the"
11760,_SUMMARY._,"Ulyssiad. Pallas is the orderer of both divisions, and she orders them"
11761,_SUMMARY._,in a symmetrical manner.
11762,_SUMMARY._,
11763,_SUMMARY._,"For both divisions the grand horizon is the Trojan War, yet both reach"
11764,_SUMMARY._,"beyond it, the one toward the West, the other toward the East. The one"
11765,_SUMMARY._,"weaves into its regular narrative the Fairy Tale, the other takes up"
11766,_SUMMARY._,into its text what we have called the Romantic Novelette. The former
11767,_SUMMARY._,"looks toward the West and the Future, the latter looks back at the East"
11768,_SUMMARY._,and the Past. Hence the Fairy Tale is prophetic and has supernatural
11769,_SUMMARY._,"beings, the Novelette is retrospective, giving the experiences of life"
11770,_SUMMARY._,without supernatural agencies. In scenery also the contrast is great:
11771,_SUMMARY._,"the one is largely a sea poem, the other is a land poem."
11772,_SUMMARY._,
11773,_SUMMARY._,"_Structural analogy between Iliad and Odyssey._ We have before said,"
11774,_SUMMARY._,"and we may repeat here at the end, that the final fruit of Homeric"
11775,_SUMMARY._,study is to see and to fully realize that the Iliad and Odyssey are one
11776,_SUMMARY._,"work, showing national consciousness, and unfolding one great epoch of"
11777,_SUMMARY._,the World's History. Just here we may note the fundamental analogies of
11778,_SUMMARY._,structure between the two poems.
11779,_SUMMARY._,
11780,_SUMMARY._,"I. Both poems have the dual division, separating into two symmetrical"
11781,_SUMMARY._,"portions. The Iliad has two Wraths of Achilles, and also two"
11782,_SUMMARY._,Reconciliations; thus each division is subdivided:
11783,_SUMMARY._,
11784,_SUMMARY._,1. His first attitude or cycle of conduct toward the Greeks.
11785,_SUMMARY._,
11786,_SUMMARY._,(_a_) His wrath--both rightful and wrongful.
11787,_SUMMARY._,
11788,_SUMMARY._,(_b_) His reconciliation with Agamemnon and his own people.
11789,_SUMMARY._,
11790,_SUMMARY._,"2. His second attitude, or cycle of conduct toward the Trojans."
11791,_SUMMARY._,
11792,_SUMMARY._,(_a_) His wrath--both rightful and wrongful.
11793,_SUMMARY._,
11794,_SUMMARY._,(_b_) His reconciliation with Priam and the Trojans.
11795,_SUMMARY._,
11796,_SUMMARY._,Such is the general organism of the Iliad which is seen to be perfectly
11797,_SUMMARY._,symmetrical within itself. (For a fuller account see author's
11798,_SUMMARY._,"Commentary on the Iliad, pp. 36-8.) Note that the negative attitude of"
11799,_SUMMARY._,Achilles is that of wrath; in his anger he will destroy his people and
11800,_SUMMARY._,"his cause, and finally, in the dragging of Hector's corpse, he"
11801,_SUMMARY._,disregards the Gods. Yet be overcomes both these negative attitudes in
11802,_SUMMARY._,himself and becomes reconciled.
11803,_SUMMARY._,
11804,_SUMMARY._,"II. The Odyssey has two phases of Negation, both of which the heroes"
11805,_SUMMARY._,(father and son) must overcome.
11806,_SUMMARY._,
11807,_SUMMARY._,1. The negative spirit caused by the Trojan War and its overcoming.
11808,_SUMMARY._,
11809,_SUMMARY._,(_a_) The ignorance of the son and its overcoming.
11810,_SUMMARY._,
11811,_SUMMARY._,(_b_) The destructive tendency of the father and its overcoming.
11812,_SUMMARY._,
11813,_SUMMARY._,2. The negative spirit abroad in Ithaca (Suitors) and its overcoming.
11814,_SUMMARY._,
11815,_SUMMARY._,(_a_) The hut of the swineherd (preparation).
11816,_SUMMARY._,
11817,_SUMMARY._,(_b_) The palace of the King (execution).
11818,_SUMMARY._,
11819,_SUMMARY._,"That is, Ulysses and Telemachus have the double problem, which"
11820,_SUMMARY._,"organizes the Odyssey: they must conquer their own internal negation,"
11821,_SUMMARY._,then proceed to conquer that of the Suitors. Both poems divide alike;
11822,_SUMMARY._,both have the same fundamental thought: the individual as hero is to
11823,_SUMMARY._,"master his own negative spirit and that of the world, and then be"
11824,_SUMMARY._,reconciled with himself and the world. The Iliad has essentially but
11825,_SUMMARY._,"one thread of movement, that of Achilles; the Odyssey has two such"
11826,_SUMMARY._,"threads, if not three--father, son, and perchance wife, making the"
11827,_SUMMARY._,total Family as the unit of movement.
11828,_SUMMARY._,
11829,_SUMMARY._,"Thus the Iliad and Odyssey are one poem fundamentally, showing unity in"
11830,_SUMMARY._,"thought and structure, and portraying one complete cycle of national"
11831,_SUMMARY._,"consciousness, as well as one great phase of the World's History."
