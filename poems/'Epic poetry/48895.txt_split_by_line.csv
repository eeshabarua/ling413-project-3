173,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",
174,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","And that your Lordship may in his face take view of his mind, the first"
175,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","words of his Iliads is _μη̑νιν, wrath_; the first word of his Odysseys,"
176,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",_ἄνδρα man:_ contracting in either word his each work’s proposition. In
177,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",one _predominant perturbation;_ in the other _over-ruling wisdom._ In
178,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",one the body’s fervour and fashion of outward fortitude to all possible
179,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","height of heroical action; in the other the mind’s inward, constant,"
180,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","and unconquered empire, unbroken, unaltered, with any most insolent,"
181,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",and tyrannous infliction. To many most sovereign praises is this poem
182,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","entitled; but to that grace, in chief, which sets on the crown both of"
183,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","poets and orators; _τὸ τὰ μικρὰ μεγάλως, καὶ τὰ κοινὰ καιίνως:_"
184,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","that is, _Parva magnè dicere; pervulgata novè; jejuna plenè.—To speak"
185,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",things little greatly; things common rarely; things barren and empty
186,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",fruitfully and fully._ The return of a man into his country is his
187,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","whole scope and object; which in itself, your Lordship may well say, is"
188,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","jejune and fruitless enough, affording nothing feastful, nothing"
189,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","magnificent. And yet even this doth the divine inspiration render vast,"
190,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","illustrious, and of miraculous composure. And for this, my Lord, is"
191,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","this poem preferred to his lliads; for therein much magnificence, both"
192,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","of person and action, gives great aid to his industry; but in this are"
193,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","these helps exceeding sparing, or nothing; and yet is the structure so"
194,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","elaborate and pompous that the poor plain ground-work, considered"
195,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","together, may seem the naturally rich womb to it, and produce it"
196,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","needfully. Much wondered at, therefore, is the censure of Dionysius"
197,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","Longinus, (a man otherwise affirmed grave and of elegant judgment,)"
198,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","comparing Homer in his Iliads to the Sun rising, in his Odysseys to his"
199,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","descent or setting, or to the ocean robbed of his æsture, many"
200,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",tributary floods and rivers of excellent ornament withheld from their
201,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","observance. When this his work so far exceeds the ocean, with all his"
202,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","court and concourse, that all his sea is only a serviceable stream to"
203,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","it. Nor can it be compared to any one power to be named in nature,"
204,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",being an entirely well-sorted and digested confluence of all; where the
205,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",most solid and grave is made as nimble and fluent as the most airy and
206,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","fiery, the nimble and fluent as firm and well-bounded as the most grave"
207,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","and solid. And, taking all together, of so tender impression, and of"
208,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","such command to the voice of the Muse, that they knock heaven with her"
209,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","breath, and discover their foundations as low as hell. Nor is this"
210,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",all-comprising Poesy fantastic or mere fictive; but the most material
211,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","and doctrinal illations of truth, both for all manly information of"
212,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","manners in the young, all prescription of justice, and even Christian"
213,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","piety, in the most grave and high governed. To illustrate both which,"
214,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","in both kinds, with all heightof expression, the Poet creates both a"
215,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","body and a soul in them. Wherein, if the body (being the letter or"
216,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","history) seems fictive, and beyond possibility to bring into act, the"
217,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","sense then and allegory, which is the soul, is to be sought, which"
218,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","intends a more eminent expressure of Virtue for her loveliness, and of"
219,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","Vice for her ugliness, in their several effects; going beyond the life"
220,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",than any art within life can possibly delineate. Why then is fiction to
221,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",this end so hateful to our true ignorants? Or why should a poor
222,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",chronicler of a Lord Mayor’s naked truth (that peradventure will last
223,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",his year) include more worth with our modern wizards than Homer for his
224,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","naked Ulysses clad in eternal fiction? But this proser Dionysius, and"
225,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",the rest of these grave and reputatively learned—that dare undertake
226,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","for their gravities the headstrong censure of all things, and challenge"
227,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",the understanding of these toys in their childhoods; when even these
228,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",childish vanities retain deep and most necessary learning enough in
229,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","them to make them children in their ages, and teach them while they"
230,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",live—are not in these absolute divine infusions allowed either voice or
231,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","relish: for, _Qui Poeticas ad fores accedit, etc._ (says the divine"
232,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","philosopher) he that knocks at the gates of the Muses, _sine Musarum"
233,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","furore,_ is neither to be admitted entry, nor a touch at their"
234,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","thresholds; his opinion of entry ridiculous, and his presumption"
235,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",impious. Nor must Poets themselves (might I a little insist on these
236,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","contempts, not tempting too far your Lordship’s Ulyssean patience)"
237,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",presume to these doors without the truly genuine and peculiar
238,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","induction. There being in Poesy a twofold rapture,—or alienation of"
239,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","soul, as the abovesaid teacher terms it,—one _insania,_ a disease of"
240,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","the mind, and a mere madness, by which the infected is thrust beneath"
241,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","all the degrees of humanity: _et ex homine, brutum quodammodò"
242,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","redditur:_—(for which poor Poesy, in this diseased and impostorous age,"
243,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","is so barbarously vilified;)—the other is, _divinus furor,_ by which"
244,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","the sound and divinely healthful _suprà hominis naturam erigitur, et in"
245,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",Deum transit._ One a perfection directly infused from God; the other an
246,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",infection obliquely and degenerately proceeding from man. Of the divine
247,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","fury, my Lord, your Homer hath ever been both first and last instance;"
248,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","being pronounced absolutely, _τὸν σοφώτατον, καὶ τὸν θειότατον"
249,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","ποιητήν,_ “the most wise and most divine poet.” Against whom whosoever"
250,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",shall open his profane mouth may worthily receive answer with this of
251,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","his divine defender—Empedocles, Heraclitus, Protagoras, Epicharmus,"
252,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","etc., being of Homer’s part—_τίς οο͒ν,_ etc.; who against such an army,"
253,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","and the general Homer, dares attempt the assault, but he must be"
254,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","reputed ridiculous? And yet against this host, and this invincible"
255,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","commander, shall we have every _besogne_ and fool a leader. The common"
256,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","herd, I assure myself, ready to receive it on their horns. Their"
257,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","infected leaders,"
258,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",
259,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","Such men as sideling ride the ambling Muse,"
260,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",Whose saddle is as frequent as the stews.
261,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","Whose raptures are in ev’ry pageant seen,"
262,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",In ev’ry wassail-rhyme and dancing-green;
263,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",When he that writes by any beam of truth
264,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","Must dive as deep as he, past shallow youth."
265,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","Truth dwells in gulfs, whose deeps hide shades so rich"
266,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","That Night sits muffled there in clouds of pitch,"
267,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","More dark than Nature made her, and requires,"
268,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","To clear her tough mists, heav’n’s great fire of fires,"
269,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",To whom the sun itself is but a beam.
270,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",For sick souls then—but rapt in foolish dream—
271,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","To wrastle with these heav’n-strong mysteries,"
272,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",What madness is it? when their light serves eyes
273,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","That are not worldly in their least aspect,"
274,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","But truly pure, and aim at heav’n direct."
275,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",Yet these none like but what the brazen head
276,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","Blatters abroad, no sooner born but dead."
277,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",
278,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","Holding, then, in eternal contempt, my Lord, those short-lived bubbles,"
279,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","eternize your virtue and judgment with the Grecian monarch; esteeming,"
280,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","not as the least of your new-year’s presents,"
281,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",
282,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","Homer, three thousand years dead, now reviv’d,"
283,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",Ev’n from that dull death that in life he liv’d;
284,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","When none conceited him, none understood"
285,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",That so much life in so much death as blood
286,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",Conveys about it could mix. But when death
287,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",Drunk up the bloody mist that human breath
288,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",Pour’d round about him—poverty and spite.
289,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",Thick’ning the hapless vapour—then truth’s light
290,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",Glimmer’d about his poem; the pinch’d soul
291,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",(Amidst the mysteries it did enrol)
292,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",Brake pow’rfully abroad. And as we see
293,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","The sun all-hid in clouds, at length got free,"
294,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","Through some forc’d covert, over all the ways,"
295,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","Near and beneath him, shoots his vented rays"
296,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","Far off, and sticks them in some little glade,"
297,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","All woods, fields, rivers, left besides in shade;"
298,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","So your Apollo, from that world of light"
299,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","Clos’d in his poem’s body, shot to sight"
300,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","Some few forc’d beams, which near him were not seen,"
301,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",(As in his life or country) Fate and spleen
302,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","Clouding their radiance; which when Death had clear’d,"
303,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",To far-off regions his free beams appear’d;
304,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","In which all stood and wonder’d, striving which"
305,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",His birth and rapture should in right enrich.
306,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",Twelve labours of your Thespian Hercules
307,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",I now present your Lordship; do but please
308,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",To lend life means till th’ other twelve receive
309,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",Equal achievement; and let Death then reave
310,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","My life now lost in our patrician loves,"
311,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",That knock heads with the herd; in whom there moves
312,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","One blood, one soul, both drown’d in one set height"
313,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",Of stupid envy and mere popular spite.
314,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",Whose loves with no good did my least vein fill;
315,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",And from their hates I fear as little ill.
316,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","Their bounties nourish not when most they feed,"
317,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","But, where there is no merit or no need,"
318,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","Rain into rivers still, and are such show’rs"
319,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",As bubbles spring and overflow the flow’rs.
320,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","Their worse parts and worst men their best suborns,"
321,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",Like winter cows whose milk runs to their horns.
322,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",And as litigious clients’ books of law
323,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",Cost infinitely; taste of all the awe
324,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","Bench’d in our kingdom’s policy, piety, state;"
325,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",Earn all their deep explorings; satiate
326,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",All sorts there thrust together by the heart
327,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",With thirst of wisdom spent on either part;
328,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",Horrid examples made of Life and Death
329,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.",From their fine stuff wov’n; yet when once the breath
330,"LORD CHAMBERLAIN, ETC.","Of sentence leaves them, all their worth is drawn"

594,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She made her stand, and, for her breast’s support,"
595,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Lean’d on her iron lance; her form imprest

597,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There found she those proud wooers, that were then"

600,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To them the heralds, and the rest obeying,"
601,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fill’d wine and water; some, still as they play’d,"
602,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And some, for solemn supper’s state, purvey’d,"

612,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In this discourse, he first saw Pallas standing,"
613,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Unbidden entry; up rose, and addrest"
614,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His pace right to her, angry that a guest"
615,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Should stand so long at gate; and, coming near,"
616,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her right hand took, took in his own her spear,"
617,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thus saluted: “Grace to your repair,"
618,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fair guest, your welcome shall be likewise fair."
619,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Enter, and, cheer’d with feast, disclose th’ intent"
620,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That caus’d your coming.” This said, first he went,"
621,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Pallas follow’d. To a room they came,"
622,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Steep, and of state; the jav’lin of the Dame"
623,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He set against a pillar vast and high,"
624,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amidst a large and bright-kept armory,"
625,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which was, besides, with woods of lances grac’d"
626,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of his grave father’s. In a throne he plac’d
627,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The man-turn’d Goddess, under which was spread"
628,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A carpet, rich and of deviceful thread;"
629,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A footstool staying her feet; and by her chair
630,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Another seat (all garnish’d wondrous fair,"
631,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To rest or sleep on in the day) he set,"
632,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Far from the prease of wooers, lest at meat"
633,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The noise they still made might offend his guest,"
634,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Disturbing him at banquet or at rest,"
635,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n to his combat with that pride of theirs,"
636,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That kept no noble form in their affairs.
637,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And these he set far from them, much the rather"
638,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To question freely of his absent father.
639,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A table fairly-polish’d then was spread,"
640,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On which a rev’rend officer set bread,"
641,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And other servitors all sorts of meat
642,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Salads, and flesh, such as their haste could get)"
643,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Serv’d with observance in. And then the sewer
644,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pour’d water from a great and golden ewer,"
645,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That from their hands t’ a silver caldron ran.
646,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both wash’d, and seated close, the voiceful man"
647,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fetch’d cups of gold, and set by them, and round"
648,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Those cups with wine with all endeavour crown’d.
649,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then rush’d in the rude wooers, themselves plac’d;"
650,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The heralds water gave; the maids in haste
651,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Serv’d bread from baskets. When, of all prepar’d"
652,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And set before them, the bold wooers shar’d,"
653,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their pages plying their cups past the rest.
654,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But lusty wooers must do more than feast;
655,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For now, their hungers and their thirsts allay’d,"
656,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They call’d for songs and dances; those, they said,"
657,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Were th’ ornaments of feast. The herald straight
658,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A harp, carv’d full of artificial sleight,"
659,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thrust into Phemius’, a learn’d singer’s, hand,"
660,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who, till he much was urg’d, on terms did stand,"
661,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, after, play’d and sung with all his art."
662,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Telemachus to Pallas then (apart,"
663,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His ear inclining close, that none might hear)"
664,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In this sort said: “My guest, exceeding dear,"
665,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Will you not sit incens’d with what I say?
666,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,These are the cares these men take; feast and play.
667,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which eas’ly they may use, because they eat,"
668,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Free and unpunish’d, of another’s meat;"
669,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And of a man’s, whose white bones wasting lie"
670,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In some far region; with th’ incessancy
671,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of show’rs pour’d down upon them, lying ashore,"
672,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or in the seas wash’d nak’d. Who, if he wore"
673,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Those bones with flesh and life and industry,"
674,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And these might here in Ithaca set eye
675,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On him return’d, they all would wish to be"
676,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Either past other in celerity
677,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of feet and knees, and not contend t’ exceed"
678,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In golden garments. But his virtues feed
679,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The fate of ill death; nor is left to me
680,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The least hope of his life’s recovery,"
681,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No, not if any of the mortal race"
682,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Should tell me his return; the cheerful face
683,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of his return’d day never will appear.
684,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But tell me, and let Truth your witness bear,"
685,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who, and from whence you are? What city’s birth?"
686,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,What parents? In what vessel set you forth?
687,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And with what mariners arriv’d you here?
688,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I cannot think you a foot passenger.
689,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Recount then to me all, to teach me well"
690,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Fit usage for your worth. And if it fell
691,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In chance now first that you thus see us here,"
692,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or that in former passages you were
693,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My father’s guest? For many men have been
694,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Guests to my father. Studious of men
695,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His sociable nature ever was.”
696,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,On him again the grey-eyed Maid did pass
697,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This kind reply: “I’ll answer passing true
698,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All thou hast ask’d: My birth his honour drew
699,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From wise Anchialus. The name I bear

711,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Apart this city, in the harbour call’d"
712,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rhethrus, whose waves with Neius’ woods are wall’d."
713,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy sire and I were ever mutual guests,"
714,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,At either’s house still interchanging feasts.
715,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I glory in it. Ask, when thou shalt see"
716,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Laertes, th’ old heroë, these of me,"
717,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From the beginning. He, men say, no more"
718,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Visits the city, but will needs deplore"
719,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His son’s believ’d loss in a private field;
720,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,One old maid only at his hands to yield
721,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Food to his life, as oft as labour makes"
722,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His old limbs faint; which, though he creeps, he takes"
723,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Along a fruitful plain, set all with vines,"
724,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which husbandman-like, though a king, he proins."
725,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But now I come to be thy father’s guest;
726,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I hear he wanders, while these wooers feast."
727,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And (as th’ Immortals prompt me at this hour)
728,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I’ll tell thee, out of a prophetic pow’r,"
729,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Not as profess’d a prophet, nor clear seen"
730,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,At all times what shall after chance to men)
731,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What I conceive, for this time, will be true:"
732,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Gods’ inflictions keep your sire from you.
733,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Divine Ulysses, yet, abides not dead"
734,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Above earth, nor beneath, nor buried"
735,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In any seas, as you did late conceive,"
736,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, with the broad sea sieg’d, is kept alive"
737,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Within an isle by rude and upland men,"
738,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That in his spite his passage home detain.
739,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Yet long it shall not be before he tread
740,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His country’s dear earth, though solicited,"
741,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And held from his return, with iron chains;"
742,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For he hath wit to forge a world of trains,"
743,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And will, of all, be sure to make good one"
744,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For his return, so much relied upon."
745,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But tell me, and be true: Art thou indeed"
746,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So much a son, as to be said the seed[8]"
747,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of Ithacus himself? Exceeding much
748,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy forehead and fair eyes at his form touch;
749,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For oftentimes we met, as you and I"
750,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Meet at this hour, before he did apply"
751,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His pow’rs for Troy, when other Grecian states"
752,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In hollow ships were his associates.
753,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, since that time, mine eyes could never see"
754,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Renown’d Ulysses, nor met his with me.”"
755,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The wise Telemachus again replied:
756,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“You shall with all I know be satisfied.
757,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My mother certain says I am his son;
758,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I know not; nor was ever simply known
759,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By any child the sure truth of his sire.
760,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But would my veins had took in living fire
761,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From some man happy, rather than one wise,"
762,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whom age might see seis’d of what youth made prise.
763,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But he whoever of the mortal race
764,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is most unblest, he holds my father’s place."
765,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This, since you ask, I answer.” She, again:"
766,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“The Gods sure did not make the future strain
767,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both of thy race and days obscure to thee,"
768,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since thou wert born so of Penelope.
769,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The style may by thy after acts be won,"
770,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of so great sire the high undoubted son.
771,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Say truth in this then: What’s this feasting here?
772,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,What all this rout? Is all this nuptial cheer?
773,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or else some friendly banquet made by thee?
774,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For here no shots are, where all sharers be."
775,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Past measure contumeliously this crew
776,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Fare through thy house; which should th’ ingenuous view
777,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of any good or wise man come and find,"
778,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Impiety seeing play’d in ev’ry kind)
779,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He could not but through ev’ry vein be mov’d.”
780,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Again Telemachus: “My guest much lov’d.
781,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since you demand and sift these sights so far,"
782,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I grant ’twere fit a house so regular,"
783,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rich, and so faultless once in government,"
784,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Should still at all parts the same form present
785,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That gave it glory while her lord was here.
786,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But now the Gods, that us displeasure bear,"
787,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Have otherwise appointed, and disgrace"
788,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My father most of all the mortal race.
789,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For whom I could not mourn so were he dead,"
790,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amongst his fellow-captains slaughteréd
791,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By common enemies, or in the hands"
792,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his kind friends had ended his commands,"
793,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,After he had egregiously bestow’d
794,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His pow’r and order in a war so vow’d,"
795,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And to his tomb all Greeks their grace had done,"
796,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That to all ages he might leave his son
797,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Immortal honour; but now Harpies have
798,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Digg’d in their gorges his abhorréd grave.
799,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Obscure, inglorious, death hath made his end,"
800,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And me, for glories, to all griefs contend."
801,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor shall I any more mourn him alone,"
802,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Gods have giv’n me other cause of moan.
803,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For look how many optimates remain
804,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In Samos, or the shores Dulichian,"
805,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shady Zacynthus, or how many bear"
806,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Rule in the rough brows of this island here;
807,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So many now my mother and this house
808,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,At all parts make defam’d and ruinous;
809,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And she her hateful nuptials nor denies,"
810,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor will despatch their importunities,"
811,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Though she beholds them spoil still as they feast
812,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All my free house yields, and the little rest"
813,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of my dead sire in me perhaps intend
814,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To bring ere long to some untimely end.”
815,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This Pallas sigh’d and answer’d: “O,” said she,"
816,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Absent Ulysses is much miss’d by thee,"
817,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That on these shameless suitors he might lay
818,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His wreakful hands. Should he now come, and stay"
819,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In thy court’s first gates, arm’d with helm and shield,"
820,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And two such darts as I have seen him wield,"
821,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When first I saw him in our Taphian court,"
822,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Feasting, and doing his desert’s disport;"
823,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When from Ephyrus he return’d by us
824,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From Ilus, son to Centaur Mermerus,"
825,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To whom he travell’d through the wat’ry dreads,"
826,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For bane to poison his sharp arrows’ heads,"
827,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That death, but touch’d, caus’d; which he would not give,"
828,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Because he fear’d the Gods that ever live
829,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Would plague such death with death; and yet their fear
830,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was to my father’s bosom not so dear
831,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As was thy father’s love; (for what he sought
832,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My loving father found him to a thought.)
833,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,If such as then Ulysses might but meet
834,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With these proud wooers, all were at his feet"
835,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But instant dead men, and their nuptialls"
836,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Would prove as bitter as their dying galls.
837,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But these things in the Gods’ knees are repos’d,"
838,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If his return shall see with wreak inclos’d,"
839,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These in his house, or he return no more;"
840,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And therefore I advise thee to explore
841,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All ways thyself, to set these wooers gone;"
842,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To which end give me fit attentión:
843,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To-morrow into solemn council call
844,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Greek heroës, and declare to all"
845,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(The Gods being witness) what thy pleasure is.
846,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Command to towns of their nativity
847,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,These frontless wooers. If thy mother’s mind
848,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stands to her second nuptials so inclin’d,"
849,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Return she to her royal father’s tow’rs,"
850,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where th’ one of these may wed her, and her dow’rs"
851,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Make rich, and such as may consort with grace"
852,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So dear a daughter of so great a race
853,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And thee I warn as well (if thou as well
854,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wilt hear and follow) take thy best-built sail,"
855,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With twenty oars mann’d, and haste t’ inquire"
856,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where the abode is of thy absent sire,"
857,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If any can inform thee, or thine ear"
858,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From Jove the fame of his retreat may hear,"
859,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For chiefly Jove gives all that honours men.
860,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Pylos first be thy addression then,"
861,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To god-like Nestor; thence to Sparta haste,"
862,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To gold-lock’d Menelaus, who was last"
863,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all the brass-arm’d Greeks that sail’d from Troy;
864,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And try from both these, if thou canst enjoy"
865,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"News of thy sire’s return’d life anywhere,"
866,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Though sad thou suffer’st in his search a year.
867,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If of his death thou hear’st, return thou home,"
868,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And to his memory erect a tomb,"
869,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Performing parent-rites, of feast and game,"
870,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pompous, and such as best may fit his fame;"
871,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And then thy mother a fit husband give.
872,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These past, consider how thou mayst deprive"
873,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of worthless life these wooers in thy house,"
874,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By open force, or projects enginous."
875,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Things childish fit not thee; th’ art so no more.
876,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hast thou not heard, how all men did adore"
877,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Divine Orestes, after he had slain"
878,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ægisthus murd’ring by a treach’rous train
879,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His famous father? Be then, my most lov’d,"
880,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Valiant and manly, ev’ry way approv’d"
881,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As great as he. I see thy person fit,"
882,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Noble thy mind, and excellent thy wit,"
883,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All giv’n thee so to use and manage here
884,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That ev’n past death they may their memories bear.
885,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In meantime I’ll descend to ship and men,"
886,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That much expect me. Be observant then
887,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of my advice, and careful to maintain"
888,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In equal acts thy royal father’s reign.”
889,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Telemachus replied: “You ope, fair guest,"
890,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A friend’s heart in your speech, as well exprest"
891,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As might a father serve t’ inform his son;
892,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All which sure place have in my memory won.
893,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Abide yet, though your voyage calls away,"
894,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, having bath’d, and dignified your stay"
895,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With some more honour, you may yet beside"
896,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Delight your mind by being gratified
897,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With some rich present taken in your way,"
898,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, as a jewel, your respect may lay"
899,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up in your treasury, bestow’d by me,"
900,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As free friends use to guests of such degree.”
901,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Detain me not,” said she, “so much inclin’d"
902,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To haste my voyage. What thy loved mind
903,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Commands to give, at my return this way,"
904,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bestow on me, that I directly may"
905,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Convey it home; which more of price to me
906,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The more it asks my recompense to thee.”
907,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, away grey-eyed Minerva flew,"
908,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Like to a mounting lark; and did endue
909,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His mind with strength and boldness, and much more"
910,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Made him his father long for than before;
911,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And weighing better who his guest might be,"
912,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He stood amaz’d, and thought a Deity"
913,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was there descended; to whose will he fram’d
914,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His pow’rs at all parts, and went so inflam’d"
915,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the wooers, who were silent set,"
916,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To hear a poet sing the sad retreat
917,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Greeks perform’d from Troy; which was from thence
918,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Proclaim’d by Pallas, pain of her offence."
919,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When which divine song was perceiv’d to bear
920,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That mournful subject by the list’ning ear
921,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of wise Penelope, Icarius’ seed,"
922,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who from an upper room had giv’n it heed,"
923,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Down she descended by a winding stair,"
924,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not solely, but the state in her repair"
925,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Two maids of honour made. And when this queen
926,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of women stoop’d so low, she might be seen"
927,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By all her wooers. In the door, aloof,"
928,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ent’ring the hall grac’d with a goodly roof,"
929,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She stood, in shade of graceful veils, implied"
930,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About her beauties; on her either side,"
931,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her honour’d women. When, to tears mov’d, thus"
932,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She chid the sacred singer: “Phemiüs,"
933,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,You know a number more of these great deeds
934,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Gods and men, that are the sacred seeds,"
935,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And proper subjects, of a poet’s song,"
936,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And those due pleasures that to men belong,"
937,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Besides these facts that furnish Troy’s retreat,"
938,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sing one of those to these, that round your seat"
939,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They may with silence sit, and taste their wine;"
940,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But cease this song, that through these ears of mine"
941,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Conveys deserv’d occasion to my heart
942,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of endless sorrows, of which the desert"
943,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In me unmeasur’d is past all these men,"
944,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So endless is the memory I retain,"
945,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And so desertful is that memory,"
946,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of such a man as hath a dignity
947,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So broad it spreads itself through all the pride
948,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of Greece and Argos.” To the queen replied
949,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Inspir’d Telemachus: “Why thus envies
950,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My mother him that fits societies[9]
951,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With so much harmony, to let him please"
952,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His own mind in his will to honour these?
953,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For these ingenious and first sort of men,[10]"
954,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That do immediately from Jove retain
955,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their singing raptures, are by Jove as well"
956,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Inspir’d with choice of what their songs impell,"
957,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove’s will is free in it, and therefore theirs."
958,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor is this man to blame, that the repairs"
959,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Greeks make homeward sings; for his fresh muse
960,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Men still most celebrate that sings most news.
961,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And therefore in his note your ears employ:
962,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For not Ulysses only lost in Troy
963,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The day of his return, but numbers more"
964,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The deadly ruins of his fortunes bore.
965,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Go you then in, and take your work in hand,"
966,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your web, and distaff; and your maids command"
967,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To ply their fit work. Words to men are due,"
968,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And those reproving counsels you pursue,"
969,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And most to me of all men, since I bear"
970,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The rule of all things that are manag’d here.”
971,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She went amaz’d away, and in her heart"
972,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Laid up the wisdom Pallas did impart
973,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To her lov’d son so lately, turn’d again"
974,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up to her chamber, and no more would reign"
975,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In manly counsels. To her women she
976,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Applied her sway; and to the wooers he
977,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Began new orders, other spirits bewray’d"
978,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Than those in spite of which the wooers sway’d.
979,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And (whiles his mother’s tears still wash’d her eyes,"
980,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Till grey Minerva did those tears surprise
981,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With timely sleep, and that her wooers did rouse"
982,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rude tumult up through all the shady house,"
983,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Dispos’d to sleep because their widow was)
984,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Telemachus this new-giv’n spirit did pass
985,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On their old insolence: “Ho! you that are,"
986,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My mother’s wooers! much too high ye bear
987,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your petulant spirits; sit; and, while ye may"
988,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Enjoy me in your banquets, see ye lay"
989,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These loud notes down, nor do this man the wrong,"
990,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Because my mother hath disliked his song,"
991,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To grace her interruption. ’Tis a thing
992,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Honest, and honour’d too, to hear one sing"
993,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Numbers so like the Gods in elegance,"
994,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As this man flows in. By the morn’s first light,[11]"
995,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I’ll call ye all before me in a Court,"
996,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That I may clearly banish your resort,"
997,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all your rudeness, from these roofs of mine."
998,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Away; and elsewhere in your feasts combine.
999,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Consume your own goods, and make mutual feast"
1000,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At either’s house. Or if ye still hold best,"
1001,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And for your humours’ more sufficéd fill,"
1002,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To feed, to spoil, because unpunish’d still,"
1003,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On other findings, spoil; but here I call"
1004,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Th’ Eternal Gods to witness, if it fall"
1005,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In my wish’d reach once to be dealing wreaks,"
1006,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By Jove’s high bounty, these your present checks"
1007,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To what I give in charge shall add more reins
1008,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To my revenge hereafter; and the pains
1009,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ye then must suffer shall pass all your pride
1010,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ever to see redress’d, or qualified.”"
1011,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At this all bit their lips, and did admire"
1012,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His words sent from him with such phrase and fire;
1013,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which so much mov’d them that Antinous,"
1014,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eupitheus’ son, cried out: “Telemachus!"
1015,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Gods, I think, have rapt thee to this height"
1016,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of elocution, and this great conceit"
1017,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of self-ability. We all may pray,"
1018,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That Jove invest not in this kingdom’s sway
1019,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy forward forces, which I see put forth"
1020,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A hot ambition in thee for thy birth.”
1021,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Be not offended,” he replied, “if I[12]"
1022,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall say, I would assume this empery,"
1023,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,If Jove gave leave. You are not he that sings:
1024,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,_The rule of kingdoms is the worst of things._
1025,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor is it ill, at all, to sway a throne;"
1026,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A man may quickly gain possession
1027,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of mighty riches, make a wondrous prize"
1028,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Set of his virtues; but the dignities
1029,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That deck a king, there are enough beside"
1030,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In this circumfluous isle that want no pride
1031,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To think them worthy of, as young as I,"
1032,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And old as you are. An ascent so high
1033,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My thoughts affect not. Dead is he that held
1034,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Desert of virtue to have so excell’d.
1035,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But of these turrets I will take on me
1036,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To be the absolute king, and reign as free,"
1037,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As did my father, over all his hand"
1038,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Left here in this house slaves to my command.”
1039,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eurymachus, the son of Polybus,"
1040,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To this made this reply: “Telemachus!
1041,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The girlond of this kingdom let the knees
1042,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of Deity run for; but the faculties
1043,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This house is seis’d of, and the turrets here,"
1044,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou shalt be lord of, nor shall any bear"
1045,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The least part off of all thou dost possess,"
1046,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As long as this land is no wilderness.
1047,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor rul’d by out-laws. But give these their pass,"
1048,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And tell me, best of princes, who he was"
1049,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That guested here so late? From whence? And what
1050,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In any region boasted he his state?
1051,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His race? His country? Brought he any news
1052,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of thy returning father? Or for dues
1053,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of moneys to him made he fit repair?
1054,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"How suddenly he rush’d into the air,"
1055,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor would sustain to stay and make him known!
1056,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His port show’d no debauch’d companion.”
1057,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He answer’d: “The return of my lov’d sire
1058,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Is past all hope; and should rude Fame inspire
1059,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From any place a flatt’ring messenger
1060,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With news of his survival, he should bear"
1061,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,No least belief off from my desp’rate love.
1062,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which if a sacred prophet should approve,"
1063,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Call’d by my mother for her care’s unrest,"
1064,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It should not move me. For my late fair guest,"
1065,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He was of old my father’s, touching here"
1066,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From sea-girt Taphos; and for name doth bear
1067,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mentas, the son of wise Anchialus;"
1068,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And governs all the Taphians studious
1069,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of navigation.” This he said, but knew"
1070,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It was a Goddess. These again withdrew
1071,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To dances and attraction of the song;
1072,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And while their pleasures did the time prolong,"
1073,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sable Even descended, and did steep"
1074,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The lids of all men in desire of sleep.
1075,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Telemachus, into a room built high,"
1076,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his illustrious court, and to the eye"
1077,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of circular prospect, to his bed ascended,"
1078,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And in his mind much weighty thought contended
1079,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Before him Euryclea (that well knew
1080,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All the observance of a handmaid’s due,"

1400,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tyro, Alcmena, and Mycena were"
1401,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To hold comparison in no degree,"
1402,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For solid brain, with wise Penelope."
1403,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yet, in her delays of us, she shows"
1404,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,No prophet’s skill with all the wit she owes;
1405,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For all this time thy goods and victuals go
1406,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To utter ruin; and shall ever so,"
1407,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,While thus the Gods her glorious mind dispose.
1408,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Glory herself may gain, but thou shalt lose"
1409,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy longings ev’n for necessary food,"
1410,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For we will never go where lies our good,"
1411,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor any other where, till this delay"
1412,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,She puts on all she quits with th’ endless stay
1413,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of some one of us, that to all the rest"
1414,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,May give free farewell with his nuptial feast.”
1415,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The wise young prince replied: “Antinous!
1416,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I may by no means turn out of my house
1417,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her that hath brought me forth and nourish’d me.
1418,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Besides, if quick or dead my father be"
1419,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In any region, yet abides in doubt;"
1420,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ’twill go hard, my means being so run out,"
1421,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To tender to Icarius again,"
1422,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,If he again my mother must maintain
1423,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In her retreat, the dow’r she brought with her."
1424,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then a double ill it will confer,"
1425,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both from my father and from God on me,"
1426,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When, thrust out of her house, on her bent knee,"
1427,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My mother shall the horrid Furies raise
1428,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With imprecations, and all men dispraise"
1429,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My part in her exposure. Never then
1430,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Will I perform this counsel. If your spleen
1431,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Swell at my courses, once more I command"
1432,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your absence from my house; some other’s hand
1433,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Charge with your banquets; on your own goods eat,"
1434,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And either other mutually in treat,"
1435,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At either of your houses, with your feast."
1436,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But if ye still esteem more sweet and best
1437,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Another’s spoil, so you still wreakless live,"
1438,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Gnaw, vermin-like, things sacred, no laws give[1]"
1439,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To your devouring; it remains that I
1440,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Invoke each Ever-living Deity,"
1441,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And vow, if Jove shall deign in any date"
1442,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pow’r of like pains for pleasure so past rate,"
1443,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From thenceforth look, where ye have revell’d so"
1444,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Unwreak’d, your ruins all shall undergo.”"
1445,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus spake Telemachus; t’ assure whose threat,"
1446,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Far-seeing Jove upon their pinions set
1447,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Two eagles from the high brows of a hill,"
1448,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, mounted on the Winds, together still"
1449,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their strokes extended; but arriving now
1450,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amidst the Council, over ev’ry brow"
1451,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shook their thick wings and, threat’ning death’s cold fears,"
1452,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their necks and cheeks tore with their eager seres;
1453,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then, on the court’s right hand away they flew,"
1454,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Above both court and city. With whose view,"
1455,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And study what events they might foretell
1456,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Council into admiration fell.
1457,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The old heroë, Halitherses, then,"
1458,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The son of Nestor, that of all old men,"
1459,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His peers in that court, only could foresee"
1460,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By flight of fowls man’s fixed destiny,"
1461,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"’Twixt them and their amaze, this interpos’d:"
1462,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Hear, Ithacensians, all your doubts disclos’d."
1463,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Wooers most are touch’d in this ostent,"
1464,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To whom are dangers great and imminent;
1465,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For now not long more shall Ulysses bear
1466,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lack of his most lov’d, but fills some place near,"
1467,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Addressing to these Wooers fate and death.
1468,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And many more this mischief menaceth
1469,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of us inhabiting this famous isle.
1470,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let us consult yet, in this long forewhile,"
1471,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,How to ourselves we may prevent this ill.
1472,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let these men rest secure, and revel still;"
1473,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though they might find it safer, if with us"
1474,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They would in time prevent what threats them thus;
1475,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since not without sure trial I foretell
1476,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These coming storms, but know their issue well."
1477,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For to Ulysses all things have event,"
1478,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As I foretold him, when for Ilion went"
1479,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The whole Greek fleet together, and with them"
1480,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Th’ abundant-in-all-counsels took the stream.
1481,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I told him, that, when much ill he had past,"
1482,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all his men were lost, he should at last,"
1483,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The twentieth year, turn home, to all unknown;"
1484,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All which effects are to perfection grown.”
1485,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eurymachus, the son of Polybus,"
1486,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Oppos’d this man’s presage, and answer’d thus:"
1487,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Hence, great in years, go, prophesy at home,"
1488,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy children teach to shun their ills to come.
1489,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In these superior far to thee am I.
1490,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A world of fowls beneath the sun-beams fly
1491,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That are not fit t’ inform a prophecy.
1492,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Besides, Ulysses perish’d long ago;"
1493,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And would thy fates to thee had destin’d so,"
1494,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since so thy so much prophecy had spar’d
1495,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy wronging of our rights, which, for reward"
1496,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Expected home with thee, hath summon’d us"
1497,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Within the anger of Telemachus.
1498,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But this I will presage, which shall be true:"
1499,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,If any spark of anger chance t’ ensue
1500,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy much old art in these deep auguries,"
1501,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In this young man incenséd by thy lies,"
1502,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ev’n to himself his anger shall confer
1503,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The greater anguish, and thine own ends err"
1504,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From all their objects; and, besides, thine age"
1505,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall feel a pain, to make thee curse presage"
1506,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With worthy cause, for it shall touch thee near."
1507,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But I will soon give end to all our fear,"
1508,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Preventing whatsoever chance can fall,"
1509,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In my suit to the young prince for us all,"
1510,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To send his mother to her father’s house,"
1511,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That he may sort her out a worthy spouse,"
1512,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And such a dow’r bestow, as may befit"
1513,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One lov’d, to leave her friends and follow it."
1514,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before which course be, I believe that none"
1515,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all the Greeks will cease th’ ambitión
1516,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of such a match. For, chance what can to us,"
1517,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We no man fear, no not Telemachus,"
1518,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Though ne’er so greatly spoken. Nor care we
1519,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For any threats of austere prophecy,"
1520,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which thou, old dotard, vaunt’st of so in vain."
1521,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And thus shalt thou in much more hate remain;
1522,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For still the Gods shall bear their ill expense,"
1523,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor ever be dispos’d by competence,"
1524,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Till with her nuptials she dismiss our suits,"
1525,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our whole lives’ days shall sow hopes for such fruits.
1526,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her virtues we contend to, nor will go"
1527,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To any other, be she never so"
1528,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Worthy of us, and all the worth we owe.”"
1529,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He answer’d him: “Eurymachus, and all"
1530,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ye gen’rous Wooers, now, in general,"
1531,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I see your brave resolves, and will no more"
1532,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Make speech of these points, and, much less, implore."
1533,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It is enough, that all the Grecians here,"
1534,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all the Gods besides, just witness bear,"
1535,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,What friendly premonitions have been spent
1536,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On your forbearance, and their vain event."
1537,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet, with my other friends, let love prevail"
1538,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To fit me with a vessel free of sail,"
1539,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And twenty men, that may divide to me"
1540,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My ready passage through the yielding sea
1541,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For Sparta, and Amathoan Pylos’ shore,"
1542,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I now am bound, in purpose to explore"
1543,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My long-lack’d father, and to try if fame"
1544,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or Jove, most author of man’s honour’d name,"
1545,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With his return and life may glad mine ear,"
1546,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Though toil’d in that proof I sustain a year.
1547,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If dead I hear him, nor of more state, here"
1548,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Retir’d to my lov’d country, I will rear"
1549,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A sepulchre to him, and celebrate"
1550,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Such royal parent-rites, as fits his state;"
1551,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And then my mother to a spouse dispose.”
1552,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he sat; and to the rest arose"
1553,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mentor, that was Ulysses’ chosen friend,"
1554,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To whom, when he set forth, he did commend"
1555,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His cómplete family, and whom he will’d"
1556,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To see the mind of his old sire fulfill’d,"
1557,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All things conserving safe, till his retreat."
1558,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who, tender of his charge, and seeing so set"
1559,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In slight care of their king his subjects there,"
1560,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Suff’ring his son so much contempt to bear,"
1561,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus gravely, and with zeal, to him began:"
1562,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“No more let any sceptre-bearing man,"
1563,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Benevolent, or mild, or human be,"
1564,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor in his mind form acts of piety,"
1565,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But ever feed on blood, and facts unjust"
1566,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Commit, ev’n to the full swing of his lust,"
1567,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since of divine Ulysses no man now,"
1568,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all his subjects, any thought doth show."
1569,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All whom he govern’d, and became to them,"
1570,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rather than one that wore a diadem,"
1571,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A most indulgent father. But, for all"
1572,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That can touch me, within no envy fall"
1573,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These insolent Wooers, that in violent kind"
1574,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Commit things foul by th’ ill wit of the mind,"
1575,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And with the hazard of their heads devour
1576,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses’ house, since his returning hour"
1577,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They hold past hope. But it affects me much,"
1578,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ye dull plebeians, that all this doth touch"
1579,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your free states nothing; who, struck dumb, afford"
1580,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These Wooers not so much wreak as a word,"
1581,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though few, and you with only number might"
1582,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Extinguish to them the profaned light.”
1583,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Evenor’s son, Leocritus, replied:"
1584,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Mentor! the railer, made a fool with pride,"
1585,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,What language giv’st thou that would quiet us
1586,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With putting us in storm, exciting thus"
1587,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The rout against us? Who, though more than we,"
1588,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Should find it is no easy victory
1589,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To drive men, habited in feast, from feasts,"
1590,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,No not if Ithacus himself such guests
1591,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Should come and find so furnishing his Court,"
1592,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And hope to force them from so sweet a fort.
1593,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His wife should little joy in his arrive,"
1594,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though much she wants him; for, where she alive"
1595,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would her’s enjoy, there death should claim his rights."
1596,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,_He must be conquer’d that with many fights._
1597,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thou speak’st unfit things. To their labours then
1598,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Disperse these people; and let these two men,"
1599,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mentor and Halitherses, that so boast"
1600,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From the beginning to have govern’d most
1601,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In friendship of the father, to the son"
1602,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Confirm the course he now affects to run.
1603,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But my mind says, that, if he would but use"
1604,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A little patience, he should here hear news"
1605,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all things that his wish would understand,"
1606,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But no good hope for of the course in hand.”
1607,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, the Council rose; when ev’ry peer"
1608,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all the people in dispersion were
1609,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To houses of their own; the Wooers yet
1610,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Made to Ulysses’ house their old retreat.
1611,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Telemachus, apart from all the prease,"
1612,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Prepar’d to shore, and, in the aged seas"
1613,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His fair hands wash’d, did thus to Pallas pray:"
1614,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Hear me, O Goddess, that but yesterday"
1615,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Didst deign access to me at home, and lay"
1616,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Grave charge on me to take ship, and inquire"
1617,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Along the dark seas for mine absent sire!
1618,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which all the Greeks oppose; amongst whom most
1619,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Those that are proud still at another’s cost,"
1620,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Past measure, and the civil rights of men,"
1621,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My mother’s Wooers, my repulse maintain.”"
1622,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus spake he praying; when close to him came
1623,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pallas, resembling Mentor both in frame"
1624,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of voice and person, and advis’d him thus:"
1625,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Those Wooers well might know, Telemachus,"
1626,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou wilt not ever weak and childish be,"
1627,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,If to thee be instill’d the faculty
1628,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of mind and body that thy father grac’d;
1629,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And if, like him, there be in thee enchac’d"
1630,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Virtue to give words works, and works their end."
1631,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This voyage, that to them thou didst commend,"
1632,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall not so quickly, as they idly ween,"
1633,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Be vain, or giv’n up, for their opposite spleen."
1634,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, if Ulysses nor Penelope"
1635,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were thy true parents, I then hope in thee"
1636,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of no more urging thy attempt in hand;
1637,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For few, that rightly bred on both sides stand,"
1638,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Are like their parents, many that are worse,"
1639,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And most few better. Those then that the nurse
1640,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or mother call true-born yet are not so,"
1641,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Like worthy sires much less are like to grow.
1642,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But thou show’st now that in thee fades not quite
1643,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy father’s wisdom; and that future light
1644,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall therefore show thee far from being unwise,"
1645,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or touch’d with stain of bastard cowardice.
1646,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hope therefore says, that thou wilt to the end"
1647,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Pursue the brave act thou didst erst intend.
1648,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But for the foolish Wooers, they bewray"
1649,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They neither counsel have nor soul, since they"
1650,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Are neither wise nor just, and so must needs"
1651,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Rest ignorant how black above their heads
1652,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fate hovers holding Death, that one sole day"
1653,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Will make enough to make them all away.
1654,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For thee, the way thou wishest shall no more"
1655,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fly thee a step; I, that have been before"
1656,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy father’s friend, thine likewise now will be,"
1657,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Provide thy ship myself, and follow thee."
1658,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Go thou then home, and sooth each Wooer’s vein,"
1659,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But under hand fit all things for the main;
1660,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wine in as strong and sweet casks as you can,"
1661,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And meal, the very marrow of a man,"
1662,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which put in good sure leather sacks, and see"
1663,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That with sweet food sweet vessels still agree.
1664,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I from the people straight will press for you
1665,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Free voluntaries; and, for ships, enow"
1666,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sea-circled Ithaca contains, both new"
1667,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And old-built; all which I’ll exactly view,"
1668,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And choose what one soever most doth please;
1669,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which rigg’d, we’ll straight launch, and assay the seas.”"
1670,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This spake Jove’s daughter, Pallas; whose voice heard,"
1671,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No more Telemachus her charge deferr’d,"
1672,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But hasted home, and, sad at heart, did see"
1673,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amidst his hall th’ insulting Wooers flea
1674,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Goats, and roast swine. ’Mongst whom, Antinous"
1675,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Careless, discov’ring in Telemachus"
1676,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His grudge to see them, laugh’d, met, took his hand,"
1677,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said: “High-spoken, with the mind so mann’d!"
1678,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Come, do as we do, put not up your spirits"
1679,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With these low trifles, nor our loving merits"
1680,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In gall of any hateful purpose steep,"
1681,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But eat egregiously, and drink as deep."
1682,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The things thou think’st on, all at full shall be"
1683,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By th’ Achives thought on, and perform’d to thee;"
1684,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ship, and choice oars, that in a trice will land"
1685,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy hasty fleet on heav’nly Pylos’ sand,"
1686,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And at the fame of thy illustrious sire.”
1687,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He answer’d: “Men, whom pride did so inspire,"
1688,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Are not fit consorts for an humble guest;
1689,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor are constrain’d men merry at their feast.
1690,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is ’t not enough, that all this time ye have"
1691,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Op’d in your entrails my chief goods a grave,"
1692,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, while I was a child, made me partake?"
1693,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My now more growth more grown my mind doth make,"
1694,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, hearing speak more judging men than you,"
1695,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Perceive how much I was misgovern’d now.
1696,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I now will try if I can bring ye home
1697,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,An ill Fate to consort you; if it come
1698,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From Pylos, or amongst the people here."
1699,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But thither I resolve, and know that there"
1700,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I shall not touch in vain. Nor will I stay,"
1701,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Though in a merchant’s ship I steer my way;
1702,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which shows in your sights best; since me ye know
1703,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Incapable of ship, or men to row.”"
1704,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, his hand he coyly snatch’d away"
1705,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From forth Antinous’ hand. The rest the day
1706,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Spent through the house with banquets; some with jests,"
1707,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And some with railings, dignifying their feasts."
1708,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To whom a jest-proud youth the wit began:
1709,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“Telemachus will kill us ev’ry man.
1710,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From Sparta, to the very Pylian sand,"
1711,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He will raise aids to his impetuous hand.
1712,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,O he affects it strangely! Or he means
1713,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To search Ephyra’s fat shores, and from thence"
1714,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bring deathful poisons, which amongst our bowls"
1715,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Will make a general shipwrack of our souls.”
1716,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Another said: “Alas, who knows but he"
1717,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Once gone, and erring like his sire at sea,"
1718,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"May perish like him, far from aid of friends,"
1719,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And so he makes us work? For all the ends
1720,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Left of his goods here we shall share, the house"
1721,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Left to his mother and her chosen spouse.”
1722,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus they; while he a room ascended, high"
1723,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And large, built by his father, where did lie"
1724,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Gold and brass heap’d up, and in coffers were"
1725,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rich robes, great store of odorous oils, and there"
1726,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stood tuns of sweet old wines along the wall,"
1727,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Neat and divine drink, kept to cheer with all"
1728,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses’ old heart, if he turn’d again"
1729,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From labours fatal to him to sustain.
1730,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The doors of plank were, their close exquisite,"
1731,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Kept with a double key, and day and night"
1732,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A woman lock’d within; and that was she
1733,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who all trust had for her sufficiency,"
1734,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Old Euryclea, one of Opis’ race,"
1735,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Son to Pisenor, and in passing grace"
1736,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With grey Minerva; her the prince did call,"
1737,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And said: “Nurse! Draw me the most sweet of all
1738,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The wine thou keep’st; next that which for my sire
1739,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy care reserves, in hope he shall retire."
1740,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Twelve vessels fill me forth, and stop them well."
1741,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then into well-sew’d sacks of fine ground meal
1742,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pour twenty measures. Nor, to anyone"
1743,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But thee thyself, let this design be known."
1744,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All this see got together; I it all
1745,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In night will fetch off, when my mother shall"
1746,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ascend her high room, and for sleep prepare."
1747,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sparta and Pylos I must see, in care"
1748,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To find my father.” Out Euryclea cried,"
1749,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And ask’d with tears: “Why is your mind applied.
1750,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dear son, to this course? Whither will you go?"
1751,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So far off leave us, and belovéd so,"
1752,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So only? And the sole hope of your race?
1753,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Royal Ulysses, far from the embrace"

1756,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Wooers will with some deceit assay
1757,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To your destruction, making then their prey"
1758,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all your goods. Where, in your own y’are strong,"
1759,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Make sure abode. It fits not you so young
1760,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To suffer so much by the aged seas,"
1761,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And err in such a wayless wilderness.”
1762,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Be cheer’d, lov’d nurse,” said he, “for, not without"
1763,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The will of God, go my attempts about."
1764,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Swear therefore, not to wound my mother’s ears"
1765,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With word of this, before from heav’n appears"
1766,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Th’ elev’nth or twelfth light, or herself shall please"
1767,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To ask of me, or hears me put to seas,"
1768,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Lest her fair body with her woe be wore.”
1769,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To this the great oath of the Gods she swore;
1770,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which having sworn, and of it every due"
1771,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Perform’d to full, to vessels wine she drew,"
1772,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And into well-sew’d sacks pour’d foody meal.
1773,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In mean time he, with cunning to conceal"
1774,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All thought of this from others, himself bore"
1775,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In broad house, with the Wooers, as before."
1776,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then grey-eyed Pallas other thoughts did own,"
1777,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And like Telemachus trod through the town,"
1778,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Commanding all his men in th’ even to be
1779,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Aboard his ship. Again then question’d she
1780,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Noënon, fam’d for aged Phronius’ son,"
1781,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About his ship; who all things to be done
1782,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Assur’d her freely should. The sun then set,"
1783,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And sable shadows slid through ev’ry street,"
1784,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When forth they launch’d, and soon aboard did bring"
1785,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All arms, and choice of ev’ry needful thing"
1786,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That fits a well-rigg’d ship. The Goddess then
1787,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stood in the port’s extreme part, where her men,"
1788,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nobly appointed, thick about her came,"
1789,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whose ev’ry breast she did with spirit enflame.
1790,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Yet still fresh projects laid the grey-eyed Dame.
1791,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Straight to the house she hasted, and sweet sleep"
1792,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Pour’d on each Wooer; which so laid in steep
1793,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their drowsy temples, that each brow did nod,"
1794,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As all were drinking, and each hand his load,"
1795,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The cup, let fall. All start up, and to bed,"
1796,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor more would watch, when sleep so surfeited"
1797,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their leaden eye-lids. Then did Pallas call
1798,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Telemachus, in body, voice, and all,"
1799,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Resembling Mentor, from his native nest,"
1800,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said, that all his arm’d men were addrest"
1801,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To use their oars, and all expected now"
1802,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He should the spirit of a soldier show.
1803,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Come then,” said she, “no more let us defer"
1804,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our honour’d action.” Then she took on her
1805,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A ravish’d spirit, and led as she did leap;"
1806,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And he her most haste took out step by step.
1807,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Arrived at sea and ship, they found ashore"
1808,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The soldiers that their fashion’d-long hair wore;
1809,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To whom the prince said: “Come, my friends, let’s bring"
1810,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our voyage’s provision; ev’ry thing
1811,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is heap’d together in our court; and none,"
1812,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No not my mother, nor her maids, but one"
1813,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Knows our intention.” This express’d, he led,"
1814,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The soldiers close together followed;
1815,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all together brought aboard their store.
1816,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Aboard the prince went; Pallas still before
1817,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sat at the stern, he close to her, the men"
1818,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Up hasted after. He and Pallas then
1819,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Put from the shore. His soldiers then he bad
1820,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"See all their arms fit; which they heard, and had."
1821,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A beechen mast, then, in the hollow base"
1822,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They put, and hoisted, fix’d it in its place"
1823,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With cables; and with well-wreath’d halsers hoise
1824,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their white sails, which grey Pallas now employs"
1825,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With full and fore-gales through the dark deep main.
1826,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The purple waves, so swift cut, roar’d again"
1827,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against the ship sides, that now ran and plow’d"
1828,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The rugged seas up. Then the men bestow’d
1829,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their arms about the ship, and sacrifice"
1830,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With crown’d wine-cups to th’ endless Deities
1831,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They offer’d up. Of all yet thron’d above,"
1832,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They most observ’d the grey-eyed seed of Jove;
1833,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who, from the evening till the morning rose,"
1834,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all day long their voyage did dispose.

1905,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Come then, go right to Nestor; let us see,"
1906,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If in his bosom any counsel be,"
1907,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That may inform us. Pray him not to trace
1908,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The common courtship, and to speak in grace"
1909,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of the demander, but to tell the truth;"
1910,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which will delight him, and commend thy youth"
1911,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For such prevention; for he loves no lies,"
1912,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor will report them, being truly wise.”"
1913,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He answer’d: “Mentor! how, alas! shall I"

1915,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My youth by no means that ripe form affords,"

1923,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, she swiftly went before, and he"

1925,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When soon they reach’d the Pylian throngs and seats,"

1928,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Adherents dressing, all their sacred cheer,"
1929,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Being roast and boil’d meats. When the Pylians saw
1930,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These strangers come, in thrust did all men draw"
1931,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About their entry, took their hands, and pray’d"
1932,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They both would sit; their entry first assay’d
1933,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By Nestor’s son, Pisistratus. In grace"
1934,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of whose repair, he gave them honour’d place"
1935,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Betwixt his sire and brother Thrasymed,"

1938,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Parts of the inwards, and did make a stream"
1939,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of spritely wine into a golden bowl;

1943,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your travel hither makes ye partners now;
1944,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When, sacrificing as becomes, bestow"
1945,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This bowl of sweet wine on your friend, that he"
1946,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,May likewise use these rites of piety;
1947,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For I suppose his youth doth prayers use,"
1948,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since all men need the Gods. But you I choose
1949,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"First in this cup’s disposure, since his years"
1950,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Seem short of yours, who more like me appears.”"
1951,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus gave he her the cup of pleasant wine;
1952,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And since a wise and just man did design
1953,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The golden bowl first to her free receit,"
1954,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n to the Goddess it did add delight,"
1955,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who thus invok’d: “Hear thou, whose vast embrace"

1957,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To us that ask it in performing this:

1959,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Vouchsafe all honour; and, next them, bestow"
1960,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On all these Pylians, that have offer’d now"
1961,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This most renowned hecatomb to thee,"
1962,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Remuneration fit for them, and free;"

1964,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The work perform’d for whose effect we came,"
1965,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our safe return, both with our ship and fame.”"
1966,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus pray’d she; and herself herself obey’d,"
1967,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In th’ end performing all for which she pray’d.
1968,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And now, to pray, and do as she had done,"
1969,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,She gave the fair round bowl t’ Ulysses’ son.
1970,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The meat then dress’d, and drawn, and serv’d t’ each guest,"
1971,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They celebrated a most sumptuous feast.
1972,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When appetite to wine and food allay’d,"
1973,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Horse-taming Nestor then began, and said:"
1974,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Now life’s desire is serv’d, as far as fare,"
1975,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Time fits me to enquire what guests these are.
1976,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fair guests, what are ye? And for what coast tries"
1977,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your ship the moist deeps? For fit merchandise?
1978,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or rudely coast ye, like our men of prise,"
1979,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The rough seas tempting, desperately erring,"
1980,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The ill of others in their good conferring?”
1981,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The wise prince now his boldness did begin,"
1982,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For Pallas’ self had harden’d him within,"
1983,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By this device of travel to explore
1984,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His absent father; which two girlonds wore;
1985,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His good by manage of his spirits; and then
1986,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To gain him high grace in th’ accounts of men.

1992,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His haughty forehead, and the honour bears"
1993,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To be our sea-mark) we assay’d the waves.
1994,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The business, I must tell, our own good craves,"
1995,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And not the public. I am come t’ enquire,"
1996,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If, in the fame that best men doth inspire"
1997,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of my most-suff’ring father, I may hear"
1998,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some truth of his estate now, who did bear"
1999,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The name, being join’d in fight with you alone,"
2000,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To even with earth the height of Ilion.
2001,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all men else, that any name did bear,"
2002,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And fought for Troy, the sev’ral ends we hear;"
2003,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But his death Jove keeps from the world unknown,"
2004,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The certain fame thereof being told by none;
2005,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If on the continent by enemies slain,"
2006,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or with the waves eat of the ravenous main.
2007,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For his love ’tis that to your knees I sue,"
2008,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That you would please, out of your own clear view,"
2009,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"T’ assure his sad end; or say, if your ear"
2010,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hath heard of the unhappy wanderer,"
2011,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To too much sorrow whom his mother bore.
2012,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You then by all your bounties I implore,"
2013,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(If ever to you deed or word hath stood,"
2014,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By my good father promis’d, render’d good"
2015,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the Trojans, where ye both have tried"
2016,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Grecian suff’rance) that in nought applied
2017,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To my respect or pity you will glose,"
2018,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But uncloth’d truth to my desires disclose.”
2019,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O my much-lov’d,” said he, “since you renew"
2020,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Remembrance of the miseries that grew
2021,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Upon our still-in-strength-opposing Greece
2022,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst Troy’s people, I must touch a piece"
2023,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all our woes there, either in the men"
2024,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Achilles brought by sea and led to gain
2025,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About the country, or in us that fought"
2026,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About the city, where to death were brought"
2027,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All our chief men, as many as were there."
2028,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,There Mars-like Ajax lies; Achilles there;

2031,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Past measure swift of foot, and staid in fight."
2032,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A number more that ills felt infinite;
2033,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of which to reckon all, what mortal man,"
2034,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If five or six years you should stay here, can"
2035,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Serve such enquiry? You would back again,"
2036,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Affected with unsufferable pain,"
2037,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before you heard it. Nine years sieg’d we them,"
2038,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With all the depth and sleight of stratagem
2039,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That could be thought. Ill knit to ill past end.
2040,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Yet still they toil’d us; nor would yet Jove send
2041,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rest to our labours, nor will scarcely yet."
2042,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But no man liv’d, that would in public set"
2043,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His wisdom by Ulysses’ policy,"
2044,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As thought his equal; so excessively
2045,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He stood superior all ways. If you be
2046,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His son indeed, mine eyes ev’n ravish me"
2047,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To admiration. And in all consent
2048,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your speech puts on his speech’s ornament.
2049,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor would one say, that one so young could use,"
2050,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Unless his son, a rhetoric so profuse."
2051,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And while we liv’d together, he and I"

2055,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Greeks at all hours, that, with fairest course,"
2056,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What best became them, they might put in force."
2057,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But when Troy’s’ high tow’rs we had levell’d thus,"
2058,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We put to sea, and God divided us."
2059,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And then did Jove our sad retreat devise;
2060,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For all the Greeks were neither just nor wise,"
2061,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore many felt so sharp a fate,"
2062,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Sent from Minerva’s most pernicious hate;
2063,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whose mighty Father can do fearful things.
2064,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By whose help she betwixt the brother kings
2065,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Let fall contention; who in council met
2066,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In vain, and timeless, when the sun was set,"
2067,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all the Greeks call’d, that came charg’d with wine."
2068,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet then the kings would utter their design,"
2069,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And why they summon’d. Menelaus, he"
2070,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Put all in mind of home, and cried, To sea."
2071,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But Agamemnon stood on contraries,"
2072,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose will was, they should stay and sacrifice"
2073,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whole hecatombs to Pallas, to forego"
2074,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her high wrath to them. Fool! that did not know
2075,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,She would not so be won; for not with ease
2076,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Th’ Eternal Gods are turn’d from what they please.
2077,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So they, divided, on foul language stood."
2078,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Greeks in huge rout rose, their wine-heat blood"
2079,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Two ways affecting. And, that night’s sleep too,"
2080,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,We turn’d to studying either other’s woe;
2081,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When Jove besides made ready woes enow.
2082,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Morn came, we launch’d, and in our ships did stow"
2083,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our goods, and fair-girt women. Half our men"
2084,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The people’s guide, Atrides, did contain,"
2085,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And half, being now aboard, put forth to sea."
2086,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A most free gale gave all ships prosp’rous way.
2087,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"God settled then the huge whale-bearing lake,"
2088,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Tenedos we reach’d; where, for time’s sake,"
2089,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We did divine rites to the Gods. But Jove,"
2090,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Inexorable still, bore yet no love"
2091,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To our return, but did again excite"
2092,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A second sad contention, that turn’d quite"
2093,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A great part of us back to sea again;
2094,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which were th’ abundant-in-all-counsels man,"
2095,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your matchless father, who, to gratify"
2096,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The great Atrides, back to him did fly."
2097,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But I fled all, with all that follow’d me,"
2098,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Because I knew God studied misery,"
2099,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To hurl amongst us. With me likewise fled
2100,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Martial Tydides. I the men he led
2101,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Gat to go with him. Winds our fleet did bring
2102,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Lesbos, where the yellow-headed king,"
2103,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though late, yet found us, as we put to choice"
2104,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A tedious voyage; if we sail should hoise
2105,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Above rough Chius, left on our left hand,"
2106,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To th’ isle of Psyria, or that rugged land"
2107,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sail under, and for windy Mimas steer."
2108,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,We ask’d of God that some ostent might clear
2109,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our cloudy business, who gave us sign,"
2110,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And charge, that all should, in a middle line,"
2111,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sea cut for Eubœa, that with speed"

2123,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since God fore-sent it first. And thus I came,"
2124,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dear son, to Pylos, uninform’d by fame,"
2125,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor know one sav’d by Fate, or overcome."
2126,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom I have heard of since, set here at home,"

2139,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Atrides leaving a good son, that dyed,"
2140,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In blood of that deceitful parricide,"

2147,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Orestes made that wreak his master-piece,"
2148,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And him the Greeks will give a master-praise,"

2151,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With his performance, that my injury,"
2152,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Done by my mother’s Wooers, being so foul,"

2154,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who, pressing me with contumelies, dare"
2155,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Such things as past the pow’r of utt’rance are.
2156,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But Heav’n’s great Pow’rs have grac’d my destiny
2157,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With no such honour. Both my sire and I

2162,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The ills thou nam’st. But say: Proceedeth it
2163,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From will in thee to bear so foul a foil?
2164,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or from thy subjects’ hate, that wish thy spoil,"
2165,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And will not aid thee, since their spirits rely,"

2179,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As did thy father, ev’ry man of these"
2180,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Would lose in death their seeking marriages.”
2181,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O father,” answer’d he, “you make amaze"

2212,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Instruction of grave Nestor, since he flows"
2213,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Past shore in all experience, and knows"

2223,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That false Ægisthus, being so far unfit"
2224,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A match for him, could his death so enforce?"
2225,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was he not then in Argos? or his course

2238,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To ev’ry sinew’s sufferance, while he"

2240,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And Agamemnon’s wife with force of word
2241,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Flatter’d and soften’d, who, at first, abhorr’d"
2242,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A fact so infamous. The heav’nly dame
2243,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A good mind had, but was in blood to blame."
2244,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There was a poet, to whose care the king"
2245,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His queen committed, and in ev’ry thing,"
2246,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When he from Troy went, charg’d him to apply"

2248,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But when strong Fate so wrapt-in her effects,"
2249,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That she resolv’d to leave her fit respects,"
2250,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Into a desert isle her guardian led,"
2251,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There left, the rapine of the vultures fed."
2252,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then brought he willing home his will’s won prize,"

2272,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To give his friend the earth, being his pursuit,"
2273,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all his exequies to execute.
2274,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But sailing still the wine-hued seas,[2] to reach"
2275,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some shore for fit performance, he did fetch"
2276,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The steep mount of the Malians, and there,"
2277,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With open voice, offended Jupiter"
2278,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Proclaim’d the voyage his repugnant mind,"
2279,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And pour’d the puffs out of a shrieking wind,"
2280,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That nourish’d billows heighten’d like to hills;
2281,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And with the fleet’s division fulfills
2282,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His hate proclaim’d; upon a part of Crete
2283,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Casting the navy, where the sea-waves meet"
2284,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rough Jardanus, and where the Cydons live."
2285,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There is a rock, on which the sea doth drive,"
2286,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bare, and all broken, on the confines set"
2287,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Gortys, that the dark seas likewise fret;"
2288,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And hither sent the South a horrid drift
2289,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of waves against the top, that was the left"
2290,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of that torn cliff as far as Phæstus’ strand.
2291,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A little stone the great sea’s rage did stand.
2292,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The men here driv’n ‘scap’d hard the ship’s sore shocks,"
2293,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The ships themselves being wrack’d against the rocks,"
2294,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Save only five, that blue fore-castles bore,"
2295,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which wind and water cast on Egypt’s shore.
2296,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When he (there victling well, and store of gold"
2297,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Aboard his ships brought) his wild way did hold,"
2298,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And t’ other languag’d men was forc’d to roam.
2299,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mean space Ægisthus made sad work at home,"
2300,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And slew his brother, forcing to his sway"
2301,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Atrides’ subjects, and did sev’n years lay"
2302,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His yoke upon the rich Mycenian state.
2303,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But in the eighth, to his affrighting fate,"
2304,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Divine Orestes home from Athens came,"
2305,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And what his royal father felt, the same"
2306,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He made the false Ægisthus groan beneath.
2307,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,_Death evermore is the reward of death._
2308,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus having slain him, a sepulchral feast"

2311,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The self-same day upon him stole the king
2312,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Good-at-a-martial-shout, and goods did bring,"
2313,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As many as his freighted fleet could bear.
2314,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But thou, my son, too long by no means err,"
2315,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy goods left free for many a spoilful guest,"
2316,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lest they consume some, and divide the rest,"
2317,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thou, perhaps, besides, thy voyage lose."
2318,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To Menelaus yet thy course dispose
2319,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I wish and charge thee; who but late arriv’d
2320,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From such a shore and men, as to have liv’d"
2321,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In a return from them he never thought,"
2322,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And whom black whirlwinds violently brought
2323,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Within a sea so vast, that in a year"
2324,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not any fowl could pass it anywhere,"
2325,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So huge and horrid was it. But go thou
2326,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With ship and men (or, if thou pleasest now"
2327,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To pass by land, there shall be brought for thee"
2328,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both horse and chariot, and thy guides shall be"
2329,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My sons themselves) to Sparta the divine,"
2330,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And to the king whose locks like amber shine.
2331,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Intreat the truth of him, nor loves he lies,"
2332,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wisdom in truth is, and he’s passing wise.”"
2333,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, the Sun went down, and up rose Night,"
2334,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When Pallas spake: “O father, all good right"
2335,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Bear thy directions. But divide we now

2349,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He, mov’d with that, provok’d thus their abodes:"
2350,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Now Jove forbid, and all the long-liv’d Gods,"
2351,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your leaving me, to sleep aboard a ship;"
2352,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As I had drunk of poor Penia’s whip,"
2353,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Even to my nakedness, and had nor sheet"
2354,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor cov’ring in my house; that warm nor sweet
2355,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A guest, nor I myself, had means to sleep;"
2356,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where I, both weeds and wealthy cov’rings keep"

2363,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“My much-lov’d father,” said Minerva, “well"
2364,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All this becomes thee. But persuade to dwell
2365,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This night with thee thy son Telemachus,"
2366,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For more convenient is the course for us,"
2367,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That he may follow to thy house and rest,"
2368,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And I may board our black-sail, that addrest"
2369,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At all parts I may make our men, and cheer"
2370,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All with my presence, since of all men there"

2374,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In fresh similitude of form and years.
2375,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For their confirmance, I will therefore now"
2376,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sleep in our black bark. But, when light shall show"

2382,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ablest in strength, and of the speediest course”"
2383,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, away she flew, form’d like the fowl"
2384,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Men call the ossifrage; when ev’ry soul
2385,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amaze invaded; even th’ old man admir’d,"
2386,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The youth’s hand took, and said: “O most desir’d,"
2387,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My hope says thy proof will no coward show,"

2392,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The great-in-prey, that did in honour move"
2393,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So much about thy father, amongst all"
2394,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Grecian army. Fairest queen, let fall"
2395,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,On me like favours! Give me good renown!
2396,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which, as on me, on my lov’d wife let down,"
2397,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all my children. I will burn to thee
2398,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"An ox right bred, broad-headed, and yoke-free,"
2399,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To no man’s hand yet humbled. Him will I,"
2400,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His horns in gold hid, give thy Deity.”"
2401,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus pray’d he, and she heard; and home he led"
2402,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His sons, and all his heaps of kindered."
2403,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who ent’ring his court royal, ev’ry one"
2404,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He marshall’d in his sev’ral seat and throne;
2405,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ev’ry one, so kindly come, he gave"
2406,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His sweet-wine cup; which none was let to have
2407,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Before his ‘leventh year landed him from Troy;

2409,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who therefore pierc’d it, and did give it vent."
2410,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of this the old duke did a cup present
2411,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To ev’ry guest; made his Maid many a pray’r
2412,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That wears the shield fring’d with his nurse’s hair,"
2413,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And gave her sacrifice. With this rich wine
2414,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And food suffic’d, sleep all eyes did decline,"

2418,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A bed, all chequer’d with elaborate art,"
2419,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Within a portico that rung like brass,"

2422,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That liv’d, of all his sons, unwed till then."
2423,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Himself lay in a by-room, far above,"
2424,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His bed made by his barren wife, his love."
2425,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The rosy-finger’d Morn no sooner shone,"
2426,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But up he rose, took air, and sat upon"
2427,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A seat of white and goodly polish’d stone,"
2428,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That such a gloss as richest ointments wore,"
2429,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Before his high gates; where the counsellor
2430,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That match’d the Gods (his father) us’d to sit,"
2431,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who now, by fate forc’d, stoop’d as low as it."
2432,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And here sat Nestor, holding in his hand"
2433,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A sceptre; and about him round did stand,"
2434,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As early up, his sons’ troop; Perseus,"
2435,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The god-like Thrasymed, and Aretus,"
2436,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Echephron, Stratius, and sixth and last"
2437,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pisistratus, and by him (half embrac’d"
2438,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Still as they came) divine Telemachus;

2452,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The maids within, that they prepare a feast,"
2453,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Set seats through all the court, see straight addrest"

2520,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was Nestor by his sons, who straight prepar’d"
2521,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both horse and chariot. She that kept the store,"
2522,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both bread and wine, and all such viands more,"
2523,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As should the feast of Jove-fed kings compose,"

2818,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My vow had bound me; whither bringing then
2819,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His riches, and his son, and all his men,"
2820,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From barren Ithaca, (some one sole town"
2821,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Inhabited about him batter’d down)
2822,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All should in Argos live. And there would I
2823,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ease him of rule, and take the empery"
2824,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all on me. And often here would we,"
2825,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Delighting, loving either’s company,"
2826,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Meet and converse; whom nothing should divide,"
2827,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Till death’s black veil did each all over hide.
2828,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But this perhaps hath been a mean to take
2829,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ev’n God himself with envy; who did make
2830,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses therefore only the unblest,"
2831,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That should not reach his loved country’s rest.”
2832,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
2833,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,These woes made ev’ry one with woe in love;
2834,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n Argive Helen wept, the Seed of Jove;"
2835,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ulysses’ son wept; Atreus’ son did weep;
2836,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Nestor’s son his eyes in tears did steep,"
2837,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But his tears fell not from the present cloud
2838,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That from Ulysses was exhal’d, but flow’d"
2839,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From brave Antilochus’ remember’d due,"
2840,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom the renown’d Son of the Morning slew,"
2841,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which yet he thus excus’d: “O Atreus’ son!
2842,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Old Nestor says, there lives not such a one"
2843,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amongst all mortals as Atrides is
2844,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For deathless wisdom. ’Tis a praise of his,"
2845,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Still giv’n in your remembrance, when at home"
2846,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our speech concerns you. Since then overcome
2847,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You please to be with sorrow, ev’n to tears,"
2848,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That are in wisdom so exempt from peers,"
2849,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Vouchsafe the like effect in me excuse,"
2850,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If it be lawful, I affect no use"
2851,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of tears thus after meals; at least, at night;"
2852,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But when the morn brings forth, with tears, her light,"
2853,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It shall not then impair me to bestow
2854,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My tears on any worthy’s overthrow.
2855,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It is the only rite that wretched men
2856,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Can do dead friends, to cut hair, and complain."
2857,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But Death my brother took, whom none could call"
2858,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Grecian coward, you best knew of all."
2859,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I was not there, nor saw, but men report"
2860,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Antilochus excell’d the common sort
2861,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For footmanship, or for the chariot race,"
2862,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or in the fight for hardy hold of place.”
2863,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
2864,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O friend,” said he, “since thou hast spoken so,"
2865,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At all parts as one wise should say and do,"
2866,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And like one far beyond thyself in years,"
2867,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy words shall bounds be to our former tears.
2868,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O he is questionless a right-born son,"
2869,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That of his father hath not only won
2870,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The person but the wisdom; and that sire
2871,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Complete himself that hath a son entire,"
2872,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove did not only his full fate adorn,"
2873,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When he was wedded, but when he was born."
2874,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As now Saturnius, through his life’s whole date,"
2875,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hath Nestor’s bliss rais’d to as steep a state,"
2876,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both in his age to keep in peace his house,"
2877,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And to have children wise and valorous.
2878,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But let us not forget our rear feast thus.
2879,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Let some give water here. Telemachus!
2880,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The morning shall yield time to you and me
2881,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To do what fits, and reason mutually.”"
2882,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
2883,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, the careful servant of the king,"
2884,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Asphalion, pour’d on th’ issue of the spring;"
2885,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all to ready feast set ready hand.
2886,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But Helen now on new device did stand,"
2887,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Infusing straight a medicine to their wine,"
2888,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, drowning care and angers; did decline"
2889,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All thought of ill. Who drunk her cup could shed
2890,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All that day not a tear, no not if dead"
2891,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That day his father or his mother were,"
2892,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not if his brother, child, or chiefest dear,"
2893,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He should see murder’d then before his face.
2894,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Such useful medicines, only borne in grace"
2895,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of what was good, would Helen ever have."
2896,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And this juice to her Polydamna gave
2897,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The wife of Thoon, an Ægyptian born,"
2898,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whose rich earth herbs of medicine do adorn
2899,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In great abundance. Many healthful are,"
2900,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And many baneful. Ev’ry man is there
2901,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A good physician out of Nature’s grace,"
2902,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For all the nation sprung of Pæon’s race.
2903,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
2904,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When Helen then her medicine had infus’d,"
2905,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She bad pour wine to it, and this speech us’d:"
2906,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
2907,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Atrides, and these good men’s sons, great Jove"
2908,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Makes good and ill one after other move,"
2909,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In all things earthly; for he can do all.
2910,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The woes past, therefore, he so late let fall,"
2911,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The comforts he affords us let us take;
2912,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Feast, and, with fit discourses, merry make."
2913,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor will I other use. As then our blood
2914,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Griev’d for Ulysses, since he was so good,"
2915,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since he was good, let us delight to hear"
2916,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"How good he was, and what his suff’rings were;"
2917,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though ev’ry fight, and ev’ry suff’ring deed,"
2918,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Patient Ulysses underwent, exceed"
2919,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My woman’s pow’r to number, or to name."
2920,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But what he did, and suffer’d, when he came"
2921,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the Trojans, where ye Grecians all"
2922,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Took part with suff’rance, I in part can call"
2923,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To your kind memories. How with ghastly wounds
2924,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Himself he mangled, and the Trojan bounds,"
2925,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thrust thick with enemies, adventur’d on,"
2926,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His royal shoulders having cast upon
2927,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Base abject weeds, and enter’d like a slave."
2928,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then, beggar-like, he did of all men crave,"
2929,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And such a wretch was, as the whole Greek fleet"
2930,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Brought not besides. And thus through ev’ry street
2931,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He crept discov’ring, of no one man known."
2932,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yet through all this diff’rence, I alone"
2933,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Smoked his true person, talk’d with him; but he"
2934,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fled me with wiles still. Nor could we agree,"
2935,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Till I disclaim’d him quite; and so (as mov’d
2936,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With womanly remorse of one that prov’d
2937,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So wretched an estate, whate’er he were)"
2938,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Won him to take my house. And yet ev’n there,"
2939,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Till freely I, to make him doubtless, swore"
2940,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A pow’rful oath, to let him reach the shore"
2941,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of ships and tents before Troy understood,"
2942,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I could not force on him his proper good.
2943,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But then I bath’d and sooth’d him, and he then"
2944,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Confess’d, and told me all; and, having slain"
2945,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A number of the Trojan guards, retir’d,"
2946,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And reach’d the fleet, for sleight and force admir’d."
2947,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their husbands’ deaths by him the Trojan wives
2948,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shriek’d for; but I made triumphs for their lives,"
2949,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For then my heart conceiv’d, that once again"
2950,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I should reach home; and yet did still retain
2951,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Woe for the slaughters Venus made for me,"
2952,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When both my husband, my Hermione,"
2953,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And bridal room, she robb’d of so much right,"
2954,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And drew me from my country with her sleight,"
2955,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though nothing under heaven I here did need,"
2956,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That could my fancy or my beauty feed.”
2957,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
2958,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her husband said: “Wife! what you please to tell
2959,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is true at all parts, and becomes you well;"
2960,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And I myself, that now may say have seen"
2961,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The minds and manners of a world of men,"
2962,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And great heroes, measuring many a ground,"
2963,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Have never, by these eyes that light me, found"
2964,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One with a bosom so to be belov’d,"
2965,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As that in which th’ accomplish’d spirit mov’d
2966,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of patient Ulysses. What, brave man,"
2967,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He both did act, and suffer, when he wan"
2968,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The town of Ilion, in the brave-built horse,"
2969,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When all we chief states of the Grecian force
2970,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were hous’d together, bringing death and Fate"
2971,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the Trojans, you, wife, may relate;"
2972,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For you, at last, came to us; God, that would"
2973,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Trojans’ glory give, gave charge you should"
2974,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Approach the engine; and Deiphobus,"
2975,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The god-like, follow’d. Thrice ye circled us"
2976,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With full survey of it; and often tried
2977,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The hollow crafts that in it were implied.[4]
2978,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When all the voices of their wives in it
2979,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You took on you with voice so like and fit,"
2980,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ev’ry man by name so visited,"
2981,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That I, Ulysses, the king Diomed,"
2982,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Set in the midst, and hearing how you call’d)"
2983,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tydides, and myself (as half appall’d"
2984,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With your remorseful plaints) would passing fain
2985,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Have broke our silence, rather than again"
2986,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Endure, respectless, their so moving cries."
2987,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But Ithacus our strongest phantasies
2988,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Contain’d within us from the slenderest noise,"
2989,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And ev’ry man there sat without a voice.
2990,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Anticlus only would have answer’d thee,"
2991,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But his speech Ithacus incessantly
2992,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With strong hand held in, till, Minerva’s call"
2993,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Charging thee off, Ulysses sav’d us all.”"
2994,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
2995,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Telemachus replied: “Much greater is
2996,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My grief, for hearing this high praise of his."
2997,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For all this doth not his sad death divert,"
2998,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor can, though in him swell’d an iron heart."
2999,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Prepare, and lead then, if you please, to rest:"
3000,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sleep, that we hear not, will content us best.”"
3001,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then Argive Helen made her handmaid go,"
3002,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And put fair bedding in the portico,"
3003,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lay purple blankets on, rugs warm and soft,"
3004,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And cast an arras coverlet aloft.
3005,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
3006,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They torches took, made haste, and made the bed;"
3007,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When both the guests were to their lodgings led
3008,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Within a portico without the house.
3009,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Atrides, and his large-train-wearing spouse,"
3010,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The excellent of women, for the way,"
3011,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In a retir’d receit, together lay."
3012,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Morn arose; the king rose, and put on"
3013,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His royal weeds, his sharp sword hung upon"
3014,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His ample shoulders, forth his chamber went,"
3015,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And did the person of a God present.
3016,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
3017,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Telemachus accosts him, who begun"
3018,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Speech of his journey’s proposition:
3019,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
3020,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“And what, my young Ulyssean heroë,"
3021,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Provok’d thee on the broad back of the sea,"
3022,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To visit Lacedæmon the divine?
3023,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Speak truth, some public [good] or only thine?”"
3024,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
3025,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“I come,” said he, “to hear, if any fame"
3026,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Breath’d of my father to thy notice came.
3027,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My house is sack’d, my fat works of the field"
3028,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Are all destroy’d; my house doth nothing yield
3029,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But enemies, that kill my harmless sheep,"
3030,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And sinewy oxen, nor will ever keep"
3031,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their steels without them. And these men are they
3032,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That woo my mother, most inhumanly"
3033,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Committing injury on injury.
3034,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To thy knees therefore I am come, t’ attend"
3035,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Relation of the sad and wretched end
3036,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My erring father felt, if witness’d by"
3037,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your own eyes, or the certain news that fly"
3038,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From others’ knowledges. For, more than is"
3039,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The usual heap of human miseries,"
3040,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His mother bore him to. Vouchsafe me then,"
3041,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Without all ruth of what I can sustain,"
3042,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The plain and simple truth of all you know.
3043,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let me beseech so much, if ever vow"
3044,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was made, and put in good effect to you,"
3045,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At Troy, where suff’rance bred you so much smart,"
3046,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon my father good Ulysses’ part,"
3047,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And quit it now to me (himself in youth)
3048,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Unfolding only the uncloséd truth.”
3049,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
3050,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He, deeply sighing, answer’d him: “O shame,"
3051,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That such poor vassals should affect the fame
3052,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To share the joys of such a worthy’s bed!
3053,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As when a hind, her calves late farrowéd,"
3054,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To give suck, enters the bold lion’s den,"
3055,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He roots of hills and herby vallies then
3056,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For food (there feeding) hunting; but at length
3057,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Returning to his cavern, gives his strength"
3058,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The lives of both the mother and her brood
3059,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In deaths indecent; so the Wooers’ blood
3060,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Must pay Ulysses’ pow’rs as sharp an end.
3061,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O would to Jove, Apollo, and thy friend"
3062,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The wise Minerva, that thy father were"
3063,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As once he was, when he his spirits did rear"
3064,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against Philomelides, in a fight"
3065,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Perform’d in well-built Lesbos, where, down-right"
3066,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He strook the earth with him, and gat a shout"
3067,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the Grecians! O, if now full out"
3068,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He were as then, and with the Wooers coped,"
3069,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Short-liv’d they all were, and their nuptials hoped"
3070,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would prove as desp’rate. But, for thy demand"
3071,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Enforc’d with pray’rs, I’ll let thee understand"
3072,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The truth directly, nor decline a thought,"
3073,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Much less deceive, or sooth thy search in ought;"
3074,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But what the old and still-true-spoken God,"
3075,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That from the sea breathes oracles abroad,"
3076,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Disclos’d to me, to thee I’ll all impart,"
3077,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor hide one word from thy sollicitous heart.
3078,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
3079,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I was in Ægypt, where a mighty time"
3080,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Gods detain’d me, though my natural clime"
3081,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I never so desir’d, because their homes"
3082,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I did not greet with perfect hecatombs.
3083,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For they will put men evermore in mind,"
3084,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,How much their masterly commandments bind.
3085,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
3086,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There is, besides, a certain island, call’d"
3087,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pharos, that with the high-wav’d sea is wall’d,"
3088,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Just against Ægypt, and so much remote,"
3089,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As in a whole day, with a fore-gale smote,"
3090,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A hollow ship can sail. And this isle bears
3091,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A port most portly, where sea-passengers"
3092,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Put in still for fresh water, and away"
3093,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To sea again. Yet here the Gods did stay
3094,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My fleet full twenty days; the winds, that are"
3095,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Masters at sea, no prosp’rous puff would spare"
3096,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To put us off; and all my victuals here
3097,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had quite corrupted, as my men’s minds were,"
3098,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had not a certain Goddess giv’n regard,"
3099,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And pitied me in an estate so hard;
3100,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ’twas Idothea, honour’d Proteus’ seed,"
3101,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That old sea-farer. Her mind I make bleed
3102,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With my compassion, when (walk’d all alone,"
3103,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From all my soldiers, that were ever gone"
3104,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About the isle on fishing with hooks bent;
3105,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Hunger their bellies on her errand sent)
3106,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She came close to me, spake, and thus began:"
3107,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
3108,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,‘Of all men thou art the most foolish man!
3109,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or slack in business, or stay’st here of choice,"
3110,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And dost in all thy suff’rances rejoice,"
3111,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That thus long liv’st detain’d here, and no end"
3112,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Canst give thy tarriance? Thou dost much offend
3113,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The minds of all thy fellows.’ I replied:
3114,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
3115,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘Whoever thou art of the Deified,"
3116,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I must affirm, that no way with my will"
3117,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I make abode here; but, it seems, some ill"
3118,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Gods, inhabiting broad heav’n, sustain"
3119,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against my getting off. Inform me then,"
3120,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For Godheads all things know, what God is he"
3121,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That stays my passage from the fishy sea?’
3122,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
3123,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘Stranger,’ said she, ‘I’ll tell thee true: There lives"
3124,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"An old sea-farer in these seas, that gives"
3125,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A true solution of all secrets here,"
3126,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who deathless Proteus is, th’ Ægyptian peer,"
3127,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who can the deeps of all the seas exquire,"
3128,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who Neptune’s priest is, and, they say, the sire"
3129,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That did beget me. Him, if any way"
3130,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou couldst inveigle, he would clear display"
3131,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy course from hence, and how far off doth lie"
3132,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy voyage’s whole scope through Neptune’s sky.
3133,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Informing thee, O God-preserv’d, beside,"
3134,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If thy desires would so be satisfied,"
3135,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whatever good or ill hath got event,"
3136,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all the time thy long and hard course spent,"
3137,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since thy departure from thy house.’ This said;
3138,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Again I answer’d: ‘Make the sleights display’d
3139,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy father useth, lest his foresight see,"
3140,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or his foreknowledge taking note of me,"
3141,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He flies the fixt place of his us’d abode.
3142,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,’Tis hard for man to countermine with God.’
3143,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
3144,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,She straight replied: ‘I’ll utter truth in all:
3145,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When heav’n’s supremest height the sun doth skall,"
3146,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The old Sea-tell-truth leaves the deeps, and hides"
3147,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amidst a black storm, when the West Wind chides,"
3148,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In caves still sleeping. Round about him sleep
3149,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(With short feet swimming forth the foamy deep)
3150,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sea-calves, lovely Halosydnes call’d,"
3151,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From whom a noisome odour is exhal’d,"
3152,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Got from the whirl-pools, on whose earth they lie."
3153,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Here, when the morn illustrates all the sky,"
3154,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I’ll guide, and seat thee in the fittest place"
3155,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For the performance thou hast now in chace.
3156,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In mean time, reach thy fleet, and choose out three"
3157,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of best exploit, to go as aids to thee."
3158,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
3159,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But now I’ll show thee all the old God’s sleights:
3160,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He first will number, and take all the sights"
3161,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of those his guard, that on the shore arrives."
3162,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When having view’d, and told them forth by fives,"
3163,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He takes place in their midst, and there doth sleep,"
3164,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Like to a shepherd midst his flock of sheep.
3165,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his first sleep, call up your hardiest cheer,"
3166,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Vigour and violence, and hold him there,"
3167,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In spite of all his strivings to be gone.
3168,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He then will turn himself to ev’ry one
3169,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all things that in earth creep and respire,"
3170,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In water swim, or shine in heav’nly fire."
3171,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet still hold you him firm, and much the more"
3172,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Press him from passing. But when, as before,"
3173,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When sleep first bound his pow’rs, his form ye see,"
3174,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then cease your force, and th’ old heroë free,"
3175,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then demand, which heav’n-born it may be"
3176,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That so afflicts you, hind’ring your retreat,"
3177,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And free sea-passage to your native seat.’
3178,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
3179,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, she div’d into the wavy seas,"
3180,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And I my course did to my ships address,"
3181,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That on the sands stuck; where arriv’d, we made"
3182,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our supper ready. Then th’ ambrosian shade
3183,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of night fell on us, and to sleep we fell."
3184,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rosy Aurora rose; we rose as well,"
3185,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And three of them on whom I most relied,"
3186,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For firm at ev’ry force, I choos’d, and hied"
3187,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Straight to the many-river-servéd seas;
3188,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all assistance ask’d the Deities.
3189,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
3190,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Mean time Idothea the sea’s broad breast
3191,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Embrac’d, and brought for me, and all my rest,"
3192,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Four of the sea-calves’ skins but newly flay’d,"
3193,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To work a wile which she had fashionéd
3194,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon her father. Then, within the sand"
3195,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A covert digging, when these calves should land,"
3196,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,She sat expecting. We came close to her;
3197,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She plac’d us orderly, and made us wear"
3198,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Each one his calf’s skin. But we then must pass
3199,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A huge exploit. The sea-calves’ savour was
3200,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So passing sour, they still being bred at seas,"
3201,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It much afflicted us; for who can please
3202,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To lie by one of these same sea-bred whales?
3203,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But she preserves us, and to memory calls"
3204,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A rare commodity; she fetch’d to us
3205,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ambrosia, that an air most odorous"
3206,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bears still about it, which she ‘nointed round"
3207,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our either nosthrils, and in it quite drown’d"
3208,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The nasty whale-smell. Then the great event
3209,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The whole morn’s date, with spirits patient,"
3210,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We lay expecting. When bright noon did flame,"
3211,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Forth from the sea in shoals the sea-calves came,"
3212,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And orderly, at last lay down and slept"
3213,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Along the sands. And then th’ old Sea-God crept
3214,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From forth the deeps, and found his fat calves there,"
3215,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Survey’d, and number’d, and came never near"
3216,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The craft we us’d, but told us five for calves."
3217,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His temples then dis-eas’d with sleep he salves;
3218,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And in rush’d we, with an abhorréd cry,"
3219,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Cast all our hands about him manfully;
3220,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And then th’ old Forger all his forms began:
3221,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"First was a lion with a mighty mane,"
3222,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then next a dragon, a pied panther then,"
3223,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A vast boar next, and suddenly did strain"
3224,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All into water. Last he was a tree,"
3225,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Curl’d all at top, and shot up to the sky."
3226,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
3227,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We, with resolv’d hearts, held him firmly still,"
3228,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When th’ old one (held too strait for all his skill
3229,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To extricate) gave words, and question’d me:"
3230,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
3231,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘Which of the Gods, O Atreus’ son,’ said he,"
3232,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘Advis’d and taught thy fortitude this sleight,"
3233,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To take and hold me thus in my despite?’
3234,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,‘What asks thy wish now?’ I replied. ‘Thou know’st.
3235,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Why dost thou ask? What wiles are these thou show’st?
3236,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I have within this isle been held for wind
3237,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A wondrous time, and can by no means find"
3238,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,An end to my retention. It hath spent
3239,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The very heart in me. Give thou then vent
3240,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To doubts thus bound in me, ye Gods know all,"
3241,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which of the Godheads doth so foully fall
3242,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On my addression home, to stay me here,"
3243,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Avert me from my way, the fishy clear"
3244,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Barr’d to my passage?’ He replied: ‘Of force,"
3245,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If to thy home thou wishest free recourse,"
3246,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Jove, and all the other Deities,"
3247,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thou must exhibit solemn sacrifice;
3248,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then the black sea for thee shall be clear,"
3249,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Till thy lov’d country’s settled reach. But where
3250,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ask these rites thy performance? ’Tis a fate
3251,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To thee and thy affairs appropriate,"
3252,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That thou shalt never see thy friends, nor tread"
3253,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy country’s earth, nor see inhabited"
3254,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy so magnificent house, till thou make good"
3255,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy voyage back to the Ægyptian flood,"
3256,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose waters fell from Jove, and there hast giv’n"
3257,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Jove, and all Gods housed in ample heav’n,"
3258,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Devoted hecatombs, and then free ways"
3259,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall open to thee, clear’d of all delays.’"
3260,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This told he; and, methought, he brake my heart,"
3261,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In such a long and hard course to divert
3262,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My hope for home, and charge my back retreat"
3263,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As far as Ægypt. I made answer yet:
3264,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘Father, thy charge I’ll perfect; but before"
3265,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Resolve me truly, if their natural shore"
3266,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All those Greeks, and their ships, do safe enjoy,"
3267,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That Nestor and myself left, when from Troy"
3268,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,We first rais’d sail? Or whether any died
3269,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At sea a death unwish’d? Or, satisfied,"
3270,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When war was past, by friends embrac’d, in peace"
3271,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Resign’d their spirits? He made answer: ‘Cease
3272,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To ask so far. It fits thee not to be
3273,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So cunning in thine own calamity.
3274,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor seek to learn what learn’d thou shouldst forget.
3275,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Men’s knowledges have proper limits set,"
3276,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And should not prease into the mind of God.
3277,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But ’twill not long be, as my thoughts abode,"
3278,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Before thou buy this curious skill with tears.
3279,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Many of those, whose states so tempt thine ears,"
3280,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Are stoop’d by death, and many left alive,"
3281,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One chief of which in strong hold doth survive,"
3282,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amidst the broad sea. Two, in their retreat,"
3283,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Are done to death. I list not to repeat
3284,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who fell at Troy, thyself was there in fight,"
3285,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But in return swift Ajax lost the light,"
3286,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his long-oar’d ship. Neptune, yet, awhile"
3287,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Saft him unwrack’d, to the Gyræan isle,"
3288,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A mighty-rock removing from his way.
3289,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And surely he had ‘scap’d the fatal day,"
3290,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In spite of Pallas, if to that foul deed"
3291,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He in her fane did, (when he ravishéd"
3292,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Trojan prophetess) he had not here
3293,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Adjoin’d an impious boast, that he would bear,"
3294,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Despite the Gods, his ship safe through the waves"
3295,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then rais’d against him. These his impious braves
3296,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When Neptune heard, in his strong hand he took"
3297,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His massy trident, and so soundly strook"
3298,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The rock Gyræan, that in two it cleft;"
3299,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of which one fragment on the land he left,"
3300,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The other fell into the troubled seas;
3301,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At which first rush’d Ajax Oïliades,"
3302,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And split his ship, and then himself afloat"
3303,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Swum on the rough waves of the world’s vast mote,"
3304,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Till having drunk a salt cup for his sin,"
3305,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,There perish’d he. Thy brother yet did win
3306,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The wreath from death, while in the waves they strove,"
3307,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Afflicted by the rev’rend wife of Jove.
3308,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But when the steep mount of the Malian shore
3309,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He seem’d to reach, a most tempestuous blore,"
3310,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Far to the fishy world that sighs so sore,"
3311,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Straight ravish’d him again as far away,"
3312,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As to th’ extreme bounds where the Agrians stay,"
3313,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where first Thyestes dwelt, but then his son"
3314,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ægisthus Thyestiades liv’d. This done,"
3315,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When his return untouch’d appear’d again,"
3316,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Back turn’d the Gods the wind, and set him then"
3317,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hard by his house. Then, full of joy, he left"
3318,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His ship, and close t’ his country earth he cleft,"
3319,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Kiss’d it, and wept for joy, pour’d tear on tear,"
3320,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To set so wishedly his footing there.
3321,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But see, a sentinel that all the year"
3322,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Crafty Ægisthus in a watchtow’r set
3323,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To spy his landing, for reward as great"
3324,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As two gold talents, all his pow’rs did call"
3325,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To strict remembrance of his charge, and all"
3326,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Discharg’d at first sight, which at first he cast"
3327,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On Agamemnon, and with all his haste"
3328,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Inform’d Ægisthus. He an instant train
3329,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Laid for his slaughter: Twenty chosen men
3330,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of his plebeians he in ambush laid;
3331,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His other men he charg’d to see purvey’d
3332,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A feast; and forth, with horse and chariots grac’d,"
3333,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He rode t’ invite him, but in heart embrac’d"
3334,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Horrible welcomes, and to death did bring,"
3335,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With treach’rous slaughter, the unwary king,"
3336,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Receiv’d him at a feast, and, like an ox"
3337,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Slain at his manger, gave him bits and knocks."
3338,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No one left of Atrides’ train, nor one"
3339,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sav’d to Ægisthus, but himself alone,"
3340,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All strew’d together there the bloody court.’
3341,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, my soul he sunk with his report,"
3342,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Flat on the sands I fell, tears spent their store,"
3343,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I light abhorr’d, my heart would live no more."
3344,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When dry of tears, and tir’d of tumbling there,"
3345,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Th’ old Tell-truth thus my daunted spirits did cheer:
3346,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘No more spend tears nor time, O Atreus’ son,"
3347,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With ceaseless weeping never wish was won,"
3348,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Use uttermost assay to reach thy home,"
3349,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all unwares upon the murderer come,"
3350,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For torture, taking him thyself alive;"
3351,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or let Orestes, that should far out-strive"
3352,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thee in fit vengeance, quickly quit the light"
3353,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of such a dark soul, and do thou the rite"
3354,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of burial to him with a funeral feast.’
3355,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
3356,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With these last words I fortified my breast,"
3357,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In which again a gen’rous spring began
3358,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of fitting comfort, as I was a man;"
3359,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, as a brother, I must ever mourn."
3360,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet forth I went, and told him the return"
3361,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of these I knew; but he had nam’d a third,"
3362,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Held on the broad sea, still with life inspir’d,"
3363,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom I besought to know, though likewise dead,"
3364,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And I must mourn alike. He answeréd:
3365,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,‘He is Laertes’ son; whom I beheld
3366,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In nymph Calypso’s palace, who compell’d"
3367,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His stay with her, and, since he could not see"
3368,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His country earth, he mourn’d incessantly."
3369,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For he had neither ship instruct with oars,"
3370,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor men to fetch him from those stranger shores.
3371,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where leave we him, and to thy self descend,"
3372,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom not in Argos Fate nor Death shall end,"
3373,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But the immortal ends of all the earth,"
3374,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So rul’d by them that order death by birth,"
3375,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fields Elysian, Fate to thee will give;"
3376,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where Rhadamanthus rules, and where men live"
3377,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A never-troubled life, where snow, nor show’rs,"
3378,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor irksome Winter spends his fruitless pow’rs,"
3379,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But from the ocean Zephyr still resumes
3380,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A constant breath, that all the fields perfumes."
3381,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which, since thou marriedst Helen, are thy hire,"
3382,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And Jove himself is by her side thy sire.’
3383,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This said; he div’d the deepsome wat’ry heaps;
3384,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I and my tried men took us to our ships,"
3385,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And worlds of thoughts I varied with my steps.
3386,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Arriv’d and shipp’d, the silent solemn night"
3387,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And sleep bereft us of our visual light.
3388,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At morn, masts, sails, rear’d, we sat, left the shores,"
3389,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And beat the foamy ocean with our oars.
3390,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Again then we the Jove-fall’n flood did fetch,"
3391,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As far as Ægypt; where we did beseech
3392,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Gods with hecatombs; whose angers ceast,"
3393,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I tomb’d my brother that I might be blest.
3394,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All rites perform’d, all haste I made for home,"
3395,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all the prosp’rous winds about were come,"
3396,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I had the passport now of ev’ry God,"
3397,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And here clos’d all these labours’ period.
3398,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Here stay then till th’ eleventh or twelfth day’s light,"
3399,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And I’ll dismiss thee well, gifts exquisite"
3400,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Preparing for thee, chariot, horses three,"
3401,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A cup of curious frame to serve for thee
3402,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To serve th’ immortal Gods with sacrifice,"
3403,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Mindful of me while all suns light thy skies.”
3404,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He answer’d: “Stay me not too long time here,"
3405,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Though I could sit attending all the year.
3406,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor should my house, nor parents, with desire,"
3407,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Take my affections from you, so on fire"
3408,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With love to hear you are my thoughts; but so
3409,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My Pylian friends I shall afflict with woe
3410,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Who mourn ev’n this stay. Whatsoever be
3411,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The gifts your grace is to bestow on me,"
3412,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Vouchsafe them such as I may bear and save
3413,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For your sake ever. Horse, I list not have,"
3414,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To keep in Ithaca, but leave them here,"
3415,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To your soil’s dainties, where the broad fields bear"
3416,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sweet cypers grass, where men-fed lote doth flow,"
3417,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where wheat-like spelt, and wheat itself, doth grow,"
3418,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where barley, white, and spreading like a tree;"
3419,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But Ithaca hath neither ground to be,"
3420,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For any length it comprehends, a race"
3421,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To try a horse’s speed, nor any place"
3422,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To make him fat in; fitter far to feed
3423,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A cliff-bred goat, than raise or please a steed."
3424,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all isles, Ithaca doth least provide"
3425,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or meads to feed a horse, or ways to ride.”"
3426,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He, smiling, said: “Of good blood art thou, son."
3427,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What speech, so young! What observatión"
3428,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Hast thou made of the world! I well am pleas’d
3429,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To change my gifts to thee, as being confess’d"
3430,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Unfit indeed, my store is such I may."
3431,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all my house-gifts then, that up I lay"
3432,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For treasure there, I will bestow on thee"
3433,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fairest, and of greatest price to me."
3434,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I will bestow on thee a rich carv’d cup,"
3435,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of silver all, but all the brims wrought up"
3436,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With finest gold; it was the only thing
3437,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That the heroical Sidonian king
3438,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Presented to me, when we were to part"
3439,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At his receipt of me, and ’twas the art"
3440,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of that great Artist that of heav’n is free;
3441,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And yet ev’n this will I bestow on thee.”
3442,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This speech thus ended, guests came, and did bring"
3443,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Muttons, for presents, to the God-like king,"
3444,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And spirit-prompting wine, that strenuous makes."
3445,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their riband-wreathed wives brought fruit and cakes.
3446,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus in this house did these their feast apply;
3447,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And in Ulysses’ house activity
3448,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Wooers practis’d; tossing of the spear,"
3449,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The stone, and hurling; thus delighted, where"
3450,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They exercis’d such insolence before,"
3451,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ev’n in the court that wealthy pavements wore
3452,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Antinous did still their strifes decide,"
3453,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And he that was in person deified
3454,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eurymachus; both ring-leaders of all,"
3455,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For in their virtues they were principal.
3456,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These by Noëmon, son to Phronius,"
3457,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were sided now, who made the question thus:"
3458,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Antinous! Does any friend here know,"
3459,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When this Telemachus returns, or no,"
3460,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From sandy Pylos? He made bold to take
3461,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My ship with him; of which, I now should make"
3462,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fit use myself, and sail in her as far"
3463,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As spacious Elis, where of mine there are"
3464,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Twelve delicate mares, and under their sides go"
3465,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Laborious mules, that yet did never know"
3466,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The yoke, nor labour; some of which should bear"
3467,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The taming now, if I could fetch them there.”"
3468,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This speech the rest admir’d, nor dream’d that he"
3469,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Neleïan Pylos ever thought to see,"
3470,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But was at field about his flocks’ survey,"
3471,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or thought his herdsmen held him so away.
3472,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eupitheus son, Antinous, then replied:"
3473,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“When went he, or with what train dignified?"
3474,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of his selected Ithacensian youth?
3475,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Prest men, or bond men, were they? Tell the truth."
3476,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Could he effect this? Let me truly know.
3477,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To gain thy vessel did he violence show,"
3478,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And us’d her ’gainst thy will? or had her free,"
3479,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When fitting question he had made with thee?”
3480,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Noëmon answer’d: “I did freely give
3481,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My vessel to him. Who deserves to live
3482,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That would do other, when such men as he"
3483,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Did in distress ask? He should churlish be
3484,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That would deny him. Of our youth the best
3485,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the people, to the interest"
3486,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His charge did challenge in them, giving way,"
3487,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With all the tribute all their pow’rs could pay.
3488,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their captain, as he took the ship, I knew,"
3489,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who Mentor was, or God. A Deity’s shew"
3490,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mask’d in his likeness. But, to think ’twas he,"
3491,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I much admire, for I did clearly see,"
3492,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But yester-morning, God-like Mentor here;"
3493,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet th’ other ev’ning he took shipping there,"
3494,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And went for Pylos.” Thus went he for home,"
3495,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And left the rest with envy overcome;
3496,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who sat, and pastime left. Eupitheus son,"
3497,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sad, and with rage his entrails overrun,"
3498,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His eyes like flames, thus interpos’d his speech:"
3499,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“Strange thing! An action of how proud a reach
3500,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Is here committed by Telemachus!
3501,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A boy, a child, and we, a sort of us,"
3502,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Vow’d ’gainst his voyage, yet admit it thus!"
3503,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With ship and choice youth of our people too!
3504,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But let him on, and all his mischief do,"
3505,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove shall convert upon himself his pow’rs,"
3506,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Before their ill presum’d he brings on ours.
3507,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Provide me then a ship, and twenty men"
3508,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To give her manage, that, against again"
3509,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He turns for home, on th’ Ithacensian seas,"
3510,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or cliffy Samian, I may interprease,"
3511,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Way-lay, and take him, and make all his craft"
3512,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Sail with his ruin for his father saft.”
3513,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This all applauded, and gave charge to do,"
3514,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rose, and to greet Ulysses’ house did go."
3515,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But long time past not, ere Penelope"
3516,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Had notice of their far-fetch’d treachery.
3517,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Medon the herald told her, who had heard"
3518,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Without the hall how they within conferr’d,"
3519,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And hasted straight to tell it to the queen,"
3520,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who, from the entry having Medon seen,"
3521,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Prevents him thus: “Now herald, what affair"
3522,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Intend the famous Wooers, in your repair?"
3523,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To tell Ulysses’ maids that they must cease
3524,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From doing our work, and their banquets dress?"
3525,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I would to heav’n, that, leaving wooing me,"
3526,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor ever troubling other company,"
3527,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Here might the last feast be, and most extreme,"

3888,E.,But th’ end shall crown all; therefore Fate will deal
3889,E.,"So well with him, to let him land, and see"
3890,E.,"His native earth, friends, house, and family.”"
3891,E.,"Thus charg’d he; nor Argicides denied,"
3892,E.,"But to his feet his fair wing’d shoes he tied,"
3893,E.,"Ambrosian, golden, that in his command"
3894,E.,"Put either sea, or the unmeasur’d land,"
3895,E.,With pace as speedy as a puft of wind.
3896,E.,"Then up his rod went, with which he declin’d"
3897,E.,"The eyes of any waker, when he pleas’d,"
3898,E.,"And any sleeper, when he wish’d, diseas’d."
3899,E.,"This took; he stoop’d Pieria, and thence"
3900,E.,"Glid through the air, and Neptune’s confluence"
3901,E.,"Kiss’d as he flew, and check’d the waves as light"
3902,E.,"As any sea-mew in her fishing flight,"
3903,E.,Her thick wings sousing in the savory seas.
3904,E.,"Like her, he pass’d a world of wilderness;"
3905,E.,"But when the far-off isle he touch’d, he went"
3906,E.,"Up from the blue sea to the continent,"
3907,E.,"And reach’d the ample cavern of the Queen,"
3908,E.,"Whom he within found, without seldom seen."
3909,E.,"A sun-like fire upon the hearth did flame,"
3910,E.,"The matter precious, and divine the frame,"
3911,E.,"Of cedar cleft and incense was the pile,"
3912,E.,That breath’d an odour round about the isle.
3913,E.,"Herself was seated in an inner room,"
3914,E.,"Whom sweetly sing he heard, and at her loom,"
3915,E.,"About a curious web, whose yarn she threw"
3916,E.,In with a golden shittle. A grove grew
3917,E.,"In endless spring about her cavern round,"
3918,E.,"With odorous cypress, pines, and poplars, crown’d,"
3919,E.,"Where hawks, sea-owls, and long-tongued bittours bred,"
3920,E.,And other birds their shady pinions spread;
3921,E.,"All fowls maritimal; none roosted there,"
3922,E.,But those whose labours in the waters were.
3923,E.,"A vine did all the hollow cave embrace,"
3924,E.,"Still green, yet still ripe bunches gave it grace."
3925,E.,"Four fountains, one against another, pour’d"
3926,E.,Their silver streams; and meadows all enflower’d
3927,E.,"With sweet balm-gentle, and blue-violets hid,"
3928,E.,That deck’d the soft breasts of each fragrant mead.
3929,E.,"Should anyone, though he immortal were,"
3930,E.,"Arrive and see the sacred objects there,"
3931,E.,"He would admire them, and be over-joy’d;"
3932,E.,"And so stood Hermes’ ravish’d pow’rs employ’d,"
3933,E.,"But having all admir’d, he enter’d on"
3934,E.,"The ample cave, nor could be seen unknown"
3935,E.,Of great Calypso (for all Deities are
3936,E.,"Prompt in each other’s knowledge, though so far"
3937,E.,Sever’d in dwellings) but he could not see
3938,E.,"Ulysses there within; without was he,"
3939,E.,"Set sad ashore, where ’twas his use to view"
3940,E.,"Th’ unquiet sea, sigh’d, wept, and empty drew"
3941,E.,"His heart of comfort. Plac’d here in her throne,"
3942,E.,"That beams cast up to admiratión,"
3943,E.,Divine Calypso question’d Hermes thus:
3944,E.,"“For what cause, dear, and much-esteem’d by us,"
3945,E.,"Thou golden-rod-adorned Mercury,"
3946,E.,Arriv’st thou here? Thou hast not us’d t’ apply
3947,E.,"Thy passage this way. Say, whatever be"
3948,E.,"Thy heart’s desire, my mind commands it thee,"
3949,E.,"If in my means it lie, or pow’r of fact."
3950,E.,"But first, what hospitable rites exact,"
3951,E.,"Come yet more near, and take.” This said, she set"
3952,E.,"A table forth, and furnish’d it with meat,"
3953,E.,Such as the Gods taste; and serv’d in with it
3954,E.,Vermilion nectar. When with banquet fit
3955,E.,"He had confirm’d his spirits, he thus exprest"
3956,E.,"His cause of coming: “Thou hast made request,"
3957,E.,"Goddess of Goddesses, to understand"
3958,E.,"My cause of touch here; which thou shalt command,"
3959,E.,And know with truth: Jove caus’d my course to thee
3960,E.,"Against my will, for who would willingly"
3961,E.,"Lackey along so vast a lake of brine,"
3962,E.,Near to no city that the Pow’rs divine
3963,E.,Receives with solemn rites and hecatombs?
3964,E.,"But Jove’s will ever all law overcomes,"
3965,E.,No other God can cross or make it void;
3966,E.,"And he affirms, that one the most annoy’d"
3967,E.,With woes and toils of all those men that fought
3968,E.,"For Priam’s city, and to end hath brought"
3969,E.,"Nine years in the contention, is with thee."
3970,E.,"For in the tenth year, when roy victory"
3971,E.,"Was won to give the Greeks the spoil of Troy,"
3972,E.,"Return they did profess, but not enjoy,"
3973,E.,"Since Pallas they incens’d, and she the waves"
3974,E.,"By all the winds’ pow’r, that blew ope their graves."
3975,E.,And there they rested. Only this poor one
3976,E.,This coast both winds and waves have cast upon;
3977,E.,"Whom now forthwith he wills thee to dismiss,"
3978,E.,Affirming that th’ unalter’d Destinies
3979,E.,Not only have decreed he shall not die
3980,E.,"Apart his friends, but of necessity"
3981,E.,"Enjoy their sights before those fatal hours,"
3982,E.,"His country earth reach, and erected tow’rs.”"
3983,E.,"This struck a love-check’d horror through her pow’rs,"
3984,E.,"When, naming him, she this reply did give:"
3985,E.,"“Insatiate are ye Gods, past all that live,"
3986,E.,In all things you affect; which still converts
3987,E.,"Your pow’rs to envies. It afflicts your hearts,"
3988,E.,"That any Goddess should, as you obtain"
3989,E.,"The use of earthly dames, enjoy the men,"
3990,E.,"And most in open marriage. So ye far’d,"
3991,E.,When the delicious-finger’d Morning shar’d
3992,E.,Orion’s bed; you easy-living States
3993,E.,"Could never satisfy your emulous hates,"
3994,E.,"Till in Ortygia the precise-liv’d Dame,"
3995,E.,"Gold-thron’d Diana, on him rudely came,"
3996,E.,"And with her swift shafts slew him. And such pains,"
3997,E.,When rich-hair’d Ceres pleas’d to give the reins
3998,E.,"To her affections, and the grace did yield"
3999,E.,"Of love and bed, amidst a three-cropp’d field,"
4000,E.,"To her Iasion, he paid angry Jove,"
4001,E.,"Who lost no long time notice of their love,"
4002,E.,But with a glowing lightning was his death.
4003,E.,And now your envies labour underneath
4004,E.,A mortal’s choice of mine; whose life I took
4005,E.,"To lib’ral safety, when his ship Jove strook,"
4006,E.,"With red-hot flashes, piece-meal in the seas,"
4007,E.,And all his friends and soldiers succourless
4008,E.,"Perish’d but he. Him, cast upon this coast"
4009,E.,"With blasts and billows, I, in life giv’n lost,"
4010,E.,"Preserv’d alone, lov’d, nourish’d, and did vow"
4011,E.,"To make him deathless, and yet never grow"
4012,E.,"Crooked, or worn with age, his whole life long."
4013,E.,But since no reason may be made so strong
4014,E.,"To strive with Jove’s will, or to make it vain,"
4015,E.,No not if all the other Gods should strain
4016,E.,"Their pow’rs against it, let his will be law,"
4017,E.,"So he afford him fit means to withdraw,"
4018,E.,"As he commands him, to the raging main."
4019,E.,"But means from me he never shall obtain,"
4020,E.,"For my means yield nor men, nor ship, nor oars,"
4021,E.,To set him off from my so envied shores.
4022,E.,But if my counsel and good will can aid
4023,E.,"His safe pass home, my best shall be assay’d.”"
4024,E.,"“Vouchsafe it so,” said heav’n’s ambassador,"
4025,E.,“And deign it quickly. By all means abhor
4026,E.,"T’ incense Jove’s wrath against thee, that with grace"
4027,E.,He may hereafter all thy wish embrace.”
4028,E.,Thus took the Argus-killing God his wings.
4029,E.,And since the rev’rend Nymph these awful things
4030,E.,"Receiv’d from Jove, she to Ulysses went;"
4031,E.,"Whom she ashore found, drown’d in discontent,"
4032,E.,"His eyes kept never dry he did so mourn,"
4033,E.,And waste his dear age for his wish’d return;
4034,E.,"Which still without the cave he us’d to do,"
4035,E.,"Because he could not please the Goddess so,"
4036,E.,"At night yet, forc’d, together took their rest,"
4037,E.,The willing Goddess and th’ unwilling Guest;
4038,E.,"But he all day in rocks, and on the shore,"
4039,E.,"The vex’d sea view’d, and did his fate deplore."
4040,E.,"Him, now, the Goddess coming near bespake:"
4041,E.,"“Unhappy man, no more discomfort take"
4042,E.,"For my constraint of thee, nor waste thine age,"
4043,E.,I now will passing freely disengage
4044,E.,"Thy irksome stay here. Come then, fell thee wood,"
4045,E.,"And build a ship, to save thee from the flood."
4046,E.,"I’ll furnish thee with fresh wave, bread, and wine"
4047,E.,"Ruddy and sweet, that will the piner pine,[2]"
4048,E.,"Put garments on thee, give the winds foreright,"
4049,E.,That ev’ry way thy home-bent appetite
4050,E.,May safe attain to it; if so it please
4051,E.,"At all parts all the heav’n-hous’d Deities,"
4052,E.,"That more in pow’r are, more in skill, than I,"
4053,E.,And more can judge what fits humanity.”
4054,E.,"He stood amaz’d at this strange change in her,"
4055,E.,And said: “O Goddess! Thy intents prefer
4056,E.,"Some other project than my parting hence,"
4057,E.,Commanding things of too high consequence
4058,E.,"For my performance, that myself should build"
4059,E.,"A ship of pow’r, my home-assays to shield"
4060,E.,Against the great sea of such dread to pass;
4061,E.,Which not the best-built ship that ever was
4062,E.,"Will pass exulting, when such winds, as Jove"
4063,E.,"Can thunder up, their trims and tacklings prove."
4064,E.,"But could I build one, I would ne’er aboard,"
4065,E.,"Thy will oppos’d, nor, won, without thy word,"
4066,E.,"Giv’n in the great oath of the Gods to me,"
4067,E.,Not to beguile me in the least degree.”
4068,E.,"The Goddess smil’d, held hard his hand, and said:"
4069,E.,"“O y’ are a shrewd one, and so habited"
4070,E.,In taking heed thou know’st not what it is
4071,E.,"To be unwary, nor use words amiss."
4072,E.,"How hast thou charm’d me, were I ne’er so sly!"
4073,E.,"Let earth know then, and heav’n, so broad, so high,"
4074,E.,"And th’ under-sunk waves of th’ infernal stream,"
4075,E.,"(Which is an oath, as terribly supreme,"
4076,E.,As any God swears) that I had no thought
4077,E.,"But stood with what I spake, nor would have wrought,"
4078,E.,"Nor counsell’d, any act against thy good;"
4079,E.,"But ever diligently weigh’d, and stood"
4080,E.,"On those points in persuading thee, that I"
4081,E.,Would use myself in such extremity.
4082,E.,"For my mind simple is, and innocent,"
4083,E.,"Not giv’n by cruel sleights to circumvent,"
4084,E.,"Nor bear I in my breast a heart of steel,"
4085,E.,But with the suff’rer willing suff’rance feel.”
4086,E.,"This said, the Grace of Goddesses led home,"
4087,E.,"He trac’d her steps; and, to the cavern come,"
4088,E.,"In that rich throne, whence Mercury arose,"
4089,E.,"He sat. The Nymph herself did then appose,"
4090,E.,"For food and bev’rage, to him all best meat"
4091,E.,"And drink, that mortals use to taste and eat."
4092,E.,"Then sat she opposite, and for her feast"
4093,E.,Was nectar and ambrosia addrest
4094,E.,"By handmaids to her. Both, what was prepar’d,"
4095,E.,"Did freely fall to. Having fitly far’d,"
4096,E.,The Nymph Calypso this discourse began:
4097,E.,“Jove-bred Ulysses! Many-witted man!
4098,E.,"Still is thy home so wish’d? So soon, away?"
4099,E.,"Be still of cheer, for all the worst I say."
4100,E.,"But, if thy soul knew what a sum of woes,"
4101,E.,"For thee to cast up, thy stern Fates impose,"
4102,E.,"Ere to thy country earth thy hopes attain,"
4103,E.,"Undoubtedly thy choice would here remain,"
4104,E.,"Keep house with me, and be a liver ever."
4105,E.,"Which, methinks, should thy house and thee dissever,"
4106,E.,"Though for thy wife there thou art set on fire,"
4107,E.,And all thy days are spent in her desire;
4108,E.,And though it be no boast in me to say
4109,E.,In form and mind I match her ev’ry way.
4110,E.,"Nor can it fit a mortal dame’s compare,"
4111,E.,T’ affect those terms with us that deathless are.”
4112,E.,The great-in-counsels made her this reply:
4113,E.,"“Renown’d, and to be rev’renc’d, Deity!"
4114,E.,"Let it not move thee, that so much I vow"
4115,E.,My comforts to my wife; though well I know
4116,E.,All cause myself why wise Penelope
4117,E.,"In wit is far inferior to thee,"
4118,E.,"In feature, stature, all the parts of show,"
4119,E.,"She being a mortal, an immortal thou,"
4120,E.,"Old ever growing, and yet never old."
4121,E.,"Yet her desire shall all my days see told,"
4122,E.,"Adding the sight of my returning day,"
4123,E.,And natural home. If any God shall lay
4124,E.,"His hand upon me as I pass the seas,"
4125,E.,"I’ll bear the worst of what his hand shall please,"
4126,E.,As having giv’n me such a mind as shall
4127,E.,The more still rise the more his hand lets fall.
4128,E.,In wars and waves my suff’rings were not small.
4129,E.,"I now have suffer’d much, as much before,"
4130,E.,"Hereafter let as much result, and more.”"
4131,E.,"This said, the sun set, and earth shadows gave;"
4132,E.,"When these two (in an in-room of the cave,"
4133,E.,Left to themselves) left love no rites undone.
4134,E.,"The early Morn up, up he rose, put on"
4135,E.,His in and out weed. She herself enchaces
4136,E.,"Amidst a white robe, full of all the Graces,"
4137,E.,"Ample, and pleated thick like fishy scales;"
4138,E.,A golden girdle then her waist impales;
4139,E.,Her head a veil decks; and abroad they come.
4140,E.,And now began Ulysses to go home.
4141,E.,"A great axe first she gave, that two ways cut,"
4142,E.,"In which a fair well-polish’d helm was put,"
4143,E.,That from an olive bough receiv’d his frame.
4144,E.,"A plainer then. Then led she, till they came"
4145,E.,To lofty woods that did the isle confine.
4146,E.,"The fir-tree, poplar, and heav’n-scaling pine,"
4147,E.,"Had there their offspring. Of which, those that were"
4148,E.,"Of driest matter, and grew longest there,"
4149,E.,"He choos’d for lighter sail. This place thus shown,"
4150,E.,"The Nymph turn’d home. He fell to felling down,"
4151,E.,"And twenty trees he stoop’d in little space,"
4152,E.,"Plain’d, used his plumb, did all with artful grace."
4153,E.,In mean time did Calypso wimbles bring.
4154,E.,"He bor’d, clos’d, nail’d, and order’d ev’ry thing,"
4155,E.,And look how much a ship-wright will allow
4156,E.,A ship of burden (one that best doth know
4157,E.,"What fits his art) so large a keel he cast,"
4158,E.,"Wrought up her decks, and hatches, side-boards, mast,"
4159,E.,With willow watlings arm’d her to resist
4160,E.,"The billows’ outrage, added all she miss’d,"
4161,E.,"Sail-yards, and stern for guide. The Nymph then brought"
4162,E.,"Linen for sails, which with dispatch he wrought,"
4163,E.,"Gables, and halsters, tacklings. All the frame"
4164,E.,In four days’ space to full perfection came.[3]
4165,E.,"The fifth day, they dismiss’d him from the shore,"
4166,E.,"Weeds neat, and odorous, gave him, victuals store,"
4167,E.,"Wine, strong waters, and a prosp’rous wind,"
4168,E.,"To which, Ulysses, fit-to-be-divin’d,"
4169,E.,"His sails expos’d, and hoiséd. Off he gat;"
4170,E.,"And cheerful was he. At the stern he sat,"
4171,E.,And steer’d right artfully. Nor sleep could seize
4172,E.,His eye-lids. He beheld the Pleiades;
4173,E.,"The Bear, surnam’d the Wain, that round doth move"
4174,E.,"About Orion, and keeps still above"
4175,E.,The billowy ocean; the slow-setting star
4176,E.,"Bootes call’d, by some the Waggoner."
4177,E.,Calypso warn’d him he his course should steer
4178,E.,Still to his left hand. Seventeen days did clear
4179,E.,"The cloudy night’s command in his moist way,"
4180,E.,And by the eighteenth light he might display
4181,E.,"The shady hills of the Phæacian shore,"
4182,E.,"For which, as to his next abode, he bore."
4183,E.,"The country did a pretty figure yield,"
4184,E.,And look’d from off the dark seas like a shield.
4185,E.,"Imperious Neptune, making his retreat"
4186,E.,"From th’ Æthiopian earth, and taking seat"
4187,E.,"Upon the mountains of the Solymi,"
4188,E.,"From thence, far off discov’ring, did descry"
4189,E.,Ulysses his fields ploughing. All on fire
4190,E.,"The sight straight set his heart, and made desire"
4191,E.,"Of wreak run over, it did boil so high."
4192,E.,"When, his head nodding; “O impiety,”"
4193,E.,"He cried out, “now the Gods’ inconstancy"
4194,E.,"Is most apparent, alt’ring their designs"
4195,E.,"Since I the Æthiops saw, and here confines"
4196,E.,To this Ulysses’ fate his misery.
4197,E.,"The great mark, on which all his hopes rely,"
4198,E.,Lies in Phæacia. But I hope he shall
4199,E.,"Feel woe at height, ere that dead calm befall.”"
4200,E.,"This said; he, begging, gather’d clouds from land,[4]"
4201,E.,"Frighted the seas up, snatch’d into his hand"
4202,E.,"His horrid trident, and aloft did toss,"
4203,E.,"Of all the winds, all storms he could engross,"
4204,E.,"All earth took into sea with clouds, grim Night"
4205,E.,"Fell tumbling headlong from the cope of light,"
4206,E.,"The East and South winds justled in the air,"
4207,E.,"The violent Zephyr, and North making-fair,"
4208,E.,Roll’d up the waves before them. And then bent
4209,E.,"Ulysses’ knees, then all his spirit was spent."
4210,E.,"In which despair, he thus spake: “Woe is me!"
4211,E.,"What was I born to, man of misery!"
4212,E.,"Fear tells me now, that, all the Goddess said,"
4213,E.,"Truth’s self will author, that Fate would be paid"
4214,E.,"Grief’s whole sum due from me, at sea, before"
4215,E.,I reach’d the dear touch of my country’s shore.
4216,E.,With what clouds Jove heav’n’s heighten’d forehead binds!
4217,E.,How tyrannize the wraths of all the winds!
4218,E.,"How all the tops he bottoms with the deeps,"
4219,E.,And in the bottoms all the tops he steeps!
4220,E.,Thus dreadful is the presence of our death.
4221,E.,Thrice four times blest were they that sunk beneath
4222,E.,"Their fates at Troy, and did to nought contend"
4223,E.,But to renown Atrides with their end!
4224,E.,"I would to God, my hour of death and fate"
4225,E.,"That day had held the’ pow’r to terminate,"
4226,E.,When show’rs of darts my life bore undepress’d
4227,E.,About divine Æacides deceas’d!
4228,E.,"Then had I been allotted to have died,"
4229,E.,"By all the Greeks with fun’rals glorified,"
4230,E.,"(Whence death, encouraging good life, had grown)"
4231,E.,"Where now I die, by no man mourn’d nor known.”"
4232,E.,"This spoke, a huge wave took him by the head,"
4233,E.,And hurl’d him o’er board; ship and all it laid
4234,E.,"Inverted quite amidst the waves, but he"
4235,E.,"Far off from her sprawl’d, strow’d about the sea,"
4236,E.,"His stern still holding broken off, his mast"
4237,E.,"Burst in the midst, so horrible a blast"
4238,E.,Of mix’d winds struck it. Sails and sail-yards fell
4239,E.,Amongst the billows; and himself did dwell
4240,E.,"A long time under water, nor could get"
4241,E.,"In haste his head out, wave with wave so met"
4242,E.,"In his depression; and his garments too,"
4243,E.,"Giv’n by Calypso, gave him much to do,"
4244,E.,Hind’ring his swimming; yet he left not so
4245,E.,"His drenchéd vessel, for the overthrow"
4246,E.,"Of her nor him, but gat at length again,"
4247,E.,"Wrastling with Neptune, hold of her; and then"
4248,E.,"Sat in her bulk, insulting over death,"
4249,E.,"Which, with the salt stream prest to stop his breath,"
4250,E.,"He ’scap’d, and gave the sea again to give"
4251,E.,"To other men. His ship so striv’d to live,"
4252,E.,"Floating at random, cuff’d from wave to wave."
4253,E.,As you have seen the North wind when he drave
4254,E.,In autumn heaps of thorn-fed grasshoppers
4255,E.,"Hither and thither, one heap this way bears,"
4256,E.,"Another that, and makes them often meet"
4257,E.,in his confus’d gales; so Ulysses’ fleet
4258,E.,The winds hurl’d up and down; now Boreas
4259,E.,"Toss’d it to Notus, Notus gave it pass"
4260,E.,"To Eurus, Eurus Zephyr made pursue"
4261,E.,The horrid tennis. This sport call’d the view
4262,E.,"Of Cadmus’ daughter, with the narrow heel,"
4263,E.,"Ino Leucothea, that first did feel"
4264,E.,"A mortal dame’s desires, and had a tongue,"
4265,E.,But now had th’ honour to be nam’d among
4266,E.,The marine Godheads. She with pity saw
4267,E.,"Ulysses justled thus from flaw to flaw,"
4268,E.,"And, like a cormorant in form and flight,"
4269,E.,"Rose from a whirl-pool, on the ship did light,"
4270,E.,And thus bespake him: “Why is Neptune thus
4271,E.,"In thy pursuit extremely furious,"
4272,E.,"Oppressing thee with such a world of ill,"
4273,E.,"Ev’n to thy death? He must not serve his will,"
4274,E.,Though ’tis his study. Let me then advise
4275,E.,As my thoughts serve; thou shalt not be unwise
4276,E.,To leave thy weeds and ship to the commands
4277,E.,"Of these rude winds, and work out with thy hands"
4278,E.,"Pass to Phæacia, where thy austere Fate"
4279,E.,Is to pursue thee with no more such hate.
4280,E.,"Take here this tablet, with this riband strung,"
4281,E.,And see it still about thy bosom hung;
4282,E.,By whose eternal virtue never fear
4283,E.,"To suffer thus again, nor perish here."
4284,E.,"But when thou touchest with thy hand the shore,"
4285,E.,"Then take it from thy neck, nor wear it more,"
4286,E.,"But cast it far off from the continent,"
4287,E.,And then thy person far ashore present.
4288,E.,"Thus gave she him the tablet; and again,"
4289,E.,"Turn’d to a cormorant, div’d, past sight, the main."
4290,E.,"Patient Ulysses sigh’d at this, and stuck"
4291,E.,"In the conceit of such fair-spoken luck,"
4292,E.,"And said: “Alas! I must suspect ev’n this,"
4293,E.,Lest any other of the Deities
4294,E.,"Add sleight to Neptune’s force, to counsel me"
4295,E.,"To leave my vessel, and so far off see"
4296,E.,The shore I aim at. Not with thoughts too clear
4297,E.,"Will I obey her, but to me appear"
4298,E.,These counsels best: As long as I perceive
4299,E.,"My ship not quite dissolv’d, I will not leave"
4300,E.,"The help she may afford me, but abide,"
4301,E.,And suffer all woes till the worst be tried.
4302,E.,"When she is split, I’ll swim. No miracle can,"
4303,E.,"Past near and clear means, move a knowing man.”"
4304,E.,"While this discourse employ’d him, Neptune rais’d"
4305,E.,"A huge, a high, and horrid sea, that seiz’d"
4306,E.,"Him and his ship, and toss’d them through the lake."
4307,E.,As when the violent winds together take
4308,E.,"Heaps of dry chaff, and hurl them ev’ry way;"
4309,E.,So his long wood-stack Neptune strook astray
4310,E.,"Then did Ulysses mount on rib, perforce,"
4311,E.,"Like to a rider of a running horse,"
4312,E.,"To stay himself a time, while he might shift"
4313,E.,"His drenched weeds, that were Calypso’s gift."
4314,E.,When putting straight Leucothea’s amulet
4315,E.,"About his neck, he all his forces set"
4316,E.,"To swim, and cast him prostrate to the seas."
4317,E.,When pow’rful Neptune saw the ruthless prease
4318,E.,"Of perils siege him thus, he mov’d his head,"
4319,E.,And this betwixt him and his heart he said:
4320,E.,"“So, now feel ills enow, and struggle so,"
4321,E.,Till to your Jove-lov’d islanders you row.
4322,E.,"But my mind says, you will not so avoid"
4323,E.,"This last task too, but be with suff’rance cloy’d.”"
4324,E.,"This said, his rich-man’d horse he mov’d, and reach’d"
4325,E.,His house at Ægas. But Minerva fetch’d
4326,E.,"The winds from sea, and all their ways but one"
4327,E.,Barr’d to their passage; the bleak North alone
4328,E.,"She set to blow, the rest she charg’d to keep"
4329,E.,"Their rages in, and bind themselves in sleep."
4330,E.,"But Boreas still flew high to break the seas,"
4331,E.,Till Jove-bred Ithacus the more with ease
4332,E.,The navigation-skill’d Phæacian states
4333,E.,"Might make his refuge, Death and angry Fates"
4334,E.,"At length escaping. Two nights, yet, and days"
4335,E.,He spent in wrastling with the sable seas;
4336,E.,"In which space, often did his heart propose"
4337,E.,"Death to his eyes. But when Aurora rose,"
4338,E.,"And threw the third light from her orient hair,"
4339,E.,"The winds grew calm, and clear was all the air,"
4340,E.,"Not one breath stirring. Then he might descry,"
4341,E.,"Rais’d by the high seas, clear, and land was nigh."
4342,E.,"And then, look how to good sons that esteem"
4343,E.,"Their father’s life dear, (after pains extreme,"
4344,E.,"Felt in some sickness, that hath held him long"
4345,E.,"Down to his bed, and with affections strong"
4346,E.,"Wasted his body, made his life his load,"
4347,E.,As being inflicted by some angry God)
4348,E.,When on their pray’rs they see descend at length
4349,E.,"Health from the heav’ns, clad all in spirit and strength,"
4350,E.,"The sight is precious; so, since here should end"
4351,E.,"Ulysses’ toils, which therein should extend"
4352,E.,"Health to his country, held to him his sire"
4353,E.,"And on which long for him disease did tire,"
4354,E.,"And then, besides, for his own sake to see"
4355,E.,"The shores, the woods so near, such joy had he,"
4356,E.,As those good sons for their recover’d sire.
4357,E.,Then labour’d feet and all parts to aspire
4358,E.,To that wish’d continent; which when as near
4359,E.,"He came, as Clamour might inform an ear,"
4360,E.,"He heard a sound beat from the sea-bred rocks,"
4361,E.,"Against which gave a huge sea horrid shocks,"
4362,E.,"That belch’d upon the firm land weeds and foam,"
4363,E.,"With which were all things hid there, where no room"
4364,E.,"Of fit capacity was for any port,"
4365,E.,"Nor from the sea for any man’s resort,"
4366,E.,"The shores, the rocks, the cliff’s, so prominent were."
4367,E.,"“O,” said Ulysses then, “now Jupiter"
4368,E.,"Hath giv’n me sight of an unhop’d for shore,"
4369,E.,"Though I have wrought these seas so long, so sore."
4370,E.,"Of rest yet no place shows the slend’rest prints,"
4371,E.,"The rugged shore so bristled is with flints,"
4372,E.,"Against which ev’ry way the waves so flock,"
4373,E.,"And all the shore shows as one eminent rock,"
4374,E.,"So near which ’tis so deep, that not a sand"
4375,E.,"Is there for any tired foot to stand,"
4376,E.,"Nor fly his death-fast-following miseries,"
4377,E.,"Lest, if he land, upon him foreright flies"
4378,E.,"A churlish wave, to crush him ’gainst a cliff,"
4379,E.,Worse than vain rend’ring all his landing strife.
4380,E.,"And should I swim to seek a hav’n elsewhere,"
4381,E.,"Or land less way-beat, I may justly fear"
4382,E.,"I shall be taken with a gale again,"
4383,E.,And cast a huge way off into the main;
4384,E.,And there the great Earth-shaker (having seen
4385,E.,"My so near landing, and again his spleen"
4386,E.,"Forcing me to him) will some whale send out,"
4387,E.,(Of which a horrid number here about
4388,E.,His Amphitrite breeds) to swallow me.
4389,E.,"I well have prov’d, with what malignity"
4390,E.,"He treads my steps.” While this discourse he held,"
4391,E.,A curs’d surge ’gainst a cutting rock impell’d
4392,E.,"His naked body, which it gash’d and tore,"
4393,E.,"And had his bones broke, if but one sea more"
4394,E.,"Had cast him on it. But She prompted him,"
4395,E.,"That never fail’d, and bade him no more swim"
4396,E.,"Still off and on, but boldly force the shore,"
4397,E.,And hug the rock that him so rudely tore;
4398,E.,"Which he with both hands sigh’d and clasp’d, till past"
4399,E.,"The billow’s rage was; when ’scap’d, back so fast"
4400,E.,"The rock repuls’d it, that it reft his hold,"
4401,E.,"Sucking him from it, and far back he roll’d"
4402,E.,And as the polypus that (forc’d from home
4403,E.,"Amidst the soft sea, and near rough land come"
4404,E.,For shelter ’gainst the storms that beat on her
4405,E.,"At open sea, as she abroad doth err)"
4406,E.,"A deal of gravel, and sharp little stones,"
4407,E.,Needfully gathers in her hollow bones;
4408,E.,"So he forc’d hither by the sharper ill,"
4409,E.,"Shunning the smoother, where he best hop’d, still"
4410,E.,"The worst succeeded; for the cruel friend,"
4411,E.,"To which he cling’d for succour, off did rend"
4412,E.,From his broad hands the soaken flesh so sore
4413,E.,"That off he fell, and could sustain no more."
4414,E.,"Quite under water fell he; and, past fate,"
4415,E.,Hapless Ulysses there had lost the state
4416,E.,"He held in life, if, still the grey-eyed Maid"
4417,E.,"His wisdom prompting, he had not assay’d"
4418,E.,"Another course, and ceas’d t’ attempt that shore,"
4419,E.,"Swimming, and casting round his eye t’ explore"
4420,E.,Some other shelter. Then the mouth he found
4421,E.,"Of fair Callicoe’s flood, whose shores were crown’d"
4422,E.,With most apt succours: rocks so smooth they seem’d
4423,E.,Polish’d of purpose; land that quite redeem’d
4424,E.,With breathless coverts th’ others’ blasted shores.
4425,E.,"The flood he knew, and thus in heart implores:"
4426,E.,"“King of this river, hear! Whatever name"
4427,E.,"Makes thee invok’d, to thee I humbly frame"
4428,E.,My flight from Neptune’s furies. Rev’rend is
4429,E.,To all the ever-living Deities
4430,E.,What erring man soever seeks their aid.
4431,E.,To thy both flood and knees a man dismay’d
4432,E.,With varied suff’rance sues. Yield then some rest
4433,E.,To him that is thy suppliant profest.”
4434,E.,"This, though but spoke in thought, the Godhead heard,"
4435,E.,"Her current straight stay’d, and her thick waves clear’d"
4436,E.,"Before him, smooth’d her waters, and, just where"
4437,E.,"He pray’d half-drown’d, entirely sav’d him there."
4438,E.,"Then forth he came, his both knees falt’ring, both"
4439,E.,"His strong hands hanging down, and all with froth"
4440,E.,"His cheeks and nosthrils flowing, voice and breath"
4441,E.,"Spent to all use, and down he sunk to death."
4442,E.,The sea had soak’d his heart through; all his veins
4443,E.,His toils had rack’d t’ a labouring woman’s pains.[5]
4444,E.,Dead weary was he. But when breath did find
4445,E.,"A pass reciprocal, and in his mind"
4446,E.,"His spirit was recollected, up he rose,"
4447,E.,"And from his neck did th’ amulet unloose,"
4448,E.,That Ino gave him; which he hurl’d from him
4449,E.,"To sea. It sounding fell, and back did swim"
4450,E.,"With th’ ebbing waters, till it straight arriv’d"
4451,E.,Where Ino’s fair hand it again receiv’d.
4452,E.,"Then kiss’d he th’ humble earth; and on he goes,"
4453,E.,"Till bulrushes show’d place for his repose,"
4454,E.,"Where laid, he sigh’d, and thus said to his soul:"
4455,E.,"“O me, what strange perplexities control"
4456,E.,The whole skill of thy pow’rs in this event!
4457,E.,What feel I? If till care-nurse night be spent
4458,E.,"I watch amidst the flood, the sea’s chill breath,"
4459,E.,"And vegetant dews, I fear will be my death,"
4460,E.,So low brought with my labours. Towards day
4461,E.,A passing sharp air ever breathes at sea.
4462,E.,"If I the pitch of this next mountain scale,"
4463,E.,"And shady wood, and in some thicket fall"
4464,E.,"Into the hands of Sleep, though there the cold"
4465,E.,"May well be check’d, and healthful slumbers hold"
4466,E.,"Her sweet hand on my pow’rs, all care allay’d,"
4467,E.,Yet there will beasts devour me. Best appaid
4468,E.,"Doth that course make me yet; for there, some strife,"
4469,E.,"Strength, and my spirit, may make me make for life;"
4470,E.,"Which, though impair’d, may yet be fresh applied,"
4471,E.,Where peril possible of escape is tried.
4472,E.,"But he that fights with heav’n, or with the sea,"
4473,E.,To indiscretion adds impiety.”
4474,E.,Thus to the woods he hasted; which he found
4475,E.,"Not far from sea, but on far-seeing ground,"
4476,E.,"Where two twin underwoods he enter’d on,"
4477,E.,With olive-trees and oil-trees overgrown;
4478,E.,Through which the moist force of the loud-voic’d wind
4479,E.,"Did never beat, nor ever Phœbus shin’d,"
4480,E.,"Nor show’r beat through, they grew so one in one,"
4481,E.,"And had, by turns, their pow’r t’ exclude the sun."
4482,E.,Here enter’d our Ulysses; and a bed
4483,E.,"Of leaves huge, and of huge abundance, spread"
4484,E.,"With all his speed. Large he made it, for there"
4485,E.,"For two or three men ample cov’rings were,"
4486,E.,"Such as might shield them from the winter’s worst,"
4487,E.,"Though steel it breathed, and blew as it would burst.[6]"
4488,E.,"Patient Ulysses joy’d, that ever day"
4489,E.,"Show’d such a shelter. In the midst he lay,"
4490,E.,Store of leaves heaping high on ev’ry side.
4491,E.,And as in some out-field a man doth hide
4492,E.,"A kindled brand, to keep the seed of fire,"
4493,E.,"No neighbour dwelling near, and his desire"
4494,E.,"Serv’d with self store, he else would ask of none,"
4495,E.,But of his fore-spent sparks rakes th’ ashes on;
4496,E.,"So this out-place Ulysses thus receives,"
4497,E.,And thus nak’d virtue’s seed lies hid in leaves.
4498,E.,Yet Pallas made him sleep as soon as men
4499,E.,"Whom delicacies all their flatt’ries deign,"
4500,E.,And all that all his labours could comprise
4501,E.,Quickly concluded in his closed eyes.

4636,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To wear fair weeds, as ev’ry man that sits"
4637,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In place of council. And five sons you have,"
4638,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Two wed, three bachelors, that must be brave"
4639,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In ev’ry day’s shift, that they may go dance;"
4640,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For these three last with these things must advance
4641,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their states in marriage, and who else but I,"
4642,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their sister, should their dancing rites supply?”"
4643,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This gen’ral cause she show’d, and would not name"
4644,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her mind of nuptials to her sire, for shame."
4645,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He understood her yet, and thus replied:"
4646,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Daughter! nor these, nor any grace beside,"
4647,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I either will deny thee, or defer,"
4648,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mules, nor a coach, of state and circular,"
4649,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fitting at all parts. Go, my servants shall"
4650,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Serves thy desires, and thy command in all.”"
4651,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The servants then commanded soon obey’d,"
4652,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fetch’d coach, and mules join’d in it. Then the Maid"
4653,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Brought from the chamber her rich weeds, and laid"
4654,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All up in coach; in which her mother plac’d
4655,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A maund of victuals, varied well in taste,"
4656,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And other junkets. Wine she likewise fill’d
4657,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Within a goat-skin bottle, and distill’d"
4658,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sweet and moist oil into a golden cruse,"
4659,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both for her daughter’s, and her handmaid’s, use,"
4660,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To soften their bright bodies, when they rose"
4661,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Cleans’d from their cold baths. Up to coach then goes
4662,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Th’ observéd Maid, takes both the scourge and reins,"
4663,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And to her side her handmaid straight attains.
4664,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor these alone, but other virgins, grac’d"
4665,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The nuptial chariot. The whole bevy plac’d,"
4666,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nausicaa scourg’d to make the coach-mules run,"
4667,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That neigh’d, and pac’d their usual speed, and soon"
4668,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both maids and weeds brought to the river-side,"
4669,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where baths for all the year their use supplied,"
4670,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose waters were so pure they would not stain,"
4671,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But still ran fair forth, and did more remain"
4672,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Apt to purge stains, for that purg’d stain within,"
4673,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which by the water’s pure store was not seen.
4674,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These, here arriv’d, the mules uncoach’d, and drave"
4675,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up to the gulfy river’s shore, that gave"
4676,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Sweet grass to them. The maids from coach then took
4677,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their clothes, and steep’d them in the sable brook:"
4678,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then put them into springs, and trod them clean"
4679,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With cleanly feet; adventuring wagers then
4680,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Who should have soonest and most cleanly done.
4681,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When having thoroughly cleans’d, they spread them on"
4682,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The flood’s shore, all in order. And then, where"
4683,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The waves the pebbles wash’d, and ground was clear,"
4684,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They bath’d themselves, and all with glitt’ring oil"
4685,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Smooth’d their white skins; refreshing then their toil
4686,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With pleasant dinner, by the river-side;"
4687,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Yet still watch’d when the sun their clothes had dried.
4688,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Till which time, having din’d, Nausicaa"
4689,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With other virgins did at stool-ball play,"
4690,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their shoulder-reaching head-tires laying by.
4691,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nausicaa, with the wrists of ivory,"
4692,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The liking stroke struck, singing first a song,"
4693,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As custom order’d, and amidst the throng"
4694,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made such a show, and so past all was seen,"
4695,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As when the chaste-born, arrow-loving, Queen,"
4696,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Along the mountains gliding, either over"
4697,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Spartan Taygetus, whose tops far discover,"
4698,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or Eurymanthus, in the wild boar’s chace,"
4699,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or swift-hov’d hart, and with her Jove’s fair race,"
4700,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The field Nymphs, sporting; amongst whom, to see"
4701,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"How far Diana had priority,"
4702,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though all were fair, for fairness yet of all,"
4703,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As both by head and forehead being more tall,"
4704,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Latona triumph’d, since the dullest sight"
4705,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Might eas’ly judge whom her pains brought to light;
4706,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nausicaa so, whom never husband tam’d,"
4707,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Above them all in all the beauties flam’d.
4708,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But when they now made homewards, and array’d,"
4709,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ord’ring their weeds disorder’d as they play’d,"
4710,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mules and coach ready, then Minerva thought"
4711,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What means to wake Ulysses might be wrought,"
4712,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That he might see this lovely-sighted maid,"
4713,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom she intended should become his aid,"
4714,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bring him to town, and his return advance."
4715,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her mean was this, though thought a stool-ball chance:[4]"
4716,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The queen now, for the upstroke, struck the ball"
4717,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Quite wide off th’ other maids, and made it fall"
4718,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amidst the whirlpools. At which out shriek’d all,"
4719,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And with the shriek did wise Ulysses wake;
4720,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who, sitting up, was doubtful who should make"
4721,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That sudden outcry, and in mind thus striv’d:"
4722,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“On what a people am I now arriv’d?
4723,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At civil hospitable men, that fear"
4724,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Gods? Or dwell injurious mortals here?
4725,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Unjust, and churlish? Like the female cry"
4726,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of youth it sounds. What are they? Nymphs bred high
4727,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On tops of hills, or in the founts of floods,"
4728,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In herby marshes, or in leafy woods?"
4729,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or are they high-spoke men I now am near?
4730,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I’ll prove, and see.” With this, the wary peer"
4731,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Crept forth the thicket, and an olive bough"
4732,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Broke with his broad hand, which he did bestow"
4733,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In covert of his nakedness, and then"
4734,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Put hasty head out. Look how from his den
4735,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A mountain lion looks, that, all embrued"
4736,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With drops of trees, and weather-beaten-hued,"
4737,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bold of his strength, goes on, and in his eye"
4738,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A burning furnace glows, all bent to prey"
4739,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On sheep, or oxen, or the upland hart,"
4740,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His belly charging him, and he must part"
4741,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stakes with the herdsman in his beasts’ attempt,"
4742,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ev’n where from rape their strengths are most exempt;
4743,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So wet, so weather-beat, so stung with need,"
4744,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ev’n to the home-fields of the country’s breed
4745,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses was to force forth his access,"
4746,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Though merely naked; and his sight did press
4747,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The eyes of soft-hair’d virgins. Horrid was
4748,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His rough appearance to them; the hard pass
4749,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He had at sea stuck by him. All in flight
4750,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The virgins scatter’d, frighted with this sight,"
4751,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About the prominent windings of the flood.
4752,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All but Nausicaa fled; but she fast stood,"
4753,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pallas had put a boldness in her breast,"
4754,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And in her fair limbs tender fear comprest.
4755,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And still she stood him, as resolv’d to know"
4756,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What man he was, or out of what should grow"
4757,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His strange repair to them. And here was he
4758,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Put to his wisdom; if her virgin knee
4759,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He should be bold, but kneeling, to embrace,"
4760,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or keep aloof, and try with words of grace,"
4761,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In humblest suppliance, if he might obtain"
4762,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some cover for his nakedness, and gain"
4763,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her grace to show and guide him to the town.
4764,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The last he best thought, to be worth his own,"
4765,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In weighing both well; to keep still aloof,"
4766,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And give with soft words his desires their proof,"
4767,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lest, pressing so near as to touch her knee,"
4768,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He might incense her maiden modesty.
4769,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This fair and fil’d speech then shew’d this was he:
4770,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Let me beseech, O queen, this truth of thee,"
4771,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Are you of mortal, or the defied, race?"
4772,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If of the Gods, that th’ ample heav’ns embrace,"
4773,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I can resemble you to none above
4774,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So near as to the chaste-born birth of Jove,"
4775,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The beamy Cynthia. Her you full present,"
4776,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In grace of ev’ry God-like lineament,"
4777,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her goodly magnitude, and all th’ address"
4778,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,You promise of her very perfectness.
4779,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If sprung of humans, that inhabit earth,"
4780,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thrice blest are both the authors of your birth,"
4781,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thrice blest your brothers, that in your deserts"
4782,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Must, ev’n to rapture, bear delighted hearts,"
4783,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To see, so like the first trim of a tree,"
4784,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your form adorn a dance. But most blest he,"
4785,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all that breathe, that hath the gift t’ engage"
4786,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your bright neck in the yoke of marriage,"
4787,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And deck his house with your commanding merit
4788,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I have not seen a man of so much spirit,"
4789,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor man, nor woman, I did ever see,"
4790,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,At all parts equal to the parts in thee.
4791,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"T’ enjoy your sight, doth admiration seize"
4792,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My eyes, and apprehensive faculties."
4793,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Lately in Delos (with a charge of men
4794,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Arriv’d, that render’d me most wretched then,"
4795,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Now making me thus naked) I beheld
4796,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The burthen of a palm, whose issue swell’d"
4797,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About Apollo’s fane, and that put on"
4798,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A grace like thee; for Earth had never none
4799,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all her sylvan issue so adorn’d.
4800,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Into amaze my very soul was turn’d,"
4801,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To give it observation; as now thee
4802,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To view, O virgin, a stupidity"
4803,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Past admiration strikes me, join’d with fear"
4804,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To do a suppliant’s due, and press so near,"
4805,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As to embrace thy knees. Nor is it strange,"
4806,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For one of fresh and firmest spirit would change
4807,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"T’ embrace so bright an object. But, for me,"
4808,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A cruel habit of calamity
4809,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Prepar’d the strong impression thou hast made;
4810,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For this last day did fly night’s twentieth shade
4811,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since I, at length, escap’d the sable seas;"
4812,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When in the mean time th’ unrelenting prease
4813,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of waves and stern storms toss’d me up and down,"
4814,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From th’ isle Ogygia. And now God hath thrown
4815,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My wrack on this shore, that perhaps I may"
4816,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My mis’ries vary here; for yet their stay,"
4817,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I fear, Heav’n hath not order’d, though, before"
4818,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These late afflictions, it hath lent me store."
4819,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O queen, deign pity then, since first to you"
4820,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My fate importunes my distress to vow.
4821,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No other dame, nor man, that this Earth own,"
4822,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And neighbour city, I have seen or known."
4823,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The town then show me; give my nakedness
4824,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some shroud to shelter it, if to these seas"
4825,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Linen or woollen you have brought to cleanse.
4826,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"God give you, in requital, all th’ amends"
4827,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your heart can wish, a husband, family,"
4828,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And good agreement. Nought beneath the sky
4829,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"More sweet, more worthy is, than firm consent"
4830,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of man and wife in household government.
4831,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It joys their wishers-well, their enemies wounds,"
4832,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But to themselves the special good redounds.”
4833,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,She answer’d: “Stranger! I discern in thee
4834,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor sloth, nor folly, reigns; and yet I see"
4835,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Th’ art poor and wretched. In which I conclude,"
4836,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That industry nor wisdom make endued
4837,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Men with those gifts that make them best to th’ eye;
4838,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Jove only orders man’s felicity.
4839,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To good and bad his pleasure fashions still
4840,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The whole proportion of their good and ill.
4841,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And he, perhaps, hath form’d this plight in thee,"
4842,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of which thou must be patient, as he free."
4843,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But after all thy wand’rings, since thy way,"
4844,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both to our earth, and near our city, lay,"
4845,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As being expos’d to our cares to relieve,"
4846,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Weeds, and what else a human hand should give"
4847,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To one so suppliant and tam’d with woe,"
4848,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou shalt not want. Our city I will show,"
4849,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And tell our people’s name: This neighbour town,"
4850,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all this kingdom, the Phæacians own."
4851,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And (since thou seem’dst so fain to know my birth,"
4852,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And mad’st a question, if of heav’n or earth.)"
4853,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This earth hath bred me; and my father’s name
4854,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Alcinous is, that in the pow’r and frame"
4855,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of this isle’s rule is supereminent.”
4856,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus, passing him, she to the virgins went,"
4857,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And said: “Give stay both to your feet and fright.
4858,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Why thus disperse ye for a man’s mere sight?
4859,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Esteem you him a Cyclop, that long since"
4860,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Made use to prey upon our citizens?
4861,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This man no moist man is, (nor wat’rish thing,[5]"
4862,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That’s ever flitting, ever ravishing"
4863,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All it can compass; and, like it, doth range"
4864,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In rape of women, never stay’d in change)."
4865,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This man is truly manly, wise, and stay’d,[6]"
4866,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In soul more rich the more to sense decay’d,"
4867,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who nor will do, nor suffer to be done,"
4868,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Acts lewd and abject; nor can such a one
4869,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Greet the Phæacians with a mind envíous,"
4870,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dear to the Gods they are, and he is pious,"
4871,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Besides, divided from the world we are,"
4872,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The out-part of it, billows circular"
4873,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The sea revolving round about our shore;
4874,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor is there any man that enters more
4875,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Than our own countrymen, with what is brought"
4876,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From other countries. This man, minding nought"
4877,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But his relief, a poor unhappy wretch,"
4878,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wrack’d here, and hath no other land to fetch,"
4879,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Him now we must provide for. From Jove come[7]
4880,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All strangers, and the needy of a home,"
4881,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who any gift, though ne’er so small it be,"
4882,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Esteem as great, and take it gratefully."
4883,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore, virgins, give the stranger food,"
4884,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And wine; and see ye bathe him in the flood,"
4885,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Near to some shore to shelter most inclin’d.
4886,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"_To cold-bath-bathers hurtful is the wind,_"
4887,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not only rugged making th’ outward skin,"
4888,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But by his thin pow’rs pierceth parts within.’
4889,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, their flight in a return they set,"
4890,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And did Ulysses with all grace entreat,"
4891,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Show’d him a shore, wind-proof, and full of shade,"
4892,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By him a shirt and utter mantle laid,"
4893,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A golden jug of liquid oil did add,"
4894,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bad wash, and all things as Nausicaa bad."
4895,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Divine Ulysses would not use their aid;
4896,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But thus bespake them: “Ev’ry lovely maid,"
4897,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let me entreat to stand a little by,[8]"
4898,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That I, alone, the fresh flood may apply"
4899,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To cleanse my bosom of the sea-wrought brine,"
4900,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then use oil, which long time did not shine"
4901,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,On my poor shoulders. I’ll not wash in sight
4902,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of fair-hair’d maidens. I should blush outright,"
4903,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To bathe all-bare by such a virgin light.”
4904,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They mov’d, and mus’d a man had so much grace,"
4905,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And told their mistress what a man he was.
4906,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He cleans’d his broad soil’d shoulders, back, and head"
4907,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet never tam’d, but now had foam and weed"
4908,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Knit in the fair curls. Which dissolv’d, and he"
4909,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Slick’d all with sweet oil, the sweet charity"
4910,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The untouch’d virgin show’d in his attire
4911,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He cloth’d him with. Then Pallas put a fire,"
4912,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"More than before, into his sparkling eyes,"
4913,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His late soil set off with his soon fresh guise.
4914,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His locks, cleans’d, curl’d the more, and match’d, in pow’r"
4915,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To please an eye, the hyacinthian flow’r."
4916,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as a workman, that can well combine"
4917,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Silver and gold, and make both strive to shine,"
4918,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As being by Vulcan, and Minerva too,"
4919,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Taught how far either may be urg’d to go
4920,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In strife of eminence, when work sets forth"
4921,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A worthy soul to bodies of such worth,"
4922,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No thought reproving th’ act, in any place,"
4923,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor Art no debt to Nature’s liveliest grace;
4924,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So Pallas wrought in him a grace as great
4925,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From head to shoulders, and ashore did seat"
4926,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His goodly presence. To which such a guise
4927,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He show’d in going, that it ravish’d eyes."
4928,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All which continued, as he sat apart,"
4929,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nausicaa’s eye struck wonder through her heart,"
4930,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who thus bespake her consorts: “Hear me, you"
4931,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fair-wristed virgins! This rare man, I know,"
4932,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Treads not our country-earth, against the will"
4933,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of some God thronéd on th’ Olympian hill.
4934,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He show’d to me, till now, not worth the note,"
4935,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But now he looks as he had godhead got.
4936,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I would to heav’n my husband were no worse,"
4937,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And would be call’d no better, but the course"
4938,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of other husbands pleas’d to dwell out here.
4939,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Observe and serve him with our utmost cheer.”
4940,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She said, they heard and did. He drunk and eat"
4941,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like to a harpy, having touch’d no meat"
4942,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A long before time. But Nausicaa now
4943,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thought of the more grace she did lately vow,"
4944,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had horse to chariot join’d, and up she rose,"
4945,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up cheer’d her guest, and said: “Guest, now dispose"
4946,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yourself for town, that I may let you see"
4947,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My father’s court, where all the peers will be"
4948,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of our Phæacian state. At all parts, then,"
4949,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Observe to whom and what place y’ are t’ attain;
4950,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though I need usher you with no advice,"
4951,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since I suppose you absolutely wise.
4952,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"While we the fields pass, and men’s labours there,"
4953,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So long, in these maids’ guides, directly bear"
4954,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Upon my chariot (I must go before
4955,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For cause that after comes, to which this more"
4956,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Be my induction) you shall then soon end
4957,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your way to town, whose tow’rs you see ascend[9]"
4958,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To such a steepness. On whose either side
4959,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A fair port stands, to which is nothing wide"
4960,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,An ent’rer’s passage; on whose both hands ride
4961,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ships in fair harbours; which once past, you win"
4962,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The goodly market-place (that circles in
4963,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A fane to Neptune, built of curious stone,"
4964,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And passing ample) where munitión,"
4965,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Gables, and masts, men make, and polish’d oars;"
4966,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For the Phæacians are not conquerors
4967,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By bows nor quivers; oars, masts, ships they are"
4968,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With which they plough the sea, and wage their war."
4969,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And now the cause comes why I lead the way,"
4970,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not taking you to coach: The men, that sway"
4971,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In work of those tools that so fit our state,"
4972,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Are rude mechanicals, that rare and late"
4973,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Work in the market-place; and those are they
4974,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose bitter tongues I shun, who straight would say"
4975,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(For these vile vulgars are extremely proud,"
4976,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And foully-languag’d) ‘What is he, allow’d"
4977,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To coach it with Nausicaa, so large set,"
4978,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And fairly fashion’d? Where were these two met?
4979,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He shall be sure her husband. She hath been

5314,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Made ripe betimes; here grew another green.
5315,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Here some were gath’ring, here some pressing, seen."
5316,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A large-allotted sev’ral each fruit had;
5317,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all th’ adorn’d grounds their appearance made
5318,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In flow’r and fruit, at which the king did aim"
5319,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To the precisest order he could claim.
5320,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Two fountains grac’d the garden; of which, one"
5321,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Pour’d out a winding stream that over-run
5322,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The grounds for their use chiefly, th’ other went"
5323,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Close by the lofty palace gate, and lent"
5324,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The city his sweet benefit. And thus
5325,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Gods the court deck’d of Alcinous.
5326,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Patient Ulysses stood a while at gaze,"
5327,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, having all observ’d, made instant pace"
5328,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Into the court; where all the peers he found,"
5329,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And captains of Phæacia, with cups-crown’d"
5330,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Off’ring to sharp-eyed Hermes, to whom last"
5331,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They us’d to sacrifice, when sleep had cast"
5332,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His inclination through their thoughts. But these
5333,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses pass’d, and forth went; nor their eyes"
5334,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Took note of him, for Pallas stopp’d the light"
5335,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With mists about him, that, unstay’d, he might"
5336,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"First to Alcinous, and Arete,"
5337,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Present his person; and, of both them, she,"
5338,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By Pallas’ counsel, was to have the grace"
5339,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of foremost greeting. Therefore his embrace
5340,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He cast about her knee. And then off flew
5341,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The heav’nly air that hid him. When his view
5342,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With silence and with admiration strook
5343,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The court quite through; but thus he silence broke:
5344,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Divine Rhexenor’s offspring, Arete,"
5345,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To thy most honour’d husband, and to thee,"
5346,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A man whom many labours have distrest
5347,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is come for comfort, and to ev’ry guest."
5348,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all whom heav’n vouchsafe delightsome lives,"
5349,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And after to your issue that survives
5350,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A good resignment of the goods ye leave,"
5351,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With all the honour that yourselves receive
5352,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amongst your people. Only this of me
5353,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Is the ambition; that I may but see
5354,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(By your vouchsaf’d means, and betimes vouchsaf’d)"
5355,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My country-earth; since I have long been left
5356,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To labours, and to errors, barr’d from end,"
5357,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And far from benefit of any friend,”"
5358,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He said no more, but left them dumb with that,"
5359,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Went to the hearth, and in the ashes sat,"
5360,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Aside the fire. At last their silence brake,"
5361,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Echinëus, th’ old heroë, spake;"
5362,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A man that all Phæacians pass’d in years,"
5363,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And in persuasive eloquence all the peers,"
5364,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Knew much, and us’d it well; and thus spake he:"
5365,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Alcinous! It shews not decently,"
5366,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor doth your honour what you see admit,"
5367,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That this your guest should thus abjectly sit,"
5368,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His chair the earth, the hearth his cushion,"
5369,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ashes as if appos’d for food. A throne,"
5370,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Adorn’d with due rites, stands you more in hand"
5371,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To see his person plac’d in, and command"
5372,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That instantly your heralds fill-in wine,"
5373,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That to the God that doth in lightnings shine
5374,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We may do sacrifice; for he is there,"
5375,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Where these his rev’rend suppliants appear.
5376,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let what you have within be brought abroad,"
5377,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To sup the stranger. All these would have show’d
5378,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This fit respect to him, but that they stay"
5379,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For your precedence, that should grace the way.”"
5380,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When this had added to the well-inclin’d
5381,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And sacred order of Alcinous’ mind,"
5382,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then of the great-in-wit the hand he seis’d,"
5383,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And from the ashes his fair person rais’d,"
5384,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Advanc’d him to a well-adornéd throne,"
5385,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And from his seat rais’d his most lovéd son,"
5386,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Laodamas, that next himself was set,"
5387,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To give him place. The handmaid then did get
5388,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"An ewer of gold, with water fill’d, which plac’d"
5389,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon a caldron, all with silver grac’d,"
5390,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,She pour’d out on their hands. And then was spread
5391,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A table, which the butler set with bread,"
5392,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As others serv’d with other food the board,"
5393,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In all the choice the present could afford.
5394,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ulysses meat and wine took; and then thus
5395,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The king the herald call’d: “Pontonous!
5396,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Serve wine through all the house, that all may pay"
5397,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rites to the Lightner, who is still in way"
5398,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With humble suppliants, and them pursues"
5399,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With all benign and hospitable dues.”
5400,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pontonous gave act to all he will’d,"
5401,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And honey-sweetness-giving-minds wine fill’d,[6]"
5402,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Disposing it in cups for all to drink.
5403,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All having drunk what either’s heart could think
5404,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fit for due sacrifice, Alcinous said:"
5405,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Hear me, ye dukes that the Phæacians lead,"
5406,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And you our counsellors, that I may now"
5407,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Discharge the charge my mind suggests to you,"
5408,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For this our guest: Feast past, and this night’s sleep,"
5409,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Next morn, our senate summon’d, we will keep"
5410,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Justs, sacred to the Gods, and this our guest"
5411,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Receive in solemn court with fitting feast;
5412,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then think of his return, that, under hand"
5413,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of our deduction, his natural land"
5414,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Without more toil or care, and with delight,"
5415,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And that soon giv’n him, how far-hence dissite"
5416,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Soever it can be) he may ascend;
5417,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And in the mean time without wrong attend,"
5418,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or other want, fit means to that ascent.[7]"
5419,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What, after, austere Fates shall make th’ event"
5420,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his life’s thread, now spinning, and began"
5421,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When his pain’d mother freed his root of man,"
5422,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He must endure in all kinds. If some God
5423,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Perhaps abides with us in his abode,"
5424,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And other things will think upon than we,"
5425,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Gods’ wills stand, who ever yet were free"
5426,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of their appearance to us, when to them"
5427,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We offer’d hecatombs of fit esteem,"
5428,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And would at feast sit with us, ev’n where we"
5429,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Order’d our session. They would likewise be
5430,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Encount’rers of us, when in way alone"
5431,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About his fit affairs went any one.
5432,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor let them cloak themselves in any care
5433,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To do us comfort, we as near them are,"
5434,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As are the Cyclops, or the impious race[8]"
5435,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of earthy giants, that would heav’n outface.”"
5436,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ulysses answer’d: “Let some other doubt
5437,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Employ your thoughts than what your words give out,"
5438,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which intimate a kind of doubt that I
5439,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Should shadow in this shape a Deity.
5440,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I bear no such least semblance, or in wit,"
5441,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Virtue, or person. What may well befit"
5442,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One of those mortals, whom you chiefly know"
5443,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Bears up and down the burthen of the woe
5444,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Appropriate to poor man, give that to me;"
5445,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of whose moans I sit in the most degree,"
5446,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And might say more, sustaining griefs that all"
5447,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Gods consent to; no one ’twixt their fall
5448,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And my unpitied shoulders letting down
5449,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The least diversion. Be the grace then shown,"
5450,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To let me taste your free-giv’n food in peace.
5451,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,_Through greatest grief the belly must have ease;
5452,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Worse than an envious belly nothing is._
5453,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It will command his strict necessities,"
5454,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of men most griev’d in body or in mind,"
5455,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That are in health, and will not give their kind"
5456,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A desp’rate wound. When most with cause I grieve,"
5457,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It bids me still, Eat, man, and drink, and live;"
5458,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And this makes all forgot. Whatever ill
5459,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I ever bear, it ever bids me fill."
5460,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But this ease is but forc’d, and will not last,"
5461,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Till what the mind likes be as well embrac’d;
5462,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And therefore let me wish you would partake
5463,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In your late purpose; when the morn shall make
5464,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her next appearance, deign me but the grace,"
5465,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Unhappy man, that I may once embrace"
5466,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My country-earth. Though I be still thrust at
5467,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By ancient ills, yet make me but see that."
5468,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then let life go, when withal I see"
5469,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My high-roof’d large house, lands, and family.”"
5470,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This all approv’d; and each will’d ev’ry one,"
5471,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since he hath said so fairly, set him gone."
5472,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Feast past and sacrifice, to sleep all vow"
5473,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their eyes at either’s house. Ulysses now
5474,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was left here with Alcinous, and his Queen,"
5475,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The all-lov’d Arete. The handmaids then
5476,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The vessel of the banquet took away.
5477,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When Arete set eye on his array;
5478,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Knew both his out and under weed, which she"
5479,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Made with her maids; and mus’d by what means he
5480,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Obtain’d their wearing; which she made request
5481,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To know, and wings gave to these speeches: “Guest!"
5482,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"First let me ask, what, and from whence you are?"
5483,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then, who grac’d you with the weeds you wear?"
5484,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Said you not lately, you had err’d at seas,"
5485,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And thence arriv’d here?” Laertiades
5486,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To this thus answer’d: “’Tis a pain, O Queen,"
5487,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Still to be op’ning wounds wrought deep, and green,"
5488,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of which the Gods have open’d store in me;
5489,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet your will must be serv’d. Far hence, at sea,"
5490,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There lies an isle, that bears Ogygia’s name,"
5491,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where Atlas’ daughter, the ingenious dame,"
5492,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fair-hair’d Calypso lives; a Goddess grave,"
5493,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And with whom men nor Gods society have;
5494,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet I, past man unhappy, liv’d alone,"
5495,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By Heav’n’s wrath forc’d, her house-companion."
5496,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For Jove had with a fervent lightning cleft
5497,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My ship in twain, and far at black sea left"
5498,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Me and my soldiers; all whose lives I lost.
5499,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I in mine arms the keel took, and was tost"
5500,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nine days together up from wave to wave.
5501,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The tenth grim night, the angry Deities drave"
5502,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Me and my wrack on th’ isle, in which doth dwell"
5503,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Dreadful Calypso; who exactly well
5504,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Receiv’d and nourish’d me, and promise made"
5505,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To make me deathless, nor should age invade"
5506,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My pow’rs with his deserts through all my days.
5507,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All mov’d not me, and therefore, on her stays,"
5508,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Sev’n years she made me lie; and there spent I
5509,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The long time, steeping in the misery"
5510,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of ceaseless tears the garments I did wear,"
5511,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From her fair hand. The eighth revolvéd year
5512,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Or by her chang’d mind, or by charge of Jove)"
5513,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She gave provok’d way to my wish’d remove,"
5514,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And in a many-jointed ship, with wine"
5515,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dainty in savour, bread, and weeds divine,"
5516,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sign’d, with a harmless and sweet wind, my pass."
5517,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then sev’nteen days at sea I homeward was,"
5518,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And by the eighteenth the dark hills appear’d
5519,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That your earth thrusts up. Much my heart was cheer’d,"
5520,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Unhappy man, for that was but a beam,"
5521,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To show I yet had agonies extreme
5522,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To put in suff’rance, which th’ Earth-shaker sent,"
5523,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Crossing my way with tempests violent,"
5524,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Unmeasur’d seas up-lifting, nor would give"
5525,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The billows leave to let my vessel live
5526,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The least time quiet, that ev’n sigh’d to bear"
5527,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their bitter outrage, which, at last, did tear"
5528,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her sides in pieces, set on by the winds."
5529,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I yet through-swum the waves that your shore binds,"
5530,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Till wind and water threw me up to it;
5531,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When, coming forth, a ruthless billow smit"
5532,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against huge rocks, and an accessless shore,"
5533,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My mangl’d body. Back again I bore,"
5534,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And swum till I was fall’n upon a flood,"
5535,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose shores, methought, on good advantage stood"
5536,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For my receipt, rock-free, and fenc’d from wind;"
5537,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And this I put for, gath’ring up my mind."
5538,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then the divine night came, and treading earth,"
5539,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Close by the flood that had from Jove her birth,"
5540,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Within a thicket I repos’d; when round
5541,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I ruffled up fall’n leaves in heap; and found,"
5542,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let fall from heav’n, a sleep interminate."
5543,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And here my heart, long time excruciate,"
5544,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the leaves I rested all that night,"
5545,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ev’n till the morning and meridian light.
5546,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sun declining then, delightsome sleep"
5547,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No longer laid my temples in his steep,"
5548,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But forth I went, and on the shore might see"
5549,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your daughter’s maids play. Like a Deity
5550,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She shin’d above them; and I pray’d to her,"
5551,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And she in disposition did prefer
5552,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Noblesse, and wisdom, no more low than might"
5553,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Become the goodness of a Goddess’ height.
5554,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor would you therefore hope, suppos’d distrest"
5555,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As I was then, and old, to find the least"
5556,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of any grace from her, being younger far."
5557,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,_With young folks Wisdom makes her commerce rare._
5558,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Yet she in all abundance did bestow
5559,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both wine, that makes the blood in humans grow,[9]"
5560,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And food, and bath’d me in the flood, and gave"
5561,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The weeds to me which now ye see me have.
5562,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This through my griefs I tell you, and ’tis true.”"
5563,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Alcinous answer’d: “Guest! my daughter knew
5564,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Least of what most you give her; nor became
5565,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The course she took, to let with ev’ry dame"
5566,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your person lackey; nor hath with them brought
5567,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Yourself home too; which first you had besought.”
5568,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O blame her not,” said he, “heroical lord,"
5569,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor let me hear against her worth a word.
5570,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She faultless is, and wish’d I would have gone"
5571,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all her women home, but I alone"
5572,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would venture my receipt here, having fear"
5573,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And rev’rend awe of accidents that were
5574,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of likely issue; both your wrath to move,"
5575,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And to inflame the common people’s love
5576,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of speaking ill, to which they soon give place."
5577,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,_We men are all a most suspicious race.”_
5578,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“My guest,” said he, “I use not to be stirr’d"
5579,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To wrath too rashly; and where are preferr’d
5580,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To men’s conceits things that may both ways fail,"
5581,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The noblest ever should the most prevail.
5582,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would Jove our Father, Pallas, and the Sun,"
5583,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, were you still as now, and could but run"
5584,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One fate with me, you would my daughter wed,"
5585,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And be my son-in-law, still vow’d to lead"
5586,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your rest of life here! I a house would give,"
5587,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And household goods, so freely you would live,"
5588,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Confin’d with us. But ’gainst your will shall none
5589,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Contain you here, since that were violence done"
5590,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Jove our Father. For your passage home,"
5591,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That you may well know we can overcome
5592,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So great a voyage, thus it shall succeed:"
5593,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To-morrow shall our men take all their heed,"
5594,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"While you securely sleep, to see the seas"
5595,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In calmest temper, and, if that will please,"
5596,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Show you your country and your house ere night,"
5597,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Though far beyond Eubœa be that sight.
5598,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And this Eubœa, as our subjects say"
5599,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That have been there and seen, is far away,"
5600,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Farthest from us of all the parts they know;
5601,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And made the trial when they help’d to row
5602,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The gold-lock’d Rhadamanth, to give him view"
5603,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of earth-born Tityus; whom their speeds did show
5604,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In that far-off Eubœa, the same day"
5605,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They set from hence; and home made good their way
5606,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With ease again, and him they did convey."
5607,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which I report to you, to let you see"
5608,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"How swift my ships are, and how matchlessly"
5609,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My young Phæacians with their oars prevail,"
5610,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To beat the sea through, and assist a sail.”"
5611,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This cheer’d Ulysses, who in private pray’d:"
5612,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“I would to Jove our Father, what he said,"
5613,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He could perform at all parts; he should then
5614,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Be glorified for ever, and I gain"
5615,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My natural country.” This discourse they had;
5616,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When fair-arm’d Arete her handmaids bad
5617,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A bed make in the portico, and ply"
5618,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With clothes, the cov’ring tapestry,"
5619,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The blankets purple; well-napp’d waistcoats too,"
5620,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To wear for more warmth. What these had to do,"
5621,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They torches took and did. The bed purvey’d,"
5622,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They mov’d Ulysses for his rest, and said:"
5623,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Come guest, your bed is fit, now frame to rest.”"
5624,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Motion of sleep was gracious to their guest;
5625,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which now he took profoundly, being laid"
5626,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Within a loop-hole tow’r, where was convey’d"
5627,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The sounding portico. The King took rest
5628,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In a retir’d part of the house; where drest
5629,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Queen her self a bed, and trundlebed,"
5630,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And by her lord repos’d her rev’rend head.

5704,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Council at the navy was design’d;

5768,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That troop’d up to the king’s capacious court,"
5769,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose porticos were chok’d with the resort,"
5770,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose walls were hung with men, young, old, thrust there"
5771,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In mighty concourse; for whose promis’d cheer
5772,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Alcinous slew twelve sheep, eight white-tooth’d swine,"
5773,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Two crook-haunch’d beeves; which flay’d and dress’d, divine"
5774,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The show was of so many a jocund guest,"
5775,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All set together at so set a feast.
5776,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To whose accomplish’d state the herald then
5777,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The lovely singer led; who past all mean
5778,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Muse affected, gave him good, and ill,"
5779,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His eyes put out, but put in soul at will."
5780,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His place was giv’n him in a chair all grac’d
5781,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With silver studs, and ’gainst a pillar plac’d:"
5782,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where, as the centre to the state, he rests,"
5783,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And round about the circle of the guests.
5784,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The herald on a pin above his head
5785,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His soundful harp hung, to whose height he led"
5786,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His hand for taking of it down at will,"
5787,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A board set by with food, and forth did fill"
5788,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A bowl of wine, to drink at his desire."
5789,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The rest then fell to feast, and, when the fire"
5790,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of appetite was quench’d, the Muse inflam’d"
5791,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The sacred singer. Of men highliest fam’d
5792,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He sung the glories, and a poem penn’d,"
5793,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That in applause did ample heav’n ascend.
5794,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose subject was, the stern Contentión"
5795,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Betwixt Ulysses and great Thetis’ son,"
5796,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As, at a banquet sacred to the Gods,"
5797,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In dreadful language they express’d their odds.
5798,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When Agamemnon sat rejoic’d in soul
5799,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To hear the Greek peers jar in terms so foul;
5800,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For augur Phœbus in presage had told
5801,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The King of men (desirous to unfold
5802,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The war’s perplex’d end, and being therefore gone"
5803,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In heav’nly Pythia to the porch of stone,)"
5804,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That then the end of all griefs should begin
5805,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"’Twixt Greece and Troy, when Greece (with strife to win"
5806,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That wish’d conclusion) in her kings should jar,"
5807,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And plead, if force or wit must end the war."
5808,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This brave Contention did the poet sing,"
5809,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Expressing so the spleen of either king,"
5810,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That his large purple weed Ulysses held
5811,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before his face and eyes, since thence distill’d"
5812,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tears uncontain’d; which he obscur’d, in fear"
5813,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To let th’ observing presence note a tear.
5814,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, when his sacred song the mere divine"
5815,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had giv’n an end, a goblet crown’d with wine"
5816,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, drying his wet eyes, did seize,[1]"
5817,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And sacrific’d to those Gods that would please
5818,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,T’ inspire the poet with a song so fit
5819,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To do him honour, and renown his wit."
5820,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His tears then stay’d. But when again began,"
5821,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By all the kings’ desires, the moving man,"
5822,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Again Ulysses could not choose but yield
5823,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To that soft passion, which again, withheld,"
5824,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He kept so cunningly from sight, that none,"
5825,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Except Alcinous himself alone,"
5826,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Discern’d him mov’d so much. But he sat next,"
5827,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And heard him deeply sigh; which his pretext
5828,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Could not keep hid from him. Yet he conceal’d
5829,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His utt’rance of it, and would have it held"
5830,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From all the rest, brake off the song, and this"
5831,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Said to those oar-affecting peers of his:
5832,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Princes, and peers! We now are satiate"
5833,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With sacred song that fits a feast of state,"
5834,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With wine and food. Now then to field, and try"
5835,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all kinds our approv’d activity,"
5836,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That this our guest may give his friends to know,"
5837,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his return, that we as little owe"
5838,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To fights and wrastlings, leaping, speed-of race,"
5839,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As these our court-rites; and commend our grace
5840,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all to all superior.” Forth he led,"
5841,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The peers and people troop’d up to their head.
5842,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor must Demodocus be left within;
5843,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose harp the herald hung upon the pin,"
5844,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His hand in his took, and abroad he brought"
5845,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The heav’nly poet, out the same way wrought"
5846,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That did the princes, and what they would see"
5847,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With admiration, with his company"
5848,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They wish’d to honour. To the place of game
5849,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These throng’d; and after routs of other came,"
5850,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all sort, infinite. Of youths that strove,"
5851,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Many and strong rose to their trial’s love.
5852,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up rose Acroneus, and Ocyalus,"
5853,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Elatreus, Prymneus, and Anchialus,[2]"
5854,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nauteus, Eretmeus, Thoen, Proreüs,"
5855,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pontëus, and the strong Amphialus"
5856,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Son to Tectonides Polyneüs.
5857,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up rose to these the great Euryalus,"
5858,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In action like the Homicide of War.
5859,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Naubolides, that was for person far"
5860,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Past all the rest, but one he could not pass,"
5861,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor any thought improve, Laodamas."
5862,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Up Anabesinëus then arose;
5863,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And three sons of the Sceptre-state, and those"
5864,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were Halius, the fore-prais’d Laodamas,"
5865,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And Clytonëus like a God in grace.
5866,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These first the foot-game tried, and from the lists"
5867,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Took start together. Up the dust in mists
5868,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They hurl’d about, as in their speed they flew;"
5869,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But Clytonëus first of all the crew
5870,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A stitch’s length in any fallow field
5871,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made good his pace; when, where the judges yield"
5872,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The prize and praise, his glorious speed arriv’d."
5873,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Next, for the boist’rous wrastling game they striv’d;"
5874,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,At which Euryalus the rest outshone.
5875,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At leap Amphialus, At the hollow stone"
5876,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Elatreüs excell’d. At buffets, last,"
5877,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Laodamas, the king’s fair son, surpast."
5878,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When all had striv’d in these assays their fill,"
5879,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Laodamas said: “Come friends, let’s prove what skill"
5880,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This stranger hath attain’d to in our sport.
5881,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Methinks, he must be of the active sort,"
5882,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His calves, thighs, hands, and well-knit shoulders show"
5883,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That Nature disposition did bestow
5884,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To fit with fact their form. Nor wants he prime.
5885,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But sour affliction, made a mate with time,"
5886,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Makes time the more seen. Nor imagine I,"
5887,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A worse thing to enforce debility
5888,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Than is the sea, though nature ne’er so strong"
5889,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Knits one together.” “Nor conceive you wrong,”"
5890,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Replied Euryalus, “but prove his blood"
5891,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With what you question.” In the midst then stood
5892,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Renown’d Laodamas, and prov’d him thus:"
5893,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Come, stranger-father, and assay with us"
5894,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your pow’rs in these contentions. If your show
5895,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Be answer’d with your worth, ’tis fit that you"
5896,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Should know these conflicts. Nor doth glory stand
5897,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On any worth more, in a man’s command,"
5898,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Than to be strenuous both of foot and hand.
5899,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Come then, make proof with us, discharge your mind"
5900,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of discontentments; for not far behind
5901,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Comes your deduction, ship is ready now,[3]"
5902,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And men, and all things.” “Why,” said he, “dost thou"
5903,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mock me, Laodamas, and these strifes bind"
5904,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My pow’rs to answer? I am more inclin’d
5905,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To cares than conflict. Much sustain’d I have,"
5906,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And still am suff’ring. I come here to crave,"
5907,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In your assemblies, means to be dismist,"
5908,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And pray both kings and subjects to assist.”
5909,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Euryalus an open brawl began,"
5910,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said: “I take you, sir, for no such man"
5911,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As fits these honour’d strifes. A number more
5912,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Strange men there are that I would choose before.
5913,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To one that loves to lie aship-board much,"
5914,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or is the prince of sailors; or to such
5915,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As traffic far and near, and nothing mind"
5916,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But freight, and passage, and a foreright wind;"
5917,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or to a victualler of a ship; or men
5918,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That set up all their pow’rs for rampant gain;
5919,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I can compare, or hold you like to be:"
5920,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, for a wrastler, or of quality"
5921,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fit for contentions noble, you abhor"
5922,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From worth of any such competitor.”
5923,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, frowning, answer’d: “Stranger, far"
5924,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy words are from the fashions regular
5925,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of kind, or honour. Thou art in thy guise"
5926,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Like to a man that authors injuries.[4]
5927,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I see, the Gods to all men give not all"
5928,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Manly addiction, wisdom, words that fall,"
5929,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like dice, upon the square still. Some man takes"
5930,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ill form from parents, but God often makes"
5931,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That fault of form up with observ’d repair
5932,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of pleasing speech, that makes him held for fair,"
5933,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That makes him speak securely, makes him shine"
5934,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In an assembly with a grace divine.
5935,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Men take delight to see how ev’nly lie
5936,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His words asteep in honey modesty.
5937,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Another, then, hath fashion like a God,"
5938,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But in his language he is foul and broad.
5939,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And such art thou. A person fair is giv’n,"
5940,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But nothing else is in thee sent from heav’n;
5941,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For in thee lurks a base and earthy soul,"
5942,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And t’ hast compell’d me, with a speech most foul,"
5943,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To be thus bitter. I am not unseen
5944,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In these fair strifes, as thy words overween,"
5945,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But in the first rank of the best I stand;
5946,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At least I did, when youth and strength of hand"
5947,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made me thus confident, but now am worn"
5948,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With woes and labours, as a human born"
5949,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To bear all anguish. Suffer’d much I have.
5950,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The war of men, and the inhuman wave,"
5951,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Have I driv’n through at all parts. But with all
5952,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My waste in suff’rance, what yet may fall"
5953,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In my performance, at these strifes I’ll try."
5954,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy speech hath mov’d, and made my wrath run high.”"
5955,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, with robe and all, he grasp’d a stone,"
5956,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A little graver than was ever thrown
5957,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By these Phæacians in their wrastling rout,"
5958,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"More firm, more massy; which, turn’d round about,"
5959,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He hurried from him with a hand so strong
5960,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It sung, and flew, and over all the throng,"
5961,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That at the others’ marks stood, quite it went;"
5962,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet down fell all beneath it, fearing spent"
5963,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The force that drave it flying from his hand,"
5964,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As it a dart were, or a walking wand;"
5965,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And far past all the marks of all the rest
5966,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His wing stole way; when Pallas straight imprest
5967,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A mark at fall of it, resembling then"
5968,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One of the navy-giv’n Phæacian men,"
5969,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thus advanc’d Ulysses: “One, though blind,"
5970,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O stranger, groping, may thy stone’s fall find,"
5971,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For not amidst the rout of marks it fell,"
5972,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But far before all. Of thy worth think well,"
5973,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And stand in all strifes. No Phæacian here
5974,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This bound can either better or come near.”
5975,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ulysses joy’d to hear that one man yet
5976,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Us’d him benignly, and would truth abet"
5977,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In those contentions; and then thus smooth
5978,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He took his speech down: “Reach me that now, youth,"
5979,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You shall, and straight I think, have one such more,"
5980,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And one beyond it too. And now, whose core"
5981,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stands sound and great within him, since ye have"
5982,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus put my spleen up, come again and brave"
5983,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The guest ye tempted, with such gross disgrace,"
5984,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At wrastling, buffets, whirlbat, speed o’ race;"
5985,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At all, or either, I except at none,"
5986,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But urge the whole state of you; only one,"
5987,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I will not challenge in my forced boast,"
5988,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And that’s Laodamas, for he’s mine host.[5]"
5989,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And who will fight, or wrangle, with his friend?"
5990,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Unwise he is, and base, that will contend"
5991,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With him that feeds him in a foreign place;
5992,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And takes all edge off from his own sought grace.
5993,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"None else except I here, nor none despise,"
5994,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But wish to know, and prove his faculties,"
5995,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That dares appear now. No strife ye can name
5996,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Am I unskill’d in; reckon any game
5997,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all that are, as many as there are"
5998,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In use with men. For archery I dare
5999,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Affirm myself not mean. Of all a troop
6000,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I’ll make the first foe with mine arrow stoop,"
6001,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Though with me ne’er so many fellows bend
6002,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their bows at mark’d men, and affect their end."
6003,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Only was Philoctetes with his bow
6004,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Still my superior, when we Greeks would show"
6005,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our archery against our foes of Troy.
6006,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But all, that now by bread frail life enjoy,"
6007,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I far hold my inferiors. Men of old,"
6008,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"None now alive shall witness me so bold,"
6009,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To vaunt equality with, such men as these,"
6010,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Œchalián Eurytus, Hercules,"
6011,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Who with their bows durst with the Gods contend;
6012,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore caught Eurytus soon his end,"
6013,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor died at home, in age, a rev’rend man."
6014,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But by the great incenséd Delphian
6015,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was shot to death, for daring competence"
6016,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With him in all an archer’s excellence.
6017,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A spear I’ll hurl as far as any man
6018,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Shall shoot a shaft. How at a race I can
6019,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bestir my feet, I only yield to fear,"
6020,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And doubt to meet with my superior here.
6021,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So many seas so too much have misus’d
6022,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My limbs for race, and therefore have diffus’d"
6023,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A dissolution through my lovéd knees.”
6024,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he still’d all talking properties."
6025,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Alcinous only answer’d: “O my guest,"
6026,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In good part take we what you have been prest
6027,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With speech to answer. You would make appear
6028,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your virtues therefore, that will still shine where"
6029,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your only look is. Yet must this man give
6030,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your worth ill language; when, he does not live"
6031,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In sort of mortals (whencesoe’er he springs,"
6032,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That judgment hath to speak becoming things)
6033,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That will deprave your virtues. Note then now
6034,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My speech, and what my love presents to you,"
6035,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That you may tell heroës, when you come"
6036,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To banquet with your wife and birth at home,"
6037,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Mindful of our worth) what deservings Jove
6038,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hath put on our parts likewise, in remove"
6039,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From sire to son, as an inherent grace"
6040,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Kind, and perpetual. We must needs give place"
6041,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To other countrymen, and freely yield"
6042,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We are not blameless in our fights of field,"
6043,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Buffets, nor wrastlings; but in speed of feet,"
6044,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all the equipage that fits a fleet,"
6045,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,We boast us best; for table ever spread
6046,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With neighbour feasts, for garments varied,"
6047,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For poesy, music, dancing, baths, and beds."
6048,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And now, Phæacians, you that bear your heads"
6049,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And feet with best grace in enamouring dance,"
6050,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Enflame our guest here, that he may advance"
6051,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our worth past all the world’s to his home-friends,"
6052,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As well for the unmatch’d grace that commends.
6053,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your skill in footing of a dance, as theirs"
6054,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That fly a race best. And so, all affairs,"
6055,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At which we boast us best, he best may try,"
6056,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As sea-race, land-race, dance, and poesy."
6057,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some one with instant speed to court retire,"
6058,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And fetch Demodocus’s soundful lyre.”
6059,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This said the God-grac’d king; and quick resort
6060,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Pontonous made for that fair harp to court.
6061,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nine of the lot-choos’d public rulers rose,"
6062,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That all in those contentions did dispose,"
6063,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Commanding a most smooth ground, and a wide,"
6064,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all the people in fair game aside.
6065,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then with the rich harp came Pontonous,"
6066,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And in the midst took place Demodocus.
6067,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About him then stood forth the choice young men,[6]"
6068,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That on man’s first youth made fresh entry then,"
6069,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had art to make their natural motion sweet,"
6070,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And shook a most divine dance from their feet,"
6071,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That twinkled star-like, mov’d as swift, and fine,"
6072,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And beat the air so thin, they made it shine."
6073,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses wonder’d at it, but amaz’d"
6074,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He stood in mind to hear the dance so phras’d.
6075,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For, as they danc’d, Demodocus did sing,"
6076,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The bright-crown’d Venus’ love with Battle’s King;
6077,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As first they closely mix’d in th’ house of fire.
6078,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What worlds of gifts won her to his desire,"
6079,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Who then the night-and-day-bed did defile
6080,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of good king Vulcan. But in little while
6081,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Sun their mixture saw, and came and told."
6082,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The bitter news did by his ears take hold
6083,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Vulcan’s heart. Then to his forge he went,"
6084,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And in his shrewd mind deep stuff did invent.
6085,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His mighty anvil in the stock he put,"
6086,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And forg’d a net that none could loose or cut,"
6087,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That when it had them it might hold them fast.
6088,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which having finish’d, he made utmost haste"
6089,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up to the dear room where his wife he woo’d,"
6090,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, madly wrath with Mars, he all bestrow’d"
6091,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The bed, and bed-posts, all the beam above"
6092,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That cross’d the chamber; and a circle strove
6093,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of his device to wrap in all the room.
6094,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ’twas as pure, as of a spider’s loom"
6095,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The woof before ’tis wov’n. No man nor God
6096,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Could set his eye on it, a sleight so odd"
6097,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His art show’d in it. All his craft bespent
6098,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About the bed, he feign’d as if he went"
6099,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To well-built Lemnos, his most lovéd town"
6100,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all towns earthly; nor left this unknown
6101,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To golden-bridle-using Mars, who kept"
6102,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No blind watch over him, but, seeing stept"
6103,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His rival so aside, he hasted home"
6104,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With fair-wreath’d Venus’ love stung, who was come"
6105,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,New from the court of her most mighty Sire.
6106,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mars enter’d, wrung her hand, and the retire"
6107,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her husband made to Lemnos told, and said;"
6108,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Now, love, is Vulcan gone, let us to bed,"
6109,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He’s for the barbarous Sintians.” Well appay’d
6110,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was Venus with it; and afresh assay’d
6111,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their old encounter. Down they went; and straight
6112,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About them cling’d the artificial sleight
6113,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of most wise Vulcan; and were so ensnar’d,"
6114,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That neither they could stir their course prepar’d
6115,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In any limb about them, nor arise."
6116,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then they knew, they would no more disguise"
6117,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their close conveyance, but lay, forc’d, stone-still."
6118,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Back rush’d the both-foot-cook’d, but straight in skill,"
6119,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From his near scout-hole turn’d, nor ever went"
6120,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To any Lemnos, but the sure event"
6121,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Left Phœbus to discover, who told all."
6122,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then home hopp’d Vulcan, full of grief and gall,"
6123,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stood in the portal, and cried out so high,"
6124,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That all the Gods heard; “Father of the sky,"
6125,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ev’ry other deathless God,” said he,"
6126,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Come all, and a ridiculous object see,"
6127,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yet not sufferable neither. Come,"
6128,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And witness how, when still I step from home,"
6129,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lame that I am, Jove’s daughter doth profess"
6130,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To do me all the shameful offices,"
6131,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Indignities, despites, that can be thought;"
6132,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And loves this all-things-making-come-to-nought,"
6133,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since he is fair forsooth, foot-sound, and I"
6134,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Took in my brain a little, legg’d awry."
6135,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And no fault mine, but all my parent’s fault,"
6136,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who should not get, if mock me, with my halt."
6137,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But see how fast they sleep, while I, in moan,"
6138,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Am only made an idle looker on.
6139,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One bed their turn serves, and it must be mine;"
6140,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I think yet, I have made their self-loves shine."
6141,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They shall no more wrong me, and none perceive;"
6142,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor will they sleep together, I believe,"
6143,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With too hot haste again. Thus both shall lie
6144,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In craft, and force, till the extremity"
6145,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all the dow’r I gave her sire (to gain
6146,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A doggéd set-fac’d girl, that will not stain"
6147,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her face with blushing, though she shame her head)"
6148,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He pays me back. She’s fair, but was no maid.”"
6149,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"While this long speech was making, all were come"
6150,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Vulcan’s wholly-brazen-founded home,"
6151,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Earth-shaking Neptune, useful Mercury,"
6152,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And far-shot Phœbus. No She-Deity,"
6153,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For shame, would show there. All the give-good Gods"
6154,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stood in the portal, and past periods"
6155,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Gave length to laughters, all rejoic’d to see"
6156,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That which they said, that no impiety"
6157,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Finds good success at th’ end. “And now,” said one,"
6158,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“The slow outgoes the swift. Lame Vulcan, known"
6159,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To be the slowest of the Gods, outgoes"
6160,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Mars the most swift. And this is that which grows
6161,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To greatest justice: that adult’ry’s sport,"
6162,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Obtain’d by craft, by craft of other sort"
6163,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(And lame craft too) is plagued, which grieves the more,"
6164,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That sound limbs turning lame the lame restore.”[7]
6165,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This speech amongst themselves they entertain’d,"
6166,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When Phœbus thus ask’d Hermes: “Thus enchain’d
6167,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wouldst thou be, Hermes, to be thus disclos’d?"
6168,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Though with thee golden Venus were repos’d?”
6169,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He soon gave that an answer: “O,” said he,"
6170,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Thou king of archers, would ’twere thus with me!"
6171,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though thrice so much shame; nay, though infinite"
6172,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were pour’d about me, and that ev’ry light,"
6173,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In great heav’n shining, witness’d all my harms,"
6174,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So golden Venus slumber’d in mine arms.”
6175,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Gods again laugh’d; even the Watery State
6176,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wrung out a laughter, but propitiate"
6177,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was still for Mars, and pray’d the God of Fire"
6178,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He would dissolve him, off’ring the desire"
6179,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He made to Jove to pay himself, and said,"
6180,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All due debts should be by the Gods repaid.
6181,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Pay me, no words,” said he, “where deeds lend pain,"
6182,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Wretched the words are giv’n for wretched men.
6183,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"How shall I bind you in th’ Immortals’ sight,"
6184,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If Mars be once loos’d, nor will pay his right?”[8]"
6185,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Vulcan,” said he, “if Mars should fly, nor see"
6186,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy right repaid, it should be paid by me.”"
6187,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Your word, so giv’n, I must accept,” said he."
6188,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which said, he loos’d them. Mars then rush’d from sky,"
6189,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And stoop’d cold Thrace. The laughing Deity
6190,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For Cyprus was, and took her Paphian state,"
6191,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where she a grove, ne’er cut, had consecrate,"
6192,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All with Arabian odours fum’d, and hath"
6193,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"An altar there, at which the Graces bathe,"
6194,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And with immortal balms besmooth, her skin,"
6195,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Fit for the bliss Immortals solace in;
6196,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Deck’d her in to-be-studiéd attire,"
6197,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And apt to set beholders’ hearts on fire.
6198,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This sung the sacred muse, whose notes and words"
6199,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The dancers’ feet kept as his hands his chords.
6200,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses much was pleas’d, and all the crew."
6201,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This would the king have varied with a new
6202,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And pleasing measure, and performéd by"
6203,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Two, with whom none would strive in dancery;"
6204,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And those his sons were, that must therefore dance"
6205,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Alone, and only to the harp advance,"
6206,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Without the words. And this sweet couple was
6207,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Young Halius, and divine Laodamas;"
6208,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who danc’d a ball-dance. Then the rich-wrought ball,"
6209,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That Polybus had made, of purple all,"
6210,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They took to hand. One threw it to the sky,"
6211,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then danc’d back; the other, capering high,"
6212,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would surely catch it ere his foot touch’d ground,"
6213,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And up again advanc’d it, and so found"
6214,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The other cause of dance; and then did he
6215,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dance lofty tricks, till next it came to be"
6216,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His turn to catch, and serve the other still."
6217,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When they had kept it up to either’s will,"
6218,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They then danc’d ground tricks, oft mix’d hand in hand,"
6219,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And did so gracefully their change command,"
6220,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That all the other youth that stood at pause,"
6221,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With deaf’ning shouts, gave them the great applause."
6222,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then said Ulysses: “O, past all men here"
6223,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Clear, not in pow’r, but in desert as clear,"
6224,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You said your dancers did the world surpass,"
6225,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And they perform it clear, and to amaze.”"
6226,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This won Alcinous’ heart, and equal prize"
6227,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He gave Ulysses, saying: “Matchless wise,"
6228,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Princes and rulers, I perceive our guest,"
6229,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And therefore let our hospitable best
6230,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In fitting gifts be giv’n him: Twelve chief kings
6231,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,There are that order all the glorious things
6232,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of this our kingdom; and, the thirteenth, I"
6233,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Exist, as crown to all. Let instantly"
6234,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Be thirteen garments giv’n him, and of gold"
6235,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Precious, and fine, a talent. While we hold"
6236,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This our assembly, be all fetch’d, and giv’n,"
6237,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That to our feast prepar’d, as to his heav’n,"
6238,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our guest may enter. And, that nothing be"
6239,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Left unperform’d that fits his dignity,"
6240,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Euryalus shall here conciliate
6241,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Himself with words and gifts, since past our rate"
6242,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He gave bad language.” This did all commend
6243,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And give in charge; and ev’ry king did send
6244,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His herald for his gift. Euryalus,"
6245,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Answ’ring for his part, said: “Alcinous!"
6246,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our chief of all, since you command, I will"
6247,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To this our guest by all means reconcile,"
6248,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And give him this entirely-metall’d sword,"
6249,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The handle massy silver, and the board,"
6250,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That gives it cover, all of ivory,"
6251,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"New, and in all kinds worth his quality.”"
6252,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This put he straight into his hand, and said:"
6253,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Frolic, O guest and father; if words fled"
6254,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Have been offensive, let swift whirlwinds take"
6255,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And ravish them from thought. May all Gods make
6256,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy wife’s sight good to thee, in quick retreat"
6257,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all thy friends, and best-lov’d breeding seat,"
6258,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their long miss quitting with the greater joy;
6259,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In whose sweet vanish all thy worst annoy.”
6260,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“And frolic thou to all height, friend,” said he,"
6261,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“Which heav’n confirm with wish’d felicity;
6262,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor ever give again desire to thee
6263,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of this sword’s use, which with affects so free,"
6264,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In my reclaim, thou hast bestow’d on me.”"
6265,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, athwart his shoulders he put on"
6266,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The right fair sword; and then did set the sun.
6267,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When all the gifts were brought, which back again"
6268,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(With king Alcinous in all the train)
6269,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Were by the honour’d heralds borne to court;
6270,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which his fair sons took, and from the resort"
6271,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Laid by their rev’rend mother. Each his throne
6272,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all the peers (which yet were overshone
6273,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In king Alcinous’ command) ascended;
6274,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom he to pass as much in gifts contended,"
6275,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And to his queen said: “Wife! See brought me here
6276,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fairest cabinet I have, and there"
6277,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Impose a well-cleans’d in, and utter, weed."
6278,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A caldron heat with water, that with speed"
6279,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our guest well-bath’d, and all his gifts made sure,"
6280,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It may a joyful appetite procure
6281,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his succeeding feast, and make him hear"
6282,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The poet’s hymn with the securer ear.
6283,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all which I will add my bowl of gold,"
6284,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all frame curious, to make him hold"
6285,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My memory always dear, and sacrifice"
6286,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With it at home to all the Deities.”
6287,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then Arete her maids charg’d to set on
6288,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A well-siz’d caldron quickly. Which was done,"
6289,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Clear water pour’d in, flame made so entire,"
6290,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It gilt the brass, and made the water fire."
6291,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In mean space, from her chamber brought the queen"
6292,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A wealthy cabinet, where, pure and clean,"
6293,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She put the garments, and the gold bestow’d"
6294,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By that free state, and then the other vow’d"
6295,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By her Alcinous, and said: “Now, guest,"
6296,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Make close and fast your gifts, lest, when you rest"
6297,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Aship-board sweetly, in your way you meet"
6298,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some loss, that less may make your next sleep sweet.”"
6299,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This when Ulysses heard, all sure he made"
6300,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Enclos’d and bound safe; for the saving trade
6301,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The rev’rend-for-her-wisdom, Circe, had"
6302,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In foreyears taught him. Then the handmaid bad
6303,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His worth to bathing; which rejoic’d his heart,"
6304,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For, since he did with his Calypso part,"
6305,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He had no hot baths; none had favour’d him,"
6306,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor been so tender of his kingly limb.
6307,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But all the time he spent in her abode,"
6308,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He liv’d respected as he were a God.
6309,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cleans’d then and balm’d, fair shirt and robe put on,"
6310,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fresh come from bath, and to the feasters gone,"
6311,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nausicaa, that from the Gods’ hands took"
6312,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sov’reign beauty of her blessed look,"
6313,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stood by a well-carv’d column of the room,"
6314,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And through her eye her heart was overcome
6315,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With admiration of the port imprest
6316,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his aspéct, and said: “God save you, guest!"
6317,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Be cheerful, as in all the future state"
6318,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your home will show you in your better fate.
6319,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But yet, ev’n then, let this remember’d be,"
6320,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your life’s price I lent, and you owe it me.”"
6321,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The varied-in-all-counsels gave reply:
6322,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“Nausicaa! Flow’r of all this empery!
6323,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So Juno’s husband, that the strife for noise"
6324,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Makes in the clouds, bless me with strife of joys,"
6325,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In the desir’d day that my house shall show,"
6326,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As I, as I to a Goddess there shall vow,"
6327,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To thy fair hand that did my being give,"
6328,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which I’ll acknowledge ev’ry hour I live.”
6329,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, Alcinous plac’d him by his side."
6330,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then took they feast, and did in parts divide"
6331,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sev’ral dishes, fill’d out wine, and then"
6332,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The striv’d-for-for-his-worth of worthy men,[9]"
6333,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And rev’renc’d-of-the-state, Demodocus"
6334,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was brought in by the good Pontonous.
6335,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In midst of all the guests they gave him place,"
6336,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against a lofty pillar, when this grace"
6337,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The grac’d-with-wisdom did him: From the chine,"
6338,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That stood before him, of a white-tooth’d swine,"
6339,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Being far the daintiest joint, mix’d through with fat,"
6340,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He carv’d to him, and sent it where he sat"
6341,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By his old friend the herald, willing thus:"

6377,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From whence the Trojans up to Ilion drew
6378,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The dreadful engine. Where sat all arew
6379,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their kings about it; many counsels giv’n
6380,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,How to dispose it. In three ways were driv’n
6381,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their whole distractions. First, if they should feel"
6382,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The hollow wood’s heart, search’d with piercing steel;"

6407,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This the divine expressor did so give
6408,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both act and passion, that he made it live,"
6409,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And to Ulysses’ facts did breathe a fire

6419,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In tears his feeling brain swet; for, in things[12]"
6420,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That move past utt’rance, tears ope all their springs."
6421,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor are there in the pow’rs that all life bears
6422,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,More true interpreters of all than tears.
6423,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as a lady mourns her sole-lov’d lord,"
6424,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That fall’n before his city by the sword,"

6434,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eats down her cheeks with tears, and feeds life’s flame"
6435,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With miserable suff’rance; so this king
6436,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of tear-swet anguish op’d a boundless spring;
6437,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor yet was seen to any one man there
6438,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But king Alcinous, who sat so near"
6439,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He could not ‘scape him, sighs, so chok’d, so brake"
6440,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From all his tempers; which the king did take
6441,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both note and grave respect of, and thus spake:"
6442,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Hear me, Phæacian councillors and peers,"
6443,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And cease Demodocus; perhaps all ears
6444,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Are not delighted with his song, for, ever"
6445,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since the divine Muse sung, our guest hath never"
6446,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Contain’d from secret mournings. It may fall,"
6447,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That something sung he hath been grieved with all,"
6448,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As touching his particular. Forbear,"
6449,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That feast may jointly comfort all hearts here,"
6450,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And we may cheer our guest up; ’tis our best
6451,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In all due honour. For our rev’rend guest
6452,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is all our celebration, gifts, and all,"
6453,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His love hath added to our festival.
6454,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A guest, and suppliant too, we should esteem"
6455,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dear as our brother, one that doth but dream"
6456,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He hath a soul, or touch but at a mind"
6457,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Deathless and manly, should stand so inclin’d."
6458,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor cloak you longer with your curious wit,"
6459,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lov’d guest, what ever we shall ask of it."
6460,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It now stands on your honest state to tell,"
6461,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore give your name, nor more conceal"
6462,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What of your parents, and the town that bears"
6463,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Name of your native, or of foreigners"

6467,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Impos’d as fit as to be borne. What earth,"
6468,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"People, and city, own you, give to know."
6469,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tell but our ships all, that your way must show."
6470,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For our ships know th’ expressed minds of men,"
6471,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And will so most intentively retain
6472,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their scopes appointed, that they never err,"
6473,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yet use never any man to steer,"
6474,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor any rudders have, as others need."
6475,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They know men’s thoughts, and whither tends their speed,"
6476,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And there will set them; for you cannot name[13]

6479,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And they will fly to them, though they ebb and flow"
6480,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In blackest clouds and nights; and never bear
6481,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of any wrack or rock the slend’rest fear.
6482,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But this I heard my sire Nausithous say.
6483,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Long since, that Neptune, seeing us convey"
6484,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So safely passengers of all degrees,"
6485,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was angry with us; and upon our seas

6487,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From safe deduction of some stranger home,"
6488,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Made in his flitting billows stick stone still;
6489,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And dimm’d our city, like a mighty hill"
6490,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With shade cast round about it. This report,"
6491,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The old king made;[14] in which miraculous sort,"
6492,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If God had done such things, or left undone,"
6493,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At his good pleasure be it. But now, on,"
6494,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And truth relate us, both whence you err’d,"
6495,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And to what clime of men would be transferr’d,"
6496,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all their fair towns, be they as they are,"
6497,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If rude, unjust, and all irregular,"
6498,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or hospitable, bearing minds that please"
6499,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The mighty Deity. Which one of these
6500,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You would be set at, say, and you are there."
6501,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore what afflicts you? Why, to hear"
6502,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fate of Greece and Ilion, mourn you so?"
6503,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Gods have done it; as to all they do
6504,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Destine destruction, that from thence may rise"
6505,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A poem to instruct posterities.
6506,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Fell any kinsman before Ilion?
6507,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some worthy sire-in-law, or like-near son,"
6508,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whom next our own blood and self-race we love?
6509,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or any friend perhaps, in whom did move"
6510,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A knowing soul, and no unpleasing thing?"
6511,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since such a good one is no underling

6683,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To alter us unhappy, which ev’n strove"
6684,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To give us suff’rance. At our fleet we made
6685,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Enforcéd stand; and there did they invade
6686,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our thrust-up forces; darts encounter’d darts,"
6687,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With blows on both sides; either making parts
6688,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Good upon either, while the morning shone,"
6689,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And sacred day her bright increase held on,"
6690,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Though much out-match’d in number; but as soon
6691,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As Phœbus westward fell, the Cicons won"
6692,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Much hand of us; six proved soldiers fell,"
6693,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of ev’ry ship, the rest they did compel!"
6694,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To seek of Flight escape from Death and Fate.
6695,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
6696,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thence sad in heart we sail’d; and yet our state
6697,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was something cheer’d, that (being o’er-match’d so much"
6698,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In violent number) our retreat was such
6699,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As sav’d so many. Our dear loss the less,"
6700,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That they surviv’d, so like for like success."
6701,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet left we not the coast, before we call’d"
6702,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Home to our country-earth the souls exhal’d
6703,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all the friends the Cicons overcame.
6704,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thrice call’d we on them by their sev’ral name,[5]"
6705,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And then took leave. Then from the angry North
6706,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Cloud-gath’ring Jove a dreadful storm call’d forth
6707,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against our navy, cover’d shore and all"
6708,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With gloomy vapours. Night did headlong fall
6709,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From frowning heav’n. And then hurl’d here and there
6710,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was all our navy; the rude winds did tear
6711,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In three, in four parts, all their sails; and down"
6712,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Driv’n under hatches were we, prest to drown."
6713,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up rush’d we yet again, and with tough hand"
6714,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Two days, two nights, entoil’d) we gat near land,"
6715,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Labours and sorrows eating up our minds.
6716,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The third clear day yet, to more friendly winds"
6717,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We masts advanc’d, we white sails spread, and sate."
6718,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Forewinds and guides again did iterate
6719,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our ease and home-hopes; which we clear had reach’d,"
6720,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had not, by chance, a sudden north-wind fetch’d,"
6721,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With an extreme sea, quite about again"
6722,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our whole endeavours, and our course constrain"
6723,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To giddy round, and with our bow’d sails greet"
6724,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dreadful Maleia, calling back our fleet"
6725,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As far forth as Cythera. Nine days more
6726,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Adverse winds toss’d me; and the tenth, the shore,"
6727,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where dwelt the blossom-fed Lotophagi,"
6728,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I fetch’d, fresh water took in, instantly"
6729,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fell to our food aship-board, and then sent"
6730,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Two of my choice men to the continent
6731,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Adding a third, a herald) to discover"
6732,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,What sort of people were the rulers over
6733,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The land next to us. Where, the first they met,"
6734,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were the Lotophagi, that made them eat"
6735,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their country-diet, and no ill intent"
6736,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Hid in their hearts to them; and yet th’ event
6737,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To ill converted it, for having eat"
6738,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their dainty viands, they did quite forget"
6739,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(As all men else that did but taste their feast)
6740,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both countrymen and country, nor addrest"
6741,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Any return t’ inform what sort of men
6742,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made fix’d abode there, but would needs maintain"
6743,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Abode themselves there, and eat that food ever."
6744,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I made out after, and was feign to sever"
6745,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Th’ enchanted knot by forcing their retreat;
6746,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That striv’d, and wept, and would not leave their meat"
6747,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For heav’n itself. But, dragging them to fleet,"
6748,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I wrapt in sure bands both their hands and feet,"
6749,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And cast them under hatches, and away"
6750,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Commanded all the rest without least stay,"
6751,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lest they should taste the lote too, and forget"
6752,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With such strange raptures their despis’d retreat.
6753,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All then aboard, we beat the sea with oars,"
6754,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And still with sad hearts sail’d by out-way shores,"
6755,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Till th’ out-law’d Cyclops’ land we fetch’d; a race
6756,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of proud-liv’d loiterers, that never sow,"
6757,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor put a plant in earth, nor use a plow,"
6758,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But trust in God for all things; and their earth,"
6759,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Unsown, unplow’d, gives ev’ry offspring birth"
6760,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That other lands have; wheat, and barley, vines"
6761,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That bear in goodly grapes delicious wines;
6762,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Jove sends show’rs for all. No councils there,"
6763,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor councillors, nor laws; but all men bear"
6764,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their heads aloft on mountains, and those steep,"
6765,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And on their tops too; and their houses keep
6766,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In vaulty caves, their households govern’d all"
6767,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By each man’s law, impos’d in several,"
6768,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor wife, nor child awed, but as he thinks good,"
6769,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,None for another caring. But there stood
6770,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Another little isle, well stor’d with wood,"
6771,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Betwixt this and the entry; neither nigh
6772,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Cyclops’ isle, nor yet far off doth lie,"
6773,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Men’s want it suffer’d, but the men’s supplies"
6774,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The goats made with their inarticulate cries.
6775,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Goats beyond number this small island breeds,"
6776,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So tame, that no access disturbs their feeds,"
6777,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No hunters, that the tops of mountains scale,"
6778,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And rub through woods with toil, seek them at all."
6779,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor is the soil with flocks fed down, not plow’d,"
6780,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor ever in it any seed was sow’d.
6781,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor place the neighbour Cyclops their delights
6782,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In brave vermilion-prow-deck’d ships; nor wrights
6783,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Useful, and skilful in such works as need"
6784,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Perfection to those traffics that exceed
6785,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their natural confines, to fly out and see"
6786,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cities of men, and take in mutually"
6787,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The prease of others; to themselves they live,"
6788,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And to their island that enough would give
6789,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A good inhabitant; and time of year
6790,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Observe to all things art could order there.
6791,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There, close upon the sea, sweet meadows spring;"
6792,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That yet of fresh streams want no watering
6793,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To their soft burthens, but of special yield."
6794,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your vines would be there; and your common field
6795,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But gentle work make for your plow, yet bear"
6796,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A lofty harvest when you came to shear;
6797,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For passing fat the soil is. In it lies
6798,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A harbour so oppórtune, that no ties,"
6799,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Halsers, or gables need, nor anchors cast."
6800,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom storms put in there are with stay embrac’d,[6]"
6801,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or to their full wills safe, or winds aspire"
6802,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To pilots’ uses their more quick desire.
6803,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At entry of the haven, a silver ford"
6804,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is from a rock-impressing fountain pour’d,"
6805,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All set with sable poplars. And this port
6806,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were we arriv’d at, by the sweet resort"
6807,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of some God guiding us, for ’twas a night"
6808,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So ghastly dark all port was past our sight,"
6809,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Clouds hid our ships, and would not let the moon"
6810,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Afford a beam to us, the whole isle won"
6811,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By not an eye of ours. None thought the blore,"
6812,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That then was up, shov’d waves’ against the shore,"
6813,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That then to an unmeasur’d height put on;
6814,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We still at sea esteem’d us, till alone"
6815,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our fleet put in itself. And then were strook
6816,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our gather’d sails; our rest ashore we took,"
6817,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And day expected. When the morn gave fire,"
6818,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We rose, and walk’d, and did the isle admire;"
6819,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Nymphs, Jove’s daughters, putting up a herd"
6820,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of mountain goats to us, to render cheer’d"
6821,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My fellow soldiers. To our fleet we flew,"
6822,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our crooked bows took, long-pil’d darts, and drew"
6823,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ourselves in three parts out; when, by the grace"
6824,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That God vouchsaf’d, we made a gainful chace."
6825,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Twelve ships we had, and ev’ry ship had nine"
6826,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fat goats allotted [it], ten only mine."
6827,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus all that day, ev’n till the sun was set,"
6828,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We sat and feasted, pleasant wine and meat"
6829,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Plenteously taking; for we had not spent
6830,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our ruddy wine aship-board, supplement"
6831,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of large sort each man to his vessel drew,"
6832,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When we the sacred city overthrew
6833,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That held the Cicons. Now then saw we near
6834,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Cyclops’ late-prais’d island, and might hear"
6835,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The murmur of their sheep and goats, and see"
6836,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their smokes ascend. The sun then set, and we,"
6837,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When night succeeded, took our rest ashore."
6838,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And when the world the morning’s favour wore,"
6839,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I call’d my friends to council, charging them"
6840,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To make stay there, while I took ship and stream,"
6841,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With some associates, and explor’d what men"
6842,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The neighbour isle held; if of rude disdain,"
6843,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Churlish and tyrannous, or minds bewray’d"
6844,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pious and hospitable. Thus much said,"
6845,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I boarded, and commanded to ascend"
6846,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My friends and soldiers, to put off, and lend"
6847,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Way to our ship. They boarded, sat, and beat"
6848,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The old sea forth, till we might see the seat"
6849,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The greatest Cyclop held for his abode,"
6850,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which was a deep cave, near the common road"
6851,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of ships that touch’d there, thick with laurels spread,"
6852,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Where many sheep and goats lay shadowéd;
6853,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, near to this, a hall of torn-up stone,"
6854,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"High built with pines, that heav’n and earth attone,"
6855,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And lofty-fronted oaks; in which kept house
6856,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A man in shape immane, and monsterous,"
6857,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fed all his flocks alone, nor would afford"
6858,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Commerce with men, but had a wit abhorr’d,"
6859,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His mind his body answ’ring. Nor was he
6860,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Like any man that food could possibly
6861,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Enhance so hugely, but, beheld alone,"
6862,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Show’d like a steep hill’s top, all overgrown"
6863,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With trees and brambles; little thought had I
6864,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of such vast objects. When, arriv’d so nigh,"
6865,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some of my lov’d friends I made stay aboard,"
6866,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To guard my ship; and twelve with me I shor’d,"
6867,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The choice of all. I took besides along
6868,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A goat-skin flagon of wine, black and strong,"
6869,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That Maro did present, Evantheus’ son,"
6870,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And priest to Phœbus, who had mansión"
6871,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In Thracian Ismarus (the town I took).
6872,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He gave it me, since I (with rev’rence strook"
6873,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his grave place, his wife and children’s good)"
6874,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Freed all of violence. Amidst a wood,"
6875,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sacred to Phœbus, stood his house; from whence"
6876,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He fetch’d me gifts of varied excellence;
6877,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Sev’n talents of fine gold; a bowl all fram’d
6878,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of massy silver; but his gift most fam’d
6879,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was twelve great vessels, fill’d with such rich wine"
6880,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As was incorruptible and divine.
6881,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He kept it as his jewel, which none knew"
6882,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But he himself, his wife, and he that drew."
6883,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It was so strong that never any fill’d
6884,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A cup, where that was but by drops instill’d,"
6885,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And drunk it off, but ’twas before allay’d"
6886,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With twenty parts in water; yet so sway’d
6887,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The spirit of that little, that the whole"
6888,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A sacred odour breath’d about the bowl.
6889,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had you the odour smelt and scent it cast,"
6890,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It would have vex’d you to forbear the taste.
6891,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But then, the taste gain’d too, the spirit it wrought"
6892,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To dare things high set-up-an-end my thought.
6893,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of this a huge great flagon full I bore,"
6894,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, in a good large knapsack, victuals store;"
6895,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And long’d to see this heap of fortitude,"
6896,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That so illit’rate was and upland rude
6897,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That laws divine nor human he had learn’d.
6898,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With speed we reach’d the cavern; nor discern’d
6899,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His presence there, his flocks he fed at field."
6900,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ent’ring his den, each thing beheld did yield"
6901,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our admiration; shelves with cheeses heap’d;
6902,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sheds stuff’d with lambs and goats, distinctly kept,"
6903,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Distinct the biggest, the more mean distinct,"
6904,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Distinct the youngest. And in their precinct,"
6905,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Proper and placeful, stood the troughs and pails,"
6906,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In which he milk’d; and what was giv’n at meals,"
6907,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Set up a creaming; in the ev’ning still
6908,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All scouring bright as dew upon the hill.
6909,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
6910,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then were my fellows instant to convey
6911,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Kids, cheeses, lambs, aship-board, and away"
6912,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sail the salt billow. I thought best not so,"
6913,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But better otherwise; and first would know,"
6914,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,What guest-gifts he would spare me. Little knew
6915,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My friends on whom they would have prey’d. His view
6916,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Prov’d after, that his inwards were too rough"
6917,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For such bold usage. We were bold enough
6918,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In what I suffer’d; which was there to stay,"
6919,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Make fire and feed there, though bear none away."
6920,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There sat we, till we saw him feeding come,"
6921,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And on his neck a burthen lugging home,"
6922,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Most highly huge, of sere-wood, which the pile"
6923,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That fed his fire supplied all supper-while.
6924,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Down by his den he threw it, and up rose"
6925,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A tumult with the fall. Afraid, we close"
6926,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Withdrew ourselves, while he into a cave"
6927,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of huge receipt his high-fed cattle drave,"
6928,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All that he milk’d; the males he left without
6929,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His lofty roofs, that all bestrow’d about"
6930,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With rams and buck-goats were. And then a rock
6931,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He lift aloft, that damm’d up to his flock"
6932,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The door they enter’d; ’twas so hard to wield,"
6933,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That two-and-twenty waggons, all four-wheel’d,"
6934,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Could they be loaded, and have teams that were"
6935,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Proportion’d to them) could not stir it there.
6936,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus making sure, he kneel’d and milk’d his ewes,"
6937,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And braying goats, with all a milker’s dues;"
6938,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then let in all their young. Then quick did dress
6939,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His half milk up for cheese, and in a press"
6940,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of wicker press’d it; put in bowls the rest,"
6941,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To drink and eat, and serve his supping feast."
6942,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All works dispatch’d thus, he began his fire;"
6943,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which blown, he saw us, and did thus inquire:"
6944,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,῾Ho! guests! What are ye? Whence sail ye these seas?
6945,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Traffic, or rove ye, and like thieves oppress"
6946,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Poor strange adventurers, exposing so"
6947,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your souls to danger, and your lives to woe?’"
6948,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This utter’d he, when fear from our hearts took"
6949,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The very life, to be so thunder-strook"
6950,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With such a voice, and such a monster see;"
6951,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But thus I answer’d: ‘Erring Grecians, we"
6952,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From Troy were turning homewards, but by force"
6953,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of adverse winds, in far diverted course,"
6954,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Such unknown ways took, and on rude seas toss’d,"
6955,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As Jove decreed, are cast upon this coast,"
6956,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Agamemnon, famous Atreus’ son,"
6957,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,We boast ourselves the soldiers; who hath won[7]
6958,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Renown that reacheth heav’n, to overthrow"
6959,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So great a city, and to ruin so"
6960,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So many nations. Yet at thy knees lie
6961,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our prostrate bosoms, forc’d with pray’rs to try"
6962,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If any hospitable right, or boon"
6963,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of other nature, such as have been won"
6964,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By laws of other houses, thou wilt give."
6965,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rev’rence the Gods, thou great’st of all that live."
6966,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,We suppliants are; and hospitable Jove
6967,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pours wreak on all whom pray’rs want pow’r to move,"
6968,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And with their plagues together will provide
6969,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That humble guests shall have their wants supplied.’
6970,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He cruelly answer’d: ‘O thou fool,’ said he,"
6971,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To come so far, and to importune me"
6972,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With any God’s fear, or observéd love!"
6973,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We Cyclops care not for your goat-fed Jove,"
6974,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor other Bless’d ones; we are better far.
6975,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Jove himself dare I bid open war,"
6976,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To thee, and all thy fellows, if I please."
6977,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But tell me, where’s the ship, that by the seas"
6978,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hath brought thee hither? If far off, or near,"
6979,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Inform me quickly.’ These his temptings were;
6980,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But I too much knew not to know his mind,"
6981,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And craft with craft paid, telling him the wind"
6982,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Thrust up from sea by Him that shakes the shore)
6983,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had dash’d our ships against his rocks, and tore"
6984,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her ribs in pieces close upon his coast,"
6985,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And we from high wrack sav’d, the rest were lost."
6986,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He answer’d nothing, but rush’d in, and took"
6987,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Two of my fellows up from earth, and strook"
6988,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their brains against it. Like two whelps they flew
6989,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About his shoulders, and did all embrue"
6990,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The blushing earth. No mountain lion tore
6991,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Two lambs so sternly, lapp’d up all their gore"
6992,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Gush’d from their torn-up bodies, limb by limb"
6993,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Trembling with life yet) ravish’d into him.
6994,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both flesh and marrow-stufféd bones he eat,"
6995,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And ev’n th’ uncleanséd entrails made his meat.
6996,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We, weeping, cast our hands to heav’n, to view"
6997,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A sight so horrid. Desperation flew,"
6998,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all our after lives, to instant death,"
6999,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In our believ’d destruction. But when breath
7000,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fury of his appetite had got,"
7001,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Because the gulf his belly reach’d his throat,"
7002,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Man’s flesh, and goat’s milk, laying lay’r on lay’r,"
7003,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Till near chok’d up was all the pass for air,"
7004,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Along his den, among’st his cattle, down"
7005,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He rush’d, and streak’d him. When my mind was grown"
7006,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Desp’rate to step in, draw my sword, and part"
7007,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His bosom where the strings about the heart
7008,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Circle the liver, and add strength of hand."
7009,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But that rash thought, more stay’d, did countermand,"
7010,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For there we all had perish’d, since it past"
7011,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our pow’rs to lift aside a log so vast,"
7012,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As barr’d all outscape; and so sigh’d away
7013,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The thought all night, expecting active day."
7014,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which come, he first of all his fire enflames,"
7015,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then milks his goats and ewes, then to their dams"
7016,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lets in their young, and, wondrous orderly,"
7017,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With manly haste dispatch’d his housewif’ry.
7018,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then to his breakfast, to which other two"
7019,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of my poor friends went; which eat, out then go"
7020,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His herds and fat flocks, lightly putting by"
7021,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The churlish bar, and clos’d it instantly;"
7022,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For both those works with ease as much he did,"
7023,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As you would ope and shut your quiver lid.
7024,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With storms of whistlings then his flock he drave
7025,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Up to the mountains; and occasion gave
7026,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For me to use my wits, which to their height"
7027,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I striv’d to screw up, that a vengeance might"
7028,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By some means fall from thence, and Pallas now"
7029,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Afford a full ear to my neediest vow.
7030,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This then my thoughts preferr’d: A huge club lay
7031,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Close by his milk-house, which was now in way"
7032,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To dry and season, being an olive-tree"
7033,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which late he fell’d, and, being green, must be"
7034,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made lighter for his manage. ’Twas so vast,"
7035,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That we resembled it to some fit mast,"
7036,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To serve a ship of burthen that was driv’n
7037,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With twenty oars, and had a bigness giv’n"
7038,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To bear a huge sea. Full so thick, so tall,"
7039,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We judg’d this club; which I, in part, hew’d small,"
7040,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And cut a fathom off. The piece I gave
7041,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst my soldiers, to take down, and shave;"
7042,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which done, I sharpen’d it at top, and then,"
7043,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Harden’d in fire, I hid it in the den"
7044,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Within a nasty dunghill reeking there,"
7045,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thick, and so moist it issued ev’rywhere."
7046,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then made I lots cast by my friends to try
7047,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whose fortune serv’d to dare the bor’d-out eye
7048,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of that man-eater; and the lot did fall
7049,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On four I wish’d to make my aid of all,"
7050,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And I the fifth made, chosen like the rest."
7051,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then came the even, and he came from the feast"
7052,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his fat cattle, drave in all; nor kept"
7053,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One male abroad; if, or his memory slept"
7054,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By Gods’ direct will, or of purpose was"
7055,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His driving in of all then, doth surpass"
7056,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My comprehension. But he clos’d again
7057,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The mighty bar, milk’d, and did still maintain"
7058,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All other observation as before.
7059,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His work all done, two of my soldiers more"
7060,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At once he snatch’d up, and to supper went."
7061,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then dar’d I words to him, and did present"
7062,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A bowl of wine, with these words: ‘Cyclop! take"
7063,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A bowl of wine, from my hand, that may make"
7064,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Way for the man’s flesh thou hast eat, and show"
7065,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,What drink our ship held; which in sacred vow
7066,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I offer to thee to take ruth on me
7067,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In my dismission home. Thy rages be
7068,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now no more sufferable. How shall men,"
7069,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mad and inhuman that thou art, again"
7070,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Greet thy abode, and get thy actions grace,"
7071,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If thus thou ragest, and eat’st up their race.’"
7072,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He took, and drunk, and vehemently joy’d"
7073,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To taste the sweet cup; and again employ’d
7074,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My flagon’s pow’rs, entreating more, and said:"
7075,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"῾Good guest, again afford my taste thy aid,"
7076,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And let me know thy name, and quickly now,"
7077,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That in thy recompense I may bestow
7078,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A hospitable gift on thy desert,"
7079,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And such a one as shall rejoice thy heart.
7080,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For to the Cyclops too the gentle earth
7081,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bears gen’rous wine, and Jove augments her birth,"
7082,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In store of such, with show’rs; but this rich wine"
7083,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fell from the river, that is mere divine,"
7084,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of nectar and ambrosia.’ This again
7085,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I gave him, and again; nor could the fool abstain,"
7086,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But drunk as often. When the noble juice
7087,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had wrought upon his spirit, I then gave use"
7088,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To fairer language, saying: ‘Cyclop! now,"
7089,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As thou demand’st, I’ll tell my name, do thou"
7090,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Make good thy hospitable gift to me.
7091,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My name is No-Man; No-Man each degree
7092,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of friends, as well as parents, call my name.’"
7093,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He answer’d, as his cruel soul became:"
7094,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,‘No-Man! I’ll eat thee last of all thy friends;
7095,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And this is that in which so much amends
7096,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I vow’d to thy deservings, thus shall be"
7097,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My hospitable gift made good to thee.’
7098,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he upwards fell, but then bent round"
7099,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His fleshy neck; and Sleep, with all crowns crown’d,"
7100,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Subdued the savage. From his throat brake out
7101,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My wine, with man’s-flesh gobbets, like a spout,"
7102,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When, loaded with his cups, he lay and snor’d;"
7103,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then took I the club’s end up, and gor’d"
7104,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The burning coal-heap, that the point might heat;"
7105,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Confirm’d my fellow’s minds, lest Fear should let"
7106,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their vow’d assay, and make them fly my aid."
7107,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Straight was the olive-lever, I had laid"
7108,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amidst the huge fire to get hard’ning, hot,"
7109,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And glow’d extremely, though ’twas green; which got"
7110,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From forth the cinders, close about me stood"
7111,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My hardy friends; but that which did the good
7112,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was God’s good inspiratión, that gave"
7113,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A spirit beyond the spirit they us’d to have;
7114,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who took the olive spar, made keen before,"
7115,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And plung’d it in his eye, and up I bore,"
7116,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bent to the top close, and help’d pour it in,"
7117,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With all my forces. And as you have seen
7118,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A ship-wright bore a naval beam, he oft"
7119,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thrusts at the auger’s froofe, works still aloft,"
7120,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And at the shank help others, with a cord"
7121,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wound round about to make it sooner bor’d,"
7122,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All plying the round still; so into his eye
7123,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The fiery stake we labour’d to imply.
7124,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Out gush’d the blood that scalded, his eye-ball"
7125,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thrust out a flaming vapour, that scorch’d all"
7126,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His brows and eye-lids, his eye-strings did crack,"
7127,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As in the sharp and burning rafter brake.
7128,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as a smith, to harden any tool,"
7129,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Broad axe, or mattock, in his trough doth cool"
7130,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The red-hot substance, that so fervent is"
7131,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It makes the cold wave straight to seethe and hiss;
7132,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So sod and hiss’d his eye about the stake.
7133,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He roar’d withal, and all his cavern brake"
7134,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In claps like thunder. We did frighted fly,"
7135,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Dispers’d in corners. He from forth his eye
7136,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The fixed stake pluck’d; after which the blood
7137,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Flow’d freshly forth; and, mad, he hurl’d the wood"
7138,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About his hovel. Out he then did cry
7139,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For other Cyclops, that in caverns by"
7140,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Upon a windy promontory dwell’d;
7141,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who, hearing how impetuously he yell’d,"
7142,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rush’d ev’ry way about him, and inquir’d,"
7143,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What ill afflicted him, that he exspir’d"
7144,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Such horrid clamours, and in sacred Night"
7145,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To break their sleeps so? Ask’d him, if his fright"
7146,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Came from some mortal that his flocks had driv’n?
7147,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or if by craft, or might, his death were giv’n?"
7148,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He answer’d from his den: ‘By craft, nor might,"
7149,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No-Man hath giv’n me death.’ They then said right,"
7150,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘If no man hurt thee, and thyself alone,"
7151,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That which is done to thee by Jove is done;
7152,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And what great Jove inflicts no man can fly.
7153,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pray to thy Father yet, a Deity,"
7154,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And prove, from him if thou canst help acquire.’"
7155,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus spake they, leaving him; when all-on-fire"
7156,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My heart with joy was, that so well my wit"
7157,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And name deceiv’d him; whom now pain did split,"
7158,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And groaning up and down he groping tried
7159,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To find the stone, which found, he put aside;"
7160,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But in the door sat, feeling if he could"
7161,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(As his sheep issued) on some man lay hold;
7162,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Esteeming me a fool, that could devise"
7163,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,No stratagem to ‘scape his gross surprise.
7164,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But I, contending what I could invent"
7165,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My friends and me from death so eminent
7166,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To get deliver’d, all my wiles I wove"
7167,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Life being the subject) and did this approve:
7168,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fat fleecy rams, most fair, and great, lay there,"
7169,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That did a burden like a violet bear.[8]
7170,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These, while this learn’d-in-villainy did sleep,"
7171,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I yok’d with osiers cut there, sheep to sheep,"
7172,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Three in a rank, and still the mid sheep bore"
7173,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A man about his belly, the two more"
7174,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"March’d on his each side for defence. I then,"
7175,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Choosing myself the fairest of the den,"
7176,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His fleecy belly under-crept, embrac’d"
7177,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His back, and in his rich wool wrapt me fast"
7178,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With both my hands, arm’d with as fast a mind."
7179,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thus each man hung, till the morning shin’d;"
7180,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which come, he knew the hour, and let abroad"
7181,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His male-flocks first, the females unmilk’d stood"
7182,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bleating and braying, their full bags so sore"
7183,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With being unemptied, but their shepherd more"
7184,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With being unsighted; which was cause his mind
7185,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Went not a milking. He, to wreak inclin’d,"
7186,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The backs felt, as they pass’d, of those male dams,"
7187,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Gross fool! believing, we would ride his rams!"
7188,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor ever knew that any of them bore
7189,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Upon his belly any man before.
7190,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The last ram came to pass him, with his wool"
7191,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And me together loaded to the full,"
7192,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For there did I hang; and that ram he stay’d,"
7193,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And me withal had in his hands, my head"
7194,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Troubled the while, not causelessly, nor least."
7195,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This ram he grop’d, and talk’d to: ‘Lazy beast!"
7196,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Why last art thou now? Thou hast never us’d
7197,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To lag thus hindmost, but still first hast bruis’d"
7198,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The tender blossom of a flow’r, and held"
7199,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"State in thy steps, both to the flood and field,"
7200,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"First still at fold at even, now last remain?"
7201,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dost thou not wish I had mine eye again,"
7202,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which that abhorr’d man No-Man did put out,"
7203,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Assisted by his execrable rout,"
7204,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When he had wrought me down with wine? But he
7205,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Must not escape my wreak so cunningly.
7206,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I would to heav’n thou knew’st, and could but speak,"
7207,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To tell me where he lurks now! I would break
7208,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His brain about my cave, strew’d here and there,"
7209,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To ease my heart of those foul ills, that were"
7210,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Th’ inflictions of a man I priz’d at nought.’
7211,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus let he him abroad; when I, once brought"
7212,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A little from his hold, myself first los’d,"
7213,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And next my friends. Then drave we, and dispos’d,"
7214,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His straight-legg’d fat fleece-bearers over land,"
7215,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ev’n till they all were in my ship’s command;
7216,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And to our lov’d friends show’d our pray’d-for sight,"
7217,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Escap’d from death. But, for our loss, outright"
7218,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They brake in tears; which with a look I stay’d,"
7219,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And bade them take our boot in. They obey’d,"
7220,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And up we all went, sat, and us’d our oars."
7221,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But having left as far the savage shores
7222,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As one might hear a voice, we then might see"
7223,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Cyclop at the haven; when instantly
7224,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I stay’d our oars, and this insultance us’d:"
7225,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,῾Cyclop! thou shouldst not have so much abus’d
7226,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy monstrous forces, to oppose their least"
7227,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against a man immartial, and a guest,"
7228,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And eat his fellows. Thou mightst know there were
7229,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some ills behind, rude swain, for thee to bear,"
7230,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That fear’d not to devour thy guests, and break"
7231,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All laws of humans. Jove sends therefore wreak,"
7232,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all the Gods, by me.’ This blew the more"
7233,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His burning fury; when the top he tore
7234,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From off a huge rock, and so right a throw"
7235,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made at our ship, that just before the prow"
7236,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It overflew and fell, miss’d mast and all"
7237,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Exceeding little; but about the fall
7238,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So fierce a wave it rais’d, that back it bore"
7239,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our ship so far, it almost touch’d the shore."
7240,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A bead-hook then, a far-extended one,"
7241,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I snatch’d up, thrust hard, and so set us gone"
7242,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Some little way; and straight commanded all
7243,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To help me with their oars, on pain to fall"
7244,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Again on our confusion. But a sign
7245,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I with my head made, and their oars were mine"
7246,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all performance. When we off were set,"
7247,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Then first, twice further) my heart was so great,"
7248,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It would again provoke him, but my men"
7249,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On all sides rush’d about me, to contain,"
7250,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And said: ‘Unhappy! why will you provoke
7251,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A man so rude, that with so dead a stroke,"
7252,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Giv’n with his rock-dart, made the sea thrust back"
7253,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our ship so far, and near hand forc’d our wrack?"
7254,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Should he again but hear your voice resound,"
7255,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And any word reach, thereby would be found"
7256,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His dart’s direction, which would, in his fall,"
7257,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Crush piece-meal us, quite split our ship and all;"
7258,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So much dart wields the monster.’ Thus urg’d they
7259,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Impossible things, in fear; but I gave way"
7260,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To that wrath which so long I held deprest,"
7261,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By great necessity conquer’d, in my breast:"
7262,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘Cyclop! if any ask thee, who impos’d[9]"
7263,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Th’ unsightly blemish that thine eye enclos’d,"
7264,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Say that Ulysses, old Laertes’ son,"
7265,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose seat is Ithaca, and who hath won"
7266,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Surname of City-razer, bor’d it out.’"
7267,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At this, he bray’d so loud, that round about"
7268,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He drave affrighted echoes through the air,"
7269,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said: ‘O beast! I was premonish’d fair,"
7270,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By aged prophecy, in one that was"
7271,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A great and good man, this should come to pass;"
7272,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And how ’tis prov’d now! Augur Telemus,"
7273,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Surnam’d Eurymides (that spent with us
7274,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His age in augury, and did exceed"
7275,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In all presage of truth) said all this deed
7276,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Should this event take, author’d by the hand"
7277,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of one Ulysses, who I thought was mann’d"
7278,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With great and goodly personage, and bore"
7279,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A virtue answerable; and this shore
7280,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Should shake with weight of such a conqueror;
7281,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When now a weakling came, a dwarfy thing,"
7282,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A thing of nothing; who yet wit did bring,"
7283,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That brought supply to all, and with his wine"
7284,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Put out the flame where all my light did shine.
7285,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Come, land again, Ulysses! that my hand"
7286,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"May guest-rites give thee, and the great command,"
7287,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That Neptune hath at sea, I may convert"
7288,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To the deduction where abides thy heart,"
7289,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With my solicitings, whose son I am,"
7290,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And whose fame boasts to bear my father’s name.
7291,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor think my hurt offends me, for my sire"
7292,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Can soon repose in it the visual fire,"
7293,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,At his free pleasure; which no pow’r beside
7294,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Can boast, of men, or of the Deified.’"
7295,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I answer’d: ‘Would to God! I could compell
7296,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both life and soul from thee, and send to hell"
7297,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Those spoils of nature! Hardly Neptune then
7298,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Could cure thy hurt, and give thee all again.’"
7299,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then flew fierce vows to Neptune, both his hands"
7300,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To star-born heav’n cast: ‘O thou that all lands
7301,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Gird’st in thy ambient circle, and in air"
7302,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shak’st the curl’d tresses of thy sapphire hair,"
7303,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If I be thine, or thou mayst justly vaunt"
7304,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou art my father, hear me now, and grant"
7305,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That this Ulysses, old Laertes’ son,"
7306,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That dwells in Ithaca, and name hath won"
7307,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of City-ruiner, may never reach"
7308,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His natural region. Or if to fetch
7309,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, and the sight of his fair roofs and friends,"
7310,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Be fatal to him, let him that amends"
7311,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For all his miseries, long time and ill,"
7312,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Smart for, and fail of; nor that fate fulfill,"
7313,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Till all his soldiers quite are cast away
7314,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In others’ ships. And when, at last, the day"
7315,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his sole-landing shall his dwelling show,"
7316,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Let Detriment prepare him wrongs enow.’
7317,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus pray’d he Neptune; who, his sire, appear’d,"
7318,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all his pray’r to ev’ry syllable heard.
7319,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But then a rock, in size more amplified"
7320,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Than first, he ravish’d to him, and implied"
7321,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A dismal strength in it, when, wheel’d about,"
7322,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He sent it after us; nor flew it out
7323,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From any blind aim, for a little pass"
7324,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beyond our fore-deck from the fall there was,"
7325,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With which the sea our ship gave back upon,"
7326,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And shrunk up into billows from the stone,"
7327,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our ship again repelling near as near
7328,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The shore as first. But then our rowers were,"
7329,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Being warn’d, more arm’d, and stronglier stemm’d the flood"
7330,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That bore back on us, till our ship made good"
7331,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The other island, where our whole fleet lay,"
7332,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In which our friends lay mourning for our stay,"
7333,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And ev’ry minute look’d when we should land.
7334,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where, now arriv’d, we drew up to the sand,"
7335,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Cyclops’ sheep dividing, that none there"
7336,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all our privates might be wrung, and bear"
7337,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Too much on pow’r. The ram yet was alone
7338,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By all my friends made all my portion
7339,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Above all others; and I made him then
7340,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A sacrifice for me and all my men[10]
7341,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To cloud-compelling Jove that all commands,"
7342,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To whom I burn’d the thighs; but my sad hands
7343,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Receiv’d no grace from him, who studied how"
7344,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To offer men and fleet to overthrow.
7345,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
7346,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All day, till sun-set, yet, we sat and eat,"
7347,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And lib’ral store took in of wine and meat.
7348,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sun then down, and place resign’d to shade,"
7349,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We slept. Morn came, my men I rais’d, and made"
7350,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All go aboard, weigh anchor, and away."
7351,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They boarded, sat, and beat the aged sea;"
7352,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And forth we made sail, sad for loss before,"
7353,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Any yet had comfort since we lost no more.”

7494,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When instant tempest did our vessel take,"
7495,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That bore us back to sea, to mourn anew"
7496,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our absent country. Up amaz’d I flew,"
7497,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And desp’rate things discours’d; if I should cast
7498,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Myself to ruin in the seas, or taste"
7499,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the living more moan, and sustain?"
7500,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Silent, I did so, and lay hid again"
7501,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beneath the hatches, while an ill wind took"
7502,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My ships back to Æolia, my men strook"
7503,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With woe enough. We pump’d and landed then,"
7504,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Took food, for all this; and of all my men"
7505,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I took a herald to me, and away"
7506,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Went to the court of Æolus, where they"
7507,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were feasting still; he, wife, and children, set"
7508,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Together close. We would not at their meat
7509,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thrust in; but humbly on the threshold sat.
7510,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He then, amaz’d, my presence wonder’d at,"
7511,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And call’d to me: ‘Ulysses! How thus back
7512,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Art thou arriv’d here? What foul spirit brake
7513,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Into thy bosom, to retire thee thus?"
7514,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,We thought we had deduction curious
7515,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Giv’n thee before, to reach thy shore and home;"
7516,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Did it not like thee?’ I, ev’n overcome"
7517,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With worthy sorrow, answer’d: ‘My ill men"
7518,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Have done me mischief, and to them hath been"
7519,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My sleep th’ unhappy motive; but do you,"
7520,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dearest of friends, deign succour to my vow."
7521,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your pow’rs command it.’ Thus endeavour’d I
7522,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With soft speech to repair my misery.
7523,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The rest with ruth sat dumb. But thus spake he:
7524,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘Avaunt, and quickly quit my land of thee,"
7525,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thou worst of all that breathe. It fits not me
7526,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To convoy, and take-in, whom Heav’ns expose."
7527,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Away, and with thee go the worst of woes,"
7528,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That seek’st my friendship, and the Gods thy foes.’"
7529,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus he dismiss’d me sighing. Forth we sail’d,"
7530,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,At heart afflicted. And now wholly fail’d
7531,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The minds my men sustain’d, so spent they were"
7532,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With toiling at their oars, and worse did bear"
7533,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their growing labours; and they caus’d their grought
7534,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By self-will’d follies; nor now ever thought
7535,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To see their country more. Six nights and days
7536,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,We sail’d; the seventh we saw fair Lamos raise
7537,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her lofty tow’rs, the Læstrygonian state"
7538,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That bears her ports so far disterminate;
7539,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where shepherd shepherd calls out, he at home[2]"
7540,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Is call’d out by the other that doth come
7541,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From charge abroad, and then goes he to sleep,"
7542,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The other issuing; he whose turn doth keep
7543,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The night observance hath his double hire,"
7544,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since day and night in equal length expire
7545,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About that region, and the night’s watch weigh’d"
7546,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At twice the day’s ward, since the charge that’s laid"
7547,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Upon the night’s-man (besides breach of sleep)
7548,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Exceeds the days-man’s; for one oxen keep,"
7549,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The other sheep. But when the haven we found,"
7550,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Exceeding famous, and environ’d round"
7551,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With one continuate rock, which so much bent"
7552,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That both ends almost met, so prominent"
7553,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They were, and made the haven’s mouth passing strait)"
7554,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our whole fleet in we got; in whose receit
7555,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our ships lay anchor’d close. Nor needed we
7556,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fear harm on any stays, Tranquillity[3]"
7557,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So purely sat there, that waves great nor small"
7558,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Did ever rise to any height at all.
7559,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yet would I no entry make, but stay’d"
7560,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Alone without the haven, and thence survey’d,"
7561,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From out a lofty watch-tow’r raised there,"
7562,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The country round about; nor anywhere
7563,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The work of man or beast appear’d to me,"
7564,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Only a smoke from earth break I might see.
7565,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I then made choice of two, and added more,"
7566,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A herald for associate, to explore"
7567,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What sort of men liv’d there. They went, and saw"
7568,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A beaten way, through which carts us’d to draw"
7569,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wood from the high hills to the town, and met"
7570,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A maid without the port, about to get"
7571,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Some near spring-water. She the daughter was
7572,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of mighty Læstrygonian Antiphas,"
7573,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And to the clear spring call’d Artacia went,"
7574,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To which the whole town for their water sent.
7575,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To her they came, and ask’d who govern’d there,"
7576,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And what the people whom he order’d were?
7577,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She answer’d not, but led them through the port,"
7578,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As making haste to show her father’s court.
7579,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where enter’d, they beheld, to their affright,"
7580,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A woman like a mountain-top in height,"
7581,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who rush’d abroad, and from the council-place"
7582,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Call’d home her horrid husband Antiphas,[4]"
7583,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who, deadly-minded, straight he snatch’d up one,"
7584,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And fell to supper. Both the rest were gone;
7585,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And to the fleet came. Antiphas a cry
7586,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Drave through the city; which heard, instantly"
7587,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This way and that innumerable sorts,"
7588,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not men, but giants, issued through the ports,"
7589,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And mighty flints from rocks tore, which they threw"
7590,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amongst our ships; through which an ill noise flew
7591,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of shiver’d ships, and life-expiring men,"
7592,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That were, like fishes, by the monsters slain,"
7593,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And borne to sad feast. While they slaughter’d these,"
7594,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That were engag’d in all th’ advantages
7595,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The close-mouth’d and most dead-calm haven could give,"
7596,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I, that without lay, made some means to live,"
7597,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My sword drew, cut my gables, and to oars"
7598,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Set all my men; and, from the plagues those shores"
7599,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let fly amongst us, we made haste to fly,"
7600,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My men close working as men loth to die.
7601,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My ship flew freely off; but theirs that lay
7602,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,On heaps in harbours could enforce no way
7603,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Through these stern fates that had engag’d them there.
7604,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Forth our sad remnant sail’d, yet still retain’d"
7605,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The joys of men, that our poor few remain’d."
7606,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then to the isle Ææa we attain’d,"
7607,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where fair-hair’d, dreadful, eloquent Circe reign’d,"
7608,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ææta’s sister both by dame and sire,"
7609,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both daughters to Heav’n’s man-enlight’ning Fire,"
7610,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Perse, whom Oceanus begat,"
7611,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The ship-fit port here soon we landed at,"
7612,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some God directing us. Two days, two nights,"
7613,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,We lay here pining in the fatal spights
7614,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of toil and sorrow; but the next third day
7615,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When fair Aurora had inform’d, quick way"
7616,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I made out of my ship, my sword and lance"
7617,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Took for my surer guide, and made advance"
7618,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Up to a prospect; I assay to see
7619,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The works of men, or hear mortality"
7620,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Exspire a voice. When I had climb’d a height,"
7621,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rough and right hardly accessible, I might"
7622,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Behold from Circe’s house, that in a grove"
7623,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Set thick with trees stood, a bright vapour move,"
7624,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I then grew curious in my thought to try[5]
7625,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some fit inquiry, when so spritely fly"
7626,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I saw the yellow smoke; but my discourse[6]
7627,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A first retiring to my ship gave force,"
7628,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To give my men their dinner, and to send"
7629,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Before th’ adventure of myself) some friend.
7630,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Being near my ship, of one so desolate"
7631,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some God had pity, and would recreate"
7632,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My woes a little, putting up to me"
7633,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A great and high-palm’d hart, that (fatally,"
7634,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Just in my way itself to taste a flood)
7635,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was then descending; the sun heat had sure
7636,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Importun’d him, besides the temperature"
7637,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His natural heat gave. Howsoever, I"
7638,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made up to him, and let my jav’lin fly,"
7639,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That struck him through the mid-part of his chine,"
7640,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And made him, braying, to the dust confine"
7641,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His flying forces. Forth his spirit flew;
7642,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When I stept in, and from the death’s wound drew"
7643,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My shrewdly-bitten lance; there let him lie
7644,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Till I, of cut-up osiers, did imply"
7645,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A withe a fathom long, with which his feet"
7646,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I made together in a sure league meet,"
7647,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stoop’d under him, and to my neck I heav’d"
7648,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The mighty burden, of which I receiv’d"
7649,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A good part on my lance, for else I could"
7650,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By no means with one hand alone uphold
7651,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Join’d with one shoulder) such a deathful load.
7652,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And so, to both my shoulders, both hands stood"
7653,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Needful assistants; for it was a deer
7654,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Goodly-well-grown. When (coming something near
7655,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where rode my ships) I cast it down, and rear’d"
7656,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My friends with kind words; whom by name I cheer’d,"
7657,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In note particular, and said: ‘See, friends,"
7658,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,We will not yet to Pluto’s house; our ends
7659,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall not be hasten’d, though we be declin’d"
7660,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In cause of comfort, till the day design’d"
7661,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By Fate’s fix’d finger. Come, as long as food"
7662,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or wine lasts in our ship, let’s spirit our blood,"
7663,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And quit our care and hunger both in one.’
7664,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, they frolick’d, came, and look’d upon"
7665,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With admiration the huge-bodied beast;
7666,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And when their first-serv’d eyes had done their feast,"
7667,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They wash’d, and made a to-be-striv’d-for meal[7]"
7668,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In point of honour. On which all did dwell
7669,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The whole day long. And, to our venison’s store,"
7670,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,We added wine till we could wish no more.
7671,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sun set, and darkness up, we slept, till light"
7672,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Put darkness down; and then did I excite
7673,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My friends to counsel, utt’ring this: ‘Now, friends,[8]"
7674,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Afford unpassionate ear; though ill Fate lends
7675,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So good cause to your passion, no man knows"
7676,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The reason whence and how the darkness grows;
7677,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The reason how the morn is thus begun;
7678,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The reason how the man-enlight’ning sun
7679,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Dives under earth; the reason how again
7680,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He rears his golden head. Those counsels, then,"
7681,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That pass our comprehension, we must leave"
7682,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To him that knows their causes; and receive
7683,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Direction from him in our acts, as far"
7684,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As he shall please to make them regular,"
7685,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And stoop them to our reason. In our state
7686,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What then behoves us? Can we estimate,"
7687,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all our counsels, where we are? Or know"
7688,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Without instruction, past our own skills) how,"
7689,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Put off from hence, to steer our course the more?"
7690,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I think we cannot. We must then explore
7691,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,These parts for information; in which way
7692,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,We thus far are: Last morn I might display
7693,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(From off a high-rais’d cliff) an island lie
7694,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Girt with th’ unmeasur’d sea, and is so nigh"
7695,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That in the midst I saw the smoke arise
7696,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Through tufts of trees. This rests then to advise,"
7697,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who shall explore this?’ This struck dead their hearts,"
7698,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Rememb’ring the most execrable parts
7699,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That Læstrygonian Antiphas had play’d,"
7700,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And that foul Cyclop that their fellows bray’d
7701,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Betwixt his jaws; which mov’d them so, they cried."
7702,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But idle tears had never wants supplied.
7703,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I in two parts divided all, and gave"
7704,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To either part his captain. I must have
7705,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The charge of one; and one of God-like look,"
7706,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eurylochus, the other. Lots we shook,"
7707,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Put in a casque together, which of us"
7708,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Should lead th’ attempt; and ’twas Eurylochus.
7709,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He freely went, with two-and-twenty more;"
7710,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All which took leave with tears; and our eyes wore
7711,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The same wet badge of weak humanity.
7712,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These in a dale did Circe’s house descry,"
7713,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of bright stone built, in a conspicuous way."
7714,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before her gates hill-wolves, and lions, lay;"
7715,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which with her virtuous drugs so tame she made,"
7716,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That wolf nor lion would one man invade
7717,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With any violence, but all arose,"
7718,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their huge long tails wagg’d, and in fawns would close,"
7719,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As loving dogs, when masters bring them home"
7720,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Relics of feast, in all observance come,"
7721,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And soothe their entries with their fawns and bounds,"
7722,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All guests still bringing some scraps for their hounds;
7723,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So, on these men, the wolves and lions ramp’d,"
7724,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their horrid paws set up. Their spirits were damp’d
7725,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To see such monstrous kindness, stay’d at gate,"
7726,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And heard within the Goddess elevate
7727,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A voice divine, as at her web she wrought,"
7728,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Subtle, and glorious, and past earthly thought,"
7729,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As all the housewif’ries of Deities are.
7730,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To hear a voice so ravishingly rare,"
7731,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Polités (one exceeding dear to me,"
7732,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A prince of men, and of no mean degree"
7733,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In knowing virtue, in all acts whose mind[9]"
7734,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Discreet cares all ways us’d to turn, and wind)"
7735,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was yet surpris’d with it, and said: ‘O friends,"
7736,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some one abides within here, that commends"
7737,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The place to us, and breathes a voice divine,"
7738,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As she some web wrought, or her spindle’s twine"
7739,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,She cherish’d with her song; the pavement rings
7740,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With imitation of the tunes she sings.
7741,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some woman, or some Goddess, ’tis. Assay"
7742,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To see with knocking.’ Thus said he, and they"
7743,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both knock’d, and call’d; and straight her shining gates"
7744,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She open’d, issuing, bade them in to cates."
7745,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Led, and unwise, they follow’d; all but one,"
7746,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which was Eurylochus, who stood alone"
7747,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Without the gates, suspicious of a sleight."
7748,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They enter’d, she made sit; and her deceit"
7749,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She cloak’d with thrones, and goodly chairs of state;"
7750,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Set herby honey, and the delicate"
7751,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wine brought from Smynra, to them; meal and cheese;"
7752,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But harmful venoms she commix’d with these,"
7753,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That made their country vanish from their thought.
7754,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which eat, she touch’d them with a rod that wrought"
7755,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their transformation far past human wonts;
7756,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Swine’s snouts, swine’s bodies, took they, bristles, grunts,"
7757,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But still retain’d the souls they had before,"
7758,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which made them mourn their bodies’ change the more.
7759,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She shut them straight in styes, and gave them meat,"
7760,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Oak-mast, and beech, and cornel-fruit, they eat,"
7761,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Grov’lling like swine on earth, in foulest sort."
7762,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Eurylochus straight hasted the report
7763,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of this his fellows’ most remorseful fate,"
7764,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Came to the ships, but so excruciate"
7765,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was with his woe, he could not speak a word,"
7766,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His eyes stood full of tears, which show’d how stor’d"
7767,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His mind with moan remain’d. We all admir’d,"
7768,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ask’d what had chanc’d him, earnestly desir’d"
7769,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He would resolve us. At the last, our eyes"
7770,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Enflam’d in him his fellows’ memories,[10]"
7771,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And out his grief burst thus: ‘You will’d; we went
7772,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Through those thick woods you saw; when a descent
7773,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Show’d us a fair house, in a lightsome ground,"
7774,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where, at some work, we heard a heav’nly sound"
7775,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Breath’d from a Goddess’, or a woman’s, breast."
7776,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They knock’d, she op’d her bright gates; each her guest"
7777,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her fair invitement made; nor would they stay,"
7778,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fools that they were, when she once led the way."
7779,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I enter’d not, suspecting some deceit."
7780,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When all together vanish’d, nor the sight"
7781,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of anyone (though long I look’d) mine eye
7782,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Could any way discover.’ Instantly,"
7783,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My sword and bow reach’d, I bad show the place,"
7784,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When down he fell, did both my knees embrace,"
7785,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And pray’d with tears thus: ‘O thou kept of God,"
7786,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Do not thyself lose, nor to that abode"
7787,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lead others rashly; both thyself, and all"
7788,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou ventur’st thither, I know well, must fall"
7789,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In one sure ruin. With these few then fly;
7790,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,We yet may shun the others’ destiny.’
7791,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I answer’d him: ‘Eurylochus! Stay thou,"
7792,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And keep the ship then, eat and drink; I now"
7793,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Will undertake th’ adventure; there is cause
7794,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In great Necessity’s unalter’d laws.’
7795,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, I left both ship and seas, and on"
7796,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Along the sacred valleys all alone
7797,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Went in discov’ry, till at last I came"
7798,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Where of the main-med’cine-making Dame
7799,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I saw the great house; where encounter’d me
7800,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The golden-rod-sustaining Mercury,"
7801,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ev’n ent’ring Circe’s doors. He met me in
7802,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A young man’s likeness, of the first-flow’r’d chin,"
7803,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whose form hath all the grace of one so young.
7804,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He first call’d to me, then my hand he wrung,"
7805,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said: ‘Thou no-place-finding-for-repose,"
7806,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whither, alone, by these hill-confines, goes"
7807,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy erring foot? Th’ art ent’ring Circe’s house,"
7808,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where, by her med’cines, black, and sorcerous,"
7809,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy soldiers all are shut in well-arm’d styes,"
7810,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And turn’d to swine. Art thou arriv’d with prize
7811,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fit for their ransoms? Thou com’st out no more,"
7812,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If once thou ent’rest, like thy men before"
7813,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made to remain here. But I’ll guard thee free,"
7814,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And save thee in her spite. Receive of me
7815,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This fair and good receipt; with which once arm’d,"
7816,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Enter her roofs, for th’ art to all proof charm’d"
7817,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Against the ill day. I will tell thee all
7818,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her baneful counsel: With a festival
7819,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She’ll first receive thee, but will spice thy bread"
7820,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With flow’ry poisons; yet unalteréd
7821,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall thy firm form be, for this remedy"
7822,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stands most approv’d ’gainst all her sorcery,"
7823,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which thus particularly shun: When she
7824,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall with her long rod strike thee, instantly"
7825,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Draw from thy thigh thy sword, and fly on her"
7826,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As to her slaughter. She, surpris’d with fear"
7827,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And love, at first, will bid thee to her bed."
7828,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor say the Goddess nay, that welcoméd"
7829,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou may’st with all respect be, and procure"
7830,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy fellows’ freedoms. But before, make sure"
7831,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her favours to thee; and the great oath take
7832,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With which the blesséd Gods assurance make
7833,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all they promise; that no prejudice
7834,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(By stripping thee of form, and faculties)"
7835,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,She may so much as once attempt on thee.’
7836,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he gave his antidote to me,"
7837,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which from the earth he pluck’d, and told me all"
7838,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The virtue of it, with what Deities call"
7839,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The name it bears; and Moly[11] they impose
7840,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For name to it. The root is hard to loose
7841,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From hold of earth by mortals; but God’s pow’r
7842,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Can all things do. ’Tis black, but bears a flow’r"
7843,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As white as milk. And thus flew Mercury
7844,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up to immense Olympus, gliding by"
7845,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The sylvan island. I made back my way
7846,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Circe’s house, my mind of my assay"
7847,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Much thought revolving. At her gates I stay’d
7848,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And call’d; she heard, and her bright doors display’d,"
7849,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Invited, led; I follow’d in, but trac’d"
7850,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With some distraction. In a throne she plac’d
7851,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My welcome person; of a curious frame
7852,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"’Twas, and so bright I sat as in a flame;"
7853,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A foot-stool added. In a golden bowl
7854,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She then suborn’d a potion, in her soul"
7855,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Deform’d things thinking; for amidst the wine
7856,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,She mix’d her man-transforming medicine;
7857,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which when she saw I had devour’d, she then"
7858,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No more observ’d me with her soothing vein,"
7859,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But struck me with her rod, and to her stye"
7860,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bad, out, away, and with thy fellows lie."
7861,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I drew my sword, and charg’d her, as I meant"
7862,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To take her life. When out she cried, and bent"
7863,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beneath my sword her knees, embracing mine,"
7864,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, full of tears, said: ‘Who? Of what high line"
7865,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Art thou the issue? Whence? What shores sustain
7866,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy native city? I amaz’d remain
7867,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, drinking these my venoms, th’ art not turn’d."
7868,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Never drunk any this cup but be mourn’d
7869,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In other likeness, if it once had pass’d"
7870,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The ivory bounders of his tongue and taste.
7871,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All but thyself are brutishly declin’d.
7872,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy breast holds firm yet, and unchang’d thy mind."
7873,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thou canst be therefore none else but the man
7874,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of many virtues, Ithacensian,"
7875,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Deep-soul’d, Ulysses, who; I oft was told,"
7876,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By that sly God that bears the rod of gold,"
7877,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was to arrive here in retreat from Troy.
7878,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sheathe then thy sword, and let my bed enjoy"
7879,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So much a man, that when the bed we prove,"
7880,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,We may believe in one another’s love.’
7881,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I then: ‘O Circe, why entreat’st thou me"
7882,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To mix in any human league with thee,"
7883,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When thou my friends hast beasts turn’d; and thy bed
7884,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tender’st to me, that I might likewise lead"
7885,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A beast’s life with thee, soften’d, naked stripp’d,"
7886,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That in my blood thy banes may more be steep’d?
7887,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I never will ascend thy bed, before,"
7888,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I may affirm, that in heav’n’s sight you swore"
7889,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The great oath of the Gods, that all attempt"
7890,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To do me ill is from your thoughts exempt.’
7891,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I said, she swore, when, all the oath-rites said,"
7892,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I then ascended her adornéd bed,"
7893,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But thus prepar’d: Four handmaids served her there,"
7894,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That daughters to her silver fountains were,"
7895,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To her bright-sea-observing sacred floods,"
7896,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And to her uncut consecrated woods.
7897,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One deck’d the throne-tops with rich cloths of state,"
7898,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And did with silks the foot-pace consecrate.
7899,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Another silver tables set before
7900,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The pompous throne, and golden dishes’ store"
7901,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Serv’d in with sev’ral feast. A third fill’d wine.
7902,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fourth brought water, and made fuel shine"
7903,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In ruddy fires beneath a womb of brass.
7904,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which heat, I bath’d; and od’rous water was"
7905,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Disperpled lightly on my head and neck,"
7906,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That might my late heart-hurting sorrows check
7907,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With the refreshing sweetness; and, for that,"
7908,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Men sometimes may be something delicate.
7909,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bath’d, and adorn’d, she led me to a throne"
7910,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of massy silver, and of fashión"
7911,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Exceeding curious. A fair foot-stool set,"
7912,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Water appos’d, and ev’ry sort of meat"
7913,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Set on th’ elaborately-polish’d board,"
7914,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,She wish’d my taste employ’d; but not a word
7915,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Would my ears taste of taste; my mind had food
7916,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That must digest; eye-meat would do me good.
7917,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Circe (observing that I put no hand
7918,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To any banquet, having countermand"
7919,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From weightier cares the light cates could excuse)
7920,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bowing her near me, these wing’d words did use;"
7921,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘Why sits Ulysses like one dumb, his mind"
7922,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Less’ning with languors? Nor to food inclin’d,"
7923,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor wine? Whence comes it? Out of any fear
7924,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of more illusion? You must needs forbear
7925,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That wrongful doubt, since you have heard me swear.’"
7926,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘O Circe!’ I replied, ‘what man is he,"
7927,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Aw’d with the rights of true humanity,"
7928,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That dares taste food or wine, before he sees"
7929,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His friends redeem’d from their deformities?
7930,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If you be gentle, and indeed incline"
7931,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To let me taste the comfort of your wine,"
7932,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dissolve the charms that their forc’d forms enchain,"
7933,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And show me here my honour’d friends like men.’
7934,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, she left her throne, and took her rod,"
7935,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Went to her stye, and let my men abroad,"
7936,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like swine of nine years old. They opposite stood,"
7937,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Observ’d their brutish form, and look’d for food;"
7938,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When, with another med’cine, ev’ry one"
7939,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All over smear’d, their bristles all were gone,"
7940,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Produc’d by malice of the other bane,"
7941,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ev’ry one, afresh, look’d up a man,"
7942,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both younger than they were, of stature more,"
7943,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all their forms much goodlier than before.
7944,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All knew me, cling’d about me, and a cry"
7945,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of pleasing mourning flew about so high
7946,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The horrid roof resounded; and the queen
7947,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Herself was mov’d to see our kind so keen,"
7948,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who bad me now bring ship and men ashore,"
7949,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our arms, and goods in caves hid, and restore"
7950,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Myself to her, with all my other men."
7951,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I granted, went, and op’d the weeping vein"
7952,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In all my men; whose violent joy to see
7953,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My safe return was passing kindly free
7954,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of friendly tears, and miserably wept."
7955,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You have not seen young heifers (highly kept,"
7956,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fill’d full of daisies at the field, and driv’n"
7957,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Home to their hovels, all so spritely giv’n"
7958,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That no room can contain them, but about"
7959,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bace by the dams, and let their spirits out"
7960,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In ceaseless bleating) of more jocund plight
7961,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Than my kind friends, ev’n crying out with sight"
7962,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of my return so doubted; circled me
7963,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all their welcomes, and as cheerfully"
7964,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dispos’d their rapt minds, as if there they saw"
7965,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their natural country, cliffy Ithaca,"
7966,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ev’n the roofs where they were bred and born,"
7967,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And vow’d as much, with tears; ‘O your return"
7968,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As much delights us as in you had come
7969,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our country to us, and our natural home."
7970,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But what unhappy fate hath reft our friends?’
7971,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I gave unlook’d-for answer, that amends"
7972,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made for their mourning, bad them first of all"
7973,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our ship ashore draw, then in caverns stall"
7974,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our foody cattle, hide our mutual prize,"
7975,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"῾And then,᾿ said I, ῾attend me, that your eyes,"
7976,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In Circe’s sacred house, may see each friend"
7977,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Eating and drinking banquets out of end.᾿
7978,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They soon obey’d; all but Eurylochus,"
7979,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who needs would stay them all, and counsell’d thus:"
7980,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,῾O wretches! whither will ye? Why are you
7981,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fond of your mischiefs, and such gladness show"
7982,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For Circe’s house, that will transform ye all"
7983,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To swine, or wolves, or lions? Never shall"
7984,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our heads get out, if once within we be,"
7985,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But stay compell’d by strong necessity.
7986,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So wrought the Cyclop, when t’ his cave our friends"
7987,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This bold one led on, and brought all their ends"
7988,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By his one indiscretion.᾿ I for this
7989,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thought with my sword (that desp’rate head of his
7990,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Hewn from his neck) to gash upon the ground
7991,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His mangled body, though my blood was bound"
7992,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In near alliance to him. But the rest
7993,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With humble suit contain’d me, and request,"
7994,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That I would leave him with my ship alone,"
7995,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And to the sacred palace lead them on.
7996,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I led them; nor Eurylochus would stay
7997,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From their attendance on me, our late fray"
7998,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Struck to his heart so. But mean time, my men,"
7999,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In Circe’s house, were all, in sev’ral bain,"
8000,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Studiously sweeten’d, smug’d with oil, and deck’d"
8001,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With in and out weeds, and a feast secret"
8002,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Serv’d in before them; at which close we found
8003,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They all were set, cheer’d, and carousing round,"
8004,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When mutual sight had, and all thought on, then"
8005,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Feast was forgotten, and the moan again[12]"
8006,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About the house flew, driv’n with wings of joy."
8007,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But then spake Circe: ‘Now, no more annoy,"
8008,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I know myself what woes by sea, and shore,"
8009,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And men unjust have plagued enough before
8010,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your injur’d virtues. Here then feast as long,"
8011,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And be as cheerful, till ye grow as strong"
8012,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As when ye first forsook your country-earth.
8013,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ye now fare all like exiles; not a mirth,"
8014,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Flash’d in amongst ye, but is quench’d again"
8015,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With still-renew’d tears, though the beaten vein"
8016,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of your distresses should, me think, be now"
8017,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Benumb with suff’rance.’ We did well allow
8018,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her kind persuasions, and the whole year stay’d"
8019,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In varied feast with her. When, now array’d"
8020,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The world was with the spring, and orby hours"
8021,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had gone the round again through herbs and flow’rs,"
8022,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The months absolv’d in order, till the days"
8023,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Had run their full race in Apollo’s rays;
8024,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My friends remember’d me of home, and said;"
8025,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If ever fate would sign my pass, delay’d"
8026,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It should be now no more. I heard them well,"
8027,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet that day spent in feast, till darkness fell,"
8028,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And sleep his virtues through our vapours shed.
8029,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When I ascended sacred Circe’s bed,"
8030,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Implor’d my pass, and her performéd vow"
8031,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which now my soul urg’d, and my soldiers now"
8032,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Afflicted me with tears to get them gone.
8033,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All these I told her, and she answer’d these:"
8034,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“Much-skill’d Ulysses Laertiades!
8035,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Remain no more against your wills with me,"
8036,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But take your free way; only this must be
8037,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Perform’d before you steer your course for home:
8038,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You must the way to Pluto overcome,"
8039,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And stern Persephoné, to form your pass,"
8040,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By th’ aged Theban soul Tiresias,"
8041,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The dark-brow’d prophet, whose soul yet can see"
8042,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Clearly, and firmly; grave Persephoné,"
8043,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n dead, gave him a mind, that he alone"
8044,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Might sing truth’s solid wisdom, and not one"
8045,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Prove more than shade in his comparison.᾿
8046,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This broke my heart; I sunk into my bed,"
8047,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mourn’d, and would never more be comforted"
8048,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With light, nor life. But having now exprest"
8049,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My pains enough to her in my unrest,"
8050,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That so I might prepare her ruth, and get"
8051,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All I held fit for an affair so great,"
8052,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I said: ‘O Circe, who shall steer my course"
8053,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To Pluto’s kingdom? Never ship had force
8054,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To make that voyage.’ The divine-in-voice
8055,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Said; ‘Seek no guide, raise you your mast, and hoise"
8056,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your ship’s white sails, and then sit yon at peace,"
8057,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The fresh North Spirit shall waft ye through the Seas.
8058,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, having past the ocean, you shall see"
8059,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A little shore, that to Persephoné"

8398,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His passion to thee, that thy foe, the Sea,"
8399,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall not enforce it, but Death’s victory"
8400,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall chance in only-earnest-pray-vow’d age,[4]"
8401,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Obtain’d at home, quite emptied of his rage,"
8402,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy subjects round about thee, rich and blest."
8403,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And here hath Truth summ’d up thy vital rest.’
8404,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I answer’d him: ‘We will suppose all these
8405,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Decreed in Deity; let it likewise please
8406,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tiresias to resolve me, why so near"
8407,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The blood and me my mother’s soul doth bear,"
8408,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yet nor word, nor look, vouchsafe her son?"
8409,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Doth she not know me?’ ‘No,’ said he, ‘nor none"
8410,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all these spirits, but myself alone,"
8411,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Knows anything till he shall taste the blood.
8412,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But whomsoever you shall do that good,"
8413,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He will the truth of all you wish unfold;
8414,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Who you envy it to will all withhold.’
8415,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus said the kingly soul, and made retreat"
8416,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amidst the inner parts of Pluto’s seat,"
8417,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When he had spoke thus by divine instinct.
8418,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Still I stood firm, till to the blood’s precinct"
8419,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My mother came, and drunk; and then she knew"
8420,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I was her son, had passion to renew"
8421,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her natural plaints, which thus she did pursue:"
8422,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘How is it, O my son, that you alive"
8423,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This deadly-darksome region underdive?
8424,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"’Twixt which, and earth, so many mighty seas,"
8425,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And horrid currents, interpose their prease,"
8426,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Oceanus in chief? Which none (unless
8427,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,More help’d than you) on foot now can transgress.
8428,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A well-built ship he needs that ventures there.
8429,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Com’st thou from Troy but now, enforc’d to err"
8430,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All this time with thy soldiers? Nor hast seen,"
8431,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ere this long day, thy country, and thy queen?’"
8432,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I answer’d: ‘That a necessary end
8433,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To this infernal state made me contend;
8434,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That from the wise Tiresias’ Theban soul
8435,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I might an oracle involv’d unroll;
8436,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For I came nothing near Achaia yet,"
8437,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor on our lov’d earth happy foot had set,"
8438,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, mishaps suff’ring, err’d from coast to coast,"
8439,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ever since first the mighty Grecian host
8440,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Divine Atrides led to Ilion,"
8441,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And I his follower, to set war upon"
8442,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The rapeful Trojans; and so pray’d she would
8443,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fate of that ungentle death unfold,"
8444,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That forc’d her thither; if some long disease,"
8445,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or that the spleen of her-that-arrows-please,"
8446,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Diana, envious of most eminent dames,"
8447,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Had made her th’ object of her deadly aims?
8448,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My father’s state and sons I sought, if they"
8449,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Kept still my goods? Or they became the prey
8450,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of any other, holding me no more"
8451,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In pow’r of safe return? Or if my store
8452,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My wife had kept together with her son?
8453,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If she her first mind held, or had been won"
8454,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By some chief Grecian from my love and bed?’
8455,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All this she answer’d: ‘That affliction fed
8456,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On her blood still at home, and that to grief"
8457,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,She all the days and darkness of her life
8458,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In tears had consecrate. That none possest
8459,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My famous kingdom’s throne, but th’ interest"
8460,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My son had in it still he held in peace,"
8461,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A court kept like a prince, and his increase"
8462,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Spent in his subjects’ good, administ’ring laws"
8463,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With justice, and the general applause"
8464,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A king should merit, and all call’d him king."
8465,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My father kept the upland, labouring,"
8466,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And shunn’d the city, us’d no sumptuous beds,"
8467,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wonder’d-at furnitures, nor wealthy weeds,"
8468,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But in the winter strew’d about the fire
8469,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lay with his slaves in ashes, his attire"
8470,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like to a beggar’s; when the summer came,"
8471,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And autumn all fruits ripen’d with his flame,"
8472,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where grape-charg’d vines made shadows most abound,"
8473,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His couch with fall’n leaves made upon the ground,"
8474,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And here lay he, his sorrow’s fruitful state"
8475,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Increasing as he faded for my fate;
8476,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And now the part of age that irksome is
8477,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Lay sadly on him. And that life of his
8478,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She led, and perish’d in; not slaughter’d by"
8479,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Dame that darts lov’d, and her archery;"
8480,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor by disease invaded, vast and foul,"
8481,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That wastes the body, and sends out the soul"
8482,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With shame and horror; only in her moan,"
8483,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For me and my life, she consum’d her own.’"
8484,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She thus, when I had great desire to prove"
8485,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My arms the circle where her soul did move.
8486,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thrice prov’d I, thrice she vanish’d like a sleep,"
8487,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or fleeting shadow, which struck much more deep"
8488,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The wounds my woes made, and made ask her why"
8489,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She would my love to her embraces fly,"
8490,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And not vouchsafe that ev’n in hell we might
8491,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pay pious Nature her unalter’d right,"
8492,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And give Vexation here her cruel fill?
8493,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Should not the Queen here, to augment the ill"
8494,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of ev’ry suff’rance, which her office is,"
8495,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Enforce thy idol to afford me this?
8496,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘O son,’ she answer’d, ‘of the race of men"
8497,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The most unhappy, our most equal Queen"
8498,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will mock no solid arms with empty shade,"
8499,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor suffer empty shades again t’ invade
8500,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Flesh, bones, and nerves; nor will defraud the fire"
8501,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his last dues, that, soon as spirits expire"
8502,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And leave the white bone, are his native right,"
8503,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When, like a dream, the soul assumes her flight."
8504,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The light then of the living with most haste,"
8505,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O son, contend to. This thy little taste"
8506,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of this state is enough; and all this life
8507,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Will make a tale fit to be told thy wife.’
8508,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This speech we had; when now repair’d to me
8509,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"More female spirits, by Persephoné"
8510,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Driv’n on before her. All th’ heroës’ wives,"
8511,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And daughters, that led there their second lives,"
8512,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About the black blood throng’d. Of whom yet more
8513,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My mind impell’d me to inquire, before"
8514,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I let them all together taste the gore,"
8515,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For then would all have been dispers’d, and gone"
8516,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thick as they came. I, therefore, one by one"
8517,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let taste the pit, my sword drawn from my thigh,"
8518,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And stand betwixt them made, when, sev’rally,"
8519,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All told their stocks. The first, that quench’d her fire,"
8520,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was Tyro, issued of a noble sire."
8521,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She said she sprung from pure Salmoneus’ bed,"
8522,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Cretheus, son of Æolus, did wed;"
8523,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet the divine flood Enipëus lov’d,"
8524,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Who much the most fair stream of all floods mov’d.
8525,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Near whose streams Tyro walking, Neptune came,"
8526,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like Enipëus, and enjoy’d the dame."
8527,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like to a hill, the blue and snaky flood"
8528,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Above th’ immortal and the mortal stood,"
8529,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And hid them both, as both together lay,"
8530,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Just where his current falls into the sea.
8531,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her virgin waist dissolv’d, she slumber’d then;"
8532,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But when the God had done the work of men,"
8533,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her fair hand gently wringing, thus he said:"
8534,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘Woman! rejoice in our combinéd bed,"
8535,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For when the year hath run his circle round
8536,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Because the Gods’ loves must in fruit abound)
8537,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My love shall make, to cheer thy teeming moans,"
8538,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy one dear burden bear two famous sons;
8539,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Love well, and bring them up. Go home, and see"
8540,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, though of more joy yet I shall be free,"
8541,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou dost not tell, to glorify thy birth;"
8542,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy love is Neptune, shaker of the earth.’"
8543,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he plung’d into the sea; and she,"
8544,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Begot with child by him, the light let see"
8545,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Great Pelias, and Neleus, that became"
8546,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In Jove’s great ministry of mighty fame.
8547,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pelias in broad Iolcus held his throne,"
8548,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Wealthy in cattle; th’ other royal son
8549,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Rul’d sandy Pylos. To these issue more
8550,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This queen of women to her husband bore,"
8551,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Æson, and Pheres, and Amythaon"
8552,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That for his fight on horseback stoop’d to none.
8553,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Next her, I saw admir’d Antiope,"
8554,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Asopus’ daughter, who (as much as she"
8555,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Boasted attraction of great Neptune’s love)
8556,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Boasted to slumber in the arms of Jove,"
8557,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And two sons likewise at one burden bore
8558,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To that her all-controlling paramour,"
8559,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amphion, and fair Zethus; that first laid"
8560,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Great Thebes’ foundations, and strong walls convey’d"
8561,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About her turrets, that seven ports enclos’d,"
8562,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For though the Thebans much in strength repos’d,"
8563,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet had not they the strength to hold their own,"
8564,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Without the added aids of wood and stone.
8565,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Alcmena next I saw, that famous wife"
8566,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was to Amphitryo, and honour’d life"
8567,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Gave to the lion-hearted Hercules,"
8568,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That was of Jove’s embrace the great increase.
8569,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I saw, besides, proud Creon’s daughter there,"
8570,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bright Megara, that nuptial yoke did wear"
8571,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With Jove’s great son, who never field did try"
8572,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But bore to him the flow’r of victory.
8573,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The mother then of Œdipus I saw,"
8574,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fair Epicasta, that, beyond all law,"
8575,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her own son married, ignorant of kind."
8576,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And he, as darkly taken in his mind,"
8577,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His mother wedded, and his father slew."
8578,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose blind act Heav’n expos’d at length to view,"
8579,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And he in all-lov’d Thebes the supreme state
8580,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With much moan manag’d, for the heavy fate"
8581,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Gods laid on him. She made violent flight
8582,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Pluto’s dark house from the loathéd light,"
8583,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beneath a steep beam strangled with a cord,"
8584,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And left her son, in life, pains as abhorr’d"
8585,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As all the Furies pour’d on her in hell.
8586,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then saw I Chloris, that did so excell"
8587,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In answering beauties, that each part had all."
8588,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Great Neleus married her, when gifts not small"
8589,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had won her favour, term’d by name of dow’r."
8590,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,She was of all Amphion’s seed the flow’r;
8591,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amphion, call’d Iasides, that then"
8592,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rul’d strongly Myniæan Orchomen,"
8593,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And now his daughter rul’d the Pylian throne,"
8594,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Because her beauty’s empire overshone.
8595,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She brought her wife-awed husband, Neleús,"
8596,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nestor much honour’d, Periclymenus,"
8597,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Chromius, sons with sov’reign virtues grac’d;"
8598,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But after brought a daughter that surpass’d,"
8599,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rare-beautied Pero, so for form exact"
8600,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That Nature to a miracle was rack’d
8601,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In her perfections, blaz’d with th’ eyes of men;"
8602,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That made of all the country’s hearts a chain,"
8603,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And drew them suitors to her. Which her sire
8604,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Took vantage of, and, since he did aspire"
8605,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To nothing more than to the broad-brow’d herd
8606,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of oxen, which the common fame so rear’d,"
8607,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Own’d by Iphiclus, not a man should be"
8608,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His Pero’s husband, that from Phylace"
8609,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Those never-yet-driv’n oxen could not drive.
8610,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet these a strong hope held him to achieve,"
8611,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Because a prophet, that had never err’d,"
8612,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had said, that only he should be preferr’d"
8613,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To their possession. But the equal fate
8614,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of God withstood his stealth; inextricate
8615,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Imprisoning bands, and sturdy churlish swains"
8616,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That were the herdsmen, who withheld with chains"
8617,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The stealth-attempter; which was only he
8618,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That durst abet the act with prophecy,"
8619,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"None else would undertake it, and he must;"
8620,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The king would needs a prophet should be just.
8621,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But when some days and months expired were,"
8622,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all the hours had brought about the year,"
8623,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The prophet did so satisfy the king
8624,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Iphiclus, all his cunning questioning)"
8625,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That he enfranchis’d him; and, all worst done,"
8626,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Jove’s counsel made th’ all-safe conclusión.
8627,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then saw I Leda, link’d in nuptial chain"
8628,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With Tyndarus, to whom she did sustain"
8629,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sons much renown’d for wisdom; Castor one,"
8630,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That pass’d for use of horse comparison;
8631,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Pollux, that excell’d in whirlbat fight;"
8632,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both these the fruitful earth bore, while the light"
8633,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of life inspir’d them; after which, they found"
8634,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Such grace with Jove, that both liv’d under ground,"
8635,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By change of days; life still did one sustain,"
8636,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"While th’ other died; the dead then liv’d again,"
8637,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The living dying; both of one self date
8638,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their lives and deaths made by the Gods and Fate.
8639,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Iphimedia after Leda came,"
8640,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That did derive from Neptune too the name
8641,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of father to two admirable sons.
8642,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Life yet made short their admiratións,"
8643,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who God-opposéd Otus had to name,"
8644,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And Ephialtes far in sound of fame.
8645,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The prodigal earth so fed them, that they grew"
8646,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To most huge stature, and had fairest hue"
8647,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all men, but Orion, under heav’n."
8648,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,At nine years old nine cubits they were driv’n
8649,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Abroad in breadth, and sprung nine fathoms high."
8650,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They threaten’d to give battle to the sky,"
8651,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all th’ Immortals. They were setting on
8652,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ossa upon Olympus, and upon"
8653,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Steep Ossa leavy Pelius, that ev’n"
8654,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They might a highway make with lofty heav’n;
8655,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And had perhaps perform’d it, had they liv’d"
8656,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Till they were striplings; but Jove’s son depriv’d
8657,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their limbs of life, before th’ age that begins"
8658,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The flow’r of youth, and should adorn their chins."
8659,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Phædra and Procris, with wise Minos’ flame,"
8660,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bright Ariadne, to the off’ring came."
8661,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom whilome Theseus made his prise from Crete,"
8662,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That Athens’ sacred soil might kiss her feet,"
8663,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But never could obtain her virgin flow’r,"
8664,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Till, in the sea-girt Dia, Dian’s pow’r"
8665,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Detain’d his homeward haste, where (in her fane,"
8666,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By Bacchus witness’d) was the fatal wane
8667,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of her prime glory, Mæra, Clymene,"
8668,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I witness’d there; and loath’d Eriphyle,"
8669,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That honour’d gold more than she lov’d her spouse.[5]
8670,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, all th’ heroesses in Pluto’s house"
8671,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That then encounter’d me, exceeds my might"
8672,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To name or number, and ambrosian night"
8673,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would quite be spent, when now the formal hours"
8674,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Present to sleep our all disposéd pow’rs,"
8675,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If at my ship, or here. My home-made vow"
8676,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I leave for fit grace to the Gods and you.”
8677,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This said; the silence his discourse had made
8678,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With pleasure held still through the house’s shade,"
8679,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When white-arm’d Areté this speech began:
8680,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Phæacians! How appears to you this man,"
8681,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So goodly person’d, and so match’d with mind?"
8682,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My guest he is, but all you stand combin’d"
8683,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In the renown he doth us. Do not then
8684,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With careless haste dismiss him, nor the main"
8685,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his dispatch to one so needy maim,"
8686,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Gods’ free bounty gives us all just claim
8687,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To goods enow.” This speech, the oldest man"
8688,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of any other Phæacensian,"
8689,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The grave heroë, Echinëus, gave"
8690,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All approbation, saying: “Friends! ye have"
8691,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The motion of the wise queen in such words
8692,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As have not miss’d the mark, with which accords"
8693,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My clear opinion. But Alcinous,"
8694,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In word and work, must be our rule.” He thus;"
8695,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then Alcinous said: “This then must stand,"
8696,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,If while I live I rule in the command
8697,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of this well-skill’d-in-navigation state:
8698,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Endure then, guest, though most importunate"
8699,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Be your affects for home. A little stay
8700,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If your expectance bear, perhaps it may"
8701,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our gifts make more complete. The cares of all
8702,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your due deduction asks; but principal
8703,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I am therein the ruler.” He replied:
8704,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Alcinous, the most duly glorified"
8705,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With rule of all of all men, if you lay"
8706,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Commandment on me of a whole year’s stay,"
8707,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So all the while your preparations rise,"
8708,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As well in gifts as time,[6] ye can devise"
8709,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,No better wish for me; for I shall come
8710,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Much fuller-handed, and more honoured, home,"
8711,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And dearer to my people, in whose loves"
8712,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The richer evermore the better proves.”
8713,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He answer’d: “There is argued in your sight
8714,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A worth that works not men for benefit,"
8715,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like prollers or impostors; of which crew,"
8716,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The gentle black earth feeds not up a few,"
8717,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Here and there wand’rers, blanching tales and lies,"
8718,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of neither praise, nor use. You move our eyes"
8719,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With form, our minds with matter, and our ears"
8720,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With elegant oration, such as bears"
8721,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A music in the order’d history
8722,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It lays before us. Not Demodocus

8724,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All the Greek sorrows, wept out in your own."
8725,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But say: Of all your worthy friends, were none"
8726,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Objected to your eyes that consorts were
8727,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Ilion with you, and serv’d destiny there?"
8728,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This night is passing long, unmeasur’d, none"
8729,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all my household would to bed yet; on,"
8730,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Relate these wondrous things. Were I with you,"
8731,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If you would tell me but your woes, as now,"
8732,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Till the divine Aurora show’d her head,"
8733,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I should in no night relish thought of bed.”
8734,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Most eminent king,” said he, “times all must keep,"
8735,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There’s time to speak much, time as much to sleep."
8736,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But would you hear still, I will tell you still,"
8737,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And utter more, more miserable ill"
8738,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of friends than yet, that scap’d the dismal wars,"
8739,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And perish’d homewards, and in household jars"
8740,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Wag’d by a wicked woman. The chaste Queen
8741,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No sooner made these lady ghosts unseen,"
8742,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Here and there flitting, but mine eyesight won"
8743,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The soul of Agamemnon, Atreus’ son,"
8744,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sad, and about him all his train of friends,"
8745,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That in Ægisthus’ house endur’d their ends
8746,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With his stern fortune. Having drunk the blood,"
8747,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He knew me instantly, and forth a flood"
8748,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of springing tears gush’d; out he thrust his hands,"
8749,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With will t’ embrace me, but their old commands"
8750,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Flow’d not about him, nor their weakest part."
8751,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I wept to see, and moan’d him from my heart,"
8752,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And ask’d: ‘O Agamemnon! King of men!
8753,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,What sort of cruel death hath render’d slain
8754,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy royal person? Neptune in thy fleet
8755,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Heav’n and his hellish billows making meet,"
8756,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Rousing the winds? Or have thy men by land
8757,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Done thee this ill, for using thy command,"
8758,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Past their consents, in diminution"
8759,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of those full shares their worths by lot had won
8760,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of sheep or oxen? Or of any town,"
8761,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In covetous strife, to make their rights thine own"
8762,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In men or women prisoners?’ He replied:
8763,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘By none of these in any right I died,"
8764,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But by Ægisthus and my murd’rous wife
8765,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Bid to a banquet at his house) my life
8766,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hath thus been reft me, to my slaughter led"
8767,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Like to an ox pretended to be fed.
8768,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So miserably fell I, and with me"
8769,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My friends lay massacred, as when you see"
8770,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At any rich man’s nuptials, shot, or feast,"
8771,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About his kitchen white-tooth’d swine lie drest.
8772,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The slaughters of a world of men thine eyes,"
8773,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both private, and in prease of enemies,"
8774,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Have personally witness’d; but this one
8775,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would all thy parts have broken into moan,"
8776,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To see how strew’d about our cups and cates,"
8777,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As tables set with feast, so we with fates,"
8778,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All gash’d and slain lay, all the floor embrued"
8779,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With blood and brain. But that which most I rued,"
8780,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Flew from the heavy voice that Priam’s seed,"
8781,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cassandra, breath’d, whom, she that wit doth feed"
8782,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With baneful crafts, false Clytemnestra, slew,"
8783,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Close sitting by me; up my hands I threw
8784,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From earth to heav’n, and tumbling on my sword"
8785,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Gave wretched life up; when the most abhorr’d,"
8786,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By all her sex’s shame, forsook the room,"
8787,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor deign’d, though then so near this heavy home,"
8788,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To shut my lips, or close my broken eyes."
8789,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nothing so heap’d is with impieties,"
8790,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As such a woman that would kill her spouse
8791,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That married her a maid. When to my house
8792,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I brought her, hoping of her love in heart,"
8793,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To children, maids, and slaves. But she (in th’ art"
8794,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of only mischief hearty) not alone
8795,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cast on herself this foul aspersión,"
8796,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But loving dames, hereafter, to their lords"
8797,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will bear, for good deeds, her bad thoughts and words.’"
8798,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘Alas,’ said I, ‘that Jove should hate the lives"
8799,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of Atreus’ seed so highly for their wives!
8800,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For Menelaus’ wife a number fell,"
8801,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For dang’rous absence thine sent thee to hell.’
8802,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘For this,’ he answer’d, ‘be not thou more kind"
8803,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Than wise to thy wife. Never all thy mind
8804,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let words express to her. Of all she knows,"
8805,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Curbs for the worst still, in thyself repose."
8806,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But thou by thy wife’s wiles shalt lose no blood,"
8807,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Exceeding wise she is, and wise in good."
8808,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Icarius’ daughter, chaste Penelope,"
8809,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We left a young bride, when for battle we"
8810,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Forsook the nuptial peace, and at her breast"
8811,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her first child sucking, who, by this hour, blest,"
8812,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Sits in the number of surviving men.
8813,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And his bliss she hath, that she can contain,"
8814,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And her bliss thou hast, that she is so wise."
8815,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For, by her wisdom, thy returnéd eyes"
8816,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall see thy son, and he shall greet his sire"
8817,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With fitting welcomes; when in my retire,"
8818,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My wife denies mine eyes my son’s dear sight,"
8819,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, as from me, will take from him the light,"
8820,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before she adds one just delight to life,"
8821,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or her false wit one truth that fits a wife.
8822,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For her sake therefore let my harms advise,"
8823,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That though thy wife be ne’er so chaste and wise,"
8824,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet come not home to her in open view,[7]"
8825,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With any ship or any personal show,"
8826,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But take close shore disguis’d, nor let her know,"
8827,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For ’tis no world to trust a woman now.
8828,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But what says Fame? Doth my son yet survive,"
8829,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In Orchomen, or Pylos? Or doth live"
8830,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In Sparta with his uncle? Yet I see
8831,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Divine Orestes is not here with me.’
8832,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I answer’d, asking: ‘Why doth Atreus’ son"
8833,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Enquire of me, who yet arriv’d where none"
8834,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Could give to these news any certain wings?
8835,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And ’tis absurd to tell uncertain things.’
8836,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Such sad speech past us; and as thus we stood,"
8837,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With kind tears rend’ring unkind fortunes good,"
8838,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Achilles’ and Patroclus’ soul appear’d,"
8839,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And his soul, of whom never ill was heard,"
8840,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The good Antilochus, and the soul of him"
8841,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That all the Greeks past both for force and limb,"
8842,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Excepting the unmatch’d Æacides,"
8843,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Illustrious Ajax. But the first of these
8844,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That saw, acknowledg’d, and saluted me,"
8845,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was Thetis’ conqu’ring son, who (heavily"
8846,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His state here taking) said: ‘Unworthy breath!
8847,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,What act yet mightier imagineth
8848,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy vent’rous spirit? How dost thou descend
8849,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These under-regions, where the dead man’s end"
8850,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is to be look’d on, and his foolish shade?’"
8851,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I answer’d him: ‘I was induc’d t’ invade
8852,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These under-parts, most excellent of Greece,"
8853,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To visit wise Tiresias, for advice"
8854,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of virtue to direct my voyage home
8855,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To rugged Ithaca; since I could come
8856,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To note in no place, where Achaia stood,"
8857,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And so liv’d ever, tortur’d with the blood"
8858,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In man’s vain veins. Thou, therefore, Thetis’ son,"
8859,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hast equall’d all, that ever yet have won"
8860,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The bliss the earth yields, or hereafter shall."
8861,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In life thy eminence was ador’d of all,"
8862,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n with the Gods; and now, ev’n dead, I see"
8863,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy virtues propagate thy empery
8864,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To a renew’d life of command beneath;
8865,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So great Achilles triumphs over death.’
8866,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This comfort of him this encounter found;
8867,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘Urge not my death to me, nor rub that wound,"
8868,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I rather wish to live in earth a swain,"
8869,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or serve a swain for hire, that scarce can gain"
8870,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bread to sustain him, than, that life once gone,"
8871,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all the dead sway the imperial throne.
8872,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But say, and of my son some comfort yield,"
8873,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If he goes on in first fights of the field,"
8874,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or lurks for safety in the obscure rear?
8875,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or of my father if thy royal ear
8876,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hath been advertis’d, that the Phthian throne"
8877,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He still commands, as greatest Myrmidon?"
8878,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or that the Phthian and Thessalian rage
8879,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Now feet and hands are in the hold of age)
8880,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Despise his empire? Under those bright rays,"
8881,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In which heav’n’s fervour hurls about the days.
8882,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Must I no more shine his revenger now,"
8883,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Such as of old the Ilion overthrow
8884,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Witness’d my anger, th’ universal host"
8885,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sending before me to this shady coast,"
8886,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In fight for Grecia. Could I now resort,"
8887,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(But for some small time) to my father’s court,"
8888,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In spirit and pow’r as then, those men should find"
8889,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My hands inaccessible, and of fire my mind,"
8890,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That durst with all the numbers they are strong
8891,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Unseat his honour, and suborn his wrong.’"
8892,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This pitch still flew his spirit, though so low,"
8893,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And this I answer’d thus: ‘I do not know
8894,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of blameless Peleus any least report,"
8895,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But of your son, in all the utmost sort,"
8896,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I can inform your care with truth, and thus:"
8897,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From Scyros princely Neoptolemus
8898,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By fleet I convey’d to the Greeks, where he"
8899,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was chief, at both parts, when our gravity"
8900,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Retir’d to council, and our youth to fight."
8901,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In council still so fiery was Conceit
8902,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his quick apprehension of a cause,"
8903,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That first he ever spake, nor pass’d the laws"
8904,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of any great stay, in his greatest haste."
8905,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"None would contend with him, that counsell’d last,"
8906,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Unless illustrious Nestor, he and I"
8907,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Would sometimes put a friendly contrary
8908,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On his opinion. In our fights, the prease"
8909,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of great or common, he would never cease,"
8910,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But far before fight ever. No man there,"
8911,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For force, he forcéd. He was slaughterer"
8912,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of many a brave man in most dreadful fight.
8913,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But one and other whom he reft of light,"
8914,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In Grecian succour, I can neither name,"
8915,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor give in number. The particular fame
8916,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of one man’s slaughter yet I must not pass;
8917,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eurypylus Telephides he was,"
8918,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That fell beneath him, and with him the falls"
8919,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of such huge men went, that they show’d like whales[8]"
8920,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Rampir’d about him. Neoptolemus
8921,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Set him so sharply, for the sumptuous"
8922,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Favours of mistresses he saw him wear;
8923,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For past all doubt his beauties had no peer
8924,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all that mine eyes noted, next to one,"
8925,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And that was Memnon, Tithon’s Sun-like son."
8926,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus far, for fight in public, may a taste"
8927,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Give of his eminence. How far surpast
8928,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His spirit in private, where he was not seen,"
8929,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor glory could be said to praise his spleen,"
8930,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This close note I excerpted. When we sat
8931,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hid in Epëus’ horse, no optimate"
8932,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all the Greeks there had the charge to ope
8933,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And shut the stratagem but I.[9] My scope
8934,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To note then each man’s spirit in a strait
8935,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of so much danger, much the better might"
8936,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Be hit by me, than others, as, provok’d,"
8937,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I shifted place still, when, in some I smok’d"
8938,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both privy tremblings, and close vent of tears,"
8939,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In him yet not a soft conceit of theirs
8940,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Could all my search see, either his wet eyes"
8941,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ply’d still with wipings, or the goodly guise,"
8942,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His person all ways put forth, in least part,"
8943,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By any tremblings, show’d his touch’d-at heart."
8944,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But ever he was urging me to make
8945,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Way to their sally, by his sign to shake"
8946,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His sword hid in his scabbard, or his lance"
8947,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Loaded with iron, at me. No good chance"
8948,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His thoughts to Troy intended. In th’ event,"
8949,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"High Troy depopulate, he made ascent"
8950,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his fair ship, with prise and treasure store,"
8951,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Safe, and no touch away with him he bore"
8952,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of far-off-hurl’d lance, or of close-fought sword,"
8953,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose wounds for favours war doth oft afford,"
8954,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which he (though sought) miss’d in war’s closest wage.
8955,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"_In close fights Mars doth never fight, but rage.’_"
8956,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This made the soul of swift Achilles tread
8957,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A march of glory through the herby mead,"
8958,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For joy to hear me so renown his son;
8959,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And vanish’d stalking. But with passión
8960,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stood th’ other souls struck, and each told his bane."
8961,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Only the spirit Telamonian[10]
8962,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Kept far off, angry for the victory"
8963,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I won from him at fleet; though arbitry
8964,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all a court of war pronounc’d it mine,"
8965,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And Pallas’ self. Our prise were th’ arms divine
8966,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of great Æacides, proposd t’ our fames"
8967,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By his bright Mother, at his funeral games."
8968,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I wish to heav’n I ought not to have won;
8969,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since for those arms so high a head so soon
8970,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The base earth cover’d, Ajax, that of all"
8971,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The host of Greece had person capital,"
8972,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And acts as eminent, excepting his"
8973,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose arms those were, in whom was nought amiss."
8974,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I tried the great soul with soft words, and said:"
8975,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘Ajax! Great son of Telamon, array’d"
8976,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In all our glories! What! not dead resign
8977,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy wrath for those curst arms? The Pow’rs divine
8978,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In them forg’d all our banes, in thine own one,"
8979,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In thy grave fall our tower was overthrown.
8980,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We mourn, for ever maim’d, for thee as much"
8981,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As for Achilles; nor thy wrong doth touch,"
8982,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In sentence, any but Saturnius’ doom;"
8983,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In whose hate was the host of Greece become
8984,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A very horror; who express’d it well
8985,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In signing thy fate with this timeless hell.
8986,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Approach then, king of all the Grecian merit,"
8987,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Repress thy great mind and thy flamy spirit,"
8988,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And give the words I give thee worthy ear.’
8989,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All this no word drew from him, but less near"
8990,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The stern soul kept; to other souls he fled,"
8991,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And glid along the river of the dead.
8992,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though anger mov’d him, yet he might have spoke,"
8993,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since I to him. But my desires were strook
8994,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With sight of other souls. And then I saw
8995,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Minos, that minister’d to Death a law,"
8996,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Jove’s bright son was. He was set, and sway’d"
8997,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A golden sceptre; and to him did plead
8998,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A sort of others, set about his throne,"
8999,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In Pluto’s wide-door’d house; when straight came on
9000,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mighty Orion, who was hunting there"
9001,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The herds of those beasts he had slaughter’d here
9002,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In desert hills on earth. A club he bore,"
9003,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Entirely steel, whose virtues never wore."
9004,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tityus I saw, to whom the glorious earth"
9005,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Open’d her womb, and gave unhappy birth."
9006,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upwards, and flat upon the pavement, lay"
9007,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His ample limbs, that spread in their display"
9008,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nine acres’ compass. On his bosom sat
9009,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Two vultures, digging, through his caul of fat,"
9010,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Into his liver with their crookéd beaks;
9011,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And each by turns the concrete entrail breaks
9012,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(As smiths their steel beat) set on either side.
9013,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor doth he ever labour to divide
9014,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His liver and their beaks, nor with his hand"
9015,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Offer them off, but suffers by command"
9016,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of th’ angry Thund’rer, off’ring to enforce"
9017,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His love Latona, in the close recourse"
9018,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She us’d to Pytho through the dancing land,"
9019,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Smooth Panopëus. I saw likewise stand,"
9020,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up to the chin, amidst a liquid lake,"
9021,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tormented Tantalus, yet could not slake"
9022,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His burning thirst. Oft as his scornful cup
9023,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Th’ old man would taste, so oft ’twas swallow’d up,"
9024,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all the black earth to his feet descried,"
9025,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Divine pow’r (plaguing him) the lake still dried.
9026,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About his head, on high trees, clust’ring, hung"
9027,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pears, apples, granates, olives ever-young,"
9028,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Delicious figs, and many fruit-trees more"
9029,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of other burden; whose alluring store
9030,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When th’ old soul striv’d to pluck, the winds from sight,"
9031,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In gloomy vapours, made them vanish quite."
9032,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There saw I Sisyphus in infinite moan,"
9033,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With both hands heaving up a massy stone,"
9034,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And on his tip-toes racking all his height,"
9035,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To wrest up to a mountain-top his freight;
9036,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When prest to rest it there, his nerves quite spent,"
9037,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Down rush’d the deadly quarry, the event"
9038,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all his torture new to raise again;
9039,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To which straight set his never-rested pain.
9040,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The sweat came gushing out from ev’ry pore
9041,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And on his head a standing mist he wore,"
9042,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Reeking from thence, as if a cloud of dust"
9043,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Were rais’d about it. Down with these was thrust
9044,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The idol of the force of Hercules,"
9045,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But his firm self did no such fate oppress,"
9046,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He feasting lives amongst th’ Immortal States,"
9047,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,White-ankled Hebe and himself made mates
9048,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In heav’nly nuptials. Hebe, Jove’s dear race,"
9049,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And Juno’s whom the golden sandals grace.
9050,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About him flew the clamours of the dead
9051,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like fowls, and still stoop’d cuffing at his head."
9052,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He with his bow, like Night, stalk’d up and down,"
9053,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His shaft still nock’d, and hurling round his frown"
9054,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At those vex’d hov’rers, aiming at them still,"
9055,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And still, as shooting out, desire to still."
9056,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A horrid bawdrick wore he thwart his breast,"
9057,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The thong all-gold, in which were forms imprest,"
9058,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where art and miracle drew equal breaths,"
9059,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In bears, boars, lions, battles, combats, deaths,"
9060,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who wrought that work did never such before,"
9061,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor so divinely will do ever more.
9062,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Soon as he saw, he knew me, and gave speech:"
9063,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘Son of Laertes, high in wisdom’s reach,"
9064,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yet unhappy wretch, for in this heart,"
9065,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all exploits achiev’d by thy desert,"
9066,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy worth but works out some sinister fate,"
9067,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As I in earth did. I was generate
9068,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By Jove himself, and yet past mean opprest"
9069,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By one my far inferior, whose proud hest"
9070,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Impos’d abhorréd labours on my hand.
9071,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all which one was, to descend this strand,"
9072,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And hale the dog from thence. He could not think
9073,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,An act that danger could make deeper sink.
9074,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yet this depth I drew, and fetch’d as high,"
9075,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As this was low, the dog. The Deity"
9076,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of sleight and wisdom, as of downright pow’r,"
9077,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both stoop’d, and rais’d, and made me conqueror.’"
9078,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he made descent again as low"
9079,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As Pluto’s court; when I stood firm, for show"
9080,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of more heroës of the times before,"
9081,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And might perhaps have seen my wish of more,"
9082,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(As Theseus and Pirithous, deriv’d"
9083,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From roots of Deity) but before th’ achiev’d
9084,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rare sight of these, the rank-soul’d multitude"
9085,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In infinite flocks rose, venting sounds so rude,"
9086,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That pale Fear took me, lest the Gorgon’s head"
9087,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rush’d in amongst them, thrust up, in my dread,"
9088,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By grim Persephoné. I therefore sent
9089,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My men before to ship, and after went."
9090,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where, boarded, set, and launch’d, the ocean wave"
9091,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our oars and forewinds speedy passage gave.

9150,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When here arriv’d, we drew her up to land,"
9151,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And trod ourselves the re-saluted sand,"
9152,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Found on the shore fit resting for the night,"

9186,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, for the time, our fortunes were so wise"
9187,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To follow wise directions. All that day
9188,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,We sat and feasted. When his lower way
9189,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Sun had entered, and the Even the high,"
9190,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My friends slept on their gables; she and I
9191,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Led by her fair hand to place apart,"
9192,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By her well-sorted) did to sleep convert
9193,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our timid pow’rs; when all things Fate let fall
9194,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In our affair she ask’d; I told her all.
9195,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To which she answer’d: ‘These things thus took end.
9196,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And now to those that I inform attend,"
9197,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which you rememb’ring, God himself shall be"
9198,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The blesséd author of your memory.
9199,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"First to the Sirens ye shall come, that taint"
9200,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The minds of all men whom they can acquaint
9201,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With their attractions. Whosoever shall,"

9204,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both wife and children, for their sorceries,"
9205,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That never home turns his affection’s stream,"
9206,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor they take joy in him, nor he in them."
9207,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Sirens will so soften with their song
9208,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Shrill, and in sensual appetite so strong)"
9209,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His loose affections, that he gives them head."
9210,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then observe: They sit amidst a mead,"
9211,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And round about it runs a hedge or wall
9212,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of dead men’s bones, their wither’d skins and all"
9213,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Hung all along upon it; and these men
9214,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were such as they had fawn’d into their fen,"
9215,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And then their skins hung on their hedge of bones.
9216,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sail by them therefore, thy companions"
9217,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Beforehand causing to stop ev’ry ear
9218,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With sweet soft wax, so close that none may hear"
9219,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A note of all their charmings. Yet may you,"
9220,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If you affect it, open ear allow"
9221,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To try their motion; but presume not so
9222,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To trust your judgment, when your senses go"
9223,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So loose about you, but give strait command"
9224,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all your men, to bind you foot and hand"
9225,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sure to the mast, that you may safe approve"
9226,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,How strong in instigation to their love
9227,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their rapting tunes are. If so much they move,"
9228,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, spite of all your reason, your will stands"
9229,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To be enfranchis’d both of feet and hands,"
9230,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Charge all your men before to slight your charge,"
9231,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And rest so far from fearing to enlarge
9232,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That much more sure they bind you. When your friends
9233,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Have outsail’d these, the danger that transcends"
9234,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rests not in any counsel to prevent,"
9235,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Unless your own mind finds the tract and bent
9236,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of that way that avoids it. I can say
9237,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That in your course there lies a twofold way,"
9238,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The right of which your own, taught, present wit,"
9239,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And grace divine, must prompt. In gen’ral yet"
9240,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Let this inform you: Near these Sirens’ shore
9241,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Move two steep rocks, at whose feet lie and roar"
9242,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The black sea’s cruel billows; the bless’d Gods
9243,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Call them the Rovers. Their abhorr’d abodes
9244,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No bird can pass; no not the doves, whose fear[1]"
9245,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Sire Jove so loves that they are said to bear
9246,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ambrosia to him, can their ravine ’scape,"
9247,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But one of them falls ever to the rape
9248,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of those sly rocks; yet Jove another still
9249,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Adds to the rest, that so may ever fill"
9250,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The sacred number. Never ship could shun
9251,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The nimble peril wing’d there, but did run"
9252,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all her bulk, and bodies of her men,"
9253,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To utter ruin. For the seas retain
9254,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not only their outrageous æsture there,"
9255,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But fierce assistants of particular fear,"
9256,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And supernatural mischief, they exspire,"
9257,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And those are whirlwinds of devouring fire
9258,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whisking about still. Th’ Argive ship alone,"
9259,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which bore the care of all men, got her gone,[2]"
9260,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Come from Areta. Yet perhaps ev’n she
9261,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had wrack’d at those rocks, if the Deity,"
9262,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That lies by Jove’s side, had not lent her hand"
9263,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To their transmission; since the man, that mann’d"
9264,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In chief that voyage, she in chief did love."
9265,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of these two spiteful rocks, the one doth shove"
9266,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Against the height of heav’n her pointed brow.
9267,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A black cloud binds it round, and never show"
9268,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Lends to the sharp point; not the clear blue sky
9269,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lets ever view it, not the summer’s eye,"
9270,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor fervent autumn’s. None that death could end
9271,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Could ever scale it, or, if up, descend,"
9272,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though twenty hands and feet he had for hold,"
9273,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A polish’d ice-like glibness doth enfold
9274,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The rock so round, whose midst a gloomy cell"
9275,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Shrouds so far westward that it sees to hell.
9276,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From this keep you as far, as from his bow"
9277,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,An able young man can his shaft bestow.
9278,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For here the whuling Scylla shrouds her face,[3]"
9279,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That breathes a voice at all parts no more base
9280,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Than are a newly-kitten’d kitling’s cries,"
9281,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Herself a monster yet of boundless size,"
9282,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose sight would nothing please a mortal’s eyes,"
9283,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No nor the eyes of any God, if he"
9284,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Whom nought should fright) fell foul on her, and she"
9285,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her full shape show’d. Twelve foul feet bear about
9286,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her ugly bulk. Six huge long necks look out
9287,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of her rank shoulders; ev’ry neck doth let
9288,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A ghastly head out; ev’ry head three set,"
9289,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thick thrust together, of abhorréd teeth,"
9290,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And ev’ry tooth stuck with a sable death.
9291,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She lurks in midst of all her den, and streaks"
9292,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From out a ghastly whirlpool all her necks;
9293,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where, gloting round her rock, to fish she falls;"
9294,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And up rush dolphins, dogfish; somewhiles whales"
9295,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,If got within her when her rapine feeds;
9296,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For ever-groaning Amphitrite breeds
9297,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About her whirlpool an unmeasur’d store.
9298,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,No sea-man ever boasted touch of shore
9299,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That there touch’d with his ship, but still she fed"
9300,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of him and his; a man for ev’ry head
9301,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Spoiling his ship of. You shall then descry
9302,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The other humbler rock, that moves so nigh"
9303,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your dart may mete the distance. It receives
9304,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A huge wild fig-tree, curl’d with ample leaves,"
9305,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beneath whose shades divine Charybdis sits,"
9306,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Supping the black deeps. Thrice a day her pits
9307,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She drinking all dry, and thrice a day again"
9308,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All up she belches, baneful to sustain."
9309,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When she is drinking, dare not near her draught,"
9310,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For not the force of Neptune, if once caught,"
9311,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Can force your freedom. Therefore, in your strife"
9312,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To ’scape Charybdis, labour all for life"
9313,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To row near Scylla, for she will but have"
9314,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For her six heads six men; and better save
9315,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The rest, than all make off’rings to the wave.’"
9316,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This need she told me of my loss, when I"
9317,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Desir’d to know, if that Necessity,"
9318,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When I had ’scap’d Charybdis’ outrages,"
9319,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My pow’rs might not revenge, though not redress?"
9320,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,She answer’d: ‘O unhappy! art thou yet
9321,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Enflam’d with war, and thirst to drink thy sweat?"
9322,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Not to the Gods give up both arms and will?
9323,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She deathless is, and that immortal ill"
9324,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Grave, harsh, outrageous, not to be subdued,"
9325,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That men must suffer till they be renew’d.
9326,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor lives there any virtue that can fly
9327,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The vicious outrage of their cruelty.
9328,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shouldst thou put arms on, and approach the rock,"
9329,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I fear six more must expiate the shock.
9330,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Six heads six men ask still. Hoise sail, and fly,"
9331,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, in thy flight, aloud on Cratis cry"
9332,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Great Scylla’s mother, who expos’d to light"
9333,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The bane of men) and she will do such right
9334,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To thy observance, that she down will tread"
9335,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her daughter’s rage, nor let her show a head."
9336,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From thenceforth then, for ever past her care,"
9337,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou shalt ascend the isle triangular,"
9338,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where many oxen of the Sun are fed,"
9339,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And fatted flocks. Of oxen fifty head
9340,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In ev’ry herd feed, and their herds are seven;"
9341,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And of his fat flocks is their number even.
9342,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Increase they yield not, for they never die."
9343,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,There ev’ry shepherdess a Deity.
9344,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fair Phaëthusa, and Lampetié,"
9345,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The lovely Nymphs are that their guardians be,"
9346,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Who to the daylight’s lofty-going Flame
9347,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had gracious birthright from the heav’nly Dame,"
9348,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Still young Neæra; who (brought forth and bred)
9349,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Far off dismiss’d them, to see duly fed"
9350,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their father’s herds and flocks in Sicily.
9351,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,These herds and flocks if to the Deity
9352,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ye leave, as sacred things, untouch’d, and on"
9353,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Go with all fit care of your home, alone,"
9354,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Though through some suff’rance) you yet safe shall land
9355,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In wishéd Ithaca. But if impious hand
9356,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You lay on those herds to their hurts, I then"
9357,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Presage sure ruin to thy ship and men.
9358,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If thou escap’st thyself, extending home"
9359,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy long’d-for landing, thou shalt loaded come"
9360,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With store of losses, most exceeding late,"
9361,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And not consorted with a savéd mate.’
9362,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, the golden-thron’d Aurora rose,"
9363,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She her way went, and I did mine dispose"
9364,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up to my ship, weigh’d anchor, and away."
9365,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When rev’rend Circe help’d us to convey
9366,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our vessel safe, by making well inclin’d"
9367,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A seaman’s true companion, a forewind,"
9368,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With which she fill’d our sails; when, fitting all"
9369,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our arms close by us, I did sadly fall"
9370,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To grave relation what concern’d in fate
9371,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My friends to know, and told them that the state"
9372,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of our affairs’ success, which Circe had"
9373,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Presag’d to me alone, must yet be made"
9374,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To one nor only two known, but to all;"
9375,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, since their lives and deaths were left to fall"
9376,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In their elections, they might life elect,"
9377,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And give what would preserve it fit effect.
9378,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I first inform’d them, that we were to fly"
9379,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The heav’nly-singing Sirens’ harmony,"
9380,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And flow’r-adorned meadow; and that I
9381,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had charge to hear their song, but fetter’d fast"
9382,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In bands, unfavour’d, to th’ erected mast,"
9383,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From whence, if I should pray, or use command,"
9384,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To be enlarg’d, they should with much more band"
9385,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Contain my strugglings. This I simply told
9386,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To each particular, nor would withhold"
9387,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What most enjoin’d mine own affection’s stay,"
9388,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That theirs the rather might be taught t’ obey.
9389,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In mean time flew our ships, and straight we fetch’d"
9390,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Siren’s isle; a spleenless wind so stretch’d
9391,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her wings to waft us, and so urg’d our keel."
9392,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But having reach’d this isle, we could not feel"
9393,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The least gasp of it, it was stricken dead,"
9394,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all the sea in prostrate slumber spread,"
9395,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Sirens’ devil charm’d all. Up then flew
9396,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My friends to work, struck sail, together drew,"
9397,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And under hatches stow’d them, sat, and plied"
9398,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The polish’d oars, and did in curls divide"
9399,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The white-head waters. My part then came on:
9400,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A mighty waxen cake I set upon,"
9401,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Chopp’d it in fragments with my sword, and wrought"
9402,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With strong hand ev’ry piece, till all were soft."
9403,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The great pow’r of the sun, in such a beam"
9404,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As then flew burning from his diadem,"
9405,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To liquefaction help’d us. Orderly
9406,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I stopp’d their ears; and they as fair did ply
9407,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My feet and hands with cords, and to the mast"
9408,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With other halsers made me soundly fast.
9409,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then took they seat, and forth our passage strook,"
9410,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The foamy sea beneath their labour shook.
9411,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Row’d on, in reach of an erected voice,"
9412,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Sirens soon took note, without our noise,"
9413,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tun’d those sweet accents that made charms so strong,"
9414,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And these learn’d numbers made the Sirens’ song:
9415,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"_‘Come here, thou worthy of a world of praise,"
9416,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That dost so high the Grecian glory raise,"
9417,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses! stay thy ship, and that song hear"
9418,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That none pass’d ever but it bent his ear,"
9419,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But left him ravish’d, and instructed more"
9420,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By us, than any ever heard before."
9421,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For we know all things whatsoever were
9422,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In wide Troy labour’d; whatsoever there
9423,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Grecians and the Trojans both sustain’d
9424,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By those high issues that the Gods ordain’d.
9425,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And whatsoever all the earth can show
9426,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"T’ inform a knowledge of desert, we know.’_"
9427,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This they gave accent in the sweetest strain
9428,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That ever open’d an enamour’d vein.
9429,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When my constrain’d heart needs would have mine ear
9430,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet more delighted, force way forth, and hear."
9431,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To which end I commanded with all sign
9432,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Stern looks could make (for not a joint of mine
9433,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had pow’r to stir) my friends to rise, and give"
9434,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My limbs free way. They freely striv’d to drive
9435,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their ship still on. When, far from will to loose,"
9436,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Eurylochus and Perimedes rose
9437,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To wrap me surer, and oppress’d me more"
9438,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With many a halser than had use before.
9439,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When, rowing on without the reach of sound,"
9440,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My friends unstopp’d their ears, and me unbound,"
9441,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And that isle quite we quitted. But again
9442,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Fresh fears employ’d us. I beheld a main
9443,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of mighty billows, and a smoke ascend,"
9444,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A horrid murmur hearing. Ev’ry friend
9445,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Astonish’d sat; from ev’ry hand his Oar
9446,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Fell quite forsaken; with the dismal roar
9447,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Were all things there made echoes; stone-still stood
9448,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our ship itself, because the ghastly flood"
9449,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Took all men’s motions from her in their own.
9450,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I through the ship went, labouring up and down"
9451,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My friends’ recover’d spirits. One by one
9452,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I gave good words, and said: That well were known"
9453,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These ills to them before, I told them all,"
9454,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And that these could not prove more capital
9455,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Than those the Cyclops block’d us up in, yet"
9456,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My virtue, wit, and heav’n-help’d counsels set"
9457,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their freedoms open. I could not believe
9458,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But they remember’d it, and wish’d them give"
9459,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My equal care and means now equal trust.
9460,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The strength they had for stirring up they must
9461,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rouse and extend, to try if Jove had laid"
9462,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His pow’rs in theirs up, and would add his aid"
9463,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To ’scape ev’n that death. In particular then,"
9464,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I told our pilot, that past other men"
9465,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He most must bear firm spirits, since he sway’d"
9466,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The continent that all our spirits convey’d,"
9467,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In his whole guide of her. He saw there boil
9468,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The fiery whirlpools that to all our spoil
9469,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Inclos’d a rock, without which he must steer,"
9470,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or all our ruins stood concluded there.
9471,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All heard me and obey’d, and little knew"
9472,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, shunning that rock, six of them should rue"
9473,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The wrack another hid. For I conceal’d
9474,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The heavy wounds, that never would be heal’d,"
9475,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To be by Scylla open’d; for their fear
9476,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would then have robb’d all of all care to steer,"
9477,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or stir an oar, and made them hide beneath,"
9478,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When they and all had died an idle death.
9479,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But then ev’n I forgot to shun the harm
9480,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Circe forewarn’d; who will’d I should not arm,"
9481,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor show myself to Scylla, lest in vain"
9482,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I ventur’d life. Yet could not I contain,"
9483,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But arm’d at all parts, and two lances took,"
9484,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up to the foredeck went, and thence did look"
9485,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That rocky Scylla would have first appear’d
9486,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And taken my life with the friends I fear’d.
9487,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From thence yet no place could afford her sight,"
9488,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though through the dark rock mine eye threw her light,"
9489,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And ransack’d all ways. I then took a strait
9490,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That gave myself, and some few more, receit"
9491,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,’Twixt Scylla and Charybdis; whence we saw
9492,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,How horridly Charybdis’ throat did draw
9493,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The brackish sea up, which when all aboard"
9494,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She spit again out, never caldron sod"
9495,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With so much fervour, fed with all the store"
9496,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That could enrage it; all the rock did roar
9497,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With troubled waters; round about the tops
9498,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all the steep crags flew the foamy drops.
9499,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But when her draught the sea and earth dissunder’d,"
9500,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The troubled bottoms turn’d up, and she thunder’d,"
9501,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Far under shore the swart sands naked lay.
9502,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whose whole stern sight the startled blood did fray
9503,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From all our faces. And while we on her
9504,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our eyes bestow’d thus to our ruin’s fear,"
9505,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Six friends had Scylla snatch’d out of our keel,"
9506,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In whom most loss did force and virtue feel.
9507,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When looking to my ship, and lending eye"
9508,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To see my friends’ estates, their heels turn’d high,"
9509,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And hands cast up, I might discern, and hear"
9510,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their calls to me for help, when now they were"
9511,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To try me in their last extremities.
9512,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And as an angler med’cine for surprise
9513,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of little fish sits pouring from the rocks,"
9514,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From out the crook’d horn of a fold-bred ox,"
9515,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And then with his long angle hoists them high
9516,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up to the air, then slightly hurls them by,"
9517,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When helpless sprawling on the land they lie;
9518,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So eas’ly Scylla to her rock had rapt
9519,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My woeful friends, and so unhelp’d entrapt"
9520,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Struggling they lay beneath her violent rape,"
9521,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who in their tortures, desp’rate of escape,"
9522,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shriek’d as she tore, and up their hands to me"
9523,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Still threw for sweet life. I did never see,"
9524,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all my suff’rance ransacking the seas,"
9525,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A spectacle so full of miseries.
9526,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus having fled these rocks (these cruel dames
9527,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Scylla, Charybdis) where the King of flames"
9528,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hath off’rings burn’d to him, our ship put in"
9529,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The island that from all the earth doth win
9530,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The epithet _Faultless,_ where the broad-of-head"
9531,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And famous oxen for the Sun are fed,"
9532,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With many fat flocks of that high-gone God.
9533,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Set in my ship, mine ear reach’d where we rode"
9534,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The bellowing of oxen, and the bleat"
9535,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of fleecy sheep, that in my memory’s seat"
9536,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Put up the forms that late had been imprest
9537,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By dread Ææn Circe, and the best"
9538,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of souls and prophets, the blind Theban seer,"
9539,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The wise Tiresias, who was grave decreer"
9540,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of my return’s whole means; of which this one
9541,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In chief he urg’d—that I should always shun
9542,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The island of the man-delighting Sun.
9543,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When, sad at heart for our late loss, I pray’d"
9544,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My friends to hear fit counsel (though dismay’d
9545,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With all ill fortunes) which was giv’n to me
9546,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By Circe’s and Tiresias’ prophecy,—"
9547,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That I should fly the isle where was ador’d
9548,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Comfort of the world, for ills abhorr’d"
9549,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Were ambush’d for us there; and therefore will’d
9550,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They should put off and leave the isle. This kill’d
9551,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their tender spirits; when Eurylochus
9552,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A speech that vex’d me utter’d, answ’ring thus:"
9553,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,‘Cruel Ulysses! Since thy nerves abound
9554,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In strength, the more spent, and no toils confound"
9555,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy able limbs, as all beat out of steel,"
9556,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou ablest us too, as unapt to feel"
9557,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The teeth of Labour, and the spoil of Sleep,"
9558,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore still wet waste us in the deep,"
9559,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor let us land to eat, but madly now"
9560,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In night put forth, and leave firm land to strew"
9561,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The sea with errors. All the rabid flight
9562,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of winds that ruin ships are bred in night.
9563,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who is it that can keep off cruel Death,"
9564,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,If suddenly should rush out th’ angry breath
9565,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Notus, or the eager-spirited West,"
9566,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That cuff ships dead, and do the Gods their best?"
9567,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Serve black Night still with shore, meat, sleep, and ease,"
9568,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And offer to the Morning for the seas.’
9569,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This all the rest approv’d, and then knew I"
9570,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That past all doubt the Devil did apply
9571,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His slaught’rous works. Nor would they be withheld;
9572,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I was but one, nor yielded but compell’d."
9573,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But all that might contain them I assay’d,"
9574,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A sacred oath on all their pow’rs I laid,"
9575,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That if with herds or any richest-flocks
9576,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We chanc’d t’ encounter, neither sheep nor ox"
9577,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We once should touch, nor (for that constant ill"
9578,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That follows folly) scorn advice and kill,"
9579,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But quiet sit us down and take such food
9580,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As the immortal Circe had bestow’d.
9581,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They swore all this in all severest sort;
9582,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And then we anchor’d in the winding port
9583,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Near a fresh river, where the long’d-for shore"
9584,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They all flew out to, took in victuals store,"
9585,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, being full, thought of their friends, and wept"
9586,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their loss by Scylla, weeping till they slept."
9587,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In night’s third part, when stars began to stoop,"
9588,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Cloud-assembler put a tempest up.
9589,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A boist’rous spirit he gave it, drave out all"
9590,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His flocks of clouds, and let such darkness fall"
9591,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That Earth and Seas, for fear, to hide were driv’n,"
9592,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For with his clouds he thrust out Night from heav’n.
9593,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At morn we drew our ships into a cave,"
9594,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In which the Nymphs that Phœbus’ cattle drave
9595,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fair dancing-rooms had, and their seats of state."
9596,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I urg’d my friends then, that, to shun their fate,"
9597,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They would observe their oath, and take the food"
9598,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our ship afforded, nor attempt the blood"
9599,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of those fair herds and flocks, because they were"
9600,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The dreadful God’s that all could see and hear.
9601,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They stood observant, and in that good mind"
9602,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Had we been gone; but so adverse the wind
9603,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stood to our passage, that we could not go."
9604,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For one whole month perpetually did blow
9605,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Impetuous Notus, not a breath’s repair"
9606,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But his and Eurus’ rul’d in all the air.
9607,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As long yet as their ruddy wine and bread
9608,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stood out amongst them, so long not a head"
9609,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all those oxen fell in any strife
9610,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amongst those students for the gut and life;
9611,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But when their victuals fail’d they fell to prey,"
9612,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Necessity compell’d them then to stray
9613,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In rape of fish and fowl; whatever came
9614,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In reach of hand or hook, the belly’s flame"
9615,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Afflicted to it. I then fell to pray’r,"
9616,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And (making to a close retreat repair,"
9617,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Free from both friends and winds) I wash’d my hands,"
9618,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all the Gods besought, that held commands"
9619,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In liberal heav’n, to yield some mean to stay"
9620,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their desp’rate hunger, and set up the way"
9621,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of our return restrain’d. The Gods, instead"
9622,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of giving what I pray’d for—pow’r of deed—
9623,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A deedless sleep did on my lids distill,"
9624,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For mean to work upon my friends their fill.
9625,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For whiles I slept, there wak’d no mean to curb"
9626,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their headstrong wants; which he that did disturb
9627,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My rule in chief at all times, and was chief"
9628,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all the rest in counsel to their grief,"
9629,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Knew well, and of my present absence took"
9630,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His fit advantage, and their iron strook"
9631,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At highest heat. For, feeling their desire"
9632,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his own entrails, to allay the fire"
9633,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That Famine blew in them, he thus gave way"
9634,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To that affection: ‘Hear what I shall say,"
9635,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though words will staunch no hunger, ev’ry death"
9636,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To us poor wretches that draw temporal breath
9637,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You know is hateful; but, all know, to die"
9638,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The death of Famine is a misery
9639,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Past all death loathsome. Let us, therefore, take"
9640,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The chief of this fair herd, and off’rings make"
9641,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all the Deathless that in broad heav’n live,"
9642,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And in particular vow, if we arrive"
9643,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In natural Ithaca, to straight erect"
9644,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A temple to the Haughty-in-aspect,"
9645,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rich and magnificent, and all within"
9646,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Deck it with relics many and divine.
9647,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If yet he stands incens’d, since we have slain"
9648,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His high-brow’d herd, and, therefore, will sustain"
9649,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Desire to wrack our ship, he is but one,"
9650,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all the other Gods that we atone
9651,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With our divine rites will their suffrage give
9652,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To our design’d return, and let us live."
9653,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If not, and all take part, I rather crave"
9654,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To serve with one sole death the yawning wave,"
9655,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Than in a desert island lie and sterve,"
9656,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And with one pin’d life many deaths observe.’
9657,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All cried ‘He counsels nobly,’ and all speed"
9658,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Made to their resolute driving; for the feed
9659,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of those coal-black, fair, broad-brow’d, sun-lov’d beeves"
9660,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Had place close by our ships. They took the lives
9661,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of sence, most eminent; about their fall"
9662,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stood round, and to the States Celestial"
9663,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Made solemn vows; but other rites their ship
9664,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Could not afford them, they did, therefore, strip"
9665,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The curl’d-head oak of fresh young leaves, to make"
9666,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Supply of service for their barley-cake.
9667,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And on the sacredly-enflam’d, for wine,"
9668,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pour’d purest water, all the parts divine"
9669,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Spitting and roasting; all the rites beside
9670,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Orderly using. Then did light divide
9671,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My low and upper lids; when, my repair"
9672,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made near my ship, I met the delicate air"
9673,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their roast exhal’d; out instantly I cried,"
9674,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said: ‘O Jove, and all ye Deified,"
9675,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ye have oppress’d me with a cruel sleep,"
9676,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,While ye conferr’d on me a loss as deep
9677,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As Death descends to. To themselves alone
9678,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My rude men left ungovern’d, they have done"
9679,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A deed so impious, I stand well assur’d,"
9680,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That you will not forgive though ye procur’d.’
9681,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then flew Lampetié with the ample robe
9682,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up to her father with the golden globe,"
9683,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ambassadress t’ inform him that my men
9684,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had slain his oxen. Heart-incensed then,"
9685,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He cried: ‘Revenge me, Father, and the rest"
9686,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Both ever-living and for ever blest!
9687,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ulysses’ impious men have drawn the blood
9688,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of those my oxen that it did me good
9689,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To look on, walking all my starry round,"
9690,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And when I trod earth all with meadows crown’d.
9691,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Without your full amends I’ll leave heav’n quite,"
9692,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Dis and the dead adorning with my light.’
9693,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Cloud-herd answer’d: ‘Son! Thou shalt be ours,"
9694,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And light those mortals in that mine of flow’rs!
9695,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My red-hot flash shall graze but on their ship,"
9696,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And eat it, burning, in the boiling deep.’"
9697,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This by Calypso I was told, and she"
9698,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Inform’d it from the verger Mercury.
9699,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Come to our ship, I chid and told by name"
9700,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Each man how impiously he was to blame.
9701,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But chiding got no peace, and beeves were slain!"
9702,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When straight the Gods forewent their following pain
9703,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With dire ostents. The hides the flesh had lost
9704,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Crept all before them. As the flesh did roast,"
9705,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It bellow’d like the ox itself alive.
9706,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And yet my soldiers did their dead beeves drive
9707,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Through all these prodigies in daily feasts.
9708,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Six days they banqueted and slew fresh beasts;
9709,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And when the sev’nth day Jove reduc’d the wind
9710,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That all the month rag’d, and so in did bind"
9711,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our ship and us, was turn’d and calm’d, and we"
9712,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Launch’d, put up masts, sails hoised, and to sea."
9713,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The island left so far that land nowhere
9714,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But only sea and sky had pow’r t’ appear,"
9715,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove fix’d a cloud above our ship, so black"
9716,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That all the sea it darken’d. Yet from wrack
9717,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She ran a good free time, till from the West"
9718,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Came Zephyr ruffling forth, and put his breast"
9719,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Out in a singing tempest, so most vast"
9720,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It burst the gables that made sure our mast.
9721,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our masts came tumbling down, our cattle down"
9722,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rush’d to the pump, and by our pilot’s crown"
9723,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The main-mast pass’d his fall, pash’d all his skull,"
9724,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all this wrack but one flaw made at full.
9725,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Off from the stern the sternsman diving fell,"
9726,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And from his sinews flew his soul to hell.
9727,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Together all this time Jove’s thunder chid,"
9728,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And through and through the ship his lightning glid,"
9729,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Till it embrac’d her round; her bulk was fill’d
9730,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With nasty sulphur, and her men were kill’d,"
9731,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tumbled to sea, like sea-mews swum about,"
9732,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And there the date of their return was out.
9733,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I toss’d from side to side still, till all-broke"
9734,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her ribs were with the storm, and she did choke"
9735,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With let-in surges; for the mast torn down
9736,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tore her up piecemeal, and for me to drown"
9737,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Left little undissolv’d. But to the mast
9738,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There was a leather thong left, which I cast"
9739,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About it and the keel, and so sat tost"
9740,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With baneful weather, till the West had lost"
9741,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His stormy tyranny. And then arose
9742,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The South, that bred me more abhorréd woes;"
9743,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For back again his blasts expell’d me quite
9744,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,On ravenous Charybdis. All that night
9745,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I totter’d up and down, till Light and I"
9746,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At Scylla’s rock encounter’d, and the nigh"
9747,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dreadful Charybdis. As I drave on these,"
9748,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I saw Charybdis supping up the seas,"
9749,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And had gone up together, if the tree"
9750,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That bore the wild figs had not rescued me;
9751,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To which I leap’d, and left my keel, and high"
9752,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Chamb’ring upon it did as close imply
9753,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My breast about it as a reremouse could;
9754,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Yet might my feet on no stub fasten hold
9755,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To ease my hands, the roots were crept so low"
9756,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beneath the earth, and so aloft did grow"
9757,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The far-spread arms that, though good height I gat,"
9758,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I could not reach them. To the main bole flat
9759,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I, therefore, still must cling; till up again"
9760,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She belch’d my mast, and after that amain"
9761,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My keel came tumbling. So at length it chanc’d
9762,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To me, as to a judge that long advanc’d"
9763,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To judge a sort of hot young fellows’ jars,"
9764,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At length time frees him from their civil wars,"
9765,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When glad he riseth and to dinner goes;
9766,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So time, at length, releas’d with joys my woes,"
9767,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And from Charybdis’ mouth appear’d my keel.
9768,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To which, my hand now loos’d and now my heel,"
9769,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I altogether with a huge noise dropp’d,"
9770,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Just in her midst fell, where the mast was propp’d,"
9771,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And there row’d off with owers of my hands.
9772,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,God and man’s Father would not from her sands
9773,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let Scylla see me, for I then had died"
9774,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That bitter death that my poor friends supplied.
9775,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nine days at sea I hover’d; the tenth night
9776,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In th’ isle Ogygia, where, about the bright"
9777,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And right renown’d Calypso, I was cast"
9778,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By pow’r of Deity; where I lived embrac’d
9779,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With love and feasts. But why should I relate
9780,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Those kind occurrents? I should iterate
9781,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,What I in part to your chaste queen and you
9782,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So late imparted. And, for me to grow"
9783,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A talker-over of my tale again,"
9784,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Were past my free contentment to sustain.”

10103,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That sways our ablest and most ancient throne.
10104,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For men, if any so beneath in pow’r"
10105,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Neglect thy high will, now, or any hour"
10106,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That moves hereafter, take revenge to thee,"
10107,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Soothe all thy will, and be thy pleasure free.”"
10108,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Why then,” said he, “thou blacker of the fumes"
10109,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That dim the sun, my licens’d pow’r resumes"
10110,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Act from thy speech; but I observe so much
10111,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And fear thy pleasure, that, I dare not touch"
10112,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At any inclination of mine own,"
10113,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Till thy consenting influence be known.
10114,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But now this curious-built Phæacian ship,"
10115,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Returning from her convoy, I will strip"
10116,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all her fleeting matter, and to stone"
10117,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Transform and fix it, just when she hath gone"
10118,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her full time home, and jets before their prease"
10119,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all her trim, amids the sable seas,"
10120,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That they may cease to convoy strangers still,"
10121,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When they shall see so like a mighty hill
10122,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their glory stick before their city’s grace,"
10123,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And my hands cast a mask before her face.”[5]
10124,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O friend,” said Jove, “it shows to me the best"
10125,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all earth’s objects, that their whole prease, drest"
10126,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all their wonder, near their town shall stand,"
10127,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And stare upon a stone, so near the land,"
10128,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So like a ship, and dam up all their lights,"
10129,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As if a mountain interpos’d their sights.”
10130,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When Neptune heard this, he for Scheria went,"
10131,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whence the Phæacians took their first descent.
10132,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which when he reach’d, and, in her swiftest pride,"
10133,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The water-treader by the city’s side
10134,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Came cutting close, close he came swiftly on,"
10135,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Took her in violent hand, and to a stone"
10136,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Turn’d all her sylvan substance; all below
10137,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Firm’d her with roots, and left her. This strange show"
10138,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When the Phæacians saw, they stupid stood,"
10139,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ask’d each other, who amids the flood"
10140,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Could fix their ship so in her full speed home,"
10141,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And quite transparent make her bulk become?
10142,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus talk’d they; but were far from knowing how
10143,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These things had issue. Which their king did show,"
10144,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said: “O friends, the ancient prophecies"
10145,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My father told to me, to all our eyes"
10146,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Are now in proof. He said, the time would come,"
10147,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When Neptune, for our safe conducting home"
10148,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All sorts of strangers, out of envy fir’d,"
10149,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would meet our fairest ship as she retir’d,"
10150,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all the goodly shape and speed we boast
10151,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Should like a mountain stand before us lost
10152,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amids the moving waters; which we see
10153,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Perform’d in full end to our prophecy.
10154,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hear then my counsel, and obey me then:"
10155,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Renounce henceforth our convoy home of men,"
10156,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whoever shall hereafter greet our town;
10157,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And to th’ offended Deity’s renown
10158,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Twelve chosen oxen let us sacred make,"
10159,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That he may pity us, and from us take"
10160,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This shady mountain.” They, in fear, obey’d,"
10161,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Slew all the beeves, and to the Godhead pray’d,"
10162,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The dukes and princes all ensphering round
10163,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sacred altar; while whose tops were crown’d,"
10164,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Divine Ulysses, on his country’s breast"
10165,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Laid bound in sleep, now rose out of his rest,"
10166,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor (being so long remov’d) the region knew.
10167,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Besides which absence yet, Minerva threw"
10168,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A cloud about him, to make strange the more"
10169,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His safe arrival, lest upon his shore"
10170,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He should make known his face, and utter all"
10171,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That might prevent th’ event that was to fall.
10172,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which she prepar’d so well, that not his wife,"
10173,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Presented to him, should perceive his life,"
10174,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No citizen, no friend, till righteous fate"
10175,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Upon the Wooer’s wrongs were consummate.
10176,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Through which cloud all things show’d now to the king
10177,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of foreign fashion; the enflow’réd spring
10178,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the trees there, the perpetual waves,"
10179,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The rocks, that did more high their foreheads raise"
10180,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his wrapt eye than naturally they did,"
10181,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all the haven, in which a man seem’d hid"
10182,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From wind and weather, when storms loudest chid."
10183,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He therefore, being risen, stood and view’d"
10184,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His country-earth; which, not perceiv’d, he rued,"
10185,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, striking with his hurl’d-down hands his thighs,"
10186,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He mourn’d, and said: “O me! Again where lies"
10187,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My desert way? To wrongful men and rude,"
10188,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And with no laws of human right endued?
10189,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or are they human, and of holy minds?"
10190,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,What fits my deed with these so many kinds
10191,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of goods late giv’n? What with myself will floods
10192,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And errors do? I would to God, these goods"
10193,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had rested with their owners, and that I"
10194,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had fall’n on kings of more regality,"
10195,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To grace out my return, that lov’d indeed,"
10196,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And would have giv’n me consorts of fit speed
10197,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To my distresses’ ending! But, as now"
10198,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All knowledge flies me where I may bestow
10199,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My labour’d purchase, here they shall not stay,"
10200,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Lest what I car’d for others make their prey.
10201,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,O Gods! I see the great Phæacians then
10202,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were not all just and understanding men,"
10203,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That land me elsewhere than their vaunts pretended,"
10204,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Assuring me my country should see ended
10205,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My miseries told them, yet now eat their vaunts."
10206,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O Jove! Great Guardian of poor suppliants,"
10207,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That others sees, and notes too, shutting in"
10208,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All in thy plagues that most presume on sin,"
10209,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Revenge me on them. Let me number now
10210,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The goods they gave, to give my mind to know"
10211,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,If they have stol’n none in their close retreat.”
10212,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The goodly caldrons then, and tripods, set"
10213,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In sev’ral ranks from out the heap, he told,"
10214,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His rich wrought garments too, and all his gold,"
10215,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And nothing lack’d; and yet this man did mourn
10216,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The but suppos’d miss of his home-return,"
10217,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And creeping to the shore with much complaint;
10218,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Minerva (like a shepherd, young, and quaint,[6]"
10219,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As king sons are, a double mantle cast"
10220,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Athwart his shoulders, his fair goers grac’d"
10221,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With fitted shoes, and in his hand a dart)"
10222,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Appear’d to him, whose sight rejoic’d his heart,"
10223,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To whom he came, and said: “O friend! Since first"
10224,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I meet your sight here, be all good the worst"
10225,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That can join our encounter. Fare you fair,"
10226,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor with adverse mind welcome my repair,"
10227,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But guard these goods of mine, and succour me."
10228,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As to a God I offer pray’rs to thee,"
10229,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And low access make to thy lovéd knee.
10230,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Say truth, that I may know, what country then,"
10231,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What common people live here, and what men?"
10232,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some famous isle is this? Or gives it vent,"
10233,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Being near the sea, to some rich continent?”"
10234,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She answer’d: “Stranger, whatsoe’er you are,"
10235,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Y’are either foolish, or come passing far,"
10236,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That know not this isle, and make that doubt trouble,"
10237,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For ’tis not so exceedingly ignoble,"
10238,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But passing many know it; and so many,"
10239,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That of all nations there abides not any,"
10240,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From where the morning rises and the sun,"
10241,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To where the even and night their courses run,"
10242,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But know this country. Rocky ’tis, and rough,"
10243,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And so for use of horse unapt enough,"
10244,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet with sad barrenness not much infested,[7]"
10245,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since clouds are here in frequent rains digested,"
10246,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And flow’ry dews. The compass is not great,"
10247,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The little yet well-fill’d with wine and wheat.
10248,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It feeds a goat and ox well, being still"
10249,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Water’d with floods, that ever over-fill"
10250,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With heav’n’s continual show’rs; and wooded so,"
10251,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It makes a spring of all the kinds that grow.
10252,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore, Stranger, the extended name"
10253,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of this dominion makes access by fame
10254,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From this extreme part of Achaia
10255,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As far as Ilion, and ’tis Ithaca.”"
10256,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This joy’d him much, that so unknown a land"
10257,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Turn’d to his country. Yet so wise a hand
10258,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He carried, ev’n of this joy, flown so high,"
10259,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That other end he put to his reply
10260,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Than straight to show that joy, and lay abroad"
10261,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His life to strangers. Therefore he bestow’d
10262,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A veil on truth; for evermore did wind
10263,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About his bosom a most crafty mind,"
10264,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which thus his words show’d: “I have far at sea,"
10265,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In spacious Crete, heard speak of Ithaca,"
10266,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of which myself, it seems, now reach the shore,"
10267,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With these my fortunes; whose whole value more
10268,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I left in Crete amongst my children there,"
10269,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From whence I fly for being the slaughterer
10270,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of royal Idomen’s most-lovéd son,"
10271,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Swift-foot Orsilochus, that could out-run"
10272,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Profess’d men for the race. Yet him I slew,"
10273,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Because he would deprive me of my due
10274,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In Trojan prise; for which I suffer’d so
10275,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(The rude waves piercing) the redoubled woe
10276,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of mind and body in the wars of men.
10277,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor did I gratify his father then
10278,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With any service, but, as well as he"
10279,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sway’d in command of other soldiery,"
10280,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So, with a friend withdrawn, we waylaid him,"
10281,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When gloomy night the cope of heav’n did dim,"
10282,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And no man knew; but, we lodg’d close, he came,"
10283,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And I put out to him his vital flame.
10284,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose slaughter having author’d with my sword,"
10285,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I instant flight made, and straight fell aboard"
10286,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A ship of the renown’d Phœnician state;
10287,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When pray’r, and pay at a sufficient rate,"
10288,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Obtain’d my pass of men in her command;
10289,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whom I enjoin’d to set me on the land
10290,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Pylos, or of Elis the divine,"
10291,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Where the Epeïans in great empire shine.
10292,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But force of weather check’d that course to them,"
10293,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Though (loth to fail me) to their most extreme
10294,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They spent their willing pow’rs. But, forc’d from thence,"
10295,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We err’d, and put in here, with much expence"
10296,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of care and labour; and in dead of night,"
10297,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When no man there serv’d any appetite
10298,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So much as with the memory of food,"
10299,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Though our estates exceeding needy stood.
10300,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, going ashore, we lay; when gentle sleep"
10301,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My weary pow’rs invaded, and from ship"
10302,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They fetching these my riches, with just hand"
10303,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About me laid them, while upon the sand"
10304,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Sleep bound my senses; and for Sidon they
10305,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Put off from hence) made sail, while here I lay,"
10306,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Left sad alone.” The Goddess laugh’d, and took"
10307,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His hand in hers, and with another look"
10308,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Assuming then the likeness of a dame,"
10309,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lovely and goodly, expert in the frame"
10310,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of virtuous housewif’ries) she answer’d thus:
10311,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“He should be passing-sly, and covetous"
10312,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of stealth, in men’s deceits, that coted thee[8]"
10313,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In any craft, though any God should be"
10314,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ambitious to exceed in subtilty.
10315,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thou still-wit-varying wretch! Insatiate[9]
10316,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In over-reaches! Not secure thy state
10317,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Without these wiles, though on thy native shore"
10318,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou sett’st safe footing, but upon thy store"
10319,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of false words still spend, that ev’n from thy birth"
10320,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Have been thy best friends? Come, our either worth"
10321,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is known to either. Thou of men art far,"
10322,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For words and counsels, the most singular,"
10323,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But I above the Gods in both may boast
10324,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My still-tried faculties. Yet thou hast lost
10325,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The knowledge ev’n of me, the Seed of Jove,"
10326,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pallas Athenia, that have still out-strove"
10327,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all thy labours their extremes, and stood"
10328,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy sure guard ever, making all thy good"
10329,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Known to the good Phæacians, and receiv’d."
10330,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And now again I greet thee, to see weav’d"
10331,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fresh counsels for thee, and will take on me"
10332,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The close reserving of these goods for thee,"
10333,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which the renown’d Phæacian states bestow’d
10334,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At thy deduction homewards, only mov’d"
10335,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With my both spirit and counsel. All which grace
10336,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I now will amplify, and tell what case"
10337,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy household stands in, utt’ring all those pains"
10338,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That of mere need yet still must wrack thy veins.
10339,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Do thou then freely bear, nor one word give"
10340,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To man nor dame to show thou yet dost live,"
10341,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But silent suffer over all again
10342,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy sorrows past, and bear the wrongs of men.”"
10343,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Goddess,” said he, “unjust men, and unwise,"
10344,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That author injuries and vanities,"
10345,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By vanities and wrongs should rather be
10346,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bound to this ill-abearing destiny,"
10347,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Than just and wise men. What delight hath heav’n,"
10348,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That lives unhurt itself, to suffer giv’n"
10349,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Up to all domage those poor few that strive
10350,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To imitate it, and like the Deities live?"
10351,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But where you wonder that I know you not
10352,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Through all your changes, that skill is not got"
10353,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By sleight or art, since thy most hard-hit face"
10354,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Is still distinguish’d by thy free-giv’n grace;
10355,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore, truly to acknowledge thee"
10356,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In thy encounters, is a mastery"
10357,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In men most-knowing; for to all men thou
10358,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Tak’st sev’ral likeness. All men think they know
10359,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thee in their wits; but, since thy seeming view"
10360,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Appears to all, and yet thy truth to few,"
10361,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Through all thy changes to discern thee right
10362,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Asks chief love to thee, and inspiréd light."
10363,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But this I surely know, that, some years past,"
10364,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I have been often with thy presence grac’d,"
10365,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All time the sons of Greece wag’d war at Troy;
10366,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But when Fate’s full hour let our swords enjoy
10367,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our vows in sack of Priam’s lofty town,"
10368,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our ships all boarded, and when God had blown"
10369,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our fleet in sunder, I could never see"
10370,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Seed of Jove, nor once distinguish thee"
10371,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Boarding my ship, to take one woe from me."
10372,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But only in my proper spirit involv’d,"
10373,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Err’d here and there, quite slain, till heav’n dissolv’d"
10374,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Me, and my ill; which chanc’d not, till thy grace"
10375,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By open speech confirm’d me, in a place"
10376,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fruitful of people, where, in person, thou"
10377,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Didst give me guide, and all their city show;"
10378,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And that was the renown’d Phæacian earth.
10379,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now then, ev’n by the Author of thy birth,"
10380,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Vouchsafe my doubt the truth (for far it flies
10381,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My thoughts that thus should fall into mine eyes
10382,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Conspicuous Ithaca, but fear I touch"
10383,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At some far shore, and that thy wit is such"
10384,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thou dost delude me) is it sure the same
10385,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Most honour’d earth that bears my country’s name?”
10386,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“I see,” said she, “thou wilt be ever thus"
10387,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In ev’ry worldly good incredulous,"
10388,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And therefore have no more the pow’r to see
10389,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Frail life more plagued with infelicity
10390,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In one so eloquent, ingenious, wise."
10391,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Another man, that so long miseries"
10392,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had kept from his lov’d home, and thus return’d"
10393,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To see his house, wife, children, would have burn’d"
10394,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In headlong lust to visit. Yet t’ inquire
10395,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What states they hold, affects not thy desire,"
10396,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Till thou hast tried if in thy wife there be
10397,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A sorrow wasting days and nights for thee
10398,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In loving tears, that then the sight may prove"
10399,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A full reward for either’s mutual love.
10400,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But I would never credit in you both
10401,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Least cause of sorrow, but well knew the troth"
10402,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of this thine own return, though all thy friends,"
10403,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I knew as well, should make returnless ends;"
10404,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Yet would not cross mine uncle Neptune so
10405,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To stand their safeguard, since so high did go"
10406,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His wrath for thy extinction of the eye
10407,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his lov’d son. Come then, I’ll show thee why"
10408,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I call this isle thy Ithaca, to ground"
10409,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy credit on my words: This haven is own’d
10410,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By th’ agéd sea-god Phorcys, in whose brow"
10411,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This is the olive with the ample bough,"
10412,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And here, close by, the pleasant-shaded cave"
10413,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That to the Fount-Nymphs th’ Ithacensians gave,"
10414,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As sacred to their pleasures. Here doth run
10415,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The large and cover’d den, where thou hast done"
10416,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hundreds of off’rings to the Naiades,"
10417,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Here Mount Neritus shakes his curléd tress
10418,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of shady woods.” This said, she clear’d the cloud"
10419,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That first deceiv’d his eyes; and all things show’d
10420,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His country to him. Glad he stood with sight
10421,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his lov’d soil, and kiss’d it with delight;"
10422,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And instantly to all the Nymphs he paid
10423,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(With hands held up to heav’n) these vows, and said:"
10424,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Ye Nymphs the Naiades, great Seed of Jove,"
10425,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I had conceit that never more should move
10426,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your sight in these spheres of my erring eyes,"
10427,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore, in the fuller sacrifice"
10428,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of my heart’s gratitude, rejoice, till more"
10429,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I pay your names in off’rings as before;
10430,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which here I vow, if Jove’s benign descent,"
10431,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The mighty Pillager, with life convent"
10432,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My person home, and to my sav’d decease"
10433,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of my lov’d son’s sight add the sweet increase.”
10434,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Be confident,” said Pallas, “nor oppress"
10435,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy spirits with care of these performances,"
10436,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But these thy fortunes let us straight repose

10438,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Reserve their value; and we then may see
10439,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,How best to order other acts to thee.”
10440,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus enter’d she the light-excluding cave,"
10441,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And through it sought some inmost nook to save
10442,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The gold, the great brass, and robes richly-wrought,"
10443,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Giv’n to Ulysses. All which in he brought,"
10444,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Laid down in heap; and she impos’d a stone
10445,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Close to the cavern’s mouth. Then sat they on
10446,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sacred olive’s root, consulting how"
10447,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To act th’ insulting Wooers’ overthrow;
10448,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When Pallas said: “Examine now the means
10449,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That best may lay hands on the impudence
10450,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of those proud Wooers, that have now three years"
10451,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy roof’s rule sway’d, and been bold offerers"
10452,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of suit and gifts to thy renownéd wife,"
10453,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Who for thy absence all her desolate life
10454,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Dissolves in tears till thy desir’d return;
10455,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet all her Wooers, while she thus doth mourn,"
10456,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She holds in hope, and ev’ry one affords"
10457,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(In fore-sent message) promise; but her words
10458,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Bear other utt’rance than her heart approves.”
10459,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O Gods,” said Ithacus, “it now behoves"
10460,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My fate to end me in the ill decease
10461,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That Agamemnon underwent, unless"

10466,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Breathe in my bosom, as when th’ Ilion tow’rs"
10467,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,We tore in cinders. O if equal pow’rs
10468,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou wouldst enflame amidst my nerves as then,"
10469,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I could encounter with three hundred men,"
10470,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy only self, great Goddess, had to friend,"
10471,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In those brave ardors thou wert wont t’ extend!”
10472,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“I will be strongly with thee,” answer’d she,"
10473,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Nor must thou fail, but do thy part with me."
10474,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When both whose pow’rs combine, I hope the bloods"
10475,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And brains of some of these that waste thy goods
10476,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Shall strew thy goodly pavements. Join we then:
10477,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I first will render thee unknown to men,"
10478,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And on thy solid lineaments make dry
10479,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy now smooth skin; thy bright-brown curls imply
10480,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In hoary mattings; thy broad shoulders clothe
10481,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In such a cloak as ev’ry eye shall lothe;
10482,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy bright eyes blear and wrinkle; and so change
10483,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy form at all parts, that thou shalt be strange"
10484,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all the Wooers, thy young son, and wife."
10485,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But to thy herdsman first present thy life,"
10486,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That guards thy swine, and wisheth well to thee,"
10487,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That loves thy son and wife Penelopé.
10488,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy search shall find him set aside his herd,"
10489,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That are with taste-delighting acorns rear’d,"
10490,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And drink the dark-deep water of the spring,"
10491,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bright Arethusa, the most nourishing"
10492,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Raiser of herds. There stay, and, taking seat"
10493,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Aside thy herdsman, of the whole state treat"
10494,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of home-occurrents, while I make access"
10495,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To fair-dame-breeding Sparta for regress
10496,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of lov’d Telemachus, who went in quest"
10497,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of thy lov’d fame, and liv’d the welcome guest"
10498,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of Menelaus.” The much-knower said:
10499,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Why wouldst not thou, in whose grave breast is bred"
10500,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The art to order all acts, tell in this"
10501,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His error to him? Let those years of his
10502,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amids the rude seas wander, and sustain"
10503,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The woes there raging, while unworthy men"
10504,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Devour his fortunes?” “Let not care extend
10505,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy heart for him,” said she, “myself did send"
10506,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His person in thy search; to set his worth,"
10507,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By good fame blown, to such a distance forth."
10508,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor suffers he in any least degree
10509,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The grief you fear, but all variety"
10510,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That Plenty can yield in her quiet’st fare,"
10511,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In Menelaus’ court, doth sit and share."
10512,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In whose return from home, the Wooers yet"
10513,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lay bloody ambush, and a ship have set"
10514,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To sea, to intercept his life before"
10515,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He touch again his birth’s attempted shore.
10516,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All which, my thoughts say, they shall never do,"
10517,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But rather, that the earth shall overgo"
10518,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some one at least of these love-making men,"
10519,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By which thy goods so much impair sustain.”
10520,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus using certain secret words to him,"
10521,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,She touch’d him with her rod; and ev’ry limb
10522,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was hid all-over with a wither’d skin;
10523,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His bright eyes blear’d; his brow-curls white and thin;
10524,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all things did an agéd man present.
10525,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then, for his own weeds, shirt and coat, all-rent,"
10526,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tann’d, and all-sootiéd with noisome smoke,"
10527,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She put him on; and, over all, a cloke"
10528,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made of a stag’s huge hide, of which was worn"
10529,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The hair quite off; a scrip, all-patch’d and torn,"
10530,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hung by a cord, oft broke and knit again;"
10531,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And with a staff did his old limbs sustain.
10532,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus having both consulted of th’ event,"
10533,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They parted both; and forth to Sparta went
10534,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The gray-eyed Goddess, to see all things done"

10766,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of queen, or lov’d son, any credit get."
10767,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These travellers, for clothes, or for a meal,"
10768,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At all adventures, any lie will tell."
10769,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor do they trade for truth. Not any man
10770,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That saw the people Ithacensian,"
10771,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all their sort, and had the queen’s supplies,"
10772,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Did ever tell her any news, but lies."
10773,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She graciously receives them yet, inquires"
10774,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all she can, and all in tears expires."
10775,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It is th’ accustom’d law, that women keep,"
10776,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their husbands elsewhere dead, at home to weep."
10777,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But do thou quickly, father, forge a tale,"
10778,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some coat, or cloak, to keep thee warm withal,"
10779,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Perhaps some one may yield thee; but for him,"
10780,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Vultures and dogs have torn from ev’ry limb
10781,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His porous skin, and forth his soul is fled,"
10782,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His corse at sea to fishes forfeited,"
10783,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or on the shore lies hid in heaps of sand,"
10784,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And there hath he his ebb, his native strand"
10785,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With friends’ tears flowing. But to me past all
10786,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were tears created, for I never shall"
10787,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Find so humane a royal master more,"
10788,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whatever sea I seek, whatever shore."
10789,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nay, to my father, or my mother’s love"
10790,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Should I return, by whom I breathe and move,"
10791,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Could I so much joy offer; nor these eyes
10792,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Though my desires sustain extremities
10793,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For their sad absence) would so fain be blest
10794,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With sight of their lives, in my native nest,"
10795,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As with Ulysses dead; in whose last rest,"
10796,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O friend, my soul shall love him. He’s not here"
10797,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor do I name him like a flatterer,"
10798,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But as one thankful for his love and care
10799,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To me a poor man; in the rich so rare.
10800,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And be he past all shores where sun can shine,"
10801,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I will invoke him as a soul divine.”
10802,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O friend,” said he, “to say, and to believe,"
10803,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He cannot live, doth too much licence give"
10804,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To incredulity; for, not to speak"
10805,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At needy randon, but my breath to break"
10806,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In sacred oath, Ulysses shall return."
10807,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And when his sight recomforts those that mourn
10808,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his own roofs, then give me cloak, and coat,"
10809,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And garments worthy of a man of note.
10810,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before which, though need urg’d me never so,"
10811,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I’ll not receive a thread, but naked go."
10812,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No less I hate him than the gates of hell,"
10813,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That poorness can force an untruth to tell.
10814,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let Jove then (Heav’n’s chief God) just witness bear,"
10815,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And this thy hospitable table here,"
10816,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Together with unblam’d Ulysses’ house,"
10817,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In which I find receipt so gracious,"
10818,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,What I affirm’d of him shall all be true.
10819,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This instant year thine eyes ev’n here shall view
10820,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy lord Ulysses. Nay, ere this month’s end,"
10821,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Return’d full-home, he shall revenge extend"
10822,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To ev’ry one, whose ever deed hath done"
10823,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Wrong to his wife and his illustrious son.”
10824,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O father,” he replied, “I’ll neither give"
10825,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy news reward, nor doth Ulysses live."
10826,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But come, enough of this, let’s drink and eat,"
10827,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And never more his memory repeat.
10828,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It grieves my heart to be remember’d thus
10829,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By anyone of one so glorious.
10830,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But stand your oath in your assertion strong,"
10831,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And let Ulysses come, for whom I long,"
10832,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For whom his wife, for whom his agéd sire,"
10833,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For whom his son consumes his god-like fire,"
10834,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose chance I now must mourn, and ever shall."
10835,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whom when the Gods had brought to be as tall
10836,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As any upright plant, and I had said,"
10837,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He would amongst a court of men have sway’d
10838,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In counsels, and for form have been admir’d"
10839,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n with his father, some God misinspir’d,"
10840,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or man took from him his own equal mind,"
10841,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And pass’d him for the Pylian shore to find
10842,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His long-lost father. In return from whence,"
10843,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Wooers’ pride way-lays his innocence,"
10844,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That of divine Arcesius all the race
10845,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"May fade to Ithaca, and not the grace"
10846,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of any name left to it. But leave we
10847,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His state, however, if surpris’d he be,"
10848,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or if he scape. And may Saturnius’ hand
10849,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Protect him safely to his native land.
10850,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Do thou then, father, show your griefs, and cause"
10851,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of your arrival here; nor break the laws
10852,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That truth prescribes you, but relate your name,"
10853,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And of what race you are, your father’s fame,"
10854,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And native city’s; ship and men unfold,"
10855,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That to this isle convey’d you, since I hold"
10856,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your here arrival was not all by shore,"
10857,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor that your feet your agéd person bore.”
10858,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He answer’d him: “I’ll tell all strictly true,"
10859,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If time, and food, and wine enough, accrue"
10860,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Within your roof to us, that freely we"
10861,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,May sit and banquet. Let your business be
10862,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Discharg’d by others; for, when all is done,"
10863,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I cannot easily, while the year doth run"
10864,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His circle round, run over all the woes,"
10865,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beneath which, by the course the Gods dispose,"
10866,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My sad age labours. First, I’ll tell you then,"
10867,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From ample Crete I fetch my native strain;
10868,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My father wealthy, whose house many a life"
10869,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Brought forth and bred besides by his true wife,"
10870,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But me a bond-maid bore, his concubine."
10871,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Yet tender’d was I as his lawful line
10872,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By him of whose race I my life profess.
10873,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Castor his name, surnam’d Hylacides."
10874,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A man, in fore-times, by the Cretan state,"
10875,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For goods, good children, and his fortunate"
10876,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Success in all acts, of no mean esteem."
10877,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But death-conferring Fates have banish’d him
10878,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Pluto’s kingdom. After whom, his sons"
10879,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By lots divided his possessions,"
10880,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And gave me passing little; yet bestow’d
10881,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A house on me, to which my virtues woo’d"
10882,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A wife from rich men’s roofs; nor was borne low,"
10883,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor last in fight, though all nerves fail me now."
10884,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But I suppose, that you, by thus much seen,"
10885,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Know by the stubble what the corn hath been.
10886,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For, past all doubt, affliction past all mean"
10887,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hath brought my age on; but, in seasons past,"
10888,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both Mars and Pallas have with boldness grac’d,"
10889,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And fortitude, my fortunes, when I chus’d"
10890,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Choice men for ambush, prest to have produc’d"
10891,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ill to mine enemies; my too vent’rous spirit
10892,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Set never death before mine eyes, for merit,"
10893,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, far the first advanc’d still, still I strook"
10894,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Dead with my lance whoever overtook
10895,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My speed of foot. Such was I then for war.
10896,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But rustic actions ever fled me far,"
10897,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And household thrift, which breeds a famous race."
10898,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In oar-driv’n ships did I my pleasures place,"
10899,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In battles, light darts, arrows. Sad things all,"
10900,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And into others’ thoughts with horror fall.
10901,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But what God put into my mind, to me"
10902,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I still esteem’d as my felicity.
10903,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As men of sev’ral metals are address’d,"
10904,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So sev’ral forms are in their souls impress’d.
10905,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before the sons of Greece set foot in Troy,"
10906,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nine times, in chief, I did command enjoy"
10907,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of men and ships against our foreign foe,"
10908,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all I fitly wish’d succeeded so.
10909,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet, after this, I much exploit achiev’d,"
10910,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When straight my house in all possessions thriv’d.
10911,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet, after that, I great and rev’rend grew"
10912,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the Cretans, till the Thund’rer drew"
10913,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our forces out in his foe-Troy decrees;
10914,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A hateful service that dissolv’d the knees
10915,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of many a soldier. And to this was I,"
10916,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And famous Idomen, enjoin’d t’ apply"
10917,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our ships and pow’rs, Nor was there to be heard"
10918,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One reason for denial, so preferr’d"
10919,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was the unreasonable people’s rumour.
10920,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nine years we therefore fed the martial humour,"
10921,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And in the tenth, de-peopling Priam’s town,"
10922,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,We sail’d for home. But God had quickly blown
10923,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our fleet in pieces; and to wretched me
10924,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The counsellor Jove did much mishap decree,"
10925,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For, only one month, I had leave t’ enjoy"
10926,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My wife and children, and my goods t’ employ."
10927,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, after this, my mind for Ægypt stood,"
10928,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When nine fair ships I rigg’d forth for the flood,"
10929,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mann’d them with noble soldiers, all things fit"
10930,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For such a voyage soon were won to it.
10931,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet six days after stay’d my friends in feast,"
10932,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,While I in banquets to the Gods addrest
10933,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Much sacred matter for their sacrifice.
10934,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The seventh, we boarded; and the Northern skies"
10935,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lent us a frank and passing prosp’rous gale,"
10936,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,‘Fore which we bore us free and easy sail
10937,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As we had back’d a full and frolic tide;
10938,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor felt one ship misfortune for her pride,"
10939,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But safe we sat, our sailors and the wind"
10940,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Consenting in our convoy. When heav’n shin’d
10941,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In sacred radiance of the fifth fair day,"
10942,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To sweetly-water’d Egypt reach’d our way,"
10943,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And there we anchor’d; where I charg’d my men
10944,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To stay aboard, and watch. Dismissing then"
10945,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some scouts to get the hill-tops, and discover,"
10946,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They (to their own intemperance giv’n over).
10947,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Straight fell to forage the rich fields, and thence"
10948,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Enforce both wives and infants, with th’ expence"
10949,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of both their bloods. When straight the rumour flew
10950,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up to the city. Which heard, up they drew"
10951,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By day’s First break, and all the field was fill’d"
10952,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With foot and horse, whose arms did all things gild."
10953,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And then the lightning-loving Deity cast
10954,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A foul flight on my soldiers; nor stood fast
10955,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One man of all. About whom mischief stood,"
10956,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And with his stern steel drew in streams the blood
10957,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The greater part fed in their dissolute veins;
10958,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The rest were sav’d, and made enthralléd swains"
10959,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To all the basest usages there bred.
10960,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then, ev’n Jove himself supplied my head"
10961,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With saving counsel; though I wish’d to die,"
10962,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And there in Egypt with their slaughters lie,"
10963,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So much grief seiz’d me, but Jove made me yield,"
10964,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dishelm my head, take from my neck my shield,"
10965,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hurl from my hand my lance, and to the troop"
10966,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of horse the king led instantly made up,"
10967,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Embrace, and kiss his knees; whom pity won"
10968,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To give me safety, and (to make me shun"
10969,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The people’s outrage, that made in amain,"
10970,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All jointly fir’d with thirst to see me slain)
10971,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He took me to his chariot, weeping, home,"
10972,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Himself with fear of Jove’s wrath overcome,"
10973,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who yielding souls receives, and takes most ill"
10974,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All such as well may save yet love to kill.
10975,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Seven years I sojourn’d here, and treasure gat"
10976,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In good abundance of th’ Ægyptian state,"
10977,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For all would give; but when th’ eighth year began,"
10978,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A knowing fellow (that would gnaw a man[3]
10979,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like to a vermin, with his hellish brain,"
10980,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And many an honest soul ev’n quick had slain,"
10981,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose name was Phœnix) close accosted me,"
10982,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And with insinuations, such as he"
10983,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Practis’d on others, my consent he gain’d"
10984,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To go into Phœnicia, where remain’d"
10985,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His house, and living. And with him I liv’d"
10986,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A cómplete year; but when were all arriv’d
10987,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The months and days, and that the year again"
10988,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was turning round, and ev’ry season’s reign"
10989,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Renew’d upon us, we for Libya went,"
10990,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When, still inventing crafts to circumvent,"
10991,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He made pretext, that I should only go"
10992,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And help convey his freight; but thought not so,"
10993,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For his intent was to have sold me there,"
10994,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And made good gain for finding me a year.
10995,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet him I follow’d, though suspecting this,"
10996,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For, being aboard his ship, I must be his"
10997,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of strong necessity. She ran the flood
10998,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Driven with a northern gale, right free, and good)"
10999,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amids the full stream, full on Crete. But then"
11000,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove plotted death to him and all his men,"
11001,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For (put off quite from Crete, and so far gone"
11002,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That shore was lost, and we set eye on none,"
11003,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But all show’d heav’n and sea) above our keel
11004,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove pointed right a cloud as black as hell,"
11005,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beneath which all the sea hid, and from whence"
11006,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove thunder’d as his hand would never thence,"
11007,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And thick into our ship he threw his flash;[4]
11008,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That ’gainst a rock, or flat, her keel did dash"
11009,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With headlong rapture. Of the sulphur all
11010,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her bulk did savour; and her men let fall
11011,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amids the surges, on which all lay tost,"
11012,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like sea-gulls, round about her sides, and lost."
11013,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And so God took all home-return from them.
11014,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But Jove himself, though plung’d in that extreme,"
11015,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Recover’d me by thrusting on my hand
11016,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The ship’s long mast. And, that my life might stand"
11017,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A little more up, I embrac’d it round;"
11018,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And on the rude winds, that did ruins sound,"
11019,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nine days we hover’d. In the tenth black night
11020,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A huge sea cast me on Thesprotia’s height,"
11021,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where the heroë Phidon, that was chief"
11022,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the Thesprots, gave my wrack relief,"
11023,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Without the price of that redemptión[5]
11024,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That Phœnix fish’d for. Where the king’s lov’d son
11025,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Came to me, took me by the hand, and led"
11026,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Into his court my poor life, surfeited"
11027,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With cold and labour; and because my wrack
11028,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Chanc’d on his father’s shore, he let not lack"
11029,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My plight or coat, or cloak, or anything"
11030,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Might cherish heat in me. And here the king
11031,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Said, he receiv’d Ulysses as his guest,"
11032,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Observ’d him friend-like, and his course addrest"
11033,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Home to his country, showing there to me"
11034,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses’ goods, a very treasury"
11035,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of brass, and gold, and steel of curious frame."
11036,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And to the tenth succession of his name
11037,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He laid up wealth enough, to serve beside"
11038,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In that king’s house, so hugely amplified"
11039,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His treasure was. But from his court the king
11040,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Affirm’d him shipp’d for the Dodonean spring,"
11041,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To hear, from out the high-hair’d oak of Jove,"
11042,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Counsel from him for means to his remove
11043,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his lov’d country, whence so many a year"
11044,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He had been absent; if he should appear
11045,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Disguis’d, or manifest; and further swore"
11046,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his mid court, at sacrifice, before"
11047,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These very eyes, that he had ready there"
11048,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both ship and soldiers, to attend and bear"
11049,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Him to his country. But, before, it chanc’d"
11050,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That a Thesprotian ship was to be launch’d
11051,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For the much-corn-renown’d Dulichian land,"
11052,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In which the king gave to his men command
11053,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To take, and bring me under tender hand"
11054,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To king Acastus. But, in ill design"
11055,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of my poor life, did their desires combine,"
11056,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So far forth, as might ever keep me under"
11057,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In fortune’s hands, and tear my state in sunder."
11058,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And when the water-treader far away
11059,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had left the land, then plotted they the day"
11060,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of my long servitude, and took from me"
11061,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both coat and cloak, and all things that might be"
11062,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Grace in my habit, and in place put on"
11063,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These tatter’d rags, which now you see upon"
11064,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My wretched bosom. When heav’n’s light took sea,[6]"
11065,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They fetch’d the field-works of fair Ithaca,"
11066,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And in the arm’d ship, with a well-wreath’d cord,"
11067,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They straitly bound me, and did all disboard"
11068,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To shore to supper, in contentious rout."
11069,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Yet straight the Gods themselves took from about
11070,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My pressed limbs the bands, with equal ease,"
11071,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And I, my head in rags wrapp’d, took the seas,"
11072,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Descending by the smooth stern, using then"
11073,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My hands for oars, and made from these bad men"
11074,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Long way in little time. At last, I fetch’d"
11075,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A goodly grove of oaks, whose shore I reach’d,"
11076,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And cast me prostrate on it. When they knew
11077,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My thus-made ‘scape, about the shores they flew,"
11078,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, soon not finding, held it not their best"
11079,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To seek me further, but return’d to rest"
11080,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Aboard their vessel. Me the Gods lodg’d close,"
11081,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Conducting me into the safe repose
11082,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A good man’s stable yielded. And thus Fate
11083,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This poor hour added to my living date.”
11084,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O wretch of guests,” said he, “thy tale hath stirr’d"
11085,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My mind to much ruth, both how thou hast err’d,"
11086,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And suffer’d, hearing in such good parts shown."
11087,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, what thy chang’d relation would make known"
11088,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About Ulysses, I hold neither true,"
11089,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor will believe. And what need’st thou pursue
11090,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A lie so rashly, since he sure is so"
11091,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As I conceive, for which my skill shall go?"
11092,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The safe return my king lacks cannot be,"
11093,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He is so envied of each Deity,"
11094,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So clear, so cruelly. For not in Troy"
11095,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They gave him end, nor let his corpse enjoy"
11096,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The hands of friends (which well they might have done,"
11097,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He manag’d arms to such perfection,"

11157,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My men will make home, when our sweet repast"

11160,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His swine and swine-herds came, who in their cotes"
11161,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Inclos’d their herds for sleep, which mighty throats"
11162,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Laid out in ent’ring. Then the God-like swain
11163,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His men enjoin’d thus: “Bring me to be slain
11164,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A chief swine female, for my stranger guest,"
11165,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When altogether we will take our feast,"

11169,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since others eat our labours, and take none.”"
11170,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, his sharp steel hew’d down wood, and they"
11171,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A passing fat swine hal’d out of the sty,"
11172,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of five years old, which to the fire they put."
11173,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When first Eumæus from the front did cut
11174,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sacred hair, and cast it in the fire,"
11175,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then pray’d to heav’n; for still before desire
11176,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was serv’d with food, in their so rude abodes,"
11177,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not the poor swine-herd would forget the Gods,"
11178,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Good souls they bore, how bad soever were"
11179,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The habits that their bodies’ parts did bear.
11180,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When all the deathless Deities besought,"
11181,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That wise Ulysses might be safely brought
11182,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Home to his house; then with a log of oak
11183,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Left lying by, high lifting it, a stroke"
11184,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He gave so deadly it made life expire.
11185,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then cut the rest her throat, and all in fire"
11186,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They hid and sing’d her, cut her up; and then,"
11187,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The master took the office from the men,"
11188,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Who on the altar did the parts impose
11189,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That serv’d for sacrifice; beginning close
11190,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About the belly, thorough which he went."
11191,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And (all the chief fat gath’ring) gave it vent
11192,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Part dredg’d with flour) into the sacred flame;
11193,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then cut they up the joints, and roasted them,"
11194,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Drew all from spit, and serv’d in dishes all."
11195,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then rose Eumæus (who was general
11196,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In skill to guide each act his fit event)
11197,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, all in seven parts cut, the first part went"
11198,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To service of the Nymphs and Mercury,"
11199,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To whose names he did rites of piety
11200,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In vows particular; and all the rest
11201,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He shar’d to ev’ry one, but his lov’d guest"
11202,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He grac’d with all the chine, and of that king,"
11203,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To have his heart cheer’d, set up ev’ry string."
11204,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which he observing said: “I would to Jove,"
11205,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eumæus, thou liv’dst in his worthy love"
11206,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As great as mine, that giv’st to such a guest"
11207,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As my poor self of all thy goods the best.”
11208,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eumæus answer’d: “Eat, unhappy wretch,"
11209,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And to what here is at thy pleasure reach.
11210,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This I have, this thou want’st; thus God will give,"
11211,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus take away, in us, and all that live."
11212,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his will’s equal centre all things fall,"
11213,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His mind he must have, for he can do all.”"
11214,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus having eat, and to his wine descended,"
11215,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before he serv’d his own thirst, he commended"
11216,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The first use of it in fit sacrifice
11217,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(As of his meat) to all the Deities,"
11218,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And to the city-racer’s hand applied
11219,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The second cup, whose place was next his side."
11220,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mesauliús did distribute the meat,"
11221,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(To which charge was Eumæus solely set,"
11222,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In absence of Ulysses, by the queen"
11223,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And old Laertes) and this man had been
11224,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bought by Eumæus, with his faculties,"
11225,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Employ’d then in the Taphian merchandise.
11226,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But now, to food appos’d, and order’d thus,"
11227,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All fell. Desire suffic’d, Mesauliús"
11228,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Did take away. For bed then next they were,"
11229,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All thoroughly satisfied with cómplete cheer.
11230,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The night then came, ill, and no taper shin’d;"
11231,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Jove rain’d her whole date; th’ ever-wat’ry wind
11232,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Zephyr blew loud; and Laertiades
11233,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Approving kind Eumæus’ carefulness
11234,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For his whole good) made far about assay,"
11235,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To get some cast-off cassock (lest he lay
11236,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That rough night cold) of him, or anyone"
11237,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of those his servants; when he thus begun:
11238,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Hear me, Eumæus, and my other friends,"
11239,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I’ll use a speech that to my glory tends,"
11240,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since I have drunk wine past my usual guise.
11241,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"_Strong wine commands the fool and moves the wise,_"
11242,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Moves and impels him too to sing and dance,"
11243,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And break in pleasant laughters, and, perchance,"
11244,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Prefer a speech too that were better in.
11245,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But when my spirits once to speak begin,"
11246,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I shall not then dissemble. Would to heav’n,"
11247,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I were as young, and had my forces driv’n"
11248,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As close together, as when once our pow’rs"
11249,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,We led to ambush under th’ Ilion tow’rs!
11250,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Where Ithacus and Menelaus were
11251,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The two commanders, when it pleas’d them there"
11252,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To take myself for third, when to the town"
11253,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And lofty walls we led, we couch’d close down,"
11254,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All arm’d, amids the osiers and the reeds,"
11255,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which oftentimes th’ o’er-flowing river feeds.
11256,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The cold night came, and th’ icy northern gale"
11257,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Blew bleak upon us, after which did fall"
11258,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A snow so cold, it cut as in it beat"
11259,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A frozen water, which was all concrete"
11260,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About our shields like crystal. All made feign
11261,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Above our arms to clothe, and clothe again."
11262,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And so we made good shift, our shields beside"
11263,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Clapp’d close upon our clothes, to rest and hide"
11264,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From all discovery. But I, poor fool,"
11265,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Left my weeds with my men, because so cool"
11266,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I thought it could not prove; which thought my pride
11267,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A little strengthen’d, being loth to hide"
11268,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A goodly glitt’ring garment I had on;
11269,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And so I follow’d with my shield alone,"
11270,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And that brave weed. But when the night near ended
11271,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her course on earth, and that the stars descended,"
11272,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I jogg’d Ulysses, who lay passing near,"
11273,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And spake to him, that had a nimble ear,"
11274,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Assuring him, that long I could not lie"
11275,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the living, for the fervency"
11276,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of that sharp night would kill me, since as then"
11277,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My evil angel made me with my men
11278,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Leave all weeds but a fine one. But I know
11279,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,’Tis vain to talk; here wants all remedy now.
11280,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he bore that understanding part"
11281,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In his prompt spirit that still show’d his art
11282,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In fight and counsel, saying (in a word,"
11283,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And that low whisper’d) peace, lest you afford"
11284,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some Greek note of your softness. No word more,"
11285,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But made as if his stern austerity bore
11286,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My plight no pity; yet, as still he lay"
11287,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His head reposing on his hand, gave way"
11288,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To this invention: ‘Hear me friends, a dream"
11289,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(That was of some celestial light a beam)
11290,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stood in my sleep before me, prompting me"
11291,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With this fit notice: ‘We are far,’ said he,"
11292,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘From out our fleet. Let one go then, and try"
11293,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,If Agamemnon will afford supply
11294,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To what we now are strong.’ This stirr’d a speed
11295,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In Thoas to th’ affair; whose purple weed
11296,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He left for haste; which then I took, and lay"
11297,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In quiet after, till the dawn of day."
11298,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This shift Ulysses made for one in need,"
11299,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And would to heav’n, that youth such spirit did feed"
11300,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now in my nerves, and that my joints were knit"
11301,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With such a strength as made me then held fit
11302,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To lead men with Ulysses! I should then
11303,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Seem worth a weed that fits a herdsman’s men,"
11304,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For two respects, to gain a thankful friend,"
11305,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And to a good man’s need a good extend.”
11306,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O father,” said Eumæus “thou hast shown"
11307,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Good cause for us to give thee good renown,"
11308,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Not using any word that was not freed
11309,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From all least ill. Thou, therefore, shalt not need"
11310,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or coat, or other thing, that aptly may"
11311,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Beseem a wretched suppliant for defray
11312,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of this night’s need. But, when her golden throne"
11313,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The morn ascends, you must resume your own,"
11314,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For here you must not dream of many weeds,"
11315,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or any change at all. We serve our needs
11316,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As you do yours; one back, one coat. But when"
11317,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses’ lovéd son returns, he then"
11318,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall give you coat and cassock, and bestow"
11319,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your person where your heart and soul is now,”"
11320,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he rose, made near the fire his bed,"
11321,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which all with goats’ and sheep skins he bespread.
11322,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All which Ulysses with himself did line,"
11323,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With whom; besides, he chang’d a gaberdine,"
11324,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thick lin’d, and soft, which still he made his shift"
11325,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When he would dress him ’gainst the horrid drift
11326,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of tempest, when deep winter’s season blows."
11327,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor pleas’d it him to lie there with his sows,"
11328,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But while Ulysses slept there, and close by"
11329,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The other younkers, he abroad would lie,"
11330,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And therefore arm’d him. Which set cheerful fare
11331,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before Ulysses’ heart, to see such care"
11332,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his goods taken, how far off soever"
11333,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His fate his person and his wealth should sever.
11334,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"First then, a sharp-edg’d sword he girt about"
11335,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His well-spread shoulders, and (to shelter out"
11336,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The sharp West wind that blew) he put him on
11337,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A thick-lin’d jacket, and yet cast upon"
11338,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All that the large hide of a goat well-fed.
11339,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A lance then took he, with a keen steel head,"
11340,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To be his keep-off both ’gainst men and dogs.
11341,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thus went he to rest with his male hogs,"
11342,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That still abroad lay underneath a rock,"
11343,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Shield to the North wind’s ever-eager shock.

11438,O.,"Which yet I think will fail, and some of them"
11439,O.,That waste thy fortunes taste of that extreme
11440,O.,"They plot for thee. But keep off far from shore,"
11441,O.,"And day and night sail, for a fore-right blore,"
11442,O.,Whoever of th’ Immortals that vow guard
11443,O.,"And ’scape to thy return, will see prepar’d."
11444,O.,"As soon as thou arriv’st, dismiss to town"
11445,O.,"Thy ship and men, and first of all make down"
11446,O.,"To him that keeps thy swine, and doth conceive"
11447,O.,A tender care to see thee well survive.
11448,O.,"There sleep; and send him to the town, to tell"
11449,O.,"The chaste Penelopé, that safe and well"
11450,O.,"Thou liv’st in his charge, and that Pylos’ sands"
11451,O.,The place contain’d from whence thy person lands.”
11452,O.,Thus she to large Olympus made ascent.
11453,O.,When with his heel a little touch he lent
11454,O.,"To Nestor’s son, whose sleep’s sweet chains he loos’d,"
11455,O.,"Bad rise, and see in chariot inclos’d"
11456,O.,"Their one-hoof’d horse, that they might straight be gone."
11457,O.,"“No such haste,” he replied, “Night holds her throne,"
11458,O.,And dims all way to course of chariot.
11459,O.,The morn will soon get up. Nor see forgot
11460,O.,"The gifts with haste, that will, I know, be rich,"
11461,O.,And put into our coach with gracious speech
11462,O.,By lance-fam’d Menelaus. Not a guest
11463,O.,"Shall touch at his house, but shall store his breast"
11464,O.,"With fit mind of an hospitable man,"
11465,O.,To last as long as any daylight can
11466,O.,"His eyes recomfort, in such gifts as he"
11467,O.,Will proofs make of his hearty royalty.”
11468,O.,"He had no sooner said, but up arose"
11469,O.,"Aurora, that the golden hills repose."
11470,O.,"And Menelaus, good-at-martial-cries,"
11471,O.,"From Helen’s bed rais’d, to his guest applies"
11472,O.,His first appearance. Whose repair made known
11473,O.,"T’ Ulysses’ lov’d son, on his robe was thrown"
11474,O.,"About his gracious body, his cloak cast"
11475,O.,"Athwart his ample shoulders, and in haste"
11476,O.,"Abroad he went, and did the king accost:"
11477,O.,"“Atrides, guarded with heav’n’s deified host,"
11478,O.,"Grant now remission to my native right,"
11479,O.,My mind now urging mine own house’s sight.”
11480,O.,"“Nor will I stay,” said he, “thy person long,"
11481,O.,Since thy desires to go are grown so strong.
11482,O.,I should myself be angry to sustain
11483,O.,The like detention urg’d by other men.
11484,O.,"Who loves a guest past mean, past mean will hate,"
11485,O.,_The mean in all acts bears the best estate._
11486,O.,"A like ill ’tis, to thrust out such a guest"
11487,O.,"As would not go, as to detain the rest."
11488,O.,"We should a guest love, while he loves to stay,"
11489,O.,"And, when he likes not, give him loving way."
11490,O.,"Yet suffer so, that we may gifts impose"
11491,O.,"In coach to thee; which ere our hands inclose,"
11492,O.,"Thine eyes shall see, lest else our loves may glose."
11493,O.,"Besides, I’ll cause our women to prepare"
11494,O.,"What our house yields, and merely so much fare"
11495,O.,"As may suffice for health. Both well will do,"
11496,O.,Both for our honour and our profit too.
11497,O.,"And, serving strength with food, you after may"
11498,O.,As much earth measure as will match the clay.
11499,O.,"If you will turn your course from sea, and go"
11500,O.,Through Greece and Argos (that myself may so
11501,O.,"Keep kind way with thee) I’ll join horse, and guide"
11502,O.,T’ our human cities. Nor ungratified
11503,O.,Will anyone remit us; some one thing
11504,O.,"Will each present us, that along may bring"
11505,O.,"Our pass with love, and prove our virtues blaz’d:"
11506,O.,"A caldron, or a tripod, richly-braz’d,"
11507,O.,"Two mules, a bowl of gold, that hath his price"
11508,O.,Heighten’d with emblems of some rare device.”
11509,O.,The wise prince answer’d: “I would gladly go
11510,O.,"Home to mine own, and see that govern’d so"
11511,O.,"That I may keep what I for certain hold,"
11512,O.,Not hazard that for only hop’d-for gold.
11513,O.,I left behind me none so all ways fit
11514,O.,"To give it guard, as mine own trust with it."
11515,O.,"Besides, in this broad course which you propose,"
11516,O.,My father seeking I myself may lose.”
11517,O.,"When this the shrill-voic’d Menelaus heard,"
11518,O.,He charg’d his queen and maids to see prepar’d
11519,O.,"Breakfast, of what the whole house held for best."
11520,O.,"To him rose Eteoneus from his rest,"
11521,O.,"Whose dwelling was not far off from the court,"
11522,O.,And his attendance his command did sort
11523,O.,"With kindling fires, and furth’ring all the roast,"
11524,O.,In act of whose charge heard no time he lost.
11525,O.,"Himself then to an odorous room descended,"
11526,O.,Whom Megapenthe and his queen attended.
11527,O.,"Come to his treasury, a two-ear’d cup"
11528,O.,"He choos’d of all, and made his son bear up"
11529,O.,A silver bowl. The queen then taking stand
11530,O.,"Aside her chest, where by her own fair hand"
11531,O.,"Lay vests of all hues wrought, she took out one"
11532,O.,"Most large, most artful, chiefly fair, and shone"
11533,O.,"Like to a star, and lay of all the last."
11534,O.,Then through the house with either’s gift they past;
11535,O.,When to Ulysses’ son Atrides said:
11536,O.,"“Telemachus, since so entirely sway’d"
11537,O.,"Thy thoughts are with thy vow’d return now tender’d,"
11538,O.,May Juno’s thund’ring husband see it render’d
11539,O.,"Perfect at all parts, action answ’ring thought."
11540,O.,"Of all the rich gifts, in my treasure sought,"
11541,O.,I give thee here the most in grace and best.
11542,O.,"A bowl but silver, yet the brim’s comprest"
11543,O.,"With gold, whose fabric his desert doth bring"
11544,O.,"From Vulcan’s hand, presented by the king"
11545,O.,"And great heroë of Sidonia’s state,"
11546,O.,When at our parting he did consummate
11547,O.,His whole house-keeping. This do thou command.”
11548,O.,"This said, he put the round bowl in his hand,"
11549,O.,And then his strong son Megapenthe plac’d
11550,O.,"The silver cup before him, amply grac’d"
11551,O.,"With work and lustre. Helen (standing by,"
11552,O.,"And in her hand the robe, her housewifery)"
11553,O.,"His name rememb’ring, said: “And I present,"
11554,O.,"Lov’d son, this gift to thee, the monument"
11555,O.,"Of the so-many-lovéd Helen’s hands,"
11556,O.,"Which, at the knitting of thy nuptial bands,"
11557,O.,"Present thy wife. In mean space, may it lie"
11558,O.,By thy lov’d mother; but to me apply
11559,O.,"Thy pleasure in it, and thus take thy way"
11560,O.,"To thy fair house, and country’s wishéd stay.”"
11561,O.,"Thus gave she to his hands the veil, and he"
11562,O.,The acceptation author’d joyfully.
11563,O.,Which in the chariot’s chest Pisistratus
11564,O.,"Plac’d with the rest, and held miraculous."
11565,O.,The yellow-headed king then led them all
11566,O.,To seats and thrones plac’d in his spacious hall.
11567,O.,"The hand-maid water brought, and gave it stream"
11568,O.,"From out a fair and golden ewer to them,"
11569,O.,From whose hands to a silver caldron fled
11570,O.,"The troubled wave. A bright board then she spread,"
11571,O.,On which another rev’rend dame set bread.
11572,O.,To which more servants store of victuals serv’d.
11573,O.,"Eteonëus was the man that kerv’d,"
11574,O.,And Megapenthe fill’d them all their wine.
11575,O.,"All fed and drank, till all felt care decline"
11576,O.,For those refreshings. Both the guests did go
11577,O.,"To horse, and coach, and forth the portico"
11578,O.,"A little issued, when the yellow King"
11579,O.,"Brought wine himself, that, with an offering"
11580,O.,"To all the Gods, they might their journey take."
11581,O.,"He stood before the Gods, and thus he spake:"
11582,O.,“Farewell young Princes! To grave Nestor’s ear
11583,O.,This salutation from my gratitude bear:
11584,O.,"That I profess, in all our Ilion wars,"
11585,O.,He stood a careful father to my cares.”
11586,O.,To whom the wise Ulyssides replied:
11587,O.,"“With all our utmost shall be signified,"
11588,O.,"Jove-kept Atrides, your right royal will;"
11589,O.,"And would to God, I could as well fulfill"
11590,O.,"Mine own mind’s gratitude, for your free grace,"
11591,O.,"In telling to Ulysses, in the place"
11592,O.,"Of my return, in what accomplish’d kind"
11593,O.,I have obtain’d the office of a friend
11594,O.,At your deservings; whose fair end you crown
11595,O.,"With gifts so many, and of such renown!”"
11596,O.,"His wish, that he might find in his retreat"
11597,O.,His father safe return’d (to so repeat
11598,O.,The king’s love to him) was saluted thus:
11599,O.,"An eagle rose, and in her seres did truss"
11600,O.,"A goose, all-white, and huge, a household one,"
11601,O.,"Which men and women, crying out upon,"
11602,O.,"Pursued, but she, being near the guests, her flight"
11603,O.,"Made on their right hand, and kept still fore-right"
11604,O.,"Before their horses; which observ’d by them,"
11605,O.,"The spirits in all their minds took joys extreme,"
11606,O.,"Which Nestor’s son thus question’d: “Jove-kept king,[2]"
11607,O.,"Yield your grave thoughts, if this ostentful thing"
11608,O.,"(This eagle, and this goose) touch us, or you?”"
11609,O.,"He put to study, and not knowing how"
11610,O.,"To give fit answer, Helen took on her"
11611,O.,"Th’ ostent’s solution, and did this prefer:"
11612,O.,"“Hear me, and I will play the prophet’s part,"
11613,O.,"As the Immortals cast it in my heart,"
11614,O.,"And as, I think, will make the true sense known:"
11615,O.,"As this Jove’s bird, from out the mountains flown,"
11616,O.,"(Where was her eyrie, and whence rose her race,)"
11617,O.,"Truss’d up this goose, that from the house did graze,"
11618,O.,"So shall Ulysses, coming from the wild"
11619,O.,"Of seas and suff’rings, reach, unreconcil’d,"
11620,O.,"His native home, where ev’n this hour he is,"
11621,O.,And on those house-fed Wooers those wrongs of his
11622,O.,"Will shortly wreak, with all their miseries.”"
11623,O.,"“O,” said Telemachus, “if Saturnian Jove"
11624,O.,"To my desires thy dear presage approve,"
11625,O.,"When I arrive, I will perform to thee"
11626,O.,"My daily vows, as to a Deity.”"
11627,O.,"This said, he us’d his scourge upon the horse,"
11628,O.,That through the city freely made their course
11629,O.,"To field, and all day made that first speed good."
11630,O.,"But when the sun set, and obscureness stood"
11631,O.,"In each man’s way, they ended their access"
11632,O.,"At Pheras, in the house of Diocles,"
11633,O.,"Son to Orsilochus, Alphëus’ seed,"
11634,O.,Who gave them guest-rites; and sleep’s natural need
11635,O.,"They that night served there. When Aurora rose,"
11636,O.,"They join’d their horse, took coach, and did dispose"
11637,O.,Their course for Pylos; whose high city soon
11638,O.,They reach’d. Nor would Telemachus be won
11639,O.,"To Nestor’s house, and therefore order’d thus"
11640,O.,"His speech to Nestor’s son, Pisistratus:"
11641,O.,“How shall I win thy promise to a grace
11642,O.,That I must ask of thee? We both embrace
11643,O.,"The names of bed-fellows, and in that name"
11644,O.,Will glory as an adjunct of our fame;
11645,O.,"Our fathers’ friendship, our own equal age,"
11646,O.,"And our joint travel, may the more engage"
11647,O.,"Our mutual concord. Do not then assay,"
11648,O.,"My God-lov’d friend, to lead me from my way"
11649,O.,"To my near ship, but take a course direct"
11650,O.,"And leave me there, lest thy old sire’s respect,"
11651,O.,"In his desire to love me, hinder so"
11652,O.,"My way for home, that have such need to go.”"
11653,O.,"This said, Nestorides held all discourse"
11654,O.,"In his kind soul, how best he might enforce"
11655,O.,"Both promise and performance; which, at last;"
11656,O.,"He vow’d to venture, and directly cast"
11657,O.,His horse about to fetch the ship and shore.
11658,O.,"Where come, his friends’ most lovely gifts he bore"
11659,O.,"Aboard the ship, and in her hind-deck plac’d"
11660,O.,"The veil that Helen’s curious hand had grac’d,"
11661,O.,"And Menelaus’ gold, and said: “Away,"
11662,O.,"Nor let thy men, in any least date, stay,"
11663,O.,"But quite put off, ere I get home, and tell"
11664,O.,"The old duke, you are past; for passing well"
11665,O.,I know his mind to so exceed all force
11666,O.,"Of any pray’r, that he will stay your course,"
11667,O.,"Himself make hither, all your course call back,"
11668,O.,"And, when he hath you, have no thought to rack"
11669,O.,"Him from his bounty, and to let you part"
11670,O.,"Without a present, but be vex’d at heart"
11671,O.,"With both our pleadings, if we once put move"
11672,O.,The least repression of his fiery love.”
11673,O.,"Thus took he coach, his fair-man’d steeds scourg’d on"
11674,O.,"Along the Pylian city, and anon"
11675,O.,His father’s court reach’d; while Ulysses’ son
11676,O.,"Bade board, and arm; which with a thought was done."
11677,O.,"His rowers set, and he rich odours firing"
11678,O.,"In his hind-deck, for his secure retiring,"
11679,O.,"To great Athenia, to his ship came flying"
11680,O.,"A stranger, and a prophet, as relying"
11681,O.,"On wishéd passage, having newly slain"
11682,O.,"A man at Argos, yet his race’s vein"
11683,O.,"Flow’d from Melampus, who in former date"
11684,O.,"In Pylos liv’d, and had a huge estate,"
11685,O.,"But fled his country, and the punishing hand"
11686,O.,"Of great-soul’d Neleus, in a foreign land,"
11687,O.,"From that most famous mortal, having held"
11688,O.,"A world of riches, nor could be compell’d"
11689,O.,To render restitution in a year.
11690,O.,"In mean space, living as close prisoner"
11691,O.,"In court of Phylacus, and for the sake"
11692,O.,"Of Neleus’ daughter mighty cares did take,"
11693,O.,Together with a grievous languor sent
11694,O.,"From grave Erinnys, that did much torment"
11695,O.,His vexéd conscience; yet his life’s expence
11696,O.,"He scap’d, and drave the loud-voiced oxen thence,"
11697,O.,"To breed-sheep Pylos, bringing vengeance thus"
11698,O.,"Her foul demerit to great Neleüs,"
11699,O.,And to his brother’s house reduc’d his wife.
11700,O.,Who yet from Pylos did remove his life
11701,O.,"For feed-horse Argos, where his fate set down"
11702,O.,"A dwelling for him, and in much renown"
11703,O.,"Made govern many Argives, where a spouse"
11704,O.,"He took to him, and built a famous house."
11705,O.,"There had he born to him Antiphates,"
11706,O.,And forceful Mantius. To the first of these
11707,O.,Was great Oïcleus born: Oïcleus gat
11708,O.,"Amphiaraus, that the popular state"
11709,O.,"Had all their health in, whom ev’n from his heart"
11710,O.,"Jove lov’d, and Phœbus in the whole desert"
11711,O.,Of friendship held him; yet not bless’d so much
11712,O.,"That age’s threshold he did ever touch,"
11713,O.,But lost his life by female bribery.[3]
11714,O.,"Yet two sons author’d his posterity,"
11715,O.,"Alcmæon, and renown’d Amphilochus."
11716,O.,"Mantius had issue Polyphidius,"
11717,O.,"And Clytus, but Aurora ravish’d him,"
11718,O.,"For excellence of his admiréd limb,"
11719,O.,And interested him amongst the Gods.
11720,O.,His brother knew men’s good and bad abodes
11721,O.,"The best of all men, after the decease"
11722,O.,Of him that perish’d in unnatural peace
11723,O.,At spacious Thebes. Apollo did inspire
11724,O.,His knowing soul with a prophetic fire.
11725,O.,"Who, angry with his father, took his way"
11726,O.,"To Hyperesia; where, making stay,"
11727,O.,"He prophesied to all men, and had there"
11728,O.,"A son call’d Theoclymenus, who here"
11729,O.,"Came to Telemachus, and found aboard"
11730,O.,"Himself at sacrifice, whom in a word"
11731,O.,"He thus saluted: “O friend, since I find,"
11732,O.,"Ev’n here at ship, a sacrificing mind"
11733,O.,"Inform your actions, by your sacrifice,"
11734,O.,And by that worthy choice of Deities
11735,O.,"To whom you offer, by yourself, and all"
11736,O.,"These men that serve your course maritimal,"
11737,O.,"Tell one that asks the truth, nor give it glose,"
11738,O.,"Both who, and whence, you are? From what seed rose"
11739,O.,Your royal person? And what city’s tow’rs
11740,O.,Hold habitation to your parents’ pow’rs?”
11741,O.,He answer’d: “Stranger! The sure truth is this:
11742,O.,I am of Ithaca; my father is
11743,O.,"(Or was) Ulysses, but austere death now"
11744,O.,Takes his state from him; whose event to know
11745,O.,"Himself being long away, I set forth thus"
11746,O.,With ship and soldiers.” Theoclymenus
11747,O.,As freely said: “And I to thee am fled
11748,O.,"From forth my country, for a man struck dead"
11749,O.,"By my unhappy hand, who was with me"
11750,O.,"Of one self-tribe, and of his pedigree"
11751,O.,"Are many friends and brothers, and the sway"
11752,O.,Of Achive kindred reacheth far away.
11753,O.,"From whom, because I fear their spleens suborn"
11754,O.,Blood and black fate against me (being born
11755,O.,To be a wand’rer among foreign men)
11756,O.,"Make thy fair ship my rescue, and sustain"
11757,O.,My life from slaughter. Thy deservings may
11758,O.,"Perform that mercy, and to them I pray.”"
11759,O.,"“Nor will I bar,” said he, “thy will to make"
11760,O.,"My means and equal ship thy aid, but take"
11761,O.,"(With what we have here, in all friendly use)"
11762,O.,Thy life from any violence that pursues.”
11763,O.,"Thus took he in his lance, and it extended"
11764,O.,"Aloft the hatches, which himself ascended."
11765,O.,"The prince took seat at stern, on his right hand"
11766,O.,"Set Theoclymenus, and gave command"
11767,O.,"To all his men to arm, and see made fast"
11768,O.,Amidst the hollow keel the beechen mast
11769,O.,"With able halsers, hoise sail, launch; which soon"
11770,O.,He saw obey’d. And then his ship did run
11771,O.,A merry course; blue-eyed Minerva sent
11772,O.,"A fore-right gale, tumultuous, vehement,"
11773,O.,"Along the air, that her way’s utmost yield"
11774,O.,"The ship might make, and plough the brackish field."
11775,O.,"Then set the sun, and night black’d all the ways."
11776,O.,"The ship, with Jove’s wind wing’d, where th’ Epian sways,"
11777,O.,"Fetch’d Pheras first, then Elis the divine,"
11778,O.,"And then for those isles made, that sea-ward shine"
11779,O.,"For form and sharpness like a lance’s head,"
11780,O.,About which lay the Wooers ambushéd;
11781,O.,"On which he rush’d, to try if he could ’scape"
11782,O.,"His plotted death, or serve her treach’rous rape."
11783,O.,"And now return we to Eumæus’ shed,"
11784,O.,"Where, at their food with others marshalléd,"
11785,O.,Ulysses and his noble herdsman sate.
11786,O.,To try if whose love’s curious estate
11787,O.,"Stood firm to his abode, or felt it fade,"
11788,O.,And so would take each best cause to persuade
11789,O.,"His guest to town, Ulysses thus contends:"
11790,O.,"“Hear me, Eumæus, and ye other friends."
11791,O.,"Next morn to town I covet to be gone,"
11792,O.,"To beg some others’ alms, not still charge one."
11793,O.,"Advise me well then, and as well provide"
11794,O.,"I may be fitted with an honest guide,"
11795,O.,"For through the streets, since need will have it so,"
11796,O.,"I’ll tread, to try if any will bestow"
11797,O.,"A dish of drink on me, or bit of bread,"
11798,O.,Till to Ulysses’ house I may be led;
11799,O.,"And there I’ll tell all-wise Penelope news,"
11800,O.,"Mix with the Wooers’ pride, and, since they use"
11801,O.,"To fare above the full, their hands excite"
11802,O.,To some small feast from out their infinite:
11803,O.,"For which, I’ll wait, and play the servingman,"
11804,O.,"Fairly enough, command the most they can."
11805,O.,"For I will tell thee, note me well, and hear,"
11806,O.,"That, if the will be of Heav’n’s Messenger,"
11807,O.,"(Who to the works of men, of any sort,"
11808,O.,"Can grace infuse, and glory) nothing short"
11809,O.,"Am I of him, that doth to most aspire"
11810,O.,"In any service, as to build a fire,"
11811,O.,"To cleave sere wood, to roast or boil their meat,"
11812,O.,"To wait at board, mix wine, or know the neat,"
11813,O.,"Or any work, in which the poor-call’d worst"
11814,O.,To serve the rich-call’d best in Fate are forc’d.”
11815,O.,"He, angry with him, said: “Alas, poor guest,"
11816,O.,Why did this counsel ever touch thy breast?
11817,O.,"Thou seek’st thy utter spoil beyond all doubt,"
11818,O.,"If thou giv’st venture on the Wooers’ rout,"
11819,O.,"Whose wrong and force affects the iron heav’n,"
11820,O.,Their light delights are far from being giv’n
11821,O.,To such grave servitors. Youths richly trick’d
11822,O.,"In coats or cassocks, locks divinely slick’d,"
11823,O.,"And looks most rapting, ever have the gift"
11824,O.,"To taste their crown’d cups, and full trenchers shift."
11825,O.,"Their tables ever like their glasses shine,"
11826,O.,"Loaded with bread, with varied flesh, and wine."
11827,O.,"And thou go thither? Stay, for here do none"
11828,O.,"Grudge at thy presence, nor myself, nor one"
11829,O.,Of all I feed. But when Ulysses’ son
11830,O.,"Again shall greet us, he shall put thee on"
11831,O.,"Both coat and cassock, and thy quick retreat"
11832,O.,Set where thy heart and soul desire thy seat.”
11833,O.,Industrious Ulysses gave reply:
11834,O.,"“I still much wish, that Heav’n’s chief Deity"
11835,O.,"Lov’d thee, as I do, that hast eas’d my mind"
11836,O.,Of woes and wand’rings never yet confin’d.
11837,O.,"_Nought is more wretched in a human race,"
11838,O.,"Than country’s want, and shift from place to place._"
11839,O.,But for the baneful belly men take care
11840,O.,"Beyond good counsel, whosoever are"
11841,O.,In compass of the wants it undergoes
11842,O.,"By wand’rings, losses, or dependent woes."
11843,O.,"Excuse me therefore, if I err’d at home;"
11844,O.,"Which since thou wilt make here, as overcome"
11845,O.,"With thy command for stay, I’ll take on me"
11846,O.,"Cares appertaining to this place, like thee."
11847,O.,"Does then Ulysses’ sire, and mother, breathe,"
11848,O.,Both whom he left in th’ age next door to death?
11849,O.,"Or are they breathless, and descended where"
11850,O.,"The dark house is, that never day doth clear?”"
11851,O.,"“Laertes lives,” said he, “but ev’ry hour"
11852,O.,Beseecheth Jove to take from him the pow’r
11853,O.,That joins his life and limbs; for with a moan
11854,O.,That breeds a marvel he laments his son
11855,O.,"Depriv’d by death, and adds to that another"
11856,O.,"Of no less depth for that dead son’s dead mother,"
11857,O.,"Whom he a virgin wedded, which the more"
11858,O.,"Makes him lament her loss, and doth deplore"
11859,O.,"Yet more her miss, because her womb the truer"
11860,O.,"Was to his brave son, and his slaughter slew her."
11861,O.,"Which last love to her doth his life engage,"
11862,O.,And makes him live an undigested age.
11863,O.,O! such a death she died as never may
11864,O.,"Seize anyone that here beholds the day,"
11865,O.,"That either is to any man a friend,"
11866,O.,Or can a woman kill in such a kind.
11867,O.,"As long as she had being, I would be"
11868,O.,"A still inquirer (since ’twas dear to me,"
11869,O.,"Though death to her, to hear his name) when she"
11870,O.,"Heard of Ulysses, for I might be bold,"
11871,O.,"She brought me up, and in her love did hold"
11872,O.,"My life, compar’d with long-veil’d Ctimené,"
11873,O.,Her youngest issue (in some small degree
11874,O.,Her daughter yet preferr’d) a brave young dame.
11875,O.,And when of youth the dearly-lovéd flame
11876,O.,"Was lighted in us, marriage did prefer"
11877,O.,The maid to Samos; whence was sent for her
11878,O.,"Infinite riches, when the queen bestow’d"
11879,O.,"A fair new suit, new shoes, and all, and vow’d"
11880,O.,"Me to the field, but passing loth to part,"
11881,O.,As loving me more than she lov’d her heart.
11882,O.,And these I want now; but their business grows
11883,O.,"Upon me daily, which the Gods impose,"
11884,O.,"To whom I hold all, give account to them,"
11885,O.,For I see none left to the diadem
11886,O.,"That may dispose all better. So, I drink"
11887,O.,And eat of what is here; and whom I think
11888,O.,"Worthy or rev’rend, I have giv’n to, still,"
11889,O.,These kinds of guest-rites; for the household ill
11890,O.,"(Which, where the queen is, riots) takes her still"
11891,O.,From thought of these things. Nor is it delight
11892,O.,"To hear, from her plight, of or work or word;"
11893,O.,The Wooers spoil all. But yet my men will board
11894,O.,"Her sorrows often with discourse of all,"
11895,O.,Eating and drinking of the festival
11896,O.,"That there is kept, and after bring to field"
11897,O.,Such things as servants make their pleasures yield.”

11899,O.,"“O me, Eumæus,” said Laertes’ son,"
11900,O.,"“Hast thou then err’d so of a little one,"

11904,O.,"Where dwelt thy sire and rev’rend mother then,"
11905,O.,"That thou art spar’d there? Or else, set alone"
11906,O.,"In guard of beeves, or sheep, set th’ enemy on,"
11907,O.,"Surpris’d, and shipp’d, transferr’d, and sold thee here?"
11908,O.,"He that bought thee paid well, yet bought not dear.”"
11909,O.,"“Since thou enquir’st of that, my guest,” said he,"
11910,O.,"“Hear and be silent, and, mean space, sit free"
11911,O.,In use of these cups to thy most delights;
11912,O.,Unspeakable in length now are the nights.
11913,O.,"Those that affect sleep yet, to sleep have leave,"
11914,O.,"Those that affect to hear, their hearers give."

11916,O.,"Whoever lists to sleep, away to bed,"
11917,O.,"Together with the morning raise his head,"
11918,O.,"Together with his fellows break his fast,"
11919,O.,And then his lord’s herd drive to their repast.
11920,O.,"We two, still in our tabernacle here"
11921,O.,"Drinking and eating, will our bosoms cheer"
11922,O.,With memories and tales of our annoys.

11926,O.,"There is an isle above Ortygia,"
11927,O.,"If thou hast heard, they call it Syria,"
11928,O.,"Where, once a day, the sun moves backward still."
11929,O.,"’Tis not so great as good, for it doth fill"
11930,O.,"The fields with oxen, fills them still with sheep,"
11931,O.,"Fills roofs with wine, and makes all corn there cheap."
11932,O.,"No dearth comes ever there, nor no disease"
11933,O.,"That doth with hate us wretched mortals seize,"
11934,O.,"But when men’s varied nations, dwelling there"
11935,O.,"In any city, enter th’ aged year,"
11936,O.,"The silver-bow-bearer, the Sun, and She"
11937,O.,"That bears as much renown for archery,"
11938,O.,"Stoop with their painless shafts, and strike them dead,"
11939,O.,"As one would sleep, and never keep the bed."
11940,O.,"In this isle stand two cities, betwixt whom"
11941,O.,All things that of the soil’s fertility come
11942,O.,In two parts are divided. And both these
11943,O.,"My father rul’d, Ctesius Ormenides,"
11944,O.,A man like the Immortals. With these states
11945,O.,The cross-biting Phœnicians traffick’d rates
11946,O.,"Of infinite merchandise in ships brought there,"
11947,O.,In which they then were held exempt from peer.
11948,O.,"There dwelt within my father’s house a dame,"
11949,O.,"Born a Phœnician, skilful in the frame"
11950,O.,"Of noble housewif’ries, right tall and fair."
11951,O.,Her the Phœnician great-wench-net-lay’r[5]
11952,O.,"With sweet words circumvented, as she was"
11953,O.,Washing her linen. To his amorous pass
11954,O.,"He brought her first, shor’d from his ship to her;"
11955,O.,"To whom he did his whole life’s love prefer,"
11956,O.,Which of these breast-exposing dames the hearts
11957,O.,"Deceives, though fashion’d of right honest parts."
11958,O.,"He ask’d her after, what she was, and whence?"
11959,O.,"She, passing presently, the excellence"
11960,O.,"Told of her father’s turrets, and that she"
11961,O.,Might boast herself sprung from the progeny
11962,O.,"Of the rich Sidons, and the daughter was"
11963,O.,Of the much-year-revénued Arybas;
11964,O.,"But that the Taphian pirates made her prise,"
11965,O.,"As she return’d from her field-housewif’ries,"
11966,O.,"Transferr’d her hither, and, at that man’s house"
11967,O.,"Where now she liv’d, for value precious"
11968,O.,Sold her to th’ owner. He that stole her love
11969,O.,"Bade her again to her birth’s seat remove,"
11970,O.,"To see the fair roofs of her friends again,"
11971,O.,"Who still held state, and did the port maintain"
11972,O.,"Herself reported. She said: ‘Be it so,"
11973,O.,"So you, and all that in your ship shall row,"
11974,O.,Swear to return me in all safety hence.’
11975,O.,"All swore. Th’ oath past, with ev’ry consequence,"
11976,O.,"She bade: ‘Be silent now, and not a word"
11977,O.,"Do you, or any of your friends, afford,"
11978,O.,"Meeting me afterward in any way,"
11979,O.,Or at the washing-fount; lest some display
11980,O.,"Be made, and told the old man, and he then"
11981,O.,"Keep me strait bound, to you and to your men"
11982,O.,The utter ruin plotting of your lives.
11983,O.,Keep in firm thought then ev’ry word that strives
11984,O.,For dang’rous utt’rance. Haste your ship’s full freight
11985,O.,"Of what you traffic for, and let me straight"
11986,O.,"Know by some sent friend she hath all in hold,"
11987,O.,And with myself I’ll bring thence all the gold
11988,O.,"I can by all means finger; and, beside,"
11989,O.,I’ll do my best to see your freight supplied
11990,O.,With some well-weighing burthen of mine own.
11991,O.,"For I bring-up in house a great man’s son,"
11992,O.,"As crafty as myself, who will with me"
11993,O.,"Run ev’ry way along, and I will be"
11994,O.,"His leader, till your ship hath made him sure."
11995,O.,"He will an infinite great price procure,"
11996,O.,Transfer him to what languag’d men ye may.’
11997,O.,"This said, she gat her home, and there made stay"
11998,O.,"A whole year with us, goods of great avail"
11999,O.,"Their ship enriching. Which now fit for sail,"
12000,O.,They sent a messenger t’ inform the dame;
12001,O.,"And to my father’s house a fellow came,"
12002,O.,"Full of Phœnician craft, that to be sold"
12003,O.,"A tablet brought, the body all of gold,"
12004,O.,The verge all-amber. This had ocular view
12005,O.,Both by my honour’d mother and the crew
12006,O.,"Of her house-handmaids, handled, and the price"
12007,O.,"Beat, ask’d, and promis’d. And while this device"
12008,O.,"Lay thus upon the forge, this jeweller"
12009,O.,"Made privy signs, by winks and wiles, to her"
12010,O.,"That was his object; which she took, and he,"
12011,O.,"His sign seeing noted, hied to ship. When she,"
12012,O.,"(My hand still taking, as she us’d to do"
12013,O.,To walk abroad with her) convey’d me so
12014,O.,"Abroad with her, and in the portico"
12015,O.,"Found cups, with tasted viands, which the guests"
12016,O.,That us’d to flock about my father’s feasts
12017,O.,"Had left. They gone (some to the council-court,"
12018,O.,Some to hear news amongst the talking sort)
12019,O.,"Her theft three bowls into her lap convey’d,"
12020,O.,And forth she went. Nor was my wit so stay’d
12021,O.,"To stay her, or myself. The sun went down,"
12022,O.,"And shadows round about the world were flown,"
12023,O.,"When we came to the haven, in which did ride"
12024,O.,The swift Phœnician ship; whose fair broad side
12025,O.,"They boarded straight, took us up; and all went"
12026,O.,Along the moist waves. Wind Saturnius sent.
12027,O.,Six days we day and night sail’d; but when Jove
12028,O.,"Put up the seventh day, She that shafts doth love"
12029,O.,"Shot dead the woman, who into the pump"
12030,O.,"Like to a dop-chick div’d, and gave a thump"
12031,O.,In her sad settling. Forth they cast her then
12032,O.,"To serve the fish and sea-calves, no more men;"
12033,O.,But I was left there with a heavy heart;
12034,O.,When wind and water drave them quit apart
12035,O.,"Their own course, and on Ithaca they fell,"
12036,O.,And there poor me did to Laertes sell.
12037,O.,And thus these eyes the sight of this isle prov’d.”
12038,O.,"“Eumæus,” he replied, “thou much hast mov’d"
12039,O.,"The mind in me with all things thou hast said,"
12040,O.,"And all the suff’rance on thy bosom laid,"
12041,O.,"But, truly, to thy ill hath Jove join’d good,"
12042,O.,That one whose veins are serv’d with human blood
12043,O.,"Hath bought thy service, that gives competence"
12044,O.,"Of food, wine, cloth to thee; and sure th’ expence"
12045,O.,"Of thy life’s date here is of good desert,"
12046,O.,Whose labours not to thee alone impart
12047,O.,"Sufficient food and housing, but to me;"
12048,O.,Where I through many a heap’d humanity
12049,O.,"Have hither err’d, where, though, like thee, not sold,"
12050,O.,"Nor stay’d like thee yet, nor nought needful hold.”"
12051,O.,"This mutual speech they us’d, nor had they slept"
12052,O.,Much time before the much-near morning leapt
12053,O.,To her fair throne. And now struck sail the men
12054,O.,"That serv’d Telemachus, arriv’d just then"
12055,O.,"Near his lov’d shore; where now they stoop’d the mast,"
12056,O.,"Made to the port with oars, and anchor cast,"
12057,O.,"Made fast the ship, and then ashore they went,"
12058,O.,"Dress’d supper, fill’d wine; when (their appetites spent)"
12059,O.,Telemachus commanded they should yield
12060,O.,"The ship to th’ owner, while himself at field"
12061,O.,Would see his shepherds; when light drew to end
12062,O.,"He would his gifts see, and to town descend,"
12063,O.,And in the morning at a feast bestow
12064,O.,"Rewards for all their pains. “And whither, now,”"
12065,O.,"Said Theoclymenus, “my lovéd son,"
12066,O.,"Shall I address myself? Whose mansión,"
12067,O.,"Of all men, in this rough-hewn isle, shall I"
12068,O.,Direct my way to? Or go readily
12069,O.,To thy house and thy mother?” He replied:
12070,O.,“Another time I’ll see you satisfied
12071,O.,"With my house-entertainment, but as now"
12072,O.,You should encounter none that could bestow
12073,O.,"Your fit entreaty, and (which less grace were)"
12074,O.,"You could not see my mother, I not there;"
12075,O.,"For she’s no frequent object, but apart"
12076,O.,"Keeps from her Wooers, woo’d with her desert,"
12077,O.,"Up in her chamber, at her housewif’ry"
12078,O.,But I’ll name one to whom you shall apply
12079,O.,"Direct repair, and that’s Eurymachus,"
12080,O.,"Renown’d descent to wise Polybius,"
12081,O.,A man whom th’ Ithacensians look on now
12082,O.,"As on a God, since he of all that woo"
12083,O.,"Is far superior man, and likest far"
12084,O.,"To wed my mother, and as circular"
12085,O.,Be in that honour as Ulysses was.
12086,O.,But heav’n-hous’d Jove knows the yet hidden pass
12087,O.,"Of her disposure, and on them he may"
12088,O.,A blacker sight bring than her nuptial day.”
12089,O.,"As this he utter’d, on his right hand flew"
12090,O.,"A saker, sacred to the God of view,"
12091,O.,That in his talons truss’d and plum’d a dove;
12092,O.,"The feathers round about the ship did rove,"
12093,O.,And on Telemachus fell; whom th’ augur then
12094,O.,"Took fast by the hand, withdrew him from his men,"
12095,O.,And said: “Telemachus! This hawk is sent
12096,O.,From God; I knew it for a sure ostent
12097,O.,"When first I saw it. Be you well assur’d,"
12098,O.,There will no Wooer be by heav’n endur’d
12099,O.,"To rule in Ithaca above your race,"
12100,O.,But your pow’rs ever fill the regal place.”
12101,O.,"“I wish to heav’n,” said he, “thy word might stand,"
12102,O.,Thou then shouldst soon acknowledge from my hand
12103,O.,"Such gifts and friendship, as would make thee, guest,"
12104,O.,Met and saluted as no less than blest.”
12105,O.,"This said, he call’d Piræus, Clytus’ son,"
12106,O.,"His true associate, saying: “Thou hast done"
12107,O.,(Of all my followers to the Pylian shore)
12108,O.,"My will in chief in other things, once more"
12109,O.,Be chiefly good to me; take to thy house
12110,O.,"This lovéd stranger, and be studious"
12111,O.,"T’ embrace and greet him with thy greatest fare,"
12112,O.,Till I myself come and take off thy care.”
12113,O.,The famous-for-his-lance said: “If your stay
12114,O.,"Take time for life here, this man’s care I’ll lay"
12115,O.,"On my performance, nor what fits a guest"
12116,O.,Shall any penury withhold his feast.”
12117,O.,"Thus took he ship, bade them board, and away."
12118,O.,"They boarded, sat, but did their labour stay"
12119,O.,"Till he had deck’d his feet, and reached his lance."
12120,O.,They to the city; he did straight advance
12121,O.,"Up to his styes, where swine lay for him store,"
12122,O.,"By whose side did his honest swine-herd snore,"
12123,O.,"Till his short cares his longest nights had ended,"
12124,O.,And nothing worse to both his lords intended.

12159,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
12160,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,_Πι̑._
12161,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To his most dear
12162,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ulysses shows.
12163,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The wise-son here
12164,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His father knows.
12165,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
12166,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ulysses and divine Eumæus rose
12167,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Soon as the morning could her eyes unclose,"
12168,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made fire, brake fast, and to their pasture send"
12169,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The gather’d herds, on whom their swains attend."
12170,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The self-tire barking dogs all fawn’d upon,"
12171,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor bark’d, at first sight of Ulysses’ son."
12172,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The whinings of their fawnings yet did greet
12173,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses’ ears, and sounds of certain feet,"
12174,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who thus bespake Eumæus: “Sure some friend,"
12175,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or one well-known, comes, that the mastiffs spend"
12176,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their mouths no louder. Only some one near
12177,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They whine, and leap about, whose feet I hear.”"
12178,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Each word of this speech was not spent, before"
12179,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His son stood in the entry of the door.
12180,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Out-rush’d amaz’d Eumæus, and let go"
12181,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The cup to earth, that he had labour’d so,"
12182,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cleans’d for the neat wine, did the prince-surprise,"
12183,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Kiss’d his fair forehead, both his lovely eyes,"
12184,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both his white hands, and tender tears distill’d."
12185,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,There breath’d no kind-soul’d father that was fill’d
12186,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Less with his son’s embraces, that had liv’d"
12187,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ten years in far-off earth, now new retriev’d,"
12188,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His only child too, gotten in his age,"
12189,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And for whose absence he had felt the rage
12190,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of griefs upon him, than for this divin’d"
12191,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So-much-for-form was this divine-for-mind;
12192,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who kiss’d him through, who grew about him kissing,"
12193,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As fresh from death ’scap’d. Whom so long time missing,"
12194,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He wept for joy, and said: “Thou yet art come,"
12195,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sweet light, sweet sun-rise, to thy cloudy home."
12196,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O, never I look’d, when once shipp’d away"
12197,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For Pylos’ shores, to see thy turning day."
12198,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Come, enter, lov’d son, let me feast my heart"
12199,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With thy sweet sight, new-come, so far apart."
12200,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor, when you liv’d at home, would you walk down"
12201,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Often enough here, but stay’d still at town;"
12202,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It pleas’d you then to cast such forehand view
12203,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About your house on that most damnéd crew.”[1]
12204,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“It shall be so then, friend,” said he, “but now"
12205,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I come to glad mine eyes with thee, and know"
12206,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If still my mother in her house remain,"
12207,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or if some Wooer hath aspir’d to gain
12208,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of her in nuptials; for Ulysses’ bed,"
12209,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By this, lies all with spiders’s cobwebs spread,"
12210,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In penury of him that should supply it.”
12211,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“She still,” said he, “holds her most constant quiet,"
12212,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Aloft thine own house, for the bed’s respect;"
12213,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, for her lord’s sad loss, sad nights and days"
12214,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Obscure her beauties, and corrupt their rays.”"
12215,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, Eumæus took his brazen spear,"
12216,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And in he went; when, being enter’d near"
12217,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Within the stony threshold; from his seat
12218,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His father rose to him, who would not let"
12219,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Th’ old man remove, but drew him back and prest"
12220,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With earnest terms his sitting, saying: “Guest,"
12221,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Take here your seat again, we soon shall get"
12222,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Within our own house here some other seat.
12223,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Here’s one will fetch it.” This said, down again"
12224,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His father sat, and to his son his swain"
12225,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Strew’d fair green osiers, and impos’d thereon"
12226,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A good soft sheepskin, which made him a throne."
12227,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then he appos’d to them his last-left roast,"
12228,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And in a wicker basket bread engrost,"
12229,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fill’d luscious wine, and then took opposite seat"
12230,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To the divine Ulysses. When, the meat"
12231,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Set there before them, all fell-to, and eat."
12232,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When they had fed, the prince said: “Pray thee say,"
12233,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whence comes this guest? What seaman gave him way
12234,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To this our isle? I hope these feet of his
12235,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Could walk no water. Who boasts he he is?”
12236,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“I’ll tell all truly son: From ample Crete
12237,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He boasts himself, and says, his erring feet"
12238,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Have many cities trod, and God was he"
12239,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whose finger wrought in his infirmity.
12240,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, to my cottage, the last ’scape of his"
12241,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was from a Thesprot’s ship. Whate’er he is,"
12242,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I’ll give him you, do what you please; his vaunt"
12243,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is, that he is, at most, a suppliant.”"
12244,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Eumæus,” said the prince, “to tell me this,"
12245,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,You have afflicted my weak faculties;
12246,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For how shall I receive him to my house
12247,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With any safety, that suspicious"
12248,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of my young forces (should I be assay’d
12249,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With any sudden violence) may want aid
12250,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To shield myself? Besides, if I go home,"
12251,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My mother is with two doubts overcome,"
12252,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If she shall stay with me, and take fit care"
12253,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For all such guests as there seek guestive fare,"
12254,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her husband’s bed respecting, and her fame"
12255,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amongst the people; or her blood may frame
12256,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A liking to some Wooer, such as best"
12257,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"May bed her in his house, not giving least."
12258,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And thus am I unsure of all means free
12259,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To use a guest there, fit for his degree."
12260,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, being thy guest, I’ll be his supply"
12261,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For all weeds, such as mere necessity"
12262,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall more than furnish. Fit him with a sword,"
12263,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And set him where his heart would have been shor’d;
12264,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or, if so pleas’d, receive him in thy shed,"
12265,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I’ll send thee clothes, I vow, and all the bread"
12266,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His wish would eat, that to thy men and thee"
12267,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He be no burthen. But that I should be
12268,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His mean to my house; where a company
12269,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of wrong-professing Wooers wildly live,"
12270,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I will in no sort author, lest they give"
12271,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Foul use to him, and me as gravely grieve."
12272,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For what great act can anyone achieve
12273,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against a multitude, although his mind"
12274,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Retain a courage of the greatest kind?
12275,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For all minds have not force in one degree.”
12276,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses answer’d: “O friend, since ’tis free"
12277,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For any man to change fit words with thee,"
12278,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I’ll freely speak: Methinks, a wolfish pow’r"
12279,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My heart puts on to tear and to devour,"
12280,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To hear your affirmation, that, in spite"
12281,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of what may fall on you, made opposite,"
12282,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Being one of your proportion, birth, and age,"
12283,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,These Wooers should in such injustice rage.
12284,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,What should the cause be? Do you wilfully
12285,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Endure their spoil? Or hath your empery
12286,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Been such amongst your people, that all gather"
12287,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In troop, and one voice (which ev’n God doth father)"
12288,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And vow your hate so, that they suffer them?"
12289,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or blame your kinsfolk’s faiths, before th’ extreme"
12290,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of your first stroke hath tried them, whom a man,"
12291,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When strifes to blows rise, trusts, though battle ran"
12292,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In huge and high waves? Would to heav’n my spirit
12293,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Such youth breath’d, as the man that must inherit"
12294,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet-never-touch’d Ulysses, or that he,"
12295,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But wand’ring this way, would but come, and see"
12296,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,What my age could achieve (and there is Fate
12297,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For Hope yet left, that he may recreate"
12298,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His eyes with such an object) this my head
12299,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Should any stranger strike off, if stark dead"
12300,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I struck not all, the house in open force"
12301,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ent’ring with challenge! If their great concourse
12302,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Did over-lay me, being a man alone,"
12303,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Which you urge for yourself) be you that one,"
12304,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I rather in mine own house wish to die
12305,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One death for all, than so indecently"
12306,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"See evermore deeds worse than death applied,"
12307,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Guests wrong’d with vile words and blow-giving pride,"
12308,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The women-servants dragg’d in filthy kind
12309,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About the fair house, and in corners blind"
12310,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made serve the rapes of ruffians, food devour’d"
12311,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Idly and rudely, wine exhaust, and pour’d"
12312,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Through throats profane; and all about a deed
12313,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That’s ever wooing, and will never speed.”"
12314,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“I’ll tell you, guest, most truly,” said his son,"
12315,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“I do not think that all my people run
12316,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,One hateful course against me; nor accuse
12317,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Kinsfolks that I in strifes of weight might use;
12318,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But Jove will have it so, our race alone"
12319,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(As if made singular) to one and one
12320,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His hand confining. Only to the king,"
12321,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove-bred Arcesius, did Laertes spring;"
12322,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Only to old Laertes did descend
12323,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ulysses; only to Ulysses’ end
12324,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Am I the adjunct, whom he left so young,"
12325,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That from me to him never comfort sprung.
12326,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And to all these now, for their race, arise"
12327,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Up in their house a brood of enemies.
12328,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As many as in these isles bow men’s knees,"
12329,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Samos, Dulichius, and the rich-in-trees"
12330,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Zacynthus, or in this rough isle’s command,"
12331,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So many suitors for the nuptials stand,"
12332,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That ask my mother, and, mean space, prefer"
12333,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their lusts to all spoil, that dishonour her."
12334,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor doth she, though she loaths, deny their suits,"
12335,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor they denials take, though taste their fruits."
12336,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But all this time the state of all things there
12337,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their throats devour, and I must shortly bear"
12338,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A part in all. And yet the periods
12339,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of these designs lie in the knees of Gods.
12340,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all loves then, Eumæus, make quick way"
12341,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To wise Penelopé, and to her say"
12342,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My safe return from Pylos, and alone,"
12343,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Return thou hither, having made it known."
12344,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor let, besides my mother, any ear"
12345,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Partake thy message, since a number bear"
12346,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My safe return displeasure.” He replied;
12347,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“I know, and comprehend you. You divide"
12348,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your mind with one that understands you well.
12349,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, all in one yet, may I not reveal"
12350,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To th’ old hard-fated Arcesiades
12351,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your safe return? Who, through his whole distress"
12352,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Felt for Ulysses, did not yet so grieve,"
12353,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But with his household he had will to live,"
12354,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And serv’d his appetite with wine and food,"
12355,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Survey’d his husbandry, and did his blood"
12356,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Some comforts fitting life; but since you took
12357,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your ship for Pylos, he would never brook"
12358,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or wine or food, they say, nor cast an eye"
12359,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On any labour, but sits weeping by,"
12360,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And sighing out his sorrows, ceaseless moans"
12361,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wasting his body, turn’d all skin and bones.”"
12362,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“More sad news still,” said he, “yet, mourn he still;"
12363,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For if the rule of all men’s works be will,"
12364,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And his will his way goes, mine stands inclin’d"
12365,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,T’ attend the home-turn of my nearer kind.[2]
12366,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Do then what I enjoin; which giv’n effect,"
12367,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Err nor to field to him, but turn direct,"
12368,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Entreating first my mother, with most speed,"
12369,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all the secrecy that now serves need,"
12370,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To send this way their store-house guardian,"
12371,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And she shall tell all to the aged man.”[3]
12372,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He took his shoes up, put them on, and went."
12373,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor was his absence hid from Jove’s descent,"
12374,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Divine Minerva, who took straight to view,"
12375,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A goodly woman’s shape that all works knew,"
12376,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, standing in the entry, did prefer"
12377,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her sight t’ Ulysses; but, though meeting her,"
12378,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His son Telemachus nor saw nor knew.
12379,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,_The Gods’ clear presences are known to few._
12380,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet, with Ulysses, ev’n the dogs did see,"
12381,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And would not bark, but, whining lovingly,"
12382,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Fled to the stall’s far side. When she her eyne
12383,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mov’d to Ulysses; he knew her design,"
12384,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And left the house, pass’d the great sheep-cote’s wall,"
12385,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And stood before her. She bade utter all
12386,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now to his son, nor keep the least unlos’d,"
12387,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, all the Wooers’ deaths being now dispos’d,"
12388,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They might approach the town; affirming; she
12389,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Not long would fail t’ assist to victory.
12390,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, she laid her golden rod on him,"
12391,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And with his late-worn weeds grac’d ev’ry limb,"
12392,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His body straighten’d, and his youth instill’d,"
12393,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His fresh blood call’d up, ev’ry wrinkle fill’d"
12394,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About his broken eyes, and on his chin"
12395,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The brown hair spread. When his whole trim wrought in,"
12396,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She issued, and he enter’d to his son,"
12397,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who stood amaz’d, and thought some God had done"
12398,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His house that honour, turn’d away his eyes,"
12399,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said; “Now guest, you grace another guise"
12400,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Than suits your late show. Other weeds you wear,"
12401,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And other person. Of the starry sphere
12402,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,You certainly present some deathless God.
12403,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Be pleas’d, that to your here-vouchsaf’d abode"
12404,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We may give sacred rites, and offer gold,"
12405,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To do us favour.” He replied; “I hold
12406,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,No deified state. Why put you thus on me
12407,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A God’s resemblance? I am only he
12408,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That bears thy father’s name; for whose lov’d sake
12409,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy youth so grieves, whose absence makes thee take"
12410,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Such wrongs of men.” Thus kiss’d he him, nor could"
12411,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Forbear those tears that in such mighty hold
12412,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He held before, still held, still issuing ever;"
12413,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And now, the shores once broke, the springtide never"
12414,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Forbore earth from the cheeks he kiss’d. His son,"
12415,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By all these violent arguments not won
12416,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To credit him his father, did deny"
12417,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His kind assumpt, and said, some Deity"
12418,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Feign’d that joy’s cause, to make him grieve the more;"
12419,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Affirming, that no man, whoever wore"
12420,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The garment of mortality, could take,"
12421,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By any utmost pow’r his soul could make,"
12422,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Such change into it, since, at so much will,"
12423,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Not Jove himself could both remove and fill
12424,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Old age with youth, and youth with age so spoil,"
12425,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In such an instant. “You wore all the soil
12426,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of age but now, and were old; and but now"
12427,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,You bear that young grace that the Gods indow
12428,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their heav’n-born forms withal.” His father said:
12429,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Telemachus! Admire, nor stand dismay’d,"
12430,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But know thy solid father; since within
12431,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He answers all parts that adorn his skin.
12432,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,There shall no more Ulyssesses come here.
12433,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I am the man, that now this twentieth year"
12434,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Still under suff’rance of a world of ill)
12435,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My country-earth recover. ’Tis the will
12436,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The prey-professor Pallas puts in act,"
12437,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who put me thus together, thus distract"
12438,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In aged pieces as ev’n now you saw,"
12439,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This youth now rend’ring. ’Tis within the law
12440,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of her free pow’r. Sometimes to show me poor,"
12441,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Sometimes again thus amply to restore
12442,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My youth and ornaments, she still would please."
12443,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"_The Gods can raise, and throw men down, with ease.”_"
12444,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he sat; when his Telemachus pour’d"
12445,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Himself about him; tears on tears he show’r’d,"
12446,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And to desire of moan increas’d the cloud.
12447,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both wept and howl’d, and laid out shrieks more loud"
12448,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Than or the bird-bone-breaking eagle rears,"
12449,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or brood-kind vulture with the crooked seres,"
12450,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When rustic hands their tender eyries draw,"
12451,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Before they give their wings their full-plum’d law.
12452,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But miserably pour’d they from beneath
12453,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their lids their tears, while both their breasts did breathe"
12454,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As frequent cries; and, to their fervent moan,"
12455,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The light had left the skies, if first the son"
12456,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their dumb moans had not vented, with demand"
12457,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,What ship it was that gave the natural land
12458,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To his bless’d feet? He then did likewise lay
12459,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hand on his passion, and gave these words way:"
12460,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“I’ll tell thee truth, my son: The men that bear"
12461,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Much fame for shipping, my reducers were"
12462,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To long-wish’d Ithaca, who each man else"
12463,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That greets their shore give pass to where he dwells.
12464,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Phæacensian peers, in one night’s date,"
12465,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"While I fast slept, fetch’d th’ Ithacensian state,"
12466,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Grac’d me with wealthy gifts, brass, store of gold,"
12467,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And robes fair-wrought; all which have secret hold
12468,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In caves that by the Gods’ advice I chus’d.
12469,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And now Minerva’s admonitions us’d
12470,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For this retreat, that we might here dispose"
12471,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In close discourse the slaughters of our foes.
12472,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Recount the number of the Wooers then,"
12473,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And let me know what name they hold with men,"
12474,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That my mind may cast over their estates
12475,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A curious measure, and confer the rates"
12476,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of our two pow’rs and theirs, to try, if we"
12477,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Alone may propagate to victory
12478,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our bold encounters of them all, or prove"
12479,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The kind assistance of some others’ love.”
12480,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O father,” he replied, “I oft have heard"
12481,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your counsels and your force of hand preferr’d
12482,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To mighty glory, but your speeches now"
12483,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your vent’rous mind exceeding mighty show.
12484,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n to amaze they move me; for, in right"
12485,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of no fit counsel, should be brought to fight"
12486,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Two men ’gainst th’ able faction of a throng.
12487,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No one two, no one ten, no twice ten, strong"
12488,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These Wooers are, but more by much. For know,"
12489,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That from Dulichius there are fifty-two,"
12490,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All choice young men; and ev’ry one of these
12491,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Six men attend. From Samos cross’d the seas
12492,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Twice-twelve young gallants. From Zacynthus came
12493,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Twice-ten. Of Ithaca, the best of name,"
12494,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Twice-six. Of all which all the state they take
12495,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A sacred poet and a herald make.
12496,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their delicacies two, of special sort"
12497,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In skill of banquets, serve. And all this port"
12498,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If we shall dare t’ encounter, all-thrust-up"
12499,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In one strong roof, have great care lest the cup,"
12500,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your great mind thirsts, exceeding bitter taste,"
12501,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And your retreat commend not to your haste
12502,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your great attempt, but make you say, you buy"
12503,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their pride’s revenges at a price too high.
12504,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore, if you could; ’twere well you thought"
12505,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of some assistant. Be your spirit wrought
12506,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In such a man’s election, as may lend"
12507,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His succours freely, and express a friend.”"
12508,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His father answer’d: “Let me ask of thee;
12509,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hear me, consider, and then answer me."
12510,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Think’st thou, if Pallas and the King of skies"
12511,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We had to friend, would their sufficiencies"
12512,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Make strong our part? Or that some other yet
12513,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My thoughts must work for?” “These,” said he “are set"
12514,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Aloft the clouds, and are found aids indeed,"
12515,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As pow’rs not only that these men exceed,"
12516,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But bear of all men else the high command,"
12517,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And hold of Gods an overruling hand.”
12518,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Well then,” said he, “not these shall sever long"
12519,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their force and ours in fights assur’d and strong.
12520,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And then ’twixt us and them shall Mars prefer
12521,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His strength, to stand our great distinguisher,"
12522,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When in mine own roofs I am forc’d to blows.
12523,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But when the day shall first her fires disclose,"
12524,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Go thou for home, and troop up with the Wooers,"
12525,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy will with theirs join’d, pow’r with their rude pow’rs;"
12526,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And after shall the herdsman guide to town
12527,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My steps, my person wholly overgrown"
12528,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all appearance of a poor old swain,"
12529,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Heavy, and wretched. If their high disdain"
12530,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of my vile presence make them my desert
12531,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Affect with contumelies, let thy lov’d heart"
12532,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beat in fix’d cónfines of thy bosom still,"
12533,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And see me suffer, patient of their ill."
12534,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ay, though they drag me by the heels about"
12535,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mine own free earth, and after hurl me out,"
12536,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Do thou still suffer. Nay, though with their darts"
12537,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They beat and bruise me, bear. But these foul parts"
12538,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Persuade them to forbear, and by their names"
12539,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Call all with kind words; bidding, for their shames,"
12540,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their pleasures cease. If yet they yield not way,"
12541,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,There breaks the first light of their fatal day.
12542,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In mean space, mark this: When the chiefly-wise"
12543,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Minerva prompts me, I’ll inform thine eyes"
12544,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With some giv’n sign, and then all th’ arms that are"
12545,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Aloft thy roof in some near room prepare
12546,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For speediest use. If those brave men inquire
12547,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy end in all, still rake up all thy fire"
12548,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In fair cool words, and say: ‘I bring them down"
12549,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To scour the smoke off, being so overgrown"
12550,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That one would think all fumes, that ever were"
12551,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Breath’d since Ulysses’ loss, reflected here."
12552,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These are not like the arms he left behind,"
12553,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In way for Troy. Besides, Jove prompts my mind"
12554,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In their remove apart thus with this thought,"
12555,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, if in height of wine there should be wrought,"
12556,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some harsh contention ’twixt you, this apt mean"
12557,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To mutual bloodshed may be taken clean
12558,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From out your reach, and all the spoil prevented"
12559,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of present feast, perhaps ev’n then presented"
12560,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My mother’s nuptials to your long kind vows.
12561,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"_Steel itself, ready, draws a man to blows.’_"
12562,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus make their thoughts secure; to us alone
12563,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Two swords, two darts, two shields left: which see done"
12564,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Within our readiest reach, that at our will"
12565,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We may resume, and charge, and all their skill"
12566,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pallas and Jove, that all just counsels breathe,"
12567,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,May darken with secureness to their death.
12568,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And let me charge thee now, as thou art mine,"
12569,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And as thy veins mine own true blood combine:
12570,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let, after this, none know Ulysses near,"
12571,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not anyone of all the household there,"
12572,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not here the herdsman, not Laertes be"
12573,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made privy, not herself Penelopé"
12574,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But only let thyself and me work out
12575,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The women’s thoughts of all things borne about
12576,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Wooers’ hearts; and then thy men approve,"
12577,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To know who honours, who with rev’rence love,"
12578,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our well-weigh’d memories, and who is won"
12579,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To fail thy fit right, though my only son.”"
12580,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“You teach,” said he, “so punctually now,"
12581,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As I knew nothing, nor were sprung from you."
12582,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I hope, hereafter, you shall better know"
12583,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What soul I bear, and that it doth not let"
12584,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The least loose motion pass his natural seat.
12585,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But this course you propose will prove, I fear,"
12586,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Small profit to us; and could wish your care
12587,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Would weigh it better as too far about.
12588,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For time will ask much, to the sifting out"
12589,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of each man’s disposition by his deeds;
12590,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, in the mean time, ev’ry Wooer feeds"
12591,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beyond satiety, nor knows how to spare."
12592,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The women yet, since they more easy are"
12593,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For our inquiry, I would wish you try,"
12594,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who right your state, who do it injury."
12595,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The men I would omit, and these things make"
12596,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your labour after. But, to undertake"
12597,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Wooers’ war, I wish your utmost speed,"
12598,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Especially if you could cheer the deed
12599,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With some ostent from Jove.” Thus, as the sire"
12600,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Consented to the son, did here expire"
12601,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their mutual speech. And now the ship was come,"
12602,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That brought the young prince and his soldiers home,"
12603,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The deep haven reach’d, they drew the ship ashore,"
12604,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Took all their arms out, and the rich gifts bore"
12605,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To Clitius’ house. But to Ulysses’ court
12606,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They sent a herald first, to make report"
12607,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To wise Penelopé, that safe at field"
12608,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her son was left; yet, since the ship would yield"
12609,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Most haste to her, he sent that first, and them"
12610,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To comfort with his utmost the extreme
12611,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He knew she suffer’d. At the court now met
12612,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The herald and the herdsman, to repeat"
12613,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,One message to the queen. Both whom arriv’d
12614,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Within the gates; both to be foremost striv’d
12615,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In that good news. The herald, he for haste"
12616,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the maids bestow’d it, thinking plac’d"
12617,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The queen amongst them. “Now,” said he, “O queen,"
12618,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your lov’d son is arriv’d.” And, then was seen"
12619,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The queen herself, to whom the herdsman told"
12620,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All that Telemachus enjoin’d he should;
12621,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All which discharg’d, his steps he back bestows,"
12622,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And left both court and city for his sows.
12623,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Wooers then grew sad; soul-vex’d, and all"
12624,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made forth the court; when, by the mighty wall"
12625,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They took their sev’ral seats, before the gates."
12626,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To whom Eurymachus initiates.
12627,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their utter’d grievance. “O,” said he, “my friends,"
12628,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A work right-great begun, as proudly ends,"
12629,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We said, Telemachus should never make"
12630,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His voyage good, nor this shore ever take"
12631,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For his return’s receipt; and yet we fail,"
12632,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And he performs it. Come, let’s man a sail,"
12633,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The best In our election, and bestow"
12634,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Such soldiers in her as can swiftest row,"
12635,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To tell our friends that way-lay his retreat
12636,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘Tis safe perform’d, and make them quickly get"
12637,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their ship for Ithaca.” This was not said
12638,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Before Amphinomus in port display’d
12639,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The ship arriv’d, her sails then under-stroke,"
12640,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And oars resum’d; when, laughing, thus he spoke:"
12641,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Move for no messenger. These men are come,"
12642,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some God hath either told his turning home,"
12643,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or they themselves have seen his ship gone by,"
12644,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had her in chase, and lost her.” Instantly"
12645,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They rose, and went to port; found drawn to land"
12646,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The ship, the soldiers taking arms in hand."
12647,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Wooers themselves to council went in throng,"
12648,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And not a man besides, or old, or young,"
12649,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let sit amongst them. Then Eupitheus’ son,"
12650,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Antinous, said: “See, what the Gods have done!"
12651,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They only have deliver’d from our ill
12652,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The men we way-laid. Ev’ry windy hill
12653,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hath been their watch-tow’r, where by turns they stood"
12654,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Continual sentinel. And we made good
12655,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our work as well, for, sun once set, we never"
12656,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Slept wink ashore all night, but made sail ever,"
12657,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This way and that, ev’n till the morning kept"
12658,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her sacred station, so to intercept"
12659,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And take his life, for whom our ambush lay;"
12660,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And yet hath God to his return giv’n way.
12661,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But let us prosecute with counsels here
12662,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His necessary death, nor anywhere"
12663,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let rest his safety; for if he survive,"
12664,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our sails will never in wish’d havens arrive;
12665,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since he is wise, hath soul, and counsel too,"
12666,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To work the people, who, will never do"
12667,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our faction favour. What we then intend
12668,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against his person, give we present end,"
12669,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before he call a council, which, believe,"
12670,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His spirit will haste, and point where it doth grieve,"
12671,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stand up amongst them all, and urge his death"
12672,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Decreed amongst us. Which complaint will breathe
12673,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A fire about their spleens, and blow no praise"
12674,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On our ill labours. Lest, they therefore raise"
12675,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pow’r to exile us from our native earth,"
12676,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And force our lives’ societies to the birth
12677,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of foreign countries, let our speeds prevent,"
12678,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His coming home to this austere complaint,"
12679,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At field and far from town, or in some way"
12680,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of narrow passage, with his latest day"
12681,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shown to his forward youth, his goods and lands"
12682,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Left to the free division of our hands,"
12683,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The moveables made all his mother’s dow’r,"
12684,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And his, whoever Fate affords the pow’r"
12685,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To celebrate, with her sweet Hymen’s rites."
12686,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or if this please not, but your appetites"
12687,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stand to his safety, and to give him seat"
12688,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his whole birth-right, let us look to eat"
12689,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At his cost never more, but ev’ry man"
12690,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Haste to his home, and wed, with whom he can"
12691,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At home, and there lay first about for dow’r"
12692,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And then the woman give his second pow’r
12693,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of nuptial-liking, and, for last, apply"
12694,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His purpose with most gifts and destiny.”
12695,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This silence caus’d; whose breach, at last, begun"
12696,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amphinomus, the much renownéd son"
12697,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Nisus surnam’d Aretiades,"
12698,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Who from Dulichius full of flow’ry leas
12699,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Led all the Wooers, and in chief did please"
12700,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The queen with his discourse, because it grew"
12701,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From roots of those good minds that did endue[4]
12702,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His goodly person; who, exceeding wise,"
12703,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Us’d this speech: “Friends, I never will advise"
12704,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The prince’s death; for ’tis a damnéd thing
12705,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To put to death the issue of a king.
12706,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"First, therefore, let’s examine, what applause"
12707,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Gods will give it: If the equal laws
12708,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Jove approve it, I myself will be"
12709,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The man shall kill him, and this company"
12710,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Exhort to that mind: If the Gods remain
12711,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Adverse, and hate it, I advise, refrain.”"
12712,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said Amphinomus, and pleas’d them all"
12713,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When all arose, and in Ulysses’ hall"
12714,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Took seat again. Then to the queen was come
12715,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Wooers’ plot, to kill her son at home,"
12716,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since their abroad-design had miss’d success,"
12717,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The herald Medon (who the whole address
12718,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Knew of their counsels) making the report.
12719,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Goddess of her sex, with her fair sort"
12720,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of lovely women, at the large hall’s door"
12721,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Her bright cheeks clouded with a veil she wore)
12722,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stood, and directed to Antinous"
12723,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her sharp reproof, which she digested thus:"
12724,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“Antinous! Compos’d of injury!
12725,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Plotter of mischief! Though reports that fly
12726,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amongst our Ithacensian people say
12727,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That thou, of all that glory in their sway,"
12728,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Art best in words and counsels, th’ art not so."
12729,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fond, busy fellow, why plott’st thou the woe"
12730,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And slaughter of my son, and dost not fear"
12731,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The presidents of suppliants, when the ear"
12732,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of Jove stoops to them? ’Tis unjust to do
12733,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Slaughter for slaughter, or pay woe for woe,"
12734,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mischief for kindness. Death for life sought, then,"
12735,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Is an injustice to be loath’d of men.
12736,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Serves not thy knowledge to remember when
12737,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy father fled to us? Who (mov’d to wrath
12738,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Against the Taphian thieves) pursued with scathe
12739,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The guiltless Thesprots; in whose people’s fear,"
12740,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pursuing him for wreak, he landed here,"
12741,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They after him, professing both their prize"
12742,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all his chiefly-valued faculties,"
12743,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And more priz’d life. Of all whose bloodiest ends
12744,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses curb’d them, though they were his friends."
12745,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet thou, like one that no law will allow"
12746,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The least true honour, eat’st his house up now"
12747,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That fed thy father; woo’st for love his wife,"
12748,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whom thus thou griev’st and seek’st her sole son’s life!
12749,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cease, I command thee, and command the rest"
12750,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To see all thought of these foul fashions ceas’d.”
12751,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eurymachus replied: “Be confident,"
12752,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou all-of-wit-made, the most fam’d descent"
12753,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of king Icarius. Free thy spirits of fear.

12755,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now, nor hereafter, while my life gives heat"
12756,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And light to me on earth, that dares intreat"

12758,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But here I vow, and here will see it done,"
12759,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His life shall stain my lance. If on his knees
12760,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The city-racer, Laertiades,"
12761,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hath made me sit, put in my hand his food,"
12762,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And held his red wine to me, shall the blood"
12763,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of his Telemachus on my hand lay
12764,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The least pollution, that my life can stay?"
12765,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,No! I have ever charg’d him not to fear
12766,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Death’s threat from any. And, for that most dear"
12767,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Love of his father, he shall ever be"
12768,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Much the most lov’d of all that live to me.
12769,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"_Who kills a guiltless man from man may fly,"
12770,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From God his searches all escapes deny.”_
12771,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus cheer’d his words, but his affections still"
12772,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Fear’d not to cherish foul intent to kill
12773,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ev’n him whose life to all lives he preferr’d.
12774,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The queen went up, and to her love appear’d"
12775,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her lord so freshly, that she wept, till sleep"
12776,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(By Pallas forc’d on her) her eyes did steep
12777,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his sweet humour. When the even was come,"

12786,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In these deep secrets being not deeply seen.
12787,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He seen, to him the prince these words did use:"
12788,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“Welcome divine Eumæus! Now what news
12789,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Employs the city? Are the Wooers come
12790,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Back from their scout dismay’d? Or here at home
12791,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Will they again attempt me?” He replied:
12792,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“These touch not my care. I was satisfied
12793,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To do, with most speed, what I went to do;"
12794,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My message done, return. And yet, not so"
12795,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Came my news first; a herald (met with there)
12796,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Forestall’d my tale, and told how safe you were."
12797,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Besides which merely necessary thing,"

12854,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But when air’s rosy birth, the morn, arose,"
12855,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Telemachus did for the town dispose
12856,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His early steps; and took to his command
12857,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His fair long lance, well-sorting with his hand,"
12858,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus parting with Eumæus: “Now, my friend,"
12859,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I must to town, lest too far I extend"
12860,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My mother’s moan for me, who, till her eyes"
12861,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mine own eyes witness, varies tears and cries"
12862,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Through all extremes. Do then this charge of mine,"
12863,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And guide to town this hapless guest of thine,"
12864,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To beg elsewhere his further festival.
12865,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Give they that please, I cannot give to all,"
12866,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Mine own wants take up for myself my pain.

12870,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Desire at all your further charity.
12871,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘Tis better beg in cities than in fields,"
12872,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And take the worst a beggar’s fortune yields.
12873,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor am I apt to stay in swine-styes more,"
12874,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,However; ever the great chief before
12875,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The poor ranks must to ev’ry step obey.

12885,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, his son went on with spritely pace,"
12886,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And to the Wooers studied little grace.
12887,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Arriv’d at home, he gave his jav’lin stay"
12888,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against a lofty pillar, and bold way"
12889,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Made further in. When having so far gone
12890,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That he transcended the fair porch of stone,"
12891,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The first by far that gave his entry eye
12892,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was nurse Euryclea; who th’ embrodery
12893,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of stools there set was giving cushions fair;
12894,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who ran upon him, and her rapt repair"
12895,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Shed tears for joy. About him gather’d round
12896,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The other maids; his head and shoulders crown’d
12897,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With kisses and embraces. From above
12898,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Queen herself came, like the Queen of Love,"
12899,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or bright Diana; cast about her son
12900,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her kind embraces, with effusión"

12902,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His cheeks, and forehead; and gave all supplies"
12903,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With this entreaty; “Welcome, sweetest light!"
12904,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I never had conceit to set quick sight
12905,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On thee thus soon, when thy lov’d father’s fame"
12906,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As far as Pylos did thy spirit inflame,"
12907,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In that search ventur’d all-unknown to me.
12908,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O say, by what pow’r cam’st thou now to be"
12909,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Mine eyes’ dear object?” He return’d reply:
12910,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Move me not now, when you my ’scape descry"

12912,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fear’d wound rubbing, felt before I ’scapt."

12915,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But pure weeds putting on, ascend and take"
12916,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your women with you, that ye all may make"
12917,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Vows of full hecatombs in sacred fire
12918,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all the Godheads, if their only Sire"
12919,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Vouchsafe revenge of guest-rites wrong’d, which he"
12920,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Is to protect as being their Deity.
12921,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My way shall be directed to the hall
12922,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of common concourse, that I thence may call"
12923,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A stranger, who from off the Pylian shore"
12924,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Came friendly with me; whom I sent before
12925,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all my soldiers, but in chief did charge"
12926,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Piræus with him, wishing him t’ enlarge"
12927,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His love to him at home, in best affair,"
12928,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And utmost honours, till mine own repair.”"
12929,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her son thus spoken, his words could not bear"
12930,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The wings too easily through her either ear,"
12931,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But putting pure weeds on, made vows entire"
12932,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of perfect hecatombs in sacred fire
12933,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all the Deities, if their only Sire"
12934,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Vouchsaf’d revenge of guest-rites wrong’d, which he"
12935,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was to protect as being their Deity.
12936,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her son left house, in his fair hand his lance,"
12937,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His dogs attending; and, on ev’ry glance"
12938,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His looks cast from them, Pallas put a grace"
12939,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That made him seem of the celestial race.
12940,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom, come to concourse, ev’ry man admir’d,"
12941,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About him throng’d the Wooers, and desir’d"
12942,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All good to him in tongues, but in their hearts"
12943,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Most deep ills threaten’d to his most deserts.
12944,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of whose huge rout once free, he cast glad eye"
12945,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On some that, long before his infancy,"
12946,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were with his father great and gracious,"
12947,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Grave Halitherses, Mentor, Antiphus:"
12948,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To whom he went, took seat by them, and they"
12949,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Inquir’d of all things since his parting day.
12950,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To them Piræus came, and brought his guest"
12951,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Along the city thither, whom not least"
12952,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The prince respected, nor was long before"
12953,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He rose and met him. The first word yet bore
12954,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Piræus from them both; whose haste besought
12955,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The prince to send his women to see brought
12956,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The gifts from his house that Atrides gave,"
12957,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which his own roofs, he thought, would better save."
12958,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The wise prince answer’d: “I can scarce conceive
12959,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The way to these works. If the Wooers reave
12960,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By privy stratagem my life at home,"
12961,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I rather wish Piræus may become
12962,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The master of them, than the best of these."
12963,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, if I sow in their fields of excess"
12964,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Slaughter and ruin, then thy trust employ,"
12965,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And to me joying bring thou those with joy.”
12966,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he brought home his grief-practis’d guest;"
12967,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where both put off, both oil’d, and did invest"
12968,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Themselves in rich robes, wash’d, and sate, and eat."
12969,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His mother, in a fair chair taking seat"
12970,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Directly opposite, her loom applied;"
12971,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who, when her son and guest had satisfied"
12972,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their appetites with feast, said: “O my son,"
12973,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,You know that ever since your sire was won
12974,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To go in Agamemnon’s guide to Troy,"
12975,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Attempting sleep, I never did enjoy"
12976,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One night’s good rest, but made my quiet bed"
12977,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A sea blown-up with sighs, with tears still shed"
12978,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Embrew’d and troubled; yet, though all your miss"
12979,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In your late voyage hath been made for this,"
12980,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That you might know th’ abode your father made.
12981,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,You shun to tell me what success you had.
12982,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now then, before the insolent access"
12983,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Wooers straight will force on us, express"
12984,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What you have heard.” “I will,” said he, “and true."
12985,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We came to Pylos, where the studious due"
12986,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That any father could afford his son,"
12987,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(But new-arriv’d from some course he had run
12988,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To an extreme length, in some voyage vow’d),"
12989,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nestor, the pastor of the people, show’d"
12990,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To me arriv’d, in turrets thrust-up high,"
12991,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Where not his brave sons were more lov’d than I.
12992,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Yet of th’ unconquer’d ever-sufferer;
12993,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, never he could set his ear,"
12994,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Alive or dead, from any earthy man."
12995,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But to the great Lacedæmonian,"
12996,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Atrides, famous for his lance, he sent,"
12997,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With horse and chariots, me, to learn th’ event"
12998,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From his relation; where I had the view
12999,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Argive Helen, whose strong beauties drew,"
13000,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By wills of Gods, so many Grecian states,"
13001,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Trojans, under such laborious fates."
13002,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where Menelaus ask’d me, what affair"
13003,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To Lacedæmon render’d my repair.
13004,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I told him all the truth, who made reply:"
13005,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,‘O deed of most abhorr’d indecency!
13006,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A sort of impotents attempt his bed
13007,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whose strength of mind hath cities levelléd!

13010,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When he is ranging hills, and herby dales,"
13011,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To make of feeders there his festivals,"
13012,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, turning to his luster, calves and dam"
13013,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He shows abhorr’d death, in his anger’s flame;"
13014,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So, should Ulysses find this rabble hous’d"
13015,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his free turrets, courting his espous’d,"
13016,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Foul death would fall them. O, I would to Jove,"
13017,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Phœbus, and Pallas, that, when he shall prove"
13018,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The broad report of his exhausted store
13019,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"True with his eyes, his nerves and sinews wore"
13020,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That vigour then that in the Lesbian tow’rs,"
13021,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Provok’d to wrastle with the iron pow’rs
13022,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Philomelides vaunted, he approv’d;"
13023,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When down he hurl’d his challenger, and mov’d"
13024,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Huge shouts from all the Achives then in view.
13025,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If, once come home, he all those forces drew"
13026,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About him there to work, they all were dead,"
13027,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And should find bitter his attempted bed.
13028,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But what you ask and sue for, I, as far"
13029,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As I have heard the true-spoke mariner,"
13030,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will tell directly, nor delude your ear:"
13031,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He told me that an island did ensphere,"
13032,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In much discomfort, great Laertes’ son;"
13033,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And that the Nymph Calypso, overrun"
13034,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With his affection, kept him in her caves,"
13035,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where men, nor ship, of pow’r to brook the waves,"
13036,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were near his convoy to his country’s shore,"
13037,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And where herself importun’d evermore
13038,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His quiet stay; which not obtain’d, by force"
13039,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,She kept his person from all else recourse.’
13040,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This told Atrides, which was all he knew."
13041,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor stay’d I more, but from the Gods there blew"
13042,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A prosp’rous wind, that set me quickly here.”"
13043,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This put his mother quite from all her cheer.
13044,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When Theoclymenus the augur said:
13045,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O woman, honour’d with Ulysses’ bed,"
13046,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your son, no doubt, knows clearly nothing more,"
13047,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hear me yet speak, that can the truth uncore,"
13048,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor will be curious. Jove then witness bear,"
13049,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And this thy hospitable table here,"
13050,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With this whole household of your blameless lord,"
13051,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That at this hour his royal feet are shor’d
13052,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On his lov’d country-earth, and that ev’n here"
13053,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Coming, or creeping, he will see the cheer"
13054,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These Wooers make, and in his soul’s field sow"
13055,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Seeds that shall thrive to all their overthrow.
13056,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This, set a ship-board, I knew sorted thus,"
13057,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And cried it out to your Telemachus.”
13058,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Penelopé replied: “Would this would prove,"
13059,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You well should witness a most friendly love,"
13060,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And gifts such of me, as encount’ring Fame"
13061,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Should greet you with a blesséd mortal’s name.”
13062,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This mutual speech past, all the Wooers were"
13063,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hurling the stone, and tossing of the spear,"
13064,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before the palace, in the pavéd court,"
13065,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Where otherwhiles their petulant resort
13066,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Sat plotting injuries. But when the hour
13067,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of supper enter’d, and the feeding pow’r"
13068,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Brought sheep from field, that fill’d up ev’ry way"
13069,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With those that us’d to furnish that purvey,"
13070,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Medon, the herald (who of all the rest"
13071,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pleas’d most the Wooers, and at ev’ry feast"
13072,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was ever near) said: “You whose kind consort
13073,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Make the fair branches of the tree our court,"
13074,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Grace it within now, and your suppers take."
13075,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You that for health, and fair contention’s sake,"
13076,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will please your minds, know, bodies must have meat;"
13077,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,_Play’s worse than idleness in times to eat.”_
13078,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, all left, came in, cast by, on thrones"
13079,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And chairs, their garments. Their provisións"
13080,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were sheep, swine, goats, the chiefly-great and fat,"
13081,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Besides an ox that from the herd they gat.
13082,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And now the king and herdsman, from the field,"
13083,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In good way were to town; ’twixt whom was held
13084,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some walking conference, which thus begun"
13085,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The good Eumæus: “Guest, your will was won,"
13086,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Because the prince commanded, to make way"
13087,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up to the city, though I wish’d your stay,"
13088,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And to have made you guardian of my stall;
13089,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But I, in care and fear of what might fall"
13090,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In after-anger of the prince, forbore."
13091,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,_The checks of princes touch their subjects sore._
13092,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But make we haste, the day is nearly ended,"
13093,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And cold airs still are in the even extended.”
13094,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“I know’t,” said he, “consider all; your charge"
13095,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Is giv’n to one that understands at large.
13096,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Haste then. Hereafter, you shall lead the way;"
13097,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Afford your staff too, if it fit your stay,"
13098,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That I may use it; since you say our pass
13099,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Is less friend to a weak foot than it was.”
13100,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus cast he on his neck his nasty scrip,"
13101,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All-patch’d and torn; a cord, that would not slip"
13102,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For knots and bracks about the mouth of it,"
13103,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Made serve the turn; and then his swain did fit
13104,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His forc’d state with a staff. Then plied they hard
13105,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their way to town, their cottage left in guard"
13106,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To swains and dogs. And now Eumæus led
13107,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The king along, his garments to a thread"
13108,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All-bare and burn’d, and he himself hard bore"
13109,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon his staff, at all parts like a poor"
13110,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And sad old beggar. But when now they got
13111,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The rough highway, their voyage wanted not"
13112,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Much of the city, where a fount they reach’d,"
13113,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From whence the town their choicest water fetch’d,"
13114,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That ever overflow’d, and curious art"
13115,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was shown about it; in which three had part
13116,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose names Neritus and Polyctor were,"
13117,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And famous Ithacus. It had a sphere
13118,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of poplar, that ran round about the wall;"
13119,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And into it a lofty rock let fall
13120,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Continual supply of cool clear stream.
13121,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On whose top, to the Nymphs that were supreme"
13122,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In those parts’ loves, a stately altar rose,"
13123,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Where ev’ry traveller did still impose
13124,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Devoted sacrifice. At this fount found
13125,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,These silly travellers a man renown’d
13126,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For guard of goats, which now he had in guide,"
13127,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose huge-stor’d herd two herdsmen kept beside,"
13128,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For all herds it excell’d, and bred a feed"
13129,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For Wooers only. He was Dolius’ seed,"
13130,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And call’d Melanthius. Who casting eye
13131,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On these two there, he chid them terribly,"
13132,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And so past mean, that ev’n the wretched fate"
13133,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Now on Ulysses he did irritate.
13134,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His fume to this effect he did pursue:
13135,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Why so,’tis now at all parts passing true,"
13136,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That ill leads ill, good evermore doth train"
13137,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With like his like. Why, thou unenvied swain,"
13138,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whither dost thou lead this same victless leaguer,"
13139,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This bane of banquets, this most nasty beggar,"
13140,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose sight doth make one sad, it so abhors?"
13141,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who, with his standing in so many doors,"
13142,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Hath broke his back; and all his beggary tends
13143,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To beg base crusts, but to no manly ends,"
13144,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As asking swords, or with activity"
13145,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To get a caldron. Wouldst thou give him me,"
13146,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To farm my stable, or to sweep my yard,"
13147,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And bring browse to my kids, and that preferr’d"
13148,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He should be at my keeping for his pains
13149,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To drink as much whey as his thirsty veins
13150,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Would still be swilling (whey made all his fees)
13151,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His monstrous belly would oppress his knees.
13152,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But he hath learn’d to lead base life about,"
13153,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And will not work, but crouch among the rout"
13154,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For broken meat to cram his bursten gut.
13155,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet this I’ll say, and he will find it put"
13156,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In sure effect, that if he enters where"
13157,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses’ roofs cast shade, the stools will there"
13158,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About his ears fly, all the house will throw,"
13159,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And rub his ragged sides with cuffs enow.”
13160,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Past these reviles, his manless rudeness spurn’d"
13161,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Divine Ulysses; who at no part turn’d
13162,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His face from him, but had his spirit fed"
13163,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With these two thoughts, if he should strike him dead"
13164,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With his bestowéd staff, or at his feet"
13165,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Make his direct head and the pavement meet.
13166,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But he bore all, and entertain’d a breast"
13167,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That in the strife of all extremes did rest.
13168,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eumæus, frowning on him, chid him yet,"
13169,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, lifting up his hands to heav’n, he set"
13170,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This bitter curse at him: “O you that bear
13171,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fair name to be the race of Jupiter,"
13172,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nymphs of these fountains! If Ulysses ever
13173,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Burn’d thighs to you, that, hid in fat, did never"
13174,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fail your acceptance, of or lamb or kid,"
13175,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Grant this grace to me: Let the man thus hid
13176,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shine through his dark fate, make some God his guide,"
13177,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, to thee, goatherd, this same palate’s pride,[1]"
13178,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou driv’st afore thee, he may come and make"
13179,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The scatt’rings of the earth, and overtake"
13180,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy wrongs, with forcing thee to ever err"
13181,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About the city, hunted by his fear."
13182,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And in the mean space by some slothful swains
13183,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Let lousy sickness gnaw thy cattle’s veins.”
13184,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O Gods!” replied Melanthius, “what a curse"
13185,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hath this dog bark’d out, and can yet do worse!"
13186,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This man shall I have giv’n into my hands,"
13187,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When in a well-built ship to far-off lands
13188,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I shall transport him, that, should I want here,"
13189,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My sale of him may find me victuals there.
13190,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, for Ulysses, would to heav’n his joy"
13191,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The silver-bearing-bow God would destroy,"
13192,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This day, within his house, as sure as he"
13193,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The day of his return shall never see.”
13194,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he left them going silent on;"
13195,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But he out-went them, and took straight upon"
13196,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The palace-royal, which he enter’d straight,"
13197,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sat with the Wooers, and his trencher’s freight"
13198,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The carvers gave him of the flesh there vented,"
13199,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But bread the rev’rend butleress presented.
13200,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He took against Eurymachus his place,"
13201,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Who most of all the Wooers gave him grace.
13202,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And now Ulysses and his swain got near,"
13203,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When round about them visited their ear
13204,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The hollow harp’s delicious-stricken string,"
13205,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To which did Phemius, near the Wooers, sing."
13206,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then by the hand Ulysses took his swain,"
13207,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said: “Eumæus, one may here see plain,"
13208,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In many a grace, that Laertiades"
13209,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Built here these turrets, and,’mongst others these,"
13210,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His whole court arm’d with such a goodly wall,"
13211,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The cornice, and the cope, majestical,"
13212,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His double gates, and turrets, built too strong"
13213,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For force or virtue ever to expugn.
13214,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I know the feasters in it now abound,"
13215,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their cates cast such a savour; and the sound
13216,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The harp gives argues an accomplish’d feast.
13217,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,_The Gods made music banquet’s dearest guest.”_
13218,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“These things,” said he, “your skill may tell with ease,"
13219,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since you are grac’d with greater knowledges.
13220,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But now consult we how these works shall sort,"
13221,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If you will first approach this praiséd court,"
13222,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And see these Wooers, I remaining here;"
13223,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or I shall enter, and yourself forbear?"
13224,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But be not you too tedious in your stay,"
13225,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Lest thrust ye be and buffeted away.
13226,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,_Brain hath no fence for blows;_ look to ’t I pray.”
13227,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“You speak to one that comprehends,” said he,"
13228,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Go you before, and here adventure me."
13229,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I have of old been us’d to cuffs and blows;
13230,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My mind is harden’d, having borne the throes"
13231,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of many a sour event in waves and wars,"
13232,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Where knocks and buffets are no foreigners.
13233,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And this same harmful belly by no mean
13234,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The greatest abstinent can ever wean.
13235,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,_Men suffer much bane by the belly’s rage;_
13236,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For whose sake ships in all their equipage
13237,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Are arm’d, and set out to th’ untamed seas,"
13238,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their bulks full-fraught with ills to enemies.”
13239,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Such speech they chang’d; when in the yard there lay
13240,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A dog, call’d Argus, which, before his way"
13241,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Assum’d for Ilion, Ulysses bred,"
13242,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet stood his pleasure then in little stead,"
13243,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As being too young, but, growing to his grace,"
13244,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Young men made choice of him for ev’ry chace,"
13245,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or of their wild goats, of their hares, or harts."
13246,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But his king gone, and he, now past his parts,"
13247,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lay all abjectly on the stable’s store,"
13248,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before the oxstall, and mules’ stable door,"
13249,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To keep the clothes cast from the peasants’ hands,"
13250,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"While they laid compass on Ulysses’ lands,"
13251,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The dog, with ticks (unlook’d-to) overgrown."
13252,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But by this dog no sooner seen but known
13253,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was wise Ulysses, who new-enter’d there,"
13254,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up went his dog’s laid ears, and, coming near,"
13255,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up he himself rose, fawn’d, and wagg’d his stern,"
13256,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Couch’d close his ears, and lay so; nor discern[2]"
13257,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Could evermore his dear-lov’d lord again.
13258,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses saw it, nor had pow’r t’ abstain"
13259,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From shedding tears; which (far-off seeing his swain)
13260,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He dried from his sight clean; to whom he thus
13261,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His grief dissembled: “’Tis miraculous,"
13262,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That such a dog as this should have his lair
13263,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On such a dunghill, for his form is fair."
13264,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yet, I know not, if there were in him"
13265,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Good pace, or parts, for all his goodly limb;"
13266,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or he liv’d empty of those inward things,"
13267,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As are those trencher-beagles tending kings,"
13268,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom for their pleasure’s, or their glory’s, sake,"
13269,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or fashion, they into their favour take.”"
13270,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“This dog,” said he, “was servant to one dead"
13271,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A huge time since. But if he bore his head,"
13272,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For form and quality, of such a height,"
13273,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As when Ulysses, bound for th’ Ilion fight,"
13274,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or quickly after, left him, your rapt eyes"
13275,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Would then admire to see him use his thighs
13276,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In strength and swiftness. He would nothing fly,"
13277,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor anything let ’scape. If once his eye
13278,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Seiz’d any wild beast, he knew straight his scent;"
13279,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Go where he would, away with him he went."
13280,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor was there ever any savage stood
13281,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amongst the thickets of the deepest wood
13282,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Long time before him, but he pull’d him down;"
13283,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As well by that true hunting to be shown
13284,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In such vast coverts, as for speed of pace"
13285,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In any open lawn. For in deep chace
13286,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He was a passing-wise and well-nos’d hound.
13287,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And yet is all this good in him uncrown’d
13288,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With any grace here now, nor he more fed"
13289,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Than any errant cur. His king is dead,"
13290,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Far from his country; and his servants are
13291,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So negligent they lend his hound no care.
13292,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"_Where masters rule not, but let men alone,"
13293,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,You never there see honest service done.
13294,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That man’s half-virtue Jove takes quite away,"
13295,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That once is sun-burnt with the servile day.”_
13296,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he enter’d the well-builded-tow’rs,"
13297,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up bearing right upon the glorious Wooers,"
13298,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And left poor Argus dead; his lord’s first sight
13299,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since that time twenty years bereft his light.
13300,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Telemachus did far the first behold
13301,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eumæus enter, and made signs he should"
13302,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Come up to him. He, noting, came, and took"
13303,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,On earth his seat. And then the master-cook
13304,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Serv’d in more banquet; of which, part he set"
13305,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before the Wooers, part the prince did get,"
13306,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who sate alone, his table plac’d aside;"
13307,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To which the herald did the bread divide.
13308,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"After Eumæus, enter’d straight the king,[3]"
13309,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like to a poor and heavy aged thing,"
13310,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bore hard upon his staff, and was so clad"
13311,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As would have made his mere beholder sad.
13312,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon the ashen floor his limbs he spread,"
13313,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ’gainst a cypress-threshold stay’d his head,"
13314,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The tree wrought smooth, and in a line direct"
13315,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Tried by the plumb and by the architect.
13316,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The prince then bade the herdsman give him bread,"
13317,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The finest there, and see that prostrated"
13318,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,At-all-parts plight of his giv’n all the cheer
13319,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His hands could turn to: “Take,” said he, “and bear"
13320,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These cates to him, and bid him beg of all"
13321,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These Wooers here, and to their festival"
13322,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Bear up with all the impudence he can;
13323,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,_Bashful behaviour fits no needy man.”_
13324,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He heard, and did his will. “Hold guest,” said he,"
13325,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Telemachus commends these cates to thee,"
13326,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bids thee bear up, and all these Wooers implore."
13327,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,_Wit must make impudent whom Fate makes poor.”_
13328,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O Jove,” said he, “do my poor pray’rs the grace"
13329,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To make him blessed’st of the mortal race,"
13330,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And ev’ry thought now in his gen’rous heart
13331,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To deeds that further my desires convert.”
13332,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus took he in with both his hands his store,"
13333,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And in the uncouth scrip, that lay before"
13334,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His ill-shod feet, repos’d it; whence he fed"
13335,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All time the music to the feasters play’d.
13336,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both jointly ending, then began the Wooers"
13337,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To put in old act their tumultuous pow’rs;
13338,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When Pallas standing close did prompt her friend,"
13339,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To prove how far the bounties would extend
13340,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of those proud Wooers; so, to let him try"
13341,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who most, who least, had learn’d humanity."
13342,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"However, no thought touch’d Minerva’s mind,"
13343,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That anyone should ’scape his wreak design’d.
13344,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He handsomely became all, crept about"
13345,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To ev’ry Wooer, held a forc’d hand out,"
13346,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all his work did in so like a way,"
13347,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As he had practis’d begging many a day.
13348,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And though they knew all beggars could do this,"
13349,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Yet they admir’d it as no deed of his;
13350,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though far from thought of other, us’d expence"
13351,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And pity to him, who he was, and whence,"
13352,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Inquiring mutually. Melanthius then:
13353,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Hear me, ye Wooers of the far-fam’d queen,"
13354,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About this beggar. I have seen before
13355,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This face of his; and know for certain more,"
13356,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That this swain brought him hither. What he is,"
13357,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or whence he came, flies me.” Reply to this"
13358,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Antinous made, and mock’d Eumæus thus:"
13359,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O thou renownéd herdsman, why to us"
13360,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Brought’st thou this beggar? Serves it not our hands;
13361,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That other land-leapers, and cormorands,"
13362,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Profane poor knaves, lie on us, unconducted,"
13363,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But you must bring them? So amiss instructed
13364,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Art thou in course of thrift, as not to know"
13365,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy lord’s goods wrack’d in this their overflow?
13366,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which think’st thou nothing, that thou call’st in these?”"
13367,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eumæus answer’d: “Though you may be wise,"
13368,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,You speak not wisely. Who calls in a guest
13369,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That is a guest himself? None call to feast
13370,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Other than men that are of public use,"
13371,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Prophets, or poets, whom the Gods produce,"
13372,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Physicians for men’s ills, or architects."
13373,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Such men the boundless earth affords respects
13374,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bounded in honour, and may call them well."
13375,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But poor men who calls? Who doth so excell
13376,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In others’ good to do himself an ill?
13377,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But all Ulysses’ servants have been still
13378,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eyesores in your way more than all that woo,"
13379,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And chiefly I. But what care I for you,"
13380,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As long as these roofs hold as thralls to none
13381,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The wise Penelope and her god-like son?”
13382,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Forbear,” said he, “and leave this tongue’s bold ill."
13383,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Antinous uses to be crossing still,"
13384,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And give sharp words; his blood that humour bears,"
13385,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To set men still together by the ears.
13386,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But,” turning then t’ Antinous, “O,” said he,"
13387,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“You entertain a father’s care of me,"
13388,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To turn these eating guests out. ’Tis advice
13389,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of needful use for my poor faculties,"
13390,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But God doth not allow this; there must be
13391,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Some care of poor men in humanity.
13392,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What you yourselves take, give; I not envy,"
13393,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But give command that hospitality
13394,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Be giv’n all strangers. Nor shall my pow’rs fear,"
13395,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,If this mood in me reach my mother’s ear;
13396,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Much less the servants’, that are here to see"
13397,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ulysses’ house kept in his old degree.
13398,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But you bear no such mind, your wits more cast"
13399,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To fill yourself than let another taste.”
13400,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Antinous answer’d him: “Brave-spoken man!
13401,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whose mind’s free fire see check’d no virtue can.
13402,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,If all we Wooers here would give as much
13403,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As my mind serves, his[4] largess should be such"
13404,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As would for three months serve his far-off way
13405,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From troubling your house with more cause of stay.”
13406,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he took a stool up, that did rest,"
13407,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beneath the board, his spangled feet at feast,"
13408,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And offer’d at him; but the rest gave all,"
13409,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And fill’d his fulsome scrip with festival.
13410,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And so Ulysses for the present was,"
13411,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And for the future, furnish’d, and his pass"
13412,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Bent to the door to eat. Yet could not leave
13413,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Antinous so, but said: “Do you too give,"
13414,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Lov’d lord; your presence makes a show to me
13415,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As you not worst were of the company,"
13416,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But best, and so much that you seem the king,"
13417,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And therefore you should give some better thing
13418,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Than bread, like others. I will spread your praise"
13419,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Through all the wide world, that have in my days"
13420,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Kept house myself, and trod the wealthy ways"
13421,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of other men ev’n to the title Blest;
13422,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And often have I giv’n an erring guest
13423,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(How mean soever) to the utmost gain
13424,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of what he wanted, kept whole troops of men,"
13425,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And had all other comings in, with which"
13426,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Men live so well, and gain the fame of rich."
13427,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Yet Jove consum’d all; he would have it so;
13428,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To which, his mean was this: He made me go"
13429,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Far off, for Egypt, in the rude consort"
13430,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all-ways-wand’ring pirates, where, in port,"
13431,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I bade my lov’d men draw their ships ashore,"
13432,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And dwell amongst them; sent out some t’ explore
13433,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up to the mountains, who, intemperate,"
13434,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And their inflam’d bloods bent to satiate,"
13435,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Forag’d the rich fields, hal’d the women thence,"
13436,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And unwean’d children, with the foul expence"
13437,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Both of their fames and bloods. The cry then flew
13438,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Straight to the city; and the great fields grew
13439,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With horse and foot, and flam’d with iron arms;"
13440,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When Jove (that breaks the thunder in alarms)
13441,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,An ill flight cast amongst my men; not one
13442,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Inspir’d with spirit to stand, and turn upon"
13443,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The fierce pursuing foe; and therefore stood
13444,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their ill fate thick about them; some in blood,"
13445,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And some in bondage; toils led by constraint
13446,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Fast’ning upon them. Me along they sent
13447,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Cyprus with a stranger-prince they met,"
13448,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dmetor Iasides, who th’ imperial seat"
13449,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of that sweet island sway’d in strong command.
13450,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And thus feel I here need’s contemned hand.”
13451,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“And what God sent,” said he, “this suff’ring bane"
13452,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To vex our banquet? Stand off, nor profane"
13453,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My board so boldly, lest I show thee here"
13454,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Cyprus and Egypt made more sour than there.
13455,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,You are a saucy set-fac’d vagabond.
13456,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About with all you go, and they, beyond"
13457,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Discretion, give thee, since they find not here"
13458,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The least proportion set down to their cheer.
13459,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But ev’ry fountain hath his under-floods.
13460,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,_It is no bounty to give others’ goods.”_
13461,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O Gods,” replied Ulysses, “I see now,"
13462,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,You bear no soul in this your goodly show.
13463,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beggars at your board, I perceive, should get"
13464,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Scarce salt from your hands, if themselves brought meat;"
13465,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since, sitting where another’s board is spread,"
13466,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That flows with feast, not to the broken bread"
13467,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will your allowance reach.” “Nay then,” said he,"
13468,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And look’d austerely, “if so saucy be"
13469,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your suffer’d language, I suppose, that clear"
13470,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,You shall not ’scape without some broken cheer.”
13471,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus rapt he up a stool, with which he smit"
13472,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The king’s right shoulder, ’twixt his neck and it."
13473,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He stood him like a rock. Antinous’ dart
13474,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor stirr’d Ulysses; who in his great heart
13475,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Deep ills projected, which, for time yet, close"
13476,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He bound in silence, shook his head, and went"
13477,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Out to the entry, where he then gave vent"
13478,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his full scrip, sat on the earth, and eat,"
13479,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And talk’d still to the Wooers: “Hear me yet,"
13480,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ye Wooers of the Queen. It never grieves
13481,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A man to take blows, where for sheep, or beeves,"
13482,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or other main possessions, a man fights;"
13483,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But for his harmful belly this man smites,"
13484,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whose love to many a man breeds many a woe.
13485,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And if the poor have Gods, and Furies too,"
13486,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before Antinous wear his nuptial wreath,"
13487,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He shall be worn upon the dart of death.”
13488,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Harsh guest,” said he, “sit silent at your meat,"
13489,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or seek your desp’rate plight some safer seat,"

13491,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And rend your rotten rags about your ears.”
13492,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This made the rest as highly hate his folly,"
13493,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As he had violated something holy.
13494,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When one, ev’n of the proudest, thus began:"
13495,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Thou dost not nobly, thus to play the man"
13496,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,On such an errant wretch. O ill dispos’d!
13497,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Perhaps some sacred Godhead goes enclos’d
13498,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ev’n in his abject outside; for the Gods
13499,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Have often visited these rich abodes
13500,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like such poor stranger pilgrims, since their pow’rs"
13501,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Being always shapeful) glide through towns and tow’rs,"
13502,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Observing, as they pass still, who they be"
13503,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That piety love, and who impiety.”"
13504,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This all men said, but he held sayings cheap."
13505,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all this time Telemachus did heap
13506,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sorrow on sorrow on his beating heart,"
13507,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To see his father stricken; yet let part
13508,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No tear to earth, but shook his head, and thought"
13509,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As deep as those ills that were after wrought.
13510,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Queen now, hearing of her poor guest’s stroke,"
13511,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Said to her maid (as to her Wooer she spoke),"
13512,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“I wish the famous-for-his-bow, the Sun,"
13513,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would strike thy heart so.” Her wish, thus begun,"
13514,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her lady, fair Eurynome, pursued"
13515,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her execration, and did thus conclude:"
13516,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“So may our vows call down from heav’n his end,"
13517,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And let no one life of the rest extend
13518,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His life till morning.” “O Eurynomé,”"
13519,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Replied the Queen, “may all Gods speak in thee,"
13520,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For all the Wooers we should rate as foes,"
13521,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since all their weals they place in others’ woes!
13522,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But this Antinous we past all should hate,"
13523,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As one resembling black and cruel Fate.
13524,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A poor strange wretch begg’d here, compell’d by need,"
13525,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ask’d all, and ev’ry one gave in his deed,"
13526,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fill’d his sad scrip, and eas’d his heavy wants,"
13527,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Only this man bestow’d unmanly taunts,"
13528,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And with a cruel blow, his force let fly,"
13529,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,‘Twixt neck and shoulders show’d his charity.”
13530,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These minds, above, she and her maids did show,"
13531,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"While, at his scrip, Ulysses sat below."
13532,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In which time she Eumæus call’d, and said:"
13533,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Go, good Eumæus, and see soon convey’d"
13534,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The stranger to me; bid him come and take
13535,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My salutations for his welcome’s sake,"
13536,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And my desire serve, if he hath not heard"
13537,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or seen distress’d Ulysses, who hath err’d"
13538,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like such a man, and therefore chance may fall"
13539,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He hath by him been met and spoke withal?”
13540,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O Queen,” said he, “I wish to heav’n your ear"
13541,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Were quit of this unrev’rend noise you hear
13542,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From these rude Wooers, when I bring the guest;"
13543,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Such words your ear would let into your breast
13544,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As would delight it to your very heart.
13545,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Three nights and days I did my roof impart
13546,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To his fruition (for he came to me
13547,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The first of all men since he fled the sea)
13548,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And yet he had not giv’n a perfect end
13549,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To his relation of what woes did spend
13550,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The spite of Fate on him, but as you see[5]"
13551,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A singer, breathing out of Deity"
13552,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Love-kindling lines, when all men seated near"
13553,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Are rapt with endless thirst to ever hear;
13554,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So sweeten’d he my bosom at my meat,"
13555,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Affirming that Ulysses was in Crete,"
13556,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where first the memories of Minos were,"
13557,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A guest to him there dwelling then, as dear"
13558,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As his true father; and from thence came he
13559,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tir’d on with sorrows, toss’d from sea to sea,"
13560,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To cast himself in dust, and tumble here,"
13561,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At Wooers’ feet, for blows and broken cheer."
13562,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But of Ulysses, where the Thesprots dwell,"
13563,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A wealthy people, Fame, he says, did tell"
13564,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The still survival; who his native light
13565,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was bound for now, with treasure infinite.”"
13566,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Call him,” said she, “that he himself may say"
13567,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This over to me. We shall soon have way
13568,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Giv’n by the Wooers; they, as well at gate,"
13569,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As set within doors, use to recreate"
13570,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their high-fed spirits. As their humours lead
13571,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They follow; and may well; for still they tread
13572,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Uncharg’d ways here, their own wealth lying unwasted"
13573,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In poor-kept houses, only something tasted"
13574,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their bread and wine is by their household swains,"
13575,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But they themselves let loose continual reins
13576,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To our expenses, making slaughter still"
13577,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of sheep, goats, oxen, feeding past their fill,"
13578,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And vainly lavishing our richest wine;
13579,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All these extending past the sacred line,"
13580,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For here lives no man like Ulysses now
13581,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To curb these reins. But should he once show
13582,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His country-light his presence, he and his"
13583,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Would soon revenge these Wooers’ injuries.”
13584,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, about the house, in echoes round,"
13585,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her son’s strange neesings made a horrid sound;[6]
13586,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At which the Queen yet laugh’d, and said: “Go call"
13587,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The stranger to me. Heard’st thou not, to all"
13588,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My words last utter’d, what a neesing brake"
13589,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From my Telemachus? From whence I make,"
13590,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This sure conclusion: That the death and fate
13591,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of ev’ry Wooer here is near his date.
13592,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Call, then, the guest, and if he tell as true"
13593,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What I shall ask him, coat, cloak, all things new,"
13594,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These hands shall yield him.” This said, down he went,"
13595,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And told Ulysses, “that the Queen had sent"
13596,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To call him to her, that she might enquire"
13597,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About her husband what her sad desire
13598,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Urg’d her to ask; and, if she found him true,"
13599,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both coat, and cassock (which he needed) new"
13600,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her hands would put on him; and that the bread,"
13601,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which now he begg’d amongst the common tread,"
13602,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Should freely feed his hunger now from her,"
13603,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Who all he wish’d would to his wants prefer.”
13604,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His answer was: “I will with fit speed tell
13605,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The whole truth to the Queen; for passing well
13606,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I know her lord, since he and I have shar’d"
13607,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In equal sorrows. But I much am scar’d
13608,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With this rude multitude of Wooers here,"
13609,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The rage of whose pride smites heav’n’s brazen sphere.
13610,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of whose rout when one struck me for no fault,"
13611,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Telemachus nor none else turn’d th’ assault
13612,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From my poor shoulders. Therefore, though she haste,"
13613,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Beseech the Queen her patience will see past
13614,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The day’s broad light, and then may she enquire."
13615,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,’Tis but my closer pressing to the fire
13616,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In th’ ev’ning’s cold, because my weeds, you know,"
13617,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Are passing thin; for I made bold to show
13618,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their bracks to you, and pray’d your kind supply.”"
13619,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He heard, and hasted; and met instantly"
13620,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Queen upon the pavement in his way,"
13621,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Who ask’d: “What! Bring’st thou not? What cause of stay
13622,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Find his austere supposes? Takes he fear
13623,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of th’ unjust Wooers? Or thus hard doth bear
13624,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,On any other doubt the house objects?
13625,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He does me wrong, and gives too nice respects"
13626,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his fear’d safety.” “He does right,” said he,"
13627,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“And what he fears should move the policy
13628,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of any wise one; taking care to shun
13629,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The violent Wooers. He bids bide, till sun"
13630,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hath hid his broad light. And, believe it, Queen,"
13631,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"’Twill make your best course, since you two, unseen,"
13632,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"May pass th’ encounter; you to speak more free,"
13633,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And he your ear gain less distractedly.”
13634,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“The guest is wise,” said she, “and well doth give"
13635,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The right thought use. Of all the men that live,"
13636,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Life serves none such as these proud Wooers are,"
13637,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To give a good man cause to use his care.”
13638,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus, all agreed, amongst the Wooers goes"
13639,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eumæus to the prince, and, whisp’ring close,"
13640,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Said: “Now, my love, my charge shall take up me,"
13641,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Your goods and mine). What here is, you must see"
13642,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In fit protection. But, in chief, regard"
13643,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your own dear safeguard; whose state study hard,"
13644,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Lest suff’rance seize you. Many a wicked thought
13645,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Conceal these Wooers; whom just Jove see brought
13646,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To utter ruin, ere it touch at us.”"
13647,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“So chance it, friend,” replied Telemachus,"
13648,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Your bever taken, go. In first of day"
13649,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Come, and bring sacrifice the best you may."
13650,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To me and to th’ Immortals be the care
13651,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,or whatsoever here the safeties are.”
13652,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he sat in his elaborate throne."
13653,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Eumæus (fed to satisfaction)
13654,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Went to his charge, left both the court and walls"
13655,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Full of secure and fatal festivals,"
13656,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In which the Wooers’ pleasures still would sway.
13657,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And now begun the even’s near-ending day.

13745,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus in the entry of those lofty tow’rs

13757,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With all their fat and gravy. And of both
13758,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The glorious victor shall prefer his tooth,"
13759,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To which he makes his choice of, from us all,"

13763,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This he propos’d; and this they all approv’d,"
13764,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To which Ulysses answer’d: “O most lov’d,"
13765,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By no means should an old man, and one old"
13766,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In chief with sorrows, be so over-bold"
13767,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To combat with his younger; but, alas,"
13768,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Man’s own-ill-working belly needs will pass
13769,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This work upon me, and enforce me, too,"
13770,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To beat this fellow. But then, you must do"
13771,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My age no wrong, to take my younger’s part,"
13772,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And play me foul play, making your strokes’ smart"
13773,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Help his to conquer; for you eas’ly may

13775,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your honours on it in your oaths, to yield"
13776,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His part no aid, but equal leave the field.”"
13777,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All swore his will. But then Telemachus
13778,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His father’s scoffs with comforts serious
13779,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Could not but answer, and made this reply:"
13780,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Guest! If thine own pow’rs cheer thy victory,"
13781,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Fear no man’s else that will not pass it free.
13782,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He fights with many that shall touch but thee.
13783,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I’ll see thy guest-right paid. Thou here art come
13784,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In my protection; and to this the sum
13785,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all these Wooers (which Antinous are
13786,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And King Eurymachus) conjoin their care.”
13787,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both vow’d it. When Ulysses, laying by"
13788,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His upper weed, his inner beggary"
13789,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Near show’d his shame, which he with rags prevented"
13790,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pluck’d from about his thighs, and so presented"
13791,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their goodly sight, which were so white and great,"
13792,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And his large shoulders were to view so set
13793,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By his bare rags, his arms, his breast, and all,"
13794,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So broad, and brawny—their grace natural"
13795,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Being kept by Pallas, ever standing near—"
13796,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That all the Wooers his admirers were
13797,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beyond all measure, mutual whispers driv’n"
13798,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Through all their cluster, saying: “Sure as heav’n"
13799,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Poor Irus pull’d upon him bitter blows.
13800,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Through his thin garment what a thigh he shows!”
13801,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They said; but Irus felt. His coward mind
13802,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was mov’d at root. But now he needs must find
13803,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Facts to his brags; and forth at all parts fit
13804,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The servants brought him, all his art’ries smit"
13805,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With fears and tremblings. Which Antinous saw,"
13806,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said: “Nay, now too late comes fear. No law"
13807,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou shouldst at first have giv’n thy braggart vein,"
13808,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor should it so have swell’d, if terrors strain"
13809,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy spirits to this pass, for a man so old,"
13810,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And worn with penuries that still lay hold
13811,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On his ragg’d person. Howsoever, take"
13812,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This vow from me for firm: That if, he make"
13813,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy forces stoop, and prove his own supreme,"
13814,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I’ll put thee in a ship, and down the stream"
13815,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Send thee ashore where King Echetus reigns,"
13816,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(The roughest tyrant that the world contains)
13817,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And he will slit thy nostrils, crop each ear,"
13818,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy shame cut off, and give it dogs to tear.”"
13819,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This shook his nerves the more. But both were now
13820,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Brought to the lists; and up did either throw
13821,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His heavy fists. Ulysses, in suspense"
13822,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To strike so home that he should fright from thence
13823,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His coward soul, his trunk laid prostrate there,"
13824,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or let him take more leisure to his fear,"
13825,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And stoop him by degrees. The last show’d best,"
13826,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To strike him slightly, out of fear the rest"
13827,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would else discover him. But, peace now broke,"
13828,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,On his right shoulder Irus laid his stroke.
13829,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses struck him just beneath the ear,"
13830,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His jawbone broke, and made the blood appear;"
13831,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When straight he strew’d the dust, and made his cry"
13832,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stand for himself; with whom his teeth did lie,"
13833,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Spit with his blood out; and against the ground
13834,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His heels lay sprawling. Up the hands went round
13835,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the Wooers, all at point to die"
13836,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With violent laughters. Then the king did ply
13837,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The beggar’s feet, and dragg’d him forth the hall,"
13838,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Along the entry, to the gates and wall;"
13839,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where leaving him, he put into his hand"
13840,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A staff; and bade him there use his command
13841,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On swine and dogs, and not presume to be"
13842,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lord of the guests, or of the beggary,"
13843,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since he of all men was the scum and curse;
13844,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And so bade please with that, or fare yet worse."
13845,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then cast he on his scrip, all-patch’d and rent,"
13846,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hung by a rotten cord, and back he went"
13847,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To greet the entry’s threshold with his seat.
13848,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Wooers throng’d to him, and did entreat"
13849,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With gentle words his conquest, laughing still,"
13850,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Pray’d Jove and all the Gods to give his will
13851,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What most it wish’d him and would joy him most,"
13852,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since he so happily had clear’d their coast
13853,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of that unsavoury morsel; whom they vow’d
13854,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To see with all their utmost haste bestow’d
13855,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Aboard a ship, and for Epirus sent"
13856,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To King Echetus, on whose throne was spent"
13857,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The worst man’s seat that breath’d. And thus was grac’d
13858,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Divine Ulysses, who with joy embrac’d"
13859,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ev’n that poor conquest. Then was set to him
13860,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The goodly goat’s breast promis’d (that did swim
13861,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In fat and gravy) by Antinous,"
13862,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And from a basket, by Amphinomus,"
13863,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were two breads giv’n him; who, besides, renown’d"
13864,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His banquet with a golden goblet; crown’d,"
13865,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And this high salutation: “Frolic, guest,"
13866,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And be those riches that you first possest
13867,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Restor’d again with full as many joys,"
13868,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As in your poor state I see now annoys.”
13869,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Amphinomus,” said he, “you seem to me"
13870,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Exceeding wise, as being the progeny"
13871,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of such a father as authentic Fame
13872,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hath told me was so, one of honour’d name,"
13873,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And great revenues in Dulichius,"
13874,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His fair name Nisus. He is blazon’d thus;
13875,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And you to be his son, his wisdom heiring,"
13876,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As well as wealth, his state in nought impairing."
13877,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To prove which always, let me tell you this,"
13878,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(As warning you to shun the miseries
13879,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That follow full states, if they be not held"
13880,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With wisdom still at full, and so compell’d"
13881,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To courses that abode not in their brows,"
13882,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By too much swing, their sudden overthrows)"
13883,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"_Of all things breathing, or that creep on earth,"
13884,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nought is more wretched than a human birth.
13885,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bless’d men think never they can cursed be,"
13886,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,While any power lasts to move a knee._
13887,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But when the bless’d Gods make them feel that smart,"
13888,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That fled their faith so, as they had no heart"
13889,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They bear their suff’rings, and, what well they might"
13890,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Have clearly shunn’d, they then meet in despite."
13891,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"_The mind of man flies still out of his way,"
13892,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Unless God guide and prompt it ev’ry day._
13893,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I thought me once a blesséd man with men.
13894,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And fashion’d me to all so counted then,"
13895,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Did all injustice like them, what for lust,"
13896,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or any pleasure, never so unjust"
13897,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I could by pow’r or violence obtain,"
13898,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And gave them both in all their pow’rs the rein,"
13899,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Bold of my fathers and my brothers still;
13900,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,While which held good my arts seem’d never ill.
13901,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thus is none held simply good or bad,"
13902,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But as his will is either miss’d or had.
13903,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All goods God’s gifts man calls, howe’er he gets them,"
13904,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And so takes all; what price soe’er God sets them,"
13905,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Says nought how ill they come, nor will controul"
13906,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That ravine in him, though it cost his soul."
13907,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And these parts here I see these Wooers play,"
13908,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Take all that falls, and all dishonours lay"
13909,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On that man’s Queen, that, tell your friends, doth bear"
13910,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No long time’s absence, but is passing near."
13911,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let God then guide thee home, lest he may meet"
13912,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In his return thy undeparted feet;
13913,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For when he enters, and sees men so rude,"
13914,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The quarrel cannot but in blood conclude.”
13915,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he sacrific’d, then drunk, and then"
13916,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Referr’d the giv’n bowl to the guide-of-men;
13917,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who walk’d away, afflicted at his heart,"
13918,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shook head, and fear’d that these facts would convert"
13919,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To ill in th’ end; yet had not grace to fly,"
13920,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Minerva stay’d him, being ordain’d to die"
13921,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Upon the lance of young Ulyssides.
13922,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So down he sat; and then did Pallas please
13923,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,T’ incline the Queen’s affections to appear
13924,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all the Wooers, to extend their cheer"
13925,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To th’ utmost lightning that still ushers death,"
13926,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And made her put on all the painted sheath,"
13927,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That might both set her Wooers’ fancies high,"
13928,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And get her greater honour in the eye
13929,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ev’n of her son and sov’reign than before.
13930,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who laughing yet, to show her humour bore"
13931,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No serious appetite to that light show,"
13932,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She told Eurynomé, that not till now"
13933,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,She ever knew her entertain desire
13934,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To please her Wooers’ eyes, but oft on fire"
13935,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She set their hate, in keeping from them still;"
13936,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet now she pleas’d t’ appear, though from no will"
13937,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To do them honour, vowing she would tell"
13938,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her son that of them that should fit him well
13939,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To make use of; which was, not to converse"
13940,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Too freely with their pride, nor to disperse"
13941,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His thoughts amongst them, since they us’d to give"
13942,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Good words, but through them ill intents did drive."
13943,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Eurynomé replied: “With good advise
13944,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You vow his counsel, and your open guise."
13945,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Go then, advise your son, nor keep more close"
13946,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your cheeks, still drown’d in your eyes’ overflows,"
13947,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But bathe your body, and with balms make clear"
13948,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your thicken’d count’nance. _Uncomposéd cheer,"
13949,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ever mourning, will the marrow wear._"
13950,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor have you cause to mourn; your son hath now
13951,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Put on that virtue which, in chief, your vow"
13952,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wish’d, as your blessing, at his birth, might deck"
13953,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His blood and person.” “But forbear to speak
13954,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of baths, or balmings, or of beauty, now,”"
13955,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Queen replied, “lest, urging comforts, you"
13956,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Discomfort much; because the Gods have won
13957,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The spoil of my looks since my lord was gone.
13958,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But these must serve. Call hither then to me
13959,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hippodamia and Autonoé,"
13960,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That those our train additions may supply
13961,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our own deserts. And yet, besides, not I,"
13962,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all my age, have learn’d the boldness yet"
13963,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"T’ expose myself to men, unless I get"
13964,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some other gracers.” This said, forth she went"
13965,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To call the ladies, and much spirit spent"
13966,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To make their utmost speed, for now their Queen"
13967,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would both herself show, and make them be seen."
13968,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But now Minerva other projects laid,"
13969,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And through Icarius’ daughter’s veins convey’d
13970,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Sweet sleep’s desire; in whose soft fumes involv’d
13971,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She was as soon as laid, and quite dissolv’d"
13972,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Were all her lineaments. The Goddess then
13973,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bestow’d immortal gifts on her, that men"
13974,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Might wonder at her beauties; and the beams
13975,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That glister in the Deified Supremes
13976,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,She clear’d her mourning count’nance up withall.
13977,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ev’n such a radiance as doth round empall
13978,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Crown’d Cytherea, when her order’d places"
13979,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Conduct the bevy of the dancing Graces,"
13980,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She added to her own; more plump, more high,"
13981,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And fairer than the polish’d ivory,"
13982,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rend’ring her parts and presence. This grace done,"
13983,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Away the Deity flew; and up did run
13984,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her lovely-wristed ladies, with a noise"
13985,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That blew the soft chains from her sleeping joys;
13986,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When she her fair eyes wip’d, and, gasping, said:"
13987,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“O me unblest! How deep a sweet sleep spread
13988,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His shades about me! Would Diana pleas’d
13989,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To shoot me with a death no more diseas’d,"
13990,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As soon as might be, that no more my moan"
13991,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Might waste my blood in weepings never done,"
13992,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For want of that accomplish’d virtue spher’d
13993,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In my lov’d lord, to all the Greeks preferr’d!”"
13994,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then she descended with her maids, and took"
13995,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Place in the portal; whence her beamy look
13996,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Reach’d ev’ry Wooer’s heart; yet cast she on
13997,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So thin a veil, that through it quite there shone"
13998,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A grace so stol’n, it pleas’d above the clear,"
13999,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And sunk the knees of ev’ry Wooer there,"
14000,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their minds so melted in love’s vehement fires,"
14001,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That to her bed she heighten’d all desires.
14002,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The prince then coming near, she said: “O son,"
14003,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy thoughts and judgments have not yet put on
14004,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That constancy in what becomes their good,"
14005,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which all expect in thee. Thy younger blood
14006,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Did sparkle choicer spirits; but, arriv’d"
14007,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At this full growth, wherein their form hath thriv’d"
14008,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beyond the bounds of childhood, and when now,"
14009,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beholders should affirm, ‘This man doth grow"
14010,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like the rare son of his matchless Sire,"
14011,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(His goodliness, his beauty, and his fire"
14012,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of soul aspir’d to)’ thou mak’st nothing good
14013,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy fate, nor fortune, nor thy height of blood,"
14014,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In manage of thy actions. What a deed
14015,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of foul desert hath thy gross suff’rance freed
14016,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Beneath thine own roof! A poor stranger here
14017,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Us’d most unmanly! How will this appear
14018,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all the world, when Fame shall trumpet out,"
14019,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That thus, and thus, are our guests beat about"
14020,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our court unrighted? ’Tis a blaze will show
14021,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Extremely shameful to your name and you.”
14022,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“I blame you not, O mother,” he replied,"
14023,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“That, this clear wrong sustain’d by me, you chide;"
14024,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet know I both the good and bad of all,"
14025,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Being past the years in which young errors fall.
14026,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, all this known, skill is not so exact"
14027,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To give, when once it knows, things fit their fact."
14028,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I well may doubt the prease of strangers here,"
14029,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who, bent to ill, and only my nerves near,"
14030,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,May do it in despite. And yet the jar
14031,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Betwixt our guest and Irus was no war
14032,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Wrought by the Wooers; nor our guest sustain’d
14033,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wrong in that action, but the conquest gain’d."
14034,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And would to Jove, Minerva, and the Sun,"
14035,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That all your Wooers might serve Contention
14036,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For such a purchase as the beggar made,"
14037,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And wore such weak heads! Some should death invade,"
14038,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Strew’d in the entry, some embrue the hall,"
14039,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Till ev’ry man had vengeance capital,"
14040,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sattled like Irus at the gates, his head"
14041,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’ry way nodding, like one forfeited"
14042,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To reeling Bacchus, knees nor feet his own,"
14043,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To bear him where he’s better lov’d or known.”
14044,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their speeches giv’n this end, Eurymachus"
14045,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Began his courtship, and express’d it thus:"
14046,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Most wise Icarius’ daughter! If all those,"
14047,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That did for Colchos vent’rous sail dispose
14048,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For that rich purchase, had before but seen"
14049,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Earth’s richer prize in th’ Ithacensian Queen,"
14050,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They had not made that voyage, but to you"
14051,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Would all their virtues and their beings vow.
14052,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Should all the world know what a worth you store,"
14053,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To-morrow than to-day, and next light, more"
14054,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your court should banquet; since to all dames you
14055,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Are far preferr’d, both for the grace of show,"
14056,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In stature, beauty, form in ev’ry kind"
14057,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all parts outward, and for faultless mind.”"
14058,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Alas,” said she, “my virtue, body, form,"
14059,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Gods have blasted with that only storm
14060,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That ravish’d Greece to Ilion, since my lord,"
14061,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For that war shipp’d, bore all my goods aboard."
14062,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If he, return’d, should come and govern here"
14063,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My life’s whole state, the grace of all things there"
14064,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His guide would heighten, as the spirit it bore;"
14065,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which dead in me lives, giv’n him long before."
14066,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A sad course I live now; Heav’n’s stern decree
14067,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With many an ill hath numb’d and deaded me.
14068,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He took life with him, when he took my hand"
14069,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In parting from me to the Trojan strand,"
14070,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,These words my witness: ‘Woman! I conceive
14071,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That not all th’ Achives bound for Troy shall leave
14072,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their native earth their safe returnéd bones,"
14073,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fame saying, that Troy trains up approvéd sons"
14074,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In deeds of arms, brave putters-off of shafts,"
14075,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For winging lances masters of their crafts,"
14076,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Unmatchéd riders, swift of foot, and straight"
14077,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Can arbitrate a war of deadliest weight.
14078,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hope then can scarce fill all with life’s supply,"
14079,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And of all any failing, why not I?"
14080,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor do I know, if God hath marshall’d me"
14081,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amongst the safe-return’d; or his decree
14082,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Hath left me to the thraldom order’d there.
14083,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"However, all cares be thy burthens here,"
14084,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My sire and mother tend as much as now,"
14085,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I further off, more near in cares be you."
14086,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your son to man’s state grown, wed whom you will;"
14087,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, you gone, his care let his household fill.’"
14088,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus made my lord his will, which Heav’n sees prov’d"
14089,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Almost at all parts; for the Sun remov’d
14090,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Down to his set, ere long, will lead the night"
14091,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of those abhorréd nuptials, that should fright"
14092,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Each worthy woman, which her second are"
14093,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With any man that breathes, her first lord’s care"
14094,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dead, because he to flesh and blood is dead;"
14095,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which, I fear, I shall yield to, and so wed"
14096,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A second husband; and my reason is,"
14097,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since Jove hath taken from me all his bliss.
14098,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"_Whom God gives over they themselves forsake,"
14099,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their griefs their joys, their God their devil, make._"
14100,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ’tis a great grief, nor was seen till now"
14101,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In any fashion of such men as woo
14102,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A good and wealthy woman, and contend"
14103,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who shall obtain her, that those men should spend"
14104,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her beeves and best sheep, as their chiefest ends,"
14105,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But rather that herself and all her friends
14106,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They should with banquets and rich gifts entreat.
14107,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,_Their life is death that live with other’s meat.”_
14108,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Divine Ulysses much rejoic’d to hear
14109,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His Queen thus fish for gifts, and keep in cheer."
14110,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their hearts with hope that she would wed again,"
14111,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her mind yet still her first intent retain.
14112,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Antinous saw the Wooers won to give,"
14113,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said: “Wise Queen, by all your means receive"
14114,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whatever bounty any Wooer shall use.
14115,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Gifts freely giv’n ’tis folly to refuse.
14116,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For know, that we resolve not to be gone"
14117,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To keep our own roofs, till of all some one,"
14118,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom best you like, your long-woo’d love shall win.”"
14119,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This pleas’d the rest, and ev’ry one sent in"
14120,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His present by the herald. First had place
14121,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Antinous’ gift: A robe of special grace,"
14122,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Exceeding full and fair, and twenty hues"
14123,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Chang’d lustre to it; to which choice of shows,"
14124,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Twelve massy plated buttons, all of gold,"
14125,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Enrich’d the substance, made to fairly hold"
14126,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The robe together, all lac’d down before,"
14127,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Where keeps and catches both sides of it wore.
14128,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eurymachus a golden tablet gave,"
14129,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In which did Art her choicest works engrave;
14130,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And round about an amber verge did run,"
14131,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That cast a radiance from it like the Sun.
14132,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Eurydamas two servants had that bore
14133,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Two goodly earrings, whose rich hollows wore"
14134,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Three pearls in either, like so many eyes,"
14135,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Reflecting glances radiant as the skies.
14136,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The king Pisander, great Polyctor’s heir,"
14137,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A casket gave, exceeding rich and fair."
14138,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The other other wealthy gifts commended
14139,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To her fair hand; which took, and straight ascended"
14140,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This Goddess of her sex her upper state.
14141,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her ladies all her gifts elaborate
14142,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Up bearing after. All to dancing then
14143,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Wooers went, and song’s delightful strain;"
14144,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In which they frolick’d, till the evening came,"
14145,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And then rais’d sable Hesperus his flame.
14146,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When, for their lights within, they set up there"
14147,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Three lamps, whose wicks were wood exceeding sere,"
14148,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And passing porous; which they caus’d to burn,"
14149,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their matter ever minister’d by turn
14150,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of sev’ral handmaids. Whom Ulysses seeing
14151,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Too conversant with Wooers, ill-agreeing"
14152,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With guise of maids, advis’d in this fair sort:"
14153,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Maids of your long-lack’d King, keep you the port"
14154,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your Queen’s chaste presence bears. Go up to her,"
14155,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Employ your looms, or rocks, and keep ye there;"
14156,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I’ll serve to feed these lamps, should these lords’ dances"

14160,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They wantonly brake out in laughters all,"
14161,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Look’d on each other; and to terms did fall
14162,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cheek-proud Melantho, who was Dolius’ seed,"
14163,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Kept by the Queen, that gave her dainty bread"
14164,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Fit for her daughter; and yet won not so
14165,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her heart to her to share in any woe
14166,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She suffer’d for her lord, but she was great"
14167,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With great Eurymachus, and her love’s heat"
14168,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In his bed quench’d. And this choleric thing
14169,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Bestow’d this railing language on the King:
14170,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Base stranger, you are taken in your brain,"
14171,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,You talk so wildly. Never you again
14172,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Can get where you were born, and seek your bed"
14173,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In some smith’s hovel, or the marketsted,"
14174,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But here you must take confidence to prate
14175,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Before all these; for fear can get no state
14176,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In your wine-hardy stomach. Or ’tis like
14177,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To prove your native garb, your tongue will strike"
14178,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On this side of your mouth still, being at best."
14179,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Is the man idle-brain’d for want of rest?
14180,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or proud because he beat the roguish beggar?
14181,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Take heed, Sir, lest some better man beleager"
14182,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your ears with his fists, and set headlong hence"
14183,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your bold abode here with your blood’s expence.”
14184,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He, looking sternly on her, answer’d her:"

14186,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your usage to the prince, that he may fall"
14187,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Foul on your fair limbs till he tell them all.”

14189,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In fear about their business, ev’ry one"
14190,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Confessing he said well. But he stood now
14191,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Close by the cressets, and did looks bestow"
14192,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,On all men there; his brain employ’d about
14193,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some sharper business than to dance it out,"
14194,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which had not long to go. Nor therefore would

14198,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eurymachus provok’d him first, and made"
14199,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His fellow laugh, with a conceit he had"
14200,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fetch’d far from what was spoken long before,"
14201,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That his poor form perhaps some Deity bore.
14202,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“It well may chance,” said he, “some God doth bear"
14203,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This man’s resemblance, for, thus standing near"
14204,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The glist’ring torches, his slick’d head doth throw"
14205,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beams round about it as those cressets do,"
14206,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For not a hair he hath to give it shade.
14207,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Say, will thy heart serve t’ undertake a trade"
14208,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For fitting wages? Should I take thee hence
14209,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To walk my grounds, and look to ev’ry fence,"
14210,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or plant high trees, thy hire should raise thy forces"
14211,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Food store, and clothes. But these same idle courses"
14212,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou art so prompt in that thou wilt not work,"
14213,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But forage up and down, and beg, and lurk"
14214,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In ev’ry house whose roofs hold any will
14215,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To feed such fellows. That thy gut may fill,"
14216,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Gives end to all thy being.” He replied:
14217,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“I wish, at any work we two were tried,"
14218,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In height of spring-time, when heav’n’s lights are long,"
14219,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I a good crook’d scythe that were sharp and strong,"
14220,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You such another, where the grass grew deep,"
14221,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up by day-break, and both our labours keep"
14222,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up till slow darkness eas’d the labouring light,"
14223,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fasting all day, and not a crumb till night;"
14224,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,We then should prove our either workmanship.
14225,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or if, again, beeves, that the goad or whip"
14226,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were apt t’ obey before a tearing plow,"
14227,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Big lusty beasts, alike in bulk and brow,"
14228,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Alike in labour, and alike in strength,"
14229,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our task four acres, to be till’d in length"
14230,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of one sole day; again: then you should try
14231,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If the dull glebe before the plow should fly,"
14232,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or I a long stitch could bear clean and even.
14233,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or lastly, if the Guide of earth and heaven"
14234,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Should stir stern war up, either here or there,"
14235,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And that at this day I had double spear,"
14236,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And shield, and steel casque fitting for my brows;"
14237,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At this work likewise, ’midst the foremost blows,"
14238,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your eyes should note me, and get little cause"
14239,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To twit me with my belly’s sole applause.
14240,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But you affect t’ affect with injury,"
14241,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your mind ungentle, seem in valour high,"
14242,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Because ’gainst few, and those not of the best,"
14243,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your conversation hath been still profest.
14244,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But if Ulysses, landed on his earth,"
14245,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And enter’d on the true right of his birth,"
14246,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Should come and front ye, straight his ample gates"
14247,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your feet would hold too narrow for your fates.”
14248,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He frown’d, rag’d, call’d him wretch, and vow’d"
14249,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To be his death, since he durst prove so proud"
14250,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst so many, to tell him so home"
14251,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What he affected; ask’d, if overcome"
14252,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With wine he were, or, as his minion said,"
14253,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Talk’d still so idly, and were palsiéd"
14254,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his mind’s instruments, or was proud because"
14255,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He gat from Irus off with such applause?
14256,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all which, snatching up a stool, he threw;"
14257,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When old Ulysses to the knees withdrew
14258,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of the Dulichian lord, Amphinomus,"
14259,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As if he fear’d him. His dart missing thus
14260,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His aged object, and his page’s hand"

14263,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Down fell the sounding ewer, and after it"
14264,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The guiltless page lay sprawling in the dust,"
14265,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And crying out. When all the Wooers thrust
14266,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A tumult up amongst them, wishing all"
14267,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The rogue had perish’d in some hospital,"
14268,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before his life there stirr’d such uproars up,"
14269,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And with rude speeches spice their pleasures’ cup.
14270,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all this for a beggar to fulfill
14271,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A filthy proverb: _Good still yields to ill._
14272,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The prince cried out on them, to let the bad"
14273,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Obscure the good so; told them they were mad,"
14274,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Abus’d their banquet, and affirm’d some God"
14275,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Tried mast’ries with them; bade them take their load
14276,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of food and wine, sit up, or fall to bed"
14277,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,At their free pleasures; and since he gave head
14278,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all their freedoms, why should they mistake"
14279,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their own rich humours for a beggar’s sake?
14280,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All bit their lips to be so taken down,"
14281,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And taught the course that should have been their own,"
14282,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Admir’d the prince; and said he bravely spoke.
14283,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But Nisus’ son then struck the equal stroke,"
14284,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said: “O friends, let no man here disdain"
14285,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To put up equal speeches, nor maintain"

14292,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our pow’rs with sleep, resigning first the guest"
14293,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up to the prince, that holds all interest"

14296,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This all approv’d; when noble Mulius,"
14297,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Herald-in-chief to lord Amphinomus,"
14298,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The wine distributed with rev’rend grace

14331,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet did divine Ulysses keep his roof,"

14346,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Consorting the design for Ilion;
14347,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your eyes may see how much they are infected,"

14361,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The son, obeying, did Euryclea call,"
14362,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And bade her shut in th’ utter porches all

14365,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By his neglect with rust, his father gone,"

14400,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Till day’s fair weed did all the world invest.
14401,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus was divine Ulysses left alone
14402,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With Pallas, plotting foul confusion"
14403,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To all the Wooers. Forth then came the Queen;

14413,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And there she sat; about whom came her maids,"
14414,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who brought upon a table store of breads,"
14415,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And bowls that with the Wooers’ wine were crown’d.
14416,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The embers then they cast upon the ground
14417,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From out the lamps, and other fuel added,"
14418,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That still with cheerful flame the sad house gladded.
14419,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Melantha seeing still Ulysses there,"

14423,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And quickly, too, lest ye be singed away"
14424,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With burning firebrands.” He, thus seeing their fray"
14425,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Continued by her with such spleen, replied:"
14426,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“Minion! What makes your angry blood thus chide
14427,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My presence still? Is it because you see
14428,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I shine not in your wanton bravery,"
14429,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But wear these rags? It fits the needy fate
14430,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That makes me beg thus of the common state.
14431,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Such poor souls, and such beggars, yet are men;"
14432,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And ev’n my mean means means had to maintain

14441,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove oft pulls down, as thus he ruin’d me;"
14442,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His will was such, which is his equity."
14443,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore, woman, bear you fitting hand"
14444,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On your behaviour, lest your spirit thus mann’d,"
14445,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And cherish’d with your beauties, when they wane,"
14446,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Comes down, your pride now being then your bane;"

14455,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Queen gave ear, and thus suppress’d the flame:"
14456,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Thou quite without a brow, past female shame,"
14457,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I hear thy monstrous boldness, which thy head"

14459,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And from myself too, and ev’ry part"
14460,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy knowledge serves thee, that, to ease my heart"
14461,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So punish’d in thy witness, my desire"
14462,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dwelt on this stranger, that I might inquire"

14469,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,She did this little freely; and he sat
14470,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Close by the Queen, who ask’d him, Whence, and what"

14472,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Where liv’d his parents? Whence he fetch’d his race?
14473,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O woman,” he replied, “with whom no man,"

14499,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I should be irksome to your ladies here,"
14500,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And you yourself would say you urg’d your ear
14501,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To what offends it, my still-broken eyne"
14502,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Supposing wounded with your too-much wine.”
14503,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Stranger,” said she, “you fear your own excess"
14504,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With giving me too great a nobleness.
14505,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Gods my person, beauty, virtue too,"
14506,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Long since subverted, when the Ilion woe"
14507,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Greek design attempted; in which went
14508,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My praise and honour. In his government
14509,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had I deserv’d your utmost grace, but now"
14510,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sinister Deity makes dishonour woo,"

14514,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To win me, spending on me all mine own;"
14515,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will wed me, in my spite; and these are those"
14516,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That take from me all virtue to dispose
14517,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or guest or suppliant, or take any course"
14518,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst my heralds, that should all disburse,"
14519,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To order anything. Though I need none
14520,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To give me grief at home, abroad errs one"
14521,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That my veins shrink for, whom these holding gone,"
14522,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their nuptials hasten, and find me as slow."
14523,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Good spirits prompted me to make a show
14524,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of undertaking a most curious task,"
14525,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That an unmeasur’d space of time would ask;
14526,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which they enduring long would often say,"
14527,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When ends thy work? I soon had my delay,"
14528,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And pray’d their stay; for though my lord were dead,"
14529,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His father’s life yet matter ministred
14530,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That must employ me; which, to tell them true,"
14531,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was that great work I nam’d. For now near drew
14532,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Laertes’ death, and on my hand did lie"
14533,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His funeral-robe, whose end, being now so nigh,"
14534,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I must not leave, and lose so much begun,"
14535,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The rather lest the Greek dames might be won
14536,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To tax mine honour, if a man so great"
14537,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Should greet his grave without his winding sheet.
14538,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pride made them credulous, and I went on;"
14539,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When whatsoever all the day had done
14540,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I made the night help to undo again,"
14541,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though oil and watch it cost, and equal pain."
14542,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Three years my wit secur’d me undiscern’d,"
14543,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet, when the fourth came, by my maids discern’d,"
14544,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"False careless wenches, how they were deluded;"
14545,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When, by my light discern’d, they all intruded,"
14546,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Used threat’ning words, and made me give it end;"
14547,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And then could I to no more length extend
14548,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My linger’d nuptials; not a counsel more
14549,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was to be stood upon; my parents bore
14550,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Continual hand on me to make me wed;
14551,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My son grew angry that so ruinéd
14552,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His goods were by them. He is now a man
14553,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wise in a great degree, and one that can"
14554,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Himself give order to his household fare;
14555,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And Jove give equal glory to his care.
14556,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But thus you must not pass me; I must know,"
14557,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It may be for more end, from whence doth grow"
14558,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your race and you; for I suppose you none
14559,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sprung of old oak, or justled out of stone.”"
14560,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He answer’d: “O Ulysses’ rev’rend wife!
14561,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Yet hold you purpose to inquire my life?
14562,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I’ll tell you, though it much afflict me more"
14563,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Than all the sorrows I have felt before.
14564,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As worthily it may, since so long time"
14565,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As I have wander’d from my native clime,"
14566,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Through human cities, and in suff’rance still,"
14567,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To rip all wounds up, though of all their ill"
14568,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I touch but part, must actuate all their pain."
14569,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, ask you still, I’ll tell, though still sustain."
14570,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In middle of the sable sea there lies
14571,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"An isle call’d Crete, a ravisher of eyes,"
14572,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fruitful, and mann’d with many an infinite store;"
14573,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where ninety cities crown the famous shore,"
14574,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mix’d with all-languag’d men. There Greeks survive,"
14575,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There the great-minded Eteocretans live,"
14576,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There the Dorensians never out of war,"
14577,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Cydons there, and there the singular"
14578,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pelasgian people. There doth Cnossus stand,"
14579,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That mighty city, where had most command"
14580,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Great Jove’s disciple, Minos, who nine years"
14581,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Conferr’d with Jove, both great familiars"
14582,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In mutual counsels. And this Minos’ son,"
14583,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The mighty-minded king Deucalion,"
14584,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was sire to me and royal Idomen,"
14585,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who with Atrides went to Ilion then,"
14586,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My elder brother and the better man,"
14587,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My name Aethon. At that time began
14588,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My knowledge of Ulysses, whom my home"
14589,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Receiv’d with guest-rites. He was thither come
14590,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By force of weather, from the Malean coast"
14591,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But new got off, where he the navy lost,"
14592,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then under sail for Troy, and wind-bound lay"
14593,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Long in Amnisus; hardly got away
14594,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From horrid storms, that made him anchor there,"
14595,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In havens that sacred to Lucina were,"
14596,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dreadful and dang’rous, in whose bosom crept"
14597,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Lucina’s cavern. But in my roof slept
14598,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, shor’d in Crete; who first inquir’d"
14599,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For royal Idomen, and much desir’d"
14600,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To taste his guest-rites, since to him had been"
14601,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A welcome guest my brother Idomen.
14602,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The tenth or ’leventh light on Ulysses shin’d
14603,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In stay at Crete, attending then the wind"
14604,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For threaten’d Ilion. All which time my house
14605,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With love and entertainments curious
14606,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Embrac’d his person, though a number more"
14607,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My hospitable roofs receiv’d before,"
14608,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His men I likewise call’d, and from the store"
14609,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Allow’d them meal and heat-exciting wine,"
14610,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And oxen for their slaughter, to confine"
14611,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In my free hand the utmost of their need.
14612,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Twelve days the Greeks stay’d, ere they got them freed,"
14613,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A gale so bitter blew out of the north,"
14614,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That none could stand on earth, being tumbled forth"
14615,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By some stern God. But on the thirteenth day
14616,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The tempest ceas’d, and then went Greeks their way.”"
14617,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus many tales Ulysses told his wife,"
14618,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At most but painting, yet most like the life;"
14619,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of which her heart such sense took through her ears,"
14620,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It made her weep as she would turn to tears.
14621,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as from off the mountains melts the snow,"
14622,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which Zephyr’s breath conceal’d, but was made flow"
14623,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By hollow Eurus, which so fast pours down,"
14624,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That with their torrent floods have overflown;
14625,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So down her fair cheeks her kind tears did glide,"
14626,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her miss’d lord mourning set so near her side.
14627,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses much was mov’d to see her mourn,"
14628,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whose eyes yet stood as dry as iron or horn
14629,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his untroubled lids, which in his craft"
14630,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of bridling passion he from issue saft.
14631,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When she had giv’n her moan so many tears,"
14632,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That now ’twas satiate, her yet loving fears"
14633,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ask’d thus much further: “You have thus far tried
14634,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My love’s credulity, but if gratified"
14635,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With so long stay he was with you, you can"
14636,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Describe what weed he wore, what kind of man"
14637,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both he himself was, and what followers"
14638,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Observ’d him there.” “Alas,” said he, “the years"
14639,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Have grown so many since—this making now
14640,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their twentieth revolution—that my show
14641,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of these slight notes will set my memory sore,"
14642,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, to my now remembrance, this he wore:"
14643,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A double purple robe, drawn close before"
14644,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With golden buttons, plaited thick, and bore"
14645,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A facing where a hundred colours shin’d.
14646,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About the skirts a hound a freckled hind
14647,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In full course hunted; on the fore skirts, yet,"
14648,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He pinch’d and pull’d her down, when with her feet,"
14649,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all her force, she struggled hard for flight."
14650,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which had such life in gold, that to the sight"
14651,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It seem’d the hind itself for ev’ry hue,"
14652,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The hound and all so answering the view,"
14653,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That all admir’d all. I observ’d beside
14654,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His inner weed, so rarely beautified"
14655,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That dumb amaze it bred, and was as thin"
14656,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As any dry and tender onion skin;
14657,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As soft ’twas, too, and glister’d like the sun."
14658,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The women were to loving wonder won
14659,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By him and by his weeds. But, by the way,"
14660,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You must excuse me, that I cannot say"
14661,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He brought this suit from home, or had it there"
14662,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sent for some present, or, perhaps, elsewhere"
14663,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Receiv’d it for his guest-gift; for your lord
14664,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had friends not few, the fleet did not afford"
14665,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Many that had not fewer. I bestow’d
14666,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A well-edg’d sword on him, a robe that flow’d"
14667,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In folds and fulness, and did reach his feet,"
14668,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of richest purple; brought him to his fleet
14669,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all my honour; and besides, to add"
14670,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all this sifted circumstance, he had"
14671,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A herald there, in height a little more"
14672,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Put from the earth, that thicker shoulders wore,"
14673,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A swarth complexion and a curléd head,"
14674,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His name Eurybates; and much in stead
14675,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He stood your king, employ’d in most command,"
14676,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since most of all his mind could understand.”
14677,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When all these signs she knew for chiefly true,"
14678,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Desire of moan upon her beauties grew,"
14679,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yet, ev’n that desire suffic’d, she said:"
14680,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Till this, my guest, a wretched state array’d"
14681,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your ill-us’d person, but from this hour forth"
14682,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You shall be honour’d, and find all the worth"
14683,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That fits a friend. Those weeds these hands bestow’d
14684,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From out my wardrobe; those gold buttons sew’d
14685,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Before for closure and for ornament.
14686,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But never more must his return present
14687,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The person that gave those adornments state;
14688,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore, under an abhorréd fate,"
14689,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was he induc’d to feed the common fame,"
14690,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To visit vile Troy, ay too vile to name.”"
14691,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“No more yet mourn,” said he, “nor thus see pin’d"
14692,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your lovely person. _Weeping wastes the mind._
14693,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And yet I blame you not; for any dame
14694,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That weds one young, and brings to him his name,"
14695,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whatever man he is, will mourn his loss."
14696,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Much more respectful then must show your woes
14697,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That weep thus for Ulysses, who, Fame says,"
14698,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was equal with the Gods in all his ways.
14699,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But where no cause is there must be no moan,"
14700,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore hear me, my relation"
14701,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Shall lay the clear truth naked to your view:
14702,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I heard amongst the Thesprots for most true,"
14703,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That lord Ulysses liv’d, and stood just now"
14704,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,On his return for home; that wealth did flow
14705,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his possession, which he made not known,"
14706,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But begg’d amongst the people, since alone"
14707,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He quite was left, for all his men were lost"
14708,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In getting off from the Trinacrian coast;
14709,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Jove and the Sun was wroth with them for rape
14710,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made of his oxen, and no man let ’scape"
14711,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The rugged deeps of Neptune; only he,"
14712,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The ship’s keel only keeping, was by sea"
14713,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cast on the fair Phæacian continent,"
14714,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where men survive that are the Gods’ descent,"
14715,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And like a God receiv’d him, gave him heaps"
14716,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of wealthy gifts, and would conduct his steps"
14717,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Themselves safe home; which he might long ago
14718,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His pleasure make, but profit would not so."
14719,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He gather’d going, and had mighty store"
14720,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of gold in safeguard; so beyond the shore
14721,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That common sails kept, his high flood of wit"
14722,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bore glorious top, and all the world for it"
14723,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hath far exceeded. All this Phædon told,"
14724,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That doth the sceptre of Thesprotia hold,"
14725,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who swore to me, in household sacrifice,"
14726,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The ship was launch’d, and men to man the prise,"
14727,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That soon should set him on his country earth,"
14728,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Show’d me the goods, enough to serve the birth"
14729,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That in the tenth age of his seed should spring,"
14730,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet in his court contain’d. But then the king,"
14731,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your husband, for Dodona was in way,"
14732,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That from th’ Oraculous Oak he might display
14733,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove’s will what course for home would best prevail,"
14734,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To come in pomp, or bear a secret sail."
14735,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But me the king dispatch’d in course before,"
14736,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A ship then bound for the Dulichian shore.
14737,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So thus you see his safety whom you mourn;
14738,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who now is passing near, and his return"
14739,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No more will punish with delays, but see"
14740,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His friends and country. All which truth to thee
14741,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I’ll seal with sacred oath. Be witness, Jove,"
14742,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thou first and best of all the thron’d above!
14743,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thou house of the great Laertes’ heir,"
14744,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To whose high roofs I tender my repair,"
14745,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That what I tell the Queen event shall crown!
14746,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This year Ulysses shall possess his own,"
14747,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nay ere the next month ends shall here arrive,"
14748,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nay, ere it enters, here abide alive!”"
14749,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O may this prove,” said she; “gifts, friendship, then"
14750,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Should make your name the most renown’d of men.
14751,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But ’tis of me receiv’d, and must so sort,"
14752,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That nor my lord shall ever see his court,"
14753,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor you gain your deduction thence, for now"
14754,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The alter’d house doth no such man allow
14755,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As was Ulysses, if he ever were,"
14756,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To entertain a rev’rend passenger,"
14757,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And give him fair dismission. But, maids, see"
14758,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ye bathe his feet, and then with tapestry,"
14759,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Best sheets and blankets, make his bed, and lay"
14760,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Soft waistcoats by him, that, lodg’d warm, he may"
14761,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ev’n till the golden-seated morning’s ray
14762,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Enjoy good rest; and then, with her first light,"
14763,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bathe, and give alms, that cherish’d appetite"
14764,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He may apply within our hall, and sit"
14765,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Safe by Telemachus. Or, if th’ unfit"
14766,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And harmful mind of any be so base
14767,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To grieve his age again, let none give grace"
14768,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of doing any deed he shall command,"
14769,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"How wroth soever, to his barbarous hand."
14770,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For how shall you, guest, know me for a dame"
14771,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That pass so far, nay, turn and wind the fame"
14772,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of other dames for wisdom, and the frame"
14773,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of household usage, if your poor thin weeds"
14774,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I let draw on you want, and worser deeds,"
14775,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That may, perhaps, cause here your latest day?"
14776,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,_The life of man is short and flies away._
14777,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And if the ruler’s self of households be
14778,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ungentle, studying inhumanity,"
14779,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The rest prove worse, but he bears all the blame;"
14780,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All men will, living, vow against his name"
14781,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mischiefs and miseries, and, dead, supply"
14782,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With bitter epitaphs his memory.
14783,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But if himself be noble—noble things
14784,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Doing and knowing—all his underlings
14785,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will imitate his noblesse, and all guests"
14786,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Give it, in many, many interests.”"
14787,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“But, worthiest Queen,” said he, “where you command"
14788,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Baths and rich beds for me, I scorn to stand"
14789,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On such state now nor ever thought it yet,"
14790,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since first I left the snowy hills of Crete.
14791,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When once I fell a-shipboard those thoughts fled;
14792,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I love to take now, as long since, my bed."
14793,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though I began the use with sleepless nights,"
14794,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I many a darkness with right homely rites
14795,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Have spent ere this hour, and desir’d the morn"
14796,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would come, and make sleep to the world a scorn."
14797,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor run these dainty baths in my rude head;
14798,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor any handmaid, to your service bred,"
14799,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall touch my ill-kept feet, unless there live"
14800,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some poor old drudge here, that hath learn’d to give"
14801,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Old men good usage, and no work will fly,"
14802,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As having suffer’d ill as much as I.
14803,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But if there live one such in your command,"
14804,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I will not shame to give my foot her hand.”
14805,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She gave this answer: “O my lovéd guest,"
14806,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,There never enter’d these kind roofs for rest
14807,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Stranger or friend that so much wisdom laid
14808,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In gage for guest-rites, as your lips have paid."
14809,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,There lives an old maid in my charge that knows
14810,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The good you speak of by her many woes;
14811,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That nourish’d and brought up, with curious care,"
14812,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Th’ unhappy man; your old familiar,"
14813,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n since his mother let him view the light,"
14814,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And oft hath felt in her weak arms his weight;
14815,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And she, though now much weaker, shall apply"
14816,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her maiden service to your modesty.
14817,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Euryclea, rise, and wash the feet of one"
14818,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That is of one age with your sov’reign gone,"
14819,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Such hands, such feet hath, though of alter’d grace."
14820,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,_Much grief in men will bring on change apace.”_
14821,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She, from her aged slumber wak’d, did clear"
14822,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her heavy eyes, and instantly, to hear"
14823,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her sov’reign’s name, had work enough to dry"
14824,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her cheeks from tears, and to his memory"
14825,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These moans did offer: “O my son,” said she,"
14826,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“I never can take grief enough for thee,"
14827,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom Goodness hurts, and whom ev’n Jove’s high spleen,"
14828,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since thou art Jove-like, hates the most of men."
14829,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For none hath offer’d him so many thighs,"
14830,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor such whole hecatombs of sacrifice,"
14831,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fat and selected, as thy zeal hath done;"
14832,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For all, but praying that thy noble son,"
14833,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy happy age might see at state of man.
14834,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And yet hath Jove with mists Cimmerian
14835,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Put out the light of his returning day.
14836,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as yourself, O father, in your way"
14837,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Took these fair roofs for hospitable rites,"
14838,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet find, for them, our dogged women’s spites;"
14839,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So he, in like course, being driven to proof,"
14840,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Long time ere this, what such a royal roof"
14841,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would yield his mis’ries, found such usage there."
14842,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And you, now flying the foul language here,"
14843,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And many a filthy fact of our fair dames,"
14844,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fly me like them, and put on causeless shames"
14845,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To let me cleanse your feet. For not the cause
14846,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Queen’s command yields is the pow’r that draws
14847,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My will to wash your feet, but what I do"
14848,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Proceeds from her charge and your rev’rence too;
14849,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since I in soul am stricken with a ruth
14850,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of your distresses, and past show of truth;[2]"
14851,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your strangeness claiming little interest
14852,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In my affections. And yet many a guest
14853,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of poor condition hath been harbour’d here,"
14854,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But never any did so right appear
14855,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like king Ulysses as yourself, for state"
14856,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both of your stature, voice, and very gait.”"
14857,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“So all have said,” said he, “that ever yet"
14858,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Had the proportions of our figures met
14859,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In their observance; so right your eye
14860,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Proves in your soul your judging faculty.”
14861,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus took she up a caldron brightly scour’d,"
14862,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To cleanse his feet in; and into it pour’d
14863,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Store of cold wave, which on the fire she set;"
14864,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therein bath’d, being temperately heat,"
14865,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her sov’reign’s feet. Who turn’d him from the light,"
14866,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since suddenly he doubted her conceit,"
14867,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So rightly touching at his state before,"
14868,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A scar now seeing on his foot, that bore"
14869,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"An old note, to discern him, might descry"
14870,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The absolute truth; which, witness’d by her eye,"
14871,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was straight approv’d. He first receiv’d this sore
14872,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As in Parnassus’ tops a white-tooth’d boar
14873,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He stood in chase withal, who struck him there,"
14874,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,At such time as he liv’d a sojourner
14875,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With his grandsire, Autolycus; who th’ art"
14876,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of theft and swearing (not out of the heart,"
14877,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But by equivocation) first adorn’d
14878,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your witty man withal, and was suborn’d"
14879,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By Jove’s descent, ingenious Mercury,"
14880,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who did bestow it, since so many a thigh"
14881,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of lambs and kids he had on him bestow’d
14882,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In sacred flames, who therefore when he vow’d"
14883,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was ever with him. And this man impos’d
14884,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses’ name, the light being first disclos’d"
14885,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his first sight then, when his grandsire came"
14886,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To see the then preferrer of his fame,"
14887,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His lovéd daughter. The first supper done,"
14888,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Euryclea put in his lap her son,"
14889,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And pray’d him to bethink and give his name,"
14890,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since that desire did all desires inflame.
14891,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Daughter and son-in-law,” said he, “let then"
14892,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The name that I shall give him stand with men.
14893,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since I arriv’d here at the hour of pain,"
14894,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In which mine own kind entrails did sustain
14895,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Moan for my daughter’s yet unended throes,"
14896,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And when so many men’s and women’s woes,"
14897,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In joint compassion met of human birth,"
14898,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Brought forth t’ attend the many-feeding earth,"
14899,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let Odyssëus be his name, as one[3]"
14900,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Expos’d to just constraint of all men’s moan.
14901,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When here at home he is arriv’d at state
14902,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of man’s first youth he shall initiate
14903,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His practis’d feet in travel made abroad,"
14904,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And to Parnassus, where mine own abode"
14905,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And chief means lie, address his way, where I"
14906,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Will give him from my open’d treasury
14907,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What shall return him well, and fit the fame"
14908,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of one that had the honour of his name.”
14909,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For these fair gifts he went, and found all grace"
14910,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of hands and words in him and all his race.
14911,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amphithea, his mother’s mother, too,"
14912,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Applied her to his love, withal, to do"
14913,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In grandame’s welcomes, both his fair eyes kist,"
14914,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And brows; and then commanded to assist
14915,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Were all her sons by their respected sire
14916,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In furnishing a feast, whose ears did fire"
14917,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their minds with his command; who home straight led
14918,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A five-years-old male ox, fell’d, slew, and flay’d,"
14919,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Gather’d about him, cut him up with art,"
14920,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Spitted, and roasted, and his ev’ry part"
14921,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Divided orderly. So all the day
14922,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They spent in feast; no one man went his way
14923,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Without his fit fill. When the sun was set,"
14924,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And darkness rose, they slept, till day’s fire het"
14925,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Th’ enlighten’d earth; and then on hunting went
14926,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Both hounds and all Autolycus’ descent.
14927,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In whose guide did divine Ulysses go,"
14928,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Climb’d steep Parnassus, on whose forehead grow"
14929,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All sylvan offsprings round. And Soon they reach’d
14930,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The concaves, whence air’s sounding vapours fetch’d"
14931,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their loud descent. As soon as any sun
14932,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had from the ocean, where his waters run"
14933,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In silent deepness, rais’d his golden head,"
14934,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The early huntsmen all the hill had spread,"
14935,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their hounds before them on the searching trail,"
14936,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They near, and ever eager to assail:"
14937,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses brandishing a lengthful lance,"
14938,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of whose first flight he long’d to prove the chance.
14939,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then found they lodg’d a boar of bulk extreme,"
14940,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In such a queach as never any beam
14941,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sun shot pierc’d, nor any pass let find"
14942,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The moist impressions of the fiercest wind,"
14943,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor any storm the sternest winter drives,"
14944,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Such proof it was; yet all within lay leaves
14945,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In mighty thickness; and through all this flew
14946,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The hounds’ loud mouths. The sounds the tumult threw,"
14947,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all together, rous’d the boar, that rush’d"
14948,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst their thickest, all his bristles push’d"
14949,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From forth his rough neck, and with flaming eyes"
14950,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stood close, and dar’d all. On which horrid prise"
14951,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ulysses first charg’d; whom above the knee
14952,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The savage struck, and rac’d it crookedly"
14953,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Along the skin, yet never reach’d the bone."
14954,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses’ lance yet through him quite was thrown,"
14955,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At his right shoulder ent’ring, at his left"
14956,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The bright head passage to his keenness cleft,"
14957,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And show’d his point gilt with the gushing gore.
14958,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Down in the dust fell the extended boar,"
14959,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And forth his life flew. To Ulysses round
14960,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His uncle drew; who, woeful for his wound,"
14961,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all art bound it up, and with a charm"
14962,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stay’d straight the blood, went home, and, when the harm"
14963,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Receiv’d full cure, with gifts, and all event"
14964,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of joy and love to his lov’d home they sent
14965,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their honour’d nephew; whose return his sire
14966,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And rev’rend mother took with joys entire,"
14967,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Enquir’d all passages, all which he gave"
14968,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In good relation, nor of all would save"
14969,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His wound from utt’rance; by whose scar he came
14970,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To be discover’d by this aged dame.
14971,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which when she cleansing felt, and noted well,"
14972,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Down from her lap into the caldron fell
14973,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His weighty foot, that made the brass resound,"
14974,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Turn’d all aside, and on th’ embrewéd ground"
14975,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Spilt all the water. Joy and grief together
14976,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her breast invaded; and of weeping weather
14977,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her eyes stood full; her small voice stuck within
14978,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her part expressive; till at length his chin
14979,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She took and spake to him: “O son,” said she,"
14980,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Thou art Ulysses, nor canst other be;"
14981,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor could I know thee yet, till all my king"
14982,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I had gone over with the warméd spring.”
14983,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then look’d she for the Queen to tell her all;
14984,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yet knew nothing sure, though nought could fall"
14985,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In compass of all thoughts to make her doubt,"
14986,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Minerva that distraction struck throughout
14987,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her mind’s rapt forces that she might not tell.
14988,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, noting yet her aptness well,"
14989,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With one hand took her chin, and made all show"
14990,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of favour to her, with the other drew"
14991,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her offer’d parting closer, ask’d her why"
14992,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She, whose kind breast had nurs’d so tenderly"
14993,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His infant life, would now his age destroy,"
14994,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Though twenty years had held him from the joy
14995,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his lov’d country? But, since only she,"
14996,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"God putting her in mind, now knew ’twas he,"
14997,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He charg’d her silence, and to let no ear"
14998,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all the court more know his being there,"
14999,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lest, if God gave into his wreakful hand"
15000,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Th’ insulting Wooers’ lives, he did not stand"
15001,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On any partial respect with her,"
15002,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Because his nurse, and to the rest prefer"
15003,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her safety therefore, but, when they should feel"
15004,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His punishing finger, give her equal steel."
15005,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“What words,” said she, “fly your retentive pow’rs?"
15006,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,You know you lock your counsels in your tow’rs
15007,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In my firm bosom, and that I am far"
15008,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From those loose frailties. Like an iron bar,"
15009,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or bolt of solid’st stone, I will contain;"
15010,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And tell you this besides; that if you gain,"
15011,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By God’s good aid, the Wooers’ lives in yours,"
15012,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,What dames are here their shameless paramours;
15013,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And have done most dishonour to your worth,"
15014,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My information well shall paint you forth.”
15015,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“It shall not need,” said he, “myself will soon,"
15016,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"While thus I mask here, set on ev’ry one"
15017,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My sure observance of the worst and best.
15018,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Be thou then silent, and leave God the rest.”"
15019,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, the old dame for more water went,"
15020,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The rest was all upon the pavement spent
15021,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By known Ulysses’ foot. More brought, and he"
15022,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Supplied beside with sweetest ointments, she"
15023,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His seat drew near the fire, to keep him warm,"
15024,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And with his piec’d rags hiding close his harm.
15025,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Queen came near, and said: “Yet, guest, afford"
15026,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your further patience, till but in a word"
15027,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I’ll tell my woes to you; for well I know
15028,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That Rest’s sweet hour her soft foot orders now,"
15029,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When all poor men, how much soever griev’d,"
15030,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Would gladly get their woe-watch’d pow’rs reliev’d.
15031,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But God hath giv’n my grief a heart so great
15032,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It will not down with rest, and so I set"
15033,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My judgment up to make it my delight.
15034,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All day I mourn, yet nothing let the right"
15035,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I owe my charge both in my work and maids;
15036,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And when the night brings rest to others’ aids
15037,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I toss my bed; Distress, with twenty points,"
15038,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Slaught’ring the pow’rs that to my turning joints
15039,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Convey the vital heat. And as all night
15040,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pandareus’ daughter, poor Edone, sings,"
15041,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Clad in the verdure of the yearly springs,"
15042,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When she for Itylus, her lovéd son,"
15043,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By Zethus’ issue in his madness done
15044,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To cruel death, pours out her hourly moan,"
15045,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And draws the ears to her of ev’ry one;
15046,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So flows my moan that cuts in two my mind,"
15047,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And here and there gives my discourse the wind,"
15048,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Uncertain whether I shall with my son
15049,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Abide still here, the safe possession"
15050,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And guard of all goods, rev’rence to the bed"
15051,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of my lov’d lord, and to my far-off spread"
15052,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fame with the people, putting still in use,"
15053,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or follow any best Greek I can chuse
15054,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his fit house, with treasure infinite,"
15055,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Won to his nuptials. While the infant plight
15056,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And want of judgment kept my son in guide,"
15057,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He was not willing with my being a bride,"
15058,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor with my parting from his court; but now,"
15059,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Arriv’d at man’s state, he would have me vow"
15060,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My love to some one of my Wooers here,"
15061,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And leave his court; offended that their cheer
15062,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Should so consume his free possessions.
15063,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To settle then a choice in these my moans,"
15064,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Hear and expound a dream that did engrave
15065,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My sleeping fancy: Twenty geese I have,"
15066,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All which, me thought, mine eye saw tasting wheat"
15067,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In water steep’d, and joy’d to see them eat;"
15068,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When straight a crook-beak’d eagle from a hill
15069,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stoop’d, and truss’d all their necks, and all did kill;"
15070,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When, all left scatter’d on the pavement there,"
15071,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,She took her wing up to the Gods’ fair sphere.
15072,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I, ev’n amid my dream, did weep and mourn"
15073,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To see the eagle, with so shrewd a turn,"
15074,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stoop my sad turrets; when, methought, there came"
15075,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About my mournings many a Grecian dame,"
15076,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To cheer my sorrows; in whose most extreme
15077,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The hawk came back, and on the prominent beam"
15078,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That cross’d my chamber fell, and us’d to me"
15079,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A human voice, that sounded horribly,"
15080,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said: ‘Be confident, Icarius’ seed,"
15081,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This is no dream, but what shall chance indeed."
15082,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The geese the Wooers are, the eagle, I,"
15083,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was heretofore a fowl, but now imply"
15084,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy husband’s being, and am come to give"
15085,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Wooers’ death, that on my treasure live.’"
15086,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With this sleep left me, and my waking way"
15087,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I took, to try if any violent prey"
15088,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were made of those my fowls, which well enough"
15089,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I, as before, found feeding at their trough"
15090,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their yoted wheat.” “O woman,” he replied,"
15091,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“Thy dream can no interpretation bide
15092,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But what the eagle made, who was your lord,"
15093,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And said himself would sure effect afford
15094,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To what he told you; that confusion
15095,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all the Wooers should appear, and none"
15096,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Escape the fate and death he had decreed.”
15097,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She answer’d him: “O guest, these dreams exceed"
15098,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The art of man t’ interpret; and appear
15099,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Without all choice or form; nor ever were
15100,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Perform’d to all at all parts. But there are
15101,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To these light dreams, that like thin vapours fare,"
15102,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Two two-leav’d gates, the one of ivory,"
15103,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The other horn. Those dreams, that fantasy"
15104,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Takes from the polish’d ivory port, delude"
15105,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The dreamer ever, and no truth include;"
15106,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Those, that the glitt’ring horn-gate lets abroad,"
15107,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Do evermore some certain truth abode.
15108,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But this my dream I hold of no such sort
15109,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To fly from thence; yet, whichsoever port"
15110,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It had access from, it did highly please"
15111,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My son and me. And this my thoughts profess:
15112,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That day that lights me from Ulysses’ court
15113,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Shall both my infamy and curse consort.
15114,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I, therefore, purpose to propose them now,"
15115,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In strong contention, Ulysses’ bow;"
15116,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which he that eas’ly draws, and from his draft"
15117,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shoots through twelve axes (as he did his shaft,"
15118,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All set up in a row, and from them all"
15119,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His stand-far-off kept firm) my fortunes shall
15120,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dispose, and take me to his house from hence,"
15121,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where I was wed a maid, in confluence"
15122,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of feast and riches; such a court here then
15123,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As I shall ever in my dreams retain.”
15124,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Do not,” said he, “defer the gameful prize,"
15125,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But set to task their importunities
15126,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With something else than nuptials; for your lord
15127,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Will to his court and kingdom be restor’d
15128,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before they thread those steels, or draw his bow.”"
15129,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O guest,” replied Penelope, “would you"
15130,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus sit and please me with your speech, mine ears"
15131,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Would never let mine eyelids close their spheres!
15132,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But none can live without the death of sleep,"
15133,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Th’ Immortals in our mortal memories keep
15134,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our ends and deaths by sleep, dividing so,"
15135,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As by the fate and portion of our woe,"
15136,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our times spent here, to let us nightly try"
15137,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That while we live, as much live as we die."
15138,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In which use I will to my bed ascend,"
15139,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which I bedew with tears, and sigh past end"
15140,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Through all my hours spent, since I lost my joy"
15141,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For vile, lewd, never-to-be-naméd, Troy,"
15142,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet there I’ll prove for sleep, which take you here,"
15143,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or on the earth, if that your custom were,"
15144,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or have a bed, dispos’d for warmer rest.”"
15145,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus left she with her ladies her old guest,"
15146,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ascended her fair chamber, and her bed,"
15147,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whose sight did ever duly make her shed
15148,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tears for her lord; which still her eyes did steep,"
15149,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Till Pallas shut them with delightsome sleep.

15189,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Above him sheep-fells store; and over those
15190,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Eurynomé cast mantles. His repose
15191,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would bring no sleep yet, studying the ill"
15192,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He wish’d the Wooers; who came by him still
15193,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all their wenches, laughing, wantoning,"
15194,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In mutual lightness; which his heart did sting,"
15195,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Contending two ways, if, all patience fled,"
15196,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He should rush up and strike those strumpets dead,"
15197,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or let that night be last, and take th’ extreme"
15198,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of those proud Wooers, that were so supreme"
15199,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In pleasure of their high-fed fantasies.
15200,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His heart did bark within him to surprise

15202,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst her whelps, fly eag’rer on a man"
15203,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She doth not know, yet scents him something near,"

15206,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With those foul fashions, grew within him wild"
15207,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To be in blood of them. But, finding best"
15208,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his free judgment to let passion rest,"
15209,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He chid his angry spirit, and beat his breast,"
15210,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said: “Forbear, my mind, and think on this:"
15211,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,There hath been time when bitter agonies

15226,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Than this and that way his unrest made turn
15227,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His thoughts and body, would not quench the fire,"
15228,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And yet not have it heighten his desire
15229,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Past his discretion, and the fit enough"
15230,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of haste and speed, that went to all the proof"

15239,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy quiet up is thine; thy wife is there;
15240,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And such a son, as if thy wishes were"

15247,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yet a greater doubt employs my care,"
15248,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That if their slaughters in my reaches are,"
15249,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And I perform them, Jove and you not pleas’d,"
15250,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,How shall I fly their friends? And would stand seis’d
15251,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of counsel to resolve this care in me.”
15252,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Wretch,” she replied, “a friend of worse degree"

15289,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His curléd head, where Pluto’s orchard is,"
15290,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And entrance to our after miseries.

15309,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And to the hateful Furies gave them all
15310,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In horrid service; yet, may such fate fall"
15311,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From steep Olympus on my loathéd head,"
15312,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or fair-chair’d Phœbe strike me instant dead,"
15313,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That I may undergo the gloomy shore
15314,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To visit great Ulysses’ soul, before"
15315,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I soothe my idle blood and wed a worse.
15316,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yet, beneath how desperate a curse"
15317,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Do I live now! It is an ill that may
15318,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Be well endur’d, to mourn the whole long day,"
15319,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So night’s sweet sleeps, that make a man forget"
15320,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both bad and good, in some degree would let"
15321,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My thoughts leave grieving; but, both day and night,"
15322,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Some cruel God gives my sad memory sight.
15323,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This night, methought, Ulysses grac’d my bed"
15324,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In all the goodly state with which he led
15325,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Grecian army; which gave joys extreme
15326,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To my distress, esteeming it no dream,"
15327,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But true indeed; and that conceit I had,"
15328,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That when I saw it false I might be mad.
15329,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Such cruel fates command in my life’s guide.”
15330,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By this the morning’s orient dews had dyed
15331,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The earth in all her colours; when the King,"
15332,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his sweet sleep, suppos’d the sorrowing"
15333,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That she us’d waking in her plaintive bed
15334,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To be her mourning, standing by his head,"
15335,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As having known him there; who straight arose,"
15336,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And did again within the hall dispose
15337,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The carpets and the cushions, where before"
15338,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They serv’d the seats. The hide without the door
15339,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He carried back, and then, with held-up hands,"
15340,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He pray’d to Him that heav’n and earth commands:
15341,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O Father Jove, if through the moist and dry"
15342,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You, willing, brought me home, when misery"
15343,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had punish’d me enough by your free dooms,"
15344,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let some of these within those inner rooms,"
15345,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Startled with horror of some strange ostent,"
15346,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Come here, and tell me that great Jove hath bent"
15347,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Threat’nings without at some lewd men within.”
15348,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To this his pray’r Jove shook his sable chin,"
15349,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thunder’d from those pure clouds that, above"
15350,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The breathing air, in bright Olympus move."
15351,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Divine Ulysses joy’d to hear it roar.
15352,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Report of which a woman-miller bore
15353,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Straight to his ears; for near to him there ground
15354,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mills for his corn, that twice six women found"
15355,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Continual motion, grinding barley-meal,"
15356,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And wheat, man’s marrow. Sleep the eyes did seal"
15357,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the other women, having done"
15358,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their usual task; which yet this dame alone
15359,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had scarce giv’n end to, being, of all the rest,"
15360,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Least fit for labour. But when these sounds prest
15361,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her ears, above the rumbling of her mill,"
15362,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She let that stand, look’d out, and heav’n’s steep hill"
15363,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Saw clear and temp’rate; which made her (unware
15364,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of giving any comfort to his care
15365,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In that strange sign he pray’d for) thus, invoke:"
15366,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O King of men and Gods, a mighty stroke"
15367,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy thund’ring hand laid on the cope of stars,"
15368,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,No cloud in all the air; and therefore wars
15369,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thou bidst to some men in thy sure ostent!
15370,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Perform to me, poor wretch, the main event,"
15371,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And make this day the last, and most extreme,"
15372,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In which the Wooers’ pride shall solace them
15373,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With whorish banquets in Ulysses’ roof,"
15374,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, with sad toil to grind them meal enough,"
15375,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Have quite dissolv’d my knees. Vouchsafe, then, now"
15376,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy thunders may their latest feast foreshow.”
15377,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This was the boon Ulysses begg’d of Jove,[1]"
15378,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which, with his thunder, through his bosom drove"
15379,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A joy, that this vaunt breath’d: “Why now these men,"
15380,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Despite their pride, will Jove make pay me pain.”"
15381,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By this had other maids, than those that lay"
15382,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mix’d with the Wooers, made a fire like day"
15383,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amidst the hearth of the illustrious hall;
15384,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then the Prince, like a Celestial,"
15385,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rose from his bed, to his embalm’d feet tied"
15386,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fair shoes, his sword about his breast applied,"
15387,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Took to his hand his sharp-pil’d lance, and met,"
15388,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amidst the entry, his old nurse, that set"
15389,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His haste at sudden stand; to whom he said:
15390,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O, my lov’d nurse, with what grace have you laid"
15391,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And fed my guest here? Could you so neglect
15392,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His age, to lodge him thus? Though all respect"
15393,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I give my mother’s wisdom, I must yet"
15394,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Affirm it fail’d in this; for she hath set
15395,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At much more price a man of much less worth,"
15396,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Without his person’s note, and yet casts forth"
15397,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With ignominious hands, for his form sake,"
15398,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A man much better.” “Do not faulty make,"
15399,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Good son, the faultless. He was giv’n his seat"
15400,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Close to her side, and food till he would eat,"
15401,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Wine till his wish was serv’d; for she requir’d
15402,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His wants, and will’d him all things he desir’d;"
15403,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Commanded her chief maids to make his bed,"
15404,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But he, as one whom sorrow only fed"
15405,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all infortune, would not take his rest"
15406,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In bed, and cov’rings fit for any guest,"
15407,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But in the entry, on an ox’s hide"
15408,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Never at tanner’s, his old limbs implied,"
15409,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In warm sheep-fells; yet over all we cast
15410,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A mantle, fitting for a man more grac’d.”"
15411,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He took her answer, left the house, and went,"
15412,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Attended with his dogs, to sift th’ event"
15413,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of private plots, betwixt him and his sire"
15414,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In common counsel. Then the crew entire
15415,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all the household maids Euryclea bad
15416,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bestir them through the house, and see it clad"
15417,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In all best form; gave all their parts; and one
15418,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,She set to furnish ev’ry seat and throne
15419,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With needle works, and purple clothes of state;"
15420,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Another set to scour and cleanse the plate;
15421,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Another all the tables to make proud
15422,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With porous sponges; others she bestow’d
15423,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all speed to the spring, to fetch from thence"
15424,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Fit store of water; all at all expence
15425,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of pains she will’d to be; for this to all
15426,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Should be a day of common festival,"
15427,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And not a Wooer now should seek his home,"
15428,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Elsewhere than there, but all were bid to come"
15429,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Exceeding early, and be rais’d to heav’n"
15430,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With all the entertainment could be giv’n.
15431,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They heard with greedy ears, and ev’rything"
15432,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Put straight in practice. Twenty to the spring
15433,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Made speed for water; many in the house
15434,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Took pains; and all were both laborious
15435,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And skill’d in labour; many fell to fell
15436,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And cleave their wood; and all did more than well.
15437,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then troop’d the lusty Wooers in; and then
15438,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Came all from spring; at their heels loaded men
15439,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With slaughter’d brawns, of all the herd the prize,"
15440,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That had been long fed-up in sev’ral styes;
15441,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eumæus and his men convey’d them there,"
15442,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He, seeing now the king, began to cheer,"
15443,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thus saluted him: “How now, my guest?"
15444,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Have yet your virtues found more interest
15445,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In these great Wooers’ good respects? Or still
15446,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Pursue they you with all their wonted ill?”
15447,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“I would to heav’n, Eumæus,” he replied,"
15448,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“The Deities once would take in hand their pride,"
15449,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That such unseemly fashions put in frame
15450,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In others’ roofs, as show no spark of shame.”"
15451,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus these; and to these came Melanthius,"
15452,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Great guardian of the most egregious
15453,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rich Wooers’ herds, consisting all of goats;"
15454,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which he, with two more, drave, and made their cotes"
15455,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The sounding porticos of that fair court.
15456,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Melanthius, seeing the king, this former sort"
15457,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of upland language gave: “What? Still stay here,"
15458,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And dull these Wooers with thy wretched cheer?
15459,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Not gone for ever yet? Why now I see
15460,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This strife of cuffs betwixt the beggary,"
15461,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That yesterday assay’d to get thee gone,"
15462,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thy more roguery, needs will fall upon"
15463,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My hands to arbitrate. Thou wilt not hence
15464,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Till I set on thee; thy ragg’d impudence
15465,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Is so fast-footed. Are there not beside
15466,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Other great banquetants, but you must tide"
15467,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At anchor still with us?” He nothing said,"
15468,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But thought of ill enough, and shook his head."
15469,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then came Philœtius, a chief of men,"
15470,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That to the Wooers’ all-devouring den
15471,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A barren steer drave, and fat goats; for they"
15472,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In custom were with traffickers by sea,"
15473,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That who they would sent, and had utt’rance there."
15474,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And for these likewise the fair porches were
15475,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hurdles and sheep-pens, as in any fair."
15476,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Philœtius took note in his repair
15477,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of seen Ulysses, being a man as well"
15478,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Giv’n to his mind’s use as to buy and sell,"
15479,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or do the drudg’ry that the blood desir’d,"
15480,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, standing near Eumæus, this enquir’d:"
15481,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“What guest is this that makes our house of late
15482,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His entertainer? Whence claims he the state
15483,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His birth in this life holds? What nation?
15484,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,What race? What country stands his speech upon?
15485,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,O’er hardly portion’d by the terrible Fates.
15486,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The structure of his lineaments relates
15487,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A king’s resemblance in his pomp of reign
15488,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n thus in these rags. But poor erring men,"
15489,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That have no firm home, but range here and there"
15490,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As need compels, God keeps in this earth’s sphere,"
15491,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As under water, and this tune he sings,"
15492,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When he is spinning ev’n the cares of kings.”
15493,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus coming to him, with a kind of fear"
15494,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He took his hand, and, touch’d exceeding near"
15495,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With mere imagination of his worth,"
15496,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This salutation he sent loudly forth:
15497,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“Health! Father stranger! In another world
15498,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Be rich and happy, though thou here art hurl’d"
15499,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,At feet of never such insulting Need.
15500,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O Jove, there lives no one God of thy seed"
15501,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,More ill to man than thou. Thou tak’st no ruth—
15502,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When thou thyself hast got him in most truth—
15503,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To wrap him in the straits of most distress,"
15504,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And in the curse of others’ wickedness.
15505,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My brows have swet to see it, and mine eyes"
15506,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Broke all in tears, when this being still the guise"
15507,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of worthiest men, I have but only thought,"
15508,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That down to these ills was Ulysses wrought,"
15509,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And that, thus clad, ev’n he is error-driv’n,"
15510,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,If yet he live and sees the light of heav’n.
15511,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, if now dead, and in the house of hell,"
15512,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,O me! O good Ulysses! That my weal
15513,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Did ever wish, and when, but half a man"
15514,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the people Cephallenian,"
15515,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His bounty to his oxen’s charge preferr’d
15516,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,One in that youth; which now is grown a herd
15517,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Unspeakable for number, and feed there"
15518,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With their broad heads, as thick as of his ear"
15519,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A field of corn is to a man. Yet these
15520,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Some men advise me with this noted prease
15521,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Wooers may devour, and wish me drive"
15522,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up to their feasts with them, that neither give"
15523,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His son respect, though in his own free roof,"
15524,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor have the wit to fear th’ infallible proof
15525,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Heav’nly vengeance, but make offer now"
15526,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The long-lack’d King’s possessions to bestow
15527,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In their self-shares. Methinks the mind in me
15528,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Doth turn as fast, as in a flood or sea"
15529,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A raging whirlpit doth, to gather in"
15530,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To fishy death those swimmers in their sin;
15531,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or feeds a motion as circular
15532,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To drive my herds away. But while the son
15533,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bears up with life, ’twere heinous wrong to run"
15534,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To other people with them, and to trust"
15535,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Men of another earth. And yet more just
15536,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It were to venture their laws, the main right"
15537,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made still their masters, than at home lose quite"
15538,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their right and them, and sit and grieve to see"
15539,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The wrong authoriz’d by their gluttony.
15540,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And I had long since fled, and tried th’ event"
15541,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With other proud kings, since more insolent"
15542,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These are than can be borne, but that ev’n still"
15543,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I had a hope that this, though born to ill,"
15544,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would one day come from some coast, and their last"
15545,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In his roofs strew with ruins red and vast.”
15546,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Herdsman,” said he, “because thou art in show"
15547,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor lewd nor indiscreet, and that I know"
15548,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There rules in thee an understanding soul,"
15549,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I’ll take an oath, that in thee shall control"
15550,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All doubt of what I swear: Be witness, Jove,"
15551,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That sway’st the first seat of the thron’d above,"
15552,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This hospitable table, and this house,"
15553,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That still hold title for the strenuous
15554,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Son of Laertes, that, if so you please,"
15555,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your eyes shall witness Laertiades
15556,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Arriv’d at home, and all these men that reign"
15557,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In such excesses here shall here lie slain!”
15558,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He answer’d: “Stranger! Would just Jove would sign
15559,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,What you have sworn! In your eyes’ beams should shine
15560,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What pow’rs I manage, and how these my hands"
15561,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Would rise and follow where he first commands.”
15562,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So said Eumæus, praying all the Sky"
15563,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That wise Ulysses might arrive and try.
15564,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus while they vow’d, the Wooers sat as hard"
15565,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On his son’s death, but had their counsels scar’d,"
15566,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For on their left hand did an eagle soar,"
15567,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And in her seres a fearful pigeon bore.
15568,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which seen, Amphinomus presag’d: “O friends,"
15569,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our counsels never will receive their ends
15570,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In this man’s slaughter. Let us therefore ply
15571,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our bloody feast, and make his oxen die.”"
15572,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus came they in, cast off on seats their cloaks,"
15573,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And fell to giving sacrificing strokes
15574,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of sheep and goats, the chiefly fat and great,"
15575,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Slew fed-up swine, and from the herd a neat."
15576,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The inwards roasted they dispos’d bewixt
15577,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their then observers, wine in flagons mixt."
15578,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The bowls Eumæus brought, Philœtius bread,"
15579,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Melanthius fill’d the wine. Thus drank and fed
15580,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The feastful Wooers. Then the prince, in grace"
15581,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his close project, did his father place"
15582,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amidst the pavéd entry, in a seat"
15583,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Seemless and abject, a small board and meat"
15584,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of th’ only inwards; in a cup of gold
15585,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet sent him wine, and bade him now drink bold,"
15586,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All his approaches he himself would free
15587,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"’Gainst all the Wooers, since he would not see"
15588,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His court made popular, but that his sire"
15589,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Built it to his use. Therefore all the fire
15590,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Blown in the Wooers’ spleens he bade suppress,"
15591,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And that in hands nor words they should digress
15592,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From that set peace his speech did then proclaim.
15593,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They bit their lips and wonder’d at his aim
15594,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In that brave language; when Antinous said:
15595,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Though this speech, Grecians, be a mere upbraid,"
15596,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Yet this time give it pass. The will of Jove
15597,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Forbids the violence of our hands to move,"
15598,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But of our tongues we keep the motion free,"
15599,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, therefore, if his further jollity"
15600,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tempt our encounter with his braves, let’s check"
15601,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His growing insolence, though pride to speak"
15602,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Fly passing high with him.” The wise prince made
15603,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No more spring of his speech, but let it fade."
15604,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And now the heralds bore about the town
15605,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The sacred hecatomb; to whose renown
15606,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fair-hair’d Greeks assembled, and beneath"
15607,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Apollo’s shady wood the holy death
15608,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They put to fire; which, made enough, they drew,"
15609,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Divided all, that did in th’ end accrue"
15610,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To glorious satisfaction. Those that were
15611,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Disposers of the feast did equal cheer
15612,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bestow on wretched Laertiades,"
15613,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With all the Wooers’ souls; it so did please
15614,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Telemachus to charge them. And for these
15615,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Minerva would not see the malices
15616,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Wooers bore too much contain’d, that so"
15617,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ulysses’ mov’d heart yet might higher flow
15618,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In wreakful anguish. There was wooing there,"
15619,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the rest, a gallant that did bear"
15620,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The name of one well-learn’d in jests profane,"
15621,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His name Ctesippus, born a Samian;"
15622,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who, proud because his father was so rich,"
15623,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Had so much confidence as did bewitch
15624,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His heart with hope to wed Ulysses’ wife;
15625,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And this man said: “Hear me, my lords, in strife"
15626,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For this great widow. This her guest did share
15627,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Even feast with us, with very comely care"
15628,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of him that order’d it; for ’tis not good
15629,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor equal to deprive guests of their food,"
15630,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And specially whatever guest makes way
15631,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To that house where Telemachus doth sway;
15632,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And therefore I will add to his receit
15633,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A gift of very hospitable weight,"
15634,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which he may give again to any maid
15635,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That bathes his grave feet, and her pains see paid,"
15636,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or any servant else that the divine
15637,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ulysses’ lofty battlements confine.”
15638,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus snatch’d he with a valiant hand, from out"
15639,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The poor folks’ common basket, a neat’s foot,"
15640,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And threw it at Ulysses; who his head
15641,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shrunk quietly aside, and let it shed"
15642,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His malice on the wall; the suff’ring man
15643,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A laughter raising most Sardinian,"
15644,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With scorn and wrath mix’d, at the Samian."
15645,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whom thus the prince reprov’d: “Your valour wan
15646,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Much grace, Ctesippus, and hath eas’d your mind"
15647,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With mighty profit, yet you see it find"
15648,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,No mark it aim’d at; the poor stranger’s part
15649,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Himself made good enough, to ’scape your dart."
15650,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But should I serve thee worthily, my lance"
15651,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Should strike thy heart through, and, in place t’ advance"
15652,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thyself in nuptials with his wealth, thy sire"
15653,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Should make thy tomb here; that the foolish fire
15654,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all such valours may not dare to show
15655,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,These foul indecencies to me. I now
15656,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Have years to understand my strength, and know"
15657,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The good and bad of things, and am no more"
15658,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At your large suff’rance, to behold my store"
15659,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Consum’d with patience, see my cattle slain,"
15660,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My wine exhausted, and my bread in vain"
15661,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Spent on your license; for to one then young
15662,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So many enemies were match too strong.
15663,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But let me never more be witness to
15664,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your hostile minds, nor those base deeds ye do;"
15665,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For, should ye kill me in my offer’d wreak,"
15666,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I wish it rather, and my death would speak"
15667,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Much more good of me, than to live and see"
15668,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Indignity upon indignity,"
15669,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My guests provok’d with bitter words and blows,"
15670,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My women-servants dragg’d about my house
15671,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To lust and rapture.” This made silence seize
15672,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The house throughout; till Damastorides
15673,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At length the calm brake, and said: “Friend, forbear"
15674,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To give a just speech a disdainful ear;
15675,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The guest no more touch, nor no servant here."
15676,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Myself will to the Prince and Queen commend
15677,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A motion grateful, if they please to lend"
15678,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Grateful receipt. As long as any hope
15679,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Left wise Ulysses any passage ope
15680,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his return in our conceits, so long"
15681,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Queen’s delays to our demands stood strong
15682,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In cause and reason, and our quarrels thus"
15683,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With guests, the Queen, or her Telemachus,"
15684,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Set never foot amongst our lib’ral feast;
15685,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For should the King return, though thought deceas’d,"
15686,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It had been gain to us, in finding him,"
15687,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To lose his wife. But now, since nothing dim"
15688,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The days break out that show he never more
15689,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall reach the dear touch of his country-shore,"
15690,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sit by your mother, in persuasion"
15691,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That now it stands her honour much upon
15692,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To choose the best of us, and, who gives most,"
15693,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To go with him home. For so, all things lost"
15694,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In sticking on our haunt so, you shall clear"
15695,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Recover in our no more concourse here,"
15696,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Possess your birth-right wholly, eat and drink,"
15697,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And never more on our disgraces think.”
15698,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“By Jove, no, Agelaus! For I swear"
15699,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By all my father’s sorrows, who doth err"
15700,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Far off from Ithaca, or rests in death,"
15701,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I am so far from spending but my breath
15702,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To make my mother any more defer
15703,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her wishéd nuptials, that I’ll counsel her"
15704,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To make her free choice; and besides will give
15705,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Large gifts to move her. But I fear to drive
15706,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or charge her hence; for God will not give way
15707,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To any such course, if I should assay.”"
15708,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At this, Minerva made for foolish joy"
15709,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Wooers mad, and rous’d their late annoy"
15710,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To such a laughter as would never down.
15711,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They laugh’d with others’ cheeks, ate meat o’erflown"
15712,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With their own bloods, their eyes stood full of tears"
15713,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For violent joys; their souls yet thought of fears,"
15714,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which Theoclymenus express’d, and said:"
15715,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O wretches! Why sustain ye, well apaid,"
15716,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your imminent ill? A night, with which death sees,"
15717,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your heads and faces hides beneath your knees;
15718,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Shrieks burn about you; your eyes thrust out tears;
15719,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These fixéd walls, and that main beam that bears"
15720,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The whole house up, in bloody torrents fall;"
15721,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The entry full of ghosts stands; full the hall
15722,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of passengers to hell; and under all
15723,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The dismal shades; the sun sinks from the poles;
15724,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And troubled air pours bane about your souls.”
15725,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They sweetly laughed at this. Eurymachus
15726,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To mocks dispos’d, and said: “This new-come-t’-us"
15727,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is surely mad, conduct him forth to light"
15728,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In th’ open market-place; he thinks ’tis night
15729,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Within the house.” “Eurymachus,” said he,"
15730,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“I will not ask for any guide of thee,"
15731,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I both my feet enjoy, have ears and eyes,"
15732,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And no mad soul within me; and with these
15733,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will I go forth the doors, because I know"
15734,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That imminent mischief must abide with you,"
15735,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which not a man of all the Wooers here
15736,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Shall fly or ’scape. Ye all too highly bear
15737,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your uncurb’d heads. Impieties ye commit,"
15738,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And ev’ry man affect with forms unfit.”
15739,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he left the house, and took his way"
15740,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Home to Piræus; who, as free as day,"
15741,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was of his welcome. When the Wooers’ eyes
15742,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Chang’d looks with one another, and, their guise"
15743,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of laughters still held on, still eas’d their breasts"
15744,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of will to set the Prince against his guests,"
15745,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Affirming that of all the men alive
15746,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He worst luck had, and prov’d it worst to give"
15747,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Guests entertainment; for he had one there
15748,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A wand’ring hunter-out of provender,"
15749,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"An errant beggar ev’ry way, yet thought"
15750,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(He was so hungry) that he needed nought
15751,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But wine and victuals, nor knew how to do,"
15752,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor had a spirit to put a knowledge to,"
15753,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But liv’d an idle burthen to the earth.
15754,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Another then stepp’d up, and would lay forth"
15755,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His lips in prophecy, thus: “But, would he hear"
15756,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His friends’ persuasions, he should find it were"
15757,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,More profit for him to put both aboard
15758,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For the Sicilian people, that afford"
15759,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,These feet of men good price; and this would bring[2]
15760,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Good means for better guests.” These words made wing
15761,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his ears idly, who had still his eye"
15762,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon his father, looking fervently"
15763,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When he would lay his long-withholding hand
15764,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On those proud Wooers. And, within command"
15765,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all this speech that pass’d, Icarius’ heir,"
15766,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The wise Penelope, her royal chair"
15767,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Had plac’d of purpose. Their high dinner then
15768,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With all-pleas’d palates these ridiculous men
15769,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fell sweetly to, as joying they had slain"
15770,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Such store of banquet. But there did not reign
15771,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A bitterer banquet-planet in all heav’n
15772,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Than that which Pallas had to that day driv’n,"
15773,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, with her able friend now, meant t’ appose,"
15774,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since they till then were in deserts so gross.

15844,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And hospitable table, that in love"
15845,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He set before him, nor the voice of Jove,"
15846,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, seizing first his mares, he after slew"
15847,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His host himself. From those mares’ search now grew
15848,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ulysses known t’ Iphitus; who that bow
15849,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At their encounter did in love bestow,"
15850,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which great Eurytus’ hand had borne before,"
15851,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Iphitus’ father) who, at death’s sad door,"
15852,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his steep turrets, left it to his son."
15853,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses gave him a keen falchion,"
15854,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And mighty lance. And thus began they there
15855,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their fatal loves; for after never were
15856,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their mutual tables to each other known,"
15857,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Because Jove’s son th’ unworthy part had shown
15858,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of slaughtering this God-like loving man,"
15859,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eurytus’ son, who with that bow began"
15860,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And ended love t’ Ulysses; who so dear
15861,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A gift esteem’d it, that he would not bear"
15862,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his black fleet that guest-rite to the war,"
15863,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, in fit memory of one so far"
15864,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his affection, brought it home, and kept"
15865,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His treasure with it; where till now it slept.
15866,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And now the Queen of women had intent
15867,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To give it use, and therefore made ascent"
15868,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up all the stairs’ height to the chamber door,"
15869,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whose shining leaves two bright pilasters bore
15870,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To such a close when both together went
15871,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It would resist the air in their consent.
15872,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The ring she took then, and did draw aside"
15873,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A bar that ran within, and then implied"
15874,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The key into the lock, which gave a sound,"
15875,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The bolt then shooting, as in pasture ground"
15876,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A bull doth low, and make the valleys ring;"
15877,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So loud the lock humm’d when it loos’d the spring,"
15878,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ope the doors flew. In she went, along"
15879,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The lofty chamber, that was boarded strong"
15880,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With heart of oak, which many years ago"
15881,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The architect did smooth and polish so
15882,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That now as then he made it freshly shine,"
15883,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And tried the evenness of it with a line.
15884,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,There stood in this room presses that enclos’d
15885,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Robes odoriferous, by which repos’d"
15886,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The bow was upon pins; nor from it far
15887,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Hung the round quiver glitt’ring like a star;
15888,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Both which her white extended hand took down.
15889,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then sat she low, and made her lap a crown"
15890,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of both these relics, which she wept to see,"
15891,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And cried quite out with loving memory
15892,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of her dear lord; to whose worth paying then
15893,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Kind debts enow, she left, and, to the men"
15894,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Vow’d to her wooing, brought the crooked bow,"
15895,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And shaft-receiving quiver, that did flow"
15896,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With arrows beating sighs up where they fell.
15897,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then, with another chest, replete as well"
15898,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With games won by the King, of steel and brass,"
15899,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her maids attended. Past whom making pass
15900,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To where her Wooers were, she made her stay"
15901,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amidst the fair hall door, and kept the ray"
15902,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of her bright count’nance hid with veils so thin,"
15903,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That though they seem’d t’ expose, they let love in;"
15904,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her maids on both sides stood; and thus she spake:
15905,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Hear me, ye Wooers, that a pleasure take"
15906,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To do me sorrow, and my house invade"
15907,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To eat and drink, as if ’twere only made"
15908,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To serve your rapines; my lord long away,"
15909,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And you allow’d no colour for your stay
15910,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But his still absence; striving who shall frame
15911,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Me for his wife; and, since ’tis made a game,"
15912,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I here propose divine Ulysses’ bow
15913,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For that great master-piece to which ye vow.
15914,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He that can draw it with least show to strive,"
15915,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And through these twelve axe-heads an arrow drive,"
15916,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Him will I follow, and this house forego"
15917,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That nourish’d me a maid, now furnish’d so"
15918,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all things fit, and which I so esteem"
15919,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That I shall still live in it in my dream.”
15920,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, she made Eumæus give it them."
15921,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He took and laid it by, and wept for woe;"
15922,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And like him wept Philœtius, when the bow"
15923,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of which his king was bearer he beheld.
15924,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their tears Antinous’ manhood much refell’d,"
15925,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And said: “Ye rustic fools! that still each day
15926,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your minds give over to this vain dismay,"
15927,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Why weep ye, wretches, and the widow’s eyes"
15928,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tempt with renew’d thought, that would otherwise"
15929,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Depose her sorrows, since her lord is dead,"
15930,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And tears are idle? Sit, and eat your bread,"
15931,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor whisper more a word; or get ye gone,"
15932,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And weep without doors. Let this bow alone
15933,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To our out-match’d contention. For I fear
15934,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The bow will scarce yield draught to any here;
15935,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Here no such man lives as Laertes’ son
15936,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amongst us all. I knew him; thought puts on
15937,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His look’s sight now, methinks, though then a child.”"
15938,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus show’d his words doubt, yet his hopes instill’d"
15939,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His strength the stretcher of Ulysses’ string,"
15940,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And his steels’ piercer. But his shaft must sing
15941,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Through his pierc’d palate first; whom so he wrong’d
15942,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his free roof, and made the rest ill-tongued"
15943,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Against his virtues. Then the sacred heat
15944,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That spirited his son did further set
15945,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their confidence on fire, and said: “O friends,"
15946,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove hath bereft my wits. The Queen intends,"
15947,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though I must grant her wise, ere long to leave"
15948,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses’ court, and to her bed receive"
15949,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some other lord; yet, notwithstanding, I"
15950,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Am forc’d to laugh, and set my pleasures high"
15951,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like one mad sick. But, Wooers, since ye have"
15952,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"An object for your trials now so brave,"
15953,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As all the broad Achaian earth exceeds,"
15954,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As sacred Pylos, as the Argive breeds,"
15955,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As black Epirus, as Mycena’s birth,"
15956,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as the more fam’d Ithacensian earth,"
15957,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All which, yourselves well know, and oft have said—"
15958,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For what need hath my mother of my aid
15959,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In her advancement?—tender no excuse
15960,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For least delay, nor too much time profuse"
15961,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In stay to draw this bow, but draw it straight,"
15962,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shoot, and the steels pierce; make all see how slight"
15963,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,You make these poor bars to so rich a prize.
15964,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,No eag’rer yet? Come all. My faculties
15965,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall try the bow’s strength, and the piercéd steel."
15966,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I will not for my rev’rend mother feel
15967,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sorrows that I know will seize my heart,"
15968,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To see her follow any, and depart"
15969,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From her so long-held home; but first extend
15970,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The bow and arrow to their tender’d end.
15971,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For I am only to succeed my sire
15972,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In guard of his games, and let none aspire"
15973,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To their besides possession.” This said,"
15974,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His purple robe he cast off; by he laid
15975,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His well-edg’d sword; and, first, a sev’ral pit"
15976,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He digg’d for ev’ry axe, and strengthen’d it"
15977,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With earth close ramm’d about it; on a rew
15978,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Set them, of one height, by a line he drew"
15979,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Along the whole twelve; and so orderly
15980,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Did ev’ry deed belonging (yet his eye
15981,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Never before beholding how ’twas done)
15982,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That in amaze rose all his lookers-on.
15983,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then stood he near the door, and prov’d to draw"
15984,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The stubborn bow. Thrice tried, and thrice gave law"
15985,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To his uncrown’d attempts; the fourth assay
15986,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all force off’ring, which a sign gave stay"
15987,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Giv’n by his father; though he show’d a mind
15988,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As if he stood right heartily inclin’d
15989,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To perfect the exploit, when all was done"
15990,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In only drift to set the Wooers on.
15991,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His weakness yet confess’d, he said: “O shame!"
15992,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I either shall be ever of no name,"
15993,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But prove a wretch; or else I am too young,"
15994,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And must not now presume on pow’rs so strong
15995,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As sinews yet more growing may engraft,"
15996,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To turn a man quite over with a shaft.
15997,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Besides, to men whose nerves are best prepar’d,"
15998,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,_All great adventures at first proof are hard._
15999,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But come, you stronger men, attempt this bow,"
16000,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And let us end our labour.” Thus, below"
16001,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A well-join’d board he laid it, and close by"
16002,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The brightly-headed shaft; then thron’d his thigh
16003,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amidst his late-left seat. Antinous then
16004,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bade all arise; but first, who did sustain"
16005,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The cup’s state ever, and did sacrifice"
16006,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before they ate still, and that man bade rise,"
16007,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since on the other’s right hand he was plac’d,"
16008,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Because he held the right hand’s rising, grac’d"
16009,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With best success still. This discretion won
16010,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Supreme applause; and first rose Œnops’ son,"
16011,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Liodes, that was priest to all the rest,"
16012,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sat lowest with the cup still, and their jest"
16013,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Could never like, but ever was the man"
16014,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That check’d their follies; and he now began
16015,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To taste the bow, the sharp shaft took, tugg’d hard,"
16016,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And held aloft, and, till he quite had marr’d"
16017,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His delicate tender fingers, could not stir"
16018,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The churlish string; who therefore did refer
16019,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The game to others, saying, that same bow,"
16020,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his presage, would prove the overthrow"
16021,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of many a chief man there; nor thought the fate
16022,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was any whit austere, since death’s short date"
16023,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were much the better taken, than long life"
16024,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Without the object of their amorous strife,"
16025,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For whom they had burn’d-out so many days
16026,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To find still other, nothing but delays"
16027,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Obtaining in them; and affirm’d that now
16028,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some hop’d to have her, but when that tough bow"
16029,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They all had tried, and seen the utmost done,"
16030,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They must rest pleas’d to cease; and now some one
16031,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all their other fair-veil’d Grecian dames
16032,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With gifts, and dower, and Hymeneal flames,"
16033,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let her love light to him that most will give,"
16034,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And whom the nuptial destiny did drive.
16035,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus laid he on the well-join’d polish’d board
16036,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The bow and bright-pil’d shaft, and then restor’d"
16037,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His seat his right. To him Antinous
16038,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Gave bitter language, and reprov’d him thus:"
16039,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“What words, Liodes, pass thy speech’s guard,"
16040,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That ’tis a work to bear, and set so hard"
16041,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They set up my disdain! This bow must end
16042,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The best of us? Since thy arms cannot lend
16043,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The string least motion? Thy mother’s throes
16044,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Brought never forth thy arms to draught of bows,"
16045,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or knitting shafts off. Though thou canst not draw
16046,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sturdy plant, thou art to us no law."
16047,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Melanthius! Light a fire, and set thereat"
16048,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A chair and cushions, and that mass of fat"
16049,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That lies within bring out, that we may set"
16050,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our pages to this bow, to see it het"
16051,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And suppled with the suet, and then we"
16052,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"May give it draught, and pay this great decree"
16053,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Utmost performance.” He a mighty fire
16054,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Gave instant flame, put into act th’ entire"
16055,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Command laid on him, chair and cushions set,"
16056,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Laid on the bow, which straight the pages het,"
16057,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Chaf’d, suppled with the suet to their most;"
16058,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And still was all their unctuous labour lost,"
16059,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All Wooers’ strengths too indigent and poor
16060,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To draw that bow; Antinous’ arms it tore,"
16061,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And great Eurymachus’, the both clear best,"
16062,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet both it tir’d, and made them glad to rest."
16063,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Forth then went both the swains, and after them"
16064,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Divine Ulysses; when, being past th’ extreme"
16065,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the gates, with winning words he tried"
16066,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their loves, and this ask’d: “Shall my counsels hide"
16067,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their depths from you? My mind would gladly know
16068,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,If suddenly Ulysses had his vow
16069,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made good for home, and had some God to guide"
16070,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His steps and strokes to wreak these Wooers’ pride,"
16071,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would your aids join on his part, or with theirs?"
16072,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,How stand your hearts affected?” They made pray’rs
16073,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That some God would please to return their lord,"
16074,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He then should see how far they would afford
16075,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their lives for his. He, seeing their truth, replied;"
16076,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“I am your lord, through many a suff’rance tried,"
16077,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Arriv’d now here, whom twenty years have held"
16078,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From forth my country. Yet are not conceal’d
16079,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From my sure knowledge your desires to see
16080,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My safe return. Of all the company
16081,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now serving here besides, not one but you"
16082,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Mine ear hath witness’d willing to bestow
16083,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their wishes of my life, so long held dead."
16084,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I therefore vow, which shall be perfected,"
16085,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That if God please beneath my hand to leave
16086,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These Wooers lifeless, ye shall both receive"
16087,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wives from that hand, and means, and near to me"
16088,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Have houses built to you, and both shall be"
16089,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As friends and brothers to my only son.
16090,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, that ye well may know me, and be won"
16091,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To that assurance, the infallible sign"
16092,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The white-tooth’d boar gave, this mark’d knee of mine,"
16093,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When in Parnassus he was held in chase
16094,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By me, and by my famous grandsire’s race,"
16095,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I’ll let you see.” Thus sever’d he his weed
16096,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From that his wound; and ev’ry word had deed
16097,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In their sure knowledges. Which made them cast
16098,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their arms about him, his broad breast embrac’d,"
16099,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His neck and shoulders kiss’d. And him as well
16100,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Did those true pow’rs of human love compell
16101,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To kiss their heads and hands, and to their moan"
16102,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had sent the free light of the cheerful sun,"
16103,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had not Ulysses broke the ruth, and said;"
16104,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Cease tears and sorrows, lest we prove display’d"
16105,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By some that issue from the house, and they"
16106,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Relate to those within. Take each his way,"
16107,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not altogether in, but one by one,"
16108,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"First I, then you; and then see this be done;"
16109,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The envious Wooers will by no means give
16110,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The offer of the bow and arrow leave
16111,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To come at me; spite then their pride, do thou,"
16112,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My good Eumæus, bring both shaft and bow"
16113,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To my hand’s proof; and charge the maids before
16114,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That instantly they shut in ev’ry door,"
16115,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That they themselves (if any tumult rise
16116,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Beneath my roofs by any that envies
16117,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My will to undertake the game) may gain
16118,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No passage forth, but close at work contain"
16119,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all free quiet, or at least constrain’d,"
16120,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore, my Philœtius, see maintain’d,"
16121,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When close the gates are shut, their closure fast,"
16122,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To which end be it thy sole work to cast
16123,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their chains before them.” This said, in he led,"
16124,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Took first his seat; and then they seconded
16125,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His entry with their own. Then took in hand
16126,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eurymachus the bow, made close his stand"
16127,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Aside the fire, at whose heat here and there"
16128,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He warm’d and suppled it, yet could not stere"
16129,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To any draught the string, with all his art;"
16130,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore swell’d in him his glorious heart,"
16131,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Affirming, “that himself and all his friends"
16132,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had cause to grieve, not only that their ends"
16133,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They miss’d in marriage, since enough besides"
16134,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Kind Grecian dames there liv’d to be their brides
16135,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In Ithaca, and other bord’ring towns,"
16136,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But that to all times future their renowns
16137,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would stand disparag’d, if Ulysses’ bow"
16138,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They could not draw, and yet his wife would woo.”"
16139,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Antinous answer’d; “That there could ensue
16140,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,No shame at all to them; for well he knew
16141,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That this day was kept holy to the Sun
16142,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By all the city, and there should be done"
16143,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No such profane act, therefore bade lay by"
16144,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The bow for that day; but the mastery
16145,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of axes that were set up still might stand,"
16146,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since that no labour was, nor any hand"
16147,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would offer to invade Ulysses’ house,"
16148,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To take, or touch with surreptitious"
16149,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or violent hand, what there was left for use."
16150,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He, therefore, bade the cup-bearer infuse"
16151,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wine to the bowls, that so with sacrifice"
16152,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They might let rest the shooting exercise,"
16153,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And in the morning make Melanthius bring
16154,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The chief goats of his herd, that to the King"
16155,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of bows and archers they might burn the thighs
16156,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For good success, and then attempt the prize.”"
16157,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The rest sat pleas’d with this. The heralds straight
16158,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Pour’d water on their hands; each page did wait
16159,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With his crown’d cup of wine, serv’d ev’ry man"
16160,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Till all were satisfied. And then began
16161,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ulysses’ plot of his close purpose thus:
16162,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Hear me, ye much renown’d Eurymachus,"
16163,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And king Antinous, in chief, who well,"
16164,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And with decorum sacred, doth compell"
16165,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This day’s observance, and to let lay down"
16166,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The bow all this light, giving Gods their own."
16167,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The morning’s labour God the more will bless,"
16168,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And strength bestow where he himself shall please.
16169,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Against which time let me presume to pray
16170,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your favours with the rest, that this assay"
16171,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"May my old arms prove, trying if there lie"
16172,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In my poor pow’rs the same activity
16173,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That long since crown’d them; or if needy fare
16174,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And desolate wand’ring have the web worn bare
16175,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of my life’s thread at all parts, that no more"
16176,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Can furnish these affairs as heretofore.”
16177,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This het their spleens past measure, blown with fear"
16178,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Lest his loath’d temples would the garland wear
16179,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of that bow’s draught; Antinous using speech
16180,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To this sour purpose: “Thou most arrant wretch
16181,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all guests breathing, in no least degree"
16182,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Grac’d with a human soul, it serves not thee"
16183,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To feast in peace with us, take equal share"
16184,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of what we reach to, sit, and all things hear"
16185,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That we speak freely,—which no begging guest"
16186,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Did ever yet,—but thou must make request"
16187,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To mix with us in merit of the Queen.
16188,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But wine inflames thee, that hath ever been"
16189,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The bane of men whoever yet would take
16190,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Th’ excess it offers and the mean forsake.
16191,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wine spoil’d the Centaur great Eurytion,"
16192,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In guest-rites with the mighty-minded son
16193,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of bold Ixion, in his way to war"
16194,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against the Lapithes; who, driv’n as far"
16195,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As madness with the bold effects of wine,"
16196,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Did outrage to his kind host, and decline"
16197,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Other heroës from him feasted there
16198,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With so much anger that they left their cheer,"
16199,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And dragg’d him forth the fore-court, slit his nose,"
16200,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cropp’d both his ears, and, in the ill-dispose"
16201,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His mind then suffer’d, drew the fatal day"
16202,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,On his head with his host; for thence the fray
16203,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Betwixt the Centaurs and the Lapithes
16204,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Had mortal act. But he for his excess
16205,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In spoil of wine fared worse himself; as thou
16206,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For thy large cups, if thy arms draw the bow,"
16207,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My mind fortells shalt fear; for not a man
16208,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all our consort, that in wisdom can"
16209,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Boast any fit share, will take prayers then,"
16210,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But to Echetus, the most stern of men,"
16211,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A black sail freight with thee, whose worst of ill,"
16212,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Be sure, is past all ransom. Sit, then, still,"
16213,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Drink temp’rately, and never more contend"
16214,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With men your youngers.” This the Queen did end
16215,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With her defence of him, and told his foe"
16216,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It was not fair nor equal t’ overcrow
16217,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The poorest guest her son pleas’d t’ entertain
16218,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In his free turrets with so proud a strain
16219,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of threats and bravings; asking if he thought,"
16220,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That if the stranger to his arms had brought
16221,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The stubborn bow down, he should marry her,"
16222,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And bear her home? And said, himself should err"
16223,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In no such hope; nor of them all the best
16224,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That griev’d at any good she did her guest
16225,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Should banquet there; since it in no sort show’d
16226,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Noblesse in them, nor paid her what she ow’d"
16227,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her own free rule there. This Eurymachus
16228,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Confirm’d and said: “Nor feeds it hope in us,"
16229,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Icarius’ daughter, to solemnize rites"
16230,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of nuptials with thee; nor in noblest sights
16231,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It can show comely; but to our respects
16232,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The rumour both of sexes and of sects
16233,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the people would breed shame and fear,"
16234,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lest any worst Greek said: ‘See, men that were"
16235,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of mean deservings will presume t’ aspire
16236,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his wife’s bed, whom all men did admire"
16237,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For fame and merit, could not draw his bow,"
16238,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yet his wife had foolish pride to woo,"
16239,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When straight an errant beggar comes and draws
16240,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The bow with ease, performing all the laws"
16241,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The game besides contain’d’; and this would thus
16242,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Prove both indignity and shame to us.”
16243,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Queen replied: “The fame of men, I see,"
16244,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Bears much price in your great suppos’d degree;
16245,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet who can prove amongst the people great,"
16246,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That of one so esteem’d of them the seat
16247,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Doth so defame and ruin? And beside,"
16248,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With what right is this guest thus vilified
16249,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In your high censures, when the man in blood"
16250,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is well compos’d and great, his parents good?[1]"
16251,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore give the bow to him, to try"
16252,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His birth and breeding by his chivalry.
16253,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If his arms draw it, and that Phœbus stands"
16254,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So great a glory to his strength, my hands"
16255,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall add this guerdon: Ev’ry sort of weed,"
16256,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A two-edg’d sword, and lance to keep him freed"
16257,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From dogs and men hereafter, and dismiss"
16258,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His worth to what place tends that heart of his.”
16259,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her son gave answer: “That it was a wrong
16260,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To his free sway in all things that belong
16261,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To guard of that house, to demand the bow"
16262,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of any Wooer, and the use bestow"
16263,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Upon the stranger: for the bow was his
16264,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To give or to withhold; no masteries
16265,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of her proposing giving any pow’r
16266,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"T’ impair his right in things for any Wooer,"
16267,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or any that rough Ithaca affords,"
16268,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Any that Elis; of which no man’s words
16269,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor pow’rs should curb him, stood he so inclin’d,"
16270,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To see the bow in absolute gift resign’d
16271,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To that his guest to bear and use at will,"
16272,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And therefore bade his mother keep her still
16273,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amongst her women at her rock and loom;
16274,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Bows were for men; and this bow did become
16275,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Past all men’s his disposure, since his sire"
16276,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Left it to him, and all the house entire.”"
16277,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She stood dismay’d at this, and in her mind"
16278,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His wise words laid up, standing so inclin’d"
16279,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As he had will’d, with all her women going"
16280,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up to her chamber, there her tears bestowing,"
16281,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As ev’ry night she did, on her lov’d lord,"
16282,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Till sleep and Pallas her fit rest restor’d.
16283,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The bow Eumæus took, and bore away;"
16284,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which up in tumult, and almost in fray,"
16285,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Put all the Wooers, one enquiring thus:"
16286,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Whither, rogue, abject, wilt thou bear from us"
16287,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That bow propos’d? Lay down, or I protest"
16288,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy dogs shall eat thee, that thou nourishest"
16289,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To guard thy swine; amongst whom, left of all,"
16290,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy life shall leave thee, if the festival,"
16291,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We now observe to Phœbus, may our zeals"
16292,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Grace with his aid, and all the Deities else.”"
16293,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This threat made good Eumæus yield the bow
16294,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his late place, not knowing what might grow"
16295,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From such a multitude. And then fell on
16296,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Telemachus with threats, and said: “Set gone"
16297,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That bow yet further; ’tis no servant’s part
16298,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To serve too many masters; raise your heart
16299,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And bear it off, lest, though you’re younger, yet"
16300,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With stones I pelt you to the field with it.
16301,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If you and I close, I shall prove too strong."
16302,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I wish as much too hard for all this throng
16303,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Gods would make me, I should quickly send"
16304,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some after with just sorrow to their end,"
16305,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They waste my victuals so, and ply my cup,"
16306,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And do me such shrewd turns still.” This put up
16307,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Wooers all in laughters, and put down"
16308,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their angers to him, that so late were grown"
16309,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So grave and bloody; which resolv’d that fear
16310,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of good Eumæus, who did take and bear"
16311,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The King the bow; call’d nurse, and bade her make"
16312,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The doors all sure, that if men’s tumults take"
16313,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The ears of some within, they may not fly,"
16314,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But keep at work still close and silently.
16315,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These words put wings to her, and close she put"
16316,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The chamber door. The court-gates then were shut
16317,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By kind Philœtius, who straight did go"
16318,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From out the hall, and in the portico"
16319,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Found laid a gable of a ship, compos’d"
16320,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of spongy bulrushes; with which he clos’d,"
16321,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In winding round about them, the court-gates,"
16322,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then took his place again, to view the fates"
16323,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That quickly follow’d. When he came, he saw"
16324,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses viewing, ere he tried to draw,"
16325,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The famous bow, which ev’ry way he mov’d,"
16326,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Up and down turning it; in which be prov’d
16327,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The plight it was in, fearing, chiefly, lest"
16328,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The horns were eat with worms in so long rest.
16329,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But what his thoughts intended turning so,"
16330,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And keeping such a search about the bow,"
16331,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Wooers little knowing fell to jest,"
16332,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And said: “Past doubt he is a man profest
16333,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In bowyers’ craft, and sees quite through the wood;"
16334,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or something, certain, to be understood"
16335,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,There is in this his turning of it still.
16336,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A cunning rogue he is at any ill.”
16337,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then spake another proud one: “Would to heav’n,"
16338,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I might, at will, get gold till he hath giv’n"
16339,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That bow his draught!” With these sharp jests did these
16340,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Delightsome Woo’rs their fatal humours please.
16341,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But when the wise Ulysses once had laid
16342,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His fingers on it, and to proof survey’d"
16343,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The still sound plight it held, as one of skill"
16344,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In song, and of the harp, doth at his will,"
16345,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In tuning of his instrument, extend"
16346,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A string out with his pin, touch all, and lend"
16347,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To ev’ry well-wreath’d string his perfect sound,"
16348,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Struck all together; with such ease drew round
16349,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The King the bow. Then twang’d he up the string,"
16350,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That as a swallow in the air doth sing
16351,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With no continued tune, but, pausing still,"
16352,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Twinks out her scatter’d voice in accents shrill;
16353,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So sharp the string sung when he gave it touch,"
16354,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Once having bent and drawn it. Which so much
16355,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amaz’d the Wooers, that their colours went"
16356,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And came most grievously. And then Jove rent
16357,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The air with thunder; which at heart did cheer
16358,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The now-enough-sustaining traveller,"
16359,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That Jove again would his attempt enable.
16360,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then took he into hand, from off the table,"
16361,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The first drawn arrow: and a number more
16362,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Spent shortly on the Wooers; but this one
16363,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He measur’d by his arm, as if not known"
16364,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The length were to him, nock’d it then, and drew;"
16365,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And through the axes, at the first hole, flew"
16366,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The steel-charg’d arrow; which when he had done
16367,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He thus bespake the Prince: “You have not won
16368,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Disgrace yet by your guest; for I have strook
16369,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The mark I shot at, and no such toil took"
16370,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In wearying the bow with fat and fire
16371,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As did the Wooers. Yet reserv’d entire,"
16372,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thank Heav’n, my strength is, and myself am tried,"
16373,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,No man to be so basely vilified
16374,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As these men pleas’d to think me. But, free way"
16375,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Take that, and all their pleasures; and while day"
16376,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Holds her torch to you, and the hour of feast"
16377,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hath now full date, give banquet, and the rest,"
16378,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Poem and harp, that grace a well-fill’d board.”"
16379,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he beckon’d to his son; whose sword"
16380,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He straight girt to him, took to hand his lance,"
16381,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And cómplete-arm’d did to his sire advance.

16402,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The end of pride,"
16403,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And lawless lust,"
16404,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Is wretched tried
16405,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With slaughters just.
16406,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
16407,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The upper rags that wise Ulysses wore
16408,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cast off, he rusheth to the great hall door"
16409,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With bow and quiver full of shafts, which down"
16410,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He pour’d before his feet, and thus made known"
16411,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His true state to the Wooers: “This strife thus
16412,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Hath harmless been decided; now for us
16413,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There rests another mark, more hard to hit,"
16414,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And such as never man before hath smit;
16415,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose full point likewise my hands shall assay,"
16416,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And try if Phœbus will give me his day.”
16417,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He said, and off his bitter arrow thrust"
16418,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Right at Antinous; and struck him just
16419,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As he was lifting up the bowl, to show"
16420,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That ’twixt the cup and lip much ill may grow.
16421,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Death touch’d not at his thoughts at feast; for who
16422,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Would think that he alone could perish so
16423,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst so many, and he best of all?"
16424,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The arrow in his throat took full his fall,"
16425,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And thrust his head far through the other side.
16426,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Down fell his cup, down he, down all his pride;"
16427,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Straight from his nostrils gush’d the human gore;
16428,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, as he fell, his feet far overbore"
16429,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The feastful table; all the roast and bread
16430,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About the house strew’d. When his high-born head
16431,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The rest beheld so low, up rush’d they all,"
16432,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And ransack’d ev’ry corner of the hall
16433,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For shields and darts; but all fled far their reach.
16434,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then fell they foul on him with terrible speech,"
16435,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And told him it should prove the dearest shaft
16436,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That ever pass’d him; and that now was saft
16437,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No shift for him, but sure and sudden death;"
16438,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For he had slain a man, whose like did breathe"
16439,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In no part of the kingdom; and that now
16440,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He should no more for games strive with his bow,"
16441,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But vultures eat him there. These threats they spent,"
16442,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Yet ev’ry man believ’d that stern event
16443,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Chanc’d ’gainst the author’s will. O fools, to think"
16444,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That all their rest had any cup to drink
16445,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But what their great Antinous began!
16446,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He, frowning, said: “Dogs, see in me the man"
16447,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ye all held dead at Troy. My house it is
16448,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That thus ye spoil, and thus your luxuries"
16449,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,File with my women’s rapes; in which ye woo
16450,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The wife of one that lives, and no thought show"
16451,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of man’s fit fear, or God’s, your present fame,"
16452,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or any fair sense of your future name;
16453,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, therefore, present and eternal death"
16454,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Shall end your base life.” This made fresh fears breathe
16455,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their former boldness. Ev’ry man had eye
16456,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On all the means, and studied ways to fly"
16457,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So deep deaths imminent. But seeing none,"
16458,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Eurymachus began with suppliant moan
16459,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To move his pity, saying: “If you be"
16460,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This isle’s Ulysses, we must all agree,"
16461,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In grant of your reproof’s integrity,"
16462,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Greeks have done you many a wrong at home,"
16463,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,At field as many. But of all the sum
16464,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Lies here contract in death; for only he
16465,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Impos’d the whole ill-offices that we
16466,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Are now made guilty of, and not so much"
16467,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sought his endeavours, or in thought did touch"
16468,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At any nuptials, but a greater thing"
16469,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Employ’d his forces; for to be our king
16470,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was his chief object; his sole plot it was
16471,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To kill your son, which Jove’s hand would not pass,"
16472,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But set it to his own most merited end.
16473,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In which end your just anger, nor extend"
16474,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your stern wreak further; spend your royal pow’rs
16475,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In mild ruth of your people; we are yours;
16476,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And whatsoever waste of wine or food
16477,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our liberties have made, we’ll make all good"
16478,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In restitutions. Call a court, and pass"
16479,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A fine of twenty oxen, gold, and brass,"
16480,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On ev’ry head, and raise your most rates still,"
16481,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Till you are pleas’d with your confesséd fill.
16482,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which if we fail to tender, all your wrath"
16483,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It shall be justice in our bloods to bathe.”
16484,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Eurymachus,” said he, “if you would give"
16485,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All that your fathers’ hoard, to make ye live,"
16486,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all that ever you yourselves possess,"
16487,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or shall by any industry increase,"
16488,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I would not cease from slaughter, till your bloods"
16489,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Had bought out your intemp’rance in my goods.
16490,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It rests now for you that you either fight
16491,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That will ’scape death, or make your way by flight."
16492,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In whose best choice, my thoughts conceive, not one"
16493,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Shall shun the death your first hath undergone.”
16494,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This quite dissolv’d their knees. Eurymachus,"
16495,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Enforcing all their fears, yet counsell’d thus:"
16496,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O friends! This man, now he hath got the bow"
16497,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And quiver by him, ever will bestow"
16498,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His most inaccessible hands at us,"
16499,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And never leave, if we avoid him thus,"
16500,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Till he hath strewn the pavement with us all;
16501,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, therefore, join we swords, and on him fall"
16502,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With tables forc’d up, and borne in oppos’d"
16503,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against his sharp shafts; when, being round-enclos’d"
16504,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By all our onsets, we shall either take"
16505,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His horrid person, or for safety make"
16506,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His rage retire from out the hall and gates;
16507,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then, if he escape, we’ll make our states"
16508,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Known to the city by our gen’ral cry.
16509,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And thus this man shall let his last shaft fly
16510,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That ever his hand vaunted.” Thus he drew
16511,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His sharp-edg’d sword; and with a table flew
16512,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In on Ulysses, with a terrible throat"
16513,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His fierce charge urging. But Ulysses smote
16514,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The board, and cleft it through from end to end"
16515,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Borne at his breast; and made his shaft extend
16516,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His sharp head to his liver, his broad breast"
16517,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Pierc’d at his nipple; when his hand releast
16518,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Forthwith his sword, that fell and kiss’d the ground,"
16519,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With cups and victuals lying scatter’d round
16520,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About the pavement; amongst which his brow
16521,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Knock’d the imbrued earth, while in pains did flow"
16522,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His vital spirits, till his heels shook out"
16523,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His feastful life, and hurl’d a throne about"
16524,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That way-laid death’s convulsions in his feet;
16525,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When from his tender eyes the light did fleet.
16526,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then charg’d Amphinomus with his drawn blade
16527,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The glorious king, in purpose to have made"
16528,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His feet forsake the house; but his assay
16529,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The prince prevented, and his lance gave way"
16530,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Quite through his shoulder, at his back; his breast"
16531,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The fierce pile letting forth. His ruin prest
16532,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Groans from the pavement, which his forehead strook."
16533,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Telemachus his long lance then forsook—
16534,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Left in Amphinomus—and to his sire
16535,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made fiery pass, not staying to acquire"
16536,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His lance again, in doubt that, while he drew"
16537,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fixéd pile, some other might renew"
16538,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fierce charge upon him, and his unharm’d head"
16539,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Cleave with his back-drawn sword; for which he fled
16540,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Close to his father, bade him arm, and he"
16541,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would bring him shield and jav’lins instantly,"
16542,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His own head arming, more arms laying by"
16543,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To serve the swine-herd and the oxen-herd.
16544,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,_Valour well arm’d is ever most preferr’d._
16545,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Run then,” said he, “and come before the last"
16546,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of these auxiliary shafts are past,"
16547,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For fear, lest, left alone, they force my stand"
16548,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From forth the ports.” He flew, and brought to hand"
16549,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eight darts, four shields, four helms. His own parts then"
16550,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"First put in arms, he furnish’d both his men,"
16551,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That to their king stood close; but he, as long"
16552,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As he had shafts to friend, enough was strong"
16553,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For all the Wooers, and some one man still"
16554,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He made make even with earth, till all a hill"
16555,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had rais’d in th’ even-floor’d hall. His last shaft spent,"
16556,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He set his bow against a beam, and went"
16557,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To arm at all parts, while the other three"
16558,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Kept off the Wooers, who, unarm’d, could be"
16559,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,No great assailants. In the well-built wall
16560,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A window was thrust out, at end of all"
16561,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The house’s entry; on whose utter side
16562,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There lay a way to town, and in it wide"
16563,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And two-leav’d folds were forg’d, that gave fit mean"
16564,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For flyers-out; and, therefore, at it then"
16565,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ulysses plac’d Eumæus in close guard;
16566,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One only pass ope to it, which (prepar’d"
16567,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In this sort by Ulysses ’gainst all pass)
16568,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By Agelaus’ tardy memory was
16569,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In question call’d, who bade some one ascend"
16570,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At such a window, and bring straight to friend"
16571,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The city with his clamour, that this man"
16572,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Might quickly shoot his last. “This no one can
16573,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Make safe access to,” said Melanthius,"
16574,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“For ’tis too near the hall’s fair doors, whence thus"
16575,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The man afflicts ye; for from thence there lies
16576,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But one strait passage to it, that denies"
16577,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Access to all, if any one man stand,"
16578,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Being one of courage, and will countermand"
16579,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our offer to it. But I know a way
16580,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To bring you arms, from where the King doth lay"
16581,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His whole munition; and believe there is
16582,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,No other place to all the armories
16583,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both of himself and son.” This said, a pair"
16584,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of lofty stairs he climb’d, and to th’ affair"
16585,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Twelve shields, twelve lances brought, as many casques"
16586,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With horsehair plumes; and set to bitter tasks
16587,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both son and sire. Then shrunk Ulysses’ knees,"
16588,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And his lov’d heart, when thus in arms he sees"
16589,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So many Wooers, and their shaken darts;"
16590,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For then the work show’d as it ask’d more parts
16591,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To safe performance, and he told his son"
16592,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That or Melanthius or his maids had done
16593,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A deed that foul war to their hands conferr’d.
16594,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O father,” he replied, “’tis I have err’d"
16595,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In this caus’d labour; I, and none but I,"
16596,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That left the door ope of your armoury.
16597,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But some, it seems, hath set a sharper eye"
16598,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,On that important place. Eumæus! Haste
16599,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And shut the door, observing who hath past"
16600,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To this false action; any maid, or one"
16601,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That I suspect more, which is Dolius’ son.”"
16602,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"While these spake thus, Melanthius went again"
16603,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For more fair arms; when the renownéd swain
16604,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eumæus saw, and told Ulysses straight"
16605,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It was the hateful man that his conceit
16606,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before suspected, who had done that ill;"
16607,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, being again there, ask’d if he should kill,"
16608,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If his pow’r serv’d, or he should bring the swain"
16609,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To him, t’ inflict on him a sev’ral pain"
16610,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For ev’ry forfeit he had made his house.
16611,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He answer’d: “I and my Telemachus
16612,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will here contain these proud ones in despite,"
16613,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,How much soever these stol’n arms excite
16614,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their guilty courages, while you two take"
16615,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Possession of the chamber. The doors make
16616,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sure at your back, and then, surprising him,"
16617,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His feet and hands bind, wrapping ev’ry limb"
16618,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In pliant chains; and with a halter cast
16619,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Above the wind-beam—at himself made fast—
16620,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Aloft the column draw him; where alive
16621,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He long may hang, and pains enough deprive"
16622,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His vexéd life before his death succeed.”
16623,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This charge, soon heard, as soon they put to deed,"
16624,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stole on his stealth, and at the further end"
16625,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all the chamber saw him busily bend
16626,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His hands to more arms, when they, still at door,"
16627,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Watch’d his return. At last he came, and bore"
16628,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In one hand a fair helm, in th’ other held"
16629,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A broad and ancient rusty-rested shield,"
16630,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That old Laertes in his youth had worn,"
16631,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of which the cheek-bands had with age been torn.
16632,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They rush’d upon him, caught him by the hair,"
16633,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And dragg’d him in again; whom, crying out,"
16634,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They cast upon the pavement, wrapp’d about"
16635,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With sure and pinching cords both foot and hand,"
16636,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then, in full act of their King’s command,"
16637,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A pliant chain bestow’d on him, and hal’d"
16638,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His body up the column, till he scal’d"
16639,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The highest wind-beam; where made firmly fast,"
16640,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Eumæus on his just infliction past
16641,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This pleasurable cavil: “Now you may
16642,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All night keep watch here, and the earliest day"
16643,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Discern, being hung so high, to rouse from rest"
16644,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your dainty cattle to the Wooers’ feast.
16645,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There, as befits a man of means so fair,"
16646,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Soft may you sleep, nought under you but air;"
16647,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And so long hang you.” Thus they left him there,"
16648,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made fast the door, and with Ulysses were"
16649,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All arm’d in th’ instant. Then they all stood close,"
16650,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their minds fire breath’d in flames against their foes,"
16651,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Four in th’ entry fighting all alone;
16652,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When from the hall charg’d many a mighty one.
16653,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But to them then Jove’s seed, Minerva, came,"
16654,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Resembling Mentor both in voice and frame
16655,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of manly person. Passing well apaid
16656,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses was, and said: “Now, Mentor, aid"
16657,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,’Gainst these odd mischiefs; call to memory now
16658,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My often good to thee, and that we two"
16659,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of one year’s life are.” Thus he said, but thought"
16660,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"ft was Minerva, that had ever brought"
16661,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To her side safety. On the other part,"
16662,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Wooers threaten’d; but the chief in heart
16663,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was Agelaus, who to Mentor spake:"
16664,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“Mentor! Let no words of Ulysses make
16665,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy hand a fighter on his feeble side
16666,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,‘Gainst all us Wooers; for we firm abide
16667,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In this persuasion, that when sire and son"
16668,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our swords have slain, thy life is sure to run"
16669,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,One fortune with them. What strange acts hast thou
16670,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Conceit to form here? Thy head must bestow
16671,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The wreak of theirs on us. And when thy pow’rs
16672,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Are taken down by these fierce steels of ours,"
16673,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All thy possessions, in-doors and without,"
16674,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Must raise on heap with his; and all thy rout
16675,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of sons and daughters in thy turrets bleed
16676,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Wreak off’rings to us; and our town stand freed
16677,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all charge with thy wife.” Minerva’s heart
16678,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was fir’d with these braves, the approv’d desert"
16679,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of her Ulysses chiding, saying: “No more"
16680,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy force nor fortitude as heretofore
16681,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Will gain thee glory; when nine years at Troy
16682,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,White-wristed Helen’s rescue did employ
16683,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy arms and wisdom, still and ever us’d,"
16684,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The bloods of thousands through the field diffus’d
16685,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By thy vast valour; Priam’s broad-way’d town
16686,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By thy grave parts was sack’d and overthrown;
16687,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And now, amongst thy people and thy goods,"
16688,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Against the Wooers’ base and petulant bloods
16689,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Stint’st thou thy valour? Rather mourning here
16690,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Than manly fighting? Come, friend, stand we near,"
16691,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And note my labour, that thou may’st discern"
16692,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amongst thy foes how Mentor’s nerves will earn
16693,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All thy old bounties.” This she spake, but stay’d"
16694,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her hand from giving each-way-often-sway’d
16695,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Uncertain conquest to his certain use,"
16696,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But still would try what self-pow’rs would produce
16697,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Both in the father and the glorious son.
16698,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then on the wind-beam that along did ron
16699,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The smoky roof, transform’d, Minerva sat,"
16700,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Like to a swallow; sometimes cuffing at
16701,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The swords and lances, rushing from her seat,"
16702,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And up and down the troubl’d house did beat
16703,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her wing at ev’ry motion. And as she
16704,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Had rous’d Ulysses; so the enemy
16705,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Damastor’s son excited, Polybus,"
16706,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amphinomus, and Demoptolemus,"
16707,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eurynomus, and Polyctorides;"
16708,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For these were men that of the wooing prease
16709,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were most egregious, and the clearly best"
16710,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In strength of hand of all the desp’rate rest
16711,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That yet surviv’d, and now fought for their souls;"
16712,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which straight swift arrows sent among the fowls.
16713,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But first, Damastor’s son had more spare breath"
16714,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To spend on their excitements ere his death,"
16715,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And said: That now Ulysses would forbear
16716,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His dismal hand, since Mentor’s spirit was there,"
16717,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And blew vain vaunts about Ulysses’ ears;
16718,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In whose trust he would cease his massacres,"
16719,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rest him, and put his friend’s huge boasts in proof;"
16720,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And so was he beneath the entry’s roof
16721,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Left with Telemachus and th’ other two.
16722,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“At whom,” said he, “discharge no darts, but throw"
16723,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All at Ulysses, rousing his faint rest;"
16724,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom if we slaughter, by our interest"
16725,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In Jove’s assistance, all the rest may yield"
16726,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our pow’rs no care, when he strews once the field.”"
16727,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As he then will’d, they all at random threw"
16728,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Where they suppos’d he rested; and then flew
16729,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Minerva after ev’ry dart, and made"
16730,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some strike the threshold, some the walls invade,"
16731,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some beat the doors, and all acts render’d vain"
16732,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their grave steel offer’d. Which escap’d, again"
16733,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Came on Ulysses, saying: “O that we"
16734,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Wooers’ troop with our joint archery
16735,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Might so assail, that where their spirits dream"
16736,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On our deaths first, we first may slaughter them!”"
16737,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus the much-suff’rer said; and all let-fly,"
16738,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When ev’ry man struck dead his enemy.
16739,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ulysses slaughter’d Demoptolemus.
16740,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Euryades by young Telemachus
16741,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His death encounter’d. Good Eumæus slew
16742,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Elatus. And Philœtius overthrew
16743,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Pisander. All which tore the pavéd floor
16744,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Up with their teeth. The rest retir’d before
16745,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their second charge to inner rooms; and then
16746,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ulysses follow’d; from the slaughter’d men
16747,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their darts first drawing. While which work was done,"
16748,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Wooers threw with huge contention
16749,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To kill them all; when with her swallow-wing
16750,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Minerva cuff’d, and made their jav’lins ring"
16751,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against the doors and thresholds, as before."
16752,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Some yet did graze upon their marks. One tore
16753,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The prince’s wrist, which was Amphimedon,"
16754,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Th’ extreme part of the skin but touch’d upon.
16755,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ctesippus over good Eumeeus’ shield
16756,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His shoulder’s top did taint; which yet did yield
16757,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The lance free pass, and gave his hurt the ground."
16758,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Again then charg’d the Wooers, and girt round"
16759,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses with their lances; who turn’d head,"
16760,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And with his jav’lin struck Eurydamas dead.
16761,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Telemachus disliv’d Amphimedon;
16762,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eumæus, Polybus; Philœtius won"
16763,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ctesippus’ bosom with his dart, and said,"
16764,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In quittance of the jester’s part he play’d,"
16765,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The neat’s foot hurling at Ulysses: “Now,"
16766,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Great son of Polytherses, you that vow"
16767,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your wit to bitter taunts, and love to wound"
16768,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The heart of any with a jest, so crown’d"
16769,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your wit be with a laughter, never yielding"
16770,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To fools in folly, but your glory building"
16771,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On putting down in fooling, spitting forth"
16772,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Puff’d words at all sorts, cease to scoff at worth,"
16773,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And leave revenge of vile words to the Gods,"
16774,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since their wits bear the sharper edge by odds;
16775,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, in the mean time, take the dart I drave,"
16776,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For that right hospitable foot you gave
16777,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Divine Ulysses, begging but his own.”"
16778,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus spake the black-ox-herdsman; and straight down
16779,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ulysses struck another with his dart—
16780,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Damastor’s son. Telemachus did part,"
16781,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Just in the midst, the belly of the fair"
16782,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Evenor’s son; his fierce pile taking air
16783,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Out at his back. Flat fell he on his face,"
16784,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His whole brows knocking, and did mark the place."
16785,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And now man-slaught’ring Pallas took in hand
16786,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her snake-fring’d shield, and on that beam took stand"
16787,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In her true form, where swallow-like she sat."
16788,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then, in this way of the house and that,"
16789,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Wooers, wounded at the heart with fear,"
16790,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Fled the encounter; as in pastures where
16791,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fat herds of oxen feed, about the field"
16792,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(As if wild madness their instincts impell’d)
16793,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The high-fed bullocks fly, whom in the spring,"
16794,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When days are long, gad-bees or breezes sting."
16795,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses and his son the flyers chas’d,"
16796,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As when, with crooked beaks and seres, a cast"
16797,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of hill-bred eagles, cast-off at some game,"
16798,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That yet their strengths keep, but, put up, in flame"
16799,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The eagle stoops; from which, along the field"
16800,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The poor fowls make wing, this and that way yield"
16801,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their hard-flown pinions, then the clouds assay"
16802,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For ’scape or shelter, their forlorn dismay"
16803,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All spirit exhaling, all wings’ strength to carry"
16804,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their bodies forth, and, truss’d up, to the quarry"
16805,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their falconers ride-in, and rejoice to see"
16806,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their hawks perform a flight so fervently;
16807,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So, in their flight, Ulysses with his heir"
16808,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Did stoop and cuff the Wooers, that the air"
16809,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Broke in vast sighs, whose heads they shot and cleft,"
16810,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The pavement boiling with the souls they reft.
16811,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Liodes, running to Ulysses, took"
16812,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His knees, and thus did on his name invoke;"
16813,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“Ulysses! Let me pray thee to my place
16814,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Afford the rev’rence, and to me the grace;"
16815,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That never did or said, to any dame"
16816,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy court contain’d, or deed, or word to blame;"
16817,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But others so affected I have made
16818,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I lay down their insolence; and, if the trade"
16819,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They kept with wickedness have made them still
16820,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Despise my speech, and use their wonted ill,"
16821,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They have their penance by the stroke of death,"
16822,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which their desert divinely warranteth.
16823,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But I am priest amongst them, and shall I"
16824,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That nought have done worth death amongst them die?
16825,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From thee this proverb then will men derive:
16826,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,_Good turns do never their mere deeds survive.”_
16827,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He, bending his displeaséd forehead, said:"
16828,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“If you be priest among them, as you plead,"
16829,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet you would marry, and with my wife too,"
16830,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And have descent by her. For all that woo
16831,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wish to obtain, which they should never do,"
16832,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Dames’ husbands living. You must therefore pray
16833,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of force, and oft in Court here, that the day"
16834,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of my return for him might never shine;
16835,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The death to me wish’d, therefore, shall be thine.”"
16836,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he took a sword up that was cast"
16837,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From Agelaus, having struck his last,"
16838,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And on the priest’s mid neck he laid a stroke
16839,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That struck his head off, tumbling as he spoke."
16840,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then did the poet Phemius (whose surname
16841,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was call’d Terpiades; who thither came
16842,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Forc’d by the Wooers) fly death; but being near
16843,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The court’s great gate, he stood, and parted there"
16844,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In two his counsels; either to remove
16845,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And take the altar of Herceian Jove
16846,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Made sacred to him, with a world of art"
16847,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Engrav’n about it, where were wont t’ impart"
16848,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Laertes and Ulysses many a thigh
16849,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of broad-brow’d oxen to the Deity)
16850,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or venture to Ulysses, clasp his knee,"
16851,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And pray his ruth. The last was the decree
16852,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His choice resolv’d on. ’Twixt the royal throne
16853,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And that fair table that the bowl stood on
16854,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With which they sacrific’d, his harp he laid"
16855,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Along the earth, the King’s knees hugg’d, and said:"
16856,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“Ulysses! Let my pray’rs obtain of thee
16857,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My sacred skill’s respect, and ruth to me!"
16858,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It will hereafter grieve thee to have slain
16859,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A poet, that doth sing to Gods and men."
16860,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I of myself am taught, for God alone"
16861,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All sorts of song hath in my bosom sown,"
16862,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And I, as to a God, will sing to thee;"
16863,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then do not thou deal like the priest with me.
16864,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thine own lov’d son Telemachus will say,"
16865,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That not to beg here, nor with willing way"
16866,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was my access to thy high court addrest,"
16867,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To give the Wooers my song after feast,"
16868,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, being many, and so much more strong,"
16869,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They forced me hither, and compell’d my song.”"
16870,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This did the prince’s sacred virtue hear,"
16871,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And to the King, his father, said: “Forbear"
16872,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To mix the guiltless with the guilty’s blood.
16873,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And with him likewise let our mercies save
16874,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Medon the herald, that did still behave"
16875,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Himself with care of my good from a child;
16876,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If by Eumæus yet he be not kill’d,"
16877,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or by Philœtius, nor your fury met,"
16878,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,While all this blood about the house it swet.”
16879,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This Medon heard, as lying hid beneath"
16880,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A throne set near, half-dead with fear of death;"
16881,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A new-flay’d ox-hide, as but there thrown by,"
16882,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His serious shroud made, he lying there to fly."
16883,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But hearing this he quickly left the throne,"
16884,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His ox-hide cast as quickly, and as soon"
16885,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The prince’s knees seiz’d, saying: “O my love,"
16886,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I am not slain, but here alive and move."
16887,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Abstain yourself, and do not see your sire"
16888,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Quench with my cold blood the unmeasur’d fire
16889,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That flames in his strength, making spoil of me,"
16890,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His wrath’s right, for the Wooers’ injury.”"
16891,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses smil’d, and said: “Be confident"
16892,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This man hath sav’d and made thee different,"
16893,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To let thee know, and say, and others see,"
16894,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,_Good life is much more safe than villany._
16895,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Go then, sit free without from death within."
16896,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This much-renownéd singer from the sin
16897,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of these men likewise quit. Both rest you there,"
16898,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,While I my house purge as it fits me here.”
16899,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, they went and took their seat without"
16900,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At Jove’s high altar, looking round about,"
16901,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Expecting still their slaughter. When the King
16902,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Search’d round the hall, to try life’s hidden wing"
16903,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Made from more death. But all laid prostrate there
16904,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In blood and gore he saw. Whole shoals they were,"
16905,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And lay as thick as in a hollow creek
16906,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Without the white sea, when the fishers break"
16907,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their many-mesh’d draught-net up, there lie"
16908,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fish frisking on the sands, and fain the dry"
16909,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would for the wet change, but th’ all-seeing beam"
16910,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The sun exhales hath suck’d their lives from them;
16911,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So one by other sprawl’d the Wooers there.
16912,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ulysses and his son then bid appear
16913,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The nurse Euryclea, to let her hear"
16914,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His mind in something fit for her affair.
16915,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He op’d the door, and call’d, and said: “Repair,"
16916,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Grave matron long since born, that art our spy"
16917,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To all this house’s servile housewif’ry;
16918,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My father calls thee, to impart some thought"
16919,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That asks thy action.” His word found in nought
16920,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her slack observance, who straight op’d the door"
16921,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And enter’d to him; when himself before
16922,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Had left the hall. But there the King she view’d
16923,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the slain, with blood and gore imbrued."
16924,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as a lion skulking all in night,"
16925,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Far-off in pastures, and come home, all dight"
16926,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In jaws and breast-locks with an ox’s blood
16927,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"New feasted on him, his looks full of mood;"
16928,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So look’d Ulysses, all his hands and feet"
16929,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Freckled with purple. When which sight did greet
16930,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The poor old woman (such works being for eyes
16931,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of no soft temper) out she brake in cries,"
16932,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose vent, though throughly open’d, he yet clos’d,"
16933,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Call’d her more near, and thus her plaints compos’d:"
16934,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Forbear, nor shriek thus, but vent joys as loud."
16935,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"_It is no piety to bemoan the proud,_"
16936,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though ends befall them moving ne’er so much,"
16937,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,These are the portions of the Gods to such.
16938,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,_Men’s own impieties in their instant act
16939,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sustain their plagues, which are with stay but rackt._"
16940,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But these men Gods nor men had in esteem,"
16941,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor good nor bad had any sense in them,"
16942,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their lives directly ill were, therefore, cause"
16943,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That Death in these stern forms so deeply draws.
16944,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Recount, then, to me those licentious dames"
16945,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That lost my honour and their sex’s shames.”
16946,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“I’ll tell you truly,” she replied: “There are"
16947,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Twice five-and-twenty women here that share
16948,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All work amongst them; whom I taught to spin,"
16949,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And bear the just bands that they suffer’d in.
16950,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all which only there were twelve that gave
16951,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Themselves to impudence and light behave,"
16952,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor me respecting, nor herself—the Queen."
16953,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And for your son he hath but lately been
16954,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of years to rule; nor would his mother bear
16955,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His empire where her women’s labours were,"
16956,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But let me go and give her notice now
16957,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of your arrival. Sure some God doth show
16958,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His hand upon her in this rest she takes,"
16959,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That all these uproars bears and never wakes.”
16960,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Nor wake her yet,” said he, “but cause to come"
16961,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Those twelve light women to this utter room.”
16962,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She made all utmost haste to come and go,"
16963,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And bring the women he had summon’d so.
16964,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then both his swains and son he bade go call
16965,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The women to their aid, and clear the hall"
16966,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of those dead bodies, cleanse each board and throne"
16967,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With wetted sponges. Which with fitness done,"
16968,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He bade take all the strumpets ’twixt the wall
16969,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his first court and that room next the hall,"
16970,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In which the vessels of the house were scour’d,"
16971,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And in their bosoms sheath their ev’ry sword,"
16972,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Till all their souls were fled, and they had then"
16973,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Felt ’twas but pain to sport with lawless men.
16974,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, the women came all drown’d in moan,"
16975,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And weeping bitterly. But first was done
16976,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The bearing thence the dead; all which beneath
16977,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The portico they stow’d, where death on death"
16978,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They heap’d together. Then took all the pains
16979,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ulysses will’d. His son yet and the swains
16980,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With paring-shovels wrought. The women bore
16981,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their parings forth, and all the clotter’d gore."
16982,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The house then cleans’d, they brought the women out,"
16983,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And put them in a room so wall’d about
16984,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That no means serv’d their sad estates to fly.
16985,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then said Telemachus: “These shall not die
16986,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A death that lets out any wanton blood,"
16987,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And vents the poison that gave lust her food,"
16988,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The body cleansing, but a death that chokes"
16989,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The breath, and altogether that provokes"
16990,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And seems as bellows to abhorréd lust,"
16991,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That both on my head pour’d depraves unjust,"
16992,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And on my mother’s, scandalling the Court,"
16993,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With men debauch’d, in so abhorr’d a sort.”"
16994,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, a halser of a ship they cast"
16995,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About a cross-beam of the roof, which fast"
16996,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They made about their necks, in twelve parts cut,"
16997,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And hal’d them up so high they could not put
16998,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their feet to any stay. As which was done,"
16999,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Look how a mavis, or a pigeon,"
17000,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In any grove caught with a springe or net,"
17001,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With struggling pinions ’gainst the ground doth beat
17002,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her tender body, and that then strait bed"
17003,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Is sour to that swing in which she was bred;
17004,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So striv’d these taken birds, till ev’ry one"
17005,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her pliant halter had enforc’d upon
17006,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her stubborn neck, and then aloft was haul’d"
17007,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To wretched death. A little space they sprawl’d,"
17008,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their feet fast moving, but were quickly still."
17009,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then fetch’d they down Melanthius, to fulfill"
17010,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The equal execution; which was done
17011,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In portal of the hall, and thus begun:"
17012,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They first slit both his nostrils, cropp’d each ear,"
17013,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His members tugg’d off, which the dogs did tear"
17014,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And chop up bleeding sweet; and, while red-hot"
17015,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The vice-abhorring blood was, off they smote"
17016,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His hands and feet; and there that work had end.
17017,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then wash’d they hands and feet that blood had stain’d,"
17018,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And took the house again. And then the King
17019,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Euryclea calling, bade her quickly bring"
17020,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All-ill-expelling brimstone, and some fire,"
17021,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That with perfumes cast he might make entire
17022,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The house’s first integrity in all.
17023,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then his timely will was, she should call"
17024,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her Queen and ladies; still yet charging her
17025,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That all the handmaids she should first confer.
17026,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She said he spake as fitted; but, before,"
17027,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She held it fit to change the weeds he wore,"
17028,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And she would others bring him, that not so"
17029,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His fair broad shoulders might rest clad, and show"
17030,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His person to his servants was to blame.
17031,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“First bring me fire,” said he. She went and came"
17032,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With fire and sulphur straight; with which the hall
17033,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And of the huge house all rooms capital
17034,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He throughly sweeten’d. Then went nurse to call
17035,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The handmaid servants down; and up she went
17036,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To tell the news, and will’d them to present"
17037,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their service to their sov’reign. Down they came
17038,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sustaining torches all, and pour’d a flame"
17039,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of love about their lord, with welcomes home,"
17040,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With huggings of his hands, with laboursome"
17041,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both heads and foreheads kisses, and embraces,"
17042,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And plied him so with all their loving graces
17043,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That tears and sighs took up his whole desire;
17044,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For now he knew their hearts to him entire.

17070,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Affected with a fervent joy to tell
17071,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,What all this time she did with pain conceal.
17072,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her knees revok’d their first strength, and her feet"
17073,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Were borne above the ground with wings to greet
17074,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The long-griev’d Queen with news her King was come;

17085,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of whose pow’r now thy pow’rs such proof have had.
17086,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Gods can blind with follies wisest eyes,"

17098,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since first my dearest sleeping-mate was gone
17099,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For that too-ill-to-speak-of Ilion.
17100,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hence, take your mad steps back. If any maid"
17101,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all my train besides a part had play’d
17102,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So bold to wake, and tell mine ears such lies,"
17103,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I had return’d her to her housewif’ries
17104,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With good proof of my wrath to such rude dames.
17105,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But go, your years have sav’d their younger blames.”"
17106,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She answer’d her: “I nothing wrong your ear,"
17107,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But tell the truth. Your long-miss’d lord is here,"
17108,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, with the Wooers’ slaughter, his own hand,"
17109,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In chief exploit, hath to his own command"
17110,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Reduc’d his house; and that poor guest was he,"

17124,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Such numbers so united?” “How,” said she,"
17125,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“I have not seen nor heard; but certainly
17126,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The deed is done. We sat within in fear,"

17130,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your son’s voice to mine ear, that call’d to me,"
17131,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And bade me then come forth, and then I see"
17132,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ulysses standing in the midst of all
17133,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your slaughter’d Wooers, heap’d up, like a wall,"
17134,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,One on another round about his side.
17135,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It would have done you good to have descried
17136,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your conqu’ring lord all-smear’d with blood and gore

17140,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And now your victor all the hall, defil’d"

17143,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
17144,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Thus, all the death remov’d, and ev’ry room"
17145,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made sweet and sightly, that yourself should come"
17146,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His pleasure sent me. Come, then, take you now"
17147,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your mutual fills of comfort. Grief on you
17148,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hath long and many suff’rings laid; which length,"
17149,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which many suff’rings, now your virtuous strength"
17150,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of uncorrupted chasteness hath conferr’d
17151,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A happy end to. He that long hath err’d
17152,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is safe arriv’d at home; his wife, his son,"
17153,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Found safe and good; all ill that hath been done
17154,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On all the doers’ heads, though long prolong’d,"
17155,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His right hath wreak’d, and in the place they wrong’d.”"
17156,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,She answer’d: “Do not you now laugh and boast
17157,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As you had done some great act, seeing most"
17158,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Into his being; for you know he won—
17159,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ev’n through his poor and vile condition—
17160,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A kind of prompted thought that there was plac’d
17161,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Some virtue in him fit to be embrac’d
17162,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By all the house, but most of all by me,"
17163,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And by my son that was the progeny
17164,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of both our loves. And yet it is not he,"
17165,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For all the likely proofs ye plead to me,—"
17166,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Some God hath slain the Wooers in disdain
17167,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of the abhorréd pride he saw so reign
17168,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In those base works they did. No man alive,"
17169,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or good or bad, whoever did arrive"
17170,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At their abodes once, ever could obtain"
17171,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Regard of them; and therefore their so vain
17172,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And vile deserts have found as vile an end.
17173,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, for Ulysses, never will extend"
17174,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His wish’d return to Greece, nor he yet lives.”"
17175,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“How strange a Queen are you,” said she, “that gives"
17176,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No truth your credit, that your husband, set"
17177,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Close in his house at fire, can purchase yet"
17178,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No faith of you, but that he still is far"
17179,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From any home of his! Your wit’s at war
17180,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all credulity ever! And yet now,"
17181,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I’ll name a sign shall force belief from you:
17182,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I bath’d him lately, and beheld the scar"
17183,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That still remains a mark too ocular
17184,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To leave your heart yet blinded; and I then
17185,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had run and told you, but his hand was fain"
17186,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To close my lips from th’ acclamation
17187,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My heart was breathing, and his wisdom won"
17188,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My still retention, till he gave me leave"
17189,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And charge to tell you this. Now then receive
17190,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My life for gage of his return; which take
17191,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In any cruel fashion, if I make"
17192,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All this not clear to you.” “Lov’d nurse,” said she,"
17193,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Though many things thou know’st, yet these things be"
17194,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Veil’d in the counsels th’ uncreated Gods
17195,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Have long time mask’d in; whose dark periods
17196,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"’Tis hard for thee to see into. But come,"
17197,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let’s see my son, the slain, and him by whom"
17198,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They had their slaughter.” This said, down they went;"
17199,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When, on the Queen’s part, divers thoughts were spent,"
17200,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If, all this giv’n no faith, she still should stand"
17201,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Aloof, and question more; or his hugg’d hand"
17202,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And lovéd head she should at first assay
17203,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With free-giv’n kisses. When her doubtful way
17204,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had pass’d the stony pavement, she took seat"
17205,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against her husband, in the opposite heat"
17206,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The fire then cast upon the other wall.
17207,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Himself set by the column of the hall,"
17208,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His looks cast downwards, and expected still"
17209,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When her incredulous and curious will
17210,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To shun ridiculous error, and the shame"
17211,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To kiss a husband that was not the same,"
17212,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would down, and win enough faith from his sight."
17213,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She silent sat, and her perplexéd plight"
17214,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amaze encounter’d. Sometimes she stood clear
17215,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He was her husband; sometimes the ill wear
17216,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His person had put on transform’d him so
17217,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That yet his stamp would hardly current go.
17218,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her son, her strangeness seeing, blam’d her thus:"
17219,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Mother, ungentle mother! tyrannous!"
17220,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In this too-curious modesty you show.
17221,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Why sit you from my father, nor bestow"
17222,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A word on me t’ enquire and clear such doubt
17223,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As may perplex you? Found man ever out
17224,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,One other such a wife that could forbear
17225,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her lov’d lord’s welcome home, when twenty year"
17226,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In infinite suff’rance he had spent apart.
17227,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,_No flint so hard is as a woman’s heart.”_
17228,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Son,” said she, “amaze contains my mind,"
17229,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor can I speak and use the common kind
17230,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of those enquiries, nor sustain to see"
17231,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With opposite looks his count’nance. If this be
17232,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My true Ulysses now return’d, there are"
17233,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Tokens betwixt us of more fitness far
17234,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To give me argument he is my lord;
17235,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And my assurance of him may afford
17236,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My proofs of joy for him from all these eyes
17237,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With more decorum than objéct their guise
17238,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To public notice.” The much-suff’rer brake
17239,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In laughter out, and to his son said: “Take"
17240,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your mother from the prease, that she may make"
17241,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her own proofs of me, which perhaps may give"
17242,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,More cause to the acknowledgments that drive
17243,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their show thus off. But now, because I go"
17244,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So poorly clad, she takes disdain to know"
17245,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So loath’d a creature for her lovéd lord.
17246,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let us consult, then, how we may accord"
17247,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The town to our late action. Some one slain
17248,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Hath made the all-left slaughterer of him fain
17249,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To fly his friends and country; but our swords
17250,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Have slain a city’s most supportful lords,"
17251,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The chief peers of the kingdom, therefore see"
17252,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,You use wise means t’ uphold your victory.”
17253,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“See you to that, good father,” said the son,"
17254,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“Whose counsels have the sov’reign glory won
17255,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From all men living. None will strive with you,"
17256,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But with unquestion’d girlands grace your brow,"
17257,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To whom our whole alacrities we vow
17258,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In free attendance. Nor shall our hands leave
17259,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your onsets needy of supplies to give
17260,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All the effects that in our pow’rs can fall.”
17261,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Then this,” said he, “to me seems capital"
17262,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all choice courses: Bathe we first, and then"
17263,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Attire we freshly; all our maids and men
17264,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Enjoining likewise to their best attire.
17265,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sacred singer then let touch his lyre,"
17266,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And go before us all in graceful dance,"
17267,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That all without, to whose ears shall advance"
17268,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our cheerful accents, or of travellers by,"
17269,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or firm inhabitants, solemnity"
17270,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of frolic nuptials may imagine here.
17271,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And this perform we, lest the massacre"
17272,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all our Wooers be divulg’d about
17273,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The ample city, ere ourselves get out"
17274,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And greet my father in his grove of trees,"
17275,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where, after, we will prove what policies"
17276,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Olympius shall suggest to overcome
17277,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our latest toils, and crown our welcome home.”"
17278,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This all obey’d; bath’d, put on fresh attire"
17279,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Both men and women did. Then took his lyre
17280,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The holy singer, and set thirst on fire"
17281,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With songs and faultless dances; all the court
17282,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Rung with the footings that the numerous sport
17283,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From jocund men drew and fair-girdled dames;
17284,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which heard abroad, thus flew the common fames:"
17285,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“This sure the day is when the much-woo’d Queen
17286,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Is richly wed. O wretch! That hath not been
17287,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So constant as to keep her ample house
17288,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Till th’ utmost hour had brought her foremost spouse.”
17289,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus some conceiv’d, but little knew the thing."
17290,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And now Eurynomé had bath’d the King,"
17291,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Smooth’d him with oils, and he himself attir’d"
17292,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In vestures royal. Her part then inspir’d
17293,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Goddess Pallas, deck’d his head and face"
17294,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With infinite beauties, gave a goodly grace"
17295,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of stature to him, a much plumper plight"
17296,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Through all his body breath’d, curls soft and bright"
17297,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Adorn’d his head withal, and made it show"
17298,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As if the flow’ry hyacinth did grow
17299,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all his pride there, in the gen’ral trim"
17300,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of ev’ry lock and ev’ry curious limb.
17301,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Look how a skilful artizan, well-seen"
17302,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all arts metalline, as having been"
17303,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Taught by Minerva and the God of fire,"
17304,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Doth gold with silver mix so that entire
17305,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They keep their self-distinction, and yet so"
17306,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That to the silver from the gold doth flow
17307,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A much more artificial lustre than his own,"
17308,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And thereby to the gold itself is grown
17309,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A greater glory than if wrought alone,"
17310,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Both being stuck off by either’s mixtion;
17311,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So did Minerva her’s and his combine,"
17312,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He more in her, she more in him, did shine."
17313,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like an Immortal from the bath he rose,"
17314,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And to his wife did all his grace dispose,"
17315,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Encount’ring this her strangeness: “Cruel dame
17316,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all that breathe, the Gods past steel and flame"
17317,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Have made thee ruthless. Life retains not one
17318,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all dames else that bears so overgrown
17319,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A mind with abstinence, as twenty years"
17320,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To miss her husband drown’d in woes and tears,"
17321,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And at his coming keep aloof, and fare"
17322,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As of his so long absence and his care
17323,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No sense had seiz’d her. Go, nurse, make a bed,"
17324,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That I alone may sleep; her heart is dead
17325,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To all reflection!” To him thus replied
17326,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The wise Penelope: “Man half-deified,"
17327,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,’Tis not my fashion to be taken straight
17328,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With bravest men, nor poorest use to sleight."
17329,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your mean appearance made not me retire,"
17330,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor this your rich show makes me now admire,"
17331,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor moves at all; for what is all to me
17332,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,If not my husband? All his certainty
17333,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I knew at parting; but, so long apart,"
17334,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The outward likeness holds no full desert
17335,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For me to trust to. Go, nurse, see addrest"
17336,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A soft bed for him, and the single rest"
17337,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Himself affects so. Let it be the bed
17338,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That stands within our bridal chamber-sted,"
17339,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which he himself made. Bring it forth from thence,"
17340,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And see it furnish’d with magnificence.”
17341,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said she to assay him, and did stir"
17342,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ev’n his establish’d patience; and to her
17343,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whom thus he answer’d: “Woman! your words prove
17344,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My patience strangely. Who is it can move
17345,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My bed out of his place? It shall oppress
17346,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Earth’s greatest understander; and, unless"
17347,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n God himself come, that can eas’ly grace"
17348,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Men in their most skills, it shall hold his place;"
17349,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For man he lives not that (as not most skill’d,"
17350,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So not most young) shall easily make it yield,"
17351,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If, building on the strength in which he flows,"
17352,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He adds both levers too and iron crows:
17353,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For in the fixture of the bed is shown
17354,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A master-piece, a wonder; and ’twas done"
17355,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By me, and none but me, and thus was wrought:"
17356,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,There was an olive-tree that had his grought
17357,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amidst a hedge, and was of shadow proud,"
17358,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fresh, and the prime age of his verdure show’d,"
17359,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His leaves and arms so thick that to the eye
17360,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It show’d a column for solidity.
17361,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To this had I a comprehension
17362,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To build my bridal bow’r; which all of stone,"
17363,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thick as the tree of leaves, I rais’d, and cast"
17364,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A roof about it nothing meanly grac’d,"
17365,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Put glued doors to it, that op’d art enough,"
17366,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then from the olive ev’ry broad-leav’d bough
17367,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I lopp’d away; then fell’d the tree; and then
17368,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Went over it both with my axe and plane,"
17369,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both govern’d by my line, And then I hew’d"
17370,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My curious bedstead out; in which I shew’d
17371,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Work of no common hand. All this begun,"
17372,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I could not leave till to perfection
17373,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My pains had brought it; took my wimble, bor’d"
17374,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The holes, as fitted, and did last afford"
17375,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The varied ornament, which show’d no want"
17376,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of silver, gold, and polish’d elephant."
17377,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,An ox-hide dyed in purple then I threw
17378,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Above the cords. And thus to curious view
17379,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I hope I have objected honest sign
17380,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To prove I author nought that is not mine.
17381,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But if my bed stand unremov’d or no,"
17382,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O woman, passeth human wit to know.”"
17383,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This sunk her knees and heart, to hear so true"
17384,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The signs she urg’d; and first did tears ensue
17385,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her rapt assurance; then she ran and spread
17386,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her arms about his neck, kiss’d oft his head,"
17387,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And thus the curious stay she made excus’d:
17388,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“Ulysses! Be not angry that I us’d
17389,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Such strange delays to this, since heretofore"
17390,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your suff’ring wisdom hath the garland wore
17391,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From all that breathe; and ’tis the Gods that, thus"
17392,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With mutual miss so long afflicting us,"
17393,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Have caus’d my coyness; to our youths envied
17394,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That wish’d society that should have tied
17395,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our youths and years together; and since now
17396,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Judgment and Duty should our age allow
17397,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As full joys therein as in youth and blood,"
17398,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,See all young anger and reproof withstood
17399,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For not at first sight giving up my arms,"
17400,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My heart still trembling lest the false alarms
17401,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That words oft strike-up should ridiculize me.
17402,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Had Argive Helen known credulity
17403,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would bring such plagues with it, and her again,"
17404,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As authoress of them all, with that foul stain"
17405,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To her and to her country, she had stay’d"
17406,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her love and mixture from a stranger’s bed;
17407,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But God impell’d her to a shameless deed,"
17408,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Because she had not in herself decreed,"
17409,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before th’ attempt, that such acts still were shent"
17410,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As simply in themselves as in th’ event
17411,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By which not only she herself sustains,"
17412,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But we, for her fault, have paid mutual pains."
17413,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet now, since these signs of our certain bed"
17414,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You have discover’d, and distinguishéd"
17415,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From all earth’s others, no one man but you"
17416,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet ever getting of it th’ only show,"
17417,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor one of all dames but myself and she
17418,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My father gave, old Actor’s progeny,"
17419,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Who ever guarded to ourselves the door
17420,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of that thick-shaded chamber, I no more"
17421,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will cross your clear persuasion, though till now"
17422,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I stood too doubtful and austere to you,”"
17423,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These words of hers, so justifying her stay,"
17424,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Did more desire of joyful moan convey
17425,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To his glad mind than if at instant sight
17426,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,She had allow’d him all his wishes’ right.
17427,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He wept for joy, t’ enjoy a wife so fit"
17428,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For his grave mind, that knew his depth of wit,"
17429,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And held chaste virtue at a price so high,"
17430,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as sad men at sea when shore is nigh,"
17431,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which long their hearts have wish’d, their ship quite lost"
17432,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By Neptune’s rigour, and they vex’d and tost"
17433,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"’Twixt winds and black waves, swimming for their lives,"
17434,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A few escap’d, and that few that survives,"
17435,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All drench’d in foam and brine, crawl up to land,"
17436,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With joy as much as they did worlds command;
17437,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So dear to this wife was her husband’s sight,"
17438,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who still embrac’d his neck, and had, till light"
17439,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Display’d her silver ensign, if the Dame,"
17440,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That bears the blue sky intermix’d with flame
17441,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In her fair eyes, had not infix’d her thought"
17442,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On other joys, for loves so hardly brought"
17443,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To long’d-for meeting; who th’ extended night
17444,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Withheld in long date, nor would let the light"
17445,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her wing-hoov’d horse join—Lampus, Phaeton—"
17446,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Those ever-colts that bring the morning on
17447,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To worldly men, but, in her golden chair,"
17448,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Down to the ocean by her silver hair
17449,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Bound her aspirings. Then Ulysses said:
17450,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“O wife! Nor yet are my contentions stay’d.
17451,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A most unmeasur’d labour long and hard
17452,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Asks more performance; to it being prepar’d
17453,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By grave Tiresiás, when down to hell"
17454,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I made dark passage, that his skill might tell"
17455,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My men’s return and mine. But come, and now"
17456,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Enjoy the sweet rest that our Fates allow.”
17457,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“The place of rest is ready,” she replied,"
17458,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Your will at full serve, since the Deified"
17459,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Have brought you where your right is to command.
17460,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But since you know, God making understand"
17461,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your searching mind, inform me what must be"
17462,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your last set labour; since ’twill fall to me,"
17463,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I hope, to hear it after, tell me now."
17464,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,_The greatest pleasure is before to know.”_
17465,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“Unhappy!” said Ulysses; “To what end
17466,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Importune you this labour? It will lend
17467,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor you nor me delight, but you shall know"
17468,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I was commanded yet more to bestow
17469,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My years in travel, many cities more"
17470,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By sea to visit; and when first for shore
17471,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I left my shipping, I was will’d to take"
17472,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A naval oar in hand, and with it make"
17473,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My passage forth till such strange men I met
17474,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As knew no sea, nor ever salt did eat"
17475,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With any victuals, who the purple beaks"
17476,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of ships did never see, nor that which breaks"
17477,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The waves in curls, which is a fan-like oar,"
17478,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And serves as wings with which a ship doth soar.
17479,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To let me know, then, when I was arriv’d"
17480,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On that strange earth where such a people liv’d,"
17481,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He gave me this for an unfailing sign:
17482,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When any one that took that oar of mine,"
17483,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Borne on my shoulder, for a corn-cleanse fan,"
17484,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I met ashore, and show’d to be a man"
17485,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of that land’s labour, there had I command"
17486,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To fix mine oar, and offer on that strand"
17487,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"T’ imperial Neptune, whom I must implore,"
17488,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A lamb, a bull, and sow-ascending boar;"
17489,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then turn home, where all the other Gods"
17490,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That in the broad heav’n made secure abodes
17491,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I must solicit—all my curious heed
17492,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Giv’n to the sev’ral rites they have decreed—
17493,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With holy hecatombs; and then, at home,"
17494,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A gentle death should seize me that would come
17495,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From out the sea, and take me to his rest"
17496,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In full ripe age, about me living blest"
17497,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My loving people; to which, he presag’d,"
17498,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The sequel of my fortunes were engag’d.”
17499,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“If then,” said she, “the Gods will please t’ impose"
17500,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A happier being to your fortune’s close
17501,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Than went before, your hope gives comfort strength"
17502,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That life shall lend you better days at length.”
17503,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"While this discourse spent mutual speech, the bed"
17504,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eurynomé and nurse had made, and spread"
17505,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With richest furniture, while torches spent"
17506,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their parcel-gilt thereon. To bed then went
17507,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The aged nurse; and, where their sov’reigns were,"
17508,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eurynomé, the chambermaid, did bear"
17509,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A torch, and went before them to their rest;"
17510,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To which she left them and for her’s addrest.
17511,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The King and Queen then now, as newly-wed,"
17512,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Resum’d the old laws of th’ embracing bed.
17513,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Telemachus and both his herdsmen then
17514,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Dissolv’d the dances both to maids and men;
17515,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Who in their shady roofs took timely sleep.
17516,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The bride and bridegroom having ceas’d to keep
17517,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Observéd love-joys, from their fit delight"
17518,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They turn’d to talk. The Queen then did recite
17519,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,What she had suffer’d by the hateful rout
17520,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of harmful Wooers, who had eat her out"
17521,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So many oxen and so many sheep,"
17522,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,How many tun of wine their drinking deep
17523,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Had quite exhausted. Great Ulysses then
17524,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whatever slaughters he had made of men,"
17525,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whatever sorrows he himself sustain’d,"
17526,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Repeated amply; and her ears remain’d
17527,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all delight attentive to their end,"
17528,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor would one wink sleep till he told her all,"
17529,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Beginning where he gave the Cicons fall;
17530,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From thence his pass to the Lotophagi;
17531,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Cyclop’s acts, the putting out his eye,"

17630,_Ω._,"Amidst their bodies, call’d in dreadful rout"
17631,_Ω._,Forth to th’ Infernals; who came murmuring out.
17632,_Ω._,And as amidst the desolate retreat
17633,_Ω._,"Of some vast cavern, made the sacred seat"
17634,_Ω._,"Of austere spirits, bats with breasts and wings"
17635,_Ω._,"Clasp fast the walls, and each to other clings,"

17649,_Ω._,"And there they saw the soul of Thetis’ son,"
17650,_Ω._,"Of good Patroclus, brave Antilochus,"
17651,_Ω._,"And Ajax, the supremely strenuous"
17652,_Ω._,Of all the Greek host next Pelëion;
17653,_Ω._,All which assembled about Maia’s son.
17654,_Ω._,"And to them, after, came the mournful ghost"
17655,_Ω._,"Of Agamemnon, with all those he lost"
17656,_Ω._,In false Ægisthus’ court. Achilles then
17657,_Ω._,"Beholding there that mighty king of men,"
17658,_Ω._,"Deplor’d his plight, and said: “O Atreus’ son!"
17659,_Ω._,"Of all heroës, all opinion"
17660,_Ω._,"Gave thee for Jove’s most lov’d, since most command"
17661,_Ω._,Of all the Greeks he gave thy eminent hand
17662,_Ω._,"At siege of Ilion, where we suffer’d so."
17663,_Ω._,"And is the issue this, that first in woe"
17664,_Ω._,Stern Fate did therefore set thy sequel down?
17665,_Ω._,_None borne past others’ Fates can pass his own._
17666,_Ω._,I wish to heav’n that in the height of all
17667,_Ω._,"Our pomp at Ilion Fate had sign’d thy fall,"
17668,_Ω._,That all the Greeks might have advanc’d to thee
17669,_Ω._,"A famous sepulchre, and Fame might see"
17670,_Ω._,Thy son giv’n honour in thy honour’d end!
17671,_Ω._,But now a wretched death did Fate extend
17672,_Ω._,To thy confusion and thy issue’s shame.”
17673,_Ω._,"“O Thetis’ son,” said he, “the vital flame"
17674,_Ω._,"Extinct at Ilion, far from th’ Argive fields,"
17675,_Ω._,The style of Blessed to thy virtue yields.
17676,_Ω._,About thy fall the best of Greece and Troy
17677,_Ω._,Were sacrific’d to slaughter. Thy just joy
17678,_Ω._,Conceiv’d in battle with some worth forgot
17679,_Ω._,In such a death as great Apollo shot
17680,_Ω._,At thy encounters. Thy brave person lay
17681,_Ω._,"Hid in a dusty whirlwind, that made way"
17682,_Ω._,With human breaths spent in thy ruin’s state
17683,_Ω._,"Thou, great, wert greatly valued in thy fate."
17684,_Ω._,All day we fought about thee; nor at all
17685,_Ω._,"Had ceas’d our conflict, had not Jove let fall"
17686,_Ω._,A storm that forc’d off our unwilling feet.
17687,_Ω._,"But, having brought thee from the fight to fleet,"
17688,_Ω._,"Thy glorious person, bath’d and balm’d, we laid"
17689,_Ω._,Aloft a bed; and round about thee paid
17690,_Ω._,"The Greeks warm tears to thy deplor’d decease,"
17691,_Ω._,"Quite daunted, cutting all their curls’ increase."
17692,_Ω._,Thy death drave a divine voice through the seas
17693,_Ω._,That started up thy mother from the waves;
17694,_Ω._,"And all the márine Godheads left their caves,"
17695,_Ω._,Consorting to our fleet her rapt repair.
17696,_Ω._,The Greeks stood frighted to see sea and air
17697,_Ω._,"And earth combine so in thy loss’s sense,"
17698,_Ω._,"Had taken ship and fled for ever thence,"
17699,_Ω._,If old much-knowing-Nestor had not stay’d
17700,_Ω._,Their rushing off; his counsels having sway’d
17701,_Ω._,In all times former with such cause their courses;
17702,_Ω._,"Who bade contain themselves, and trust their forces,"
17703,_Ω._,"For all they saw was Thetis come from sea,"
17704,_Ω._,"With others of the wat’ry progeny,"
17705,_Ω._,To see and mourn for her deceaséd son.
17706,_Ω._,Which stay’d the fears that all to flight had won;
17707,_Ω._,And round about thee stood th’ old sea-God’s Seeds
17708,_Ω._,"Wretchedly mourning, their immortal weeds"
17709,_Ω._,Spreading upon thee. All the sacred Nine
17710,_Ω._,"Of deathless Muses paid thee dues divine,"
17711,_Ω._,"By varied turns their heav’nly voices venting,"
17712,_Ω._,All in deep passion for thy death consenting.
17713,_Ω._,And then of all our army not an eye
17714,_Ω._,"You could have seen undrown’d in misery,"
17715,_Ω._,The moving Muse so rul’d in ev’ry mind.
17716,_Ω._,Full seventeen days and nights our tears confin’d
17717,_Ω._,To celebration of thy mournéd end;
17718,_Ω._,Both men and Gods did in thy moan contend.
17719,_Ω._,The eighteenth day we spent about thy heap
17720,_Ω._,"Of dying fire. Black oxen, fattest sheep"
17721,_Ω._,"We slew past number. Then the precious spoil,"
17722,_Ω._,"Thy corse, we took up, which with floods of oil"
17723,_Ω._,"And pleasant honey we embalm’d, and then"
17724,_Ω._,Wrapp’d thee in those robes that the Gods did rain.
17725,_Ω._,In which we gave thee to the hallow’d flame;
17726,_Ω._,"To which a number of heroical name,"
17727,_Ω._,As prest to sacrifice their vital right
17728,_Ω._,To thy dead ruins while so bright they burn’d.
17729,_Ω._,"Both foot and horse brake in, and fought and mourn’d"
17730,_Ω._,In infinite tumult. But when all the night
17731,_Ω._,"The rich flame lasted, and that wasted quite"
17732,_Ω._,Thy body was with the enamour’d fire:
17733,_Ω._,"We came in early morn, and an entire"
17734,_Ω._,Collection made of ev’ry ivory bone;
17735,_Ω._,"Which wash’d in wine, and giv’n fit unctión,"
17736,_Ω._,"A two-ear’d bowl of gold thy mother gave,"
17737,_Ω._,By Bacchus giv’n her and did form receive
17738,_Ω._,"From Vulcan’s famous hand, which, O renown’d"
17739,_Ω._,"Great Thetis’ son, with thy fair bones we crown’d"
17740,_Ω._,Mix’d with the bones of Menœtiades
17741,_Ω._,"And brave Antilochus; who, in decease"
17742,_Ω._,"Of thy Patroclus, was thy favour’s dear."
17743,_Ω._,About thee then a matchless sepulchre
17744,_Ω._,The sacred host of the Achaians rais’d
17745,_Ω._,"Upon the Hellespont, where most it seiz’d,"
17746,_Ω._,"For height and conspicuity, the eyes"
17747,_Ω._,Of living men and their posterities.
17748,_Ω._,Thy mother then obtain’d the Gods’ consent
17749,_Ω._,"To institute an honour’d game, that spent"
17750,_Ω._,The best approvement of our Grecian fames.
17751,_Ω._,In whose praise I must say that many games
17752,_Ω._,About heroës’ sepulchres mine eyes
17753,_Ω._,"Have seen perform’d, but these bore off the prize"
17754,_Ω._,With miracles to me from all before.
17755,_Ω._,In which thy silver-footed mother bore
17756,_Ω._,"The institution’s name, but thy deserts,"
17757,_Ω._,"Being great with heav’n, caus’d all the eminent parts."
17758,_Ω._,"And thus, through all the worst effects of Fate,"
17759,_Ω._,Achilles’ fame ev’n Death shall propagate.
17760,_Ω._,While anyone shall lend the light an eye
17761,_Ω._,Divine Æacides shall never die.
17762,_Ω._,But wherein can these comforts be conceiv’d
17763,_Ω._,"As rights to me? When, having quite achiev’d"
17764,_Ω._,"An end with safety, and with conquest, too,"
17765,_Ω._,"Of so unmatch’d a war, what none could do"
17766,_Ω._,"Of all our enemies there, at home a friend"
17767,_Ω._,And wife have giv’n me inglorious end?”
17768,_Ω._,"While these thus spake, the Argus-killing spy"
17769,_Ω._,Brought-near Ulysses’ noble victory
17770,_Ω._,"To their renew’d discourse, in all the ends"
17771,_Ω._,"The Wooers’ suffer’d, and show’d those his friends;"
17772,_Ω._,Whom now amaze invaded with the view
17773,_Ω._,And made give back; yet Agamemnon knew
17774,_Ω._,"Melanthius’ heir, much-fam’d Amphimedon,"
17775,_Ω._,Who had in Ithaca guest-favours shown
17776,_Ω._,"To great Atrides; who first spake, and said:"
17777,_Ω._,“Amphimedon! What suff’rance hath been laid
17778,_Ω._,On your alive parts that hath made you make
17779,_Ω._,"This land of darkness the retreat you take,"
17780,_Ω._,"So all together, all being like in years,"
17781,_Ω._,"Nor would a man have choos’d, of all the peers"
17782,_Ω._,"A city honours, men to make a part"
17783,_Ω._,More strong for any object? Hath your smart
17784,_Ω._,"Been felt from Neptune, being at sea—his wrath"
17785,_Ω._,The winds and waves exciting to your scathe?
17786,_Ω._,Or have offensive men impos’d this fate—
17787,_Ω._,"Your oxen driving, or your flock’s estate?"
17788,_Ω._,"Or for your city fighting and your wives,"
17789,_Ω._,Have deaths untimely seiz’d your best-tim’d lives?
17790,_Ω._,"Inform me truly. I was once your guest,"
17791,_Ω._,When I and Menelaus had profest
17792,_Ω._,"First arms for Ilion, and were come ashore"
17793,_Ω._,"On Ithaca, with purpose to implore"
17794,_Ω._,"Ulysses’ aid, that city-racing man,"
17795,_Ω._,In wreak of the adult’rous Phrygian.
17796,_Ω._,Retain not you the time? A whole month’s date
17797,_Ω._,"We spent at sea, in hope to instigate"
17798,_Ω._,"In our arrival old Laertes’ son,"
17799,_Ω._,"Whom, hardly yet, to our design we won.”"
17800,_Ω._,"The soul made answer: “Worthiest king of men,"
17801,_Ω._,I well remember ev’ry passage then
17802,_Ω._,"You now reduce to thought, and will relate"
17803,_Ω._,The truth in whole form of our timeless fate:
17804,_Ω._,"“We woo’d the wife of that long-absent king,"
17805,_Ω._,Who (though her second marriage were a thing
17806,_Ω._,Of most hate to her) she would yet deny
17807,_Ω._,"At no part our affections, nor comply"
17808,_Ω._,"With any in performance, but decreed,"
17809,_Ω._,"In her delays, the cruel Fates we feed."
17810,_Ω._,Her craft was this: She undertook to weave
17811,_Ω._,A funeral garment destin’d to receive
17812,_Ω._,The corse of old Laertes; being a task
17813,_Ω._,"Of infinite labour, and which time would ask."
17814,_Ω._,In midst of whose attempt she caus’d our stay
17815,_Ω._,"With this attraction: ‘Youths, that come in way"
17816,_Ω._,"Of honour’d nuptials to me, though my lord"
17817,_Ω._,"Abide amongst the dead, yet cease to board"
17818,_Ω._,"My choice for present nuptials, and sustain,"
17819,_Ω._,"Lest what is past me of this web be vain,"
17820,_Ω._,Till all receive perfection. ’Tis a weed
17821,_Ω._,Dispos’d to wrap in at his funeral need
17822,_Ω._,"The old Laertes; who, possessing much,"
17823,_Ω._,"Would, in his want of rites as fitting, touch"
17824,_Ω._,My honour highly with each vulgar dame.’
17825,_Ω._,"Thus spake she, and persuaded; and her frame"
17826,_Ω._,"All-day she labour’d, her day’s work not small,"
17827,_Ω._,But ev’ry night-time she unwrought it all.
17828,_Ω._,Three years continuing this imperfect task;
17829,_Ω._,But when the fourth year came her sleights could mask
17830,_Ω._,"In no more covert, since her trusted maid"
17831,_Ω._,Her whole deceit to our true note betray’d.
17832,_Ω._,"With which surpriz’d, she could no more protract"
17833,_Ω._,"Her work’s perfection, but gave end exact"
17834,_Ω._,"To what remain’d, wash’d-up, and set thereon"
17835,_Ω._,A gloss so bright that like the sun and moon
17836,_Ω._,The whole work show’d together. And when now
17837,_Ω._,Of mere necessity her honour’d vow
17838,_Ω._,"She must make good to us, ill-fortune brought"
17839,_Ω._,"Ulysses home, who yet gave none one thought"
17840,_Ω._,"Of his arrival, but far-off at field"
17841,_Ω._,"Liv’d with his herdsman, nor his trust would yield"
17842,_Ω._,"Note of his person, but liv’d there as guest,"
17843,_Ω._,Ragg’d as a beggar in that life profest.
17844,_Ω._,"At length Telemachus left Pylos’ sand,"
17845,_Ω._,"And with a ship fetch’d soon his native land,"
17846,_Ω._,"When yet not home he went, but laid his way"
17847,_Ω._,Up to his herdsman where his father lay;
17848,_Ω._,And where both laid our deaths. To town then bore
17849,_Ω._,"The swine-herd and his King, the swain before,"
17850,_Ω._,Telemachus in other ways bestow’d
17851,_Ω._,"His course home first, t’ associate us that woo’d."
17852,_Ω._,"The swain the King led after, who came on"
17853,_Ω._,"Raggéd and wretched, and still lean’d upon"
17854,_Ω._,"A borrow’d staff. At length he reach’d his home,"
17855,_Ω._,Where (on the sudden and so wretched come)
17856,_Ω._,Nor we nor much our elders once did dream
17857,_Ω._,"Of his return there, but did wrongs extreme"
17858,_Ω._,Of words and blows to him; all which he bore
17859,_Ω._,With that old patience he had learn’d before.
17860,_Ω._,"But when the mind of Jove had rais’d his own,"
17861,_Ω._,"His son and he fetch’d all their armour down,"
17862,_Ω._,"Fast-lock’d the doors, and, to prepare their use,"
17863,_Ω._,"He will’d his wife, for first mean, to produce"
17864,_Ω._,His bow to us to draw; of which no one
17865,_Ω._,Could stir the string; himself yet set upon
17866,_Ω._,"The deadly strength it held, drew all with ease,"
17867,_Ω._,"Shot through the steels, and then began to seize"
17868,_Ω._,Our armless bosoms; striking first the breast
17869,_Ω._,"Of king Antinous, and then the rest"
17870,_Ω._,In heaps turn’d over; hopeful of his end
17871,_Ω._,"Because some God, he knew, stood firm his friend."
17872,_Ω._,"Nor prov’d it worse with him, but all in flood"
17873,_Ω._,The pavement straight blush’d with our vital blood.
17874,_Ω._,And thus our souls came here; our bodies laid
17875,_Ω._,"Neglected in his roofs, no word convey’d"
17876,_Ω._,To any friend to take us home and give
17877,_Ω._,"Our wounds fit balming, nor let such as live"
17878,_Ω._,"Entomb our deaths, and for our fortunes shed"
17879,_Ω._,Those tears and dead-rites that renown the dead.”
17880,_Ω._,Atrides’ ghost gave answer: “O bless’d son
17881,_Ω._,"Of old Laertes, thou at length hast won"
17882,_Ω._,With mighty virtue thy unmatchéd wife.
17883,_Ω._,"How good a knowledge, how untouch’d a life,"
17884,_Ω._,Hath wise Penelope! How well she laid
17885,_Ω._,"Her husband’s rights up, whom she lov’d a maid!"
17886,_Ω._,"For which her virtues shall extend applause,"
17887,_Ω._,Beyond the circles frail mortality draws;
17888,_Ω._,The deathless in this vale of death comprising
17889,_Ω._,Her praise in numbers into infinites rising.
17890,_Ω._,The daughter Tyndarus begat begot
17891,_Ω._,"No such chaste thoughts, but cut the virgin knot"
17892,_Ω._,That knit her spouse and her with murd’rous swords.
17893,_Ω._,For which posterities shall put hateful words
17894,_Ω._,"To notes of her that all her sex defam’d,"
17895,_Ω._,And for her ill shall ev’n the good be blam’d.”
17896,_Ω._,To this effect these these digressions made
17897,_Ω._,"In hell, earth’s dark and ever-hiding shade."
17898,_Ω._,"Ulysses and his son, now past the town,"
17899,_Ω._,Soon reach’d the field elaborately grown
17900,_Ω._,"By old Laertes’ labour, when, with cares"
17901,_Ω._,"For his lost son, he left all court affairs,"
17902,_Ω._,And took to this rude upland; which with toil
17903,_Ω._,He made a sweet and habitable soil;
17904,_Ω._,"Where stood a house to him; about which ran,"
17905,_Ω._,"In turnings thick and labyrinthian,"
17906,_Ω._,"Poor hovels, where his necessary men"
17907,_Ω._,That did those works (of pleasure to him then)
17908,_Ω._,"Might sit, and eat, and sleep. In his own house"
17909,_Ω._,"An old Sicilian dame liv’d, studious"
17910,_Ω._,To serve his sour age with her cheerful pains.
17911,_Ω._,Then said Ulysses to his son and swains:
17912,_Ω._,"“Go you to town, and for your dinner kill"
17913,_Ω._,The best swine ye can choose; myself will still
17914,_Ω._,"Stay with my father, and assay his eye"
17915,_Ω._,"If my acknowledg’d truth it can descry,"
17916,_Ω._,Or that my long time’s travel doth so change
17917,_Ω._,My sight to him that I appear as strange.”
17918,_Ω._,"Thus gave he arms to them, and home they hied."
17919,_Ω._,Ulysses to the fruitful field applied
17920,_Ω._,"His present place; nor found he Dolius there,"
17921,_Ω._,"His sons, or any servant, anywhere"
17922,_Ω._,In all that spacious ground; all gone from thence
17923,_Ω._,"Were dragging bushes to repair a fence,"
17924,_Ω._,Old Dolius leading all. Ulysses found
17925,_Ω._,"His father far above in that fair ground,"
17926,_Ω._,Employ’d in proining of a plant; his weeds
17927,_Ω._,"All torn and tatter’d, fit for homely deeds,"
17928,_Ω._,But not for him. Upon his legs he wore
17929,_Ω._,Patch’d boots to guard him from the bramble’s gore;
17930,_Ω._,His hands had thorn-proof hedging mittens on;
17931,_Ω._,His head a goat-skin casque; through all which shone
17932,_Ω._,His heart giv’n over to abjectest moan.
17933,_Ω._,"Him when Ulysses saw consum’d with age,"
17934,_Ω._,And all the ensigns on him that the rage
17935,_Ω._,"Of grief presented, he brake out in tears;"
17936,_Ω._,"And, taking stand then where a tree of pears"
17937,_Ω._,"Shot high his forehead over him, his mind"
17938,_Ω._,"Had much contention, if to yield to kind,"
17939,_Ω._,"Make straight way to his father, kiss, embrace,"
17940,_Ω._,"Tell his return, and put on all the face"
17941,_Ω._,And fashion of his instant-told return;
17942,_Ω._,"Or stay th’ impulsion, and the long day burn"
17943,_Ω._,Of his quite loss giv’n in his father’s fear
17944,_Ω._,"A little longer, trying first his cheer"
17945,_Ω._,"With some free dalliance, th’ earnest being so near."
17946,_Ω._,"This course his choice preferr’d, and forth he went."
17947,_Ω._,His father then his aged shoulders bent
17948,_Ω._,"Beneath what years had stoop’d, about a tree"
17949,_Ω._,"Busily digging: “O, old man,” said he,"
17950,_Ω._,"“You want no skill to dress and deck your ground,"
17951,_Ω._,For all your plants doth order’d distance bound.
17952,_Ω._,"No apple, pear, or olive, fig; or vine,"
17953,_Ω._,Nor any plat or quarter you confine
17954,_Ω._,"To grass or flow’rs stands empty of your care,"
17955,_Ω._,Which shows exact in each peculiar;
17956,_Ω._,And yet (which let not move you) you bestow
17957,_Ω._,"No care upon yourself, though to this show"
17958,_Ω._,Of outward irksomeness to what you are
17959,_Ω._,"You labour with an inward froward care,"
17960,_Ω._,"Which is your age, that should wear all without"
17961,_Ω._,More neat and cherishing. I make no doubt
17962,_Ω._,That any sloth you use procures your lord
17963,_Ω._,To let an old man go so much abhorr’d
17964,_Ω._,In all his weeds; nor shines there in your look
17965,_Ω._,A fashion and a goodliness so took
17966,_Ω._,With abject qualities to merit this
17967,_Ω._,Nasty entreaty. Your resemblance is
17968,_Ω._,"A very king’s, and shines through this retreat."
17969,_Ω._,You look like one that having wash’d and eat
17970,_Ω._,"Should sleep securely, lying sweet and neat."
17971,_Ω._,"_It is the ground of age, when cares abuse it,"
17972,_Ω._,"To know life’s end, and, as ’tis sweet, so use it._"
17973,_Ω._,"“But utter truth, and tell what lord is he"
17974,_Ω._,That rates your labour and your liberty?
17975,_Ω._,Whose orchard is it that you husband thus?
17976,_Ω._,"Or quit me this doubt, for if Ithacus"
17977,_Ω._,"This kingdom claims for his, the man I found"
17978,_Ω._,At first arrival here is hardly sound
17979,_Ω._,"Of brain or civil, not enduring stay"
17980,_Ω._,To tell nor hear me my inquiry out
17981,_Ω._,"Of that my friend, if still he bore about"
17982,_Ω._,"His life and being, or were div’d to death,"
17983,_Ω._,And in the house of him that harboureth
17984,_Ω._,The souls of men. For once he liv’d my guest;
17985,_Ω._,My land and house retaining interest
17986,_Ω._,In his abode there; where there sojourn’d none
17987,_Ω._,As guest from any foreign region
17988,_Ω._,Of more price with me. He deriv’d his race
17989,_Ω._,"From Ithaca, and said his father was"
17990,_Ω._,"Laertes, surnam’d Arcesiades,"
17991,_Ω._,"I had him home, and all the offices"
17992,_Ω._,"Perform’d to him that fitted any friend,"
17993,_Ω._,Whose proof I did to wealthy gifts extend:
17994,_Ω._,"Seven talents gold; a bowl all-silver, set"
17995,_Ω._,With pots of flowers; twelve robes that had no pleat!
17996,_Ω._,"Twelve cloaks, or mantles, of delicious dye;"
17997,_Ω._,Twelve inner weeds; twelve suits of tapestry.
17998,_Ω._,I gave him likewise women skill’d in use
17999,_Ω._,"Of loom and needle, freeing him to choose"
18000,_Ω._,"Four the most fair.” His father, weeping, said:"
18001,_Ω._,“Stranger! The earth to which you are convey’d
18002,_Ω._,"Is Ithaca; by such rude men possess’d,"
18003,_Ω._,"Unjust and insolent, as first address’d"
18004,_Ω._,To your encounter; but the gifts you gave
18005,_Ω._,"Were giv’n, alas! to the ungrateful grave."
18006,_Ω._,"If with his people, where you now arrive,"
18007,_Ω._,"Your fate had been to find your friend alive,"
18008,_Ω._,"You should have found like guest-rites from his hand,"
18009,_Ω._,"Like gifts, and kind pass to your wishéd land."
18010,_Ω._,But how long since receiv’d you for your guest
18011,_Ω._,"Your friend, my son, who was th’ unhappiest"
18012,_Ω._,"Of all men breathing, if he were at all?"
18013,_Ω._,O born when Fates and ill-aspects let fall
18014,_Ω._,A cruel influence for him! Far away
18015,_Ω._,From friends and country destin’d to allay.
18016,_Ω._,"The sea-bred appetites, or, left ashore,"
18017,_Ω._,"To be by fowls and upland monsters tore,"
18018,_Ω._,His life’s kind authors nor his wealthy wife
18019,_Ω._,"Bemoaning, as behov’d, his parted life,"
18020,_Ω._,"Nor closing, as in honour’s course it lies"
18021,_Ω._,"To all men dead, in bed his dying eyes."
18022,_Ω._,But give me knowledge of your name and race.
18023,_Ω._,What city bred you? Where the anchoring-place
18024,_Ω._,Your ship now rides-at lies that shor’d you here
18025,_Ω._,"And where your men? Or, if a passenger"
18026,_Ω._,"In other keels you came, who (giving land"
18027,_Ω._,"To your adventures here, some other strand"
18028,_Ω._,To fetch in further course) have left to us
18029,_Ω._,Your welcome presence?” His reply was thus:
18030,_Ω._,"“I am of Alybandé, where I hold"
18031,_Ω._,"My name’s chief house, to much renown extoll’d."
18032,_Ω._,"My father Aphidantes, fam’d to spring"
18033,_Ω._,"From Polypemon, the Molossian king."
18034,_Ω._,My name Eperitus. My taking land
18035,_Ω._,On this fair Isle was rul’d by the command
18036,_Ω._,"Of God or fortune, quite against consent"
18037,_Ω._,"Of my free purpose, that in course was bent"
18038,_Ω._,For th’ isle Sicania. My ship is held
18039,_Ω._,"Far from the city, near an ample field."
18040,_Ω._,"And for Ulysses, since his pass from me"
18041,_Ω._,"’Tis now five years. Unbless’d by destiny,"
18042,_Ω._,That all this time hath had the fate to err!
18043,_Ω._,"Though, at his parting, good birds did augur"
18044,_Ω._,"His putting-off, and on his right hand flew,"
18045,_Ω._,"Which to his passage my affection drew,"
18046,_Ω._,His spirit joyful; and my hope was now
18047,_Ω._,"To guest with him, and see his hand bestow"
18048,_Ω._,Rites of our friendship.” This a cloud of grief
18049,_Ω._,Cast over all the forces of his life.
18050,_Ω._,With both his hands the burning dust he swept
18051,_Ω._,"Up from the earth, which on his head he heapt,"
18052,_Ω._,And fetch’d a sigh as in it life were broke.
18053,_Ω._,"Which grieved his son, and gave so smart a stroke"
18054,_Ω._,"Upon his nostrils with the inward stripe,"
18055,_Ω._,That up the vein rose there; and weeping ripe
18056,_Ω._,He was to see his sire feel such woe
18057,_Ω._,"For his dissembled joy; which now let go,"
18058,_Ω._,"He sprung from earth, embrac’d and kiss’d his sire,"
18059,_Ω._,And said: “O father! He of whom y’ enquire
18060,_Ω._,"Am I myself, that, from you twenty years,"
18061,_Ω._,"Is now return’d. But do not break in tears,"
18062,_Ω._,"For now we must not forms of kind maintain,"
18063,_Ω._,But haste and guard the substance. I have slain
18064,_Ω._,"All my wife’s Wooers, so revenging now"
18065,_Ω._,Their wrong so long time suffer’d. Take not you
18066,_Ω._,The comfort of my coming then to heart
18067,_Ω._,"At this glad instant, but, in prov’d desert"
18068,_Ω._,"Of your grave judgment, give moan glad suspense,"
18069,_Ω._,And on the sudden put this consequence
18070,_Ω._,"In act as absolute, as all time went"
18071,_Ω._,To ripening of your resolute assent.”
18072,_Ω._,All this haste made not his staid faith so free
18073,_Ω._,"To trust his words; who said: “If you are he,"
18074,_Ω._,"Approve it by some sign.” “This scar then see,”"
18075,_Ω._,"Replied Ulysses, “giv’n me by the boar"
18076,_Ω._,"Slain in Parnassus, I being sent before"
18077,_Ω._,"By your’s and by my honour’d mother’s will,"
18078,_Ω._,To see your sire Autolycus fulfill
18079,_Ω._,The gifts he vow’d at giving of my name.
18080,_Ω._,"I’ll tell you, too, the trees, in goodly frame"
18081,_Ω._,"Of this fair orchard, that I ask’d of you"
18082,_Ω._,"Being yet a child, and follow’d for your show"
18083,_Ω._,And name of ev’ry tree. You gave me then
18084,_Ω._,"Of fig-trees forty, apple-bearers ten,"
18085,_Ω._,"Pear-trees thirteen, and fifty ranks of vine;"
18086,_Ω._,Each one of which a season did confine
18087,_Ω._,For his best eating. Not a grape did grow
18088,_Ω._,"That grew not there, and had his heavy brow"
18089,_Ω._,"When Jove’s fair daughters, the all ripening Hours,"
18090,_Ω._,Gave timely date to it.” This charg’d the pow’rs
18091,_Ω._,Both of his knees and heart with such impression
18092,_Ω._,"Of sudden comfort, that it gave possession"
18093,_Ω._,"Of all to Trance, the signs were all so true,"
18094,_Ω._,And did the love that gave them so renew.
18095,_Ω._,"He cast his arms about his son and sunk,"
18096,_Ω._,The circle slipping to his feet; so shrunk
18097,_Ω._,Were all his age’s forces with the fire
18098,_Ω._,Of his young love rekindled. The old sire
18099,_Ω._,The son took up quite lifeless. But his breath
18100,_Ω._,"Again respiring, and his soul from death"
18101,_Ω._,"His body’s pow’r recov’ring, out he cried,"
18102,_Ω._,And said: “O Jupiter! I now have tried
18103,_Ω._,That still there live in heav’n rememb’ring Gods
18104,_Ω._,Of men that serve them; though the periods
18105,_Ω._,They set on their appearances are long
18106,_Ω._,"In best men’s suff’rings, yet as sure as strong"
18107,_Ω._,"They are in comforts, be their strange delays"
18108,_Ω._,Extended never so from days to days.
18109,_Ω._,Yet see the short joys or the soon-mix’d fears
18110,_Ω._,Of helps withheld by them so many years!
18111,_Ω._,For if the Wooers now have paid the pain
18112,_Ω._,"Due to their impious pleasures, now again"
18113,_Ω._,"Extreme fear takes me, lest we straight shall see"
18114,_Ω._,"The Ithacensians here in mutiny,"
18115,_Ω._,Their messengers dispatch’d to win to friend
18116,_Ω._,The Cephallenian cities.” “Do not spend
18117,_Ω._,"Your thoughts on these cares,” said his suff’ring son,"
18118,_Ω._,"“But be of comfort, and see that course run"
18119,_Ω._,"That best may shun the worst. Our house is near,"
18120,_Ω._,Telemachus and both his herdsmen there
18121,_Ω._,To dress our supper with their utmost haste;
18122,_Ω._,"And thither haste we.” This said, forth they past,"
18123,_Ω._,"Came home, and found Telemachus at feast"
18124,_Ω._,"With both his swains; while who had done, all drest"
18125,_Ω._,With baths and balms and royally array’d
18126,_Ω._,The old king was by his Sicilian maid.
18127,_Ω._,"By whose side Pallas stood, his crook’d-age straight’ning,"
18128,_Ω._,"His flesh more plumping, and his looks enlight’ning."
18129,_Ω._,"Who issuing then to view, his son admir’d"
18130,_Ω._,"The Gods’ aspects into his form inspir’d,"
18131,_Ω._,"And said: “O father, certainly some God"
18132,_Ω._,"By your addression in this state hath stood,"
18133,_Ω._,"More great, more rev’rend, rend’ring you by far"
18134,_Ω._,At all your parts than of yourself you are!”
18135,_Ω._,"“I would to Jove,” said he, “the Sun, and She"
18136,_Ω._,"That bears Jove’s shield, the state had stood with me"
18137,_Ω._,That help’d me take-in the well-builded tow’rs
18138,_Ω._,Of strong Nericus (the Cephalian pow’rs
18139,_Ω._,"To that fair city leading) two days past,"
18140,_Ω._,"While with the Wooers thy conflict did last,"
18141,_Ω._,And I had then been in the Wooers’ wreak!
18142,_Ω._,I should have help’d thee so to render weak
18143,_Ω._,"Their stubborn knees, that in thy joy’s desert"
18144,_Ω._,Thy breast had been too little for thy heart.”
18145,_Ω._,"This said, and supper order’d by their men,"
18146,_Ω._,"They sat to it; old Dolius ent’ring then,"
18147,_Ω._,"And with him, tried with labour, his sons came,"
18148,_Ω._,"Call’d by their mother, the Sicilian dame"
18149,_Ω._,"That brought them up and dress’d their father’s fare,"
18150,_Ω._,"As whose age grew, with it increas’d her care"
18151,_Ω._,To see him serv’d as fitted. When thus set
18152,_Ω._,"These men beheld Ulysses there at meat,"
18153,_Ω._,"They knew him, and astonish’d in the place"
18154,_Ω._,"Stood at his presence; who, with words of grace,"
18155,_Ω._,"Call’d to old Dolius, saying: “Come and eat,"
18156,_Ω._,And banish all astonishment. Your meat
18157,_Ω._,"Hath long been ready, and ourselves made stay,"
18158,_Ω._,Expecting ever when your wishéd way
18159,_Ω._,Would reach amongst us.” This brought fiercely on
18160,_Ω._,"Old Dolius from his stand; who ran upon,"
18161,_Ω._,"With both his arms abroad, the King, and kiss’d"
18162,_Ω._,"Of both his rapt up hands the either wrist,"
18163,_Ω._,"Thus welcoming his presence: “O my love,"
18164,_Ω._,"Your presence here, for which all wishes strove,"
18165,_Ω._,No one expected. Ev’n the Gods have gone
18166,_Ω._,In guide before you to your mansión.
18167,_Ω._,"Welcome, and all joys to your heart contend."
18168,_Ω._,Knows yet Penelope? Or shall we send
18169,_Ω._,"Some one to tell her this?” “She knows,” said he,"
18170,_Ω._,"“What need these troubles, father, touch at thee?”"
18171,_Ω._,"Then came the sons of Dolius, and again"
18172,_Ω._,"Went over with their father’s entertain,"
18173,_Ω._,"Welcom’d, shook hands, and then to feast sat down."
18174,_Ω._,"About which while they sat, about the town"
18175,_Ω._,"Fame flew, and shriek’d about the cruel death"
18176,_Ω._,And fate the Wooers had sustain’d beneath
18177,_Ω._,Ulysses’ roofs. All heard; together all
18178,_Ω._,"From hence and thence met in Ulysses’ hall,"
18179,_Ω._,"Short-breath’d and noiseful, bore out all the dead"
18180,_Ω._,"To instant burial, while their deaths were spread"
18181,_Ω._,"To other neighbour cities where they liv’d,"
18182,_Ω._,From whence in swiftest fisher-boats arriv’d
18183,_Ω._,Men to transfer them home. In mean space here
18184,_Ω._,The heavy nobles all in council were;
18185,_Ω._,"Where, met in much heap, up to all arose"
18186,_Ω._,Extremely-griev’d Eupitheus so to lose
18187,_Ω._,"His son Antinous, who, first of all,"
18188,_Ω._,By great Ulysses’ hand had slaught’rous fall.
18189,_Ω._,"Whose father, weeping for him, said: “O friends,"
18190,_Ω._,"This man hath author’d works of dismal ends,"
18191,_Ω._,Long since conveying in his guide to Troy
18192,_Ω._,"Good men, and many that did ships employ,"
18193,_Ω._,"All which are lost, and all their soldiers dead;"
18194,_Ω._,And now the best men Cephallenia bred
18195,_Ω._,His hand hath slaughter’d. Go we then (before
18196,_Ω._,"His ’scape to Pylos, or the Elians’ shore,"
18197,_Ω._,Where rule the Epeans) ’gainst his horrid hand;
18198,_Ω._,"For we shall grieve, and infamy will brand"
18199,_Ω._,"Our fames for ever, if we see our sons"
18200,_Ω._,"And brothers end in these confusions,"
18201,_Ω._,Revenge left uninflicted. Nor will I
18202,_Ω._,"Enjoy one day’s life more, but grieve and die"
18203,_Ω._,With instant onset. Nor should you survive
18204,_Ω._,To keep a base and beastly name alive.
18205,_Ω._,"Haste, then, lest flight prevent us.” This with tears"
18206,_Ω._,"His griefs advis’d, and made all sufferers"
18207,_Ω._,In his affliction. But by this was come
18208,_Ω._,Up to the council from Ulysses’ home—
18209,_Ω._,"When sleep had left them, which the slaughters there"
18210,_Ω._,And their self-dangers from their eyes in fear
18211,_Ω._,Had two nights intercepted—those two men
18212,_Ω._,"That just Ulysses sav’d out of the slain,"
18213,_Ω._,Which Medon and the sacred singer were.
18214,_Ω._,These stood amidst the council; and the fear
18215,_Ω._,The slaughter had impress’d in either’s look
18216,_Ω._,"Stuck still so ghastly, that amaze it strook"
18217,_Ω._,Through ev’ry there beholder. To whose ears
18218,_Ω._,"One thus enforc’d, in his fright, cause of theirs:"
18219,_Ω._,"“Attend me, Ithacensians! This stern fact"
18220,_Ω._,Done by Ulysses was not put in act
18221,_Ω._,Without the Gods’ assistance. These self eyes
18222,_Ω._,Saw one of the immortal Deities
18223,_Ω._,"Close by Ulysses, Mentor’s form put on"
18224,_Ω._,At ev’ry part. And this sure Deity shone
18225,_Ω._,"Now near Ulysses, setting on his bold"
18226,_Ω._,"And slaught’rous spirit, now the points controll’d"
18227,_Ω._,"Of all the Wooers’ weapons, round about"
18228,_Ω._,"The arm’d house whisking, in continual rout"
18229,_Ω._,"Their party putting, till in heaps they fell.”"
18230,_Ω._,"This news new fears did through their spirits impell,"
18231,_Ω._,"When Halitherses (honour’d Mastor’s son,"
18232,_Ω._,Who of them all saw only what was done
18233,_Ω._,Present and future) the much-knowing man
18234,_Ω._,And aged heroë this plain course ran
18235,_Ω._,"Amongst their counsels: “Give me likewise ear,"
18236,_Ω._,"And let me tell ye, friends, that these ills bear"
18237,_Ω._,"On your malignant spleens their sad effects,"
18238,_Ω._,"Who not what I persuaded gave respects,"
18239,_Ω._,"Nor what the people’s pastor, Mentor, said,—"
18240,_Ω._,That you should see your issues’ follies stay’d
18241,_Ω._,"In those foul courses, by their petulant life"
18242,_Ω._,"The goods devouring, scandalling the wife"
18243,_Ω._,"Of no mean person, who, they still would say,"
18244,_Ω._,Could never more see his returning-day.
18245,_Ω._,"Which yet appearing now, now give it trust,"
18246,_Ω._,And yield to my free counsels: Do not thrust
18247,_Ω._,Your own safe persons on the acts your sons
18248,_Ω._,"So dearly bought, lest their confusions"
18249,_Ω._,On your lov’d heads your like addictions draw.”
18250,_Ω._,This stood so far from force of any law
18251,_Ω._,"To curb their loose attempts, that much the more"
18252,_Ω._,"They rush’d to wreak, and made rude tumult roar."
18253,_Ω._,The greater part of all the court arose;
18254,_Ω._,Good counsel could not ill designs dispose.
18255,_Ω._,"Eupitheus was persuader of the course,"
18256,_Ω._,"Which, cómplete-arm’d, they put in present force;"
18257,_Ω._,The rest sat still in council. These men met
18258,_Ω._,"Before the broad town, in a place they set"
18259,_Ω._,All girt in arms; Eupitheus choosing chief
18260,_Ω._,"To all their follies, who put grief to grief,"
18261,_Ω._,And in his slaughter’d son’s revenge did burn.
18262,_Ω._,"But Fate gave never feet to his return,"
18263,_Ω._,Ordaining there his death. Then Pallas spake
18264,_Ω._,"To Jove, her Father, with intent to make"
18265,_Ω._,"His will high arbiter of th’ act design’d,"
18266,_Ω._,And ask’d of him what his unsearchéd mind
18267,_Ω._,"Held undiscover’d? If with arms, and ill,"
18268,_Ω._,"And grave encounter he, would first fulfill"
18269,_Ω._,"His sacred purpose, or both parts combine"
18270,_Ω._,In peaceful friendship? He ask’d: “Why incline
18271,_Ω._,These doubts thy counsels? Hast not thou decreed
18272,_Ω._,That Ithacus should come and give his deed
18273,_Ω._,The glory of revenge on these and theirs?
18274,_Ω._,Perform thy will; the frame of these affairs
18275,_Ω._,Have this fit issue: When Ulysses’ hand
18276,_Ω._,"Hath reach’d full wreak, his then renown’d command"
18277,_Ω._,"Shall reign for ever, faithful truces strook"
18278,_Ω._,’Twixt him and all; for ev’ry man shall brook
18279,_Ω._,His sons’ and brothers’ slaughters; by our mean
18280,_Ω._,"To send Oblivion in, expunging clean"
18281,_Ω._,"The character of enmity in them all,"
18282,_Ω._,"As in best leagues before. _Peace, festival,"
18283,_Ω._,"And riches in abundance, be the state"
18284,_Ω._,That crowns the close of wise Ulysses’ Fate.”_
18285,_Ω._,"This spurr’d the free, who from heav’n’s continent"
18286,_Ω._,To th’ Ithacensian isle made straight descent.
18287,_Ω._,"Where, dinner past, Ulysses said: “Some one"
18288,_Ω._,Look out to see their nearness.” Dolius’ son
18289,_Ω._,"Made present speed abroad, and saw them nigh,"
18290,_Ω._,"Ran back, and told, bade arm; and instantly"
18291,_Ω._,"Were all in arms. Ulysses’ part was four,"
18292,_Ω._,And six more sons of Dolius; all his pow’r
18293,_Ω._,"Two only more, which were his aged sire"
18294,_Ω._,"And like-year’d Dolius, whose lives’-slak’d fire"
18295,_Ω._,"All-white had left their heads, yet, driv’n by need,"
18296,_Ω._,Made soldiers both of necessary deed.
18297,_Ω._,"And now, all-girt in arms, the ports set wide,"
18298,_Ω._,"They sallied forth, Ulysses being their guide;"
18299,_Ω._,"And to them in the instant Pallas came,"
18300,_Ω._,"In form and voice like Mentor, who a flame"
18301,_Ω._,Inspir’d of comfort in Ulysses’ heart
18302,_Ω._,"With her seen presence. To his son, apart,"
18303,_Ω._,"He thus then spake: “Now, son, your eyes shall see,"
18304,_Ω._,"Expos’d in slaught’rous fight, the enemy,"
18305,_Ω._,Against whom who shall best serve will be seen.
18306,_Ω._,"Disgrace not then your race, that yet hath been"
18307,_Ω._,For force and fortitude the foremost tried
18308,_Ω._,Of all earth’s offsprings.” His true son replied:
18309,_Ω._,"“Yourself shall see, lov’d father, if you please,"
18310,_Ω._,That my deservings shall in nought digress
18311,_Ω._,From best fame of our race’s foremost merit.”
18312,_Ω._,"The old king sprung for joy to hear his spirit,"
18313,_Ω._,"And said: “O lov’d Immortals, what a day"
18314,_Ω._,Do your clear bounties to my life display!
18315,_Ω._,"I joy, past measure, to behold my son"
18316,_Ω._,And nephew close in such contention
18317,_Ω._,"Of virtues martial.” Pallas, standing near,"
18318,_Ω._,"Said: “O my friend! Of all supremely dear,"
18319,_Ω._,"Seed of Arcesius, pray to Jove and Her"
18320,_Ω._,"That rules in arms, his daughter, and a dart,"
18321,_Ω._,"Spritefully brandish’d, hurl at th’ adverse part.”"
18322,_Ω._,"This said, he pray’d; and she a mighty force"
18323,_Ω._,"Inspir’d within him, who gave instant course"
18324,_Ω._,"To his brave-brandish’d lance, which struck the brass"
18325,_Ω._,"That cheek’d Eupitheus’ casque, and thrust his pass"
18326,_Ω._,"Quite through his head; who fell, and sounded falling,"
18327,_Ω._,His arms the sound again from earth recalling.
18328,_Ω._,"Ulysses and his son rush’d on before,"
18329,_Ω._,And with their both-way-headed darts did gore
18330,_Ω._,"Their enemies’ breasts so thick, that all had gone"
18331,_Ω._,"The way of slaughter, had not Pallas thrown"
18332,_Ω._,"Her voice betwixt them, charging all to stay"
18333,_Ω._,And spare expense of blood. Her voice did fray
18334,_Ω._,The blood so from their faces that it left
18335,_Ω._,A greenish paleness; all their hands it reft
18336,_Ω._,"Of all their weapons, falling thence to earth;"
18337,_Ω._,"And to the common mother of their birth,"
18338,_Ω._,"The city, all fled, in desire to save"
18339,_Ω._,The lives yet left them. Then Ulysses gave
18340,_Ω._,"A horrid shout, and like Jove’s eagle flew"
18341,_Ω._,"In fiery pursuit, till Saturnius threw"
18342,_Ω._,"His smoking lightning ’twixt them, that had fall"
18343,_Ω._,"Before Minerva, who then out did call"
18344,_Ω._,Thus to Ulysses: “Born of Jove! Abstain
18345,_Ω._,From further bloodshed. Jove’s hand in the slain
18346,_Ω._,Hath equall’d in their pains their prides to thee.
18347,_Ω._,"Abstain, then, lest you move the Deity.”"
18348,_Ω._,"Again then, ’twixt both parts the Seed of Jove,"
18349,_Ω._,"Athenian Pallas, of all future love"
18350,_Ω._,"A league compos’d, and for her form took choice"
18351,_Ω._,Of Mentor’s likeness both in limb and voice.

18591,THE OCCASION OF THIS IMPOSED CROWNE,"After this not only Prime of Poets, but Philosophers, had written his"
18592,THE OCCASION OF THIS IMPOSED CROWNE,two great poems of Iliads and Odysses; which (for their first lights
18593,THE OCCASION OF THIS IMPOSED CROWNE,born before all learning) were worthily called the Sun and Moon of the
18594,THE OCCASION OF THIS IMPOSED CROWNE,"Earth; finding no compensation, he writ in contempt of men this"
18595,THE OCCASION OF THIS IMPOSED CROWNE,"ridiculous poem of Vermin, giving them nobility of birth, valorous"
18596,THE OCCASION OF THIS IMPOSED CROWNE,"elocution not inferior to his heroes. At which the Gods themselves, put"
18597,THE OCCASION OF THIS IMPOSED CROWNE,"in amaze, called councils about their assistance of either army, and"
18598,THE OCCASION OF THIS IMPOSED CROWNE,"the justice of their quarrels, even to the mounting of Jove’s artillery"
18599,THE OCCASION OF THIS IMPOSED CROWNE,"against them, and discharge of his three-forked flashes; and all for"
18600,THE OCCASION OF THIS IMPOSED CROWNE,"the drowning of a mouse. After which slight and only recreative touch,"
18601,THE OCCASION OF THIS IMPOSED CROWNE,"he betook him seriously to the honour of the Gods, in Hymns resounding"
18602,THE OCCASION OF THIS IMPOSED CROWNE,"all their peculiar titles, jurisdictions, and dignities; which he"
18603,THE OCCASION OF THIS IMPOSED CROWNE,"illustrates at all parts, as he had been continually conversant amongst"
18604,THE OCCASION OF THIS IMPOSED CROWNE,them; and whatsoever authentic Poesy he omitted in the episodes
18605,THE OCCASION OF THIS IMPOSED CROWNE,"contained in his Iliads and Odysses, he comprehends and concludes in"
18606,THE OCCASION OF THIS IMPOSED CROWNE,"his Hymns and Epigrams. All his observance and honour of the Gods,"
18607,THE OCCASION OF THIS IMPOSED CROWNE,"rather moved their envies against him, than their rewards, or respects"
18608,THE OCCASION OF THIS IMPOSED CROWNE,of his endeavours. And so like a man _verecundi ingenii_ (which he
18609,THE OCCASION OF THIS IMPOSED CROWNE,witnesseth of himself) he lived unhonoured and needy till his death;
18610,THE OCCASION OF THIS IMPOSED CROWNE,"and yet notwithstanding all men’s servile and manacled miseries, to his"

18622,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,The Muses’ whole quire out of Helicon
18623,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Into my heart, for such a poem’s sake,"
18624,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"As lately I did in my tables take,"
18625,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,And put into report upon my knees.
18626,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"A fight so fierce, as might in all degrees"
18627,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Fit Mars himself, and his tumultuous hand,"
18628,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Glorying to dart to th’ ears of every land
18629,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Of all the voice-divided;[1] and to show
18630,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,How bravely did both Frogs and Mice bestow
18631,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"In glorious fight their forces, even the deeds"
18632,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Daring to imitate of Earth’s Giant Seeds.
18633,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Thus then men talk’d; this seed the strife begat:
18634,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"The Mouse once dry, and ’scaped the dangerous cat,"
18635,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Drench’d in the neighbour lake her tender beard,"
18636,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,To taste the sweetness of the wave it rear’d.
18637,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"The far-famed Fen-affecter, seeing him, said:"
18638,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"“Ho, stranger! What are you, and whence, that tread"
18639,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,This shore of ours? Who brought you forth? Reply
18640,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"What truth may witness, lest I find you lie."
18641,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"If worth fruition of my love and me,"
18642,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"I’ll have thee home, and hospitality"
18643,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Of feast and gift, good and magnificent,"
18644,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Bestow on thee; for all this confluent
18645,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Resounds my royalty; my name, the great"
18646,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"In blown-up-count’nances and looks of threat,"
18647,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Physignathus,[2] adored of all Frogs here"
18648,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"All their days’ durance, and the empire bear"
18649,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Of all their beings; mine own being begot
18650,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"By royal Peleus,[3] mix’d in nuptial knot"
18651,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"With fair Hydromedusa,[4] on the bounds"
18652,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Near which Eridanus[5] his race resounds.
18653,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,And thee mine eye makes my conceit inclined
18654,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"To reckon powerful both in form and mind,"
18655,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"A sceptre-bearer, and past others far"
18656,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Advanc’d in all the fiery fights of war.
18657,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Come then, thy race to my renown commend.”"
18658,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,The Mouse made answer: “Why inquires my friend?
18659,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"For what so well know men and Deities,"
18660,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,And all the wing’d affecters of the skies?
18661,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Psicharpax[6] I am call’d; Troxartes’[7] seed,"
18662,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Surnamed the mighty-minded. She that freed
18663,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Mine eyes from darkness was Lichomyle,[8]"
18664,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"King Pternotroctes’[9] daughter, showing me,"
18665,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Within an aged hovel, the young light,"
18666,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Fed me with figs and nuts, and all the height"
18667,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Of varied viands. But unfold the cause,"
18668,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Why, ’gainst similitude’s most equal laws"
18669,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Observed in friendship, thou mak’st me thy friend?"
18670,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Thy life the waters only help t’ extend;
18671,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Mine, whatsoever men are used to eat,"
18672,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Takes part with them at shore; their purest cheat,"
18673,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Thrice boulted, kneaded, and subdued in paste,"
18674,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"In clean round kymnels, cannot be so fast"
18675,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,From my approaches kept but in I eat;
18676,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Nor cheesecakes full of finest Indian wheat,"
18677,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"That crusty-weeds[10] wear, large as ladies’ trains;"
18678,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Liverings,[11] white-skinn’d as ladies; nor the strains,"
18679,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Of press’d milk, renneted; nor collops cut"
18680,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Fresh from the flitch; nor junkets, such as put"
18681,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Palates divine in appetite; nor any
18682,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Of all men’s delicates, though ne’er so many"
18683,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Their cooks devise them, who each dish see deckt"
18684,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,With all the dainties all strange soils affect.[12]
18685,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Yet am I not so sensual to fly
18686,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Of fields embattled the most fiery cry,"
18687,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"But rush out straight, and with the first in fight"
18688,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Mix in adventure. No man with affright
18689,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Can daunt my forces, though his body be"
18690,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"or never so immense a quantity,"
18691,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"But making up, even to his bed, access,"
18692,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"His fingers’ ends dare with my teeth compress,"
18693,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"His feet taint likewise, and so soft seize both"
18694,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,They shall not taste th’ impression of a tooth.
18695,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Sweet sleep shall hold his own in every eye
18696,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Where my tooth takes his tartest liberty.
18697,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"But two there are, that always, far and near,"
18698,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Extremely still control my force with fear,"
18699,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"The Cat, and Night-hawk, who much scathe confer"
18700,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,On all the outrays where for food I err.
18701,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Together with the straits-still-keeping trap,[13]"
18702,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Where lurks deceitful and set-spleen’d mishap.
18703,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"But most of all the Cat constrains my fear,"
18704,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Being ever apt t’ assault me everywhere;
18705,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"For by that hole that hope says I shall ’scape,"
18706,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,At that hole ever she commits my rape.
18707,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"The best is yet, I eat no pot-herb grass,"
18708,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Nor radishes, nor coloquintidas,"
18709,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Nor still-green beets, nor parsley; which you make"
18710,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Your dainties still, that live upon the lake.”"
18711,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"The Frog replied: “Stranger, your boasts creep all"
18712,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Upon their bellies; though to our lives fall
18713,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Much more miraculous meats by lake and land,"
18714,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Jove tend’ring our lives with a twofold hand,"
18715,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Enabling us to leap ashore for food,"
18716,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,And hide us straight in our retreatful flood.
18717,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Which, if you will serve, you may prove with ease."
18718,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"I’ll take you on my shoulders; which fast seize,"
18719,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,If safe arrival at my house y’ intend.”
18720,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"He stoop’d, and thither spritely did ascend,"
18721,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Clasping his golden neck, that easy seat"
18722,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Gave to his sally; who was jocund yet,"
18723,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Seeing the safe harbours of the king so near,"
18724,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,And he a swimmer so exempt from peer.
18725,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"But when he sunk into the purple wave,"
18726,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"He mourn’d extremely, and did much deprave"
18727,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Unprofitable penitence; his hair
18728,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Tore by the roots up, labour’d for the air"
18729,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,With his feet fetch’d up to his belly close;
18730,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"His heart within him panted out repose,"
18731,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,For th’ insolent plight in which his state did stand;
18732,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Sigh’d bitterly, and long’d to greet the land,"
18733,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Forced by the dire need of his freezing fear.
18734,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"First, on the waters he his tail did stere,"
18735,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Like to a stern; then drew it like an oar,"
18736,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Still praying the Gods to set him safe ashore;
18737,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Yet sunk he midst the red waves more and more,"
18738,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,And laid a throat out to his utmost height;
18739,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Yet in forced speech he made his peril slight,"
18740,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,And thus his glory with his grievance strove:
18741,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,“Not in such choice state was the charge of love
18742,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Borne by the bull, when to the Cretan shore"
18743,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"He swum Europa through the wavy roar,"
18744,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"As this Frog ferries me, his pallid breast"
18745,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Bravely advancing, and his verdant crest"
18746,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"(Submitted to my seat) made my support,"
18747,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Through his white waters, to his royal court.”"
18748,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,But on the sudden did apparance make
18749,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"An horrid spectacle,—a Water-snake"
18750,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Thrusting his freckled neck above the lake.
18751,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Which seen to both, away Physignathus"
18752,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Dived to his deeps, as no way conscious"
18753,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Of whom he left to perish in his lake,"
18754,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"But shunn’d black fate himself, and let him take"
18755,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,The blackest of it; who amidst the fen
18756,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Swum with his breast up, hands held up in vain,"
18757,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Cried _Peepe_, and perish’d; sunk the waters oft,"
18758,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"And often with his sprawlings came aloft,"
18759,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Yet no way kept down death’s relentless force,"
18760,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"But, full of water, made an heavy corse."
18761,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Before he perish’d yet, he threaten’d thus:"
18762,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"“Thou lurk’st not yet from heaven, Physignathus,"
18763,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Though yet thou hid’st here, that hast cast from thee,"
18764,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"As from a rock, the shipwrack’d life of me,"
18765,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Though thou thyself no better was than I,"
18766,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"O worst of things, at any faculty,"
18767,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Wrastling or race. But, for thy perfidy"
18768,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"In this my wrack, Jove bears a wreakful eye;"
18769,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"And to the host of Mice thou pains shalt pay,"
18770,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Past all evasion.” This his life let say,"
18771,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,And left him to the waters. Him beheld
18772,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Lichopinax,[14] placed in the pleasing field,"
18773,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Who shriek’d extremely, ran and told the Mice;"
18774,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Who having heard his wat’ry destinies,"
18775,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Pernicious anger pierced the hearts of all,"
18776,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,And then their heralds forth they sent to call
18777,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"A council early, at Troxartes’ house,"
18778,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Sad father of this fatal shipwrack’d Mouse;
18779,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Whose dead corse upwards swum along the lake,"
18780,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Nor yet, poor wretch, could be enforced to make"
18781,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"The shore his harbour, but the mid-main Swum."
18782,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"When now, all haste made, with first morn did come"
18783,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,All to set council; in which first rais’d head
18784,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Troxartes, angry for his son, and said:"
18785,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"“O friends, though I alone may seem to bear"
18786,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"All the infortune, yet may all met here"
18787,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Account it their case. But ’tis true, I am"
18788,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"In chief unhappy, that a triple flame"
18789,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Of life feel put forth, in three famous sons;"
18790,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"The first, the chief in our confusions,"
18791,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"The Cat, made rape of, caught without his hole:"
18792,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"The second, Man, made with a cruel soul,"
18793,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Brought to his ruin with a new-found sleight,"
18794,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"And a most wooden engine of deceit,"
18795,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"They term a Trap, mere murth’ress of our Mice."
18796,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"The last, that in my love held special price,"
18797,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"And his rare mother’s, this Physignathus"
18798,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,(With false pretext of wafting to his house)
18799,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Strangled in chief deeps of his bloody stream.
18800,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Come then, haste all, and issue out on them,"
18801,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Our bodies deck’d in our Dædalean arms.”
18802,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"This said, his words thrust all up in alarms,"
18803,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"And Mars himself, that serves the cure of war,"
18804,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Made all in their appropriates circular.
18805,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,First on each leg the green shales of a bean
18806,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"They closed for boots, that sat exceeding clean;[15]"
18807,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"The shales they broke ope, boothaling by night,"
18808,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,And ate the beans; their jacks art exquisite
18809,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Had shown in them, being cats’ skins, everywhere"
18810,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Quilted with quills; their fenceful bucklers were
18811,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,The middle rounds of can’sticks; but their spear
18812,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"A huge long needle was, that could not bear"
18813,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,The brain of any but be Mars his own
18814,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Mortal invention; their heads’ arming crown
18815,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Was vessel to the kernel of a nut.
18816,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,And thus the Mice their powers in armour put.
18817,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"This the Frogs hearing, from the water all"
18818,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Issue to one place, and a council call"
18819,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Of wicked war; consulting what should be
18820,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Cause to this murmur and strange mutiny.
18821,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"While this was question’d, near them made his stand"
18822,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"An herald with a sceptre in his hand,"
18823,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Embasichytrus[16] call’d, that fetch’d his kind"
18824,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"From Tyroglyphus[17] with the mighty mind,"
18825,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Denouncing ill-named war in these high terms:
18826,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"“O Frogs! the Mice send threats to you of arms,"
18827,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,And bid me bid ye battle and fix’d fight;
18828,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Their eyes all wounded with Psicharpax’ sight
18829,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Floating your waters, whom your king hath kill’d,"
18830,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"And therefore all prepare for force of field,"
18831,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,You that are best born whosoever held.”
18832,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"This said, he sever’d: his speech firing th’ ears"
18833,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Of all the Mice, but freez’d the Frogs with fears,"
18834,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Themselves conceiting guilty; whom the king
18835,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Thus answer’d, rising, “Friends! I did not bring"
18836,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Psicharpax to his end; he, wantoning"
18837,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Upon our waters, practising to swim,"
18838,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Aped us,[18] and drown’d without my sight of him."
18839,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"And yet these worst of vermin accuse me,"
18840,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Though no way guilty. Come, consider we"
18841,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,How we may ruin these deceitful Mice.
18842,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"For my part, I give voice to this advice,"
18843,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,As seeming fittest to direct our deeds:
18844,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Our bodies decking with our arming weeds,"
18845,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Let all our pow’rs stand rais’d in steep’st repose
18846,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Of all our shore; that, when they charge us close,"
18847,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"We may the helms snatch off from all so deckt,"
18848,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Daring our onset, and them all deject"
18849,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Down to our waters; who, not knowing the sleight."
18850,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"To dive our soft deeps, may be strangled straight,"
18851,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"And we triumphing may a trophy rear,"
18852,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Of all the Mice that we have slaughter’d here.”
18853,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,These words put all in arms; and mallow leaves
18854,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"They drew upon their legs, for arming greaves.[19]"
18855,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Their curets, broad green beets; their bucklers were"
18856,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Good thick-leaved cabbage, proof ’gainst any spear;"
18857,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Their spears sharp bulrushes, of which were all"
18858,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Fitted with long ones; their parts capital
18859,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,They hid in subtle cockleshells from blows.
18860,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"And thus all arm’d, the steepest shores they chose"
18861,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"T’ encamp themselves; where lance with lance they lined,"
18862,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"And brandish’d bravely, each Frog full of mind."
18863,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Then Jove call’d all Gods in his flaming throne,"
18864,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,And show’d all all this preparation
18865,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"For resolute war; these able soldiers,"
18866,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Many, and great, all shaking lengthful spears,"
18867,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"In show like Centaurs, Or the Giants’ host."
18868,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"When, sweetly smiling, he inquired who, most"
18869,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Of all th’ Immortals, pleased to add their aid"
18870,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,To Frogs or Mice; and thus to Pallas said:
18871,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"“O Daughter! Must not your needs aid these Mice,"
18872,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"That, with the odours and meat sacrifice"
18873,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Used in your temple, endless triumphs make,"
18874,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,And serve you for your sacred victuals’ sake?”
18875,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Pallas replied: “O Father, never I"
18876,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Will aid the Mice in any misery.
18877,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"So many mischiefs by them I have found,"
18878,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Eating the cotton that my distaffs crown’d,[20]"
18879,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,My lamps still haunting to devour the oil.
18880,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"But that which most my mind eats, is their spoil"
18881,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Made of a veil, that me in much did stand,"
18882,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"On which bestowing an elaborate hand,"
18883,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,A fine woof working of as pure a thread;
18884,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Such holes therein their petulancies fed
18885,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"That, putting it to darning, when ’twas done,"
18886,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,The darner a most dear pay stood upon
18887,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"For his so dear pains, laid down instantly;"
18888,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Or, to forbear, exacted usury.[21]"
18889,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"So, borrowing from my fane the weed I wove,"
18890,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,I can by no means th’ usurous darner move
18891,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,To let me have the mantle to restore.
18892,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,And this is it that rubs the angry sore
18893,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Of my offence took at these petulant Mice.
18894,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Nor will I yield the Frogs’ wants my supplies,"
18895,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,For their infirm minds that no confines keep;
18896,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"For I from war retir’d, and wanting sleep,"
18897,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"All leap’d ashore in tumult, nor would stay"
18898,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Till one wink seized mine eyes, and so I lay"
18899,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Sleepless, and pain’d with headache, till first light"
18900,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"The cock had crow’d up. Therefore, to the fight"
18901,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Let no God go assistant, lest a lance"
18902,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Wound whosoever offers to advance,"
18903,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Or wishes but their aid, that scorn all foes;"
18904,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Should any God’s access their spirits oppose.
18905,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Sit we then pleased to see from heaven their fight.”
18906,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"She said, and all Gods join’d in her delight."
18907,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"And now both hosts to one field drew the jar,"
18908,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Both heralds bearing the ostents of war.
18909,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"And then the wine-gnats,[22] that shrill trumpets sound,"
18910,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Terribly rung out the encounter round;
18911,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Jove thund’red; all heaven sad war’s sign resounded.
18912,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"And first Hypsiboas[23] Lichenor[24] wounded,"
18913,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Standing th’ impression of the first in fight.
18914,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"His lance did in his liver’s midst alight,"
18915,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Along his belly. Down he fell; his face
18916,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"His fall on that part sway’d, and all the grace"
18917,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Of his soft hair fil’d with disgraceful dust.
18918,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Then Troglodytes[25] his thick javelin thrust
18919,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"In Pelion’s[26] bosom, bearing him to ground,"
18920,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Whom sad death seiz’d; his soul flew through his wound.
18921,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Seutlæus[27] next Embasichytros slew,"
18922,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,His heart through-thrusting. Then Artophagus[28] threw
18923,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"His lance at Polyphon,[29] and struck him quite"
18924,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Through his mid-belly; down he fell upright,"
18925,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,And from his fair limbs took his soul her flight.
18926,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Limnocharis,[30] beholding Polyphon"
18927,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Thus done to death, did, with as round a stone"
18928,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"As that the mill turns, Troglodytes wound,"
18929,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Near his mid-neck, ere he his onset found;"
18930,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Whose eyes sad darkness seiz’d. Lichenor[31] cast
18931,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"A flying dart off, and his aim so placed"
18932,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Upon Limnocharis; that sure he thought[32]
18933,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,The wound he wish’d him; nor untruly wrought
18934,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"The dire success, for through his liver flew"
18935,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"The fatal lance; which when Crambophagus[33] knew,"
18936,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Down the deep waves near shore he, diving, fled;"
18937,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,But fled not fate so; the stern enemy fed
18938,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Death with his life in diving; never more
18939,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,The air he drew in; his vermilion gore
18940,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Stain’d all the waters, and along the shore"
18941,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,He laid extended; his fat entrails lay
18942,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,(By his small guts’ impulsion) breaking way
18943,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Out at his wound. Limnisius[34] near the shore
18944,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Destroy’d Tyroglyphus. Which frighted sore
18945,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"The soul of Calaminth,[35] seeing coming on,"
18946,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"For wreak, Pternoglyphus;[36] who got him gone"
18947,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"With large leaps to the lake, his target thrown"
18948,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Into the waters. Hydrocharis[37] slew
18949,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"King Pternophagus,[38] at whose throat he threw"
18950,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"A huge stone, strook it high, and beat his brain"
18951,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Out at his nostrils. Earth blush’d with the stain
18952,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"His blood made on her bosom. For next prise,"
18953,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Lichopinax to death did sacrifice
18954,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Borboroccetes’[39] faultless faculties;
18955,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,His lance enforced it; darkness closed his eyes.
18956,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"On which when Prassophagus[40] cast his look,"
18957,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Cnissodioctes[41] by the heels he took,"
18958,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Dragg’d him to fen from off his native ground,"
18959,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Then seized his throat, and soused him till he drown’d"
18960,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"But now Psicharpax wreaks his fellows’ deaths,"
18961,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"And in the bosom of Pelusius[42] sheaths,"
18962,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"In centre of his liver, his bright lance."
18963,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,He fell before the author of the chance;
18964,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,His soul to hell fled. Which Pelobates[43]
18965,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Taking sad note of, wreakfully did seize"
18966,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"His hand’s gripe full of mud, and all besmear’d"
18967,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"His forehead with it so, that scarce appear’d"
18968,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,The light to him. Which certainly incensed
18969,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,His fiery spleen; who with his wreak dispensed
18970,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"No point of time, but rear’d with his strong hand"
18971,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"A stone so massy it oppress’d the land,"
18972,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,And hurl’d it at him; when below the knee
18973,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,It strook his right leg so impetuously
18974,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"It piecemeal brake it; he the dust did seize,"
18975,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Upwards everted. But Craugasides[44]
18976,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Revenged his death, and at his enemy"
18977,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Discharged a dart that did his point imply
18978,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,In his mid-belly. All the sharp-pil’d spear
18979,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Got after in, and did before it bear"
18980,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"His universal entrails to the earth,"
18981,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Soon as his swoln hand gave his jav’lin birth.
18982,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Sitophagus,[45] beholding the sad sight,"
18983,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Set on the shore, went halting from the fight,"
18984,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Vex’d with his wounds extremely; and, to make"
18985,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Way from extreme fate, leap’d into the lake."
18986,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Troxartes strook, in th’ instep’s upper part,"
18987,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Physignathus; who (privy to the smart
18988,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,His wound imparted) with his utmost haste
18989,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Leap’d to the lake, and fled. Troxartes cast"
18990,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"His eye upon the foe that fell before,"
18991,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"And, seeing him half-liv’d, long’d again to gore"
18992,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"His gutless bosom; and, to kill him quite,"
18993,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Ran fiercely at him. Which Prassseus’[46] sight
18994,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Took instant note of, and the first in fight"
18995,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Thrust desp’rate way through, casting his keen lance"
18996,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Off at Troxartes; whose shield turn’d th’ advance
18997,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"The sharp head made, and check’d the mortal chance."
18998,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Amongst the Mice fought an egregious
18999,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Young springall, and a close-encount’ring Mouse,"
19000,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Pure Artepibulus’s[47] dear descent;
19001,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,A prince that Mars himself show’d where he went.
19002,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"(Call’d Meridarpax,[48]) of so huge a might,"
19003,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,That only he still domineer’d in fight
19004,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Of all the Mouse-host. He advancing close
19005,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Up to the lake, past all the rest arose"
19006,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"In glorious object, and made vaunt that he"
19007,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Came to depopulate all the progeny
19008,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Of Frogs, affected with the lance of war."
19009,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,And certainly he had put on as far
19010,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"As he advanced his vaunt, he was endu’d"
19011,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"With so unmatch’d a force and fortitude,"
19012,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Had not the Father both of Gods and men
19013,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Instantly known it, and the Frogs, even then"
19014,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Given up to ruin, rescued with remorse."
19015,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Who, his head moving, thus began discourse:"
19016,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"“No mean amaze affects me, to behold"
19017,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Prince Meridarpax rage so uncontroll’d,"
19018,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"In thirst of Frog-blood, all along the lake."
19019,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Come therefore still, and all addression make,"
19020,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Despatching Pallas, with tumultuous Mars,"
19021,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Down to the field, to make him leave the wars,"
19022,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,How potently soever he be said[49]
19023,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Where he attempts once to uphold his head.”
19024,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Mars answer’d: “O Jove, neither She nor I,"
19025,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"With both our aids, can keep depopulacy"
19026,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"From off the Frogs! And therefore arm we all,"
19027,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Even thy lance letting brandish to his call
19028,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"From off the field, that from the field withdrew"
19029,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"The Titanois, the Titanois that slew,"
19030,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Though most exempt from match of all earth’s Seeds,"
19031,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,So great and so inaccessible deeds
19032,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,It hath proclaim’d to men; bound hand and foot
19033,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,The vast Enceladus; and rac’d by th’ root
19034,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"The race of upland Giants.” This speech past,"
19035,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Saturnius a smoking lightning cast
19036,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Amongst the armies, thund’ring then so sore,"
19037,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,That with a rapting circumflex he bore
19038,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,All huge heaven over. But the terrible ire
19039,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Of his dart, sent abroad, all wrapt in fire,"
19040,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,(Which certainly his very finger was)
19041,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Amazed both Mice and Frogs. Yet soon let pass
19042,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Was all this by the Mice, who much the more"
19043,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Burn’d in desire t’ exterminate the store
19044,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Of all those lance-loved soldiers. Which had been,"
19045,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,If from Olympus Jove’s eye had not seen
19046,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"The Frogs with pity, and with instant speed"
19047,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Sent them assistants. Who, ere any heed"
19048,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Was given to their approach, came crawling on"
19049,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"With anvils on their backs, that, beat upon[50]"
19050,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Never so much, are never wearied yet;"
19051,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Crook-paw’d, and wrested on with foul cloven feet,"
19052,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Tongues in their mouths,[51] brick-back’d, all over bone,"
19053,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Broad shoulder’d, whence a ruddy yellow shone,"
19054,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Distorted, and small-thigh’d; had eyes that saw"
19055,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Out at their bosoms; twice four feet did draw
19056,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"About their bodies; strong-neck’d, whence did rise"
19057,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Two heads; nor could to any hand be prise;
19058,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,They call them lobsters; that ate from the Mice
19059,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Their tails, their feet, and hands, and wrested all"
19060,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Their lances from them, so that cold appall"
19061,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"The wretches put in rout, past all return."
19062,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,And now the Fount of Light forbore to burn
19063,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,"Above the earth; when, which men’s laws commend,"
19064,BATRACHOMYOMACHIA,Our battle in one day took absolute end.

19186,HYMNS,A Hymn to Apollo
19187,HYMNS,
19188,HYMNS,I will remember and express the praise
19189,HYMNS,"Of heaven’s Far-darter, the fair King of days,"
19190,HYMNS,Whom even the Gods themselves fear when he goes
19191,HYMNS,Through Jove’s high house; and when his goodly bows
19192,HYMNS,"He goes to bend, all from their thrones arise,"
19193,HYMNS,"And cluster near, t’ admire his faculties."
19194,HYMNS,Only Latona stirs not from her seat
19195,HYMNS,"Close by the Thund’rer, till her Son’s retreat"
19196,HYMNS,"From his dread archery; but then she goes,"
19197,HYMNS,"Slackens his string, and shuts his quiver close,"
19198,HYMNS,"And (having taken to her hand his bow,"
19199,HYMNS,From off his able shoulders) doth bestow
19200,HYMNS,"Upon a pin of gold the glorious tiller,"
19201,HYMNS,The pin of gold fix’d in his father’s pillar.
19202,HYMNS,"Then doth She to his throne his state uphold,"
19203,HYMNS,"Where his great Father, in a cup of gold,"
19204,HYMNS,"Serves him with nectar, and shows all the grace"
19205,HYMNS,Of his great son. Then th’ other Gods take place;
19206,HYMNS,His gracious mother glorying to bear
19207,HYMNS,"So great an archer, and a son so clear."
19208,HYMNS,"All hail, O blest Latona! to bring forth"
19209,HYMNS,"An issue of such all-out-shining worth,"
19210,HYMNS,"Royal Apollo, and the Queen that loves"
19211,HYMNS,"The hurls of darts. She in th’ Ortygian groves,"
19212,HYMNS,"And he in cliffy Delos, leaning on"
19213,HYMNS,"The lofty Oros, and being built upon"
19214,HYMNS,"By Cynthus’ prominent, that his head rears"
19215,HYMNS,Close to the palm that Inops’ fluent cheers.
19216,HYMNS,"How shall I praise thee, far being worthiest praise,"
19217,HYMNS,O Phœbus? To whose worth the law of lays
19218,HYMNS,"In all kinds is ascrib’d, if feeding flocks"
19219,HYMNS,By continent or isle. All eminent’st rocks
19220,HYMNS,"Did sing for joy, hill-tops, and floods in song"
19221,HYMNS,"Did break their billows, as they flow’d along"
19222,HYMNS,"To serve the sea; the shores, the seas, and all"
19223,HYMNS,Did sing as soon as from the lap did fall
19224,HYMNS,Of blest Latona thee the joy of man.
19225,HYMNS,Her child-bed made the mountain Cynthian
19226,HYMNS,"In rocky Delos, the sea-circled isle,"
19227,HYMNS,"On whose all sides the black seas brake their pile,"
19228,HYMNS,"And overflow’d for joy, so frank a gale"
19229,HYMNS,The singing winds did on their waves exhale.
19230,HYMNS,"Here born, all mortals live in thy commands,"
19231,HYMNS,"Whoever Crete holds, Athens, or the strands"
19232,HYMNS,"Of th’ isle Ægina, or the famous land"
19233,HYMNS,"For ships (Eubœa), or Eresia,"
19234,HYMNS,"Or Peparethus bord’ring on the sea,"
19235,HYMNS,"Ægas, or Athos that doth Thrace divide"
19236,HYMNS,"And Macedon; or Pelion, with the pride"
19237,HYMNS,"Of his high forehead; or the Samian isle,"
19238,HYMNS,That likewise lies near Thrace; or Scyrus’ soil;
19239,HYMNS,Ida’s steep tops; or all that Phocis fill;
19240,HYMNS,"Or Autocanes, with the heaven-high hill;"
19241,HYMNS,Or populous Imber; Lemnos without ports;
19242,HYMNS,"Or Lesbos, fit for the divine resorts;"
19243,HYMNS,And sacred soil of blest Æolion;
19244,HYMNS,Or Chios that exceeds comparison
19245,HYMNS,For fruitfulness; with all the isles that lie
19246,HYMNS,"Embrac’d with seas; Mimas, with rocks so high;"
19247,HYMNS,Or lofty-crown’d Corycius; or the bright
19248,HYMNS,Charos; or Æsagæus’ dazzling height;
19249,HYMNS,"Or watery Samos; Mycale, that bears"
19250,HYMNS,Her brows even with the circles of the spheres;
19251,HYMNS,"Miletus; Cous, that the city is"
19252,HYMNS,Of voice-divided-choice humanities;
19253,HYMNS,"High Cnidus; Carpathus, still strook with wind;"
19254,HYMNS,"Naxos, and Paros; and the rocky-min’d"
19255,HYMNS,Rugged Rhenæa. Yet through all these parts
19256,HYMNS,"Latona, great-grown with the King of darts,"
19257,HYMNS,Travell’d; and tried if any would become
19258,HYMNS,To her dear birth an hospitable home.
19259,HYMNS,"All which extremely trembled, shook with fear,"
19260,HYMNS,Nor durst endure so high a birth to bear
19261,HYMNS,"In their free states, though, for it, they became"
19262,HYMNS,Never so fruitful; till the reverend Dame
19263,HYMNS,"Ascended Delos, and her soil did seize"
19264,HYMNS,With these wing’d words: “O Delos! Wouldst thou please
19265,HYMNS,"To be my son Apollo’s native seat,"
19266,HYMNS,"And build a wealthy fane to one so great,"
19267,HYMNS,No one shall blame or question thy kind deed.
19268,HYMNS,"Nor think I, thou dost sheep or oxen feed"
19269,HYMNS,"In any such store, or in vines exceed,"
19270,HYMNS,"Nor bring’st forth such innumerable plants,"
19271,HYMNS,Which often make the rich inhabitants
19272,HYMNS,Careless of Deity. If thou then shouldst rear
19273,HYMNS,"A fane to Phœbus, all men would confer"
19274,HYMNS,"Whole hecatombs of beeves for sacrifice,"
19275,HYMNS,Still thronging hither; and to thee would rise
19276,HYMNS,"Ever unmeasur’d odours, shouldst thou long"
19277,HYMNS,Nourish thy King thus; and from foreign wrong
19278,HYMNS,The Gods would guard thee; which thine own address
19279,HYMNS,Can never compass for thy barrenness.”
19280,HYMNS,"She said, and Delos joy’d, replying thus:"
19281,HYMNS,“Most happy sister of Saturnius!
19282,HYMNS,I gladly would with all means entertain
19283,HYMNS,"The King your son, being now despised of men,"
19284,HYMNS,But should be honour’d with the greatest then.
19285,HYMNS,"Yet this I fear, nor will conceal from thee:"
19286,HYMNS,"Your son, some say, will author misery"
19287,HYMNS,"In many kinds, as being to sustain"
19288,HYMNS,"A mighty empire over Gods and men,"
19289,HYMNS,Upon the holy-gift-giver the Earth.
19290,HYMNS,"And bitterly I fear that, when his birth"
19291,HYMNS,"Gives him the sight of my so barren soil,"
19292,HYMNS,"He will contemn, and give me up to spoil,"
19293,HYMNS,"Enforce the sea to me, that ever will"
19294,HYMNS,Oppress my heart with many a wat’ry hill.
19295,HYMNS,"And therefore let him choose some other land,"
19296,HYMNS,"Where he shall please, to build at his command"
19297,HYMNS,"Temple and grove, set thick with many a tree."
19298,HYMNS,For wretched polypuses breed in me
19299,HYMNS,"Retiring chambers, and black sea-calves den"
19300,HYMNS,"In my poor soil, for penury of men."
19301,HYMNS,"And yet, O Goddess, wouldst thou please to swear"
19302,HYMNS,"The Gods’ great oath to me, before thou bear"
19303,HYMNS,"Thy blessed son here, that thou wilt erect"
19304,HYMNS,"A fane to him, to render the effect"
19305,HYMNS,"Of men’s demands to them before they fall,"
19306,HYMNS,"Then will thy son’s renown be general,"
19307,HYMNS,"Men will his name in such variety call,"
19308,HYMNS,And I shall then be glad his birth to bear.”
19309,HYMNS,"This said, the Gods’ great oath she thus did swear:"
19310,HYMNS,"“Know this, O Earth! broad heaven’s inferior sphere,"
19311,HYMNS,"And of black Styx the most infernal lake,"
19312,HYMNS,(Which is the gravest oath the Gods can take)
19313,HYMNS,That here shall ever rise to Phœbus’ name
19314,HYMNS,An odorous fane and altar; and thy fame
19315,HYMNS,"Honour, past all isles else, shall see him employ’d.”"
19316,HYMNS,"Her oath thus took and ended, Delos joy’d"
19317,HYMNS,in mighty measure that she should become
19318,HYMNS,To far-shot Phœbus’ birth the famous home.
19319,HYMNS,Latona then nine days and nights did fall
19320,HYMNS,In hopeless labour; at whose birth were all
19321,HYMNS,"Heaven’s most supreme and worthy Goddesses,"
19322,HYMNS,"Dione, Rhæa, and th’ Exploratress"
19323,HYMNS,"Themis, and Amphitrite that will be"
19324,HYMNS,"Pursu’d with sighs still; every Deity,"
19325,HYMNS,"Except the snowy-wristed wife of Jove,"
19326,HYMNS,"Who held her moods aloft, and would not move;"
19327,HYMNS,Only Lucina (to whose virtue vows
19328,HYMNS,"Each childbirth patient) heard not of her throes,"
19329,HYMNS,"But sat, by Juno’s counsel, on the brows"
19330,HYMNS,"Of broad Olympus, wrapp’d in clouds of gold."
19331,HYMNS,"Whom Jove’s proud wife in envy did withhold,"
19332,HYMNS,Because bright-lock’d Latona was to bear
19333,HYMNS,A son so faultless and in force so clear.
19334,HYMNS,"The rest Thaumantia sent before, to bring"
19335,HYMNS,"Lucina to release the envied king,"
19336,HYMNS,"Assuring her, that they would straight confer"
19337,HYMNS,"A carcanet, nine cubits long, on her,"
19338,HYMNS,"All woven with wires of gold. But charg’d her, then,"
19339,HYMNS,To call apart from th’ ivory-wristed Queen
19340,HYMNS,"The childbirth-guiding Goddess, for just fear"
19341,HYMNS,"Lest, her charge utter’d in Saturnia’s ear,"
19342,HYMNS,"She, after, might dissuade her from descent."
19343,HYMNS,When wind-swift-footed Iris knew th’ intent
19344,HYMNS,"Of th’ other Goddesses, away she went,"
19345,HYMNS,And instantly she pass’d the infinite space
19346,HYMNS,"’Twixt earth and heaven; when, coming to the place"
19347,HYMNS,"Where dwelt th’ Immortals, straight without the gate"
19348,HYMNS,"She gat Lucina, and did all relate"
19349,HYMNS,"The Goddesses commanded, and inclin’d"
19350,HYMNS,To all that they demanded her dear mind.
19351,HYMNS,"And on their way they went, like those two doves"
19352,HYMNS,"That, walking highways, every shadow moves"
19353,HYMNS,"Up from the earth, forc’d with their natural fear."
19354,HYMNS,"When ent’ring Delos, She, that is so dear"
19355,HYMNS,"To dames in labour, made Latona straight"
19356,HYMNS,"Prone to delivery, and to wield the weight"
19357,HYMNS,Of her dear burthen with a world of ease.
19358,HYMNS,"When, with her fair hand, she a palm did seize,"
19359,HYMNS,"And, staying her by it, stuck her tender knees"
19360,HYMNS,"Amidst the soft mead, that did smile beneath"
19361,HYMNS,Her sacred labour; and the child did breathe
19362,HYMNS,The air in th’ instant. All the Goddesses
19363,HYMNS,"Brake in kind tears and shrieks for her quick ease,"
19364,HYMNS,"And thee, O archer Phœbus, with waves clear"
19365,HYMNS,"Wash’d sweetly over, swaddled with sincere"
19366,HYMNS,And spotless swathbands; and made then to flow
19367,HYMNS,"About thy breast a mantle, white as snow,"
19368,HYMNS,"Fine, and new made; and cast a veil of gold"
19369,HYMNS,Over thy forehead. Nor yet forth did hold
19370,HYMNS,"Thy mother for thy food her golden breast,"
19371,HYMNS,"But Themis, in supply of it, address’d"
19372,HYMNS,"Lovely Ambrosia, and drunk off to thee"
19373,HYMNS,"A bowl of nectar, interchangeably"
19374,HYMNS,With her immortal fingers serving thine.
19375,HYMNS,"And when, O Phœbus, that eternal wine"
19376,HYMNS,"Thy taste had relish’d, and that food divine,"
19377,HYMNS,No golden swathband longer could contain
19378,HYMNS,Thy panting bosom; all that would constrain
19379,HYMNS,"Thy soon-eas’d Godhead, every feeble chain"
19380,HYMNS,"Of earthy child-rites, flew in sunder all."
19381,HYMNS,And then didst thou thus to the Deities call:
19382,HYMNS,"“Let there be given me my lov’d lute and bow,"
19383,HYMNS,"I’ll prophesy to men, and make them know"
19384,HYMNS,"Jove’s perfect counsels.” This said, up did fly"
19385,HYMNS,"From broad-way’d Earth the unshorn Deity,"
19386,HYMNS,Far-shot Apollo. All th’ Immortals stood
19387,HYMNS,In steep amaze to see Latona’s brood.
19388,HYMNS,"All Delos, looking on him, all with gold"
19389,HYMNS,"Was loaden straight, and joy’d to be extoll’d"
19390,HYMNS,"By great Latona so, that she decreed"
19391,HYMNS,Her barrenness should bear the fruitful’st seed
19392,HYMNS,"Of all the isles and continents of earth,"
19393,HYMNS,And lov’d her from her heart so for her birth.
19394,HYMNS,"For so she flourish’d, as a hill that stood"
19395,HYMNS,Crown’d with the flow’r of an abundant wood.
19396,HYMNS,"And thou, O Phœbus, bearing in thy hand"
19397,HYMNS,"Thy silver bow, walk’st over every land,"
19398,HYMNS,Sometimes ascend’st the rough-hewn rocky hill
19399,HYMNS,"Of desolate Cynthus, and sometimes tak’st will"
19400,HYMNS,"To visit islands, and the plumps of men."
19401,HYMNS,"And many a temple, all ways, men ordain"
19402,HYMNS,"To thy bright Godhead; groves, made dark with trees,"
19403,HYMNS,"And never shorn, to hide the Deities,"
19404,HYMNS,"All high-lov’d prospects, all the steepest brows"
19405,HYMNS,"Of far-seen hills, and every flood that flows"
19406,HYMNS,"Forth to the sea, are dedicate to thee."
19407,HYMNS,But most of all thy mind’s alacrity
19408,HYMNS,"Is rais’d with Delos; since, to fill thy fane,"
19409,HYMNS,"There flocks so many an Ionian,"
19410,HYMNS,"With ample gowns that flow down to their feet,"
19411,HYMNS,"With all their children, and the reverend sweet"
19412,HYMNS,Of all their pious wives. And these are they
19413,HYMNS,That (mindful of thee) even thy Deity
19414,HYMNS,"Render more spritely with their champion fight,"
19415,HYMNS,"Dances, and songs, perform’d to glorious sight,"
19416,HYMNS,"Once having publish’d, and proclaim’d their strife."
19417,HYMNS,And these are acted with such exquisite life
19418,HYMNS,"That one would say, “Now, the Ionian strains"
19419,HYMNS,"Are turn’d Immortals, nor know what age means.”"
19420,HYMNS,"His mind would take such pleasure from his eye,"
19421,HYMNS,"To see them serv’d by all mortality,"
19422,HYMNS,"Their men so human, women so well grac’d,"
19423,HYMNS,"Their ships so swift, their riches so increas’d,"
19424,HYMNS,"Since thy observance, who, being all before"
19425,HYMNS,"Thy opposites, were all despis’d and poor."
19426,HYMNS,"And to all these this absolute wonder add,"
19427,HYMNS,Whose praise shall render all posterities glad:
19428,HYMNS,"The Delian virgins are thy handmaids all,"
19429,HYMNS,"And, since they serv’d Apollo, jointly fall"
19430,HYMNS,"Before Latona, and Diana too,"
19431,HYMNS,"In sacred service, and do therefore know"
19432,HYMNS,How to make mention of the ancient trims
19433,HYMNS,"Of men and women, in their well-made hymns,"
19434,HYMNS,"And soften barbarous nations with their songs,"
19435,HYMNS,Being able all to speak the several tongues
19436,HYMNS,"Of foreign nations, and to imitate"
19437,HYMNS,"Their musics there, with art so fortunate"
19438,HYMNS,"That one would say, there everyone did speak,"
19439,HYMNS,"And all their tunes in natural accents break,"
19440,HYMNS,"Their songs so well compos’d are, and their art"
19441,HYMNS,To answer all sounds is of such desert.
19442,HYMNS,"But come, Latona, and thou King of flames,"
19443,HYMNS,"With Phœbe, rect’ress of chaste thoughts in dames"
19444,HYMNS,"Let me salute ye, and your graces call"
19445,HYMNS,Hereafter to my just memorial.
19446,HYMNS,"And you, O Delian virgins, do me grace,"
19447,HYMNS,"When any stranger of our earthy race,"
19448,HYMNS,"Whose restless life affliction hath in chace,"
19449,HYMNS,"Shall hither come and question you, who is,"
19450,HYMNS,"To your chaste ears, of choicest faculties"
19451,HYMNS,"In sacred poesy, and with most right"
19452,HYMNS,"Is author of your absolut’st delight,"
19453,HYMNS,Ye shall yourselves do all the right ye can
19454,HYMNS,To answer for our name:—“The sightless man
19455,HYMNS,Of stony Chios. All whose poems shall
19456,HYMNS,In all last ages stand for capital.”
19457,HYMNS,"This for your own sakes I desire, for I"
19458,HYMNS,Will propagate mine own precedency
19459,HYMNS,"As far as earth shall well-built cities bear,"
19460,HYMNS,"Or human conversation is held dear,"
19461,HYMNS,"Not with my praise direct, but praises due,"
19462,HYMNS,"And men shall credit it, because ’tis true."
19463,HYMNS,"However, I’ll not cease the praise I vow"
19464,HYMNS,"To far-shot Phœbus with the silver bow,"
19465,HYMNS,Whom lovely-hair’d Latona gave the light.
19466,HYMNS,"O King! both Lycia is in rule thy right,"
19467,HYMNS,"Fair Mœony, and the maritimal"
19468,HYMNS,"Miletus, wish’d to be the seat of all."
19469,HYMNS,"But chiefly Delos, girt with billows round,"
19470,HYMNS,Thy most respected empire doth resound.
19471,HYMNS,"Where thou to Pythus went’st, to answer there,"
19472,HYMNS,"As soon as thou wert born, the burning ear"
19473,HYMNS,"Of many a far-come, to hear future deeds,"
19474,HYMNS,"Clad in divine and odoriferous weeds,"
19475,HYMNS,And with thy golden fescue play’dst upon
19476,HYMNS,"Thy hollow harp, that sounds to heaven set gone."
19477,HYMNS,"Then to Olympus swift as thought he flew,"
19478,HYMNS,"To Jove’s high house, and had a retinue"
19479,HYMNS,Of Gods t’ attend him; and then straight did fall
19480,HYMNS,"To study of the harp, and harpsical,"
19481,HYMNS,All th’ Immortals. To whom every Muse
19482,HYMNS,"With ravishing voices did their answers use,"
19483,HYMNS,"Singing th’ eternal deeds of Deity,"
19484,HYMNS,And from their hands what hells of misery
19485,HYMNS,"Poor humans suffer, living desperate quite,"
19486,HYMNS,"And not an art they have, wit, or deceit,"
19487,HYMNS,"Can make them manage any act aright,"
19488,HYMNS,"Nor find, with all the soul they can engage,"
19489,HYMNS,"A salve for death, or remedy for age."
19490,HYMNS,"But here the fair-hair’d Graces, the wise Hours,"
19491,HYMNS,"Harmonia, Hebe, and sweet Venus’ pow’rs,"
19492,HYMNS,"Danc’d, and each other’s palm to palm did cling."
19493,HYMNS,"And with these danc’d not a deformed thing,"
19494,HYMNS,"No forespoke dwarf, nor downward witherling,"
19495,HYMNS,"But all with wond’rous goodly forms were deckt,"
19496,HYMNS,And mov’d with beauties of unpriz’d aspect.
19497,HYMNS,"Dart-dear Diana, even with Phœbus bred,"
19498,HYMNS,Danc’d likewise there; and Mars a march did tread
19499,HYMNS,With that brave bevy. In whose consort fell
19500,HYMNS,"Argicides, th’ ingenious sentinel."
19501,HYMNS,Phœbus-Apollo touch’d his lute to them
19502,HYMNS,"Sweetly and softly, a most glorious beam"
19503,HYMNS,"Casting about him, as he danc’d and play’d,"
19504,HYMNS,And even his feet were all with rays array’d;
19505,HYMNS,His weed and all of a most curious trim
19506,HYMNS,With no less lustre grac’d and circled him.
19507,HYMNS,"By these Latona, with a hair that shin’d"
19508,HYMNS,"Like burnish’d gold, and, with the mighty mind;"
19509,HYMNS,"Heaven’s counsellor, Jove, sat with delightsome eyes;"
19510,HYMNS,To see their son new rank’d with Deities.
19511,HYMNS,"How shall I praise thee, then, that art all praise?"
19512,HYMNS,Amongst the brides shall I thy Deity raise?
19513,HYMNS,"Or being in love, when sad thou went’st to woo"
19514,HYMNS,"The virgin Aza, and didst overthrow"
19515,HYMNS,"The even-with-Gods, Elation’s mighty seed,"
19516,HYMNS,"That had of goodly horse so brave a breed,"
19517,HYMNS,"And Phorbas, son of sovereign Triopus,"
19518,HYMNS,"Valiant Leucippus, and Ereutheus,"
19519,HYMNS,"And Triopus himself with equal fall,"
19520,HYMNS,"Thou but on foot, and they on horseback all?"
19521,HYMNS,"Or shall I sing thee, as thou first didst grace"
19522,HYMNS,"Earth with thy foot, to find thee forth a place"
19523,HYMNS,Fit to pronounce thy oracles to men?
19524,HYMNS,First from Olympus thou alightedst then
19525,HYMNS,"Into Pieria, passing all the land"
19526,HYMNS,"Of fruitless Lesbos, chok’d with drifts of sand,"
19527,HYMNS,"The Magnets likewise, and the Perrhæbes;"
19528,HYMNS,"And to Iolcus variedst thy access,"
19529,HYMNS,"Cenæus’ tops ascending, that their base"
19530,HYMNS,"Make bright Eubœa, being of ships the grace,"
19531,HYMNS,"And fix’d thy fair stand in Lelantus’ field,"
19532,HYMNS,That did not yet thy mind’s contentment yield
19533,HYMNS,"To raise a fane on, and a sacred grove."
19534,HYMNS,"Passing Euripus then, thou mad’st remove"
19535,HYMNS,Up to earth’s ever-green and holiest hill.
19536,HYMNS,"Yet swiftly thence, too, thou transcendedst still"
19537,HYMNS,"To Mycalessus, and didst touch upon"
19538,HYMNS,"Teumessus, apt to make green couches on,"
19539,HYMNS,And flowery field-beds. Then thy progress found
19540,HYMNS,"Thebes out, whose soil with only woods was crown’d,"
19541,HYMNS,"For yet was sacred Thebes no human seat,"
19542,HYMNS,And therefore were no paths nor highways beat
19543,HYMNS,"On her free bosom, that flows now with wheat,"
19544,HYMNS,But then she only wore on it a wood.
19545,HYMNS,"From hence (even loth to part, because it stood"
19546,HYMNS,Fit for thy service) thou putt’st on remove
19547,HYMNS,"To green Onchestus, Neptune’s glorious grove,"
19548,HYMNS,"Where new-tam’d horse, bred, nourish nerves so rare"
19549,HYMNS,"That still they frolic, though they travell’d are"
19550,HYMNS,"Never so sore, and hurry after them"
19551,HYMNS,"Most heavy coaches, but are so extreme"
19552,HYMNS,"(In usual travel) fiery and free,"
19553,HYMNS,That though their coachman ne’er so masterly
19554,HYMNS,"Governs their courages, he sometimes must"
19555,HYMNS,"Forsake his seat, and give their spirits their lust,"
19556,HYMNS,"When after them their empty coach they draw,"
19557,HYMNS,"Foaming, and neighing, quite exempt from awe."
19558,HYMNS,And if their coachman guide through any grove
19559,HYMNS,"Unshorn, and vow’d to any Deity’s love,"
19560,HYMNS,"The lords encoach’d leap out, and all their care"
19561,HYMNS,"Use to allay their fires, with speaking fair"
19562,HYMNS,"Stroking and trimming them, and in some queach,"
19563,HYMNS,"Or strength of shade, within their nearest reach,"
19564,HYMNS,"Reining them up, invoke the deified King"
19565,HYMNS,"Of that unshorn and everlasting spring,"
19566,HYMNS,"And leave them then to her preserving hands,"
19567,HYMNS,Who is the Fate that there the God commands.
19568,HYMNS,And this was first the sacred fashion there.
19569,HYMNS,"From hence thou went’st, O thou in shafts past peer,"
19570,HYMNS,"And found’st Cephissus with thy all-seeing beams,"
19571,HYMNS,"Whose flood affects so many silver streams,"
19572,HYMNS,And from Lilæus pours so bright a wave.
19573,HYMNS,"Yet forth thy foot flew, and thy fair eyes gave"
19574,HYMNS,The view of Ocale the rich in tow’rs;
19575,HYMNS,"Then to Amartus that abounds in flow’rs,"
19576,HYMNS,"Then to Delphusa putt’st thy progress on,"
19577,HYMNS,Whose blessed soil nought harmful breeds upon;
19578,HYMNS,"And there thy pleasure would a fane adorn,"
19579,HYMNS,And nourish woods whose shades should ne’er be shorn.
19580,HYMNS,"Where this thou told’st her, standing to her close:"
19581,HYMNS,"“Delphusa, here I entertain suppose"
19582,HYMNS,"To build a far-fam’d temple, and ordain"
19583,HYMNS,"An oracle t’ inform the minds of men,"
19584,HYMNS,Who shall for ever offer to my love
19585,HYMNS,Whole hecatombs; even all the men that move
19586,HYMNS,"In rich Peloponnesus, and all those"
19587,HYMNS,"Of Europe, and the isles the seas enclose,"
19588,HYMNS,Whom future search of acts and beings brings.
19589,HYMNS,To whom I’ll prophesy the truths of things
19590,HYMNS,In that rich temple where my oracle sings.”
19591,HYMNS,"This said, the All-bounds-reacher, with his bow,"
19592,HYMNS,The fane’s divine foundations did foreshow;
19593,HYMNS,"Ample they were, and did huge length impart,"
19594,HYMNS,"With a continuate tenour, full of art."
19595,HYMNS,"But when Delphusa look’d into his end,"
19596,HYMNS,"Her heart grew angry, and did thus extend"
19597,HYMNS,"Itself to Phœbus: “Phœbus, since thy mind"
19598,HYMNS,A far-fam’d fane hath in itself design’d
19599,HYMNS,"To bear an oracle to men in me,"
19600,HYMNS,"That hecatombs may put in fire to thee,"
19601,HYMNS,"This let me tell thee, and impose for stay"
19602,HYMNS,Upon thy purpose: Th’ inarticulate neigh
19603,HYMNS,Of fire-hov’d horse will ever disobey
19604,HYMNS,"Thy numerous ear, and mules will for their drink"
19605,HYMNS,"Trouble my sacred springs, and I should think"
19606,HYMNS,That any of the human race had rather
19607,HYMNS,"See here the hurries of rich coaches gather,"
19608,HYMNS,"And hear the haughty neighs of swift-hov’d horse,"
19609,HYMNS,Than in his pleasure’s place convert recourse
19610,HYMNS,T’a mighty temple; and his wealth bestow
19611,HYMNS,"On pieties, where his sports may freely flow,"
19612,HYMNS,Or see huge wealth that he shall never owe.
19613,HYMNS,"And, therefore, wouldst thou hear my free advice,—"
19614,HYMNS,"Though mightier far thou art, and much more wise,"
19615,HYMNS,"O king, than I, thy pow’r being great’st of all"
19616,HYMNS,"In Crissa, underneath the bosom’s fall"
19617,HYMNS,"Of steep Parnassus,—let thy mind be given"
19618,HYMNS,"To set thee up a fane, where never driven"
19619,HYMNS,"Shall glorious coaches be, nor horses’ neighs"
19620,HYMNS,"Storm near thy well-built altars, but thy praise"
19621,HYMNS,Let the fair race of pious humans bring
19622,HYMNS,"Into thy fane, that Io-pæans sing."
19623,HYMNS,And those gifts only let thy deified mind
19624,HYMNS,"Be circularly pleas’d with, being the kind"
19625,HYMNS,And fair burnt-offerings that true Deities bind.”
19626,HYMNS,"With this his mind she altered, though she spake"
19627,HYMNS,"Not for his good, but her own glory’s sake."
19628,HYMNS,"From hence, O Phœbus, first thou mad’st retreat,"
19629,HYMNS,"And of the Phlegians reached the walled seat,"
19630,HYMNS,"Inhabited with contumelious men,"
19631,HYMNS,"Who, slighting Jove, took up their dwellings then"
19632,HYMNS,"Within a large cave, near Cephissus’ lake."
19633,HYMNS,"Hence, swiftly moving, thou all speed didst make"
19634,HYMNS,"Up to the tops intended, and the ground"
19635,HYMNS,"Of Crissa, under the-with-snow-still-crown’d"
19636,HYMNS,"Parnassus, reach’d, whose face affects the West;"
19637,HYMNS,"Above which hangs a rock, that still seems prest"
19638,HYMNS,"To fall upon it, through whose breast doth run"
19639,HYMNS,"A rocky cave, near which the King the Sun"
19640,HYMNS,"Cast to contrive a temple to his mind,"
19641,HYMNS,"And said, “Now here stands my conceit inclin’d"
19642,HYMNS,"To build a famous fane, where still shall be"
19643,HYMNS,"An oracle to men, that still to me"
19644,HYMNS,"Shall offer absolute hecatombs, as well"
19645,HYMNS,Those that in rich Peloponnesus dwell
19646,HYMNS,"As those of Europe, and the isles that lie"
19647,HYMNS,"Wall’d with the sea, that all their pains apply"
19648,HYMNS,T’ employ my counsels. To all which will I
19649,HYMNS,"True secrets tell, by way of prophecy,"
19650,HYMNS,"In my rich temple, that shall ever be"
19651,HYMNS,An oracle to all posterity.”
19652,HYMNS,"This said, the fane’s form he did straight present,"
19653,HYMNS,"Ample, and of a length of great extent;"
19654,HYMNS,"In which Trophonius and Agamede,"
19655,HYMNS,"Who of Erginus were the famous seed,"
19656,HYMNS,"Impos’d the stony entry, and the heart"
19657,HYMNS,Of every God had for their excellent art.
19658,HYMNS,About the temple dwelt of human name
19659,HYMNS,"Unnumber’d nations, it acquired such fame,"
19660,HYMNS,"Being all of stone, built for eternal date."
19661,HYMNS,And near it did a fountain propagate
19662,HYMNS,"A fair stream far away; when Jove’s bright seed,"
19663,HYMNS,"The King Apollo, with an arrow, freed"
19664,HYMNS,"From his strong string, destroy’d the Dragoness"
19665,HYMNS,"That wonder nourish’d, being of such excess"
19666,HYMNS,"In size, and horridness of monstrous shape,"
19667,HYMNS,"That on the forc’d earth she wrought many a rape,"
19668,HYMNS,"Many a spoil made on it, many an ill"
19669,HYMNS,"On crook-haunch’d herds brought, being impurpled still"
19670,HYMNS,With blood of all sorts; having undergone
19671,HYMNS,"The charge of Juno, with the golden throne,"
19672,HYMNS,"To nourish Typhon, the abhorr’d affright"
19673,HYMNS,"And bane of mortals, whom into the light"
19674,HYMNS,"Saturnia brought forth, being incensed with Jove,"
19675,HYMNS,Because the most renown’d fruit of his love
19676,HYMNS,"(Pallas) he got, and shook out of his brain."
19677,HYMNS,For which majestic Juno did complain
19678,HYMNS,In this kind to the Bless’d Court of the skies:
19679,HYMNS,"“Know all ye sex-distinguish’d Deities,"
19680,HYMNS,"That Jove, assembler of the cloudy throng,"
19681,HYMNS,"Begins with me first, and affects with wrong"
19682,HYMNS,"My right in him, made by himself his wife,"
19683,HYMNS,That knows and does the honour’d marriage life
19684,HYMNS,All honest offices; and yet hath he
19685,HYMNS,"Unduly got, without my company,"
19686,HYMNS,"Blue-eyed Minerva, who of all the sky"
19687,HYMNS,Of blest Immortals is the absolute grace;
19688,HYMNS,Where I have brought into the Heavenly Race
19689,HYMNS,"A son, both taken in his feet and head,"
19690,HYMNS,"So ugly, and so far from worth my bed,"
19691,HYMNS,"That, ravish’d into hand, I took and threw"
19692,HYMNS,Down to the vast sea his detested view;
19693,HYMNS,"Where Nereus’ daughter, Thetis, who her way"
19694,HYMNS,"With silver feet makes, and the fair array"
19695,HYMNS,"Of her bright sisters, saved, and took to guard."
19696,HYMNS,"But, would to heaven, another yet were spared"
19697,HYMNS,"The like grace of his godhead! Crafty mate,"
19698,HYMNS,What other scape canst thou excogitate?
19699,HYMNS,How could thy heart sustain to get alone
19700,HYMNS,The grey-eyed Goddess? Her conception
19701,HYMNS,"Nor bringing forth had any hand of mine,"
19702,HYMNS,"And yet, know all the Gods, I go for thine"
19703,HYMNS,To such kind uses. But I’ll now employ
19704,HYMNS,"My brain to procreate a masculine joy,"
19705,HYMNS,"That ’mongst th’ Immortals may as eminent shine,"
19706,HYMNS,With shame affecting nor my bed nor thine.
19707,HYMNS,"Nor will I ever touch at thine again,"
19708,HYMNS,But far fly it and thee; and yet will reign
19709,HYMNS,Amongst th’ Immortals ever.” This spleen spent
19710,HYMNS,(Still yet left angry) far away she went
19711,HYMNS,"From all the Deathless, and yet pray’d to all,"
19712,HYMNS,"Advanced her hand, and, ere she let it fall,"
19713,HYMNS,"Used these excitements: “Hear me now, O Earth!"
19714,HYMNS,"Broad Heaven above it, and beneath, your birth,"
19715,HYMNS,"The deified Titanois, that dwell about"
19716,HYMNS,"Vast Tartarus, from whence sprung all the rout"
19717,HYMNS,"Of Men and Deities! Hear me all, I say,"
19718,HYMNS,"With all your forces, and give instant way"
19719,HYMNS,"T’ a son of mine without Jove, who yet may"
19720,HYMNS,"Nothing inferior prove in force to him,"
19721,HYMNS,But past him spring as far in able limb
19722,HYMNS,"As he past Saturn.” This pronounced, she strook"
19723,HYMNS,"Life-bearing Earth so strongly, that she shook"
19724,HYMNS,"Beneath her numb’d hand. Which when she beheld,"
19725,HYMNS,"Her bosom with abundant comforts swell’d,"
19726,HYMNS,In hope all should to her desire extend.
19727,HYMNS,"From hence the year, that all such proofs gives end,"
19728,HYMNS,Grew round; yet all that time the bed of Jove
19729,HYMNS,"She never touch’d at, never was her love"
19730,HYMNS,"Enflam’d to sit near his Dædalian throne,"
19731,HYMNS,"As she accustomed, to consult upon"
19732,HYMNS,"Counsels kept dark with many a secret skill,"
19733,HYMNS,"But kept her vow-frequented temple still,"
19734,HYMNS,"Pleas’d with her sacrifice; till now, the nights"
19735,HYMNS,"And days accomplish’d, and the year’s whole rights"
19736,HYMNS,"In all her revolutions being expired,"
19737,HYMNS,The hours and all run out that were required
19738,HYMNS,"To vent a birth-right, she brought forth a son,"
19739,HYMNS,"Like Gods or men in no condition,"
19740,HYMNS,"But a most dreadful and pernicious thing,"
19741,HYMNS,"Call’d Typhon, who on all the human spring"
19742,HYMNS,Conferr’d confusion. Which received to hand
19743,HYMNS,"By Juno, instantly she gave command"
19744,HYMNS,(Ill to ill adding) that the Dragoness
19745,HYMNS,"Should bring it up; who took, and did oppress"
19746,HYMNS,With many a misery (to maintain th’ excess
19747,HYMNS,Of that inhuman monster) all the race
19748,HYMNS,"Of men that were of all the world the grace,"
19749,HYMNS,Till the far-working Phœbus at her sent
19750,HYMNS,"A fiery arrow, that invoked event"
19751,HYMNS,Of death gave to her execrable life.
19752,HYMNS,"Before which yet she lay in bitter strife,"
19753,HYMNS,"With dying pains, grovelling on earth, and drew"
19754,HYMNS,Extreme short respirations; for which flew
19755,HYMNS,"A shout about the air, whence no man knew,"
19756,HYMNS,But came by power divine. And then she lay
19757,HYMNS,"Tumbling her trunk, and winding every way"
19758,HYMNS,"About her nasty nest, quite leaving then"
19759,HYMNS,"Her murderous life, embrued with deaths of men."
19760,HYMNS,"Then Phœbus gloried, saying: “Thyself now lie"
19761,HYMNS,"On men-sustaining earth, and putrefy,"
19762,HYMNS,Who first of putrefaction was inform’d.
19763,HYMNS,"Now on thy life have death’s cold vapours storm’d,"
19764,HYMNS,"That storm’dst on men the earth-fed so much death,"
19765,HYMNS,In envy of the offspring they made breathe
19766,HYMNS,Their lives out on my altars. Now from thee
19767,HYMNS,Not Typhon shall enforce the misery
19768,HYMNS,"Of merited death, nor She, whose name implies"
19769,HYMNS,"Such scathe (Chimæra), but black earth make prise"
19770,HYMNS,"To putrefaction thy immanities,"
19771,HYMNS,"And bright Hyperion, that light all eyes shows,"
19772,HYMNS,Thine with a night of rottenness shall close.”
19773,HYMNS,Thus spake he glorying. And then seiz’d upon
19774,HYMNS,"Her horrid heap, with putrefaction,"
19775,HYMNS,Hyperion’s lovely pow’rs; from whence her name
19776,HYMNS,"Took sound of Python, and heaven’s Sovereign Flame"
19777,HYMNS,"Was surnam’d Pythius, since the sharp-eyed Sun"
19778,HYMNS,Affected so with putrefaction
19779,HYMNS,The hellish monster. And now Phœbus’ mind
19780,HYMNS,Gave him to know that falsehood had strook blind
19781,HYMNS,"Even his bright eye, because it could not find"
19782,HYMNS,"The subtle Fountain’s fraud; to whom he flew,"
19783,HYMNS,"Enflamed with anger, and in th’ instant drew"
19784,HYMNS,"Close to Delphusa, using this short vow:"
19785,HYMNS,“Delphusa! You must look no longer now
19786,HYMNS,To vent your frauds on me; for well I know
19787,HYMNS,"Your situation to be lovely, worth"
19788,HYMNS,"A temple’s imposition, it pours forth"
19789,HYMNS,So delicate a stream. But your renown
19790,HYMNS,"Shall now no longer shine here, but mine own.”"
19791,HYMNS,"This said, he thrust her promontory down,"
19792,HYMNS,"And damm’d her fountain up with mighty stones,"
19793,HYMNS,A temple giving consecrations
19794,HYMNS,In woods adjoining. And in this fane all
19795,HYMNS,"On him, by surname of Delphusius, call,"
19796,HYMNS,Because Delphusa’s sacred flood and fame
19797,HYMNS,"His wrath affected so, and hid in shame."
19798,HYMNS,And then thought Phœbus what descent of men
19799,HYMNS,"To be his ministers he should retain,"
19800,HYMNS,To do in stony Pythos sacrifice.
19801,HYMNS,"To which his mind contending, his quick eyes"
19802,HYMNS,"He cast upon the blue sea, and beheld"
19803,HYMNS,"A ship, on whose masts sails that wing’d it swell’d,"
19804,HYMNS,"In which were men transferr’d, many and good,"
19805,HYMNS,"That in Minoian Cnossus ate their food,"
19806,HYMNS,And were Cretensians; who now are those
19807,HYMNS,"That all the sacrificing dues dispose,"
19808,HYMNS,And all the laws deliver to a word
19809,HYMNS,"Of Day’s great King, that wears the golden sword,"
19810,HYMNS,And oracles (out of his Delphian tree
19811,HYMNS,That shrouds her fair arms in the cavity
19812,HYMNS,Beneath Parnassus’ mount) pronounce to men.
19813,HYMNS,"These now his priests, that lived as merchants then,"
19814,HYMNS,"In traffics and pecuniary rates,"
19815,HYMNS,For sandy Pylos and the Pylian states.
19816,HYMNS,Were under sail. But now encounter’d them
19817,HYMNS,"Phœbus-Apollo, who into the stream"
19818,HYMNS,"Cast himself headlong, and the strange disguise"
19819,HYMNS,Took of a dolphin of a goodly size.
19820,HYMNS,"Like which he leap’d into their ship, and lay"
19821,HYMNS,As an ostent of infinite dismay.
19822,HYMNS,For none with any strife of mind could look
19823,HYMNS,"Into the omen, all the ship-masts shook,"
19824,HYMNS,"And silent all sat with the fear they took,"
19825,HYMNS,"Arm’d not, nor strook they sail, but as before"
19826,HYMNS,"Went on with full trim, and a foreright blore,"
19827,HYMNS,"Stiff, and from forth the south, the ship made fly."
19828,HYMNS,"When first they stripp’d the Malean promont’ry,"
19829,HYMNS,"Touch’d at Laconia’s soil, in which a town"
19830,HYMNS,"Their ship arriv’d at, that the sea doth crown,"
19831,HYMNS,"Called Tenarus, a place of much delight"
19832,HYMNS,To men that serve Heaven’s Comforter of sight.
19833,HYMNS,In which are fed the famous flocks that bear
19834,HYMNS,"The wealthy fleeces, on a delicate lair"
19835,HYMNS,Being fed and seated. Where the merchants fain
19836,HYMNS,"Would have put in, that they might out again"
19837,HYMNS,"To tell the miracle that chanced to them,"
19838,HYMNS,"And try if it would take the sacred stream,"
19839,HYMNS,"Rushing far forth, that he again might bear"
19840,HYMNS,Those other fishes that abounded there
19841,HYMNS,"Delightsome company, or still would stay"
19842,HYMNS,"Aboard their dry ship. But it fail’d t’ obey,"
19843,HYMNS,And for the rich Peloponnesian shore
19844,HYMNS,Steer’d her free sail; Apollo made the blore
19845,HYMNS,Directly guide it. That obeying still
19846,HYMNS,"Reach’d dry Arena, and (what wish doth fill)"
19847,HYMNS,"Fair Argyphæa, and the populous height"
19848,HYMNS,"Of Thryus, whose stream, siding her, doth wait"
19849,HYMNS,"With safe pass on Alphæus, Pylos’ sands,"
19850,HYMNS,And Pylian dwellers; keeping by the strands
19851,HYMNS,"On which th’ inhabitants of Crunius dwell,"
19852,HYMNS,And Helida set opposite to hell;
19853,HYMNS,"Chalcis and Dymes reach’d, and happily"
19854,HYMNS,Made sail by Pheras; all being overjoy’d
19855,HYMNS,With that frank gale that Jove himself employ’d.
19856,HYMNS,And then amongst the clouds they might descry
19857,HYMNS,"The hill, that far-seen Ithaca calls her Eye,"
19858,HYMNS,"Dulichius, Samos, and, with timber graced,"
19859,HYMNS,Shady Zacynthus. But when now they past
19860,HYMNS,"Peloponnesus all, and then when show’d"
19861,HYMNS,"The infinite vale of Crissa, that doth shroud"
19862,HYMNS,"All rich Morea with her liberal breast,"
19863,HYMNS,So frank a gale there flew out of the West
19864,HYMNS,"As all the sky discover’d; ’twas so great,"
19865,HYMNS,And blew so from the very council seat
19866,HYMNS,"Of Jove himself, that quickly it might send"
19867,HYMNS,The ship through full seas to her journey’s end.
19868,HYMNS,"From thence they sail’d, quite opposite, to the East,"
19869,HYMNS,"And to the region where Light leaves his rest,"
19870,HYMNS,"The Light himself being sacred pilot there,"
19871,HYMNS,And made the sea-trod ship arrive them near
19872,HYMNS,"The grapeful Crissa, where he rest doth take"
19873,HYMNS,Close to her port and sands. And then forth brake
19874,HYMNS,"The far-shot King, like to a star that strows"
19875,HYMNS,"His glorious forehead where the mid-day glows,"
19876,HYMNS,"That all in sparkles did his state attire,"
19877,HYMNS,Whose lustre leap’d up to the sphere of fire.
19878,HYMNS,"He trod where no way oped, and pierced the place"
19879,HYMNS,"That of his sacred tripods held the grace,"
19880,HYMNS,In which he lighted such a fluent flame
19881,HYMNS,"As gilt all Crissa; in which every dame,"
19882,HYMNS,"And dame’s fair daughter, cast out vehement cries"
19883,HYMNS,"At those fell fires of Phœbus’ prodigies,"
19884,HYMNS,That shaking fears through all their fancies threw.
19885,HYMNS,"Then, like the mind’s swift light, again he flew"
19886,HYMNS,"Back to the ship, shaped like a youth in height"
19887,HYMNS,"Of all his graces, shoulders broad and straight,"
19888,HYMNS,And all his hair in golden curls enwrapp’d;
19889,HYMNS,And to the merchants thus his speech he shap’d:
19890,HYMNS,“Ho! Strangers! What are you? And from what seat
19891,HYMNS,Sail ye these ways that salt and water sweat?
19892,HYMNS,To traffic justly? Or use vagrant scapes
19893,HYMNS,"Void of all rule, conferring wrongs and rapes,"
19894,HYMNS,"Like pirates, on the men ye never saw,"
19895,HYMNS,With minds project exempt from list or law?
19896,HYMNS,"Why sit ye here so stupefied, nor take"
19897,HYMNS,"Land while ye may, nor deposition make"
19898,HYMNS,"Of naval arms, when this the fashion is"
19899,HYMNS,"Of men industrious, who (their faculties"
19900,HYMNS,"Wearied at sea) leave ship, and use the land"
19901,HYMNS,"For food, that with their healths and stomachs stand?”"
19902,HYMNS,"This said, with bold minds he their breast supplied,"
19903,HYMNS,And thus made answer the Cretensian guide:
19904,HYMNS,“Stranger! Because you seem to us no seed
19905,HYMNS,"Of any mortal, but celestial breed"
19906,HYMNS,"For parts and person, joy your steps ensue,"
19907,HYMNS,And Gods make good the bliss we think your due.
19908,HYMNS,"Vouchsafe us true relation, on what land"
19909,HYMNS,"We here arrive, and what men here command."
19910,HYMNS,"We were for well-known parts bound, and from Crete"
19911,HYMNS,(Our vaunted country) to the Pylian seat
19912,HYMNS,"Vow’d our whole voyage; yet arrive we here,"
19913,HYMNS,"Quite cross to those wills that our motions steer,"
19914,HYMNS,"Wishing to make return some other way,"
19915,HYMNS,"Some other course desirous to assay,"
19916,HYMNS,To pay our lost pains. But some God hath fill’d
19917,HYMNS,"Our frustrate sails, defeating what we will’d.”"
19918,HYMNS,Apollo answer’d: “Strangers! Though before
19919,HYMNS,"Ye dwelt in woody Cnossus, yet no more"
19920,HYMNS,Ye must be made your own reciprocals
19921,HYMNS,To your loved city and fair severals
19922,HYMNS,"Of wives and houses, but ye shall have here"
19923,HYMNS,"My wealthy temple, honour’d far and near"
19924,HYMNS,Of many a nation; for myself am son
19925,HYMNS,"To Jove himself, and of Apollo won"
19926,HYMNS,"The glorious title, who thus safely through"
19927,HYMNS,"The sea’s vast billows still have held your plough,"
19928,HYMNS,"No ill intending, that will yet ye make"
19929,HYMNS,"My temple here your own, and honours take"
19930,HYMNS,"Upon yourselves, all that to me are given."
19931,HYMNS,"And more, the counsels of the King of Heaven"
19932,HYMNS,"Yourselves shall know, and with his will receive"
19933,HYMNS,Ever the honours that all men shall give.
19934,HYMNS,"Do as I say then instantly, strike sail,"
19935,HYMNS,"Take down your tackling, and your vessel hale"
19936,HYMNS,"Up into land; your goods bring forth, and all"
19937,HYMNS,The instruments that into sailing fall;
19938,HYMNS,"Make on this shore an altar, fire enflame,"
19939,HYMNS,And barley white cakes offer to my name;
19940,HYMNS,"And then, environing the altar, pray,"
19941,HYMNS,And call me (as ye saw me in the day
19942,HYMNS,When from the windy seas I brake swift way
19943,HYMNS,"Into your ship) Delphinius, since I took"
19944,HYMNS,A dolphin’s form then. And to every look
19945,HYMNS,"That there shall seek it, that my altar shall"
19946,HYMNS,Be made a Delphian memorial
19947,HYMNS,"From thence for ever. After this, ascend"
19948,HYMNS,"Your swift black ship and sup, and then intend"
19949,HYMNS,Ingenuous offerings to the equal Gods
19950,HYMNS,That in celestial seats make blest abodes.
19951,HYMNS,"When, having stay’d your healthful hunger’s sting,"
19952,HYMNS,"Come all with me, and Io-pæans sing"
19953,HYMNS,"All the way’s length, till you attain the state"
19954,HYMNS,Where I your opulent fane have consecrate.”
19955,HYMNS,"To this they gave him passing diligent ear,"
19956,HYMNS,And vow’d to his obedience all they were.
19957,HYMNS,"First, striking sail, their tacklings then they losed,"
19958,HYMNS,And (with their gables stoop’d) their mast imposed
19959,HYMNS,"Into the mast-room. Forth themselves then went,"
19960,HYMNS,And from the sea into the continent
19961,HYMNS,Drew up their ship; which far up from the sand
19962,HYMNS,They rais’d with ample rafters. Then in hand
19963,HYMNS,They took the altar; and inform’d it on
19964,HYMNS,"The sea’s near shore, imposing thereupon"
19965,HYMNS,"White cakes of barley, fire made, and did stand"
19966,HYMNS,"About it round, as Phœbus gave command,"
19967,HYMNS,Submitting invocations to his will.
19968,HYMNS,Then sacrific’d to all the heavenly hill
19969,HYMNS,Of pow’rful Godheads. After which they eat
19970,HYMNS,"Aboard their ship, till with fit food replete"
19971,HYMNS,"They rose, nor to their temple used delay."
19972,HYMNS,"Whom Phœbus usher’d, and touch’d all the way"
19973,HYMNS,"His heavenly lute with art above admired,"
19974,HYMNS,Gracefully leading them. When all were fired
19975,HYMNS,"With zeal to him, and follow’d wond’ring all"
19976,HYMNS,To Pythos; and upon his name did call
19977,HYMNS,"With Io-pæans, such as Cretans use."
19978,HYMNS,And in their bosoms did the deified Muse
19979,HYMNS,Voices of honey-harmony infuse.
19980,HYMNS,"With never-weary feet their way they went,"
19981,HYMNS,And made with all alacrity ascent
19982,HYMNS,"Up to Parnassus, and that long’d-for place"
19983,HYMNS,"Where they should live, and be of men the grace."
19984,HYMNS,"When, all the way, Apollo show’d them still"
19985,HYMNS,"Their far-stretch’d valleys, and their two-topp’d hill,"
19986,HYMNS,"Their famous fane, and all that all could raise"
19987,HYMNS,To a supreme height of their joy and praise.
19988,HYMNS,And then the Cretan captain thus inquired
19989,HYMNS,"Of King Apollo: “Since you have retired,"
19990,HYMNS,"O sovereign, our sad lives so far from friends"
19991,HYMNS,And native soil (because so far extends
19992,HYMNS,Your dear mind’s pleasure) tell us how we shall
19993,HYMNS,Live in your service? To which question call
19994,HYMNS,"Our provident minds, because we see not crown’d"
19995,HYMNS,"This soil with store of vines, nor doth abound"
19996,HYMNS,"In wealthy meadows, on which we may live,"
19997,HYMNS,As well as on men our attendance give.”
19998,HYMNS,"He smiled, and said: “O men that nothing know,"
19999,HYMNS,"And so are follow’d with a world of woe,"
20000,HYMNS,"That needs will succour care and curious moan,"
20001,HYMNS,"And pour out sighs without cessation,"
20002,HYMNS,Were all the riches of the earth your own!
20003,HYMNS,"Without much business, I will render known"
20004,HYMNS,To your simplicities an easy way
20005,HYMNS,"To wealth enough, Let every man purvey"
20006,HYMNS,"A skeane, or slaught’ring steel, and his right hand,"
20007,HYMNS,"Bravely bestowing, evermore see mann’d"
20008,HYMNS,"With killing sheep, that to my fane will flow"
20009,HYMNS,From all far nations. On all which bestow
20010,HYMNS,"Good observation, and all else they give"
20011,HYMNS,"To me make you your own all, and so live."
20012,HYMNS,"For all which watch before my temple well,"
20013,HYMNS,"And all my counsels, above all, conceal."
20014,HYMNS,"If any give vain language, or to deeds,"
20015,HYMNS,"Yea or as far as injury, proceeds,"
20016,HYMNS,"Know that, at losers’ hands, for those that gain,"
20017,HYMNS,It is the law of mortals to sustain.
20018,HYMNS,"Besides, ye shall have princes to obey,"
20019,HYMNS,"Which still ye must, and (so ye gain) ye may."
20020,HYMNS,All now is said; give all thy memory’s stay.”
20021,HYMNS,"And thus to thee, Jove and Latona’s son,"
20022,HYMNS,Be given all grace of salutation!
20023,HYMNS,Both thee and others of th’ Immortal State
20024,HYMNS,My song shall memorize to endless date.
