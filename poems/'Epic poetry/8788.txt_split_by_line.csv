46,CANTO XXXII,
47,CANTO XXXII,"COULD I command rough rhimes and hoarse, to suit"
48,CANTO XXXII,"That hole of sorrow, o'er which ev'ry rock"
49,CANTO XXXII,"His firm abutment rears, then might the vein"
50,CANTO XXXII,Of fancy rise full springing: but not mine
51,CANTO XXXII,"Such measures, and with falt'ring awe I touch"
52,CANTO XXXII,The mighty theme; for to describe the depth
53,CANTO XXXII,"Of all the universe, is no emprize"
54,CANTO XXXII,"To jest with, and demands a tongue not us'd"
55,CANTO XXXII,To infant babbling.  But let them assist
56,CANTO XXXII,"My song, the tuneful maidens, by whose aid"
57,CANTO XXXII,"Amphion wall'd in Thebes, so with the truth"
58,CANTO XXXII,"My speech shall best accord.  Oh ill-starr'd folk,"
59,CANTO XXXII,Beyond all others wretched! who abide
60,CANTO XXXII,"In such a mansion, as scarce thought finds words"
61,CANTO XXXII,"To speak of, better had ye here on earth"
62,CANTO XXXII,Been flocks or mountain goats.  As down we stood
63,CANTO XXXII,"In the dark pit beneath the giants' feet,"
64,CANTO XXXII,"But lower far than they, and I did gaze"
65,CANTO XXXII,"Still on the lofty battlement, a voice"
66,CANTO XXXII,"Bespoke me thus: ""Look how thou walkest.  Take"
67,CANTO XXXII,"Good heed, thy soles do tread not on the heads"
68,CANTO XXXII,"Of thy poor brethren.""  Thereupon I turn'd,"
69,CANTO XXXII,And saw before and underneath my feet
70,CANTO XXXII,"A lake, whose frozen surface liker seem'd"
71,CANTO XXXII,To glass than water.  Not so thick a veil
72,CANTO XXXII,In winter e'er hath Austrian Danube spread
73,CANTO XXXII,"O'er his still course, nor Tanais far remote"
74,CANTO XXXII,Under the chilling sky.  Roll'd o'er that mass
75,CANTO XXXII,"Had Tabernich or Pietrapana fall'n,"
76,CANTO XXXII,
77,CANTO XXXII,Not e'en its rim had creak'd. As peeps the frog
78,CANTO XXXII,"Croaking above the wave, what time in dreams"
79,CANTO XXXII,"The village gleaner oft pursues her toil,"
80,CANTO XXXII,"So, to where modest shame appears, thus low"
81,CANTO XXXII,"Blue pinch'd and shrin'd in ice the spirits stood,"
82,CANTO XXXII,Moving their teeth in shrill note like the stork.
83,CANTO XXXII,"His face each downward held; their mouth the cold,"
84,CANTO XXXII,Their eyes express'd the dolour of their heart.
85,CANTO XXXII,
86,CANTO XXXII,"A space I look'd around, then at my feet"
87,CANTO XXXII,"Saw two so strictly join'd, that of their head"
88,CANTO XXXII,"The very hairs were mingled.  ""Tell me ye,"
89,CANTO XXXII,"Whose bosoms thus together press,"" said I,"
90,CANTO XXXII,"""Who are ye?""  At that sound their necks they bent,"
91,CANTO XXXII,"And when their looks were lifted up to me,"
92,CANTO XXXII,"Straightway their eyes, before all moist within,"
93,CANTO XXXII,"Distill'd upon their lips, and the frost bound"
94,CANTO XXXII,The tears betwixt those orbs and held them there.
95,CANTO XXXII,Plank unto plank hath never cramp clos'd up
96,CANTO XXXII,So stoutly.  Whence like two enraged goats
97,CANTO XXXII,They clash'd together; them such fury seiz'd.
98,CANTO XXXII,
99,CANTO XXXII,"And one, from whom the cold both ears had reft,"
100,CANTO XXXII,"Exclaim'd, still looking downward: ""Why on us"
101,CANTO XXXII,Dost speculate so long?  If thou wouldst know
102,CANTO XXXII,"Who are these two, the valley, whence his wave"
103,CANTO XXXII,"Bisenzio slopes, did for its master own"
104,CANTO XXXII,"Their sire Alberto, and next him themselves."
105,CANTO XXXII,They from one body issued; and throughout
106,CANTO XXXII,"Caina thou mayst search, nor find a shade"
107,CANTO XXXII,"More worthy in congealment to be fix'd,"
108,CANTO XXXII,"Not him, whose breast and shadow Arthur's land"
109,CANTO XXXII,"At that one blow dissever'd, not Focaccia,"
110,CANTO XXXII,"No not this spirit, whose o'erjutting head"
111,CANTO XXXII,Obstructs my onward view: he bore the name
112,CANTO XXXII,"Of Mascheroni: Tuscan if thou be,"
113,CANTO XXXII,Well knowest who he was: and to cut short
114,CANTO XXXII,"All further question, in my form behold"
115,CANTO XXXII,What once was Camiccione.  I await
116,CANTO XXXII,"Carlino here my kinsman, whose deep guilt"
117,CANTO XXXII,"Shall wash out mine.""  A thousand visages"
118,CANTO XXXII,"Then mark'd I, which the keen and eager cold"
119,CANTO XXXII,Had shap'd into a doggish grin; whence creeps
120,CANTO XXXII,"A shiv'ring horror o'er me, at the thought"
121,CANTO XXXII,Of those frore shallows.  While we journey'd on
122,CANTO XXXII,"Toward the middle, at whose point unites"
123,CANTO XXXII,"All heavy substance, and I trembling went"
124,CANTO XXXII,"Through that eternal chillness, I know not"
125,CANTO XXXII,"If will it were or destiny, or chance,"
126,CANTO XXXII,"But, passing 'midst the heads, my foot did strike"
127,CANTO XXXII,With violent blow against the face of one.
128,CANTO XXXII,
129,CANTO XXXII,"""Wherefore dost bruise me?"" weeping, he exclaim'd,"
130,CANTO XXXII,"""Unless thy errand be some fresh revenge"
131,CANTO XXXII,"For Montaperto, wherefore troublest me?"""
132,CANTO XXXII,
133,CANTO XXXII,"I thus: ""Instructor, now await me here,"
134,CANTO XXXII,That I through him may rid me of my doubt.
135,CANTO XXXII,"Thenceforth what haste thou wilt.""  The teacher paus'd,"
136,CANTO XXXII,"And to that shade I spake, who bitterly"
137,CANTO XXXII,"Still curs'd me in his wrath.  ""What art thou, speak,"
138,CANTO XXXII,"That railest thus on others?""  He replied:"
139,CANTO XXXII,"""Now who art thou, that smiting others' cheeks"
140,CANTO XXXII,"Through Antenora roamest, with such force"
141,CANTO XXXII,"As were past suff'rance, wert thou living still?"""
142,CANTO XXXII,
143,CANTO XXXII,"""And I am living, to thy joy perchance,"""
144,CANTO XXXII,"Was my reply, ""if fame be dear to thee,"
145,CANTO XXXII,"That with the rest I may thy name enrol."""
146,CANTO XXXII,
147,CANTO XXXII,"""The contrary of what I covet most,"""
148,CANTO XXXII,"Said he, ""thou tender'st: hence; nor vex me more."
149,CANTO XXXII,"Ill knowest thou to flatter in this vale."""
150,CANTO XXXII,
151,CANTO XXXII,"Then seizing on his hinder scalp, I cried:"
152,CANTO XXXII,"""Name thee, or not a hair shall tarry here."""
153,CANTO XXXII,
154,CANTO XXXII,"""Rend all away,"" he answer'd, ""yet for that"
155,CANTO XXXII,"I will not tell nor show thee who I am,"
156,CANTO XXXII,"Though at my head thou pluck a thousand times."""
157,CANTO XXXII,
158,CANTO XXXII,"Now I had grasp'd his tresses, and stript off"
159,CANTO XXXII,"More than one tuft, he barking, with his eyes"
160,CANTO XXXII,"Drawn in and downward, when another cried,"
161,CANTO XXXII,"""What ails thee, Bocca?  Sound not loud enough"
162,CANTO XXXII,"Thy chatt'ring teeth, but thou must bark outright?"
163,CANTO XXXII,"What devil wrings thee?""--""Now,"" said I, ""be dumb,"
164,CANTO XXXII,Accursed traitor! to thy shame of thee
165,CANTO XXXII,"True tidings will I bear.""--""Off,"" he replied,"
166,CANTO XXXII,"""Tell what thou list; but as thou escape from hence"
167,CANTO XXXII,"To speak of him whose tongue hath been so glib,"
168,CANTO XXXII,Forget not: here he wails the Frenchman's gold.
169,CANTO XXXII,"'Him of Duera,' thou canst say, 'I mark'd,"
170,CANTO XXXII,Where the starv'd sinners pine.'  If thou be ask'd
171,CANTO XXXII,"What other shade was with them, at thy side"
172,CANTO XXXII,"Is Beccaria, whose red gorge distain'd"
173,CANTO XXXII,"The biting axe of Florence.  Farther on,"
174,CANTO XXXII,"If I misdeem not, Soldanieri bides,"
175,CANTO XXXII,"With Ganellon, and Tribaldello, him"
176,CANTO XXXII,"Who op'd Faenza when the people slept."""
177,CANTO XXXII,
178,CANTO XXXII,"We now had left him, passing on our way,"
179,CANTO XXXII,When I beheld two spirits by the ice
180,CANTO XXXII,"Pent in one hollow, that the head of one"
181,CANTO XXXII,Was cowl unto the other; and as bread
182,CANTO XXXII,"Is raven'd up through hunger, th' uppermost"
183,CANTO XXXII,"Did so apply his fangs to th' other's brain,"
184,CANTO XXXII,Where the spine joins it.  Not more furiously
185,CANTO XXXII,"On Menalippus' temples Tydeus gnaw'd,"
186,CANTO XXXII,Than on that skull and on its garbage he.
187,CANTO XXXII,
188,CANTO XXXII,"""O thou who show'st so beastly sign of hate"
189,CANTO XXXII,"'Gainst him thou prey'st on, let me hear,"" said I"
190,CANTO XXXII,"""The cause, on such condition, that if right"
191,CANTO XXXII,"Warrant thy grievance, knowing who ye are,"
192,CANTO XXXII,"And what the colour of his sinning was,"
193,CANTO XXXII,"I may repay thee in the world above,"
194,CANTO XXXII,"If that, wherewith I speak be moist so long."""
195,CANTO XXXII,
196,CANTO XXXII,
197,CANTO XXXII,
198,CANTO XXXII,
199,CANTO XXXIII,CANTO XXXIII
200,CANTO XXXIII,
201,CANTO XXXIII,"HIS jaws uplifting from their fell repast,"
202,CANTO XXXIII,"That sinner wip'd them on the hairs o' th' head,"
203,CANTO XXXIII,"Which he behind had mangled, then began:"
204,CANTO XXXIII,"""Thy will obeying, I call up afresh"
205,CANTO XXXIII,"Sorrow past cure, which but to think of wrings"
206,CANTO XXXIII,"My heart, or ere I tell on't. But if words,"
207,CANTO XXXIII,"That I may utter, shall prove seed to bear"
208,CANTO XXXIII,"Fruit of eternal infamy to him,"
209,CANTO XXXIII,"The traitor whom I gnaw at, thou at once"
210,CANTO XXXIII,Shalt see me speak and weep.  Who thou mayst be
211,CANTO XXXIII,"I know not, nor how here below art come:"
212,CANTO XXXIII,"But Florentine thou seemest of a truth,"
213,CANTO XXXIII,When I do hear thee.  Know I was on earth
214,CANTO XXXIII,"Count Ugolino, and th' Archbishop he"
215,CANTO XXXIII,"Ruggieri.  Why I neighbour him so close,"
216,CANTO XXXIII,Now list.  That through effect of his ill thoughts
217,CANTO XXXIII,"In him my trust reposing, I was ta'en"
218,CANTO XXXIII,"And after murder'd, need is not I tell."
219,CANTO XXXIII,"What therefore thou canst not have heard, that is,"
220,CANTO XXXIII,"How cruel was the murder, shalt thou hear,"
221,CANTO XXXIII,And know if he have wrong'd me.  A small grate
222,CANTO XXXIII,"Within that mew, which for my sake the name"
223,CANTO XXXIII,"Of famine bears, where others yet must pine,"
224,CANTO XXXIII,Already through its opening sev'ral moons
225,CANTO XXXIII,"Had shown me, when I slept the evil sleep,"
226,CANTO XXXIII,That from the future tore the curtain off.
227,CANTO XXXIII,"This one, methought, as master of the sport,"
228,CANTO XXXIII,Rode forth to chase the gaunt wolf and his whelps
229,CANTO XXXIII,"Unto the mountain, which forbids the sight"
230,CANTO XXXIII,Of Lucca to the Pisan.  With lean brachs
231,CANTO XXXIII,"Inquisitive and keen, before him rang'd"
232,CANTO XXXIII,Lanfranchi with Sismondi and Gualandi.
233,CANTO XXXIII,After short course the father and the sons
234,CANTO XXXIII,"Seem'd tir'd and lagging, and methought I saw"
235,CANTO XXXIII,The sharp tusks gore their sides.  When I awoke
236,CANTO XXXIII,"Before the dawn, amid their sleep I heard"
237,CANTO XXXIII,My sons (for they were with me) weep and ask
238,CANTO XXXIII,"For bread.  Right cruel art thou, if no pang"
239,CANTO XXXIII,Thou feel at thinking what my heart foretold;
240,CANTO XXXIII,"And if not now, why use thy tears to flow?"
241,CANTO XXXIII,Now had they waken'd; and the hour drew near
242,CANTO XXXIII,When they were wont to bring us food; the mind
243,CANTO XXXIII,"Of each misgave him through his dream, and I"
244,CANTO XXXIII,"Heard, at its outlet underneath lock'd up"
245,CANTO XXXIII,The' horrible tower: whence uttering not a word
246,CANTO XXXIII,I look'd upon the visage of my sons.
247,CANTO XXXIII,I wept not: so all stone I felt within.
248,CANTO XXXIII,"They wept: and one, my little Anslem, cried:"
249,CANTO XXXIII,"""Thou lookest so!  Father what ails thee?""  Yet"
250,CANTO XXXIII,"I shed no tear, nor answer'd all that day"
251,CANTO XXXIII,"Nor the next night, until another sun"
252,CANTO XXXIII,Came out upon the world.  When a faint beam
253,CANTO XXXIII,"Had to our doleful prison made its way,"
254,CANTO XXXIII,And in four countenances I descry'd
255,CANTO XXXIII,"The image of my own, on either hand"
256,CANTO XXXIII,"Through agony I bit, and they who thought"
257,CANTO XXXIII,"I did it through desire of feeding, rose"
258,CANTO XXXIII,"O' th' sudden, and cried, 'Father, we should grieve"
259,CANTO XXXIII,"Far less, if thou wouldst eat of us: thou gav'st"
260,CANTO XXXIII,"These weeds of miserable flesh we wear,"
261,CANTO XXXIII,
262,CANTO XXXIII,'And do thou strip them off from us again.'
263,CANTO XXXIII,"Then, not to make them sadder, I kept down"
264,CANTO XXXIII,My spirit in stillness.  That day and the next
265,CANTO XXXIII,"We all were silent.  Ah, obdurate earth!"
266,CANTO XXXIII,Why open'dst not upon us?  When we came
267,CANTO XXXIII,"To the fourth day, then Geddo at my feet"
268,CANTO XXXIII,"Outstretch'd did fling him, crying, 'Hast no help"
269,CANTO XXXIII,"For me, my father!'  There he died, and e'en"
270,CANTO XXXIII,"Plainly as thou seest me, saw I the three"
271,CANTO XXXIII,Fall one by one 'twixt the fifth day and sixth:
272,CANTO XXXIII,
273,CANTO XXXIII,"""Whence I betook me now grown blind to grope"
274,CANTO XXXIII,"Over them all, and for three days aloud"
275,CANTO XXXIII,Call'd on them who were dead.  Then fasting got
276,CANTO XXXIII,"The mastery of grief.""  Thus having spoke,"
277,CANTO XXXIII,
278,CANTO XXXIII,Once more upon the wretched skull his teeth
279,CANTO XXXIII,"He fasten'd, like a mastiff's 'gainst the bone"
280,CANTO XXXIII,Firm and unyielding.  Oh thou Pisa! shame
281,CANTO XXXIII,"Of all the people, who their dwelling make"
282,CANTO XXXIII,"In that fair region, where th' Italian voice"
283,CANTO XXXIII,"Is heard, since that thy neighbours are so slack"
284,CANTO XXXIII,"To punish, from their deep foundations rise"
285,CANTO XXXIII,"Capraia and Gorgona, and dam up"
286,CANTO XXXIII,"The mouth of Arno, that each soul in thee"
287,CANTO XXXIII,May perish in the waters!  What if fame
288,CANTO XXXIII,Reported that thy castles were betray'd
289,CANTO XXXIII,"By Ugolino, yet no right hadst thou"
290,CANTO XXXIII,"To stretch his children on the rack.  For them,"
291,CANTO XXXIII,"Brigata, Ugaccione, and the pair"
292,CANTO XXXIII,"Of gentle ones, of whom my song hath told,"
293,CANTO XXXIII,"Their tender years, thou modern Thebes! did make"
294,CANTO XXXIII,"Uncapable of guilt.  Onward we pass'd,"
295,CANTO XXXIII,Where others skarf'd in rugged folds of ice
296,CANTO XXXIII,"Not on their feet were turn'd, but each revers'd."
297,CANTO XXXIII,
298,CANTO XXXIII,There very weeping suffers not to weep;
299,CANTO XXXIII,For at their eyes grief seeking passage finds
300,CANTO XXXIII,"Impediment, and rolling inward turns"
301,CANTO XXXIII,For increase of sharp anguish: the first tears
302,CANTO XXXIII,"Hang cluster'd, and like crystal vizors show,"
303,CANTO XXXIII,Under the socket brimming all the cup.
304,CANTO XXXIII,
305,CANTO XXXIII,Now though the cold had from my face dislodg'd
306,CANTO XXXIII,"Each feeling, as 't were callous, yet me seem'd"
307,CANTO XXXIII,"Some breath of wind I felt.  ""Whence cometh this,"""
308,CANTO XXXIII,"Said I, ""my master?  Is not here below"
309,CANTO XXXIII,"All vapour quench'd?""--""'Thou shalt be speedily,"""
310,CANTO XXXIII,"He answer'd, ""where thine eye shall tell thee whence"
311,CANTO XXXIII,"The cause descrying of this airy shower."""
312,CANTO XXXIII,
313,CANTO XXXIII,Then cried out one in the chill crust who mourn'd:
314,CANTO XXXIII,"""O souls so cruel! that the farthest post"
315,CANTO XXXIII,"Hath been assign'd you, from this face remove"
316,CANTO XXXIII,"The harden'd veil, that I may vent the grief"
317,CANTO XXXIII,"Impregnate at my heart, some little space"
318,CANTO XXXIII,"Ere it congeal again!""  I thus replied:"
319,CANTO XXXIII,"""Say who thou wast, if thou wouldst have mine aid;"
320,CANTO XXXIII,"And if I extricate thee not, far down"
321,CANTO XXXIII,"As to the lowest ice may I descend!"""
322,CANTO XXXIII,
323,CANTO XXXIII,"""The friar Alberigo,"" answered he,"
324,CANTO XXXIII,"""Am I, who from the evil garden pluck'd"
325,CANTO XXXIII,"Its fruitage, and am here repaid, the date"
326,CANTO XXXIII,"More luscious for my fig.""--""Hah!""  I exclaim'd,"
327,CANTO XXXIII,"""Art thou too dead!""--""How in the world aloft"
328,CANTO XXXIII,"It fareth with my body,"" answer'd he,"
329,CANTO XXXIII,"""I am right ignorant.  Such privilege"
330,CANTO XXXIII,"Hath Ptolomea, that ofttimes the soul"
331,CANTO XXXIII,"Drops hither, ere by Atropos divorc'd."
332,CANTO XXXIII,And that thou mayst wipe out more willingly
333,CANTO XXXIII,"The glazed tear-drops that o'erlay mine eyes,"
334,CANTO XXXIII,"Know that the soul, that moment she betrays,"
335,CANTO XXXIII,"As I did, yields her body to a fiend"
336,CANTO XXXIII,"Who after moves and governs it at will,"
337,CANTO XXXIII,Till all its time be rounded; headlong she
338,CANTO XXXIII,Falls to this cistern.  And perchance above
339,CANTO XXXIII,"Doth yet appear the body of a ghost,"
340,CANTO XXXIII,"Who here behind me winters.  Him thou know'st,"
341,CANTO XXXIII,If thou but newly art arriv'd below.
342,CANTO XXXIII,"The years are many that have pass'd away,"
343,CANTO XXXIII,"Since to this fastness Branca Doria came."""
344,CANTO XXXIII,
345,CANTO XXXIII,"""Now,"" answer'd I, ""methinks thou mockest me,"
346,CANTO XXXIII,"For Branca Doria never yet hath died,"
347,CANTO XXXIII,"But doth all natural functions of a man,"
348,CANTO XXXIII,"Eats, drinks, and sleeps, and putteth raiment on."""
349,CANTO XXXIII,
350,CANTO XXXIII,"He thus: ""Not yet unto that upper foss"
351,CANTO XXXIII,"By th' evil talons guarded, where the pitch"
352,CANTO XXXIII,"Tenacious boils, had Michael Zanche reach'd,"
353,CANTO XXXIII,When this one left a demon in his stead
354,CANTO XXXIII,"In his own body, and of one his kin,"
355,CANTO XXXIII,Who with him treachery wrought.  But now put forth
356,CANTO XXXIII,"Thy hand, and ope mine eyes.""  I op'd them not."
357,CANTO XXXIII,Ill manners were best courtesy to him.
358,CANTO XXXIII,
359,CANTO XXXIII,"Ah Genoese! men perverse in every way,"
360,CANTO XXXIII,"With every foulness stain'd, why from the earth"
361,CANTO XXXIII,Are ye not cancel'd?  Such an one of yours
362,CANTO XXXIII,"I with Romagna's darkest spirit found,"
363,CANTO XXXIII,As for his doings even now in soul
364,CANTO XXXIII,"Is in Cocytus plung'd, and yet doth seem"
365,CANTO XXXIII,In body still alive upon the earth.
366,CANTO XXXIII,
367,CANTO XXXIII,
368,CANTO XXXIII,
369,CANTO XXXIII,
370,CANTO XXXIV,CANTO XXXIV
371,CANTO XXXIV,
372,CANTO XXXIV,"""THE banners of Hell's Monarch do come forth"
373,CANTO XXXIV,"Towards us; therefore look,"" so spake my guide,"
374,CANTO XXXIV,"""If thou discern him.""  As, when breathes a cloud"
375,CANTO XXXIV,"Heavy and dense, or when the shades of night"
376,CANTO XXXIV,"Fall on our hemisphere, seems view'd from far"
377,CANTO XXXIV,"A windmill, which the blast stirs briskly round,"
378,CANTO XXXIV,"Such was the fabric then methought I saw,"
379,CANTO XXXIV,
380,CANTO XXXIV,"To shield me from the wind, forthwith I drew"
381,CANTO XXXIV,Behind my guide: no covert else was there.
382,CANTO XXXIV,
383,CANTO XXXIV,Now came I (and with fear I bid my strain
384,CANTO XXXIV,Record the marvel) where the souls were all
385,CANTO XXXIV,"Whelm'd underneath, transparent, as through glass"
386,CANTO XXXIV,"Pellucid the frail stem.  Some prone were laid,"
387,CANTO XXXIV,"Others stood upright, this upon the soles,"
388,CANTO XXXIV,"That on his head, a third with face to feet"
389,CANTO XXXIV,"Arch'd like a bow.  When to the point we came,"
390,CANTO XXXIV,Whereat my guide was pleas'd that I should see
391,CANTO XXXIV,"The creature eminent in beauty once,"
392,CANTO XXXIV,He from before me stepp'd and made me pause.
393,CANTO XXXIV,
394,CANTO XXXIV,"""Lo!""  he exclaim'd, ""lo Dis! and lo the place,"
395,CANTO XXXIV,"Where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength."""
396,CANTO XXXIV,
397,CANTO XXXIV,"How frozen and how faint I then became,"
398,CANTO XXXIV,"Ask me not, reader! for I write it not,"
399,CANTO XXXIV,Since words would fail to tell thee of my state.
400,CANTO XXXIV,I was not dead nor living.  Think thyself
401,CANTO XXXIV,"If quick conception work in thee at all,"
402,CANTO XXXIV,"How I did feel.  That emperor, who sways"
403,CANTO XXXIV,"The realm of sorrow, at mid breast from th' ice"
404,CANTO XXXIV,Stood forth; and I in stature am more like
405,CANTO XXXIV,"A giant, than the giants are in his arms."
406,CANTO XXXIV,"Mark now how great that whole must be, which suits"
407,CANTO XXXIV,With such a part.  If he were beautiful
408,CANTO XXXIV,"As he is hideous now, and yet did dare"
409,CANTO XXXIV,"To scowl upon his Maker, well from him"
410,CANTO XXXIV,May all our mis'ry flow.  Oh what a sight!
411,CANTO XXXIV,"How passing strange it seem'd, when I did spy"
412,CANTO XXXIV,Upon his head three faces: one in front
413,CANTO XXXIV,"Of hue vermilion, th' other two with this"
414,CANTO XXXIV,Midway each shoulder join'd and at the crest;
415,CANTO XXXIV,The right 'twixt wan and yellow seem'd: the left
416,CANTO XXXIV,"To look on, such as come from whence old Nile"
417,CANTO XXXIV,Stoops to the lowlands.  Under each shot forth
418,CANTO XXXIV,"Two mighty wings, enormous as became"
419,CANTO XXXIV,A bird so vast.  Sails never such I saw
420,CANTO XXXIV,"Outstretch'd on the wide sea.  No plumes had they,"
421,CANTO XXXIV,"But were in texture like a bat, and these"
422,CANTO XXXIV,"He flapp'd i' th' air, that from him issued still"
423,CANTO XXXIV,"Three winds, wherewith Cocytus to its depth"
424,CANTO XXXIV,Was frozen.  At six eyes he wept: the tears
425,CANTO XXXIV,Adown three chins distill'd with bloody foam.
426,CANTO XXXIV,At every mouth his teeth a sinner champ'd
427,CANTO XXXIV,"Bruis'd as with pond'rous engine, so that three"
428,CANTO XXXIV,Were in this guise tormented.  But far more
429,CANTO XXXIV,"Than from that gnawing, was the foremost pang'd"
430,CANTO XXXIV,"By the fierce rending, whence ofttimes the back"
431,CANTO XXXIV,"Was stript of all its skin.  ""That upper spirit,"
432,CANTO XXXIV,"Who hath worse punishment,"" so spake my guide,"
433,CANTO XXXIV,"""Is Judas, he that hath his head within"
434,CANTO XXXIV,"And plies the feet without.  Of th' other two,"
435,CANTO XXXIV,"Whose heads are under, from the murky jaw"
436,CANTO XXXIV,"Who hangs, is Brutus: lo! how he doth writhe"
437,CANTO XXXIV,"And speaks not!  Th' other Cassius, that appears"
438,CANTO XXXIV,"So large of limb.  But night now re-ascends,"
439,CANTO XXXIV,"And it is time for parting.  All is seen."""
440,CANTO XXXIV,
441,CANTO XXXIV,"I clipp'd him round the neck, for so he bade;"
442,CANTO XXXIV,"And noting time and place, he, when the wings"
443,CANTO XXXIV,"Enough were op'd, caught fast the shaggy sides,"
444,CANTO XXXIV,And down from pile to pile descending stepp'd
445,CANTO XXXIV,Between the thick fell and the jagged ice.
446,CANTO XXXIV,
447,CANTO XXXIV,"Soon as he reach'd the point, whereat the thigh"
448,CANTO XXXIV,"Upon the swelling of the haunches turns,"
449,CANTO XXXIV,My leader there with pain and struggling hard
450,CANTO XXXIV,"Turn'd round his head, where his feet stood before,"
451,CANTO XXXIV,"And grappled at the fell, as one who mounts,"
452,CANTO XXXIV,That into hell methought we turn'd again.
453,CANTO XXXIV,
454,CANTO XXXIV,"""Expect that by such stairs as these,"" thus spake"
455,CANTO XXXIV,"The teacher, panting like a man forespent,"
456,CANTO XXXIV,"""We must depart from evil so extreme."""
457,CANTO XXXIV,"Then at a rocky opening issued forth,"
458,CANTO XXXIV,"And plac'd me on a brink to sit, next join'd"
459,CANTO XXXIV,"With wary step my side.  I rais'd mine eyes,"
460,CANTO XXXIV,Believing that I Lucifer should see
461,CANTO XXXIV,"Where he was lately left, but saw him now"
462,CANTO XXXIV,"With legs held upward.  Let the grosser sort,"
463,CANTO XXXIV,"Who see not what the point was I had pass'd,"
464,CANTO XXXIV,Bethink them if sore toil oppress'd me then.
465,CANTO XXXIV,
466,CANTO XXXIV,"""Arise,"" my master cried, ""upon thy feet."
467,CANTO XXXIV,"The way is long, and much uncouth the road;"
468,CANTO XXXIV,And now within one hour and half of noon
469,CANTO XXXIV,"The sun returns.""  It was no palace-hall"
470,CANTO XXXIV,"Lofty and luminous wherein we stood,"
471,CANTO XXXIV,But natural dungeon where ill footing was
472,CANTO XXXIV,"And scant supply of light.  ""Ere from th' abyss"
473,CANTO XXXIV,"I sep'rate,"" thus when risen I began,"
474,CANTO XXXIV,"""My guide! vouchsafe few words to set me free"
475,CANTO XXXIV,From error's thralldom.  Where is now the ice?
476,CANTO XXXIV,How standeth he in posture thus revers'd?
477,CANTO XXXIV,And how from eve to morn in space so brief
478,CANTO XXXIV,"Hath the sun made his transit?""  He in few"
479,CANTO XXXIV,"Thus answering spake: ""Thou deemest thou art still"
480,CANTO XXXIV,"On th' other side the centre, where I grasp'd"
481,CANTO XXXIV,"Th' abhorred worm, that boreth through the world."
482,CANTO XXXIV,"Thou wast on th' other side, so long as I"
483,CANTO XXXIV,"Descended; when I turn'd, thou didst o'erpass"
484,CANTO XXXIV,"That point, to which from ev'ry part is dragg'd"
485,CANTO XXXIV,All heavy substance.  Thou art now arriv'd
486,CANTO XXXIV,"Under the hemisphere opposed to that,"
487,CANTO XXXIV,"Which the great continent doth overspread,"
488,CANTO XXXIV,And underneath whose canopy expir'd
489,CANTO XXXIV,"The Man, that was born sinless, and so liv'd."
490,CANTO XXXIV,"Thy feet are planted on the smallest sphere,"
491,CANTO XXXIV,Whose other aspect is Judecca.  Morn
492,CANTO XXXIV,"Here rises, when there evening sets: and he,"
493,CANTO XXXIV,"Whose shaggy pile was scal'd, yet standeth fix'd,"
494,CANTO XXXIV,As at the first.  On this part he fell down
495,CANTO XXXIV,"From heav'n; and th' earth, here prominent before,"
496,CANTO XXXIV,"Through fear of him did veil her with the sea,"
497,CANTO XXXIV,And to our hemisphere retir'd.  Perchance
498,CANTO XXXIV,To shun him was the vacant space left here
499,CANTO XXXIV,"By what of firm land on this side appears,"
500,CANTO XXXIV,"That sprang aloof.""  There is a place beneath,"
501,CANTO XXXIV,"From Belzebub as distant, as extends"
502,CANTO XXXIV,"The vaulted tomb, discover'd not by sight,"
503,CANTO XXXIV,"But by the sound of brooklet, that descends"
504,CANTO XXXIV,"This way along the hollow of a rock,"
505,CANTO XXXIV,"Which, as it winds with no precipitous course,"
506,CANTO XXXIV,The wave hath eaten.  By that hidden way
507,CANTO XXXIV,"My guide and I did enter, to return"
508,CANTO XXXIV,To the fair world: and heedless of repose
509,CANTO XXXIV,"We climbed, he first, I following his steps,"
510,CANTO XXXIV,Till on our view the beautiful lights of heav'n
511,CANTO XXXIV,Dawn'd through a circular opening in the cave:
512,CANTO XXXIV,Thus issuing we again beheld the stars.
