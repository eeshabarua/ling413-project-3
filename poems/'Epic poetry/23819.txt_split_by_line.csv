55,PREFACE.,"Several years ago, the maker of this version translated into French one"
56,PREFACE.,of the early works of H. W. Longfellow. This circumstance was not
57,PREFACE.,forgotten by the American poet who kindly consented to listen to this
58,PREFACE.,"new attempt at rendering into English the ""CHANSON DE ROLAND."""
59,PREFACE.,
60,PREFACE.,To his encouragement is due the present publication. The writer will
61,PREFACE.,ever proudly treasure up the remembrance of his friendly welcome and
62,PREFACE.,counsel....

66,PREFACE.,"The translator has followed, as literally as possible, the text of the"
67,PREFACE.,"Oxford MS., as revised by Léon Gautier. The parts inclosed in"
68,PREFACE.,parentheses are interpolations of the learned Professor. This revised
69,PREFACE.,text should be kept in hand by the English reader for comparison with
70,PREFACE.,"the original, which is nine centuries old. The translator may thus be"
71,PREFACE.,more likely to obtain the indulgence of the reader for the quaint
72,PREFACE.,"representation, in a modern language, of the coloring of this most"
73,PREFACE.,ancient poem.
74,PREFACE.,
75,PREFACE.,"The orthography of all the names, as well as their prosodic accent, has"
76,PREFACE.,"been preserved in their ancient form; and accordingly, an index has been"
77,PREFACE.,appended to the work.
78,PREFACE.,
79,PREFACE.,"The seventh edition of Léon Gautier's ""CHANSON DE ROLAND,"" contains a"
80,PREFACE.,"vast amount of explanatory notes, grammatical and historical, to which"
81,PREFACE.,the reader is referred.

84,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,HISTORY OF THE POEM.
85,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,
86,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,"On the 15th of August, 778, in a little Pyrenean Valley, still known in"
87,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,"our days by the name of Ronceval, a terrible event took place."
88,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,"Charlemagne, returning from his expedition to Spain, crossed that valley"
89,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,"and the Pyrenees, leaving his rear-guard in command of Roland, Prefect"
90,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,of the Marches of Brittany. His main army had passed unmolested; but at
91,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,the moment when the rear-guard advanced into the defiles of the
92,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,"mountain, thousands of Gascons rushed from their ambush, fell upon the"
93,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,French army and slaughtered the whole guard to the last man. So perished
94,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,Roland.
95,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,
96,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,"Eginhard, the historian of Charlemagne, terminates his narrative with"
97,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,"these words: ""The House-intendant, (Regiæ mensæ præpositus), Eggihard,"
98,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,"Anselm, Count of the Palace, Roland, Prefect of the Marches of Brittany"
99,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,"(Hruolandus britannici limitis præfectus), with many more, perished in"
100,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,the fight. It was not possible to take revenge on the spot. The
101,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,"treacherous attempt once perpetrated, the enemy dispersed and left no"
102,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,"trace."" (Eginhard's Life of Charlemagne, Vol. I., p. 31; edition of the"
103,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,Société de l'histoire de France.)
104,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,
105,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,"From the moment of the defeat of Ronceval, legend commenced its labor"
106,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,"upon this truly epic event which, in its origin, is absolutely French,"
107,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,"but has found its echoes throughout Europe, from Iceland to Eastern"
108,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,regions.
109,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,
110,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,The commentators generally agree in dating the composition of the Poem
111,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,"before the first crusade in the year 1096. The author, it is"
112,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,"ascertained, was Norman, the dialect used by him being Norman"
113,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,"throughout. Whether this author was really Turoldus, named in the last"
114,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,"line of the Poem, is a point which Léon Gautier refuses to affirm. We"
115,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,"refer the reader to the very interesting preface of _Genin_, and to the"
116,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,"learned introductions of Léon Gautier, for more complete information."

120,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,"The word ""_Aoi_,"" which is placed at the end of every stanza, and found in"
121,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,"no other ancient French poems, is interpreted differently by the"
122,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,commentators. M. Francisque Michel assimilated it at first to the
123,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,"termination of an ecclesiastical chant--Preface, xxvii.--and later to"
124,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,"the Saxon _Abeg_, or the English _Away_, as a sort of refrain which the"
125,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,"""_jongleur_"" repeated at the end of the couplets. M. Génin explains it by"
126,HISTORY OF THE POEM.,"_ad viam_, a vei, avoie, away! it is done, let us go on!"

2192,CXIII.,"Ere this unknown to man. There, I will fight"
2193,CXIII.,"With my good Durendal; you, friend, will strike"

2202,CXIV.,When the French see the Pagan cohorts swarm
2203,CXIV.,"The country o'er, they call on Olivier,"
2204,CXIV.,Rollánd and the twelve Peers to guard their lives.
2205,CXIV.,Unto them now the Archbishop speaks his mind:
2206,CXIV.,"""Barons, be not unworthy of yourselves!"
2207,CXIV.,"Fly not the field, for God's sake, that brave men"
2208,CXIV.,Sing not ill songs of you! Far better die

2211,CXIV.,But for one thing ye can believe my word:

2225,CXV.,By pressing on his lip a kiss--Besides
2226,CXV.,Unto him gave his sword and carbuncle.
2227,CXV.,"""I will,"" said he, ""put your great France to shame"

2234,CXV.,Deep in the core the Pagan thrusts his spear
2235,CXV.,"So mightily, its point comes out behind,"
2236,CXV.,And with the shaft o'erturns him on the field

3454,CLXXX.,"Many have fallen swooning on the earth,"
3455,CLXXX.,But Duke Naimes bore himself as valorous knight:
3456,CLXXX.,"He foremost said to Carle:--""Behold two leagues"

3484,CLXXXI.,"The sun to stay, the shades of night hold back"
3485,CLXXXI.,And longer make the day. To him appears
3486,CLXXXI.,A Counselor-Angel with the swift command;
3487,CLXXXI.,"""Ride on, O King, nor fear that night shall fall!"
3488,CLXXXI.,God knows that thou hast lost the flower of France;

3503,CLXXXII.,"No issue, no escape, by road or pass!"

3555,CLXXXV.,Closed in the golden pommel of his sword.
3556,CLXXXV.,For this great glory and exceeding worth

3591,CLXXXVII.,And wond'rous tempests--smould'ring fire and flames
3592,CLXXXVII.,Ready to burst forth. Suddenly on all

3594,CLXXXVII.,Of apple-tree or ash--those shields ablaze
3595,CLXXXVII.,Unto their golden rings--shafts from their points

3638,CLXXXIX.,His right hand severed from the wrist whence blood
3639,CLXXXIX.,"Is gushing forth, has made him swoon with pain."
3640,CLXXXIX.,"Before Marsile, his spouse, Queen Bramimunde,"
3641,CLXXXIX.,"Bursts into tears, and cries, and woeful moans."
