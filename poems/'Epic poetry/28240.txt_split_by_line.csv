90,PREFACE,
91,PREFACE,THE present translation of _Pan Tadeusz_ is based on the editions of
92,PREFACE,"Biegeleisen (Lemberg, 1893) and Kallenbach (Brody, 1911). I have had"
93,PREFACE,"constantly by me the German translation by Lipiner (ed. 2, Leipzig, 1898)"
94,PREFACE,"and the French translation by Ostrowski (ed. 4, Paris, 1859), and am"
95,PREFACE,deeply indebted to them. The English translation by Miss Maude Ashurst
96,PREFACE,"Biggs (_Master Thaddeus; or, The Last Foray in Lithuania_: London, 1885) I"
97,PREFACE,did not have at hand until my own version was nearly complete; after that
98,PREFACE,I consulted it only very rarely. I do not think that I am under obligation
99,PREFACE,"to it in more than a half-dozen scattered lines of my text. (Perhaps,"
100,PREFACE,"however, my use of _foray_ as a translation of _zajazd_ is due to an"
101,PREFACE,"unconscious recollection of the title of Miss Biggs's volumes, which I"
102,PREFACE,"looked over several years ago, before I had even formed the plan of my own"
103,PREFACE,"work.) In my notes, however, my debt to Miss Biggs and her collaborators"
104,PREFACE,in her commentary on _Pan Tadeusz_ is important; I have striven to
105,PREFACE,"indicate it distinctly, and I thank Miss Biggs heartily for her kind"
106,PREFACE,permission to make use of her work.
107,PREFACE,
108,PREFACE,To my friend Miss Mary Helen Sznyter I am grateful for aid and advice in
109,PREFACE,the rendering of several puzzling passages. But my greatest debt I owe to
110,PREFACE,"my wife, whose name, if justice were done, should be added to my own as"
111,PREFACE,joint translator of the volume. Though she is entirely unacquainted with
112,PREFACE,"the Polish language, nearly every page of the book in its phrasing bears"
113,PREFACE,traces of her correcting hand. The preparation of the volume for the press
114,PREFACE,and the reading of the proof have been made easy by her skilful help.

125,INTRODUCTION,
126,INTRODUCTION,
127,INTRODUCTION,"""No European nation of our day has such an epic as _Pan Tadeusz_. In it"
128,INTRODUCTION,_Don Quixote_ has been fused with the _Iliad_. The poet stood on the
129,INTRODUCTION,"border line between a vanishing generation and our own. Before they died,"
130,INTRODUCTION,he had seen them; but now they are no more. That is precisely the epic
131,INTRODUCTION,point of view. Mickiewicz has performed his task with a master's hand; he
132,INTRODUCTION,"has made immortal a dead generation, which now will never pass away. {~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}"
133,INTRODUCTION,"_Pan Tadeusz_ is a true epic. No more can be said or need be said.""(1)"
134,INTRODUCTION,
135,INTRODUCTION,"This verdict upon the great masterpiece of all Slavic poetry, written a"
136,INTRODUCTION,"few years after its appearance, by Zygmunt Krasinski, one of Mickiewicz's"
137,INTRODUCTION,"two great successors in the field of Polish letters, has been confirmed by"
138,INTRODUCTION,the judgment of posterity. For the chapter on _Pan Tadeusz_ by George
139,INTRODUCTION,"Brandes, than whom there have been few more competent judges of modern"
140,INTRODUCTION,"European literature, is little more than an expansion of Krasinski's pithy"
141,INTRODUCTION,sentences. The cosmopolitan critic echoes the patriotic Pole when he
142,INTRODUCTION,"writes: ""In _Pan Tadeusz_ Poland possesses the only successful epic our"
143,INTRODUCTION,"century has produced.""(2)"
144,INTRODUCTION,
145,INTRODUCTION,Still more important than the praises of the finest literary critics is
146,INTRODUCTION,the enthusiastic affection cherished for _Pan Tadeasz_ by the great body
147,INTRODUCTION,of the Polish people. Perhaps no poem of any other European nation is so
148,INTRODUCTION,truly national and in the best sense of the word popular. Almost every
149,INTRODUCTION,Pole who has read anything more than the newspaper is familiar with the
150,INTRODUCTION,"contents of _Pan Tadeusz_. No play of Shakespeare, no long poem of Milton"
151,INTRODUCTION,"or Wordsworth or Tennyson, is so well known or so well beloved by the"
152,INTRODUCTION,English people as is _Pan Tadeusz_ by the Poles. To find a work equally
153,INTRODUCTION,"well known one might turn to Defoe's prosaic tale of adventure, _Robinson"
154,INTRODUCTION,Crusoe_; to find a work so beloved would be hardly possible.
155,INTRODUCTION,
156,INTRODUCTION,_Pan Tadeasz_ is so clear and straightforward in its appeal that but few
157,INTRODUCTION,"words of explanation in regard to its origin are required. Its author,"
158,INTRODUCTION,"Adam Mickiewicz, was born in 1798, near Nowogrodek in Lithuania. His"
159,INTRODUCTION,"father, a member of the poorer gentry of the district, was a lawyer by"
160,INTRODUCTION,"profession, so that the boy was brought up among just such types as he"
161,INTRODUCTION,"describes with so rare a humour in the Judge, the Assessor, the Notary,"
162,INTRODUCTION,and the Apparitor. The young Mickiewicz was sent to the University of
163,INTRODUCTION,"Wilno(3) (1815-19), where he received a good classical education, and,"
164,INTRODUCTION,"largely through his own independent reading, became well acquainted with"
165,INTRODUCTION,"French, German, and Russian--even with English literature. On leaving the"
166,INTRODUCTION,university he obtained a position as teacher in the gymnasium at Kowno
167,INTRODUCTION,"(1819-23). Though even as a boy he had written verses, his real literary"
168,INTRODUCTION,"career began with the publication in 1822 of a volume of ballads, which"
169,INTRODUCTION,"was followed the next year by a second book of poems, containing fragments"
170,INTRODUCTION,"of a fantastic drama, _The Forefathers_, and a short historical poem,"
171,INTRODUCTION,_Grazyna_. These volumes reflect the romantic movement then prevalent in
172,INTRODUCTION,"Europe, of which they are the first powerful expression in Poland. They"
173,INTRODUCTION,were in large part inspired by the poet's love for a young woman of
174,INTRODUCTION,"somewhat higher station than his own, who, though she returned his"
175,INTRODUCTION,"affection, was forced by her family to marry another suitor."
176,INTRODUCTION,
177,INTRODUCTION,"In 1833 Mickiewicz was arrested as a political criminal, his offence being"
178,INTRODUCTION,membership in a students' club at the University of Wilno that had
179,INTRODUCTION,"cherished nationalistic aspirations. With several others, he was banished"
180,INTRODUCTION,from his beloved Lithuanian home to the interior of Russia; the following
181,INTRODUCTION,"years, until 1829, he spent in St. Petersburg, Odessa, and Moscow. During"
182,INTRODUCTION,this honourable exile he became intimate with many of the most eminent men
183,INTRODUCTION,"of letters in Russia, and continued his own literary work by publishing"
184,INTRODUCTION,"his sonnets, beyond comparison the finest ever written in Polish, and a"
185,INTRODUCTION,"romantic poem, _Konrad Wallenrod_, based on the stubborn resistance of the"
186,INTRODUCTION,"Lithuanian folk in the fourteenth century to their German foes, the"
187,INTRODUCTION,"Knights of the Cross, and showing in its style marked Byronic influence."
188,INTRODUCTION,"The poem unfortunately admitted, or rather invited, an application to the"
189,INTRODUCTION,"resistance of the Poles to the Russians; Mickiewicz, fearing with reason"
190,INTRODUCTION,"the anger of the Russian authorities, succeeded in obtaining, just in time"
191,INTRODUCTION,"to save himself from serious consequences, a passport permitting him to"
192,INTRODUCTION,leave the country.
193,INTRODUCTION,
194,INTRODUCTION,"Arriving in Germany in 1829, Mickiewicz travelled through Switzerland to"
195,INTRODUCTION,"Italy. His residence in Rome, with its sacred associations, and the"
196,INTRODUCTION,"meeting with new friends of a deeply religious temperament, brought about"
197,INTRODUCTION,within him a new birth of Catholic faith that strongly affected bis later
198,INTRODUCTION,"writings, notably _Pan Tadeusz._ In Rome also he became intimate with the"
199,INTRODUCTION,"family of the rich Count Ankwicz, for whose daughter Eva he conceived an"
200,INTRODUCTION,affection that is reflected in the passion of Jacek Soplica for the
201,INTRODUCTION,"Pantler's only child. On the outbreak of the insurrection in Warsaw, at"
202,INTRODUCTION,"the end of the year 1830, the poet meditated returning home to join the"
203,INTRODUCTION,"national forces; but he delayed his departure, and never came nearer the"
204,INTRODUCTION,scene of action than Posen and its vicinity. The grief and discouragement
205,INTRODUCTION,"caused by the failure of the insurrection, instead of crippling"
206,INTRODUCTION,"Mickiewicz's powers, seemed to spur him on to new activity. During 1833 he"
207,INTRODUCTION,"wrote a continuation of _The Forefathers_, in an entirely different tone"
208,INTRODUCTION,from that of his youthful poem of ten years before. The action is based on
209,INTRODUCTION,the persecution by the Russian authorities of the Polish students in
210,INTRODUCTION,Wilno; the lovelorn Gustaw of the earlier poem is transformed into the
211,INTRODUCTION,"patriotic martyr Konrad. In this same year he settled in Paris, along with"
212,INTRODUCTION,"many other Polish exiles or ""emigrants,"" who were made homeless by the"
213,INTRODUCTION,"downfall of the national cause, and who, if the truth be said, were split"
214,INTRODUCTION,up into bitterly hostile factions. Mickiewicz was now beginning to assume
215,INTRODUCTION,the role of prophet and seer. For the reproof and instruction of his
216,INTRODUCTION,fellow-countrymen he composed his _Books of the Polish Nation and of the
217,INTRODUCTION,"Polish Pilgrimage,_ a mystical work, written in biblical prose, and"
218,INTRODUCTION,intended to bring comfort and harmony to the distracted exiles. In Paris
219,INTRODUCTION,"also, in the course of about fourteen months (1832-34), he wrote _Pan"
220,INTRODUCTION,"Tadeusz,_ his greatest poem--and (with insignificant exceptions) his last."
221,INTRODUCTION,
222,INTRODUCTION,The story of Mickiewicz's closing years may be passed over very briefly.
223,INTRODUCTION,"In 1834 he married; his wife was subject to attacks of insanity, and all"
224,INTRODUCTION,his later life was saddened by the struggle with misfortune and poverty.
225,INTRODUCTION,In 1840 he was called to a newly founded professorship of Slavic
226,INTRODUCTION,literature at the Collège de France. His lectures as holder of this chair
227,INTRODUCTION,are the only literary work of great importance that he produced during
228,INTRODUCTION,this last period of his life. Soon after the completion of _Pan Tadeusz_
229,INTRODUCTION,he had become absorbed by a religious mysticism that caused him to turn
230,INTRODUCTION,entirely aside from poetry. In 1841 he fell under the influence of Andrzej
231,INTRODUCTION,"Towianski, a teacher who announced himself as the prophet of a new"
232,INTRODUCTION,religion. His acceptance and promulgation of a doctrine which was
233,INTRODUCTION,"pronounced heretical by the Catholic Church, and which inculcated a"
234,INTRODUCTION,"religious reverence for Napoleonic traditions, made it impossible for the"
235,INTRODUCTION,"French government to retain his services in a government institution, and"
236,INTRODUCTION,in 1844 he was deprived of his professorship. The accession to power of
237,INTRODUCTION,Napoleon III. filled him with new hopes. In 1855 he journeyed to
238,INTRODUCTION,"Constantinople, wishing to aid in the war against Russia, and there he"
239,INTRODUCTION,"died of the cholera. His remains, first laid to rest in Paris, were"
240,INTRODUCTION,transferred in 1890 to the cathedral at Cracow.(4)
241,INTRODUCTION,
242,INTRODUCTION,"_Pan Tadeusz_ was not the result of a momentary inspiration, but grew"
243,INTRODUCTION,"gradually under the author's hand. On December 8, 1832, he wrote to a"
244,INTRODUCTION,"friend: ""I am now at work on a poem of life among the gentry, in the style"
245,INTRODUCTION,"of _Hermann and Dorothea_. I have already jotted down a thousand verses."""
246,INTRODUCTION,"He had evidently planned a village idyl of no great length, probably based"
247,INTRODUCTION,on the love of Thaddeus and Zosia. In a draft of the first book that is
248,INTRODUCTION,"still preserved, Thaddeus sees on the wall a picture of Joseph Poniatowski"
249,INTRODUCTION,"at the battle of Leipzig (October 19, 1813), ""riding a mettled steed"" but"
250,INTRODUCTION,"""stricken with a mortal wound."" Thus the action of the poem could not have"
251,INTRODUCTION,"taken place earlier than 1814. Later, Mickiewicz threw back the time of"
252,INTRODUCTION,"his action to the autumn of 1811 and the spring of 1812; thus, by giving"
253,INTRODUCTION,"his poem a political background in the invasion of Russia by Napoleon, he"
254,INTRODUCTION,"transformed his village idyl into a national epic. The Monk Robak, or"
255,INTRODUCTION,"Jacek Soplica, and not his commonplace son Thaddeus, now became the real"
256,INTRODUCTION,hero of the poem.(5) Nor was this hero wholly a product of the writer's
257,INTRODUCTION,invention. There has recently been discovered a petition by Mikolaj
258,INTRODUCTION,"Mickiewicz, the father of the poet, praying the authorities to grant him"
259,INTRODUCTION,"protection from one Jan Soplica, ""a man of criminal sort,"" who had slain"
260,INTRODUCTION,the uncle of the petitioner and was now threatening to kill the whole
261,INTRODUCTION,Mickiewicz family and burn their house. With the character of this person
262,INTRODUCTION,the description of Jacek Soplica's early years agrees as closely as his
263,INTRODUCTION,name. Mickiewicz even mentions his own kindred as the ancestral enemies of
264,INTRODUCTION,the Soplicas (page 45). Yet one of that hated family he now made the hero
265,INTRODUCTION,"of his greatest poem. By introducing him in the guise of Father Robak,"
266,INTRODUCTION,repentant and striving to atone for past misdeeds through heroic service
267,INTRODUCTION,"to his country, he infused into his poem a romantic charm. The mystery"
268,INTRODUCTION,"surrounding this figure connects _Pan Tadeusz_, an epic that is truly"
269,INTRODUCTION,"classic in its dignified elevation and restraint of feeling, with _Konrad"
270,INTRODUCTION,"Wallenrod_, a romantic tale conceived in the spirit of Byronic passion."
271,INTRODUCTION,
272,INTRODUCTION,In the work of Mickiewicz as a whole two characteristics predominate: a
273,INTRODUCTION,"great intensity of feeling, which sometimes sinks into sentimentality, and"
274,INTRODUCTION,"at others rises into lyric fervour; and a wonderful truth, not only to the"
275,INTRODUCTION,"general impressions of his experience, but to the actual concrete facts of"
276,INTRODUCTION,"it, even to such trifles as the names of persons and places. Thus _The"
277,INTRODUCTION,"Forefathers,_ despite all its fantastic elements, reproduces many"
278,INTRODUCTION,"incidents in which the poet himself was concerned. Furthermore, in certain"
279,INTRODUCTION,"works, as in his early tale _Grazyna_, Mickiewicz had shown a wonderful"
280,INTRODUCTION,ability suddenly to detach himself from passing currents of emotion and to
281,INTRODUCTION,"rise into regions of Olympian calm, giving to his work a classic, rounded"
282,INTRODUCTION,completeness worthy of Grecian art. All these aspects of his genius are
283,INTRODUCTION,present in _Pan Tadeusz_. Echoes of the poet's personal emotion are heard
284,INTRODUCTION,in Jacek's tale of his passion for Eva; and an ardent love of country
285,INTRODUCTION,permeates the poem and breaks out again and again with lyric force. On the
286,INTRODUCTION,other hand the book is faithful to reality in its picture of Lithuanian
287,INTRODUCTION,manners and customs; the great romantic poet is at the same time the first
288,INTRODUCTION,realistic novelist of Poland. Minor details beyond number are introduced
289,INTRODUCTION,"from the writer's personal recollections; ""even the Jew's playing of the"
290,INTRODUCTION,dulcimer the poet had heard in St. Petersburg from the famous
291,INTRODUCTION,"Silbermann.""(6) Through the whole book runs a humour not often found"
292,INTRODUCTION,elsewhere in Mickiewicz; the reports of the debates in Jankiel's tavern
293,INTRODUCTION,and in Dobrzyn hamlet are masterly in their blending of kindly pleasantry
294,INTRODUCTION,with photographic fidelity to truth. The poet sees the ludicrous side of
295,INTRODUCTION,"the Warden, the Chamberlain, the Seneschal, and the other Don Quixotes who"
296,INTRODUCTION,"fill his pages, and yet he loves them with the most tender affection. In"
297,INTRODUCTION,his descriptions of external nature--of the Lithuanian forests or of the
298,INTRODUCTION,scene around Soplicowo on the moonlight night just before the
299,INTRODUCTION,foray--Mickiewicz shows a genius for throwing a glamour of poetic beauty
300,INTRODUCTION,"over the face of common things such as has never been surpassed. Finally,"
301,INTRODUCTION,"the whole poem is perfect in its proportions; from its homely beginning,"
302,INTRODUCTION,"with pictures of rural simplicity and old-fashioned hospitality, it swells"
303,INTRODUCTION,"into rustic grandeur in the panorama of the hunt, and at last reaches the"
304,INTRODUCTION,most poignant tragedy in the scene about the death-bed of Jacek Soplica:
305,INTRODUCTION,"then, lest the impression should be one of total sadness, the narrative"
306,INTRODUCTION,"concludes with the magnificent epilogue of the last two books, full of"
307,INTRODUCTION,"hopes of rescue for Poland, full of gaiety and courage. A large epic calm"
308,INTRODUCTION,"pervades the whole. The age-long conflict between Pole and ""Muscovite"" is"
309,INTRODUCTION,"the theme of the epic, but the tone is not that of passionate hatred and"
310,INTRODUCTION,revolt such as fills _The Forefathers_; human kindliness breathes through
311,INTRODUCTION,"the whole work; not indignation and rebellion, but faith, hope, and love"
312,INTRODUCTION,are at its foundation.
313,INTRODUCTION,
314,INTRODUCTION,This brief introduction may fitly close with some verses that Mickiewicz
315,INTRODUCTION,"wrote as an epilogue for _Pan Tadeusz_, but which he never finally revised"
316,INTRODUCTION,and which were never printed during his lifetime. Since his death they
317,INTRODUCTION,have most frequently been inserted as a prologue to the poem rather than
318,INTRODUCTION,as an epilogue.

494,PRONUNCIATION,"Hreczecha, the Seneschal [Hre-che'hä]."
495,PRONUNCIATION,The Chamberlain.

501,PRONUNCIATION,"Gerwazy Rembajlo, the Warden, formerly a servant"
502,PRONUNCIATION,of the Horeszko family [Ger-vä'zi Rem-bai'wo].
503,PRONUNCIATION,"Rykov, a Russian captain [Ri'kof]."

511,PRONUNCIATION,Otton-Karol Kniaziewicz [Ot'ton-Kä'rol Knyä-zhe'vich].
512,PRONUNCIATION,
513,PRONUNCIATION,The following names are frequently mentioned in the poem: Kosciuszko
514,PRONUNCIATION,"[Ko-shchoosh'ko], Rejtan [Rä'tän], Mickiewicz [Mits-kye'vich]. Note also"
515,PRONUNCIATION,the words _wojewoda_ [vo-ye-vo'da] and _kontusz_ [kon'toosh].
516,PRONUNCIATION,
517,PRONUNCIATION,"Polish names in this book are generally given in their original spelling,"
518,PRONUNCIATION,except that the diacritical marks used on many letters in the Polish
519,PRONUNCIATION,"alphabet are here omitted, and that _on_ (or _om_) and _en_ (or _em_) are"
520,PRONUNCIATION,substituted for the nasal vowels indicated in Polish by _a_ with a cedilla
521,PRONUNCIATION,"and _e_ with a cedilla. But the English names _Thaddeus, Sophia, Eva,"
522,PRONUNCIATION,"Rosa, Thomas_, and _Joseph_ have been substituted for the Polish forms"
523,PRONUNCIATION,"_Tadeusz, Zofia, Ewa, Roza, Tomasz,_ and _Jozef_. (Yet the Polish title of"
524,PRONUNCIATION,"the poem, _Pan Tadeusz,_ has been left unchanged, as it has become widely"
525,PRONUNCIATION,"known through works on Poland, and as a suitable substitute for it is hard"
526,PRONUNCIATION,to find: _Pan Thaddeus_ would be a displeasing hybrid.) The few Russian
527,PRONUNCIATION,"names that occur are given as though transliterated from the Russian, not"
528,PRONUNCIATION,"in the Polish form: _Suvorov_, not _Suwarow_."
529,PRONUNCIATION,
530,PRONUNCIATION,"The Polish _Pan, Pani_, and _Panna_ correspond roughly to the English"
531,PRONUNCIATION,"_Mr., Mrs._, and _Miss_. But _Pani_ may be used of unmarried women of high"
532,PRONUNCIATION,"social station; it is regularly applied to Telimena, and once, by the"
533,PRONUNCIATION,"reverent Gerwazy, even to little Zosia (page 320)."
534,PRONUNCIATION,
535,PRONUNCIATION,As an aid to the pronunciation of the minor names the following directions
536,PRONUNCIATION,may be of some service:--
537,PRONUNCIATION,
538,PRONUNCIATION,"Accent all names on the penult, or next to the last syllable."
539,PRONUNCIATION,
540,PRONUNCIATION,"Pronounce _cz_ as _ch, sz_ as _sh, rz_ as _zh_ (azure), _j_ as _y_ (_aj,"
541,PRONUNCIATION,"ej, oj_ as _i, a, oi_). _W_ is ordinarily pronounced as _v_, but before"
542,PRONUNCIATION,"surd consonants it has the sound _f_. _Ch_ is pronounced as in German, but"
543,PRONUNCIATION,before vowels it need not be distinguished from the English _h_. The
544,PRONUNCIATION,"Polish _l_ has two values, one of which resembles the English _l_, while"
545,PRONUNCIATION,the other (the crossed _l_) approximates to the English _w_. _S_ is
546,PRONUNCIATION,"ordinarily pronounced as in English, but before _i_ it has a sound"
547,PRONUNCIATION,somewhat like _sh_; _si_ before a vowel (as in _Zosia_) has the same
548,PRONUNCIATION,"sound, the _i_ not being pronounced, but serving as an indication of the"
549,PRONUNCIATION,"""soft"" pronunciation of the preceding sibilant. In the same circumstances"
550,PRONUNCIATION,_z_ (and _zi_) are pronounced somewhat like _zh_. The Polish alphabet also
551,PRONUNCIATION,contains a dotted _z_ (here represented by plain _z_) which is pronounced
552,PRONUNCIATION,like _zh_. _Dz_ before _i_ (and _dzi_ before a vowel) are pronounced
553,PRONUNCIATION,somewhat like English _j_ in _jet_. _C_ is ordinarily pronounced like
554,PRONUNCIATION,"_ts_, but _c_ before _i_ (and _ci_ before a vowel) are sounded somewhat"
555,PRONUNCIATION,like _ch_.
556,PRONUNCIATION,
557,PRONUNCIATION,"The vowels may be given the familiar ""Italian"" values; _y_ need not be"
558,PRONUNCIATION,"distinguished from _i_. (But on _i_ as a diacritical sign, modifying a"
559,PRONUNCIATION,"preceding sibilant, see the preceding paragraph.) Furthermore, _i_"
560,PRONUNCIATION,"following a consonant (not a sibilant) and preceding a vowel, is"
561,PRONUNCIATION,"pronounced like _y_, as in _Jankiel_ (Yän'kyel)."
562,PRONUNCIATION,
563,PRONUNCIATION,"These rules, it must be said, are incomplete and inexact to a degree that"
564,PRONUNCIATION,will shock any person with a scientific knowledge of Polish pronunciation.
565,PRONUNCIATION,In the present instance brevity seemed of more importance than strict
566,PRONUNCIATION,accuracy.

600,ARGUMENT,Ostra Gate in Wilno!2 Thou who dost shelter the castle of Nowogrodek with
601,ARGUMENT,its faithful folk! As by miracle thou didst restore me to health in my
602,ARGUMENT,"childhood--when, offered by my weeping mother to thy protection, I raised"
603,ARGUMENT,"my dead eyelids, and could straightway walk to the threshold of thy shrine"
604,ARGUMENT,to thank God for the life returned me--so by miracle thou wilt return us to
605,ARGUMENT,the bosom of our country. Meanwhile bear my grief-stricken soul to those
606,ARGUMENT,"wooded hills, to those green meadows stretched far and wide along the blue"
607,ARGUMENT,"Niemen; to those fields painted with various grain, gilded with wheat,"
608,ARGUMENT,"silvered with rye; where grows the amber mustard, the buckwheat white as"
609,ARGUMENT,"snow, where the clover glows with a maiden's blush, where all is girdled"
610,ARGUMENT,as with a ribbon by a strip of green turf on which here and there rest
611,ARGUMENT,quiet pear-trees.
612,ARGUMENT,
613,ARGUMENT,"Amid such fields years ago, by the border of a brook, on a low hill, in a"
614,ARGUMENT,"grove of birches, stood a gentleman's3 mansion, of wood, but with a stone"
615,ARGUMENT,"foundation; the white walls shone from afar, the whiter since they were"
616,ARGUMENT,relieved against the dark green of the poplars that sheltered it against
617,ARGUMENT,"the winds of autumn. The dwelling-house was not large, but it was"
618,ARGUMENT,"spotlessly neat, and it had a mighty barn, and near it were three stacks"
619,ARGUMENT,of hay that could not be contained beneath the roof; one could see that
620,ARGUMENT,the neighbourhood was rich and fertile. And one could see from the number
621,ARGUMENT,of sheaves that up and down the meadows shone thick as stars--one could see
622,ARGUMENT,from the number of ploughs turning up early the immense tracts of black
623,ARGUMENT,"fallow land that evidently belonged to the mansion, and were tilled well"
624,ARGUMENT,"like garden beds, that in that house dwelt plenty and order. The gate"
625,ARGUMENT,"wide-open proclaimed to passers-by that it was hospitable, and invited all"
626,ARGUMENT,to enter as guests.
627,ARGUMENT,
628,ARGUMENT,"A young gentleman had just entered in a two-horse carriage, and, after"
629,ARGUMENT,"making a turn about the yard, he stopped before the porch and descended;"
630,ARGUMENT,"his horses, left to themselves, slowly moved towards the gate, nibbling"
631,ARGUMENT,"the grass. The mansion was deserted, for the porch doors were barred and"
632,ARGUMENT,the bar fastened with a pin. The traveller did not run to make inquiries
633,ARGUMENT,"at the farmhouse but opened the door and ran into the mansion, for he was"
634,ARGUMENT,"eager to greet it. It was long since he had seen the house, for he had"
635,ARGUMENT,been studying in a distant city and had at last finished his course. He
636,ARGUMENT,"ran in and gazed with eager emotion upon the ancient walls, his old"
637,ARGUMENT,"friends. He sees the same furniture, the same hangings with which he had"
638,ARGUMENT,"loved to amuse himself from babyhood, but they seemed less beautiful and"
639,ARGUMENT,not so large as of old. And the same portraits hung upon the walls. Here
640,ARGUMENT,"Kosciuszko,4 in his Cracow coat,5 with his eyes raised to heaven, held his"
641,ARGUMENT,two-handed sword; such was he when on the steps of the altar he swore that
642,ARGUMENT,with this sword he would drive the three powers from Poland or himself
643,ARGUMENT,"would fall upon it. Farther on sat Rejtan,6 in Polish costume, mourning"
644,ARGUMENT,the loss of liberty; in his hands he held a knife with the point turned
645,ARGUMENT,"against his breast, and before him lay _Phaedo_ and _The Life of Cato_."
646,ARGUMENT,"Still farther on Jasinski,7 a fair and melancholy youth, and his faithful"
647,ARGUMENT,"comrade Korsak8 stand side by side on the entrenchments of Praga, on heaps"
648,ARGUMENT,"of Muscovites, hewing down the enemies of their country--but around them"
649,ARGUMENT,Praga is already burning.
650,ARGUMENT,
651,ARGUMENT,He recognised even the tall old musical clock in its wooden case near the
652,ARGUMENT,"chamber door, and with childish joy he pulled at the string, in order to"
653,ARGUMENT,hear Dombrowski's old mazurka.71
654,ARGUMENT,
655,ARGUMENT,He ran about the whole house and searched for the room that had been his
656,ARGUMENT,"own when he was a child, ten years before. He entered, drew back, and"
657,ARGUMENT,surveyed the walls with astonished eyes: could this room be a woman's
658,ARGUMENT,"lodgings? Who could live here? His old uncle was unmarried, and his aunt"
659,ARGUMENT,had dwelt for years in St. Petersburg. Could that be the housekeeper's
660,ARGUMENT,chamber? A piano? On it music and books; all abandoned in careless
661,ARGUMENT,confusion: sweet disorder!
662,ARGUMENT,
663,ARGUMENT,"Not old could the hands have been that had so abandoned them! There too, a"
664,ARGUMENT,"white gown, freshly taken from the hook to put on, was spread upon the arm"
665,ARGUMENT,"of a chair. In the windows were pots of fragrant flowers: geraniums,"
666,ARGUMENT,"asters, gillyflowers, and violets. The traveller stepped to one of the"
667,ARGUMENT,"windows--a new marvel was before him. On the bank of the brook, in a spot"
668,ARGUMENT,"once overgrown with nettles, was a tiny garden intersected by paths, full"
669,ARGUMENT,"of clumps of English grass and of mint. The slender wooden fence,"
670,ARGUMENT,"fashioned into a monogram, shone with ribbons of gay daisies. Evidently"
671,ARGUMENT,the beds had but just been sprinkled; there stood the tin watering-pot
672,ARGUMENT,"full of water, but the fair gardener could nowhere be seen. She had only"
673,ARGUMENT,"now departed; the little gate, freshly touched, was still trembling; near"
674,ARGUMENT,the gate could be seen on the sand the print of a small foot that had been
675,ARGUMENT,"without shoe or stocking--on the fine dry sand, white as snow; the print"
676,ARGUMENT,was clear but light; you guessed that it was left in quick running by the
677,ARGUMENT,tiny feet of some one who scarce touched the ground.
678,ARGUMENT,
679,ARGUMENT,"The traveller stood long in the window gazing and musing, breathing in the"
680,ARGUMENT,fragrance of the flowers. He bent down his face to the violet plants; he
681,ARGUMENT,followed the paths with his curious eyes and again gazed on the tiny
682,ARGUMENT,footprints; he kept thinking of them and trying to guess whose they were.
683,ARGUMENT,"By chance he raised his eyes, and there on the wall stood a young girl--her"
684,ARGUMENT,"white garment hid her slender form only to the breast, leaving bare her"
685,ARGUMENT,shoulders and her swan's neck. Such attire a Lithuanian maiden is wont to
686,ARGUMENT,"wear only early in the day; in such she is never seen by men. So, though"
687,ARGUMENT,"there was no witness near, she had folded her arms on her breast, in order"
688,ARGUMENT,"to add a veil to her low garment. Her hair, not spread out in loose"
689,ARGUMENT,ringlets but twisted in little knots and wrapped in small white
690,ARGUMENT,"curl-papers, marvellously adorned her head, for in the sunlight it shone"
691,ARGUMENT,"like a crown on the image of a saint. Her face could not be seen, for she"
692,ARGUMENT,"had turned towards the meadow, and with her eyes was seeking some one far"
693,ARGUMENT,"off, below her. She caught sight of him, laughed, and clapped her hands;"
694,ARGUMENT,"like a white bird she flew from the wall to the turf, and flashed through"
695,ARGUMENT,"the garden, over stiles and flowers, and over a board supported on the"
696,ARGUMENT,"wall of the chamber; before the young man was aware, she had flown in"
697,ARGUMENT,"through the window, glittering, swift, and light as a moonbeam. Humming to"
698,ARGUMENT,"herself, she seized the gown and ran to the mirror; suddenly she saw the"
699,ARGUMENT,"youth, and the gown fell from her hands and her face grew pale with fright"
700,ARGUMENT,"and wonder. The face of the traveller flamed with a rosy blush, as a cloud"
701,ARGUMENT,when it is touched with the morning glow; the modest youth half closed his
702,ARGUMENT,"eyes and hid them with his hand; he wished to speak and ask for pardon,"
703,ARGUMENT,"but only bowed and stepped back. The maiden uttered a pitiful, indistinct"
704,ARGUMENT,"cry, like a child frightened in its sleep; the traveller looked up in"
705,ARGUMENT,"alarm, but she was there no longer; he departed in confusion and felt the"
706,ARGUMENT,loud beating of his heart; he knew not whether this strange meeting should
707,ARGUMENT,cause him amusement or shame or joy.
708,ARGUMENT,
709,ARGUMENT,Meanwhile in the farmhouse they had not failed to notice that some new
710,ARGUMENT,guest had driven up before the porch. They had already taken the horses to
711,ARGUMENT,"the stable and already, as befits an honourable house, had given them"
712,ARGUMENT,"generously of oats and hay, for the Judge9 was never willing to adopt the"
713,ARGUMENT,new fashion of sending a guest's horse to a Jew's inn. The servants had
714,ARGUMENT,"not come out to welcome the traveller, but do not think that in the"
715,ARGUMENT,Judge's mansion service was careless; the servants were waiting until the
716,ARGUMENT,"Seneschal10 should attire him, who now behind the mansion was arranging"
717,ARGUMENT,"for the supper. He took the place of the master, and in his absence was"
718,ARGUMENT,"wont himself to welcome and entertain guests, being a distant relative of"
719,ARGUMENT,"the master and a friend of the house. Seeing the guest, he stealthily made"
720,ARGUMENT,"his way to the farmhouse, for he could not come out to greet the stranger"
721,ARGUMENT,in a homespun dressing-gown; there he put on as quickly as he might his
722,ARGUMENT,"Sunday garment, made ready since early morning, for since morning he had"
723,ARGUMENT,known that at supper he should sit with a multitude of guests.
724,ARGUMENT,
725,ARGUMENT,"The Seneschal recognised the traveller from afar, spread out his arms, and"
726,ARGUMENT,"with a cry embraced and kissed him. Then began a hurried, confused"
727,ARGUMENT,"discourse, in which they were eager to tell the events of many years in a"
728,ARGUMENT,"few brief words, mingled, as the tale went forward, with queries,"
729,ARGUMENT,"exclamations, and new greetings. When the Seneschal had asked his fill of"
730,ARGUMENT,"questions, at the very last he told the story of that day."
731,ARGUMENT,
732,ARGUMENT,"""It is good, my Thaddeus,""--for so they called the young man, whose first"
733,ARGUMENT,"name had been given him in honour of Kosciuszko, as a token that he was"
734,ARGUMENT,"born at the time of the war11--""it is good, my Thaddeus, that you have"
735,ARGUMENT,"returned home this day, just when we have with us so many fair young"
736,ARGUMENT,ladies. Your uncle is thinking of soon celebrating your marriage. You have
737,ARGUMENT,a wide choice: at our house a numerous company has for days been gathering
738,ARGUMENT,"for the session of the territorial court, to conclude our ancient quarrel"
739,ARGUMENT,with the Count. The Count himself is to arrive to-morrow; the
740,ARGUMENT,Chamberlain12 is already here with his wife and daughters. The young men
741,ARGUMENT,"have gone to the wood to amuse themselves shooting, and the old men and"
742,ARGUMENT,"the women are looking at the harvest near the wood, where they are"
743,ARGUMENT,"doubtless awaiting the young men. Come on, if you wish, and soon we shall"
744,ARGUMENT,"meet your dear uncle, the Chamberlain, and the honoured ladies."""
745,ARGUMENT,
746,ARGUMENT,The Seneschal and Thaddeus walked along the road towards the wood and
747,ARGUMENT,could not say enough to each other. The sun was approaching the end of his
748,ARGUMENT,"course in the sky and shone less strongly but more broadly than by day,"
749,ARGUMENT,"all reddened, as the healthy face of a husbandman, when, after finishing"
750,ARGUMENT,"his work in the fields, he returns to rest: already the gleaming circle"
751,ARGUMENT,"was descending on the summit of the grove, and already the misty twilight,"
752,ARGUMENT,"filling the tips and the branches of the trees, bound and, as it were,"
753,ARGUMENT,"fused the whole forest into one mass, and the grove showed black like an"
754,ARGUMENT,"immense building, and the sun red above it like a fire on the roof; then"
755,ARGUMENT,"the sun sank; it still shone through the branches, as a candle through the"
756,ARGUMENT,chinks of window shutters; then it was extinguished. And suddenly the
757,ARGUMENT,"scythes that were ringing far and wide among the grain, and the rakes that"
758,ARGUMENT,"were being drawn over the meadow, became quiet and still; such were the"
759,ARGUMENT,"orders of the Judge, on whose farm work closed with the day. ""The Lord of"
760,ARGUMENT,"the world knows how long we should toil; when the sun, his workman,"
761,ARGUMENT,"descends from heaven, it is time for the husbandman to withdraw from the"
762,ARGUMENT,"field."" So the Judge was wont to speak, and the will of the Judge was"
763,ARGUMENT,sacred to the honest Steward; for even the waggons on which they had
764,ARGUMENT,"already begun to load the sheaves of grain, went unfilled to the stable;"
765,ARGUMENT,the oxen rejoiced in the unaccustomed lightness of their load.
766,ARGUMENT,
767,ARGUMENT,"The whole company was just returning from the grove, gaily, but in order;"
768,ARGUMENT,"first the little children with their tutor, then the Judge with the wife"
769,ARGUMENT,"of the Chamberlain; beside them the Chamberlain, surrounded by his family;"
770,ARGUMENT,"after the older people came the young ladies, with the young men beside"
771,ARGUMENT,them; the young ladies walked a half-step before the young men: so decorum
772,ARGUMENT,"bids. No one there had arranged the order, no one had so placed the"
773,ARGUMENT,"gentlemen and the ladies, but each without conscious thought kept the"
774,ARGUMENT,"order: for the Judge in his household observed the ancient customs, and"
775,ARGUMENT,"never allowed that respect should be neglected for age, birth,"
776,ARGUMENT,"intelligence, or office: ""By such breeding,"" said he, ""houses and nations"
777,ARGUMENT,"win fame, and with its fall, houses and nations go to ruin."" So the"
778,ARGUMENT,"household and the servants grew accustomed to order; and a passing guest,"
779,ARGUMENT,"whether kinsman or stranger, when he visited the Judge, as soon as he had"
780,ARGUMENT,"been there a short time, accepted the established ways of which all about"
781,ARGUMENT,him breathed.
782,ARGUMENT,
783,ARGUMENT,Short were the greetings that the Judge bestowed upon his nephew. With
784,ARGUMENT,"dignity he offered him his hand to salute, and kissing him on the temple"
785,ARGUMENT,he gave him a hearty welcome; though out of regard for the guests he
786,ARGUMENT,"talked little with him, one could see from the tears that he quickly wiped"
787,ARGUMENT,"away with the sleeve of his _kontusz_,13 how he loved young Thaddeus."
788,ARGUMENT,
789,ARGUMENT,"After the master all, both men and beasts, were returning home together"
790,ARGUMENT,"from the harvest fields and from the grove, from the meadows and from the"
791,ARGUMENT,pastures. Here a flock of bleating sheep squeezed into the lane and raised
792,ARGUMENT,a cloud of dust; behind them slowly stepped a herd of Tyrolese heifers
793,ARGUMENT,with brazen bells; there the horses neighing rushed home from the freshly
794,ARGUMENT,"mown meadow. All ran to the well, of which the wooden sweep ceaselessly"
795,ARGUMENT,creaked and filled the trough.
796,ARGUMENT,
797,ARGUMENT,"The Judge, though wearied, and though surrounded by guests, did not"
798,ARGUMENT,"neglect the weighty duties of his farm, but himself went to the well: at"
799,ARGUMENT,"evening a farmer can best see how his stable prospers, and never entrusts"
800,ARGUMENT,that care to servants--for the Judge knew that the master's eye fattens the
801,ARGUMENT,horse.
802,ARGUMENT,
803,ARGUMENT,"The Seneschal and Protazy the Apparitor14 were standing in the hall,"
804,ARGUMENT,"lanterns in hand, and were arguing with some warmth, for in the"
805,ARGUMENT,Seneschal's absence the Apparitor had secretly ordered the supper tables
806,ARGUMENT,to be carried out from the mansion and to be set up hastily in the old
807,ARGUMENT,castle of which the remains could be seen near the wood. Why this
808,ARGUMENT,transfer? The Seneschal made wry faces and begged the Judge's pardon; the
809,ARGUMENT,"Judge was amazed, but the thing had been done; it was already late and"
810,ARGUMENT,difficult to correct it; he preferred to make excuses to his guests and to
811,ARGUMENT,lead them to the ruins. On the way the Apparitor kept explaining to the
812,ARGUMENT,Judge why he had altered his master's arrangements: on the farm no room
813,ARGUMENT,was spacious enough for so many guests--and guests of such high station; in
814,ARGUMENT,"the castle the great hall was still well preserved, the vaulted roof was"
815,ARGUMENT,"whole--to be sure one wall was cracked and the windows were without panes,"
816,ARGUMENT,but in summer that would do no harm; the nearness of the cellars was
817,ARGUMENT,"convenient for the servants. So speaking, he winked at the Judge; it was"
818,ARGUMENT,"evident from his mien that he had other, more important reasons, but"
819,ARGUMENT,concealed them.
820,ARGUMENT,
821,ARGUMENT,"The castle stood two thousand paces from the mansion, of stately"
822,ARGUMENT,"architecture, and of imposing bulk, the ancestral home of the ancient"
823,ARGUMENT,house of the Horeszkos. The owner had perished at the time of the
824,ARGUMENT,disorders in the country;15 the domain had been entirely ruined by the
825,ARGUMENT,"sequestrations of the government, by the carelessness of the guardians,"
826,ARGUMENT,and by the verdicts of the courts; part had fallen to distant relatives on
827,ARGUMENT,"the female side, the rest had been divided among the creditors. No one"
828,ARGUMENT,"wished to take the castle, for a simple gentleman could hardly afford the"
829,ARGUMENT,"cost of maintaining it; but the Count, a rich young noble and a distant"
830,ARGUMENT,"relative of the Horeszkos, when he became of age and returned home from"
831,ARGUMENT,"his travels to live near by, took a fancy to the walls, explaining that"
832,ARGUMENT,"they were of Gothic architecture, though the Judge from documents tried to"
833,ARGUMENT,convince him that the architect was from Wilno and not a Goth. At all
834,ARGUMENT,"events the Count wished to have the castle, and suddenly the same desire"
835,ARGUMENT,"seized the Judge, no one could tell why. They began a suit in the district"
836,ARGUMENT,"court, then in the court of appeal, before the Senate, again in the"
837,ARGUMENT,district court and before the governor's council; finally after great
838,ARGUMENT,"expense of money, and numerous decrees, the case returned again to the"
839,ARGUMENT,court of domains.
840,ARGUMENT,
841,ARGUMENT,The Apparitor said rightly that in the hall of the castle there was room
842,ARGUMENT,both for the gentlemen of the bar and for the invited guests. This hall
843,ARGUMENT,"was as large as a refectory, and it had a vaulted roof supported on"
844,ARGUMENT,"pillars, and a stone flooring; the walls were unadorned, but clean. Upon"
845,ARGUMENT,"them were fastened the horns of stags and roes, with inscriptions telling"
846,ARGUMENT,where and when these trophies had been obtained; there too were engraved
847,ARGUMENT,"the armorial bearings of the hunters, with the name of each written out in"
848,ARGUMENT,"full; on the ceiling gleamed the Half-Goat, the arms of the Horeszkos."
849,ARGUMENT,
850,ARGUMENT,The guests entered in order and stood about the table. The Chamberlain
851,ARGUMENT,took his place at the head; this honour befitted him from his age and his
852,ARGUMENT,"office; advancing to it he bowed to the ladies, the old men, and the young"
853,ARGUMENT,"men. By him took his station a Bernardine monk, a collector of alms for"
854,ARGUMENT,"his order, and next the Bernardine was the Judge. The Bernardine"
855,ARGUMENT,"pronounced a short grace in Latin, brandy was passed to the gentlemen;"
856,ARGUMENT,"then all sat down, and silently and with relish they ate the cold"
857,ARGUMENT,Lithuanian salad of beet leaves.16
858,ARGUMENT,
859,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus, though a young man, by virtue of being a guest, had a seat at"
860,ARGUMENT,"the head of the table, with the ladies, beside His Honour the Chamberlain;"
861,ARGUMENT,"between him and his uncle there remained one empty place, which seemed to"
862,ARGUMENT,be awaiting some one. The uncle often glanced at this place and then at
863,ARGUMENT,"the door, as though he were assured of some one's coming and desired it;"
864,ARGUMENT,"and Thaddeus followed his uncle's glance to the door, and with him fixed"
865,ARGUMENT,"his eyes on the empty seat. Marvellous to relate, the places round about"
866,ARGUMENT,"were occupied by maidens on whom a prince might have gazed without shame,"
867,ARGUMENT,"all of them high born, and every one young and pretty; but Thaddeus kept"
868,ARGUMENT,looking at that spot where no one was sitting. That place was a riddle;
869,ARGUMENT,"young people love riddles. Distraught, to his fair neighbour the"
870,ARGUMENT,Chamberlain's daughter he said only a few scattering words; he did not
871,ARGUMENT,"change her plate or fill her glass, and he did not entertain the young"
872,ARGUMENT,ladies with polite discourse such as would have shown his city breeding.
873,ARGUMENT,"That one empty place allured him and dazzled him; it was no longer empty,"
874,ARGUMENT,for he had filled it with his thoughts. Over that place ran a thousand
875,ARGUMENT,"guesses, as after a rain, little toads hop hither and thither over a"
876,ARGUMENT,"lonely meadow; among them one form was queen, like a water lily on a fair"
877,ARGUMENT,day raising its white brow above the surface of a lake.
878,ARGUMENT,
879,ARGUMENT,"The third course was being served. The Chamberlain, pouring a drop of wine"
880,ARGUMENT,into Panna Rosa's glass and passing a plate of cucumbers to his younger
881,ARGUMENT,"daughter, said: ""I must wait on you myself, my dear daughters, though I am"
882,ARGUMENT,"old and clumsy."" Thereat several young men started up from the table and"
883,ARGUMENT,"served the young ladies. The Judge, throwing a sidelong glance at Thaddeus"
884,ARGUMENT,"and adjusting somewhat the sleeves of his kontusz, poured out some"
885,ARGUMENT,Hungarian wine and spoke thus:--
886,ARGUMENT,
887,ARGUMENT,"""To-day, as the new fashion bids us, we send our young men to the capital"
888,ARGUMENT,"to study, and I do not deny that our sons and grandsons have more book"
889,ARGUMENT,learning than their elders; but each day I perceive how our young men
890,ARGUMENT,suffer because there are no schools that teach how to conduct oneself in
891,ARGUMENT,"polite society. Of old, the young gentry went to the courts of the lords;"
892,ARGUMENT,"I myself was for ten years a member of the household of the Wojewoda,26"
893,ARGUMENT,"the father of His Honour the Chamberlain."" (As he said this he pressed the"
894,ARGUMENT,"Chamberlain's knees.) ""By his counsels he fitted me for the public"
895,ARGUMENT,"service, and did not dismiss me from his care until he had made a man of"
896,ARGUMENT,me. In my home his memory will ever be dear; each day do I pray God for
897,ARGUMENT,"his soul. If at his court I profited less than others, and since my return"
898,ARGUMENT,"have been ploughing the fields at home, while others, more worthy of the"
899,ARGUMENT,"regard of the Wojewoda, have since attained the highest offices in the"
900,ARGUMENT,"land, at least this much I profited, that in my home no one will ever"
901,ARGUMENT,reproach me for failing to show respect or courtesy to all--and boldly do I
902,ARGUMENT,"say it, courtesy is not an easy science, nor one of slight account. Not"
903,ARGUMENT,"easy, for it is not confined to moving one's legs gracefully in bowing or"
904,ARGUMENT,to greeting with a smile each man one meets; for such fashionable courtesy
905,ARGUMENT,"seems to me that of a merchant, not that of old Poland, nor that of a true"
906,ARGUMENT,"gentleman. Courtesy should be extended to all, but for each it is"
907,ARGUMENT,different; for not without courtesy is the love of children for their
908,ARGUMENT,"parents, or the regard paid by a husband to his wife in society, or that"
909,ARGUMENT,"of a master for his servants, and yet each sort of courtesy has its"
910,ARGUMENT,distinctive mark. One must study long in order without mistake to pay to
911,ARGUMENT,each his due respect. And our elders did study: in noble mansions the
912,ARGUMENT,"discourse furnished the listener a living history of his land, and the"
913,ARGUMENT,talk among the gentry formed the household annals of the county. Thereby a
914,ARGUMENT,brother gentleman was made to feel that all knew of him and did not esteem
915,ARGUMENT,him lightly; so a gentleman kept a watch upon his own habits. But to-day
916,ARGUMENT,"you must ask no man who he is or of what parents, with whom he has lived"
917,ARGUMENT,"or what he has done. Every man enters where he will, so long as he be not"
918,ARGUMENT,"a government spy or a beggar. As Vespasian did not smell of money,17 and"
919,ARGUMENT,"cared not to know whence it came, from what hands or lands, so now they"
920,ARGUMENT,care not to know a man's family or habits. It suffices that he be of full
921,ARGUMENT,weight and that the stamp be seen upon him; thus men value friends as Jews
922,ARGUMENT,"value money."""
923,ARGUMENT,
924,ARGUMENT,"While speaking thus, the Judge surveyed his guests in order; for though he"
925,ARGUMENT,"always spoke fluently and with discretion, he knew that the youth of"
926,ARGUMENT,"to-day are impatient, that they are bored by long speeches, even by the"
927,ARGUMENT,most eloquent. But all were listening in deep silence; the Judge with his
928,ARGUMENT,eye seemed to take counsel of the Chamberlain; the Chamberlain did not
929,ARGUMENT,"interrupt the speech by praise, but with a frequent nodding of his head he"
930,ARGUMENT,"assented to it. The Judge ceased speaking, the other with a nod begged him"
931,ARGUMENT,"to continue. So the Judge filled the Chamberlain's beaker and his own cup,"
932,ARGUMENT,and spoke further:--
933,ARGUMENT,
934,ARGUMENT,"""Courtesy is no slight thing: when a man learns to respect as is fitting"
935,ARGUMENT,"the age, birth, virtues, and ways of others, at the same time he comes to"
936,ARGUMENT,"recognise also his own dignity; as in weighing with scales, in order to"
937,ARGUMENT,"learn our own weight, we must put some one in the opposite pan. And worthy"
938,ARGUMENT,of your especial attention is the courtesy that young men owe to the fair
939,ARGUMENT,"sex, above all when the distinction of family, and the generosity of"
940,ARGUMENT,fortune heighten inborn charms and talents. Through courtesy is the path
941,ARGUMENT,"to the affections, and by it houses are joined in splendid union--thus"
942,ARGUMENT,"thought our elders. And therefore----"""
943,ARGUMENT,
944,ARGUMENT,Here the Judge with a sudden turn of his head nodded at Thaddeus and
945,ARGUMENT,bestowed on him a stern glance; it was evident that he had now reached the
946,ARGUMENT,climax of his speech.
947,ARGUMENT,
948,ARGUMENT,Thereupon the Chamberlain tapped his golden snuffbox and said:--
949,ARGUMENT,
950,ARGUMENT,"""My dear Judge, in former times it was still worse. At present I know not"
951,ARGUMENT,"whether the fashion changes even us old men, or whether the young men are"
952,ARGUMENT,"better than before, but I see less cause of scandal. Ah, I remember the"
953,ARGUMENT,times when on our fatherland there first descended the fashion of
954,ARGUMENT,imitating the French; when suddenly brisk young gentlemen from foreign
955,ARGUMENT,"lands swarmed in upon us in a horde worse than the Nogai Tatars, abusing"
956,ARGUMENT,"here, in our country, God, the faith of our fathers, our law and customs,"
957,ARGUMENT,and even our ancient garments. Pitiable was it to behold the yellow-faced
958,ARGUMENT,"puppies, talking through their noses--and often without noses--stuffed with"
959,ARGUMENT,"brochures and newspapers of various sorts, and proclaiming new faiths,"
960,ARGUMENT,"laws, and toilets. That rabble had a mighty power over minds, for when the"
961,ARGUMENT,Lord God sends punishment on a nation he first deprives its citizens of
962,ARGUMENT,"reason. And so the wiser heads dared not resist the fops, and the whole"
963,ARGUMENT,"nation feared them as some pestilence, for within itself it already felt"
964,ARGUMENT,the germs of disease. They cried out against the dandies but took pattern
965,ARGUMENT,"by them; they changed faith, speech, laws, and costumes. That was a"
966,ARGUMENT,"masquerade, the licence of the Carnival season, after which was soon to"
967,ARGUMENT,follow the Lent of slavery.
968,ARGUMENT,
969,ARGUMENT,"""I remember,--though then I was but a little child,--when the Cup-Bearer's"
970,ARGUMENT,"son came to visit my father in the district of Oszmiana, in a French"
971,ARGUMENT,carriage; he was the first man in Lithuania who wore French clothes.
972,ARGUMENT,Everybody ran after him as after a buzzard;18 they envied the house before
973,ARGUMENT,"the threshold of which the Cup-Bearer's son halted his two-wheeled chaise,"
974,ARGUMENT,which passed by the French name of cabriolet. Within it sat two dogs
975,ARGUMENT,"instead of footmen, and on the box a German, lean as a board; his long"
976,ARGUMENT,"legs, thin as hop-poles, were clad in stockings, and shoes with silver"
977,ARGUMENT,buckles; the tail of his wig was tied up in a sack. The old men burst out
978,ARGUMENT,"laughing at that equipage, but the country boors crossed themselves,"
979,ARGUMENT,saying that a Venetian devil was travelling abroad in a German carriage.
980,ARGUMENT,To describe the son of the Cup-Bearer himself would be a long story;
981,ARGUMENT,suffice it to say that he seemed to us an ape or a parrot in a great
982,ARGUMENT,"peruke, which he liked to compare to the Golden Fleece, and we to"
983,ARGUMENT,elf-locks.19 At that time even if any one felt that the Polish costume was
984,ARGUMENT,"more comely than this aping of a foreign fashion, he kept silent, for the"
985,ARGUMENT,"young men would have cried out that he was hindering culture, that he was"
986,ARGUMENT,"checking progress, that he was a traitor. Such at that time was the power"
987,ARGUMENT,of prejudice!
988,ARGUMENT,
989,ARGUMENT,"""The Cup-Bearer's son announced that he was going to reform us and"
990,ARGUMENT,introduce order and civilisation; he proclaimed to us that some eloquent
991,ARGUMENT,"Frenchmen had made a discovery, that all men are equal--though this was"
992,ARGUMENT,written long ago in Holy Writ and every parish priest prates of it from
993,ARGUMENT,"the pulpit. The doctrine was ancient, the question was of its application."
994,ARGUMENT,But at that time such general blindness prevailed that they did not
995,ARGUMENT,believe the oldest things in the world if they did not read of them in a
996,ARGUMENT,"French newspaper. The Cup-Bearer's son, despite equality, had taken the"
997,ARGUMENT,"title of marquis. It is well known that titles come from Paris, and at"
998,ARGUMENT,"that time the title of marquis was in fashion there; however, when in the"
999,ARGUMENT,"course of years the fashion changed, this same marquis took the title of"
1000,ARGUMENT,"democrat; finally, with the changing fashion, under Napoleon, the democrat"
1001,ARGUMENT,"arrived from Paris as a baron; if he had lived longer, perhaps he would"
1002,ARGUMENT,"have shifted again, and instead of a baron would have called himself once"
1003,ARGUMENT,"more a democrat. For Paris boasts of frequent changes of fashion, and"
1004,ARGUMENT,whatever a Frenchman invents is dear to a Pole.
1005,ARGUMENT,
1006,ARGUMENT,"""Thank God, that now if our young men go abroad, it is no longer for"
1007,ARGUMENT,"clothes, nor to seek new laws in wretched printing shops, nor to study"
1008,ARGUMENT,"eloquence in the cafes of Paris. For now Napoleon, a clever man and a"
1009,ARGUMENT,"swift, gives us no time to prate or to search for new fashions. Now there"
1010,ARGUMENT,"is the thunder of arms, and the hearts of us old men exult that the renown"
1011,ARGUMENT,of the Poles is spreading so widely throughout the world; glory is ours
1012,ARGUMENT,"already, and so we shall soon again have our Republic. From laurels always"
1013,ARGUMENT,springs the tree of liberty. Only it is sad that for us the years drag on
1014,ARGUMENT,"so long in idleness, and they are always so far away. It is so long to"
1015,ARGUMENT,"wait!, and even news is so scarce. Father Robak,""20 he said in a lower"
1016,ARGUMENT,"voice to the Bernardine, ""I have heard that you have received tidings from"
1017,ARGUMENT,"beyond the Niemen; perhaps you know something of our army?"""
1018,ARGUMENT,
1019,ARGUMENT,"""Not a thing,"" answered Robak with indifference; it was evident that he"
1020,ARGUMENT,"had not enjoyed listening to the talk. ""Politics bore me; if I have a"
1021,ARGUMENT,"letter from Warsaw, it is on business of our Order. That is the affair of"
1022,ARGUMENT,us Bernardines; why should we talk of that at supper? Here there are
1023,ARGUMENT,"laymen, whom such things do not concern."""
1024,ARGUMENT,
1025,ARGUMENT,"So speaking, he looked askance at a Muscovite guest who was sitting among"
1026,ARGUMENT,"the banqueters; this was Captain Rykov, an old soldier who was quartered"
1027,ARGUMENT,"in a village hard by, and whom the Judge for courtesy's sake had invited"
1028,ARGUMENT,"to the supper. Rykov ate with a relish, and had been mixing little in the"
1029,ARGUMENT,"conversation, but at the mention of Warsaw he raised his head and said,"
1030,ARGUMENT,"with a Russian accent, and with a few slips of expression:--"
1031,ARGUMENT,
1032,ARGUMENT,"""Chamberlain! Ah, sir, you are always curious about Bonaparte, and are"
1033,ARGUMENT,"always eager to hear from Warsaw. Ah, Fatherland! I am no spy, but I"
1034,ARGUMENT,"understand Polish.--Fatherland! I feel it all, I understand! You are Poles,"
1035,ARGUMENT,"I am Russian; just now we are not fighting--there is an armistice, so we"
1036,ARGUMENT,are eating and drinking together. Often at the outposts our fellows will
1037,ARGUMENT,"be chatting with the French and drinking brandy; when they cry 'Hurrah,'"
1038,ARGUMENT,then comes the cannonading. There's a Russian proverb: 'I love the man I
1039,ARGUMENT,"fight with; clasp your sweetheart to your heart, but beat her like a fur"
1040,ARGUMENT,cloak.' I say we shall have war. An adjutant of the staff came to Major
1041,ARGUMENT,Plut21 the day before yesterday: 'Get ready for the march!' We shall move
1042,ARGUMENT,"either against the Turks or the French. O, that Bonaparte is a rare bird!"
1043,ARGUMENT,Now that Suvorov is gone maybe he will give us a drubbing. In our regiment
1044,ARGUMENT,"we used to say, when we were marching against the French, that Bonaparte"
1045,ARGUMENT,"was a wizard22--well, so was Suvorov a wizard too, so there were tricks"
1046,ARGUMENT,"against tricks. Once in battle, where did he disappear? To look for"
1047,ARGUMENT,"Bonaparte! But he changed himself into a fox, so Suvorov became a hound;"
1048,ARGUMENT,"so Bonaparte changed again into a cat; they started to claw each other,"
1049,ARGUMENT,but Suvorov became a pony. Now notice what happened with Bonaparte
1050,ARGUMENT,"finally----"""
1051,ARGUMENT,
1052,ARGUMENT,Here Rykov broke off and began to eat. At that moment the servant came in
1053,ARGUMENT,"with the fourth course, and suddenly the side doors were opened."
1054,ARGUMENT,
1055,ARGUMENT,"A new guest, young and fair, came in; her sudden appearance, her beauty"
1056,ARGUMENT,"and her carriage, her toilet, all attracted the eye. Everybody greeted"
1057,ARGUMENT,her; evidently all except Thaddeus were acquainted with her. Her figure
1058,ARGUMENT,"was fine and elegant, her bosom charming; her gown was of pink silk, low"
1059,ARGUMENT,"cut, and with short sleeves, the collar of lace. In her hands she twirled"
1060,ARGUMENT,"a fan for mere pastime, for it was not hot; the gilded fan as it waved"
1061,ARGUMENT,spread around it a dense shower of sparks. Her head was like a milliner's
1062,ARGUMENT,model; the hair was frizzled and curled and intertwined with pink ribbons;
1063,ARGUMENT,"amid them a diamond, half hidden from sight, shone like a star in the tail"
1064,ARGUMENT,of a comet. In a word it was a holiday toilet; several whispered that it
1065,ARGUMENT,was too elaborate for the country and for every day. Though her skirt was
1066,ARGUMENT,"short, the eye could not see her feet, for she ran very swiftly, or rather"
1067,ARGUMENT,"she glided, like the puppets that on the Festival of the Three Kings boys"
1068,ARGUMENT,"hidden in booths slide to and fro. She ran in and, greeting all with a"
1069,ARGUMENT,"slight bow, was about to seat herself in the place reserved for her. That"
1070,ARGUMENT,"was difficult, for there were no chairs for the guests, who were sitting"
1071,ARGUMENT,in four rows on four benches; either a whole row must move or she must
1072,ARGUMENT,climb over the bench. Skilfully she managed to squeeze in between two
1073,ARGUMENT,"benches, and then between the table and the line of those seated at it she"
1074,ARGUMENT,rolled on like a billiard ball. In her course she brushed past our young
1075,ARGUMENT,"man, and, catching a flounce on some one's knee, slipped a little, and in"
1076,ARGUMENT,her distraction supported herself on the shoulder of Thaddeus. Politely
1077,ARGUMENT,"begging his pardon, she took her seat between him and his uncle, but she"
1078,ARGUMENT,"ate nothing; she only fanned herself, or twirled the handle of her fan, or"
1079,ARGUMENT,"adjusted her lace collar, or with a light touch of her hand smoothed her"
1080,ARGUMENT,ringlets and the knots of bright ribbon among them.
1081,ARGUMENT,
1082,ARGUMENT,This interruption of the conversation had lasted some four minutes.
1083,ARGUMENT,Meanwhile there had begun at the end of the table first gentle murmurs and
1084,ARGUMENT,then conversation in a subdued voice; the men were discussing their day's
1085,ARGUMENT,hunting. Between the Assessor23 and the Notary24 there had arisen a
1086,ARGUMENT,"stubborn and more and more noisy dispute over a bobtailed hound, in the"
1087,ARGUMENT,"ownership of which the Notary took pride, maintaining that this dog had"
1088,ARGUMENT,"caught the hare; while the Assessor was demonstrating, despite the"
1089,ARGUMENT,"arguments of the Notary, that that honour belonged to his own hound"
1090,ARGUMENT,Falcon. They asked the opinion of the others; so all in turn took sides
1091,ARGUMENT,"either for Bobtail or for Falcon, some as experts, others as eyewitnesses."
1092,ARGUMENT,At the opposite end of the table the Judge was saying in a low voice to
1093,ARGUMENT,"his new neighbour: ""I beg your pardon, we had to sit down, it was"
1094,ARGUMENT,"impossible to put off supper till later; the guests were hungry, for they"
1095,ARGUMENT,had had a long walk over the fields; and I thought that to-day you would
1096,ARGUMENT,"not join us at table."" After these words he talked quietly with the"
1097,ARGUMENT,Chamberlain over a full winecup about political affairs.
1098,ARGUMENT,
1099,ARGUMENT,"Since both ends of the table were thus occupied, Thaddeus gazed intently"
1100,ARGUMENT,at the unknown lady. He remembered that when he had first glanced at the
1101,ARGUMENT,"place he had at once guessed for whom it was destined. He blushed, and his"
1102,ARGUMENT,"heart beat faster than its wont. So he now beheld, the solution of the"
1103,ARGUMENT,mystery upon which he had pondered. So it had been ordained that by his
1104,ARGUMENT,side should sit that beauty whom he had seen in the twilight; to be sure
1105,ARGUMENT,"she now seemed of taller stature, for she was in full dress, and costume"
1106,ARGUMENT,may make one seem larger or smaller. But the hair of the first had seemed
1107,ARGUMENT,"short and of a bright golden colour, while this lady had long, curling,"
1108,ARGUMENT,"raven tresses. The colour must have come from the sun's rays, which at"
1109,ARGUMENT,evenfall shed a glow over everything. At that time he had not noticed the
1110,ARGUMENT,girl's face--she had vanished too quickly. But thought is wont to guess a
1111,ARGUMENT,"lovely face; he had imagined that surely she must have black eyes, a fair"
1112,ARGUMENT,"complexion, and lips as red as twin cherries; in his neighbour he found"
1113,ARGUMENT,"such a face, such eyes, and such lips. In age perhaps there was the"
1114,ARGUMENT,"greatest difference; the little gardener had seemed to him a young girl,"
1115,ARGUMENT,this lady was already of ripe years. But youth never asks beauty for its
1116,ARGUMENT,"baptismal certificate; to a young man every woman is young, to a lad every"
1117,ARGUMENT,"beauty seems of his own age, and to an innocent boy every sweetheart seems"
1118,ARGUMENT,a maiden.
1119,ARGUMENT,
1120,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus, though he was now almost twenty years of age, and from childhood"
1121,ARGUMENT,"had dwelt in Wilno, a large city, had been under the charge of a priest,"
1122,ARGUMENT,who looked after him and brought him up in the rules of strict
1123,ARGUMENT,old-fashioned virtue. Therefore Thaddeus brought home to his native heath
1124,ARGUMENT,"a pure soul, a lively imagination, and an innocent heart, but at the same"
1125,ARGUMENT,time no small desire to sow his wild oats. He had some time ago resolved
1126,ARGUMENT,that he would permit himself to enjoy in the country his long forbidden
1127,ARGUMENT,"liberty; he knew that he was handsome, he felt himself young and vigorous;"
1128,ARGUMENT,and as an inheritance from his parents he had received health and good
1129,ARGUMENT,"spirits. His name was Soplica; all the Soplicas, as is well known, are"
1130,ARGUMENT,"large, strong, powerful men, apt at the soldier's trade, but less diligent"
1131,ARGUMENT,over their books.
1132,ARGUMENT,
1133,ARGUMENT,Thaddeus had not degenerated from his forebears; he rode well on horseback
1134,ARGUMENT,"and walked well; he was not dull, but he had made little progress in his"
1135,ARGUMENT,"studies, though his uncle had spared nothing on his education. He liked"
1136,ARGUMENT,"better to shoot, or to practise with a sabre; he knew that they had"
1137,ARGUMENT,"intended to fit him for the army, that his father in his will had"
1138,ARGUMENT,expressed this desire; while sitting in school he yearned constantly for
1139,ARGUMENT,the sound of the drum. But his uncle had suddenly changed his first
1140,ARGUMENT,"intentions, and had sent him word to come home and to marry and take over"
1141,ARGUMENT,"the farming; he had promised to give him at first a little village, and"
1142,ARGUMENT,later the whole estate.
1143,ARGUMENT,
1144,ARGUMENT,All these virtues and good qualities of Thaddeus had attracted the gaze of
1145,ARGUMENT,"his neighbour, an observant woman. She had measured his tall and shapely"
1146,ARGUMENT,"form, his strong shoulders, his broad chest, and she looked into his face,"
1147,ARGUMENT,on which a blush rose as often as the young man met her eyes. For he had
1148,ARGUMENT,"already entirely recovered from his first timidity, and looked on her with"
1149,ARGUMENT,"a bold glance, in which fire blazed; even so did she gaze on him, and"
1150,ARGUMENT,their four pupils glowed opposite one another as do candles at the Advent
1151,ARGUMENT,mass.
1152,ARGUMENT,
1153,ARGUMENT,She started a conversation with him in French. Thaddeus had returned from
1154,ARGUMENT,"town, from school: so she asked his opinions about new books and authors,"
1155,ARGUMENT,and from his answers derived new questions; she went so far as to speak of
1156,ARGUMENT,"painting, of music, of dancing--even of sculpture! She proved herself"
1157,ARGUMENT,"equally familiar with the pencil, with tunes, and with books, until"
1158,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus was petrified by so much learning, and feared that he might"
1159,ARGUMENT,"become the butt of ridicule, and stammered like a little lad before his"
1160,ARGUMENT,teacher. Luckily the teacher was beautiful and lenient; his neighbour
1161,ARGUMENT,"guessed the cause of his perturbation, and shifted the talk to less deep"
1162,ARGUMENT,"and difficult subjects, to the cares and troubles of existence in the"
1163,ARGUMENT,"country, and how one must amuse oneself, and how divide the time in order"
1164,ARGUMENT,"to make village life gay and pleasant. Thaddeus answered more boldly, and"
1165,ARGUMENT,"things went better; in a half-hour they were already fast friends, they"
1166,ARGUMENT,even started jests and small quarrels. Finally she placed before him three
1167,ARGUMENT,"little balls of bread, three persons to select from; he chose the nearest."
1168,ARGUMENT,The two daughters of the Chamberlain frowned at this; his neighbour
1169,ARGUMENT,"laughed, but she did not tell him whom that happy ball was meant to"
1170,ARGUMENT,signify.
1171,ARGUMENT,
1172,ARGUMENT,At the other end of the table they were amusing themselves quite
1173,ARGUMENT,"differently, for there the adherents of Falcon, suddenly gathering"
1174,ARGUMENT,"strength, descended pitilessly on the party of Bobtail. Mighty was the"
1175,ARGUMENT,"strife; they had not yet eaten the last courses; standing up and drinking,"
1176,ARGUMENT,the two factions wrangled. But most terribly was the Notary ruffled--just
1177,ARGUMENT,"like a blackcock; when he had once begun, he poured forth his speech"
1178,ARGUMENT,"without a pause, and adorned it most effectively by his gestures. (The"
1179,ARGUMENT,"Notary, Pan Bolesta, had once been a lawyer; they called him the preacher,"
1180,ARGUMENT,because he was over fond of gestures.) Now he had placed his hands on his
1181,ARGUMENT,"sides, extending his elbows backward, and from under his armpits he was"
1182,ARGUMENT,"thrusting forward his fingers and long nails, thereby representing two"
1183,ARGUMENT,leashes of hounds. He was just concluding his speech:--
1184,ARGUMENT,
1185,ARGUMENT,"""Hurrah! The Assessor and I let them go at once, at the very same time, as"
1186,ARGUMENT,if the two triggers on a double-barrelled gun had been pressed by one
1187,ARGUMENT,"finger. Hurrah! They started, and the hare like an arrow shot into the"
1188,ARGUMENT,"field; the dogs after him----"" (Here as he spoke he ran his hands over the"
1189,ARGUMENT,table and with his fingers marvellously imitated the movement of the dogs)
1190,ARGUMENT,"""the dogs after him, and they headed him off a bit from the wood. Falcon"
1191,ARGUMENT,"rushed forward, a fleet dog, but with a poor head; he got the start of"
1192,ARGUMENT,"Bobtail by so much, a finger's breadth; I knew that he would miss. The"
1193,ARGUMENT,"hare was no common rogue; he made as if straight for the field, and after"
1194,ARGUMENT,him the pack of hounds. The rogue of a hare I Once he knew that the dogs
1195,ARGUMENT,"were in a bunch, pst! he went to the right, with a somersault, and after"
1196,ARGUMENT,"him the stupid hounds; but again, zip! to the left, in just two jumps. The"
1197,ARGUMENT,"dogs after him, zip! to the left, and my Bobtail, whack!"""
1198,ARGUMENT,
1199,ARGUMENT,Shouting thus the Notary leaned over the table and ran his fingers clear
1200,ARGUMENT,"to the other side, and screamed ""whack"" just over the ear of Thaddeus."
1201,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus and his neighbour, suddenly startled right in the middle of a"
1202,ARGUMENT,"conversation by this outburst, involuntarily withdrew their heads from"
1203,ARGUMENT,"each other, like treetops tied together, when the storm parts them; their"
1204,ARGUMENT,"hands, which had been lying close together under the table, quickly drew"
1205,ARGUMENT,"apart, and their two faces were clothed with a single blush."
1206,ARGUMENT,
1207,ARGUMENT,"""It is true, my dear Notary,"" said Thaddeus, in order not to betray his"
1208,ARGUMENT,"embarrassment, ""it is true, without doubt; Bobtail is a finely built"
1209,ARGUMENT,"hound--if he is equally good at seizing the game."""
1210,ARGUMENT,
1211,ARGUMENT,"""Good at seizing!"" cried the Notary, ""my favourite dog; the idea of his"
1212,ARGUMENT,"not being good at seizing!"""
1213,ARGUMENT,
1214,ARGUMENT,So Thaddeus once more expressed his pleasure that so handsome a dog had no
1215,ARGUMENT,fault; regretted that he had seen him only as he was returning from the
1216,ARGUMENT,"wood, and that he had not had time to appreciate all his good points."
1217,ARGUMENT,
1218,ARGUMENT,"At this the Assessor trembled, dropped his wine-glass from his hand, and"
1219,ARGUMENT,levelled at Thaddeus the glance of a basilisk. The Assessor was less noisy
1220,ARGUMENT,"and less given to gestures than the Notary, thinner and shorter; but he"
1221,ARGUMENT,"was terrible at masquerade, ball, or village diet, for they said of him"
1222,ARGUMENT,that he had a sting in his tongue. He could make up such witty jests that
1223,ARGUMENT,you might have had them printed in the almanac; they were all so malicious
1224,ARGUMENT,"and pointed. He had formerly been a man of property, but he had entirely"
1225,ARGUMENT,"squandered his inheritance from his father, and his brother's estate as"
1226,ARGUMENT,"well, through cutting a figure in high society; now he had entered the"
1227,ARGUMENT,"service of the government, in order to be of some importance in the"
1228,ARGUMENT,"district. He was very fond of hunting, both for the sport of it and"
1229,ARGUMENT,because the peal of the horn and the sight of the circle of beaters
1230,ARGUMENT,"recalled to him the days of his youth, when he had kept many hunters and"
1231,ARGUMENT,"many famous hounds. Of his whole kennel but two dogs remained, and now"
1232,ARGUMENT,"they wanted to belittle the glory of one of these! So he approached, and,"
1233,ARGUMENT,"slowly stroking his side whiskers, said with a laugh--but it was a laugh"
1234,ARGUMENT,full of poison:--
1235,ARGUMENT,
1236,ARGUMENT,"""A hound without a tail is like a gentleman without an office. A tail is"
1237,ARGUMENT,"likewise a great help to a hound in running. And do you, sir, regard the"
1238,ARGUMENT,"lack of one as a proof of excellence? However, we may refer the matter to"
1239,ARGUMENT,the judgment of your aunt. Though Pani Telimena has been living in the
1240,ARGUMENT,"capital, and has only recently been visiting our neighbourhood, yet she"
1241,ARGUMENT,knows more about hunting than do young sportsmen: for knowledge comes of
1242,ARGUMENT,"itself with years."""
1243,ARGUMENT,
1244,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus, upon whom this thunderstorm had unexpectedly descended, arose in"
1245,ARGUMENT,"confusion, and for some moments said nothing, but looked upon his rival"
1246,ARGUMENT,more and more terribly and sternly; at that moment by great good luck the
1247,ARGUMENT,"Chamberlain sneezed twice. ""Vivat!"" cried everybody; he bowed to the"
1248,ARGUMENT,"company, and slowly tapped his snuffbox with his fingers. The snuffbox was"
1249,ARGUMENT,"of gold, set with diamonds, and in the middle of it was a portrait of King"
1250,ARGUMENT,Stanislaw.25 The king himself had given it to the father of the
1251,ARGUMENT,Chamberlain; after his father the Chamberlain bore it worthily; whenever
1252,ARGUMENT,"he tapped upon it, it was a sign that he wished to have the floor for a"
1253,ARGUMENT,"speech. All became silent, no one dared open his lips. He spoke:--"
1254,ARGUMENT,
1255,ARGUMENT,"""Honoured gentlemen, my beloved brothers, the woods and meadows alone are"
1256,ARGUMENT,"the hunter's forum, therefore such matters I will not pass upon within"
1257,ARGUMENT,"doors, but I will dissolve our sitting until to-morrow, and will not"
1258,ARGUMENT,"permit further argument from either faction to-day. Apparitor, call the"
1259,ARGUMENT,case for to-morrow in the field! To-morrow the Count too will be here with
1260,ARGUMENT,"all his hunting train, and you, my neighbour Judge, will ride out with us,"
1261,ARGUMENT,"and Pani Telimena, and the young ladies and gentlemen; in a word we will"
1262,ARGUMENT,"form a great official hunting party, and the Seneschal, too, will not deny"
1263,ARGUMENT,"us his companionship."""
1264,ARGUMENT,
1265,ARGUMENT,So saying he offered his snuffbox to the old man.
1266,ARGUMENT,
1267,ARGUMENT,The Seneschal had been sitting at the corner among the hunters; he had
1268,ARGUMENT,"been listening with closed eyes, but had said not a word, although the"
1269,ARGUMENT,"young men had often inquired his opinion, for no one understood hunting"
1270,ARGUMENT,"better than he. He kept silent, weighed in his fingers the pinch of snuff"
1271,ARGUMENT,"that he had taken from the box, and meditated long before he finally used"
1272,ARGUMENT,"it; he sneezed until the whole room echoed, and shaking his head, he said"
1273,ARGUMENT,with a bitter smile:--
1274,ARGUMENT,
1275,ARGUMENT,"""O how this saddens and amazes me in my old age! What would the hunters of"
1276,ARGUMENT,"old times say of this, if they should see that amid so many gentlemen, in"
1277,ARGUMENT,"so large a gathering, disputes over a hound's tail had to be debated? What"
1278,ARGUMENT,would old Rejtan say of this were he to come to life again? He would go
1279,ARGUMENT,back to Lachowicze and lay himself in his grave. What would the old
1280,ARGUMENT,"wojewoda Niesiolowski26 say, a man who still has the finest kennel in the"
1281,ARGUMENT,"world, and maintains in lordly wise two hundred hunters, and who has a"
1282,ARGUMENT,"hundred waggon-loads of nets in his castle of Woroncza, and yet for so"
1283,ARGUMENT,many years has been abiding like a monk within his house? No one can
1284,ARGUMENT,persuade him to accept an invitation to hunt; he refused even
1285,ARGUMENT,Bialopiotrowicz27 himself! For what would he capture at your hunts? It
1286,ARGUMENT,"would be fine glory, if such a gentleman, in accordance with the present"
1287,ARGUMENT,"fashion, should ride out against rabbits! In my time, sir, in hunter's"
1288,ARGUMENT,"language, the boar, the bear, the elk, the wolf were known as noble"
1289,ARGUMENT,"beasts, but beasts without tusks, horns, or claws were left for hired"
1290,ARGUMENT,servants or farm labourers. No gentleman would ever consent to take in
1291,ARGUMENT,hand a musket that had been put to shame by having small shot sprinkled in
1292,ARGUMENT,"it! To be sure they kept hounds, for when they were returning from a hunt"
1293,ARGUMENT,it might happen that some wretched hare would start up from beneath a
1294,ARGUMENT,"steed; then they let loose the pack at it for sport, and the little lads"
1295,ARGUMENT,"chased it on ponies before the eyes of their parents, who hardly deigned"
1296,ARGUMENT,"to look on such a chase, much less to quarrel over it! So I beg that Your"
1297,ARGUMENT,"Honour the Chamberlain will deign to recall your commands, and will"
1298,ARGUMENT,"forgive me that I cannot ride to such a hunting party, and never will set"
1299,ARGUMENT,"foot in one! My name is Hreczecha, and since the days of King Lech28 no"
1300,ARGUMENT,"Hreczecha has ever ridden out after hares."""
1301,ARGUMENT,
1302,ARGUMENT,Here the laughter of the young men drowned the speech of the Seneschal.
1303,ARGUMENT,They rose from the table; the Chamberlain moved first; this honour
1304,ARGUMENT,befitted him from his age and his office; as he advanced he bowed to the
1305,ARGUMENT,"ladies, the old men, and the young men. After him went the Collector of"
1306,ARGUMENT,"Alms, and the Judge alongside the Bernardine; at the threshold the Judge"
1307,ARGUMENT,"offered his arm to the Chamberlain's wife, Thaddeus to Telimena, the"
1308,ARGUMENT,"Assessor to the Carver's daughter, and finally the Notary to Panna"
1309,ARGUMENT,"Hreczecha, the daughter of the Seneschal."
1310,ARGUMENT,
1311,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus went to the stable with several of the guests, and felt"
1312,ARGUMENT,"disturbed, glum, and morose; he thought over all the events of the day,"
1313,ARGUMENT,the meeting and the supper by the side of his fair neighbour--and in
1314,ARGUMENT,"particular the word ""aunt"" buzzed continually in his ear like an"
1315,ARGUMENT,importunate fly. He would have liked to learn more about Pani Telimena
1316,ARGUMENT,"from the Apparitor, but he could not catch him; nor did he see the"
1317,ARGUMENT,"Seneschal, for immediately after supper all had followed the guests out,"
1318,ARGUMENT,"as befits serving men, and had gone to prepare the rooms for rest. The"
1319,ARGUMENT,"older people and the ladies slept in the mansion; the young men Thaddeus,"
1320,ARGUMENT,"as the host's representative, had been directed to take to the stable,"
1321,ARGUMENT,where they were to sleep on the hay.
1322,ARGUMENT,
1323,ARGUMENT,Within a half-hour it was as quiet on the whole estate as in a cloister
1324,ARGUMENT,after the bell for prayer; the silence was interrupted only by the voice
1325,ARGUMENT,of the night watchman. All were asleep. The Judge alone did not close his
1326,ARGUMENT,"eyes; as the head of the estate, he was thinking over a walking party, and"
1327,ARGUMENT,"the coming entertainment within the house. He gave orders to the stewards,"
1328,ARGUMENT,"the overseers, and the grain-wardens; to the scribes, the housekeeper, the"
1329,ARGUMENT,"huntsmen, and the grooms; and he had to look through all the day's"
1330,ARGUMENT,accounts; finally he told the Apparitor that he wished to undress. The
1331,ARGUMENT,"Apparitor undid his belt, a belt from Sluck,29 a massive belt, on which"
1332,ARGUMENT,glittered tassels thick as helmet-plumes; on one side it was gold brocade
1333,ARGUMENT,"with purple flowers, on the reverse black silk with silver cross-stripes."
1334,ARGUMENT,"Such a belt may be worn equally well on either side, golden for a holiday,"
1335,ARGUMENT,and black for mourning. The Apparitor alone knew how to undo and fold up
1336,ARGUMENT,this belt; he took this trouble upon himself and ended with the following
1337,ARGUMENT,speech:--
1338,ARGUMENT,
1339,ARGUMENT,"""Where was the harm that I moved the tables to the old castle? No one has"
1340,ARGUMENT,"lost thereby, and you, sir, will perhaps gain, for the suit now before the"
1341,ARGUMENT,court concerns the ownership of that castle. From this day we have
1342,ARGUMENT,"acquired a right to the castle, and notwithstanding all the fury of the"
1343,ARGUMENT,opposite side I will prove that we have taken the castle into our
1344,ARGUMENT,possession. For whoever invites guests to supper in a castle proves that
1345,ARGUMENT,he holds possession there--or takes it; we will even summon the opposite
1346,ARGUMENT,"side as witnesses: I remember such happenings in my time."""
1347,ARGUMENT,
1348,ARGUMENT,The Judge was already asleep. So the Apparitor quietly went out into the
1349,ARGUMENT,"hall, seated himself by a candle, and took from his pocket a little book"
1350,ARGUMENT,"that always served him as a Prayer Book,30 and from which he never was"
1351,ARGUMENT,"parted, either at home or on a journey. It was the Court Calendar;31 there"
1352,ARGUMENT,in order were written down cases which years ago the Apparitor had
1353,ARGUMENT,"proclaimed with his own voice, before the authorities, or of which he had"
1354,ARGUMENT,managed to learn later. To common men the Calendar seems a mere list of
1355,ARGUMENT,"names, but to the Apparitor it was a succession of magnificent pictures."
1356,ARGUMENT,"So he read and mused: Oginski and Wizgird, the Dominicans and Rymsza,"
1357,ARGUMENT,"Rymsza and Wysogierd, Radziwill and Wereszczaka, Giedrojc and Rodultowski,"
1358,ARGUMENT,"Obuchowicz and the Jewish commune, Juraha and Piotrowski, Maleski and"
1359,ARGUMENT,"Mickiewicz, and finally Count Horeszko and Soplica; and, as he read, he"
1360,ARGUMENT,"called forth from these names the memory of mighty cases, and all the"
1361,ARGUMENT,"events of the trial; and before his eyes stand the court, plaintiff,"
1362,ARGUMENT,"defendant, and witnesses; and he beholds himself, how in a white smock and"
1363,ARGUMENT,"dark blue kontusz he stands before the tribunal, with one hand on his"
1364,ARGUMENT,"sabre and the other on the table, summoning the two parties. ""Silence!"" he"
1365,ARGUMENT,"calls. Thus dreaming and finishing his evening prayer, gradually the last"
1366,ARGUMENT,court apparitor in Lithuania fell asleep.
1367,ARGUMENT,
1368,ARGUMENT,Such were the amusements and disputes of those days in the quiet
1369,ARGUMENT,"Lithuanian village, while the rest of the world was swimming in tears and"
1370,ARGUMENT,"blood, and while that man, the god of war, surrounded by a cloud of"
1371,ARGUMENT,"regiments, armed with a thousand cannon, harnessing to his chariot golden"
1372,ARGUMENT,"eagles beside those of silver,32 was flying from the deserts of Libya to"
1373,ARGUMENT,"the lofty Alps, casting thunderbolt on thunderbolt, at the Pyramids, at"
1374,ARGUMENT,"Tabor, Marengo, Ulm, and Austerlitz. Victory and Conquest ran before and"
1375,ARGUMENT,"after him. The glory of so many exploits, heavy with the names of heroes,"
1376,ARGUMENT,"went roaring from the Nile to the North, until at the shores of the Niemen"
1377,ARGUMENT,it was beaten back as from crags by the Muscovite lines that defended
1378,ARGUMENT,Lithuania as with walls of iron against tidings terrible for Russia as the
1379,ARGUMENT,plague.
1380,ARGUMENT,
1381,ARGUMENT,"And yet now and then, like a stone from the sky, news came even to"
1382,ARGUMENT,"Lithuania; now and then an old man, lacking a hand or a foot, who was"
1383,ARGUMENT,"begging his bread, would stand and cast cautious eyes around, when he had"
1384,ARGUMENT,"received alms. If he saw no Russian soldiers in the yard, or Jewish caps,"
1385,ARGUMENT,"or red collars, then he would confess who he was: he was a member of the"
1386,ARGUMENT,"Polish legions, and was bringing back his old bones to that fatherland"
1387,ARGUMENT,which he could no longer defend. Then how all the family--how even the
1388,ARGUMENT,"servants embraced him, choking with tears! He would seat himself at the"
1389,ARGUMENT,board and tell of history more strange than fable; he would relate how
1390,ARGUMENT,General Dombrowski33 was making efforts to penetrate from the Italian land
1391,ARGUMENT,"into Poland, how he was gathering his countrymen on the plains of"
1392,ARGUMENT,"Lombardy; how Kniaziewicz34 was issuing commands from the Roman Capitol,"
1393,ARGUMENT,"and how, as a victor, he had cast in the eyes of the French an hundred"
1394,ARGUMENT,bloody standards torn from the descendants of the Cæsars; how
1395,ARGUMENT,Jablonowski35 had reached the land where the pepper grows and where sugar
1396,ARGUMENT,"is produced, and where in eternal spring bloom fragrant woods: with the"
1397,ARGUMENT,"legion of the Danube there the Polish general smites the negroes, but"
1398,ARGUMENT,sighs for his native soil.
1399,ARGUMENT,
1400,ARGUMENT,The words of the old man would spread secretly through the village; the
1401,ARGUMENT,"lad who heard them would vanish suddenly from home, would steal"
1402,ARGUMENT,"mysteriously through the forests and swamps, pursued by the Muscovites,"
1403,ARGUMENT,"would leap to hiding in the Niemen, and beneath its flood swim to the"
1404,ARGUMENT,"shore of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, where he would hear sweet words of"
1405,ARGUMENT,"greeting, ""Welcome, comrade!"" But before he departed, he would climb a"
1406,ARGUMENT,"stony hill and call to the Muscovites across the Niemen: ""Until we meet"
1407,ARGUMENT,"again!"" Thus there had stolen away Gorecki, Pac, and Obuchowicz;"
1408,ARGUMENT,"Piotrowski, Obolewski, Rozycki, Janowicz, the Mirzejewskis, Brochocki and"
1409,ARGUMENT,"the brothers Bernatowicz, Kupsc, Gedymin, and others whom I will not"
1410,ARGUMENT,"enumerate; they had abandoned their kinsmen and their beloved land, and"
1411,ARGUMENT,"their estates, which were seized for the Tsar's treasury."
1412,ARGUMENT,
1413,ARGUMENT,Sometimes there came to Lithuania a collector of alms from a foreign
1414,ARGUMENT,"convent, and after he became more closely acquainted with the lords of an"
1415,ARGUMENT,"estate, he would show them a gazette, which he cut out from his scapulary."
1416,ARGUMENT,In it would be set forth the number of soldiers and the names of all the
1417,ARGUMENT,leaders in every legion; with an account of the victory of each or of his
1418,ARGUMENT,"doom. After many years, a family would have news for the first time of the"
1419,ARGUMENT,"life, the glory, or the death of a son; the house would put on mourning,"
1420,ARGUMENT,but dared not tell for whom they mourned. The neighbours merely guessed
1421,ARGUMENT,"the news, and only the quiet grief of the gentry, or their quiet joy, was"
1422,ARGUMENT,the gazette of the peasants.
1423,ARGUMENT,
1424,ARGUMENT,Robak was probably just such a mysterious collector of alms; he often
1425,ARGUMENT,"conversed apart with the Judge, and always after these talks tidings of"
1426,ARGUMENT,some sort spread abroad in the neighbourhood. The bearing of the
1427,ARGUMENT,"Bernardine betrayed the fact that this monk had not always worn a cowl,"
1428,ARGUMENT,"and had not grown old within cloister walls. Over his right ear, somewhat"
1429,ARGUMENT,"above his temple, he had a scar as broad as one's palm, where the skin had"
1430,ARGUMENT,been sheared off; and on his chin was the recent trace of a lance or
1431,ARGUMENT,bullet; these wounds he had surely not received while reading the missal.
1432,ARGUMENT,"But not merely his grim glance and his scars, even his movements and his"
1433,ARGUMENT,voice had something soldierlike about them.
1434,ARGUMENT,
1435,ARGUMENT,"At the Mass, when with uplifted arms he turned from the altar to the"
1436,ARGUMENT,"people, in order to pronounce, ""The Lord be with you,"" he often turned as"
1437,ARGUMENT,skilfully--with a single movement--as if he were executing a
1438,ARGUMENT,right-about-face at the command of his captain; and he pronounced the
1439,ARGUMENT,words of the liturgy to the people in the same tone as an officer standing
1440,ARGUMENT,before a squadron: the boys who served him at the mass remarked this.
1441,ARGUMENT,Robak was also better versed in political affairs than in the lives of the
1442,ARGUMENT,saints; and when he was riding about gathering alms he often tarried in
1443,ARGUMENT,the district town. He had a multitude of interests: now he received
1444,ARGUMENT,"letters, which he never opened in the presence of strangers; now he sent"
1445,ARGUMENT,"off messengers, but whither and for what he did not say; often he stole"
1446,ARGUMENT,"out by night to the squires' mansions, and continually whispered with the"
1447,ARGUMENT,"gentry; he trudged through all the neighbouring villages, and in the"
1448,ARGUMENT,"taverns talked not a little with the village boors, and always of what was"
1449,ARGUMENT,"going on in foreign lands. Now he came to arouse the Judge, who had"
1450,ARGUMENT,already been an hour asleep; surely he had some tidings.

1469,ARGUMENT,"Who among us does not remember the years when, as a young lad, with his"
1470,ARGUMENT,"gun on his shoulder, he went whistling into the fields, where no rampart,"
1471,ARGUMENT,"no fence blocked his path; where, when you overstepped a boundary strip,"
1472,ARGUMENT,you did not recognise it as belonging to another! For in Lithuania a
1473,ARGUMENT,"hunter is like a ship upon the sea; wherever he will, and by whatever path"
1474,ARGUMENT,"he will, he roams far and wide! Like a prophet he gazes on the sky, where"
1475,ARGUMENT,in the clouds there are many signs that the hunter's eye can see; or like
1476,ARGUMENT,"an enchanter he talks with the earth, which, though deaf to city-dwellers,"
1477,ARGUMENT,whispers into his ear with a multitude of voices.
1478,ARGUMENT,
1479,ARGUMENT,"There a land rail calls from the meadow--it is vain to seek it, for it"
1480,ARGUMENT,flees away through the grass like a pike in the Niemen; there above your
1481,ARGUMENT,"head sounds the bell of early spring, the lark, hidden as deeply in the"
1482,ARGUMENT,"sky; there an eagle rustles with its broad wings through the airy heights,"
1483,ARGUMENT,"spreading terror among sparrows as a comet among stars; or a hawk, hanging"
1484,ARGUMENT,"beneath the clear blue vault, flutters its wings like a butterfly impaled"
1485,ARGUMENT,"on a pin, until, catching sight in the meadow of a bird or a hare, it"
1486,ARGUMENT,swoops upon it from on high like a falling star.
1487,ARGUMENT,
1488,ARGUMENT,"When will the Lord God permit us to return from our wanderings, and again"
1489,ARGUMENT,"to dwell upon our ancestral fields, and to serve in the cavalry that makes"
1490,ARGUMENT,"war on rabbits, or in the infantry that bears arms against birds; to know"
1491,ARGUMENT,"no other weapons than the scythe and the sickle, and no other gazettes"
1492,ARGUMENT,than the household accounts!
1493,ARGUMENT,
1494,ARGUMENT,"Over Soplicowo arose the sun, and it already fell on the thatched roofs,"
1495,ARGUMENT,"and through the chinks stole into the stable; and over the fresh,"
1496,ARGUMENT,"dark-green, fragrant hay of which the young men had made them a bed there"
1497,ARGUMENT,"streamed twinkling, golden bands from the openings of the black thatch,"
1498,ARGUMENT,like ribbons from a braid of hair; and the sun teased the faces of the
1499,ARGUMENT,"sleepers with its morning beams, like a village girl awakening her"
1500,ARGUMENT,sweetheart with an ear of wheat. Already the sparrows had begun to hop and
1501,ARGUMENT,"twitter beneath the thatch, already the gander had cackled thrice, and"
1502,ARGUMENT,"after it, as an echo, the ducks and turkeys resounded in chorus, and one"
1503,ARGUMENT,could hear the bellowing of the kine on their way to the fields.
1504,ARGUMENT,
1505,ARGUMENT,"The young men had arisen; Thaddeus still lay dozing, for he had gone to"
1506,ARGUMENT,sleep last of all. From the supper of the day before he had come back so
1507,ARGUMENT,"disquieted that at cockcrow he had not yet closed his eyes, and on his"
1508,ARGUMENT,couch he tossed about so violently that he sank into the hay as into
1509,ARGUMENT,water; at last he fell sound asleep. Finally a cool breeze blew in his
1510,ARGUMENT,"eyes, when the creaking doors of the stable were opened with a crash; and"
1511,ARGUMENT,"the Bernardine, Father Robak, came in with his belt of knotted cord,"
1512,ARGUMENT,"calling out, ""Surge, puer!"" and plying jocosely over his shoulders his"
1513,ARGUMENT,knotted belt.
1514,ARGUMENT,
1515,ARGUMENT,Already in the yard could be heard the cries of the hunters; horses were
1516,ARGUMENT,"being led forth, waggons were coming up; hardly could the yard contain"
1517,ARGUMENT,"such a throng. The horns sounded, they opened the kennels. The pack of"
1518,ARGUMENT,hounds rushing out whined joyfully; seeing the chargers of the huntsmen
1519,ARGUMENT,"and the leashes of their keepers, the dogs as if mad scampered about the"
1520,ARGUMENT,"enclosure, then ran and put their necks in the collars. All this foreboded"
1521,ARGUMENT,a very fine hunt; at last the Chamberlain gave the order to proceed.
1522,ARGUMENT,
1523,ARGUMENT,"The hunters started slowly, one after another, but beyond the gate they"
1524,ARGUMENT,spread out in a long line; in the middle of it rode side by side the
1525,ARGUMENT,"Assessor and the Notary, and though they occasionally cast a malicious"
1526,ARGUMENT,"glance at each other, they conversed in friendly fashion, like men of"
1527,ARGUMENT,"honour, who were on their way to settle a mortal quarrel; no one from"
1528,ARGUMENT,their words could have remarked their mutual hatred: the Notary led
1529,ARGUMENT,"Bobtail, the Assessor Falcon. The ladies in carriages brought up the rear;"
1530,ARGUMENT,"the young men, galloping alongside near the wheels, talked with the"
1531,ARGUMENT,ladies.
1532,ARGUMENT,
1533,ARGUMENT,"Father Robak walked with slow steps about the yard, finishing his morning"
1534,ARGUMENT,"prayers, but he glanced at Thaddeus, frowned, smiled, and finally motioned"
1535,ARGUMENT,"to him with his finger. When Thaddeus rode up, Robak with his finger on"
1536,ARGUMENT,his nose made him a threatening sign; but despite the requests and
1537,ARGUMENT,"entreaties of Thaddeus that he would explain to him clearly what he meant,"
1538,ARGUMENT,the Bernardine did not deign to answer or even to look at him again; he
1539,ARGUMENT,merely pulled his cowl over his face and finished his prayer: so Thaddeus
1540,ARGUMENT,rode off and joined the guests.
1541,ARGUMENT,
1542,ARGUMENT,Just at that instant the hunters were holding their leashes and all were
1543,ARGUMENT,standing motionless in their places; each gave a sign to the other to be
1544,ARGUMENT,"silent, and all had turned their eyes to a stone near which the Judge had"
1545,ARGUMENT,"halted: he had caught sight of the game, and was waving his arms in order"
1546,ARGUMENT,"to make his orders known. All understood him and stopped, and slowly"
1547,ARGUMENT,"across the field trotted the Assessor and the Notary; Thaddeus, being"
1548,ARGUMENT,"nearer, arrived before them, paused beside the Judge, and gazed at the"
1549,ARGUMENT,"spot to which he was pointing. It was long since he, had been in the"
1550,ARGUMENT,"field; on the grey expanse it was hard to distinguish the grey rabbit,"
1551,ARGUMENT,especially amid the stones. The Judge pointed him out; the poor hare was
1552,ARGUMENT,"crouched cowering beneath a stone, pricking up its ears; with a crimson"
1553,ARGUMENT,"eye it met the gaze of the hunters; as if bewitched, and conscious of its"
1554,ARGUMENT,"destiny, for very terror it could not turn its eye away from theirs, but"
1555,ARGUMENT,beneath the rock crouched dead as a rock. Meanwhile the dust in the field
1556,ARGUMENT,"came nearer and nearer, Bobtail was running in his leash and after him the"
1557,ARGUMENT,fleet Falcon; then the Assessor and the Notary shouted at once behind
1558,ARGUMENT,"them, ""At him,"" and vanished with the dogs in clouds of dust."
1559,ARGUMENT,
1560,ARGUMENT,"While they were thus pursuing the hare, the Count made his appearance near"
1561,ARGUMENT,the castle wood. All the neighbours knew that this gentleman could never
1562,ARGUMENT,"present himself at the appointed time; to-day also he had overslept, and"
1563,ARGUMENT,was therefore in a scolding humour with his servants. Seeing the hunters
1564,ARGUMENT,"in the field, he galloped towards them, with the skirts of his long white"
1565,ARGUMENT,"coat, of English cut, trailing in the wind. Behind him were mounted"
1566,ARGUMENT,"servants, wearing little black shiny caps like mushrooms, short jackets,"
1567,ARGUMENT,"striped boots, and white pantaloons; the servants whom the Count thus"
1568,ARGUMENT,"costumed, in his mansion were called  _jockeys_."
1569,ARGUMENT,
1570,ARGUMENT,"The galloping train was rushing towards the meadows, when the Count caught"
1571,ARGUMENT,sight of the castle and checked his horse. It was the first time that he
1572,ARGUMENT,"had seen the castle so early, and he could not believe that these were the"
1573,ARGUMENT,"same walls, so wonderful a freshness and beauty had the early morning"
1574,ARGUMENT,imparted to the outlines of the building. The Count marvelled at so new a
1575,ARGUMENT,"sight. The tower seemed to him twice as high, for it rose up above the"
1576,ARGUMENT,"early mist; the tin roof was gilded by the sun, and beneath it shone in"
1577,ARGUMENT,"the sashes fragments of the broken panes, breaking the eastern beams into"
1578,ARGUMENT,many-coloured rainbows; the lower stories were wrapped in a mantle of mist
1579,ARGUMENT,that hid from the eye the cracks and huge nicks. The cries of the distant
1580,ARGUMENT,"hunters, borne on the winds, echoed several times against the castle"
1581,ARGUMENT,"walls; you would have sworn that the cry came from the castle, that under"
1582,ARGUMENT,the curtain of fog the walls had been restored and were again inhabited.
1583,ARGUMENT,
1584,ARGUMENT,"The Count liked new and unwonted sights, and called them romantic; he used"
1585,ARGUMENT,"to say that he had a romantic head, but truth to say he was an out-and-out"
1586,ARGUMENT,crank. Sometimes when chasing a fox or a hare he would suddenly stop and
1587,ARGUMENT,"gaze mournfully at the sky, like a cat when it sees a sparrow on a tall"
1588,ARGUMENT,"pine; often he wandered through the wood without dog or gun, like a"
1589,ARGUMENT,"run-away recruit; often he sat by a brook motionless, inclining his head"
1590,ARGUMENT,"over a stream, like a heron that wants to consume all the fish with its"
1591,ARGUMENT,eye. Such were the queer habits of the Count; everybody said that there
1592,ARGUMENT,"was some screw loose in him. Yet they respected him, for he was a"
1593,ARGUMENT,"gentleman of ancient lineage, rich, kind to his peasants, and affable and"
1594,ARGUMENT,"friendly with his neighbours, even with the Jews."
1595,ARGUMENT,
1596,ARGUMENT,"The Count's horse, which he had turned off the road, trotted straight"
1597,ARGUMENT,"across the field to the threshold of the castle. The Count, left solitary,"
1598,ARGUMENT,"sighed, looked at the walls, took out paper and pencil, and began to draw."
1599,ARGUMENT,"Thereupon, looking to one side, he saw a dozen steps away a man who seemed"
1600,ARGUMENT,likewise a lover of the picturesque; with his head thrown back and his
1601,ARGUMENT,hands in his pockets he seemed to be counting the stones with his eyes.
1602,ARGUMENT,"The Count recognised him at once, but he had to call several times before"
1603,ARGUMENT,"Gerwazy heard his voice. He was a man of gentle birth, a servitor of the"
1604,ARGUMENT,"ancient lords of the castle, the last that remained of the Horeszkos'"
1605,ARGUMENT,"retainers; a tall grey-haired old man with a hale and rugged countenance,"
1606,ARGUMENT,"ploughed by wrinkles, gloomy and stem. Of old he had been famous among the"
1607,ARGUMENT,gentry for his jollity; but since the battle in which the owner of the
1608,ARGUMENT,"castle had perished, Gerwazy had changed, and now for many years he had"
1609,ARGUMENT,not gone to any fair or merry-making; since then no one had heard his
1610,ARGUMENT,witty jests or seen a smile upon his face. He always wore the ancient
1611,ARGUMENT,"livery of the Horeszkos, a long yellow coat with skirts, trimmed with lace"
1612,ARGUMENT,"that now was yellow, but once had doubtless been gilt; around its edge was"
1613,ARGUMENT,"embroidered in silk their coat of arms, the Half-Goat, and thence all the"
1614,ARGUMENT,neighbours had given the title of Half-Goat to the old gentleman.
1615,ARGUMENT,"Sometimes also, from a phrase that he incessantly repeated, they called"
1616,ARGUMENT,"him My-boy, sometimes Notchy, for his whole bald head was notched with"
1617,ARGUMENT,"scars. His real name was Rembajlo, but no one knew his coat of arms; he"
1618,ARGUMENT,"called himself the Warden, because years ago he had held that office in"
1619,ARGUMENT,"the castle. And he still wore a great bunch of keys at his girdle, on a"
1620,ARGUMENT,"band with a silver tassel, though he had nothing to open with them, for"
1621,ARGUMENT,the gates of the castle stood gaping wide. However he had found two
1622,ARGUMENT,"folding doors, which he had repaired and set up at his own expense, and he"
1623,ARGUMENT,amused himself daily with unlocking these doors. In one of the empty rooms
1624,ARGUMENT,he had chosen a habitation for himself; though he might have lived at the
1625,ARGUMENT,"Count's mansion on alms, he refused, for he pined away everywhere else,"
1626,ARGUMENT,and felt out of sorts unless he was breathing the air of the castle.
1627,ARGUMENT,
1628,ARGUMENT,"As soon as he caught sight of the Count, he snatched the cap from his"
1629,ARGUMENT,"head, and honoured with a bow the kinsman of his lords, inclining a great"
1630,ARGUMENT,"bald pate that shone from afar and was slashed with many a sabre, like a"
1631,ARGUMENT,"chopping-block. He stroked it with his hand, came up, and, once more"
1632,ARGUMENT,"bending low, said mournfully:--"
1633,ARGUMENT,
1634,ARGUMENT,"""My boy, young master--pardon me, that I speak thus to Your Excellency the"
1635,ARGUMENT,"Count; such is merely my custom, and it betokens no lack of respect. All"
1636,ARGUMENT,"the Horeszkos used to say 'My boy'; the last Pantler, my lord, was fond of"
1637,ARGUMENT,"the phrase. Is it true, my boy, that you grudge a penny for a lawsuit, and"
1638,ARGUMENT,"are yielding this castle to the Soplicas? I would not believe it, yet so"
1639,ARGUMENT,"they say all through the district."""
1640,ARGUMENT,
1641,ARGUMENT,Here he gazed at the castle and sighed incessantly.
1642,ARGUMENT,
1643,ARGUMENT,"""What is there strange in that?""  said the Count. ""The cost is great and"
1644,ARGUMENT,"the bother greater yet; I want to finish up, but the stupid old gentleman"
1645,ARGUMENT,is obstinate; he foresaw that he could tire me out. Indeed I cannot hold
1646,ARGUMENT,"out longer, and to-day I shall lay down arms and accept such conditions of"
1647,ARGUMENT,"agreement as the court may offer me."""
1648,ARGUMENT,
1649,ARGUMENT,"""Of agreement?"" cried Gerwazy, ""of agreement with the Soplicas? with the"
1650,ARGUMENT,"Soplicas, my boy?"" (So speaking he contorted his lips as though he were"
1651,ARGUMENT,"amazed at his own words.) ""Agreement with the Soplicas! My boy, young"
1652,ARGUMENT,"master, you are jesting, aren't you? The castle, the abode of the"
1653,ARGUMENT,"Horeszkos, pass into the hands of the Soplicas! Only deign to dismount"
1654,ARGUMENT,from the steed; let us go into the castle; just look it over a bit! You do
1655,ARGUMENT,"not know yourself what you are doing; do not refuse; dismount!"" And he"
1656,ARGUMENT,held the stirrup for him to dismount.
1657,ARGUMENT,
1658,ARGUMENT,They entered the castle; Gerwazy stopped at the threshold of the hall:--
1659,ARGUMENT,
1660,ARGUMENT,"""Here,"" he said, ""the ancient lords, surrounded by their retinue, used"
1661,ARGUMENT,"often to sit in their chairs, after they had dined. The lord settled the"
1662,ARGUMENT,"disputes of the peasants, or good humouredly told various curious stories"
1663,ARGUMENT,"to his guests, or found amusement in their tales and jests. But in the"
1664,ARGUMENT,courtyard the young men fought with staves or broke in the master's
1665,ARGUMENT,"Turkish ponies."""
1666,ARGUMENT,
1667,ARGUMENT,"They entered the hall.--""In this immense paved hall,"" said Gerwazy, ""you"
1668,ARGUMENT,cannot find as many stones as tuns of wine have been broached here in the
1669,ARGUMENT,"good old times. The gentry, when invited to a diet, a district assembly, a"
1670,ARGUMENT,"family holiday, or a hunting party, would pull the casks from the wine"
1671,ARGUMENT,cellar on their girdles. During the banquet an orchestra was stationed in
1672,ARGUMENT,that gallery and played the organ36 and various other instruments; and
1673,ARGUMENT,when they proposed a health the trumpets thundered in chorus; the vivats
1674,ARGUMENT,"followed in orderly succession, the first to the health of His Majesty the"
1675,ARGUMENT,"King, then to the Primate,37 then to Her Majesty the Queen, then to the"
1676,ARGUMENT,"Gentry and the whole Republic. But finally, after the fifth glass had been"
1677,ARGUMENT,"drunk, they always proposed, 'Let us love one another!' a toast unceasing,"
1678,ARGUMENT,"which, proclaimed while daylight still lingered, thundered on till dawn,"
1679,ARGUMENT,"when horses and waggons stood ready to carry each guest to his lodging."""
1680,ARGUMENT,
1681,ARGUMENT,They passed through several rooms; Gerwazy in silence now fixed his gaze
1682,ARGUMENT,"on the wall and now on the vaulted ceiling, recalling now a sad and now a"
1683,ARGUMENT,"pleasant memory; sometimes, as though he would say, ""All is over,"" he"
1684,ARGUMENT,bowed his head in sorrow; sometimes he waved his hand--evidently even
1685,ARGUMENT,recollection was a torture to him and he wished to drive it off. Finally
1686,ARGUMENT,"they paused, in a large room on the upper story, once set with mirrors;"
1687,ARGUMENT,to-day the mirrors had been removed and the frames stood empty; the sashes
1688,ARGUMENT,lacked their panes; directly opposite the door was a balcony. Going out on
1689,ARGUMENT,"it, the old man bowed his head in thought, and buried his face in his"
1690,ARGUMENT,hands; when he uncovered it it wore an expression of great sadness and
1691,ARGUMENT,"despair. The Count, though he did not know what all this meant, when he"
1692,ARGUMENT,"looked at the face of the old man felt a certain emotion, and pressed his"
1693,ARGUMENT,"hand. The silence lasted for a moment; then the old man broke it, shaking"
1694,ARGUMENT,his uplifted right hand:--
1695,ARGUMENT,
1696,ARGUMENT,"""There can be no agreement, my boy, between the Soplica and the blood of"
1697,ARGUMENT,the Horeszkos; in you flows the blood of the Horeszkos; you are a kinsman
1698,ARGUMENT,"of the Pantler by your mother the Mistress of the Hunt, whose mother was"
1699,ARGUMENT,"the child of the second daughter of the Castellan,38 who was, as is well"
1700,ARGUMENT,"known, the maternal uncle of my lord. Now listen to a story of your own"
1701,ARGUMENT,"family, which took place in this very room and no other."
1702,ARGUMENT,
1703,ARGUMENT,"""My late lord the Pantler, the first gentleman of the district, a rich man"
1704,ARGUMENT,"and of noted family, had but one child, a daughter beautiful as an angel;"
1705,ARGUMENT,so not a few of the gentry and the young notables paid their court to the
1706,ARGUMENT,"Pantler's daughter. Among the gentry there was one great roistering blade,"
1707,ARGUMENT,"a fighting bully, Jacek Soplica, who was called in jest the Wojewoda; in"
1708,ARGUMENT,"truth he was of great influence in the wojewodeship, for he had absolute"
1709,ARGUMENT,authority over the whole family of the Soplicas and controlled their three
1710,ARGUMENT,"hundred votes according to his will, although he himself possessed nothing"
1711,ARGUMENT,"except a little plot of ground, a sabre, and great mustaches that"
1712,ARGUMENT,stretched from ear to ear. So the Pantler often invited this ruffian to
1713,ARGUMENT,"his place and entertained him there, especially at the time of the"
1714,ARGUMENT,"district diets, in order to make himself popular among the fellow's"
1715,ARGUMENT,kinsmen and partisans. The mustachioed champion was so much elated by his
1716,ARGUMENT,courteous reception that he took it into his head that he might become his
1717,ARGUMENT,"host's son-in-law. He came to the castle more and more frequently, even"
1718,ARGUMENT,"when uninvited, and finally settled down among us as if in his own home,"
1719,ARGUMENT,and it seemed that he was on the point of declaring himself; but they
1720,ARGUMENT,"remarked this, and served him at the table with black soup.39 It may very"
1721,ARGUMENT,"well be that the Pantler's daughter had taken a fancy to the Soplica, but"
1722,ARGUMENT,that she kept it a deep secret from her parents.
1723,ARGUMENT,
1724,ARGUMENT,"""Those were the times of Kosciuszko; my lord supported the Constitution of"
1725,ARGUMENT,"the Third of May,40 and was already gathering the gentry in order to go to"
1726,ARGUMENT,"the aid of the Confederates, when suddenly the Muscovites encircled the"
1727,ARGUMENT,castle by night; there was barely time to fire an alarm signal from the
1728,ARGUMENT,"mortar, and to close the gates below and fasten them with a bar. There was"
1729,ARGUMENT,"no one in the whole castle except the Pantler, myself, and the lady; the"
1730,ARGUMENT,"cook and two turnspits, all three drunk; the parish priest, a servingman,"
1731,ARGUMENT,"and four footmen, all bold fellows. So to arms and to the windows! Here a"
1732,ARGUMENT,"throng of Muscovites came streaming across the terrace to the door,"
1733,ARGUMENT,"shouting 'Hurrah!' But we met them with bullets from ten guns, 'Back with"
1734,ARGUMENT,you!' Nothing could be seen; the servants shot without cessation from the
1735,ARGUMENT,"lower stories, and my lord and I from the balcony. All went finely,"
1736,ARGUMENT,although amid such great alarm. Twenty guns lay here on this floor; we
1737,ARGUMENT,shot one and they handed us another; the parish priest attended diligently
1738,ARGUMENT,"to this task, and the lady and her daughter, and the serving maids: there"
1739,ARGUMENT,"were but three marksmen, yet the fire was unceasing. The Muscovite boors"
1740,ARGUMENT,showered on us a hail of bullets from below; we replied from above
1741,ARGUMENT,"sparsely, but with better aim. Three times that rabble pressed up to the"
1742,ARGUMENT,"door, but each time three of them bit the dust: so they fled behind the"
1743,ARGUMENT,storehouse. It was already early dawn; with a cheerful face the Pantler
1744,ARGUMENT,"came out on the balcony with his gun, and whenever a Muscovite thrust"
1745,ARGUMENT,forth his brow from behind the storehouse he at once fired--and he never
1746,ARGUMENT,missed; each time a black helmet fell on the grass; so that at length
1747,ARGUMENT,"scarcely a man crept out from behind the wall. The Pantler, seeing his"
1748,ARGUMENT,"enemies in confusion, thought of making a sally; he seized his sabre, and,"
1749,ARGUMENT,"shouting from the balcony, gave orders to the servants; turning to me he"
1750,ARGUMENT,"said: 'Follow me, Gerwazy!' At that instant there was a shot from behind"
1751,ARGUMENT,"the gate; the Pantler's speech faltered, he turned red, turned pale, tried"
1752,ARGUMENT,"to speak, spat blood. Then I perceived that he had received the bullet"
1753,ARGUMENT,"full in the breast; my lord, tottering, pointed towards the gate. I"
1754,ARGUMENT,"recognised that villain Soplica, I recognised him! by his stature and by"
1755,ARGUMENT,his mustaches I By his shot the Pantler had perished; I saw it! The
1756,ARGUMENT,villain still held his gun raised aloft; smoke still came from the barrel!
1757,ARGUMENT,"I sighted at him; the brigand stood as if petrified! Twice I fired, and"
1758,ARGUMENT,"both shots missed; whether from hatred or from grief, I aimed ill. I heard"
1759,ARGUMENT,"the shrieks of women; I looked around--my lord was no longer living."""
1760,ARGUMENT,
1761,ARGUMENT,Here Gerwazy paused and burst into a flood of tears; then he concluded:--
1762,ARGUMENT,
1763,ARGUMENT,"""The Muscovites had already broken down the door, for after the death of"
1764,ARGUMENT,the Pantler I stood helpless and did not know what was going on around me.
1765,ARGUMENT,"Luckily to our help came Parafianowicz, bringing from Horbatowicze two"
1766,ARGUMENT,"hundred of the Mickiewiczes, who are a numerous and a valiant family of"
1767,ARGUMENT,"gentry, every man of them, and nourish an immemorial hatred of the"
1768,ARGUMENT,Soplicas.
1769,ARGUMENT,
1770,ARGUMENT,"""Thus perished a powerful, pious, and just lord, whose ancestors had held"
1771,ARGUMENT,"seats in the Senate, worn badges of honour, and carried the hetman's staff"
1772,ARGUMENT,"of office; a father to his peasants, a brother to the gentry--and he had no"
1773,ARGUMENT,son left after him to vow vengeance on his grave! But he had faithful
1774,ARGUMENT,"servants; with the blood of his wound I wet my broadsword, called the"
1775,ARGUMENT,"penknife--you have surely heard of my penknife, famous at every diet,"
1776,ARGUMENT,"market, and village assembly--and swore to notch it on the shoulders of the"
1777,ARGUMENT,"Soplicas. I pursued them at diets, forays, and fairs; two I hewed down in"
1778,ARGUMENT,"a brawl, two others in a duel; one I burnt in a wooden building, when with"
1779,ARGUMENT,Rymsza we sacked Korelicze--he was baked like a mudfish; but those whose
1780,ARGUMENT,ears I have cut off I cannot count. One only is left who has not yet
1781,ARGUMENT,received a reminder from me! He is the own dear brother of that
1782,ARGUMENT,"mustachioed bully; he still lives, and boasts of his wealth; the edge of"
1783,ARGUMENT,his field borders on the Horeszkos' castle; he is respected in the
1784,ARGUMENT,"district, he has an office, he is a judge! And you will yield the castle"
1785,ARGUMENT,to him? Shall his base feet wipe the blood of my lord from this floor? No!
1786,ARGUMENT,"While Gerwazy has but a pennyworth of spirit, and enough strength to move"
1787,ARGUMENT,"even with one little finger his penknife, which still hangs on the wall,"
1788,ARGUMENT,"never shall a Soplica get this castle!"""
1789,ARGUMENT,
1790,ARGUMENT,"""O!"" cried the Count, raising his hands on high, ""I had a fair foreboding"
1791,ARGUMENT,"that I loved these walls, though I knew not that they contained such"
1792,ARGUMENT,"treasures, so many dramatic memories, and so many tales! When once I seize"
1793,ARGUMENT,"from the Soplicas the castle of my ancestors, I will establish you within"
1794,ARGUMENT,"its walls as my burgrave: your tale, Gerwazy, has mightily affected me. I"
1795,ARGUMENT,regret that you did not lead me here at the hour of midnight; draped in my
1796,ARGUMENT,cloak I should have sat upon the ruins and you would have told me of
1797,ARGUMENT,bloody deeds. I regret that you have no great gift of narration! Often
1798,ARGUMENT,have I heard and often do I read such traditions; in England and Scotland
1799,ARGUMENT,"every lord's castle, in Germany every count's mansion was the theatre of"
1800,ARGUMENT,"murders! In every ancient, noble, powerful family there is a report of"
1801,ARGUMENT,"some bloody or treacherous deed, after which vengeance descends as an"
1802,ARGUMENT,inheritance to the heirs: in Poland for the first time do I hear of such
1803,ARGUMENT,"an incident. I feel that in me flows the blood of the manly Horeszkos, I"
1804,ARGUMENT,know what I owe to glory and to my family. So be it I I must break off all
1805,ARGUMENT,"negotiations with the Soplica, even though it should come to pistols or to"
1806,ARGUMENT,"the sword! Honour bids me!"""
1807,ARGUMENT,
1808,ARGUMENT,"He spoke, and moved on with solemn steps, and Gerwazy followed in deep"
1809,ARGUMENT,"silence. Before the gate the Count stopped, mumbling to himself; gazing at"
1810,ARGUMENT,"the castle he quickly mounted his horse, and thus in distraction he"
1811,ARGUMENT,concluded his monologue:--
1812,ARGUMENT,
1813,ARGUMENT,"""I regret that this old Soplica has no wife, or fair daughter whose charms"
1814,ARGUMENT,I might adore! If I loved her and could not obtain her hand a new
1815,ARGUMENT,"complication would arise in the tale; here the heart, there duty! here"
1816,ARGUMENT,"vengeance, there love!"""
1817,ARGUMENT,
1818,ARGUMENT,"So whispering he applied the spurs, and the horse flew towards the Judge's"
1819,ARGUMENT,"mansion, just as the hunters came riding out of the wood from the other"
1820,ARGUMENT,direction. The Count was fond of hunting: hardly had he perceived the
1821,ARGUMENT,"riders, when, forgetting everything, he galloped straight towards them,"
1822,ARGUMENT,"passing by the yard gate, the orchard, and the fences; but at a turn of"
1823,ARGUMENT,the path he looked around and checked his horse near the fence--it was the
1824,ARGUMENT,kitchen garden. Fruit trees planted in rows shaded a broad field; beneath
1825,ARGUMENT,"them were the vegetable beds. Here sat a cabbage, which bowed its"
1826,ARGUMENT,"venerable bald head, and seemed to meditate on the fate of vegetables;"
1827,ARGUMENT,"there, intertwining its pods with the green tresses of a carrot, a slender"
1828,ARGUMENT,bean turned upon it a thousand eyes; here the maize lifted its golden
1829,ARGUMENT,tassels; here and there could be seen the belly of a fat watermelon that
1830,ARGUMENT,"had rolled far from its parent stalk into a distant land, as a guest among"
1831,ARGUMENT,the crimson beets.
1832,ARGUMENT,
1833,ARGUMENT,"The beds were intersected by furrows; in each trench there stood, as if on"
1834,ARGUMENT,"guard, ranks of hemp stalks, the cypresses of the vegetable garden, calm,"
1835,ARGUMENT,"straight, and green; their leaves and their scent served to defend the"
1836,ARGUMENT,"beds, for through their leaves no serpent dares to press, and their scent"
1837,ARGUMENT,kills insects and caterpillars. Farther away towered up the whitish stalks
1838,ARGUMENT,"of poppies; on them you might think a flock of butterflies had perched,"
1839,ARGUMENT,"fluttering their wings, on which flashed, with all the colours of the"
1840,ARGUMENT,"rainbow, the gleam of precious stones; with so many different, living"
1841,ARGUMENT,"tints did the poppies allure the eye. Amid the flowers, like the full moon"
1842,ARGUMENT,"amid the stars, a round sunflower, with a great, glowing face, turned"
1843,ARGUMENT,after the sun from the east to the west.
1844,ARGUMENT,
1845,ARGUMENT,"Beside the fence stretched long, narrow, rounded hillocks, free from"
1846,ARGUMENT,"trees, bushes, and flowers: this was the cucumber patch. They had grown"
1847,ARGUMENT,"finely; with their great, spreading leaves they covered the beds as with a"
1848,ARGUMENT,"wrinkled carpet. Amid them walked a girl, dressed in white, sinking up to"
1849,ARGUMENT,her knees in the May greenery; stepping down from the beds into the
1850,ARGUMENT,"furrows, she seemed not to walk but to swim over the leaves and to bathe"
1851,ARGUMENT,"in their bright colour. Her head was shaded with a straw hat, from her"
1852,ARGUMENT,"brow there waved two pink ribbons and some tresses of bright, loose hair;"
1853,ARGUMENT,"in her hands she held a basket, and her eyes were lowered; her right hand"
1854,ARGUMENT,was raised as if to pluck something: as a little girl when bathing tries
1855,ARGUMENT,"to catch the fishes that sport with her tiny feet, so she at every instant"
1856,ARGUMENT,bent down with her hands and her basket to gather the cucumbers against
1857,ARGUMENT,"which she brushed with her foot, or of which her eye caught sight."
1858,ARGUMENT,
1859,ARGUMENT,"The Count, struck with so marvellous a sight, stood still. Hearing from"
1860,ARGUMENT,"afar the trampling of his comrades, he motioned to them with his hand to"
1861,ARGUMENT,"stop their horses: they halted. He gazed with outstretched neck, like a"
1862,ARGUMENT,"long-billed crane that stands apart from the flock, on one leg, keeping"
1863,ARGUMENT,"guard with watchful eyes, and holding a stone in the other foot, in order"
1864,ARGUMENT,not to fall asleep.
1865,ARGUMENT,
1866,ARGUMENT,The Count was awakened by a pattering on his shoulders and brow; it was
1867,ARGUMENT,"the Bernardine, Father Robak, who held aloft in his hand the knotted cords"
1868,ARGUMENT,of his belt.
1869,ARGUMENT,
1870,ARGUMENT,"""Will you have cucumbers?"" he cried; ""Here they are!"" [So saying he showed"
1871,ARGUMENT,"him the knots on his belt, which were shaped like cucumbers.41] ""Look out"
1872,ARGUMENT,"for danger, in this garden patch there is no fruit for you; nothing will"
1873,ARGUMENT,"come of it!"""
1874,ARGUMENT,
1875,ARGUMENT,"Then he threatened him with his finger, adjusted his cowl, and departed;"
1876,ARGUMENT,"the Count tarried on the spot a moment more, cursing and yet laughing at"
1877,ARGUMENT,"this sudden hindrance. He glanced at die garden, but she was no longer in"
1878,ARGUMENT,the garden; only her pink ribbon and her white gown flashed through the
1879,ARGUMENT,"window. On the garden bed one could see the path by which she had flown,"
1880,ARGUMENT,"for the green leaves, spurned by her foot in her flight, raised themselves"
1881,ARGUMENT,"and trembled an instant before they became quiet, like water cut by the"
1882,ARGUMENT,"wings of a bird. Only on the place where she had been standing, her"
1883,ARGUMENT,"abandoned willow basket, empty and overturned, was still poised upon the"
1884,ARGUMENT,leaves and tossing amid the green waves.
1885,ARGUMENT,
1886,ARGUMENT,An instant later all was silent and deserted; the Count fixed his eyes on
1887,ARGUMENT,"the house and strained his ears; still he mused, and still the huntsmen"
1888,ARGUMENT,stood motionless behind him.--Then in the quiet deserted house arose first
1889,ARGUMENT,"a murmur, then an uproar and merry cries, as in an empty hive when bees"
1890,ARGUMENT,fly back into it: that was a sign that the guests had returned from
1891,ARGUMENT,"hunting, and that the servants were busying themselves with breakfast."
1892,ARGUMENT,
1893,ARGUMENT,Through all the rooms there reigned a mighty bustle; they were carrying
1894,ARGUMENT,"about platters, plates of food and bottles; the men, just as they had come"
1895,ARGUMENT,"in, in their green suits, walked about the rooms with plates and glasses,"
1896,ARGUMENT,"and ate and drank; or, leaning against the window casements, they talked"
1897,ARGUMENT,"of guns, hounds, and hares. The Chamberlain and his family and the Judge"
1898,ARGUMENT,were seated at the table; in a corner the young ladies whispered together;
1899,ARGUMENT,there was no such order as is observed at dinners and suppers. In this
1900,ARGUMENT,old-fashioned Polish household this was a new custom; at breakfasts the
1901,ARGUMENT,"Judge, though loth, permitted such disorder, but he did not commend it."
1902,ARGUMENT,
1903,ARGUMENT,There were likewise different dishes for the ladies and for the gentlemen.
1904,ARGUMENT,"Here they carried around trays with an entire coffee service, immense"
1905,ARGUMENT,"trays, charmingly painted with flowers, and on them fragrant, smoking tin"
1906,ARGUMENT,"pots, and golden cups of Dresden china, and with each cup a tiny little"
1907,ARGUMENT,jug of cream. In no other country is there such coffee as in Poland. In
1908,ARGUMENT,"Poland, in a respectable household, a special woman is, by ancient custom,"
1909,ARGUMENT,charged with the preparation of coffee. She is called the coffee-maker;
1910,ARGUMENT,"she brings from the city, or gets from the river barges,42 berries of the"
1911,ARGUMENT,"finest sort, and she knows secret ways of preparing the drink, which is"
1912,ARGUMENT,"black as coal, transparent as amber, fragrant as mocha, and thick as"
1913,ARGUMENT,honey. Everybody knows how necessary for coffee is good cream: in the
1914,ARGUMENT,"country this is not hard to get; for the coffee-maker, early in the day,"
1915,ARGUMENT,"after setting her pots on the fire, visits the dairy, and with her own"
1916,ARGUMENT,hands lightly skims the fresh flower of the milk into a separate little
1917,ARGUMENT,"jug for each cup, that each of them may be dressed in its separate little"
1918,ARGUMENT,cap.
1919,ARGUMENT,
1920,ARGUMENT,The older ladies had risen earlier and had already drunk their coffee; now
1921,ARGUMENT,"they had had made for them a second dish, of warm beer, whitened with"
1922,ARGUMENT,"cream, in which swam curds cut into little bits."
1923,ARGUMENT,
1924,ARGUMENT,"The gentlemen had their choice of smoked meats; fat half-geese, hams, and"
1925,ARGUMENT,"slices of tongue--all choice, all cured in home fashion in the chimney with"
1926,ARGUMENT,juniper smoke. Finally they brought in stewed beef with gravy43 as the
1927,ARGUMENT,last course: such was breakfast in the Judge's house.
1928,ARGUMENT,
1929,ARGUMENT,"In adjoining rooms two separate companies had gathered. The older people,"
1930,ARGUMENT,"grouped about a small table, talked of new ways of farming, and of the new"
1931,ARGUMENT,"imperial edicts, which were growing more and more severe. The Chamberlain"
1932,ARGUMENT,discussed the current rumours of war and based on them conclusions as to
1933,ARGUMENT,"politics. The Seneschal's daughter, putting on blue spectacles, amused the"
1934,ARGUMENT,Chamberlain's wife by telling fortunes with cards. In the other room the
1935,ARGUMENT,younger men talked over the hunt in a more calm and quiet fashion than was
1936,ARGUMENT,"usually the case; for the Assessor and the Notary, both mighty orators,"
1937,ARGUMENT,"the foremost experts on the chase and the best huntsmen, sat opposite each"
1938,ARGUMENT,"other glum and angry. Both had set on their hounds well, both had felt"
1939,ARGUMENT,"certain of victory, when in the middle of the field there turned up a"
1940,ARGUMENT,patch of unreaped spring corn belonging to a peasant. Into this the hare
1941,ARGUMENT,"fled; Bobtail and Falcon were each about to seize it, when the Judge"
1942,ARGUMENT,"checked the horsemen at the border of the field; they had to obey,"
1943,ARGUMENT,"although in great wrath. The dogs returned without their prey, and no one"
1944,ARGUMENT,knew for sure whether the beast had escaped or had been caught; no one
1945,ARGUMENT,"could guess whether it had fallen into the clutches of Bobtail, or of"
1946,ARGUMENT,"Falcon, or of both at once. The two sides held different opinions, and the"
1947,ARGUMENT,settlement of the quarrel was postponed to the future.
1948,ARGUMENT,
1949,ARGUMENT,"The old Seneschal passed from room to room, glancing absentmindedly about"
1950,ARGUMENT,him; he mixed neither in the talk of the hunters nor in that of the old
1951,ARGUMENT,"men, and evidently had something else on his mind. He carried a leather"
1952,ARGUMENT,"flapper; sometimes he would stop, meditate long, and--kill a fly on the"
1953,ARGUMENT,wall.
1954,ARGUMENT,
1955,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus and Telimena, standing on the threshold in the doorway between"
1956,ARGUMENT,"the rooms, were talking together; no great distance divided them from"
1957,ARGUMENT,"hearers, so they whispered. Thaddeus now learned that Aunt Telimena was a"
1958,ARGUMENT,"rich lady, that they were not so near of kin as to be separated by the"
1959,ARGUMENT,canons of the Church; that it was not even certain that Aunt Telimena was
1960,ARGUMENT,"any blood relation of her nephew, although his uncle called her sister,"
1961,ARGUMENT,because their common kindred had once so styled them despite the
1962,ARGUMENT,"difference of their years; that later, during her long residence in the"
1963,ARGUMENT,"capital, she had rendered inestimable services to the Judge; for which"
1964,ARGUMENT,"reason the Judge greatly respected her, and in society liked, perhaps as a"
1965,ARGUMENT,"mere whim, to call himself her brother, which Telimena, for friendship's"
1966,ARGUMENT,"sake, did not forbid him. These confessions lightened the heart of"
1967,ARGUMENT,Thaddeus. They also informed each other of other things; and all this
1968,ARGUMENT,"happened in one short, brief moment."
1969,ARGUMENT,
1970,ARGUMENT,"But in the room to the right, tempting the Assessor, the Notary casually"
1971,ARGUMENT,remarked:--
1972,ARGUMENT,
1973,ARGUMENT,"""I said yesterday that our hunting party could not succeed; it is still"
1974,ARGUMENT,"too early, the grain is still in the ear, and there are many strips of"
1975,ARGUMENT,"unreaped spring corn, belonging to the peasants. For this reason the Count"
1976,ARGUMENT,"did not come, despite our invitation. The Count has an excellent knowledge"
1977,ARGUMENT,of the chase; he has often discoursed of the proper time and places for
1978,ARGUMENT,"hunting. The Count from childhood up has dwelt in foreign parts, and he"
1979,ARGUMENT,"says that it is a mark of barbarism to hunt, as we do, with no regard to"
1980,ARGUMENT,"laws, ordinances, and government regulations; to ride over another man's"
1981,ARGUMENT,"estate without the knowledge of the owner, without respecting any man's"
1982,ARGUMENT,landmarks or boundaries; to course the fields and woods in spring as well
1983,ARGUMENT,"as in summer; sometimes to kill a fox just when it is moulting, or to"
1984,ARGUMENT,"allow the hounds to run down a pregnant hare in the winter corn, or rather"
1985,ARGUMENT,"to torture it, with great damage to the game. Hence the Count admits with"
1986,ARGUMENT,"regret that civilisation is on a higher plane among the Muscovites, for"
1987,ARGUMENT,"there they have ukases of the Tsar on hunting, and police supervision, and"
1988,ARGUMENT,"punishment for offenders."""
1989,ARGUMENT,
1990,ARGUMENT,"""As I love my mother,"" said Telimena, turning to the left-hand room and"
1991,ARGUMENT,"fanning her shoulders with a small batiste handkerchief; ""the Count is not"
1992,ARGUMENT,mistaken; I know Russia well. You people would not believe me when I used
1993,ARGUMENT,to tell you in how many respects the watchfulness and strictness of that
1994,ARGUMENT,"government are worthy of praise, I have been in St. Petersburg more than"
1995,ARGUMENT,once or twice! Tender memories I charming images of the past! What a city!
1996,ARGUMENT,Have none of you been in St. Petersburg? Perhaps you would like to see a
1997,ARGUMENT,map of it; I have a map of the city in my desk. In summer St. Petersburg
1998,ARGUMENT,"society usually lives in  _dachas_, that is, in rural palaces (_dacha_"
1999,ARGUMENT,"means cottage). I lived in a little palace, just above the river Neva, not"
2000,ARGUMENT,"too near the city, and not too far from it, on a small artificial hill."
2001,ARGUMENT,"Ah, what a cottage that was! I still have the plan in my desk. Now to my"
2002,ARGUMENT,"misfortune a certain petty official, who was serving on an inquest, hired"
2003,ARGUMENT,"a house near by. He kept several hounds; what torture, when a petty"
2004,ARGUMENT,official and a kennel live close by! Whenever I went out into the garden
2005,ARGUMENT,with a book to enjoy the light of the moon and the coolness of the
2006,ARGUMENT,"evening, immediately a dog would rush up and wag its tail and prick up its"
2007,ARGUMENT,ears as if it were mad. I was often terrified. My heart foreboded some
2008,ARGUMENT,"misfortune from those dogs, and so it came to pass: for when I went into"
2009,ARGUMENT,"the garden on a certain morning, a hound throttled at my feet my beloved"
2010,ARGUMENT,"little King Charles spaniel! Ah, he was a lovely little dog; Prince"
2011,ARGUMENT,"Sukin44 gave him to me as a present to remember him by--clever, and lively"
2012,ARGUMENT,"as a squirrel; I have his portrait, only I don't want to go to my desk"
2013,ARGUMENT,"now. Seeing it strangled, owing to my great distress I had a fainting"
2014,ARGUMENT,"spell, spasms, palpitation of the heart; perhaps my health might have"
2015,ARGUMENT,"suffered even more severely. Luckily, just then there rode up on a visit"
2016,ARGUMENT,"Kirilo Gavrilich Kozodusin,45 the Master of the Hunt of the Court, who"
2017,ARGUMENT,inquired the cause of so serious an attack. He had the police sergeant
2018,ARGUMENT,"pulled in by the ears; the man stood there pale, trembling, and scarcely"
2019,ARGUMENT,"alive. 'How dare you,' shouted Kirilo with a voice of thunder, 'course in"
2020,ARGUMENT,"spring a pregnant doe, here under the nose of the Tsar?' The amazed"
2021,ARGUMENT,"sergeant in vain swore that he had not yet begun his hunting, and that"
2022,ARGUMENT,"with the august permission of the Master of the Hunt, the beast coursed"
2023,ARGUMENT,"seemed to him to be a dog and not a doe. 'What!' shouted Kirilo, 'do you"
2024,ARGUMENT,"dare, you scoundrel, to say that you have more knowledge of hunting and"
2025,ARGUMENT,"the varieties of beasts than I, Kozodusin, the Tsar's Jagermeister? The"
2026,ARGUMENT,"Chief of Police shall at once pass judgment between us,' They summoned the"
2027,ARGUMENT,"Chief of Police and told him to take down the evidence. 'I,' said"
2028,ARGUMENT,"Kozodusin, 'hereby testify that this is a doe; he impudently alleges that"
2029,ARGUMENT,"it is a domestic dog. Judge between us, which of us better understands"
2030,ARGUMENT,beasts and hunting.' The Chief of Police understood the duties of his
2031,ARGUMENT,"office, and was greatly amazed at the insolence of the sergeant; taking"
2032,ARGUMENT,him aside he gave him brotherly advice to plead guilty and thereby atone
2033,ARGUMENT,for his offence. The Master of the Hunt was mollified and promised that he
2034,ARGUMENT,would intercede with the Emperor and somewhat mitigate the sentence. The
2035,ARGUMENT,"matter ended by the dogs being sent to be strangled, and the sergeant to"
2036,ARGUMENT,prison for four weeks. This trifle amused us the whole evening; the next
2037,ARGUMENT,day the story spread abroad that the Master of the Hunt had taken up the
2038,ARGUMENT,"case of my little dog, and I even know for a fact that the Emperor himself"
2039,ARGUMENT,"laughed over it."""
2040,ARGUMENT,
2041,ARGUMENT,Laughter arose in both rooms. The Judge and the Bernardine were playing at
2042,ARGUMENT,"marriage; spades were trumps, and the Judge was just about to make an"
2043,ARGUMENT,"important play. The Monk could hardly breathe for excitement, when the"
2044,ARGUMENT,"Judge caught the beginning of the story, and was so interested in it that"
2045,ARGUMENT,"with head thrown back and card uplifted, ready to take the trick, he sat"
2046,ARGUMENT,"quiet and only alarmed the Bernardine, until, when the story was ended, he"
2047,ARGUMENT,"played his knave, and said with a laugh:--"
2048,ARGUMENT,
2049,ARGUMENT,"""Let whoever will praise the civilisation of the Germans, or the strict"
2050,ARGUMENT,discipline of the Muscovites; let the men of Great Poland46 learn from the
2051,ARGUMENT,"Suabians to go to law over a fox, and summon constables to arrest a hound"
2052,ARGUMENT,"that has ventured into another man's grove; in Lithuania, thank the Lord,"
2053,ARGUMENT,we keep up the old ways: we have enough game for ourselves and for our
2054,ARGUMENT,"neighbours, and shall never complain to the police about it; and we have"
2055,ARGUMENT,"enough grain, so that the dogs will not famish us by running through the"
2056,ARGUMENT,spring wheat or the rye; on the peasants' fields alone do I forbid
2057,ARGUMENT,"hunting."""
2058,ARGUMENT,
2059,ARGUMENT,"""It is no wonder, sir,"" called the Steward from the room at the left,"
2060,ARGUMENT,"""since you pay dear for such game. The peasants are glad of the chance;"
2061,ARGUMENT,"when a dog runs into their wheat, if he shakes out ten ears, then you"
2062,ARGUMENT,repay three score and are not content even with that; often the boors get
2063,ARGUMENT,"a thaler into the bargain. Believe me, sir, that the peasants will grow"
2064,ARGUMENT,"very insolent, if----"""
2065,ARGUMENT,
2066,ARGUMENT,"The rest of the Steward's argument the Judge could not hear, for between"
2067,ARGUMENT,"the two discourses there had begun a dozen conversations, jests, stories,"
2068,ARGUMENT,and even disputes.
2069,ARGUMENT,
2070,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus and Telimena had been forgotten by all the rest of the company,"
2071,ARGUMENT,and were absorbed in each other.--The lady was glad that her wit had amused
2072,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus so greatly; in return, the young man showered compliments on her."
2073,ARGUMENT,"Telimena spoke more and more slowly and softly, and Thaddeus pretended"
2074,ARGUMENT,"that he could not hear her in the buzz of voices; so, whispering, he drew"
2075,ARGUMENT,so near her that he felt on his face the pleasant warmth of her brow;
2076,ARGUMENT,"holding his breath, he caught her sighs with his lips, and with his eye he"
2077,ARGUMENT,followed every sparkle of her glance.
2078,ARGUMENT,
2079,ARGUMENT,Then between them there suddenly darted first a fly and after it the
2080,ARGUMENT,Seneschal's flapper.
2081,ARGUMENT,
2082,ARGUMENT,In Lithuania there are swarms of flies. Among them there is a special
2083,ARGUMENT,"variety, called ""gentry flies""; in colour and form they are quite like"
2084,ARGUMENT,"others, but they have a broader breast, a larger belly than the common"
2085,ARGUMENT,"sort; as they fly they hum loudly and buzz beyond all endurance, and they"
2086,ARGUMENT,are so strong that they will break right through a spider's web; or if one
2087,ARGUMENT,"is caught, it will buzz there for three days, for it can contend with the"
2088,ARGUMENT,"spider in single combat. All this the Seneschal had carefully observed,"
2089,ARGUMENT,"and he argued further that these gentry flies produce the smaller folk,"
2090,ARGUMENT,"corresponding among flies to the queen bee in a swarm, and that with their"
2091,ARGUMENT,"destruction the remnant of those insects would perish. To be sure, neither"
2092,ARGUMENT,the housekeeper nor the parish priest had ever believed these deductions
2093,ARGUMENT,"of the Seneschal, but held quite different views as to the nature of"
2094,ARGUMENT,"flies; the Seneschal, however, did not waver from his ancient habit;"
2095,ARGUMENT,whenever he caught sight of such a fly he immediately pursued it. Just at
2096,ARGUMENT,"that moment a ""gentleman"" trumpeted above his ear; twice the Seneschal"
2097,ARGUMENT,"swung at it, and to his amazement missed; a third time he swung at it, and"
2098,ARGUMENT,"almost knocked out a window. At last the fly, bewildered by such an"
2099,ARGUMENT,"uproar, seeing on the threshold two people that barred his retreat, threw"
2100,ARGUMENT,itself in desperation between their faces. Even there the right hand of
2101,ARGUMENT,the Seneschal darted in pursuit of it; the blow was so violent that the
2102,ARGUMENT,two heads sprang apart like the two halves of a tree torn asunder by a
2103,ARGUMENT,thunderbolt; both bumped against the doorposts so violently that they got
2104,ARGUMENT,black and blue spots.
2105,ARGUMENT,
2106,ARGUMENT,"Luckily no one noticed this, for the conversation, which hitherto had been"
2107,ARGUMENT,"lively and animated, but fairly orderly, ended in a sudden clamorous"
2108,ARGUMENT,"outburst. As, when foxhunters are entering a wood, one hears from time to"
2109,ARGUMENT,"time the crackling of trees, scattered shots, and the baying of the pack;"
2110,ARGUMENT,but then the master of the hounds unexpectedly starts the game; he gives
2111,ARGUMENT,"the signal, and a hubbub arises in the throng of huntsmen and dogs, as if"
2112,ARGUMENT,every tree of the thicket had found a voice: such is the case with
2113,ARGUMENT,"conversation--it moves on slowly, until it happens on a weighty topic, as"
2114,ARGUMENT,dogs on the game. The game of the hunters' talk was that furious dispute
2115,ARGUMENT,of the Notary and the Assessor over their famous hounds. It lasted only a
2116,ARGUMENT,"short time, but they accomplished much in a single instant, for in one"
2117,ARGUMENT,breath they hurled so many words and insults that they exhausted the usual
2118,ARGUMENT,"three-fourths of a dispute--taunts, anger, and challenge--and were already"
2119,ARGUMENT,getting ready to use their fists.
2120,ARGUMENT,
2121,ARGUMENT,"So all rushed towards them from the other room, and, pouring through the"
2122,ARGUMENT,"doorway like a swift wave, carried away the young couple who were standing"
2123,ARGUMENT,"on the threshold like Janus, the two-headed god."
2124,ARGUMENT,
2125,ARGUMENT,"Before Thaddeus and Telimena could smooth the hair on their heads, the"
2126,ARGUMENT,threatening shouts had died away; a murmur mixed with laughter was
2127,ARGUMENT,"spreading through the throng, a truce had come to the brawl; the Monk had"
2128,ARGUMENT,"appeased it--an old man, but strong and with very broad shoulders. Just as"
2129,ARGUMENT,"the Assessor had run up to the Jurist, and when the combatants were"
2130,ARGUMENT,"already making threatening gestures at each other, he suddenly seized them"
2131,ARGUMENT,"both by the collar from behind, and twice knocking their two heads"
2132,ARGUMENT,"violently together like Easter eggs, he spread out his arms like a"
2133,ARGUMENT,"signpost, and tossed them at the same moment into opposite corners of the"
2134,ARGUMENT,"room; for a moment he stood still with outstretched arms, and cried,"
2135,ARGUMENT,"""_Pax, pax, pax vobiscum_; peace be with you!"""
2136,ARGUMENT,
2137,ARGUMENT,Both factions were amazed and even began to laugh. Because of the respect
2138,ARGUMENT,"due to a cleric they did not dare to revile the Monk, and after such a"
2139,ARGUMENT,test no one had any desire to start a quarrel with him. And Father Robak
2140,ARGUMENT,soon calmed the assembly; it was evident that he had not sought any
2141,ARGUMENT,triumph; he did not further threaten the two brawlers or scold them; he
2142,ARGUMENT,"only adjusted his cowl, and, tucking his hands into his belt, quietly left"
2143,ARGUMENT,the room.
2144,ARGUMENT,
2145,ARGUMENT,Meanwhile the Chamberlain and the Judge had taken a stand between the two
2146,ARGUMENT,"factions. The Seneschal, as if aroused from deep thought, stepped into"
2147,ARGUMENT,their midst and ran his fiery eye over the assembly; wherever he still
2148,ARGUMENT,"heard a murmur, there he waved soothingly his leather flapper, as a priest"
2149,ARGUMENT,"his sprinkler; finally, raising impressively the handle of it on high,"
2150,ARGUMENT,"like a marshal's staff, he imposed silence."
2151,ARGUMENT,
2152,ARGUMENT,"""Hold your peace!"" he repeated, ""and bear in mind, you who are the"
2153,ARGUMENT,"foremost hunters in the district, what will come of a scandalous brawl."
2154,ARGUMENT,"Are you aware? These young men, in whom is the hope of our country, who"
2155,ARGUMENT,"are to bring fame to our groves and forests, who, alas! even now neglect"
2156,ARGUMENT,"the chase, may receive thereby a new impulse to despise it, if they see"
2157,ARGUMENT,"that those who should give examples to others, bring back from the chase"
2158,ARGUMENT,"only wrangling and quarrels. Have also due regard for my grey hairs, for I"
2159,ARGUMENT,"have known greater sportsmen than you, and I have often judged between"
2160,ARGUMENT,them as an arbitrator. In the Lithuanian forests who has been equal to
2161,ARGUMENT,"Rejtan, either in stationing a line of beaters, or in himself encountering"
2162,ARGUMENT,the beast? Who can compare himself with Jerzy Bialopiotrowicz? Where is
2163,ARGUMENT,"there such a marksman to-day as Zegota, who with a pistol shot could hit a"
2164,ARGUMENT,"rabbit on the run? I knew Terajewicz, who, when he went out for wild"
2165,ARGUMENT,"boars, took no other arms than a pike, and Budrewicz, who used to fight"
2166,ARGUMENT,singly against a bear! Such men did our forests once behold! If it came to
2167,ARGUMENT,"a dispute, how did they settle the dispute. Why, they chose judges and set"
2168,ARGUMENT,"up stakes. Oginski lost three thousand acres of woodland over a wolf, and"
2169,ARGUMENT,a badger cost Niesiolowski several villages! Now do you gentlemen follow
2170,ARGUMENT,"the example of your elders, and settle your dispute in this way, even"
2171,ARGUMENT,though you may set up a smaller stake. Words are wind; to wordy disputes
2172,ARGUMENT,there is no end; it is a shame to tire our ears longer with a brawl over a
2173,ARGUMENT,"rabbit: so do you first choose arbitrators; and, whatever their verdict"
2174,ARGUMENT,"may be, conscientiously abide by it. I will beg the Judge not to forbid"
2175,ARGUMENT,"the master of the hounds to lead the chase even across the wheat, and I"
2176,ARGUMENT,"hope that I shall obtain this favour from my lord."""
2177,ARGUMENT,
2178,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he embraced the knees of the Judge."
2179,ARGUMENT,
2180,ARGUMENT,"""A horse!"" shouted the Notary, ""I will stake a horse with his caparison;"
2181,ARGUMENT,"and I will further covenant before the local court, that I deposit this"
2182,ARGUMENT,"ring as a reward for our arbitrator, the Judge."""
2183,ARGUMENT,
2184,ARGUMENT,"""I,"" said the Assessor, ""will stake my golden dog-collars, covered with"
2185,ARGUMENT,"lizard-skin, with rings of gold, and my leash of woven silk, the"
2186,ARGUMENT,workmanship of which is as marvellous as the jewel that glitters upon it.
2187,ARGUMENT,"That outfit I wished to leave as an inheritance to my children, if I"
2188,ARGUMENT,"should marry; that outfit was given me by Prince Dominik Radziwill,47 when"
2189,ARGUMENT,once I hunted with him and with Prince Marshal Sanguszko and General
2190,ARGUMENT,"Mejen,48 and when I challenged them all to course their hounds with me."
2191,ARGUMENT,There--something unexampled in the history of the chase--I captured six
2192,ARGUMENT,hares with a single bitch. We were then hunting on the meadow of Kupisko;
2193,ARGUMENT,"Prince Radziwill could not keep his seat upon his horse, but, dismounting,"
2194,ARGUMENT,"embraced my famous hound Kania,49 and thrice kissed her on the head. And"
2195,ARGUMENT,"then, thrice patting her on the muzzle, he said, 'I dub thee hence-forward"
2196,ARGUMENT,Princess of Kupisko.' Thus does Napoleon give principalities to his
2197,ARGUMENT,"generals, from the places at which they have gained great victories."""
2198,ARGUMENT,
2199,ARGUMENT,"Telimena, wearied with the prolonged wrangling, wanted to go out into the"
2200,ARGUMENT,"fresh air, but sought a partner. She took a little basket from the peg."
2201,ARGUMENT,"""Gentlemen, I see that you wish to remain within doors,"" she said,"
2202,ARGUMENT,"wrapping around her head a red cashmere shawl, ""but I am going for"
2203,ARGUMENT,"mushrooms: follow me who will!"" Under one arm she took the little daughter"
2204,ARGUMENT,"of the Chamberlain, with the other she raised her skirt up to her ankles."
2205,ARGUMENT,Thaddeus silently hastened after her--to seek mushrooms!
2206,ARGUMENT,
2207,ARGUMENT,"The plan of a walking party was very welcome to the Judge, who saw in it a"
2208,ARGUMENT,means of settling a noisy dispute; so he called out:--
2209,ARGUMENT,
2210,ARGUMENT,"""Gentlemen, to the woods for mushrooms! The one who brings the finest to"
2211,ARGUMENT,the table I will seat beside the prettiest girl; I will pick her out
2212,ARGUMENT,"myself. If a lady finds it, she shall choose for herself the handsomest"
2213,ARGUMENT,"young man."""

2231,ARGUMENT,
2232,ARGUMENT,
2233,ARGUMENT,"The Count returned home, but he kept checking his horse, turning back his"
2234,ARGUMENT,"head, and gazing at the garden; and once it seemed to him that a"
2235,ARGUMENT,"mysterious, snow-white gown again flashed from the window; and that again"
2236,ARGUMENT,"something light fell from on high, and flitting across the garden in the"
2237,ARGUMENT,"twinkling of an eye, glittered among the green cucumbers, like a sunbeam"
2238,ARGUMENT,that steals out from a cloud and falls on a slab of flint in a ploughed
2239,ARGUMENT,"field, or on a small sheet of water in a green meadow."
2240,ARGUMENT,
2241,ARGUMENT,"The Count dismounted and sent his servants to the house, but himself set"
2242,ARGUMENT,"out secretly for the garden; soon he reached the fence, found an opening"
2243,ARGUMENT,"in it, and slunk in quietly, as a wolf into a sheepfold; unluckily he"
2244,ARGUMENT,jostled some dry gooseberry bushes. The little gardener glanced around as
2245,ARGUMENT,"though frightened by the rustling, but perceived nothing; however, she ran"
2246,ARGUMENT,"to the other side of the garden. But along the edge, among the great"
2247,ARGUMENT,"sorrel plants and amid the leaves of burdock, the Count, leaping like a"
2248,ARGUMENT,"frog over the grass, quietly crawled near on his hands and knees; he put"
2249,ARGUMENT,"out his head, and beheld a marvellous sight."
2250,ARGUMENT,
2251,ARGUMENT,In that part of the garden grew scattered cherry trees; among them grain
2252,ARGUMENT,"and vegetables, purposely of mixed varieties: wheat, maize, beans, bearded"
2253,ARGUMENT,"barley, millet, peas, and even bushes and flowers. The housekeeper had"
2254,ARGUMENT,devised such a garden for the poultry; she was famous for her skill--her
2255,ARGUMENT,"name was Mrs. Hennibiddy, born Miss Turkee. Her invention made an epoch in"
2256,ARGUMENT,"poultry-raising: to-day it is universally known, but in those times it was"
2257,ARGUMENT,still passed about as a novelty and received under the seal of secrecy by
2258,ARGUMENT,"only a few persons, until at last the almanac published it under the"
2259,ARGUMENT,"heading, _A cure for hawks and kites, or a new method of raising"
2260,ARGUMENT,poultry_--that meant this garden patch.
2261,ARGUMENT,
2262,ARGUMENT,"As soon as the cock that keeps watch stands still, and, throwing back and"
2263,ARGUMENT,"holding motionless his bill, and inclining to one side his head with its"
2264,ARGUMENT,"red comb, that he may the more easily aim at the heavens with his eye,"
2265,ARGUMENT,"perceives a hawk hanging beneath the clouds, he calls the alarm: at once"
2266,ARGUMENT,"the hens take refuge in this garden--even the geese and peacocks, and the"
2267,ARGUMENT,"doves in their sudden fright, if they have not time to hide beneath the"
2268,ARGUMENT,roof.
2269,ARGUMENT,
2270,ARGUMENT,"Now no enemy was to be seen in the sky, but the summer sun was burning"
2271,ARGUMENT,fiercely; from it the birds had taken refuge in the grove of grain: some
2272,ARGUMENT,"were lying on the turf, others bathing in the sand."
2273,ARGUMENT,
2274,ARGUMENT,"Amid the birds' heads rose little human heads, uncovered, with short hair,"
2275,ARGUMENT,"white as flax, their necks bare to the shoulders; in their midst was a"
2276,ARGUMENT,"girl, a head higher than they, with longer hair. Just behind the children"
2277,ARGUMENT,"sat a peacock, and spread out wide the circle of its tail into a"
2278,ARGUMENT,"many-coloured rainbow, against the deep blue of which the little white"
2279,ARGUMENT,heads were relieved as on the background of a picture; they gathered
2280,ARGUMENT,"radiance, being surrounded by the gleaming eyes of the tail as by a wreath"
2281,ARGUMENT,"of stars, and they shone amid the grain as in the transparent ether,"
2282,ARGUMENT,"between the golden stalks of the maize, the English grass with its silvery"
2283,ARGUMENT,"stripes, the coral mercury, and the green mallow, the forms and colours of"
2284,ARGUMENT,"which were mingled together like a lattice plaited of silver and gold, and"
2285,ARGUMENT,waving in the air like a light veil.
2286,ARGUMENT,
2287,ARGUMENT,Above the mass of many-coloured ears and stalks hung like a canopy a
2288,ARGUMENT,"bright cloud of butterflies,50 whose four-parted wings were light as a"
2289,ARGUMENT,spider's web and transparent as glass; when they hover in the air they are
2290,ARGUMENT,"hardly visible, and, though they hum, you fancy that they are motionless."
2291,ARGUMENT,
2292,ARGUMENT,"The girl waved in her uplifted hand a grey tassel, like a bunch of ostrich"
2293,ARGUMENT,"plumes, and seemed to be protecting with it the heads of the children from"
2294,ARGUMENT,the golden rain of the butterflies--in her other hand shone something
2295,ARGUMENT,"horn-like and gilded, apparently an instrument for feeding children, for"
2296,ARGUMENT,she approached it to each child in turn; it was formed like the golden
2297,ARGUMENT,horn of Amalthea.
2298,ARGUMENT,
2299,ARGUMENT,Even though thus engaged she turned her head towards the gooseberry
2300,ARGUMENT,"bushes, mindful of the rustling she had heard among them, and not knowing"
2301,ARGUMENT,"that her assailant had already drawn near from the opposite direction,"
2302,ARGUMENT,crawling like a serpent over the borders. Suddenly he jumped out from the
2303,ARGUMENT,"burdock; she looked--he was standing near at hand, four beds away from her,"
2304,ARGUMENT,and was bowing low. She had already turned away her head and lifted her
2305,ARGUMENT,"arms, and was hurrying to fly away like a frightened lark, and already her"
2306,ARGUMENT,"light steps were brushing over the leaves, when the children, frightened"
2307,ARGUMENT,"by the entrance of the stranger, and the flight of the girl, began to wail"
2308,ARGUMENT,"piteously. She heard them, and felt that it was unseemly to desert little"
2309,ARGUMENT,"children in their fright; she went back, hesitating, but she must needs go"
2310,ARGUMENT,"back, like an unwilling spirit, summoned by the incantations of a diviner."
2311,ARGUMENT,"She ran up to divert the child that was shrieking the loudest, sat down by"
2312,ARGUMENT,"him on the ground, and clasped him to her bosom; the others she soothed"
2313,ARGUMENT,"with her hand and with tender words until they became calm, hugging her"
2314,ARGUMENT,"knees with their little arms and snuggling their heads, like chickens"
2315,ARGUMENT,"beneath their mother's wing. ""Is it nice to cry so?"" she said, ""is it"
2316,ARGUMENT,polite? This gentleman will be afraid of you; he did not come to frighten
2317,ARGUMENT,"you, he is not an ugly old beggar; he is a guest, a kind gentleman, just"
2318,ARGUMENT,"see how pretty he is."""
2319,ARGUMENT,
2320,ARGUMENT,"She looked herself; the Count smiled pleasantly, and was evidently"
2321,ARGUMENT,"grateful to her for so many praises. She noticed this, and stopped,"
2322,ARGUMENT,"lowered her eyes, and blushed all over like a rosebud."
2323,ARGUMENT,
2324,ARGUMENT,"He was really a handsome gentleman; of tall stature, with an oval face,"
2325,ARGUMENT,fair and with rosy cheeks; he had mild blue eyes and long blonde hair. The
2326,ARGUMENT,"leaves and tufts of grass in the Count's hair, which he had torn off in"
2327,ARGUMENT,"crawling over the borders, showed green like a disordered wreath."
2328,ARGUMENT,
2329,ARGUMENT,"""O thou!"" he said, ""by whatever name I must honour thee, whether thou art"
2330,ARGUMENT,"a goddess or a nymph, a spirit or a phantom, speak! Doth thine own will"
2331,ARGUMENT,"call thee to earth, or doth another's power bind thee in this vale? Ah! I"
2332,ARGUMENT,"comprehend--surely some disdained lover, some powerful lord or envious"
2333,ARGUMENT,guardian imprisons thee in this castle park as if under enchantment! Thou
2334,ARGUMENT,"art worthy that knights should fight for thee in arms, and that thou"
2335,ARGUMENT,"shouldst be the heroine of mournful ballads! Unfold to me, fair one, the"
2336,ARGUMENT,"secret of thy dreadful fate! Thou shalt find a deliverer--henceforth, as"
2337,ARGUMENT,"thou rulest my heart by thy nod, so rule my arm."""
2338,ARGUMENT,
2339,ARGUMENT,"He stretched forth his arms.--She listened to him with a maiden's blush,"
2340,ARGUMENT,but with a face once more cheerful. As a child likes to look at gay
2341,ARGUMENT,pictures and finds amusement in glittering counters before he learns their
2342,ARGUMENT,"true worth, so her ears were soothed by the sounding words of which she"
2343,ARGUMENT,"did not understand the meaning. Finally she asked: ""Where do you come"
2344,ARGUMENT,"from, sir, and what are you looking for here in the garden?"""
2345,ARGUMENT,
2346,ARGUMENT,"The Count opened his eyes, confused and amazed, and did not reply."
2347,ARGUMENT,"Finally, lowering the tone of his discourse, he said:--"
2348,ARGUMENT,
2349,ARGUMENT,"""Pardon me, my little lady; I see that I have spoiled your fun! O pardon"
2350,ARGUMENT,"me, I was just hurrying to breakfast; it is late and I wanted to get there"
2351,ARGUMENT,on time. You know that by the road one has to make a circuit; through the
2352,ARGUMENT,"garden it seems to me there is a short cut to the house."""
2353,ARGUMENT,
2354,ARGUMENT,"""There is your way, sir,"" said the girl; ""only you must not spoil the"
2355,ARGUMENT,"vegetable beds; there is the path between the strips of grass."""
2356,ARGUMENT,
2357,ARGUMENT,"""To the left?"" asked the Count, ""or to the right?"""
2358,ARGUMENT,
2359,ARGUMENT,"The little gardener, filled with curiosity, raised her blue eyes and"
2360,ARGUMENT,"seemed to scrutinise him, for a thousand steps away the house was in plain"
2361,ARGUMENT,"sight, and the Count was asking the way! But the Count needs must say"
2362,ARGUMENT,"something to her, and was seeking an excuse for conversation."
2363,ARGUMENT,
2364,ARGUMENT,"""Do you live here? near the garden? or in the village? How happens it that"
2365,ARGUMENT,I have not seen you at the mansion? Have you come recently? Perhaps you
2366,ARGUMENT,"are a visitor?"""
2367,ARGUMENT,
2368,ARGUMENT,The girl shook her head.
2369,ARGUMENT,
2370,ARGUMENT,"""Pardon me, my little lady, but is not that your room, where we see the"
2371,ARGUMENT,"window?"""
2372,ARGUMENT,
2373,ARGUMENT,"""If she is not a heroine of romance,"" he was thinking to himself, ""she is"
2374,ARGUMENT,"a young and fresh and very pretty girl. Very often a great soul, a great"
2375,ARGUMENT,"thought, hidden in solitude, blooms like the rose in the midst of the"
2376,ARGUMENT,"forest; it will be sufficient to bring it forth to the light, and put it"
2377,ARGUMENT,"before the sun, to have it amaze by a thousand bright colours those who"
2378,ARGUMENT,"gaze upon it!"""
2379,ARGUMENT,
2380,ARGUMENT,The little gardener meanwhile remained silent. She merely lifted up one
2381,ARGUMENT,"child, who was hanging on her arm, took another by the hand, and, driving"
2382,ARGUMENT,"several of them before her like geese, moved on through the garden."
2383,ARGUMENT,
2384,ARGUMENT,"""Can you not,"" she said turning around, ""drive my stray birds back into"
2385,ARGUMENT,"the grain?"""
2386,ARGUMENT,
2387,ARGUMENT,"""I drive birds!"" cried the Count in amazement."
2388,ARGUMENT,
2389,ARGUMENT,Meanwhile she had vanished behind the shade of the trees. Only for a
2390,ARGUMENT,"moment there shone from behind the hedgerow, through the dense greenery,"
2391,ARGUMENT,something like two blue eyes.
2392,ARGUMENT,
2393,ARGUMENT,"The deserted Count long remained standing in the garden; his soul, like"
2394,ARGUMENT,"the earth after sunset, gradually grew cool, and took on dark colours. He"
2395,ARGUMENT,"began to muse, but he had very unpleasant dreams; he awoke, not knowing"
2396,ARGUMENT,"himself with whom he was angry. Alas, he had found little, and had had too"
2397,ARGUMENT,"great expectations! For, when he was crawling over the field towards that"
2398,ARGUMENT,"shepherdess, his head had burned and his heart leapt high; so many charms"
2399,ARGUMENT,"had he seen in the mysterious nymph, so wondrously had he decked her out,"
2400,ARGUMENT,so many conjectures had he made! He had found everything quite different;
2401,ARGUMENT,"to be sure, she had a pretty face, and a slender figure--but how lacking in"
2402,ARGUMENT,"elegance! And that tender face and lively blush, which painted excessive,"
2403,ARGUMENT,vulgar happiness! Evidently her mind was still slumbering and her heart
2404,ARGUMENT,"inactive. And those replies, so village-like, so common!"
2405,ARGUMENT,
2406,ARGUMENT,"""Why should I deceive myself?"" he exclaimed; ""I guess the secret, too"
2407,ARGUMENT,"late! My mysterious nymph is simply feeding geese!"""
2408,ARGUMENT,
2409,ARGUMENT,"With the disappearance of the nymph, all the magic glory had suffered a"
2410,ARGUMENT,"change; those bright bands, that charming network of gold and silver,"
2411,ARGUMENT,alas! was that all merely straw?
2412,ARGUMENT,
2413,ARGUMENT,"The Count, wringing his hands, gazed on a bunch of cornflowers tied round"
2414,ARGUMENT,"with grasses, which he had taken for a tuft of ostrich plumes in the"
2415,ARGUMENT,"maiden's hand. He did not forget the instrument: that gilded vessel, that"
2416,ARGUMENT,"horn of Amalthea, was a carrot! He had seen it being greedily consumed in"
2417,ARGUMENT,"the mouth of one of the children. So good-bye to the spell, the"
2418,ARGUMENT,"enchantment, the marvel!"
2419,ARGUMENT,
2420,ARGUMENT,"So a boy, when he sees chickory flowers enticing the hand with soft,"
2421,ARGUMENT,"light, blue petals, wishes to stroke them and draws near--he blows--and with"
2422,ARGUMENT,"the puff the whole flower flies away like down on the wind, and in his"
2423,ARGUMENT,hands the too curious inquirer sees only a naked stalk of grey-green
2424,ARGUMENT,grass.
2425,ARGUMENT,
2426,ARGUMENT,"The Count pulled his hat over his eyes and returned whence he came, but"
2427,ARGUMENT,"shortened the way by striding over the vegetables, the flowers, and the"
2428,ARGUMENT,"gooseberry bushes, until, vaulting the fence, he at last breathed freely!"
2429,ARGUMENT,He remembered that he had spoken to the girl of breakfast: so perhaps
2430,ARGUMENT,"everybody was already informed of his meeting with her in the garden, near"
2431,ARGUMENT,the house; perhaps they would send to look for him. Had they noticed his
2432,ARGUMENT,flight? Who knows what they would think? So he had to go back. Bending
2433,ARGUMENT,"down near the fence, along the boundary strip, and through the weeds,"
2434,ARGUMENT,"after a thousand turns he was glad to come out finally on the highway,"
2435,ARGUMENT,which led straight to the yard of the mansion. He walked along the fence
2436,ARGUMENT,"and turned away his head from the garden as a thief from a corn house, in"
2437,ARGUMENT,"order to give no sign that he thought of visiting it, or had already done"
2438,ARGUMENT,"so. Thus careful was the Count, though no one was following him; he looked"
2439,ARGUMENT,"in the opposite direction from the garden, to the right."
2440,ARGUMENT,
2441,ARGUMENT,"Here was an open grove, with a floor of turf; over this green carpet,"
2442,ARGUMENT,"among the white trunks of the birches, under the canopy of luxuriant"
2443,ARGUMENT,"drooping boughs, roamed a multitude of forms, whose strange dance-like"
2444,ARGUMENT,"motions and strange costumes made one think them ghosts, wandering by the"
2445,ARGUMENT,"light of the moon. Some were in tight black garments, others in long,"
2446,ARGUMENT,"flowing robes, bright as snow; one wore a hat broad as a hoop, another was"
2447,ARGUMENT,"bare-headed; some, as if they had been wrapt in a cloud, in walking spread"
2448,ARGUMENT,out on the breeze veils that trailed behind their heads as the tail behind
2449,ARGUMENT,"a comet. Each had a different posture: one had grown into the earth, and"
2450,ARGUMENT,"only turned about his downcast eyes; another, looking straight before him,"
2451,ARGUMENT,"as if in a dream, seemed to be walking along a line, turning neither to"
2452,ARGUMENT,the right nor to the left. But all continually bent down to the ground in
2453,ARGUMENT,"various directions, as if making deep bows. If they approached one"
2454,ARGUMENT,"another, or met, they did not speak or exchange greetings, being in deep"
2455,ARGUMENT,"meditation, absorbed in themselves. In them the Count saw an image of the"
2456,ARGUMENT,"shades in the Elysian Fields, who, not subject to disease or care, wander"
2457,ARGUMENT,"calm and quiet, but gloomy."
2458,ARGUMENT,
2459,ARGUMENT,"Who would have guessed that these people, so far from lively and so"
2460,ARGUMENT,"silent, were our friends, the Judge's comrades? From the noisy breakfast"
2461,ARGUMENT,they had gone out to the solemn ceremony of mushroom-gathering; being
2462,ARGUMENT,"discreet people, they knew how to moderate their speech and their"
2463,ARGUMENT,"movements, in order under all circumstances to adapt them to the place and"
2464,ARGUMENT,"time. Therefore, before they followed the Judge to the wood, they had"
2465,ARGUMENT,"assumed a different bearing, and put on different attire, linen dusters"
2466,ARGUMENT,"suitable for a stroll, with which they covered and protected their"
2467,ARGUMENT,"kontuszes; and on their heads they wore straw hats, so that they looked"
2468,ARGUMENT,white as spirits in Purgatory. The young people had also changed their
2469,ARGUMENT,"clothes, except Telimena and a few who wore French attire.--This scene the"
2470,ARGUMENT,"Count had not understood, being unfamiliar with village customs; hence,"
2471,ARGUMENT,"amazed beyond measure, he ran full speed to the wood."
2472,ARGUMENT,
2473,ARGUMENT,Of mushrooms51 there were plenty: the lads gathered the fair-cheeked
2474,ARGUMENT,"_fox-mushrooms_, so famous in the Lithuanian songs as the emblem of"
2475,ARGUMENT,"maidenhood, for the worms do not eat them, and, marvellous to say, no"
2476,ARGUMENT,insect alights on them; the young ladies hunted for the slender
2477,ARGUMENT,"_pine-lover_, which the song calls the colonel of the mushrooms.52 All"
2478,ARGUMENT,"were eager for the  _orange-agaric;_ this, though of more modest stature"
2479,ARGUMENT,"and less famous in song, is still the most delicious, whether fresh or"
2480,ARGUMENT,"salted, whether in autumn or in winter. But the Seneschal gathered the"
2481,ARGUMENT,toadstool _fly-bane_.
2482,ARGUMENT,
2483,ARGUMENT,The remainder of the mushroom family are despised because they are
2484,ARGUMENT,"injurious or of poor flavour, but they are not useless; they give food to"
2485,ARGUMENT,"beasts and shelter to insects, and are an ornament to the groves. On the"
2486,ARGUMENT,green cloth of the meadows they rise up like lines of table dishes: here
2487,ARGUMENT,"are the _leaf-mushrooms_ with their rounded borders, silver, yellow, and"
2488,ARGUMENT,"red, like little glasses filled with various sorts of wine; the _kozlak_,"
2489,ARGUMENT,"like the bulging bottom of an upturned cup; the _funnels_, like slender"
2490,ARGUMENT,"champagne glasses; the round, white, broad, flat _whities_, like china"
2491,ARGUMENT,"coffee-cups filled with milk; and the round _puff-ball_, filled with a"
2492,ARGUMENT,"blackish dust, like a pepper-shaker. The names of the others are known"
2493,ARGUMENT,only in the language of hares or wolves; by men they have not been
2494,ARGUMENT,"christened, but they are innumerable. No one deigns to touch the wolf or"
2495,ARGUMENT,"hare varieties; but whenever a person bends down to them, he straightway"
2496,ARGUMENT,"perceives his mistake, grows angry and breaks the mushroom or kicks it"
2497,ARGUMENT,with his foot: in thus defiling the grass he acts with great indiscretion.
2498,ARGUMENT,
2499,ARGUMENT,Telimena gathered neither the mushrooms of wolves nor those of humankind;
2500,ARGUMENT,"distracted and bored, she gazed around with her head high in air. So the"
2501,ARGUMENT,Notary angrily said of her that she was looking for mushrooms on the
2502,ARGUMENT,trees; the Assessor more maliciously compared her to a female looking
2503,ARGUMENT,about for a nesting-place.
2504,ARGUMENT,
2505,ARGUMENT,She seemed in search of quiet and solitude; slowly she withdrew from her
2506,ARGUMENT,"companions and went through the wood to a gently sloping hillock, well"
2507,ARGUMENT,shaded by the trees that grew thickly upon it. In the midst of it was a
2508,ARGUMENT,"grey rock; from under the rock a stream gurgled and spouted, and at once,"
2509,ARGUMENT,"as if it sought the shade, took refuge amid the tall, thick greenery,"
2510,ARGUMENT,"which, watered by it, grew luxuriantly on all sides. There that swift"
2511,ARGUMENT,"rogue, swaddled in grasses and bedded upon leaves, motionless and"
2512,ARGUMENT,"noiseless, whispered unseen and almost inaudibly, like a tired child laid"
2513,ARGUMENT,"in a cradle, when its mother ties above it the bright green curtains, and"
2514,ARGUMENT,sprinkles poppy leaves beneath its head. It was a lovely and quiet spot;
2515,ARGUMENT,"here Telimena often took refuge, calling it the Temple of Meditation."
2516,ARGUMENT,
2517,ARGUMENT,"Standing above the stream, she threw on the greensward, from her"
2518,ARGUMENT,"shoulders, her waving shawl, red as carnelian; and, like a swimmer who"
2519,ARGUMENT,"bends down to the wintry bath before she ventures to plunge in, she knelt"
2520,ARGUMENT,"and slowly inclined on her side; finally, as if drawn down by the stream"
2521,ARGUMENT,"of coral, she fell upon it and stretched out at full length: she rested"
2522,ARGUMENT,"her elbow on the grass, her temple on her palm, with her head bent down;"
2523,ARGUMENT,beneath her head glittered the vellum paper of a French book; over the
2524,ARGUMENT,alabaster pages of the book there wound her black ringlets and pink
2525,ARGUMENT,ribbons.
2526,ARGUMENT,
2527,ARGUMENT,"Amid the emerald of the luxuriant grass, on the carnelian shawl, in her"
2528,ARGUMENT,"long gown, as though in a wrapper of coral, against which her hair was"
2529,ARGUMENT,"relieved at one end and her black shoes at the other, while along the"
2530,ARGUMENT,"sides glittered her snowy stockings, her handkerchief, and the whiteness"
2531,ARGUMENT,"of her hands and face, she showed from afar like a many-coloured"
2532,ARGUMENT,"caterpillar, crawling upon a green maple leaf."
2533,ARGUMENT,
2534,ARGUMENT,Alas! all the charms and graces of this picture vainly awaited experts to
2535,ARGUMENT,"appreciate them; no one heeded them, so deeply were all engrossed in the"
2536,ARGUMENT,gathering of mushrooms. But Thaddeus heeded them and kept glancing
2537,ARGUMENT,"sideways; and, not daring to go straight on, edged along obliquely. As a"
2538,ARGUMENT,"huntsman, when, seated between two wheels beneath a moving canopy of"
2539,ARGUMENT,"boughs, he advances on bustards; or, when approaching plover, he hides"
2540,ARGUMENT,"himself behind his horse, putting his gun on the saddle or beneath the"
2541,ARGUMENT,"horse's neck, as if he were dragging a harrow or riding along a boundary"
2542,ARGUMENT,"strip, but continually draws near to the place where the birds are"
2543,ARGUMENT,standing: even so did Thaddeus steal forward.
2544,ARGUMENT,
2545,ARGUMENT,"The Judge foiled his plan; and, cutting him off, hurried to the spring. In"
2546,ARGUMENT,the wind fluttered the white skirts of his dressing-gown and a large
2547,ARGUMENT,"handkerchief, of which the end was fastened in his girdle; his straw hat,"
2548,ARGUMENT,"tied beneath his chin, flapped in the wind from his swift motion like a"
2549,ARGUMENT,"burdock leaf, falling now on his shoulders and now again over his eyes; in"
2550,ARGUMENT,his hand was an immense staff: thus strode on the Judge. Bending down and
2551,ARGUMENT,"washing his hands in the stream, he sat down on the great rock in front of"
2552,ARGUMENT,"Telimena, and, leaning with both hands on the ivory knob of his enormous"
2553,ARGUMENT,"cane, he thus began his discourse:--"
2554,ARGUMENT,
2555,ARGUMENT,"""You see, my dear, that ever since our Thaddeus has been our guest, I have"
2556,ARGUMENT,"been not a little disquieted. I am childless and old; this good lad, who"
2557,ARGUMENT,"is really my only comfort in the world, is the future heir of my fortune."
2558,ARGUMENT,By the grace of heaven I shall leave him no bad portion of gentleman's
2559,ARGUMENT,bread; it is time too that we think over his future and his settlement.
2560,ARGUMENT,"But now, my dear, pray observe my distress! You know that Jacek, my"
2561,ARGUMENT,"brother, Thaddeus's father, is a strange man, whose intentions are hard to"
2562,ARGUMENT,penetrate. He refuses to return home; God knows where he is hiding; he
2563,ARGUMENT,"will not even let us inform his son that he is alive, and yet he"
2564,ARGUMENT,continually gives us directions in regard to him. At first he wanted to
2565,ARGUMENT,"send him to the legions; I was fearfully distressed. Later, however, he"
2566,ARGUMENT,agreed that he might remain at home and marry. He would easily find a
2567,ARGUMENT,wife; I have a match in mind for him. None of our citizens compares in
2568,ARGUMENT,name or connections with the Chamberlain; his elder daughter Anna is of
2569,ARGUMENT,"marriageable age, a fair and well-dowered young lady. I wanted to begin"
2570,ARGUMENT,"negotiations."""
2571,ARGUMENT,
2572,ARGUMENT,"At this Telimena grew pale, closed her book, rose a bit, and sat up."
2573,ARGUMENT,
2574,ARGUMENT,"""As I love my mother,"" she said, ""is there any sense in this, my dear"
2575,ARGUMENT,brother? Are you a God-fearing man? So you think that you will really be
2576,ARGUMENT,doing a good turn to Thaddeus if you make a sower of buckwheat out of the
2577,ARGUMENT,"young man! You will close the world to him! Believe me, some time he will"
2578,ARGUMENT,curse you! To think of burying such talent in the woods and the garden!
2579,ARGUMENT,"Believe me, judging from my knowledge of him, he is a capable boy, worthy"
2580,ARGUMENT,"of acquiring polish in the great world. You will do well, brother, if you"
2581,ARGUMENT,"send him to the capital, for instance, to Warsaw; or, if you wish to know"
2582,ARGUMENT,"my real opinion, to St. Petersburg. I shall surely be going there this"
2583,ARGUMENT,winter on business; we will consider together what to do with Thaddeus. I
2584,ARGUMENT,know many people there and have influence; that is the best means of
2585,ARGUMENT,"making a man. Through my aid he will gain access to the leading houses,"
2586,ARGUMENT,and when he is known to important people he will get an office and a
2587,ARGUMENT,"decoration; then let him abandon the service if he wishes and return home,"
2588,ARGUMENT,being by that time of some importance and well known in society. What do
2589,ARGUMENT,"you think about that, brother?"""
2590,ARGUMENT,
2591,ARGUMENT,"""In his early years,"" said the Judge, ""it is not bad for a young man to"
2592,ARGUMENT,"gain social experience, to see the world, and acquire polish among men. I"
2593,ARGUMENT,"myself, when young, covered no small ground; I have been in Piotrkow and"
2594,ARGUMENT,"in Dubno, now following the court as a lawyer, now attending to my own"
2595,ARGUMENT,affairs; I have even visited Warsaw. Not a little did I profit by this. I
2596,ARGUMENT,"should like to send out my nephew also among men, simply as a traveller,"
2597,ARGUMENT,"as an apprentice who is finishing his term, in order that he might acquire"
2598,ARGUMENT,some little knowledge of the world. Not for the sake of office-holding or
2599,ARGUMENT,decorations! I beg your most humble pardon; a rank in the Muscovite
2600,ARGUMENT,"hierarchy, a decoration, what sort of distinction are they? What man among"
2601,ARGUMENT,"our ancient notables--nay, even among those of this present day--what man of"
2602,ARGUMENT,any prominence among the district gentry cares for such trifles? And yet
2603,ARGUMENT,"these men are esteemed among us, for we respect in them their family,"
2604,ARGUMENT,"their good name, or their office--but a local office, conferred by the"
2605,ARGUMENT,"votes of their fellow-citizens, and not by the influence of any one set in"
2606,ARGUMENT,"authority."""
2607,ARGUMENT,
2608,ARGUMENT,"""If that is your opinion, brother,"" interrupted Telimena, ""so much the"
2609,ARGUMENT,"better; send him out as a traveller."""
2610,ARGUMENT,
2611,ARGUMENT,"""You see, sister,"" said the Judge, mournfully scratching his head, ""I"
2612,ARGUMENT,"should like to do so very much, but what if I have new perplexities!"
2613,ARGUMENT,"Brother Jacek has not abandoned the oversight of his son, and has just"
2614,ARGUMENT,"sent down upon me that Bernardine Robak, who has arrived from across the"
2615,ARGUMENT,"Vistula, a friend of my brother, who knows all his plans. And so the fates"
2616,ARGUMENT,"have already uttered their decree as to Thaddeus, and will have him marry,"
2617,ARGUMENT,"but marry Zosia,53 your ward; the young couple will receive, besides my"
2618,ARGUMENT,"own fortune, a dowry in ready money by the generosity of Jacek. You know"
2619,ARGUMENT,"that he is rich, and that through his favour I possess almost all my own"
2620,ARGUMENT,"estate; thus he has the right to give directions. Pray think this over, in"
2621,ARGUMENT,order that it may be accomplished with the least possible trouble; we must
2622,ARGUMENT,"make them acquainted. To be sure, they are very young, especially little"
2623,ARGUMENT,"Zosia, but that is no matter; it is time at last to release Zosia from"
2624,ARGUMENT,"confinement, for at all events she is growing up and is no longer a"
2625,ARGUMENT,"child."""
2626,ARGUMENT,
2627,ARGUMENT,"Telimena, amazed and almost panic-stricken, raised herself gradually and"
2628,ARGUMENT,"knelt on the shawl; at first she listened with attention, then with a"
2629,ARGUMENT,"gesture she opposed him, waving her hand vigorously over her ear, as if"
2630,ARGUMENT,"she were driving off the unpleasant words like gnats, back into the mouth"
2631,ARGUMENT,of the speaker.
2632,ARGUMENT,
2633,ARGUMENT,"""Ha! ha! that is a new idea! Whether that is good or bad for Thaddeus,"""
2634,ARGUMENT,"she said angrily, ""you may judge for yourself, my dear sir. I don't care"
2635,ARGUMENT,"anything about Thaddeus, plan for him yourselves; make him a steward, or"
2636,ARGUMENT,"put him in a tavern; let him be a bar-tender, or bring game for your table"
2637,ARGUMENT,from the woods; do with him whatever you wish! But as for Zosia! What have
2638,ARGUMENT,you men to do with Zosia? I control her hand; I alone. That Jacek provided
2639,ARGUMENT,"money for Zosia's education, and that he has assigned her a small yearly"
2640,ARGUMENT,"allowance, and has deigned to promise more, does not mean that he has"
2641,ARGUMENT,"bought her. Besides you both know, and it is pretty generally known too,"
2642,ARGUMENT,that your generosity for us is not without its reasons; the Soplicas owe
2643,ARGUMENT,"something to the family of the Horeszkos."""
2644,ARGUMENT,
2645,ARGUMENT,To this part of her speech the Judge listened with indescribable confusion
2646,ARGUMENT,and grief and with evident repugnance. As though fearing what she might
2647,ARGUMENT,"say further, he bowed his head, made a gesture of assent, and flushed"
2648,ARGUMENT,deeply.
2649,ARGUMENT,
2650,ARGUMENT,Telimena concluded by saying:--
2651,ARGUMENT,
2652,ARGUMENT,"""I have had the care of her; I am of her kin, Zosia's only guardian. No"
2653,ARGUMENT,"one but me shall ever plan her happiness!"""
2654,ARGUMENT,
2655,ARGUMENT,"""But what if she finds happiness in this marriage?"" said the Judge,"
2656,ARGUMENT,"raising his eyes; ""what if she likes young Thaddeus?"""
2657,ARGUMENT,
2658,ARGUMENT,"""What if she likes him? That's a pear on a willow tree! Like him or"
2659,ARGUMENT,"not--much I care for that! To be sure Zosia will not be a wealthy match,"
2660,ARGUMENT,"but yet she is not a common village girl, a simple gentleman's daughter;"
2661,ARGUMENT,"her ancestors were called, 'Your Grace'; she is the child of a wojewoda;"
2662,ARGUMENT,her mother was a Horeszko: she will get a husband! I have taken such pains
2663,ARGUMENT,"with her education--if only she has not degenerated into savagery here!"""
2664,ARGUMENT,
2665,ARGUMENT,"The Judge listened with attention, looking her in the eye; he was"
2666,ARGUMENT,"apparently mollified, for he said cheerfully enough:--"
2667,ARGUMENT,
2668,ARGUMENT,"""Well, what's to be done? God knows that I have sincerely wished to do the"
2669,ARGUMENT,"right thing. Only do not be angry, sister; if you do not agree, sister,"
2670,ARGUMENT,"you are quite within your rights. It is a sad business, but there is no"
2671,ARGUMENT,"use being angry. I gave the advice, for my brother bade me; no one here is"
2672,ARGUMENT,"using compulsion. If you refuse Thaddeus, sister, I will reply to Jacek"
2673,ARGUMENT,that through no fault of mine the betrothal of Thaddeus and Zosia cannot
2674,ARGUMENT,come to pass. Now I will take my own counsel; perhaps I can open
2675,ARGUMENT,"negotiations with the Chamberlain and arrange the whole matter."""
2676,ARGUMENT,
2677,ARGUMENT,In the meantime Telimena's wrath had cooled down:--
2678,ARGUMENT,
2679,ARGUMENT,"""I do not refuse him, my dear brother; not at all! You said yourself that"
2680,ARGUMENT,"it is rather early, that they are too young. Let us think it over and"
2681,ARGUMENT,wait; that will do no harm. Let us make the young people acquainted; we
2682,ARGUMENT,will observe them--we must not thus expose to chance the happiness of
2683,ARGUMENT,"others. Only I caution you betimes, brother, do not prompt Thaddeus, and"
2684,ARGUMENT,"do not urge him to fall in love with Zosia, for the heart is not a"
2685,ARGUMENT,"servant, and acknowledges no master, and will not let itself be forcibly"
2686,ARGUMENT,"put in chains.""54"
2687,ARGUMENT,
2688,ARGUMENT,"Thereat the Judge, arising, walked away in deep thought. Thaddeus"
2689,ARGUMENT,"approached from the opposite side, pretending that the search for"
2690,ARGUMENT,mushrooms had enticed him there; the Count slowly moved on in the same
2691,ARGUMENT,direction.
2692,ARGUMENT,
2693,ARGUMENT,During the dispute between the Judge and Telimena the Count had been
2694,ARGUMENT,"standing behind the trees, mightily affected by the scene. He took from"
2695,ARGUMENT,"his pocket paper and pencil, implements that he had always with him, and,"
2696,ARGUMENT,"leaning on a stump and spreading out the sheet before him, he was"
2697,ARGUMENT,"evidently drawing a picture, and saying to himself: ""They might have been"
2698,ARGUMENT,"grouped thus intentionally, he on the rock, she on the grass, a"
2699,ARGUMENT,"picturesque group! What characteristic heads! and what contrasting faces!"""
2700,ARGUMENT,
2701,ARGUMENT,"He approached, checked himself, wiped his lorgnette, brushed his eyes with"
2702,ARGUMENT,"his handkerchief, and continued to gaze:--"
2703,ARGUMENT,
2704,ARGUMENT,"""Is this marvellous, this charming prospect destined to perish or to be"
2705,ARGUMENT,transformed when I approach near it? Will that velvet grass prove only
2706,ARGUMENT,poppies and beets? In that nymph shall I discover only a mere
2707,ARGUMENT,"housekeeper?"""
2708,ARGUMENT,
2709,ARGUMENT,Although before this the Count had often seen Telimena at the Judge's
2710,ARGUMENT,"house, where he had been a frequent visitor, he had paid little heed to"
2711,ARGUMENT,her; he was now amazed to find her the model of his picture. The beauty of
2712,ARGUMENT,"the spot, the charm of her posture, and the taste of her attire had so"
2713,ARGUMENT,changed her that she was hardly recognisable. Her eyes shone with her
2714,ARGUMENT,"recent anger, which was not yet extinct; her face, animated by the fresh"
2715,ARGUMENT,"breath of the breeze, by her dispute with the Judge, and by the sudden"
2716,ARGUMENT,"arrival of the young men, had assumed a deep flush, of unwonted"
2717,ARGUMENT,liveliness.
2718,ARGUMENT,
2719,ARGUMENT,"""Madam,"" said the Count, ""deign to pardon my boldness; I come both to"
2720,ARGUMENT,"crave forgiveness and to express my gratitude. To crave forgiveness, since"
2721,ARGUMENT,"I have stealthily followed your steps; and to express gratitude, since I"
2722,ARGUMENT,"have been the witness of your meditations. Much have I injured you, and"
2723,ARGUMENT,much do I owe to you! I have interrupted a moment of meditation; to you I
2724,ARGUMENT,owe moments of inspiration! blessed moments! Condemn the man; but the
2725,ARGUMENT,"artist awaits your forgiveness. Much have I dared, and more will I dare!"
2726,ARGUMENT,"Judge!"""
2727,ARGUMENT,
2728,ARGUMENT,Here he knelt and offered her his landscape.
2729,ARGUMENT,
2730,ARGUMENT,"Telimena passed judgment on his sketch with the tone of a courteous lady,"
2731,ARGUMENT,"but of one conversant with art; of praise she was chary, but she did not"
2732,ARGUMENT,spare encouragement.
2733,ARGUMENT,
2734,ARGUMENT,"""Bravo, I congratulate you,"" she said, ""you have no small talent. Only do"
2735,ARGUMENT,not neglect it; above all you need to search out a beautiful environment!
2736,ARGUMENT,O happy skies of the Italian lands! rose gardens of the Caesars! ye
2737,ARGUMENT,"classic cascades of Tibur, and dread craggy paths of Posilipo! That,"
2738,ARGUMENT,"Count, is the land of painters! On us may God have pity! A child of the"
2739,ARGUMENT,"Muses, put out to nurse in Soplicowo, would surely die. My dear Count, I"
2740,ARGUMENT,"will have this framed, or I will put it in my album, in my collection of"
2741,ARGUMENT,"drawings, which I have gathered from every source: I have numbers of them"
2742,ARGUMENT,"in my desk."""
2743,ARGUMENT,
2744,ARGUMENT,"So they began to converse of the blue of the skies, of the murmur of waves"
2745,ARGUMENT,"and of fragrant breezes, and of the summits of crags, mingling here and"
2746,ARGUMENT,"there, after the fashion of travellers, laughter and mockery at the land"
2747,ARGUMENT,"of their fathers. And yet around them stretched the forests of Lithuania,"
2748,ARGUMENT,"so majestic and so full of beauty! The black currant, intertwined with a"
2749,ARGUMENT,"wreath of wild hop; the service tree, with the fresh blush of a"
2750,ARGUMENT,"shepherdess; the hazel, like a mænad, with green thyrsuses, decked with"
2751,ARGUMENT,the pearls of its nuts as with clusters of grapes; and beneath them the
2752,ARGUMENT,"children of the forest, the hawthorn in the embrace of the elder, the"
2753,ARGUMENT,blackberry pressing its black lips upon the raspberry. The trees and
2754,ARGUMENT,"bushes joined hands with their leaves, like young men and maidens standing"
2755,ARGUMENT,ready for a dance around a married pair. In the midst of the company stood
2756,ARGUMENT,"the pair, distinguished from all the rest of the forest throng by"
2757,ARGUMENT,"gracefulness of form and charm of colour; the white birch, the beloved,"
2758,ARGUMENT,"with her husband the hornbeam. But farther off, like grave elders sitting"
2759,ARGUMENT,"in silence and gazing on their children and grandchildren, stood on this"
2760,ARGUMENT,"side hoary beeches, and on that matronly poplars; and an oak, bearded with"
2761,ARGUMENT,"moss, and bearing on its humped back the weight of five centuries,"
2762,ARGUMENT,supported itself--as on the broken pillars of sepulchres--on the petrified
2763,ARGUMENT,"corpses of other oaks, its ancestors."
2764,ARGUMENT,
2765,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus writhed, being not a little wearied by the long conversation in"
2766,ARGUMENT,which he could not take part. But when they began to glorify the forests
2767,ARGUMENT,"of foreign lands, and to enumerate in turn every variety of their"
2768,ARGUMENT,"trees--oranges, cypresses, olive trees, almonds, cactuses, aloes, mahogany,"
2769,ARGUMENT,"sandalwood, lemons, ivy, walnuts, even fig trees--praising extravagantly"
2770,ARGUMENT,"their forms, flowers, and bark, then Thaddeus constantly sniffed and"
2771,ARGUMENT,"grimaced, and finally could no longer restrain his wrath."
2772,ARGUMENT,
2773,ARGUMENT,"He was a simple lad, but he could feel the charm of nature, and, gazing on"
2774,ARGUMENT,"his ancestral forest, he said full of inspiration:--"
2775,ARGUMENT,
2776,ARGUMENT,"""In the botanical garden at Wilno I have seen those vaunted trees that"
2777,ARGUMENT,"grow in the east and the south, in that fair Italian land--which of them"
2778,ARGUMENT,can be compared to our trees? The aloe with its long stalk like a
2779,ARGUMENT,lightning rod? Or the dwarfish lemon tree with its golden balls and
2780,ARGUMENT,"lacquered leaves, short and dumpy, like a woman who is small and ugly, but"
2781,ARGUMENT,"rich? Or the much-praised cypress, long, thin, and lean, which seems the"
2782,ARGUMENT,"tree, not of grief, but of boredom? They say that it looks very sad upon a"
2783,ARGUMENT,"grave; but it is like a German flunkey in court mourning, who does not"
2784,ARGUMENT,"dare to lift his arms or turn his head, for fear that he may somehow"
2785,ARGUMENT,offend against etiquette.
2786,ARGUMENT,
2787,ARGUMENT,"""Is not our honest birch tree fairer, which is like a village woman"
2788,ARGUMENT,"weeping for her son, or a widow for her husband, who wrings her hands and"
2789,ARGUMENT,lets fall over her shoulders to the ground the stream of her loose
2790,ARGUMENT,"tresses? Mute with grief, how eloquently she sobs with her form! Count, if"
2791,ARGUMENT,"you are in love with painting, why do you not paint our own trees, among"
2792,ARGUMENT,"which you are sitting? Really, the neighbours will laugh at you, since,"
2793,ARGUMENT,"though you live in the fertile plain of Lithuania, you paint only crags"
2794,ARGUMENT,"and deserts."""
2795,ARGUMENT,
2796,ARGUMENT,"""Friend,"" said the Count, ""beautiful nature is the form, the ground, the"
2797,ARGUMENT,"material, but the soul is inspiration, which rises on the wings of"
2798,ARGUMENT,"imagination, is polished by taste, and is supported by rules. Nature is"
2799,ARGUMENT,"not enough, enthusiasm is not enough; the artist must fly away into the"
2800,ARGUMENT,spheres of the ideal! Not everything that is beautiful can be painted! You
2801,ARGUMENT,will learn all this from books in the course of time. As for painting: for
2802,ARGUMENT,"a picture one requires viewpoints, grouping, ensemble--and sky, the Italian"
2803,ARGUMENT,"sky! Hence in landscape art Italy was, is, and will be the country of"
2804,ARGUMENT,"painters. Hence also, except for Breughel--not Van der Helle, but the"
2805,ARGUMENT,"landscapist, for there are two Breughels55--and except for Ruysdael, in the"
2806,ARGUMENT,whole north where has there been a landscape artist of the first rank? The
2807,ARGUMENT,"sky, the sky is necessary."""
2808,ARGUMENT,
2809,ARGUMENT,"""Our painter Orlowski,""56 interrupted Telimena, ""had a Soplica's taste."
2810,ARGUMENT,"(You must know that this is the malady of the Soplicas, not to like"
2811,ARGUMENT,"anything except their own country.) Orlowski, who spent his life in St."
2812,ARGUMENT,"Petersburg, a famous painter (I have some of his sketches in my desk),"
2813,ARGUMENT,"dwelt close by the Emperor, in his court, as in paradise; and, Count, you"
2814,ARGUMENT,"cannot believe how homesick he was, he loved constantly to call to mind"
2815,ARGUMENT,"the days of his youth; he glorified everything in Poland, land, sky,"
2816,ARGUMENT,"forests."""
2817,ARGUMENT,
2818,ARGUMENT,"""And he was right,"" cried Thaddeus warmly; ""that Italian sky of yours, so"
2819,ARGUMENT,"far as I have heard of it, is blue and clear, but yet is like frozen"
2820,ARGUMENT,"water: are not wind and storm a hundred times more beautiful? In our land,"
2821,ARGUMENT,"if you merely raise your head, how many sights meet your eye! how many"
2822,ARGUMENT,scenes and pictures from the very play of the clouds! For each cloud is
2823,ARGUMENT,"different; for instance, in spring they crawl like lazy tortoises, heavy"
2824,ARGUMENT,"with showers, and send down from the sky to the earth long streamers like"
2825,ARGUMENT,loose tresses: those are the streams of rain. The hail cloud flies swiftly
2826,ARGUMENT,"on the wind like a balloon; it is round and dark-blue, with a glint of"
2827,ARGUMENT,yellow in the centre; around it may be heard a mighty uproar. Even these
2828,ARGUMENT,"white cloudlets of every day, just see how rapidly they change! At first"
2829,ARGUMENT,"they are like a flock of wild geese or swans; and from behind, the wind,"
2830,ARGUMENT,"like a falcon, drives them into a dense throng; they crowd together, grow"
2831,ARGUMENT,"and increase; new marvels! They gain curved necks, send forth manes, shoot"
2832,ARGUMENT,"out rows of legs, and over the vault of the skies they fly like a herd of"
2833,ARGUMENT,chargers across the steppe. All are white as silver; they have fallen into
2834,ARGUMENT,"confusion; suddenly masts grow from their necks, and from their manes"
2835,ARGUMENT,"broad sails; the herd changes into a ship, and majestically floats slowly"
2836,ARGUMENT,"and quietly across the blue plain of the skies!"""
2837,ARGUMENT,
2838,ARGUMENT,The Count and Telimena looked up; Thaddeus with one hand pointed out a
2839,ARGUMENT,"cloud to them, while with the other he squeezed Telimena's dainty fingers."
2840,ARGUMENT,The quiet scene lasted for several minutes; the Count spread a sheet of
2841,ARGUMENT,"paper on his hat and took out his pencil; then, unwelcome to their ears,"
2842,ARGUMENT,"the house bell resounded, and straightway the quiet wood was full of cries"
2843,ARGUMENT,and uproar.
2844,ARGUMENT,
2845,ARGUMENT,"The Count, nodding his head, said in an impressive tone:--"
2846,ARGUMENT,
2847,ARGUMENT,"""Thus fate is wont to end all in this world by the sound of a bell. The"
2848,ARGUMENT,"calculations of mighty minds, the plans of imagination, the sports of"
2849,ARGUMENT,"innocence, the joys of friendship, the outpourings of feeling hearts! when"
2850,ARGUMENT,"the bronze roars from afar all is confused, shattered, perturbed--and"
2851,ARGUMENT,"vanishes!"""
2852,ARGUMENT,
2853,ARGUMENT,"Then, turning a feeling glance on Telimena, he added, ""What remains?"" and"
2854,ARGUMENT,"she said to him, ""Remembrance""; and, desiring somewhat to relieve the"
2855,ARGUMENT,"Count's sadness, she gave him a forget-me-not that she had plucked. The"
2856,ARGUMENT,Count kissed it and pinned it on his bosom. Thaddeus on the other side
2857,ARGUMENT,"separated the branches of a shrub, seeing that through the greenery"
2858,ARGUMENT,something white was stealing towards him. This was a little hand white as
2859,ARGUMENT,"a lily; he seized it, kissed it, and silently buried his lips in it as a"
2860,ARGUMENT,bee in the cup of a lily. On his lips he felt something cold; he found a
2861,ARGUMENT,key and a bit of white paper curled up in the hole of it; this was a
2862,ARGUMENT,little note. He seized it and hid it in his pocket; he did not know what
2863,ARGUMENT,"the key meant, but that little white note would explain."
2864,ARGUMENT,
2865,ARGUMENT,"The bell still pealed, and, as an echo, from the depths of the quiet woods"
2866,ARGUMENT,there resounded a thousand cries and shouts; this was the uproar of people
2867,ARGUMENT,"searching for one another and calling, the signal that the"
2868,ARGUMENT,mushroom-gathering was over for the day: the uproar was not at all gloomy
2869,ARGUMENT,"or funereal, as it had seemed to the Count, but a dinner uproar.57 Every"
2870,ARGUMENT,"noon this bell, calling from the gable, invited the guests and servants"
2871,ARGUMENT,"home to dinner; such had been the custom on many old estates, and in the"
2872,ARGUMENT,Judge's house it had been preserved. So from the wood there came a throng
2873,ARGUMENT,"carrying boxes, and baskets, and handkerchiefs with their ends tied up--all"
2874,ARGUMENT,"full of mushrooms; each young lady carried in one hand, like a folded fan,"
2875,ARGUMENT,"a large _pine-lover_; in the other _tree-fungi_ tied together in a bunch,"
2876,ARGUMENT,"like field flowers, and _leaf-mushrooms_ of various colours. The Seneschal"
2877,ARGUMENT,"had his _fly-bane_. With empty hands came Telimena, and after her the"
2878,ARGUMENT,young gentlemen.
2879,ARGUMENT,
2880,ARGUMENT,The guests entered in order and stood about the table. The Chamberlain
2881,ARGUMENT,took his place at the head; this honour befitted him from his age and his
2882,ARGUMENT,"office; advancing to it he bowed to the ladies, the old men, and the young"
2883,ARGUMENT,"men. By him the Monk took his station, and next the Bernardine was the"
2884,ARGUMENT,"Judge. The Bernardine pronounced a short grace in Latin, brandy was passed"
2885,ARGUMENT,"around; thereupon all sat down, and in silence and with relish they ate"
2886,ARGUMENT,the cold Lithuanian salad of beet leaves.
2887,ARGUMENT,
2888,ARGUMENT,"The dinner was more quiet than usual; no one talked, despite the host's"
2889,ARGUMENT,entreaties. The factions involved in the mighty strife over the dogs were
2890,ARGUMENT,thinking of the morrow's contest and the wager; great thought is wont to
2891,ARGUMENT,"constrain the lips to silence. Telimena, though she talked constantly with"
2892,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus, was forced to turn now and then to the Count, and even now and"
2893,ARGUMENT,then to glance at the Assessor; thus a hunter gazes at the same time at
2894,ARGUMENT,"the net into which he is coaxing goldfinches, and at the snare for"
2895,ARGUMENT,"sparrows. Thaddeus and the Count were both content with themselves, both"
2896,ARGUMENT,"happy, both full of hopes, and therefore not inclined to chatter. The"
2897,ARGUMENT,"Count would cast a proud look at the flower, and Thaddeus would stealthily"
2898,ARGUMENT,"gaze into his pocket, to see whether that little key had not run away; he"
2899,ARGUMENT,would even reach in his hand and finger the note which he had not yet
2900,ARGUMENT,"read. The Judge, pouring out Hungarian wine and champagne for the"
2901,ARGUMENT,"Chamberlain, served him diligently, and often pressed his knees; but he"
2902,ARGUMENT,"had no zest for conversation with him, and it was evident that he felt"
2903,ARGUMENT,certain secret cares.
2904,ARGUMENT,
2905,ARGUMENT,They changed the plates and the viands in silence; at last the tiresome
2906,ARGUMENT,"routine of the dinner was interrupted by an unexpected guest. A forester,"
2907,ARGUMENT,"rushing in, did not even observe that it was dinner time, but ran up to"
2908,ARGUMENT,his master; from his bearing and his expression it was clear that he was
2909,ARGUMENT,the bringer of important and unwonted tidings. On him the whole company
2910,ARGUMENT,"turned their gaze; recovering his breath somewhat, he said: ""A bear, sir!"""
2911,ARGUMENT,"All guessed the rest, that the beast had come out from the _jungle_,58"
2912,ARGUMENT,that it was slipping through to the wilderness beyond the Niemen; all
2913,ARGUMENT,"immediately recognised that it must be pursued at once, although they had"
2914,ARGUMENT,not consulted together or thought the matter over. The common thought was
2915,ARGUMENT,"evident from the clipped words, the lively gestures, the various orders"
2916,ARGUMENT,"that were issued, which, though they came tumultuously and at one time"
2917,ARGUMENT,"from so many lips, still all tended to a like aim."
2918,ARGUMENT,
2919,ARGUMENT,"""To the village!"" shouted the Judge, ""on horseback, for the headman of the"
2920,ARGUMENT,"peasants! To-morrow at daybreak let the beaters be ready, but volunteers!"
2921,ARGUMENT,Whoever comes with a pike I will release from two days' work on the roads
2922,ARGUMENT,"and five days' field-service for myself."""
2923,ARGUMENT,
2924,ARGUMENT,"""Hurry,"" cried the Chamberlain, ""saddle my grey, and gallop full speed to"
2925,ARGUMENT,"my house; get quickly my two bulldogs,59 which are famous all over the"
2926,ARGUMENT,"district; the male is named Sprawnik, and the bitch Strapczyna.60 Gag"
2927,ARGUMENT,"them, tie them in a sack, and to save time bring them here on horseback."""
2928,ARGUMENT,
2929,ARGUMENT,"""Vanka,"" cried the Assessor in Russian to his boy, ""draw my Sanguszko"
2930,ARGUMENT,"hunting knife over the whetstone; you know, the knife that the prince"
2931,ARGUMENT,"presented to me; and look to my belt, to see whether there is a bullet in"
2932,ARGUMENT,"every cartridge."""
2933,ARGUMENT,
2934,ARGUMENT,"""Get the guns ready!"" shouted everybody."
2935,ARGUMENT,
2936,ARGUMENT,"The Assessor kept calling: ""Lead, lead! I have a bullet mould in my game"
2937,ARGUMENT,"bag."""
2938,ARGUMENT,
2939,ARGUMENT,"""Tell the parish priest,"" added the Judge, ""to serve mass early to-morrow"
2940,ARGUMENT,"in the forest chapel; a very short offertory for hunters, the usual mass"
2941,ARGUMENT,"of St. Hubert."""
2942,ARGUMENT,
2943,ARGUMENT,After the orders had been given a silence followed. All were deep in
2944,ARGUMENT,thought and cast their eyes around as if looking for some one; slowly the
2945,ARGUMENT,Seneschal's venerable face attracted and united all eyes. This was a sign
2946,ARGUMENT,that they were seeking a leader for their future expedition and that they
2947,ARGUMENT,"offered the staff of office to the Seneschal. The Seneschal rose,"
2948,ARGUMENT,"understood the will of his comrades, and, rapping impressively on the"
2949,ARGUMENT,"table, he drew from his bosom a golden chain, on which hung a watch large"
2950,ARGUMENT,as a pear.
2951,ARGUMENT,
2952,ARGUMENT,"""To-morrow,"" he said, ""at half past four, the gentlemen hunters and the"
2953,ARGUMENT,"beaters will present themselves at the forest chapel."""
2954,ARGUMENT,
2955,ARGUMENT,"He spoke, and moved from the table; after him went the Forester. These two"
2956,ARGUMENT,had to plan and arrange the chase.
2957,ARGUMENT,
2958,ARGUMENT,"Even so act generals, when they ordain a battle for the morrow--the"
2959,ARGUMENT,"soldiers throughout the camp clean their arms and eat, or sleep on cloaks"
2960,ARGUMENT,"or saddles, free from care, but the generals consult within the quiet"
2961,ARGUMENT,tent.
2962,ARGUMENT,
2963,ARGUMENT,"Dinner was interrupted, the day passed in the shoeing of horses, the"
2964,ARGUMENT,"feeding of dogs, the gathering and cleaning of arms; at supper hardly any"
2965,ARGUMENT,one came to the table. Even the faction of Bobtail ceased to be agitated
2966,ARGUMENT,by its long and weighty quarrel with the party of Falcon; the Notary and
2967,ARGUMENT,"the Assessor went arm in arm to look for lead. The rest, wearied with"
2968,ARGUMENT,"toil, went early to sleep, in order to rise in good season."
2969,ARGUMENT,
2970,ARGUMENT,"[To-day Thaddeus had been given a room in an out-building. Going in, he"
2971,ARGUMENT,"closed the door and hid the candle in the fireplace, pretending that he"
2972,ARGUMENT,had already gone to sleep--but he did not close his eyes. He evidently
2973,ARGUMENT,"awaited the night, and to him the time seemed long. He stood by the window"
2974,ARGUMENT,and through the opening cut in the shutter observed the doings of the
2975,ARGUMENT,"watchman, who was continually walking about the yard. When he saw him far"
2976,ARGUMENT,"away, at one bound he leapt out, closed the window, and bending to the"
2977,ARGUMENT,ground crept along like a pointer. His further steps the autumn night
2978,ARGUMENT,shrouded in thick darkness.61]

3001,ARGUMENT,"dread Witenes and the great Mindowe, and of Giedymin, when on the height"
3002,ARGUMENT,"of Ponary, by the huntsmen's fire, he lay on a bear skin, listening to the"
3003,ARGUMENT,"song of the wise Lizdejko; and, lulled by the sight of the Wilia and the"
3004,ARGUMENT,"murmur of the Wilejko, he dreamed of the iron wolf;62 and awakened, by the"
3005,ARGUMENT,"clear command of the gods, he built the city of Wilno, which sits among"
3006,ARGUMENT,"the forests as a wolf amid bison, wild boars, and bears. From this city of"
3007,ARGUMENT,"Wilno, as from the she-wolf of Rome, went forth Kiejstut and Olgierd and"
3008,ARGUMENT,"his sons,63 as mighty hunters as they were famous knights, in pursuit now"
3009,ARGUMENT,of their enemies and now of wild beasts. A hunter's dream disclosed to us
3010,ARGUMENT,"the secrets of the future, that Lithuania ever needs iron and wooded"
3011,ARGUMENT,lands.
3012,ARGUMENT,
3013,ARGUMENT,Ye forests! the last to come hunting among you was the last king who wore
3014,ARGUMENT,"the cap of Witold,64 the last fortunate warrior of the Jagiellos, and the"
3015,ARGUMENT,last huntsman among the rulers of Lithuania. Trees of my Fatherland! if
3016,ARGUMENT,"Heaven grants that I return to behold you, old friends, shall I find you"
3017,ARGUMENT,"still? Do ye still live? Ye, among whom I once crept as a child--does great"
3018,ARGUMENT,"Baublis65 still live, in whose bulk, hollowed by ages, as in a goodly"
3019,ARGUMENT,"house, twelve could sup at table? Does the grove of Mendog66 still bloom"
3020,ARGUMENT,"by the village church? And there in the Ukraine, does there still rise on"
3021,ARGUMENT,"the banks of the Ros, before the mansion of the Holowinskis, that linden"
3022,ARGUMENT,tree so far-spreading that beneath its shade a hundred youths and a
3023,ARGUMENT,hundred maidens were wont to join as partners in the dance?
3024,ARGUMENT,
3025,ARGUMENT,Monuments of our fathers! how many of you each year are destroyed by the
3026,ARGUMENT,"axes of the merchants, or of the Muscovite government! These vandals leave"
3027,ARGUMENT,"no refuge either for the forest warblers or for the bards, to whom your"
3028,ARGUMENT,"shade was as dear as to the birds. Yet the linden of Czarnolas, responsive"
3029,ARGUMENT,"to the voice of Jan Kochanowski, inspired in him so many rimes!67 Yet that"
3030,ARGUMENT,prattling oak still sings of so many marvels to the Cossack bard!68
3031,ARGUMENT,
3032,ARGUMENT,"How much do I owe to you, trees of my Homeland! A wretched huntsman,"
3033,ARGUMENT,"fleeing from the mockery of my comrades, in exchange for the game that I"
3034,ARGUMENT,"missed how many fancies did I capture beneath your calm, when in the wild"
3035,ARGUMENT,"thicket, forgetful of the chase, I sat me down amid a clump of trees!"
3036,ARGUMENT,"Around me here the greybearded moss showed silver, streaked with the blue"
3037,ARGUMENT,"of dark, crushed berries; there heathery hillocks shone red, decked with"
3038,ARGUMENT,cowberries as with rosaries of coral.--All about was darkness: over me the
3039,ARGUMENT,"branches hung like low, thick, green clouds; somewhere above the"
3040,ARGUMENT,"motionless vault the wind played with a wailing, roaring, howling,"
3041,ARGUMENT,"crashing thunder; a strange, deafening uproar! It seemed to me that there"
3042,ARGUMENT,above my head rolled a hanging sea.
3043,ARGUMENT,
3044,ARGUMENT,"Below, the crumbling remains of cities meet the eye. Here an overthrown"
3045,ARGUMENT,"oak protrudes from the ground, like an immense ruin; on it seem to rest"
3046,ARGUMENT,"fragments of walls and columns; on this side are branching stumps, on that"
3047,ARGUMENT,"half-rotted beams, enclosed with a hedge of grass. Within the barricade it"
3048,ARGUMENT,"is terrible to look: there dwell the lords of the forest, wild boars,"
3049,ARGUMENT,"bears, and wolves; at the gate lie the half-gnawed bones of some unwary"
3050,ARGUMENT,"guests. Sometimes there rise up through the green of the grass, like two"
3051,ARGUMENT,"jets of water, a pair of stag's antlers; and a beast flits between the"
3052,ARGUMENT,"trees like a yellow streak, as when a sunbeam falls between the forest"
3053,ARGUMENT,trees and dies.
3054,ARGUMENT,
3055,ARGUMENT,And again there is quiet below. A woodpecker on a fir tree raps lightly
3056,ARGUMENT,"and flies farther on and vanishes; it has hidden, but does not cease to"
3057,ARGUMENT,"tap with its beak, like a child when it has hidden and wishes to be sought"
3058,ARGUMENT,"for. Nearer sits a squirrel, holding a nut in its paws and gnawing it; its"
3059,ARGUMENT,tail hangs over its eyes like the plume over a cuirassier's helmet: even
3060,ARGUMENT,"though thus protected, it keeps glancing about; perceiving the guest, this"
3061,ARGUMENT,dancer of the woods skips from tree to tree and flashes like lightning;
3062,ARGUMENT,"finally it slips into an invisible opening of a stump, like a Dryad"
3063,ARGUMENT,returning to her native tree. Again all is quiet.
3064,ARGUMENT,
3065,ARGUMENT,"Now a branch shakes from the touch of some one's hand, and between the"
3066,ARGUMENT,parted clusters of the service berries shines a face more fair than they.
3067,ARGUMENT,It is a maiden gathering berries or nuts; in a basket of simple bark she
3068,ARGUMENT,"offers you freshly gathered cowberries, rosy as her lips. By her side"
3069,ARGUMENT,walks a youth who bends down the branches of the hazel tree; the girl
3070,ARGUMENT,catches the nuts as they flash by her.
3071,ARGUMENT,
3072,ARGUMENT,Now they have heard the peal of the horns and the baying of the hounds;
3073,ARGUMENT,they guess that a hunt is drawing near them; and between the dense mass of
3074,ARGUMENT,"boughs, full of alarm, they vanish suddenly from the eye, like deities of"
3075,ARGUMENT,the forest.
3076,ARGUMENT,
3077,ARGUMENT,In Soplicowo there was a great commotion; but neither the barking of the
3078,ARGUMENT,"dogs, nor the neighing of the horses and the creaking of the carts, nor"
3079,ARGUMENT,the blare of the horns that gave the signal for the hunt could stir
3080,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus from his bed; falling fully dressed on his couch, he had slept"
3081,ARGUMENT,like a marmot in its burrow. None of the young men thought of looking for
3082,ARGUMENT,him in the yard; every one was occupied with his own affairs and was
3083,ARGUMENT,hurrying to his appointed place; they entirely forgot their sleeping
3084,ARGUMENT,comrade.
3085,ARGUMENT,
3086,ARGUMENT,He was snoring. Through the heart-shaped opening that was cut in the
3087,ARGUMENT,"shutter the sun poured into the darkened room like a fiery column,"
3088,ARGUMENT,straight on the brow of the sleeping lad. He wanted to doze longer and
3089,ARGUMENT,"twisted about, trying to avoid the light; suddenly he heard a knocking and"
3090,ARGUMENT,awoke; cheerful was his awakening. He felt blithe as a bird and breathed
3091,ARGUMENT,freely and lightly; he felt himself happy and smiled to himself. Thinking
3092,ARGUMENT,"of all that had happened to him the day before, he blushed and sighed, and"
3093,ARGUMENT,his heart beat fast.
3094,ARGUMENT,
3095,ARGUMENT,"He looked at the window. Marvellous to say, in the sunlit aperture, within"
3096,ARGUMENT,"that heart, there shone two bright eyes, opened wide, as is wont to be the"
3097,ARGUMENT,case when one gazes from daylight into darkness; he saw also a little
3098,ARGUMENT,"hand, raised like a fan on the side towards the sun, to shield the gaze;"
3099,ARGUMENT,"the tiny fingers, turned towards the rosy light, reddened clear through,"
3100,ARGUMENT,"as if made of rubies; he beheld curious lips, slightly parted, and little"
3101,ARGUMENT,"teeth that shone like pearls among corals; and the face, though it was"
3102,ARGUMENT,"protected from the sun by a rosy palm, itself glowed all over like the"
3103,ARGUMENT,rose.
3104,ARGUMENT,
3105,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus was sleeping beneath the window; himself hidden in the shade,"
3106,ARGUMENT,"lying on his back, he wondered at the marvellous apparition, which was"
3107,ARGUMENT,"directly above him, almost touching his face. He did not know whether he"
3108,ARGUMENT,"was awake, or whether he was imagining one of those dear, bright childish"
3109,ARGUMENT,faces that we remember to have seen in the dreams of our innocent years.
3110,ARGUMENT,"The little face bent down: he beheld, trembling with fear and joy, alas!"
3111,ARGUMENT,"he beheld most clearly--he recalled and recognised now that short, bright"
3112,ARGUMENT,"golden hair done up in tiny curl papers white as snow, like silvery pods,"
3113,ARGUMENT,which in the gleam of the sun shone like a crown on the image of a saint.
3114,ARGUMENT,
3115,ARGUMENT,"He started up, and the vision straightway vanished, frightened by the"
3116,ARGUMENT,"noise; he waited, but it did not return! He only heard again a"
3117,ARGUMENT,"thrice-repeated knocking and the words: ""Get up, sir; it is time for"
3118,ARGUMENT,"hunting, you have overslept."" He jumped from his couch, and with both"
3119,ARGUMENT,"hands pushed back the shutters, so that their hinges rattled, and flying"
3120,ARGUMENT,open they knocked against the wall on either side. He rushed out and
3121,ARGUMENT,"looked around, amazed and confused, but he saw nothing, nor did he"
3122,ARGUMENT,perceive traces of any one. Not far from the window was the garden fence;
3123,ARGUMENT,on it the hop leaves and the flowery garlands were trembling; had some
3124,ARGUMENT,light hands touched them or had the wind stirred them? Thaddeus gazed long
3125,ARGUMENT,"on them, but did not dare enter the enclosure; he only leaned on the"
3126,ARGUMENT,"fence, raised his eyes, and, with his finger pressed on his lips, bade"
3127,ARGUMENT,"himself be silent, in order not to break the stillness by a hasty word."
3128,ARGUMENT,"Then he rapped his forehead, as though he were tapping for some ancient"
3129,ARGUMENT,"memories that had been lulled to sleep within him; finally, gnawing his"
3130,ARGUMENT,"fingers, he drew blood, and shouted at the top of his voice: ""It serves me"
3131,ARGUMENT,"right, it does."""
3132,ARGUMENT,
3133,ARGUMENT,"In the yard, where a few moments before there had been so many cries, now"
3134,ARGUMENT,everything was desolate and silent as in a graveyard; all had gone afield.
3135,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus pricked up his ears, and put his hands to them like trumpets; he"
3136,ARGUMENT,listened till the wind that blew from the forest brought to him the sound
3137,ARGUMENT,of horns and the shouts of the hunting throng.
3138,ARGUMENT,
3139,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus's horse was waiting saddled in the stable. So, musket in hand, he"
3140,ARGUMENT,"vaulted upon it, and like a madman galloped towards the inns that stood"
3141,ARGUMENT,"near the forest chapel, where the beaters were to have gathered at early"
3142,ARGUMENT,dawn.
3143,ARGUMENT,
3144,ARGUMENT,"The two taverns bent forward from either side of the road, threatening"
3145,ARGUMENT,each other with their windows like enemies. The old one rightfully
3146,ARGUMENT,belonged to the owner of the castle; the new one Judge Soplica had built
3147,ARGUMENT,"to spite the castle. In the former, as in his own inheritance, Gerwazy"
3148,ARGUMENT,ruled supreme; in the latter Protazy occupied the highest place at the
3149,ARGUMENT,table.
3150,ARGUMENT,
3151,ARGUMENT,The new tavern was not peculiar in its appearance. The old one was built
3152,ARGUMENT,"according to an ancient model, which was invented by Tyrian carpenters,"
3153,ARGUMENT,and later spread abroad over the world by the Jews; a style of
3154,ARGUMENT,architecture completely unknown to foreign builders: we inherit it from
3155,ARGUMENT,the Jews.
3156,ARGUMENT,
3157,ARGUMENT,"The tavern was in front like an ark, behind like a temple; the ark was"
3158,ARGUMENT,"Noah's genuine oblong chest, known to-day under the simple name of stable;"
3159,ARGUMENT,"in it there were various beasts, horses, cows, oxen, bearded goats; and"
3160,ARGUMENT,above flocks of birds; and a pair each of various sorts of reptiles--and
3161,ARGUMENT,"likewise insects. The rear portion, formed like a marvellous temple,"
3162,ARGUMENT,reminded one by its appearance of that edifice of Solomon that Hiram's
3163,ARGUMENT,"carpenters, the first skilled in the art of building, erected on Zion. The"
3164,ARGUMENT,"Jews imitate it to this day in their schools, and the design of the"
3165,ARGUMENT,schools may be traced in their taverns and stables. The roof of lath and
3166,ARGUMENT,"straw was peaked, turned-up, and crooked as a Jew's torn cap. From the"
3167,ARGUMENT,"gable protruded the edges of a balcony, supported on a row of close-set"
3168,ARGUMENT,"wooden columns; the columns, which were a great architectural marvel, were"
3169,ARGUMENT,"solid, though half decayed, and were put up crooked, as in the tower of"
3170,ARGUMENT,"Pisa; they did not conform to Greek models, for they lacked bases and"
3171,ARGUMENT,"capitals. On the columns rested semicircular arches, also of wood, in"
3172,ARGUMENT,"imitation of Gothic art. Above were artistic ornaments, crooked as the"
3173,ARGUMENT,"arms of Sabbath candlesticks,69 executed not with the graver or chisel,"
3174,ARGUMENT,but with skilful blows of the carpenter's hatchet; at their ends hung
3175,ARGUMENT,"balls, somewhat resembling the buttons that the Jews hang on their"
3176,ARGUMENT,"foreheads when they pray, and which, in their own, tongue, they call"
3177,ARGUMENT,"_cyces_. In a word, from a distance the tottering, crooked tavern was like"
3178,ARGUMENT,"a Jew, when he nods his head in prayer; the roof is his cap, the"
3179,ARGUMENT,"disordered thatch his beard, the smoky, dirty walls his black frock, and"
3180,ARGUMENT,in front the carving juts out like the _cyces_ on his brow.
3181,ARGUMENT,
3182,ARGUMENT,In the centre of the tavern was a partition like that in a Jewish school;
3183,ARGUMENT,"one portion, divided into long and narrow rooms, was reserved exclusively"
3184,ARGUMENT,for ladies and gentlemen who were travelling; the other formed one immense
3185,ARGUMENT,"hall. Along each wall stretched a many-footed narrow, wooden table; by it"
3186,ARGUMENT,"were benches, which, though lower, were as like the table as children are"
3187,ARGUMENT,"like their father. On these benches around the room sat peasants, both men"
3188,ARGUMENT,"and women, and likewise some of the minor gentry, all in rows; only the"
3189,ARGUMENT,Steward sat by himself. After early Mass they had come from the chapel to
3190,ARGUMENT,"Jankiel's, since it was Sunday, to have a drink and to amuse themselves."
3191,ARGUMENT,"By each a cup of greyish brandy was already frothing, the hostess was"
3192,ARGUMENT,"running about with the bottle, serving every one. In the centre of the"
3193,ARGUMENT,"room stood the host, Jankiel, in a long gown that reached to the floor,"
3194,ARGUMENT,and was fastened with silver clasps; one hand he had tucked into his black
3195,ARGUMENT,"silk girdle, with the other he stroked in dignified fashion his grey"
3196,ARGUMENT,"beard. Casting his eye about, he issued orders, greeted the guests who"
3197,ARGUMENT,"came in, went up to those that were seated, and started conversation,"
3198,ARGUMENT,"reconciled persons quarrelling, but served no one--he only walked to and"
3199,ARGUMENT,"fro. The Jew was old, and famed everywhere for his probity; for many years"
3200,ARGUMENT,"he had been keeping the tavern, and no one either of the peasants or of"
3201,ARGUMENT,the gentry had ever made complaint against him to his landlord. Of what
3202,ARGUMENT,should they complain? He had good drinks to choose from; he kept his
3203,ARGUMENT,"accounts strictly, but without any knavery; he did not forbid merriment,"
3204,ARGUMENT,but would not endure drunkenness. He was a great lover of entertainments;
3205,ARGUMENT,at his tavern marriages and christenings were celebrated; every Sunday he
3206,ARGUMENT,"had musicians come from the village, including a bass viol and bagpipes."
3207,ARGUMENT,
3208,ARGUMENT,He was familiar with music and was himself famous for his musical talent;
3209,ARGUMENT,"with the dulcimer, his national instrument, he had once wandered from"
3210,ARGUMENT,"estate to estate and amazed his hearers by his playing and his songs, for"
3211,ARGUMENT,"he sang well and with a trained voice. Though a Jew, he had a fairly good"
3212,ARGUMENT,"Polish pronunciation, and was particularly fond of the national songs, of"
3213,ARGUMENT,"which he had brought back a multitude from each trip over the Niemen,"
3214,ARGUMENT,"_kolomyjkas_70 from Halicz and _mazurkas_ from Warsaw. A report, I do not"
3215,ARGUMENT,"know how well founded, was current throughout the district, that he was"
3216,ARGUMENT,the first to bring from abroad and make popular in that time and place the
3217,ARGUMENT,"song which is to-day famous all over the world, and which was first played"
3218,ARGUMENT,in the Ausonian land to Italians by the trumpets of the Polish legions.71
3219,ARGUMENT,The talent of song pays well in Lithuania; it gains people's affection and
3220,ARGUMENT,makes one famous and rich. Jankiel had made a fortune; sated with gain and
3221,ARGUMENT,"glory, he had hung his nine-stringed dulcimer upon the wall, and settling"
3222,ARGUMENT,down with his children in the tavern he had taken up liquor-selling.
3223,ARGUMENT,"Besides this he was the under-rabbi in the neighbouring town, and always a"
3224,ARGUMENT,"welcome guest in every quarter, and a household counsellor: he had a good"
3225,ARGUMENT,knowledge of the grain trade on the river barges;72 such knowledge is
3226,ARGUMENT,needful in a village. He had also the reputation of being a patriotic
3227,ARGUMENT,Pole.73
3228,ARGUMENT,
3229,ARGUMENT,"He was the first to bring to an end the quarrels between the two taverns,"
3230,ARGUMENT,"which had often led even to bloodshed, by leasing them both. He was"
3231,ARGUMENT,equally respected by the old partisans of the Horeszkos and by the
3232,ARGUMENT,servants of Judge Soplica. He alone knew how to keep an ascendancy over
3233,ARGUMENT,the terrible Warden of the Horeszkos and the quarrelsome Apparitor; in
3234,ARGUMENT,Jankiel's presence both Gerwazy terrible of hand and Protazy terrible of
3235,ARGUMENT,tongue stifled their ancient wrongs.
3236,ARGUMENT,
3237,ARGUMENT,"Gerwazy was not there; he had gone to join the beaters, not wishing that"
3238,ARGUMENT,"the Count, young and inexperienced, should undertake alone so important"
3239,ARGUMENT,"and difficult an expedition. So he had gone with him for counsel, and"
3240,ARGUMENT,likewise for defence.
3241,ARGUMENT,
3242,ARGUMENT,"To-day Gerwazy's place, the farthest from the threshold, between two"
3243,ARGUMENT,"benches, in the very corner of the tavern (called _pokucie_74), was"
3244,ARGUMENT,"occupied by the Monk, Father Robak, the alms-gatherer. Jankiel had seated"
3245,ARGUMENT,"him there; he evidently highly respected the Bernardine, for whenever he"
3246,ARGUMENT,noticed that his glass was empty he immediately ran up and told them to
3247,ARGUMENT,pour out for him July mead.75 They said that the Bernardine and he had
3248,ARGUMENT,"been acquainted when young, somewhere off in foreign lands. Robak often"
3249,ARGUMENT,"came by night to the tavern, and consulted secretly with the Jew about"
3250,ARGUMENT,"important matters; they said that the Monk was smuggling goods, but this"
3251,ARGUMENT,was a slander unworthy of belief.
3252,ARGUMENT,
3253,ARGUMENT,"Leaning on the table, Robak was discoursing in a low voice; a throng of"
3254,ARGUMENT,"gentry surrounded him and pricked up their ears, and bent down their noses"
3255,ARGUMENT,"to the Monk's snuffbox. Each took a pinch, and the gentlemen sneezed like"
3256,ARGUMENT,mortars.
3257,ARGUMENT,
3258,ARGUMENT,"""Reverendissime,"" said Skoluba with a sneeze, ""that is fine tobacco, it"
3259,ARGUMENT,"goes way up to your topknot. Never since I have worn a nose""--here he"
3260,ARGUMENT,"stroked his long nose--""have I met its like""--here he sneezed a second time."
3261,ARGUMENT,"""It is real Bernardine, doubtless made in Kowno, a city famous throughout"
3262,ARGUMENT,"the world for tobacco and mead. I was there in----"""
3263,ARGUMENT,
3264,ARGUMENT,"""To the health of you all, my noble gentlemen!"""
3265,ARGUMENT,
3266,ARGUMENT,"Robak interrupted him. ""As for the tobacco--hm--it comes from farther off"
3267,ARGUMENT,"than my friend Skoluba thinks; it comes from Jasna Gora, the Bright"
3268,ARGUMENT,Mountain; the Paulist Brethren prepare such tobacco in the city of
3269,ARGUMENT,"Czenstochowa,76 where stands the image, famed for so many miracles, of Our"
3270,ARGUMENT,"Lady the Virgin, Queen of the Crown of Poland: she is likewise still"
3271,ARGUMENT,"called Duchess of Lithuania! She still watches over her royal crown, but"
3272,ARGUMENT,"in the Duchy of Lithuania the schism77 is now established!"""
3273,ARGUMENT,
3274,ARGUMENT,"""From Czenstochowa?"" said Wilbik. ""I confessed myself there when I went on"
3275,ARGUMENT,a pilgrimage thirty years ago. Is it true that the French are now visiting
3276,ARGUMENT,"the city, and that they are going to tear down the church and seize the"
3277,ARGUMENT,"treasury--for this is all printed in the _Lithuanian Courier?_"""
3278,ARGUMENT,
3279,ARGUMENT,"""No, it is not true,"" said the Bernardine. ""His Majesty the Emperor"
3280,ARGUMENT,"Napoleon is a most exemplary Catholic; the Pope himself anointed him, and"
3281,ARGUMENT,"they live in harmony, and spread the faith among the French people, which"
3282,ARGUMENT,has become a trifle corrupted. To be sure they have contributed much
3283,ARGUMENT,"silver from Czenstochowa to the national treasury, for the Fatherland, for"
3284,ARGUMENT,"Poland, as the Lord God himself bids; his altars are always the treasury"
3285,ARGUMENT,"of the Fatherland. Why, in the Duchy of Warsaw we have a Polish army of a"
3286,ARGUMENT,"hundred thousand, perhaps soon there will be more. And who will pay that"
3287,ARGUMENT,army? Will it be you Lithuanians? You are now giving your pennies only for
3288,ARGUMENT,"the Muscovite coffers."""
3289,ARGUMENT,
3290,ARGUMENT,"""The devil we are!"" cried Wilbik; ""they take them from us by force."""
3291,ARGUMENT,
3292,ARGUMENT,"""O, my dear sir,"" a peasant spoke up humbly, bowing to the Monk and"
3293,ARGUMENT,"scratching his head, ""for the gentry it is only half bad, but they skin"
3294,ARGUMENT,"_us_ like linden bark."""
3295,ARGUMENT,
3296,ARGUMENT,"""You stupid son of Ham!""78 cried Skoluba, ""it is easier for you; you"
3297,ARGUMENT,"peasants are as used to skinning as eels; but for us _men of birth_, us"
3298,ARGUMENT,"gentlemen accustomed to golden liberty! Ah, brothers! Why, in old times a"
3299,ARGUMENT,"gentleman on his garden patch----"""
3300,ARGUMENT,
3301,ARGUMENT,"""Yes, yes,"" they all cried, ""was a wojewoda's match.""79"
3302,ARGUMENT,
3303,ARGUMENT,"""To-day they even deny our gentle birth; they bid us hunt up papers and"
3304,ARGUMENT,"prove it by documents."""
3305,ARGUMENT,
3306,ARGUMENT,"""That's nothing for such as you!"" shouted Juraha. ""Your precious ancestors"
3307,ARGUMENT,"were peasants who obtained nobility, but I am of princes' blood! To ask me"
3308,ARGUMENT,"for a patent, showing when I became a nobleman! Only God remembers that!"
3309,ARGUMENT,Let the Muscovite go to the forest and ask the oak grove who gave it a
3310,ARGUMENT,"patent to grow above all the shrubs!"""
3311,ARGUMENT,
3312,ARGUMENT,"""Prince!"" said Zagiel. ""Go tell that to some one else! You will find no"
3313,ARGUMENT,"end of princes' coronets in this district."""
3314,ARGUMENT,
3315,ARGUMENT,"""You have a cross in your coat of arms,"" shouted Podhajski; ""that is a"
3316,ARGUMENT,covert allusion to the fact that a baptised Jew was a member of your
3317,ARGUMENT,"line."""
3318,ARGUMENT,
3319,ARGUMENT,"""That is false!"" interrupted Birbarz; ""now I spring from the blood of"
3320,ARGUMENT,"Tatar counts, and yet my coat bears crosses above a ship."""
3321,ARGUMENT,
3322,ARGUMENT,"""The white rose of five petals,"" cried Mickiewicz, ""with a cap in a golden"
3323,ARGUMENT,"field: it is a princely coat; Stryjkowski writes frequently of it.""80"
3324,ARGUMENT,
3325,ARGUMENT,After this a mighty hubbub arose all over the room. The Bernardine had
3326,ARGUMENT,recourse to his snuffbox; he offered a pinch to each of the orators in
3327,ARGUMENT,"turn, and the wrangling immediately subsided: each accepted for courtesy's"
3328,ARGUMENT,"sake, and sneezed several times. The Bernardine, taking advantage of the"
3329,ARGUMENT,"intermission, continued:--"
3330,ARGUMENT,
3331,ARGUMENT,"""Ah! this tobacco has made great men sneeze! Will you believe me that four"
3332,ARGUMENT,"times General Dombrowski has taken a pinch from this snuffbox?"""
3333,ARGUMENT,
3334,ARGUMENT,"""Dombrowski!"" they shouted."
3335,ARGUMENT,
3336,ARGUMENT,"""Yes, yes, he, the general. I was in the camp when he was recapturing"
3337,ARGUMENT,"Dantzic from the Germans.81 He had something to write; and, fearing that"
3338,ARGUMENT,"he might go to sleep, he took a pinch, sneezed, and twice patted me on the"
3339,ARGUMENT,"back. 'Father Robak,' he said, 'Father Bernardine, perhaps we shall see"
3340,ARGUMENT,each other in Lithuania before the year is over. Tell the Lithuanians to
3341,ARGUMENT,"receive me with Czenstochowa tobacco; I take none but that.' """
3342,ARGUMENT,
3343,ARGUMENT,The Monk's speech aroused such amazement and such joy that the whole noisy
3344,ARGUMENT,assembly was silent for a moment; then they repeated under their breath
3345,ARGUMENT,"the words, ""Tobacco from Poland? Czenstochowa? Dombrowski? from the"
3346,ARGUMENT,"Italian land?"" until finally all at once, as if thought had fused with"
3347,ARGUMENT,"thought and word with word, all cried with one voice, as if a signal had"
3348,ARGUMENT,"been given: ""Dombrowski!"" All shouted together, all embraced one another;"
3349,ARGUMENT,"the peasant and the Tatar count, the prince's hat and the cross, the white"
3350,ARGUMENT,"rose, the griffin, and the ship; they forgot everything, even the"
3351,ARGUMENT,"Bernardine; they only sang and shouted: ""Brandy, mead, wine!"""
3352,ARGUMENT,
3353,ARGUMENT,Father Robak listened to the song for a long time; finally he wanted to
3354,ARGUMENT,"cut it short. So he took in both hands his snuffbox, broke up the melody"
3355,ARGUMENT,"with a sneeze; and, before they got together again, he hastened to speak"
3356,ARGUMENT,thus:--
3357,ARGUMENT,
3358,ARGUMENT,"""You praise my tobacco, my good friends; now see what is going on inside"
3359,ARGUMENT,"the snuffbox."""
3360,ARGUMENT,
3361,ARGUMENT,"Here, wiping with his handkerchief the soiled base of the box, he showed"
3362,ARGUMENT,"them a little painted army, like a swarm of flies: in the middle sat a man"
3363,ARGUMENT,"on a charger, the size of a beetle, evidently the leader of the troop; he"
3364,ARGUMENT,"had made his horse rear, as though he wanted to leap into the skies; one"
3365,ARGUMENT,"hand he held on the bridle, the other up to his nose."
3366,ARGUMENT,
3367,ARGUMENT,"""Gaze,"" said Robak, ""at that threatening form, and guess whose it is."""
3368,ARGUMENT,
3369,ARGUMENT,All looked with curiosity.
3370,ARGUMENT,
3371,ARGUMENT,"""That is a great man, an emperor, but not of the Muscovites; their tsars"
3372,ARGUMENT,"have never used tobacco."""
3373,ARGUMENT,
3374,ARGUMENT,"""A great man,"" cried Cydzik, ""and in a long grey coat? I thought that"
3375,ARGUMENT,"great men wore gold, for among the Muscovites any sort of a general, sir,"
3376,ARGUMENT,"fairly shines with gold, like a pike in saffron."""
3377,ARGUMENT,
3378,ARGUMENT,"""Bah!"" interrupted Rymsza; ""why, in my youth I saw Kosciuszko, the chief"
3379,ARGUMENT,"of our nation: he was a great man, but he wore a Cracow peasant's coat,"
3380,ARGUMENT,"that is to say, a _czamara_."""
3381,ARGUMENT,
3382,ARGUMENT,"""Much he wore a _czamara_!""  retorted Wilbik. ""They used to call it a"
3383,ARGUMENT,"_taratatka_.""82"
3384,ARGUMENT,
3385,ARGUMENT,"""But the _taratatka_ has fringe,"" shouted Mickiewicz, ""and the other is"
3386,ARGUMENT,"entirely plain."""
3387,ARGUMENT,
3388,ARGUMENT,Thereupon there arose disputes over the various forms of the  _taratatka_
3389,ARGUMENT,and the _czamara_.
3390,ARGUMENT,
3391,ARGUMENT,"The ingenious Robak, seeing that the conversation was thus becoming"
3392,ARGUMENT,"scattered, undertook again to gather it to a focus--to his snuffbox: he"
3393,ARGUMENT,"treated them, they sneezed and wished one another good health; he"
3394,ARGUMENT,"continued his speech:-- ""When the Emperor Napoleon in an engagement takes"
3395,ARGUMENT,"snuff time after time, it is a sure sign that he is winning the battle."
3396,ARGUMENT,"For example, at Austerlitz: the French just stood beside their cannon, and"
3397,ARGUMENT,on them charged a host of Muscovites. The Emperor gazed and held his
3398,ARGUMENT,"peace; whenever the French shot, the Muscovites were simply mowed down by"
3399,ARGUMENT,regiments like grass. Regiment after regiment galloped on and fell from
3400,ARGUMENT,"the saddle; whenever a regiment fell, the Emperor took a pinch of snuff,"
3401,ARGUMENT,until finally Alexander with his little brother Constantine and the German
3402,ARGUMENT,"Emperor Francis fled from the field. So the Emperor, seeing that the fight"
3403,ARGUMENT,"was over, gazed at them, laughed, and dusted his fingers. And now if any"
3404,ARGUMENT,of you gentlemen who are present here ever serves in the army of the
3405,ARGUMENT,"Emperor, let him remember this."""
3406,ARGUMENT,
3407,ARGUMENT,"""Ah! my dear Monk!"" cried Skoluba, ""when will that be? Why, on every"
3408,ARGUMENT,holiday set down in the calendar they prophesy to us that the French are
3409,ARGUMENT,"coming, A man looks and looks until his eyes are weary, but the Muscovite"
3410,ARGUMENT,keeps on holding us by the neck as he always has. I fear that before the
3411,ARGUMENT,"sun rises the dew will ruin our eyes."""
3412,ARGUMENT,
3413,ARGUMENT,"""Sir, it is womanish to complain,"" said the Bernardine, ""and a Jewish"
3414,ARGUMENT,trick to wait with folded hands until some one rides up to the tavern and
3415,ARGUMENT,knocks on the door. With Napoleon it is not so hard to beat the
3416,ARGUMENT,"Muscovites; he has already three times thrashed the hide of the Suabians,"
3417,ARGUMENT,"he has trodden down the nasty Prussians, and has cast back the English"
3418,ARGUMENT,"straight across the sea: surely he will be equal to the Muscovites. But,"
3419,ARGUMENT,"my dear sir, do you know what will be the result? The gentry of Lithuania"
3420,ARGUMENT,"will mount their steeds and seize their sabres, but not until there is no"
3421,ARGUMENT,"longer any enemy with whom to fight. Napoleon, after crushing everybody"
3422,ARGUMENT,"alone, will finally say: 'I can get along without you: who are you?' So it"
3423,ARGUMENT,"is not enough to await a guest, not enough even to invite him in; one"
3424,ARGUMENT,needs to gather the servants and set up the tables; and before the banquet
3425,ARGUMENT,"one must clean the house of dirt; clean the house, I repeat; clean the"
3426,ARGUMENT,"house, my boys!"""
3427,ARGUMENT,
3428,ARGUMENT,"A silence followed, and then voices in the throng:--"
3429,ARGUMENT,
3430,ARGUMENT,"""How clean our house? What do you mean by that? We will do everything for"
3431,ARGUMENT,"you, we are ready for anything; only, my dear Father, pray explain"
3432,ARGUMENT,"yourself more clearly."""
3433,ARGUMENT,
3434,ARGUMENT,"The Monk glanced out of the window, interrupting the conversation; he"
3435,ARGUMENT,"noticed something peculiar, and put his head out of the window. In a"
3436,ARGUMENT,"moment he said, rising:--"
3437,ARGUMENT,
3438,ARGUMENT,"""To-day we have no time, later we will talk together more at length."
3439,ARGUMENT,"To-morrow I shall be in the district town on business, and on the way I"
3440,ARGUMENT,"will call on you gentlemen to gather alms."""
3441,ARGUMENT,
3442,ARGUMENT,"""Then call at Niehrymow to spend the night,"" said the Steward; ""the Ensign"
3443,ARGUMENT,"will be glad to see you, sir. An old Lithuanian proverb says: 'As lucky a"
3444,ARGUMENT,"man as an alms-gatherer in Niehrymow.' """
3445,ARGUMENT,
3446,ARGUMENT,"""And be good enough to visit us,"" said Zubkowski. ""You will get a"
3447,ARGUMENT,"half-piece of linen, a firkin of butter, a sheep or a cow. Remember these"
3448,ARGUMENT,"words, sir: 'A man is lucky if he strikes it as rich as a monk in"
3449,ARGUMENT,"Zubkow.' """
3450,ARGUMENT,
3451,ARGUMENT,"""And on us,"" said Skoluba; ""and on us,"" added Terajewicz; ""no Bernardine"
3452,ARGUMENT,"ever departed hungry from Pucewicze."""
3453,ARGUMENT,
3454,ARGUMENT,Thus all the gentry said good-bye to the Monk with prayers and promises;
3455,ARGUMENT,he was already the other side of the door.
3456,ARGUMENT,
3457,ARGUMENT,Through the window he had caught sight of Thaddeus flying along the
3458,ARGUMENT,"highway, at full gallop, without his hat, with head bent forward, and with"
3459,ARGUMENT,"a pale, gloomy face, continually whipping and spurring on his horse. This"
3460,ARGUMENT,sight greatly disturbed the Bernardine; so he hastened with quick steps
3461,ARGUMENT,"after the young man, towards the great forest, which, as far as the eye"
3462,ARGUMENT,"could reach, showed black along the entire horizon."
3463,ARGUMENT,
3464,ARGUMENT,Who has explored the deep abysses of the Lithuanian forests up to the very
3465,ARGUMENT,"centre, the kernel of the thicket? A fisherman is scarcely acquainted with"
3466,ARGUMENT,the bottom of the sea close to the shore; a huntsman skirts around the bed
3467,ARGUMENT,"of the Lithuanian forests; he knows them barely on the surface, their form"
3468,ARGUMENT,"and face, but the inner secrets of their heart are a mystery to him; only"
3469,ARGUMENT,"rumour or fable knows what goes on within them. For, when you have passed"
3470,ARGUMENT,"the woods and the dense, tangled thickets, in the depths you come upon a"
3471,ARGUMENT,"great rampart of stumps, logs, and roots, defended by a quagmire, a"
3472,ARGUMENT,"thousand streams, and a net of overgrown weeds and ant-hills, nests of"
3473,ARGUMENT,"wasps and hornets, and coils of serpents. If by some superhuman valour you"
3474,ARGUMENT,"surmount even these barriers, farther on you will meet with still greater"
3475,ARGUMENT,"danger. At each step there lie in wait for you, like the dens of wolves,"
3476,ARGUMENT,"little lakes, half overgrown with grass, so deep that men cannot find"
3477,ARGUMENT,their bottom; in them it is very probable that devils dwell. The water of
3478,ARGUMENT,"these wells is iridescent, spotted with a bloody rust, and from within"
3479,ARGUMENT,"continually rises a steam that breathes forth a nasty odour, from which"
3480,ARGUMENT,"the trees around lose their bark and leaves; bald, dwarfed, wormlike, and"
3481,ARGUMENT,"sick, hanging their branches knotted together with moss, and with humped"
3482,ARGUMENT,"trunks bearded with filthy fungi, they sit around the water, like a group"
3483,ARGUMENT,of witches warming themselves around a kettle in which they are boiling a
3484,ARGUMENT,corpse.
3485,ARGUMENT,
3486,ARGUMENT,"Beyond these pools it is vain to try to penetrate even with the eye, to"
3487,ARGUMENT,"say nothing of one's steps, for there all is covered with a misty cloud"
3488,ARGUMENT,that rises incessantly from quivering morasses. But finally behind this
3489,ARGUMENT,"mist (so runs the common rumour) extends a very fair and fertile region,"
3490,ARGUMENT,the main capital of the kingdom of beasts and plants. In it are gathered
3491,ARGUMENT,"the seeds of all trees and herbs, from which their varieties spread abroad"
3492,ARGUMENT,"throughout the world; in it, as in Noah's ark, of all the kinds of beasts"
3493,ARGUMENT,"there is preserved at least one pair for breeding. In the very centre, we"
3494,ARGUMENT,"are told, the ancient buffalo and the bison and the bear, the emperors of"
3495,ARGUMENT,"the forest, hold their court. Around them, on trees, nest the swift lynx"
3496,ARGUMENT,"and the greedy wolverene, as watchful ministers; but farther on, as"
3497,ARGUMENT,"subordinate, noble vassals, dwell wild boars, wolves, and horned elks."
3498,ARGUMENT,"Above their heads are the falcons and wild eagles, who live from the"
3499,ARGUMENT,"lords' tables, as court parasites. These chief and patriarchal pairs of"
3500,ARGUMENT,"beasts, hidden in the kernel of the forest, invisible to the world, send"
3501,ARGUMENT,"their children beyond the confines of the wood as colonists, but"
3502,ARGUMENT,themselves in their capital enjoy repose; they never perish by cut or by
3503,ARGUMENT,"shot, but when old die by a natural death. They have likewise their"
3504,ARGUMENT,"graveyard, where, when near to death, the birds lay their feathers and the"
3505,ARGUMENT,"quadrupeds their fur. The bear, when with his blunted teeth he cannot chew"
3506,ARGUMENT,"his food; the decrepit stag, when he can scarcely move his legs; the"
3507,ARGUMENT,"venerable hare, when his blood already thickens in his veins; the raven,"
3508,ARGUMENT,"when he grows grey, and the falcon, when he grows blind; the eagle, when"
3509,ARGUMENT,his old beak is bent into such a bow that it is shut for ever and provides
3510,ARGUMENT,no nourishment for his throat;83 all go to the graveyard. Even a lesser
3511,ARGUMENT,"beast, when wounded or sick, runs to die in the land of its fathers. Hence"
3512,ARGUMENT,"in the accessible places, to which man resorts, there are never found the"
3513,ARGUMENT,bones of dead animals.84 It is said that there in the capital the beasts
3514,ARGUMENT,"lead a well-ordered life, for they govern themselves; not yet corrupted by"
3515,ARGUMENT,"human civilisation, they know no rights of property, which embroil our"
3516,ARGUMENT,world; they know neither duels nor the art of war. As their fathers lived
3517,ARGUMENT,"in paradise, so their descendants live to-day, wild and tame alike, in"
3518,ARGUMENT,love and harmony; never does one bite or butt another. Even if a man
3519,ARGUMENT,"should enter there, though unarmed, he would pass in peace through the"
3520,ARGUMENT,midst of the beasts; they would gaze on him with the same look of
3521,ARGUMENT,"amazement with which on that last, sixth day of creation their first"
3522,ARGUMENT,"fathers, who dwelt in the Garden of Eden, gazed upon Adam, before they"
3523,ARGUMENT,"quarrelled with him. Happily no man wanders into this enclosure, for Toil"
3524,ARGUMENT,and Terror and Death forbid him access.
3525,ARGUMENT,
3526,ARGUMENT,"Only sometimes hounds, furious in pursuit, entering incautiously among"
3527,ARGUMENT,"these mossy swamps and pits, overwhelmed by the sight of the horrors"
3528,ARGUMENT,"within them, flee away, whining, with looks of terror; and long after,"
3529,ARGUMENT,"though petted by their master's hand, they still tremble at his feet,"
3530,ARGUMENT,"possessed by fright. These ancient hidden places of the forests, unknown"
3531,ARGUMENT,"to men, are called in hunter's language _jungles_."
3532,ARGUMENT,
3533,ARGUMENT,"Stupid bear! If thou hadst abode in the jungle, never would the Seneschal"
3534,ARGUMENT,"have learned of thee; but, whether the fragrance of the honeycomb lured"
3535,ARGUMENT,"thee, or thou feltest too great a longing for ripe oats, thou earnest out"
3536,ARGUMENT,"to the edge of the forest, where the trees were less dense, and there at"
3537,ARGUMENT,"once the forester detected thy presence, and at once sent forth beaters,"
3538,ARGUMENT,"clever spies, to learn where thou wast feeding and where thou hadst thy"
3539,ARGUMENT,"lair by night. Now the Seneschal with his beaters, extending his lines"
3540,ARGUMENT,"between thee and the jungle, cuts off thy retreat."
3541,ARGUMENT,
3542,ARGUMENT,Thaddeus learned that no short time had already passed since the hounds
3543,ARGUMENT,had entered into the abyss of the forest.
3544,ARGUMENT,
3545,ARGUMENT,"All is quiet--in vain the hunters strain their ears; in vain, as to the"
3546,ARGUMENT,"most curious discourse, each hearkens to the silence, and waits long in"
3547,ARGUMENT,his position without moving; only the music of the forest plays to them
3548,ARGUMENT,from afar. The dogs dive through the forest as loons beneath the sea; but
3549,ARGUMENT,"the sportsmen, turning their double-barrelled muskets towards the wood,"
3550,ARGUMENT,"gaze on the Seneschal. He kneels, and questions the earth with his ear. As"
3551,ARGUMENT,in the face of a physician the eyes of friends read the sentence of life
3552,ARGUMENT,"or death for one who is dear to them, so the sportsmen, confident in the"
3553,ARGUMENT,"Seneschal's skill and training, fix upon him glances of hope and terror."
3554,ARGUMENT,"""They are on the track!"" he said in a low voice, and rose to his feet. He"
3555,ARGUMENT,had heard it! They were still listening--finally they too hear; one dog
3556,ARGUMENT,"yelps, then two, twenty, all the hounds at once in a scattered pack catch"
3557,ARGUMENT,the scent and whine; they have struck the trail and howl and bay. This is
3558,ARGUMENT,"not the slow baying of dogs that chase a hare, a fox, or a deer, but a"
3559,ARGUMENT,"constant, sharp yelp, quick, broken, and furious. So the hounds have"
3560,ARGUMENT,"struck no distant trail, the beast is before their eyes--suddenly the cry"
3561,ARGUMENT,"of the pursuit stops, they have reached the beast--again there is yelping"
3562,ARGUMENT,"and snarling--the beast is defending himself, and is undoubtedly maiming"
3563,ARGUMENT,some of them; amid the baying of the hounds one hears more and more often
3564,ARGUMENT,the howl of a dying dog.
3565,ARGUMENT,
3566,ARGUMENT,"The hunters stood still, and each of them, with his gun ready, bent"
3567,ARGUMENT,forward like a bow with his head thrust into the forest; they could wait
3568,ARGUMENT,no longer! Already one after another left his station and crowded into the
3569,ARGUMENT,thicket; each wished to be the first to meet the beast; though the
3570,ARGUMENT,"Seneschal kept cautioning them, though the Seneschal rode to each station"
3571,ARGUMENT,"on his horse, crying that whoever should leave his place, be he simple"
3572,ARGUMENT,"peasant or gentleman's son, should get the lash upon his back. There"
3573,ARGUMENT,"was-no help for it! All, against orders, ran into the wood. three guns"
3574,ARGUMENT,"sounded at once, then a continual cannonade, until, louder than the"
3575,ARGUMENT,"reports, the bear roared and filled with echoes all the forest. A dreadful"
3576,ARGUMENT,"roar, of pain, fury, and despair! After it the yelping of the dogs, the"
3577,ARGUMENT,"cries of the sportsmen, the horns of the beaters thundered from the centre"
3578,ARGUMENT,"of the thicket. Some hunters hasten into the forest, others cock their"
3579,ARGUMENT,"guns, and all rejoice. Only the Seneschal in grief cries that they have"
3580,ARGUMENT,"missed him. The sportsmen and the beaters had all gone to the same side,"
3581,ARGUMENT,"between the toils and the forest, to cut off the beast; but the bear,"
3582,ARGUMENT,"frightened by the throng of dogs and men, turned back into places less"
3583,ARGUMENT,"carefully guarded, towards the fields, whence the sportsmen set to guard"
3584,ARGUMENT,"them had departed, where of the many ranks of hunters there remained only"
3585,ARGUMENT,"the Seneschal, Thaddeus, the Count, and a few beaters."
3586,ARGUMENT,
3587,ARGUMENT,"Here the wood was thinner; from within could be heard a roaring, and the"
3588,ARGUMENT,"crackling of breaking boughs, until finally the bear darted from the dense"
3589,ARGUMENT,forest like a thunderbolt from the clouds. From all sides the dogs were
3590,ARGUMENT,"chasing him, terrifying him, tearing him, until at last he rose on his"
3591,ARGUMENT,"hind legs and looked around, frightening his enemies with a roar; with his"
3592,ARGUMENT,"fore paws he tore up now the roots of a tree, now charred stumps, now"
3593,ARGUMENT,"stones that had grown into the earth, hurling them at dogs and men;"
3594,ARGUMENT,"finally he broke down a tree, and brandishing it like a club to the right"
3595,ARGUMENT,"and the left, he rushed straight at the last guardians of the line of"
3596,ARGUMENT,"beaters, at the Count and Thaddeus. They stood their ground unafraid, and"
3597,ARGUMENT,"levelled the barrels of their muskets at the beast, like two"
3598,ARGUMENT,lightning-rods at the bosom of a dark cloud; then both at once pulled
3599,ARGUMENT,their triggers (inexperienced lads!) and the guns thundered together: they
3600,ARGUMENT,missed. The bear leapt towards them; they seized with four hands a pike
3601,ARGUMENT,"that had been stuck in the earth, and each pulled it towards him; they"
3602,ARGUMENT,"gazed at the bear till two rows of tusks glittered from a great red mouth,"
3603,ARGUMENT,and a paw armed with claws was already descending on their brows. They
3604,ARGUMENT,"turned pale, jumped back, and slipped away to where the trees were less"
3605,ARGUMENT,"dense. The beast reared up behind them, already he was making a slash with"
3606,ARGUMENT,"his claws; but he missed, ran on, reared up again aloft, and with his"
3607,ARGUMENT,black paw aimed at the Count's yellow hair. He would have torn his skull
3608,ARGUMENT,"from his brains as a hat from the head, but just then the Assessor and the"
3609,ARGUMENT,"Notary jumped out from either side, and Gerwazy came running up some"
3610,ARGUMENT,"hundred paces away in front, and after him Robak, though without a gun--and"
3611,ARGUMENT,the three shot together at the same instant. as though at a word of
3612,ARGUMENT,"command. The bear leapt into the air. like a hare before the hounds, came"
3613,ARGUMENT,"down upon his head, and turning a somersault with his four paws, and"
3614,ARGUMENT,"throwing the bloody weight of his huge body right under the Count, hurled"
3615,ARGUMENT,"him from his feet to the earth; he still roared, and tried to rise, when"
3616,ARGUMENT,the furious Strapczyna and the ferocious Sprawnik descended on him.
3617,ARGUMENT,
3618,ARGUMENT,"Then the Seneschal seized his buffalo horn, which hung by a strap, long,"
3619,ARGUMENT,"spotted, and crooked as a boa constrictor, and with both hands pressed it"
3620,ARGUMENT,"to his lips. He blew up his cheeks like a balloon, his eyes became"
3621,ARGUMENT,"bloodshot, he half-lowered his eyelids, drew his belly into half its size,"
3622,ARGUMENT,"sending thence into his lungs his entire supply of breath, and began to"
3623,ARGUMENT,"play. The horn, like a cyclone with a whirling breath, bore the music into"
3624,ARGUMENT,"the forest and an echo repeated it. The sportsmen became silent, the"
3625,ARGUMENT,"hunters were amazed by the power, purity, and marvellous harmony of the"
3626,ARGUMENT,notes. The old man was once more exhibiting before an audience of huntsmen
3627,ARGUMENT,all that art for which he had once been famous in the forests; straightway
3628,ARGUMENT,he filled and made alive the woods and groves as though he had led into
3629,ARGUMENT,them a whole kennel and had begun the hunt. For in the playing there was a
3630,ARGUMENT,"short history of the hunt. First there was a ringing, brisk summons--that"
3631,ARGUMENT,was the morning call; then yelp upon yelp whined forth--that was the baying
3632,ARGUMENT,of the dogs; and here and there was a harsher tone like thunder--that was
3633,ARGUMENT,the shooting.
3634,ARGUMENT,
3635,ARGUMENT,"Here he broke off, but he still held the horn. It seemed to all that the"
3636,ARGUMENT,"Seneschal was still playing on, but that was the echo playing."
3637,ARGUMENT,
3638,ARGUMENT,"He began once more. You might think that the horn was changing its form,"
3639,ARGUMENT,"and that in the Seneschal's lips it grew now thicker and now thinner,"
3640,ARGUMENT,"imitating the cries of animals; once, prolonging itself into a wolf's"
3641,ARGUMENT,"neck, it howled long and piercingly; again, as if broadening into a bear's"
3642,ARGUMENT,"throat, it roared; then the bellowing of a bison cut the wind."
3643,ARGUMENT,
3644,ARGUMENT,"Here he broke off, but he still held the horn. It seemed to all that the"
3645,ARGUMENT,"Seneschal was still playing on, but that was the echo playing. Hearing"
3646,ARGUMENT,"this masterpiece of horn music, the oaks repeated it to the oaks and the"
3647,ARGUMENT,beeches to the beeches.
3648,ARGUMENT,
3649,ARGUMENT,He blew again. In the horn there seemed to be a hundred horns; one could
3650,ARGUMENT,"hear mingled outcries of setting on the dogs, wrath and terror of the"
3651,ARGUMENT,"hunters, the pack, and the beasts: finally the Seneschal raised his horn"
3652,ARGUMENT,"aloft, and a hymn of triumph smote the clouds."
3653,ARGUMENT,
3654,ARGUMENT,"Here he broke off, but he still held the horn. It seemed to all that the"
3655,ARGUMENT,"Seneschal was still playing on, but that was the echo playing. In the wood"
3656,ARGUMENT,there seemed to be a horn for every tree; one repeated the song to
3657,ARGUMENT,"another, as though it spread from choir to choir. And the music went on,"
3658,ARGUMENT,"ever broader, ever farther, ever more gentle, and ever more pure and"
3659,ARGUMENT,"perfect, until it died away somewhere far off, somewhere on the threshold"
3660,ARGUMENT,of the heavens!
3661,ARGUMENT,
3662,ARGUMENT,"The Seneschal, taking both hands from the horn, spread them out like a"
3663,ARGUMENT,"cross; the horn fell, and swung on his leather belt. The Seneschal, his"
3664,ARGUMENT,"face swollen and shining, and his eyes uplifted, stood as if inspired,"
3665,ARGUMENT,catching with his ear the last expiring tones. But meanwhile thousands of
3666,ARGUMENT,"plaudits thundered forth, thousands of congratulations and shouts of"
3667,ARGUMENT,vivat.
3668,ARGUMENT,
3669,ARGUMENT,"They gradually became quiet, and the eyes of the throng were turned on the"
3670,ARGUMENT,"huge, fresh corpse of the bear. He lay besprinkled with blood and pierced"
3671,ARGUMENT,"with bullets; his breast was plunged into the thick, matted grass; his"
3672,ARGUMENT,"paws were spread out before him like a cross; he still breathed, but he"
3673,ARGUMENT,poured forth a stream of blood through his nostrils; his eyes were still
3674,ARGUMENT,"open, but he did not move his head. The Chamberlain's bulldogs held him"
3675,ARGUMENT,"beneath the ears; on the left side hung Strapczyna; on the right Sprawnik,"
3676,ARGUMENT,"choking his throat, sucked out the black blood."
3677,ARGUMENT,
3678,ARGUMENT,Thereupon the Seneschal bade place an iron bar between the teeth of the
3679,ARGUMENT,"dogs, and thus open their jaws. With the butts of their guns they turned"
3680,ARGUMENT,"the remains of the beast on its back, and again a triple vivat smote the"
3681,ARGUMENT,clouds.
3682,ARGUMENT,
3683,ARGUMENT,"""Well?"" cried the Assessor, flourishing the barrel of his musket; ""well?"
3684,ARGUMENT,"how about my little gun? It aims high, does it! Well? how about my little"
3685,ARGUMENT,"gun? It is not a large birdie,85 but what a showing it made! That is no"
3686,ARGUMENT,new thing for it either; it never wastes a charge upon the air. It was a
3687,ARGUMENT,"present to me from Prince Sanguszko."""
3688,ARGUMENT,
3689,ARGUMENT,"Here he showed a musket which, though small, was of marvellous"
3690,ARGUMENT,"workmanship, and began to enumerate its virtues."
3691,ARGUMENT,
3692,ARGUMENT,"""I was running,"" interrupted the Notary, wiping the sweat from his brow,"
3693,ARGUMENT,"""I was running right after the bear; but the Seneschal called out, 'Stay"
3694,ARGUMENT,in your places!' How could I stay there; the bear was making full speed
3695,ARGUMENT,"for the fields, like a hare, farther and farther; finally I lost my breath"
3696,ARGUMENT,and had no hope of catching up; then I looked to the right: he was
3697,ARGUMENT,"standing right there, and the trees were not dense. When I aimed at him, I"
3698,ARGUMENT,"thought, 'Hold on, Bruin!' and sure enough, there he lies dead. It's a"
3699,ARGUMENT,"fine gun, a real Sagalas; there is the inscription, _Sagalas, London à"
3700,ARGUMENT,"Balabanowka_."" (A famous Polish smith lived there, who made Polish guns,"
3701,ARGUMENT,but decorated them in English fashion.)
3702,ARGUMENT,
3703,ARGUMENT,"""How's that?"" snorted the Assessor, ""in the name of a thousand bears! The"
3704,ARGUMENT,"idea of your killing it! What rubbish are you talking?"""
3705,ARGUMENT,
3706,ARGUMENT,"""Listen,"" replied the Notary, ""this is no court investigation; this is a"
3707,ARGUMENT,"hunting party; we will summon all as witnesses."""
3708,ARGUMENT,
3709,ARGUMENT,"So a furious brawl arose in the company, some taking the side of the"
3710,ARGUMENT,"Assessor and some that of the Notary. No one remembered about Gerwazy, for"
3711,ARGUMENT,"all had run in from the sides, and had not noticed what was going on in"
3712,ARGUMENT,front. The Seneschal took the floor:--
3713,ARGUMENT,
3714,ARGUMENT,"""Now at all events there is some reason for a quarrel, for this,"
3715,ARGUMENT,"gentlemen, is no worthless rabbit; this is a bear: here one need have no"
3716,ARGUMENT,"compunctions about seeking satisfaction, whether it be with the sabre or"
3717,ARGUMENT,"even with pistols. It is hard to reconcile your dispute, so according to"
3718,ARGUMENT,the ancient custom we give you our permission for a duel. I remember that
3719,ARGUMENT,"in my time there lived two neighbours, both worthy gentlemen, and of long"
3720,ARGUMENT,descent; they dwelt on opposite sides of the river Wilejka; one was named
3721,ARGUMENT,Domejko and the other Dowejko.86 They both shot at the same time at a
3722,ARGUMENT,"she-bear; which killed it it was hard to ascertain, and they had a"
3723,ARGUMENT,"terrible quarrel, and swore to shoot at each other over the hide of the"
3724,ARGUMENT,"bear: that was in true gentleman's style, almost barrel to barrel. This"
3725,ARGUMENT,"duel made a great stir, and in those days they sang songs about it. I was"
3726,ARGUMENT,their second; how everything came to pass--I will tell you the whole story
3727,ARGUMENT,"from the beginning."""
3728,ARGUMENT,
3729,ARGUMENT,"Before the Seneschal began to speak, Gerwazy had settled the dispute. He"
3730,ARGUMENT,"walked attentively around the bear; finally he drew his hanger, cut the"
3731,ARGUMENT,"snout in two, and in the rear of the head, opening the layers of the"
3732,ARGUMENT,"brain, he found the bullet. He took it out, wiped it on his coat, measured"
3733,ARGUMENT,"it with a cartridge, applied it to the barrel of his flintlock, and then"
3734,ARGUMENT,"said, raising his palm with the bullet resting upon it:--"
3735,ARGUMENT,
3736,ARGUMENT,"""Gentlemen, this bullet is not from either of your weapons; it came from"
3737,ARGUMENT,"this single-barrelled Horeszko carbine."" (Here he raised an old flintlock,"
3738,ARGUMENT,"tied up with strings.) ""But I did not shoot it. O, how much daring was"
3739,ARGUMENT,needed then! it is terrible to remember it; my eyes grew dark! For both
3740,ARGUMENT,"the young gentlemen were running straight towards me, and behind them was"
3741,ARGUMENT,"the bear--just, just above the head of the Count, the last of the"
3742,ARGUMENT,"Horeszkos, though in the female line! 'Jesus Maria!' I exclaimed, and the"
3743,ARGUMENT,angels of the Lord sent to my aid the Bernardine Monk. He put us all to
3744,ARGUMENT,"shame; O, he is a glorious monk! While I trembled, while I dared not touch"
3745,ARGUMENT,"the trigger, he snatched the musket from my hands, aimed, and fired. To"
3746,ARGUMENT,shoot between two heads! at a hundred paces! and not to miss! and in the
3747,ARGUMENT,"very centre of his jaw! to knock out his teeth so! Gentlemen, long have I"
3748,ARGUMENT,"lived, and but one man have I seen who could boast himself such a"
3749,ARGUMENT,"marksman: that man once famous among us for so many duels, who used to"
3750,ARGUMENT,"shoot out the heels from under women's shoes, that scoundrel of"
3751,ARGUMENT,"scoundrels, renowned in memorable times, that Jacek, commonly called"
3752,ARGUMENT,Mustachio; his surname I will not mention. But now it is no time for him
3753,ARGUMENT,to be hunting bears; that ruffian is certainly buried in Hell up to his
3754,ARGUMENT,"very mustaches. Glory to the Monk, he has saved the lives of two men, and"
3755,ARGUMENT,"perhaps of three. Gerwazy will not boast, but if the last child of the"
3756,ARGUMENT,"Horeszkos' blood had fallen into the jaws of the beast, I should no longer"
3757,ARGUMENT,"be in this world, and perhaps the bear would have gnawed clean my old"
3758,ARGUMENT,"bones. Come, Father Monk, let us drink your good health!"""
3759,ARGUMENT,
3760,ARGUMENT,In vain they searched for the Monk: all that they could discover was that
3761,ARGUMENT,"after the killing of the beast he had appeared for a moment, had leapt"
3762,ARGUMENT,"towards the Count and Thaddeus, and, seeing that both were safe and sound,"
3763,ARGUMENT,"had raised his eyes to Heaven, quietly repeated a prayer, and had run"
3764,ARGUMENT,"quickly into the field, as though some one were chasing him."
3765,ARGUMENT,
3766,ARGUMENT,Meanwhile at the Seneschal's bidding they had thrown into a heap bundles
3767,ARGUMENT,"of heather, dry brushwood, and logs; the fire burst forth, and a grey pine"
3768,ARGUMENT,tree of smoke grew up and spread out aloft like a canopy. Over the flame
3769,ARGUMENT,they joined pikes into a tripod; on the spears they hung big-bellied
3770,ARGUMENT,"kettles; from the waggons they brought vegetables, meal, roast meats, and"
3771,ARGUMENT,bread.
3772,ARGUMENT,
3773,ARGUMENT,"The Judge opened a locked liquor case, in which there could be seen rows"
3774,ARGUMENT,of white necks of bottles; from among them he took the largest crystal
3775,ARGUMENT,"decanter--this the Judge had received as a gift from the Monk, Robak. It"
3776,ARGUMENT,"was Dantzic brandy, a drink dear to a Pole. ""Long live Dantzic!"" cried the"
3777,ARGUMENT,"Judge, raising the flask on high; ""the city once was ours, and it will be"
3778,ARGUMENT,"ours again!"" And he filled each glass with the silvery liquor, until at"
3779,ARGUMENT,last it began to drip golden and glitter in the sun.87
3780,ARGUMENT,
3781,ARGUMENT,In the kettles they were cooking _bigos_.88 In words it is hard to express
3782,ARGUMENT,the wonderful taste and colour of bigos and its marvellous odour; in a
3783,ARGUMENT,"description of it one hears only the clinking words and the regular rimes,"
3784,ARGUMENT,but no city stomach can understand their content. In order to appreciate
3785,ARGUMENT,"Lithuanian songs and dishes, one must have health, must live in the"
3786,ARGUMENT,"country, and must be returning from a hunting party."
3787,ARGUMENT,
3788,ARGUMENT,"However, even without these sauces, bigos is no ordinary dish, for it is"
3789,ARGUMENT,"artistically composed of good vegetables. The foundation of it is sliced,"
3790,ARGUMENT,"sour cabbage, which, as the saying is, goes into the mouth of itself;"
3791,ARGUMENT,"this, enclosed in a kettle, covers with its moist bosom the best parts of"
3792,ARGUMENT,"selected meat, and is parboiled, until the fire extracts from it all the"
3793,ARGUMENT,"living juices, and until the fluid boils over the edge of the pot, and the"
3794,ARGUMENT,very air around is fragrant with the aroma.
3795,ARGUMENT,
3796,ARGUMENT,"The bigos was soon ready. The huntsmen with a thrice-repeated vivat, armed"
3797,ARGUMENT,"with spoons, ran up and assailed the kettle; the copper rang, the vapour"
3798,ARGUMENT,"burst forth, the bigos evaporated like camphor, it vanished and flew away;"
3799,ARGUMENT,"only in the jaws of the caldrons the steam still seethed, as in the"
3800,ARGUMENT,craters of extinct volcanoes.
3801,ARGUMENT,
3802,ARGUMENT,"When they had eaten and drunk their fill, they put the beast on a waggon,"
3803,ARGUMENT,"and themselves mounted their steeds. All were gay and talkative, except"
3804,ARGUMENT,"the Assessor and the Notary, who were more testy than the day before,"
3805,ARGUMENT,quarrelling over the merits of that Sanguszko gun and that Sagalas musket
3806,ARGUMENT,"from Balabanowka. The Count and Thaddeus also rode on in no merry mood,"
3807,ARGUMENT,being ashamed that they had missed and had retreated; for in Lithuania
3808,ARGUMENT,whoever lets a bear get through the circle of beaters must toil long
3809,ARGUMENT,before he repairs his fame.
3810,ARGUMENT,
3811,ARGUMENT,"The Count said that he had reached the pike first, and that Thaddeus had"
3812,ARGUMENT,"hindered him from encountering the beast; Thaddeus maintained that, being"
3813,ARGUMENT,"the stronger, and the more skilful in work with a heavy pike, he had"
3814,ARGUMENT,wished to relieve the Count of the trouble. Such nipping words they said
3815,ARGUMENT,"to each other, now and again, in the midst of the cries and uproar of the"
3816,ARGUMENT,train.
3817,ARGUMENT,
3818,ARGUMENT,The Seneschal was riding in the middle; the worthy old man was merry
3819,ARGUMENT,beyond his wont and very talkative. Wishing to amuse the quarrelsome
3820,ARGUMENT,"hunters and to bring them to an agreement, for their benefit he concluded"
3821,ARGUMENT,his story of Dowejko and Domejko:--
3822,ARGUMENT,
3823,ARGUMENT,"""Assessor, if I wanted you to fight a duel with the Notary, don't think"
3824,ARGUMENT,"that I thirst for human blood; God forbid! I wanted to amuse you, I"
3825,ARGUMENT,"wanted, so to speak, to arrange a comedy for you, to renew a conceit that"
3826,ARGUMENT,"I invented forty years ago, a splendid one! You are younger men, and do"
3827,ARGUMENT,"not remember about it, but in my time it was famous from this forest to"
3828,ARGUMENT,the woods of Polesie.
3829,ARGUMENT,
3830,ARGUMENT,"""All the animosities of Domejko and Dowejko proceeded, strange to say,"
3831,ARGUMENT,"from the very unfortunate similarity of their names. For when, at the time"
3832,ARGUMENT,"of the district diets,89 the friends of Dowejko were recruiting partisans,"
3833,ARGUMENT,"some one would whisper to a gentleman, 'Give your vote to Dowejko'; but"
3834,ARGUMENT,"he, not hearing quite correctly, would give his vote to Domejko. Once"
3835,ARGUMENT,"when, at a banquet, the Marshal Rupejko proposed a toast, 'Vivat Dowejko,'"
3836,ARGUMENT,others shouted 'Domejko'; and the guests sitting in the middle did not
3837,ARGUMENT,"know what to do, especially considering one's indistinct speech at dinner"
3838,ARGUMENT,time.
3839,ARGUMENT,
3840,ARGUMENT,"""That was not the worst: once a certain drunken squire had a sword fight"
3841,ARGUMENT,"in Wilno with Domejko and received two wounds; later that squire,"
3842,ARGUMENT,"returning home from Wilno, by a strange chance took the same boat as"
3843,ARGUMENT,"Dowejko. So, when they were journeying along the Wilejka in the same boat,"
3844,ARGUMENT,"and he asked his neighbour who he was, the reply was 'Dowejko.' Without"
3845,ARGUMENT,"further ado he drew his blade from under his winter coat; slash, slash,"
3846,ARGUMENT,and on Domejko's account he cut off the mustache of Dowejko.
3847,ARGUMENT,
3848,ARGUMENT,"""Finally, as the last straw, it must needs be that on a hunting party"
3849,ARGUMENT,things happened thus. The two men of the name were standing near each
3850,ARGUMENT,"other, and both shot at the same time at the same she-bear. To be sure,"
3851,ARGUMENT,"immediately after their shots it did fall lifeless, but before that it had"
3852,ARGUMENT,been carrying a dozen bullets in its belly. Many persons had guns of the
3853,ARGUMENT,same calibre. Who killed the bear? Try to find out! How can you tell?
3854,ARGUMENT,
3855,ARGUMENT,"""Here they shouted: 'Enough! We must end this matter once for all. Whether"
3856,ARGUMENT,"God or the devil united us, we must separate; two of us, like two suns,"
3857,ARGUMENT,seem to be too much for one world.' And so they drew their sabres and took
3858,ARGUMENT,their positions. Both were worthy men; the more the other gentry tried to
3859,ARGUMENT,"reconcile them, the more furiously they let fly at each other. They"
3860,ARGUMENT,changed their arms; from sabres they passed to pistols; they took their
3861,ARGUMENT,"positions, we cried that they had put the barriers too near together."
3862,ARGUMENT,"They, to spite us, swore to shoot over the skin of the bear, sure death!"
3863,ARGUMENT,almost barrel to barrel; both were fine shots. 'Let Hreczecha be our
3864,ARGUMENT,"second.' 'All right,' I said, 'let the sexton dig a hole at once, for such"
3865,ARGUMENT,"a dispute cannot end without results. But fight like gentlemen, and not"
3866,ARGUMENT,"like butchers. It is well enough to shorten the distance, I see that you"
3867,ARGUMENT,are bold fellows; but do you want to shoot with your pistols on each
3868,ARGUMENT,"other's bellies? I will not permit it; I agree to pistols, but you shall"
3869,ARGUMENT,shoot from a distance neither longer nor shorter than across the bear's
3870,ARGUMENT,hide; with my own hands as second I will stretch the hide of the bear on
3871,ARGUMENT,"the ground, and I myself will station you. You shall stand on one side, at"
3872,ARGUMENT,"the end of the snout, and you at the tail.'--'Agreed,' they shouted; 'the"
3873,ARGUMENT,time?'--'To-morrow.'--'The place?'--'The Usza tavern.'--They parted. But I set
3874,ARGUMENT,"to reading Virgil."""
3875,ARGUMENT,
3876,ARGUMENT,"Here the Seneschal was interrupted by a cry of ""At him!"" Right from under"
3877,ARGUMENT,the horses a hare had darted out; first Bobtail and then Falcon started
3878,ARGUMENT,"after it. They had taken the greyhounds to the hunt, knowing that as they"
3879,ARGUMENT,returned through the fields they might very likely happen on a rabbit.
3880,ARGUMENT,They were walking without leashes alongside the horses; when they caught
3881,ARGUMENT,"sight of the hare, before the hunters could urge them on they started"
3882,ARGUMENT,"after it. The Notary and the Assessor wanted to follow on horseback, but"
3883,ARGUMENT,"the Seneschal checked them, saying; ""Hold! stand and watch! I will not"
3884,ARGUMENT,permit a person to stir from the spot. From here we can all see well how
3885,ARGUMENT,"the hare runs for the field."" In very truth, the hare felt behind it the"
3886,ARGUMENT,hunters and the pack; it was making for the field; it stretched out behind
3887,ARGUMENT,it its ears like two deer's horns; it showed like a long grey streak
3888,ARGUMENT,extended above the ploughed land; beneath it its legs stuck out like four
3889,ARGUMENT,"rods; you would have said that it did not move them, but only tapped the"
3890,ARGUMENT,"earth on the surface, like a swallow kissing the water. Behind it was"
3891,ARGUMENT,"dust, behind the dust the dogs; from a distance it seemed that the hare,"
3892,ARGUMENT,"the dust, and the dogs blended into one body, as though some great serpent"
3893,ARGUMENT,"were winding over the plain; the hare was the head, the dust in the rear"
3894,ARGUMENT,"was like a dark blue neck, and the dogs seemed to form a restless double"
3895,ARGUMENT,tail.
3896,ARGUMENT,
3897,ARGUMENT,"The Notary and the Assessor gazed with open mouths, and held their breath."
3898,ARGUMENT,Suddenly the Notary grew pale as a handkerchief; the Assessor grew pale
3899,ARGUMENT,too: they saw--something fatal was happening; the farther that serpent
3900,ARGUMENT,"went, the longer it became; it was already breaking in half; already that"
3901,ARGUMENT,"neck of dust had vanished; the head was already near the wood, and the"
3902,ARGUMENT,tails somewhere behind! The head disappeared; for one last instant some
3903,ARGUMENT,"one seemed to wave a tassel; it was lost in the wood, and near the wood"
3904,ARGUMENT,the tail broke up.
3905,ARGUMENT,
3906,ARGUMENT,The poor dogs ran bewildered along the border; they seemed to offer each
3907,ARGUMENT,"other mutual advice and accusations. Finally they came back, slowly"
3908,ARGUMENT,"bounding over the furrows, with drooping ears and tails between their"
3909,ARGUMENT,"legs; and, running up, for very shame they did not dare to lift their"
3910,ARGUMENT,"eyes; and, instead of going to their masters, they stopped on one side."
3911,ARGUMENT,
3912,ARGUMENT,The Notary drooped his gloomy brow towards his breast; the Assessor
3913,ARGUMENT,"glanced around, but in no merry mood. Then they began to explain to the"
3914,ARGUMENT,"audience how their greyhounds were not used to going without leashes, how"
3915,ARGUMENT,"the hare had started out suddenly, how it was a poor chase over the"
3916,ARGUMENT,"ploughed field, where the dogs ought to have had boots, it was all so"
3917,ARGUMENT,covered with flints and sharp stones.
3918,ARGUMENT,
3919,ARGUMENT,"They learnedly elucidated the matter, as experienced masters of hounds;"
3920,ARGUMENT,"from their words the hunters might have profited greatly, but they did not"
3921,ARGUMENT,"listen attentively; some began to whistle, others to titter; others,"
3922,ARGUMENT,"remembering the bear, talked about that, being still occupied by the"
3923,ARGUMENT,recent hunt.
3924,ARGUMENT,
3925,ARGUMENT,The Seneschal had hardly once glanced at the hare: seeing that it had
3926,ARGUMENT,"escaped, he indifferently turned his head and finished his interrupted"
3927,ARGUMENT,discourse:--
3928,ARGUMENT,
3929,ARGUMENT,"""Where did I stop? Aha, at my making them both promise that they would"
3930,ARGUMENT,"shoot across the bear skin! The gentlemen cried out: 'That is sure death,"
3931,ARGUMENT,"almost barrel to barrel!' But I laughed to myself, for my friend Maro had"
3932,ARGUMENT,"taught me that the skin of a beast is no ordinary measure. You know, my"
3933,ARGUMENT,"friends, how Queen Dido sailed to Libya, and there with great trouble"
3934,ARGUMENT,"managed to buy a morsel of land, such as could be covered with a bull's"
3935,ARGUMENT,hide.90 On that tiny morsel of land arose Carthage! So I thought that over
3936,ARGUMENT,attentively by night.
3937,ARGUMENT,
3938,ARGUMENT,"""Hardly was day dawning, when from one side came Dowejko in a gig, and"
3939,ARGUMENT,from the other Domejko on horseback. They beheld that over the river
3940,ARGUMENT,"stretched a shaggy bridge, a girdle of bear skin cut into strips. I"
3941,ARGUMENT,"stationed Dowejko at the tail of the beast on one side, and Domejko on the"
3942,ARGUMENT,"other side. 'Now blaze away,' I said, 'for all your lives if you choose,"
3943,ARGUMENT,"but I won't let you go until you are friends again.' They got furious, but"
3944,ARGUMENT,then the gentry present fairly rolled on the ground for laughter; and the
3945,ARGUMENT,priest and I with impressive words set to giving them lessons from the
3946,ARGUMENT,Gospel and from the Statutes. There was no help for it; they laughed and
3947,ARGUMENT,had to be reconciled.
3948,ARGUMENT,
3949,ARGUMENT,"""Their quarrel turned later into a lifelong friendship, and Dowejko"
3950,ARGUMENT,married the sister of Domejko; Domejko espoused the sister of his
3951,ARGUMENT,"brother-in-law, Panna Dowejko: they divided their property into two equal"
3952,ARGUMENT,"portions, and on the spot where so strange an occurrence had happened they"
3953,ARGUMENT,"built a tavern, and called it the Little Bear."""

3974,ARGUMENT,
3975,ARGUMENT,"The Seneschal, after honourably concluding his hunt, was returning from"
3976,ARGUMENT,"the wood, but Telimena in the depths of the deserted mansion was just"
3977,ARGUMENT,"beginning her hunting. To be sure she sat without moving, with her arms"
3978,ARGUMENT,"folded on her breast, but with her thoughts she was pursuing two beasts;"
3979,ARGUMENT,she was searching for means to invest and capture them both at once--the
3980,ARGUMENT,"Count and Thaddeus. The Count was a young magnate, the heir of a great"
3981,ARGUMENT,"house, handsome and attractive, and already a trifle in love! Well? He"
3982,ARGUMENT,"might be fickle! Then, was he sincerely in love? Would he consent to"
3983,ARGUMENT,marry? especially a woman some years older than he? and not rich?
3984,ARGUMENT,
3985,ARGUMENT,With these thoughts Telimena rose from the sofa and stood on tiptoe; you
3986,ARGUMENT,would have said that she had grown tall. She opened slightly her gown over
3987,ARGUMENT,"her bosom, leaned sideways, surveyed herself with a diligent eye, and"
3988,ARGUMENT,"again asked counsel of her mirror; a moment later, she lowered her eyes,"
3989,ARGUMENT,"sighed, and sat down."
3990,ARGUMENT,
3991,ARGUMENT,The Count was a grandee! Men of property are changeable in their tastes.
3992,ARGUMENT,The Count was a blond! Blonds are not over passionate. But Thaddeus? a
3993,ARGUMENT,simple lad! an honest boy! almost a child! he was beginning to fall in
3994,ARGUMENT,love for the first time! If well looked to he would not easily break his
3995,ARGUMENT,"first ties; besides that, he was already under obligations to Telimena."
3996,ARGUMENT,"While they are young, though men are fickle in their thoughts, they are"
3997,ARGUMENT,"more constant in their feelings than their grandfathers, because they have"
3998,ARGUMENT,a conscience. The simple and maidenlike heart of a youth long preserves
3999,ARGUMENT,gratitude for the first sweets of love! It welcomes enjoyment and bids it
4000,ARGUMENT,"farewell with gaiety, like a modest meal, which we share with a friend."
4001,ARGUMENT,"Only an old drunkard, whose inwards are already burning, loathes the drink"
4002,ARGUMENT,"in which he drowns himself. All this Telimena knew thoroughly, for she had"
4003,ARGUMENT,both sense and large experience.
4004,ARGUMENT,
4005,ARGUMENT,"But what would people say? One could withdraw from their sight, go to"
4006,ARGUMENT,"another locality, live in retirement, or, what was better, remove entirely"
4007,ARGUMENT,"from the vicinity, for instance make a little trip to the capital; she"
4008,ARGUMENT,"might introduce the young lad to the great world, guide his steps, aid"
4009,ARGUMENT,"him, counsel him, form his heart, have in him a counsellor and brother!"
4010,ARGUMENT,"Finally, she might enjoy the world herself, while her years permitted."
4011,ARGUMENT,
4012,ARGUMENT,With these thoughts she walked boldly and gaily several times up and down
4013,ARGUMENT,the chamber--again she lowered her brow.
4014,ARGUMENT,
4015,ARGUMENT,It might be well also to think about the fate of the Count--could she not
4016,ARGUMENT,"manage to interest him in Zosia? She was not rich, but of equal birth to"
4017,ARGUMENT,"his, of a senatorial family, the daughter of a dignitary. If their"
4018,ARGUMENT,"marriage should come to pass, Telimena would have a refuge for the future"
4019,ARGUMENT,"in their home, being kin to Zosia and the one who secured her for the"
4020,ARGUMENT,Count; she would be like a mother for the young couple.
4021,ARGUMENT,
4022,ARGUMENT,"After this decisive consultation, held with herself, she called from the"
4023,ARGUMENT,"window to Zosia, who was playing in the garden."
4024,ARGUMENT,
4025,ARGUMENT,"Zosia was standing bareheaded in her morning gown, holding a sieve aloft"
4026,ARGUMENT,in her hands; the barnyard fowls were running to her feet. From one side
4027,ARGUMENT,the rough-feathered hens came rolling like balls of yarn; from the other
4028,ARGUMENT,"the crested cocks, shaking the coral helms upon their heads and oaring"
4029,ARGUMENT,"themselves with their wings over the furrows and through the bushes,"
4030,ARGUMENT,stretched out broadly their spurred feet; behind them slowly advanced a
4031,ARGUMENT,"puffed-up turkey cock, fretting at the complaints of his garrulous spouse;"
4032,ARGUMENT,"there the peacocks, like rafts, steered themselves over the meadow with"
4033,ARGUMENT,"their long tails, and here and there a silver-winged dove would fall from"
4034,ARGUMENT,on high like a tassel of snow. In the middle of the circle of greensward
4035,ARGUMENT,"extended a noisy, moving circle of birds, girt round with a belt of doves,"
4036,ARGUMENT,"like a white ribbon, mottled with stars, spots, and stripes. Here amber"
4037,ARGUMENT,beaks and there coral crests rose from the thick mass of feathers like
4038,ARGUMENT,fish from the waves. Their necks were thrust forward and with soft
4039,ARGUMENT,movements continually wavered to and fro like water lilies; a thousand
4040,ARGUMENT,eyes like stars glittered upon Zosia.
4041,ARGUMENT,
4042,ARGUMENT,"In the centre, raised high above the birds, white herself, and dressed in"
4043,ARGUMENT,"a long white gown, she turned about like a fountain playing amid flowers."
4044,ARGUMENT,"She took from the sieve and scattered over the wings and heads, with a"
4045,ARGUMENT,"hand white as pearls, a dense pearly hail of barley grains: it was grain"
4046,ARGUMENT,"worthy of a lord's table, and was made for thickening the Lithuanian"
4047,ARGUMENT,broths; by stealing it from the pantry cupboard for her poultry Zosia did
4048,ARGUMENT,damage to the housekeeping.
4049,ARGUMENT,
4050,ARGUMENT,"She heard the call ""Zosia""--that was her aunt's voice! She sprinkled out"
4051,ARGUMENT,"all at once to the birds the remnant of the dainties, and twirling the"
4052,ARGUMENT,"sieve as a dancer a tambourine and beating it rhythmically, the playful"
4053,ARGUMENT,"maiden began to skip over the peacocks, the doves, and the hens. The"
4054,ARGUMENT,"birds, disturbed, fluttered up in a throng. Zosia, hardly touching the"
4055,ARGUMENT,"ground with her feet, seemed to tower high above them; before her the"
4056,ARGUMENT,"white doves, which she startled in her course, flew as before the chariot"
4057,ARGUMENT,of the goddess of love.
4058,ARGUMENT,
4059,ARGUMENT,"Zosia with a shout rushed through the window into the chamber, and, out of"
4060,ARGUMENT,"breath, sat down upon her aunt's lap; Telimena, kissing her and stroking"
4061,ARGUMENT,"her under the chin, with joy observed the liveliness and charm of the"
4062,ARGUMENT,child (for she really loved her ward). But once more she made a solemn
4063,ARGUMENT,"face, rose, and walking up and down and across the chamber, and holding"
4064,ARGUMENT,"her finger on her lips, she spoke thus:--"
4065,ARGUMENT,
4066,ARGUMENT,"""My dear Zosia, you are quite forgetful both of your age and of your"
4067,ARGUMENT,"station in life. Why, to-day you are beginning your fourteenth year; it is"
4068,ARGUMENT,time to give up turkeys and hens. Fie! is such fun worthy of a dignitary's
4069,ARGUMENT,daughter? And you have petted long enough those sunburned peasants'
4070,ARGUMENT,"children, Zosia! My heart aches to look at you; you have tanned your"
4071,ARGUMENT,"shoulders dreadfully, like a real little gypsy; and you walk and move like"
4072,ARGUMENT,a village girl. From now on I shall see that all this is changed. I shall
4073,ARGUMENT,"begin to-day; to-day I shall take you into society, to the drawing-room,"
4074,ARGUMENT,to our guests; we have a throng of guests here. See that you do not cause
4075,ARGUMENT,"me shame."""
4076,ARGUMENT,
4077,ARGUMENT,"Zosia jumped from her place and clapped her hands; and, clasping both arms"
4078,ARGUMENT,"around her aunt's neck, she wept and laughed by turns for very joy."
4079,ARGUMENT,
4080,ARGUMENT,"""O auntie, it is so long since I have seen any guests! Since I have been"
4081,ARGUMENT,"living here with the hens and turkeys, the only guest that I have seen was"
4082,ARGUMENT,a wild dove. I'm just a little tired of sitting in the chamber; the Judge
4083,ARGUMENT,"even says that it is bad for the health."""
4084,ARGUMENT,
4085,ARGUMENT,"""The Judge,"" interrupted her aunt, ""has continually been bothering me with"
4086,ARGUMENT,requests to take you out into society; has continually been mumbling under
4087,ARGUMENT,his breath that you are already grown up. He doesn't know what he is
4088,ARGUMENT,talking about himself; he is an old fellow who never had any experience in
4089,ARGUMENT,"the great world. I know better how much preparation a young lady needs, in"
4090,ARGUMENT,"order to make an impression when she comes out in society. You see, Zosia,"
4091,ARGUMENT,"that any one who grows up in the sight of men, even though she may be"
4092,ARGUMENT,"beautiful and clever, produces no impression, since all have been"
4093,ARGUMENT,"accustomed to seeing her ever since she was small. But if a well-trained,"
4094,ARGUMENT,grown-up young lady suddenly appears glittering before the world from no
4095,ARGUMENT,"one knows where, then everybody crowds up to her out of curiosity,"
4096,ARGUMENT,"observes all her movements, each glance of her eye, attends to her words"
4097,ARGUMENT,"and repeats them to others; and when a young person gets to be in fashion,"
4098,ARGUMENT,"every one must praise her, even if he does not like her. I hope that you"
4099,ARGUMENT,know how to behave; you grew up in the capital. Though you have been
4100,ARGUMENT,"living two years hereabouts, you have not yet completely forgotten St."
4101,ARGUMENT,"Petersburg. Well, Zosia, make your toilet; get the things from my desk,"
4102,ARGUMENT,"you will find ready everything needed for dressing. Hurry up, for at any"
4103,ARGUMENT,"minute they may come home from hunting."""
4104,ARGUMENT,
4105,ARGUMENT,The chambermaid and a serving girl were summoned; into a silver basin they
4106,ARGUMENT,"poured a pitcher of water, and Zosia, fluttering like a sparrow in the"
4107,ARGUMENT,"sand, washed with the aid of the servant her hands, face, and neck."
4108,ARGUMENT,Telimena opened her St. Petersburg stores and took forth bottles of
4109,ARGUMENT,"perfumes, and jars of pomade; she sprinkled Zosia over with choice"
4110,ARGUMENT,perfume--the fragrance filled the room--and smeared her hair with ointment.
4111,ARGUMENT,Zosia put on white open-work stockings and white satin shoes from Warsaw.
4112,ARGUMENT,"Meanwhile the chambermaid had laced her up, and then thrown a"
4113,ARGUMENT,dressing-sack over the young lady's shoulders: after crimping her hair
4114,ARGUMENT,"with a hot iron they proceeded to take off the curl-papers; her locks,"
4115,ARGUMENT,"since they were rather short, they made into two braids, leaving the hair"
4116,ARGUMENT,"smooth on the brow and temples. Then the chambermaid, weaving into a"
4117,ARGUMENT,"wreath some freshly gathered cornflowers, gave them to Telimena, who"
4118,ARGUMENT,"pinned them skilfully on Zosia's head, from the right to the left: the"
4119,ARGUMENT,"flowers were relieved very beautifully against the light hair, as against"
4120,ARGUMENT,ears of grain! They took off the dressing-sack; the toilet was complete.
4121,ARGUMENT,"Zosia threw over her head a white gown, and rolled up a little white"
4122,ARGUMENT,"handkerchief in her hand, and thus, all in white, she looked like a white"
4123,ARGUMENT,lily herself.
4124,ARGUMENT,
4125,ARGUMENT,"After adjusting once more both her hair and her apparel, they told her to"
4126,ARGUMENT,walk the length and breadth of the room. Telimena observed her with the
4127,ARGUMENT,"eyes of an expert; she drilled her niece, grew angry, and grimaced;"
4128,ARGUMENT,finally at Zosia's curtsy she cried out in despair:--
4129,ARGUMENT,
4130,ARGUMENT,"""Unhappy me! Zosia, you see what comes of living among geese and"
4131,ARGUMENT,"shepherds! You stride along like a boy, and turn your eyes to the right"
4132,ARGUMENT,"and left like a divorced woman! Curtsy! see how awkward you are!"""
4133,ARGUMENT,
4134,ARGUMENT,"""O, auntie,"" said Zosia sadly, ""how am I to blame? You have locked me up,"
4135,ARGUMENT,auntie; there was nobody to dance with; to pass the time away I liked to
4136,ARGUMENT,"feed the birds and to pet the children. But just wait, auntie, till I've"
4137,ARGUMENT,"lived among other people for a little while; you'll see how I improve."""
4138,ARGUMENT,
4139,ARGUMENT,"""Well, of the two evils,"" said her aunt, ""it was better to stay with the"
4140,ARGUMENT,birds than with such a rabble as have hitherto been our guests; just
4141,ARGUMENT,"recollect who have been our visitors here: the parish priest, who mumbled"
4142,ARGUMENT,"a prayer or played checkers, and the lawyers with their tobacco pipes!"
4143,ARGUMENT,They are noble cavaliers! You would have learned fine manners from them!
4144,ARGUMENT,Now at all events there is some one to show yourself to; we have a
4145,ARGUMENT,"well-bred company in the house. Note well, Zosia, we have here a young"
4146,ARGUMENT,"Count, a gentleman, well educated, a relative of the Wojewoda; see that"
4147,ARGUMENT,"you are polite to him."""
4148,ARGUMENT,
4149,ARGUMENT,The neighing of horses is heard and the chatter of the hunters; they are
4150,ARGUMENT,at the gate: here they are! Taking Zosia on her arm she ran to the
4151,ARGUMENT,reception room. None of the sportsmen had as yet come in; they had to
4152,ARGUMENT,"change their clothes in the chambers, as they did not wish to join the"
4153,ARGUMENT,"ladies in their hunting coats. The first to enter were the young men,"
4154,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus and the Count, who had dressed in great haste."
4155,ARGUMENT,
4156,ARGUMENT,"Telimena discharged the duties of hostess, greeted those who entered,"
4157,ARGUMENT,"offered them seats, and entertained them with conversation; she presented"
4158,ARGUMENT,"her niece to each in turn, first of all to Thaddeus, as being his near"
4159,ARGUMENT,"relative. Zosia curtsied politely; he bowed low, wanted to say something"
4160,ARGUMENT,"to her, and had already opened his lips; but, when he looked into Zosia's"
4161,ARGUMENT,"eyes he was so abashed, that, standing dumb before her, he first flushed"
4162,ARGUMENT,"and then grew pale. What lay upon his heart, he himself could not guess;"
4163,ARGUMENT,he felt himself very unhappy--he had recognised Zosia--by her stature and
4164,ARGUMENT,her bright hair and her voice! That form and that little head he had seen
4165,ARGUMENT,as she stood upon the fence; that charming voice had aroused him to-day
4166,ARGUMENT,for the hunt.
4167,ARGUMENT,
4168,ARGUMENT,The Seneschal extricated Thaddeus from his confusion. Seeing that he was
4169,ARGUMENT,"growing pale and that he was tottering on his legs, he advised him to go"
4170,ARGUMENT,to his room and rest. Thaddeus took his stand in the corner and leaned on
4171,ARGUMENT,"the mantel, without saying a word--his wide-open, wandering eyes he turned"
4172,ARGUMENT,now on the aunt and now on the niece. Telimena perceived that his first
4173,ARGUMENT,"sight of Zosia had made a great impression on him; she did not guess all,"
4174,ARGUMENT,"but she seemed rather distracted as she entertained the guests, and did"
4175,ARGUMENT,"not take her eyes from the young man. Finally, watching her chance, she"
4176,ARGUMENT,"ran up to him. ""Are you well? Why are you so gloomy?"" she asked him; she"
4177,ARGUMENT,"pressed her questions, she hinted about Zosia, and began to jest with him."
4178,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus was unmoved; leaning on his elbow, he kept silent, frowned, and"
4179,ARGUMENT,puckered his lips: so much the more did he confuse and amaze Telimena.
4180,ARGUMENT,Suddenly she changed her countenance and the tone of her discourse; she
4181,ARGUMENT,"arose in wrath, and with sharp words began to shower on him sarcasms and"
4182,ARGUMENT,"reproaches. Thaddeus, too, started up, as if stung by a wasp; he looked"
4183,ARGUMENT,"askance; without saying a word he spat, kicked away his chair, and bolted"
4184,ARGUMENT,"from the room, slamming the door behind him. Luckily no one of the guests"
4185,ARGUMENT,paid attention to this scene except Telimena.
4186,ARGUMENT,
4187,ARGUMENT,"Flying out through the gate, he ran straight into the field. As a pike,"
4188,ARGUMENT,"when a fisherman's spear pierces through its breast, plunges and dives,"
4189,ARGUMENT,"thinking to escape, but everywhere drags with it the iron and the line; so"
4190,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus bore with him his troubles, as he ploughed through the ditches"
4191,ARGUMENT,"and vaulted the fences, without aim or path; until, after wandering for no"
4192,ARGUMENT,"small time, he finally entered the depths of the wood, and, whether on"
4193,ARGUMENT,"purpose or by chance, happened on the little hill which was the witness of"
4194,ARGUMENT,"his yesterday's happiness, and where he had received that note, the"
4195,ARGUMENT,"earnest of love: a place, as we know, called the Temple of Meditation."
4196,ARGUMENT,
4197,ARGUMENT,"When he glanced about, behold! there she was! It was Telimena, solitary,"
4198,ARGUMENT,"buried in thought, and changed in pose and costume from her of yesterday:"
4199,ARGUMENT,"dressed all in white, seated upon a stone, and motionless, as if herself"
4200,ARGUMENT,"carved of stone, she had buried her face in her open hands; though you"
4201,ARGUMENT,could not hear her sobs you felt that she was dissolved in tears.
4202,ARGUMENT,
4203,ARGUMENT,"In vain did the heart of Thaddeus defend itself; he took pity, he felt"
4204,ARGUMENT,"that compassion moved him. He long gazed without speaking, hidden behind a"
4205,ARGUMENT,"tree; at last he sighed, and said to himself angrily: ""Stupid, how is she"
4206,ARGUMENT,"to blame if I deceived myself?"" So he slowly thrust out his head towards"
4207,ARGUMENT,her from behind the tree. But suddenly Telimena tore herself from her
4208,ARGUMENT,"seat, threw herself to the right and the left, and jumped across the"
4209,ARGUMENT,"stream; with outstretched arms and dishevelled hair, all pale, she rushed"
4210,ARGUMENT,"for the wood, leapt into the air, knelt, and fell down; and, not being"
4211,ARGUMENT,"able to get up again, she writhed on the turf. One could see by her"
4212,ARGUMENT,motions from what dreadful torture she was suffering; she seized herself
4213,ARGUMENT,"by the breast, the neck, the soles of her feet, her knees. Thaddeus sprang"
4214,ARGUMENT,"towards her, thinking that she had gone mad or was having an epileptic"
4215,ARGUMENT,fit. But these movements proceeded from a different cause.
4216,ARGUMENT,
4217,ARGUMENT,By a neighbouring birch tree was a great ant-hill; the frugal insects were
4218,ARGUMENT,"wont to crawl around over the grass, mobile and black. Whether from"
4219,ARGUMENT,"necessity or from pleasure one cannot tell, they were especially fond of"
4220,ARGUMENT,"visiting the Temple of Meditation; from the hillock, their capital, to the"
4221,ARGUMENT,"shores of the spring they had trodden a path, by which they led their"
4222,ARGUMENT,troops. Unfortunately Telimena was sitting in the middle of the pathway;
4223,ARGUMENT,"the ants, allured by the sheen of the snow-white stocking, crawled up on"
4224,ARGUMENT,"it, and in swarms began to tickle and bite. Telimena was forced to run"
4225,ARGUMENT,"away and shake herself, finally to sit down on the grass and catch the"
4226,ARGUMENT,insects.
4227,ARGUMENT,
4228,ARGUMENT,Thaddeus could not refuse her his aid; brushing her gown he bent down to
4229,ARGUMENT,her feet; by chance he approached his lips to Telimena's temples--in so
4230,ARGUMENT,"tender a posture, though they said nothing of their recent quarrels,"
4231,ARGUMENT,nevertheless they were reconciled; and there is no telling how long their
4232,ARGUMENT,"discourse would have lasted, had not the bell from Soplicowo aroused them."
4233,ARGUMENT,
4234,ARGUMENT,"It was the signal for supper; it was time to return home, especially since"
4235,ARGUMENT,in the distance the crackling of broken branches could be heard. Perhaps
4236,ARGUMENT,they were looking for them? To return together was not fitting; so
4237,ARGUMENT,"Telimena stole to the right towards the garden, and Thaddeus ran to the"
4238,ARGUMENT,"left, to the highway. On this detour both were somewhat disturbed: it"
4239,ARGUMENT,"seemed to Telimena that once from behind a bush shone the thin, cowled"
4240,ARGUMENT,face of Robak; Thaddeus saw distinctly that once or twice a long white
4241,ARGUMENT,"phantom made its appearance on his left; what it was he knew not, but he"
4242,ARGUMENT,had a suspicion that it was the Count in his long English frock coat.
4243,ARGUMENT,
4244,ARGUMENT,"They had supper in the old castle. The obstinate Protazy, not heeding the"
4245,ARGUMENT,"definite orders of the Judge, had again stormed the castle in the absence"
4246,ARGUMENT,"of the people of higher station, and, as he said, had foreclosed the"
4247,ARGUMENT,mortgage on it. The guests entered in order and stood about the table. The
4248,ARGUMENT,Chamberlain took his place at the head; this honour befitted him from his
4249,ARGUMENT,"age and his office; advancing to it he bowed to the ladies, the old men,"
4250,ARGUMENT,and the young men. The Collector of Alms was not at the table; the
4251,ARGUMENT,"Chamberlain's wife occupied the place of the Bernardine, on her husband's"
4252,ARGUMENT,"right. The Judge, when he had stationed the guests as was fitting,"
4253,ARGUMENT,pronounced a Latin grace. Brandy was passed to the gentlemen; thereupon
4254,ARGUMENT,"all sat down, and silently and with relish they ate the cold salad of beet"
4255,ARGUMENT,leaves whitened with cream.
4256,ARGUMENT,
4257,ARGUMENT,"After the cold dish came crabs, chickens, and asparagus, along with"
4258,ARGUMENT,"glasses of Malaga and of Hungarian wine; all ate, drank, and were silent."
4259,ARGUMENT,"Probably never since the time when the walls of this castle were erected,"
4260,ARGUMENT,"which had generously entertained so many noble gentlemen, and had heard"
4261,ARGUMENT,"and echoed so many vivats, had there been memory of so gloomy a supper."
4262,ARGUMENT,"The great, empty hall of the castle echoed only the popping of corks and"
4263,ARGUMENT,the clink of plates; you would have said that some evil spirit had tied up
4264,ARGUMENT,the lips of the guests.
4265,ARGUMENT,
4266,ARGUMENT,Many were the causes of this silence. The sportsmen had returned from the
4267,ARGUMENT,"forest talkative enough, but when their ardour had cooled, and they"
4268,ARGUMENT,"thought over the hunt, they realised that they had come out of it with no"
4269,ARGUMENT,"great glory: was it necessary that a monkish cowl, bobbing up from God"
4270,ARGUMENT,"knows where, like Philip from the hemp,91 should give a lesson to all the"
4271,ARGUMENT,huntsmen of the district? O shame! What would they say of this in Oszmiana
4272,ARGUMENT,"and Lida, which for ages had been rivals of their own district for the"
4273,ARGUMENT,supremacy in woodcrafts? So they were thinking this over.
4274,ARGUMENT,
4275,ARGUMENT,"But the Assessor and the Notary, besides their mutual grudges, had on"
4276,ARGUMENT,their minds the recent shame of their greyhounds. Before their eyes
4277,ARGUMENT,"hovered a rascally hare, leaping nimbly about and bobbing its little tail"
4278,ARGUMENT,"from the wood's edge, in mockery of them; with this tail it beat upon"
4279,ARGUMENT,their hearts as with a scourge: so they sat with faces bent over their
4280,ARGUMENT,"plates. But the Assessor had still more recent reasons for chagrin, when"
4281,ARGUMENT,he gazed at Telimena and at his rivals.
4282,ARGUMENT,
4283,ARGUMENT,"Telimena was sitting half turned away from Thaddeus, and in her confusion"
4284,ARGUMENT,"hardly dared to glance at him; she wanted to amuse the gloomy Count, and"
4285,ARGUMENT,"to make him talk more freely, so as to get him into better humour; for the"
4286,ARGUMENT,"Count was strangely glum when he returned from his walk, or rather, as"
4287,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus thought, from his ambuscade. While listening to Telimena he"
4288,ARGUMENT,"raised his brow haughtily, frowned, and looked at her almost with"
4289,ARGUMENT,"contempt; then he sat down as near Zosia as he could, filled her glass,"
4290,ARGUMENT,"and passed plates to her, saying a thousand polite things, and bowing and"
4291,ARGUMENT,"smiling; sometimes he rolled his eyes and sighed deeply. It was evident,"
4292,ARGUMENT,"however, despite such skilful deception, that he was flirting merely to"
4293,ARGUMENT,"spite Telimena; for every time that he turned his head away, apparently by"
4294,ARGUMENT,"accident, his threatening eye glittered upon Telimena."
4295,ARGUMENT,
4296,ARGUMENT,Telimena could not understand what all this meant; shrugging her
4297,ARGUMENT,"shoulders, she thought, ""He's showing off!"" After all she was rather glad"
4298,ARGUMENT,"of the Count's new courtship, and turned her attention to her other"
4299,ARGUMENT,neighbour.
4300,ARGUMENT,
4301,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus, also gloomy, ate nothing and drank nothing; he seemed to be"
4302,ARGUMENT,"listening to the conversation, and glued his eyes on his plate. When"
4303,ARGUMENT,"Telimena poured him out wine, he was angry at her importunity; when she"
4304,ARGUMENT,"asked about his health, he yawned. He took it ill (so much had he changed"
4305,ARGUMENT,in one evening) that Telimena was too ready to flirt; he was vext that her
4306,ARGUMENT,"gown was cut so low--immodestly--and now for the first time, when he raised"
4307,ARGUMENT,"his eyes, he was almost frightened! For his sight had quickened; hardly"
4308,ARGUMENT,"had he glanced at Telimena's rosy face, when all at once he discovered a"
4309,ARGUMENT,"great and terrible secret! For Heaven's sake, she was rouged!"
4310,ARGUMENT,
4311,ARGUMENT,"Whether the rouge was of a bad sort, or somehow had been accidentally"
4312,ARGUMENT,"scratched upon her face, at all events, here and there it was thin, and"
4313,ARGUMENT,"revealed beneath it a coarser complexion. Perhaps Thaddeus himself, in the"
4314,ARGUMENT,"Temple of Meditation, speaking too near her, had brushed from its white"
4315,ARGUMENT,"foundation the carmine, lighter than the dust of a butterfly's wing."
4316,ARGUMENT,"Telimena had come back from the wood in too much of a hurry, and had not"
4317,ARGUMENT,"had time to repair her colouring; around her mouth, in particular,"
4318,ARGUMENT,"freckles could be seen. So the eyes of Thaddeus, like cunning spies,"
4319,ARGUMENT,"having discovered one piece of treason, began to explore one after another"
4320,ARGUMENT,"her remaining charms, and everywhere discovered some falsity. Two teeth"
4321,ARGUMENT,were missing in her mouth; on her brow and temples there were wrinkles;
4322,ARGUMENT,thousands of wrinkles were concealed beneath her chin.
4323,ARGUMENT,
4324,ARGUMENT,Alas! Thaddeus felt how unwise it is to observe too closely a beautiful
4325,ARGUMENT,object; how shameful to be a spy over one's sweetheart; how even loathsome
4326,ARGUMENT,it is to change one's taste and heart--but who can control his heart? In
4327,ARGUMENT,"vain he tried to supply the lack of love by conscience, to warm again the"
4328,ARGUMENT,"coldness of his soul with the flame of her glance; now that glance, like"
4329,ARGUMENT,"the moon, bright but without warmth, shone over the surface of a soul that"
4330,ARGUMENT,was chilled to its depths. Making such complaints and reproaches to
4331,ARGUMENT,"himself, he bent his head over his plate, kept silent, and bit his lips."
4332,ARGUMENT,
4333,ARGUMENT,"Meanwhile an evil spirit assailed him with a new temptation, to listen to"
4334,ARGUMENT,"what Zosia was saying to the Count. The girl, captivated by the Count's"
4335,ARGUMENT,"affability, at first blushed, lowering her eyes; then they began to laugh,"
4336,ARGUMENT,"and finally to talk about a certain unexpected meeting in the garden,"
4337,ARGUMENT,about a certain stepping over the burdocks and the vegetable beds.
4338,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus, eagerly pricking up his ears, devoured the bitter words and"
4339,ARGUMENT,digested them in his soul. He had a frightful meal. As a serpent in a
4340,ARGUMENT,"garden drinks with its double tongue from poisonous herbs, then rolls into"
4341,ARGUMENT,"a ball and lies down upon the path, threatening the foot that may"
4342,ARGUMENT,"carelessly step upon it, so Thaddeus, filled with the poison of jealousy,"
4343,ARGUMENT,"seemed indifferent, but yet was bursting with malice."
4344,ARGUMENT,
4345,ARGUMENT,"In the merriest assembly, if a few are out of sorts, at once their gloom"
4346,ARGUMENT,"spreads to the rest. The sportsmen had long ceased to speak, and now the"
4347,ARGUMENT,"other side of the table became silent, infected with the spleen of"
4348,ARGUMENT,Thaddeus.
4349,ARGUMENT,
4350,ARGUMENT,"Even the Chamberlain was unusually gloomy and had no wish to chat,"
4351,ARGUMENT,"observing that his daughters, handsome and well-dowered young ladies as"
4352,ARGUMENT,"they were, in the flower of youth, by universal opinion the best matches"
4353,ARGUMENT,"in the district, were silent and neglected by the young men, who were also"
4354,ARGUMENT,silent. This also caused concern to the hospitable Judge; and the
4355,ARGUMENT,"Seneschal, noticing that all were thus silent, called the meal not a"
4356,ARGUMENT,Polish but a wolves' supper.
4357,ARGUMENT,
4358,ARGUMENT,Hreczecha had an ear very sensitive to silence; he himself was a great
4359,ARGUMENT,"talker, and he was inordinately fond of chatterers. It was no wonder! He"
4360,ARGUMENT,"had passed all his life with the gentry at banquets, hunts, assemblies,"
4361,ARGUMENT,and district consultations; he was accustomed to having something always
4362,ARGUMENT,"drumming in his ears, even when he himself was silent, or was stealing"
4363,ARGUMENT,"with a flapper after a fly, or sat musing with closed eyes; by day he"
4364,ARGUMENT,"sought conversation, by night they had to repeat to him the rosary"
4365,ARGUMENT,"prayers, or tell him stories. Hence also he was a staunch enemy of the"
4366,ARGUMENT,"tobacco pipe, which he thought invented by the Germans in order to"
4367,ARGUMENT,"denationalise us. He used to say, ""To make Poland dumb is to Germanise"
4368,ARGUMENT,"Poland.""92 The old man, who had prattled all through his life, now wished"
4369,ARGUMENT,"to repose amid prattle; silence awoke him from sleep: thus millers, lulled"
4370,ARGUMENT,"by the clatter of the wheels, as soon as the axles stop, awake crying in"
4371,ARGUMENT,"fright: ""The Lord be with us!""93"
4372,ARGUMENT,
4373,ARGUMENT,"The Seneschal by a bow made a sign to the Chamberlain, and, with his hand"
4374,ARGUMENT,"raised to his lips, motioned to the Judge, asking for the floor. The"
4375,ARGUMENT,"gentlemen both returned that mute bow, meaning, ""Pray speak."" The"
4376,ARGUMENT,Seneschal opened his address:--
4377,ARGUMENT,
4378,ARGUMENT,"""I might venture to beg the young men to entertain us at this supper,"
4379,ARGUMENT,"according to the ancient custom, not to sit silent and munch: are we"
4380,ARGUMENT,Capuchin fathers? Whoever keeps silent among the gentry acts exactly like
4381,ARGUMENT,a hunter who lets his cartridge rust in his gun; therefore I praise highly
4382,ARGUMENT,the garrulity of our ancestors. After the chase they went to the table not
4383,ARGUMENT,"only to eat, but that they might together speak forth freely what each one"
4384,ARGUMENT,had within his heart; the faults and merits of the huntsmen and the
4385,ARGUMENT,"beaters, the hounds, the shots--all were included in the order of the day;"
4386,ARGUMENT,there would arise a hubbub as dear to the ears of the sportsmen as a
4387,ARGUMENT,"second rousing of the beast. I know, I know what ails you all; that cloud"
4388,ARGUMENT,of black cares has undoubtedly arisen from Robak's cowl! You are ashamed
4389,ARGUMENT,of your bad shots! Let not your shame burn you; I have known better
4390,ARGUMENT,"hunters than you, and they used to miss; to hit, to miss, to correct one's"
4391,ARGUMENT,"mistake, that is hunter's luck. I myself, though I have been carrying a"
4392,ARGUMENT,"gun ever since I was a child, have often missed; that famous sportsman"
4393,ARGUMENT,"Tuloszczyk used to miss, and even the late Pan Rejtan did not always hit"
4394,ARGUMENT,the mark. Of Rejtan I will speak later. As for letting the beast escape
4395,ARGUMENT,"from the line of beaters, as for the two young gentlemen's not holding"
4396,ARGUMENT,"their ground before the beast as they ought, though they had a pike in"
4397,ARGUMENT,"their hands, _that_ no one can either praise or blame: for to retreat with"
4398,ARGUMENT,"one's gun loaded was, according to our old ideas, to be a coward of"
4399,ARGUMENT,"cowards; likewise to shoot blindly, as many do, without letting the beast"
4400,ARGUMENT,"come close or sighting at it, is a shameful thing; but whoever aims well,"
4401,ARGUMENT,"whoever lets the beast come near him as is proper, even if he misses, may"
4402,ARGUMENT,"retire without shame; or he may fight with the pike, but at his own"
4403,ARGUMENT,pleasure and not from compulsion; since the pike is put in a sportsman's
4404,ARGUMENT,hands not for attack but for defence alone. Such was the ancient custom;
4405,ARGUMENT,"and so believe me, and do not take your retreat to heart, my beloved"
4406,ARGUMENT,Thaddeus and Your Honour the Count. But whenever you call to mind the
4407,ARGUMENT,"happenings of to-day, remember also the caution of the old Seneschal, that"
4408,ARGUMENT,"one hunter should never get in another's way, and that two should never"
4409,ARGUMENT,"shoot at the same time at the same game."""
4410,ARGUMENT,
4411,ARGUMENT,"The Seneschal was just pronouncing the word _game_, when the Assessor"
4412,ARGUMENT,"whispered under his breath, _dame_. ""Bravo,"" cried the young men; there"
4413,ARGUMENT,"arose a murmur and laughter; all repeated Hreczecha's caution, especially"
4414,ARGUMENT,"the last word: some cried _game_, and others, laughing aloud, _dame_; the"
4415,ARGUMENT,"Notary whispered _skirt_, the Assessor, _flirt_, fixing upon Telimena eyes"
4416,ARGUMENT,like stilettos.
4417,ARGUMENT,
4418,ARGUMENT,"The Seneschal had not thought at all of making any personal allusions, and"
4419,ARGUMENT,had not noticed what they were secretly whispering; glad that he had been
4420,ARGUMENT,"able to stir up laughter among the ladies and the young men, he turned to"
4421,ARGUMENT,"the hunters, wishing to cheer them up also; and he began anew, pouring"
4422,ARGUMENT,himself out a glass of wine:--
4423,ARGUMENT,
4424,ARGUMENT,"""In vain do my eyes seek the Bernardine; I should like to tell him a"
4425,ARGUMENT,"curious incident, similar to what occurred at our hunt to-day. The Warden"
4426,ARGUMENT,told us that he had known but one man who could shoot at long range with
4427,ARGUMENT,"as good aim as Robak, but I knew another; by an equally sure shot he saved"
4428,ARGUMENT,"the lives of two men of high rank. I saw it myself, when Rejtan, the"
4429,ARGUMENT,"deputy to the Diet, went hunting with the Prince de Nassau in the forests"
4430,ARGUMENT,of Naliboki. Those lords were not jealous of the fame of an untitled
4431,ARGUMENT,"gentleman, but were the first to propose his health at table, and gave him"
4432,ARGUMENT,"countless splendid presents, and the hide of the boar that had been slain."
4433,ARGUMENT,"Of that wild boar and of the shot I will tell you as an eyewitness, for"
4434,ARGUMENT,"the incident was similar to that of to-day, and it happened to the"
4435,ARGUMENT,"greatest sportsmen of my time, to the deputy Rejtan and the Prince de"
4436,ARGUMENT,"Nassau."""
4437,ARGUMENT,
4438,ARGUMENT,"But then the Judge spoke up, pouring out a beaker:--"
4439,ARGUMENT,
4440,ARGUMENT,"""I drink the health of Robak; Seneschal, clink your glass with mine. If we"
4441,ARGUMENT,"cannot enrich the Alms-Gatherer with a gift, we will at least try to pay"
4442,ARGUMENT,him for his powder; we promise solemnly that the bear killed this day in
4443,ARGUMENT,the wood shall suffice the cloister kitchen for two years. But the skin I
4444,ARGUMENT,will not give to the Monk; I will either take it by force or the Monk must
4445,ARGUMENT,"yield it to me through humility, or I will buy it, though it cost me the"
4446,ARGUMENT,pelts of ten sables. Of that skin we will dispose according to our will;
4447,ARGUMENT,"the first crown and glory the servant of God has already received, the"

4449,ARGUMENT,"second reward."""
4450,ARGUMENT,
4451,ARGUMENT,The Chamberlain rubbed his forehead and lowered his eyebrows. The
4452,ARGUMENT,"sportsmen began to murmur, and each made some remark; one how he had"
4453,ARGUMENT,"discovered the beast, another how he had wounded it; this one had called"
4454,ARGUMENT,"on the dogs, and that turned back the beast into the forest once more. The"
4455,ARGUMENT,"Assessor and the Notary disputed, one exalting the merits of his Sanguszko"
4456,ARGUMENT,"gun, the other those of his Sagalas musket from Balabanowka."
4457,ARGUMENT,
4458,ARGUMENT,"""Neighbour Judge,"" pronounced the Chamberlain at last, ""the servant of God"
4459,ARGUMENT,has rightfully won the first reward; but it is not easy to decide who is
4460,ARGUMENT,"the next to him, for all seem to me to have equal merits, all to be equal"
4461,ARGUMENT,"in skill, adroitness, and courage. Fortune, however, has this day"
4462,ARGUMENT,distinguished two by the danger in which they were; two were nearest to
4463,ARGUMENT,"the bear's claws, Thaddeus and the Count; to them the skin belongs."
4464,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus will yield, I am sure, as the younger, and as the kinsman of our"
4465,ARGUMENT,host; hence Your Honour the Count will receive the _spolia opima_.94 Let
4466,ARGUMENT,"this trophy adorn your hunting chamber, let it be a reminder of to-day's"
4467,ARGUMENT,"sport, a symbol of fortune in the chase, a spur to future glory."""
4468,ARGUMENT,
4469,ARGUMENT,"He concluded gaily, thinking that he had soothed the Count, and did not"
4470,ARGUMENT,know how grievously he had stabbed his heart. For at the mention of his
4471,ARGUMENT,hunting chamber the Count involuntarily raised his eyes; and those horns
4472,ARGUMENT,"of stags, those branching antlers like a forest of laurels, sown by the"
4473,ARGUMENT,"hands of the fathers to form crowns for the sons, those pillars adorned"
4474,ARGUMENT,"with rows of portraits, that coat of arms shining in the vaulting, the old"
4475,ARGUMENT,"Half-Goat, spoke to him from all sides with voices of the past. He awoke"
4476,ARGUMENT,"from his musings, and remembered where he was and whose guest; he, the"
4477,ARGUMENT,"heir of the Horeszkos, was a guest within his own threshold, was feasting"
4478,ARGUMENT,"with the Soplicas, his immemorial foes! And moreover the jealousy that he"
4479,ARGUMENT,felt for Thaddeus incensed the Count all the more powerfully against the
4480,ARGUMENT,Soplicas. So he said with a bitter laugh:--
4481,ARGUMENT,
4482,ARGUMENT,"""My little house is too small; in it there is no worthy place for so"
4483,ARGUMENT,magnificent a gift: let the bear rather abide amid these horned trophies
4484,ARGUMENT,"until the Judge deign to yield it to me together with the castle."""
4485,ARGUMENT,
4486,ARGUMENT,"The Chamberlain, guessing whither things were tending, tapped his golden"
4487,ARGUMENT,"snuffbox, and asked for the floor."
4488,ARGUMENT,
4489,ARGUMENT,"""You deserve praise, my neighbour Count,"" he said, ""for caring for your"
4490,ARGUMENT,"interests even at dinner time, not living thoughtlessly from day to day as"
4491,ARGUMENT,do fashionable young fellows of your years. I wish and hope to end the
4492,ARGUMENT,trial in my Chamberlain's court by a reconciliation; hitherto the only
4493,ARGUMENT,difficulty has been over the improvements. I have formed a project of
4494,ARGUMENT,"exchange, to make up for the improvements with land, in the following"
4495,ARGUMENT,"fashion."""
4496,ARGUMENT,
4497,ARGUMENT,"Here he began to develop in due order, as he always did, a plan for the"
4498,ARGUMENT,exchange that was to take place. He was already in the middle of the
4499,ARGUMENT,"subject, when an unexpected movement started at the end of the table; some"
4500,ARGUMENT,"were pointing at something that they had noticed, and others were looking"
4501,ARGUMENT,"in the same direction, until finally all heads, like ears of grain bent"
4502,ARGUMENT,"down by a wind behind them, were turned away from the Chamberlain, to the"
4503,ARGUMENT,corner.
4504,ARGUMENT,
4505,ARGUMENT,"From the corner, where hung the portrait of the late Pantler, the last of"
4506,ARGUMENT,"the Horeszko family, from a little door concealed between the pillars, had"
4507,ARGUMENT,quietly come forth a form like a phantom. It was Gerwazy; they recognised
4508,ARGUMENT,"him by his stature, by his face, and by the little silvery Half-Goats on"
4509,ARGUMENT,"his yellow coat. He walked straight as a post, silent and grim, without"
4510,ARGUMENT,"taking off his hat, without even inclining his head; in his hand he held a"
4511,ARGUMENT,"glittering key, like a dagger; he opened a case and began to turn"
4512,ARGUMENT,something in it.
4513,ARGUMENT,
4514,ARGUMENT,"In two corners of the hall, against pillars, stood two musical clocks in"
4515,ARGUMENT,"locked cases; the queer old fellows, long at odds with the sun, often"
4516,ARGUMENT,indicated noon at sunset. Gerwazy had not undertaken to repair the
4517,ARGUMENT,"machines, but he would not give up winding them; he turned the key in the"
4518,ARGUMENT,"clocks every evening, and the time for winding had just come. While the"
4519,ARGUMENT,Chamberlain was occupying the attention of the parties interested in the
4520,ARGUMENT,"case, he drew up the weight; the rusty wheels gnashed their broken teeth;"
4521,ARGUMENT,"the Chamberlain shuddered and interrupted his dissertation. ""Brother,"" he"
4522,ARGUMENT,"said, ""postpone a bit your faithful toil;"" and he went on with his plan of"
4523,ARGUMENT,"an exchange; but the Warden, to spite him, pulled still more strongly the"
4524,ARGUMENT,"other weight, and suddenly the bullfinch perched on the top of the clock"
4525,ARGUMENT,"began to flap its wings and pour forth one of its melodies. The bird,"
4526,ARGUMENT,"which had been artistically made, but was, unfortunately, out of order,"
4527,ARGUMENT,"began to moan and whistle, ever worse and worse. The guests burst out"
4528,ARGUMENT,"laughing; the Chamberlain had to break off again. ""My dear Warden,"" he"
4529,ARGUMENT,"cried, ""or rather screech owl,95 if you value your beak, quit that"
4530,ARGUMENT,"hooting."""
4531,ARGUMENT,
4532,ARGUMENT,But Gerwazy was not at all frightened by the threat; with dignity he put
4533,ARGUMENT,his right hand on the clock and rested the left on his hip; with both
4534,ARGUMENT,hands thus supported he cried:--
4535,ARGUMENT,
4536,ARGUMENT,"""My precious Chamberlain, a grandee is free to make jokes. The sparrow is"
4537,ARGUMENT,"smaller than the owl, but on its own shavings it is bolder than the owl in"
4538,ARGUMENT,a mansion not its own. A Warden is no owl; whoever comes by night into
4539,ARGUMENT,"another man's loft is an owl, and I will scare him hence."""
4540,ARGUMENT,
4541,ARGUMENT,"""Put him out!"" shouted the Chamberlain."
4542,ARGUMENT,
4543,ARGUMENT,"""Count, you see what is being done,"" called the Warden. ""Is Your Honour"
4544,ARGUMENT,not yet sufficiently tainted by eating and drinking with these Soplicas?
4545,ARGUMENT,"In addition, must I, the keeper of the castle, Gerwazy Rembajlo, Warden of"
4546,ARGUMENT,"the Horeszkos, be insulted in the house of my lords?--and will you endure"
4547,ARGUMENT,"it!"""
4548,ARGUMENT,
4549,ARGUMENT,Thereupon Protazy called out three times.--
4550,ARGUMENT,
4551,ARGUMENT,"""Silence, clear the room! I, Protazy Baltazar Brzechalski, known under two"
4552,ARGUMENT,"titles, once General of the Tribunal, commonly called Apparitor, hereby"
4553,ARGUMENT,make my apparitor's report and formal declaration--claiming as witnesses
4554,ARGUMENT,all free-born persons here present and summoning the Assessor to
4555,ARGUMENT,investigate the case in behalf of His Honour Judge Soplica--as to an
4556,ARGUMENT,"incursion, that is to say, an infringement of the frontier, a violent"
4557,ARGUMENT,"entry of the castle, over which hitherto the Judge has had legal"
4558,ARGUMENT,"authority, an evident proof of which is the fact that he is eating in the"
4559,ARGUMENT,"castle."""
4560,ARGUMENT,
4561,ARGUMENT,"""Wind-bag,"" yelled the Warden, ""I'll show you now!"""
4562,ARGUMENT,
4563,ARGUMENT,"And, taking from his belt his iron keys, he whirled them round his head"
4564,ARGUMENT,and hurled them with all his might; the bunch of iron flew like a stone
4565,ARGUMENT,"from a sling. It would surely have split Protazy's brow into quarters, but"
4566,ARGUMENT,luckily the Apparitor ducked and escaped death.
4567,ARGUMENT,
4568,ARGUMENT,All started from their places. For a moment there was a dead silence; then
4569,ARGUMENT,"the Judge cried, ""To the stocks with that bully! Ho, boys!""--and the"
4570,ARGUMENT,servants rushed nimbly along the narrow passage between the wall and the
4571,ARGUMENT,"bench. But the Count blocked their way with a chair, and, placing his foot"
4572,ARGUMENT,"firmly on that feeble entrenchment, called out:--"
4573,ARGUMENT,
4574,ARGUMENT,"""Beware, Judge! No one shall do injury to my servant in my own house;"
4575,ARGUMENT,"whoever has a complaint against the old man, let him present it to me."""
4576,ARGUMENT,
4577,ARGUMENT,The Chamberlain cast a sidelong glance into the eyes of the Count:--
4578,ARGUMENT,
4579,ARGUMENT,"""Without your valuable aid I shall manage to punish the insolent old"
4580,ARGUMENT,fellow; but Your Honour the Count is appropriating the castle ahead of
4581,ARGUMENT,"time, before the decree is pronounced. You are not lord here, you are not"
4582,ARGUMENT,entertaining us. Sit quiet as you have been sitting; if you honour not my
4583,ARGUMENT,"grey head, at least respect the first office in the district."""
4584,ARGUMENT,
4585,ARGUMENT,"""What do I care?""  muttered the Count in return. ""Enough of this prattle!"
4586,ARGUMENT,Bore other men with your respects and offices! I have been guilty of folly
4587,ARGUMENT,"enough already, when I joined with you gentlemen in drinking bouts that"
4588,ARGUMENT,end by becoming coarse brawls. Give me satisfaction for the injury to my
4589,ARGUMENT,"honour! We shall meet again when you are sober--follow me, Gerwazy!"""
4590,ARGUMENT,
4591,ARGUMENT,"The Chamberlain had never expected any such answer as this, and was just"
4592,ARGUMENT,"filling his glass, when he was smitten by the insolence of the Count as by"
4593,ARGUMENT,"thunder: resting the bottle motionless against the glass, he leaned his"
4594,ARGUMENT,"head to one side and pricked up his ears, opening wide his eyes and half"
4595,ARGUMENT,"unclosing his lips; he held his peace, but squeezed the glass in his hand"
4596,ARGUMENT,so powerfully that it broke with a snap and sent the liquor spurting into
4597,ARGUMENT,his eyes. One would have said that with the wine fire was poured into his
4598,ARGUMENT,"soul; so did his face flame, so did his eye blaze. He struggled to speak;"
4599,ARGUMENT,"the first word he ground indistinctly in his mouth, until it flew forth"
4600,ARGUMENT,between his teeth:--
4601,ARGUMENT,
4602,ARGUMENT,"""Fool! you cub of a Count! I'll teach you! Thomas, my sabre! I'll teach"
4603,ARGUMENT,"you _mores_, you fool; get to hell out of here! Respects and offices wound"
4604,ARGUMENT,your delicate ears! I'll pay you up right off over your pretty earrings.
4605,ARGUMENT,"Get out of the door, draw your sword! Thomas, my sabre!"""
4606,ARGUMENT,
4607,ARGUMENT,"Then friends rushed to the Chamberlain, and the Judge seized his hand."
4608,ARGUMENT,
4609,ARGUMENT,"""Hold, sir, this is our affair; I was challenged first. Protazy, my"
4610,ARGUMENT,"hanger! I will make him dance like a bear on a pole!"""
4611,ARGUMENT,
4612,ARGUMENT,But Thaddeus checked the Judge:--
4613,ARGUMENT,
4614,ARGUMENT,"""My dear uncle, and Your Honour the Chamberlain, is it fitting for you"
4615,ARGUMENT,"gentlemen to meddle with this fop? Are there not young men here? And you,"
4616,ARGUMENT,"my brave youth, who challenge old men to combat, we shall see whether you"
4617,ARGUMENT,"are so terrible a knight; we will settle accounts to-morrow, and chose our"
4618,ARGUMENT,"place and weapons. To-day depart, while you are still whole."""
4619,ARGUMENT,
4620,ARGUMENT,The advice was good; the Warden and the Count had fallen into no common
4621,ARGUMENT,"straits. At the upper end of the table only a mighty shouting was raging,"
4622,ARGUMENT,but at the lower end bottles were flying around the head of the Count. The
4623,ARGUMENT,"frightened women began to beseech and weep; Telimena, with a cry of"
4624,ARGUMENT,"""Alas!"" lifted her eyes, rose, and fell in a faint; and, inclining her"
4625,ARGUMENT,"neck over the Count's shoulder, laid upon his breast her swan's breast."
4626,ARGUMENT,"The Count, infuriated though he was, checked himself in his mad career,"
4627,ARGUMENT,and began to revive her and chafe her.
4628,ARGUMENT,
4629,ARGUMENT,"Meanwhile Gerwazy, exposed to the blows of stools and bottles, was already"
4630,ARGUMENT,"tottering; already the servants, doubling up their fists, were rushing on"
4631,ARGUMENT,"him from all sides in a crowd, when, fortunately, Zosia, seeing the"
4632,ARGUMENT,"assault, leapt up, and, filled with pity, sheltered the old man by"
4633,ARGUMENT,extending her arms like a cross. They checked themselves; Gerwazy slowly
4634,ARGUMENT,retired and vanished from sight; they looked to see where he had hidden
4635,ARGUMENT,"himself beneath the table, when suddenly he came out on the other side as"
4636,ARGUMENT,"if from under the earth, and, raising aloft a bench in his strong arms,"
4637,ARGUMENT,whirled round like a windmill and cleared half the hall. He seized the
4638,ARGUMENT,"Count, and thus both, sheltered by the bench, retired towards the little"
4639,ARGUMENT,"door; when they were already almost at the threshold, Gerwazy stopped,"
4640,ARGUMENT,"once more eyed his foes, and deliberated for an instant, whether to retire"
4641,ARGUMENT,"under arms, or with new weapons to seek fortune in war. He chose the"
4642,ARGUMENT,"second; already he had swung back the bench for a blow, like a"
4643,ARGUMENT,"battering-ram; already, with head bent down, breast thrust forward, and"
4644,ARGUMENT,"foot uplifted, he was about to attack--when he caught sight of the"
4645,ARGUMENT,"Seneschal, and felt terror in his heart."
4646,ARGUMENT,
4647,ARGUMENT,"The Seneschal, sitting quietly, with half-closed eyes, had seemed buried"
4648,ARGUMENT,in deep thought; only when the Count had bandied words with the
4649,ARGUMENT,"Chamberlain and threatened the Judge, the Seneschal had turned his head,"
4650,ARGUMENT,had twice taken a pinch of snuff and rubbed his eyes. Although the
4651,ARGUMENT,"Seneschal was only a distant relative of the Judge, yet he was established"
4652,ARGUMENT,"in his hospitable house, and was beyond measure careful about the health"
4653,ARGUMENT,"of his friend. Therefore he gazed with curiosity at the combat, and slowly"
4654,ARGUMENT,"extended on the table his arm, hand, and fingers; on his palm he laid a"
4655,ARGUMENT,"knife, with the haft extended to the tip of the index finger, and the"
4656,ARGUMENT,point turned towards his elbow; then with his arm extended a trifle
4657,ARGUMENT,backward he poised it as if playing with it--but he watched the Count.
4658,ARGUMENT,
4659,ARGUMENT,"The art of throwing knives, terrible in hand to hand combat, had at that"
4660,ARGUMENT,"time already fallen into disuse in Lithuania, and was familiar only to old"
4661,ARGUMENT,"men; the Warden had tried it often in tavern quarrels, and the Seneschal"
4662,ARGUMENT,was expert at it. From the motion of his arm one could see that he would
4663,ARGUMENT,"hit hard, and from his eyes one could easily guess that he was aiming at"
4664,ARGUMENT,"the Count (the last of the Horeszkos, although in the female line); the"
4665,ARGUMENT,"young men, less observant, did not understand the motions of the old"
4666,ARGUMENT,"Seneschal, but Gerwazy turned pale, shielded the Count with the bench, and"
4667,ARGUMENT,"withdrew towards the door.--""Catch him!"" shouted the crowd."
4668,ARGUMENT,
4669,ARGUMENT,As a wolf when surprised over its carrion throws itself blindly into the
4670,ARGUMENT,"pack that disturbs its meal; he is already chasing them, he is about to"
4671,ARGUMENT,"tear them, when amid the yelping of the dogs a gun hammer gently clicks;"
4672,ARGUMENT,"the wolf recognises it by the click, glances in that direction; he notices"
4673,ARGUMENT,"that in the rear, behind the hounds, a hunter, half crouching and upon one"
4674,ARGUMENT,"knee, is moving the gun barrel towards him and is just touching the"
4675,ARGUMENT,trigger; the wolf droops its ears and scuttles off with its tail between
4676,ARGUMENT,its legs; the pack with a triumphant uproar rush on and pluck it by its
4677,ARGUMENT,"shaggy flanks; the beast often turns, glances at them, snaps its jaws; and"
4678,ARGUMENT,hardly does he threaten them with the gnashing of his white teeth when the
4679,ARGUMENT,"pack scamper away whining: so did Gerwazy withdraw with threatening mien,"
4680,ARGUMENT,"checking his assailants by his eyes and by the bench, until the Count and"
4681,ARGUMENT,he reached the back of the dark niche.
4682,ARGUMENT,
4683,ARGUMENT,"""Catch him!"" they cried again; the triumph was not long: for over the"
4684,ARGUMENT,"heads of the throng the Warden appeared unexpectedly in the gallery, by"
4685,ARGUMENT,"the old organ, and with a crash began to tear out the leaden pipes; he"
4686,ARGUMENT,would have worked great havoc by his blows from above. But the guests were
4687,ARGUMENT,already leaving the hall in a throng; the terrified servants did not dare
4688,ARGUMENT,"to hold their ground, but, seizing some of the platters, ran out after"
4689,ARGUMENT,their masters; they left behind even the plates and a part of the service.
4690,ARGUMENT,
4691,ARGUMENT,"Who last, caring not for the threats and blows, retired from the scene of"
4692,ARGUMENT,"battle? Protazy Brzechalski. He, standing unmoved behind the Judge's"
4693,ARGUMENT,"chair, in his apparitor's voice recited his notification until he had"
4694,ARGUMENT,"reached the very end; then he abandoned the empty battlefield, where"
4695,ARGUMENT,"remained corpses, wounded, and ruins."
4696,ARGUMENT,
4697,ARGUMENT,Among the men there were no casualties; but all the benches had legs
4698,ARGUMENT,"dislocated, and the table was also crippled: stripped of its cloth, it lay"
4699,ARGUMENT,upon plates dripping with wine--like a knight upon bloody shields--among
4700,ARGUMENT,"numerous bodies of chickens and turkeys, from which protruded the forks"
4701,ARGUMENT,lately stuck within their breasts.
4702,ARGUMENT,
4703,ARGUMENT,In a moment all within the deserted building of the Horeszkos had returned
4704,ARGUMENT,to its wonted calm. The darkness thickened; the remnants of the
4705,ARGUMENT,magnificent feast lay like that nocturnal banquet to which the ghosts of
4706,ARGUMENT,the departed must gather when evoked at the festival of the
4707,ARGUMENT,"_Forefathers_.96 Now the owls had cried thrice from the garret, like"
4708,ARGUMENT,conjurers; they seemed to greet the rising of the moon of which the form
4709,ARGUMENT,"fell through the window on the table, trembling like a spirit in"
4710,ARGUMENT,"Purgatory; from the vaults beneath rats leapt out through holes, like the"
4711,ARGUMENT,souls of the damned; they gnawed and drank; at times in a corner a
4712,ARGUMENT,forgotten champagne bottle would pop as a toast to the spirits.
4713,ARGUMENT,
4714,ARGUMENT,"But on the second story, in the room that was still called the mirror"
4715,ARGUMENT,"room, though the mirrors were gone, stood the Count on the balcony facing"
4716,ARGUMENT,the gate. He was cooling himself in the breeze; he had put his long coat
4717,ARGUMENT,"on only one arm, folding the other sleeve and the skirts about his neck"
4718,ARGUMENT,and draping his breast with the coat as with a cloak. Gerwazy was walking
4719,ARGUMENT,"with long steps through the apartment; both were deep in thought, and were"
4720,ARGUMENT,talking together.
4721,ARGUMENT,
4722,ARGUMENT,"""Pistols,"" said the Count, ""or, if they prefer, sabres."""
4723,ARGUMENT,
4724,ARGUMENT,"""The castle,"" said the Warden, ""and the village, both are ours."""
4725,ARGUMENT,
4726,ARGUMENT,"""Challenge the uncle, the nephew,"" exclaimed the Count, ""the whole"
4727,ARGUMENT,"family!"""
4728,ARGUMENT,
4729,ARGUMENT,"""Seize the castle,"" exclaimed the Warden, ""the village and the lands!""--As"
4730,ARGUMENT,"he said this he turned to the Count.--""If you wish to have peace, take"
4731,ARGUMENT,"possession of the whole. Of what use is the lawsuit, my boy! The affair is"
4732,ARGUMENT,plain as day: the castle has been in the hands of the Horeszkos for four
4733,ARGUMENT,hundred years; a part of the estate was torn from it in the time of the
4734,ARGUMENT,"Targowica confederacy, and, as you know, given into the possession of the"
4735,ARGUMENT,"Soplica. You ought to take from them not only that part, but the whole,"
4736,ARGUMENT,"for the costs of the suit, and as punishment for their plundering. I have"
4737,ARGUMENT,"always said to you, let lawsuits alone; I have always said to you, raid"
4738,ARGUMENT,"them, make a foray97 on them. That was the ancient custom: whoever once"
4739,ARGUMENT,possessed an estate was the heir thereof; win in the field and you will
4740,ARGUMENT,"win in the court too. As for our ancient quarrels with the Soplicas, for"
4741,ARGUMENT,"them I have a little penknife that is better than a lawsuit; and, if"
4742,ARGUMENT,"Maciej gives me the aid of his switch, then we two together will chop"
4743,ARGUMENT,"those Soplicas into fodder."""
4744,ARGUMENT,
4745,ARGUMENT,"""Bravo!"" said the Count, ""your plan, of Gothico-Sarmatian stamp, pleases"
4746,ARGUMENT,me better than the wrangling of advocates. See here! Through all Lithuania
4747,ARGUMENT,we will make a stir by an expedition such as has not been heard of for
4748,ARGUMENT,many a long day. And we shall enjoy it ourselves. For two years have I
4749,ARGUMENT,"been abiding here, and what fighting have I ever seen? With boors over a"
4750,ARGUMENT,"boundary line! Our expedition, however, promises bloodshed; in one such I"
4751,ARGUMENT,took part during my travels. When I tarried in Sicily with a certain
4752,ARGUMENT,"Prince, brigands bore away his son-in-law into the mountains, and"
4753,ARGUMENT,"insolently demanded a ransom from his kinsfolk; we, hastily gathering our"
4754,ARGUMENT,"servants and vassals, attacked them: I killed two robbers with mine own"
4755,ARGUMENT,"hand; I was the first to break into their camp; I freed the prisoner. Ah,"
4756,ARGUMENT,"my Gerwazy, how triumphant, how beautiful was our return, in"
4757,ARGUMENT,knightly-feudal style! The populace met us with flowers--the daughter of
4758,ARGUMENT,"the Prince, grateful to the deliverer, with tears fell into my embraces."
4759,ARGUMENT,"When I arrived at Palermo, they knew of it from the gazette, and all the"
4760,ARGUMENT,"women pointed at me. They even printed a romance about the whole event,"
4761,ARGUMENT,"where I am mentioned by name. The romance is entitled, _The Count; or, The"
4762,ARGUMENT,Mysteries of the Castle of Birbante-Rocca_. Are there dungeons in this
4763,ARGUMENT,"castle?"""
4764,ARGUMENT,
4765,ARGUMENT,"""There are immense beer-cellars,"" said the Warden, ""but empty, for the"
4766,ARGUMENT,"Soplicas have drunk up the wine!"""
4767,ARGUMENT,
4768,ARGUMENT,"""We must arm the jockeys on the estate,"" added the Count, ""and summon the"
4769,ARGUMENT,"vassals from the village."""
4770,ARGUMENT,
4771,ARGUMENT,"""Lackeys? God forbid!"" interrupted Gerwazy. ""Is a foray a drunk and"
4772,ARGUMENT,disorderly affair? Who ever heard of making a foray with boors and
4773,ARGUMENT,"lackeys? Sir, you know nothing at all about forays! Vassals, that is,"
4774,ARGUMENT,"mustachioed champions,98 are something quite different; vassals of that"
4775,ARGUMENT,"sort can be found. But we must not look for them in the peasant villages,"
4776,ARGUMENT,"but through the hamlets of the gentry, in Dobrzyn, in Rzezikow, in"
4777,ARGUMENT,"Cientycze, in Rombanki;99 the gentry of ancient lineage, in whom flows"
4778,ARGUMENT,"knightly blood, are all well disposed to the family of the Horeszkos, and"
4779,ARGUMENT,are all mortal enemies of the Soplicas! Thence I will collect some three
4780,ARGUMENT,hundred mustachioed gentlemen; that is my affair. Do you return to your
4781,ARGUMENT,"mansion and sleep your fill, for to-morrow there will be hard work; you"
4782,ARGUMENT,"are fond of sleeping, it is already late, the second cock is already"
4783,ARGUMENT,"crowing. I will guard the castle here until day breaks, and at sunrise I"
4784,ARGUMENT,"shall be in the hamlet of Dobrzyn."""
4785,ARGUMENT,
4786,ARGUMENT,"At these words the Count withdrew from the balcony, but before he departed"
4787,ARGUMENT,"he glanced through the opening of an embrasure, and exclaimed, seeing a"
4788,ARGUMENT,"multitude of lights in the household of the Soplicas, ""Illuminate if you"
4789,ARGUMENT,"will! To-morrow at this time it will be bright in this castle, but dark in"
4790,ARGUMENT,"your mansion."""
4791,ARGUMENT,
4792,ARGUMENT,"Gerwazy sat down upon the floor, leaned against the wall, and bent down"
4793,ARGUMENT,his thought-laden brow towards his breast. The light of the moon fell on
4794,ARGUMENT,"his bald pate, and Gerwazy drew upon it various patterns with his finger;"
4795,ARGUMENT,it was evident that he was spinning warlike plans for future expeditions.
4796,ARGUMENT,His heavy lids were more and more weighed down; his head nodded on his
4797,ARGUMENT,"powerless neck; he felt that sleep was overcoming him, and began according"
4798,ARGUMENT,to his wont his evening prayers. But between the Pater Noster and the Ave
4799,ARGUMENT,"Maria arose strange phantoms, wavering, and jostling each other: the"
4800,ARGUMENT,"Warden sees the Horeszkos, his ancient lords; some carry sabres, and"
4801,ARGUMENT,"others maces;100 each gazes menacingly and twirls his mustache,"
4802,ARGUMENT,flourishing his sabre or brandishing his mace--after them flashed one
4803,ARGUMENT,"silent, gloomy shadow, with a bloody spot upon its breast. Gerwazy"
4804,ARGUMENT,"shuddered, he had recognised the Pantler; he began to cross himself, and,"
4805,ARGUMENT,"the more surely to drive away his terrible visions, he recited the litany"
4806,ARGUMENT,for souls in Purgatory. Again his eyes closed fast and his ears rang--he
4807,ARGUMENT,"sees a throng of mounted gentry; their sabres glitter: ""The foray, the"
4808,ARGUMENT,"foray against Korelicze, and Rymsza at the head!"" And he beholds himself,"
4809,ARGUMENT,"how he flies on a grey horse, with his dreadful sword uplifted above his"
4810,ARGUMENT,"head; his taratatka,101 opened wide, rustles in the breeze; his red plumed"
4811,ARGUMENT,"hat has fallen backward from his left ear; he flies on, and upon the road"
4812,ARGUMENT,"overthrows both horsemen and foot-travellers, and finally he burns the"
4813,ARGUMENT,"Soplica in his barn. Then his head, heavy with its musings, drooped upon"
4814,ARGUMENT,"his breast, and thus fell asleep the last Warden of the Horeszkos."

4831,ARGUMENT,
4832,ARGUMENT,Imperceptibly there crept forth from the moist darkness a dawn with no red
4833,ARGUMENT,"glow, bringing on a day with no brightness in its eye. It was day long"
4834,ARGUMENT,"since, and yet one could hardly see. The mist hung over the earth like a"
4835,ARGUMENT,straw thatch over the poor hut of a Lithuanian; towards the east one could
4836,ARGUMENT,"see from a somewhat whiter circle in the sky that the sun had risen, and"
4837,ARGUMENT,that thence it must once more descend to the earth; but it did not advance
4838,ARGUMENT,gaily and it slumbered on the road.
4839,ARGUMENT,
4840,ARGUMENT,"Following the example of the sky, everything was late on earth; the cattle"
4841,ARGUMENT,"started late to pasture, and caught the hares at a late breakfast. These"
4842,ARGUMENT,"usually returned to the groves at dawn: to-day, covered by the thick fog,"
4843,ARGUMENT,"some were nibbling duckweed; others, gathered in pairs, were digging holes"
4844,ARGUMENT,"in the field, and thought to enjoy themselves in the open air; but the"
4845,ARGUMENT,cattle drove them back to the forest.
4846,ARGUMENT,
4847,ARGUMENT,"Even in the forest there was quiet. The birds on awakening did not sing,"
4848,ARGUMENT,"but shook the dew from their feathers, hugged the trees, tucked their"
4849,ARGUMENT,"heads under their wings, closed their eyes again, and awaited the sun."
4850,ARGUMENT,Somewhere on the borders of a swamp a stork clacked with its bill; on the
4851,ARGUMENT,"haycocks sat drenched ravens, which, with open beaks, poured forth"
4852,ARGUMENT,ceaseless chatter--hateful to the farmers as an omen of damp weather. The
4853,ARGUMENT,farmers had long since gone out to work.
4854,ARGUMENT,
4855,ARGUMENT,"The women, reaping, had already begun their usual song, gloomy,"
4856,ARGUMENT,"melancholy, and monotonous as a rainy day, all the sadder since its sound"
4857,ARGUMENT,"soaked into the mist without an echo; the sickles clinked in the grain,"
4858,ARGUMENT,and the meadow resounded. A line of mowers cutting the rowen whistled
4859,ARGUMENT,"ceaselessly a jingling tune; at the end of each swath they stopped,"
4860,ARGUMENT,"sharpened their scythes, and rhythmically hammered them. The people could"
4861,ARGUMENT,"not be seen in the mist; only the sickles, the scythes, and the songs"
4862,ARGUMENT,hummed together like the notes of invisible music.
4863,ARGUMENT,
4864,ARGUMENT,"In the centre, the Steward, seated on a pile of grain, turned his head"
4865,ARGUMENT,"gloomily, and did not look at the work; he was gazing on the highway, at"
4866,ARGUMENT,"the cross-roads, where something unusual was going on."
4867,ARGUMENT,
4868,ARGUMENT,On the highway and in the byways since early dawn there had been unusual
4869,ARGUMENT,"animation; from one side a peasant's waggon creaked, flying like a"
4870,ARGUMENT,"post-chaise; from another a gentleman's gig ratded at full gallop, and met"
4871,ARGUMENT,a second and a third; from the left-hand road a messenger rushed like a
4872,ARGUMENT,"courier, from the right raced a dozen horses; all were hurrying, though"
4873,ARGUMENT,they were headed in different directions. What could this mean? The
4874,ARGUMENT,"Steward arose from the pile. He wished to look into the matter, to make"
4875,ARGUMENT,"inquiries; he stood long on the road, and shouted vainly, but could stop"
4876,ARGUMENT,"no one, nor even recognise any one in the fog. The riders flashed by like"
4877,ARGUMENT,spirits; there could only be heard from time to time the dull sound of
4878,ARGUMENT,"hoofs, and, what was stranger yet, the clank of sabres; this greatly"
4879,ARGUMENT,"rejoiced the Steward and yet it terrified him: for, though at that time"
4880,ARGUMENT,"there was peace in Lithuania, dull rumours of war had long been current,"
4881,ARGUMENT,"of the French, Dombrowski, and Napoleon. Were these horsemen and these"
4882,ARGUMENT,"arms an omen of wars? The Steward ran to tell all to the Judge, hoping"
4883,ARGUMENT,likewise to learn something himself.
4884,ARGUMENT,
4885,ARGUMENT,"At Soplicowo the inmates of the house and the guests, after the brawl of"
4886,ARGUMENT,"the day before, had arisen gloomy and discontented with themselves. In"
4887,ARGUMENT,vain the Seneschal's daughter invited the ladies to tell fortunes with
4888,ARGUMENT,cards; in vain they suggested a game of marriage to the gentlemen. They
4889,ARGUMENT,"would not amuse themselves or play, but sat silently in the corners; the"
4890,ARGUMENT,"men smoked pipes, the women knitted; even the flies were asleep. The"
4891,ARGUMENT,"Seneschal, who had thrown aside his flapper, was bored by the silence and"
4892,ARGUMENT,went to join the servants; he preferred to listen in the kitchen to the
4893,ARGUMENT,"cries of the housekeeper, the threats and blows of the cook, the noise of"
4894,ARGUMENT,the serving boys; at last the monotonous motion of the spits that turned
4895,ARGUMENT,the roast gradually caused him to fall into pleasant musings.
4896,ARGUMENT,
4897,ARGUMENT,"Since early morning the Judge had been writing, locked in his room; since"
4898,ARGUMENT,"early morning the Apparitor had been waiting beneath the window, on a"
4899,ARGUMENT,"bench of turf. After finishing his summons, the Judge called in Protazy"
4900,ARGUMENT,"and read in a loud voice his complaint against the Count, for wounding his"
4901,ARGUMENT,"honour and for insulting expressions, and against Gerwazy, for violence"
4902,ARGUMENT,and blows; both of them he cited before the criminal court in the district
4903,ARGUMENT,town for threats--and to pay the costs of the lawsuit between them. The
4904,ARGUMENT,"summons must be served that very day, by word of mouth, in presence of the"
4905,ARGUMENT,"parties, before the sun went down. As soon as he caught sight of the"
4906,ARGUMENT,"summons, the Apparitor extended his hand and listened with a solemn air;"
4907,ARGUMENT,"he stood there with dignity, but he would have been glad to jump for joy."
4908,ARGUMENT,At the very thought of the lawsuit he felt himself young again; he
4909,ARGUMENT,"remembered those years long gone by, when he used to serve many a summons,"
4910,ARGUMENT,"sure to receive bruises in return, but at the same time generous pay. Thus"
4911,ARGUMENT,"a soldier who has passed his life waging war, and in his old age rests"
4912,ARGUMENT,"crippled in a hospital, as soon as he hears a trumpet or a distant drum,"
4913,ARGUMENT,"starts up from his bed, cries in his sleep, ""Smite the Muscovites!"" and on"
4914,ARGUMENT,his wooden leg rushes from the hospital so quickly that young men can
4915,ARGUMENT,hardly catch him.
4916,ARGUMENT,
4917,ARGUMENT,Protazy hastened to put on his apparitor's costume; he did not however don
4918,ARGUMENT,his tunic or his kontusz: those were reserved for the pomp and ceremony of
4919,ARGUMENT,the court sessions. For the journey he had different clothes: broad riding
4920,ARGUMENT,"trousers, and a coat, of which the skirts could be buttoned up or let fall"
4921,ARGUMENT,"over the knees; a cap with ear flaps, tied up with a string--they could be"
4922,ARGUMENT,raised for fine weather and let down in case of rain. Thus clad he took
4923,ARGUMENT,"his cane and set out on foot, for apparitors before a lawsuit, as spies"
4924,ARGUMENT,"before battle, must hide under various forms and costumes."
4925,ARGUMENT,
4926,ARGUMENT,"Protazy did well in hastening to depart, for he would have had no long"
4927,ARGUMENT,comfort from his summons. In Soplicowo they changed their plans of
4928,ARGUMENT,"campaign. Robak, thoughtful and perplexed, suddenly broke in upon the"
4929,ARGUMENT,Judge and said:--
4930,ARGUMENT,
4931,ARGUMENT,"""Judge, we shall have trouble with that aunt, with that giddy-pated"
4932,ARGUMENT,"coquette, Telimena. When Zosia was left alone, a child and poor, Jacek"
4933,ARGUMENT,"gave her to Telimena to be brought up, hearing that she was a good sort of"
4934,ARGUMENT,woman and knew the world; but I notice that she is stirring things up for
4935,ARGUMENT,us here; she is intriguing and seems to be flirting with Thaddeus. I have
4936,ARGUMENT,"my eye on her. Or perhaps she is aiming at the Count, perhaps at both at"
4937,ARGUMENT,"once. So let us think over how to get rid of her, for from her actions may"
4938,ARGUMENT,"arise gossip, a bad example, and quarrels among the youngsters, which may"
4939,ARGUMENT,"be a hindrance to your legal negotiations."""
4940,ARGUMENT,
4941,ARGUMENT,"""Negotiations?"" cried the Judge with unusual warmth, ""I'm done with"
4942,ARGUMENT,"negotiations; I've finished with them, broken them off."""
4943,ARGUMENT,
4944,ARGUMENT,"""What's this?"" interrupted Robak, ""where's your sense, where's your head?"
4945,ARGUMENT,"What nonsense are you telling me? What new row has come up?"""
4946,ARGUMENT,
4947,ARGUMENT,"""It is not my fault,"" said the Judge; ""the trial will make the matter"
4948,ARGUMENT,"plain. That pompous, stupid Count was the cause of the squabble, and that"
4949,ARGUMENT,rascal Gerwazy; but this is the business of the court. It is too bad that
4950,ARGUMENT,"you were not in the castle at the supper, Father; you would have borne"
4951,ARGUMENT,"witness how fearfully the Count insulted me."""
4952,ARGUMENT,
4953,ARGUMENT,"""My dear sir,"" cried Robak, ""why did you insist on going to those ruins?"
4954,ARGUMENT,You know that I cannot stand the castle; henceforth I will never set foot
4955,ARGUMENT,there again. Another brawl! The judgment of God be on us! How did it
4956,ARGUMENT,happen? Tell me! This matter must be hushed up. I am sick already of
4957,ARGUMENT,seeing so many acts of folly; I have more important business than to
4958,ARGUMENT,"reconcile litigious squabblers; but I will reconcile you once again."""
4959,ARGUMENT,
4960,ARGUMENT,"""Reconcile? What do you mean! Go to the devil with your reconciliation!"""
4961,ARGUMENT,"interrupted the Judge, stamping his foot. ""Look at this monk! Because I"
4962,ARGUMENT,"receive him courteously, he wants to lead me by the nose. Pray understand"
4963,ARGUMENT,that the Soplicas are not wont to be reconciled; when they summon a man to
4964,ARGUMENT,court they must win their case. Sometimes a suit has continued in their
4965,ARGUMENT,name until they won it in the sixth generation. I committed folly enough
4966,ARGUMENT,by your advice when I convoked for the third time the Chamberlain's court.
4967,ARGUMENT,"From this day on there shall be no compromise, none, none, none!"" (As he"
4968,ARGUMENT,"shouted these words he walked up and down and stamped both feet.) ""Besides"
4969,ARGUMENT,"that, he must beg my pardon for his discourteous act of yesterday, or"
4970,ARGUMENT,"fight a duel!"""
4971,ARGUMENT,
4972,ARGUMENT,"""But, Judge, what will happen if Jacek learns of this? He will certainly"
4973,ARGUMENT,die of despair! Have not the Soplicas done evil enough in this castle?
4974,ARGUMENT,"Brother, I do not wish to mention that terrible event, but you too know"
4975,ARGUMENT,that the Targowica confederates103 took a part of the estate from the
4976,ARGUMENT,"owner of the castle and gave it to the Soplicas. Jacek, repenting his sin,"
4977,ARGUMENT,"had to vow, when absolved, to restore those lands. So he took Zosia, the"
4978,ARGUMENT,"poor heiress of the Horeszkos, under his care, and he paid a great price"
4979,ARGUMENT,"for her bringing up. He wished to win her for his own son Thaddeus, and"
4980,ARGUMENT,"thus unite in brotherly affection two hostile houses, and yield without"
4981,ARGUMENT,"shame to the heiress what had been plundered from her."""
4982,ARGUMENT,
4983,ARGUMENT,"""But what have I to do with all this?"" cried the Judge. ""I have never been"
4984,ARGUMENT,acquainted with Jacek--have not even seen him; I had scarcely heard of his
4985,ARGUMENT,"riotous life, since I was then studying rhetoric in a Jesuit school, and"
4986,ARGUMENT,later served as page with the Wojewoda. They gave me the estate and I took
4987,ARGUMENT,"it; he told me to receive Zosia, and I received her and cared for her, and"
4988,ARGUMENT,am planning for her future. I am weary enough of all this old wives' tale!
4989,ARGUMENT,And then why did this Count intrude upon me here? With what right to the
4990,ARGUMENT,"castle? You know, my friend, he's only some sixteenth cousin to the"
4991,ARGUMENT,"Horeszkos, the tenth water on the kisiel.104 And he must insult me? and I"
4992,ARGUMENT,"invite him to a reconciliation!"""
4993,ARGUMENT,
4994,ARGUMENT,"""Brother,"" said the Monk, ""there are weighty reasons for this. You"
4995,ARGUMENT,"remember that Jacek wanted to send his son to the army, but later let him"
4996,ARGUMENT,"remain in Lithuania: what reason was there for that? Why, at home he will"
4997,ARGUMENT,be more useful to his country. You have surely heard the news of which
4998,ARGUMENT,"every one is talking, and of which I have often brought tidings: now is"
4999,ARGUMENT,"the time to tell it all, now is the time! An important matter, my brother!"
5000,ARGUMENT,"Now the war is upon us! A war for Poland, brother! We shall be Poles once"
5001,ARGUMENT,"more! War is inevitable. When I hurried here on a secret mission, the"
5002,ARGUMENT,vanguard of the army was already on the Niemen. Napoleon is already
5003,ARGUMENT,"gathering an immense army, such as man has never seen and history does not"
5004,ARGUMENT,"remember; by the side of the French the whole Polish army is advancing,"
5005,ARGUMENT,"our Joseph,105 our Dombrowski, our white eagles! They are already on the"
5006,ARGUMENT,"march, at the first sign from Napoleon they will cross the Niemen; and,"
5007,ARGUMENT,"brother, our Fatherland will be restored!"""
5008,ARGUMENT,
5009,ARGUMENT,"The Judge, as he listened, slowly folded his spectacles, and gazed fixedly"
5010,ARGUMENT,"at the Monk, but said nothing; he sighed deeply, and tears stood in his"
5011,ARGUMENT,"eyes--finally he clasped Robak about the neck with all his might,"
5012,ARGUMENT,exclaiming:--
5013,ARGUMENT,
5014,ARGUMENT,"""My Robak, is this really true? My Robak,"" he repeated, ""is this really"
5015,ARGUMENT,"true? How many times they have deceived us! Do you remember, they said"
5016,ARGUMENT,"that Napoleon was already on the road? And we were waiting! They said, he"
5017,ARGUMENT,"is already in the Kingdom,106 he has already beaten the Prussians, and is"
5018,ARGUMENT,coming in among us! And what did he do? He made peace at Tilsit.107 Is it
5019,ARGUMENT,"really true? Are you not deceiving yourself?"""
5020,ARGUMENT,
5021,ARGUMENT,"""It is the truth,"" cried Robak, ""as God is in Heaven!"""
5022,ARGUMENT,
5023,ARGUMENT,"""Blessed be the lips that bring these tidings!"" said the Judge, raising"
5024,ARGUMENT,"his hands on high. ""You shall not regret your mission, Robak; your"
5025,ARGUMENT,monastery shall not regret it; two hundred choice sheep I give to your
5026,ARGUMENT,"monastery. Monk, yesterday you expressed a desire for my chestnut and"
5027,ARGUMENT,praised my bay; to-day the two shall at once be harnessed to the waggon in
5028,ARGUMENT,"which you gather alms. To-day ask me for what you wish, for whatever"
5029,ARGUMENT,"pleases you, and I will not refuse! But as to all that business with the"
5030,ARGUMENT,"Count, let me alone; he has wronged me, I have already summoned him to"
5031,ARGUMENT,"court--is it fitting that I should propose an accommodation?"""
5032,ARGUMENT,
5033,ARGUMENT,The astonished Monk wrung his hands. Fixing his eyes upon the Judge and
5034,ARGUMENT,"shrugging his shoulders, he said:--"
5035,ARGUMENT,
5036,ARGUMENT,"""So, when Napoleon is bringing liberty to Lithuania, when all the world"
5037,ARGUMENT,"trembles, then you are thinking of your lawsuit? And after all that I have"
5038,ARGUMENT,"told you will you sit calmly, folding your hands, when one must act?"""
5039,ARGUMENT,
5040,ARGUMENT,"""Act? How?"" asked the Judge."
5041,ARGUMENT,
5042,ARGUMENT,"""Have you not yet read it in my eyes?"" replied Robak. ""Does your heart"
5043,ARGUMENT,"still tell you nothing? Ah, brother, if you have one drop of the Soplicas'"
5044,ARGUMENT,"blood in your veins, just consider: the French are striking from in"
5045,ARGUMENT,front--what if we stir up a rising of the people from the rear? What do you
5046,ARGUMENT,"think? Let our Warhorse neigh, let the Bear roar in Zmudz!108 Ah, if only"
5047,ARGUMENT,"a thousand men, if but five hundred should press from behind upon the"
5048,ARGUMENT,"Muscovites, and spread abroad the rising like fire; if we, seizing cannon"
5049,ARGUMENT,"and standards from the Muscovites, should go as conquerors to greet the"
5050,ARGUMENT,"deliverers of our kinsmen? We advance! Napoleon, seeing our lances, asks,"
5051,ARGUMENT,"'What army is that?' We shout, 'The insurgents, Most August Emperor; the"
5052,ARGUMENT,"volunteers of Lithuania!' He asks, 'Who is their commander?'--'Judge"
5053,ARGUMENT,"Soplica!' Ah, who then would dare to breathe a word of Targowica? Brother,"
5054,ARGUMENT,"while Ponary stands, while the Niemen flows, so long will the name of the"
5055,ARGUMENT,Soplicas be famous in Lithuania; to their grandsons and great-grandsons
5056,ARGUMENT,"the capital of the Jagiellos109 will point, saying, 'There is a Soplica,"
5057,ARGUMENT,"one of those Soplicas who first started the revolt.' """
5058,ARGUMENT,
5059,ARGUMENT,"""People's talk is of small account,"" answered the Judge. ""I have never"
5060,ARGUMENT,greatly cared for the praises of the world. God is my witness that I am
5061,ARGUMENT,"innocent of my brother's sins; in politics I have never meddled much, but"
5062,ARGUMENT,have performed the duties of my office and ploughed my patch of ground.
5063,ARGUMENT,"But I am a gentleman by birth, and should be glad to wipe out the blot on"
5064,ARGUMENT,"my escutcheon; I am a Pole, and should be glad to do some service for my"
5065,ARGUMENT,"country--even to lay down my life. With the sabre I was never over skilled,"
5066,ARGUMENT,and yet some men have received slashes even from me. The world knows that
5067,ARGUMENT,at the time of the last Polish district assemblies I challenged and
5068,ARGUMENT,"wounded the two brothers Buzwik, who---- But enough of this. What is your"
5069,ARGUMENT,"idea, sir? Should we take the field at once? To gather musketeers is easy;"
5070,ARGUMENT,"I have plenty of powder, and at the parish house the priest has some small"
5071,ARGUMENT,cannon; I remember that Jankiel has told me that he has some points for
5072,ARGUMENT,"lances, which I may take in case of need. He smuggled these lance-points"
5073,ARGUMENT,"in cases of goods, from Königsberg; we will take them, and make shafts at"
5074,ARGUMENT,"once. There will be no lack of sabres; the gentry will mount their steeds,"
5075,ARGUMENT,"my nephew and I at the head, and----? Somehow we'll manage it!"""
5076,ARGUMENT,
5077,ARGUMENT,"""O Polish blood!"" exclaimed the Bernardine with emotion, leaping towards"
5078,ARGUMENT,"the Judge with open arms; ""true child of the Soplicas! God ordains you to"
5079,ARGUMENT,"wipe out the sins of your vagabond brother. I have always respected you,"
5080,ARGUMENT,"but from this instant I love you, as though we were own brothers. Let us"
5081,ARGUMENT,"prepare everything, but it is not yet time to take the field; I myself"
5082,ARGUMENT,will indicate the place and will inform you of the time. I know that the
5083,ARGUMENT,Tsar has sent messengers to Napoleon to ask for peace; the war is not yet
5084,ARGUMENT,"proclaimed. But Prince Joseph has heard from Pan Bignon,110 a Frenchman, a"
5085,ARGUMENT,"member of the Imperial Council, that all these negotiations will come to"
5086,ARGUMENT,"nothing, that there will be war. The Prince sent me as a scout with"
5087,ARGUMENT,instructions that the Lithuanians should be ready to announce to Napoleon
5088,ARGUMENT,"when he came that they wish to unite anew with their sister, the Kingdom,"
5089,ARGUMENT,"and desire that Poland be restored. Meanwhile, brother, you must be"
5090,ARGUMENT,"reconciled with the Count; he is a crank, a trifle fantastic in his"
5091,ARGUMENT,"notions, but he is a good, honest young Pole; we need such; cranks are"
5092,ARGUMENT,"very necessary in revolutions, as I know from experience; even stupid"
5093,ARGUMENT,"fellows will be of service, so long as they are honest and under the"
5094,ARGUMENT,"authority of clever men. The Count is a magnate, and has great influence"
5095,ARGUMENT,among the gentry; the whole district will rise if he joins the revolt;
5096,ARGUMENT,"knowing his estate, every gentleman will say, 'It must be a sure thing,"
5097,ARGUMENT,"since the magnates are in it; I will join directly.' """
5098,ARGUMENT,
5099,ARGUMENT,"""Let him make the first move,"" said the Judge, ""let him come here, let him"
5100,ARGUMENT,"beg my pardon. At any rate I am older than he, and hold an office! As for"
5101,ARGUMENT,"the lawsuit, we will refer it to arbitration."""
5102,ARGUMENT,
5103,ARGUMENT,The Bernardine slammed the door.
5104,ARGUMENT,
5105,ARGUMENT,"""Well, a happy journey to you!"" said the Judge."
5106,ARGUMENT,
5107,ARGUMENT,"The Monk mounted a vehicle standing by the threshold, lashed the horses"
5108,ARGUMENT,"with the whip, tickled their sides with the reins, and the carriage flew"
5109,ARGUMENT,off and vanished in billows of fog; only now and then the grey cowl of the
5110,ARGUMENT,Monk rose above the mist like a vulture above the clouds.
5111,ARGUMENT,
5112,ARGUMENT,The Apparitor had long ago arrived at the Count's house. As an experienced
5113,ARGUMENT,"fox, when the scent of bacon allures it, runs towards it but bears in mind"
5114,ARGUMENT,"the secret tricks of hunters; it runs, stops, sits up frequently, raises"
5115,ARGUMENT,"its brush, and with it as with a fan waves the breeze to its nostrils, and"
5116,ARGUMENT,asks the breeze whether the hunters have not poisoned the food: so Protazy
5117,ARGUMENT,left the road and circled over the meadow around the house; he twirled his
5118,ARGUMENT,stick in his hand and pretended that he had somewhere seen some stray
5119,ARGUMENT,cattle; thus skilfully manoeuvring he arrived close to the garden; he bent
5120,ARGUMENT,down and ran so that you would have said that he was trailing a land rail;
5121,ARGUMENT,then he suddenly jumped over the fence and plunged into the hemp.
5122,ARGUMENT,
5123,ARGUMENT,"In that thick, green, fragrant growth around the house there is a sure"
5124,ARGUMENT,"refuge for beasts and men. Often a hare, caught among the cabbages, leaps"
5125,ARGUMENT,"to find surer hiding in the hemp than in the shrubbery, for among the"
5126,ARGUMENT,"close-set stalks no greyhound can catch it, nor foxhound smell it out"
5127,ARGUMENT,"because of the strong odour. In the hemp a serving man, fleeing from the"
5128,ARGUMENT,"whip or the fist, sits quietly until his master has spent his wrath. And"
5129,ARGUMENT,"often even runaway peasant recruits, while the government is tracking them"
5130,ARGUMENT,"in the woods, are sitting in the hemp. And hence at the time of battles,"
5131,ARGUMENT,"forays, and confiscations, each side uses immense exertions to occupy a"
5132,ARGUMENT,"position in the hemp, which commonly extends forward to the walls of the"
5133,ARGUMENT,"mansion, and backward until it joins the hop fields, and thus covers their"
5134,ARGUMENT,attack and retreat from the enemy.
5135,ARGUMENT,
5136,ARGUMENT,"Protazy, though a bold fellow, felt some terror, for the very smell of the"
5137,ARGUMENT,leaves called to his mind various of his former adventures as
5138,ARGUMENT,apparitor--one after another--of which the hemp had been a witness: how once
5139,ARGUMENT,"a gentleman of Telsze, Dzindolet, whom he had summoned to court, had put a"
5140,ARGUMENT,"pistol against his breast, and bidden him crawl under the table and from"
5141,ARGUMENT,"there bark out a recantation of that summons with a dog's voice,111 so"
5142,ARGUMENT,that the Apparitor had to run full speed for the hemp; how later
5143,ARGUMENT,"Wolodkowicz,112 a haughty and insolent grandee, who used to break up"
5144,ARGUMENT,"district diets and violate courts of justice, receiving his official"
5145,ARGUMENT,"summons, had torn it into bits, and stationing footmen with clubs at the"
5146,ARGUMENT,"doors, had with his own hand held a bare sword over the Apparitor's head,"
5147,ARGUMENT,"crying: ""Either I will cut you down or you will eat your paper."" The"
5148,ARGUMENT,"Apparitor, like a cautious man, had pretended to begin to eat it, until,"
5149,ARGUMENT,"stealing up to the window, he had plunged into the hemp garden."
5150,ARGUMENT,
5151,ARGUMENT,"To be sure, at this time it was no longer the custom in Lithuania to"
5152,ARGUMENT,"defend oneself from a summons with the sabre or the whip, and an apparitor"
5153,ARGUMENT,only got cursed now and then for his pains; but Protazy could not know of
5154,ARGUMENT,"that change of customs, for it was long since he had carried any summons."
5155,ARGUMENT,"Though he was always ready, though he himself had begged the Judge to let"
5156,ARGUMENT,"him, up till now the Judge, from a due regard for his advanced age, had"
5157,ARGUMENT,refused his requests; to-day he had accepted his offer because of pressing
5158,ARGUMENT,need.
5159,ARGUMENT,
5160,ARGUMENT,The Apparitor gazed and listened--all was quiet--slowly he thrust forward
5161,ARGUMENT,"his hand through the hemp, and, separating the dense mass of stalks, swam"
5162,ARGUMENT,through the greenery as a fisherman dives beneath the water. He raised his
5163,ARGUMENT,head--all was quiet--he stole up to the windows--all was quiet--through the
5164,ARGUMENT,windows he surveyed the interior of the mansion--all was empty. He stepped
5165,ARGUMENT,"up on the porch, not without terror, and undid the latch--all was empty as"
5166,ARGUMENT,"in an enchanted house; he took out his summons, and read aloud the"
5167,ARGUMENT,"notification. But suddenly he heard a clatter, and felt a trembling of the"
5168,ARGUMENT,"heart, and wanted to run away; when from the door there came towards him a"
5169,ARGUMENT,person--luckily well known to him! Robak! Both were surprised.
5170,ARGUMENT,
5171,ARGUMENT,"Evidently the Count had departed somewhere with all his train, and in a"
5172,ARGUMENT,"great hurry, for he had left the doors open. It was evident that he had"
5173,ARGUMENT,been arming himself; on the floor lay double-barrelled muskets and
5174,ARGUMENT,"carbines, besides ramrods and gunhammers and locksmith's tools with which"
5175,ARGUMENT,they had been repairing the arms. There were also gunpowder and paper;
5176,ARGUMENT,they had been making cartridges. Had the Count gone hunting with all his
5177,ARGUMENT,"train? But why should he take hand arms? Here lay a rusty, hiltless sabre,"
5178,ARGUMENT,there a sword with no belt; they must have been selecting weapons from
5179,ARGUMENT,"this rubbish, and have ransacked even the old armouries. Robak surveyed"
5180,ARGUMENT,"with care the guns and swords, and then went out to the farmhouse to"
5181,ARGUMENT,"explore, looking for servants of whom he might inquire about the Count. In"
5182,ARGUMENT,"the deserted farmhouse he at length found two peasant women, from whom he"
5183,ARGUMENT,"learned that the master and his whole household had departed in a body,"
5184,ARGUMENT,"armed, along the road to Dobrzyn."
5185,ARGUMENT,
5186,ARGUMENT,The hamlet of Dobrzyn has a wide reputation in Lithuania for the bravery
5187,ARGUMENT,of its gentlemen and the beauty of its gentlewomen. It was once powerful
5188,ARGUMENT,"and populous, for when King Jan III. Sobieski had summoned the general"
5189,ARGUMENT,"militia by the ""twigs,""113 the ensign of the wojewodeship had led to him"
5190,ARGUMENT,from Dobrzyn alone six hundred armed gentry. The family had now grown
5191,ARGUMENT,"small and poor; formerly at the courts of the magnates or in their troops,"
5192,ARGUMENT,"at forays, and at the district assemblies the Dobrzynskis used to find an"
5193,ARGUMENT,"easy living. Now they were forced to work for themselves, like mere serfs,"
5194,ARGUMENT,"except that they did not wear peasants' russet doublets, but long white"
5195,ARGUMENT,"coats with black stripes, and on Sunday kontuszes. Also the dress of even"
5196,ARGUMENT,the poorest of their women was different from the jackets of the peasants;
5197,ARGUMENT,"they usually wore drilling or percale, herded their cattle in shoes not of"
5198,ARGUMENT,"bark but of leather, and reaped and even spun with gloves on."
5199,ARGUMENT,
5200,ARGUMENT,The Dobrzynskis were distinguished among their Lithuanian brethren by
5201,ARGUMENT,their language and likewise by their stature and their appearance. They
5202,ARGUMENT,"were of pure Polish blood, and all had black hair, high foreheads, black"
5203,ARGUMENT,"eyes, and aquiline noses. From the land of Dobrzyn114 they derived their"
5204,ARGUMENT,"ancient family, and, though they had been settled in Lithuania for four"
5205,ARGUMENT,"hundred years, they preserved their Masovian speech and customs. Whenever"
5206,ARGUMENT,"any one of them gave his son a name at baptism, he always used to choose"
5207,ARGUMENT,"as a patron a saint of the Kingdom, either Bartholomew or Matthias"
5208,ARGUMENT,"[Matyasz]. Thus the son of Maciej was always called Bardomiej,115 and"
5209,ARGUMENT,again the son of Bartlomiej was called Maciej; the women were all
5210,ARGUMENT,christened Kachna or Maryna. In order to distinguish themselves amid such
5211,ARGUMENT,"confusion, they took various nicknames, from some merit or defect, both"
5212,ARGUMENT,"men and women. Sometimes they would give a man several surnames, as a mark"
5213,ARGUMENT,of the contempt or of the regard of his compatriots; sometimes the same
5214,ARGUMENT,"gentleman was known by one name in Dobrzyn, and by a different title in"
5215,ARGUMENT,"the neighbouring hamlets. Imitating the Dobrzynskis, the rest of the"
5216,ARGUMENT,"gentry of the vicinity likewise assumed nicknames, or by-names.116 Now"
5217,ARGUMENT,"almost every family employs them, but only a few know that they originated"
5218,ARGUMENT,"in Dobrzyn, and were necessary there, while in the rest of the country"
5219,ARGUMENT,they became a custom through mere stupid imitation.
5220,ARGUMENT,
5221,ARGUMENT,"So Matyasz Dobrzynski, who was at the head of the whole family, had been"
5222,ARGUMENT,"called Cock-on-the-Steeple. Later, after the year seventeen hundred and"
5223,ARGUMENT,"ninety-four, he changed his nickname and was christened Hand-on-Hip; the"
5224,ARGUMENT,"Dobrzynskis themselves also called him Bunny our King,117 but the"
5225,ARGUMENT,Lithuanians styled him the Maciek of Macieks.
5226,ARGUMENT,
5227,ARGUMENT,"As he over the Dobrzynskis, so his house ruled over the village, standing"
5228,ARGUMENT,between the tavern and the church. To all appearances it was rarely
5229,ARGUMENT,"visited and mere trash lived in it, for at the entrance stood posts"
5230,ARGUMENT,"without gates, and the garden was neither fenced nor planted; in the"
5231,ARGUMENT,vegetable beds birches had grown up. Yet this old farmhouse seemed the
5232,ARGUMENT,"capitol of the village, for it was handsomer and more spacious than the"
5233,ARGUMENT,"other cottages, and on the right side, where the living-room was placed,"
5234,ARGUMENT,"it was of brick. Near by were a storehouse, granary, barn, cow shed, and"
5235,ARGUMENT,"stable, all close together, as is usually the case among the gentry. The"
5236,ARGUMENT,whole was uncommonly old and decayed; the house roofs shone as if made of
5237,ARGUMENT,"green tin, because of the moss and grass, which grew as luxuriantly as on"
5238,ARGUMENT,a prairie. The thatches of the barns were like hanging gardens of various
5239,ARGUMENT,"plants, the nettle and the crimson crocus, the yellow mullen and the"
5240,ARGUMENT,bright-coloured tassels of mercury. In them too were nests of various
5241,ARGUMENT,"birds; in the lofts were dove-cotes, nests of swallows in the windows;"
5242,ARGUMENT,white rabbits hopped about at the threshold and burrowed in the untrodden
5243,ARGUMENT,turf. In a word the place was like a birdcage or a warren.
5244,ARGUMENT,
5245,ARGUMENT,But of old it had been fortified! Everywhere there were plenty of traces
5246,ARGUMENT,that it had undergone great and frequent attacks. Near the gateway there
5247,ARGUMENT,"still lay in the grass a relic of the Swedish invasion, an iron cannon"
5248,ARGUMENT,"ball, as large as a child's head; once the open gate had rested on that"
5249,ARGUMENT,"ball as on a stone. In the yard, among the weeds and the wormwood, rose"
5250,ARGUMENT,"the old stumps of some dozen crosses, on unconsecrated ground, a sign that"
5251,ARGUMENT,here lay buried men who had perished by a sudden and unexpected death.
5252,ARGUMENT,"When one eyed from close by the storehouse, granary, and cottage, he saw"
5253,ARGUMENT,that the walls were peppered from ground to summit as with a swarm of
5254,ARGUMENT,"black insects; in the centre of each spot sat a bullet, like a bumble-bee"
5255,ARGUMENT,in its earthy burrow.
5256,ARGUMENT,
5257,ARGUMENT,"On the doors of the establishment all the latches, nails, and hooks were"
5258,ARGUMENT,either cut off or bore the marks of sabres; evidently here they had tested
5259,ARGUMENT,"the temper of those swords of the time of the Sigismunds, with which one"
5260,ARGUMENT,might boldly cut off the heads of nails or cleave hooks in two without
5261,ARGUMENT,making a notch in the blade. Over the doors could be seen coats of arms of
5262,ARGUMENT,"the Dobrzynskis, but shelves of cheeses veiled the bearings, and swallows"
5263,ARGUMENT,had walled them in thickly with their nests.
5264,ARGUMENT,
5265,ARGUMENT,The interior of the house itself and of the stable and carriage-house you
5266,ARGUMENT,would find as full of accoutrements as an old armoury. Under the roof hung
5267,ARGUMENT,"four immense helmets, the ornaments of martial brows; to-day the birds of"
5268,ARGUMENT,"Venus, the doves, cooing, fed their young in them. In the stable a great"
5269,ARGUMENT,cuirass extended over the manger and a corselet of ring mail served as a
5270,ARGUMENT,chute through which the boy threw down clover to the colts. In the kitchen
5271,ARGUMENT,the godless cook had spoiled the temper of several swords by sticking them
5272,ARGUMENT,"into the oven instead of spits; with a Turkish horsetail, captured at"
5273,ARGUMENT,"Vienna, she dusted her handmill. In a word, housewifely Ceres had banished"
5274,ARGUMENT,"Mars and ruled along with Pomona, Flora, and Vertumnus over Dobrzynski's"
5275,ARGUMENT,"house, stable, and barn. But to-day the goddesses must yield anew; Mars"
5276,ARGUMENT,returns.
5277,ARGUMENT,
5278,ARGUMENT,At daybreak there had appeared in Dobrzyn a mounted messenger; he galloped
5279,ARGUMENT,from cottage to cottage and awoke them as if to work for the manor: the
5280,ARGUMENT,gentry arose and filled with a crowd the streets of the hamlet; cries were
5281,ARGUMENT,"heard in the tavern, candles seen in the priest's house. All were running"
5282,ARGUMENT,"about, each asked the other what this meant; the old men took counsel"
5283,ARGUMENT,"together, the young men saddled their horses while the women held them;"
5284,ARGUMENT,"the boys scuffled about, in a hurry to run and fight, but did not know"
5285,ARGUMENT,"with whom or about what! Willy-nilly, they had to stay behind. In the"
5286,ARGUMENT,"priest's dwelling there was in progress a long, tumultuous, frightfully"
5287,ARGUMENT,"confused debate; at last, not being able to agree, they finally decided to"
5288,ARGUMENT,lay the whole matter before Father Maciej.
5289,ARGUMENT,
5290,ARGUMENT,"Seventy-two years of age was Maciej, a hale old man, of low stature, a"
5291,ARGUMENT,former Confederate of Bar.118 Both his friends and his enemies remembered
5292,ARGUMENT,"his curved damascened sabre, with which he was wont to chop spears and"
5293,ARGUMENT,"bayonets like fodder, and to which in jest he had given the modest name of"
5294,ARGUMENT,"_switch_. From a Confederate he became a partisan of the King, and"
5295,ARGUMENT,"supported Tyzenhaus,119 the Under-Treasurer of Lithuania; but when the"
5296,ARGUMENT,"King joined the men of Targowica, Maciej once more deserted the royal"
5297,ARGUMENT,"side. And hence, since he had passed through so many parties, he had long"
5298,ARGUMENT,"been called Cock-on-the-Steeple, because like a cock he turned his"
5299,ARGUMENT,standard with the wind. You would in vain search for the cause of such
5300,ARGUMENT,"frequent changes; perhaps Maciej was too fond of war, and, when conquered"
5301,ARGUMENT,"on one side, sought battle anew on the other; perhaps the shrewd"
5302,ARGUMENT,"politician judged well the spirit of the times, and turned whither he"
5303,ARGUMENT,thought the good of his country called him.120 Who knows! This much is
5304,ARGUMENT,"sure, that never was he seduced either by desire for personal fame, or by"
5305,ARGUMENT,"base greed, and that never had he supported the Muscovite party; for at"
5306,ARGUMENT,the very sight of a Muscovite he frothed and grimaced. In order not to
5307,ARGUMENT,"meet a Muscovite, after the partition of the country, he sat at home like"
5308,ARGUMENT,a bear that sucks its paw in the woods.
5309,ARGUMENT,
5310,ARGUMENT,"His last experience in war was when he went with Oginski121 to Wilno,"
5311,ARGUMENT,"where they both served under Jasinski, and there with his switch he"
5312,ARGUMENT,performed prodigies of valour. Everybody knew how he had jumped down alone
5313,ARGUMENT,"from the ramparts of Praga to defend Pan Pociej,122 who had been deserted"
5314,ARGUMENT,on the field of battle and had received twenty-three wounds. In Lithuania
5315,ARGUMENT,"they long thought that both had been killed; but both returned, each as"
5316,ARGUMENT,"full of holes as a sieve. Pan Pociej, an honourable man, immediately after"
5317,ARGUMENT,the war had wished to reward generously his defender Dobrzynski; he had
5318,ARGUMENT,"offered him for life a farm of five houses, and assigned him yearly a"
5319,ARGUMENT,"thousand ducats in gold. But Dobrzynski wrote back: ""Let Pociej remain in"
5320,ARGUMENT,"debt to Maciej, and not Maciej to Pociej."" So he refused the farm and"
5321,ARGUMENT,"would not take the money; returning home alone, he lived by the work of"
5322,ARGUMENT,"his own hands, making hives for bees and medicine for cattle, sending to"
5323,ARGUMENT,"market partridges which he caught in snares, and hunting wild beasts."
5324,ARGUMENT,
5325,ARGUMENT,"In Dobrzyn there were numbers of sagacious old men--men versed in Latin,"
5326,ARGUMENT,who from their youth up had practised at the bar; there were numbers of
5327,ARGUMENT,richer men: but of all the family the poor and simple Maciek was the most
5328,ARGUMENT,"highly honoured, not only as a swordsman made famous by his _switch_, but"
5329,ARGUMENT,"as a man of wise and sure judgment, who knew the history of the country"
5330,ARGUMENT,"and the traditions of the family, and was equally well versed in law and"
5331,ARGUMENT,farming. He knew likewise the secrets of hunting and of medicine; they
5332,ARGUMENT,even ascribed to him (though this the priest denied) a knowledge of
5333,ARGUMENT,"higher, superhuman things. This much is sure, that he knew with precision"
5334,ARGUMENT,"the changes of the weather, and could guess them oftener than the farmer's"
5335,ARGUMENT,"almanac. It is no marvel then that, whether it was a question of beginning"
5336,ARGUMENT,"the sowing, or of sending out the river barges, or of reaping the grain;"
5337,ARGUMENT,"whether it was a matter of going to law, or of concluding a compromise,"
5338,ARGUMENT,nothing was done in Dobrzyn without the advice of Maciek. Such influence
5339,ARGUMENT,"the old man did not in the least seek for; on the contrary, he wished to"
5340,ARGUMENT,"be rid of it, scolded his clients, and usually pushed them out of the door"
5341,ARGUMENT,"of his house without opening his lips; he rarely gave advice, and never to"
5342,ARGUMENT,"common men; only in extremely important disputes or agreements, when"
5343,ARGUMENT,"asked, would he utter an opinion--and then in few words. It was thought"
5344,ARGUMENT,that he would undertake to-day's affair and put himself in person at the
5345,ARGUMENT,head of the expedition; for in his youth he had loved a combat beyond
5346,ARGUMENT,"measure, and he was an enemy of the Muscovite race."
5347,ARGUMENT,
5348,ARGUMENT,"The aged man was walking about in his solitary yard, humming a song, ""When"
5349,ARGUMENT,"the early dawn ariseth,""123 and was happy because the weather was"
5350,ARGUMENT,clearing; the mist was not rising up as it usually does when clouds are
5351,ARGUMENT,"gathering, but kept falling: the wind spread forth its palms and stroked"
5352,ARGUMENT,"the mist, smoothed it, and spread it on the meadow; meanwhile the sun from"
5353,ARGUMENT,"on high with a thousand beams pierced the web, silvered it, gilded it,"
5354,ARGUMENT,made it rosy. As when a pair of workmen at Sluck are making a Polish
5355,ARGUMENT,girdle; a girl at the base of the loom smooths and presses the web with
5356,ARGUMENT,"her hands, while the weaver throws her from above threads of silver, gold"
5357,ARGUMENT,"and purple, forming colours and flowers: thus to-day the wind spread all"
5358,ARGUMENT,the earth with mist and the sun embroidered it.
5359,ARGUMENT,
5360,ARGUMENT,"Maciej was warming himself in the sun after finishing his prayers, and was"
5361,ARGUMENT,already setting about his household work. He brought out grass and leaves;
5362,ARGUMENT,he sat down in front of his house and whistled: at this whistle a
5363,ARGUMENT,multitude of rabbits bobbed up from beneath the ground. Like narcissuses
5364,ARGUMENT,"suddenly blooming above the grass, their long ears shine white; beneath"
5365,ARGUMENT,them their bright eyes glitter like bloody rubies thickly sown in the
5366,ARGUMENT,"velvet of the greensward. Now the rabbits sit up, and each listens and"
5367,ARGUMENT,"gazes around; finally the whole white, furry herd run to the old man,"
5368,ARGUMENT,"allured by leaves of cabbage; they jump to his feet, on his knees, on his"
5369,ARGUMENT,"shoulders: himself white as a rabbit, he loves to gather them around him"
5370,ARGUMENT,and stroke their warm fur with his hand; but with his other hand he throws
5371,ARGUMENT,"millet on the grass for the sparrows, and the noisy rabble drop from the"
5372,ARGUMENT,roofs.
5373,ARGUMENT,
5374,ARGUMENT,"While the aged man was amusing himself with the sight of this gathering,"
5375,ARGUMENT,"suddenly the rabbits vanished into the earth, and the flocks of sparrows"
5376,ARGUMENT,"fled to the roof before new guests, who were coming into the yard with"
5377,ARGUMENT,quick steps. These were the envoys whom the assembly of gentry at the
5378,ARGUMENT,priest's house had sent to consult Maciek. Greeting the old man from afar
5379,ARGUMENT,"with low bows, they said: ""Praised be Jesus Christ.""--""For ever and ever,"
5380,ARGUMENT,"amen,""124 answered the old man; and, when he had learned of the importance"
5381,ARGUMENT,"of the embassy, he asked them into his cottage. They entered and sat down"
5382,ARGUMENT,upon a bench. The first of the envoys took his stand in the centre and
5383,ARGUMENT,began to render an account of his mission.
5384,ARGUMENT,
5385,ARGUMENT,Meanwhile more and more of the gentry were arriving; almost all the
5386,ARGUMENT,"Dobrzynskis, and no few of the neighbours from the hamlets near by, armed"
5387,ARGUMENT,"and unarmed, in carts and in carriages, on foot and on horseback. They"
5388,ARGUMENT,"halted their vehicles, tied their nags to the birches, and, curious as to"
5389,ARGUMENT,"the outcome of the deliberations, they formed a circle about the house:"
5390,ARGUMENT,they soon filled the room and thronged the vestibule; others listened with
5391,ARGUMENT,their heads crowded into the windows.

5409,ARGUMENT,
5410,ARGUMENT,
5411,ARGUMENT,IT came the turn of the deputy Bartek to state his case. He was a man who
5412,ARGUMENT,often travelled with rafts to Königsberg; he was called the Prussian by
5413,ARGUMENT,"the members of his family, in jest, for he hated the Prussians horribly,"
5414,ARGUMENT,"although he loved to talk of them. He was a man well advanced in years,"
5415,ARGUMENT,who on his distant travels had learned much of the world; a diligent
5416,ARGUMENT,"reader of gazettes, well versed in politics, he could cast no little light"
5417,ARGUMENT,on the subject under discussion. Thus he concluded his speech:--
5418,ARGUMENT,
5419,ARGUMENT,"""This is not, Pan Maciej, my brother, and revered father of us all--this is"
5420,ARGUMENT,not aid to be despised. I should rely on the French in time of war as on
5421,ARGUMENT,"four aces; they are a warlike people, and since the times of Thaddeus"
5422,ARGUMENT,Kosciuszko the world has not had such a military genius as the great
5423,ARGUMENT,Emperor Bonaparte. I remember when the French crossed the Warta; I was on
5424,ARGUMENT,"a trip abroad at the time, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight"
5425,ARGUMENT,"hundred and six; I was just then doing some trading with Dantzic, and,"
5426,ARGUMENT,"since I have many kinsmen in the district of Posen, I had gone to visit"
5427,ARGUMENT,them. So it happened that Pan Joseph Grabowski125 and I--he is now colonel
5428,ARGUMENT,"of a regiment, but at that time he was living in the country near"
5429,ARGUMENT,Obiezierz--were out hunting small game together.
5430,ARGUMENT,
5431,ARGUMENT,"""In Great Poland126 there was then peace, as there is now in Lithuania;"
5432,ARGUMENT,suddenly the tidings spread abroad of a fearful battle; a messenger from
5433,ARGUMENT,Pan Todwen rushed up to us. Grabowski read the letter and cried: 'Jena!
5434,ARGUMENT,Jena!127 The Prussians are smitten hip and thigh; victory!' Dismounting
5435,ARGUMENT,"from my horse, I immediately fell on my knees to thank the Lord God. We"
5436,ARGUMENT,"rode back to the city as if on business, as if we knew nothing of the"
5437,ARGUMENT,"matter; there we saw that all the landraths, hofraths, commissioners and"
5438,ARGUMENT,all similar rubbish were bowing low to us; they all trembled and turned
5439,ARGUMENT,"pale, like those cockroaches we call Prussians, when one pours boiling"
5440,ARGUMENT,"water on them. Laughing and rubbing our hands we asked humbly for news,"
5441,ARGUMENT,"and inquired what they had heard from Jena. Thereupon terror seized them,"
5442,ARGUMENT,they were astonished that we already knew of that disaster. The Germans
5443,ARGUMENT,"cried, 'Ach Herri Gott! O Weh!' and, hanging their heads, they ran into"
5444,ARGUMENT,"their houses, and then pell-mell out of their houses again. O that was a"
5445,ARGUMENT,scramble! All the roads in Great Poland were full of fugitives; the
5446,ARGUMENT,"Germans crawled along them like ants, dragging their carts, or rather"
5447,ARGUMENT,"waggons and drays, as the people call them there; men and women, with"
5448,ARGUMENT,"pipes and coffee-pots, were dragging boxes and feather beds; they scuttled"
5449,ARGUMENT,off as best they could. But we quietly took counsel together: 'To horse!
5450,ARGUMENT,Let us harass the retreat of the Germans; now we will give it to the
5451,ARGUMENT,"landraths in the neck, cut chops from the hofraths, and catch the herr"
5452,ARGUMENT,officers by the cues.' And now General Dombrowski entered the district of
5453,ARGUMENT,Posen and brought the orders of the Emperor to stir up an insurrection! In
5454,ARGUMENT,one week our people so whipped and banished the Prussians that you
5455,ARGUMENT,couldn't have found a German to make medicine of!128 What if we could turn
5456,ARGUMENT,"the trick just as briskly and smartly now, and here in Lithuania give the"
5457,ARGUMENT,"Muscovites just such another sweating? Hey? What think you, Maciej? If"
5458,ARGUMENT,"Moscow picks a bone with Bonaparte, then he will make a war that will be"
5459,ARGUMENT,"no joke: he is the foremost hero in the world, and has armies unnumbered!"
5460,ARGUMENT,"Hey, what think you, Maciej, our Father Bunny?"""
5461,ARGUMENT,
5462,ARGUMENT,He concluded. All awaited the verdict of Maciej. Maciej did not move his
5463,ARGUMENT,"head or raise his eyes, but only struck himself several times on the side,"
5464,ARGUMENT,as though he were feeling for his sabre. (Since the partition of the
5465,ARGUMENT,"country he had worn no sabre; however, from old habit, at the mention of a"
5466,ARGUMENT,Muscovite he always clapped his hand to his left side; he was evidently
5467,ARGUMENT,groping for his switch; and hence everybody called him Hand-on-Hip.) Now
5468,ARGUMENT,"he raised his head, and they listened in deep silence. Maciej disappointed"
5469,ARGUMENT,the general expectation; he only frowned and again dropped his head on his
5470,ARGUMENT,"breast. Finally he spoke out, pronouncing every word slowly and with"
5471,ARGUMENT,"emphasis, and nodding his head in time with them:--"
5472,ARGUMENT,
5473,ARGUMENT,"""Silence! Whence comes all this news? How far off are the French? Who is"
5474,ARGUMENT,their leader? Have they already begun war with Moscow? Where and on what
5475,ARGUMENT,pretext? Which way are they going to move? and with what numbers are they
5476,ARGUMENT,"comings? Have they a large force of infantry and cavalry? Whoever knows,"
5477,ARGUMENT,"let him tell!"""
5478,ARGUMENT,
5479,ARGUMENT,"The crowd was silent, each man gazing at his neighbour."
5480,ARGUMENT,
5481,ARGUMENT,"""I should be glad,"" said the Prussian, ""to wait for the Bernardine Robak,"
5482,ARGUMENT,for all the tidings come from him. Meanwhile we should send trusty spies
5483,ARGUMENT,across the border and quietly arm all the country round; but meanwhile we
5484,ARGUMENT,"should conduct the whole matter with caution, in order not to betray our"
5485,ARGUMENT,"intentions to the Muscovites."""
5486,ARGUMENT,
5487,ARGUMENT,"""Hah! Wait, prate, debate?""  interrupted another Maciej, christened"
5488,ARGUMENT,"Sprinkler,129 from a great club that he called his _sprinkling-brush_; he"
5489,ARGUMENT,"had it with him to-day. He stood behind it, rested both hands on the knob,"
5490,ARGUMENT,"and leaned his chin on his hands, crying: ""Delay, wait, debate! Hem, hum,"
5491,ARGUMENT,"haw, and then run away! I have never been in Prussia; Königsberg sense is"
5492,ARGUMENT,"good for Prussia, but I have my plain gentleman's sense. This much I know:"
5493,ARGUMENT,"whoever wants to fight, let him seize his sprinkling-brush; whoever"
5494,ARGUMENT,"prefers to die, let him call the priest--that's all! I want to live and"
5495,ARGUMENT,fight! Of what use is the Bernardine? Are we schoolboys? What do I care
5496,ARGUMENT,"for that Robak? Now we will all be Robaks, that is, worms, and proceed to"
5497,ARGUMENT,"gnaw at the Muscovites! Hem, haw! spies! to explore! Do you know what that"
5498,ARGUMENT,"means? Why, that you are impotent old beggars! Hey, brothers! It is a"
5499,ARGUMENT,"setter's work to follow a trail, a Bernardine's to gather alms, but my"
5500,ARGUMENT,"work is--to sprinkle, sprinkle, sprinkle, and that's all!"""
5501,ARGUMENT,
5502,ARGUMENT,"Here he patted his club; after him the whole crowd of gentry yelled,"
5503,ARGUMENT,"""Sprinkle, sprinkle!"""
5504,ARGUMENT,
5505,ARGUMENT,"The side of Sprinkler was supported by Bartek, called Razor from his thin"
5506,ARGUMENT,"sabre; and likewise by Maciej, known as Bucket, from a blunderbuss that he"
5507,ARGUMENT,"carried, with a muzzle so broad that from it as from a pail a thousand"
5508,ARGUMENT,"bullets poured in a stream. Both cried, ""Long live Sprinkler and his"
5509,ARGUMENT,"brush."" The Prussian tried to speak, but he was drowned by uproar and"
5510,ARGUMENT,"laughter. ""Away, away with the Prussian cowards,"" they shouted; ""let"
5511,ARGUMENT,"cowards go and hide in Bernardine cowls!"""
5512,ARGUMENT,
5513,ARGUMENT,"Then once more old Maciej slowly raised his head, and the tumult began"
5514,ARGUMENT,somewhat to subside.
5515,ARGUMENT,
5516,ARGUMENT,"""Do not scoff at Robak,"" he said; ""I know him; he is a clever priest. That"
5517,ARGUMENT,"little worm130 has gnawed a larger nut than you; I have seen him but once,"
5518,ARGUMENT,but as soon as I set eyes on him I noticed what sort of bird he was; the
5519,ARGUMENT,"Monk turned away his eyes, fearing that I might summon him to confession."
5520,ARGUMENT,But that is not my affair--of that there would be much to say! He will not
5521,ARGUMENT,come here; it would be vain to summon the Bernardine. If all this news
5522,ARGUMENT,"came from him, then who knows what was his object, for he is the devil of"
5523,ARGUMENT,"a priest! If you know nothing more than this news, then why did you come"
5524,ARGUMENT,"here, and what do you want?"""
5525,ARGUMENT,
5526,ARGUMENT,"""War!"" they cried. ""What war?""  he asked. ""War with the Muscovites!"" they"
5527,ARGUMENT,"shouted, ""to fight! Down with the Muscovites!"""
5528,ARGUMENT,
5529,ARGUMENT,"The Prussian kept shouting and raising his voice higher and higher, until"
5530,ARGUMENT,"he finally obtained a hearing, which he owed partly to his polite bows,"
5531,ARGUMENT,and partly to his shrill and piercing tones.
5532,ARGUMENT,
5533,ARGUMENT,"""I too want to fight,"" he shouted, pounding his breast with his fist;"
5534,ARGUMENT,"""though I don't carry a sprinkling-brush, yet with a pole from a river"
5535,ARGUMENT,barge I once gave a good christening to four Prussians who tried to drown
5536,ARGUMENT,"me in the Pregel when I was drunk."""
5537,ARGUMENT,
5538,ARGUMENT,"""Good for you, Bartek,"" said Sprinkler, ""good for you; sprinkle,"
5539,ARGUMENT,"sprinkle!"""
5540,ARGUMENT,
5541,ARGUMENT,"""But in the name of the most dear Jesus, we must first know with whom the"
5542,ARGUMENT,"war is and about what; we must proclaim that to the world,"" shouted the"
5543,ARGUMENT,"Prussian, ""for what is going to make the people follow us? Where they are"
5544,ARGUMENT,"to go, and when, and how, we do not know ourselves. Brother gentlemen, we"
5545,ARGUMENT,"need discretion! My friends, we need order and method! If you wish war,"
5546,ARGUMENT,"let us make a confederacy,131 and discuss where to form it and under whose"
5547,ARGUMENT,leadership. That was the way in Great Poland--we saw the retreat of the
5548,ARGUMENT,"Germans, and what did we do? We consulted secretly together; we armed both"
5549,ARGUMENT,"the gentry and a company of peasants; and, when we were ready, we waited"
5550,ARGUMENT,"Dombrowski's orders; at last, to horse! We rose as one man!"""
5551,ARGUMENT,
5552,ARGUMENT,"""I beg the floor,"" called out the manager of Kleck, a spruce young man,"
5553,ARGUMENT,"dressed in German costume. His name was Buchmann, but he was a Pole, born"
5554,ARGUMENT,"in Poland; it was not quite certain that he was of gentle birth, but of"
5555,ARGUMENT,"that they asked no questions, and everybody respected Buchmann, because he"
5556,ARGUMENT,"was in service with a great magnate, was a good patriot, and full of"
5557,ARGUMENT,"learning. From foreign books he had learned the art of farming, and"
5558,ARGUMENT,conducted well the administration of his estate; on politics he had also
5559,ARGUMENT,formed wise opinions; he knew how to write beautifully and how to express
5560,ARGUMENT,himself with elegance: therefore all became silent when he began to
5561,ARGUMENT,discourse.
5562,ARGUMENT,
5563,ARGUMENT,"""I beg the floor,"" he repeated; he twice cleared his throat, bowed, and"
5564,ARGUMENT,with tuneful lips thus proceeded:--
5565,ARGUMENT,
5566,ARGUMENT,"""My predecessors in their eloquent speeches have touched on all the"
5567,ARGUMENT,"principal and decisive points, and have raised the discussion to a higher"
5568,ARGUMENT,plane; it only remains for me to unite into one focus the pertinent
5569,ARGUMENT,thoughts and considerations that have been put forward: I have the hope of
5570,ARGUMENT,thus reconciling contrary opinions. I have noted that the entire
5571,ARGUMENT,"discussion consists of two parts; the division is already made, and that"
5572,ARGUMENT,division I follow. First: why should we undertake an insurrection? in what
5573,ARGUMENT,spirit? That is the first vital question. The second concerns the
5574,ARGUMENT,"revolutionary authority. The division is a proper one, only I wish to"
5575,ARGUMENT,"reverse it, and begin with the authority: when once we understand the"
5576,ARGUMENT,"authority, from it I will deduce the nature, spirit, and aim of the"
5577,ARGUMENT,insurrection. As for the authority then--when I survey with my eyes the
5578,ARGUMENT,"history of all humanity, what do I perceive therein? Why, that the human"
5579,ARGUMENT,"race, savage, and scattered in forests, gathers together, collects, unites"
5580,ARGUMENT,"for common defence, and considers it; that is its first consultation. Then"
5581,ARGUMENT,each lays aside a part of his own liberty for the common good; that is the
5582,ARGUMENT,"first foundation, from which, as from a spring, flow all laws. We see then"
5583,ARGUMENT,"that government is created by agreement, and does not proceed, as men"
5584,ARGUMENT,"erroneously hold, from the will of God. Thus, since government rests upon"
5585,ARGUMENT,"the social contract, the division of power is only its necessary"
5586,ARGUMENT,"consequence."""
5587,ARGUMENT,
5588,ARGUMENT,"""So there you are at contracts! Do you mean those of Kiev or of Minsk?""132"
5589,ARGUMENT,"said old Maciej. ""You must mean the Babin government!133 Pan Buchmann,"
5590,ARGUMENT,whether God or the devil chose to cast the Tsar upon us I will not dispute
5591,ARGUMENT,"with Your Honour; Pan Buchmann, tell us, please, how to cast off the"
5592,ARGUMENT,"Tsar."""
5593,ARGUMENT,
5594,ARGUMENT,"""There's the rub,"" shouted Sprinkler; ""if I could only jump to the throne,"
5595,ARGUMENT,"and with my brush--splash--once moisten the Tsar, then he wouldn't come"
5596,ARGUMENT,"back, either through the Kiev tract or the Minsk tract, or by any one of"
5597,ARGUMENT,Buchmann's contracts; the Russian priests would not revive him either by
5598,ARGUMENT,the power of God or by that of Beelzebub--the only brave way is to
5599,ARGUMENT,"sprinkle. Pan Buchmann, your speech was very eloquent, but eloquence is"
5600,ARGUMENT,"nothing but noise; sprinkling is the principal thing."""
5601,ARGUMENT,
5602,ARGUMENT,"""Good, good, good!"" squealed Bartek the Razor, rubbing his hands, and"
5603,ARGUMENT,running from Sprinkler to Maciek like a shuttle thrown from one side of
5604,ARGUMENT,"the loom to the other. ""Only do you, Maciek of the switch, and you, Maciek"
5605,ARGUMENT,"of the club, make up your disagreement, and, so help me Heaven, we will"
5606,ARGUMENT,knock the Muscovites to splinters; Razor advances under the orders of
5607,ARGUMENT,"Switch."""
5608,ARGUMENT,
5609,ARGUMENT,"""Orders are good on parade,"" interrupted Sprinkler. ""We had a standing"
5610,ARGUMENT,"order in the Kowno brigade, a short and pointed one: 'Strike terror and be"
5611,ARGUMENT,"not terrified; fight and do not surrender; advance always, and make quick"
5612,ARGUMENT,"strokes, slish, slash!' """
5613,ARGUMENT,
5614,ARGUMENT,"""Those are my principles,"" squealed Razor. ""What's the use of spilling ink"
5615,ARGUMENT,and drawing up acts of confederation? Do you want one? That's the whole
5616,ARGUMENT,question. Maciej is our marshal and his little switch is his baton of
5617,ARGUMENT,"office."""
5618,ARGUMENT,
5619,ARGUMENT,"""Long live Cock-on-the-Steeple!"" shouted Baptist. The gentry answered,"
5620,ARGUMENT,"""Vivant the sprinklers!"""
5621,ARGUMENT,
5622,ARGUMENT,"But in the corners a murmur had arisen, though it was stifled in the"
5623,ARGUMENT,centre; evidently the council was dividing into two sides. Buchmann
5624,ARGUMENT,"shouted: ""I will never approve an agreement; that's my system."" Somebody"
5625,ARGUMENT,"else yelled ""Veto,""134 and others seconded him from the corners. Finally"
5626,ARGUMENT,"the gruff voice of Skoluba was heard, a gentleman from another hamlet."
5627,ARGUMENT,
5628,ARGUMENT,"""What is this, my friends of the Dobrzynski family? What does all this"
5629,ARGUMENT,"mean? How about us, shall we be deprived of our rights? When we were"
5630,ARGUMENT,"invited from our hamlet--and the Warden, My-boy Rembajlo invited us--we were"
5631,ARGUMENT,"told that great things were to be done, that the question did not affect"
5632,ARGUMENT,"the Dobrzynskis alone, but the whole district, the entire gentry; Robak"
5633,ARGUMENT,"mumbled the same thing, though he never finished his talk and always"
5634,ARGUMENT,"stammered and expressed himself obscurely. Well, finally we have gathered,"
5635,ARGUMENT,and have called in our neighbours by messengers. You Dobrzynskis are not
5636,ARGUMENT,the only men here; from various other hamlets there are about two hundred
5637,ARGUMENT,"of us here; so let us _all_ consult together. If we need a marshal, let us"
5638,ARGUMENT,"all vote, with an equal voice for each; long live equality!"""
5639,ARGUMENT,
5640,ARGUMENT,Then two Terajewiczes and four Stypulkowskis and three Mickiewiczes
5641,ARGUMENT,"shouted, ""Vivat equality,"" taking the side of Skoluba. Meanwhile Buchmann"
5642,ARGUMENT,"was crying, ""Agreement will be our ruin!"" Sprinkler yelled: ""We can get"
5643,ARGUMENT,"along alone without you; long live our marshal, the Maciek of Macieks! Let"
5644,ARGUMENT,"him have the baton!"" The Dobrzynskis cried, ""We beg you to take it!"" but"
5645,ARGUMENT,"the rest of the gentry shouted with one voice, ""We forbid it!"" The throng"
5646,ARGUMENT,"was breaking up into two groups, and, nodding their heads in contrary"
5647,ARGUMENT,"directions, one faction cried, ""We forbid,"" and the other, ""We beg you."""
5648,ARGUMENT,
5649,ARGUMENT,"Old Maciek sat in their midst the one dumb man, and his head alone was"
5650,ARGUMENT,"unmoved. Opposite him stood Baptist, resting his hands on his club, and,"
5651,ARGUMENT,"moving his head, which was supported on the end of the club, like a"
5652,ARGUMENT,"pumpkin stuck on the end of a long pole, he nodded it, now forward and now"
5653,ARGUMENT,"backward, and cried incessantly, ""Sprinkle, sprinkle!"" Up and down the"
5654,ARGUMENT,"room the mobile Razor ran constantly from Sprinkler to Maciej's bench, but"
5655,ARGUMENT,Bucket slowly walked across the room from the Dobrzynskis to the other
5656,ARGUMENT,"gentry, as if he were trying to reconcile them. One shouted continually,"
5657,ARGUMENT,"""Shave,"" and the other, ""Pour""; Maciek held his peace, but he was"
5658,ARGUMENT,evidently beginning to be angry.
5659,ARGUMENT,
5660,ARGUMENT,"For a quarter of an hour the uproar seethed, when above the bawling crowd,"
5661,ARGUMENT,"out of the throng of heads, there leapt aloft a shining pillar. This was a"
5662,ARGUMENT,"sword two yards long and a whole palm broad, sharp on both edges."
5663,ARGUMENT,"Evidently it was a German sword, forged of Nuremberg steel; all gazed at"
5664,ARGUMENT,"the weapon in silence. Who had raised it up? They could not see, but at"
5665,ARGUMENT,once they guessed.
5666,ARGUMENT,
5667,ARGUMENT,"""That is the penknife, long live the penknife!"" they shouted; ""vivat the"
5668,ARGUMENT,"penknife, the jewel135 of Rembajlo hamlet! Vivat Rembajlo, Notchy,"
5669,ARGUMENT,"Half-Goat, My-boy!"""
5670,ARGUMENT,
5671,ARGUMENT,"At once Gerwazy, for it was he, pressed through the crowd into the middle"
5672,ARGUMENT,"of the room, carrying his flashing penknife; then, lowering the point"
5673,ARGUMENT,"before Maciek as a sign of greeting, he said:--"
5674,ARGUMENT,
5675,ARGUMENT,"""The penknife bows to the switch. Brothers, gentlemen of Dobrzyn, I will"
5676,ARGUMENT,give you no advice. Not at all; I will only tell you why I have assembled
5677,ARGUMENT,"you; but what to do and how to do it, decide for yourselves. You know the"
5678,ARGUMENT,rumour has long been current among the hamlets that great things are
5679,ARGUMENT,preparing in the world. Father Robak has been talking of this; do not you
5680,ARGUMENT,"all know this?"" (""We know it,"" they shouted.) ""Well, so for a wise head,"""
5681,ARGUMENT,"continued the orator, looking sharply at them, ""two words are enough. Is"
5682,ARGUMENT,"not that true?"" (""It is,"" they said.) ""Since the French Emperor is coming"
5683,ARGUMENT,"from one direction,"" said the Warden, ""and the Russian Tsar from the"
5684,ARGUMENT,"other, there will be war; the Tsar and the Emperor, kings and kings, will"
5685,ARGUMENT,start to pummel one another as monarchs usually do--and shall we sit quiet?
5686,ARGUMENT,"When the great begin to choke the great, let us choke the smaller, each"
5687,ARGUMENT,"his own man. When we set to smiting above and below, great men great ones,"
5688,ARGUMENT,"and small men small ones, then all the rascals will be overthrown, and"
5689,ARGUMENT,thus happiness and the Polish Commonwealth will bloom again. Is not this
5690,ARGUMENT,"so?"""
5691,ARGUMENT,
5692,ARGUMENT,"""As true as if you were reading it out of a book,"" they said."
5693,ARGUMENT,
5694,ARGUMENT,"""It is true!"" repeated Baptist, ""drop after drop, every bit."""
5695,ARGUMENT,
5696,ARGUMENT,"""I am always ready to shave!"" exclaimed Razor."
5697,ARGUMENT,
5698,ARGUMENT,"""Only make an agreement,"" courteously begged Bucket, ""under whose"
5699,ARGUMENT,"leadership Baptist and Maciej shall proceed."""
5700,ARGUMENT,
5701,ARGUMENT,"But Buchmann interrupted him: ""Let fools agree; discussions do not harm"
5702,ARGUMENT,"the common weal. I beg you to be silent."" (""We are listening."") ""The case"
5703,ARGUMENT,"gains thereby; the Warden is considering it from a new point of view."""
5704,ARGUMENT,
5705,ARGUMENT,"""Not at all,"" shouted the Warden, ""I follow the old fashion. Of great"
5706,ARGUMENT,"things great men should think; for them there is an Emperor, and there"
5707,ARGUMENT,"will be a King, a Senate, and Deputies. Such things, my boy, are done in"
5708,ARGUMENT,"Cracow or in Warsaw, not here among us, in the hamlet of Dobrzyn. Acts of"
5709,ARGUMENT,"confederation are not written on a chimney with chalk, nor on a river"
5710,ARGUMENT,"barge, but on parchment; it is not for us to write such acts. Poland has"
5711,ARGUMENT,the secretaries of the Kingdom and of Lithuania; such was the ancient
5712,ARGUMENT,"custom: my business is to whittle with my penknife."""
5713,ARGUMENT,
5714,ARGUMENT,"""To sprinkle with my brush,"" added Sprinkler."
5715,ARGUMENT,
5716,ARGUMENT,"""And to bore with my awl,"" cried Bartek the Awl, drawing his sword."
5717,ARGUMENT,
5718,ARGUMENT,"""I summon you all to witness,"" concluded the Warden; ""did not Robak tell"
5719,ARGUMENT,"you, that before you receive Napoleon into your house you should sweep out"
5720,ARGUMENT,"the dirt? You all heard it, but do you understand? Who is the dirt of the"
5721,ARGUMENT,district? Who traitorously killed the best of Poles; who robbed and
5722,ARGUMENT,"plundered him? Who? Must I tell you?"""
5723,ARGUMENT,
5724,ARGUMENT,"""Why, it is Soplica,"" interrupted Bucket; ""and now he even wants to snatch"
5725,ARGUMENT,"the remnants from the hands of the heir; he is a scoundrel."""
5726,ARGUMENT,
5727,ARGUMENT,"""O, he is a tyrant!"" squealed Razor."
5728,ARGUMENT,
5729,ARGUMENT,"""Then sprinkle him!"" added Baptist."
5730,ARGUMENT,
5731,ARGUMENT,"""If he is a traitor,"" said Buchmann, ""to the gallows with him!"""
5732,ARGUMENT,
5733,ARGUMENT,"""Hurrah!"" they all cried, ""down with Soplica!"""
5734,ARGUMENT,
5735,ARGUMENT,"But the Prussian ventured to undertake the defence of the Judge, and cried"
5736,ARGUMENT,with arms held up towards the gentry:--
5737,ARGUMENT,
5738,ARGUMENT,"""Brother gentlemen! O! O! By God's wounds, what means this? Warden, are"
5739,ARGUMENT,"you mad? Was it this we were discussing? Because a man had a crazy, outlaw"
5740,ARGUMENT,"brother, shall we punish him on his brother's account? That is a Christian"
5741,ARGUMENT,way of doing things! The Count is behind all this. As for the Judge's
5742,ARGUMENT,"being hard on the gentry, that is not true! In Heaven's name! Why, it is"
5743,ARGUMENT,"you who summon _him_ to court, but he always seeks a peaceful settlement"
5744,ARGUMENT,with you; he yields his rights and even pays the costs. He has a lawsuit
5745,ARGUMENT,"with the Count, but what of that? Both are rich; let magnate fight"
5746,ARGUMENT,magnate: what do we people care? The Judge a tyrant! He was the first to
5747,ARGUMENT,"forbid that the peasants should bow low before him, saying that that was a"
5748,ARGUMENT,sin. Often a company of peasants--I have seen this myself--sit at table with
5749,ARGUMENT,"him; he has paid the taxes for the village, and it is quite different at"
5750,ARGUMENT,"Kleck, though there, Pan Buchmann, you run things in German fashion. The"
5751,ARGUMENT,Judge a traitor! I have known him since we were in the primary school; as
5752,ARGUMENT,"a lad he was honest, and to-day he is the same; he loves Poland above"
5753,ARGUMENT,"everything, he keeps up Polish customs, he will not yield to Muscovite"
5754,ARGUMENT,"fashions. Whenever I return from Prussia, and want to wash off the German"
5755,ARGUMENT,"taint, I drop in at Soplicowo, as the centre of Polish ways; there a man"
5756,ARGUMENT,"drinks and breathes his Country! In God's name, brothers Dobrzynski; I am"
5757,ARGUMENT,"one of you, but I will not let the Judge be wronged; nothing will come of"
5758,ARGUMENT,"that. It was not thus in Great Poland, brothers: what a spirit! what"
5759,ARGUMENT,harmony! It is pleasant to remember it! There no one dared to interrupt
5760,ARGUMENT,"our counsels with such a trifle."""
5761,ARGUMENT,
5762,ARGUMENT,"""It is no trifle to hang scoundrels!"" shouted the Warden."
5763,ARGUMENT,
5764,ARGUMENT,"The murmur was increasing. Suddenly Jankiel asked a hearing, jumped on a"
5765,ARGUMENT,"bench, took his stand on it, and thus raised above their heads a beard"
5766,ARGUMENT,"like a tavern bush, which hung down to his belt. With his right hand he"
5767,ARGUMENT,"slowly took from his head his foxskin hat, with his left he adjusted his"
5768,ARGUMENT,disordered skull-cap; then he tucked his right hand in his girdle and
5769,ARGUMENT,"spoke thus, bowing low to all with his foxskin hat:--"
5770,ARGUMENT,
5771,ARGUMENT,"""Well, gentlemen of Dobrzyn, I am nothing but a Jew; the Judge is no kith"
5772,ARGUMENT,or kin of mine; I respect the Soplicas as very good gentlemen and my
5773,ARGUMENT,"landlords; I respect also the Bartek and Maciej Dobrzynskis, as good"
5774,ARGUMENT,neighbours and my benefactors; but I say thus: if you want to do violence
5775,ARGUMENT,"to the Judge, that is very bad; some of you may get hurt and be killed."
5776,ARGUMENT,But how about the assessors? and the police-captain? and the prison? For
5777,ARGUMENT,"in the village near Soplica's house there are heaps of soldiers, all"
5778,ARGUMENT,"yagers! The Assessor is at the house; he need only whistle, and they will"
5779,ARGUMENT,march right up and stand there ready for action. And what will happen
5780,ARGUMENT,"then? But if you are expecting the French, why the French are still far"
5781,ARGUMENT,"off, a long road. I'm a Jew and know nothing of war, but I have been in"
5782,ARGUMENT,"Bielica, where I met Jews straight from the boundary. The report is that"
5783,ARGUMENT,"the French were stationed on the river Lososna, and that if there is to be"
5784,ARGUMENT,"war, it will not come till spring. Well, I tell you, wait; the farm of"
5785,ARGUMENT,"Soplicowo is not a fair booth, that is taken apart, put in a waggon, and"
5786,ARGUMENT,carried off; the farm will stand as it is until spring. And the Judge is
5787,ARGUMENT,"no Jew in a rented tavern; he won't run away, you can find him in the"
5788,ARGUMENT,"spring. But now pray disperse, and don't speak aloud of what has occurred,"
5789,ARGUMENT,"for to talk of it will do no good. And I beg you all, kind gentlemen,"
5790,ARGUMENT,"follow me: my Sarah has given birth to a little Jankiel, and to-day I"
5791,ARGUMENT,"treat the crowd; and the music is splendid! I will order bagpipes, a bass"
5792,ARGUMENT,"viol, and two fiddles; and Pan Maciek, my friend, likes old July mead and"
5793,ARGUMENT,"a new mazurka. I have new mazurkas, and I have taught my kids to sing just"
5794,ARGUMENT,"fine."""
5795,ARGUMENT,
5796,ARGUMENT,The eloquence of the universally beloved Jankiel touched the hearts of his
5797,ARGUMENT,hearers; there arose cries and exclamations of joy; the murmur of
5798,ARGUMENT,"approbation was even spreading beyond the house, when Gerwazy aimed his"
5799,ARGUMENT,penknife at Jankiel. The Jew jumped down and disappeared in the crowd; the
5800,ARGUMENT,Warden shouted:--
5801,ARGUMENT,
5802,ARGUMENT,"""Begone, Jew, don't stick your fingers into the door; this is not your"
5803,ARGUMENT,"business! Prussian, because you, sir, conduct your trading with the"
5804,ARGUMENT,"Judge's pair of miserable boats, are you shouting for him? Have you"
5805,ARGUMENT,"forgotten, my boy, that your respected father used to make the trip to"
5806,ARGUMENT,Prussia with twenty Horeszko boats? Thence he and his family grew rich;
5807,ARGUMENT,"yes, and every one of you that are living here in Dobrzyn. For you old men"
5808,ARGUMENT,"remember, and you young men have heard, that the Pantler was the father"
5809,ARGUMENT,and benefactor of you all. Whom did he send as manager to his Pinsk
5810,ARGUMENT,estates? A Dobrzynski. Who were his accountants? Dobrzynskis. He chose
5811,ARGUMENT,none for majordomos and none for butlers except Dobrzynskis; his house was
5812,ARGUMENT,"full of Dobrzynskis. He pressed your cases before the courts, he gained"
5813,ARGUMENT,pensions for you from the king; he put your children by droves in the
5814,ARGUMENT,"Piarist136 schools, and paid for their clothes, board, and lodging; when"
5815,ARGUMENT,"they grew up he even got places for them, also at his own expense. Why did"
5816,ARGUMENT,he do this? Because he was your neighbour. To-day Soplica's landmarks
5817,ARGUMENT,"touch your borders; what good has _he_ ever done you?"""
5818,ARGUMENT,
5819,ARGUMENT,"""Not a bit!"" interrupted Bucket, ""for he is an upstart that rose from"
5820,ARGUMENT,"being a petty landholder. But how haughtily he blows out his cheeks, pooh,"
5821,ARGUMENT,"pooh, pooh; how high he holds his head! You remember, I invited him to my"
5822,ARGUMENT,"daughter's wedding; I offered him drink, but he wouldn't take it; he said:"
5823,ARGUMENT,'I don't drink as much as you gentry; you gentry swill like bitterns.'
5824,ARGUMENT,"What a magnate! a milksop made of pastry flour!137 He wouldn't drink, so"
5825,ARGUMENT,"we poured it down his throat; he cried, 'This is an act of violence!' Just"
5826,ARGUMENT,"wait; I'll pour it into him out of my bucket!"""
5827,ARGUMENT,
5828,ARGUMENT,"""The knave!"" exclaimed Baptist; ""I'll just sprinkle him on my own account."
5829,ARGUMENT,My son used to be a clever lad; now he's turned so stupid that they call
5830,ARGUMENT,"him Buzzard,138 and he has become such a ninny all because of the Judge. I"
5831,ARGUMENT,"said to him once, 'What do you run off to Soplicowo for? If I catch you"
5832,ARGUMENT,"there, God help you!' Immediately he slunk off to Zosia again, and stole"
5833,ARGUMENT,"through the hemp; I caught him, and then took him by the ears and"
5834,ARGUMENT,sprinkled him. But he blubbered and blubbered like a peasant's baby:
5835,ARGUMENT,"'Father, you may kill me, but I must go there!' and he kept on sobbing."
5836,ARGUMENT,"'What's the matter with you?' I asked, and he told me that he was in love"
5837,ARGUMENT,"with Zosia, and wanted to have a look at her! I felt sorry for the poor"
5838,ARGUMENT,"lad, and said to the Judge: 'Judge, give me Zosia for Buzzard.' 'She is"
5839,ARGUMENT,"still too young,' he answered. 'Wait about three years, and then she may"
5840,ARGUMENT,do as she likes.' The scoundrel! He lies; he's already arranging another
5841,ARGUMENT,match for her. I have heard of it; just let me screw myself in there at
5842,ARGUMENT,"the wedding, and I'll bless their marriage bed with my sprinkler."""
5843,ARGUMENT,
5844,ARGUMENT,"""And shall such a scoundrel hold sway,"" cried the Warden, ""and ruin"
5845,ARGUMENT,"ancient magnates, better men than he? And shall both the memory and the"
5846,ARGUMENT,name of the Horeszkos perish! Where is there gratitude in the world? There
5847,ARGUMENT,"is none in Dobrzyn. Brothers, do you wish to wage war with the Russian"
5848,ARGUMENT,Emperor and yet do you fear a battle with Soplicowo farm? Are you afraid
5849,ARGUMENT,of prison! Do I summon you to brigandage? God forbid! Gentlemen and
5850,ARGUMENT,"brothers, I stand on my rights. Why, the Count has won several times and"
5851,ARGUMENT,has obtained no few decrees; the only trouble is to execute them! This was
5852,ARGUMENT,"the ancient custom: the court wrote the decree, and the gentry carried it"
5853,ARGUMENT,"out, and especially the Dobrzynskis, and thence grew your fame in"
5854,ARGUMENT,"Lithuania! Yes, at the foray of Mysz the Dobrzynskis alone fought with the"
5855,ARGUMENT,"Muscovites, who were led by the Russian general Voynilovich, and that"
5856,ARGUMENT,"scoundrel, his friend, Pan Wolk of Logomowicze. You remember how we took"
5857,ARGUMENT,"Wolk captive, and how we were going to hang him to a beam in the barn,"
5858,ARGUMENT,because he was a tyrant to the peasantry and a servant of the Muscovites;
5859,ARGUMENT,but the stupid peasants took pity on him! (I must roast him some time on
5860,ARGUMENT,"this penknife.) I will not mention countless other great forays, from"
5861,ARGUMENT,"which we always emerged as befitted gentlemen, both with profit and with"
5862,ARGUMENT,general applause and glory! Why should I remind you of this! To-day the
5863,ARGUMENT,"Count, your neighbour, carries on his lawsuit and gains decrees in vain,"
5864,ARGUMENT,for not one of you is willing to aid the poor orphan! The heir of that
5865,ARGUMENT,"Pantler who nourished hundreds, to-day has no friend except me, his"
5866,ARGUMENT,"Warden, and except this faithful penknife of mine!"""
5867,ARGUMENT,
5868,ARGUMENT,"""And my brush,"" said Sprinkler. ""Where you go, dear Gerwazy, there will I"
5869,ARGUMENT,"go too, while I have a hand, and while this splish-splash is in my hands."
5870,ARGUMENT,"Two are a pair! In Heaven's name, my Gerwazy! You have your sword, I have"
5871,ARGUMENT,"my sprinkling-brush! In Heaven's name, I will sprinkle, and do you strike;"
5872,ARGUMENT,"and thus slish and slash, splish and splash; let others prate!"""
5873,ARGUMENT,
5874,ARGUMENT,"""But, my brothers,"" said Razor, ""you will not exclude Bartek; all that you"
5875,ARGUMENT,"may soap I will shave."""
5876,ARGUMENT,
5877,ARGUMENT,"""I too prefer to move on with you,"" added Bucket, ""since I cannot make"
5878,ARGUMENT,them agree on the choice of a marshal. What care I for votes and balls for
5879,ARGUMENT,"voting? I have other balls."" (Here he took from his pocket a handful of"
5880,ARGUMENT,"bullets and rattled them.) ""Here are balls!"" he cried, ""all these balls"
5881,ARGUMENT,"are for the Judge!"""
5882,ARGUMENT,
5883,ARGUMENT,"""We will join you,"" shouted Skoluba, ""indeed we will!"""
5884,ARGUMENT,
5885,ARGUMENT,"""Where you go,"" cried all the gentry, ""where you go, there will we go"
5886,ARGUMENT,also! Long live the Horeszkos! Vivant the Half-Goats! Vivat the Warden
5887,ARGUMENT,"Rembajlo! Down with the Soplica!"""
5888,ARGUMENT,
5889,ARGUMENT,"And thus the eloquent Gerwazy carried them all away, for all had their"
5890,ARGUMENT,"grudges against the Judge, as is usual among neighbours; now complaints of"
5891,ARGUMENT,"damage done by cattle, now for the cutting of wood, now squabbles over"
5892,ARGUMENT,"boundary lines: some were aroused by anger, others merely by envy for the"
5893,ARGUMENT,wealth of the Judge--all were united by hatred. They crowded about the
5894,ARGUMENT,"Warden, and raised aloft sabres and sticks."
5895,ARGUMENT,
5896,ARGUMENT,"At last Maciek, hitherto sullen and motionless, rose from his bench and"
5897,ARGUMENT,with slow steps came out into the middle of the room and put his hands on
5898,ARGUMENT,"his hips: looking straight before him and nodding his head, he began to"
5899,ARGUMENT,"speak, pronouncing slowly every word, pausing between them and emphasising"
5900,ARGUMENT,them:--
5901,ARGUMENT,
5902,ARGUMENT,"""O stupid, stupid idiots! Whoever dances, you will pay the piper. So long"
5903,ARGUMENT,as the discussion was over the resurrection of Poland and had to do with
5904,ARGUMENT,"the public weal, idiots, all this time you quarrelled! It was impossible,"
5905,ARGUMENT,"idiots, either to debate, idiots, or to get order among you, or to put a"
5906,ARGUMENT,"leader over you, idiots! But let any one raise his private grudges,"
5907,ARGUMENT,"idiots, then straightway you agree! Get out of here! for, as my name is"
5908,ARGUMENT,"Maciek, I wish you to millions, hundreds of hundreds of thousands of"
5909,ARGUMENT,"waggons of hogsheads, of drays of devils!!!"""
5910,ARGUMENT,
5911,ARGUMENT,All were hushed as if struck by lightning! But at the same moment a
5912,ARGUMENT,"terrible shouting arose outside the house, ""Vivat the Count!"" He was"
5913,ARGUMENT,"riding into Maciej's yard, armed himself, and followed by ten armed"
5914,ARGUMENT,jockeys. The Count was mounted on a mettled steed and dressed in black
5915,ARGUMENT,"garments; over them a nut-brown cloak of Italian cut, broad and without"
5916,ARGUMENT,"sleeves, and fastened at the neck with a buckle, fell from his shoulders"
5917,ARGUMENT,"like a great shroud. He wore a round hat with a feather, and carried a"
5918,ARGUMENT,sword in his hand; he wheeled about and saluted the throng with the sword.
5919,ARGUMENT,
5920,ARGUMENT,"""Vivat the Count!"" they cried; ""we will live and die with him!"" The gentry"
5921,ARGUMENT,"began to gaze out of the cottage through the windows, and to press"
5922,ARGUMENT,"continually towards the door behind the Warden. The Warden went out, and"
5923,ARGUMENT,behind him the crowd tumbled through the door; Maciek drove out the
5924,ARGUMENT,"remnant, shut the door, bolted it, and, looking out through the window,"
5925,ARGUMENT,"said once more, ""Idiots!"""
5926,ARGUMENT,
5927,ARGUMENT,But meanwhile the gentry had rallied to the Count. They went to the
5928,ARGUMENT,"tavern; Gerwazy called to mind the days of old, and bade them give him"
5929,ARGUMENT,"three Polish girdles, by means of which he drew from the vaults of the"
5930,ARGUMENT,"tavern three casks, one of mead, the second of brandy, and the third of"
5931,ARGUMENT,"beer. He took out the spigots, and immediately three streamlets spurted"
5932,ARGUMENT,"forth, gurgling, one white as silver, the second red as carnelian, the"
5933,ARGUMENT,third yellow: with a triple rainbow they played on high; they fell in a
5934,ARGUMENT,hundred cups and hummed in a hundred glasses. The gentry ran riot: some
5935,ARGUMENT,"drank, others wished a hundred years to the Count, all shouted, ""Down with"
5936,ARGUMENT,"the Soplica!"""
5937,ARGUMENT,
5938,ARGUMENT,"Jankiel rode off on horseback, silently, without saddle; the Prussian"
5939,ARGUMENT,"likewise, unheard, though he still discoursed eloquently, tried to slip"
5940,ARGUMENT,"away; the gentry chased him, crying that he was a traitor. Mickiewicz"
5941,ARGUMENT,"stood apart, at some distance, without either shouting or giving counsel,"
5942,ARGUMENT,but from his air they perceived that he was plotting something evil: so
5943,ARGUMENT,"they drew their blades, and at the shout of ""Down with him"" he retreated,"
5944,ARGUMENT,"and defended himself; he was already wounded and leaning on the fence,"
5945,ARGUMENT,when Zan and the three Czechots sprang to his aid. After this the men were
5946,ARGUMENT,"separated, but in that scuffle two had been wounded in the hand, and one"
5947,ARGUMENT,had got cut over the ear. The rest were mounting their horses.
5948,ARGUMENT,
5949,ARGUMENT,The Count and Gerwazy marshalled them and distributed arms and orders. At
5950,ARGUMENT,"last, all started at a gallop down the long street of the hamlet, crying,"
5951,ARGUMENT,"""Down with the Soplica!"""

5970,ARGUMENT,"BEFORE a thunderstorm there is a quiet, sullen moment, when the cloud that"
5971,ARGUMENT,has gathered over men's heads stops and with threatening countenance
5972,ARGUMENT,"checks the breath of the winds; it is silent, but surveys the earth with"
5973,ARGUMENT,"the eyes of the lightnings, marking the spots where soon it will cast bolt"
5974,ARGUMENT,after bolt: such a moment of calm rested over the house at Soplicowo. You
5975,ARGUMENT,would have thought that a presentiment of unusual events had closed all
5976,ARGUMENT,"lips, and had borne off the spirits of all into the land of dreams."
5977,ARGUMENT,
5978,ARGUMENT,After supper the Judge and his guests went out into the yard to enjoy the
5979,ARGUMENT,"evening, and seated themselves on benches of turf built along the house"
5980,ARGUMENT,"wall. The whole company, in gloomy, quiet attitudes, gazed at the sky,"
5981,ARGUMENT,"which seemed to grow lower and narrower, and to approach the earth nearer"
5982,ARGUMENT,"and nearer, until both, hiding beneath a dark veil, like lovers, began a"
5983,ARGUMENT,"mysterious discourse, interpreting their feelings in the stifled sighs,"
5984,ARGUMENT,"whispers, murmurs, and half-uttered words, of which the marvellous music"
5985,ARGUMENT,of the evening is composed.
5986,ARGUMENT,
5987,ARGUMENT,"The owl began it, hooting from beneath the house roof; the bats rustled"
5988,ARGUMENT,"with flimsy wings, and flew towards the house, where shone the panes of"
5989,ARGUMENT,"the windows and human faces; but nearer, the little sisters of the bats,"
5990,ARGUMENT,"the moths, hovered in a swarm, attracted by the white garments of the"
5991,ARGUMENT,"women; they were especially troublesome to Zosia, beating against her face"
5992,ARGUMENT,"and her bright eyes, which they mistook for two candles. In the air an"
5993,ARGUMENT,"immense cloud of insects gathered and whirled about, playing like the"
5994,ARGUMENT,music of the spheres; Zosia's ear distinguished amid the thousand noises
5995,ARGUMENT,the accord of the flies and the false half-tone of the mosquitoes.
5996,ARGUMENT,
5997,ARGUMENT,In the fields the evening concert had hardly begun; the musicians were
5998,ARGUMENT,"just finishing the tuning of their instruments: already the land rail, the"
5999,ARGUMENT,"first violin of the meadow, had shrieked thrice; already from afar the"
6000,ARGUMENT,bitterns seconded it with a bass boom below in the marshes; already the
6001,ARGUMENT,"woodcocks were rising up with whirling flight, uttering repeated cries, as"
6002,ARGUMENT,though they were beating on drums.
6003,ARGUMENT,
6004,ARGUMENT,As a finale to the humming of the insects and the din of the birds there
6005,ARGUMENT,"resounded in a double chorus two ponds, like enchanted lakes in the"
6006,ARGUMENT,"Caucasus mountains, silent through all the day and playing at evening. One"
6007,ARGUMENT,"pond, which had clear depths and a sandy shore, gave forth from its blue"
6008,ARGUMENT,"chest a gentle, solemn call; the other pond, with a muddy bottom and a"
6009,ARGUMENT,"turbid throat, answered it with a mournfully passionate cry. In both ponds"
6010,ARGUMENT,sang countless hordes of frogs; the two choruses were attuned into two
6011,ARGUMENT,"great accords: one thundered fortissimo, the other gently warbled; one"
6012,ARGUMENT,"seemed to complain, the other only sighed; thus the two ponds conversed"
6013,ARGUMENT,"together across the fields, like two Æolian harps that play alternately."
6014,ARGUMENT,
6015,ARGUMENT,The darkness was thickening; only in the woods and among the willows along
6016,ARGUMENT,"the streamlet the eyes of wolves shone like candles, and farther off, on"
6017,ARGUMENT,"the narrowed borders of the horizon, here and there were the fires of"
6018,ARGUMENT,"shepherds' camps. Finally the moon lighted her silver torch, came forth"
6019,ARGUMENT,"from the wood, and illumined both sky and land. Now they both, half"
6020,ARGUMENT,"uncovered from the darkness, slept side by side, like a happy married"
6021,ARGUMENT,"pair; the heaven took into its pure arms the breast of the earth, which"
6022,ARGUMENT,shone silvery in the moonlight.
6023,ARGUMENT,
6024,ARGUMENT,"Now, opposite the moon, first one star and then another began to shine;"
6025,ARGUMENT,"now a thousand of them, and now a million twinkled. Castor and his brother"
6026,ARGUMENT,"Pollux glittered at their head, once called among the Slavs Lele and"
6027,ARGUMENT,Polele;139 now they have been christened anew in the people's zodiac; one
6028,ARGUMENT,is called Lithuania and the other the Kingdom.140
6029,ARGUMENT,
6030,ARGUMENT,Farther off glitter the two pans of the heavenly Scales. Upon them God on
6031,ARGUMENT,the day of creation--as old men say--weighed in turn the earth and all the
6032,ARGUMENT,planets before he set the burden of them in the abysses of the air; then
6033,ARGUMENT,he hung up in heaven the gilded scales: on these men have modelled their
6034,ARGUMENT,balances and scale pans.
6035,ARGUMENT,
6036,ARGUMENT,"To the north shines the circle of the starry Sieve,141 through which God,"
6037,ARGUMENT,"as they say, gifted grains of corn, when he cast them down from heaven for"
6038,ARGUMENT,"Adam our father, who had been banished for his sins from paradise."
6039,ARGUMENT,
6040,ARGUMENT,"Somewhat higher, David's Car,142 ready for mounting, turns its long pole"
6041,ARGUMENT,"towards the north star. The old Lithuanians know, concerning this chariot,"
6042,ARGUMENT,"that the populace err in calling it David's, since it is the Angel's Car."
6043,ARGUMENT,"On it long ago rode Lucifer, when he summoned God to combat, rushing at"
6044,ARGUMENT,"full gallop along the Milky Way towards the threshold of heaven, until"
6045,ARGUMENT,"Michael threw him from his car, and cast the car from the road. Now it is"
6046,ARGUMENT,stretched out ruined amid the stars; the Archangel Michael will not allow
6047,ARGUMENT,it to be repaired.
6048,ARGUMENT,
6049,ARGUMENT,And it is also well known among the old Lithuanians--but this knowledge
6050,ARGUMENT,"they probably derived from the rabbins--that the huge, long Dragon of the"
6051,ARGUMENT,"zodiac, which winds its starry coils over the sky, and which astronomers"
6052,ARGUMENT,"erroneously christen a serpent, is not a serpent, but a fish, and is named"
6053,ARGUMENT,"Leviathan. Long ago it dwelt in the seas, but after the deluge it died for"
6054,ARGUMENT,"lack of water; hence on the vault of heaven, both as a curiosity and as a"
6055,ARGUMENT,"reminder, the angels hung up its dead remains. In the same way the priest"
6056,ARGUMENT,of Mir has hung up in his church the ribs and shanks of giants that have
6057,ARGUMENT,been dug from the earth.143
6058,ARGUMENT,
6059,ARGUMENT,"Such stories of the stars, which he had conned from books or learned from"
6060,ARGUMENT,"tradition, did the Seneschal relate. Though in the evening the old"
6061,ARGUMENT,"Seneschal's sight was weak, and he could see nothing in the sky through"
6062,ARGUMENT,"his spectacles, yet he knew by heart the name and form of every"
6063,ARGUMENT,constellation; with his finger he indicated their places and their paths.
6064,ARGUMENT,
6065,ARGUMENT,"To-day they listened little to him, and gave no heed at all to the Sieve,"
6066,ARGUMENT,"or to the Dragon, or even to the Scales; to-day the eyes and thoughts of"
6067,ARGUMENT,"all were absorbed by a new guest, recently observed in the sky. This was a"
6068,ARGUMENT,"_comet_ of the first magnitude and power,144 which had appeared in the"
6069,ARGUMENT,west and was flying towards the north; with a bloody eye it looked askance
6070,ARGUMENT,"upon the Chariot, as though it wished to seize the empty place of Lucifer;"
6071,ARGUMENT,"behind, it threw out a long tail, and with it encircled a third part of"
6072,ARGUMENT,"the sky, gathered in hundreds of stars as with a net, and drew them after"
6073,ARGUMENT,"it; but it aimed its own head higher, towards the north, straight for the"
6074,ARGUMENT,polar star.
6075,ARGUMENT,
6076,ARGUMENT,With inexpressible apprehension all the Lithuanian folk gazed each night
6077,ARGUMENT,"at this heavenly marvel, foreboding ill from it, and likewise from other"
6078,ARGUMENT,"signs: for too often they heard the cries of ill-omened birds, which,"
6079,ARGUMENT,"gathering in throngs on empty fields, sharpened their beaks as if awaiting"
6080,ARGUMENT,"corpses. Too often they noticed that the dogs rooted up the earth, and, as"
6081,ARGUMENT,"if scenting death, howled piercingly, which was an omen of famine or of"
6082,ARGUMENT,war. But the forest guards beheld how through the graveyard walked the
6083,ARGUMENT,"Maid of Pestilence, whose brow rises above the highest trees, and who"
6084,ARGUMENT,waves in her left hand a bloody kerchief.145
6085,ARGUMENT,
6086,ARGUMENT,"From all this the Overseer drew various conclusions, as he stood by the"
6087,ARGUMENT,"fence after coming to report on the work; so likewise did the Bookkeeper,"
6088,ARGUMENT,who was whispering with the Steward.
6089,ARGUMENT,
6090,ARGUMENT,But the Chamberlain was seated on the bench of turf before the house. He
6091,ARGUMENT,"interrupted the conversation of the guests, a sign that he was preparing"
6092,ARGUMENT,"to speak; in the moonlight shone his great snuffbox (all of pure gold, set"
6093,ARGUMENT,"with diamonds; in the middle of it was a portrait of King Stanislaw, under"
6094,ARGUMENT,"glass); he tapped on it with his fingers, took a pinch, and said:--"
6095,ARGUMENT,
6096,ARGUMENT,"""Thaddeus, your talk about the stars is only an echo of what you have"
6097,ARGUMENT,heard in school; as to marvels I prefer to take the advice of simple
6098,ARGUMENT,"people. I too studied astronomy for two years at Wilno, where Pani"
6099,ARGUMENT,"Puzynin, a wise and a rich woman, had given the income of a village of two"
6100,ARGUMENT,hundred peasants for the purchase of various glasses and telescopes.
6101,ARGUMENT,"Father Poczobut,146 a famous man, was in charge of the observatory, and at"
6102,ARGUMENT,that time rector of the whole university; however he finally abandoned his
6103,ARGUMENT,"professor's chair and his telescope and returned to his monastery, to his"
6104,ARGUMENT,"quiet cell, and there he died as a good Christian should. I am also"
6105,ARGUMENT,"acquainted with Sniadecki,147 who is a very wise man, though a layman. Now"
6106,ARGUMENT,the astronomers regard planets and comets just as plain citizens do a
6107,ARGUMENT,"coach; they know whether it is drawing up before the king's palace, or"
6108,ARGUMENT,whether it is starting abroad from the city gates; but who was riding in
6109,ARGUMENT,"it, and why, of what he talked with the king, and whether the king"
6110,ARGUMENT,dismissed the ambassador with peace or war--of all that they do not even
6111,ARGUMENT,inquire. I remember in my time when Branicki started in his coach to
6112,ARGUMENT,"Jassy,148 and after that dishonourable coach streamed a train of Targowica"
6113,ARGUMENT,"confederates, as the tail follows that comet. The plain people, though"
6114,ARGUMENT,"they did not meddle in public deliberations, guessed at once that that"
6115,ARGUMENT,train was an omen of treason. The report is that the folk has given the
6116,ARGUMENT,"name of broom to this comet, and says that it will sweep away a million"
6117,ARGUMENT,"men."" And in reply the Seneschal said with a bow:--"
6118,ARGUMENT,
6119,ARGUMENT,"""That is true, Your Excellency the Chamberlain. I remember myself what was"
6120,ARGUMENT,"once told me when I was a little child; I remember, though I was not ten"
6121,ARGUMENT,"years old at the time, how I saw at our house the late Sapieha, lieutenant"
6122,ARGUMENT,"of a regiment of cuirassiers, who later was Court Marshal of the Kingdom,"
6123,ARGUMENT,"and finally died as Grand Chancellor of Lithuania, at the age of one"
6124,ARGUMENT,"hundred and ten years; when Jan III. Sobieski was king, he had served in"
6125,ARGUMENT,the Vienna campaign under the command of the hetman Jablonowski. So this
6126,ARGUMENT,Chancellor related that just at the moment when King Jan III. was mounting
6127,ARGUMENT,"his horse, when the papal nuncio had blest him for the journey, and the"
6128,ARGUMENT,Austrian ambassador was kissing his foot as he handed him the stirrup (the
6129,ARGUMENT,"ambassador was named Count Wilczek), the King cried: 'See what is going on"
6130,ARGUMENT,in Heaven!' They beheld that over their heads was advancing a comet by the
6131,ARGUMENT,"same path that the armies of Mahomet had taken, from the east to the west."
6132,ARGUMENT,"Later Father Bartochowski, who composed a panegyric for the triumph at"
6133,ARGUMENT,"Cracow, under the title  _Orientis Fulmen_,149 discoursed much about that"
6134,ARGUMENT,"comet; I have also read of it in a work called _Janina_,150 in which the"
6135,ARGUMENT,"entire expedition of the late King Jan is described, and where there is"
6136,ARGUMENT,"engraved the great standard of Mahomet, and just such a comet as we see"
6137,ARGUMENT,"to-day."""
6138,ARGUMENT,
6139,ARGUMENT,"""Amen,"" said the Judge in reply, ""I accept your augury that a Jan III. may"
6140,ARGUMENT,appear along with the star! To-day there is a great hero in the west;
6141,ARGUMENT,"perhaps the comet will bring him to us: which may God grant!"""
6142,ARGUMENT,
6143,ARGUMENT,"Sorrowfully drooping his head, the Seneschal replied:--"
6144,ARGUMENT,
6145,ARGUMENT,"""A comet sometimes forebodes wars, and sometimes mere brawls! It is not"
6146,ARGUMENT,good that it has appeared here over Soplicowo; perhaps it threatens us
6147,ARGUMENT,with some household misfortune. Yesterday we had wrangling and disputes
6148,ARGUMENT,"enough, both at the time of the hunt and during the banquet. In the"
6149,ARGUMENT,"morning the Notary quarrelled with the Assessor, and Thaddeus challenged"
6150,ARGUMENT,the Count in the evening. The disagreement seems to have arisen from the
6151,ARGUMENT,"bear's hide, and if my friend the Judge had not hindered me, I should have"
6152,ARGUMENT,reconciled the two adversaries right at the table. For I should have liked
6153,ARGUMENT,"to tell a curious incident, similar to what occurred at our hunt"
6154,ARGUMENT,"yesterday, which happened to the foremost sportsmen of my time, the deputy"
6155,ARGUMENT,Rejtan and the Prince de Nassau. The occurrence was as follows:--
6156,ARGUMENT,
6157,ARGUMENT,"""Prince Czartoryski,151 the general of Podole, was travelling from"
6158,ARGUMENT,"Volhynia to his Polish estates, or, if I remember correctly, to the Diet"
6159,ARGUMENT,"at Warsaw. On his way he visited the gentry, partly for amusement, and"
6160,ARGUMENT,"partly to win popularity; so he called upon Pan Thaddeus Rejtan,152 to-day"
6161,ARGUMENT,"of holy memory, who was later our deputy from Nowogrodek, and in whose"
6162,ARGUMENT,"house I grew up from childhood. So Rejtan, on the occasion of the Prince's"
6163,ARGUMENT,"coming, had invited guests, and the gentry had gathered in large numbers."
6164,ARGUMENT,There were theatrical entertainments (the Prince was devoted to the
6165,ARGUMENT,"theatre); Kaszyc, who lives in Jatra, gave fireworks; Pan Tyzenhaus153"
6166,ARGUMENT,"sent dancers; and Oginski154 and Pan Soltan, who lives in Zdzienciol,"
6167,ARGUMENT,"furnished musicians. In a word, at home they offered entertainments"
6168,ARGUMENT,"gorgeous beyond expectation, and in the forest they arranged a mighty"
6169,ARGUMENT,hunt. It is well known to you gentlemen that almost all the Czartoryskis
6170,ARGUMENT,"within the memory of man, though they spring from the blood of the"
6171,ARGUMENT,"Jagiellos, are nevertheless not over keen on hunting, though certainly not"
6172,ARGUMENT,"from laziness, but from their foreign tastes; and the Prince General"
6173,ARGUMENT,"looked oftener into books than into kennels, and oftener into ladies'"
6174,ARGUMENT,alcoves than into the forests.
6175,ARGUMENT,
6176,ARGUMENT,"""In the Prince's suite was a German, Prince de Nassau,155 of whom they"
6177,ARGUMENT,"related that, when a guest in the Libyan country, he had once gone hunting"
6178,ARGUMENT,"with the Moorish kings, and there with a spear had overcome a tiger in"
6179,ARGUMENT,"hand to hand combat, of which feat that Prince de Nassau boasted greatly."
6180,ARGUMENT,"In our country, at that time, they were hunting wild boars; Rejtan had"
6181,ARGUMENT,"killed with his musket an immense sow, at great risk to himself, for he"
6182,ARGUMENT,shot from close by. Each of us admired and praised the sureness of the
6183,ARGUMENT,"aim; only the German, de Nassau, listened with indifference to such"
6184,ARGUMENT,"compliments, and, walking off, muttered in his beard that a sure aim"
6185,ARGUMENT,"proved only a bold eye, but that cold steel proved a bold hand; and once"
6186,ARGUMENT,"more he began to talk big about his Libya and his spear, his Moorish kings"
6187,ARGUMENT,"and his tiger. This began to be annoying to Pan Rejtan, who, being a"
6188,ARGUMENT,"quick-tempered man, smote his sword and said: 'My Lord Prince, whoever"
6189,ARGUMENT,"looks boldly, fights boldly; wild boars are equal to tigers, and sabres to"
6190,ARGUMENT,spears.' Then the German and he began somewhat too lively a discussion.
6191,ARGUMENT,"Luckily the Prince General interrupted their dispute, and reconciled them,"
6192,ARGUMENT,"speaking in French; what he said to them I know not, but that"
6193,ARGUMENT,reconciliation was only ashes over live coals: for Rejtan took the matter
6194,ARGUMENT,"to heart, bided his time, and promised to play the German a good trick."
6195,ARGUMENT,"This trick he almost atoned for with his own life, but he played it the"
6196,ARGUMENT,"next day, as I will tell you immediately."""
6197,ARGUMENT,
6198,ARGUMENT,"Here the Seneschal paused, and, raising his right hand, asked the"
6199,ARGUMENT,"Chamberlain for his snuffbox; he took several pinches, but did not"
6200,ARGUMENT,"vouchsafe to finish his tale, as though he wished to sharpen the curiosity"
6201,ARGUMENT,"of his hearers. At last he was beginning--when that tale, so curious and so"
6202,ARGUMENT,"diligently hearkened to, was again interrupted! For some one had"
6203,ARGUMENT,"unexpectedly sent a man to the Judge, with the message that he was waiting"
6204,ARGUMENT,"on business that brooked no delay. The Judge, wishing them good night,"
6205,ARGUMENT,bade farewell to the company: immediately they scattered in various
6206,ARGUMENT,"directions; some went into the house to sleep, others into the barn, to"
6207,ARGUMENT,rest on the hay; the Judge went to give audience to the traveller.
6208,ARGUMENT,
6209,ARGUMENT,"The others were already asleep. Thaddeus wandered about the hallway,"
6210,ARGUMENT,"pacing like a watchman near his uncle's door, for he had to seek his"
6211,ARGUMENT,"counsel about important affairs, on that very day, before he went to"
6212,ARGUMENT,"sleep. He did not dare to knock, for the Judge had locked the door and was"
6213,ARGUMENT,talking secretly with somebody; Thaddeus awaited the end of the interview
6214,ARGUMENT,and pricked up his ears.
6215,ARGUMENT,
6216,ARGUMENT,From within he heard a sobbing; without touching the latch he cautiously
6217,ARGUMENT,looked through the keyhole. He saw a marvellous thing! The Judge and Robak
6218,ARGUMENT,"were kneeling on the floor in each other's embrace, and were weeping hot"
6219,ARGUMENT,"tears; Robak was kissing the Judge's hands, while the Judge, weeping,"
6220,ARGUMENT,"embraced Robak around the neck; finally, after a pause of a quarter of an"
6221,ARGUMENT,"hour in their talk, Robak softly spoke these words:--156"
6222,ARGUMENT,
6223,ARGUMENT,"""Brother, God knows that till now I have never betrayed the secrets that,"
6224,ARGUMENT,"in repentance for my sins, I vowed at my confession to keep inviolate;"
6225,ARGUMENT,"that, entirely devoted to God and to my country, not serving pride, nor"
6226,ARGUMENT,"seeking earthly glory, I have lived till now and wished to die a"
6227,ARGUMENT,"Bernardine monk, concealing my name not only from the crowd, but from you"
6228,ARGUMENT,"and from my own son! However, the provincial has given me permission to"
6229,ARGUMENT,make the disclosure  _in articulo mortis_. Who knows whether I shall
6230,ARGUMENT,"return alive! Who knows what will happen in Dobrzyn! Brother, affairs are"
6231,ARGUMENT,"frightfully, frightfully confused! The French are still far away, we must"
6232,ARGUMENT,"wait till the winter is over, but the gentry may not restrain themselves."
6233,ARGUMENT,Perhaps I have been too active in stirring up the insurrection! They may
6234,ARGUMENT,"have understood me ill! The Warden has spoiled all! That crazy Count, I"
6235,ARGUMENT,"hear, has rushed away to Dobrzyn; I could not head him off, for an"
6236,ARGUMENT,"important reason: old Maciek has recognised me, and if he betrays me I"
6237,ARGUMENT,must needs bow my neck beneath the penknife. Nothing will restrain the
6238,ARGUMENT,"Warden! My life matters little, but by that disclosure I should destroy"
6239,ARGUMENT,the foundations of the plot.
6240,ARGUMENT,
6241,ARGUMENT,"""And yet! I must be there to-day, and see what is going on, though I"
6242,ARGUMENT,"perish! Without me the gentry will run wild! Farewell, my dearest brother!"
6243,ARGUMENT,"Farewell, I must hasten. If I perish, you alone will sigh for my soul; in"
6244,ARGUMENT,"case of war, the whole secret is known to you--finish what I have begun,"
6245,ARGUMENT,"and remember that you are a Soplica."""
6246,ARGUMENT,
6247,ARGUMENT,"Here the Monk wiped away his tears, buttoned his gown, drew on his cowl,"
6248,ARGUMENT,and quietly opened the shutters of the rear window; evidently he jumped
6249,ARGUMENT,"through the window into the garden. The Judge, left alone, sat down in a"
6250,ARGUMENT,chair and began to weep.
6251,ARGUMENT,
6252,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus waited a moment, before he jingled at the latch; when the door"
6253,ARGUMENT,was opened he went in quietly and bowed low.
6254,ARGUMENT,
6255,ARGUMENT,"""My dear uncle,"" he said, ""I have spent here but a few days, and the days"
6256,ARGUMENT,have passed like a flash. I have not yet had time to enjoy fully your
6257,ARGUMENT,"house and your own company, but I must depart, I must hasten away at once;"
6258,ARGUMENT,"to-day, uncle, or to-morrow at the latest. You remember that we have"
6259,ARGUMENT,"challenged the Count; to fight him is my affair, and I have sent a"
6260,ARGUMENT,"challenge. Since duelling is prohibited in Lithuania, I am going to the"
6261,ARGUMENT,"borders of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw; the Count, of course, is a braggart,"
6262,ARGUMENT,"but he does not lack courage, and will appear without fail at the"
6263,ARGUMENT,"appointed place. We will settle accounts; and, if God grants me his"
6264,ARGUMENT,"blessing, I will punish him, and then will swim over the Lososna, where"
6265,ARGUMENT,the ranks of my brothers await me. I have heard that my father in his will
6266,ARGUMENT,"bade me enter the army, and I have not heard that that will has been"
6267,ARGUMENT,"cancelled."""
6268,ARGUMENT,
6269,ARGUMENT,"""My dear Thaddeus,"" said his uncle, ""have you been scalded with boiling"
6270,ARGUMENT,"water, or are you dodging like a hunted fox that waves its brush in one"
6271,ARGUMENT,"direction and itself runs in another? We have challenged him, to be sure,"
6272,ARGUMENT,"and you will have to fight, but why are you so bent on going to-day?"
6273,ARGUMENT,Before a duel it is the custom to send friends and settle the terms; the
6274,ARGUMENT,"Count may still beg our pardon and make amends: just wait, there is still"
6275,ARGUMENT,time enough. Some other whimsy must be driving you away from here; speak
6276,ARGUMENT,"it out frankly: why such excuses? I am your uncle, and, though old, I know"
6277,ARGUMENT,"what young hearts are; I have been a father to you."" (As he spoke he"
6278,ARGUMENT,"stroked his nephew beneath the chin.) ""My little finger has already been"
6279,ARGUMENT,"whispering in my ear that you, sir, have been carrying on some intrigues"
6280,ARGUMENT,here with the ladies. Nowadays young men take to the ladies devilish
6281,ARGUMENT,"quick. But, my dear Thaddeus, confess it to me, and frankly."""
6282,ARGUMENT,
6283,ARGUMENT,"""That is the truth,"" mumbled Thaddeus, ""there are other causes, my beloved"
6284,ARGUMENT,"uncle! Perhaps it was my own fault! A mistake! No, a misfortune! It is now"
6285,ARGUMENT,"hard to correct it! No, dear uncle, I can stay here no longer. An error of"
6286,ARGUMENT,"youth! Uncle, do not question me further; I must depart from Soplicowo as"
6287,ARGUMENT,"quickly as may be."""
6288,ARGUMENT,
6289,ARGUMENT,"""Oho!"" said his uncle, ""this is certainly some love tiff. I noticed"
6290,ARGUMENT,yesterday that you bit your lips while you looked from under your eyebrows
6291,ARGUMENT,at a certain little girl; I saw that she too had a sour expression. I know
6292,ARGUMENT,"all that nonsense; when a pair of children fall in love, then they have no"
6293,ARGUMENT,"end of misfortunes. Now they feel happy, now again they are afflicted and"
6294,ARGUMENT,"cast down; now again, for God knows what reason, they are ready to bite"
6295,ARGUMENT,"each other; now they stand in corners as if playing blind man's buff, and"
6296,ARGUMENT,won't say a word to each other; sometimes they even run out into the
6297,ARGUMENT,"fields. If such an attack is upon you, just be patient, there is a cure"
6298,ARGUMENT,for all that; I will undertake to reconcile you shortly. I know all that
6299,ARGUMENT,"nonsense, I have been young myself. Tell me all about it; in return I too"
6300,ARGUMENT,"may reveal something, and thus we will confess ourselves to each other."""
6301,ARGUMENT,
6302,ARGUMENT,"""Uncle,"" said Thaddeus, kissing his hand and blushing, ""I will tell you"
6303,ARGUMENT,"the truth. I have taken a great liking to that little girl, Zosia, your"
6304,ARGUMENT,"ward, though I have seen her only a couple of times; but they tell me that"
6305,ARGUMENT,"you design for my wife the Chamberlain's daughter, a beautiful girl, and a"
6306,ARGUMENT,rich man's daughter. Now I could not marry Panna Rosa when I am in love
6307,ARGUMENT,"with Zosia; it is hard to change one's heart, but dishonourable to marry"
6308,ARGUMENT,when one loves another. Perhaps time will heal me; I shall depart--for a
6309,ARGUMENT,"long absence."""
6310,ARGUMENT,
6311,ARGUMENT,"""Thaddeus,"" interrupted his uncle, ""that is a strange way of being in"
6312,ARGUMENT,"love, to run away from one's belovèd. It is well that you are frank; you"
6313,ARGUMENT,"see, you would have committed an act of folly by going away. But what"
6314,ARGUMENT,"should you say if I helped you to obtain Zosia? Hey? Well, aren't you"
6315,ARGUMENT,"jumping for joy?"""
6316,ARGUMENT,
6317,ARGUMENT,"""Your goodness amazes me,"" said Thaddeus after a pause, ""but yet--the"
6318,ARGUMENT,"favour of my kind uncle will avail me nothing! Ah, my hopes are vain, for"
6319,ARGUMENT,"Pani Telimena will not yield me Zosia!"""
6320,ARGUMENT,
6321,ARGUMENT,"""We will ask her,"" said the Judge."
6322,ARGUMENT,
6323,ARGUMENT,"""No one can prevail upon her,"" interrupted Thaddeus hastily. ""No, I cannot"
6324,ARGUMENT,"wait, uncle; I must be on my way quickly, to-morrow. Only give me your"
6325,ARGUMENT,"blessing, uncle; I have made all my preparations, and am now leaving for"
6326,ARGUMENT,"the Grand Duchy."""
6327,ARGUMENT,
6328,ARGUMENT,"The Judge, twirling his mustaches, gazed angrily at the lad:--"
6329,ARGUMENT,
6330,ARGUMENT,"""Are you so frank? Have you opened your heart to me so fully? First that"
6331,ARGUMENT,"duel! Then again love and this departure; O, there is something behind all"
6332,ARGUMENT,"this! They have been telling me, I have watched your steps! You are a"
6333,ARGUMENT,"deceitful, giddy fellow; you have been telling lies. Where were you going"
6334,ARGUMENT,"that evening, and what were you tracking like a setter outside the house?"
6335,ARGUMENT,"See here, Thaddeus, maybe you have seduced Zosia and are now running away?"
6336,ARGUMENT,"If so, booby, you will not succeed! Whether you like it or not, I tell you"
6337,ARGUMENT,"that you shall marry Zosia. Otherwise, the horsewhip--to-morrow you shall"
6338,ARGUMENT,stand before the altar! And you talk to me of feelings--of an unchanging
6339,ARGUMENT,"heart! You are a liar! Foh! I'll look into your case, Pan Thaddeus, I'll"
6340,ARGUMENT,make your ears smart for you! I've had enough trouble to-day--till my head
6341,ARGUMENT,aches with it--and now you come to keep me from going to sleep in peace!
6342,ARGUMENT,"Now go to bed!"""
6343,ARGUMENT,
6344,ARGUMENT,So speaking he threw open the door and called the Apparitor to undress
6345,ARGUMENT,him.
6346,ARGUMENT,
6347,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus went out quietly, hanging his head, and thought over his bitter"
6348,ARGUMENT,interview with his uncle. It was the first time that he had ever been
6349,ARGUMENT,scolded so severely! He appreciated the justice of the reproaches and
6350,ARGUMENT,blushed at himself. What should he do? What if Zosia should learn the
6351,ARGUMENT,whole story? Should he ask for her hand? But what would Telimena say?
6352,ARGUMENT,No--he felt that he could remain no longer in Soplicowo.
6353,ARGUMENT,
6354,ARGUMENT,"Thus buried in thought, he had hardly made two steps when something"
6355,ARGUMENT,"crossed his path; he looked--and saw a phantom all in white, tall, frail,"
6356,ARGUMENT,"and slender. It approached him with an outstretched arm, from which was"
6357,ARGUMENT,"reflected the trembling light of the moon, and, stepping up to him, softly"
6358,ARGUMENT,moaned:--
6359,ARGUMENT,
6360,ARGUMENT,"""Ungrateful man! You sought my glance, and now you avoid it; you sought"
6361,ARGUMENT,"for speech with me, and to-day you close your ears, as though in my words"
6362,ARGUMENT,and in my glance there were poison! I deserve my fate; I knew who you
6363,ARGUMENT,"were! A man! Guiltless of coquetry, I did not wish to torture you, but"
6364,ARGUMENT,made you happy; and is this the gratitude you show me! A triumph over my
6365,ARGUMENT,"soft heart has hardened your heart; since you won it so easily, too"
6366,ARGUMENT,"quickly have you despised it! I deserve my fate; but, taught by bitter"
6367,ARGUMENT,"experience, believe me, that I despise myself more than you can despise"
6368,ARGUMENT,"me!"""
6369,ARGUMENT,
6370,ARGUMENT,"""Telimena,"" said Thaddeus, ""I vow to Heaven that my heart is not hard, nor"
6371,ARGUMENT,"do I avoid you through contempt. But just consider, they are watching us,"
6372,ARGUMENT,"following us; can we act so openly? What will people say? Why, this is"
6373,ARGUMENT,"improper, I vow--it is a sin!"""
6374,ARGUMENT,
6375,ARGUMENT,"""A sin!"" she answered him with a bitter smile. ""O you young innocent! you"
6376,ARGUMENT,"lamb! If I, who am a woman, from very force of love care not though I be"
6377,ARGUMENT,"discovered, and though I be put to shame--but you! you a man? What matters"
6378,ARGUMENT,"it to one of you men, even though he may confess that he has intrigues"
6379,ARGUMENT,"with a dozen sweethearts at a time? Speak the truth, you wish to desert"
6380,ARGUMENT,"me."""
6381,ARGUMENT,
6382,ARGUMENT,She dissolved in tears.
6383,ARGUMENT,
6384,ARGUMENT,"""Telimena,"" answered Thaddeus, ""what would the world say of a man, who"
6385,ARGUMENT,"now, at my time of life, in good health, should settle down in a village"
6386,ARGUMENT,"and pass his time making love--when so many young men, so many married men"
6387,ARGUMENT,"are leaving their wives and children and fleeing abroad, to the standards"
6388,ARGUMENT,"of their country? Although I might wish to remain, does it depend on me?"
6389,ARGUMENT,"My father in his will bade me enter the Polish army, and now my uncle has"
6390,ARGUMENT,repeated that command; to-morrow I depart; I have already made my
6391,ARGUMENT,"resolution, and with Heaven's aid, Telimena, I shall not change it."""
6392,ARGUMENT,
6393,ARGUMENT,"""I do not wish to bar your path to glory,"" said Telimena, ""or to hinder"
6394,ARGUMENT,"your happiness! You are a man, you will find a sweetheart worthier of your"
6395,ARGUMENT,"love; you will find one richer and fairer! Only for my consolation, let me"
6396,ARGUMENT,"know before we part that your liking for me was a true affection, that it"
6397,ARGUMENT,"was not merely a jest or wanton lust, but love; let me know that my"
6398,ARGUMENT,Thaddeus loves me! Let me hear once more from your lips the words 'I
6399,ARGUMENT,"love,' let me grave them in my heart, and write them in my thoughts; I"
6400,ARGUMENT,"shall forgive more easily, though you cease to love me, remembering how"
6401,ARGUMENT,"you have loved me!"""
6402,ARGUMENT,
6403,ARGUMENT,And she began to sob.
6404,ARGUMENT,
6405,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus, seeing that she wept and implored him so feelingly, and that she"
6406,ARGUMENT,"required of him only such a trifle, was moved; sincere sorrow and pity"
6407,ARGUMENT,"overcame him, and if he had searched the secrets of his heart, perhaps at"
6408,ARGUMENT,that moment he himself could not have told whether he loved her or not. So
6409,ARGUMENT,he spoke eagerly:--
6410,ARGUMENT,
6411,ARGUMENT,"""Telimena, so may God's bright lightning strike me, if it be not true that"
6412,ARGUMENT,"I have been fond of you--yes, that I have loved you deeply; short were the"
6413,ARGUMENT,"moments that we spent together, but so sweetly and so tenderly did they"
6414,ARGUMENT,"pass that for long, forever, will they be present to my thoughts, and"
6415,ARGUMENT,"Heaven knows that I shall never forget you!"""
6416,ARGUMENT,
6417,ARGUMENT,With a bound Telimena fell upon his neck:--
6418,ARGUMENT,
6419,ARGUMENT,"""This is what I have hoped for; you love me, so I still live! For to-day I"
6420,ARGUMENT,"was going to end my life by my own hand! Since you love me, my dear one,"
6421,ARGUMENT,"can you abandon me? To you I have given my heart, and to you I will give"
6422,ARGUMENT,my worldly goods; I will follow you everywhere; with you each corner of
6423,ARGUMENT,"the world will be charming; of the wildest wilderness love, believe me,"
6424,ARGUMENT,"will make a paradise!"""
6425,ARGUMENT,
6426,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus tore himself from her embrace by force. ""What?"" said he, ""are you"
6427,ARGUMENT,"mad? Follow me? Where? How? Shall I, being a common soldier, drag you"
6428,ARGUMENT,"after me, as a sutleress?"""
6429,ARGUMENT,
6430,ARGUMENT,"""Then we will be espoused,"" said Telimena."
6431,ARGUMENT,
6432,ARGUMENT,"""No, never!"" shouted Thaddeus. ""At present I have no intention whatever of"
6433,ARGUMENT,"marrying, nor of making love--nonsense! Let's drop the matter! I beg you,"
6434,ARGUMENT,"my dear, bethink yourself! Be calm! I am grateful to you, but it is"
6435,ARGUMENT,"impossible for us to marry; let us love each other, but just--in different"
6436,ARGUMENT,"places. I cannot remain longer; no, no, I must go. Farewell, my Telimena,"
6437,ARGUMENT,"I leave to-morrow."""
6438,ARGUMENT,
6439,ARGUMENT,"He spoke, pulled his hat over his eyes, and turned aside, meaning to"
6440,ARGUMENT,depart; but Telimena checked him with an eye and countenance like those of
6441,ARGUMENT,Medusa's head: against his will he had to remain; he looked with terror on
6442,ARGUMENT,"her form; she had become pale, without motion, breath, or life. At last,"
6443,ARGUMENT,"stretching out an arm like a sword to transfix him, with her finger aimed"
6444,ARGUMENT,"straight at the eyes of Thaddeus, she cried:--"
6445,ARGUMENT,
6446,ARGUMENT,"""This is what I wished! Ha, tongue of dragon, heart of viper! I care not"

6449,ARGUMENT,"for that I care not! You are a man, I know your falsity; I know that, like"
6450,ARGUMENT,"others, you too would be capable of breaking your plighted troth; but I"
6451,ARGUMENT,did not know that so basely you could lie! I have been listening by your
6452,ARGUMENT,uncle's door! So what about that child Zosia? Has she attracted your
6453,ARGUMENT,regard? And do you traitorously lay claim to her! Hardly had you deceived
6454,ARGUMENT,"one unfortunate, when already beneath her very eyes you were seeking new"
6455,ARGUMENT,"victims! Flee, but my curses will reach you--or remain, and I will publish"
6456,ARGUMENT,your perfidies to the world; your arts will no longer corrupt others as
6457,ARGUMENT,"they have corrupted me! Away! I despise you! You are a liar, a base man!"""
6458,ARGUMENT,
6459,ARGUMENT,"At this insult, mortal for a gentleman's ears, the like of which no"
6460,ARGUMENT,"Soplica had ever heard, Thaddeus trembled, and his face grew pale as that"
6461,ARGUMENT,"of a corpse. Stamping his foot and biting his lips, he muttered, ""Idiotic"
6462,ARGUMENT,"woman!"""
6463,ARGUMENT,
6464,ARGUMENT,"He walked away, but the epithet ""base"" echoed in his heart; the young man"
6465,ARGUMENT,"shuddered, and felt that he had deserved it; he felt that he had inflicted"
6466,ARGUMENT,a great wrong on Telimena; his conscience told him that she had reproached
6467,ARGUMENT,him justly: yet he felt that after those reproaches he loathed her more
6468,ARGUMENT,"violently than ever. Of Zosia, alas! he did not venture to think; he was"
6469,ARGUMENT,"ashamed. However, that very Zosia, so lovely and so charming, his uncle"
6470,ARGUMENT,"had been seeking to win for him! Perhaps she would have been his wife, had"
6471,ARGUMENT,"not a demon, after entangling him in sin after sin, lie after lie, at last"
6472,ARGUMENT,bade him adieu with a mocking laugh. He was rebuked and scorned by all! In
6473,ARGUMENT,a few short days he had ruined his future! He felt the just punishment of
6474,ARGUMENT,his crime.
6475,ARGUMENT,
6476,ARGUMENT,"In this storm of feelings, like an anchor of rest there suddenly flashed"
6477,ARGUMENT,"upon him the thought of the duel. ""I must slay the Count, the scoundrel!"""
6478,ARGUMENT,"he cried, ""I must perish or be avenged!"" But for what? That he did not"
6479,ARGUMENT,"know himself. And that great burst of anger, as it had come over him in"
6480,ARGUMENT,"the twinkling of an eye, so it vanished away; he was seized anew by a deep"
6481,ARGUMENT,"sadness. He meditated whether his observation might not be true, that the"
6482,ARGUMENT,"Count and Zosia had some mutual understanding. ""And what of that? Perhaps"
6483,ARGUMENT,"the Count sincerely loves Zosia; perhaps she loves him, and will choose"
6484,ARGUMENT,him for her husband! By what right could I desire to break off that
6485,ARGUMENT,"marriage; and, unhappy myself, to destroy the happiness of every one?"""
6486,ARGUMENT,
6487,ARGUMENT,He fell into despair and saw no other means except speedy flight. Whither?
6488,ARGUMENT,To the grave!
6489,ARGUMENT,
6490,ARGUMENT,"So, pressing his fist against his bent brow, he ran to the meadows, where,"
6491,ARGUMENT,"below, the ponds glittered, and took his stand above the one with marshy"
6492,ARGUMENT,banks; in its greenish depths he buried his greedy gaze and drew into his
6493,ARGUMENT,"breast with joy the swampy odours, and opened his lips to them; for"
6494,ARGUMENT,"suicide, like all wild passions, springs from the imagination: in the"
6495,ARGUMENT,giddy whirling of his brain he felt an unspeakable longing to drown
6496,ARGUMENT,himself in the swamp.
6497,ARGUMENT,
6498,ARGUMENT,"But Telimena, guessing the young man's despair from his wild gestures, and"
6499,ARGUMENT,"seeing that he had run towards the ponds, although she burned with such"
6500,ARGUMENT,"just wrath against him, was nevertheless alarmed; in reality she had a"
6501,ARGUMENT,kind heart. She had felt sorrow that Thaddeus dared to love another; she
6502,ARGUMENT,"had wished to punish him, but she had not thought of destroying him. So"
6503,ARGUMENT,"she rushed after him, raising both her arms and crying: ""Stop! What folly!"
6504,ARGUMENT,"Love me or not! Get married or depart! Only stop!----"" But in his swift"
6505,ARGUMENT,course he had far outstripped her; he already--was standing at the shore!
6506,ARGUMENT,
6507,ARGUMENT,"By a strange decree of fate, along that same shore was riding the Count,"
6508,ARGUMENT,"at the head of his band of jockeys; and, carried away by the charm of so"
6509,ARGUMENT,"fair a night, and by the marvellous harmony of that subaqueous orchestra,"
6510,ARGUMENT,of those choruses that rang like Æolian harps (for no frogs sing so
6511,ARGUMENT,"beautifully as those of Poland), he checked his horse and forgot about his"
6512,ARGUMENT,expedition. He turned his ear to the pond and listened curiously; he ran
6513,ARGUMENT,"his eyes over the fields, over the expanse of the heavens: he was"
6514,ARGUMENT,evidently composing in his thoughts a nocturnal landscape.
6515,ARGUMENT,
6516,ARGUMENT,"In very truth, the neighbourhood was picturesque! The two ponds inclined"
6517,ARGUMENT,their faces towards each other like a pair of lovers. The right pond had
6518,ARGUMENT,"waters smooth and pure as a maiden's cheeks; the left was somewhat darker,"
6519,ARGUMENT,"like the swarthy face of a youth, already shaded with manly down. The"
6520,ARGUMENT,right was encircled with glittering golden sand as if with bright hair;
6521,ARGUMENT,"but the brow of the left bristled with osiers, and was tufted with"
6522,ARGUMENT,willows: both ponds were clothed in a garment of green.
6523,ARGUMENT,
6524,ARGUMENT,"From them there flowed and met two streams, like hands clasped together:"
6525,ARGUMENT,"farther on the stream formed a waterfall; it fell, but did not perish, for"
6526,ARGUMENT,into the darkness of the ravine it bore upon its waves the golden shimmer
6527,ARGUMENT,"of the moon. The water fell in sheets, and on every sheet glittered skeins"
6528,ARGUMENT,"of moonbeams; the light in the ravine was dispersed into fine splinters,"
6529,ARGUMENT,"which the fleeing flood seized and carried off below, but from on high the"
6530,ARGUMENT,moonbeams fell in fresh skeins. You might have thought that by the pond a
6531,ARGUMENT,"nixie157 was sitting, and with one hand was pouring forth a fountain from"
6532,ARGUMENT,"a bottomless urn, while with the other she cast sportively into the water"
6533,ARGUMENT,handfuls of enchanted gold that she took from her apron.
6534,ARGUMENT,
6535,ARGUMENT,"Farther on, the brook, running out from the ravine, wound over the plain,"
6536,ARGUMENT,"and became quiet, but one could see that it still flowed, for along its"
6537,ARGUMENT,"moving, shimmering surface the quivering moonlight twinkled. As the fair"
6538,ARGUMENT,"serpent of Zmudz called _giwojtos_, though, lying amid the heather, it"
6539,ARGUMENT,"seems to slumber, still crawls along, for by turns it shows silver and"
6540,ARGUMENT,"golden, until it suddenly vanishes from the eye in the moss or ferns; so"
6541,ARGUMENT,"the brook wound and hid among the alders, which showed black on the far"
6542,ARGUMENT,"horizon, raising their light forms, indistinct to the eye, like spirits"
6543,ARGUMENT,half seen and half in mist.
6544,ARGUMENT,
6545,ARGUMENT,Between the ponds in the ravine a mill was hidden. As an old guardian who
6546,ARGUMENT,"is spying on two lovers and has heard their talk together, grows angry,"
6547,ARGUMENT,"storms, shakes his head and hands and stutters out threats against them;"
6548,ARGUMENT,so that mill suddenly shook its brow overgrown with moss and twirled
6549,ARGUMENT,around its many-fingered fist: hardly had it begun to clatter and stir its
6550,ARGUMENT,"sharp-toothed jaws, when at the same moment it deafened the love talk of"
6551,ARGUMENT,"the ponds, and awoke the Count."
6552,ARGUMENT,
6553,ARGUMENT,"The Count, seeing that Thaddeus had approached so near the spot where he"
6554,ARGUMENT,"had halted under arms, shouted: ""To arms! Seize him!"" The jockeys rushed"
6555,ARGUMENT,"forward, and, before Thaddeus could comprehend what was happening to him,"
6556,ARGUMENT,they had already caught him; they ran towards the mansion and poured into
6557,ARGUMENT,"the yard. The mansion awoke, the dogs barked, the watchmen shouted, the"
6558,ARGUMENT,Judge rushed out half clad; he saw the armed throng and thought that they
6559,ARGUMENT,"were robbers until he recognised the Count. ""What does this mean?"" he"
6560,ARGUMENT,"asked. The Count flashed his sword over him, but, when he saw that he was"
6561,ARGUMENT,"unarmed, his fury grew cool."
6562,ARGUMENT,
6563,ARGUMENT,"""Soplica,"" he said, ""ancestral enemy of my family, to-day I punish thee"
6564,ARGUMENT,for ancient and for fresh offences; to-day thou wilt render me an account
6565,ARGUMENT,for the seizure of my fortune before I avenge me for the insult to my
6566,ARGUMENT,"honour!"""
6567,ARGUMENT,
6568,ARGUMENT,But the Judge crossed himself and cried:--
6569,ARGUMENT,
6570,ARGUMENT,"""In the name of the Father and of the Son! foh! My Lord the Count, are you"
6571,ARGUMENT,"a robber? By God, does this befit your birth, your education, and the"
6572,ARGUMENT,"station you occupy in the world? I will not permit myself to be wronged!"""
6573,ARGUMENT,
6574,ARGUMENT,"Meanwhile the servants of the Judge had run up, some with clubs, others"
6575,ARGUMENT,"with guns; the Seneschal, standing some distance away, looked curiously"
6576,ARGUMENT,into the eyes of the Count--and held a knife in his sleeve.
6577,ARGUMENT,
6578,ARGUMENT,"They were already on the point of beginning battle, but the Judge"
6579,ARGUMENT,"prevented them; it was vain to offer any defence, for a new enemy was"
6580,ARGUMENT,"coming up. Among the alders they saw a flash, and heard the report of a"
6581,ARGUMENT,"carbine! The bridge over the river rattled with the trampling of cavalry,"
6582,ARGUMENT,"and a thousand voices thundered, ""Down with the Soplica!"" The Judge"
6583,ARGUMENT,"shuddered, for he recognised Gerwazy's watchword."
6584,ARGUMENT,
6585,ARGUMENT,"""This is nothing,"" cried the Count, ""there will soon be more of us here;"
6586,ARGUMENT,"submit, Judge, these are my allies."""
6587,ARGUMENT,
6588,ARGUMENT,Thereupon the Assessor ran up shouting:--
6589,ARGUMENT,
6590,ARGUMENT,"""I arrest you in the name of His Imperial Majesty! Yield your sword,"
6591,ARGUMENT,"Count, for I shall summon the aid of the army; and you are aware, that if"
6592,ARGUMENT,"any one dares to make a night attack under arms, it is provided by ukaz"
6593,ARGUMENT,"one thousand two hundred, that as a malef----"""
6594,ARGUMENT,
6595,ARGUMENT,Thereupon the Count struck him across the face with the flat of his sword.
6596,ARGUMENT,"The Assessor fell stunned, and disappeared among the nettles; all thought"
6597,ARGUMENT,that he was wounded or dead.
6598,ARGUMENT,
6599,ARGUMENT,"""I see,"" said the Judge, ""that this looks like brigandage."""
6600,ARGUMENT,
6601,ARGUMENT,"Every one shrieked; all were deafened by the wailing of Zosia, who,"
6602,ARGUMENT,"throwing her arms around the Judge, cried like a child pricked with"
6603,ARGUMENT,needles by Jews.
6604,ARGUMENT,
6605,ARGUMENT,Meanwhile Telimena had rushed among the horses and extended her clasped
6606,ARGUMENT,hands towards the Count.
6607,ARGUMENT,
6608,ARGUMENT,"""Upon your honour!"" she cried with a piercing voice, with head thrown back"
6609,ARGUMENT,"and with streaming hair. ""By all that is holy, we implore you on our"
6610,ARGUMENT,"knees! Count, will you dare to refuse? Ladies beg you; savage man, you"
6611,ARGUMENT,"must first murder _us_!"""
6612,ARGUMENT,
6613,ARGUMENT,"She fell in a faint.--The Count sprang to her aid, amazed and somewhat"
6614,ARGUMENT,disconcerted by this scene.
6615,ARGUMENT,
6616,ARGUMENT,"""Panna Sophia,"" he said, ""Pani Telimena, never shall this sword be stained"
6617,ARGUMENT,"with the blood of an unarmed foe! Soplicas, you are my prisoners. Thus did"
6618,ARGUMENT,"I in Italy, when beneath the crag that the Sicilians call Birbante-Rocca I"
6619,ARGUMENT,"overcame a camp of brigands; the armed I slew, those that laid down their"
6620,ARGUMENT,weapons I captured and had bound: they walked behind the steeds and
6621,ARGUMENT,"adorned my glorious triumph; then they were hanged at the foot of Etna."""
6622,ARGUMENT,
6623,ARGUMENT,"It was an especial piece of good luck for the Soplicas that the Count,"
6624,ARGUMENT,"having better horses than the gentry, and wishing to be the first in the"
6625,ARGUMENT,"engagement, had left them behind, and had galloped at least a mile 158 in"
6626,ARGUMENT,"advance of the rest of the cavalry, along with his jockeys, who were"
6627,ARGUMENT,"obedient and well disciplined, and formed a sort of regular army. For the"
6628,ARGUMENT,"rest of the gentry, as is usually the case with insurgents, were"
6629,ARGUMENT,"turbulent, and beyond measure quick at hanging. As it was, the Count had"
6630,ARGUMENT,"time to recover from his heat and wrath, and to deliberate how to end the"
6631,ARGUMENT,battle without bloodshed; so he gave orders to lock the Soplica family in
6632,ARGUMENT,"the mansion as prisoners of war, and stationed guards at the doors."
6633,ARGUMENT,
6634,ARGUMENT,"Then with a shout of ""Down with the Soplicas!"" the gentry rushed on in a"
6635,ARGUMENT,"body, surrounded the estate and took it by storm, so much the more easily"
6636,ARGUMENT,since the leader had been captured and the garrison had run away; but the
6637,ARGUMENT,conquerors wanted to fight and looked for an enemy. Not being admitted to
6638,ARGUMENT,"the mansion, they ran to the farmhouse, to the kitchen--when they entered"
6639,ARGUMENT,"the kitchen, the sight of the pots, the hardly extinct fire, the fresh"
6640,ARGUMENT,"smell of cooked food, the crunching of the dogs, which were gnawing the"
6641,ARGUMENT,"remains of the supper, appealed to the hearts of all, and changed the"
6642,ARGUMENT,"current of their thoughts; it cooled their wrath, but inflamed their"
6643,ARGUMENT,"desire for food. Wearied by the march and by an entire day of debate, they"
6644,ARGUMENT,"thrice shouted with one voice, ""Eat, eat!"" to which there came a reply of"
6645,ARGUMENT,"""Drink, drink!"" from among the throng of gentry. There arose two choruses,"
6646,ARGUMENT,"some crying ""Drink!"" and others ""Eat!""--the watchwords flew and echoed, and"
6647,ARGUMENT,wherever they reached they made mouths water and stomachs feel empty. And
6648,ARGUMENT,"so, at a signal given from the kitchen, the army unexpectedly dispersed"
6649,ARGUMENT,for foraging.
6650,ARGUMENT,
6651,ARGUMENT,"Gerwazy, repulsed from the Judge's rooms, had to retire, out of regard for"
6652,ARGUMENT,"the Count's watchmen. So, not being able to take vengeance on his enemy,"
6653,ARGUMENT,he bethought himself of the second great aim of this expedition. As a man
6654,ARGUMENT,"experienced and adept in legal matters, he wished to establish the Count"
6655,ARGUMENT,"in his new possessions legally and formally; so he ran for the Apparitor,"
6656,ARGUMENT,"and at last, after long search, discovered him behind the stove."
6657,ARGUMENT,"Straight-way he seized him by the collar, dragged him to the yard, and,"
6658,ARGUMENT,"pointing his penknife at his breast, spoke thus:--"
6659,ARGUMENT,
6660,ARGUMENT,"""Mr. Apparitor, my Lord the Count ventures to ask Your Honour that you"
6661,ARGUMENT,would be so kind as immediately to proclaim before the gentlemen and
6662,ARGUMENT,"brethren the establishment of the Count in the castle, in the estate of"
6663,ARGUMENT,"the Soplicas, the village, the sown fields, the fallow land, in a word,"
6664,ARGUMENT,"_cum grovibus, forestis et borderibus; peasantibus, bailiffis, et omnibus"
6665,ARGUMENT,rebus et quibusdam aliis_.  You know the formula; so bark it out: don't
6666,ARGUMENT,"leave out anything."""
6667,ARGUMENT,
6668,ARGUMENT,"""Mr. Warden, wait awhile,"" said Protazy boldly, thrusting his hands into"
6669,ARGUMENT,"his belt. ""I am ready to carry out all the orders of the contending"
6670,ARGUMENT,"parties, but I warn you that the act will not be valid, being extorted by"
6671,ARGUMENT,"violence and proclaimed by night."""
6672,ARGUMENT,
6673,ARGUMENT,"""What violence?"" said the Warden. ""There is no assault here. Why, I am"
6674,ARGUMENT,"asking you politely; if it is too dark for you, then I will kindle a fire"
6675,ARGUMENT,with my penknife so that it will be as bright in your peepers as in seven
6676,ARGUMENT,"churches."""
6677,ARGUMENT,
6678,ARGUMENT,"""My dear Gerwazy,"" said the Apparitor, ""why be so huffy? I am an"
6679,ARGUMENT,apparitor; it is not my business to discuss the case. Everybody knows that
6680,ARGUMENT,a party to a suit summons an apparitor and dictates to him whatever he
6681,ARGUMENT,"chooses, and the apparitor proclaims it. The apparitor is the ambassador"
6682,ARGUMENT,"of the law, and ambassadors are not subject to punishment, so that I do"
6683,ARGUMENT,not know why you keep me under guard. I will immediately write an act if
6684,ARGUMENT,"some one will only bring me a lantern, but meanwhile I proclaim: Brothers,"
6685,ARGUMENT,"come to order!"""
6686,ARGUMENT,
6687,ARGUMENT,"And in order to make his voice carry better, he stepped up on a great heap"
6688,ARGUMENT,"of beams (near the garden fence beams were drying); he climbed on them,"
6689,ARGUMENT,"and at once, as if the wind had blown him away, he vanished from sight;"
6690,ARGUMENT,"they heard how he plumped into the cabbage patch, they saw how his white"
6691,ARGUMENT,"hat flitted like a dove over the dark hemp. Bucket shot at the hat, but"
6692,ARGUMENT,missed his aim; then there was a crackling of poles--Protazy was already in
6693,ARGUMENT,"the hop patch. ""I protest,"" he shouted; he was sure of escape, for behind"
6694,ARGUMENT,him he had swamps and the bed of the stream.
6695,ARGUMENT,
6696,ARGUMENT,"After this protest, which resounded like the last cannon shot on conquered"
6697,ARGUMENT,"ramparts, all resistance subsided in the mansion of the Soplicas. The"
6698,ARGUMENT,hungry gentry pillaged and seized upon whatever they could find.
6699,ARGUMENT,"Sprinkler, taking his stand in the cow-shed, sprinkled an ox and two"
6700,ARGUMENT,"calves on the brows, and Razor plunged his sabre in their throats. Awl"
6701,ARGUMENT,"with equal diligence employed his sword, sticking hogs and sucking pigs"
6702,ARGUMENT,beneath the shoulder blades. And now slaughter threatened the poultry--a
6703,ARGUMENT,watchful flock of those geese that once saved Rome from the treachery of
6704,ARGUMENT,"the Gauls, in vain cackled for aid; in place of Manlius, Bucket attacked"
6705,ARGUMENT,"the coop, strangled some of the birds, and tied others alive to the girdle"
6706,ARGUMENT,"of his kontusz. In vain the geese called out hoarsely, winding their necks"
6707,ARGUMENT,about; in vain the ganders hissed and nipped their assailant. He ran;
6708,ARGUMENT,"besprinkled with the glittering down, borne forward as if on wheels by the"
6709,ARGUMENT,"motion of the close-packed wings, he seemed to be Chochlik, the winged"
6710,ARGUMENT,evil spirit.159
6711,ARGUMENT,
6712,ARGUMENT,"But the most terrible slaughter, though the least uproar, was among the"
6713,ARGUMENT,"hens. Young Buzzard assaulted the hencoop, and, catching them with a cord,"
6714,ARGUMENT,he pulled down from the roosts the cocks and the rough-feathered and
6715,ARGUMENT,crested hens; one after another he strangled them and laid them in a heap;
6716,ARGUMENT,"lovely birds, fed upon pearl barley. Heedless Buzzard, what fervour"
6717,ARGUMENT,carried thee away! Never after this wilt thou win thy pardon from the
6718,ARGUMENT,angry Zosia!
6719,ARGUMENT,
6720,ARGUMENT,"Gerwazy called to mind the days of old, and bade them give him the belts"
6721,ARGUMENT,"from their kontuszes, and with them he drew from the Soplicas' cellar"
6722,ARGUMENT,"casks of old brandy, mead, and beer. Some they broached at once; others"
6723,ARGUMENT,"the gentry, thick as ants, seized with a will and rolled to the castle."
6724,ARGUMENT,There the whole throng gathered for the night encampment; there were
6725,ARGUMENT,established the Count's headquarters.
6726,ARGUMENT,
6727,ARGUMENT,"They laid a hundred fires, boiled, broiled, and roasted; the tables bent"
6728,ARGUMENT,"beneath the meat, and drink flowed in a river. The gentry were minded to"
6729,ARGUMENT,"eat, drink, and sing the whole night through, but slowly they began to"
6730,ARGUMENT,"doze and yawn; eye after eye was extinguished, and the whole company"
6731,ARGUMENT,"nodded their heads; each fell where he sat, one with a platter, one over a"
6732,ARGUMENT,"tankard, one by a quarter of beef. Thus the victors were conquered at last"
6733,ARGUMENT,"by Sleep, the brother of Death."

6757,ARGUMENT,And they snored in so sound a sleep that they were not wakened by the
6758,ARGUMENT,"gleam of lanterns and the entry of some dozens of men, who fell upon the"
6759,ARGUMENT,"gentry as wall spiders, called _mowers_, upon drowsy flies; scarcely does"
6760,ARGUMENT,one of them have time to buzz before the grim master encircles it around
6761,ARGUMENT,with long legs and strangles it. The sleep of the gentry was still sounder
6762,ARGUMENT,"than the sleep of flies: not a one buzzed; all lay as if lifeless, though"
6763,ARGUMENT,"they were seized by strong arms, and thrown about like straw when it is"
6764,ARGUMENT,bound into sheaves.
6765,ARGUMENT,
6766,ARGUMENT,"Bucket alone, whose head was strongest at a banquet of all those in the"
6767,ARGUMENT,"district; Bucket, who could drink two butts of mead before his tongue"
6768,ARGUMENT,"faltered and his legs tottered--Bucket, though long had he feasted and"
6769,ARGUMENT,"deeply did he slumber, still gave a sign of life; he blinked with one eye,"
6770,ARGUMENT,"and saw!--real nightmares! two dreadful faces directly above him, and each"
6771,ARGUMENT,"had a pair of mustaches. They breathed upon him, and touched his lips with"
6772,ARGUMENT,"their mustaches, and flourished about four hands like wings. He was"
6773,ARGUMENT,"terrified, and wanted to cross him self, but he tried in vain to stir his"
6774,ARGUMENT,arm; his right arm seemed pinned to his side. He strove to move his
6775,ARGUMENT,left--alas! he found that the spirits had wrapt him tight as a babe in
6776,ARGUMENT,swaddling bands. He was terrified still more frightfully; immediately he
6777,ARGUMENT,closed his eyes and lay without breathing; he grew cold and was near to
6778,ARGUMENT,death.
6779,ARGUMENT,
6780,ARGUMENT,"But Sprinkler made an effort to defend himself, too late! For he was"
6781,ARGUMENT,"already bound fast in his own belt. However, he twisted himself about and"
6782,ARGUMENT,leapt up with such a spring that he fell back on the breasts of the
6783,ARGUMENT,"sleeping men and rolled over their heads; he tossed like a pike, when it"
6784,ARGUMENT,"writhes on the sand, and roared like a bear, for he had strong lungs. He"
6785,ARGUMENT,"roared: ""Treachery!"" At once the whole company awoke and answered in"
6786,ARGUMENT,"chorus: ""Treachery! Violence! Treachery!"""
6787,ARGUMENT,
6788,ARGUMENT,"The cry went echoing to the mirror room, where slept the Count, Gerwazy,"
6789,ARGUMENT,"and the jockeys. Gerwazy awoke, and in vain struggled to free himself, for"
6790,ARGUMENT,"he was tied fast at full length to his own sword; he looked about, and saw"
6791,ARGUMENT,"by the window armed men, in short, black helmets and green uniforms. One"
6792,ARGUMENT,"of them, girt with a scarf, held a sword, and with its point directed his"
6793,ARGUMENT,"company of men, whispering: ""Bind! Bind!"" Around him lay the jockeys, tied"
6794,ARGUMENT,"up like sheep; the Count was sitting unbound but without arms, and by him"
6795,ARGUMENT,stood two private soldiers with bare bayonets--Gerwazy recognised them:
6796,ARGUMENT,alas! the Muscovites!!!
6797,ARGUMENT,
6798,ARGUMENT,"Often had the Warden been in like distress, often had he felt ropes on his"
6799,ARGUMENT,"arms and legs; and yet he had freed himself, for he knew a way of breaking"
6800,ARGUMENT,bands: he was very strong and trusted in himself. He planned to save
6801,ARGUMENT,"himself by silence; he closed his eyes as if he were asleep, slowly"
6802,ARGUMENT,"stretched out his arms and legs, held his breath, and contracted his belly"
6803,ARGUMENT,"and his chest to the utmost; then suddenly he grew short, puffed himself"
6804,ARGUMENT,"out, and doubled up: as a serpent, when it hides its head and tail in its"
6805,ARGUMENT,"coils, so Gerwazy became short and thick instead of long. The cords"
6806,ARGUMENT,"stretched and even creaked, but did not break! From very shame and terror"
6807,ARGUMENT,the Warden turned over and hid his angry face upon the floor; closing his
6808,ARGUMENT,eyes he lay senseless as a log.
6809,ARGUMENT,
6810,ARGUMENT,"Then the drums began to roll, at first slowly, then with a rumble that"
6811,ARGUMENT,became ever faster and louder; at this signal the Muscovite officer gave
6812,ARGUMENT,"orders to lock up the Count and the jockeys in the hall, under guard, but"
6813,ARGUMENT,"to take the gentry out into the yard, where the other company was"
6814,ARGUMENT,stationed. In vain Sprinkler fumed and struggled.
6815,ARGUMENT,
6816,ARGUMENT,"The staff was stationed in the yard, and with it many armed gentry, the"
6817,ARGUMENT,"Podhajskis, Birbaszes, Hreczechas, Biergels, all friends or kinsmen of the"
6818,ARGUMENT,Judge. They had hastened to his relief when they heard of the attack upon
6819,ARGUMENT,"him, the more eagerly since they had long been at odds with the"
6820,ARGUMENT,Dobrzynskis.
6821,ARGUMENT,
6822,ARGUMENT,Who had summoned the battalion of Muscovites from the villages? Who had
6823,ARGUMENT,gathered so quickly the neighbours from the hamlets? Was it the Assessor
6824,ARGUMENT,"or Jankiel? As to this there were various rumours, but no one knew with"
6825,ARGUMENT,certainty either then or later.
6826,ARGUMENT,
6827,ARGUMENT,"Already the sun was rising, and showed blood-red; its blunt edge, as if"
6828,ARGUMENT,"stripped of beams, was half visible and half hidden in the black clouds,"
6829,ARGUMENT,"like a heated horseshoe in the charcoal of a forge. The wind was rising,"
6830,ARGUMENT,"and it drove on the clouds from the east, crowded and jagged as blocks of"
6831,ARGUMENT,ice; each cloud as it passed over sprinkled cold rain; behind it rushed
6832,ARGUMENT,the wind and dried the rain again; after the wind again a damp cloud flew
6833,ARGUMENT,by; and thus the day by turns was cold and drizzly.
6834,ARGUMENT,
6835,ARGUMENT,Meanwhile the Major had given orders to drag up the beams that were drying
6836,ARGUMENT,"near the yard, and in each beam to cut with an axe semicircular notches;"
6837,ARGUMENT,into these notches he thrust the legs of the prisoners and closed them
6838,ARGUMENT,"with another beam. The two logs, nailed together at the ends, fastened"
6839,ARGUMENT,upon the legs like the jaws of a bulldog; with cords they tied the arms of
6840,ARGUMENT,the gentry still more tightly behind their backs. The Major for their
6841,ARGUMENT,"further torment had already had their caps pulled from their heads, and"
6842,ARGUMENT,"from their backs their cloaks, their kontuszes, and even their"
6843,ARGUMENT,"jackets--even their tunics. Thus the gentry, fastened in the stocks, sat in"
6844,ARGUMENT,"a row, chattering their teeth in the cold and the rain, for the drizzle"
6845,ARGUMENT,kept increasing. In vain Sprinkler fumed and struggled.
6846,ARGUMENT,
6847,ARGUMENT,"Vainly the Judge interceded for the gentry, and vainly Telimena joined her"
6848,ARGUMENT,"entreaties to the tears of Zosia, that they should have more regard for"
6849,ARGUMENT,"the captives. Captain Nikita Rykov, to be sure--a Muscovite but a good"
6850,ARGUMENT,"fellow--allowed himself to be mollified; but this was of no avail, since he"
6851,ARGUMENT,himself had to obey Major Plut.160
6852,ARGUMENT,
6853,ARGUMENT,"This Major, by birth a Pole from the little town of Dzierowicze, according"
6854,ARGUMENT,"to report, had been named Plutowicz in Polish, but had changed his name;"
6855,ARGUMENT,"he was a great rascal, as is usually the case with Poles that turn"
6856,ARGUMENT,"Muscovites in the Tsar's service. Plut, with his pipe in his mouth and his"
6857,ARGUMENT,"hands on his hips, stood in front of the ranks of soldiers; when people"
6858,ARGUMENT,"bowed to him, he turned up his nose, and in answer, as a sign of his"
6859,ARGUMENT,"wrathful humour, he puffed out a cloud of smoke and walked towards the"
6860,ARGUMENT,house.
6861,ARGUMENT,
6862,ARGUMENT,"But meanwhile the Judge had been appeasing Rykov, and likewise taking"
6863,ARGUMENT,aside the Assessor. They were consulting how to end the affair out of
6864,ARGUMENT,"court, and, what was still more important, without interference from the"
6865,ARGUMENT,government. So Captain Rykov said to Major Plut:--
6866,ARGUMENT,
6867,ARGUMENT,"""Major, what do we want of all these captives? If we send them up for"
6868,ARGUMENT,"trial, there will be great trouble for the gentry of the district, and no"
6869,ARGUMENT,"one will give you any reward for it, sir. I tell you, Major, it will be"
6870,ARGUMENT,better to settle the matter quietly; the Judge will have to reward you for
6871,ARGUMENT,"your pains, and we will say that we came here on a visit: thus the goats"
6872,ARGUMENT,will be whole and the wolf will be full. There is a Russian proverb: 'All
6873,ARGUMENT,"can be done--with caution!' and another proverb, 'Roast your own meat on"
6874,ARGUMENT,"the Tsar's spit,' and a third proverb, 'Harmony is better than discord.'"
6875,ARGUMENT,Tie the knot tight and put the ends in the water. We will not make a
6876,ARGUMENT,"report, so that nobody will find out. 'God gave hands to take with'--that"
6877,ARGUMENT,"is a Russian proverb."""
6878,ARGUMENT,
6879,ARGUMENT,When he heard this the Major rose and exploded with wrath:--
6880,ARGUMENT,
6881,ARGUMENT,"""Are you mad, Rykov? This is the Imperial service, and service is not"
6882,ARGUMENT,"friendship, you idiotic old Rykov! Are you mad? Shall I discharge rebels!"
6883,ARGUMENT,"In these warlike times! Ha, my Polish friends, I'll teach you rebellion!"
6884,ARGUMENT,"Ha, you rascally Dobrzynski gentlemen; O, I know you--let the rascals"
6885,ARGUMENT,"soak!"" (And he guffawed, as he looked out of the window.) ""Why, that same"
6886,ARGUMENT,"Dobrzynski who is sitting with his coat on--hey, take off his coat!--last"
6887,ARGUMENT,year at the masked ball started that squabble with me. Who began it?
6888,ARGUMENT,"He--not I. I was dancing, and he yelled, 'Turn the scoundrel out!' Since I"
6889,ARGUMENT,was just then under investigation for stealing from the regimental
6890,ARGUMENT,"treasury, I was much embarrassed; but what business was it of his? I was"
6891,ARGUMENT,"dancing the mazurka, and he shouted from behind, 'Scoundrel!' The gentry"
6892,ARGUMENT,after him cried 'Hurrah!' They insulted me. Well? The beggarly gentleman
6893,ARGUMENT,"has fallen into my claws. I said to him: 'See here, Dobrzynski, the goat"
6894,ARGUMENT,"will come to the butcher's waggon!' Well, Dobrzynski, switches are cut for"
6895,ARGUMENT,"you, you see!"""
6896,ARGUMENT,
6897,ARGUMENT,Then he bent over and whispered into the Judge's ear:--
6898,ARGUMENT,
6899,ARGUMENT,"""Judge, if you want to have this matter hushed up, a thousand rubles cash"
6900,ARGUMENT,"for each head. A thousand rubles, Judge, that's my last word."""
6901,ARGUMENT,
6902,ARGUMENT,"The Judge tried to bargain, but the Major would not listen; once more he"
6903,ARGUMENT,"stalked about the room and puffed out clouds of smoke, like a squib or a"
6904,ARGUMENT,"rocket. The women followed him, imploring and weeping."
6905,ARGUMENT,
6906,ARGUMENT,"""Major,"" said the Judge, ""even if you go to law, what will you gain? There"
6907,ARGUMENT,"has been no bloody battle here, and no wounds; for their eating of hens"
6908,ARGUMENT,and geese they will pay fines according to the statute. I shall not make
6909,ARGUMENT,complaint against the Count; this was only an ordinary squabble between
6910,ARGUMENT,"neighbours."""
6911,ARGUMENT,
6912,ARGUMENT,"""Judge,"" said the Major, ""have you read the _Yellow Book_?""161"
6913,ARGUMENT,
6914,ARGUMENT,"""What yellow book?""  asked the Judge."
6915,ARGUMENT,
6916,ARGUMENT,"""A book,"" said the Major, ""that is better than all your statutes, and in"
6917,ARGUMENT,"it every other word is _halter_, _Siberia_, _the knout_; the book of"
6918,ARGUMENT,"martial law, now proclaimed throughout all Lithuania: your tribunals are"
6919,ARGUMENT,"now on the shelf. According to martial law, for such pranks you will at"
6920,ARGUMENT,"the very least be sent to hard labour in Siberia."""
6921,ARGUMENT,
6922,ARGUMENT,"""I appeal to the Governor,"" said the Judge."
6923,ARGUMENT,
6924,ARGUMENT,"""Appeal to the Emperor if you want to,"" said Plut. ""You know that when the"
6925,ARGUMENT,"Emperor confirms decrees, he often by his grace doubles the penalty."
6926,ARGUMENT,"Appeal, and perhaps in case of need, my dear Judge, I shall get a good"
6927,ARGUMENT,"hold on you too. Jankiel, a spy whom the government has long been"
6928,ARGUMENT,"tracking, is a frequenter of your house and the tenant of your tavern. I"
6929,ARGUMENT,"may now put every one of you under arrest at once."""
6930,ARGUMENT,
6931,ARGUMENT,"""Arrest me?"" said the Judge. ""How do you dare without orders?"""
6932,ARGUMENT,
6933,ARGUMENT,"And the dispute was becoming more and more lively, when a new guest rode"
6934,ARGUMENT,into the farmyard.
6935,ARGUMENT,
6936,ARGUMENT,"A strange throng was coming in. In front, like a courier, ran an immense"
6937,ARGUMENT,"black ram, whose brow bristled with four horns, two of which were decked"
6938,ARGUMENT,"with bells and curled about his ears, and two jutted out sidewise from his"
6939,ARGUMENT,"forehead and were hung with small, round, tinkling brass balls. After the"
6940,ARGUMENT,ram came oxen and a flock of sheep and goats; behind the cattle were four
6941,ARGUMENT,heavily loaded waggons.
6942,ARGUMENT,
6943,ARGUMENT,"All divined that Father Robak, the Alms-Gatherer, had arrived. So the"
6944,ARGUMENT,"Judge, knowing his duty as host, took his stand on the threshold, to"
6945,ARGUMENT,"welcome the guest. The Monk rode on the first wain, his face half hidden"
6946,ARGUMENT,"by his cowl; but they immediately recognised him, for, when he passed the"
6947,ARGUMENT,"prisoners, he turned his countenance towards them and made a sign to them"
6948,ARGUMENT,"with his finger. And the driver of the second wain was equally well known,"
6949,ARGUMENT,"old Maciek, the Switch, disguised as a peasant. The gentry began to shout"
6950,ARGUMENT,"as soon as he appeared; he said only ""Idiots!"" and imposed silence by a"
6951,ARGUMENT,"gesture. On the third waggon was the Prussian, in a torn overcoat; and Zan"
6952,ARGUMENT,and Mickiewicz rode on the fourth.
6953,ARGUMENT,
6954,ARGUMENT,"Meanwhile the Podhajskis and the Isajewiczes, the Birbaszes, Wilbiks,"
6955,ARGUMENT,"Biergels, and Kotwiczes, seeing the Dobrzynskis under so severe"
6956,ARGUMENT,"constraint, began slowly to cool down from their former wrath; for the"
6957,ARGUMENT,"Polish gentry, though beyond measure quarrelsome and eager for fighting,"
6958,ARGUMENT,are nevertheless not vindictive. So they ran to old Maciej for counsel. He
6959,ARGUMENT,stationed the whole crowd about the waggons and told them to wait.
6960,ARGUMENT,
6961,ARGUMENT,"The Bernardine entered the room. They hardly recognised him, though he had"
6962,ARGUMENT,not changed his clothes--his bearing was so different. He was ordinarily
6963,ARGUMENT,"gloomy and thoughtful, but now he held his head high, and with a radiant"
6964,ARGUMENT,"mien, like a jolly monk, he laughed long before he began to talk:--"
6965,ARGUMENT,
6966,ARGUMENT,"""Ha! ha! ha! ha! My respects, my respects! Ha! ha! ha! Excellent,"
6967,ARGUMENT,"first-class! Officers, some people hunt by day, but you by night! The"
6968,ARGUMENT,"hunting was good; I have seen the game. Pluck, pluck the gentry, peel them"
6969,ARGUMENT,"well; bridle them, for the gentry sometimes kick! I congratulate you,"
6970,ARGUMENT,"Major, that you have caught the young Count; he is a fat morsel, a rich"
6971,ARGUMENT,"fellow, a young man of old family; don't let him out of the cage without"
6972,ARGUMENT,"getting three hundred ducats for him; and when you have them, give some"
6973,ARGUMENT,"three-pence for my monastery and for me, for I always pray for your soul."
6974,ARGUMENT,"As I am a Bernardine, I am very anxious about your soul! Death pulls even"
6975,ARGUMENT,staff-officers by the ears. Baka162 wrote well--that Death seizes on
6976,ARGUMENT,"sinners at dinners, and on silken frocks she often knocks, and monks'"
6977,ARGUMENT,"cowls she slashes like satin sashes, and the curb of girls she raps like"
6978,ARGUMENT,"shoulder-straps. Mother Death, says Baka, like an onion, brings tears from"
6979,ARGUMENT,"the dears she embraces, and fondles alike both the baby that drowses and"
6980,ARGUMENT,"the rake that carouses! Ah! ah! Major, to-day we live and to-morrow we"
6981,ARGUMENT,"rot; that only is ours which to-day we eat and drink! Judge, doesn't it"
6982,ARGUMENT,"seem to you time for breakfast? I take my seat at the table, and beg all"
6983,ARGUMENT,"to be seated with me. Major, how about some stewed beef and gravy?"
6984,ARGUMENT,"Lieutenant, what's your idea? Should you like a bowl of good punch?"""
6985,ARGUMENT,
6986,ARGUMENT,"""That's a fact, Father,"" said two officers; ""it's time to be eating, and"
6987,ARGUMENT,"to drink the Judge's health!"""
6988,ARGUMENT,
6989,ARGUMENT,"The household, gazing at Robak, marvelled whence he had got such a bearing"
6990,ARGUMENT,and such jollity. The Judge at once repeated the orders to the cook; they
6991,ARGUMENT,"brought in a bowl, sugar, bottles, and stewed beef. Plut and Rykov set to"
6992,ARGUMENT,work briskly; and so greedily did they feed and so copiously did they
6993,ARGUMENT,"drink, that in a half hour they had eaten twenty-three plates of the"
6994,ARGUMENT,stewed beef and emptied an enormous half bowl of punch.
6995,ARGUMENT,
6996,ARGUMENT,"So the Major, full and merry, lolled in his chair, took out his pipe,"
6997,ARGUMENT,"lighted it with a bank note, and, wiping the breakfast from his lips with"
6998,ARGUMENT,"the end of a napkin, turned his laughing eyes on the women, and said:--"
6999,ARGUMENT,
7000,ARGUMENT,"""Fair ladies, I like you as dessert! By my major's epaulets, when a man"
7001,ARGUMENT,"has eaten breakfast, the best relish after the stewed beef is chatting"
7002,ARGUMENT,with such fair ladies as you fair ladies! I tell you what: let's have a
7003,ARGUMENT,"game of cards, of vingt et un or whist; or shall we start a mazurka? Hey,"
7004,ARGUMENT,"in the name of three hundred devils, why, I am the best dancer of the"
7005,ARGUMENT,"mazurka in the whole yager regiment!"""
7006,ARGUMENT,
7007,ARGUMENT,"Thereupon he leaned forward closer to the ladies, and puffed out smoke and"
7008,ARGUMENT,compliments by turns.
7009,ARGUMENT,
7010,ARGUMENT,"""Let's dance!"" cried Robak. ""When I have finished my bottle, though a"
7011,ARGUMENT,"monk, I occasionally tuck up my gown, and dance a bit of a mazurka! But"
7012,ARGUMENT,"you see, Major, we are drinking here and the yagers are freezing there in"
7013,ARGUMENT,"the yard. Sport is sport! Judge, give them a keg of brandy; the Major will"
7014,ARGUMENT,"permit it; let the bold yagers have a drink!"""
7015,ARGUMENT,
7016,ARGUMENT,"""I might beg the favour,"" said the Major, ""but you are not forced to grant"
7017,ARGUMENT,"it."""
7018,ARGUMENT,
7019,ARGUMENT,"""Judge,"" whispered Robak, ""give 'em a keg of spirits."""
7020,ARGUMENT,
7021,ARGUMENT,"And thus, while the merry staff tippled in the mansion, outside the house"
7022,ARGUMENT,there began a drinking bout among the troops.
7023,ARGUMENT,
7024,ARGUMENT,Captain Rykov drained cup after cup in silence; but the Major drank and at
7025,ARGUMENT,"the same time paid court to the ladies, and the ardour for dancing"
7026,ARGUMENT,continually increased within him. He threw aside his pipe and seized
7027,ARGUMENT,"Telimena's hand; he was eager to dance, but she ran away; so he went up to"
7028,ARGUMENT,"Zosia, and bowing and tottering invited her to open the mazurka."
7029,ARGUMENT,
7030,ARGUMENT,"""Hey you, Rykov, stop pulling at your pipe! Put away your pipe; you play"
7031,ARGUMENT,"the balalaika well. You see that guitar there; go, get the guitar and give"
7032,ARGUMENT,"us a mazurka! I, the Major, will lead out in the first couple."""
7033,ARGUMENT,
7034,ARGUMENT,The Captain took the guitar and began to tune it; Plut again urged
7035,ARGUMENT,Telimena to dance:--
7036,ARGUMENT,
7037,ARGUMENT,"""On the word of a Major, madam, I am not a Russian if I lie! May I be the"
7038,ARGUMENT,"son of a bitch if I lie! Ask, and all the officers will bear witness, all"
7039,ARGUMENT,"the army will tell you that in the second army, ninth corps, second"
7040,ARGUMENT,"division of infantry, fiftieth yager regiment, Major Plut is the foremost"
7041,ARGUMENT,"dancer of the mazurka. Come on, young lady! Don't be so skittish, for I"
7042,ARGUMENT,"shall punish you in officer's fashion."""
7043,ARGUMENT,
7044,ARGUMENT,"So saying he jumped up, seized Telimena's hand, and imprinted a broad kiss"
7045,ARGUMENT,"on her white shoulder; but Thaddeus, darting in from the side, slapped his"
7046,ARGUMENT,"face. The kiss and the blow resounded together, one after the other, as"
7047,ARGUMENT,word after word.
7048,ARGUMENT,
7049,ARGUMENT,"The Major was dumbfounded, rubbed his eyes, and, pale with wrath, shouted,"
7050,ARGUMENT,"""Rebellion, a rebel!""--and, drawing his sword, rushed to run him through."
7051,ARGUMENT,"Then the Monk took a pistol from his sleeve, and cried: ""Shoot, Thaddeus,"
7052,ARGUMENT,"aim for the bull's eye."" Thaddeus at once seized it, aimed, and shot; he"
7053,ARGUMENT,"missed, but he deafened and scorched the Major. Rykov started up with his"
7054,ARGUMENT,"guitar, crying, ""Rebellion! rebellion!"" and made for Thaddeus; but from"
7055,ARGUMENT,the other side of the table the Seneschal swung his arm with a left-hand
7056,ARGUMENT,"motion, and a knife whistled through the air between the heads of the"
7057,ARGUMENT,company and struck before they saw it flash. It struck the bottom of the
7058,ARGUMENT,guitar and pierced it through and through; Rykov dodged and thus escaped
7059,ARGUMENT,"death, but he was frightened; with a cry of ""Yagers! Rebellion! In God's"
7060,ARGUMENT,"name!"" he drew his sword, and, defending himself, he retreated to the"
7061,ARGUMENT,threshold.
7062,ARGUMENT,
7063,ARGUMENT,Then on the other side of the room many of the gentry poured in through
7064,ARGUMENT,"the windows with swords, Switch at their head. In the hall Plut and Rykov"
7065,ARGUMENT,behind him were calling the soldiers; already the three nearest the house
7066,ARGUMENT,were running to their aid; already three glittering bayonets were gliding
7067,ARGUMENT,"through the door, and behind them there were bent forward three black"
7068,ARGUMENT,"helmets. Maciek stood by the door with his switch raised on high, and,"
7069,ARGUMENT,"squeezing close to the wall, lay in wait for them as a cat for rats; then"
7070,ARGUMENT,"he struck a fearful blow. Perhaps he would have felled three heads, but"
7071,ARGUMENT,"the old man either had poor eyesight, or else he was too much wrought up;"
7072,ARGUMENT,"since, before they put forward their necks, he smote on their helmets, and"
7073,ARGUMENT,"stripped them off; the switch, falling, clinked on the bayonets.--The"
7074,ARGUMENT,"Muscovites started back, and Maciek drove them out to the yard."
7075,ARGUMENT,
7076,ARGUMENT,There the confusion was still worse. There the partisans of the Soplicas
7077,ARGUMENT,vied with each other in setting free the Dobrzynskis by tearing apart the
7078,ARGUMENT,"beams. Seeing this, the yagers seized their arms and made for them; a"
7079,ARGUMENT,sergeant rushed ahead and transfixed Podhajski with a bayonet; he wounded
7080,ARGUMENT,two others of the gentry and was shooting at a third; they fled: this was
7081,ARGUMENT,close to the log in which Baptist was fastened. He already had his arms
7082,ARGUMENT,"free and ready for fight; he rose, lifted his hand with its long fingers"
7083,ARGUMENT,and clenched his fist; and from above he gave the Russian such a blow on
7084,ARGUMENT,the back that he knocked his face and temples into the lock of his
7085,ARGUMENT,"carbine. The lock clicked, but the powder, moist with blood, did not"
7086,ARGUMENT,catch; the sergeant fell on his arms at the feet of Baptist. Baptist bent
7087,ARGUMENT,"down, seized the carbine by the barrel, and, brandishing it like his"
7088,ARGUMENT,"sprinkling-brush, lifted it aloft; he whirled it about and straightway"
7089,ARGUMENT,smote two privates on the shoulders and gave a corporal a blow on the
7090,ARGUMENT,"head; the rest, terrified, recoiled in dismay from the log: thus Sprinkler"
7091,ARGUMENT,sheltered the gentry with a moving roof.
7092,ARGUMENT,
7093,ARGUMENT,"Then they pulled apart the logs and cut the cords; the gentry, once free,"
7094,ARGUMENT,"descended upon the waggons of the Alms-Gatherer, and from them procured"
7095,ARGUMENT,"swords, sabres, cutlasses, scythes, and guns. Bucket found two"
7096,ARGUMENT,blunderbusses and a bag of bullets; he poured some of these into his own
7097,ARGUMENT,blunderbuss; the other gun he loaded in the same way and gave over to
7098,ARGUMENT,Buzzard.
7099,ARGUMENT,
7100,ARGUMENT,"More yagers arrived, fell into disorder, and knocked against one another;"
7101,ARGUMENT,the gentry in the tumult could not cut and slash; the yagers could not
7102,ARGUMENT,"shoot, for they were fighting hand to hand. Like tooth on tooth, steel on"
7103,ARGUMENT,steel clashed and snapped; bayonet broke on sabre and scythe on sword
7104,ARGUMENT,hilt; fist met fist and arm met arm.
7105,ARGUMENT,
7106,ARGUMENT,"But Rykov, with a part of the yagers, ran up to where the barn adjoined"
7107,ARGUMENT,the fence; there he made a stand and called to his soldiers that they
7108,ARGUMENT,"should stop so disorderly a fight, since, without having a chance to use"
7109,ARGUMENT,"their weapons, they were falling beneath the fists of the enemy. Angry"
7110,ARGUMENT,"that he himself could not fire, for in the press he could not distinguish"
7111,ARGUMENT,"Muscovites from Poles, he shouted, ""Fall in"" (which means form in line);"
7112,ARGUMENT,but his command could not be heard in the midst of the shouting.
7113,ARGUMENT,
7114,ARGUMENT,"Old Maciek, who was not good at hand to hand combat, retreated, clearing a"
7115,ARGUMENT,place before him to the right and to the left; now with the tip of his
7116,ARGUMENT,sabre he sheared a bayonet from a gun barrel as a wick from a candle; now
7117,ARGUMENT,with a slashing blow from the left he cut or stabbed. Thus the cautious
7118,ARGUMENT,Maciek retired to the open field.
7119,ARGUMENT,
7120,ARGUMENT,"But an old corporal, who was the instructor of the regiment, a great"
7121,ARGUMENT,"master of the bayonet, pressed upon him with the utmost obstinacy; he"
7122,ARGUMENT,"gathered himself together, bent down, and grasped his carbine with both"
7123,ARGUMENT,"hands, holding the right on the lock and the left at the middle of the"
7124,ARGUMENT,"barrel; he dodged and skipped, and at times crouched down; he let go with"
7125,ARGUMENT,"his left hand, and thrust forward the weapon with his right, like the"
7126,ARGUMENT,sting from the jaws of a serpent; and again he withdrew it and rested it
7127,ARGUMENT,on his knees; and thus dodging and jumping he pressed upon Maciek.
7128,ARGUMENT,
7129,ARGUMENT,"Old Maciek appreciated the skill of his adversary, and with his left hand"
7130,ARGUMENT,adjusted his spectacles on his nose; with his right he held the hilt of
7131,ARGUMENT,"his switch close to his breast, and withdrew, following the motions of the"
7132,ARGUMENT,corporal with his eyes; he himself tottered on his legs as though he were
7133,ARGUMENT,"drunk. The corporal pressed on the more quickly; sure of his triumph, and"
7134,ARGUMENT,"in order the more easily to reach his retiring foe, he arose and stretched"
7135,ARGUMENT,"forward his right arm at full length, pushing forward his carbine; he made"
7136,ARGUMENT,"such an effort in thrusting with his heavy weapon, that he even leaned"
7137,ARGUMENT,forward. Maciek shoved the hilt of his sword just under the spot where the
7138,ARGUMENT,"bayonet is set upon the gun barrel, and knocked up the weapon; then,"
7139,ARGUMENT,"suddenly lowering his switch, he wounded the Muscovite in the arm, and"
7140,ARGUMENT,"again, with a slash from the left, cut through his jaw. Thus fell the"
7141,ARGUMENT,"corporal, the finest fencer among the Muscovites, a cavalier of three"
7142,ARGUMENT,crosses and four medals.
7143,ARGUMENT,
7144,ARGUMENT,"Meanwhile, near the logs, the left wing of the gentry was already near"
7145,ARGUMENT,"victory. There fought Sprinkler, visible from afar, there Razor hovered"
7146,ARGUMENT,"around the Muscovites; the latter slashed at their waists, the former"
7147,ARGUMENT,pounded their heads. As a machine that German workmen have invented and
7148,ARGUMENT,"that is called a thrasher, but is at the same time a chopper--it has chains"
7149,ARGUMENT,"and knives, and cuts up the straw and thrashes the grain at the same"
7150,ARGUMENT,"time--so did Sprinkler and Razor work together, slaughtering their enemies,"
7151,ARGUMENT,one from above and the other from below.
7152,ARGUMENT,
7153,ARGUMENT,"But Sprinkler now abandoned sure victory and ran to the right wing, where"
7154,ARGUMENT,a new danger was threatening Maciek. Eager to avenge the death of the
7155,ARGUMENT,"corporal, an ensign was attacking him with a long spontoon--the spontoon is"
7156,ARGUMENT,"a combination of pike and axe, now discarded, and employed only in the"
7157,ARGUMENT,"fleet, but then it was used also in the infantry. The ensign, a young man,"
7158,ARGUMENT,ran nimbly back and forth; whenever his adversary beat the weapon to one
7159,ARGUMENT,"side, he retired; Maciek, not being able to drive off the young man, was"
7160,ARGUMENT,obliged merely to defend himself without inflicting wounds. Already the
7161,ARGUMENT,"ensign had given him a slight wound with the spear; already, raising the"
7162,ARGUMENT,"halberd aloft, he was collecting himself for a blow. Baptist was unable to"
7163,ARGUMENT,"reach him in time, but stopping half way, he whirled his weapon, and cast"
7164,ARGUMENT,"it under the feet of his enemy; he broke a bone, and the ensign"
7165,ARGUMENT,immediately dropped the spontoon from his hands. He staggered; Baptist
7166,ARGUMENT,"rushed on him, and after him a throng of gentry, and after the gentry the"
7167,ARGUMENT,"Muscovites from the left wing ran up in disorder, and the battle raged"
7168,ARGUMENT,around Sprinkler.
7169,ARGUMENT,
7170,ARGUMENT,"Baptist, who had lost his arms in defence of Maciek, almost paid for that"
7171,ARGUMENT,"service with his life; for two strong Muscovites fell on him from behind,"
7172,ARGUMENT,"and twisted four hands at once into his hair; bracing their feet, they"
7173,ARGUMENT,"pulled as on springy cables, hitched to the mast of a barge. In vain"
7174,ARGUMENT,Sprinkler struck out blindly behind him; he tottered--but suddenly he saw
7175,ARGUMENT,"that Gerwazy was fighting close by; he shouted, ""Jesus Maria! the"
7176,ARGUMENT,"penknife!"""
7177,ARGUMENT,
7178,ARGUMENT,"The Warden, hearing Baptist's cry, knew that he was in mortal terror; he"
7179,ARGUMENT,"turned back, and plunged the sharp steel blade between the head of Baptist"
7180,ARGUMENT,"and the hands of the Muscovites. They withdrew, uttering piercing cries,"
7181,ARGUMENT,"but one hand, more firmly entwined in the hair, remained hanging and"
7182,ARGUMENT,"spurted forth blood. Thus an eagle, when it buries one talon in a hare,"
7183,ARGUMENT,"catches with the other at a tree, in order to hold back the beast; but the"
7184,ARGUMENT,"hare, pulling, splits the eagle in two; the right talon remains on the"
7185,ARGUMENT,"tree in the forest; the left, covered with blood, the beast bears away to"
7186,ARGUMENT,the fields.
7187,ARGUMENT,
7188,ARGUMENT,"Sprinkler, free once more, cast his eyes about, stretched out his hands,"
7189,ARGUMENT,"sought for a weapon, shouted for a weapon; meanwhile he brandished his"
7190,ARGUMENT,"fists, standing his ground manfully, but keeping close to the side of"
7191,ARGUMENT,"Gerwazy, until he caught sight of his son Buzzard in the press. Buzzard"
7192,ARGUMENT,"with his right hand was aiming a blunderbuss, and with his left was"
7193,ARGUMENT,"pulling after him a great club, a fathom long, armed with flints and knobs"
7194,ARGUMENT,"and knots.163 (No one could have lifted it except Baptist.) Baptist, when"
7195,ARGUMENT,"he saw his darling weapon, his sprinkling-brush, seized it, kissed it,"
7196,ARGUMENT,"jumped into the air for joy, whirled it over his head and straightway"
7197,ARGUMENT,moistened it.
7198,ARGUMENT,
7199,ARGUMENT,"What deeds he then performed, what disasters he spread abroad, it were"
7200,ARGUMENT,"vain to sing, for none would believe the Muse: even so they did not"
7201,ARGUMENT,"believe the poor woman in Wilno, who, standing on the summit of the holy"
7202,ARGUMENT,"Ostra Gate, saw how Deyov, the Muscovite general, coming on with a"
7203,ARGUMENT,"regiment of Cossacks, was already opening the gate, and how a single"
7204,ARGUMENT,"burgher, named Czarnobacki, killed Deyov and routed a whole regiment of"
7205,ARGUMENT,Cossacks.164
7206,ARGUMENT,
7207,ARGUMENT,"Suffice it to say, that things came to pass as Rykov had foreseen; the"
7208,ARGUMENT,yagers in the crowd yielded to the power of their foes. Twenty-three
7209,ARGUMENT,"rolled slain on the ground, thirty and more lay groaning with frequent"
7210,ARGUMENT,"wounds, many fled and hid in the garden, the hops, or along the river;"
7211,ARGUMENT,some took refuge in the house under the protection of the women.
7212,ARGUMENT,
7213,ARGUMENT,"The victorious gentry ran with a cry of joy, some to the casks, others to"
7214,ARGUMENT,tear booty from the enemy; Robak alone did not share their exultation.
7215,ARGUMENT,Hitherto he had not fought himself (for the canons forbid a priest to take
7216,ARGUMENT,"part in combat), but as an experienced man he had been giving counsel, had"
7217,ARGUMENT,"run about the battlefield in all directions, and with his glance and his"
7218,ARGUMENT,arm had urged on and guided those who were fighting. And now he shouted
7219,ARGUMENT,"for them to assemble around him, attack Rykov, and complete the victory."
7220,ARGUMENT,Meanwhile by a messenger he informed Rykov that if he would lay down his
7221,ARGUMENT,"arms he would preserve his life; but, in case the surrender of arms were"
7222,ARGUMENT,"delayed, Robak gave orders to surround the remnant and cut them down."
7223,ARGUMENT,
7224,ARGUMENT,Captain Rykov was far from asking quarter. Gathering about him half a
7225,ARGUMENT,"battalion, he shouted, ""Ready!"" Immediately the line seized their carbines"
7226,ARGUMENT,"and the arms rattled; they had long since been loaded. He shouted, ""Aim!"""
7227,ARGUMENT,"and the barrels glittered in a long row. He shouted, ""Fire in turn!"" and"
7228,ARGUMENT,"one report followed another; one man shot, another loaded, a third"
7229,ARGUMENT,"clutched his musket. One could hear the whistling of bullets, the rattle"
7230,ARGUMENT,"of locks, the clink of ramrods; the whole line seemed to be a moving"
7231,ARGUMENT,"reptile, which moved a thousand glittering legs at the same time."
7232,ARGUMENT,
7233,ARGUMENT,"To be sure, the yagers were drunk with strong liquor; they aimed poorly"
7234,ARGUMENT,and missed their mark; few inflicted wounds and hardly a single one killed
7235,ARGUMENT,"his man: however, two of the Maciejs were already wounded, and one of the"
7236,ARGUMENT,Bartlomiejs had fallen. The gentry replied but sparingly from their few
7237,ARGUMENT,"guns, and were eager to attack the enemy with swords; but the older men"
7238,ARGUMENT,"restrained them: each moment the bullets whistled, struck, and forced the"
7239,ARGUMENT,gentry to retreat--soon they would have cleared the yard; already they
7240,ARGUMENT,began to ring on the windows of the house.
7241,ARGUMENT,
7242,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus, who by his uncle's orders had remained in the house to protect"
7243,ARGUMENT,"the women, hearing how the battle was becoming ever fiercer and fiercer,"
7244,ARGUMENT,"ran out, and after him rushed the Chamberlain, to whom Thomas had at last"
7245,ARGUMENT,brought his sabre; he hurriedly joined the gentry and took his place at
7246,ARGUMENT,"their head. He ran forward, raising his weapon, and the gentry moved after"
7247,ARGUMENT,"him. The yagers, letting them come near, poured upon them a hail of"
7248,ARGUMENT,"bullets; Isajewicz, Wilbik, and Razor fell wounded; then the gentry were"
7249,ARGUMENT,checked by Robak on one side and Maciej on the other. The gentry cooled in
7250,ARGUMENT,"their ardour, glanced about, and retired; the Muscovites saw this, and"
7251,ARGUMENT,"Captain Rykov planned to give the final blow, to drive the gentry from the"
7252,ARGUMENT,yard and seize the mansion.
7253,ARGUMENT,
7254,ARGUMENT,"""Form for the attack!"" he cried. ""Charge bayonets! Forward!"""
7255,ARGUMENT,
7256,ARGUMENT,"Immediately the line, levelling their gun barrels like poles, bent down"
7257,ARGUMENT,"their heads, moved on and quickened their step; in vain the gentry"
7258,ARGUMENT,endeavoured to check them from in front and shot from the side; the line
7259,ARGUMENT,"passed over half the yard without resistance. The Captain, pointing with"
7260,ARGUMENT,"his sword to the door of the mansion, shouted:--"
7261,ARGUMENT,
7262,ARGUMENT,"""Surrender, Judge, or I will order your house to be burned!"""
7263,ARGUMENT,
7264,ARGUMENT,"""Burn it,"" cried the Judge, ""and I will roast you in that fire!"""
7265,ARGUMENT,
7266,ARGUMENT,O mansion of Soplicowo! if thy white walls are still whole and glitter
7267,ARGUMENT,beneath the lindens; if a throng of the neighbouring gentry still sit at
7268,ARGUMENT,"the Judge's hospitable board, they surely often drink the health of"
7269,ARGUMENT,"Bucket, for without him Soplicowo would to-day be no more!"
7270,ARGUMENT,
7271,ARGUMENT,Bucket had so far given few proofs of valour. Though he was the first of
7272,ARGUMENT,"the gentry to be freed from the stocks, and though he had straightway"
7273,ARGUMENT,"found in the waggon his darling bucket, his favourite blunderbuss, and"
7274,ARGUMENT,"with it a pouch of bullets, he did not care to fight. He said that he did"
7275,ARGUMENT,"not trust himself when dry, and so he went to a cask of spirits standing"
7276,ARGUMENT,"near, and, using his hand as a spoon, dipped up a stream into his lips."
7277,ARGUMENT,Only when he had well warmed and strengthened himself did he adjust his
7278,ARGUMENT,"cap, take up his bucket from his knees, ram home a charge, sprinkle the"
7279,ARGUMENT,"pan, and gaze at the battlefield. He saw that a glittering wave of"
7280,ARGUMENT,"bayonets was smiting and dispersing the gentry, and he swam to meet that"
7281,ARGUMENT,"wave; he bent down and dived through the dense grass, across the centre of"
7282,ARGUMENT,"the yard, until he paused in ambush where the nettles were growing; with"
7283,ARGUMENT,gestures he summoned Buzzard.
7284,ARGUMENT,
7285,ARGUMENT,"Buzzard, who was on guard at the mansion, was standing with his"
7286,ARGUMENT,"blunderbuss by the threshold, for in that mansion dwelt his dear Zosia,"
7287,ARGUMENT,"whom he loved eternally (though she had scorned his courtship), and in"
7288,ARGUMENT,whose defence he was glad to perish.
7289,ARGUMENT,
7290,ARGUMENT,"The line of yagers was already entering the nettles, on the march, when"
7291,ARGUMENT,"Bucket touched the trigger, and from the broad mouth of his blunderbuss"
7292,ARGUMENT,let fly a dozen chopped bullets into the midst of the Muscovites; Buzzard
7293,ARGUMENT,"let fly another dozen, and the yagers fell into confusion. Dismayed by the"
7294,ARGUMENT,"ambuscade, the line folded back into a disorderly mass, retreated, and"
7295,ARGUMENT,abandoned the wounded; Baptist finished their slaughter.
7296,ARGUMENT,
7297,ARGUMENT,"The barn was already far off; fearing a long retreat, Rykov made for the"
7298,ARGUMENT,"garden fence, and there checked his fleeing company in its course. He drew"
7299,ARGUMENT,"them up, but changed their formation; instead of a line he made a"
7300,ARGUMENT,"triangle, with its point to the front and its base protected by the garden"
7301,ARGUMENT,"fence. He did well, for the cavalry descended on him from the castle."
7302,ARGUMENT,
7303,ARGUMENT,"The Count, who had been in the castle under the guard of the Muscovites,"
7304,ARGUMENT,"when his terrified guards had dispersed, had mounted his followers, and"
7305,ARGUMENT,"hearing shots, was leading his cavalry into the firing line, himself at"
7306,ARGUMENT,"their head, with his steel raised aloft. At once Rykov cried, ""Platoon"
7307,ARGUMENT,"fire!"" A fiery thread flew along over the locks, and from the black"
7308,ARGUMENT,levelled barrels three hundred bullets whistled. Three riders fell
7309,ARGUMENT,"wounded, and one lay dead. The Count's steed fell, and the Count with it;"
7310,ARGUMENT,"with a cry the Warden ran to the rescue, for he saw that the yagers had"
7311,ARGUMENT,aimed at the last of the Horeszkos--though in the female line. Robak was
7312,ARGUMENT,"nearer, and covered the Count with his body; he received the bullets in"
7313,ARGUMENT,"his stead, drew him from under his horse, and led him away; but the gentry"
7314,ARGUMENT,"he bade disperse, take better aim, spare vain shots, and hide behind the"
7315,ARGUMENT,"fences, the well, and the walls of the stable. The Count and his cavalry"
7316,ARGUMENT,had to wait a more fitting season.
7317,ARGUMENT,
7318,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus comprehended Robak's plans and carried them out splendidly,"
7319,ARGUMENT,"seeking cover behind the wooden well; and, since he was sober and was a"
7320,ARGUMENT,fine shot with his fowling piece (for he could hit a gold coin thrown in
7321,ARGUMENT,"the air), he did terrible execution on the Muscovites, picking out their"
7322,ARGUMENT,chiefs; with his first shot he at once killed the sergeant-major. Then
7323,ARGUMENT,"with his two barrels, one after the other, he mowed down two sergeants,"
7324,ARGUMENT,"aiming now at the gold lace, now at the middle of the triangle, where"
7325,ARGUMENT,"stood the staff. Thereupon Rykov grew angry and chafed, he stamped his"
7326,ARGUMENT,feet and bit the hilt of his sword.
7327,ARGUMENT,
7328,ARGUMENT,"""Major Plut,"" he cried, ""what will come of this? Soon not one of us will"
7329,ARGUMENT,"be left here to give orders!"""
7330,ARGUMENT,
7331,ARGUMENT,So Plut shouted at Thaddeus in great wrath:--
7332,ARGUMENT,
7333,ARGUMENT,"""Shame on you, you Pole, for hiding behind a plank shelter; don't be a"
7334,ARGUMENT,"coward, come out into the open and fight honourably, as a soldier should."""
7335,ARGUMENT,
7336,ARGUMENT,To this Thaddeus replied:--
7337,ARGUMENT,
7338,ARGUMENT,"""Major, if you are so bold a knight, why do you hide behind a company of"
7339,ARGUMENT,yagers? I am not afraid of you--come out from behind the fence; you have
7340,ARGUMENT,"had your face slapped, but still I am ready to fight with you! Why all"
7341,ARGUMENT,this bloodshed? The quarrel was between us two; so let the pistol or the
7342,ARGUMENT,"sword settle it. I give you your choice of weapons, from a cannon to a"
7343,ARGUMENT,"pin. Otherwise, I will shoot you and your men like wolves in a cave."""
7344,ARGUMENT,
7345,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he shot, and aimed so well that he hit the lieutenant by"
7346,ARGUMENT,Rykov's side.
7347,ARGUMENT,
7348,ARGUMENT,"""Major,"" whispered Rykov, ""go out and fight a duel with him, and take"
7349,ARGUMENT,vengeance on him for what he did some time ago. If anybody else kills that
7350,ARGUMENT,"young gentleman, then, Major, you see that you will not wash off your"
7351,ARGUMENT,disgrace. You must coax out that gentleman into the field; if you can't
7352,ARGUMENT,"kill him with a carbine, you may with a sword. Old Suvorov used to say,"
7353,ARGUMENT,"'Rifles are trifles, but hand arms are grand arms.' Go out into the field,"
7354,ARGUMENT,"Major, for he is shooting at us; look, he is aiming now."""
7355,ARGUMENT,
7356,ARGUMENT,"""Rykov, my dear friend,"" replied the Major, ""you are a fine boy with a"
7357,ARGUMENT,"sword; go out yourself, brother Rykov--or, I tell you what, we will send"
7358,ARGUMENT,"one of our lieutenants. I, the Major, I cannot desert the soldiers; to me"
7359,ARGUMENT,"belongs the command of the battalion."""
7360,ARGUMENT,
7361,ARGUMENT,"Rykov, hearing this, lifted his sword and went out boldly; he ordered the"
7362,ARGUMENT,firing to cease and waved a white handkerchief. He asked Thaddeus what
7363,ARGUMENT,"weapon he preferred; after discussion, they agreed on swords. Thaddeus had"
7364,ARGUMENT,"no weapon; while they were looking for swords, the Count rushed out armed"
7365,ARGUMENT,and interrupted the negotiations.
7366,ARGUMENT,
7367,ARGUMENT,"""Pan Soplica,"" he shouted. ""begging your pardon, you challenged the Major!"
7368,ARGUMENT,I have a grudge of longer standing against the Captain; he has broken into
7369,ARGUMENT,"my castle""--""Please say _our_ castle,"" interrupted Protazy--""at the head of"
7370,ARGUMENT,"a band of robbers,"" the Count concluded. ""He--I recognised Rykov--tied up my"
7371,ARGUMENT,jockeys; I will punish him as I punished the brigands beneath the crag
7372,ARGUMENT,"that the Sicilians call Birbante-Rocca."""
7373,ARGUMENT,
7374,ARGUMENT,"All became silent, and the firing ceased; the armies gazed eagerly at the"
7375,ARGUMENT,"meeting of their leaders. The Count and Rykov advanced, standing sidewise,"
7376,ARGUMENT,threatening each other with the right hand and the right eye; then with
7377,ARGUMENT,their left hands they uncovered their heads and bowed courteously--it is
7378,ARGUMENT,"the custom of men of honour, before proceeding to murder, first to"
7379,ARGUMENT,exchange greetings. Their swords were already crossed and had begun to
7380,ARGUMENT,"clash. The knights, each lifting one foot, bent their right knees, and"
7381,ARGUMENT,jumped forward and back by turns.
7382,ARGUMENT,
7383,ARGUMENT,"But Plut, seeing Thaddeus in front of his line, had a quiet consultation"
7384,ARGUMENT,"with Corporal Gont, who passed for the best shot in the company."
7385,ARGUMENT,
7386,ARGUMENT,"""Gont,"" said the Major, ""you see that rascal there; if you will put a"
7387,ARGUMENT,bullet into him right under the fifth rib I'll give you four silver
7388,ARGUMENT,"rubles."""
7389,ARGUMENT,
7390,ARGUMENT,Gont cocked his carbine and bent over the lock; his faithful comrades
7391,ARGUMENT,"sheltered him with their cloaks. He aimed, not at the rib, but at the head"
7392,ARGUMENT,"of Thaddeus; he shot and hit the centre of his hat, close to his mark."
7393,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus whirled about, then Sprinkler rushed on Rykov, and after him the"
7394,ARGUMENT,"gentry, crying ""Treason!"" Though Thaddeus shielded him, Rykov barely"
7395,ARGUMENT,managed to retreat and find refuge in the centre of his ranks.
7396,ARGUMENT,
7397,ARGUMENT,Again the Dobrzynskis and the other Lithuanians vied with one another in
7398,ARGUMENT,"pressing forward, and, despite the former disagreements of the two"
7399,ARGUMENT,"factions, they fought like brothers, each urging on his comrade. The"
7400,ARGUMENT,"Dobrzynskis, seeing how a Podhajski was prancing before the line of yagers"
7401,ARGUMENT,"and slashing them with his scythe, shouted joyfully: ""Long live the"
7402,ARGUMENT,"Podhajskis! Forward, brother Lithuanians! hurrah! hurrah for Lithuania!"""
7403,ARGUMENT,"And the Skolubas, seeing how the valiant Razor, despite his wound, was"
7404,ARGUMENT,"dashing on with his sabre raised aloft, cried: ""Hurrah for the Macieks!"
7405,ARGUMENT,"long live the Masovians!"" Inspiring one another with courage, they ran"
7406,ARGUMENT,upon the Muscovites; in vain Robak and Maciek tried to restrain them.
7407,ARGUMENT,
7408,ARGUMENT,"While they were thus smiting the company of yagers from the front, the"
7409,ARGUMENT,Seneschal abandoned the battlefield and went into the garden. By his side
7410,ARGUMENT,"strode the cautious Protazy, to whom the Seneschal was quietly issuing"
7411,ARGUMENT,orders.
7412,ARGUMENT,
7413,ARGUMENT,"In the garden, close to the fence against which Rykov had supported his"
7414,ARGUMENT,"triangle, stood a large old cheese house, built of lattice work made of"
7415,ARGUMENT,"beams nailed across one another, like a cage. In it there shone many"
7416,ARGUMENT,"scores of white cheeses; around them bunches of sage, bennet, cardoon, and"
7417,ARGUMENT,"wild thyme hung drying, the entire herb apothecary shop of the Seneschal's"
7418,ARGUMENT,"daughter. The cheese house was some twenty feet square, but it rested only"
7419,ARGUMENT,"on a single great pillar, like a stork's nest. The old oaken pillar"
7420,ARGUMENT,"slanted, for it was already half decayed, and threatened to fall. The"
7421,ARGUMENT,"Judge had often been advised to destroy the age-worn structure, but he"
7422,ARGUMENT,"always said that he preferred to repair it rather than to destroy it, or"
7423,ARGUMENT,even to rebuild it. He kept postponing the task to a more convenient
7424,ARGUMENT,"season, and in the meantime bade put two props under the pillar. The"
7425,ARGUMENT,"structure, thus strengthened, but still not firm, looked over the fence at"
7426,ARGUMENT,Rykov's triangle.
7427,ARGUMENT,
7428,ARGUMENT,"Toward this cheese house the Seneschal and the Apparitor walked silently,"
7429,ARGUMENT,"each armed with an immense pole, as with a pike; after them the"
7430,ARGUMENT,"housekeeper stole through the hemp, with the scullion, a small but very"
7431,ARGUMENT,"strong lad. Arriving at the spot, they rested their poles against the"
7432,ARGUMENT,"rotted top of the pillar, and, clinging to the ends, pushed with all their"
7433,ARGUMENT,"might, as when boatmen with long poles push from the bank into the deep"
7434,ARGUMENT,water a barge that has grounded on a reef.
7435,ARGUMENT,
7436,ARGUMENT,"The pillar snapped, and the cheese house tottered and fell with its load"
7437,ARGUMENT,"of beams and cheeses on the triangle of Muscovites; it crushed, wounded,"
7438,ARGUMENT,"and killed; where the ranks had just now been standing lay beams, corpses,"
7439,ARGUMENT,"and cheeses white as snow, stained with blood and brains. The triangle was"
7440,ARGUMENT,"shattered into bits, and now in the centre of it the sprinkling-brush"
7441,ARGUMENT,"thundered, the razor flashed, and the switch slashed; from the mansion"
7442,ARGUMENT,"rushed a throng of gentry, and the Count from the yard gate sent his"
7443,ARGUMENT,cavalry against the scattered fugitives.
7444,ARGUMENT,
7445,ARGUMENT,"Now, only eight yagers with a sergeant at their head still defended"
7446,ARGUMENT,"themselves; the Warden ran against them, but they boldly stood their"
7447,ARGUMENT,ground and aimed nine musket barrels straight at the brow of the Warden;
7448,ARGUMENT,"he flew to meet the shot, brandishing the blade of his penknife. The Monk"
7449,ARGUMENT,"saw it, and ran across Gerwazy's path; he fell and tripped Gerwazy. They"
7450,ARGUMENT,fell at the very moment when the platoon fired; hardly had the bullets
7451,ARGUMENT,"whistled over him, when Gerwazy rose, and jumped up into the smoke. He"
7452,ARGUMENT,straightway sheared off the heads of two yagers; the rest fled in
7453,ARGUMENT,"confusion, the Warden chased and slashed them. They ran across the yard,"
7454,ARGUMENT,"Gerwazy on their track; they rushed into the door of a shed standing open,"
7455,ARGUMENT,"and Gerwazy entered the shed at their heels. He vanished in the darkness,"
7456,ARGUMENT,"but did not quit fighting, for through the door could be heard groans,"
7457,ARGUMENT,"yells, and frequent blows. Soon all became silent; Gerwazy came out alone,"
7458,ARGUMENT,with a bloody sword.
7459,ARGUMENT,
7460,ARGUMENT,"Now the gentry had won the field; they pursued, slashed, and stabbed the"
7461,ARGUMENT,"dispersed yagers. Rykov alone remained, and cried that he would not lay"
7462,ARGUMENT,"down his arms; he was still fighting, when the Chamberlain went up to him,"
7463,ARGUMENT,"and, raising his sabre, said in an impressive tone:--"
7464,ARGUMENT,
7465,ARGUMENT,"""Captain, you will not soil your honour by accepting quarter; unhappy, but"
7466,ARGUMENT,"valiant knight, you have given ample proof of your daring: now abandon"
7467,ARGUMENT,"hopeless resistance; lay down your arms, before we disarm you with our"
7468,ARGUMENT,"sabres. You will preserve life and honour; you are my prisoner."""
7469,ARGUMENT,
7470,ARGUMENT,"Rykov, overcome by the dignity of the Chamberlain, complied, and gave over"
7471,ARGUMENT,"to him his naked sword, bloody to the hilt, saying:--"
7472,ARGUMENT,
7473,ARGUMENT,"""Brother Poles, woe is me that I did not have even a single cannon!"
7474,ARGUMENT,"Suvorov said well: 'Remember, comrade Rykov, never to attack the Poles"
7475,ARGUMENT,"without cannon!' Well! The yagers were drunk, the Major let them drink!"
7476,ARGUMENT,"Ah, Major Plut! He has played sad tricks to-day. He will answer for them"
7477,ARGUMENT,"to the Tsar, for he was in command. I will be your friend, Chamberlain."
7478,ARGUMENT,"There is a Russian proverb, Chamberlain, 'Who loves well, shoves well!'"
7479,ARGUMENT,You are good at a bottle and good at a battle--but stop playing your rough
7480,ARGUMENT,"jokes on my yagers."""
7481,ARGUMENT,
7482,ARGUMENT,"Hearing this, the Chamberlain raised his sabre and, through the Apparitor,"
7483,ARGUMENT,"proclaimed a general pardon; he gave orders to tend the wounded, to clear"

7502,ARGUMENT,
7503,ARGUMENT,
7504,ARGUMENT,"The morning clouds, dispersed for a moment, like black birds, kept"
7505,ARGUMENT,gathering and flying towards the summit of the heavens; hardly had the sun
7506,ARGUMENT,declined from noon when their flock had covered half the sky with an
7507,ARGUMENT,"immense mantle; the wind drove it on faster and faster, the cloud grew"
7508,ARGUMENT,"more and more dense and hung lower and lower: finally, half torn away from"
7509,ARGUMENT,"the sky on one side, bending towards the earth, and spread out far and"
7510,ARGUMENT,"wide like a great sail, it gathered into itself all the winds and flew"
7511,ARGUMENT,over the sky from the south to the west.
7512,ARGUMENT,
7513,ARGUMENT,"There was an instant of calm, and the air became dull and silent, as if"
7514,ARGUMENT,"dumb with terror. And the fields of grain, which just before, bowing to"
7515,ARGUMENT,"the earth and again shaking their golden ears on high, had tossed like"
7516,ARGUMENT,"waves, now stood motionless and gazed at the sky with bristling stalks."
7517,ARGUMENT,"And the green willows and poplars by the roadside, which, like mourners by"
7518,ARGUMENT,"an open grave, had been bowing their heads to the earth, and brandishing"
7519,ARGUMENT,"their long arms, with their silver tresses spread out on the winds, now"
7520,ARGUMENT,"stood as if dead, with an expression of dumb grief like the statue of"
7521,ARGUMENT,Niobe on Sipylos. Only the trembling aspen shook its grey leaves.
7522,ARGUMENT,
7523,ARGUMENT,"The cattle, usually loath to return homeward, now rushed together, and,"
7524,ARGUMENT,"without waiting for their keepers, deserted their pasturage and ran"
7525,ARGUMENT,towards the barn. The bull dug up the ground with his hoof and ploughed it
7526,ARGUMENT,"with his horns, frightening all the herd with his ill-omened bellowing;"
7527,ARGUMENT,"the cow kept raising her large eyes to the sky, opening her mouth in"
7528,ARGUMENT,"wonder, and lowing deeply. But the boar lagged behind, fretting and"
7529,ARGUMENT,"gnashing his teeth, and stole sheaves of grain and seized them for his"
7530,ARGUMENT,stores.
7531,ARGUMENT,
7532,ARGUMENT,"The birds hid in the woods, in the thatched roofs, in the depths of the"
7533,ARGUMENT,"grass; the ravens, surrounding the ponds in flocks, walked to and fro with"
7534,ARGUMENT,"measured steps; they turned their black eyes on the black clouds, and,"
7535,ARGUMENT,"protruding their tongues from their broad, dry throats and spreading out"
7536,ARGUMENT,"their wings, they awaited their bath. Yet even they, foreseeing too fierce"
7537,ARGUMENT,"a storm, already were making for the wood, like a rising cloud. The last"
7538,ARGUMENT,"of the birds, the swallow, made bold by its fleetness of wing, pierced the"
7539,ARGUMENT,"cloud like an arrow, and finally dropped from it like a bullet."
7540,ARGUMENT,
7541,ARGUMENT,Just at that moment the gentry had finished their terrible combat with the
7542,ARGUMENT,"Muscovites, and one and all were seeking shelter in the houses and"
7543,ARGUMENT,"stables, deserting the battlefield, where soon the elements joined in"
7544,ARGUMENT,combat.
7545,ARGUMENT,
7546,ARGUMENT,"To the west, the earth, still gilded by the sun, shone with a gloomy,"
7547,ARGUMENT,"yellowish-red tint; already the cloud, spreading out its shadows like a"
7548,ARGUMENT,"net, was catching the remnants of the light and flying after the sun as if"
7549,ARGUMENT,it wished to seize upon it before it set. Blasts of wind whistled sharply
7550,ARGUMENT,"below; they rushed by, one after another, bringing drops of rain, large,"
7551,ARGUMENT,"clear, and rounded as hailstones."
7552,ARGUMENT,
7553,ARGUMENT,"Suddenly the winds grappled, split asunder, struggled, whirled about, and"
7554,ARGUMENT,"in whistling columns circled over the ponds, stirring the waters in the"
7555,ARGUMENT,ponds to their depths; they fell upon the meadows and whistled through the
7556,ARGUMENT,"willows and the grass. The willow branches snapped, the swaths of grass"
7557,ARGUMENT,"were borne on the wind like hair torn out by handfuls, mixed with ringlets"
7558,ARGUMENT,"from the sheaves. The winds howled; they fell upon the field, wallowed,"
7559,ARGUMENT,"dug into the earth, snatched up clods, and made an opening for a third"
7560,ARGUMENT,"wind, which tore itself from the field like a pillar of black earth, and"
7561,ARGUMENT,"rose and whirled like a moving pyramid, boring into the ground with its"
7562,ARGUMENT,brow and from its feet sprinkling sand in the eyes of the stars; it
7563,ARGUMENT,"broadened at every step and opened out at the summit, and with its immense"
7564,ARGUMENT,trumpet it proclaimed the storm. At last with all this chaos of water and
7565,ARGUMENT,"dust, of straw, leaves, branches, and torn-up sod, the winds smote on the"
7566,ARGUMENT,forest and roared through the depths of the thicket like bears.
7567,ARGUMENT,
7568,ARGUMENT,"And now the rain poured as from a sieve, in great, swift drops; then the"
7569,ARGUMENT,thunder roared and the drops united; now like straight strings they bound
7570,ARGUMENT,"the sky to the earth with long tresses, now, as from buckets, they poured"
7571,ARGUMENT,down in great masses. Now the sky and the earth were quite hidden; the
7572,ARGUMENT,"night, and the storm more black than night, shrouded them. At times the"
7573,ARGUMENT,"horizon cracked from side to side, and the angel of the storm, like an"
7574,ARGUMENT,"immense sun, showed his glittering face; and again, wrapped in a shroud,"
7575,ARGUMENT,he fled into the sky and the doors of the clouds crashed together with a
7576,ARGUMENT,"thunder-clap. Again the gale increased and the driving rain, and the"
7577,ARGUMENT,"dense, thick, almost impenetrable darkness. Again the drops murmured more"
7578,ARGUMENT,"gently, the thunder for a moment subsided; again it awoke and roared and"
7579,ARGUMENT,water once more gushed forth. At last all became calm; one heard only the
7580,ARGUMENT,soughing of the trees around the house and the patter of the rain.
7581,ARGUMENT,
7582,ARGUMENT,"On a day such as had just passed the wildest storm was to be desired,"
7583,ARGUMENT,"since the tempest, which covered the battlefield with darkness, drenched"
7584,ARGUMENT,"the roads and destroyed the bridges over the river, and made of the farm"
7585,ARGUMENT,an inaccessible fortress. So of what had been done in the Soplicas' camp
7586,ARGUMENT,the news could not spread abroad on that day--and it was precisely upon
7587,ARGUMENT,secrecy that the fate of the gentry depended.
7588,ARGUMENT,
7589,ARGUMENT,In the Judge's room an important consultation was in progress. The
7590,ARGUMENT,"Bernardine lay on the bed, exhausted, pale, and blood-stained, but wholly"
7591,ARGUMENT,sound in his mind; he issued orders and the Judge carried them out to the
7592,ARGUMENT,"letter. He invited the Chamberlain to join them, summoned the Warden, had"
7593,ARGUMENT,"Rykov brought in, and then shut the door. For a whole hour the secret"
7594,ARGUMENT,"conversation continued, until Captain Rykov, throwing on the table a heavy"
7595,ARGUMENT,"purse of ducats, interrupted it with these words:--"
7596,ARGUMENT,
7597,ARGUMENT,"""My Polish friends, it is common talk among you that every Muscovite is a"
7598,ARGUMENT,"rascal: now tell any one who asks, that you have found a Muscovite who was"
7599,ARGUMENT,"named Nikita Nikitich Rykov, a captain in the army, and who wore eight"
7600,ARGUMENT,medals and three crosses--I beg you remember that. This medal was for
7601,ARGUMENT,"Ochakov,166 this for Izmailov,167 this for the battle at Novi,168 this for"
7602,ARGUMENT,Preisizh-Ilov;169 that for Korsakov's famous retreat from Zurich.170 And
7603,ARGUMENT,"tell them that he received also a sword for valour, and likewise three"
7604,ARGUMENT,"expressions of approval from the field-marshal, two compliments from the"
7605,ARGUMENT,"Emperor, and four honourable mentions, all in writing."""
7606,ARGUMENT,
7607,ARGUMENT,"""But, but, captain,"" interrupted Robak, ""what is going to happen to _us_"
7608,ARGUMENT,if you will not come to terms? You know that you have given your word to
7609,ARGUMENT,"hush up this matter."""
7610,ARGUMENT,
7611,ARGUMENT,"""Certainly, and I will give my word again,"" said Rykov; ""there you have"
7612,ARGUMENT,"it! Why should I want to ruin you? I am an honest man; I like you Poles,"
7613,ARGUMENT,"for you are jolly fellows, good at a bottle, and likewise bold fellows,"
7614,ARGUMENT,good at a battle. We have a Russian saying: 'Who rides in the cart often
7615,ARGUMENT,falls under the cart; who is in front to-day may be behind to-morrow;
7616,ARGUMENT,to-day you beat and to-morrow they beat you.' Why be angry over it? Such
7617,ARGUMENT,is the way of life among us soldiers. Why should a man be so mean as to be
7618,ARGUMENT,"angry over a defeat! The fight at Ochakov was bloody, at Zurich they"
7619,ARGUMENT,"crushed our infantry, at Austerlitz I lost my whole company; but before"
7620,ARGUMENT,"that, when I was a sergeant, your Kosciuszko cut up my platoon with"
7621,ARGUMENT,"scythes at Raclawice.171 What did it matter? Later on, at Maciejowice172 I"
7622,ARGUMENT,killed with my own bayonet two brave gentlemen; one of them was
7623,ARGUMENT,"Mokronowski, who was advancing with a scythe in front of his troops and"
7624,ARGUMENT,"who had cut off the hand of a cannoneer, with the match in it. Ah, you"
7625,ARGUMENT,"Poles! The Fatherland! I feel it all, I, Rykov. The Tsar gives the"
7626,ARGUMENT,order--but I am sorry for you. What have we against the Poles? Let Moscow
7627,ARGUMENT,be for the Muscovites and Poland for the Poles! But what is to be done?
7628,ARGUMENT,"The Tsar will not permit it!"""
7629,ARGUMENT,
7630,ARGUMENT,The Judge replied to him:--
7631,ARGUMENT,
7632,ARGUMENT,"""Captain, that you are an honest man all in this district know, where you"
7633,ARGUMENT,"have been quartered for many years. Good friend, be not angry at this"
7634,ARGUMENT,gift; we did not wish to offend you. These ducats we have ventured to
7635,ARGUMENT,"collect because we know that you are not a rich man."""
7636,ARGUMENT,
7637,ARGUMENT,"""O my yagers!"" cried Rykov, ""the whole company cut to pieces! My company!"
7638,ARGUMENT,And all the fault of that Plut! He was the chief in command; he will have
7639,ARGUMENT,"to answer for it to the Tsar. But, gentlemen, take those pennies for"
7640,ARGUMENT,"yourselves; I have my captain's pay, such as it is--enough for my punch and"
7641,ARGUMENT,"for a pipe of tobacco. But I like you, gentlemen, because with you I eat,"
7642,ARGUMENT,"drink, and am merry--with you I can have a friendly talk, and thus my life"
7643,ARGUMENT,"passes. So I will protect you, and when the inquiry comes up, on my word"
7644,ARGUMENT,"of honour, I will testify in your favour. We will say that we came here on"
7645,ARGUMENT,"a visit, had a drink, danced, got a trifle tipsy, and that Plut"
7646,ARGUMENT,"accidentally gave the word to fire; then came a battle, and the battalion"
7647,ARGUMENT,somehow melted away. If you gentlemen will only grease the inquiry with
7648,ARGUMENT,gold it will come out all right. But now I will repeat to you what I have
7649,ARGUMENT,"already said to that gentleman with the long sword, that Plut is the first"
7650,ARGUMENT,"in command, I the second; Plut is still alive, and he may play you a trick"
7651,ARGUMENT,"that will be your ruin, for he is a cunning specimen--you need to stuff his"
7652,ARGUMENT,"mouth with bank notes. Well, my friend, you with the long sword, have you"
7653,ARGUMENT,"called on Plut already? Have you had a talk with him?"""
7654,ARGUMENT,
7655,ARGUMENT,Gerwazy looked around and stroked his bald pate; he made a careless motion
7656,ARGUMENT,of his hand as if to signify that he had already arranged the whole
7657,ARGUMENT,matter. But Rykov persisted:--
7658,ARGUMENT,
7659,ARGUMENT,"""Well, will Plut keep quiet? Has he given his word to do so?"""
7660,ARGUMENT,
7661,ARGUMENT,"The Warden, vexed that Rykov should torment him with questions, solemnly"
7662,ARGUMENT,"bent down his thumb to the ground, and then, with a wave of the hand, as"
7663,ARGUMENT,"if to cut short further discourse, he said:--"
7664,ARGUMENT,
7665,ARGUMENT,"""I swear by my penknife that Plut will not betray us! He will talk no more"
7666,ARGUMENT,"with any one!"""
7667,ARGUMENT,
7668,ARGUMENT,"Then he let his hands fall and cracked his fingers, as if he were shaking"
7669,ARGUMENT,the whole mystery out of his hands.
7670,ARGUMENT,
7671,ARGUMENT,This dark gesture the hearers understood; they began to gaze in amazement
7672,ARGUMENT,"at one another, each trying to guess his neighbour's thoughts, and the"
7673,ARGUMENT,gloomy silence lasted for several minutes. At last Rykov said:--
7674,ARGUMENT,
7675,ARGUMENT,"""The wolf was a robber, and robbers have caught him!"""
7676,ARGUMENT,
7677,ARGUMENT,"""_Requiescat in pace_,"" added the Chamberlain."
7678,ARGUMENT,
7679,ARGUMENT,"""In this was the finger of God!"" said the Judge. ""But I am not guilty of"
7680,ARGUMENT,"this blood; I did not know of this."""
7681,ARGUMENT,
7682,ARGUMENT,"The Monk rose on the pillows and sat up with gloomy mien. At last he said,"
7683,ARGUMENT,looking sharply at the Warden:--
7684,ARGUMENT,
7685,ARGUMENT,"""It is a great sin to slay an unarmed captive! Christ forbids us to take"
7686,ARGUMENT,"vengeance even on our enemies! Ah! Warden, you will answer heavily for"
7687,ARGUMENT,this to God. There is but one ground of pardon--if the deed was done not
7688,ARGUMENT,"from stupid vengeance but _pro publico bono_."""
7689,ARGUMENT,
7690,ARGUMENT,"The Warden made a motion with his head and with his outstretched hand,"
7691,ARGUMENT,"and, blinking, repeated, ""_Pro publico bono_."""
7692,ARGUMENT,
7693,ARGUMENT,There was no more talk of Major Plut. Next day they sought vainly for him
7694,ARGUMENT,"in the yard, and vainly offered a reward for his body: the Major had"
7695,ARGUMENT,"perished without leaving a trace behind, as though he had fallen into the"
7696,ARGUMENT,"water; as to what had become of him there were various rumours, but no one"
7697,ARGUMENT,"knew with certainty, either then or later. In vain they tormented the"
7698,ARGUMENT,"Warden with questions; he said nothing but these words, ""_Pro publico"
7699,ARGUMENT,"bono_.""  The Seneschal was in the secret, but, bound by his word of"
7700,ARGUMENT,"honour, the old man kept silent as if under a spell."
7701,ARGUMENT,
7702,ARGUMENT,"After the conclusion of the agreement, Rykov left the room and Robak had"
7703,ARGUMENT,"the warrior gentry called in, to whom the Chamberlain gravely discoursed"
7704,ARGUMENT,as follows:--
7705,ARGUMENT,
7706,ARGUMENT,"""Brothers, to-day God has favoured our arms, but I must confess to you in"
7707,ARGUMENT,plain terms that evil results will follow these untimely battles. We have
7708,ARGUMENT,"erred, and each one of us here is to some degree at fault: the Monk Robak,"
7709,ARGUMENT,"for spreading tidings too zealously; the Warden and the gentry, for"
7710,ARGUMENT,completely misunderstanding them. The war with Russia will not begin for
7711,ARGUMENT,"some time; meanwhile, those who took the most active part in the battle"
7712,ARGUMENT,"cannot without danger remain in Lithuania. So, gentlemen, you must flee to"
7713,ARGUMENT,"the Grand Duchy of Warsaw; to be specific: Maciej, called Baptist,"
7714,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus, Bucket, and Razor must depart over the Niemen, where the hosts"
7715,ARGUMENT,of our nation await them. We will throw the whole blame on you who are
7716,ARGUMENT,"gone, and on Plut, and thus we shall save the rest of your kindred. I bid"
7717,ARGUMENT,"you farewell, but not for long; there are sure hopes that in spring the"
7718,ARGUMENT,"dawn of freedom will arise for us, and Lithuania, who now bids you"
7719,ARGUMENT,"farewell as wanderers, will soon behold you again as her victorious"
7720,ARGUMENT,"deliverers. The Judge is preparing everything needful for the journey,"
7721,ARGUMENT,"and, so far as I am able, I will aid you with money."""
7722,ARGUMENT,
7723,ARGUMENT,The gentry felt that the Chamberlain counselled wisely. It is well known
7724,ARGUMENT,"that whoever has once quarrelled with the Russian Tsar, can never conclude"
7725,ARGUMENT,"a lasting peace with him on this earth, and must either fight or rot in"
7726,ARGUMENT,"Siberia. So, saying nothing, they looked gloomily at one another and"
7727,ARGUMENT,sighed; in token of agreement they nodded their heads.
7728,ARGUMENT,
7729,ARGUMENT,"The Pole, though famous among the nations because he loves his native land"
7730,ARGUMENT,"more than life, is nevertheless always prepared to abandon it, and to"
7731,ARGUMENT,"travel to the ends of the earth, to live long years in poverty and"
7732,ARGUMENT,"contempt, struggling with men and with fate--so long as amid the storm"
7733,ARGUMENT,"there shines upon him this hope, that he is serving the Fatherland."
7734,ARGUMENT,
7735,ARGUMENT,"They declared that they were ready to depart at once. However, this plan"
7736,ARGUMENT,"did not meet with Pan Buchmann's approval: Buchmann, prudent man that he"
7737,ARGUMENT,"was, had not meddled in the battle, but as soon as he heard that they were"
7738,ARGUMENT,"having a consultation, he hastened to put in his word; he thought the"
7739,ARGUMENT,"project good, but wanted to alter it, to develop it with more precision,"
7740,ARGUMENT,"to explain it more clearly, and, first of all, legally to appoint a"
7741,ARGUMENT,"commission, which should consider the aims of the emigration, the means"
7742,ARGUMENT,"and methods, and likewise various other matters. Unfortunately the"
7743,ARGUMENT,shortness of the time prevented them from adopting Buchmann's advice. The
7744,ARGUMENT,gentry took a hasty farewell and at once started on their journey.
7745,ARGUMENT,
7746,ARGUMENT,But the Judge retained Thaddeus in the room and said to the Monk:--
7747,ARGUMENT,
7748,ARGUMENT,"""It is time for me to tell you what I learned with certainty only"
7749,ARGUMENT,"yesterday, that our Thaddeus is sincerely in love with Zosia; let him ask"
7750,ARGUMENT,"her hand before his departure! I have spoken with Telimena, and she no"
7751,ARGUMENT,longer opposes the match; Zosia also agrees to the wishes of her
7752,ARGUMENT,"guardians. If we cannot to-day make the pair happy by marriage, then at"
7753,ARGUMENT,"least, brother, we may betroth them before his departure; for the heart of"
7754,ARGUMENT,"a young traveller, as you know well, is exposed to various temptations."
7755,ARGUMENT,"And yet, when a young man glances at his ring and calls to mind that he is"
7756,ARGUMENT,"already a husband, at once the fever of temptations in a foreign land"
7757,ARGUMENT,"subsides. Believe me, a wedding ring has great force."
7758,ARGUMENT,
7759,ARGUMENT,"""I myself, thirty years ago, had a great passion for Panna Marta, whose"
7760,ARGUMENT,"heart I won; we were betrothed, but God did not bless that union; he left"
7761,ARGUMENT,"me alone on earth, taking to his glory the fair daughter of my friend the"
7762,ARGUMENT,Seneschal Hreczecha. There was left to me only the memory of her virtues
7763,ARGUMENT,"and her charms, and this golden wedding ring. Whenever I have looked upon"
7764,ARGUMENT,"it, the hapless girl has always appeared before my eyes; and thus, by the"
7765,ARGUMENT,"grace of God, I have preserved till now my plighted faith, and, without"
7766,ARGUMENT,"ever having been a husband, I am now an old widower, though the Seneschal"
7767,ARGUMENT,"has another daughter, very fair and very like my beloved Marta:"""
7768,ARGUMENT,
7769,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he gazed tenderly at the ring, and wiped the tears from his"
7770,ARGUMENT,eyes with the back of his hand.
7771,ARGUMENT,
7772,ARGUMENT,"""Brother, what think you?"" he concluded. ""Shall we betroth them? He loves"
7773,ARGUMENT,"her, and I have the consent of the aunt and of the girl."""
7774,ARGUMENT,
7775,ARGUMENT,"But Thaddeus, stepping quickly up to him, said eagerly:--"
7776,ARGUMENT,
7777,ARGUMENT,"""How can I thank you enough, my good uncle, for the constant care that you"
7778,ARGUMENT,"take for my happiness! Ah, my good uncle, I should be the happiest of men"
7779,ARGUMENT,"if Zosia were betrothed to me to-day, if I knew that she were to be my"
7780,ARGUMENT,"wife! However, I tell you frankly, this betrothal cannot take place"
7781,ARGUMENT,to-day; there are various reasons. Question me no further; if Zosia will
7782,ARGUMENT,"consent to wait, she may perhaps soon find in me a better man--and a man"
7783,ARGUMENT,"more worthy of her; perhaps by my constancy I shall gain her affection,"
7784,ARGUMENT,"perhaps I shall adorn my name with some trifling glory, perhaps I shall"
7785,ARGUMENT,"soon return to the home of my fathers. Then, uncle, I shall remind you of"
7786,ARGUMENT,"your promise, then on my knees I shall greet my dear Zosia, and, if she is"
7787,ARGUMENT,"free, I shall beg her hand; but now I am abandoning Lithuania, perhaps for"
7788,ARGUMENT,"long, and perhaps in the meantime another man may win Zosia's favour. I do"
7789,ARGUMENT,"not wish to bind her will, and to beg for an affection that I have not"
7790,ARGUMENT,"deserved would be a base act."""
7791,ARGUMENT,
7792,ARGUMENT,"While the young man, much moved, was uttering these words, two tears, like"
7793,ARGUMENT,"two great round pearls, shone in his great blue eyes and rolled down"
7794,ARGUMENT,quickly over his rosy cheeks.
7795,ARGUMENT,
7796,ARGUMENT,But the curious Zosia from the depths of the alcove had been following
7797,ARGUMENT,this mysterious conversation through a crack; she had heard Thaddeus tell
7798,ARGUMENT,"frankly and boldly of his love, and with fluttering heart she had seen"
7799,ARGUMENT,those two great tears in his eyes. Though she could not find the key to
7800,ARGUMENT,"his mystery, why he had fallen in love with her, why he was abandoning"
7801,ARGUMENT,"her, and where he was departing, nevertheless this departure made her sad."
7802,ARGUMENT,For the first time in her life she heard from the lips of a youth the
7803,ARGUMENT,great and marvellous news that she was beloved. So she ran to the little
7804,ARGUMENT,"altar of the house and took from it a picture, and a small reliquary; the"
7805,ARGUMENT,"picture was of Saint Genevieve, and in the reliquary was a bit of the robe"
7806,ARGUMENT,"of Saint Joseph the Bridegroom, the patron of youths and maidens who are"
7807,ARGUMENT,betrothed. With these sacred objects she entered the room:--
7808,ARGUMENT,
7809,ARGUMENT,"""Are you going away so soon? I want to give you a little present for the"
7810,ARGUMENT,journey and a bit of warning too: always carry with you these relics and
7811,ARGUMENT,"this picture, and remember Zosia. May the Lord God guide you in health and"
7812,ARGUMENT,"happiness and may he soon guide you back prosperously to us!"""
7813,ARGUMENT,
7814,ARGUMENT,"She ceased, and lowered her head; hardly had she closed her blue eyes,"
7815,ARGUMENT,"when floods of tears escaped from under her lashes, and Zosia stood there"
7816,ARGUMENT,"silent, with closed eyelids, shedding tears like diamonds."
7817,ARGUMENT,
7818,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus, taking his gifts, kissed her hand, and said: ""Panna Sophia, now"
7819,ARGUMENT,"I must bid you good-bye! Farewell, do not forget me, and deign sometimes"
7820,ARGUMENT,"to repeat a prayer for me! Sophia!----"" He could say no more."
7821,ARGUMENT,
7822,ARGUMENT,"But the Count, who had entered unexpectedly with Telimena and had observed"
7823,ARGUMENT,"the tender farewell of the young pair, was much moved, and said with a"
7824,ARGUMENT,glance at Telimena:--
7825,ARGUMENT,
7826,ARGUMENT,"""How much beauty is there even in this simple scene, when the soul of the"
7827,ARGUMENT,"shepherdess and the soul of the warrior, like a boat and a ship during a"
7828,ARGUMENT,"storm at sea, must at last be parted! In very truth nothing so kindles the"
7829,ARGUMENT,feelings in the heart as when heart separates from heart. Time is like a
7830,ARGUMENT,blast of wind; it extinguishes only the little candle; a great flame it

7832,ARGUMENT,"loving even more mightily at a distance. Pan Soplica, I regarded you as my"
7833,ARGUMENT,"rival; that mistake was one of the causes of our lamentable quarrel, which"
7834,ARGUMENT,"forced me to draw the sword against your household. I perceive my mistake,"
7835,ARGUMENT,"for you sighed to the little shepherdess, while I had given my heart to"
7836,ARGUMENT,this fair nymph. Let our differences be drowned in the blood of our
7837,ARGUMENT,country's enemies; we will no longer fight each other with the murderous
7838,ARGUMENT,steel! Let our amorous strife be settled otherwise; let us contend which
7839,ARGUMENT,shall surpass the other in the feeling of love! Let us both leave behind
7840,ARGUMENT,"the dear objects of our hearts, let us both hasten against swords and"
7841,ARGUMENT,"spears; let us contend with each other in constancy, sorrow, and"
7842,ARGUMENT,"suffering, and pursue our country's enemies with our manly arms!"""
7843,ARGUMENT,
7844,ARGUMENT,"He spoke and glanced at Telimena, but she made no reply, being overcome"
7845,ARGUMENT,with amazement.
7846,ARGUMENT,
7847,ARGUMENT,"""My dear Count,"" interrupted the Judge, ""why do you insist on departing?"
7848,ARGUMENT,"Believe me, you had best remain in security on your estate. The poor"
7849,ARGUMENT,"gentry may be skinned and scourged by the government, but you, Count, are"
7850,ARGUMENT,sure of being left whole. You know what sort of government you have to
7851,ARGUMENT,"deal with; you are fairly wealthy, and may ransom yourself from prison at"
7852,ARGUMENT,"the cost of only half your income for one year."""
7853,ARGUMENT,
7854,ARGUMENT,"""That is not in concord with my character,"" said the Count. ""Since I"
7855,ARGUMENT,"cannot be a lover, I will be a hero. Amid the cares of love I will call on"
7856,ARGUMENT,"glory as my comfortress; since I am a beggar of heart, I will be mighty of"
7857,ARGUMENT,"hand."""
7858,ARGUMENT,
7859,ARGUMENT,"""Who hinders you from loving and being happy?"" inquired Telimena."
7860,ARGUMENT,
7861,ARGUMENT,"""The power of my destiny,"" said the Count, ""mysterious forebodings that"
7862,ARGUMENT,with a secret impulse urge me to foreign lands and to unwonted deeds. I
7863,ARGUMENT,confess that to-day I wished in honour of Telimena to light the flame on
7864,ARGUMENT,"the altars of Hymen, but this youth has given me too fair an example by"
7865,ARGUMENT,tearing off his marriage wreath of his own free will and rushing to test
7866,ARGUMENT,his heart amid the hindrances of changeful fortune and amid the bloody
7867,ARGUMENT,"chances of war. To-day for me, too, a new epoch is opened! Birbante-Rocca"
7868,ARGUMENT,has resounded with the renown of my arms; may this renown spread far and
7869,ARGUMENT,"wide in Poland also!"""
7870,ARGUMENT,
7871,ARGUMENT,"He concluded, and proudly smote his sword hilt."
7872,ARGUMENT,
7873,ARGUMENT,"""It is hard to blame such a desire,"" said Robak. ""Depart, but take money"
7874,ARGUMENT,"with you; you may equip a company of soldiers, like Wlodzimierz Potocki,"
7875,ARGUMENT,"who amazed the French by contributing a million to the treasury, or like"
7876,ARGUMENT,"Prince Dominik Radziwill, who abandoned his lands and goods and furnished"
7877,ARGUMENT,"two fresh regiments of cavalry. Go, go, but take money; across the Niemen"
7878,ARGUMENT,"we have hands enough, but money is scarce in the Grand Duchy; go, we bid"
7879,ARGUMENT,"you farewell!"""
7880,ARGUMENT,
7881,ARGUMENT,"""Alas!"" said Telimena with a mournful glance, ""I see that nothing will"
7882,ARGUMENT,"restrain you! My knight, when you enter the lists of battle, turn a"
7883,ARGUMENT,"feeling gaze on the colours of your belovèd."" (Here she tore a ribbon from"
7884,ARGUMENT,"her dress, made a cockade, and pinned it on the Count's bosom.) ""May these"
7885,ARGUMENT,"colours guide you against fiery cannon, against shining spears and"
7886,ARGUMENT,"sulphurous rains; and when you make yourself famous by warlike deeds, and"
7887,ARGUMENT,when you shade with immortal laurels your blood-stained helmet and your
7888,ARGUMENT,"casque, bold in victory, even then look once more on this cockade!"
7889,ARGUMENT,"Remember whose hand pinned upon you these colours!"""
7890,ARGUMENT,
7891,ARGUMENT,Here she offered him her hand. The Count knelt and kissed it; Telimena
7892,ARGUMENT,"raised her handkerchief to one eye, but with the other eye she looked down"
7893,ARGUMENT,"on the Count, who was bidding her farewell with deep emotion. She sighed,"
7894,ARGUMENT,but shrugged her shoulders.
7895,ARGUMENT,
7896,ARGUMENT,"But the Judge said: ""Hurry up, my dear Count, for it is already late!"" And"
7897,ARGUMENT,"the Monk Robak called out with a threatening mien: ""Enough of this; hurry"
7898,ARGUMENT,"up!"" Thus the orders of the Judge and the Monk separated the tender pair"
7899,ARGUMENT,and drove them from the room.
7900,ARGUMENT,
7901,ARGUMENT,Meanwhile Thaddeus had embraced his uncle with tears and was kissing
7902,ARGUMENT,"Robak's hand. Robak, pressing the lad's brow to his breast and hying his"
7903,ARGUMENT,"palms crosswise on his head, gazed aloft and said: ""My son, may God be"
7904,ARGUMENT,"with you!"" Then he began to weep. But Thaddeus was already beyond the"
7905,ARGUMENT,threshold.
7906,ARGUMENT,
7907,ARGUMENT,"""What, brother?"" asked the Judge, ""will you tell him nothing? not even"
7908,ARGUMENT,"now? Shall the poor lad still remain in ignorance, now that he is going to"
7909,ARGUMENT,"leave us!"""
7910,ARGUMENT,
7911,ARGUMENT,"""No, nothing!"" said the Monk, after a long interval of weeping, his face"
7912,ARGUMENT,"covered by his hands. ""Why should the poor fellow know that he has a"
7913,ARGUMENT,father who has hidden himself from the world as a scoundrel and a
7914,ARGUMENT,"murderer? God sees how I longed to tell him, but of that consolation I"
7915,ARGUMENT,"will make an offering to God, to expiate my former sins."""
7916,ARGUMENT,
7917,ARGUMENT,"""Then,"" said the Judge, ""it is now time for you to think of yourself. Pray"
7918,ARGUMENT,"reflect that a man of your age, in your weak condition, would be unable to"
7919,ARGUMENT,emigrate along with the others. You have said that you know a little house
7920,ARGUMENT,"where you must hide; tell me where it is. We must hasten, the waggon is"
7921,ARGUMENT,"waiting, ready harnessed; would it not be better to go to the woods, to"
7922,ARGUMENT,"the forester's hut?"""
7923,ARGUMENT,
7924,ARGUMENT,"""Early to-morrow morning will be time enough,"" said Robak, nodding his"
7925,ARGUMENT,"head. ""Now, my brother, send for the priest to come here as quickly as may"
7926,ARGUMENT,"be with the viaticum; send off every one but the Warden, and shut the"
7927,ARGUMENT,"door."""
7928,ARGUMENT,
7929,ARGUMENT,The Judge carried out Robak's instructions and sat down on the bed beside
7930,ARGUMENT,"him; but Gerwazy remained standing, resting his elbow on the pommel of his"
7931,ARGUMENT,"sword, and leaning his bent brow on his hands."
7932,ARGUMENT,
7933,ARGUMENT,"Robak, before beginning to speak, riveted his gaze on the face of the"
7934,ARGUMENT,Warden and remained mysteriously silent. But as a surgeon first lays a
7935,ARGUMENT,gentle hand on the body of a sick man before he makes a cut with the
7936,ARGUMENT,"knife, so Robak softened the expression of his sharp eyes, which he"
7937,ARGUMENT,"allowed to hover for a long time over the eyes of Gerwazy; finally, as if"
7938,ARGUMENT,"he wished to strike a blind blow, he covered his eyes with his hand and"
7939,ARGUMENT,said with a powerful voice:--
7940,ARGUMENT,
7941,ARGUMENT,"""I am Jacek Soplica."""
7942,ARGUMENT,
7943,ARGUMENT,"At these words the Warden turned pale, bowed down, and, with half his body"
7944,ARGUMENT,"bent forward, remained fixed in this position, hung upon one foot, like a"
7945,ARGUMENT,stone flying from on high but checked in its course. He raised his eyelids
7946,ARGUMENT,and opened wide his mouth with its threatening white teeth; his mustaches
7947,ARGUMENT,"bristled; his sword dropped from his hands, but he caught it near the"
7948,ARGUMENT,"floor with his knees and held the pommel with his right hand, gripping it"
7949,ARGUMENT,convulsively: the long black blade of the sword stretched out behind him
7950,ARGUMENT,"and shook back and forth. And the Warden was like a wounded lynx, about to"
7951,ARGUMENT,spring from a tree into the very face of a hunter: it puffs itself into a
7952,ARGUMENT,"ball, growls, flashes fire from its bloody eyeballs, twitches its whiskers"
7953,ARGUMENT,and lashes its tail.
7954,ARGUMENT,
7955,ARGUMENT,"""Pan Rembajlo,"" said the Monk, ""I am no longer alarmed by the wrath of"
7956,ARGUMENT,"men, for already I am under the hand of God. I adjure thee in the name of"
7957,ARGUMENT,"Him who saved the world, and on the cross blessed His murderers and"
7958,ARGUMENT,"accepted the prayer of the robber, that you relent, and hear in patience"
7959,ARGUMENT,what I have to say. I have myself declared my name; to ease my conscience
7960,ARGUMENT,I must gain or at least beg forgiveness. Hear my confession; then you will
7961,ARGUMENT,"do with me as you wish."""
7962,ARGUMENT,
7963,ARGUMENT,Here he joined his two hands as though in prayer; the Warden drew back
7964,ARGUMENT,"amazed, smote his hand on his brow and shrugged his shoulders."
7965,ARGUMENT,
7966,ARGUMENT,And the Monk began to tell of his former intimacy with the Horeszko and of
7967,ARGUMENT,"the love between him and the Pantler's daughter, and of the enmity between"
7968,ARGUMENT,the two men that thence arose. But he spoke confusedly; often he mixed
7969,ARGUMENT,"accusations and complaints in his confession, often he interrupted his"
7970,ARGUMENT,"speech as though he had ended, and then began anew."
7971,ARGUMENT,
7972,ARGUMENT,"The Warden, who was thoroughly familiar with the story of the Horeszkos,"
7973,ARGUMENT,"straightened out in his mind the whole tale, though it was sadly tangled,"
7974,ARGUMENT,and could fill up the gaps in it; but the Judge entirely failed to
7975,ARGUMENT,"understand many points. Both listened attentively, bending their heads"
7976,ARGUMENT,"forward; but Jacek spoke more and more slowly, and often interrupted"
7977,ARGUMENT,himself.

7981,ARGUMENT,"""You already know, my dear Gerwazy, how often the Pantler used to invite"
7982,ARGUMENT,"me to banquets; he would propose my health, and many a time he cried,"
7983,ARGUMENT,"raising his beaker aloft, that he had no better friend than Jacek Soplica."
7984,ARGUMENT,How he would embrace me! All who saw it thought that he shared his very
7985,ARGUMENT,soul with me. He a friend? He knew what then was passing within my soul!

7991,ARGUMENT,"too high for the feet of Jacek the Cup-Bearer's son.' I laughed,"
7992,ARGUMENT,"pretending that I mocked at magnates and their daughters, and that I cared"
7993,ARGUMENT,"nothing for aristocrats; that if I often visited them, I did it out of"
7994,ARGUMENT,"mere friendship, and that I would never marry outside my own station in"
7995,ARGUMENT,life. And yet these jests pricked my soul to the quick: I was young and
7996,ARGUMENT,"daring, and the world was open to me in a land where, as you know, one"
7997,ARGUMENT,born a simple gentleman may be chosen king just as freely as the most
7998,ARGUMENT,powerful lord. Once Tenczynski asked in marriage a daughter of a royal
7999,ARGUMENT,"house, and the King gave her to him without shame.173 Are not the Soplicas"

8021,ARGUMENT,"But he, the proud and cunning lord, formed a new plan; he pretended that"

8180,ARGUMENT,and are you Jacek? the Soplica? in a monk's cowl? Have you been living a
8181,ARGUMENT,"beggar's life! You, whom I remember when you were strong and rosy, a"
8182,ARGUMENT,"handsome gentlemen, when lords flattered you, when women went mad over"
8183,ARGUMENT,you! The mustachioed champion! That was not so long ago! it is grief that
8184,ARGUMENT,"has aged you thus! How could I fail to recognise you from that shot, when"
8185,ARGUMENT,you hit the bear with so sure an aim? For our Lithuania had no better
8186,ARGUMENT,"marksman than you, and next to Maciek you were also the foremost"
8187,ARGUMENT,swordsman! It is the truth! Once the gentlewomen sang of you:--
8188,ARGUMENT,
8189,ARGUMENT,"When Jacek twirls his whisker, men tremble far and near;"
8190,ARGUMENT,"'Gainst whom he knots his whisker, that man feels mortal fear--"
8191,ARGUMENT,"Though he be Prince Radziwill, to fight he will not dare."
8192,ARGUMENT,
8193,ARGUMENT,You tied a knot against my lord! Unhappy man! And is it you? Fallen to
8194,ARGUMENT,such a state! The mustachioed Jacek a monkish alms-gatherer! Great are the
8195,ARGUMENT,judgments of God! And now! ha! you cannot escape the penalty; I have
8196,ARGUMENT,"sworn, he who has shed a drop of the Horeszkos' blood----"""
8197,ARGUMENT,
8198,ARGUMENT,Meanwhile the Monk had raised himself to a sitting posture on the bed; and
8199,ARGUMENT,he thus concluded:--
8200,ARGUMENT,
8201,ARGUMENT,"""I rode around the castle; who can tell the names of all the devils that"
8202,ARGUMENT,filled my head and heart! The Pantler? Is he slaying his own child as he
8203,ARGUMENT,has already slain and ruined me?--I rode up to the gate; a demon enticed me
8204,ARGUMENT,there. Look how he revels! Every day a drinking bout in the castle! How
8205,ARGUMENT,"many candles there are in the windows, what music peals through the halls!"
8206,ARGUMENT,And shall not this castle crash down upon his bald head?
8207,ARGUMENT,
8208,ARGUMENT,"""Think of vengeance, and a demon will at once furnish you a weapon. Hardly"
8209,ARGUMENT,"had I thought of it, when the demon sent the Muscovites. I stood gazing;"
8210,ARGUMENT,you know how they stormed your castle.
8211,ARGUMENT,
8212,ARGUMENT,* * * * * * * *
8213,ARGUMENT,
8214,ARGUMENT,"""For it is false that I was in any league with the Muscovites."
8215,ARGUMENT,
8216,ARGUMENT,* * * * * * * *
8217,ARGUMENT,
8218,ARGUMENT,"""I gazed; various thoughts passed through my head: at first with a stupid"
8219,ARGUMENT,laugh I gazed as a child upon a burning house; then I felt a murderous
8220,ARGUMENT,"joy, expecting that speedily it would begin to blaze and totter; at times"
8221,ARGUMENT,I was prompted to leap in and save her--even the Pantler----
8222,ARGUMENT,
8223,ARGUMENT,* * * * * * * *
8224,ARGUMENT,
8225,ARGUMENT,"""Your defence, as you know, was vigorous and prompt. I was amazed; the"
8226,ARGUMENT,Muscovites kept falling close by me; the beasts aimed poorly.--At the sight
8227,ARGUMENT,of their overthrow hatred again overcame me.--That Pantler a victor! And
8228,ARGUMENT,shall he prosper thus in his every purpose? And shall he triumph even over
8229,ARGUMENT,"this fearful assault? I was riding away, smitten with shame.--Day was just"
8230,ARGUMENT,dawning; suddenly I beheld him and recognised him; he stepped out on the
8231,ARGUMENT,balcony and his diamond buckle glittered in the sun; proudly he twirled
8232,ARGUMENT,his mustache and proudly gazed around; and it seemed to me that he mocked
8233,ARGUMENT,"at me above all others, that he had recognised me and that thus he pointed"
8234,ARGUMENT,"his hand at me, scoffing and threatening,--I seized a carbine from a"
8235,ARGUMENT,"Muscovite; I barely raised it to my shoulder, scarcely aimed--it went off!"
8236,ARGUMENT,You know the rest!
8237,ARGUMENT,
8238,ARGUMENT,"""Cursed firearms! He who slays with the sword must take his stand and"
8239,ARGUMENT,press on; he parries and flourishes; he may disarm his enemy and check his
8240,ARGUMENT,sword halfway. But with these firearms it is enough to hold the gun; an
8241,ARGUMENT,"instant, a single spark----"
8242,ARGUMENT,
8243,ARGUMENT,* * * * * * * *
8244,ARGUMENT,
8245,ARGUMENT,"""Did I flee when you aimed at me from above? I levelled my eyes at the two"

8247,ARGUMENT,"Why, Gerwazy, ah why did you miss at that time? You would have done me a"
8248,ARGUMENT,"kindness!--evidently as a penance for my sin I must needs----"""
8249,ARGUMENT,
8250,ARGUMENT,Here his breath failed him once more.
8251,ARGUMENT,
8252,ARGUMENT,"""God knows,"" said the Warden, ""I sincerely wished to hit you! How much"
8253,ARGUMENT,blood did you shed by your one shot! How many disasters have fallen upon
8254,ARGUMENT,"us and upon your family, and all of them through your guilt alone, Pan"
8255,ARGUMENT,"Jacek! And yet to-day, when the yagers aimed at the Count (the last of the"
8256,ARGUMENT,"Horeszkos, though in the female line), you preserved him; and when the"
8257,ARGUMENT,"Muscovites shot at me you threw me on the ground, so that you have been"
8258,ARGUMENT,"the saviour of us both. If it is true that you are a monk, in holy orders,"
8259,ARGUMENT,"then your habit shields you from my penknife. Farewell, I will set foot no"
8260,ARGUMENT,more upon your threshold; our account is clear--let us leave the rest to
8261,ARGUMENT,"the Lord."""
8262,ARGUMENT,
8263,ARGUMENT,Jacek stretched out his hand--but Gerwazy started back.
8264,ARGUMENT,
8265,ARGUMENT,"""Without dishonour to my noble blood,"" he said, ""I cannot touch a hand"
8266,ARGUMENT,"denied by such a murder, committed for private vengeance, and not _pro"
8267,ARGUMENT,"publico bono_."""
8268,ARGUMENT,
8269,ARGUMENT,"But Jacek, sinking from the pillows into the bed, turned to the Judge and"
8270,ARGUMENT,"grew more and more pale; he eagerly asked for the parish priest, and cried"
8271,ARGUMENT,to the Warden:--
8272,ARGUMENT,
8273,ARGUMENT,"""I implore you to remain; in a moment more I shall finish; hardly have I"
8274,ARGUMENT,"strength to conclude--Warden--I shall die this night."""
8275,ARGUMENT,
8276,ARGUMENT,"""What, brother?"" cried the Judge, ""I have seen your wound; it is trifling:"
8277,ARGUMENT,why do you say this? Send for the priest! Perhaps it has been ill tended:
8278,ARGUMENT,"I will send for the doctor; he is at the apothecary's."""
8279,ARGUMENT,
8280,ARGUMENT,"""It is too late, brother,"" interrupted the Monk. ""In the same place I have"
8281,ARGUMENT,"an earlier gunshot wound; I received it at Jena. It was ill healed, and"
8282,ARGUMENT,now it has been irritated--there is gangrene there already. I am familiar
8283,ARGUMENT,"with wounds; see how black the blood is, like soot; a doctor could do"
8284,ARGUMENT,nothing. But this is a trifle; we die but once; to-morrow or to-day we
8285,ARGUMENT,"must yield up our souls. Warden, thou wilt forgive me; I must die!"
8286,ARGUMENT,
8287,ARGUMENT,* * * * * * * *
8288,ARGUMENT,
8289,ARGUMENT,"""There is merit in refusing to betray your country, though your own people"

8291,ARGUMENT,
8292,ARGUMENT,* * * * * * * *
8293,ARGUMENT,
8294,ARGUMENT,"""The name of traitor clove to me like a pestilence. The neighbours turned"
8295,ARGUMENT,"their faces from me, my former friends fled from me, the timid greeted me"
8296,ARGUMENT,"from afar and turned aside; even a mere peasant boor or a Jew, though he"
8297,ARGUMENT,"bowed, would, as he passed by, smite me with a sneering laugh. The word"
8298,ARGUMENT,'traitor' rang in my ears and echoed through my house and over my fields;
8299,ARGUMENT,that word from morn till dark hovered before me like a spot before a sick
8300,ARGUMENT,man's eye. And yet I was _not_ a traitor to my country.
8301,ARGUMENT,
8302,ARGUMENT,"""The Muscovites showed by acts of violence that they regarded me as one of"
8303,ARGUMENT,their partisans: they gave the Soplicas a considerable part of the dead

8305,ARGUMENT,upon me.176 If I had then consented to turn Muscovite!--Satan counselled
8306,ARGUMENT,it--I was already influential and rich; but if I had become a

8365,ARGUMENT,
8366,ARGUMENT,"""Even so may God forgive you too!"" interrupted the Warden. ""Father Jacek,"
8367,ARGUMENT,"if you are now about to take the sacrament, remember that I am no Lutheran"

8372,ARGUMENT,"my lord shook his head and stretched out his hand towards the door,"
8373,ARGUMENT,"towards the place where you were standing, and drew a cross in the air; he"

8375,ARGUMENT,"understood well, but I was so furious with rage that I have never said"
8376,ARGUMENT,"even a word of that cross."""
8377,ARGUMENT,
8378,ARGUMENT,Here the sufferings of the sick man made further speech impossible and a
8379,ARGUMENT,long hour of silence followed. They were awaiting the priest. The thunder
8380,ARGUMENT,"of hoofs was heard, and the Tavern-Keeper, out of breath, knocked at the"
8381,ARGUMENT,"chamber door; he brought an important letter, which he showed to Jacek."
8382,ARGUMENT,Jacek gave it to his brother and bade him read it aloud. The letter was
8383,ARGUMENT,"from Fiszer,177 who was then Chief of Staff of the Polish army under"
8384,ARGUMENT,Prince Joseph. It brought the news that in the Privy Council of the
8385,ARGUMENT,"Emperor war had been declared, and that the Emperor was already"
8386,ARGUMENT,proclaiming it over the whole world; that a General Diet had been convoked
8387,ARGUMENT,"in Warsaw, and that the assembled representatives of Masovia would"
8388,ARGUMENT,solemnly decree the union of Lithuania with the Grand Duchy.
8389,ARGUMENT,
8390,ARGUMENT,"Jacek, as he listened, repeated prayers in a low voice, and, clasping to"
8391,ARGUMENT,"his breast the consecrated candle, raised to Heaven his eyes, now kindled"
8392,ARGUMENT,"with hope, and shed a flood of last joyous tears. ""Now, O Lord,"" he said,"
8393,ARGUMENT,"""let thy servant depart in peace!"" All kneeled; and then a bell rang at"
8394,ARGUMENT,"the door, a token that the priest had arrived with the body of our Lord."
8395,ARGUMENT,
8396,ARGUMENT,"Night was just departing, and across the milky sky were streaming the"
8397,ARGUMENT,first rosy beams of the sun: they entered through the window panes like
8398,ARGUMENT,"diamond arrows, and fell upon the bed; they surrounded the head of the"
8399,ARGUMENT,"sick man, wreathing with gold his face and his temples, so that he shone"
8400,ARGUMENT,like a saint in a fiery crown.

8420,ARGUMENT,MEMORABLE year! Happy is he who beheld thee in our land! The folk still
8421,ARGUMENT,"call thee the year of harvest, but the soldiers the year of war; old men"
8422,ARGUMENT,still love to tell tales of thee and poets still dream of thee. Thou hadst
8423,ARGUMENT,long been heralded by the marvel in the sky and preceded by a vague rumour
8424,ARGUMENT,among the folk; with the coming of the spring sun the hearts of the
8425,ARGUMENT,"Lithuanians were seized with a certain strange foreboding, as if the end"
8426,ARGUMENT,of the world were approaching--by a certain yearning and joyous
8427,ARGUMENT,expectation.
8428,ARGUMENT,
8429,ARGUMENT,"In the spring, when the cattle were driven forth for the first time, men"
8430,ARGUMENT,"noticed that, though famished and lean, they did not run to the young"
8431,ARGUMENT,"corn179 that already made gay the fields, but lay down on the ploughed"
8432,ARGUMENT,"land, and, drooping their heads, either lowed or chewed the cud of their"
8433,ARGUMENT,winter food.
8434,ARGUMENT,
8435,ARGUMENT,"The villagers too, as they ploughed for the spring grain, did not show"
8436,ARGUMENT,"their wonted joy in the end of the long winter; they did not sing songs,"
8437,ARGUMENT,"but worked lazily, as though forgetful of the sowing and the harvest. As"
8438,ARGUMENT,"they harrowed, at every step they checked their oxen and their nags, and"
8439,ARGUMENT,"gazed anxiously towards the west, as though from this direction some"
8440,ARGUMENT,"marvel were about to appear. And they regarded anxiously the birds, which"
8441,ARGUMENT,were returning home; for already the stork had flown back to its native
8442,ARGUMENT,"pine and had spread its white wings, the early standard of spring; and"
8443,ARGUMENT,"after it the swallows, coming on in noisy regiments, gathered above the"
8444,ARGUMENT,"waters, and from the frozen earth collected mud for their tiny houses. At"
8445,ARGUMENT,evening in the thickets one could hear the calling of the woodcocks as
8446,ARGUMENT,they rose from the earth; and flocks of wild geese honked over the forest
8447,ARGUMENT,"and, wearied, settled noisily down to feed; and in the depths of the dark"
8448,ARGUMENT,"heaven the cranes kept up a continuous clamour. Hearing this, the night"
8449,ARGUMENT,watchmen would ask in dread whence came such disorder in the winged
8450,ARGUMENT,"kingdom, and what storm had driven forth these birds so early."
8451,ARGUMENT,
8452,ARGUMENT,"And now new swarms, like flocks of finches, plover, and starlings, swarms"
8453,ARGUMENT,of bright plumes and pennons shone bright upon the hills and came down
8454,ARGUMENT,"into the meadows. It was cavalry! In strange array, and arms never seen"
8455,ARGUMENT,"before, came regiment after regiment; and straight across the country,"
8456,ARGUMENT,"like melted snows, the iron-shod ranks flowed along the roads. From the"
8457,ARGUMENT,"forests emerged black shakos, a row of bayonets glittered, and the"
8458,ARGUMENT,"infantry, countless as ants, swarmed forth."
8459,ARGUMENT,
8460,ARGUMENT,"All were turned towards the north; you would have said that at that time,"
8461,ARGUMENT,"coming from the Sunny South180 and following the birds, men too were"
8462,ARGUMENT,"entering our land, driven on by the force of some instinct that they could"
8463,ARGUMENT,not comprehend.
8464,ARGUMENT,
8465,ARGUMENT,"Steeds, men, cannon, eagles flowed on day and night; here and there fires"
8466,ARGUMENT,"glowed in the sky; the earth trembled, in the distance one could hear the"
8467,ARGUMENT,rolling of thunder.--
8468,ARGUMENT,
8469,ARGUMENT,War! war! There was no corner in the Lithuanian land to which its roar did
8470,ARGUMENT,"not reach; amid dark forests, the peasant, whose grandfathers and kinsmen"
8471,ARGUMENT,"had died without seeing beyond the boundaries of the wood, who understood"
8472,ARGUMENT,"no other cries in the sky than those of the winds, and none on earth"
8473,ARGUMENT,"except the roaring of beasts, who had seen no other guests than his"
8474,ARGUMENT,"fellow-woodsmen, now beheld how a strange glare flamed in the sky--in the"
8475,ARGUMENT,forest there was a crash--that was a cannon ball that had wandered from the
8476,ARGUMENT,"battlefield and was seeking a path in the wood, tearing up stumps and"
8477,ARGUMENT,"cutting through boughs. The hoary, bearded bison trembled in his mossy"
8478,ARGUMENT,"lair and bristled up his long shaggy mane; he half rose, resting on his"
8479,ARGUMENT,"forelegs, and, shaking his beard, he gazed in amazement at the sparks"
8480,ARGUMENT,suddenly glittering amid the brushwood: this was a stray bombshell that
8481,ARGUMENT,"twirled and whirled and hissed, and at last broke with a roar like"
8482,ARGUMENT,thunder; the bison for the first time in his life was terrified and fled
8483,ARGUMENT,to take refuge in deeper hiding.
8484,ARGUMENT,
8485,ARGUMENT,"""A battle! Where? In what direction?"" asked the young men, as they seized"
8486,ARGUMENT,"their arms; the women raised their hands in prayer to Heaven. All, sure of"
8487,ARGUMENT,"victory, cried out with tears in their eyes: ""God is with Napoleon and"
8488,ARGUMENT,"Napoleon is with us!"""
8489,ARGUMENT,
8490,ARGUMENT,O spring! Happy is he who beheld thee then in our country! Memorable
8491,ARGUMENT,"spring of war, spring of harvest! O spring, happy is he who beheld how"
8492,ARGUMENT,"thou didst bloom with corn and grass, but glittered with men; how thou"
8493,ARGUMENT,"wert rich in events and big with hope! I see thee still, fair phantom of"
8494,ARGUMENT,"my dream! Born in slavery and chained in my swaddling bands, I have had"
8495,ARGUMENT,but one such spring in my whole life.
8496,ARGUMENT,
8497,ARGUMENT,Soplicowo lay close by the highway along which two generals were pressing
8498,ARGUMENT,"forward from the Niemen. Our own Prince Joseph and Jerome, King of"
8499,ARGUMENT,"Westphalia,181 had already occupied Lithuania from Grodno to Slonim, when"
8500,ARGUMENT,the King issued orders to give the army three days of repose. But the
8501,ARGUMENT,"Polish soldiers, despite their hardships, murmured because the King would"
8502,ARGUMENT,not permit them to march on; so eager were they to overtake the Muscovites
8503,ARGUMENT,at the earliest possible moment.
8504,ARGUMENT,
8505,ARGUMENT,"The main staff of the Prince had halted in the town near by, but in"
8506,ARGUMENT,"Soplicowo was a camp of forty thousand men, and with them Generals"
8507,ARGUMENT,"Dombrowski,182 Kniaziewicz,183 Malachowski,184 Giedrojc,185 and"
8508,ARGUMENT,"Grabowski,186 with their staffs."
8509,ARGUMENT,
8510,ARGUMENT,"As it was late when they arrived, each man chose quarters wherever he"
8511,ARGUMENT,"could, either in the old castle or in the mansion; soon orders had been"
8512,ARGUMENT,"issued and guards stationed, and each weary man went to his chamber for"
8513,ARGUMENT,"sleep. As night drew on all became quiet, both camp, mansion, and field;"
8514,ARGUMENT,"one could see only the patrols wandering about like shadows, and here and"
8515,ARGUMENT,there the flickering of the camp fires; one could hear only the watchwords
8516,ARGUMENT,being passed about from post to post in the army.
8517,ARGUMENT,
8518,ARGUMENT,"All slept, the master of the house, the generals, and the soldiers; the"
8519,ARGUMENT,eyes of the Seneschal alone were not closed in sweet slumber. For on the
8520,ARGUMENT,morrow the Seneschal had to arrange a banquet by which he would fain make
8521,ARGUMENT,famous the house of the Soplicas for ever and ever; a banquet worthy of
8522,ARGUMENT,"guests so dear to Polish hearts, and in keeping with the great solemnity"
8523,ARGUMENT,"of the day, which was both a church holiday and a family holiday; on the"
8524,ARGUMENT,"morrow the betrothals of three couples were to take place. Moreover,"
8525,ARGUMENT,General Dombrowski had made known that evening that he wished to have a
8526,ARGUMENT,Polish dinner.
8527,ARGUMENT,
8528,ARGUMENT,"Though the hour was late, the Seneschal had gathered cooks from the"
8529,ARGUMENT,neighbourhood with all possible speed; there were five of them working
8530,ARGUMENT,"under his direction. As head cook he had girt him with a white apron,"
8531,ARGUMENT,"donned a nightcap, and tucked up his sleeves to the elbows. In one hand he"
8532,ARGUMENT,"held a fly-flapper, and with it he drove away insects of all sorts, which"
8533,ARGUMENT,were settling greedily on the dainties; with the other hand he put on his
8534,ARGUMENT,"well-wiped spectacles, took a book from his bosom, unwrapped it, and"
8535,ARGUMENT,opened it.
8536,ARGUMENT,
8537,ARGUMENT,This book was entitled _The Perfect Cook_.187 Herein were described in
8538,ARGUMENT,detail all the dishes peculiar to the Polish table: with its aid the Count
8539,ARGUMENT,of Tenczyn was wont to give those banquets in the Italian land at which
8540,ARGUMENT,"the Holy Father Urban VIII. marvelled;188 by its aid, later on, Karol"
8541,ARGUMENT,"My-dear-friend Radziwill,189 when he entertained King Stanislaw at"
8542,ARGUMENT,"Nieswiez, arranged that memorable feast the fame of which still lives"
8543,ARGUMENT,throughout Lithuania in popular tales.
8544,ARGUMENT,
8545,ARGUMENT,"What the Seneschal read, understood, and proclaimed, that straightway did"
8546,ARGUMENT,the skilful cooks carry out. The work seethed: fifty knives clattered on
8547,ARGUMENT,"the tables; scullions black as demons rushed about, some carrying wood,"
8548,ARGUMENT,"others pails of milk and wine; they poured them into kettles, spiders, and"
8549,ARGUMENT,"stew-pans, and the steam burst forth. Two scullions sat by the stove and"
8550,ARGUMENT,"puffed at the bellows; the Seneschal, the more easily to kindle the fire,"
8551,ARGUMENT,had given orders to have melted butter poured on the wood--this bit of
8552,ARGUMENT,extravagance is permitted in a well-to-do household. The scullions stuffed
8553,ARGUMENT,bundles of dry brushwood into the fire; others of them placed upon spits
8554,ARGUMENT,"immense roasts of beef and venison, and haunches of wild boars and of"
8555,ARGUMENT,stags; still others were plucking whole heaps of birds of all sorts--
8556,ARGUMENT,"clouds of down flew about, and grouse, heath cocks, and hens were stripped"
8557,ARGUMENT,bare. But there were very few hens: since the attack that bloodthirsty
8558,ARGUMENT,"Buzzard Dobrzynski had made on the hencoop at the time of the foray, when"
8559,ARGUMENT,"he had annihilated Zosia's establishment, without leaving a bit for"
8560,ARGUMENT,"medicine,190 Soplicowo, once famous for its poultry, had not yet managed"
8561,ARGUMENT,"to blossom out again with new birds. For the rest, there was a great"
8562,ARGUMENT,abundance of all the sorts of meats that could be gathered from the house
8563,ARGUMENT,"and from the butchers' shops, from the woods and from the neighbours, from"
8564,ARGUMENT,near and from far: you would have said that the only thing lacking was
8565,ARGUMENT,bird's milk. The two things that a generous man requires in order to give
8566,ARGUMENT,a feast were united at Soplicowo: plenty and art.
8567,ARGUMENT,
8568,ARGUMENT,Already the solemn day of the Most Holy Lady of Flowers191 was
8569,ARGUMENT,"approaching; the weather was lovely, the hour early; the clear sky was"
8570,ARGUMENT,"extended about the earth like a calm, hanging, concavo-convex sea. A few"
8571,ARGUMENT,"stars shone from its depths, like pearls from the sea bottom, seen through"
8572,ARGUMENT,"waves; on one side a little white cloud, all alone, drifted along and"
8573,ARGUMENT,"buried its wings in the azure, like the vanishing pinions of a guardian"
8574,ARGUMENT,"angel, who, detained through the night by the prayers of men, has been"
8575,ARGUMENT,"belated, and is hastening to return to his fellow-denizens of heaven."
8576,ARGUMENT,
8577,ARGUMENT,Already the last pearls of the stars had grown dim and been extinguished
8578,ARGUMENT,"in the depths of the sky, and the centre of the sky's brow was growing"
8579,ARGUMENT,"pale; its right temple, reposing on a pillow of shadow, was still swarthy,"
8580,ARGUMENT,but its left grew ever rosier; but farther off the horizon line parted
8581,ARGUMENT,"like a broad eyelid, and in the centre one could see the white of an eye,"
8582,ARGUMENT,one could see the iris and the pupil--now a ray darted forth and circled
8583,ARGUMENT,"and shimmered over the rounded heavens, and hung in the white cloud like a"
8584,ARGUMENT,"golden arrow. At this beam, at this signal of day, a cluster of fires flew"
8585,ARGUMENT,"forth, crossing one another a thousand times on the sphere of the"
8586,ARGUMENT,"skies--and the eye of the sun rose up--still somewhat sleepy, it blinked and"
8587,ARGUMENT,trembled and shook its gleaming lashes; it glittered with seven tints at
8588,ARGUMENT,"once: at first sapphire, it straightway turned blood red like a ruby, and"
8589,ARGUMENT,"yellow as a topaz; next it sparkled transparent as crystal, then was"
8590,ARGUMENT,"radiant as a diamond; finally it became the colour of pure flame, like a"
8591,ARGUMENT,"great moon, or like a twinkling star: thus over the measureless heaven"
8592,ARGUMENT,advanced the solitary sun.
8593,ARGUMENT,
8594,ARGUMENT,To-day from the whole neighbourhood the Lithuanian populace had gathered
8595,ARGUMENT,"before sunrise around the chapel, as if to hear some new marvel"
8596,ARGUMENT,proclaimed. This gathering was due in part to the piety of the folk and in
8597,ARGUMENT,part to curiosity; for to-day at Soplicowo the generals were to attend
8598,ARGUMENT,"service, those famous captains of our legions, whose names the folk knew"
8599,ARGUMENT,"and honoured as those of patron saints; all whose wanderings, cam-paigns,"
8600,ARGUMENT,and battles were the people's gospel throughout Lithuania.
8601,ARGUMENT,
8602,ARGUMENT,Now some officers and a throng of soldiers arrived. The folk surrounded
8603,ARGUMENT,"them and gazed upon them, and they could hardly believe their eyes when"
8604,ARGUMENT,"they beheld their fellow-countrymen wearing uniforms, and carrying"
8605,ARGUMENT,"arms--free, and speaking the Polish language!"
8606,ARGUMENT,
8607,ARGUMENT,The mass began. The little sanctuary could not contain the entire throng;
8608,ARGUMENT,"the folk kneeled on the grass, gazing at the door of the chapel, and bared"
8609,ARGUMENT,their heads. The white or yellow hair of the Lithuanian folk was gilded
8610,ARGUMENT,"like a field of ripe grain; here and there a maiden's fair head, decked"
8611,ARGUMENT,"with fresh flowers or with peacock's feathers, and with ribbons flowing"
8612,ARGUMENT,"loose from her braided hair, blossomed among the men's heads like a"
8613,ARGUMENT,"corn-flower or poppy amid the wheat. The kneeling, many-coloured throng"
8614,ARGUMENT,"covered the plain, and at the sound of the bell, as though at a breath of"
8615,ARGUMENT,"wind, all heads bent down like ears of corn on a field."
8616,ARGUMENT,
8617,ARGUMENT,To-day the village girls had brought to the altar of the Virgin Mother the
8618,ARGUMENT,first tribute of spring--fresh sheaves of greenery; everything was decked
8619,ARGUMENT,"with nosegays and garlands--the altar, the image, and even the belfry and"
8620,ARGUMENT,"the galleries. Sometimes a morning zephyr, stirring from the east, would"
8621,ARGUMENT,tear down the garlands and throw them upon the brows of the kneeling
8622,ARGUMENT,"worshippers, and would spread fragrance abroad as from a priest's censer."
8623,ARGUMENT,
8624,ARGUMENT,"When the mass and the sermon were over in the church, there came forth at"
8625,ARGUMENT,"the head of the whole gathering the Chamberlain, who had recently been"
8626,ARGUMENT,unanimously chosen Marshal of the Confederacy192 by the electoral assembly
8627,ARGUMENT,"of the district. He wore the uniform of the wojewodeship, a tunic"
8628,ARGUMENT,"embroidered with gold, a kontusz of gros-de-Tours with a fringe, and a"
8629,ARGUMENT,"massive brocade belt, on which hung a sabre with a hilt of lizard skin. At"
8630,ARGUMENT,"his neck shone a large diamond pin; his cap was white, and on it was a"
8631,ARGUMENT,"large tuft of costly feathers, the crests of white herons. (Only on"
8632,ARGUMENT,"festival days is worn so rich an ornament, every little feather of which"
8633,ARGUMENT,"is worth a ducat.) Thus adorned, he stepped up on a mound before the"
8634,ARGUMENT,church; the villagers and soldiers crowded around him: he spoke:--
8635,ARGUMENT,
8636,ARGUMENT,"""Brothers, the priest has proclaimed to you from the pulpit the liberty"
8637,ARGUMENT,"that the Emperor-King has already restored to the Kingdom, and is now"
8638,ARGUMENT,"restoring to the Duchy of Lithuania, to all Poland; you have heard the"
8639,ARGUMENT,official decrees and the letters convening a General Diet. I have only a
8640,ARGUMENT,few words to say to the company on a matter that pertains to the Soplica
8641,ARGUMENT,"family, the lords of this district."
8642,ARGUMENT,
8643,ARGUMENT,"""All the neighbourhood remembers the crime committed here by the deceased"
8644,ARGUMENT,"Pan Jacek Soplica; but, since you all know of his sins, it is time to"
8645,ARGUMENT,"proclaim his merits, also, before the world. Here are present the generals"
8646,ARGUMENT,"of our armies, from whom I have heard all that I tell you. This Jacek did"
8647,ARGUMENT,"not die at Rome, as was reported, but only changed his former way of life,"
8648,ARGUMENT,"his calling, and his name; and all his offences against God and his"
8649,ARGUMENT,country he has blotted out by his holy life and by great deeds.
8650,ARGUMENT,
8651,ARGUMENT,"""It was he who at Hohenlinden,193 when General Richepanse, half"
8652,ARGUMENT,"vanquished, was already preparing to retreat, not knowing that Kniaziewicz"
8653,ARGUMENT,"was on the way to his rescue--it was he, Jacek, called Robak, who amid"
8654,ARGUMENT,spears and swords brought to Richepanse from Kniaziewicz letters
8655,ARGUMENT,"announcing that our men were attacking the enemy in the rear. Later, in"
8656,ARGUMENT,"Spain, when our uhlans had taken the fortified ridge of Somosierra,194 he"
8657,ARGUMENT,"was wounded twice by the side of Kozietulski! Following this, as an"
8658,ARGUMENT,"emissary, with secret instructions, he traversed various quarters of our"
8659,ARGUMENT,"land, in order to watch the currents of popular feeling and to found and"
8660,ARGUMENT,"build up secret societies. Finally, at Soplicowo, in the home of his"
8661,ARGUMENT,"fathers, while he was paving the way for an insurrection, he perished in a"
8662,ARGUMENT,foray. The news of his death arrived in Warsaw just at the moment when His
8663,ARGUMENT,Majesty the Emperor deigned to bestow on him as a reward for his former
8664,ARGUMENT,heroic deeds the knightly badge of the Legion of Honour.
8665,ARGUMENT,
8666,ARGUMENT,"""Therefore, taking into consideration all these matters, I, as"
8667,ARGUMENT,"representative of the authority of the wojewodeship, proclaim to you with"
8668,ARGUMENT,my confederate's staff of office that Jacek by faithful service and by the
8669,ARGUMENT,"favour of the Emperor has removed the blot of infamy from his name, and"
8670,ARGUMENT,"has won back his honour, taking once more his place in the ranks of true"
8671,ARGUMENT,patriots. So whoever dares to speak a word at any time to the family of
8672,ARGUMENT,"the deceased Jacek of the offence that he long since atoned for, that man"
8673,ARGUMENT,"will be liable, as a penalty for such a taunt, to _gravis notæ macula_,195"
8674,ARGUMENT,"according to the words of the statutes, which thus punish both _militem_"
8675,ARGUMENT,and _skartabell_196 if he spread calumny against a citizen of the
8676,ARGUMENT,Commonwealth--and since general equality before the law has now been
8677,ARGUMENT,"proclaimed, therefore Article 3 is likewise binding on townsfolk and"
8678,ARGUMENT,serfs.197 This decree of the Marshal the Scribe will enter in the acts of
8679,ARGUMENT,"the General Confederation, and the Apparitor will proclaim it."
8680,ARGUMENT,
8681,ARGUMENT,"""As for the cross of the Legion of Honour, the fact that it arrived late"
8682,ARGUMENT,does not derogate from its glory; if it could not serve Jacek as an
8683,ARGUMENT,"adornment, let it serve as a memorial of him: I hang it on his grave. For"
8684,ARGUMENT,"three days it will hang there, then it will be deposited in the chapel, as"
8685,ARGUMENT,"a _votum_ for the Virgin."""
8686,ARGUMENT,
8687,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he took the badge from its case and hung on the modest cross"
8688,ARGUMENT,"that marked the grave a red ribbon knotted into a cockade, and a starry"
8689,ARGUMENT,white cross with a golden crown; the rays of the star shone in the
8690,ARGUMENT,sunlight like the last gleam of Jacek's earthly glory. Meanwhile the
8691,ARGUMENT,"kneeling folk repeated the Angelus, praying for the eternal repose of the"
8692,ARGUMENT,sinner; the Judge walked about among the guests and the throng of
8693,ARGUMENT,villagers and invited all to the banquet at Soplicowo.
8694,ARGUMENT,
8695,ARGUMENT,But on the bench of turf before the house two old men had taken their
8696,ARGUMENT,"seats, each holding on his knees a tankard full of mead. They gazed into"
8697,ARGUMENT,"the garden, where amid the buds of bright-coloured poppy stood an uhlan"
8698,ARGUMENT,"like a sunflower, wearing a glittering head-dress adorned with gilded"
8699,ARGUMENT,metal and with a cock's feather; near him a little maid in a garment green
8700,ARGUMENT,as the lowly rue raised eyes blue as forget-me-nots towards the eyes of
8701,ARGUMENT,"the youth. Farther on girls were plucking flowers among the beds,"
8702,ARGUMENT,"purposely turning away their heads from the lovers, in order not to"
8703,ARGUMENT,embarrass their talk together.
8704,ARGUMENT,
8705,ARGUMENT,"But the old men, as they drank their mead and passed from hand to hand a"
8706,ARGUMENT,"bark snuffbox, continued their chat."
8707,ARGUMENT,
8708,ARGUMENT,"""Yes, yes, my dear Protazy,"" said Gerwazy the Warden. ""Yes, yes, my dear"
8709,ARGUMENT,"Gerwazy,"" said Protazy the Apparitor. ""Yes, yes indeed,"" they repeated in"
8710,ARGUMENT,"unison over and over again, nodding their heads in time to the words;"
8711,ARGUMENT,finally the Apparitor spoke:--
8712,ARGUMENT,
8713,ARGUMENT,"""That our lawsuit has a strange conclusion I do not deny; however, there"
8714,ARGUMENT,are precedents. I remember lawsuits in which worse outrages were committed
8715,ARGUMENT,"than in ours, and yet marriage articles ended the whole trouble: in this"
8716,ARGUMENT,"way Lopot was reconciled to the Borzdobohaty family, the Krepsztuls with"
8717,ARGUMENT,"the Kupsces, Putrament with Pikturna, Mackiewicz with the Odynieces, and"
8718,ARGUMENT,Turno with the Kwileckis. What am I saying! The Poles used to have worse
8719,ARGUMENT,broils with Lithuania than the Horeszkos with the Soplica family; but when
8720,ARGUMENT,"Queen Jadwiga198 took the matter under advisement, then that difficulty"
8721,ARGUMENT,too was settled out of court. It is a good thing when the parties have
8722,ARGUMENT,maidens or widows to give in marriage; then a compromise is always ready
8723,ARGUMENT,at hand. The longest suits are ordinarily with the Catholic clergy or with
8724,ARGUMENT,"close kindred, for then the cases cannot be concluded by marriage. Hence"
8725,ARGUMENT,"come the endless quarrels between the Lechites and the Russians, who"
8726,ARGUMENT,"proceed from Lech and Rus,199 two born brothers; hence also there were so"
8727,ARGUMENT,many prolonged lawsuits between the Lithuanians and the Knights of the
8728,ARGUMENT,"Cross, until Jagiello finally won. Hence finally that famous lawsuit of"
8729,ARGUMENT,"the Rymszas and the Dominicans long _pendebat_ on the calendar, until"
8730,ARGUMENT,"finally Father Dymsza, the syndic of the convent, won the case: whence the"
8731,ARGUMENT,"'proverb, the Lord God is greater than Lord Rymsza. And I may add, mead is"
8732,ARGUMENT,"better than the penknife."""
8733,ARGUMENT,
8734,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he drank off a tankard to the health of the Warden."
8735,ARGUMENT,
8736,ARGUMENT,"""True, true!"" replied Gerwazy with emotion. ""Strange have been the"
8737,ARGUMENT,fortunes of our beloved Kingdom and of our Lithuania! They are like a true
8738,ARGUMENT,"married pair! God joined them, and the devil divides them; God has his own"
8739,ARGUMENT,"and the devil has his own! Ah, dear brother Protazy, that our eyes should"
8740,ARGUMENT,see this--that these brethren from the Kingdom should visit us once more! I
8741,ARGUMENT,"served with them years ago, and remember that bold confederates came from"
8742,ARGUMENT,their country! If only my deceased lord the Pantler had lived to see this
8743,ARGUMENT,"hour! O Jacek, Jacek!--but why should we lament? Now Lithuania will soon be"
8744,ARGUMENT,"reunited to the Kingdom, and therewith all is forgiven and forgotten."""
8745,ARGUMENT,
8746,ARGUMENT,"""And it is strange,"" said Protazy, ""that in regard to this Zosia, for"
8747,ARGUMENT,"whose hand our Thaddeus is now suing, a year ago there was an omen, as it"
8748,ARGUMENT,"were a sign from Heaven."""
8749,ARGUMENT,
8750,ARGUMENT,"""Panna Sophia she should be called,"" interrupted the Warden, ""for she is"
8751,ARGUMENT,"now grown up, and is no longer a little girl; besides that, she comes of"
8752,ARGUMENT,"the blood of dignitaries; she is the granddaughter of the Pantler."""
8753,ARGUMENT,
8754,ARGUMENT,"""Well, it was an omen prophetic of her fate,"" Protazy concluded; ""I beheld"
8755,ARGUMENT,the omen with my own eyes. A year ago our servants were sitting here on a
8756,ARGUMENT,"holiday, drinking mead, and we saw--whack! there fell from the eaves two"
8757,ARGUMENT,"sparrows fighting, both old males. One, which was somewhat the younger,"
8758,ARGUMENT,"had a grey throat, the other a black one; they continued to scuffle about"
8759,ARGUMENT,"the yard, turning over and over, until they were buried in dust. We gazed"
8760,ARGUMENT,"at them, and meanwhile the servants whispered to one another that the"
8761,ARGUMENT,"black one must stand for the Horeszko, and the other for the Soplica. So,"
8762,ARGUMENT,"whenever the grey one was on top, they would cry, 'Vivat Soplica; foh, the"
8763,ARGUMENT,"Horeszko cowards!' but when it fell, they shouted, 'Get up, Soplica; don't"
8764,ARGUMENT,give in to the magnate--that's shameful for a gentleman!' So we laughed and
8765,ARGUMENT,"waited to see which would beat; but suddenly little Zosia, moved with pity"
8766,ARGUMENT,"for the birds, ran up and covered those warriors with her tiny hand: they"
8767,ARGUMENT,"still fought in her hands till the feathers flew, such was the fury of"
8768,ARGUMENT,"those little scamps. The old wives, looking at Zosia, quietly passed the"
8769,ARGUMENT,"word about, that it would certainly be that girl's destiny to reconcile"
8770,ARGUMENT,two families long at variance. So I see that the old wives' omen has
8771,ARGUMENT,"to-day come true. To be sure, at that time they had in mind the Count, and"
8772,ARGUMENT,"not Thaddeus."""
8773,ARGUMENT,
8774,ARGUMENT,"To this the Warden replied: ""There are strange things in the world; who"
8775,ARGUMENT,"can fathom them all! I too will tell you, sir, something which, though not"
8776,ARGUMENT,"so marvellous as that omen, is nevertheless hard to understand. You know"
8777,ARGUMENT,that in old days I should have been glad to drown the Soplica family in a
8778,ARGUMENT,spoonful of water; and yet of this young fellow Thaddeus I was always
8779,ARGUMENT,"immensely fond, from his childhood up. I took nonce that whenever he got"
8780,ARGUMENT,"into a fight with the other lads he always beat them; so, every time that"
8781,ARGUMENT,"he came to the castle, I kept stirring him up to difficult feats. He"
8782,ARGUMENT,"succeeded in everything, whether he set out to dislodge the doves from the"
8783,ARGUMENT,"tower, or to pluck the mistletoe from the oak, or to tear down a crow's"
8784,ARGUMENT,nest from the highest pine: he was equal to anything. I thought to
8785,ARGUMENT,myself--that boy was born under a happy star; too bad that he is a Soplica!
8786,ARGUMENT,"Who would have guessed that in him I was to greet the owner of the castle,"
8787,ARGUMENT,"the husband of Panna Sophia, Her Grace my Lady!"""
8788,ARGUMENT,
8789,ARGUMENT,"Here they broke off their conversation, but, deep in thought, they"
8790,ARGUMENT,"continued to drink; one could only hear now and then these brief words,"
8791,ARGUMENT,"""Yes, yes, Gerwazy""; ""Yes, Protazy."""
8792,ARGUMENT,
8793,ARGUMENT,"The bench adjoined the kitchen, the windows of which were standing open"
8794,ARGUMENT,and pouring forth smoke as from a conflagration; at last between the
8795,ARGUMENT,"clouds of smoke, like a white dove, flashed the shining nightcap of the"
8796,ARGUMENT,"head cook. The Seneschal, putting his head out of the kitchen window,"
8797,ARGUMENT,"above the heads of the old men, listened in silence to their talk, and"
8798,ARGUMENT,"finally handed them some biscuits in a saucer, with the remark:--"
8799,ARGUMENT,
8800,ARGUMENT,"""Have something to eat with your mead, and I will tell you a curious story"
8801,ARGUMENT,"of a quarrel that seemed likely to end in a bloody fight, when Rejtan,"
8802,ARGUMENT,"hunting in the depths of the forests of Naliboki, played a trick on the"
8803,ARGUMENT,Prince de Nassau. This trick he nearly atoned for with his own life; I
8804,ARGUMENT,"made up the gentlemen's quarrel, as I will tell you."""
8805,ARGUMENT,
8806,ARGUMENT,"But the Seneschal's story was interrupted by the cooks, who inquired whom"
8807,ARGUMENT,he would have set the table.
8808,ARGUMENT,
8809,ARGUMENT,"The Seneschal withdrew, and the old men, having finished their mead,"
8810,ARGUMENT,"turned their thoughtful eyes towards the centre of the garden, where that"
8811,ARGUMENT,"handsome uhlan was talking with the young lady. At that moment the uhlan,"
8812,ARGUMENT,"taking her hand in his left (his right hung in a sling, so that he was"
8813,ARGUMENT,"evidently wounded), addressed the lady with these words:--"
8814,ARGUMENT,
8815,ARGUMENT,"""Sophia, you positively must tell me this; before we exchange rings, I"
8816,ARGUMENT,must be sure of it. What does it matter that last winter you were prepared
8817,ARGUMENT,"to give me your promise? I did not accept your promise then, for what did"
8818,ARGUMENT,I care for such a forced promise? I had then stayed in Soplicowo but a
8819,ARGUMENT,"very short time, and I was not so vain as to flatter myself that by my"
8820,ARGUMENT,mere glance I could awaken love in you. I am no braggart; I wished by my
8821,ARGUMENT,"own merits to win your regard, even though I might have to wait long for"
8822,ARGUMENT,it. Now you are so gracious as to repeat your promise--how have I ever
8823,ARGUMENT,"deserved such favour? Perhaps you are taking me, Zosia, not so much from"
8824,ARGUMENT,"attachment, as because your uncle and aunt are urging you to do so; but"
8825,ARGUMENT,"marriage, Zosia, is a very serious matter: take counsel of your own heart"
8826,ARGUMENT,"and do not hearken to any one's authority, either to your uncle's threats"
8827,ARGUMENT,"or to your aunt's entreaties. If you feel for me nothing but kindness, we"
8828,ARGUMENT,may postpone this betrothal for a time; I do not wish to bind your will:
8829,ARGUMENT,"let us wait, Zosia. There is no reason for haste, especially since,"
8830,ARGUMENT,"yesterday evening, I received orders to remain here in Lithuania as"
8831,ARGUMENT,"instructor in the local regiment, until I am healed of my wounds. Well, my"
8832,ARGUMENT,"beloved Zosia?"""
8833,ARGUMENT,
8834,ARGUMENT,"Raising her head, and looking timidly into his eyes, Zosia replied:--"
8835,ARGUMENT,
8836,ARGUMENT,"""I do not now remember perfectly what happened so long ago; I know that"
8837,ARGUMENT,everybody told me that I must marry you. I always assent to the will of
8838,ARGUMENT,"Heaven and the will of my elders."" Then, lowering her eyes, she added:"
8839,ARGUMENT,"""Before your departure, if you remember, when Father Robak died on that"
8840,ARGUMENT,"stormy night, I saw that you were dreadfully sorry to leave us. You had"
8841,ARGUMENT,"tears in your eyes: those tears, I tell you truly, fell deep into my"
8842,ARGUMENT,"heart; since then I have trusted your word, that you were fond of me."
8843,ARGUMENT,"Whenever I have uttered a prayer for your success, I have always had"
8844,ARGUMENT,before my eyes the picture of you with those great shining tears. Later
8845,ARGUMENT,the Chamberlain's wife went to Wilno and took me there for the winter; but
8846,ARGUMENT,I longed for Soplicowo and for that little room where you met me for the
8847,ARGUMENT,"first time one evening by the table, and where you later bade me farewell."
8848,ARGUMENT,"In some strange way the memory of you, like seeds of kale planted in the"
8849,ARGUMENT,"fall, all through the winter sprouted in my heart, so that, as I tell you,"
8850,ARGUMENT,I continually longed for that little room; and something whispered to me
8851,ARGUMENT,that I should find you there again; and so it has happened. While thinking
8852,ARGUMENT,"of this, I often had your name on my lips as well--this was at Wilno in the"
8853,ARGUMENT,"carnival season; the girls said that I was in love. So now, if I love any"
8854,ARGUMENT,"one, it must surely be you."""
8855,ARGUMENT,
8856,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus, happy at such a proof of affection, took her arm and pressed it"
8857,ARGUMENT,"to him, and they left the garden for the lady's chamber, for that room"
8858,ARGUMENT,that Thaddeus had occupied ten years before.
8859,ARGUMENT,
8860,ARGUMENT,"At this moment the Notary was tarrying there in marvellous array, and"
8861,ARGUMENT,proffering his services to his betrothed lady: he bustled about and handed
8862,ARGUMENT,"her signet rings, little chains, gallipots and bottles and powders and"
8863,ARGUMENT,"patches; gay at heart, he gazed in triumph on the young damsel. The young"
8864,ARGUMENT,"damsel had finished making her toilet, and was sitting before the mirror"
8865,ARGUMENT,"taking counsel of the Graces; but the maids were still toiling over her,"
8866,ARGUMENT,some with curling irons in their hands were freshening the limp ringlets
8867,ARGUMENT,"of her tresses, others, on their knees, were working at a flounce."
8868,ARGUMENT,
8869,ARGUMENT,"While the Notary was thus tarrying with his betrothed, a scullion rapped"
8870,ARGUMENT,on the window to attract his attention; they had caught sight of a rabbit.
8871,ARGUMENT,"The rabbit, stealing out of the willows, had whisked over the meadow and"
8872,ARGUMENT,"leapt into the garden amid the growing vegetables; there it was seated,"
8873,ARGUMENT,and it was an easy matter to fright it from the cabbage patch and to
8874,ARGUMENT,"course it, stationing the hounds on the narrow path that it must take. The"
8875,ARGUMENT,"Assessor ran up, pulling Falcon by the collar; the Notary hurried after"
8876,ARGUMENT,"him, calling to Bobtail. The Seneschal made them both stand with their"
8877,ARGUMENT,"dogs near the fence, while he himself with his fly-flapper set out for the"
8878,ARGUMENT,"garden, and by trampling, whistling, and clapping his hands greatly"
8879,ARGUMENT,"terrified the poor beast. The huntsmen, each holding his hound by the"
8880,ARGUMENT,"collar, pointed their fingers to the spot from which the hare was to"
8881,ARGUMENT,"appear, and made a soft smacking sound with their lips; the hounds pricked"
8882,ARGUMENT,"up their ears, snuffed the wind with their muzzles and trembled"
8883,ARGUMENT,"impatiently, like two arrows set on one string. All at once the Seneschal"
8884,ARGUMENT,"shouted, ""At him,"" and the hare darted from behind the fence into the"
8885,ARGUMENT,"meadow, the hounds after him; and speedily, without making a single turn,"
8886,ARGUMENT,Falcon and Bobtail together fell upon the grey rabbit from opposite sides
8887,ARGUMENT,"at the same instant, like the two wings of a bird, and buried their teeth"
8888,ARGUMENT,"like talons in his back. The rabbit gave one cry, like a newborn babe,"
8889,ARGUMENT,"pitifully! The huntsmen ran up; it already lay breathless, and the hounds"
8890,ARGUMENT,were tearing the white fur beneath its belly.
8891,ARGUMENT,
8892,ARGUMENT,"The huntsmen were patting their dogs, but meanwhile while the Seneschal,"
8893,ARGUMENT,"drawing the hunting-knife that hung at his girdle, cut off the feet and"
8894,ARGUMENT,said:--
8895,ARGUMENT,
8896,ARGUMENT,"""To-day each dog shall receive an equal fee, for they have gained equal"
8897,ARGUMENT,glory; equal was their fleetness and equal was their toil; worthy is the
8898,ARGUMENT,"palace of Pac, and worthy is Pac of the palace;200 worthy are the huntsmen"
8899,ARGUMENT,"of the hounds, and worthy are the hounds of the huntsmen. Thus is ended"
8900,ARGUMENT,"your long and furious quarrel; I, whom you appointed your judge and"
8901,ARGUMENT,"stakeholder, at last give my verdict: you both have triumphed. I return"
8902,ARGUMENT,"your stakes; let each man keep his own, and do you both sign the treaty."""
8903,ARGUMENT,
8904,ARGUMENT,At the summons of the old man the huntsmen turned beaming faces on each
8905,ARGUMENT,other and joined their long parted right hands. Then the Notary spoke:--
8906,ARGUMENT,
8907,ARGUMENT,"""My stake was a horse with its caparison; I also agreed before the"
8908,ARGUMENT,district authorities to deposit my ring as a fee for the judge; a forfeit
8909,ARGUMENT,once pledged cannot be withdrawn. Let the Seneschal accept the ring as a
8910,ARGUMENT,"reminder of this incident, and let him have engraved on it either his own"
8911,ARGUMENT,"name or, if he prefers, the armorial bearings of the Hreczechas; the"
8912,ARGUMENT,"carnelian is smooth, the gold eleven carats fine. The uhlans have now"
8913,ARGUMENT,"commandeered my horse for their troop, but the caparison remains in my"
8914,ARGUMENT,"possession; every expert praises this caparison, that it is strong and"
8915,ARGUMENT,"comfortable, and pretty as a picture. The saddle is narrow, in the"
8916,ARGUMENT,"Turko-Cossack style; in front it has a pommel, and in the pommel are set"
8917,ARGUMENT,precious stones; the seat is covered with a damask pad. And when you leap
8918,ARGUMENT,"into your place, you rest on that soft down as comfortably as in a bed;"
8919,ARGUMENT,"and when you start to gallop""--here the Notary Bolesta, who, as is well"
8920,ARGUMENT,"known, was extremely fond of gestures, spread out his legs as though he"
8921,ARGUMENT,"were leaping on a horse, and then, imitating a gallop, he swayed slowly to"
8922,ARGUMENT,"and fro--""and when you start to gallop, then light flashes from the housing"
8923,ARGUMENT,"as though gold were dripping from your charger, for the side bands are"
8924,ARGUMENT,thickly set with gold and the broad silver stirrups are gilded; on the
8925,ARGUMENT,"straps of the bit and on the bridle glitter buttons of mother of pearl,"
8926,ARGUMENT,"and from the breastplate hangs a crescent shaped like Leliwa,201 that is,"
8927,ARGUMENT,"like the new moon. This whole splendid outfit was captured, as rumour"
8928,ARGUMENT,"reports, in the battle of Podhajce,202 from a certain Turkish noble of"
8929,ARGUMENT,"very high station. Accept it, Assessor, as a proof of my esteem."""
8930,ARGUMENT,
8931,ARGUMENT,"Happy in his gift, the Assessor replied:--"
8932,ARGUMENT,
8933,ARGUMENT,"""My stake was the gift that I once received from Prince Sanguszko--my"
8934,ARGUMENT,"elegant dog-collars, covered with lizard-skin, with rings of gold, and my"
8935,ARGUMENT,"leash woven of silk, the workmanship of which is as precious as the jewel"
8936,ARGUMENT,that glitters upon it. That outfit I wanted to leave as an inheritance for
8937,ARGUMENT,"my children; I shall surely have children, for you know that I am to be"
8938,ARGUMENT,"married to-day. But, my dear Notary, I beg you humbly that you will deign"
8939,ARGUMENT,"to accept that outfit in exchange for your rich caparison, and as a"
8940,ARGUMENT,reminder of the quarrel that was prolonged for so many years and has
8941,ARGUMENT,finally been concluded in a manner honourable to us both.--May harmony
8942,ARGUMENT,"flourish between us!"""
8943,ARGUMENT,
8944,ARGUMENT,"So they returned home, to proclaim at table that the quarrel between"
8945,ARGUMENT,Bobtail and Falcon had been concluded.
8946,ARGUMENT,
8947,ARGUMENT,There was a report that the Seneschal had raised that rabbit in the house
8948,ARGUMENT,"and slyly let it out into the garden, in order to make the huntsmen"
8949,ARGUMENT,friends by means of too easy a prey. The old man played his trick so
8950,ARGUMENT,"mysteriously that he completely fooled all Soplicowo. A scullion, some"
8951,ARGUMENT,"years later, whispered a word of this, wishing to embroil once more the"
8952,ARGUMENT,Assessor and the Notary; but in vain did he spread abroad reports
8953,ARGUMENT,"slanderous to the hounds--the Seneschal denied the story, and nobody"
8954,ARGUMENT,believed the scullion.
8955,ARGUMENT,
8956,ARGUMENT,"The guests were already assembled in the great hall of the castle, and"
8957,ARGUMENT,"were conversing around the table as they awaited the banquet, when the"
8958,ARGUMENT,"Judge entered in the uniform of a wojewoda, escorting Thaddeus and Sophia."
8959,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus, raising his left hand to his forehead, saluted his superior"
8960,ARGUMENT,"officers with a military bow. Sophia, lowering her eyes and blushing,"
8961,ARGUMENT,greeted the guests with a curtsy (she had been taught by Telimena how to
8962,ARGUMENT,"curtsy gracefully). On her head she wore a wreath, as a betrothed maiden;"
8963,ARGUMENT,"for the rest, her costume was the same that she had worn that morning in"
8964,ARGUMENT,"the chapel, when she brought in her spring sheaf for the Virgin Mary. She"
8965,ARGUMENT,"had reaped once more, for the guests, a fresh sheaf of greenery, and with"
8966,ARGUMENT,one hand she distributed flowers and grasses from it; with the other she
8967,ARGUMENT,"adjusted on her head her glittering sickle. The leaders, kissing her"
8968,ARGUMENT,"hands, took the posies; Zosia curtsied once more to all in turn, her"
8969,ARGUMENT,cheeks glowing.
8970,ARGUMENT,
8971,ARGUMENT,"Then General Kniaziewicz took her by the shoulders, and, imprinting a"
8972,ARGUMENT,"fatherly kiss on her brow, lifted the girl aloft and set her on the table;"
8973,ARGUMENT,"all clapped their hands and shouted ""Bravo!"" being charmed by the girl's"
8974,ARGUMENT,"figure and bearing, and more particularly by her Lithuanian village"
8975,ARGUMENT,"attire; since for these famous captains, who in their roving life had"
8976,ARGUMENT,"wandered so long in foreign lands, there was a marvellous charm in the"
8977,ARGUMENT,"national costume, which reminded them both of the years of their youth and"
8978,ARGUMENT,of their loves of long ago: so almost with tears they gathered around the
8979,ARGUMENT,table and gazed eagerly upon her. Some asked Zosia to raise her head and
8980,ARGUMENT,show her eyes; others begged her to be so kind as to turn around--the
8981,ARGUMENT,"bashful girl turned around, but covered her eyes with her hands. Thaddeus"
8982,ARGUMENT,looked on gaily and rubbed his hands.
8983,ARGUMENT,
8984,ARGUMENT,Whether some one had counselled Zosia to make her appearance in such
8985,ARGUMENT,"garments, or whether she knew by instinct (for a girl always guesses by"
8986,ARGUMENT,"instinct what is becoming to her), suffice it to say that this morning for"
8987,ARGUMENT,the first time in her life Zosia had been scolded for obstinacy by
8988,ARGUMENT,"Telimena, since she had refused to put on fashionable attire: at last by"
8989,ARGUMENT,her tears she had prevailed on them to let her remain in this village
8990,ARGUMENT,costume.
8991,ARGUMENT,
8992,ARGUMENT,She wore a long white underskirt and a short gown of green camlet with a
8993,ARGUMENT,"pink border; the bodice was also of green, laced crosswise with pink"
8994,ARGUMENT,ribbons from the waist to the neck; under it her bosom took refuge like a
8995,ARGUMENT,bud beneath leaves. On her shoulders shone the full white sleeves of the
8996,ARGUMENT,"shirt, like the wings of a butterfly stretched for flight; at the wrist"
8997,ARGUMENT,they were gathered and fastened with a ribbon; her throat was also
8998,ARGUMENT,"encircled by the close-fitting shirt, the collar of which was fastened"
8999,ARGUMENT,with a pink knot. Her earrings were artistically carved out of cherry
9000,ARGUMENT,stones; in their making Buzzard Dobrzynski had taken huge pride; they
9001,ARGUMENT,"represented two hearts with dart and flame, and had been a present to"
9002,ARGUMENT,Zosia when Buzzard was paying his court to her. About her collar hung two
9003,ARGUMENT,"strings of amber beads, and on her temples was a wreath of green rosemary;"
9004,ARGUMENT,the ribbons that decked her tresses Zosia had thrown back over her
9005,ARGUMENT,"shoulders. On her brow, as is the custom with reapers, she had fastened a"
9006,ARGUMENT,"curved sickle, freshly polished by cutting grasses, bright as the new moon"
9007,ARGUMENT,above the brow of Diana.
9008,ARGUMENT,
9009,ARGUMENT,All admired and clapped their hands. One of the officers took from his
9010,ARGUMENT,"pocket a portfolio containing bundles of papers; he undid them, sharpened"
9011,ARGUMENT,"his pencil, moistened it with his lips, gazed at Zosia, and began to draw."
9012,ARGUMENT,"Hardly had the Judge beheld the papers and pencils, when he recognised the"
9013,ARGUMENT,"artist, though he had been greatly changed by his colonel's uniform, his"
9014,ARGUMENT,"rich epaulets, his truly uhlan-like bearing, his blackened mustache, and a"
9015,ARGUMENT,"small Spanish beard. The Judge recognised the Count: ""How are you, Your"
9016,ARGUMENT,Excellency? So you keep a travelling painter's kit even in your cartridge
9017,ARGUMENT,"box!"" In very truth it was the young Count. He was a soldier of no long"
9018,ARGUMENT,"standing, but since he had a large income and had fitted out a whole troop"
9019,ARGUMENT,"of cavalry at his own expense, and had borne himself admirably in the very"
9020,ARGUMENT,"first battle, the Emperor had to-day just appointed him a colonel. So the"
9021,ARGUMENT,"Judge greeted the Count and congratulated him on his promotion, but the"
9022,ARGUMENT,"Count paid no attention, and continued to draw diligently."
9023,ARGUMENT,
9024,ARGUMENT,"In the meantime a second betrothed pair had entered. The Assessor, once in"
9025,ARGUMENT,"the service of the Tsar, had entered that of Napoleon; he had a company of"
9026,ARGUMENT,"gendarmes under his command, and, although he had been in office hardly"
9027,ARGUMENT,"twelve hours, he had already donned a dark blue uniform with Polish"
9028,ARGUMENT,"facings, and dragged behind him a curved sabre, and clinked his spurs. By"
9029,ARGUMENT,"his side, with dignified steps, walked his belovèd, dressed with great"
9030,ARGUMENT,"magnificence, Tekla Hreczecha: for the Assessor had long ago abandoned"
9031,ARGUMENT,"Telimena, and, the more deeply to wound that coquette, he had turned his"
9032,ARGUMENT,heart's devotion to the Seneschal's daughter. The bride was not over
9033,ARGUMENT,"young, she had perhaps already seen half a century go by; but she was a"
9034,ARGUMENT,"good housekeeper and a dignified and well-to-do person, for, aside from"
9035,ARGUMENT,"her ancestral village, her dowry had been increased by a little sum"
9036,ARGUMENT,presented to her by the Judge.
9037,ARGUMENT,
9038,ARGUMENT,"For the third pair they waited vainly, a long time. The Judge grew"
9039,ARGUMENT,impatient and sent servants; they returned and reported that the third
9040,ARGUMENT,"bridegroom, the Notary, when looking for the rabbit, had lost his wedding"
9041,ARGUMENT,"ring, and was now looking for it in the meadow; meanwhile the Notary's"
9042,ARGUMENT,"lady was still at her dressing-table, and, though she was herself hurrying"
9043,ARGUMENT,"and was being aided by the serving women, she had been absolutely unable"
9044,ARGUMENT,to finish her toilet: she would scarcely be ready by four o'clock.

9061,ARGUMENT,
9062,ARGUMENT,"FINALLY with a crash the doors of the hall were thrown wide open, and the"
9063,ARGUMENT,"Seneschal entered, wearing a cap, and with his head held high; he did not"
9064,ARGUMENT,"greet the company nor take his place at the table, for to-day the"
9065,ARGUMENT,"Seneschal emerged in a new character, as Marshal of the Court; he bore a"
9066,ARGUMENT,"wand in sign of office, and with this wand he indicated to each in turn"
9067,ARGUMENT,"his place and showed the guests their seats. First of all, as the highest"
9068,ARGUMENT,"in authority in the wojewodeship, the Chamberlain-Marshal took the place"
9069,ARGUMENT,"of honour, a velvet chair with ivory arms; next him on the right sat"
9070,ARGUMENT,"General Dombrowski, and on the left Kniaziewicz, Pac,203 and Malachowski."
9071,ARGUMENT,Amid this company the Chamberlain's wife had her seat; farther on other
9072,ARGUMENT,"ladies, officers, magnates, country gentry, and neighbours, men and women"
9073,ARGUMENT,"alternately, all took places in order as the Seneschal indicated."
9074,ARGUMENT,
9075,ARGUMENT,"The Judge, with a bow, withdrew from the banquet; in the yard he was"
9076,ARGUMENT,"entertaining a throng of peasants, whom he had gathered at a table a"
9077,ARGUMENT,furlong in length; he himself sat at one end and the parish priest at the
9078,ARGUMENT,other. Thaddeus and Sophia did not take seats at the table; being occupied
9079,ARGUMENT,"with serving the peasants, they ate as they walked. Such was the ancient"
9080,ARGUMENT,"custom--that new owners of a farm, at the first feast, should wait on the"
9081,ARGUMENT,common folk.
9082,ARGUMENT,
9083,ARGUMENT,"Meanwhile the guests, as in the castle hall they awaited the bringing in"
9084,ARGUMENT,"of the food, gazed with amazement at the great centrepiece, the metal and"
9085,ARGUMENT,the workmanship of which were equally precious. There is a tradition that
9086,ARGUMENT,"Prince Radziwill the Orphan204 had this set made to order in Venice, and"
9087,ARGUMENT,had it decorated in Polish style according to his own ideas. The
9088,ARGUMENT,"centrepiece had later been carried off in the time of the Swedish wars,205"
9089,ARGUMENT,and had found its way in some mysterious manner into this country
9090,ARGUMENT,gentleman's mansion; to-day it had been brought forth from the treasury
9091,ARGUMENT,"and it now occupied the middle of the table, forming an immense circle,"
9092,ARGUMENT,like a coach wheel.
9093,ARGUMENT,
9094,ARGUMENT,"The centrepiece, which was coated from rim to rim with froth and sugar"
9095,ARGUMENT,"white as snow, counterfeited marvellously well a winter landscape. In the"
9096,ARGUMENT,centre a huge grove of confections showed dark; on the sides were houses
9097,ARGUMENT,"which seemed to form peasant villages and hamlets of gentry, and which"
9098,ARGUMENT,"were coated, not with hoar frost, but with sugary froth; the edges were"
9099,ARGUMENT,decorated with little porcelain figures in Polish costumes: like actors on
9100,ARGUMENT,"a stage, they were evidently representing some striking event; their"
9101,ARGUMENT,"gestures were artistically reproduced, the colours were individual; they"
9102,ARGUMENT,lacked only voice--for the rest they seemed to be alive.
9103,ARGUMENT,
9104,ARGUMENT,"""What is it that they represent?"" asked the curious guests; whereupon the"
9105,ARGUMENT,"Seneschal, raising his wand, spoke as follows (meanwhile brandy was being"
9106,ARGUMENT,"served, in preparation for dinner):--"
9107,ARGUMENT,
9108,ARGUMENT,"""With your permission, honoured gentlemen and guests, those persons whom"
9109,ARGUMENT,you see there in countless numbers represent the progress of a Polish
9110,ARGUMENT,"district diet, its consultations, voting, triumphs, and disputes; I myself"
9111,ARGUMENT,"guessed the meaning of this scene, and I will explain it to the company."
9112,ARGUMENT,
9113,ARGUMENT,"""There on the right may be seen a numerous assembly of gentry: they have"
9114,ARGUMENT,"evidently been invited to a banquet, preceding the diet; the board is"
9115,ARGUMENT,"waiting ready set, but no one is showing the guests their seats; they are"
9116,ARGUMENT,"standing in groups, and each group is deep in discussion. Notice that in"
9117,ARGUMENT,"the centre of each group stands a man from whose parted lips, wide-open"
9118,ARGUMENT,"eyes, and restless hands you may see that he is an orator and is"
9119,ARGUMENT,"expounding something, that he is explaining it with his finger and marking"
9120,ARGUMENT,it on his palm. These orators are recommending their candidates with
9121,ARGUMENT,"various success, as may be seen from the bearing of the brother gentlemen."
9122,ARGUMENT,
9123,ARGUMENT,"""You may be sure that there in the second group the gentry are listening"
9124,ARGUMENT,with attention: this good man has tucked his hands into his belt and has
9125,ARGUMENT,pricked up his ears; that other is holding his hand to his ear and is
9126,ARGUMENT,silently twirling his mustache; he is evidently gathering in the words and
9127,ARGUMENT,storing them up in his memory. The orator takes solid comfort in seeing
9128,ARGUMENT,"that his hearers are converted; he strokes his pocket, for he already has"
9129,ARGUMENT,their votes in his pocket.
9130,ARGUMENT,
9131,ARGUMENT,"""But in the third gathering the situation is quite different: here the"
9132,ARGUMENT,orator must catch his auditors by their belts--notice how they are pulling
9133,ARGUMENT,away and turning aside their ears; notice how this auditor bristles with
9134,ARGUMENT,wrath; he has raised his arms and is threatening the orator and stopping
9135,ARGUMENT,his mouth; he has evidently heard praise showered on his opponent. That
9136,ARGUMENT,other man has bent down his brow like a bull; you might think him about to
9137,ARGUMENT,"toss the orator on his horns. This party are drawing their sabres, and"
9138,ARGUMENT,those others have started to flee.
9139,ARGUMENT,
9140,ARGUMENT,"""One gentleman stands silent and alone between the groups; he is evidently"
9141,ARGUMENT,a non-partisan and is timidly hesitating for whom to give his vote! He
9142,ARGUMENT,"does not know, and is at odds with himself; he leaves it to chance--he has"
9143,ARGUMENT,lifted up his hands and extended his thumbs; with his eyes shut he aims
9144,ARGUMENT,nail against nail; evidently he will trust his vote to fortune; if the
9145,ARGUMENT,"thumbs meet, he will cast an affirmative ballot, but if they miss he will"
9146,ARGUMENT,deposit a negative.
9147,ARGUMENT,
9148,ARGUMENT,"""On the left is another scene, a convent refectory, transformed into the"
9149,ARGUMENT,assembly hall of the gentry. The older men are seated in a row on benches;
9150,ARGUMENT,the younger are standing and looking curiously over their heads towards
9151,ARGUMENT,"the centre; in the centre stands the Marshal, holding the urn in his"
9152,ARGUMENT,"hands; he is counting the balls, and the gentry devour them with their"
9153,ARGUMENT,eyes; he has just shaken out the last one: the Apparitors raise their
9154,ARGUMENT,hands and announce the name of the elected official.
9155,ARGUMENT,
9156,ARGUMENT,"""One gentlemen has no respect for the general concord: see, he has thrust"
9157,ARGUMENT,in his head from the window of the refectory kitchen; see his wide-open
9158,ARGUMENT,"eyes, how insolently he stares; he has opened his mouth as though he"
9159,ARGUMENT,wanted to eat up the whole roomful: it is easy to guess that this
9160,ARGUMENT,gentlemen has shouted  '_Veto!_' See how at that sudden challenge to a
9161,ARGUMENT,quarrel the throng is crowding to the door; they are evidently on their
9162,ARGUMENT,"way to the kitchen; they have drawn their swords, and a bloody fight is"
9163,ARGUMENT,sure to break out.
9164,ARGUMENT,
9165,ARGUMENT,"""But there in the corridor, sirs, pray notice that reverend old priest"
9166,ARGUMENT,advancing in his chasuble; that is the Prior bringing the Host from the
9167,ARGUMENT,"altar, while a boy in a surplice rings a bell and asks all to give way."
9168,ARGUMENT,"The gentry at once sheathe their sabres, cross themselves, and kneel; but"
9169,ARGUMENT,the priest turns in the direction whence a clink of arms is still heard:
9170,ARGUMENT,"soon he will arrive, and at once he will calm and reconcile all."
9171,ARGUMENT,
9172,ARGUMENT,"""Ah, you young men, do not remember this, how among our turbulent,"
9173,ARGUMENT,"self-willed gentry, always under arms though they were, no police were"
9174,ARGUMENT,"ever needed: while the true faith flourished, laws were respected; there"
9175,ARGUMENT,"was liberty with order and glory along with plenty I In other lands, I"
9176,ARGUMENT,"hear, the government maintains soldiers and all sorts of policemen,"
9177,ARGUMENT,"gendarmes, and constables. But if the sword alone guards the public"
9178,ARGUMENT,"security, then I shall never believe that liberty can exist in those"
9179,ARGUMENT,"lands."""
9180,ARGUMENT,
9181,ARGUMENT,"Suddenly, tapping his snuffbox, the Chamberlain said:--"
9182,ARGUMENT,
9183,ARGUMENT,"""Seneschal, I pray you, postpone these stories until later; this diet is a"
9184,ARGUMENT,"curious thing, to be sure, but we are hungry; pray, sir, have them bring"
9185,ARGUMENT,"in the dinner."""
9186,ARGUMENT,
9187,ARGUMENT,"Bending down his wand to the floor, the Seneschal replied:--"
9188,ARGUMENT,
9189,ARGUMENT,"""Your Excellency, pray grant me this indulgence; I will speedily finish"
9190,ARGUMENT,"with the last scene of the district diets. Here is the new Marshal, borne"
9191,ARGUMENT,out of the refectory on the shoulders of his partisans; see how the
9192,ARGUMENT,brother gentlemen are throwing up their caps and standing with open
9193,ARGUMENT,"mouths--vivats! But there on the other side lingers the outvoted candidate,"
9194,ARGUMENT,"all alone, with his cap pulled down over his gloomy brow; his wife is"
9195,ARGUMENT,"waiting in front of her house, and has guessed what is going on. Poor"
9196,ARGUMENT,"woman, now she is fainting in the arms of her maid! Poor woman, she was to"
9197,ARGUMENT,"have received the title of Right Honourable, but now she is left just"
9198,ARGUMENT,"Honourable for three more years!"""
9199,ARGUMENT,
9200,ARGUMENT,"Here the Seneschal concluded his description, and gave a sign with his"
9201,ARGUMENT,"wand; immediately lackeys began to enter in pairs, bringing the different"
9202,ARGUMENT,"dishes: the beet soup called royal, and the old-Polish broth, artistically"
9203,ARGUMENT,"prepared, into which the Seneschal in marvellous and mysterious wise had"
9204,ARGUMENT,thrown several pearls and a piece of money; such broth purifies the blood
9205,ARGUMENT,and fortifies the health; after it came other dishes--but who could
9206,ARGUMENT,"describe them all! Who would even comprehend those dishes of _kontuz,"
9207,ARGUMENT,"arkas_, and _blemas_,206 no longer known in our times, with their"
9208,ARGUMENT,"ingredients of cod, stuffing, civet, musk, caramel, pine nuts, damson"
9209,ARGUMENT,"plums! And those fish! Dry salmon from the Danube, sturgeon, Venetian and"
9210,ARGUMENT,"Turkish caviare, pikes and pickerel a cubit long, flounders, and capon"
9211,ARGUMENT,"carp, and noble carp! Finally a culinary mystery: an uncut fish, fried at"
9212,ARGUMENT,"the head, baked in the middle, and with its tail in a ragout with sauce."
9213,ARGUMENT,
9214,ARGUMENT,"The guests did not ask the names of the dishes, nor were they halted by"
9215,ARGUMENT,that curious mystery; they ate everything rapidly with a soldier's
9216,ARGUMENT,"appetite, filling their glasses with the generous Hungarian wine."
9217,ARGUMENT,
9218,ARGUMENT,"But meanwhile the great centrepiece had changed its colour,207 and,"
9219,ARGUMENT,"stripped of its snow, had already turned green; for the light froth of"
9220,ARGUMENT,"sugared ice, slowly warmed by the summer heat, had melted and disclosed a"
9221,ARGUMENT,foundation hitherto hidden from the eye: so the landscape now represented
9222,ARGUMENT,"a new time of year, shining with a green, many-coloured spring. Various"
9223,ARGUMENT,"grains came forth, as if yeast were making them grow; gilded ears of"
9224,ARGUMENT,"saffron wheat were seen in rich profusion, also rye, clad in leaves of"
9225,ARGUMENT,"picturesque silver, and buckwheat, made artistically of chocolate, and"
9226,ARGUMENT,orchards blooming with pears and apples.
9227,ARGUMENT,
9228,ARGUMENT,The guests had scant time to enjoy the gifts of summer; in vain they
9229,ARGUMENT,"begged the Seneschal to prolong them. Already the centrepiece, like a"
9230,ARGUMENT,"planet in its appointed revolution, was changing the season of the year;"
9231,ARGUMENT,"already the grain, painted with gold, had gathered warmth from the room,"
9232,ARGUMENT,and was slowly melting; already the grasses were growing yellow and the
9233,ARGUMENT,leaves were turning crimson and were falling; you might have said that an
9234,ARGUMENT,"autumn wind was blowing; finally those trees, gorgeous an instant before,"
9235,ARGUMENT,"now stood naked, as if they had been stripped by the winds and the frost;"
9236,ARGUMENT,"they were sticks of cinnamon, or twigs of laurel that counterfeited pines,"
9237,ARGUMENT,being clad in caraway seeds instead of needles.
9238,ARGUMENT,
9239,ARGUMENT,"The guests, as they drank their wine, began to tear off the branches,"
9240,ARGUMENT,"stumps, and roots, and to chew them as a relish. The Seneschal walked"
9241,ARGUMENT,"about the centrepiece, and, full of joy, turned triumphant eyes upon the"
9242,ARGUMENT,guests.
9243,ARGUMENT,
9244,ARGUMENT,"Henryk Dombrowski feigned great amazement, and said:--"
9245,ARGUMENT,
9246,ARGUMENT,"""My friend the Seneschal, are these Chinese shadows? Or has Pinety208"
9247,ARGUMENT,given you his demons as servants? Do such centrepieces still exist among
9248,ARGUMENT,"you, here in Lithuania, and do all men feast in this ancient fashion? Tell"
9249,ARGUMENT,"me, for I have passed my life abroad."""
9250,ARGUMENT,
9251,ARGUMENT,"""No, Your Excellency the General,"" said the Seneschal with a bow, ""these"
9252,ARGUMENT,are no godless arts! This is only a reminder of those famous banquets that
9253,ARGUMENT,"used to be given in the mansions of our ancient magnates, when Poland"
9254,ARGUMENT,enjoyed happiness and power! All that I have done I learned by reading in
9255,ARGUMENT,this book. You ask me whether this custom has been preserved everywhere in
9256,ARGUMENT,"Lithuania. Alas, new fashions are already creeping in even among us! Many"
9257,ARGUMENT,a young gentleman exclaims that he cannot stand the expense; he eats like
9258,ARGUMENT,"a Jew, grudging his guests food and drink; he is stingy with the Hungarian"
9259,ARGUMENT,"wine, and drinks that devilish, adulterated, fashionable Muscovite"
9260,ARGUMENT,champagne; then in the evening he loses as much money at cards as would
9261,ARGUMENT,suffice for a banquet for a hundred gentlemen and brothers. Even--for what
9262,ARGUMENT,I have in my heart I will to-day speak out frankly; let not the
9263,ARGUMENT,Chamberlain take it ill of me--when I was getting that wonderful
9264,ARGUMENT,"centre-*piece from the treasure room, then even the Chamberlain, even he"
9265,ARGUMENT,"made fun of me, saying that this was a tiresome, antiquated"
9266,ARGUMENT,contrivance--that it looked like a child's plaything and was unfit for such
9267,ARGUMENT,"famous men as we have with us to-day! Judge!--even you, Judge, said that it"
9268,ARGUMENT,"would bore the guests! And yet, so far as I may infer from the amazement"
9269,ARGUMENT,"of the company, I see that this is fine art, that it was worthy of being"
9270,ARGUMENT,seen! I doubt whether a like occasion will ever again return for
9271,ARGUMENT,"entertaining at Soplicowo such dignitaries. I see, General, that you are"
9272,ARGUMENT,an expert at banquets; pray accept this book: it will be of use to you
9273,ARGUMENT,"some day when you are giving a feast for a company of foreign monarchs, or"
9274,ARGUMENT,"perhaps one even for Napoleon himself. But permit me, before I tender the"
9275,ARGUMENT,"book to you, to relate by what chance it fell into my hands."""
9276,ARGUMENT,
9277,ARGUMENT,"Suddenly a murmur arose outside the door, and many voices shouted in"
9278,ARGUMENT,"unison, ""Long live Cock-on-the-Steeple!"" A throng pushed into the hall,"
9279,ARGUMENT,with Maciej at their head. The Judge led the guest by the hand to the
9280,ARGUMENT,"table and gave him a high seat among the leaders, saying:--"
9281,ARGUMENT,
9282,ARGUMENT,"""Pan Maciej, unkind neighbour, you come very late, when dinner is almost"
9283,ARGUMENT,"over."""
9284,ARGUMENT,
9285,ARGUMENT,"""I eat early,"" replied Dobrzynski; ""I did not come here for food, but only"
9286,ARGUMENT,because I was overpowered by curiosity to see close at hand our national
9287,ARGUMENT,"army. Of this much might be said; it is neither fish, flesh, nor fowl."
9288,ARGUMENT,"These gentlemen caught sight of me and brought me here by force; and you,"
9289,ARGUMENT,"sir, are compelling me to seat myself at your table--I thank you,"
9290,ARGUMENT,"neighbour."""
9291,ARGUMENT,
9292,ARGUMENT,"With these words he turned his plate bottom upwards, as a sign that he"
9293,ARGUMENT,"would not eat, and relapsed into glum silence."
9294,ARGUMENT,
9295,ARGUMENT,"""Pan Dobrzynski,"" said General Dombrowski to him, ""are you that famous"
9296,ARGUMENT,"swordsman of the Kosciuszko times, that Maciej, called Switch! Your fame"
9297,ARGUMENT,"has reached me. And pray tell me, is it possible that you are still so"
9298,ARGUMENT,"hale, so vigorous! How many years have gone by! See, I have grown old;"
9299,ARGUMENT,"see, Kniaziewicz too has grizzled hair; but you might still enter the"
9300,ARGUMENT,lists against young men. And your switch doubtless blooms as it did long
9301,ARGUMENT,ago; I have heard that recently you birched the Muscovites. But where are
9302,ARGUMENT,your brethren? I should beyond measure like to see those penknives and
9303,ARGUMENT,"razors of yours, the last relics of ancient Lithuania."""
9304,ARGUMENT,
9305,ARGUMENT,"""After that victory, General,"" said the Judge, ""almost all the Dobrzynskis"
9306,ARGUMENT,"took refuge in the Grand Duchy, and must have entered one or other of the"
9307,ARGUMENT,"legions."""
9308,ARGUMENT,
9309,ARGUMENT,"""Why certainly,"" answered a young squadron commander, ""I have in the"
9310,ARGUMENT,"second company a mustachioed scarecrow, Sergeant-Major Dobrzynski, who"
9311,ARGUMENT,"calls himself Sprinkler, but whom the Masovians call the Lithuanian bear."
9312,ARGUMENT,"If you bid me, General, we will have him brought in."""
9313,ARGUMENT,
9314,ARGUMENT,"""There are several other natives of Lithuania here,"" said a lieutenant."
9315,ARGUMENT,"""One such soldier is known under the name of Razor; another carries a"
9316,ARGUMENT,blunderbuss and rides with the sharp-shooters; there are likewise two
9317,ARGUMENT,"grenadiers named Dobrzynski in the chasseur regiment."""
9318,ARGUMENT,
9319,ARGUMENT,"""Well, but I want to know about their chief,"" said the General, ""about"
9320,ARGUMENT,"that Penknife of whom the Seneschal has told me so many marvels, worthy of"
9321,ARGUMENT,"one of the giants of old times."""
9322,ARGUMENT,
9323,ARGUMENT,"""Penknife,"" said the Seneschal, ""though he did not go into exile,"
9324,ARGUMENT,"nevertheless feared the result of an investigation, and hid himself from"
9325,ARGUMENT,"the Muscovites; all winter the poor fellow roamed about the forests, and"
9326,ARGUMENT,he has only recently come forth from them. In these times of war he might
9327,ARGUMENT,"have been good for something, for he is a valorous man, only he is"
9328,ARGUMENT,"unfortunately a trifle bowed by age. But here he is."""
9329,ARGUMENT,
9330,ARGUMENT,"Here the Seneschal pointed towards the vestibule, where servants and"
9331,ARGUMENT,peasants were standing crowded together. Above the heads of all a shining
9332,ARGUMENT,bald pate showed itself suddenly like the full moon; thrice it emerged and
9333,ARGUMENT,thrice it vanished in the cloud of heads; the Warden was bowing as he
9334,ARGUMENT,"strode forward, until finally he made his way out of the press, and said:--"
9335,ARGUMENT,
9336,ARGUMENT,"""Your Excellency the Hetman of the Crown--or General--never mind which is"
9337,ARGUMENT,"the correct title--I am Rembajlo, and I present myself at your summons with"
9338,ARGUMENT,"this my penknife, which, not by its setting nor by its inscriptions but by"
9339,ARGUMENT,"its temper, has won such fame that even Your Excellency knows of it. If it"
9340,ARGUMENT,"knew how to speak, perchance it would say somewhat in praise even of this"
9341,ARGUMENT,"old arm, which, thank God, has served long and faithfully the Fatherland"
9342,ARGUMENT,and likewise the family of the Horeszkos: of which fact the memory is
9343,ARGUMENT,"still famous among men. My boy, rarely does a bookkeeper on an estate mend"
9344,ARGUMENT,pens so deftly as this penknife cleaves heads: it were long to count them!
9345,ARGUMENT,"And noses and ears without number! But there is not a single nick upon it,"
9346,ARGUMENT,"and no murderous deed has ever stained it, but only open war, or a duel."
9347,ARGUMENT,"Only once!--may the Lord give him eternal rest!--an unarmed man, alas, fell"
9348,ARGUMENT,"beneath its edge! But even that, God is my witness, was _pro publico"
9349,ARGUMENT,"bono_."""
9350,ARGUMENT,
9351,ARGUMENT,"""Show it to me,"" said General Dombrowski with a laugh. ""That is a lovely"
9352,ARGUMENT,"penknife, a real headsman's sword!"""
9353,ARGUMENT,
9354,ARGUMENT,"He gazed with amazement on the huge blade, and passed it on to the other"
9355,ARGUMENT,"officers; all of them tried it, but hardly one of the officers could lift"
9356,ARGUMENT,"that blade on high. They said that Dembinski,209 famous for his strength"
9357,ARGUMENT,"of arm, could have brandished the broadsword, but he was not there. Of"
9358,ARGUMENT,"those present only the squadron commander Dwernicki,210 and Lieutenant"
9359,ARGUMENT,"Rozycki,211 the leader of a platoon, managed to swing the iron pole: thus"
9360,ARGUMENT,the blade was passed for trial from hand to hand along the line.
9361,ARGUMENT,
9362,ARGUMENT,"But General Kniaziewicz, the tallest of stature, proved to be also the"
9363,ARGUMENT,"stoutest of arm. Seizing the huge blade, he swung it as lightly as a"
9364,ARGUMENT,"common sword and flashed it like lightning over the heads of the guests,"
9365,ARGUMENT,"recalling to their minds the tricks of the Polish school of fencing, the"
9366,ARGUMENT,"_cross stroke_, the _mill_, the _crooked slash_, the _downright blow_, the"
9367,ARGUMENT,"_stolen slash_, and the attitudes of _counterpoint_212 and _tierce_, which"
9368,ARGUMENT,"he knew likewise, for he had been trained in the School of Cadets."
9369,ARGUMENT,
9370,ARGUMENT,"While he was still laughing and fencing, Rembajlo had kneeled and embraced"
9371,ARGUMENT,"him about the knees, and was groaning out between his tears, at every turn"
9372,ARGUMENT,of the sword:--
9373,ARGUMENT,
9374,ARGUMENT,"""Beautiful! General, were you ever a confederate? Beautiful, splendid!"
9375,ARGUMENT,That is the Pulawskis'213 thrust! Thus Dzierzanowski214 bore himself! That
9376,ARGUMENT,is Sawa's thrust! Who can so have trained your arm except Maciej
9377,ARGUMENT,"Dobrzynski! But that? General, that is my invention; in Heaven's name, I"
9378,ARGUMENT,"do not wish to boast, but that stroke is known only in Rembajlo hamlet,"
9379,ARGUMENT,and from my name it is called _My-boy's slash_. Who can have taught it to
9380,ARGUMENT,"you? That is my stroke, mine!"""
9381,ARGUMENT,
9382,ARGUMENT,He rose and clasped the General in his arms.
9383,ARGUMENT,
9384,ARGUMENT,"""Now I can die in peace! There still exists a man who will fondle my"
9385,ARGUMENT,"darling child; for I have long been grieving, both day and night, at the"
9386,ARGUMENT,thought that after my death this my blade might rust away! Now it will not
9387,ARGUMENT,"rust! Your Excellency the General, forgive me!--throw away those spits,"
9388,ARGUMENT,those German swordlets; it is shameful for a gentleman's son to wear that
9389,ARGUMENT,little cane! Take instead a sabre such as befits a gentleman: now I lay at
9390,ARGUMENT,"your feet this my penknife, which is the most precious thing that I"
9391,ARGUMENT,"possess in all the world. I have never had a wife, I have never had a"
9392,ARGUMENT,child: it has been both wife and child to me; from my embrace it has never
9393,ARGUMENT,departed; from dawn till dark have I petted it; it has slept by night at
9394,ARGUMENT,"my side! And since I have grown old, it has been hanging on the wall above"
9395,ARGUMENT,"my couch, like God's commandments over the Jews! I thought to have it"
9396,ARGUMENT,buried in my grave along with my arm; but I have found an owner for it.
9397,ARGUMENT,"May it be your servant!"""
9398,ARGUMENT,
9399,ARGUMENT,"The General, half laughing, and half touched with emotion, replied:--"
9400,ARGUMENT,
9401,ARGUMENT,"""Comrade, if you give up to me your wife and child, you will be left for"
9402,ARGUMENT,"the rest of your life very solitary and old, a widower and without"
9403,ARGUMENT,"children! Tell me how I may recompense you for this precious gift, and"
9404,ARGUMENT,"with what I may sweeten your childless widowhood!"""
9405,ARGUMENT,
9406,ARGUMENT,"""Am I Cybulski,""215 answered the Warden mournfully, ""who gambled away his"
9407,ARGUMENT,"wife, playing marriage with the Muscovites, as the song relates?--I am"
9408,ARGUMENT,quite content that my penknife will still gleam before the world in such a
9409,ARGUMENT,"hand. Only remember, General, to give it a long strap, well let out, for"
9410,ARGUMENT,the blade is long; and always hew from the left ear with both hands--then
9411,ARGUMENT,"you will cut through from head to belly."""
9412,ARGUMENT,
9413,ARGUMENT,"The General took the penknife, but since it was very long and he could not"
9414,ARGUMENT,"wear it, the servants put it away in an ammunition waggon. As to what"
9415,ARGUMENT,"became of it there are various tales, but no one knew with certainty,"
9416,ARGUMENT,either then or later.
9417,ARGUMENT,
9418,ARGUMENT,Dombrowski turned to Maciek:--
9419,ARGUMENT,
9420,ARGUMENT,"""What have you to say, comrade? Can it be that you are not glad at our"
9421,ARGUMENT,coming? Why are you silent and glum? How can your heart help leaping up
9422,ARGUMENT,"when you see the gold and silver eagles, and when the trumpeters trumpet"
9423,ARGUMENT,"Kosciuszko's reveille close to your ear? Maciek, I thought that you were"
9424,ARGUMENT,more of a fighting man: if you do not seize your sabre and mount your
9425,ARGUMENT,"horse, at least you will gaily drink with your colleagues to the health of"
9426,ARGUMENT,"Napoleon and the hopes of Poland!"""
9427,ARGUMENT,
9428,ARGUMENT,"""Ha!"" said Maciej, ""I have heard and I see what is going on! But, sir, two"
9429,ARGUMENT,"eagles never nest together! Lords' favour, hetman, rides a piebald"
9430,ARGUMENT,steed!216 The Emperor a great hero! On that subject we could expend much
9431,ARGUMENT,"talk! I remember that my friends the Pulawskis used to say, as they gazed"
9432,ARGUMENT,"on Dumouriez,217 that Poland needed a Polish hero, no Frenchman or Italian"
9433,ARGUMENT,"either, but a Piast,218 a Jan or a Jozef, or a Maciek--that's all. The"
9434,ARGUMENT,"army! They say it is Polish! But these _fusileers, sappers, grenadiers_,"
9435,ARGUMENT,"and _cannoneers!_ You hear, in that crowd, more German than native"
9436,ARGUMENT,titles!219 Who can understand them! And then you must certainly have with
9437,ARGUMENT,"you Turks or Tatars or Schismatics, or men of God knows what faith: I have"
9438,ARGUMENT,"seen it myself; they are assaulting the peasant women in the villages,"
9439,ARGUMENT,"plundering the passers-by, pillaging the churches! The Emperor is bound"
9440,ARGUMENT,for Moscow! That is a long road if he has set out without the blessing of
9441,ARGUMENT,God. I have heard that he has already incurred the bishop's curse;220 all
9442,ARGUMENT,"this is----"""
9443,ARGUMENT,
9444,ARGUMENT,"Here Maciej dipped some bread in his soup, munched it, and did not finish"
9445,ARGUMENT,his last phrase.
9446,ARGUMENT,
9447,ARGUMENT,"Maciek's speech did not suit the taste of the Chamberlain, and the young"
9448,ARGUMENT,"men began to murmur; the Judge interrupted the wrangling, by announcing"
9449,ARGUMENT,the arrival of the third betrothed couple.
9450,ARGUMENT,
9451,ARGUMENT,"It was the Notary; he announced himself as the Notary, but nobody"
9452,ARGUMENT,"recognised him. He had hitherto worn the Polish costume, but now his"
9453,ARGUMENT,"future wife, Telimena, had forced him by a clause in the marriage articles"
9454,ARGUMENT,to renounce the kontusz;221 so the Notary willy-nilly had assumed French
9455,ARGUMENT,garb. The dress coat had evidently deprived him of half his soul; he
9456,ARGUMENT,"strode along as if he had swallowed a walking-stick, stiffly and straight"
9457,ARGUMENT,"forward; like a crane, he dared not look to the right or the left. His"
9458,ARGUMENT,"expression was composed, and yet from his expression one could see that he"
9459,ARGUMENT,"was in torture; he did not know how to bow or where to put his hands, he,"
9460,ARGUMENT,who was so fond of gestures! He tucked his hands into his belt--there was
9461,ARGUMENT,no belt--he only stroked himself self on the stomach; he noticed his
9462,ARGUMENT,"mistake, was greatly confused, turned red as a lobster, and hid both his"
9463,ARGUMENT,hands in the same pocket of his dress coat. He advanced as if running the
9464,ARGUMENT,"gauntlet, amid whispers and banter, feeling as ashamed of his dress coat"
9465,ARGUMENT,"as of a dishonourable deed; at last he met the eyes of Maciek, and"
9466,ARGUMENT,trembled with fright.
9467,ARGUMENT,
9468,ARGUMENT,Maciej had hitherto lived on very friendly terms with the Notary; but now
9469,ARGUMENT,he turned on him so sharp and furious a glance that the Notary grew pale
9470,ARGUMENT,"and began to button his coat, thinking that Maciej would tear it off him"
9471,ARGUMENT,"with his glance. Dobrzynski merely repeated twice over in a loud voice,"
9472,ARGUMENT,"""Idiot!"" and was so fearfully disgusted with the Notary's change of garb"
9473,ARGUMENT,"that he at once rose from the table; slipping out without saying good-bye,"
9474,ARGUMENT,he mounted his horse and returned to the hamlet.
9475,ARGUMENT,
9476,ARGUMENT,"But meanwhile the Notary's fair sweetheart, Telimena, was spreading abroad"
9477,ARGUMENT,"the gleams of her beauty and of her toilet, from top to toe of the very"
9478,ARGUMENT,"latest style. What manner of gown she wore, and what her coiffure was"
9479,ARGUMENT,"like, it were vain to write, for the pen could never express it; only the"
9480,ARGUMENT,"pencil could portray those tulles, muslins, laces, cashmeres, pearls and"
9481,ARGUMENT,precious stones--and her rosy cheeks and lively glances!
9482,ARGUMENT,
9483,ARGUMENT,"The Count at once recognised her, and, pale with astonishment, rose from"
9484,ARGUMENT,the table and looked about him for his sword.
9485,ARGUMENT,
9486,ARGUMENT,"""And is it thou!"" he cried, ""or do my eyes deceive me? Thou? In my"
9487,ARGUMENT,"presence? Dost clasp another's hand? O faithless being, O traitorous soul!"
9488,ARGUMENT,And dost thou not hide thy face for shame beneath the earth? Art thou so
9489,ARGUMENT,"unmindful of thy vows so lately made? Ah, man of easy faith! Why have I"
9490,ARGUMENT,worn these ribbons! But woe to the rival who so contemns me! Only across
9491,ARGUMENT,"my body shall he advance to the altar!"""
9492,ARGUMENT,
9493,ARGUMENT,The guests arose; the Notary was in frightful distress; the Chamberlain
9494,ARGUMENT,"was making hurried efforts to reconcile the rivals, but Telimena, taking"
9495,ARGUMENT,"the Count aside, whispered to him:--"
9496,ARGUMENT,
9497,ARGUMENT,"""The Notary has not yet taken me as his wife: if you have anything against"
9498,ARGUMENT,"his doing so, answer me this, and answer me right off, short and to the"
9499,ARGUMENT,"point: do you love me, have you not yet changed your affections, are you"
9500,ARGUMENT,"ready to marry me right off; right off, to-day? If you agree, I will give"
9501,ARGUMENT,"up the Notary."""
9502,ARGUMENT,
9503,ARGUMENT,"""O woman beyond my comprehension!"" said the Count, ""formerly in thy"
9504,ARGUMENT,feelings thou wast poetic; but now thou seemest altogether prosaic. What
9505,ARGUMENT,are your marriages except chains that bind only the hands and not the
9506,ARGUMENT,"spirit? Believe me, there are proffers of love even without an avowal of"
9507,ARGUMENT,"it, and there are duties even without an engagement! Two burning hearts at"
9508,ARGUMENT,the two ends of the earth converse together like stars with trembling
9509,ARGUMENT,beams. Who knows? Perhaps for this very reason the earth so aspires
9510,ARGUMENT,"towards the sun, and is thus ever dear to the moon--that they gaze upon"
9511,ARGUMENT,"each other eternally, and run towards each other by the shortest path, but"
9512,ARGUMENT,"can never draw near to each other!"""
9513,ARGUMENT,
9514,ARGUMENT,"""Enough of that,"" she interrupted; ""by the grace of God I am no planet,"
9515,ARGUMENT,"Count! Enough, Count, I am a woman. I know what's coming; make an end to"
9516,ARGUMENT,all this chatter. Now I warn you; if you utter one word to break off my
9517,ARGUMENT,"marriage, then, as God is in Heaven, I will jump at you with these nails"
9518,ARGUMENT,"and----"""
9519,ARGUMENT,
9520,ARGUMENT,"""I will not disturb your happiness, madam,"" said the Count, and he turned"
9521,ARGUMENT,"away his eyes, full of grief and contempt; and, in order to punish his"
9522,ARGUMENT,"faithless sweetheart, he chose the Chamberlain's daughter as the object of"
9523,ARGUMENT,his constant flames.
9524,ARGUMENT,
9525,ARGUMENT,The Seneschal was eager to make peace between the estranged young men by
9526,ARGUMENT,"citing wise examples, so he began to recount the story of the wild boar of"
9527,ARGUMENT,"the forests of Naliboki, and of the quarrel between Rejtan and the Prince"
9528,ARGUMENT,de Nassau;222 but meanwhile the guests had finished eating their ices and
9529,ARGUMENT,"were going outside the castle into the yard, to enjoy the fresh air."
9530,ARGUMENT,
9531,ARGUMENT,"There the peasantry were just finishing their banquet, and pitchers of"
9532,ARGUMENT,mead were going the rounds; the musicians were already tuning their
9533,ARGUMENT,"instruments and summoning people to dance. They looked for Thaddeus, who"
9534,ARGUMENT,was standing some distance away and whispering something of pressing
9535,ARGUMENT,moment to his future wife:--
9536,ARGUMENT,
9537,ARGUMENT,"""Sophia, I must take counsel with you in a very important matter; I have"
9538,ARGUMENT,"already asked my uncle's opinion, and he is not opposed. You know that a"
9539,ARGUMENT,"considerable portion of the villages that I am to be the owner of,"
9540,ARGUMENT,according to the law ought to have descended to you. These serfs are not
9541,ARGUMENT,"my subjects, but yours; I should not venture to dispose of their affairs"
9542,ARGUMENT,"without the consent of their lady. Now, when we ourselves possess once"
9543,ARGUMENT,"more our beloved Fatherland, shall the peasants by that happy change gain"
9544,ARGUMENT,"only this much, that they receive another lord? To be sure, they have"
9545,ARGUMENT,"hitherto been governed with kindness, but after my death God knows to whom"
9546,ARGUMENT,"I may leave them; I am a soldier, and we both are mortal; I am a man, and"
9547,ARGUMENT,I fear my own caprices: I shall act with greater security if I renounce my
9548,ARGUMENT,own authority and give over the fate of the villagers into the protection
9549,ARGUMENT,"of the law. Being free ourselves, let us make the villagers free likewise;"
9550,ARGUMENT,let us grant them as their own the possession of the land on which they
9551,ARGUMENT,"were born, which they have gained by bloody toil, and from which they"
9552,ARGUMENT,nourish us all and make us all rich. But I must warn you that the grant of
9553,ARGUMENT,these lands will lessen our income; we must live in moderate
9554,ARGUMENT,"circumstances. I from my youth am wonted to a frugal life; but you,"
9555,ARGUMENT,"Sophia, spring from a mighty line, and have passed your early years in the"
9556,ARGUMENT,"capital--will you consent to live in a village, far from the great world,"
9557,ARGUMENT,"like a country girl?"""
9558,ARGUMENT,
9559,ARGUMENT,"In reply Zosia said modestly,--"
9560,ARGUMENT,
9561,ARGUMENT,"""I am a woman, authority does not belong to me. You will be my husband; I"
9562,ARGUMENT,"am too young to give advice--whatever you arrange, I agree to with all my"
9563,ARGUMENT,"heart! If by freeing the villagers you become poorer, then, Thaddeus, you"
9564,ARGUMENT,"will be all the dearer to my heart. Of my family I know little, and to it"
9565,ARGUMENT,"I am quite indifferent; I remember only that I was poor and an orphan, and"
9566,ARGUMENT,"that I was taken in as a daughter by the Soplicas, that I was brought up"
9567,ARGUMENT,in their house and married from it. Of the country I am not afraid: if I
9568,ARGUMENT,"have lived in a great city, that was long ago; I have forgotten it, and"
9569,ARGUMENT,"have always loved the country. Believe me, that my hens and roosters have"
9570,ARGUMENT,"given me more amusement than all those St. Petersburgs, If at times I have"
9571,ARGUMENT,"longed for amusement and for society, that was from childishness; I know"
9572,ARGUMENT,"now that the city wearies me. I convinced myself last winter, after a"
9573,ARGUMENT,"short stay in Wilno, that I was born for a country life; in the midst of"
9574,ARGUMENT,"gaieties I longed once more for Soplicowo. And I am not afraid of work,"
9575,ARGUMENT,for I am young and strong; I know how to walk about the place and wear a
9576,ARGUMENT,bunch of keys: you will see how quickly I shall learn how to manage the
9577,ARGUMENT,"household!"""
9578,ARGUMENT,
9579,ARGUMENT,"While Zosia was speaking these last words, Gerwazy came up to her, amazed"
9580,ARGUMENT,and glum.
9581,ARGUMENT,
9582,ARGUMENT,"""I know it already,"" he said, ""the Judge has already been speaking of this"
9583,ARGUMENT,liberty! But I do not understand what that has to do with peasants! I am
9584,ARGUMENT,"afraid that there may be something a trifle German in this! Why, liberty"
9585,ARGUMENT,"is not a peasant's affair, but a gentleman's! To be sure, we are all"
9586,ARGUMENT,"derived from Adam, but I have heard that the peasants proceed from Ham,223"
9587,ARGUMENT,"the Jews from Japhet, and we gentry from Shem; hence we are lords over"
9588,ARGUMENT,"both, as the elder brothers. But now the parish priest gives us different"
9589,ARGUMENT,teaching from the pulpit--he says that so it was under the old law; but
9590,ARGUMENT,"that when once Christ our Lord, though he sprang from the blood of kings,"
9591,ARGUMENT,"was born among Jews in a peasant's stable, from that time on he has made"
9592,ARGUMENT,"equal all classes of men and brought in peace among them. Well, so be it,"
9593,ARGUMENT,"since it can't be otherwise! Especially if, as I hear, Your Excellency my"
9594,ARGUMENT,Lady Sophia has agreed to everything; it is for you to give orders and for
9595,ARGUMENT,me to obey them: authority belongs to you alone. Only I warn you that we
9596,ARGUMENT,"must not grant merely an empty liberty, in words alone, like that under"
9597,ARGUMENT,"the Muscovites, when the late Pan Karp freed his serfs and the Muscovite"
9598,ARGUMENT,starved them to death with a triple tax.224 So it is my advice that
9599,ARGUMENT,according to the ancient custom we make the peasants nobles and proclaim
9600,ARGUMENT,"that we bestow on them our own coats of arms. You, my lady, will bestow on"
9601,ARGUMENT,some villages the Half-Goat; to others let Pan Soplica give his Star and
9602,ARGUMENT,"Crescent.225 Then will even Rembajlo recognize the peasant as his equal,"
9603,ARGUMENT,"when he beholds him an honourable gentleman, with a coat of arms. The Diet"
9604,ARGUMENT,will confirm the act.
9605,ARGUMENT,
9606,ARGUMENT,"""But, sir, do not make anxious your lady wife by saying that the giving up"
9607,ARGUMENT,of the lands will make you both so extremely poor; God forbid that I
9608,ARGUMENT,should see the hands of a dignitary's daughter hardened with housewifely
9609,ARGUMENT,labour. There is a way of preventing this: in the castle I know of a
9610,ARGUMENT,certain chest in which lies the table service of the Horeszkos and with it
9611,ARGUMENT,"various rings, necklaces, bracelets, rich plumes, caparisons, and"
9612,ARGUMENT,"marvellous swords--the Pantler's treasures, hidden from plunderers, in the"
9613,ARGUMENT,"ground; to Pani Sophia, as his heiress, they belong; I have guarded them"
9614,ARGUMENT,"in the castle like the eyes in my head, keeping them from the Muscovites,"
9615,ARGUMENT,"and from you, my Soplica friends. I have likewise a good-sized pouch of my"
9616,ARGUMENT,"own thalers, saved from my earnings, and likewise from the gifts of my"
9617,ARGUMENT,"masters; I had intended, when the castle should be returned to us, to"
9618,ARGUMENT,devote some pennies to the repairing of the walls--to-day it turns out that
9619,ARGUMENT,"they will be needed for the new style of farming. And so, Pan Soplica, I"
9620,ARGUMENT,"am moving to your abode; I shall live with my lady, on her bounty, and"
9621,ARGUMENT,shall rock to sleep a third generation of Horeszkos; I will train my
9622,ARGUMENT,"lady's child to use the penknife, if it is a son--and she will have a son,"
9623,ARGUMENT,"for wars are coming on, and in time of war sons are always born."""
9624,ARGUMENT,
9625,ARGUMENT,"Hardly had Gerwazy spoken these last words, when Protazy approached with"
9626,ARGUMENT,"dignified steps; he bowed, and took from the bosom of his kontusz a huge"
9627,ARGUMENT,"panegyric, two and a half sheets long.226 It had been composed in rime by"
9628,ARGUMENT,"a young subaltern, who once had been a famous writer of odes in the"
9629,ARGUMENT,"capital; he had later donned a uniform, but, retaining even in the army"
9630,ARGUMENT,"his devotion to letters, he still continued to make verses. The Apparitor"
9631,ARGUMENT,"read aloud full three hundred of them; at last, when he came to the"
9632,ARGUMENT,place:--
9633,ARGUMENT,
9634,ARGUMENT,Thou whose fair eyes
9635,ARGUMENT,Rouse in us painful joys and blissful sighs;
9636,ARGUMENT,"When on Bellona's ranks thy glance descends,"
9637,ARGUMENT,All spears are broken and each buckler bends:
9638,ARGUMENT,To-day soft Hymen conquers cruel Mars;
9639,ARGUMENT,Thy gentle hand the hissing serpents tears                 }
9640,ARGUMENT,"From Discord's hydra front, emblem of dreadful wars-- }"
9641,ARGUMENT,
9642,ARGUMENT,"Thaddeus and Sophia began to clap vigorously, as if in applause, but"
9643,ARGUMENT,really because they did not wish to hear further. Now at the Judge's
9644,ARGUMENT,bidding the parish priest mounted the table and proclaimed Thaddeus's
9645,ARGUMENT,determination to the villagers.
9646,ARGUMENT,
9647,ARGUMENT,"Hardly had the peasants heard this news, when they leapt towards their"
9648,ARGUMENT,"young master and fell at the feet of their lady. ""The health of our"
9649,ARGUMENT,"masters!"" they shouted with tears, and Thaddeus shouted, ""The health of"
9650,ARGUMENT,"our fellow citizens, free Poles, our equals!"" ""I propose the health of the"
9651,ARGUMENT,"common people!"" said Dombrowski--the people shouted: ""Long live the"
9652,ARGUMENT,"generals, vivat the army, vivat the people, vivat all classes!"" With a"
9653,ARGUMENT,"thousand voices, one health thundered after another."
9654,ARGUMENT,
9655,ARGUMENT,Buchmann alone did not deign to share in the general joy; he praised the
9656,ARGUMENT,"project, but would have preferred to change it slightly, and first of all"
9657,ARGUMENT,"to appoint a legal commission, which should--but the shortness of the time"
9658,ARGUMENT,"prevented them from adopting Buchmann's advice, for in the yard of the"
9659,ARGUMENT,"castle the officers and ladies, the privates and the village girls were"
9660,ARGUMENT,"already standing in couples: ""the polonaise!"" they all shouted with one"
9661,ARGUMENT,"breath. The officers were bringing up the army musicians, but the Judge"
9662,ARGUMENT,whispered in the General's ear:--
9663,ARGUMENT,
9664,ARGUMENT,"""Pray give orders for the band to restrain itself for a while longer. You"
9665,ARGUMENT,"know that to-day sees the betrothal of my nephew, and it is the ancient"
9666,ARGUMENT,custom of our family to celebrate betrothals and marriages with village
9667,ARGUMENT,"music. Look, there stand the player of the dulcimer, the fiddler, and the"
9668,ARGUMENT,"bagpiper, all worthy musicians--already the fiddler is making mouths, and"
9669,ARGUMENT,the bagpiper is bowing and begging with his eyes that I will have them
9670,ARGUMENT,begin--the poor fellows will weep. The common folk will not know how to
9671,ARGUMENT,skip to other music; so let them begin and let the folk have their fun;
9672,ARGUMENT,"afterwards we will listen to your excellent band."""
9673,ARGUMENT,
9674,ARGUMENT,"He made a sign. The fiddler tucked up the sleeve of his coat, squeezed"
9675,ARGUMENT,"tightly the finger board, rested his chin on the tailpiece, and sent his"
9676,ARGUMENT,"bow over the fiddle like a race horse. At this signal, the bagpipers, who"
9677,ARGUMENT,"were standing close by, blew into their sacks and filled their cheeks with"
9678,ARGUMENT,"breath, making a quick motion with their arms as though flapping their"
9679,ARGUMENT,"wings; you might have thought that the pair would fly off on the breeze,"
9680,ARGUMENT,like the chubby children of Boreas. But there was no dulcimer.
9681,ARGUMENT,
9682,ARGUMENT,"There were many players of the dulcimer, but none of them dared to perform"
9683,ARGUMENT,in Jankiel's presence. (Jankiel had been spending the whole winter no one
9684,ARGUMENT,knows where; now he had suddenly made his appearance along with the
9685,ARGUMENT,General Staff.) Everybody knew that no one could compare with him in
9686,ARGUMENT,"playing that instrument, either in skill, taste, or talent. They begged"
9687,ARGUMENT,"him to play and offered him the dulcimer; the Jew refused, saying that his"
9688,ARGUMENT,"hands had grown stiff, that he was out of practice, that he did not dare"
9689,ARGUMENT,"to, that he was embarrassed by the men of high station; with many a bow he"
9690,ARGUMENT,"was stealing away. When Zosia saw this, she ran up, and with one white"
9691,ARGUMENT,hand proffered him the hammers with which the master was wont to sound the
9692,ARGUMENT,"strings; with the other hand she stroked the old man's grey beard, and"
9693,ARGUMENT,said with a curtsy:--
9694,ARGUMENT,
9695,ARGUMENT,"""Jankiel, be so good; you see this is my betrothal; play for me, Jankiel."
9696,ARGUMENT,"Haven't you often promised to play at my wedding?"""
9697,ARGUMENT,
9698,ARGUMENT,"Jankiel, who was beyond measure fond of Zosia, nodded his beard as a sign"
9699,ARGUMENT,that he did not refuse. So they led him into the centre of the company and
9700,ARGUMENT,"put his instrument on his knees; he gazed on it with delight and pride,"
9701,ARGUMENT,"like a veteran called back to active service, when his grandsons take down"
9702,ARGUMENT,"from the wall his heavy sword: the old man laughs, though it is long since"
9703,ARGUMENT,"he has had a sword in his hand, for he feels that his hand will not yet"
9704,ARGUMENT,betray the weapon.
9705,ARGUMENT,
9706,ARGUMENT,"Meanwhile two of his pupils were kneeling by the dulcimer, tuning the"
9707,ARGUMENT,strings afresh and twanging them as a test of their work. Jankiel with
9708,ARGUMENT,half-closed eyes sat silent and held the hammers motionless in his
9709,ARGUMENT,fingers.
9710,ARGUMENT,
9711,ARGUMENT,"He lowered them, at first beating a triumphal measure; then he smote the"
9712,ARGUMENT,"strings more briskly, as with a torrent of rain: all were amazed, but that"
9713,ARGUMENT,"was only a test, for he suddenly broke off and lifted both hammers aloft."
9714,ARGUMENT,
9715,ARGUMENT,He played anew; now the strings trembled with motions as light as though
9716,ARGUMENT,"the wing of a fly were sounding on the string, giving forth a gentle,"
9717,ARGUMENT,"hardly audible buzzing. The master fixed his gaze on the sky, awaiting"
9718,ARGUMENT,inspiration; he looked down and surveyed the instrument with a haughty
9719,ARGUMENT,"eye, he raised his hands and lowered them together, and smote with both"
9720,ARGUMENT,hammers at once; the auditors were amazed.--
9721,ARGUMENT,
9722,ARGUMENT,All at once from many strings there burst forth a sound as though a whole
9723,ARGUMENT,janissaries' band had become vocal with bells and cymbals and drums.227
9724,ARGUMENT,The  _Polonaise of the Third of May_228 thundered forth! The rippling
9725,ARGUMENT,"notes breathed of joy, they poured joy into one's ears; the girls wanted"
9726,ARGUMENT,to dance and the boys could not stand still--but the notes carried the
9727,ARGUMENT,"thoughts of the old men back into the past, to those happy years when the"
9728,ARGUMENT,"Senate and the House of Deputies, after that great day of the Third of"
9729,ARGUMENT,"May, celebrated in the assembly hall the reconciliation of King and"
9730,ARGUMENT,"Nation; when they danced and sang, ""Vivat our beloved King, vivat the"
9731,ARGUMENT,"Diet, vivat the people, vivat all classes!"""
9732,ARGUMENT,
9733,ARGUMENT,"The master kept quickening the time and playing with greater power, but"
9734,ARGUMENT,"suddenly he struck a false chord like the hiss of a snake, like the"
9735,ARGUMENT,"grating of iron on glass--it sent a shudder through every one, and mingled"
9736,ARGUMENT,"with the general gaiety an ill-omened foreboding. Disturbed and alarmed,"
9737,ARGUMENT,"the hearers wondered whether the instrument might not be out of tune, or"
9738,ARGUMENT,the musician be making a blunder. Such a master had not blundered! He
9739,ARGUMENT,"purposely kept touching that traitorous string and breaking up the melody,"
9740,ARGUMENT,"striking louder and louder that angry chord, confederated against the"
9741,ARGUMENT,"harmony of the tones; at last the Warden understood the master, covered"
9742,ARGUMENT,"his face in his hands, and cried, ""I know, I know those notes; that is"
9743,ARGUMENT,"_Targowica!_"" And suddenly the ill-omened string broke with a hiss; the"
9744,ARGUMENT,"musician rushed to the treble notes, broke up and confused the measure,"
9745,ARGUMENT,"abandoned the treble notes, and hurried his hammers to the bass strings."
9746,ARGUMENT,
9747,ARGUMENT,"One could hear louder and louder a thousand noises, measured marching,"
9748,ARGUMENT,"war, an attack, a storm; one could hear the reports of guns, the groans of"
9749,ARGUMENT,"children, the weeping of mothers. So finely did the wonderful master"
9750,ARGUMENT,"render the horrors of a storm that the village girls trembled, calling to"
9751,ARGUMENT,"mind with tears of grief the Massacre of Praga,229 which they knew from"
9752,ARGUMENT,song and story; they were glad when finally the master thundered with all
9753,ARGUMENT,"the strings at once, and choked the outcries as though he had crushed them"
9754,ARGUMENT,into the earth.
9755,ARGUMENT,
9756,ARGUMENT,"Hardly did the hearers have time to recover from their amazement, when"
9757,ARGUMENT,once more the music changed: at first there were once more light and
9758,ARGUMENT,"gentle hummings; a few thin strings complained together, like flies"
9759,ARGUMENT,striving to free themselves from the spider's web. But more and more
9760,ARGUMENT,strings joined them; now the scattered tones were blended and legions of
9761,ARGUMENT,"chords were united; now they advanced measuredly with harmonious notes,"
9762,ARGUMENT,forming the mourrlful melody of that famous song of the wandering soldier
9763,ARGUMENT,"who travels through woods and through forests, ofttimes fainting with woe"
9764,ARGUMENT,"and with hunger: at last he falls at the feet of his faithful steed, and"
9765,ARGUMENT,"the steed with his foot digs a grave for him. A poor old song, yet very"
9766,ARGUMENT,"dear to the Polish troops! The soldiers recognized it, and the privates"
9767,ARGUMENT,"crowded about the master; they hearkened, and they remembered that"
9768,ARGUMENT,dreadful season when over the grave of their country they had sung this
9769,ARGUMENT,song and departed for the ends of the earth; they called to mind their
9770,ARGUMENT,"long years of wandering, over lands and seas, over frosts and burning"
9771,ARGUMENT,"sands, amid foreign peoples, where often in camp they had been cheered and"
9772,ARGUMENT,"heartened by this folk song. So thinking, they sadly bowed their heads!"
9773,ARGUMENT,
9774,ARGUMENT,"But they raised them straightway, for the master was playing stronger and"
9775,ARGUMENT,"higher notes; he changed his measure, and proclaimed something quite"
9776,ARGUMENT,different from what had preceded. Once more he looked down and measured
9777,ARGUMENT,the strings with his eye; he joined his hands and smote with the two
9778,ARGUMENT,"hammers in unison: the blow was so artistic, so powerful, that the strings"
9779,ARGUMENT,"rang like brazen trumpets, and from the trumpets a well-known song floated"
9780,ARGUMENT,"to the heavens, a triumphal march, ""Poland has not yet perished; march,"
9781,ARGUMENT,"Dombrowski, to Poland!""--And all clapped their hands, and all shouted in"
9782,ARGUMENT,"chorus, ""March, Dombrowski!"""
9783,ARGUMENT,
9784,ARGUMENT,The musician seemed amazed at his own song; he dropped the hammers from
9785,ARGUMENT,his hands and raised his arms aloft; his fox-skin cap dropped from his
9786,ARGUMENT,head to his shoulders; his uplifted beard waved majestically; his cheeks
9787,ARGUMENT,"glowed with a strange flush; in his glance, full of spirit, shone the lire"
9788,ARGUMENT,"of youth. At last, when the old man turned his eyes on Dombrowski, he"
9789,ARGUMENT,"covered them with his hands, and from under his hands gushed a stream of"
9790,ARGUMENT,tears.
9791,ARGUMENT,
9792,ARGUMENT,"""General,"" said he, ""long has our Lithuania awaited thee--long, even as we"
9793,ARGUMENT,Jews have awaited the Messiah; of thee in olden times minstrels prophesied
9794,ARGUMENT,among the folk; thy coming was heralded by a marvel in the sky. Live and
9795,ARGUMENT,"wage war, O thou our--"""
9796,ARGUMENT,
9797,ARGUMENT,"As he spoke, he sobbed; the honest Jew loved his country like a Pole!"
9798,ARGUMENT,"Dombrowski extended his hand to him and thanked him; Jankiel, doffing his"
9799,ARGUMENT,"cap, kissed the leader's hand."
9800,ARGUMENT,
9801,ARGUMENT,"It was time to begin the polanaise.--The Chamberlain stepped forward, and,"
9802,ARGUMENT,lightly throwing back the flowing sleeves of his kontusz and twirling his
9803,ARGUMENT,"mustache, he offered his arm to Zosia; with a polite bow he invited her to"
9804,ARGUMENT,lead off in the first couple. Behind the Chamberlain a long line of
9805,ARGUMENT,couples formed; the signal was given and the dance began--he was its
9806,ARGUMENT,leader.
9807,ARGUMENT,
9808,ARGUMENT,"Over the greensward glittered his crimson boots, the light gleamed from"
9809,ARGUMENT,"his sabre and his rich girdle shone; he advanced slowly, with seeming"
9810,ARGUMENT,carelessness--yet in every step and every motion one could read the
9811,ARGUMENT,"feelings and the thoughts of the dancer. He stopped, as if he wished to"
9812,ARGUMENT,question his lady; he bent his head down towards her as if wishing to
9813,ARGUMENT,"whisper in her ear; the lady averted her head, was bashful, would not"
9814,ARGUMENT,listen; he doffed his white cap and bowed humbly; the lady deigned to gaze
9815,ARGUMENT,"upon him, but still kept a stubborn silence; he slackened his pace,"
9816,ARGUMENT,"followed her glances with his eyes, and at last he laughed.--Happy in her"
9817,ARGUMENT,"reply, he advanced more quickly, gazing down at his rivals; now he hung"
9818,ARGUMENT,"his white cap with its heron's plumes over his brow, now he shook it above"
9819,ARGUMENT,his brow; at last he cocked it over his ear and twirled his mustache. He
9820,ARGUMENT,strode on; all felt envious of him and pressed upon him in pursuit; he
9821,ARGUMENT,would have been glad to steal away from the throng with his lady; at times
9822,ARGUMENT,"he stood still, courteously raised his hand, and humbly begged them to"
9823,ARGUMENT,pass by; sometimes he meditated withdrawing adroitly to one side; he often
9824,ARGUMENT,"changed his course, and would have been glad to elude his comrades, but"
9825,ARGUMENT,"they importunately followed him with swift steps, and encircled him from"
9826,ARGUMENT,"all sides in the evolutions of the dance: so he grew angry, and laid his"
9827,ARGUMENT,"right hand on his sword hilt, as if to say: ""I care not for you; woe to"
9828,ARGUMENT,"those who are jealous of me!"" He turned about with a haughty brow and with"
9829,ARGUMENT,"a challenge in his eye, and made straight for the throng; the throng of"
9830,ARGUMENT,"dancers did not dare withstand him, but retired from his path--and,"
9831,ARGUMENT,"changing their formation, they started again in pursuit of him.--"
9832,ARGUMENT,
9833,ARGUMENT,"Cries rang out on all sides: ""Ah, perhaps he is the last--watch, watch, you"
9834,ARGUMENT,young men--perhaps he is the last who can lead the polonaise in such
9835,ARGUMENT,"fashion!"" And the couples followed one another merrily and uproariously;"
9836,ARGUMENT,the circle would disperse and then contract once more! As when an immense
9837,ARGUMENT,"serpent twines into a thousand folds, so there was seen a perpetual change"
9838,ARGUMENT,"amid the gay, parti-coloured garments of the ladies, the gentlemen, and"
9839,ARGUMENT,"the soldiers, like glittering scales gilded by the beams of the western"
9840,ARGUMENT,sun and relieved against the dark pillows of turf. Brisk was the dance and
9841,ARGUMENT,"loud the music, the applause, and the drinking of healths."
9842,ARGUMENT,
9843,ARGUMENT,"Corporal Buzzard Dobrzynski alone neither listened to the band, nor"
9844,ARGUMENT,"danced, nor made him merry; with his hands behind him he stood glum and"
9845,ARGUMENT,sullen and called to mind his old-time wooing of Zosia; how he had loved
9846,ARGUMENT,"to bring her flowers, to plait little baskets, to gather birds' nests, to"
9847,ARGUMENT,make little earrings. Ungrateful girl! Though he had wasted upon her so
9848,ARGUMENT,"many lovely gifts, though she had fled from him, though his father had"
9849,ARGUMENT,"forbidden him, yet how many times he had sat on the wall just to see her"
9850,ARGUMENT,"through the window, and had stolen into the hemp in order to watch how she"
9851,ARGUMENT,"tended her little flower garden, picked cucumbers, or fed the roosters!"
9852,ARGUMENT,Ungrateful girl! He drooped his head; finally he whistled a mazurka; then
9853,ARGUMENT,"he jammed his casque down over his ears and went to the camp, where the"
9854,ARGUMENT,"sentinels were standing by the cannon: there, to distract his mind, he"
9855,ARGUMENT,"began a game of cribbage with the private soldiers, and sweetened his"
9856,ARGUMENT,sorrow with the cup. Such was the constancy of Dobrzynski to Zosia.
9857,ARGUMENT,
9858,ARGUMENT,"Zosia was dancing merrily: but, though she was in the first couple, from a"
9859,ARGUMENT,distance she could hardly be seen; on the broad surface of the turf-spread
9860,ARGUMENT,"court, in her green gown and decked with garlands and with flowery"
9861,ARGUMENT,"wreaths, she circled amid the grasses and flowers unseen in her flight,"
9862,ARGUMENT,guiding the dance as an angel guides the motion of the stars by night: you
9863,ARGUMENT,"could guess where she was, for towards her all eyes were turned and all"
9864,ARGUMENT,arms stretched out; towards her the tumult pressed. In vain did the
9865,ARGUMENT,Chamberlain strive to remain by her side; his envious rivals had already
9866,ARGUMENT,pressed him out of the first couple: nor did the happy Dombrowski long
9867,ARGUMENT,"enjoy his triumph; he yielded her to a second, but a third was already"
9868,ARGUMENT,"hastening up; and he, too, at once pressed aside, departed without hope."
9869,ARGUMENT,"At last Zosia, by this time wearied, met Thaddeus as she passed down the"
9870,ARGUMENT,"line; and, fearing further change, and wishing to remain with him, she"
9871,ARGUMENT,brought the dance to an end. She went to the table to pour wine for the
9872,ARGUMENT,guests.
9873,ARGUMENT,
9874,ARGUMENT,"The sun was already setting, the evening was warm and quiet; the circle of"
9875,ARGUMENT,"the heavens, here and there strewn with little clouds, was azure on high,"
9876,ARGUMENT,"but rosy in the west; the little clouds foretold fine weather, being light"
9877,ARGUMENT,"and shining--here like flocks of sheep sleeping on the greensward, there of"
9878,ARGUMENT,"somewhat smaller size, like coveys of teal. In the west was a cloud in"
9879,ARGUMENT,"shape like the drapery curtains of a couch, transparent and with many"
9880,ARGUMENT,"folds, pearly at the summit, gilded on the margin, purple in the centre;"
9881,ARGUMENT,it still burned and glowed with the western gleams; at last it slowly
9882,ARGUMENT,"turned yellow, then pale and grey; the sun dropped its head, drew the"

9927,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"[The following summary of a few important events in Polish history, and of"
9928,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"some of the leading features of Polish society and institutions, may be of"
9929,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,assistance to readers of _Pan Tadeusz_.
9930,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,
9931,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"The Polish Commonwealth was formed by the union of two separate states,"
9932,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Poland proper on the west, with a population predominantly Polish, and"
9933,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Lithuania on the east, with a population Lithuanian in the north"
9934,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,(Lithuania proper) and Russian in the rest of its territory. After being
9935,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"long at odds with each other and with the German Knights of the Cross,"
9936,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,these two states were united in 1386 by the marriage of Queen Jadwiga of
9937,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Poland to the heathen Prince Jagiello of Lithuania, who thereupon accepted"
9938,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,Christianity (p. 288). They remained under the dominion of the Jagiellos
9939,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"until the last of the male line of that house, Zygmunt August (compare"
9940,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"note 64), died childless in 1572, and the throne became elective. The"
9941,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"union was at first very loose, depending only on the person of the"
9942,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"sovereign, but it became constantly closer, until in 1569 the two states"
9943,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"agreed to have a common Diet, sitting at Warsaw. Lithuania retained until"
9944,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"the last, however, its separate officials, treasury, and army (compare pp."
9945,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"171 and 310, and note 29). A constant stream of colonisation flowed east"
9946,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"from Poland (called the Crown or the Kingdom) into Lithuania (p. 168),"
9947,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"until the gentry of that country became Polish, while the peasantry"
9948,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,remained either Lithuanian or Russian.
9949,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,
9950,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,In the Polish Commonwealth the towns were of small importance; their
9951,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"inhabitants, though personally free, had almost no political rights. The"
9952,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"country population was divided into the _szlachta_, or freemen, who fought"
9953,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,the battles of the country and in whom was vested the entire political
9954,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"power, and the _chlopi_, or peasants, who were serfs, and cultivated the"
9955,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"estates of the _szlachta_. The _szlachta_, who formed about a tenth of the"
9956,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"population of the country, were legally all of equal rank (p. 100); as a"
9957,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"matter of fact, differences of property created great social and even (in"
9958,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"practice) political distinctions between them. Some of them, possessed of"
9959,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"mere patches of land, lived a life little different from that of the"
9960,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,peasants (p. 167). Still others entirely lost their land and became
9961,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"attached, even as menial servants, to the households of their richer"
9962,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"neighbours. (Thus Gerwazy was a servant, though not quite a menial, of the"
9963,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Pantler.) The great land owners (or _magnates_), by gathering around them"
9964,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"hordes of gentle-born, landless dependents, were able to support private"
9965,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"armies, and to exercise a preponderating influence on the affairs of the"
9966,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"country. Hence the Constitution of May 3, 1791, excluded _szlachta_ not"
9967,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,holding land from the right to vote.--In English works on Poland the words
9968,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,_szlachta_ and _szlachcic_ have usually been rendered as _nobility_ and
9969,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,_noble_; in the present volume the terms _gentry_ and _gentleman_ are
9970,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"used, which, though far from satisfactory, are at all events somewhat less"
9971,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,misleading.
9972,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,
9973,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,The adoption of the elective instead of the hereditary principle in Poland
9974,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"after the extinction of the Jagiello line led to frequent civil wars, and"
9975,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,was one cause of the country's decline in power during the seventeenth and
9976,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,eighteenth centuries. The King was elected for life by the whole body of
9977,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"the gentry, and every gentleman was theoretically eligible to the crown"
9978,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,(p. 264). Poland's peculiar parliamentary system also contributed to its
9979,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"decay. Laws were made by a Diet of which the upper house, or Senate, was"
9980,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"formed by the bishops, wojewodas (see note 26), castellans (see note 38),"
9981,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"and ministers, while the lower house was composed of deputies elected by"
9982,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,district diets (p. 303). A unanimous vote was required on all measures;
9983,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"more than this, any one deputy by his _veto_ could dissolve the Diet, even"
9984,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"in the last moments of its session, and undo all the work previously"
9985,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"accomplished. This law of the _liberum veto_, and the elective nature of"
9986,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"the royal office, offered countless opportunities for foreign nations to"
9987,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"interfere in the affairs of the Commonwealth. The district diets, besides"
9988,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"electing deputies to the General Diet, instructed them how to vote, and"
9989,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,chose local officials (p. 75); they also were bound by the rule of the
9990,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"_liberum veto_ (pp. 182, 304). Under such a constitution the only"
9991,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"practical means of reform was through armed rebellion. Hence rebellions,"
9992,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"or _confederacies_, were legalised in Poland; a number of citizens might"
9993,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"combine together, choose a marshal (pp. 180, 182, 285), and seek to"
9994,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,overthrow the established order; in case of success they became the
9995,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"government, in case of failure they were not liable to punishment. A diet"
9996,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"held by a confederacy was not subject to the _liberum veto_, but adopted"
9997,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,decisions by a majority vote.
9998,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,
9999,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"In the seventeenth century, not to speak of civil troubles, Poland was"
10000,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"devastated by disastrous wars, in particular with the Cossacks and with"
10001,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"the Swedes (1655-60; pp. 169, 302). The great victory of Jan Sobieski, the"
10002,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"warrior king, over the Turks in 1683, when he went to the relief of"
10003,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Vienna, was the last military triumph of old Poland (pp. 167, 170, 200,"
10004,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,201).
10005,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,
10006,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,During the eighteenth century Poland sank to a condition of disgraceful
10007,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"dependence on Russia. In 1764 Catharine II. caused her favourite,"
10008,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Stanislaw Poniatowski, to be elected King. In 1768 Polish patriots, in a"
10009,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"convulsive effort to throw off the Russian ascendancy, organised the"
10010,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Confederacy of Bar, which maintained a desperate struggle for four years."
10011,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"The Confederacy was crushed by Russia, and soon after its defeat followed"
10012,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"the first partition of Poland (1772), by which Russia received a large"
10013,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"share of the former Lithuanian provinces. A Diet, convoked under the forms"
10014,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"of a confederacy, in order to avoid dissolution by the _liberum veto,_ was"
10015,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"obliged to sanction this partition. The desperate opposition of Rejtan,"
10016,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"the deputy from the district of Nowogrodek (that is, from the region of"
10017,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"which Mickiewicz was a native), Korsak, and other patriots, was of no"
10018,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"avail (pp. 3, 139, 140)."
10019,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,
10020,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,After the disaster of the first partition the patriotic party in Poland
10021,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"made efforts to save their country, which culminated in the Four Years'"
10022,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Diet (1788-92). The labours of this Diet, which again was convoked under"
10023,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"the forms of a confederacy, culminated in the Constitution of May 3, 1791."
10024,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"This measure, which was drawn up in secret and rushed through the Diet at"
10025,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"a time when most of its probable opponents were absent, transformed Poland"
10026,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"from an aristocratic republic into a constitutional hereditary monarchy,"
10027,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"abolished the _liberum veto_, and secured religious toleration. Amid great"
10028,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,enthusiasm the King took the oath to the new order of government (p. 324).
10029,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,
10030,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"In the next year, however, a group of upholders of the old anarchic state"
10031,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"of affairs, one of whose leaders was Ksawery Branicki (p. 200), formed"
10032,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,with the support of Russia a confederacy which was proclaimed at Targowica
10033,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"(pp. 274, 324), a small town in the Ukraine, and the object of which was"
10034,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,the undoing of the work of the Four Years' Diet. The Russian armies
10035,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"entered the country and overcame the resistance of the Polish troops, two"
10036,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"of the foremost leaders of which were Prince Joseph Poniatowski, the"
10037,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"nephew of the King, and Kosciuszko. Then followed the second partition of"
10038,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Poland (1793), by which the territory of the Commonwealth was reduced to"
10039,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,about one third of its original dimensions. In the next year occurred a
10040,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"popular revolt, of which Kosciuszko assumed the leadership, and which,"
10041,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"despite a brilliant victory at Raclawice (p. 252), near Cracow, and some"
10042,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"other successes, was soon quelled by the allied powers, Russia, Prussia,"
10043,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"and Austria. In a battle at Maciejowice (p. 252) Kosciuszko was defeated,"
10044,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"and, severely wounded, was himself taken prisoner by the Russians. The"
10045,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"final episode of the war was the fall of Warsaw. Suvorov, the Russian"
10046,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"commander, captured by storm Praga, a suburb of the city, and gave over"
10047,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"its inhabitants to massacre (pp. 3, 324). In the following year, 1795, the"
10048,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,remnant of the Polish kingdom was divided among the three allies.
10049,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,
10050,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,Even now not all the Poles despaired of their country's fate. The idea
10051,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,arose of transferring to France the headquarters of Polish interests and
10052,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,of forming bodies of Polish troops that should fight for France against
10053,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,the common enemies of France and Poland and thereby prepare themselves for
10054,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"service in the restoration of Poland. The leader of this movement, and the"
10055,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"most noted general of the new _Polish Legions_, was Jan Henryk Dombrowski,"
10056,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,who had won fame in the war of 1794. The Legions' first field of activity
10057,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"was in northern Italy, where they supported the struggle of Lombardy for"
10058,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"independence. Here arose (1797) the famous Song of the Legions, ""Poland"
10059,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"has not yet perished, while we still live"" (pp. 3, 97, 325, 326). In the"
10060,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"next year (1798) Dombrowski aided the French in the capture of Rome, and"
10061,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,Kniaziewicz was put in command of the garrison on the Capitol (p. 31). In
10062,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,1800 a new Polish force won laurels at Marengo and Hohenlinden (p. 286).
10063,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,In return for these services Bonaparte did nothing whatever for the
10064,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,restoration of Poland. The legions were sent oversea to reduce the negro
10065,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"insurrection in the island of San Domingo, where the greater part of them"
10066,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,perished (1803; p. 31).
10067,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,
10068,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"In 1806, after his victory at Jena (p. 176), Napoleon summoned the Poles"
10069,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"to his standards. A large force was organised, under the command of Prince"
10070,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Joseph Poniatowski and Dombrowski. In the succeeding war, which includes"
10071,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,the siege and capture of Dantzic (p. 116) and the battle of
10072,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Preussisch-Eylau (p. 251),"
10073,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,
10074,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,Napoleon decisively defeated the Russians at Friedland (1807) and soon
10075,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,after concluded the Peace of Tilsit (p. 161). By this treaty there was
10076,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"created, out of a portion of the Polish lands received by Prussia at the"
10077,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"different partitions, a new state, known as the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, and"
10078,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,ruled by the King of Saxony as a constitutional monarch under the
10079,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,protection of Napoleon. The Niemen divided this new state from the portion
10080,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"of Poland under the rule of Russia (pp. 31, 255)."
10081,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,
10082,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,The new Grand Duchy had to furnish troops in aid of Napoleon. In 1808 the
10083,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Polish light cavalry, led by Kozietulski, won glory by the capture of"
10084,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Somosierra, a defile leading to Madrid (p. 286)."
10085,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,
10086,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"In 1809, after a war with Austria, in which he received valuable aid from"
10087,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"the Poles, Napoleon increased the Grand Duchy of Warsaw by lands taken"
10088,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"from that country. Tardy and ungenerous though his action had been, he had"
10089,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,thus done something to justify the hopes of the Poles that he would one
10090,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,day reconstitute their Commonwealth as a whole. Hence it will be clear
10091,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"with what enthusiasm Poland, and still more Lithuania, awaited the outcome"
10092,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"of a great war between Napoleon and Russia, such as was evidently"
10093,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,approaching in the year 1811. The Poles believed Napoleon to be
10094,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"unconquerable, and trusted that when he had defeated Russia he would"
10095,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,proclaim the reunion of Lithuania with the Grand Duchy of Warsaw; then
10096,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Poland would live once more (pp. 160, 277)."
10097,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,
10098,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,The actual outcome of the war was a crushing blow to Polish hopes.
10099,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,Napoleon's invasion of Russia resulted in his utter defeat; after his
10100,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"flight home his army was defeated at Leipzig (1813), where Prince Joseph"
10101,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Poniatowski met his death. Two years later, at the Congress of Vienna, the"
10102,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"greater portion of Poland was given over to Russia, to be governed as a"
10103,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"constitutional state. Such it remained, in name at least, until the"
10104,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"desperate insurrection of 1831, the failure of which ended all pretence of"
10105,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,Polish self-government under Russian rule. To drown the grief and despair
10106,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,with which that tragedy had filled his mind Mickiewicz turned back in the
10107,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"next year (when he began _Pan Tadeusz_) to the scenes of his childhood, to"
10108,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,the days full of hope and joyful expectation that had preceded Napoleon's
10109,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,attack on Russia.]
10110,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,
10111,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,1 In the time of the Polish Commonwealth the carrying out of judicial
10112,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"decrees was very difficult, in a country where the executive authorities"
10113,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"had almost no police at their disposal, and where powerful citizens"
10114,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"maintained household regiments, some of them, for example the Princes"
10115,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Radziwill, even armies of several thousand. So the plaintiff who had"
10116,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,obtained a verdict in his favour had to apply for its execution to the
10117,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"knightly order, that is to the gentry, with whom rested also the executive"
10118,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"power. Armed kinsmen, friends, and neighbours set out, verdict in hand, in"
10119,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"company with the apparitor, and gained possession, often not without"
10120,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"bloodshed, of the goods adjudged to the plaintiff, which the apparitor"
10121,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,legally made over or gave into his possession. Such an armed execution of
10122,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"a verdict was called a _zajazd_ [foray]. In ancient times, while laws were"
10123,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"respected, even the most powerful magnates did not dare to resist judicial"
10124,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"decrees, armed attacks rarely took place, and violence almost never went"
10125,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,unpunished. Well known in history is the sad end of Prince Wasil
10126,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Sanguszko, and of Stadnicki, called the Devil.--The corruption of public"
10127,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"morals in the Commonwealth increased the number of forays, which"
10128,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,continually disturbed the peace of Lithuania. [The rendering of _zajazd_
10129,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,by _foray_ is of course inexact and conventional; but the translator did
10130,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,not wish to use the Polish word and could find no better English
10131,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,equivalent.]
10132,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,
10133,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,2 Every one in Poland knows of the miraculous image of Our Lady at Jasna
10134,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Gora in Czenstochowa. In Lithuania there are images of Our Lady, famed for"
10135,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"miracles, at the Ostra [Pointed] Gate in Wilno, the Castle in Nowogrodek,"
10136,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,and at Zyrowiec and Boruny.

10141,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,patriot was a native of the same portion of Lithuania as Mickiewicz. He
10142,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,early emigrated to America and served with distinction in the
10143,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,Revolutionary War. On his later career see p. 334. After the failure of
10144,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,the insurrection of 1794 Kosciuszko was imprisoned for two years in St.
10145,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Petersburg; in 1796, on the death of Catharine, he was released by Paul."

10148,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,service. At the Congress of Vienna he made fruitless efforts in behalf of
10149,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,Poland. His memory is probably more reverenced by the Polish people than
10150,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"that of any other man. His remains rest in the cathedral at Cracow, and on"

10171,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,Lithuania was allowed to retain its ancient organisation of civil and
10172,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"criminal courts. So, as of old, rural and town judges are elected in the"
10173,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"districts, and superior judges in the provinces. But since there is an"
10174,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"appeal to St. Petersburg, to many institutions of various rank, the local"
