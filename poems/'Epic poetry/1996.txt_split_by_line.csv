176,CANTO I.,To run over better waters the little vessel of my genius now hoists its
177,CANTO I.,"sails, and leaves behind itself a sea so cruel; and I will sing of that"
178,CANTO I.,second realm where the human spirit is purified and becomes worthy to
179,CANTO I.,ascend to heaven.
180,CANTO I.,
181,CANTO I.,"But here let dead poesy rise again, O holy Muses, since yours I am, and"
182,CANTO I.,"here let Calliope somewhat mount up, accompanying my song with that"
183,CANTO I.,sound of which the wretched Picae felt the stroke such that they
184,CANTO I.,despaired of pardon.[1]
185,CANTO I.,
186,CANTO I.,"[1] The nine daughters of Pieros, king of Emathia, who, contending in"
187,CANTO I.,"song with the Muses, were for their presumption changed to magpies."
188,CANTO I.,
189,CANTO I.,
190,CANTO I.,"A sweet color of oriental sapphire, which was gathering in the serene"
191,CANTO I.,"aspect of the sky, pure even to the first circle,[1] renewed delight to"
192,CANTO I.,my eyes soon as I issued forth from the dead air that had afflicted my
193,CANTO I.,eyes and my breast. The fair planet which incites to love was making
194,CANTO I.,"all the Orient to smile, veiling the Fishes that were in her train.[2]"
195,CANTO I.,"I turned me to the right hand, and fixed my mind upon the other pole,"
196,CANTO I.,and saw four stars never seen save by the first people.[3] The heavens
197,CANTO I.,"appeared to rejoice in their flamelets. O widowed northern region,"
198,CANTO I.,since thou art deprived of beholding these!
199,CANTO I.,
200,CANTO I.,"[1] By “the first circle,” Dante seems to mean the horizon."
201,CANTO I.,
202,CANTO I.,
203,CANTO I.,"[2] At the spring equinox Venus is in the sign of the Pisces, which"
204,CANTO I.,"immediately precedes that of Aries, in which is the Sun. The time"
205,CANTO I.,indicated is therefore an hour or more before sunrise on Easter
206,CANTO I.,"morning, April 10."
207,CANTO I.,
208,CANTO I.,
209,CANTO I.,"When I had withdrawn from regarding them, turning me a little to the"
210,CANTO I.,"other pole, there whence the Wain had already disappeared, I saw close"
211,CANTO I.,"to me an old man alone, worthy in look of so much reverence that no son"
212,CANTO I.,owes more unto his father.[1] He wore a long beard and mingled with
213,CANTO I.,"white hair, like his locks, of which a double list fell upon his"
214,CANTO I.,"breast. The rays of the four holy stars so adorned his face with light,"
215,CANTO I.,"that I saw him, as if the sun had been in front."
216,CANTO I.,
217,CANTO I.,"[1] These stars are the symbols of the four Cardinal Virtues,—Prudence,"
218,CANTO I.,"Temperance, Fortitude, and Justice,—the virtues of active life,"
219,CANTO I.,"sufficient to guide men in the right path, but not to bring them to"
220,CANTO I.,"Paradise. By the first people arc probably meant Adam and Eve, who from"
221,CANTO I.,"the terrestrial Paradise, on the summit of the Mount of Purgatory, had"
222,CANTO I.,"seen these stars, visible only from the Southern hemisphere. According"
223,CANTO I.,"to the geography of the time Asia and Africa lay north of the equator,"
224,CANTO I.,so that even to their inhabitants these stars were invisible. Possibly
225,CANTO I.,"the meaning is that these stars, symbolizing the cardinal virtues, had"
226,CANTO I.,been visible only in the golden age.
227,CANTO I.,
228,CANTO I.,
229,CANTO I.,"This old man, as soon appears, is the younger Cato, and the office here"
230,CANTO I.,given to him of warden of the souls in the outer region of Purgatory
231,CANTO I.,"was suggested by the position assigned to him by Virgil in the Aeneid,"
232,CANTO I.,"viii. 670. “Secretosque pios, his dantem jura Catonem.”"
233,CANTO I.,
234,CANTO I.,"It has been objected to Virgil’s thus putting him in Elysium, that as a"
235,CANTO I.,suicide his place was in the Mourning Fields. A similar objection may
236,CANTO I.,be made to Dante’s separating him from the other suicides in the
237,CANTO I.,"seventh circle of Hell (Canto XIII.). “But,” says Conington, “Virgil"
238,CANTO I.,did not aim at perfect consistency. It was enough for him that Cato was
239,CANTO I.,one who from his character in life might be justly conceived of as
240,CANTO I.,"lawgiver to the dead.” So Dante, using Cato as an allegoric figure,"
241,CANTO I.,"regards him as one who, before the coming of Christ, practised the"
242,CANTO I.,"virtues which are required to liberate the soul from sin, and who, as"
243,CANTO I.,"be says in the De Monarchia (ii. 5), “that he might kindle the love of"
244,CANTO I.,"liberty in the world, showed how precious it was, by preferring death"
245,CANTO I.,with liberty to life without it.” This liberty is the type of that
246,CANTO I.,"spiritual freedom which Dante is seeking, and which, being the perfect"
247,CANTO I.,"conformity of the human will to the will of God, is the aim and"
248,CANTO I.,fruition of nil redeemed souls.
249,CANTO I.,
250,CANTO I.,"In the region of Purgatory outside the gate, the souls have not yet"
251,CANTO I.,"attained this freedom; they are on the way to it, and Cato is"
252,CANTO I.,allegorically fit to warn and spur them on.
253,CANTO I.,
254,CANTO I.,“Who are ye that counter to the blind stream have fled from the eternal
255,CANTO I.,"prison?” said he, moving those venerable plumes. “Who has guided you?"
256,CANTO I.,"Or who was a lamp to you, issuing forth from the deep night that ever"
257,CANTO I.,makes the infernal valley black? Are the laws of the abyss thus broken?
258,CANTO I.,"or is a new design changed in heaven that, being damned, ye come unto"
259,CANTO I.,my rocks?”
260,CANTO I.,
261,CANTO I.,"My Leader then took hold of me, and with words, and with hands, and"
262,CANTO I.,"with signs, made my legs and my brow reverent. Then he answered him,"
263,CANTO I.,"“Of myself I came not; a Lady descended from Heaven, through whose"
264,CANTO I.,prayers I succored this man with my company. But since it is thy will
265,CANTO I.,"that more of our condition be unfolded to thee as it truly is, mine"
266,CANTO I.,cannot be that to thee this be denied. This man has not seen his last
267,CANTO I.,"evening, but through his folly was so near thereto that very little"
268,CANTO I.,"time there was to turn. Even as I have said, I was sent to him to"
269,CANTO I.,"rescue him, and there was no other way than this, along which I have"
270,CANTO I.,set myself. I have shown to him all the guilty people; and now I intend
271,CANTO I.,to show him those spirits that purge themselves under thy ward. How I
272,CANTO I.,"have led him, it would be long to tell thee; from on high descends"
273,CANTO I.,power that aids me to conduct him to see thee and to hear thee. Now may
274,CANTO I.,"it please thee to approve his coming. He goes seeking liberty, which is"
275,CANTO I.,"so dear, as he knows who for her refuses life. Thou knowest it, for"
276,CANTO I.,"death for her sake was not hitter to thee in Utica, where thou didst"
277,CANTO I.,leave the garment that on the great day shall he so bright. The eternal
278,CANTO I.,"edicts are not violated by us, for this one is alive, and Minos does"
279,CANTO I.,not bind me; but I am of the circle where are the chaste eyes of thy
280,CANTO I.,"Marcia, who in her look still prays thee, O holy breast, that for thine"
281,CANTO I.,"own thou hold her. For her love, then, incline thyself to us; let us go"
282,CANTO I.,on through thy seven realms.[1] Thanks unto thee will I carry back to
283,CANTO I.,"her, if to be mentioned there below thou deign.”"
284,CANTO I.,
285,CANTO I.,[1] The seven circles of Purgatory.
286,CANTO I.,
287,CANTO I.,
288,CANTO I.,"“Marcia so pleased my eyes while I was on earth,” said he then, “that"
289,CANTO I.,"whatsoever grace she wished from me I did it; now, that on the other"
290,CANTO I.,"side of the evil stream she dwells, she can no more move me, by that"
291,CANTO I.,law which was made when thence I issued forth.[1] But if a Lady of
292,CANTO I.,"heaven move and direct thee, as thou sayest, there is no need of"
293,CANTO I.,flattery; suffice it fully to thee that for her sake thou askest me. Go
294,CANTO I.,"then, and see thou gird this one with a smooth rush, and that thou wash"
295,CANTO I.,"his face so that thou remove all sully from it, for it were not"
296,CANTO I.,befitting to go with eye overcast by any cloud before the first
297,CANTO I.,"minister that is of those of Paradise. This little island, round about"
298,CANTO I.,"at its base, down there yonder where the wave heats it, bears rushes"
299,CANTO I.,"upon its soft ooze. No plant of other kind, that might put forth leaf"
300,CANTO I.,"or grow hard, can there have life, because it yields not to the shocks."
301,CANTO I.,Thereafter let not your return be this way; the Sun which now is rising
302,CANTO I.,will show you to take the mountain by easier ascent.”
303,CANTO I.,
304,CANTO I.,[1] The law that the redeemed cannot be touched by other than heavenly
305,CANTO I.,affections.
306,CANTO I.,
307,CANTO I.,
308,CANTO I.,"So he disappeared, and I rose up, without speaking, and drew me close"
309,CANTO I.,"to my Leader, and turned my eyes to him. He began, “Son, follow my"
310,CANTO I.,"steps; let us turn back, for this plain slopes that way to its low"
311,CANTO I.,limits.”
312,CANTO I.,
313,CANTO I.,"The dawn was vanquishing the matin hour which fled before it, so that"
314,CANTO I.,from afar I discerned the trembling of the sea. We set forth over the
315,CANTO I.,"solitary plain like a man who turns unto the road which he has lost,"
316,CANTO I.,"and, till he come to it, seems to himself to go in vain. When we were"
317,CANTO I.,"where the dew contends with the sun, and, through being in a place"
318,CANTO I.,"where there is shade, is little dissipated, my Master softly placed"
319,CANTO I.,"both his hands outspread upon the grass. Whereon I, who perceived his"
320,CANTO I.,"design, stretched toward him my tear-stained cheeks. Here he wholly"
321,CANTO I.,uncovered that color of mine which hell had hidden on me.[1]
322,CANTO I.,
323,CANTO I.,"[1] Allegorically, when the soul has entered upon the way of"
324,CANTO I.,"purification Reason, with the dew of repentance, washes off the stain"
325,CANTO I.,"of sin, and girds the spirit with humility."
326,CANTO I.,
327,CANTO I.,
328,CANTO I.,"We came, then, to the desert shore that never saw navigate its waters"
329,CANTO I.,"one who afterwards had experience of return. Here he girt me, even as"
330,CANTO I.,"pleased the other. O marvel! that such as he plucked the humble plant,"
331,CANTO I.,it instantly sprang up again there whence he tore it.[1]

345,CANTO II.,
346,CANTO II.,Now had the sun reached the horizon whose meridian circle covers
347,CANTO II.,Jerusalem with its highest point; and the night which circles opposite
348,CANTO II.,to it was issuing forth from Ganges with the Scales that fall from her
349,CANTO II.,hand when she exceeds;[1] so that where I was the white and red cheeks
350,CANTO II.,of the beautiful Aurora by too much age were becoming orange.
351,CANTO II.,
352,CANTO II.,"[1] Purgatory and Jerusalem are antipodal, and in one direction the"
353,CANTO II.,Ganges or India was arbitrarily assumed to be their common horizon. The
354,CANTO II.,"night is here taken as the point of the Heavens opposite the sun, and"
355,CANTO II.,"the sun being in Aries, the night is in Libra. When night exceeds, that"
356,CANTO II.,"is, at the autumnal equinox, when the night becomes longer than the"
357,CANTO II.,"day, the Scales may be said to drop from her hand, since the sun enters"
358,CANTO II.,Libra.
359,CANTO II.,
360,CANTO II.,
361,CANTO II.,"We were still alongside the sea, like folk who are thinking of their"
362,CANTO II.,"road, who go in heart and linger in body; and lo! as, at approach of"
363,CANTO II.,"the morning, through the dense vapors Mars glows ruddy, down in the"
364,CANTO II.,"west above the ocean floor, such appeared to me,—so may I again behold"
365,CANTO II.,it!—a light along the sea coming so swiftly that no flight equals its
366,CANTO II.,motion. From which when I had a little withdrawn my eye to ask my
367,CANTO II.,"Leader, again I saw it, brighter become and larger. Then on each side"
368,CANTO II.,"of it appeared to me a something, I know not what, white, and beneath,"
369,CANTO II.,"little by little, another came forth from it. My Master still said not"
370,CANTO II.,"a word, until the first white things showed themselves wings; then,"
371,CANTO II.,"When he clearly recognized the pilot, he cried out, “Mind, mind, thou"
372,CANTO II.,bend thy knees. Lo! the Angel of God: fold thy hands; henceforth shalt
373,CANTO II.,"thou see such officials. See how he scorns human means, so that he"
374,CANTO II.,"wills not oar, or other sail than his own wings between such distant"
375,CANTO II.,"shores. See, how he holds them straight toward heaven, stroking the air"
376,CANTO II.,with his eternal feathers that are not changed like mortal hair.”
377,CANTO II.,
378,CANTO II.,"Then, as nearer and nearer toward us came the Bird Divine, the brighter"
379,CANTO II.,"he appeared; so that near by my eye endured him not, but I bent it"
380,CANTO II.,"down: and he came on to the shore with a small vessel, very swift and"
381,CANTO II.,light so that the water swallowed naught of it. At the stern stood the
382,CANTO II.,"Celestial Pilot, such that if but described he would make blessed; and"
383,CANTO II.,more than a hundred spirits sat within. “In exitu Israel de Egypto”[1]
384,CANTO II.,"they all were singing together with one voice, with whatso of that"
385,CANTO II.,psalm is after written. Then he made the sign of holy cross upon them;
386,CANTO II.,whereon they all threw themselves upon the strand; and he went away
387,CANTO II.,swift as he had come.

392,CANTO II.,round about like him who of new things makes essay. On all sides the
393,CANTO II.,"Sun, who had with his bright arrows chased from midheaven the"
394,CANTO II.,"Capricorn,[1] was shooting forth the day, when the new people raised"
395,CANTO II.,"their brow toward us, saying to us, “If ye know, show us the way to go"
396,CANTO II.,"unto the mountain.” And Virgil answered, “Ye believe, perchance, that"
397,CANTO II.,"we are acquainted with this place, but we are pilgrims even as ye are."
398,CANTO II.,"Just now we came, a little before you, by another way, which was so"

404,CANTO II.,
405,CANTO II.,"The souls who had become aware concerning me by my breathing, that I"
406,CANTO II.,"was still alive, marvelling became deadly pale. And as to a messenger"
407,CANTO II.,"who bears an olive branch the folk press to hear news, and no one shows"
408,CANTO II.,"himself shy of crowding, so, at the sight of me, those fortunate souls"
409,CANTO II.,"stopped still, all of them, as if forgetting to go to make themselves"
410,CANTO II.,fair.
411,CANTO II.,
412,CANTO II.,I saw one of them drawing forward to embrace me with so great affection
413,CANTO II.,that it moved me to do the like. O shades empty save in aspect! Three
414,CANTO II.,times behind it I clasped my hands and as oft returned with them unto
415,CANTO II.,"my breast. With marvel, I believe, I painted me; wherefore the shade"
416,CANTO II.,"smiled and drew back, and I, following it, pressed forward, Gently it"
417,CANTO II.,"said, that I should pause; then I knew who it was, and I prayed it that"
418,CANTO II.,"to speak with me it would stop a little. It replied to me, “So as I"
419,CANTO II.,"loved thee in the mortal body, so loosed from it I love thee; therefore"
420,CANTO II.,I stop; but wherefore goest thou?”
421,CANTO II.,
422,CANTO II.,"“Casella mine, in order to return another time to this place where I"
423,CANTO II.,"am, do I make this journey,” said I, “but from thee how has so much"
424,CANTO II.,time been taken?”[1]
425,CANTO II.,
426,CANTO II.,[1] “How has thy coming hither been delayed so long since thy death?”
427,CANTO II.,
428,CANTO II.,
429,CANTO II.,"And he to me, “No wrong has been done me if he[1] who takes both when"
430,CANTO II.,and whom it pleases him ofttimes hath denied to me this passage; for of
431,CANTO II.,a just will[2] his own is made. Truly for three months he has taken
432,CANTO II.,with all peace whoso has wished to enter. Wherefore I who was now
433,CANTO II.,turned to the seashore where the water of Tiber grows salt was
434,CANTO II.,benignantly received by him.[3] To that outlet has he now turned his
435,CANTO II.,"wing, because always those assemble there who towards Acheron do not"

507,CANTO III.,"heaven rises highest from the sea. The sun, which behind was flaming"
508,CANTO III.,"ruddy, was broken in front of me by the figure that the staying of its"
509,CANTO III.,rays upon me formed. When I saw the ground darkened only in front of
510,CANTO III.,"me, I turned me to my side with fear of being abandoned: and my"
511,CANTO III.,"Comfort, wholly turning to me, began to say, “Why dost thou still"
512,CANTO III.,"distrust? Dost thou not believe me with thee, and that I guide thee? It"
513,CANTO III.,is now evening there where the body is buried within which I cast a
514,CANTO III.,"shadow; Naples holds it, and from Brundusium it is taken; if now in"

535,CANTO III.,"We had come, meanwhile, to the foot of the mountain; here we found the"

537,CANTO III.,"Lerici and Turbia[1] the most deserted, the most secluded way is a"
538,CANTO III.,"stair easy and open, compared with that. “Now who knows on which hand"

549,CANTO III.,"to me a company of souls who were moving their feet towards us, and"
550,CANTO III.,"seemed not, so slowly were they coming. “Lift,” said I to the Master,"
551,CANTO III.,"“thine eyes, lo! on this side who will give us counsel, if thou from"
552,CANTO III.,"thyself canst not have it.” He looked at them, and with air of relief,"
553,CANTO III.,"answered, “Let us go thither, for they come slowly, and do thou confirm"
554,CANTO III.,"thy hope, sweet son."
555,CANTO III.,
556,CANTO III.,"That people was still as far, I mean after a thousand steps of ours, as"
557,CANTO III.,"a good thrower would cast with his hand, when they all pressed up to"
558,CANTO III.,"the hard masses of the high bank, and stood still and close, as one who"
559,CANTO III.,"goes in doubt stops to look.[1] “O ye who have made good ends, O"
560,CANTO III.,"spirits already elect,” Virgil began, “by that peace which I believe is"
561,CANTO III.,"awaited by you all, tell us, where the mountain lies so that the going"
562,CANTO III.,up is possible; for to lose time is most displeasing to him who knows
563,CANTO III.,most.”
564,CANTO III.,
565,CANTO III.,"[1] They stopped, surprised, at seeing Virgil and Dante advancing to"
566,CANTO III.,"the left, against the rule in Purgatory, where the course is always to"
567,CANTO III.,"the right, symbolizing progress in good. In Hell the contrary rule"

574,CANTO III.,"she stop, silly and quiet, and wherefore know not; so I saw then moving"
575,CANTO III.,"to approach, the head of that fortunate flock, modest in face and"
576,CANTO III.,dignified in gait.
577,CANTO III.,
578,CANTO III.,When those in front saw the light broken on the ground at my right
579,CANTO III.,"side, so that the shadow fell from me on the cliff, they stopped, and"
580,CANTO III.,"drew somewhat back; and all the rest who were coming behind, not"
581,CANTO III.,"knowing why, did just the same. “Without your asking, I confess to you"
582,CANTO III.,"that this is a human body which you see, whereby the light of the sun"
583,CANTO III.,"on the ground is cleft. Marvel not thereat, but believe that not"
584,CANTO III.,without power that comes from heaven he seeks to surmount this wall.”
585,CANTO III.,"Thus the Master:and that worthy people said, “Turn, enter in advance,"
586,CANTO III.,then;” with the backs of their hands making sign. And one of them
587,CANTO III.,"began, “Whoever thou art, turn thy face as thou thus goest; consider if"
588,CANTO III.,"in the world thou didst ever see me?” I turned me toward him, and"
589,CANTO III.,"looked at him fixedly: blond he was, and beautiful, and of gentle"
590,CANTO III.,"aspect, but a blow had divided one of his eyebrows."
591,CANTO III.,
592,CANTO III.,"When I had humbly disclaimed having ever seen him, he said, “Now look!”"
593,CANTO III.,"and he showed me a wound at the top of his breast. Then he said,"
594,CANTO III.,"smiling, “I am Manfred,[1] grandson of the Empress Constance; wherefore"
595,CANTO III.,"I pray thee, that when thou returnest, thou go to my beautiful"
596,CANTO III.,"daughter,[2] mother of the honor of Sicily and of Aragon, and tell to"
597,CANTO III.,her the truth if aught else be told. After I had my body broken by two
598,CANTO III.,"mortal stabs, I rendered myself, weeping, to Him who pardons willingly."
599,CANTO III.,"Horrible were my sins, but the Infinite Goodness has such wide arms"
600,CANTO III.,"that it takes whatever turns to it. If the Pastor of Cosenza,[3] who"
601,CANTO III.,"was set on the hunt of me by Clement, had then rightly read this page"
602,CANTO III.,"in God, the bones of my body would still be at the head of the bridge"
603,CANTO III.,"near Benevento, under the guard of the heavy cairn. Now the rain bathes"
604,CANTO III.,"them, and the wind moves them forth from the kingdom, almost along the"
605,CANTO III.,"Verde, whither he transferred them with extinguished light.[4] By their"
606,CANTO III.,"[5] malediction the Eternal Love is not so lost that it cannot return,"
607,CANTO III.,"while hope hath speck of green. True is it, that whoso dies in"
608,CANTO III.,"contumacy of Holy Church, though he repent him at the end, needs must"
609,CANTO III.,stay outside[6] upon this bank thirtyfold the whole time that he has
610,CANTO III.,"been in his presumption,[7] if such decree become not shorter through"
611,CANTO III.,"good prayers. See now if thou canst make me glad, revealing to my good"
612,CANTO III.,"Constance how thou hast seen me, and also this prohibition,[8] for here"
613,CANTO III.,through those on earth much is gained.”

616,CANTO III.,in 1258 he was crowned King of Sicily. In 1263 Charles of Anjou was
617,CANTO III.,"called by Pope Urban IV. to contend against him, and in 1266 Manfred"
618,CANTO III.,was killed at the battle of Benevento.

624,CANTO III.,Alphonso James became King of Aragon.  and Frederick King of Sicily.
625,CANTO III.,"Manfred naturally speaks favorably of them, but Dante himself thought"

663,CANTO IV.,believes that one soul above another is kindled in us.[1] And
664,CANTO IV.,"therefore, when a thing is heard or seen, which may hold the soul"
665,CANTO IV.,"intently turned to it, the time passes, and the man observes it not:"
666,CANTO IV.,"for one faculty is that which listens, and another is that which keeps"

689,CANTO IV.,"one fly, I mean with the swift wings and with the feathers of great"
690,CANTO IV.,"desire, behind that guide who gave me hope and made a light for me. We"
691,CANTO IV.,"ascended in through the broken rock, and on each side the border"
692,CANTO IV.,"pressed on us, and the ground beneath required both feet and hands."

700,CANTO IV.,some sage guide appear for us.”
701,CANTO IV.,
702,CANTO IV.,The summit was so high it surpassed the sight and the side steeper far
703,CANTO IV.,"than a line from the mid quadrant to the centre.[1] I was weary, when I"
704,CANTO IV.,"began, “O sweet Father, turn and regard howl remain alone if thou dost"
705,CANTO IV.,"not stop.” “My son,” said he, “far as here drag thyself,” pointing me"
706,CANTO IV.,"to a ledge a little above, which on that side circles all the hill. His"
707,CANTO IV.,"words so spurred me, that I forced myself, scrambling after him, until"
708,CANTO IV.,"the belt was beneath my feet. There we both sat down, turning to the"
709,CANTO IV.,"east, whence we had ascended, for to look back is wont to encourage"
710,CANTO IV.,"one. I first turned my eyes to the low shores, then I raised them to"
711,CANTO IV.,"the sun, and wondered that on the left we were struck by it. The Poet"
712,CANTO IV.,perceived clearly that I was standing all bewildered at the chariot of
713,CANTO IV.,"the light, where between us and Aquilo,[2] it was entering. Whereupon"
714,CANTO IV.,"he to me, “If Castor and Pollux were in company with that mirror [3]"
715,CANTO IV.,"which up and down guides with its light, thou wouldst see the ruddy"
716,CANTO IV.,"Zodiac revolving still closer to the Bears, if it went not out of its"
717,CANTO IV.,"old road.[4] How that may be, if thou wishest to be able to think,"
718,CANTO IV.,collected in thyself imagine Zion and this mountain to stand upon the
719,CANTO IV.,"earth so that both have one sole horizon, and different hemispheres;"
720,CANTO IV.,"then thou wilt see that the road which Phaethon, to his harm, knew not"
721,CANTO IV.,"how to drive, must needs pass on the one side of this mountain, and on"
722,CANTO IV.,"the other side of that, if thy intelligence right clearly heeds.”"
723,CANTO IV.,"“Surely, my Master,” said I, “never yet saw I so clearly, as I now"
724,CANTO IV.,discern there where my wit seemed deficient; for the mid-circle of the
725,CANTO IV.,"supernal motion, which is called Equator in a certain art,[4] and which"
726,CANTO IV.,"always remains between the sun and the winter, for the reason that thou"
727,CANTO IV.,"tellest, from here departs toward the north, while the Hebrews saw it"
728,CANTO IV.,"toward the warm region. But, if it please thee, willingly I would know"
729,CANTO IV.,"how far we have to go, for the hill rises higher than my eyes can"
730,CANTO IV.,"rise.” And he to me, “This mountain is such, that ever at the beginning"
731,CANTO IV.,"below it is hard, and the higher one goes the less it hurts; therefore"
732,CANTO IV.,when it shall seem so pleasant to thee that the going up will be easy
733,CANTO IV.,"to thee as going down the current in a vessel, then wilt thou be at the"
734,CANTO IV.,"end of this path; there repose from toil await: no more I answer, and"

757,CANTO IV.,"turned, and we saw at the left a great stone which neither he nor I"
758,CANTO IV.,before had noticed. Thither we drew; and there were persons who were
759,CANTO IV.,"staying in the shadow behind the rock, as one through indolence sets"
760,CANTO IV.,"himself to stay. And one of them, who seemed to me weary, was seated,"
761,CANTO IV.,"and was clasping his knees, holding his face down low between them. “O"
762,CANTO IV.,"sweet my Lord,” said I, “look at him who shows himself more indolent"
763,CANTO IV.,than if sloth were his sister.” Then that one turned to us and gave
764,CANTO IV.,"heed, moving his look only up along his thigh, and said, “Now go up"
765,CANTO IV.,"thou, for thou art valiant.” I recognized then who he was, and that"
766,CANTO IV.,effort which was still quickening my breath a little hindered not my
767,CANTO IV.,"going to him, and after I had reached him, he scarce raised his head,"
768,CANTO IV.,"saying, “Hast thou clearly seen how the sun over thy left shoulder"
769,CANTO IV.,drives his chariot?”
770,CANTO IV.,
771,CANTO IV.,His slothful acts and his short words moved my lips a little to a
772,CANTO IV.,"smile, then I began, “Belacqua,[1] I do not grieve for thee now,[2] but"
773,CANTO IV.,"tell me why just here thou art seated? awaitest thou a guide, or has"
774,CANTO IV.,"only thy wonted mood recaptured thee?” And he, “Brother, what imports"
775,CANTO IV.,the going up? For the bird of God that sitteth at the gate would not
776,CANTO IV.,let me go to the torments. It first behoves that heaven circle around
777,CANTO IV.,"me outside the gate, as long as it did in life, because I delayed good"

1008,CANTO VI.,"stranger unconcerned in the matter, and, without tears or other sign of"
1009,CANTO VI.,"grief, said, ‘Surely, my lord, it would be to your honor that that poor"

1091,CANTO VI.,"who has become untamed and savage, and oughtest to bestride her"
1092,CANTO VI.,"saddle-bows, may a just judgment from the stars fall upon thy blood,"
1093,CANTO VI.,"and may it be strange and manifest, so that thy successor may have fear"
1094,CANTO VI.,"of it! [2] For thou and thy father, retained up there by greed, have"
1095,CANTO VI.,suffered the garden of the empire to become desert. Come thou to see
1096,CANTO VI.,"Montecchi and Cappelletti, Monaldi and Filippeschi,[3] thou man without"
1097,CANTO VI.,"care: those already wretched, and these in dread. Come, cruel one,"
1098,CANTO VI.,"come, and see the distress of thy nobility, and cure their hurts; and"
1099,CANTO VI.,"thou shalt see Santafiora[4] how safe it is. Come to see thy Rome, that"
1100,CANTO VI.,"weeps, widowed and alone, and day and night cries, “My Caesar,"
1101,CANTO VI.,"wherefore dost thou not keep me company?” Come to see the people, how"
1102,CANTO VI.,"loving it is; and, if no pity for us move thee, come to be shamed by"
1103,CANTO VI.,"thine own renown! And if it be lawful for me, O Supreme Jove that wast"
1104,CANTO VI.,"on earth crucified for us, are thy just eyes turned aside elsewhere? Or"
1105,CANTO VI.,"is it preparation, that in the abyss of thy counsel thou art making for"
1106,CANTO VI.,some good utterly cut off from our perception? For the cities of Italy
1107,CANTO VI.,"are all full of tyrants, and every churl that comes playing the"

1116,CANTO VI.,"crowned. He was murdered by his nephew, John, called the parricide, in"
1117,CANTO VI.,"1308, at Konigsfelden. The successor of Albert was Henry VII. of"
1118,CANTO VI.,"Luxemborg, who came to Italy in 1311, was crowned at Rome in 1312, and"

1168,CANTO VII.,"had been buried by Octavian; I am Virgil, and for no other sin did I"

1178,CANTO VII.,"merit or what grace shows thee to me? If I am worthy to hear thy words,"
1179,CANTO VII.,"tell me if thou comest from Hell, and from what cloister.” “Through all"
1180,CANTO VII.,"the circles of the realm of woe,” replied he to him, “am I come hither;"
1181,CANTO VII.,"Power of Heaven moved me, and with it I come. Not by doing, but by not"
1182,CANTO VII.,"doing have I lost the sight of the high Sun whom thou desirest, and who"
1183,CANTO VII.,by me was known late. A place there is below not sad with torments but
1184,CANTO VII.,"with darkness only, where the lamentations sound not as wailings, but"
1185,CANTO VII.,are sighs; there stay I with the little innocents bitten by the teeth
1186,CANTO VII.,of death before they were exempt from human sin; there stay I with
1187,CANTO VII.,"those who were not vested with the three holy virtues, and without vice"
1188,CANTO VII.,knew the others and followed all of them.[1] But if thou knowest and
1189,CANTO VII.,"canst, give us some direction whereby we may come more speedily there"
1190,CANTO VII.,"where Purgatory has its true beginning.” He replied, “A certain place"
1191,CANTO VII.,is not set for us; it is permitted me to go upward and around; so far
1192,CANTO VII.,as I can go I join myself to thee as guide. But see how already the day
1193,CANTO VII.,"declines, and to go up by night is not possible; therefore it is well"
1194,CANTO VII.,to think of some fair sojourn. There are souls here on the right apart;
1195,CANTO VII.,"if thou consentest to me I will lead thee to them, and not without"
1196,CANTO VII.,"delight will they be known to thee.” “How is this?” was answered, “he"
1197,CANTO VII.,"who might wish to ascend by night, would he be hindered by another, or"
1198,CANTO VII.,would he not be able to ascend?” And the good Sordello drew his finger
1199,CANTO VII.,"on the ground, saying, “See, only this line thou couldst not pass after"
1200,CANTO VII.,set of sun; not because aught else save the nocturnal darkness would
1201,CANTO VII.,give hindrance to going up; that hampers the will with impotence.[2]
1202,CANTO VII.,"One could, indeed, in it[3] turn downward and walk the hillside"
1203,CANTO VII.,"wandering around, while the horizon holds the day shut up.” Then my"

1221,CANTO VII.,"here on earth. “Yonder,” said that shade, “will we go, where the"
1222,CANTO VII.,"hillside makes a lap of itself, and there will we await the new day.”"
1223,CANTO VII.,Between steep and level was a winding path that led us into a side of

1238,CANTO VII.,"Mantuan who had turned us thither, “desire not that among these I guide"
1239,CANTO VII.,you. From this bank ye will better become acquainted with the acts and
1240,CANTO VII.,"countenances of all of them, than received among them on the level"
1241,CANTO VII.,below. He who sits highest and has the semblance of having neglected
1242,CANTO VII.,"what he should have done, and who moves not his mouth to the others’"
1243,CANTO VII.,"songs, was Rudolph the Emperor, who might have healed the wounds that"
1244,CANTO VII.,"have slain Italy, so that slowly by another she is revived.[2] The"
1245,CANTO VII.,"next, who in appearance comforts him, ruled the land where the water"
1246,CANTO VII.,"rises that Moldau bears to Elbe, and Elbe to the sea. Ottocar was his"
1247,CANTO VII.,"name,[3] and in his swaddling clothes he was better far than bearded"
1248,CANTO VII.,"Wenceslaus, his son, whom luxury and idleness feed.[4] And that"
1249,CANTO VII.,"small-nosed one, who seems close in counsel with him who has so benign"
1250,CANTO VII.,"an aspect, died in flight and disflowering the lily;[5]  look there how"
1251,CANTO VII.,"he beats his breast. See the next who, sighing, has made a bed for his"
1252,CANTO VII.,cheek with his hand.[6] Father and father-in-law are they of the harm
1253,CANTO VII.,"of France; they know his vicious and foul life, and thence comes the"
1254,CANTO VII.,"grief that so pierces them. He who looks so large-limbed,[7] and who"
1255,CANTO VII.,"accords in singing with him of the masculine nose,[8] wore girt the"
1256,CANTO VII.,"cord of every worth, and if the youth that is sitting behind him had"
1257,CANTO VII.,"followed him as king, truly had worth gone from vase to vase, which"
1258,CANTO VII.,cannot be said of the other heirs: James and Frederick hold the realms;
1259,CANTO VII.,[9] the better heritage no one possesses. Rarely doth human goodness
1260,CANTO VII.,"rise through the branches, and this He wills who gives it, in order"
1261,CANTO VII.,that it may be asked from Him. To the large-nosed one also my words
1262,CANTO VII.,"apply not less than to the other, Peter, who is singing with him;"
1263,CANTO VII.,wherefore Apulia and Provence are grieving now.[10] The plant is as

1380,CANTO VIII.,light of the supernal grace does not shine directly upon it. But if the

1382,CANTO VIII.,"God, that aid will not be wanting. The prayer of the Church which is"
1383,CANTO VIII.,"recited after the hymn just cited has these words: “Visit, we pray"
1384,CANTO VIII.,"thee, O Lord, this abode, and drive far from it the snares of the"

1395,CANTO VIII.,"of their points. Green as leaflets just now born were their garments,"
1396,CANTO VIII.,"which, beaten and blown by their green pinions, they trailed behind."
1397,CANTO VIII.,"One came to stand a little above us, and the other descended on the"
1398,CANTO VIII.,"opposite bank, so that the people were contained between them. I"
1399,CANTO VIII.,"clearly discerned in them their blond heads, but on their faces the eye"
1400,CANTO VIII.,"was dazzled, as a faculty which is confounded by excess. “Both come"
1401,CANTO VIII.,"from the bosom of Mary,” said Sordello, “for guard of the valley,"
1402,CANTO VIII.,"because of the serpent that will come straightway.” Whereat I, who knew"

1412,CANTO VIII.,"Towards me he moved, and I moved towards him. Gentle Judge Nino,[2] how"

1415,CANTO VIII.,since thou camest to the foot of the mountain across the far waters?”
1416,CANTO VIII.,

1424,CANTO VIII.,"four districts, each of which was governed by one of the Pisan nobles,"
1425,CANTO VIII.,"under the title of Judge. Nino had held the judicature of Gallura,"

1431,CANTO VIII.,"morning, and I am in the first life, albeit in going thus, I may gain"
1432,CANTO VIII.,"the other.” And when my answer was heard, Sordello[1] and he drew"
1433,CANTO VIII.,"themselves back like folk suddenly bewildered, the one to Virgil, and"
1434,CANTO VIII.,"the other turned to one who was seated there, crying, “Up, Corrado,[2]"
1435,CANTO VIII.,"come to see what God through grace hath willed.” Then, turning to me,"
1436,CANTO VIII.,“By that singular gratitude thou owest unto Him who so hides His own
1437,CANTO VIII.,"first wherefore[3] that there is no ford to it, when thou shalt be"
1438,CANTO VIII.,"beyond the wide waves, say to my Joan, that for me she cry there where"
1439,CANTO VIII.,answer is given to the innocent. I do not think her mother[4] loves me
1440,CANTO VIII.,"longer, since she changed her white wimples,[5] which she, wretched,"
1441,CANTO VIII.,needs must desire again. Through her easily enough is comprehended how
1442,CANTO VIII.,"long the fire of love lasts in woman, if eye or touch does not often"
1443,CANTO VIII.,rekindle it. The viper[6] which leads afield the Milanese will not make
1444,CANTO VIII.,for her so fair a sepulture as the cock of Gallura would have done.”
1445,CANTO VIII.,"Thus he said, marked in his aspect with the stamp of that upright zeal"
1446,CANTO VIII.,which in due measure glows in the heart.
1447,CANTO VIII.,
1448,CANTO VIII.,[1] The sun was already hidden behind the mountain when Virgil and
1449,CANTO VIII.,Dante came upon Sordello. Sordello had not therefore seen that Dante

1479,CANTO VIII.,

1488,CANTO VIII.,"snake, perhaps such as gave to Eve the bitter food. Through the grass"
1489,CANTO VIII.,"and the flowers came the evil trail, turning from time to time its head"
1490,CANTO VIII.,"to its  back, licking like a beast that sleeks itself. I did not see,"
1491,CANTO VIII.,"and therefore cannot tell how the celestial falcons moved, but I saw"
1492,CANTO VIII.,well both one and the other in motion. Hearing the air cleft by their
1493,CANTO VIII.,"green wings the serpent fled, and the angels wheeled about, up to their"
1494,CANTO VIII.,stations flying back alike.
1495,CANTO VIII.,
1496,CANTO VIII.,"The shade which had drawn close to the Judge when he exclaimed, through"
1497,CANTO VIII.,all that assault had not for a moment loosed its gaze from me. “So may

1499,CANTO VIII.,"wax as is needed up to the enamelled summit,”[1] it began, “if thou"
1500,CANTO VIII.,"knowest true news of Valdimacra[2] or of the neighboring region, tell"
1501,CANTO VIII.,"it to me, for formerly I was great there. I was called Corrado"
1502,CANTO VIII.,"Malaspina; I am not the ancient,[3] but from him I am descended; to"
1503,CANTO VIII.,"mine own I bore the love which here is refined.” “Oh,” said I to him,"
1504,CANTO VIII.,"“through your lands I have never been, but where doth man dwell in all"
1505,CANTO VIII.,Europe that they are not renowned? The fame that honoreth your house
1506,CANTO VIII.,"proclaims its lords, proclaims its district, so that he knows of them"
1507,CANTO VIII.,"who never yet was there; and I swear to you, so may I go above, that"
1508,CANTO VIII.,your honored race doth not despoil itself of the praise of the purse

1557,CANTO IX.,
1558,CANTO IX.,"[1] By the concubine of old Tithonus, Dante seems to have intended the"
1559,CANTO IX.,"lunar Aurora, in distinction from the proper wife of Tithonus, Aurora,"
1560,CANTO IX.,"who precedes the rising Sun, and the meaning of these verses is that “"
1561,CANTO IX.,"the Aurora before moonrise was lighting up the eastern sky, the"
1562,CANTO IX.,"brilliant stars of the sign Scorpio were on the horizon, and, finally,"
1563,CANTO IX.,it was shortly after 8.30 P.M.” (Moore.) “The steps with which the

1570,CANTO IX.,"more a wanderer from the flesh and less captive to the thought, is in"
1571,CANTO IX.,"its visions almost divine,[2] in dream it seemed to me that I saw"
1572,CANTO IX.,"poised in the sky an eagle with feathers of gold, with wings"
1573,CANTO IX.,"widespread, and intent to stoop. And it seemed to me that I was"
1574,CANTO IX.,"there[3] where his own people were abandoned by Ganymede, when he was"
1575,CANTO IX.,"rapt to the supreme consistory. In myself I thought, “Perhaps this bird"
1576,CANTO IX.,"strikes only here through wont, and perhaps from other place disdains"
1577,CANTO IX.,"to carry anyone upward in his feet.” Then it seemed to me that, having"
1578,CANTO IX.,"wheeled a little, it descended terrible as a thunderbolt, and snatched"
1579,CANTO IX.,"me upwards far as the fire.[4] There it seemed that it and I burned,"
1580,CANTO IX.,and the imagined fire so scorched that of necessity the sleep was
1581,CANTO IX.,broken.

1603,CANTO IX.,"stole him away, sleeping in her arms, thither whence afterwards the"
1604,CANTO IX.,"Greeks withdrew him,[1]—than I started, as from my face sleep fled"
1605,CANTO IX.,"away; and I became pale, even as a man frightened turns to ice. At my"
1606,CANTO IX.,"side was my Comforter only, and the sun was now more than two hours"
1607,CANTO IX.,"high,[2] and my face was turned toward the sea. “Have no fear,” said my"
1608,CANTO IX.,"Lord; “be reassured, for we are at a good point; restrain not, but"
1609,CANTO IX.,increase all thy force. Thou art now arrived at Purgatory; see there
1610,CANTO IX.,"the cliff that closes it around; see the entrance, there where it"
1611,CANTO IX.,"appears divided. A while ago in the dawn that precedes the day, when"
1612,CANTO IX.,"thy soul was sleeping within thee, upon the flowers wherewith the place"
1613,CANTO IX.,"down yonder is adorned, came a lady, and said, “I am Lucia; let me take"
1614,CANTO IX.,this one who is sleeping; thus will I assist him along his way.’
1615,CANTO IX.,"Sordello remained, and the other gentle forms: she took thee, and when"
1616,CANTO IX.,"the day was bright, she came upward, and I along her footprints. Here"
1617,CANTO IX.,she laid thee down: and first her beautiful eyes showed me that open
1618,CANTO IX.,entrance; then she and slumber went away together.” Like a man that in
1619,CANTO IX.,"perplexity is reassured, and that alters his fear to confidence after"
1620,CANTO IX.,"the truth is disclosed to him, did I change; and when my Leader saw me"
1621,CANTO IX.,"without solicitude, up along the cliff he moved on, and I behind,"
1622,CANTO IX.,toward the height.

1627,CANTO IX.,"court of King Lycomedes, on the Island of Scyros, where, though"

1639,CANTO IX.,"(Hell, Canto II.) to aid Dante when he was astray in the wood, and who"

1647,CANTO IX.,underlies the imagery of the verse.
1648,CANTO IX.,
1649,CANTO IX.,
1650,CANTO IX.,The entrance within the gate of Purgatory is the assurance of
1651,CANTO IX.,"justification, which is the change of the soul from a state of sin to a"
1652,CANTO IX.,"state of justice or righteousness. Justification itself consists,"
1653,CANTO IX.,"according to St. Thomas Aquinas (Summa Theologica, Prima Secundae,"
1654,CANTO IX.,"quaest. cxiii. art. 6 and 8), of four parts: first, the infusion of"
1655,CANTO IX.,"grace; second, the turning of the free will to God through faith;"
1656,CANTO IX.,"third, the turning of the free will against sin; fourth, the remission"
1657,CANTO IX.,"of sin. It must be accompanied by the sacrament of penance, which"
1658,CANTO IX.,"consists of contrition, confession, and satisfaction by works of"
1659,CANTO IX.,righteousness.
1660,CANTO IX.,
1661,CANTO IX.,Outside the gate of Purgatory justification cannot be complete. The
1662,CANTO IX.,souls in the Ante-Purgatory typify those who have entered on the way
1663,CANTO IX.,"towards justification, but have not yet attained it. They undergo a"
1664,CANTO IX.,"period of mortification to sin, of deliberation, as St. Thomas Aquinas"
1665,CANTO IX.,says: “Contingit autem quandoque quod praecedit aliqua deliberatio quae
1666,CANTO IX.,non est do substantia justificationis sed via in justificationem.”
1667,CANTO IX.,"Summa Theol., l. c. art. 7."
1668,CANTO IX.,
1669,CANTO IX.,"We drew near to it, and reached such place that there, where at first"
1670,CANTO IX.,"there seemed to me a rift, like a cleft which divides a wall, I saw a"
1671,CANTO IX.,"gate, and three steps beneath for going to it of divers colors, and a"
1672,CANTO IX.,gatekeeper who as yet said not a word. And as I opened my eye there
1673,CANTO IX.,"more and more, I saw him sitting on the upper step, such in his face"
1674,CANTO IX.,"that I endured it not.[1] And he had in his hand a naked sword, which"
1675,CANTO IX.,so reflected the rays toward us that I often raised my sight in vain.
1676,CANTO IX.,"“Tell it from there, what would ye?” began he to say; “where is the"
1677,CANTO IX.,guide? Beware lest the coming up be harmful to you.” [2] “A lady from
1678,CANTO IX.,"Heaven with these things acquainted,” replied my Master to him, “only"
1679,CANTO IX.,"just now said to us, ‘Go thither, here is the gate.’” “And may she"
1680,CANTO IX.,"speed your progress in good,” began again the courteous gatekeeper,"
1681,CANTO IX.,“come forward then unto our steps.”
1682,CANTO IX.,
1683,CANTO IX.,[1] The angel at the gate appears to be the type of the priest who
1684,CANTO IX.,administers absolution.
1685,CANTO IX.,
1686,CANTO IX.,
1687,CANTO IX.,[2] Unless grace has been infused into the heart it is a sin to present
1688,CANTO IX.,one’s self as ready for the sacrament.
1689,CANTO IX.,
1690,CANTO IX.,
1691,CANTO IX.,Thither we came to the first great stair; it was of white marble so
1692,CANTO IX.,polished and smooth that I mirrored myself in it as I appear. The
1693,CANTO IX.,"second, of deeper hue than perse, was of a rough and scorched stone,"
1694,CANTO IX.,"cracked lengthwise and athwart. The third, which above lies massy,"
1695,CANTO IX.,seemed to me of porphyry as flaming red as blood that spirts forth from
1696,CANTO IX.,"a vein. Upon this the Angel of God held both his feet, seated upon the"
1697,CANTO IX.,threshold that seemed to me stone of adamant.[1] Up over the three
1698,CANTO IX.,"steps my Leader drew me with good will, saying, “Beg humbly that he"
1699,CANTO IX.,undo the lock.” Devoutly I threw myself at the holy feet; I besought
1700,CANTO IX.,for mercy’s sake that he would open for me; but first upon my breast I
1701,CANTO IX.,struck three times.[2] Seven P’s upon my forehead he inscribed with the
1702,CANTO IX.,"point of his sword,[3] and “See that thou wash these wounds when thou"
1703,CANTO IX.,"art within,” he said."
1704,CANTO IX.,
1705,CANTO IX.,"[1] The first step is the symbol of confession, the second of"
1706,CANTO IX.,"contrition, the third of satisfaction; the threshold of adamant may"
1707,CANTO IX.,perhaps signify the authority of the Church.
1708,CANTO IX.,
1709,CANTO IX.,
1710,CANTO IX.,"[2] Three times, in penitence for sins in thought, in word, and in"
1711,CANTO IX.,deed.
1712,CANTO IX.,
1713,CANTO IX.,
1714,CANTO IX.,"[3] The seven P’s stand for the seven so-called mortal sins,—Peccati,"
1715,CANTO IX.,"not specific acts, but the evil dispositions of the soul from which all"
1716,CANTO IX.,"evil deeds spring,—pride, envy, anger, sloth (accidia), avarice,"
1717,CANTO IX.,"gluttony, and lust. After justification these dispositions which"
1718,CANTO IX.,"already have been overcome, must be utterly removed from the soul."
1719,CANTO IX.,
1720,CANTO IX.,
1721,CANTO IX.,"Ashes or earth dug out dry would be of one color with his vestment, and"
1722,CANTO IX.,from beneath that he drew two keys. One was of gold and the other was
1723,CANTO IX.,of silver; first with the white and then with the yellow he so did to
1724,CANTO IX.,"the door, that I was content.[1] “Whenever one of these keys fails, and"
1725,CANTO IX.,"turns not rightly in the lock,” said he to us, “this passage doth not"
1726,CANTO IX.,open. More precious is one[2] but the other requires much art and wit
1727,CANTO IX.,"before it unlocks, because it is the one that disentangles the knot."
1728,CANTO IX.,From Peter I hold them; and he told me to err rather in opening than in
1729,CANTO IX.,"keeping shut, if but the people prostrate themselves at my feet.” Then"
1730,CANTO IX.,"he pushed the valve of the sacred gate, saying, “Enter, but I give you"
1731,CANTO IX.,warning that whoso looks behind returns outside.”[3] And when the
1732,CANTO IX.,"pivots of that sacred portal, which are of metal, sonorous and strong,"
1733,CANTO IX.,"were turned within their hinges, Tarpeia roared not so loud nor showed"
1734,CANTO IX.,"herself so harsh, when the good Metellus was taken from her, whereby"
1735,CANTO IX.,she afterwards remained lean.[4]
1736,CANTO IX.,
1737,CANTO IX.,"[1] The golden key is typical of the power to open, and the silver of"
1738,CANTO IX.,the knowledge to whom to open.
1739,CANTO IX.,
1740,CANTO IX.,
1741,CANTO IX.,"[2] The gold, more precious because the power of absolution was"
1742,CANTO IX.,purchased by the death of the Saviour.
1743,CANTO IX.,
1744,CANTO IX.,
1745,CANTO IX.,[3] For he who returns to his sins loses the Divine Grace.
1746,CANTO IX.,
1747,CANTO IX.,
1748,CANTO IX.,"[4] This roaring of the gate may, perhaps, be intended to enforce the"
1749,CANTO IX.,"last words of the angel, and may symbolize the voices of his own sins"
1750,CANTO IX.,as the sinner turns his back on them. When Caesar forced the doors of
1751,CANTO IX.,"the temple of Saturn on the Tarpeian rock, in order to lay hands on the"
1752,CANTO IX.,"sacred treasure of Rome, he was resisted by the tribune Metellus."
1753,CANTO IX.,
1754,CANTO IX.,
1755,CANTO IX.,"I turned away attentive to the first tone,[1] and it seemed to me I"
1756,CANTO IX.,heard “Te Deum laudamus”[2] in voices mingled with sweet sound. That
1757,CANTO IX.,which I heard gave me just such an impression as we are wont to receive
1758,CANTO IX.,"when people stand singing with an organ, and the words now are, now are"
1759,CANTO IX.,not caught.

1780,CANTO X.,[1] It is Dante’s doctrine that love is the motive of every act;
1781,CANTO X.,"rightly directed, of good deeds; perverted, of evil. See Canto XVII."
1782,CANTO X.,
1783,CANTO X.,
1784,CANTO X.,"We were ascending through a cloven rock, which moved on one side and on"
1785,CANTO X.,"the other, even as the wave retreats and approaches. “Here must be used"
1786,CANTO X.,"a little art,” began my Leader, “in keeping close, now here, now there"
1787,CANTO X.,to the side which recedes.”[1] And this made our progress so slow that
1788,CANTO X.,"the waning disk of the moon regained its bed to go to rest, before we"
1789,CANTO X.,had come forth from that needle’s eye. But when we were free and open
1790,CANTO X.,"above, where the mountain backward withdraws,[2] I weary, and both"
1791,CANTO X.,"uncertain of our way, we stopped upon a level more solitary than roads"
1792,CANTO X.,"through deserts. The space from its edge, where it borders the void, to"
1793,CANTO X.,"the foot of the high bank which rises only, a human body would measure"
1794,CANTO X.,"in three lengths; and as far as my eye could stretch its wings, now on"
1795,CANTO X.,"the left and now on the right side, such did this cornice seem to me."
1796,CANTO X.,Thereon our feet had not yet moved when I perceived that bank round
1797,CANTO X.,"about, which, being perpendicular, allowed no ascent, to be of white"
1798,CANTO X.,"marble and adorned with such carvings, that not Polycletus merely but"
1799,CANTO X.,Nature would be put to shame there.
1800,CANTO X.,
1801,CANTO X.,"[1] The path was a narrow, steep zigzag, which, as it receded on one"
1802,CANTO X.,"side and the other, afforded the better foothold."

1808,CANTO X.,"The Angel who came to earth with the announcement of the peace, wept"
1809,CANTO X.,"for for many years, which opened Heaven from its long interdict,"
1810,CANTO X.,appeared before us here carved in a sweet attitude so truly that he did
1811,CANTO X.,not seem an image that is silent. One would have sworn that he was
1812,CANTO X.,saying “Ave;” for there was she imaged who turned the key to open the
1813,CANTO X.,"exalted love. And in her action she had these words impressed, “Ecce"
1814,CANTO X.,ancilla Dei!”[1] as exactly as a shape is sealed in wax.
1815,CANTO X.,
1816,CANTO X.,[1] “Behold the handmaid of the Lord!”
1817,CANTO X.,
1818,CANTO X.,
1819,CANTO X.,"“Keep not thy mind only on one place,” said the sweet Master, who had"
1820,CANTO X.,me on that side where people have their heart. Wherefore I moved my
1821,CANTO X.,"eyes and saw behind Mary, upon that side where he was who was moving"
1822,CANTO X.,"me, another story displayed upon the rock; whereupon I passed Virgil"
1823,CANTO X.,and drew near so that it might be set before my eyes. There in the very
1824,CANTO X.,"marble was carved the cart and the oxen drawing the holy ark, because"
1825,CANTO X.,of which men fear an office not given in charge.[1] In front appeared
1826,CANTO X.,"people; and all of them, divided in seven choirs, of two of my senses"
1827,CANTO X.,"made the one say “NO,” the other “YES, THEY ARE SINGING.”[2]  In like"
1828,CANTO X.,"manner, by the smoke of the incense that was imaged there, mine eyes"
1829,CANTO X.,"and nose were made in YES and NO discordant. There, preceding the"
1830,CANTO X.,"blessed vessel, dancing, girt up, was the humble Psalmist, and more and"
1831,CANTO X.,"less than king was he in that proceeding. Opposite, figured at a window"
1832,CANTO X.,"of a great palace, Michal was looking on even as a lady scornful and"
1833,CANTO X.,troubled.[3]
1834,CANTO X.,
1835,CANTO X.,"[1] “And they set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of"
1836,CANTO X.,the house.. . and Uzzah and Ahio drave the new cart….and when they came
1837,CANTO X.,"to Nachon’s threshing-floor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of"
1838,CANTO X.,"God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it. And the anger of the"
1839,CANTO X.,"Lord was kindled against Uzzah, and God smote him there for his error;"
1840,CANTO X.,"and there he died by the ark of God.” 2 Samuel, vi. 4-7."
1841,CANTO X.,
1842,CANTO X.,
1843,CANTO X.,"[2] The hearing said “No,” the sight said “Yes.”"
1844,CANTO X.,
1845,CANTO X.,
1846,CANTO X.,[3] “So David went and brought up the ark of God… into the city of
1847,CANTO X.,David with gladness. And when they that bare the ark of the Lord had
1848,CANTO X.,gone six paces he sacrificed oxen and fatlings. And David danced before
1849,CANTO X.,the Lord with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.
1850,CANTO X.,So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord
1851,CANTO X.,"with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet. And as the ark of the"
1852,CANTO X.,"Lord came into the city of David, Michal, Saul’s daughter, looked"
1853,CANTO X.,"through a window, and saw King David leaping and dancing before the"
1854,CANTO X.,"Lord; and she despised him in her heart.” 2 Samuel, vi. 12-16."
1855,CANTO X.,
1856,CANTO X.,
1857,CANTO X.,I moved my feet from the place where I was standing to look from near
1858,CANTO X.,at another story which behind Michal was shining white on me. Here was
1859,CANTO X.,"storied the high glory of the Roman prince, whose worth incited Gregory"
1860,CANTO X.,to his great victory:[1] I speak of Trajan the emperor; and a poor
1861,CANTO X.,widow was at his bridle in attitude of weeping and of grief. Round
1862,CANTO X.,"about him there seemed a press and throng of knights, and the eagles in"
1863,CANTO X.,the gold above him to the sight were moving in the wind. The wretched
1864,CANTO X.,"woman among all these seemed to be saying, “Lord, do vengeance for me"
1865,CANTO X.,"for my son who is slain, whereat I am broken-hearted.” And he to answer"
1866,CANTO X.,"her, “Now wait till I return;” and she, “My Lord,”—like one in whom"
1867,CANTO X.,"grief is hasty,—“if thou return not?” And he, “He who shall be where I"
1868,CANTO X.,"am will do it for thee.” And she, “What will the good deed of another"
1869,CANTO X.,"be to thee if thou art mindless of thine own?” Whereon he, “Now comfort"
1870,CANTO X.,thee; for it behoves that I discharge my own duty ere I go; justice
1871,CANTO X.,"requires it, and pity constrains me.” He who hath never seen new thing"
1872,CANTO X.,"[2] had produced that visible speech, novel to us, since on earth it is"
1873,CANTO X.,not found.
1874,CANTO X.,
1875,CANTO X.,[1] This legend of Trajan had great vogue during the Middle Ages. It
1876,CANTO X.,"was believed that Pope Gregory the Great interceded for him, praying"
1877,CANTO X.,that he might be delivered from Hell; “then God because of these
1878,CANTO X.,prayers drew that soul from pain and put it into glory.” This was
1879,CANTO X.,"Gregory’s great victory. See Paradise, XX., p. 131."

1883,CANTO X.,
1884,CANTO X.,
1885,CANTO X.,While I was delighting me with regarding the images of such great
1886,CANTO X.,"humilities, and for their Maker’s sake dear to behold, “Lo, on this"
1887,CANTO X.,"side many people, but they make few steps,” murmured the Poet. “They"
1888,CANTO X.,will put us on the way to the high stairs.” My eyes that were intent on
1889,CANTO X.,"looking in order to see novelties whereof they are fain, in turning"
1890,CANTO X.,toward him were not slow.
1891,CANTO X.,
1892,CANTO X.,"I would not, indeed, Reader, that thou be dismayed at thy good purpose,"
1893,CANTO X.,through hearing how God wills that the debt be paid. Attend not to the
1894,CANTO X.,form of the suffering; think on what follows; think that at worst
1895,CANTO X.,beyond the Great Judgment it cannot go!
1896,CANTO X.,
1897,CANTO X.,"I began, “Master, that which I see moving toward us, seems to me not"
1898,CANTO X.,"persons, but what I know not, my look is so in vain.” And he to me,"
1899,CANTO X.,"“The heavy condition of their torment so presses them to earth, that"
1900,CANTO X.,"mine own eyes at first had contention with it. But look fixedly there,"
1901,CANTO X.,and disentangle with thy sight that which cometh beneath those stones;
1902,CANTO X.,now thou canst discern how each is smitten.”
1903,CANTO X.,
1904,CANTO X.,"O proud Christians, wretched weary ones, who, diseased in vision of the"
1905,CANTO X.,"mind, have confidence in backward steps, are ye not aware that we are"

1907,CANTO X.,"without defence? Why doth your mind float up aloft, since ye are as it"

1912,CANTO X.,"makes a real pang rise in him who sees it, thus fashioned saw I these"
1913,CANTO X.,when I gave good heed. True it is that they were more or less
1914,CANTO X.,contracted according as they had more or less upon their backs; and he
1915,CANTO X.,"who had most patience in his looks, weeping, appeared to say, “I can no"

1951,CANTO XI.,"cornice, purging away the mists of the world. If good they ask for us"

1953,CANTO XI.,a good root for their will? Truly we ought to aid them to wash away the

1963,CANTO XI.,was not manifest from whom came the words which they returned to these
1964,CANTO XI.,"that he whom I was following had spoken, but it was said, “To the right"
1965,CANTO XI.,"hand along the bank come ye with us, and ye will find the pass possible"
1966,CANTO XI.,for a living person to ascend. And if I were not hindered by the stone
1967,CANTO XI.,"which tames my proud neck, wherefore I needs must carry my face low, I"
1968,CANTO XI.,"would look at that one who is still alive and is not named, to see if I"
1969,CANTO XI.,"know him, and to make him pitiful of this burden. I was Italian, and"
1970,CANTO XI.,born of a great Tuscan; Guglielmo Aldobrandesco was my father: I know
1971,CANTO XI.,not if his name was ever with you.[1] The ancient blood and the gallant
1972,CANTO XI.,"deeds of my ancestors made me so arrogant that, not thinking on the"
1973,CANTO XI.,"common mother, I held every man in scorn to such extreme that I died"
1974,CANTO XI.,"therefor, as the Sienese know, and every child in Campagnatico knows"
1975,CANTO XI.,"it. I am Omberto: and not only unto me Pride doth harm, for all my"
1976,CANTO XI.,kinsfolk bath she dragged with her into calamity; and here must I heap
1977,CANTO XI.,"this weight on her account till God be satisfied,—here among the dead,"
1978,CANTO XI.,since I did it not among the living.”
1979,CANTO XI.,
1980,CANTO XI.,[1] The Aldobrandeschi were the counts of Santa Fiore (see Canto VI.)
1981,CANTO XI.,"in the Sienese Maremma. Little is known of them, but that they were in"
1982,CANTO XI.,constant feud with Siena. The one who speaks was murdered in his own
1983,CANTO XI.,"stronghold of Campagnatico, in 1259."
1984,CANTO XI.,
1985,CANTO XI.,
1986,CANTO XI.,"Listening, I bent down my face; and one of them, not he who was"
1987,CANTO XI.,"speaking, twisted himself under the weight that hampers him; and he saw"
1988,CANTO XI.,"me, and recognized me and called out, keeping his eyes with effort"
1989,CANTO XI.,"fixed on me, who was going along all stooping with him.[1] “Oh,” said I"
1990,CANTO XI.,"to him, “art thou not Oderisi, the honor of Gubbio, and the honor of"
1991,CANTO XI.,"that art which in Paris is called illumination?” “Brother,” said he,"
1992,CANTO XI.,“more smiling are the leaves that Franco of Bologna pencils; the honor
1993,CANTO XI.,"is now all his, and mine in part.[2] Truly I should not have been so"
1994,CANTO XI.,"courteous while I lived, because of the great desire of excelling"
1995,CANTO XI.,whereon my heart was intent. Of such pride here is paid the fee; and
1996,CANTO XI.,"yet I should not be here, were it not that, still having power to sin,"
1997,CANTO XI.,I turned me unto God. Oh vainglory of human powers! how little lasts
1998,CANTO XI.,"the green upon the top, if it be not followed by dull ages.[3] Cimabue"
1999,CANTO XI.,"thought to hold the field in painting, and now Giotto has the cry, so"
2000,CANTO XI.,that the fame of him is obscured. In like manner one Guido hath taken
2001,CANTO XI.,from the other the glory of the language; and he perhaps is born who
2002,CANTO XI.,shall drive both one and the other from the nest.[4] Worldly renown is
2003,CANTO XI.,"naught but a breath of wind, which now comes hence and now comes"
2004,CANTO XI.,"thence, and changes name because it changes quarter. What more fame"
2005,CANTO XI.,"shalt thou have, if thou strippest old flesh from thee, than if thou"
2006,CANTO XI.,"hadst died ere thou hadst left the pap and the chink,[5] before a"
2007,CANTO XI.,thousand years have passed?—which is a shorter space compared to the
2008,CANTO XI.,eternal than a movement of the eyelids to the circle that is slowest
2009,CANTO XI.,turned in Heaven. With him who takes so little of the road in front of
2010,CANTO XI.,"me, all Tuscany resounded, and now he scarce is lisped of in Siena,"
2011,CANTO XI.,"where he was lord when the Florentine rage was destroyed,[6] which at"
2012,CANTO XI.,"that time was proud, as now it is prostitute. Your reputation is color"
2013,CANTO XI.,"of grass that comes and goes, and he[7] discolors it through whom it"
2014,CANTO XI.,"came up fresh from the earth.” And I to him, “Thy true speech brings"
2015,CANTO XI.,"good humility to my heart, and thou allayest a great swelling in me;"
2016,CANTO XI.,"but who is he of whom thou now wast speaking?” “He is,” he answered,"
2017,CANTO XI.,"“Provinzan Salvani;[8] and he is here, because he was presumptuous in"
2018,CANTO XI.,bringing all Siena to his hands. He has gone thus—and he goes without
2019,CANTO XI.,"repose—ever since he died: such money doth he pay in satisfaction, who"
2020,CANTO XI.,"is on earth too daring.” And I, “If that spirit who awaits the verge of"
2021,CANTO XI.,"life ere he repents abides there below, and unless good prayer further"
2022,CANTO XI.,"him ascends not hither, ere as much time pass us he lived, how has this"
2023,CANTO XI.,"coining been granted unto him?” “When he was living most renowned,”"
2024,CANTO XI.,"said he, “laying aside all shame, of his own accord he planted himself"
2025,CANTO XI.,"in the Campo of Siena,[9] and there, to draw his friend from the"
2026,CANTO XI.,"punishment he was enduring in the prison of Charles, brought himself to"
2027,CANTO XI.,"tremble in every vein. More I will not say, and I know that I speak"
2028,CANTO XI.,"darkly; but little time will pass, before thy neighbors will so act"
2029,CANTO XI.,that thou wilt he able to gloss it.[10] This deed released him from
2030,CANTO XI.,those limits.”[11]

2318,CANTO XIII.,"table of love. The first voice that passed flying, “Virum non"
2319,CANTO XIII.,"habent,”[1] loudly said, and went on behind us reiterating it. And"
2320,CANTO XIII.,"before it had become quite inaudible through distance, another passed"
2321,CANTO XIII.,"by, crying, “I am Orestes,” [2] and also did not stay. “O Father,” said"
2322,CANTO XIII.,"I, “what voices are these?” and even as I was asking, lo! the third,"
2323,CANTO XIII.,"saying, “Love them from whom ye have had wrong.” And the good Master:"
2324,CANTO XIII.,"“This circle scourges the sin of envy, and therefore from love are"

2330,CANTO XIII.,and saw shades with cloaks in color not different from the stone. And
2331,CANTO XIII.,"when we were a little further forward, I heard them crying, “Mary, pray"

2349,CANTO XIII.,were drawn from my eyes by heavy grief. They seemed to me covered with
2350,CANTO XIII.,"coarse haircloth, and one supported the other with his shoulders, and"
2351,CANTO XIII.,"all were supported by the bank. Thus the blind, who lack subsistence,"
2352,CANTO XIII.,"stand at pardons[1] to beg for what they need, and one bows his head"
2353,CANTO XIII.,"upon another, so that pity may quickly be moved in others, not only by"
2354,CANTO XIII.,"the sound of the words, but by the sight which implores no less. And as"
2355,CANTO XIII.,"to the blind the sun profits not, so to the shades, there where I was"
2356,CANTO XIII.,"now speaking, the light of Heaven wills not to make largess of itself;"
2357,CANTO XIII.,for a wire of iron pierces and sews up the eyelids of all; even as is

2369,CANTO XIII.,
2370,CANTO XIII.,Virgil was coming with me on that side of the cornice from which one
2371,CANTO XIII.,"may fall, because it is encircled by no rim. On the other side of me"
2372,CANTO XIII.,"were the devout shades, that through the horrible stitches were"
2373,CANTO XIII.,pressing out the tears so that they bathed their cheeks. I turned me to
2374,CANTO XIII.,"them, and, “O folk secure,” I began, “of seeing the lofty light which"
2375,CANTO XIII.,"alone your desire holds in its care, may grace speedily dissolve the"
2376,CANTO XIII.,scum of your consciences so that the stream of memory through them may
2377,CANTO XIII.,"descend clear,[1] tell me, for it will be gracious and dear to me, if"
2378,CANTO XIII.,"there be a soul here among you that is Latin, and perhaps it will be"
2379,CANTO XIII.,"good for him if I learn it.” “O my brother, each is a citizen of one"

2381,CANTO XIII.,This it seemed to me to hear for answer somewhat further on than where
2382,CANTO XIII.,I was standing; wherefore I made myself heard still more that way.
2383,CANTO XIII.,"Among the others I saw a shade that was expectant in look; and, if any"
2384,CANTO XIII.,"one should wish to ask, How?—like a blind man it was lifting up its"
2385,CANTO XIII.,"chin. “Spirit,” said I, “that humblest thyself in order to ascend, if"
2386,CANTO XIII.,"thou art that one which answered me, make thyself known to me either by"
2387,CANTO XIII.,"place or by name.” “I was a Sienese,” it answered, “and with these"
2388,CANTO XIII.,"others I cleanse here my guilty life, weeping to Him that He grant"
2389,CANTO XIII.,"Himself to us. Sapient I was not, although I was called Sapia, and I"
2390,CANTO XIII.,was far more glad of others’ harm than of my own good fortune. And that
2391,CANTO XIII.,"thou mayst not believe that I deceive thee, bear if I was foolish as I"
2392,CANTO XIII.,"tell thee. The arch of my years already descending, my fellow-citizens"
2393,CANTO XIII.,"were joined in battle near to Colle[4] with their adversaries, and I"
2394,CANTO XIII.,"prayed God for that which He willed. They were routed there, and turned"
2395,CANTO XIII.,"into the bitter passes of flight; and I, seeing the pursuit,"
2396,CANTO XIII.,experienced a joy unmatched by any other; so much that I turned upward
2397,CANTO XIII.,"my audacious face, crying out to God, ‘Now no more I fear thee;’ as the"
2398,CANTO XIII.,blackbird doth because of a little fair weather. At the very end of my
2399,CANTO XIII.,life I desired peace with God; and even yet my debt would not be
2400,CANTO XIII.,"lessened by penitence,[5] had it not been that Pier Pettinagno,[6] who"
2401,CANTO XIII.,"out of charity was sorry for me, held me in memory in his holy prayers."
2402,CANTO XIII.,"But thou, who art thou that goest asking of our conditions, and bearest"
2403,CANTO XIII.,"thine eyes loose as I think, and breathing dost speak?” “My eyes,” said"
2404,CANTO XIII.,"I, “will yet be taken from me here but a little time, for small is the"
2405,CANTO XIII.,offence committed through their being turned with envy. Far greater is
2406,CANTO XIII.,"the fear, with which my soul is in suspense, of the torment beneath,"
2407,CANTO XIII.,"and already the load down there weighs upon me. And she to me, “Who"
2408,CANTO XIII.,"then hath led thee here up among us, if thou thinkest to return below?”"
2409,CANTO XIII.,"And I, “This one who is with me, and says not a word: and I am alive;"
2410,CANTO XIII.,"and therefore ask of me, spirit elect, if thou wouldst that I should"
2411,CANTO XIII.,"yet move for thee on earth my mortal feet.” “Oh, this is so strange a"
2412,CANTO XIII.,"thing to hear,” she replied, “that it is great sign that God loves"
2413,CANTO XIII.,thee; therefore assist me sometimes with thy prayer. And I beseech
2414,CANTO XIII.,"thee, by that which thou most desirest, if ever thou tread the earth of"

2468,CANTO XIV.,"ask him; and sweetly, so that he may speak, accost him.” Thus two"
2469,CANTO XIV.,"spirits, leaning one to the other, discoursed of me there on the right"
2470,CANTO XIV.,"hand, then turned up their faces to speak to me. And one of them said,"
2471,CANTO XIV.,"“O soul that still fixed in thy body goest on toward heaven, for"
2472,CANTO XIV.,"charity console us, and tell us whence thou comest, and who thou art;"
2473,CANTO XIV.,"for thou makest us so marvel at this thy grace, as needs must a thing"
2474,CANTO XIV.,"that never was before.” And I, “Through mid Tuscany there wanders a"
2475,CANTO XIV.,"little stream, that has its rise on Falterona,[2] and a hundred miles"
2476,CANTO XIV.,of coarse does not suffice it. From thereupon I bring this body. To
2477,CANTO XIV.,"tell you who I am would be to speak in vain, for my name as yet makes"
2478,CANTO XIV.,"no great sound.” “If I grasp aright thy meaning with my understanding,”"
2479,CANTO XIV.,"then replied to me he who had spoken first, “thou speakest of the"
2480,CANTO XIV.,"Arno.” And the other said to him, “Why did he conceal the name of that"
2481,CANTO XIV.,"river, even as one does of horrible things?” And the shade of whom this"
2482,CANTO XIV.,"was asked, delivered itself thus, “I know not, but truly it is fit that"
2483,CANTO XIV.,"the name of such a valley perish, for from its source (where the rugged"
2484,CANTO XIV.,"mountain chain, from which Pelorus[3] is cut off, is so teeming that in"
2485,CANTO XIV.,"few places it passes beyond that mark), far as there where it gives"
2486,CANTO XIV.,back in restoration that which heaven dries up of the sea (wherefrom
2487,CANTO XIV.,"the rivers have what flows in them), virtue is driven away as an enemy"
2488,CANTO XIV.,"by all men, like a snake, either through misfortune of the place, or"
2489,CANTO XIV.,through evil habit that incites them. Wherefore the inhabitants of the
2490,CANTO XIV.,wretched valley have so changed their nature that it seems as though
2491,CANTO XIV.,"Circe had had them in her feeding. Among foul hogs,[4] more fit for"
2492,CANTO XIV.,"acorns than for other food made for human use, it first directs its"
2493,CANTO XIV.,"poor path. Then, coming down, it finds curs more snarling, than their"
2494,CANTO XIV.,"power warrants,[5] and at them disdainfully it twists its muzzle.[6] It"
2495,CANTO XIV.,"goes on falling, and the more it swells so much the more the accursed"
2496,CANTO XIV.,and ill-fated ditch finds the dogs becoming wolves.[7] Descending then
2497,CANTO XIV.,"through many hollow gulfs, it finds foxes[8] so full of fraud, that"
2498,CANTO XIV.,they fear not that wit may entrap them. Nor will I leave to speak
2499,CANTO XIV.,though another hear me: and well it will be for this one if hereafter
2500,CANTO XIV.,he mind him of that which a true spirit discloses to me.

2818,CANTO XVI.,which covered us there; so that my eye endured not to stay open[1]
2819,CANTO XVI.,wherefore my sage and trusty Escort drew to my side and offered me his
2820,CANTO XVI.,"shoulder. Even as a blind man goes behind his guide, in order not to"
2821,CANTO XVI.,"stray, and not to butt against anything that may hurt or perhaps kill"
2822,CANTO XVI.,"him, I went along, through the bitter and foul air, listening to my"
2823,CANTO XVI.,"Leader, who was ever saying, “Take care that thou be not cut off from"
2824,CANTO XVI.,me.”
2825,CANTO XVI.,
2826,CANTO XVI.,[1] The gloom and the smoke symbolize the effects of anger on the soul.
2827,CANTO XVI.,
2828,CANTO XVI.,
2829,CANTO XVI.,"I heard voices, and each appeared to be praying for peace and mercy to"
2830,CANTO XVI.,the Lamb of God that taketh sins away. Only “Agnus Dei[1] were their
2831,CANTO XVI.,"exordiums: one word there was in all, and one measure; so that among"
2832,CANTO XVI.,"them seemed entire concord. “Are these spirits, Master, that I hear?”"
2833,CANTO XVI.,"said I. And he to me, “Thou apprehendest truly; and they go loosening"
2834,CANTO XVI.,"the knot of anger.” “Now who art thou that cleavest our smoke, and yet"
2835,CANTO XVI.,dost speak of us even as if thou didst still divide the time by
2836,CANTO XVI.,"calends?” [2] Thus by one voice was said: whereon my Master said,"
2837,CANTO XVI.,"“Reply, and ask if by this way one goeth up.” And I, “O creature, that"
2838,CANTO XVI.,"cleansest thyself in order to return beautiful unto Him who made thee,"
2839,CANTO XVI.,"a marvel shalt thou hear if thou accompanyest me.” “I will follow thee,"
2840,CANTO XVI.,"so far as is permitted me,” it replied, “and if the smoke allows not"
2841,CANTO XVI.,"seeing, in its stead hearing shall keep us joined.” Then I began, “With"
2842,CANTO XVI.,"that swathing band which death unbinds I go upward, and I came hither"
2843,CANTO XVI.,through the infernal anguish. And if God bath so enclosed me in His
2844,CANTO XVI.,grace that He wills that I should see His court by a mode wholly out of
2845,CANTO XVI.,"modern usage, conceal not from me who thou wert before thy death, but"
2846,CANTO XVI.,"tell it to me, and tell me if I am going rightly to the pass; and let"
2847,CANTO XVI.,"thy words be our guides.” “Lombard I was, and was called Marco; the"
2848,CANTO XVI.,"world I knew, and that worth I loved, toward which every one hath now"
2849,CANTO XVI.,"unbent his bow. For mounting thou art going rightly.” Thus he replied,"
2850,CANTO XVI.,"and added, “I pray thee that thou pray for me when thou shalt he"
2851,CANTO XVI.,"above.” And I to him, “I pledge my faith to thee to do that which thou"
2852,CANTO XVI.,"askest of me; but I am bursting inwardly with a doubt, if I free not"
2853,CANTO XVI.,"myself of it; at first it was simple, and now it is made double by thy"
2854,CANTO XVI.,"words which make certain to me, here as elsewhere, that wherewith I"
2855,CANTO XVI.,couple it.[3] The world is indeed as utterly deserted by every virtue
2856,CANTO XVI.,"as thou declarest to me, and with iniquity is big and covered; but I"
2857,CANTO XVI.,"pray that thou point out to me the cause, so that I may see it, and"
2858,CANTO XVI.,"that I may show it to others; for one sets it in the heavens, and one"
2859,CANTO XVI.,here below.”

2868,CANTO XVI.,"[3] The doubt was occasioned by Guido del Duca’s words (Canto XV.), in"
2869,CANTO XVI.,"regard to the prevalence of evil in Tuscany, arising either from"
2870,CANTO XVI.,"misfortune of the place, or through the bad habits of men. The fact of"
2871,CANTO XVI.,the iniquity of men was now reaffirmed by Marco Lombardo; Dante accepts
2872,CANTO XVI.,"the fact as certain, and his doubt is coupled with it."

2874,CANTO XVI.,
2875,CANTO XVI.,"A deep sigh that grief wrung into “Ay me!” he first sent forth, and"
2876,CANTO XVI.,"then began, “Brother, the world is blind, and thou forsooth comest from"
2877,CANTO XVI.,"it. Ye who are living refer every cause upward to the heavens only, as"
2878,CANTO XVI.,"if they of necessity moved all things with themselves. If this were so,"
2879,CANTO XVI.,"free will would be destroyed in you, and there would be no justice in"
2880,CANTO XVI.,"having joy for good, and grief for evil. The heavens initiate your"
2881,CANTO XVI.,"movements: I do not say all of them; but, supposing that I said it,"
2882,CANTO XVI.,"light for good and for evil is given to you; and free will, which, if"
2883,CANTO XVI.,"it endure fatigue in the first battles with the heavens, afterwards, if"
2884,CANTO XVI.,"it be well nurtured, conquers everything. To a greater force, and to a"
2885,CANTO XVI.,"better nature, ye, free, are subjected, and that creates the mind in"
2886,CANTO XVI.,"you, which the heavens have not in their charge.’ Therefore if the"
2887,CANTO XVI.,"present world goes astray, in you is the cause, in you let it be"
2888,CANTO XVI.,sought; and of this I will now be a true informant for thee.
2889,CANTO XVI.,
2890,CANTO XVI.,"[1] The soul of man is the direct creation of God, and is in immediate"
2891,CANTO XVI.,"subjection to His power; it is not in charge of the Heavens, and its"
2892,CANTO XVI.,will is free to resist their mingled and imperfect influences.
2893,CANTO XVI.,
2894,CANTO XVI.,
2895,CANTO XVI.,"“Forth from the hand of Him who delights in it ere it exist, like to a"
2896,CANTO XVI.,"little maid who, weeping and smiling, wantons childishly, issues the"
2897,CANTO XVI.,"simple little soul, which knows nothing, save that, proceeding from a"
2898,CANTO XVI.,"glad Maker, it willingly turns to that which allures it. Of trivial"
2899,CANTO XVI.,good at first it tastes the savor; by this it is deceived and runs
2900,CANTO XVI.,"after it, if guide or bridle bend not its love. Wherefore it was"
2901,CANTO XVI.,needful to impose law as a bridle; needful to have a king who could
2902,CANTO XVI.,"discern at least the tower of the true city. The laws exist, but who"
2903,CANTO XVI.,set hand to them? Not one: because the shepherd who is in advance can
2904,CANTO XVI.,"ruminate, but has not his hoofs divided?[1] Wherefore the people, who"
2905,CANTO XVI.,"see their guide only at that good[2] whereof they are greedy, feed upon"
2906,CANTO XVI.,"that, and seek no further. Well canst thou see that the evil leading is"
2907,CANTO XVI.,"the cause that has made the world guilty, and not nature which in you"
2908,CANTO XVI.,"may be corrupted. Rome, which made the world good, was wont to have two"
2909,CANTO XVI.,"Suns,[3] which made visible both one road and the other, that of the"
2910,CANTO XVI.,world and that of God. One has extinguished the other; and the sword is
2911,CANTO XVI.,"joined to the crozier; and the two together must of necessity go ill,"
2912,CANTO XVI.,"because, being joined, one feareth not the other. If thou believest rue"
2913,CANTO XVI.,"not, consider the grain,[4] for every herb is known by its seed."
2914,CANTO XVI.,
2915,CANTO XVI.,"[1] The shepherd who precedes the flock, and should lead it aright, is"
2916,CANTO XVI.,the Pope. A mystical interpretation of the injunction upon the children
2917,CANTO XVI.,"of Israel (Leviticus, xi.) in regard to clean and unclean beasts was"
2918,CANTO XVI.,familiar to the schoolmen. St. Augustine expounds the cloven hoof as
2919,CANTO XVI.,"symbolic of right conduct, because it does not easily slip, and the"
2920,CANTO XVI.,chewing of the cud as signifying the meditation of wisdom. Dante seems
2921,CANTO XVI.,"here to mean that the Pope has the true doctrine, but makes not the"
2922,CANTO XVI.,true use of it for his own guidance and the government of the world.

3053,CANTO XVII.,"before the sun which weighs down our sight, and by excess veils its own"
3054,CANTO XVII.,"shape, so here my power failed. “This is a divine spirit who directs"
3055,CANTO XVII.,"us, without our asking, on the way to go up, and with his own light"
3056,CANTO XVII.,conceals himself. He does for us as a man doth for himself; for he who

3059,CANTO XVII.,"to ascend ere it grows dark, for after, it would not be possible until"
3060,CANTO XVII.,the day returns.” Thus said my Guide; and I and he turned our steps to
3061,CANTO XVII.,"a stairway. And soon as I was on the first step, near use I felt a"
3062,CANTO XVII.,"motion as of wings, and a fanning on my face,[1] and I heard said,"

3075,CANTO XVII.,were stayed fast even as a ship that arrives at the shore. And I
3076,CANTO XVII.,"listened a little, if I might hear anything in the new circle. Then I"
3077,CANTO XVII.,"turned to my Master, and said, “My sweet Father, say what offence is"
3078,CANTO XVII.,"purged here in the circle where we are: if the feet are stopped, let"
3079,CANTO XVII.,"not thy discourse stop.” And he to me, “The love of good, less than it"

3111,CANTO XVII.,of one s neighbor; and in three modes is this love born within your

3172,CANTO XVIII.,"The lofty Teacher had put an end to his discourse, and looked attentive"
3173,CANTO XVIII.,"on my face to see if I appeared content; and I, whom a fresh thirst"
3174,CANTO XVIII.,"already was goading, was silent outwardly, and within was saying,"
3175,CANTO XVIII.,“Perhaps the too much questioning I make annoys him.” But that true
3176,CANTO XVIII.,"Father, who perceived the timid wish which did not disclose itself, by"
3177,CANTO XVIII.,"speaking gave me hardihood to speak. Then I, “My sight is so vivified"
3178,CANTO XVIII.,in thy light that I discern clearly all that thy discourse may imply or
3179,CANTO XVIII.,"declare: therefore I pray thee, sweet Father dear, that thou"
3180,CANTO XVIII.,demonstrate to me the love to which thou referrest every good action
3181,CANTO XVIII.,"and its contrary.” “Direct,” he said, “toward me the keen eyes of the"
3182,CANTO XVIII.,"understanding, and the error of the blind who make themselves leaders"
3183,CANTO XVIII.,"will be manifest to thee. The mind, which is created apt to love, is"
3184,CANTO XVIII.,"mobile unto everything that pleases, soon as by pleasure it is roused"
3185,CANTO XVIII.,to action. Your faculty of apprehension draws an image from a real
3186,CANTO XVIII.,"existence, and within you displays it, so that it makes the mind turn"
3187,CANTO XVIII.,"to it; and if, thus turned, the mind incline toward it, that"
3188,CANTO XVIII.,"inclination is love, that inclination is nature which is bound anew in"
3189,CANTO XVIII.,"you by pleasure.[1] Then, as the fire moveth upward by its own form,[2]"
3190,CANTO XVIII.,"which is born to ascend thither where it lasts longest in its material,"
3191,CANTO XVIII.,"so the captive mind enters into longing, which is a spiritual motion,"
3192,CANTO XVIII.,and never rests until the thing beloved makes it rejoice. Now it may be
3193,CANTO XVIII.,"apparent to thee, how far the truth is hidden from the people who aver"
3194,CANTO XVIII.,that every love is in itself a laudable thing; because perchance its
3195,CANTO XVIII.,matter appears always to be good;[3] but not every seal is good
3196,CANTO XVIII.,although the wax be good.”
3197,CANTO XVIII.,
3198,CANTO XVIII.,"[1] In his discourse in the preceding canto, Virgil has declared that"
3199,CANTO XVIII.,"neither the Creator nor his creatures are ever without love, either"
3200,CANTO XVIII.,"native in the soul, or proceeding from the mind. Here he explains how"
3201,CANTO XVIII.,the mind is disposed to love by inclination to an image within itself
3202,CANTO XVIII.,of some object which gives it pleasure. This inclination is natural to
3203,CANTO XVIII.,"it; or in his phrase, nature is bound anew in man by the pleasure which"
3204,CANTO XVIII.,arouses the love. All this is a doctrine derived directly from St.
3205,CANTO XVIII.,Thomas Aquinas. “It is the property of every nature to have some
3206,CANTO XVIII.,"inclination, which is a natural appetite, or love.”—Summa Theol., 1,"
3207,CANTO XVIII.,lxxvi. i.
3208,CANTO XVIII.,
3209,CANTO XVIII.,
3210,CANTO XVIII.,[2] Form is here used in its scholastic meaning. “ The active power of
3211,CANTO XVIII.,"anything depends on its form, which is the principle of its action. Fur"
3212,CANTO XVIII.,"the form is either the nature itself of the thing, as in those which"
3213,CANTO XVIII.,"are pure form; or it is a constituent of the nature of the thing, as in"
3214,CANTO XVIII.,"those which are composed of matter and form.”—Summa Theol., 3, xiii. i."
3215,CANTO XVIII.,"Fire by its form, or nature, seeks the sphere of fire between the ether"
3216,CANTO XVIII.,and the moon.

3222,CANTO XVIII.,
3223,CANTO XVIII.,"“Thy words, and my understanding which follows,” replied I to him,"
3224,CANTO XVIII.,“have revealed love to me; but that has made me more full of doubt. For
3225,CANTO XVIII.,"if love is offered to us from without, and if with other foot the soul"
3226,CANTO XVIII.,"go not, if strait or crooked she go is not her own merit.”[1] And he to"
3227,CANTO XVIII.,"me, “So much as reason seeth here can I tell thee; beyond that await"
3228,CANTO XVIII.,still for Beatrice; for it is a work of faith. Every substantial form
3229,CANTO XVIII.,"that is separate from matter, and is united with it,[2] has a specific"
3230,CANTO XVIII.,"virtue residing in itself which without action is not perceived, nor"
3231,CANTO XVIII.,"shows itself save by its effect, as by green leaves the life in a"
3232,CANTO XVIII.,"plant. Yet, whence the intelligence of the first cognitions comes man"
3233,CANTO XVIII.,"doth not know, nor whence the affection for the first objects of"
3234,CANTO XVIII.,"desire, which exist in you even as zeal in the bee for making honey:"
3235,CANTO XVIII.,and this first will admits not desert of praise or blame. Now in order
3236,CANTO XVIII.,"that to this every other may be gathered,[3] the virtue that counsels"
3237,CANTO XVIII.,"[4] is innate in you, and ought to keep the threshold of assent. This"
3238,CANTO XVIII.,"is the principle wherefrom is derived the reason of desert in you,"
3239,CANTO XVIII.,according as it gathers in and winnows good and evil loves. Those who
3240,CANTO XVIII.,"in reasoning went to the foundation took note of this innate liberty,"
3241,CANTO XVIII.,wherefore they bequeathed morals[5] to the world. Assuming then that
3242,CANTO XVIII.,"every love which is kindled within you arises of necessity, the power"
3243,CANTO XVIII.,exists in you to restrain it. This noble virtue Beatrice calls the free
3244,CANTO XVIII.,"will, and therefore see that thou have it in mind, if she take to"
3245,CANTO XVIII.,speaking of it with thee.”
3246,CANTO XVIII.,
3247,CANTO XVIII.,"[1] If love be aroused in the soul by an external object, and if it be"
3248,CANTO XVIII.,"natural to the soul to love, how does she deserve praise or blame for"
3249,CANTO XVIII.,loving?
3250,CANTO XVIII.,

3271,CANTO XVIII.,when the man of Rome sees it between Sardinia and Corsica at its
3272,CANTO XVIII.,"setting;[4] and that gentle shade, for whom Pietola[5] is more famed"

3276,CANTO XVIII.,"drowsiness was taken from me suddenly by folk, who, behind our backs,"
3277,CANTO XVIII.,"had now come round to us. And such as was the rage and throng, which of"
3278,CANTO XVIII.,"old Ismenus and Asopus saw at night along their banks, in case the"
3279,CANTO XVIII.,"Thebans were in need of Bacchus, so, according to what I saw of them as"
3280,CANTO XVIII.,"they came, those who by good will and right love are ridden curve their"
3281,CANTO XVIII.,"steps along that circle. Soon they were upon us; because, running, all"
3282,CANTO XVIII.,"that great crowd was moving on; and two in front, weeping, were crying"
3283,CANTO XVIII.,"out, “Mary ran with haste unto the mountain [7] and Caesar, to subdue"
3284,CANTO XVIII.,"Ilerda, thrust at Marseilles, and then ran on to Spain.”[8] “Swift,"
3285,CANTO XVIII.,"swift, that time be not lost by little love,” cried the others"
3286,CANTO XVIII.,"following, “for zeal in doing well may refreshen grace.” “O people, in"
3287,CANTO XVIII.,"whom keen fervor now perhaps redeems your negligence and delay, through"
3288,CANTO XVIII.,"lukewarmness, in well-doing, this one who is alive (and surely I lie"
3289,CANTO XVIII.,"not to you) wishes to go up, soon as the sun may shine again for us;"
3290,CANTO XVIII.,therefore tell us where is the opening near.” These words were of my
3291,CANTO XVIII.,"Guide; and one of those spirits said: “Come thou behind us, and thou"

3371,CANTO XIX.,"in dream[3] a woman stammering, with eyes asquint, and crooked on her"
3372,CANTO XIX.,"feet, with hands lopped off, and pallid in her color. I gazed at her;"
3373,CANTO XIX.,"and as the sun comforts the cold limbs which the night bennmbs, so my"
3374,CANTO XIX.,"look made her tongue nimble, and then set her wholly straight in little"

3376,CANTO XIX.,"her speech thus unloosed, she began to sing, so that with difficulty"

3460,CANTO XIX.,"whereon he granted me, with cheerful sign, that which the look of my"

3475,CANTO XIX.,mount higher in that life; wherefore the love of this was kindled in

3833,CANTO XXI.,"up here it never trembles because of wind that is hidden, I know not"
3834,CANTO XXI.,"how, in the earth. It trembles here when some soul feels itself pure,"
3835,CANTO XXI.,so that it rises or moves to ascend; and such a cry seconds it. Of the
3836,CANTO XXI.,"purity the will alone makes proof, which surprises the soul, wholly"

3869,CANTO XXI.,"thirst is great, I could not say how much he did me good. And the sage"
3870,CANTO XXI.,"Leader, “Now I see the net which snares you here, and how it is"
3871,CANTO XXI.,unmeshed; wherefore it trembles here; and for what ye rejoice together.
3872,CANTO XXI.,"Now who thou wast may it please thee that I know, and that from thy"
3873,CANTO XXI.,words I learn why for so many centuries thou hast lain here?” “At the
3874,CANTO XXI.,"time when the good Titus, with the aid of the Most High King, avenged"
3875,CANTO XXI.,"the wounds wherefrom issued the blood sold by Judas, I was fatuous"
3876,CANTO XXI.,"enough on earth with the name which lasts longest, and honors most,”[1]"
3877,CANTO XXI.,"replied that spirit, “but not as yet with faith. So sweet was my vocal"
3878,CANTO XXI.,"spirit, that me of Toulouse Rome drew to itself, where I deserved to"
3879,CANTO XXI.,adorn my temples with myrtle. Statius the people still on earth name
3880,CANTO XXI.,"me. I sang of Thebes, and then of the great Achilles, but I fell on the"
3881,CANTO XXI.,way with my second load.[2] Seed of my ardor were the sparks that
3882,CANTO XXI.,warmed me of the divine flame whereby more than a thousand have been
3883,CANTO XXI.,"kindled; I speak of the Aeneid, which was mother to me, and was my"
3884,CANTO XXI.,nurse in poesy: without it I balanced not the weight of a drachm; and
3885,CANTO XXI.,"to have lived yonder, when Virgil lived, I would agree to one sun more"
3886,CANTO XXI.,than I owe for my issue from ban.”[3]

3895,CANTO XXI.,
3896,CANTO XXI.,
3897,CANTO XXI.,"These words turned Virgil to me with a look which, silent, said, “Be"
3898,CANTO XXI.,silent:” but the power that wills cannot do everything; for smiles and
3899,CANTO XXI.,"tears are such followers on the emotion from which each springs, that"
3900,CANTO XXI.,"in the most truthful they least follow the will. I merely smiled, like"
3901,CANTO XXI.,"a man who makes a sign; whereat the shade became silent, and looked at"
3902,CANTO XXI.,"me in the eyes where the expression is most fixed. And it said, “So"
3903,CANTO XXI.,"mayst thou in good complete so great a labor, why aid thy face just now"
3904,CANTO XXI.,display to me a flash of a smile?” Now am I caught on one side and the
3905,CANTO XXI.,"other: one bids me be silent, the other conjures me to speak; wherefore"
3906,CANTO XXI.,"I sigh and am understood by my Master, and “Have no fear to speak,” he"
3907,CANTO XXI.,"said to me, “but speak, and tell him what he asks so earnestly.”"
3908,CANTO XXI.,"Whereon I, “Perhaps thou marvellest, ancient spirit, at the smile I"
3909,CANTO XXI.,gave; but I would have more wonder seize thee. This one who guides my
3910,CANTO XXI.,eyes on high is that Virgil from whom thou didst derive the strength to
3911,CANTO XXI.,sing of men and of the gods. If thou didst believe other cause for my
3912,CANTO XXI.,"smile, dismiss it as untrue, and believe it to be those words which"
3913,CANTO XXI.,thou saidst of him.” Already he was stooping to embrace the feet of my
3914,CANTO XXI.,"Leader, but he said to him, “Brother, do it not, for thou art a shade,"
3915,CANTO XXI.,"and thou seest a shade.” And he rising, “Now canst thou comprehend the"
3916,CANTO XXI.,"sum of the love that warms me to thee when I forget our vanity,"
3917,CANTO XXI.,treating the shades as if a solid thing.”[1]
3918,CANTO XXI.,
3919,CANTO XXI.,[1] Sordello and Virgil (Canto VI.) embraced each other. The shades
3920,CANTO XXI.,could thus express their mutual affection. Perhaps it is out of modesty
3921,CANTO XXI.,"that Virgil here represses Statius, and possibly there may be the under"
3922,CANTO XXI.,"meaning that an act of reverence is not becoming from a soul redeemed,"
3923,CANTO XXI.,to one banned in eternal exile.

3937,CANTO XXII.,"said to us that those who have their desire set on justice are Beati,"
3938,CANTO XXII.,"and his words ended with sitiunt, without the rest.[2] And I, more"
3939,CANTO XXII.,"light than through the other passes, was going on so that without any"
3940,CANTO XXII.,"labor I was following upward the swift spirits, when Virgil began,"
3941,CANTO XXII.,"“Love kindled by virtue always kindles another, provided that its flame"
3942,CANTO XXII.,appear outwardly; wherefore from the hour when amid us Juvenal
3943,CANTO XXII.,"descended into the limbo of Hell, and made known to me thy affection,"
3944,CANTO XXII.,my own good will toward thee was such that more never bound one to an
3945,CANTO XXII.,unseen person; so that these stairs will now seem short to me. But tell
3946,CANTO XXII.,"me (and as a friend pardon me, if too great confidence let loose my"
3947,CANTO XXII.,"rein, and as a friend now talk with me) boxy avarice could find a place"
3948,CANTO XXII.,"within thy breast, amid wisdom so great as that wherewith through thy"

3956,CANTO XXII.,this thirst with the thirst for riches.
3957,CANTO XXII.,
3958,CANTO XXII.,
3959,CANTO XXII.,"These words first moved Statius a little to smiling; then he replied,"
3960,CANTO XXII.,“Every word of thine is a dear sign to me of love. Truly oftentimes
3961,CANTO XXII.,things have such appearance that they give false material for
3962,CANTO XXII.,"suspicion, because the true reasons lie hid. Thy question assures me of"
3963,CANTO XXII.,"thy belief, perhaps because of that circle where I was, that I was"
3964,CANTO XXII.,avaricious in the other life; know then that avarice was too far
3965,CANTO XXII.,"removed from me, and this want of measure thousands of courses of the"
3966,CANTO XXII.,"moon have punished. And had it not been that I set right my care, when"
3967,CANTO XXII.,"I understood the passage where thou dost exclaim, as if indignant with"
3968,CANTO XXII.,"human nature, “O cursed hunger of gold, to what dost thou not impel the"
3969,CANTO XXII.,"appetite of mortals?”[1] I, rolling, should share the dismal jousts.[2]"
3970,CANTO XXII.,Then I perceived that the bands could spread their wings too much in
3971,CANTO XXII.,spending; and I repented as well of that as of my other sins. How many
3972,CANTO XXII.,"shall rise with cropped hair[3] through ignorance, which during life"
3973,CANTO XXII.,"and in the last hours prevents repentance for this sin! And know, that"
3974,CANTO XXII.,"the vice which rebuts any sin with direct opposition,[4] together with"
3975,CANTO XXII.,it here dries up its verdure. Wherefore if to purify myself I have been
3976,CANTO XXII.,"among the people who lament their avarice, because of its contrary this"
3977,CANTO XXII.,has befallen me.” “Now when thou wast singing[5]the cruel strife of the
3978,CANTO XXII.,"twofold affliction[6] of Jocasta,” said the Singer of the Bucolic"
3979,CANTO XXII.,"songs, “it does not appear from that which Clio touches[7] with thee"
3980,CANTO XXII.,"there,[8] that the faith, without which good works suffice not, had yet"
3981,CANTO XXII.,"made thee faithful. If this be so, what sun, or what candles dispersed"
3982,CANTO XXII.,thy darkness so that thou didst thereafter set thy sails behind the
3983,CANTO XXII.,"Fisherman?”[9] And he to him, “Thou first directedst me toward"
3984,CANTO XXII.,"Parnassus to drink in its grots, and then, on the way to God, thou"
3985,CANTO XXII.,"enlightenedst me. Thou didst like him, who goes by night, and carries"
3986,CANTO XXII.,"the light behind him, and helps not himself, but makes the persons"
3987,CANTO XXII.,"following him wise, when thou saidst, ‘The ages are renewed; Justice"
3988,CANTO XXII.,"returns, and the primeval time of man, and a new progeny descends from"
3989,CANTO XXII.,"heaven.’[10] Through thee I became a poet, through thee a Christian."
3990,CANTO XXII.,"But in order that thou mayst better see that which I sketch, I will"
3991,CANTO XXII.,stretch out my hand to color it. Already was the whole world teeming
3992,CANTO XXII.,"with the true belief, sown by the messengers of the eternal realm; and"
3993,CANTO XXII.,these words of thine touched upon just now were in harmony with the new
3994,CANTO XXII.,"preachers, wherefore I adopted the practice of visiting them. They came"
3995,CANTO XXII.,"to me then appearing so holy, that, when Domitian persecuted them, not"
3996,CANTO XXII.,without my tears were their lamentings. And so long as I remained on
3997,CANTO XXII.,earth I succored them; and their upright customs made me scorn all
3998,CANTO XXII.,other sects. And before I had led the Greeks to the rivers of Thebes in
3999,CANTO XXII.,"my verse, I received baptism; but out of fear I was a secret Christian,"
4000,CANTO XXII.,for a long while making show of paganism: and this lukewarmness made me
4001,CANTO XXII.,"circle round the fourth circle,[11] longer than to the fourth century."
4002,CANTO XXII.,"Thou, therefore, that didst lift for me the covering that was hiding"
4003,CANTO XXII.,"from me such great good as I say, while we have remainder of ascent,"
4004,CANTO XXII.,"tell me where is our ancient Terence, Caecilius, Plautus, and Varro, if"
4005,CANTO XXII.,"thou knowest it; tell me if they are damned, and in what region?”"
4006,CANTO XXII.,"“They, and Persius, and I, and many others,” replied my Leader, “are"
4007,CANTO XXII.,"with that Greek whom the Muses suckled more than any other ever, in the"
4008,CANTO XXII.,first girdle of the blind prison. Oftentimes we discourse of the
4009,CANTO XXII.,mountain[12] that hath our nurses[13] always with itself. Euripides is
4010,CANTO XXII.,"there with us, and Antiphon, Simonides, Agathon, and many other Greeks"

4097,XXVI.,"road, with apples sweet and pleasant to the smell. And as a fir-tree"
4098,XXVI.,"tapers upward from branch to branch, so downwardly did that, I think in"
4099,XXVI.,"order that no one may go up. On the side on which our way was closed, a"
4100,XXVI.,clear water fell from the high rock and spread itself over the heaves
4101,XXVI.,"above. The two poets approached the tree, and a voice from within the"

4187,CANTO XXIII.,you; make me not speak while I am marvelling; for ill can he speak who
4188,CANTO XXIII.,"is full of another wish.” And he to me, “From the eternal council falls"
4189,CANTO XXIII.,"a power into the water and into the plant, now left behind, whereby I"
4190,CANTO XXIII.,"become so thin. All this folk who sing weeping, because of following"
4191,CANTO XXIII.,"their appetite beyond measure, here in hunger and in thirst make"
4192,CANTO XXIII.,themselves holy again. The odour which issues from the apple and from
4193,CANTO XXIII.,the spray that spreads over the verdure kindles in us desire to eat and

4201,CANTO XXIII.,"thou come up hither?[3] I thought to find thee still down there below,"
4202,CANTO XXIII.,"where time is made good by time.” And he to me, “My Nella with her"
4203,CANTO XXIII.,bursting tears has brought me thus quickly to drink of the sweet
4204,CANTO XXIII.,wormwood of these torments. With her devout prayers and with sighs has
4205,CANTO XXIII.,"she drawn me from the shore where one waits, and has delivered me from"
4206,CANTO XXIII.,the other circles. So much the more dear and more beloved of God is my
4207,CANTO XXIII.,"little widow, whom I loved so much, as she is the more solitary in good"
4208,CANTO XXIII.,works; for the Barbagia[4] of Sardinia is far more modest in its women
4209,CANTO XXIII.,"than the Barbagia where I left her. O sweet brother, what wouldst thou"
4210,CANTO XXIII.,"that I say? A future time is already in my sight, to which this hour"
4211,CANTO XXIII.,"will not be very old, in which from the pulpit it shall be forbidden to"

4215,CANTO XXIII.,the shameless ones were aware of that which the swift heaven is

4217,CANTO XXIII.,"howling. For if foresight here deceives me not, they will be sad ere he"

4220,CANTO XXIII.,only I but all these people are gazing there where thou dost veil the
4221,CANTO XXIII.,sun.” Whereon I to him: “If thou bring back to mind what thou wast with
4222,CANTO XXIII.,"me, and what I was with thee, the present remembrance will even now be"
4223,CANTO XXIII.,"grievous. From that life he who goes before me turned me the other day,"
4224,CANTO XXIII.,"when the sister of him yonder,” and I pointed to the sun, “showed"
4225,CANTO XXIII.,"herself round. Through the deep night, from the truly dead, he has led"
4226,CANTO XXIII.,"me, with this true flesh which follows him. Thence his counsels have"
4227,CANTO XXIII.,"drawn me up, ascending and circling the mountain that sets you straight"
4228,CANTO XXIII.,whom the world made crooked. So long he says that he will bear me
4229,CANTO XXIII.,company till I shall be there where Beatrice will be; there it behoves
4230,CANTO XXIII.,"that I remain without him. Virgil is he who says thus to me,” and I"
4231,CANTO XXIII.,"pointed to him, “and this other is that shade for whom just now your"
4232,CANTO XXIII.,"realm, which from itself releases him, shook every slope.”"

4263,CANTO XXIV.,"shades, that seemed things doubly dead, through the pits of their eyes"
4264,CANTO XXIV.,"drew in wonder at me, perceiving that I was alive."
4265,CANTO XXIV.,
4266,CANTO XXIV.,"And I, continuing my discourse, said, “He[1] goeth up perchance for"
4267,CANTO XXIV.,"another’s sake more slowly than he would do. But, tell me, if thou"
4268,CANTO XXIV.,"knowest, where is Piccarda[2] tell me if I see person of note among"

4270,CANTO XXIV.,"was I know not which the most, triumphs rejoicing in her crown already"
4271,CANTO XXIV.,"on high Olympus.” So he said first, and then, “Here it is not forbidden"
4272,CANTO XXIV.,"to name each other, since our semblance is so milked away by the"
4273,CANTO XXIV.,"diet.[3] This,” and he pointed with his finger, “is Bonagiunta,[4]"
4274,CANTO XXIV.,"Bonagiunta of Lucca; and that face beyond him, more sharpened than the"
4275,CANTO XXIV.,"others, had the Holy Church in his arms:[5]from Tours he was; and by"
4276,CANTO XXIV.,"fasting he purges the eels of Bolsena, and the Vernaccia wine.” Many"
4277,CANTO XXIV.,"others he named to me, one by one, and at their naming all appeared"
4278,CANTO XXIV.,content; so that for this I saw not one dark mien. For hunger using
4279,CANTO XXIV.,"their teeth on emptiness, I saw Ubaldin dalla Pila, and Boniface,[6]"
4280,CANTO XXIV.,"who shepherded many people with his crook. I saw Messer Marchese, who"
4281,CANTO XXIV.,"once had leisure to drink at Forum with less thirst, and even so was"
4282,CANTO XXIV.,"such that he felt not sated. But as one does who looks, and then makes"
4283,CANTO XXIV.,"account more of one than of another, did I of him of Lucca, who seemed"
4284,CANTO XXIV.,"to have most cognizance of me. He was murmuring; and I know not what,"
4285,CANTO XXIV.,save that I heard “Gentucca” there[7] where he felt the chastisement of
4286,CANTO XXIV.,"the justice which so strips them. “O soul,” said I, “who seemest so"
4287,CANTO XXIV.,"desirous to speak with me, do so that I may hear thee, and satisfy both"
4288,CANTO XXIV.,"thyself and me by thy speech.” “A woman is born, and wears not yet the"
4289,CANTO XXIV.,"veil,”[8] he began, “who will make my city pleasant to thee, however"
4290,CANTO XXIV.,men may blame it.[9] Thou shalt go on with this prevision: if from my
4291,CANTO XXIV.,"murmuring thou hast received error, the true things will yet clear it"
4292,CANTO XXIV.,"up for thee. But say, if I here see him, who drew forth the new rhymes,"
4293,CANTO XXIV.,"beginning, ‘Ladies who have intelligence of Love’?”[10] And I to him,"
4294,CANTO XXIV.,"“I am one, who, when Love inspires me, notes, and in that measure which"
4295,CANTO XXIV.,"he dictates within, I go revealing.” “O brother, now I see,” said he,"

4297,CANTO XXIV.,short of the sweet new style that I hear. I see clearly how your pens

4379,CANTO XXIV.,those two who were such great marshals of the world.[1] And when he had

4484,CANTO XXV.,"forbear, but he said, Discharge the bow of speech which up to the iron"
4485,CANTO XXV.,"thou hast drawn.” Then I opened my mouth confidently, and began, “How"
4486,CANTO XXV.,"can one become thin, where the need of nourishment is not felt?” “If"
4487,CANTO XXV.,thou hadst called to mind how Meleager was consumed by time consuming
4488,CANTO XXV.,"of a brand this would not be,” he said, “ so difficult to thee; and if"
4489,CANTO XXV.,"thou hadst thought, how at your quivering your image quivers within the"
4490,CANTO XXV.,"mirror, that which seems hard would seem easy to thee. But that thou"
4491,CANTO XXV.,"mayst to thy pleasure be inwardly at ease, lo, here is Statius, and I"
4492,CANTO XXV.,call on him and pray that he be now the healer of thy wounds.” “If I
4493,CANTO XXV.,"explain to him the eternal view,” replied Statius, “where thou art"
4494,CANTO XXV.,"present, let it excuse me that to thee I cannot snake denial.”[1]"
4495,CANTO XXV.,
4496,CANTO XXV.,[1] Here and elsewhere Statius seems to represent allegorically human

4500,CANTO XXV.,
4501,CANTO XXV.,"Then he began, “If, son, thy mind regards and receives my words, they"
4502,CANTO XXV.,"will be. for thee a light unto the ‘how,’ which thou askest.[1] The"
4503,CANTO XXV.,"perfect blood which is never drunk by the thirsty veins, but remains"
4504,CANTO XXV.,"like the food which thou removest from time table, takes in time heart"
4505,CANTO XXV.,"virtue informative of all the human members; even as that blood does,"
4506,CANTO XXV.,which passes through the veins to become those members.[2] Digested yet
4507,CANTO XXV.,"again, it descends to the part whereof it is more becoming to be silent"
4508,CANTO XXV.,"than to speak; and thence, afterwards, it drops upon another’s blood in"
4509,CANTO XXV.,the natural vessel. There one and the other meet together; the one
4510,CANTO XXV.,"ordained to be passive, and the other to be active because of the"
4511,CANTO XXV.,"perfect place[3] wherefrom it is pressed out; and, conjoined with the"
4512,CANTO XXV.,"former, the latter begins to operate, first by coagulating, and then by"
4513,CANTO XXV.,quickening that to which it gives consistency for its own material. The
4514,CANTO XXV.,"active virtue having become a soul, like that of a plant (in so far"
4515,CANTO XXV.,"different that this is on the way, and that already arrived),[4] so"
4516,CANTO XXV.,"worketh then, that now it moves and feels, as a sea-fungus doth; and"
4517,CANTO XXV.,"then it proceeds to organize the powers of which it is the germ. Now,"
4518,CANTO XXV.,"son, the virtue is displayed, now it is diffused, which issues from the"
4519,CANTO XXV.,"heart of the begetter, where nature is intent on all the members.[5]"
4520,CANTO XXV.,"But how from an animal it becomes a speaking being,[6] thou as yet"
4521,CANTO XXV.,seest not; this is such a point that once it made one wiser than thee
4522,CANTO XXV.,"to err, so that in his teaching he separated from the soul the"
4523,CANTO XXV.,"potential intellect, because he saw no organ assumed by it.[7] Open thy"
4524,CANTO XXV.,"heart unto the truth that is coming, and know that, so soon as in the"
4525,CANTO XXV.,"foitus the articulation of the brain is perfect, the Primal Motor turns"
4526,CANTO XXV.,"to it with joy over such art of nature, and inspires a new spirit"
4527,CANTO XXV.,"replete with virtue, which draws that which it finds active there into"
4528,CANTO XXV.,"its own substance, and makes one single soul which lives and feels and"
4529,CANTO XXV.,circles on itself. And that thou mayst the less wonder at this
4530,CANTO XXV.,"doctrine, consider the warmth of the sun which, combining with the"
4531,CANTO XXV.,"juice that flows from the vine, becomes wine. And when Lachesis has no"
4532,CANTO XXV.,"more thread, this soul is loosed from the flesh, and virtually bears"
4533,CANTO XXV.,away with itself both the human and the divine; the other faculties all
4534,CANTO XXV.,"of them mute,[8] but memory, understanding, and will[9] far more acute"
4535,CANTO XXV.,"in action than before. Without staying, it falls of itself, marvelously"
4536,CANTO XXV.,to one of the banks.[10] Here it first knows its own roads. Soon as the
4537,CANTO XXV.,"place there circumscribes it, the formative virtue rays out around it"
4538,CANTO XXV.,"in like manner, and as much as in the living members.[11] And as the"
4539,CANTO XXV.,air when it is full of rain becomes adorned with divers colors by
4540,CANTO XXV.,"another’s rays which are reflected in it, so here the neighboring air"
4541,CANTO XXV.,shapes itself in that form which is virtually imprinted upon it by the
4542,CANTO XXV.,soul that hath stopped.[12] And then like the flamelet which follows
4543,CANTO XXV.,"the fire wherever it shifts, so its new form follows the spirit. Since"
4544,CANTO XXV.,"thereafter from this it has its aspect, it is called a shade; and by"
4545,CANTO XXV.,this it shapes the organ for every sense even to the sight; by this we
4546,CANTO XXV.,"speak, and by this we laugh, by this we make the tears and the sighs,"
4547,CANTO XXV.,which on the mountain thou mayst have perceived. According as the
4548,CANTO XXV.,desires and the other affections impress us the shade is shaped; and
4549,CANTO XXV.,this is the cause of that at which thou wonderest.”
4550,CANTO XXV.,
4551,CANTO XXV.,[1] The doctrine set forth by Statius in the following discourse is

4603,CANTO XXV.,sequesters a path from it.[2] Wherefore it was needful to go one by one
4604,CANTO XXV.,along the unenclosed side; and on the one hand I was afraid of the
4605,CANTO XXV.,"fire, and on the other I was afraid of falling off. My Leader said,"

4608,CANTO XXV.,"in the bosom of the great burning then I heard singing, which made me"
4609,CANTO XXV.,care not less to turn. And I saw spirits going through the flame;
4610,CANTO XXV.,"wherefore I looked at them and at my own steps, apportioning to each my"
4611,CANTO XXV.,"sight from moment to moment. After the end of that hymn, they loudly"
4612,CANTO XXV.,cried: “Virum non cognosco;”[4] then began again the hymn with low
4613,CANTO XXV.,"voice; this finished, they cried anew, “To the wood Diana kept herself,"
4614,CANTO XXV.,"and drove therefrom Helice,[5] who had felt the poison of Venus.” Then"
4615,CANTO XXV.,"they turned to singing; then wives they cried out, and husbands who"
4616,CANTO XXV.,"were chaste, as virtue and marriage enjoin upon us. And I believe this"
4617,CANTO XXV.,mode suffices them through all the time the fire burns them. With such
4618,CANTO XXV.,"cure it is needful, and with such food, that the last wound of all"

4732,CANTO XXVI.,"thought I went on, gazing a long time upon him; nor, for the fire, did"

4734,CANTO XXVI.,"wholly ready for his service, with the affirmation that makes another"
4735,CANTO XXVI.,"believe. And he to me, “By what I hear thou leavest such trace in me,"

4900,CANTO XXVII.,"through so many branches the care of mortals goes seeking, to-day shall"
4901,CANTO XXVII.,put in peace thy hungerings.” Virgil used words such as these toward
4902,CANTO XXVII.,"me, and never were there gifts which could be equal in pleasure to"
4903,CANTO XXVII.,"these. Such wish upon wish came to me to be above, that at every step"
4904,CANTO XXVII.,thereafter I felt the feathers growing for my flight.
4905,CANTO XXVII.,
4906,CANTO XXVII.,[1] As they come nearer home.
4907,CANTO XXVII.,
4908,CANTO XXVII.,
4909,CANTO XXVII.,"When beneath us all the stairway had been run, and we were on the"
4910,CANTO XXVII.,"topmost step, Virgil fixed his eyes on me, and said, “The temporal fire"
4911,CANTO XXVII.,"and the eternal thou hast seen, son, and art come to a place where of"
4912,CANTO XXVII.,myself no further onward I discern. I have brought thee here with
4913,CANTO XXVII.,understanding and with art; thine own pleasure now take thou for guide:
4914,CANTO XXVII.,"forth art thou from the steep ways, forth art thou from the narrow. See"
4915,CANTO XXVII.,"there the sun, which on thy front doth shine; see the young grass, the"
4916,CANTO XXVII.,"flowers, the shrubs, which here the earth of itself alone produces."
4917,CANTO XXVII.,Until rejoicing come the beautiful eyes which weeping made me come to
4918,CANTO XXVII.,"thee, thou canst sit down and thou canst go among them. Expect no more"
4919,CANTO XXVII.,"or word or sign from me. Free, upright, and sane is thine own free"
4920,CANTO XXVII.,"will, and it would be wrong not to act according to its pleasure;"
4921,CANTO XXVII.,wherefore thee over thyself I crown and mitre.”

4932,CANTO XXVIII.,
4933,CANTO XXVIII.,
4934,CANTO XXVIII.,Fain now to search within and round about the divine forest dense and
4935,CANTO XXVIII.,"living, which tempered the new day to my eyes, without longer waiting I"
4936,CANTO XXVIII.,"left the bank, taking the level ground very slowly, over the soil that"
4937,CANTO XXVIII.,everywhere breathes fragrance. A sweet breeze that had no variation in
4938,CANTO XXVIII.,"itself struck me on the brow, not with heavier blow than a soft wind;"
4939,CANTO XXVIII.,"at which the branches, readily trembling, all of them were bending to"
4940,CANTO XXVIII.,the quarter where the holy mountain casts its first shadow; yet not so
4941,CANTO XXVIII.,"far parted from their straightness, that the little birds among the"
4942,CANTO XXVIII.,tops would leave the practice of their every art; but with full joy
4943,CANTO XXVIII.,"singing they received the early breezes among the leaves, which kept a"
4944,CANTO XXVIII.,"burden to their rhymes, such as gathers from bough to bough through the"
4945,CANTO XXVIII.,"pine forest upon the shore of Chiassi, when Aeolus lets forth"
4946,CANTO XXVIII.,Sirocco.[1]
4947,CANTO XXVIII.,

4949,CANTO XXVIII.,
4950,CANTO XXVIII.,
4951,CANTO XXVIII.,Now had my show steps carried me within the ancient wood so far that I
4952,CANTO XXVIII.,"could not see back to where I had entered it: and lo, a stream took"
4953,CANTO XXVIII.,"from me further progress, which toward the left with its little waves"
4954,CANTO XXVIII.,"was bending the grass that sprang upon its bank. All the waters, that"
4955,CANTO XXVIII.,"are purest on the earth, would seem to have some mixture in them,"
4956,CANTO XXVIII.,"compared with that which hides nothing, although it moves along dusky"
4957,CANTO XXVIII.,"under the perpetual shadow, which never lets the sun or moon shine"
4958,CANTO XXVIII.,there.
4959,CANTO XXVIII.,
4960,CANTO XXVIII.,"With feet I stayed, and with my eyes I passed to the other side of the"
4961,CANTO XXVIII.,"streamlet, to gaze at the great variety of the fresh may; and there"
4962,CANTO XXVIII.,"appeared to me, even as a thing appears suddenly which turns aside"
4963,CANTO XXVIII.,"through wonder every other thought, a solitary lady, who was going"
4964,CANTO XXVIII.,"along, singing, and culling flower from flower, wherewith all her path"
4965,CANTO XXVIII.,"was painted. “Ah, fair Lady,[1] who warmest thyself in the rays of"
4966,CANTO XXVIII.,"love, if I may trust to looks which are wont to be witnesses of the"
4967,CANTO XXVIII.,"heart, may the will come to thee,” said I to her, “to draw forward"
4968,CANTO XXVIII.,"toward this stream, so far that I can understand what thou art singing."
4969,CANTO XXVIII.,"Thou makest me remember where and what was Proserpine, at the time when"
4970,CANTO XXVIII.,"her mother lost her, and she the spring.”"
4971,CANTO XXVIII.,
4972,CANTO XXVIII.,"[1] This lady is the type of the life of virtuous activity. Her name,"
4973,CANTO XXVIII.,"as appears later, is Matilda. Why this name was chosen for her, and"
4974,CANTO XXVIII.,"whether she stands for any earthly personage, has been the subject of"
4975,CANTO XXVIII.,vast and still open debate.
4976,CANTO XXVIII.,
4977,CANTO XXVIII.,
4978,CANTO XXVIII.,As a lady who is dancing turns with feet close to the ground and to
4979,CANTO XXVIII.,"each other, and hardly sets foot before foot, she turned herself on the"
4980,CANTO XXVIII.,"red and on the yellow flowerets toward me, not otherwise than a virgin"
4981,CANTO XXVIII.,"who lowers her modest eyes, and made my prayers content, approaching so"
4982,CANTO XXVIII.,that the sweet sound came to me with its meaning. Soon as she was there
4983,CANTO XXVIII.,"where the grasses are now bathed by the waves of the fair stream, she"
4984,CANTO XXVIII.,bestowed on me the gift of lifting her eyes. I do not believe that so
4985,CANTO XXVIII.,"great a light shone beneath the lids of Venus, transfixed by her son,"
4986,CANTO XXVIII.,"beyond all his custom. She was smiling upon the opposite right bank,"
4987,CANTO XXVIII.,gathering with her hands more colors which that high land brings forth
4988,CANTO XXVIII.,without seed. The stream made us three paces apart; but the Hellespont
4989,CANTO XXVIII.,where Xerxes passed it—a curb still on all human pride—endured not more
4990,CANTO XXVIII.,"hatred from Leander for swelling between Sestos and Abydos, than that"
4991,CANTO XXVIII.,"from me because it opened not then. “Ye are new come,” she began, “and,"
4992,CANTO XXVIII.,"perchance, why I smile mu this place chosen for human nature as its"
4993,CANTO XXVIII.,"nest, some doubt holds you marvelling; but the psalm ‘Delectasti’[1]"
4994,CANTO XXVIII.,affords light which may uncloud your understanding.And thou who art in
4995,CANTO XXVIII.,"front, and didst pray to me, say, if else thou wouldst hear, for I came"
4996,CANTO XXVIII.,"ready for every question of thine, so far as may suffice.” “The water,”"
4997,CANTO XXVIII.,"said I, “and the sound of the forest, impugn within me recent faith in"
4998,CANTO XXVIII.,"something that I heard contrary to this.” Whereon she, “I will tell,"
4999,CANTO XXVIII.,how from its own cause proceeds that which makes thee wonder; and I
5000,CANTO XXVIII.,will clear away the mist which strikes thee.
5001,CANTO XXVIII.,
5002,CANTO XXVIII.,"[1] Psalm xcii. 4. “Delectasti me, Domine, in factura tua, et in"
5003,CANTO XXVIII.,"operibus mannuum tuarum exultabo.” “For thou, Lord, hast made me glad"
5004,CANTO XXVIII.,through thy work; I will triumph in the works of thy hands.”
5005,CANTO XXVIII.,
5006,CANTO XXVIII.,
5007,CANTO XXVIII.,"“The supreme Good, which itself alone is pleasing to itself, made man"
5008,CANTO XXVIII.,"good, and for good, and gave this place for earnest to him of eternal"
5009,CANTO XXVIII.,peace. Through his own default he dwelt here little while; through his
5010,CANTO XXVIII.,own default to tears and to toil he changed honest laughter and sweet
5011,CANTO XXVIII.,"play. In order that the disturbance, which the exhalations of the water"
5012,CANTO XXVIII.,and of the earth (which follow so far as they can the heat) produce
5013,CANTO XXVIII.,"below, might not make any war on man, this mountain rose so high toward"
5014,CANTO XXVIII.,"heaven, and is free from them from the point where it is locked in.[1]"
5015,CANTO XXVIII.,Now because the whole air revolves in circuit with the primal
5016,CANTO XXVIII.,"revolution,[2] if its circle be not broken by some projection, upon"
5017,CANTO XXVIII.,"this height, which is wholly disengaged in the living air, this motion"
5018,CANTO XXVIII.,"strikes, and makes the wood, since it is dense, resound; and the plant"
5019,CANTO XXVIII.,being struck hath such power that with its virtue it impregnates the
5020,CANTO XXVIII.,"breeze, and this then in its whirling scatters it around: and the rest"
5021,CANTO XXVIII.,"of the earth, according as it is fit in itself, or through its sky,"
5022,CANTO XXVIII.,conceives and brings forth divers trees of divers virtues. It should
5023,CANTO XXVIII.,"not seem a marvel then on earth, this being heard, when some plant,"
5024,CANTO XXVIII.,"without manifest seed, there takes hold. And thou must know that the"
5025,CANTO XXVIII.,"holy plain where thou art is full of every seed, and has fruit in it"
5026,CANTO XXVIII.,which yonder is not gathered. The water which thou seest rises not from
5027,CANTO XXVIII.,"a vein restored by vapor which the frost condenses, like a stream that"
5028,CANTO XXVIII.,"gains and loses breath, but it issues from a fountain constant and"
5029,CANTO XXVIII.,"sure, which by the will of God regains as much as, open on two sides,"
5030,CANTO XXVIII.,it pours forth. On this side it descends with virtue that takes from
5031,CANTO XXVIII.,one the memory of sin; on the other it restores that of every good
5032,CANTO XXVIII.,"deed. Here Lethe, so on the other side Eunoe it is called; and it works"
5033,CANTO XXVIII.,not if first it be not tasted on this side and on that. To all other
5034,CANTO XXVIII.,savors this is superior.
5035,CANTO XXVIII.,
5036,CANTO XXVIII.,"[1] Above the level of the gate through which Purgatory is entered, as"
5037,CANTO XXVIII.,"Statius has already explained (Canto XXI), the vapors of earth do not"
5038,CANTO XXVIII.,rise.

5044,CANTO XXVIII.,"“And, though thy thirst may be fully sated even if I disclose no more"
5045,CANTO XXVIII.,"to thee, I will yet give thee a corollary for grace; nor do I think my"
5046,CANTO XXVIII.,"speech  may be less dear to thee, if beyond promise it enlarge itself"
5047,CANTO XXVIII.,"with thee. Those who in ancient time told in poesy of the Age of Gold,"
5048,CANTO XXVIII.,"and of its happy state, perchance upon Parnassus dreamed of this place:"
5049,CANTO XXVIII.,"here was the root of mankind innocent; here is always spring, and every"
5050,CANTO XXVIII.,fruit; this is the nectar of which each tells.”
5051,CANTO XXVIII.,
5052,CANTO XXVIII.,"I turned me back then wholly to my Poets, and saw that with a smile"
5053,CANTO XXVIII.,they had heard the last sentence; then to the beautiful Lady I turned

5067,CANTO XXIX.,"were wont to go solitary through the sylvan shades, this one desiring"
5068,CANTO XXIX.,"to see and that to avoid the sun, she moved on then counter to the"
5069,CANTO XXIX.,"stream, going up along the bank, and I at even pace with her, following"
5070,CANTO XXIX.,"her little step with little. Of her steps and mine were not a hundred,"
5071,CANTO XXIX.,"when the banks both like gave a turn, in such wise that toward the east"
5072,CANTO XXIX.,"I faced again. Nor thus had our way been long, when the lady wholly"
5073,CANTO XXIX.,"turned round to me, saying, “My brother, look and listen.” And lo! a"
5074,CANTO XXIX.,"sudden lustre ran from all quarters through the great forest, so that"
5075,CANTO XXIX.,it put me in suspect of lightning. But because the lightning ceases
5076,CANTO XXIX.,"even as it comes, and this, hasting, became more and more resplendent,"
5077,CANTO XXIX.,"in my thought I said, “What thing is this?” And a sweet melody ran"
5078,CANTO XXIX.,through the luminous air; whereupon a righteous zeal caused me to blame
5079,CANTO XXIX.,"the temerity of Eve, that, there, where time earth and the heavens were"
5080,CANTO XXIX.,"obedient, the woman only, and but just now formed, did not endure to"
5081,CANTO XXIX.,stay under any veil; under which if she had devoutly stayed I should
5082,CANTO XXIX.,"have tasted those ineffable delights before, and for a longer time."
5083,CANTO XXIX.,"While I was going on and such first fruits of the eternal pleasure, all"
5084,CANTO XXIX.,"enrapt, and still desirous of more joys, in front of us the air under"
5085,CANTO XXIX.,"the green branches became like a blazing fire, and the sweet sound was"
5086,CANTO XXIX.,now heard as a song.

5094,CANTO XXIX.,"behoves that Helicon pour forth for me, and Urania aid me with her"
5095,CANTO XXIX.,choir to put in verse things difficult to think.
5096,CANTO XXIX.,
5097,CANTO XXIX.,"A little further on, the long tract of space which was still between us"
5098,CANTO XXIX.,and them presented falsely what seemed seven trees of gold. But when I
5099,CANTO XXIX.,"had come so near to them that the common object, which deceives the"
5100,CANTO XXIX.,"sense,[1] lost not through distance any of its attributes, the power"
5101,CANTO XXIX.,which supplies discourse to reason distinguished them as
5102,CANTO XXIX.,"candlesticks,[2] and in the voices of the song, “Hosanna.” From above"
5103,CANTO XXIX.,"the fair array was flaming, brighter by far than the Moon in the serene"
5104,CANTO XXIX.,"of midnight, in the middle of her month. I turned me round full of"
5105,CANTO XXIX.,"wonder to the good Virgil, and he replied to me with a look charged not"
5106,CANTO XXIX.,less with amazement. Then I turned back my face to the high things that
5107,CANTO XXIX.,were moving toward us so slowly they would have been outstripped by
5108,CANTO XXIX.,"new-made brides. The lady cried to me, “Why burnest thou only thus with"
5109,CANTO XXIX.,"affection for the living lights, and lookest not at that which comes"
5110,CANTO XXIX.,"behind them?” Then saw I folk coming behind, as if after their leaders,"
5111,CANTO XXIX.,"clothed in white, and such purity there never was on earth. The water"
5112,CANTO XXIX.,"was resplendent on the left flank, and reflected to me my left side, if"
5113,CANTO XXIX.,"I looked in it, even as a mirror. When on my bank I had such position"
5114,CANTO XXIX.,"that only the stream separated me, in order to see better, I gave halt"
5115,CANTO XXIX.,to my steps. And I saw the flamelets go forward heaving the air behind
5116,CANTO XXIX.,"them painted, and they had the semblance of streaming pennons, so that"
5117,CANTO XXIX.,there above it remained divided by seven stripes all in those colors
5118,CANTO XXIX.,"whereof the sun makes his bow, and Delia her girdle.[3] These banners"
5119,CANTO XXIX.,"to the rear were longer than my sight, and according to my judgment the"
5120,CANTO XXIX.,"outermost were ten paces apart. Under so fair a sky as I describe,"
5121,CANTO XXIX.,"twenty-four elders,[4] two by two, were coming crowned with"
5122,CANTO XXIX.,"flower-de-luce. All were singing, “Blessed thou among the daughters of"
5123,CANTO XXIX.,"Adam, and blessed forever be thy beauties.”"
5124,CANTO XXIX.,
5125,CANTO XXIX.,"[1] An object which has properties common to many things, so that at a"
5126,CANTO XXIX.,distance the sight cannot distinguish its specific nature.
5127,CANTO XXIX.,
5128,CANTO XXIX.,
5129,CANTO XXIX.,[2] The imagery of the Triumph of the Church here described is largely
5130,CANTO XXIX.,taken from this Apocalypse. “And I turned to see the voice that spake
5131,CANTO XXIX.,"with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden"
5132,CANTO XXIX.,"candlesticks.”—Revelation, i. 12. “And there were seven lamps of fire"
5133,CANTO XXIX.,"burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.”—Id.,"
5134,CANTO XXIX.,"iv. 5. “And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of"
5135,CANTO XXIX.,"wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit"
5136,CANTO XXIX.,of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord.”—Isiah xi. 2.
5137,CANTO XXIX.,
5138,CANTO XXIX.,
5139,CANTO XXIX.,"[3] Delia, the moon, and her girdle the halo."
5140,CANTO XXIX.,
5141,CANTO XXIX.,
5142,CANTO XXIX.,[4] “And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon
5143,CANTO XXIX.,"the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white"
5144,CANTO XXIX.,"raiment.”—Revelation, iv. 4. These four and twenty elders in white"
5145,CANTO XXIX.,"raiment, and crowned with white lilies, white being the color of faith,"
5146,CANTO XXIX.,symbolize the books of the Old Testament.
5147,CANTO XXIX.,
5148,CANTO XXIX.,
5149,CANTO XXIX.,"After the flowers, and the other fresh herbage opposite to me on the"
5150,CANTO XXIX.,"other bank, were free from those folk elect, even as light followeth"
5151,CANTO XXIX.,"light in heaven, came behind them four living creatures, crowned each"
5152,CANTO XXIX.,"one with green leaves. Every one was feathered with six wings, the"
5153,CANTO XXIX.,feathers full of eyes; and the eyes of Argus were they living would be
5154,CANTO XXIX.,"such. To describe their forms I scatter rhymes no more, Reader; for"
5155,CANTO XXIX.,other spending constrains me so that in this I cannot be liberal. But
5156,CANTO XXIX.,"read Ezekiel, who depicts them as he saw them coming from the cold"
5157,CANTO XXIX.,"region with wind, with cloud, and with fire; and such as thou wilt find"
5158,CANTO XXIX.,"them in his pages such were they here, save that as to the wings John"
5159,CANTO XXIX.,"is with me, and differs from him.[1]"
5160,CANTO XXIX.,
5161,CANTO XXIX.,[1] These four living creatures symbolize the Gospels. Ezekiel (i.6)
5162,CANTO XXIX.,"describes the creatures with four wings, but in the Revelation (iv. 8)"
5163,CANTO XXIX.,John assigns to each of them six wings: “and they were full of eyes
5164,CANTO XXIX.,"within.” They are crowned with green, as the color of hope."
5165,CANTO XXIX.,
5166,CANTO XXIX.,
5167,CANTO XXIX.,The space between these four contained a triumphal chariot upon two
5168,CANTO XXIX.,"wheels, which by the neck of a griffon[1] came drawn along. And he"
5169,CANTO XXIX.,"stretched up one and the other of his wings between the midmost stripe,"
5170,CANTO XXIX.,"and the three and three, so that he did harm to no one of them by"
5171,CANTO XXIX.,cleaving it. So far they rose that they were not seen. His members were
5172,CANTO XXIX.,"of gold so far as he was bird, and the rest were white mixed with red."
5173,CANTO XXIX.,"Not Africanus, or indeed Augustus, gladdened Rome with so beautiful a"
5174,CANTO XXIX.,"chariot; but even that of the Sun would be poor to it,—that of the Sun"
5175,CANTO XXIX.,"which, going astray,[2] was consumed at the prayer of the devout Earth,"
5176,CANTO XXIX.,"when Jove in his secrecy was just. Three ladies,[3] at the right wheel,"
5177,CANTO XXIX.,came dancing in a circle; one so ruddy that hardly would she have been
5178,CANTO XXIX.,noted in the fire; the next was as if her flesh and bones had been made
5179,CANTO XXIX.,of emerald; the third seemed snow just fallen. And now they seemed led
5180,CANTO XXIX.,"by the white, now by the red, and from her song the others took their"
5181,CANTO XXIX.,step both slow and swift. On the left four[4] robed in purple made
5182,CANTO XXIX.,"festival, following the measure of one of them who had three eyes in"
5183,CANTO XXIX.,her head.
5184,CANTO XXIX.,
5185,CANTO XXIX.,"[1] The griffon, half eagle and half lion, represents Christ in his"
5186,CANTO XXIX.,"double nature, divine and human. The car which he draws is the Church."

5199,CANTO XXIX.,
5200,CANTO XXIX.,
5201,CANTO XXIX.,"Next after all the group described, I saw two old men, unlike in dress,"
5202,CANTO XXIX.,"but like in action, both dignified and staid. The one showed himself"
5203,CANTO XXIX.,one of the familiars of that supreme Hippocrates whom Nature made for
5204,CANTO XXIX.,the creatures that she holds most dear[1] the other showed the contrary
5205,CANTO XXIX.,"care,[2] with a shining and sharp sword, such that it caused me fear on"
5206,CANTO XXIX.,"the hither side of the stream. Then I saw four humble in appearance,"
5207,CANTO XXIX.,and behind all an old man solitary coming asleep with lively
5208,CANTO XXIX.,countenance.[3] And these seven were robed like the first band; but
5209,CANTO XXIX.,"they made not a thicket of lilies round their heads, rather of roses,"
5210,CANTO XXIX.,and of other red flowers. The sight at little distance would have sworn
5211,CANTO XXIX.,that all were aflame above their brows. And when the chariot was
5212,CANTO XXIX.,"opposite to me thunder was heard, and those worthy people seemed to"
5213,CANTO XXIX.,"have further progress interdicted, stopping there with the first"
5214,CANTO XXIX.,ensigns.

5327,CANTO XXX.,"the left border of the chariot,—when I turned me at the sound of my own"
5328,CANTO XXX.,"name, which of necessity is registered here,—I saw the Lady, who had"
5329,CANTO XXX.,"first appeared to me veiled beneath the angelic festival, directing her"
5330,CANTO XXX.,"eyes toward me across the stream although the veil, which descended"
5331,CANTO XXX.,"from her head, circled by the leaf of Minerva, did not allow her to"
5332,CANTO XXX.,"appear distinctly. Royally, still haughty in her mien, she went on, as"
5333,CANTO XXX.,"one who speaks, and keeps back his warmest speech: “Look at me well: I"
5334,CANTO XXX.,"am, indeed, I am, indeed, Beatrice. How hast thou deigned to approach"
5335,CANTO XXX.,the mountain? Didst thou know that man is happy here?” My eyes fell
5336,CANTO XXX.,down into the clear fount; but seeing myself in it I drew them to the
5337,CANTO XXX.,"grass, such great shame burdened my brow. As to the son the mother"
5338,CANTO XXX.,"seems proud, so she seemed to me; for somewhat bitter tasteth the savor"
5339,CANTO XXX.,"of stern pity. She was silent, and the angels sang of a sudden, “In te,"
5340,CANTO XXX.,"Domine, speravi;” but beyond “pedes meos”[1] they did not pass. Even as"
5341,CANTO XXX.,"the snow, among the living rafters upon the back of Italy, is"

5345,CANTO XXX.,before the song of those who time their notes after the notes of the
5346,CANTO XXX.,eternal circles. But when I heard in their sweet accords their
5347,CANTO XXX.,"compassion for me, more than if they had said, “Lady, why dost thou so"
5348,CANTO XXX.,confound him?” the ice that was bound tight around my heart became

5372,CANTO XXX.,"that he who is weeping yonder may understand me, so that fault and"
5373,CANTO XXX.,grief may be of one measure. Not only through the working of the great
5374,CANTO XXX.,"wheels,[2] which direct every seed to some end according as the stars"
5375,CANTO XXX.,"are its companions, but through largess of divine graces, which have"
5376,CANTO XXX.,for their rain vapors so lofty that our sight goes not near
5377,CANTO XXX.,"thereto,—this man was such in his new life, virtually, that every right"
5378,CANTO XXX.,habit would have made admirable proof in him. But so much the more
5379,CANTO XXX.,"malign and more savage becomes the land ill-sown and untilled, as it"
5380,CANTO XXX.,has more of good terrestrial vigor. Some time did I sustain him with my
5381,CANTO XXX.,face; showing my youthful eyes to him I led him with me turned in right
5382,CANTO XXX.,"direction. So soon as I was upon the threshold of my second age, and"
5383,CANTO XXX.,"had changed life, this one took himself from me, and gave himself to"
5384,CANTO XXX.,"others. When from flesh to spirit I had ascended, and beauty and virtue"
5385,CANTO XXX.,"were increased in me, I was less dear and less pleasing to him; and he"
5386,CANTO XXX.,"turned his steps along a way not true, following false images of good,"
5387,CANTO XXX.,which pay no promise in full. Nor did it avail me to obtain[3]
5388,CANTO XXX.,"inspirations with which, both in dream and otherwise, I called him"
5389,CANTO XXX.,back; so little did he heed them. So low he fell that all means for his
5390,CANTO XXX.,"salvation were already short, save showing him the lost people. For"
5391,CANTO XXX.,"this I visited the gate of the dead, and to him, who has conducted him"
5392,CANTO XXX.,"up hither, my prayers were borne with weeping. The high decree of God"
5393,CANTO XXX.,"would be broken, if Lethe should be passed, and such viands should be"

5420,CANTO XXXI.,extinct before it could be released by its organs. A little she bore
5421,CANTO XXXI.,"it; then she said, “What thinkest thou? Reply to me; for the sad"

5434,CANTO XXXI.,"there is nothing whereto man may aspire, what trenches running"
5435,CANTO XXXI.,"traverse, or what chains didst thou find, for which thou wert obliged"

5439,CANTO XXXI.,"hardly had I the voice that answered, and the lips with difficulty gave"
5440,CANTO XXXI.,"it form. Weeping, I said, “The present things with their false pleasure"
5441,CANTO XXXI.,"turned my steps, soon as your face was hidden.” And she: “Hadst thou"
5442,CANTO XXXI.,"been silent, or hadst thou denied that which thou dost confess, thy"
5443,CANTO XXXI.,"fault would be not less noted, by such a Judge is it known. But when"

5448,CANTO XXXI.,listen; so shalt thou hear how in opposite direction my buried flesh
5449,CANTO XXXI.,ought to have moved thee. Never did nature or art present to thee
5450,CANTO XXXI.,pleasure such as the fair limbs wherein I was enclosed; and they are

5453,CANTO XXXI.,"its desire? Forsooth thou oughtest, at the first arrow of things"

5455,CANTO XXXI.,"should thy wings have weighed thee downward to await more blows, either"

5501,CANTO XXXI.,"She had drawn me into the stream up to the throat, and dragging me"

5594,CANTO XXXII.,
5595,CANTO XXXII.,[2] “Thou lookest too fixedly; thou hast yet other duties than
5596,CANTO XXXII.,contemplation.”
5597,CANTO XXXII.,
5598,CANTO XXXII.,
5599,CANTO XXXII.,As under its shields to save itself a troop turns and wheels with its
5600,CANTO XXXII.,"banner, before it all can change about, that soldiery of the celestial"
5601,CANTO XXXII.,realm which was in advance had wholly gone past us before its front
5602,CANTO XXXII.,beam[1] had bent the chariot round. Then to the wheels the ladies
5603,CANTO XXXII.,"returned, and the griffon moved his blessed burden, in such wise"
5604,CANTO XXXII.,however that no feather of him shook. The beautiful lady who had drawn
5605,CANTO XXXII.,"me at the ford, and Statius and I were following the wheel which made"
5606,CANTO XXXII.,"its orbit with the smaller arc. So walking through the lofty wood,"
5607,CANTO XXXII.,"empty through fault of her who trusted to the serpent, an angelic song"
5608,CANTO XXXII.,set the time to our steps. Perhaps an arrow loosed from the bow had in
5609,CANTO XXXII.,"three flights reached such a distance as we had advanced, when Beatrice"
5610,CANTO XXXII.,descended. I heard “Adam!” murmured by all:[2] then they circled a
5611,CANTO XXXII.,plant despoiled of flowers and of other leafage on every bough.[3] Its
5612,CANTO XXXII.,"branches, which so much the wider spread the higher up they are,[4]"
5613,CANTO XXXII.,would be wondered at for height by the Indians in their woods.
5614,CANTO XXXII.,
5615,CANTO XXXII.,[1] Its pole.
5616,CANTO XXXII.,
5617,CANTO XXXII.,
5618,CANTO XXXII.,[2] In reproach of him who had in disobedience tasted of the fruit of
5619,CANTO XXXII.,this tree.
5620,CANTO XXXII.,
5621,CANTO XXXII.,
5622,CANTO XXXII.,[3] After the sin of Adam the plant was despoiled of virtue till the
5623,CANTO XXXII.,coming of Christ.
5624,CANTO XXXII.,
5625,CANTO XXXII.,
5626,CANTO XXXII.,[4] The branches of the tree of knowledge spread widest as they are
5627,CANTO XXXII.,nearest to the Divine Source of truth.
5628,CANTO XXXII.,
5629,CANTO XXXII.,
5630,CANTO XXXII.,"“Blessed art thou, Griffon, that thou dost not break off with thy beak"
5631,CANTO XXXII.,"of this wood sweet to the taste, since the belly is ill racked"
5632,CANTO XXXII.,thereby.”[1] Thus around the sturdy tree the others cried; and the
5633,CANTO XXXII.,animal of two natures: “So is preserved the seed of all
5634,CANTO XXXII.,"righteousness.”[2] And turning to the pole that he had drawn, he"
5635,CANTO XXXII.,"dragged it to the foot of the widowed trunk, and that which was of"
5636,CANTO XXXII.,it[3] he left bound to it.
5637,CANTO XXXII.,
5638,CANTO XXXII.,"[1] “For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the"
5639,CANTO XXXII.,"obedience of one shall many be made righteous.”—Romans, v. 19."
5640,CANTO XXXII.,
5641,CANTO XXXII.,
5642,CANTO XXXII.,"[2] “That as sin had reigned unto deaths, even so might grace reign"
5643,CANTO XXXII.,"through righteousness unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ, our"
5644,CANTO XXXII.,"Lord.”—Id., v. 21."
5645,CANTO XXXII.,
5646,CANTO XXXII.,
5647,CANTO XXXII.,"[3] This pole, the mystic type of the cross of Christ, supposed to have"
5648,CANTO XXXII.,been made of the wood of this tree.
5649,CANTO XXXII.,
5650,CANTO XXXII.,
5651,CANTO XXXII.,"As our plants, when the great light falls downward mingled with that"
5652,CANTO XXXII.,"which shines behind the celestial Carp,[1] become swollen, and then"
5653,CANTO XXXII.,"renew themselves, each in its own color, ere the sun yoke his coursers"
5654,CANTO XXXII.,"under another star, so disclosing a color less than of roses and more"
5655,CANTO XXXII.,"than of violets, the plant renewed itself, which first had its boughs"
5656,CANTO XXXII.,"so bare.[2] I did not understand the hymn, and it is not sung here,[3]"
5657,CANTO XXXII.,"which that folk then sang, nor did I hear the melody to the end."
5658,CANTO XXXII.,
5659,CANTO XXXII.,"[1] In this spring, when the Sun is in Aries, the sign which follows"
5660,CANTO XXXII.,that of the Pisces here termed the Carp.
5661,CANTO XXXII.,
5662,CANTO XXXII.,
5663,CANTO XXXII.,"[2] This tree, after the death of Christ, still remains this symbol of"
5664,CANTO XXXII.,"the knowledge of good and of evil, as well as this sign of obedience to"
5665,CANTO XXXII.,the Divine Will. Its renewal with flowers and foliage seems to he the
5666,CANTO XXXII.,"image at once of the revelation of Divine truth through Christ, and of"
5667,CANTO XXXII.,his obedience unto death.
5668,CANTO XXXII.,
5669,CANTO XXXII.,
5670,CANTO XXXII.,[3] On earth.
5671,CANTO XXXII.,
5672,CANTO XXXII.,
5673,CANTO XXXII.,"If I could portray how the pitiless eyes[1] sank to slumber, while"
5674,CANTO XXXII.,"hearing of Syrinx, the eyes to which too much watching cost so dear,"
5675,CANTO XXXII.,hike a painter who paints from a model I would depict how I fell
5676,CANTO XXXII.,"asleep; but whoso would, let him be one who can picture slumber"
5677,CANTO XXXII.,"well.[2] Therefore I pass on to when I awoke, and say that a splendor"
5678,CANTO XXXII.,"rent for me the veil of sleep, and a call, “Arise, what doest thou?”"
5679,CANTO XXXII.,
5680,CANTO XXXII.,"[1] The hundred eyes of Argus, who, when watching Io, fell asleep while"
5681,CANTO XXXII.,"listening to the tale of the loves of Pan and Syrinx, and was then"
5682,CANTO XXXII.,slain by Mercury.
5683,CANTO XXXII.,
5684,CANTO XXXII.,
5685,CANTO XXXII.,[2] The sleep of Dante may signify the impotency of human reason to
5686,CANTO XXXII.,explain the mysteries of redemption.
5687,CANTO XXXII.,
5688,CANTO XXXII.,
5689,CANTO XXXII.,"As, to see some of the flowerets of the apple-tree[1] which makes the"
5690,CANTO XXXII.,"Angels greedy of its fruit,[2] and makes perpetual bridal feasts in"
5691,CANTO XXXII.,"Heaven,[3] Peter and John and James were led,[4] and being overcome,"
5692,CANTO XXXII.,came to themselves at the word by which greater slumbers[5] were
5693,CANTO XXXII.,"broken, and saw their band diminished alike by Moses and Elias, and the"
5694,CANTO XXXII.,"raiment of their Master changed, so I came to myself, and saw that"
5695,CANTO XXXII.,"compassionate one standing above me, who first had been conductress of"
5696,CANTO XXXII.,"my steps along the stream; and all in doubt I said, “Where is"
5697,CANTO XXXII.,"Beatrice?” And she, “Behold her under the new leafage sitting upon its"
5698,CANTO XXXII.,root. Behold the company that surrounds her; the rest are going on high
5699,CANTO XXXII.,"behind the griffon, with sweeter song and more profound.”[6] And if her"
5700,CANTO XXXII.,"speech was more diffuse I know not, because already in my eyes was she"
5701,CANTO XXXII.,who from attending to aught else had closed me in. Alone she was
5702,CANTO XXXII.,"sitting upon the bare ground, like a guard left there of the chariot"
5703,CANTO XXXII.,which I had seen bound by the biform animal. In a circle the seven
5704,CANTO XXXII.,"Nymphs were making of themselves an enclosure for her, with those"
5705,CANTO XXXII.,lights in their hands that are secure from Aquilo and from Auster.[7]
5706,CANTO XXXII.,
5707,CANTO XXXII.,"[1] “As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved"
5708,CANTO XXXII.,"among the suns.”—The Song of Solomon, ii. 3."
5709,CANTO XXXII.,
5710,CANTO XXXII.,
5711,CANTO XXXII.,[2] The full glory of Christ in Heaven.
5712,CANTO XXXII.,
5713,CANTO XXXII.,
5714,CANTO XXXII.,"[3] The marriage supper of the Lamb—Revelation, xix. 9."
5715,CANTO XXXII.,

5717,CANTO XXXII.,"[4] The transfiguration—Matthew, xvii. 1-8."
5718,CANTO XXXII.,
5719,CANTO XXXII.,
5720,CANTO XXXII.,[5] Those of the dead called back to life by Jesus.
5721,CANTO XXXII.,
5722,CANTO XXXII.,
5723,CANTO XXXII.,"[6] Christ having ascended, Beatrice, this type of Theology, is left by"
5724,CANTO XXXII.,"the chariot, the type of the Church on earth."
5725,CANTO XXXII.,
5726,CANTO XXXII.,
5727,CANTO XXXII.,"[7] From the north wind or the south; that is, from any earthly blast."
5728,CANTO XXXII.,
5729,CANTO XXXII.,
5730,CANTO XXXII.,“Here shalt thou be short time a forester; and thou shalt be with me
5731,CANTO XXXII.,without end a citizen of that Rome whereof Christ is a Roman. Therefore
5732,CANTO XXXII.,"for profit of the world that lives ill, keep now thine eyes upon the"
5733,CANTO XXXII.,"chariot; amid what thou seest, having returned to earth, mind that thou"
5734,CANTO XXXII.,"write.” Thus Beatrice; and I, who at the feet of her commands was all"
5735,CANTO XXXII.,"devout, gave my mind and my eyes where she willed."
5736,CANTO XXXII.,
5737,CANTO XXXII.,"Never with so swift a motion did fire descend from a dense cloud, when"
5738,CANTO XXXII.,"it is raining from that region which stretches most remote, as I saw"
5739,CANTO XXXII.,"the bird of Jove stoop downward through the tree, breaking the bark, as"
5740,CANTO XXXII.,well as the flowers and new leaves; and he struck the chariot with all
5741,CANTO XXXII.,"his force, whereat it reeled, like a ship in a tempest beaten by the"
5742,CANTO XXXII.,"waves now to starboard, now to larboard.[1] Then I saw leap into the"
5743,CANTO XXXII.,"body of the triumphal vehicle a she fox,[2] which seemed fasting from"
5744,CANTO XXXII.,all good food; but rebuking her for her foul sins my Lady turned her to
5745,CANTO XXXII.,"such flight as her fleshless bones allowed. Then, from there whence he"
5746,CANTO XXXII.,"had first come, I saw the eagle descend down into the ark of the"
5747,CANTO XXXII.,chariot and leave it feathered from himself.[3] And a voice such as
5748,CANTO XXXII.,"issues from a heart that is afflicted issued from Heaven, and thus"
5749,CANTO XXXII.,"spake, “O little bark of mine, how ill art thou laden!” Then it seemed"
5750,CANTO XXXII.,"to me that the earth opened between the two wheels, and I saw a dragon"
5751,CANTO XXXII.,"issue from it, which through the chariot upward fixed his tail: and,"
5752,CANTO XXXII.,"like a wasp that retracts its sting, drawing to himself his malign"
5753,CANTO XXXII.,"tail, drew out part of the bottom, and went wandering away.[4] That"
5754,CANTO XXXII.,"which remained covered itself again, as lively soil with grass, with"
5755,CANTO XXXII.,"the plumage, offered perhaps with sane and benign intention; and both"
5756,CANTO XXXII.,one and the other wheel and the pole were again covered with it in such
5757,CANTO XXXII.,"time that a sigh holds the mouth open longer.[5] Thus transformed, the"
5758,CANTO XXXII.,"holy structure put forth heads upon its parts, three upon the pole, and"
5759,CANTO XXXII.,"one on each corner. The first were horned like oxen, but the four had a"
5760,CANTO XXXII.,single horn upon the forehead.[6] A like prodigy was never seen before.
5761,CANTO XXXII.,"Secure, as fortress on a high mountain, there appeared to me a loose"
5762,CANTO XXXII.,"harlot sitting upon it, with eyes roving around. And, as if in order"
5763,CANTO XXXII.,"that she should not be taken from him, I saw standing at her side a"
5764,CANTO XXXII.,"giant, and some while they kissed each other. But because she turned"
5765,CANTO XXXII.,her lustful and wandering eye on me that fierce paramour scourged her
5766,CANTO XXXII.,"from head to foot. Then full of jealousy, and cruel with anger, he"
5767,CANTO XXXII.,"loosed the monster, and drew it through the wood so far that only of"
5768,CANTO XXXII.,that he made a shield from me for the harlot and for the strange
5769,CANTO XXXII.,beast.[7]
5770,CANTO XXXII.,
5771,CANTO XXXII.,[1] The descent and the attack of the eagle symbolize the rejection of
5772,CANTO XXXII.,Christianity and the persecution of the Church by the emperors.
5773,CANTO XXXII.,
5774,CANTO XXXII.,
5775,CANTO XXXII.,[2] The fox denotes the early heresies.
5776,CANTO XXXII.,
5777,CANTO XXXII.,
5778,CANTO XXXII.,[3] The feathering of the car is the type of the donation of
5779,CANTO XXXII.,"Constantine,—the temporal endowment of the Church."
5780,CANTO XXXII.,
5781,CANTO XXXII.,
5782,CANTO XXXII.,[4] The dragging off by the dragon of a part of the car probably
5783,CANTO XXXII.,figures the schism of the Greek Church in the 9th century.
5784,CANTO XXXII.,
5785,CANTO XXXII.,
5786,CANTO XXXII.,[5] This new feathering signifies the fresh and growing endowments of
5787,CANTO XXXII.,the Church.
5788,CANTO XXXII.,
5789,CANTO XXXII.,
5790,CANTO XXXII.,"[6] The seven heads have been interpreted as the seven mortal sins,"
5791,CANTO XXXII.,"which grew up in the transformed church, the result of its wealth and"
5792,CANTO XXXII.,temporal power.
5793,CANTO XXXII.,
5794,CANTO XXXII.,
5795,CANTO XXXII.,[7] The harlot and the giant stand respectively for the Pope (both
5796,CANTO XXXII.,"Boniface VIII. and him successor Clement V.) and the kings of France,"
5797,CANTO XXXII.,especially Philip the Fair. The turning of the eyes of the harlot upon
5798,CANTO XXXII.,"Dante seems to signify the dealings of Boniface with the Italians,"
5799,CANTO XXXII.,"which awakened the jealousy of Philip; and the dragging of the car,"
5800,CANTO XXXII.,"transformed into a monster, through the wood, so far as to hide it from"
5801,CANTO XXXII.,"the poet, may be taken as typifying the removal of the seat of the"
5802,CANTO XXXII.,"Papacy from Rome to Avignon, in 1305."
5803,CANTO XXXII.,
5804,CANTO XXXII.,
5805,CANTO XXXII.,
5806,CANTO XXXII.,
5807,CANTO XXXIII.,CANTO XXXIII.
5808,CANTO XXXIII.,
5809,CANTO XXXIII.,
5810,CANTO XXXIII.,The Earthly Paradise.—Prophecy of Beatrice concerning one who shall
5811,CANTO XXXIII.,restore the Empire.—Her discourse with Dante.—The river Eunoe.—Dante
5812,CANTO XXXIII.,"drinks of it, and is fit to ascend to Heaven."
5813,CANTO XXXIII.,
5814,CANTO XXXIII.,
5815,CANTO XXXIII.,"“Deus, venerunt gentes,”[1] the ladies began, alternating, now three"
5816,CANTO XXXIII.,"now four, a sweet psalmody, and weeping. And Beatrice, sighing and"
5817,CANTO XXXIII.,"compassionate, was listening to them so moved that scarce more changed"
5818,CANTO XXXIII.,was Mary at the cross. But when the other virgins gave place to her to
5819,CANTO XXXIII.,"speak, risen upright upon her feet, she answered, colored like fire:"
5820,CANTO XXXIII.,"“Modicum, et non videbitis me, et iterum, my beloved Sisters, Modicum,"
5821,CANTO XXXIII.,et vos videbitis me.”[2] Then she set all the seven in front of her;
5822,CANTO XXXIII.,"and behind her, by a sign only, she placed me, and the Lady, and the"
5823,CANTO XXXIII.,Sage who had stayed.[3] So she moved on; and I do not think her tenth
5824,CANTO XXXIII.,"step had been set upon the ground, when with her eyes my eyes she"
5825,CANTO XXXIII.,"smote, and with tranquil aspect said to me, “Come more quickly, so that"
5826,CANTO XXXIII.,"if I speak with thee, to listen to me thou mayst be well placed.” So"
5827,CANTO XXXIII.,"soon as I was with her as I should be, she said to me, “Brother, why"
5828,CANTO XXXIII.,"dost thou not venture to ask of me, now thou art coming with me?”"
5829,CANTO XXXIII.,
5830,CANTO XXXIII.,"[1] Thus first words of the seventy-ninth Psalm: “O God, the heathen"
5831,CANTO XXXIII.,are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled;
5832,CANTO XXXIII.,"they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.” The whole Psalm, picturing the"
5833,CANTO XXXIII.,"actual desolation of the Church, but closing with confident prayer to"
5834,CANTO XXXIII.,"the Lord to restore his people, is sung by the holy ladies."
5835,CANTO XXXIII.,
5836,CANTO XXXIII.,
5837,CANTO XXXIII.,"[2] “A little while and ye shall not see me: and again, A little while"
5838,CANTO XXXIII.,"and ye shall see me.”—John, xvi. 16. An answer and promise"
5839,CANTO XXXIII.,corresponding to the complaint and petition of the Psalm.
5840,CANTO XXXIII.,
5841,CANTO XXXIII.,
5842,CANTO XXXIII.,"[3] The lady, Matilda, and the sage, Statius."
5843,CANTO XXXIII.,
5844,CANTO XXXIII.,
5845,CANTO XXXIII.,Even as befalls those who with excess of reverence are speaking in
5846,CANTO XXXIII.,"presence of their superiors, and drag not their voice living to the"
5847,CANTO XXXIII.,"teeth,[1] it befell me that without perfect sound I began, “My Lady,"
5848,CANTO XXXIII.,"you know my need, and that which is good for it.” And site to me, “From"
5849,CANTO XXXIII.,"fear and from shame I wish that thou henceforth divest thyself, so that"
5850,CANTO XXXIII.,"thou speak no more like a man who dreams. Know thou, that the vessel"
5851,CANTO XXXIII.,"which the serpent[2] broke was, and is not;[3] but let him who is to"
5852,CANTO XXXIII.,blame therefor believe that the vengeance of God fears not sops.[4] Not
5853,CANTO XXXIII.,for all time shall be without an heir the eagle that left its feathers
5854,CANTO XXXIII.,"on the car, whereby it became a monster, and then a prey.[5] For I see"
5855,CANTO XXXIII.,"surely, and therefore I tell it, stars already close at hand, secure"
5856,CANTO XXXIII.,"from every obstacle and from every hindrance, to give to us a time in"
5857,CANTO XXXIII.,"which a Five hundred, Ten, and Five sent by God[6] shall slay the"
5858,CANTO XXXIII.,thievish woman[7] and that giant who with her is delinquent. And
5859,CANTO XXXIII.,"perchance my narration, dark as Themis and the Sphinx,[8] less"
5860,CANTO XXXIII.,"persuades thee, because after their fashion it clouds the"
5861,CANTO XXXIII.,understanding. But soon the facts will be the Naiades[9] that shall
5862,CANTO XXXIII.,"solve this difficult enigma, without harm of flocks or of harvest. Do"
5863,CANTO XXXIII.,"thou note; and even as they are borne from me, do thou so report these"
5864,CANTO XXXIII.,words to those alive with that life which is a running unto death; and
5865,CANTO XXXIII.,"have in mind when thou writest them, not to conceal what thou hast seen"
5866,CANTO XXXIII.,"the plant, which now has been twice plundered here. Whoso robs that, or"
5867,CANTO XXXIII.,"breaks it,[10] with blasphemy in act offends God, who only for His own"
5868,CANTO XXXIII.,"use created it holy. For biting that, the first soul, in pain and in"
5869,CANTO XXXIII.,"desire, five thousand years and more, longed for Him who punished on"
5870,CANTO XXXIII.,"Himself the bite. Thy wit sleeps, if it deem not that for a special"
5871,CANTO XXXIII.,reason it is so high and so inverted at its top. And if thy vain
5872,CANTO XXXIII.,"thoughts had not been as water of Elsa[11] round about thy mind, and"
5873,CANTO XXXIII.,"their pleasantness as Pyramus to the mulberry,[12] by so many"
5874,CANTO XXXIII.,circumstances only thou hadst recognized morally the justice of God in
5875,CANTO XXXIII.,the interdict upon the tree. But since I see thee in thy understanding
5876,CANTO XXXIII.,"made of stone, and thus stony, dark, so that the light of my speech"
5877,CANTO XXXIII.,"dazzles thee, I would yet that thou bear it hence within thee,—and if"
5878,CANTO XXXIII.,"not written, at least depicted,—for the reason that the pilgrim’s staff"
5879,CANTO XXXIII.,"is carried wreathed with palm.”[13] And I, “Even as by a seal wax which"
5880,CANTO XXXIII.,"alters not the imprinted figure, is my brain now stamped by you. But"
5881,CANTO XXXIII.,"why does your desired word fly so far above my sight, that the more it"
5882,CANTO XXXIII.,"strives the more it loses it?” “In order that thou mayst know,” she"
5883,CANTO XXXIII.,"said, “that school which thou hast followed, and mayst see how its"
5884,CANTO XXXIII.,doctrine can follow my word [14] and mayst see your path distant so far
5885,CANTO XXXIII.,"from the divine, as the heaven which highest hastens is remote from"
5886,CANTO XXXIII.,"earth.” Whereon I replied to her, “I do not remember that I ever"
5887,CANTO XXXIII.,"estranged myself from you, nor have I conscience of it that may sting"
5888,CANTO XXXIII.,"me.” “And if thou canst not remember it,” smiling she replied, “now"
5889,CANTO XXXIII.,bethink thee how this day thou hast drunk of Lethe. And if from smoke
5890,CANTO XXXIII.,"fire be inferred, such oblivion clearly proves fault in thy will"
5891,CANTO XXXIII.,elsewhere intent.[15] Truly my words shall henceforth be naked so far
5892,CANTO XXXIII.,as it shall be befitting to uncover them to thy rude sight.”
5893,CANTO XXXIII.,

5904,CANTO XXXIII.,"commonly held by the Florentines, if a murderer could contrive within"
5905,CANTO XXXIII.,"nine days of the murder to eat a sop of bread dipped in wine, above the"
5906,CANTO XXXIII.,"grave of his victim, he would escape from the vengeance of the family"
5907,CANTO XXXIII.,of the murdered man.
5908,CANTO XXXIII.,
5909,CANTO XXXIII.,
5910,CANTO XXXIII.,"[5] The meaning is that an Emperor shall come, who shall restore the"
5911,CANTO XXXIII.,"Church from its captivity, and reestablish the Divine order upon earth,"

5913,CANTO XXXIII.,Church and Empire.
5914,CANTO XXXIII.,
5915,CANTO XXXIII.,
