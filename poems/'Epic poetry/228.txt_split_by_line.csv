43,THE ARGUMENT.,
44,THE ARGUMENT.,
45,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojans, after a seven years’ voyage, set sail for Italy, but"
46,THE ARGUMENT.,"are overtaken by a dreadful storm, which Aeolus raises at the"
47,THE ARGUMENT.,"request of Juno. The tempest sinks one, and scatters the rest."
48,THE ARGUMENT.,"Neptune drives off the winds, and calms the sea. Aeneas, with his"
49,THE ARGUMENT.,"own ship and six more, arrives safe at an African port. Venus"
50,THE ARGUMENT.,complains to Jupiter of her son’s misfortunes. Jupiter comforts
51,THE ARGUMENT.,"her, and sends Mercury to procure him a kind reception among the"
52,THE ARGUMENT.,"Carthaginians. Aeneas, going out to discover the country, meets"
53,THE ARGUMENT.,"his mother in the shape of a huntress, who conveys him in a cloud"
54,THE ARGUMENT.,"to Carthage, where he sees his friends whom he thought lost, and"
55,THE ARGUMENT.,"receives a kind entertainment from the queen. Dido, by device of"
56,THE ARGUMENT.,"Venus, begins to have a passion for him, and, after some"
57,THE ARGUMENT.,"discourse with him, desires the history of his adventures since"
58,THE ARGUMENT.,"the siege of Troy, which is the subject of the two following"
59,THE ARGUMENT.,books.
60,THE ARGUMENT.,
61,THE ARGUMENT.,
62,THE ARGUMENT.,"Arms, and the man I sing, who, forc’d by fate,"
63,THE ARGUMENT.,"And haughty Juno’s unrelenting hate,"
64,THE ARGUMENT.,"Expell’d and exil’d, left the Trojan shore."
65,THE ARGUMENT.,"Long labours, both by sea and land, he bore,"
66,THE ARGUMENT.,"And in the doubtful war, before he won"
67,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Latian realm, and built the destin’d town;"
68,THE ARGUMENT.,"His banish’d gods restor’d to rites divine,"
69,THE ARGUMENT.,"And settled sure succession in his line,"
70,THE ARGUMENT.,"From whence the race of Alban fathers come,"
71,THE ARGUMENT.,And the long glories of majestic Rome.
72,THE ARGUMENT.,O Muse! the causes and the crimes relate;
73,THE ARGUMENT.,"What goddess was provok’d, and whence her hate;"
74,THE ARGUMENT.,For what offence the Queen of Heav’n began
75,THE ARGUMENT.,"To persecute so brave, so just a man;"
76,THE ARGUMENT.,"Involv’d his anxious life in endless cares,"
77,THE ARGUMENT.,"Expos’d to wants, and hurried into wars!"
78,THE ARGUMENT.,"Can heav’nly minds such high resentment show,"
79,THE ARGUMENT.,Or exercise their spite in human woe?
80,THE ARGUMENT.,
81,THE ARGUMENT.,"Against the Tiber’s mouth, but far away,"
82,THE ARGUMENT.,An ancient town was seated on the sea;
83,THE ARGUMENT.,A Tyrian colony; the people made
84,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stout for the war, and studious of their trade:"
85,THE ARGUMENT.,Carthage the name; belov’d by Juno more
86,THE ARGUMENT.,"Than her own Argos, or the Samian shore."
87,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here stood her chariot; here, if Heav’n were kind,"
88,THE ARGUMENT.,The seat of awful empire she design’d.
89,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet she had heard an ancient rumour fly,"
90,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Long cited by the people of the sky,)"
91,THE ARGUMENT.,That times to come should see the Trojan race
92,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her Carthage ruin, and her tow’rs deface;"
93,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor thus confin’d, the yoke of sov’reign sway"
94,THE ARGUMENT.,Should on the necks of all the nations lay.
95,THE ARGUMENT.,"She ponder’d this, and fear’d it was in fate;"
96,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor could forget the war she wag’d of late
97,THE ARGUMENT.,For conqu’ring Greece against the Trojan state.
98,THE ARGUMENT.,"Besides, long causes working in her mind,"
99,THE ARGUMENT.,"And secret seeds of envy, lay behind;"
100,THE ARGUMENT.,Deep graven in her heart the doom remain’d
101,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of partial Paris, and her form disdain’d;"
102,THE ARGUMENT.,"The grace bestow’d on ravish’d Ganymed,"
103,THE ARGUMENT.,"Electra’s glories, and her injur’d bed."
104,THE ARGUMENT.,Each was a cause alone; and all combin’d
105,THE ARGUMENT.,To kindle vengeance in her haughty mind.
106,THE ARGUMENT.,"For this, far distant from the Latian coast"
107,THE ARGUMENT.,She drove the remnants of the Trojan host;
108,THE ARGUMENT.,And sev’n long years th’ unhappy wand’ring train
109,THE ARGUMENT.,"Were toss’d by storms, and scatter’d thro’ the main."
110,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such time, such toil, requir’d the Roman name,"
111,THE ARGUMENT.,Such length of labour for so vast a frame.
112,THE ARGUMENT.,
113,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now scarce the Trojan fleet, with sails and oars,"
114,THE ARGUMENT.,"Had left behind the fair Sicilian shores,"
115,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ent’ring with cheerful shouts the wat’ry reign,"
116,THE ARGUMENT.,And plowing frothy furrows in the main;
117,THE ARGUMENT.,"When, lab’ring still with endless discontent,"
118,THE ARGUMENT.,The Queen of Heav’n did thus her fury vent:
119,THE ARGUMENT.,
120,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Then am I vanquish’d? must I yield?” said she,"
121,THE ARGUMENT.,“And must the Trojans reign in Italy?
122,THE ARGUMENT.,"So Fate will have it, and Jove adds his force;"
123,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor can my pow’r divert their happy course.
124,THE ARGUMENT.,"Could angry Pallas, with revengeful spleen,"
125,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Grecian navy burn, and drown the men?"
126,THE ARGUMENT.,"She, for the fault of one offending foe,"
127,THE ARGUMENT.,The bolts of Jove himself presum’d to throw:
128,THE ARGUMENT.,"With whirlwinds from beneath she toss’d the ship,"
129,THE ARGUMENT.,And bare expos’d the bosom of the deep;
130,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, as an eagle gripes the trembling game,"
131,THE ARGUMENT.,"The wretch, yet hissing with her father’s flame,"
132,THE ARGUMENT.,"She strongly seiz’d, and with a burning wound"
133,THE ARGUMENT.,"Transfix’d, and naked, on a rock she bound."
134,THE ARGUMENT.,"But I, who walk in awful state above,"
135,THE ARGUMENT.,"The majesty of heav’n, the sister wife of Jove,"
136,THE ARGUMENT.,For length of years my fruitless force employ
137,THE ARGUMENT.,Against the thin remains of ruin’d Troy!
138,THE ARGUMENT.,"What nations now to Juno’s pow’r will pray,"
139,THE ARGUMENT.,Or off’rings on my slighted altars lay?”
140,THE ARGUMENT.,
141,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus rag’d the goddess; and, with fury fraught."
142,THE ARGUMENT.,"The restless regions of the storms she sought,"
143,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where, in a spacious cave of living stone,"
144,THE ARGUMENT.,"The tyrant Aeolus, from his airy throne,"
145,THE ARGUMENT.,"With pow’r imperial curbs the struggling winds,"
146,THE ARGUMENT.,And sounding tempests in dark prisons binds.
147,THE ARGUMENT.,"This way and that th’ impatient captives tend,"
148,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, pressing for release, the mountains rend."
149,THE ARGUMENT.,"High in his hall th’ undaunted monarch stands,"
150,THE ARGUMENT.,"And shakes his scepter, and their rage commands;"
151,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which did he not, their unresisted sway"
152,THE ARGUMENT.,Would sweep the world before them in their way;
153,THE ARGUMENT.,"Earth, air, and seas thro’ empty space would roll,"
154,THE ARGUMENT.,And heav’n would fly before the driving soul.
155,THE ARGUMENT.,"In fear of this, the Father of the Gods"
156,THE ARGUMENT.,"Confin’d their fury to those dark abodes,"
157,THE ARGUMENT.,"And lock’d ’em safe within, oppress’d with mountain loads;"
158,THE ARGUMENT.,"Impos’d a king, with arbitrary sway,"
159,THE ARGUMENT.,"To loose their fetters, or their force allay."
160,THE ARGUMENT.,"To whom the suppliant queen her pray’rs address’d,"
161,THE ARGUMENT.,And thus the tenor of her suit express’d:
162,THE ARGUMENT.,
163,THE ARGUMENT.,“O Aeolus! for to thee the King of Heav’n
164,THE ARGUMENT.,The pow’r of tempests and of winds has giv’n;
165,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy force alone their fury can restrain,"
166,THE ARGUMENT.,"And smooth the waves, or swell the troubled main."
167,THE ARGUMENT.,"A race of wand’ring slaves, abhorr’d by me,"
168,THE ARGUMENT.,With prosp’rous passage cut the Tuscan sea;
169,THE ARGUMENT.,"To fruitful Italy their course they steer,"
170,THE ARGUMENT.,And for their vanquish’d gods design new temples there.
171,THE ARGUMENT.,Raise all thy winds; with night involve the skies;
172,THE ARGUMENT.,Sink or disperse my fatal enemies.
173,THE ARGUMENT.,"Twice sev’n, the charming daughters of the main,"
174,THE ARGUMENT.,"Around my person wait, and bear my train:"
175,THE ARGUMENT.,"Succeed my wish, and second my design;"
176,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fairest, Deiopeia, shall be thine,"
177,THE ARGUMENT.,And make thee father of a happy line.”
178,THE ARGUMENT.,
179,THE ARGUMENT.,"To this the god: “’Tis yours, O queen, to will"
180,THE ARGUMENT.,The work which duty binds me to fulfil.
181,THE ARGUMENT.,"These airy kingdoms, and this wide command,"
182,THE ARGUMENT.,Are all the presents of your bounteous hand:
183,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yours is my sov’reign’s grace; and, as your guest,"
184,THE ARGUMENT.,I sit with gods at their celestial feast;
185,THE ARGUMENT.,"Raise tempests at your pleasure, or subdue;"
186,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dispose of empire, which I hold from you.”"
187,THE ARGUMENT.,
188,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said, and hurl’d against the mountain side"
189,THE ARGUMENT.,"His quiv’ring spear, and all the god applied."
190,THE ARGUMENT.,"The raging winds rush thro’ the hollow wound,"
191,THE ARGUMENT.,"And dance aloft in air, and skim along the ground;"
192,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, settling on the sea, the surges sweep,"
193,THE ARGUMENT.,"Raise liquid mountains, and disclose the deep."
194,THE ARGUMENT.,"South, East, and West with mix’d confusion roar,"
195,THE ARGUMENT.,And roll the foaming billows to the shore.
196,THE ARGUMENT.,The cables crack; the sailors’ fearful cries
197,THE ARGUMENT.,Ascend; and sable night involves the skies;
198,THE ARGUMENT.,And heav’n itself is ravish’d from their eyes.
199,THE ARGUMENT.,Loud peals of thunder from the poles ensue;
200,THE ARGUMENT.,Then flashing fires the transient light renew;
201,THE ARGUMENT.,"The face of things a frightful image bears,"
202,THE ARGUMENT.,And present death in various forms appears.
203,THE ARGUMENT.,"Struck with unusual fright, the Trojan chief,"
204,THE ARGUMENT.,"With lifted hands and eyes, invokes relief;"
205,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, “Thrice and four times happy those,” he cried,"
206,THE ARGUMENT.,“That under Ilian walls before their parents died!
207,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tydides, bravest of the Grecian train!"
208,THE ARGUMENT.,"Why could not I by that strong arm be slain,"
209,THE ARGUMENT.,"And lie by noble Hector on the plain,"
210,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or great Sarpedon, in those bloody fields"
211,THE ARGUMENT.,Where Simois rolls the bodies and the shields
212,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of heroes, whose dismember’d hands yet bear"
213,THE ARGUMENT.,"The dart aloft, and clench the pointed spear!”"
214,THE ARGUMENT.,
215,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus while the pious prince his fate bewails,"
216,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fierce Boreas drove against his flying sails,"
217,THE ARGUMENT.,"And rent the sheets; the raging billows rise,"
218,THE ARGUMENT.,And mount the tossing vessels to the skies:
219,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor can the shiv’ring oars sustain the blow;
220,THE ARGUMENT.,"The galley gives her side, and turns her prow;"
221,THE ARGUMENT.,"While those astern, descending down the steep,"
222,THE ARGUMENT.,Thro’ gaping waves behold the boiling deep.
223,THE ARGUMENT.,"Three ships were hurried by the southern blast,"
224,THE ARGUMENT.,And on the secret shelves with fury cast.
225,THE ARGUMENT.,Those hidden rocks th’ Ausonian sailors knew:
226,THE ARGUMENT.,"They call’d them Altars, when they rose in view,"
227,THE ARGUMENT.,And show’d their spacious backs above the flood.
228,THE ARGUMENT.,"Three more fierce Eurus, in his angry mood,"
229,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dash’d on the shallows of the moving sand,"
230,THE ARGUMENT.,And in mid ocean left them moor’d a-land.
231,THE ARGUMENT.,"Orontes’ bark, that bore the Lycian crew,"
232,THE ARGUMENT.,"(A horrid sight!) ev’n in the hero’s view,"
233,THE ARGUMENT.,From stem to stern by waves was overborne:
234,THE ARGUMENT.,"The trembling pilot, from his rudder torn,"
235,THE ARGUMENT.,"Was headlong hurl’d; thrice round the ship was toss’d,"
236,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then bulg’d at once, and in the deep was lost;"
237,THE ARGUMENT.,And here and there above the waves were seen
238,THE ARGUMENT.,"Arms, pictures, precious goods, and floating men."
239,THE ARGUMENT.,"The stoutest vessel to the storm gave way,"
240,THE ARGUMENT.,And suck’d thro’ loosen’d planks the rushing sea.
241,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ilioneus was her chief: Alethes old,"
242,THE ARGUMENT.,"Achates faithful, Abas young and bold,"
243,THE ARGUMENT.,"Endur’d not less; their ships, with gaping seams,"
244,THE ARGUMENT.,Admit the deluge of the briny streams.
245,THE ARGUMENT.,
246,THE ARGUMENT.,Meantime imperial Neptune heard the sound
247,THE ARGUMENT.,Of raging billows breaking on the ground.
248,THE ARGUMENT.,"Displeas’d, and fearing for his wat’ry reign,"
249,THE ARGUMENT.,"He rear’d his awful head above the main,"
250,THE ARGUMENT.,Serene in majesty; then roll’d his eyes
251,THE ARGUMENT.,"Around the space of earth, and seas, and skies."
252,THE ARGUMENT.,"He saw the Trojan fleet dispers’d, distress’d,"
253,THE ARGUMENT.,By stormy winds and wintry heav’n oppress’d.
254,THE ARGUMENT.,"Full well the god his sister’s envy knew,"
255,THE ARGUMENT.,And what her aims and what her arts pursue.
256,THE ARGUMENT.,"He summon’d Eurus and the western blast,"
257,THE ARGUMENT.,And first an angry glance on both he cast;
258,THE ARGUMENT.,Then thus rebuk’d: “Audacious winds! from whence
259,THE ARGUMENT.,"This bold attempt, this rebel insolence?"
260,THE ARGUMENT.,"Is it for you to ravage seas and land,"
261,THE ARGUMENT.,Unauthoriz’d by my supreme command?
262,THE ARGUMENT.,To raise such mountains on the troubled main?
263,THE ARGUMENT.,Whom I—but first ’tis fit the billows to restrain;
264,THE ARGUMENT.,And then you shall be taught obedience to my reign.
265,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hence! to your lord my royal mandate bear,"
266,THE ARGUMENT.,The realms of ocean and the fields of air
267,THE ARGUMENT.,"Are mine, not his. By fatal lot to me"
268,THE ARGUMENT.,"The liquid empire fell, and trident of the sea."
269,THE ARGUMENT.,His pow’r to hollow caverns is confin’d:
270,THE ARGUMENT.,"There let him reign, the jailer of the wind,"
271,THE ARGUMENT.,"With hoarse commands his breathing subjects call,"
272,THE ARGUMENT.,And boast and bluster in his empty hall.”
273,THE ARGUMENT.,"He spoke; and, while he spoke, he smooth’d the sea,"
274,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dispell’d the darkness, and restor’d the day."
275,THE ARGUMENT.,"Cymothoe, Triton, and the sea-green train"
276,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of beauteous nymphs, the daughters of the main,"
277,THE ARGUMENT.,Clear from the rocks the vessels with their hands:
278,THE ARGUMENT.,"The god himself with ready trident stands,"
279,THE ARGUMENT.,"And opes the deep, and spreads the moving sands;"
280,THE ARGUMENT.,Then heaves them off the shoals. Where’er he guides
281,THE ARGUMENT.,"His finny coursers and in triumph rides,"
282,THE ARGUMENT.,The waves unruffle and the sea subsides.
283,THE ARGUMENT.,"As, when in tumults rise th’ ignoble crowd,"
284,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mad are their motions, and their tongues are loud;"
285,THE ARGUMENT.,"And stones and brands in rattling volleys fly,"
286,THE ARGUMENT.,And all the rustic arms that fury can supply:
287,THE ARGUMENT.,"If then some grave and pious man appear,"
288,THE ARGUMENT.,"They hush their noise, and lend a list’ning ear;"
289,THE ARGUMENT.,"He soothes with sober words their angry mood,"
290,THE ARGUMENT.,And quenches their innate desire of blood:
291,THE ARGUMENT.,"So, when the Father of the Flood appears,"
292,THE ARGUMENT.,"And o’er the seas his sov’reign trident rears,"
293,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their fury falls: he skims the liquid plains,"
294,THE ARGUMENT.,"High on his chariot, and, with loosen’d reins,"
295,THE ARGUMENT.,"Majestic moves along, and awful peace maintains."
296,THE ARGUMENT.,The weary Trojans ply their shatter’d oars
297,THE ARGUMENT.,"To nearest land, and make the Libyan shores."
298,THE ARGUMENT.,
299,THE ARGUMENT.,Within a long recess there lies a bay:
300,THE ARGUMENT.,"An island shades it from the rolling sea,"
301,THE ARGUMENT.,And forms a port secure for ships to ride;
302,THE ARGUMENT.,"Broke by the jutting land, on either side,"
303,THE ARGUMENT.,In double streams the briny waters glide.
304,THE ARGUMENT.,Betwixt two rows of rocks a sylvan scene
305,THE ARGUMENT.,"Appears above, and groves for ever green:"
306,THE ARGUMENT.,"A grot is form’d beneath, with mossy seats,"
307,THE ARGUMENT.,"To rest the Nereids, and exclude the heats."
308,THE ARGUMENT.,Down thro’ the crannies of the living walls
309,THE ARGUMENT.,The crystal streams descend in murm’ring falls:
310,THE ARGUMENT.,"No haulsers need to bind the vessels here,"
311,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor bearded anchors; for no storms they fear.
312,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sev’n ships within this happy harbour meet,"
313,THE ARGUMENT.,The thin remainders of the scatter’d fleet.
314,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojans, worn with toils, and spent with woes,"
315,THE ARGUMENT.,"Leap on the welcome land, and seek their wish’d repose."
316,THE ARGUMENT.,
317,THE ARGUMENT.,"First, good Achates, with repeated strokes"
318,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of clashing flints, their hidden fire provokes:"
319,THE ARGUMENT.,Short flame succeeds; a bed of wither’d leaves
320,THE ARGUMENT.,The dying sparkles in their fall receives:
321,THE ARGUMENT.,"Caught into life, in fiery fumes they rise,"
322,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, fed with stronger food, invade the skies."
323,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojans, dropping wet, or stand around"
324,THE ARGUMENT.,"The cheerful blaze, or lie along the ground:"
325,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some dry their corn, infected with the brine,"
326,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then grind with marbles, and prepare to dine."
327,THE ARGUMENT.,"Aeneas climbs the mountain’s airy brow,"
328,THE ARGUMENT.,"And takes a prospect of the seas below,"
329,THE ARGUMENT.,"If Capys thence, or Antheus he could spy,"
330,THE ARGUMENT.,Or see the streamers of Caicus fly.
331,THE ARGUMENT.,"No vessels were in view; but, on the plain,"
332,THE ARGUMENT.,Three beamy stags command a lordly train
333,THE ARGUMENT.,Of branching heads: the more ignoble throng
334,THE ARGUMENT.,"Attend their stately steps, and slowly graze along."
335,THE ARGUMENT.,"He stood; and, while secure they fed below,"
336,THE ARGUMENT.,He took the quiver and the trusty bow
337,THE ARGUMENT.,Achates us’d to bear: the leaders first
338,THE ARGUMENT.,"He laid along, and then the vulgar pierc’d;"
339,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor ceas’d his arrows, till the shady plain"
340,THE ARGUMENT.,Sev’n mighty bodies with their blood distain.
341,THE ARGUMENT.,"For the sev’n ships he made an equal share,"
342,THE ARGUMENT.,"And to the port return’d, triumphant from the war."
343,THE ARGUMENT.,"The jars of gen’rous wine (Acestes’ gift,"
344,THE ARGUMENT.,When his Trinacrian shores the navy left)
345,THE ARGUMENT.,"He set abroach, and for the feast prepar’d,"
346,THE ARGUMENT.,In equal portions with the ven’son shar’d.
347,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus while he dealt it round, the pious chief"
348,THE ARGUMENT.,With cheerful words allay’d the common grief:
349,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Endure, and conquer! Jove will soon dispose"
350,THE ARGUMENT.,To future good our past and present woes.
351,THE ARGUMENT.,"With me, the rocks of Scylla you have tried;"
352,THE ARGUMENT.,Th’ inhuman Cyclops and his den defied.
353,THE ARGUMENT.,What greater ills hereafter can you bear?
354,THE ARGUMENT.,"Resume your courage and dismiss your care,"
355,THE ARGUMENT.,"An hour will come, with pleasure to relate"
356,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your sorrows past, as benefits of Fate."
357,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thro’ various hazards and events, we move"
358,THE ARGUMENT.,To Latium and the realms foredoom’d by Jove.
359,THE ARGUMENT.,Call’d to the seat (the promise of the skies)
360,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where Trojan kingdoms once again may rise,"
361,THE ARGUMENT.,Endure the hardships of your present state;
362,THE ARGUMENT.,"Live, and reserve yourselves for better fate.”"
363,THE ARGUMENT.,
364,THE ARGUMENT.,"These words he spoke, but spoke not from his heart;"
365,THE ARGUMENT.,His outward smiles conceal’d his inward smart.
366,THE ARGUMENT.,"The jolly crew, unmindful of the past,"
367,THE ARGUMENT.,"The quarry share, their plenteous dinner haste."
368,THE ARGUMENT.,Some strip the skin; some portion out the spoil;
369,THE ARGUMENT.,"The limbs, yet trembling, in the caldrons boil;"
370,THE ARGUMENT.,Some on the fire the reeking entrails broil.
371,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stretch’d on the grassy turf, at ease they dine,"
372,THE ARGUMENT.,"Restore their strength with meat, and cheer their souls with"
373,THE ARGUMENT.,wine.
374,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their hunger thus appeas’d, their care attends"
375,THE ARGUMENT.,The doubtful fortune of their absent friends:
376,THE ARGUMENT.,"Alternate hopes and fears their minds possess,"
377,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whether to deem ’em dead, or in distress."
378,THE ARGUMENT.,"Above the rest, Aeneas mourns the fate"
379,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of brave Orontes, and th’ uncertain state"
380,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of Gyas, Lycus, and of Amycus."
381,THE ARGUMENT.,"The day, but not their sorrows, ended thus."
382,THE ARGUMENT.,
383,THE ARGUMENT.,"When, from aloft, almighty Jove surveys"
384,THE ARGUMENT.,"Earth, air, and shores, and navigable seas,"
385,THE ARGUMENT.,At length on Libyan realms he fix’d his eyes:
386,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whom, pond’ring thus on human miseries,"
387,THE ARGUMENT.,"When Venus saw, she with a lowly look,"
388,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not free from tears, her heav’nly sire bespoke:"
389,THE ARGUMENT.,
390,THE ARGUMENT.,“O King of Gods and Men! whose awful hand
391,THE ARGUMENT.,"Disperses thunder on the seas and land,"
392,THE ARGUMENT.,Disposing all with absolute command;
393,THE ARGUMENT.,How could my pious son thy pow’r incense?
394,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or what, alas! is vanish’d Troy’s offence?"
395,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our hope of Italy not only lost,"
396,THE ARGUMENT.,"On various seas by various tempests toss’d,"
397,THE ARGUMENT.,"But shut from ev’ry shore, and barr’d from ev’ry coast."
398,THE ARGUMENT.,"You promis’d once, a progeny divine"
399,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of Romans, rising from the Trojan line,"
400,THE ARGUMENT.,"In after times should hold the world in awe,"
401,THE ARGUMENT.,And to the land and ocean give the law.
402,THE ARGUMENT.,"How is your doom revers’d, which eas’d my care"
403,THE ARGUMENT.,When Troy was ruin’d in that cruel war?
404,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then fates to fates I could oppose; but now,"
405,THE ARGUMENT.,"When Fortune still pursues her former blow,"
406,THE ARGUMENT.,What can I hope? What worse can still succeed?
407,THE ARGUMENT.,What end of labours has your will decreed?
408,THE ARGUMENT.,"Antenor, from the midst of Grecian hosts,"
409,THE ARGUMENT.,"Could pass secure, and pierce th’ Illyrian coasts,"
410,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where, rolling down the steep, Timavus raves"
411,THE ARGUMENT.,And thro’ nine channels disembogues his waves.
412,THE ARGUMENT.,"At length he founded Padua’s happy seat,"
413,THE ARGUMENT.,And gave his Trojans a secure retreat;
414,THE ARGUMENT.,"There fix’d their arms, and there renew’d their name,"
415,THE ARGUMENT.,"And there in quiet rules, and crown’d with fame."
416,THE ARGUMENT.,"But we, descended from your sacred line,"
417,THE ARGUMENT.,"Entitled to your heav’n and rites divine,"
418,THE ARGUMENT.,"Are banish’d earth; and, for the wrath of one,"
419,THE ARGUMENT.,Remov’d from Latium and the promis’d throne.
420,THE ARGUMENT.,Are these our scepters? these our due rewards?
421,THE ARGUMENT.,And is it thus that Jove his plighted faith regards?”
422,THE ARGUMENT.,
423,THE ARGUMENT.,"To whom the Father of th’ immortal race,"
424,THE ARGUMENT.,"Smiling with that serene indulgent face,"
425,THE ARGUMENT.,"With which he drives the clouds and clears the skies,"
426,THE ARGUMENT.,First gave a holy kiss; then thus replies:
427,THE ARGUMENT.,
428,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Daughter, dismiss thy fears; to thy desire"
429,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fates of thine are fix’d, and stand entire."
430,THE ARGUMENT.,Thou shalt behold thy wish’d Lavinian walls;
431,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, ripe for heav’n, when fate Aeneas calls,"
432,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then shalt thou bear him up, sublime, to me:"
433,THE ARGUMENT.,No councils have revers’d my firm decree.
434,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, lest new fears disturb thy happy state,"
435,THE ARGUMENT.,"Know, I have search’d the mystic rolls of Fate:"
436,THE ARGUMENT.,Thy son (nor is th’ appointed season far)
437,THE ARGUMENT.,"In Italy shall wage successful war,"
438,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shall tame fierce nations in the bloody field,"
439,THE ARGUMENT.,"And sov’reign laws impose, and cities build,"
440,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till, after ev’ry foe subdued, the sun"
441,THE ARGUMENT.,Thrice thro’ the signs his annual race shall run:
442,THE ARGUMENT.,"This is his time prefix’d. Ascanius then,"
443,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now call’d Iulus, shall begin his reign."
444,THE ARGUMENT.,"He thirty rolling years the crown shall wear,"
445,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then from Lavinium shall the seat transfer,"
446,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, with hard labour, Alba Longa build."
447,THE ARGUMENT.,The throne with his succession shall be fill’d
448,THE ARGUMENT.,Three hundred circuits more: then shall be seen
449,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ilia the fair, a priestess and a queen,"
450,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who, full of Mars, in time, with kindly throes,"
451,THE ARGUMENT.,Shall at a birth two goodly boys disclose.
452,THE ARGUMENT.,The royal babes a tawny wolf shall drain:
453,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Romulus his grandsire’s throne shall gain,"
454,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of martial tow’rs the founder shall become,"
455,THE ARGUMENT.,"The people Romans call, the city Rome."
456,THE ARGUMENT.,"To them no bounds of empire I assign,"
457,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor term of years to their immortal line.
458,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ev’n haughty Juno, who, with endless broils,"
459,THE ARGUMENT.,"Earth, seas, and heav’n, and Jove himself turmoils;"
460,THE ARGUMENT.,"At length aton’d, her friendly pow’r shall join,"
461,THE ARGUMENT.,To cherish and advance the Trojan line.
462,THE ARGUMENT.,"The subject world shall Rome’s dominion own,"
463,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, prostrate, shall adore the nation of the gown."
464,THE ARGUMENT.,An age is ripening in revolving fate
465,THE ARGUMENT.,"When Troy shall overturn the Grecian state,"
466,THE ARGUMENT.,"And sweet revenge her conqu’ring sons shall call,"
467,THE ARGUMENT.,To crush the people that conspir’d her fall.
468,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Caesar from the Julian stock shall rise,"
469,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whose empire ocean, and whose fame the skies"
470,THE ARGUMENT.,"Alone shall bound; whom, fraught with eastern spoils,"
471,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our heav’n, the just reward of human toils,"
472,THE ARGUMENT.,Securely shall repay with rites divine;
473,THE ARGUMENT.,And incense shall ascend before his sacred shrine.
474,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then dire debate and impious war shall cease,"
475,THE ARGUMENT.,And the stern age be soften’d into peace:
476,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then banish’d Faith shall once again return,"
477,THE ARGUMENT.,And Vestal fires in hallow’d temples burn;
478,THE ARGUMENT.,And Remus with Quirinus shall sustain
479,THE ARGUMENT.,"The righteous laws, and fraud and force restrain."
480,THE ARGUMENT.,"Janus himself before his fane shall wait,"
481,THE ARGUMENT.,"And keep the dreadful issues of his gate,"
482,THE ARGUMENT.,With bolts and iron bars: within remains
483,THE ARGUMENT.,"Imprison’d Fury, bound in brazen chains;"
484,THE ARGUMENT.,"High on a trophy rais’d, of useless arms,"
485,THE ARGUMENT.,"He sits, and threats the world with vain alarms.”"
486,THE ARGUMENT.,
487,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said, and sent Cyllenius with command"
488,THE ARGUMENT.,"To free the ports, and ope the Punic land"
489,THE ARGUMENT.,"To Trojan guests; lest, ignorant of fate,"
490,THE ARGUMENT.,The queen might force them from her town and state.
491,THE ARGUMENT.,"Down from the steep of heav’n Cyllenius flies,"
492,THE ARGUMENT.,And cleaves with all his wings the yielding skies.
493,THE ARGUMENT.,"Soon on the Libyan shore descends the god,"
494,THE ARGUMENT.,"Performs his message, and displays his rod:"
495,THE ARGUMENT.,The surly murmurs of the people cease;
496,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, as the fates requir’d, they give the peace:"
497,THE ARGUMENT.,"The queen herself suspends the rigid laws,"
498,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojans pities, and protects their cause."
499,THE ARGUMENT.,
500,THE ARGUMENT.,"Meantime, in shades of night Aeneas lies:"
501,THE ARGUMENT.,"Care seiz’d his soul, and sleep forsook his eyes."
502,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, when the sun restor’d the cheerful day,"
503,THE ARGUMENT.,"He rose, the coast and country to survey,"
504,THE ARGUMENT.,Anxious and eager to discover more.
505,THE ARGUMENT.,It look’d a wild uncultivated shore;
506,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, whether humankind, or beasts alone"
507,THE ARGUMENT.,"Possess’d the new-found region, was unknown."
508,THE ARGUMENT.,Beneath a ledge of rocks his fleet he hides:
509,THE ARGUMENT.,Tall trees surround the mountain’s shady sides;
510,THE ARGUMENT.,The bending brow above a safe retreat provides.
511,THE ARGUMENT.,"Arm’d with two pointed darts, he leaves his friends,"
512,THE ARGUMENT.,And true Achates on his steps attends.
513,THE ARGUMENT.,"Lo! in the deep recesses of the wood,"
514,THE ARGUMENT.,Before his eyes his goddess mother stood:
515,THE ARGUMENT.,A huntress in her habit and her mien;
516,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her dress a maid, her air confess’d a queen."
517,THE ARGUMENT.,"Bare were her knees, and knots her garments bind;"
518,THE ARGUMENT.,"Loose was her hair, and wanton’d in the wind;"
519,THE ARGUMENT.,Her hand sustain’d a bow; her quiver hung behind.
520,THE ARGUMENT.,She seem’d a virgin of the Spartan blood:
521,THE ARGUMENT.,With such array Harpalyce bestrode
522,THE ARGUMENT.,Her Thracian courser and outstripp’d the rapid flood.
523,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Ho, strangers! have you lately seen,” she said,"
524,THE ARGUMENT.,"“One of my sisters, like myself array’d,"
525,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who cross’d the lawn, or in the forest stray’d?"
526,THE ARGUMENT.,A painted quiver at her back she bore;
527,THE ARGUMENT.,"Varied with spots, a lynx’s hide she wore;"
528,THE ARGUMENT.,And at full cry pursued the tusky boar.”
529,THE ARGUMENT.,
530,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus Venus: thus her son replied again:
531,THE ARGUMENT.,"“None of your sisters have we heard or seen,"
532,THE ARGUMENT.,O virgin! or what other name you bear
533,THE ARGUMENT.,Above that style; O more than mortal fair!
534,THE ARGUMENT.,Your voice and mien celestial birth betray!
535,THE ARGUMENT.,"If, as you seem, the sister of the day,"
536,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or one at least of chaste Diana’s train,"
537,THE ARGUMENT.,Let not an humble suppliant sue in vain;
538,THE ARGUMENT.,"But tell a stranger, long in tempests toss’d,"
539,THE ARGUMENT.,"What earth we tread, and who commands the coast?"
540,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then on your name shall wretched mortals call,"
541,THE ARGUMENT.,And offer’d victims at your altars fall.”
542,THE ARGUMENT.,"“I dare not,” she replied, “assume the name"
543,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of goddess, or celestial honours claim:"
544,THE ARGUMENT.,"For Tyrian virgins bows and quivers bear,"
545,THE ARGUMENT.,And purple buskins o’er their ankles wear.
546,THE ARGUMENT.,"Know, gentle youth, in Libyan lands you are:"
547,THE ARGUMENT.,"A people rude in peace, and rough in war."
548,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rising city, which from far you see,"
549,THE ARGUMENT.,"Is Carthage, and a Tyrian colony."
550,THE ARGUMENT.,"Phoenician Dido rules the growing state,"
551,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who fled from Tyre, to shun her brother’s hate."
552,THE ARGUMENT.,"Great were her wrongs, her story full of fate;"
553,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which I will sum in short. Sichaeus, known"
554,THE ARGUMENT.,"For wealth, and brother to the Punic throne,"
555,THE ARGUMENT.,Possess’d fair Dido’s bed; and either heart
556,THE ARGUMENT.,At once was wounded with an equal dart.
557,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her father gave her, yet a spotless maid;"
558,THE ARGUMENT.,Pygmalion then the Tyrian scepter sway’d:
559,THE ARGUMENT.,One who condemn’d divine and human laws.
560,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then strife ensued, and cursed gold the cause."
561,THE ARGUMENT.,"The monarch, blinded with desire of wealth,"
562,THE ARGUMENT.,With steel invades his brother’s life by stealth;
563,THE ARGUMENT.,"Before the sacred altar made him bleed,"
564,THE ARGUMENT.,And long from her conceal’d the cruel deed.
565,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some tale, some new pretence, he daily coin’d,"
566,THE ARGUMENT.,"To soothe his sister, and delude her mind."
567,THE ARGUMENT.,"At length, in dead of night, the ghost appears"
568,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of her unhappy lord: the spectre stares,"
569,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, with erected eyes, his bloody bosom bares."
570,THE ARGUMENT.,"The cruel altars and his fate he tells,"
571,THE ARGUMENT.,"And the dire secret of his house reveals,"
572,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then warns the widow, with her household gods,"
573,THE ARGUMENT.,To seek a refuge in remote abodes.
574,THE ARGUMENT.,"Last, to support her in so long a way,"
575,THE ARGUMENT.,He shows her where his hidden treasure lay.
576,THE ARGUMENT.,"Admonish’d thus, and seiz’d with mortal fright,"
577,THE ARGUMENT.,The queen provides companions of her flight:
578,THE ARGUMENT.,"They meet, and all combine to leave the state,"
579,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who hate the tyrant, or who fear his hate."
580,THE ARGUMENT.,"They seize a fleet, which ready rigg’d they find;"
581,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor is Pygmalion’s treasure left behind.
582,THE ARGUMENT.,"The vessels, heavy laden, put to sea"
583,THE ARGUMENT.,With prosp’rous winds; a woman leads the way.
584,THE ARGUMENT.,"I know not, if by stress of weather driv’n,"
585,THE ARGUMENT.,Or was their fatal course dispos’d by Heav’n;
586,THE ARGUMENT.,"At last they landed, where from far your eyes"
587,THE ARGUMENT.,May view the turrets of new Carthage rise;
588,THE ARGUMENT.,"There bought a space of ground, which Byrsa call’d,"
589,THE ARGUMENT.,"From the bull’s hide, they first inclos’d, and wall’d."
590,THE ARGUMENT.,But whence are you? what country claims your birth?
591,THE ARGUMENT.,"What seek you, strangers, on our Libyan earth?”"
592,THE ARGUMENT.,
593,THE ARGUMENT.,"To whom, with sorrow streaming from his eyes,"
594,THE ARGUMENT.,"And deeply sighing, thus her son replies:"
595,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Could you with patience hear, or I relate,"
596,THE ARGUMENT.,"O nymph, the tedious annals of our fate!"
597,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thro’ such a train of woes if I should run,"
598,THE ARGUMENT.,The day would sooner than the tale be done!
599,THE ARGUMENT.,"From ancient Troy, by force expell’d, we came,"
600,THE ARGUMENT.,If you by chance have heard the Trojan name.
601,THE ARGUMENT.,"On various seas by various tempests toss’d,"
602,THE ARGUMENT.,At length we landed on your Libyan coast.
603,THE ARGUMENT.,"The good Aeneas am I call’d, a name,"
604,THE ARGUMENT.,"While Fortune favour’d, not unknown to fame."
605,THE ARGUMENT.,"My household gods, companions of my woes,"
606,THE ARGUMENT.,With pious care I rescued from our foes.
607,THE ARGUMENT.,To fruitful Italy my course was bent;
608,THE ARGUMENT.,And from the King of Heav’n is my descent.
609,THE ARGUMENT.,With twice ten sail I cross’d the Phrygian sea;
610,THE ARGUMENT.,Fate and my mother goddess led my way.
611,THE ARGUMENT.,"Scarce sev’n, the thin remainders of my fleet,"
612,THE ARGUMENT.,"From storms preserv’d, within your harbour meet."
613,THE ARGUMENT.,"Myself distress’d, an exile, and unknown,"
614,THE ARGUMENT.,"Debarr’d from Europe, and from Asia thrown,"
615,THE ARGUMENT.,In Libyan deserts wander thus alone.”
616,THE ARGUMENT.,
617,THE ARGUMENT.,His tender parent could no longer bear;
618,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, interposing, sought to soothe his care."
619,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Whoe’er you are, not unbelov’d by Heav’n,"
620,THE ARGUMENT.,Since on our friendly shore your ships are driv’n:
621,THE ARGUMENT.,"Have courage: to the gods permit the rest,"
622,THE ARGUMENT.,And to the queen expose your just request.
623,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now take this earnest of success, for more:"
624,THE ARGUMENT.,Your scatter’d fleet is join’d upon the shore;
625,THE ARGUMENT.,"The winds are chang’d, your friends from danger free;"
626,THE ARGUMENT.,Or I renounce my skill in augury.
627,THE ARGUMENT.,"Twelve swans behold in beauteous order move,"
628,THE ARGUMENT.,And stoop with closing pinions from above;
629,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whom late the bird of Jove had driv’n along,"
630,THE ARGUMENT.,And thro’ the clouds pursued the scatt’ring throng:
631,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, all united in a goodly team,"
632,THE ARGUMENT.,"They skim the ground, and seek the quiet stream."
633,THE ARGUMENT.,"As they, with joy returning, clap their wings,"
634,THE ARGUMENT.,And ride the circuit of the skies in rings;
635,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not otherwise your ships, and ev’ry friend,"
636,THE ARGUMENT.,"Already hold the port, or with swift sails descend."
637,THE ARGUMENT.,No more advice is needful; but pursue
638,THE ARGUMENT.,"The path before you, and the town in view.”"
639,THE ARGUMENT.,
640,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus having said, she turn’d, and made appear"
641,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her neck refulgent, and dishevel’d hair,"
642,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which, flowing from her shoulders, reach’d the ground."
643,THE ARGUMENT.,And widely spread ambrosial scents around:
644,THE ARGUMENT.,In length of train descends her sweeping gown;
645,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, by her graceful walk, the Queen of Love is known."
646,THE ARGUMENT.,The prince pursued the parting deity
647,THE ARGUMENT.,With words like these: “Ah! whither do you fly?
648,THE ARGUMENT.,Unkind and cruel! to deceive your son
649,THE ARGUMENT.,"In borrow’d shapes, and his embrace to shun;"
650,THE ARGUMENT.,"Never to bless my sight, but thus unknown;"
651,THE ARGUMENT.,And still to speak in accents not your own.”
652,THE ARGUMENT.,"Against the goddess these complaints he made,"
653,THE ARGUMENT.,"But took the path, and her commands obey’d."
654,THE ARGUMENT.,"They march, obscure; for Venus kindly shrouds"
655,THE ARGUMENT.,"With mists their persons, and involves in clouds,"
656,THE ARGUMENT.,"That, thus unseen, their passage none might stay,"
657,THE ARGUMENT.,Or force to tell the causes of their way.
658,THE ARGUMENT.,"This part perform’d, the goddess flies sublime"
659,THE ARGUMENT.,To visit Paphos and her native clime;
660,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where garlands, ever green and ever fair,"
661,THE ARGUMENT.,"With vows are offer’d, and with solemn pray’r:"
662,THE ARGUMENT.,A hundred altars in her temple smoke;
663,THE ARGUMENT.,A thousand bleeding hearts her pow’r invoke.
664,THE ARGUMENT.,
665,THE ARGUMENT.,"They climb the next ascent, and, looking down,"
666,THE ARGUMENT.,Now at a nearer distance view the town.
667,THE ARGUMENT.,"The prince with wonder sees the stately tow’rs,"
668,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which late were huts and shepherds’ homely bow’rs,"
669,THE ARGUMENT.,"The gates and streets; and hears, from ev’ry part,"
670,THE ARGUMENT.,The noise and busy concourse of the mart.
671,THE ARGUMENT.,The toiling Tyrians on each other call
672,THE ARGUMENT.,To ply their labour: some extend the wall;
673,THE ARGUMENT.,Some build the citadel; the brawny throng
674,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or dig, or push unwieldly stones along."
675,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some for their dwellings choose a spot of ground,"
676,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which, first design’d, with ditches they surround."
677,THE ARGUMENT.,Some laws ordain; and some attend the choice
678,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of holy senates, and elect by voice."
679,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here some design a mole, while others there"
680,THE ARGUMENT.,Lay deep foundations for a theatre;
681,THE ARGUMENT.,"From marble quarries mighty columns hew,"
682,THE ARGUMENT.,"For ornaments of scenes, and future view."
683,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such is their toil, and such their busy pains,"
684,THE ARGUMENT.,"As exercise the bees in flow’ry plains,"
685,THE ARGUMENT.,"When winter past, and summer scarce begun,"
686,THE ARGUMENT.,Invites them forth to labour in the sun;
687,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some lead their youth abroad, while some condense"
688,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their liquid store, and some in cells dispense;"
689,THE ARGUMENT.,Some at the gate stand ready to receive
690,THE ARGUMENT.,"The golden burthen, and their friends relieve;"
691,THE ARGUMENT.,"All with united force, combine to drive"
692,THE ARGUMENT.,The lazy drones from the laborious hive:
693,THE ARGUMENT.,"With envy stung, they view each other’s deeds;"
694,THE ARGUMENT.,The fragrant work with diligence proceeds.
695,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Thrice happy you, whose walls already rise!”"
696,THE ARGUMENT.,"Aeneas said, and view’d, with lifted eyes,"
697,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their lofty tow’rs; then, ent’ring at the gate,"
698,THE ARGUMENT.,Conceal’d in clouds (prodigious to relate)
699,THE ARGUMENT.,"He mix’d, unmark’d, among the busy throng,"
700,THE ARGUMENT.,"Borne by the tide, and pass’d unseen along."
701,THE ARGUMENT.,
702,THE ARGUMENT.,"Full in the centre of the town there stood,"
703,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thick set with trees, a venerable wood."
704,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Tyrians, landing near this holy ground,"
705,THE ARGUMENT.,"And digging here, a prosp’rous omen found:"
706,THE ARGUMENT.,"From under earth a courser’s head they drew,"
707,THE ARGUMENT.,Their growth and future fortune to foreshew.
708,THE ARGUMENT.,"This fated sign their foundress Juno gave,"
709,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of a soil fruitful, and a people brave."
710,THE ARGUMENT.,Sidonian Dido here with solemn state
711,THE ARGUMENT.,"Did Juno’s temple build, and consecrate,"
712,THE ARGUMENT.,"Enrich’d with gifts, and with a golden shrine;"
713,THE ARGUMENT.,But more the goddess made the place divine.
714,THE ARGUMENT.,"On brazen steps the marble threshold rose,"
715,THE ARGUMENT.,And brazen plates the cedar beams inclose:
716,THE ARGUMENT.,The rafters are with brazen cov’rings crown’d;
717,THE ARGUMENT.,The lofty doors on brazen hinges sound.
718,THE ARGUMENT.,"What first Aeneas in this place beheld,"
719,THE ARGUMENT.,"Reviv’d his courage, and his fear expell’d."
720,THE ARGUMENT.,"For while, expecting there the queen, he rais’d"
721,THE ARGUMENT.,"His wond’ring eyes, and round the temple gaz’d,"
722,THE ARGUMENT.,"Admir’d the fortune of the rising town,"
723,THE ARGUMENT.,"The striving artists, and their arts’ renown;"
724,THE ARGUMENT.,"He saw, in order painted on the wall,"
725,THE ARGUMENT.,Whatever did unhappy Troy befall:
726,THE ARGUMENT.,"The wars that fame around the world had blown,"
727,THE ARGUMENT.,"All to the life, and ev’ry leader known."
728,THE ARGUMENT.,"There Agamemnon, Priam here, he spies,"
729,THE ARGUMENT.,"And fierce Achilles, who both kings defies."
730,THE ARGUMENT.,"He stopp’d, and weeping said: “O friend! ev’n here"
731,THE ARGUMENT.,The monuments of Trojan woes appear!
732,THE ARGUMENT.,Our known disasters fill ev’n foreign lands:
733,THE ARGUMENT.,"See there, where old unhappy Priam stands!"
734,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ev’n the mute walls relate the warrior’s fame,"
735,THE ARGUMENT.,And Trojan griefs the Tyrians’ pity claim.”
736,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said, his tears a ready passage find,"
737,THE ARGUMENT.,"Devouring what he saw so well design’d,"
738,THE ARGUMENT.,And with an empty picture fed his mind:
739,THE ARGUMENT.,"For there he saw the fainting Grecians yield,"
740,THE ARGUMENT.,"And here the trembling Trojans quit the field,"
741,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pursued by fierce Achilles thro’ the plain,"
742,THE ARGUMENT.,On his high chariot driving o’er the slain.
743,THE ARGUMENT.,"The tents of Rhesus next, his grief renew,"
744,THE ARGUMENT.,By their white sails betray’d to nightly view;
745,THE ARGUMENT.,"And wakeful Diomede, whose cruel sword"
746,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sentries slew, nor spar’d their slumb’ring lord,"
747,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then took the fiery steeds, ere yet the food"
748,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of Troy they taste, or drink the Xanthian flood."
749,THE ARGUMENT.,Elsewhere he saw where Troilus defied
750,THE ARGUMENT.,"Achilles, and unequal combat tried;"
751,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, where the boy disarm’d, with loosen’d reins,"
752,THE ARGUMENT.,"Was by his horses hurried o’er the plains,"
753,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hung by the neck and hair, and dragg’d around:"
754,THE ARGUMENT.,"The hostile spear, yet sticking in his wound,"
755,THE ARGUMENT.,With tracks of blood inscrib’d the dusty ground.
756,THE ARGUMENT.,"Meantime the Trojan dames, oppress’d with woe,"
757,THE ARGUMENT.,"To Pallas’ fane in long procession go,"
758,THE ARGUMENT.,In hopes to reconcile their heav’nly foe.
759,THE ARGUMENT.,"They weep, they beat their breasts, they rend their hair,"
760,THE ARGUMENT.,And rich embroider’d vests for presents bear;
761,THE ARGUMENT.,But the stern goddess stands unmov’d with pray’r.
762,THE ARGUMENT.,Thrice round the Trojan walls Achilles drew
763,THE ARGUMENT.,"The corpse of Hector, whom in fight he slew."
764,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here Priam sues; and there, for sums of gold,"
765,THE ARGUMENT.,The lifeless body of his son is sold.
766,THE ARGUMENT.,"So sad an object, and so well express’d,"
767,THE ARGUMENT.,"Drew sighs and groans from the griev’d hero’s breast,"
768,THE ARGUMENT.,"To see the figure of his lifeless friend,"
769,THE ARGUMENT.,And his old sire his helpless hand extend.
770,THE ARGUMENT.,"Himself he saw amidst the Grecian train,"
771,THE ARGUMENT.,Mix’d in the bloody battle on the plain;
772,THE ARGUMENT.,"And swarthy Memnon in his arms he knew,"
773,THE ARGUMENT.,"His pompous ensigns, and his Indian crew."
774,THE ARGUMENT.,"Penthisilea there, with haughty grace,"
775,THE ARGUMENT.,Leads to the wars an Amazonian race:
776,THE ARGUMENT.,In their right hands a pointed dart they wield;
777,THE ARGUMENT.,"The left, for ward, sustains the lunar shield."
778,THE ARGUMENT.,"Athwart her breast a golden belt she throws,"
779,THE ARGUMENT.,"Amidst the press alone provokes a thousand foes,"
780,THE ARGUMENT.,And dares her maiden arms to manly force oppose.
781,THE ARGUMENT.,
782,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus while the Trojan prince employs his eyes,"
783,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fix’d on the walls with wonder and surprise,"
784,THE ARGUMENT.,"The beauteous Dido, with a num’rous train"
785,THE ARGUMENT.,"And pomp of guards, ascends the sacred fane."
786,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such on Eurotas’ banks, or Cynthus’ height,"
787,THE ARGUMENT.,"Diana seems; and so she charms the sight,"
788,THE ARGUMENT.,When in the dance the graceful goddess leads
789,THE ARGUMENT.,"The choir of nymphs, and overtops their heads:"
790,THE ARGUMENT.,"Known by her quiver, and her lofty mien,"
791,THE ARGUMENT.,"She walks majestic, and she looks their queen;"
792,THE ARGUMENT.,"Latona sees her shine above the rest,"
793,THE ARGUMENT.,And feeds with secret joy her silent breast.
794,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such Dido was; with such becoming state,"
795,THE ARGUMENT.,"Amidst the crowd, she walks serenely great."
796,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their labour to her future sway she speeds,"
797,THE ARGUMENT.,And passing with a gracious glance proceeds;
798,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then mounts the throne, high plac’d before the shrine:"
799,THE ARGUMENT.,"In crowds around, the swarming people join."
800,THE ARGUMENT.,"She takes petitions, and dispenses laws,"
801,THE ARGUMENT.,Hears and determines ev’ry private cause;
802,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their tasks in equal portions she divides,"
803,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, where unequal, there by lots decides."
804,THE ARGUMENT.,Another way by chance Aeneas bends
805,THE ARGUMENT.,"His eyes, and unexpected sees his friends,"
806,THE ARGUMENT.,"Antheus, Sergestus grave, Cloanthus strong,"
807,THE ARGUMENT.,"And at their backs a mighty Trojan throng,"
808,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whom late the tempest on the billows toss’d,"
809,THE ARGUMENT.,And widely scatter’d on another coast.
810,THE ARGUMENT.,"The prince, unseen, surpris’d with wonder stands,"
811,THE ARGUMENT.,"And longs, with joyful haste, to join their hands;"
812,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, doubtful of the wish’d event, he stays,"
813,THE ARGUMENT.,"And from the hollow cloud his friends surveys,"
814,THE ARGUMENT.,"Impatient till they told their present state,"
815,THE ARGUMENT.,"And where they left their ships, and what their fate,"
816,THE ARGUMENT.,"And why they came, and what was their request;"
817,THE ARGUMENT.,"For these were sent, commission’d by the rest,"
818,THE ARGUMENT.,"To sue for leave to land their sickly men,"
819,THE ARGUMENT.,And gain admission to the gracious queen.
820,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ent’ring, with cries they fill’d the holy fane;"
821,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then thus, with lowly voice, Ilioneus began:"
822,THE ARGUMENT.,
823,THE ARGUMENT.,“O Queen! indulg’d by favour of the gods
824,THE ARGUMENT.,"To found an empire in these new abodes,"
825,THE ARGUMENT.,"To build a town, with statutes to restrain"
826,THE ARGUMENT.,"The wild inhabitants beneath thy reign,"
827,THE ARGUMENT.,"We wretched Trojans, toss’d on ev’ry shore,"
828,THE ARGUMENT.,"From sea to sea, thy clemency implore."
829,THE ARGUMENT.,Forbid the fires our shipping to deface!
830,THE ARGUMENT.,"Receive th’ unhappy fugitives to grace,"
831,THE ARGUMENT.,And spare the remnant of a pious race!
832,THE ARGUMENT.,"We come not with design of wasteful prey,"
833,THE ARGUMENT.,"To drive the country, force the swains away:"
834,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor such our strength, nor such is our desire;"
835,THE ARGUMENT.,The vanquish’d dare not to such thoughts aspire.
836,THE ARGUMENT.,"A land there is, Hesperia nam’d of old;"
837,THE ARGUMENT.,"The soil is fruitful, and the men are bold"
838,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ Oenotrians held it once, by common fame"
839,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now call’d Italia, from the leader’s name."
840,THE ARGUMENT.,"To that sweet region was our voyage bent,"
841,THE ARGUMENT.,When winds and ev’ry warring element
842,THE ARGUMENT.,"Disturb’d our course, and, far from sight of land,"
843,THE ARGUMENT.,Cast our torn vessels on the moving sand:
844,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sea came on; the South, with mighty roar,"
845,THE ARGUMENT.,Dispers’d and dash’d the rest upon the rocky shore.
846,THE ARGUMENT.,"Those few you see escap’d the storm, and fear,"
847,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unless you interpose, a shipwreck here."
848,THE ARGUMENT.,"What men, what monsters, what inhuman race,"
849,THE ARGUMENT.,"What laws, what barb’rous customs of the place,"
850,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shut up a desert shore to drowning men,"
851,THE ARGUMENT.,And drive us to the cruel seas again?
852,THE ARGUMENT.,"If our hard fortune no compassion draws,"
853,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor hospitable rights, nor human laws,"
854,THE ARGUMENT.,"The gods are just, and will revenge our cause."
855,THE ARGUMENT.,"Aeneas was our prince: a juster lord,"
856,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or nobler warrior, never drew a sword;"
857,THE ARGUMENT.,"Observant of the right, religious of his word."
858,THE ARGUMENT.,"If yet he lives, and draws this vital air,"
859,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor we, his friends, of safety shall despair;"
860,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor you, great queen, these offices repent,"
861,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which he will equal, and perhaps augment."
862,THE ARGUMENT.,"We want not cities, nor Sicilian coasts,"
863,THE ARGUMENT.,Where King Acestes Trojan lineage boasts.
864,THE ARGUMENT.,"Permit our ships a shelter on your shores,"
865,THE ARGUMENT.,"Refitted from your woods with planks and oars,"
866,THE ARGUMENT.,"That, if our prince be safe, we may renew"
867,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our destin’d course, and Italy pursue."
868,THE ARGUMENT.,"But if, O best of men, the Fates ordain"
869,THE ARGUMENT.,"That thou art swallow’d in the Libyan main,"
870,THE ARGUMENT.,"And if our young Iulus be no more,"
871,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dismiss our navy from your friendly shore,"
872,THE ARGUMENT.,"That we to good Acestes may return,"
873,THE ARGUMENT.,And with our friends our common losses mourn.”
874,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus spoke Ilioneus: the Trojan crew
875,THE ARGUMENT.,With cries and clamours his request renew.
876,THE ARGUMENT.,
877,THE ARGUMENT.,"The modest queen a while, with downcast eyes,"
878,THE ARGUMENT.,Ponder’d the speech; then briefly thus replies:
879,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Trojans, dismiss your fears; my cruel fate,"
880,THE ARGUMENT.,"And doubts attending an unsettled state,"
881,THE ARGUMENT.,Force me to guard my coast from foreign foes.
882,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who has not heard the story of your woes,"
883,THE ARGUMENT.,"The name and fortune of your native place,"
884,THE ARGUMENT.,The fame and valour of the Phrygian race?
885,THE ARGUMENT.,"We Tyrians are not so devoid of sense,"
886,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor so remote from Phoebus’ influence.
887,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whether to Latian shores your course is bent,"
888,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or, driv’n by tempests from your first intent,"
889,THE ARGUMENT.,"You seek the good Acestes’ government,"
890,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your men shall be receiv’d, your fleet repair’d,"
891,THE ARGUMENT.,"And sail, with ships of convoy for your guard:"
892,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or, would you stay, and join your friendly pow’rs"
893,THE ARGUMENT.,"To raise and to defend the Tyrian tow’rs,"
894,THE ARGUMENT.,"My wealth, my city, and myself are yours."
895,THE ARGUMENT.,"And would to Heav’n, the Storm, you felt, would bring"
896,THE ARGUMENT.,On Carthaginian coasts your wand’ring king.
897,THE ARGUMENT.,"My people shall, by my command, explore"
898,THE ARGUMENT.,"The ports and creeks of ev’ry winding shore,"
899,THE ARGUMENT.,"And towns, and wilds, and shady woods, in quest"
900,THE ARGUMENT.,Of so renown’d and so desir’d a guest.”
901,THE ARGUMENT.,
902,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rais’d in his mind the Trojan hero stood,"
903,THE ARGUMENT.,And long’d to break from out his ambient cloud:
904,THE ARGUMENT.,"Achates found it, and thus urg’d his way:"
905,THE ARGUMENT.,"“From whence, O goddess-born, this long delay?"
906,THE ARGUMENT.,"What more can you desire, your welcome sure,"
907,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your fleet in safety, and your friends secure?"
908,THE ARGUMENT.,One only wants; and him we saw in vain
909,THE ARGUMENT.,"Oppose the Storm, and swallow’d in the main."
910,THE ARGUMENT.,Orontes in his fate our forfeit paid;
911,THE ARGUMENT.,The rest agrees with what your mother said.”
912,THE ARGUMENT.,"Scarce had he spoken, when the cloud gave way,"
913,THE ARGUMENT.,The mists flew upward and dissolv’d in day.
914,THE ARGUMENT.,
915,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojan chief appear’d in open sight,"
916,THE ARGUMENT.,"August in visage, and serenely bright."
917,THE ARGUMENT.,"His mother goddess, with her hands divine,"
918,THE ARGUMENT.,"Had form’d his curling locks, and made his temples shine,"
919,THE ARGUMENT.,"And giv’n his rolling eyes a sparkling grace,"
920,THE ARGUMENT.,And breath’d a youthful vigour on his face;
921,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like polish’d ivory, beauteous to behold,"
922,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or Parian marble, when enchas’d in gold:"
923,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus radiant from the circling cloud he broke,"
924,THE ARGUMENT.,And thus with manly modesty he spoke:
925,THE ARGUMENT.,
926,THE ARGUMENT.,"“He whom you seek am I; by tempests toss’d,"
927,THE ARGUMENT.,And sav’d from shipwreck on your Libyan coast;
928,THE ARGUMENT.,"Presenting, gracious queen, before your throne,"
929,THE ARGUMENT.,A prince that owes his life to you alone.
930,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fair majesty, the refuge and redress"
931,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of those whom fate pursues, and wants oppress,"
932,THE ARGUMENT.,"You, who your pious offices employ"
933,THE ARGUMENT.,To save the relics of abandon’d Troy;
934,THE ARGUMENT.,"Receive the shipwreck’d on your friendly shore,"
935,THE ARGUMENT.,With hospitable rites relieve the poor;
936,THE ARGUMENT.,"Associate in your town a wand’ring train,"
937,THE ARGUMENT.,And strangers in your palace entertain:
938,THE ARGUMENT.,"What thanks can wretched fugitives return,"
939,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who, scatter’d thro’ the world, in exile mourn?"
940,THE ARGUMENT.,"The gods, if gods to goodness are inclin’d;"
941,THE ARGUMENT.,"If acts of mercy touch their heav’nly mind,"
942,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, more than all the gods, your gen’rous heart."
943,THE ARGUMENT.,"Conscious of worth, requite its own desert!"
944,THE ARGUMENT.,"In you this age is happy, and this earth,"
945,THE ARGUMENT.,And parents more than mortal gave you birth.
946,THE ARGUMENT.,"While rolling rivers into seas shall run,"
947,THE ARGUMENT.,And round the space of heav’n the radiant sun;
948,THE ARGUMENT.,"While trees the mountain tops with shades supply,"
949,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your honour, name, and praise shall never die."
950,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whate’er abode my fortune has assign’d,"
951,THE ARGUMENT.,Your image shall be present in my mind.”
952,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus having said, he turn’d with pious haste,"
953,THE ARGUMENT.,And joyful his expecting friends embrac’d:
954,THE ARGUMENT.,"With his right hand Ilioneus was grac’d,"
955,THE ARGUMENT.,Serestus with his left; then to his breast
956,THE ARGUMENT.,Cloanthus and the noble Gyas press’d;
957,THE ARGUMENT.,And so by turns descended to the rest.
958,THE ARGUMENT.,
959,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Tyrian queen stood fix’d upon his face,"
960,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pleas’d with his motions, ravish’d with his grace;"
961,THE ARGUMENT.,"Admir’d his fortunes, more admir’d the man;"
962,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then recollected stood, and thus began:"
963,THE ARGUMENT.,"“What fate, O goddess-born; what angry pow’rs"
964,THE ARGUMENT.,Have cast you shipwreck’d on our barren shores?
965,THE ARGUMENT.,"Are you the great Aeneas, known to fame,"
966,THE ARGUMENT.,Who from celestial seed your lineage claim?
967,THE ARGUMENT.,
968,THE ARGUMENT.,The same Aeneas whom fair Venus bore
969,THE ARGUMENT.,To fam’d Anchises on th’ Idaean shore?
970,THE ARGUMENT.,"It calls into my mind, tho’ then a child,"
971,THE ARGUMENT.,"When Teucer came, from Salamis exil’d,"
972,THE ARGUMENT.,"And sought my father’s aid, to be restor’d:"
973,THE ARGUMENT.,My father Belus then with fire and sword
974,THE ARGUMENT.,"Invaded Cyprus, made the region bare,"
975,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, conqu’ring, finish’d the successful war."
976,THE ARGUMENT.,"From him the Trojan siege I understood,"
977,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Grecian chiefs, and your illustrious blood."
978,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your foe himself the Dardan valour prais’d,"
979,THE ARGUMENT.,And his own ancestry from Trojans rais’d.
980,THE ARGUMENT.,"Enter, my noble guest, and you shall find,"
981,THE ARGUMENT.,"If not a costly welcome, yet a kind:"
982,THE ARGUMENT.,"For I myself, like you, have been distress’d,"
983,THE ARGUMENT.,Till Heav’n afforded me this place of rest;
984,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like you, an alien in a land unknown,"
985,THE ARGUMENT.,I learn to pity woes so like my own.”
986,THE ARGUMENT.,"She said, and to the palace led her guest;"
987,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then offer’d incense, and proclaim’d a feast."
988,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor yet less careful for her absent friends,"
989,THE ARGUMENT.,Twice ten fat oxen to the ships she sends;
990,THE ARGUMENT.,"Besides a hundred boars, a hundred lambs,"
991,THE ARGUMENT.,"With bleating cries, attend their milky dams;"
992,THE ARGUMENT.,And jars of gen’rous wine and spacious bowls
993,THE ARGUMENT.,"She gives, to cheer the sailors’ drooping souls."
994,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now purple hangings clothe the palace walls,"
995,THE ARGUMENT.,And sumptuous feasts are made in splendid halls:
996,THE ARGUMENT.,"On Tyrian carpets, richly wrought, they dine;"
997,THE ARGUMENT.,"With loads of massy plate the sideboards shine,"
998,THE ARGUMENT.,"And antique vases, all of gold emboss’d"
999,THE ARGUMENT.,"(The gold itself inferior to the cost),"
1000,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of curious work, where on the sides were seen"
1001,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fights and figures of illustrious men,"
1002,THE ARGUMENT.,From their first founder to the present queen.
1003,THE ARGUMENT.,
1004,THE ARGUMENT.,"The good Aeneas, whose paternal care"
1005,THE ARGUMENT.,"Iulus’ absence could no longer bear,"
1006,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dispatch’d Achates to the ships in haste,"
1007,THE ARGUMENT.,"To give a glad relation of the past,"
1008,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, fraught with precious gifts, to bring the boy,"
1009,THE ARGUMENT.,Snatch’d from the ruins of unhappy Troy:
1010,THE ARGUMENT.,"A robe of tissue, stiff with golden wire;"
1011,THE ARGUMENT.,"An upper vest, once Helen’s rich attire,"
1012,THE ARGUMENT.,"From Argos by the fam’d adultress brought,"
1013,THE ARGUMENT.,"With golden flow’rs and winding foliage wrought,"
1014,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her mother Leda’s present, when she came"
1015,THE ARGUMENT.,To ruin Troy and set the world on flame;
1016,THE ARGUMENT.,"The scepter Priam’s eldest daughter bore,"
1017,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her orient necklace, and the crown she wore"
1018,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of double texture, glorious to behold,"
1019,THE ARGUMENT.,"One order set with gems, and one with gold."
1020,THE ARGUMENT.,"Instructed thus, the wise Achates goes,"
1021,THE ARGUMENT.,And in his diligence his duty shows.
1022,THE ARGUMENT.,
1023,THE ARGUMENT.,"But Venus, anxious for her son’s affairs,"
1024,THE ARGUMENT.,"New counsels tries, and new designs prepares:"
1025,THE ARGUMENT.,That Cupid should assume the shape and face
1026,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of sweet Ascanius, and the sprightly grace;"
1027,THE ARGUMENT.,"Should bring the presents, in her nephew’s stead,"
1028,THE ARGUMENT.,And in Eliza’s veins the gentle poison shed:
1029,THE ARGUMENT.,"For much she fear’d the Tyrians, double-tongued,"
1030,THE ARGUMENT.,And knew the town to Juno’s care belong’d.
1031,THE ARGUMENT.,"These thoughts by night her golden slumbers broke,"
1032,THE ARGUMENT.,"And thus alarm’d, to winged Love she spoke:"
1033,THE ARGUMENT.,"“My son, my strength, whose mighty pow’r alone"
1034,THE ARGUMENT.,"Controls the Thund’rer on his awful throne,"
1035,THE ARGUMENT.,"To thee thy much-afflicted mother flies,"
1036,THE ARGUMENT.,And on thy succour and thy faith relies.
1037,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thou know’st, my son, how Jove’s revengeful wife,"
1038,THE ARGUMENT.,"By force and fraud, attempts thy brother’s life;"
1039,THE ARGUMENT.,And often hast thou mourn’d with me his pains.
1040,THE ARGUMENT.,Him Dido now with blandishment detains;
1041,THE ARGUMENT.,But I suspect the town where Juno reigns.
1042,THE ARGUMENT.,"For this ’tis needful to prevent her art,"
1043,THE ARGUMENT.,And fire with love the proud Phoenician’s heart:
1044,THE ARGUMENT.,"A love so violent, so strong, so sure,"
1045,THE ARGUMENT.,"As neither age can change, nor art can cure."
1046,THE ARGUMENT.,"How this may be perform’d, now take my mind:"
1047,THE ARGUMENT.,Ascanius by his father is design’d
1048,THE ARGUMENT.,"To come, with presents laden, from the port,"
1049,THE ARGUMENT.,"To gratify the queen, and gain the court."
1050,THE ARGUMENT.,"I mean to plunge the boy in pleasing sleep,"
1051,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, ravish’d, in Idalian bow’rs to keep,"
1052,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or high Cythera, that the sweet deceit"
1053,THE ARGUMENT.,"May pass unseen, and none prevent the cheat."
1054,THE ARGUMENT.,Take thou his form and shape. I beg the grace
1055,THE ARGUMENT.,But only for a night’s revolving space:
1056,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thyself a boy, assume a boy’s dissembled face;"
1057,THE ARGUMENT.,"That when, amidst the fervour of the feast,"
1058,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Tyrian hugs and fonds thee on her breast,"
1059,THE ARGUMENT.,"And with sweet kisses in her arms constrains,"
1060,THE ARGUMENT.,Thou may’st infuse thy venom in her veins.”
1061,THE ARGUMENT.,"The God of Love obeys, and sets aside"
1062,THE ARGUMENT.,"His bow and quiver, and his plumy pride;"
1063,THE ARGUMENT.,"He walks Iulus in his mother’s sight,"
1064,THE ARGUMENT.,And in the sweet resemblance takes delight.
1065,THE ARGUMENT.,
1066,THE ARGUMENT.,"The goddess then to young Ascanius flies,"
1067,THE ARGUMENT.,And in a pleasing slumber seals his eyes:
1068,THE ARGUMENT.,"Lull’d in her lap, amidst a train of Loves,"
1069,THE ARGUMENT.,"She gently bears him to her blissful groves,"
1070,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then with a wreath of myrtle crowns his head,"
1071,THE ARGUMENT.,And softly lays him on a flow’ry bed.
1072,THE ARGUMENT.,"Cupid meantime assum’d his form and face,"
1073,THE ARGUMENT.,"Foll’wing Achates with a shorter pace,"
1074,THE ARGUMENT.,And brought the gifts. The queen already sate
1075,THE ARGUMENT.,"Amidst the Trojan lords, in shining state,"
1076,THE ARGUMENT.,High on a golden bed: her princely guest
1077,THE ARGUMENT.,Was next her side; in order sate the rest.
1078,THE ARGUMENT.,Then canisters with bread are heap’d on high;
1079,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ attendants water for their hands supply,"
1080,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, having wash’d, with silken towels dry."
1081,THE ARGUMENT.,Next fifty handmaids in long order bore
1082,THE ARGUMENT.,"The censers, and with fumes the gods adore:"
1083,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then youths, and virgins twice as many, join"
1084,THE ARGUMENT.,"To place the dishes, and to serve the wine."
1085,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Tyrian train, admitted to the feast,"
1086,THE ARGUMENT.,"Approach, and on the painted couches rest."
1087,THE ARGUMENT.,"All on the Trojan gifts with wonder gaze,"
1088,THE ARGUMENT.,"But view the beauteous boy with more amaze,"
1089,THE ARGUMENT.,"His rosy-colour’d cheeks, his radiant eyes,"
1090,THE ARGUMENT.,"His motions, voice, and shape, and all the god’s disguise;"
1091,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor pass unprais’d the vest and veil divine,"
1092,THE ARGUMENT.,Which wand’ring foliage and rich flow’rs entwine.
1093,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, far above the rest, the royal dame,"
1094,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Already doom’d to love’s disastrous flame,)"
1095,THE ARGUMENT.,"With eyes insatiate, and tumultuous joy,"
1096,THE ARGUMENT.,"Beholds the presents, and admires the boy."
1097,THE ARGUMENT.,"The guileful god about the hero long,"
1098,THE ARGUMENT.,"With children’s play, and false embraces, hung;"
1099,THE ARGUMENT.,Then sought the queen: she took him to her arms
1100,THE ARGUMENT.,"With greedy pleasure, and devour’d his charms."
1101,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unhappy Dido little thought what guest,"
1102,THE ARGUMENT.,"How dire a god, she drew so near her breast;"
1103,THE ARGUMENT.,"But he, not mindless of his mother’s pray’r,"
1104,THE ARGUMENT.,"Works in the pliant bosom of the fair,"
1105,THE ARGUMENT.,"And moulds her heart anew, and blots her former care."
1106,THE ARGUMENT.,The dead is to the living love resign’d;
1107,THE ARGUMENT.,And all Aeneas enters in her mind.
1108,THE ARGUMENT.,
1109,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, when the rage of hunger was appeas’d,"
1110,THE ARGUMENT.,"The meat remov’d, and ev’ry guest was pleas’d,"
1111,THE ARGUMENT.,"The golden bowls with sparkling wine are crown’d,"
1112,THE ARGUMENT.,And thro’ the palace cheerful cries resound.
1113,THE ARGUMENT.,From gilded roofs depending lamps display
1114,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nocturnal beams, that emulate the day."
1115,THE ARGUMENT.,"A golden bowl, that shone with gems divine,"
1116,THE ARGUMENT.,The queen commanded to be crown’d with wine:
1117,THE ARGUMENT.,"The bowl that Belus us’d, and all the Tyrian line."
1118,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, silence thro’ the hall proclaim’d, she spoke:"
1119,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O hospitable Jove! we thus invoke,"
1120,THE ARGUMENT.,"With solemn rites, thy sacred name and pow’r;"
1121,THE ARGUMENT.,Bless to both nations this auspicious hour!
1122,THE ARGUMENT.,So may the Trojan and the Tyrian line
1123,THE ARGUMENT.,In lasting concord from this day combine.
1124,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thou, Bacchus, god of joys and friendly cheer,"
1125,THE ARGUMENT.,"And gracious Juno, both be present here!"
1126,THE ARGUMENT.,"And you, my lords of Tyre, your vows address"
1127,THE ARGUMENT.,"To Heav’n with mine, to ratify the peace.”"
1128,THE ARGUMENT.,"The goblet then she took, with nectar crown’d"
1129,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Sprinkling the first libations on the ground,)"
1130,THE ARGUMENT.,And rais’d it to her mouth with sober grace;
1131,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, sipping, offer’d to the next in place."
1132,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Twas Bitias whom she call’d, a thirsty soul;"
1133,THE ARGUMENT.,"He took the challenge, and embrac’d the bowl,"
1134,THE ARGUMENT.,"With pleasure swill’d the gold, nor ceas’d to draw,"
1135,THE ARGUMENT.,Till he the bottom of the brimmer saw.
1136,THE ARGUMENT.,The goblet goes around: Iopas brought
1137,THE ARGUMENT.,"His golden lyre, and sung what ancient Atlas taught:"
1138,THE ARGUMENT.,"The various labours of the wand’ring moon,"
1139,THE ARGUMENT.,And whence proceed th’ eclipses of the sun;
1140,THE ARGUMENT.,Th’ original of men and beasts; and whence
1141,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rains arise, and fires their warmth dispense,"
1142,THE ARGUMENT.,And fix’d and erring stars dispose their influence;
1143,THE ARGUMENT.,What shakes the solid earth; what cause delays
1144,THE ARGUMENT.,The summer nights and shortens winter days.
1145,THE ARGUMENT.,With peals of shouts the Tyrians praise the song:
1146,THE ARGUMENT.,Those peals are echo’d by the Trojan throng.
1147,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ unhappy queen with talk prolong’d the night,"
1148,THE ARGUMENT.,And drank large draughts of love with vast delight;
1149,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of Priam much enquir’d, of Hector more;"
1150,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then ask’d what arms the swarthy Memnon wore,"
1151,THE ARGUMENT.,What troops he landed on the Trojan shore;
1152,THE ARGUMENT.,"The steeds of Diomede varied the discourse,"
1153,THE ARGUMENT.,"And fierce Achilles, with his matchless force;"
1154,THE ARGUMENT.,"At length, as fate and her ill stars requir’d,"
1155,THE ARGUMENT.,To hear the series of the war desir’d.
1156,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Relate at large, my godlike guest,” she said,"
1157,THE ARGUMENT.,"“The Grecian stratagems, the town betray’d:"
1158,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fatal issue of so long a war,"
1159,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your flight, your wand’rings, and your woes, declare;"
1160,THE ARGUMENT.,"For, since on ev’ry sea, on ev’ry coast,"
1161,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your men have been distress’d, your navy toss’d,"
1162,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sev’n times the sun has either tropic view’d,"
1163,THE ARGUMENT.,"The winter banish’d, and the spring renew’d.”"

1171,THE ARGUMENT.,
1172,THE ARGUMENT.,"Aeneas relates how the city of Troy was taken, after a ten years’"
1173,THE ARGUMENT.,"siege, by the treachery of Sinon, and the stratagem of a wooden"
1174,THE ARGUMENT.,horse. He declares the fixed resolution he had taken not to
1175,THE ARGUMENT.,"survive the ruin of his country, and the various adventures he"
1176,THE ARGUMENT.,"met with in defence of it. At last, having been before advised by"
1177,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hector’s ghost, and now by the appearance of his mother Venus, he"
1178,THE ARGUMENT.,"is prevailed upon to leave the town, and settle his household"
1179,THE ARGUMENT.,"gods in another country. In order to this, he carries off his"
1180,THE ARGUMENT.,"father on his shoulders, and leads his little son by the hand,"
1181,THE ARGUMENT.,his wife following behind. When he comes to the place appointed
1182,THE ARGUMENT.,"for the general rendezvous, he finds a great confluence of"
1183,THE ARGUMENT.,"people, but misses his wife, whose ghost afterwards appears to"

1186,THE ARGUMENT.,
1187,THE ARGUMENT.,"All were attentive to the godlike man,"
1188,THE ARGUMENT.,When from his lofty couch he thus began:
1189,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Great queen, what you command me to relate"
1190,THE ARGUMENT.,Renews the sad remembrance of our fate:
1191,THE ARGUMENT.,"An empire from its old foundations rent,"
1192,THE ARGUMENT.,And ev’ry woe the Trojans underwent;
1193,THE ARGUMENT.,A peopled city made a desert place;
1194,THE ARGUMENT.,"All that I saw, and part of which I was:"
1195,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not ev’n the hardest of our foes could hear,"
1196,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor stern Ulysses tell without a tear.
1197,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now the latter watch of wasting night,"
1198,THE ARGUMENT.,"And setting stars, to kindly rest invite;"
1199,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, since you take such int’rest in our woe,"
1200,THE ARGUMENT.,"And Troy’s disastrous end desire to know,"
1201,THE ARGUMENT.,"I will restrain my tears, and briefly tell"

1203,THE ARGUMENT.,
1204,THE ARGUMENT.,"“By destiny compell’d, and in despair,"
1205,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Greeks grew weary of the tedious war,"

1208,THE ARGUMENT.,The sides were plank’d with pine; they feign’d it made
1209,THE ARGUMENT.,"For their return, and this the vow they paid."
1210,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus they pretend, but in the hollow side"
1211,THE ARGUMENT.,Selected numbers of their soldiers hide:
1212,THE ARGUMENT.,"With inward arms the dire machine they load,"
1213,THE ARGUMENT.,And iron bowels stuff the dark abode.
1214,THE ARGUMENT.,"In sight of Troy lies Tenedos, an isle"
1215,THE ARGUMENT.,(While Fortune did on Priam’s empire smile)
1216,THE ARGUMENT.,"Renown’d for wealth; but, since, a faithless bay,"
1217,THE ARGUMENT.,Where ships expos’d to wind and weather lay.
1218,THE ARGUMENT.,"There was their fleet conceal’d. We thought, for Greece"
1219,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their sails were hoisted, and our fears release."
1220,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojans, coop’d within their walls so long,"
1221,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unbar their gates, and issue in a throng,"
1222,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like swarming bees, and with delight survey"
1223,THE ARGUMENT.,"The camp deserted, where the Grecians lay:"
1224,THE ARGUMENT.,The quarters of the sev’ral chiefs they show’d;
1225,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here Phoenix, here Achilles, made abode;"
1226,THE ARGUMENT.,Here join’d the battles; there the navy rode.
1227,THE ARGUMENT.,Part on the pile their wond’ring eyes employ:
1228,THE ARGUMENT.,The pile by Pallas rais’d to ruin Troy.
1229,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thymoetes first (’tis doubtful whether hir’d,"
1230,THE ARGUMENT.,Or so the Trojan destiny requir’d)
1231,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mov’d that the ramparts might be broken down,"
1232,THE ARGUMENT.,To lodge the monster fabric in the town.
1233,THE ARGUMENT.,"But Capys, and the rest of sounder mind,"
1234,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fatal present to the flames designed,"
1235,THE ARGUMENT.,Or to the wat’ry deep; at least to bore
1236,THE ARGUMENT.,"The hollow sides, and hidden frauds explore."
1237,THE ARGUMENT.,"The giddy vulgar, as their fancies guide,"
1238,THE ARGUMENT.,"With noise say nothing, and in parts divide."
1239,THE ARGUMENT.,"Laocoon, follow’d by a num’rous crowd,"
1240,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ran from the fort, and cried, from far, aloud:"
1241,THE ARGUMENT.,‘O wretched countrymen! what fury reigns?
1242,THE ARGUMENT.,What more than madness has possess’d your brains?
1243,THE ARGUMENT.,Think you the Grecians from your coasts are gone?
1244,THE ARGUMENT.,And are Ulysses’ arts no better known?
1245,THE ARGUMENT.,"This hollow fabric either must inclose,"
1246,THE ARGUMENT.,"Within its blind recess, our secret foes;"
1247,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or ’tis an engine rais’d above the town,"
1248,THE ARGUMENT.,"T’ o’erlook the walls, and then to batter down."
1249,THE ARGUMENT.,"Somewhat is sure design’d, by fraud or force:"
1250,THE ARGUMENT.,"Trust not their presents, nor admit the horse.’"
1251,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus having said, against the steed he threw"
1252,THE ARGUMENT.,"His forceful spear, which, hissing as it flew,"
1253,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pierc’d thro’ the yielding planks of jointed wood,"
1254,THE ARGUMENT.,And trembling in the hollow belly stood.
1255,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sides, transpierc’d, return a rattling sound,"
1256,THE ARGUMENT.,And groans of Greeks inclos’d come issuing thro’ the wound
1257,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, had not Heav’n the fall of Troy design’d,"
1258,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or had not men been fated to be blind,"
1259,THE ARGUMENT.,Enough was said and done t’inspire a better mind.
1260,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then had our lances pierc’d the treach’rous wood,"
1261,THE ARGUMENT.,And Ilian tow’rs and Priam’s empire stood.
1262,THE ARGUMENT.,"Meantime, with shouts, the Trojan shepherds bring"
1263,THE ARGUMENT.,"A captive Greek, in bands, before the king;"
1264,THE ARGUMENT.,"Taken to take; who made himself their prey,"
1265,THE ARGUMENT.,"T’ impose on their belief, and Troy betray;"
1266,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fix’d on his aim, and obstinately bent"
1267,THE ARGUMENT.,"To die undaunted, or to circumvent."
1268,THE ARGUMENT.,"About the captive, tides of Trojans flow;"
1269,THE ARGUMENT.,"All press to see, and some insult the foe."
1270,THE ARGUMENT.,Now hear how well the Greeks their wiles disguis’d;
1271,THE ARGUMENT.,Behold a nation in a man compris’d.
1272,THE ARGUMENT.,"Trembling the miscreant stood, unarm’d and bound;"
1273,THE ARGUMENT.,"He star’d, and roll’d his haggard eyes around,"
1274,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then said: ‘Alas! what earth remains, what sea"
1275,THE ARGUMENT.,Is open to receive unhappy me?
1276,THE ARGUMENT.,"What fate a wretched fugitive attends,"
1277,THE ARGUMENT.,"Scorn’d by my foes, abandon’d by my friends?’"
1278,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said, and sigh’d, and cast a rueful eye:"
1279,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our pity kindles, and our passions die."
1280,THE ARGUMENT.,"We cheer the youth to make his own defence,"
1281,THE ARGUMENT.,"And freely tell us what he was, and whence:"
1282,THE ARGUMENT.,"What news he could impart, we long to know,"
1283,THE ARGUMENT.,And what to credit from a captive foe.
1284,THE ARGUMENT.,
1285,THE ARGUMENT.,"“His fear at length dismiss’d, he said: ‘Whate’er"
1286,THE ARGUMENT.,"My fate ordains, my words shall be sincere:"
1287,THE ARGUMENT.,I neither can nor dare my birth disclaim;
1288,THE ARGUMENT.,"Greece is my country, Sinon is my name."
1289,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tho’ plung’d by Fortune’s pow’r in misery,"
1290,THE ARGUMENT.,’Tis not in Fortune’s pow’r to make me lie.
1291,THE ARGUMENT.,If any chance has hither brought the name
1292,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of Palamedes, not unknown to fame,"
1293,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who suffer’d from the malice of the times,"
1294,THE ARGUMENT.,"Accus’d and sentenc’d for pretended crimes,"
1295,THE ARGUMENT.,Because these fatal wars he would prevent;
1296,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose death the wretched Greeks too late lament;
1297,THE ARGUMENT.,"Me, then a boy, my father, poor and bare"
1298,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of other means, committed to his care,"
1299,THE ARGUMENT.,His kinsman and companion in the war.
1300,THE ARGUMENT.,"While Fortune favour’d, while his arms support"
1301,THE ARGUMENT.,"The cause, and rul’d the counsels, of the court,"
1302,THE ARGUMENT.,I made some figure there; nor was my name
1303,THE ARGUMENT.,"Obscure, nor I without my share of fame."
1304,THE ARGUMENT.,"But when Ulysses, with fallacious arts,"
1305,THE ARGUMENT.,"Had made impression in the people’s hearts,"
1306,THE ARGUMENT.,And forg’d a treason in my patron’s name
1307,THE ARGUMENT.,"(I speak of things too far divulg’d by fame),"
1308,THE ARGUMENT.,"My kinsman fell. Then I, without support,"
1309,THE ARGUMENT.,"In private mourn’d his loss, and left the court."
1310,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mad as I was, I could not bear his fate"
1311,THE ARGUMENT.,"With silent grief, but loudly blam’d the state,"
1312,THE ARGUMENT.,And curs’d the direful author of my woes.
1313,THE ARGUMENT.,’Twas told again; and hence my ruin rose.
1314,THE ARGUMENT.,"I threaten’d, if indulgent Heav’n once more"
1315,THE ARGUMENT.,"Would land me safely on my native shore,"
1316,THE ARGUMENT.,His death with double vengeance to restore.
1317,THE ARGUMENT.,This mov’d the murderer’s hate; and soon ensued
1318,THE ARGUMENT.,Th’ effects of malice from a man so proud.
1319,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ambiguous rumours thro’ the camp he spread,"
1320,THE ARGUMENT.,"And sought, by treason, my devoted head;"
1321,THE ARGUMENT.,"New crimes invented; left unturn’d no stone,"
1322,THE ARGUMENT.,"To make my guilt appear, and hide his own;"
1323,THE ARGUMENT.,Till Calchas was by force and threat’ning wrought:
1324,THE ARGUMENT.,But why—why dwell I on that anxious thought?
1325,THE ARGUMENT.,"If on my nation just revenge you seek,"
1326,THE ARGUMENT.,"And ’tis t’ appear a foe, t’ appear a Greek;"
1327,THE ARGUMENT.,Already you my name and country know;
1328,THE ARGUMENT.,"Assuage your thirst of blood, and strike the blow:"
1329,THE ARGUMENT.,"My death will both the kingly brothers please,"
1330,THE ARGUMENT.,And set insatiate Ithacus at ease.’
1331,THE ARGUMENT.,"This fair unfinish’d tale, these broken starts,"
1332,THE ARGUMENT.,Rais’d expectations in our longing hearts:
1333,THE ARGUMENT.,Unknowing as we were in Grecian arts.
1334,THE ARGUMENT.,"His former trembling once again renew’d,"
1335,THE ARGUMENT.,"With acted fear, the villain thus pursued:"
1336,THE ARGUMENT.,
1337,THE ARGUMENT.,"“‘Long had the Grecians (tir’d with fruitless care,"
1338,THE ARGUMENT.,And wearied with an unsuccessful war)
1339,THE ARGUMENT.,"Resolv’d to raise the siege, and leave the town;"
1340,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, had the gods permitted, they had gone;"
1341,THE ARGUMENT.,But oft the wintry seas and southern winds
1342,THE ARGUMENT.,"Withstood their passage home, and chang’d their minds."
1343,THE ARGUMENT.,Portents and prodigies their souls amaz’d;
1344,THE ARGUMENT.,"But most, when this stupendous pile was rais’d:"
1345,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then flaming meteors, hung in air, were seen,"
1346,THE ARGUMENT.,And thunders rattled thro’ a sky serene.
1347,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dismay’d, and fearful of some dire event,"
1348,THE ARGUMENT.,Eurypylus t’ enquire their fate was sent.
1349,THE ARGUMENT.,He from the gods this dreadful answer brought:
1350,THE ARGUMENT.,
1351,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O Grecians, when the Trojan shores you sought,"
1352,THE ARGUMENT.,Your passage with a virgin’s blood was bought:
1353,THE ARGUMENT.,"So must your safe return be bought again,"
1354,THE ARGUMENT.,And Grecian blood once more atone the main.”
1355,THE ARGUMENT.,The spreading rumour round the people ran;
1356,THE ARGUMENT.,"All fear’d, and each believ’d himself the man."
1357,THE ARGUMENT.,Ulysses took th’ advantage of their fright;
1358,THE ARGUMENT.,"Call’d Calchas, and produc’d in open sight:"
1359,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then bade him name the wretch, ordain’d by fate"
1360,THE ARGUMENT.,"The public victim, to redeem the state."
1361,THE ARGUMENT.,"Already some presag’d the dire event,"
1362,THE ARGUMENT.,And saw what sacrifice Ulysses meant.
1363,THE ARGUMENT.,For twice five days the good old seer withstood
1364,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ intended treason, and was dumb to blood,"
1365,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till, tir’d, with endless clamours and pursuit"
1366,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of Ithacus, he stood no longer mute;"
1367,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, as it was agreed, pronounc’d that I"
1368,THE ARGUMENT.,Was destin’d by the wrathful gods to die.
1369,THE ARGUMENT.,"All prais’d the sentence, pleas’d the storm should fall"
1370,THE ARGUMENT.,"On one alone, whose fury threaten’d all."
1371,THE ARGUMENT.,The dismal day was come; the priests prepare
1372,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their leaven’d cakes, and fillets for my hair."
1373,THE ARGUMENT.,"I follow’d nature’s laws, and must avow"
1374,THE ARGUMENT.,I broke my bonds and fled the fatal blow.
1375,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hid in a weedy lake all night I lay,"
1376,THE ARGUMENT.,Secure of safety when they sail’d away.
1377,THE ARGUMENT.,"But now what further hopes for me remain,"
1378,THE ARGUMENT.,"To see my friends, or native soil, again;"
1379,THE ARGUMENT.,"My tender infants, or my careful sire,"
1380,THE ARGUMENT.,Whom they returning will to death require;
1381,THE ARGUMENT.,"Will perpetrate on them their first design,"
1382,THE ARGUMENT.,And take the forfeit of their heads for mine?
1383,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which, O! if pity mortal minds can move,"
1384,THE ARGUMENT.,"If there be faith below, or gods above,"
1385,THE ARGUMENT.,"If innocence and truth can claim desert,"
1386,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ye Trojans, from an injur’d wretch avert.’"
1387,THE ARGUMENT.,
1388,THE ARGUMENT.,“False tears true pity move; the king commands
1389,THE ARGUMENT.,"To loose his fetters, and unbind his hands:"
1390,THE ARGUMENT.,Then adds these friendly words: ‘Dismiss thy fears;
1391,THE ARGUMENT.,Forget the Greeks; be mine as thou wert theirs.
1392,THE ARGUMENT.,"But truly tell, was it for force or guile,"
1393,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or some religious end, you rais’d the pile?’"
1394,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus said the king. He, full of fraudful arts,"
1395,THE ARGUMENT.,This well-invented tale for truth imparts:
1396,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘Ye lamps of heav’n!’ he said, and lifted high"
1397,THE ARGUMENT.,"His hands now free, ‘thou venerable sky!"
1398,THE ARGUMENT.,"Inviolable pow’rs, ador’d with dread!"
1399,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ye fatal fillets, that once bound this head!"
1400,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ye sacred altars, from whose flames I fled!"
1401,THE ARGUMENT.,"Be all of you adjur’d; and grant I may,"
1402,THE ARGUMENT.,"Without a crime, th’ ungrateful Greeks betray,"
1403,THE ARGUMENT.,"Reveal the secrets of the guilty state,"
1404,THE ARGUMENT.,And justly punish whom I justly hate!
1405,THE ARGUMENT.,"But you, O king, preserve the faith you gave,"
1406,THE ARGUMENT.,"If I, to save myself, your empire save."
1407,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Grecian hopes, and all th’ attempts they made,"
1408,THE ARGUMENT.,Were only founded on Minerva’s aid.
1409,THE ARGUMENT.,"But from the time when impious Diomede,"
1410,THE ARGUMENT.,"And false Ulysses, that inventive head,"
1411,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her fatal image from the temple drew,"
1412,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sleeping guardians of the castle slew,"
1413,THE ARGUMENT.,Her virgin statue with their bloody hands
1414,THE ARGUMENT.,"Polluted, and profan’d her holy bands;"
1415,THE ARGUMENT.,"From thence the tide of fortune left their shore,"
1416,THE ARGUMENT.,And ebb’d much faster than it flow’d before:
1417,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their courage languish’d, as their hopes decay’d;"
1418,THE ARGUMENT.,"And Pallas, now averse, refus’d her aid."
1419,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor did the goddess doubtfully declare
1420,THE ARGUMENT.,Her alter’d mind and alienated care.
1421,THE ARGUMENT.,"When first her fatal image touch’d the ground,"
1422,THE ARGUMENT.,"She sternly cast her glaring eyes around,"
1423,THE ARGUMENT.,"That sparkled as they roll’d, and seem’d to threat:"
1424,THE ARGUMENT.,Her heav’nly limbs distill’d a briny sweat.
1425,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thrice from the ground she leap’d, was seen to wield"
1426,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her brandish’d lance, and shake her horrid shield."
1427,THE ARGUMENT.,Then Calchas bade our host for flight
1428,THE ARGUMENT.,"And hope no conquest from the tedious war,"
1429,THE ARGUMENT.,Till first they sail’d for Greece; with pray’rs besought
1430,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her injur’d pow’r, and better omens brought."
1431,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now their navy plows the wat’ry main,"
1432,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet soon expect it on your shores again,"
1433,THE ARGUMENT.,With Pallas pleas’d; as Calchas did ordain.
1434,THE ARGUMENT.,"But first, to reconcile the blue-ey’d maid"
1435,THE ARGUMENT.,"For her stol’n statue and her tow’r betray’d,"
1436,THE ARGUMENT.,"Warn’d by the seer, to her offended name"
1437,THE ARGUMENT.,"We rais’d and dedicate this wondrous frame,"
1438,THE ARGUMENT.,"So lofty, lest thro’ your forbidden gates"
1439,THE ARGUMENT.,"It pass, and intercept our better fates:"
1440,THE ARGUMENT.,"For, once admitted there, our hopes are lost;"
1441,THE ARGUMENT.,And Troy may then a new Palladium boast;
1442,THE ARGUMENT.,"For so religion and the gods ordain,"
1443,THE ARGUMENT.,"That, if you violate with hands profane"
1444,THE ARGUMENT.,"Minerva’s gift, your town in flames shall burn,"
1445,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Which omen, O ye gods, on Grecia turn!)"
1446,THE ARGUMENT.,"But if it climb, with your assisting hands,"
1447,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojan walls, and in the city stands;"
1448,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Troy shall Argos and Mycenae burn,"
1449,THE ARGUMENT.,And the reverse of fate on us return.’
1450,THE ARGUMENT.,
1451,THE ARGUMENT.,"“With such deceits he gain’d their easy hearts,"
1452,THE ARGUMENT.,Too prone to credit his perfidious arts.
1453,THE ARGUMENT.,"What Diomede, nor Thetis’ greater son,"
1454,THE ARGUMENT.,"A thousand ships, nor ten years’ siege, had done:"
1455,THE ARGUMENT.,False tears and fawning words the city won.
1456,THE ARGUMENT.,
1457,THE ARGUMENT.,"“A greater omen, and of worse portent,"
1458,THE ARGUMENT.,"Did our unwary minds with fear torment,"
1459,THE ARGUMENT.,Concurring to produce the dire event.
1460,THE ARGUMENT.,"Laocoon, Neptune’s priest by lot that year,"
1461,THE ARGUMENT.,With solemn pomp then sacrific’d a steer;
1462,THE ARGUMENT.,"When, dreadful to behold, from sea we spied"
1463,THE ARGUMENT.,"Two serpents, rank’d abreast, the seas divide,"
1464,THE ARGUMENT.,And smoothly sweep along the swelling tide.
1465,THE ARGUMENT.,Their flaming crests above the waves they show;
1466,THE ARGUMENT.,Their bellies seem to burn the seas below;
1467,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their speckled tails advance to steer their course,"
1468,THE ARGUMENT.,And on the sounding shore the flying billows force.
1469,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now the strand, and now the plain they held;"
1470,THE ARGUMENT.,Their ardent eyes with bloody streaks were fill’d;
1471,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their nimble tongues they brandish’d as they came,"
1472,THE ARGUMENT.,"And lick’d their hissing jaws, that sputter’d flame."
1473,THE ARGUMENT.,"We fled amaz’d; their destin’d way they take,"
1474,THE ARGUMENT.,And to Laocoon and his children make;
1475,THE ARGUMENT.,"And first around the tender boys they wind,"
1476,THE ARGUMENT.,Then with their sharpen’d fangs their limbs and bodies grind.
1477,THE ARGUMENT.,"The wretched father, running to their aid"
1478,THE ARGUMENT.,"With pious haste, but vain, they next invade;"
1479,THE ARGUMENT.,Twice round his waist their winding volumes roll’d;
1480,THE ARGUMENT.,And twice about his gasping throat they fold.
1481,THE ARGUMENT.,"The priest thus doubly chok’d, their crests divide,"
1482,THE ARGUMENT.,And tow’ring o’er his head in triumph ride.
1483,THE ARGUMENT.,With both his hands he labours at the knots;
1484,THE ARGUMENT.,His holy fillets the blue venom blots;
1485,THE ARGUMENT.,His roaring fills the flitting air around.
1486,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus, when an ox receives a glancing wound,"
1487,THE ARGUMENT.,"He breaks his bands, the fatal altar flies,"
1488,THE ARGUMENT.,And with loud bellowings breaks the yielding skies.
1489,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their tasks perform’d, the serpents quit their prey,"
1490,THE ARGUMENT.,And to the tow’r of Pallas make their way:
1491,THE ARGUMENT.,"Couch’d at her feet, they lie protected there"
1492,THE ARGUMENT.,By her large buckler and protended spear.
1493,THE ARGUMENT.,Amazement seizes all; the gen’ral cry
1494,THE ARGUMENT.,"Proclaims Laocoon justly doom’d to die,"
1495,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whose hand the will of Pallas had withstood,"
1496,THE ARGUMENT.,And dared to violate the sacred wood.
1497,THE ARGUMENT.,"All vote t’ admit the steed, that vows be paid"
1498,THE ARGUMENT.,And incense offer’d to th’ offended maid.
1499,THE ARGUMENT.,A spacious breach is made; the town lies bare;
1500,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some hoisting levers, some the wheels prepare"
1501,THE ARGUMENT.,And fasten to the horse’s feet; the rest
1502,THE ARGUMENT.,With cables haul along th’ unwieldly beast.
1503,THE ARGUMENT.,Each on his fellow for assistance calls;
1504,THE ARGUMENT.,"At length the fatal fabric mounts the walls,"
1505,THE ARGUMENT.,"Big with destruction. Boys with chaplets crown’d,"
1506,THE ARGUMENT.,"And choirs of virgins, sing and dance around."
1507,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus rais’d aloft, and then descending down,"
1508,THE ARGUMENT.,"It enters o’er our heads, and threats the town."
1509,THE ARGUMENT.,"O sacred city, built by hands divine!"
1510,THE ARGUMENT.,O valiant heroes of the Trojan line!
1511,THE ARGUMENT.,Four times he struck: as oft the clashing sound
1512,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of arms was heard, and inward groans rebound."
1513,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet, mad with zeal, and blinded with our fate,"
1514,THE ARGUMENT.,We haul along the horse in solemn state;
1515,THE ARGUMENT.,Then place the dire portent within the tow’r.
1516,THE ARGUMENT.,"Cassandra cried, and curs’d th’ unhappy hour;"
1517,THE ARGUMENT.,"Foretold our fate; but, by the god’s decree,"
1518,THE ARGUMENT.,"All heard, and none believ’d the prophecy."
1519,THE ARGUMENT.,"With branches we the fanes adorn, and waste,"
1520,THE ARGUMENT.,"In jollity, the day ordain’d to be the last."
1521,THE ARGUMENT.,"Meantime the rapid heav’ns roll’d down the light,"
1522,THE ARGUMENT.,And on the shaded ocean rush’d the night;
1523,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our men, secure, nor guards nor sentries held,"
1524,THE ARGUMENT.,But easy sleep their weary limbs compell’d.
1525,THE ARGUMENT.,The Grecians had embark’d their naval pow’rs
1526,THE ARGUMENT.,"From Tenedos, and sought our well-known shores,"
1527,THE ARGUMENT.,"Safe under covert of the silent night,"
1528,THE ARGUMENT.,And guided by th’ imperial galley’s light;
1529,THE ARGUMENT.,"When Sinon, favour’d by the partial gods,"
1530,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unlock’d the horse, and op’d his dark abodes;"
1531,THE ARGUMENT.,"Restor’d to vital air our hidden foes,"
1532,THE ARGUMENT.,Who joyful from their long confinement rose.
1533,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tysander bold, and Sthenelus their guide,"
1534,THE ARGUMENT.,And dire Ulysses down the cable slide:
1535,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Thoas, Athamas, and Pyrrhus haste;"
1536,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor was the Podalirian hero last,"
1537,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor injur’d Menelaus, nor the fam’d"
1538,THE ARGUMENT.,"Epeus, who the fatal engine fram’d."
1539,THE ARGUMENT.,A nameless crowd succeed; their forces join
1540,THE ARGUMENT.,"T’ invade the town, oppress’d with sleep and wine."
1541,THE ARGUMENT.,Those few they find awake first meet their fate;
1542,THE ARGUMENT.,Then to their fellows they unbar the gate.
1543,THE ARGUMENT.,
1544,THE ARGUMENT.,"“’Twas in the dead of night, when sleep repairs"
1545,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our bodies worn with toils, our minds with cares,"
1546,THE ARGUMENT.,When Hector’s ghost before my sight appears:
1547,THE ARGUMENT.,"A bloody shroud he seem’d, and bath’d in tears;"
1548,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such as he was, when, by Pelides slain,"
1549,THE ARGUMENT.,Thessalian coursers dragg’d him o’er the plain.
1550,THE ARGUMENT.,"Swoln were his feet, as when the thongs were thrust"
1551,THE ARGUMENT.,Thro’ the bor’d holes; his body black with dust;
1552,THE ARGUMENT.,Unlike that Hector who return’d from toils
1553,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of war, triumphant, in Aeacian spoils,"
1554,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or him who made the fainting Greeks retire,"
1555,THE ARGUMENT.,And launch’d against their navy Phrygian fire.
1556,THE ARGUMENT.,His hair and beard stood stiffen’d with his gore;
1557,THE ARGUMENT.,And all the wounds he for his country bore
1558,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now stream’d afresh, and with new purple ran."
1559,THE ARGUMENT.,"I wept to see the visionary man,"
1560,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, while my trance continued, thus began:"
1561,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘O light of Trojans, and support of Troy,"
1562,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy father’s champion, and thy country’s joy!"
1563,THE ARGUMENT.,"O, long expected by thy friends! from whence"
1564,THE ARGUMENT.,Art thou so late return’d for our defence?
1565,THE ARGUMENT.,"Do we behold thee, wearied as we are"
1566,THE ARGUMENT.,"With length of labours, and with toils of war?"
1567,THE ARGUMENT.,After so many fun’rals of thy own
1568,THE ARGUMENT.,Art thou restor’d to thy declining town?
1569,THE ARGUMENT.,"But say, what wounds are these? What new disgrace"
1570,THE ARGUMENT.,Deforms the manly features of thy face?’
1571,THE ARGUMENT.,
1572,THE ARGUMENT.,"“To this the spectre no reply did frame,"
1573,THE ARGUMENT.,"But answer’d to the cause for which he came,"
1574,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, groaning from the bottom of his breast,"
1575,THE ARGUMENT.,This warning in these mournful words express’d:
1576,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘O goddess-born! escape, by timely flight,"
1577,THE ARGUMENT.,The flames and horrors of this fatal night.
1578,THE ARGUMENT.,The foes already have possess’d the wall;
1579,THE ARGUMENT.,"Troy nods from high, and totters to her fall."
1580,THE ARGUMENT.,"Enough is paid to Priam’s royal name,"
1581,THE ARGUMENT.,More than enough to duty and to fame.
1582,THE ARGUMENT.,If by a mortal hand my father’s throne
1583,THE ARGUMENT.,"Could be defended, ’twas by mine alone."
1584,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now Troy to thee commends her future state,"
1585,THE ARGUMENT.,And gives her gods companions of thy fate:
1586,THE ARGUMENT.,"From their assistance walls expect,"
1587,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which, wand’ring long, at last thou shalt erect.’"
1588,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said, and brought me, from their blest abodes,"
1589,THE ARGUMENT.,"The venerable statues of the gods,"
1590,THE ARGUMENT.,"With ancient Vesta from the sacred choir,"
1591,THE ARGUMENT.,The wreaths and relics of th’ immortal fire.
1592,THE ARGUMENT.,
1593,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Now peals of shouts come thund’ring from afar,"
1594,THE ARGUMENT.,"Cries, threats, and loud laments, and mingled war:"
1595,THE ARGUMENT.,"The noise approaches, tho’ our palace stood"
1596,THE ARGUMENT.,"Aloof from streets, encompass’d with a wood."
1597,THE ARGUMENT.,"Louder, and yet more loud, I hear th’ alarms"
1598,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of human cries distinct, and clashing arms."
1599,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fear broke my slumbers; I no longer stay,"
1600,THE ARGUMENT.,"But mount the terrace, thence the town survey,"
1601,THE ARGUMENT.,And hearken what the frightful sounds convey.
1602,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus, when a flood of fire by wind is borne,"
1603,THE ARGUMENT.,"Crackling it rolls, and mows the standing corn;"
1604,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or deluges, descending on the plains,"
1605,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sweep o’er the yellow ear, destroy the pains"
1606,THE ARGUMENT.,Of lab’ring oxen and the peasant’s gains;
1607,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unroot the forest oaks, and bear away"
1608,THE ARGUMENT.,"Flocks, folds, and trees, and undistinguish’d prey:"
1609,THE ARGUMENT.,"The shepherd climbs the cliff, and sees from far"
1610,THE ARGUMENT.,The wasteful ravage of the wat’ry war.
1611,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Hector’s faith was manifestly clear’d,"
1612,THE ARGUMENT.,And Grecian frauds in open light appear’d.
1613,THE ARGUMENT.,The palace of Deiphobus ascends
1614,THE ARGUMENT.,"In smoky flames, and catches on his friends."
1615,THE ARGUMENT.,Ucalegon burns next: the seas are bright
1616,THE ARGUMENT.,"With splendour not their own, and shine with Trojan light."
1617,THE ARGUMENT.,"New clamours and new clangours now arise,"
1618,THE ARGUMENT.,The sound of trumpets mix’d with fighting cries.
1619,THE ARGUMENT.,"With frenzy seiz’d, I run to meet th’ alarms,"
1620,THE ARGUMENT.,"Resolv’d on death, resolv’d to die in arms,"
1621,THE ARGUMENT.,"But first to gather friends, with them t’ oppose"
1622,THE ARGUMENT.,"If fortune favour’d, and repel the foes;"
1623,THE ARGUMENT.,"Spurr’d by my courage, by my country fir’d,"
1624,THE ARGUMENT.,With sense of honour and revenge inspir’d.
1625,THE ARGUMENT.,
1626,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Pantheus, Apollo’s priest, a sacred name,"
1627,THE ARGUMENT.,"Had scap’d the Grecian swords, and pass’d the flame:"
1628,THE ARGUMENT.,"With relics loaden, to my doors he fled,"
1629,THE ARGUMENT.,And by the hand his tender grandson led.
1630,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘What hope, O Pantheus? whither can we run?"
1631,THE ARGUMENT.,Where make a stand? and what may yet be done?’
1632,THE ARGUMENT.,"Scarce had I said, when Pantheus, with a groan:"
1633,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘Troy is no more, and Ilium was a town!"
1634,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fatal day, th’ appointed hour, is come,"
1635,THE ARGUMENT.,When wrathful Jove’s irrevocable doom
1636,THE ARGUMENT.,Transfers the Trojan state to Grecian hands.
1637,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fire consumes the town, the foe commands;"
1638,THE ARGUMENT.,"And armed hosts, an unexpected force,"
1639,THE ARGUMENT.,Break from the bowels of the fatal horse.
1640,THE ARGUMENT.,"Within the gates, proud Sinon throws about"
1641,THE ARGUMENT.,"The flames; and foes for entrance press without,"
1642,THE ARGUMENT.,"With thousand others, whom I fear to name,"
1643,THE ARGUMENT.,More than from Argos or Mycenae came.
1644,THE ARGUMENT.,To sev’ral posts their parties they divide;
1645,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some block the narrow streets, some scour the wide:"
1646,THE ARGUMENT.,"The bold they kill, th’ unwary they surprise;"
1647,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who fights finds death, and death finds him who flies."
1648,THE ARGUMENT.,The warders of the gate but scarce maintain
1649,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ unequal combat, and resist in vain.’"
1650,THE ARGUMENT.,
1651,THE ARGUMENT.,"“I heard; and Heav’n, that well-born souls inspires,"
1652,THE ARGUMENT.,Prompts me thro’ lifted swords and rising fires
1653,THE ARGUMENT.,"To run where clashing arms and clamour calls,"
1654,THE ARGUMENT.,And rush undaunted to defend the walls.
1655,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ripheus and Iph’itas by my side engage,"
1656,THE ARGUMENT.,"For valour one renown’d, and one for age."
1657,THE ARGUMENT.,Dymas and Hypanis by moonlight knew
1658,THE ARGUMENT.,"My motions and my mien, and to my party drew;"
1659,THE ARGUMENT.,"With young Coroebus, who by love was led"
1660,THE ARGUMENT.,"To win renown and fair Cassandra’s bed,"
1661,THE ARGUMENT.,"And lately brought his troops to Priam’s aid,"
1662,THE ARGUMENT.,Forewarn’d in vain by the prophetic maid.
1663,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whom when I saw resolv’d in arms to fall,"
1664,THE ARGUMENT.,And that one spirit animated all:
1665,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘Brave souls!’ said I, ‘but brave, alas! in vain:"
1666,THE ARGUMENT.,"Come, finish what our cruel fates ordain."
1667,THE ARGUMENT.,"You see the desp’rate state of our affairs,"
1668,THE ARGUMENT.,And heav’n’s protecting pow’rs are deaf to pray’rs.
1669,THE ARGUMENT.,The passive gods behold the Greeks defile
1670,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their temples, and abandon to the spoil"
1671,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their own abodes: we, feeble few, conspire"
1672,THE ARGUMENT.,"To save a sinking town, involv’d in fire."
1673,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then let us fall, but fall amidst our foes:"
1674,THE ARGUMENT.,Despair of life the means of living shows.’
1675,THE ARGUMENT.,So bold a speech incourag’d their desire
1676,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of death, and added fuel to their fire."
1677,THE ARGUMENT.,
1678,THE ARGUMENT.,"“As hungry wolves, with raging appetite,"
1679,THE ARGUMENT.,"Scour thro’ the fields, nor fear the stormy night;"
1680,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their whelps at home expect the promis’d food,"
1681,THE ARGUMENT.,And long to temper their dry chaps in blood:
1682,THE ARGUMENT.,"So rush’d we forth at once; resolv’d to die,"
1683,THE ARGUMENT.,"Resolv’d, in death, the last extremes to try."
1684,THE ARGUMENT.,"We leave the narrow lanes behind, and dare"
1685,THE ARGUMENT.,Th’ unequal combat in the public square:
1686,THE ARGUMENT.,Night was our friend; our leader was despair.
1687,THE ARGUMENT.,What tongue can tell the slaughter of that night?
1688,THE ARGUMENT.,What eyes can weep the sorrows and affright?
1689,THE ARGUMENT.,An ancient and imperial city falls:
1690,THE ARGUMENT.,The streets are fill’d with frequent funerals;
1691,THE ARGUMENT.,"Houses and holy temples float in blood,"
1692,THE ARGUMENT.,And hostile nations make a common flood.
1693,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not only Trojans fall; but, in their turn,"
1694,THE ARGUMENT.,"The vanquish’d triumph, and the victors mourn."
1695,THE ARGUMENT.,Ours take new courage from despair and night:
1696,THE ARGUMENT.,"Confus’d the fortune is, confus’d the fight."
1697,THE ARGUMENT.,"All parts resound with tumults, plaints, and fears;"
1698,THE ARGUMENT.,And grisly Death in sundry shapes appears.
1699,THE ARGUMENT.,"Androgeos fell among us, with his band,"
1700,THE ARGUMENT.,Who thought us Grecians newly come to land.
1701,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘From whence,’ said he, ‘my friends, this long delay?"
1702,THE ARGUMENT.,"You loiter, while the spoils are borne away:"
1703,THE ARGUMENT.,Our ships are laden with the Trojan store;
1704,THE ARGUMENT.,"And you, like truants, come too late ashore.’"
1705,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said, but soon corrected his mistake,"
1706,THE ARGUMENT.,"Found, by the doubtful answers which we make:"
1707,THE ARGUMENT.,"Amaz’d, he would have shunn’d th’ unequal fight;"
1708,THE ARGUMENT.,"But we, more num’rous, intercept his flight."
1709,THE ARGUMENT.,"As when some peasant, in a bushy brake,"
1710,THE ARGUMENT.,Has with unwary footing press’d a snake;
1711,THE ARGUMENT.,"He starts aside, astonish’d, when he spies"
1712,THE ARGUMENT.,"His rising crest, blue neck, and rolling eyes;"
1713,THE ARGUMENT.,So from our arms surpris’d Androgeos flies.
1714,THE ARGUMENT.,"In vain; for him and his we compass’d round,"
1715,THE ARGUMENT.,"Possess’d with fear, unknowing of the ground,"
1716,THE ARGUMENT.,And of their lives an easy conquest found.
1717,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus Fortune on our first endeavor smil’d.
1718,THE ARGUMENT.,"Coroebus then, with youthful hopes beguil’d,"
1719,THE ARGUMENT.,"Swoln with success, and a daring mind,"
1720,THE ARGUMENT.,This new invention fatally design’d.
1721,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘My friends,’ said he, ‘since Fortune shows the way,"
1722,THE ARGUMENT.,’Tis fit we should th’ auspicious guide obey.
1723,THE ARGUMENT.,"For what has she these Grecian arms bestow’d,"
1724,THE ARGUMENT.,"But their destruction, and the Trojans’ good?"
1725,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then change we shields, and their devices bear:"
1726,THE ARGUMENT.,Let fraud supply the want of force in war.
1727,THE ARGUMENT.,"They find us arms.’ This said, himself he dress’d"
1728,THE ARGUMENT.,"In dead Androgeos’ spoils, his upper vest,"
1729,THE ARGUMENT.,"His painted buckler, and his plumy crest."
1730,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus Ripheus, Dymas, all the Trojan train,"
1731,THE ARGUMENT.,"Lay down their own attire, and strip the slain."
1732,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mix’d with the Greeks, we go with ill presage,"
1733,THE ARGUMENT.,Flatter’d with hopes to glut our greedy rage;
1734,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unknown, assaulting whom we blindly meet,"
1735,THE ARGUMENT.,And strew with Grecian carcasses the street.
1736,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus while their straggling parties we defeat,"
1737,THE ARGUMENT.,Some to the shore and safer ships retreat;
1738,THE ARGUMENT.,"And some, oppress’d with more ignoble fear,"
1739,THE ARGUMENT.,"Remount the hollow horse, and pant in secret there."
1740,THE ARGUMENT.,
1741,THE ARGUMENT.,"“But, ah! what use of valour can be made,"
1742,THE ARGUMENT.,When heav’n’s propitious pow’rs refuse their aid!
1743,THE ARGUMENT.,"Behold the royal prophetess, the fair"
1744,THE ARGUMENT.,"Cassandra, dragg’d by her dishevel’d hair,"
1745,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whom not Minerva’s shrine, nor sacred bands,"
1746,THE ARGUMENT.,In safety could protect from sacrilegious hands:
1747,THE ARGUMENT.,"On heav’n she cast her eyes, she sigh’d, she cried,"
1748,THE ARGUMENT.,(’Twas all she could) her tender arms were tied.
1749,THE ARGUMENT.,So sad a sight Coroebus could not bear;
1750,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, fir’d with rage, distracted with despair,"
1751,THE ARGUMENT.,Amid the barb’rous ravishers he flew:
1752,THE ARGUMENT.,Our leader’s rash example we pursue.
1753,THE ARGUMENT.,"But storms of stones, from the proud temple’s height,"
1754,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pour down, and on our batter’d helms alight:"
1755,THE ARGUMENT.,"We from our friends receiv’d this fatal blow,"
1756,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who thought us Grecians, as we seem’d in show."
1757,THE ARGUMENT.,"They aim at the mistaken crests, from high;"
1758,THE ARGUMENT.,And ours beneath the pond’rous ruin lie.
1759,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, mov’d with anger and disdain, to see"
1760,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their troops dispers’d, the royal virgin free,"
1761,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Grecians rally, and their pow’rs unite,"
1762,THE ARGUMENT.,"With fury charge us, and renew the fight."
1763,THE ARGUMENT.,"The brother kings with Ajax join their force,"
1764,THE ARGUMENT.,And the whole squadron of Thessalian horse.
1765,THE ARGUMENT.,
1766,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Thus, when the rival winds their quarrel try,"
1767,THE ARGUMENT.,"Contending for the kingdom of the sky,"
1768,THE ARGUMENT.,"South, east, and west, on airy coursers borne;"
1769,THE ARGUMENT.,"The whirlwind gathers, and the woods are torn:"
1770,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Nereus strikes the deep; the billows rise,"
1771,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, mix’d with ooze and sand, pollute the skies."
1772,THE ARGUMENT.,The troops we squander’d first again appear
1773,THE ARGUMENT.,"From several quarters, and enclose the rear."
1774,THE ARGUMENT.,"They first observe, and to the rest betray,"
1775,THE ARGUMENT.,Our diff’rent speech; our borrow’d arms survey.
1776,THE ARGUMENT.,"Oppress’d with odds, we fall; Coroebus first,"
1777,THE ARGUMENT.,"At Pallas’ altar, by Peneleus pierc’d."
1778,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Ripheus follow’d, in th’ unequal fight;"
1779,THE ARGUMENT.,"Just of his word, observant of the right:"
1780,THE ARGUMENT.,"Heav’n thought not so. Dymas their fate attends,"
1781,THE ARGUMENT.,"With Hypanis, mistaken by their friends."
1782,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor, Pantheus, thee, thy mitre, nor the bands"
1783,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of awful Phoebus, sav’d from impious hands."
1784,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ye Trojan flames, your testimony bear,"
1785,THE ARGUMENT.,"What I perform’d, and what I suffer’d there;"
1786,THE ARGUMENT.,"No sword avoiding in the fatal strife,"
1787,THE ARGUMENT.,"Expos’d to death, and prodigal of life;"
1788,THE ARGUMENT.,"Witness, ye heavens! I live not by my fault:"
1789,THE ARGUMENT.,I strove to have deserv’d the death I sought.
1790,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, when I could not fight, and would have died,"
1791,THE ARGUMENT.,"Borne off to distance by the growing tide,"
1792,THE ARGUMENT.,"Old Iphitus and I were hurried thence,"
1793,THE ARGUMENT.,"With Pelias wounded, and without defence."
1794,THE ARGUMENT.,New clamours from th’ invested palace ring:
1795,THE ARGUMENT.,"We run to die, or disengage the king."
1796,THE ARGUMENT.,"So hot th’ assault, so high the tumult rose,"
1797,THE ARGUMENT.,"While ours defend, and while the Greeks oppose"
1798,THE ARGUMENT.,As all the Dardan and Argolic race
1799,THE ARGUMENT.,Had been contracted in that narrow space;
1800,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or as all Ilium else were void of fear,"
1801,THE ARGUMENT.,"And tumult, war, and slaughter, only there."
1802,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their targets in a tortoise cast, the foes,"
1803,THE ARGUMENT.,"Secure advancing, to the turrets rose:"
1804,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some mount the scaling ladders; some, more bold,"
1805,THE ARGUMENT.,"Swerve upwards, and by posts and pillars hold;"
1806,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their left hand gripes their bucklers in th’ ascent,"
1807,THE ARGUMENT.,While with their right they seize the battlement.
1808,THE ARGUMENT.,From their demolish’d tow’rs the Trojans throw
1809,THE ARGUMENT.,"Huge heaps of stones, that, falling, crush the foe;"
1810,THE ARGUMENT.,And heavy beams and rafters from the sides
1811,THE ARGUMENT.,(Such arms their last necessity provides)
1812,THE ARGUMENT.,"And gilded roofs, come tumbling from on high,"
1813,THE ARGUMENT.,The marks of state and ancient royalty.
1814,THE ARGUMENT.,"The guards below, fix’d in the pass, attend"
1815,THE ARGUMENT.,"The charge undaunted, and the gate defend."
1816,THE ARGUMENT.,"Renew’d in courage with recover’d breath,"
1817,THE ARGUMENT.,"A second time we ran to tempt our death,"
1818,THE ARGUMENT.,"To clear the palace from the foe, succeed"
1819,THE ARGUMENT.,"The weary living, and revenge the dead."
1820,THE ARGUMENT.,
1821,THE ARGUMENT.,"“A postern door, yet unobserv’d and free,"
1822,THE ARGUMENT.,"Join’d by the length of a blind gallery,"
1823,THE ARGUMENT.,To the king’s closet led: a way well known
1824,THE ARGUMENT.,"To Hector’s wife, while Priam held the throne,"
1825,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thro’ which she brought Astyanax, unseen,"
1826,THE ARGUMENT.,To cheer his grandsire and his grandsire’s queen.
1827,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thro’ this we pass, and mount the tow’r, from whence"
1828,THE ARGUMENT.,With unavailing arms the Trojans make defence.
1829,THE ARGUMENT.,From this the trembling king had oft descried
1830,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Grecian camp, and saw their navy ride."
1831,THE ARGUMENT.,"Beams from its lofty height with swords we hew,"
1832,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, wrenching with our hands, th’ assault renew;"
1833,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, where the rafters on the columns meet,"
1834,THE ARGUMENT.,We push them headlong with our arms and feet.
1835,THE ARGUMENT.,"The lightning flies not swifter than the fall,"
1836,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor thunder louder than the ruin’d wall:
1837,THE ARGUMENT.,Down goes the top at once; the Greeks beneath
1838,THE ARGUMENT.,"Are piecemeal torn, or pounded into death."
1839,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet more succeed, and more to death are sent;"
1840,THE ARGUMENT.,"We cease not from above, nor they below relent."
1841,THE ARGUMENT.,"Before the gate stood Pyrrhus, threat’ning loud,"
1842,THE ARGUMENT.,With glitt’ring arms conspicuous in the crowd.
1843,THE ARGUMENT.,"So shines, renew’d in youth, the crested snake,"
1844,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who slept the winter in a thorny brake,"
1845,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, casting off his slough when spring returns,"
1846,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now looks aloft, and with new glory burns;"
1847,THE ARGUMENT.,"Restor’d with poisonous herbs, his ardent sides"
1848,THE ARGUMENT.,Reflect the sun; and rais’d on spires he rides;
1849,THE ARGUMENT.,"High o’er the grass, hissing he rolls along,"
1850,THE ARGUMENT.,And brandishes by fits his forky tongue.
1851,THE ARGUMENT.,"Proud Periphas, and fierce Automedon,"
1852,THE ARGUMENT.,"His father’s charioteer, together run"
1853,THE ARGUMENT.,To force the gate; the Scyrian infantry
1854,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rush on in crowds, and the barr’d passage free."
1855,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ent’ring the court, with shouts the skies they rend;"
1856,THE ARGUMENT.,And flaming firebrands to the roofs ascend.
1857,THE ARGUMENT.,"Himself, among the foremost, deals his blows,"
1858,THE ARGUMENT.,And with his ax repeated strokes bestows
1859,THE ARGUMENT.,"On the strong doors; then all their shoulders ply,"
1860,THE ARGUMENT.,Till from the posts the brazen hinges fly.
1861,THE ARGUMENT.,He hews apace; the double bars at length
1862,THE ARGUMENT.,Yield to his ax and unresisted strength.
1863,THE ARGUMENT.,A mighty breach is made: the rooms conceal’d
1864,THE ARGUMENT.,"Appear, and all the palace is reveal’d;"
1865,THE ARGUMENT.,"The halls of audience, and of public state,"
1866,THE ARGUMENT.,And where the lonely queen in secret sate.
1867,THE ARGUMENT.,"Arm’d soldiers now by trembling maids are seen,"
1868,THE ARGUMENT.,"With not a door, and scarce a space, between."
1869,THE ARGUMENT.,"The house is fill’d with loud laments and cries,"
1870,THE ARGUMENT.,And shrieks of women rend the vaulted skies;
1871,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fearful matrons run from place to place,"
1872,THE ARGUMENT.,"And kiss the thresholds, and the posts embrace."
1873,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fatal work inhuman Pyrrhus plies,"
1874,THE ARGUMENT.,And all his father sparkles in his eyes;
1875,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor bars, nor fighting guards, his force sustain:"
1876,THE ARGUMENT.,"The bars are broken, and the guards are slain."
1877,THE ARGUMENT.,"In rush the Greeks, and all the apartments fill;"
1878,THE ARGUMENT.,"Those few defendants whom they find, they kill."
1879,THE ARGUMENT.,Not with so fierce a rage the foaming flood
1880,THE ARGUMENT.,"Roars, when he finds his rapid course withstood;"
1881,THE ARGUMENT.,"Bears down the dams with unresisted sway,"
1882,THE ARGUMENT.,And sweeps the cattle and the cots away.
1883,THE ARGUMENT.,These eyes beheld him when he march’d between
1884,THE ARGUMENT.,"The brother kings: I saw th’ unhappy queen,"
1885,THE ARGUMENT.,"The hundred wives, and where old Priam stood,"
1886,THE ARGUMENT.,To stain his hallow’d altar with his brood.
1887,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fifty nuptial beds (such hopes had he,"
1888,THE ARGUMENT.,"So large a promise, of a progeny),"
1889,THE ARGUMENT.,"The posts, of plated gold, and hung with spoils,"
1890,THE ARGUMENT.,Fell the reward of the proud victor’s toils.
1891,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where’er the raging fire had left a space,"
1892,THE ARGUMENT.,The Grecians enter and possess the place.
1893,THE ARGUMENT.,
1894,THE ARGUMENT.,“Perhaps you may of Priam’s fate enquire.
1895,THE ARGUMENT.,"He, when he saw his regal town on fire,"
1896,THE ARGUMENT.,"His ruin’d palace, and his ent’ring foes,"
1897,THE ARGUMENT.,"On ev’ry side inevitable woes,"
1898,THE ARGUMENT.,"In arms, disus’d, invests his limbs, decay’d,"
1899,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like them, with age; a late and useless aid."
1900,THE ARGUMENT.,His feeble shoulders scarce the weight sustain;
1901,THE ARGUMENT.,"Loaded, not arm’d, he creeps along with pain,"
1902,THE ARGUMENT.,"Despairing of success, ambitious to be slain!"
1903,THE ARGUMENT.,"Uncover’d but by heav’n, there stood in view"
1904,THE ARGUMENT.,"An altar; near the hearth a laurel grew,"
1905,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dodder’d with age, whose boughs encompass round"
1906,THE ARGUMENT.,"The household gods, and shade the holy ground."
1907,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here Hecuba, with all her helpless train"
1908,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of dames, for shelter sought, but sought in vain."
1909,THE ARGUMENT.,"Driv’n like a flock of doves along the sky,"
1910,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their images they hug, and to their altars fly."
1911,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Queen, when she beheld her trembling lord,"
1912,THE ARGUMENT.,"And hanging by his side a heavy sword,"
1913,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘What rage,’ she cried, ‘has seiz’d my husband’s mind?"
1914,THE ARGUMENT.,"What arms are these, and to what use design’d?"
1915,THE ARGUMENT.,"These times want other aids! Were Hector here,"
1916,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ev’n Hector now in vain, like Priam, would appear."
1917,THE ARGUMENT.,"With us, one common shelter thou shalt find,"
1918,THE ARGUMENT.,Or in one common fate with us be join’d.’
1919,THE ARGUMENT.,"She said, and with a last salute embrac’d"
1920,THE ARGUMENT.,"The poor old man, and by the laurel plac’d."
1921,THE ARGUMENT.,"Behold! Polites, one of Priam’s sons,"
1922,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pursued by Pyrrhus, there for safety runs."
1923,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thro’ swords and foes, amaz’d and hurt, he flies"
1924,THE ARGUMENT.,Thro’ empty courts and open galleries.
1925,THE ARGUMENT.,"Him Pyrrhus, urging with his lance, pursues,"
1926,THE ARGUMENT.,"And often reaches, and his thrusts renews."
1927,THE ARGUMENT.,"The youth, transfix’d, with lamentable cries,"
1928,THE ARGUMENT.,Expires before his wretched parent’s eyes:
1929,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whom gasping at his feet when Priam saw,"
1930,THE ARGUMENT.,The fear of death gave place to nature’s law;
1931,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, shaking more with anger than with age,"
1932,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘The gods,’ said he, ‘requite thy brutal rage!"
1933,THE ARGUMENT.,"As sure they will, barbarian, sure they must,"
1934,THE ARGUMENT.,"If there be gods in heav’n, and gods be just:"
1935,THE ARGUMENT.,Who tak’st in wrongs an insolent delight;
1936,THE ARGUMENT.,With a son’s death t’ infect a father’s sight.
1937,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not he, whom thou and lying fame conspire"
1938,THE ARGUMENT.,"To call thee his; not he, thy vaunted sire,"
1939,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus us’d my wretched age: the gods he fear’d,"
1940,THE ARGUMENT.,The laws of nature and of nations heard.
1941,THE ARGUMENT.,"He cheer’d my sorrows, and, for sums of gold,"
1942,THE ARGUMENT.,The bloodless carcass of my Hector sold;
1943,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pitied the woes a parent underwent,"
1944,THE ARGUMENT.,And sent me back in safety from his tent.’
1945,THE ARGUMENT.,
1946,THE ARGUMENT.,"“This said, his feeble hand a javelin threw,"
1947,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which, flutt’ring, seem’d to loiter as it flew:"
1948,THE ARGUMENT.,"Just, and but barely, to the mark it held,"
1949,THE ARGUMENT.,And faintly tinkled on the brazen shield.
1950,THE ARGUMENT.,
1951,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Then Pyrrhus thus: ‘Go thou from me to fate,"
1952,THE ARGUMENT.,And to my father my foul deeds relate.
1953,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now die!’ With that he dragg’d the trembling sire,"
1954,THE ARGUMENT.,"Slidd’ring thro’ clotter’d blood and holy mire,"
1955,THE ARGUMENT.,"(The mingled paste his murder’d son had made,)"
1956,THE ARGUMENT.,"Haul’d from beneath the violated shade,"
1957,THE ARGUMENT.,And on the sacred pile the royal victim laid.
1958,THE ARGUMENT.,"His right hand held his bloody falchion bare,"
1959,THE ARGUMENT.,His left he twisted in his hoary hair;
1960,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, with a speeding thrust, his heart he found:"
1961,THE ARGUMENT.,"The lukewarm blood came rushing thro’ the wound,"
1962,THE ARGUMENT.,And sanguine streams distain’d the sacred ground.
1963,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus Priam fell, and shar’d one common fate"
1964,THE ARGUMENT.,"With Troy in ashes, and his ruin’d state:"
1965,THE ARGUMENT.,"He, who the scepter of all Asia sway’d,"
1966,THE ARGUMENT.,Whom monarchs like domestic slaves obey’d.

1973,THE ARGUMENT.,Lest equal years might equal fortune find.
1974,THE ARGUMENT.,"Again I thought on my forsaken wife,"
1975,THE ARGUMENT.,And trembled for my son’s abandon’d life.
1976,THE ARGUMENT.,"I look’d about, but found myself alone,"
1977,THE ARGUMENT.,Deserted at my need! My friends were gone.
1978,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some spent with toil, some with despair oppress’d,"
1979,THE ARGUMENT.,Leap’d headlong from the heights; the flames consum’d the rest.
1980,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus, wand’ring in my way, without a guide,"
1981,THE ARGUMENT.,The graceless Helen in the porch I spied
1982,THE ARGUMENT.,Of Vesta’s temple; there she lurk’d alone;
1983,THE ARGUMENT.,"Muffled she sate, and, what she could, unknown:"
1984,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, by the flames that cast their blaze around,"
1985,THE ARGUMENT.,That common bane of Greece and Troy I found.
1986,THE ARGUMENT.,"For Ilium burnt, she dreads the Trojan sword;"
1987,THE ARGUMENT.,More dreads the vengeance of her injur’d lord;
1988,THE ARGUMENT.,Ev’n by those gods who refug’d her abhorr’d.
1989,THE ARGUMENT.,"Trembling with rage, the strumpet I regard,"
1990,THE ARGUMENT.,Resolv’d to give her guilt the due reward:
1991,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘Shall she triumphant sail before the wind,"
1992,THE ARGUMENT.,And leave in flames unhappy Troy behind?
1993,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shall she her kingdom and her friends review,"
1994,THE ARGUMENT.,"In state attended with a captive crew,"
1995,THE ARGUMENT.,"While unreveng’d the good old Priam falls,"
1996,THE ARGUMENT.,And Grecian fires consume the Trojan walls?
1997,THE ARGUMENT.,For this the Phrygian fields and Xanthian flood
1998,THE ARGUMENT.,"Were swell’d with bodies, and were drunk with blood?"
1999,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Tis true, a soldier can small honour gain,"
2000,THE ARGUMENT.,"And boast no conquest, from a woman slain:"
2001,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet shall the fact not pass without applause,"
2002,THE ARGUMENT.,Of vengeance taken in so just a cause;
2003,THE ARGUMENT.,"The punish’d crime shall set my soul at ease,"
2004,THE ARGUMENT.,And murm’ring manes of my friends appease.’
2005,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus while I rave, a gleam of pleasing light"
2006,THE ARGUMENT.,"Spread o’er the place; and, shining heav’nly bright,"
2007,THE ARGUMENT.,My mother stood reveal’d before my sight
2008,THE ARGUMENT.,Never so radiant did her eyes appear;
2009,THE ARGUMENT.,Not her own star confess’d a light so clear:
2010,THE ARGUMENT.,"Great in her charms, as when on gods above"
2011,THE ARGUMENT.,"She looks, and breathes herself into their love."
2012,THE ARGUMENT.,"She held my hand, the destin’d blow to break;"
2013,THE ARGUMENT.,Then from her rosy lips began to speak:
2014,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘My son, from whence this madness, this neglect"
2015,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of my commands, and those whom I protect?"
2016,THE ARGUMENT.,Why this unmanly rage? Recall to mind
2017,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whom you forsake, what pledges leave behind."
2018,THE ARGUMENT.,"Look if your helpless father yet survive,"
2019,THE ARGUMENT.,Or if Ascanius or Creusa live.
2020,THE ARGUMENT.,Around your house the greedy Grecians err;
2021,THE ARGUMENT.,"And these had perish’d in the nightly war,"
2022,THE ARGUMENT.,But for my presence and protecting care.
2023,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not Helen’s face, nor Paris, was in fault;"
2024,THE ARGUMENT.,But by the gods was this destruction brought.
2025,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now cast your eyes around, while I dissolve"
2026,THE ARGUMENT.,"The mists and films that mortal eyes involve,"
2027,THE ARGUMENT.,"Purge from your sight the dross, and make you see"
2028,THE ARGUMENT.,The shape of each avenging deity.
2029,THE ARGUMENT.,"Enlighten’d thus, my just commands fulfil,"
2030,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor fear obedience to your mother’s will.
2031,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where yon disorder’d heap of ruin lies,"
2032,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stones rent from stones; where clouds of dust arise,"
2033,THE ARGUMENT.,"Amid that smother Neptune holds his place,"
2034,THE ARGUMENT.,"Below the wall’s foundation drives his mace,"
2035,THE ARGUMENT.,And heaves the building from the solid base.
2036,THE ARGUMENT.,"Look where, in arms, imperial Juno stands"
2037,THE ARGUMENT.,"Full in the Scaean gate, with loud commands,"
2038,THE ARGUMENT.,Urging on shore the tardy Grecian bands.
2039,THE ARGUMENT.,"See! Pallas, of her snaky buckler proud,"
2040,THE ARGUMENT.,"Bestrides the tow’r, refulgent thro’ the cloud:"
2041,THE ARGUMENT.,"See! Jove new courage to the foe supplies,"
2042,THE ARGUMENT.,And arms against the town the partial deities.
2043,THE ARGUMENT.,"Haste hence, my son; this fruitless labour end:"
2044,THE ARGUMENT.,"Haste, where your trembling spouse and sire attend:"
2045,THE ARGUMENT.,Haste; and a mother’s care your passage shall befriend.’
2046,THE ARGUMENT.,"She said, and swiftly vanish’d from my sight,"
2047,THE ARGUMENT.,Obscure in clouds and gloomy shades of night.
2048,THE ARGUMENT.,"I look’d, I listen’d; dreadful sounds I hear;"
2049,THE ARGUMENT.,And the dire forms of hostile gods appear.
2050,THE ARGUMENT.,"Troy sunk in flames I saw, nor could prevent;"
2051,THE ARGUMENT.,And Ilium from its old foundations rent;
2052,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rent like a mountain ash, which dar’d the winds,"
2053,THE ARGUMENT.,And stood the sturdy strokes of lab’ring hinds.
2054,THE ARGUMENT.,About the roots the cruel ax resounds;
2055,THE ARGUMENT.,The stumps are pierc’d with oft-repeated wounds:
2056,THE ARGUMENT.,The war is felt on high; the nodding crown
2057,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now threats a fall, and throws the leafy honours down."
2058,THE ARGUMENT.,"To their united force it yields, tho’ late,"
2059,THE ARGUMENT.,And mourns with mortal groans th’ approaching fate:
2060,THE ARGUMENT.,The roots no more their upper load sustain;
2061,THE ARGUMENT.,"But down she falls, and spreads a ruin thro’ the plain."
2062,THE ARGUMENT.,
2063,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Descending thence, I scape thro’ foes and fire:"
2064,THE ARGUMENT.,"Before the goddess, foes and flames retire."
2065,THE ARGUMENT.,"Arriv’d at home, he, for whose only sake,"
2066,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or most for his, such toils I undertake,"
2067,THE ARGUMENT.,"The good Anchises, whom, by timely flight,"
2068,THE ARGUMENT.,"I purpos’d to secure on Ida’s height,"
2069,THE ARGUMENT.,"Refus’d the journey, resolute to die"
2070,THE ARGUMENT.,"And add his fun’rals to the fate of Troy,"
2071,THE ARGUMENT.,Rather than exile and old age sustain.
2072,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘Go you, whose blood runs warm in ev’ry vein."
2073,THE ARGUMENT.,"Had Heav’n decreed that I should life enjoy,"
2074,THE ARGUMENT.,Heav’n had decreed to save unhappy Troy.
2075,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Tis, sure, enough, if not too much, for one,"
2076,THE ARGUMENT.,Twice to have seen our Ilium overthrown.
2077,THE ARGUMENT.,"Make haste to save the poor remaining crew,"
2078,THE ARGUMENT.,And give this useless corpse a long adieu.
2079,THE ARGUMENT.,These weak old hands suffice to stop my breath;
2080,THE ARGUMENT.,"At least the pitying foes will aid my death,"
2081,THE ARGUMENT.,"To take my spoils, and leave my body bare:"
2082,THE ARGUMENT.,"As for my sepulcher, let Heav’n take care."
2083,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Tis long since I, for my celestial wife"
2084,THE ARGUMENT.,"Loath’d by the gods, have dragg’d a ling’ring life;"
2085,THE ARGUMENT.,"Since ev’ry hour and moment I expire,"
2086,THE ARGUMENT.,Blasted from heav’n by Jove’s avenging fire.’
2087,THE ARGUMENT.,"This oft repeated, he stood fix’d to die:"
2088,THE ARGUMENT.,"Myself, my wife, my son, my family,"
2089,THE ARGUMENT.,"Intreat, pray, beg, and raise a doleful cry."
2090,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘What, will he still persist, on death resolve,"
2091,THE ARGUMENT.,And in his ruin all his house involve!’
2092,THE ARGUMENT.,He still persists his reasons to maintain;
2093,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our pray’rs, our tears, our loud laments, are vain."
2094,THE ARGUMENT.,
2095,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Urg’d by despair, again I go to try"
2096,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fate of arms, resolv’d in fight to die:"
2097,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘What hope remains, but what my death must give?"
2098,THE ARGUMENT.,"Can I, without so dear a father, live?"
2099,THE ARGUMENT.,"You term it prudence, what I baseness call:"
2100,THE ARGUMENT.,Could such a word from such a parent fall?
2101,THE ARGUMENT.,"If Fortune please, and so the gods ordain,"
2102,THE ARGUMENT.,"That nothing should of ruin’d Troy remain,"
2103,THE ARGUMENT.,"And you conspire with Fortune to be slain,"
2104,THE ARGUMENT.,"The way to death is wide, th’ approaches near:"
2105,THE ARGUMENT.,"For soon relentless Pyrrhus will appear,"
2106,THE ARGUMENT.,Reeking with Priam’s blood: the wretch who slew
2107,THE ARGUMENT.,"The son (inhuman) in the father’s view,"
2108,THE ARGUMENT.,And then the sire himself to the dire altar drew.
2109,THE ARGUMENT.,"O goddess mother, give me back to Fate;"
2110,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your gift was undesir’d, and came too late!"
2111,THE ARGUMENT.,"Did you, for this, unhappy me convey"
2112,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thro’ foes and fires, to see my house a prey?"
2113,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shall I my father, wife, and son behold,"
2114,THE ARGUMENT.,"Welt’ring in blood, each other’s arms infold?"
2115,THE ARGUMENT.,"Haste! gird my sword, tho’ spent and overcome:"
2116,THE ARGUMENT.,’Tis the last summons to receive our doom.
2117,THE ARGUMENT.,"I hear thee, Fate; and I obey thy call!"
2118,THE ARGUMENT.,Not unreveng’d the foe shall see my fall.
2119,THE ARGUMENT.,Restore me to the yet unfinish’d fight:
2120,THE ARGUMENT.,My death is wanting to conclude the night.’
2121,THE ARGUMENT.,"Arm’d once again, my glitt’ring sword I wield,"
2122,THE ARGUMENT.,"While th’ other hand sustains my weighty shield,"
2123,THE ARGUMENT.,And forth I rush to seek th’ abandon’d field.
2124,THE ARGUMENT.,"I went; but sad Creusa stopp’d my way,"
2125,THE ARGUMENT.,"And cross the threshold in my passage lay,"
2126,THE ARGUMENT.,"Embrac’d my knees, and, when I would have gone,"
2127,THE ARGUMENT.,Shew’d me my feeble sire and tender son:
2128,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘If death be your design, at least,’ said she,"
2129,THE ARGUMENT.,‘Take us along to share your destiny.
2130,THE ARGUMENT.,"If any farther hopes in arms remain,"
2131,THE ARGUMENT.,"This place, these pledges of your love, maintain."
2132,THE ARGUMENT.,"To whom do you expose your father’s life,"
2133,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your son’s, and mine, your now forgotten wife!’"
2134,THE ARGUMENT.,"While thus she fills the house with clam’rous cries,"
2135,THE ARGUMENT.,Our hearing is diverted by our eyes:
2136,THE ARGUMENT.,"For, while I held my son, in the short space"
2137,THE ARGUMENT.,Betwixt our kisses and our last embrace;
2138,THE ARGUMENT.,"Strange to relate, from young Iulus’ head"
2139,THE ARGUMENT.,"A lambent flame arose, which gently spread"
2140,THE ARGUMENT.,"Around his brows, and on his temples fed."
2141,THE ARGUMENT.,"Amaz’d, with running water we prepare"
2142,THE ARGUMENT.,"To quench the sacred fire, and slake his hair;"
2143,THE ARGUMENT.,"But old Anchises, vers’d in omens, rear’d"
2144,THE ARGUMENT.,"His hands to heav’n, and this request preferr’d:"
2145,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘If any vows, almighty Jove, can bend"
2146,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy will; if piety can pray’rs commend,"
2147,THE ARGUMENT.,Confirm the glad presage which thou art pleas’d to send.’
2148,THE ARGUMENT.,"Scarce had he said, when, on our left, we hear"
2149,THE ARGUMENT.,A peal of rattling thunder roll in air:
2150,THE ARGUMENT.,"There shot a streaming lamp along the sky,"
2151,THE ARGUMENT.,Which on the winged lightning seem’d to fly;
2152,THE ARGUMENT.,"From o’er the roof the blaze began to move,"
2153,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, trailing, vanish’d in th’ Idaean grove."
2154,THE ARGUMENT.,"It swept a path in heav’n, and shone a guide,"
2155,THE ARGUMENT.,Then in a steaming stench of sulphur died.
2156,THE ARGUMENT.,
2157,THE ARGUMENT.,“The good old man with suppliant hands implor’d
2158,THE ARGUMENT.,"The gods’ protection, and their star ador’d."
2159,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘Now, now,’ said he, ‘my son, no more delay!"
2160,THE ARGUMENT.,"I yield, I follow where Heav’n shews the way."
2161,THE ARGUMENT.,"Keep, O my country gods, our dwelling place,"
2162,THE ARGUMENT.,"And guard this relic of the Trojan race,"
2163,THE ARGUMENT.,"This tender child! These omens are your own,"
2164,THE ARGUMENT.,And you can yet restore the ruin’d town.
2165,THE ARGUMENT.,At least accomplish what your signs foreshow:
2166,THE ARGUMENT.,"I stand resign’d, and am prepar’d to go.’"
2167,THE ARGUMENT.,
2168,THE ARGUMENT.,“He said. The crackling flames appear on high.
2169,THE ARGUMENT.,And driving sparkles dance along the sky.
2170,THE ARGUMENT.,"With Vulcan’s rage the rising winds conspire,"
2171,THE ARGUMENT.,And near our palace roll the flood of fire.
2172,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘Haste, my dear father, (’tis no time to wait,)"
2173,THE ARGUMENT.,And load my shoulders with a willing freight.
2174,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whate’er befalls, your life shall be my care;"
2175,THE ARGUMENT.,"One death, or one deliv’rance, we will share."
2176,THE ARGUMENT.,"My hand shall lead our little son; and you,"
2177,THE ARGUMENT.,"My faithful consort, shall our steps pursue."
2178,THE ARGUMENT.,"Next, you, my servants, heed my strict commands:"
2179,THE ARGUMENT.,"Without the walls a ruin’d temple stands,"
2180,THE ARGUMENT.,To Ceres hallow’d once; a cypress nigh
2181,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shoots up her venerable head on high,"
2182,THE ARGUMENT.,"By long religion kept; there bend your feet,"
2183,THE ARGUMENT.,And in divided parties let us meet.
2184,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our country gods, the relics, and the bands,"
2185,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hold you, my father, in your guiltless hands:"
2186,THE ARGUMENT.,"In me ’tis impious holy things to bear,"
2187,THE ARGUMENT.,"Red as I am with slaughter, new from war,"
2188,THE ARGUMENT.,Till in some living stream I cleanse the guilt
2189,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of dire debate, and blood in battle spilt.’"
2190,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus, ord’ring all that prudence could provide,"
2191,THE ARGUMENT.,I clothe my shoulders with a lion’s hide
2192,THE ARGUMENT.,"And yellow spoils; then, on my bending back,"
2193,THE ARGUMENT.,The welcome load of my dear father take;
2194,THE ARGUMENT.,"While on my better hand Ascanius hung,"
2195,THE ARGUMENT.,And with unequal paces tripp’d along.
2196,THE ARGUMENT.,Creusa kept behind; by choice we stray
2197,THE ARGUMENT.,Thro’ ev’ry dark and ev’ry devious way.
2198,THE ARGUMENT.,"I, who so bold and dauntless just before,"
2199,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Grecian darts and shock of lances bore,"
2200,THE ARGUMENT.,"At ev’ry shadow now am seiz’d with fear,"
2201,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not for myself, but for the charge I bear;"
2202,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till, near the ruin’d gate arriv’d at last,"
2203,THE ARGUMENT.,"Secure, and deeming all the danger past,"
2204,THE ARGUMENT.,A frightful noise of trampling feet we hear.
2205,THE ARGUMENT.,"My father, looking thro’ the shades, with fear,"
2206,THE ARGUMENT.,"Cried out: ‘Haste, haste, my son, the foes are nigh;"
2207,THE ARGUMENT.,Their swords and shining armour I descry.’
2208,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some hostile god, for some unknown offence,"
2209,THE ARGUMENT.,Had sure bereft my mind of better sense;
2210,THE ARGUMENT.,"For, while thro’ winding ways I took my flight,"
2211,THE ARGUMENT.,"And sought the shelter of the gloomy night,"
2212,THE ARGUMENT.,Alas! I lost Creusa: hard to tell
2213,THE ARGUMENT.,"If by her fatal destiny she fell,"
2214,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or weary sate, or wander’d with affright;"
2215,THE ARGUMENT.,But she was lost for ever to my sight.
2216,THE ARGUMENT.,"I knew not, or reflected, till I meet"
2217,THE ARGUMENT.,"My friends, at Ceres’ now deserted seat."
2218,THE ARGUMENT.,We met: not one was wanting; only she
2219,THE ARGUMENT.,"Deceiv’d her friends, her son, and wretched me."
2220,THE ARGUMENT.,
2221,THE ARGUMENT.,“What mad expressions did my tongue refuse!
2222,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whom did I not, of gods or men, accuse!"
2223,THE ARGUMENT.,"This was the fatal blow, that pain’d me more"
2224,THE ARGUMENT.,Than all I felt from ruin’d Troy before.
2225,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stung with my loss, and raving with despair,"
2226,THE ARGUMENT.,"Abandoning my now forgotten care,"
2227,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of counsel, comfort, and of hope bereft,"
2228,THE ARGUMENT.,"My sire, my son, my country gods I left."
2229,THE ARGUMENT.,In shining armour once again I sheathe
2230,THE ARGUMENT.,"My limbs, not feeling wounds, nor fearing death."
2231,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then headlong to the burning walls I run,"
2232,THE ARGUMENT.,And seek the danger I was forc’d to shun.
2233,THE ARGUMENT.,I tread my former tracks; thro’ night explore
2234,THE ARGUMENT.,"Each passage, ev’ry street I cross’d before."
2235,THE ARGUMENT.,"All things were full of horror and affright,"
2236,THE ARGUMENT.,And dreadful ev’n the silence of the night.
2237,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then to my father’s house I make repair,"
2238,THE ARGUMENT.,With some small glimpse of hope to find her there.
2239,THE ARGUMENT.,"Instead of her, the cruel Greeks I met;"
2240,THE ARGUMENT.,"The house was fill’d with foes, with flames beset."
2241,THE ARGUMENT.,"Driv’n on the wings of winds, whole sheets of fire,"
2242,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thro’ air transported, to the roofs aspire."
2243,THE ARGUMENT.,"From thence to Priam’s palace I resort,"
2244,THE ARGUMENT.,And search the citadel and desert court.
2245,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, unobserv’d, I pass by Juno’s church:"
2246,THE ARGUMENT.,A guard of Grecians had possess’d the porch;
2247,THE ARGUMENT.,"There Phoenix and Ulysses watch the prey,"
2248,THE ARGUMENT.,And thither all the wealth of Troy convey:
2249,THE ARGUMENT.,"The spoils which they from ransack’d houses brought,"
2250,THE ARGUMENT.,"And golden bowls from burning altars caught,"
2251,THE ARGUMENT.,"The tables of the gods, the purple vests,"
2252,THE ARGUMENT.,"The people’s treasure, and the pomp of priests."
2253,THE ARGUMENT.,"A rank of wretched youths, with pinion’d hands,"
2254,THE ARGUMENT.,"And captive matrons, in long order stands."
2255,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, with ungovern’d madness, I proclaim,"
2256,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thro’ all the silent street, Creusa’s name:"
2257,THE ARGUMENT.,"Creusa still I call; at length she hears,"
2258,THE ARGUMENT.,And sudden thro’ the shades of night appears.
2259,THE ARGUMENT.,"Appears, no more Creusa, nor my wife,"
2260,THE ARGUMENT.,"But a pale spectre, larger than the life."
2261,THE ARGUMENT.,"Aghast, astonish’d, and struck dumb with fear,"
2262,THE ARGUMENT.,I stood; like bristles rose my stiffen’d hair.
2263,THE ARGUMENT.,Then thus the ghost began to soothe my grief
2264,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘Nor tears, nor cries, can give the dead relief."
2265,THE ARGUMENT.,"Desist, my much-lov’d lord, t’ indulge your pain;"
2266,THE ARGUMENT.,You bear no more than what the gods ordain.
2267,THE ARGUMENT.,My fates permit me not from hence to fly;
2268,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor he, the great controller of the sky."
2269,THE ARGUMENT.,Long wand’ring ways for you the pow’rs decree;
2270,THE ARGUMENT.,"On land hard labours, and a length of sea."
2271,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, after many painful years are past,"
2272,THE ARGUMENT.,"On Latium’s happy shore you shall be cast,"
2273,THE ARGUMENT.,Where gentle Tiber from his bed beholds
2274,THE ARGUMENT.,"The flow’ry meadows, and the feeding folds."
2275,THE ARGUMENT.,There end your toils; and there your fates provide
2276,THE ARGUMENT.,"A quiet kingdom, and a royal bride:"
2277,THE ARGUMENT.,"There fortune shall the Trojan line restore,"
2278,THE ARGUMENT.,And you for lost Creusa weep no more.
2279,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fear not that I shall watch, with servile shame,"
2280,THE ARGUMENT.,Th’ imperious looks of some proud Grecian dame;
2281,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or, stooping to the victor’s lust, disgrace"
2282,THE ARGUMENT.,"My goddess mother, or my royal race."
2283,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now, farewell! The parent of the gods"
2284,THE ARGUMENT.,Restrains my fleeting soul in her abodes:
2285,THE ARGUMENT.,I trust our common issue to your care.’
2286,THE ARGUMENT.,"She said, and gliding pass’d unseen in air."
2287,THE ARGUMENT.,I strove to speak: but horror tied my tongue;
2288,THE ARGUMENT.,"And thrice about her neck my arms I flung,"
2289,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, thrice deceiv’d, on vain embraces hung."
2290,THE ARGUMENT.,"Light as an empty dream at break of day,"
2291,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or as a blast of wind, she rush’d away."
2292,THE ARGUMENT.,
2293,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Thus having pass’d the night in fruitless pain,"
2294,THE ARGUMENT.,"I to my longing friends return again,"
2295,THE ARGUMENT.,"Amaz’d th’ augmented number to behold,"
2296,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of men and matrons mix’d, of young and old;"
2297,THE ARGUMENT.,"A wretched exil’d crew together brought,"
2298,THE ARGUMENT.,"With arms appointed, and with treasure fraught,"

2301,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Morn began, from Ida, to display"
2302,THE ARGUMENT.,Her rosy cheeks; and Phosphor led the day:
2303,THE ARGUMENT.,"Before the gates the Grecians took their post,"
2304,THE ARGUMENT.,And all pretence of late relief was lost.
2305,THE ARGUMENT.,"I yield to Fate, unwillingly retire,"

2330,THE ARGUMENT.,"When ruin’d Troy became the Grecians’ prey,"
2331,THE ARGUMENT.,And Ilium’s lofty tow’rs in ashes lay;
2332,THE ARGUMENT.,"Warn’d by celestial omens, we retreat,"
2333,THE ARGUMENT.,To seek in foreign lands a happier seat.
2334,THE ARGUMENT.,"Near old Antandros, and at Ida’s foot,"
2335,THE ARGUMENT.,"The timber of the sacred groves we cut,"
2336,THE ARGUMENT.,And build our fleet; uncertain yet to find
2337,THE ARGUMENT.,What place the gods for our repose assign’d.
2338,THE ARGUMENT.,Friends daily flock; and scarce the kindly spring
2339,THE ARGUMENT.,"Began to clothe the ground, and birds to sing,"
2340,THE ARGUMENT.,When old Anchises summon’d all to sea:
2341,THE ARGUMENT.,The crew my father and the Fates obey.
2342,THE ARGUMENT.,"With sighs and tears I leave my native shore,"
2343,THE ARGUMENT.,"And empty fields, where Ilium stood before."
2344,THE ARGUMENT.,"My sire, my son, our less and greater gods,"
2345,THE ARGUMENT.,"All sail at once, and cleave the briny floods."
2346,THE ARGUMENT.,
2347,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Against our coast appears a spacious land,"
2348,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which once the fierce Lycurgus did command,"
2349,THE ARGUMENT.,Thracia the name; the people bold in war;
2350,THE ARGUMENT.,"Vast are their fields, and tillage is their care,"
2351,THE ARGUMENT.,"A hospitable realm while Fate was kind,"
2352,THE ARGUMENT.,With Troy in friendship and religion join’d.
2353,THE ARGUMENT.,"I land; with luckless omens, then adore"
2354,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their gods, and draw a line along the shore;"
2355,THE ARGUMENT.,"I lay the deep foundations of a wall,"
2356,THE ARGUMENT.,"And Aenos, nam’d from me, the city call."
2357,THE ARGUMENT.,"To Dionaean Venus vows are paid,"
2358,THE ARGUMENT.,And all the pow’rs that rising labours aid;
2359,THE ARGUMENT.,A bull on Jove’s imperial altar laid.
2360,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not far, a rising hillock stood in view;"
2361,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sharp myrtles on the sides, and cornels grew."
2362,THE ARGUMENT.,"There, while I went to crop the sylvan scenes,"
2363,THE ARGUMENT.,"And shade our altar with their leafy greens,"
2364,THE ARGUMENT.,I pull’d a plant; with horror I relate
2365,THE ARGUMENT.,A prodigy so strange and full of fate.
2366,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rooted fibers rose, and from the wound"
2367,THE ARGUMENT.,Black bloody drops distill’d upon the ground.
2368,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mute and amaz’d, my hair with terror stood;"
2369,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fear shrunk my sinews, and congeal’d my blood."
2370,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mann’d once again, another plant I try:"
2371,THE ARGUMENT.,That other gush’d with the same sanguine dye.
2372,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, fearing guilt for some offence unknown,"
2373,THE ARGUMENT.,"With pray’rs and vows the Dryads I atone,"
2374,THE ARGUMENT.,"With all the sisters of the woods, and most"
2375,THE ARGUMENT.,"The God of Arms, who rules the Thracian coast,"
2376,THE ARGUMENT.,"That they, or he, these omens would avert,"
2377,THE ARGUMENT.,"Release our fears, and better signs impart."
2378,THE ARGUMENT.,"Clear’d, as I thought, and fully fix’d at length"
2379,THE ARGUMENT.,"To learn the cause, I tugged with all my strength:"
2380,THE ARGUMENT.,I bent my knees against the ground; once more
2381,THE ARGUMENT.,The violated myrtle ran with gore.
2382,THE ARGUMENT.,Scarce dare I tell the sequel: from the womb
2383,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of wounded earth, and caverns of the tomb,"
2384,THE ARGUMENT.,"A groan, as of a troubled ghost, renew’d"
2385,THE ARGUMENT.,"My fright, and then these dreadful words ensued:"
2386,THE ARGUMENT.,‘Why dost thou thus my buried body rend?
2387,THE ARGUMENT.,O spare the corpse of thy unhappy friend!
2388,THE ARGUMENT.,Spare to pollute thy pious hands with blood:
2389,THE ARGUMENT.,The tears distil not from the wounded wood;
2390,THE ARGUMENT.,But ev’ry drop this living tree contains
2391,THE ARGUMENT.,"Is kindred blood, and ran in Trojan veins."
2392,THE ARGUMENT.,"O fly from this unhospitable shore,"
2393,THE ARGUMENT.,Warn’d by my fate; for I am Polydore!
2394,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here loads of lances, in my blood embrued,"
2395,THE ARGUMENT.,"Again shoot upward, by my blood renew’d.’"
2396,THE ARGUMENT.,
2397,THE ARGUMENT.,“My falt’ring tongue and shiv’ring limbs declare
2398,THE ARGUMENT.,"My horror, and in bristles rose my hair."
2399,THE ARGUMENT.,"When Troy with Grecian arms was closely pent,"
2400,THE ARGUMENT.,"Old Priam, fearful of the war’s event,"
2401,THE ARGUMENT.,This hapless Polydore to Thracia sent:
2402,THE ARGUMENT.,"Loaded with gold, he sent his darling, far"
2403,THE ARGUMENT.,"From noise and tumults, and destructive war,"
2404,THE ARGUMENT.,Committed to the faithless tyrant’s care;
2405,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who, when he saw the pow’r of Troy decline,"
2406,THE ARGUMENT.,"Forsook the weaker, with the strong to join;"
2407,THE ARGUMENT.,"Broke ev’ry bond of nature and of truth,"
2408,THE ARGUMENT.,"And murder’d, for his wealth, the royal youth."
2409,THE ARGUMENT.,O sacred hunger of pernicious gold!
2410,THE ARGUMENT.,What bands of faith can impious lucre hold?
2411,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, when my soul had shaken off her fears,"
2412,THE ARGUMENT.,I call my father and the Trojan peers;
2413,THE ARGUMENT.,"Relate the prodigies of Heav’n, require"
2414,THE ARGUMENT.,"What he commands, and their advice desire."
2415,THE ARGUMENT.,"All vote to leave that execrable shore,"
2416,THE ARGUMENT.,Polluted with the blood of Polydore;
2417,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, ere we sail, his fun’ral rites prepare,"
2418,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, to his ghost, a tomb and altars rear."
2419,THE ARGUMENT.,"In mournful pomp the matrons walk the round,"
2420,THE ARGUMENT.,"With baleful cypress and blue fillets crown’d,"
2421,THE ARGUMENT.,"With eyes dejected, and with hair unbound."
2422,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then bowls of tepid milk and blood we pour,"
2423,THE ARGUMENT.,And thrice invoke the soul of Polydore.
2424,THE ARGUMENT.,
2425,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Now, when the raging storms no longer reign,"
2426,THE ARGUMENT.,"But southern gales invite us to the main,"
2427,THE ARGUMENT.,"We launch our vessels, with a prosp’rous wind,"
2428,THE ARGUMENT.,And leave the cities and the shores behind.
2429,THE ARGUMENT.,
2430,THE ARGUMENT.,“An island in th’ Aegaean main appears;
2431,THE ARGUMENT.,Neptune and wat’ry Doris claim it theirs.
2432,THE ARGUMENT.,"It floated once, till Phoebus fix’d the sides"
2433,THE ARGUMENT.,"To rooted earth, and now it braves the tides."
2434,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here, borne by friendly winds, we come ashore,"
2435,THE ARGUMENT.,"With needful ease our weary limbs restore,"
2436,THE ARGUMENT.,And the Sun’s temple and his town adore.
2437,THE ARGUMENT.,
2438,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Anius, the priest and king, with laurel crown’d,"
2439,THE ARGUMENT.,"His hoary locks with purple fillets bound,"
2440,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who saw my sire the Delian shore ascend,"
2441,THE ARGUMENT.,Came forth with eager haste to meet his friend;
2442,THE ARGUMENT.,"Invites him to his palace; and, in sign"
2443,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of ancient love, their plighted hands they join."
2444,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then to the temple of the god I went,"
2445,THE ARGUMENT.,"And thus, before the shrine, my vows present:"
2446,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘Give, O Thymbraeus, give a resting place"
2447,THE ARGUMENT.,To the sad relics of the Trojan race;
2448,THE ARGUMENT.,"A seat secure, a region of their own,"
2449,THE ARGUMENT.,"A lasting empire, and a happier town."
2450,THE ARGUMENT.,Where shall we fix? where shall our labours end?
2451,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whom shall we follow, and what fate attend?"
2452,THE ARGUMENT.,Let not my pray’rs a doubtful answer find;
2453,THE ARGUMENT.,But in clear auguries unveil thy mind.’
2454,THE ARGUMENT.,"Scarce had I said: he shook the holy ground,"
2455,THE ARGUMENT.,"The laurels, and the lofty hills around;"
2456,THE ARGUMENT.,And from the tripos rush’d a bellowing sound.
2457,THE ARGUMENT.,"Prostrate we fell; confess’d the present god,"
2458,THE ARGUMENT.,Who gave this answer from his dark abode:
2459,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘Undaunted youths, go, seek that mother earth"
2460,THE ARGUMENT.,From which your ancestors derive their birth.
2461,THE ARGUMENT.,"The soil that sent you forth, her ancient race"
2462,THE ARGUMENT.,In her old bosom shall again embrace.
2463,THE ARGUMENT.,"Through the wide world th’ Aeneian house shall reign,"
2464,THE ARGUMENT.,And children’s children shall the crown sustain.’
2465,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus Phoebus did our future fates disclose:
2466,THE ARGUMENT.,"A mighty tumult, mix’d with joy, arose."
2467,THE ARGUMENT.,
2468,THE ARGUMENT.,“All are concern’d to know what place the god
2469,THE ARGUMENT.,"Assign’d, and where determin’d our abode."
2470,THE ARGUMENT.,"My father, long revolving in his mind"
2471,THE ARGUMENT.,"The race and lineage of the Trojan kind,"
2472,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus answer’d their demands: ‘Ye princes, hear"
2473,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your pleasing fortune, and dispel your fear."
2474,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fruitful isle of Crete, well known to fame,"
2475,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sacred of old to Jove’s imperial name,"
2476,THE ARGUMENT.,"In the mid ocean lies, with large command,"
2477,THE ARGUMENT.,And on its plains a hundred cities stand.
2478,THE ARGUMENT.,"Another Ida rises there, and we"
2479,THE ARGUMENT.,From thence derive our Trojan ancestry.
2480,THE ARGUMENT.,"From thence, as ’tis divulg’d by certain fame,"
2481,THE ARGUMENT.,To the Rhoetean shores old Teucrus came;
2482,THE ARGUMENT.,"There fix’d, and there the seat of empire chose,"
2483,THE ARGUMENT.,Ere Ilium and the Trojan tow’rs arose.
2484,THE ARGUMENT.,"In humble vales they built their soft abodes,"
2485,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till Cybele, the mother of the gods,"
2486,THE ARGUMENT.,"With tinkling cymbals charm’d th’ Idaean woods,"
2487,THE ARGUMENT.,"She secret rites and ceremonies taught,"
2488,THE ARGUMENT.,And to the yoke the savage lions brought.
2489,THE ARGUMENT.,"Let us the land which Heav’n appoints, explore;"
2490,THE ARGUMENT.,"Appease the winds, and seek the Gnossian shore."
2491,THE ARGUMENT.,"If Jove assists the passage of our fleet,"
2492,THE ARGUMENT.,The third propitious dawn discovers Crete.’
2493,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus having said, the sacrifices, laid"
2494,THE ARGUMENT.,"On smoking altars, to the gods he paid:"
2495,THE ARGUMENT.,"A bull, to Neptune an oblation due,"
2496,THE ARGUMENT.,Another bull to bright Apollo slew;
2497,THE ARGUMENT.,"A milk-white ewe, the western winds to please,"
2498,THE ARGUMENT.,"And one coal-black, to calm the stormy seas."
2499,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ere this, a flying rumour had been spread"
2500,THE ARGUMENT.,"That fierce Idomeneus from Crete was fled,"
2501,THE ARGUMENT.,Expell’d and exil’d; that the coast was free
2502,THE ARGUMENT.,From foreign or domestic enemy.
2503,THE ARGUMENT.,
2504,THE ARGUMENT.,"“We leave the Delian ports, and put to sea."
2505,THE ARGUMENT.,"By Naxos, fam’d for vintage, make our way;"
2506,THE ARGUMENT.,Then green Donysa pass; and sail in sight
2507,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of Paros’ isle, with marble quarries white."
2508,THE ARGUMENT.,"We pass the scatter’d isles of Cyclades,"
2509,THE ARGUMENT.,"That, scarce distinguish’d, seem to stud the seas."
2510,THE ARGUMENT.,The shouts of sailors double near the shores;
2511,THE ARGUMENT.,"They stretch their canvas, and they ply their oars."
2512,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘All hands aloft! for Crete! for Crete!’ they cry,"
2513,THE ARGUMENT.,And swiftly thro’ the foamy billows fly.
2514,THE ARGUMENT.,"Full on the promis’d land at length we bore,"
2515,THE ARGUMENT.,With joy descending on the Cretan shore.
2516,THE ARGUMENT.,"With eager haste a rising town I frame,"
2517,THE ARGUMENT.,Which from the Trojan Pergamus I name:
2518,THE ARGUMENT.,The name itself was grateful; I exhort
2519,THE ARGUMENT.,"To found their houses, and erect a fort."
2520,THE ARGUMENT.,Our ships are haul’d upon the yellow strand;
2521,THE ARGUMENT.,The youth begin to till the labour’d land;
2522,THE ARGUMENT.,"And I myself new marriages promote,"
2523,THE ARGUMENT.,"Give laws, and dwellings I divide by lot;"
2524,THE ARGUMENT.,"When rising vapours choke the wholesome air,"
2525,THE ARGUMENT.,And blasts of noisome winds corrupt the year;
2526,THE ARGUMENT.,The trees devouring caterpillars burn;
2527,THE ARGUMENT.,"Parch’d was the grass, and blighted was the corn:"
2528,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor ’scape the beasts; for Sirius, from on high,"
2529,THE ARGUMENT.,With pestilential heat infects the sky:
2530,THE ARGUMENT.,"My men, some fall, the rest in fevers fry."
2531,THE ARGUMENT.,Again my father bids me seek the shore
2532,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of sacred Delos, and the god implore,"
2533,THE ARGUMENT.,"To learn what end of woes we might expect,"
2534,THE ARGUMENT.,And to what clime our weary course direct.
2535,THE ARGUMENT.,
2536,THE ARGUMENT.,"“’Twas night, when ev’ry creature, void of cares,"
2537,THE ARGUMENT.,The common gift of balmy slumber shares:
2538,THE ARGUMENT.,"The statues of my gods (for such they seem’d),"
2539,THE ARGUMENT.,"Those gods whom I from flaming Troy redeem’d,"
2540,THE ARGUMENT.,"Before me stood, majestically bright,"
2541,THE ARGUMENT.,Full in the beams of Phoebe’s ent’ring light.
2542,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then thus they spoke, and eas’d my troubled mind:"
2543,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘What from the Delian god thou go’st to find,"
2544,THE ARGUMENT.,"He tells thee here, and sends us to relate."
2545,THE ARGUMENT.,"Those pow’rs are we, companions of thy fate,"
2546,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who from the burning town by thee were brought,"
2547,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy fortune follow’d, and thy safety wrought."
2548,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thro’ seas and lands as we thy steps attend,"
2549,THE ARGUMENT.,So shall our care thy glorious race befriend.
2550,THE ARGUMENT.,"An ample realm for thee thy fates ordain,"
2551,THE ARGUMENT.,A town that o’er the conquer’d world shall reign.
2552,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thou, mighty walls for mighty nations build;"
2553,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor let thy weary mind to labours yield:
2554,THE ARGUMENT.,"But change thy seat; for not the Delian god,"
2555,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor we, have giv’n thee Crete for our abode."
2556,THE ARGUMENT.,"A land there is, Hesperia call’d of old,"
2557,THE ARGUMENT.,"The soil is fruitful, and the natives bold."
2558,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ Oenotrians held it once, by later fame"
2559,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now call’d Italia, from the leader’s name."
2560,THE ARGUMENT.,Jasius there and Dardanus were born;
2561,THE ARGUMENT.,"From thence we came, and thither must return."
2562,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rise, and thy sire with these glad tidings greet."
2563,THE ARGUMENT.,Search Italy; for Jove denies thee Crete.’
2564,THE ARGUMENT.,
2565,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Astonish’d at their voices and their sight,"
2566,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Nor were they dreams, but visions of the night;"
2567,THE ARGUMENT.,"I saw, I knew their faces, and descried,"
2568,THE ARGUMENT.,"In perfect view, their hair with fillets tied;)"
2569,THE ARGUMENT.,I started from my couch; a clammy sweat
2570,THE ARGUMENT.,On all my limbs and shiv’ring body sate.
2571,THE ARGUMENT.,"To heav’n I lift my hands with pious haste,"
2572,THE ARGUMENT.,And sacred incense in the flames I cast.
2573,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus to the gods their perfect honours done,"
2574,THE ARGUMENT.,"More cheerful, to my good old sire I run,"
2575,THE ARGUMENT.,And tell the pleasing news. In little space
2576,THE ARGUMENT.,He found his error of the double race;
2577,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not, as before he deem’d, deriv’d from Crete;"
2578,THE ARGUMENT.,No more deluded by the doubtful seat:
2579,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then said: ‘O son, turmoil’d in Trojan fate!"
2580,THE ARGUMENT.,Such things as these Cassandra did relate.
2581,THE ARGUMENT.,This day revives within my mind what she
2582,THE ARGUMENT.,"Foretold of Troy renew’d in Italy,"
2583,THE ARGUMENT.,And Latian lands; but who could then have thought
2584,THE ARGUMENT.,"That Phrygian gods to Latium should be brought,"
2585,THE ARGUMENT.,Or who believ’d what mad Cassandra taught?
2586,THE ARGUMENT.,Now let us go where Phoebus leads the way.’
2587,THE ARGUMENT.,
2588,THE ARGUMENT.,"“He said; and we with glad consent obey,"
2589,THE ARGUMENT.,"Forsake the seat, and, leaving few behind,"
2590,THE ARGUMENT.,We spread our sails before the willing wind.
2591,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now from the sight of land our galleys move,"
2592,THE ARGUMENT.,With only seas around and skies above;
2593,THE ARGUMENT.,"When o’er our heads descends a burst of rain,"
2594,THE ARGUMENT.,And night with sable clouds involves the main;
2595,THE ARGUMENT.,The ruffling winds the foamy billows raise;
2596,THE ARGUMENT.,The scatter’d fleet is forc’d to sev’ral ways;
2597,THE ARGUMENT.,"The face of heav’n is ravish’d from our eyes,"
2598,THE ARGUMENT.,And in redoubled peals the roaring thunder flies.
2599,THE ARGUMENT.,"Cast from our course, we wander in the dark."
2600,THE ARGUMENT.,"No stars to guide, no point of land to mark."
2601,THE ARGUMENT.,Ev’n Palinurus no distinction found
2602,THE ARGUMENT.,Betwixt the night and day; such darkness reign’d around.
2603,THE ARGUMENT.,"Three starless nights the doubtful navy strays,"
2604,THE ARGUMENT.,"Without distinction, and three sunless days;"
2605,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fourth renews the light, and, from our shrouds,"
2606,THE ARGUMENT.,"We view a rising land, like distant clouds;"
2607,THE ARGUMENT.,"The mountain-tops confirm the pleasing sight,"
2608,THE ARGUMENT.,And curling smoke ascending from their height.
2609,THE ARGUMENT.,The canvas falls; their oars the sailors ply;
2610,THE ARGUMENT.,From the rude strokes the whirling waters fly.
2611,THE ARGUMENT.,"At length I land upon the Strophades,"
2612,THE ARGUMENT.,Safe from the danger of the stormy seas.
2613,THE ARGUMENT.,"Those isles are compass’d by th’ Ionian main,"
2614,THE ARGUMENT.,"The dire abode where the foul Harpies reign,"
2615,THE ARGUMENT.,Forc’d by the winged warriors to repair
2616,THE ARGUMENT.,"To their old homes, and leave their costly fare."
2617,THE ARGUMENT.,Monsters more fierce offended Heav’n ne’er sent
2618,THE ARGUMENT.,"From hell’s abyss, for human punishment:"
2619,THE ARGUMENT.,"With virgin faces, but with wombs obscene,"
2620,THE ARGUMENT.,"Foul paunches, and with ordure still unclean;"
2621,THE ARGUMENT.,"With claws for hands, and looks for ever lean."
2622,THE ARGUMENT.,
2623,THE ARGUMENT.,"“We landed at the port, and soon beheld"
2624,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fat herds of oxen graze the flow’ry field,"
2625,THE ARGUMENT.,And wanton goats without a keeper stray’d.
2626,THE ARGUMENT.,"With weapons we the welcome prey invade,"
2627,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then call the gods for partners of our feast,"
2628,THE ARGUMENT.,"And Jove himself, the chief invited guest."
2629,THE ARGUMENT.,We spread the tables on the greensward ground;
2630,THE ARGUMENT.,"We feed with hunger, and the bowls go round;"
2631,THE ARGUMENT.,"When from the mountain-tops, with hideous cry,"
2632,THE ARGUMENT.,"And clatt’ring wings, the hungry Harpies fly;"
2633,THE ARGUMENT.,"They snatch the meat, defiling all they find,"
2634,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, parting, leave a loathsome stench behind."
2635,THE ARGUMENT.,"Close by a hollow rock, again we sit,"
2636,THE ARGUMENT.,"New dress the dinner, and the beds refit,"
2637,THE ARGUMENT.,"Secure from sight, beneath a pleasing shade,"
2638,THE ARGUMENT.,Where tufted trees a native arbour made.
2639,THE ARGUMENT.,Again the holy fires on altars burn;
2640,THE ARGUMENT.,"And once again the rav’nous birds return,"
2641,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or from the dark recesses where they lie,"
2642,THE ARGUMENT.,Or from another quarter of the sky;
2643,THE ARGUMENT.,"With filthy claws their odious meal repeat,"
2644,THE ARGUMENT.,And mix their loathsome ordures with their meat.
2645,THE ARGUMENT.,"I bid my friends for vengeance then prepare,"
2646,THE ARGUMENT.,And with the hellish nation wage the war.
2647,THE ARGUMENT.,"They, as commanded, for the fight provide,"
2648,THE ARGUMENT.,And in the grass their glitt’ring weapons hide;
2649,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, when along the crooked shore we hear"
2650,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their clatt’ring wings, and saw the foes appear,"
2651,THE ARGUMENT.,"Misenus sounds a charge: we take th’ alarm,"
2652,THE ARGUMENT.,And our strong hands with swords and bucklers arm.
2653,THE ARGUMENT.,In this new kind of combat all employ
2654,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their utmost force, the monsters to destroy."
2655,THE ARGUMENT.,"In vain, the fated skin is proof to wounds;"
2656,THE ARGUMENT.,And from their plumes the shining sword rebounds.
2657,THE ARGUMENT.,"At length rebuff’d, they leave their mangled prey,"
2658,THE ARGUMENT.,And their stretch’d pinions to the skies display.
2659,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet one remain’d, the messenger of Fate:"
2660,THE ARGUMENT.,"High on a craggy cliff Celaeno sate,"
2661,THE ARGUMENT.,And thus her dismal errand did relate:
2662,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘What! not contented with our oxen slain,"
2663,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dare you with Heav’n an impious war maintain,"
2664,THE ARGUMENT.,And drive the Harpies from their native reign?
2665,THE ARGUMENT.,Heed therefore what I say; and keep in mind
2666,THE ARGUMENT.,"What Jove decrees, what Phoebus has design’d,"
2667,THE ARGUMENT.,"And I, the Furies’ queen, from both relate:"
2668,THE ARGUMENT.,"You seek th’ Italian shores, foredoom’d by fate:"
2669,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ Italian shores are granted you to find,"
2670,THE ARGUMENT.,And a safe passage to the port assign’d.
2671,THE ARGUMENT.,"But know, that ere your promis’d walls you build,"
2672,THE ARGUMENT.,My curses shall severely be fulfill’d.
2673,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fierce famine is your lot for this misdeed,"
2674,THE ARGUMENT.,Reduc’d to grind the plates on which you feed.’
2675,THE ARGUMENT.,"She said, and to the neighb’ring forest flew."
2676,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our courage fails us, and our fears renew."
2677,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hopeless to win by war, to pray’rs we fall,"
2678,THE ARGUMENT.,"And on th’ offended Harpies humbly call,"
2679,THE ARGUMENT.,"And whether gods or birds obscene they were,"
2680,THE ARGUMENT.,Our vows for pardon and for peace prefer.
2681,THE ARGUMENT.,"But old Anchises, off’ring sacrifice,"
2682,THE ARGUMENT.,"And lifting up to heav’n his hands and eyes,"
2683,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ador’d the greater gods: ‘Avert,’ said he,"
2684,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘These omens; render vain this prophecy,"
2685,THE ARGUMENT.,And from th’ impending curse a pious people free!’
2686,THE ARGUMENT.,
2687,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Thus having said, he bids us put to sea;"
2688,THE ARGUMENT.,"We loose from shore our haulsers, and obey,"
2689,THE ARGUMENT.,And soon with swelling sails pursue the wat’ry way.
2690,THE ARGUMENT.,"Amidst our course, Zacynthian woods appear;"
2691,THE ARGUMENT.,And next by rocky Neritos we steer:
2692,THE ARGUMENT.,"We fly from Ithaca’s detested shore,"
2693,THE ARGUMENT.,And curse the land which dire Ulysses bore.
2694,THE ARGUMENT.,"At length Leucate’s cloudy top appears,"
2695,THE ARGUMENT.,"And the Sun’s temple, which the sailor fears."
2696,THE ARGUMENT.,"Resolv’d to breathe a while from labour past,"
2697,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our crooked anchors from the prow we cast,"
2698,THE ARGUMENT.,And joyful to the little city haste.
2699,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here, safe beyond our hopes, our vows we pay"
2700,THE ARGUMENT.,"To Jove, the guide and patron of our way."
2701,THE ARGUMENT.,"The customs of our country we pursue,"
2702,THE ARGUMENT.,And Trojan games on Actian shores renew.
2703,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our youth their naked limbs besmear with oil,"
2704,THE ARGUMENT.,And exercise the wrastlers’ noble toil;
2705,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pleas’d to have sail’d so long before the wind,"
2706,THE ARGUMENT.,And left so many Grecian towns behind.
2707,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sun had now fulfill’d his annual course,"
2708,THE ARGUMENT.,And Boreas on the seas display’d his force:
2709,THE ARGUMENT.,I fix’d upon the temple’s lofty door
2710,THE ARGUMENT.,The brazen shield which vanquish’d Abas bore;
2711,THE ARGUMENT.,The verse beneath my name and action speaks:
2712,THE ARGUMENT.,‘These arms Aeneas took from conqu’ring Greeks.’
2713,THE ARGUMENT.,Then I command to weigh; the seamen ply
2714,THE ARGUMENT.,Their sweeping oars; the smoking billows fly.
2715,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sight of high Phaeacia soon we lost,"
2716,THE ARGUMENT.,And skimm’d along Epirus’ rocky coast.
2717,THE ARGUMENT.,
2718,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Then to Chaonia’s port our course we bend,"
2719,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, landed, to Buthrotus’ heights ascend."
2720,THE ARGUMENT.,Here wondrous things were loudly blaz’d fame:
2721,THE ARGUMENT.,"How Helenus reviv’d the Trojan name,"
2722,THE ARGUMENT.,And reign’d in Greece; that Priam’s captive son
2723,THE ARGUMENT.,Succeeded Pyrrhus in his bed and throne;
2724,THE ARGUMENT.,"And fair Andromache, restor’d by fate,"
2725,THE ARGUMENT.,Once more was happy in a Trojan mate.
2726,THE ARGUMENT.,"I leave my galleys riding in the port,"
2727,THE ARGUMENT.,And long to see the new Dardanian court.
2728,THE ARGUMENT.,"By chance, the mournful queen, before the gate,"
2729,THE ARGUMENT.,Then solemniz’d her former husband’s fate.
2730,THE ARGUMENT.,"Green altars, rais’d of turf, with gifts she crown’d,"
2731,THE ARGUMENT.,"And sacred priests in order stand around,"
2732,THE ARGUMENT.,And thrice the name of hapless Hector sound.
2733,THE ARGUMENT.,The grove itself resembles Ida’s wood;
2734,THE ARGUMENT.,And Simois seem’d the well-dissembled flood.
2735,THE ARGUMENT.,But when at nearer distance she beheld
2736,THE ARGUMENT.,"My shining armour and my Trojan shield,"
2737,THE ARGUMENT.,"Astonish’d at the sight, the vital heat"
2738,THE ARGUMENT.,Forsakes her limbs; her veins no longer beat:
2739,THE ARGUMENT.,"She faints, she falls, and scarce recov’ring strength,"
2740,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus, with a falt’ring tongue, she speaks at length:"
2741,THE ARGUMENT.,
2742,THE ARGUMENT.,"“‘Are you alive, O goddess-born?’ she said,"
2743,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘Or if a ghost, then where is Hector’s shade?’"
2744,THE ARGUMENT.,"At this, she cast a loud and frightful cry."
2745,THE ARGUMENT.,With broken words I made this brief reply:
2746,THE ARGUMENT.,‘All of me that remains appears in sight;
2747,THE ARGUMENT.,"I live, if living be to loathe the light."
2748,THE ARGUMENT.,"No phantom; but I drag a wretched life,"
2749,THE ARGUMENT.,My fate resembling that of Hector’s wife.
2750,THE ARGUMENT.,What have you suffer’d since you lost your lord?
2751,THE ARGUMENT.,By what strange blessing are you now restor’d?
2752,THE ARGUMENT.,"Still are you Hector’s? or is Hector fled,"
2753,THE ARGUMENT.,And his remembrance lost in Pyrrhus’ bed?’
2754,THE ARGUMENT.,"With eyes dejected, in a lowly tone,"
2755,THE ARGUMENT.,After a modest pause she thus begun:
2756,THE ARGUMENT.,
2757,THE ARGUMENT.,"“‘O only happy maid of Priam’s race,"
2758,THE ARGUMENT.,Whom death deliver’d from the foes’ embrace!
2759,THE ARGUMENT.,"Commanded on Achilles’ tomb to die,"
2760,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not forc’d, like us, to hard captivity,"
2761,THE ARGUMENT.,Or in a haughty master’s arms to lie.
2762,THE ARGUMENT.,"In Grecian ships unhappy we were borne,"
2763,THE ARGUMENT.,"Endur’d the victor’s lust, sustain’d the scorn:"
2764,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus I submitted to the lawless pride
2765,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of Pyrrhus, more a handmaid than a bride."
2766,THE ARGUMENT.,"Cloy’d with possession, he forsook my bed,"
2767,THE ARGUMENT.,And Helen’s lovely daughter sought to wed;
2768,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then me to Trojan Helenus resign’d,"
2769,THE ARGUMENT.,And his two slaves in equal marriage join’d;
2770,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till young Orestes, pierc’d with deep despair,"
2771,THE ARGUMENT.,"And longing to redeem the promis’d fair,"
2772,THE ARGUMENT.,Before Apollo’s altar slew the ravisher.
2773,THE ARGUMENT.,By Pyrrhus’ death the kingdom we regain’d:
2774,THE ARGUMENT.,At least one half with Helenus remain’d.
2775,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our part, from Chaon, he Chaonia calls,"
2776,THE ARGUMENT.,And names from Pergamus his rising walls.
2777,THE ARGUMENT.,"But you, what fates have landed on our coast?"
2778,THE ARGUMENT.,"What gods have sent you, or what storms have toss’d?"
2779,THE ARGUMENT.,"Does young Ascanius life and health enjoy,"
2780,THE ARGUMENT.,Sav’d from the ruins of unhappy Troy?
2781,THE ARGUMENT.,"O tell me how his mother’s loss he bears,"
2782,THE ARGUMENT.,"What hopes are promis’d from his blooming years,"
2783,THE ARGUMENT.,How much of Hector in his face appears?’
2784,THE ARGUMENT.,"She spoke; and mix’d her speech with mournful cries,"
2785,THE ARGUMENT.,And fruitless tears came trickling from her eyes.
2786,THE ARGUMENT.,
2787,THE ARGUMENT.,"“At length her lord descends upon the plain,"
2788,THE ARGUMENT.,"In pomp, attended with a num’rous train;"
2789,THE ARGUMENT.,"Receives his friends, and to the city leads,"
2790,THE ARGUMENT.,And tears of joy amidst his welcome sheds.
2791,THE ARGUMENT.,"Proceeding on, another Troy I see,"
2792,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or, in less compass, Troy’s epitome."
2793,THE ARGUMENT.,"A riv’let by the name of Xanthus ran,"
2794,THE ARGUMENT.,And I embrace the Scaean gate again.
2795,THE ARGUMENT.,"My friends in porticoes were entertain’d,"
2796,THE ARGUMENT.,And feasts and pleasures thro’ the city reign’d.
2797,THE ARGUMENT.,"The tables fill’d the spacious hall around,"
2798,THE ARGUMENT.,And golden bowls with sparkling wine were crown’d.
2799,THE ARGUMENT.,"Two days we pass’d in mirth, till friendly gales,"
2800,THE ARGUMENT.,Blown from the south supplied our swelling sails.
2801,THE ARGUMENT.,Then to the royal seer I thus began:
2802,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘O thou, who know’st, beyond the reach of man,"
2803,THE ARGUMENT.,"The laws of heav’n, and what the stars decree;"
2804,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whom Phoebus taught unerring prophecy,"
2805,THE ARGUMENT.,"From his own tripod, and his holy tree;"
2806,THE ARGUMENT.,"Skill’d in the wing’d inhabitants of air,"
2807,THE ARGUMENT.,What auspices their notes and flights declare:
2808,THE ARGUMENT.,O say; for all religious rites portend
2809,THE ARGUMENT.,"A happy voyage, and a prosp’rous end;"
2810,THE ARGUMENT.,And ev’ry power and omen of the sky
2811,THE ARGUMENT.,Direct my course for destin’d Italy;
2812,THE ARGUMENT.,"But only dire Celaeno, from the gods,"
2813,THE ARGUMENT.,A dismal famine fatally forebodes:
2814,THE ARGUMENT.,"O say what dangers I am first to shun,"
2815,THE ARGUMENT.,"What toils vanquish, and what course to run.’"
2816,THE ARGUMENT.,
2817,THE ARGUMENT.,“The prophet first with sacrifice adores
2818,THE ARGUMENT.,The greater gods; their pardon then implores;
2819,THE ARGUMENT.,Unbinds the fillet from his holy head;
2820,THE ARGUMENT.,"To Phoebus, next, my trembling steps he led,"
2821,THE ARGUMENT.,Full of religious doubts and awful dread.
2822,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, with his god possess’d, before the shrine,"
2823,THE ARGUMENT.,These words proceeded from his mouth divine:
2824,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘O goddess-born, (for Heav’n’s appointed will,"
2825,THE ARGUMENT.,"With greater auspices of good than ill,"
2826,THE ARGUMENT.,"Foreshows thy voyage, and thy course directs;"
2827,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy fates conspire, and Jove himself protects,)"
2828,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of many things some few I shall explain,"
2829,THE ARGUMENT.,"Teach thee to shun the dangers of the main,"
2830,THE ARGUMENT.,And how at length the promis’d shore to gain.
2831,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rest the fates from Helenus conceal,"
2832,THE ARGUMENT.,And Juno’s angry pow’r forbids to tell.
2833,THE ARGUMENT.,"First, then, that happy shore, that seems so nigh,"
2834,THE ARGUMENT.,Will far from your deluded wishes fly;
2835,THE ARGUMENT.,Long tracts of seas divide your hopes from Italy:
2836,THE ARGUMENT.,"For you must cruise along Sicilian shores,"
2837,THE ARGUMENT.,And stem the currents with your struggling oars;
2838,THE ARGUMENT.,Then round th’ Italian coast your navy steer;
2839,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, after this, to Circe’s island veer;"
2840,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, last, before your new foundations rise,"
2841,THE ARGUMENT.,"Must pass the Stygian lake, and view the nether skies."
2842,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now mark the signs of future ease and rest,"
2843,THE ARGUMENT.,And bear them safely treasur’d in thy breast.
2844,THE ARGUMENT.,"When, in the shady shelter of a wood,"
2845,THE ARGUMENT.,"And near the margin of a gentle flood,"
2846,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thou shalt behold a sow upon the ground,"
2847,THE ARGUMENT.,With thirty sucking young encompass’d round;
2848,THE ARGUMENT.,The dam and offspring white as falling snow:
2849,THE ARGUMENT.,"These on thy city shall their name bestow,"
2850,THE ARGUMENT.,And there shall end thy labours and thy woe.
2851,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor let the threaten’d famine fright thy mind,"
2852,THE ARGUMENT.,"For Phoebus will assist, and Fate the way will find."
2853,THE ARGUMENT.,"Let not thy course to that ill coast be bent,"
2854,THE ARGUMENT.,Which fronts from far th’ Epirian continent:
2855,THE ARGUMENT.,Those parts are all by Grecian foes possess’d;
2856,THE ARGUMENT.,The salvage Locrians here the shores infest;
2857,THE ARGUMENT.,"There fierce Idomeneus his city builds,"
2858,THE ARGUMENT.,And guards with arms the Salentinian fields;
2859,THE ARGUMENT.,"And on the mountain’s brow Petilia stands,"
2860,THE ARGUMENT.,Which Philoctetes with his troops commands.
2861,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ev’n when thy fleet is landed on the shore,"
2862,THE ARGUMENT.,"And priests with holy vows the gods adore,"
2863,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then with a purple veil involve your eyes,"
2864,THE ARGUMENT.,Lest hostile faces blast the sacrifice.
2865,THE ARGUMENT.,"These rites and customs to the rest commend,"
2866,THE ARGUMENT.,That to your pious race they may descend.
2867,THE ARGUMENT.,
2868,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘When, parted hence, the wind, that ready waits"
2869,THE ARGUMENT.,"For Sicily, shall bear you to the straits"
2870,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where proud Pelorus opes a wider way,"
2871,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tack to the larboard, and stand off to sea:"
2872,THE ARGUMENT.,Veer starboard sea and land. Th’ Italian shore
2873,THE ARGUMENT.,"And fair Sicilia’s coast were one, before"
2874,THE ARGUMENT.,An earthquake caus’d the flaw: the roaring tides
2875,THE ARGUMENT.,The passage broke that land from land divides;
2876,THE ARGUMENT.,"And where the lands retir’d, the rushing ocean rides."
2877,THE ARGUMENT.,"Distinguish’d by the straits, on either hand,"
2878,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now rising cities in long order stand,"
2879,THE ARGUMENT.,And fruitful fields: so much can time invade
2880,THE ARGUMENT.,The mould’ring work that beauteous Nature made.
2881,THE ARGUMENT.,"Far on the right, her dogs foul Scylla hides:"
2882,THE ARGUMENT.,"Charybdis roaring on the left presides,"
2883,THE ARGUMENT.,And in her greedy whirlpool sucks the tides;
2884,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then spouts them from below: with fury driv’n,"
2885,THE ARGUMENT.,The waves mount up and wash the face of heav’n.
2886,THE ARGUMENT.,"But Scylla from her den, with open jaws,"
2887,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sinking vessel in her eddy draws,"
2888,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then dashes on the rocks. A human face,"
2889,THE ARGUMENT.,"And virgin bosom, hides her tail’s disgrace:"
2890,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her parts obscene below the waves descend,"
2891,THE ARGUMENT.,"With dogs inclos’d, and in a dolphin end."
2892,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Tis safer, then, to bear aloof to sea,"
2893,THE ARGUMENT.,"And coast Pachynus, tho’ with more delay,"
2894,THE ARGUMENT.,"Than once to view misshapen Scylla near,"
2895,THE ARGUMENT.,And the loud yell of wat’ry wolves to hear.
2896,THE ARGUMENT.,
2897,THE ARGUMENT.,"“‘Besides, if faith to Helenus be due,"
2898,THE ARGUMENT.,"And if prophetic Phoebus tell me true,"
2899,THE ARGUMENT.,"Do not this precept of your friend forget,"
2900,THE ARGUMENT.,Which therefore more than once I must repeat:
2901,THE ARGUMENT.,"Above the rest, great Juno’s name adore;"
2902,THE ARGUMENT.,Pay vows to Juno; Juno’s aid implore.
2903,THE ARGUMENT.,"Let gifts be to the mighty queen design’d,"
2904,THE ARGUMENT.,And mollify with pray’rs her haughty mind.
2905,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus, at the length, your passage shall be free,"
2906,THE ARGUMENT.,And you shall safe descend on Italy.
2907,THE ARGUMENT.,"Arriv’d at Cumae, when you view the flood"
2908,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of black Avernus, and the sounding wood,"
2909,THE ARGUMENT.,"The mad prophetic Sibyl you shall find,"
2910,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dark in a cave, and on a rock reclin’d."
2911,THE ARGUMENT.,"She sings the fates, and, in her frantic fits,"
2912,THE ARGUMENT.,"The notes and names, inscrib’d, to leafs commits."
2913,THE ARGUMENT.,"What she commits to leafs, in order laid,"
2914,THE ARGUMENT.,Before the cavern’s entrance are display’d:
2915,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unmov’d they lie; but, if a blast of wind"
2916,THE ARGUMENT.,"Without, or vapours issue from behind,"
2917,THE ARGUMENT.,"The leafs are borne aloft in liquid air,"
2918,THE ARGUMENT.,"And she resumes no more her museful care,"
2919,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor gathers from the rocks her scatter’d verse,"
2920,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor sets in order what the winds disperse.
2921,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus, many not succeeding, most upbraid"
2922,THE ARGUMENT.,"The madness of the visionary maid,"
2923,THE ARGUMENT.,And with loud curses leave the mystic shade.
2924,THE ARGUMENT.,
2925,THE ARGUMENT.,"“‘Think it not loss of time a while to stay,"
2926,THE ARGUMENT.,Tho’ thy companions chide thy long delay;
2927,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tho’ summon’d to the seas, tho’ pleasing gales"
2928,THE ARGUMENT.,"Invite thy course, and stretch thy swelling sails:"
2929,THE ARGUMENT.,But beg the sacred priestess to relate
2930,THE ARGUMENT.,"With willing words, and not to write thy fate."
2931,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fierce Italian people she will show,"
2932,THE ARGUMENT.,"And all thy wars, and all thy future woe,"
2933,THE ARGUMENT.,"And what thou may’st avoid, and what must undergo."
2934,THE ARGUMENT.,"She shall direct thy course, instruct thy mind,"
2935,THE ARGUMENT.,And teach thee how the happy shores to find.
2936,THE ARGUMENT.,This is what Heav’n allows me to relate:
2937,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now part in peace; pursue thy better fate,"
2938,THE ARGUMENT.,"And raise, by strength of arms, the Trojan state.’"
2939,THE ARGUMENT.,
2940,THE ARGUMENT.,"“This when the priest with friendly voice declar’d,"
2941,THE ARGUMENT.,"He gave me license, and rich gifts prepar’d:"
2942,THE ARGUMENT.,"Bounteous of treasure, he supplied my want"
2943,THE ARGUMENT.,"With heavy gold, and polish’d elephant;"
2944,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Dodonaean caldrons put on board,"
2945,THE ARGUMENT.,And ev’ry ship with sums of silver stor’d.
2946,THE ARGUMENT.,"A trusty coat of mail to me he sent,"
2947,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thrice chain’d with gold, for use and ornament;"
2948,THE ARGUMENT.,"The helm of Pyrrhus added to the rest,"
2949,THE ARGUMENT.,That flourish’d with a plume and waving crest.
2950,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor was my sire forgotten, nor my friends;"
2951,THE ARGUMENT.,And large recruits he to my navy sends:
2952,THE ARGUMENT.,"Men, horses, captains, arms, and warlike stores;"
2953,THE ARGUMENT.,"Supplies new pilots, and new sweeping oars."
2954,THE ARGUMENT.,"Meantime, my sire commands to hoist our sails,"
2955,THE ARGUMENT.,Lest we should lose the first auspicious gales.
2956,THE ARGUMENT.,
2957,THE ARGUMENT.,"“The prophet bless’d the parting crew, and last,"
2958,THE ARGUMENT.,"With words like these, his ancient friend embrac’d:"
2959,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘Old happy man, the care of gods above,"
2960,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whom heav’nly Venus honour’d with her love,"
2961,THE ARGUMENT.,"And twice preserv’d thy life, when Troy was lost,"
2962,THE ARGUMENT.,Behold from far the wish’d Ausonian coast:
2963,THE ARGUMENT.,"There land; but take a larger compass round,"
2964,THE ARGUMENT.,For that before is all forbidden ground.
2965,THE ARGUMENT.,"The shore that Phoebus has design’d for you,"
2966,THE ARGUMENT.,"At farther distance lies, conceal’d from view."
2967,THE ARGUMENT.,"Go happy hence, and seek your new abodes,"
2968,THE ARGUMENT.,"Blest in a son, and favour’d by the gods:"
2969,THE ARGUMENT.,"For I with useless words prolong your stay,"
2970,THE ARGUMENT.,When southern gales have summon’d you away.’
2971,THE ARGUMENT.,
2972,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Nor less the queen our parting thence deplor’d,"
2973,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor was less bounteous than her Trojan lord.
2974,THE ARGUMENT.,"A noble present to my son she brought,"
2975,THE ARGUMENT.,"A robe with flow’rs on golden tissue wrought,"
2976,THE ARGUMENT.,A phrygian vest; and loads with gifts beside
2977,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of precious texture, and of Asian pride."
2978,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘Accept,’ she said, ‘these monuments of love,"
2979,THE ARGUMENT.,Which in my youth with happier hands I wove:
2980,THE ARGUMENT.,Regard these trifles for the giver’s sake;
2981,THE ARGUMENT.,’Tis the last present Hector’s wife can make.
2982,THE ARGUMENT.,Thou call’st my lost Astyanax to mind;
2983,THE ARGUMENT.,In thee his features and his form I find:
2984,THE ARGUMENT.,His eyes so sparkled with a lively flame;
2985,THE ARGUMENT.,Such were his motions; such was all his frame;
2986,THE ARGUMENT.,"And ah! had Heav’n so pleas’d, his years had been the same.’"
2987,THE ARGUMENT.,
2988,THE ARGUMENT.,"“With tears I took my last adieu, and said:"
2989,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘Your fortune, happy pair, already made,"
2990,THE ARGUMENT.,"Leaves you no farther wish. My diff’rent state,"
2991,THE ARGUMENT.,"Avoiding one, incurs another fate."
2992,THE ARGUMENT.,To you a quiet seat the gods allow:
2993,THE ARGUMENT.,"You have no shores to search, no seas to plow,"
2994,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor fields of flying Italy to chase:
2995,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Deluding visions, and a vain embrace!)"
2996,THE ARGUMENT.,"You see another Simois, and enjoy"
2997,THE ARGUMENT.,"The labour of your hands, another Troy,"
2998,THE ARGUMENT.,"With better auspice than her ancient tow’rs,"
2999,THE ARGUMENT.,And less obnoxious to the Grecian pow’rs.
3000,THE ARGUMENT.,"If e’er the gods, whom I with vows adore,"
3001,THE ARGUMENT.,Conduct my steps to Tiber’s happy shore;
3002,THE ARGUMENT.,"If ever I ascend the Latian throne,"
3003,THE ARGUMENT.,And build a city I may call my own;
3004,THE ARGUMENT.,"As both of us our birth from Troy derive,"
3005,THE ARGUMENT.,"So let our kindred lines in concord live,"
3006,THE ARGUMENT.,And both in acts of equal friendship strive.
3007,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our fortunes, good or bad, shall be the same:"
3008,THE ARGUMENT.,The double Troy shall differ but in name;
3009,THE ARGUMENT.,"That what we now begin may never end,"
3010,THE ARGUMENT.,But long to late posterity descend.’
3011,THE ARGUMENT.,
3012,THE ARGUMENT.,“Near the Ceraunian rocks our course we bore;
3013,THE ARGUMENT.,The shortest passage to th’ Italian shore.
3014,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now had the sun withdrawn his radiant light,"
3015,THE ARGUMENT.,And hills were hid in dusky shades of night:
3016,THE ARGUMENT.,"We land, and, on the bosom of the ground,"
3017,THE ARGUMENT.,A safe retreat and a bare lodging found.
3018,THE ARGUMENT.,Close by the shore we lay; the sailors keep
3019,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their watches, and the rest securely sleep."
3020,THE ARGUMENT.,"The night, proceeding on with silent pace,"
3021,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stood in her noon, and view’d with equal face"
3022,THE ARGUMENT.,Her steepy rise and her declining race.
3023,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then wakeful Palinurus rose, to spy"
3024,THE ARGUMENT.,"The face of heav’n, and the nocturnal sky;"
3025,THE ARGUMENT.,And listen’d ev’ry breath of air to try;
3026,THE ARGUMENT.,"Observes the stars, and notes their sliding course,"
3027,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Pleiads, Hyads, and their wat’ry force;"
3028,THE ARGUMENT.,"And both the Bears is careful to behold,"
3029,THE ARGUMENT.,"And bright Orion, arm’d with burnish’d gold."
3030,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, when he saw no threat’ning tempest nigh,"
3031,THE ARGUMENT.,"But a sure promise of a settled sky,"
3032,THE ARGUMENT.,"He gave the sign to weigh; we break our sleep,"
3033,THE ARGUMENT.,"Forsake the pleasing shore, and plow the deep."
3034,THE ARGUMENT.,
3035,THE ARGUMENT.,“And now the rising morn with rosy light
3036,THE ARGUMENT.,"Adorns the skies, and puts the stars to flight;"
3037,THE ARGUMENT.,"When we from far, like bluish mists, descry"
3038,THE ARGUMENT.,"The hills, and then the plains, of Italy."
3039,THE ARGUMENT.,Achates first pronounc’d the joyful sound;
3040,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, ‘Italy!’ the cheerful crew rebound."
3041,THE ARGUMENT.,"My sire Anchises crown’d a cup with wine,"
3042,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, off’ring, thus implor’d the pow’rs divine:"
3043,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘Ye gods, presiding over lands and seas,"
3044,THE ARGUMENT.,"And you who raging winds and waves appease,"
3045,THE ARGUMENT.,"Breathe on our swelling sails a prosp’rous wind,"
3046,THE ARGUMENT.,And smooth our passage to the port assign’d!’
3047,THE ARGUMENT.,"The gentle gales their flagging force renew,"
3048,THE ARGUMENT.,And now the happy harbour is in view.
3049,THE ARGUMENT.,"Minerva’s temple then salutes our sight,"
3050,THE ARGUMENT.,"Plac’d, as a landmark, on the mountain’s height."
3051,THE ARGUMENT.,"We furl our sails, and turn the prows to shore;"
3052,THE ARGUMENT.,The curling waters round the galleys roar.
3053,THE ARGUMENT.,"The land lies open to the raging east,"
3054,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, bending like a bow, with rocks compress’d,"
3055,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shuts out the storms; the winds and waves complain,"
3056,THE ARGUMENT.,And vent their malice on the cliffs in vain.
3057,THE ARGUMENT.,The port lies hid within; on either side
3058,THE ARGUMENT.,Two tow’ring rocks the narrow mouth divide.
3059,THE ARGUMENT.,"The temple, which aloft we view’d before,"
3060,THE ARGUMENT.,"To distance flies, and seems to shun the shore."
3061,THE ARGUMENT.,"Scarce landed, the first omens I beheld"
3062,THE ARGUMENT.,Were four white steeds that cropp’d the flow’ry field.
3063,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘War, war is threaten’d from this foreign ground,’"
3064,THE ARGUMENT.,"My father cried, ‘where warlike steeds are found."
3065,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet, since reclaim’d to chariots they submit,"
3066,THE ARGUMENT.,"And bend to stubborn yokes, and champ the bit,"
3067,THE ARGUMENT.,Peace may succeed to war.’ Our way we bend
3068,THE ARGUMENT.,"To Pallas, and the sacred hill ascend;"
3069,THE ARGUMENT.,"There prostrate to the fierce Virago pray,"
3070,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose temple was the landmark of our way.
3071,THE ARGUMENT.,"Each with a Phrygian mantle veil’d his head,"
3072,THE ARGUMENT.,"And all commands of Helenus obey’d,"
3073,THE ARGUMENT.,And pious rites to Grecian Juno paid.
3074,THE ARGUMENT.,"These dues perform’d, we stretch our sails, and stand"
3075,THE ARGUMENT.,"To sea, forsaking that suspected land."
3076,THE ARGUMENT.,
3077,THE ARGUMENT.,"“From hence Tarentum’s bay appears in view,"
3078,THE ARGUMENT.,"For Hercules renown’d, if fame be true."
3079,THE ARGUMENT.,"Just opposite, Lacinian Juno stands;"
3080,THE ARGUMENT.,"Caulonian tow’rs, and Scylacaean strands,"
3081,THE ARGUMENT.,"For shipwrecks fear’d. Mount Aetna thence we spy,"
3082,THE ARGUMENT.,Known by the smoky flames which cloud the sky.
3083,THE ARGUMENT.,Far off we hear the waves with surly sound
3084,THE ARGUMENT.,"Invade the rocks, the rocks their groans rebound."
3085,THE ARGUMENT.,"The billows break upon the sounding strand,"
3086,THE ARGUMENT.,"And roll the rising tide, impure with sand."
3087,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then thus Anchises, in experience old:"
3088,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘’Tis that Charybdis which the seer foretold,"
3089,THE ARGUMENT.,And those the promis’d rocks! Bear off to sea!’
3090,THE ARGUMENT.,With haste the frighted mariners obey.
3091,THE ARGUMENT.,First Palinurus to the larboard veer’d;
3092,THE ARGUMENT.,Then all the fleet by his example steer’d.
3093,THE ARGUMENT.,"To heav’n aloft on ridgy waves we ride,"
3094,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then down to hell descend, when they divide;"
3095,THE ARGUMENT.,"And thrice our galleys knock’d the stony ground,"
3096,THE ARGUMENT.,"And thrice the hollow rocks return’d the sound,"
3097,THE ARGUMENT.,"And thrice we saw the stars, that stood with dews around."
3098,THE ARGUMENT.,"The flagging winds forsook us, with the sun;"
3099,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, wearied, on Cyclopian shores we run."
3100,THE ARGUMENT.,"The port capacious, and secure from wind,"
3101,THE ARGUMENT.,Is to the foot of thund’ring Aetna join’d.
3102,THE ARGUMENT.,By turns a pitchy cloud she rolls on high;
3103,THE ARGUMENT.,"By turns hot embers from her entrails fly,"
3104,THE ARGUMENT.,"And flakes of mounting flames, that lick the sky."
3105,THE ARGUMENT.,"Oft from her bowels massy rocks are thrown,"
3106,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, shiver’d by the force, come piecemeal down."
3107,THE ARGUMENT.,"Oft liquid lakes of burning sulphur flow,"
3108,THE ARGUMENT.,Fed from the fiery springs that boil below.
3109,THE ARGUMENT.,"Enceladus, they say, transfix’d by Jove,"
3110,THE ARGUMENT.,With blasted limbs came tumbling from above;
3111,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, where he fell, th’ avenging father drew"
3112,THE ARGUMENT.,"This flaming hill, and on his body threw."
3113,THE ARGUMENT.,"As often as he turns his weary sides,"
3114,THE ARGUMENT.,"He shakes the solid isle, and smoke the heavens hides."
3115,THE ARGUMENT.,"In shady woods we pass the tedious night,"
3116,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where bellowing sounds and groans our souls affright,"
3117,THE ARGUMENT.,Of which no cause is offer’d to the sight;
3118,THE ARGUMENT.,"For not one star was kindled in the sky,"
3119,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor could the moon her borrow’d light supply;
3120,THE ARGUMENT.,"For misty clouds involv’d the firmament,"
3121,THE ARGUMENT.,"The stars were muffled, and the moon was pent."
3122,THE ARGUMENT.,
3123,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Scarce had the rising sun the day reveal’d,"
3124,THE ARGUMENT.,"Scarce had his heat the pearly dews dispell’d,"
3125,THE ARGUMENT.,"When from the woods there bolts, before our sight,"
3126,THE ARGUMENT.,"Somewhat betwixt a mortal and a sprite,"
3127,THE ARGUMENT.,"So thin, so ghastly meager, and so wan,"
3128,THE ARGUMENT.,"So bare of flesh, he scarce resembled man."
3129,THE ARGUMENT.,"This thing, all tatter’d, seem’d from far t’implore"
3130,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our pious aid, and pointed to the shore."
3131,THE ARGUMENT.,"We look behind, then view his shaggy beard;"
3132,THE ARGUMENT.,"His clothes were tagg’d with thorns, and filth his limbs"
3133,THE ARGUMENT.,besmear’d;
3134,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rest, in mien, in habit, and in face,"
3135,THE ARGUMENT.,"Appear’d a Greek, and such indeed he was."
3136,THE ARGUMENT.,"He cast on us, from far, a frightful view,"
3137,THE ARGUMENT.,Whom soon for Trojans and for foes he knew;
3138,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stood still, and paus’d; then all at once began"
3139,THE ARGUMENT.,"To stretch his limbs, and trembled as he ran."
3140,THE ARGUMENT.,"Soon as approach’d, upon his knees he falls,"
3141,THE ARGUMENT.,And thus with tears and sighs for pity calls:
3142,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘Now, by the pow’rs above, and what we share"
3143,THE ARGUMENT.,"From Nature’s common gift, this vital air,"
3144,THE ARGUMENT.,"O Trojans, take me hence! I beg no more;"
3145,THE ARGUMENT.,But bear me far from this unhappy shore.
3146,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Tis true, I am a Greek, and farther own,"
3147,THE ARGUMENT.,Among your foes besieg’d th’ imperial town.
3148,THE ARGUMENT.,"For such demerits if my death be due,"
3149,THE ARGUMENT.,No more for this abandon’d life I sue;
3150,THE ARGUMENT.,"This only favour let my tears obtain,"
3151,THE ARGUMENT.,To throw me headlong in the rapid main:
3152,THE ARGUMENT.,"Since nothing more than death my crime demands,"
3153,THE ARGUMENT.,"I die content, to die by human hands.’"
3154,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said, and on his knees my knees embrac’d:"
3155,THE ARGUMENT.,"I bade him boldly tell his fortune past,"
3156,THE ARGUMENT.,"His present state, his lineage, and his name,"
3157,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ occasion of his fears, and whence he came."
3158,THE ARGUMENT.,The good Anchises rais’d him with his hand;
3159,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who, thus encourag’d, answer’d our demand:"
3160,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘From Ithaca, my native soil, I came"
3161,THE ARGUMENT.,To Troy; and Achaemenides my name.
3162,THE ARGUMENT.,Me my poor father with Ulysses sent;
3163,THE ARGUMENT.,"(O had I stay’d, with poverty content!)"
3164,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, fearful for themselves, my countrymen"
3165,THE ARGUMENT.,Left me forsaken in the Cyclops’ den.
3166,THE ARGUMENT.,"The cave, tho’ large, was dark; the dismal floor"
3167,THE ARGUMENT.,Was pav’d with mangled limbs and putrid gore.
3168,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our monstrous host, of more than human size,"
3169,THE ARGUMENT.,"Erects his head, and stares within the skies;"
3170,THE ARGUMENT.,"Bellowing his voice, and horrid is his hue."
3171,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ye gods, remove this plague from mortal view!"
3172,THE ARGUMENT.,The joints of slaughter’d wretches are his food;
3173,THE ARGUMENT.,And for his wine he quaffs the streaming blood.
3174,THE ARGUMENT.,"These eyes beheld, when with his spacious hand"
3175,THE ARGUMENT.,He seiz’d two captives of our Grecian band;
3176,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stretch’d on his back, he dash’d against the stones"
3177,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their broken bodies, and their crackling bones:"
3178,THE ARGUMENT.,"With spouting blood the purple pavement swims,"
3179,THE ARGUMENT.,While the dire glutton grinds the trembling limbs.
3180,THE ARGUMENT.,
3181,THE ARGUMENT.,"“‘Not unreveng’d Ulysses bore their fate,"
3182,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor thoughtless of his own unhappy state;
3183,THE ARGUMENT.,"For, gorg’d with flesh, and drunk with human wine"
3184,THE ARGUMENT.,"While fast asleep the giant lay supine,"
3185,THE ARGUMENT.,"Snoring aloud, and belching from his maw"
3186,THE ARGUMENT.,"His indigested foam, and morsels raw;"
3187,THE ARGUMENT.,"We pray; we cast the lots, and then surround"
3188,THE ARGUMENT.,"The monstrous body, stretch’d along the ground:"
3189,THE ARGUMENT.,"Each, as he could approach him, lends a hand"
3190,THE ARGUMENT.,To bore his eyeball with a flaming brand.
3191,THE ARGUMENT.,Beneath his frowning forehead lay his eye;
3192,THE ARGUMENT.,For only one did the vast frame supply;
3193,THE ARGUMENT.,"But that a globe so large, his front it fill’d,"
3194,THE ARGUMENT.,Like the sun’s disk or like a Grecian shield.
3195,THE ARGUMENT.,The stroke succeeds; and down the pupil bends:
3196,THE ARGUMENT.,This vengeance follow’d for our slaughter’d friends.
3197,THE ARGUMENT.,"But haste, unhappy wretches, haste to fly!"
3198,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your cables cut, and on your oars rely!"
3199,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such, and so vast as Polypheme appears,"
3200,THE ARGUMENT.,A hundred more this hated island bears:
3201,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like him, in caves they shut their woolly sheep;"
3202,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like him, their herds on tops of mountains keep;"
3203,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like him, with mighty strides, they stalk from steep to steep"
3204,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now three moons their sharpen’d horns renew,"
3205,THE ARGUMENT.,"Since thus, in woods and wilds, obscure from view,"
3206,THE ARGUMENT.,"I drag my loathsome days with mortal fright,"
3207,THE ARGUMENT.,And in deserted caverns lodge by night;
3208,THE ARGUMENT.,Oft from the rocks a dreadful prospect see
3209,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of the huge Cyclops, like a walking tree:"
3210,THE ARGUMENT.,"From far I hear his thund’ring voice resound,"
3211,THE ARGUMENT.,And trampling feet that shake the solid ground.
3212,THE ARGUMENT.,"Cornels and salvage berries of the wood,"
3213,THE ARGUMENT.,"And roots and herbs, have been my meager food."
3214,THE ARGUMENT.,"While all around my longing eyes I cast,"
3215,THE ARGUMENT.,I saw your happy ships appear at last.
3216,THE ARGUMENT.,"On those I fix’d my hopes, to these I run;"
3217,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Tis all I ask, this cruel race to shun;"
3218,THE ARGUMENT.,"What other death you please, yourselves bestow.’"
3219,THE ARGUMENT.,
3220,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Scarce had he said, when on the mountain’s brow"
3221,THE ARGUMENT.,We saw the giant shepherd stalk before
3222,THE ARGUMENT.,"His following flock, and leading to the shore:"
3223,THE ARGUMENT.,"A monstrous bulk, deform’d, depriv’d of sight;"
3224,THE ARGUMENT.,"His staff a trunk of pine, to guide his steps aright."
3225,THE ARGUMENT.,His pond’rous whistle from his neck descends;
3226,THE ARGUMENT.,His woolly care their pensive lord attends:
3227,THE ARGUMENT.,This only solace his hard fortune sends.
3228,THE ARGUMENT.,"Soon as he reach’d the shore and touch’d the waves,"
3229,THE ARGUMENT.,From his bor’d eye the gutt’ring blood he laves:
3230,THE ARGUMENT.,"He gnash’d his teeth, and groan’d; thro’ seas he strides,"
3231,THE ARGUMENT.,And scarce the topmost billows touch’d his sides.
3232,THE ARGUMENT.,
3233,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Seiz’d with a sudden fear, we run to sea,"
3234,THE ARGUMENT.,"The cables cut, and silent haste away;"
3235,THE ARGUMENT.,The well-deserving stranger entertain;
3236,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, buckling to the work, our oars divide the main."
3237,THE ARGUMENT.,The giant harken’d to the dashing sound:
3238,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, when our vessels out of reach he found,"
3239,THE ARGUMENT.,"He strided onward, and in vain essay’d"
3240,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ Ionian deep, and durst no farther wade."
3241,THE ARGUMENT.,With that he roar’d aloud: the dreadful cry
3242,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shakes earth, and air, and seas; the billows fly"
3243,THE ARGUMENT.,Before the bellowing noise to distant Italy.
3244,THE ARGUMENT.,"The neighb’ring Aetna trembling all around,"
3245,THE ARGUMENT.,The winding caverns echo to the sound.
3246,THE ARGUMENT.,"His brother Cyclops hear the yelling roar,"
3247,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, rushing down the mountains, crowd the shore."
3248,THE ARGUMENT.,"We saw their stern distorted looks, from far,"
3249,THE ARGUMENT.,"And one-eyed glance, that vainly threaten’d war:"
3250,THE ARGUMENT.,"A dreadful council, with their heads on high;"
3251,THE ARGUMENT.,(The misty clouds about their foreheads fly;)
3252,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not yielding to the tow’ring tree of Jove,"
3253,THE ARGUMENT.,Or tallest cypress of Diana’s grove.
3254,THE ARGUMENT.,New pangs of mortal fear our minds assail;
3255,THE ARGUMENT.,"We tug at ev’ry oar, and hoist up ev’ry sail,"
3256,THE ARGUMENT.,And take th’ advantage of the friendly gale.
3257,THE ARGUMENT.,"Forewarn’d by Helenus, we strive to shun"
3258,THE ARGUMENT.,"Charybdis’ gulf, nor dare to Scylla run."
3259,THE ARGUMENT.,An equal fate on either side appears:
3260,THE ARGUMENT.,"We, tacking to the left, are free from fears;"
3261,THE ARGUMENT.,"For, from Pelorus’ point, the North arose,"
3262,THE ARGUMENT.,And drove us back where swift Pantagias flows.
3263,THE ARGUMENT.,"His rocky mouth we pass, and make our way"
3264,THE ARGUMENT.,By Thapsus and Megara’s winding bay.
3265,THE ARGUMENT.,"This passage Achaemenides had shown,"
3266,THE ARGUMENT.,Tracing the course which he before had run.
3267,THE ARGUMENT.,
3268,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Right o’er against Plemmyrium’s wat’ry strand,"
3269,THE ARGUMENT.,There lies an isle once call’d th’ Ortygian land.
3270,THE ARGUMENT.,"Alpheus, as old fame reports, has found"
3271,THE ARGUMENT.,"From Greece a secret passage under ground,"
3272,THE ARGUMENT.,By love to beauteous Arethusa led;
3273,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, mingling here, they roll in the same sacred bed."
3274,THE ARGUMENT.,"As Helenus enjoin’d, we next adore"
3275,THE ARGUMENT.,"Diana’s name, protectress of the shore."
3276,THE ARGUMENT.,With prosp’rous gales we pass the quiet sounds
3277,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of still Elorus, and his fruitful bounds."
3278,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, doubling Cape Pachynus, we survey"
3279,THE ARGUMENT.,The rocky shore extended to the sea.
3280,THE ARGUMENT.,"The town of Camarine from far we see,"
3281,THE ARGUMENT.,"And fenny lake, undrain’d by fate’s decree."
3282,THE ARGUMENT.,"In sight of the Geloan fields we pass,"
3283,THE ARGUMENT.,"And the large walls, where mighty Gela was;"
3284,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Agragas, with lofty summits crown’d,"
3285,THE ARGUMENT.,Long for the race of warlike steeds renown’d.
3286,THE ARGUMENT.,"We pass’d Selinus, and the palmy land,"
3287,THE ARGUMENT.,"And widely shun the Lilybaean strand,"
3288,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unsafe, for secret rocks and moving sand."
3289,THE ARGUMENT.,"At length on shore the weary fleet arriv’d,"
3290,THE ARGUMENT.,Which Drepanum’s unhappy port receiv’d.
3291,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here, after endless labours, often toss’d"
3292,THE ARGUMENT.,"By raging storms, and driv’n on ev’ry coast,"
3293,THE ARGUMENT.,"My dear, dear father, spent with age, I lost:"
3294,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ease of my cares, and solace of my pain,"
3295,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sav’d thro’ a thousand toils, but sav’d in vain"
3296,THE ARGUMENT.,"The prophet, who my future woes reveal’d,"
3297,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet this, the greatest and the worst, conceal’d;"
3298,THE ARGUMENT.,"And dire Celaeno, whose foreboding skill"
3299,THE ARGUMENT.,"Denounc’d all else, was silent of the ill."
3300,THE ARGUMENT.,This my last labour was. Some friendly god
3301,THE ARGUMENT.,From thence convey’d us to your blest abode.”
3302,THE ARGUMENT.,
3303,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus, to the list’ning queen, the royal guest"
3304,THE ARGUMENT.,His wand’ring course and all his toils express’d;
3305,THE ARGUMENT.,"And here concluding, he retir’d to rest."

3313,THE ARGUMENT.,
3314,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dido discovers to her sister her passion for Aeneas, and her"
3315,THE ARGUMENT.,thoughts of marrying him. She prepares a hunting match for his
3316,THE ARGUMENT.,"entertainment. Juno, by Venus’ consent, raises a storm, which"
3317,THE ARGUMENT.,"separates the hunters, and drives Aeneas and Dido into the same"
3318,THE ARGUMENT.,"cave, where their marriage is supposed to be completed. Jupiter"
3319,THE ARGUMENT.,"despatches Mercury to Aeneas, to warn him from Carthage. Aeneas"
3320,THE ARGUMENT.,"secretly prepares for his voyage. Dido finds out his design, and,"
3321,THE ARGUMENT.,"to put a stop to it, makes use of her own and her sister’s"
3322,THE ARGUMENT.,"entreaties, and discovers all the variety of passions that are"
3323,THE ARGUMENT.,incident to a neglected lover. When nothing could prevail upon
3324,THE ARGUMENT.,"him, she contrives her own death, with which this book concludes."
3325,THE ARGUMENT.,
3326,THE ARGUMENT.,
3327,THE ARGUMENT.,But anxious cares already seiz’d the queen:
3328,THE ARGUMENT.,She fed within her veins a flame unseen;
3329,THE ARGUMENT.,"The hero’s valour, acts, and birth inspire"
3330,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her soul with love, and fan the secret fire."
3331,THE ARGUMENT.,"His words, his looks, imprinted in her heart,"

3333,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, when the purple morn had chas’d away"
3334,THE ARGUMENT.,"The dewy shadows, and restor’d the day,"
3335,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her sister first with early care she sought,"
3336,THE ARGUMENT.,And thus in mournful accents eas’d her thought:
3337,THE ARGUMENT.,
3338,THE ARGUMENT.,"“My dearest Anna, what new dreams affright"
3339,THE ARGUMENT.,My lab’ring soul! what visions of the night
3340,THE ARGUMENT.,"Disturb my quiet, and distract my breast"
3341,THE ARGUMENT.,With strange ideas of our Trojan guest!
3342,THE ARGUMENT.,"His worth, his actions, and majestic air,"
3343,THE ARGUMENT.,A man descended from the gods declare.
3344,THE ARGUMENT.,Fear ever argues a degenerate kind;
3345,THE ARGUMENT.,His birth is well asserted by his mind.
3346,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, what he suffer’d, when by Fate betray’d!"
3347,THE ARGUMENT.,What brave attempts for falling Troy he made!
3348,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such were his looks, so gracefully he spoke,"
3349,THE ARGUMENT.,"That, were I not resolv’d against the yoke"
3350,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of hapless marriage, never to be curst"
3351,THE ARGUMENT.,"With second love, so fatal was my first,"
3352,THE ARGUMENT.,To this one error I might yield again;
3353,THE ARGUMENT.,"For, since Sichaeus was untimely slain,"
3354,THE ARGUMENT.,This only man is able to subvert
3355,THE ARGUMENT.,The fix’d foundations of my stubborn heart.
3356,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, to confess my frailty, to my shame,"
3357,THE ARGUMENT.,"Somewhat I find within, if not the same,"
3358,THE ARGUMENT.,Too like the sparkles of my former flame.
3359,THE ARGUMENT.,"But first let yawning earth a passage rend,"
3360,THE ARGUMENT.,And let me thro’ the dark abyss descend;
3361,THE ARGUMENT.,"First let avenging Jove, with flames from high,"
3362,THE ARGUMENT.,"Drive down this body to the nether sky,"
3363,THE ARGUMENT.,"Condemn’d with ghosts in endless night to lie,"

3365,THE ARGUMENT.,No! he who had my vows shall ever have;
3366,THE ARGUMENT.,"For, whom I lov’d on earth, I worship in the grave.”"
3367,THE ARGUMENT.,
3368,THE ARGUMENT.,"She said: the tears ran gushing from her eyes,"
3369,THE ARGUMENT.,And stopp’d her speech. Her sister thus replies:
3370,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O dearer than the vital air I breathe,"
3371,THE ARGUMENT.,"Will you to grief your blooming years bequeath,"
3372,THE ARGUMENT.,"Condemn’d to waste in woes your lonely life,"
3373,THE ARGUMENT.,Without the joys of mother or of wife?
3374,THE ARGUMENT.,"Think you these tears, this pompous train of woe,"
3375,THE ARGUMENT.,Are known or valued by the ghosts below?
3376,THE ARGUMENT.,"I grant that, while your sorrows yet were green,"

3380,THE ARGUMENT.,With all the Libyan lords of mighty name;
3381,THE ARGUMENT.,But will you fight against a pleasing flame!
3382,THE ARGUMENT.,"This little spot of land, which Heav’n bestows,"
3383,THE ARGUMENT.,On ev’ry side is hemm’d with warlike foes;
3384,THE ARGUMENT.,"Gaetulian cities here are spread around,"
3385,THE ARGUMENT.,And fierce Numidians there your frontiers bound;
3386,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here lies a barren waste of thirsty land,"
3387,THE ARGUMENT.,And there the Syrtes raise the moving sand;
3388,THE ARGUMENT.,"Barcaean troops besiege the narrow shore,"
3389,THE ARGUMENT.,And from the sea Pygmalion threatens more.
3390,THE ARGUMENT.,"Propitious Heav’n, and gracious Juno, lead"

3394,THE ARGUMENT.,"Implore the favour of the pow’rs above,"

3400,THE ARGUMENT.,
3401,THE ARGUMENT.,"These words, which from a friend and sister came,"

3404,THE ARGUMENT.,"Inspir’d with hope, the project they pursue;"
3405,THE ARGUMENT.,On ev’ry altar sacrifice renew:
3406,THE ARGUMENT.,A chosen ewe of two years old they pay

3408,THE ARGUMENT.,"Preferring Juno’s pow’r, for Juno ties"
3409,THE ARGUMENT.,The nuptial knot and makes the marriage joys.
3410,THE ARGUMENT.,"The beauteous queen before her altar stands,"
3411,THE ARGUMENT.,And holds the golden goblet in her hands.
3412,THE ARGUMENT.,"A milk-white heifer she with flow’rs adorns,"
3413,THE ARGUMENT.,And pours the ruddy wine betwixt her horns;
3414,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, while the priests with pray’r the gods invoke,"
3415,THE ARGUMENT.,"She feeds their altars with Sabaean smoke,"
3416,THE ARGUMENT.,"With hourly care the sacrifice renews,"
3417,THE ARGUMENT.,And anxiously the panting entrails views.
3418,THE ARGUMENT.,"What priestly rites, alas! what pious art,"
3419,THE ARGUMENT.,What vows avail to cure a bleeding heart!
3420,THE ARGUMENT.,"A gentle fire she feeds within her veins,"
3421,THE ARGUMENT.,Where the soft god secure in silence reigns.
3422,THE ARGUMENT.,
3423,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sick with desire, and seeking him she loves,"
3424,THE ARGUMENT.,From street to street the raving Dido roves.
3425,THE ARGUMENT.,"So when the watchful shepherd, from the blind,"
3426,THE ARGUMENT.,"Wounds with a random shaft the careless hind,"
3427,THE ARGUMENT.,"Distracted with her pain she flies the woods,"
3428,THE ARGUMENT.,"Bounds o’er the lawn, and seeks the silent floods,"
3429,THE ARGUMENT.,With fruitless care; for still the fatal dart
3430,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sticks in her side, and rankles in her heart."
3431,THE ARGUMENT.,And now she leads the Trojan chief along
3432,THE ARGUMENT.,"The lofty walls, amidst the busy throng;"
3433,THE ARGUMENT.,"Displays her Tyrian wealth, and rising town,"
3434,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which love, without his labour, makes his own."
3435,THE ARGUMENT.,"This pomp she shows, to tempt her wand’ring guest;"
3436,THE ARGUMENT.,Her falt’ring tongue forbids to speak the rest.
3437,THE ARGUMENT.,"When day declines, and feasts renew the night,"
3438,THE ARGUMENT.,Still on his face she feeds her famish’d sight;
3439,THE ARGUMENT.,She longs again to hear the prince relate
3440,THE ARGUMENT.,His own adventures and the Trojan fate.
3441,THE ARGUMENT.,"He tells it o’er and o’er; but still in vain,"
3442,THE ARGUMENT.,For still she begs to hear it once again.
3443,THE ARGUMENT.,"The hearer on the speaker’s mouth depends,"
3444,THE ARGUMENT.,And thus the tragic story never ends.
3445,THE ARGUMENT.,
3446,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, when they part, when Phoebe’s paler light"

3453,THE ARGUMENT.,If love by likeness might be so beguil’d.
3454,THE ARGUMENT.,
3455,THE ARGUMENT.,Meantime the rising tow’rs are at a stand;
3456,THE ARGUMENT.,"No labours exercise the youthful band,"
3457,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor use of arts, nor toils of arms they know;"
3458,THE ARGUMENT.,The mole is left unfinish’d to the foe;
3459,THE ARGUMENT.,"The mounds, the works, the walls, neglected lie,"
3460,THE ARGUMENT.,"Short of their promis’d heighth, that seem’d to threat the sky,"

3462,THE ARGUMENT.,"But when imperial Juno, from above,"

3464,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hot with the venom which her veins inflam’d,"
3465,THE ARGUMENT.,"And by no sense of shame to be reclaim’d,"
3466,THE ARGUMENT.,With soothing words to Venus she begun:

3470,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor am I ignorant, you both suspect"
3471,THE ARGUMENT.,"This rising city, which my hands erect:"
3472,THE ARGUMENT.,But shall celestial discord never cease?
3473,THE ARGUMENT.,’Tis better ended in a lasting peace.
3474,THE ARGUMENT.,You stand possess’d of all your soul desir’d:
3475,THE ARGUMENT.,Poor Dido with consuming love is fir’d.
3476,THE ARGUMENT.,Your Trojan with my Tyrian let us join;
3477,THE ARGUMENT.,"So Dido shall be yours, Aeneas mine:"
3478,THE ARGUMENT.,"One common kingdom, one united line."
3479,THE ARGUMENT.,"Eliza shall a Dardan lord obey,"
3480,THE ARGUMENT.,And lofty Carthage for a dow’r convey.”
3481,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Venus, who her hidden fraud descried,"
3482,THE ARGUMENT.,Which would the scepter of the world misguide
3483,THE ARGUMENT.,"To Libyan shores, thus artfully replied:"
3484,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Who, but a fool, would wars with Juno choose,"
3485,THE ARGUMENT.,"And such alliance and such gifts refuse,"
3486,THE ARGUMENT.,If Fortune with our joint desires comply?
3487,THE ARGUMENT.,The doubt is all from Jove and destiny;
3488,THE ARGUMENT.,"Lest he forbid, with absolute command,"
3489,THE ARGUMENT.,To mix the people in one common land.
3490,THE ARGUMENT.,Or will the Trojan and the Tyrian line
3491,THE ARGUMENT.,In lasting leagues and sure succession join?
3492,THE ARGUMENT.,"But you, the partner of his bed and throne,"
3493,THE ARGUMENT.,May move his mind; my wishes are your own.”
3494,THE ARGUMENT.,
3495,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Mine,” said imperial Juno, “be the care;"
3496,THE ARGUMENT.,"Time urges, now, to perfect this affair:"
3497,THE ARGUMENT.,"Attend my counsel, and the secret share."
3498,THE ARGUMENT.,"When next the Sun his rising light displays,"
3499,THE ARGUMENT.,"And gilds the world below with purple rays,"
3500,THE ARGUMENT.,"The queen, Aeneas, and the Tyrian court"
3501,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shall to the shady woods, for sylvan game, resort."
3502,THE ARGUMENT.,"There, while the huntsmen pitch their toils around,"
3503,THE ARGUMENT.,"And cheerful horns from side to side resound,"
3504,THE ARGUMENT.,A pitchy cloud shall cover all the plain
3505,THE ARGUMENT.,"With hail, and thunder, and tempestuous rain;"
3506,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fearful train shall take their speedy flight,"
3507,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dispers’d, and all involv’d in gloomy night;"
3508,THE ARGUMENT.,One cave a grateful shelter shall afford
3509,THE ARGUMENT.,To the fair princess and the Trojan lord.
3510,THE ARGUMENT.,"I will myself the bridal bed prepare,"
3511,THE ARGUMENT.,"If you, to bless the nuptials, will be there:"
3512,THE ARGUMENT.,"So shall their loves be crown’d with due delights,"
3513,THE ARGUMENT.,And Hymen shall be present at the rites.”
3514,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Queen of Love consents, and closely smiles"
3515,THE ARGUMENT.,"At her vain project, and discover’d wiles."
3516,THE ARGUMENT.,
3517,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rosy morn was risen from the main,"
3518,THE ARGUMENT.,And horns and hounds awake the princely train:
3519,THE ARGUMENT.,"They issue early thro’ the city gate,"
3520,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where the more wakeful huntsmen ready wait,"
3521,THE ARGUMENT.,"With nets, and toils, and darts, beside the force"
3522,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of Spartan dogs, and swift Massylian horse."
3523,THE ARGUMENT.,The Tyrian peers and officers of state
3524,THE ARGUMENT.,For the slow queen in antechambers wait;
3525,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her lofty courser, in the court below,"
3526,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who his majestic rider seems to know,"
3527,THE ARGUMENT.,"Proud of his purple trappings, paws the ground,"
3528,THE ARGUMENT.,"And champs the golden bit, and spreads the foam around."
3529,THE ARGUMENT.,The queen at length appears; on either hand
3530,THE ARGUMENT.,The brawny guards in martial order stand.
3531,THE ARGUMENT.,"A flow’r’d simar with golden fringe she wore,"
3532,THE ARGUMENT.,And at her back a golden quiver bore;
3533,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her flowing hair a golden caul restrains,"
3534,THE ARGUMENT.,A golden clasp the Tyrian robe sustains.
3535,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace,"
3536,THE ARGUMENT.,Leads on the Trojan youth to view the chase.
3537,THE ARGUMENT.,But far above the rest in beauty shines
3538,THE ARGUMENT.,"The great Aeneas, the troop he joins;"
3539,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like fair Apollo, when he leaves the frost"
3540,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of wint’ry Xanthus, and the Lycian coast,"
3541,THE ARGUMENT.,"When to his native Delos he resorts,"
3542,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ordains the dances, and renews the sports;"
3543,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where painted Scythians, mix’d with Cretan bands,"
3544,THE ARGUMENT.,Before the joyful altars join their hands:
3545,THE ARGUMENT.,"Himself, on Cynthus walking, sees below"
3546,THE ARGUMENT.,The merry madness of the sacred show.
3547,THE ARGUMENT.,Green wreaths of bays his length of hair inclose;
3548,THE ARGUMENT.,A golden fillet binds his awful brows;
3549,THE ARGUMENT.,His quiver sounds: not less the prince is seen
3550,THE ARGUMENT.,"In manly presence, or in lofty mien."
3551,THE ARGUMENT.,
3552,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now had they reach’d the hills, and storm’d the seat"
3553,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of salvage beasts, in dens, their last retreat."
3554,THE ARGUMENT.,The cry pursues the mountain goats: they bound
3555,THE ARGUMENT.,"From rock to rock, and keep the craggy ground;"
3556,THE ARGUMENT.,"Quite otherwise the stags, a trembling train,"
3557,THE ARGUMENT.,"In herds unsingled, scour the dusty plain,"
3558,THE ARGUMENT.,And a long chase in open view maintain.
3559,THE ARGUMENT.,"The glad Ascanius, as his courser guides,"
3560,THE ARGUMENT.,"Spurs thro’ the vale, and these and those outrides."
3561,THE ARGUMENT.,His horse’s flanks and sides are forc’d to feel
3562,THE ARGUMENT.,"The clanking lash, and goring of the steel."
3563,THE ARGUMENT.,"Impatiently he views the feeble prey,"
3564,THE ARGUMENT.,"Wishing some nobler beast to cross his way,"
3565,THE ARGUMENT.,"And rather would the tusky boar attend,"
3566,THE ARGUMENT.,Or see the tawny lion downward bend.
3567,THE ARGUMENT.,
3568,THE ARGUMENT.,"Meantime, the gath’ring clouds obscure the skies:"
3569,THE ARGUMENT.,From pole to pole the forky lightning flies;
3570,THE ARGUMENT.,The rattling thunders roll; and Juno pours
3571,THE ARGUMENT.,"A wintry deluge down, and sounding show’rs."
3572,THE ARGUMENT.,"The company, dispers’d, to converts ride,"
3573,THE ARGUMENT.,"And seek the homely cots, or mountain’s hollow side."
3574,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rapid rains, descending from the hills,"
3575,THE ARGUMENT.,To rolling torrents raise the creeping rills.
3576,THE ARGUMENT.,"The queen and prince, as love or fortune guides,"
3577,THE ARGUMENT.,One common cavern in her bosom hides.
3578,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then first the trembling earth the signal gave,"
3579,THE ARGUMENT.,And flashing fires enlighten all the cave;
3580,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hell from below, and Juno from above,"
3581,THE ARGUMENT.,"And howling nymphs, were conscious of their love."
3582,THE ARGUMENT.,From this ill-omen’d hour in time arose
3583,THE ARGUMENT.,"Debate and death, and all succeeding woes."
3584,THE ARGUMENT.,
3585,THE ARGUMENT.,"The queen, whom sense of honour could not move,"
3586,THE ARGUMENT.,"No longer made a secret of her love,"
3587,THE ARGUMENT.,"But call’d it marriage, by that specious name"
3588,THE ARGUMENT.,To veil the crime and sanctify the shame.
3589,THE ARGUMENT.,
3590,THE ARGUMENT.,The loud report thro’ Libyan cities goes.
3591,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fame, the great ill, from small beginnings grows:"
3592,THE ARGUMENT.,Swift from the first; and ev’ry moment brings
3593,THE ARGUMENT.,"New vigour to her flights, new pinions to her wings."
3594,THE ARGUMENT.,Soon grows the pigmy to gigantic size;
3595,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her feet on earth, her forehead in the skies."
3596,THE ARGUMENT.,"Inrag’d against the gods, revengeful Earth"
3597,THE ARGUMENT.,Produc’d her last of the Titanian birth.
3598,THE ARGUMENT.,"Swift is her walk, more swift her winged haste:"
3599,THE ARGUMENT.,"A monstrous phantom, horrible and vast."
3600,THE ARGUMENT.,"As many plumes as raise her lofty flight,"
3601,THE ARGUMENT.,So many piercing eyes inlarge her sight;
3602,THE ARGUMENT.,"Millions of opening mouths to Fame belong,"
3603,THE ARGUMENT.,"And ev’ry mouth is furnish’d with a tongue,"
3604,THE ARGUMENT.,And round with list’ning ears the flying plague is hung.
3605,THE ARGUMENT.,She fills the peaceful universe with cries;
3606,THE ARGUMENT.,No slumbers ever close her wakeful eyes;
3607,THE ARGUMENT.,"By day, from lofty tow’rs her head she shews,"
3608,THE ARGUMENT.,And spreads thro’ trembling crowds disastrous news;
3609,THE ARGUMENT.,"With court informers haunts, and royal spies;"
3610,THE ARGUMENT.,"Things done relates, not done she feigns, and mingles truth with"
3611,THE ARGUMENT.,lies.
3612,THE ARGUMENT.,
3613,THE ARGUMENT.,"Talk is her business, and her chief delight"
3614,THE ARGUMENT.,To tell of prodigies and cause affright.
3615,THE ARGUMENT.,"She fills the people’s ears with Dido’s name,"
3616,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who, lost to honour and the sense of shame,"
3617,THE ARGUMENT.,Admits into her throne and nuptial bed
3618,THE ARGUMENT.,"A wand’ring guest, who from his country fled:"
3619,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whole days with him she passes in delights,"
3620,THE ARGUMENT.,"And wastes in luxury long winter nights,"
3621,THE ARGUMENT.,"Forgetful of her fame and royal trust,"
3622,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dissolv’d in ease, abandon’d to her lust."
3623,THE ARGUMENT.,
3624,THE ARGUMENT.,"The goddess widely spreads the loud report,"
3625,THE ARGUMENT.,And flies at length to King Hyarba’s court.
3626,THE ARGUMENT.,When first possess’d with this unwelcome news
3627,THE ARGUMENT.,Whom did he not of men and gods accuse?
3628,THE ARGUMENT.,"This prince, from ravish’d Garamantis born,"
3629,THE ARGUMENT.,"A hundred temples did with spoils adorn,"
3630,THE ARGUMENT.,"In Ammon’s honour, his celestial sire;"
3631,THE ARGUMENT.,A hundred altars fed with wakeful fire;
3632,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, thro’ his vast dominions, priests ordain’d,"
3633,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose watchful care these holy rites maintain’d.
3634,THE ARGUMENT.,"The gates and columns were with garlands crown’d,"
3635,THE ARGUMENT.,And blood of victim beasts enrich’d the ground.
3636,THE ARGUMENT.,
3637,THE ARGUMENT.,"He, when he heard a fugitive could move"
3638,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Tyrian princess, who disdain’d his love,"
3639,THE ARGUMENT.,"His breast with fury burn’d, his eyes with fire,"
3640,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mad with despair, impatient with desire;"
3641,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then on the sacred altars pouring wine,"
3642,THE ARGUMENT.,He thus with pray’rs implor’d his sire divine:
3643,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Great Jove! propitious to the Moorish race,"
3644,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who feast on painted beds, with off’rings grace"
3645,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy temples, and adore thy pow’r divine"
3646,THE ARGUMENT.,"With blood of victims, and with sparkling wine,"
3647,THE ARGUMENT.,Seest thou not this? or do we fear in vain
3648,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy boasted thunder, and thy thoughtless reign?"
3649,THE ARGUMENT.,Do thy broad hands the forky lightnings lance?
3650,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thine are the bolts, or the blind work of chance?"
3651,THE ARGUMENT.,"A wand’ring woman builds, within our state,"
3652,THE ARGUMENT.,"A little town, bought at an easy rate;"
3653,THE ARGUMENT.,"She pays me homage, and my grants allow"
3654,THE ARGUMENT.,A narrow space of Libyan lands to plow;
3655,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet, scorning me, by passion blindly led,"
3656,THE ARGUMENT.,Admits a banish’d Trojan to her bed!
3657,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now this other Paris, with his train"
3658,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of conquer’d cowards, must in Afric reign!"
3659,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Whom, what they are, their looks and garb confess,"
3660,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their locks with oil perfum’d, their Lydian dress.)"
3661,THE ARGUMENT.,"He takes the spoil, enjoys the princely dame;"
3662,THE ARGUMENT.,"And I, rejected I, adore an empty name.”"
3663,THE ARGUMENT.,
3664,THE ARGUMENT.,"His vows, in haughty terms, he thus preferr’d,"
3665,THE ARGUMENT.,And held his altar’s horns. The mighty Thund’rer heard;
3666,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then cast his eyes on Carthage, where he found"
3667,THE ARGUMENT.,"The lustful pair in lawless pleasure drown’d,"
3668,THE ARGUMENT.,"Lost in their loves, insensible of shame,"
3669,THE ARGUMENT.,And both forgetful of their better fame.
3670,THE ARGUMENT.,"He calls Cyllenius, and the god attends,"
3671,THE ARGUMENT.,By whom his menacing command he sends:
3672,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Go, mount the western winds, and cleave the sky;"
3673,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, with a swift descent, to Carthage fly:"
3674,THE ARGUMENT.,"There find the Trojan chief, who wastes his days"
3675,THE ARGUMENT.,"In slothful riot and inglorious ease,"
3676,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor minds the future city, giv’n by fate."
3677,THE ARGUMENT.,To him this message from my mouth relate:
3678,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘Not so fair Venus hop’d, when twice she won"
3679,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy life with pray’rs, nor promis’d such a son."
3680,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hers was a hero, destin’d to command"
3681,THE ARGUMENT.,"A martial race, and rule the Latian land,"
3682,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who should his ancient line from Teucer draw,"
3683,THE ARGUMENT.,And on the conquer’d world impose the law.’
3684,THE ARGUMENT.,"If glory cannot move a mind so mean,"
3685,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor future praise from fading pleasure wean,"
3686,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet why should he defraud his son of fame,"
3687,THE ARGUMENT.,And grudge the Romans their immortal name!
3688,THE ARGUMENT.,What are his vain designs! what hopes he more
3689,THE ARGUMENT.,"From his long ling’ring on a hostile shore,"
3690,THE ARGUMENT.,"Regardless to redeem his honour lost,"
3691,THE ARGUMENT.,And for his race to gain th’ Ausonian coast!
3692,THE ARGUMENT.,Bid him with speed the Tyrian court forsake;
3693,THE ARGUMENT.,With this command the slumb’ring warrior wake.”
3694,THE ARGUMENT.,
3695,THE ARGUMENT.,Hermes obeys; with golden pinions binds
3696,THE ARGUMENT.,"His flying feet, and mounts the western winds:"
3697,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, whether o’er the seas or earth he flies,"
3698,THE ARGUMENT.,With rapid force they bear him down the skies.
3699,THE ARGUMENT.,But first he grasps within his awful hand
3700,THE ARGUMENT.,"The mark of sov’reign pow’r, his magic wand;"
3701,THE ARGUMENT.,With this he draws the ghosts from hollow graves;
3702,THE ARGUMENT.,With this he drives them down the Stygian waves;
3703,THE ARGUMENT.,"With this he seals in sleep the wakeful sight,"
3704,THE ARGUMENT.,"And eyes, tho’ clos’d in death, restores to light."
3705,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus arm’d, the god begins his airy race,"
3706,THE ARGUMENT.,And drives the racking clouds along the liquid space;
3707,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now sees the tops of Atlas, as he flies,"
3708,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose brawny back supports the starry skies;
3709,THE ARGUMENT.,"Atlas, whose head, with piny forests crown’d,"
3710,THE ARGUMENT.,"Is beaten by the winds, with foggy vapours bound."
3711,THE ARGUMENT.,Snows hide his shoulders; from beneath his chin
3712,THE ARGUMENT.,The founts of rolling streams their race begin;
3713,THE ARGUMENT.,A beard of ice on his large breast depends.
3714,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here, pois’d upon his wings, the god descends:"
3715,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, rested thus, he from the tow’ring height"
3716,THE ARGUMENT.,"Plung’d downward, with precipitated flight,"
3717,THE ARGUMENT.,"Lights on the seas, and skims along the flood."
3718,THE ARGUMENT.,"As waterfowl, who seek their fishy food,"
3719,THE ARGUMENT.,"Less, and yet less, to distant prospect show;"
3720,THE ARGUMENT.,"By turns they dance aloft, and dive below:"
3721,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like these, the steerage of his wings he plies,"
3722,THE ARGUMENT.,"And near the surface of the water flies,"
3723,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till, having pass’d the seas, and cross’d the sands,"
3724,THE ARGUMENT.,"He clos’d his wings, and stoop’d on Libyan lands:"
3725,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where shepherds once were hous’d in homely sheds,"
3726,THE ARGUMENT.,Now tow’rs within the clouds advance their heads.
3727,THE ARGUMENT.,"Arriving there, he found the Trojan prince"
3728,THE ARGUMENT.,New ramparts raising for the town’s defence.
3729,THE ARGUMENT.,"A purple scarf, with gold embroider’d o’er,"
3730,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Queen Dido’s gift,) about his waist he wore;"
3731,THE ARGUMENT.,"A sword, with glitt’ring gems diversified,"
3732,THE ARGUMENT.,"For ornament, not use, hung idly by his side."
3733,THE ARGUMENT.,
3734,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then thus, with winged words, the god began,"
3735,THE ARGUMENT.,"Resuming his own shape: “Degenerate man,"
3736,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thou woman’s property, what mak’st thou here,"
3737,THE ARGUMENT.,"These foreign walls and Tyrian tow’rs to rear,"
3738,THE ARGUMENT.,"Forgetful of thy own? All-pow’rful Jove,"
3739,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who sways the world below and heav’n above,"
3740,THE ARGUMENT.,Has sent me down with this severe command:
3741,THE ARGUMENT.,What means thy ling’ring in the Libyan land?
3742,THE ARGUMENT.,"If glory cannot move a mind so mean,"
3743,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor future praise from flitting pleasure wean,"
3744,THE ARGUMENT.,Regard the fortunes of thy rising heir:
3745,THE ARGUMENT.,"The promis’d crown let young Ascanius wear,"
3746,THE ARGUMENT.,"To whom th’ Ausonian scepter, and the state"
3747,THE ARGUMENT.,Of Rome’s imperial name is ow’d by fate.”
3748,THE ARGUMENT.,"So spoke the god; and, speaking, took his flight,"
3749,THE ARGUMENT.,"Involv’d in clouds, and vanish’d out of sight."
3750,THE ARGUMENT.,
3751,THE ARGUMENT.,The pious prince was seiz’d with sudden fear;
3752,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mute was his tongue, and upright stood his hair."
3753,THE ARGUMENT.,"Revolving in his mind the stern command,"
3754,THE ARGUMENT.,"He longs to fly, and loathes the charming land."
3755,THE ARGUMENT.,What should he say? or how should he begin?
3756,THE ARGUMENT.,"What course, alas! remains to steer between"
3757,THE ARGUMENT.,Th’ offended lover and the pow’rful queen?
3758,THE ARGUMENT.,"This way and that he turns his anxious mind,"
3759,THE ARGUMENT.,"And all expedients tries, and none can find."
3760,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fix’d on the deed, but doubtful of the means,"
3761,THE ARGUMENT.,"After long thought, to this advice he leans:"
3762,THE ARGUMENT.,"Three chiefs he calls, commands them to repair"
3763,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fleet, and ship their men with silent care;"
3764,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some plausible pretence he bids them find,"
3765,THE ARGUMENT.,To colour what in secret he design’d.
3766,THE ARGUMENT.,"Himself, meantime, the softest hours would choose,"
3767,THE ARGUMENT.,Before the love-sick lady heard the news;
3768,THE ARGUMENT.,"And move her tender mind, by slow degrees,"
3769,THE ARGUMENT.,To suffer what the sov’reign pow’r decrees:
3770,THE ARGUMENT.,"Jove will inspire him, when, and what to say."
3771,THE ARGUMENT.,"They hear with pleasure, and with haste obey."
3772,THE ARGUMENT.,
3773,THE ARGUMENT.,But soon the queen perceives the thin disguise:
3774,THE ARGUMENT.,(What arts can blind a jealous woman’s eyes!)
3775,THE ARGUMENT.,"She was the first to find the secret fraud,"
3776,THE ARGUMENT.,Before the fatal news was blaz’d abroad.
3777,THE ARGUMENT.,"Love the first motions of the lover hears,"
3778,THE ARGUMENT.,"Quick to presage, and ev’n in safety fears."
3779,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor impious Fame was wanting to report
3780,THE ARGUMENT.,"The ships repair’d, the Trojans’ thick resort,"
3781,THE ARGUMENT.,And purpose to forsake the Tyrian court.
3782,THE ARGUMENT.,"Frantic with fear, impatient of the wound,"
3783,THE ARGUMENT.,"And impotent of mind, she roves the city round."
3784,THE ARGUMENT.,"Less wild the Bacchanalian dames appear,"
3785,THE ARGUMENT.,"When, from afar, their nightly god they hear,"
3786,THE ARGUMENT.,"And howl about the hills, and shake the wreathy spear."
3787,THE ARGUMENT.,At length she finds the dear perfidious man;
3788,THE ARGUMENT.,"Prevents his form’d excuse, and thus began:"
3789,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Base and ungrateful! could you hope to fly,"
3790,THE ARGUMENT.,And undiscover’d scape a lover’s eye?
3791,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor could my kindness your compassion move.
3792,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor plighted vows, nor dearer bands of love?"
3793,THE ARGUMENT.,Or is the death of a despairing queen
3794,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not worth preventing, tho’ too well foreseen?"
3795,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ev’n when the wintry winds command your stay,"
3796,THE ARGUMENT.,"You dare the tempests, and defy the sea."
3797,THE ARGUMENT.,"False as you are, suppose you were not bound"
3798,THE ARGUMENT.,"To lands unknown, and foreign coasts to sound;"
3799,THE ARGUMENT.,"Were Troy restor’d, and Priam’s happy reign,"
3800,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now durst you tempt, for Troy, the raging main?"
3801,THE ARGUMENT.,See whom you fly! am I the foe you shun?
3802,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, by those holy vows, so late begun,"
3803,THE ARGUMENT.,"By this right hand, (since I have nothing more"
3804,THE ARGUMENT.,"To challenge, but the faith you gave before;)"
3805,THE ARGUMENT.,"I beg you by these tears too truly shed,"
3806,THE ARGUMENT.,By the new pleasures of our nuptial bed;
3807,THE ARGUMENT.,"If ever Dido, when you most were kind,"
3808,THE ARGUMENT.,"Were pleasing in your eyes, or touch’d your mind;"
3809,THE ARGUMENT.,"By these my pray’rs, if pray’rs may yet have place,"
3810,THE ARGUMENT.,Pity the fortunes of a falling race.
3811,THE ARGUMENT.,"For you I have provok’d a tyrant’s hate,"
3812,THE ARGUMENT.,Incens’d the Libyan and the Tyrian state;
3813,THE ARGUMENT.,"For you alone I suffer in my fame,"
3814,THE ARGUMENT.,"Bereft of honour, and expos’d to shame."
3815,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whom have I now to trust, ungrateful guest?"
3816,THE ARGUMENT.,(That only name remains of all the rest!)
3817,THE ARGUMENT.,What have I left? or whither can I fly?
3818,THE ARGUMENT.,"Must I attend Pygmalion’s cruelty,"
3819,THE ARGUMENT.,Or till Hyarba shall in triumph lead
3820,THE ARGUMENT.,A queen that proudly scorn’d his proffer’d bed?
3821,THE ARGUMENT.,"Had you deferr’d, at least, your hasty flight,"
3822,THE ARGUMENT.,"And left behind some pledge of our delight,"
3823,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some babe to bless the mother’s mournful sight,"
3824,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some young Aeneas, to supply your place,"
3825,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose features might express his father’s face;
3826,THE ARGUMENT.,I should not then complain to live bereft
3827,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of all my husband, or be wholly left.”"
3828,THE ARGUMENT.,
3829,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here paus’d the queen. Unmov’d he holds his eyes,"
3830,THE ARGUMENT.,"By Jove’s command; nor suffer’d love to rise,"
3831,THE ARGUMENT.,Tho’ heaving in his heart; and thus at length replies:
3832,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Fair queen, you never can enough repeat"
3833,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your boundless favours, or I own my debt;"
3834,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor can my mind forget Eliza’s name,"
3835,THE ARGUMENT.,While vital breath inspires this mortal frame.
3836,THE ARGUMENT.,This only let me speak in my defence:
3837,THE ARGUMENT.,"I never hop’d a secret flight from hence,"
3838,THE ARGUMENT.,Much less pretended to the lawful claim
3839,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of sacred nuptials, or a husband’s name."
3840,THE ARGUMENT.,"For, if indulgent Heav’n would leave me free,"
3841,THE ARGUMENT.,"And not submit my life to fate’s decree,"
3842,THE ARGUMENT.,"My choice would lead me to the Trojan shore,"
3843,THE ARGUMENT.,"Those relics to review, their dust adore,"
3844,THE ARGUMENT.,And Priam’s ruin’d palace to restore.
3845,THE ARGUMENT.,"But now the Delphian oracle commands,"
3846,THE ARGUMENT.,And fate invites me to the Latian lands.
3847,THE ARGUMENT.,"That is the promis’d place to which I steer,"
3848,THE ARGUMENT.,And all my vows are terminated there.
3849,THE ARGUMENT.,"If you, a Tyrian, and a stranger born,"
3850,THE ARGUMENT.,"With walls and tow’rs a Libyan town adorn,"
3851,THE ARGUMENT.,"Why may not we, like you, a foreign race,"
3852,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like you, seek shelter in a foreign place?"
3853,THE ARGUMENT.,As often as the night obscures the skies
3854,THE ARGUMENT.,"With humid shades, or twinkling stars arise,"
3855,THE ARGUMENT.,"Anchises’ angry ghost in dreams appears,"
3856,THE ARGUMENT.,"Chides my delay, and fills my soul with fears;"
3857,THE ARGUMENT.,And young Ascanius justly may complain
3858,THE ARGUMENT.,Of his defrauded and destin’d reign.
3859,THE ARGUMENT.,Ev’n now the herald of the gods appear’d:
3860,THE ARGUMENT.,"Waking I saw him, and his message heard."
3861,THE ARGUMENT.,"From Jove he came commission’d, heav’nly bright"
3862,THE ARGUMENT.,"With radiant beams, and manifest to sight"
3863,THE ARGUMENT.,(The sender and the sent I both attest)
3864,THE ARGUMENT.,"These walls he enter’d, and those words express’d."
3865,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fair queen, oppose not what the gods command;"
3866,THE ARGUMENT.,"Forc’d by my fate, I leave your happy land.”"
3867,THE ARGUMENT.,
3868,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus while he spoke, already she began,"
3869,THE ARGUMENT.,"With sparkling eyes, to view the guilty man;"
3870,THE ARGUMENT.,"From head to foot survey’d his person o’er,"
3871,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor longer these outrageous threats forebore:
3872,THE ARGUMENT.,"“False as thou art, and, more than false, forsworn!"
3873,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not sprung from noble blood, nor goddess-born,"
3874,THE ARGUMENT.,But hewn from harden’d entrails of a rock!
3875,THE ARGUMENT.,And rough Hyrcanian tigers gave thee suck!
3876,THE ARGUMENT.,Why should I fawn? what have I worse to fear?
3877,THE ARGUMENT.,"Did he once look, or lent a list’ning ear,"
3878,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sigh’d when I sobb’d, or shed one kindly tear?"
3879,THE ARGUMENT.,"All symptoms of a base ungrateful mind,"
3880,THE ARGUMENT.,"So foul, that, which is worse, ’tis hard to find."
3881,THE ARGUMENT.,Of man’s injustice why should I complain?
3882,THE ARGUMENT.,"The gods, and Jove himself, behold in vain"
3883,THE ARGUMENT.,"Triumphant treason; yet no thunder flies,"
3884,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor Juno views my wrongs with equal eyes;
3885,THE ARGUMENT.,"Faithless is earth, and faithless are the skies!"
3886,THE ARGUMENT.,"Justice is fled, and Truth is now no more!"
3887,THE ARGUMENT.,I sav’d the shipwreck’d exile on my shore;
3888,THE ARGUMENT.,With needful food his hungry Trojans fed;
3889,THE ARGUMENT.,I took the traitor to my throne and bed:
3890,THE ARGUMENT.,Fool that I was—— ’tis little to repeat
3891,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rest, I stor’d and rigg’d his ruin’d fleet."
3892,THE ARGUMENT.,"I rave, I rave! A god’s command he pleads,"
3893,THE ARGUMENT.,And makes Heav’n accessary to his deeds.
3894,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now Lycian lots, and now the Delian god,"
3895,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now Hermes is employ’d from Jove’s abode,"
3896,THE ARGUMENT.,To warn him hence; as if the peaceful state
3897,THE ARGUMENT.,Of heav’nly pow’rs were touch’d with human fate!
3898,THE ARGUMENT.,But go! thy flight no longer I detain;
3899,THE ARGUMENT.,Go seek thy promis’d kingdom thro’ the main!
3900,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet, if the heav’ns will hear my pious vow,"
3901,THE ARGUMENT.,"The faithless waves, not half so false as thou,"
3902,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or secret sands, shall sepulchers afford"
3903,THE ARGUMENT.,"To thy proud vessels, and their perjur’d lord."
3904,THE ARGUMENT.,Then shalt thou call on injur’d Dido’s name:
3905,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dido shall come in a black sulph’ry flame,"
3906,THE ARGUMENT.,When death has once dissolv’d her mortal frame;
3907,THE ARGUMENT.,Shall smile to see the traitor vainly weep:
3908,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her angry ghost, arising from the deep,"
3909,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shall haunt thee waking, and disturb thy sleep."
3910,THE ARGUMENT.,"At least my shade thy punishment shall know,"
3911,THE ARGUMENT.,And Fame shall spread the pleasing news below.”
3912,THE ARGUMENT.,
3913,THE ARGUMENT.,Abruptly here she stops; then turns away
3914,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her loathing eyes, and shuns the sight of day."
3915,THE ARGUMENT.,"Amaz’d he stood, revolving in his mind"
3916,THE ARGUMENT.,"What speech to frame, and what excuse to find."
3917,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her fearful maids their fainting mistress led,"
3918,THE ARGUMENT.,And softly laid her on her ivory bed.
3919,THE ARGUMENT.,
3920,THE ARGUMENT.,"But good Aeneas, tho’ he much desir’d"
3921,THE ARGUMENT.,To give that pity which her grief requir’d;
3922,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tho’ much he mourn’d, and labour’d with his love,"
3923,THE ARGUMENT.,"Resolv’d at length, obeys the will of Jove;"
3924,THE ARGUMENT.,Reviews his forces: they with early care
3925,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unmoor their vessels, and for sea prepare."
3926,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fleet is soon afloat, in all its pride,"
3927,THE ARGUMENT.,And well-calk’d galleys in the harbour ride.
3928,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then oaks for oars they fell’d; or, as they stood,"
3929,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of its green arms despoil’d the growing wood,"
3930,THE ARGUMENT.,Studious of flight. The beach is cover’d o’er
3931,THE ARGUMENT.,"With Trojan bands, that blacken all the shore:"
3932,THE ARGUMENT.,"On ev’ry side are seen, descending down,"
3933,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thick swarms of soldiers, loaden from the town."
3934,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus, in battalia, march embodied ants,"
3935,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fearful of winter, and of future wants,"
3936,THE ARGUMENT.,"T’ invade the corn, and to their cells convey"
3937,THE ARGUMENT.,The plunder’d forage of their yellow prey.
3938,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sable troops, along the narrow tracks,"
3939,THE ARGUMENT.,Scarce bear the weighty burthen on their backs:
3940,THE ARGUMENT.,Some set their shoulders to the pond’rous grain;
3941,THE ARGUMENT.,Some guard the spoil; some lash the lagging train;
3942,THE ARGUMENT.,"All ply their sev’ral tasks, and equal toil sustain."
3943,THE ARGUMENT.,
3944,THE ARGUMENT.,"What pangs the tender breast of Dido tore,"
3945,THE ARGUMENT.,"When, from the tow’r, she saw the cover’d shore,"
3946,THE ARGUMENT.,"And heard the shouts of sailors from afar,"
3947,THE ARGUMENT.,Mix’d with the murmurs of the wat’ry war!
3948,THE ARGUMENT.,All-pow’rful Love! what changes canst thou cause
3949,THE ARGUMENT.,"In human hearts, subjected to thy laws!"
3950,THE ARGUMENT.,Once more her haughty soul the tyrant bends:
3951,THE ARGUMENT.,To pray’rs and mean submissions she descends.
3952,THE ARGUMENT.,"No female arts or aids she left untried,"
3953,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor counsels unexplor’d, before she died."
3954,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Look, Anna! look! the Trojans crowd to sea;"
3955,THE ARGUMENT.,"They spread their canvas, and their anchors weigh."
3956,THE ARGUMENT.,"The shouting crew their ships with garlands bind,"
3957,THE ARGUMENT.,"Invoke the sea gods, and invite the wind."
3958,THE ARGUMENT.,"Could I have thought this threat’ning blow so near,"
3959,THE ARGUMENT.,My tender soul had been forewarn’d to bear.
3960,THE ARGUMENT.,But do not you my last request deny;
3961,THE ARGUMENT.,"With yon perfidious man your int’rest try,"
3962,THE ARGUMENT.,"And bring me news, if I must live or die."
3963,THE ARGUMENT.,You are his fav’rite; you alone can find
3964,THE ARGUMENT.,The dark recesses of his inmost mind:
3965,THE ARGUMENT.,"In all his trusted secrets you have part,"
3966,THE ARGUMENT.,And know the soft approaches to his heart.
3967,THE ARGUMENT.,"Haste then, and humbly seek my haughty foe;"
3968,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tell him, I did not with the Grecians go,"
3969,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor did my fleet against his friends employ,"
3970,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor swore the ruin of unhappy Troy,"
3971,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor mov’d with hands profane his father’s dust:
3972,THE ARGUMENT.,Why should he then reject a suit so just!
3973,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whom does he shun, and whither would he fly!"
3974,THE ARGUMENT.,"Can he this last, this only pray’r deny!"
3975,THE ARGUMENT.,"Let him at least his dang’rous flight delay,"
3976,THE ARGUMENT.,"Wait better winds, and hope a calmer sea."
3977,THE ARGUMENT.,The nuptials he disclaims I urge no more:
3978,THE ARGUMENT.,Let him pursue the promis’d Latian shore.
3979,THE ARGUMENT.,A short delay is all I ask him now;
3980,THE ARGUMENT.,"A pause of grief, an interval from woe,"
3981,THE ARGUMENT.,Till my soft soul be temper’d to sustain
3982,THE ARGUMENT.,"Accustom’d sorrows, and inur’d to pain."
3983,THE ARGUMENT.,"If you in pity grant this one request,"
3984,THE ARGUMENT.,My death shall glut the hatred of his breast.”
3985,THE ARGUMENT.,"This mournful message pious Anna bears,"
3986,THE ARGUMENT.,And seconds with her own her sister’s tears:
3987,THE ARGUMENT.,But all her arts are still employ’d in vain;
3988,THE ARGUMENT.,"Again she comes, and is refus’d again."
3989,THE ARGUMENT.,His harden’d heart nor pray’rs nor threat’nings move;
3990,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fate, and the god, had stopp’d his ears to love."
3991,THE ARGUMENT.,
3992,THE ARGUMENT.,"As, when the winds their airy quarrel try,"
3993,THE ARGUMENT.,"Justling from ev’ry quarter of the sky,"
3994,THE ARGUMENT.,"This way and that the mountain oak they bend,"
3995,THE ARGUMENT.,"His boughs they shatter, and his branches rend;"
3996,THE ARGUMENT.,With leaves and falling mast they spread the ground;
3997,THE ARGUMENT.,The hollow valleys echo to the sound:
3998,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unmov’d, the royal plant their fury mocks,"
3999,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or, shaken, clings more closely to the rocks;"
4000,THE ARGUMENT.,"Far as he shoots his tow’ring head on high,"
4001,THE ARGUMENT.,So deep in earth his fix’d foundations lie.
4002,THE ARGUMENT.,No less a storm the Trojan hero bears;
4003,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thick messages and loud complaints he hears,"
4004,THE ARGUMENT.,"And bandied words, still beating on his ears."
4005,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sighs, groans, and tears proclaim his inward pains;"
4006,THE ARGUMENT.,But the firm purpose of his heart remains.
4007,THE ARGUMENT.,
4008,THE ARGUMENT.,"The wretched queen, pursued by cruel fate,"
4009,THE ARGUMENT.,"Begins at length the light of heav’n to hate,"
4010,THE ARGUMENT.,"And loathes to live. Then dire portents she sees,"
4011,THE ARGUMENT.,To hasten on the death her soul decrees:
4012,THE ARGUMENT.,"Strange to relate! for when, before the shrine,"
4013,THE ARGUMENT.,"She pours in sacrifice the purple wine,"
4014,THE ARGUMENT.,"The purple wine is turn’d to putrid blood,"
4015,THE ARGUMENT.,And the white offer’d milk converts to mud.
4016,THE ARGUMENT.,"This dire presage, to her alone reveal’d,"
4017,THE ARGUMENT.,"From all, and ev’n her sister, she conceal’d."
4018,THE ARGUMENT.,"A marble temple stood within the grove,"
4019,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sacred to death, and to her murder’d love;"
4020,THE ARGUMENT.,That honour’d chapel she had hung around
4021,THE ARGUMENT.,"With snowy fleeces, and with garlands crown’d:"
4022,THE ARGUMENT.,"Oft, when she visited this lonely dome,"
4023,THE ARGUMENT.,Strange voices issued from her husband’s tomb;
4024,THE ARGUMENT.,"She thought she heard him summon her away,"
4025,THE ARGUMENT.,"Invite her to his grave, and chide her stay."
4026,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hourly ’tis heard, when with a boding note"
4027,THE ARGUMENT.,"The solitary screech owl strains her throat,"
4028,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, on a chimney’s top, or turret’s height,"
4029,THE ARGUMENT.,With songs obscene disturbs the silence of the night.
4030,THE ARGUMENT.,"Besides, old prophecies augment her fears;"
4031,THE ARGUMENT.,"And stern Aeneas in her dreams appears,"
4032,THE ARGUMENT.,"Disdainful as by day: she seems, alone,"
4033,THE ARGUMENT.,"To wander in her sleep, thro’ ways unknown,"
4034,THE ARGUMENT.,"Guideless and dark; or, in a desert plain,"
4035,THE ARGUMENT.,"To seek her subjects, and to seek in vain:"
4036,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like Pentheus, when, distracted with his fear,"
4037,THE ARGUMENT.,"He saw two suns, and double Thebes, appear;"
4038,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or mad Orestes, when his mother’s ghost"
4039,THE ARGUMENT.,"Full in his face infernal torches toss’d,"
4040,THE ARGUMENT.,"And shook her snaky locks: he shuns the sight,"
4041,THE ARGUMENT.,"Flies o’er the stage, surpris’d with mortal fright;"
4042,THE ARGUMENT.,The Furies guard the door and intercept his flight.
4043,THE ARGUMENT.,
4044,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, sinking underneath a load of grief,"
4045,THE ARGUMENT.,From death alone she seeks her last relief;
4046,THE ARGUMENT.,"The time and means resolv’d within her breast,"
4047,THE ARGUMENT.,She to her mournful sister thus address’d
4048,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Dissembling hope, her cloudy front she clears,"
4049,THE ARGUMENT.,And a false vigour in her eyes appears):
4050,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Rejoice!” she said. “Instructed from above,"
4051,THE ARGUMENT.,"My lover I shall gain, or lose my love."
4052,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nigh rising Atlas, next the falling sun,"
4053,THE ARGUMENT.,Long tracts of Ethiopian climates run:
4054,THE ARGUMENT.,"There a Massylian priestess I have found,"
4055,THE ARGUMENT.,"Honour’d for age, for magic arts renown’d:"
4056,THE ARGUMENT.,Th’ Hesperian temple was her trusted care;
4057,THE ARGUMENT.,’Twas she supplied the wakeful dragon’s fare.
4058,THE ARGUMENT.,"She poppy seeds in honey taught to steep,"
4059,THE ARGUMENT.,"Reclaim’d his rage, and sooth’d him into sleep."
4060,THE ARGUMENT.,She watch’d the golden fruit; her charms unbind
4061,THE ARGUMENT.,"The chains of love, or fix them on the mind:"
4062,THE ARGUMENT.,"She stops the torrents, leaves the channel dry,"
4063,THE ARGUMENT.,"Repels the stars, and backward bears the sky."
4064,THE ARGUMENT.,"The yawning earth rebellows to her call,"
4065,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pale ghosts ascend, and mountain ashes fall."
4066,THE ARGUMENT.,"Witness, ye gods, and thou my better part,"
4067,THE ARGUMENT.,How loth I am to try this impious art!
4068,THE ARGUMENT.,"Within the secret court, with silent care,"
4069,THE ARGUMENT.,"Erect a lofty pile, expos’d in air:"
4070,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hang on the topmost part the Trojan vest,"
4071,THE ARGUMENT.,"Spoils, arms, and presents, of my faithless guest."
4072,THE ARGUMENT.,"Next, under these, the bridal bed be plac’d,"
4073,THE ARGUMENT.,Where I my ruin in his arms embrac’d:
4074,THE ARGUMENT.,All relics of the wretch are doom’d to fire;
4075,THE ARGUMENT.,For so the priestess and her charms require.”
4076,THE ARGUMENT.,
4077,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus far she said, and farther speech forbears;"
4078,THE ARGUMENT.,A mortal paleness in her face appears:
4079,THE ARGUMENT.,Yet the mistrustless Anna could not find
4080,THE ARGUMENT.,The secret fun’ral in these rites design’d;
4081,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor thought so dire a rage possess’d her mind.
4082,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unknowing of a train conceal’d so well,"
4083,THE ARGUMENT.,She fear’d no worse than when Sichaeus fell;
4084,THE ARGUMENT.,"Therefore obeys. The fatal pile they rear,"
4085,THE ARGUMENT.,"Within the secret court, expos’d in air."
4086,THE ARGUMENT.,"The cloven holms and pines are heap’d on high,"
4087,THE ARGUMENT.,And garlands on the hollow spaces lie.
4088,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sad cypress, vervain, yew, compose the wreath,"
4089,THE ARGUMENT.,And ev’ry baleful green denoting death.
4090,THE ARGUMENT.,"The queen, determin’d to the fatal deed,"
4091,THE ARGUMENT.,"The spoils and sword he left, in order spread,"
4092,THE ARGUMENT.,And the man’s image on the nuptial bed.
4093,THE ARGUMENT.,
4094,THE ARGUMENT.,And now (the sacred altars plac’d around)
4095,THE ARGUMENT.,"The priestess enters, with her hair unbound,"
4096,THE ARGUMENT.,And thrice invokes the pow’rs below the ground.
4097,THE ARGUMENT.,"Night, Erebus, and Chaos she proclaims,"
4098,THE ARGUMENT.,"And threefold Hecate, with her hundred names,"
4099,THE ARGUMENT.,"And three Dianas: next, she sprinkles round"
4100,THE ARGUMENT.,With feign’d Avernian drops the hallow’d ground;
4101,THE ARGUMENT.,"Culls hoary simples, found by Phoebe’s light,"
4102,THE ARGUMENT.,With brazen sickles reap’d at noon of night;
4103,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then mixes baleful juices in the bowl,"
4104,THE ARGUMENT.,"And cuts the forehead of a newborn foal,"
4105,THE ARGUMENT.,Robbing the mother’s love. The destin’d queen
4106,THE ARGUMENT.,"Observes, assisting at the rites obscene;"
4107,THE ARGUMENT.,A leaven’d cake in her devoted hands
4108,THE ARGUMENT.,"She holds, and next the highest altar stands:"
4109,THE ARGUMENT.,"One tender foot was shod, her other bare;"
4110,THE ARGUMENT.,"Girt was her gather’d gown, and loose her hair."
4111,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus dress’d, she summon’d, with her dying breath,"
4112,THE ARGUMENT.,"The heav’ns and planets conscious of her death,"
4113,THE ARGUMENT.,"And ev’ry pow’r, if any rules above,"
4114,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who minds, or who revenges, injur’d love."
4115,THE ARGUMENT.,
4116,THE ARGUMENT.,"“’Twas dead of night, when weary bodies close"
4117,THE ARGUMENT.,Their eyes in balmy sleep and soft repose:
4118,THE ARGUMENT.,"The winds no longer whisper thro’ the woods,"
4119,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor murm’ring tides disturb the gentle floods.
4120,THE ARGUMENT.,The stars in silent order mov’d around;
4121,THE ARGUMENT.,"And Peace, with downy wings, was brooding on the ground"
4122,THE ARGUMENT.,"The flocks and herds, and party-colour’d fowl,"
4123,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which haunt the woods, or swim the weedy pool,"
4124,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stretch’d on the quiet earth, securely lay,"
4125,THE ARGUMENT.,Forgetting the past labours of the day.
4126,THE ARGUMENT.,All else of nature’s common gift partake:
4127,THE ARGUMENT.,Unhappy Dido was alone awake.
4128,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor sleep nor ease the furious queen can find;
4129,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sleep fled her eyes, as quiet fled her mind."
4130,THE ARGUMENT.,"Despair, and rage, and love divide her heart;"
4131,THE ARGUMENT.,"Despair and rage had some, but love the greater part."
4132,THE ARGUMENT.,
4133,THE ARGUMENT.,Then thus she said within her secret mind:
4134,THE ARGUMENT.,“What shall I do? what succour can I find?
4135,THE ARGUMENT.,"Become a suppliant to Hyarba’s pride,"
4136,THE ARGUMENT.,"And take my turn, to court and be denied?"
4137,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shall I with this ungrateful Trojan go,"
4138,THE ARGUMENT.,"Forsake an empire, and attend a foe?"
4139,THE ARGUMENT.,"Himself I refug’d, and his train reliev’d;"
4140,THE ARGUMENT.,’Tis true; but am I sure to be receiv’d?
4141,THE ARGUMENT.,Can gratitude in Trojan souls have place!
4142,THE ARGUMENT.,Laomedon still lives in all his race!
4143,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, shall I seek alone the churlish crew,"
4144,THE ARGUMENT.,Or with my fleet their flying sails pursue?
4145,THE ARGUMENT.,What force have I but those whom scarce before
4146,THE ARGUMENT.,I drew reluctant from their native shore?
4147,THE ARGUMENT.,"Will they again embark at my desire,"
4148,THE ARGUMENT.,"Once more sustain the seas, and quit their second Tyre?"
4149,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rather with steel thy guilty breast invade,"
4150,THE ARGUMENT.,And take the fortune thou thyself hast made.
4151,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your pity, sister, first seduc’d my mind,"
4152,THE ARGUMENT.,Or seconded too well what I design’d.
4153,THE ARGUMENT.,"These dear-bought pleasures had I never known,"
4154,THE ARGUMENT.,"Had I continued free, and still my own;"
4155,THE ARGUMENT.,"Avoiding love, I had not found despair,"
4156,THE ARGUMENT.,But shar’d with salvage beasts the common air.
4157,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like them, a lonely life I might have led,"
4158,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not mourn’d the living, nor disturb’d the dead.”"
4159,THE ARGUMENT.,These thoughts she brooded in her anxious breast.
4160,THE ARGUMENT.,"On board, the Trojan found more easy rest."
4161,THE ARGUMENT.,"Resolv’d to sail, in sleep he pass’d the night;"
4162,THE ARGUMENT.,And order’d all things for his early flight.
4163,THE ARGUMENT.,
4164,THE ARGUMENT.,To whom once more the winged god appears;
4165,THE ARGUMENT.,"His former youthful mien and shape he wears,"
4166,THE ARGUMENT.,And with this new alarm invades his ears:
4167,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Sleep’st thou, O goddess-born! and canst thou drown"
4168,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy needful cares, so near a hostile town,"
4169,THE ARGUMENT.,Beset with foes; nor hear’st the western gales
4170,THE ARGUMENT.,"Invite thy passage, and inspire thy sails?"
4171,THE ARGUMENT.,"She harbours in her heart a furious hate,"
4172,THE ARGUMENT.,And thou shalt find the dire effects too late;
4173,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fix’d on revenge, and obstinate to die."
4174,THE ARGUMENT.,"Haste swiftly hence, while thou hast pow’r to fly."
4175,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sea with ships will soon be cover’d o’er,"
4176,THE ARGUMENT.,And blazing firebrands kindle all the shore.
4177,THE ARGUMENT.,"Prevent her rage, while night obscures the skies,"
4178,THE ARGUMENT.,And sail before the purple morn arise.
4179,THE ARGUMENT.,Who knows what hazards thy delay may bring?
4180,THE ARGUMENT.,Woman’s a various and a changeful thing.”
4181,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus Hermes in the dream; then took his flight
4182,THE ARGUMENT.,"Aloft in air unseen, and mix’d with night."
4183,THE ARGUMENT.,
4184,THE ARGUMENT.,"Twice warn’d by the celestial messenger,"
4185,THE ARGUMENT.,The pious prince arose with hasty fear;
4186,THE ARGUMENT.,Then rous’d his drowsy train without delay:
4187,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Haste to your banks; your crooked anchors weigh,"
4188,THE ARGUMENT.,"And spread your flying sails, and stand to sea."
4189,THE ARGUMENT.,"A god commands: he stood before my sight,"
4190,THE ARGUMENT.,And urg’d us once again to speedy flight.
4191,THE ARGUMENT.,"O sacred pow’r, what pow’r soe’er thou art,"
4192,THE ARGUMENT.,To thy blest orders I resign my heart.
4193,THE ARGUMENT.,"Lead thou the way; protect thy Trojan bands,"
4194,THE ARGUMENT.,And prosper the design thy will commands.”
4195,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said: and, drawing forth his flaming sword,"
4196,THE ARGUMENT.,His thund’ring arm divides the many-twisted cord.
4197,THE ARGUMENT.,An emulating zeal inspires his train:
4198,THE ARGUMENT.,They run; they snatch; they rush into the main.
4199,THE ARGUMENT.,"With headlong haste they leave the desert shores,"
4200,THE ARGUMENT.,And brush the liquid seas with lab’ring oars.
4201,THE ARGUMENT.,
4202,THE ARGUMENT.,"Aurora now had left her saffron bed,"
4203,THE ARGUMENT.,"And beams of early light the heav’ns o’erspread,"
4204,THE ARGUMENT.,"When, from a tow’r, the queen, with wakeful eyes,"
4205,THE ARGUMENT.,Saw day point upward from the rosy skies.
4206,THE ARGUMENT.,"She look’d to seaward; but the sea was void,"
4207,THE ARGUMENT.,And scarce in ken the sailing ships descried.
4208,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stung with despite, and furious with despair,"
4209,THE ARGUMENT.,"She struck her trembling breast, and tore her hair."
4210,THE ARGUMENT.,"“And shall th’ ungrateful traitor go,” she said,"
4211,THE ARGUMENT.,"“My land forsaken, and my love betray’d?"
4212,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shall we not arm? not rush from ev’ry street,"
4213,THE ARGUMENT.,"To follow, sink, and burn his perjur’d fleet?"
4214,THE ARGUMENT.,"Haste, haul my galleys out! pursue the foe!"
4215,THE ARGUMENT.,"Bring flaming brands! set sail, and swiftly row!"
4216,THE ARGUMENT.,What have I said? where am I? Fury turns
4217,THE ARGUMENT.,My brain; and my distemper’d bosom burns.
4218,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, when I gave my person and my throne,"
4219,THE ARGUMENT.,"This hate, this rage, had been more timely shown."
4220,THE ARGUMENT.,"See now the promis’d faith, the vaunted name,"
4221,THE ARGUMENT.,"The pious man, who, rushing thro’ the flame,"
4222,THE ARGUMENT.,"Preserv’d his gods, and to the Phrygian shore"
4223,THE ARGUMENT.,The burthen of his feeble father bore!
4224,THE ARGUMENT.,I should have torn him piecemeal; strow’d in floods
4225,THE ARGUMENT.,"His scatter’d limbs, or left expos’d in woods;"
4226,THE ARGUMENT.,"Destroy’d his friends and son; and, from the fire,"
4227,THE ARGUMENT.,Have set the reeking boy before the sire.
4228,THE ARGUMENT.,"Events are doubtful, which on battles wait:"
4229,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet where’s the doubt, to souls secure of fate?"
4230,THE ARGUMENT.,"My Tyrians, at their injur’d queen’s command,"
4231,THE ARGUMENT.,Had toss’d their fires amid the Trojan band;
4232,THE ARGUMENT.,At once extinguish’d all the faithless name;
4233,THE ARGUMENT.,"And I myself, in vengeance of my shame,"
4234,THE ARGUMENT.,"Had fall’n upon the pile, to mend the fun’ral flame."
4235,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thou Sun, who view’st at once the world below;"
4236,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thou Juno, guardian of the nuptial vow;"
4237,THE ARGUMENT.,Thou Hecate hearken from thy dark abodes!
4238,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ye Furies, fiends, and violated gods,"
4239,THE ARGUMENT.,"All pow’rs invok’d with Dido’s dying breath,"

4246,THE ARGUMENT.,"His men discourag’d, and himself expell’d,"
4247,THE ARGUMENT.,"Let him for succour sue from place to place,"
4248,THE ARGUMENT.,"Torn from his subjects, and his son’s embrace."
4249,THE ARGUMENT.,"First, let him see his friends in battle slain,"
4250,THE ARGUMENT.,And their untimely fate lament in vain;
4251,THE ARGUMENT.,"And when, at length, the cruel war shall cease,"
4252,THE ARGUMENT.,On hard conditions may he buy his peace:
4253,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor let him then enjoy supreme command;
4254,THE ARGUMENT.,"But fall, untimely, by some hostile hand,"
4255,THE ARGUMENT.,And lie unburied on the barren sand!
4256,THE ARGUMENT.,"These are my pray’rs, and this my dying will;"
4257,THE ARGUMENT.,"And you, my Tyrians, ev’ry curse fulfil."
4258,THE ARGUMENT.,"Perpetual hate and mortal wars proclaim,"
4259,THE ARGUMENT.,"Against the prince, the people, and the name."
4260,THE ARGUMENT.,These grateful off’rings on my grave bestow;
4261,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor league, nor love, the hostile nations know!"
4262,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, and from hence, in ev’ry future age,"
4263,THE ARGUMENT.,"When rage excites your arms, and strength supplies the rage"
4264,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rise some avenger of our Libyan blood,"

4268,THE ARGUMENT.,
4269,THE ARGUMENT.,"This said, within her anxious mind she weighs"
4270,THE ARGUMENT.,The means of cutting short her odious days.
4271,THE ARGUMENT.,Then to Sichaeus’ nurse she briefly said
4272,THE ARGUMENT.,"(For, when she left her country, hers was dead):"
4273,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Go, Barce, call my sister. Let her care"
4274,THE ARGUMENT.,The solemn rites of sacrifice prepare;
4275,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sheep, and all th’ atoning off’rings bring,"
4276,THE ARGUMENT.,Sprinkling her body from the crystal spring
4277,THE ARGUMENT.,"With living drops; then let her come, and thou"
4278,THE ARGUMENT.,With sacred fillets bind thy hoary brow.
4279,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus will I pay my vows to Stygian Jove,"
4280,THE ARGUMENT.,And end the cares of my disastrous love;
4281,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then cast the Trojan image on the fire,"
4282,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, as that burns, my passions shall expire.”"
4283,THE ARGUMENT.,
4284,THE ARGUMENT.,"The nurse moves onward, with officious care,"
4285,THE ARGUMENT.,And all the speed her aged limbs can bear.
4286,THE ARGUMENT.,"But furious Dido, with dark thoughts involv’d,"
4287,THE ARGUMENT.,Shook at the mighty mischief she resolv’d.
4288,THE ARGUMENT.,With livid spots distinguish’d was her face;
4289,THE ARGUMENT.,"Red were her rolling eyes, and discompos’d her pace;"
4290,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ghastly she gaz’d, with pain she drew her breath,"
4291,THE ARGUMENT.,And nature shiver’d at approaching death.
4292,THE ARGUMENT.,
4293,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then swiftly to the fatal place she pass’d,"
4294,THE ARGUMENT.,And mounts the fun’ral pile with furious haste;
4295,THE ARGUMENT.,Unsheathes the sword the Trojan left behind
4296,THE ARGUMENT.,(Not for so dire an enterprise design’d).
4297,THE ARGUMENT.,"But when she view’d the garments loosely spread,"
4298,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which once he wore, and saw the conscious bed,"
4299,THE ARGUMENT.,"She paus’d, and with a sigh the robes embrac’d;"
4300,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then on the couch her trembling body cast,"
4301,THE ARGUMENT.,"Repress’d the ready tears, and spoke her last:"
4302,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Dear pledges of my love, while Heav’n so pleas’d,"
4303,THE ARGUMENT.,"Receive a soul, of mortal anguish eas’d:"
4304,THE ARGUMENT.,"My fatal course is finish’d; and I go,"
4305,THE ARGUMENT.,"A glorious name, among the ghosts below."
4306,THE ARGUMENT.,"A lofty city by my hands is rais’d,"
4307,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pygmalion punish’d, and my lord appeas’d."
4308,THE ARGUMENT.,"What could my fortune have afforded more,"
4309,THE ARGUMENT.,Had the false Trojan never touch’d my shore!”
4310,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then kiss’d the couch; and, “Must I die,” she said,"
4311,THE ARGUMENT.,“And unreveng’d? ’Tis doubly to be dead!
4312,THE ARGUMENT.,Yet ev’n this death with pleasure I receive:
4313,THE ARGUMENT.,"On any terms, ’tis better than to live."
4314,THE ARGUMENT.,"These flames, from far, may the false Trojan view;"
4315,THE ARGUMENT.,These boding omens his base flight pursue!”
4316,THE ARGUMENT.,
4317,THE ARGUMENT.,"She said, and struck; deep enter’d in her side"
4318,THE ARGUMENT.,"The piercing steel, with reeking purple dyed:"
4319,THE ARGUMENT.,Clogg’d in the wound the cruel weapon stands;
4320,THE ARGUMENT.,The spouting blood came streaming on her hands.
4321,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her sad attendants saw the deadly stroke,"
4322,THE ARGUMENT.,And with loud cries the sounding palace shook.
4323,THE ARGUMENT.,"Distracted, from the fatal sight they fled,"
4324,THE ARGUMENT.,And thro’ the town the dismal rumour spread.
4325,THE ARGUMENT.,First from the frighted court the yell began;
4326,THE ARGUMENT.,"Redoubled, thence from house to house it ran:"
4327,THE ARGUMENT.,"The groans of men, with shrieks, laments, and cries"
4328,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of mixing women, mount the vaulted skies."
4329,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not less the clamour, than if ancient Tyre,"
4330,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or the new Carthage, set by foes on fire,"
4331,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rolling ruin, with their lov’d abodes,"
4332,THE ARGUMENT.,Involv’d the blazing temples of their gods.
4333,THE ARGUMENT.,
4334,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her sister hears; and, furious with despair,"
4335,THE ARGUMENT.,"She beats her breast, and rends her yellow hair,"
4336,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, calling on Eliza’s name aloud,"
4337,THE ARGUMENT.,"Runs breathless to the place, and breaks the crowd."
4338,THE ARGUMENT.,“Was all that pomp of woe for this prepar’d;
4339,THE ARGUMENT.,"These fires, this fun’ral pile, these altars rear’d?"
4340,THE ARGUMENT.,"Was all this train of plots contriv’d,” said she,"
4341,THE ARGUMENT.,“All only to deceive unhappy me?
4342,THE ARGUMENT.,Which is the worst? Didst thou in death pretend
4343,THE ARGUMENT.,"To scorn thy sister, or delude thy friend?"
4344,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy summon’d sister, and thy friend, had come;"
4345,THE ARGUMENT.,"One sword had serv’d us both, one common tomb:"
4346,THE ARGUMENT.,"Was I to raise the pile, the pow’rs invoke,"
4347,THE ARGUMENT.,Not to be present at the fatal stroke?
4348,THE ARGUMENT.,"At once thou hast destroy’d thyself and me,"
4349,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy town, thy senate, and thy colony!"
4350,THE ARGUMENT.,Bring water; bathe the wound; while I in death
4351,THE ARGUMENT.,"Lay close my lips to hers, and catch the flying breath.”"
4352,THE ARGUMENT.,"This said, she mounts the pile with eager haste,"
4353,THE ARGUMENT.,And in her arms the gasping queen embrac’d;
4354,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her temples chaf’d; and her own garments tore,"
4355,THE ARGUMENT.,"To stanch the streaming blood, and cleanse the gore."
4356,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thrice Dido tried to raise her drooping head,"
4357,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, fainting thrice, fell grov’ling on the bed;"
4358,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thrice op’d her heavy eyes, and sought the light,"
4359,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, having found it, sicken’d at the sight,"
4360,THE ARGUMENT.,And clos’d her lids at last in endless night.
4361,THE ARGUMENT.,
4362,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Juno, grieving that she should sustain"
4363,THE ARGUMENT.,"A death so ling’ring, and so full of pain,"
4364,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sent Iris down, to free her from the strife"
4365,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of lab’ring nature, and dissolve her life."
4366,THE ARGUMENT.,"For since she died, not doom’d by Heav’n’s decree,"
4367,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or her own crime, but human casualty,"
4368,THE ARGUMENT.,"And rage of love, that plung’d her in despair,"
4369,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Sisters had not cut the topmost hair,"
4370,THE ARGUMENT.,Which Proserpine and they can only know;
4371,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor made her sacred to the shades below.
4372,THE ARGUMENT.,"Downward the various goddess took her flight,"
4373,THE ARGUMENT.,And drew a thousand colours from the light;
4374,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then stood above the dying lover’s head,"
4375,THE ARGUMENT.,And said: “I thus devote thee to the dead.
4376,THE ARGUMENT.,This off’ring to th’ infernal gods I bear.”
4377,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus while she spoke, she cut the fatal hair:"
4378,THE ARGUMENT.,"The struggling soul was loos’d, and life dissolv’d in air."

4490,THE ARGUMENT.,Light galleys on the seas shall run a wat’ry race;
4491,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some shall in swiftness for the goal contend,"
4492,THE ARGUMENT.,And others try the twanging bow to bend;
4493,THE ARGUMENT.,"The strong, with iron gauntlets arm’d, shall stand"
4494,THE ARGUMENT.,Oppos’d in combat on the yellow sand.
4495,THE ARGUMENT.,"Let all be present at the games prepar’d,"

4503,THE ARGUMENT.,
4504,THE ARGUMENT.,"Aeneas then advanc’d amidst the train,"
4505,THE ARGUMENT.,"By thousands follow’d thro’ the flow’ry plain,"
4506,THE ARGUMENT.,"To great Anchises’ tomb; which when he found,"
4507,THE ARGUMENT.,"He pour’d to Bacchus, on the hallow’d ground,"
4508,THE ARGUMENT.,"Two bowls of sparkling wine, of milk two more,"
4509,THE ARGUMENT.,"And two from offer’d bulls of purple gore,"
4510,THE ARGUMENT.,With roses then the sepulcher he strow’d
4511,THE ARGUMENT.,And thus his father’s ghost bespoke aloud:
4512,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Hail, O ye holy manes! hail again,"
4513,THE ARGUMENT.,"Paternal ashes, now review’d in vain!"
4514,THE ARGUMENT.,"The gods permitted not, that you, with me,"

4516,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or Tiber’s flood, what flood soe’er it be.”"
4517,THE ARGUMENT.,"Scarce had he finish’d, when, with speckled pride,"
4518,THE ARGUMENT.,A serpent from the tomb began to glide;
4519,THE ARGUMENT.,His hugy bulk on sev’n high volumes roll’d;

4521,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus riding on his curls, he seem’d to pass"
4522,THE ARGUMENT.,"A rolling fire along, and singe the grass."
4523,THE ARGUMENT.,"More various colours thro’ his body run,"
4524,THE ARGUMENT.,Than Iris when her bow imbibes the sun.
4525,THE ARGUMENT.,"Betwixt the rising altars, and around,"
4526,THE ARGUMENT.,The sacred monster shot along the ground;
4527,THE ARGUMENT.,"With harmless play amidst the bowls he pass’d,"
4528,THE ARGUMENT.,And with his lolling tongue assay’d the taste:
4529,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus fed with holy food, the wondrous guest"
4530,THE ARGUMENT.,Within the hollow tomb retir’d to rest.
4531,THE ARGUMENT.,"The pious prince, surpris’d at what he view’d,"
4532,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fun’ral honours with more zeal renew’d,"
4533,THE ARGUMENT.,"Doubtful if this place’s genius were,"
4534,THE ARGUMENT.,Or guardian of his father’s sepulcher.
4535,THE ARGUMENT.,"Five sheep, according to the rites, he slew;"
4536,THE ARGUMENT.,"As many swine, and steers of sable hue;"
4537,THE ARGUMENT.,New gen’rous wine he from the goblets pour’d.

4539,THE ARGUMENT.,"The glad attendants in long order come,"
4540,THE ARGUMENT.,Off’ring their gifts at great Anchises’ tomb:
4541,THE ARGUMENT.,Some add more oxen: some divide the spoil;
4542,THE ARGUMENT.,Some place the chargers on the grassy soil;
4543,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some blow the fires, and offered entrails broil."
4544,THE ARGUMENT.,
4545,THE ARGUMENT.,Now came the day desir’d. The skies were bright

4553,THE ARGUMENT.,"Within the circle, arms and tripods lie,"
4554,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ingots of gold and silver, heap’d on high,"
4555,THE ARGUMENT.,"And vests embroider’d, of the Tyrian dye."
4556,THE ARGUMENT.,"The trumpet’s clangour then the feast proclaims,"

4558,THE ARGUMENT.,"Four galleys first, which equal rowers bear,"
4559,THE ARGUMENT.,"Advancing, in the wat’ry lists appear."

4566,THE ARGUMENT.,Beneath their sturdy strokes the billows roar.
4567,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sergesthus, who began the Sergian race,"
4568,THE ARGUMENT.,In the great Centaur took the leading place;

4575,THE ARGUMENT.,"Uncurl their ridgy backs, and at his foot appear."
4576,THE ARGUMENT.,In peace below the gentle waters run;
4577,THE ARGUMENT.,The cormorants above lie basking in the sun.
4578,THE ARGUMENT.,"On this the hero fix’d an oak in sight,"
4579,THE ARGUMENT.,The mark to guide the mariners aright.
4580,THE ARGUMENT.,"To bear with this, the seamen stretch their oars;"
4581,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then round the rock they steer, and seek the former shores."
4582,THE ARGUMENT.,"The lots decide their place. Above the rest,"

4585,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their temples crown, and shade their sweaty brows:"
4586,THE ARGUMENT.,"Besmear’d with oil, their naked shoulders shine."
4587,THE ARGUMENT.,"All take their seats, and wait the sounding sign:"
4588,THE ARGUMENT.,They gripe their oars; and ev’ry panting breast
4589,THE ARGUMENT.,"Is rais’d by turns with hope, by turns with fear depress’d."
4590,THE ARGUMENT.,The clangour of the trumpet gives the sign;
4591,THE ARGUMENT.,"At once they start, advancing in a line:"
4592,THE ARGUMENT.,With shouts the sailors rend the starry skies;
4593,THE ARGUMENT.,"Lash’d with their oars, the smoky billows rise;"
4594,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sparkles the briny main, and the vex’d ocean fries."
4595,THE ARGUMENT.,"Exact in time, with equal strokes they row:"
4596,THE ARGUMENT.,At once the brushing oars and brazen prow
4597,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dash up the sandy waves, and ope the depths below."
4598,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not fiery coursers, in a chariot race,"
4599,THE ARGUMENT.,Invade the field with half so swift a pace;
4600,THE ARGUMENT.,Not the fierce driver with more fury lends
4601,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sounding lash, and, ere the stroke descends,"
4602,THE ARGUMENT.,Low to the wheels his pliant body bends.
4603,THE ARGUMENT.,"The partial crowd their hopes and fears divide,"
4604,THE ARGUMENT.,And aid with eager shouts the favour’d side.
4605,THE ARGUMENT.,"Cries, murmurs, clamours, with a mixing sound,"
4606,THE ARGUMENT.,"From woods to woods, from hills to hills rebound."
4607,THE ARGUMENT.,
4608,THE ARGUMENT.,"Amidst the loud applauses of the shore,"
4609,THE ARGUMENT.,"Gyas outstripp’d the rest, and sprung before:"
4610,THE ARGUMENT.,"Cloanthus, better mann’d, pursued him fast,"
4611,THE ARGUMENT.,But his o’er-masted galley check’d his haste.
4612,THE ARGUMENT.,The Centaur and the Dolphin brush the brine
4613,THE ARGUMENT.,"With equal oars, advancing in a line;"
4614,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now the mighty Centaur seems to lead,"
4615,THE ARGUMENT.,And now the speedy Dolphin gets ahead;
4616,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now board to board the rival vessels row,"
4617,THE ARGUMENT.,"The billows lave the skies, and ocean groans below."
4618,THE ARGUMENT.,They reach’d the mark; proud Gyas and his train
4619,THE ARGUMENT.,"In triumph rode, the victors of the main;"
4620,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, steering round, he charg’d his pilot stand"
4621,THE ARGUMENT.,"More close to shore, and skim along the sand."
4622,THE ARGUMENT.,“Let others bear to sea!” Menoetes heard;
4623,THE ARGUMENT.,"But secret shelves too cautiously he fear’d,"
4624,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, fearing, sought the deep; and still aloof he steer’d."
4625,THE ARGUMENT.,With louder cries the captain call’d again:
4626,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Bear to the rocky shore, and shun the main.”"
4627,THE ARGUMENT.,"He spoke, and, speaking, at his stern he saw"
4628,THE ARGUMENT.,The bold Cloanthus near the shelvings draw.
4629,THE ARGUMENT.,"Betwixt the mark and him the Scylla stood,"
4630,THE ARGUMENT.,And in a closer compass plow’d the flood.
4631,THE ARGUMENT.,"He pass’d the mark; and, wheeling, got before:"
4632,THE ARGUMENT.,"Gyas blasphem’d the gods, devoutly swore,"
4633,THE ARGUMENT.,"Cried out for anger, and his hair he tore."
4634,THE ARGUMENT.,Mindless of others’ lives (so high was grown
4635,THE ARGUMENT.,"His rising rage) and careless of his own,"
4636,THE ARGUMENT.,The trembling dotard to the deck he drew;
4637,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then hoisted up, and overboard he threw:"
4638,THE ARGUMENT.,"This done, he seiz’d the helm; his fellows cheer’d,"
4639,THE ARGUMENT.,"Turn’d short upon the shelfs, and madly steer’d."
4640,THE ARGUMENT.,
4641,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hardly his head the plunging pilot rears,"
4642,THE ARGUMENT.,"Clogg’d with his clothes, and cumber’d with his years:"
4643,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now dropping wet, he climbs the cliff with pain."
4644,THE ARGUMENT.,"The crowd, that saw him fall and float again,"
4645,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shout from the distant shore; and loudly laugh’d,"
4646,THE ARGUMENT.,To see his heaving breast disgorge the briny draught.
4647,THE ARGUMENT.,"The following Centaur, and the Dolphin’s crew,"
4648,THE ARGUMENT.,Their vanish’d hopes of victory renew;
4649,THE ARGUMENT.,"While Gyas lags, they kindle in the race,"
4650,THE ARGUMENT.,To reach the mark. Sergesthus takes the place;
4651,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mnestheus pursues; and while around they wind,"
4652,THE ARGUMENT.,"Comes up, not half his galley’s length behind;"
4653,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, on the deck, amidst his mates appear’d,"
4654,THE ARGUMENT.,And thus their drooping courages he cheer’d:
4655,THE ARGUMENT.,"“My friends, and Hector’s followers heretofore,"
4656,THE ARGUMENT.,Exert your vigour; tug the lab’ring oar;
4657,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stretch to your strokes, my still unconquer’d crew,"
4658,THE ARGUMENT.,Whom from the flaming walls of Troy I drew.
4659,THE ARGUMENT.,"In this, our common int’rest, let me find"
4660,THE ARGUMENT.,"That strength of hand, that courage of the mind,"
4661,THE ARGUMENT.,"As when you stemm’d the strong Malean flood,"
4662,THE ARGUMENT.,And o’er the Syrtes’ broken billows row’d.
4663,THE ARGUMENT.,I seek not now the foremost palm to gain;
4664,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tho’ yet——But, ah! that haughty wish is vain!"
4665,THE ARGUMENT.,Let those enjoy it whom the gods ordain.
4666,THE ARGUMENT.,"But to be last, the lags of all the race!"
4667,THE ARGUMENT.,Redeem yourselves and me from that disgrace.”
4668,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, one and all, they tug amain; they row"
4669,THE ARGUMENT.,"At the full stretch, and shake the brazen prow."
4670,THE ARGUMENT.,The sea beneath ’em sinks; their lab’ring sides
4671,THE ARGUMENT.,"Are swell’d, and sweat runs gutt’ring down in tides."
4672,THE ARGUMENT.,Chance aids their daring with unhop’d success;
4673,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sergesthus, eager with his beak to press"
4674,THE ARGUMENT.,"Betwixt the rival galley and the rock,"
4675,THE ARGUMENT.,Shuts up th’ unwieldly Centaur in the lock.
4676,THE ARGUMENT.,"The vessel struck; and, with the dreadful shock,"
4677,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her oars she shiver’d, and her head she broke."
4678,THE ARGUMENT.,"The trembling rowers from their banks arise,"
4679,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, anxious for themselves, renounce the prize."
4680,THE ARGUMENT.,"With iron poles they heave her off the shores,"
4681,THE ARGUMENT.,And gather from the sea their floating oars.
4682,THE ARGUMENT.,"The crew of Mnestheus, with elated minds,"
4683,THE ARGUMENT.,"Urge their success, and call the willing winds;"
4684,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then ply their oars, and cut their liquid way"
4685,THE ARGUMENT.,In larger compass on the roomy sea.
4686,THE ARGUMENT.,"As, when the dove her rocky hold forsakes,"
4687,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rous’d in a fright, her sounding wings she shakes;"
4688,THE ARGUMENT.,"The cavern rings with clatt’ring; out she flies,"
4689,THE ARGUMENT.,"And leaves her callow care, and cleaves the skies:"
4690,THE ARGUMENT.,At first she flutters; but at length she springs
4691,THE ARGUMENT.,"To smoother flight, and shoots upon her wings:"
4692,THE ARGUMENT.,So Mnestheus in the Dolphin cuts the sea;
4693,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, flying with a force, that force assists his way."
4694,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sergesthus in the Centaur soon he pass’d,"
4695,THE ARGUMENT.,"Wedg’d in the rocky shoals, and sticking fast."
4696,THE ARGUMENT.,"In vain the victor he with cries implores,"
4697,THE ARGUMENT.,And practices to row with shatter’d oars.
4698,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Mnestheus bears with Gyas, and outflies:"
4699,THE ARGUMENT.,"The ship, without a pilot, yields the prize."
4700,THE ARGUMENT.,Unvanquish’d Scylla now alone remains;
4701,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her he pursues, and all his vigour strains."
4702,THE ARGUMENT.,Shouts from the fav’ring multitude arise;
4703,THE ARGUMENT.,Applauding Echo to the shouts replies;
4704,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shouts, wishes, and applause run rattling thro’ the skies."
4705,THE ARGUMENT.,"These clamours with disdain the Scylla heard,"
4706,THE ARGUMENT.,"Much grudg’d the praise, but more the robb’d reward:"
4707,THE ARGUMENT.,"Resolv’d to hold their own, they mend their pace,"
4708,THE ARGUMENT.,"All obstinate to die, or gain the race."
4709,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rais’d with success, the Dolphin swiftly ran;"
4710,THE ARGUMENT.,"For they can conquer, who believe they can."
4711,THE ARGUMENT.,"Both urge their oars, and fortune both supplies,"
4712,THE ARGUMENT.,And both perhaps had shar’d an equal prize;
4713,THE ARGUMENT.,"When to the seas Cloanthus holds his hands,"
4714,THE ARGUMENT.,And succour from the wat’ry pow’rs demands:
4715,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Gods of the liquid realms, on which I row!"
4716,THE ARGUMENT.,"If, giv’n by you, the laurel bind my brow,"
4717,THE ARGUMENT.,Assist to make me guilty of my vow!
4718,THE ARGUMENT.,A snow-white bull shall on your shore be slain;
4719,THE ARGUMENT.,"His offer’d entrails cast into the main,"
4720,THE ARGUMENT.,"And ruddy wine, from golden goblets thrown,"
4721,THE ARGUMENT.,Your grateful gift and my return shall own.”
4722,THE ARGUMENT.,"The choir of nymphs, and Phorcus, from below,"
4723,THE ARGUMENT.,"With virgin Panopea, heard his vow;"
4724,THE ARGUMENT.,"And old Portunus, with his breadth of hand,"
4725,THE ARGUMENT.,"Push’d on, and sped the galley to the land."
4726,THE ARGUMENT.,"Swift as a shaft, or winged wind, she flies,"
4727,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, darting to the port, obtains the prize."
4728,THE ARGUMENT.,
4729,THE ARGUMENT.,"The herald summons all, and then proclaims"
4730,THE ARGUMENT.,Cloanthus conqu’ror of the naval games.
4731,THE ARGUMENT.,"The prince with laurel crowns the victor’s head,"
4732,THE ARGUMENT.,"And three fat steers are to his vessel led,"
4733,THE ARGUMENT.,"The ship’s reward; with gen’rous wine beside,"
4734,THE ARGUMENT.,"And sums of silver, which the crew divide."
4735,THE ARGUMENT.,The leaders are distinguish’d from the rest;
4736,THE ARGUMENT.,"The victor honour’d with a nobler vest,"
4737,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where gold and purple strive in equal rows,"
4738,THE ARGUMENT.,And needlework its happy cost bestows.
4739,THE ARGUMENT.,"There Ganymede is wrought with living art,"
4740,THE ARGUMENT.,Chasing thro’ Ida’s groves the trembling hart:
4741,THE ARGUMENT.,"Breathless he seems, yet eager to pursue;"
4742,THE ARGUMENT.,"When from aloft descends, in open view,"
4743,THE ARGUMENT.,"The bird of Jove, and, sousing on his prey,"
4744,THE ARGUMENT.,With crooked talons bears the boy away.
4745,THE ARGUMENT.,"In vain, with lifted hands and gazing eyes,"
4746,THE ARGUMENT.,"His guards behold him soaring thro’ the skies,"
4747,THE ARGUMENT.,And dogs pursue his flight with imitated cries.
4748,THE ARGUMENT.,
4749,THE ARGUMENT.,Mnestheus the second victor was declar’d;
4750,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, summon’d there, the second prize he shar’d."
4751,THE ARGUMENT.,"A coat of mail, brave Demoleus bore,"
4752,THE ARGUMENT.,"More brave Aeneas from his shoulders tore,"
4753,THE ARGUMENT.,In single combat on the Trojan shore:
4754,THE ARGUMENT.,This was ordain’d for Mnestheus to possess;
4755,THE ARGUMENT.,"In war for his defence, for ornament in peace."
4756,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rich was the gift, and glorious to behold,"
4757,THE ARGUMENT.,"But yet so pond’rous with its plates of gold,"
4758,THE ARGUMENT.,That scarce two servants could the weight sustain;
4759,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet, loaded thus, Demoleus o’er the plain"
4760,THE ARGUMENT.,Pursued and lightly seiz’d the Trojan train.
4761,THE ARGUMENT.,"The third, succeeding to the last reward,"
4762,THE ARGUMENT.,"Two goodly bowls of massy silver shar’d,"
4763,THE ARGUMENT.,"With figures prominent, and richly wrought,"
4764,THE ARGUMENT.,And two brass caldrons from Dodona brought.
4765,THE ARGUMENT.,
4766,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus all, rewarded by the hero’s hands,"
4767,THE ARGUMENT.,Their conqu’ring temples bound with purple bands;
4768,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now Sergesthus, clearing from the rock,"
4769,THE ARGUMENT.,Brought back his galley shatter’d with the shock.
4770,THE ARGUMENT.,"Forlorn she look’d, without an aiding oar,"
4771,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, houted by the vulgar, made to shore."
4772,THE ARGUMENT.,"As when a snake, surpris’d upon the road,"
4773,THE ARGUMENT.,Is crush’d athwart her body by the load
4774,THE ARGUMENT.,Of heavy wheels; or with a mortal wound
4775,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her belly bruis’d, and trodden to the ground:"
4776,THE ARGUMENT.,"In vain, with loosen’d curls, she crawls along;"
4777,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet, fierce above, she brandishes her tongue;"
4778,THE ARGUMENT.,"Glares with her eyes, and bristles with her scales;"
4779,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, groveling in the dust, her parts unsound she trails:"
4780,THE ARGUMENT.,"So slowly to the port the Centaur tends,"
4781,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, what she wants in oars, with sails amends."
4782,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet, for his galley sav’d, the grateful prince"
4783,THE ARGUMENT.,Is pleas’d th’ unhappy chief to recompense.
4784,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pholoe, the Cretan slave, rewards his care,"
4785,THE ARGUMENT.,"Beauteous herself, with lovely twins as fair."
4786,THE ARGUMENT.,
4787,THE ARGUMENT.,From thence his way the Trojan hero bent
4788,THE ARGUMENT.,"Into the neighb’ring plain, with mountains pent,"
4789,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose sides were shaded with surrounding wood.
4790,THE ARGUMENT.,Full in the midst of this fair valley stood
4791,THE ARGUMENT.,"A native theatre, which, rising slow"
4792,THE ARGUMENT.,"By just degrees, o’erlook’d the ground below."
4793,THE ARGUMENT.,High on a sylvan throne the leader sate;
4794,THE ARGUMENT.,A num’rous train attend in solemn state.
4795,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here those that in the rapid course delight,"
4796,THE ARGUMENT.,Desire of honour and the prize invite.
4797,THE ARGUMENT.,The rival runners without order stand;
4798,THE ARGUMENT.,The Trojans mix’d with the Sicilian band.
4799,THE ARGUMENT.,"First Nisus, with Euryalus, appears;"
4800,THE ARGUMENT.,"Euryalus a boy of blooming years,"
4801,THE ARGUMENT.,With sprightly grace and equal beauty crown’d;
4802,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nisus, for friendship to the youth renown’d."
4803,THE ARGUMENT.,"Diores next, of Priam’s royal race,"
4804,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Salius joined with Patron, took their place;"
4805,THE ARGUMENT.,"But Patron in Arcadia had his birth,"
4806,THE ARGUMENT.,And Salius his from Arcananian earth;
4807,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then two Sicilian youths, the names of these,"
4808,THE ARGUMENT.,"Swift Helymus, and lovely Panopes:"
4809,THE ARGUMENT.,"Both jolly huntsmen, both in forest bred,"
4810,THE ARGUMENT.,And owning old Acestes for their head;
4811,THE ARGUMENT.,"With sev’ral others of ignobler name,"
4812,THE ARGUMENT.,Whom time has not deliver’d o’er to fame.
4813,THE ARGUMENT.,
4814,THE ARGUMENT.,"To these the hero thus his thoughts explain’d,"
4815,THE ARGUMENT.,In words which gen’ral approbation gain’d:
4816,THE ARGUMENT.,"“One common largess is for all design’d,"
4817,THE ARGUMENT.,"The vanquish’d and the victor shall be join’d,"
4818,THE ARGUMENT.,"Two darts of polish’d steel and Gnosian wood,"
4819,THE ARGUMENT.,A silver-studded ax alike bestow’d.
4820,THE ARGUMENT.,The foremost three have olive wreaths decreed:
4821,THE ARGUMENT.,"The first of these obtains a stately steed,"
4822,THE ARGUMENT.,"Adorn’d with trappings; and the next in fame,"
4823,THE ARGUMENT.,"The quiver of an Amazonian dame,"
4824,THE ARGUMENT.,With feather’d Thracian arrows well supplied:
4825,THE ARGUMENT.,"A golden belt shall gird his manly side,"
4826,THE ARGUMENT.,Which with a sparkling diamond shall be tied.
4827,THE ARGUMENT.,The third this Grecian helmet shall content.”
4828,THE ARGUMENT.,He said. To their appointed base they went;
4829,THE ARGUMENT.,"With beating hearts th’ expected sign receive,"
4830,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, starting all at once, the barrier leave."
4831,THE ARGUMENT.,"Spread out, as on the winged winds, they flew,"
4832,THE ARGUMENT.,And seiz’d the distant goal with greedy view.
4833,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shot from the crowd, swift Nisus all o’erpass’d;"
4834,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor storms, nor thunder, equal half his haste."
4835,THE ARGUMENT.,"The next, but tho’ the next, yet far disjoin’d,"
4836,THE ARGUMENT.,"Came Salius, and Euryalus behind;"
4837,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Helymus, whom young Diores plied,"
4838,THE ARGUMENT.,"Step after step, and almost side by side,"
4839,THE ARGUMENT.,"His shoulders pressing; and, in longer space,"
4840,THE ARGUMENT.,"Had won, or left at least a dubious race."
4841,THE ARGUMENT.,
4842,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, spent, the goal they almost reach at last,"
4843,THE ARGUMENT.,"When eager Nisus, hapless in his haste,"
4844,THE ARGUMENT.,"Slipp’d first, and, slipping, fell upon the plain,"
4845,THE ARGUMENT.,Soak’d with the blood of oxen newly slain.
4846,THE ARGUMENT.,The careless victor had not mark’d his way;
4847,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, treading where the treach’rous puddle lay,"
4848,THE ARGUMENT.,His heels flew up; and on the grassy floor
4849,THE ARGUMENT.,"He fell, besmear’d with filth and holy gore."
4850,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not mindless then, Euryalus, of thee,"
4851,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor of the sacred bonds of amity,"
4852,THE ARGUMENT.,"He strove th’ immediate rival’s hope to cross,"
4853,THE ARGUMENT.,And caught the foot of Salius as he rose.
4854,THE ARGUMENT.,So Salius lay extended on the plain;
4855,THE ARGUMENT.,"Euryalus springs out, the prize to gain,"
4856,THE ARGUMENT.,And leaves the crowd: applauding peals attend
4857,THE ARGUMENT.,"The victor to the goal, who vanquish’d by his friend."
4858,THE ARGUMENT.,"Next Helymus; and then Diores came,"
4859,THE ARGUMENT.,By two misfortunes made the third in fame.
4860,THE ARGUMENT.,
4861,THE ARGUMENT.,"But Salius enters, and, exclaiming loud"
4862,THE ARGUMENT.,"For justice, deafens and disturbs the crowd;"
4863,THE ARGUMENT.,Urges his cause may in the court be heard;
4864,THE ARGUMENT.,And pleads the prize is wrongfully conferr’d.
4865,THE ARGUMENT.,But favour for Euryalus appears;
4866,THE ARGUMENT.,"His blooming beauty, with his tender tears,"
4867,THE ARGUMENT.,Had brib’d the judges for the promis’d prize.
4868,THE ARGUMENT.,"Besides, Diores fills the court with cries,"
4869,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who vainly reaches at the last reward,"
4870,THE ARGUMENT.,If the first palm on Salius be conferr’d.
4871,THE ARGUMENT.,Then thus the prince: “Let no disputes arise:
4872,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where fortune plac’d it, I award the prize."
4873,THE ARGUMENT.,"But fortune’s errors give me leave to mend,"
4874,THE ARGUMENT.,At least to pity my deserving friend.”
4875,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said, and, from among the spoils, he draws"
4876,THE ARGUMENT.,(Pond’rous with shaggy mane and golden paws)
4877,THE ARGUMENT.,A lion’s hide: to Salius this he gives.
4878,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nisus with envy sees the gift, and grieves."
4879,THE ARGUMENT.,“If such rewards to vanquish’d men are due.”
4880,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said, “and falling is to rise by you,"
4881,THE ARGUMENT.,"What prize may Nisus from your bounty claim,"
4882,THE ARGUMENT.,Who merited the first rewards and fame?
4883,THE ARGUMENT.,"In falling, both an equal fortune tried;"
4884,THE ARGUMENT.,Would fortune for my fall so well provide!”
4885,THE ARGUMENT.,"With this he pointed to his face, and show’d"
4886,THE ARGUMENT.,His hand and all his habit smear’d with blood.
4887,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ indulgent father of the people smil’d,"
4888,THE ARGUMENT.,"And caus’d to be produc’d an ample shield,"
4889,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of wondrous art, by Didymaon wrought,"
4890,THE ARGUMENT.,Long since from Neptune’s bars in triumph brought.
4891,THE ARGUMENT.,"This giv’n to Nisus, he divides the rest,"
4892,THE ARGUMENT.,And equal justice in his gifts express’d.
4893,THE ARGUMENT.,
4894,THE ARGUMENT.,"The race thus ended, and rewards bestow’d,"
4895,THE ARGUMENT.,Once more the prince bespeaks th’ attentive crowd:
4896,THE ARGUMENT.,"“If there be here, whose dauntless courage dare"
4897,THE ARGUMENT.,"In gauntlet fight, with limbs and body bare,"
4898,THE ARGUMENT.,"His opposite sustain in open view,"
4899,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stand forth the champion, and the games renew."
4900,THE ARGUMENT.,"Two prizes I propose, and thus divide:"
4901,THE ARGUMENT.,"A bull with gilded horns, and fillets tied,"
4902,THE ARGUMENT.,Shall be the portion of the conqu’ring chief;
4903,THE ARGUMENT.,A sword and helm shall cheer the loser’s grief.”
4904,THE ARGUMENT.,
4905,THE ARGUMENT.,Then haughty Dares in the lists appears;
4906,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stalking he strides, his head erected bears:"
4907,THE ARGUMENT.,"His nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield,"
4908,THE ARGUMENT.,And loud applauses echo thro’ the field.
4909,THE ARGUMENT.,Dares alone in combat us’d to stand
4910,THE ARGUMENT.,"The match of mighty Paris, hand to hand;"
4911,THE ARGUMENT.,"The same, at Hector’s fun’rals, undertook"
4912,THE ARGUMENT.,"Gigantic Butes, of th’ Amycian stock,"
4913,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, by the stroke of his resistless hand,"
4914,THE ARGUMENT.,Stretch’d the vast bulk upon the yellow sand.
4915,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such Dares was; and such he strode along,"
4916,THE ARGUMENT.,And drew the wonder of the gazing throng.
4917,THE ARGUMENT.,"His brawny back and ample breast he shows,"
4918,THE ARGUMENT.,"His lifted arms around his head he throws,"
4919,THE ARGUMENT.,And deals in whistling air his empty blows.
4920,THE ARGUMENT.,"His match is sought; but, thro’ the trembling band,"
4921,THE ARGUMENT.,Not one dares answer to the proud demand.
4922,THE ARGUMENT.,"Presuming of his force, with sparkling eyes"
4923,THE ARGUMENT.,Already he devours the promis’d prize.
4924,THE ARGUMENT.,"He claims the bull with awless insolence,"
4925,THE ARGUMENT.,"And having seiz’d his horns, accosts the prince:"
4926,THE ARGUMENT.,"“If none my matchless valour dares oppose,"
4927,THE ARGUMENT.,How long shall Dares wait his dastard foes?
4928,THE ARGUMENT.,"Permit me, chief, permit without delay,"
4929,THE ARGUMENT.,To lead this uncontended gift away.”
4930,THE ARGUMENT.,"The crowd assents, and with redoubled cries"
4931,THE ARGUMENT.,For the proud challenger demands the prize.
4932,THE ARGUMENT.,
4933,THE ARGUMENT.,"Acestes, fir’d with just disdain, to see"
4934,THE ARGUMENT.,"The palm usurp’d without a victory,"
4935,THE ARGUMENT.,"Reproach’d Entellus thus, who sate beside,"
4936,THE ARGUMENT.,"And heard and saw, unmov’d, the Trojan’s pride:"
4937,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Once, but in vain, a champion of renown,"
4938,THE ARGUMENT.,"So tamely can you bear the ravish’d crown,"
4939,THE ARGUMENT.,"A prize in triumph borne before your sight,"
4940,THE ARGUMENT.,"And shun, for fear, the danger of the fight?"
4941,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where is our Eryx now, the boasted name,"
4942,THE ARGUMENT.,The god who taught your thund’ring arm the game?
4943,THE ARGUMENT.,Where now your baffled honour? Where the spoil
4944,THE ARGUMENT.,"That fill’d your house, and fame that fill’d our isle?”"
4945,THE ARGUMENT.,"Entellus, thus: “My soul is still the same,"
4946,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unmov’d with fear, and mov’d with martial fame;"
4947,THE ARGUMENT.,"But my chill blood is curdled in my veins,"
4948,THE ARGUMENT.,And scarce the shadow of a man remains.
4949,THE ARGUMENT.,"O could I turn to that fair prime again,"
4950,THE ARGUMENT.,"That prime of which this boaster is so vain,"
4951,THE ARGUMENT.,"The brave, who this decrepid age defies,"
4952,THE ARGUMENT.,"Should feel my force, without the promis’d prize.”"
4953,THE ARGUMENT.,
4954,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said; and, rising at the word, he threw"
4955,THE ARGUMENT.,Two pond’rous gauntlets down in open view;
4956,THE ARGUMENT.,"Gauntlets which Eryx wont in fight to wield,"
4957,THE ARGUMENT.,And sheathe his hands with in the listed field.
4958,THE ARGUMENT.,"With fear and wonder seiz’d, the crowd beholds"
4959,THE ARGUMENT.,"The gloves of death, with sev’n distinguish’d folds"
4960,THE ARGUMENT.,Of tough bull hides; the space within is spread
4961,THE ARGUMENT.,"With iron, or with loads of heavy lead:"
4962,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dares himself was daunted at the sight,"
4963,THE ARGUMENT.,"Renounc’d his challenge, and refus’d to fight."
4964,THE ARGUMENT.,"Astonish’d at their weight, the hero stands,"
4965,THE ARGUMENT.,And pois’d the pond’rous engines in his hands.
4966,THE ARGUMENT.,"“What had your wonder,” said Entellus, “been,"
4967,THE ARGUMENT.,"Had you the gauntlets of Alcides seen,"
4968,THE ARGUMENT.,Or view’d the stern debate on this unhappy green!
4969,THE ARGUMENT.,"These which I bear your brother Eryx bore,"
4970,THE ARGUMENT.,Still mark’d with batter’d brains and mingled gore.
4971,THE ARGUMENT.,With these he long sustain’d th’ Herculean arm;
4972,THE ARGUMENT.,"And these I wielded while my blood was warm,"
4973,THE ARGUMENT.,"This languish’d frame while better spirits fed,"
4974,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ere age unstrung my nerves, or time o’ersnow’d my head."
4975,THE ARGUMENT.,"But if the challenger these arms refuse,"
4976,THE ARGUMENT.,"And cannot wield their weight, or dare not use;"
4977,THE ARGUMENT.,If great Aeneas and Acestes join
4978,THE ARGUMENT.,"In his request, these gauntlets I resign;"
4979,THE ARGUMENT.,"Let us with equal arms perform the fight,"
4980,THE ARGUMENT.,"And let him leave to fear, since I resign my right.”"
4981,THE ARGUMENT.,
4982,THE ARGUMENT.,"This said, Entellus for the strife prepares;"
4983,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stripp’d of his quilted coat, his body bares;"
4984,THE ARGUMENT.,"Compos’d of mighty bones and brawn he stands,"
4985,THE ARGUMENT.,A goodly tow’ring object on the sands.
4986,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then just Aeneas equal arms supplied,"
4987,THE ARGUMENT.,Which round their shoulders to their wrists they tied.
4988,THE ARGUMENT.,"Both on the tiptoe stand, at full extent,"
4989,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their arms aloft, their bodies inly bent;"
4990,THE ARGUMENT.,Their heads from aiming blows they bear afar;
4991,THE ARGUMENT.,With clashing gauntlets then provoke the war.
4992,THE ARGUMENT.,One on his youth and pliant limbs relies;
4993,THE ARGUMENT.,One on his sinews and his giant size.
4994,THE ARGUMENT.,"The last is stiff with age, his motion slow;"
4995,THE ARGUMENT.,"He heaves for breath, he staggers to and fro,"
4996,THE ARGUMENT.,And clouds of issuing smoke his nostrils loudly blow.
4997,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet equal in success, they ward, they strike;"
4998,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their ways are diff’rent, but their art alike."
4999,THE ARGUMENT.,"Before, behind, the blows are dealt; around"
5000,THE ARGUMENT.,Their hollow sides the rattling thumps resound.
5001,THE ARGUMENT.,"A storm of strokes, well meant, with fury flies,"
5002,THE ARGUMENT.,"And errs about their temples, ears, and eyes."
5003,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor always errs; for oft the gauntlet draws
5004,THE ARGUMENT.,A sweeping stroke along the crackling jaws.
5005,THE ARGUMENT.,"Heavy with age, Entellus stands his ground,"
5006,THE ARGUMENT.,But with his warping body wards the wound.
5007,THE ARGUMENT.,His hand and watchful eye keep even pace;
5008,THE ARGUMENT.,"While Dares traverses and shifts his place,"
5009,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, like a captain who beleaguers round"
5010,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some strong-built castle on a rising ground,"
5011,THE ARGUMENT.,Views all th’ approaches with observing eyes:
5012,THE ARGUMENT.,"This and that other part in vain he tries,"
5013,THE ARGUMENT.,And more on industry than force relies.
5014,THE ARGUMENT.,"With hands on high, Entellus threats the foe;"
5015,THE ARGUMENT.,"But Dares watch’d the motion from below,"
5016,THE ARGUMENT.,"And slipp’d aside, and shunn’d the long descending blow."
5017,THE ARGUMENT.,"Entellus wastes his forces on the wind,"
5018,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, thus deluded of the stroke design’d,"
5019,THE ARGUMENT.,Headlong and heavy fell; his ample breast
5020,THE ARGUMENT.,And weighty limbs his ancient mother press’d.
5021,THE ARGUMENT.,"So falls a hollow pine, that long had stood"
5022,THE ARGUMENT.,"On Ida’s height, or Erymanthus’ wood,"
5023,THE ARGUMENT.,"Torn from the roots. The diff’ring nations rise,"
5024,THE ARGUMENT.,"And shouts and mingled murmurs rend the skies,"
5025,THE ARGUMENT.,"Acestus runs with eager haste, to raise"
5026,THE ARGUMENT.,The fall’n companion of his youthful days.
5027,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dauntless he rose, and to the fight return’d;"
5028,THE ARGUMENT.,"With shame his glowing cheeks, his eyes with fury burn’d."
5029,THE ARGUMENT.,"Disdain and conscious virtue fir’d his breast,"
5030,THE ARGUMENT.,And with redoubled force his foe he press’d.
5031,THE ARGUMENT.,"He lays on load with either hand, amain,"
5032,THE ARGUMENT.,And headlong drives the Trojan o’er the plain;
5033,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor stops, nor stays; nor rest nor breath allows;"
5034,THE ARGUMENT.,"But storms of strokes descend about his brows,"
5035,THE ARGUMENT.,"A rattling tempest, and a hail of blows."
5036,THE ARGUMENT.,"But now the prince, who saw the wild increase"
5037,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of wounds, commands the combatants to cease,"
5038,THE ARGUMENT.,"And bounds Entellus’ wrath, and bids the peace."
5039,THE ARGUMENT.,"First to the Trojan, spent with toil, he came,"
5040,THE ARGUMENT.,And sooth’d his sorrow for the suffer’d shame.
5041,THE ARGUMENT.,"“What fury seiz’d my friend? The gods,” said he,"
5042,THE ARGUMENT.,"“To him propitious, and averse to thee,"
5043,THE ARGUMENT.,Have giv’n his arm superior force to thine.
5044,THE ARGUMENT.,’Tis madness to contend with strength divine.”
5045,THE ARGUMENT.,"The gauntlet fight thus ended, from the shore"
5046,THE ARGUMENT.,His faithful friends unhappy Dares bore:
5047,THE ARGUMENT.,"His mouth and nostrils pour’d a purple flood,"
5048,THE ARGUMENT.,And pounded teeth came rushing with his blood.
5049,THE ARGUMENT.,"Faintly he stagger’d thro’ the hissing throng,"
5050,THE ARGUMENT.,"And hung his head, and trail’d his legs along."
5051,THE ARGUMENT.,The sword and casque are carried by his train;
5052,THE ARGUMENT.,But with his foe the palm and ox remain.
5053,THE ARGUMENT.,
5054,THE ARGUMENT.,"The champion, then, before Aeneas came,"
5055,THE ARGUMENT.,"Proud of his prize, but prouder of his fame:"
5056,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O goddess-born, and you, Dardanian host,"
5057,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mark with attention, and forgive my boast;"
5058,THE ARGUMENT.,"Learn what I was, by what remains; and know"
5059,THE ARGUMENT.,From what impending fate you sav’d my foe.”
5060,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sternly he spoke, and then confronts the bull;"
5061,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, on his ample forehead aiming full,"
5062,THE ARGUMENT.,"The deadly stroke, descending, pierc’d the skull."
5063,THE ARGUMENT.,"Down drops the beast, nor needs a second wound,"
5064,THE ARGUMENT.,"But sprawls in pangs of death, and spurns the ground."
5065,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, thus: “In Dares’ stead I offer this."
5066,THE ARGUMENT.,"Eryx, accept a nobler sacrifice;"
5067,THE ARGUMENT.,Take the last gift my wither’d arms can yield:
5068,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy gauntlets I resign, and here renounce the field.”"
5069,THE ARGUMENT.,
5070,THE ARGUMENT.,"This done, Aeneas orders, for the close,"
5071,THE ARGUMENT.,The strife of archers with contending bows.
5072,THE ARGUMENT.,The mast Sergesthus’ shatter’d galley bore
5073,THE ARGUMENT.,With his own hands he raises on the shore.
5074,THE ARGUMENT.,"A flutt’ring dove upon the top they tie,"
5075,THE ARGUMENT.,The living mark at which their arrows fly.
5076,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rival archers in a line advance,"
5077,THE ARGUMENT.,Their turn of shooting to receive from chance.
5078,THE ARGUMENT.,A helmet holds their names; the lots are drawn:
5079,THE ARGUMENT.,On the first scroll was read Hippocoon.
5080,THE ARGUMENT.,The people shout. Upon the next was found
5081,THE ARGUMENT.,"Young Mnestheus, late with naval honours crown’d."
5082,THE ARGUMENT.,"The third contain’d Eurytion’s noble name,"
5083,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy brother, Pandarus, and next in fame,"
5084,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whom Pallas urg’d the treaty to confound,"
5085,THE ARGUMENT.,And send among the Greeks a feather’d wound.
5086,THE ARGUMENT.,"Acestes in the bottom last remain’d,"
5087,THE ARGUMENT.,Whom not his age from youthful sports restrain’d.
5088,THE ARGUMENT.,"Soon all with vigour bend their trusty bows,"
5089,THE ARGUMENT.,And from the quiver each his arrow chose.
5090,THE ARGUMENT.,Hippocoon’s was the first: with forceful sway
5091,THE ARGUMENT.,"It flew, and, whizzing, cut the liquid way."
5092,THE ARGUMENT.,Fix’d in the mast the feather’d weapon stands:
5093,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fearful pigeon flutters in her bands,"
5094,THE ARGUMENT.,"And the tree trembled, and the shouting cries"
5095,THE ARGUMENT.,Of the pleas’d people rend the vaulted skies.
5096,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Mnestheus to the head his arrow drove,"
5097,THE ARGUMENT.,"With lifted eyes, and took his aim above,"
5098,THE ARGUMENT.,"But made a glancing shot, and missed the dove;"
5099,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet miss’d so narrow, that he cut the cord"
5100,THE ARGUMENT.,Which fasten’d by the foot the flitting bird.
5101,THE ARGUMENT.,"The captive thus releas’d, away she flies,"
5102,THE ARGUMENT.,And beats with clapping wings the yielding skies.
5103,THE ARGUMENT.,"His bow already bent, Eurytion stood;"
5104,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, having first invok’d his brother god,"
5105,THE ARGUMENT.,His winged shaft with eager haste he sped.
5106,THE ARGUMENT.,The fatal message reach’d her as she fled:
5107,THE ARGUMENT.,"She leaves her life aloft; she strikes the ground,"
5108,THE ARGUMENT.,And renders back the weapon in the wound.
5109,THE ARGUMENT.,"Acestes, grudging at his lot, remains,"
5110,THE ARGUMENT.,Without a prize to gratify his pains.
5111,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet, shooting upward, sends his shaft, to show"
5112,THE ARGUMENT.,"An archer’s art, and boast his twanging bow."
5113,THE ARGUMENT.,"The feather’d arrow gave a dire portent,"
5114,THE ARGUMENT.,And latter augurs judge from this event.
5115,THE ARGUMENT.,"Chaf’d by the speed, it fir’d; and, as it flew,"
5116,THE ARGUMENT.,A trail of following flames ascending drew:
5117,THE ARGUMENT.,"Kindling they mount, and mark the shiny way;"
5118,THE ARGUMENT.,"Across the skies as falling meteors play,"
5119,THE ARGUMENT.,"And vanish into wind, or in a blaze decay."
5120,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojans and Sicilians wildly stare,"
5121,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, trembling, turn their wonder into pray’r."
5122,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Dardan prince put on a smiling face,"
5123,THE ARGUMENT.,And strain’d Acestes with a close embrace;
5124,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, hon’ring him with gifts above the rest,"
5125,THE ARGUMENT.,"Turn’d the bad omen, nor his fears confess’d."
5126,THE ARGUMENT.,"“The gods,” said he, “this miracle have wrought,"
5127,THE ARGUMENT.,And order’d you the prize without the lot.
5128,THE ARGUMENT.,"Accept this goblet, rough with figur’d gold,"
5129,THE ARGUMENT.,Which Thracian Cisseus gave my sire of old:
5130,THE ARGUMENT.,"This pledge of ancient amity receive,"
5131,THE ARGUMENT.,Which to my second sire I justly give.”
5132,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said, and, with the trumpets’ cheerful sound,"
5133,THE ARGUMENT.,"Proclaim’d him victor, and with laurel-crown’d."
5134,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor good Eurytion envied him the prize,"
5135,THE ARGUMENT.,Tho’ he transfix’d the pigeon in the skies.
5136,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who cut the line, with second gifts was grac’d;"
5137,THE ARGUMENT.,The third was his whose arrow pierc’d the mast.
5138,THE ARGUMENT.,
5139,THE ARGUMENT.,"The chief, before the games were wholly done,"
5140,THE ARGUMENT.,"Call’d Periphantes, tutor to his son,"
5141,THE ARGUMENT.,And whisper’d thus: “With speed Ascanius find;
5142,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, if his childish troop be ready join’d,"
5143,THE ARGUMENT.,"On horseback let him grace his grandsire’s day,"
5144,THE ARGUMENT.,And lead his equals arm’d in just array.”
5145,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said; and, calling out, the cirque he clears."
5146,THE ARGUMENT.,"The crowd withdrawn, an open plain appears."
5147,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now the noble youths, of form divine,"
5148,THE ARGUMENT.,"Advance before their fathers, in a line;"
5149,THE ARGUMENT.,The riders grace the steeds; the steeds with glory shine.
5150,THE ARGUMENT.,
5151,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus marching on in military pride,"
5152,THE ARGUMENT.,Shouts of applause resound from side to side.
5153,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their casques adorn’d with laurel wreaths they wear,"
5154,THE ARGUMENT.,Each brandishing aloft a cornel spear.
5155,THE ARGUMENT.,Some at their backs their gilded quivers bore;
5156,THE ARGUMENT.,Their chains of burnish’d gold hung down before.
5157,THE ARGUMENT.,Three graceful troops they form’d upon the green;
5158,THE ARGUMENT.,Three graceful leaders at their head were seen;
5159,THE ARGUMENT.,"Twelve follow’d ev’ry chief, and left a space between."
5160,THE ARGUMENT.,"The first young Priam led; a lovely boy,"
5161,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose grandsire was th’ unhappy king of Troy;
5162,THE ARGUMENT.,"His race in after times was known to fame,"
5163,THE ARGUMENT.,New honours adding to the Latian name;
5164,THE ARGUMENT.,And well the royal boy his Thracian steed became.
5165,THE ARGUMENT.,"White were the fetlocks of his feet before,"
5166,THE ARGUMENT.,And on his front a snowy star he bore.
5167,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then beauteous Atys, with Iulus bred,"
5168,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of equal age, the second squadron led."
5169,THE ARGUMENT.,"The last in order, but the first in place,"
5170,THE ARGUMENT.,"First in the lovely features of his face,"
5171,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rode fair Ascanius on a fiery steed,"
5172,THE ARGUMENT.,"Queen Dido’s gift, and of the Tyrian breed."
5173,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sure coursers for the rest the king ordains,"
5174,THE ARGUMENT.,"With golden bits adorn’d, and purple reins."
5175,THE ARGUMENT.,
5176,THE ARGUMENT.,"The pleas’d spectators peals of shouts renew,"
5177,THE ARGUMENT.,And all the parents in the children view;
5178,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their make, their motions, and their sprightly grace,"
5179,THE ARGUMENT.,And hopes and fears alternate in their face.
5180,THE ARGUMENT.,
5181,THE ARGUMENT.,Th’ unfledg’d commanders and their martial train
5182,THE ARGUMENT.,First make the circuit of the sandy plain
5183,THE ARGUMENT.,"Around their sires, and, at th’ appointed sign,"
5184,THE ARGUMENT.,"Drawn up in beauteous order, form a line."
5185,THE ARGUMENT.,"The second signal sounds, the troop divides"
5186,THE ARGUMENT.,"In three distinguish’d parts, with three distinguish’d guides"
5187,THE ARGUMENT.,"Again they close, and once again disjoin;"
5188,THE ARGUMENT.,"In troop to troop oppos’d, and line to line."
5189,THE ARGUMENT.,They meet; they wheel; they throw their darts afar
5190,THE ARGUMENT.,With harmless rage and well-dissembled war.
5191,THE ARGUMENT.,Then in a round the mingled bodies run:
5192,THE ARGUMENT.,"Flying they follow, and pursuing shun;"
5193,THE ARGUMENT.,"Broken, they break; and, rallying, they renew"
5194,THE ARGUMENT.,In other forms the military shew.
5195,THE ARGUMENT.,"At last, in order, undiscern’d they join,"
5196,THE ARGUMENT.,And march together in a friendly line.
5197,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, as the Cretan labyrinth of old,"
5198,THE ARGUMENT.,"With wand’ring ways and many a winding fold,"
5199,THE ARGUMENT.,"Involv’d the weary feet, without redress,"
5200,THE ARGUMENT.,"In a round error, which denied recess;"
5201,THE ARGUMENT.,"So fought the Trojan boys in warlike play,"
5202,THE ARGUMENT.,"Turn’d and return’d, and still a diff’rent way."
5203,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus dolphins in the deep each other chase
5204,THE ARGUMENT.,"In circles, when they swim around the wat’ry race."
5205,THE ARGUMENT.,"This game, these carousels, Ascanius taught;"
5206,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, building Alba, to the Latins brought;"
5207,THE ARGUMENT.,Shew’d what he learn’d: the Latin sires impart
5208,THE ARGUMENT.,To their succeeding sons the graceful art;
5209,THE ARGUMENT.,"From these imperial Rome receiv’d the game,"
5210,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which Troy, the youths the Trojan troop, they name."
5211,THE ARGUMENT.,
5212,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus far the sacred sports they celebrate:
5213,THE ARGUMENT.,But Fortune soon resum’d her ancient hate;
5214,THE ARGUMENT.,"For, while they pay the dead his annual dues,"
5215,THE ARGUMENT.,Those envied rites Saturnian Juno views;
5216,THE ARGUMENT.,"And sends the goddess of the various bow,"
5217,THE ARGUMENT.,To try new methods of revenge below;
5218,THE ARGUMENT.,"Supplies the winds to wing her airy way,"
5219,THE ARGUMENT.,Where in the port secure the navy lay.
5220,THE ARGUMENT.,"Swiftly fair Iris down her arch descends,"
5221,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, undiscern’d, her fatal voyage ends."
5222,THE ARGUMENT.,"She saw the gath’ring crowd; and, gliding thence,"
5223,THE ARGUMENT.,"The desert shore, and fleet without defence."
5224,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojan matrons, on the sands alone,"
5225,THE ARGUMENT.,With sighs and tears Anchises’ death bemoan;
5226,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, turning to the sea their weeping eyes,"
5227,THE ARGUMENT.,Their pity to themselves renews their cries.
5228,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Alas!” said one, “what oceans yet remain"
5229,THE ARGUMENT.,For us to sail! what labours to sustain!”
5230,THE ARGUMENT.,"All take the word, and, with a gen’ral groan,"
5231,THE ARGUMENT.,"Implore the gods for peace, and places of their own."
5232,THE ARGUMENT.,
5233,THE ARGUMENT.,"The goddess, great in mischief, views their pains,"
5234,THE ARGUMENT.,And in a woman’s form her heav’nly limbs restrains.
5235,THE ARGUMENT.,"In face and shape old Beroe she became,"
5236,THE ARGUMENT.,"Doryclus’ wife, a venerable dame,"
5237,THE ARGUMENT.,"Once blest with riches, and a mother’s name."
5238,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus chang’d, amidst the crying crowd she ran,"
5239,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mix’d with the matrons, and these words began:"
5240,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O wretched we, whom not the Grecian pow’r,"
5241,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor flames, destroy’d, in Troy’s unhappy hour!"
5242,THE ARGUMENT.,"O wretched we, reserv’d by cruel fate,"
5243,THE ARGUMENT.,Beyond the ruins of the sinking state!
5244,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now sev’n revolving years are wholly run,"
5245,THE ARGUMENT.,Since this improsp’rous voyage we begun;
5246,THE ARGUMENT.,"Since, toss’d from shores to shores, from lands to lands,"
5247,THE ARGUMENT.,"Inhospitable rocks and barren sands,"
5248,THE ARGUMENT.,"Wand’ring in exile thro’ the stormy sea,"
5249,THE ARGUMENT.,We search in vain for flying Italy.
5250,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now cast by fortune on this kindred land,"
5251,THE ARGUMENT.,"What should our rest and rising walls withstand,"
5252,THE ARGUMENT.,Or hinder here to fix our banish’d band?
5253,THE ARGUMENT.,"O country lost, and gods redeem’d in vain,"
5254,THE ARGUMENT.,If still in endless exile we remain!
5255,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shall we no more the Trojan walls renew,"
5256,THE ARGUMENT.,Or streams of some dissembled Simois view!
5257,THE ARGUMENT.,"Haste, join with me, th’ unhappy fleet consume!"
5258,THE ARGUMENT.,Cassandra bids; and I declare her doom.
5259,THE ARGUMENT.,In sleep I saw her; she supplied my hands
5260,THE ARGUMENT.,(For this I more than dreamt) with flaming brands:
5261,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘With these,’ said she, ‘these wand’ring ships destroy:"
5262,THE ARGUMENT.,"These are your fatal seats, and this your Troy.’"
5263,THE ARGUMENT.,Time calls you now; the precious hour employ:
5264,THE ARGUMENT.,"Slack not the good presage, while Heav’n inspires"
5265,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our minds to dare, and gives the ready fires."
5266,THE ARGUMENT.,See! Neptune’s altars minister their brands:
5267,THE ARGUMENT.,The god is pleas’d; the god supplies our hands.”
5268,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then from the pile a flaming fire she drew,"
5269,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, toss’d in air, amidst the galleys threw."
5270,THE ARGUMENT.,
5271,THE ARGUMENT.,"Wrapp’d in amaze, the matrons wildly stare:"
5272,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Pyrgo, reverenc’d for her hoary hair,"
5273,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pyrgo, the nurse of Priam’s num’rous race:"
5274,THE ARGUMENT.,"“No Beroe this, tho’ she belies her face!"
5275,THE ARGUMENT.,What terrors from her frowning front arise!
5276,THE ARGUMENT.,Behold a goddess in her ardent eyes!
5277,THE ARGUMENT.,What rays around her heav’nly face are seen!
5278,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mark her majestic voice, and more than mortal mien!"
5279,THE ARGUMENT.,"Beroe but now I left, whom, pin’d with pain,"
5280,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her age and anguish from these rites detain,”"
5281,THE ARGUMENT.,"She said. The matrons, seiz’d with new amaze,"
5282,THE ARGUMENT.,"Roll their malignant eyes, and on the navy gaze."
5283,THE ARGUMENT.,"They fear, and hope, and neither part obey:"
5284,THE ARGUMENT.,"They hope the fated land, but fear the fatal way."
5285,THE ARGUMENT.,"The goddess, having done her task below,"
5286,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mounts up on equal wings, and bends her painted bow."
5287,THE ARGUMENT.,"Struck with the sight, and seiz’d with rage divine,"
5288,THE ARGUMENT.,The matrons prosecute their mad design:
5289,THE ARGUMENT.,"They shriek aloud; they snatch, with impious hands,"
5290,THE ARGUMENT.,The food of altars; fires and flaming brands.
5291,THE ARGUMENT.,"Green boughs and saplings, mingled in their haste,"
5292,THE ARGUMENT.,"And smoking torches, on the ships they cast."
5293,THE ARGUMENT.,"The flame, unstopp’d at first, more fury gains,"
5294,THE ARGUMENT.,And Vulcan rides at large with loosen’d reins:
5295,THE ARGUMENT.,"Triumphant to the painted sterns he soars,"
5296,THE ARGUMENT.,"And seizes, in this way, the banks and crackling oars."
5297,THE ARGUMENT.,"Eumelus was the first the news to bear,"
5298,THE ARGUMENT.,While yet they crowd the rural theatre.
5299,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, what they hear, is witness’d by their eyes:"
5300,THE ARGUMENT.,A storm of sparkles and of flames arise.
5301,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ascanius took th’ alarm, while yet he led"
5302,THE ARGUMENT.,"His early warriors on his prancing steed,"
5303,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, spurring on, his equals soon o’erpass’d;"
5304,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor could his frighted friends reclaim his haste.
5305,THE ARGUMENT.,"Soon as the royal youth appear’d in view,"
5306,THE ARGUMENT.,He sent his voice before him as he flew:
5307,THE ARGUMENT.,"“What madness moves you, matrons, to destroy"
5308,THE ARGUMENT.,The last remainders of unhappy Troy!
5309,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not hostile fleets, but your own hopes, you burn,"
5310,THE ARGUMENT.,And on your friends your fatal fury turn.
5311,THE ARGUMENT.,"Behold your own Ascanius!” While he said,"
5312,THE ARGUMENT.,"He drew his glitt’ring helmet from his head,"
5313,THE ARGUMENT.,In which the youths to sportful arms he led.
5314,THE ARGUMENT.,"By this, Aeneas and his train appear;"
5315,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now the women, seiz’d with shame and fear,"
5316,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dispers’d, to woods and caverns take their flight,"
5317,THE ARGUMENT.,"Abhor their actions, and avoid the light;"
5318,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their friends acknowledge, and their error find,"
5319,THE ARGUMENT.,And shake the goddess from their alter’d mind.
5320,THE ARGUMENT.,
5321,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not so the raging fires their fury cease,"
5322,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, lurking in the seams, with seeming peace,"
5323,THE ARGUMENT.,"Work on their way amid the smould’ring tow,"
5324,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sure in destruction, but in motion slow."
5325,THE ARGUMENT.,"The silent plague thro’ the green timber eats,"
5326,THE ARGUMENT.,And vomits out a tardy flame by fits.
5327,THE ARGUMENT.,"Down to the keels, and upward to the sails,"
5328,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fire descends, or mounts, but still prevails;"
5329,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor buckets pour’d, nor strength of human hand,"
5330,THE ARGUMENT.,Can the victorious element withstand.
5331,THE ARGUMENT.,
5332,THE ARGUMENT.,"The pious hero rends his robe, and throws"
5333,THE ARGUMENT.,"To heav’n his hands, and with his hands his vows."
5334,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O Jove,” he cried, “if pray’rs can yet have place;"
5335,THE ARGUMENT.,If thou abhorr’st not all the Dardan race;
5336,THE ARGUMENT.,If any spark of pity still remain;
5337,THE ARGUMENT.,"If gods are gods, and not invok’d in vain;"
5338,THE ARGUMENT.,Yet spare the relics of the Trojan train!
5339,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet from the flames our burning vessels free,"
5340,THE ARGUMENT.,Or let thy fury fall alone on me!
5341,THE ARGUMENT.,"At this devoted head thy thunder throw,"
5342,THE ARGUMENT.,And send the willing sacrifice below!”
5343,THE ARGUMENT.,
5344,THE ARGUMENT.,"Scarce had he said, when southern storms arise:"
5345,THE ARGUMENT.,From pole to pole the forky lightning flies;
5346,THE ARGUMENT.,Loud rattling shakes the mountains and the plain;
5347,THE ARGUMENT.,"Heav’n bellies downward, and descends in rain."
5348,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whole sheets of water from the clouds are sent,"
5349,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which, hissing thro’ the planks, the flames prevent,"
5350,THE ARGUMENT.,And stop the fiery pest. Four ships alone
5351,THE ARGUMENT.,"Burn to the waist, and for the fleet atone."
5352,THE ARGUMENT.,
5353,THE ARGUMENT.,But doubtful thoughts the hero’s heart divide;
5354,THE ARGUMENT.,"If he should still in Sicily reside,"
5355,THE ARGUMENT.,"Forgetful of his fates, or tempt the main,"
5356,THE ARGUMENT.,In hope the promis’d Italy to gain.
5357,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Nautes, old and wise, to whom alone"
5358,THE ARGUMENT.,The will of Heav’n by Pallas was foreshown;
5359,THE ARGUMENT.,"Vers’d in portents, experienc’d, and inspir’d"
5360,THE ARGUMENT.,"To tell events, and what the fates requir’d;"
5361,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus while he stood, to neither part inclin’d,"
5362,THE ARGUMENT.,With cheerful words reliev’d his lab’ring mind:
5363,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O goddess-born, resign’d in ev’ry state,"
5364,THE ARGUMENT.,"With patience bear, with prudence push your fate."
5365,THE ARGUMENT.,"By suff’ring well, our Fortune we subdue;"
5366,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fly when she frowns, and, when she calls, pursue."
5367,THE ARGUMENT.,Your friend Acestes is of Trojan kind;
5368,THE ARGUMENT.,To him disclose the secrets of your mind:
5369,THE ARGUMENT.,Trust in his hands your old and useless train;
5370,THE ARGUMENT.,Too num’rous for the ships which yet remain:
5371,THE ARGUMENT.,"The feeble, old, indulgent of their ease,"
5372,THE ARGUMENT.,"The dames who dread the dangers of the seas,"
5373,THE ARGUMENT.,"With all the dastard crew, who dare not stand"
5374,THE ARGUMENT.,The shock of battle with your foes by land.
5375,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here you may build a common town for all,"
5376,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, from Acestes’ name, Acesta call.”"
5377,THE ARGUMENT.,"The reasons, with his friend’s experience join’d,"
5378,THE ARGUMENT.,"Encourag’d much, but more disturb’d his mind."
5379,THE ARGUMENT.,
5380,THE ARGUMENT.,’Twas dead of night; when to his slumb’ring eyes
5381,THE ARGUMENT.,"His father’s shade descended from the skies,"
5382,THE ARGUMENT.,"And thus he spoke: “O more than vital breath,"
5383,THE ARGUMENT.,"Lov’d while I liv’d, and dear ev’n after death;"
5384,THE ARGUMENT.,"O son, in various toils and troubles toss’d,"
5385,THE ARGUMENT.,The King of Heav’n employs my careful ghost
5386,THE ARGUMENT.,"On his commands: the god, who sav’d from fire"
5387,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your flaming fleet, and heard your just desire."
5388,THE ARGUMENT.,"The wholesome counsel of your friend receive,"
5389,THE ARGUMENT.,And here the coward train and woman leave:
5390,THE ARGUMENT.,"The chosen youth, and those who nobly dare,"
5391,THE ARGUMENT.,"Transport, to tempt the dangers of the war."
5392,THE ARGUMENT.,The stern Italians will their courage try;
5393,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rough are their manners, and their minds are high."
5394,THE ARGUMENT.,"But first to Pluto’s palace you shall go,"
5395,THE ARGUMENT.,And seek my shade among the blest below:
5396,THE ARGUMENT.,"For not with impious ghosts my soul remains,"
5397,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor suffers with the damn’d perpetual pains,"
5398,THE ARGUMENT.,But breathes the living air of soft Elysian plains.
5399,THE ARGUMENT.,"The chaste Sibylla shall your steps convey,"
5400,THE ARGUMENT.,And blood of offer’d victims free the way.
5401,THE ARGUMENT.,"There shall you know what realms the gods assign,"
5402,THE ARGUMENT.,And learn the fates and fortunes of your line.
5403,THE ARGUMENT.,"But now, farewell! I vanish with the night,"
5404,THE ARGUMENT.,And feel the blast of heav’n’s approaching light.”
5405,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said, and mix’d with shades, and took his airy flight."
5406,THE ARGUMENT.,“Whither so fast?” the filial duty cried;
5407,THE ARGUMENT.,"“And why, ah why, the wish’d embrace denied?”"
5408,THE ARGUMENT.,
5409,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said, and rose; as holy zeal inspires,"
5410,THE ARGUMENT.,"He rakes hot embers, and renews the fires;"
5411,THE ARGUMENT.,His country gods and Vesta then adores
5412,THE ARGUMENT.,"With cakes and incense, and their aid implores."
5413,THE ARGUMENT.,"Next, for his friends and royal host he sent,"
5414,THE ARGUMENT.,"Reveal’d his vision, and the gods’ intent,"
5415,THE ARGUMENT.,"With his own purpose. All, without delay,"
5416,THE ARGUMENT.,"The will of Jove, and his desires obey."
5417,THE ARGUMENT.,"They list with women each degenerate name,"
5418,THE ARGUMENT.,Who dares not hazard life for future fame.
5419,THE ARGUMENT.,"These they cashier: the brave remaining few,"
5420,THE ARGUMENT.,"Oars, banks, and cables, half consum’d, renew."
5421,THE ARGUMENT.,The prince designs a city with the plow;
5422,THE ARGUMENT.,The lots their sev’ral tenements allow.
5423,THE ARGUMENT.,"This part is nam’d from Ilium, that from Troy,"
5424,THE ARGUMENT.,And the new king ascends the throne with joy;
5425,THE ARGUMENT.,A chosen senate from the people draws;
5426,THE ARGUMENT.,"Appoints the judges, and ordains the laws."
5427,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, on the top of Eryx, they begin"
5428,THE ARGUMENT.,A rising temple to the Paphian queen.
5429,THE ARGUMENT.,"Anchises, last, is honour’d as a god;"
5430,THE ARGUMENT.,"A priest is added, annual gifts bestow’d,"
5431,THE ARGUMENT.,And groves are planted round his blest abode.
5432,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nine days they pass in feasts, their temples crown’d;"
5433,THE ARGUMENT.,And fumes of incense in the fanes abound.
5434,THE ARGUMENT.,Then from the south arose a gentle breeze
5435,THE ARGUMENT.,That curl’d the smoothness of the glassy seas;
5436,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rising winds a ruffling gale afford,"
5437,THE ARGUMENT.,And call the merry mariners aboard.
5438,THE ARGUMENT.,
5439,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now loud laments along the shores resound,"
5440,THE ARGUMENT.,Of parting friends in close embraces bound.
5441,THE ARGUMENT.,"The trembling women, the degenerate train,"
5442,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who shunn’d the frightful dangers of the main,"
5443,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ev’n those desire to sail, and take their share"
5444,THE ARGUMENT.,Of the rough passage and the promis’d war:
5445,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whom good Aeneas cheers, and recommends"
5446,THE ARGUMENT.,To their new master’s care his fearful friends.
5447,THE ARGUMENT.,On Eryx’s altars three fat calves he lays;
5448,THE ARGUMENT.,A lamb new-fallen to the stormy seas;
5449,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then slips his haulsers, and his anchors weighs."
5450,THE ARGUMENT.,"High on the deck the godlike hero stands,"
5451,THE ARGUMENT.,"With olive crown’d, a charger in his hands;"
5452,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then cast the reeking entrails in the brine,"
5453,THE ARGUMENT.,And pour’d the sacrifice of purple wine.
5454,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fresh gales arise; with equal strokes they vie,"
5455,THE ARGUMENT.,"And brush the buxom seas, and o’er the billows fly."
5456,THE ARGUMENT.,
5457,THE ARGUMENT.,"Meantime the mother goddess, full of fears,"
5458,THE ARGUMENT.,"To Neptune thus address’d, with tender tears:"
5459,THE ARGUMENT.,"“The pride of Jove’s imperious queen, the rage,"
5460,THE ARGUMENT.,"The malice which no suff’rings can assuage,"
5461,THE ARGUMENT.,"Compel me to these pray’rs; since neither fate,"
5462,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor time, nor pity, can remove her hate:"
5463,THE ARGUMENT.,Ev’n Jove is thwarted by his haughty wife;
5464,THE ARGUMENT.,"Still vanquish’d, yet she still renews the strife."
5465,THE ARGUMENT.,As if ’twere little to consume the town
5466,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which aw’d the world, and wore th’ imperial crown,"
5467,THE ARGUMENT.,"She prosecutes the ghost of Troy with pains,"
5468,THE ARGUMENT.,"And gnaws, ev’n to the bones, the last remains."
5469,THE ARGUMENT.,Let her the causes of her hatred tell;
5470,THE ARGUMENT.,But you can witness its effects too well.
5471,THE ARGUMENT.,"You saw the storm she rais’d on Libyan floods,"
5472,THE ARGUMENT.,That mix’d the mounting billows with the clouds;
5473,THE ARGUMENT.,"When, bribing Aeolus, she shook the main,"
5474,THE ARGUMENT.,And mov’d rebellion in your wat’ry reign.
5475,THE ARGUMENT.,"With fury she possess’d the Dardan dames,"
5476,THE ARGUMENT.,"To burn their fleet with execrable flames,"
5477,THE ARGUMENT.,"And forc’d Aeneas, when his ships were lost,"
5478,THE ARGUMENT.,To leave his foll’wers on a foreign coast.
5479,THE ARGUMENT.,"For what remains, your godhead I implore,"
5480,THE ARGUMENT.,And trust my son to your protecting pow’r.
5481,THE ARGUMENT.,"If neither Jove’s nor Fate’s decree withstand,"
5482,THE ARGUMENT.,Secure his passage to the Latian land.”
5483,THE ARGUMENT.,
5484,THE ARGUMENT.,Then thus the mighty Ruler of the Main:
5485,THE ARGUMENT.,“What may not Venus hope from Neptune’s reign?
5486,THE ARGUMENT.,My kingdom claims your birth; my late defence
5487,THE ARGUMENT.,Of your indanger’d fleet may claim your confidence.
5488,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor less by land than sea my deeds declare
5489,THE ARGUMENT.,How much your lov’d Aeneas is my care.
5490,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thee, Xanthus, and thee, Simois, I attest."
5491,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your Trojan troops when proud Achilles press’d,"
5492,THE ARGUMENT.,"And drove before him headlong on the plain,"
5493,THE ARGUMENT.,And dash’d against the walls the trembling train;
5494,THE ARGUMENT.,When floods were fill’d with bodies of the slain;
5495,THE ARGUMENT.,"When crimson Xanthus, doubtful of his way,"
5496,THE ARGUMENT.,Stood up on ridges to behold the sea;
5497,THE ARGUMENT.,"New heaps came tumbling in, and chok’d his way;"
5498,THE ARGUMENT.,"When your Aeneas fought, but fought with odds"
5499,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of force unequal, and unequal gods;"
5500,THE ARGUMENT.,"I spread a cloud before the victor’s sight,"
5501,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sustain’d the vanquish’d, and secur’d his flight;"
5502,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ev’n then secur’d him, when I sought with joy"
5503,THE ARGUMENT.,The vow’d destruction of ungrateful Troy.
5504,THE ARGUMENT.,"My will’s the same: fair goddess, fear no more,"
5505,THE ARGUMENT.,Your fleet shall safely gain the Latian shore;
5506,THE ARGUMENT.,Their lives are giv’n; one destin’d head alone
5507,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shall perish, and for multitudes atone.”"
5508,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus having arm’d with hopes her anxious mind,"
5509,THE ARGUMENT.,"His finny team Saturnian Neptune join’d,"
5510,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then adds the foamy bridle to their jaws,"
5511,THE ARGUMENT.,And to the loosen’d reins permits the laws.
5512,THE ARGUMENT.,High on the waves his azure car he guides;
5513,THE ARGUMENT.,"Its axles thunder, and the sea subsides,"
5514,THE ARGUMENT.,And the smooth ocean rolls her silent tides.
5515,THE ARGUMENT.,"The tempests fly before their father’s face,"
5516,THE ARGUMENT.,"Trains of inferior gods his triumph grace,"
5517,THE ARGUMENT.,"And monster whales before their master play,"
5518,THE ARGUMENT.,And choirs of Tritons crowd the wat’ry way.
5519,THE ARGUMENT.,The marshal’d pow’rs in equal troops divide
5520,THE ARGUMENT.,To right and left; the gods his better side
5521,THE ARGUMENT.,"Inclose, and on the worse the Nymphs and Nereids ride."
5522,THE ARGUMENT.,
5523,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now smiling hope, with sweet vicissitude,"
5524,THE ARGUMENT.,Within the hero’s mind his joys renew’d.
5525,THE ARGUMENT.,"He calls to raise the masts, the sheets display;"
5526,THE ARGUMENT.,The cheerful crew with diligence obey;
5527,THE ARGUMENT.,"They scud before the wind, and sail in open sea."
5528,THE ARGUMENT.,Ahead of all the master pilot steers;
5529,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, as he leads, the following navy veers."
5530,THE ARGUMENT.,"The steeds of Night had travel’d half the sky,"
5531,THE ARGUMENT.,"The drowsy rowers on their benches lie,"
5532,THE ARGUMENT.,"When the soft God of Sleep, with easy flight,"
5533,THE ARGUMENT.,"Descends, and draws behind a trail of light."
5534,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thou, Palinurus, art his destin’d prey;"
5535,THE ARGUMENT.,To thee alone he takes his fatal way.
5536,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dire dreams to thee, and iron sleep, he bears;"
5537,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, lighting on thy prow, the form of Phorbas wears."
5538,THE ARGUMENT.,Then thus the traitor god began his tale:
5539,THE ARGUMENT.,"“The winds, my friend, inspire a pleasing gale;"
5540,THE ARGUMENT.,"The ships, without thy care, securely sail."
5541,THE ARGUMENT.,Now steal an hour of sweet repose; and I
5542,THE ARGUMENT.,Will take the rudder and thy room supply.”
5543,THE ARGUMENT.,"To whom the yawning pilot, half asleep:"
5544,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Me dost thou bid to trust the treach’rous deep,"
5545,THE ARGUMENT.,"The harlot smiles of her dissembling face,"
5546,THE ARGUMENT.,And to her faith commit the Trojan race?
5547,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shall I believe the Siren South again,"
5548,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, oft betray’d, not know the monster main?”"
5549,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said: his fasten’d hands the rudder keep,"
5550,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, fix’d on heav’n, his eyes repel invading sleep."
5551,THE ARGUMENT.,"The god was wroth, and at his temples threw"
5552,THE ARGUMENT.,"A branch in Lethe dipp’d, and drunk with Stygian dew:"
5553,THE ARGUMENT.,"The pilot, vanquish’d by the pow’r divine,"
5554,THE ARGUMENT.,"Soon clos’d his swimming eyes, and lay supine."
5555,THE ARGUMENT.,"Scarce were his limbs extended at their length,"
5556,THE ARGUMENT.,"The god, insulting with superior strength,"
5557,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fell heavy on him, plung’d him in the sea,"
5558,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, with the stern, the rudder tore away."
5559,THE ARGUMENT.,"Headlong he fell, and, struggling in the main,"
5560,THE ARGUMENT.,"Cried out for helping hands, but cried in vain."
5561,THE ARGUMENT.,"The victor daemon mounts obscure in air,"
5562,THE ARGUMENT.,While the ship sails without the pilot’s care.
5563,THE ARGUMENT.,On Neptune’s faith the floating fleet relies;
5564,THE ARGUMENT.,"But what the man forsook, the god supplies,"
5565,THE ARGUMENT.,And o’er the dang’rous deep secure the navy flies;
5566,THE ARGUMENT.,"Glides by the Sirens’ cliffs, a shelfy coast,"
5567,THE ARGUMENT.,"Long infamous for ships and sailors lost,"
5568,THE ARGUMENT.,"And white with bones. Th’ impetuous ocean roars,"
5569,THE ARGUMENT.,And rocks rebellow from the sounding shores.
5570,THE ARGUMENT.,"The watchful hero felt the knocks, and found"
5571,THE ARGUMENT.,The tossing vessel sail’d on shoaly ground.
5572,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sure of his pilot’s loss, he takes himself"
5573,THE ARGUMENT.,"The helm, and steers aloof, and shuns the shelf."
5574,THE ARGUMENT.,"Inly he griev’d, and, groaning from the breast,"
5575,THE ARGUMENT.,Deplor’d his death; and thus his pain express’d:
5576,THE ARGUMENT.,"“For faith repos’d on seas, and on the flatt’ring sky,"
5577,THE ARGUMENT.,Thy naked corpse is doom’d on shores unknown to lie.”

5584,THE ARGUMENT.,
5585,THE ARGUMENT.,
5586,THE ARGUMENT.,The Sibyl foretells Aeneas the adventures he should meet with in
5587,THE ARGUMENT.,Italy. She attends him to hell; describing to him the various
5588,THE ARGUMENT.,"scenes of that place, and conducting him to his father Anchises,"
5589,THE ARGUMENT.,"who instructs him in those sublime mysteries, of the soul of the"
5590,THE ARGUMENT.,"world, and the transmigration; and shows him that glorious race"
5591,THE ARGUMENT.,"of heroes, which was to descend from him and his posterity."
5592,THE ARGUMENT.,
5593,THE ARGUMENT.,
5594,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said, and wept; then spread his sails before"
5595,THE ARGUMENT.,"The winds, and reach’d at length the Cumaean shore:"
5596,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their anchors dropp’d, his crew the vessels moor."
5597,THE ARGUMENT.,"They turn their heads to sea, their sterns to land,"
5598,THE ARGUMENT.,And greet with greedy joy th’ Italian strand.
5599,THE ARGUMENT.,Some strike from clashing flints their fiery seed;
5600,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some gather sticks, the kindled flames to feed,"
5601,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or search for hollow trees, and fell the woods,"
5602,THE ARGUMENT.,Or trace thro’ valleys the discover’d floods.
5603,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus, while their sev’ral charges they fulfil,"
5604,THE ARGUMENT.,The pious prince ascends the sacred hill
5605,THE ARGUMENT.,Where Phoebus is ador’d; and seeks the shade
5606,THE ARGUMENT.,Which hides from sight his venerable maid.
5607,THE ARGUMENT.,Deep in a cave the Sibyl makes abode;
5608,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thence full of fate returns, and of the god."
5609,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thro’ Trivia’s grove they walk; and now behold,"
5610,THE ARGUMENT.,"And enter now, the temple roof’d with gold."
5611,THE ARGUMENT.,"When Daedalus, to fly the Cretan shore,"
5612,THE ARGUMENT.,"His heavy limbs on jointed pinions bore,"
5613,THE ARGUMENT.,"(The first who sail’d in air,) ’tis sung by Fame,"
5614,THE ARGUMENT.,"To the Cumaean coast at length he came,"
5615,THE ARGUMENT.,"And here alighting, built this costly frame."
5616,THE ARGUMENT.,"Inscrib’d to Phoebus, here he hung on high"
5617,THE ARGUMENT.,"The steerage of his wings, that cut the sky:"
5618,THE ARGUMENT.,Then o’er the lofty gate his art emboss’d
5619,THE ARGUMENT.,"Androgeos’ death, and off’rings to his ghost;"
5620,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sev’n youths from Athens yearly sent, to meet"
5621,THE ARGUMENT.,The fate appointed by revengeful Crete.
5622,THE ARGUMENT.,"And next to those the dreadful urn was plac’d,"
5623,THE ARGUMENT.,In which the destin’d names by lots were cast:
5624,THE ARGUMENT.,"The mournful parents stand around in tears,"
5625,THE ARGUMENT.,And rising Crete against their shore appears.
5626,THE ARGUMENT.,"There too, in living sculpture, might be seen"
5627,THE ARGUMENT.,The mad affection of the Cretan queen;
5628,THE ARGUMENT.,Then how she cheats her bellowing lover’s eye;
5629,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rushing leap, the doubtful progeny,"
5630,THE ARGUMENT.,"The lower part a beast, a man above,"
5631,THE ARGUMENT.,The monument of their polluted love.
5632,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not far from thence he grav’d the wondrous maze,"
5633,THE ARGUMENT.,"A thousand doors, a thousand winding ways:"
5634,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here dwells the monster, hid from human view,"
5635,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not to be found, but by the faithful clue;"
5636,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till the kind artist, mov’d with pious grief,"
5637,THE ARGUMENT.,"Lent to the loving maid this last relief,"
5638,THE ARGUMENT.,And all those erring paths describ’d so well
5639,THE ARGUMENT.,That Theseus conquer’d and the monster fell.
5640,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here hapless Icarus had found his part,"
5641,THE ARGUMENT.,Had not the father’s grief restrain’d his art.
5642,THE ARGUMENT.,He twice assay’d to cast his son in gold;
5643,THE ARGUMENT.,Twice from his hands he dropp’d the forming mould.
5644,THE ARGUMENT.,
5645,THE ARGUMENT.,All this with wond’ring eyes Aeneas view’d;
5646,THE ARGUMENT.,Each varying object his delight renew’d:
5647,THE ARGUMENT.,"Eager to read the rest, Achates came,"

5654,THE ARGUMENT.,"This said, the servants urge the sacred rites,"
5655,THE ARGUMENT.,While to the temple she the prince invites.
5656,THE ARGUMENT.,"A spacious cave, within its farmost part,"
5657,THE ARGUMENT.,Was hew’d and fashion’d by laborious art
5658,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thro’ the hill’s hollow sides: before the place,"
5659,THE ARGUMENT.,A hundred doors a hundred entries grace;
5660,THE ARGUMENT.,"As many voices issue, and the sound"
5661,THE ARGUMENT.,Of Sybil’s words as many times rebound.
5662,THE ARGUMENT.,Now to the mouth they come. Aloud she cries:
5663,THE ARGUMENT.,“This is the time; enquire your destinies.
5664,THE ARGUMENT.,"He comes; behold the god!” Thus while she said,"
5665,THE ARGUMENT.,"(And shiv’ring at the sacred entry stay’d,)"
5666,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her colour chang’d; her face was not the same,"
5667,THE ARGUMENT.,And hollow groans from her deep spirit came.
5668,THE ARGUMENT.,Her hair stood up; convulsive rage possess’d
5669,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her trembling limbs, and heav’d her lab’ring breast."
5670,THE ARGUMENT.,"Greater than humankind she seem’d to look,"
5671,THE ARGUMENT.,And with an accent more than mortal spoke.
5672,THE ARGUMENT.,Her staring eyes with sparkling fury roll;
5673,THE ARGUMENT.,When all the god came rushing on her soul.
5674,THE ARGUMENT.,"Swiftly she turn’d, and, foaming as she spoke:"
5675,THE ARGUMENT.,“Why this delay?” she cried; “the pow’rs invoke!
5676,THE ARGUMENT.,Thy pray’rs alone can open this abode;
5677,THE ARGUMENT.,"Else vain are my demands, and dumb the god.”"
5678,THE ARGUMENT.,
5679,THE ARGUMENT.,"She said no more. The trembling Trojans hear,"

5681,THE ARGUMENT.,"The prince himself, with awful dread possess’d,"
5682,THE ARGUMENT.,His vows to great Apollo thus address’d:
5683,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Indulgent god, propitious pow’r to Troy,"
5684,THE ARGUMENT.,"Swift to relieve, unwilling to destroy,"
5685,THE ARGUMENT.,Directed by whose hand the Dardan dart
5686,THE ARGUMENT.,Pierc’d the proud Grecian’s only mortal part:
5687,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus far, by fate’s decrees and thy commands,"
5688,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thro’ ambient seas and thro’ devouring sands,"
5689,THE ARGUMENT.,Our exil’d crew has sought th’ Ausonian ground;
5690,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now, at length, the flying coast is found."
5691,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus far the fate of Troy, from place to place,"
5692,THE ARGUMENT.,With fury has pursued her wand’ring race.
5693,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here cease, ye pow’rs, and let your vengeance end:"
5694,THE ARGUMENT.,"Troy is no more, and can no more offend."
5695,THE ARGUMENT.,"And thou, O sacred maid, inspir’d to see"

5711,THE ARGUMENT.,But O! commit not thy prophetic mind
5712,THE ARGUMENT.,"To flitting leaves, the sport of ev’ry wind,"
5713,THE ARGUMENT.,Lest they disperse in air our empty fate;
5714,THE ARGUMENT.,"Write not, but, what the pow’rs ordain, relate.”"
5715,THE ARGUMENT.,
5716,THE ARGUMENT.,"Struggling in vain, impatient of her load,"
5717,THE ARGUMENT.,"And lab’ring underneath the pond’rous god,"
5718,THE ARGUMENT.,"The more she strove to shake him from her breast,"
5719,THE ARGUMENT.,With more and far superior force he press’d;

5721,THE ARGUMENT.,Usurps her organs and inspires her soul.
5722,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, with a furious blast, the hundred doors"

5724,THE ARGUMENT.,"Within the cave, and Sibyl’s voice restores:"
5725,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Escap’d the dangers of the wat’ry reign,"
5726,THE ARGUMENT.,Yet more and greater ills by land remain.
5727,THE ARGUMENT.,"The coast, so long desir’d (nor doubt th’ event),"
5728,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy troops shall reach, but, having reach’d, repent."
5729,THE ARGUMENT.,"Wars, horrid wars, I view; a field of blood,"
5730,THE ARGUMENT.,And Tiber rolling with a purple flood.
5731,THE ARGUMENT.,Simois nor Xanthus shall be wanting there:
5732,THE ARGUMENT.,"A new Achilles shall in arms appear,"
5733,THE ARGUMENT.,"And he, too, goddess-born. Fierce Juno’s hate,"
5734,THE ARGUMENT.,"Added to hostile force, shall urge thy fate."
5735,THE ARGUMENT.,"To what strange nations shalt not thou resort,"
5736,THE ARGUMENT.,Driv’n to solicit aid at ev’ry court!
5737,THE ARGUMENT.,The cause the same which Ilium once oppress’d;
5738,THE ARGUMENT.,"A foreign mistress, and a foreign guest."
5739,THE ARGUMENT.,"But thou, secure of soul, unbent with woes,"
5740,THE ARGUMENT.,"The more thy fortune frowns, the more oppose."
5741,THE ARGUMENT.,The dawnings of thy safety shall be shown
5742,THE ARGUMENT.,"From whence thou least shalt hope, a Grecian town.”"
5743,THE ARGUMENT.,
5744,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus, from the dark recess, the Sibyl spoke,"
5745,THE ARGUMENT.,And the resisting air the thunder broke;
5746,THE ARGUMENT.,"The cave rebellow’d, and the temple shook."
5747,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ ambiguous god, who rul’d her lab’ring breast,"
5748,THE ARGUMENT.,In these mysterious words his mind express’d;
5749,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some truths reveal’d, in terms involv’d the rest."
5750,THE ARGUMENT.,"At length her fury fell, her foaming ceas’d,"
5751,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, ebbing in her soul, the god decreas’d."
5752,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then thus the chief: “No terror to my view,"
5753,THE ARGUMENT.,No frightful face of danger can be new.
5754,THE ARGUMENT.,"Inur’d to suffer, and resolv’d to dare,"
5755,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Fates, without my pow’r, shall be without my care."
5756,THE ARGUMENT.,"This let me crave, since near your grove the road"
5757,THE ARGUMENT.,"To hell lies open, and the dark abode"
5758,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which Acheron surrounds, th’ innavigable flood;"
5759,THE ARGUMENT.,"Conduct me thro’ the regions void of light,"
5760,THE ARGUMENT.,And lead me longing to my father’s sight.
5761,THE ARGUMENT.,"For him, a thousand dangers I have sought,"
5762,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, rushing where the thickest Grecians fought,"
5763,THE ARGUMENT.,Safe on my back the sacred burthen brought.
5764,THE ARGUMENT.,"He, for my sake, the raging ocean tried,"
5765,THE ARGUMENT.,"And wrath of Heav’n, my still auspicious guide,"
5766,THE ARGUMENT.,And bore beyond the strength decrepid age supplied.
5767,THE ARGUMENT.,"Oft, since he breath’d his last, in dead of night"
5768,THE ARGUMENT.,His reverend image stood before my sight;
5769,THE ARGUMENT.,"Enjoin’d to seek, below, his holy shade;"
5770,THE ARGUMENT.,Conducted there by your unerring aid.
5771,THE ARGUMENT.,"But you, if pious minds by pray’rs are won,"
5772,THE ARGUMENT.,"Oblige the father, and protect the son."
5773,THE ARGUMENT.,Yours is the pow’r; nor Proserpine in vain
5774,THE ARGUMENT.,Has made you priestess of her nightly reign.
5775,THE ARGUMENT.,"If Orpheus, arm’d with his enchanting lyre,"
5776,THE ARGUMENT.,"The ruthless king with pity could inspire,"
5777,THE ARGUMENT.,And from the shades below redeem his wife;
5778,THE ARGUMENT.,"If Pollux, off’ring his alternate life,"
5779,THE ARGUMENT.,"Could free his brother, and can daily go"
5780,THE ARGUMENT.,"By turns aloft, by turns descend below:"
5781,THE ARGUMENT.,"Why name I Theseus, or his greater friend,"
5782,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who trod the downward path, and upward could ascend?"
5783,THE ARGUMENT.,Not less than theirs from Jove my lineage came;
5784,THE ARGUMENT.,"My mother greater, my descent the same.”"
5785,THE ARGUMENT.,"So pray’d the Trojan prince, and, while he pray’d,"
5786,THE ARGUMENT.,His hand upon the holy altar laid.
5787,THE ARGUMENT.,
5788,THE ARGUMENT.,Then thus replied the prophetess divine:
5789,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O goddess-born of great Anchises’ line,"
5790,THE ARGUMENT.,The gates of hell are open night and day;
5791,THE ARGUMENT.,"Smooth the descent, and easy is the way:"
5792,THE ARGUMENT.,"But to return, and view the cheerful skies,"
5793,THE ARGUMENT.,In this the task and mighty labour lies.
5794,THE ARGUMENT.,"To few great Jupiter imparts this grace,"
5795,THE ARGUMENT.,And those of shining worth and heav’nly race.
5796,THE ARGUMENT.,"Betwixt those regions and our upper light,"
5797,THE ARGUMENT.,Deep forests and impenetrable night
5798,THE ARGUMENT.,Possess the middle space: th’ infernal bounds
5799,THE ARGUMENT.,"Cocytus, with his sable waves, surrounds."
5800,THE ARGUMENT.,"But if so dire a love your soul invades,"
5801,THE ARGUMENT.,As twice below to view the trembling shades;
5802,THE ARGUMENT.,"If you so hard a toil will undertake,"
5803,THE ARGUMENT.,As twice to pass th’ innavigable lake;
5804,THE ARGUMENT.,Receive my counsel. In the neighb’ring grove
5805,THE ARGUMENT.,There stands a tree; the queen of Stygian Jove
5806,THE ARGUMENT.,Claims it her own; thick woods and gloomy night
5807,THE ARGUMENT.,Conceal the happy plant from human sight.
5808,THE ARGUMENT.,One bough it bears; but wondrous to behold!
5809,THE ARGUMENT.,The ductile rind and leaves of radiant gold:
5810,THE ARGUMENT.,"This from the vulgar branches must be torn,"
5811,THE ARGUMENT.,"And to fair Proserpine the present borne,"
5812,THE ARGUMENT.,Ere leave be giv’n to tempt the nether skies.
5813,THE ARGUMENT.,"The first thus rent a second will arise,"
5814,THE ARGUMENT.,And the same metal the same room supplies.
5815,THE ARGUMENT.,"Look round the wood, with lifted eyes, to see"
5816,THE ARGUMENT.,The lurking gold upon the fatal tree:
5817,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then rend it off, as holy rites command;"
5818,THE ARGUMENT.,"The willing metal will obey thy hand,"
5819,THE ARGUMENT.,"Following with ease, if favour’d by thy fate,"
5820,THE ARGUMENT.,Thou art foredoom’d to view the Stygian state:
5821,THE ARGUMENT.,"If not, no labour can the tree constrain;"
5822,THE ARGUMENT.,And strength of stubborn arms and steel are vain.
5823,THE ARGUMENT.,"Besides, you know not, while you here attend,"
5824,THE ARGUMENT.,Th’ unworthy fate of your unhappy friend:
5825,THE ARGUMENT.,"Breathless he lies; and his unburied ghost,"
5826,THE ARGUMENT.,"Depriv’d of fun’ral rites, pollutes your host."
5827,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pay first his pious dues; and, for the dead,"
5828,THE ARGUMENT.,Two sable sheep around his hearse be led;
5829,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, living turfs upon his body lay:"
5830,THE ARGUMENT.,"This done, securely take the destin’d way,"
5831,THE ARGUMENT.,To find the regions destitute of day.”
5832,THE ARGUMENT.,
5833,THE ARGUMENT.,"She said, and held her peace. Aeneas went"
5834,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sad from the cave, and full of discontent,"
5835,THE ARGUMENT.,Unknowing whom the sacred Sibyl meant.
5836,THE ARGUMENT.,"Achates, the companion of his breast,"
5837,THE ARGUMENT.,"Goes grieving by his side, with equal cares oppress’d."
5838,THE ARGUMENT.,"Walking, they talk’d, and fruitlessly divin’d"
5839,THE ARGUMENT.,What friend the priestess by those words design’d.
5840,THE ARGUMENT.,But soon they found an object to deplore:
5841,THE ARGUMENT.,Misenus lay extended on the shore;
5842,THE ARGUMENT.,Son of the God of Winds: none so renown’d
5843,THE ARGUMENT.,The warrior trumpet in the field to sound;
5844,THE ARGUMENT.,"With breathing brass to kindle fierce alarms,"
5845,THE ARGUMENT.,And rouse to dare their fate in honourable arms.
5846,THE ARGUMENT.,"He serv’d great Hector, and was ever near,"
5847,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not with his trumpet only, but his spear."
5848,THE ARGUMENT.,"But by Pelides’ arms when Hector fell,"
5849,THE ARGUMENT.,He chose Aeneas; and he chose as well.
5850,THE ARGUMENT.,"Swoln with applause, and aiming still at more,"
5851,THE ARGUMENT.,He now provokes the sea gods from the shore;
5852,THE ARGUMENT.,"With envy Triton heard the martial sound,"
5853,THE ARGUMENT.,"And the bold champion, for his challenge, drown’d;"
5854,THE ARGUMENT.,Then cast his mangled carcass on the strand:
5855,THE ARGUMENT.,The gazing crowd around the body stand.
5856,THE ARGUMENT.,"All weep; but most Aeneas mourns his fate,"
5857,THE ARGUMENT.,And hastens to perform the funeral state.
5858,THE ARGUMENT.,"In altar-wise, a stately pile they rear;"
5859,THE ARGUMENT.,"The basis broad below, and top advanc’d in air."
5860,THE ARGUMENT.,"An ancient wood, fit for the work design’d,"
5861,THE ARGUMENT.,"(The shady covert of the salvage kind,)"
5862,THE ARGUMENT.,The Trojans found: the sounding ax is plied;
5863,THE ARGUMENT.,"Firs, pines, and pitch trees, and the tow’ring pride"
5864,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of forest ashes, feel the fatal stroke,"
5865,THE ARGUMENT.,And piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak.
5866,THE ARGUMENT.,"Huge trunks of trees, fell’d from the steepy crown"
5867,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of the bare mountains, roll with ruin down."
5868,THE ARGUMENT.,"Arm’d like the rest the Trojan prince appears,"
5869,THE ARGUMENT.,And by his pious labour urges theirs.
5870,THE ARGUMENT.,
5871,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus while he wrought, revolving in his mind"
5872,THE ARGUMENT.,"The ways to compass what his wish design’d,"
5873,THE ARGUMENT.,"He cast his eyes upon the gloomy grove,"
5874,THE ARGUMENT.,And then with vows implor’d the Queen of Love:
5875,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O may thy pow’r, propitious still to me,"
5876,THE ARGUMENT.,"Conduct my steps to find the fatal tree,"
5877,THE ARGUMENT.,In this deep forest; since the Sibyl’s breath
5878,THE ARGUMENT.,"Foretold, alas! too true, Misenus’ death.”"
5879,THE ARGUMENT.,"Scarce had he said, when, full before his sight,"
5880,THE ARGUMENT.,"Two doves, descending from their airy flight,"
5881,THE ARGUMENT.,Secure upon the grassy plain alight.
5882,THE ARGUMENT.,He knew his mother’s birds; and thus he pray’d:
5883,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Be you my guides, with your auspicious aid,"
5884,THE ARGUMENT.,"And lead my footsteps, till the branch be found,"
5885,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose glitt’ring shadow gilds the sacred ground.
5886,THE ARGUMENT.,"And thou, great parent, with celestial care,"
5887,THE ARGUMENT.,In this distress be present to my pray’r!”
5888,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus having said, he stopp’d with watchful sight,"
5889,THE ARGUMENT.,"Observing still the motions of their flight,"
5890,THE ARGUMENT.,"What course they took, what happy signs they shew."
5891,THE ARGUMENT.,"They fed, and, flutt’ring, by degrees withdrew"
5892,THE ARGUMENT.,"Still farther from the place, but still in view:"
5893,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hopping and flying, thus they led him on"
5894,THE ARGUMENT.,"To the slow lake, whose baleful stench to shun"
5895,THE ARGUMENT.,"They wing’d their flight aloft; then, stooping low,"
5896,THE ARGUMENT.,Perch’d on the double tree that bears the golden bough.
5897,THE ARGUMENT.,Thro’ the green leafs the glitt’ring shadows glow;
5898,THE ARGUMENT.,"As, on the sacred oak, the wintry mistletoe,"
5899,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where the proud mother views her precious brood,"
5900,THE ARGUMENT.,"And happier branches, which she never sow’d."
5901,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such was the glitt’ring; such the ruddy rind,"
5902,THE ARGUMENT.,"And dancing leaves, that wanton’d in the wind."
5903,THE ARGUMENT.,"He seiz’d the shining bough with griping hold,"
5904,THE ARGUMENT.,"And rent away, with ease, the ling’ring gold;"
5905,THE ARGUMENT.,Then to the Sibyl’s palace bore the prize.
5906,THE ARGUMENT.,"Meantime the Trojan troops, with weeping eyes,"
5907,THE ARGUMENT.,To dead Misenus pay his obsequies.
5908,THE ARGUMENT.,"First, from the ground a lofty pile they rear,"
5909,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of pitch trees, oaks, and pines, and unctuous fir:"
5910,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fabric’s front with cypress twigs they strew,"
5911,THE ARGUMENT.,And stick the sides with boughs of baleful yew.
5912,THE ARGUMENT.,The topmost part his glitt’ring arms adorn;
5913,THE ARGUMENT.,"Warm waters, then, in brazen caldrons borne,"
5914,THE ARGUMENT.,"Are pour’d to wash his body, joint by joint,"
5915,THE ARGUMENT.,And fragrant oils the stiffen’d limbs anoint.
5916,THE ARGUMENT.,With groans and cries Misenus they deplore:
5917,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then on a bier, with purple cover’d o’er,"
5918,THE ARGUMENT.,"The breathless body, thus bewail’d, they lay,"
5919,THE ARGUMENT.,"And fire the pile, their faces turn’d away:"
5920,THE ARGUMENT.,Such reverend rites their fathers us’d to pay.
5921,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pure oil and incense on the fire they throw,"
5922,THE ARGUMENT.,"And fat of victims, which his friends bestow."
5923,THE ARGUMENT.,These gifts the greedy flames to dust devour;
5924,THE ARGUMENT.,Then on the living coals red wine they pour;
5925,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, last, the relics by themselves dispose,"
5926,THE ARGUMENT.,Which in a brazen urn the priests inclose.
5927,THE ARGUMENT.,"Old Corynaeus compass’d thrice the crew,"
5928,THE ARGUMENT.,And dipp’d an olive branch in holy dew;
5929,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which thrice he sprinkled round, and thrice aloud"
5930,THE ARGUMENT.,"Invok’d the dead, and then dismissed the crowd."
5931,THE ARGUMENT.,But good Aeneas order’d on the shore
5932,THE ARGUMENT.,"A stately tomb, whose top a trumpet bore,"
5933,THE ARGUMENT.,"A soldier’s falchion, and a seaman’s oar."
5934,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus was his friend interr’d; and deathless fame
5935,THE ARGUMENT.,Still to the lofty cape consigns his name.
5936,THE ARGUMENT.,"These rites perform’d, the prince, without delay,"
5937,THE ARGUMENT.,Hastes to the nether world his destin’d way.
5938,THE ARGUMENT.,"Deep was the cave; and, downward as it went"
5939,THE ARGUMENT.,"From the wide mouth, a rocky rough descent;"
5940,THE ARGUMENT.,"And here th’ access a gloomy grove defends,"
5941,THE ARGUMENT.,"And there th’ unnavigable lake extends,"
5942,THE ARGUMENT.,"O’er whose unhappy waters, void of light,"
5943,THE ARGUMENT.,No bird presumes to steer his airy flight;
5944,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such deadly stenches from the depths arise,"
5945,THE ARGUMENT.,"And steaming sulphur, that infects the skies."
5946,THE ARGUMENT.,"From hence the Grecian bards their legends make,"
5947,THE ARGUMENT.,And give the name Avernus to the lake.
5948,THE ARGUMENT.,"Four sable bullocks, in the yoke untaught,"
5949,THE ARGUMENT.,For sacrifice the pious hero brought.
5950,THE ARGUMENT.,The priestess pours the wine betwixt their horns;
5951,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then cuts the curling hair; that first oblation burns,"
5952,THE ARGUMENT.,Invoking Hecate hither to repair:
5953,THE ARGUMENT.,A pow’rful name in hell and upper air.
5954,THE ARGUMENT.,The sacred priests with ready knives bereave
5955,THE ARGUMENT.,"The beasts of life, and in full bowls receive"
5956,THE ARGUMENT.,The streaming blood: a lamb to Hell and Night
5957,THE ARGUMENT.,(The sable wool without a streak of white)
5958,THE ARGUMENT.,"Aeneas offers; and, by fate’s decree,"
5959,THE ARGUMENT.,"A barren heifer, Proserpine, to thee,"
5960,THE ARGUMENT.,With holocausts he Pluto’s altar fills;
5961,THE ARGUMENT.,Sev’n brawny bulls with his own hand he kills;
5962,THE ARGUMENT.,Then on the broiling entrails oil he pours;
5963,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which, ointed thus, the raging flame devours."
5964,THE ARGUMENT.,"Late the nocturnal sacrifice begun,"
5965,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor ended till the next returning sun.
5966,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then earth began to bellow, trees to dance,"
5967,THE ARGUMENT.,"And howling dogs in glimm’ring light advance,"
5968,THE ARGUMENT.,Ere Hecate came. “Far hence be souls profane!”
5969,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Sibyl cried, “and from the grove abstain!"
5970,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, Trojan, take the way thy fates afford;"
5971,THE ARGUMENT.,"Assume thy courage, and unsheathe thy sword.”"
5972,THE ARGUMENT.,"She said, and pass’d along the gloomy space;"
5973,THE ARGUMENT.,The prince pursued her steps with equal pace.
5974,THE ARGUMENT.,
5975,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ye realms, yet unreveal’d to human sight,"
5976,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ye gods who rule the regions of the night,"
5977,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ye gliding ghosts, permit me to relate"
5978,THE ARGUMENT.,The mystic wonders of your silent state!
5979,THE ARGUMENT.,
5980,THE ARGUMENT.,"Obscure they went thro’ dreary shades, that led"
5981,THE ARGUMENT.,Along the waste dominions of the dead.
5982,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus wander travelers in woods by night,"
5983,THE ARGUMENT.,"By the moon’s doubtful and malignant light,"
5984,THE ARGUMENT.,"When Jove in dusky clouds involves the skies,"
5985,THE ARGUMENT.,And the faint crescent shoots by fits before their eyes.
5986,THE ARGUMENT.,
5987,THE ARGUMENT.,"Just in the gate and in the jaws of hell,"
5988,THE ARGUMENT.,"Revengeful Cares and sullen Sorrows dwell,"
5989,THE ARGUMENT.,"And pale Diseases, and repining Age,"
5990,THE ARGUMENT.,"Want, Fear, and Famine’s unresisted rage;"
5991,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here Toils, and Death, and Death’s half-brother, Sleep,"
5992,THE ARGUMENT.,"Forms terrible to view, their sentry keep;"
5993,THE ARGUMENT.,"With anxious Pleasures of a guilty mind,"
5994,THE ARGUMENT.,"Deep Frauds before, and open Force behind;"
5995,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Furies’ iron beds; and Strife, that shakes"
5996,THE ARGUMENT.,Her hissing tresses and unfolds her snakes.
5997,THE ARGUMENT.,"Full in the midst of this infernal road,"
5998,THE ARGUMENT.,An elm displays her dusky arms abroad:
5999,THE ARGUMENT.,"The God of Sleep there hides his heavy head,"
6000,THE ARGUMENT.,And empty dreams on ev’ry leaf are spread.
6001,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of various forms unnumber’d spectres more,"
6002,THE ARGUMENT.,"Centaurs, and double shapes, besiege the door."
6003,THE ARGUMENT.,"Before the passage, horrid Hydra stands,"
6004,THE ARGUMENT.,And Briareus with all his hundred hands;
6005,THE ARGUMENT.,"Gorgons, Geryon with his triple frame;"
6006,THE ARGUMENT.,And vain Chimaera vomits empty flame.
6007,THE ARGUMENT.,"The chief unsheath’d his shining steel, prepar’d,"
6008,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tho’ seiz’d with sudden fear, to force the guard,"
6009,THE ARGUMENT.,Off’ring his brandish’d weapon at their face;
6010,THE ARGUMENT.,"Had not the Sibyl stopp’d his eager pace,"
6011,THE ARGUMENT.,And told him what those empty phantoms were:
6012,THE ARGUMENT.,"Forms without bodies, and impassive air."
6013,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hence to deep Acheron they take their way,"
6014,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whose troubled eddies, thick with ooze and clay,"
6015,THE ARGUMENT.,"Are whirl’d aloft, and in Cocytus lost."
6016,THE ARGUMENT.,"There Charon stands, who rules the dreary coast:"
6017,THE ARGUMENT.,A sordid god: down from his hoary chin
6018,THE ARGUMENT.,"A length of beard descends, uncomb’d, unclean;"
6019,THE ARGUMENT.,"His eyes, like hollow furnaces on fire;"
6020,THE ARGUMENT.,"A girdle, foul with grease, binds his obscene attire."
6021,THE ARGUMENT.,He spreads his canvas; with his pole he steers;
6022,THE ARGUMENT.,The freights of flitting ghosts in his thin bottom bears.
6023,THE ARGUMENT.,He look’d in years; yet in his years were seen
6024,THE ARGUMENT.,A youthful vigour and autumnal green.
6025,THE ARGUMENT.,"An airy crowd came rushing where he stood,"
6026,THE ARGUMENT.,Which fill’d the margin of the fatal flood:
6027,THE ARGUMENT.,"Husbands and wives, boys and unmarried maids,"
6028,THE ARGUMENT.,"And mighty heroes’ more majestic shades,"
6029,THE ARGUMENT.,"And youths, intomb’d before their fathers’ eyes,"
6030,THE ARGUMENT.,"With hollow groans, and shrieks, and feeble cries."
6031,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thick as the leaves in autumn strow the woods,"
6032,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or fowls, by winter forc’d, forsake the floods,"
6033,THE ARGUMENT.,And wing their hasty flight to happier lands;
6034,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such, and so thick, the shiv’ring army stands,"
6035,THE ARGUMENT.,And press for passage with extended hands.
6036,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now these, now those, the surly boatman bore:"
6037,THE ARGUMENT.,The rest he drove to distance from the shore.
6038,THE ARGUMENT.,"The hero, who beheld with wond’ring eyes"
6039,THE ARGUMENT.,"The tumult mix’d with shrieks, laments, and cries,"
6040,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ask’d of his guide, what the rude concourse meant;"
6041,THE ARGUMENT.,Why to the shore the thronging people bent;
6042,THE ARGUMENT.,What forms of law among the ghosts were us’d;
6043,THE ARGUMENT.,"Why some were ferried o’er, and some refus’d."
6044,THE ARGUMENT.,
6045,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Son of Anchises, offspring of the gods,”"
6046,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Sibyl said, “you see the Stygian floods,"
6047,THE ARGUMENT.,The sacred stream which heav’n’s imperial state
6048,THE ARGUMENT.,"Attests in oaths, and fears to violate."
6049,THE ARGUMENT.,The ghosts rejected are th’ unhappy crew
6050,THE ARGUMENT.,Depriv’d of sepulchers and fun’ral due:
6051,THE ARGUMENT.,"The boatman, Charon; those, the buried host,"
6052,THE ARGUMENT.,He ferries over to the farther coast;
6053,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor dares his transport vessel cross the waves
6054,THE ARGUMENT.,With such whose bones are not compos’d in graves.
6055,THE ARGUMENT.,A hundred years they wander on the shore;
6056,THE ARGUMENT.,"At length, their penance done, are wafted o’er.”"
6057,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojan chief his forward pace repress’d,"
6058,THE ARGUMENT.,"Revolving anxious thoughts within his breast,"
6059,THE ARGUMENT.,"He saw his friends, who, whelm’d beneath the waves,"
6060,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their fun’ral honours claim’d, and ask’d their quiet graves."
6061,THE ARGUMENT.,"The lost Leucaspis in the crowd he knew,"
6062,THE ARGUMENT.,"And the brave leader of the Lycian crew,"
6063,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whom, on the Tyrrhene seas, the tempests met;"
6064,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sailors master’d, and the ship o’erset."
6065,THE ARGUMENT.,
6066,THE ARGUMENT.,"Amidst the spirits, Palinurus press’d,"
6067,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet fresh from life, a new-admitted guest,"
6068,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who, while he steering view’d the stars, and bore"
6069,THE ARGUMENT.,"His course from Afric to the Latian shore,"
6070,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fell headlong down. The Trojan fix’d his view,"
6071,THE ARGUMENT.,And scarcely thro’ the gloom the sullen shadow knew.
6072,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then thus the prince: “What envious pow’r, O friend,"
6073,THE ARGUMENT.,Brought your lov’d life to this disastrous end?
6074,THE ARGUMENT.,"For Phoebus, ever true in all he said,"
6075,THE ARGUMENT.,Has in your fate alone my faith betray’d.
6076,THE ARGUMENT.,"The god foretold you should not die, before"
6077,THE ARGUMENT.,"You reach’d, secure from seas, th’ Italian shore."
6078,THE ARGUMENT.,Is this th’ unerring pow’r?” The ghost replied;
6079,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Nor Phoebus flatter’d, nor his answers lied;"
6080,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor envious gods have sent me to the deep:
6081,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, while the stars and course of heav’n I keep,"
6082,THE ARGUMENT.,My wearied eyes were seiz’d with fatal sleep.
6083,THE ARGUMENT.,"I fell; and, with my weight, the helm constrain’d"
6084,THE ARGUMENT.,"Was drawn along, which yet my gripe retain’d."
6085,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now by the winds and raging waves I swear,"
6086,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your safety, more than mine, was then my care;"
6087,THE ARGUMENT.,"Lest, of the guide bereft, the rudder lost,"
6088,THE ARGUMENT.,Your ship should run against the rocky coast.
6089,THE ARGUMENT.,"Three blust’ring nights, borne by the southern blast,"
6090,THE ARGUMENT.,"I floated, and discover’d land at last:"
6091,THE ARGUMENT.,"High on a mounting wave my head I bore,"
6092,THE ARGUMENT.,"Forcing my strength, and gath’ring to the shore."
6093,THE ARGUMENT.,"Panting, but past the danger, now I seiz’d"
6094,THE ARGUMENT.,"The craggy cliffs, and my tir’d members eas’d."
6095,THE ARGUMENT.,"While, cumber’d with my dropping clothes, I lay,"
6096,THE ARGUMENT.,"The cruel nation, covetous of prey,"
6097,THE ARGUMENT.,Stain’d with my blood th’ unhospitable coast;
6098,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now, by winds and waves, my lifeless limbs are toss’d:"
6099,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which O avert, by yon ethereal light,"
6100,THE ARGUMENT.,Which I have lost for this eternal night!
6101,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or, if by dearer ties you may be won,"
6102,THE ARGUMENT.,"By your dead sire, and by your living son,"
6103,THE ARGUMENT.,Redeem from this reproach my wand’ring ghost;
6104,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or with your navy seek the Velin coast,"
6105,THE ARGUMENT.,And in a peaceful grave my corpse compose;
6106,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or, if a nearer way your mother shows,"
6107,THE ARGUMENT.,Without whose aid you durst not undertake
6108,THE ARGUMENT.,"This frightful passage o’er the Stygian lake,"
6109,THE ARGUMENT.,"Lend to this wretch your hand, and waft him o’er"
6110,THE ARGUMENT.,To the sweet banks of yon forbidden shore.”
6111,THE ARGUMENT.,"Scarce had he said, the prophetess began:"
6112,THE ARGUMENT.,"“What hopes delude thee, miserable man?"
6113,THE ARGUMENT.,"Think’st thou, thus unintomb’d, to cross the floods,"
6114,THE ARGUMENT.,"To view the Furies and infernal gods,"
6115,THE ARGUMENT.,"And visit, without leave, the dark abodes?"
6116,THE ARGUMENT.,Attend the term of long revolving years;
6117,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fate, and the dooming gods, are deaf to tears."
6118,THE ARGUMENT.,This comfort of thy dire misfortune take:
6119,THE ARGUMENT.,"The wrath of Heav’n, inflicted for thy sake,"
6120,THE ARGUMENT.,"With vengeance shall pursue th’ inhuman coast,"
6121,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till they propitiate thy offended ghost,"
6122,THE ARGUMENT.,"And raise a tomb, with vows and solemn pray’r;"
6123,THE ARGUMENT.,And Palinurus’ name the place shall bear.”
6124,THE ARGUMENT.,"This calm’d his cares; sooth’d with his future fame,"
6125,THE ARGUMENT.,And pleas’d to hear his propagated name.
6126,THE ARGUMENT.,
6127,THE ARGUMENT.,Now nearer to the Stygian lake they draw:
6128,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whom, from the shore, the surly boatman saw;"
6129,THE ARGUMENT.,"Observ’d their passage thro’ the shady wood,"
6130,THE ARGUMENT.,And mark’d their near approaches to the flood.
6131,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then thus he call’d aloud, inflam’d with wrath:"
6132,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Mortal, whate’er, who this forbidden path"
6133,THE ARGUMENT.,"In arms presum’st to tread, I charge thee, stand,"
6134,THE ARGUMENT.,"And tell thy name, and bus’ness in the land."
6135,THE ARGUMENT.,"Know this, the realm of night; the Stygian shore:"
6136,THE ARGUMENT.,My boat conveys no living bodies o’er;
6137,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor was I pleas’d great Theseus once to bear,"
6138,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who forc’d a passage with his pointed spear,"
6139,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor strong Alcides, men of mighty fame,"
6140,THE ARGUMENT.,And from th’ immortal gods their lineage came.
6141,THE ARGUMENT.,"In fetters one the barking porter tied,"
6142,THE ARGUMENT.,And took him trembling from his sov’reign’s side:
6143,THE ARGUMENT.,Two sought by force to seize his beauteous bride.”
6144,THE ARGUMENT.,To whom the Sibyl thus: “Compose thy mind;
6145,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor frauds are here contriv’d, nor force design’d."
6146,THE ARGUMENT.,Still may the dog the wand’ring troops constrain
6147,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of airy ghosts, and vex the guilty train,"
6148,THE ARGUMENT.,And with her grisly lord his lovely queen remain.
6149,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojan chief, whose lineage is from Jove,"
6150,THE ARGUMENT.,"Much fam’d for arms, and more for filial love,"
6151,THE ARGUMENT.,Is sent to seek his sire in your Elysian grove.
6152,THE ARGUMENT.,"If neither piety, nor Heav’n’s command,"
6153,THE ARGUMENT.,"Can gain his passage to the Stygian strand,"
6154,THE ARGUMENT.,This fatal present shall prevail at least.”
6155,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then shew’d the shining bough, conceal’d within her vest."
6156,THE ARGUMENT.,No more was needful: for the gloomy god
6157,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stood mute with awe, to see the golden rod;"
6158,THE ARGUMENT.,Admir’d the destin’d off’ring to his queen;
6159,THE ARGUMENT.,"A venerable gift, so rarely seen."
6160,THE ARGUMENT.,"His fury thus appeas’d, he puts to land;"
6161,THE ARGUMENT.,The ghosts forsake their seats at his command:
6162,THE ARGUMENT.,"He clears the deck, receives the mighty freight;"
6163,THE ARGUMENT.,The leaky vessel groans beneath the weight.
6164,THE ARGUMENT.,"Slowly she sails, and scarcely stems the tides;"
6165,THE ARGUMENT.,The pressing water pours within her sides.
6166,THE ARGUMENT.,"His passengers at length are wafted o’er,"
6167,THE ARGUMENT.,"Expos’d, in muddy weeds, upon the miry shore."
6168,THE ARGUMENT.,
6169,THE ARGUMENT.,"No sooner landed, in his den they found"
6170,THE ARGUMENT.,"The triple porter of the Stygian sound,"
6171,THE ARGUMENT.,"Grim Cerberus, who soon began to rear"
6172,THE ARGUMENT.,"His crested snakes, and arm’d his bristling hair."
6173,THE ARGUMENT.,The prudent Sibyl had before prepar’d
6174,THE ARGUMENT.,"A sop, in honey steep’d, to charm the guard;"
6175,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which, mix’d with pow’rful drugs, she cast before"
6176,THE ARGUMENT.,"His greedy grinning jaws, just op’d to roar."
6177,THE ARGUMENT.,"With three enormous mouths he gapes; and straight,"
6178,THE ARGUMENT.,"With hunger press’d, devours the pleasing bait."
6179,THE ARGUMENT.,Long draughts of sleep his monstrous limbs enslave;
6180,THE ARGUMENT.,"He reels, and, falling, fills the spacious cave."
6181,THE ARGUMENT.,"The keeper charm’d, the chief without delay"
6182,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pass’d on, and took th’ irremeable way."
6183,THE ARGUMENT.,"Before the gates, the cries of babes new born,"
6184,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whom fate had from their tender mothers torn,"
6185,THE ARGUMENT.,"Assault his ears: then those, whom form of laws"
6186,THE ARGUMENT.,"Condemn’d to die, when traitors judg’d their cause."
6187,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor want they lots, nor judges to review"
6188,THE ARGUMENT.,"The wrongful sentence, and award a new."
6189,THE ARGUMENT.,"Minos, the strict inquisitor, appears;"
6190,THE ARGUMENT.,"And lives and crimes, with his assessors, hears."
6191,THE ARGUMENT.,"Round in his urn the blended balls he rolls,"
6192,THE ARGUMENT.,"Absolves the just, and dooms the guilty souls."
6193,THE ARGUMENT.,"The next, in place and punishment, are they"
6194,THE ARGUMENT.,Who prodigally throw their souls away;
6195,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fools, who, repining at their wretched state,"
6196,THE ARGUMENT.,"And loathing anxious life, suborn’d their fate."
6197,THE ARGUMENT.,With late repentance now they would retrieve
6198,THE ARGUMENT.,"The bodies they forsook, and wish to live;"
6199,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their pains and poverty desire to bear,"
6200,THE ARGUMENT.,"To view the light of heav’n, and breathe the vital air:"
6201,THE ARGUMENT.,"But fate forbids; the Stygian floods oppose,"
6202,THE ARGUMENT.,And with circling streams the captive souls inclose.
6203,THE ARGUMENT.,
6204,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not far from thence, the Mournful Fields appear"
6205,THE ARGUMENT.,So call’d from lovers that inhabit there.
6206,THE ARGUMENT.,"The souls whom that unhappy flame invades,"
6207,THE ARGUMENT.,In secret solitude and myrtle shades
6208,THE ARGUMENT.,"Make endless moans, and, pining with desire,"
6209,THE ARGUMENT.,Lament too late their unextinguish’d fire.
6210,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here Procris, Eriphyle here he found,"
6211,THE ARGUMENT.,"Baring her breast, yet bleeding with the wound"
6212,THE ARGUMENT.,"Made by her son. He saw Pasiphae there,"
6213,THE ARGUMENT.,"With Phaedra’s ghost, a foul incestuous pair."
6214,THE ARGUMENT.,"There Laodamia, with Evadne, moves,"
6215,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unhappy both, but loyal in their loves:"
6216,THE ARGUMENT.,"Caeneus, a woman once, and once a man,"
6217,THE ARGUMENT.,But ending in the sex she first began.
6218,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not far from these Phoenician Dido stood,"
6219,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fresh from her wound, her bosom bath’d in blood;"
6220,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whom when the Trojan hero hardly knew,"
6221,THE ARGUMENT.,"Obscure in shades, and with a doubtful view,"
6222,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Doubtful as he who sees, thro’ dusky night,"
6223,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or thinks he sees, the moon’s uncertain light,)"
6224,THE ARGUMENT.,With tears he first approach’d the sullen shade;
6225,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, as his love inspir’d him, thus he said:"
6226,THE ARGUMENT.,“Unhappy queen! then is the common breath
6227,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of rumour true, in your reported death,"
6228,THE ARGUMENT.,"And I, alas! the cause? By Heav’n, I vow,"
6229,THE ARGUMENT.,"And all the pow’rs that rule the realms below,"
6230,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unwilling I forsook your friendly state,"
6231,THE ARGUMENT.,"Commanded by the gods, and forc’d by fate."
6232,THE ARGUMENT.,"Those gods, that fate, whose unresisted might"
6233,THE ARGUMENT.,"Have sent me to these regions void of light,"
6234,THE ARGUMENT.,Thro’ the vast empire of eternal night.
6235,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor dar’d I to presume, that, press’d with grief,"
6236,THE ARGUMENT.,My flight should urge you to this dire relief.
6237,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stay, stay your steps, and listen to my vows:"
6238,THE ARGUMENT.,’Tis the last interview that fate allows!”
6239,THE ARGUMENT.,In vain he thus attempts her mind to move
6240,THE ARGUMENT.,"With tears, and pray’rs, and late-repenting love."
6241,THE ARGUMENT.,"Disdainfully she look’d; then turning round,"
6242,THE ARGUMENT.,"But fix’d her eyes unmov’d upon the ground,"
6243,THE ARGUMENT.,"And what he says and swears, regards no more"
6244,THE ARGUMENT.,"Than the deaf rocks, when the loud billows roar;"
6245,THE ARGUMENT.,"But whirl’d away, to shun his hateful sight,"
6246,THE ARGUMENT.,Hid in the forest and the shades of night;
6247,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then sought Sichaeus thro’ the shady grove,"
6248,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who answer’d all her cares, and equal’d all her love."
6249,THE ARGUMENT.,
6250,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some pious tears the pitying hero paid,"
6251,THE ARGUMENT.,"And follow’d with his eyes the flitting shade,"
6252,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then took the forward way, by fate ordain’d,"
6253,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, with his guide, the farther fields attain’d,"
6254,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where, sever’d from the rest, the warrior souls remain’d."
6255,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tydeus he met, with Meleager’s race,"
6256,THE ARGUMENT.,"The pride of armies, and the soldiers’ grace;"
6257,THE ARGUMENT.,And pale Adrastus with his ghastly face.
6258,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of Trojan chiefs he view’d a num’rous train,"
6259,THE ARGUMENT.,"All much lamented, all in battle slain;"
6260,THE ARGUMENT.,"Glaucus and Medon, high above the rest,"
6261,THE ARGUMENT.,"Antenor’s sons, and Ceres’ sacred priest."
6262,THE ARGUMENT.,"And proud Idaeus, Priam’s charioteer,"
6263,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who shakes his empty reins, and aims his airy spear."
6264,THE ARGUMENT.,"The gladsome ghosts, in circling troops, attend"
6265,THE ARGUMENT.,And with unwearied eyes behold their friend;
6266,THE ARGUMENT.,"Delight to hover near, and long to know"
6267,THE ARGUMENT.,What bus’ness brought him to the realms below.
6268,THE ARGUMENT.,"But Argive chiefs, and Agamemnon’s train,"
6269,THE ARGUMENT.,"When his refulgent arms flash’d thro’ the shady plain,"
6270,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fled from his well-known face, with wonted fear,"
6271,THE ARGUMENT.,As when his thund’ring sword and pointed spear
6272,THE ARGUMENT.,"Drove headlong to their ships, and glean’d the routed rear."
6273,THE ARGUMENT.,"They rais’d a feeble cry, with trembling notes;"
6274,THE ARGUMENT.,But the weak voice deceiv’d their gasping throats.
6275,THE ARGUMENT.,
6276,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here Priam’s son, Deiphobus, he found,"
6277,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose face and limbs were one continued wound:
6278,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dishonest, with lopp’d arms, the youth appears,"
6279,THE ARGUMENT.,"Spoil’d of his nose, and shorten’d of his ears."
6280,THE ARGUMENT.,"He scarcely knew him, striving to disown"
6281,THE ARGUMENT.,"His blotted form, and blushing to be known;"
6282,THE ARGUMENT.,"And therefore first began: “O Teucer’s race,"
6283,THE ARGUMENT.,Who durst thy faultless figure thus deface?
6284,THE ARGUMENT.,"What heart could wish, what hand inflict, this dire disgrace?"
6285,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Twas fam’d, that in our last and fatal night"
6286,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your single prowess long sustain’d the fight,"
6287,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till tir’d, not forc’d, a glorious fate you chose,"
6288,THE ARGUMENT.,And fell upon a heap of slaughter’d foes.
6289,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, in remembrance of so brave a deed,"
6290,THE ARGUMENT.,A tomb and fun’ral honours I decreed;
6291,THE ARGUMENT.,Thrice call’d your manes on the Trojan plains:
6292,THE ARGUMENT.,The place your armour and your name retains.
6293,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your body too I sought, and, had I found,"
6294,THE ARGUMENT.,Design’d for burial in your native ground.”
6295,THE ARGUMENT.,
6296,THE ARGUMENT.,The ghost replied: “Your piety has paid
6297,THE ARGUMENT.,"All needful rites, to rest my wand’ring shade;"
6298,THE ARGUMENT.,"But cruel fate, and my more cruel wife,"
6299,THE ARGUMENT.,To Grecian swords betray’d my sleeping life.
6300,THE ARGUMENT.,These are the monuments of Helen’s love:
6301,THE ARGUMENT.,"The shame I bear below, the marks I bore above."
6302,THE ARGUMENT.,You know in what deluding joys we pass’d
6303,THE ARGUMENT.,The night that was by Heav’n decreed our last:
6304,THE ARGUMENT.,"For, when the fatal horse, descending down,"
6305,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pregnant with arms, o’erwhelm’d th’ unhappy town"
6306,THE ARGUMENT.,"She feign’d nocturnal orgies; left my bed,"
6307,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, mix’d with Trojan dames, the dances led"
6308,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, waving high her torch, the signal made,"
6309,THE ARGUMENT.,Which rous’d the Grecians from their ambuscade.
6310,THE ARGUMENT.,"With watching overworn, with cares oppress’d,"
6311,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unhappy I had laid me down to rest,"
6312,THE ARGUMENT.,And heavy sleep my weary limbs possess’d.
6313,THE ARGUMENT.,"Meantime my worthy wife our arms mislaid,"
6314,THE ARGUMENT.,And from beneath my head my sword convey’d;
6315,THE ARGUMENT.,"The door unlatch’d, and, with repeated calls,"
6316,THE ARGUMENT.,Invites her former lord within my walls.
6317,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus in her crime her confidence she plac’d,"
6318,THE ARGUMENT.,And with new treasons would redeem the past.
6319,THE ARGUMENT.,"What need I more? Into the room they ran,"
6320,THE ARGUMENT.,And meanly murder’d a defenceless man.
6321,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ulysses, basely born, first led the way."
6322,THE ARGUMENT.,"Avenging pow’rs! with justice if I pray,"
6323,THE ARGUMENT.,That fortune be their own another day!
6324,THE ARGUMENT.,"But answer you; and in your turn relate,"
6325,THE ARGUMENT.,"What brought you, living, to the Stygian state:"
6326,THE ARGUMENT.,"Driv’n by the winds and errors of the sea,"
6327,THE ARGUMENT.,Or did you Heav’n’s superior doom obey?
6328,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or tell what other chance conducts your way,"
6329,THE ARGUMENT.,"To view with mortal eyes our dark retreats,"
6330,THE ARGUMENT.,Tumults and torments of th’ infernal seats.”
6331,THE ARGUMENT.,
6332,THE ARGUMENT.,"While thus in talk the flying hours they pass,"
6333,THE ARGUMENT.,The sun had finish’d more than half his race:
6334,THE ARGUMENT.,"And they, perhaps, in words and tears had spent"
6335,THE ARGUMENT.,The little time of stay which Heav’n had lent;
6336,THE ARGUMENT.,But thus the Sibyl chides their long delay:
6337,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Night rushes down, and headlong drives the day:"
6338,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Tis here, in different paths, the way divides;"
6339,THE ARGUMENT.,The right to Pluto’s golden palace guides;
6340,THE ARGUMENT.,"The left to that unhappy region tends,"
6341,THE ARGUMENT.,Which to the depth of Tartarus descends;
6342,THE ARGUMENT.,"The seat of night profound, and punish’d fiends.”"
6343,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then thus Deiphobus: “O sacred maid,"
6344,THE ARGUMENT.,"Forbear to chide, and be your will obey’d!"
6345,THE ARGUMENT.,"Lo! to the secret shadows I retire,"
6346,THE ARGUMENT.,To pay my penance till my years expire.
6347,THE ARGUMENT.,"Proceed, auspicious prince, with glory crown’d,"
6348,THE ARGUMENT.,And born to better fates than I have found.”
6349,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said; and, while he said, his steps he turn’d"
6350,THE ARGUMENT.,"To secret shadows, and in silence mourn’d."
6351,THE ARGUMENT.,
6352,THE ARGUMENT.,"The hero, looking on the left, espied"
6353,THE ARGUMENT.,"A lofty tow’r, and strong on ev’ry side"
6354,THE ARGUMENT.,"With treble walls, which Phlegethon surrounds,"
6355,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose fiery flood the burning empire bounds;
6356,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, press’d betwixt the rocks, the bellowing noise resounds"
6357,THE ARGUMENT.,"Wide is the fronting gate, and, rais’d on high"
6358,THE ARGUMENT.,"With adamantine columns, threats the sky."
6359,THE ARGUMENT.,"Vain is the force of man, and Heav’n’s as vain,"
6360,THE ARGUMENT.,To crush the pillars which the pile sustain.
6361,THE ARGUMENT.,Sublime on these a tow’r of steel is rear’d;
6362,THE ARGUMENT.,"And dire Tisiphone there keeps the ward,"
6363,THE ARGUMENT.,"Girt in her sanguine gown, by night and day,"
6364,THE ARGUMENT.,Observant of the souls that pass the downward way.
6365,THE ARGUMENT.,"From hence are heard the groans of ghosts, the pains"
6366,THE ARGUMENT.,Of sounding lashes and of dragging chains.
6367,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojan stood astonish’d at their cries,"
6368,THE ARGUMENT.,And ask’d his guide from whence those yells arise;
6369,THE ARGUMENT.,"And what the crimes, and what the tortures were,"
6370,THE ARGUMENT.,And loud laments that rent the liquid air.
6371,THE ARGUMENT.,
6372,THE ARGUMENT.,She thus replied: “The chaste and holy race
6373,THE ARGUMENT.,Are all forbidden this polluted place.
6374,THE ARGUMENT.,"But Hecate, when she gave to rule the woods,"
6375,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then led me trembling thro’ these dire abodes,"
6376,THE ARGUMENT.,And taught the tortures of th’ avenging gods.
6377,THE ARGUMENT.,These are the realms of unrelenting fate;
6378,THE ARGUMENT.,And awful Rhadamanthus rules the state.
6379,THE ARGUMENT.,He hears and judges each committed crime;
6380,THE ARGUMENT.,"Enquires into the manner, place, and time."
6381,THE ARGUMENT.,"The conscious wretch must all his acts reveal,"
6382,THE ARGUMENT.,"Loth to confess, unable to conceal,"
6383,THE ARGUMENT.,"From the first moment of his vital breath,"
6384,THE ARGUMENT.,To his last hour of unrepenting death.
6385,THE ARGUMENT.,"Straight, o’er the guilty ghost, the Fury shakes"
6386,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sounding whip and brandishes her snakes,"
6387,THE ARGUMENT.,"And the pale sinner, with her sisters, takes."
6388,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, of itself, unfolds th’ eternal door;"
6389,THE ARGUMENT.,With dreadful sounds the brazen hinges roar.
6390,THE ARGUMENT.,"You see, before the gate, what stalking ghost"
6391,THE ARGUMENT.,"Commands the guard, what sentries keep the post."
6392,THE ARGUMENT.,"More formidable Hydra stands within,"
6393,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose jaws with iron teeth severely grin.
6394,THE ARGUMENT.,"The gaping gulf low to the centre lies,"
6395,THE ARGUMENT.,And twice as deep as earth is distant from the skies.
6396,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rivals of the gods, the Titan race,"
6397,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here, sing’d with lightning, roll within th’ unfathom’d space."
6398,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here lie th’ Alaean twins, (I saw them both,)"
6399,THE ARGUMENT.,"Enormous bodies, of gigantic growth,"
6400,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who dar’d in fight the Thund’rer to defy,"
6401,THE ARGUMENT.,"Affect his heav’n, and force him from the sky."
6402,THE ARGUMENT.,"Salmoneus, suff’ring cruel pains, I found,"
6403,THE ARGUMENT.,For emulating Jove; the rattling sound
6404,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of mimic thunder, and the glitt’ring blaze"
6405,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of pointed lightnings, and their forky rays."
6406,THE ARGUMENT.,Thro’ Elis and the Grecian towns he flew;
6407,THE ARGUMENT.,Th’ audacious wretch four fiery coursers drew:
6408,THE ARGUMENT.,"He wav’d a torch aloft, and, madly vain,"
6409,THE ARGUMENT.,Sought godlike worship from a servile train.
6410,THE ARGUMENT.,Ambitious fool! with horny hoofs to pass
6411,THE ARGUMENT.,"O’er hollow arches of resounding brass,"
6412,THE ARGUMENT.,"To rival thunder in its rapid course,"
6413,THE ARGUMENT.,And imitate inimitable force!
6414,THE ARGUMENT.,"But he, the King of Heav’n, obscure on high,"
6415,THE ARGUMENT.,"Bar’d his red arm, and, launching from the sky"
6416,THE ARGUMENT.,"His writhen bolt, not shaking empty smoke,"
6417,THE ARGUMENT.,Down to the deep abyss the flaming felon strook.
6418,THE ARGUMENT.,"There Tityus was to see, who took his birth"
6419,THE ARGUMENT.,"From heav’n, his nursing from the foodful earth."
6420,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here his gigantic limbs, with large embrace,"
6421,THE ARGUMENT.,Infold nine acres of infernal space.
6422,THE ARGUMENT.,"A rav’nous vulture, in his open’d side,"
6423,THE ARGUMENT.,Her crooked beak and cruel talons tried;
6424,THE ARGUMENT.,Still for the growing liver digg’d his breast;
6425,THE ARGUMENT.,The growing liver still supplied the feast;
6426,THE ARGUMENT.,Still are his entrails fruitful to their pains:
6427,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ immortal hunger lasts, th’ immortal food remains."
6428,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ixion and Perithous I could name,"
6429,THE ARGUMENT.,And more Thessalian chiefs of mighty fame.
6430,THE ARGUMENT.,"High o’er their heads a mould’ring rock is plac’d,"
6431,THE ARGUMENT.,"That promises a fall, and shakes at ev’ry blast."
6432,THE ARGUMENT.,"They lie below, on golden beds display’d;"
6433,THE ARGUMENT.,And genial feasts with regal pomp are made.
6434,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Queen of Furies by their sides is set,"
6435,THE ARGUMENT.,"And snatches from their mouths th’ untasted meat,"
6436,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which if they touch, her hissing snakes she rears,"
6437,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tossing her torch, and thund’ring in their ears."
6438,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then they, who brothers’ better claim disown,"
6439,THE ARGUMENT.,"Expel their parents, and usurp the throne;"
6440,THE ARGUMENT.,"Defraud their clients, and, to lucre sold,"
6441,THE ARGUMENT.,Sit brooding on unprofitable gold;
6442,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who dare not give, and ev’n refuse to lend"
6443,THE ARGUMENT.,"To their poor kindred, or a wanting friend."
6444,THE ARGUMENT.,Vast is the throng of these; nor less the train
6445,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of lustful youths, for foul adult’ry slain:"
6446,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hosts of deserters, who their honour sold,"
6447,THE ARGUMENT.,And basely broke their faith for bribes of gold.
6448,THE ARGUMENT.,"All these within the dungeon’s depth remain,"
6449,THE ARGUMENT.,"Despairing pardon, and expecting pain."
6450,THE ARGUMENT.,Ask not what pains; nor farther seek to know
6451,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their process, or the forms of law below."
6452,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some roll a weighty stone; some, laid along,"
6453,THE ARGUMENT.,"And bound with burning wires, on spokes of wheels are hung"
6454,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unhappy Theseus, doom’d for ever there,"
6455,THE ARGUMENT.,Is fix’d by fate on his eternal chair;
6456,THE ARGUMENT.,And wretched Phlegyas warns the world with cries
6457,THE ARGUMENT.,(Could warning make the world more just or wise):
6458,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘Learn righteousness, and dread th’ avenging deities.’"
6459,THE ARGUMENT.,"To tyrants others have their country sold,"
6460,THE ARGUMENT.,"Imposing foreign lords, for foreign gold;"
6461,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some have old laws repeal’d, new statutes made,"
6462,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not as the people pleas’d, but as they paid;"
6463,THE ARGUMENT.,With incest some their daughters’ bed profan’d:
6464,THE ARGUMENT.,"All dar’d the worst of ills, and, what they dar’d, attain’d."
6465,THE ARGUMENT.,"Had I a hundred mouths, a hundred tongues,"
6466,THE ARGUMENT.,"And throats of brass, inspir’d with iron lungs,"
6467,THE ARGUMENT.,"I could not half those horrid crimes repeat,"
6468,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor half the punishments those crimes have met.
6469,THE ARGUMENT.,But let us haste our voyage to pursue:
6470,THE ARGUMENT.,The walls of Pluto’s palace are in view;
6471,THE ARGUMENT.,"The gate, and iron arch above it, stands"
6472,THE ARGUMENT.,On anvils labour’d by the Cyclops’ hands.
6473,THE ARGUMENT.,"Before our farther way the Fates allow,"
6474,THE ARGUMENT.,Here must we fix on high the golden bough.”
6475,THE ARGUMENT.,

6988,THE ARGUMENT.,"A swarm of bees, that cut the liquid sky,"

6993,THE ARGUMENT.,An ancient augur prophesied from hence:
6994,THE ARGUMENT.,“Behold on Latian shores a foreign prince!

7008,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then pausing, thus his prophecy renews:"
7009,THE ARGUMENT.,"“The nymph, who scatters flaming fires around,"

7013,THE ARGUMENT.,
7014,THE ARGUMENT.,"Latinus, frighted with this dire ostent,"

7030,THE ARGUMENT.,"No sooner were his eyes in slumber bound,"

7059,THE ARGUMENT.,Behold the destin’d place of your abodes!
7060,THE ARGUMENT.,"For thus Anchises prophesied of old,"
7061,THE ARGUMENT.,And this our fatal place of rest foretold:
7062,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘When, on a foreign shore, instead of meat,"
7063,THE ARGUMENT.,"By famine forc’d, your trenchers you shall eat,"

7111,THE ARGUMENT.,
7112,THE ARGUMENT.,"Meantime the train, proceeding on their way,"
7113,THE ARGUMENT.,From far the town and lofty tow’rs survey;

7197,THE ARGUMENT.,Great as the greatest that the sun beheld.
7198,THE ARGUMENT.,"The god began our line, who rules above;"
7199,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, as our race, our king descends from Jove:"
7200,THE ARGUMENT.,"And hither are we come, by his command,"

7221,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, by my sov’reign, and his fate, I swear,"
7222,THE ARGUMENT.,"Renown’d for faith in peace, for force in war;"

7234,THE ARGUMENT.,Some small remains of what his sire possess’d.
7235,THE ARGUMENT.,"This golden charger, snatch’d from burning Troy,"
7236,THE ARGUMENT.,Anchises did in sacrifice employ;
7237,THE ARGUMENT.,This royal robe and this tiara wore
7238,THE ARGUMENT.,"Old Priam, and this golden scepter bore"
7239,THE ARGUMENT.,"In full assemblies, and in solemn games;"
7240,THE ARGUMENT.,These purple vests were weav’d by Dardan dames.”
7241,THE ARGUMENT.,
7242,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus while he spoke, Latinus roll’d around"
7243,THE ARGUMENT.,"His eyes, and fix’d a while upon the ground."
7244,THE ARGUMENT.,"Intent he seem’d, and anxious in his breast;"
7245,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not by the scepter mov’d, or kingly vest,"
7246,THE ARGUMENT.,But pond’ring future things of wondrous weight;
7247,THE ARGUMENT.,"Succession, empire, and his daughter’s fate."
7248,THE ARGUMENT.,"On these he mus’d within his thoughtful mind,"
7249,THE ARGUMENT.,And then revolv’d what Faunus had divin’d.
7250,THE ARGUMENT.,"This was the foreign prince, by fate decreed"
7251,THE ARGUMENT.,"To share his scepter, and Lavinia’s bed;"
7252,THE ARGUMENT.,This was the race that sure portents foreshew
7253,THE ARGUMENT.,"To sway the world, and land and sea subdue."
7254,THE ARGUMENT.,"At length he rais’d his cheerful head, and spoke:"
7255,THE ARGUMENT.,"“The pow’rs,” said he, “the pow’rs we both invoke,"
7256,THE ARGUMENT.,"To you, and yours, and mine, propitious be,"
7257,THE ARGUMENT.,And firm our purpose with their augury!
7258,THE ARGUMENT.,Have what you ask; your presents I receive;
7259,THE ARGUMENT.,"Land, where and when you please, with ample leave;"
7260,THE ARGUMENT.,Partake and use my kingdom as your own;
7261,THE ARGUMENT.,"All shall be yours, while I command the crown:"
7262,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, if my wish’d alliance please your king,"
7263,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tell him he should not send the peace, but bring."
7264,THE ARGUMENT.,Then let him not a friend’s embraces fear;
7265,THE ARGUMENT.,The peace is made when I behold him here.
7266,THE ARGUMENT.,"Besides this answer, tell my royal guest,"
7267,THE ARGUMENT.,I add to his commands my own request:
7268,THE ARGUMENT.,"One only daughter heirs my crown and state,"
7269,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whom not our oracles, nor Heav’n, nor fate,"
7270,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor frequent prodigies, permit to join"
7271,THE ARGUMENT.,With any native of th’ Ausonian line.
7272,THE ARGUMENT.,A foreign son-in-law shall come from far
7273,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Such is our doom), a chief renown’d in war,"
7274,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whose race shall bear aloft the Latian name,"
7275,THE ARGUMENT.,And thro’ the conquer’d world diffuse our fame.
7276,THE ARGUMENT.,"Himself to be the man the fates require,"
7277,THE ARGUMENT.,"I firmly judge, and, what I judge, desire.”"
7278,THE ARGUMENT.,
7279,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said, and then on each bestow’d a steed."
7280,THE ARGUMENT.,"Three hundred horses, in high stables fed,"
7281,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stood ready, shining all, and smoothly dress’d:"
7282,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of these he chose the fairest and the best,"
7283,THE ARGUMENT.,To mount the Trojan troop. At his command
7284,THE ARGUMENT.,"The steeds caparison’d with purple stand,"
7285,THE ARGUMENT.,"With golden trappings, glorious to behold,"
7286,THE ARGUMENT.,And champ betwixt their teeth the foaming gold.
7287,THE ARGUMENT.,Then to his absent guest the king decreed
7288,THE ARGUMENT.,"A pair of coursers born of heav’nly breed,"
7289,THE ARGUMENT.,Who from their nostrils breath’d ethereal fire;
7290,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whom Circe stole from her celestial sire,"
7291,THE ARGUMENT.,"By substituting mares produc’d on earth,"
7292,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose wombs conceiv’d a more than mortal birth.
7293,THE ARGUMENT.,"These draw the chariot which Latinus sends,"
7294,THE ARGUMENT.,And the rich present to the prince commends.
7295,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sublime on stately steeds the Trojans borne,"
7296,THE ARGUMENT.,To their expecting lord with peace return.
7297,THE ARGUMENT.,
7298,THE ARGUMENT.,"But jealous Juno, from Pachynus’ height,"
7299,THE ARGUMENT.,"As she from Argos took her airy flight,"
7300,THE ARGUMENT.,Beheld with envious eyes this hateful sight.
7301,THE ARGUMENT.,She saw the Trojan and his joyful train
7302,THE ARGUMENT.,"Descend upon the shore, desert the main,"
7303,THE ARGUMENT.,"Design a town, and, with unhop’d success,"
7304,THE ARGUMENT.,Th’ embassadors return with promis’d peace.
7305,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, pierc’d with pain, she shook her haughty head,"
7306,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sigh’d from her inward soul, and thus she said:"
7307,THE ARGUMENT.,“O hated offspring of my Phrygian foes!
7308,THE ARGUMENT.,"O fates of Troy, which Juno’s fates oppose!"
7309,THE ARGUMENT.,"Could they not fall unpitied on the plain,"
7310,THE ARGUMENT.,"But slain revive, and, taken, scape again?"
7311,THE ARGUMENT.,"When execrable Troy in ashes lay,"
7312,THE ARGUMENT.,Thro’ fires and swords and seas they forc’d their way.
7313,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then vanquish’d Juno must in vain contend,"
7314,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her rage disarm’d, her empire at an end."
7315,THE ARGUMENT.,"Breathless and tir’d, is all my fury spent?"
7316,THE ARGUMENT.,Or does my glutted spleen at length relent?
7317,THE ARGUMENT.,"As if ’twere little from their town to chase,"
7318,THE ARGUMENT.,I thro’ the seas pursued their exil’d race;
7319,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ingag’d the heav’ns, oppos’d the stormy main;"
7320,THE ARGUMENT.,"But billows roar’d, and tempests rag’d in vain."
7321,THE ARGUMENT.,"What have my Scyllas and my Syrtes done,"
7322,THE ARGUMENT.,"When these they overpass, and those they shun?"
7323,THE ARGUMENT.,"On Tiber’s shores they land, secure of fate,"
7324,THE ARGUMENT.,Triumphant o’er the storms and Juno’s hate.
7325,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mars could in mutual blood the Centaurs bathe,"
7326,THE ARGUMENT.,"And Jove himself gave way to Cynthia’s wrath,"
7327,THE ARGUMENT.,Who sent the tusky boar to Calydon;
7328,THE ARGUMENT.,What great offence had either people done?
7329,THE ARGUMENT.,"But I, the consort of the Thunderer,"
7330,THE ARGUMENT.,"Have wag’d a long and unsuccessful war,"
7331,THE ARGUMENT.,"With various arts and arms in vain have toil’d,"
7332,THE ARGUMENT.,And by a mortal man at length am foil’d.
7333,THE ARGUMENT.,"If native pow’r prevail not, shall I doubt"
7334,THE ARGUMENT.,To seek for needful succour from without?
7335,THE ARGUMENT.,"If Jove and Heav’n my just desires deny,"
7336,THE ARGUMENT.,Hell shall the pow’r of Heav’n and Jove supply.
7337,THE ARGUMENT.,"Grant that the Fates have firm’d, by their decree,"
7338,THE ARGUMENT.,The Trojan race to reign in Italy;
7339,THE ARGUMENT.,"At least I can defer the nuptial day,"
7340,THE ARGUMENT.,And with protracted wars the peace delay:
7341,THE ARGUMENT.,"With blood the dear alliance shall be bought,"
7342,THE ARGUMENT.,And both the people near destruction brought;
7343,THE ARGUMENT.,"So shall the son-in-law and father join,"
7344,THE ARGUMENT.,"With ruin, war, and waste of either line."
7345,THE ARGUMENT.,"O fatal maid, thy marriage is endow’d"
7346,THE ARGUMENT.,"With Phrygian, Latian, and Rutulian blood!"
7347,THE ARGUMENT.,Bellona leads thee to thy lover’s hand;
7348,THE ARGUMENT.,"Another queen brings forth another brand,"
7349,THE ARGUMENT.,To burn with foreign fires another land!
7350,THE ARGUMENT.,"A second Paris, diff’ring but in name,"
7351,THE ARGUMENT.,Shall fire his country with a second flame.”
7352,THE ARGUMENT.,
7353,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus having said, she sinks beneath the ground,"
7354,THE ARGUMENT.,"With furious haste, and shoots the Stygian sound,"
7355,THE ARGUMENT.,To rouse Alecto from th’ infernal seat
7356,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of her dire sisters, and their dark retreat."
7357,THE ARGUMENT.,"This Fury, fit for her intent, she chose;"
7358,THE ARGUMENT.,One who delights in wars and human woes.
7359,THE ARGUMENT.,Ev’n Pluto hates his own misshapen race;
7360,THE ARGUMENT.,Her sister Furies fly her hideous face;
7361,THE ARGUMENT.,"So frightful are the forms the monster takes,"
7362,THE ARGUMENT.,So fierce the hissings of her speckled snakes.
7363,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her Juno finds, and thus inflames her spite:"
7364,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O virgin daughter of eternal Night,"
7365,THE ARGUMENT.,"Give me this once thy labour, to sustain"
7366,THE ARGUMENT.,"My right, and execute my just disdain."
7367,THE ARGUMENT.,"Let not the Trojans, with a feign’d pretence"
7368,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of proffer’d peace, delude the Latian prince."
7369,THE ARGUMENT.,"Expel from Italy that odious name,"
7370,THE ARGUMENT.,And let not Juno suffer in her fame.
7371,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Tis thine to ruin realms, o’erturn a state,"
7372,THE ARGUMENT.,"Betwixt the dearest friends to raise debate,"
7373,THE ARGUMENT.,And kindle kindred blood to mutual hate.
7374,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy hand o’er towns the fun’ral torch displays,"
7375,THE ARGUMENT.,And forms a thousand ills ten thousand ways.
7376,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now shake, out thy fruitful breast, the seeds"
7377,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of envy, discord, and of cruel deeds:"
7378,THE ARGUMENT.,"Confound the peace establish’d, and prepare"
7379,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their souls to hatred, and their hands to war.”"
7380,THE ARGUMENT.,
7381,THE ARGUMENT.,"Smear’d as she was with black Gorgonian blood,"
7382,THE ARGUMENT.,The Fury sprang above the Stygian flood;
7383,THE ARGUMENT.,"And on her wicker wings, sublime thro’ night,"
7384,THE ARGUMENT.,She to the Latian palace took her flight:
7385,THE ARGUMENT.,"There sought the queen’s apartment, stood before"
7386,THE ARGUMENT.,"The peaceful threshold, and besieg’d the door."
7387,THE ARGUMENT.,"Restless Amata lay, her swelling breast"
7388,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fir’d with disdain for Turnus dispossess’d,"
7389,THE ARGUMENT.,And the new nuptials of the Trojan guest.
7390,THE ARGUMENT.,From her black bloody locks the Fury shakes
7391,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her darling plague, the fav’rite of her snakes;"
7392,THE ARGUMENT.,"With her full force she threw the poisonous dart,"
7393,THE ARGUMENT.,"And fix’d it deep within Amata’s heart,"
7394,THE ARGUMENT.,"That, thus envenom’d, she might kindle rage,"
7395,THE ARGUMENT.,And sacrifice to strife her house and husband’s age.
7396,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unseen, unfelt, the fiery serpent skims"
7397,THE ARGUMENT.,Betwixt her linen and her naked limbs;
7398,THE ARGUMENT.,"His baleful breath inspiring, as he glides,"
7399,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now like a chain around her neck he rides,"
7400,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now like a fillet to her head repairs,"
7401,THE ARGUMENT.,And with his circling volumes folds her hairs.
7402,THE ARGUMENT.,"At first the silent venom slid with ease,"
7403,THE ARGUMENT.,And seiz’d her cooler senses by degrees;
7404,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, ere th’ infected mass was fir’d too far,"
7405,THE ARGUMENT.,"In plaintive accents she began the war,"
7406,THE ARGUMENT.,"And thus bespoke her husband: “Shall,” she said,"
7407,THE ARGUMENT.,“A wand’ring prince enjoy Lavinia’s bed?
7408,THE ARGUMENT.,"If nature plead not in a parent’s heart,"
7409,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pity my tears, and pity her desert."
7410,THE ARGUMENT.,"I know, my dearest lord, the time will come,"
7411,THE ARGUMENT.,"You’d in vain, reverse your cruel doom;"
7412,THE ARGUMENT.,"The faithless pirate soon will set to sea,"
7413,THE ARGUMENT.,And bear the royal virgin far away!
7414,THE ARGUMENT.,"A guest like him, a Trojan guest before,"
7415,THE ARGUMENT.,"In shew of friendship sought the Spartan shore,"
7416,THE ARGUMENT.,And ravish’d Helen from her husband bore.
7417,THE ARGUMENT.,Think on a king’s inviolable word;
7418,THE ARGUMENT.,"And think on Turnus, her once plighted lord:"
7419,THE ARGUMENT.,"To this false foreigner you give your throne,"
7420,THE ARGUMENT.,"And wrong a friend, a kinsman, and a son."
7421,THE ARGUMENT.,"Resume your ancient care; and, if the god"
7422,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your sire, and you, resolve on foreign blood,"
7423,THE ARGUMENT.,"Know all are foreign, in a larger sense,"
7424,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not born your subjects, or deriv’d from hence."
7425,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, if the line of Turnus you retrace,"
7426,THE ARGUMENT.,He springs from Inachus of Argive race.”
7427,THE ARGUMENT.,
7428,THE ARGUMENT.,"But when she saw her reasons idly spent,"
7429,THE ARGUMENT.,"And could not move him from his fix’d intent,"
7430,THE ARGUMENT.,She flew to rage; for now the snake possess’d
7431,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her vital parts, and poison’d all her breast;"
7432,THE ARGUMENT.,"She raves, she runs with a distracted pace,"
7433,THE ARGUMENT.,And fills with horrid howls the public place.
7434,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, as young striplings whip the top for sport,"
7435,THE ARGUMENT.,On the smooth pavement of an empty court;
7436,THE ARGUMENT.,"The wooden engine flies and whirls about,"
7437,THE ARGUMENT.,"Admir’d, with clamours, of the beardless rout;"
7438,THE ARGUMENT.,"They lash aloud; each other they provoke,"
7439,THE ARGUMENT.,And lend their little souls at ev’ry stroke:
7440,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus fares the queen; and thus her fury blows
7441,THE ARGUMENT.,"Amidst the crowd, and kindles as she goes."
7442,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor yet content, she strains her malice more,"
7443,THE ARGUMENT.,And adds new ills to those contriv’d before:
7444,THE ARGUMENT.,"She flies the town, and, mixing with a throng"
7445,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of madding matrons, bears the bride along,"
7446,THE ARGUMENT.,"Wand’ring thro’ woods and wilds, and devious ways,"
7447,THE ARGUMENT.,And with these arts the Trojan match delays.
7448,THE ARGUMENT.,"She feign’d the rites of Bacchus; cried aloud,"
7449,THE ARGUMENT.,And to the buxom god the virgin vow’d.
7450,THE ARGUMENT.,“Evoe! O Bacchus!” thus began the song;
7451,THE ARGUMENT.,And “Evoe!” answer’d all the female throng.
7452,THE ARGUMENT.,“O virgin! worthy thee alone!” she cried;
7453,THE ARGUMENT.,“O worthy thee alone!” the crew replied.
7454,THE ARGUMENT.,"“For thee she feeds her hair, she leads thy dance,"
7455,THE ARGUMENT.,And with thy winding ivy wreathes her lance.”
7456,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like fury seiz’d the rest; the progress known,"
7457,THE ARGUMENT.,"All seek the mountains, and forsake the town:"
7458,THE ARGUMENT.,"All, clad in skins of beasts, the jav’lin bear,"
7459,THE ARGUMENT.,"Give to the wanton winds their flowing hair,"
7460,THE ARGUMENT.,And shrieks and shoutings rend the suff’ring air.
7461,THE ARGUMENT.,"The queen herself, inspir’d with rage divine,"
7462,THE ARGUMENT.,Shook high above her head a flaming pine;
7463,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then roll’d her haggard eyes around the throng,"
7464,THE ARGUMENT.,"And sung, in Turnus’ name, the nuptial song:"
7465,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Io, ye Latian dames! if any here"
7466,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hold your unhappy queen, Amata, dear;"
7467,THE ARGUMENT.,"If there be here,” she said, “who dare maintain"
7468,THE ARGUMENT.,"My right, nor think the name of mother vain;"
7469,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unbind your fillets, loose your flowing hair,"
7470,THE ARGUMENT.,And orgies and nocturnal rites prepare.”
7471,THE ARGUMENT.,
7472,THE ARGUMENT.,"Amata’s breast the Fury thus invades,"
7473,THE ARGUMENT.,"And fires with rage, amid the sylvan shades;"
7474,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, when she found her venom spread so far,"
7475,THE ARGUMENT.,"The royal house embroil’d in civil war,"
7476,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rais’d on her dusky wings, she cleaves the skies,"
7477,THE ARGUMENT.,And seeks the palace where young Turnus lies.
7478,THE ARGUMENT.,"His town, as fame reports, was built of old"
7479,THE ARGUMENT.,"By Danae, pregnant with almighty gold,"
7480,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who fled her father’s rage, and, with a train"
7481,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of following Argives, thro’ the stormy main,"
7482,THE ARGUMENT.,"Driv’n by the southern blasts, was fated here to reign."
7483,THE ARGUMENT.,’Twas Ardua once; now Ardea’s name it bears;
7484,THE ARGUMENT.,"Once a fair city, now consum’d with years."
7485,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here, in his lofty palace, Turnus lay,"
7486,THE ARGUMENT.,"Betwixt the confines of the night and day,"
7487,THE ARGUMENT.,Secure in sleep. The Fury laid aside
7488,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her looks and limbs, and with new methods tried"
7489,THE ARGUMENT.,The foulness of th’ infernal form to hide.
7490,THE ARGUMENT.,"Propp’d on a staff, she takes a trembling mien:"
7491,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her face is furrow’d, and her front obscene;"
7492,THE ARGUMENT.,Deep-dinted wrinkles on her cheek she draws;
7493,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sunk are her eyes, and toothless are her jaws;"
7494,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her hoary hair with holy fillets bound,"
7495,THE ARGUMENT.,Her temples with an olive wreath are crown’d.
7496,THE ARGUMENT.,"Old Chalybe, who kept the sacred fane"
7497,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of Juno, now she seem’d, and thus began,"
7498,THE ARGUMENT.,"Appearing in a dream, to rouse the careless man:"
7499,THE ARGUMENT.,“Shall Turnus then such endless toil sustain
7500,THE ARGUMENT.,"In fighting fields, and conquer towns in vain?"
7501,THE ARGUMENT.,"Win, for a Trojan head to wear the prize,"
7502,THE ARGUMENT.,"Usurp thy crown, enjoy thy victories?"
7503,THE ARGUMENT.,"The bride and scepter which thy blood has bought,"
7504,THE ARGUMENT.,The king transfers; and foreign heirs are sought.
7505,THE ARGUMENT.,"Go now, deluded man, and seek again"
7506,THE ARGUMENT.,"New toils, new dangers, on the dusty plain."
7507,THE ARGUMENT.,Repel the Tuscan foes; their city seize;
7508,THE ARGUMENT.,Protect the Latians in luxurious ease.
7509,THE ARGUMENT.,This dream all-pow’rful Juno sends; I bear
7510,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her mighty mandates, and her words you hear."
7511,THE ARGUMENT.,Haste; arm your Ardeans; issue to the plain;
7512,THE ARGUMENT.,"With fate to friend, assault the Trojan train:"
7513,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their thoughtless chiefs, their painted ships, that lie"
7514,THE ARGUMENT.,"In Tiber’s mouth, with fire and sword destroy."
7515,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Latian king, unless he shall submit,"
7516,THE ARGUMENT.,"Own his old promise, and his new forget;"
7517,THE ARGUMENT.,"Let him, in arms, the pow’r of Turnus prove,"
7518,THE ARGUMENT.,And learn to fear whom he disdains to love.
7519,THE ARGUMENT.,For such is Heav’n’s command.” The youthful prince
7520,THE ARGUMENT.,"With scorn replied, and made this bold defence:"
7521,THE ARGUMENT.,"“You tell me, mother, what I knew before:"
7522,THE ARGUMENT.,The Phrygian fleet is landed on the shore.
7523,THE ARGUMENT.,I neither fear nor will provoke the war;
7524,THE ARGUMENT.,My fate is Juno’s most peculiar care.
7525,THE ARGUMENT.,"But time has made you dote, and vainly tell"
7526,THE ARGUMENT.,Of arms imagin’d in your lonely cell.
7527,THE ARGUMENT.,Go; be the temple and the gods your care;
7528,THE ARGUMENT.,Permit to men the thought of peace and war.”
7529,THE ARGUMENT.,
7530,THE ARGUMENT.,"These haughty words Alecto’s rage provoke,"
7531,THE ARGUMENT.,And frighted Turnus trembled as she spoke.
7532,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her eyes grow stiffen’d, and with sulphur burn;"
7533,THE ARGUMENT.,Her hideous looks and hellish form return;
7534,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her curling snakes with hissings fill the place,"
7535,THE ARGUMENT.,And open all the furies of her face:
7536,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, darting fire from her malignant eyes,"
7537,THE ARGUMENT.,"She cast him backward as he strove to rise,"
7538,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, ling’ring, sought to frame some new replies."
7539,THE ARGUMENT.,"High on her head she rears two twisted snakes,"
7540,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her chains she rattles, and her whip she shakes;"
7541,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, churning bloody foam, thus loudly speaks:"
7542,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Behold whom time has made to dote, and tell"
7543,THE ARGUMENT.,Of arms imagin’d in her lonely cell!
7544,THE ARGUMENT.,Behold the Fates’ infernal minister!
7545,THE ARGUMENT.,"War, death, destruction, in my hand I bear.”"
7546,THE ARGUMENT.,
7547,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus having said, her smould’ring torch, impress’d"
7548,THE ARGUMENT.,"With her full force, she plung’d into his breast."
7549,THE ARGUMENT.,"Aghast he wak’d; and, starting from his bed,"
7550,THE ARGUMENT.,"Cold sweat, in clammy drops, his limbs o’erspread."
7551,THE ARGUMENT.,“Arms! arms!” he cries: “my sword and shield prepare!”
7552,THE ARGUMENT.,"He breathes defiance, blood, and mortal war."
7553,THE ARGUMENT.,"So, when with crackling flames a caldron fries,"
7554,THE ARGUMENT.,The bubbling waters from the bottom rise:
7555,THE ARGUMENT.,Above the brims they force their fiery way;
7556,THE ARGUMENT.,"Black vapours climb aloft, and cloud the day."
7557,THE ARGUMENT.,
7558,THE ARGUMENT.,"The peace polluted thus, a chosen band"
7559,THE ARGUMENT.,"He first commissions to the Latian land,"
7560,THE ARGUMENT.,"In threat’ning embassy; then rais’d the rest,"
7561,THE ARGUMENT.,"To meet in arms th’ intruding Trojan guest,"
7562,THE ARGUMENT.,"To force the foes from the Lavinian shore,"
7563,THE ARGUMENT.,And Italy’s indanger’d peace restore.
7564,THE ARGUMENT.,"Himself alone an equal match he boasts,"
7565,THE ARGUMENT.,To fight the Phrygian and Ausonian hosts.
7566,THE ARGUMENT.,"The gods invok’d, the Rutuli prepare"
7567,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their arms, and warn each other to the war."
7568,THE ARGUMENT.,"His beauty these, and those his blooming age,"
7569,THE ARGUMENT.,The rest his house and his own fame engage.
7570,THE ARGUMENT.,
7571,THE ARGUMENT.,"While Turnus urges thus his enterprise,"
7572,THE ARGUMENT.,The Stygian Fury to the Trojans flies;
7573,THE ARGUMENT.,"New frauds invents, and takes a steepy stand,"
7574,THE ARGUMENT.,Which overlooks the vale with wide command;
7575,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where fair Ascanius and his youthful train,"
7576,THE ARGUMENT.,"With horns and hounds, a hunting match ordain,"
7577,THE ARGUMENT.,And pitch their toils around the shady plain.
7578,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Fury fires the pack; they snuff, they vent,"
7579,THE ARGUMENT.,And feed their hungry nostrils with the scent.
7580,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Twas of a well-grown stag, whose antlers rise"
7581,THE ARGUMENT.,High o’er his front; his beams invade the skies.
7582,THE ARGUMENT.,From this light cause th’ infernal maid prepares
7583,THE ARGUMENT.,"The country churls to mischief, hate, and wars."
7584,THE ARGUMENT.,
7585,THE ARGUMENT.,"The stately beast the two Tyrrhidae bred,"
7586,THE ARGUMENT.,"Snatch’d from his dams, and the tame youngling fed."
7587,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their father Tyrrheus did his fodder bring,"
7588,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tyrrheus, chief ranger to the Latian king:"
7589,THE ARGUMENT.,Their sister Silvia cherish’d with her care
7590,THE ARGUMENT.,"The little wanton, and did wreaths prepare"
7591,THE ARGUMENT.,"To hang his budding horns, with ribbons tied"
7592,THE ARGUMENT.,"His tender neck, and comb’d his silken hide,"
7593,THE ARGUMENT.,And bathed his body. Patient of command
7594,THE ARGUMENT.,"In time he grew, and, growing us’d to hand,"
7595,THE ARGUMENT.,He waited at his master’s board for food;
7596,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then sought his salvage kindred in the wood,"
7597,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where grazing all the day, at night he came"
7598,THE ARGUMENT.,"To his known lodgings, and his country dame."
7599,THE ARGUMENT.,
7600,THE ARGUMENT.,"This household beast, that us’d the woodland grounds,"
7601,THE ARGUMENT.,"Was view’d at first by the young hero’s hounds,"
7602,THE ARGUMENT.,"As down the stream he swam, to seek retreat"
7603,THE ARGUMENT.,"In the cool waters, and to quench his heat."
7604,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ascanius young, and eager of his game,"
7605,THE ARGUMENT.,"Soon bent his bow, uncertain in his aim;"
7606,THE ARGUMENT.,"But the dire fiend the fatal arrow guides,"
7607,THE ARGUMENT.,Which pierc’d his bowels thro’ his panting sides.
7608,THE ARGUMENT.,"The bleeding creature issues from the floods,"
7609,THE ARGUMENT.,"Possess’d with fear, and seeks his known abodes,"
7610,THE ARGUMENT.,His old familiar hearth and household gods.
7611,THE ARGUMENT.,"He falls; he fills the house with heavy groans,"
7612,THE ARGUMENT.,"Implores their pity, and his pain bemoans."

8175,THE ARGUMENT.,Now on the shore the fatal swine is found.
8176,THE ARGUMENT.,Wond’rous to tell!—She lay along the ground:

8192,THE ARGUMENT.,One summer’s night and one whole day they pass
8193,THE ARGUMENT.,"Betwixt the greenwood shades, and cut the liquid glass."

8197,THE ARGUMENT.,"The tops of sheds, and shepherds’ lowly bow’rs,"
8198,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thin as they stood, which, then of homely clay,"
8199,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now rise in marble, from the Roman sway."

8214,THE ARGUMENT.,"A jav’lin seiz’d, and singly took his way;"
8215,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then gain’d a rising ground, and call’d from far:"
8216,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Resolve me, strangers, whence, and what you are;"
8217,THE ARGUMENT.,Your bus’ness here; and bring you peace or war?”
8218,THE ARGUMENT.,"High on the stern Aeneas took his stand,"
8219,THE ARGUMENT.,"And held a branch of olive in his hand,"
8220,THE ARGUMENT.,"While thus he spoke: “The Phrygians’ arms you see,"
8221,THE ARGUMENT.,"Expell’d from Troy, provok’d in Italy"
8222,THE ARGUMENT.,"By Latian foes, with war unjustly made;"
8223,THE ARGUMENT.,"At first affianc’d, and at last betray’d."
8224,THE ARGUMENT.,This message bear: ‘The Trojans and their chief
8225,THE ARGUMENT.,"Bring holy peace, and beg the king’s relief.’"
8226,THE ARGUMENT.,"Struck with so great a name, and all on fire,"
8227,THE ARGUMENT.,"The youth replies: “Whatever you require,"
8228,THE ARGUMENT.,Your fame exacts. Upon our shores descend.
8229,THE ARGUMENT.,"A welcome guest, and, what you wish, a friend.”"
8230,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said, and, downward hasting to the strand,"
8231,THE ARGUMENT.,"Embrac’d the stranger prince, and join’d his hand."
8232,THE ARGUMENT.,
8233,THE ARGUMENT.,"Conducted to the grove, Aeneas broke"
8234,THE ARGUMENT.,"The silence first, and thus the king bespoke:"
8235,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Best of the Greeks, to whom, by fate’s command,"
8236,THE ARGUMENT.,"I bear these peaceful branches in my hand,"
8237,THE ARGUMENT.,"Undaunted I approach you, tho’ I know"
8238,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your birth is Grecian, and your land my foe;"
8239,THE ARGUMENT.,"From Atreus tho’ your ancient lineage came,"
8240,THE ARGUMENT.,And both the brother kings your kindred claim;
8241,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet, my self-conscious worth, your high renown,"
8242,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your virtue, thro’ the neighb’ring nations blown,"
8243,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our fathers’ mingled blood, Apollo’s voice,"
8244,THE ARGUMENT.,"Have led me hither, less by need than choice."
8245,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our founder Dardanus, as fame has sung,"
8246,THE ARGUMENT.,"And Greeks acknowledge, from Electra sprung:"
8247,THE ARGUMENT.,Electra from the loins of Atlas came;
8248,THE ARGUMENT.,"Atlas, whose head sustains the starry frame."
8249,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your sire is Mercury, whom long before"
8250,THE ARGUMENT.,On cold Cyllene’s top fair Maia bore.
8251,THE ARGUMENT.,"Maia the fair, on fame if we rely,"
8252,THE ARGUMENT.,"Was Atlas’ daughter, who sustains the sky."
8253,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus from one common source our streams divide;
8254,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ours is the Trojan, yours th’ Arcadian side."
8255,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rais’d by these hopes, I sent no news before,"
8256,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor ask’d your leave, nor did your faith implore;"
8257,THE ARGUMENT.,"But come, without a pledge, my own ambassador."
8258,THE ARGUMENT.,"The same Rutulians, who with arms pursue"
8259,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojan race, are equal foes to you."
8260,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our host expell’d, what farther force can stay"
8261,THE ARGUMENT.,The victor troops from universal sway?
8262,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then will they stretch their pow’r athwart the land,"
8263,THE ARGUMENT.,And either sea from side to side command.
8264,THE ARGUMENT.,"Receive our offer’d faith, and give us thine;"
8265,THE ARGUMENT.,Ours is a gen’rous and experienc’d line:
8266,THE ARGUMENT.,We want not hearts nor bodies for the war;
8267,THE ARGUMENT.,"In council cautious, and in fields we dare.”"
8268,THE ARGUMENT.,
8269,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said; and while spoke, with piercing eyes"
8270,THE ARGUMENT.,"Evander view’d the man with vast surprise,"
8271,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pleas’d with his action, ravish’d with his face:"
8272,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then answer’d briefly, with a royal grace:"
8273,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O valiant leader of the Trojan line,"
8274,THE ARGUMENT.,"In whom the features of thy father shine,"
8275,THE ARGUMENT.,How I recall Anchises! how I see
8276,THE ARGUMENT.,"His motions, mien, and all my friend, in thee!"
8277,THE ARGUMENT.,"Long tho’ it be, ’tis fresh within my mind,"
8278,THE ARGUMENT.,When Priam to his sister’s court design’d
8279,THE ARGUMENT.,"A welcome visit, with a friendly stay,"
8280,THE ARGUMENT.,And thro’ th’ Arcadian kingdom took his way.
8281,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, past a boy, the callow down began"
8282,THE ARGUMENT.,"To shade my chin, and call me first a man."
8283,THE ARGUMENT.,"I saw the shining train with vast delight,"
8284,THE ARGUMENT.,And Priam’s goodly person pleas’d my sight:
8285,THE ARGUMENT.,"But great Anchises, far above the rest,"
8286,THE ARGUMENT.,With awful wonder fir’d my youthful breast.
8287,THE ARGUMENT.,I long’d to join in friendship’s holy bands
8288,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our mutual hearts, and plight our mutual hands."
8289,THE ARGUMENT.,"I first accosted him: I sued, I sought,"
8290,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, with a loving force, to Pheneus brought."
8291,THE ARGUMENT.,"He gave me, when at length constrain’d to go,"
8292,THE ARGUMENT.,"A Lycian quiver and a Gnossian bow,"
8293,THE ARGUMENT.,"A vest embroider’d, glorious to behold,"
8294,THE ARGUMENT.,"And two rich bridles, with their bits of gold,"
8295,THE ARGUMENT.,Which my son’s coursers in obedience hold.
8296,THE ARGUMENT.,"The league you ask, I offer, as your right;"
8297,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, when tomorrow’s sun reveals the light,"
8298,THE ARGUMENT.,With swift supplies you shall be sent away.
8299,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now celebrate with us this solemn day,"
8300,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose holy rites admit no long delay.
8301,THE ARGUMENT.,"Honour our annual feast; and take your seat,"
8302,THE ARGUMENT.,"With friendly welcome, at a homely treat.”"
8303,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus having said, the bowls remov’d (for fear)"
8304,THE ARGUMENT.,"The youths replac’d, and soon restor’d the cheer."
8305,THE ARGUMENT.,On sods of turf he set the soldiers round:
8306,THE ARGUMENT.,"A maple throne, rais’d higher from the ground,"
8307,THE ARGUMENT.,"Receiv’d the Trojan chief; and, o’er the bed,"
8308,THE ARGUMENT.,A lion’s shaggy hide for ornament they spread.
8309,THE ARGUMENT.,The loaves were serv’d in canisters; the wine
8310,THE ARGUMENT.,In bowls; the priest renew’d the rites divine:
8311,THE ARGUMENT.,"Broil’d entrails are their food, and beef’s continued chine."
8312,THE ARGUMENT.,
8313,THE ARGUMENT.,"But when the rage of hunger was repress’d,"
8314,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus spoke Evander to his royal guest:
8315,THE ARGUMENT.,"“These rites, these altars, and this feast, O king,"
8316,THE ARGUMENT.,"From no vain fears or superstition spring,"
8317,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or blind devotion, or from blinder chance,"
8318,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or heady zeal, or brutal ignorance;"
8319,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, sav’d from danger, with a grateful sense,"
8320,THE ARGUMENT.,The labours of a god we recompense.
8321,THE ARGUMENT.,"See, from afar, yon rock that mates the sky,"
8322,THE ARGUMENT.,About whose feet such heaps of rubbish lie;
8323,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such indigested ruin; bleak and bare,"
8324,THE ARGUMENT.,"How desert now it stands, expos’d in air!"
8325,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Twas once a robber’s den, inclos’d around"
8326,THE ARGUMENT.,"With living stone, and deep beneath the ground."
8327,THE ARGUMENT.,"The monster Cacus, more than half a beast,"
8328,THE ARGUMENT.,"This hold, impervious to the sun, possess’d."
8329,THE ARGUMENT.,The pavement ever foul with human gore;
8330,THE ARGUMENT.,"Heads, and their mangled members, hung the door."
8331,THE ARGUMENT.,"Vulcan this plague begot; and, like his sire,"
8332,THE ARGUMENT.,"Black clouds he belch’d, and flakes of livid fire."
8333,THE ARGUMENT.,"Time, long expected, eas’d us of our load,"
8334,THE ARGUMENT.,And brought the needful presence of a god.
8335,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ avenging force of Hercules, from Spain,"
8336,THE ARGUMENT.,"Arriv’d in triumph, from Geryon slain:"
8337,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thrice liv’d the giant, and thrice liv’d in vain."
8338,THE ARGUMENT.,"His prize, the lowing herds, Alcides drove"
8339,THE ARGUMENT.,"Near Tiber’s bank, to graze the shady grove."
8340,THE ARGUMENT.,"Allur’d with hope of plunder, and intent"
8341,THE ARGUMENT.,"By force to rob, by fraud to circumvent,"
8342,THE ARGUMENT.,"The brutal Cacus, as by chance they stray’d,"
8343,THE ARGUMENT.,"Four oxen thence, and four fair kine convey’d;"
8344,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, lest the printed footsteps might be seen,"
8345,THE ARGUMENT.,He dragg’d ’em backwards to his rocky den.
8346,THE ARGUMENT.,"The tracks averse a lying notice gave,"
8347,THE ARGUMENT.,And led the searcher backward from the cave.
8348,THE ARGUMENT.,
8349,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Meantime the herdsman hero shifts his place,"
8350,THE ARGUMENT.,To find fresh pasture and untrodden grass.
8351,THE ARGUMENT.,"The beasts, who miss’d their mates, fill’d all around"
8352,THE ARGUMENT.,"With bellowings, and the rocks restor’d the sound."
8353,THE ARGUMENT.,"One heifer, who had heard her love complain,"
8354,THE ARGUMENT.,"Roar’d from the cave, and made the project vain."
8355,THE ARGUMENT.,"Alcides found the fraud; with rage he shook,"
8356,THE ARGUMENT.,And toss’d about his head his knotted oak.
8357,THE ARGUMENT.,"Swift as the winds, or Scythian arrows’ flight,"
8358,THE ARGUMENT.,"He clomb, with eager haste, th’ aerial height."
8359,THE ARGUMENT.,Then first we saw the monster mend his pace;
8360,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fear in his eyes, and paleness in his face,"
8361,THE ARGUMENT.,"Confess’d the god’s approach. Trembling he springs,"
8362,THE ARGUMENT.,As terror had increas’d his feet with wings;
8363,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor stay’d for stairs; but down the depth he threw
8364,THE ARGUMENT.,"His body, on his back the door he drew"
8365,THE ARGUMENT.,"(The door, a rib of living rock; with pains"
8366,THE ARGUMENT.,"His father hew’d it out, and bound with iron chains):"
8367,THE ARGUMENT.,"He broke the heavy links, the mountain clos’d,"
8368,THE ARGUMENT.,And bars and levers to his foe oppos’d.
8369,THE ARGUMENT.,The wretch had hardly made his dungeon fast;
8370,THE ARGUMENT.,The fierce avenger came with bounding haste;
8371,THE ARGUMENT.,"Survey’d the mouth of the forbidden hold,"
8372,THE ARGUMENT.,And here and there his raging eyes he roll’d.
8373,THE ARGUMENT.,He gnash’d his teeth; and thrice he compass’d round
8374,THE ARGUMENT.,With winged speed the circuit of the ground.
8375,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thrice at the cavern’s mouth he pull’d in vain,"
8376,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, panting, thrice desisted from his pain."
8377,THE ARGUMENT.,"A pointed flinty rock, all bare and black,"
8378,THE ARGUMENT.,Grew gibbous from behind the mountain’s back;
8379,THE ARGUMENT.,"Owls, ravens, all ill omens of the night,"
8380,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here built their nests, and hither wing’d their flight."
8381,THE ARGUMENT.,"The leaning head hung threat’ning o’er the flood,"
8382,THE ARGUMENT.,And nodded to the left. The hero stood
8383,THE ARGUMENT.,"Adverse, with planted feet, and, from the right,"
8384,THE ARGUMENT.,Tugg’d at the solid stone with all his might.
8385,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus heav’d, the fix’d foundations of the rock"
8386,THE ARGUMENT.,Gave way; heav’n echo’d at the rattling shock.
8387,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tumbling, it chok’d the flood: on either side"
8388,THE ARGUMENT.,"The banks leap backward, and the streams divide;"
8389,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sky shrunk upward with unusual dread,"
8390,THE ARGUMENT.,And trembling Tiber div’d beneath his bed.
8391,THE ARGUMENT.,The court of Cacus stands reveal’d to sight;
8392,THE ARGUMENT.,The cavern glares with new-admitted light.
8393,THE ARGUMENT.,"So the pent vapours, with a rumbling sound,"
8394,THE ARGUMENT.,"Heave from below, and rend the hollow ground;"
8395,THE ARGUMENT.,"A sounding flaw succeeds; and, from on high,"
8396,THE ARGUMENT.,The gods with hate beheld the nether sky:
8397,THE ARGUMENT.,"The ghosts repine at violated night,"
8398,THE ARGUMENT.,"And curse th’ invading sun, and sicken at the sight."
8399,THE ARGUMENT.,"The graceless monster, caught in open day,"
8400,THE ARGUMENT.,"Inclos’d, and in despair to fly away,"
8401,THE ARGUMENT.,"Howls horrible from underneath, and fills"
8402,THE ARGUMENT.,His hollow palace with unmanly yells.
8403,THE ARGUMENT.,"The hero stands above, and from afar"
8404,THE ARGUMENT.,"Plies him with darts, and stones, and distant war."
8405,THE ARGUMENT.,"He, from his nostrils huge mouth, expires"
8406,THE ARGUMENT.,"Black clouds of smoke, amidst his father’s fires,"
8407,THE ARGUMENT.,"Gath’ring, with each repeated blast, the night,"
8408,THE ARGUMENT.,"To make uncertain aim, and erring sight."
8409,THE ARGUMENT.,"The wrathful god then plunges from above,"
8410,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, where in thickest waves the sparkles drove,"
8411,THE ARGUMENT.,"There lights; and wades thro’ fumes, and gropes his way,"
8412,THE ARGUMENT.,"Half sing’d, half stifled, till he grasps his prey."
8413,THE ARGUMENT.,"The monster, spewing fruitless flames, he found;"
8414,THE ARGUMENT.,"He squeez’d his throat; he writh’d his neck around,"
8415,THE ARGUMENT.,And in a knot his crippled members bound;
8416,THE ARGUMENT.,Then from their sockets tore his burning eyes:
8417,THE ARGUMENT.,"Roll’d on a heap, the breathless robber lies."
8418,THE ARGUMENT.,"The doors, unbarr’d, receive the rushing day,"
8419,THE ARGUMENT.,And thoro’ lights disclose the ravish’d prey.
8420,THE ARGUMENT.,"The bulls, redeem’d, breathe open air again."
8421,THE ARGUMENT.,"Next, by the feet, they drag him from his den."
8422,THE ARGUMENT.,"The wond’ring neighbourhood, with glad surprise,"
8423,THE ARGUMENT.,"Behold his shagged breast, his giant size,"
8424,THE ARGUMENT.,"His mouth that flames no more, and his extinguish’d eyes."
8425,THE ARGUMENT.,"From that auspicious day, with rites divine,"
8426,THE ARGUMENT.,We worship at the hero’s holy shrine.
8427,THE ARGUMENT.,Potitius first ordain’d these annual vows:
8428,THE ARGUMENT.,"As priests, were added the Pinarian house,"
8429,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who rais’d this altar in the sacred shade,"
8430,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where honours, ever due, for ever shall be paid."
8431,THE ARGUMENT.,"For these deserts, and this high virtue shown,"
8432,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ye warlike youths, your heads with garlands crown:"
8433,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fill high the goblets with a sparkling flood,"
8434,THE ARGUMENT.,And with deep draughts invoke our common god.”
8435,THE ARGUMENT.,
8436,THE ARGUMENT.,"This said, a double wreath Evander twin’d,"
8437,THE ARGUMENT.,And poplars black and white his temples bind.
8438,THE ARGUMENT.,Then brims his ample bowl. With like design
8439,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rest invoke the gods, with sprinkled wine."
8440,THE ARGUMENT.,"Meantime the sun descended from the skies,"
8441,THE ARGUMENT.,And the bright evening star began to rise.
8442,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now the priests, Potitius at their head,"
8443,THE ARGUMENT.,"In skins of beasts involv’d, the long procession led;"
8444,THE ARGUMENT.,"Held high the flaming tapers in their hands,"
8445,THE ARGUMENT.,As custom had prescrib’d their holy bands;
8446,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then with a second course the tables load,"
8447,THE ARGUMENT.,And with full chargers offer to the god.
8448,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Salii sing, and cense his altars round"
8449,THE ARGUMENT.,"With Saban smoke, their heads with poplar bound"
8450,THE ARGUMENT.,"One choir of old, another of the young,"
8451,THE ARGUMENT.,"To dance, and bear the burthen of the song."
8452,THE ARGUMENT.,"The lay records the labours, and the praise,"
8453,THE ARGUMENT.,And all th’ immortal acts of Hercules:
8454,THE ARGUMENT.,"First, how the mighty babe, when swath’d in bands,"
8455,THE ARGUMENT.,The serpents strangled with his infant hands;
8456,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, as in years and matchless force he grew,"
8457,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ Oechalian walls, and Trojan, overthrew."
8458,THE ARGUMENT.,"Besides, a thousand hazards they relate,"
8459,THE ARGUMENT.,Procur’d by Juno’s and Eurystheus’ hate:
8460,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Thy hands, unconquer’d hero, could subdue"
8461,THE ARGUMENT.,"The cloud-born Centaurs, and the monster crew:"
8462,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor thy resistless arm the bull withstood,"
8463,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor he, the roaring terror of the wood."
8464,THE ARGUMENT.,"The triple porter of the Stygian seat,"
8465,THE ARGUMENT.,"With lolling tongue, lay fawning at thy feet,"
8466,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, seiz’d with fear, forgot his mangled meat."
8467,THE ARGUMENT.,Th’ infernal waters trembled at thy sight;
8468,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thee, god, no face of danger could affright;"
8469,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not huge Typhoeus, nor th’ unnumber’d snake,"
8470,THE ARGUMENT.,"Increas’d with hissing heads, in Lerna’s lake."
8471,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hail, Jove’s undoubted son! an added grace"
8472,THE ARGUMENT.,To heav’n and the great author of thy race!
8473,THE ARGUMENT.,"Receive the grateful off’rings which we pay,"
8474,THE ARGUMENT.,And smile propitious on thy solemn day!”
8475,THE ARGUMENT.,"In numbers thus they sung; above the rest,"
8476,THE ARGUMENT.,The den and death of Cacus crown the feast.
8477,THE ARGUMENT.,"The woods to hollow vales convey the sound,"
8478,THE ARGUMENT.,"The vales to hills, and hills the notes rebound."
8479,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rites perform’d, the cheerful train retire."
8480,THE ARGUMENT.,
8481,THE ARGUMENT.,"Betwixt young Pallas and his aged sire,"
8482,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojan pass’d, the city to survey,"
8483,THE ARGUMENT.,And pleasing talk beguil’d the tedious way.
8484,THE ARGUMENT.,"The stranger cast around his curious eyes,"
8485,THE ARGUMENT.,"New objects viewing still, with new surprise;"
8486,THE ARGUMENT.,"With greedy joy enquires of various things,"
8487,THE ARGUMENT.,And acts and monuments of ancient kings.
8488,THE ARGUMENT.,Then thus the founder of the Roman tow’rs:
8489,THE ARGUMENT.,"“These woods were first the seat of sylvan pow’rs,"
8490,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of Nymphs and Fauns, and salvage men, who took"
8491,THE ARGUMENT.,Their birth from trunks of trees and stubborn oak.
8492,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor laws they knew, nor manners, nor the care"
8493,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of lab’ring oxen, or the shining share,"
8494,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor arts of gain, nor what they gain’d to spare."
8495,THE ARGUMENT.,Their exercise the chase; the running flood
8496,THE ARGUMENT.,"Supplied their thirst, the trees supplied their food."
8497,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Saturn came, who fled the pow’r of Jove,"
8498,THE ARGUMENT.,"Robb’d of his realms, and banish’d from above."
8499,THE ARGUMENT.,"The men, dispers’d on hills, to towns he brought,"
8500,THE ARGUMENT.,"And laws ordain’d, and civil customs taught,"
8501,THE ARGUMENT.,And Latium call’d the land where safe he lay
8502,THE ARGUMENT.,"From his unduteous son, and his usurping sway."
8503,THE ARGUMENT.,"With his mild empire, peace and plenty came;"
8504,THE ARGUMENT.,And hence the golden times deriv’d their name.
8505,THE ARGUMENT.,A more degenerate and discolour’d age
8506,THE ARGUMENT.,"Succeeded this, with avarice and rage."
8507,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ Ausonians then, and bold Sicanians came;"
8508,THE ARGUMENT.,And Saturn’s empire often chang’d the name.
8509,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then kings, gigantic Tybris, and the rest,"
8510,THE ARGUMENT.,With arbitrary sway the land oppress’d:
8511,THE ARGUMENT.,"For Tiber’s flood was Albula before,"
8512,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till, from the tyrant’s fate, his name it bore."
8513,THE ARGUMENT.,"I last arriv’d, driv’n from my native home"
8514,THE ARGUMENT.,"By fortune’s pow’r, and fate’s resistless doom."
8515,THE ARGUMENT.,"Long toss’d on seas, I sought this happy land,"
8516,THE ARGUMENT.,"Warn’d by my mother nymph, and call’d by Heav’n’s command.”"
8517,THE ARGUMENT.,
8518,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus, walking on, he spoke, and shew’d the gate,"
8519,THE ARGUMENT.,Since call’d Carmental by the Roman state;
8520,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where stood an altar, sacred to the name"
8521,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of old Carmenta, the prophetic dame,"
8522,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who to her son foretold th’ Aenean race,"
8523,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sublime in fame, and Rome’s imperial place:"
8524,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then shews the forest, which, in after times,"
8525,THE ARGUMENT.,Fierce Romulus for perpetrated crimes
8526,THE ARGUMENT.,"A sacred refuge made; with this, the shrine"
8527,THE ARGUMENT.,Where Pan below the rock had rites divine:
8528,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then tells of Argus’ death, his murder’d guest,"
8529,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose grave and tomb his innocence attest.
8530,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thence, to the steep Tarpeian rock he leads;"
8531,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now roof’d with gold, then thatch’d with homely reeds."
8532,THE ARGUMENT.,A reverent fear (such superstition reigns
8533,THE ARGUMENT.,Among the rude) ev’n then possess’d the swains.
8534,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some god, they knew—what god, they could not tell—"
8535,THE ARGUMENT.,Did there amidst the sacred horror dwell.
8536,THE ARGUMENT.,Th’ Arcadians thought him Jove; and said they saw
8537,THE ARGUMENT.,"The mighty Thund’rer with majestic awe,"
8538,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who took his shield, and dealt his bolts around,"
8539,THE ARGUMENT.,And scatter’d tempests on the teeming ground.
8540,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then saw two heaps of ruins, (once they stood"
8541,THE ARGUMENT.,"Two stately towns, on either side the flood,)"
8542,THE ARGUMENT.,Saturnia’s and Janiculum’s remains;
8543,THE ARGUMENT.,And either place the founder’s name retains.
8544,THE ARGUMENT.,"Discoursing thus together, they resort"
8545,THE ARGUMENT.,Where poor Evander kept his country court.
8546,THE ARGUMENT.,They view’d the ground of Rome’s litigious hall;
8547,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Once oxen low’d, where now the lawyers bawl;)"
8548,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, stooping, thro’ the narrow gate they press’d,"
8549,THE ARGUMENT.,When thus the king bespoke his Trojan guest:
8550,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Mean as it is, this palace, and this door,"
8551,THE ARGUMENT.,"Receiv’d Alcides, then a conqueror."
8552,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dare to be poor; accept our homely food,"
8553,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which feasted him, and emulate a god.”"
8554,THE ARGUMENT.,Then underneath a lowly roof he led
8555,THE ARGUMENT.,"The weary prince, and laid him on a bed;"
8556,THE ARGUMENT.,"The stuffing leaves, with hides of bears o’erspread."
8557,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now night had shed her silver dews around,"
8558,THE ARGUMENT.,"And with her sable wings embrac’d the ground,"
8559,THE ARGUMENT.,"When love’s fair goddess, anxious for her son,"
8560,THE ARGUMENT.,"(New tumults rising, and new wars begun,)"
8561,THE ARGUMENT.,"Couch’d with her husband in his golden bed,"
8562,THE ARGUMENT.,With these alluring words invokes his aid;
8563,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, that her pleasing speech his mind may move,"
8564,THE ARGUMENT.,Inspires each accent with the charms of love:
8565,THE ARGUMENT.,"“While cruel fate conspir’d with Grecian pow’rs,"
8566,THE ARGUMENT.,"To level with the ground the Trojan tow’rs,"
8567,THE ARGUMENT.,"I ask’d not aid th’ unhappy to restore,"
8568,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor did the succour of thy skill implore;
8569,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor urg’d the labours of my lord in vain,"
8570,THE ARGUMENT.,"A sinking empire longer to sustain,"
8571,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tho’ much I ow’d to Priam’s house, and more"
8572,THE ARGUMENT.,The dangers of Aeneas did deplore.
8573,THE ARGUMENT.,"But now, by Jove’s command, and fate’s decree,"
8574,THE ARGUMENT.,His race is doom’d to reign in Italy:
8575,THE ARGUMENT.,"With humble suit I beg thy needful art,"
8576,THE ARGUMENT.,"O still propitious pow’r, that rules my heart!"
8577,THE ARGUMENT.,A mother kneels a suppliant for her son.
8578,THE ARGUMENT.,By Thetis and Aurora thou wert won
8579,THE ARGUMENT.,"To forge impenetrable shields, and grace"
8580,THE ARGUMENT.,With fated arms a less illustrious race.
8581,THE ARGUMENT.,"Behold, what haughty nations are combin’d"
8582,THE ARGUMENT.,"Against the relics of the Phrygian kind,"
8583,THE ARGUMENT.,"With fire and sword my people to destroy,"
8584,THE ARGUMENT.,"And conquer Venus twice, in conqu’ring Troy.”"
8585,THE ARGUMENT.,"She said; and straight her arms, of snowy hue,"
8586,THE ARGUMENT.,About her unresolving husband threw.
8587,THE ARGUMENT.,Her soft embraces soon infuse desire;
8588,THE ARGUMENT.,His bones and marrow sudden warmth inspire;
8589,THE ARGUMENT.,And all the godhead feels the wonted fire.
8590,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not half so swift the rattling thunder flies,"
8591,THE ARGUMENT.,Or forky lightnings flash along the skies.
8592,THE ARGUMENT.,"The goddess, proud of her successful wiles,"
8593,THE ARGUMENT.,"And conscious of her form, in secret smiles."
8594,THE ARGUMENT.,
8595,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then thus the pow’r, obnoxious to her charms,"
8596,THE ARGUMENT.,"Panting, and half dissolving in her arms:"
8597,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Why seek you reasons for a cause so just,"
8598,THE ARGUMENT.,Or your own beauties or my love distrust?
8599,THE ARGUMENT.,"Long since, had you requir’d my helpful hand,"
8600,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ artificer and art you might command,"
8601,THE ARGUMENT.,"To labour arms for Troy: nor Jove, nor fate,"
8602,THE ARGUMENT.,Confin’d their empire to so short a date.
8603,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, if you now desire new wars to wage,"
8604,THE ARGUMENT.,"My skill I promise, and my pains engage."
8605,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whatever melting metals can conspire,"
8606,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or breathing bellows, or the forming fire,"
8607,THE ARGUMENT.,"Is freely yours: your anxious fears remove,"
8608,THE ARGUMENT.,And think no task is difficult to love.”
8609,THE ARGUMENT.,"Trembling he spoke; and, eager of her charms,"
8610,THE ARGUMENT.,He snatch’d the willing goddess to his arms;
8611,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till in her lap infus’d, he lay possess’d"
8612,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of full desire, and sunk to pleasing rest."
8613,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now when the night her middle race had rode,"
8614,THE ARGUMENT.,And his first slumber had refresh’d the god—
8615,THE ARGUMENT.,The time when early housewives leave the bed;
8616,THE ARGUMENT.,"When living embers on the hearth they spread,"
8617,THE ARGUMENT.,"Supply the lamp, and call the maids to rise;—"
8618,THE ARGUMENT.,"With yawning mouths, and with half-open’d eyes,"
8619,THE ARGUMENT.,"They ply the distaff by the winking light,"
8620,THE ARGUMENT.,And to their daily labour add the night:
8621,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus frugally they earn their children’s bread,"
8622,THE ARGUMENT.,And uncorrupted keep the nuptial bed—
8623,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not less concern’d, nor at a later hour,"
8624,THE ARGUMENT.,Rose from his downy couch the forging pow’r.
8625,THE ARGUMENT.,
8626,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sacred to Vulcan’s name, an isle there lay,"
8627,THE ARGUMENT.,"Betwixt Sicilia’s coasts and Lipare,"
8628,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rais’d high on smoking rocks; and, deep below,"
8629,THE ARGUMENT.,In hollow caves the fires of Aetna glow.
8630,THE ARGUMENT.,The Cyclops here their heavy hammers deal;
8631,THE ARGUMENT.,"Loud strokes, and hissings of tormented steel,"
8632,THE ARGUMENT.,"Are heard around; the boiling waters roar,"
8633,THE ARGUMENT.,And smoky flames thro’ fuming tunnels soar.
8634,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hither the Father of the Fire, by night,"
8635,THE ARGUMENT.,Thro’ the brown air precipitates his flight.
8636,THE ARGUMENT.,On their eternal anvils here he found
8637,THE ARGUMENT.,"The brethren beating, and the blows go round."
8638,THE ARGUMENT.,A load of pointless thunder now there lies
8639,THE ARGUMENT.,"Before their hands, to ripen for the skies:"
8640,THE ARGUMENT.,"These darts, for angry Jove, they daily cast;"
8641,THE ARGUMENT.,Consum’d on mortals with prodigious waste.
8642,THE ARGUMENT.,"Three rays of writhen rain, of fire three more,"
8643,THE ARGUMENT.,Of winged southern winds and cloudy store
8644,THE ARGUMENT.,"As many parts, the dreadful mixture frame;"
8645,THE ARGUMENT.,"And fears are added, and avenging flame."
8646,THE ARGUMENT.,"Inferior ministers, for Mars, repair"
8647,THE ARGUMENT.,"His broken axletrees and blunted war,"
8648,THE ARGUMENT.,"And send him forth again with furbish’d arms,"
8649,THE ARGUMENT.,To wake the lazy war with trumpets’ loud alarms.
8650,THE ARGUMENT.,The rest refresh the scaly snakes that fold
8651,THE ARGUMENT.,"The shield of Pallas, and renew their gold."
8652,THE ARGUMENT.,"Full on the crest the Gorgon’s head they place,"
8653,THE ARGUMENT.,"With eyes that roll in death, and with distorted face."
8654,THE ARGUMENT.,
8655,THE ARGUMENT.,"“My sons,” said Vulcan, “set your tasks aside;"
8656,THE ARGUMENT.,Your strength and master-skill must now be tried.
8657,THE ARGUMENT.,Arms for a hero forge; arms that require
8658,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your force, your speed, and all your forming fire.”"
8659,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said. They set their former work aside,"
8660,THE ARGUMENT.,And their new toils with eager haste divide.
8661,THE ARGUMENT.,"A flood of molten silver, brass, and gold,"
8662,THE ARGUMENT.,"And deadly steel, in the large furnace roll’d;"
8663,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of this, their artful hands a shield prepare,"
8664,THE ARGUMENT.,Alone sufficient to sustain the war.
8665,THE ARGUMENT.,Sev’n orbs within a spacious round they close:
8666,THE ARGUMENT.,"One stirs the fire, and one the bellows blows."
8667,THE ARGUMENT.,The hissing steel is in the smithy drown’d;
8668,THE ARGUMENT.,The grot with beaten anvils groans around.
8669,THE ARGUMENT.,"By turns their arms advance, in equal time;"
8670,THE ARGUMENT.,"By turns their hands descend, and hammers chime."
8671,THE ARGUMENT.,They turn the glowing mass with crooked tongs;
8672,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fiery work proceeds, with rustic songs."
8673,THE ARGUMENT.,
8674,THE ARGUMENT.,"While, at the Lemnian god’s command, they urge"
8675,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their labours thus, and ply th’ Aeolian forge,"
8676,THE ARGUMENT.,"The cheerful morn salutes Evander’s eyes,"
8677,THE ARGUMENT.,And songs of chirping birds invite to rise.
8678,THE ARGUMENT.,He leaves his lowly bed: his buskins meet
8679,THE ARGUMENT.,Above his ankles; sandals sheathe his feet:
8680,THE ARGUMENT.,"He sets his trusty sword upon his side,"
8681,THE ARGUMENT.,And o’er his shoulder throws a panther’s hide.
8682,THE ARGUMENT.,Two menial dogs before their master press’d.
8683,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus clad, and guarded thus, he seeks his kingly guest."
8684,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mindful of promis’d aid, he mends his pace,"
8685,THE ARGUMENT.,But meets Aeneas in the middle space.
8686,THE ARGUMENT.,"Young Pallas did his father’s steps attend,"
8687,THE ARGUMENT.,And true Achates waited on his friend.
8688,THE ARGUMENT.,They join their hands; a secret seat they choose;
8689,THE ARGUMENT.,Th’ Arcadian first their former talk renews:
8690,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Undaunted prince, I never can believe"
8691,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojan empire lost, while you survive."
8692,THE ARGUMENT.,Command th’ assistance of a faithful friend;
8693,THE ARGUMENT.,But feeble are the succours I can send.
8694,THE ARGUMENT.,Our narrow kingdom here the Tiber bounds;
8695,THE ARGUMENT.,"That other side the Latian state surrounds,"
8696,THE ARGUMENT.,"Insults our walls, and wastes our fruitful grounds."
8697,THE ARGUMENT.,"But mighty nations I prepare, to join"
8698,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their arms with yours, and aid your just design."
8699,THE ARGUMENT.,"You come, as by your better genius sent,"
8700,THE ARGUMENT.,And fortune seems to favour your intent.
8701,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not far from hence there stands a hilly town,"
8702,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of ancient building, and of high renown,"
8703,THE ARGUMENT.,"Torn from the Tuscans by the Lydian race,"
8704,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who gave the name of Caere to the place,"
8705,THE ARGUMENT.,"Once Agyllina call’d. It flourish’d long,"
8706,THE ARGUMENT.,"In pride of wealth and warlike people strong,"
8707,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till curs’d Mezentius, in a fatal hour,"
8708,THE ARGUMENT.,"Assum’d the crown, with arbitrary pow’r."
8709,THE ARGUMENT.,"What words can paint those execrable times,"
8710,THE ARGUMENT.,"The subjects’ suff’rings, and the tyrant’s crimes!"
8711,THE ARGUMENT.,"That blood, those murders, O ye gods, replace"
8712,THE ARGUMENT.,"On his own head, and on his impious race!"
8713,THE ARGUMENT.,The living and the dead at his command
8714,THE ARGUMENT.,"Were coupled, face to face, and hand to hand,"
8715,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till, chok’d with stench, in loath’d embraces tied,"
8716,THE ARGUMENT.,The ling’ring wretches pin’d away and died.
8717,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus plung’d in ills, and meditating more—"
8718,THE ARGUMENT.,"The people’s patience, tir’d, no longer bore"
8719,THE ARGUMENT.,The raging monster; but with arms beset
8720,THE ARGUMENT.,"His house, and vengeance and destruction threat."
8721,THE ARGUMENT.,"They fire his palace: while the flame ascends,"
8722,THE ARGUMENT.,"They force his guards, and execute his friends."
8723,THE ARGUMENT.,"He cleaves the crowd, and, favour’d by the night,"
8724,THE ARGUMENT.,To Turnus’ friendly court directs his flight.
8725,THE ARGUMENT.,"By just revenge the Tuscans set on fire,"
8726,THE ARGUMENT.,"With arms, their king to punishment require:"
8727,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their num’rous troops, now muster’d on the strand,"
8728,THE ARGUMENT.,My counsel shall submit to your command.
8729,THE ARGUMENT.,Their navy swarms upon the coasts; they cry
8730,THE ARGUMENT.,"To hoist their anchors, but the gods deny."
8731,THE ARGUMENT.,"An ancient augur, skill’d in future fate,"
8732,THE ARGUMENT.,With these foreboding words restrains their hate:
8733,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘Ye brave in arms, ye Lydian blood, the flow’r"
8734,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of Tuscan youth, and choice of all their pow’r,"
8735,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whom just revenge against Mezentius arms,"
8736,THE ARGUMENT.,To seek your tyrant’s death by lawful arms;
8737,THE ARGUMENT.,Know this: no native of our land may lead
8738,THE ARGUMENT.,This pow’rful people; seek a foreign head.’
8739,THE ARGUMENT.,"Aw’d with these words, in camps they still abide,"
8740,THE ARGUMENT.,And wait with longing looks their promis’d guide.
8741,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tarchon, the Tuscan chief, to me has sent"

9123,THE ARGUMENT.,Arm! arm! and man the works! prepare your spears
9124,THE ARGUMENT.,And pointed darts! the Latian host appears.”
9125,THE ARGUMENT.,
9126,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus warn’d, they shut their gates; with shouts ascend"
9127,THE ARGUMENT.,"The bulwarks, and, secure, their foes attend:"
9128,THE ARGUMENT.,"For their wise gen’ral, with foreseeing care,"
9129,THE ARGUMENT.,"Had charg’d them not to tempt the doubtful war,"
9130,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor, tho’ provok’d, in open fields advance,"
9131,THE ARGUMENT.,But close within their lines attend their chance.
9132,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unwilling, yet they keep the strict command,"
9133,THE ARGUMENT.,And sourly wait in arms the hostile band.
9134,THE ARGUMENT.,The fiery Turnus flew before the rest:
9135,THE ARGUMENT.,A piebald steed of Thracian strain he press’d;
9136,THE ARGUMENT.,"His helm of massy gold, and crimson was his crest."
9137,THE ARGUMENT.,"With twenty horse to second his designs,"
9138,THE ARGUMENT.,"An unexpected foe, he fac’d the lines."
9139,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Is there,” he said, “in arms, who bravely dare"
9140,THE ARGUMENT.,His leader’s honour and his danger share?”
9141,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then spurring on, his brandish’d dart he threw,"
9142,THE ARGUMENT.,In sign of war: applauding shouts ensue.
9143,THE ARGUMENT.,
9144,THE ARGUMENT.,"Amaz’d to find a dastard race, that run"
9145,THE ARGUMENT.,"Behind the rampires and the battle shun,"
9146,THE ARGUMENT.,"He rides around the camp, with rolling eyes,"
9147,THE ARGUMENT.,"And stops at ev’ry post, and ev’ry passage tries."
9148,THE ARGUMENT.,So roams the nightly wolf about the fold:
9149,THE ARGUMENT.,"Wet with descending show’rs, and stiff with cold,"
9150,THE ARGUMENT.,"He howls for hunger, and he grins for pain,"
9151,THE ARGUMENT.,"(His gnashing teeth are exercis’d in vain,)"
9152,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, impotent of anger, finds no way"
9153,THE ARGUMENT.,In his distended paws to grasp the prey.
9154,THE ARGUMENT.,The mothers listen; but the bleating lambs
9155,THE ARGUMENT.,"Securely swig the dug, beneath the dams."
9156,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus ranges eager Turnus o’er the plain.
9157,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sharp with desire, and furious with disdain;"
9158,THE ARGUMENT.,"Surveys each passage with a piercing sight,"
9159,THE ARGUMENT.,To force his foes in equal field to fight.
9160,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus while he gazes round, at length he spies,"
9161,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where, fenc’d with strong redoubts, their navy lies,"
9162,THE ARGUMENT.,Close underneath the walls; the washing tide
9163,THE ARGUMENT.,Secures from all approach this weaker side.
9164,THE ARGUMENT.,"He takes the wish’d occasion, fills his hand"
9165,THE ARGUMENT.,"With ready fires, and shakes a flaming brand."
9166,THE ARGUMENT.,"Urg’d by his presence, ev’ry soul is warm’d,"
9167,THE ARGUMENT.,And ev’ry hand with kindled fires is arm’d.
9168,THE ARGUMENT.,From the fir’d pines the scatt’ring sparkles fly;
9169,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fat vapours, mix’d with flames, involve the sky."
9170,THE ARGUMENT.,"What pow’r, O Muses, could avert the flame"
9171,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which threaten’d, in the fleet, the Trojan name?"
9172,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tell: for the fact, thro’ length of time obscure,"
9173,THE ARGUMENT.,Is hard to faith; yet shall the fame endure.
9174,THE ARGUMENT.,
9175,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Tis said that, when the chief prepar’d his flight,"
9176,THE ARGUMENT.,"And fell’d his timber from Mount Ida’s height,"
9177,THE ARGUMENT.,"The grandam goddess then approach’d her son,"
9178,THE ARGUMENT.,And with a mother’s majesty begun:
9179,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Grant me,” she said, “the sole request I bring,"
9180,THE ARGUMENT.,Since conquer’d heav’n has own’d you for its king.
9181,THE ARGUMENT.,"On Ida’s brows, for ages past, there stood,"
9182,THE ARGUMENT.,"With firs and maples fill’d, a shady wood;"
9183,THE ARGUMENT.,"And on the summit rose a sacred grove,"
9184,THE ARGUMENT.,Where I was worship’d with religious love.
9185,THE ARGUMENT.,"Those woods, that holy grove, my long delight,"
9186,THE ARGUMENT.,"I gave the Trojan prince, to speed his flight."
9187,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, fill’d with fear, on their behalf I come;"
9188,THE ARGUMENT.,"Let neither winds o’erset, nor waves intomb"
9189,THE ARGUMENT.,The floating forests of the sacred pine;
9190,THE ARGUMENT.,But let it be their safety to be mine.”
9191,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then thus replied her awful son, who rolls"
9192,THE ARGUMENT.,"The radiant stars, and heav’n and earth controls:"
9193,THE ARGUMENT.,"“How dare you, mother, endless date demand"
9194,THE ARGUMENT.,For vessels moulded by a mortal hand?
9195,THE ARGUMENT.,"What then is fate? Shall bold Aeneas ride,"
9196,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of safety certain, on th’ uncertain tide?"
9197,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet, what I can, I grant; when, wafted o’er,"
9198,THE ARGUMENT.,"The chief is landed on the Latian shore,"
9199,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whatever ships escape the raging storms,"
9200,THE ARGUMENT.,At my command shall change their fading forms
9201,THE ARGUMENT.,"To nymphs divine, and plow the wat’ry way,"
9202,THE ARGUMENT.,Like Dotis and the daughters of the sea.”
9203,THE ARGUMENT.,"To seal his sacred vow, by Styx he swore,"
9204,THE ARGUMENT.,"The lake of liquid pitch, the dreary shore,"
9205,THE ARGUMENT.,"And Phlegethon’s innavigable flood,"
9206,THE ARGUMENT.,And the black regions of his brother god.
9207,THE ARGUMENT.,He said; and shook the skies with his imperial nod.
9208,THE ARGUMENT.,
9209,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now at length the number’d hours were come,"
9210,THE ARGUMENT.,"Prefix’d by fate’s irrevocable doom,"
9211,THE ARGUMENT.,When the great Mother of the Gods was free
9212,THE ARGUMENT.,"To save her ships, and finish Jove’s decree."
9213,THE ARGUMENT.,"First, from the quarter of the morn, there sprung"
9214,THE ARGUMENT.,"A light that sign’d the heav’ns, and shot along;"
9215,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then from a cloud, fring’d round with golden fires,"
9216,THE ARGUMENT.,"Were timbrels heard, and Berecynthian choirs;"
9217,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, last, a voice, with more than mortal sounds,"
9218,THE ARGUMENT.,"Both hosts, in arms oppos’d, with equal horror wounds:"
9219,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O Trojan race, your needless aid forbear,"
9220,THE ARGUMENT.,"And know, my ships are my peculiar care."
9221,THE ARGUMENT.,"With greater ease the bold Rutulian may,"
9222,THE ARGUMENT.,"With hissing brands, attempt to burn the sea,"
9223,THE ARGUMENT.,"Than singe my sacred pines. But you, my charge,"
9224,THE ARGUMENT.,"Loos’d from your crooked anchors, launch at large,"
9225,THE ARGUMENT.,"Exalted each a nymph: forsake the sand,"
9226,THE ARGUMENT.,"And swim the seas, at Cybele’s command.”"
9227,THE ARGUMENT.,"No sooner had the goddess ceas’d to speak,"
9228,THE ARGUMENT.,"When, lo! th’ obedient ships their haulsers break;"
9229,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, strange to tell, like dolphins, in the main"
9230,THE ARGUMENT.,"They plunge their prows, and dive, and spring again:"
9231,THE ARGUMENT.,"As many beauteous maids the billows sweep,"
9232,THE ARGUMENT.,As rode before tall vessels on the deep.
9233,THE ARGUMENT.,
9234,THE ARGUMENT.,"The foes, surpris’d with wonder, stood aghast;"
9235,THE ARGUMENT.,Messapus curb’d his fiery courser’s haste;
9236,THE ARGUMENT.,"Old Tiber roar’d, and, raising up his head,"
9237,THE ARGUMENT.,Call’d back his waters to their oozy bed.
9238,THE ARGUMENT.,"Turnus alone, undaunted, bore the shock,"
9239,THE ARGUMENT.,And with these words his trembling troops bespoke:
9240,THE ARGUMENT.,"“These monsters for the Trojans’ fate are meant,"
9241,THE ARGUMENT.,And are by Jove for black presages sent.
9242,THE ARGUMENT.,He takes the cowards’ last relief away;
9243,THE ARGUMENT.,"For fly they cannot, and, constrain’d to stay,"
9244,THE ARGUMENT.,"Must yield unfought, a base inglorious prey."
9245,THE ARGUMENT.,The liquid half of all the globe is lost;
9246,THE ARGUMENT.,"Heav’n shuts the seas, and we secure the coast."
9247,THE ARGUMENT.,Theirs is no more than that small spot of ground
9248,THE ARGUMENT.,Which myriads of our martial men surround.
9249,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their fates I fear not, or vain oracles."
9250,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Twas giv’n to Venus they should cross the seas,"
9251,THE ARGUMENT.,And land secure upon the Latian plains:
9252,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their promis’d hour is pass’d, and mine remains."
9253,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Tis in the fate of Turnus to destroy,"
9254,THE ARGUMENT.,"With sword and fire, the faithless race of Troy."
9255,THE ARGUMENT.,Shall such affronts as these alone inflame
9256,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Grecian brothers, and the Grecian name?"
9257,THE ARGUMENT.,"My cause and theirs is one; a fatal strife,"
9258,THE ARGUMENT.,"And final ruin, for a ravish’d wife."
9259,THE ARGUMENT.,"Was ’t not enough, that, punish’d for the crime,"
9260,THE ARGUMENT.,They fell; but will they fall a second time?
9261,THE ARGUMENT.,"One would have thought they paid enough before,"
9262,THE ARGUMENT.,"To curse the costly sex, and durst offend no more."
9263,THE ARGUMENT.,"Can they securely trust their feeble wall,"
9264,THE ARGUMENT.,"A slight partition, a thin interval,"
9265,THE ARGUMENT.,"Betwixt their fate and them; when Troy, tho’ built"
9266,THE ARGUMENT.,"By hands divine, yet perish’d by their guilt?"
9267,THE ARGUMENT.,"Lend me, for once, my friends, your valiant hands,"
9268,THE ARGUMENT.,To force from out their lines these dastard bands.
9269,THE ARGUMENT.,"Less than a thousand ships will end this war,"
9270,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor Vulcan needs his fated arms prepare.
9271,THE ARGUMENT.,"Let all the Tuscans, all th’ Arcadians, join!"
9272,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor these, nor those, shall frustrate my design."
9273,THE ARGUMENT.,"Let them not fear the treasons of the night,"
9274,THE ARGUMENT.,"The robb’d Palladium, the pretended flight:"
9275,THE ARGUMENT.,Our onset shall be made in open light.
9276,THE ARGUMENT.,No wooden engine shall their town betray;
9277,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fires they shall have around, but fires by day."
9278,THE ARGUMENT.,"No Grecian babes before their camp appear,"
9279,THE ARGUMENT.,Whom Hector’s arms detain’d to the tenth tardy year.
9280,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, since the sun is rolling to the west,"
9281,THE ARGUMENT.,Give we the silent night to needful rest:
9282,THE ARGUMENT.,"Refresh your bodies, and your arms prepare;"
9283,THE ARGUMENT.,The morn shall end the small remains of war.”
9284,THE ARGUMENT.,
9285,THE ARGUMENT.,"The post of honour to Messapus falls,"
9286,THE ARGUMENT.,"To keep the nightly guard, to watch the walls,"
9287,THE ARGUMENT.,"To pitch the fires at distances around,"
9288,THE ARGUMENT.,And close the Trojans in their scanty ground.
9289,THE ARGUMENT.,"Twice seven Rutulian captains ready stand,"
9290,THE ARGUMENT.,And twice seven hundred horse these chiefs command;
9291,THE ARGUMENT.,"All clad in shining arms the works invest,"
9292,THE ARGUMENT.,Each with a radiant helm and waving crest.
9293,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stretch’d at their length, they press the grassy ground;"
9294,THE ARGUMENT.,"They laugh, they sing, (the jolly bowls go round,)"
9295,THE ARGUMENT.,"With lights and cheerful fires renew the day,"
9296,THE ARGUMENT.,And pass the wakeful night in feasts and play.
9297,THE ARGUMENT.,
9298,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojans, from above, their foes beheld,"
9299,THE ARGUMENT.,And with arm’d legions all the rampires fill’d.
9300,THE ARGUMENT.,"Seiz’d with affright, their gates they first explore;"
9301,THE ARGUMENT.,"Join works to works with bridges, tow’r to tow’r:"
9302,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus all things needful for defence abound.
9303,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mnestheus and brave Seresthus walk the round,"
9304,THE ARGUMENT.,Commission’d by their absent prince to share
9305,THE ARGUMENT.,"The common danger, and divide the care."
9306,THE ARGUMENT.,"The soldiers draw their lots, and, as they fall,"
9307,THE ARGUMENT.,By turns relieve each other on the wall.
9308,THE ARGUMENT.,
9309,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nigh where the foes their utmost guards advance,"
9310,THE ARGUMENT.,To watch the gate was warlike Nisus’ chance.
9311,THE ARGUMENT.,His father Hyrtacus of noble blood;
9312,THE ARGUMENT.,"His mother was a huntress of the wood,"
9313,THE ARGUMENT.,And sent him to the wars. Well could he bear
9314,THE ARGUMENT.,"His lance in fight, and dart the flying spear,"
9315,THE ARGUMENT.,But better skill’d unerring shafts to send.
9316,THE ARGUMENT.,"Beside him stood Euryalus, his friend:"
9317,THE ARGUMENT.,"Euryalus, than whom the Trojan host"
9318,THE ARGUMENT.,"No fairer face, or sweeter air, could boast."
9319,THE ARGUMENT.,Scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun.
9320,THE ARGUMENT.,"One was their care, and their delight was one:"
9321,THE ARGUMENT.,"One common hazard in the war they shar’d,"
9322,THE ARGUMENT.,And now were both by choice upon the guard.
9323,THE ARGUMENT.,
9324,THE ARGUMENT.,Then Nisus thus: “Or do the gods inspire
9325,THE ARGUMENT.,"This warmth, or make we gods of our desire?"
9326,THE ARGUMENT.,"A gen’rous ardour boils within my breast,"
9327,THE ARGUMENT.,"Eager of action, enemy to rest:"
9328,THE ARGUMENT.,"This urges me to fight, and fires my mind"
9329,THE ARGUMENT.,To leave a memorable name behind.
9330,THE ARGUMENT.,Thou see’st the foe secure; how faintly shine
9331,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their scatter’d fires! the most, in sleep supine"
9332,THE ARGUMENT.,"Along the ground, an easy conquest lie:"
9333,THE ARGUMENT.,The wakeful few the fuming flagon ply;
9334,THE ARGUMENT.,All hush’d around. Now hear what I revolve—
9335,THE ARGUMENT.,A thought unripe—and scarcely yet resolve.
9336,THE ARGUMENT.,Our absent prince both camp and council mourn;
9337,THE ARGUMENT.,By message both would hasten his return:
9338,THE ARGUMENT.,"If they confer what I demand on thee,"
9339,THE ARGUMENT.,"(For fame is recompense enough for me,)"
9340,THE ARGUMENT.,"Methinks, beneath yon hill, I have espied"
9341,THE ARGUMENT.,A way that safely will my passage guide.”
9342,THE ARGUMENT.,
9343,THE ARGUMENT.,"Euryalus stood list’ning while he spoke,"
9344,THE ARGUMENT.,With love of praise and noble envy struck;
9345,THE ARGUMENT.,Then to his ardent friend expos’d his mind:
9346,THE ARGUMENT.,"“All this, alone, and leaving me behind!"
9347,THE ARGUMENT.,"Am I unworthy, Nisus, to be join’d?"
9348,THE ARGUMENT.,"Think’st thou I can my share of glory yield,"
9349,THE ARGUMENT.,Or send thee unassisted to the field?
9350,THE ARGUMENT.,Not so my father taught my childhood arms;
9351,THE ARGUMENT.,"Born in a siege, and bred among alarms!"
9352,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor is my youth unworthy of my friend,"
9353,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor of the heav’n-born hero I attend.
9354,THE ARGUMENT.,"The thing call’d life, with ease I can disclaim,"
9355,THE ARGUMENT.,And think it over-sold to purchase fame.”
9356,THE ARGUMENT.,
9357,THE ARGUMENT.,Then Nisus thus: “Alas! thy tender years
9358,THE ARGUMENT.,Would minister new matter to my fears.
9359,THE ARGUMENT.,"So may the gods, who view this friendly strife,"
9360,THE ARGUMENT.,"Restore me to thy lov’d embrace with life,"
9361,THE ARGUMENT.,"Condemn’d to pay my vows, (as sure I trust,)"
9362,THE ARGUMENT.,This thy request is cruel and unjust.
9363,THE ARGUMENT.,"But if some chance—as many chances are,"
9364,THE ARGUMENT.,"And doubtful hazards, in the deeds of war—"
9365,THE ARGUMENT.,"If one should reach my head, there let it fall,"
9366,THE ARGUMENT.,And spare thy life; I would not perish all.
9367,THE ARGUMENT.,Thy bloomy youth deserves a longer date:
9368,THE ARGUMENT.,Live thou to mourn thy love’s unhappy fate;
9369,THE ARGUMENT.,"To bear my mangled body from the foe,"
9370,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or buy it back, and fun’ral rites bestow."
9371,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or, if hard fortune shall those dues deny,"
9372,THE ARGUMENT.,Thou canst at least an empty tomb supply.
9373,THE ARGUMENT.,O let not me the widow’s tears renew!
9374,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor let a mother’s curse my name pursue:
9375,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy pious parent, who, for love of thee,"
9376,THE ARGUMENT.,"Forsook the coasts of friendly Sicily,"
9377,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her age committing to the seas and wind,"
9378,THE ARGUMENT.,When ev’ry weary matron stay’d behind.”
9379,THE ARGUMENT.,"To this, Euryalus: “You plead in vain,"
9380,THE ARGUMENT.,And but protract the cause you cannot gain.
9381,THE ARGUMENT.,"No more delays, but haste!” With that, he wakes"
9382,THE ARGUMENT.,The nodding watch; each to his office takes.
9383,THE ARGUMENT.,"The guard reliev’d, the gen’rous couple went"
9384,THE ARGUMENT.,To find the council at the royal tent.
9385,THE ARGUMENT.,
9386,THE ARGUMENT.,"All creatures else forgot their daily care,"
9387,THE ARGUMENT.,"And sleep, the common gift of nature, share;"
9388,THE ARGUMENT.,"Except the Trojan peers, who wakeful sate"
9389,THE ARGUMENT.,In nightly council for th’ indanger’d state.
9390,THE ARGUMENT.,"They vote a message to their absent chief,"
9391,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shew their distress, and beg a swift relief."
9392,THE ARGUMENT.,"Amid the camp a silent seat they chose,"
9393,THE ARGUMENT.,"Remote from clamour, and secure from foes."
9394,THE ARGUMENT.,"On their left arms their ample shields they bear,"
9395,THE ARGUMENT.,The right reclin’d upon the bending spear.
9396,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now Nisus and his friend approach the guard,"
9397,THE ARGUMENT.,"And beg admission, eager to be heard:"
9398,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ affair important, not to be deferr’d."
9399,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ascanius bids ’em be conducted in,"
9400,THE ARGUMENT.,Ord’ring the more experienc’d to begin.
9401,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Nisus thus: “Ye fathers, lend your ears;"
9402,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor judge our bold attempt beyond our years.
9403,THE ARGUMENT.,"The foe, securely drench’d in sleep and wine,"
9404,THE ARGUMENT.,Neglect their watch; the fires but thinly shine;
9405,THE ARGUMENT.,"And where the smoke in cloudy vapours flies,"
9406,THE ARGUMENT.,"Cov’ring the plain, and curling to the skies,"
9407,THE ARGUMENT.,"Betwixt two paths, which at the gate divide,"
9408,THE ARGUMENT.,"Close by the sea, a passage we have spied,"
9409,THE ARGUMENT.,Which will our way to great Aeneas guide.
9410,THE ARGUMENT.,"Expect each hour to see him safe again,"
9411,THE ARGUMENT.,Loaded with spoils of foes in battle slain.
9412,THE ARGUMENT.,Snatch we the lucky minute while we may;
9413,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor can we be mistaken in the way;
9414,THE ARGUMENT.,"For, hunting in the vale, we both have seen"
9415,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rising turrets, and the stream between,"
9416,THE ARGUMENT.,"And know the winding course, with ev’ry ford.”"
9417,THE ARGUMENT.,
9418,THE ARGUMENT.,He ceas’d; and old Alethes took the word:
9419,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Our country gods, in whom our trust we place,"
9420,THE ARGUMENT.,"Will yet from ruin save the Trojan race,"
9421,THE ARGUMENT.,While we behold such dauntless worth appear
9422,THE ARGUMENT.,"In dawning youth, and souls so void of fear.”"
9423,THE ARGUMENT.,Then into tears of joy the father broke;
9424,THE ARGUMENT.,Each in his longing arms by turns he took;
9425,THE ARGUMENT.,Panted and paus’d; and thus again he spoke:
9426,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Ye brave young men, what equal gifts can we,"
9427,THE ARGUMENT.,"In recompense of such desert, decree?"
9428,THE ARGUMENT.,"The greatest, sure, and best you can receive,"
9429,THE ARGUMENT.,The gods and your own conscious worth will give.
9430,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rest our grateful gen’ral will bestow,"
9431,THE ARGUMENT.,And young Ascanius till his manhood owe.”
9432,THE ARGUMENT.,
9433,THE ARGUMENT.,"“And I, whose welfare in my father lies,”"
9434,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ascanius adds, “by the great deities,"
9435,THE ARGUMENT.,"By my dear country, by my household gods,"
9436,THE ARGUMENT.,"By hoary Vesta’s rites and dark abodes,"
9437,THE ARGUMENT.,"Adjure you both, (on you my fortune stands;"
9438,THE ARGUMENT.,"That and my faith I plight into your hands,)"
9439,THE ARGUMENT.,"Make me but happy in his safe return,"
9440,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose wanted presence I can only mourn;
9441,THE ARGUMENT.,Your common gift shall two large goblets be
9442,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of silver, wrought with curious imagery,"
9443,THE ARGUMENT.,"And high emboss’d, which, when old Priam reign’d,"
9444,THE ARGUMENT.,My conqu’ring sire at sack’d Arisba gain’d;
9445,THE ARGUMENT.,"And more, two tripods cast in antique mould,"
9446,THE ARGUMENT.,With two great talents of the finest gold;
9447,THE ARGUMENT.,"Beside a costly bowl, ingrav’d with art,"
9448,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which Dido gave, when first she gave her heart."
9449,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, if in conquer’d Italy we reign,"
9450,THE ARGUMENT.,When spoils by lot the victor shall obtain—
9451,THE ARGUMENT.,Thou saw’st the courser by proud Turnus press’d:
9452,THE ARGUMENT.,"That, Nisus, and his arms, and nodding crest,"
9453,THE ARGUMENT.,"And shield, from chance exempt, shall be thy share:"
9454,THE ARGUMENT.,"Twelve lab’ring slaves, twelve handmaids young and fair"
9455,THE ARGUMENT.,"All clad in rich attire, and train’d with care;"
9456,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, last, a Latian field with fruitful plains,"
9457,THE ARGUMENT.,And a large portion of the king’s domains.
9458,THE ARGUMENT.,"But thou, whose years are more to mine allied,"
9459,THE ARGUMENT.,No fate my vow’d affection shall divide
9460,THE ARGUMENT.,"From thee, heroic youth! Be wholly mine;"
9461,THE ARGUMENT.,Take full possession; all my soul is thine.
9462,THE ARGUMENT.,"One faith, one fame, one fate, shall both attend;"
9463,THE ARGUMENT.,"My life’s companion, and my bosom friend:"
9464,THE ARGUMENT.,"My peace shall be committed to thy care,"
9465,THE ARGUMENT.,And to thy conduct my concerns in war.”
9466,THE ARGUMENT.,
9467,THE ARGUMENT.,Then thus the young Euryalus replied:
9468,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Whatever fortune, good or bad, betide,"
9469,THE ARGUMENT.,"The same shall be my age, as now my youth;"
9470,THE ARGUMENT.,No time shall find me wanting to my truth.
9471,THE ARGUMENT.,This only from your goodness let me gain
9472,THE ARGUMENT.,"(And, this ungranted, all rewards are vain)"
9473,THE ARGUMENT.,Of Priam’s royal race my mother came—
9474,THE ARGUMENT.,And sure the best that ever bore the name—
9475,THE ARGUMENT.,Whom neither Troy nor Sicily could hold
9476,THE ARGUMENT.,"From me departing, but, o’erspent and old,"
9477,THE ARGUMENT.,My fate she follow’d. Ignorant of this
9478,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Whatever) danger, neither parting kiss,"
9479,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor pious blessing taken, her I leave,"
9480,THE ARGUMENT.,And in this only act of all my life deceive.
9481,THE ARGUMENT.,"By this right hand and conscious night I swear,"
9482,THE ARGUMENT.,My soul so sad a farewell could not bear.
9483,THE ARGUMENT.,Be you her comfort; fill my vacant place
9484,THE ARGUMENT.,(Permit me to presume so great a grace)
9485,THE ARGUMENT.,"Support her age, forsaken and distress’d."
9486,THE ARGUMENT.,That hope alone will fortify my breast
9487,THE ARGUMENT.,"Against the worst of fortunes, and of fears.”"
9488,THE ARGUMENT.,He said. The mov’d assistants melt in tears.
9489,THE ARGUMENT.,
9490,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then thus Ascanius, wonderstruck to see"
9491,THE ARGUMENT.,That image of his filial piety:
9492,THE ARGUMENT.,"“So great beginnings, in so green an age,"
9493,THE ARGUMENT.,Exact the faith which I again engage.
9494,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy mother all the dues shall justly claim,"
9495,THE ARGUMENT.,"Creusa had, and only want the name."
9496,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whate’er event thy bold attempt shall have,"
9497,THE ARGUMENT.,’Tis merit to have borne a son so brave.
9498,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now by my head, a sacred oath, I swear,"
9499,THE ARGUMENT.,"(My father us’d it,) what, returning here"
9500,THE ARGUMENT.,"Crown’d with success, I for thyself prepare,"
9501,THE ARGUMENT.,"That, if thou fail, shall thy lov’d mother share.”"
9502,THE ARGUMENT.,
9503,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said, and weeping, while he spoke the word,"
9504,THE ARGUMENT.,"From his broad belt he drew a shining sword,"
9505,THE ARGUMENT.,"Magnificent with gold. Lycaon made,"
9506,THE ARGUMENT.,And in an ivory scabbard sheath’d the blade.
9507,THE ARGUMENT.,This was his gift. Great Mnestheus gave his friend
9508,THE ARGUMENT.,"A lion’s hide, his body to defend;"
9509,THE ARGUMENT.,"And good Alethes furnish’d him, beside,"
9510,THE ARGUMENT.,"With his own trusty helm, of temper tried."
9511,THE ARGUMENT.,
9512,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus arm’d they went. The noble Trojans wait
9513,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their issuing forth, and follow to the gate"
9514,THE ARGUMENT.,With prayers and vows. Above the rest appears
9515,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ascanius, manly far beyond his years,"
9516,THE ARGUMENT.,"And messages committed to their care,"
9517,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which all in winds were lost, and flitting air."
9518,THE ARGUMENT.,
9519,THE ARGUMENT.,The trenches first they pass’d; then took their way
9520,THE ARGUMENT.,Where their proud foes in pitch’d pavilions lay;
9521,THE ARGUMENT.,"To many fatal, ere themselves were slain."
9522,THE ARGUMENT.,"They found the careless host dispers’d upon the plain,"
9523,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who, gorg’d, and drunk with wine, supinely snore."
9524,THE ARGUMENT.,Unharness’d chariots stand along the shore:
9525,THE ARGUMENT.,"Amidst the wheels and reins, the goblet by,"
9526,THE ARGUMENT.,"A medley of debauch and war, they lie."
9527,THE ARGUMENT.,Observing Nisus shew’d his friend the sight:
9528,THE ARGUMENT.,“Behold a conquest gain’d without a fight.
9529,THE ARGUMENT.,"Occasion offers, and I stand prepar’d;"
9530,THE ARGUMENT.,"There lies our way; be thou upon the guard,"
9531,THE ARGUMENT.,"And look around, while I securely go,"
9532,THE ARGUMENT.,And hew a passage thro’ the sleeping foe.”
9533,THE ARGUMENT.,"Softly he spoke; then striding took his way,"
9534,THE ARGUMENT.,"With his drawn sword, where haughty Rhamnes lay;"
9535,THE ARGUMENT.,"His head rais’d high on tapestry beneath,"
9536,THE ARGUMENT.,"And heaving from his breast, he drew his breath;"
9537,THE ARGUMENT.,"A king and prophet, by King Turnus lov’d:"
9538,THE ARGUMENT.,But fate by prescience cannot be remov’d.
9539,THE ARGUMENT.,Him and his sleeping slaves he slew; then spies
9540,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where Remus, with his rich retinue, lies."
9541,THE ARGUMENT.,"His armour-bearer first, and next he kills"
9542,THE ARGUMENT.,"His charioteer, intrench’d betwixt the wheels"
9543,THE ARGUMENT.,And his lov’d horses; last invades their lord;
9544,THE ARGUMENT.,Full on his neck he drives the fatal sword:
9545,THE ARGUMENT.,The gasping head flies off; a purple flood
9546,THE ARGUMENT.,"Flows from the trunk, that welters in the blood,"
9547,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which, by the spurning heels dispers’d around,"
9548,THE ARGUMENT.,The bed besprinkles and bedews the ground.
9549,THE ARGUMENT.,"Lamus the bold, and Lamyrus the strong,"
9550,THE ARGUMENT.,"He slew, and then Serranus fair and young."
9551,THE ARGUMENT.,"From dice and wine the youth retir’d to rest,"
9552,THE ARGUMENT.,And puff’d the fumy god from out his breast:
9553,THE ARGUMENT.,Ev’n then he dreamt of drink and lucky play—
9554,THE ARGUMENT.,"More lucky, had it lasted till the day."
9555,THE ARGUMENT.,"The famish’d lion thus, with hunger bold,"
9556,THE ARGUMENT.,"O’erleaps the fences of the nightly fold,"
9557,THE ARGUMENT.,And tears the peaceful flocks: with silent awe
9558,THE ARGUMENT.,"Trembling they lie, and pant beneath his paw."
9559,THE ARGUMENT.,
9560,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor with less rage Euryalus employs
9561,THE ARGUMENT.,"The wrathful sword, or fewer foes destroys;"
9562,THE ARGUMENT.,But on th’ ignoble crowd his fury flew;
9563,THE ARGUMENT.,"He Fadus, Hebesus, and Rhoetus slew."
9564,THE ARGUMENT.,"Oppress’d with heavy sleep the former fell,"
9565,THE ARGUMENT.,"But Rhoetus wakeful, and observing all:"
9566,THE ARGUMENT.,Behind a spacious jar he slink’d for fear;
9567,THE ARGUMENT.,The fatal iron found and reach’d him there;
9568,THE ARGUMENT.,"For, as he rose, it pierc’d his naked side,"
9569,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, reeking, thence return’d in crimson dyed."
9570,THE ARGUMENT.,The wound pours out a stream of wine and blood;
9571,THE ARGUMENT.,The purple soul comes floating in the flood.
9572,THE ARGUMENT.,
9573,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, where Messapus quarter’d, they arrive."
9574,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fires were fainting there, and just alive;"
9575,THE ARGUMENT.,"The warrior-horses, tied in order, fed."
9576,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nisus observ’d the discipline, and said:"
9577,THE ARGUMENT.,“Our eager thirst of blood may both betray;
9578,THE ARGUMENT.,"And see the scatter’d streaks of dawning day,"
9579,THE ARGUMENT.,"Foe to nocturnal thefts. No more, my friend;"
9580,THE ARGUMENT.,Here let our glutted execution end.
9581,THE ARGUMENT.,A lane thro’ slaughter’d bodies we have made.”
9582,THE ARGUMENT.,"The bold Euryalus, tho’ loth, obey’d."
9583,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of arms, and arras, and of plate, they find"
9584,THE ARGUMENT.,A precious load; but these they leave behind.
9585,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet, fond of gaudy spoils, the boy would stay"
9586,THE ARGUMENT.,"To make the rich caparison his prey,"
9587,THE ARGUMENT.,Which on the steed of conquer’d Rhamnes lay.
9588,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor did his eyes less longingly behold
9589,THE ARGUMENT.,"The girdle-belt, with nails of burnish’d gold."
9590,THE ARGUMENT.,This present Caedicus the rich bestow’d
9591,THE ARGUMENT.,"On Remulus, when friendship first they vow’d,"
9592,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, absent, join’d in hospitable ties:"
9593,THE ARGUMENT.,"He, dying, to his heir bequeath’d the prize;"
9594,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till, by the conqu’ring Ardean troops oppress’d,"
9595,THE ARGUMENT.,He fell; and they the glorious gift possess’d.
9596,THE ARGUMENT.,These glitt’ring spoils (now made the victor’s gain)
9597,THE ARGUMENT.,"He to his body suits, but suits in vain:"
9598,THE ARGUMENT.,"Messapus’ helm he finds among the rest,"
9599,THE ARGUMENT.,"And laces on, and wears the waving crest."
9600,THE ARGUMENT.,"Proud of their conquest, prouder of their prey,"
9601,THE ARGUMENT.,"They leave the camp, and take the ready way."
9602,THE ARGUMENT.,
9603,THE ARGUMENT.,"But far they had not pass’d, before they spied"
9604,THE ARGUMENT.,"Three hundred horse, with Volscens for their guide."
9605,THE ARGUMENT.,The queen a legion to King Turnus sent;
9606,THE ARGUMENT.,"But the swift horse the slower foot prevent,"
9607,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now, advancing, sought the leader’s tent."
9608,THE ARGUMENT.,"They saw the pair; for, thro’ the doubtful shade,"
9609,THE ARGUMENT.,"His shining helm Euryalus betray’d,"
9610,THE ARGUMENT.,On which the moon with full reflection play’d.
9611,THE ARGUMENT.,"“’Tis not for naught,” cried Volscens from the crowd,"
9612,THE ARGUMENT.,“These men go there;” then rais’d his voice aloud:
9613,THE ARGUMENT.,“Stand! stand! why thus in arms? And whither bent?
9614,THE ARGUMENT.,"From whence, to whom, and on what errand sent?”"
9615,THE ARGUMENT.,"Silent they scud away, and haste their flight"
9616,THE ARGUMENT.,"To neighb’ring woods, and trust themselves to night."
9617,THE ARGUMENT.,"The speedy horse all passages belay,"
9618,THE ARGUMENT.,"And spur their smoking steeds to cross their way,"
9619,THE ARGUMENT.,And watch each entrance of the winding wood.
9620,THE ARGUMENT.,"Black was the forest: thick with beech it stood,"
9621,THE ARGUMENT.,"Horrid with fern, and intricate with thorn;"
9622,THE ARGUMENT.,"Few paths of human feet, or tracks of beasts, were worn."
9623,THE ARGUMENT.,"The darkness of the shades, his heavy prey,"
9624,THE ARGUMENT.,"And fear, misled the younger from his way."
9625,THE ARGUMENT.,"But Nisus hit the turns with happier haste,"
9626,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, thoughtless of his friend, the forest pass’d,"
9627,THE ARGUMENT.,"And Alban plains, from Alba’s name so call’d,"
9628,THE ARGUMENT.,Where King Latinus then his oxen stall’d;
9629,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till, turning at the length, he stood his ground,"
9630,THE ARGUMENT.,"And miss’d his friend, and cast his eyes around:"
9631,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Ah wretch!” he cried, “where have I left behind"
9632,THE ARGUMENT.,Th’ unhappy youth? where shall I hope to find?
9633,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or what way take?” Again he ventures back,"
9634,THE ARGUMENT.,And treads the mazes of his former track.
9635,THE ARGUMENT.,"He winds the wood, and, list’ning, hears the noise"
9636,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of tramping coursers, and the riders’ voice."
9637,THE ARGUMENT.,The sound approach’d; and suddenly he view’d
9638,THE ARGUMENT.,"The foes inclosing, and his friend pursued,"
9639,THE ARGUMENT.,"Forelaid and taken, while he strove in vain"
9640,THE ARGUMENT.,The shelter of the friendly shades to gain.
9641,THE ARGUMENT.,"What should he next attempt? what arms employ,"
9642,THE ARGUMENT.,"What fruitless force, to free the captive boy?"
9643,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or desperate should he rush and lose his life,"
9644,THE ARGUMENT.,"With odds oppress’d, in such unequal strife?"
9645,THE ARGUMENT.,
9646,THE ARGUMENT.,"Resolv’d at length, his pointed spear he shook;"
9647,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, casting on the moon a mournful look:"
9648,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Guardian of groves, and goddess of the night,"
9649,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fair queen,” he said, “direct my dart aright."
9650,THE ARGUMENT.,"If e’er my pious father, for my sake,"
9651,THE ARGUMENT.,"Did grateful off’rings on thy altars make,"
9652,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or I increas’d them with my sylvan toils,"
9653,THE ARGUMENT.,"And hung thy holy roofs with savage spoils,"
9654,THE ARGUMENT.,Give me to scatter these.” Then from his ear
9655,THE ARGUMENT.,"He pois’d, and aim’d, and launch’d the trembling spear."
9656,THE ARGUMENT.,"The deadly weapon, hissing from the grove,"
9657,THE ARGUMENT.,Impetuous on the back of Sulmo drove;
9658,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pierc’d his thin armour, drank his vital blood,"
9659,THE ARGUMENT.,And in his body left the broken wood.
9660,THE ARGUMENT.,"He staggers round; his eyeballs roll in death,"
9661,THE ARGUMENT.,And with short sobs he gasps away his breath.
9662,THE ARGUMENT.,All stand amaz’d—a second jav’lin flies
9663,THE ARGUMENT.,"With equal strength, and quivers thro’ the skies."
9664,THE ARGUMENT.,"This thro’ thy temples, Tagus, forc’d the way,"
9665,THE ARGUMENT.,And in the brainpan warmly buried lay.
9666,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fierce Volscens foams with rage, and, gazing round,"
9667,THE ARGUMENT.,"Descried not him who gave the fatal wound,"
9668,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor knew to fix revenge: “But thou,” he cries,"
9669,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Shalt pay for both,” and at the pris’ner flies"
9670,THE ARGUMENT.,"With his drawn sword. Then, struck with deep despair,"
9671,THE ARGUMENT.,That cruel sight the lover could not bear;
9672,THE ARGUMENT.,"But from his covert rush’d in open view,"
9673,THE ARGUMENT.,And sent his voice before him as he flew:
9674,THE ARGUMENT.,“Me! me!” he cried—“turn all your swords alone
9675,THE ARGUMENT.,"On me—the fact confess’d, the fault my own."
9676,THE ARGUMENT.,"He neither could nor durst, the guiltless youth:"
9677,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ye moon and stars, bear witness to the truth!"
9678,THE ARGUMENT.,His only crime (if friendship can offend)
9679,THE ARGUMENT.,Is too much love to his unhappy friend.”
9680,THE ARGUMENT.,"Too late he speaks: the sword, which fury guides,"
9681,THE ARGUMENT.,"Driv’n with full force, had pierc’d his tender sides."
9682,THE ARGUMENT.,Down fell the beauteous youth: the yawning wound
9683,THE ARGUMENT.,"Gush’d out a purple stream, and stain’d the ground."
9684,THE ARGUMENT.,"His snowy neck reclines upon his breast,"
9685,THE ARGUMENT.,Like a fair flow’r by the keen share oppress’d;
9686,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like a white poppy sinking on the plain,"
9687,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose heavy head is overcharg’d with rain.
9688,THE ARGUMENT.,"Despair, and rage, and vengeance justly vow’d,"
9689,THE ARGUMENT.,Drove Nisus headlong on the hostile crowd.
9690,THE ARGUMENT.,Volscens he seeks; on him alone he bends:
9691,THE ARGUMENT.,"Borne back and bor’d by his surrounding friends,"
9692,THE ARGUMENT.,"Onward he press’d, and kept him still in sight;"
9693,THE ARGUMENT.,Then whirl’d aloft his sword with all his might:
9694,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ unerring steel descended while he spoke,"
9695,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pierc’d his wide mouth, and thro’ his weazon broke."
9696,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dying, he slew; and, stagg’ring on the plain,"
9697,THE ARGUMENT.,With swimming eyes he sought his lover slain;
9698,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then quiet on his bleeding bosom fell,"
9699,THE ARGUMENT.,"Content, in death, to be reveng’d so well."
9700,THE ARGUMENT.,
9701,THE ARGUMENT.,"O happy friends! for, if my verse can give"
9702,THE ARGUMENT.,"Immortal life, your fame shall ever live,"
9703,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fix’d as the Capitol’s foundation lies,"
9704,THE ARGUMENT.,"And spread, where’er the Roman eagle flies!"
9705,THE ARGUMENT.,
9706,THE ARGUMENT.,"The conqu’ring party first divide the prey,"
9707,THE ARGUMENT.,Then their slain leader to the camp convey.
9708,THE ARGUMENT.,"With wonder, as they went, the troops were fill’d,"
9709,THE ARGUMENT.,To see such numbers whom so few had kill’d.
9710,THE ARGUMENT.,"Serranus, Rhamnes, and the rest, they found:"
9711,THE ARGUMENT.,Vast crowds the dying and the dead surround;
9712,THE ARGUMENT.,And the yet reeking blood o’erflows the ground.
9713,THE ARGUMENT.,"All knew the helmet which Messapus lost,"
9714,THE ARGUMENT.,But mourn’d a purchase that so dear had cost.
9715,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now rose the ruddy morn from Tithon’s bed,"
9716,THE ARGUMENT.,And with the dawn of day the skies o’erspread;
9717,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor long the sun his daily course withheld,"
9718,THE ARGUMENT.,But added colours to the world reveal’d:
9719,THE ARGUMENT.,"When early Turnus, wak’ning with the light,"
9720,THE ARGUMENT.,"All clad in armour, calls his troops to fight."
9721,THE ARGUMENT.,"His martial men with fierce harangue he fir’d,"
9722,THE ARGUMENT.,And his own ardour in their souls inspir’d.
9723,THE ARGUMENT.,"This done—to give new terror to his foes,"
9724,THE ARGUMENT.,"The heads of Nisus and his friend he shows,"
9725,THE ARGUMENT.,Rais’d high on pointed spears—a ghastly sight:
9726,THE ARGUMENT.,"Loud peals of shouts ensue, and barbarous delight."
9727,THE ARGUMENT.,
9728,THE ARGUMENT.,"Meantime the Trojans run, where danger calls;"
9729,THE ARGUMENT.,"They line their trenches, and they man their walls."
9730,THE ARGUMENT.,In front extended to the left they stood;
9731,THE ARGUMENT.,"Safe was the right, surrounded by the flood."
9732,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, casting from their tow’rs a frightful view,"
9733,THE ARGUMENT.,"They saw the faces, which too well they knew,"
9734,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tho’ then disguis’d in death, and smear’d all o’er"
9735,THE ARGUMENT.,"With filth obscene, and dropping putrid gore."
9736,THE ARGUMENT.,Soon hasty fame thro’ the sad city bears
9737,THE ARGUMENT.,The mournful message to the mother’s ears.
9738,THE ARGUMENT.,An icy cold benumbs her limbs; she shakes;
9739,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her cheeks the blood, her hand the web forsakes."
9740,THE ARGUMENT.,"She runs the rampires round amidst the war,"
9741,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor fears the flying darts; she rends her hair,"
9742,THE ARGUMENT.,And fills with loud laments the liquid air.
9743,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Thus, then, my lov’d Euryalus appears!"
9744,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus looks the prop of my declining years!
9745,THE ARGUMENT.,Was’t on this face my famish’d eyes I fed?
9746,THE ARGUMENT.,Ah! how unlike the living is the dead!
9747,THE ARGUMENT.,"And could’st thou leave me, cruel, thus alone?"
9748,THE ARGUMENT.,Not one kind kiss from a departing son!
9749,THE ARGUMENT.,"No look, no last adieu before he went,"
9750,THE ARGUMENT.,In an ill-boding hour to slaughter sent!
9751,THE ARGUMENT.,"Cold on the ground, and pressing foreign clay,"
9752,THE ARGUMENT.,To Latian dogs and fowls he lies a prey!
9753,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor was I near to close his dying eyes,"
9754,THE ARGUMENT.,"To wash his wounds, to weep his obsequies,"
9755,THE ARGUMENT.,"To call about his corpse his crying friends,"
9756,THE ARGUMENT.,Or spread the mantle (made for other ends)
9757,THE ARGUMENT.,"On his dear body, which I wove with care,"
9758,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor did my daily pains or nightly labour spare.
9759,THE ARGUMENT.,Where shall I find his corpse? what earth sustains
9760,THE ARGUMENT.,"His trunk dismember’d, and his cold remains?"
9761,THE ARGUMENT.,"For this, alas! I left my needful ease,"
9762,THE ARGUMENT.,Expos’d my life to winds and winter seas!
9763,THE ARGUMENT.,"If any pity touch Rutulian hearts,"
9764,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here empty all your quivers, all your darts;"
9765,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or, if they fail, thou, Jove, conclude my woe,"
9766,THE ARGUMENT.,And send me thunderstruck to shades below!”
9767,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her shrieks and clamours pierce the Trojans’ ears,"
9768,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unman their courage, and augment their fears;"
9769,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor young Ascanius could the sight sustain,"
9770,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor old Ilioneus his tears restrain,"
9771,THE ARGUMENT.,"But Actor and Idaeus jointly sent,"
9772,THE ARGUMENT.,To bear the madding mother to her tent.
9773,THE ARGUMENT.,
9774,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now the trumpets terribly, from far,"
9775,THE ARGUMENT.,"With rattling clangour, rouse the sleepy war."
9776,THE ARGUMENT.,The soldiers’ shouts succeed the brazen sounds;
9777,THE ARGUMENT.,"And heav’n, from pole to pole, the noise rebounds."
9778,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Volscians bear their shields upon their head,"
9779,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, rushing forward, form a moving shed."
9780,THE ARGUMENT.,These fill the ditch; those pull the bulwarks down:
9781,THE ARGUMENT.,Some raise the ladders; others scale the town.
9782,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, where void spaces on the walls appear,"
9783,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or thin defence, they pour their forces there."
9784,THE ARGUMENT.,"With poles and missive weapons, from afar,"
9785,THE ARGUMENT.,The Trojans keep aloof the rising war.
9786,THE ARGUMENT.,"Taught, by their ten years’ siege, defensive fight,"
9787,THE ARGUMENT.,"They roll down ribs of rocks, an unresisted weight,"
9788,THE ARGUMENT.,"To break the penthouse with the pond’rous blow,"
9789,THE ARGUMENT.,Which yet the patient Volscians undergo:
9790,THE ARGUMENT.,But could not bear th’ unequal combat long;
9791,THE ARGUMENT.,"For, where the Trojans find the thickest throng,"
9792,THE ARGUMENT.,"The ruin falls: their shatter’d shields give way,"
9793,THE ARGUMENT.,And their crush’d heads become an easy prey.
9794,THE ARGUMENT.,"They shrink for fear, abated of their rage,"
9795,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor longer dare in a blind fight engage;
9796,THE ARGUMENT.,Contented now to gall them from below
9797,THE ARGUMENT.,"With darts and slings, and with the distant bow."
9798,THE ARGUMENT.,
9799,THE ARGUMENT.,"Elsewhere Mezentius, terrible to view,"
9800,THE ARGUMENT.,A blazing pine within the trenches threw.
9801,THE ARGUMENT.,"But brave Messapus, Neptune’s warlike son,"
9802,THE ARGUMENT.,"Broke down the palisades, the trenches won,"
9803,THE ARGUMENT.,"And loud for ladders calls, to scale the town."
9804,THE ARGUMENT.,
9805,THE ARGUMENT.,"Calliope, begin! Ye sacred Nine,"
9806,THE ARGUMENT.,"Inspire your poet in his high design,"
9807,THE ARGUMENT.,"To sing what slaughter manly Turnus made,"
9808,THE ARGUMENT.,"What souls he sent below the Stygian shade,"
9809,THE ARGUMENT.,"What fame the soldiers with their captain share,"
9810,THE ARGUMENT.,And the vast circuit of the fatal war;
9811,THE ARGUMENT.,For you in singing martial facts excel;
9812,THE ARGUMENT.,"You best remember, and alone can tell."
9813,THE ARGUMENT.,
9814,THE ARGUMENT.,"There stood a tow’r, amazing to the sight,"
9815,THE ARGUMENT.,"Built up of beams, and of stupendous height:"
9816,THE ARGUMENT.,"Art, and the nature of the place, conspir’d"
9817,THE ARGUMENT.,To furnish all the strength that war requir’d.
9818,THE ARGUMENT.,"To level this, the bold Italians join;"
9819,THE ARGUMENT.,The wary Trojans obviate their design;
9820,THE ARGUMENT.,"With weighty stones o’erwhelm their troops below,"
9821,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shoot thro’ the loopholes, and sharp jav’lins throw."
9822,THE ARGUMENT.,"Turnus, the chief, toss’d from his thund’ring hand"
9823,THE ARGUMENT.,"Against the wooden walls, a flaming brand:"
9824,THE ARGUMENT.,"It stuck, the fiery plague; the winds were high;"
9825,THE ARGUMENT.,"The planks were season’d, and the timber dry."
9826,THE ARGUMENT.,"Contagion caught the posts; it spread along,"
9827,THE ARGUMENT.,"Scorch’d, and to distance drove the scatter’d throng."
9828,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojans fled; the fire pursued amain,"
9829,THE ARGUMENT.,Still gath’ring fast upon the trembling train;
9830,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till, crowding to the corners of the wall,"
9831,THE ARGUMENT.,Down the defence and the defenders fall.
9832,THE ARGUMENT.,The mighty flaw makes heav’n itself resound:
9833,THE ARGUMENT.,The dead and dying Trojans strew the ground.
9834,THE ARGUMENT.,"The tow’r, that follow’d on the fallen crew,"
9835,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whelm’d o’er their heads, and buried whom it slew:"
9836,THE ARGUMENT.,Some stuck upon the darts themselves had sent;
9837,THE ARGUMENT.,All the same equal ruin underwent.
9838,THE ARGUMENT.,
9839,THE ARGUMENT.,Young Lycus and Helenor only scape;
9840,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sav’d—how, they know not—from the steepy leap."
9841,THE ARGUMENT.,"Helenor, elder of the two: by birth,"
9842,THE ARGUMENT.,"On one side royal, one a son of earth,"
9843,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whom to the Lydian king Licymnia bare,"
9844,THE ARGUMENT.,And sent her boasted bastard to the war
9845,THE ARGUMENT.,(A privilege which none but freemen share).
9846,THE ARGUMENT.,"Slight were his arms, a sword and silver shield:"
9847,THE ARGUMENT.,No marks of honour charg’d its empty field.
9848,THE ARGUMENT.,"Light as he fell, so light the youth arose,"
9849,THE ARGUMENT.,"And rising, found himself amidst his foes;"
9850,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor flight was left, nor hopes to force his way."
9851,THE ARGUMENT.,"Embolden’d by despair, he stood at bay;"
9852,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, like a stag, whom all the troop surrounds"
9853,THE ARGUMENT.,Of eager huntsmen and invading hounds
9854,THE ARGUMENT.,"Resolv’d on death, he dissipates his fears,"
9855,THE ARGUMENT.,And bounds aloft against the pointed spears:
9856,THE ARGUMENT.,"So dares the youth, secure of death; and throws"
9857,THE ARGUMENT.,His dying body on his thickest foes.
9858,THE ARGUMENT.,"But Lycus, swifter of his feet by far,"
9859,THE ARGUMENT.,"Runs, doubles, winds and turns, amidst the war;"
9860,THE ARGUMENT.,"Springs to the walls, and leaves his foes behind,"
9861,THE ARGUMENT.,And snatches at the beam he first can find;
9862,THE ARGUMENT.,"Looks up, and leaps aloft at all the stretch,"
9863,THE ARGUMENT.,In hopes the helping hand of some kind friend to reach.
9864,THE ARGUMENT.,But Turnus follow’d hard his hunted prey
9865,THE ARGUMENT.,"(His spear had almost reach’d him in the way,"
9866,THE ARGUMENT.,"Short of his reins, and scarce a span behind)"
9867,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Fool!” said the chief, “tho’ fleeter than the wind,"
9868,THE ARGUMENT.,"Couldst thou presume to scape, when I pursue?”"
9869,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said, and downward by the feet he drew"
9870,THE ARGUMENT.,The trembling dastard; at the tug he falls;
9871,THE ARGUMENT.,"Vast ruins come along, rent from the smoking walls."
9872,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus on some silver swan, or tim’rous hare,"
9873,THE ARGUMENT.,Jove’s bird comes sousing down from upper air;
9874,THE ARGUMENT.,Her crooked talons truss the fearful prey:
9875,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then out of sight she soars, and wings her way."
9876,THE ARGUMENT.,"So seizes the grim wolf the tender lamb,"

9881,THE ARGUMENT.,"The ditch with fagots fill’d, the daring foe"
9882,THE ARGUMENT.,Toss’d firebrands to the steepy turrets throw.

9886,THE ARGUMENT.,"Roll’d down the fragment of a rock so right,"
9887,THE ARGUMENT.,It crush’d him double underneath the weight.
9888,THE ARGUMENT.,Two more young Liger and Asylas slew:
9889,THE ARGUMENT.,To bend the bow young Liger better knew;
9890,THE ARGUMENT.,Asylas best the pointed jav’lin threw.
9891,THE ARGUMENT.,Brave Caeneus laid Ortygius on the plain;
9892,THE ARGUMENT.,The victor Caeneus was by Turnus slain.

9894,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sagar, and Ida, standing on the wall."
9895,THE ARGUMENT.,From Capys’ arms his fate Privernus found:
9896,THE ARGUMENT.,Hurt by Themilla first—but slight the wound—
9897,THE ARGUMENT.,"His shield thrown by, to mitigate the smart,"
9898,THE ARGUMENT.,He clapp’d his hand upon the wounded part:
9899,THE ARGUMENT.,"The second shaft came swift and unespied,"
9900,THE ARGUMENT.,"And pierc’d his hand, and nail’d it to his side,"
9901,THE ARGUMENT.,Transfix’d his breathing lungs and beating heart:

9911,THE ARGUMENT.,"Laid by the lance, and took him to the sling,"
9912,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thrice whirl’d the thong around his head, and threw:"
9913,THE ARGUMENT.,The heated lead half melted as it flew;
9914,THE ARGUMENT.,It pierc’d his hollow temples and his brain;
9915,THE ARGUMENT.,"The youth came tumbling down, and spurn’d the plain."
9916,THE ARGUMENT.,
9917,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then young Ascanius, who, before this day,"
9918,THE ARGUMENT.,"Was wont in woods to shoot the savage prey,"
9919,THE ARGUMENT.,"First bent in martial strife the twanging bow,"
9920,THE ARGUMENT.,And exercis’d against a human foe—
9921,THE ARGUMENT.,"With this bereft Numanus of his life,"
9922,THE ARGUMENT.,Who Turnus’ younger sister took to wife.
9923,THE ARGUMENT.,"Proud of his realm, and of his royal bride,"
9924,THE ARGUMENT.,"Vaunting before his troops, and lengthen’d with a stride,"
9925,THE ARGUMENT.,In these insulting terms the Trojans he defied:
9926,THE ARGUMENT.,
9927,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Twice-conquer’d cowards, now your shame is shown—"
9928,THE ARGUMENT.,Coop’d up a second time within your town!
9929,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who dare not issue forth in open field,"
9930,THE ARGUMENT.,But hold your walls before you for a shield.
9931,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus treat you war? thus our alliance force?
9932,THE ARGUMENT.,"What gods, what madness, hither steer’d your course?"
9933,THE ARGUMENT.,"You shall not find the sons of Atreus here,"
9934,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor need the frauds of sly Ulysses fear.
9935,THE ARGUMENT.,"Strong from the cradle, of a sturdy brood,"
9936,THE ARGUMENT.,We bear our newborn infants to the flood;

9961,THE ARGUMENT.,"Go, Phrygians, to your Dindymus again!"
9962,THE ARGUMENT.,"Go, less than women, in the shapes of men!"
9963,THE ARGUMENT.,"Go, mix’d with eunuchs, in the Mother’s rites,"

9967,THE ARGUMENT.,
9968,THE ARGUMENT.,This foul reproach Ascanius could not hear
9969,THE ARGUMENT.,"With patience, or a vow’d revenge forbear."
9970,THE ARGUMENT.,"At the full stretch of both his hands he drew,"
9971,THE ARGUMENT.,And almost join’d the horns of the tough yew.
9972,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, first, before the throne of Jove he stood,"
9973,THE ARGUMENT.,And thus with lifted hands invok’d the god:
9974,THE ARGUMENT.,"“My first attempt, great Jupiter, succeed!"
9975,THE ARGUMENT.,An annual off’ring in thy grove shall bleed;
9976,THE ARGUMENT.,"A snow-white steer, before thy altar led,"

9980,THE ARGUMENT.,
9981,THE ARGUMENT.,"Jove bow’d the heav’ns, and lent a gracious ear,"
9982,THE ARGUMENT.,"And thunder’d on the left, amidst the clear."
9983,THE ARGUMENT.,Sounded at once the bow; and swiftly flies
9984,THE ARGUMENT.,"The feather’d death, and hisses thro’ the skies."
9985,THE ARGUMENT.,The steel thro’ both his temples forc’d the way:
9986,THE ARGUMENT.,"Extended on the ground, Numanus lay."
9987,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Go now, vain boaster, and true valour scorn!"
9988,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Phrygians, twice subdued, yet make this third return.”"
9989,THE ARGUMENT.,Ascanius said no more. The Trojans shake
9990,THE ARGUMENT.,"The heav’ns with shouting, and new vigour take."
9991,THE ARGUMENT.,
9992,THE ARGUMENT.,"Apollo then bestrode a golden cloud,"
9993,THE ARGUMENT.,"To view the feats of arms, and fighting crowd;"
9994,THE ARGUMENT.,And thus the beardless victor he bespoke aloud:
9995,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Advance, illustrious youth, increase in fame,"
9996,THE ARGUMENT.,And wide from east to west extend thy name;
9997,THE ARGUMENT.,Offspring of gods thyself; and Rome shall owe

10001,THE ARGUMENT.,"To thee, to them, and their victorious heirs,"
10002,THE ARGUMENT.,"The conquer’d war is due, and the vast world is theirs."
10003,THE ARGUMENT.,"Troy is too narrow for thy name.” He said,"
10004,THE ARGUMENT.,And plunging downward shot his radiant head;
10005,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dispell’d the breathing air, that broke his flight:"
10006,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shorn of his beams, a man to mortal sight."
10007,THE ARGUMENT.,"Old Butes’ form he took, Anchises’ squire,"
10008,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now left, to rule Ascanius, by his sire:"
10009,THE ARGUMENT.,"His wrinkled visage, and his hoary hairs,"
10010,THE ARGUMENT.,"His mien, his habit, and his arms, he wears,"
10011,THE ARGUMENT.,"And thus salutes the boy, too forward for his years:"
10012,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Suffice it thee, thy father’s worthy son,"
10013,THE ARGUMENT.,The warlike prize thou hast already won.
10014,THE ARGUMENT.,The god of archers gives thy youth a part
10015,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of his own praise, nor envies equal art."
10016,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now tempt the war no more.” He said, and flew"
10017,THE ARGUMENT.,"Obscure in air, and vanish’d from their view."
10018,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojans, by his arms, their patron know,"
10019,THE ARGUMENT.,And hear the twanging of his heav’nly bow.
10020,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then duteous force they use, and Phoebus’ name,"
10021,THE ARGUMENT.,To keep from fight the youth too fond of fame.
10022,THE ARGUMENT.,"Undaunted, they themselves no danger shun;"
10023,THE ARGUMENT.,From wall to wall the shouts and clamours run.
10024,THE ARGUMENT.,They bend their bows; they whirl their slings around;
10025,THE ARGUMENT.,"Heaps of spent arrows fall, and strew the ground;"
10026,THE ARGUMENT.,"And helms, and shields, and rattling arms resound."
10027,THE ARGUMENT.,"The combat thickens, like the storm that flies"
10028,THE ARGUMENT.,"From westward, when the show’ry Kids arise;"
10029,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or patt’ring hail comes pouring on the main,"
10030,THE ARGUMENT.,"When Jupiter descends in harden’d rain,"
10031,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or bellowing clouds burst with a stormy sound,"
10032,THE ARGUMENT.,And with an armed winter strew the ground.
10033,THE ARGUMENT.,
10034,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pand’rus and Bitias, thunderbolts of war,"
10035,THE ARGUMENT.,Whom Hiera to bold Alcanor bare
10036,THE ARGUMENT.,"On Ida’s top, two youths of height and size"
10037,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like firs that on their mother mountain rise,"
10038,THE ARGUMENT.,"Presuming on their force, the gates unbar,"
10039,THE ARGUMENT.,And of their own accord invite the war.
10040,THE ARGUMENT.,"With fates averse, against their king’s command,"
10041,THE ARGUMENT.,"Arm’d, on the right and on the left they stand,"
10042,THE ARGUMENT.,"And flank the passage: shining steel they wear,"
10043,THE ARGUMENT.,And waving crests above their heads appear.
10044,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus two tall oaks, that Padus’ banks adorn,"
10045,THE ARGUMENT.,"Lift up to heav’n their leafy heads unshorn,"
10046,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, overpress’d with nature’s heavy load,"
10047,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dance to the whistling winds, and at each other nod."
10048,THE ARGUMENT.,"In flows a tide of Latians, when they see"
10049,THE ARGUMENT.,"The gate set open, and the passage free;"
10050,THE ARGUMENT.,"Bold Quercens, with rash Tmarus, rushing on,"
10051,THE ARGUMENT.,"Equicolus, that in bright armour shone,"
10052,THE ARGUMENT.,"And Haemon first; but soon repuls’d they fly,"
10053,THE ARGUMENT.,Or in the well-defended pass they die.
10054,THE ARGUMENT.,"These with success are fir’d, and those with rage,"
10055,THE ARGUMENT.,And each on equal terms at length engage.
10056,THE ARGUMENT.,"Drawn from their lines, and issuing on the plain,"
10057,THE ARGUMENT.,The Trojans hand to hand the fight maintain.
10058,THE ARGUMENT.,
10059,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fierce Turnus in another quarter fought,"
10060,THE ARGUMENT.,"When suddenly th’ unhop’d-for news was brought,"
10061,THE ARGUMENT.,"The foes had left the fastness of their place,"
10062,THE ARGUMENT.,"Prevail’d in fight, and had his men in chase."
10063,THE ARGUMENT.,"He quits th’ attack, and, to prevent their fate,"
10064,THE ARGUMENT.,Runs where the giant brothers guard the gate.
10065,THE ARGUMENT.,"The first he met, Antiphates the brave,"
10066,THE ARGUMENT.,"But base-begotten on a Theban slave,"
10067,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sarpedon’s son, he slew: the deadly dart"
10068,THE ARGUMENT.,"Found passage thro’ his breast, and pierc’d his heart."
10069,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fix’d in the wound th’ Italian cornel stood,"
10070,THE ARGUMENT.,"Warm’d in his lungs, and in his vital blood."
10071,THE ARGUMENT.,"Aphidnus next, and Erymanthus dies,"
10072,THE ARGUMENT.,"And Meropes, and the gigantic size"
10073,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of Bitias, threat’ning with his ardent eyes."
10074,THE ARGUMENT.,Not by the feeble dart he fell oppress’d
10075,THE ARGUMENT.,"(A dart were lost within that roomy breast),"
10076,THE ARGUMENT.,"But from a knotted lance, large, heavy, strong,"
10077,THE ARGUMENT.,Which roar’d like thunder as it whirl’d along:
10078,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not two bull hides th’ impetuous force withhold,"
10079,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor coat of double mail, with scales of gold."
10080,THE ARGUMENT.,Down sunk the monster bulk and press’d the ground;
10081,THE ARGUMENT.,"His arms and clatt’ring shield on the vast body sound,"
10082,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not with less ruin than the Bajan mole,"
10083,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rais’d on the seas, the surges to control—"
10084,THE ARGUMENT.,At once comes tumbling down the rocky wall;
10085,THE ARGUMENT.,"Prone to the deep, the stones disjointed fall"
10086,THE ARGUMENT.,Of the vast pile; the scatter’d ocean flies;
10087,THE ARGUMENT.,"Black sands, discolour’d froth, and mingled mud arise:"
10088,THE ARGUMENT.,"The frighted billows roll, and seek the shores;"
10089,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then trembles Prochyta, then Ischia roars:"
10090,THE ARGUMENT.,"Typhoeus, thrown beneath, by Jove’s command,"
10091,THE ARGUMENT.,"Astonish’d at the flaw that shakes the land,"
10092,THE ARGUMENT.,"Soon shifts his weary side, and, scarce awake,"
10093,THE ARGUMENT.,With wonder feels the weight press lighter on his back.
10094,THE ARGUMENT.,
10095,THE ARGUMENT.,"The warrior god the Latian troops inspir’d,"
10096,THE ARGUMENT.,"New strung their sinews, and their courage fir’d,"
10097,THE ARGUMENT.,But chills the Trojan hearts with cold affright:
10098,THE ARGUMENT.,Then black despair precipitates their flight.
10099,THE ARGUMENT.,
10100,THE ARGUMENT.,"When Pandarus beheld his brother kill’d,"
10101,THE ARGUMENT.,"The town with fear and wild confusion fill’d,"
10102,THE ARGUMENT.,He turns the hinges of the heavy gate
10103,THE ARGUMENT.,"With both his hands, and adds his shoulders to the weight"
10104,THE ARGUMENT.,Some happier friends within the walls inclos’d;
10105,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rest shut out, to certain death expos’d:"
10106,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fool as he was, and frantic in his care,"
10107,THE ARGUMENT.,"T’ admit young Turnus, and include the war!"
10108,THE ARGUMENT.,"He thrust amid the crowd, securely bold,"
10109,THE ARGUMENT.,Like a fierce tiger pent amid the fold.
10110,THE ARGUMENT.,"Too late his blazing buckler they descry,"
10111,THE ARGUMENT.,"And sparkling fires that shot from either eye,"
10112,THE ARGUMENT.,"His mighty members, and his ample breast,"
10113,THE ARGUMENT.,"His rattling armour, and his crimson crest."
10114,THE ARGUMENT.,
10115,THE ARGUMENT.,"Far from that hated face the Trojans fly,"
10116,THE ARGUMENT.,All but the fool who sought his destiny.
10117,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mad Pandarus steps forth, with vengeance vow’d"
10118,THE ARGUMENT.,"For Bitias’ death, and threatens thus aloud:"
10119,THE ARGUMENT.,"“These are not Ardea’s walls, nor this the town"
10120,THE ARGUMENT.,Amata proffers with Lavinia’s crown:
10121,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Tis hostile earth you tread. Of hope bereft,"
10122,THE ARGUMENT.,No means of safe return by flight are left.”
10123,THE ARGUMENT.,"To whom, with count’nance calm, and soul sedate,"
10124,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus Turnus: “Then begin, and try thy fate:"
10125,THE ARGUMENT.,My message to the ghost of Priam bear;
10126,THE ARGUMENT.,Tell him a new Achilles sent thee there.”
10127,THE ARGUMENT.,
10128,THE ARGUMENT.,"A lance of tough ground ash the Trojan threw,"
10129,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rough in the rind, and knotted as it grew:"
10130,THE ARGUMENT.,With his full force he whirl’d it first around;
10131,THE ARGUMENT.,But the soft yielding air receiv’d the wound:
10132,THE ARGUMENT.,"Imperial Juno turn’d the course before,"
10133,THE ARGUMENT.,And fix’d the wand’ring weapon in the door.
10134,THE ARGUMENT.,
10135,THE ARGUMENT.,"“But hope not thou,” said Turnus, “when I strike,"
10136,THE ARGUMENT.,"To shun thy fate: our force is not alike,"
10137,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor thy steel temper’d by the Lemnian god.”
10138,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then rising, on his utmost stretch he stood,"
10139,THE ARGUMENT.,And aim’d from high: the full descending blow
10140,THE ARGUMENT.,Cleaves the broad front and beardless cheeks in two.
10141,THE ARGUMENT.,Down sinks the giant with a thund’ring sound:
10142,THE ARGUMENT.,His pond’rous limbs oppress the trembling ground;
10143,THE ARGUMENT.,"Blood, brains, and foam gush from the gaping wound:"
10144,THE ARGUMENT.,"Scalp, face, and shoulders the keen steel divides,"
10145,THE ARGUMENT.,And the shar’d visage hangs on equal sides.
10146,THE ARGUMENT.,The Trojans fly from their approaching fate;
10147,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, had the victor then secur’d the gate,"
10148,THE ARGUMENT.,"And to his troops without unclos’d the bars,"
10149,THE ARGUMENT.,One lucky day had ended all his wars.
10150,THE ARGUMENT.,"But boiling youth, and blind desire of blood,"
10151,THE ARGUMENT.,"Push’d on his fury, to pursue the crowd."
10152,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hamstring’d behind, unhappy Gyges died;"
10153,THE ARGUMENT.,Then Phalaris is added to his side.
10154,THE ARGUMENT.,"The pointed jav’lins from the dead he drew,"
10155,THE ARGUMENT.,And their friends’ arms against their fellows threw.
10156,THE ARGUMENT.,Strong Halys stands in vain; weak Phlegys flies;
10157,THE ARGUMENT.,"Saturnia, still at hand, new force and fire supplies."
10158,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Halius, Prytanis, Alcander fall—"
10159,THE ARGUMENT.,Engag’d against the foes who scal’d the wall:
10160,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, whom they fear’d without, they found within."
10161,THE ARGUMENT.,"At last, tho’ late, by Lynceus he was seen."
10162,THE ARGUMENT.,"He calls new succours, and assaults the prince:"
10163,THE ARGUMENT.,"But weak his force, and vain is their defence."
10164,THE ARGUMENT.,"Turn’d to the right, his sword the hero drew,"
10165,THE ARGUMENT.,And at one blow the bold aggressor slew.
10166,THE ARGUMENT.,"He joints the neck; and, with a stroke so strong,"
10167,THE ARGUMENT.,"The helm flies off, and bears the head along."
10168,THE ARGUMENT.,"Next him, the huntsman Amycus he kill’d,"
10169,THE ARGUMENT.,In darts envenom’d and in poison skill’d.
10170,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Clytius fell beneath his fatal spear,"
10171,THE ARGUMENT.,"And Creteus, whom the Muses held so dear:"
10172,THE ARGUMENT.,"He fought with courage, and he sung the fight;"
10173,THE ARGUMENT.,"Arms were his bus’ness, verses his delight."
10174,THE ARGUMENT.,

10179,THE ARGUMENT.,"To save the living, and revenge the dead,"
10180,THE ARGUMENT.,Against one warrior’s arms all Troy they led.
10181,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O, void of sense and courage!” Mnestheus cried,"
10182,THE ARGUMENT.,“Where can you hope your coward heads to hide?
10183,THE ARGUMENT.,Ah! where beyond these rampires can you run?
10184,THE ARGUMENT.,"One man, and in your camp inclos’d, you shun!"
10185,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shall then a single sword such slaughter boast,"
10186,THE ARGUMENT.,And pass unpunish’d from a num’rous host?
10187,THE ARGUMENT.,"Forsaking honour, and renouncing fame,"
10188,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your gods, your country, and your king you shame!”"
10189,THE ARGUMENT.,This just reproach their virtue does excite:
10190,THE ARGUMENT.,"They stand, they join, they thicken to the fight."
10191,THE ARGUMENT.,
10192,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now Turnus doubts, and yet disdains to yield,"
10193,THE ARGUMENT.,"But with slow paces measures back the field,"
10194,THE ARGUMENT.,"And inches to the walls, where Tiber’s tide,"
10195,THE ARGUMENT.,"Washing the camp, defends the weaker side."
10196,THE ARGUMENT.,"The more he loses, they advance the more,"
10197,THE ARGUMENT.,And tread in ev’ry step he trod before.
10198,THE ARGUMENT.,"They shout: they bear him back; and, whom by might"
10199,THE ARGUMENT.,"They cannot conquer, they oppress with weight."
10200,THE ARGUMENT.,
10201,THE ARGUMENT.,"As, compass’d with a wood of spears around,"
10202,THE ARGUMENT.,The lordly lion still maintains his ground;
10203,THE ARGUMENT.,"Grins horrible, retires, and turns again;"
10204,THE ARGUMENT.,"Threats his distended paws, and shakes his mane;"
10205,THE ARGUMENT.,"He loses while in vain he presses on,"
10206,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor will his courage let him dare to run:

10208,THE ARGUMENT.,"Moves tardy back, and just recedes from fight."
10209,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet twice, enrag’d, the combat he renews,"
10210,THE ARGUMENT.,"Twice breaks, and twice his broken foes pursues."
10211,THE ARGUMENT.,"But now they swarm, and, with fresh troops supplied,"
10212,THE ARGUMENT.,"Come rolling on, and rush from ev’ry side:"
10213,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor Juno, who sustain’d his arms before,"
10214,THE ARGUMENT.,Dares with new strength suffice th’ exhausted store;
10215,THE ARGUMENT.,"For Jove, with sour commands, sent Iris down,"
10216,THE ARGUMENT.,To force th’ invader from the frighted town.
10217,THE ARGUMENT.,
10218,THE ARGUMENT.,"With labour spent, no longer can he wield"

10226,THE ARGUMENT.,
10227,THE ARGUMENT.,"The foe, now faint, the Trojans overwhelm;"
10228,THE ARGUMENT.,And Mnestheus lays hard load upon his helm.
10229,THE ARGUMENT.,Sick sweat succeeds; he drops at ev’ry pore;
10230,THE ARGUMENT.,With driving dust his cheeks are pasted o’er;
10231,THE ARGUMENT.,Shorter and shorter ev’ry gasp he takes;
10232,THE ARGUMENT.,And vain efforts and hurtless blows he makes.
10233,THE ARGUMENT.,"Plung’d in the flood, and made the waters fly."
10234,THE ARGUMENT.,"The yellow god the welcome burthen bore,"
10235,THE ARGUMENT.,"And wip’d the sweat, and wash’d away the gore;"

10244,THE ARGUMENT.,
10245,THE ARGUMENT.,
10246,THE ARGUMENT.,"Jupiter, calling a council of the gods, forbids them to engage in"
10247,THE ARGUMENT.,either party. At Aeneas’ return there is a bloody battle: Turnus
10248,THE ARGUMENT.,"killing Pallas; Aeneas, Lausus, and Mezentius. Mezentius is"
10249,THE ARGUMENT.,described as an atheist; Lausus as a pious and virtuous youth.
10250,THE ARGUMENT.,The different actions and death of these two are the subject of a
10251,THE ARGUMENT.,noble episode.
10252,THE ARGUMENT.,
10253,THE ARGUMENT.,
10254,THE ARGUMENT.,The gates of heav’n unfold: Jove summons all
10255,THE ARGUMENT.,The gods to council in the common hall.
10256,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sublimely seated, he surveys from far"
10257,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fields, the camp, the fortune of the war,"
10258,THE ARGUMENT.,"And all th’ inferior world. From first to last,"
10259,THE ARGUMENT.,The sov’reign senate in degrees are plac’d.
10260,THE ARGUMENT.,
10261,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then thus th’ almighty sire began: “Ye gods,"
10262,THE ARGUMENT.,"Natives or denizens of blest abodes,"
10263,THE ARGUMENT.,"From whence these murmurs, and this change of mind,"
10264,THE ARGUMENT.,This backward fate from what was first design’d?
10265,THE ARGUMENT.,"Why this protracted war, when my commands"
10266,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pronounc’d a peace, and gave the Latian lands?"
10267,THE ARGUMENT.,What fear or hope on either part divides
10268,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our heav’ns, and arms our powers on diff’rent sides?"
10269,THE ARGUMENT.,"A lawful time of war at length will come,"
10270,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Nor need your haste anticipate the doom),"
10271,THE ARGUMENT.,"When Carthage shall contend the world with Rome,"
10272,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shall force the rigid rocks and Alpine chains,"
10273,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, like a flood, come pouring on the plains."
10274,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then is your time for faction and debate,"
10275,THE ARGUMENT.,"For partial favour, and permitted hate."
10276,THE ARGUMENT.,Let now your immature dissension cease;
10277,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sit quiet, and compose your souls to peace.”"
10278,THE ARGUMENT.,
10279,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus Jupiter in few unfolds the charge;
10280,THE ARGUMENT.,But lovely Venus thus replies at large:
10281,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O pow’r immense, eternal energy,"
10282,THE ARGUMENT.,(For to what else protection can we fly?)
10283,THE ARGUMENT.,"Seest thou the proud Rutulians, how they dare"
10284,THE ARGUMENT.,"In fields, unpunish’d, and insult my care?"
10285,THE ARGUMENT.,"How lofty Turnus vaunts amidst his train,"
10286,THE ARGUMENT.,"In shining arms, triumphant on the plain?"
10287,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ev’n in their lines and trenches they contend,"
10288,THE ARGUMENT.,And scarce their walls the Trojan troops defend:
10289,THE ARGUMENT.,"The town is fill’d with slaughter, and o’erfloats,"
10290,THE ARGUMENT.,"With a red deluge, their increasing moats."
10291,THE ARGUMENT.,"Aeneas, ignorant, and far from thence,"
10292,THE ARGUMENT.,"Has left a camp expos’d, without defence."
10293,THE ARGUMENT.,This endless outrage shall they still sustain?
10294,THE ARGUMENT.,Shall Troy renew’d be forc’d and fir’d again?
10295,THE ARGUMENT.,"A second siege my banish’d issue fears,"
10296,THE ARGUMENT.,And a new Diomede in arms appears.
10297,THE ARGUMENT.,One more audacious mortal will be found;
10298,THE ARGUMENT.,"And I, thy daughter, wait another wound."
10299,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet, if with fates averse, without thy leave,"
10300,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Latian lands my progeny receive,"
10301,THE ARGUMENT.,"Bear they the pains of violated law,"
10302,THE ARGUMENT.,And thy protection from their aid withdraw.
10303,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, if the gods their sure success foretell;"
10304,THE ARGUMENT.,"If those of heav’n consent with those of hell,"
10305,THE ARGUMENT.,To promise Italy; who dare debate
10306,THE ARGUMENT.,"The pow’r of Jove, or fix another fate?"
10307,THE ARGUMENT.,"What should I tell of tempests on the main,"
10308,THE ARGUMENT.,Of Aeolus usurping Neptune’s reign?
10309,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of Iris sent, with Bacchanalian heat"
10310,THE ARGUMENT.,"T’ inspire the matrons, and destroy the fleet?"
10311,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now Juno to the Stygian sky descends,"
10312,THE ARGUMENT.,"Solicits hell for aid, and arms the fiends."
10313,THE ARGUMENT.,That new example wanted yet above:
10314,THE ARGUMENT.,An act that well became the wife of Jove!
10315,THE ARGUMENT.,"Alecto, rais’d by her, with rage inflames"
10316,THE ARGUMENT.,The peaceful bosoms of the Latian dames.
10317,THE ARGUMENT.,Imperial sway no more exalts my mind;
10318,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Such hopes I had indeed, while Heav’n was kind;)"
10319,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now let my happier foes possess my place,"
10320,THE ARGUMENT.,Whom Jove prefers before the Trojan race;
10321,THE ARGUMENT.,"And conquer they, whom you with conquest grace."
10322,THE ARGUMENT.,"Since you can spare, from all your wide command,"
10323,THE ARGUMENT.,"No spot of earth, no hospitable land,"
10324,THE ARGUMENT.,Which may my wand’ring fugitives receive;
10325,THE ARGUMENT.,(Since haughty Juno will not give you leave;)
10326,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, father, (if I still may use that name,)"
10327,THE ARGUMENT.,"By ruin’d Troy, yet smoking from the flame,"
10328,THE ARGUMENT.,"I beg you, let Ascanius, by my care,"
10329,THE ARGUMENT.,"Be freed from danger, and dismiss’d the war:"
10330,THE ARGUMENT.,"Inglorious let him live, without a crown."
10331,THE ARGUMENT.,"The father may be cast on coasts unknown,"
10332,THE ARGUMENT.,Struggling with fate; but let me save the son.
10333,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mine is Cythera, mine the Cyprian tow’rs:"
10334,THE ARGUMENT.,"In those recesses, and those sacred bow’rs,"
10335,THE ARGUMENT.,Obscurely let him rest; his right resign
10336,THE ARGUMENT.,"To promis’d empire, and his Julian line."
10337,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Carthage may th’ Ausonian towns destroy,"
10338,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor fear the race of a rejected boy.
10339,THE ARGUMENT.,"What profits it my son to scape the fire,"
10340,THE ARGUMENT.,"Arm’d with his gods, and loaded with his sire;"
10341,THE ARGUMENT.,To pass the perils of the seas and wind;
10342,THE ARGUMENT.,"Evade the Greeks, and leave the war behind;"
10343,THE ARGUMENT.,"To reach th’ Italian shores; if, after all,"
10344,THE ARGUMENT.,Our second Pergamus is doom’d to fall?
10345,THE ARGUMENT.,"Much better had he curb’d his high desires,"
10346,THE ARGUMENT.,And hover’d o’er his ill-extinguish’d fires.
10347,THE ARGUMENT.,"To Simois’ banks the fugitives restore,"
10348,THE ARGUMENT.,"And give them back to war, and all the woes before.”"
10349,THE ARGUMENT.,
10350,THE ARGUMENT.,Deep indignation swell’d Saturnia’s heart:
10351,THE ARGUMENT.,"“And must I own,” she said, “my secret smart—"
10352,THE ARGUMENT.,"What with more decence were in silence kept,"
10353,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, but for this unjust reproach, had slept?"
10354,THE ARGUMENT.,"Did god or man your fav’rite son advise,"
10355,THE ARGUMENT.,With war unhop’d the Latians to surprise?
10356,THE ARGUMENT.,"By fate, you boast, and by the gods’ decree,"
10357,THE ARGUMENT.,He left his native land for Italy!
10358,THE ARGUMENT.,"Confess the truth; by mad Cassandra, more"
10359,THE ARGUMENT.,"Than Heav’n inspir’d, he sought a foreign shore!"
10360,THE ARGUMENT.,Did I persuade to trust his second Troy
10361,THE ARGUMENT.,"To the raw conduct of a beardless boy,"
10362,THE ARGUMENT.,"With walls unfinish’d, which himself forsakes,"
10363,THE ARGUMENT.,And thro’ the waves a wand’ring voyage takes?
10364,THE ARGUMENT.,When have I urg’d him meanly to demand
10365,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Tuscan aid, and arm a quiet land?"
10366,THE ARGUMENT.,"Did I or Iris give this mad advice,"
10367,THE ARGUMENT.,Or made the fool himself the fatal choice?
10368,THE ARGUMENT.,"You think it hard, the Latians should destroy"
10369,THE ARGUMENT.,"With swords your Trojans, and with fires your Troy!"
10370,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hard and unjust indeed, for men to draw"
10371,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their native air, nor take a foreign law!"
10372,THE ARGUMENT.,"That Turnus is permitted still to live,"
10373,THE ARGUMENT.,To whom his birth a god and goddess give!
10374,THE ARGUMENT.,But yet is just and lawful for your line
10375,THE ARGUMENT.,"To drive their fields, and force with fraud to join;"
10376,THE ARGUMENT.,"Realms, not your own, among your clans divide,"
10377,THE ARGUMENT.,And from the bridegroom tear the promis’d bride;
10378,THE ARGUMENT.,"Petition, while you public arms prepare;"
10379,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pretend a peace, and yet provoke a war!"
10380,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Twas giv’n to you, your darling son to shroud,"
10381,THE ARGUMENT.,"To draw the dastard from the fighting crowd,"
10382,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, for a man, obtend an empty cloud."
10383,THE ARGUMENT.,"From flaming fleets you turn’d the fire away,"
10384,THE ARGUMENT.,And chang’d the ships to daughters of the sea.
10385,THE ARGUMENT.,"But is my crime—the Queen of Heav’n offends,"
10386,THE ARGUMENT.,If she presume to save her suff’ring friends!
10387,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your son, not knowing what his foes decree,"
10388,THE ARGUMENT.,"You say, is absent: absent let him be."
10389,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yours is Cythera, yours the Cyprian tow’rs,"
10390,THE ARGUMENT.,"The soft recesses, and the sacred bow’rs."
10391,THE ARGUMENT.,"Why do you then these needless arms prepare,"
10392,THE ARGUMENT.,And thus provoke a people prone to war?
10393,THE ARGUMENT.,"Did I with fire the Trojan town deface,"
10394,THE ARGUMENT.,Or hinder from return your exil’d race?
10395,THE ARGUMENT.,"Was I the cause of mischief, or the man"
10396,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose lawless lust the fatal war began?
10397,THE ARGUMENT.,Think on whose faith th’ adult’rous youth relied;
10398,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who promis’d, who procur’d, the Spartan bride?"
10399,THE ARGUMENT.,"When all th’ united states of Greece combin’d,"
10400,THE ARGUMENT.,"To purge the world of the perfidious kind,"
10401,THE ARGUMENT.,Then was your time to fear the Trojan fate:
10402,THE ARGUMENT.,Your quarrels and complaints are now too late.”
10403,THE ARGUMENT.,
10404,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus Juno. Murmurs rise, with mix’d applause,"
10405,THE ARGUMENT.,Just as they favour or dislike the cause.
10406,THE ARGUMENT.,"So winds, when yet unfledg’d in woods they lie,"
10407,THE ARGUMENT.,"In whispers first their tender voices try,"
10408,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then issue on the main with bellowing rage,"
10409,THE ARGUMENT.,And storms to trembling mariners presage.
10410,THE ARGUMENT.,
10411,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then thus to both replied th’ imperial god,"
10412,THE ARGUMENT.,Who shakes heav’n’s axles with his awful nod.
10413,THE ARGUMENT.,"(When he begins, the silent senate stand"
10414,THE ARGUMENT.,"With rev’rence, list’ning to the dread command:"
10415,THE ARGUMENT.,The clouds dispel; the winds their breath restrain;
10416,THE ARGUMENT.,And the hush’d waves lie flatted on the main.)
10417,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Celestials, your attentive ears incline!"
10418,THE ARGUMENT.,"Since,” said the god, “the Trojans must not join"
10419,THE ARGUMENT.,In wish’d alliance with the Latian line;
10420,THE ARGUMENT.,Since endless jarrings and immortal hate
10421,THE ARGUMENT.,Tend but to discompose our happy state;
10422,THE ARGUMENT.,The war henceforward be resign’d to fate:
10423,THE ARGUMENT.,Each to his proper fortune stand or fall;
10424,THE ARGUMENT.,Equal and unconcern’d I look on all.
10425,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rutulians, Trojans, are the same to me;"
10426,THE ARGUMENT.,And both shall draw the lots their fates decree.
10427,THE ARGUMENT.,"Let these assault, if Fortune be their friend;"
10428,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, if she favours those, let those defend:"
10429,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Fates will find their way.” The Thund’rer said,"
10430,THE ARGUMENT.,"And shook the sacred honours of his head,"
10431,THE ARGUMENT.,"Attesting Styx, th’ inviolable flood,"
10432,THE ARGUMENT.,And the black regions of his brother god.
10433,THE ARGUMENT.,"Trembled the poles of heav’n, and earth confess’d the nod."
10434,THE ARGUMENT.,"This end the sessions had: the senate rise,"
10435,THE ARGUMENT.,And to his palace wait their sov’reign thro’ the skies.
10436,THE ARGUMENT.,
10437,THE ARGUMENT.,"Meantime, intent upon their siege, the foes"
10438,THE ARGUMENT.,Within their walls the Trojan host inclose:
10439,THE ARGUMENT.,"They wound, they kill, they watch at ev’ry gate;"
10440,THE ARGUMENT.,"Renew the fires, and urge their happy fate."
10441,THE ARGUMENT.,
10442,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ Aeneans wish in vain their wanted chief,"
10443,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hopeless of flight, more hopeless of relief."
10444,THE ARGUMENT.,Thin on the tow’rs they stand; and ev’n those few
10445,THE ARGUMENT.,"A feeble, fainting, and dejected crew."
10446,THE ARGUMENT.,Yet in the face of danger some there stood:
10447,THE ARGUMENT.,"The two bold brothers of Sarpedon’s blood,"
10448,THE ARGUMENT.,Asius and Acmon; both th’ Assaraci;
10449,THE ARGUMENT.,"Young Haemon, and tho’ young, resolv’d to die."
10450,THE ARGUMENT.,With these were Clarus and Thymoetes join’d;
10451,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tibris and Castor, both of Lycian kind."
10452,THE ARGUMENT.,"From Acmon’s hands a rolling stone there came,"
10453,THE ARGUMENT.,"So large, it half deserv’d a mountain’s name:"
10454,THE ARGUMENT.,"Strong-sinew’d was the youth, and big of bone;"
10455,THE ARGUMENT.,"His brother Mnestheus could not more have done,"
10456,THE ARGUMENT.,Or the great father of th’ intrepid son.
10457,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some firebrands throw, some flights of arrows send;"
10458,THE ARGUMENT.,"And some with darts, and some with stones defend."
10459,THE ARGUMENT.,
10460,THE ARGUMENT.,"Amid the press appears the beauteous boy,"
10461,THE ARGUMENT.,"The care of Venus, and the hope of Troy."
10462,THE ARGUMENT.,"His lovely face unarm’d, his head was bare;"
10463,THE ARGUMENT.,In ringlets o’er his shoulders hung his hair.
10464,THE ARGUMENT.,His forehead circled with a diadem;
10465,THE ARGUMENT.,"Distinguish’d from the crowd, he shines a gem,"
10466,THE ARGUMENT.,"Enchas’d in gold, or polish’d iv’ry set,"
10467,THE ARGUMENT.,Amidst the meaner foil of sable jet.
10468,THE ARGUMENT.,
10469,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor Ismarus was wanting to the war,"
10470,THE ARGUMENT.,"Directing pointed arrows from afar,"
10471,THE ARGUMENT.,"And death with poison arm’d—in Lydia born,"
10472,THE ARGUMENT.,Where plenteous harvests the fat fields adorn;
10473,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where proud Pactolus floats the fruitful lands,"
10474,THE ARGUMENT.,And leaves a rich manure of golden sands.
10475,THE ARGUMENT.,"There Capys, author of the Capuan name,"
10476,THE ARGUMENT.,"And there was Mnestheus too, increas’d in fame,"
10477,THE ARGUMENT.,Since Turnus from the camp he cast with shame.
10478,THE ARGUMENT.,
10479,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus mortal war was wag’d on either side.
10480,THE ARGUMENT.,Meantime the hero cuts the nightly tide:
10481,THE ARGUMENT.,"For, anxious, from Evander when he went,"
10482,THE ARGUMENT.,"He sought the Tyrrhene camp, and Tarchon’s tent;"
10483,THE ARGUMENT.,Expos’d the cause of coming to the chief;
10484,THE ARGUMENT.,"His name and country told, and ask’d relief;"
10485,THE ARGUMENT.,Propos’d the terms; his own small strength declar’d;
10486,THE ARGUMENT.,What vengeance proud Mezentius had prepar’d:
10487,THE ARGUMENT.,"What Turnus, bold and violent, design’d;"
10488,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then shew’d the slipp’ry state of humankind,"
10489,THE ARGUMENT.,"And fickle fortune; warn’d him to beware,"
10490,THE ARGUMENT.,And to his wholesome counsel added pray’r.
10491,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tarchon, without delay, the treaty signs,"
10492,THE ARGUMENT.,And to the Trojan troops the Tuscan joins.
10493,THE ARGUMENT.,
10494,THE ARGUMENT.,They soon set sail; nor now the fates withstand;
10495,THE ARGUMENT.,Their forces trusted with a foreign hand.
10496,THE ARGUMENT.,Aeneas leads; upon his stern appear
10497,THE ARGUMENT.,"Two lions carv’d, which rising Ida bear—"
10498,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ida, to wand’ring Trojans ever dear."
10499,THE ARGUMENT.,"Under their grateful shade Aeneas sate,"
10500,THE ARGUMENT.,"Revolving war’s events, and various fate."
10501,THE ARGUMENT.,"His left young Pallas kept, fix’d to his side,"
10502,THE ARGUMENT.,"And oft of winds enquir’d, and of the tide;"
10503,THE ARGUMENT.,"Oft of the stars, and of their wat’ry way;"
10504,THE ARGUMENT.,And what he suffer’d both by land and sea.
10505,THE ARGUMENT.,
10506,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, sacred sisters, open all your spring!"
10507,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Tuscan leaders, and their army sing,"
10508,THE ARGUMENT.,Which follow’d great Aeneas to the war:

10522,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who heav’n interprets, and the wand’ring stars;"

10526,THE ARGUMENT.,Sent by the Pisans under his command.

10533,THE ARGUMENT.,"All bred in arms, unanimous, and brave."
10534,THE ARGUMENT.,
10535,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thou, Muse, the name of Cinyras renew,"
10536,THE ARGUMENT.,And brave Cupavo follow’d but by few;

10538,THE ARGUMENT.,"And bore, with wings display’d, a silver swan."
10539,THE ARGUMENT.,"Love was the fault of his fam’d ancestry,"
10540,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose forms and fortunes in his ensigns fly.
10541,THE ARGUMENT.,"For Cycnus lov’d unhappy Phaeton,"
10542,THE ARGUMENT.,"And sung his loss in poplar groves, alone,"
10543,THE ARGUMENT.,"Beneath the sister shades, to soothe his grief."
10544,THE ARGUMENT.,"Heav’n heard his song, and hasten’d his relief,"
10545,THE ARGUMENT.,"And chang’d to snowy plumes his hoary hair,"
10546,THE ARGUMENT.,"And wing’d his flight, to chant aloft in air."
10547,THE ARGUMENT.,His son Cupavo brush’d the briny flood:
10548,THE ARGUMENT.,"Upon his stern a brawny Centaur stood,"
10549,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who heav’d a rock, and, threat’ning still to throw,"
10550,THE ARGUMENT.,With lifted hands alarm’d the seas below:
10551,THE ARGUMENT.,"They seem’d to fear the formidable sight,"
10552,THE ARGUMENT.,"And roll’d their billows on, to speed his flight."
10553,THE ARGUMENT.,
10554,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ocnus was next, who led his native train"
10555,THE ARGUMENT.,Of hardy warriors thro’ the wat’ry plain:
10556,THE ARGUMENT.,"The son of Manto by the Tuscan stream,"

10559,THE ARGUMENT.,Three sev’ral tribes compose the government;
10560,THE ARGUMENT.,Four towns are under each; but all obey
10561,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Mantuan laws, and own the Tuscan sway."
10562,THE ARGUMENT.,
10563,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hate to Mezentius arm’d five hundred more,"

10566,THE ARGUMENT.,These grave Auletes leads: a hundred sweep
10567,THE ARGUMENT.,With stretching oars at once the glassy deep.
10568,THE ARGUMENT.,Him and his martial train the Triton bears;
10569,THE ARGUMENT.,High on his poop the sea-green god appears:
10570,THE ARGUMENT.,"Frowning he seems his crooked shell to sound,"
10571,THE ARGUMENT.,And at the blast the billows dance around.
10572,THE ARGUMENT.,A hairy man above the waist he shows;
10573,THE ARGUMENT.,A porpoise tail beneath his belly grows;
10574,THE ARGUMENT.,"And ends a fish: his breast the waves divides,"

10597,THE ARGUMENT.,"Spread ev’ry sail, pursue your wat’ry track,"
10598,THE ARGUMENT.,"And haste your course. Your navy once were we,"
10599,THE ARGUMENT.,From Ida’s height descending to the sea;
10600,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till Turnus, as at anchor fix’d we stood,"
10601,THE ARGUMENT.,Presum’d to violate our holy wood.
10602,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, loos’d from shore, we fled his fires profane"
10603,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Unwillingly we broke our master’s chain),"
10604,THE ARGUMENT.,And since have sought you thro’ the Tuscan main.
10605,THE ARGUMENT.,"The mighty Mother chang’d our forms to these,"

10607,THE ARGUMENT.,"But young Ascanius, in his camp distress’d,"
10608,THE ARGUMENT.,By your insulting foes is hardly press’d.
10609,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ Arcadian horsemen, and Etrurian host,"
10610,THE ARGUMENT.,Advance in order on the Latian coast:
10611,THE ARGUMENT.,"To cut their way the Daunian chief designs,"
10612,THE ARGUMENT.,Before their troops can reach the Trojan lines.
10613,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thou, when the rosy morn restores the light,"
10614,THE ARGUMENT.,First arm thy soldiers for th’ ensuing fight:
10615,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thyself the fated sword of Vulcan wield,"
10616,THE ARGUMENT.,And bear aloft th’ impenetrable shield.
10617,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tomorrow’s sun, unless my skill be vain,"
10618,THE ARGUMENT.,Shall see huge heaps of foes in battle slain.”
10619,THE ARGUMENT.,"Parting, she spoke; and with immortal force"
10620,THE ARGUMENT.,Push’d on the vessel in her wat’ry course;
10621,THE ARGUMENT.,"For well she knew the way. Impell’d behind,"
10622,THE ARGUMENT.,"The ship flew forward, and outstripp’d the wind."
10623,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rest make up. Unknowing of the cause,"
10624,THE ARGUMENT.,"The chief admires their speed, and happy omens draws."
10625,THE ARGUMENT.,
10626,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then thus he pray’d, and fix’d on heav’n his eyes:"
10627,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Hear thou, great Mother of the deities."
10628,THE ARGUMENT.,With turrets crown’d! (on Ida’s holy hill
10629,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fierce tigers, rein’d and curb’d, obey thy will.)"
10630,THE ARGUMENT.,Firm thy own omens; lead us on to fight;
10631,THE ARGUMENT.,And let thy Phrygians conquer in thy right.”
10632,THE ARGUMENT.,
10633,THE ARGUMENT.,He said no more. And now renewing day
10634,THE ARGUMENT.,Had chas’d the shadows of the night away.
10635,THE ARGUMENT.,"He charg’d the soldiers, with preventing care,"
10636,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their flags to follow, and their arms prepare;"
10637,THE ARGUMENT.,"Warn’d of th’ ensuing fight, and bade ’em hope the war."
10638,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, his lofty poop, he view’d below"
10639,THE ARGUMENT.,"His camp incompass’d, and th’ inclosing foe."
10640,THE ARGUMENT.,"His blazing shield, imbrac’d, he held on high;"
10641,THE ARGUMENT.,"The camp receive the sign, and with loud shouts reply."
10642,THE ARGUMENT.,Hope arms their courage: from their tow’rs they throw
10643,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their darts with double force, and drive the foe."
10644,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus, at the signal giv’n, the cranes arise"
10645,THE ARGUMENT.,"Before the stormy south, and blacken all the skies."
10646,THE ARGUMENT.,
10647,THE ARGUMENT.,"King Turnus wonder’d at the fight renew’d,"
10648,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till, looking back, the Trojan fleet he view’d,"
10649,THE ARGUMENT.,"The seas with swelling canvas cover’d o’er,"
10650,THE ARGUMENT.,And the swift ships descending on the shore.
10651,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Latians saw from far, with dazzled eyes,"
10652,THE ARGUMENT.,"The radiant crest that seem’d in flames to rise,"
10653,THE ARGUMENT.,"And dart diffusive fires around the field,"
10654,THE ARGUMENT.,And the keen glitt’ring of the golden shield.
10655,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus threat’ning comets, when by night they rise,"
10656,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shoot sanguine streams, and sadden all the skies:"
10657,THE ARGUMENT.,"So Sirius, flashing forth sinister lights,"
10658,THE ARGUMENT.,Pale humankind with plagues and with dry famine fright:
10659,THE ARGUMENT.,
10660,THE ARGUMENT.,Yet Turnus with undaunted mind is bent
10661,THE ARGUMENT.,"To man the shores, and hinder their descent,"
10662,THE ARGUMENT.,And thus awakes the courage of his friends:
10663,THE ARGUMENT.,"“What you so long have wish’d, kind Fortune sends;"
10664,THE ARGUMENT.,In ardent arms to meet th’ invading foe:
10665,THE ARGUMENT.,"You find, and find him at advantage now."
10666,THE ARGUMENT.,Yours is the day: you need but only dare;
10667,THE ARGUMENT.,Your swords will make you masters of the war.
10668,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your sires, your sons, your houses, and your lands,"
10669,THE ARGUMENT.,"And dearest wifes, are all within your hands."
10670,THE ARGUMENT.,"Be mindful of the race from whence you came,"
10671,THE ARGUMENT.,And emulate in arms your fathers’ fame.
10672,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now take the time, while stagg’ring yet they stand"
10673,THE ARGUMENT.,"With feet unfirm, and prepossess the strand:"
10674,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fortune befriends the bold.” Nor more he said,"
10675,THE ARGUMENT.,"But balanc’d whom to leave, and whom to lead;"
10676,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then these elects, the landing to prevent;"
10677,THE ARGUMENT.,"And those he leaves, to keep the city pent."
10678,THE ARGUMENT.,
10679,THE ARGUMENT.,Meantime the Trojan sends his troops ashore:
10680,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some are by boats expos’d, by bridges more."
10681,THE ARGUMENT.,"With lab’ring oars they bear along the strand,"
10682,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where the tide languishes, and leap a-land."
10683,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tarchon observes the coast with careful eyes,"
10684,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, where no ford he finds, no water fries,"
10685,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor billows with unequal murmurs roar,"
10686,THE ARGUMENT.,"But smoothly slide along, and swell the shore,"
10687,THE ARGUMENT.,"That course he steer’d, and thus he gave command:"
10688,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Here ply your oars, and at all hazard land:"
10689,THE ARGUMENT.,"Force on the vessel, that her keel may wound"
10690,THE ARGUMENT.,"This hated soil, and furrow hostile ground."
10691,THE ARGUMENT.,Let me securely land—I ask no more;
10692,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then sink my ships, or shatter on the shore.”"
10693,THE ARGUMENT.,
10694,THE ARGUMENT.,This fiery speech inflames his fearful friends:
10695,THE ARGUMENT.,"They tug at ev’ry oar, and ev’ry stretcher bends;"
10696,THE ARGUMENT.,"They run their ships aground; the vessels knock,"
10697,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Thus forc’d ashore,) and tremble with the shock."
10698,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tarchon’s alone was lost, that stranded stood,"
10699,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stuck on a bank, and beaten by the flood:"
10700,THE ARGUMENT.,"She breaks her back; the loosen’d sides give way,"
10701,THE ARGUMENT.,And plunge the Tuscan soldiers in the sea.
10702,THE ARGUMENT.,Their broken oars and floating planks withstand
10703,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their passage, while they labour to the land,"
10704,THE ARGUMENT.,And ebbing tides bear back upon th’ uncertain sand.
10705,THE ARGUMENT.,
10706,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now Turnus leads his troops without delay,"
10707,THE ARGUMENT.,Advancing to the margin of the sea.
10708,THE ARGUMENT.,The trumpets sound: Aeneas first assail’d
10709,THE ARGUMENT.,"The clowns new-rais’d and raw, and soon prevail’d."
10710,THE ARGUMENT.,"Great Theron fell, an omen of the fight;"
10711,THE ARGUMENT.,"Great Theron, large of limbs, of giant height."
10712,THE ARGUMENT.,He first in open field defied the prince:
10713,THE ARGUMENT.,But armour scal’d with gold was no defence
10714,THE ARGUMENT.,"Against the fated sword, which open’d wide"
10715,THE ARGUMENT.,"His plated shield, and pierc’d his naked side."
10716,THE ARGUMENT.,"Next, Lichas fell, who, not like others born,"
10717,THE ARGUMENT.,Was from his wretched mother ripp’d and torn;
10718,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sacred, O Phoebus, from his birth to thee;"
10719,THE ARGUMENT.,For his beginning life from biting steel was free.
10720,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not far from him was Gyas laid along,"
10721,THE ARGUMENT.,Of monstrous bulk; with Cisseus fierce and strong:
10722,THE ARGUMENT.,"Vain bulk and strength! for, when the chief assail’d,"
10723,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor valour nor Herculean arms avail’d,"
10724,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor their fam’d father, wont in war to go"
10725,THE ARGUMENT.,"With great Alcides, while he toil’d below."
10726,THE ARGUMENT.,The noisy Pharos next receiv’d his death:
10727,THE ARGUMENT.,"Aeneas writh’d his dart, and stopp’d his bawling breath."
10728,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then wretched Cydon had receiv’d his doom,"
10729,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who courted Clytius in his beardless bloom,"
10730,THE ARGUMENT.,And sought with lust obscene polluted joys:
10731,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojan sword had curd his love of boys,"
10732,THE ARGUMENT.,Had not his sev’n bold brethren stopp’d the course
10733,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of the fierce champions, with united force."
10734,THE ARGUMENT.,Sev’n darts were thrown at once; and some rebound
10735,THE ARGUMENT.,"From his bright shield, some on his helmet sound:"
10736,THE ARGUMENT.,The rest had reach’d him; but his mother’s care
10737,THE ARGUMENT.,"Prevented those, and turn’d aside in air."
10738,THE ARGUMENT.,
10739,THE ARGUMENT.,"The prince then call’d Achates, to supply"
10740,THE ARGUMENT.,The spears that knew the way to victory—
10741,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Those fatal weapons, which, inur’d to blood,"
10742,THE ARGUMENT.,In Grecian bodies under Ilium stood:
10743,THE ARGUMENT.,Not one of those my hand shall toss in vain
10744,THE ARGUMENT.,"Against our foes, on this contended plain.”"
10745,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said; then seiz’d a mighty spear, and threw;"
10746,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which, wing’d with fate, thro’ Maeon’s buckler flew,"
10747,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pierc’d all the brazen plates, and reach’d his heart:"
10748,THE ARGUMENT.,He stagger’d with intolerable smart.
10749,THE ARGUMENT.,"Alcanor saw; and reach’d, but reach’d in vain,"
10750,THE ARGUMENT.,"His helping hand, his brother to sustain."
10751,THE ARGUMENT.,"A second spear, which kept the former course,"
10752,THE ARGUMENT.,"From the same hand, and sent with equal force,"
10753,THE ARGUMENT.,"His right arm pierc’d, and holding on, bereft"
10754,THE ARGUMENT.,"His use of both, and pinion’d down his left."
10755,THE ARGUMENT.,Then Numitor from his dead brother drew
10756,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ ill-omen’d spear, and at the Trojan threw:"
10757,THE ARGUMENT.,"Preventing fate directs the lance awry,"
10758,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which, glancing, only mark’d Achates’ thigh."
10759,THE ARGUMENT.,
10760,THE ARGUMENT.,"In pride of youth the Sabine Clausus came,"
10761,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, from afar, at Dryops took his aim."
10762,THE ARGUMENT.,"The spear flew hissing thro’ the middle space,"
10763,THE ARGUMENT.,"And pierc’d his throat, directed at his face;"
10764,THE ARGUMENT.,"It stopp’d at once the passage of his wind,"
10765,THE ARGUMENT.,And the free soul to flitting air resign’d:
10766,THE ARGUMENT.,His forehead was the first that struck the ground;
10767,THE ARGUMENT.,Lifeblood and life rush’d mingled thro’ the wound.
10768,THE ARGUMENT.,"He slew three brothers of the Borean race,"
10769,THE ARGUMENT.,"And three, whom Ismarus, their native place,"
10770,THE ARGUMENT.,"Had sent to war, but all the sons of Thrace."
10771,THE ARGUMENT.,"Halesus, next, the bold Aurunci leads:"
10772,THE ARGUMENT.,"The son of Neptune to his aid succeeds,"
10773,THE ARGUMENT.,"Conspicuous on his horse. On either hand,"
10774,THE ARGUMENT.,"These fight to keep, and those to win, the land."
10775,THE ARGUMENT.,"With mutual blood th’ Ausonian soil is dyed,"
10776,THE ARGUMENT.,While on its borders each their claim decide.
10777,THE ARGUMENT.,"As wintry winds, contending in the sky,"
10778,THE ARGUMENT.,With equal force of lungs their titles try:
10779,THE ARGUMENT.,"They rage, they roar; the doubtful rack of heav’n"
10780,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stands without motion, and the tide undriv’n:"
10781,THE ARGUMENT.,"Each bent to conquer, neither side to yield,"
10782,THE ARGUMENT.,They long suspend the fortune of the field.
10783,THE ARGUMENT.,Both armies thus perform what courage can;
10784,THE ARGUMENT.,"Foot set to foot, and mingled man to man."
10785,THE ARGUMENT.,
10786,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, in another part, th’ Arcadian horse"
10787,THE ARGUMENT.,With ill success engage the Latin force:
10788,THE ARGUMENT.,"For, where th’ impetuous torrent, rushing down,"
10789,THE ARGUMENT.,"Huge craggy stones and rooted trees had thrown,"
10790,THE ARGUMENT.,"They left their coursers, and, unus’d to fight"
10791,THE ARGUMENT.,"On foot, were scatter’d in a shameful flight."
10792,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pallas, who with disdain and grief had view’d"
10793,THE ARGUMENT.,"His foes pursuing, and his friends pursued,"
10794,THE ARGUMENT.,"Us’d threat’nings mix’d with pray’rs, his last resource,"
10795,THE ARGUMENT.,"With these to move their minds, with those to fire their force"
10796,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Which way, companions? whether would you run?"
10797,THE ARGUMENT.,"By you yourselves, and mighty battles won,"
10798,THE ARGUMENT.,"By my great sire, by his establish’d name,"
10799,THE ARGUMENT.,And early promise of my future fame;
10800,THE ARGUMENT.,"By my youth, emulous of equal right"
10801,THE ARGUMENT.,To share his honours—shun ignoble flight!
10802,THE ARGUMENT.,Trust not your feet: your hands must hew way
10803,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thro’ yon black body, and that thick array:"
10804,THE ARGUMENT.,’Tis thro’ that forward path that we must come;
10805,THE ARGUMENT.,"There lies our way, and that our passage home."
10806,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor pow’rs above, nor destinies below"
10807,THE ARGUMENT.,"Oppress our arms: with equal strength we go,"
10808,THE ARGUMENT.,With mortal hands to meet a mortal foe.
10809,THE ARGUMENT.,"See on what foot we stand: a scanty shore,"
10810,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sea behind, our enemies before;"
10811,THE ARGUMENT.,"No passage left, unless we swim the main;"
10812,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or, forcing these, the Trojan trenches gain.”"
10813,THE ARGUMENT.,"This said, he strode with eager haste along,"
10814,THE ARGUMENT.,And bore amidst the thickest of the throng.
10815,THE ARGUMENT.,"Lagus, the first he met, with fate to foe,"
10816,THE ARGUMENT.,"Had heav’d a stone of mighty weight, to throw:"
10817,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stooping, the spear descended on his chine,"
10818,THE ARGUMENT.,Just where the bone distinguished either loin:
10819,THE ARGUMENT.,"It stuck so fast, so deeply buried lay,"
10820,THE ARGUMENT.,That scarce the victor forc’d the steel away.
10821,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hisbon came on: but, while he mov’d too slow"
10822,THE ARGUMENT.,"To wish’d revenge, the prince prevents his blow;"
10823,THE ARGUMENT.,"For, warding his at once, at once he press’d,"
10824,THE ARGUMENT.,And plung’d the fatal weapon in his breast.
10825,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then lewd Anchemolus he laid in dust,"
10826,THE ARGUMENT.,Who stain’d his stepdam’s bed with impious lust.
10827,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, after him, the Daucian twins were slain,"
10828,THE ARGUMENT.,"Laris and Thymbrus, on the Latian plain;"
10829,THE ARGUMENT.,"So wondrous like in feature, shape, and size,"
10830,THE ARGUMENT.,As caus’d an error in their parents’ eyes—
10831,THE ARGUMENT.,Grateful mistake! but soon the sword decides
10832,THE ARGUMENT.,"The nice distinction, and their fate divides:"
10833,THE ARGUMENT.,"For Thymbrus’ head was lopp’d; and Laris’ hand,"
10834,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dismember’d, sought its owner on the strand:"
10835,THE ARGUMENT.,"The trembling fingers yet the falchion strain,"
10836,THE ARGUMENT.,And threaten still th’ intended stroke in vain.
10837,THE ARGUMENT.,
10838,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, to renew the charge, th’ Arcadians came:"
10839,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sight of such acts, and sense of honest shame,"
10840,THE ARGUMENT.,"And grief, with anger mix’d, their minds inflame."
10841,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, with a casual blow was Rhoeteus slain,"
10842,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who chanc’d, as Pallas threw, to cross the plain:"
10843,THE ARGUMENT.,The flying spear was after Ilus sent;
10844,THE ARGUMENT.,But Rhoeteus happen’d on a death unmeant:
10845,THE ARGUMENT.,"From Teuthras and from Tyres while he fled,"
10846,THE ARGUMENT.,"The lance, athwart his body, laid him dead:"
10847,THE ARGUMENT.,"Roll’d from his chariot with a mortal wound,"
10848,THE ARGUMENT.,"And intercepted fate, he spurn’d the ground."
10849,THE ARGUMENT.,"As when, in summer, welcome winds arise,"
10850,THE ARGUMENT.,"The watchful shepherd to the forest flies,"
10851,THE ARGUMENT.,"And fires the midmost plants; contagion spreads,"
10852,THE ARGUMENT.,And catching flames infect the neighb’ring heads;
10853,THE ARGUMENT.,"Around the forest flies the furious blast,"
10854,THE ARGUMENT.,"And all the leafy nation sinks at last,"
10855,THE ARGUMENT.,And Vulcan rides in triumph o’er the waste;
10856,THE ARGUMENT.,"The pastor, pleas’d with his dire victory,"
10857,THE ARGUMENT.,Beholds the satiate flames in sheets ascend the sky:
10858,THE ARGUMENT.,"So Pallas’ troops their scatter’d strength unite,"
10859,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, pouring on their foes, their prince delight."
10860,THE ARGUMENT.,
10861,THE ARGUMENT.,"Halesus came, fierce with desire of blood;"
10862,THE ARGUMENT.,But first collected in his arms he stood:
10863,THE ARGUMENT.,"Advancing then, he plied the spear so well,"
10864,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ladon, Demodocus, and Pheres fell."
10865,THE ARGUMENT.,"Around his head he toss’d his glitt’ring brand,"
10866,THE ARGUMENT.,"And from Strymonius hew’d his better hand,"
10867,THE ARGUMENT.,Held up to guard his throat; then hurl’d a stone
10868,THE ARGUMENT.,"At Thoas’ ample front, and pierc’d the bone:"
10869,THE ARGUMENT.,It struck beneath the space of either eye;
10870,THE ARGUMENT.,"And blood, and mingled brains, together fly."
10871,THE ARGUMENT.,"Deep skill’d in future fates, Halesus’ sire"
10872,THE ARGUMENT.,Did with the youth to lonely groves retire:
10873,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, when the father’s mortal race was run,"
10874,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dire destiny laid hold upon the son,"
10875,THE ARGUMENT.,"And haul’d him to the war, to find, beneath"
10876,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ Evandrian spear, a memorable death."
10877,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pallas th’ encounter seeks, but, ere he throws,"
10878,THE ARGUMENT.,To Tuscan Tiber thus address’d his vows:
10879,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O sacred stream, direct my flying dart,"
10880,THE ARGUMENT.,And give to pass the proud Halesus’ heart!
10881,THE ARGUMENT.,His arms and spoils thy holy oak shall bear.”
10882,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pleas’d with the bribe, the god receiv’d his pray’r:"
10883,THE ARGUMENT.,"For, while his shield protects a friend distress’d,"
10884,THE ARGUMENT.,"The dart came driving on, and pierc’d his breast."
10885,THE ARGUMENT.,
10886,THE ARGUMENT.,"But Lausus, no small portion of the war,"
10887,THE ARGUMENT.,"Permits not panic fear to reign too far,"
10888,THE ARGUMENT.,Caus’d by the death of so renown’d a knight;
10889,THE ARGUMENT.,But by his own example cheers the fight.
10890,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fierce Abas first he slew; Abas, the stay"
10891,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of Trojan hopes, and hindrance of the day."
10892,THE ARGUMENT.,The Phrygian troops escap’d the Greeks in vain:
10893,THE ARGUMENT.,"They, and their mix’d allies, now load the plain."
10894,THE ARGUMENT.,To the rude shock of war both armies came;
10895,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their leaders equal, and their strength the same."
10896,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rear so press’d the front, they could not wield"
10897,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their angry weapons, to dispute the field."
10898,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here Pallas urges on, and Lausus there:"
10899,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of equal youth and beauty both appear,"
10900,THE ARGUMENT.,But both by fate forbid to breathe their native air.
10901,THE ARGUMENT.,Their congress in the field great Jove withstands:
10902,THE ARGUMENT.,"Both doom’d to fall, but fall by greater hands."
10903,THE ARGUMENT.,
10904,THE ARGUMENT.,Meantime Juturna warns the Daunian chief
10905,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of Lausus’ danger, urging swift relief."
10906,THE ARGUMENT.,"With his driv’n chariot he divides the crowd,"
10907,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, making to his friends, thus calls aloud:"
10908,THE ARGUMENT.,“Let none presume his needless aid to join;
10909,THE ARGUMENT.,"Retire, and clear the field; the fight is mine:"
10910,THE ARGUMENT.,To this right hand is Pallas only due;
10911,THE ARGUMENT.,"O were his father here, my just revenge to view!”"
10912,THE ARGUMENT.,From the forbidden space his men retir’d.
10913,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pallas their awe, and his stern words, admir’d;"
10914,THE ARGUMENT.,"Survey’d him o’er and o’er with wond’ring sight,"
10915,THE ARGUMENT.,"Struck with his haughty mien, and tow’ring height."
10916,THE ARGUMENT.,Then to the king: “Your empty vaunts forbear;
10917,THE ARGUMENT.,"Success I hope, and fate I cannot fear;"
10918,THE ARGUMENT.,"Alive or dead, I shall deserve a name;"
10919,THE ARGUMENT.,"Jove is impartial, and to both the same.”"
10920,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said, and to the void advanc’d his pace:"
10921,THE ARGUMENT.,Pale horror sate on each Arcadian face.
10922,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Turnus, from his chariot leaping light,"
10923,THE ARGUMENT.,Address’d himself on foot to single fight.
10924,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, as a lion—when he spies from far"
10925,THE ARGUMENT.,"A bull that seems to meditate the war,"
10926,THE ARGUMENT.,"Bending his neck, and spurning back the sand—"
10927,THE ARGUMENT.,Runs roaring downward from his hilly stand:
10928,THE ARGUMENT.,"Imagine eager Turnus not more slow,"
10929,THE ARGUMENT.,To rush from high on his unequal foe.
10930,THE ARGUMENT.,
10931,THE ARGUMENT.,"Young Pallas, when he saw the chief advance"
10932,THE ARGUMENT.,"Within due distance of his flying lance,"
10933,THE ARGUMENT.,"Prepares to charge him first, resolv’d to try"
10934,THE ARGUMENT.,If fortune would his want of force supply;
10935,THE ARGUMENT.,And thus to Heav’n and Hercules address’d:
10936,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Alcides, once on earth Evander’s guest,"
10937,THE ARGUMENT.,"His son adjures you by those holy rites,"
10938,THE ARGUMENT.,"That hospitable board, those genial nights;"
10939,THE ARGUMENT.,"Assist my great attempt to gain this prize,"
10940,THE ARGUMENT.,"And let proud Turnus view, with dying eyes,"
10941,THE ARGUMENT.,"His ravish’d spoils.” ’Twas heard, the vain request;"
10942,THE ARGUMENT.,"Alcides mourn’d, and stifled sighs within his breast."
10943,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Jove, to soothe his sorrow, thus began:"
10944,THE ARGUMENT.,“Short bounds of life are set to mortal man.
10945,THE ARGUMENT.,’Tis virtue’s work alone to stretch the narrow span.
10946,THE ARGUMENT.,"So many sons of gods, in bloody fight,"
10947,THE ARGUMENT.,"Around the walls of Troy, have lost the light:"
10948,THE ARGUMENT.,My own Sarpedon fell beneath his foe;
10949,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor I, his mighty sire, could ward the blow."
10950,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ev’n Turnus shortly shall resign his breath,"
10951,THE ARGUMENT.,And stands already on the verge of death.”
10952,THE ARGUMENT.,"This said, the god permits the fatal fight,"
10953,THE ARGUMENT.,But from the Latian fields averts his sight.
10954,THE ARGUMENT.,
10955,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now with full force his spear young Pallas threw,"
10956,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, having thrown, his shining falchion drew"
10957,THE ARGUMENT.,"The steel just graz’d along the shoulder joint,"
10958,THE ARGUMENT.,"And mark’d it slightly with the glancing point,"
10959,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fierce Turnus first to nearer distance drew,"
10960,THE ARGUMENT.,"And pois’d his pointed spear, before he threw:"
10961,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, as the winged weapon whizz’d along,"
10962,THE ARGUMENT.,"“See now,” said he, “whose arm is better strung.”"
10963,THE ARGUMENT.,"The spear kept on the fatal course, unstay’d"
10964,THE ARGUMENT.,"By plates of ir’n, which o’er the shield were laid:"
10965,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thro’ folded brass and tough bull hides it pass’d,"
10966,THE ARGUMENT.,"His corslet pierc’d, and reach’d his heart at last."
10967,THE ARGUMENT.,In vain the youth tugs at the broken wood;
10968,THE ARGUMENT.,The soul comes issuing with the vital blood:
10969,THE ARGUMENT.,He falls; his arms upon his body sound;
10970,THE ARGUMENT.,And with his bloody teeth he bites the ground.
10971,THE ARGUMENT.,
10972,THE ARGUMENT.,"Turnus bestrode the corpse: “Arcadians, hear,”"
10973,THE ARGUMENT.,Said he; “my message to your master bear:
10974,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such as the sire deserv’d, the son I send;"
10975,THE ARGUMENT.,It costs him dear to be the Phrygians’ friend.
10976,THE ARGUMENT.,"The lifeless body, tell him, I bestow,"
10977,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unask’d, to rest his wand’ring ghost below.”"
10978,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said, and trampled down with all the force"
10979,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of his left foot, and spurn’d the wretched corse;"
10980,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then snatch’d the shining belt, with gold inlaid;"
10981,THE ARGUMENT.,"The belt Eurytion’s artful hands had made,"
10982,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where fifty fatal brides, express’d to sight,"
10983,THE ARGUMENT.,"All in the compass of one mournful night,"
10984,THE ARGUMENT.,Depriv’d their bridegrooms of returning light.
10985,THE ARGUMENT.,
10986,THE ARGUMENT.,In an ill hour insulting Turnus tore
10987,THE ARGUMENT.,"Those golden spoils, and in a worse he wore."
10988,THE ARGUMENT.,"O mortals, blind in fate, who never know"
10989,THE ARGUMENT.,"To bear high fortune, or endure the low!"
10990,THE ARGUMENT.,"The time shall come, when Turnus, but in vain,"
10991,THE ARGUMENT.,Shall wish untouch’d the trophies of the slain;
10992,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shall wish the fatal belt were far away,"
10993,THE ARGUMENT.,And curse the dire remembrance of the day.
10994,THE ARGUMENT.,
10995,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sad Arcadians, from th’ unhappy field,"
10996,THE ARGUMENT.,Bear back the breathless body on a shield.
10997,THE ARGUMENT.,"O grace and grief of war! at once restor’d,"
10998,THE ARGUMENT.,"With praises, to thy sire, at once deplor’d!"
10999,THE ARGUMENT.,"One day first sent thee to the fighting field,"
11000,THE ARGUMENT.,Beheld whole heaps of foes in battle kill’d;
11001,THE ARGUMENT.,"One day beheld thee dead, and borne upon thy shield."
11002,THE ARGUMENT.,"This dismal news, not from uncertain fame,"
11003,THE ARGUMENT.,"But sad spectators, to the hero came:"
11004,THE ARGUMENT.,"His friends upon the brink of ruin stand,"
11005,THE ARGUMENT.,Unless reliev’d by his victorious hand.
11006,THE ARGUMENT.,"He whirls his sword around, without delay,"
11007,THE ARGUMENT.,"And hews thro’ adverse foes an ample way,"
11008,THE ARGUMENT.,"To find fierce Turnus, of his conquest proud:"
11009,THE ARGUMENT.,"Evander, Pallas, all that friendship ow’d"
11010,THE ARGUMENT.,"To large deserts, are present to his eyes;"
11011,THE ARGUMENT.,"His plighted hand, and hospitable ties."
11012,THE ARGUMENT.,
11013,THE ARGUMENT.,"Four sons of Sulmo, four whom Ufens bred,"
11014,THE ARGUMENT.,"He took in fight, and living victims led,"
11015,THE ARGUMENT.,"To please the ghost of Pallas, and expire,"
11016,THE ARGUMENT.,"In sacrifice, before his fun’ral fire."
11017,THE ARGUMENT.,At Magus next he threw: he stoop’d below
11018,THE ARGUMENT.,"The flying spear, and shunn’d the promis’d blow;"
11019,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, creeping, clasp’d the hero’s knees, and pray’d:"
11020,THE ARGUMENT.,"“By young Iulus, by thy father’s shade,"
11021,THE ARGUMENT.,"O spare my life, and send me back to see"
11022,THE ARGUMENT.,"My longing sire, and tender progeny!"
11023,THE ARGUMENT.,"A lofty house I have, and wealth untold,"
11024,THE ARGUMENT.,"In silver ingots, and in bars of gold:"
11025,THE ARGUMENT.,"All these, and sums besides, which see no day,"
11026,THE ARGUMENT.,The ransom of this one poor life shall pay.
11027,THE ARGUMENT.,"If I survive, will Troy the less prevail?"
11028,THE ARGUMENT.,A single soul’s too light to turn the scale.”
11029,THE ARGUMENT.,He said. The hero sternly thus replied:
11030,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Thy bars and ingots, and the sums beside,"
11031,THE ARGUMENT.,Leave for thy children’s lot. Thy Turnus broke
11032,THE ARGUMENT.,"All rules of war by one relentless stroke,"
11033,THE ARGUMENT.,"When Pallas fell: so deems, nor deems alone"
11034,THE ARGUMENT.,"My father’s shadow, but my living son.”"
11035,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus having said, of kind remorse bereft,"
11036,THE ARGUMENT.,"He seiz’d his helm, and dragg’d him with his left;"
11037,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then with his right hand, while his neck he wreath’d,"
11038,THE ARGUMENT.,Up to the hilts his shining falchion sheath’d.
11039,THE ARGUMENT.,
11040,THE ARGUMENT.,"Apollo’s priest, Emonides, was near;"
11041,THE ARGUMENT.,His holy fillets on his front appear;
11042,THE ARGUMENT.,"Glitt’ring in arms, he shone amidst the crowd;"
11043,THE ARGUMENT.,"Much of his god, more of his purple, proud."
11044,THE ARGUMENT.,Him the fierce Trojan follow’d thro’ the field:
11045,THE ARGUMENT.,"The holy coward fell; and, forc’d to yield,"
11046,THE ARGUMENT.,"The prince stood o’er the priest, and, at one blow,"
11047,THE ARGUMENT.,Sent him an off’ring to the shades below.
11048,THE ARGUMENT.,"His arms Seresthus on his shoulders bears,"
11049,THE ARGUMENT.,Design’d a trophy to the God of Wars.
11050,THE ARGUMENT.,
11051,THE ARGUMENT.,"Vulcanian Caeculus renews the fight,"
11052,THE ARGUMENT.,"And Umbro, born upon the mountains’ height."
11053,THE ARGUMENT.,"The champion cheers his troops t’ encounter those,"
11054,THE ARGUMENT.,And seeks revenge himself on other foes.
11055,THE ARGUMENT.,"At Anxur’s shield he drove; and, at the blow,"
11056,THE ARGUMENT.,Both shield and arm to ground together go.
11057,THE ARGUMENT.,"Anxur had boasted much of magic charms,"
11058,THE ARGUMENT.,"And thought he wore impenetrable arms,"
11059,THE ARGUMENT.,"So made by mutter’d spells; and, from the spheres,"
11060,THE ARGUMENT.,"Had life secur’d, in vain, for length of years."
11061,THE ARGUMENT.,Then Tarquitus the field in triumph trod;
11062,THE ARGUMENT.,"A nymph his mother, his sire a god."
11063,THE ARGUMENT.,"Exulting in bright arms, he braves the prince:"
11064,THE ARGUMENT.,With his protended lance he makes defence;
11065,THE ARGUMENT.,"Bears back his feeble foe; then, pressing on,"
11066,THE ARGUMENT.,"Arrests his better hand, and drags him down;"
11067,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stands o’er the prostrate wretch, and, as he lay,"
11068,THE ARGUMENT.,"Vain tales inventing, and prepar’d to pray,"
11069,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mows off his head: the trunk a moment stood,"
11070,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then sunk, and roll’d along the sand in blood."
11071,THE ARGUMENT.,The vengeful victor thus upbraids the slain:
11072,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Lie there, proud man, unpitied, on the plain;"
11073,THE ARGUMENT.,"Lie there, inglorious, and without a tomb,"
11074,THE ARGUMENT.,"Far from thy mother and thy native home,"
11075,THE ARGUMENT.,"Exposed to savage beasts, and birds of prey,"
11076,THE ARGUMENT.,Or thrown for food to monsters of the sea.”
11077,THE ARGUMENT.,
11078,THE ARGUMENT.,"On Lycas and Antaeus next he ran,"
11079,THE ARGUMENT.,"Two chiefs of Turnus, and who led his van."
11080,THE ARGUMENT.,"They fled for fear; with these, he chas’d along"
11081,THE ARGUMENT.,"Camers the yellow-lock’d, and Numa strong;"
11082,THE ARGUMENT.,"Both great in arms, and both were fair and young."
11083,THE ARGUMENT.,"Camers was son to Volscens lately slain,"
11084,THE ARGUMENT.,"In wealth surpassing all the Latian train,"
11085,THE ARGUMENT.,And in Amycla fix’d his silent easy reign.
11086,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, as Aegaeon, when with heav’n he strove,"
11087,THE ARGUMENT.,Stood opposite in arms to mighty Jove;
11088,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mov’d all his hundred hands, provok’d the war,"
11089,THE ARGUMENT.,Defied the forky lightning from afar;
11090,THE ARGUMENT.,"At fifty mouths his flaming breath expires,"
11091,THE ARGUMENT.,"And flash for flash returns, and fires for fires;"
11092,THE ARGUMENT.,"In his right hand as many swords he wields,"
11093,THE ARGUMENT.,And takes the thunder on as many shields:
11094,THE ARGUMENT.,"With strength like his, the Trojan hero stood;"
11095,THE ARGUMENT.,"And soon the fields with falling corps were strow’d,"
11096,THE ARGUMENT.,When once his falchion found the taste of blood.
11097,THE ARGUMENT.,"With fury scarce to be conceiv’d, he flew"
11098,THE ARGUMENT.,"Against Niphaeus, whom four coursers drew."
11099,THE ARGUMENT.,"They, when they see the fiery chief advance,"
11100,THE ARGUMENT.,"And pushing at their chests his pointed lance,"
11101,THE ARGUMENT.,"Wheel’d with so swift a motion, mad with fear,"
11102,THE ARGUMENT.,They threw their master headlong from the chair.
11103,THE ARGUMENT.,"They stare, they start, nor stop their course, before"
11104,THE ARGUMENT.,They bear the bounding chariot to the shore.
11105,THE ARGUMENT.,
11106,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now Lucagus and Liger scour the plains,"
11107,THE ARGUMENT.,"With two white steeds; but Liger holds the reins,"
11108,THE ARGUMENT.,And Lucagus the lofty seat maintains:
11109,THE ARGUMENT.,Bold brethren both. The former wav’d in air
11110,THE ARGUMENT.,"His flaming sword: Aeneas couch’d his spear,"
11111,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unus’d to threats, and more unus’d to fear."
11112,THE ARGUMENT.,Then Liger thus: “Thy confidence is vain
11113,THE ARGUMENT.,"To scape from hence, as from the Trojan plain:"
11114,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor these the steeds which Diomede bestrode,"
11115,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor this the chariot where Achilles rode;
11116,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor Venus’ veil is here, near Neptune’s shield;"
11117,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy fatal hour is come, and this the field.”"
11118,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus Liger vainly vaunts: the Trojan peer
11119,THE ARGUMENT.,Return’d his answer with his flying spear.
11120,THE ARGUMENT.,"As Lucagus, to lash his horses, bends,"
11121,THE ARGUMENT.,"Prone to the wheels, and his left foot protends,"
11122,THE ARGUMENT.,"Prepar’d for fight; the fatal dart arrives,"
11123,THE ARGUMENT.,And thro’ the borders of his buckler drives;
11124,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pass’d thro’ and pierc’d his groin: the deadly wound,"
11125,THE ARGUMENT.,"Cast from his chariot, roll’d him on the ground."
11126,THE ARGUMENT.,Whom thus the chief upbraids with scornful spite:
11127,THE ARGUMENT.,“Blame not the slowness of your steeds in flight;
11128,THE ARGUMENT.,Vain shadows did not force their swift retreat;
11129,THE ARGUMENT.,But you yourself forsake your empty seat.”
11130,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said, and seiz’d at once the loosen’d rein;"
11131,THE ARGUMENT.,"For Liger lay already on the plain,"
11132,THE ARGUMENT.,"By the same shock: then, stretching out his hands,"
11133,THE ARGUMENT.,The recreant thus his wretched life demands:
11134,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Now, by thyself, O more than mortal man!"
11135,THE ARGUMENT.,"By her and him from whom thy breath began,"
11136,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who form’d thee thus divine, I beg thee, spare"
11137,THE ARGUMENT.,"This forfeit life, and hear thy suppliant’s pray’r.”"
11138,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus much he spoke, and more he would have said;"
11139,THE ARGUMENT.,"But the stern hero turn’d aside his head,"
11140,THE ARGUMENT.,And cut him short: “I hear another man;
11141,THE ARGUMENT.,You talk’d not thus before the fight began.
11142,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now take your turn; and, as a brother should,"
11143,THE ARGUMENT.,Attend your brother to the Stygian flood.”
11144,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then thro’ his breast his fatal sword he sent,"
11145,THE ARGUMENT.,And the soul issued at the gaping vent.
11146,THE ARGUMENT.,
11147,THE ARGUMENT.,"As storms the skies, and torrents tear the ground,"
11148,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus rag’d the prince, and scatter’d deaths around."
11149,THE ARGUMENT.,At length Ascanius and the Trojan train
11150,THE ARGUMENT.,"Broke from the camp, so long besieg’d in vain."
11151,THE ARGUMENT.,
11152,THE ARGUMENT.,Meantime the King of Gods and Mortal Man
11153,THE ARGUMENT.,"Held conference with his queen, and thus began:"
11154,THE ARGUMENT.,"“My sister goddess, and well-pleasing wife,"
11155,THE ARGUMENT.,Still think you Venus’ aid supports the strife—
11156,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sustains her Trojans—or themselves, alone,"
11157,THE ARGUMENT.,With inborn valour force their fortune on?
11158,THE ARGUMENT.,"How fierce in fight, with courage undecay’d!"
11159,THE ARGUMENT.,Judge if such warriors want immortal aid.”
11160,THE ARGUMENT.,"To whom the goddess with the charming eyes,"
11161,THE ARGUMENT.,"Soft in her tone, submissively replies:"
11162,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Why, O my sov’reign lord, whose frown I fear,"
11163,THE ARGUMENT.,"And cannot, unconcern’d, your anger bear;"
11164,THE ARGUMENT.,"Why urge you thus my grief? when, if I still"
11165,THE ARGUMENT.,"(As once I was) were mistress of your will,"
11166,THE ARGUMENT.,From your almighty pow’r your pleasing wife
11167,THE ARGUMENT.,"Might gain the grace of length’ning Turnus’ life,"
11168,THE ARGUMENT.,"Securely snatch him from the fatal fight,"
11169,THE ARGUMENT.,And give him to his aged father’s sight.
11170,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now let him perish, since you hold it good,"
11171,THE ARGUMENT.,And glut the Trojans with his pious blood.
11172,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet from our lineage he derives his name,"
11173,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, in the fourth degree, from god Pilumnus came;"
11174,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet he devoutly pays you rites divine,"
11175,THE ARGUMENT.,And offers daily incense at your shrine.”
11176,THE ARGUMENT.,
11177,THE ARGUMENT.,Then shortly thus the sov’reign god replied:
11178,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Since in my pow’r and goodness you confide,"
11179,THE ARGUMENT.,"If for a little space, a lengthen’d span,"
11180,THE ARGUMENT.,"You beg reprieve for this expiring man,"
11181,THE ARGUMENT.,I grant you leave to take your Turnus hence
11182,THE ARGUMENT.,"From instant fate, and can so far dispense."
11183,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, if some secret meaning lies beneath,"
11184,THE ARGUMENT.,"To save the short-liv’d youth from destin’d death,"
11185,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or if a farther thought you entertain,"
11186,THE ARGUMENT.,To change the fates; you feed your hopes in vain.”
11187,THE ARGUMENT.,"To whom the goddess thus, with weeping eyes:"
11188,THE ARGUMENT.,"“And what if that request, your tongue denies,"
11189,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your heart should grant; and not a short reprieve,"
11190,THE ARGUMENT.,"But length of certain life, to Turnus give?"
11191,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now speedy death attends the guiltless youth,"
11192,THE ARGUMENT.,If my presaging soul divines with truth;
11193,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which, O! I wish, might err thro’ causeless fears,"
11194,THE ARGUMENT.,And you (for you have pow’r) prolong his years!”
11195,THE ARGUMENT.,
11196,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus having said, involv’d in clouds, she flies,"
11197,THE ARGUMENT.,And drives a storm before her thro’ the skies.
11198,THE ARGUMENT.,"Swift she descends, alighting on the plain,"
11199,THE ARGUMENT.,Where the fierce foes a dubious fight maintain.
11200,THE ARGUMENT.,Of air condens’d a spectre soon she made;
11201,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, what Aeneas was, such seem’d the shade."
11202,THE ARGUMENT.,"Adorn’d with Dardan arms, the phantom bore"
11203,THE ARGUMENT.,His head aloft; a plumy crest he wore;
11204,THE ARGUMENT.,"This hand appear’d a shining sword to wield,"
11205,THE ARGUMENT.,And that sustain’d an imitated shield.
11206,THE ARGUMENT.,"With manly mien he stalk’d along the ground,"
11207,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor wanted voice belied, nor vaunting sound."
11208,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Thus haunting ghosts appear to waking sight,"
11209,THE ARGUMENT.,Or dreadful visions in our dreams by night.)
11210,THE ARGUMENT.,"The spectre seems the Daunian chief to dare,"
11211,THE ARGUMENT.,And flourishes his empty sword in air.
11212,THE ARGUMENT.,"At this, advancing, Turnus hurl’d his spear:"
11213,THE ARGUMENT.,"The phantom wheel’d, and seem’d to fly for fear."
11214,THE ARGUMENT.,"Deluded Turnus thought the Trojan fled,"
11215,THE ARGUMENT.,And with vain hopes his haughty fancy fed.
11216,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Whether, O coward?” (thus he calls aloud,"
11217,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor found he spoke to wind, and chas’d a cloud,)"
11218,THE ARGUMENT.,“Why thus forsake your bride! Receive from me
11219,THE ARGUMENT.,The fated land you sought so long by sea.”
11220,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said, and, brandishing at once his blade,"
11221,THE ARGUMENT.,With eager pace pursued the flying shade.
11222,THE ARGUMENT.,"By chance a ship was fasten’d to the shore,"
11223,THE ARGUMENT.,Which from old Clusium King Osinius bore:
11224,THE ARGUMENT.,The plank was ready laid for safe ascent;
11225,THE ARGUMENT.,"For shelter there the trembling shadow bent,"
11226,THE ARGUMENT.,"And skipp’t and skulk’d, and under hatches went."
11227,THE ARGUMENT.,"Exulting Turnus, with regardless haste,"
11228,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ascends the plank, and to the galley pass’d."
11229,THE ARGUMENT.,Scarce had he reach’d the prow: Saturnia’s hand
11230,THE ARGUMENT.,"The haulsers cuts, and shoots the ship from land."
11231,THE ARGUMENT.,"With wind in poop, the vessel plows the sea,"
11232,THE ARGUMENT.,And measures back with speed her former way.
11233,THE ARGUMENT.,"Meantime Aeneas seeks his absent foe,"
11234,THE ARGUMENT.,And sends his slaughter’d troops to shades below.
11235,THE ARGUMENT.,
11236,THE ARGUMENT.,"The guileful phantom now forsook the shroud,"
11237,THE ARGUMENT.,"And flew sublime, and vanish’d in a cloud."
11238,THE ARGUMENT.,"Too late young Turnus the delusion found,"
11239,THE ARGUMENT.,"Far on the sea, still making from the ground."
11240,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, thankless for a life redeem’d by shame,"
11241,THE ARGUMENT.,"With sense of honour stung, and forfeit fame,"
11242,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fearful besides of what in fight had pass’d,"
11243,THE ARGUMENT.,His hands and haggard eyes to heav’n he cast;
11244,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O Jove!” he cried, “for what offence have I"
11245,THE ARGUMENT.,Deserv’d to bear this endless infamy?
11246,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whence am I forc’d, and whether am I borne?"
11247,THE ARGUMENT.,"How, and with what reproach, shall I return?"
11248,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shall ever I behold the Latian plain,"
11249,THE ARGUMENT.,Or see Laurentum’s lofty tow’rs again?
11250,THE ARGUMENT.,What will they say of their deserting chief
11251,THE ARGUMENT.,The war was mine: I fly from their relief;
11252,THE ARGUMENT.,"I led to slaughter, and in slaughter leave;"
11253,THE ARGUMENT.,And ev’n from hence their dying groans receive.
11254,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here, overmatch’d in fight, in heaps they lie;"
11255,THE ARGUMENT.,"There, scatter’d o’er the fields, ignobly fly."
11256,THE ARGUMENT.,"Gape wide, O earth, and draw me down alive!"
11257,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or, O ye pitying winds, a wretch relieve!"
11258,THE ARGUMENT.,On sands or shelves the splitting vessel drive;
11259,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or set me shipwreck’d on some desert shore,"
11260,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where no Rutulian eyes may see me more,"
11261,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unknown to friends, or foes, or conscious Fame,"
11262,THE ARGUMENT.,"Lest she should follow, and my flight proclaim.”"
11263,THE ARGUMENT.,
11264,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus Turnus rav’d, and various fates revolv’d:"
11265,THE ARGUMENT.,"The choice was doubtful, but the death resolv’d."
11266,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now the sword, and now the sea took place,"
11267,THE ARGUMENT.,"That to revenge, and this to purge disgrace."
11268,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sometimes he thought to swim the stormy main,"
11269,THE ARGUMENT.,By stretch of arms the distant shore to gain.
11270,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thrice he the sword assay’d, and thrice the flood;"
11271,THE ARGUMENT.,"But Juno, mov’d with pity, both withstood."
11272,THE ARGUMENT.,"And thrice repress’d his rage; strong gales supplied,"
11273,THE ARGUMENT.,And push’d the vessel o’er the swelling tide.
11274,THE ARGUMENT.,"At length she lands him on his native shores,"
11275,THE ARGUMENT.,And to his father’s longing arms restores.
11276,THE ARGUMENT.,
11277,THE ARGUMENT.,"Meantime, by Jove’s impulse, Mezentius arm’d,"
11278,THE ARGUMENT.,"Succeeding Turnus, with his ardour warm’d"
11279,THE ARGUMENT.,"His fainting friends, reproach’d their shameful flight,"
11280,THE ARGUMENT.,"Repell’d the victors, and renew’d the fight."
11281,THE ARGUMENT.,Against their king the Tuscan troops conspire;
11282,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such is their hate, and such their fierce desire"
11283,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of wish’d revenge: on him, and him alone,"
11284,THE ARGUMENT.,"All hands employ’d, and all their darts are thrown."
11285,THE ARGUMENT.,"He, like a solid rock by seas inclos’d,"
11286,THE ARGUMENT.,"To raging winds and roaring waves oppos’d,"
11287,THE ARGUMENT.,"From his proud summit looking down, disdains"
11288,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their empty menace, and unmov’d remains."
11289,THE ARGUMENT.,
11290,THE ARGUMENT.,"Beneath his feet fell haughty Hebrus dead,"
11291,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Latagus, and Palmus as he fled."
11292,THE ARGUMENT.,At Latagus a weighty stone he flung:
11293,THE ARGUMENT.,"His face was flatted, and his helmet rung."
11294,THE ARGUMENT.,But Palmus from behind receives his wound;
11295,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hamstring’d he falls, and grovels on the ground:"
11296,THE ARGUMENT.,"His crest and armour, from his body torn,"
11297,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy shoulders, Lausus, and thy head adorn."
11298,THE ARGUMENT.,"Evas and Mimas, both of Troy, he slew."
11299,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mimas his birth from fair Theano drew,"
11300,THE ARGUMENT.,"Born on that fatal night, when, big with fire,"
11301,THE ARGUMENT.,The queen produc’d young Paris to his sire:
11302,THE ARGUMENT.,"But Paris in the Phrygian fields was slain,"
11303,THE ARGUMENT.,Unthinking Mimas on the Latian plain.
11304,THE ARGUMENT.,
11305,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, as a savage boar, on mountains bred,"
11306,THE ARGUMENT.,"With forest mast and fatt’ning marshes fed,"
11307,THE ARGUMENT.,"When once he sees himself in toils inclos’d,"
11308,THE ARGUMENT.,"By huntsmen and their eager hounds oppos’d,"
11309,THE ARGUMENT.,"He whets his tusks, and turns, and dares the war;"
11310,THE ARGUMENT.,Th’ invaders dart their jav’lins from afar:
11311,THE ARGUMENT.,"All keep aloof, and safely shout around;"
11312,THE ARGUMENT.,But none presumes to give a nearer wound:
11313,THE ARGUMENT.,"He frets and froths, erects his bristled hide,"
11314,THE ARGUMENT.,And shakes a grove of lances from his side:
11315,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not otherwise the troops, with hate inspir’d,"
11316,THE ARGUMENT.,"And just revenge against the tyrant fir’d,"
11317,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their darts with clamour at a distance drive,"
11318,THE ARGUMENT.,And only keep the languish’d war alive.
11319,THE ARGUMENT.,
11320,THE ARGUMENT.,"From Coritus came Acron to the fight,"
11321,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who left his spouse betroth’d, and unconsummate night."
11322,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mezentius sees him thro’ the squadrons ride,"
11323,THE ARGUMENT.,Proud of the purple favours of his bride.
11324,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, as a hungry lion, who beholds"
11325,THE ARGUMENT.,"A gamesome goat, who frisks about the folds,"
11326,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or beamy stag, that grazes on the plain—"
11327,THE ARGUMENT.,"He runs, he roars, he shakes his rising mane,"
11328,THE ARGUMENT.,"He grins, and opens wide his greedy jaws;"
11329,THE ARGUMENT.,The prey lies panting underneath his paws:
11330,THE ARGUMENT.,He fills his famish’d maw; his mouth runs o’er
11331,THE ARGUMENT.,"With unchew’d morsels, while he churns the gore:"
11332,THE ARGUMENT.,"So proud Mezentius rushes on his foes,"
11333,THE ARGUMENT.,And first unhappy Acron overthrows:
11334,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stretch’d at his length, he spurns the swarthy ground;"
11335,THE ARGUMENT.,"The lance, besmear’d with blood, lies broken in the wound."
11336,THE ARGUMENT.,Then with disdain the haughty victor view’d
11337,THE ARGUMENT.,"Orodes flying, nor the wretch pursued,"
11338,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor thought the dastard’s back deserv’d a wound,"
11339,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, running, gain’d th’ advantage of the ground:"
11340,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then turning short, he met him face to face,"
11341,THE ARGUMENT.,To give his victory the better grace.
11342,THE ARGUMENT.,"Orodes falls, in equal fight oppress’d:"
11343,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mezentius fix’d his foot upon his breast,"
11344,THE ARGUMENT.,And rested lance; and thus aloud he cries:
11345,THE ARGUMENT.,“Lo! here the champion of my rebels lies!”
11346,THE ARGUMENT.,The fields around with Io Paean! ring;
11347,THE ARGUMENT.,And peals of shouts applaud the conqu’ring king.
11348,THE ARGUMENT.,"At this the vanquish’d, with his dying breath,"
11349,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus faintly spoke, and prophesied in death:"
11350,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Nor thou, proud man, unpunish’d shalt remain:"
11351,THE ARGUMENT.,Like death attends thee on this fatal plain.”
11352,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, sourly smiling, thus the king replied:"
11353,THE ARGUMENT.,"“For what belongs to me, let Jove provide;"
11354,THE ARGUMENT.,"But die thou first, whatever chance ensue.”"
11355,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said, and from the wound the weapon drew."
11356,THE ARGUMENT.,"A hov’ring mist came swimming o’er his sight,"
11357,THE ARGUMENT.,And seal’d his eyes in everlasting night.
11358,THE ARGUMENT.,
11359,THE ARGUMENT.,"By Caedicus, Alcathous was slain;"
11360,THE ARGUMENT.,Sacrator laid Hydaspes on the plain;
11361,THE ARGUMENT.,Orses the strong to greater strength must yield;
11362,THE ARGUMENT.,"He, with Parthenius, were by Rapo kill’d."
11363,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then brave Messapus Ericetes slew,"
11364,THE ARGUMENT.,Who from Lycaon’s blood his lineage drew.
11365,THE ARGUMENT.,"But from his headstrong horse his fate he found,"
11366,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who threw his master, as he made a bound:"
11367,THE ARGUMENT.,"The chief, alighting, stuck him to the ground;"
11368,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Clonius, hand to hand, on foot assails:"
11369,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojan sinks, and Neptune’s son prevails."
11370,THE ARGUMENT.,"Agis the Lycian, stepping forth with pride,"
11371,THE ARGUMENT.,To single fight the boldest foe defied;
11372,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whom Tuscan Valerus by force o’ercame,"
11373,THE ARGUMENT.,And not belied his mighty father’s fame.
11374,THE ARGUMENT.,Salius to death the great Antronius sent:
11375,THE ARGUMENT.,"But the same fate the victor underwent,"
11376,THE ARGUMENT.,"Slain by Nealces’ hand, well-skill’d to throw"
11377,THE ARGUMENT.,"The flying dart, and draw the far-deceiving bow."
11378,THE ARGUMENT.,
11379,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus equal deaths are dealt with equal chance;
11380,THE ARGUMENT.,"By turns they quit their ground, by turns advance:"
11381,THE ARGUMENT.,"Victors and vanquish’d, in the various field,"
11382,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor wholly overcome, nor wholly yield."
11383,THE ARGUMENT.,"The gods from heav’n survey the fatal strife,"
11384,THE ARGUMENT.,And mourn the miseries of human life.
11385,THE ARGUMENT.,"Above the rest, two goddesses appear"
11386,THE ARGUMENT.,"Concern’d for each: here Venus, Juno there."
11387,THE ARGUMENT.,"Amidst the crowd, infernal Ate shakes"
11388,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her scourge aloft, and crest of hissing snakes."
11389,THE ARGUMENT.,
11390,THE ARGUMENT.,"Once more the proud Mezentius, with disdain,"
11391,THE ARGUMENT.,"Brandish’d his spear, and rush’d into the plain,"
11392,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where tow’ring in the midmost rank he stood,"
11393,THE ARGUMENT.,Like tall Orion stalking o’er the flood.
11394,THE ARGUMENT.,"(When with his brawny breast he cuts the waves,"
11395,THE ARGUMENT.,"His shoulders scarce the topmost billow laves),"
11396,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or like a mountain ash, whose roots are spread,"
11397,THE ARGUMENT.,Deep fix’d in earth; in clouds he hides his head.
11398,THE ARGUMENT.,
11399,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojan prince beheld him from afar,"
11400,THE ARGUMENT.,And dauntless undertook the doubtful war.
11401,THE ARGUMENT.,"Collected in his strength, and like a rock,"
11402,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pois’d on his base, Mezentius stood the shock."
11403,THE ARGUMENT.,"He stood, and, measuring first with careful eyes"
11404,THE ARGUMENT.,"The space his spear could reach, aloud he cries:"
11405,THE ARGUMENT.,"“My strong right hand, and sword, assist my stroke!"
11406,THE ARGUMENT.,(Those only gods Mezentius will invoke.)
11407,THE ARGUMENT.,"His armour, from the Trojan pirate torn,"
11408,THE ARGUMENT.,By my triumphant Lausus shall be worn.”
11409,THE ARGUMENT.,He said; and with his utmost force he threw
11410,THE ARGUMENT.,"The massy spear, which, hissing as it flew,"
11411,THE ARGUMENT.,"Reach’d the celestial shield, that stopp’d the course;"
11412,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, glancing thence, the yet unbroken force"
11413,THE ARGUMENT.,"Took a new bent obliquely, and betwixt"
11414,THE ARGUMENT.,The side and bowels fam’d Anthores fix’d.
11415,THE ARGUMENT.,"Anthores had from Argos travel’d far,"
11416,THE ARGUMENT.,"Alcides’ friend, and brother of the war;"
11417,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till, tir’d with toils, fair Italy he chose,"
11418,THE ARGUMENT.,And in Evander’s palace sought repose.
11419,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, falling by another’s wound, his eyes"
11420,THE ARGUMENT.,"He cast to heav’n, on Argos thinks, and dies."
11421,THE ARGUMENT.,
11422,THE ARGUMENT.,The pious Trojan then his jav’lin sent;
11423,THE ARGUMENT.,The shield gave way; thro’ treble plates it went
11424,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of solid brass, of linen trebly roll’d,"
11425,THE ARGUMENT.,And three bull hides which round the buckler fold.
11426,THE ARGUMENT.,"All these it pass’d, resistless in the course,"
11427,THE ARGUMENT.,"Transpierc’d his thigh, and spent its dying force."
11428,THE ARGUMENT.,The gaping wound gush’d out a crimson flood.
11429,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojan, glad with sight of hostile blood,"
11430,THE ARGUMENT.,"His falchion drew, to closer fight address’d,"
11431,THE ARGUMENT.,And with new force his fainting foe oppress’d.
11432,THE ARGUMENT.,
11433,THE ARGUMENT.,His father’s peril Lausus view’d with grief;
11434,THE ARGUMENT.,"He sigh’d, he wept, he ran to his relief."
11435,THE ARGUMENT.,"And here, heroic youth, ’tis here I must"
11436,THE ARGUMENT.,"To thy immortal memory be just,"
11437,THE ARGUMENT.,"And sing an act so noble and so new,"
11438,THE ARGUMENT.,Posterity will scarce believe ’tis true.
11439,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pain’d with his wound, and useless for the fight,"
11440,THE ARGUMENT.,The father sought to save himself by flight:
11441,THE ARGUMENT.,"Encumber’d, slow he dragg’d the spear along,"
11442,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which pierc’d his thigh, and in his buckler hung."
11443,THE ARGUMENT.,"The pious youth, resolv’d on death, below"
11444,THE ARGUMENT.,The lifted sword springs forth to face the foe;
11445,THE ARGUMENT.,"Protects his parent, and prevents the blow."
11446,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shouts of applause ran ringing thro’ the field,"
11447,THE ARGUMENT.,To see the son the vanquish’d father shield.
11448,THE ARGUMENT.,"All, fir’d with gen’rous indignation, strive,"
11449,THE ARGUMENT.,And with a storm of darts to distance drive
11450,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojan chief, who, held at bay from far,"
11451,THE ARGUMENT.,On his Vulcanian orb sustain’d the war.
11452,THE ARGUMENT.,
11453,THE ARGUMENT.,"As, when thick hail comes rattling in the wind,"
11454,THE ARGUMENT.,"The plowman, passenger, and lab’ring hind"
11455,THE ARGUMENT.,"For shelter to the neighb’ring covert fly,"
11456,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or hous’d, or safe in hollow caverns lie;"
11457,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, that o’erblown, when heav’n above ’em smiles,"
11458,THE ARGUMENT.,"Return to travel, and renew their toils:"
11459,THE ARGUMENT.,"Aeneas thus, o’erwhelmed on ev’ry side,"
11460,THE ARGUMENT.,"The storm of darts, undaunted, did abide;"
11461,THE ARGUMENT.,And thus to Lausus loud with friendly threat’ning cried:
11462,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Why wilt thou rush to certain death, and rage"
11463,THE ARGUMENT.,"In rash attempts, beyond thy tender age,"
11464,THE ARGUMENT.,"Betray’d by pious love?” Nor, thus forborne,"
11465,THE ARGUMENT.,"The youth desists, but with insulting scorn"
11466,THE ARGUMENT.,"Provokes the ling’ring prince, whose patience, tir’d,"
11467,THE ARGUMENT.,Gave place; and all his breast with fury fir’d.
11468,THE ARGUMENT.,For now the Fates prepar’d their sharpen’d shears;
11469,THE ARGUMENT.,"And lifted high the flaming sword appears,"
11470,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which, full descending with a frightful sway,"
11471,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thro’ shield and corslet forc’d th’ impetuous way,"
11472,THE ARGUMENT.,And buried deep in his fair bosom lay.
11473,THE ARGUMENT.,"The purple streams thro’ the thin armour strove,"
11474,THE ARGUMENT.,And drench’d th’ imbroider’d coat his mother wove;
11475,THE ARGUMENT.,"And life at length forsook his heaving heart,"
11476,THE ARGUMENT.,Loth from so sweet a mansion to depart.
11477,THE ARGUMENT.,
11478,THE ARGUMENT.,"But when, with blood and paleness all o’erspread,"
11479,THE ARGUMENT.,"The pious prince beheld young Lausus dead,"
11480,THE ARGUMENT.,He griev’d; he wept; the sight an image brought
11481,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of his own filial love, a sadly pleasing thought:"
11482,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then stretch’d his hand to hold him up, and said:"
11483,THE ARGUMENT.,“Poor hapless youth! what praises can be paid
11484,THE ARGUMENT.,"To love so great, to such transcendent store"
11485,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of early worth, and sure presage of more?"
11486,THE ARGUMENT.,Accept whate’er Aeneas can afford;
11487,THE ARGUMENT.,"Untouch’d thy arms, untaken be thy sword;"
11488,THE ARGUMENT.,"And all that pleas’d thee living, still remain"
11489,THE ARGUMENT.,"Inviolate, and sacred to the slain."
11490,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy body on thy parents I bestow,"
11491,THE ARGUMENT.,"To rest thy soul, at least, if shadows know,"
11492,THE ARGUMENT.,Or have a sense of human things below.
11493,THE ARGUMENT.,There to thy fellow ghosts with glory tell:
11494,THE ARGUMENT.,‘’Twas by the great Aeneas hand I fell.’”
11495,THE ARGUMENT.,"With this, his distant friends he beckons near,"
11496,THE ARGUMENT.,"Provokes their duty, and prevents their fear:"
11497,THE ARGUMENT.,"Himself assists to lift him from the ground,"
11498,THE ARGUMENT.,"With clotted locks, and blood that well’d from out the wound."
11499,THE ARGUMENT.,
11500,THE ARGUMENT.,"Meantime, his father, now no father, stood,"
11501,THE ARGUMENT.,And wash’d his wounds by Tiber’s yellow flood:
11502,THE ARGUMENT.,"Oppress’d with anguish, panting, and o’erspent,"
11503,THE ARGUMENT.,His fainting limbs against an oak he leant.
11504,THE ARGUMENT.,A bough his brazen helmet did sustain;
11505,THE ARGUMENT.,His heavier arms lay scatter’d on the plain:
11506,THE ARGUMENT.,A chosen train of youth around him stand;
11507,THE ARGUMENT.,His drooping head was rested on his hand:
11508,THE ARGUMENT.,His grisly beard his pensive bosom sought;
11509,THE ARGUMENT.,And all on Lausus ran his restless thought.
11510,THE ARGUMENT.,"Careful, concern’d his danger to prevent,"
11511,THE ARGUMENT.,"He much enquir’d, and many a message sent"
11512,THE ARGUMENT.,To warn him from the field—alas! in vain!
11513,THE ARGUMENT.,"Behold, his mournful followers bear him slain!"
11514,THE ARGUMENT.,"O’er his broad shield still gush’d the yawning wound,"
11515,THE ARGUMENT.,And drew a bloody trail along the ground.
11516,THE ARGUMENT.,"Far off he heard their cries, far off divin’d"
11517,THE ARGUMENT.,"The dire event, with a foreboding mind."
11518,THE ARGUMENT.,With dust he sprinkled first his hoary head;
11519,THE ARGUMENT.,Then both his lifted hands to heav’n he spread;
11520,THE ARGUMENT.,"Last, the dear corpse embracing, thus he said:"
11521,THE ARGUMENT.,"“What joys, alas! could this frail being give,"
11522,THE ARGUMENT.,That I have been so covetous to live?
11523,THE ARGUMENT.,"To see my son, and such a son, resign"
11524,THE ARGUMENT.,"His life, a ransom for preserving mine!"
11525,THE ARGUMENT.,"And am I then preserv’d, and art thou lost?"
11526,THE ARGUMENT.,How much too dear has that redemption cost!
11527,THE ARGUMENT.,’Tis now my bitter banishment I feel:
11528,THE ARGUMENT.,This is a wound too deep for time to heal.
11529,THE ARGUMENT.,My guilt thy growing virtues did defame;
11530,THE ARGUMENT.,My blackness blotted thy unblemish’d name.
11531,THE ARGUMENT.,"Chas’d from a throne, abandon’d, and exil’d"
11532,THE ARGUMENT.,"For foul misdeeds, were punishments too mild:"
11533,THE ARGUMENT.,"I ow’d my people these, and, from their hate,"
11534,THE ARGUMENT.,With less resentment could have borne my fate.
11535,THE ARGUMENT.,"And yet I live, and yet sustain the sight"
11536,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of hated men, and of more hated light:"
11537,THE ARGUMENT.,But will not long.” With that he rais’d from ground
11538,THE ARGUMENT.,"His fainting limbs, that stagger’d with his wound;"
11539,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet, with a mind resolv’d, and unappall’d"
11540,THE ARGUMENT.,"With pains or perils, for his courser call’d"
11541,THE ARGUMENT.,"Well-mouth’d, well-manag’d, whom himself did dress"
11542,THE ARGUMENT.,"With daily care, and mounted with success;"
11543,THE ARGUMENT.,"His aid in arms, his ornament in peace."
11544,THE ARGUMENT.,
11545,THE ARGUMENT.,"Soothing his courage with a gentle stroke,"
11546,THE ARGUMENT.,"The steed seem’d sensible, while thus he spoke:"
11547,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O Rhoebus, we have liv’d too long for me—"
11548,THE ARGUMENT.,If life and long were terms that could agree!
11549,THE ARGUMENT.,This day thou either shalt bring back the head
11550,THE ARGUMENT.,And bloody trophies of the Trojan dead;
11551,THE ARGUMENT.,"This day thou either shalt revenge my woe,"
11552,THE ARGUMENT.,"For murder’d Lausus, on his cruel foe;"
11553,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or, if inexorable fate deny"
11554,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our conquest, with thy conquer’d master die:"
11555,THE ARGUMENT.,"For, after such a lord, I rest secure,"
11556,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thou wilt no foreign reins, or Trojan load endure.”"
11557,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said; and straight th’ officious courser kneels,"
11558,THE ARGUMENT.,To take his wonted weight. His hands he fills
11559,THE ARGUMENT.,With pointed jav’lins; on his head he lac’d
11560,THE ARGUMENT.,"His glitt’ring helm, which terribly was grac’d"
11561,THE ARGUMENT.,"With waving horsehair, nodding from afar;"
11562,THE ARGUMENT.,Then spurr’d his thund’ring steed amidst the war.
11563,THE ARGUMENT.,"Love, anguish, wrath, and grief, to madness wrought,"
11564,THE ARGUMENT.,"Despair, and secret shame, and conscious thought"
11565,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of inborn worth, his lab’ring soul oppress’d,"
11566,THE ARGUMENT.,"Roll’d in his eyes, and rag’d within his breast."
11567,THE ARGUMENT.,Then loud he call’d Aeneas thrice by name:
11568,THE ARGUMENT.,The loud repeated voice to glad Aeneas came.
11569,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Great Jove,” he said, “and the far-shooting god,"
11570,THE ARGUMENT.,Inspire thy mind to make thy challenge good!”
11571,THE ARGUMENT.,"He spoke no more; but hasten’d, void of fear,"
11572,THE ARGUMENT.,And threaten’d with his long protended spear.
11573,THE ARGUMENT.,
11574,THE ARGUMENT.,To whom Mezentius thus: “Thy vaunts are vain.
11575,THE ARGUMENT.,My Lausus lies extended on the plain:
11576,THE ARGUMENT.,He’s lost! thy conquest is already won;
11577,THE ARGUMENT.,The wretched sire is murder’d in the son.
11578,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor fate I fear, but all the gods defy."
11579,THE ARGUMENT.,Forbear thy threats: my bus’ness is to die;
11580,THE ARGUMENT.,But first receive this parting legacy.”
11581,THE ARGUMENT.,He said; and straight a whirling dart he sent;
11582,THE ARGUMENT.,"Another after, and another went."
11583,THE ARGUMENT.,"Round in a spacious ring he rides the field,"
11584,THE ARGUMENT.,And vainly plies th’ impenetrable shield.
11585,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thrice rode he round; and thrice Aeneas wheel’d,"
11586,THE ARGUMENT.,Turn’d as he turn’d: the golden orb withstood
11587,THE ARGUMENT.,"The strokes, and bore about an iron wood."
11588,THE ARGUMENT.,"Impatient of delay, and weary grown,"
11589,THE ARGUMENT.,"Still to defend, and to defend alone,"
11590,THE ARGUMENT.,"To wrench the darts which in his buckler light,"
11591,THE ARGUMENT.,Urg’d and o’er-labour’d in unequal fight;
11592,THE ARGUMENT.,"At length resolv’d, he throws with all his force"
11593,THE ARGUMENT.,Full at the temples of the warrior horse.
11594,THE ARGUMENT.,"Just where the stroke was aim’d, th’ unerring spear"
11595,THE ARGUMENT.,"Made way, and stood transfix’d thro’ either ear."
11596,THE ARGUMENT.,"Seiz’d with unwonted pain, surpris’d with fright,"
11597,THE ARGUMENT.,"The wounded steed curvets, and, rais’d upright,"
11598,THE ARGUMENT.,Lights on his feet before; his hoofs behind
11599,THE ARGUMENT.,"Spring up in air aloft, and lash the wind."
11600,THE ARGUMENT.,Down comes the rider headlong from his height:
11601,THE ARGUMENT.,"His horse came after with unwieldy weight,"
11602,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, flound’ring forward, pitching on his head,"
11603,THE ARGUMENT.,His lord’s encumber’d shoulder overlaid.
11604,THE ARGUMENT.,
11605,THE ARGUMENT.,"From either host, the mingled shouts and cries"
11606,THE ARGUMENT.,Of Trojans and Rutulians rend the skies.
11607,THE ARGUMENT.,"Aeneas, hast’ning, wav’d his fatal sword"
11608,THE ARGUMENT.,"High o’er his head, with this reproachful word:"
11609,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Now; where are now thy vaunts, the fierce disdain"
11610,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of proud Mezentius, and the lofty strain?”"
11611,THE ARGUMENT.,
11612,THE ARGUMENT.,"Struggling, and wildly staring on the skies,"
11613,THE ARGUMENT.,With scarce recover’d sight he thus replies:
11614,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Why these insulting words, this waste of breath,"
11615,THE ARGUMENT.,"To souls undaunted, and secure of death?"
11616,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Tis no dishonour for the brave to die,"
11617,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor came I here with hope of victory;
11618,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor ask I life, nor fought with that design:"
11619,THE ARGUMENT.,"As I had us’d my fortune, use thou thine."
11620,THE ARGUMENT.,My dying son contracted no such band;
11621,THE ARGUMENT.,The gift is hateful from his murd’rer’s hand.
11622,THE ARGUMENT.,"For this, this only favour let me sue,"
11623,THE ARGUMENT.,If pity can to conquer’d foes be due:
11624,THE ARGUMENT.,Refuse it not; but let my body have
11625,THE ARGUMENT.,"The last retreat of humankind, a grave."
11626,THE ARGUMENT.,Too well I know th’ insulting people’s hate;
11627,THE ARGUMENT.,Protect me from their vengeance after fate:
11628,THE ARGUMENT.,"This refuge for my poor remains provide,"
11629,THE ARGUMENT.,And lay my much-lov’d Lausus by my side.”
11630,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said, and to the sword his throat applied."
11631,THE ARGUMENT.,"The crimson stream distain’d his arms around,"
11632,THE ARGUMENT.,And the disdainful soul came rushing thro’ the wound.

11681,THE ARGUMENT.,"And I, at Heav’n’s appointed hour, may find"
11682,THE ARGUMENT.,Your warlike ensigns waving in the wind.
11683,THE ARGUMENT.,"Meantime the rites and fun’ral pomps prepare,"
11684,THE ARGUMENT.,Due to your dead companions of the war:
11685,THE ARGUMENT.,"The last respect the living can bestow,"
11686,THE ARGUMENT.,To shield their shadows from contempt below.
11687,THE ARGUMENT.,"That conquer’d earth be theirs, for which they fought,"
11688,THE ARGUMENT.,And which for us with their own blood they bought;
11689,THE ARGUMENT.,But first the corpse of our unhappy friend
11690,THE ARGUMENT.,"To the sad city of Evander send,"
11691,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who, not inglorious, in his age’s bloom,"
11692,THE ARGUMENT.,Was hurried hence by too severe a doom.”
11693,THE ARGUMENT.,
11694,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus, weeping while he spoke, he took his way,"
11695,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where, new in death, lamented Pallas lay."
11696,THE ARGUMENT.,Acoetes watch’d the corpse; whose youth deserv’d
11697,THE ARGUMENT.,The father’s trust; and now the son he serv’d
11698,THE ARGUMENT.,"With equal faith, but less auspicious care."
11699,THE ARGUMENT.,Th’ attendants of the slain his sorrow share.
11700,THE ARGUMENT.,"A troop of Trojans mix’d with these appear,"
11701,THE ARGUMENT.,And mourning matrons with dishevel’d hair.
11702,THE ARGUMENT.,"Soon as the prince appears, they raise a cry;"
11703,THE ARGUMENT.,"All beat their breasts, and echoes rend the sky."
11704,THE ARGUMENT.,They rear his drooping forehead from the ground;
11705,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, when Aeneas view’d the grisly wound"
11706,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which Pallas in his manly bosom bore,"
11707,THE ARGUMENT.,And the fair flesh distain’d with purple gore;
11708,THE ARGUMENT.,"First, melting into tears, the pious man"
11709,THE ARGUMENT.,"Deplor’d so sad a sight, then thus began:"
11710,THE ARGUMENT.,“Unhappy youth! when Fortune gave the rest
11711,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of my full wishes, she refus’d the best!"
11712,THE ARGUMENT.,"She came; but brought not thee along, to bless"
11713,THE ARGUMENT.,"My longing eyes, and share in my success:"
11714,THE ARGUMENT.,"She grudg’d thy safe return, the triumphs due"
11715,THE ARGUMENT.,"To prosp’rous valour, in the public view."
11716,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not thus I promis’d, when thy father lent"
11717,THE ARGUMENT.,Thy needless succour with a sad consent;
11718,THE ARGUMENT.,"Embrac’d me, parting for th’ Etrurian land,"
11719,THE ARGUMENT.,And sent me to possess a large command.
11720,THE ARGUMENT.,"He warn’d, and from his own experience told,"
11721,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our foes were warlike, disciplin’d, and bold."
11722,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now perhaps, in hopes of thy return,"
11723,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rich odors on his loaded altars burn,"
11724,THE ARGUMENT.,"While we, with vain officious pomp, prepare"
11725,THE ARGUMENT.,"To send him back his portion of the war,"
11726,THE ARGUMENT.,"A bloody breathless body, which can owe"
11727,THE ARGUMENT.,"No farther debt, but to the pow’rs below."
11728,THE ARGUMENT.,"The wretched father, ere his race is run,"
11729,THE ARGUMENT.,Shall view the fun’ral honours of his son.
11730,THE ARGUMENT.,"These are my triumphs of the Latian war,"
11731,THE ARGUMENT.,Fruits of my plighted faith and boasted care!
11732,THE ARGUMENT.,"And yet, unhappy sire, thou shalt not see"
11733,THE ARGUMENT.,A son whose death disgrac’d his ancestry;
11734,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thou shalt not blush, old man, however griev’d:"
11735,THE ARGUMENT.,Thy Pallas no dishonest wound receiv’d.
11736,THE ARGUMENT.,"He died no death to make thee wish, too late,"
11737,THE ARGUMENT.,Thou hadst not liv’d to see his shameful fate:
11738,THE ARGUMENT.,"But what a champion has th’ Ausonian coast,"
11739,THE ARGUMENT.,"And what a friend hast thou, Ascanius, lost!”"
11740,THE ARGUMENT.,
11741,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus having mourn’d, he gave the word around,"
11742,THE ARGUMENT.,To raise the breathless body from the ground;
11743,THE ARGUMENT.,"And chose a thousand horse, the flow’r of all"
11744,THE ARGUMENT.,"His warlike troops, to wait the funeral,"
11745,THE ARGUMENT.,To bear him back and share Evander’s grief:
11746,THE ARGUMENT.,"A well-becoming, but a weak relief."
11747,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of oaken twigs they twist an easy bier,"
11748,THE ARGUMENT.,Then on their shoulders the sad burden rear.
11749,THE ARGUMENT.,The body on this rural hearse is borne:
11750,THE ARGUMENT.,Strew’d leaves and funeral greens the bier adorn.
11751,THE ARGUMENT.,"All pale he lies, and looks a lovely flow’r,"
11752,THE ARGUMENT.,"New cropp’d by virgin hands, to dress the bow’r:"
11753,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unfaded yet, but yet unfed below,"
11754,THE ARGUMENT.,No more to mother earth or the green stern shall owe.
11755,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then two fair vests, of wondrous work and cost,"
11756,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of purple woven, and with gold emboss’d,"
11757,THE ARGUMENT.,"For ornament the Trojan hero brought,"
11758,THE ARGUMENT.,Which with her hands Sidonian Dido wrought.
11759,THE ARGUMENT.,One vest array’d the corpse; and one they spread
11760,THE ARGUMENT.,"O’er his clos’d eyes, and wrapp’d around his head,"
11761,THE ARGUMENT.,"That, when the yellow hair in flame should fall,"
11762,THE ARGUMENT.,The catching fire might burn the golden caul.
11763,THE ARGUMENT.,"Besides, the spoils of foes in battle slain,"
11764,THE ARGUMENT.,When he descended on the Latian plain;
11765,THE ARGUMENT.,"Arms, trappings, horses, by the hearse are led"
11766,THE ARGUMENT.,In long array—th’ achievements of the dead.
11767,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, pinion’d with their hands behind, appear"
11768,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ unhappy captives, marching in the rear,"
11769,THE ARGUMENT.,"Appointed off’rings in the victor’s name,"
11770,THE ARGUMENT.,To sprinkle with their blood the fun’ral flame.
11771,THE ARGUMENT.,Inferior trophies by the chiefs are borne;
11772,THE ARGUMENT.,Gauntlets and helms their loaded hands adorn;
11773,THE ARGUMENT.,"And fair inscriptions fix’d, and titles read"
11774,THE ARGUMENT.,Of Latian leaders conquer’d by the dead.
11775,THE ARGUMENT.,
11776,THE ARGUMENT.,"Acoetes on his pupil’s corpse attends,"
11777,THE ARGUMENT.,"With feeble steps, supported by his friends."
11778,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pausing at ev’ry pace, in sorrow drown’d,"
11779,THE ARGUMENT.,Betwixt their arms he sinks upon the ground;
11780,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where grov’ling while he lies in deep despair,"
11781,THE ARGUMENT.,"He beats his breast, and rends his hoary hair."
11782,THE ARGUMENT.,"The champion’s chariot next is seen to roll,"
11783,THE ARGUMENT.,"Besmear’d with hostile blood, and honourably foul."
11784,THE ARGUMENT.,"To close the pomp, Aethon, the steed of state,"
11785,THE ARGUMENT.,"Is led, the fun’rals of his lord to wait."
11786,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stripp’d of his trappings, with a sullen pace"
11787,THE ARGUMENT.,He walks; and the big tears run rolling down his face.
11788,THE ARGUMENT.,"The lance of Pallas, and the crimson crest,"
11789,THE ARGUMENT.,Are borne behind: the victor seiz’d the rest.
11790,THE ARGUMENT.,The march begins: the trumpets hoarsely sound;
11791,THE ARGUMENT.,The pikes and lances trail along the ground.
11792,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus while the Trojan and Arcadian horse
11793,THE ARGUMENT.,"To Pallantean tow’rs direct their course,"
11794,THE ARGUMENT.,"In long procession rank’d, the pious chief"
11795,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stopp’d in the rear, and gave a vent to grief:"
11796,THE ARGUMENT.,"“The public care,” he said, “which war attends,"
11797,THE ARGUMENT.,"Diverts our present woes, at least suspends."
11798,THE ARGUMENT.,Peace with the manes of great Pallas dwell!
11799,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hail, holy relics! and a last farewell!”"
11800,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said no more, but, inly thro’ he mourn’d,"
11801,THE ARGUMENT.,"Restrained his tears, and to the camp return’d."
11802,THE ARGUMENT.,
11803,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now suppliants, from Laurentum sent, demand"
11804,THE ARGUMENT.,"A truce, with olive branches in their hand;"
11805,THE ARGUMENT.,"Obtest his clemency, and from the plain"
11806,THE ARGUMENT.,Beg leave to draw the bodies of their slain.
11807,THE ARGUMENT.,"They plead, that none those common rites deny"
11808,THE ARGUMENT.,To conquer’d foes that in fair battle die.
11809,THE ARGUMENT.,All cause of hate was ended in their death;
11810,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor could he war with bodies void of breath.
11811,THE ARGUMENT.,"A king, they hop’d, would hear a king’s request,"
11812,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whose son he once was call’d, and once his guest."
11813,THE ARGUMENT.,
11814,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their suit, which was too just to be denied,"
11815,THE ARGUMENT.,"The hero grants, and farther thus replied:"
11816,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O Latian princes, how severe a fate"
11817,THE ARGUMENT.,"In causeless quarrels has involv’d your state,"
11818,THE ARGUMENT.,"And arm’d against an unoffending man,"
11819,THE ARGUMENT.,Who sought your friendship ere the war began!
11820,THE ARGUMENT.,"You beg a truce, which I would gladly give,"
11821,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not only for the slain, but those who live."
11822,THE ARGUMENT.,"I came not hither but by Heav’n’s command,"
11823,THE ARGUMENT.,And sent by fate to share the Latian land.
11824,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor wage I wars unjust: your king denied
11825,THE ARGUMENT.,"My proffer’d friendship, and my promis’d bride;"
11826,THE ARGUMENT.,Left me for Turnus. Turnus then should try
11827,THE ARGUMENT.,"His cause in arms, to conquer or to die."
11828,THE ARGUMENT.,My right and his are in dispute: the slain
11829,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fell without fault, our quarrel to maintain."
11830,THE ARGUMENT.,In equal arms let us alone contend;
11831,THE ARGUMENT.,"And let him vanquish, whom his fates befriend."
11832,THE ARGUMENT.,This is the way (so tell him) to possess
11833,THE ARGUMENT.,"The royal virgin, and restore the peace."
11834,THE ARGUMENT.,"Bear this message back, with ample leave,"
11835,THE ARGUMENT.,That your slain friends may fun’ral rites receive.”
11836,THE ARGUMENT.,
11837,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus having said—th’ embassadors, amaz’d,"
11838,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stood mute a while, and on each other gaz’d."
11839,THE ARGUMENT.,"Drances, their chief, who harbour’d in his breast"
11840,THE ARGUMENT.,"Long hate to Turnus, as his foe profess’d,"
11841,THE ARGUMENT.,"Broke silence first, and to the godlike man,"
11842,THE ARGUMENT.,"With graceful action bowing, thus began:"
11843,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Auspicious prince, in arms a mighty name,"
11844,THE ARGUMENT.,But yet whose actions far transcend your fame;
11845,THE ARGUMENT.,"Would I your justice or your force express,"
11846,THE ARGUMENT.,Thought can but equal; and all words are less.
11847,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your answer we shall thankfully relate,"
11848,THE ARGUMENT.,And favours granted to the Latian state.
11849,THE ARGUMENT.,"If wish’d success our labour shall attend,"
11850,THE ARGUMENT.,"Think peace concluded, and the king your friend:"
11851,THE ARGUMENT.,"Let Turnus leave the realm to your command,"
11852,THE ARGUMENT.,And seek alliance in some other land:
11853,THE ARGUMENT.,Build you the city which your fates assign;
11854,THE ARGUMENT.,We shall be proud in the great work to join.”
11855,THE ARGUMENT.,
11856,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus Drances; and his words so well persuade
11857,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rest impower’d, that soon a truce is made."
11858,THE ARGUMENT.,"Twelve days the term allow’d: and, during those,"
11859,THE ARGUMENT.,"Latians and Trojans, now no longer foes,"
11860,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mix’d in the woods, for fun’ral piles prepare"
11861,THE ARGUMENT.,"To fell the timber, and forget the war."
11862,THE ARGUMENT.,Loud axes thro’ the groaning groves resound;
11863,THE ARGUMENT.,"Oak, mountain ash, and poplar spread the ground;"
11864,THE ARGUMENT.,First fall from high; and some the trunks receive
11865,THE ARGUMENT.,In loaden wains; with wedges some they cleave.
11866,THE ARGUMENT.,
11867,THE ARGUMENT.,And now the fatal news by Fame is blown
11868,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thro’ the short circuit of th’ Arcadian town,"
11869,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of Pallas slain—by Fame, which just before"
11870,THE ARGUMENT.,His triumphs on distended pinions bore.
11871,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rushing from out the gate, the people stand,"
11872,THE ARGUMENT.,Each with a fun’ral flambeau in his hand.
11873,THE ARGUMENT.,"Wildly they stare, distracted with amaze:"
11874,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fields are lighten’d with a fiery blaze,"
11875,THE ARGUMENT.,"That cast a sullen splendour on their friends,"
11876,THE ARGUMENT.,The marching troop which their dead prince attends.
11877,THE ARGUMENT.,Both parties meet: they raise a doleful cry;
11878,THE ARGUMENT.,"The matrons from the walls with shrieks reply,"
11879,THE ARGUMENT.,And their mix’d mourning rends the vaulted sky.
11880,THE ARGUMENT.,"The town is fill’d with tumult and with tears,"
11881,THE ARGUMENT.,Till the loud clamours reach Evander’s ears:
11882,THE ARGUMENT.,"Forgetful of his state, he runs along,"
11883,THE ARGUMENT.,"With a disorder’d pace, and cleaves the throng;"
11884,THE ARGUMENT.,"Falls on the corpse; and groaning there he lies,"
11885,THE ARGUMENT.,"With silent grief, that speaks but at his eyes."
11886,THE ARGUMENT.,Short sighs and sobs succeed; till sorrow breaks
11887,THE ARGUMENT.,"A passage, and at once he weeps and speaks:"
11888,THE ARGUMENT.,
11889,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O Pallas! thou hast fail’d thy plighted word,"
11890,THE ARGUMENT.,"To fight with caution, not to tempt the sword!"
11891,THE ARGUMENT.,"I warn’d thee, but in vain; for well I knew"
11892,THE ARGUMENT.,"What perils youthful ardour would pursue,"
11893,THE ARGUMENT.,"That boiling blood would carry thee too far,"
11894,THE ARGUMENT.,"Young as thou wert in dangers, raw to war!"
11895,THE ARGUMENT.,"O curst essay of arms, disastrous doom,"
11896,THE ARGUMENT.,"Prelude of bloody fields, and fights to come!"
11897,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hard elements of unauspicious war,"
11898,THE ARGUMENT.,"Vain vows to Heav’n, and unavailing care!"
11899,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thrice happy thou, dear partner of my bed,"
11900,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whose holy soul the stroke of Fortune fled,"
11901,THE ARGUMENT.,"Prescious of ills, and leaving me behind,"
11902,THE ARGUMENT.,To drink the dregs of life by fate assign’d!
11903,THE ARGUMENT.,Beyond the goal of nature I have gone:
11904,THE ARGUMENT.,"My Pallas late set out, but reach’d too soon."
11905,THE ARGUMENT.,"If, for my league against th’ Ausonian state,"
11906,THE ARGUMENT.,"Amidst their weapons I had found my fate,"
11907,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Deserv’d from them,) then I had been return’d"
11908,THE ARGUMENT.,"A breathless victor, and my son had mourn’d."
11909,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet will I not my Trojan friend upbraid,"
11910,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor grudge th’ alliance I so gladly made.
11911,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Twas not his fault, my Pallas fell so young,"
11912,THE ARGUMENT.,"But my own crime, for having liv’d too long."
11913,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet, since the gods had destin’d him to die,"
11914,THE ARGUMENT.,At least he led the way to victory:
11915,THE ARGUMENT.,"First for his friends he won the fatal shore,"
11916,THE ARGUMENT.,And sent whole herds of slaughter’d foes before;
11917,THE ARGUMENT.,"A death too great, too glorious to deplore."
11918,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor will I add new honours to thy grave,"
11919,THE ARGUMENT.,Content with those the Trojan hero gave:
11920,THE ARGUMENT.,"That funeral pomp thy Phrygian friends design’d,"
11921,THE ARGUMENT.,In which the Tuscan chiefs and army join’d.
11922,THE ARGUMENT.,"Great spoils and trophies, gain’d by thee, they bear:"
11923,THE ARGUMENT.,Then let thy own achievements be thy share.
11924,THE ARGUMENT.,"Even thou, O Turnus, hadst a trophy stood,"
11925,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whose mighty trunk had better grac’d the wood,"
11926,THE ARGUMENT.,"If Pallas had arriv’d, with equal length"
11927,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of years, to match thy bulk with equal strength."
11928,THE ARGUMENT.,"But why, unhappy man, dost thou detain"
11929,THE ARGUMENT.,"These troops, to view the tears thou shedd’st in vain?"
11930,THE ARGUMENT.,"Go, friends, this message to your lord relate:"
11931,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tell him, that, if I bear my bitter fate,"
11932,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, after Pallas’ death, live ling’ring on,"
11933,THE ARGUMENT.,’Tis to behold his vengeance for my son.
11934,THE ARGUMENT.,"I stay for Turnus, whose devoted head"
11935,THE ARGUMENT.,Is owing to the living and the dead.
11936,THE ARGUMENT.,My son and I expect it from his hand;
11937,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Tis all that he can give, or we demand."
11938,THE ARGUMENT.,"Joy is no more; but I would gladly go,"
11939,THE ARGUMENT.,To greet my Pallas with such news below.”
11940,THE ARGUMENT.,
11941,THE ARGUMENT.,"The morn had now dispell’d the shades of night,"
11942,THE ARGUMENT.,"Restoring toils, when she restor’d the light."
11943,THE ARGUMENT.,The Trojan king and Tuscan chief command
11944,THE ARGUMENT.,To raise the piles along the winding strand.
11945,THE ARGUMENT.,Their friends convey the dead fun’ral fires;
11946,THE ARGUMENT.,Black smould’ring smoke from the green wood expires;
11947,THE ARGUMENT.,"The light of heav’n is chok’d, and the new day retires."
11948,THE ARGUMENT.,Then thrice around the kindled piles they go
11949,THE ARGUMENT.,(For ancient custom had ordain’d it so)
11950,THE ARGUMENT.,Thrice horse and foot about the fires are led;
11951,THE ARGUMENT.,"And thrice, with loud laments, they hail the dead."
11952,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tears, trickling down their breasts, bedew the ground,"
11953,THE ARGUMENT.,And drums and trumpets mix their mournful sound.
11954,THE ARGUMENT.,"Amid the blaze, their pious brethren throw"
11955,THE ARGUMENT.,"The spoils, in battle taken from the foe:"
11956,THE ARGUMENT.,"Helms, bits emboss’d, and swords of shining steel;"
11957,THE ARGUMENT.,"One casts a target, one a chariot wheel;"
11958,THE ARGUMENT.,Some to their fellows their own arms restore:
11959,THE ARGUMENT.,"The falchions which in luckless fight they bore,"
11960,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their bucklers pierc’d, their darts bestow’d in vain,"
11961,THE ARGUMENT.,And shiver’d lances gather’d from the plain.
11962,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whole herds of offer’d bulls, about the fire,"
11963,THE ARGUMENT.,"And bristled boars, and woolly sheep expire."
11964,THE ARGUMENT.,"Around the piles a careful troop attends,"
11965,THE ARGUMENT.,"To watch the wasting flames, and weep their burning friends;"
11966,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ling’ring along the shore, till dewy night"
11967,THE ARGUMENT.,New decks the face of heav’n with starry light.
11968,THE ARGUMENT.,
11969,THE ARGUMENT.,"The conquer’d Latians, with like pious care,"
11970,THE ARGUMENT.,Piles without number for their dead prepare.
11971,THE ARGUMENT.,Part in the places where they fell are laid;
11972,THE ARGUMENT.,And part are to the neighb’ring fields convey’d.
11973,THE ARGUMENT.,"The corps of kings, and captains of renown,"
11974,THE ARGUMENT.,"Borne off in state, are buried in the town;"
11975,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rest, unhonour’d, and without a name,"
11976,THE ARGUMENT.,Are cast a common heap to feed the flame.
11977,THE ARGUMENT.,Trojans and Latians vie with like desires
11978,THE ARGUMENT.,"To make the field of battle shine with fires,"
11979,THE ARGUMENT.,And the promiscuous blaze to heav’n aspires.
11980,THE ARGUMENT.,
11981,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now had the morning thrice renew’d the light,"
11982,THE ARGUMENT.,"And thrice dispell’d the shadows of the night,"
11983,THE ARGUMENT.,"When those who round the wasted fires remain,"
11984,THE ARGUMENT.,Perform the last sad office to the slain.
11985,THE ARGUMENT.,They rake the yet warm ashes from below;
11986,THE ARGUMENT.,"These, and the bones unburn’d, in earth bestow;"
11987,THE ARGUMENT.,"These relics with their country rites they grace,"
11988,THE ARGUMENT.,And raise a mount of turf to mark the place.
11989,THE ARGUMENT.,
11990,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, in the palace of the king, appears"
11991,THE ARGUMENT.,"A scene more solemn, and a pomp of tears."
11992,THE ARGUMENT.,"Maids, matrons, widows, mix their common moans;"
11993,THE ARGUMENT.,"Orphans their sires, and sires lament their sons."
11994,THE ARGUMENT.,"All in that universal sorrow share,"
11995,THE ARGUMENT.,And curse the cause of this unhappy war:
11996,THE ARGUMENT.,"A broken league, a bride unjustly sought,"
11997,THE ARGUMENT.,"A crown usurp’d, which with their blood is bought!"
11998,THE ARGUMENT.,These are the crimes with which they load the name
11999,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of Turnus, and on him alone exclaim:"
12000,THE ARGUMENT.,“Let him who lords it o’er th’ Ausonian land
12001,THE ARGUMENT.,Engage the Trojan hero hand to hand:
12002,THE ARGUMENT.,His is the gain; our lot is but to serve;
12003,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Tis just, the sway he seeks, he should deserve.”"
12004,THE ARGUMENT.,"This Drances aggravates; and adds, with spite:"
12005,THE ARGUMENT.,"“His foe expects, and dares him to the fight.”"
12006,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor Turnus wants a party, to support"
12007,THE ARGUMENT.,His cause and credit in the Latian court.
12008,THE ARGUMENT.,"His former acts secure his present fame,"
12009,THE ARGUMENT.,And the queen shades him with her mighty name.
12010,THE ARGUMENT.,
12011,THE ARGUMENT.,"While thus their factious minds with fury burn,"
12012,THE ARGUMENT.,The legates from th’ Aetolian prince return:
12013,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sad news they bring, that, after all the cost"
12014,THE ARGUMENT.,"And care employ’d, their embassy is lost;"
12015,THE ARGUMENT.,"That Diomedes refus’d his aid in war,"
12016,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unmov’d with presents, and as deaf to pray’r."
12017,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some new alliance must elsewhere be sought,"
12018,THE ARGUMENT.,Or peace with Troy on hard conditions bought.
12019,THE ARGUMENT.,
12020,THE ARGUMENT.,"Latinus, sunk in sorrow, finds too late,"
12021,THE ARGUMENT.,A foreign son is pointed out by fate;
12022,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, till Aeneas shall Lavinia wed,"
12023,THE ARGUMENT.,The wrath of Heav’n is hov’ring o’er his head.
12024,THE ARGUMENT.,"The gods, he saw, espous’d the juster side,"
12025,THE ARGUMENT.,When late their titles in the field were tried:
12026,THE ARGUMENT.,"Witness the fresh laments, and fun’ral tears undried."
12027,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus, full of anxious thought, he summons all"
12028,THE ARGUMENT.,The Latian senate to the council hall.
12029,THE ARGUMENT.,"The princes come, commanded by their head,"
12030,THE ARGUMENT.,And crowd the paths that to the palace lead.
12031,THE ARGUMENT.,"Supreme in pow’r, and reverenc’d for his years,"
12032,THE ARGUMENT.,"He takes the throne, and in the midst appears."
12033,THE ARGUMENT.,"Majestically sad, he sits in state,"
12034,THE ARGUMENT.,And bids his envoys their success relate.
12035,THE ARGUMENT.,
12036,THE ARGUMENT.,"When Venulus began, the murmuring sound"
12037,THE ARGUMENT.,"Was hush’d, and sacred silence reign’d around."
12038,THE ARGUMENT.,"“We have,” said he, “perform’d your high command,"
12039,THE ARGUMENT.,And pass’d with peril a long tract of land:
12040,THE ARGUMENT.,"We reach’d the place desir’d; with wonder fill’d,"
12041,THE ARGUMENT.,The Grecian tents and rising tow’rs beheld.
12042,THE ARGUMENT.,Great Diomede has compass’d round with walls
12043,THE ARGUMENT.,"The city, which Argyripa he calls,"
12044,THE ARGUMENT.,"From his own Argos nam’d. We touch’d, with joy,"
12045,THE ARGUMENT.,The royal hand that raz’d unhappy Troy.
12046,THE ARGUMENT.,"When introduc’d, our presents first we bring,"
12047,THE ARGUMENT.,Then crave an instant audience from the king.
12048,THE ARGUMENT.,"His leave obtain’d, our native soil we name,"
12049,THE ARGUMENT.,And tell th’ important cause for which we came.
12050,THE ARGUMENT.,"Attentively he heard us, while we spoke;"
12051,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, with soft accents, and a pleasing look,"
12052,THE ARGUMENT.,"Made this return: ‘Ausonian race, of old"
12053,THE ARGUMENT.,"Renown’d for peace, and for an age of gold,"
12054,THE ARGUMENT.,"What madness has your alter’d minds possess’d,"
12055,THE ARGUMENT.,"To change for war hereditary rest,"
12056,THE ARGUMENT.,"Solicit arms unknown, and tempt the sword,"
12057,THE ARGUMENT.,A needless ill your ancestors abhorr’d?
12058,THE ARGUMENT.,"We—for myself I speak, and all the name"
12059,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of Grecians, who to Troy’s destruction came,"
12060,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Omitting those who were in battle slain,"
12061,THE ARGUMENT.,Or borne by rolling Simois to the main)
12062,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not one but suffer’d, and too dearly bought"
12063,THE ARGUMENT.,The prize of honour which in arms he sought;
12064,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some doom’d to death, and some in exile driv’n."
12065,THE ARGUMENT.,"Outcasts, abandon’d by the care of Heav’n;"
12066,THE ARGUMENT.,"So worn, so wretched, so despis’d a crew,"
12067,THE ARGUMENT.,As ev’n old Priam might with pity view.
12068,THE ARGUMENT.,Witness the vessels by Minerva toss’d
12069,THE ARGUMENT.,In storms; the vengeful Capharean coast;
12070,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ Euboean rocks! the prince, whose brother led"
12071,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our armies to revenge his injur’d bed,"
12072,THE ARGUMENT.,In Egypt lost! Ulysses with his men
12073,THE ARGUMENT.,Have seen Charybdis and the Cyclops’ den.
12074,THE ARGUMENT.,"Why should I name Idomeneus, in vain"
12075,THE ARGUMENT.,"Restor’d to scepters, and expell’d again?"
12076,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or young Achilles, by his rival slain?"
12077,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ev’n he, the King of Men, the foremost name"
12078,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of all the Greeks, and most renown’d by fame,"
12079,THE ARGUMENT.,"The proud revenger of another’s wife,"
12080,THE ARGUMENT.,Yet by his own adult’ress lost his life;
12081,THE ARGUMENT.,Fell at his threshold; and the spoils of Troy
12082,THE ARGUMENT.,The foul polluters of his bed enjoy.
12083,THE ARGUMENT.,"The gods have envied me the sweets of life,"
12084,THE ARGUMENT.,"My much lov’d country, and my more lov’d wife:"
12085,THE ARGUMENT.,"Banish’d from both, I mourn; while in the sky,"
12086,THE ARGUMENT.,"Transform’d to birds, my lost companions fly:"
12087,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hov’ring about the coasts, they make their moan,"
12088,THE ARGUMENT.,And cuff the cliffs with pinions not their own.
12089,THE ARGUMENT.,"What squalid spectres, in the dead of night,"
12090,THE ARGUMENT.,"Break my short sleep, and skim before my sight!"
12091,THE ARGUMENT.,"I might have promis’d to myself those harms,"
12092,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mad as I was, when I, with mortal arms,"
12093,THE ARGUMENT.,"Presum’d against immortal pow’rs to move,"
12094,THE ARGUMENT.,And violate with wounds the Queen of Love.
12095,THE ARGUMENT.,Such arms this hand shall never more employ;
12096,THE ARGUMENT.,No hate remains with me to ruin’d Troy.
12097,THE ARGUMENT.,I war not with its dust; nor am I glad
12098,THE ARGUMENT.,"To think of past events, or good or bad."
12099,THE ARGUMENT.,Your presents I return: whate’er you bring
12100,THE ARGUMENT.,"To buy my friendship, send the Trojan king."
12101,THE ARGUMENT.,"We met in fight; I know him, to my cost:"
12102,THE ARGUMENT.,With what a whirling force his lance he toss’d!
12103,THE ARGUMENT.,"Heav’ns! what a spring was in his arm, to throw!"
12104,THE ARGUMENT.,"How high he held his shield, and rose at ev’ry blow!"
12105,THE ARGUMENT.,"Had Troy produc’d two more his match in might,"
12106,THE ARGUMENT.,They would have chang’d the fortune of the fight:
12107,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ invasion of the Greeks had been return’d,"
12108,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our empire wasted, and our cities burn’d."
12109,THE ARGUMENT.,"The long defence the Trojan people made,"
12110,THE ARGUMENT.,"The war protracted, and the siege delay’d,"
12111,THE ARGUMENT.,Were due to Hector’s and this hero’s hand:
12112,THE ARGUMENT.,"Both brave alike, and equal in command;"
12113,THE ARGUMENT.,"Aeneas, not inferior in the field,"
12114,THE ARGUMENT.,In pious reverence to the gods excell’d.
12115,THE ARGUMENT.,"Make peace, ye Latians, and avoid with care"
12116,THE ARGUMENT.,Th’ impending dangers of a fatal war.’
12117,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said no more; but, with this cold excuse,"
12118,THE ARGUMENT.,"Refus’d th’ alliance, and advis’d a truce.”"
12119,THE ARGUMENT.,
12120,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus Venulus concluded his report.
12121,THE ARGUMENT.,A jarring murmur fill’d the factious court:
12122,THE ARGUMENT.,"As, when a torrent rolls with rapid force,"
12123,THE ARGUMENT.,"And dashes o’er the stones that stop the course,"
12124,THE ARGUMENT.,"The flood, constrain’d within a scanty space,"
12125,THE ARGUMENT.,Roars horrible along th’ uneasy race;
12126,THE ARGUMENT.,White foam in gath’ring eddies floats around;
12127,THE ARGUMENT.,The rocky shores rebellow to the sound.
12128,THE ARGUMENT.,
12129,THE ARGUMENT.,The murmur ceas’d: then from his lofty throne
12130,THE ARGUMENT.,"The king invok’d the gods, and thus begun:"
12131,THE ARGUMENT.,"“I wish, ye Latins, what we now debate"
12132,THE ARGUMENT.,Had been resolv’d before it was too late.
12133,THE ARGUMENT.,"Much better had it been for you and me,"
12134,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unforc’d by this our last necessity,"
12135,THE ARGUMENT.,"To have been earlier wise, than now to call"
12136,THE ARGUMENT.,"A council, when the foe surrounds the wall."
12137,THE ARGUMENT.,"O citizens, we wage unequal war,"
12138,THE ARGUMENT.,"With men not only Heav’n’s peculiar care,"
12139,THE ARGUMENT.,"But Heav’n’s own race; unconquer’d in the field,"
12140,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or, conquer’d, yet unknowing how to yield."
12141,THE ARGUMENT.,"What hopes you had in Diomedes, lay down:"
12142,THE ARGUMENT.,Our hopes must centre on ourselves alone.
12143,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet those how feeble, and, indeed, how vain,"
12144,THE ARGUMENT.,You see too well; nor need my words explain.
12145,THE ARGUMENT.,Vanquish’d without resource; laid flat by fate;
12146,THE ARGUMENT.,"Factions within, a foe without the gate!"
12147,THE ARGUMENT.,Not but I grant that all perform’d their parts
12148,THE ARGUMENT.,"With manly force, and with undaunted hearts:"
12149,THE ARGUMENT.,With our united strength the war we wag’d;
12150,THE ARGUMENT.,"With equal numbers, equal arms, engag’d."
12151,THE ARGUMENT.,"You see th’ event.—Now hear what I propose,"
12152,THE ARGUMENT.,"To save our friends, and satisfy our foes."
12153,THE ARGUMENT.,A tract of land the Latins have possess’d
12154,THE ARGUMENT.,"Along the Tiber, stretching to the west,"
12155,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which now Rutulians and Auruncans till,"
12156,THE ARGUMENT.,And their mix’d cattle graze the fruitful hill.
12157,THE ARGUMENT.,"Those mountains fill’d with firs, that lower land,"
12158,THE ARGUMENT.,"If you consent, the Trojan shall command,"
12159,THE ARGUMENT.,"Call’d into part of what is ours; and there,"
12160,THE ARGUMENT.,"On terms agreed, the common country share."
12161,THE ARGUMENT.,"There let them build and settle, if they please;"
12162,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unless they choose once more to cross the seas,"
12163,THE ARGUMENT.,"In search of seats remote from Italy,"
12164,THE ARGUMENT.,And from unwelcome inmates set us free.
12165,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then twice ten galleys let us build with speed,"
12166,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or twice as many more, if more they need."
12167,THE ARGUMENT.,Materials are at hand; a well-grown wood
12168,THE ARGUMENT.,Runs equal with the margin of the flood:
12169,THE ARGUMENT.,Let them the number and the form assign;
12170,THE ARGUMENT.,The care and cost of all the stores be mine.
12171,THE ARGUMENT.,"To treat the peace, a hundred senators"
12172,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shall be commission’d hence with ample pow’rs,"
12173,THE ARGUMENT.,"With olive the presents they shall bear,"
12174,THE ARGUMENT.,"A purple robe, a royal iv’ry chair,"
12175,THE ARGUMENT.,"And all the marks of sway that Latian monarchs wear,"
12176,THE ARGUMENT.,And sums of gold. Among yourselves debate
12177,THE ARGUMENT.,"This great affair, and save the sinking state.”"
12178,THE ARGUMENT.,
12179,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Drances took the word, who grudg’d, long since,"
12180,THE ARGUMENT.,The rising glories of the Daunian prince.
12181,THE ARGUMENT.,"Factious and rich, bold at the council board,"
12182,THE ARGUMENT.,"But cautious in the field, he shunn’d the sword;"
12183,THE ARGUMENT.,"A close caballer, and tongue-valiant lord."
12184,THE ARGUMENT.,"Noble his mother was, and near the throne;"
12185,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, what his father’s parentage, unknown."
12186,THE ARGUMENT.,"He rose, and took th’ advantage of the times,"
12187,THE ARGUMENT.,To load young Turnus with invidious crimes.
12188,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Such truths, O king,” said he, “your words contain,"
12189,THE ARGUMENT.,"As strike the sense, and all replies are vain;"
12190,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor are your loyal subjects now to seek
12191,THE ARGUMENT.,"What common needs require, but fear to speak."
12192,THE ARGUMENT.,"Let him give leave of speech, that haughty man,"
12193,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose pride this unauspicious war began;
12194,THE ARGUMENT.,"For whose ambition (let me dare to say,"
12195,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fear set apart, tho’ death is in my way)"
12196,THE ARGUMENT.,The plains of Latium run with blood around.
12197,THE ARGUMENT.,So many valiant heroes bite the ground;
12198,THE ARGUMENT.,Dejected grief in ev’ry face appears;
12199,THE ARGUMENT.,"A town in mourning, and a land in tears;"
12200,THE ARGUMENT.,"While he, th’ undoubted author of our harms,"
12201,THE ARGUMENT.,"The man who menaces the gods with arms,"
12202,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet, after all his boasts, forsook the fight,"
12203,THE ARGUMENT.,And sought his safety in ignoble flight.
12204,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, best of kings, since you propose to send"
12205,THE ARGUMENT.,Such bounteous presents to your Trojan friend;
12206,THE ARGUMENT.,"Add yet a greater at our joint request,"
12207,THE ARGUMENT.,One which he values more than all the rest:
12208,THE ARGUMENT.,Give him the fair Lavinia for his bride;
12209,THE ARGUMENT.,"With that alliance let the league be tied,"
12210,THE ARGUMENT.,And for the bleeding land a lasting peace provide.
12211,THE ARGUMENT.,Let insolence no longer awe the throne;
12212,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, with a father’s right, bestow your own."
12213,THE ARGUMENT.,"For this maligner of the general good,"
12214,THE ARGUMENT.,"If still we fear his force, he must be woo’d;"
12215,THE ARGUMENT.,"His haughty godhead we with pray’rs implore,"
12216,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your scepter to release, and our just rights restore."
12217,THE ARGUMENT.,"O cursed cause of all our ills, must we"
12218,THE ARGUMENT.,"Wage wars unjust, and fall in fight, for thee!"
12219,THE ARGUMENT.,"What right hast thou to rule the Latian state,"
12220,THE ARGUMENT.,And send us out to meet our certain fate?
12221,THE ARGUMENT.,’Tis a destructive war: from Turnus’ hand
12222,THE ARGUMENT.,Our peace and public safety we demand.
12223,THE ARGUMENT.,Let the fair bride to the brave chief remain;
12224,THE ARGUMENT.,"If not, the peace, without the pledge, is vain."
12225,THE ARGUMENT.,"Turnus, I know you think me not your friend,"
12226,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor will I much with your belief contend:
12227,THE ARGUMENT.,I beg your greatness not to give the law
12228,THE ARGUMENT.,"In others’ realms, but, beaten, to withdraw."
12229,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pity your own, or pity our estate;"
12230,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor twist our fortunes with your sinking fate.
12231,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your interest is, the war should never cease;"
12232,THE ARGUMENT.,But we have felt enough to wish the peace:
12233,THE ARGUMENT.,"A land exhausted to the last remains,"
12234,THE ARGUMENT.,"Depopulated towns, and driven plains."
12235,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet, if desire of fame, and thirst of pow’r,"
12236,THE ARGUMENT.,"A beauteous princess, with a crown in dow’r,"
12237,THE ARGUMENT.,"So fire your mind, in arms assert your right,"
12238,THE ARGUMENT.,"And meet your foe, who dares you to the fight."
12239,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mankind, it seems, is made for you alone;"
12240,THE ARGUMENT.,"We, but the slaves who mount you to the throne:"
12241,THE ARGUMENT.,"A base ignoble crowd, without a name,"
12242,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unwept, unworthy, of the fun’ral flame,"
12243,THE ARGUMENT.,"By duty bound to forfeit each his life,"
12244,THE ARGUMENT.,That Turnus may possess a royal wife.
12245,THE ARGUMENT.,"Permit not, mighty man, so mean a crew"
12246,THE ARGUMENT.,"Should share such triumphs, and detain from you"
12247,THE ARGUMENT.,"The post of honour, your undoubted due."
12248,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rather alone your matchless force employ,"
12249,THE ARGUMENT.,To merit what alone you must enjoy.”
12250,THE ARGUMENT.,
12251,THE ARGUMENT.,"These words, so full of malice mix’d with art,"
12252,THE ARGUMENT.,Inflam’d with rage the youthful hero’s heart.
12253,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, groaning from the bottom of his breast,"
12254,THE ARGUMENT.,"He heav’d for wind, and thus his wrath express’d:"
12255,THE ARGUMENT.,"“You, Drances, never want a stream of words,"
12256,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, when the public need requires our swords."
12257,THE ARGUMENT.,"First in the council hall to steer the state,"
12258,THE ARGUMENT.,"And ever foremost in a tongue-debate,"
12259,THE ARGUMENT.,"While our strong walls secure us from the foe,"
12260,THE ARGUMENT.,Ere yet with blood our ditches overflow:
12261,THE ARGUMENT.,"But let the potent orator declaim,"
12262,THE ARGUMENT.,And with the brand of coward blot my name;
12263,THE ARGUMENT.,"Free leave is giv’n him, when his fatal hand"
12264,THE ARGUMENT.,"Has cover’d with more corps the sanguine strand,"
12265,THE ARGUMENT.,And high as mine his tow’ring trophies stand.
12266,THE ARGUMENT.,"If any doubt remains, who dares the most,"
12267,THE ARGUMENT.,"Let us decide it at the Trojan’s cost,"
12268,THE ARGUMENT.,"And issue both abreast, where honour calls—"
12269,THE ARGUMENT.,(Foes are not far to seek without the walls)
12270,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unless his noisy tongue can only fight,"
12271,THE ARGUMENT.,And feet were giv’n him but to speed his flight.
12272,THE ARGUMENT.,I beaten from the field? I forc’d away?
12273,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who, but so known a dastard, dares to say?"
12274,THE ARGUMENT.,"Had he but ev’n beheld the fight, his eyes"
12275,THE ARGUMENT.,Had witness’d for me what his tongue denies:
12276,THE ARGUMENT.,"What heaps of Trojans by this hand were slain,"
12277,THE ARGUMENT.,And how the bloody Tiber swell’d the main.
12278,THE ARGUMENT.,"All saw, but he, th’ Arcadian troops retire"
12279,THE ARGUMENT.,"In scatter’d squadrons, and their prince expire."
12280,THE ARGUMENT.,"The giant brothers, in their camp, have found,"
12281,THE ARGUMENT.,I was not forc’d with ease to quit my ground.
12282,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not such the Trojans tried me, when, inclos’d,"
12283,THE ARGUMENT.,I singly their united arms oppos’d:
12284,THE ARGUMENT.,First forc’d an entrance thro’ their thick array;
12285,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, glutted with their slaughter, freed my way."
12286,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Tis a destructive war? So let it be,"
12287,THE ARGUMENT.,"But to the Phrygian pirate, and to thee!"
12288,THE ARGUMENT.,Meantime proceed to fill the people’s ears
12289,THE ARGUMENT.,"With false reports, their minds with panic fears:"
12290,THE ARGUMENT.,Extol the strength of a twice-conquer’d race;
12291,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our foes encourage, and our friends debase."
12292,THE ARGUMENT.,"Believe thy fables, and the Trojan town"
12293,THE ARGUMENT.,Triumphant stands; the Grecians are o’erthrown;
12294,THE ARGUMENT.,"Suppliant at Hector’s feet Achilles lies,"
12295,THE ARGUMENT.,And Diomede from fierce Aeneas flies.
12296,THE ARGUMENT.,Say rapid Aufidus with awful dread
12297,THE ARGUMENT.,"Runs backward from the sea, and hides his head,"
12298,THE ARGUMENT.,When the great Trojan on his bank appears;
12299,THE ARGUMENT.,For that’s as true as thy dissembled fears
12300,THE ARGUMENT.,Of my revenge. Dismiss that vanity:
12301,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thou, Drances, art below a death from me."
12302,THE ARGUMENT.,Let that vile soul in that vile body rest;
12303,THE ARGUMENT.,The lodging is well worthy of the guest.
12304,THE ARGUMENT.,
12305,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Now, royal father, to the present state"
12306,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of our affairs, and of this high debate:"
12307,THE ARGUMENT.,"If in your arms thus early you diffide,"
12308,THE ARGUMENT.,And think your fortune is already tried;
12309,THE ARGUMENT.,"If one defeat has brought us down so low,"
12310,THE ARGUMENT.,As never more in fields to meet the foe;
12311,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then I conclude for peace: ’tis time to treat,"
12312,THE ARGUMENT.,And lie like vassals at the victor’s feet.
12313,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, O! if any ancient blood remains,"
12314,THE ARGUMENT.,"One drop of all our fathers’, in our veins,"
12315,THE ARGUMENT.,"That man would I prefer before the rest,"
12316,THE ARGUMENT.,Who dar’d his death with an undaunted breast;
12317,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who comely fell, by no dishonest wound,"
12318,THE ARGUMENT.,"To shun that sight, and, dying, gnaw’d the ground."
12319,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, if we still have fresh recruits in store,"
12320,THE ARGUMENT.,If our confederates can afford us more;
12321,THE ARGUMENT.,"If the contended field we bravely fought,"
12322,THE ARGUMENT.,And not a bloodless victory was bought;
12323,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their losses equal’d ours; and, for their slain,"
12324,THE ARGUMENT.,With equal fires they fill’d the shining plain;
12325,THE ARGUMENT.,"Why thus, unforc’d, should we so tamely yield,"
12326,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, ere the trumpet sounds, resign the field?"
12327,THE ARGUMENT.,"Good unexpected, evils unforeseen,"
12328,THE ARGUMENT.,"Appear by turns, as fortune shifts the scene:"
12329,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some, rais’d aloft, come tumbling down amain;"
12330,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then fall so hard, they bound and rise again."
12331,THE ARGUMENT.,"If Diomede refuse his aid to lend,"
12332,THE ARGUMENT.,The great Messapus yet remains our friend:
12333,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tolumnius, who foretells events, is ours;"
12334,THE ARGUMENT.,Th’ Italian chiefs and princes join their pow’rs:
12335,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor least in number, nor in name the last,"
12336,THE ARGUMENT.,Your own brave subjects have your cause embrac’d
12337,THE ARGUMENT.,"Above the rest, the Volscian Amazon"
12338,THE ARGUMENT.,"Contains an army in herself alone,"
12339,THE ARGUMENT.,"And heads a squadron, terrible to sight,"
12340,THE ARGUMENT.,"With glitt’ring shields, in brazen armour bright."
12341,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet, if the foe a single fight demand,"
12342,THE ARGUMENT.,And I alone the public peace withstand;
12343,THE ARGUMENT.,"If you consent, he shall not be refus’d,"
12344,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor find a hand to victory unus’d.
12345,THE ARGUMENT.,"This new Achilles, let him take the field,"
12346,THE ARGUMENT.,"With fated armour, and Vulcanian shield!"
12347,THE ARGUMENT.,"For you, my royal father, and my fame,"

12353,THE ARGUMENT.,
12354,THE ARGUMENT.,"While they debate, nor these nor those will yield,"
12355,THE ARGUMENT.,"Aeneas draws his forces to the field,"
12356,THE ARGUMENT.,And moves his camp. The scouts with flying speed
12357,THE ARGUMENT.,"Return, and thro’ the frighted city spread"
12358,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ unpleasing news, the Trojans are descried,"
12359,THE ARGUMENT.,"In battle marching by the river side,"
12360,THE ARGUMENT.,And bending to the town. They take th’ alarm:
12361,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some tremble, some are bold; all in confusion arm."
12362,THE ARGUMENT.,Th’ impetuous youth press forward to the field;
12363,THE ARGUMENT.,"They clash the sword, and clatter on the shield:"
12364,THE ARGUMENT.,The fearful matrons raise a screaming cry;
12365,THE ARGUMENT.,Old feeble men with fainter groans reply;
12366,THE ARGUMENT.,"A jarring sound results, and mingles in the sky,"
12367,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like that of swans remurm’ring to the floods,"
12368,THE ARGUMENT.,Or birds of diff’ring kinds in hollow woods.
12369,THE ARGUMENT.,
12370,THE ARGUMENT.,"Turnus th’ occasion takes, and cries aloud:"

12374,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said, and, turning short, with speedy pace,"
12375,THE ARGUMENT.,"Casts back a scornful glance, and quits the place:"
12376,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Thou, Volusus, the Volscian troops command"

12382,THE ARGUMENT.,
12383,THE ARGUMENT.,"They swarm from ev’ry quarter of the town,"

12385,THE ARGUMENT.,"Good old Latinus, when he saw, too late,"
12386,THE ARGUMENT.,"The gath’ring storm just breaking on the state,"

12391,THE ARGUMENT.,
12392,THE ARGUMENT.,Some help to sink new trenches; others aid

12394,THE ARGUMENT.,Hoarse trumpets sound th’ alarm; around the walls
12395,THE ARGUMENT.,"Runs a distracted crew, whom their last labour calls."
12396,THE ARGUMENT.,"A sad procession in the streets is seen,"
12397,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of matrons, that attend the mother queen:"
12398,THE ARGUMENT.,"High in her chair she sits, and, at her side,"
12399,THE ARGUMENT.,"With downcast eyes, appears the fatal bride."
12400,THE ARGUMENT.,"They mount the cliff, where Pallas’ temple stands;"
12401,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pray’rs in their mouths, and presents in their hands,"
12402,THE ARGUMENT.,"With censers first they fume the sacred shrine,"
12403,THE ARGUMENT.,Then in this common supplication join:
12404,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O patroness of arms, unspotted maid,"
12405,THE ARGUMENT.,"Propitious hear, and lend thy Latins aid!"
12406,THE ARGUMENT.,"Break short the pirate’s lance; pronounce his fate,"
12407,THE ARGUMENT.,And lay the Phrygian low before the gate.”
12408,THE ARGUMENT.,
12409,THE ARGUMENT.,Now Turnus arms for fight. His back and breast
12410,THE ARGUMENT.,Well-temper’d steel and scaly brass invest:
12411,THE ARGUMENT.,The cuishes which his brawny thighs infold
12412,THE ARGUMENT.,Are mingled metal damask’d o’er with gold.
12413,THE ARGUMENT.,His faithful falchion sits upon his side;
12414,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor casque, nor crest, his manly features hide:"
12415,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, bare to view, amid surrounding friends,"
12416,THE ARGUMENT.,"With godlike grace, he from the tow’r descends."
12417,THE ARGUMENT.,"Exulting in his strength, he seems to dare"
12418,THE ARGUMENT.,"His absent rival, and to promise war."
12419,THE ARGUMENT.,"Freed from his keepers, thus, with broken reins,"
12420,THE ARGUMENT.,"The wanton courser prances o’er the plains,"
12421,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or in the pride of youth o’erleaps the mounds,"
12422,THE ARGUMENT.,And snuffs the females in forbidden grounds.
12423,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or seeks his wat’ring in the well-known flood,"
12424,THE ARGUMENT.,"To quench his thirst, and cool his fiery blood:"
12425,THE ARGUMENT.,"He swims luxuriant in the liquid plain,"
12426,THE ARGUMENT.,And o’er his shoulder flows his waving mane:
12427,THE ARGUMENT.,"He neighs, he snorts, he bears his head on high;"
12428,THE ARGUMENT.,Before his ample chest the frothy waters fly.
12429,THE ARGUMENT.,
12430,THE ARGUMENT.,"Soon as the prince appears without the gate,"
12431,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Volscians, with their virgin leader, wait"
12432,THE ARGUMENT.,"His last commands. Then, with a graceful mien,"
12433,THE ARGUMENT.,Lights from her lofty steed the warrior queen:
12434,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her squadron imitates, and each descends;"
12435,THE ARGUMENT.,Whose common suit Camilla thus commends:
12436,THE ARGUMENT.,"“If sense of honour, if a soul secure"
12437,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of inborn worth, that can all tests endure,"
12438,THE ARGUMENT.,"Can promise aught, or on itself rely"
12439,THE ARGUMENT.,"Greatly to dare, to conquer or to die;"
12440,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, I alone, sustain’d by these, will meet"
12441,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Tyrrhene troops, and promise their defeat."
12442,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ours be the danger, ours the sole renown:"
12443,THE ARGUMENT.,"You, gen’ral, stay behind, and guard the town.”"
12444,THE ARGUMENT.,
12445,THE ARGUMENT.,"Turnus a while stood mute, with glad surprise,"
12446,THE ARGUMENT.,And on the fierce Virago fix’d his eyes;
12447,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then thus return’d: “O grace of Italy,"
12448,THE ARGUMENT.,With what becoming thanks can I reply?
12449,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not only words lie lab’ring in my breast,"
12450,THE ARGUMENT.,But thought itself is by thy praise oppress’d.
12451,THE ARGUMENT.,Yet rob me not of all; but let me join
12452,THE ARGUMENT.,"My toils, my hazard, and my fame, with thine."
12453,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojan, not in stratagem unskill’d,"
12454,THE ARGUMENT.,Sends his light horse before to scour the field:
12455,THE ARGUMENT.,"Himself, thro’ steep ascents and thorny brakes,"
12456,THE ARGUMENT.,A larger compass to the city takes.
12457,THE ARGUMENT.,"This news my scouts confirm, and I prepare"
12458,THE ARGUMENT.,"To foil his cunning, and his force to dare;"
12459,THE ARGUMENT.,"With chosen foot his passage to forelay,"
12460,THE ARGUMENT.,And place an ambush in the winding way.
12461,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thou, with thy Volscians, face the Tuscan horse;"
12462,THE ARGUMENT.,The brave Messapus shall thy troops enforce
12463,THE ARGUMENT.,"With those of Tibur, and the Latian band,"
12464,THE ARGUMENT.,Subjected all to thy supreme command.”
12465,THE ARGUMENT.,"This said, he warns Messapus to the war,"
12466,THE ARGUMENT.,Then ev’ry chief exhorts with equal care.
12467,THE ARGUMENT.,"All thus encourag’d, his own troops he joins,"
12468,THE ARGUMENT.,And hastes to prosecute his deep designs.
12469,THE ARGUMENT.,
12470,THE ARGUMENT.,"Inclos’d with hills, a winding valley lies,"
12471,THE ARGUMENT.,"By nature form’d for fraud, and fitted for surprise."
12472,THE ARGUMENT.,"A narrow track, by human steps untrode,"
12473,THE ARGUMENT.,"Leads, thro’ perplexing thorns, to this obscure abode."
12474,THE ARGUMENT.,"High o’er the vale a steepy mountain stands,"
12475,THE ARGUMENT.,Whence the surveying sight the nether ground commands.
12476,THE ARGUMENT.,"The top is level, an offensive seat"
12477,THE ARGUMENT.,Of war; and from the war a safe retreat:
12478,THE ARGUMENT.,"For, on the right and left, is room to press"
12479,THE ARGUMENT.,"The foes at hand, or from afar distress;"
12480,THE ARGUMENT.,"To drive ’em headlong downward, and to pour"
12481,THE ARGUMENT.,On their descending backs a stony show’r.
12482,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thither young Turnus took the well-known way,"
12483,THE ARGUMENT.,"Possess’d the pass, and in blind ambush lay."
12484,THE ARGUMENT.,
12485,THE ARGUMENT.,"Meantime Latonian Phoebe, from the skies,"
12486,THE ARGUMENT.,"Beheld th’ approaching war with hateful eyes,"
12487,THE ARGUMENT.,"And call’d the light-foot Opis to her aid,"
12488,THE ARGUMENT.,Her most belov’d and ever-trusty maid;
12489,THE ARGUMENT.,Then with a sigh began: “Camilla goes
12490,THE ARGUMENT.,To meet her death amidst her fatal foes:
12491,THE ARGUMENT.,"The nymphs I lov’d of all my mortal train,"
12492,THE ARGUMENT.,"Invested with Diana’s arms, in vain."
12493,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor is my kindness for the virgin new:
12494,THE ARGUMENT.,’Twas born with her; and with her years it grew.
12495,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her father Metabus, when forc’d away"
12496,THE ARGUMENT.,"From old Privernum, for tyrannic sway,"
12497,THE ARGUMENT.,"Snatch’d up, and sav’d from his prevailing foes,"
12498,THE ARGUMENT.,"This tender babe, companion of his woes."
12499,THE ARGUMENT.,Casmilla was her mother; but he drown’d
12500,THE ARGUMENT.,"One hissing letter in a softer sound,"
12501,THE ARGUMENT.,And call’d Camilla. Thro’ the woods he flies;
12502,THE ARGUMENT.,Wrapp’d in his robe the royal infant lies.
12503,THE ARGUMENT.,"His foes in sight, he mends his weary pace;"
12504,THE ARGUMENT.,With shout and clamours they pursue the chase.
12505,THE ARGUMENT.,The banks of Amasene at length he gains:
12506,THE ARGUMENT.,
12507,THE ARGUMENT.,"The raging flood his farther flight restrains,"
12508,THE ARGUMENT.,Rais’d o’er the borders with unusual rains.
12509,THE ARGUMENT.,"Prepar’d to plunge into the stream, he fears,"
12510,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not for himself, but for the charge he bears."
12511,THE ARGUMENT.,"Anxious, he stops a while, and thinks in haste;"
12512,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, desp’rate in distress, resolves at last."
12513,THE ARGUMENT.,A knotty lance of well-boil’d oak he bore;
12514,THE ARGUMENT.,The middle part with cork he cover’d o’er:
12515,THE ARGUMENT.,He clos’d the child within the hollow space;
12516,THE ARGUMENT.,With twigs of bending osier bound the case;
12517,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then pois’d the spear, heavy with human weight,"
12518,THE ARGUMENT.,And thus invok’d my favour for the freight:
12519,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘Accept, great goddess of the woods,’ he said,"
12520,THE ARGUMENT.,"‘Sent by her sire, this dedicated maid!"
12521,THE ARGUMENT.,Thro’ air she flies a suppliant to thy shrine;
12522,THE ARGUMENT.,"And the first weapons that she knows, are thine.’"
12523,THE ARGUMENT.,He said; and with full force the spear he threw:
12524,THE ARGUMENT.,Above the sounding waves Camilla flew.
12525,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, press’d by foes, he stemm’d the stormy tide,"
12526,THE ARGUMENT.,"And gain’d, by stress of arms, the farther side."
12527,THE ARGUMENT.,"His fasten’d spear he pull’d from out the ground,"
12528,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, victor of his vows, his infant nymph unbound;"
12529,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor, after that, in towns which walls inclose,"
12530,THE ARGUMENT.,Would trust his hunted life amidst his foes;
12531,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, rough, in open air he chose to lie;"
12532,THE ARGUMENT.,"Earth was his couch, his cov’ring was the sky."
12533,THE ARGUMENT.,"On hills unshorn, or in a desert den,"
12534,THE ARGUMENT.,He shunn’d the dire society of men.
12535,THE ARGUMENT.,A shepherd’s solitary life he led;
12536,THE ARGUMENT.,His daughter with the milk of mares he fed.
12537,THE ARGUMENT.,"The dugs of bears, and ev’ry salvage beast,"
12538,THE ARGUMENT.,"He drew, and thro’ her lips the liquor press’d."
12539,THE ARGUMENT.,The little Amazon could scarcely go:
12540,THE ARGUMENT.,He loads her with a quiver and a bow;
12541,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, that she might her stagg’ring steps command,"
12542,THE ARGUMENT.,He with a slender jav’lin fills her hand.
12543,THE ARGUMENT.,Her flowing hair no golden fillet bound;
12544,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor swept her trailing robe the dusty ground.
12545,THE ARGUMENT.,"Instead of these, a tiger’s hide o’erspread"
12546,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her back and shoulders, fasten’d to her head."
12547,THE ARGUMENT.,"The flying dart she first attempts to fling,"
12548,THE ARGUMENT.,And round her tender temples toss’d the sling;
12549,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, as her strength with years increas’d, began"
12550,THE ARGUMENT.,"To pierce aloft in air the soaring swan,"
12551,THE ARGUMENT.,And from the clouds to fetch the heron and the crane.
12552,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Tuscan matrons with each other vied,"
12553,THE ARGUMENT.,To bless their rival sons with such a bride;
12554,THE ARGUMENT.,"But she disdains their love, to share with me"
12555,THE ARGUMENT.,The sylvan shades and vow’d virginity.
12556,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, O! I wish, contented with my cares"
12557,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of salvage spoils, she had not sought the wars!"
12558,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then had she been of my celestial train,"
12559,THE ARGUMENT.,And shunn’d the fate that dooms her to be slain.
12560,THE ARGUMENT.,"But since, opposing Heav’n’s decree, she goes"
12561,THE ARGUMENT.,"To find her death among forbidden foes,"
12562,THE ARGUMENT.,"Haste with these arms, and take thy steepy flight."
12563,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where, with the gods, averse, the Latins fight."
12564,THE ARGUMENT.,"This bow to thee, this quiver I bequeath,"
12565,THE ARGUMENT.,"This chosen arrow, to revenge her death:"
12566,THE ARGUMENT.,"By whate’er hand Camilla shall be slain,"
12567,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or of the Trojan or Italian train,"
12568,THE ARGUMENT.,Let him not pass unpunish’d from the plain.
12569,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, in a hollow cloud, myself will aid"
12570,THE ARGUMENT.,To bear the breathless body of my maid:
12571,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unspoil’d shall be her arms, and unprofan’d"
12572,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her holy limbs with any human hand,"
12573,THE ARGUMENT.,And in a marble tomb laid in her native land.”
12574,THE ARGUMENT.,
12575,THE ARGUMENT.,She said. The faithful nymph descends from high
12576,THE ARGUMENT.,"With rapid flight, and cuts the sounding sky:"
12577,THE ARGUMENT.,Black clouds and stormy winds around her body fly.
12578,THE ARGUMENT.,
12579,THE ARGUMENT.,"By this, the Trojan and the Tuscan horse,"
12580,THE ARGUMENT.,"Drawn up in squadrons, with united force,"
12581,THE ARGUMENT.,"Approach the walls: the sprightly coursers bound,"
12582,THE ARGUMENT.,"Press forward on their bits, and shift their ground."
12583,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shields, arms, and spears flash horribly from far;"
12584,THE ARGUMENT.,And the fields glitter with a waving war.
12585,THE ARGUMENT.,"Oppos’d to these, come on with furious force"
12586,THE ARGUMENT.,"Messapus, Coras, and the Latian horse;"
12587,THE ARGUMENT.,"These in the body plac’d, on either hand"
12588,THE ARGUMENT.,Sustain’d and clos’d by fair Camilla’s band.
12589,THE ARGUMENT.,"Advancing in a line, they couch their spears;"
12590,THE ARGUMENT.,And less and less the middle space appears.
12591,THE ARGUMENT.,Thick smoke obscures the field; and scarce are seen
12592,THE ARGUMENT.,"The neighing coursers, and the shouting men."
12593,THE ARGUMENT.,In distance of their darts they stop their course;
12594,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then man to man they rush, and horse to horse."
12595,THE ARGUMENT.,"The face of heav’n their flying jav’lins hide,"
12596,THE ARGUMENT.,And deaths unseen are dealt on either side.
12597,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tyrrhenus, and Aconteus, void of fear,"
12598,THE ARGUMENT.,"By mettled coursers borne in full career,"
12599,THE ARGUMENT.,"Meet first oppos’d; and, with a mighty shock,"
12600,THE ARGUMENT.,Their horses’ heads against each other knock.
12601,THE ARGUMENT.,"Far from his steed is fierce Aconteus cast,"
12602,THE ARGUMENT.,"As with an engine’s force, or lightning’s blast:"
12603,THE ARGUMENT.,"He rolls along in blood, and breathes his last."
12604,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Latin squadrons take a sudden fright,"
12605,THE ARGUMENT.,"And sling their shields behind, to save their backs in flight"
12606,THE ARGUMENT.,Spurring at speed to their own walls they drew;
12607,THE ARGUMENT.,"Close in the rear the Tuscan troops pursue,"
12608,THE ARGUMENT.,And urge their flight: Asylas leads the chase;
12609,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till, seiz’d, with shame, they wheel about and face,"
12610,THE ARGUMENT.,"Receive their foes, and raise a threat’ning cry."
12611,THE ARGUMENT.,The Tuscans take their turn to fear and fly.
12612,THE ARGUMENT.,"So swelling surges, with a thund’ring roar,"
12613,THE ARGUMENT.,"Driv’n on each other’s backs, insult the shore,"
12614,THE ARGUMENT.,"Bound o’er the rocks, incroach upon the land,"
12615,THE ARGUMENT.,And far upon the beach eject the sand;
12616,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then backward, with a swing, they take their way,"
12617,THE ARGUMENT.,"Repuls’d from upper ground, and seek their mother sea;"
12618,THE ARGUMENT.,"With equal hurry quit th’ invaded shore,"
12619,THE ARGUMENT.,And swallow back the sand and stones they spew’d before.
12620,THE ARGUMENT.,
12621,THE ARGUMENT.,"Twice were the Tuscans masters of the field,"
12622,THE ARGUMENT.,"Twice by the Latins, in their turn, repell’d."
12623,THE ARGUMENT.,"Asham’d at length, to the third charge they ran;"
12624,THE ARGUMENT.,"Both hosts resolv’d, and mingled man to man."
12625,THE ARGUMENT.,Now dying groans are heard; the fields are strow’d
12626,THE ARGUMENT.,"With falling bodies, and are drunk with blood."
12627,THE ARGUMENT.,"Arms, horses, men, on heaps together lie:"
12628,THE ARGUMENT.,"Confus’d the fight, and more confus’d the cry."
12629,THE ARGUMENT.,"Orsilochus, who durst not press too near"
12630,THE ARGUMENT.,"Strong Remulus, at distance drove his spear,"
12631,THE ARGUMENT.,And stuck the steel beneath his horse’s ear.
12632,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fiery steed, impatient of the wound,"
12633,THE ARGUMENT.,"Curvets, and, springing upward with a bound,"
12634,THE ARGUMENT.,His helpless lord cast backward on the ground.
12635,THE ARGUMENT.,Catillus pierc’d Iolas first; then drew
12636,THE ARGUMENT.,"His reeking lance, and at Herminius threw,"
12637,THE ARGUMENT.,The mighty champion of the Tuscan crew.
12638,THE ARGUMENT.,"His neck and throat unarm’d, his head was bare,"
12639,THE ARGUMENT.,But shaded with a length of yellow hair:
12640,THE ARGUMENT.,"Secure, he fought, expos’d on ev’ry part,"
12641,THE ARGUMENT.,"A spacious mark for swords, and for the flying dart."
12642,THE ARGUMENT.,Across the shoulders came the feather’d wound;
12643,THE ARGUMENT.,"Transfix’d he fell, and doubled to the ground."
12644,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sands with streaming blood are sanguine dyed,"
12645,THE ARGUMENT.,And death with honour sought on either side.
12646,THE ARGUMENT.,
12647,THE ARGUMENT.,"Resistless thro’ the war Camilla rode,"
12648,THE ARGUMENT.,"In danger unappall’d, and pleas’d with blood."
12649,THE ARGUMENT.,One side was bare for her exerted breast;
12650,THE ARGUMENT.,One shoulder with her painted quiver press’d.
12651,THE ARGUMENT.,Now from afar her fatal jav’lins play;
12652,THE ARGUMENT.,Now with her ax’s edge she hews her way:
12653,THE ARGUMENT.,Diana’s arms upon her shoulder sound;
12654,THE ARGUMENT.,"And when, too closely press’d, she quits the ground,"
12655,THE ARGUMENT.,From her bent bow she sends a backward wound.
12656,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her maids, in martial pomp, on either side,"
12657,THE ARGUMENT.,"Larina, Tulla, fierce Tarpeia, ride:"
12658,THE ARGUMENT.,"Italians all; in peace, their queen’s delight;"
12659,THE ARGUMENT.,"In war, the bold companions of the fight."
12660,THE ARGUMENT.,"So march’d the Thracian Amazons of old,"
12661,THE ARGUMENT.,When Thermodon with bloody billows roll’d:
12662,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such troops as these in shining arms were seen,"
12663,THE ARGUMENT.,When Theseus met in fight their maiden queen:
12664,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such to the field Penthesilea led,"
12665,THE ARGUMENT.,From the fierce virgin when the Grecians fled;
12666,THE ARGUMENT.,"With such, return’d triumphant from the war,"
12667,THE ARGUMENT.,Her maids with cries attend the lofty car;
12668,THE ARGUMENT.,They clash with manly force their moony shields;
12669,THE ARGUMENT.,With female shouts resound the Phrygian fields.
12670,THE ARGUMENT.,
12671,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who foremost, and who last, heroic maid,"
12672,THE ARGUMENT.,On the cold earth were by thy courage laid?
12673,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thy spear, of mountain ash, Eumenius first,"
12674,THE ARGUMENT.,"With fury driv’n, from side to side transpierc’d:"
12675,THE ARGUMENT.,A purple stream came spouting from the wound;
12676,THE ARGUMENT.,"Bath’d in his blood he lies, and bites the ground."
12677,THE ARGUMENT.,Liris and Pegasus at once she slew:
12678,THE ARGUMENT.,"The former, as the slacken’d reins he drew"
12679,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of his faint steed; the latter, as he stretch’d"
12680,THE ARGUMENT.,"His arm to prop his friend, the jav’lin reach’d."
12681,THE ARGUMENT.,"By the same weapon, sent from the same hand,"
12682,THE ARGUMENT.,"Both fall together, and both spurn the sand."
12683,THE ARGUMENT.,Amastrus next is added to the slain:
12684,THE ARGUMENT.,The rest in rout she follows o’er the plain:
12685,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tereus, Harpalycus, Demophoon,"
12686,THE ARGUMENT.,"And Chromis, at full speed her fury shun."
12687,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of all her deadly darts, not one she lost;"
12688,THE ARGUMENT.,Each was attended with a Trojan ghost.
12689,THE ARGUMENT.,"Young Ornithus bestrode a hunter steed,"
12690,THE ARGUMENT.,"Swift for the chase, and of Apulian breed."
12691,THE ARGUMENT.,"Him from afar she spied, in arms unknown:"
12692,THE ARGUMENT.,O’er his broad back an ox’s hide was thrown;
12693,THE ARGUMENT.,"His helm a wolf, whose gaping jaws were spread"
12694,THE ARGUMENT.,"A cov’ring for his cheeks, and grinn’d around his head,"
12695,THE ARGUMENT.,"He clench’d within his hand an iron prong,"
12696,THE ARGUMENT.,"And tower’d above the rest, conspicuous in the throng."
12697,THE ARGUMENT.,"Him soon she singled from the flying train,"
12698,THE ARGUMENT.,And slew with ease; then thus insults the slain:
12699,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Vain hunter, didst thou think thro’ woods to chase"
12700,THE ARGUMENT.,"The savage herd, a vile and trembling race?"
12701,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here cease thy vaunts, and own my victory:"
12702,THE ARGUMENT.,A woman warrior was too strong for thee.
12703,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet, if the ghosts demand the conqu’ror’s name,"
12704,THE ARGUMENT.,"Confessing great Camilla, save thy shame.”"
12705,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Butes and Orsilochus she slew,"
12706,THE ARGUMENT.,The bulkiest bodies of the Trojan crew;
12707,THE ARGUMENT.,But Butes breast to breast: the spear descends
12708,THE ARGUMENT.,"Above the gorget, where his helmet ends,"
12709,THE ARGUMENT.,And o’er the shield which his left side defends.
12710,THE ARGUMENT.,Orsilochus and she their courses ply:
12711,THE ARGUMENT.,"He seems to follow, and she seems to fly;"
12712,THE ARGUMENT.,But in a narrower ring she makes the race;
12713,THE ARGUMENT.,"And then he flies, and she pursues the chase."
12714,THE ARGUMENT.,"Gath’ring at length on her deluded foe,"
12715,THE ARGUMENT.,"She swings her ax, and rises to the blow"
12716,THE ARGUMENT.,"Full on the helm behind, with such a sway"
12717,THE ARGUMENT.,"The weapon falls, the riven steel gives way:"
12718,THE ARGUMENT.,"He groans, he roars, he sues in vain for grace;"
12719,THE ARGUMENT.,"Brains, mingled with his blood, besmear his face."
12720,THE ARGUMENT.,
12721,THE ARGUMENT.,"Astonish’d Aunus just arrives by chance,"
12722,THE ARGUMENT.,To see his fall; nor farther dares advance;
12723,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, fixing on the horrid maid his eye,"
12724,THE ARGUMENT.,"He stares, and shakes, and finds it vain to fly;"
12725,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet, like a true Ligurian, born to cheat,"
12726,THE ARGUMENT.,"(At least while fortune favour’d his deceit,)"
12727,THE ARGUMENT.,"Cries out aloud: “What courage have you shown,"
12728,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who trust your courser’s strength, and not your own?"
12729,THE ARGUMENT.,"Forego the vantage of your horse, alight,"
12730,THE ARGUMENT.,And then on equal terms begin the fight:
12731,THE ARGUMENT.,"It shall be seen, weak woman, what you can,"
12732,THE ARGUMENT.,"When, foot to foot, you combat with a man,”"
12733,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said. She glows with anger and disdain,"
12734,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dismounts with speed to dare him on the plain,"
12735,THE ARGUMENT.,And leaves her horse at large among her train;
12736,THE ARGUMENT.,"With her drawn sword defies him to the field,"
12737,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, marching, lifts aloft her maiden shield."
12738,THE ARGUMENT.,"The youth, who thought his cunning did succeed,"
12739,THE ARGUMENT.,"Reins round his horse, and urges all his speed;"
12740,THE ARGUMENT.,"Adds the remembrance of the spur, and hides"
12741,THE ARGUMENT.,The goring rowels in his bleeding sides.
12742,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Vain fool, and coward!” cries the lofty maid,"
12743,THE ARGUMENT.,“Caught in the train which thou thyself hast laid!
12744,THE ARGUMENT.,On others practice thy Ligurian arts;
12745,THE ARGUMENT.,Thin stratagems and tricks of little hearts
12746,THE ARGUMENT.,"Are lost on me: nor shalt thou safe retire,"
12747,THE ARGUMENT.,"With vaunting lies, to thy fallacious sire.”"
12748,THE ARGUMENT.,"At this, so fast her flying feet she sped,"
12749,THE ARGUMENT.,That soon she strain’d beyond his horse’s head:
12750,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then turning short, at once she seiz’d the rein,"
12751,THE ARGUMENT.,And laid the boaster grov’ling on the plain.
12752,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not with more ease the falcon, from above,"
12753,THE ARGUMENT.,"Trusses in middle air the trembling dove,"
12754,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then plumes the prey, in her strong pounces bound:"

12788,THE ARGUMENT.,"His jointed arms, to fix a deadly wound."
12789,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor less the captive struggles for his life:
12790,THE ARGUMENT.,"He writhes his body to prolong the strife,"
12791,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, fencing for his naked throat, exerts"
12792,THE ARGUMENT.,"His utmost vigour, and the point averts."
12793,THE ARGUMENT.,"So stoops the yellow eagle from on high,"
12794,THE ARGUMENT.,"And bears a speckled serpent thro’ the sky,"
12795,THE ARGUMENT.,Fast’ning his crooked talons on the prey:

12797,THE ARGUMENT.,"Resists the royal hawk; and, tho’ oppress’d,"
12798,THE ARGUMENT.,"She fights in volumes, and erects her crest:"
12799,THE ARGUMENT.,"Turn’d to her foe, she stiffens ev’ry scale,"

12821,THE ARGUMENT.,"Glitt’ring in Phrygian arms amidst the war,"
12822,THE ARGUMENT.,Was by the virgin view’d. The steed he press’d
12823,THE ARGUMENT.,"Was proud with trappings, and his brawny chest"
12824,THE ARGUMENT.,With scales of gilded brass was cover’d o’er;
12825,THE ARGUMENT.,A robe of Tyrian dye the rider wore.
12826,THE ARGUMENT.,With deadly wounds he gall’d the distant foe;
12827,THE ARGUMENT.,"Gnossian his shafts, and Lycian was his bow:"
12828,THE ARGUMENT.,A golden helm his front and head surrounds
12829,THE ARGUMENT.,A gilded quiver from his shoulder sounds.
12830,THE ARGUMENT.,"Gold, weav’d with linen, on his thighs he wore,"

12840,THE ARGUMENT.,This lucky moment the sly traitor chose:
12841,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, starting from his ambush, up he rose,"

12850,THE ARGUMENT.,The stains of this dishonourable day:
12851,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor spoils, nor triumph, from the fact I claim,"
12852,THE ARGUMENT.,But with my future actions trust my fame.
12853,THE ARGUMENT.,"Let me, by stealth, this female plague o’ercome,"
12854,THE ARGUMENT.,And from the field return inglorious home.”
12855,THE ARGUMENT.,"Apollo heard, and, granting half his pray’r,"
12856,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shuffled in winds the rest, and toss’d in empty air."
12857,THE ARGUMENT.,He gives the death desir’d; his safe return
12858,THE ARGUMENT.,By southern tempests to the seas is borne.

12860,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, when the jav’lin whizz’d along the skies,"
12861,THE ARGUMENT.,"Both armies on Camilla turn’d their eyes,"
12862,THE ARGUMENT.,"Directed by the sound. Of either host,"
12863,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ unhappy virgin, tho’ concern’d the most,"
12864,THE ARGUMENT.,Was only deaf; so greedy was she bent
12865,THE ARGUMENT.,"On golden spoils, and on her prey intent;"
12866,THE ARGUMENT.,Till in her pap the winged weapon stood
12867,THE ARGUMENT.,"Infix’d, and deeply drunk the purple blood."
12868,THE ARGUMENT.,Her sad attendants hasten to sustain
12869,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their dying lady, drooping on the plain."

12875,THE ARGUMENT.,"At unawares, or ranch’d a shepherd’s side,"
12876,THE ARGUMENT.,"Conscious of his audacious deed, he flies,"
12877,THE ARGUMENT.,And claps his quiv’ring tail between his thighs:
12878,THE ARGUMENT.,"So, speeding once, the wretch no more attends,"
12879,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, spurring forward, herds among his friends."
12880,THE ARGUMENT.,
12881,THE ARGUMENT.,"She wrench’d the jav’lin with her dying hands,"
12882,THE ARGUMENT.,But wedg’d within her breast the weapon stands;
12883,THE ARGUMENT.,"The wood she draws, the steely point remains;"
12884,THE ARGUMENT.,She staggers in her seat with agonizing pains:
12885,THE ARGUMENT.,"(A gath’ring mist o’erclouds her cheerful eyes,"

12893,THE ARGUMENT.,"Repel the Trojans, and the town relieve:"
12894,THE ARGUMENT.,Farewell! and in this kiss my parting breath receive.”
12895,THE ARGUMENT.,"She said, and, sliding, sunk upon the plain:"
12896,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dying, her open’d hand forsakes the rein;"
12897,THE ARGUMENT.,"Short, and more short, she pants; by slow degrees"
12898,THE ARGUMENT.,Her mind the passage from her body frees.
12899,THE ARGUMENT.,"She drops her sword; she nods her plumy crest,"
12900,THE ARGUMENT.,Her drooping head declining on her breast:

12903,THE ARGUMENT.,
12904,THE ARGUMENT.,"A shout, that struck the golden stars, ensued;"
12905,THE ARGUMENT.,Despair and rage the languish’d fight renew’d.
12906,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojan troops and Tuscans, in a line,"
12907,THE ARGUMENT.,Advance to charge; the mix’d Arcadians join.
12908,THE ARGUMENT.,
12909,THE ARGUMENT.,"But Cynthia’s maid, high seated, from afar"
12910,THE ARGUMENT.,"Surveys the field, and fortune of the war,"
12911,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unmov’d a while, till, prostrate on the plain,"
12912,THE ARGUMENT.,"Welt’ring in blood, she sees Camilla slain,"
12913,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, round her corpse, of friends and foes a fighting train."
12914,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, from the bottom of her breast, she drew"
12915,THE ARGUMENT.,"A mournful sigh, and these sad words ensue:"
12916,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Too dear a fine, ah, much lamented maid,"
12917,THE ARGUMENT.,"For warring with the Trojans, thou hast paid!"
12918,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor aught avail’d, in this unhappy strife,"
12919,THE ARGUMENT.,"Diana’s sacred arms, to save thy life."
12920,THE ARGUMENT.,Yet unreveng’d thy goddess will not leave
12921,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her vot’ry’s death, nor; with vain sorrow grieve."
12922,THE ARGUMENT.,"Branded the wretch, and be his name abhorr’d;"
12923,THE ARGUMENT.,But after ages shall thy praise record.
12924,THE ARGUMENT.,Th’ inglorious coward soon shall press the plain:
12925,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus vows thy queen, and thus the Fates ordain.”"
12926,THE ARGUMENT.,
12927,THE ARGUMENT.,"High o’er the field there stood a hilly mound,"
12928,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sacred the place, and spread with oaks around,"
12929,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where, in a marble tomb, Dercennus lay,"
12930,THE ARGUMENT.,A king that once in Latium bore the sway.
12931,THE ARGUMENT.,"The beauteous Opis thither bent her flight,"
12932,THE ARGUMENT.,To mark the traitor Aruns from the height.
12933,THE ARGUMENT.,"Him in refulgent arms she soon espied,"
12934,THE ARGUMENT.,Swoln with success; and loudly thus she cried:

12936,THE ARGUMENT.,"Turn like a man, at length, and meet thy fate."
12937,THE ARGUMENT.,"Charg’d with my message, to Camilla go,"
12938,THE ARGUMENT.,"And say I sent thee to the shades below,"
12939,THE ARGUMENT.,An honour undeserv’d from Cynthia’s bow.”
12940,THE ARGUMENT.,
12941,THE ARGUMENT.,"She said, and from her quiver chose with speed"
12942,THE ARGUMENT.,"The winged shaft, predestin’d for the deed;"
12943,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then to the stubborn yew her strength applied,"
12944,THE ARGUMENT.,Till the far distant horns approach’d on either side.
12945,THE ARGUMENT.,"The bowstring touch’d her breast, so strong she drew;"
12946,THE ARGUMENT.,Whizzing in air the fatal arrow flew.
12947,THE ARGUMENT.,At once the twanging bow and sounding dart
12948,THE ARGUMENT.,"The traitor heard, and felt the point within his heart."
12949,THE ARGUMENT.,"Him, beating with his heels in pangs of death,"
12950,THE ARGUMENT.,His flying friends to foreign fields bequeath.
12951,THE ARGUMENT.,"The conqu’ring damsel, with expanded wings,"
12952,THE ARGUMENT.,The welcome message to her mistress brings.
12953,THE ARGUMENT.,
12954,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their leader lost, the Volscians quit the field,"
12955,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, unsustain’d, the chiefs of Turnus yield."
12956,THE ARGUMENT.,"The frighted soldiers, when their captains fly,"
12957,THE ARGUMENT.,More on their speed than on their strength rely.
12958,THE ARGUMENT.,"Confus’d in flight, they bear each other down,"
12959,THE ARGUMENT.,And spur their horses headlong to the town.
12960,THE ARGUMENT.,"Driv’n by their foes, and to their fears resign’d,"
12961,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not once they turn, but take their wounds behind."
12962,THE ARGUMENT.,"These drop the shield, and those the lance forego,"
12963,THE ARGUMENT.,Or on their shoulders bear the slacken’d bow.

12965,THE ARGUMENT.,"Beat short and thick, and shake the rotten ground."
12966,THE ARGUMENT.,"Black clouds of dust come rolling in the sky,"

12969,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rend heav’n with female shrieks, and wring their hands."
12970,THE ARGUMENT.,"All pressing on, pursuers and pursued,"

12972,THE ARGUMENT.,Some happy few escape: the throng too late
12973,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rush on for entrance, till they choke the gate."
12974,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ev’n in the sight of home, the wretched sire"
12975,THE ARGUMENT.,"Looks on, and sees his helpless son expire."
12976,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, in a fright, the folding gates they close,"

12982,THE ARGUMENT.,
12983,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Latian virgins, valiant with despair,"
12984,THE ARGUMENT.,"Arm’d on the tow’rs, the common danger share:"
12985,THE ARGUMENT.,So much of zeal their country’s cause inspir’d;
12986,THE ARGUMENT.,So much Camilla’s great example fir’d.
12987,THE ARGUMENT.,"Poles, sharpen’d in the flames, from high they throw,"
12988,THE ARGUMENT.,"With imitated darts, to gall the foe."
12989,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their lives for godlike freedom they bequeath,"
12990,THE ARGUMENT.,And crowd each other to be first in death.
12991,THE ARGUMENT.,"Meantime to Turnus, ambush’d in the shade,"
12992,THE ARGUMENT.,With heavy tidings came th’ unhappy maid:
12993,THE ARGUMENT.,"“The Volscians overthrown, Camilla kill’d;"
12994,THE ARGUMENT.,"The foes, entirely masters of the field,"
12995,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like a resistless flood, come rolling on:"
12996,THE ARGUMENT.,"The cry goes off the plain, and thickens to the town.”"
12997,THE ARGUMENT.,
12998,THE ARGUMENT.,"Inflam’d with rage, (for so the Furies fire"
12999,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Daunian’s breast, and so the Fates require,)"
13000,THE ARGUMENT.,"He leaves the hilly pass, the woods in vain"
13001,THE ARGUMENT.,"Possess’d, and downward issues on the plain."
13002,THE ARGUMENT.,"Scarce was he gone, when to the straits, now freed"
13003,THE ARGUMENT.,"From secret foes, the Trojan troops succeed."
13004,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thro’ the black forest and the ferny brake,"
13005,THE ARGUMENT.,"Unknowingly secure, their way they take;"
13006,THE ARGUMENT.,"From the rough mountains to the plain descend,"
13007,THE ARGUMENT.,"And there, in order drawn, their line extend."
13008,THE ARGUMENT.,Both armies now in open fields are seen;
13009,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor far the distance of the space between.
13010,THE ARGUMENT.,"Both to the city bend. Aeneas sees,"
13011,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thro’ smoking fields, his hast’ning enemies;"
13012,THE ARGUMENT.,"And Turnus views the Trojans in array,"
13013,THE ARGUMENT.,And hears th’ approaching horses proudly neigh.
13014,THE ARGUMENT.,Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join’d;
13015,THE ARGUMENT.,But westward to the sea the sun declin’d.
13016,THE ARGUMENT.,"Intrench’d before the town both armies lie,"

13120,THE ARGUMENT.,"But now the queen, who fear’d for Turnus’ life,"
13121,THE ARGUMENT.,"And loath’d the hard conditions of the strife,"
13122,THE ARGUMENT.,"Held him by force; and, dying in his death,"
13123,THE ARGUMENT.,In these sad accents gave her sorrow breath:
13124,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O Turnus, I adjure thee by these tears,"
13125,THE ARGUMENT.,And whate’er price Amata’s honour bears
13126,THE ARGUMENT.,"Within thy breast, since thou art all my hope,"
13127,THE ARGUMENT.,"My sickly mind’s repose, my sinking age’s prop;"
13128,THE ARGUMENT.,Since on the safety of thy life alone
13129,THE ARGUMENT.,"Depends Latinus, and the Latian throne:"
13130,THE ARGUMENT.,"Refuse me not this one, this only pray’r,"
13131,THE ARGUMENT.,"To waive the combat, and pursue the war."
13132,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whatever chance attends this fatal strife,"
13133,THE ARGUMENT.,"Think it includes, in thine, Amata’s life."
13134,THE ARGUMENT.,"I cannot live a slave, or see my throne"
13135,THE ARGUMENT.,Usurp’d by strangers or a Trojan son.”
13136,THE ARGUMENT.,
13137,THE ARGUMENT.,"At this, a flood of tears Lavinia shed;"
13138,THE ARGUMENT.,"A crimson blush her beauteous face o’erspread,"
13139,THE ARGUMENT.,Varying her cheeks by turns with white and red.
13140,THE ARGUMENT.,"The driving colours, never at a stay,"
13141,THE ARGUMENT.,"Run here and there, and flush, and fade away."
13142,THE ARGUMENT.,"Delightful change! Thus Indian iv’ry shows,"
13143,THE ARGUMENT.,Which with the bord’ring paint of purple glows;
13144,THE ARGUMENT.,Or lilies damask’d by the neighb’ring rose.
13145,THE ARGUMENT.,
13146,THE ARGUMENT.,"The lover gaz’d, and, burning with desire,"
13147,THE ARGUMENT.,"The more he look’d, the more he fed the fire:"
13148,THE ARGUMENT.,"Revenge, and jealous rage, and secret spite,"
13149,THE ARGUMENT.,"Roll in his breast, and rouse him to the fight."
13150,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then fixing on the queen his ardent eyes,"
13151,THE ARGUMENT.,"Firm to his first intent, he thus replies:"
13152,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O mother, do not by your tears prepare"
13153,THE ARGUMENT.,"Such boding omens, and prejudge the war."
13154,THE ARGUMENT.,"Resolv’d on fight, I am no longer free"
13155,THE ARGUMENT.,"To shun my death, if Heav’n my death decree.”"
13156,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then turning to the herald, thus pursues:"
13157,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Go, greet the Trojan with ungrateful news;"
13158,THE ARGUMENT.,"Denounce from me, that, when tomorrow’s light"
13159,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shall gild the heav’ns, he need not urge the fight;"
13160,THE ARGUMENT.,The Trojan and Rutulian troops no more
13161,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shall dye, with mutual blood, the Latian shore:"
13162,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our single swords the quarrel shall decide,"
13163,THE ARGUMENT.,And to the victor be the beauteous bride.”
13164,THE ARGUMENT.,
13165,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said, and striding on, with speedy pace,"
13166,THE ARGUMENT.,He sought his coursers of the Thracian race.
13167,THE ARGUMENT.,"At his approach they toss their heads on high,"
13168,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, proudly neighing, promise victory."
13169,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sires of these Orythia sent from far,"
13170,THE ARGUMENT.,"To grace Pilumnus, when he went to war."
13171,THE ARGUMENT.,"The drifts of Thracian snows were scarce so white,"
13172,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor northern winds in fleetness match’d their flight.
13173,THE ARGUMENT.,Officious grooms stand ready by his side;
13174,THE ARGUMENT.,"And some with combs their flowing manes divide,"
13175,THE ARGUMENT.,And others stroke their chests and gently soothe their pride.
13176,THE ARGUMENT.,
13177,THE ARGUMENT.,He sheath’d his limbs in arms; a temper’d mass
13178,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of golden metal those, and mountain brass."
13179,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then to his head his glitt’ring helm he tied,"
13180,THE ARGUMENT.,And girt his faithful falchion to his side.
13181,THE ARGUMENT.,"In his Aetnaean forge, the God of Fire"
13182,THE ARGUMENT.,That falchion labour’d for the hero’s sire;
13183,THE ARGUMENT.,"Immortal keenness on the blade bestow’d,"
13184,THE ARGUMENT.,And plung’d it hissing in the Stygian flood.
13185,THE ARGUMENT.,"Propp’d on a pillar, which the ceiling bore,"
13186,THE ARGUMENT.,Was plac’d the lance Auruncan Actor wore;
13187,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which with such force he brandish’d in his hand,"
13188,THE ARGUMENT.,The tough ash trembled like an osier wand:
13189,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then cried: “O pond’rous spoil of Actor slain,"
13190,THE ARGUMENT.,"And never yet by Turnus toss’d in vain,"
13191,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fail not this day thy wonted force; but go,"
13192,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sent by this hand, to pierce the Trojan foe!"
13193,THE ARGUMENT.,"Give me to tear his corslet from his breast,"
13194,THE ARGUMENT.,And from that eunuch head to rend the crest;
13195,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dragg’d in the dust, his frizzled hair to soil,"
13196,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hot from the vexing ir’n, and smear’d with fragrant oil!”"
13197,THE ARGUMENT.,
13198,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus while he raves, from his wide nostrils flies"
13199,THE ARGUMENT.,"A fiery steam, and sparkles from his eyes."
13200,THE ARGUMENT.,So fares the bull in his lov’d female’s sight:
13201,THE ARGUMENT.,"Proudly he bellows, and preludes the fight;"
13202,THE ARGUMENT.,"He tries his goring horns against a tree,"
13203,THE ARGUMENT.,And meditates his absent enemy;
13204,THE ARGUMENT.,He pushes at the winds; he digs the strand
13205,THE ARGUMENT.,"With his black hoofs, and spurns the yellow sand."
13206,THE ARGUMENT.,
13207,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor less the Trojan, in his Lemnian arms,"
13208,THE ARGUMENT.,To future fight his manly courage warms:
13209,THE ARGUMENT.,"He whets his fury, and with joy prepares"
13210,THE ARGUMENT.,To terminate at once the ling’ring wars;
13211,THE ARGUMENT.,"To cheer his chiefs and tender son, relates"
13212,THE ARGUMENT.,"What Heav’n had promis’d, and expounds the fates."
13213,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then to the Latian king he sends, to cease"
13214,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rage of arms, and ratify the peace."
13215,THE ARGUMENT.,
13216,THE ARGUMENT.,"The morn ensuing, from the mountain’s height,"
13217,THE ARGUMENT.,Had scarcely spread the skies with rosy light;
13218,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ ethereal coursers, bounding from the sea,"
13219,THE ARGUMENT.,From out their flaming nostrils breath’d the day;
13220,THE ARGUMENT.,"When now the Trojan and Rutulian guard,"
13221,THE ARGUMENT.,"In friendly labour join’d, the list prepar’d."
13222,THE ARGUMENT.,Beneath the walls they measure out the space;
13223,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then sacred altars rear, on sods of grass,"
13224,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where, with religious rites their common gods they place."
13225,THE ARGUMENT.,In purest white the priests their heads attire;
13226,THE ARGUMENT.,"And living waters bear, and holy fire;"
13227,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, o’er their linen hoods and shaded hair,"
13228,THE ARGUMENT.,Long twisted wreaths of sacred vervain wear.
13229,THE ARGUMENT.,
13230,THE ARGUMENT.,In order issuing from the town appears
13231,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Latin legion, arm’d with pointed spears;"
13232,THE ARGUMENT.,"And from the fields, advancing on a line,"
13233,THE ARGUMENT.,The Trojan and the Tuscan forces join:
13234,THE ARGUMENT.,Their various arms afford a pleasing sight;
13235,THE ARGUMENT.,"A peaceful train they seem, in peace prepar’d for fight."
13236,THE ARGUMENT.,"Betwixt the ranks the proud commanders ride,"
13237,THE ARGUMENT.,"Glitt’ring with gold, and vests in purple dyed;"
13238,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here Mnestheus, author of the Memmian line,"
13239,THE ARGUMENT.,"And there Messapus, born of seed divine."
13240,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sign is giv’n; and, round the listed space,"
13241,THE ARGUMENT.,Each man in order fills his proper place.
13242,THE ARGUMENT.,"Reclining on their ample shields, they stand,"
13243,THE ARGUMENT.,And fix their pointed lances in the sand.
13244,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, studious of the sight, a num’rous throng"
13245,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of either sex promiscuous, old and young,"
13246,THE ARGUMENT.,"Swarm the town: by those who rest behind,"
13247,THE ARGUMENT.,The gates and walls and houses’ tops are lin’d.
13248,THE ARGUMENT.,"Meantime the Queen of Heav’n beheld the sight,"
13249,THE ARGUMENT.,"With eyes unpleas’d, from Mount Albano’s height"
13250,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Since call’d Albano by succeeding fame,"
13251,THE ARGUMENT.,"But then an empty hill, without a name)."
13252,THE ARGUMENT.,"She thence survey’d the field, the Trojan pow’rs,"
13253,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Latian squadrons, and Laurentine tow’rs."
13254,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then thus the goddess of the skies bespoke,"
13255,THE ARGUMENT.,"With sighs and tears, the goddess of the lake,"
13256,THE ARGUMENT.,"King Turnus’ sister, once a lovely maid,"
13257,THE ARGUMENT.,Ere to the lust of lawless Jove betray’d:
13258,THE ARGUMENT.,"Compress’d by force, but, by the grateful god,"
13259,THE ARGUMENT.,Now made the Nais of the neighb’ring flood.
13260,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O nymph, the pride of living lakes,” said she,"
13261,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O most renown’d, and most belov’d by me,"
13262,THE ARGUMENT.,"Long hast thou known, nor need I to record,"
13263,THE ARGUMENT.,The wanton sallies of my wand’ring lord.
13264,THE ARGUMENT.,Of ev’ry Latian fair whom Jove misled
13265,THE ARGUMENT.,"To mount by stealth my violated bed,"
13266,THE ARGUMENT.,"To thee alone I grudg’d not his embrace,"
13267,THE ARGUMENT.,"But gave a part of heav’n, and an unenvied place."
13268,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now learn from me thy near approaching grief,"
13269,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor think my wishes want to thy relief.
13270,THE ARGUMENT.,"While fortune favour’d, nor Heav’n’s King denied"
13271,THE ARGUMENT.,"To lend my succour to the Latian side,"
13272,THE ARGUMENT.,"I sav’d thy brother, and the sinking state:"
13273,THE ARGUMENT.,"But now he struggles with unequal fate,"
13274,THE ARGUMENT.,"And goes, with gods averse, o’ermatch’d in might,"
13275,THE ARGUMENT.,To meet inevitable death in fight;
13276,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor must I break the truce, nor can sustain the sight."
13277,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thou, if thou dar’st thy present aid supply;"
13278,THE ARGUMENT.,It well becomes a sister’s care to try.”
13279,THE ARGUMENT.,
13280,THE ARGUMENT.,"At this the lovely nymph, with grief oppress’d,"
13281,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thrice tore her hair, and beat her comely breast."
13282,THE ARGUMENT.,To whom Saturnia thus: “Thy tears are late:
13283,THE ARGUMENT.,"Haste, snatch him, if he can be snatch’d from fate:"
13284,THE ARGUMENT.,New tumults kindle; violate the truce:
13285,THE ARGUMENT.,Who knows what changeful fortune may produce?
13286,THE ARGUMENT.,’Tis not a crime t’ attempt what I decree;
13287,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or, if it were, discharge the crime on me.”"
13288,THE ARGUMENT.,"She said, and, sailing on the winged wind,"
13289,THE ARGUMENT.,Left the sad nymph suspended in her mind.
13290,THE ARGUMENT.,
13291,THE ARGUMENT.,And now in pomp the peaceful kings appear:
13292,THE ARGUMENT.,Four steeds the chariot of Latinus bear;
13293,THE ARGUMENT.,"Twelve golden beams around his temples play,"
13294,THE ARGUMENT.,To mark his lineage from the God of Day.
13295,THE ARGUMENT.,"Two snowy coursers Turnus’ chariot yoke,"
13296,THE ARGUMENT.,And in his hand two massy spears he shook:
13297,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then issued from the camp, in arms divine,"
13298,THE ARGUMENT.,"Aeneas, author of the Roman line;"
13299,THE ARGUMENT.,"And by his side Ascanius took his place,"
13300,THE ARGUMENT.,The second hope of Rome’s immortal race.
13301,THE ARGUMENT.,"Adorn’d in white, a rev’rend priest appears,"
13302,THE ARGUMENT.,And off’rings to the flaming altars bears;
13303,THE ARGUMENT.,"A porket, and a lamb that never suffer’d shears."
13304,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then to the rising sun he turns his eyes,"
13305,THE ARGUMENT.,"And strews the beasts, design’d for sacrifice,"
13306,THE ARGUMENT.,With salt and meal: with like officious care
13307,THE ARGUMENT.,"He marks their foreheads, and he clips their hair."
13308,THE ARGUMENT.,Betwixt their horns the purple wine he sheds;
13309,THE ARGUMENT.,With the same gen’rous juice the flame he feeds.
13310,THE ARGUMENT.,
13311,THE ARGUMENT.,"Aeneas then unsheath’d his shining sword,"
13312,THE ARGUMENT.,And thus with pious pray’rs the gods ador’d:
13313,THE ARGUMENT.,"“All-seeing sun, and thou, Ausonian soil,"
13314,THE ARGUMENT.,"For which I have sustain’d so long a toil,"
13315,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thou, King of Heav’n, and thou, the Queen of Air,"
13316,THE ARGUMENT.,"Propitious now, and reconcil’d by pray’r;"
13317,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thou, God of War, whose unresisted sway"
13318,THE ARGUMENT.,The labours and events of arms obey;
13319,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ye living fountains, and ye running floods,"
13320,THE ARGUMENT.,"All pow’rs of ocean, all ethereal gods,"
13321,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hear, and bear record: if I fall in field,"
13322,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or, recreant in the fight, to Turnus yield,"
13323,THE ARGUMENT.,My Trojans shall encrease Evander’s town;
13324,THE ARGUMENT.,Ascanius shall renounce th’ Ausonian crown:
13325,THE ARGUMENT.,"All claims, all questions of debate, shall cease;"
13326,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor he, nor they, with force infringe the peace."
13327,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, if my juster arms prevail in fight,"
13328,THE ARGUMENT.,"(As sure they shall, if I divine aright,)"
13329,THE ARGUMENT.,My Trojans shall not o’er th’ Italians reign:
13330,THE ARGUMENT.,"Both equal, both unconquer’d shall remain,"
13331,THE ARGUMENT.,"Join’d in their laws, their lands, and their abodes;"
13332,THE ARGUMENT.,I ask but altars for my weary gods.
13333,THE ARGUMENT.,The care of those religious rites be mine;
13334,THE ARGUMENT.,The crown to King Latinus I resign:
13335,THE ARGUMENT.,His be the sov’reign sway. Nor will I share
13336,THE ARGUMENT.,"His pow’r in peace, or his command in war."
13337,THE ARGUMENT.,"For me, my friends another town shall frame,"
13338,THE ARGUMENT.,And bless the rising tow’rs with fair Lavinia’s name.”
13339,THE ARGUMENT.,
13340,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus he. Then, with erected eyes and hands,"
13341,THE ARGUMENT.,The Latian king before his altar stands.
13342,THE ARGUMENT.,"“By the same heav’n,” said he, “and earth, and main,"
13343,THE ARGUMENT.,And all the pow’rs that all the three contain;
13344,THE ARGUMENT.,"By hell below, and by that upper god"
13345,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whose thunder signs the peace, who seals it with his nod;"
13346,THE ARGUMENT.,"So let Latona’s double offspring hear,"
13347,THE ARGUMENT.,"And double-fronted Janus, what I swear:"
13348,THE ARGUMENT.,"I touch the sacred altars, touch the flames,"
13349,THE ARGUMENT.,"And all those pow’rs attest, and all their names;"
13350,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whatever chance befall on either side,"
13351,THE ARGUMENT.,No term of time this union shall divide:
13352,THE ARGUMENT.,"No force, no fortune, shall my vows unbind,"
13353,THE ARGUMENT.,Or shake the steadfast tenor of my mind;
13354,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not tho’ the circling seas should break their bound,"
13355,THE ARGUMENT.,"O’erflow the shores, or sap the solid ground;"
13356,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not tho’ the lamps of heav’n their spheres forsake,"
13357,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hurl’d down, and hissing in the nether lake:"
13358,THE ARGUMENT.,Ev’n as this royal scepter” (for he bore
13359,THE ARGUMENT.,A scepter in his hand) “shall never more
13360,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shoot out in branches, or renew the birth:"
13361,THE ARGUMENT.,"An orphan now, cut from the mother earth"
13362,THE ARGUMENT.,"By the keen ax, dishonour’d of its hair,"
13363,THE ARGUMENT.,"And cas’d in brass, for Latian kings to bear.”"
13364,THE ARGUMENT.,
13365,THE ARGUMENT.,When thus in public view the peace was tied
13366,THE ARGUMENT.,"With solemn vows, and sworn on either side,"
13367,THE ARGUMENT.,All dues perform’d which holy rites require;
13368,THE ARGUMENT.,"The victim beasts are slain before the fire,"
13369,THE ARGUMENT.,"The trembling entrails from their bodies torn,"
13370,THE ARGUMENT.,And to the fatten’d flames in chargers borne.
13371,THE ARGUMENT.,
13372,THE ARGUMENT.,Already the Rutulians deem their man
13373,THE ARGUMENT.,"O’ermatch’d in arms, before the fight began."
13374,THE ARGUMENT.,First rising fears are whisper’d thro’ the crowd;
13375,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, gath’ring sound, they murmur more aloud."
13376,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, side to side, they measure with their eyes"
13377,THE ARGUMENT.,"The champions’ bulk, their sinews, and their size:"
13378,THE ARGUMENT.,"The nearer they approach, the more is known"
13379,THE ARGUMENT.,Th’ apparent disadvantage of their own.
13380,THE ARGUMENT.,Turnus himself appears in public sight
13381,THE ARGUMENT.,"Conscious of fate, desponding of the fight."
13382,THE ARGUMENT.,"Slowly he moves, and at his altar stands"
13383,THE ARGUMENT.,"With eyes dejected, and with trembling hands;"
13384,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, while he mutters undistinguish’d pray’rs,"
13385,THE ARGUMENT.,A livid deadness in his cheeks appears.
13386,THE ARGUMENT.,
13387,THE ARGUMENT.,With anxious pleasure when Juturna view’d
13388,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ increasing fright of the mad multitude,"
13389,THE ARGUMENT.,"When their short sighs and thick’ning sobs she heard,"
13390,THE ARGUMENT.,And found their ready minds for change prepar’d;
13391,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dissembling her immortal form, she took"
13392,THE ARGUMENT.,"Camertus’ mien, his habit, and his look;"
13393,THE ARGUMENT.,A chief of ancient blood; in arms well known
13394,THE ARGUMENT.,"Was his great sire, and he his greater son."
13395,THE ARGUMENT.,"His shape assum’d, amid the ranks she ran,"
13396,THE ARGUMENT.,"And humoring their first motions, thus began:"
13397,THE ARGUMENT.,"“For shame, Rutulians, can you bear the sight"
13398,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of one expos’d for all, in single fight?"
13399,THE ARGUMENT.,"Can we, before the face of heav’n, confess"
13400,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our courage colder, or our numbers less?"
13401,THE ARGUMENT.,"View all the Trojan host, th’ Arcadian band,"
13402,THE ARGUMENT.,And Tuscan army; count ’em as they stand:
13403,THE ARGUMENT.,"Undaunted to the battle if we go,"
13404,THE ARGUMENT.,Scarce ev’ry second man will share a foe.
13405,THE ARGUMENT.,"Turnus, ’tis true, in this unequal strife,"
13406,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shall lose, with honour, his devoted life,"
13407,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or change it rather for immortal fame,"
13408,THE ARGUMENT.,"Succeeding to the gods, from whence he came:"
13409,THE ARGUMENT.,"But you, a servile and inglorious band,"
13410,THE ARGUMENT.,"For foreign lords shall sow your native land,"
13411,THE ARGUMENT.,"Those fruitful fields your fighting fathers gain’d,"
13412,THE ARGUMENT.,Which have so long their lazy sons sustain’d.”
13413,THE ARGUMENT.,"With words like these, she carried her design:"
13414,THE ARGUMENT.,A rising murmur runs along the line.
13415,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then ev’n the city troops, and Latians, tir’d"
13416,THE ARGUMENT.,"With tedious war, seem with new souls inspir’d:"
13417,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their champion’s fate with pity they lament,"
13418,THE ARGUMENT.,"And of the league, so lately sworn, repent."
13419,THE ARGUMENT.,
13420,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor fails the goddess to foment the rage
13421,THE ARGUMENT.,"With lying wonders, and a false presage;"
13422,THE ARGUMENT.,"But adds a sign, which, present to their eyes,"
13423,THE ARGUMENT.,"Inspires new courage, and a glad surprise."
13424,THE ARGUMENT.,"For, sudden, in the fiery tracts above,"
13425,THE ARGUMENT.,Appears in pomp th’ imperial bird of Jove:
13426,THE ARGUMENT.,"A plump of fowl he spies, that swim the lakes,"
13427,THE ARGUMENT.,And o’er their heads his sounding pinions shakes;
13428,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, stooping on the fairest of the train,"
13429,THE ARGUMENT.,In his strong talons truss’d a silver swan.
13430,THE ARGUMENT.,Th’ Italians wonder at th’ unusual sight;
13431,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, while he lags, and labours in his flight,"
13432,THE ARGUMENT.,"Behold, the dastard fowl return anew,"
13433,THE ARGUMENT.,And with united force the foe pursue:
13434,THE ARGUMENT.,"Clam’rous around the royal hawk they fly,"
13435,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, thick’ning in a cloud, o’ershade the sky."
13436,THE ARGUMENT.,"They cuff, they scratch, they cross his airy course;"
13437,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor can th’ incumber’d bird sustain their force;
13438,THE ARGUMENT.,"But vex’d, not vanquish’d, drops the pond’rous prey,"
13439,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, lighten’d of his burthen, wings his way."
13440,THE ARGUMENT.,
13441,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ Ausonian bands with shouts salute the sight,"
13442,THE ARGUMENT.,"Eager of action, and demand the fight."
13443,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then King Tolumnius, vers’d in augurs’ arts,"
13444,THE ARGUMENT.,"Cries out, and thus his boasted skill imparts:"
13445,THE ARGUMENT.,"“At length ’tis granted, what I long desir’d!"
13446,THE ARGUMENT.,"This, this is what my frequent vows requir’d."
13447,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ye gods, I take your omen, and obey."
13448,THE ARGUMENT.,"Advance, my friends, and charge! I lead the way."
13449,THE ARGUMENT.,"These are the foreign foes, whose impious band,"
13450,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like that rapacious bird, infest our land:"
13451,THE ARGUMENT.,"But soon, like him, they shall be forc’d to sea"
13452,THE ARGUMENT.,"By strength united, and forego the prey."
13453,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your timely succour to your country bring,"
13454,THE ARGUMENT.,"Haste to the rescue, and redeem your king.”"
13455,THE ARGUMENT.,
13456,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said; and, pressing onward thro’ the crew,"
13457,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pois’d in his lifted arm, his lance he threw."
13458,THE ARGUMENT.,"The winged weapon, whistling in the wind,"
13459,THE ARGUMENT.,"Came driving on, nor miss’d the mark design’d."
13460,THE ARGUMENT.,At once the cornel rattled in the skies;
13461,THE ARGUMENT.,At once tumultuous shouts and clamours rise.
13462,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nine brothers in a goodly band there stood,"
13463,THE ARGUMENT.,"Born of Arcadian mix’d with Tuscan blood,"
13464,THE ARGUMENT.,"Gylippus’ sons: the fatal jav’lin flew,"
13465,THE ARGUMENT.,Aim’d at the midmost of the friendly crew.
13466,THE ARGUMENT.,"A passage thro’ the jointed arms it found,"
13467,THE ARGUMENT.,"Just where the belt was to the body bound,"
13468,THE ARGUMENT.,And struck the gentle youth extended on the ground.
13469,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, fir’d with pious rage, the gen’rous train"
13470,THE ARGUMENT.,Run madly forward to revenge the slain.
13471,THE ARGUMENT.,And some with eager haste their jav’lins throw;
13472,THE ARGUMENT.,And some with sword in hand assault the foe.
13473,THE ARGUMENT.,
13474,THE ARGUMENT.,"The wish’d insult the Latine troops embrace,"
13475,THE ARGUMENT.,And meet their ardour in the middle space.
13476,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojans, Tuscans, and Arcadian line,"
13477,THE ARGUMENT.,With equal courage obviate their design.
13478,THE ARGUMENT.,"Peace leaves the violated fields, and hate"
13479,THE ARGUMENT.,Both armies urges to their mutual fate.
13480,THE ARGUMENT.,"With impious haste their altars are o’erturn’d,"
13481,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sacrifice half-broil’d, and half-unburn’d."
13482,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thick storms of steel from either army fly,"
13483,THE ARGUMENT.,And clouds of clashing darts obscure the sky;
13484,THE ARGUMENT.,"Brands from the fire are missive weapons made,"
13485,THE ARGUMENT.,"With chargers, bowls, and all the priestly trade."
13486,THE ARGUMENT.,"Latinus, frighted, hastens from the fray,"
13487,THE ARGUMENT.,And bears his unregarded gods away.
13488,THE ARGUMENT.,These on their horses vault; those yoke the car;
13489,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rest, with swords on high, run headlong to the war."
13490,THE ARGUMENT.,
13491,THE ARGUMENT.,"Messapus, eager to confound the peace,"
13492,THE ARGUMENT.,"Spurr’d his hot courser thro’ the fighting press,"
13493,THE ARGUMENT.,"At King Aulestes, by his purple known"
13494,THE ARGUMENT.,"A Tuscan prince, and by his regal crown;"
13495,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, with a shock encount’ring, bore him down."
13496,THE ARGUMENT.,"Backward he fell; and, as his fate design’d,"
13497,THE ARGUMENT.,The ruins of an altar were behind:
13498,THE ARGUMENT.,"There, pitching on his shoulders and his head,"
13499,THE ARGUMENT.,Amid the scatt’ring fires he lay supinely spread.
13500,THE ARGUMENT.,"The beamy spear, descending from above,"
13501,THE ARGUMENT.,"His cuirass pierc’d, and thro’ his body drove."
13502,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, with a scornful smile, the victor cries:"
13503,THE ARGUMENT.,“The gods have found a fitter sacrifice.”
13504,THE ARGUMENT.,"Greedy of spoils, th’ Italians strip the dead"
13505,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of his rich armour, and uncrown his head."
13506,THE ARGUMENT.,
13507,THE ARGUMENT.,"Priest Corynaeus, arm’d his better hand,"
13508,THE ARGUMENT.,"From his own altar, with a blazing brand;"
13509,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, as Ebusus with a thund’ring pace"
13510,THE ARGUMENT.,"Advanc’d to battle, dash’d it on his face:"
13511,THE ARGUMENT.,His bristly beard shines out with sudden fires;
13512,THE ARGUMENT.,The crackling crop a noisome scent expires.
13513,THE ARGUMENT.,"Following the blow, he seiz’d his curling crown"
13514,THE ARGUMENT.,With his left hand; his other cast him down.
13515,THE ARGUMENT.,"The prostrate body with his knees he press’d,"
13516,THE ARGUMENT.,And plung’d his holy poniard in his breast.
13517,THE ARGUMENT.,
13518,THE ARGUMENT.,"While Podalirius, with his sword, pursued"
13519,THE ARGUMENT.,"The shepherd Alsus thro’ the flying crowd,"
13520,THE ARGUMENT.,"Swiftly he turns, and aims a deadly blow"
13521,THE ARGUMENT.,Full on the front of his unwary foe.
13522,THE ARGUMENT.,"The broad ax enters with a crashing sound,"
13523,THE ARGUMENT.,And cleaves the chin with one continued wound;
13524,THE ARGUMENT.,"Warm blood, and mingled brains, besmear his arms around"
13525,THE ARGUMENT.,"An iron sleep his stupid eyes oppress’d,"
13526,THE ARGUMENT.,And seal’d their heavy lids in endless rest.
13527,THE ARGUMENT.,
13528,THE ARGUMENT.,But good Aeneas rush’d amid the bands;
13529,THE ARGUMENT.,"Bare was his head, and naked were his hands,"
13530,THE ARGUMENT.,In sign of truce: then thus he cries aloud:
13531,THE ARGUMENT.,"“What sudden rage, what new desire of blood,"
13532,THE ARGUMENT.,"Inflames your alter’d minds? O Trojans, cease"
13533,THE ARGUMENT.,"From impious arms, nor violate the peace!"
13534,THE ARGUMENT.,"By human sanctions, and by laws divine,"
13535,THE ARGUMENT.,The terms are all agreed; the war is mine.
13536,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dismiss your fears, and let the fight ensue;"
13537,THE ARGUMENT.,This hand alone shall right the gods and you:
13538,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our injur’d altars, and their broken vow,"
13539,THE ARGUMENT.,To this avenging sword the faithless Turnus owe.”
13540,THE ARGUMENT.,
13541,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus while he spoke, unmindful of defence,"
13542,THE ARGUMENT.,A winged arrow struck the pious prince.
13543,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, whether from some human hand it came,"
13544,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or hostile god, is left unknown by fame:"
13545,THE ARGUMENT.,"No human hand or hostile god was found,"
13546,THE ARGUMENT.,To boast the triumph of so base a wound.
13547,THE ARGUMENT.,
13548,THE ARGUMENT.,"When Turnus saw the Trojan quit the plain,"
13549,THE ARGUMENT.,"His chiefs dismay’d, his troops a fainting train,"
13550,THE ARGUMENT.,Th’ unhop’d event his heighten’d soul inspires:
13551,THE ARGUMENT.,At once his arms and coursers he requires;
13552,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, with a leap, his lofty chariot gains,"
13553,THE ARGUMENT.,And with a ready hand assumes the reins.
13554,THE ARGUMENT.,"He drives impetuous, and, where’er he goes,"
13555,THE ARGUMENT.,He leaves behind a lane of slaughter’d foes.
13556,THE ARGUMENT.,These his lance reaches; over those he rolls
13557,THE ARGUMENT.,"His rapid car, and crushes out their souls:"
13558,THE ARGUMENT.,In vain the vanquish’d fly; the victor sends
13559,THE ARGUMENT.,The dead men’s weapons at their living friends.
13560,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus, on the banks of Hebrus’ freezing flood,"
13561,THE ARGUMENT.,"The God of Battles, in his angry mood,"
13562,THE ARGUMENT.,"Clashing his sword against his brazen shield,"
13563,THE ARGUMENT.,"Let loose the reins, and scours along the field:"
13564,THE ARGUMENT.,Before the wind his fiery coursers fly;
13565,THE ARGUMENT.,"Groans the sad earth, resounds the rattling sky."
13566,THE ARGUMENT.,"Wrath, Terror, Treason, Tumult, and Despair"
13567,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Dire faces, and deform’d) surround the car;"
13568,THE ARGUMENT.,"Friends of the god, and followers of the war."
13569,THE ARGUMENT.,"With fury not unlike, nor less disdain,"
13570,THE ARGUMENT.,Exulting Turnus flies along the plain:
13571,THE ARGUMENT.,"His smoking horses, at their utmost speed,"
13572,THE ARGUMENT.,"He lashes on, and urges o’er the dead."
13573,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their fetlocks run with blood; and, when they bound,"
13574,THE ARGUMENT.,The gore and gath’ring dust are dash’d around.
13575,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thamyris and Pholus, masters of the war,"
13576,THE ARGUMENT.,"He kill’d at hand, but Sthenelus afar:"
13577,THE ARGUMENT.,"From far the sons of Imbracus he slew,"
13578,THE ARGUMENT.,"Glaucus and Lades, of the Lycian crew;"
13579,THE ARGUMENT.,"Both taught to fight on foot, in battle join’d,"
13580,THE ARGUMENT.,Or mount the courser that outstrips the wind.
13581,THE ARGUMENT.,
13582,THE ARGUMENT.,"Meantime Eumedes, vaunting in the field,"
13583,THE ARGUMENT.,"New fir’d the Trojans, and their foes repell’d."
13584,THE ARGUMENT.,"This son of Dolon bore his grandsire’s name,"
13585,THE ARGUMENT.,But emulated more his father’s fame;
13586,THE ARGUMENT.,"His guileful father, sent a nightly spy,"
13587,THE ARGUMENT.,The Grecian camp and order to descry:
13588,THE ARGUMENT.,Hard enterprise! and well he might require
13589,THE ARGUMENT.,"Achilles’ car and horses, for his hire:"
13590,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, met upon the scout, th’ Aetolian prince"
13591,THE ARGUMENT.,In death bestow’d a juster recompense.
13592,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fierce Turnus view’d the Trojan from afar,"
13593,THE ARGUMENT.,And launch’d his jav’lin from his lofty car;
13594,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then lightly leaping down, pursued the blow,"
13595,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, pressing with his foot his prostrate foe,"
13596,THE ARGUMENT.,"Wrench’d from his feeble hold the shining sword,"
13597,THE ARGUMENT.,And plung’d it in the bosom of its lord.
13598,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Possess,” said he, “the fruit of all thy pains,"
13599,THE ARGUMENT.,"And measure, at thy length, our Latian plains."
13600,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus are my foes rewarded by my hand;
13601,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus may they build their town, and thus enjoy the land!”"
13602,THE ARGUMENT.,
13603,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Dares, Butes, Sybaris he slew,"
13604,THE ARGUMENT.,Whom o’er his neck his flound’ring courser threw.
13605,THE ARGUMENT.,"As when loud Boreas, with his blust’ring train,"
13606,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stoops from above, incumbent on the main;"
13607,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where’er he flies, he drives the rack before,"
13608,THE ARGUMENT.,And rolls the billows on th’ Aegaean shore:
13609,THE ARGUMENT.,"So, where resistless Turnus takes his course,"
13610,THE ARGUMENT.,The scatter’d squadrons bend before his force;
13611,THE ARGUMENT.,His crest of horses’ hair is blown behind
13612,THE ARGUMENT.,"By adverse air, and rustles in the wind."
13613,THE ARGUMENT.,
13614,THE ARGUMENT.,"This haughty Phegeus saw with high disdain,"
13615,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, as the chariot roll’d along the plain,"
13616,THE ARGUMENT.,"Light from the ground he leapt, and seiz’d the rein."
13617,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus hung in air, he still retain’d his hold,"
13618,THE ARGUMENT.,"The coursers frighted, and their course controll’d."
13619,THE ARGUMENT.,"The lance of Turnus reach’d him as he hung,"
13620,THE ARGUMENT.,"And pierc’d his plated arms, but pass’d along,"
13621,THE ARGUMENT.,"And only raz’d the skin. He turn’d, and held"
13622,THE ARGUMENT.,Against his threat’ning foe his ample shield;
13623,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then call’d for aid: but, while he cried in vain,"
13624,THE ARGUMENT.,The chariot bore him backward on the plain.
13625,THE ARGUMENT.,"He lies revers’d; the victor king descends,"
13626,THE ARGUMENT.,"And strikes so justly where his helmet ends,"
13627,THE ARGUMENT.,He lops the head. The Latian fields are drunk
13628,THE ARGUMENT.,With streams that issue from the bleeding trunk.
13629,THE ARGUMENT.,
13630,THE ARGUMENT.,"While he triumphs, and while the Trojans yield,"
13631,THE ARGUMENT.,The wounded prince is forc’d to leave the field:
13632,THE ARGUMENT.,"Strong Mnestheus, and Achates often tried,"
13633,THE ARGUMENT.,"And young Ascanius, weeping by his side,"
13634,THE ARGUMENT.,Conduct him to his tent. Scarce can he rear
13635,THE ARGUMENT.,"His limbs from earth, supported on his spear."
13636,THE ARGUMENT.,"Resolv’d in mind, regardless of the smart,"
13637,THE ARGUMENT.,"He tugs with both his hands, and breaks the dart."
13638,THE ARGUMENT.,The steel remains. No readier way he found
13639,THE ARGUMENT.,"To draw the weapon, than t’ inlarge the wound."
13640,THE ARGUMENT.,"Eager of fight, impatient of delay,"
13641,THE ARGUMENT.,He begs; and his unwilling friends obey.
13642,THE ARGUMENT.,
13643,THE ARGUMENT.,"Iapis was at hand to prove his art,"
13644,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whose blooming youth so fir’d Apollo’s heart,"
13645,THE ARGUMENT.,"That, for his love, he proffer’d to bestow"
13646,THE ARGUMENT.,His tuneful harp and his unerring bow.
13647,THE ARGUMENT.,"The pious youth, more studious how to save"
13648,THE ARGUMENT.,"His aged sire, now sinking to the grave,"
13649,THE ARGUMENT.,"Preferr’d the pow’r of plants, and silent praise"
13650,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of healing arts, before Phoebean bays."
13651,THE ARGUMENT.,
13652,THE ARGUMENT.,"Propp’d on his lance the pensive hero stood,"
13653,THE ARGUMENT.,"And heard and saw, unmov’d, the mourning crowd."
13654,THE ARGUMENT.,The fam’d physician tucks his robes around
13655,THE ARGUMENT.,"With ready hands, and hastens to the wound."
13656,THE ARGUMENT.,"With gentle touches he performs his part,"
13657,THE ARGUMENT.,"This way and that, soliciting the dart,"
13658,THE ARGUMENT.,And exercises all his heav’nly art.
13659,THE ARGUMENT.,"All soft’ning simples, known of sov’reign use,"
13660,THE ARGUMENT.,"He presses out, and pours their noble juice."
13661,THE ARGUMENT.,"These first infus’d, to lenify the pain,"
13662,THE ARGUMENT.,"He tugs with pincers, but he tugs in vain."
13663,THE ARGUMENT.,Then to the patron of his art he pray’d:
13664,THE ARGUMENT.,The patron of his art refus’d his aid.
13665,THE ARGUMENT.,
13666,THE ARGUMENT.,Meantime the war approaches to the tents;
13667,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ alarm grows hotter, and the noise augments:"
13668,THE ARGUMENT.,The driving dust proclaims the danger near;
13669,THE ARGUMENT.,"And first their friends, and then their foes appear:"
13670,THE ARGUMENT.,Their friends retreat; their foes pursue the rear.
13671,THE ARGUMENT.,The camp is fill’d with terror and affright:
13672,THE ARGUMENT.,The hissing shafts within the trench alight;
13673,THE ARGUMENT.,"An undistinguish’d noise ascends the sky,"
13674,THE ARGUMENT.,"The shouts of those who kill, and groans of those who die."
13675,THE ARGUMENT.,
13676,THE ARGUMENT.,"But now the goddess mother, mov’d with grief,"
13677,THE ARGUMENT.,"And pierc’d with pity, hastens her relief."
13678,THE ARGUMENT.,"A branch of healing dittany she brought,"
13679,THE ARGUMENT.,Which in the Cretan fields with care she sought:
13680,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rough is the stem, which woolly leafs surround;"
13681,THE ARGUMENT.,"The leafs with flow’rs, the flow’rs with purple crown’d,"
13682,THE ARGUMENT.,Well known to wounded goats; a sure relief
13683,THE ARGUMENT.,"To draw the pointed steel, and ease the grief."
13684,THE ARGUMENT.,"This Venus brings, in clouds involv’d, and brews"
13685,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ extracted liquor with ambrosian dews,"
13686,THE ARGUMENT.,"And odorous panacee. Unseen she stands,"
13687,THE ARGUMENT.,"Temp’ring the mixture with her heav’nly hands,"
13688,THE ARGUMENT.,"And pours it in a bowl, already crown’d"
13689,THE ARGUMENT.,With juice of med’c’nal herbs prepar’d to bathe the wound.
13690,THE ARGUMENT.,"The leech, unknowing of superior art"
13691,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which aids the cure, with this foments the part;"
13692,THE ARGUMENT.,And in a moment ceas’d the raging smart.
13693,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stanch’d is the blood, and in the bottom stands:"
13694,THE ARGUMENT.,"The steel, but scarcely touch’d with tender hands,"
13695,THE ARGUMENT.,"Moves up, and follows of its own accord,"
13696,THE ARGUMENT.,And health and vigour are at once restor’d.
13697,THE ARGUMENT.,"Iapis first perceiv’d the closing wound,"
13698,THE ARGUMENT.,And first the footsteps of a god he found.
13699,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Arms! arms!” he cries; “the sword and shield prepare,"
13700,THE ARGUMENT.,"And send the willing chief, renew’d, to war."
13701,THE ARGUMENT.,"This is no mortal work, no cure of mine,"
13702,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor art’s effect, but done by hands divine."
13703,THE ARGUMENT.,Some god our general to the battle sends;
13704,THE ARGUMENT.,Some god preserves his life for greater ends.”
13705,THE ARGUMENT.,
13706,THE ARGUMENT.,The hero arms in haste; his hands infold
13707,THE ARGUMENT.,His thighs with cuishes of refulgent gold:
13708,THE ARGUMENT.,"Inflam’d to fight, and rushing to the field,"
13709,THE ARGUMENT.,"That hand sustaining the celestial shield,"
13710,THE ARGUMENT.,"This gripes the lance, and with such vigour shakes,"
13711,THE ARGUMENT.,That to the rest the beamy weapon quakes.
13712,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then with a close embrace he strain’d his son,"
13713,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, kissing thro’ his helmet, thus begun:"
13714,THE ARGUMENT.,"“My son, from my example learn the war,"
13715,THE ARGUMENT.,"In camps to suffer, and in fields to dare;"
13716,THE ARGUMENT.,But happier chance than mine attend thy care!
13717,THE ARGUMENT.,"This day my hand thy tender age shall shield,"
13718,THE ARGUMENT.,And crown with honours of the conquer’d field:
13719,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thou, when thy riper years shall send thee forth"
13720,THE ARGUMENT.,"To toils of war, be mindful of my worth;"
13721,THE ARGUMENT.,"Assert thy birthright, and in arms be known,"
13722,THE ARGUMENT.,"For Hector’s nephew, and Aeneas’ son.”"
13723,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said; and, striding, issued on the plain."
13724,THE ARGUMENT.,"Anteus and Mnestheus, and a num’rous train,"
13725,THE ARGUMENT.,"Attend his steps; the rest their weapons take,"
13726,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, crowding to the field, the camp forsake."
13727,THE ARGUMENT.,"A cloud of blinding dust is rais’d around,"
13728,THE ARGUMENT.,Labours beneath their feet the trembling ground.
13729,THE ARGUMENT.,
13730,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now Turnus, posted on a hill, from far"
13731,THE ARGUMENT.,Beheld the progress of the moving war:
13732,THE ARGUMENT.,"With him the Latins view’d the cover’d plains,"
13733,THE ARGUMENT.,And the chill blood ran backward in their veins.
13734,THE ARGUMENT.,"Juturna saw th’ advancing troops appear,"
13735,THE ARGUMENT.,"And heard the hostile sound, and fled for fear."
13736,THE ARGUMENT.,"Aeneas leads; and draws a sweeping train,"
13737,THE ARGUMENT.,"Clos’d in their ranks, and pouring on the plain."
13738,THE ARGUMENT.,"As when a whirlwind, rushing to the shore"
13739,THE ARGUMENT.,"From the mid ocean, drives the waves before;"
13740,THE ARGUMENT.,The painful hind with heavy heart foresees
13741,THE ARGUMENT.,"The flatted fields, and slaughter of the trees;"
13742,THE ARGUMENT.,With like impetuous rage the prince appears
13743,THE ARGUMENT.,"Before his doubled front, nor less destruction bears."
13744,THE ARGUMENT.,And now both armies shock in open field;
13745,THE ARGUMENT.,Osiris is by strong Thymbraeus kill’d.
13746,THE ARGUMENT.,"Archetius, Ufens, Epulon, are slain"
13747,THE ARGUMENT.,"(All fam’d in arms, and of the Latian train)"

13749,THE ARGUMENT.,"The fatal augur falls, by whose command"
13750,THE ARGUMENT.,"The truce was broken, and whose lance, embrued"
13751,THE ARGUMENT.,"With Trojan blood, th’ unhappy fight renew’d."
13752,THE ARGUMENT.,"Loud shouts and clamours rend the liquid sky,"
13753,THE ARGUMENT.,And o’er the field the frighted Latins fly.
13754,THE ARGUMENT.,"The prince disdains the dastards to pursue,"
13755,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor moves to meet in arms the fighting few;
13756,THE ARGUMENT.,"Turnus alone, amid the dusky plain,"
13757,THE ARGUMENT.,"He seeks, and to the combat calls in vain."
13758,THE ARGUMENT.,"Juturna heard, and, seiz’d with mortal fear,"
13759,THE ARGUMENT.,Forc’d from the beam her brother’s charioteer;
13760,THE ARGUMENT.,"Assumes his shape, his armour, and his mien,"
13761,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, like Metiscus, in his seat is seen."
13762,THE ARGUMENT.,
13763,THE ARGUMENT.,As the black swallow near the palace plies;
13764,THE ARGUMENT.,"O’er empty courts, and under arches, flies;"
13765,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now hawks aloft, now skims along the flood,"
13766,THE ARGUMENT.,To furnish her loquacious nest with food:
13767,THE ARGUMENT.,So drives the rapid goddess o’er the plains;
13768,THE ARGUMENT.,The smoking horses run with loosen’d reins.
13769,THE ARGUMENT.,She steers a various course among the foes;
13770,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now here, now there, her conqu’ring brother shows;"
13771,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now with a straight, now with a wheeling flight,"
13772,THE ARGUMENT.,"She turns, and bends, but shuns the single fight."
13773,THE ARGUMENT.,"Aeneas, fir’d with fury, breaks the crowd,"
13774,THE ARGUMENT.,"And seeks his foe, and calls by name aloud:"
13775,THE ARGUMENT.,"He runs within a narrower ring, and tries"
13776,THE ARGUMENT.,To stop the chariot; but the chariot flies.
13777,THE ARGUMENT.,"If he but gain a glimpse, Juturna fears,"
13778,THE ARGUMENT.,And far away the Daunian hero bears.
13779,THE ARGUMENT.,
13780,THE ARGUMENT.,What should he do! Nor arts nor arms avail;
13781,THE ARGUMENT.,And various cares in vain his mind assail.
13782,THE ARGUMENT.,"The great Messapus, thund’ring thro’ the field,"
13783,THE ARGUMENT.,In his left hand two pointed jav’lins held:
13784,THE ARGUMENT.,"Encount’ring on the prince, one dart he drew,"
13785,THE ARGUMENT.,And with unerring aim and utmost vigour threw.
13786,THE ARGUMENT.,"Aeneas saw it come, and, stooping low"
13787,THE ARGUMENT.,"Beneath his buckler, shunn’d the threat’ning blow."
13788,THE ARGUMENT.,"The weapon hiss’d above his head, and tore"
13789,THE ARGUMENT.,The waving plume which on his helm he wore.
13790,THE ARGUMENT.,"Forced by this hostile act, and fir’d with spite,"
13791,THE ARGUMENT.,"That flying Turnus still declin’d the fight,"
13792,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Prince, whose piety had long repell’d"
13793,THE ARGUMENT.,"His inborn ardour, now invades the field;"
13794,THE ARGUMENT.,"Invokes the pow’rs of violated peace,"
13795,THE ARGUMENT.,Their rites and injur’d altars to redress;
13796,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, to his rage abandoning the rein,"
13797,THE ARGUMENT.,With blood and slaughter’d bodies fills the plain.
13798,THE ARGUMENT.,
13799,THE ARGUMENT.,"What god can tell, what numbers can display,"
13800,THE ARGUMENT.,The various labours of that fatal day;
13801,THE ARGUMENT.,"What chiefs and champions fell on either side,"
13802,THE ARGUMENT.,"In combat slain, or by what deaths they died;"
13803,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whom Turnus, whom the Trojan hero kill’d;"
13804,THE ARGUMENT.,Who shar’d the fame and fortune of the field!
13805,THE ARGUMENT.,"Jove, could’st thou view, and not avert thy sight,"
13806,THE ARGUMENT.,"Two jarring nations join’d in cruel fight,"

13812,THE ARGUMENT.,"It reach’d his heart, nor needs a second thrust."
13813,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now Turnus, at two blows, two brethren slew;"
13814,THE ARGUMENT.,First from his horse fierce Amycus he threw:
13815,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, leaping on the ground, on foot assail’d"
13816,THE ARGUMENT.,"Diores, and in equal fight prevail’d."
13817,THE ARGUMENT.,Their lifeless trunks he leaves upon the place;
13818,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their heads, distilling gore, his chariot grace."
13819,THE ARGUMENT.,
13820,THE ARGUMENT.,"Three cold on earth the Trojan hero threw,"
13821,THE ARGUMENT.,Whom without respite at one charge he slew:
13822,THE ARGUMENT.,"Cethegus, Tanais, Tagus, fell oppress’d,"
13823,THE ARGUMENT.,"And sad Onythes, added to the rest,"
13824,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of Theban blood, whom Peridia bore."
13825,THE ARGUMENT.,
13826,THE ARGUMENT.,"Turnus two brothers from the Lycian shore,"
13827,THE ARGUMENT.,"And from Apollo’s fane to battle sent,"
13828,THE ARGUMENT.,O’erthrew; nor Phoebus could their fate prevent.
13829,THE ARGUMENT.,"Peaceful Menoetes after these he kill’d,"
13830,THE ARGUMENT.,Who long had shunn’d the dangers of the field:
13831,THE ARGUMENT.,"On Lerna’s lake a silent life he led,"
13832,THE ARGUMENT.,And with his nets and angle earn’d his bread;
13833,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor pompous cares, nor palaces, he knew,"
13834,THE ARGUMENT.,But wisely from th’ infectious world withdrew:
13835,THE ARGUMENT.,Poor was his house; his father’s painful hand
13836,THE ARGUMENT.,"Discharg’d his rent, and plow’d another’s land."
13837,THE ARGUMENT.,
13838,THE ARGUMENT.,As flames among the lofty woods are thrown
13839,THE ARGUMENT.,"On diff’rent sides, and both by winds are blown;"
13840,THE ARGUMENT.,The laurels crackle in the sputt’ring fire;
13841,THE ARGUMENT.,The frighted sylvans from their shades retire:
13842,THE ARGUMENT.,Or as two neighb’ring torrents fall from high;
13843,THE ARGUMENT.,Rapid they run; the foamy waters fry;
13844,THE ARGUMENT.,"They roll to sea with unresisted force,"
13845,THE ARGUMENT.,And down the rocks precipitate their course:
13846,THE ARGUMENT.,Not with less rage the rival heroes take
13847,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their diff’rent ways, nor less destruction make."
13848,THE ARGUMENT.,"With spears afar, with swords at hand, they strike;"
13849,THE ARGUMENT.,And zeal of slaughter fires their souls alike.
13850,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like them, their dauntless men maintain the field;"
13851,THE ARGUMENT.,"And hearts are pierc’d, unknowing how to yield:"
13852,THE ARGUMENT.,"They blow for blow return, and wound for wound;"
13853,THE ARGUMENT.,And heaps of bodies raise the level ground.
13854,THE ARGUMENT.,
13855,THE ARGUMENT.,"Murranus, boasting of his blood, that springs"
13856,THE ARGUMENT.,"From a long royal race of Latian kings,"
13857,THE ARGUMENT.,"Is by the Trojan from his chariot thrown,"
13858,THE ARGUMENT.,Crush’d with the weight of an unwieldy stone:
13859,THE ARGUMENT.,"Betwixt the wheels he fell; the wheels, that bore"
13860,THE ARGUMENT.,"His living load, his dying body tore."
13861,THE ARGUMENT.,"His starting steeds, to shun the glitt’ring sword,"
13862,THE ARGUMENT.,"Paw down his trampled limbs, forgetful of their lord."
13863,THE ARGUMENT.,
13864,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fierce Hyllus threaten’d high, and, face to face,"
13865,THE ARGUMENT.,Affronted Turnus in the middle space:
13866,THE ARGUMENT.,"The prince encounter’d him in full career,"
13867,THE ARGUMENT.,And at his temples aim’d the deadly spear;
13868,THE ARGUMENT.,"So fatally the flying weapon sped,"
13869,THE ARGUMENT.,That thro’ his brazen helm it pierc’d his head.
13870,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor, Cisseus, couldst thou scape from Turnus’ hand,"
13871,THE ARGUMENT.,In vain the strongest of th’ Arcadian band:
13872,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor to Cupentus could his gods afford
13873,THE ARGUMENT.,"Availing aid against th’ Aenean sword,"
13874,THE ARGUMENT.,Which to his naked heart pursued the course;
13875,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor could his plated shield sustain the force.
13876,THE ARGUMENT.,
13877,THE ARGUMENT.,"Iolas fell, whom not the Grecian pow’rs,"
13878,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor great subverter of the Trojan tow’rs,"
13879,THE ARGUMENT.,"Were doom’d to kill, while Heav’n prolong’d his date;"
13880,THE ARGUMENT.,"But who can pass the bounds, prefix’d by fate?"
13881,THE ARGUMENT.,"In high Lyrnessus, and in Troy, he held"
13882,THE ARGUMENT.,"Two palaces, and was from each expell’d:"
13883,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of all the mighty man, the last remains"
13884,THE ARGUMENT.,A little spot of foreign earth contains.
13885,THE ARGUMENT.,
13886,THE ARGUMENT.,And now both hosts their broken troops unite
13887,THE ARGUMENT.,"In equal ranks, and mix in mortal fight."
13888,THE ARGUMENT.,Seresthus and undaunted Mnestheus join
13889,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojan, Tuscan, and Arcadian line:"
13890,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sea-born Messapus, with Atinas, heads"
13891,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Latin squadrons, and to battle leads."
13892,THE ARGUMENT.,"They strike, they push, they throng the scanty space,"
13893,THE ARGUMENT.,"Resolv’d on death, impatient of disgrace;"
13894,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, where one falls, another fills his place."
13895,THE ARGUMENT.,
13896,THE ARGUMENT.,The Cyprian goddess now inspires her son
13897,THE ARGUMENT.,"To leave th’ unfinish’d fight, and storm the town:"
13898,THE ARGUMENT.,"For, while he rolls his eyes around the plain"
13899,THE ARGUMENT.,"In quest of Turnus, whom he seeks in vain,"
13900,THE ARGUMENT.,"He views th’ unguarded city from afar,"
13901,THE ARGUMENT.,"In careless quiet, and secure of war."
13902,THE ARGUMENT.,"Occasion offers, and excites his mind"
13903,THE ARGUMENT.,To dare beyond the task he first design’d.
13904,THE ARGUMENT.,"Resolv’d, he calls his chiefs; they leave the fight:"
13905,THE ARGUMENT.,"Attended thus, he takes a neighb’ring height;"
13906,THE ARGUMENT.,"The crowding troops about their gen’ral stand,"
13907,THE ARGUMENT.,"All under arms, and wait his high command."
13908,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then thus the lofty prince: “Hear and obey,"
13909,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ye Trojan bands, without the least delay"
13910,THE ARGUMENT.,Jove is with us; and what I have decreed
13911,THE ARGUMENT.,"Requires our utmost vigour, and our speed."
13912,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your instant arms against the town prepare,"
13913,THE ARGUMENT.,"The source of mischief, and the seat of war."
13914,THE ARGUMENT.,"This day the Latian tow’rs, that mate the sky,"
13915,THE ARGUMENT.,Shall level with the plain in ashes lie:
13916,THE ARGUMENT.,"The people shall be slaves, unless in time"
13917,THE ARGUMENT.,"They kneel for pardon, and repent their crime."
13918,THE ARGUMENT.,Twice have our foes been vanquish’d on the plain:
13919,THE ARGUMENT.,Then shall I wait till Turnus will be slain?
13920,THE ARGUMENT.,Your force against the perjur’d city bend.
13921,THE ARGUMENT.,"There it began, and there the war shall end."
13922,THE ARGUMENT.,The peace profan’d our rightful arms requires;
13923,THE ARGUMENT.,Cleanse the polluted place with purging fires.”
13924,THE ARGUMENT.,
13925,THE ARGUMENT.,"He finish’d; and, one soul inspiring all,"
13926,THE ARGUMENT.,"Form’d in a wedge, the foot approach the wall."
13927,THE ARGUMENT.,"Without the town, an unprovided train"
13928,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of gaping, gazing citizens are slain."
13929,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some firebrands, others scaling ladders bear,"
13930,THE ARGUMENT.,"And those they toss aloft, and these they rear:"
13931,THE ARGUMENT.,"The flames now launch’d, the feather’d arrows fly,"
13932,THE ARGUMENT.,And clouds of missive arms obscure the sky.
13933,THE ARGUMENT.,"Advancing to the front, the hero stands,"
13934,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, stretching out to heav’n his pious hands,"
13935,THE ARGUMENT.,"Attests the gods, asserts his innocence,"
13936,THE ARGUMENT.,Upbraids with breach of faith th’ Ausonian prince;
13937,THE ARGUMENT.,"Declares the royal honour doubly stain’d,"
13938,THE ARGUMENT.,And twice the rites of holy peace profan’d.
13939,THE ARGUMENT.,
13940,THE ARGUMENT.,Dissenting clamours in the town arise;
13941,THE ARGUMENT.,"Each will be heard, and all at once advise."
13942,THE ARGUMENT.,"One part for peace, and one for war contends;"
13943,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some would exclude their foes, and some admit their friends."
13944,THE ARGUMENT.,"The helpless king is hurried in the throng,"
13945,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, whate’er tide prevails, is borne along."
13946,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus, when the swain, within a hollow rock,"
13947,THE ARGUMENT.,"Invades the bees with suffocating smoke,"
13948,THE ARGUMENT.,"They run around, or labour on their wings,"
13949,THE ARGUMENT.,"Disus’d to flight, and shoot their sleepy stings;"
13950,THE ARGUMENT.,To shun the bitter fumes in vain they try;
13951,THE ARGUMENT.,"Black vapours, issuing from the vent, involve the sky."
13952,THE ARGUMENT.,
13953,THE ARGUMENT.,But fate and envious fortune now prepare
13954,THE ARGUMENT.,To plunge the Latins in the last despair.
13955,THE ARGUMENT.,"The queen, who saw the foes invade the town,"
13956,THE ARGUMENT.,"And brands on tops of burning houses thrown,"
13957,THE ARGUMENT.,"Cast round her eyes, distracted with her fear—"
13958,THE ARGUMENT.,No troops of Turnus in the field appear.
13959,THE ARGUMENT.,"Once more she stares abroad, but still in vain,"
13960,THE ARGUMENT.,And then concludes the royal youth is slain.
13961,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mad with her anguish, impotent to bear"
13962,THE ARGUMENT.,"The mighty grief, she loathes the vital air."
13963,THE ARGUMENT.,"She calls herself the cause of all this ill,"
13964,THE ARGUMENT.,And owns the dire effects of her ungovern’d will;
13965,THE ARGUMENT.,She raves against the gods; she beats her breast;
13966,THE ARGUMENT.,She tears with both her hands her purple vest:
13967,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then round a beam a running noose she tied,"
13968,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, fasten’d by the neck, obscenely died."
13969,THE ARGUMENT.,
13970,THE ARGUMENT.,"Soon as the fatal news by Fame was blown,"
13971,THE ARGUMENT.,"And to her dames and to her daughter known,"
13972,THE ARGUMENT.,The sad Lavinia rends her yellow hair
13973,THE ARGUMENT.,And rosy cheeks; the rest her sorrow share:
13974,THE ARGUMENT.,"With shrieks the palace rings, and madness of despair."
13975,THE ARGUMENT.,The spreading rumour fills the public place:
13976,THE ARGUMENT.,"Confusion, fear, distraction, and disgrace,"
13977,THE ARGUMENT.,"And silent shame, are seen in ev’ry face."
13978,THE ARGUMENT.,"Latinus tears his garments as he goes,"
13979,THE ARGUMENT.,Both for his public and his private woes;
13980,THE ARGUMENT.,"With filth his venerable beard besmears,"
13981,THE ARGUMENT.,And sordid dust deforms his silver hairs.
13982,THE ARGUMENT.,"And much he blames the softness of his mind,"
13983,THE ARGUMENT.,"Obnoxious to the charms of womankind,"
13984,THE ARGUMENT.,And soon seduc’d to change what he so well design’d;
13985,THE ARGUMENT.,"To break the solemn league so long desir’d,"
13986,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor finish what his fates, and those of Troy, requir’d."
13987,THE ARGUMENT.,
13988,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now Turnus rolls aloof o’er empty plains,"
13989,THE ARGUMENT.,And here and there some straggling foes he gleans.
13990,THE ARGUMENT.,"His flying coursers please him less and less,"
13991,THE ARGUMENT.,Asham’d of easy fight and cheap success.
13992,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus half-contented, anxious in his mind,"
13993,THE ARGUMENT.,"The distant cries come driving in the wind,"
13994,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shouts from the walls, but shouts in murmurs drown’d;"
13995,THE ARGUMENT.,"A jarring mixture, and a boding sound."
13996,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Alas!” said he, “what mean these dismal cries?"
13997,THE ARGUMENT.,What doleful clamours from the town arise?”
13998,THE ARGUMENT.,"Confus’d, he stops, and backward pulls the reins."
13999,THE ARGUMENT.,"She who the driver’s office now sustains,"
14000,THE ARGUMENT.,"Replies: “Neglect, my lord, these new alarms;"
14001,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here fight, and urge the fortune of your arms:"
14002,THE ARGUMENT.,There want not others to defend the wall.
14003,THE ARGUMENT.,"If by your rival’s hand th’ Italians fall,"
14004,THE ARGUMENT.,"So shall your fatal sword his friends oppress,"
14005,THE ARGUMENT.,"In honour equal, equal in success.”"
14006,THE ARGUMENT.,
14007,THE ARGUMENT.,"To this, the prince: “O sister—for I knew"
14008,THE ARGUMENT.,The peace infring’d proceeded first from you;
14009,THE ARGUMENT.,"I knew you, when you mingled first in fight;"
14010,THE ARGUMENT.,And now in vain you would deceive my sight—
14011,THE ARGUMENT.,"Why, goddess, this unprofitable care?"
14012,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who sent you down from heav’n, involv’d in air,"
14013,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your share of mortal sorrows to sustain,"
14014,THE ARGUMENT.,And see your brother bleeding on the plain?
14015,THE ARGUMENT.,"For to what pow’r can Turnus have recourse,"
14016,THE ARGUMENT.,Or how resist his fate’s prevailing force?
14017,THE ARGUMENT.,These eyes beheld Murranus bite the ground:
14018,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mighty the man, and mighty was the wound."
14019,THE ARGUMENT.,"I heard my dearest friend, with dying breath,"
14020,THE ARGUMENT.,My name invoking to revenge his death.
14021,THE ARGUMENT.,"Brave Ufens fell with honour on the place,"
14022,THE ARGUMENT.,To shun the shameful sight of my disgrace.
14023,THE ARGUMENT.,"On earth supine, a manly corpse he lies;"
14024,THE ARGUMENT.,His vest and armour are the victor’s prize.
14025,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, shall I see Laurentum in a flame,"
14026,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which only wanted, to complete my shame?"
14027,THE ARGUMENT.,How will the Latins hoot their champion’s flight!
14028,THE ARGUMENT.,How Drances will insult and point them to the sight!
14029,THE ARGUMENT.,"Is death so hard to bear? Ye gods below,"
14030,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Since those above so small compassion show,)"
14031,THE ARGUMENT.,"Receive a soul unsullied yet with shame,"
14032,THE ARGUMENT.,Which not belies my great forefather’s name!”
14033,THE ARGUMENT.,
14034,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said; and while he spoke, with flying speed"
14035,THE ARGUMENT.,Came Sages urging on his foamy steed:
14036,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fix’d on his wounded face a shaft he bore,"
14037,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, seeking Turnus, sent his voice before:"
14038,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Turnus, on you, on you alone, depends"
14039,THE ARGUMENT.,Our last relief: compassionate your friends!
14040,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like lightning, fierce Aeneas, rolling on,"
14041,THE ARGUMENT.,"With arms invests, with flames invades the town:"
14042,THE ARGUMENT.,The brands are toss’d on high; the winds conspire
14043,THE ARGUMENT.,To drive along the deluge of the fire.
14044,THE ARGUMENT.,All eyes are fix’d on you: your foes rejoice;
14045,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ev’n the king staggers, and suspends his choice;"
14046,THE ARGUMENT.,"Doubts to deliver or defend the town,"
14047,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whom to reject, or whom to call his son."
14048,THE ARGUMENT.,"The queen, on whom your utmost hopes were plac’d,"
14049,THE ARGUMENT.,"Herself suborning death, has breath’d her last."
14050,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Tis true, Messapus, fearless of his fate,"
14051,THE ARGUMENT.,"With fierce Atinas’ aid, defends the gate:"
14052,THE ARGUMENT.,"On ev’ry side surrounded by the foe,"
14053,THE ARGUMENT.,"The more they kill, the greater numbers grow;"
14054,THE ARGUMENT.,"An iron harvest mounts, and still remains to mow."
14055,THE ARGUMENT.,"You, far aloof from your forsaken bands,"
14056,THE ARGUMENT.,Your rolling chariot drive o’er empty sands.
14057,THE ARGUMENT.,
14058,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stupid he sate, his eyes on earth declin’d,"
14059,THE ARGUMENT.,And various cares revolving in his mind:
14060,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rage, boiling from the bottom of his breast,"
14061,THE ARGUMENT.,"And sorrow mix’d with shame, his soul oppress’d;"
14062,THE ARGUMENT.,"And conscious worth lay lab’ring in his thought,"
14063,THE ARGUMENT.,And love by jealousy to madness wrought.
14064,THE ARGUMENT.,By slow degrees his reason drove away
14065,THE ARGUMENT.,"The mists of passion, and resum’d her sway."
14066,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, rising on his car, he turn’d his look,"
14067,THE ARGUMENT.,And saw the town involv’d in fire and smoke.
14068,THE ARGUMENT.,"A wooden tow’r with flames already blaz’d,"
14069,THE ARGUMENT.,Which his own hands on beams and rafters rais’d;
14070,THE ARGUMENT.,"And bridges laid above to join the space,"
14071,THE ARGUMENT.,And wheels below to roll from place to place.
14072,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Sister, the Fates have vanquish’d: let us go"
14073,THE ARGUMENT.,The way which Heav’n and my hard fortune show.
14074,THE ARGUMENT.,The fight is fix’d; nor shall the branded name
14075,THE ARGUMENT.,Of a base coward blot your brother’s fame.
14076,THE ARGUMENT.,Death is my choice; but suffer me to try
14077,THE ARGUMENT.,"My force, and vent my rage before I die.”"
14078,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said; and, leaping down without delay,"
14079,THE ARGUMENT.,Thro’ crowds of scatter’d foes he freed his way.
14080,THE ARGUMENT.,"Striding he pass’d, impetuous as the wind,"
14081,THE ARGUMENT.,And left the grieving goddess far behind.
14082,THE ARGUMENT.,"As when a fragment, from a mountain torn"
14083,THE ARGUMENT.,"By raging tempests, or by torrents borne,"
14084,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or sapp’d by time, or loosen’d from the roots—"
14085,THE ARGUMENT.,"Prone thro’ the void the rocky ruin shoots,"
14086,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rolling from crag to crag, from steep to steep;"
14087,THE ARGUMENT.,"Down sink, at once, the shepherds and their sheep:"
14088,THE ARGUMENT.,"Involv’d alike, they rush to nether ground;"
14089,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stunn’d with the shock they fall, and stunn’d from earth rebound:"
14090,THE ARGUMENT.,"So Turnus, hasting headlong to the town,"
14091,THE ARGUMENT.,"Should’ring and shoving, bore the squadrons down."
14092,THE ARGUMENT.,"Still pressing onward, to the walls he drew,"
14093,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where shafts, and spears, and darts promiscuous flew,"
14094,THE ARGUMENT.,And sanguine streams the slipp’ry ground embrue.
14095,THE ARGUMENT.,"First stretching out his arm, in sign of peace,"
14096,THE ARGUMENT.,"He cries aloud, to make the combat cease:"
14097,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Rutulians, hold; and Latin troops, retire!"
14098,THE ARGUMENT.,The fight is mine; and me the gods require.
14099,THE ARGUMENT.,’Tis just that I should vindicate alone
14100,THE ARGUMENT.,"The broken truce, or for the breach atone."
14101,THE ARGUMENT.,"This day shall free from wars th’ Ausonian state,"
14102,THE ARGUMENT.,Or finish my misfortunes in my fate.”
14103,THE ARGUMENT.,
14104,THE ARGUMENT.,"Both armies from their bloody work desist,"
14105,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, bearing backward, form a spacious list."
14106,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Trojan hero, who receiv’d from fame"
14107,THE ARGUMENT.,"The welcome sound, and heard the champion’s name,"
14108,THE ARGUMENT.,"Soon leaves the taken works and mounted walls,"
14109,THE ARGUMENT.,Greedy of war where greater glory calls.
14110,THE ARGUMENT.,"He springs to fight, exulting in his force"
14111,THE ARGUMENT.,His jointed armour rattles in the course.
14112,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like Eryx, or like Athos, great he shows,"
14113,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or Father Apennine, when, white with snows,"
14114,THE ARGUMENT.,"His head divine obscure in clouds he hides,"
14115,THE ARGUMENT.,And shakes the sounding forest on his sides.
14116,THE ARGUMENT.,"The nations, overaw’d, surcease the fight;"
14117,THE ARGUMENT.,"Immovable their bodies, fix’d their sight."
14118,THE ARGUMENT.,Ev’n death stands still; nor from above they throw
14119,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their darts, nor drive their batt’ring-rams below."
14120,THE ARGUMENT.,"In silent order either army stands,"
14121,THE ARGUMENT.,"And drop their swords, unknowing, from their hands."
14122,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ Ausonian king beholds, with wond’ring sight,"
14123,THE ARGUMENT.,"Two mighty champions match’d in single fight,"
14124,THE ARGUMENT.,"Born under climes remote, and brought by fate,"
14125,THE ARGUMENT.,With swords to try their titles to the state.
14126,THE ARGUMENT.,
14127,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, in clos’d field, each other from afar"
14128,THE ARGUMENT.,"They view; and, rushing on, begin the war."
14129,THE ARGUMENT.,They launch their spears; then hand to hand they meet;
14130,THE ARGUMENT.,The trembling soil resounds beneath their feet:
14131,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their bucklers clash; thick blows descend from high,"
14132,THE ARGUMENT.,And flakes of fire from their hard helmets fly.
14133,THE ARGUMENT.,"Courage conspires with chance, and both engage"
14134,THE ARGUMENT.,"With equal fortune yet, and mutual rage."
14135,THE ARGUMENT.,As when two bulls for their fair female fight
14136,THE ARGUMENT.,"In Sila’s shades, or on Taburnus’ height;"
14137,THE ARGUMENT.,With horns adverse they meet; the keeper flies;
14138,THE ARGUMENT.,"Mute stands the herd; the heifers roll their eyes,"
14139,THE ARGUMENT.,"And wait th’ event; which victor they shall bear,"
14140,THE ARGUMENT.,"And who shall be the lord, to rule the lusty year:"
14141,THE ARGUMENT.,"With rage of love the jealous rivals burn,"
14142,THE ARGUMENT.,"And push for push, and wound for wound return;"
14143,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their dewlaps gor’d, their sides are lav’d in blood;"
14144,THE ARGUMENT.,Loud cries and roaring sounds rebellow thro’ the wood:
14145,THE ARGUMENT.,Such was the combat in the listed ground;
14146,THE ARGUMENT.,"So clash their swords, and so their shields resound."
14147,THE ARGUMENT.,
14148,THE ARGUMENT.,Jove sets the beam; in either scale he lays
14149,THE ARGUMENT.,"The champions’ fate, and each exactly weighs."
14150,THE ARGUMENT.,"On this side, life and lucky chance ascends;"
14151,THE ARGUMENT.,"Loaded with death, that other scale descends."
14152,THE ARGUMENT.,"Rais’d on the stretch, young Turnus aims a blow"
14153,THE ARGUMENT.,Full on the helm of his unguarded foe:
14154,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shrill shouts and clamours ring on either side,"
14155,THE ARGUMENT.,As hopes and fears their panting hearts divide.
14156,THE ARGUMENT.,"But all in pieces flies the traitor sword,"
14157,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, in the middle stroke, deserts his lord."
14158,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now is but death, or flight; disarm’d he flies,"
14159,THE ARGUMENT.,When in his hand an unknown hilt he spies.
14160,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fame says that Turnus, when his steeds he join’d,"
14161,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hurrying to war, disorder’d in his mind,"
14162,THE ARGUMENT.,Snatch’d the first weapon which his haste could find.
14163,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Twas not the fated sword his father bore,"
14164,THE ARGUMENT.,But that his charioteer Metiscus wore.
14165,THE ARGUMENT.,"This, while the Trojans fled, the toughness held;"
14166,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, vain against the great Vulcanian shield,"
14167,THE ARGUMENT.,The mortal-temper’d steel deceiv’d his hand:
14168,THE ARGUMENT.,The shiver’d fragments shone amid the sand.
14169,THE ARGUMENT.,
14170,THE ARGUMENT.,"Surpris’d with fear, he fled along the field,"
14171,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now forthright, and now in orbits wheel’d;"
14172,THE ARGUMENT.,"For here the Trojan troops the list surround,"
14173,THE ARGUMENT.,And there the pass is clos’d with pools and marshy ground.
14174,THE ARGUMENT.,"Aeneas hastens, tho’ with heavier pace—"
14175,THE ARGUMENT.,"His wound, so newly knit, retards the chase,"
14176,THE ARGUMENT.,And oft his trembling knees their aid refuse—
14177,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet, pressing foot by foot, his foe pursues."
14178,THE ARGUMENT.,
14179,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus, when a fearful stag is clos’d around"
14180,THE ARGUMENT.,"With crimson toils, or in a river found,"
14181,THE ARGUMENT.,"High on the bank the deep-mouth’d hound appears,"
14182,THE ARGUMENT.,"Still opening, following still, where’er he steers;"
14183,THE ARGUMENT.,"The persecuted creature, to and fro,"
14184,THE ARGUMENT.,"Turns here and there, to scape his Umbrian foe:"
14185,THE ARGUMENT.,"Steep is th’ ascent, and, if he gains the land,"
14186,THE ARGUMENT.,The purple death is pitch’d along the strand.
14187,THE ARGUMENT.,"His eager foe, determin’d to the chase,"
14188,THE ARGUMENT.,"Stretch’d at his length, gains ground at ev’ry pace;"
14189,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now to his beamy head he makes his way,"
14190,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now he holds, or thinks he holds, his prey:"
14191,THE ARGUMENT.,"Just at the pinch, the stag springs out with fear;"
14192,THE ARGUMENT.,"He bites the wind, and fills his sounding jaws with air:"
14193,THE ARGUMENT.,"The rocks, the lakes, the meadows ring with cries;"
14194,THE ARGUMENT.,"The mortal tumult mounts, and thunders in the skies."
14195,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus flies the Daunian prince, and, flying, blames"
14196,THE ARGUMENT.,"His tardy troops, and, calling by their names,"
14197,THE ARGUMENT.,Demands his trusty sword. The Trojan threats
14198,THE ARGUMENT.,"The realm with ruin, and their ancient seats"
14199,THE ARGUMENT.,"To lay in ashes, if they dare supply"
14200,THE ARGUMENT.,With arms or aid his vanquish’d enemy:
14201,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus menacing, he still pursues the course,"
14202,THE ARGUMENT.,"With vigour, tho’ diminish’d of his force."
14203,THE ARGUMENT.,Ten times already round the listed place
14204,THE ARGUMENT.,"One chief had fled, and t’ other giv’n the chase:"
14205,THE ARGUMENT.,No trivial prize is play’d; for on the life
14206,THE ARGUMENT.,Or death of Turnus now depends the strife.
14207,THE ARGUMENT.,
14208,THE ARGUMENT.,"Within the space, an olive tree had stood,"
14209,THE ARGUMENT.,"A sacred shade, a venerable wood,"
14210,THE ARGUMENT.,"For vows to Faunus paid, the Latins’ guardian god."
14211,THE ARGUMENT.,"Here hung the vests, and tablets were engrav’d,"
14212,THE ARGUMENT.,Of sinking mariners from shipwreck sav’d.
14213,THE ARGUMENT.,"With heedless hands the Trojans fell’d the tree,"
14214,THE ARGUMENT.,To make the ground enclos’d for combat free.
14215,THE ARGUMENT.,"Deep in the root, whether by fate, or chance,"
14216,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or erring haste, the Trojan drove his lance;"
14217,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then stoop’d, and tugg’d with force immense, to free"
14218,THE ARGUMENT.,Th’ incumber’d spear from the tenacious tree;
14219,THE ARGUMENT.,"That, whom his fainting limbs pursued in vain,"
14220,THE ARGUMENT.,His flying weapon might from far attain.
14221,THE ARGUMENT.,
14222,THE ARGUMENT.,"Confus’d with fear, bereft of human aid,"
14223,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then Turnus to the gods, and first to Faunus pray’d:"
14224,THE ARGUMENT.,"“O Faunus, pity! and thou Mother Earth,"
14225,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where I thy foster son receiv’d my birth,"
14226,THE ARGUMENT.,Hold fast the steel! If my religious hand
14227,THE ARGUMENT.,"Your plant has honour’d, which your foes profan’d,"
14228,THE ARGUMENT.,"Propitious hear my pious pray’r!” He said,"
14229,THE ARGUMENT.,Nor with successless vows invok’d their aid.
14230,THE ARGUMENT.,"Th’ incumbent hero wrench’d, and pull’d, and strain’d;"
14231,THE ARGUMENT.,But still the stubborn earth the steel detain’d.
14232,THE ARGUMENT.,"Juturna took her time; and, while in vain"
14233,THE ARGUMENT.,"He strove, assum’d Meticus’ form again,"
14234,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, in that imitated shape, restor’d"
14235,THE ARGUMENT.,To the despairing prince his Daunian sword.
14236,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Queen of Love, who, with disdain and grief,"
14237,THE ARGUMENT.,"Saw the bold nymph afford this prompt relief,"
14238,THE ARGUMENT.,"T’ assert her offspring with a greater deed,"
14239,THE ARGUMENT.,From the tough root the ling’ring weapon freed.
14240,THE ARGUMENT.,
14241,THE ARGUMENT.,"Once more erect, the rival chiefs advance:"
14242,THE ARGUMENT.,"One trusts the sword, and one the pointed lance;"
14243,THE ARGUMENT.,And both resolv’d alike to try their fatal chance.
14244,THE ARGUMENT.,
14245,THE ARGUMENT.,"Meantime imperial Jove to Juno spoke,"
14246,THE ARGUMENT.,Who from a shining cloud beheld the shock:
14247,THE ARGUMENT.,"“What new arrest, O Queen of Heav’n, is sent"
14248,THE ARGUMENT.,To stop the Fates now lab’ring in th’ event?
14249,THE ARGUMENT.,What farther hopes are left thee to pursue?
14250,THE ARGUMENT.,"Divine Aeneas, (and thou know’st it too,)"
14251,THE ARGUMENT.,"Foredoom’d, to these celestial seats are due."
14252,THE ARGUMENT.,"What more attempts for Turnus can be made,"
14253,THE ARGUMENT.,That thus thou ling’rest in this lonely shade?
14254,THE ARGUMENT.,Is it becoming of the due respect
14255,THE ARGUMENT.,"And awful honour of a god elect,"
14256,THE ARGUMENT.,"A wound unworthy of our state to feel,"
14257,THE ARGUMENT.,Patient of human hands and earthly steel?
14258,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or seems it just, the sister should restore"
14259,THE ARGUMENT.,"A second sword, when one was lost before,"
14260,THE ARGUMENT.,And arm a conquer’d wretch against his conqueror?
14261,THE ARGUMENT.,"For what, without thy knowledge and avow,"
14262,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nay more, thy dictate, durst Juturna do?"
14263,THE ARGUMENT.,"At last, in deference to my love, forbear"
14264,THE ARGUMENT.,To lodge within thy soul this anxious care;
14265,THE ARGUMENT.,"Reclin’d upon my breast, thy grief unload:"
14266,THE ARGUMENT.,"Who should relieve the goddess, but the god?"
14267,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now all things to their utmost issue tend,"
14268,THE ARGUMENT.,Push’d by the Fates to their appointed end.
14269,THE ARGUMENT.,"While leave was giv’n thee, and a lawful hour"
14270,THE ARGUMENT.,"For vengeance, wrath, and unresisted pow’r,"
14271,THE ARGUMENT.,"Toss’d on the seas, thou couldst thy foes distress,"
14272,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, driv’n ashore, with hostile arms oppress;"
14273,THE ARGUMENT.,"Deform the royal house; and, from the side"
14274,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of the just bridegroom, tear the plighted bride:"
14275,THE ARGUMENT.,Now cease at my command.” The Thund’rer said;
14276,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, with dejected eyes, this answer Juno made:"
14277,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Because your dread decree too well I knew,"
14278,THE ARGUMENT.,From Turnus and from earth unwilling I withdrew.
14279,THE ARGUMENT.,"Else should you not behold me here, alone,"
14280,THE ARGUMENT.,"Involv’d in empty clouds, my friends bemoan,"
14281,THE ARGUMENT.,"But, girt with vengeful flames, in open sight"
14282,THE ARGUMENT.,Engag’d against my foes in mortal fight.
14283,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Tis true, Juturna mingled in the strife"
14284,THE ARGUMENT.,"By my command, to save her brother’s life,"
14285,THE ARGUMENT.,"At least to try; but, by the Stygian lake,"
14286,THE ARGUMENT.,"(The most religious oath the gods can take,)"
14287,THE ARGUMENT.,"With this restriction, not to bend the bow,"
14288,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or toss the spear, or trembling dart to throw."
14289,THE ARGUMENT.,"And now, resign’d to your superior might,"
14290,THE ARGUMENT.,"And tir’d with fruitless toils, I loathe the fight."
14291,THE ARGUMENT.,This let me beg (and this no fates withstand)
14292,THE ARGUMENT.,"Both for myself and for your father’s land,"
14293,THE ARGUMENT.,"That, when the nuptial bed shall bind the peace,"
14294,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Which I, since you ordain, consent to bless,)"
14295,THE ARGUMENT.,The laws of either nation be the same;
14296,THE ARGUMENT.,"But let the Latins still retain their name,"
14297,THE ARGUMENT.,"Speak the same language which they spoke before,"
14298,THE ARGUMENT.,Wear the same habits which their grandsires wore.
14299,THE ARGUMENT.,Call them not Trojans: perish the renown
14300,THE ARGUMENT.,"And name of Troy, with that detested town."
14301,THE ARGUMENT.,Latium be Latium still; let Alba reign
14302,THE ARGUMENT.,And Rome’s immortal majesty remain.”
14303,THE ARGUMENT.,
14304,THE ARGUMENT.,Then thus the founder of mankind replies
14305,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Unruffled was his front, serene his eyes)"
14306,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Can Saturn’s issue, and heav’n’s other heir,"
14307,THE ARGUMENT.,Such endless anger in her bosom bear?
14308,THE ARGUMENT.,"Be mistress, and your full desires obtain;"
14309,THE ARGUMENT.,But quench the choler you foment in vain.
14310,THE ARGUMENT.,"From ancient blood th’ Ausonian people sprung,"
14311,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shall keep their name, their habit, and their tongue."
14312,THE ARGUMENT.,The Trojans to their customs shall be tied:
14313,THE ARGUMENT.,"I will, myself, their common rites provide;"
14314,THE ARGUMENT.,"The natives shall command, the foreigners subside."
14315,THE ARGUMENT.,All shall be Latium; Troy without a name;
14316,THE ARGUMENT.,And her lost sons forget from whence they came.
14317,THE ARGUMENT.,"From blood so mix’d, a pious race shall flow,"
14318,THE ARGUMENT.,"Equal to gods, excelling all below."
14319,THE ARGUMENT.,"No nation more respect to you shall pay,"
14320,THE ARGUMENT.,Or greater off’rings on your altars lay.”
14321,THE ARGUMENT.,"Juno consents, well pleas’d that her desires"
14322,THE ARGUMENT.,"Had found success, and from the cloud retires."
14323,THE ARGUMENT.,
14324,THE ARGUMENT.,"The peace thus made, the Thund’rer next prepares"
14325,THE ARGUMENT.,To force the wat’ry goddess from the wars.
14326,THE ARGUMENT.,"Deep in the dismal regions void of light,"
14327,THE ARGUMENT.,Three daughters at a birth were born to Night:
14328,THE ARGUMENT.,"These their brown mother, brooding on her care,"
14329,THE ARGUMENT.,"Indued with windy wings to flit in air,"
14330,THE ARGUMENT.,"With serpents girt alike, and crown’d with hissing hair."
14331,THE ARGUMENT.,"In heav’n the Dirae call’d, and still at hand,"
14332,THE ARGUMENT.,"Before the throne of angry Jove they stand,"
14333,THE ARGUMENT.,"His ministers of wrath, and ready still"
14334,THE ARGUMENT.,"The minds of mortal men with fears to fill,"
14335,THE ARGUMENT.,"Whene’er the moody sire, to wreak his hate"
14336,THE ARGUMENT.,"On realms or towns deserving of their fate,"
14337,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hurls down diseases, death and deadly care,"
14338,THE ARGUMENT.,And terrifies the guilty world with war.
14339,THE ARGUMENT.,"One sister plague if these from heav’n he sent,"
14340,THE ARGUMENT.,To fright Juturna with a dire portent.
14341,THE ARGUMENT.,The pest comes whirling down: by far more slow
14342,THE ARGUMENT.,"Springs the swift arrow from the Parthian bow,"
14343,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or Cydon yew, when, traversing the skies,"
14344,THE ARGUMENT.,"And drench’d in pois’nous juice, the sure destruction flies."
14345,THE ARGUMENT.,With such a sudden and unseen a flight
14346,THE ARGUMENT.,Shot thro’ the clouds the daughter of the night.
14347,THE ARGUMENT.,"Soon as the field inclos’d she had in view,"
14348,THE ARGUMENT.,"And from afar her destin’d quarry knew,"
14349,THE ARGUMENT.,"Contracted, to the boding bird she turns,"
14350,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which haunts the ruin’d piles and hallow’d urns,"
14351,THE ARGUMENT.,"And beats about the tombs with nightly wings,"
14352,THE ARGUMENT.,Where songs obscene on sepulchers she sings.
14353,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus lessen’d in her form, with frightful cries"
14354,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Fury round unhappy Turnus flies,"
14355,THE ARGUMENT.,"Flaps on his shield, and flutters o’er his eyes."
14356,THE ARGUMENT.,
14357,THE ARGUMENT.,A lazy chillness crept along his blood;
14358,THE ARGUMENT.,Chok’d was his voice; his hair with horror stood.
14359,THE ARGUMENT.,"Juturna from afar beheld her fly,"
14360,THE ARGUMENT.,"And knew th’ ill omen, by her screaming cry"
14361,THE ARGUMENT.,"And stridor of her wings. Amaz’d with fear,"
14362,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her beauteous breast she beat, and rent her flowing hair."
14363,THE ARGUMENT.,
14364,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Ah me!” she cries, “in this unequal strife"
14365,THE ARGUMENT.,What can thy sister more to save thy life?
14366,THE ARGUMENT.,"Weak as I am, can I, alas! contend"
14367,THE ARGUMENT.,In arms with that inexorable fiend?
14368,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now, now, I quit the field! forbear to fright"
14369,THE ARGUMENT.,"My tender soul, ye baleful birds of night;"
14370,THE ARGUMENT.,"The lashing of your wings I know too well,"
14371,THE ARGUMENT.,"The sounding flight, and fun’ral screams of hell!"
14372,THE ARGUMENT.,"These are the gifts you bring from haughty Jove,"
14373,THE ARGUMENT.,The worthy recompense of ravish’d love!
14374,THE ARGUMENT.,Did he for this exempt my life from fate?
14375,THE ARGUMENT.,"O hard conditions of immortal state,"
14376,THE ARGUMENT.,"Tho’ born to death, not privileg’d to die,"
14377,THE ARGUMENT.,But forc’d to bear impos’d eternity!
14378,THE ARGUMENT.,"Take back your envious bribes, and let me go"
14379,THE ARGUMENT.,Companion to my brother’s ghost below!
14380,THE ARGUMENT.,"The joys are vanish’d: nothing now remains,"
14381,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of life immortal, but immortal pains."
14382,THE ARGUMENT.,"What earth will open her devouring womb,"
14383,THE ARGUMENT.,To rest a weary goddess in the tomb!”
14384,THE ARGUMENT.,"She drew a length of sighs; nor more she said,"
14385,THE ARGUMENT.,"But in her azure mantle wrapp’d her head,"
14386,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then plung’d into her stream, with deep despair,"
14387,THE ARGUMENT.,And her last sobs came bubbling up in air.
14388,THE ARGUMENT.,
14389,THE ARGUMENT.,Now stern Aeneas waves his weighty spear
14390,THE ARGUMENT.,"Against his foe, and thus upbraids his fear:"
14391,THE ARGUMENT.,“What farther subterfuge can Turnus find?
14392,THE ARGUMENT.,What empty hopes are harbour’d in his mind?
14393,THE ARGUMENT.,’Tis not thy swiftness can secure thy flight;
14394,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not with their feet, but hands, the valiant fight."
14395,THE ARGUMENT.,"Vary thy shape in thousand forms, and dare"
14396,THE ARGUMENT.,What skill and courage can attempt in war;
14397,THE ARGUMENT.,"Wish for the wings of winds, to mount the sky;"
14398,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or hid, within the hollow earth to lie!”"
14399,THE ARGUMENT.,"The champion shook his head, and made this short reply:"
14400,THE ARGUMENT.,“No threats of thine my manly mind can move;
14401,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Tis hostile heav’n I dread, and partial Jove.”"
14402,THE ARGUMENT.,"He said no more, but, with a sigh, repress’d"
14403,THE ARGUMENT.,The mighty sorrow in his swelling breast.
14404,THE ARGUMENT.,
14405,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, as he roll’d his troubled eyes around,"
14406,THE ARGUMENT.,"An antique stone he saw, the common bound"
14407,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of neighb’ring fields, and barrier of the ground;"
14408,THE ARGUMENT.,"So vast, that twelve strong men of modern days"
14409,THE ARGUMENT.,Th’ enormous weight from earth could hardly raise.
14410,THE ARGUMENT.,"He heav’d it at a lift, and, pois’d on high,"
14411,THE ARGUMENT.,"Ran stagg’ring on against his enemy,"
14412,THE ARGUMENT.,"But so disorder’d, that he scarcely knew"
14413,THE ARGUMENT.,"His way, or what unwieldly weight he threw."
14414,THE ARGUMENT.,"His knocking knees are bent beneath the load,"
14415,THE ARGUMENT.,And shiv’ring cold congeals his vital blood.
14416,THE ARGUMENT.,"The stone drops from his arms, and, falling short"
14417,THE ARGUMENT.,"For want of vigour, mocks his vain effort."
14418,THE ARGUMENT.,"And as, when heavy sleep has clos’d the sight,"
14419,THE ARGUMENT.,The sickly fancy labours in the night;
14420,THE ARGUMENT.,"We seem to run; and, destitute of force,"
14421,THE ARGUMENT.,Our sinking limbs forsake us in the course:
14422,THE ARGUMENT.,In vain we heave for breath; in vain we cry;
14423,THE ARGUMENT.,"The nerves, unbrac’d, their usual strength deny;"
14424,THE ARGUMENT.,And on the tongue the falt’ring accents die:
14425,THE ARGUMENT.,"So Turnus far’d; whatever means he tried,"
14426,THE ARGUMENT.,"All force of arms and points of art employ’d,"
14427,THE ARGUMENT.,"The Fury flew athwart, and made th’ endeavor void."
14428,THE ARGUMENT.,
14429,THE ARGUMENT.,A thousand various thoughts his soul confound;
14430,THE ARGUMENT.,"He star’d about, nor aid nor issue found;"
14431,THE ARGUMENT.,"His own men stop the pass, and his own walls surround."
14432,THE ARGUMENT.,"Once more he pauses, and looks out again,"
14433,THE ARGUMENT.,And seeks the goddess charioteer in vain.
14434,THE ARGUMENT.,"Trembling he views the thund’ring chief advance,"
14435,THE ARGUMENT.,And brandishing aloft the deadly lance:
14436,THE ARGUMENT.,"Amaz’d he cow’rs beneath his conqu’ring foe,"
14437,THE ARGUMENT.,"Forgets to ward, and waits the coming blow."
14438,THE ARGUMENT.,"Astonish’d while he stands, and fix’d with fear,"
14439,THE ARGUMENT.,Aim’d at his shield he sees th’ impending spear.
14440,THE ARGUMENT.,
14441,THE ARGUMENT.,"The hero measur’d first, with narrow view,"
14442,THE ARGUMENT.,"The destin’d mark; and, rising as he threw,"
14443,THE ARGUMENT.,With its full swing the fatal weapon flew.
14444,THE ARGUMENT.,"Not with less rage the rattling thunder falls,"
14445,THE ARGUMENT.,Or stones from batt’ring-engines break the walls:
14446,THE ARGUMENT.,"Swift as a whirlwind, from an arm so strong,"
14447,THE ARGUMENT.,"The lance drove on, and bore the death along."
14448,THE ARGUMENT.,"Naught could his sev’nfold shield the prince avail,"
14449,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor aught, beneath his arms, the coat of mail:"
14450,THE ARGUMENT.,"It pierc’d thro’ all, and with a grisly wound"
14451,THE ARGUMENT.,"Transfix’d his thigh, and doubled him to ground."
14452,THE ARGUMENT.,With groans the Latins rend the vaulted sky:
14453,THE ARGUMENT.,"Woods, hills, and valleys, to the voice reply."
14454,THE ARGUMENT.,
14455,THE ARGUMENT.,"Now low on earth the lofty chief is laid,"
14456,THE ARGUMENT.,"With eyes cast upward, and with arms display’d,"
14457,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, recreant, thus to the proud victor pray’d:"
14458,THE ARGUMENT.,"“I know my death deserv’d, nor hope to live:"
14459,THE ARGUMENT.,Use what the gods and thy good fortune give.
14460,THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet think, O think, if mercy may be shown,"
14461,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thou hadst a father once, and hast a son."
14462,THE ARGUMENT.,"Pity my sire, now sinking to the grave;"
14463,THE ARGUMENT.,And for Anchises’ sake old Daunus save!
14464,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or, if thy vow’d revenge pursue my death,"
14465,THE ARGUMENT.,Give to my friends my body void of breath!
14466,THE ARGUMENT.,The Latian chiefs have seen me beg my life;
14467,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thine is the conquest, thine the royal wife:"
14468,THE ARGUMENT.,"Against a yielded man, ’tis mean ignoble strife.”"
14469,THE ARGUMENT.,
14470,THE ARGUMENT.,"In deep suspense the Trojan seem’d to stand,"
14471,THE ARGUMENT.,"And, just prepar’d to strike, repress’d his hand."
14472,THE ARGUMENT.,"He roll’d his eyes, and ev’ry moment felt"
14473,THE ARGUMENT.,His manly soul with more compassion melt;
14474,THE ARGUMENT.,"When, casting down a casual glance, he spied"
14475,THE ARGUMENT.,"The golden belt that glitter’d on his side,"
14476,THE ARGUMENT.,The fatal spoils which haughty Turnus tore
14477,THE ARGUMENT.,"From dying Pallas, and in triumph wore."
14478,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, rous’d anew to wrath, he loudly cries"
14479,THE ARGUMENT.,"(Flames, while he spoke, came flashing from his eyes)"
14480,THE ARGUMENT.,"“Traitor, dost thou, dost thou to grace pretend,"
14481,THE ARGUMENT.,"Clad, as thou art, in trophies of my friend?"
14482,THE ARGUMENT.,To his sad soul a grateful off’ring go!
14483,THE ARGUMENT.,"’Tis Pallas, Pallas gives this deadly blow.”"
14484,THE ARGUMENT.,"He rais’d his arm aloft, and, at the word,"
14485,THE ARGUMENT.,Deep in his bosom drove the shining sword.
14486,THE ARGUMENT.,The streaming blood distain’d his arms around;
14487,THE ARGUMENT.,And the disdainful soul came rushing through the wound.
