66,INTRODUCTION,
67,INTRODUCTION,"Virgil’s Aeneid is, of course, a major poem; it is also a great and"
68,INTRODUCTION,"beautiful one. The scope of an epic requires, in the writing, a designed"
69,INTRODUCTION,"variety, a calculated unevenness, now and then some easy-going"
70,INTRODUCTION,"carelessness. So the reader win find, here and there, transitional"
71,INTRODUCTION,"passages, the stock epithet, the conventional phrase, a few lines of"
72,INTRODUCTION,"vamping, and, in this or that line, what the Spanish call _ripios_. Over"
73,INTRODUCTION,"and above these matters of small detail, in the large panorama the"
74,INTRODUCTION,"reader will find valleys as well as peaks, dry ravines as well as upland"
75,INTRODUCTION,"meadows: the landscape is not always the same height above sea level,"
76,INTRODUCTION,and its flora and fauna vary more than a little. The epic terrain of the
77,INTRODUCTION,"Odyssey differs greatly from that of the Iliad, and both Iliad and"
78,INTRODUCTION,"Odyssey differ from the Aeneid, but there is nothing obtrusive in"
79,INTRODUCTION,Virgil’s relatively studied concern with composition. Less wild and
80,INTRODUCTION,"“natural,” the demesnes of the Aeneid have their full measure of more"
81,INTRODUCTION,"than pleasant countryside, loftiness also, majesty, grandeur."
82,INTRODUCTION,
83,INTRODUCTION,"Virgil, we have been told, wanted to burn the Aeneid; he was not"
84,INTRODUCTION,"satisfied with it. This attitude, it seems to me, reflects fatigue and"
85,INTRODUCTION,exhaustion of spirit rather than considered literary judgment. The last
86,INTRODUCTION,"revisions are always the most enervating, and Virgil, one can well"
87,INTRODUCTION,"believe, having worked on the poem for over a decade, had reached the"
88,INTRODUCTION,"point where he felt he would rather do anything, including die, than go"
89,INTRODUCTION,over the poem one more time. If we had never known the poem was believed
90,INTRODUCTION,"incomplete, we would, I think, find it difficult to decide which were"
91,INTRODUCTION,"the unsatisfactory portions. Who wants an epic poem absolutely perfect,"
92,INTRODUCTION,"anyway? and how could the Aeneid be improved, really?"
93,INTRODUCTION,
94,INTRODUCTION,A charge is brought against the Aeneid that it is propaganda. I do not
95,INTRODUCTION,know when this criticism first came to be brought; I suspect it is only
96,INTRODUCTION,"our own time, with its persistent devotion to all the aspects of"
97,INTRODUCTION,"advertising and sloganeering, that feels sufficiently guilty about these"
98,INTRODUCTION,"activities to project the accusation across twenty centuries. Virgil,"
99,INTRODUCTION,"with whatever cheerfulness his nature was capable of, would readily have"
100,INTRODUCTION,agreed that the Aeneid was propaganda; but then he did not know the
101,INTRODUCTION,"invidious connotations of the word,--he would have taken it to mean only"
102,INTRODUCTION,“things that ought to be propagated.” An institute of propaganda
103,INTRODUCTION,analysis would be completely baffled by the Aeneid; the conclusion might
104,INTRODUCTION,be that the poem was either the best or the worst propaganda that had
105,INTRODUCTION,ever been written. What kind of propaganda is it to begin a nationalist
106,INTRODUCTION,"epic with the sorrowful sigh, “It was such a great burden,--a millstone"
107,INTRODUCTION,around the neck--to found the Roman race”? What kind of propaganda is it
108,INTRODUCTION,"to make the enemies, by and large, more interesting and sympathetic and"
109,INTRODUCTION,"colorful fellows than our own side? Lausus and Mezentius, for example,"
110,INTRODUCTION,"are a far more engaging father-and-son combination than Aeneas-Anchises,"
111,INTRODUCTION,"Aeneas-Ascanius, or Evander-Pallas. Dido and Camilla command our"
112,INTRODUCTION,admiration much more than the blushing Lavinia or the fading Creusa. We
113,INTRODUCTION,"respond to Turnus, and are at best coldly respectful to Aeneas. What"
114,INTRODUCTION,"goes on here, anyway? Shouldn’t some patriotic organization investigate"
115,INTRODUCTION,"this subversive writer, secretly in the pay of a foreign power? On the"
116,INTRODUCTION,"other hand, it is just possible that this is the very best form which"
117,INTRODUCTION,"national propaganda can take, the implicit and pervasive doctrine that"
118,INTRODUCTION,"great and good as our enemies may be, we can admire them, surpass them,"
119,INTRODUCTION,"be just to them, and not be afraid of them, either."
120,INTRODUCTION,
121,INTRODUCTION,A word or two about the character of Aeneas. It may be that the trouble
122,INTRODUCTION,with him is really the trouble with us. We are not mature enough to
123,INTRODUCTION,"accept, as epic hero, a man who is imaginative, sensitive, compassionate"
124,INTRODUCTION,"(everywhere except in parts of Books IV and X), and, in short,"
125,INTRODUCTION,"civilized; in other words, a paradox. There seems to be almost no"
126,INTRODUCTION,aggression at all in the character of Aeneas: even in his dreams he
127,INTRODUCTION,wants to get out of trouble and avoid fighting. We don’t like this; we
128,INTRODUCTION,"find most satisfactory those moments when he is telling Dido off, or"
129,INTRODUCTION,"making bitter sarcastic speeches at Lucagus and Liger. We object,"
130,INTRODUCTION,"further, that when he does fight, he knows very well that he is"
131,INTRODUCTION,protected by the gods and by magic armor. (Yet we do not mind the latter
132,INTRODUCTION,"in the case of, for instance, Superman; and would we rather have our"
133,INTRODUCTION,"hero sponsored by devils?) In the matter of invulnerability we are, I"
134,INTRODUCTION,"think, a little unjust: Virgil takes some pains to show that he can be"
135,INTRODUCTION,"hurt: he rushes in, unarmed, to preserve the truce; he is grievously"
136,INTRODUCTION,"wounded by the death of Pallas. In any event, we need not feel too"
137,INTRODUCTION,guilty if we are not crazy about Aeneas; there is little in the record
138,INTRODUCTION,"to show that the Romans left enthusiastic encomia, either."
139,INTRODUCTION,
140,INTRODUCTION,"As between Virgil and Homer, there can be no real comparison. Judged by"
141,INTRODUCTION,"any standard, Homer is the greater writer; judged by our own, Virgil is"
142,INTRODUCTION,sometimes the better one. His immediate audience consisted of men much
143,INTRODUCTION,more like ourselves than did Homer’s; and Virgil is considerate of their
144,INTRODUCTION,special sensitivities in a way that Homer did not have to bother to be.
145,INTRODUCTION,"What he thought he might require of Homer, of course he went and took;"
146,INTRODUCTION,"it seems to me that in the taking he always modifies, often, from our"
147,INTRODUCTION,"point of view, improves. He will, for one thing, always design and order"
148,INTRODUCTION,"more carefully: Book VI, for example, is much more artistically worked"
149,INTRODUCTION,out than the descent to the dead in the Odyssey. And the games in Book
150,INTRODUCTION,"V, though many details are lifted entire from the Iliad, have quite"
151,INTRODUCTION,"their own quality, a light-heartedness in the horseplay, a humor and"
152,INTRODUCTION,gaiety entirely different from the uncouth bragging and brawling of the
153,INTRODUCTION,Homeric competitors. I think it is only literary scholars who could
154,INTRODUCTION,possibly look down their noses at this book. And in his scenes and
155,INTRODUCTION,"stories of battle Virgil, it seems to me, is far more respectful to the"
156,INTRODUCTION,modern reader’s sense of credulity than Homer is; no student of a work
157,INTRODUCTION,"rather current in 1917, _Small Problems of Infantry_, would have any"
158,INTRODUCTION,difficulty in understanding what went wrong with the mission of Nisus
159,INTRODUCTION,and Euryalus in Book IX.
160,INTRODUCTION,
161,INTRODUCTION,"It is too bad that the Aeneid, as a whole, is not better known in"
162,INTRODUCTION,America. The general practice in our secondary schools has come to be
163,INTRODUCTION,"that of reading Books I, II, IV, and VI, and that’s all. This seems to"
164,INTRODUCTION,"me a peculiar way to deal with a work of art, like looking at selected"
165,INTRODUCTION,portions of the Venus of Milo. I do not see how any intelligent American
166,INTRODUCTION,"boys or girls can go this slowly, unless they stop to scan every line,"
167,INTRODUCTION,"note every example of synecdoche or synizesis, and parse all the"
168,INTRODUCTION,"grammatical constructions, with special attention to the poetical dative"
169,INTRODUCTION,of agent and the Greek middle voice accusative of respect. And where the
170,INTRODUCTION,impression grew that the last six books are inferior in interest to the
171,INTRODUCTION,"first I do not understand. Virgil, for one, did not think so. _Maius"
172,INTRODUCTION,opus moveo._
173,INTRODUCTION,
174,INTRODUCTION,"It is a peculiar, paradoxical kind of great poem, this Aeneid. For us, I"
175,INTRODUCTION,"think, its greatness can be found in ways that may have had less appeal"
176,INTRODUCTION,"to the Roman mind. Its references may mean less, its music more. Not"
177,INTRODUCTION,"only the music of the lines, but the music of the whole: this is a"
178,INTRODUCTION,"composition, and the pleasure comes in listening to it as one would to a"
179,INTRODUCTION,"great symphony (and not too much attention, please, to the program"
180,INTRODUCTION,"notes). This is a composition, the Aeneid, beautifully wrought,"
181,INTRODUCTION,beautifully balanced. Professor Conway has written an illuminating essay
182,INTRODUCTION,"dealing with the poem in terms of its architecture; in detail, his"
183,INTRODUCTION,"analysis is excellent, but the central metaphor is a little unhappy if"
184,INTRODUCTION,"it leads you to envisage the Aeneid as an impressive pile, frozen and"
185,INTRODUCTION,"static. The poem _moves_, in more senses than one: the thing to do is to"
186,INTRODUCTION,feel it and listen to it. Hear how the themes vary and recur; how the
187,INTRODUCTION,"tone lightens and darkens, the volume swells or dies, the tempo rushes"
188,INTRODUCTION,"or lingers. Take in the poem with the mind, to be sure; take it in with"
189,INTRODUCTION,"the eye as well; but above all, hearken to it with the ear."
190,INTRODUCTION,
191,INTRODUCTION,This translation is a quick and unscrupulous job. I am not being modest:
192,INTRODUCTION,"a modest man would never have started, and a scrupulous one never"
193,INTRODUCTION,"finished. I have, nevertheless, been not entirely without principles. I"
194,INTRODUCTION,"have been trying to translate the poem, rather than transliterate its"
195,INTRODUCTION,"words. In doing so, I have transposed lines, cut some proper names and"
196,INTRODUCTION,allusions where I thought they would excessively slow down reader
197,INTRODUCTION,"interest, substituted the general for the specific or the specific for"
198,INTRODUCTION,"the general, and in short taken all kinds of liberties, such as no pure"
199,INTRODUCTION,scholar could possibly approve. But I doubt if there is any such thing
200,INTRODUCTION,"as an absolutely pure scholar, anyhow. A loose iambic pentameter has"
201,INTRODUCTION,"seemed to me the most convenient medium, though in some passages, where"
202,INTRODUCTION,"the tempo runs faster, you might not recognize it; and I have, by no"
203,INTRODUCTION,"means faithfully following Virgil, occasionally used his device of the"
204,INTRODUCTION,half-line. I have preferred solecisms to archaisms: thus I have never
205,INTRODUCTION,used the second person singular pronoun. I know I have committed
206,INTRODUCTION,"anachronisms, but, then, I know Virgil did too, and I have, in my"
207,INTRODUCTION,"opinion heroically, resisted one or two obvious temptations in this"
208,INTRODUCTION,regard. What I have tried to be faithful to is the meaning of the poem
209,INTRODUCTION,"as I understand it, to make it sound to you, wherever I can, the way it"
210,INTRODUCTION,"feels to me. Working on it, I have been impressed, more than ever"
211,INTRODUCTION,"through the thirty-odd years I have read it, by its richness and"
212,INTRODUCTION,"variety: to mention only one point, the famous Virgilian melancholy, the"
213,INTRODUCTION,"tone of _Sunt lacrimae rerum_, is, I begin to notice, a recurring, not"
214,INTRODUCTION,"a sustained, theme. There is much more rugged and rough, harsh and"
215,INTRODUCTION,"bitter, music in Virgil than you might suspect if you have only read"
216,INTRODUCTION,_about_ him. A recent essay by Mark Van Doren has given me considerable
217,INTRODUCTION,heart in offering this new translation: there is a kind of scholastic
218,INTRODUCTION,"snobbishness, he points out, in the insistence that no man knows"
219,INTRODUCTION,"anything who has not read the classics in the original. It is better, no"
220,INTRODUCTION,"doubt, to read Virgil in his own Latin, but still--I hope some people"
221,INTRODUCTION,"may have some pleasure of him, some idea of how good he was, through"
222,INTRODUCTION,this English arrangement.

386,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Soothing, restraining, their passionate proud spirit,"
387,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Lest, uncontrolled, they seize, in their wild keeping,"
388,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The land, the sea, the arch of sky, in ruin"
389,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Sweeping through space. This Jupiter feared; he hid them
390,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Deep in dark caverns, with a mass of mountain"
391,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Piled over above them, and a king to give them"
392,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Most certain regulation, with a knowledge"
393,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"When to hold in, when to let go. Him Juno"
394,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Approached in supplication:--“Aeolus,"
395,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Given by Jove the power to still the waters,"
396,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Or raise them with a gale, a tribe I hate"
397,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Is on its way to Italy, and they carry"
398,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Troy with them, and their household gods, once beaten."
399,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Shake anger into those winds of yours, turn over"
400,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Their ships, and drown them; drive them in all directions,"
401,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Litter the sea with bodies! For such service
402,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The loveliest nymph I have, Deiopea,"
403,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Shall be your bride forever, and you will father"
404,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Fair children on her fairness.” Aeolus
405,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Made answer: “Yours, O Queen, the task of seeking"
406,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Whatever it is you will; and mine the duty
407,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"To follow with performance. All my empire,"
408,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"My sceptre, Jove’s indulgence, are beholden"
409,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"To Juno’s favor, by whose blessing I"
410,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Attend the feasts of the gods and rule this storm-land.”
411,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,
412,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"His spear-butt struck the hollow mountain-side,"
413,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And the winds, wherever they could, came sweeping forth,"
414,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Whirled over the land, swooped down upon the ocean."
415,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"East, South, Southwest, they heave the billows, howl,"
416,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Storm, roll the giant combers toward the shore."
417,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Men cry; the rigging creaks and strains; the clouds
418,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Darken, and men see nothing; a weight of darkness"
419,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Broods over the deep; the heavy thunder rumbles
420,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,From pole to pole; the lightning rips and dazzles;
421,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,There is no way out but death. Aeneas shudders
422,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"In the chill shock, and lifts both hands to heaven:--"
423,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"“O happy men, thrice happy, four times happy,"
424,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Who had the luck to die, with their fathers watching"
425,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Below the walls of Troy! Ah, Diomedes,"
426,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Bravest of Greeks, why could I not have fallen,"
427,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Bleeding my life away on plains of Ilium
428,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"In our encounter there, where mighty Hector"
429,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Went down before Achilles’ spear, and huge"
430,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Sarpedon lay in dust, and Simois river"
431,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Rolled to the sea so many noble heroes,"
432,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,All drowned in all their armor?” And the gale
433,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Howls from the north, striking the sail, head on;"
434,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,The waves are lifted to the stars; the oars
435,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Are broken, and the prow slews round; the ship"
436,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Lies broadside on; a wall of water, a mountain,"
437,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Looms up, comes pouring down; some ride the crest,"
438,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Some, in the trough, can see the boil of the sand."
439,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The South wind hurls three ships on the hidden rocks,"
440,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,That sea-reef which Italians call the Altars;
441,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The West takes three, sweeping them from the deep"
442,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"On shoal and quicksand; over the stern of one,"
443,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Before Aeneas’ eyes, a great sea falls,"
444,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Washing the helmsman overboard; the ship
445,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Whirls thrice in the suck of the water and goes down
446,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,In the devouring gulf; and here and there
447,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"A few survivors swim, the Lycian men"
448,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Whose captain was Orontes; now their arms,"
449,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Their Trojan treasures, float with the broken timbers"
450,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"On the swing and slide of the waves. The storm, triumphant,"
451,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Rides down more boats, and more; there goes Achates;"
452,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Abas, Aletes, Ilioneus,"
453,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Receive the hostile water; the walls are broken;
454,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,The enemy pours in.
455,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,
456,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,But meanwhile Neptune
457,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Saw ocean in a welter of confusion,"
458,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The roar of storm, and deep and surface mingled."
459,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Troublesome business, this; he rose, majestic,"
460,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"From under the waves, and saw the Trojan vessels"
461,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Scattered all over the sea by the might of the waves
462,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,And the wreck of sky; he recognized the anger
463,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And cunning of his sister, and he summoned"
464,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The winds by name:--“What arrogance is this,"
465,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"What pride of birth, you winds, to meddle here"
466,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Without my sanction, raising all this trouble?"
467,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"I’ll--No, the waves come first: but listen to me,"
468,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,You are going to pay for this! Get out of here!
469,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Go tell your king the lordship of the ocean,"
470,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The trident, are not his, but mine. His realm"
471,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Reaches no further than the rocks and caverns
472,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"You brawlers dwell in; let him rule that palace,"
473,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Big as he pleases, shut you in, and stay there!”"
474,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,
475,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"This said, he calmed the swollen sea and cloud,"
476,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Brought back the sun; Cymothoe and Triton,"
477,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Heaving together, pulled the ships from the reef,"
478,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"As Neptune used his trident for a lever,"
479,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Opened the quicksand, made the water smooth,"
480,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,And the flying chariot skimmed the level surface.
481,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Sometimes, in a great nation, there are riots"
482,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"With the rabble out of hand, and firebrands fly"
483,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,And cobblestones; whatever they lay their hands on
484,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Is a weapon for their fury, but should they see"
485,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"One man of noble presence, they fall silent,"
486,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Obedient dogs, with ears pricked up, and waiting,"
487,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Waiting his word, and he knows how to bring them"
488,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Back to good sense again. So ocean, roaring,"
489,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Subsided into stillness, as the sea-god"
490,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Looked forth upon the waters, and clear weather"
491,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Shone over him as he drove his flying horses.
492,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,
493,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Aeneas’ weary children make for harbor,"
494,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Whichever lies most near, and the prows are turned"
495,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,To Libya’s coast-line. In a bay’s deep curve
496,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"They find a haven, where the water lies"
497,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,With never a ripple. A little island keeps
498,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The sea-swell off, and the waves break on its sides"
499,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,And slide back harmless. The great cliffs come down
500,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Steep to deep water, and the background shimmers,"
501,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Darkens and shines, the tremulous aspen moving"
502,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,And the dark fir pointing still. And there is a cave
503,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Under the overhanging rocks, alive"
504,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"With water running fresh, a home of the Nymphs,"
505,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"With benches for them, cut from the living stone."
506,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"No anchor is needed here for weary ships,"
507,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"No mooring-cable. Aeneas brings them in,"
508,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Seven weary vessels, and the men are glad"
509,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"To be ashore again, to feel dry sand"
510,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Under the salt-stained limbs. Achates strikes
511,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The spark from the flint, catches the fire on leaves,"
512,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Adds chips and kindling, blows and fans the flame,"
513,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And they bring out the soaked and salty corn,"
514,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The hand-mills, stone and mortar, and make ready,"
515,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"As best they can, for bread."
516,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,
517,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Meanwhile Aeneas
518,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Climbs to a look-out, for a view of the ocean,"
519,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Hoping for some good luck; the Phrygian galleys
520,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Might meet his gaze, or Capys’ boats, or a pennon"
521,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"On a far-off mast-head flying. There is nothing,"
522,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Nothing to see out yonder, but near the water"
523,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Three stags are grazing, with a herd behind them,"
524,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,A long line browsing through the peaceful valley.
525,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,He reaches for the bow and the swift arrows
526,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Borne by Achates, and he shoots the leaders,"
527,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"High-antlered, routs the common herd, and ceases"
528,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Only when seven are slain, a number equal"
529,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"To the ships’ tally, and then he seeks the harbor,"
530,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Divides the spoil, broaches the wine Acestes"
531,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Had stowed for them at Drepanum on their leaving,"
532,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"A kingly present, and he calms their trouble,"
533,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Saying: “O comrades, we have been through evil"
534,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Together before this; we have been through worse,"
535,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Scylla, Charybdis, and the Cyclops’ dwelling,"
536,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The sounding rocks. This, too, the god will end."
537,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Call the nerve back; dismiss the fear, the sadness."
538,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Some day, perhaps, remembering even this"
539,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Will be a pleasure. We are going on
540,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Through whatsoever chance and change, until"
541,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"We come to Latium, where the fates point out"
542,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"A quiet dwelling-place, and Troy recovered."
543,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Endure, and keep yourself for better days.”"
544,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"He kept to himself the sorrow in the heart,"
545,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Wearing, for them, a mask of hopefulness."
546,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,They were ready for the feasting. Part lay bare
547,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The flesh from the torn hides, part cut the meat"
548,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Impaling it, still quivering, on spits,"
549,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Setting the kettles, keeping the water boiling,"
550,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And strong with food again, sprawling stretched out"
551,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"On comfortable grass, they take their fill"
552,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Of bread and wine and venison, till hunger"
553,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Is gone, and the board cleared. And then they talk"
554,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"For a long time, of where their comrades are,"
555,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Are, or may be, hopeful and doubtful both."
556,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Could they believe them living? or would a cry
557,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Fall on deaf ears forever? All those captains,"
558,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Brave Gyas, brave Cloanthus, Amycus,"
559,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Lycus, Orontes,--in his secret heart"
560,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Aeneas mourns them.
561,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,
562,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Meanwhile, from the heaven"
563,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Jupiter watched the lands below, and the seas"
564,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"With the white points of sails, and far-off people,"
565,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Turning his gaze toward Libya. And Venus
566,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Came to him then, a little sadly, tears"
567,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Brimming in those bright eyes of hers. “Great father,”"
568,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"She said, “Great ruler of the world"
569,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Of men and gods, great wielder of the lightning,"
570,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,What has my poor Aeneas done? what outrage
571,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Could Trojans perpetrate, so that the world"
572,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Rejects them everywhere, and many a death"
573,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Inflicted on them over Italy?
574,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"There was a promise once, that as the years"
575,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Rolled onward, they would father Rome and rulers"
576,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Of Roman stock, to hold dominion over"
577,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"All sea and land. That was a promise, father;"
578,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,What changed it? Once that promise was my comfort;
579,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Troy fell; I weighed one fate against another
580,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,And found some consolation. But disaster
581,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Keeps on; the same ill-fortune follows after.
582,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"What end of it all, great king? One man, Antenor,"
583,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Escaped the Greeks, came through Illyrian waters"
584,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Safe to Liburnian regions, where Timavus"
585,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Roars underground, comes up nine times, and reaches"
586,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The floodland near the seas. One man, Antenor,"
587,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Founded a city, Padua, a dwelling"
588,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"For Trojan men, a resting-place from labor,"
589,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And shares their quietude. But we, your children,"
590,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"To whom heaven’s height is granted, we are betrayed,"
591,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"We have lost our ships, we are kept from Italy,"
592,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Kept far away. One enemy--I tell you
593,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,This is a shameful thing! Do we deserve it?
594,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Is this our rise to power?”
595,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,
596,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"He smiled, in answer,"
597,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The kind of smile that clears the air, and kissed her."
598,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"“Fear not, my daughter; fate remains unmoved"
599,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,For the Roman generations. You will witness
600,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Lavinium’s rise, her walls fulfill the promise;"
601,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,You will bring to heaven lofty-souled Aeneas.
602,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,There has been no change in me whatever. Listen!
603,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"To ease this care, I will prophesy a little,"
604,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,I will open the book of fate. Your son Aeneas
605,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Will wage a mighty war in Italy,"
606,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Beat down proud nations, give his people laws,"
607,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Found them a city, a matter of three years"
608,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"From victory to settlement. His son,"
609,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The boy Ascanius, named Ilus once,"
610,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"When Troy was standing, and now called Iulus,"
611,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Shall reign for thirty years, and great in power"
612,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Forsake Lavinium, transfer the kingdom"
613,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"To Alba Longa, new-built capital."
614,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Here, for three hundred years, the line of Hector"
615,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Shall govern, till a royal priestess bears"
616,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Twin sons to Mars, and Romulus, rejoicing"
617,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"In the brown wolf-skin of his foster-mother,"
618,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Takes up the tribe, and builds the martial walls"
619,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And calls the people, after himself, the Romans."
620,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,To these I set no bounds in space or time;
621,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,They shall rule forever. Even bitter Juno
622,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Whose fear now harries earth and sea and heaven
623,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Will change to better counsels, and will cherish"
624,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The race that wears the toga, Roman masters"
625,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Of all the world. It is decreed. The time
626,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Will come, as holy years wheel on, when Troy"
627,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Will subjugate Mycenae, vanquish Phthia,"
628,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Be lord of Argos. And from this great line
629,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Will come a Trojan, Caesar, to establish"
630,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The limit of his empire at the ocean,"
631,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"His glory at the stars, a man called Julius"
632,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Whose name recalls Iulus. Welcome waits
633,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,For him in heaven; all the spoils of Asia
634,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Will weigh him down, and prayer be made before him."
635,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Then wars will cease, and a rough age grow gentler,"
636,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"White Faith and Vesta, Romulus and Remus,"
637,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Give law to nations. War’s grim gates will close,"
638,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Tight-shut with bars of iron, and inside them"
639,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The wickedness of war sit bound and silent,"
640,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,The red mouth straining and the hands held tight
641,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"In fastenings of bronze, a hundred hundred.”"
642,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,
643,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"With that, he sent down Mercury from heaven"
644,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"That Carthage might be kindly, and her land"
645,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And new-built towers receive them with a welcome,"
646,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And their queen, Dido, knowing the will of fate,"
647,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Swing wide her doors. On the oarage of his wings
648,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"He flies through the wide sweep of air to Libya,"
649,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Where, at the will of the god, the folk make ready"
650,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"In kindliness of heart, and their queen’s purpose"
651,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Is gracious and gentle.
652,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,
653,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,All night long Aeneas
654,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Had pondered many a care, and with bright morning"
655,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Resolved to reconnoiter; the winds have brought him
656,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"To a new country: who lives in it, men"
657,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Or only beasts? The fields appear untended.
658,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The fleet lies under a hollow cliff, surrounded"
659,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"By spikes of shade, and groves arch overhead,"
660,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Ample concealment. Aeneas and Achates
661,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Went forth together, armed, down the trail in the forest,"
662,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And there his mother met him, a girl, it seemed,"
663,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"From Thrace or Sparta, trim as any huntress"
664,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Who rides her horses hard, or outspeeds rivers"
665,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"In her swift going. A bow hung over her shoulder,"
666,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Her hair blew free, her knees were bare, her garments"
667,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Tucked at the waist and knotted. As she saw them,"
668,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"“Ho there, young men,” she cried, “have you seen my sister"
669,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Around here anywhere? She wears a quiver,"
670,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,And a spotted lynx-hide; maybe you have heard her
671,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Hunting the boar and shouting?”
672,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,
673,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,But her son
674,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Responded: “No; we have heard no sounds of hunting.
675,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"We have seen no one here. But tell me, maiden,"
676,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,What name to call you by? In voice and feature
677,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"You are, I think, no mortal; a goddess, surely,--"
678,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Nymph, or Apollo’s sister? Whoever you are,"
679,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Be kind to us, lighten our trouble, tell us"
680,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Under what sky, along what coast of the world,"
681,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"We wander, knowing neither land nor people,"
682,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Driven by gales and billows. Many a victim
683,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,We shall make ready for your altar.” Venus
684,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Answered: “I have no title to such honor.
685,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,The Tyrian girls all wear these crimson leggings
686,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Lake mine, and carry quivers. Tyrian folk"
687,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Live here; their city is Carthage; over the border
688,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Lies Libya, warlike people. Our queen, Dido,"
689,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Came here from Tyre; she was fleeing from her brother,--"
690,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"A long and complicated story; outrage,--"
691,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"No matter; here it is, in brief. Her husband"
692,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Was Sychaeus, wealthiest of all Phoenicians,"
693,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"At least in land, and Dido loved him dearly"
694,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Since first her father gave her to him, virgin,"
695,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And then unlucky bride. She had a brother,"
696,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Pygmalion, king of Tyre, a monster, evil"
697,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"In wickedness, and madness came between"
698,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Those men, the two of them. Pygmalion murdered"
699,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Sychaeus at the altar; he was crazy
700,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,And blind for gold and crafty; what did he care
701,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,About his sister’s love? And he kept it quiet
702,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"For a long time, kept telling Dido something"
703,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"To fool her with false comfort, but Sychaeus"
704,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Came to her in a dream, a ghost, unburied,"
705,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"With the wounds in his breast, the story of the altar,"
706,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The pale lips blurting out the secret horror,"
707,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The crime in the dark of the household. _Flee_, he told her,"
708,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,_Forsake this land_; and he told her where the treasure
709,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Lay hidden in earth, uncounted gold and silver."
710,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Dido was moved to flight, secured companions,"
711,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"All those possessed by fear, all those whom hatred"
712,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Had made relentless; ships were standing ready,"
713,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"As it so happened; they put the gold aboard,"
714,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,And over the sea the greedy tyrant’s treasure
715,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Went sailing, with a woman for a captain."
716,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,They came here; you will see the walls arising
717,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,And the great citadel of the town called Carthage.
718,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Here they bought ground; they used to call it Byrsa,"
719,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,That being a word for bull’s hide; they bought only
720,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,What a bull’s hide could cover. And now tell me
721,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Who you might be yourselves? what land do you come from,"
722,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Bound for what coast?”
723,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,
724,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,And he began his answer
725,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"With a long sigh: “O goddess, if I told you"
726,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"All from the first beginning, if you had leisure"
727,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"To listen to the record of our trouble,"
728,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"It would take me all day long. From ancient Troy,"
729,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"In case that name means anything, we come"
730,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Driven over many seas, and now a storm"
731,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Has whipped us on this coast. I am Aeneas,"
732,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"A good, devoted man; I carry with me"
733,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"My household gods, saved from the Greeks; I am known"
734,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"In heaven; it is Italy I seek,"
735,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"A homeland for me there, and a race descended"
736,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,From lofty Jove. With a score of ships we started
737,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Over the Phrygian ocean, following fate"
738,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,And the way my mother pointed. Only seven
739,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Are left us now, battered survivors, after"
740,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,The rage of wind and wave. And here I wander
741,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The wastes of Libya, unknown and needy,"
742,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Driven from Europe and Asia.” And his mother
743,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Broke in on his complaining:--“Whoever you are,"
744,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Some god must care for you, I think, to bring you"
745,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Here to the city of Carthage. Follow on,"
746,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Go to the royal palace. For, I tell you,"
747,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Your comrades have returned, your fleet is safe,"
748,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Brought to good haven by the turn of the winds,"
749,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Unless the augury my parents taught me
750,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Was foolish nonsense. In the heaven yonder
751,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"You see twelve swans, rejoicing in long column,"
752,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Scattered, a little while ago, and driven"
753,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"By the swooping eagle, over all the sky,"
754,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"But now, it seems, they light on land, or watch"
755,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Those who came down before them; as they circle
756,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"In company, and make a cheerful sound"
757,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"With whir of wing or song, so, let me tell you,"
758,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Your ships and men already enter harbor
759,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Or near it under full sail. Keep on, go forward"
760,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Where the path leads.”
761,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,
762,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And as she turned, her shoulders"
763,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Shone with a radiant light; her hair shed fragrance,"
764,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Her robes slipped to her feet, and the true goddess"
765,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Walked in divinity. He knew his mother,"
766,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,And his voice pursued her flight: “Cruel again!
767,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Why mock your son so often with false phantoms?
768,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Why may not hand be joined to hand, and words"
769,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Exchanged in truthfulness?” So, still reproachful,"
770,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"He went on toward the city, with Achates,"
771,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"But Venus cast dark air around their going,"
772,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"A veil of mist, so that no man might see them"
773,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Or lay a hand on them, or halt them, asking"
774,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,The reasons of their coming. She soared upward
775,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"To Paphos, happily home to temple and altars"
776,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Steaming with incense, redolent with garlands."
777,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,
778,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And they went on, where the little pathway led them"
779,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"To rising ground; below them lay the city,"
780,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Majestic buildings now, where once were hovels,"
781,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"A wonder to Aeneas, gates and bustle"
782,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And well-paved streets, the busy Tyrians toiling"
783,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"With stones for walls and citadel, or marking"
784,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Foundations for their homes, drainage and furrow,"
785,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"All under ordered process. They dredge harbors,"
786,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Set cornerstones, quarry the rock, where someday"
787,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Their theater will tower. They are like bees
788,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,In early summer over the country flowers
789,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"When the sun is warm, and the young of the hive emerge,"
790,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And they pack the molten honey, bulge the cells"
791,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"With the sweet nectar, add new loads, and harry"
792,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The drones away from the hive, and the work glows,"
793,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,And the air is sweet with bergamot and clover.
794,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,“Happy the men whose walls already rise!”
795,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Exclaims Aeneas, gazing on the city,"
796,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And enters there, still veiled in cloud--a marvel!--"
797,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And walks among the people, and no one sees him."
798,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,
799,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"There was a grove in the middle of the city,"
800,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Most happy in its shade; this was the place
801,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Where first the Tyrians, tossed by storm and whirlwind,"
802,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Dug up the symbol royal Juno showed them,"
803,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The skull of a war-horse, a sign the race to come"
804,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Would be supreme in war and wealth, for ages,"
805,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,And Dido here was building a great temple
806,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"In Juno’s honor, rich in gifts, and blessed"
807,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,With the presence of the goddess. Lintel and rafter
808,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Were bronze above bronze stairways, and bronze portals"
809,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Swung on bronze hinges. Here Aeneas first
810,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Dared hope for safety, find some reassurance"
811,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"In hope of better days: a strange sight met him,"
812,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"To take his fear away. Waiting the queen,"
813,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"He stood there watching, under the great temple,"
814,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Letting his eyes survey the city’s fortune,"
815,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The artist’s workmanship, the craftsman’s labor,"
816,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And there, with more than wonder, he sees the battles"
817,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Fought around Troy, and the wars whose fame had travelled"
818,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The whole world over; there is Agamemnon,"
819,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Priam, and Menelaus, and Achilles,"
820,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,A menace to them all. He is moved to tears.
821,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"“What place in all the world,” he asks Achates,"
822,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,“Is empty of our sorrow? There is Priam!
823,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Look! even here there are rewards for praise,"
824,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"There are tears for things, and what men suffer touches"
825,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,The human heart. Dismiss your fear; this story
826,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Will bring some safety to you.” Sighing often,"
827,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,He could not turn his gaze away; it was only
828,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"A picture on a wall, but the sight afforded"
829,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Food for the spirit’s need. He saw the Greeks,"
830,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Hard-pressed, in flight, and Trojans coming after,"
831,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Or, on another panel, the scene reversed,"
832,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Achilles in pursuit, his own men fleeing;"
833,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"He saw, and tears came into his eyes again,"
834,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The tents of Rhesus, snowy-white, betrayed"
835,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,In their first sleep by bloody Diomedes
836,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"With many a death, and the fiery horses driven"
837,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Into the camp, before they ever tasted"
838,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The grass of Troy, or drank from Xanthus’ river."
839,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Another scene showed Troilus, poor youngster,"
840,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Running away, his arms flung down; Achilles"
841,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Was much too good for him; he had fallen backward
842,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Out of his car, but held the reins, and the horses"
843,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Dragged him along the ground, his hair and shoulders"
844,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Bounding in dust, and the spear making a scribble."
845,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And there were Trojan women, all in mourning,"
846,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"With streaming hair, on their way to Pallas’ temple,"
847,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Bearing, as gift, a robe, but the stern goddess"
848,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Kept her gaze on the ground. Three times Achilles
849,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Had dragged the body of Hector around the walls,"
850,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,And was selling it for money. What a groan
851,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Came from Aeneas’ heart, seeing that spoil,"
852,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"That chariot, and helpless Priam reaching"
853,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"His hands, unarmed, across the broken body!"
854,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And he saw himself there, too, fighting in battle"
855,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Against Greek leaders, he saw the Eastern columns,"
856,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And swarthy Memnon’s arms. Penthesilea,"
857,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The Amazon, blazes in fury, leading"
858,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Her crescent-shielded thousands, a golden buckle"
859,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Below her naked breast, a soldieress"
860,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Fighting with men.
861,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,
862,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,And as he watched these marvels
863,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"In one long fascinated stare of wonder,"
864,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Dido, the queen, drew near; she came to the temple"
865,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"With a great train, all majesty, all beauty,"
866,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"As on Eurotas’ riverside, or where"
867,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Mount Cynthus towers high, Diana leads"
868,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Her bands of dancers, and the Oreads follow"
869,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"In thousands, right and left, the taller goddess,"
870,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The quiver-bearing maiden, and Latona"
871,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Is filled with secret happiness, so Dido"
872,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Moved in her company, a queen, rejoicing,"
873,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Ordering on her kingdom’s rising glory.
874,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"At Juno’s portal, under the arch of the temple,"
875,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"She took her throne, a giver of law and justice,"
876,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"A fair partitioner of toil and duty,"
877,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And suddenly Aeneas, from the crowd,"
878,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Saw Trojan men approaching, brave Cloanthus,"
879,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Sergestus, Antheus, and all those others"
880,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Whom the black storm had driven here and yonder.
881,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"This he cannot believe, nor can Achates,"
882,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Torn between fear and joy. They burn with ardor
883,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"To seek their comrades’ handclasp, but confusion"
884,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Still holds them in the cloud: what can have happened?
885,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,They watch from the cover of mist: men still were coming
886,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"From all the ships, chosen, it seemed, as pleaders"
887,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"For graciousness before the temple, calling"
888,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Aloud: what fortune had been theirs, he wonders,"
889,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Where had they left the ships; why were they coming?
890,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"They were given audience; Ilioneus,"
891,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Senior to all, began: “O Queen, whom Jove"
892,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Has given the founding of a great new city,"
893,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Has given to bridle haughty tribes with justice,"
894,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"We, pitiful Trojans, over every ocean"
895,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Driven by storm, make our appeal: keep from us"
896,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,The terrible doom of fire; protect our vessels;
897,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Have mercy on a decent race; consider
898,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Our lot with closer interest. We have not come
899,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"To ravish Libyan homes, or carry plunder"
900,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Down to the shore. We lack the arrogance
901,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Of conquerors; there is no aggression in us.
902,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"There is a place which Greeks have given a name,"
903,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The Land in the West; it is powerful in arms,"
904,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Rich in its soil; Oenotrians used to live there,"
905,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And now, the story goes, a younger people"
906,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Inhabit it, calling themselves Italians"
907,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,After their leader’s name. We were going there
908,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"When, big with storm and cloud, Orion rising"
909,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Drove us on hidden quicksands, and wild winds"
910,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Scattered us over the waves, by pathless rocks"
911,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,And the swell of the surge. A few of us have drifted
912,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Here to your shores. What kind of men are these,"
913,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,What barbarous land permits such attitudes?
914,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"We have been denied the welcome of the beach,"
915,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Forbidden to set foot on land; they rouse
916,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"All kinds of war against us. You despise,"
917,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"It may be, human brotherhood, and arms"
918,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Wielded by men. But there are gods, remember,"
919,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Who care for right and wrong. Our king Aeneas
920,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"May be alive; no man was ever more just,"
921,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"More decent ever, or greater in war and arms."
922,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"If fate preserves him still, if he still breathes"
923,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The welcome air, above the world of shadows,"
924,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Fear not; to have treated us with kindly service
925,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Need bring you no repentance. We have cities
926,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"In Sicily as well, and King Acestes"
927,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Is one of us, from Trojan blood. We ask you"
928,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"To let us beach our battered fleet, make ready"
929,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Beams from the forest timber, mend our oarage,"
930,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Seek Italy and Latium, glad at knowing"
931,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Our king and comrades rescued. But if safety
932,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Is hopeless for him now, and Libyan water"
933,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Has been his grave, and if his son Iulus"
934,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Is desperate, or lost, grant us permission"
935,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"At least to make for Sicily, whence we came here,"
936,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Where king Acestes has a dwelling for us.”
937,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The Trojans, as he ended, all were shouting,"
938,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And Dido, looking down, made a brief answer:"
939,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"“I am sorry, Trojans; put aside your care,"
940,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Have no more fear. The newness of the kingdom
941,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,And our strict need compel to me such measures--
942,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Sentries on every border, far and wide."
943,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,But who so ignorant as not to know
944,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The nation of Aeneas, manly both"
945,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"In deeds and people, and the city of Troy?"
946,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"We are not as dull as that, we folk from Carthage;"
947,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,The sun shines on us here. Whether you seek
948,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The land in the west, the sometime fields of Saturn,"
949,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Or the Sicilian realms and king Acestes,"
950,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,I will help you to the limit; should you wish
951,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"To settle here and share this kingdom with me,"
952,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,The city I found is yours; draw up your ships;
953,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Trojan and Tyrian I treat alike.
954,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Would, also, that your king were here, Aeneas,"
955,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Driven by that same wind. I will send good men
956,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Along the coast to seek him, under orders"
957,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,To scour all Libya; he may be wandering
958,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Somewhere, in woods or town, surviving shipwreck.”"
959,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,
960,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Aeneas and Achates both were eager
961,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,To break the cloud; the queen inspired their spirit
962,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,With her address. Achates asked Aeneas:--
963,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"“What do we do now, goddess-born? You see"
964,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"They all are safe, our vessels and our comrades,"
965,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Only one missing, and we saw him drowning,"
966,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Ourselves, beneath the waves; all other things"
967,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Confirm what Venus told us.” And as he finished,"
968,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The cloud around them broke, dissolved in air,"
969,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Illumining Aeneas, like a god,"
970,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Light radiant around his face and shoulders,"
971,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,And Venus gave him all the bloom of youth.
972,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Its glow, its liveliness, as the artist adds"
973,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Luster to ivory, or sets in gold"
974,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Silver or marble. No one saw him coming
975,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Until he spoke:--“You seek me; here I am,"
976,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Trojan Aeneas, saved from the Libyan waves."
977,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Worn out by all the perils of land and sea,"
978,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"In need of everything, blown over the great world,"
979,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"A remnant left by the Greeks, Dido, we lack"
980,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,The means to thank our only pitier
981,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,For offer of a city and a home.
982,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"If there is justice anywhere, if goodness"
983,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Means anything to any power, if gods"
984,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"At all regard good people, may they give"
985,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The great rewards you merit. Happy the age,"
986,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Happy the parents who have brought you forth!
987,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"While rivers run to sea, while shadows move"
988,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Over the mountains, while the stars burn on,"
989,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Always, your praise, your honor, and your name,"
990,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Whatever land I go to, will endure.”"
991,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"His hand went out to greet his men, Serestus,"
992,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Gyas, Cloanthus, Ilioneus,"
993,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,The others in their turn. And Dido marvelled
994,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"At his appearance, first, and all that trouble"
995,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,He had borne up under; there was a moment’s silence
996,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Before she spoke: “What chance, what violence,"
997,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"O goddess-born, has driven you through danger,"
998,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,From grief to grief? Are you indeed that son
999,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Whom Venus bore Anchises? I remember
1000,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"When Teucer came to Sidon, as an exile"
1001,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Seeking new kingdoms, and my father helped him,"
1002,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"My father, Belus, conqueror of Cyprus."
1003,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"From that time on I have known about your city,"
1004,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Your name, and the Greek kings, and the fall of Troy."
1005,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Even their enemies would praise the Trojans,"
1006,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Or claim descent from Teucer’s line. I bid you
1007,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Enter my house. I, too, am fortune-driven"
1008,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Through many sufferings; this land at last
1009,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Has brought me rest. Not ignorant of evil,"
1010,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"I know one thing, at least,--to help the wretched.”"
1011,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And so she led Aeneas to the palace,"
1012,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Proclaiming sacrifice at all the temples
1013,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"In honor of his welcome, and sent presents"
1014,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"To his comrades at the shore, a score of bullocks,"
1015,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"A hundred swine, a hundred ewes and lambs"
1016,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"In honor of the joyous day. The palace,"
1017,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Within, is made most bright with pomp and splendor,"
1018,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,The halls prepared for feasting. Crimson covers
1019,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Are laid, with fine embroidery, and silver"
1020,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Is heavy on the tables; gold, engraven,"
1021,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Recalls ancestral prowess, a tale of heroes"
1022,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,From the race’s first beginnings.
1023,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,
1024,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And Aeneas,"
1025,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Being a thoughtful father, speeds Achates"
1026,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Back to the ships, with tidings for Iulus,"
1027,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,He is to join them; all the father’s fondness
1028,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Is centred on the son. Orders are given
1029,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"To bring gifts with him, saved from the Trojan ruins,"
1030,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,A mantle stiff with figures worked in gold;
1031,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"A veil with gold acanthus running through it,"
1032,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Once worn by Helen, when she sailed from Sparta"
1033,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Toward that forbidden marriage, a wondrous gift"
1034,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Made by her mother Leda; and the sceptre
1035,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"That Ilione, Priam’s eldest daughter,"
1036,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Had carried once; a necklace hung with pearls;
1037,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,A crown of gold and jewels. Toward the ships
1038,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Achates sped the message.
1039,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,
1040,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Meanwhile Venus
1041,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Plotted new stratagems, that Cupid, changed"
1042,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"In form and feature, should appear instead"
1043,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Of young Ascanius, and by his gifts"
1044,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Inspire the queen to passion, with his fire"
1045,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Burning her very bones. She feared the house
1046,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Held dubious intentions; men of Tyre
1047,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Were always two-faced people, and Juno’s anger"
1048,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Vexed her by night. She spoke to her wingèd son:--
1049,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"“O my one strength and source of power, my son,"
1050,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Disdainful of Jove’s thunderbolt, to you"
1051,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,I come in prayer for help. You know that Juno
1052,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Is hateful toward Aeneas, keeps him tossing"
1053,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,All over the seas in bitterness; you have often
1054,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Grieved with me for your brother. And now Dido
1055,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Holds him with flattering words; I do not trust
1056,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Juno’s ideas of welcome; she will never
1057,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Pause at a point like this. Therefore I purpose
1058,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"To take the queen by cunning, put around her"
1059,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"A wall of flame, so that no power can change her,"
1060,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,So that a blazing passion for Aeneas
1061,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Will bind her to us. Listen! I will tell you
1062,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"How you can manage this. The royal boy,"
1063,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"My greatest care, has heard his father’s summons"
1064,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"To come to the city, bringing presents, rescued"
1065,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,From the flames of Troy and the sea; and he is ready.
1066,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"But I will make him drowsy, carry him off"
1067,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"In slumber over Cythera, or hide him"
1068,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Deep on Idalium in a secret bower
1069,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Before he learns the scheme or interrupts it.
1070,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"You, for one night, no more, assume his features,"
1071,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The boy’s familiar guise, yourself a boy,"
1072,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,So that when Dido takes you to her bosom
1073,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"During the royal feast, with the wine flowing,"
1074,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And happiness abounding, you, receiving"
1075,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The sweetness of her kiss, will overcome her"
1076,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,With secret fire and poison.”
1077,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,
1078,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,For his mother
1079,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Cupid put off his wings, and went rejoicing"
1080,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,With young Iulus’ stride; the real Iulus
1081,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Venus had lulled in soft repose, and borne him"
1082,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Warm in her bosom to Idalian groves,"
1083,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Where the soft marjoram cradled him with blossom
1084,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Exhaling shadowy sweetness over his slumber.
1085,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And, with Achates leading, Cupid came"
1086,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Obedient to his mother, bringing gifts."
1087,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The queen receives them, on a golden couch"
1088,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Below the royal tapestries, where spreads"
1089,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Of crimson wait Aeneas and his Trojans.
1090,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Servants bring water for their hands, and bread"
1091,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"In baskets, and fine napkins. At the fire"
1092,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Are fifty serving-maids, to set the feast,"
1093,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"A hundred more, girls, and a hundred boys"
1094,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"To load the tables, and bring the goblets round,"
1095,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"As through the happy halls the Tyrians throng,"
1096,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Admire the Trojan gifts, admire Iulus,"
1097,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The young god with the glowing countenance,"
1098,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The charming words, the robe, the saffron veil"
1099,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Edged with acanthus. More than all the rest,"
1100,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Disaster-bound, the unhappy queen takes fire,"
1101,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And cannot have enough of looking, moved"
1102,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Alike by boy and gifts. She watches him
1103,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Cling to his father’s neck, or come to her"
1104,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"For fondling, and her eyes, her heart, receive him,"
1105,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Alas, poor queen, not knowing what a god"
1106,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Is plotting for her sorrow. He remembers
1107,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,What Venus told him; she forgets a little
1108,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,About Sychaeus; the heart unused to love
1109,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Stirs with a living passion.
1110,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"When the first quiet settled over the tables,"
1111,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"And the boards were cleared, they set the great bowls down,"
1112,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Crowning the wine with garlands. A great hum
1113,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Runs through the halls, the voices reach the rafters,"
1114,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The burning lamps below the fretted gold,"
1115,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The torches flaring, put the night to rout."
1116,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The queen commands the loving-cup of Belus,"
1117,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Heavy with gems and gold, and fills it full,"
1118,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,And silence fills the halls before her prayer:--
1119,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"“Jupiter, giver of laws for host and guest,"
1120,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Grant this to be a happy day for all,"
1121,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Both Tyrians and travellers from Troy,"
1122,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,And something for our children to remember!
1123,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"May Bacchus, giver of joy, attend, and Juno"
1124,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Be kind, and all my Tyrians be friendly!”"
1125,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"She poured libation on the table, touched"
1126,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The gold rim with her lips, passed on the bowl"
1127,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"To Bitias, who dove deep, and other lords"
1128,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Took up the challenge. And a minstrel played
1129,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"A golden lyre, Iopas, taught by Atlas:"
1130,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Of the sun’s labors and the wandering moon
1131,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"He sang, whence came the race of beasts and man,"
1132,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Whence rain and fire, the stars and constellations,"
1133,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Why suns in winter hasten to the sea,"
1134,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,Or what delay draws out the dawdling nights.
1135,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The Tyrians roar, applauding, and the Trojans"
1136,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Rejoice no less, and the poor queen prolongs"
1137,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The night with conversation, drinking deep"
1138,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Of her long love, and asking many questions"
1139,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"Of Priam, Hector; of the arms of Memnon;"
1140,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"How big Achilles was; and Diomedes,"
1141,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"What were his horses like? “Tell us, my guest,”"
1142,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"She pleads, “from the beginning, all the story,"
1143,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,"The treachery of the Greeks, the wanderings,"
1144,THE LANDING NEAR CARTHAGE,The perils of the seven tiresome years.”

1151,THE FALL OF TROY,THE FALL OF TROY
1152,THE FALL OF TROY,
1153,THE FALL OF TROY,
1154,THE FALL OF TROY,"They all were silent, watching. From his couch"
1155,THE FALL OF TROY,"Aeneas spoke: “A terrible grief, O Queen,"
1156,THE FALL OF TROY,"You bid me live again, how Troy went down"
1157,THE FALL OF TROY,"Before the Greeks, her wealth, her pitiful kingdom,"
1158,THE FALL OF TROY,"Sorrowful things I saw myself, wherein"
1159,THE FALL OF TROY,"I had my share and more. Even Ulysses,"
1160,THE FALL OF TROY,Even his toughest soldiery might grieve
1161,THE FALL OF TROY,At such a story. And the hour is late
1162,THE FALL OF TROY,Already; night is sliding down the sky
1163,THE FALL OF TROY,And setting stars urge slumber. But if you long
1164,THE FALL OF TROY,"To learn our downfall, to hear the final chapter"
1165,THE FALL OF TROY,"Of Troy, no matter how I shrink, remembering,"
1166,THE FALL OF TROY,"And turn away in grief, let me begin it."
1167,THE FALL OF TROY,
1168,THE FALL OF TROY,"Broken in war, set back by fate, the leaders"
1169,THE FALL OF TROY,"Of the Greek host, as years went by, contrived,"
1170,THE FALL OF TROY,"With Pallas’ help, a horse as big as a mountain."
1171,THE FALL OF TROY,"They wove its sides with planks of fir, pretending"
1172,THE FALL OF TROY,"This was an offering for their safe return,"
1173,THE FALL OF TROY,"At least, so rumor had it. But inside"
1174,THE FALL OF TROY,"They packed, in secret, into the hollow sides"
1175,THE FALL OF TROY,"The fittest warriors; the belly’s cavern,"
1176,THE FALL OF TROY,"Huge as it was, was filled with men in armor."
1177,THE FALL OF TROY,"There is an island, Tenedos, well-known,"
1178,THE FALL OF TROY,Rich in the days of Priam; now it is only
1179,THE FALL OF TROY,"A bay, and not too good an anchorage"
1180,THE FALL OF TROY,"For any ship to trust. They sailed there, hid"
1181,THE FALL OF TROY,"On the deserted shore. We thought they had gone,"
1182,THE FALL OF TROY,"Bound for Mycenae, and Troy was very happy,"
1183,THE FALL OF TROY,"Shaking off grief, throwing the gates wide open."
1184,THE FALL OF TROY,"It was a pleasure, for a change, to go"
1185,THE FALL OF TROY,"See the Greek camp, station and shore abandoned;"
1186,THE FALL OF TROY,"Why, this was where Achilles camped, his minions,"
1187,THE FALL OF TROY,"The Dolopes, were here; and the fleet just yonder,"
1188,THE FALL OF TROY,And that was the plain where we used to meet in battle.
1189,THE FALL OF TROY,"Some of us stared in wonder at the horse,"
1190,THE FALL OF TROY,"Astounded by its vastness, Minerva’s gift,"
1191,THE FALL OF TROY,"Death from the virgin goddess, had we known it."
1192,THE FALL OF TROY,"Thymoetes, whether in treachery, or because"
1193,THE FALL OF TROY,"The fates of Troy so ordered, was the first one"
1194,THE FALL OF TROY,"To urge us bring it in to the heart of the city,"
1195,THE FALL OF TROY,"But Capys, and some others, knowing better,"
1196,THE FALL OF TROY,"Suspicious of Greek plotting, said to throw it"
1197,THE FALL OF TROY,"Into the sea, to burn it up with fire,"
1198,THE FALL OF TROY,"To cut it open, see what there was inside it."
1199,THE FALL OF TROY,The wavering crowd could not make up its mind.
1200,THE FALL OF TROY,
1201,THE FALL OF TROY,"And, at that point, Laocoön came running,"
1202,THE FALL OF TROY,"With a great throng at his heels, down from the hilltop"
1203,THE FALL OF TROY,"As fast as ever he could, and before he reached us,"
1204,THE FALL OF TROY,"Cried in alarm: ‘Are you crazy, wretched people?"
1205,THE FALL OF TROY,"Do you think they have gone, the foe? Do you think that any"
1206,THE FALL OF TROY,"Gifts of the Greeks lack treachery? Ulysses,--"
1207,THE FALL OF TROY,"What was his reputation? Let me tell you,"
1208,THE FALL OF TROY,"Either the Greeks are hiding in this monster,"
1209,THE FALL OF TROY,"Or it’s some trick of war, a spy, or engine,"
1210,THE FALL OF TROY,To come down on the city. Tricky business
1211,THE FALL OF TROY,"Is hiding in it. Do not trust it, Trojans,"
1212,THE FALL OF TROY,"Do not believe this horse. Whatever it may be,"
1213,THE FALL OF TROY,"I fear the Greeks, even when bringing presents.’"
1214,THE FALL OF TROY,"With that, he hurled the great spear at the side"
1215,THE FALL OF TROY,"With all the strength he had. It fastened, trembling,"
1216,THE FALL OF TROY,"And the struck womb rang hollow, a moaning sound."
1217,THE FALL OF TROY,"He had driven us, almost, to let the light in"
1218,THE FALL OF TROY,"With the point of the steel, to probe, to tear, but something"
1219,THE FALL OF TROY,"Got in his way, the gods, or fate, or counsel,"
1220,THE FALL OF TROY,"Ill-omened, in our hearts; or Troy would be standing"
1221,THE FALL OF TROY,And Priam’s lofty citadel unshaken.
1222,THE FALL OF TROY,
1223,THE FALL OF TROY,"Meanwhile, some Trojan shepherds, pulling and hauling,"
1224,THE FALL OF TROY,"Had a young fellow, with his hands behind him,"
1225,THE FALL OF TROY,"Tied up, and they were dragging him to Priam."
1226,THE FALL OF TROY,"He had let himself be taken so, on purpose,"
1227,THE FALL OF TROY,"To open Troy to the Greeks, a stranger, ready"
1228,THE FALL OF TROY,"For death or shifty cunning, a cool intriguer,"
1229,THE FALL OF TROY,"Let come what may. They crowd around to see him,"
1230,THE FALL OF TROY,"Take turns in making fun of him, that captive."
1231,THE FALL OF TROY,"Listen, and learn Greek trickiness; learn all"
1232,THE FALL OF TROY,Their crimes from one.
1233,THE FALL OF TROY,"He stopped in the middle, frightened and defenceless,"
1234,THE FALL OF TROY,"Looked at the Trojan ranks,--‘What land, what waters,"
1235,THE FALL OF TROY,"Can take me now?’ he cried, ‘There is nothing, nothing"
1236,THE FALL OF TROY,"Left for me any more, no place with the Greeks,"
1237,THE FALL OF TROY,And here are the Trojans howling for my blood!’
1238,THE FALL OF TROY,"Our mood was changed. We pitied him, poor fellow,"
1239,THE FALL OF TROY,"Sobbing his heart out. We bade him tell his story,"
1240,THE FALL OF TROY,"His lineage, his news: what can he count on,"
1241,THE FALL OF TROY,The captive that he is? His fear had gone
1242,THE FALL OF TROY,"As he began: ‘O King, whatever happens,"
1243,THE FALL OF TROY,"I will tell the truth, tell all of it; to start with,"
1244,THE FALL OF TROY,"I own I am a Greek. Sinon is wretched,"
1245,THE FALL OF TROY,"Fortune has made him so, but she will never"
1246,THE FALL OF TROY,Make him a liar. You may perhaps have heard
1247,THE FALL OF TROY,"Rumors of Palamedes, son of Belus,"
1248,THE FALL OF TROY,"A man of glorious fame. But the Greeks killed him,--"
1249,THE FALL OF TROY,"He was against the war, and so they killed him,"
1250,THE FALL OF TROY,"An innocent man, by perjury and lying"
1251,THE FALL OF TROY,False witness. Now that he is dead they mourn him.
1252,THE FALL OF TROY,"My father, his poor relative, had sent me"
1253,THE FALL OF TROY,To soldier in his company; I was then
1254,THE FALL OF TROY,Scarcely beyond my boyhood. Palamedes
1255,THE FALL OF TROY,"Held, for some time, some influence and standing"
1256,THE FALL OF TROY,"In royal councils, and we shared his glory,"
1257,THE FALL OF TROY,"But, and all men know this, Ulysses’ hatred,"
1258,THE FALL OF TROY,"His cunning malice, pulled him down; thereafter"
1259,THE FALL OF TROY,"I lived in darkness, dragging out a lifetime"
1260,THE FALL OF TROY,"In sorrow for my innocent lord, and anger,"
1261,THE FALL OF TROY,"And in my anger I was very foolish,"
1262,THE FALL OF TROY,"I talked; I vowed, if I got home to Argos,"
1263,THE FALL OF TROY,I would have vengeance: so I roused Ulysses
1264,THE FALL OF TROY,"To hate me in his turn, and that began it,"
1265,THE FALL OF TROY,"Downfall and evil, Ulysses always trying"
1266,THE FALL OF TROY,"To frighten me with hint and accusation,"
1267,THE FALL OF TROY,With rumors planted where the crowd would listen;
1268,THE FALL OF TROY,"Oh yes, Ulysses knew what he was doing,"
1269,THE FALL OF TROY,"He never stopped, until with Calchas working"
1270,THE FALL OF TROY,"Hand in glove with him--why am I telling this,"
1271,THE FALL OF TROY,"And what’s the use? I am stalling. All the Greeks,"
1272,THE FALL OF TROY,"You think, are all alike; what more do you want?"
1273,THE FALL OF TROY,Inflict the punishment. That would be something
1274,THE FALL OF TROY,"Ulysses would rejoice in, and some others"
1275,THE FALL OF TROY,Pay handsome money for!’
1276,THE FALL OF TROY,
1277,THE FALL OF TROY,But we were all on fire to hear him further.
1278,THE FALL OF TROY,Pelasgian craft meant nothing to our folly.
1279,THE FALL OF TROY,"Trembling and nervous, he resumed his lying:"
1280,THE FALL OF TROY,‘The Greeks were tired of the long war; they often
1281,THE FALL OF TROY,"Wanted to sail from Troy for home. Oh, would"
1282,THE FALL OF TROY,That they had only done it! But a storm
1283,THE FALL OF TROY,"Would cut them off, or the wrong wind terrify them."
1284,THE FALL OF TROY,"Especially, just after the horse was finished,"
1285,THE FALL OF TROY,"With the joined planks of maple, all the heaven"
1286,THE FALL OF TROY,Roared loud with storm-clouds. In suspense and terror
1287,THE FALL OF TROY,We sent Eurypylus to ask Apollo
1288,THE FALL OF TROY,"What could be done; the oracle was gloomy,"
1289,THE FALL OF TROY,"Foreboding: “Blood, O Greeks, and a slain virgin"
1290,THE FALL OF TROY,Appeased the winds when first you came here; blood
1291,THE FALL OF TROY,"Must pay for your return, a life be given,"
1292,THE FALL OF TROY,An Argive life.” The word came to our ears
1293,THE FALL OF TROY,"With terror in it, our blood ran cold in our veins,"
1294,THE FALL OF TROY,For whom was fate preparing? who would be
1295,THE FALL OF TROY,The victim of Apollo? Then Ulysses
1296,THE FALL OF TROY,"Dragged Calchas into our midst, with a great uproar,"
1297,THE FALL OF TROY,Trying his best to make the prophet tell us
1298,THE FALL OF TROY,What the gods wanted. And there were many then
1299,THE FALL OF TROY,"Who told me what was coming, or kept silent"
1300,THE FALL OF TROY,"Because they saw, and all too well, the scheme"
1301,THE FALL OF TROY,Ulysses had in mind. For ten days Calchas
1302,THE FALL OF TROY,"Said nothing at all, hid in his tent, refusing"
1303,THE FALL OF TROY,"To have a word of his pronounce the sentence,"
1304,THE FALL OF TROY,"And all the time Ulysses kept on shouting,"
1305,THE FALL OF TROY,"Till Calchas broke, and doomed me to the altar."
1306,THE FALL OF TROY,And all assented; what each man had feared
1307,THE FALL OF TROY,"In his own case, he bore with great composure"
1308,THE FALL OF TROY,When turned another way.
1309,THE FALL OF TROY,The terrible day was almost on me; fillets
1310,THE FALL OF TROY,"Were ready for my temples, the salted meal"
1311,THE FALL OF TROY,"Prepared, the altars standing. But I fled,"
1312,THE FALL OF TROY,"I tore myself away from death, I admit it,"
1313,THE FALL OF TROY,I hid all night in sedge and muddy water
1314,THE FALL OF TROY,"At the edge of the lake, hoping, forever hoping,"
1315,THE FALL OF TROY,They might set sail. And now I hope no longer
1316,THE FALL OF TROY,"To see my home, my parents, or my children,"
1317,THE FALL OF TROY,"Poor things, whom they will kill because I fled them,"
1318,THE FALL OF TROY,Whom they will murder for my sacrilege.
1319,THE FALL OF TROY,"But oh, by the gods above, by any power"
1320,THE FALL OF TROY,"That values truth, by any uncorrupted"
1321,THE FALL OF TROY,"Remnant of faith in all the world, have pity,"
1322,THE FALL OF TROY,"Have pity on a soul that bears such sorrow,"
1323,THE FALL OF TROY,More than I ever deserved.’
1324,THE FALL OF TROY,"He had no need to ask us. Priam said,"
1325,THE FALL OF TROY,"_Untie him_, and we did so with a promise"
1326,THE FALL OF TROY,"To spare his life. Our king, with friendly words,"
1327,THE FALL OF TROY,"Addressed him, saying, ‘Whoever you are, forget"
1328,THE FALL OF TROY,"The Greeks, from now on. You are ours; but tell me"
1329,THE FALL OF TROY,"Why they have built this monstrous horse? who made it,"
1330,THE FALL OF TROY,"Who thought of it? What is it, war-machine,"
1331,THE FALL OF TROY,"Religious offering?’ And he, instructed"
1332,THE FALL OF TROY,"In every trick and artifice, made answer,"
1333,THE FALL OF TROY,"Lifting his hands, now free: ‘Eternal fires,"
1334,THE FALL OF TROY,"Inviolable godhead, be my witness,"
1335,THE FALL OF TROY,"You altars, you accursèd swords, you fillets"
1336,THE FALL OF TROY,"Which I as victim wore, I had the right"
1337,THE FALL OF TROY,"To break those solemn bonds, I had the right"
1338,THE FALL OF TROY,"To hate those men, to bring whatever they hide"
1339,THE FALL OF TROY,Into the light and air; I am bound no longer
1340,THE FALL OF TROY,"To any country, any laws, but, Trojans,"
1341,THE FALL OF TROY,"Keep to the promise, if I tell the truth,"
1342,THE FALL OF TROY,If I pay back with interest.
1343,THE FALL OF TROY,"All the Greek hope, since first the war began,"
1344,THE FALL OF TROY,"Rested in Pallas, always. But Ulysses,"
1345,THE FALL OF TROY,"The crime-contriver, and the son of Tydeus"
1346,THE FALL OF TROY,"Attacked Minerva’s temple, stole her image"
1347,THE FALL OF TROY,"Out of the holy shrine, and slew the guards,"
1348,THE FALL OF TROY,"And laid their bloody hands upon the goddess,"
1349,THE FALL OF TROY,"And from that time the Danaan hopes were broken,"
1350,THE FALL OF TROY,Faltered and failed. It was no doubtful anger
1351,THE FALL OF TROY,Pallas revealed; she gave them signs and portents.
1352,THE FALL OF TROY,From her image in the camp the upraised eyes
1353,THE FALL OF TROY,"Shot fire, and sweat ran salty down the limbs,"
1354,THE FALL OF TROY,Thrice from the ground she seemed to flash and leap
1355,THE FALL OF TROY,"With vibrant spear and clashing shield. The priest,"
1356,THE FALL OF TROY,"Calchas, made prophecy: they must take to flight"
1357,THE FALL OF TROY,"Over the sea, and Troy could not be taken"
1358,THE FALL OF TROY,"Without new omens; they must go to Argos,"
1359,THE FALL OF TROY,"Bring back the goddess again, whom they have taken"
1360,THE FALL OF TROY,"In curved ships over the sea. And if they have gone,"
1361,THE FALL OF TROY,"They are bound for home, Mycenae, for new arms,"
1362,THE FALL OF TROY,"New gods, new soldiers; they will be here again"
1363,THE FALL OF TROY,"When least expected. Calchas’ message warned them,"
1364,THE FALL OF TROY,"And so they built this image, to replace"
1365,THE FALL OF TROY,"The one they had stolen, a gigantic offering"
1366,THE FALL OF TROY,"For a tremendous sacrilege. It was Calchas,"
1367,THE FALL OF TROY,"Again, who bade them build a mass so mighty"
1368,THE FALL OF TROY,"It almost reached the stars, too big to enter"
1369,THE FALL OF TROY,"Through any gate, or be brought inside the walls."
1370,THE FALL OF TROY,"For if your hands should damage it, destruction,"
1371,THE FALL OF TROY,"(May God avert it) would come upon the city,"
1372,THE FALL OF TROY,"But if your hands helped bring it home, then Asia"
1373,THE FALL OF TROY,"Would be invading Greece, and doom await"
1374,THE FALL OF TROY,Our children’s children.’
1375,THE FALL OF TROY,
1376,THE FALL OF TROY,"We believed him, we"
1377,THE FALL OF TROY,Whom neither Diomede nor great Achilles
1378,THE FALL OF TROY,"Had taken, nor ten years, nor that armada,"
1379,THE FALL OF TROY,A thousand ships of war. But Sinon did it
1380,THE FALL OF TROY,By perjury and guile.
1381,THE FALL OF TROY,
1382,THE FALL OF TROY,"Then something else,"
1383,THE FALL OF TROY,"Much greater and more terrible, was forced"
1384,THE FALL OF TROY,"Upon us, troubling our unseeing spirits."
1385,THE FALL OF TROY,"Laocoön, allotted priest of Neptune,"
1386,THE FALL OF TROY,"Was slaying a great bull beside the altars,"
1387,THE FALL OF TROY,"When suddenly, over the tranquil deep"
1388,THE FALL OF TROY,"From Tenedos,--I shudder even now,"
1389,THE FALL OF TROY,Recalling it--there came a pair of serpents
1390,THE FALL OF TROY,"With monstrous coils, breasting the sea, and aiming"
1391,THE FALL OF TROY,Together for the shore. Their heads and shoulders
1392,THE FALL OF TROY,"Rose over the waves, upright, with bloody crests,"
1393,THE FALL OF TROY,"The rest of them trailing along the water,"
1394,THE FALL OF TROY,Looping in giant spirals; the foaming sea
1395,THE FALL OF TROY,"Hissed under their motion. And they reached the land,"
1396,THE FALL OF TROY,"Their burning eyes suffused with blood and fire,"
1397,THE FALL OF TROY,Their darting tongues licking the hissing mouths.
1398,THE FALL OF TROY,"Pale at the sight, we fled. But they went on"
1399,THE FALL OF TROY,"Straight toward Laocoön, and first each serpent"
1400,THE FALL OF TROY,"Seized in its coils his two young sons, and fastened"
1401,THE FALL OF TROY,The fangs in those poor bodies. And the priest
1402,THE FALL OF TROY,"Struggled to help them, weapons in his hand."
1403,THE FALL OF TROY,"They seized him, bound him with their mighty coils,"
1404,THE FALL OF TROY,"Twice round his waist, twice round his neck, they squeezed"
1405,THE FALL OF TROY,"With scaly pressure, and still towered above him."
1406,THE FALL OF TROY,"Straining his hands to tear the knots apart,"
1407,THE FALL OF TROY,"His chaplets stained with blood and the black poison,"
1408,THE FALL OF TROY,"He uttered horrible cries, not even human,"
1409,THE FALL OF TROY,"More like the bellowing of a bull, when, wounded"
1410,THE FALL OF TROY,"It flees the altar, shaking from the shoulder"
1411,THE FALL OF TROY,The ill-aimed axe. And on the pair went gliding
1412,THE FALL OF TROY,"To the highest shrine, the citadel of Pallas,"
1413,THE FALL OF TROY,And vanished underneath the feet of the goddess
1414,THE FALL OF TROY,And the circle of her shield.
1415,THE FALL OF TROY,
1416,THE FALL OF TROY,The people trembled
1417,THE FALL OF TROY,"Again; they said Laocoön deserved it,"
1418,THE FALL OF TROY,"Having, with spear, profaned the sacred image."
1419,THE FALL OF TROY,"It must be brought to its place, they cried, the goddess"
1420,THE FALL OF TROY,"Must be appeased. We broke the walls, exposing"
1421,THE FALL OF TROY,"The city’s battlements, and all were busy"
1422,THE FALL OF TROY,"Helping the work, with rollers underfoot"
1423,THE FALL OF TROY,"And ropes around the neck. It climbed our walls,"
1424,THE FALL OF TROY,"The deadly engine. Boys, unwedded girls"
1425,THE FALL OF TROY,"Sang alleluias round it, all rejoicing"
1426,THE FALL OF TROY,"To have a hand on the tow-rope. It came nearer,"
1427,THE FALL OF TROY,"Threatening, gliding, into the very city."
1428,THE FALL OF TROY,"O motherland! O Ilium, home of gods,"
1429,THE FALL OF TROY,"O walls of Troy! Four times it stopped, four times"
1430,THE FALL OF TROY,"The sound of arms came from it, and we pressed on,"
1431,THE FALL OF TROY,"Unheedful, blind in madness, till we set it,"
1432,THE FALL OF TROY,"Ill-omened thing, on the citadel we worshipped."
1433,THE FALL OF TROY,"And even when Cassandra gave us warning,"
1434,THE FALL OF TROY,We never believed her; so a god had ordered.
1435,THE FALL OF TROY,"That day, our last, poor wretches, we were happy,"
1436,THE FALL OF TROY,Garlanding the temples of the gods
1437,THE FALL OF TROY,All through the town.
1438,THE FALL OF TROY,
1439,THE FALL OF TROY,"And the sky turned, and darkness"
1440,THE FALL OF TROY,"Came from the ocean, the great shade covering earth"
1441,THE FALL OF TROY,"And heaven, and the trickery of the Greeks."
1442,THE FALL OF TROY,"Sprawling along the walls, the Trojans slumbered,"
1443,THE FALL OF TROY,"Sleep holding their weary limbs, and the Greek armada,"
1444,THE FALL OF TROY,"From Tenedos, under the friendly silence"
1445,THE FALL OF TROY,"Of a still moon, came surely on. The flagship"
1446,THE FALL OF TROY,"Blazed at the masthead with a sudden signal,"
1447,THE FALL OF TROY,"And Sinon, guarded by the fates, the hostile"
1448,THE FALL OF TROY,"Will of the gods, swung loose the bolts; the Greeks"
1449,THE FALL OF TROY,Came out of the wooden womb. The air received them
1450,THE FALL OF TROY,"The happy captains, Sthenelus, Ulysses,"
1451,THE FALL OF TROY,"Thessandrus, Acamas, Achilles’ son"
1452,THE FALL OF TROY,"Called Neoptolemus, Thoas, Machaon,"
1453,THE FALL OF TROY,"Epeos, who designed the thing,--they all"
1454,THE FALL OF TROY,"Came sliding down the rope, and Menelaus"
1455,THE FALL OF TROY,Was with them in the storming of a city
1456,THE FALL OF TROY,"Buried in sleep and wine. The watch was murdered,"
1457,THE FALL OF TROY,"The open doors welcome the rush of comrades,"
1458,THE FALL OF TROY,They marshal the determined ranks for battle.
1459,THE FALL OF TROY,
1460,THE FALL OF TROY,It was the time when the first sleep begins
1461,THE FALL OF TROY,"For weary mortals, heaven’s most welcome gift."
1462,THE FALL OF TROY,"In sleep, before my eyes, I seemed to see"
1463,THE FALL OF TROY,"Hector, most sorrowful, black with bloody dust,"
1464,THE FALL OF TROY,"Torn, as he had been, by Achilles’ car,"
1465,THE FALL OF TROY,The thong-marks on his swollen feet. How changed
1466,THE FALL OF TROY,"He was from that great Hector who came, once,"
1467,THE FALL OF TROY,"Triumphant in Achilles’ spoil, from hurling"
1468,THE FALL OF TROY,"Fire at the Grecian ships. With ragged beard,"
1469,THE FALL OF TROY,"Hair matted with his blood, wearing the wounds"
1470,THE FALL OF TROY,"He earned around the walls of Troy, he stood there."
1471,THE FALL OF TROY,"It seemed that I spoke first:--‘O light of Troy,"
1472,THE FALL OF TROY,"Our surest hope, we have long been waiting for you,"
1473,THE FALL OF TROY,"What shores have kept you from us? Many deaths,"
1474,THE FALL OF TROY,"Much suffering, have visited our city,"
1475,THE FALL OF TROY,And we are tired. Why do I see these wounds?
1476,THE FALL OF TROY,What shame has caused them?’ Those were foolish questions;
1477,THE FALL OF TROY,"He made no answer but a sigh or a groan,"
1478,THE FALL OF TROY,"And then: ‘Alas, O goddess-born! Take flight,"
1479,THE FALL OF TROY,"Escape these flames! The enemy has the walls,"
1480,THE FALL OF TROY,Troy topples from her lofty height; enough
1481,THE FALL OF TROY,Has been paid out to Priam and to country.
1482,THE FALL OF TROY,"Could any hand have saved them, Hector’s would have."
1483,THE FALL OF TROY,"Troy trusts to you her household gods, commending"
1484,THE FALL OF TROY,"Her holy things to you; take them, companions"
1485,THE FALL OF TROY,"Of destiny; seek walls for them, and a city"
1486,THE FALL OF TROY,"To be established, a long sea-wandering over.’"
1487,THE FALL OF TROY,From the inner shrine he carried Vesta’s chaplets
1488,THE FALL OF TROY,"In his own hands, and her undying fire."
1489,THE FALL OF TROY,
1490,THE FALL OF TROY,"Meanwhile, the city is all confusion and sorrow;"
1491,THE FALL OF TROY,"My father Anchises’ house, remote and sheltered"
1492,THE FALL OF TROY,"Among its trees, was not so far away"
1493,THE FALL OF TROY,"But I could hear the noises, always clearer,"
1494,THE FALL OF TROY,"The thickening din of war. Breaking from sleep,"
1495,THE FALL OF TROY,"I climb to the roof-top, listening and straining"
1496,THE FALL OF TROY,The way a shepherd does on the top of a mountain
1497,THE FALL OF TROY,"When fire goes over the corn, and the winds are roaring,"
1498,THE FALL OF TROY,Or the rush of a mountain torrent drowns the fields
1499,THE FALL OF TROY,And the happy crops and the work of men and oxen
1500,THE FALL OF TROY,And even drags great trees over. And then I knew
1501,THE FALL OF TROY,The truth indeed; the craft of the Greeks was hidden
1502,THE FALL OF TROY,"No longer from my sight. The house of a neighbor,"
1503,THE FALL OF TROY,"Deiphobus, went up in flames; next door,"
1504,THE FALL OF TROY,Ucalegon was burning. Sigeum’s water
1505,THE FALL OF TROY,"Gave back the glow. Men shouted, and the trumpets"
1506,THE FALL OF TROY,"Blared loud. I grab my arms, with little purpose,"
1507,THE FALL OF TROY,"There was no sense in it, but my heart was burning"
1508,THE FALL OF TROY,"To mass a band for war, rush to the hilltop"
1509,THE FALL OF TROY,With comrades at my side. Anger and frenzy
1510,THE FALL OF TROY,Hurry me on. A decent death in battle
1511,THE FALL OF TROY,"Is a helpful thought, sometimes."
1512,THE FALL OF TROY,
1513,THE FALL OF TROY,"And here came Panthus, running from the weapons,"
1514,THE FALL OF TROY,"Priest of Apollo, and a son of Othrys,"
1515,THE FALL OF TROY,"With holy relics in his hands, and dragging"
1516,THE FALL OF TROY,"His little grandson, here came Panthus, running"
1517,THE FALL OF TROY,"In madness to my door. ‘How goes it, Panthus?"
1518,THE FALL OF TROY,"What stronghold still is ours?’ I had hardly spoken,"
1519,THE FALL OF TROY,"When he began, with a groan: ‘It has come, this day"
1520,THE FALL OF TROY,"Will be our last, and we can not escape it."
1521,THE FALL OF TROY,"Trojans we have been, Troy has been, and glory"
1522,THE FALL OF TROY,Is ours no more. Fierce Jupiter has taken
1523,THE FALL OF TROY,"Everything off to Argos, and Greeks lord it"
1524,THE FALL OF TROY,"In a town on fire. The horse, high in the city,"
1525,THE FALL OF TROY,"Pours out armed men, and Sinon, arrogant victor,"
1526,THE FALL OF TROY,"Lights up more fires. The gates are standing open,"
1527,THE FALL OF TROY,"And men are there by the thousands, ever as many"
1528,THE FALL OF TROY,As came once from Mycenae; others block
1529,THE FALL OF TROY,"The narrow streets, with weapons drawn; the blades"
1530,THE FALL OF TROY,Flash in the dark; the point is set for murder.
1531,THE FALL OF TROY,"A few of the guards are trying, striking blindly,"
1532,THE FALL OF TROY,For all the good it does.’
1533,THE FALL OF TROY,
1534,THE FALL OF TROY,"His words, or the gods’ purpose, swept me on"
1535,THE FALL OF TROY,"Toward fire and arms, where the grim furies call,"
1536,THE FALL OF TROY,"And the clamor and confusion, reaching heaven."
1537,THE FALL OF TROY,"Ripheus joined me, Epytus, mighty in arms,"
1538,THE FALL OF TROY,"Came to my side in the moonlight, Hypanis, Dymas,"
1539,THE FALL OF TROY,"And young Coroebus, Mygdon’s son, poor youngster,"
1540,THE FALL OF TROY,"Mad with a hopeless passion for Cassandra,"
1541,THE FALL OF TROY,"He wanted to help Priam, but never heeded"
1542,THE FALL OF TROY,The warnings of his loved one.
1543,THE FALL OF TROY,
1544,THE FALL OF TROY,As they ranged
1545,THE FALL OF TROY,"Themselves for battle, eager, I addressed them:"
1546,THE FALL OF TROY,"‘O brave young hearts, it will do no good; no matter."
1547,THE FALL OF TROY,"Even if your will is fixed, to follow a leader"
1548,THE FALL OF TROY,"Taking the final risk, you can’t help seeing"
1549,THE FALL OF TROY,"The fortune of our state. The gods have gone,"
1550,THE FALL OF TROY,"They have left their shrines and altars, and the power"
1551,THE FALL OF TROY,They once upheld is fallen. You are helping
1552,THE FALL OF TROY,"A town already burnt. So let us die,"
1553,THE FALL OF TROY,Rush into arms. One safety for the vanquished
1554,THE FALL OF TROY,Is to have hope of none.’
1555,THE FALL OF TROY,
1556,THE FALL OF TROY,"They were young, and angry."
1557,THE FALL OF TROY,"Like wolves, marauders in black mist, whom hunger"
1558,THE FALL OF TROY,"Drives blindly on, whose whelps, abandoned, wait them"
1559,THE FALL OF TROY,"Dry-jawed, so we went on, through foes, through weapons,"
1560,THE FALL OF TROY,"To certain death; we made for the heart of the city,"
1561,THE FALL OF TROY,Black night around us with its hollow shadow.
1562,THE FALL OF TROY,"Who could explain that night’s destruction, equal"
1563,THE FALL OF TROY,"Its agony with tears? The ancient city,"
1564,THE FALL OF TROY,"A power for many years, comes down, and corpses"
1565,THE FALL OF TROY,Lie littering the streets and homes and altars.
1566,THE FALL OF TROY,Not only Trojans die. The old-time valor
1567,THE FALL OF TROY,"Returns to the vanquished heart, and the Greek victors"
1568,THE FALL OF TROY,"Know what it is to fall. Everywhere sorrow,"
1569,THE FALL OF TROY,"Everywhere panic, everywhere the image"
1570,THE FALL OF TROY,"Of death, made manifold."
1571,THE FALL OF TROY,
1572,THE FALL OF TROY,"Out of a crowd of Greeks comes one Androgeos,"
1573,THE FALL OF TROY,"Thinking us allies, hailing us as friendly:"
1574,THE FALL OF TROY,"‘Why men, where have you been, you dawdling fellows?"
1575,THE FALL OF TROY,"Hurry along! Here is plunder for the taking,"
1576,THE FALL OF TROY,"Others are busy at it, and you just coming"
1577,THE FALL OF TROY,From the high ships!’ And then he knew he had blundered;
1578,THE FALL OF TROY,"He had fallen in with foes, who gave no answer."
1579,THE FALL OF TROY,"He stopped, stepped back, like a man who treads on a serpent"
1580,THE FALL OF TROY,"Unseen in the rough brush, and then in panic"
1581,THE FALL OF TROY,Draws back as the purple neck swells out in anger.
1582,THE FALL OF TROY,"Even so, Androgeos pulled away in terror."
1583,THE FALL OF TROY,"We rush them, swarm all over them; they are frightened,"
1584,THE FALL OF TROY,"They do not know their ground, and fortune favors"
1585,THE FALL OF TROY,"Our first endeavor. Coroebus, a little crazy"
1586,THE FALL OF TROY,"With nerve and luck, cries out: ‘Comrades, where fortune"
1587,THE FALL OF TROY,"First shows the way and sides with us, we follow."
1588,THE FALL OF TROY,"Let us change our shields, put on the Grecian emblems!"
1589,THE FALL OF TROY,"All’s fair in war: we lick them or we trick them,"
1590,THE FALL OF TROY,"And what’s the odds?’ He takes Androgeos’ helmet,"
1591,THE FALL OF TROY,"Whose plume streams over his head, takes up the shield"
1592,THE FALL OF TROY,"With proud device, and fits the sword to his side."
1593,THE FALL OF TROY,"And Ripheus does the same, and so does Dymas,"
1594,THE FALL OF TROY,"And all the others, happily, being armed"
1595,THE FALL OF TROY,"With spoil, new-won. We join the Greeks, all going"
1596,THE FALL OF TROY,"Under no gods of ours, in the night’s darkness"
1597,THE FALL OF TROY,"Wade into many a fight, and Greeks by the dozens"
1598,THE FALL OF TROY,We send to hell. And some of them in panic
1599,THE FALL OF TROY,"Speed to the ships; they know that shore, and trust it,"
1600,THE FALL OF TROY,And some of them--these were the abject cowards--
1601,THE FALL OF TROY,"Climb scrambling up the horse’s sides, again"
1602,THE FALL OF TROY,Take refuge in the womb.
1603,THE FALL OF TROY,
1604,THE FALL OF TROY,It is not for men to trust unwilling gods.
1605,THE FALL OF TROY,"Cassandra was being dragged from Pallas’ temple,"
1606,THE FALL OF TROY,"Her hair loosed to the wind, her eyes turned upward"
1607,THE FALL OF TROY,To heaven for mercy; they had bound her hands.
1608,THE FALL OF TROY,Coroebus could not bear that sight; in madness
1609,THE FALL OF TROY,"He threw himself upon them, and he died."
1610,THE FALL OF TROY,"We followed, all of us, into the thick of it,"
1611,THE FALL OF TROY,"And were cut down, not only by Greeks; the rooftops,"
1612,THE FALL OF TROY,"Held by our friends, rained weapons: we were wearing"
1613,THE FALL OF TROY,"Greek crests and armor, and they did not know us."
1614,THE FALL OF TROY,"And the Greeks came on, shouting with anger, burning"
1615,THE FALL OF TROY,"To foil that rescue; there was Menelaus,"
1616,THE FALL OF TROY,"And Agamemnon, and the savage Ajax,"
1617,THE FALL OF TROY,And a whole army of them. Hurricanes
1618,THE FALL OF TROY,"Rage the same way, when winds from different quarters"
1619,THE FALL OF TROY,"Clash in the sky, and the forest groans, and Neptune"
1620,THE FALL OF TROY,Storms underneath the ocean. Those we routed
1621,THE FALL OF TROY,Once in the dark came back again from the byways
1622,THE FALL OF TROY,"And alleys of the town; they mark our shields,"
1623,THE FALL OF TROY,"Our lying weapons, and our foreign voices."
1624,THE FALL OF TROY,Of course we are outnumbered. Peneleus
1625,THE FALL OF TROY,"It was, who slew Coroebus, at the altar"
1626,THE FALL OF TROY,"Sacred to Pallas. Ripheus fell, a man"
1627,THE FALL OF TROY,"Most just of all the Trojans, most fair-minded."
1628,THE FALL OF TROY,"The gods thought otherwise. Hypanis, Dymas,"
1629,THE FALL OF TROY,"Were slain by their own men, and Panthus’ goodness"
1630,THE FALL OF TROY,"Was no protection, nor his priestly office."
1631,THE FALL OF TROY,"I call to witness Troy, her fires, her ashes,"
1632,THE FALL OF TROY,And the last agonies of all our people
1633,THE FALL OF TROY,That in that hour I ran from no encounter
1634,THE FALL OF TROY,"With any Greek, and if the fates had been"
1635,THE FALL OF TROY,"For me to fall in battle, there I earned it."
1636,THE FALL OF TROY,"The current swept me off, with two companions,"
1637,THE FALL OF TROY,"One, Iphitus, too slow with age, the other,"
1638,THE FALL OF TROY,"Pelias, limping from Ulysses’ wound."
1639,THE FALL OF TROY,The noise kept calling us to Priam’s palace.
1640,THE FALL OF TROY,
1641,THE FALL OF TROY,There might have been no fighting and no dying
1642,THE FALL OF TROY,"Through all the city, such a battle raged"
1643,THE FALL OF TROY,"Here, from the ground to roof-top. At the threshold"
1644,THE FALL OF TROY,"Waves of assault were breaking, and the Greeks"
1645,THE FALL OF TROY,"Were climbing, rung by rung, along the ladders,"
1646,THE FALL OF TROY,"Using one hand, the right one up and forward"
1647,THE FALL OF TROY,"Over the battlements, the left one thrust"
1648,THE FALL OF TROY,In the protecting shield. And over their heads
1649,THE FALL OF TROY,"The Trojans pried up towers and planking, wrecking"
1650,THE FALL OF TROY,"The building; gilded beams, the spoils of their fathers,"
1651,THE FALL OF TROY,Were ample weapons for the final moment.
1652,THE FALL OF TROY,"Some had the doorways blocked, others, behind them,"
1653,THE FALL OF TROY,Were ready with drawn swords. We had a moment
1654,THE FALL OF TROY,When help seemed possible: new reinforcement
1655,THE FALL OF TROY,Might yet relieve the palace.
1656,THE FALL OF TROY,"There was a secret entrance there, a passage"
1657,THE FALL OF TROY,"All the way through the building, a postern gate,"
1658,THE FALL OF TROY,"Where, while the kingdom stood, Andromache"
1659,THE FALL OF TROY,"Would go, alone, or bring the little boy,"
1660,THE FALL OF TROY,"Astyanax, to Hector’s father and mother."
1661,THE FALL OF TROY,"I climbed to the top of the roof, where the poor Trojans"
1662,THE FALL OF TROY,Were hurling down their unavailing darts.
1663,THE FALL OF TROY,"A tower stood on the very edge, a look-out"
1664,THE FALL OF TROY,"Over all Troy, the ships and camp of the Greeks."
1665,THE FALL OF TROY,"This we attacked with steel, where the joints were weakest,"
1666,THE FALL OF TROY,"And pried it up, and shoved it over. It crashed."
1667,THE FALL OF TROY,"A noisy ruin, over the hostile columns;"
1668,THE FALL OF TROY,But more kept coming up; the shower of stones
1669,THE FALL OF TROY,And darts continued raining.
1670,THE FALL OF TROY,"Before the entrance, at the very threshold"
1671,THE FALL OF TROY,"Stood Pyrrhus, flashing proudly in bronze light,"
1672,THE FALL OF TROY,"Sleek as a serpent coming into the open,"
1673,THE FALL OF TROY,"Fed on rank herbs, wintering under the ground,"
1674,THE FALL OF TROY,"The old slough cast, the new skin shining, rolling"
1675,THE FALL OF TROY,"His slippery length, reaching his neck to the sun,"
1676,THE FALL OF TROY,While the forked tongue darts from the mouth. Automedon
1677,THE FALL OF TROY,"Was with him, Periphas, Achilles’ driver,"
1678,THE FALL OF TROY,"A giant of a man, and the host from Scyros,"
1679,THE FALL OF TROY,"All closing in on the palace, and hurling flames."
1680,THE FALL OF TROY,"Among the foremost, Pyrrhus, swinging an axe,"
1681,THE FALL OF TROY,"Burst through, wrenched the bronze doors out of their hinges,"
1682,THE FALL OF TROY,"Smashed through the panelling, turned it into a window."
1683,THE FALL OF TROY,"The long halls came to view, the inner chambers"
1684,THE FALL OF TROY,Of Priam and the older kings; they see
1685,THE FALL OF TROY,Armed warriors at the threshold.
1686,THE FALL OF TROY,"Within, it is all confusion, women wailing,"
1687,THE FALL OF TROY,"Pitiful noise, groaning, and blows; the din"
1688,THE FALL OF TROY,Reaches the golden stars. The trembling mothers
1689,THE FALL OF TROY,"Wander, not knowing where, or find a spot"
1690,THE FALL OF TROY,To cling to; they would hold and kiss the doors.
1691,THE FALL OF TROY,"Pyrrhus comes on, aggressive as his father;"
1692,THE FALL OF TROY,No barrier holds him back; the gate is battered
1693,THE FALL OF TROY,As the ram smashes at it; the doors come down.
1694,THE FALL OF TROY,"Force finds a way: the Greeks pour in, they slaughter"
1695,THE FALL OF TROY,The first ones in their path; they fill the courtyard
1696,THE FALL OF TROY,"With soldiery, wilder than any river"
1697,THE FALL OF TROY,In flood over the banks and dikes and ploughland.
1698,THE FALL OF TROY,"I saw them, Pyrrhus, going mad with murder,"
1699,THE FALL OF TROY,"And Atreus’ twin sons, and Hecuba"
1700,THE FALL OF TROY,"I saw, and all her daughters, and poor old Priam,"
1701,THE FALL OF TROY,His blood polluting the altars he had hallowed.
1702,THE FALL OF TROY,"The fifty marriage-chambers, the proud hope"
1703,THE FALL OF TROY,"Of an everlasting line, are violated,"
1704,THE FALL OF TROY,The doors with the golden spoil are turned to splinters.
1705,THE FALL OF TROY,Whatever the fire has spared the Greeks take over.
1706,THE FALL OF TROY,
1707,THE FALL OF TROY,"You would ask, perhaps, about the fate of Priam?"
1708,THE FALL OF TROY,"When he saw the city fall, and the doors of the palace"
1709,THE FALL OF TROY,"Ripped from the hinge, and the enemy pouring in,"
1710,THE FALL OF TROY,"Old as he was, he went and found his armor,"
1711,THE FALL OF TROY,"Unused so many years, and his old shoulders"
1712,THE FALL OF TROY,"Shook as he put it on. He took his sword,"
1713,THE FALL OF TROY,"A useless weapon, and, doomed to die, went rushing"
1714,THE FALL OF TROY,Into the midst of the foe. There was an altar
1715,THE FALL OF TROY,"In the open court-yard, shaded by a laurel"
1716,THE FALL OF TROY,"Whose shadow darkened the household gods, and here"
1717,THE FALL OF TROY,"Hecuba and her daughters had come thronging,"
1718,THE FALL OF TROY,Like doves by a black storm driven. They were praying
1719,THE FALL OF TROY,"Here at the altar, and clinging to the gods,"
1720,THE FALL OF TROY,Whatever image was left. And the queen saw Priam
1721,THE FALL OF TROY,"In the arms of his youth. ‘O my unhappy husband,’"
1722,THE FALL OF TROY,"She cried, ‘have you gone mad, to dress yourself"
1723,THE FALL OF TROY,"For battle, so? It is all no use; the time"
1724,THE FALL OF TROY,Needs better help than yours; not even my Hector
1725,THE FALL OF TROY,"Could help us now. Come to me, come to the altar;"
1726,THE FALL OF TROY,"It will protect us, or at least will let us"
1727,THE FALL OF TROY,Die all together.’ And she drew him to her.
1728,THE FALL OF TROY,
1729,THE FALL OF TROY,"Just then through darts, through weapons, came Polites,"
1730,THE FALL OF TROY,"A son of Priam, fleeing deadly Pyrrhus,"
1731,THE FALL OF TROY,"Down the long colonnades and empty hallways,"
1732,THE FALL OF TROY,"Wounded, and Pyrrhus after him, vicious, eager"
1733,THE FALL OF TROY,"For the last spear-thrust, and he drives it home;"
1734,THE FALL OF TROY,"Polites falls, and his life goes out with his blood,"
1735,THE FALL OF TROY,"Father and mother watching. And then Priam,"
1736,THE FALL OF TROY,"In the very grip of death, cried out in anger:--"
1737,THE FALL OF TROY,"‘If there is any righteousness in heaven,"
1738,THE FALL OF TROY,"To care about such wickedness, the gods"
1739,THE FALL OF TROY,Will have the right reward and thanks to offer
1740,THE FALL OF TROY,"A man like this, who has made a father witness"
1741,THE FALL OF TROY,"The murder of his son, the worst pollution!"
1742,THE FALL OF TROY,You claim to be Achilles’ son. You liar!
1743,THE FALL OF TROY,"Achilles had some reverence, respected"
1744,THE FALL OF TROY,A suppliant’s right and trust; he gave me back
1745,THE FALL OF TROY,"My Hector’s lifeless body for the tomb,"
1746,THE FALL OF TROY,And let me go to my kingdom.’ With the word
1747,THE FALL OF TROY,"He flung a feeble spear, which dropped, deflected"
1748,THE FALL OF TROY,From the rough bronze; it had hung there for a moment.
1749,THE FALL OF TROY,"And Pyrrhus sneered: ‘So, go and tell my father"
1750,THE FALL OF TROY,"The latest news: do not forget to mention,"
1751,THE FALL OF TROY,"Old messenger-boy, my villainous behavior,"
1752,THE FALL OF TROY,And what a bastard Pyrrhus is. Now die!’
1753,THE FALL OF TROY,"He dragged the old man, trembling, to the altar,"
1754,THE FALL OF TROY,Slipping in his son’s blood; he grabbed his hair
1755,THE FALL OF TROY,"With the left hand, and the right drove home the sword"
1756,THE FALL OF TROY,"Deep in the side, to the hilt. And so fell Priam,"
1757,THE FALL OF TROY,"Who had seen Troy burn and her walls come down, once monarch,"
1758,THE FALL OF TROY,Proud ruler over the peoples and lands of Asia.
1759,THE FALL OF TROY,"He lies, a nameless body, on the shore,"
1760,THE FALL OF TROY,"Dismembered, huge, the head torn from the shoulders."
1761,THE FALL OF TROY,
1762,THE FALL OF TROY,"Grim horror, then, came home to me. I saw"
1763,THE FALL OF TROY,"My father when I saw the king, the life"
1764,THE FALL OF TROY,Going out with the cruel wound. I saw Creusa
1765,THE FALL OF TROY,"Forsaken, my abandoned home, Iulus,"
1766,THE FALL OF TROY,My little son. I looked around. They all
1767,THE FALL OF TROY,"Had gone, exhausted, flung down from the walls,"
1768,THE FALL OF TROY,"Or dead in the fire, and I was left alone."
1769,THE FALL OF TROY,
1770,THE FALL OF TROY,"And I saw Helen, hiding, of all places,"
1771,THE FALL OF TROY,"At Vesta’s shrine, and clinging there in silence,"
1772,THE FALL OF TROY,"But the bright flames lit the scene. That hated woman,"
1773,THE FALL OF TROY,"Fearing both Trojan anger and Greek vengeance,"
1774,THE FALL OF TROY,"A common fury to both lands, was crouching"
1775,THE FALL OF TROY,Beside the altar. Anger flared up in me
1776,THE FALL OF TROY,"For punishment and vengeance. Should she then,"
1777,THE FALL OF TROY,"I thought, come home to Sparta safe, uninjured"
1778,THE FALL OF TROY,"Walk through Mycenae, a triumphant queen?"
1779,THE FALL OF TROY,"See husband, home, parents and children, tended"
1780,THE FALL OF TROY,"By Trojan slave-girls? This, with Priam fallen"
1781,THE FALL OF TROY,"And Troy burnt down, and the shore soaked in blood?"
1782,THE FALL OF TROY,"Never! No memorable name, I knew,"
1783,THE FALL OF TROY,"Was won by punishing women, yet, for me,"
1784,THE FALL OF TROY,There might be praise for the just abolition
1785,THE FALL OF TROY,"Of this unholiness, and satisfaction"
1786,THE FALL OF TROY,In vengeance for the ashes of my people.
1787,THE FALL OF TROY,"All this I may have said aloud, in frenzy,"
1788,THE FALL OF TROY,"As I rushed on, when to my sight there came"
1789,THE FALL OF TROY,"A vision of my lovely mother, radiant"
1790,THE FALL OF TROY,"In the dark night, a goddess manifest,"
1791,THE FALL OF TROY,As tall and fair as when she walks in heaven.
1792,THE FALL OF TROY,"She caught me by the hand and stopped me:--‘Son,"
1793,THE FALL OF TROY,"What sorrow rouses this relentless anger,"
1794,THE FALL OF TROY,This violence? Do you care for me no longer?
1795,THE FALL OF TROY,"Consider others first, your aged father,"
1796,THE FALL OF TROY,Anchises; is your wife Creusa living?
1797,THE FALL OF TROY,"Where is Iulus? Greeks are all around them,"
1798,THE FALL OF TROY,"Only my love between them, fire and sword."
1799,THE FALL OF TROY,"It is not for you to blame the Spartan woman,"
1800,THE FALL OF TROY,"Daughter of Tyndareus, or even Paris."
1801,THE FALL OF TROY,"The gods are the ones, the high gods are relentless"
1802,THE FALL OF TROY,"It is they who bring this power down, who topple"
1803,THE FALL OF TROY,Troy from the high foundation. Look! Your vision
1804,THE FALL OF TROY,"Is mortal dull, I will take the cloud away,--"
1805,THE FALL OF TROY,Fear not a mother’s counsel. Where you see
1806,THE FALL OF TROY,"Rock torn from rock, and smoke and dust in billows,"
1807,THE FALL OF TROY,"Neptune is working, plying the trident, prying"
1808,THE FALL OF TROY,"The walls from their foundations. And see Juno,"
1809,THE FALL OF TROY,"Fiercest of all, holding the Scaean gates,"
1810,THE FALL OF TROY,"Girt with the steel, and calling from the ships"
1811,THE FALL OF TROY,"Implacable companions. On the towers,--"
1812,THE FALL OF TROY,"Turn, and be certain--Pallas takes command"
1813,THE FALL OF TROY,"Gleaming with Gorgon and storm-cloud. Even Jove,"
1814,THE FALL OF TROY,"Our father, nerves the Greeks with fire and spirit,"
1815,THE FALL OF TROY,And spurs the other gods against the Trojans.
1816,THE FALL OF TROY,"Hasten the flight, my son; no other labor"
1817,THE FALL OF TROY,Waits for accomplishment. I promise safety
1818,THE FALL OF TROY,Until you reach your father’s house.’ She had spoken
1819,THE FALL OF TROY,And vanished in the thickening night of shadows.
1820,THE FALL OF TROY,"Dread shapes come into vision, mighty powers,"
1821,THE FALL OF TROY,"Great gods at war with Troy, which, so it seemed,"
1822,THE FALL OF TROY,"Was sinking as I watched, with the same feeling"
1823,THE FALL OF TROY,As when on mountain-tops you see the loggers
1824,THE FALL OF TROY,"Hacking an ash-tree down, and it always threatens"
1825,THE FALL OF TROY,"To topple, nodding a little, and the leaves"
1826,THE FALL OF TROY,"Trembling when no wind stirs, and dies of its wounds"
1827,THE FALL OF TROY,"With one long loud last groan, and dirt from the ridges"
1828,THE FALL OF TROY,Heaves up as it goes down with roots in air.
1829,THE FALL OF TROY,"Divinity my guide, I leave the roof-top,"
1830,THE FALL OF TROY,"I pass unharmed through enemies and blazing,"
1831,THE FALL OF TROY,"Weapons give place to me, and flames retire."
1832,THE FALL OF TROY,
1833,THE FALL OF TROY,"At last I reached the house, I found my father,"
1834,THE FALL OF TROY,The first one that I looked for. I meant to take him
1835,THE FALL OF TROY,"To the safety of the hills, but he was stubborn,"
1836,THE FALL OF TROY,"Refusing longer life or barren exile,"
1837,THE FALL OF TROY,"Since Troy was dead. ‘You have the strength,’ he told me,"
1838,THE FALL OF TROY,"‘You are young enough, take flight. For me, had heaven"
1839,THE FALL OF TROY,"Wanted to save my life, they would have spared"
1840,THE FALL OF TROY,"This home for me. We have seen enough destruction,"
1841,THE FALL OF TROY,"More than enough, survived a captured city."
1842,THE FALL OF TROY,"Speak to me as a corpse laid out for burial,"
1843,THE FALL OF TROY,"A quick farewell, and go. Death I shall find"
1844,THE FALL OF TROY,"With my own hand; the enemy will pity,"
1845,THE FALL OF TROY,Or look for spoil. The loss of burial
1846,THE FALL OF TROY,Is nothing at all. I have been living too long
1847,THE FALL OF TROY,"Hated by gods and useless, since the time"
1848,THE FALL OF TROY,Jove blasted me with lightning wind and fire.’
1849,THE FALL OF TROY,"He would not move, however we wept, Creusa,"
1850,THE FALL OF TROY,"Ascanius, all the house, insistent, pleading"
1851,THE FALL OF TROY,That he should not bring all to ruin with him.
1852,THE FALL OF TROY,"He would not move, he would not listen. Again"
1853,THE FALL OF TROY,"I rush to arms, I pray for death; what else"
1854,THE FALL OF TROY,"Was left to me? ‘Dear father, were you thinking"
1855,THE FALL OF TROY,"I could abandon you, and go? what son"
1856,THE FALL OF TROY,Could bear a thought so monstrous? If the gods
1857,THE FALL OF TROY,"Want nothing to be left of so great a city,"
1858,THE FALL OF TROY,"If you are bound, or pleased, to add us all"
1859,THE FALL OF TROY,"To the wreck of Troy, the way is open for it--"
1860,THE FALL OF TROY,Pyrrhus will soon be here; from the blood of Priam
1861,THE FALL OF TROY,"He comes; he slays the son before the father,"
1862,THE FALL OF TROY,"The sire at the altar-stone; O my dear mother,"
1863,THE FALL OF TROY,"Was it for this you saved me, brought me through"
1864,THE FALL OF TROY,"The fire and sword, to see our enemies"
1865,THE FALL OF TROY,"Here in the very house, and wife and son"
1866,THE FALL OF TROY,And father murdered in each other’s blood?
1867,THE FALL OF TROY,Bring me my arms; the last light calls the conquered.
1868,THE FALL OF TROY,"Let me go back to the Greeks, renew the battle,"
1869,THE FALL OF TROY,We shall not all of us die unavenged.’
1870,THE FALL OF TROY,
1871,THE FALL OF TROY,"Sword at my side, I was on the point of going,"
1872,THE FALL OF TROY,Working the left arm into the shield. Creusa
1873,THE FALL OF TROY,"Clung to me on the threshold, held my feet,"
1874,THE FALL OF TROY,"And made me see my little son:--‘Dear husband,"
1875,THE FALL OF TROY,"If you are bent on dying, take us with you,"
1876,THE FALL OF TROY,"But if you think there is any hope in fighting,"
1877,THE FALL OF TROY,"And you should know, stay and defend the house!"
1878,THE FALL OF TROY,"To whom are we abandoned, your father and son,"
1879,THE FALL OF TROY,"And I, once called your wife?’ She filled the house"
1880,THE FALL OF TROY,"With moaning outcry. And then something happened,"
1881,THE FALL OF TROY,"A wonderful portent. Over Iulus’ head,"
1882,THE FALL OF TROY,"Between our hands and faces, there appeared"
1883,THE FALL OF TROY,"A blaze of gentle light; a tongue of flame,"
1884,THE FALL OF TROY,"Harmless and innocent, was playing over"
1885,THE FALL OF TROY,"The softness of his hair, around his temples."
1886,THE FALL OF TROY,"We were afraid, we did our best to quench it"
1887,THE FALL OF TROY,"With our own hands, or water, but my father"
1888,THE FALL OF TROY,"Raised joyous eyes to heaven, and prayed aloud:--"
1889,THE FALL OF TROY,"‘Almighty Jupiter, if any prayer"
1890,THE FALL OF TROY,"Of ours has power to move you, look upon us,"
1891,THE FALL OF TROY,"Grant only this, if we have ever deserved it,"
1892,THE FALL OF TROY,"Grant us a sign, and ratify the omen!’"
1893,THE FALL OF TROY,"He had hardly spoken, when thunder on the left"
1894,THE FALL OF TROY,"Resounded, and a shooting star from heaven"
1895,THE FALL OF TROY,Drew a long trail of light across the shadows.
1896,THE FALL OF TROY,"We saw it cross above the house, and vanish"
1897,THE FALL OF TROY,"In the woods of Ida, a wake of gleaming light"
1898,THE FALL OF TROY,"Where it had sped, and a trail of sulphurous odor."
1899,THE FALL OF TROY,This was a victory: my father rose
1900,THE FALL OF TROY,"In worship of the gods and the holy star,"
1901,THE FALL OF TROY,"Crying: ‘I follow, son, wherever you lead;"
1902,THE FALL OF TROY,"There is no delay, not now; Gods of my fathers,"
1903,THE FALL OF TROY,"Preserve my house, my grandson; yours the omen,"
1904,THE FALL OF TROY,"And Troy is in your keeping. O my son,"
1905,THE FALL OF TROY,"I yield, I am ready to follow.’ But the fire"
1906,THE FALL OF TROY,"Came louder over the walls, the flames rolled nearer"
1907,THE FALL OF TROY,"Their burning tide. ‘Climb to my shoulders, father,"
1908,THE FALL OF TROY,"It will be no burden, so we are together,"
1909,THE FALL OF TROY,Meeting a common danger or salvation.
1910,THE FALL OF TROY,"Iulus, take my hand; Creusa, follow"
1911,THE FALL OF TROY,"A little way behind. Listen, you servants!"
1912,THE FALL OF TROY,"You will find, when you leave the city, an old temple"
1913,THE FALL OF TROY,That once belonged to Ceres; it has been tended
1914,THE FALL OF TROY,For many years with the worship of our fathers.
1915,THE FALL OF TROY,"There’s a little hill there, and a cypress tree;"
1916,THE FALL OF TROY,"And that’s where we shall meet, one way or another."
1917,THE FALL OF TROY,"And one thing more: you, father, are to carry"
1918,THE FALL OF TROY,"The holy objects and the gods of the household,"
1919,THE FALL OF TROY,"My hands are foul with battle and blood, I could not"
1920,THE FALL OF TROY,Touch them without pollution.’
1921,THE FALL OF TROY,
1922,THE FALL OF TROY,I bent down
1923,THE FALL OF TROY,And over my neck and shoulders spread the cover
1924,THE FALL OF TROY,"Of a tawny lion-skin, took up my burden;"
1925,THE FALL OF TROY,"Little Iulus held my hand, and trotted,"
1926,THE FALL OF TROY,"As best he could, beside me; Creusa followed."
1927,THE FALL OF TROY,We went on through the shadows. I had been
1928,THE FALL OF TROY,"Brave, so I thought, before, in the rain of weapons"
1929,THE FALL OF TROY,And the cloud of massing Greeks. But now I trembled
1930,THE FALL OF TROY,"At every breath of air, shook at a whisper,"
1931,THE FALL OF TROY,Fearful for both my burden and companion.
1932,THE FALL OF TROY,
1933,THE FALL OF TROY,"I was near the gates, and thinking we had made it,"
1934,THE FALL OF TROY,"But there was a sound, the tramp of marching feet,"
1935,THE FALL OF TROY,"And many of them, it seemed; my father, peering"
1936,THE FALL OF TROY,"Through the thick gloom, cried out:--‘Son, they are coming!"
1937,THE FALL OF TROY,"Flee, flee! I see their shields, their gleaming bronze.’"
1938,THE FALL OF TROY,Something or other took my senses from me
1939,THE FALL OF TROY,"In that confusion. I turned aside from the path,"
1940,THE FALL OF TROY,I do not know what happened then. Creusa
1941,THE FALL OF TROY,"Was lost; she had missed the road, or halted, weary,"
1942,THE FALL OF TROY,"For a brief rest. I do not know what happened,"
1943,THE FALL OF TROY,"She was not seen again; I had not looked back,"
1944,THE FALL OF TROY,"Nor even thought about her, till we came"
1945,THE FALL OF TROY,"To Ceres’ hallowed home. The count was perfect,"
1946,THE FALL OF TROY,"Only one missing there, the wife and mother."
1947,THE FALL OF TROY,"Whom did I not accuse, of gods and mortals,"
1948,THE FALL OF TROY,Then in my frenzy? What worse thing had happened
1949,THE FALL OF TROY,"In the city overthrown? I left Anchises,"
1950,THE FALL OF TROY,"My son, my household gods, to my companions,"
1951,THE FALL OF TROY,In a hiding-place in the valley; and I went back
1952,THE FALL OF TROY,"Into the city again, wearing my armor,"
1953,THE FALL OF TROY,"Ready, still one more time, for any danger."
1954,THE FALL OF TROY,"I found the walls again, the gate’s dark portals,"
1955,THE FALL OF TROY,"I followed my own footsteps back, but terror,"
1956,THE FALL OF TROY,Terror and silence were all I found. I went
1957,THE FALL OF TROY,"On to my house. She might, just might, have gone there."
1958,THE FALL OF TROY,"Only the Greeks were there, and fire devouring"
1959,THE FALL OF TROY,The very pinnacles. I tried Priam’s palace;
1960,THE FALL OF TROY,In the empty courtyards Phoenix and Ulysses
1961,THE FALL OF TROY,Guarded the spoils piled up at Juno’s altar.
1962,THE FALL OF TROY,"They had Trojan treasure there, loot from the altars,"
1963,THE FALL OF TROY,"Great drinking-bowls of gold, and stolen garments,"
1964,THE FALL OF TROY,And human beings. A line of boys and women
1965,THE FALL OF TROY,Stood trembling there.
1966,THE FALL OF TROY,"I took the risk of crying through the shadows,"
1967,THE FALL OF TROY,"Over and over, ‘Creusa!’ I kept calling,"
1968,THE FALL OF TROY,‘Creusa!’ and ‘Creusa!’ but no answer.
1969,THE FALL OF TROY,"No sense, no limit, to my endless rushing"
1970,THE FALL OF TROY,"All through the town; and then at last I saw her,"
1971,THE FALL OF TROY,"Or thought I did, her shadow a little taller"
1972,THE FALL OF TROY,Than I remembered. And she spoke to me
1973,THE FALL OF TROY,"Beside myself with terror:--‘O dear husband,"
1974,THE FALL OF TROY,What good is all this frantic grief? The gods
1975,THE FALL OF TROY,"Have willed it so, Creusa may not join you"
1976,THE FALL OF TROY,Out of this city; Jupiter denies it.
1977,THE FALL OF TROY,"Long exile lies ahead, and vast sea-reaches"
1978,THE FALL OF TROY,"The ships must furrow, till you come to land"
1979,THE FALL OF TROY,"Far in the West; rich fields are there, and a river"
1980,THE FALL OF TROY,"Flowing with gentle current; its name is Tiber,"
1981,THE FALL OF TROY,"And happy days await you there, a kingdom,"
1982,THE FALL OF TROY,A royal wife. Banish the tears of sorrow
1983,THE FALL OF TROY,Over Creusa lost. I shall never see
1984,THE FALL OF TROY,"The arrogant houses of the Myrmidons,"
1985,THE FALL OF TROY,Nor be a slave to any Grecian woman;
1986,THE FALL OF TROY,I am a Dardan woman; I am the wife
1987,THE FALL OF TROY,Of Venus’ son; it is Cybele who keeps me
1988,THE FALL OF TROY,"Here on these shores. And now farewell, and love"
1989,THE FALL OF TROY,"Our son.’ I wept, there was more to say; she left me,"
1990,THE FALL OF TROY,Vanishing into empty air. Three times
1991,THE FALL OF TROY,"I reached out toward her, and three times her image"
1992,THE FALL OF TROY,Fled like the breath of a wind or a dream on wings.
1993,THE FALL OF TROY,The night was over; I went back to my comrades.
1994,THE FALL OF TROY,
1995,THE FALL OF TROY,I was surprised to find so many more
1996,THE FALL OF TROY,"Had joined us, ready for exile, pitiful people,"
1997,THE FALL OF TROY,"Mothers, and men, and children, streaming in"
1998,THE FALL OF TROY,"From everywhere, looking for me to lead them"
1999,THE FALL OF TROY,Wherever I would. Over the hills of Ida
2000,THE FALL OF TROY,The morning-star was rising; in the town
2001,THE FALL OF TROY,"The Danaans held the gates, and help was hopeless."
2002,THE FALL OF TROY,"I gave it up, I lifted up my father,"
2003,THE FALL OF TROY,Together we sought the hills.
2004,THE FALL OF TROY,

2011,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,
2012,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,
2013,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,“After the gods’ decision to overthrow
2014,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The Asian world, the innocent house of Priam,"
2015,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And the proud city, built by Neptune, smoked"
2016,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"From the ruined ground, we were driven, different ways,"
2017,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"By heaven’s auguries, seeking lands forsaken."
2018,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Below Antandros, under Phrygian Ida,"
2019,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"We built a fleet, and gathered men, uncertain"
2020,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Of either direction or settlement. The summer
2021,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Had scarce begun, when at my father’s orders,"
2022,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"We spread our sails. I wept as I left the harbor,"
2023,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The fields where Troy had been. I was borne, an exile"
2024,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Over the deep, with son, companions, household,"
2025,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,And household gods.
2026,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,
2027,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Far off there lies a land,"
2028,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Sacred to Mars; the Thracians used to till it,"
2029,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Whose king was fierce Lycurgus; they were friendly,"
2030,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Of old, to Troy, when we were prosperous. Hither"
2031,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"I sailed, and on its curving shore established"
2032,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"A city site; Aeneadae, I called it."
2033,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"This I began, not knowing fate was adverse."
2034,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,
2035,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"I was offering my mother proper homage,"
2036,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And other gods, to bless the new beginnings,"
2037,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,I had a white bull ready as a victim
2038,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"To the king of the gods. There was a mound nearby,"
2039,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Bristling with myrtle and with cornel-bushes.
2040,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"I needed greenery to veil the altar,"
2041,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"But as I struggled with the leafy branches,"
2042,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,A fearful portent met my gaze. Black drops
2043,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Dripped from the ends of the roots, black blood was falling"
2044,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"On the torn ground, and a cold chill went through me."
2045,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,I tried again; the shoot resisted; blood
2046,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Followed again. Troubled, I prayed to the Nymphs,"
2047,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"To the father of the fields, to bless the vision,"
2048,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Remove the curse; and down on my knees I wrestled
2049,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Once more against the stubborn ground, and heard"
2050,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"A groan from under the hillock, and a voice crying:"
2051,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"‘Why mangle a poor wretch, Aeneas? Spare me,"
2052,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Here in the tomb, and save your hands pollution."
2053,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"You know me, I am Trojan-born, no stranger,"
2054,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"This is familiar blood. Alas! Take flight,"
2055,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Leave this remorseless land; the curse of greed
2056,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Lies heavy on it. I am Polydorus,"
2057,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Pierced by an iron harvest; out of my body
2058,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Rise javelins and lances.’ I was speechless,"
2059,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Stunned, in my terror."
2060,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,
2061,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Priam, forever unfortunate, had sent"
2062,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"This Polydorus on a secret mission,"
2063,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Once, to the king of Thrace, with gold for hiding"
2064,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,When the king despaired of the siege and the city’s fortune.
2065,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And when Troy fell, and Fortune failed, the Thracian"
2066,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Took Agamemnon’s side, broke off his duty,"
2067,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Slew Polydorus, took the gold. There is nothing"
2068,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,To which men are not driven by that hunger.
2069,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Once over my fear, I summoned all the leaders,"
2070,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"My father, too; I told them of the portent,"
2071,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Asked for their counsel. All agreed, a land"
2072,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,So stained with violence and violation
2073,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Was not for us to dwell in. Southward ho!
2074,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,For Polydorus we made restoration
2075,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,With funeral rites anew; earth rose again
2076,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Above his outraged mound; dark fillets made
2077,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The altar sorrowful, and cypress boughs,"
2078,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,And the Trojan women loosed their hair in mourning.
2079,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"We offered milk in foaming bowls, and blood"
2080,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Warm from the victims, so to rest the spirit,"
2081,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,And cry aloud the voice of valediction.
2082,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,
2083,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Then, when we trust the sea again, and the wind"
2084,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Calls with a gentle whisper, we crowd the shores,"
2085,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Launch ship again, leave port, the lands and cities"
2086,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Fade out of sight once more.
2087,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,
2088,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,There is an island
2089,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,In the middle of the sea; the Nereids’ mother
2090,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,And Neptune hold it sacred. It used to wander
2091,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"By various coasts and shores, until Apollo,"
2092,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"In grateful memory, bound it fast, unmoving,"
2093,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Unfearful of winds, between two other islands"
2094,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Called Myconos and Gyaros. I sailed there;
2095,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Our band was weary, and the calmest harbor"
2096,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Gave us safe haven. This was Apollo’s city;
2097,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"We worshipped it on landing. And their king,"
2098,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Priest of Apollo also, came to meet us,"
2099,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"His temples bound with holy fillets, and laurel."
2100,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,His name was Anius; he knew Anchises
2101,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"As an old friend, and gave us joyful welcome."
2102,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,
2103,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Apollo’s temple was built of ancient rock,"
2104,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And there I prayed: ‘Grant us a home, Apollo,"
2105,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Give walls to weary men, a race, a city"
2106,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"That will abide; preserve Troy’s other fortress,"
2107,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,The remnant left by the Greeks and hard Achilles.
2108,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Whom do we follow? where are we bidden to go
2109,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"To find our settlement? An omen, father!’"
2110,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,
2111,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"I had scarcely spoken, when suddenly all things trembled,"
2112,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The doors, and the laurel, and the whole mountain moved,"
2113,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And the shrine was opened, and a rumbling sound"
2114,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Was heard. We knelt, most humbly; and a voice"
2115,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Came to our ears: ‘The land which brought you forth,"
2116,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Men of endurance, will receive you home."
2117,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Seek out your ancient mother. There your house
2118,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Will rule above all lands, your children’s children,"
2119,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"For countless generations.’ Apollo spoke,"
2120,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And we were joyful and confused, together:"
2121,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"What walls were those, calling the wanderers home?"
2122,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"My father, pondering history, made answer:"
2123,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"‘Hear, leaders; learn your hopes. There is a land"
2124,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Called Crete, an island in the midst of the sea,"
2125,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The cradle of our race; it has a mountain,"
2126,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Ida, like ours, a hundred mighty cities,"
2127,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Abounding wealth; if I recall correctly,"
2128,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Teucer, our greatest father, came from there"
2129,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,To the Rhoetean shores to found his kingdom.
2130,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Ilium was nothing then, the towers of Troy"
2131,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Undreamed of; men lived in the lowly valleys.
2132,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And Cybele, the Great Mother, came from Crete"
2133,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"With her clashing cymbals, and her grove of Ida"
2134,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Was named from that original; the silence
2135,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Of her mysterious rites, the harnessed lions"
2136,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Before her chariot wheels, all testify"
2137,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"To Cretan legend. Come, then, let us follow"
2138,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Where the gods lead, and seek the Cretan kingdom."
2139,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"It is not far; with Jupiter to favor,"
2140,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Three days will see us there.’ With prayer, he made"
2141,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Most solemn sacrifice, a bull to Neptune,"
2142,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"One to Apollo, to Winter a black heifer,"
2143,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,A white one for fair winds.
2144,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,
2145,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,The story ran
2146,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"That no one lived in Crete, Idomeneus"
2147,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Having left his father’s kingdom, that the houses"
2148,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Were empty now, dwellings vacated for us."
2149,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"We sailed from Delos, flying over the water"
2150,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Past Naxos, on whose heights the Bacchae revel,"
2151,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Past green Donysa, snowy Paros, skimming"
2152,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,The passages between the sea-sown islands.
2153,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"No crew would yield to another; there is shouting,"
2154,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And the cheer goes up, ‘To Crete, and the land of our fathers!’"
2155,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"A stern wind follows, and we reach the land."
2156,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,I am glad to be there; I lay out the walls
2157,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"For the chosen city, name it Pergamea,"
2158,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And the people are happy. _Love your hearths_, I told them,"
2159,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,_Build high the citadel_. The ships were steadied
2160,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"On the dry beach, the young were busy ploughing,"
2161,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Or planning marriage, and I was giving laws,"
2162,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Assigning homes. But the weather turned, the sky"
2163,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Grew sick, and from the tainted heaven came"
2164,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Pestilence and pollution, a deadly year"
2165,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,For people and harvest. Those who were not dying
2166,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Dragged weary bodies around; the Dog-Star scorched
2167,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The fields to barrenness; grass withered, corn"
2168,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Refused to ripen. ‘Over the sea again!’
2169,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"My father said, ‘let us return to Delos,"
2170,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Consult the oracle, implore Apollo"
2171,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,To show us kindliness; what end awaits
2172,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Our weary destiny, where does he bid us turn"
2173,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,For help in trouble?’
2174,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,
2175,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Sleep held all creatures over the earth at rest;
2176,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"In my own darkness visions came, the sacred"
2177,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Images of the household gods I had carried
2178,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"With me from Troy, out of the burning city."
2179,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"I saw them plain, in the flood of light, where the moon"
2180,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Streamed through the dormers. And they eased me, saying:"
2181,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"‘Apollo would tell you this, if you went over"
2182,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,The sea again to Delos; from him we come
2183,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"To you, with willing spirit. We came with you"
2184,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"From the burnt city, we have followed still"
2185,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,The swollen sea in the ships; in time to come
2186,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"We shall raise your sons to heaven, and dominion"
2187,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Shall crown their city. Prepare to build them walls,"
2188,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Great homes for greatness; do not flee the labor,"
2189,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The long, long toil of flight. Crete, says Apollo,"
2190,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Is not the place. There is a land in the West,"
2191,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Called by the Greeks, Hesperia: anciency"
2192,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,And might in arms and wealth enrich its soil.
2193,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The Oenotrians lived there once; now, rumor has it,"
2194,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,A younger race has called it Italy
2195,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"After the name of a leader, Italus."
2196,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Dardanus came from there, our ancestor,"
2197,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,As Iasius was. There is our dwelling-place.
2198,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Be happy, then, waken, and tell Anchises"
2199,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Our certain message: seek the land in the West.
2200,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Crete is forbidden country.’
2201,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,
2202,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The vision shook me, and the voice of the gods;"
2203,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"(It was not a dream, exactly; I seemed to know them,"
2204,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Their features, the veiled hair, the living presence.)"
2205,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"I woke in a sweat, held out my hands to heaven,"
2206,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And poured the pure libation for the altar,"
2207,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Then, gladly, to Anchises. He acknowledged"
2208,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"His own mistake, a natural confusion,"
2209,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Our stock was double, of course; no need of saying"
2210,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"We had more ancestors than one. ‘Cassandra,’"
2211,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Anchises said, ‘alone, now I remember,"
2212,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Foretold this fate; it seemed she was always talking
2213,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Of a land in the West, and Italian kingdoms, always."
2214,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,But who would ever have thought that any Trojans
2215,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Would reach the shores in the West? Or, for that matter,"
2216,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Who ever believed Cassandra? Let us yield
2217,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"To the warning of Apollo, and at his bidding"
2218,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Seek better fortunes.’ So we obeyed him,"
2219,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Leaving this place, where a few stayed, and sailing"
2220,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,The hollow keels over the mighty ocean.
2221,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,
2222,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"We were in deep water, and the land no longer"
2223,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Was visible, sky and ocean everywhere."
2224,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"A cloud, black-blue, loomed overhead, with night"
2225,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And tempest in it, and the water roughened"
2226,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"In shadow; winds piled up the sea, the billows"
2227,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Rose higher; we were scattered in the surges.
2228,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Clouds took away the daylight, and the night"
2229,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Was dark and wet in the sky, with lightning flashing."
2230,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"We wandered, off our course, in the dark of ocean,"
2231,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And our pilot, Palinurus, swore he could not"
2232,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Tell day from night, nor the way among the waters."
2233,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"For three lost days, three starless nights, we rode it,"
2234,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Saw land on the fourth, mountains and smoke arising."
2235,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The sails came down, we bent to the oars; the sailors"
2236,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Made the foam fly, sweeping the dark blue water."
2237,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"I was saved from the waves; the Strophades received me,"
2238,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"(The word means Turning-point in the Greek language),"
2239,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Ionian islands where the dire Celaeno
2240,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And other Harpies live, since Phineus’ house"
2241,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Was closed to them, and they feared their former tables."
2242,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,No fiercer plague of the gods’ anger ever
2243,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Rose out of hell, girls with the look of birds,"
2244,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Their bellies fouled, incontinent, their hands"
2245,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Like talons, and their faces pale with hunger."
2246,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"We sailed into the harbor, happy to see"
2247,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Good herds of cattle grazing over the grass
2248,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And goats, unshepherded. We cut them down"
2249,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And made our prayer and offering to Jove,"
2250,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Set trestles on the curving shore for feasting.
2251,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Down from the mountains with a fearful rush
2252,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And a sound of wings like metal came the Harpies,"
2253,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"To seize our banquet, smearing dirtiness"
2254,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Over it all, with a hideous kind of screaming"
2255,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,And a stinking smell. We found a secret hollow
2256,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Enclosed by trees, under a ledge of rock,"
2257,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Where shade played over; there we moved the tables
2258,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,And lit the fire again; the noisy Harpies
2259,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Came out of somewhere, sky, or rock, and harried"
2260,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The feast again, the filthy talons grabbing,"
2261,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The taint all through the air. _Take arms_, I ordered,"
2262,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"_We have to fight them_. And my comrades, hiding"
2263,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Their shields in the grass, lay with their swords beside them,"
2264,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And when the birds swooped screaming, and Misenus,"
2265,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Sounded the trumpet-signal, they rose to charge them,"
2266,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"A curious kind of battle, men with sword-blades"
2267,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Against the winged obscenities of ocean.
2268,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Their feathers felt no blow, their backs no wound,"
2269,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"They rose to the sky as rapidly as ever,"
2270,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Leaving the souvenirs of their foul traces
2271,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Over the ruined feast. And one, Celaeno,"
2272,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Perched on a lofty rock, squawked out a warning:--"
2273,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"‘Is it war you want, for slaughtered goats and bullocks,"
2274,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Is it war you bring, you sons of liars, driving"
2275,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,The innocent Harpies from their father’s kingdom?
2276,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Take notice, then, and let my words forever"
2277,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Stick in your hearts; what Jove has told Apollo,"
2278,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Apollo told me, and I, the greatest fury,"
2279,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Shove down your throats; it is Italy you are after,"
2280,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And the winds will help you, Italy and her harbors"
2281,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"You will reach, all right; but you will not wall the city"
2282,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Till, for the wrong you have done us, deadly hunger"
2283,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Will make you gnaw and crunch your very tables!’
2284,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,She flew back to the forest. My companions
2285,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Were chilled with sudden fear; their spirit wavered,"
2286,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"They call on me, to beg for peace, not now"
2287,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"With arms, but vows and praying, filthy birds"
2288,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Or ill-foreboding goddesses, no matter."
2289,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Anchises prayed with outstretched hands, appeasing"
2290,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The mighty gods with sacrifice:--‘Be gracious,"
2291,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Great gods, ward off the threats, spare the devoted!’"
2292,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"He bade us tear the cable from the shore,"
2293,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Shake loose the sails. And a wind sprang up behind us,"
2294,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Driving us northward; we passed many islands,"
2295,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Zacynthus, wooded, Dulichium, and Same,"
2296,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The cliffs of Neritus, Laertes’ kingdom,"
2297,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"With a curse as we went by for Ithaca,"
2298,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Land of Ulysses. Soon Leucate’s headland
2299,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Came into view, a dreadful place for sailors,"
2300,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Where Apollo had a shrine. We were very weary
2301,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,As we drew near the little town; the anchor
2302,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Was thrown from the prow, the sterns pulled up on the beaches."
2303,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,
2304,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,This was unhoped-for land; we offered Jove
2305,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Our purifying rites, and had the altars"
2306,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Burning with sacrifice. We thronged the shore
2307,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"With games of Ilium. Naked, oiled for wrestling,"
2308,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The young held bouts, glad that so many islands"
2309,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Held by the Greeks, were safely passed. A year"
2310,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Went by, and icy winter roughened the waves"
2311,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"With gales from the north. A shield of hollow bronze,"
2312,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Borne once by Abas, I fastened to the door-posts,"
2313,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,And set a verse below it: _Aeneas won
2314,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,These arms from the Greek victors._ I gave the order
2315,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,To man the thwarts and leave this harbor; all
2316,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Obeyed, swept oars in rivalry. We left"
2317,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Phaeacia’s airy heights, coasting Epirus,"
2318,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Drawn to Buthrotum, a Chaonian harbor."
2319,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,
2320,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And here we met strange news, that Helenus,"
2321,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The son of Priam, was ruling Grecian cities,"
2322,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Having won the wife of Pyrrhus and his crown,"
2323,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,And that Andromache once more had married
2324,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"A lord of her own race. Amazed, I burn"
2325,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"With a strange longing to seek out that hero,"
2326,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"To learn his great adventures. It so happened,"
2327,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Just as I left the landing, that was the day"
2328,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Andromache, in a grove before the city,"
2329,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,By the waters of a river that resembled
2330,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The Simois at home, was offering homage,"
2331,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Her annual mourning-gift to Hector’s ashes,"
2332,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Calling his ghost to the place which she had hallowed
2333,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"With double altars, a green and empty tomb."
2334,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"I found her weeping there, and she was startled"
2335,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"At the sight of me, and Trojan arms, a shock"
2336,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Too great to bear: she was rigid for a moment,"
2337,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And then lost consciousness, and a long time later"
2338,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Managed to speak: ‘Is it real, then, goddess-born?"
2339,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"What are you, living messenger or phantom,"
2340,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Mortal or ghost? If the dear light has left you,"
2341,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Tell me where Hector is.’ I was moved, so deeply"
2342,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,I found it hard to answer to her tears
2343,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And through my own, but I did say a little:--"
2344,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,‘I am alive; I seem to keep on living
2345,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Through all extremes of trouble; do not doubt me,"
2346,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,I am no apparition. And what has happened
2347,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"To you, dear wife of Hector? Could any gain"
2348,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Atone for such a loss? Has fortune tried
2349,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,To even matters at all? Does Pyrrhus still
2350,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Presume on you as husband?’ With lowered gaze
2351,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,And quiet voice she answered:--‘Happy the maiden
2352,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Slain at the foeman’s tomb, at the foot of the walls;"
2353,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Happy the daughter of Priam, who never knew"
2354,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The drawing of the lots, nor came to the bed"
2355,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Of a conqueror, his captive. After the fire"
2356,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"I travelled different seas, endured the pride"
2357,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Achilles filled his son with, bore him children"
2358,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"In bondage, till he tired of me and left me"
2359,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,For Leda’s daughter and a Spartan marriage.
2360,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"He passed me on to Helenus, fair enough,"
2361,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Slave-woman to slave-man; but then Orestes,"
2362,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Inflamed with passion for his stolen bride,"
2363,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And maddened by the Furies of his vengeance,"
2364,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Caught Pyrrhus off-guard, and slew him at the altar"
2365,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"In his ancestral home. And Pyrrhus dying,"
2366,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Part of the kingdom came to Helenus,"
2367,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Who named the fields Chaonian, the land"
2368,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Chaonia, after a man from Troy,"
2369,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And filled the heights, as best he could, with buildings"
2370,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,To look like those we knew. But what of yourself?
2371,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"What winds, what fate, have brought you here, or was it"
2372,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Some god? did you know you were on our coast? How is
2373,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The boy Ascanius, living still, whom Troy"
2374,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Might have--does he ever think about his mother?
2375,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Does he want to be a hero, a manly spirit,"
2376,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Such as his father was, and his uncle Hector?’"
2377,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"She was in tears again, when the son of Priam,"
2378,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Helenus, with an escort, came from the city,"
2379,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Happy to recognize us, bringing us in"
2380,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"With tears and greeting mingled. I went on,"
2381,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Seeing a little Troy, low walls that copied"
2382,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The old majestic ramparts, a tiny river"
2383,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"In a dry bed, trying to be the Xanthus,"
2384,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"I found the Scaean gates, to hold and cling to."
2385,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"My Trojans, too, were fond of the friendly town,"
2386,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Whose king received them in wide halls; libations
2387,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Were poured to the gods, and feasts set on gold dishes."
2388,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,
2389,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Day after day went by, and the winds were calling"
2390,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,And the sails filling with a good south-wester.
2391,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,I put my questions to the king and prophet:
2392,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"‘O son of Troy, the god’s interpreter,"
2393,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Familiar with the tripod and the laurel
2394,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Of great Apollo, versed in stars and omens,"
2395,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Bird-song and flying wing, be gracious to me,"
2396,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Tell me,--for Heaven has prophesied a journey"
2397,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Without mischance, and all the gods have sent me"
2398,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The counsel of their oracles, to follow"
2399,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Italy and a far-off country; one,"
2400,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"But one, Celaeno, prophesied misfortune,"
2401,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Wrath and revolting hunger,--tell me, prophet,"
2402,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"What dangers first to avoid, what presence follow"
2403,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,To overcome disaster?’
2404,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,
2405,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Bullocks slain
2406,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"With proper covenant, and the chaplets loosened,"
2407,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"He led me to the temple of Apollo,"
2408,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The very gates, where the god’s presence awed me,"
2409,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And where he spoke, with eloquent inspiration:--"
2410,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"‘O goddess-born, the journey over the sea"
2411,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Holds a clear sanction for you, under Jove,"
2412,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Who draws the lots and turns the wheel of Fate.
2413,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"I will tell you some few things, not all, that safely"
2414,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"You may go through friendly waters, and in time"
2415,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Come to Ausonian harborage; the rest
2416,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Helenus does not know, or, if he did,"
2417,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Juno would stop his speaking. First of all,"
2418,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Italy, which you think is near, too fondly"
2419,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Ready to enter her nearest port, is distant,"
2420,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Divided from you by a pathless journey
2421,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,And longer lands between. The oar must bend
2422,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"In the Sicilian ocean, and the ships"
2423,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Sail on a farther coast, beyond the lakes"
2424,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Of an infernal world, beyond the isles"
2425,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Where dwells Aeaean Circe, not till then"
2426,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Can the built city rise on friendly ground.
2427,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Keep in the mind the sign I give you now:
2428,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"One day, when you are anxious and alone"
2429,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"At the wave of a hidden river, you will find"
2430,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Under the oaks on the shore, a sow, a white one,"
2431,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Immense, with a new-born litter, thirty young"
2432,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"At the old one’s udders; that will be the place,"
2433,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The site of the city, the certain rest from labor."
2434,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And do not fear the eating of the tables,"
2435,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The fates will find a way, Apollo answer."
2436,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Avoid this coast of Italy, the lands"
2437,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Just westward of our own; behind those walls
2438,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Dwell evil Greeks, Narycian Locri, soldiers"
2439,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Of the Cretan king, Idomeneus; the plains"
2440,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Are full of them; a Meliboean captain
2441,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Governs Petelia, a tiny town"
2442,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Relying on her fortress! Philoctetes
2443,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Commands her walls. And furthermore, remember,"
2444,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Even when the ships have crossed the sea and anchored,"
2445,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"When the altars stand on the shore, and the vows are paid,"
2446,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Keep the hair veiled, and the robe of crimson drawn"
2447,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Across the eyes, so that no hostile visage"
2448,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"May interfere, to gaze on the holy fire"
2449,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Or spoil the sacred omens. This rite observe
2450,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Through all the generations; keep it holy.
2451,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"From that first landing, when the wind brings you down"
2452,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"To Sicily’s coast, and narrow Pelorus widens"
2453,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The waters of her strait, keep to the left,"
2454,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Land on the left, and water on the left,"
2455,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,The long way round; the right is dangerous.
2456,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Avoid it. There’s a story that this land
2457,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Once broke apart--(time brings so many changes)--
2458,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"By some immense convulsion, though the lands"
2459,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Had been one country once. But now between them
2460,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The sea comes in, and now the waters bound"
2461,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Italian coast, Sicilian coast; the tide"
2462,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Washes on severed shores, their fields, their cities."
2463,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Scylla keeps guard on the right; on the left Charybdis,"
2464,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,The unappeasable; from the deep gulf she sucks
2465,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The great waves down, three times; three times she belches"
2466,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Them high up into the air, and sprays the stars."
2467,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Scylla is held in a cave, a den of darkness,"
2468,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"From where she thrusts her huge jaws out, and draws"
2469,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Ships to her jagged rocks. She looks like a girl
2470,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Fair-breasted to the waist, from there, all monster,"
2471,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Shapeless, with dolphins’ tails, and a wolf’s belly."
2472,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Better to go the long way round, make turning"
2473,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Beyond Pachynus, than to catch one glimpse"
2474,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Of Scylla the misshapen, in her cavern,"
2475,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,And the rocks resounding with the dark-blue sea-hounds.
2476,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And one thing more than any, goddess-born,"
2477,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"I tell you over and over: pray to Juno,"
2478,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Give Juno vows and gifts and overcome her
2479,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,With everlasting worship. So you will come
2480,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Past Sicily and reach Italian beaches.
2481,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"You will come to a town called Cumae, haunted lakes,"
2482,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And a forest called Avernus, where the leaves"
2483,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Rustle and stir in the great woods, and there"
2484,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"You will find a priestess, in her wildness singing"
2485,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Prophetic verses under the stones, and keeping"
2486,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Symbols and signs on leaves. She files and stores them
2487,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"In the depth of the cave; there they remain unmoving,"
2488,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Keeping their order, but if a light wind stirs"
2489,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"At the turn of a hinge, and the door’s draft disturbs them,"
2490,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,The priestess never cares to catch them fluttering
2491,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Around the halls of rock, put them in order,"
2492,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Or give them rearrangement. Men who have come there
2493,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"For guidance leave uncounselled, and they hate"
2494,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The Sibyl’s dwelling. Let no loss of time,"
2495,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"However comrades chide and chafe, however"
2496,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The wind’s voice calls the sail, postpone the visit"
2497,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,To this great priestess; plead with her to tell you
2498,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,With her own lips the song of the oracles.
2499,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"She will predict the wars to come, the nations"
2500,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Of Italy, the toils to face, or flee from;"
2501,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Meet her with reverence, and she, propitious,"
2502,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Will grant a happy course. My voice can tell you
2503,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,No more than this. Farewell; raise Troy to heaven.’
2504,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,
2505,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"After the friendly counsel, other gifts"
2506,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Were sent to our ships, carved ivory, and gold,"
2507,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And heavy silver, cauldrons from Dodona,"
2508,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"A triple breastplate linked with gold, a helmet"
2509,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Shining with crested plume, the arms of Pyrrhus."
2510,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"My father, too, has gifts; horses and guides"
2511,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Are added, and sailing-men, and arms for my comrades."
2512,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Anchises bade the fleet prepare; the wind
2513,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Was rising, why delay? But Helenus"
2514,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Spoke to Anchises, in compliment and honor:--"
2515,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"‘Anchises, worthy of Venus’ couch, and the blessing"
2516,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Of other gods, twice saved from Trojan ruins,"
2517,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Yonder behold Ausonia! Near, and far,"
2518,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"It lies, Apollo’s offering; sail westward."
2519,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Farewell, made blest by a son’s goodness. I"
2520,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Am a nuisance with my talking.’
2521,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,
2522,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And his queen,"
2523,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Sad at the final parting, was bringing gifts,"
2524,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Robes woven with a golden thread, a Trojan"
2525,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Scarf for Ascanius, all courteous honor"
2526,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Given with these:--‘Take them, my child; these are"
2527,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The work of my own hands, memorials"
2528,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Of Hector’s wife Andromache, and her love."
2529,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Receive these farewell gifts; they are for one
2530,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Who brings my own son back to me; your hands,"
2531,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Your face, your eyes, remind me of him so,--"
2532,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,He would be just your age.’
2533,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,
2534,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"I, also, wept,"
2535,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,As I spoke my words of parting: ‘Now farewell;
2536,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Your lot is finished, and your rest is won,"
2537,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"No ocean fields to plough, no fleeing fields"
2538,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"To follow, you have your Xanthus and your Troy,"
2539,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Built by your hands, and blest by happier omens,"
2540,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Far from the path of the Greeks. But we are called
2541,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,From fate to fate; if ever I enter Tiber
2542,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And Tiber’s neighboring lands, if ever I see"
2543,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The walls vouchsafed my people, I pray these shores,"
2544,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Italy and Epirus, shall be one,"
2545,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The life of Troy restored, with friendly towns"
2546,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And allied people. A common origin,"
2547,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"A common fall, was ours. Let us remember,"
2548,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,And our children keep the faith.’
2549,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,
2550,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Over the sea we rode, the shortest run"
2551,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"To Italy, past the Ceraunian rocks."
2552,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,The sun went down; the hills were dark with shadow.
2553,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The oars assigned, we drew in to the land"
2554,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"For a little welcome rest; sleep overcame us,"
2555,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,But it was not yet midnight when our pilot
2556,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Sprang from his blanket, studying the winds,"
2557,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Alert and listening, noting the stars"
2558,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Wheeling the silent heaven, the twin Oxen,"
2559,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Arcturus and the rainy Kids. All calm,"
2560,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"He saw, and roused us; camp was broken; the sail"
2561,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Spread to the rushing breeze, and as day reddened"
2562,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And the stars faded, we saw a coast, low-lying,"
2563,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And made out hills. ‘Italy!’, cried Achates,"
2564,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,‘Italy!’ all the happy sailors shouted.
2565,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Anchises wreathed a royal wine-bowl, stood"
2566,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"On the high stern, calling:--‘Gods of earth and ocean"
2567,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And wind and storm, help us along, propitious"
2568,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"With favoring breath!’ And the breeze sprang up, and freshened;"
2569,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"We saw a harbor open, and a temple"
2570,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Shone on Minerva’s headland. The sails came down,"
2571,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,We headed toward the land. Like the curve of a bow
2572,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,The port turned in from the Eastern waves; its cliffs
2573,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Foamed with the salty spray, and towering rocks"
2574,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Came down to the sea, on both sides, double walls,"
2575,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And the temple fled the shore. Here, our first omen,"
2576,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"I saw four horses grazing, white as snow,"
2577,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And father Anchises cried:--‘It is war you bring us,"
2578,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Welcoming land, horses are armed for war,"
2579,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,It is war these herds portend. But there is hope
2580,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Of peace as well. Horses will bend to the yoke
2581,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,And bear the bridle tamely.’ Then we worshipped
2582,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The holy power of Pallas, first to hear us,"
2583,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Kept our heads veiled before the solemn altar,"
2584,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And following Helenus’ injunction, offered"
2585,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Our deepest prayer to Juno.
2586,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,
2587,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And sailed on,"
2588,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"With some misgiving, past the homes of Greeks;"
2589,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Saw, next, a bay, Tarentum, and a town"
2590,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"That rumor said was Hercules’; against it,"
2591,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The towers of Caulon rose, and Scylaceum,"
2592,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Most dangerous to ships, and a temple of Juno."
2593,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Far off, Sicilian Etna rose from the waves,"
2594,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And we heard the loud sea roar, and the rocks resounding,"
2595,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,And voices broken on the coast; the shoals
2596,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Leaped at us, and the tide boiled sand. My father"
2597,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Cried in alarm:--‘This must be that Charybdis
2598,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Helenus warned us of. Rise to the oars,"
2599,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"O comrades, pull from the danger!’ They responded"
2600,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"As they did, always, Palinurus swinging"
2601,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The prow to the waves on the left, and all our effort"
2602,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Strained to the left, with oars and sail. One moment"
2603,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"We were in the clouds, the next in the gulf of Hell;"
2604,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Three times the hollow rocks and reefs roared at us,"
2605,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Three times we saw spray shower the very stars,"
2606,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And the wind went down at sunset; we were weary,"
2607,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Drifting, in ignorance, to the Cyclops shores."
2608,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,
2609,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"There is a harbor, safe enough from wind,"
2610,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"But Etna thunders near it, crashing and roaring,"
2611,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Throwing black clouds up to the sky, and smoking"
2612,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"With swirling pitchy color, and white-hot ashes,"
2613,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"With balls of flame puffed to the stars, and boulders,"
2614,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The mountain’s guts, belched out, or molten rock"
2615,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Boiling below the ground, roaring above it."
2616,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The story goes that Enceladus, a giant,"
2617,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Struck by a bolt of lightning, lies here buried"
2618,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Beneath all Etna’s weight, with the flames pouring"
2619,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Through the broken furnace-flues; he shifts his body,"
2620,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Every so often, to rest his weariness,"
2621,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,And then all Sicily seems to moan and tremble
2622,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And fill the sky with smoke. We spent the night here,"
2623,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Hiding in woods, enduring monstrous portents,"
2624,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Unable to learn the cause. There were no stars,"
2625,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"No light or fire in the sky; the dead of the night,"
2626,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The thick of the cloud, obscured the moon."
2627,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,
2628,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,And day
2629,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Arrived, at last, and the shadows left the heaven,"
2630,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And a man came out of the woods, a sorry figure,"
2631,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"In hunger’s final stages, reaching toward us"
2632,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,His outstretched hands. We looked again. His beard
2633,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Unshorn, his rags pinned up with thorns, and dirty,"
2634,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"He was, beyond all doubt of it, a Greek,"
2635,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,And one of those who had been at Troy in the fighting.
2636,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"He saw, far off, the Trojan dress and armor,"
2637,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Stopped short, for a moment, almost started back"
2638,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"In panic, then, with a wild rush, came on,"
2639,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Pleading and crying:--‘By the stars I beg you,"
2640,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"By the gods above, the air we breathe, ah Trojans,"
2641,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Take me away from here, carry me off"
2642,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,To any land whatever; that will be plenty.
2643,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"I know I am one of the Greeks, I know I sailed"
2644,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"With them, I warred against the gods of Ilium,"
2645,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"I admit all that; drown me for evil-doing,"
2646,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Cut me to pieces, scatter me over the waves."
2647,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Kill me. If I must die, it will be a pleasure"
2648,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,To perish at the hands of men.’ He held
2649,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Our knees and clung there, grovelling before us."
2650,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"We urged him tell his story, his race, his fortune."
2651,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"My father gave him his hand, a pledge of safety,"
2652,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,And his fear died down a little.
2653,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,
2654,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"‘I come,’ he said,"
2655,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"‘From Ithaca, a companion of Ulysses;"
2656,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"My name is Achaemenides; my father,"
2657,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"His name was Adamastus, was a poor man,"
2658,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,And that was why I came to Troy. My comrades
2659,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Left me behind here, in their terrible hurry,"
2660,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,To leave these cruel thresholds. The Cyclops live here
2661,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"In a dark cave, a house of gore, and banquets"
2662,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Soaking with blood. It is dark inside there, monstrous."
2663,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"He hits the stars with his head--Dear gods, abolish"
2664,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,This creature from the world!--he is not easy
2665,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,To look at; he is terrible to talk to.
2666,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"His food is the flesh of men, his drink their blood."
2667,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"I saw him once myself, with two of our men"
2668,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,In that huge fist of his; he lay on his back
2669,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"In the midst of the cave, and smashed them on a rock,"
2670,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,And the whole place swam with blood; I watched him chew them
2671,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The limbs with black clots dripping, the muscles, warm,"
2672,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Quivering as he bit them. But we got him!
2673,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Ulysses did not stand for this; he kept
2674,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"His wits about him, never mind the danger."
2675,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The giant was gorged with food, and drunk, and lolling"
2676,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"With sagging neck, sprawling all over the cavern"
2677,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Belching and drooling blood-clots, bits of flesh,"
2678,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,And wine all mixed together. And we stood
2679,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Around him, praying, and drew lots,--we had found a stake"
2680,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And sharpened it at the end,--and so we bored"
2681,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,His big eye out; it glowered under his forehead
2682,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The size of a shield, or a sun. So we got vengeance"
2683,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"For the souls of our companions. But flee, I tell you,"
2684,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Get out of here, poor wretches, cut the cables,"
2685,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Forsake this shore. There are a hundred others
2686,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"As big as he is, and just like him, keeping"
2687,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Sheep in the caves of the rocks, a hundred others"
2688,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Wander around this coast and these high mountains.
2689,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"I have managed for three months, hiding in forests,"
2690,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"In the caves of beasts, on a rocky look-out, watching"
2691,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The Cyclops, horribly frightened at their cries"
2692,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And the tramp of their feet. I have lived on plants and berries,"
2693,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Gnawed roots and bark. I saw this fleet come in,"
2694,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And I did not care; whatever it was, I gladly"
2695,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Gave myself up. At least, I have escaped them."
2696,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Whatever death you give is more than welcome.’
2697,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And as he finished, we saw that very giant,"
2698,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The shepherd Polyphemus, looming huge"
2699,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Over his tiny flock; he was trying to find
2700,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"His way to the shore he knew, a shapeless monster,"
2701,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Lumbering, clumping, blind in the dark, with a stumble,"
2702,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,And the step held up with trunk of a pine. No comfort
2703,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"For him, except in the sheep. He reached the sand,"
2704,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Wading into the sea, and scooped up water"
2705,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"To wash the ooze of blood from the socket’s hollow,"
2706,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Grinding his teeth against the pain, and roaring,"
2707,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And striding into the water, but even so"
2708,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,The waves were hardly up to his sides. We fled
2709,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Taking on board our Greek; we cut the cable,"
2710,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Strained every nerve at the oars. He heard, and struggled"
2711,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Toward the splash of the wave, but of course he could not catch us,"
2712,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And then he howled in a rage, and the sea was frightened,"
2713,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Italy deeply shaken, and all Etna"
2714,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Rumbled in echoing terror in her caverns.
2715,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Out of the woods and the thicket of the mountains
2716,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The Cyclops came, the others, toward the harbor,"
2717,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Along the coast-line. We could see them standing
2718,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"In impotent anger, the wild eye-ball glaring,"
2719,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"A grim assortment, brothers, tall as mountains"
2720,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Where oak and cypress tower, in the groves"
2721,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Of Jove or great Diana. In our speed
2722,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And terror, we sailed anywhere, forgetting"
2723,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"What Helenus had said: Scylla, Charybdis,"
2724,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Were nothing to us then. But we remembered
2725,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"In time, and a north wind came from strait Pelorus,"
2726,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"We passed Pantagia, and the harbor-mouth"
2727,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Set in the living-rock, Thapsus, low-lying,"
2728,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,The bay called Megara: all these were places
2729,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"That Achaemenides knew well, recalling"
2730,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,The scenes of former wanderings with Ulysses.
2731,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,
2732,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,An island faces the Sicanian bay
2733,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Against Plemyrium, washed by waves; this island"
2734,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Has an old name, Ortygia. The story"
2735,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Tells of a river, Alpheus, come from Elis,"
2736,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"By a secret channel undersea, to join"
2737,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The Arethusan fountains, mingling here"
2738,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,With the Sicilian waters. Here we worshipped
2739,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The land’s great gods; went on, to pass Helorus,"
2740,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,A rich and marshy land; and then Pachynus
2741,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Where the cliffs rose sharp and high; and Camerina,"
2742,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"With firm foundation; the Geloan plains,"
2743,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And Gela, named for a river; then Acragas,"
2744,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"A towering town, high-walled, and sometime famous"
2745,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"For its breed of horses; the city of palms, Selinus;"
2746,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"The shoals of Lilybaeum, where the rocks"
2747,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Are a hidden danger; so at last we came
2748,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"To Drepanum, a harbor and a shoreline"
2749,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"That I could not rejoice in, a survivor"
2750,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Of all those storms of the sea. For here I lost
2751,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"My comforter in all my care and trouble,"
2752,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"My father Anchises. All the storms and perils,"
2753,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"All of the weariness endured, seemed nothing"
2754,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Compared with this disaster; and I had
2755,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"No warning of it; neither Helenus,"
2756,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"Though he foretold much trouble, nor Celaeno,"
2757,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"That evil harpy, prophesied this sorrow."
2758,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,There was nothing more to bear; the long roads ended
2759,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"At that unhappy goal; and when I left there,"
2760,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,Some god or other brought me to your shores.’
2761,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,
2762,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And so he told the story, a lonely man"
2763,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"To eager listeners, destiny and voyage,"
2764,THE WANDERINGS OF AENEAS,"And made an end of it here, ceased, and was quiet."

2771,AENEAS AND DIDO,AENEAS AND DIDO
2772,AENEAS AND DIDO,
2773,AENEAS AND DIDO,
2774,AENEAS AND DIDO,But the queen finds no rest. Deep in her veins
2775,AENEAS AND DIDO,The wound is fed; she burns with hidden fire.
2776,AENEAS AND DIDO,"His manhood, and the glory of his race"
2777,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Are an obsession with her, like his voice,"
2778,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Gesture and countenance. On the next morning,"
2779,AENEAS AND DIDO,"After a restless night, she sought her sister:"
2780,AENEAS AND DIDO,"“I am troubled, Anna, doubtful, terrified,"
2781,AENEAS AND DIDO,Or am I dreaming? What new guest is this
2782,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Come to our shores? How well he talks, how brave"
2783,AENEAS AND DIDO,He seems in heart and action! I suppose
2784,AENEAS AND DIDO,It must be true; he does come from the gods.
2785,AENEAS AND DIDO,Fear proves a bastard spirit. He has been
2786,AENEAS AND DIDO,So buffeted by fate. What endless wars
2787,AENEAS AND DIDO,"He told of! Sister, I must tell you something:"
2788,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Were not my mind made up, once and for all,"
2789,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Never again to marry, having been"
2790,AENEAS AND DIDO,"So lost when Sychaeus left me for the grave,"
2791,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Slain by my murderous brother at the altar,"
2792,AENEAS AND DIDO,Were I not sick forever of the torch
2793,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And bridal bed, here is the only man"
2794,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Who has moved my spirit, shaken my weak will."
2795,AENEAS AND DIDO,I might have yielded to him. I recognize
2796,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The marks of an old fire. But I pray, rather,"
2797,AENEAS AND DIDO,"That earth engulf me, lightning strike me down"
2798,AENEAS AND DIDO,To the pale shades and everlasting night
2799,AENEAS AND DIDO,Before I break the laws of decency.
2800,AENEAS AND DIDO,"My love has gone with Sychaeus; let him keep it,"
2801,AENEAS AND DIDO,Keep it with him forever in the grave.”
2802,AENEAS AND DIDO,"She ended with a burst of tears. “Dear sister,"
2803,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Dearer than life,” Anna replied, “why must you"
2804,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Grieve all your youth away in loneliness,"
2805,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Not know sweet children, or the joys of love?"
2806,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Is that what dust demands, and buried shadows?"
2807,AENEAS AND DIDO,So be it. You have kept your resolution
2808,AENEAS AND DIDO,"From Tyre to Libya, proved it by denying"
2809,AENEAS AND DIDO,Iarbas and a thousand other suitors
2810,AENEAS AND DIDO,From Africa’s rich kingdoms. Think a little.
2811,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Whose lands are these you settle in? Getulians,"
2812,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Invincible in war, the wild Numidians,"
2813,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Unfriendly Syrtes, ring us round, and a desert"
2814,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Barren with drought, and the Barcaean rangers."
2815,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Why should I mention Tyre, and wars arising"
2816,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Out of Pygmalion’s threats? And you, my sister,"
2817,AENEAS AND DIDO,Why should you fight against a pleasing passion?
2818,AENEAS AND DIDO,"I think the gods have willed it so, and Juno"
2819,AENEAS AND DIDO,Has helped to bring the Trojan ships to Carthage.
2820,AENEAS AND DIDO,"What a great city, sister, what a kingdom"
2821,AENEAS AND DIDO,"This might become, rising on such a marriage!"
2822,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Carthage and Troy together in arms, what glory"
2823,AENEAS AND DIDO,Might not be ours? Only invoke the blessing
2824,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Of the great gods, make sacrifice, be lavish"
2825,AENEAS AND DIDO,"In welcome, keep them here while the fierce winter"
2826,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Rages at sea, and cloud and sky are stormy,"
2827,AENEAS AND DIDO,And ships still wrecked and broken.”
2828,AENEAS AND DIDO,
2829,AENEAS AND DIDO,So she fanned
2830,AENEAS AND DIDO,The flame of the burning heart; the doubtful mind
2831,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Was given hope, and the sense of guilt was lessened."
2832,AENEAS AND DIDO,And first of all they go to shrine and altar
2833,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Imploring peace; they sacrifice to Ceres,"
2834,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Giver of law, to Bacchus, to Apollo,"
2835,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And most of all to Juno, in whose keeping"
2836,AENEAS AND DIDO,The bonds of marriage rest. In all her beauty
2837,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Dido lifts up the goblet, pours libation"
2838,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Between the horns of a white heifer, slowly,"
2839,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Or, slowly, moves to the rich altars, noting"
2840,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The proper gifts to mark the day, or studies"
2841,AENEAS AND DIDO,The sacrificial entrails for the omens.
2842,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Alas, poor blind interpreters! What woman"
2843,AENEAS AND DIDO,In love is helped by offerings or altars?
2844,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Soft fire consumes the marrow-bones, the silent"
2845,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Wound grows, deep in the heart."
2846,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Unhappy Dido burns, and wanders, burning,"
2847,AENEAS AND DIDO,"All up and down the city, the way a deer"
2848,AENEAS AND DIDO,With a hunter’s careless arrow in her flank
2849,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Ranges the uplands, with the shaft still clinging"
2850,AENEAS AND DIDO,To the hurt side. She takes Aeneas with her
2851,AENEAS AND DIDO,"All through the town, displays the wealth of Sidon,"
2852,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Buildings projected; she starts to speak, and falters,"
2853,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And at the end of the day renews the banquet,"
2854,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Is wild to hear the story, over and over,"
2855,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Hangs on each word, until the late moon, sinking,"
2856,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Sends them all home. The stars die out, but Dido"
2857,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Lies brooding in the empty hall, alone,"
2858,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Abandoned on a lonely couch. She hears him,"
2859,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Sees him, or sees and hears him in Iulus,"
2860,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Fondles the boy, as if that ruse might fool her,"
2861,AENEAS AND DIDO,Deceived by his resemblance to his father.
2862,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The towers no longer rise, the youth are slack"
2863,AENEAS AND DIDO,"In drill for arms, the cranes and derricks rusting,"
2864,AENEAS AND DIDO,Walls halt halfway to heaven.
2865,AENEAS AND DIDO,
2866,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And Juno saw it,"
2867,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The queen held fast by this disease, this passion"
2868,AENEAS AND DIDO,Which made her good name meaningless. In anger
2869,AENEAS AND DIDO,"She rushed to Venus:--“Wonderful!--the trophies,"
2870,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The praise, you and that boy of yours are winning!"
2871,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Two gods outwit one woman--splendid, splendid!"
2872,AENEAS AND DIDO,"What glory for Olympus! I know you fear me,"
2873,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Fear Carthage, and suspect us. To what purpose?"
2874,AENEAS AND DIDO,What good does all this do? Is there no limit?
2875,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Would we not both be better off, to sanction"
2876,AENEAS AND DIDO,"A bond of peace forever, a formal marriage?"
2877,AENEAS AND DIDO,You have your dearest wish; Dido is burning
2878,AENEAS AND DIDO,"With love, infected to her very marrow."
2879,AENEAS AND DIDO,Let us--why not?--conspire to rule one people
2880,AENEAS AND DIDO,On equal terms; let her serve a Trojan husband;
2881,AENEAS AND DIDO,Let her yield her Tyrian people as her dowry.”
2882,AENEAS AND DIDO,
2883,AENEAS AND DIDO,"This, Venus knew, was spoken with a purpose,"
2884,AENEAS AND DIDO,"A guileful one, to turn Italian empire"
2885,AENEAS AND DIDO,To Libyan shores: not without reservation
2886,AENEAS AND DIDO,She spoke in answer: “Who would be so foolish
2887,AENEAS AND DIDO,"As to refuse such terms, preferring warfare,"
2888,AENEAS AND DIDO,If only fortune follows that proposal?
2889,AENEAS AND DIDO,"I do not know, I am more than a little troubled"
2890,AENEAS AND DIDO,"What fate permits: will Jupiter allow it,"
2891,AENEAS AND DIDO,"One city for the Tyrians and Trojans,"
2892,AENEAS AND DIDO,"This covenant, this mixture? You can fathom"
2893,AENEAS AND DIDO,"His mind, and ask him, being his wife. I follow"
2894,AENEAS AND DIDO,Wherever you lead.” And royal Juno answered:
2895,AENEAS AND DIDO,"“That I will tend to. Listen to me, and learn"
2896,AENEAS AND DIDO,"How to achieve the urgent need. They plan,"
2897,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Aeneas, and poor Dido, to go hunting"
2898,AENEAS AND DIDO,When sunlight floods the world to-morrow morning.
2899,AENEAS AND DIDO,"While the rush of the hunt is on, and the forest shaken"
2900,AENEAS AND DIDO,"With beaters and their nets, I will pour down"
2901,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Dark rain and hail, and make the whole sky rumble"
2902,AENEAS AND DIDO,"With thunder and threat. The company will scatter,"
2903,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Hidden or hiding in the night and shadow,"
2904,AENEAS AND DIDO,And Dido and the Trojan come for shelter
2905,AENEAS AND DIDO,To the same cave. I will be there and join them
2906,AENEAS AND DIDO,"In lasting wedlock; she will be his own,"
2907,AENEAS AND DIDO,"His bride, forever; this will be their marriage.”"
2908,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Venus assented, smiling, not ungracious--"
2909,AENEAS AND DIDO,The trick was in the open.
2910,AENEAS AND DIDO,
2911,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Dawn, rising, left the ocean, and the youth"
2912,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Come forth from all the gates, prepared for hunting,"
2913,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Nets, toils, wide spears, keen-scented coursing hounds,"
2914,AENEAS AND DIDO,And Dido keeps them waiting; her own charger
2915,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Stands bright in gold and crimson; the bit foams,"
2916,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The impatient head is tossed. At last she comes,"
2917,AENEAS AND DIDO,"With a great train attending, gold and crimson,"
2918,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Quiver of gold, and combs of gold, and mantle"
2919,AENEAS AND DIDO,Crimson with golden buckle. A Trojan escort
2920,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Attends her, with Iulus, and Aeneas"
2921,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Comes to her side, more lordly than Apollo"
2922,AENEAS AND DIDO,Bright along Delos’ ridges in the springtime
2923,AENEAS AND DIDO,With laurel in his hair and golden weapons
2924,AENEAS AND DIDO,Shining across his shoulders. Equal radiance
2925,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Is all around Aeneas, equal splendor."
2926,AENEAS AND DIDO,
2927,AENEAS AND DIDO,"They reach the mountain heights, the hiding-places"
2928,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Where no trail runs; wild goats from the rocks are started,"
2929,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Run down the ridges; elsewhere, in the open"
2930,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Deer cross the dusty plain, away from the mountains."
2931,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The boy Ascanius, in the midst of the valley,"
2932,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Is glad he has so good a horse, rides, dashing"
2933,AENEAS AND DIDO,Past one group or another: deer are cowards
2934,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And wild goats tame; he prays for some excitement,"
2935,AENEAS AND DIDO,A tawny lion coming down the mountain
2936,AENEAS AND DIDO,Or a great boar with foaming mouth.
2937,AENEAS AND DIDO,
2938,AENEAS AND DIDO,The heaven
2939,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Darkens, and thunder rolls, and rain and hail"
2940,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Come down in torrents. The hunt is all for shelter,"
2941,AENEAS AND DIDO,Trojans and Tyrians and Ascanius dashing
2942,AENEAS AND DIDO,Wherever they can; the streams pour down the mountains.
2943,AENEAS AND DIDO,"To the same cave go Dido and Aeneas,"
2944,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Where Juno, as a bridesmaid, gives the signal,"
2945,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And mountain nymphs wail high their incantations,"
2946,AENEAS AND DIDO,"First day of death, first cause of evil. Dido"
2947,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Is unconcerned with fame, with reputation,"
2948,AENEAS AND DIDO,With how it seems to others. This is marriage
2949,AENEAS AND DIDO,"For her, not hole-and-corner guilt; she covers"
2950,AENEAS AND DIDO,Her folly with this name.
2951,AENEAS AND DIDO,
2952,AENEAS AND DIDO,Rumor goes flying
2953,AENEAS AND DIDO,"At once, through all the Libyan cities, Rumor"
2954,AENEAS AND DIDO,Than whom no other evil was ever swifter.
2955,AENEAS AND DIDO,She thrives on motion and her own momentum;
2956,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Tiny at first in fear, she swells, colossal"
2957,AENEAS AND DIDO,"In no time, walks on earth, but her head is hidden"
2958,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Among the clouds. Her mother, Earth, was angry,"
2959,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Once, at the gods, and out of spite produced her,"
2960,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The Titans’ youngest sister, swift of foot,"
2961,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Deadly of wing, a huge and terrible monster,"
2962,AENEAS AND DIDO,"With an eye below each feather in her body,"
2963,AENEAS AND DIDO,"A tongue, a mouth, for every eye, and ears"
2964,AENEAS AND DIDO,Double that number; in the night she flies
2965,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Above the earth, below the sky, in shadow"
2966,AENEAS AND DIDO,Noisy and shrill; her eyes are never closed
2967,AENEAS AND DIDO,"In slumber; and by day she perches, watching"
2968,AENEAS AND DIDO,"From tower or battlement, frightening great cities."
2969,AENEAS AND DIDO,"She heralds truth, and clings to lies and falsehood,"
2970,AENEAS AND DIDO,It is all the same to her. And now she was going
2971,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Happy about her business, filling people"
2972,AENEAS AND DIDO,"With truth and lies: Aeneas, Trojan-born,"
2973,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Has come, she says, and Dido, lovely woman,"
2974,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Sees fit to mate with him, one way or another,"
2975,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And now the couple wanton out the winter,"
2976,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Heedless of ruling, prisoners of passion."
2977,AENEAS AND DIDO,"They were dirty stories, but the goddess gave them"
2978,AENEAS AND DIDO,"To the common ear, then went to King Iarbas"
2979,AENEAS AND DIDO,With words that fired the fuel of his anger.
2980,AENEAS AND DIDO,
2981,AENEAS AND DIDO,"This king was Ammon’s son, a child of rape"
2982,AENEAS AND DIDO,Begotten on a nymph from Garamantia;
2983,AENEAS AND DIDO,"He owned wide kingdoms, had a hundred altars"
2984,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Blazing with fires to Jove, eternal outposts"
2985,AENEAS AND DIDO,"In the gods’ honor; the ground was fat with blood,"
2986,AENEAS AND DIDO,The temple portals blossoming with garlands.
2987,AENEAS AND DIDO,"He heard the bitter stories, and went crazy,"
2988,AENEAS AND DIDO,Before the presences of many altars
2989,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Beseeching and imploring:--“Jove Almighty,"
2990,AENEAS AND DIDO,To whom the Moorish race on colored couches
2991,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Pours festive wine, do you see these things, or are we"
2992,AENEAS AND DIDO,"A pack of idiots, shaking at the lightning"
2993,AENEAS AND DIDO,"We think you brandish, when it is really only"
2994,AENEAS AND DIDO,"An aimless flash of light, and silly noises?"
2995,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Do you see these things? A woman, who used to wander"
2996,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Around my lands, who bought a little city,"
2997,AENEAS AND DIDO,"To whom we gave some ploughland and a contract,"
2998,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Disdains me as a husband, takes Aeneas"
2999,AENEAS AND DIDO,"To be her lord and master, in her kingdom,"
3000,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And now that second Paris, with his lackeys,"
3001,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Half-men, I call them, his chin tied up with ribbons,"
3002,AENEAS AND DIDO,"With millinery on his perfumed tresses,"
3003,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Takes over what he stole, and we keep bringing"
3004,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Gifts to your temples, we, devout believers"
3005,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Forsooth, in idle legend.”"
3006,AENEAS AND DIDO,
3007,AENEAS AND DIDO,And Jove heard him
3008,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Making his prayer and clinging to the altars,"
3009,AENEAS AND DIDO,And turned his eyes to Carthage and the lovers
3010,AENEAS AND DIDO,Forgetful of their better reputation.
3011,AENEAS AND DIDO,"He summoned Mercury:--“Go forth, my son,"
3012,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Descend on wing and wind to Tyrian Carthage,"
3013,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Speak to the Trojan leader, loitering there"
3014,AENEAS AND DIDO,Unheedful of the cities given by fate.
3015,AENEAS AND DIDO,Take him my orders through the rapid winds:
3016,AENEAS AND DIDO,It was not for this his lovely mother saved him
3017,AENEAS AND DIDO,Twice from Greek arms; she promised he would be
3018,AENEAS AND DIDO,"A ruler, in a country loud with war,"
3019,AENEAS AND DIDO,Pregnant with empire; he would sire a race
3020,AENEAS AND DIDO,From Teucer’s noble line; he would ordain
3021,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Law for the world. If no such glory moves him,"
3022,AENEAS AND DIDO,"If his own fame and fortune count as nothing,"
3023,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Does he, a father, grudge his son the towers"
3024,AENEAS AND DIDO,Of Rome to be? What is the fellow doing?
3025,AENEAS AND DIDO,With what ambition wasting time in Libya?
3026,AENEAS AND DIDO,Let him set sail. That’s all; convey the message.”
3027,AENEAS AND DIDO,
3028,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Before he ended, Mercury made ready"
3029,AENEAS AND DIDO,To carry out the orders of his father;
3030,AENEAS AND DIDO,"He strapped the golden sandals on, the pinions"
3031,AENEAS AND DIDO,"To bear him over sea and land, as swift"
3032,AENEAS AND DIDO,"As the breath of the wind; he took the wand, which summons"
3033,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Pale ghosts from Hell, or sends them there, denying"
3034,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Or giving sleep, unsealing dead men’s eyes,"
3035,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Useful in flight through wind and stormy cloud,"
3036,AENEAS AND DIDO,And so came flying till he saw the summit
3037,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And towering sides of Atlas, rugged giant"
3038,AENEAS AND DIDO,"With heaven on his neck, whose head and shoulders"
3039,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Are dark with fir, ringed with black cloud, and beaten"
3040,AENEAS AND DIDO,"With wind and rain, and laden with the whiteness"
3041,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Of falling snow, with rivers running over"
3042,AENEAS AND DIDO,"His agèd chin, and the rough beard ice-stiffened."
3043,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Here first on level wing the god paused briefly,"
3044,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Poised, plummeted to ocean, like a bird"
3045,AENEAS AND DIDO,"That skims the water’s surface, flying low"
3046,AENEAS AND DIDO,"By shore and fishes’ rocky breeding-ground,"
3047,AENEAS AND DIDO,So Mercury darted between earth and heaven
3048,AENEAS AND DIDO,"To Libya’s sandy shore, cutting the wind"
3049,AENEAS AND DIDO,From the home of Maia’s father.
3050,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Soon as the winged sandals skim the rooftops,"
3051,AENEAS AND DIDO,"He sees Aeneas founding towers, building"
3052,AENEAS AND DIDO,New homes for Tyrians; his sword is studded
3053,AENEAS AND DIDO,With yellow jasper; he wears across his shoulders
3054,AENEAS AND DIDO,"A cloak of burning crimson, and golden threads"
3055,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Run through it, the royal gift of the rich queen."
3056,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Mercury wastes no time:--“What are you doing,"
3057,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Forgetful of your kingdom and your fortunes,"
3058,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Building for Carthage? Woman-crazy fellow,"
3059,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The ruler of the gods, the great compeller"
3060,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Of heaven and earth, has sent me from Olympus"
3061,AENEAS AND DIDO,"With no more word than this: what are you doing,"
3062,AENEAS AND DIDO,With what ambition wasting time in Libya?
3063,AENEAS AND DIDO,"If your own fame and fortune count as nothing,"
3064,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Think of Ascanius at least, whose kingdom"
3065,AENEAS AND DIDO,"In Italy, whose Roman land, are waiting"
3066,AENEAS AND DIDO,"As promise justly due.” He spoke, and vanished"
3067,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Into thin air. Apalled, amazed, Aeneas"
3068,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Is stricken dumb; his hair stands up in terror,"
3069,AENEAS AND DIDO,His voice sticks in his throat. He is more than eager
3070,AENEAS AND DIDO,"To flee that pleasant land, awed by the warning"
3071,AENEAS AND DIDO,Of the divine command. But how to do it?
3072,AENEAS AND DIDO,How get around that passionate queen? What opening
3073,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Try first? His mind runs out in all directions,"
3074,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Shifting and veering. Finally, he has it,"
3075,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Or thinks he has: he calls his comrades to him,"
3076,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The leaders, bids them quietly prepare"
3077,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The fleet for voyage, meanwhile saying nothing"
3078,AENEAS AND DIDO,About the new activity; since Dido
3079,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Is unaware, has no idea that passion"
3080,AENEAS AND DIDO,"As strong as theirs is on the verge of breaking,"
3081,AENEAS AND DIDO,"He will see what he can do, find the right moment"
3082,AENEAS AND DIDO,"To let her know, all in good time. Rejoicing,"
3083,AENEAS AND DIDO,The captains move to carry out the orders.
3084,AENEAS AND DIDO,
3085,AENEAS AND DIDO,Who can deceive a woman in love? The queen
3086,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Anticipates each move, is fearful even"
3087,AENEAS AND DIDO,"While everything is safe, foresees this cunning,"
3088,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And the same trouble-making goddess, Rumor,"
3089,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Tells her the fleet is being armed, made ready"
3090,AENEAS AND DIDO,For voyaging. She rages through the city
3091,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Like a woman mad, or drunk, the way the Maenads"
3092,AENEAS AND DIDO,Go howling through the night-time on Cithaeron
3093,AENEAS AND DIDO,When Bacchus’ cymbals summon with their clashing.
3094,AENEAS AND DIDO,She waits no explanation from Aeneas;
3095,AENEAS AND DIDO,"She is the first to speak: “And so, betrayer,"
3096,AENEAS AND DIDO,"You hoped to hide your wickedness, go sneaking"
3097,AENEAS AND DIDO,Out of my land without a word? Our love
3098,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Means nothing to you, our exchange of vows,"
3099,AENEAS AND DIDO,And even the death of Dido could not hold you.
3100,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The season is dead of winter, and you labor"
3101,AENEAS AND DIDO,Over the fleet; the northern gales are nothing--
3102,AENEAS AND DIDO,"You must be cruel, must you not? Why, even,"
3103,AENEAS AND DIDO,"If ancient Troy remained, and you were seeking"
3104,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Not unknown homes and lands, but Troy again,"
3105,AENEAS AND DIDO,Would you be venturing Troyward in this weather?
3106,AENEAS AND DIDO,I am the one you flee from: true? I beg you
3107,AENEAS AND DIDO,"By my own tears, and your right hand--(I have nothing"
3108,AENEAS AND DIDO,Else left my wretchedness)--by the beginnings
3109,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Of marriage, wedlock, what we had, if ever"
3110,AENEAS AND DIDO,"I served you well, if anything of mine"
3111,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Was ever sweet to you, I beg you, pity"
3112,AENEAS AND DIDO,A falling house; if there is room for pleading
3113,AENEAS AND DIDO,"As late as this, I plead, put off that purpose."
3114,AENEAS AND DIDO,"You are the reason I am hated; Libyans,"
3115,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Numidians, Tyrians, hate me; and my honor"
3116,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Is lost, and the fame I had, that almost brought me"
3117,AENEAS AND DIDO,"High as the stars, is gone. To whom, O guest--"
3118,AENEAS AND DIDO,I must not call you husband any longer--
3119,AENEAS AND DIDO,To whom do you leave me? I am a dying woman;
3120,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Why do I linger on? Until Pygmalion,"
3121,AENEAS AND DIDO,"My brother, brings destruction to this city?"
3122,AENEAS AND DIDO,Until the prince Iarbas leads me captive?
3123,AENEAS AND DIDO,At least if there had been some hope of children
3124,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Before your flight, a little Aeneas playing"
3125,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Around my courts, to bring you back, in feature"
3126,AENEAS AND DIDO,"At least, I would seem less taken and deserted.”"
3127,AENEAS AND DIDO,
3128,AENEAS AND DIDO,There was nothing he could say. Jove bade him keep
3129,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Affection from his eyes, and grief in his heart"
3130,AENEAS AND DIDO,"With never a sign. At last, he managed something:--"
3131,AENEAS AND DIDO,"“Never, O Queen, will I deny you merit"
3132,AENEAS AND DIDO,Whatever you have strength to claim; I will not
3133,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Regret remembering Dido, while I have"
3134,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Breath in my body, or consciousness of spirit."
3135,AENEAS AND DIDO,"I have a point or two to make. I did not,"
3136,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Believe me, hope to hide my flight by cunning;"
3137,AENEAS AND DIDO,"I did not, ever, claim to be a husband,"
3138,AENEAS AND DIDO,Made no such vows. If I had fate’s permission
3139,AENEAS AND DIDO,"To live my life my way, to settle my troubles"
3140,AENEAS AND DIDO,"At my own will, I would be watching over"
3141,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The city of Troy, and caring for my people,"
3142,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Those whom the Greeks had spared, and Priam’s palace"
3143,AENEAS AND DIDO,Would still be standing; for the vanquished people
3144,AENEAS AND DIDO,I would have built the town again. But now
3145,AENEAS AND DIDO,"It is Italy I must seek, great Italy,"
3146,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Apollo orders, and his oracles"
3147,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Call me to Italy. There is my love,"
3148,AENEAS AND DIDO,"There is my country. If the towers of Carthage,"
3149,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The Libyan citadels, can please a woman"
3150,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Who came from Tyre, why must you grudge the Trojans"
3151,AENEAS AND DIDO,Ausonian land? It is proper for us also
3152,AENEAS AND DIDO,To seek a foreign kingdom. I am warned
3153,AENEAS AND DIDO,Of this in dreams: when the earth is veiled in shadow
3154,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And the fiery stars are burning, I see my father,"
3155,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Anchises, or his ghost, and I am frightened;"
3156,AENEAS AND DIDO,"I am troubled for the wrong I do my son,"
3157,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Cheating him out of his kingdom in the west,"
3158,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And lands that fate assigns him. And a herald,"
3159,AENEAS AND DIDO,Jove’s messenger--I call them both to witness--
3160,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Has brought me, through the rush of air, his orders;"
3161,AENEAS AND DIDO,"I saw the god myself, in the full daylight,"
3162,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Enter these walls, I heard the words he brought me."
3163,AENEAS AND DIDO,Cease to inflame us both with your complainings;
3164,AENEAS AND DIDO,I follow Italy not because I want to.”
3165,AENEAS AND DIDO,
3166,AENEAS AND DIDO,Out of the corner of her eye she watched him
3167,AENEAS AND DIDO,"During the first of this, and her gaze was turning"
3168,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Now here, now there; and then, in bitter silence,"
3169,AENEAS AND DIDO,She looked him up and down; then blazed out at him:--
3170,AENEAS AND DIDO,"“You treacherous liar! No goddess was your mother,"
3171,AENEAS AND DIDO,"No Dardanus the founder of your tribe,"
3172,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Son of the stony mountain-crags, begotten"
3173,AENEAS AND DIDO,"On cruel rocks, with a tigress for a wet-nurse!"
3174,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Why fool myself, why make pretense? what is there"
3175,AENEAS AND DIDO,To save myself for now? When I was weeping
3176,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Did he so much as sigh? Did he turn his eyes,"
3177,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Ever so little, toward me? Did he break at all,"
3178,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Or weep, or give his lover a word of pity?"
3179,AENEAS AND DIDO,"What first, what next? Neither Jupiter nor Juno"
3180,AENEAS AND DIDO,Looks at these things with any sense of fairness.
3181,AENEAS AND DIDO,Faith has no haven anywhere in the world.
3182,AENEAS AND DIDO,"He was an outcast on my shore, a beggar,"
3183,AENEAS AND DIDO,"I took him in, and, like a fool, I gave him"
3184,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Part of my kingdom; his fleet was lost, I found it,"
3185,AENEAS AND DIDO,"His comrades dying, I brought them back to life."
3186,AENEAS AND DIDO,"I am maddened, burning, burning: now Apollo"
3187,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The prophesying god, the oracles"
3188,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Of Lycia, and Jove’s herald, sent from heaven,"
3189,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Come flying through the air with fearful orders,--"
3190,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Fine business for the gods, the kind of trouble"
3191,AENEAS AND DIDO,"That keeps them from their sleep. I do not hold you,"
3192,AENEAS AND DIDO,"I do not argue, either. Go. And follow"
3193,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Italy on the wind, and seek the kingdom"
3194,AENEAS AND DIDO,Across the water. But if any gods
3195,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Who care for decency have any power,"
3196,AENEAS AND DIDO,"They will land you on the rocks; I hope for vengeance,"
3197,AENEAS AND DIDO,I hope to hear you calling the name of Dido
3198,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Over and over, in vain. Oh, I will follow"
3199,AENEAS AND DIDO,"In blackest fire, and when cold death has taken"
3200,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Spirit from body, I will be there to haunt you,"
3201,AENEAS AND DIDO,"A shade, all over the world. I will have vengeance,"
3202,AENEAS AND DIDO,And hear about it; the news will be my comfort
3203,AENEAS AND DIDO,"In the deep world below.” She broke it off,"
3204,AENEAS AND DIDO,Leaving the words unfinished; even light
3205,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Was unendurable; sick at heart, she turned"
3206,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And left him, stammering, afraid, attempting"
3207,AENEAS AND DIDO,To make some kind of answer. And her servants
3208,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Support her to her room, that bower of marble,"
3209,AENEAS AND DIDO,"A marriage-chamber once; here they attend her,"
3210,AENEAS AND DIDO,Help her lie down.
3211,AENEAS AND DIDO,
3212,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And good Aeneas, longing"
3213,AENEAS AND DIDO,"To ease her grief with comfort, to say something"
3214,AENEAS AND DIDO,"To turn her pain and hurt away, sighs often,"
3215,AENEAS AND DIDO,"His heart being moved by this great love, most deeply,"
3216,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And still--the gods give orders, he obeys them;"
3217,AENEAS AND DIDO,He goes back to the fleet. And then the Trojans
3218,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Bend, really, to their work, launching the vessels"
3219,AENEAS AND DIDO,"All down the shore. The tarred keel swims in the water,"
3220,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The green wood comes from the forest, the poles are lopped"
3221,AENEAS AND DIDO,"For oars, with leaves still on them. All are eager"
3222,AENEAS AND DIDO,"For flight; all over the city you see them streaming,"
3223,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Bustling about their business, a black line moving"
3224,AENEAS AND DIDO,The way ants do when they remember winter
3225,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And raid a hill of grain, to haul and store it"
3226,AENEAS AND DIDO,"At home, across the plain, the column moving"
3227,AENEAS AND DIDO,"In thin black line through grass, part of them shoving"
3228,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Great seeds on little shoulders, and part bossing"
3229,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The job, rebuking laggards, and all the pathway"
3230,AENEAS AND DIDO,Hot with the stream of work.
3231,AENEAS AND DIDO,
3232,AENEAS AND DIDO,And Dido saw them
3233,AENEAS AND DIDO,With who knows what emotion: there she stood
3234,AENEAS AND DIDO,"On the high citadel, and saw, below her,"
3235,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The whole beach boiling, and the water littered"
3236,AENEAS AND DIDO,"With one ship after another, and men yelling,"
3237,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Excited over their work, and there was nothing"
3238,AENEAS AND DIDO,For her to do but sob or choke with anguish.
3239,AENEAS AND DIDO,There is nothing to which the hearts of men and women
3240,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Cannot be driven by love. Break into tears,"
3241,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Try prayers again, humble the pride, leave nothing"
3242,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Untried, and die in vain:--“Anna, you see them"
3243,AENEAS AND DIDO,Coming from everywhere; they push and bustle
3244,AENEAS AND DIDO,"All up and down the shore: the sails are swelling,"
3245,AENEAS AND DIDO,The happy sailors garlanding the vessels.
3246,AENEAS AND DIDO,"If I could hope for grief like this, my sister,"
3247,AENEAS AND DIDO,I shall be able to bear it. But one service
3248,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Do for me first, dear Anna, out of pity."
3249,AENEAS AND DIDO,"You were the only one that traitor trusted,"
3250,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Confided in; you know the way to reach him,"
3251,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The proper time and place. Give him this message,"
3252,AENEAS AND DIDO,Our arrogant enemy: tell him I never
3253,AENEAS AND DIDO,Swore with the Greeks at Aulis to abolish
3254,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The Trojan race, I never sent a fleet"
3255,AENEAS AND DIDO,"To Pergamus, I never desecrated"
3256,AENEAS AND DIDO,The ashes or the spirit of Anchises:
3257,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Why does he, then, refuse to listen to me?"
3258,AENEAS AND DIDO,What is the hurry? Let him give his lover
3259,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The one last favor: only wait a little,"
3260,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Only a little while, for better weather"
3261,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And easy flight. He has betrayed the marriage,"
3262,AENEAS AND DIDO,I do not ask for that again; I do not
3263,AENEAS AND DIDO,Ask him to give up Latium and his kingdom.
3264,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Mere time is all I am asking, a breathing-space,"
3265,AENEAS AND DIDO,"A brief reprieve, until my luck has taught me"
3266,AENEAS AND DIDO,To reconcile defeat and sorrow. This
3267,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Is all I ask for, sister; pity and help me:"
3268,AENEAS AND DIDO,"If he grants me this, I will pay it ten times over"
3269,AENEAS AND DIDO,"After my death.” And Anna, most unhappy,"
3270,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Over and over, told her tears, her pleading;"
3271,AENEAS AND DIDO,"No tears, no pleading, move him; no man can yield"
3272,AENEAS AND DIDO,When a god stops his ears. As northern winds
3273,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Sweep over Alpine mountains, in their fury"
3274,AENEAS AND DIDO,Fighting each other to uproot an oak-tree
3275,AENEAS AND DIDO,Whose ancient strength endures against their roaring
3276,AENEAS AND DIDO,And the trunk shudders and the leaves come down
3277,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Strewing the ground, but the old tree clings to the mountain,"
3278,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Its roots as deep toward hell as its crest toward heaven,"
3279,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And still holds on--even so, Aeneas, shaken"
3280,AENEAS AND DIDO,"By storm-blasts of appeal, by voices calling"
3281,AENEAS AND DIDO,"From every side, is tossed and torn, and steady."
3282,AENEAS AND DIDO,"His will stays motionless, and tears are vain."
3283,AENEAS AND DIDO,
3284,AENEAS AND DIDO,Then Dido prays for death at last; the fates
3285,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Are terrible, her luck is out, she is tired"
3286,AENEAS AND DIDO,Of gazing at the everlasting heaven.
3287,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The more to goad her will to die, she sees--"
3288,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Oh terrible!--the holy water blacken,"
3289,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Libations turn to blood, on ground and altar,"
3290,AENEAS AND DIDO,"When she makes offerings. But she tells no one,"
3291,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Not even her sister. From the marble shrine,"
3292,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Memorial to her former lord, attended,"
3293,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Always, by her, with honor, fleece and garland,"
3294,AENEAS AND DIDO,"She hears his voice, his words, her husband calling"
3295,AENEAS AND DIDO,"When darkness holds the world, and from the house-top"
3296,AENEAS AND DIDO,"An owl sends out a long funereal wailing,"
3297,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And she remembers warnings of old seers,"
3298,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Fearful, foreboding. In her dreams Aeneas"
3299,AENEAS AND DIDO,Appears to hunt her down; or she is going
3300,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Alone in a lost country, wandering"
3301,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Trying to find her Tyrians, mad as Pentheus,"
3302,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Or frenzied as Orestes, when his mother"
3303,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Is after him with whips of snakes, or firebrands,"
3304,AENEAS AND DIDO,While the Avengers menace at the threshold.
3305,AENEAS AND DIDO,
3306,AENEAS AND DIDO,"She was beaten, harboring madness, and resolved"
3307,AENEAS AND DIDO,"On dying; alone, she plotted time and method;"
3308,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Keeping the knowledge from her sorrowing sister,"
3309,AENEAS AND DIDO,She spoke with calm composure:--“I have found
3310,AENEAS AND DIDO,A way (wish me good luck) to bring him to me
3311,AENEAS AND DIDO,Or set me free from loving him forever.
3312,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Near Ocean and the west there is a country,"
3313,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The Ethiopian land, far-off, where Atlas"
3314,AENEAS AND DIDO,Turns on his shoulders the star-studded world;
3315,AENEAS AND DIDO,I know a priestess there; she guards the temple
3316,AENEAS AND DIDO,Of the daughters of the Evening Star; she feeds
3317,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The dragon there, and guards the sacred branches,"
3318,AENEAS AND DIDO,"She sprinkles honey-dew, strews drowsy poppies,"
3319,AENEAS AND DIDO,And she knows charms to free the hearts of lovers
3320,AENEAS AND DIDO,"When she so wills it, or to trouble others;"
3321,AENEAS AND DIDO,"She can reverse the wheeling of the planets,"
3322,AENEAS AND DIDO,Halt rivers in their flowing; she can summon
3323,AENEAS AND DIDO,The ghosts of night-time; you will see earth shaking
3324,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Under her tread, and trees come down from mountains."
3325,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Dear sister mine, as heaven is my witness,"
3326,AENEAS AND DIDO,I hate to take these arts of magic on me!
3327,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Be secret, then; but in the inner courtyard,"
3328,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Raise up a funeral-pyre, to hold the armor"
3329,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Left hanging in the bower, by that hero,"
3330,AENEAS AND DIDO,"That good devoted man, and all his raiment,"
3331,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And add the bridal bed, my doom: the priestess"
3332,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Said to do this, and it will be a pleasure"
3333,AENEAS AND DIDO,"To see the end of all of it, every token"
3334,AENEAS AND DIDO,Of that unspeakable knave.”
3335,AENEAS AND DIDO,
3336,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And so, thought Anna,"
3337,AENEAS AND DIDO,Things are no worse than when Sychaeus perished.
3338,AENEAS AND DIDO,"She did not know the death these rites portended,"
3339,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Had no suspicion, and carried out her orders."
3340,AENEAS AND DIDO,
3341,AENEAS AND DIDO,The pyre is raised in the court; it towers high
3342,AENEAS AND DIDO,"With pine and holm-oak, it is hung with garlands"
3343,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And funeral wreaths, and on the couch she places"
3344,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Aeneas’ sword, his garments, and his image,"
3345,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Knowing the outcome. Round about are altars,"
3346,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Where, with her hair unbound, the priestess calls"
3347,AENEAS AND DIDO,"On thrice a hundred gods, Erebus, Chaos,"
3348,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Hecate, queen of Hell, triple Diana."
3349,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Water is sprinkled, from Avernus fountain,"
3350,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Or said to be, and herbs are sought, by moonlight"
3351,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Mown with bronze sickles, and the stem-ends running"
3352,AENEAS AND DIDO,"With a black milk, and the caul of a colt, new-born."
3353,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Dido, with holy meal and holy hands,"
3354,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Stands at the altar, with one sandal loosened"
3355,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And robes unfastened, calls the gods to witness,"
3356,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Prays to the stars that know her doom, invoking,"
3357,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Beyond them, any powers, if there are any,"
3358,AENEAS AND DIDO,Who care for lovers in unequal bondage.
3359,AENEAS AND DIDO,
3360,AENEAS AND DIDO,Night: and tired creatures over all the world
3361,AENEAS AND DIDO,Were seeking slumber; the woods and the wild waters
3362,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Were quiet, and the silent stars were wheeling"
3363,AENEAS AND DIDO,Their course half over; every field was still;
3364,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The beasts of the field, the brightly colored birds,"
3365,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Dwellers in lake and pool, in thorn and thicket,"
3366,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Slept through the tranquil night, their sorrows over,"
3367,AENEAS AND DIDO,Their troubles soothed. But no such blessèd darkness
3368,AENEAS AND DIDO,Closes the eyes of Dido; no repose
3369,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Comes to her anxious heart. Her pangs redouble,"
3370,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Her love swells up, surging, a great tide rising"
3371,AENEAS AND DIDO,Of wrath and doubt and passion. “What do I do?
3372,AENEAS AND DIDO,"What now? Go back to my Numidian suitors,"
3373,AENEAS AND DIDO,Be scorned by those I scorned? Pursue the Trojans?
3374,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Obey their orders? They were grateful to me,"
3375,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Once, I remember. But who would let them take me?"
3376,AENEAS AND DIDO,Suppose I went. They hate me now; they were always
3377,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Deceivers: is Laomedon forgotten,"
3378,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Whose blood runs through their veins? What then? Attend them,"
3379,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Alone, be their companion, the loud-mouthed sailors?"
3380,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Or with my own armada follow after,"
3381,AENEAS AND DIDO,Wear out my sea-worn Tyrians once more
3382,AENEAS AND DIDO,With vengeance and adventure? Better die.
3383,AENEAS AND DIDO,Die; you deserve to; end the hurt with the sword.
3384,AENEAS AND DIDO,"It is your fault, Anna; you were sorry for me,"
3385,AENEAS AND DIDO,Won over by my tears; you put this load
3386,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Of evil on me. It was not permitted,"
3387,AENEAS AND DIDO,"It seems, for me to live apart from wedlock,"
3388,AENEAS AND DIDO,A blameless life. An animal does better.
3389,AENEAS AND DIDO,I vowed Sychaeus faith. I have been faithless.”
3390,AENEAS AND DIDO,"So, through the night, she tossed in restless torment."
3391,AENEAS AND DIDO,
3392,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Meanwhile Aeneas, on the lofty stern,"
3393,AENEAS AND DIDO,"All things prepared, sure of his going, slumbers"
3394,AENEAS AND DIDO,"As Mercury comes down once more to warn him,"
3395,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Familiar blond young god: “O son of Venus,"
3396,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Is this a time for sleep? The wind blows fair,"
3397,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And danger rises all around you. Dido,"
3398,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Certain to die, however else uncertain,"
3399,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Plots treachery, harbors evil. Seize the moment"
3400,AENEAS AND DIDO,"While it can still be seized, and hurry, hurry!"
3401,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The sea will swarm with ships, the fiery torches"
3402,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Blaze, and the shore rankle with fire by morning."
3403,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Shove off, be gone! A shifty, fickle object"
3404,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Is woman, always.” He vanished into the night."
3405,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And, frightened by that sudden apparition,"
3406,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Aeneas started from sleep, and urged his comrades:--"
3407,AENEAS AND DIDO,"“Hurry, men, hurry; get to the sails and benches,"
3408,AENEAS AND DIDO,Get the ships under way. A god from heaven
3409,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Again has come to speed our flight, to sever"
3410,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The mooring-ropes. O holy one, we follow,"
3411,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Whoever you are, we are happy in obeying."
3412,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Be with us, be propitious; let the stars"
3413,AENEAS AND DIDO,Be right in heaven!” He drew his sword; the blade
3414,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Flashed, shining, at the hawser; and all the men"
3415,AENEAS AND DIDO,Were seized in the same restlessness and rushing.
3416,AENEAS AND DIDO,"They have left the shore, they have hidden the sea-water"
3417,AENEAS AND DIDO,"With the hulls of the ships; the white foam flies, the oars"
3418,AENEAS AND DIDO,Dip down in dark-blue water.
3419,AENEAS AND DIDO,
3420,AENEAS AND DIDO,And Aurora
3421,AENEAS AND DIDO,Came from Tithonus’ saffron couch to freshen
3422,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The world with rising light, and from her watch-tower"
3423,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The queen saw day grow whiter, and the fleet"
3424,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Go moving over the sea, keep pace together"
3425,AENEAS AND DIDO,To the even spread of the sail; she knew the harbors
3426,AENEAS AND DIDO,Were empty of sailors now; she struck her breast
3427,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Three times, four times; she tore her golden hair,"
3428,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Crying, “God help me, will he go, this stranger,"
3429,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Treating our kingdom as a joke? Bring arms,"
3430,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Bring arms, and hurry! follow from all the city,"
3431,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Haul the ships off the ways, some of you! Others,"
3432,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Get fire as fast as you can, give out the weapons,"
3433,AENEAS AND DIDO,Pull oars! What am I saying? Or where am I?
3434,AENEAS AND DIDO,"I must be going mad. Unhappy Dido,"
3435,AENEAS AND DIDO,Is it only now your wickedness strikes home?
3436,AENEAS AND DIDO,The time it should have was when you gave him power.
3437,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Well, here it is, look at it now, the honor,"
3438,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The faith of the hero who, they tell me, carries"
3439,AENEAS AND DIDO,"With him his household gods, who bore on his shoulders"
3440,AENEAS AND DIDO,"His agèd father! Could I not have seized him,"
3441,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Torn him to pieces, scattered him over the waves?"
3442,AENEAS AND DIDO,What was the matter? Could I not have murdered
3443,AENEAS AND DIDO,"His comrades, and Iulus, and served the son"
3444,AENEAS AND DIDO,For a dainty at the table of his father?
3445,AENEAS AND DIDO,"But fight would have a doubtful fortune. It might have,"
3446,AENEAS AND DIDO,What then? I was going to die; whom did I fear?
3447,AENEAS AND DIDO,"I would have, should have, set his camp on fire,"
3448,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Filled everything with flame, choked off the father,"
3449,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The son, the accursèd race, and myself with them."
3450,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Great Sun, surveyor of all the works of earth,"
3451,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Juno, to whom my sorrows are committed,"
3452,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Hecate, whom the cross-roads of the cities"
3453,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Wail to by night, avenging Furies, hear me,"
3454,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Grant me divine protection, take my prayer."
3455,AENEAS AND DIDO,"If he must come to harbor, then he must,"
3456,AENEAS AND DIDO,"If Jove ordains it, however vile he is,"
3457,AENEAS AND DIDO,"False, and unspeakable. If Jove ordains,"
3458,AENEAS AND DIDO,The goal is fixed. So be it. Take my prayer.
3459,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Let him be driven by arms and war, an exile,"
3460,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Let him be taken from his son Iulus,"
3461,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Let him beg for aid, let him see his people dying"
3462,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Unworthy deaths, let him accept surrender"
3463,AENEAS AND DIDO,"On unfair terms, let him never enjoy the kingdom,"
3464,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The hoped-for light, let him fall and die, untimely,"
3465,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Let him lie unburied on the sand. Oh, hear me,"
3466,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Hear the last prayer, poured out with my last blood!"
3467,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And you, O Tyrians, hate, and hate forever"
3468,AENEAS AND DIDO,The Trojan stock. Offer my dust this homage.
3469,AENEAS AND DIDO,"No love, no peace, between these nations, ever!"
3470,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Rise from my bones, O great unknown avenger,"
3471,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Hunt them with fire and sword, the Dardan settlers,"
3472,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Now, then, here, there, wherever strength is given."
3473,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Shore against shore, wave against wave, and war,"
3474,AENEAS AND DIDO,"War after war, for all the generations.”"
3475,AENEAS AND DIDO,
3476,AENEAS AND DIDO,"She spoke, and turned her purpose to accomplish"
3477,AENEAS AND DIDO,The quickest end to the life she hated. Briefly
3478,AENEAS AND DIDO,"She spoke to Barce, Sychaeus’ nurse; her own"
3479,AENEAS AND DIDO,Was dust and ashes in her native country:--
3480,AENEAS AND DIDO,"“Dear nurse, bring me my sister, tell her to hurry,"
3481,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Tell her to sprinkle her body with river water,"
3482,AENEAS AND DIDO,"To bring the sacrificial beast and offerings,"
3483,AENEAS AND DIDO,And both of you cover your temples with holy fillets.
3484,AENEAS AND DIDO,I have a vow to keep; I have made beginning
3485,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Of rites to Stygian Jove, to end my sorrows,"
3486,AENEAS AND DIDO,To burn the litter of that Trojan leader.”
3487,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Barce, with an old woman’s fuss and bustle,"
3488,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Went hurrying out of sight; but Dido, trembling,"
3489,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Wild with her project, the blood-shot eyeballs rolling,"
3490,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Pale at the death to come, and hectic color"
3491,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Burning the quivering cheeks, broke into the court,"
3492,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Mounted the pyre in madness, drew the sword,"
3493,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The Trojan gift, bestowed for no such purpose,"
3494,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And she saw the Trojan garments, and the bed"
3495,AENEAS AND DIDO,"She knew so well, and paused a little, weeping,"
3496,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Weeping, and thinking, and flung herself down on it,"
3497,AENEAS AND DIDO,Uttering her last words:--
3498,AENEAS AND DIDO,"“Spoils that were sweet while gods and fate permitted,"
3499,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Receive my spirit, set me free from suffering."
3500,AENEAS AND DIDO,"I have lived, I have run the course that fortune gave me,"
3501,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And now my shade, a great one, will be going"
3502,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Below the earth. I have built a noble city,"
3503,AENEAS AND DIDO,"I have seen my walls, I have avenged a husband,"
3504,AENEAS AND DIDO,Punished a hostile brother. I have been
3505,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Happy, I might have been too happy, only"
3506,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The Trojans made their landing.” She broke off,"
3507,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Pressed her face to the couch, cried:--“So, we shall die,"
3508,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Die unavenged; but let us die. So, so,--"
3509,AENEAS AND DIDO,I am glad to meet the darkness. Let his eyes
3510,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Behold this fire across the sea, an omen"
3511,AENEAS AND DIDO,Of my death going with him.”
3512,AENEAS AND DIDO,
3513,AENEAS AND DIDO,"As she spoke,"
3514,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Her handmaids saw her, fallen on the sword,"
3515,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The foam of blood on the blade, and blood on the hands."
3516,AENEAS AND DIDO,"A scream rings through the house; Rumor goes reeling,"
3517,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Rioting, through the shaken town; the palace"
3518,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Is loud with lamentation, women sobbing,"
3519,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Wailing and howling, and the vaults of heaven"
3520,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Echo the outcry, as if Tyre or Carthage"
3521,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Had fallen to invaders, and the fury"
3522,AENEAS AND DIDO,Of fire came rolling over homes and temples.
3523,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Anna, half lifeless, heard in panic terror,"
3524,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Came rushing through them all, beating her bosom,"
3525,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Clawing her face:--“Was it for this, my sister?"
3526,AENEAS AND DIDO,"To trick me so? The funeral pyre, the altars,"
3527,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Prepared this for me? I have, indeed, a grievance,"
3528,AENEAS AND DIDO,Being forsaken; you would not let your sister
3529,AENEAS AND DIDO,Companion you in death? You might have called me
3530,AENEAS AND DIDO,"To the same fate; we might have both been taken,"
3531,AENEAS AND DIDO,"One sword, one hour. I was the one who built it,"
3532,AENEAS AND DIDO,"This pyre, with my own hands; it was my voice"
3533,AENEAS AND DIDO,"That called our fathers’ gods, for what?--to fail you"
3534,AENEAS AND DIDO,"When you were lying here. You have killed me, sister,"
3535,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Not only yourself, you have killed us all, the people,"
3536,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The town. Let me wash the wounds with water,"
3537,AENEAS AND DIDO,Let my lips catch what fluttering breath still lingers.”
3538,AENEAS AND DIDO,"She climbed the lofty steps, and held her sister,"
3539,AENEAS AND DIDO,"A dying woman, close; she used her robe"
3540,AENEAS AND DIDO,To try to stop the bleeding. And Dido tried
3541,AENEAS AND DIDO,"In vain to raise her heavy eyes, fell back,"
3542,AENEAS AND DIDO,And her wound made a gurgling hissing sound.
3543,AENEAS AND DIDO,Three times she tried to lift herself; three times
3544,AENEAS AND DIDO,Fell back; her rolling eyes went searching heaven
3545,AENEAS AND DIDO,"And the light hurt when she found it, and she moaned."
3546,AENEAS AND DIDO,
3547,AENEAS AND DIDO,"At last all-powerful Juno, taking pity,"
3548,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Sent Iris from Olympus, in compassion"
3549,AENEAS AND DIDO,"For the long racking agony, to free her"
3550,AENEAS AND DIDO,From the limbs’ writhing and the struggle of spirit.
3551,AENEAS AND DIDO,"She had not earned this death, she had only sought it"
3552,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Before her time, driven by sudden madness,"
3553,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Therefore, the queen of Hades had not taken"
3554,AENEAS AND DIDO,"The golden lock, consigning her to Orcus."
3555,AENEAS AND DIDO,"So Iris, dewy on saffron wings, descending,"
3556,AENEAS AND DIDO,Trailing a thousand colors through the brightness
3557,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Comes down the sky, poises above her, saying,"
3558,AENEAS AND DIDO,"“This lock I take as bidden, and from the body"
3559,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Release the soul,” and cuts the lock; and cold"
3560,AENEAS AND DIDO,"Takes over, and the winds receive the spirit."

3569,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
3570,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Meanwhile Aeneas and the fleet were holding
3571,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The sure course over the sea, cutting the waters"
3572,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,That darkened under the wind. His gaze went back
3573,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"To the walls of Carthage, glowing in the flame"
3574,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Of Dido’s funeral pyre. What cause had kindled
3575,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"So high a blaze, they did not know, but anguish"
3576,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"When love is wounded deep, and the way of a woman"
3577,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With frenzy in her heart, they knew too well,"
3578,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,And dwelt on with foreboding.
3579,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
3580,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"They were out of sight of land, with only sea"
3581,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Around them on all sides, alone with ocean,"
3582,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Ocean and sky, when a cloud, black-blue, loomed over"
3583,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,With night and tempest in it; the water roughened
3584,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"In shadow, and the pilot Palinurus"
3585,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Cried from the lofty stern. “What clouds are these
3586,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Filling the sky? What threat is father Neptune
3587,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Preparing over our heads? Trim ship,” he ordered,"
3588,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"“Bend to the oars, reef down the sail.” The course"
3589,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Was changed, on a slant across the wind, and the pilot"
3590,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Turned to Aeneas: “With a sky like this,"
3591,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"I’d have no hope of reaching Italy,"
3592,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Even if Jove himself should guarantee it.
3593,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The winds have changed, they roar across our course"
3594,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"From the black evening, thickening into cloud."
3595,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"We have no strength for headway. Luck is against us,"
3596,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Let us change the course, and follow. I remember"
3597,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Fraternal shores near by, the land of Eryx,"
3598,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Sicilian harbors; we were here before
3599,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,If I recall my stars.”
3600,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
3601,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Aeneas answered:
3602,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"“I saw it long ago, the will of the winds,"
3603,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The uselessness of struggle. Change the course,"
3604,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Steer to the land most welcome to me; there
3605,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"My friend Acestes dwells, and there my father"
3606,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Anchises lies at rest. What better land
3607,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"To rest our weary ships?” They made for the harbor,"
3608,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With favoring wind, a swift run over the water,"
3609,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,A happy turn to a familiar shore.
3610,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
3611,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"High on a hill-top look-out, king Acestes,"
3612,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Son of a Trojan mother and Crinisus,"
3613,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"A river-god, saw friendly vessels coming,"
3614,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With wonder and delight, came hurrying toward them,"
3615,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With a bear-skin over his shoulder, and javelins"
3616,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Bristling in his grasp, and he remembered"
3617,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The old relationship, and gave them welcome"
3618,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With all his rustic treasure, a glad returning,"
3619,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Friendly assurance for their weariness.
3620,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"A good night’s rest, and a bright morning followed,"
3621,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And from the shore Aeneas called his comrades,"
3622,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Stood on a little rise of ground, and told them:"
3623,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"“Great sons of Dardanus, heaven-born, a year"
3624,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Draws to an end, a year ago we buried"
3625,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"My father in this land, and consecrated"
3626,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Sorrowful altars to his shade. The day
3627,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Comes round again, which I shall always cherish,"
3628,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Always lament, with reverence, in the mourning,"
3629,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"For the gods’ will. If I were held, an exile,"
3630,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"In the Gaetulian quicksands, or a captive"
3631,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"In some Greek ship or city, I would honor"
3632,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"This day with solemn rites, and pile the altars"
3633,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With sacrificial offering. But now,--"
3634,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,This must be heaven’s purpose--we have entered
3635,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"A friendly harbor. Come, then, all of us,"
3636,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Let us be happy in our celebration,"
3637,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Let us pray for winds, and that the god hereafter"
3638,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Receive his rites in temples for his honor
3639,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Built in the city we found. Two heads of oxen
3640,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Acestes gives each vessel; bring the gods
3641,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Of our own household, and the ones Acestes"
3642,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Pays worship to. Nine days from now, if dawn"
3643,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Comes bright and shining over the world of men,"
3644,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"There will be games, a contest for the boats,"
3645,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"A foot-race, javelin-throw or archery, a battle"
3646,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With rawhide gloves; let all attend, competing"
3647,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"For victory’s palm and prize. And now, in silence,"
3648,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Garland the brow with leaves.”
3649,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
3650,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,He bound his temples
3651,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With Venus’ myrtle, and the others followed,"
3652,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Acestes, Helymus, and young Iulus,"
3653,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And the other lads, and Aeneas, from the meeting,"
3654,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Moved to Anchises’ tomb, and many thousands"
3655,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Came thronging there. He poured libation, duly,"
3656,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Bowls of pure wine, and milk, and victim-blood,"
3657,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And strewed bright flowers, praying: “Holy father,"
3658,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Hail, once again; hail once again, O ashes,"
3659,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Regained in vain; hail, holy shade and spirit!"
3660,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Hail, from a son, destined to seek alone"
3661,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The fated fields, Italian soil, alone"
3662,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"To seek, whatever it is, Ausonian Tiber.”"
3663,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And as he finished speaking, a huge serpent"
3664,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Slid over the ground, seven shining loops, surrounding"
3665,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The tomb, peacefully gliding around the altars,"
3666,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Dappled with blue and gold, such iridescence"
3667,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"As rainbow gives to cloud, when the sun strikes it."
3668,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Aeneas stood amazed; and the great serpent
3669,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Crawled to the bowls and cups, tasted the offerings,"
3670,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And slid again, without a hint of menace,"
3671,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Under the altar-stone. Intent, Aeneas"
3672,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Resumed the rites; the serpent might have been,"
3673,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"For all he knew, a guardian of the altar,"
3674,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Or some familiar spirit of Anchises.
3675,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Two sheep he sacrificed, two swine, two heifers,"
3676,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Poured wine, invoked the spirit of his father,"
3677,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,And the shade loosed from Acheron. His comrades
3678,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Also bring gifts, whatever they can, slay bullocks,"
3679,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Load altars high; others prepare the kettles,"
3680,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Sprawl on the greensward, keep the live coals glowing"
3681,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Under the roasting-spits, and the meat turning."
3682,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
3683,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And the day came, the ninth they had awaited"
3684,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With eagerness, bright and clear, and the crowd gathered"
3685,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Under Acestes’ sanction; they were eager
3686,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"To see the Trojans, or to join the contests."
3687,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"There were the prizes, tripods, and green garlands,"
3688,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And palms for the winners, armor, crimson garments,"
3689,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Talents of silver and gold. And a trumpet heralds
3690,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,The start of the games.
3691,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
3692,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,For the first contest
3693,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Four ships are entered, heavy-oared, and chosen,"
3694,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The pick of the fleet. Mnestheus is one captain,"
3695,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"His ship the _Dragon_, and his crew is eager,--"
3696,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,(Later the Memmian line will call him father).
3697,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Gyas commands the big _Chimaera_, a vessel"
3698,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Huge as a town; it takes three tiers of oarsmen
3699,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,To keep her moving. Then there is Sergestus
3700,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Riding the _Centaur_, and the sea-blue _Scylla_"
3701,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Cloanthus leads. (The Sergian house at Rome
3702,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Descends from one, Cluentians from the other.)"
3703,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
3704,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Far out in the water, facing the foaming shores,"
3705,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"There lies a rock, which the swollen waves beat over"
3706,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"On stormy days when gales blot out the stars,"
3707,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"But quiet in calm weather, a level landing"
3708,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,For the sun-loving sea-gulls. Here Aeneas
3709,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Sets a green bough of holm-oak, as a signal"
3710,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,To mark the turning-point; to this the sailors
3711,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Must row, then turn, and double back. The places"
3712,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Are chosen by lot; the captains are set off,"
3713,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Shining in gold and purple; all the sailors
3714,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Wear poplar-wreaths, and their naked shoulders glisten"
3715,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With the smear of oil. They are at their places, straining"
3716,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Arms stretched to the oars, waiting the word, and their chests"
3717,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Heave, and their hearts are pumping fast; ambition"
3718,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,And nervousness take hold of them. The signal!
3719,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"They shoot away; the noise goes up to the heavens,"
3720,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The arms pull back to the chests, the water is churned"
3721,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"To a foam like snow; the start is very even,"
3722,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,The sea gapes open under the rush of the beaks
3723,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,And the pull of the oars. The racers go no faster
3724,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"When the chariots take the field, and the barrier springs"
3725,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Cars into action, and the drivers lash"
3726,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Whipping and shaking the reins. Applause and shouting
3727,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Volley and ring, and shrill excitement rises"
3728,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,From some with bets on the issue; all the woodland
3729,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Resounds, the shores are loud, and the beaten hillside"
3730,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Sends back the uproar.
3731,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
3732,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Gyas beats the others
3733,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"In the rush of the starting sprint; Cloanthus follows,"
3734,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With a better crew, but a slower, heavier vessel;"
3735,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Behind them come the _Dragon_ and the _Centaur_,"
3736,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With no advantage either way; first one,"
3737,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And then the other, has it, moving even"
3738,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,With long keels through salt water; and the leader
3739,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Has almost reached the rock, the turn; that’s Gyas,"
3740,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The captain, yelling loudly at his pilot:--"
3741,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"“Menoetes, what the hell! Why are you steering"
3742,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"So far off to the right? Bring her in closer,"
3743,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"This way, let the oars just miss the rocks, hug shore,"
3744,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Cut her close here on the left; let the other fellows
3745,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Stay out as far as they like.” Menoetes, though,"
3746,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Feared unseen rocks, and made for open water."
3747,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"“Why so far off the course? The rock, Menoetes,"
3748,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Keep close to the rock!” And while he shouted, Gyas"
3749,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Could see Cloanthus coming up behind him
3750,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Inside him, on the left, and gaining, gaining."
3751,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Between the roar of the rock and the ship of Gyas,"
3752,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Cloanthus grazed his way, and passed the leader,"
3753,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Made the turn safely, and reached open water."
3754,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Then Gyas really was burnt up; he was crying
3755,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"In rage; to hell with pride, to hell with safety!"
3756,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"He grabbed that cautious pilot of his, and heaved him"
3757,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Over the stern, he took the rudder over,"
3758,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Steering for shore, and yelling at the sailors,"
3759,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"As old Menoetes slowly came to the surface,"
3760,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"His heavy garments dripping, clawing and scrambling"
3761,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Up to the top of the rock, to perch there, drying,"
3762,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"A good laugh for the Trojans, as they watched him"
3763,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Taking his header, coming up, and swimming,"
3764,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,And spitting out salt water.
3765,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
3766,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The two last ones,"
3767,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Mnestheus and Sergestus, were encouraged;"
3768,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Gyas was easy now; Sergestus managed
3769,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"To get ahead, a little; he neared the rock,"
3770,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Less than a length ahead; the rival _Dragon_
3771,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Was lapped on him, and up and down, amidships,"
3772,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Went Mnestheus, cheering on his crew:--“Get going,"
3773,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Rise to the oars, my comrades, men of Hector"
3774,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Whom I picked out for mine in Troy’s last moment.
3775,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Show the old spirit and the nerve that took us
3776,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Through the Gaetulian sands, Ionian waters,"
3777,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Off Cape Malea! We can’t hope to win it,--"
3778,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Let Neptune look to that!--maybe--at least,"
3779,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Whatever we do, don’t come in last! We could not"
3780,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Bear any such disgrace.” They did their utmost,"
3781,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Straining with all their might, the bronze deck shaking"
3782,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Under the effort, and the quiet ocean"
3783,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Streamed under and past them. Arms and legs were weary,"
3784,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Wobbly, shaking; breath came hard, they gulped"
3785,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And gasped for air, and sweat ran down in rivers,"
3786,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And they had some luck. Sergestus, out of his senses,"
3787,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Drove in, too close, and piled up on the rock,"
3788,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Which almost bounced as he hit there, and the oars"
3789,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Were sheared away, and the bow hung up, and the sailors,"
3790,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Shouting like mad, pushed hard with pikes or boat-hooks,"
3791,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Or the wreck of the oars, to shove them off. And Mnestheus"
3792,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Easier now, and with exalted spirit"
3793,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"From this much victory, with a prayer to the winds"
3794,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And the oars’ swift drive, was running down-hill waters,"
3795,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Over the open ocean, as a dove"
3796,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Suddenly startled out of her nest in a cavern
3797,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Where the young brood waits, wings to the fields in fright,"
3798,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Flapping on anxious pinions, and recovers,"
3799,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And skims down peaceful air, with never a motion"
3800,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Of wing in the lifting air, so Mnestheus sped,"
3801,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"So sped the _Dragon_, racing home, and the sweep"
3802,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Of her own speed made a wind. She passed Sergestus
3803,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Struggling, rock-bound, in shallow water, howling"
3804,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"For help, in vain, and learning how to manage"
3805,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,A boat when the oars are broken. She overhauled
3806,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Gyas, in the _Chimaera_, wallowing heavy"
3807,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Without a pilot. Only Cloanthus was left;
3808,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"They were after him with all their might, the clamor"
3809,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Rose twice as loud; they were cheering the pursuer,"
3810,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,And the sky was a crash of shouting. On the _Scylla_
3811,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"They would give their lives to hold their place, they have won it,"
3812,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The glory and honor are theirs already, almost;"
3813,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,And Mnestheus’ men take courage from their nearness;
3814,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"They can because they think they can. They would have,"
3815,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Perhaps, or tied, at least had not Cloanthus"
3816,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Taken to prayer:--“Gods of the seas, whose waters"
3817,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"I skim, whose empire lifts me up, I gladly"
3818,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Promise you sacrifice, a snow-white bullock"
3819,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"At altars on this shore, and wine for the ocean,"
3820,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,And the entrails flung to the flood!” Under the waves
3821,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The Nereids heard him, Phorcus, Panopea"
3822,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The maiden, and Portunus, the big-handed,"
3823,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Boosted him on his way. Swifter than arrow,"
3824,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Swifter than wind, the ship swept into the harbor."
3825,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
3826,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The herald’s cry proclaimed Cloanthus victor,"
3827,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"When all were summoned, and Anchises’ son"
3828,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Put the green bay leaf on his temples, silver"
3829,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And wine for the ships, a steer for each. The captains"
3830,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Have special prizes; the winner has a mantle,"
3831,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Woven with gold, and a double seam of crimson,"
3832,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With a story in the texture, Ganymede"
3833,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Hunting on Ida, breathless, tossing darts"
3834,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And racing after the deer, and caught and carried"
3835,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"In the talons of Jove’s eagle, soaring skyward,"
3836,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"While the boy’s old guardians reach their hands up, vainly,"
3837,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And the hounds set up a cry. Mnestheus, second,"
3838,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Has a coat of mail, with triple links of gold,"
3839,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,A trophy of Demoleos; Aeneas
3840,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Had beaten him at Troy, by Simois river,"
3841,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And taken the armor, glory and guard in battle."
3842,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The servants, Sagaris and Phegeus, hardly"
3843,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Can lift it up, but when Demoleos wore it,"
3844,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"He could go, full-speed, after the flying Trojans."
3845,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The third award is a pair of brazen caldrons,"
3846,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,And bowls embossed in silver.
3847,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
3848,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,They had their prizes
3849,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And went their way, proud of their wealth, and shining"
3850,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With foreheads garlanded, when with much effort,"
3851,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Scraped off the rock, oars lost, and one bank crippled,"
3852,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Here came Sergestus, butt of jeering laughter,"
3853,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Like a snake with a broken back, which a wagon-wheel"
3854,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Runs over on the road, or a traveller smashes"
3855,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With the weight of a stone, and, crushed, it writhes and struggles,"
3856,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Looping the coils, and half of it is angry"
3857,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With fiery eyes and hissing mouth, and half"
3858,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Keeps dragging back the rest and doubles over
3859,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"On useless muscles, powerless; Sergestus"
3860,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Came home like such a serpent, maimed and broken,"
3861,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"But the sail went bravely up as they made the harbor,"
3862,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And Aeneas kept his promise to the captain,"
3863,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Glad for the ship’s return, and the safe sailors."
3864,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"A slave-girl, Pholoe from Crete, accomplished"
3865,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"At weaving, was his prize, and her twin children,"
3866,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Boy-infants, at the breast."
3867,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The boat-race over, Aeneas makes his way"
3868,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"To a grassy plain, with wooded hills surrounding"
3869,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,The race-course in the valley. All the crowd
3870,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Come trooping after, group themselves around"
3871,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,The central prominence. Rewards and prizes
3872,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Draw the competitors, travellers and natives,"
3873,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Trojans, Sicilians; in the foremost ranks"
3874,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Are Nisus and Euryalus, the latter"
3875,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Conspicuous in the flower of youth and beauty,"
3876,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Whom Nisus follows with entire devotion:
3877,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Diores, of the royal house of Priam,"
3878,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Was ready; Salius, an Acarnanian;"
3879,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Patron, Tegean-born; and two Sicilians,"
3880,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Panopes, Helymus, trained to the forests,"
3881,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Companions of Acestes; and many others
3882,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Whose fame by now the darkness hides. Aeneas
3883,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Speaks to their hope:--“No one goes unrewarded:
3884,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"To each I give two Cretan arrows, gleaming"
3885,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With polished steel, and a double-bitted axe"
3886,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Embossed with silver. Everybody wins
3887,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"These prizes, but the first three runners also"
3888,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Shall wear the wreath of olive, and the winner"
3889,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Ride home a horse equipped with splendid trappings;
3890,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"For second place, an Amazonian quiver"
3891,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With Thracian arrows, a broad belt of gold"
3892,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,With jeweled buckle; and this Argive helmet
3893,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,For the one who comes in third.”
3894,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
3895,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"They take their places,"
3896,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And when the signal is given, away they go,"
3897,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Like rain from storm-cloud, bodies leaning forward,"
3898,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Eyes on the goal. And for the lead it’s Nisus,"
3899,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Swifter than winds or lightning; running second,"
3900,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"A good way back, comes Salius; and the third one,"
3901,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Third at some distance, is Euryalus,"
3902,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Helymus next; right on his heels Diores.
3903,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"There’s a little crowding there, the course too narrow,"
3904,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Diores, full of run, is in a pocket,"
3905,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"He can’t get through. The race is almost over,"
3906,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Their breath comes hard, they are almost at the finish,--"
3907,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"There’s a pool of blood on the ground, where the slain bullocks"
3908,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Fell in the sacrifice, a slippery puddle"
3909,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Red on green ground, and Nisus does not see it,"
3910,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Nisus, still leading, thinking himself the winner,"
3911,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Is out of luck, his feet slide out from under,"
3912,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"He wobbles, totters, recovers himself a little,"
3913,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Slips and goes forward, in a beautiful header"
3914,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Through blood and mud. But he keeps his wits about him,"
3915,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Does not forget his friend Euryalus; rising,"
3916,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And sort of accidentally on purpose,"
3917,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Gets in the way of Salius and spills him,"
3918,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"A cartwheel, head over heels on the flying sand."
3919,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Euryalus flashes past, an easy winner"
3920,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Thanks to his friend’s assistance, and they cheer him;"
3921,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Helymus second; in third place, Diores."
3922,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
3923,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Immediately there’s a loud howl of protest,"
3924,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Salius shrieking in the elders’ faces
3925,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With cries of _Foul!_ and _Outrage!_ “I was robbed,"
3926,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Give me first prize!” But all the popular favor
3927,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Sides with Euryalus, who is young, and weeping,"
3928,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And better-looking; and Diores backs him,"
3929,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Loudly, of course, since who would get the helmet"
3930,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,If Salius was first? Aeneas ends it:--
3931,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,“The race will stand as run; you get your prizes
3932,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,As first proposed; no one will change the order;
3933,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"But one thing I can do, and will do,--offer"
3934,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,A consolation to our innocent friend.”
3935,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With this, he gives a lion-skin to Salius,"
3936,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Heavy with shaggy hair, and the claws gilded."
3937,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Nisus is heard from:--“If you’re giving prizes
3938,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"For falling down, what’s good enough for Nisus?"
3939,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"I would have won it surely, only Fortune"
3940,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Gave me the same bad deal she handed Salius!”
3941,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,And with the words he made a sudden gesture
3942,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Showing his muddy face. Aeneas, laughing,"
3943,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Ordered another prize, a shield for him,"
3944,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The work of Didymaon, stolen by Greeks,"
3945,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"From Neptune’s temple sometime, but recovered,"
3946,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,A worthy prize for a distinguished hero.
3947,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
3948,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Next is a boxing-bout. “Whoever has courage
3949,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And fighting spirit in his heart, step forward"
3950,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And put the gloves on!” There are double prizes,"
3951,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"For the winner a bullock, decked with gold and ribbons,"
3952,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,A sword and shining helmet for the loser.
3953,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Without delay, Dares gets up; a murmur"
3954,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Runs through the crowd as this big man comes forward.
3955,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"They know that he was Paris’ sparring-partner,"
3956,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,And they recall his famous match with Butes
3957,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"At Hector’s tomb, where he knocked out that champion"
3958,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,And stretched him dying on the yellow sand.
3959,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Now Dares holds his head up for the battle,"
3960,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Shakes his broad shoulders loose, warms up a little,"
3961,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"A left, a right, a left, in shadow-boxing."
3962,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Who will oppose him? No one puts the gloves on,"
3963,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"No one, from all that throng, is in a hurry"
3964,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"To take on Dares. So, exultant, thinking"
3965,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Himself a winner by default, he grabs"
3966,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The bullock by one horn, says to Aeneas:--"
3967,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"“If no man, goddess-born, is taking chances,"
3968,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,How long must I keep standing here? How long
3969,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Hang around waiting? Give the order, let me"
3970,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Lead home my prize!” The Trojans all applaud him.
3971,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"But king Acestes, sprawling on the greensward"
3972,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Beside Entellus, nudges him a little:--"
3973,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"“What was the use, Entellus, of being a hero,"
3974,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Of having been our bravest, under Eryx?"
3975,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Where is that old Sicilian reputation,"
3976,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,And all those prizes hanging from the rafters?
3977,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Does Dares get away with this, no contest,"
3978,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And all those prizes, and you sit here tamely?”"
3979,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Entellus answers, “Oh, I still love glory"
3980,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And praise; there’s nothing the matter with my courage,"
3981,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"But I’m too old, the blood is slow and colder,"
3982,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,The strength not what it used to be. That bragger
3983,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Has one thing, youth, and how he revels in it!"
3984,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"If I had what he has, I’d not need prizes,"
3985,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Bullocks or helmets either, to get me fighting.”"
3986,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,From somewhere he produced the gloves of Eryx
3987,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And tossed them into the ring, all stiff and heavy,"
3988,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Seven layers of hide, and insewn lead and iron."
3989,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The people stand amazed, and Dares shudders,"
3990,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Wanting no part of gloves like these; Aeneas
3991,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Inspects them, turning them slowly, over and over,"
3992,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,And old Entellus adds a word of comment:--
3993,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"“Why, these are nothing! What if you had seen"
3994,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,The gloves of Hercules? He used to fight here.
3995,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,These are the gloves that Eryx wore against him.
3996,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,You still can see the blood and a splash of brains
3997,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,That stained them long ago. I used to wear them
3998,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Myself when I was younger, and unchallenged"
3999,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"By Time, that envious rival. But if Dares"
4000,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Declines these arms, all right, make matters equal,"
4001,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Don’t be afraid; I waive the gloves of Eryx,"
4002,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,You put the Trojan gloves aside; Aeneas
4003,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Will see fair play, Acestes be my second.”"
4004,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"He throws the double cloak from off his shoulders,"
4005,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Strips down to the great limbs, great bones, great muscles"
4006,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,A giant in the ring. Aeneas brings them
4007,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Matched pairs of gloves.
4008,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
4009,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"They take their stand, each rising"
4010,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"On the balls of his feet, their arms upraised, and rolling"
4011,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Their heads back from the punch. They spar, they lead,"
4012,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"They watch for openings. Dares, much the younger,"
4013,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Is much the better in footwork; old Entellus
4014,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Has to rely on strength; his knees are shaky,"
4015,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"His wind not what it was. They throw their punches,"
4016,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And many miss; and some, with a solid thump,"
4017,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Land on the ribs or chest; temples and ears
4018,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Feel the wind of a miss, or the jaws rattle"
4019,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"When a punch lands. Entellus stands flat-footed,"
4020,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Wasting no motion, just a slip of the body,"
4021,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The watchful eyes alert. And Dares, feinting,"
4022,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Like one who artfully attacks a city,"
4023,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Tries this approach, then that, dancing around him"
4024,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"In varied vain attack. Entellus, rising,"
4025,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Draws back his right (in fact, he telegraphs it),"
4026,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And Dares, seeing it coming, slips aside;"
4027,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Entellus lands on nothing but the wind
4028,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And, thrown off balance, heavily comes down"
4029,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Flat on his face, as falls on Erymanthus"
4030,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"A thunder-smitten oak, and so on, and so on."
4031,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Roaring, the Trojans and Sicilians both"
4032,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Rise to their feet; the noise goes up to heaven;
4033,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Acestes rushes in, to raise his comrade"
4034,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,In pity and sorrow. But that old-time fighter
4035,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Is not slowed down a bit, nor made more wary;"
4036,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"His rage is terrible, and his shame awakens"
4037,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,A consciousness of strength. He chases Dares
4038,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"All over the ring, left, right, left, right, the punches"
4039,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Rattle like hailstones on a roof; he batters Dares,"
4040,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Spins him halfway around with one hand, clouts him"
4041,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Straight with the other again. At last Aeneas
4042,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Steps in and stops it, with a word of comfort"
4043,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"For the exhausted Dares:--“Luckless fellow,"
4044,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Yield to the god! What madness blinds your vision
4045,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"To strength beyond your own?” They rescue Dares,"
4046,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And drag him to the ships, with his knees caving,"
4047,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Head rolling side to side, spitting out blood"
4048,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,And teeth; he hardly sees the sword and helmet.
4049,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"They leave the palm and bullock for Entellus,"
4050,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Who, in the pride of victory, cries aloud:"
4051,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"“Look, goddess-born! Watch, Trojans, and discover"
4052,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Two things--how strong I was when I was younger,"
4053,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,And what a death you’ve kept away from Dares!”
4054,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And, with the word, he faced his prize, the bullock,"
4055,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Drew back his right hand, poised it, sent it smashing"
4056,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Between the horns, shattering the skull, and splashing"
4057,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Brains on the bones, as the great beast came down, lifeless."
4058,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"“This life, a better one than Dares’, Eryx,"
4059,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"I vow as sacrifice, and so, victorious,"
4060,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Retire, and lay aside the gloves forever.”"
4061,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
4062,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Next comes an archery contest. Aeneas offers
4063,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Prizes and summons; on Serestus’ vessel
4064,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The mast is raised, and from its top a cord"
4065,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,With a fluttering dove bound to it as the mark.
4066,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Four enter; a bronze helmet takes the lots,"
4067,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Hippocoön’s leaps out first; then Mnestheus follows,"
4068,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Green with the olive garland, sign and token"
4069,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Of ship well driven; and third was Pandarus’ brother,"
4070,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Eurytion; Pandarus was the archer
4071,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Who once broke truce with the Greeks, firing an arrow"
4072,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"In the days of peace; and last came king Acestes,"
4073,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Willing to try his hand with younger men.
4074,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
4075,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"They bend the pliant bows, each archer straining,"
4076,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Draw shaft from quiver. First from the twanging string
4077,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Hippocoön’s arrow flew, through sky, through wind,"
4078,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Reaching its mark in the wood of the mast, which trembled"
4079,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And the bird flapped wings in terror, and the crowd"
4080,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Rang with applause. Mnestheus took his stand,"
4081,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Drawing the bow back, aiming a little higher,"
4082,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And missed the bird, but severed knot and tether,"
4083,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And the dove sped free to the south. Eurytion, waiting"
4084,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And ready, called in prayer upon his brother,"
4085,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Let the dart fly, brought down the bird, exulting,"
4086,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"From under the dark of the cloud. She came down lifeless,"
4087,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Pierced by the arrow still. No prize was left
4088,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"For king Acestes, but he fired his arrow,"
4089,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"High as he could, to prove his skill. And a wonder"
4090,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Came to their eyes; it proved an omen later
4091,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,When seers explained its meaning. The shaft caught fire
4092,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Flying amid the clouds, a course of flame,"
4093,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Vanishing into space, as comets stream"
4094,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Sweeping across the heaven, their long train flying"
4095,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Behind them through the sky. All hearts were shaken,"
4096,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Sicilian, Trojan, both, and all men prayed"
4097,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"To the powers on high. Aeneas hailed the omen,"
4098,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Embraced Acestes, loaded him with presents,"
4099,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Saying, “Receive them, father; for the king"
4100,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Of heaven has willed it so, unusual honors"
4101,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"For skill surpassing. This bowl, with graven figures,"
4102,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Anchises owned, given him by a Thracian,"
4103,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"King Cisseus, memorial and token,"
4104,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Of everlasting friendship.” On his brows
4105,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"He bound green laurel, hailing Acestes victor"
4106,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Over the rest, and no one grudged the honor,"
4107,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Not even Eurytion, who had shot the dove;"
4108,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Mnestheus, for the cutting of the tether,"
4109,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Took his reward, and the one who hit the mast,"
4110,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Hippocoön, was not forgotten either."
4111,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
4112,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"But while the shoot was on, Aeneas called"
4113,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Epytides, Iulus’ guardian, to him,"
4114,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With words for a loyal ear:--“Go, tell Iulus,"
4115,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"If the boys are ready, and the horses marshalled,"
4116,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"To lead them, for Anchises’ sake, presenting"
4117,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Himself in arms.” And he bade the throng draw back,"
4118,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Leaving the long course clear and the field open.
4119,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The boys rode in, shining on bridled ponies"
4120,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Before their fathers’ eyes, in true formation,"
4121,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,To a murmur of delight. The garlands weighed
4122,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The young hair down, they carried cornel spear-wands"
4123,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,With iron at the tip; and some had quivers
4124,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Bright-polished, at their shoulders; torques of gold"
4125,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Looped high on the breast in pliant rings. Three leaders
4126,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Led, each, three squadrons, and a dozen followed"
4127,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Each gay young captain. One of them was Priam,"
4128,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Son of Polites, and King Priam’s grandson,"
4129,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"On a piebald Thracian, white of brow and fetlock."
4130,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Young Atys led another line--(The Atii,"
4131,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"In Latium, claim descent from him)--young Atys,"
4132,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Iulus’ special friend. And last, most handsome,"
4133,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Iulus rode a Carthaginian courser,"
4134,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Queen Dido’s gift. Sicilian horses carried
4135,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The other riders, who rode up to the cheering"
4136,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Shy, as they heard the sound, and the fond welcome"
4137,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Of crowds that saw the fathers in the children.
4138,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"They rode full circle once, and then a signal,"
4139,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"A crack of the whip, was given, and they parted"
4140,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Into three groups, went galloping off, recalled,"
4141,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Wheeled, made mock charge, with lances at the ready,"
4142,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Made march and counter-march, troops intermingled"
4143,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With troops, to right and left, in mimic battle,"
4144,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Mimic retreat, and mimic peace, a course"
4145,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Confusing as the Labyrinth in Crete
4146,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Whose path runs through blind walls, where craft has hidden"
4147,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"A thousand wandering ways, mistake and error"
4148,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Threading insoluble mazes, so the children,"
4149,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The sons of Troy, wove in and out, in conflict"
4150,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"In flight and sport, as happy as dolphins leaping"
4151,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Through the Carpathian waters. This was a custom
4152,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Ascanius, when grown, himself established"
4153,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"At Alba Longa, his own town, and taught there"
4154,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"What he had learned in boyhood, and the Albans"
4155,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"In turn informed their children, and the Romans"
4156,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Keep this ancestral rite; the boys are Troy,"
4157,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And the game Trojan, to this very day,"
4158,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"From its first observance, in Anchises’ honor."
4159,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
4160,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Here fortune changed, not keeping faith; for Juno,"
4161,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"While the ritual of sport went on, sent Iris,"
4162,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With a fair wind, to the Trojan fleet. She was angry,"
4163,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Still, and the ancient grudge unsatisfied,"
4164,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And Iris, over her thousand-colored rainbow,"
4165,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Ran her swift path, unseen, beheld the crowd,"
4166,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Surveyed the shore, harbor and fleet deserted,"
4167,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,While far off on the lonely coast the women
4168,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Mourned for Anchises lost, weeping and watching"
4169,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The unfathomable deep. “For weary people,"
4170,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Alas! how much remains, of shoal and ocean!”"
4171,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"So ran the common sigh. They crave a city,"
4172,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"They are tired of bearing the vast toil of sailing,"
4173,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And into their midst came Iris, versed in mischief,"
4174,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Laying aside her goddess-guise, becoming"
4175,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Old Beroe, Doryclus’ wife, who sometime"
4176,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Had children, fame, and lineage. Now Iris,"
4177,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Resembling her, came down to the Trojan mothers."
4178,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"“Alas for us!” she cried, “on whom the Greeks"
4179,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Never laid hands, to drag us down to death"
4180,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Before our native walls! Unfortunate people,"
4181,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"For what is fortune saving us, what doom,"
4182,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,What dying? It is seven weary summers
4183,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Since Troy’s destruction, and still we wander over"
4184,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"All lands, all seas, with rocks and stars forever"
4185,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Implacable, as we go on pursuing"
4186,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,A land that flees forever over the waters.
4187,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Here lived our brother Eryx, here we find"
4188,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"A welcomer, king Acestes; who forbids us"
4189,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"To found the walls, to build our city here?"
4190,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"O fatherland, O household gods in vain"
4191,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Saved from the Greeks, will there never be any walls"
4192,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"For Troy again? No Simois or Xanthus,"
4193,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The rivers Hector loved? Come with me, burn"
4194,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"These vessels of ill-omen. Let me tell you,"
4195,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,I have been given warnings; in a dream
4196,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"I saw Cassandra, she was giving me firebrands,"
4197,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"_Here seek your Troy, here is your home_, she told me;"
4198,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"It is time for us to act, be quick about it!"
4199,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Neptune himself, with fire on these four altars,"
4200,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Provides the method, and the resolution.”"
4201,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
4202,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,She was the first to seize a brand; she raised it
4203,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Above her head, and swung it, streaming and glowing,"
4204,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And flung it forth. The women, for a moment,"
4205,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Stood in bewilderment, and one, the oldest,"
4206,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Named Pyrgo, nurse to Priam’s many children,"
4207,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Cried out:--“This is no Beroe, I tell you,"
4208,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Mothers! Look at her flashing eyes, her spirit,"
4209,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Her stride, her features; every mark of the goddess"
4210,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Attends her presence. Beroe I myself
4211,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Have just now come from; she lies ill and grieving
4212,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"All by herself, in sorrow for her absence"
4213,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,From reverence for Anchises.”
4214,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
4215,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,As they gazed
4216,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Doubtfully at the ships, with sullen eyes,"
4217,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Distracted, torn between a sickly yearning"
4218,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"For present land and rest, and the kingdoms calling"
4219,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Them fatefully over the sea, the goddess, cleaving"
4220,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The air on her bright pinions, rose to heaven."
4221,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"They were shaken then, amazed, and frenzy-driven;"
4222,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,They cried aloud; tore fire from the hearths and altars;
4223,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Made tinder of the altar-decorations,"
4224,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The garlandry and wreaths. And the fire, let loose,"
4225,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Rioted over thwarts and oars and rigging.
4226,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
4227,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,To theatre and tomb Eumelus brought
4228,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Word of the ships on fire; and the men could see
4229,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The black ash billowing in the smoky cloud,"
4230,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And first Ascanius, as full of spirit"
4231,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"As when he led the games, rushed to the trouble"
4232,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,As fast as he could ride; no troubled masters
4233,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Could hold him back. “Poor things, what are you doing?"
4234,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,What craziness is this? what are you up to?
4235,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"It is no Greek camp, no enemy you’re burning"
4236,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"But your own hopes! Look at me! Here I am,"
4237,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Your own Ascanius!” And before their feet
4238,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,He flung the helmet he had worn when leading
4239,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,The little war-game. And Aeneas hurried
4240,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,With others to the troubled camp. The women
4241,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Scattered and fled along the shore, in terror"
4242,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And guilt, wherever they could, to hiding-places"
4243,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,In woods or caves in the rock; they are ashamed
4244,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Of daylight and their deed; Juno is shaken
4245,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Out of their hearts, and they recognize their own."
4246,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,That does not stop the fire; it burns in fury
4247,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Under wet oak, tow smoulders, and the stubborn"
4248,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Steam eats the keels away, destruction seizing"
4249,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"On deck and hull, and water can not quench it,"
4250,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Nor any strength of men. Tearing his garment
4251,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Loose from his shoulders, Aeneas prays to heaven:--"
4252,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"“Almighty Jove, if the Trojans are not hateful"
4253,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"To the last man, if any record of goodness"
4254,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Alleviates human trouble, let our fleet"
4255,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Escape this flame, O father; save from doom"
4256,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"This little Trojan remnant; or with lightning,"
4257,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"If I deserve it, strike us down forever!”"
4258,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"He had scarcely spoken, when a cloudburst fell"
4259,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Full force, with darkness and black tempest streaming,"
4260,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And thunder rumbling over plain and hillock,"
4261,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,The whole sky pouring rain; the ships were drowned
4262,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With water from above, the half-burnt timbers"
4263,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Were soaked, and the hiss of steam died out; four vessels"
4264,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Were gone, the others rescued from disaster."
4265,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
4266,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And now Aeneas, stunned by the bitter evil,"
4267,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Was troubled at heart, uncertain, anxious, grieving:"
4268,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,What could be done? forget the call of the fates
4269,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And settle here in Sicily, or keep on"
4270,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"To the coast of Italy? An old man, Nautes,"
4271,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Whom Pallas had instructed in deep wisdom,"
4272,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Gave him the answer. “Goddess-born, wherever"
4273,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Fate pulls or hauls us, there we have to follow;"
4274,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Whatever happens, fortune can be beaten"
4275,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,By nothing but endurance. We have here
4276,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"A friend, Acestes, Trojan-born, divine"
4277,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"In parentage; make him an ally in counsel,"
4278,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Partner in enterprise; to him hand over
4279,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The ones whose ships are lost, and all the weary,"
4280,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The sick and tired, the old men, and the mothers"
4281,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Who have had too much of the sea, and the faint-hearted,"
4282,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Whose weariness may find a city for them
4283,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Here in this land; Acesta, let them call it.”"
4284,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,The old man’s words still troubled him; the mind
4285,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Was torn this way and that. Night rode the heavens
4286,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"In her dark chariot, and there came from the darkness"
4287,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The image of Anchises, speaking to him"
4288,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"In words of comfort:--“Son, more dear to me"
4289,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Than life, when life was mine; son, sorely troubled"
4290,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"By Trojan fate, I come at Jove’s command,"
4291,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Who drove the fire away, and from the heaven"
4292,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Has taken pity. Obey the words of Nautes,"
4293,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"He gives the best of counsel; the flower of the youth,"
4294,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The bravest hearts, lead on to Italy."
4295,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"There will be trouble there, a rugged people"
4296,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Must be subdued in Latium. Come to meet me,"
4297,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"First, in the lower world; come through Avernus"
4298,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"To find me, son. Tartarus’ evil prison"
4299,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Of gloomy shades I know not, for I dwell"
4300,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Among the happy spirits in Elysium.
4301,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Black sheep are good for sacrifice. The Sibyl,"
4302,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"A holy guide, will lead the way, foretelling"
4303,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The race to come, the given walls. Farewell,"
4304,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"My son; the dewy night is almost over,"
4305,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,I feel the breath of the morning’s cruel horses.”
4306,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"He spoke, and vanished, smoke into airy thinness,"
4307,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"From the cries of his son, who woke, and roused the embers"
4308,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Of the drowsing altar-fires, with meal and censer"
4309,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Propitiating Vesta, making worship"
4310,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,To Trojan household gods.
4311,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
4312,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,And called Acestes
4313,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And the Trojan counsellors, told them of Jove"
4314,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And his good father’s orders, the decision"
4315,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"He has reached at last. They all agree, Acestes"
4316,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Accepts the trust. They make a roll for the city,"
4317,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The women-folk, the people willing to linger,"
4318,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,The unadventurous; and they make ready
4319,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The thwarts again, replace the fire-scorched timbers,"
4320,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Fit out new oars and rigging. There are not many,"
4321,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"But a living company, for war brave-hearted."
4322,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Aeneas ploughs the limits for the city,"
4323,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Sets out new homes, Ilium, again, and Troy,"
4324,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"A kingdom welcome to Acestes, senate"
4325,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And courts, and laws, established; and a shrine"
4326,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"High on the crest of Eryx, is given Venus,"
4327,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Near the high stars, and a priest assigned as warden"
4328,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,To the wide boundaries of Anchises’ grove.
4329,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
4330,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Nine days they hold farewells, one tribe together"
4331,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"For the last time, with honor at the altars,"
4332,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And seas are calm, and winds go down, and the whisper"
4333,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Of a little breeze calls to the sail; the shore
4334,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Hears a great wail arise; they cling to each other
4335,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"All through the night and day. Even the mothers,"
4336,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The weary men, to whom the face of the sea"
4337,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Once seemed so cruel, and its very name"
4338,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"A menacing monster, want to go now, willing"
4339,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,For all the toil of exile. These Aeneas
4340,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Comforts with friendly words, and bids Acestes"
4341,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Be their good brother. Then he slays to Eryx
4342,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Three bullocks, and a lamb to the gods of storm-cloud."
4343,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,It is time to loose the cables. At the bow
4344,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"He stands, his temples garlanded with olive,"
4345,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Makes to the sea libation of wine and entrails,"
4346,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And the wind comes up astern, and they sweep the waters"
4347,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,In happy rivalry.
4348,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
4349,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"But meanwhile Venus,"
4350,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Driven by worry, went to Neptune, pouring"
4351,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Complaints from a full heart:--“Neptune, the anger"
4352,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Of Juno, her insatiable vengeance,"
4353,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Which neither time nor any goodness softens,"
4354,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Drives me to humble prayer. She never weakens
4355,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"For Jove’s command, nor the orders of the fates;"
4356,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,It is not enough for her that the Trojan city
4357,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Is quite consumed by hatred, and the remnants"
4358,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Of that poor town harried all over the world
4359,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,With every kind of punishment; she still follows
4360,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Even their bones and ashes. She may know
4361,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,The reasons for that wrath of hers. Remember
4362,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,How great a weight of water she stirred up lately
4363,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"In the Libyan seas, confusing sky and ocean,"
4364,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With Aeolus conspiring, and in your kingdom!"
4365,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,And now her crime has driven the Trojan mothers
4366,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"To burn their ships, to give their comrades over"
4367,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,To a coast unknown. Let what is left come safely
4368,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Over the sea, to reach Laurentian Tiber,"
4369,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"If what I ask is just, if those are walls"
4370,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Due them by fate’s decree.”
4371,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
4372,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,And Neptune answered:--
4373,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,“None has a better right to trust my kingdom
4374,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Than the goddess born of the sea-foam. And I have earned
4375,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,This confidence. I have often checked the anger
4376,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Of sea and sky. And the rivers of Troy are witness
4377,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"I have helped on land as well, and saved Aeneas."
4378,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"When thousands died at Troy, with fierce Achilles"
4379,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"In hot pursuit, and the rivers groaned, and Xanthus"
4380,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Could hardly find the sea, I formed a cloud"
4381,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Around Aeneas, when he met Achilles"
4382,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With the gods adverse, and no great strength to help him"
4383,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"I rescued him, in spite of my own anger"
4384,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"At the perjury of Troy, in spite of my passion"
4385,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,To raze the walls I had built. Now too my purpose
4386,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Remains; have done with fear; he will reach in safety
4387,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,The haven of Avernus; the prayer is granted.
4388,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Let one be lost in the flood, one life alone"
4389,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Be given for the many.”
4390,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,
4391,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"This comfort given,"
4392,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"To bring the goddess joy, he yoked his horses,"
4393,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Gold bridle, foaming bit, and sent them flying"
4394,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With the lightest touch of the reins, skimming the surface"
4395,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"In the bright blue car; and the waves went down, the axle"
4396,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Subdued the swell of the wave, and storm-clouds melted"
4397,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"To nothing in the sky, and his attendants"
4398,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Followed along, great whales, and ancient Glaucus,"
4399,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Palaemon, Ino’s son, and the rushing Tritons,"
4400,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The army of Phorcus, Melite and Thetis"
4401,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Watching the left, and the maiden Panopea,"
4402,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Cymodoce and Thalia and Spio,"
4403,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"So that Aeneas, in his turn, was happy,"
4404,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Less anxious at heart. The masts are raised, and sail"
4405,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Stretched from the halyards; right and left they bend
4406,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,The canvas to fair winds: at the head of the fleet
4407,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Rides Palinurus, and the others follow,"
4408,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"As ordered, close behind him; dewy night"
4409,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Has reached mid-heaven, while the sailors, sleeping,"
4410,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Relax on the hard benches under the oars,"
4411,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"All calm, all quiet. And the god of Sleep"
4412,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Parting the shadowy air, comes gently down,"
4413,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Looking for Palinurus, bringing him,"
4414,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"A guiltless man, ill-omened dreams. He settles"
4415,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"On the high stern, a god disguised as a man,"
4416,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Speaking in Phorbas’ guise, “O Palinurus,"
4417,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The fleet rides smoothly in the even weather,"
4418,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The hour is given for rest. Lay down the head,"
4419,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Rest the tired eyes from toil. I will take over
4420,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"A little while.” But Palinurus, barely"
4421,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Lifting his eyes, made answer: “Trust the waves,"
4422,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,However quiet? trust a peaceful ocean?
4423,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Put faith in such a monster? Never! I
4424,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Have been too often fooled by the clear stars
4425,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,To trust Aeneas to their faithless keeping.”
4426,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And so he clung to the tiller, never loosed"
4427,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"His hand from the wood, his eyes from the fair heaven."
4428,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"But lo, the god over his temples shook"
4429,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"A bough that dripped with dew from Lethe, steeped"
4430,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"With Stygian magic, so the swimming eyes,"
4431,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Against his effort close, blink open, close"
4432,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Again, and slumber takes the drowsy limbs."
4433,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Bending above him, leaning over, the god"
4434,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Shoves him, still clinging to the tiller, calling"
4435,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"His comrades vainly, into the clear waves."
4436,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And the god is gone like a bird to the clear air,"
4437,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,And the fleet is going safely over its journey
4438,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"As Neptune promised. But the rocks were near,"
4439,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"The Siren-cliffs, most perilous of old,"
4440,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"White with the bones of many mariners,"
4441,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,Loud with their hoarse eternal warning sound.
4442,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Aeneas starts from sleep, aware, somehow,"
4443,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Of a lost pilot, and a vessel drifting,"
4444,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Himself takes over guidance, with a sigh"
4445,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"And heartache for a friend’s mishap, “Alas,"
4446,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"Too trustful in the calm of sea and sky,"
4447,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"O Palinurus, on an unknown shore,"
4448,THE FUNERAL GAMES FOR ANCHISES,"You will be lying, naked.”"

4458,THE LOWER WORLD,"Mourning for Palinurus, he drives the fleet"
4459,THE LOWER WORLD,"To Cumae’s coast-line; the prows are turned, the anchors"
4460,THE LOWER WORLD,"Let down, the beach is covered by the vessels."
4461,THE LOWER WORLD,"Young in their eagerness for the land in the west,"
4462,THE LOWER WORLD,They flash ashore; some seek the seeds of flame
4463,THE LOWER WORLD,"Hidden in veins of flint, and others spoil"
4464,THE LOWER WORLD,"The woods of tinder, and show where water runs."
4465,THE LOWER WORLD,"Aeneas, in devotion, seeks the heights"
4466,THE LOWER WORLD,"Where stands Apollo’s temple, and the cave"
4467,THE LOWER WORLD,"Where the dread Sibyl dwells, Apollo’s priestess,"
4468,THE LOWER WORLD,"With the great mind and heart, inspired revealer"
4469,THE LOWER WORLD,"Of things to come. They enter Diana’s grove,"
4470,THE LOWER WORLD,Pass underneath the roof of gold.
4471,THE LOWER WORLD,
4472,THE LOWER WORLD,The story
4473,THE LOWER WORLD,"Has it that Daedalus fled from Minos’ kingdom,"
4474,THE LOWER WORLD,"Trusting himself to wings he made, and travelled"
4475,THE LOWER WORLD,"A course unknown to man, to the cold north,"
4476,THE LOWER WORLD,"Descending on this very summit; here,"
4477,THE LOWER WORLD,"Earth-bound again, he built a mighty temple,"
4478,THE LOWER WORLD,"Paying Apollo homage, the dedication"
4479,THE LOWER WORLD,Of the oarage of his wings. On the temple doors
4480,THE LOWER WORLD,"He carved, in bronze, Androgeos’ death, and the payment"
4481,THE LOWER WORLD,"Enforced on Cecrops’ children, seven sons"
4482,THE LOWER WORLD,"For sacrifice each year: there stands the urn,"
4483,THE LOWER WORLD,"The lots are drawn--facing this, over the sea,"
4484,THE LOWER WORLD,Rises the land of Crete: the scene portrays
4485,THE LOWER WORLD,"Pasiphae in cruel love, the bull"
4486,THE LOWER WORLD,"She took to her by cunning, and their offspring,"
4487,THE LOWER WORLD,"The mongrel Minotaur, half man, half monster,"
4488,THE LOWER WORLD,The proof of lust unspeakable; and the toil
4489,THE LOWER WORLD,"Of the house is shown, the labyrinthine maze"
4490,THE LOWER WORLD,"Which no one could have solved, but Daedalus"
4491,THE LOWER WORLD,"Pitied a princess’ love, loosened the tangle,"
4492,THE LOWER WORLD,"Gave her a skein to guide her way. His boy,"
4493,THE LOWER WORLD,"Icarus, might have been here, in the picture,"
4494,THE LOWER WORLD,And almost was--his father had made the effort
4495,THE LOWER WORLD,"Once, and once more, and dropped his hands; he could not"
4496,THE LOWER WORLD,Master his grief that much. The story held them;
4497,THE LOWER WORLD,"They would have studied it longer, but Achates"
4498,THE LOWER WORLD,"Came from his mission; with him came the priestess,"
4499,THE LOWER WORLD,"Deiphobe, daughter of Glaucus, who tends the temple"
4500,THE LOWER WORLD,For Phoebus and Diana; she warned Aeneas:
4501,THE LOWER WORLD,“It is no such sights the time demands; far better
4502,THE LOWER WORLD,"To offer sacrifice, seven chosen bullocks,"
4503,THE LOWER WORLD,"Seven chosen ewes, a herd without corruption.”"
4504,THE LOWER WORLD,"They were prompt in their obedience, and the priestess"
4505,THE LOWER WORLD,Summoned the Trojans to the lofty temple.
4506,THE LOWER WORLD,
4507,THE LOWER WORLD,"The rock’s vast side is hollowed into a cavern,"
4508,THE LOWER WORLD,"With a hundred mouths, a hundred open portals,"
4509,THE LOWER WORLD,"Whence voices rush, the answers of the Sibyl."
4510,THE LOWER WORLD,"They had reached the threshold, and the virgin cried:"
4511,THE LOWER WORLD,"“It is time to seek the fates; the god is here,"
4512,THE LOWER WORLD,"The god is here, behold him.” And as she spoke"
4513,THE LOWER WORLD,"Before the entrance, her countenance and color"
4514,THE LOWER WORLD,"Changed, and her hair tossed loose, and her heart was heaving,"
4515,THE LOWER WORLD,"Her bosom swollen with frenzy; she seemed taller,"
4516,THE LOWER WORLD,"Her voice not human at all, as the god’s presence"
4517,THE LOWER WORLD,"Drew nearer, and took hold on her. “Aeneas,”"
4518,THE LOWER WORLD,"She cried, “Aeneas, are you praying?"
4519,THE LOWER WORLD,"Are you being swift in prayer? Until you are,"
4520,THE LOWER WORLD,"The house of the gods will not be moved, nor open"
4521,THE LOWER WORLD,"Its mighty portals.” More than her speech, her silence"
4522,THE LOWER WORLD,"Made the Trojans cold with terror, and Aeneas"
4523,THE LOWER WORLD,"Prayed from the depth of his heart: “Phoebus Apollo,"
4524,THE LOWER WORLD,"Compassionate ever, slayer of Achilles"
4525,THE LOWER WORLD,"Through aim of Paris’ arrow, helper and guide"
4526,THE LOWER WORLD,"Over the seas, over the lands, the deserts,"
4527,THE LOWER WORLD,"The shoals and quicksands, now at last we have come"
4528,THE LOWER WORLD,"To Italy, we hold the lands which fled us:"
4529,THE LOWER WORLD,"Grant that thus far, no farther, a Trojan fortune"
4530,THE LOWER WORLD,"Attend our wandering. And spare us now,"
4531,THE LOWER WORLD,"All of you, gods and goddesses, who hated"
4532,THE LOWER WORLD,"Troy in the past, and Trojan glory. I beg you,"
4533,THE LOWER WORLD,"Most holy prophetess, in whose foreknowing"
4534,THE LOWER WORLD,"The future stands revealed, grant that the Trojans--"
4535,THE LOWER WORLD,I ask with fate’s permission--rest in Latium
4536,THE LOWER WORLD,"Their wandering storm-tossed gods. I will build a temple,"
4537,THE LOWER WORLD,"In honor of Apollo and Diana,"
4538,THE LOWER WORLD,"Out of eternal marble, and ordain"
4539,THE LOWER WORLD,"Festivals in their honor, and for the Sibyl"
4540,THE LOWER WORLD,"A great shrine in our kingdom, and I will place there"
4541,THE LOWER WORLD,The lots and mystic oracles for my people
4542,THE LOWER WORLD,"With chosen priests to tend them. Only, priestess,"
4543,THE LOWER WORLD,"This once, I pray you, chant the sacred verses"
4544,THE LOWER WORLD,"With your own lips; do not trust them to the leaves,"
4545,THE LOWER WORLD,The mockery of the rushing wind’s disorder.”
4546,THE LOWER WORLD,
4547,THE LOWER WORLD,"But the priestess, not yet subject to Apollo,"
4548,THE LOWER WORLD,"Went reeling through the cavern, wild, and storming"
4549,THE LOWER WORLD,"To throw the god, who presses, like a rider,"
4550,THE LOWER WORLD,"With bit and bridle and weight, tames her wild spirit,"
4551,THE LOWER WORLD,"Shapes her to his control. The doors fly open,"
4552,THE LOWER WORLD,"The hundred doors, of their own will, fly open,"
4553,THE LOWER WORLD,"And through the air the answer comes:--“O Trojans,"
4554,THE LOWER WORLD,At last the dangers of the sea are over;
4555,THE LOWER WORLD,"That course is run, but graver ones are waiting"
4556,THE LOWER WORLD,On land. The sons of Dardanus will reach
4557,THE LOWER WORLD,The kingdom of Lavinia--be easy
4558,THE LOWER WORLD,"On that account--the sons of Dardanus, also,"
4559,THE LOWER WORLD,"Will wish they had not come there. War, I see,"
4560,THE LOWER WORLD,"Terrible war, and the river Tiber foaming"
4561,THE LOWER WORLD,"With streams of blood. There will be another Xanthus,"
4562,THE LOWER WORLD,"Another Simois, and Greek encampment,"
4563,THE LOWER WORLD,"Even another Achilles, born in Latium,"
4564,THE LOWER WORLD,Himself a goddess’ son. And Juno further
4565,THE LOWER WORLD,"Will always be there: you will beg for mercy,"
4566,THE LOWER WORLD,"Be poor, turn everywhere for help. A woman"
4567,THE LOWER WORLD,"Will be the cause once more of so much evil,"
4568,THE LOWER WORLD,"A foreign bride, receptive to the Trojans,"
4569,THE LOWER WORLD,"A foreign marriage. Do not yield to evil,"
4570,THE LOWER WORLD,"Attack, attack, more boldly even than fortune"
4571,THE LOWER WORLD,"Seems to permit. An offering of safety,--"
4572,THE LOWER WORLD,Incredible!--will come from a Greek city.”
4573,THE LOWER WORLD,
4574,THE LOWER WORLD,"So, through the amplifiers of her cavern,"
4575,THE LOWER WORLD,"The hollow vaults, the Sibyl cast her warnings,"
4576,THE LOWER WORLD,"Riddles confused with truth; and Apollo rode her,"
4577,THE LOWER WORLD,"Reining her rage, and shaking her, and spurring"
4578,THE LOWER WORLD,"The fierceness of her heart. The frenzy dwindled,"
4579,THE LOWER WORLD,"A little, and her lips were still. Aeneas"
4580,THE LOWER WORLD,"Began:--“For me, no form of trouble, maiden,"
4581,THE LOWER WORLD,"Is new, or unexpected; all of this"
4582,THE LOWER WORLD,"I have known long since, lived in imagination."
4583,THE LOWER WORLD,"One thing I ask: this is the gate of the kingdom,"
4584,THE LOWER WORLD,"So it is said, where Pluto reigns, the gloomy"
4585,THE LOWER WORLD,Marsh where the water of Acheron runs over.
4586,THE LOWER WORLD,"Teach me the way from here, open the portals"
4587,THE LOWER WORLD,"That I may go to my belovèd father,"
4588,THE LOWER WORLD,"Stand in his presence, talk with him. I brought him,"
4589,THE LOWER WORLD,"Once, on these shoulders, through a thousand weapons"
4590,THE LOWER WORLD,"And following fire, and foemen. He shared with me"
4591,THE LOWER WORLD,"The road, the sea, the menaces of heaven,"
4592,THE LOWER WORLD,"Things that an old man should not bear; he bore them,"
4593,THE LOWER WORLD,Tired as he was. And he it was who told me
4594,THE LOWER WORLD,To come to you in humbleness. I beg you
4595,THE LOWER WORLD,"Pity the son, the father. You have power,"
4596,THE LOWER WORLD,"Great priestess, over all; it is not for nothing"
4597,THE LOWER WORLD,Hecate gave you this dominion over
4598,THE LOWER WORLD,Avernus’ groves. If Orpheus could summon
4599,THE LOWER WORLD,"Eurydice from the shadows with his music,"
4600,THE LOWER WORLD,"If Pollux could save his brother, coming, going,"
4601,THE LOWER WORLD,"Along this path,--why should I mention Theseus,"
4602,THE LOWER WORLD,"Why mention Hercules? I, too, descended"
4603,THE LOWER WORLD,"From the line of Jupiter.” He clasped the altar,"
4604,THE LOWER WORLD,"Making his prayer, and she made answer to him:"
4605,THE LOWER WORLD,"“Son of Anchises, born of godly lineage,"
4606,THE LOWER WORLD,"By night, by day, the portals of dark Dis"
4607,THE LOWER WORLD,"Stand open: it is easy, the descending"
4608,THE LOWER WORLD,"Down to Avernus. But to climb again,"
4609,THE LOWER WORLD,"To trace the footsteps back to the air above,"
4610,THE LOWER WORLD,"There lies the task, the toil. A few, beloved"
4611,THE LOWER WORLD,"By Jupiter, descended from the gods,"
4612,THE LOWER WORLD,"A few, in whom exalting virtue burned,"
4613,THE LOWER WORLD,Have been permitted. Around the central woods
4614,THE LOWER WORLD,"The black Cocytus glides, a sullen river;"
4615,THE LOWER WORLD,"But if such love is in your heart, such longing"
4616,THE LOWER WORLD,"For double crossing of the Stygian lake,"
4617,THE LOWER WORLD,"For double sight of Tartarus, learn first"
4618,THE LOWER WORLD,What must be done. In a dark tree there hides
4619,THE LOWER WORLD,"A bough, all golden, leaf and pliant stem,"
4620,THE LOWER WORLD,Sacred to Proserpine. This all the grove
4621,THE LOWER WORLD,"Protects, and shadows cover it with darkness."
4622,THE LOWER WORLD,"Until this bough, this bloom of light, is found,"
4623,THE LOWER WORLD,No one receives his passport to the darkness
4624,THE LOWER WORLD,"Whose queen requires this tribute. In succession,"
4625,THE LOWER WORLD,"After the bough is plucked, another grows,"
4626,THE LOWER WORLD,"Gold-green with the same metal. Raise the eyes,"
4627,THE LOWER WORLD,"Look up, reach up the hand, and it will follow"
4628,THE LOWER WORLD,"With ease, if fate is calling; otherwise,"
4629,THE LOWER WORLD,"No power, no steel, can loose it. Furthermore,"
4630,THE LOWER WORLD,"(Alas, you do not know this!), one of your men"
4631,THE LOWER WORLD,"Lies on the shore, unburied, a pollution"
4632,THE LOWER WORLD,"To all the fleet, while you have come for counsel"
4633,THE LOWER WORLD,Here to our threshold. Bury him with honor;
4634,THE LOWER WORLD,Black cattle slain in expiation for him
4635,THE LOWER WORLD,"Must fall before you see the Stygian kingdoms,"
4636,THE LOWER WORLD,The groves denied to living men.”
4637,THE LOWER WORLD,
4638,THE LOWER WORLD,"Aeneas,"
4639,THE LOWER WORLD,"With sadness in his eyes, and downcast heart,"
4640,THE LOWER WORLD,"Turned from the cave, and at his side Achates"
4641,THE LOWER WORLD,Accompanied his anxious meditations.
4642,THE LOWER WORLD,They talked together: who could be the comrade
4643,THE LOWER WORLD,"Named by the priestess, lying there unburied?"
4644,THE LOWER WORLD,"And they found him on dry sand; it was Misenus,"
4645,THE LOWER WORLD,"Aeolus’ son, none better with the trumpet"
4646,THE LOWER WORLD,To make men burn for warfare. He had been
4647,THE LOWER WORLD,Great Hector’s man-at-arms; he was good in battle
4648,THE LOWER WORLD,"With spear as well as horn, and after Hector"
4649,THE LOWER WORLD,"Had fallen to Achilles, he had followed"
4650,THE LOWER WORLD,"Aeneas, entering no meaner service."
4651,THE LOWER WORLD,Some foolishness came over him; he made
4652,THE LOWER WORLD,The ocean echo to the blare of his trumpet
4653,THE LOWER WORLD,"That day, and challenged the sea-gods to a contest"
4654,THE LOWER WORLD,"In martial music, and Triton, jealous, caught him,"
4655,THE LOWER WORLD,"However unbelievable the story,"
4656,THE LOWER WORLD,"And held him down between the rocks, and drowned him"
4657,THE LOWER WORLD,"Under the foaming waves. His comrades mourned,"
4658,THE LOWER WORLD,"Aeneas most of all, and in their sorrow"
4659,THE LOWER WORLD,"They carry out, in haste, the Sibyl’s orders,"
4660,THE LOWER WORLD,"Construct the funeral altar, high as heaven,"
4661,THE LOWER WORLD,"They go to an old wood, and the pine-trees fall"
4662,THE LOWER WORLD,"Where wild beasts have their dens, and holm-oak rings"
4663,THE LOWER WORLD,"To the stroke of the axe, and oak and ash are riven"
4664,THE LOWER WORLD,"By the splitting wedge, and rowan-trees come rolling"
4665,THE LOWER WORLD,"Down the steep mountain-side. Aeneas helps them,"
4666,THE LOWER WORLD,"And cheers them on; studies the endless forest,"
4667,THE LOWER WORLD,"Takes thought, and prays: “If only we might see it,"
4668,THE LOWER WORLD,"That golden bough, here in the depth of the forest,"
4669,THE LOWER WORLD,"Bright on some tree. She told the truth, our priestess,"
4670,THE LOWER WORLD,"Too much, too bitter truth, about Misenus.”"
4671,THE LOWER WORLD,No sooner had he spoken than twin doves
4672,THE LOWER WORLD,"Came flying down before him, and alighted"
4673,THE LOWER WORLD,"On the green ground. He knew his mother’s birds,"
4674,THE LOWER WORLD,"And made his prayer, rejoicing,--“Oh, be leaders,"
4675,THE LOWER WORLD,"Wherever the way, and guide me to the grove"
4676,THE LOWER WORLD,Where the rich bough makes rich the shaded ground.
4677,THE LOWER WORLD,"Help me, O goddess-mother!” And he paused,"
4678,THE LOWER WORLD,"Watching what sign they gave, what course they set."
4679,THE LOWER WORLD,"The birds flew on a little, just ahead"
4680,THE LOWER WORLD,Of the pursuing vision; when they came
4681,THE LOWER WORLD,"To the jaws of dank Avernus, evil-smelling,"
4682,THE LOWER WORLD,"They rose aloft, then swooped down the bright air,"
4683,THE LOWER WORLD,"Perched on the double tree, where the off-color"
4684,THE LOWER WORLD,Of gold was gleaming golden through the branches.
4685,THE LOWER WORLD,"As mistletoe, in the cold winter, blossoms"
4686,THE LOWER WORLD,"With its strange foliage on an alien tree,"
4687,THE LOWER WORLD,"The yellow berry gilding the smooth branches,"
4688,THE LOWER WORLD,Such was the vision of the gold in leaf
4689,THE LOWER WORLD,"On the dark holm-oak, so the foil was rustling,"
4690,THE LOWER WORLD,"Rattling, almost, the bract in the soft wind"
4691,THE LOWER WORLD,Stirring like metal. Aeneas broke it off
4692,THE LOWER WORLD,"With eager grasp, and bore it to the Sibyl."
4693,THE LOWER WORLD,
4694,THE LOWER WORLD,"Meanwhile, along the shore, the Trojans mourned,"
4695,THE LOWER WORLD,Paying Misenus’ dust the final honors.
4696,THE LOWER WORLD,"A mighty pyre was raised, of pine and oak,"
4697,THE LOWER WORLD,"The sides hung with dark leaves, and somber cypress"
4698,THE LOWER WORLD,"Along the front, and gleaming arms above."
4699,THE LOWER WORLD,"Some made the water hot, and some made ready"
4700,THE LOWER WORLD,"Bronze caldrons, shimmering over fire, and others"
4701,THE LOWER WORLD,"Lave and anoint the body, and with weeping"
4702,THE LOWER WORLD,"Lay on the bier his limbs, and place above them"
4703,THE LOWER WORLD,"Familiar garments, crimson color; and some"
4704,THE LOWER WORLD,"Take up the heavy burden, a sad office,"
4705,THE LOWER WORLD,"And, as their fathers did, they kept their eyes"
4706,THE LOWER WORLD,"Averted, as they brought the torches nearer."
4707,THE LOWER WORLD,"They burn gifts with him, bowls of oil, and viands,"
4708,THE LOWER WORLD,And frankincense; and when the flame is quiet
4709,THE LOWER WORLD,"And the ashes settle to earth, they wash the embers"
4710,THE LOWER WORLD,"With wine, and slake the thirsty dust. The bones"
4711,THE LOWER WORLD,"Are placed in a bronze urn by Corynaeus,"
4712,THE LOWER WORLD,"Who, with pure water, thrice around his comrades"
4713,THE LOWER WORLD,"Made lustral cleansing, shaking gentle dew"
4714,THE LOWER WORLD,From the fruitful branch of olive; and they said
4715,THE LOWER WORLD,_Hail and farewell!_ And over him Aeneas
4716,THE LOWER WORLD,"Erects a mighty tomb, with the hero’s arms,"
4717,THE LOWER WORLD,"His oar and trumpet, where the mountain rises"
4718,THE LOWER WORLD,"Memorial for ever, and named Misenus."
4719,THE LOWER WORLD,
4720,THE LOWER WORLD,"These rites performed, he hastened to the Sibyl."
4721,THE LOWER WORLD,"There was a cavern, yawning wide and deep,"
4722,THE LOWER WORLD,"Jagged, below the darkness of the trees,"
4723,THE LOWER WORLD,Beside the darkness of the lake. No bird
4724,THE LOWER WORLD,"Could fly above it safely, with the vapor"
4725,THE LOWER WORLD,Pouring from the black gulf (the Greeks have named it
4726,THE LOWER WORLD,"Avernus, or A-Ornos, meaning _birdless_),"
4727,THE LOWER WORLD,And here the priestess for the slaughter set
4728,THE LOWER WORLD,"Four bullocks, black ones, poured the holy wine"
4729,THE LOWER WORLD,"Between the horns, and plucked the topmost bristles"
4730,THE LOWER WORLD,"For the first offering to the sacred fire,"
4731,THE LOWER WORLD,"Calling on Hecate, a power in heaven,"
4732,THE LOWER WORLD,"A power in hell. Knives to the throat were driven,"
4733,THE LOWER WORLD,The warm blood caught in bowls. Aeneas offered
4734,THE LOWER WORLD,"A lamb, black-fleeced, to Night and her great sister,"
4735,THE LOWER WORLD,A sterile heifer for the queen; for Dis
4736,THE LOWER WORLD,"An altar in the night, and on the flames"
4737,THE LOWER WORLD,"The weight of heavy bulls, the fat oil pouring"
4738,THE LOWER WORLD,"Over the burning entrails. And at dawn,"
4739,THE LOWER WORLD,"Under their feet, earth seemed to shake and rumble,"
4740,THE LOWER WORLD,"The ridges move, and bitches bay in darkness,"
4741,THE LOWER WORLD,"As the presence neared. The Sibyl cried a warning,"
4742,THE LOWER WORLD,"“Keep off, keep off, whatever is unholy,"
4743,THE LOWER WORLD,"Depart from here! Courage, Aeneas; enter"
4744,THE LOWER WORLD,"The path, unsheathe the sword. The time is ready"
4745,THE LOWER WORLD,"For the brave heart.” She strode out boldly, leading"
4746,THE LOWER WORLD,"Into the open cavern, and he followed."
4747,THE LOWER WORLD,
4748,THE LOWER WORLD,"Gods of the world of spirit, silent shadows,"
4749,THE LOWER WORLD,"Chaos and Phlegethon, areas of silence,"
4750,THE LOWER WORLD,"Wide realms of dark, may it be right and proper"
4751,THE LOWER WORLD,"To tell what I have heard, this revelation"
4752,THE LOWER WORLD,Of matters buried deep in earth and darkness!
4753,THE LOWER WORLD,
4754,THE LOWER WORLD,"Vague forms in lonely darkness, they were going"
4755,THE LOWER WORLD,"Through void and shadow, through the empty realm"
4756,THE LOWER WORLD,"Like people in a forest, when the moonlight"
4757,THE LOWER WORLD,"Shifts with a baleful glimmer, and shadow covers"
4758,THE LOWER WORLD,"The sky, and all the colors turn to blackness."
4759,THE LOWER WORLD,"At the first threshold, on the jaws of Orcus,"
4760,THE LOWER WORLD,"Grief and avenging Cares have set their couches,"
4761,THE LOWER WORLD,"And pale Diseases dwell, and sad Old Age,"
4762,THE LOWER WORLD,"Fear, evil-counselling Hunger, wretched Need,"
4763,THE LOWER WORLD,"Forms terrible to see, and Death, and Toil,"
4764,THE LOWER WORLD,"And Death’s own brother, Sleep, and evil Joys,"
4765,THE LOWER WORLD,"Fantasies of the mind, and deadly War,"
4766,THE LOWER WORLD,"The Furies’ iron chambers, Discord, raving,"
4767,THE LOWER WORLD,Her snaky hair entwined in bloody bands.
4768,THE LOWER WORLD,"An elm-tree loomed there, shadowy and huge,"
4769,THE LOWER WORLD,"The aged boughs outspread, beneath whose leaves,"
4770,THE LOWER WORLD,"Men say, the false dreams cling, thousands on thousands."
4771,THE LOWER WORLD,"And there are monsters in the dooryard, Centaurs,"
4772,THE LOWER WORLD,"Scyllas, of double shape, the beast of Lerna,"
4773,THE LOWER WORLD,"Hissing most horribly, Briareus,"
4774,THE LOWER WORLD,"The hundred-handed giant, a Chimaera"
4775,THE LOWER WORLD,"Whose armament is fire, Harpies, and Gorgons,"
4776,THE LOWER WORLD,A triple-bodied giant. In sudden panic
4777,THE LOWER WORLD,"Aeneas drew his sword, the edge held forward,"
4778,THE LOWER WORLD,"Ready to rush and flail, however blindly,"
4779,THE LOWER WORLD,"Save that his wise companion warned him, saying"
4780,THE LOWER WORLD,"They had no substance, they were only phantoms"
4781,THE LOWER WORLD,"Flitting about, illusions without body."
4782,THE LOWER WORLD,
4783,THE LOWER WORLD,"From here, the road turns off to Acheron,"
4784,THE LOWER WORLD,"River of Hell; here, thick with muddy whirling,"
4785,THE LOWER WORLD,"Cocytus boils with sand. Charon is here,"
4786,THE LOWER WORLD,"The guardian of these mingling waters, Charon,"
4787,THE LOWER WORLD,"Uncouth and filthy, on whose chin the hair"
4788,THE LOWER WORLD,"Is a tangled mat, whose eyes protrude, are burning,"
4789,THE LOWER WORLD,Whose dirty cloak is knotted at the shoulder.
4790,THE LOWER WORLD,"He poles a boat, tends to the sail, unaided,"
4791,THE LOWER WORLD,Ferrying bodies in his rust-hued vessel.
4792,THE LOWER WORLD,"Old, but a god’s senility is awful"
4793,THE LOWER WORLD,In its raw greenness. To the bank come thronging
4794,THE LOWER WORLD,"Mothers and men, bodies of great-souled heroes,"
4795,THE LOWER WORLD,"Their life-time over, boys, unwedded maidens,"
4796,THE LOWER WORLD,"Young men whose fathers saw their pyres burning,"
4797,THE LOWER WORLD,Thick as the forest leaves that fall in autumn
4798,THE LOWER WORLD,"With early frost, thick as the birds to landfall"
4799,THE LOWER WORLD,"From over the seas, when the chill of the year compels them"
4800,THE LOWER WORLD,"To sunlight. There they stand, a host, imploring"
4801,THE LOWER WORLD,"To be taken over first. Their hands, in longing,"
4802,THE LOWER WORLD,Reach out for the farther shore. But the gloomy boatman
4803,THE LOWER WORLD,"Makes choice among them, taking some, and keeping"
4804,THE LOWER WORLD,"Others far back from the stream’s edge. Aeneas,"
4805,THE LOWER WORLD,"Wondering, asks the Sibyl, “Why the crowding?"
4806,THE LOWER WORLD,What are the spirits seeking? What distinction
4807,THE LOWER WORLD,"Brings some across the livid stream, while others"
4808,THE LOWER WORLD,"Stay on the farther bank?” She answers, briefly:"
4809,THE LOWER WORLD,"“Son of Anchises, this is the awful river,"
4810,THE LOWER WORLD,"The Styx, by which the gods take oath; the boatman"
4811,THE LOWER WORLD,"Charon; those he takes with him are the buried,"
4812,THE LOWER WORLD,"Those he rejects, whose luck is out, the graveless."
4813,THE LOWER WORLD,It is not permitted him to take them over
4814,THE LOWER WORLD,The dreadful banks and hoarse-resounding waters
4815,THE LOWER WORLD,Till earth is cast upon their bones. They haunt
4816,THE LOWER WORLD,These shores a hundred restless years of waiting
4817,THE LOWER WORLD,Before they end postponement of the crossing.”
4818,THE LOWER WORLD,"Aeneas paused, in thoughtful mood, with pity"
4819,THE LOWER WORLD,"Over their lot’s unevenness; and saw there,"
4820,THE LOWER WORLD,"Wanting the honor given the dead, and grieving,"
4821,THE LOWER WORLD,"Leucaspis, and Orontes, the Lycian captain,"
4822,THE LOWER WORLD,"Who had sailed from Troy across the stormy waters,"
4823,THE LOWER WORLD,"And drowned off Africa, with crew and vessel,"
4824,THE LOWER WORLD,"And there was Palinurus, once his pilot,"
4825,THE LOWER WORLD,"Who, not so long ago, had been swept over,"
4826,THE LOWER WORLD,Watching the stars on the journey north from Carthage.
4827,THE LOWER WORLD,"The murk was thick; Aeneas hardly knew him,"
4828,THE LOWER WORLD,"Sorrowful in that darkness, but made question:"
4829,THE LOWER WORLD,"“What god, O Palinurus, took you from us?"
4830,THE LOWER WORLD,Who drowned you in the deep? Tell me. Apollo
4831,THE LOWER WORLD,"Never before was false, and yet he told me"
4832,THE LOWER WORLD,"You would be safe across the seas, and come"
4833,THE LOWER WORLD,Unharmed to Italy; what kind of promise
4834,THE LOWER WORLD,"Was this, to fool me with?” But Palinurus"
4835,THE LOWER WORLD,"Gave him assurance:--“It was no god who drowned me,"
4836,THE LOWER WORLD,"No falsehood on Apollo’s part, my captain,"
4837,THE LOWER WORLD,"But as I clung to the tiller, holding fast"
4838,THE LOWER WORLD,"To keep the course, as I should do, I felt it"
4839,THE LOWER WORLD,"Wrenched from the ship, and I fell with it, headlong."
4840,THE LOWER WORLD,"By those rough seas I swear, I had less fear"
4841,THE LOWER WORLD,"On my account than for the ship, with rudder"
4842,THE LOWER WORLD,"And helmsman overboard, to drift at the mercy"
4843,THE LOWER WORLD,"Of rising seas. Three nights I rode the waters,"
4844,THE LOWER WORLD,"Three nights of storm, and from the crest of a wave,"
4845,THE LOWER WORLD,"On the fourth morning, sighted Italy,"
4846,THE LOWER WORLD,"I was swimming to land, I had almost reached it, heavy"
4847,THE LOWER WORLD,In soaking garments; my cramped fingers struggled
4848,THE LOWER WORLD,"To grasp the top of the rock, when barbarous people,"
4849,THE LOWER WORLD,"Ignorant men, mistaking me for booty,"
4850,THE LOWER WORLD,"Struck me with swords; waves hold me now, or winds"
4851,THE LOWER WORLD,"Roll me along the shore. By the light of heaven,"
4852,THE LOWER WORLD,"The lovely air, I beg you, by your father,"
4853,THE LOWER WORLD,"Your hope of young Iulus, bring me rescue"
4854,THE LOWER WORLD,"Out of these evils, my unconquered leader!"
4855,THE LOWER WORLD,Cast over my body earth--you have the power--
4856,THE LOWER WORLD,"Return to Velia’s harbor,--or there may be"
4857,THE LOWER WORLD,"Some other way--your mother is a goddess,"
4858,THE LOWER WORLD,"Else how would you be crossing this great river,"
4859,THE LOWER WORLD,"This Stygian swamp?--help a poor fellow, take me"
4860,THE LOWER WORLD,"Over the water with you, give a dead man"
4861,THE LOWER WORLD,At least a place to rest in.” But the Sibyl
4862,THE LOWER WORLD,"Broke in upon him sternly:--“Palinurus,"
4863,THE LOWER WORLD,"Whence comes this mad desire? No man, unburied,"
4864,THE LOWER WORLD,"May see the Stygian waters, or Cocytus,"
4865,THE LOWER WORLD,The Furies’ dreadful river; no man may come
4866,THE LOWER WORLD,Unbidden to this bank. Give up the hope
4867,THE LOWER WORLD,"That fate is changed by praying, but hear this,"
4868,THE LOWER WORLD,A little comfort in your harsh misfortune:
4869,THE LOWER WORLD,"Those neighboring people will make expiation,"
4870,THE LOWER WORLD,"Driven by signs from heaven, through their cities"
4871,THE LOWER WORLD,"And through their countryside; they will build a tomb,"
4872,THE LOWER WORLD,"Thereto bring offerings yearly, and the place"
4873,THE LOWER WORLD,"Shall take its name from you, Cape Palinurus.”"
4874,THE LOWER WORLD,"So he was comforted a little, finding"
4875,THE LOWER WORLD,Some happiness in the promise.
4876,THE LOWER WORLD,
4877,THE LOWER WORLD,"And they went on,"
4878,THE LOWER WORLD,"Nearing the river, and from the stream the boatman"
4879,THE LOWER WORLD,"Beheld them cross the silent forest, nearer,"
4880,THE LOWER WORLD,Turning their footsteps toward the bank. He challenged:--
4881,THE LOWER WORLD,"“Whoever you are, O man in armor, coming"
4882,THE LOWER WORLD,"In this direction, halt where you are, and tell me"
4883,THE LOWER WORLD,The reason why you come. This is the region
4884,THE LOWER WORLD,"Of shadows, and of Sleep and drowsy Night;"
4885,THE LOWER WORLD,I am not allowed to carry living bodies
4886,THE LOWER WORLD,In the Stygian boat; and I must say I was sorry
4887,THE LOWER WORLD,I ever accepted Hercules and Theseus
4888,THE LOWER WORLD,"And Pirithous, and rowed them over the lake,"
4889,THE LOWER WORLD,Though they were sons of gods and great in courage.
4890,THE LOWER WORLD,"One of them dared to drag the guard of Hell,"
4891,THE LOWER WORLD,"Enchained, from Pluto’s throne, shaking in terror,"
4892,THE LOWER WORLD,The others to snatch our queen from Pluto’s chamber.”
4893,THE LOWER WORLD,The Sibyl answered briefly: “No such cunning
4894,THE LOWER WORLD,Is plotted here; our weapons bring no danger.
4895,THE LOWER WORLD,Be undisturbed: the hell-hound in his cavern
4896,THE LOWER WORLD,"May bark forever, to keep the bloodless shadows"
4897,THE LOWER WORLD,"Frightened away from trespass; Proserpine,"
4898,THE LOWER WORLD,"Untouched, in pureness guard her uncle’s threshold."
4899,THE LOWER WORLD,"Trojan Aeneas, a man renowned for goodness,"
4900,THE LOWER WORLD,"Renowned for nerve in battle, is descending"
4901,THE LOWER WORLD,To the lowest shades; he comes to find his father.
4902,THE LOWER WORLD,"If such devotion has no meaning to you,"
4903,THE LOWER WORLD,"Look on this branch at least, and recognize it!”"
4904,THE LOWER WORLD,And with the word she drew from under her mantle
4905,THE LOWER WORLD,The golden bough; his swollen wrath subsided.
4906,THE LOWER WORLD,"No more was said; he saw the bough, and marvelled"
4907,THE LOWER WORLD,"At the holy gift, so long unseen; came sculling"
4908,THE LOWER WORLD,"The dark-blue boat to the shore, and drove the spirits,"
4909,THE LOWER WORLD,"Lining the thwarts, ashore, and cleared the gangway,"
4910,THE LOWER WORLD,And took Aeneas aboard; as that big man
4911,THE LOWER WORLD,"Stepped in, the leaky skiff groaned under the weight,"
4912,THE LOWER WORLD,"And the strained seams let in the muddy water,"
4913,THE LOWER WORLD,"But they made the crossing safely, seer and soldier,"
4914,THE LOWER WORLD,"To the far margin, colorless and shapeless,"
4915,THE LOWER WORLD,Grey sedge and dark-brown ooze. They heard the baying
4916,THE LOWER WORLD,"Of Cerberus, that great hound, in his cavern crouching,"
4917,THE LOWER WORLD,"Making the shore resound, as all three throats"
4918,THE LOWER WORLD,Belled horribly; and serpents rose and bristled
4919,THE LOWER WORLD,Along the triple neck. The priestess threw him
4920,THE LOWER WORLD,A sop with honey and drugged meal; he opened
4921,THE LOWER WORLD,"The ravenous throat, gulped, and subsided, filling"
4922,THE LOWER WORLD,"The den with his huge bulk. Aeneas, crossing,"
4923,THE LOWER WORLD,Passed on beyond the bank of the dread river
4924,THE LOWER WORLD,Whence none return.
4925,THE LOWER WORLD,
4926,THE LOWER WORLD,A wailing of thin voices
4927,THE LOWER WORLD,"Came to their ears, the souls of infants crying,"
4928,THE LOWER WORLD,Those whom the day of darkness took from the breast
4929,THE LOWER WORLD,Before their share of living. And there were many
4930,THE LOWER WORLD,Whom some false sentence brought to death. Here Minos
4931,THE LOWER WORLD,Judges them once again; a silent jury
4932,THE LOWER WORLD,"Reviews the evidence. And there are others,"
4933,THE LOWER WORLD,"Guilty of nothing, but who hated living,"
4934,THE LOWER WORLD,"The suicides. How gladly, now, they would suffer"
4935,THE LOWER WORLD,"Poverty, hardship, in the world of light!"
4936,THE LOWER WORLD,But this is not permitted; they are bound
4937,THE LOWER WORLD,Nine times around by the black unlovely river;
4938,THE LOWER WORLD,Styx holds them fast.
4939,THE LOWER WORLD,
4940,THE LOWER WORLD,"They came to the Fields of Mourning,"
4941,THE LOWER WORLD,"So-called, where those whom cruel love had wasted"
4942,THE LOWER WORLD,"Hid in secluded pathways, under myrtle,"
4943,THE LOWER WORLD,"And even in death were anxious. Procris, Phaedra,"
4944,THE LOWER WORLD,"Eriphyle, displaying wounds her son"
4945,THE LOWER WORLD,"Had given her, Caeneus, Laodamia,"
4946,THE LOWER WORLD,"Caeneus, a young man once, and now again"
4947,THE LOWER WORLD,"A young man, after having been a woman."
4948,THE LOWER WORLD,"And here, new come from her own wound, was Dido,"
4949,THE LOWER WORLD,"Wandering in the wood. The Trojan hero,"
4950,THE LOWER WORLD,"Standing near by, saw her, or thought he saw her,"
4951,THE LOWER WORLD,"Dim in the shadows, like the slender crescent"
4952,THE LOWER WORLD,"Of moon when cloud drifts over. Weeping, he greets her:--"
4953,THE LOWER WORLD,"“Unhappy Dido, so they told me truly"
4954,THE LOWER WORLD,That your own hand had brought you death. Was I--
4955,THE LOWER WORLD,"Alas!--the cause? I swear by all the stars,"
4956,THE LOWER WORLD,"By the world above, by everything held sacred"
4957,THE LOWER WORLD,"Here under the earth, unwillingly, O queen,"
4958,THE LOWER WORLD,"I left your kingdom. But the gods’ commands,"
4959,THE LOWER WORLD,"Driving me now through these forsaken places,"
4960,THE LOWER WORLD,"This utter night, compelled me on. I could not"
4961,THE LOWER WORLD,Believe my loss would cause so great a sorrow.
4962,THE LOWER WORLD,"Linger a moment, do not leave me; whither,"
4963,THE LOWER WORLD,"Whom, are you fleeing? I am permitted only"
4964,THE LOWER WORLD,This last word with you.”
4965,THE LOWER WORLD,
4966,THE LOWER WORLD,"But the queen, unmoving"
4967,THE LOWER WORLD,"As flint or marble, turned away, her eyes"
4968,THE LOWER WORLD,"Fixed on the ground: the tears were vain, the words,"
4969,THE LOWER WORLD,"Meant to be soothing, foolish; she turned away,"
4970,THE LOWER WORLD,"His enemy forever, to the shadows"
4971,THE LOWER WORLD,"Where Sychaeus, her former husband, took her"
4972,THE LOWER WORLD,"With love for love, and sorrow for her sorrow."
4973,THE LOWER WORLD,"And still Aeneas wept for her, being troubled"
4974,THE LOWER WORLD,By the injustice of her doom; his pity
4975,THE LOWER WORLD,Followed her going.
4976,THE LOWER WORLD,
4977,THE LOWER WORLD,They went on. They came
4978,THE LOWER WORLD,"To the farthest fields, whose tenants are the warriors,"
4979,THE LOWER WORLD,"Illustrious throng. Here Tydeus came to meet him,"
4980,THE LOWER WORLD,"Parthenopaeus came, and pale Adrastus,"
4981,THE LOWER WORLD,"A fighter’s ghost, and many, many others,"
4982,THE LOWER WORLD,"Mourned in the world above, and doomed in battle,"
4983,THE LOWER WORLD,"Leaders of Troy, in long array; Aeneas"
4984,THE LOWER WORLD,"Sighed as he saw them: Medon; Polyboetes,"
4985,THE LOWER WORLD,The priest of Ceres; Glaucus; and Idaeus
4986,THE LOWER WORLD,"Still keeping arms and chariot; three brothers,"
4987,THE LOWER WORLD,Antenor’s sons; Thersilochus; a host
4988,THE LOWER WORLD,"To right and left of him, and when they see him,"
4989,THE LOWER WORLD,"One sight is not enough; they crowd around him,"
4990,THE LOWER WORLD,"Linger, and ask the reasons for his coming."
4991,THE LOWER WORLD,"But Agamemnon’s men, the Greek battalions,"
4992,THE LOWER WORLD,"Seeing him there, and his arms in shadow gleaming,"
4993,THE LOWER WORLD,"Tremble in panic, turn to flee for refuge,"
4994,THE LOWER WORLD,"As once they used to, toward their ships, but where"
4995,THE LOWER WORLD,"Are the ships now? They try to shout, in terror;"
4996,THE LOWER WORLD,But only a thin and piping treble issues
4997,THE LOWER WORLD,"To mock their mouths, wide-open."
4998,THE LOWER WORLD,
4999,THE LOWER WORLD,One he knew
5000,THE LOWER WORLD,"Was here, Deiphobus, a son of Priam,"
5001,THE LOWER WORLD,"With his whole body mangled, and his features"
5002,THE LOWER WORLD,"Cruelly slashed, and both hands cut, and ears"
5003,THE LOWER WORLD,"Torn from his temples, and his nostrils slit"
5004,THE LOWER WORLD,"By shameful wounds. Aeneas hardly knew him,"
5005,THE LOWER WORLD,"Shivering there, and doing his best to hide"
5006,THE LOWER WORLD,"His marks of punishment; unhailed, he hailed him:--"
5007,THE LOWER WORLD,"“Deiphobus, great warrior, son of Teucer,"
5008,THE LOWER WORLD,Whose cruel punishment was this? Whose license
5009,THE LOWER WORLD,"Abused you so? I heard, it seems, a story"
5010,THE LOWER WORLD,"Of that last night, how you had fallen, weary"
5011,THE LOWER WORLD,"With killing Greeks at last; I built a tomb,"
5012,THE LOWER WORLD,"Although no body lay there, in your honor,"
5013,THE LOWER WORLD,"Three times I cried, aloud, over your spirit,"
5014,THE LOWER WORLD,"Where now your name and arms keep guard. I could not,"
5015,THE LOWER WORLD,"Leaving my country, find my friend, to give him"
5016,THE LOWER WORLD,Proper interment in the earth he came from.”
5017,THE LOWER WORLD,"And Priam’s son replied:--“Nothing, dear comrade,"
5018,THE LOWER WORLD,Was left undone; the dead man’s shade was given
5019,THE LOWER WORLD,All ceremony due. It was my own fortune
5020,THE LOWER WORLD,And a Spartan woman’s deadliness that sunk me
5021,THE LOWER WORLD,Under these evils; she it was who left me
5022,THE LOWER WORLD,These souvenirs. You know how falsely happy
5023,THE LOWER WORLD,We were on that last night; I need not tell you.
5024,THE LOWER WORLD,"When that dread horse came leaping over our walls,"
5025,THE LOWER WORLD,"Pregnant with soldiery, she led the dancing,"
5026,THE LOWER WORLD,"A solemn rite, she called it, with Trojan women"
5027,THE LOWER WORLD,Screaming their bacchanals; she raised the torches
5028,THE LOWER WORLD,High on the citadel; she called the Greeks.
5029,THE LOWER WORLD,"Then--I was worn with trouble, drugged in slumber,"
5030,THE LOWER WORLD,"Resting in our ill-omened bridal chamber,"
5031,THE LOWER WORLD,With sleep as deep and sweet as death upon me--
5032,THE LOWER WORLD,"Then she, that paragon of helpmates, deftly"
5033,THE LOWER WORLD,"Moved all the weapons from the house; my sword,"
5034,THE LOWER WORLD,"Even, she stole from underneath my pillow,"
5035,THE LOWER WORLD,"Opened the door, and called in Menelaus,"
5036,THE LOWER WORLD,"Hoping, no doubt, to please her loving husband,"
5037,THE LOWER WORLD,To win forgetfulness of her old sinning.
5038,THE LOWER WORLD,"It is quickly told: they broke into the chamber,"
5039,THE LOWER WORLD,"The two of them, and with them, as accomplice,"
5040,THE LOWER WORLD,"Ulysses came, the crime-contriving bastard."
5041,THE LOWER WORLD,"O gods, pay back the Greeks; grant the petition"
5042,THE LOWER WORLD,"If goodness asks for vengeance! But you, Aeneas,"
5043,THE LOWER WORLD,A living man--what chance has brought you here?
5044,THE LOWER WORLD,"Vagrant of ocean, god-inspired,--which are you?"
5045,THE LOWER WORLD,"What chance has worn you down, to come, in sadness,"
5046,THE LOWER WORLD,To these confusing sunless dwelling-places?”
5047,THE LOWER WORLD,
5048,THE LOWER WORLD,"While they were talking, Aurora’s rosy car"
5049,THE LOWER WORLD,Had halfway crossed the heaven; all their time
5050,THE LOWER WORLD,"Might have been spent in converse, but the Sibyl"
5051,THE LOWER WORLD,"Hurried them forward:--“Night comes on, Aeneas;"
5052,THE LOWER WORLD,"We waste the hours with tears. We are at the cross-road,"
5053,THE LOWER WORLD,"Now; here we turn to the right, where the pathway leads"
5054,THE LOWER WORLD,"On to Elysium, under Pluto’s ramparts."
5055,THE LOWER WORLD,"Leftward is Tartarus, and retribution,"
5056,THE LOWER WORLD,"The terminal of the wicked, and their dungeon.”"
5057,THE LOWER WORLD,"Deiphobus left them, saying, “O great priestess,"
5058,THE LOWER WORLD,Do not be angry with me; I am going;
5059,THE LOWER WORLD,I shall not fail the roll-call of the shadows.
5060,THE LOWER WORLD,"Pride of our race, go on; may better fortune"
5061,THE LOWER WORLD,"Attend you!” and, upon the word, he vanished."
5062,THE LOWER WORLD,
5063,THE LOWER WORLD,"As he looked back, Aeneas saw, to his left,"
5064,THE LOWER WORLD,"Wide walls beneath a cliff, a triple rampart,"
5065,THE LOWER WORLD,"A river running fire, Phlegethon’s torrent,"
5066,THE LOWER WORLD,"Rocks roaring in its course, a gate, tremendous,"
5067,THE LOWER WORLD,"Pillars of adamant, a tower of iron,"
5068,THE LOWER WORLD,"Too strong for men, too strong for even gods"
5069,THE LOWER WORLD,"To batter down in warfare, and behind them"
5070,THE LOWER WORLD,"A Fury, sentinel in bloody garments,"
5071,THE LOWER WORLD,"Always on watch, by day, by night. He heard"
5072,THE LOWER WORLD,"Sobbing and groaning there, the crack of the lash,"
5073,THE LOWER WORLD,"The clank of iron, the sound of dragging shackles."
5074,THE LOWER WORLD,"The noise was terrible; Aeneas halted,"
5075,THE LOWER WORLD,"Asking, “What forms of crime are these, O maiden?"
5076,THE LOWER WORLD,"What harrying punishment, what horrible outcry?”"
5077,THE LOWER WORLD,"She answered:--“O great leader of the Trojans,"
5078,THE LOWER WORLD,I have never crossed that threshold of the wicked;
5079,THE LOWER WORLD,"No pure soul is permitted entrance thither,"
5080,THE LOWER WORLD,"But Hecate, by whose order I was given"
5081,THE LOWER WORLD,"Charge of Avernus’ groves, my guide, my teacher,"
5082,THE LOWER WORLD,Told me how gods exact the toll of vengeance.
5083,THE LOWER WORLD,"The monarch here, merciless Rhadamanthus,"
5084,THE LOWER WORLD,"Punishes guilt, and hears confession; he forces"
5085,THE LOWER WORLD,"Acknowledgment of crime; no man in the world,"
5086,THE LOWER WORLD,"No matter how cleverly he hides his evil,"
5087,THE LOWER WORLD,"No matter how much he smiles at his own slyness,"
5088,THE LOWER WORLD,Can fend atonement off; the hour of death
5089,THE LOWER WORLD,"Begins his sentence. Tisiphone, the Fury,"
5090,THE LOWER WORLD,Leaps at the guilty with her scourge; her serpents
5091,THE LOWER WORLD,Are whips of menace as she calls her sisters.
5092,THE LOWER WORLD,"Imagine the gates, on jarring hinge, rasp open,"
5093,THE LOWER WORLD,"You would see her in the doorway, a shape, a sentry,"
5094,THE LOWER WORLD,"Savage, implacable. Beyond, still fiercer,"
5095,THE LOWER WORLD,The monstrous Hydra dwells; her fifty throats
5096,THE LOWER WORLD,"Are black, and open wide, and Tartarus"
5097,THE LOWER WORLD,"Is black, and open wide, and it goes down"
5098,THE LOWER WORLD,"To darkness, sheer deep down, and twice the distance"
5099,THE LOWER WORLD,That earth is from Olympus. At the bottom
5100,THE LOWER WORLD,"The Titans crawl, Earth’s oldest breed, hurled under"
5101,THE LOWER WORLD,"By thunderbolts; here lie the giant twins,"
5102,THE LOWER WORLD,"Aloeus’ sons, who laid their hands on heaven"
5103,THE LOWER WORLD,And tried to pull down Jove; Salmoneus here
5104,THE LOWER WORLD,"Atones for high presumption,--it was he"
5105,THE LOWER WORLD,"Who aped Jove’s noise and fire, wheeling his horses"
5106,THE LOWER WORLD,"Triumphant through his city in Elis, cheering"
5107,THE LOWER WORLD,"And shaking the torch, and claiming divine homage,"
5108,THE LOWER WORLD,"The arrogant fool, to think his brass was lightning,"
5109,THE LOWER WORLD,His horny-footed horses beat out thunder!
5110,THE LOWER WORLD,"Jove showed him what real thunder was, what lightning"
5111,THE LOWER WORLD,"Spoke from immortal cloud, what whirlwind fury"
5112,THE LOWER WORLD,Came sweeping from the heaven to overtake him.
5113,THE LOWER WORLD,"Here Tityos, Earth’s giant son, lies sprawling"
5114,THE LOWER WORLD,"Over nine acres, with a monstrous vulture"
5115,THE LOWER WORLD,"Gnawing, with crooked beak, vitals and liver"
5116,THE LOWER WORLD,"That grow as they are eaten; eternal anguish,"
5117,THE LOWER WORLD,Eternal feast. Over another hangs
5118,THE LOWER WORLD,"A rock, about to fall; and there are tables"
5119,THE LOWER WORLD,"Set for a banquet, gold with royal splendor,"
5120,THE LOWER WORLD,"But if a hand goes out to touch the viands,"
5121,THE LOWER WORLD,The Fury drives it back with fire and yelling.
5122,THE LOWER WORLD,"Why name them all, Pirithous, the Lapiths,"
5123,THE LOWER WORLD,Ixion? The roll of crime would take forever.
5124,THE LOWER WORLD,"Whoever, in his lifetime, hated his brother,"
5125,THE LOWER WORLD,Or struck his father down; whoever cheated
5126,THE LOWER WORLD,"A client, or was miserly--how many"
5127,THE LOWER WORLD,Of these there seem to be!--whoever went
5128,THE LOWER WORLD,"To treasonable war, or broke a promise"
5129,THE LOWER WORLD,"Made to his lord, whoever perished, slain"
5130,THE LOWER WORLD,"Over adultery, all these, walled in,"
5131,THE LOWER WORLD,Wait here their punishment. Seek not to know
5132,THE LOWER WORLD,"Too much about their doom. The stone is rolled,"
5133,THE LOWER WORLD,The wheel keeps turning; Theseus forever
5134,THE LOWER WORLD,"Sits in dejection; Phlegyas, accursed,"
5135,THE LOWER WORLD,"Cries through the halls forever: _Being warned,"
5136,THE LOWER WORLD,Learn justice; reverence the gods!_ The man
5137,THE LOWER WORLD,Who sold his country is here in hell; the man
5138,THE LOWER WORLD,Who altered laws for money; and a father
5139,THE LOWER WORLD,"Who knew his daughter’s bed. All of them dared,"
5140,THE LOWER WORLD,"And more than dared, achieved, unspeakable"
5141,THE LOWER WORLD,"Ambitions. If I had a hundred tongues,"
5142,THE LOWER WORLD,"A hundred iron throats, I could not tell"
5143,THE LOWER WORLD,The fullness of their crime and punishment.”
5144,THE LOWER WORLD,"And then she added:--“Come: resume the journey,"
5145,THE LOWER WORLD,Fulfill the mission; let us hurry onward.
5146,THE LOWER WORLD,"I see the walls the Cyclops made, the portals"
5147,THE LOWER WORLD,"Under the archway, where, the orders tell us,"
5148,THE LOWER WORLD,Our tribute must be set.” They went together
5149,THE LOWER WORLD,"Through the way’s darkness, came to the doors, and halted,"
5150,THE LOWER WORLD,"And at the entrance Aeneas, having sprinkled"
5151,THE LOWER WORLD,"His body with fresh water, placed the bough"
5152,THE LOWER WORLD,Golden before the threshold. The will of the goddess
5153,THE LOWER WORLD,"Had been performed, the proper task completed."
5154,THE LOWER WORLD,
5155,THE LOWER WORLD,"They came to happy places, the joyful dwelling,"
5156,THE LOWER WORLD,The lovely greenery of the groves of the blessèd.
5157,THE LOWER WORLD,"Here ampler air invests the fields with light,"
5158,THE LOWER WORLD,"Rose-colored, with familiar stars and sun."
5159,THE LOWER WORLD,Some grapple on the grassy wrestling-ground
5160,THE LOWER WORLD,"In exercise and sport, and some are dancing,"
5161,THE LOWER WORLD,And others singing; in his trailing robe
5162,THE LOWER WORLD,Orpheus strums the lyre; the seven clear notes
5163,THE LOWER WORLD,"Accompany the dance, the song. And heroes"
5164,THE LOWER WORLD,"Are there, great-souled, born in the happier years,"
5165,THE LOWER WORLD,"Ilus, Assaracus; the city’s founder,"
5166,THE LOWER WORLD,"Prince Dardanus. Far off, Aeneas wonders,"
5167,THE LOWER WORLD,"Seeing the phantom arms, the chariots,"
5168,THE LOWER WORLD,"The spears fixed in the ground, the chargers browsing,"
5169,THE LOWER WORLD,"Unharnessed, over the plain. Whatever, living,"
5170,THE LOWER WORLD,"The men delighted in, whatever pleasure"
5171,THE LOWER WORLD,"Was theirs in horse and chariot, still holds them"
5172,THE LOWER WORLD,"Here under the world. To right and left, they banquet"
5173,THE LOWER WORLD,"In the green meadows, and a joyful chorus"
5174,THE LOWER WORLD,"Rises through groves of laurel, whence the river"
5175,THE LOWER WORLD,Runs to the upper world. The band of heroes
5176,THE LOWER WORLD,"Dwell here, all those whose mortal wounds were suffered"
5177,THE LOWER WORLD,"In fighting for the fatherland; and poets,"
5178,THE LOWER WORLD,"The good, the pure, the worthy of Apollo;"
5179,THE LOWER WORLD,Those who discovered truth and made life nobler;
5180,THE LOWER WORLD,"Those who served others--all, with snowy fillets"
5181,THE LOWER WORLD,"Binding their temples, throng the lovely valley."
5182,THE LOWER WORLD,"And these the Sibyl questioned, most of all"
5183,THE LOWER WORLD,"Musaeus, for he towered above the center"
5184,THE LOWER WORLD,"Of that great throng:--“O happy souls, O poet,"
5185,THE LOWER WORLD,Where does Anchises dwell? For him we come here.
5186,THE LOWER WORLD,For him we have traversed Erebus’ great rivers.”
5187,THE LOWER WORLD,"And he replied:--“It is all our home, the shady"
5188,THE LOWER WORLD,"Groves, and the streaming meadows, and the softness"
5189,THE LOWER WORLD,Along the river-banks. No fixed abode
5190,THE LOWER WORLD,"Is ours at all; but if it is your pleasure,"
5191,THE LOWER WORLD,Cross over the ridge with me; I will guide you there
5192,THE LOWER WORLD,By easy going.” And so Musaeus led them
5193,THE LOWER WORLD,"And from the summit showed them fields, all shining,"
5194,THE LOWER WORLD,And they went on over and down.
5195,THE LOWER WORLD,
5196,THE LOWER WORLD,"Deep in a valley of green, father Anchises"
5197,THE LOWER WORLD,"Was watching, with deep earnestness, the spirits"
5198,THE LOWER WORLD,"Whose destiny was light, and counting them over,"
5199,THE LOWER WORLD,"All of his race to come, his dear descendants,"
5200,THE LOWER WORLD,"Their fates and fortunes and their works and ways,"
5201,THE LOWER WORLD,And as he saw Aeneas coming toward him
5202,THE LOWER WORLD,"Over the meadow, his hands reached out with yearning,"
5203,THE LOWER WORLD,"He was moved to tears, and called:--“At last, my son,--"
5204,THE LOWER WORLD,"Have you really come, at last? and the long road nothing"
5205,THE LOWER WORLD,"To a son who loves his father? Do I, truly,"
5206,THE LOWER WORLD,"See you, and hear your voice? I was thinking so,"
5207,THE LOWER WORLD,"I was hoping so, I was counting off the days,"
5208,THE LOWER WORLD,And I was right about it. O my son!
5209,THE LOWER WORLD,"What a long journey, over land and water,"
5210,THE LOWER WORLD,Yours must have been! What buffeting of danger!
5211,THE LOWER WORLD,"I feared, so much, the Libyan realm would hurt you.”"
5212,THE LOWER WORLD,"And his son answered:--“It was your spirit, father,"
5213,THE LOWER WORLD,"Your sorrowful shade, so often met, that led me"
5214,THE LOWER WORLD,"To find these portals. The ships ride safe at anchor,"
5215,THE LOWER WORLD,"Safe in the Tuscan sea. Embrace me, father;"
5216,THE LOWER WORLD,Let hand join hand in love; do not forsake me.”
5217,THE LOWER WORLD,"And as he spoke, the tears streamed down. Three times"
5218,THE LOWER WORLD,"He reached out toward him, and three times the image"
5219,THE LOWER WORLD,Fled like the breath of the wind or a dream on wings.
5220,THE LOWER WORLD,
5221,THE LOWER WORLD,"He saw, in a far valley, a separate grove"
5222,THE LOWER WORLD,"Where the woods stir and rustle, and a river,"
5223,THE LOWER WORLD,"The Lethe, gliding past the peaceful places,"
5224,THE LOWER WORLD,"And tribes of people thronging, hovering over,"
5225,THE LOWER WORLD,Innumerable as the bees in summer
5226,THE LOWER WORLD,"Working the bright-hued flowers, and the shining"
5227,THE LOWER WORLD,"Of the white lilies, murmuring and humming."
5228,THE LOWER WORLD,"Aeneas, filled with wonder, asks the reason"
5229,THE LOWER WORLD,"For what he does not know, who are the people"
5230,THE LOWER WORLD,"In such a host, and to what river coming?"
5231,THE LOWER WORLD,"Anchises answers:--“These are spirits, ready"
5232,THE LOWER WORLD,Once more for life; they drink of Lethe’s water
5233,THE LOWER WORLD,The soothing potion of forgetfulness.
5234,THE LOWER WORLD,"I have longed, for long, to show them to you, name them,"
5235,THE LOWER WORLD,"Our children’s children; Italy discovered,"
5236,THE LOWER WORLD,"So much the greater happiness, my son.”"
5237,THE LOWER WORLD,"“But, O my father, is it thinkable"
5238,THE LOWER WORLD,"That souls would leave this blessedness, be willing"
5239,THE LOWER WORLD,"A second time to bear the sluggish body,"
5240,THE LOWER WORLD,"Trade Paradise for earth? Alas, poor wretches,"
5241,THE LOWER WORLD,Why such a mad desire for light?” Anchises
5242,THE LOWER WORLD,"Gives detailed answer: “First, my son, a spirit"
5243,THE LOWER WORLD,"Sustains all matter, heaven and earth and ocean,"
5244,THE LOWER WORLD,"The moon, the stars; mind quickens mass, and moves it."
5245,THE LOWER WORLD,"Hence comes the race of man, of beast, of wingèd"
5246,THE LOWER WORLD,"Creatures of air, of the strange shapes which ocean"
5247,THE LOWER WORLD,Bears down below his mottled marble surface.
5248,THE LOWER WORLD,All these are blessed with energy from heaven;
5249,THE LOWER WORLD,"The seed of life is a spark of fire, but the body"
5250,THE LOWER WORLD,"A clod of earth, a clog, a mortal burden."
5251,THE LOWER WORLD,"Hence humans fear, desire, grieve, and are joyful,"
5252,THE LOWER WORLD,"And even when life is over, all the evil"
5253,THE LOWER WORLD,"Ingrained so long, the adulterated mixture,"
5254,THE LOWER WORLD,The plagues and pestilences of the body
5255,THE LOWER WORLD,"Remain, persist. So there must be a cleansing,"
5256,THE LOWER WORLD,"By penalty, by punishment, by fire,"
5257,THE LOWER WORLD,"By sweep of wind, by water’s absolution,"
5258,THE LOWER WORLD,Before the guilt is gone. Each of us suffers
5259,THE LOWER WORLD,His own peculiar ghost. But the day comes
5260,THE LOWER WORLD,"When we are sent through wide Elysium,"
5261,THE LOWER WORLD,"The Fields of the Blessed, a few of us, to linger"
5262,THE LOWER WORLD,"Until the turn of time, the wheel of ages,"
5263,THE LOWER WORLD,"Wears off the taint, and leaves the core of spirit"
5264,THE LOWER WORLD,"Pure sense, pure flame. A thousand years pass over"
5265,THE LOWER WORLD,And the god calls the countless host to Lethe
5266,THE LOWER WORLD,"Where memory is annulled, and souls are willing"
5267,THE LOWER WORLD,Once more to enter into mortal bodies.”
5268,THE LOWER WORLD,
5269,THE LOWER WORLD,The discourse ended; the father drew his son
5270,THE LOWER WORLD,"And his companion toward the hum, the center"
5271,THE LOWER WORLD,Of the full host; they came to rising ground
5272,THE LOWER WORLD,"Where all the long array was visible,"
5273,THE LOWER WORLD,"Anchises watching, noting, every comer."
5274,THE LOWER WORLD,"“Glory to come, my son, illustrious spirits"
5275,THE LOWER WORLD,"Of Dardan lineage, Italian offspring,"
5276,THE LOWER WORLD,"Heirs of our name, begetters of our future!"
5277,THE LOWER WORLD,These I will name for you and tell our fortunes:
5278,THE LOWER WORLD,"First, leaning on a headless spear, and standing"
5279,THE LOWER WORLD,"Nearest the light, that youth, the first to rise"
5280,THE LOWER WORLD,"To the world above, is Silvius; his name"
5281,THE LOWER WORLD,Is Alban; in his veins Italian blood
5282,THE LOWER WORLD,Will run with Trojan; he will be the son
5283,THE LOWER WORLD,"Of your late age; Lavinia will bear him,"
5284,THE LOWER WORLD,A king and sire of kings; from him our race
5285,THE LOWER WORLD,"Will rule in Alba Longa. Near him, Procas,"
5286,THE LOWER WORLD,"A glory to the Trojan race; and Capys,"
5287,THE LOWER WORLD,"And Numitor, and Silvius Aeneas,"
5288,THE LOWER WORLD,"Resembling you in name, in arms, in goodness,"
5289,THE LOWER WORLD,If ever he wins the Alban kingdom over.
5290,THE LOWER WORLD,"What fine young men they are! What strength, what prowess!"
5291,THE LOWER WORLD,The civic oak already shades their foreheads.
5292,THE LOWER WORLD,"These will found cities, Gabii, Fidenae,"
5293,THE LOWER WORLD,Nomentum; they will crown the hills with towers
5294,THE LOWER WORLD,"Above Collatia, Inuus fortress, Bola,"
5295,THE LOWER WORLD,"Cora, all names to be, thus far ungiven."
5296,THE LOWER WORLD,
5297,THE LOWER WORLD,“And there will be a son of Mars; his mother
5298,THE LOWER WORLD,"Is Ilia, and his name is Romulus,"
5299,THE LOWER WORLD,Assaracus’ descendant. On his helmet
5300,THE LOWER WORLD,"See, even now, twin plumes; his father’s honor"
5301,THE LOWER WORLD,Confers distinction on him for the world.
5302,THE LOWER WORLD,"Under his auspices Rome, that glorious city,"
5303,THE LOWER WORLD,"Will bound her power by earth, her pride by heaven,"
5304,THE LOWER WORLD,"Happy in hero sons, one wall surrounding"
5305,THE LOWER WORLD,"Her seven hills, even as Cybele, riding"
5306,THE LOWER WORLD,"Through Phrygian cities, wears her crown of towers,"
5307,THE LOWER WORLD,"Rejoicing in her offspring, and embracing"
5308,THE LOWER WORLD,"A hundred children of the gods, her children,"
5309,THE LOWER WORLD,"Celestials, all of them, at home in heaven."
5310,THE LOWER WORLD,"Turn the eyes now this way; behold the Romans,"
5311,THE LOWER WORLD,"Your very own. These are Iulus’ children,"
5312,THE LOWER WORLD,The race to come. One promise you have heard
5313,THE LOWER WORLD,"Over and over: here is its fulfillment,"
5314,THE LOWER WORLD,"The son of a god, Augustus Caesar, founder"
5315,THE LOWER WORLD,"Of a new age of gold, in lands where Saturn"
5316,THE LOWER WORLD,Ruled long ago; he will extend his empire
5317,THE LOWER WORLD,"Beyond the Indies, beyond the normal measure"
5318,THE LOWER WORLD,"Of years and constellations, where high Atlas"
5319,THE LOWER WORLD,Turns on his shoulders the star-studded world.
5320,THE LOWER WORLD,Maeotia and the Caspian seas are trembling
5321,THE LOWER WORLD,"As heaven’s oracles predict his coming,"
5322,THE LOWER WORLD,And all the seven mouths of Nile are troubled.
5323,THE LOWER WORLD,"Not even Hercules, in all his travels,"
5324,THE LOWER WORLD,"Covered so much of the world, from Erymanthus"
5325,THE LOWER WORLD,"To Lerna; nor did Bacchus, driving his tigers"
5326,THE LOWER WORLD,From Nysa’s summit. How can hesitation
5327,THE LOWER WORLD,Keep us from deeds to make our prowess greater?
5328,THE LOWER WORLD,What fear can block us from Ausonian land?
5329,THE LOWER WORLD,
5330,THE LOWER WORLD,"“And who is that one yonder, wearing the olive,"
5331,THE LOWER WORLD,"Holding the sacrifice? I recognize him,"
5332,THE LOWER WORLD,"That white-haired king of Rome, who comes from Cures,"
5333,THE LOWER WORLD,"A poor land, to a mighty empire, giver"
5334,THE LOWER WORLD,Of law to the young town. His name is Numa.
5335,THE LOWER WORLD,Near him is Tullus; he will rouse to arms
5336,THE LOWER WORLD,"A race grown sluggish, little used to triumph."
5337,THE LOWER WORLD,"Beyond him Ancus, even now too boastful,"
5338,THE LOWER WORLD,"Too fond of popular favor. And then the Tarquins,"
5339,THE LOWER WORLD,"And the avenger Brutus, proud of spirit,"
5340,THE LOWER WORLD,Restorer of the balance. He shall be
5341,THE LOWER WORLD,First holder of the consular power; his children
5342,THE LOWER WORLD,"Will stir up wars again, and he, for freedom"
5343,THE LOWER WORLD,"And her sweet sake, will call down judgment on them,"
5344,THE LOWER WORLD,"Unhappy, however future men may praise him,"
5345,THE LOWER WORLD,In love of country and intense ambition.
5346,THE LOWER WORLD,
5347,THE LOWER WORLD,"“There are the Decii, and there the Drusi,"
5348,THE LOWER WORLD,"A little farther off, and stern Torquatus,"
5349,THE LOWER WORLD,"The man with the axe, and Camillus, the regainer"
5350,THE LOWER WORLD,"Of standards lost. And see those two, resplendent"
5351,THE LOWER WORLD,"In equal arms, harmonious friendly spirits"
5352,THE LOWER WORLD,"Now, in the shadow of night, but if they ever"
5353,THE LOWER WORLD,"Come to the world of light, alas, what warfare,"
5354,THE LOWER WORLD,"What battle-lines, what slaughter they will fashion,"
5355,THE LOWER WORLD,"Each for the other, one from Alpine ramparts"
5356,THE LOWER WORLD,"Descending, and the other ranged against him"
5357,THE LOWER WORLD,"With armies from the east, father and son"
5358,THE LOWER WORLD,"Through marriage, Pompey and Caesar. O my children,"
5359,THE LOWER WORLD,"Cast out the thoughts of war, and do not murder"
5360,THE LOWER WORLD,"The flower of our country. O my son,"
5361,THE LOWER WORLD,"Whose line descends from heaven, let the sword"
5362,THE LOWER WORLD,"Fall from the hand, be leader in forbearing!"
5363,THE LOWER WORLD,
5364,THE LOWER WORLD,"“Yonder is one who, victor over Corinth,"
5365,THE LOWER WORLD,"Will ride in triumph home, famous for carnage"
5366,THE LOWER WORLD,"Inflicted on the Greeks; near him another,"
5367,THE LOWER WORLD,Destroyer of old Argus and Mycenae
5368,THE LOWER WORLD,Where Agamemnon ruled; he will strike down
5369,THE LOWER WORLD,A king descended from Achilles; Pydna
5370,THE LOWER WORLD,"Shall be revenge for Pallas’ ruined temple,"
5371,THE LOWER WORLD,"For Trojan ancestors. Who would pass over,"
5372,THE LOWER WORLD,"Without a word, Cossus, or noble Cato,"
5373,THE LOWER WORLD,"The Gracchi, or those thunderbolts of warfare,"
5374,THE LOWER WORLD,"The Scipios, Libya’s ruin, or Fabricius"
5375,THE LOWER WORLD,"Mighty with little, or Serranus, ploughing"
5376,THE LOWER WORLD,The humble furrow? My tale must hurry on:
5377,THE LOWER WORLD,"I see the Fabii next, and their great Quintus"
5378,THE LOWER WORLD,Who brought us back an empire by delaying.
5379,THE LOWER WORLD,"Others, no doubt, will better mould the bronze"
5380,THE LOWER WORLD,"To the semblance of soft breathing, draw, from marble,"
5381,THE LOWER WORLD,The living countenance; and others plead
5382,THE LOWER WORLD,"With greater eloquence, or learn to measure,"
5383,THE LOWER WORLD,"Better than we, the pathways of the heaven,"
5384,THE LOWER WORLD,"The risings of the stars: remember, Roman,"
5385,THE LOWER WORLD,"To rule the people under law, to establish"
5386,THE LOWER WORLD,"The way of peace, to battle down the haughty,"
5387,THE LOWER WORLD,"To spare the meek. Our fine arts, these, forever.”"
5388,THE LOWER WORLD,
5389,THE LOWER WORLD,"Anchises paused a moment, and they marvelled."
5390,THE LOWER WORLD,"And he went on:--“See, how Marcellus triumphs,"
5391,THE LOWER WORLD,"Glorious over all, with the great trophies"
5392,THE LOWER WORLD,"Won when he slew the captain of the Gauls,"
5393,THE LOWER WORLD,Leader victorious over leading foeman.
5394,THE LOWER WORLD,When Rome is in great trouble and confusion
5395,THE LOWER WORLD,"He will establish order, Gaul and Carthage"
5396,THE LOWER WORLD,"Go down before his sword, and triple trophies"
5397,THE LOWER WORLD,Be given Romulus in dedication.”
5398,THE LOWER WORLD,
5399,THE LOWER WORLD,"There was a young man going with Marcellus,"
5400,THE LOWER WORLD,"Brilliant in shining armor, bright in beauty,"
5401,THE LOWER WORLD,"But sorrowful, with downcast eyes. Aeneas"
5402,THE LOWER WORLD,"Broke in, to ask his father: “Who is this youth"
5403,THE LOWER WORLD,Attendant on the hero? A son of his?
5404,THE LOWER WORLD,One of his children’s children? How the crowd
5405,THE LOWER WORLD,"Murmurs and hums around him! what distinction,"
5406,THE LOWER WORLD,"What presence, in his person! But dark night"
5407,THE LOWER WORLD,Hovers around his head with mournful shadow.
5408,THE LOWER WORLD,"Who is he, father?” And Anchises answered:--"
5409,THE LOWER WORLD,"“Great sorrow for our people! O my son,"
5410,THE LOWER WORLD,Ask not to know it. This one fate will only
5411,THE LOWER WORLD,Show to the world; he will not be permitted
5412,THE LOWER WORLD,"Any long sojourn. Rome would be too mighty,"
5413,THE LOWER WORLD,"Too great in the gods’ sight, were this gift hers."
5414,THE LOWER WORLD,What lamentation will the field of Mars
5415,THE LOWER WORLD,"Raise to the city! Tiber, gliding by"
5416,THE LOWER WORLD,"The new-built tomb, the funeral state, bear witness!"
5417,THE LOWER WORLD,No youth from Trojan stock will ever raise
5418,THE LOWER WORLD,"His ancestors so high in hope, no Roman"
5419,THE LOWER WORLD,"Be such a cause for pride. Alas for goodness,"
5420,THE LOWER WORLD,"Alas for old-time honor, and the arm"
5421,THE LOWER WORLD,"Invincible in war! Against him no one,"
5422,THE LOWER WORLD,"Whether on foot or foaming horse, would come"
5423,THE LOWER WORLD,"In battle and depart unscathed. Poor boy,"
5424,THE LOWER WORLD,If you should break the cruel fates; if only--
5425,THE LOWER WORLD,You are to be Marcellus. Let me scatter
5426,THE LOWER WORLD,"Lilies, or dark-red flowers, bringing honor"
5427,THE LOWER WORLD,"To my descendant’s shade; let the gift be offered,"
5428,THE LOWER WORLD,However vain the tribute.”
5429,THE LOWER WORLD,
5430,THE LOWER WORLD,"So through the whole wide realm they went together,"
5431,THE LOWER WORLD,Anchises and his son; from fields of air
5432,THE LOWER WORLD,"Learning and teaching of the fame and glory,"
5433,THE LOWER WORLD,"The wars to come, the toils to face, or flee from,"
5434,THE LOWER WORLD,"Latinus’ city and the Latin peoples,"
5435,THE LOWER WORLD,The love of what would be.
5436,THE LOWER WORLD,
5437,THE LOWER WORLD,"There are two portals,"
5438,THE LOWER WORLD,"Twin gates of Sleep, one made of horn, where easy"
5439,THE LOWER WORLD,"Release is given true shades, the other gleaming"
5440,THE LOWER WORLD,"White ivory, whereby the false dreams issue"
5441,THE LOWER WORLD,To the upper air. Aeneas and the Sibyl
5442,THE LOWER WORLD,Part from Anchises at the second portal.
5443,THE LOWER WORLD,"He goes to the ships, again, rejoins his comrades,"
5444,THE LOWER WORLD,"Sails to Caieta’s harbor, and the vessels"
5445,THE LOWER WORLD,Rest on their mooring-lines.

5459,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
5460,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Her funeral mound

5463,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The wind held fair to the night, and the white moon"
5464,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Revealed the way over the tremulous water.
5465,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,They skimmed the shores of Circe’s island; there

5467,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Ring with continual singing, and the halls"
5468,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Were bright with cedar burning through the night,"
5469,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,And the strident shuttle ran across the weaving.
5470,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Off shore, they heard the angry growl of lions"
5471,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Trying to shake their shackles off, and roaring"
5472,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"In the late darkness, bristling boars, and bears"
5473,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Coughing in cages, and the great wolves howling."
5474,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"All these were men, whom cruel Circe’s magic"
5475,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Changed into animals. But Neptune kept
5476,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The Trojans safely seaward, filled the sails,"
5477,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Carried them safely past these anxious harbors.
5478,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
5479,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And now the sea is crimson under the dawn,"
5480,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Aurora glowing in her ruddy car,"

5482,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The slow oars struggle in the marble sea,"
5483,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,As from the ship Aeneas sees a grove
5484,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And through its midst a pleasant river running,"
5485,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The Tiber, yellow sand and whirling eddy,"
5486,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Down to the sea. Around, above and over,"

5493,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To tell the story: who were kings in Latium,"

5502,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
5503,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,King Latinus
5504,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Was an old man, long ruler over a country"
5505,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Blessed with the calm of peace. He was, they tell us,"
5506,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The son of Faunus; Marica was his mother,"
5507,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"A nymph, Laurentian-born. And Faunus’ father"
5508,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Was Picus, son of Saturn, the line’s founder."
5509,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Latinus had no sons; they had been taken,"
5510,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"By fate, in their young manhood; an only daughter"
5511,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Survived to keep the house alive, a girl"
5512,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Ripe for a husband. She had many suitors
5513,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"From Latium, from Ausonia. Most handsome,"
5514,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Most blessed in ancestry, was the prince Turnus,"
5515,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Whom the queen mother favored, but the portents"
5516,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Of the high gods opposed. There was a laurel
5517,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"In the palace courtyard, tended through the years"
5518,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"With sacred reverence, which king Latinus,"
5519,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"When first he built the city, had discovered,"
5520,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And hallowed to Apollo, and the people"
5521,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Were called Laurentians, from its name. A marvel,"
5522,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"So runs the story, occurred here once, a swarm"

5524,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To settle in the branches, a dense jumble"

5529,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Another time Lavinia was standing

5532,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Her hair broke out in flame, sparks leaped and crackled"
5533,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,From diadem and coronal; her progress
5534,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Was a shower of fire, as she moved through the palace"
5535,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Robed with gray smoke and yellow light, a vision"
5536,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Fearful and wonderful. She would be glorious,"
5537,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"They said, in fame and fortune, but the people"
5538,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Were doomed, on her account, to war."
5539,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
5540,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Latinus
5541,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Was troubled by such prophecies, and turned"
5542,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To Faunus, his prophetic father, seeking"
5543,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"His oracles for help, in Albunean"
5544,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Woodland and forest, where the holy fountain"
5545,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Makes music, breathing vapor from the darkness."
5546,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Italian men, Oenotrian tribes, in trouble"
5547,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Come here for answers; here the priesthood, bringing"
5548,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The offerings for sacrifice, by night-time"
5549,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Slumbers on fleece of victims, seeing visions,"
5550,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Hearing strange voices, meeting gods in converse,"
5551,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Deep down in Acheron. Hither Latinus
5552,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Came, pilgrim and petitioner; the fleeces"
5553,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Were spread for him, a hundred woolly victims,"
5554,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And as he lay, half waking and half sleeping,"
5555,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"From the deep grove he heard a voice:--“My son,"
5556,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Seek not a Latin husband for the princess;
5557,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Distrust this bridal; stranger sons are coming
5558,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To wed our children, to exalt our title"
5559,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"High as the stars, and from that marriage offspring"
5560,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Will see, as surely as sun looks down on ocean,"
5561,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,The whole world at their feet.” These answers Faunus
5562,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Gave to his son, warnings in night and silence;"
5563,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Latinus may have said no word, but Rumor"
5564,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Had spread the news, all up and down the cities"
5565,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Throughout Ausonia, by the time the Trojans"
5566,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Tied up their vessels at the grassy landing.
5567,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
5568,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Aeneas and the captains and Iulus
5569,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Sprawled in the shade; a feast was spread; they placed
5570,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The wheels of hardtack on the ground, and on them"
5571,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Morsels of food, and sliced or quartered apples,"
5572,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And after these were eaten, hunger drove them"
5573,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,To break the disks beneath with teeth and fingers.
5574,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"“Ho!” cries Iulus, “We are eating our tables!”"
5575,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"A boy’s joke, nothing more. But the spoken word"
5576,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Meant something more, and deeper, to Aeneas,"
5577,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"An end of hardship. He caught up the saying,"
5578,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Felt the god’s presence. “Hail!” he cried, remembering,"
5579,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"“Hail, O my destined land! All hail, ye faithful"
5580,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Gods of our homeland! Here our country lies.
5581,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Now I remember what Anchises told me:
5582,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"_My son, when hunger overtakes you, driven"
5583,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To unknown shores, and the food seems so little"
5584,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"You find it best to gnaw the tables also,"
5585,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"There hope for home, there build, however weary,"
5586,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The city walls, the moat, the ditch, the rampart._"
5587,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"This must have been that hunger, and the ending"
5588,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Of our misfortunes. Come then, let us gladly"
5589,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Explore what lands these are, what people hold them."
5590,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Now pour your cups to Jove, in the light of morning,"
5591,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Pray to Anchises; let the wine again
5592,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Go round in happiness.” He wreathed his temples
5593,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"With forest greenery, and made his prayers,"
5594,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To the genius of the place, to the nymphs, to Earth,"
5595,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Oldest of goddesses, to the unknown rivers,"
5596,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To Night, and all her rising stars, to Jove,"
5597,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To Cybele, to his parents, in heaven or Hades."
5598,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,And the almighty father thrice made thunder
5599,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"From the clear sky, and a bright cloud blazed above them"
5600,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"With rays of burning light, and a sudden rumor"
5601,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Runs through the Trojan ranks that the day has come
5602,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To build the city due them. Cheered by the omen,"
5603,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"They hurry on the feast, set out the wine-bowls,"
5604,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Crown them with garlands.
5605,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
5606,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,And on the next bright morning
5607,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"As light streamed over the earth, they took the bearings"
5608,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,For city and land and coast-line; here they found
5609,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Numicius’ fountain, here the river Tiber,"
5610,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Here the brave Latins dwell. A hundred envoys,"
5611,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Picked men of every station, Aeneas orders"
5612,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,To go to King Latinus’ noble city:
5613,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"They must bear gifts, be crowned with leaves of olive,"
5614,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Appeal for peace. They hurry at his bidding.
5615,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Aeneas himself marks where the walls shall rise,"
5616,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"With a shallow trench, studies the site, and circles"
5617,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The settlement, like a camp, with moat and rampart."
5618,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,And his ambassadors had made their journey;
5619,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"They were seeing, now, the Latin towers and roof-tops,"
5620,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And, on suburban plains, young men in training,"
5621,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Breaking their steeds to saddle or car, or drawing"
5622,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The bow, or hurling darts, daring each other"
5623,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To fights and races. A courier, at the gallop,"
5624,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Brought the king word that foreigners were coming,"
5625,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Big men, in strange attire. He bade them welcome,"
5626,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And took his place, high on the throne, before them."
5627,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
5628,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"That was a mighty palace, rising high"
5629,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Over the city, with a hundred columns;"
5630,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Picus had ruled from there, and the place was holy"
5631,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,With sacred forest and revered tradition.
5632,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Here kings received the sceptre, here uplifted"
5633,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The bundled rods of power; here was their senate,"
5634,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Their banquet-hall, their temple; here the elders"
5635,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Made sacrifice, faced the long line of tables."
5636,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And here were statues of the ancient fathers,"
5637,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Carved out of cedar, Italus, Sabinus,"
5638,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The planter of the vine, whose image guarded"
5639,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The curving sickle, and Saturn, and two-faced Janus,"
5640,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,All standing in the hallways; and other kings
5641,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,From the very first beginning; and warriors wounded
5642,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Fighting for homeland. On the door were hanging
5643,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The consecrated arms; and there were chariots,"
5644,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Trophies of battle, curving axes, helmets"
5645,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And helmet-plumes, bars wrenched from gates, and javelins,"
5646,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And shields, and beaks of captured ships. Quirinus,"
5647,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The god (on earth the hero, Romulus),"
5648,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Was seated, holding the sacred staff of office,"
5649,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Wearing the augur’s robe; and near him Picus,"
5650,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Tamer of horses, whom that lovesick woman,"
5651,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Circe, his wife, had struck with her golden wand,"
5652,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,And changed by magic spells into a bird
5653,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Whose wings were of many colors.
5654,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
5655,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"In this temple,"
5656,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Latinus, from his father’s throne, gave summons,"
5657,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And the Trojans entered, and he made them greeting"
5658,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"In courteous oration: “Tell me, Trojans--"
5659,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"We know, you see, your city and race, your voyage"
5660,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Across the oceans--tell me your petition.
5661,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"What cause, what need, has brought you here? You have come"
5662,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Over the blue-green waters to Ausonia.
5663,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Were you off your course, or driven by storm? Mischances"
5664,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,On the high seas are not unknown to sailors.
5665,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"No matter: you have entered peaceful rivers,"
5666,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,You rest in a good harbor. We bid you welcome.
5667,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Do not avoid our friendship. We must tell you
5668,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,We Latins come from Saturn; we are people
5669,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Whose sense of justice comes from our own nature
5670,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And the custom of our god. No law, no bondage,"
5671,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Compels our decency. And I remember,"
5672,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Though it was long ago, some story told us"
5673,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"By older men; it seems that Dardanus,"
5674,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"An ancestor of yours, was born here, left here"
5675,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"For towns in Phrygian Ida, and Thracian Samos,"
5676,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Or Samothrace, they call it now. He left here,"
5677,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"When he departed, from his Tuscan dwelling"
5678,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Called Corythus, and now the golden palace"
5679,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Of starry sky receives him, throned in heaven,"
5680,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"A god, who multiplies their count of altars.”"
5681,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
5682,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Ilioneus answered:--“Son of Faunus,"
5683,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Great king, no tempest and no blackness drove us"
5684,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Over the waves to shelter here; no star,"
5685,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"No shore, has fooled us in our voyage."
5686,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"We came on purpose, and with willing hearts,"
5687,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To this your city, exiled from a kingdom,"
5688,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The greatest, once, that ever the sun looked down on."
5689,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,We come from Jove; in Jove as ancestor
5690,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The sons of Troy rejoice; our king, Aeneas,"
5691,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Himself is sprung from Jove; it is he who sent us
5692,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To seek your threshold. No one in all the world,"
5693,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Whether he lives on the farthest edge of ocean,"
5694,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Whether he lives in the deepest heart of the tropics,"
5695,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"No one, I think, but knows how fierce a storm-cloud"
5696,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Broke from Mycenae over the plains of Ida,"
5697,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And how two worlds, Europe and Asia, battled"
5698,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Driven by fate to war. We have been driven
5699,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"By that great tidal wave across vast oceans,"
5700,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And now we ask a little home, a harbor--"
5701,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"We will do no damage--for our country’s gods,"
5702,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"We ask for nothing more than all should have,"
5703,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"For air and water. You need not be sorry,"
5704,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"We shall do nothing shameful in your kingdom,"
5705,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Your fame, your kindness, as we tell the story,"
5706,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Will grow in greatness. Ausonia, I promise,"
5707,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Will not regret receiving Troy. I swear it
5708,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"On our captain’s fate and honor, proven often"
5709,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"In loyalty, in war. There are many nations,"
5710,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Nations and people both, who have often sought us,"
5711,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Wanted us for their allies--do not scorn us
5712,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"For coming as petitioners, with garlands,"
5713,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,With suppliant words--it was the will of heaven
5714,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,That drove us to your shores. Dardanus came
5715,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"From here, and over and over again Apollo guides us"
5716,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,To Tiber and Numicia’s sacred fountain.
5717,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Our king is sending presents, little tokens"
5718,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Of former fortune, relics and remainders"
5719,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Rescued from Troy on fire. This gold Anchises
5720,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Used when he poured libations at the altar,"
5721,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"This sceptre and this diadem were Priam’s,"
5722,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Who wore these robes, the work of Trojan women,"
5723,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,When he gave laws to the assembled people.”
5724,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
5725,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Latinus, at his words, was grave; he held"
5726,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"His gaze downcast, but his anxious eyes kept turning."
5727,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"It was not the crimson color, nor Priam’s sceptre,"
5728,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"That moved him so; he was thinking of his daughter,"
5729,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Her marriage, and the oracle of Faunus."
5730,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"This one might be the man, this stranger, coming"
5731,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"From a far-off land, might be his son, a ruler"
5732,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Called, by the fates, to share his power, to father"
5733,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Illustrious children, masters of the world."
5734,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"He spoke, in gladness:--“Bless, O gods, our project"
5735,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And your own augury! It will be given,"
5736,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"O Trojan, as you ask. I do not scorn"
5737,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The gifts you bring. Never, while I am ruling,"
5738,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Shall you be lacking fruitful land in plenty,"
5739,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,And Troy’s abundance shall be yours forever.
5740,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And as for king Aeneas, if you bring us"
5741,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"True tidings of his longing for our friendship,"
5742,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Our hospitality, and our alliance,"
5743,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Let him appear in person, let him never"
5744,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Shrink from our friendly gaze. To King Latinus
5745,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"It will be pact and covenant to meet him,"
5746,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,To take him by the hand. Give him my answer:
5747,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,I have a daughter; prodigies from heaven
5748,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Innumerable, and my father’s warnings,"
5749,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Delivered through his oracle, forbid me"
5750,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,To give my daughter to a native husband.
5751,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,They tell me that my son-to-be is coming
5752,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"From foreign shores, to raise our name to heaven."
5753,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Such is the prophecy they make for Latium.
5754,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Your king, I think, must be the man they promise,"
5755,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,If I have any sense of divination.
5756,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,He is the one I choose.”
5757,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
5758,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And he brought horses,"
5759,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The pick of his stables, out of all his hundreds,"
5760,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Assigned them to the Trojans in due order,"
5761,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Swift runners they were, caparisoned with crimson,"
5762,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"With saddle-cloths of gold, and golden halters"
5763,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Swung at their shoulders, and the bits were golden."
5764,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,He chose a chariot for Aeneas; with it
5765,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Two stallions breathing fire, immortal horses"
5766,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Sprung from the stock which Circe, in her cunning,"
5767,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Had stolen from the sun, her father, and bred them"
5768,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,To her own mares. The Trojans rode back happy
5769,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,With gifts and peace and welcome from Latinus.
5770,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
5771,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And here was Juno coming back from Argos,"
5772,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Riding the air, and fierce as ever, seeing,"
5773,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"As far away as Sicily and Pachynus,"
5774,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Aeneas and the Trojan fleet rejoicing.
5775,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"She saw them building homes, she saw them trusting"
5776,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The friendly land, she saw their ships forsaken."
5777,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"She stopped, she tossed her head, in hurt and hatred,"
5778,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Speaking, with none to listen:--“There they are,"
5779,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The race I hate, the fates that fight my own."
5780,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,They could not die on Sigean fields; they could not
5781,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Be captured, and stay captured. Troy went down,"
5782,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"It seems, in fire, and they rose from the ashes."
5783,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Armies and flame were nothing; they found the way.
5784,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Whereas my power, no doubt, lies weak and weary,"
5785,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"I have hated them enough, I am tired of hating,"
5786,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,I have earned my rest. Or have I? I dared to follow
5787,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Those exiles over the water with deadly hatred,"
5788,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Used up all threats of sea and sky against them,"
5789,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And what good did it do? Scylla, Charybdis,"
5790,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The Syrtes, all availed me nothing. Tiber"
5791,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Shelters them in his channel now, in safety."
5792,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"What do they care for me, or the threats of ocean?"
5793,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Mars could destroy the giant race of Lapiths,"
5794,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Jupiter put a curse on Calydon
5795,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To soothe Diana’s anger; what had either,"
5796,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Calydon or the Lapiths, done to merit"
5797,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The vengeance of the gods? But I, great queen"
5798,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Of heaven, wife of Jove, I keep enduring,"
5799,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Dare everything, turn everywhere, for nothing--"
5800,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"I am beaten by Aeneas! So, if my power"
5801,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Falls short of greatness, I must try another’s,"
5802,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Seek aid where I can find it. If I cannot
5803,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Bend Heaven, I can raise Hell. It will not be given,--"
5804,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"I know, I know--to keep him from his kingdom,"
5805,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To keep him from his bride: Lavinia, Latium,"
5806,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Will come to him in time. It is permitted
5807,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,To keep that time far off. It is permitted
5808,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To strike their people down. It will cost them something,"
5809,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Their precious father and son. As for the bride,"
5810,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Bloodshed will be her dowry, and Bellona"
5811,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Matron of honor. Hecuba bore one firebrand,"
5812,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And Venus’ issue shall be such another,"
5813,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,A funeral torch for Troy re-born.”
5814,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
5815,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,She came
5816,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Earthward, with that, and summoned, in her anger,"
5817,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"One of the evil goddesses, Allecto,"
5818,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Dweller in Hell’s dark shadows, sorrow-bringer,"
5819,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Lover of gloom and war and plot and hatred.
5820,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Even her father hates her, even her sisters,"
5821,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"She takes so many forms, such savage guises,"
5822,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Her hair a black and tangled nest of serpents.
5823,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,And Juno whets the knife-edge of her passion:--
5824,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"“Daughter of Night, grant me a boon, a service,"
5825,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,To keep my pride and honor undefeated.
5826,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Stop it, this Trojan swindle of Latinus"
5827,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"With marriages, this ravage of his kingdom!"
5828,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,You have the power: when brothers love each other
5829,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"You know the way to arm them, set them fighting,"
5830,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"You can turn houses upside down with malice,"
5831,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Bring under one roof the lash, the funeral torches,"
5832,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"You have a thousand names of evil-doing,"
5833,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"A thousand ways and means. Invent, imagine,"
5834,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Contrive--break up the peace, sow seeds of warfare,"
5835,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Let arms be what they want; in the same moment
5836,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Let arms be what they seize.”
5837,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
5838,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Therewith Allecto,"
5839,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Infected with her Gorgon poison, travelled"
5840,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To Latium and the palace, where the queen,"
5841,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Amata, brooded, womanly resentment"
5842,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Burning within her heart, for Turnus’ marriage,"
5843,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And, fuel on fire, the coming of the Trojans."
5844,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"From her own dark hair, Allecto pulled one serpent"
5845,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Meant for the queen, her intimate heart, her bosom,"
5846,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Corruption, evil, frenzy, for the household."
5847,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Between the robe and the smooth breasts the serpent
5848,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Went gliding deep, unseen, unfelt; the woman"
5849,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Received the viperous menace. The snake grew larger,"
5850,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Became a collar of gold, became a ribbon"
5851,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Wound through the hair, entwining, sliding smoothly"
5852,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Over the limbs, mercurial poison, working"
5853,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"With slow infection, no great passionate fury,"
5854,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"So that the queen, at first, spoke low and softly,"
5855,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"As mothers do, protesting to Latinus"
5856,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,And weeping for her daughter’s Trojan marriage:--
5857,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"“Must she be given, my lord, to Trojan exiles?"
5858,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Have you no pity for her, for yourself,"
5859,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"No pity for a mother? He will desert us,"
5860,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"This faithless pirate, with our child as booty,"
5861,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,At the first turn of the wind. That was the way--
5862,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Remember?--the Phrygian shepherd came to Sparta
5863,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And went away with Leda’s daughter, Helen."
5864,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,A solemn pledge--does that amount to nothing?
5865,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,You loved your people once; you were bound to Turnus.
5866,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Our son must be a stranger; Faunus says so.
5867,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"If Faunus speaks, so be it. I remind you"
5868,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"All lands, not ours, are foreign; and prince Turnus,"
5869,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"By the letter of the oracle, an alien."
5870,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Trace back his ancestry--Acrisius’ daughter
5871,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Founded his line, and what could be more foreign"
5872,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Than the heart of Greece, Mycenae?”"
5873,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
5874,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,But she found
5875,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Her words were vain: Latinus had decided,"
5876,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,She saw she could not move him. And the poison
5877,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"By now had taken hold, a wild excitement"
5878,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Coursing the veins; her bones were turned to water;
5879,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Poor queen, there was no limit to her raging,"
5880,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Streeling, one end of the city to another."
5881,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"You know how schoolboys, when a top is spinning,"
5882,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Snap at it with a whiplash, in a circle"
5883,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Around an empty court, and keep it going,"
5884,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Wondering at the way it keeps on whirling,"
5885,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Driven by blows in this or that direction,"
5886,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"So, through the midst of cities and proud people,"
5887,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Amata drives, is driven. Madness and guilt upon her,"
5888,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"She flies to the mountains, tries to hide her daughter"
5889,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Deep in the woods, acts like a drunken woman,"
5890,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Cries, over and over, “This girl is meant for Bacchus,"
5891,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And not for any Trojans, only Bacchus"
5892,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Is worthy of her; she honors him in dancing,"
5893,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Carries his wand, and keeps for him the sacred"
5894,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Lock of her hair!” And Rumor, flying over,"
5895,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Excites the other wives to leave their houses.
5896,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"They come with maddened hearts, with their hair flying,"
5897,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Their necks bare to the winds; they shriek to the skies,"
5898,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Brandish the vine-bound spears, are dressed as tigers,"
5899,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Circle and wheel around their queen, whose frenzy"
5900,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Tosses the burning pine-brand high, in gesture"
5901,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To suit the marriage-hymn: “O Latin mothers,"
5902,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Listen, wherever you are: if any care"
5903,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"For poor Amata moves you, or any sense"
5904,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Of any mother’s rights, come join the revels,"
5905,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Loosen the hair, exult!” Allecto drives her"
5906,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To the dens of the beasts; her eyes are stained and bloodshot,"
5907,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Rolled upward to the white.
5908,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
5909,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"So, thought Allecto,"
5910,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"That should suffice: the palace of Latinus,"
5911,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And all the king intended, in confusion."
5912,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"She flew on dusky wings, a gloomy goddess,"
5913,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To the bold Rutulian’s walls, that city, founded,"
5914,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Men say, by Danaë and Acrisian settlers,"
5915,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"A place once called Ardea, and it keeps"
5916,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Its ancient name; its glory has departed.
5917,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And here, in his high palace, Turnus slumbered."
5918,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"In the dead of night, Allecto changed her features,"
5919,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Her limbs, transformed her glowering, her grimness,"
5920,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To an old woman’s wrinkles, bound a ribbon"
5921,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Around gray hair, worked in a wreath of olive,"
5922,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And she was Calybe then, an aged priestess"
5923,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Of Juno’s temple, and so she came to Turnus:--"
5924,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"“Turnus! Can this be borne, so many labors"
5925,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Wasted, the kingdom given to the Trojans?"
5926,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The king denies you all, the bride, the dowry"
5927,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Bought with your blood; his heir must be a stranger.
5928,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"They mock you; never mind. Go forth, protect them,"
5929,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Save them from dangers, see what thanks they give you,"
5930,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Lay low the Tuscan ranks, hold over the Latins"
5931,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The shield of peace. I tell you, Juno told me,"
5932,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And you so calmly slumbering all through it,"
5933,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Rise up, be doing something, and be happy"
5934,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To see the young men armed, and get them going"
5935,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Out of the gates! There are ships to burn, and captains"
5936,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,To set on fire: the mighty gods command it.
5937,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Let King Latinus know it, let him reckon"
5938,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"With Turnus in arms, unless he keeps his promise.”"
5939,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"But Turnus, smiling at her, answered:--“Mother,"
5940,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,You tell me nothing new; I know a fleet
5941,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Has come to Tiber’s waters; do not scare me
5942,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"With fears imagined; Juno, I am certain,"
5943,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Has not forgotten me. Your age, old woman,"
5944,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Worn-down, truth-weary, harries you with worries,"
5945,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Makes you ridiculous, a busybody,"
5946,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Nervous for nothing in the wars of kings.
5947,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Back to the temple, mind your proper business,"
5948,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Leave war and peace where they belong, with warriors.”"
5949,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Allecto blazed with anger: Turnus, speaking,"
5950,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Was suddenly afraid, so wild her features,"
5951,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"So fierce her flaming eyes, the snakes of the Fury"
5952,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Hissing disaster. She shoves him back; he falters,"
5953,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Tries to say more; she plies her whip, she doubles"
5954,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The rising serpents, and her wild mouth cries,"
5955,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"“See me for what I am, worn down, truth-weary,"
5956,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Nervous for nothing in the wars of kings!
5957,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"See what I am, see where I come from, bringing"
5958,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"War, war and death, from the Grim Sisters’ home.”"
5959,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"She flung the firebrand at him, torch and terror"
5960,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Smoking with lurid light. The body, sweating,"
5961,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Is torn from sleep; he cries for arms, he seeks"
5962,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Arms at his bedside, through the hallways, lusting"
5963,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"For sword and steel, war’s wicked frenzy mounting"
5964,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,To rampant rage. Even so a cauldron bubbles
5965,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"When fire burns hot beneath, and water seethes,"
5966,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Stirs, shifts, breaks out in boiling, and the cloud"
5967,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Of steam goes toward the sky. The peace is broken.
5968,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,The call to arms is given; let the captains
5969,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"March on Latinus, drive the foe from Latium,"
5970,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Protect the fatherland. Turnus is coming;
5971,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"No matter who they are, Trojans or Latins,"
5972,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Turnus will take them on. And his example,"
5973,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"His frenzied prayer, shook his Rutulian comrades,"
5974,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"All eagerness for war. They all admired him,"
5975,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"For handsome bearing, youth, or deeds of courage,"
5976,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Or kingly birth: boldness engenders boldness.
5977,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
5978,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Allecto, meanwhile, took a new direction,"
5979,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,To the Trojans now; she had found a place for mischief
5980,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Along the shore, she had seen Iulus hunting;"
5981,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"His hounds were driven to madness; the scent was rank,"
5982,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Hot in their nostrils; away they went, the pack"
5983,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"In full cry after the deer, and that pursuit"
5984,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Was the first cause of trouble; that first kindled
5985,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The countryside to violence. That deer,"
5986,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"A handsome animal, with mighty antlers,"
5987,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Belonged, a pet, to Tyrrhus and his children,"
5988,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Who had raised him from a fawn. Tyrrhus, the father,"
5989,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Was keeper of the royal herds, and Silvia,"
5990,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The daughter, used to comb the beast, and wash him,"
5991,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Twine garlands in his horns, caress and love him,"
5992,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And he, grown used to her, would wander freely"
5993,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Over the woods and meadows, and come home"
5994,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,At nightfall to the friendly door and stable.
5995,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,This was the deer Iulus’ hounds had started
5996,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Floating downstream, reclining by the river"
5997,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"For coolness’ sake, where young Ascanius, burning"
5998,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"For a huntsman’s praise, saw him, and loosed the arrow"
5999,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"That pierced the belly and side, so the poor creature"
6000,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Came wounded to the house he knew, and moaning"
6001,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Crept into his stall, bleeding, and like a person"
6002,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Asking for help, filled all the house with sorrow."
6003,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"First Silvia came, beating her arms, and others,"
6004,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Summoned for help, equipped themselves for vengeance,"
6005,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,With Allecto lurking in the silent forest.
6006,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"A knotted club, a sharpened stake, a firebrand,"
6007,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Whatever comes to hand will serve, when anger"
6008,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Is looking for a weapon. Tyrrhus calls them,"
6009,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"They are warriors now, not farmers; they leave the logging,"
6010,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The quartered oak, the wedges; in breathless anger"
6011,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Tyrrhus grabs up the axe. A perfect moment
6012,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,For the goddess on her watch-tower!--she comes flying
6013,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To the stable roof; she sounds the shepherds’ call,"
6014,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Straining her hellish voice on the curved horn
6015,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Till grove and woodland echo. Diana’s lake
6016,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Hears, and Velinus’ fountain, and white Nar,"
6017,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The spring of sulphur; and mothers, in their panic,"
6018,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Hold their young children close. But swift to the sound,"
6019,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The dire alarum, came the farmers, running;"
6020,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,They call no man their master; they snatch up weapons.
6021,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,And on the other side the youth of the Trojans
6022,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Pour through the open gates to help Iulus.
6023,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,They are drawn up now; no more a rustic quarrel
6024,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"With stakes and clubs, the double-bladed steel"
6025,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Decides the issue, swords are drawn, the harvest"
6026,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Is black and spiky; bronze defies the sunlight,"
6027,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Tossing its luster cloudward. As waves at sea
6028,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"At first are little whitecaps under the wind,"
6029,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And slowly turn to billows, and then great combers,"
6030,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"So rose the swell of war. Young Almo fell,"
6031,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Eldest of Tyrrhus’ sons; a whirring arrow,"
6032,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Piercing the throat, choked him in his own blood."
6033,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And many around him fell, among them one,"
6034,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"A good old man, Galaesus, who had come forward"
6035,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To plead for peace, and died; he was most just"
6036,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Of all Ausonia’s men, and wealthy, counting"
6037,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Five flocks of sheep and cattle; a hundred ploughs
6038,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Furrowed his acres.
6039,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
6040,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"So they fought together,"
6041,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And neither won,--Allecto had kept her promise:"
6042,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"She had soaked the war in blood, she had made beginning"
6043,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Of death in battle. She left the western land,"
6044,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"She soared to Juno in heaven, proud of her triumph:--"
6045,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"“There it is for you, perfect, war created"
6046,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"From disagreement! Tell them to join in friendship,"
6047,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Let them make treaties, now my hand has spattered"
6048,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,The Trojans with Ausonian blood! And still
6049,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"I can do more, if you desire it: cities"
6050,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Near-by, I can plague to war with rumors, burn them"
6051,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"With wild desire for battle, bring in allies"
6052,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,From everywhere; I will sow the land with armies.”
6053,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"But Juno answered:--“That is plenty, thank you;"
6054,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,They can not stop it now; man battles man;
6055,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Fresh blood is on the arms that chance first gave.
6056,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Now let them stage that bridal feast, that wedding,"
6057,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Venus’ distinguished son, and king Latinus!"
6058,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Olympus’ ruler would be most unwilling
6059,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,To let you roam thus freely in the heavens;
6060,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Be gone from here; whatever more is needed,"
6061,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"I will attend to.” So spoke Saturn’s daughter,"
6062,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And the serpents hissed as the Fury raised her wings,"
6063,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Flew up, swooped down, to Hell. Under high hills"
6064,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"In Italy’s heart, there lies a vale, Ampsanctus,"
6065,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Well known in many lands. Dark forests hide it
6066,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"On every side, and in its very centre"
6067,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"A roaring torrent over the rocks goes brawling,"
6068,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And there is a cavern here, a breathing hole"
6069,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"For terrible Dis, and a gorge, where Acheron river"
6070,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Opens the deadly jaws; and here Allecto
6071,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Sank out of sight, relieving earth and heaven."
6072,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
6073,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,And Juno gave the war the final touches.
6074,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The shepherds came to the city from the battle,"
6075,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Bearing young Almo, slain, and old Galaesus,"
6076,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"His peaceful face defiled; they cry to the gods,"
6077,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"They call on King Latinus. Turnus is there,"
6078,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"As they cry murder, fuel to their fire,"
6079,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Making their terror double: _the kingdom falls
6080,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To the men of Troy_, he shouts; _our blood is tainted;"
6081,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"I am degraded here!_ And the Latin mothers,"
6082,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Trooping the pathless woods in Bacchic orgies,"
6083,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Amata’s cause being their cause, assemble"
6084,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"From every side; it is Mars for whom they clamor,"
6085,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Not Bacchus any more. And all the people,"
6086,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Against the omens, against the will of the gods,"
6087,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Cry out for wicked war. They fight each other,"
6088,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Almost, to siege and storm Latinus’ palace."
6089,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,He is a rock in the sea; he stands like a sea-rock
6090,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"When a crash of water comes, and it is steadfast"
6091,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Against the howl of the waves, and the roar is useless,"
6092,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And the sea-weed, flung at the side, goes dripping back."
6093,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,But even so Latinus could not conquer
6094,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Their blind determination. Things were going
6095,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"As Juno willed. He invoked the empty air,"
6096,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"He invoked the gods, in vain. “Alas, we are broken!"
6097,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"We are broken by fate, we are swept away by storm."
6098,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"You will pay for this, you will pay for it with bloodshed,"
6099,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"O my poor people! And punishment is waiting,"
6100,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Turnus, for you; you will find it very bitter,"
6101,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And then you will pray, and it will be too late."
6102,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"My rest is won, my voyage almost over;"
6103,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"I lose a happy death.” He said no more,"
6104,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Shut himself in his palace, and relinquished"
6105,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,The reins of power.
6106,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
6107,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"There was a Latin custom,"
6108,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Cherished, thereafter, by the Alban cities,"
6109,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"As now by Rome, great empress--when they rouse"
6110,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The god of war to battle, against the Getans,"
6111,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Arabians, Hyrcanians, no matter;"
6112,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Whether they march on India, or strive"
6113,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To win back captured standards from the Parthians,"
6114,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The custom holds. There are twin gates of Mars,"
6115,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Held in both awe and reverence; they are fastened
6116,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"By bolts of bronze, a hundred, by the eternal"
6117,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Solidity of iron, and their guardian"
6118,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Is Janus, always watchful at the threshold."
6119,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"These, when the fathers vote for war, the consul,"
6120,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Girt in the dress of Romulus, and belted"
6121,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Gabinian-wise, with his own hand must open,"
6122,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Must swing the portals wide, with his own voice"
6123,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Cry war, and the others follow, and the trumpets"
6124,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Give tongue in bronze agreement. So Latinus
6125,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Was called on, by that custom, for announcement"
6126,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Of war against the Trojans, for the opening"
6127,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Of those grim gates. But he refused to touch them,"
6128,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Fled from the task he loathed, hid in the darkness,"
6129,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And Juno, coming from heaven, shoved them open"
6130,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"With her own hand; the turning hinges grated,"
6131,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The iron was loosed for war. And all Ausonia,"
6132,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Listless till then, unmoved, blazed out in fury:"
6133,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"On foot they came, on horseback; through the dust"
6134,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The cry rang out _To arms!_ They oil the shields,"
6135,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"They make the javelins shine, they hone the axes,"
6136,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"They love the sight of banner, the sound of trumpet."
6137,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"In five great cities, Tibur, Crustumerium,"
6138,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Antemnae, and Atina, and Ardea,"
6139,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Strong towns, and proud, and turret-crowned, they forge"
6140,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"New weapons on their anvils; they carve out helmets,"
6141,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Make wicker covers for the shields; they hammer
6142,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Breastplates of bronze, or greaves of pliant silver."
6143,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,They beat their ploughshares into swords; the furnace
6144,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Gives a new temper to the blades of their fathers.
6145,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Alarum sounds, password is whispered. Helmets"
6146,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Come down from the wall; the yoke weighs down the horses;
6147,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"A man puts on his armor, picks up his shield,"
6148,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Buckles his sword to his side.
6149,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
6150,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Open the mountain,"
6151,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Muses, release the song!--what kings were hurried"
6152,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Hot-haste to war, who filled their battle-lines,"
6153,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"How Italy blossomed with men, and burned with weapons,"
6154,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"For you remember, Muses, and you have power"
6155,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To make us all remember, deeds that rumor,"
6156,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Far-off and faint, brings to our recollection."
6157,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
6158,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"First from the Tuscan shore came fierce Mezentius,"
6159,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Arming his columns, the man who scorned the gods."
6160,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Beside him, handsomer than any other,"
6161,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Save only Turnus, stood his son, young Lausus,"
6162,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Tamer of horses, huntsman, from Agylla,"
6163,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Leading a thousand warriors, a vain mission;"
6164,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"He was worthy, Lausus, of a happier fortune"
6165,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Than being his father’s subject; he was worthy
6166,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Of a better father.
6167,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
6168,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Near them, Aventinus"
6169,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Paraded over the field his horses, victors"
6170,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"In many a fight, his chariots, crowned with palm-leaves."
6171,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"His shield portrayed a hundred snakes, and the Hydra,"
6172,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Serpent-surrounded, a token of his father,"
6173,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"For this was Hercules’ son, whose manly beauty"
6174,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Was like his father’s. His mother was a priestess,"
6175,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Rhea, whom Hercules had known when, victor,"
6176,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"He had slain Geryon, reached Laurentian country,"
6177,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,And bathed Iberian cattle in the Tiber.
6178,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,His birthplace was the forest on the hillside
6179,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,That men call Aventine; his birth was secret.
6180,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"His men go into battle with pikes and javelins,"
6181,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Fight with the tapering sabre, and a curious"
6182,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Sabellan type of dart. And Aventinus
6183,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Strode out on foot, the skin of a lion swinging"
6184,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Across his shoulders; the bristling mane was shaggy,"
6185,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And the head rose above it like a helmet,"
6186,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,With the white teeth bared and snarling. So he entered
6187,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The royal halls, and everything about him"
6188,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Gave sign of Hercules.
6189,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
6190,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Next came two brothers,"
6191,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Twins from the town of Tibur, named Catillus"
6192,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,And Coras; through the throng of spears they entered
6193,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"As Centaurs, born from clouds, come down the mountains,"
6194,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Crashing through wood and thicket in their onrush.
6195,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
6196,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"There was Caeculus, the founder of Praeneste,"
6197,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"A king who, legend says, was born to Vulcan"
6198,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"In a country that raised cattle, found, untended,"
6199,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Beside a campfire. His men were country fellows
6200,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"From every here and there, from steep Praeneste,"
6201,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"From Juno’s Gabian fields, from the cold river,"
6202,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The Anio, Anagnia, Amasenus,"
6203,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Hernician rocks, and dewy stream and meadow."
6204,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Some of them had no arms, no shields, no chariots,"
6205,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Their weapons, for the most part, being slingshots"
6206,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And bullets of dull lead, but some of them carried"
6207,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"A couple of darts apiece, and for their headgear"
6208,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Wore tawny wolfskins; they kept the left foot bare,"
6209,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,They wore a rawhide shinguard on the other.
6210,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
6211,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And there was Messapus, a son of Neptune,"
6212,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"A tamer of horses, a man whom none in battle"
6213,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Could hurt with fire or sword; his people came
6214,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To war from years and years of peaceful living,"
6215,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Men from Fescennium, Soracte’s mountains,"
6216,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Flavinian fields, Ciminus’ lake and hillside,"
6217,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Capena’s groves. They sang as they were marching,"
6218,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Hailing their king in measured step and rhythm,"
6219,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Their music like the sound of swans, bound home,"
6220,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"White through white cloud, as they return from feeding,"
6221,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,And the long throats pour echoing music over
6222,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Meadow and river. You would not think of warriors,"
6223,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Marshalled in bronze, in that array, but a cloud"
6224,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Of raucous birds, driven from sea to shore."
6225,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
6226,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Clausus, a host in himself, led a great host"
6227,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Of Sabine blood; the Claudian tribe at Rome
6228,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Of Sabine origin owes to him its name.
6229,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"His followers came from many cities, Cures,"
6230,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Eretum, Amiternum, and Mutusca,"
6231,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Renowned for olives, Tetrica, Nomentum,"
6232,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Velinus’ countryside and Mount Severus,"
6233,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Casperia and Foruli; many rivers
6234,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Had served their thirst, the Fabaris, the Tiber,"
6235,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Himella’s stream, chill Nursia, and Allia,"
6236,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,A name of evil omen: they came like waves
6237,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Rolling to Africa’s coast when fierce Orion
6238,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Sinks in the wintry ocean, as thick as grain"
6239,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Turned brown in early summer on Hermus’ plain
6240,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Or Lydia’s yellow acres. The earth trembles
6241,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Under their feet; the shields clang on their shoulders.
6242,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
6243,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And there was Agamemnon’s son, Halaesus,"
6244,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,A hater of the Trojan name; for Turnus
6245,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"He yoked his steeds, he brought a thousand peoples,"
6246,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Men who hoe Massic vineyards, men from hills,"
6247,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Men from the plains; men from Volturnus’ river,"
6248,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Men from the town of Cales; Oscan people,"
6249,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Saticulan hosts. Their weapon is the javelin,"
6250,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Wound with the whiplash; an old-fashioned shield
6251,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Covers their left; for work, close-in, they carry"
6252,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Sharp-bladed scimitars.
6253,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
6254,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,And Oebalus
6255,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Was with him, son of Telon and Sebethis,"
6256,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Born by that nymph when Telon, old, was ruling"
6257,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Over Capri, a realm his son extended"
6258,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Over Sarrastrian tribes, over the plainland,"
6259,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The Sarnus waters; Batulum, Celemna,"
6260,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Rufrae, were all his towns, and high Abella,"
6261,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Rich in its apple-trees. These warriors carried
6262,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Some kind of German dart; they used for headgear
6263,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Bark of the cork-tree: shields and swords were bronze.
6264,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
6265,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"From Nersae Ufens came, a man distinguished"
6266,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"In arms and reputation; his tribe were huntsmen,"
6267,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Farmers, after a fashion; they wore their armor"
6268,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Even when ploughing. Rugged soil they lived on;
6269,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,They loved to raid and live on what they raided.
6270,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
6271,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Archippus, the Marruvians’ king, had sent"
6272,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"A warrior-priest, Umbro, renowned in courage."
6273,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,His helmet carried olive leaves; he knew
6274,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,The arts of charming serpents and of healing
6275,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Their venomous wounds; he had no magic, later,"
6276,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Against the Trojan spear-point, and the herbs,"
6277,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Gathered on Marsian hills, availed him little"
6278,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,In days of war; his native groves and waters
6279,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Mourned his untimely death.
6280,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
6281,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And Virbius came,"
6282,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Aricia’s handsome son, raised in the groves,"
6283,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The marshy shores around Diana’s altar,"
6284,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Most rich, most gracious. Hippolytus, his father,"
6285,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Had once been slain, the story runs, a victim"
6286,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Of Phaedra’s hate and passion, and the vengeance"
6287,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,His father took; he had been drawn and quartered
6288,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"By Theseus’ stallions, but Apollo’s magic,"
6289,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Diana’s love, had given him life again"
6290,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Under the stars and the fair light of heaven,"
6291,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And Jupiter, angry that any mortal"
6292,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Should rise from shadow to life, struck down his healer,"
6293,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Apollo’s son, with a fearful blast of thunder,"
6294,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Hippolytus being hidden by Diana
6295,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"In a secret place, where the nymph Egeria tended"
6296,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Her sacred grove; there he lived out, alone,"
6297,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"In the Italian woods, the days of his life"
6298,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"With no renown; he took another name,"
6299,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Virbius, meaning, _Twice a man_; no horses"
6300,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Ever came near that grove, that holy temple,"
6301,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Seeing that horses on an earlier shore
6302,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Had overturned his chariot in panic
6303,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And been his death, driven to panic terror"
6304,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"By monsters from the ocean. But his son,"
6305,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Virbius the younger, had no fear of horses,"
6306,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Driving and riding to war.
6307,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
6308,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Among the foremost,"
6309,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Taller than any, by a head, was Turnus,"
6310,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Gripping the sword; his helmet, triple-crested,"
6311,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Had a Chimaera on it, breathing fire"
6312,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"From gaping jaws; the bloodier the battle,"
6313,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The hotter the fight, the redder that reflection,"
6314,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And on his shield, in gold, the story of Io,"
6315,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The heifer, once a girl; you could see her guardian,"
6316,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Argus, the hundred-eyed, and her poor father,"
6317,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The river-god with streaming urn, Inachus."
6318,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"And a cloud of warriors on foot behind him,"
6319,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Columns with shields, the Argives and Auruncans,"
6320,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Rutulians, old Sicanians, Labicians"
6321,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"With colored shields, Sacranians, men from Tiber,"
6322,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Ploughmen of Circe’s ridge, soldiers from Anxur,"
6323,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Sons of Feronia, that land of greenness"
6324,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Where Satura’s marsh lies dark, and the cold river"
6325,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Runs seaward through the valley.
6326,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
6327,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,And last of all
6328,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Camilla rode, leading her troops on horseback,"
6329,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Her columns bright with bronze, a soldieress,"
6330,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"A woman whose hands were never trained to weaving,"
6331,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To the use of wool, to basketry, a girl"
6332,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"As tough in war as any, in speed afoot"
6333,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,Swifter than wind. She could go flying over
6334,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The tips of the ears of the wheat, and never bruise them,"
6335,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"So light her way, she could run on the lift of the wave,"
6336,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Dry-shod; and they came from the houses and fields to wonder,"
6337,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"To gaze at her going, young men, and matrons thronging,"
6338,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Wide-eyed and with parted lips, at the glory of royal crimson"
6339,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"Over her shoulders’ smoothness, the clasp of the gold"
6340,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"In her hair, and the way she carried the Lycian quiver,"
6341,ITALY: THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,"The heft of the pastoral myrtle, the wand with the spearpoint."

6351,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"As Turnus raised war’s banner, and the trumpets"
6352,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Blared loud above Laurentum’s citadel,"
6353,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And fiery horses reared, and arms were clashing,"
6354,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Confusion reigned: all Latium joined alliance,"
6355,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The youth were mad for war. Messapus, Ufens,"
6356,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And that despiser of the gods, Mezentius,"
6357,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Brought forces in from everywhere; wide fields
6358,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Were stripped of countrymen. They sent a message
6359,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"By Venulus, to Diomede in Arpi:"
6360,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,_Come to our aid; the Trojans are in Latium;
6361,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Aeneas with a fleet and vanquished gods
6362,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Proclaims himself a king; it is fate, he says;"
6363,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,And many tribes are joining him; his name
6364,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Spreads far and wide in Latium._ Diomede
6365,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"(The message says) better than many others,"
6366,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Should know the outcome, if the grace of fortune"
6367,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Follows Aeneas in the scheme he nurtures.
6368,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,He knows the Trojans; he can judge them better
6369,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Than Turnus or Latinus.
6370,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"So, in Latium,"
6371,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Events were shaping, and Aeneas knew it,"
6372,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And saw it all, and turned and tossed in torment"
6373,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,On a great sea of trouble. The swift mind
6374,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Went searching, probing, veering with every shift,"
6375,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"As when in a bronze bowl the light of water,"
6376,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Reflected by the sun or moonlight, wavers,"
6377,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Dances and flits about, from wall to ceiling."
6378,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Night: over all the world the weary creatures,"
6379,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The beasts and birds, were deep in sleep; Aeneas,"
6380,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"With warfare in his heart, stretched out for rest"
6381,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Where the cold sky was awning over the river,"
6382,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And sleep came late. Before him rose an image,"
6383,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"An aged head amid the poplar leaves,"
6384,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"A mantle of gray, and shady reeds around him,"
6385,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Tiber, the river-god, in consolation"
6386,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And comfort speaking:--“Son of the gods, redeemer"
6387,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Of Troy from overseas, her savior ever,"
6388,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"O long-awaited on Laurentian fields,"
6389,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Here is your home, be sure of it; here dwell"
6390,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Your household gods, be sure. Do not turn back,"
6391,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Do not be frightened by the threats of war:
6392,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,The swollen rage of Heaven has subsided.
6393,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Soon--do not take my words for idle phantoms,"
6394,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Illusions of a dream--under the holm-oaks
6395,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Along the shore, you will find a huge sow lying,"
6396,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"White, with a new-born litter at her udders,"
6397,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Thirty of them, all white, a certain token"
6398,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Of a new city, in thirty years. Your son"
6399,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Will found it; he will call it the White City,"
6400,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"A glorious name, beyond all doubt whatever."
6401,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Further, I have a word or two of guidance"
6402,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,To speed you through the pressure of the moment
6403,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Toward ultimate victory. Inland a little
6404,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Arcadian people live, a race descended"
6405,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"From Pallas’ line; their king is called Evander,"
6406,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Under whose banner they have built a city,"
6407,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,High on the hills; its name is Pallanteum.
6408,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,They wage continual warfare with the Latins;
6409,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Take them as allies, in covenant and treaty."
6410,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And I myself will guide you there, upstream"
6411,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Along the banks, the oars against the current."
6412,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Rise, goddess-born; when the stars set, make prayer"
6413,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"To Juno first, with suppliant vows appeasing"
6414,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Her threats and anger. As for me, my tribute"
6415,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"May wait your triumph. I am blue-green Tiber,"
6416,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The river most dear to Heaven, I am the river"
6417,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"You see, brim-full to these rich banks, this ploughland:"
6418,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"This is my home, the source of lofty cities.”"
6419,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,
6420,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"So spoke the river-god, to his deep pool diving."
6421,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Slumber and night were gone. Aeneas rose,"
6422,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Faced eastern sunlight, took up river water"
6423,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"In the hollow of his hands, and made his prayer:--"
6424,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"“Laurentian Nymphs, to whom the rivers owe"
6425,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Their essence, father Tiber, holy river,"
6426,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Receive Aeneas, be his shield in danger."
6427,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Wherever your presence dwells, in pool or fountain,"
6428,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Whatever land its flowing bounty graces,"
6429,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"O comforter in time of trouble, surely"
6430,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Our gifts will bring their meed of honor, always,"
6431,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,To the horned ruler of the western waters.
6432,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Only be with us, give us confirmation!”"
6433,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,He had made his prayer; two ships were quickly chosen
6434,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Out of the fleet, equipped, and the crews made ready."
6435,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,
6436,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And then a marvel struck their eyes, a wonder!"
6437,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"White in the wood, on the green ground, there lay"
6438,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"A sow with her white litter, and Aeneas"
6439,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Brought them in sacrifice to Juno’s altar.
6440,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"All that long night, the Tiber calmed his flood;"
6441,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The silent wave, retreating, lay as still"
6442,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,As pool or mere or watery plain; the oars
6443,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Dipped without strain; the voyage went with laughter
6444,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,And cheerful shouting; over the waters rode
6445,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,The oily keels; and waves and woods in wonder
6446,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Beheld the shields of men, the colored vessels,"
6447,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Divide the flood. Day turns to night. They traverse
6448,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The winding bends, with green shade arching over,"
6449,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Parting the green woods in the quiet water,"
6450,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Till it is noon, and they see walls and houses,"
6451,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Evander’s town, which Roman power later"
6452,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Made equal to the city, a mighty empire,"
6453,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"But it was little then. They turned to the shore,"
6454,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Drew near the city.
6455,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,
6456,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"On that day, it happened,"
6457,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The king was paying customary homage,"
6458,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"In a grove before the city, to the gods,"
6459,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"To Hercules, most of all. And his son Pallas"
6460,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Was with him there, and the leaders of the people,"
6461,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The lowly senate, bringing gifts of incense"
6462,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Where the warm blood was smoking at the altars.
6463,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"They saw the tall ships come, they saw them gliding"
6464,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Upstream, through the dark wood, the feathered oar-blades"
6465,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Making no noise at all, and they were frightened,"
6466,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"They rose; they would have left the feast, but Pallas,"
6467,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Unterrified, forbade them; he seized a weapon,"
6468,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Rushed out in challenge, calling from a hillock:--"
6469,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"“What cause, young men, has brought you here, exploring"
6470,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Ways that you do not know? Where are you going?
6471,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,What is your race? Where do you come from? Are you
6472,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Bringers of peace or war?” Aeneas answered
6473,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"From the high stern, raising the branch of olive:--"
6474,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"“We are men from Troy; we are armed against the Latins,"
6475,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Whose arrogant war we flee. We seek Evander.
6476,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Take him this message: tell him chosen leaders,"
6477,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Dardanus’ sons, have come, to seek for friendship,"
6478,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"For allied arms.” And Pallas, in amazement"
6479,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"At hearing that great name, cried, “Come and join us,"
6480,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Whoever you are, speak to my father, enter,"
6481,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"O guest, into our household!” And his hand"
6482,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Reached out to greet and guide them. They left the river,"
6483,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Drew near the grove; with friendly words Aeneas
6484,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Spoke to Evander:--“Best of the sons of Greeks,"
6485,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"To whom, at fortune’s will, I bring petition,"
6486,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Bearing the branch of peace, I have not been frightened"
6487,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"To come to you, a Danaan chief, related"
6488,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,To Atreus’ twin sons. In my own right
6489,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,I am worth something; we are bound together
6490,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"By the god’s holy oracles, by the old"
6491,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Ancestral kinship, by your own renown"
6492,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Widespread through all the world. I am glad to follow
6493,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The will of fate. Dardanus, our great father,"
6494,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Was father of Troy; his mother was Electra,"
6495,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Daughter of Atlas, who carries on his shoulders"
6496,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The weight of heaven. Mercury is your father,"
6497,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Born, on Cyllene’s chilly peak, to Maia,"
6498,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And Maia, if legend is credible, the daughter"
6499,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Of Atlas, who carries heaven on his shoulders."
6500,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"A common blood runs in our veins, and therefore"
6501,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"I sent no embassies, I planned no careful"
6502,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Tentative overtures; myself, I came here"
6503,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"My life at your disposal, in supplication"
6504,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Before your threshold. We are harried in war
6505,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"By the same race that harries you, the sons"
6506,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Of Daunus; nothing, so they think, will stop them,"
6507,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"If we are beaten, from complete dominion"
6508,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Over the western land and both her oceans.
6509,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Receive and give alliance: our hearts are brave,"
6510,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Our spirit tried and willing.”
6511,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,
6512,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,He had finished.
6513,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Evander had been watching him, expression,"
6514,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Gesture, and mood, and bearing. He made answer:--"
6515,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"“How gladly, bravest man of all the Trojans,"
6516,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"I recognize and welcome you! Your father,"
6517,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The great Anchises, speaks to me again,--"
6518,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"These are the words, the voice, the very features"
6519,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"That I recall so well. Once Priam came here,"
6520,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Faring to Salamis, his sister’s kingdom."
6521,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,I was a young man then; I stared in wonder
6522,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"At the chiefs of Troy, at Priam, but Anchises"
6523,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Towered above them all, and my heart was burning"
6524,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"To clasp his hand, to speak with him: I met him,"
6525,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"I led him, proudly, to Pheneus’ city,"
6526,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And when he left, he gave me a fine quiver"
6527,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"With Lycian arrows, a cloak with gold embroidered,"
6528,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,A pair of golden bridles; my son Pallas
6529,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Rejoices in them now. The bond you ask for
6530,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Is given, the treaty made. To-morrow morning"
6531,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"My escort will attend your leave, my riches"
6532,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Be at your service. Meanwhile, since you come here"
6533,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"As friends of ours, join us in celebrating"
6534,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,These yearly rites of ours. It is not permitted
6535,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Our people to postpone them. In your kindness,"
6536,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Become accustomed to your allies’ tables.”
6537,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,
6538,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,He gave the orders for the feast’s renewal.
6539,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Once more the cups are set; the king, in person,"
6540,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Conducts his guests to places on the greensward,"
6541,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Reserving for Aeneas, in special honor,"
6542,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"A maple throne, draped with the skin of a lion."
6543,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Chosen attendants and the priest of the altar
6544,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Bring the roast portions, pile the bread in baskets,"
6545,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Serve Bacchus’ wine. Aeneas and the Trojans
6546,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Feast on the consecrated food.
6547,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,
6548,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,When hunger
6549,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Was satisfied, and the wine went round, Evander"
6550,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Told them a story:--“No vain superstition,"
6551,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"No ignorance of the gods, enjoins upon us"
6552,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"These solemn rites, this feast, this deep devotion"
6553,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"To a mighty power’s altar. O Trojan guest,"
6554,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"We are grateful men, saved from a cruel danger,"
6555,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"We pay these rites each year, each year renewing"
6556,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,A worship justly due. Look up at the cliff
6557,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Hung on the high rocks yonder, see the scattered"
6558,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Rubble of rock, the ruin of a dwelling,"
6559,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,The jumble of toppled crags. There was a cave there
6560,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Once on a time; no man had ever measured
6561,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Its awful depth, no sunlight ever cheered it."
6562,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The half-man, Cacus, terrible to look at,"
6563,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Lived in that cave, and the ground was always reeking"
6564,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"With the smell of blood, and nailed to the doors, the faces"
6565,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Of men hung pale and wasted. Vulcan fathered
6566,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,This monster; you would know it if you saw him
6567,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"With the black fire pouring from mouth and nostrils,"
6568,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,A bulk of moving evil. But time at last
6569,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Brought us the help we prayed for; a great avenger,"
6570,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"A god, came to our rescue, Hercules,"
6571,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Proud in the death and spoil of triple Geryon,"
6572,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Drove his huge bulls this way, the great herd filling"
6573,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Valley and river. And the crazy Cacus,"
6574,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Who never would lose a chance for crime or cunning,"
6575,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Made off with four of the bulls and four sleek heifers,"
6576,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Dragging them by their tails; the tracks would never
6577,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Prove he had driven them to his rocky cavern.
6578,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,He hid them in the darkness; whoever looked
6579,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Would think they had gone not to, but from, the cave."
6580,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Meanwhile, as Hercules drove the well-fed herd"
6581,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Out of the stables to the road again,"
6582,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Some of them lowed in protest; hill and grove
6583,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Gave back the sound, and from the cave one heifer"
6584,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Lowed in return. That was the doom of Cacus.
6585,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Black bile burned hot in Hercules; he grabbed
6586,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"His weapons, his great knotted club, went rushing"
6587,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Up to the mountain-top. Never before
6588,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Had men seen terror in the eyes of Cacus.
6589,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Swifter than wind, he dove into his cavern,"
6590,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Shut himself in, shattered the links of iron"
6591,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"That held aloft the giant boulder, dropped it"
6592,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"To block the doorway, and Hercules came flinging"
6593,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"His angry strength against it, to no purpose."
6594,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"This way he faced, and that, and gnashed his teeth"
6595,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,In sheer frustration; he went around the mountain
6596,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Three times, in burning rage; three times he battered"
6597,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The bulkhead of the door; three times he rested,"
6598,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Breathless and weary, on the floor of the valley."
6599,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Above the cavern ridge, a pointed rock,"
6600,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"All flint, cut sharp, with a sheer drop all around it,"
6601,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Rose steep, a nesting place for kites and buzzards."
6602,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,It leaned a little leftward toward the river.
6603,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"This Hercules grabbed and shook, straining against it;"
6604,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"His right hand pushed and wrenched it loose; he shoved it,"
6605,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"With a sudden heave, down hill, and the heaven thundered,"
6606,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The river ran backward and the banks jumped sideways,"
6607,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And Cacus’ den stood open, that great palace"
6608,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Under the rock, the chambered vault of shadows."
6609,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"An earthquake, so, might bring to light the kingdoms"
6610,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Of the world below the world, the pallid regions"
6611,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Loathed by the gods, the gulf of gloom, where phantoms"
6612,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Shiver and quake as light descends upon them.
6613,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"So there was Cacus, desperate in the light,"
6614,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Caught in the hollow rock, howling and roaring"
6615,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"As Hercules rained weapons down upon him,"
6616,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Everything he could use, from boughs to millstones,"
6617,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,But Cacus still had one way out of the danger:
6618,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,A cloud of smoke rolled out of his jaws; the cave
6619,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Darkened to utter blackness, thick night rolling"
6620,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,With fitful glints of fire. This was too much
6621,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"For Hercules in his fury; he jumped down through it,"
6622,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Through fire, where the smoke came rolling forth the thickest,"
6623,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Where the black billows seethed around the cavern.
6624,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And Cacus, in the darkness, to no purpose"
6625,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Poured forth his fire and smoke. Hercules grabbed him,"
6626,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Twisted him into a knot, hung on and choked him"
6627,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Till the eyes bulged out and the throat was dry of blood.
6628,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"He tore the doors loose, and the house was open;"
6629,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"People could see the lost and stolen plunder,"
6630,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,And Hercules dragged the shapeless ugly carcass
6631,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Out by the feet, a fascinating object"
6632,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"For the gaze of men, the terrible eyes, the muzzle,"
6633,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The hairy chest, and the fire dead in the gullet."
6634,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Ever since then we keep this day, rejoicing"
6635,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,In honor of our deliverance; Potitius
6636,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Was founder of the rite, Pinaria’s household"
6637,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Custodian of the service. In this grove
6638,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"We set our altar, calling it the greatest,"
6639,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And greatest it shall be, to me, forever."
6640,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Join with us, then, in honor of all that glory,"
6641,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Bind wreaths around your temples, reach the wine-cup,"
6642,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Call with good-will upon our common god.”
6643,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,He veiled his hair with the two-colored poplar
6644,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"In Hercules’ honor, and held out the goblet;"
6645,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,All made libation and prayer.
6646,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,
6647,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And evening came,"
6648,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And the priests went forth, Potitius first; they wore"
6649,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The skins of beasts, and they were bearing torches."
6650,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The feast renewed, they brought the welcome viands"
6651,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"To a second table, loading, too, the altars."
6652,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,And the Dancing Priests around the sacred altars
6653,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Lit fire and sang their songs. They too wore poplar,"
6654,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Both groups, one old, one young, and chanted verses"
6655,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"In praise of Hercules, his deeds, his glories,"
6656,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"How first he strangled in his grip twin serpents,"
6657,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The monsters Juno sent; how, great in war,"
6658,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Troy and Oechalia went down before him;
6659,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"How, under King Eurystheus, he bore"
6660,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"A thousand heavy toils, at Juno’s order."
6661,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"“Hail, O unvanquished hero, whose hand brought low"
6662,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Pholus, Hylaeus, the cloud-born double shapes,"
6663,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Monsters of Crete and the Nemean lion.
6664,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The Stygian lakes trembled at Hercules’ crossing,"
6665,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And Cerberus was frightened, in his cavern,"
6666,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Lying on bones half-eaten. O unafraid
6667,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Of any monster, even Typhoeus, towering"
6668,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"High in his arms, even the snake of Lerna"
6669,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"With all its hissing heads,--hail, son of Jove,"
6670,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Hail, glorious addition to the heavens!"
6671,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Favor our rites and yours with gracious blessing!”
6672,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"So they sang praises, and they crowned the service"
6673,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"With the tale of Cacus, that fire-breathing monster,"
6674,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,And hill and woodland echoed to the singing.
6675,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,
6676,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Then back to the city again; and old Evander
6677,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Kept his son Pallas near him and Aeneas,"
6678,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Talking of various matters, so the journey"
6679,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Was lightened, and the landscape charmed Aeneas,"
6680,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Who wondered as he watched the scene, and questioned,"
6681,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,And learned its early legend. King Evander
6682,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Began the story:--“Native Nymphs and Fauns
6683,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Dwelt in these woodlands once, and a race of men"
6684,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Sprung from the trunks of trees, or rugged oak,"
6685,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Men primitive and rude, with little culture:"
6686,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"They had no knowledge of ploughing, none of harvest;"
6687,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The fruits of the wild trees, the spoils of hunting,"
6688,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Gave them their nourishment. Then Saturn came here,"
6689,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Fleeing Jove’s arms, an exile from his kingdom."
6690,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"He organized this race, unruly, scattered"
6691,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Through the high mountains, gave them law and order."
6692,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"He gave the place a name; Latium, he called it,"
6693,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Since once he lay there safely, hiding in shelter."
6694,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Under his rule there came those golden ages
6695,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"That people tell of, all the nations dwelling"
6696,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,In amity and peace. But little by little
6697,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"A worse age came, lack-luster in its color,"
6698,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And the madness of war, and the evil greed of having."
6699,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Then came the Ausonian bands, Sicanian peoples,"
6700,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And the land of Saturn took on other names,"
6701,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And the kings came, and the fierce giant Thybris"
6702,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,For whom we named our river; we forgot
6703,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Its older title, Albula. Here I came"
6704,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"An exile from my country, over the seas,"
6705,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Driven by fate and fortune, which no man"
6706,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Can cope with or escape. The nymph Carmentis,"
6707,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"My mother, led me here with solemn warnings"
6708,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Under Apollo’s guidance.”
6709,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,
6710,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,So Evander
6711,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Finished the tale, resumed the walk. They came,"
6712,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"First, to an altar and a gate: Carmental"
6713,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The Romans call it, in honor of that nymph"
6714,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Who first foretold the greatness of the Romans,"
6715,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,The glory of Pallanteum. Past the portal
6716,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"They came to a spreading grove, a sanctuary"
6717,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Restored by Romulus, and under the cold cliff"
6718,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The Lupercal, named, in Arcadian fashion,"
6719,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,For the great god Pan. And then Evander showed him
6720,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The wood of Argiletum, and told the legend"
6721,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Of the death of Argus, once a guest. From there"
6722,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"They went to the Tarpeian house, and a place"
6723,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Golden as we now know it, once a thicket,"
6724,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Once brush and briar, and now our Capitol."
6725,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Even then men trembled, fearful of a presence"
6726,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Haunting this wood, this rock. “A god lives here,”"
6727,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Evander said, “What god, we are not certain,"
6728,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,But certainly a god. Sometimes my people
6729,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Think they have seen, it may be, Jove himself"
6730,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Clashing the darkening shield, massing the storm-cloud."
6731,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Here you can see two towns; the walls are shattered,"
6732,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"But they remind us still of men of old,"
6733,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Two forts, one built by Janus, one by Saturn,"
6734,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Janiculum, Saturnia.”"
6735,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,
6736,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"So they came,"
6737,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Conversing with each other, to the dwelling"
6738,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Where poor Evander lived, and saw the cattle"
6739,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And heard them lowing, through the Roman forum,"
6740,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The fashionable section of our city,"
6741,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And as they came to the house itself, Evander"
6742,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Remembered something,--“Hercules,” he said,"
6743,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"“Great victor that he was, bent head and shoulders"
6744,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"To enter here, and this house entertained him."
6745,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Dare, O my guest, to think of wealth as nothing,"
6746,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Make yourself worthy of the god, and come here"
6747,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Without contempt for poverty.” He led him,"
6748,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The great Aeneas, under the low rafters,"
6749,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Found him a couch, nothing but leaves, and the bedspread"
6750,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,A Libyan bear-skin. And night came rushing down
6751,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Dark-wingèd over the earth.
6752,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,
6753,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,And Venus’ heart
6754,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Was anxious for her son, and with good reason,"
6755,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Knowing the threats and tumult of the Latins.
6756,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"She spoke to Vulcan, in that golden chamber"
6757,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Where they were wife and husband, and her words"
6758,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Were warm with love:--“When the Greek kings were tearing
6759,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Troy’s towers as they deserved, and the walls were fated"
6760,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"To fall to enemy fire, I sought no aid"
6761,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"For those poor people, I did not ask for weapons"
6762,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Made by your art and power; no, dearest husband,"
6763,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"I would not put you to that useless labor,"
6764,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Much as I owed to Priam’s sons, however"
6765,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,I sorrowed for my suffering Aeneas.
6766,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"But now, at Jove’s command, he has made a landing"
6767,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"On the Rutulian coast; I come, a suppliant"
6768,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"To the great power I cherish, a mother asking"
6769,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Arms for her son. If Thetis and Aurora
6770,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Could move you with their tears, behold what people"
6771,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Unite against me, what cities sharpen weapons"
6772,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Behind closed gates, intent on our destruction!”"
6773,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"So Venus pleaded, and as she saw him doubtful,"
6774,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,The goddess flung her snowy arms around him
6775,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"In fondlement, in soft embrace, and fire"
6776,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Ran through him; warmth, familiar to the marrow,"
6777,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Softened his sternness, as at times in thunder"
6778,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Light runs through cloud. She knew her charms, the goddess,"
6779,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Rejoicing in them, conscious of her beauty,"
6780,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Sure of the power of love, and heard his answer:--"
6781,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"“No need for far-fetched pleading, dearest goddess;"
6782,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Have you no faith in me? You might have asked it
6783,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"In those old days; I would have armed the Trojans,"
6784,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,And Jupiter and the fates might well have given
6785,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Another ten years of life to Troy and Priam.
6786,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Now, if your purpose is for war, I promise"
6787,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Whatever careful craft I have, whatever"
6788,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Command I have of iron or electrum,"
6789,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Whatever fire and air can do. Your pleading
6790,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Is foolish; trust your power!” And he came to her
6791,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"With the embrace they longed for, and on her bosom"
6792,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Sank, later, into slumber."
6793,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,
6794,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,And rose early
6795,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"When night was little more than half way over,"
6796,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The way a housewife must, who tends the spindle,"
6797,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Rising to stir and wake the drowsing embers,"
6798,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Working by night as well as day, and keeping"
6799,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The housemaids at the task, all day, till lamplight,"
6800,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"A faithful wife, through toil, and a good mother,"
6801,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Even so, like her, with no more self-indulgence,"
6802,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The Lord of Fire rose early, from soft pillows"
6803,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,To the labor of the forge.
6804,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,
6805,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,An island rises
6806,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Near the Sicanian coast and Lipare,"
6807,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Aeolian land, steep over smoking rocks."
6808,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Below them roars a cavern, hollow vaults"
6809,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Scooped out for forges, where the Cyclops pound"
6810,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,On the resounding anvils; lumps of steel
6811,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Hiss in the water, and the blasts of fire"
6812,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Pant in the furnaces; here Vulcan dwells,"
6813,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The place is called Vulcania, and here"
6814,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,The Lord of Fire comes down. In the great cave
6815,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,The smiths were working iron; a thunderbolt
6816,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Such as Jove hurls from heaven, was almost finished,"
6817,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Shaped by the hands of Brontes, Steropes,"
6818,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,And naked-limbed Pyracmon. They had added
6819,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Three rods of twisted rain and three of cloud,"
6820,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And three of orange fire and wingèd wind,"
6821,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And now they were working in the flash, the sound,"
6822,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The fear, the anger, the pursuing flame."
6823,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Elsewhere a chariot for Mars was building
6824,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,To harry men and cities; and for Pallas
6825,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"An awful shield, with serpent scales of gold,"
6826,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Snakes interwoven, and the Gorgon’s head,"
6827,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Awaiting polish. The neck was severed, the eyes"
6828,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Already seemed to roll, when Vulcan came"
6829,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Crying, “Away with this! Another task"
6830,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Demands your toil, your thought. Arms for a warrior!"
6831,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Use all your strength, you need it now; exert"
6832,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The flying hands, ply all your master skill,"
6833,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Break off delay!” And all, obedient, bent"
6834,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"To the great task; the bronze, the golden ore"
6835,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Run down like rivers, and the wounding steel"
6836,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Melts in the furnace as they shape the shield,"
6837,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Welding it, orb on orb, a sevenfold circle"
6838,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Made one, for all the weapons of the Latins."
6839,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Some keep the bellows panting, others dip"
6840,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The hissing bronze in water, and the anvil"
6841,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Groans under the hammer-stroke. In turn they raise
6842,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Their arms in measured cadence, and the tongs"
6843,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Take hold of the hot metal, twist and turn it."
6844,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,So sped the work on Lemnos.
6845,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,
6846,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,And Evander
6847,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Was wakened by the kindly light of morning
6848,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And bird-song under the eaves, and the old man rose,"
6849,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Donned simple tunic and sandals, and hung on"
6850,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"His simple sword, and over his shoulders twisted"
6851,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The panther hide, out of the way of the hilt."
6852,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Two hounds were all his bodyguard; he came,"
6853,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"So, to Aeneas’ cabin; he remembered"
6854,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"His words and promised service, found his guest"
6855,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"An early riser also; hand met hand,"
6856,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And soon companions joined them, young prince Pallas,"
6857,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Loyal Achates. They stroll a while, then settle"
6858,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Themselves for conversation, and Evander"
6859,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Is first to speak:--“Great captain of the Trojans,"
6860,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"I cannot, while you live, consider Troy"
6861,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"A beaten town, I cannot see her people"
6862,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,As anything but victors. I am sorry
6863,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Our power to help is meager. On one side
6864,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"A river hems us in, and on the other"
6865,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Rutulian armies thunder at our walls.
6866,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Still, I can find you, or I think so, allies,"
6867,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Great people, an encampment rich in kingdoms,"
6868,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,An unexpected aid. The fates have brought you
6869,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"To the right place. Not far away, Agylla,"
6870,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"A city built of ancient stone, lies waiting,"
6871,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"A town the Lydians founded; you know the race,"
6872,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Renowned in war. It was a prosperous city
6873,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"For many years, until Mezentius ruled it,"
6874,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"A cruel, arrogant man, sadist and savage."
6875,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,God pay him back in kind! I cannot tell you
6876,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,All his foul deeds: this will suffice;--he fastened
6877,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Live men to dead men, strapped their hands together,"
6878,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Tied face to face, and killed them, slowly, slowly,"
6879,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,In the waste and stain and clasp of that long death.
6880,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"They suffered long, his subjects, but at last"
6881,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"They rose in arms against him, his mad household,"
6882,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Hurled fire to his roof-top, slaughtered his companions."
6883,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"He fled that ruin to Rutulian fields,"
6884,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Where Turnus’ weapons shielded him. Now all
6885,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Etruria, risen in arms, demands,"
6886,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"With threat of war, the king for punishment,"
6887,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,And you shall be the leader of those thousands
6888,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Who throng the shore with ships, whose cry is _Forward!_"
6889,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"But an old prophet holds them back, those warriors,"
6890,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The pride and glory of an ancient people,"
6891,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Whom a just grievance and a righteous anger
6892,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Inflames against Mezentius. _It is not fated_,"
6893,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"He says, _for any native-born Italian"
6894,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,To tame a race so proud. Choose foreign leaders!_
6895,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,And so the Etruscan battle-lines have settled
6896,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Unwarlike on the plain, through heaven’s warning."
6897,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Tarchon himself has sent me envoys, bearing"
6898,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The crown and sceptre, urging me to his camp,"
6899,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Bidding me take the throne. But cold old age,"
6900,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And years too thin for battle, these begrudge me"
6901,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The high command. I would send my son, but Pallas"
6902,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Comes from a Sabine mother; he is partly
6903,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"A native-born Italian. You, Aeneas,"
6904,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Possess the proper strength, the proper lineage,"
6905,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,The summons of the gods. Take up the burden!
6906,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"My Pallas will go with you, my hope and comfort."
6907,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"You are the one to teach him a soldier’s duty,"
6908,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"How to endure; let him learn from you in action,"
6909,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Behold your deeds, and, in his youth, admire them."
6910,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"I will give two hundred horsemen, young Arcadians,"
6911,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,The flower of our manhood; and two hundred
6912,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Will go with you besides in the name of Pallas.”
6913,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,
6914,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Aeneas and Achates, listening, brooded"
6915,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"With downcast gaze, in troubled speculation"
6916,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Prolonging bitter thoughts, but Venus gave them"
6917,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,A sign from the bright heaven: a flash of thunder
6918,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Came from the cloudless sky, a blare of trumpets,"
6919,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,And all things suddenly shaken. They looked up swiftly;
6920,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Again, again, they heard the roar and rumble,"
6921,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"They saw arms redden in the clear of heaven,"
6922,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Listened to thunder in cloud. And some were frightened;
6923,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Not so the Trojan: he knew his mother’s promise.
6924,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"“Ask not, O friend, the meaning of the portent,”"
6925,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"He cried, “Olympus summons me; I know it."
6926,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,This was the sign my goddess-mother promised
6927,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"When war was near; she would bring me arms from Vulcan,"
6928,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"She said, to help us all. Alas! what slaughter"
6929,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Waits for the Latins now! How costly, Turnus,"
6930,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,The price that must be paid me! Shields and helmets
6931,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And bodies of brave men, swept under Tiber."
6932,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Now let them call for battle, and break treaties!”"
6933,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,
6934,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,He rose and at his quickening the altars
6935,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Blazed into sudden fire; he paid his honors
6936,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"To Hercules, to all the gods of household,"
6937,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And all made sacrifice, sheep duly chosen."
6938,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Aeneas sought, once more, his ships, his comrades,"
6939,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Chose, to attend him, those most brave in battle,"
6940,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Despatched the rest down stream again with tidings
6941,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,To take Ascanius of his father’s fortunes.
6942,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Horses are brought for all the Trojan leaders,"
6943,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And for Aeneas the best, a charger, golden"
6944,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"With lion-skin caparison, claws gilded."
6945,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,
6946,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,And rumor flies about the little city
6947,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Spreading the news of horsemen on their mission
6948,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"To Tarchon’s shores, and mothers, in a panic,"
6949,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Double their prayers, and fear comes nearer danger"
6950,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,With Mars’ great image looming large. Evander
6951,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Holds Pallas by the hand, cannot release him,"
6952,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Speaks through his tears:--“If Jupiter would only
6953,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Bring me my lost years back, make me the man"
6954,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"I used to be, I was once, at Praeneste"
6955,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Where I struck down the foremost ranks, and burned"
6956,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The piled up shields! That day I was a hero,"
6957,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"A conqueror, and Erulus went down,"
6958,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"By this right hand, to hell. His mother gave him"
6959,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Three lives, and threefold armor; I had to kill him"
6960,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Three times, and did, and thrice I stripped his armor."
6961,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"If I were what I used to be, my son,"
6962,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,They would never take you from me; and Mezentius
6963,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Would never have heaped those insults on his neighbor,"
6964,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Never have made a widow of the city.
6965,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"But you, great gods on high, and you, great king"
6966,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Of the high gods, take pity on a father,"
6967,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Hear the Arcadian king. I pray for life
6968,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"As long as Pallas lives, I pray to see him"
6969,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,If you will spare him; if he comes back safely
6970,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,I pray to meet him once again. No more
6971,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"I ask; how hard my life may be, no matter."
6972,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"But if there is in fortune any menace,"
6973,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Something I cannot speak of, let me die"
6974,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Before I know the worst, while I can hope"
6975,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"However I doubt, while still I have my Pallas,"
6976,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"My late and only pleasure, here beside me,"
6977,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And never news for the worse!” And so they parted,"
6978,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,And servants helped the old man into the palace.
6979,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,
6980,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"They had gone from the gates, the horsemen, and Aeneas,"
6981,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Achates and the Trojans, and in the centre"
6982,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Pallas, a blaze of light, like Lucifer"
6983,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Whom Venus loves beyond all fiery stars,"
6984,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The glory risen from the ocean wave,"
6985,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Dissolver of the shadows. On the walls
6986,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The mothers, trembling, watched them go, the squadrons"
6987,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Bright in their bronze, and the cloud of dust behind them,"
6988,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"So, out of sight, where the road turns off to forest,"
6989,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"They go, the men in arms, and a shout arises,"
6990,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And the column forms, and the echo of the gallop"
6991,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Comes clopping back through the ground where the dust is rising.
6992,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,
6993,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The cold stream, Caere, has a grove beside it,"
6994,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Much reverenced of old, where the curve of the hills"
6995,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And the dark firs make a shelter: the old people,"
6996,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"So rumor says, held grove and feast-day sacred"
6997,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Here in Silvanus’ honor, god of the fields,"
6998,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,God of the fold. Tarchon and his Etruscans
6999,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Were camped not far from here, and from the hill-top"
7000,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Watchers could see their legions, tented safely"
7001,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Through the wide plain. In Caere’s grove Aeneas
7002,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Rested his horses and his weary warriors.
7003,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,
7004,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,And the bright goddess through the clouds of heaven
7005,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Came bringing gifts, seeing her son alone"
7006,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"By the cold river in the quiet valley,"
7007,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And spoke to him:--“Behold, the gifts made ready"
7008,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"By Vulcan’s promised skill. Fear not, my son,"
7009,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,To face the wars with Turnus and the Latins!”
7010,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"After the word, the embrace. She placed the armor,"
7011,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"All shining in his sight, against an oak-tree;"
7012,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Rejoicing in the gift, the honor, he turned"
7013,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"His eyes to these, over and over again,"
7014,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Could not be satisfied, took in his hands"
7015,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The helmet with the terrible plumes and flame,"
7016,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The fatal sword, the breastplate, made of bronze,"
7017,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Fire-colored, huge, shining the way a cloud,"
7018,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Dark-blue, turns crimson under the slanting sun,"
7019,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The greaves of gold refined and smooth electrum,"
7020,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The spear, the final masterpiece, the shield."
7021,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,
7022,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Hereon the great prophetic Lord of Fire
7023,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Had carved the story out, the stock to come,"
7024,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The wars, each one in order, all the tale"
7025,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Of Italy and Roman triumph. Here
7026,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,In Mars’ green cave the she-wolf gives her udders
7027,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"To the twin boys, turning half round to lick them,"
7028,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And neither is afraid, and both are playing."
7029,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Another scene presents the Circus-games,"
7030,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"When Romans took their Sabine brides, and war"
7031,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Broke out between old Tatius and the sons
7032,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Of Romulus, and was ended, monarchs pledging"
7033,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Peace at the altars over sacrifice.
7034,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Mettus, the false, by the wild horses drawn"
7035,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And quartered, sheds his life-blood over the brambles;"
7036,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Porsena, the besieger, rings the city"
7037,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"For Tarquin’s sake, exile and tyrant; Romans"
7038,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Rush on the steel for freedom; Clelia breaks
7039,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Her bonds to swim the river; and Horatius
7040,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Breaks down the bridge. The guardian Manlius
7041,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Holds the high capitol and that crude palace
7042,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Fresh with the straw of Romulus; the goose
7043,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Flutters in silver through the colonnades
7044,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Shrieking alarm; the Gauls are near in darkness,"
7045,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Golden their hair, their clothing, and their necks"
7046,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Gleam white in collars of gold, and each one carries"
7047,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Two Alpine javelins; they have long shields.
7048,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Near them, the Fire-god sets the priests with caps"
7049,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Of wool, the miracle of the shields from heaven,"
7050,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The Salii dancing, the Luperci naked,"
7051,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,And the chaste matrons riding through the city
7052,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"In cushioned chariots. Far off, he adds"
7053,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The seats of Hell, the lofty gates of Pluto,"
7054,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Penance for sin: Catiline, with the Furies"
7055,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Making him cower; farther off, the good,"
7056,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,With Cato giving laws. And all this scene
7057,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Bound with the likeness of the swelling ocean,"
7058,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Blue water and whitecap, where the dolphins playing"
7059,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Leap with a curve of silver. In the center
7060,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Actium, the ships of bronze, Leucate burning"
7061,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Hot with the glow of war, and waves on fire"
7062,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,With molten gold. Augustus Caesar stands
7063,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,High on the lofty stern; his temples flame
7064,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"With double fire, and over his head there dawns"
7065,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,His father’s star. Agrippa leads a column
7066,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"With favoring wind and god, the naval garland"
7067,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Wreathing his temples. Antony assembles
7068,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Egypt and all the East; Antony, victor"
7069,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Over the lands of dawn and the Red Sea,"
7070,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Marshals the foes of Rome, himself a Roman,"
7071,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,With--horror!--an Egyptian wife. The surge
7072,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Boils under keel, the oar-blades churn the waters,"
7073,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The triple-pointed beaks drive through the billows,"
7074,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"You would think that mountains swam and battled mountains,"
7075,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,That islands were uprooted in their anger.
7076,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Fireballs and shafts of steel are slanting showers,"
7077,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,The fields of Neptune redden with the slaughter.
7078,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The queen drives on her warriors, unseeing"
7079,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,The double snakes of death; rattle and cymbals
7080,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Compete with bugle and trumpet. Monstrous gods,"
7081,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Of every form and fashion, one, Anubis,"
7082,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Shaped like a dog, wield their outrageous weapons"
7083,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"In wrath at Venus, Neptune, and Minerva."
7084,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Mars, all in steel, storms through the fray; the Furies"
7085,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Swoop from the sky; Discord exults; Bellona,"
7086,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"With bloody scourge, comes lashing; and Apollo"
7087,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"From Actium bends his bow. Egypt and India,"
7088,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Sabaeans and Arabians, flee in terror."
7089,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And the contagion takes the queen, who loosens"
7090,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The sheets to slackness, courts the wind, in terror,"
7091,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Pale at the menace of death. And the Nile comes
7092,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"To meet her, a protecting god, his mantle"
7093,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Spread wide, to bring a beaten woman home."
7094,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And Caesar enters Rome triumphant, bringing"
7095,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Immortal offerings, three times a hundred"
7096,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,New altars through the city. Streets are loud
7097,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"With gladness, games, rejoicing; all the temples"
7098,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Are filled with matrons praying at the altars,"
7099,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Are heaped with solemn sacrifice. And Caesar,"
7100,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Seated before Apollo’s shining threshold,"
7101,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Reviews the gifts, and hangs them on the portals."
7102,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"In long array the conquered file, their garments,"
7103,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Their speech, as various as their arms, the Nomads,"
7104,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"The naked Africans, Leleges, Carians,"
7105,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Gelonians with quivers, the Morini,"
7106,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Of mortals most remote, Euphrates moving"
7107,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"With humbler waves, the two-mouthed Rhine, Araxes,"
7108,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,Chafing beneath his bridge.
7109,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,
7110,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,All this Aeneas
7111,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"Sees on his mother’s gift, the shield of Vulcan,"
7112,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"And, without understanding, is proud and happy"
7113,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,"As he lifts to his shoulder all that fortune,"
7114,AENEAS AT THE SITE OF ROME,The fame and glory of his children’s children.

7122,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7123,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7124,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"While all this happened far away, queen Juno"
7125,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Sent Iris down from heaven to bold Turnus.
7126,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"She found him resting in a sacred valley,"
7127,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Pilumnus’ grove, his ancestor; all radiant"
7128,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"She spoke to him:--“No god would promise, Turnus,"
7129,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"This answer to your prayers, but the turn of time"
7130,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Has put it in your hands. Aeneas has gone,"
7131,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Leaving the town, the fleet, and his companions,"
7132,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Seeking the realm of Palatine Evander,"
7133,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And more than that: he has won some cities over,"
7134,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,He calls the Etruscan countrymen to arms.
7135,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,What are you waiting for? Now is the time
7136,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"For chariot and horse. Break off delay,"
7137,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Take the bewildered camp!” She spoke, and rose"
7138,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Skyward on even wings, and under the clouds"
7139,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Cut her great soaring arc. And Turnus knew her,"
7140,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And raised his hands to the sky, and followed her flight:--"
7141,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"“O Iris, pride of heaven, who sent you to me"
7142,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Through clouds to earth? Whence comes this storm of brightness?
7143,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"I see the heavens part, and the stars wheeling"
7144,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Across the sky. I follow these great omens,"
7145,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Whoever calls to arms.” And, with the word,"
7146,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"He went to the stream, took water up, prayed often,"
7147,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Making his vows to all the gods of heaven.
7148,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7149,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And now, over all the plain, the army was coming,"
7150,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Rich in caparison, and rich in horses,"
7151,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"In gold and broidered robes, Messapus leading,"
7152,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And Turnus in the center, and Tyrrhus’ sons"
7153,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,As captains in the rear: they stream as Ganges
7154,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Streams when his seven quiet tides flood over,"
7155,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Or Nile resents his deep confining channel.
7156,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The Trojans see the sudden cloud, black dust"
7157,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Thickening over the plain, and darkness rising,"
7158,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And Caicus cries from the rampart:--“What is this,"
7159,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"O fellow-citizens, this rolling darkness?"
7160,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Bring the swords quickly, bring weapons, climb the walls,"
7161,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Here comes the enemy, yea! Hurry, hurry!”"
7162,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Trojans, and noise, pour through the gates together."
7163,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Men fill the walls. For so, on his departure,"
7164,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Aeneas had given orders: if something happened,"
7165,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"They should not risk a battle in the open,"
7166,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"They should only guard the camp, protect the ramparts."
7167,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"So, much as they would love to mix in battle,"
7168,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Anger and shame give way to prompt obedience.
7169,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,They bar the gates; protected by their towers
7170,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"They wait while the foe comes on. And Turnus, riding"
7171,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Impatient past his dawdling column, is there"
7172,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Before the city knows it. He has twenty
7173,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Fast riders with him, his mount a piebald Thracian,"
7174,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"His helmet gold with crimson crest. He cries,"
7175,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,“Who will be first with me? Will anybody
7176,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Be first with me against them? Let them have it!”
7177,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And with the word, he lets the javelin fly,"
7178,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,First sign of battle; and they cheer and follow
7179,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And wonder a little at the Trojans, cowards"
7180,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Who dare not fight in the open, man to man,"
7181,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Who hug their walls for comfort. Round and round,"
7182,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Turnus, a wild man, rides, seeking an entrance,"
7183,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,But there is no way in. He is like a wolf
7184,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Lurking about a sheep-fold, snarling at midnight"
7185,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Beside the pens, enduring wind and rain,"
7186,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"While the bleating lambs are safe beneath the ewes,"
7187,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And he, unable to get at them, rages"
7188,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Fierce and dry-throated in the drive of hunger;
7189,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"So Turnus looks at wall and camp, and passion"
7190,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Burns hot within him, burns to his very bones."
7191,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,How to get in? or how to yank the Trojans
7192,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Out of their cloister, smear them over the plain?"
7193,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Ah, but the fleet is there, beside the camp,"
7194,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Sheltered by earthworks and the flowing river:
7195,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"There lies the chance! He calls for fire, he hurls it,"
7196,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The burning torch, and his hand, almost, is burning,"
7197,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And all of them pitch in--Turnus has shown them,"
7198,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And Turnus eggs them on--they are armed with firebrands,"
7199,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,They rob the hearths; the tar flares lurid yellow
7200,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Against the grey of the cloud, the soot and ashes."
7201,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7202,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"What god, O Muses, turned the fire? Who saved"
7203,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The Trojan ships? Remind me--the story is old,"
7204,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Men have believed it long, its glory endless."
7205,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"When first Aeneas built the fleet on Ida,"
7206,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Preparing for deep seas, the mother of gods,"
7207,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Queen Cybele, spoke to Jove:--“Grant me, my son,"
7208,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Lord of Olympus now, a mother’s prayer."
7209,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"I had a pine-wood on the mountain-top,"
7210,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And men, for many years, brought offerings there,"
7211,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"I loved that forest, dark with fir and maple,"
7212,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"But when the Trojan lacked a fleet, I gave him"
7213,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,My timber gladly; now my heart is troubled.
7214,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Relieve my fear, and let a mother’s pleading"
7215,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Keep them from wreck on any course, unshaken"
7216,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"By any whirlwind. Grown upon our mountains,"
7217,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"They should have privilege.” Her son, the swayer"
7218,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Of the stars of the world, replied, “What call, O mother,"
7219,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Is this you make on fate? What are you seeking?
7220,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Should keels laid down by mortal hand have title
7221,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,To life immortal? Should Aeneas travel
7222,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Through danger, unendangered? Such power is given"
7223,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,No god in heaven. But I make this promise:
7224,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"After their course is run, after the harbors"
7225,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"In Italy receive them, safe from ocean,"
7226,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And with Aeneas landed in Laurentum,"
7227,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"I will take away their mortal shape, I will make them"
7228,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Goddesses of the sea, like Nereus’ daughter,"
7229,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Like Galatea, the nymphs who breast the foam.”"
7230,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"So Jupiter promised, and, as gods do, took oath,"
7231,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"By the rivers of his brother under the world,"
7232,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The banks that seethe with the black pitchy torrent,"
7233,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,And made Olympus tremble with his nod.
7234,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7235,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The promised day had come, the fates had finished"
7236,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The allotted span, when Turnus’ desecration"
7237,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Warned Cybele to keep the torch and firebrand
7238,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Far from her holy vessels. A new light blazed
7239,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"In mortal sight, and from the east a cloud"
7240,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Ran across heaven, and choirs from Ida followed,"
7241,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And a dread voice came down the air:--“O Trojans,"
7242,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Be in no hurry to defend my vessels,"
7243,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"You have no need of arms; Turnus, most surely,"
7244,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Will burn the seas before he burns these pine-trees.
7245,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Go forth in freedom, goddesses of ocean,"
7246,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,The Mother wills it so.” And each ship parted
7247,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Cable from bank, and dove to the deep water"
7248,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"As dolphins dive, and reappeared as maiden,--"
7249,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Oh marvel!--and all of them bore out to ocean.
7250,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7251,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Rutulian hearts were stunned, their captains shaken,"
7252,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Their steeds confused and frightened; even Tiber
7253,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Shrank back from the sea, and the murmuring stream protested."
7254,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"But Turnus kept his nerve, his words rang loud"
7255,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,In challenge to their courage:--“These are portents
7256,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,To make the Trojans timid; Jove has taken
7257,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Their comfort from them; the ships they always fled in
7258,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Run from Rutulian fire and sword; the oceans
7259,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Are pathless for the Trojans now, their hope"
7260,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Of flight all gone: half of their world is taken,"
7261,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And the earth is in our hands, Italians, thousands,"
7262,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Thousands of us in arms. I am not frightened,"
7263,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,However they boast of oracles from heaven.
7264,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Venus and fate have had their share: the Trojans
7265,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Have done enough even to touch our richness,"
7266,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The Ausonian fields. I have my omens, also,"
7267,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"To match with theirs, a sword to slay the guilty,"
7268,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Death for the rape of brides! Not Atreus’ sons,"
7269,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Not only Menelaus and Mycenae,"
7270,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Know what this hurt can be, this need for vengeance,"
7271,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"This right to take up arms. Once to have perished,"
7272,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"They tell us, is enough. Once to have sinned"
7273,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Ought to have been enough and more. Hereafter
7274,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"All women should be hateful to them, cowards"
7275,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Hiding behind the sheltering moat and rampart,"
7276,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,The little barriers that give them courage!
7277,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Have they not seen the walls that Neptune built them
7278,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Sink in the fires? Which one of you is ready,"
7279,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Brave hearts, to slash their barriers with the sword,"
7280,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,To join me in the onrush? I do not need
7281,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The arms of Vulcan, nor a thousand vessels"
7282,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Against the Trojans. Let them have Etruria!
7283,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"One thing, at least, they need not fear,--the darkness,"
7284,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The sneaking theft of their Palladium image,"
7285,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Guards slain in the dark, hiders in horse’s belly;"
7286,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"I fight in open daylight, I have fire"
7287,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"To put around their walls, I will teach them something,--"
7288,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Their business now is not with those Greek heroes
7289,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Whom Hector kept at bay for ten long years.
7290,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Now day is almost over; you have done
7291,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Good work; rest now; be happy, be preparing,"
7292,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Be hopeful for the battles of to-morrow.”
7293,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7294,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Meanwhile, the guards were posted, under orders"
7295,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Of Messapus, their officer; and the walls"
7296,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Were ringed with fire. Fourteen Rutulian captains
7297,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Led, each, a hundred men, bright in their gold,"
7298,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Plumed in their crimson, on patrol or resting,"
7299,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Or sprawling on the grass, gambling or drinking;"
7300,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The fires burn bright, the sentinels are watchful."
7301,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7302,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Above them, from the wall, the Trojans, waiting,"
7303,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Maintain the heights with arms, and, anxious, test"
7304,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The strength of the gates, link bridge and battlement,"
7305,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Warriors in harness. Mnestheus and Serestus
7306,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Urge on the work; they were to be the leaders,"
7307,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Aeneas said, in the event of trouble."
7308,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Along the walls the host mounts guard; they share
7309,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Relief and danger in turn, each at his post."
7310,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7311,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Nisus, quick-handed with the javelin"
7312,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And the light arrows, very keen in arms,"
7313,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Stood guard beside the gate, Nisus, a son"
7314,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Of Hyrtacus, sent by the huntress Ida"
7315,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,To join Aeneas; and near-by his friend
7316,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Euryalus; no Trojan was more handsome
7317,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Than he was, that first bloom of youth. They shared"
7318,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Assignments always, side by side in the charge,"
7319,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,And side by side defenders. Here they were
7320,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Together on sentry-duty at the gate.
7321,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Nisus burst out:--“Euryalus, what is it?"
7322,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Do the gods put this ardor in our hearts
7323,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Or does each man’s desire become his god?
7324,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"I want much more than this, I am not contented"
7325,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,With all this peace and calm; my mind keeps calling
7326,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"To battle, or something big. Look! The Rutulians"
7327,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Are far too confident: their lights are scattered;
7328,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,They lie asleep or drunk; and all is silent.
7329,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Listen! I have a plan. People and fathers
7330,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Demand Aeneas, ask that men be sent him"
7331,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,With information. If I can make them promise
7332,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,To let you go--(the glory of the action
7333,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Is all I want myself)--I think that I
7334,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Can find the way around that hill, can manage"
7335,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,To reach the walls and fort of Pallanteum.”
7336,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,This shook Euryalus: a great love of praise
7337,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Spoke in his answer to his eager comrade:--
7338,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"“What, Nisus? Are you planning to leave me out"
7339,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"In this bold scheme, planning to go alone"
7340,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Into such dangers? No; no, no. I am"
7341,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Opheltes’ son, a warrior trained among"
7342,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Greek terror and Trojan suffering; and I follow,"
7343,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"With you, great-souled Aeneas and his fortunes."
7344,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"I have a spirit, not too fond of living,"
7345,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Not too dissatisfied to buy with death
7346,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,The honor that you strive for.” Nisus answered:--
7347,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"“I had no fear on your account, be certain;"
7348,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"That would be shameless of me: so may Jove,"
7349,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Or any god that looks on this with favor,"
7350,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Bring me back home triumphant. But disaster,"
7351,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"As well you know, or god, or chance, might take me:"
7352,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"If so, your youth being worthier, I’d have you"
7353,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Be my survivor, give to earth my body,"
7354,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Rescued or ransomed, or pay the final honor"
7355,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"To, it might be, an empty tomb. I would not"
7356,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Cause sorrow to the only woman of many
7357,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Who scorned Acestes’ city, and came on"
7358,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"With you, her only son.” But then the other"
7359,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Replied:--“There is no use in all this talking.
7360,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"My mind is fixed, and we had better hurry.”"
7361,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,He roused the guards; new men came on; together
7362,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Euryalus and Nisus seek their leader.
7363,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7364,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,All other creatures over all the world
7365,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Were easing their troubles in slumber, and hearts forgot"
7366,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Sorrow and pain; not so the Trojan leaders
7367,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Meeting in council. Here were things of moment;
7368,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,What should they do? how would they reach Aeneas?
7369,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"They stood there, leaning on long spears, most gravely,"
7370,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Holding their shields. Euryalus and Nisus
7371,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Crave instant audience; the matter is urgent,"
7372,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"They say, and worth a little interruption."
7373,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Iulus takes the lead, meets their impatience,"
7374,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Tells Nisus to speak out. “Give us a hearing,"
7375,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"O men of Troy,” says Nisus, “do not hold"
7376,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Our years against us: we have something for you.
7377,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"All the Rutulians are drunk or sleeping,"
7378,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"They are quiet now. There is a place, we know it,"
7379,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"We have seen it with our eyes, a place that cunning"
7380,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Can take advantage of: you know the gate
7381,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Nearest the sea, and how the road splits off there."
7382,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The watchfires there die down, and the black smoke rises"
7383,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Dark to the sky out there. Give us a chance!
7384,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Let us go to find Aeneas and Pallanteum.
7385,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,You will see us here again; it will not be long
7386,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Till we come back, weighed down with spoil. We will kill them."
7387,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,We will not miss the way; we have seen the city
7388,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Far in the distant valleys. We go hunting
7389,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Along here often; we know all the river.
7390,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"We know it all by heart.” And old Aletes,"
7391,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"A wise man in a council, gave the answer:--"
7392,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"“Gods of our ancestors, under whose guidance"
7393,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Troy is and has been, always, our destruction"
7394,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Must be far off, seeing your care has brought us"
7395,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Young men of such high heart and lofty spirit.”
7396,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"In deep emotion, his hands reached out for theirs,"
7397,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"His arms went round their shoulders. “What can I give you,"
7398,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Young men,” he cried, “worthy your praise and glory?"
7399,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The best rewards come from the gods, the finest"
7400,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"From your own character, but good Aeneas"
7401,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Will not forget your service, and your peer"
7402,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"In age, Ascanius, surely will remember.”"
7403,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And that young man broke in, “Most truly, Nisus,"
7404,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,I trust my fortune to you. My only safety
7405,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Lies in my sire’s return. By all our gods,"
7406,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"I beg you both, I pray, bring back my father."
7407,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Our trouble goes when he is here. I promise
7408,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Two silver wine-cups, captured from Arisba,"
7409,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"A pair of tripods, two great talents of gold,"
7410,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"An ancient bowl, the present of queen Dido."
7411,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And if we capture Italy, if we live"
7412,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"To wield the sceptre and divide the spoil,"
7413,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"You know the horse that Turnus rides, the armor"
7414,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"He carries on his back, all gold--that armor,"
7415,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The shield, the crimson plumes, and the war-horse, Nisus,"
7416,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Are your reward; even now, I so declare them."
7417,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"My father will give twelve women, beautiful captives,"
7418,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And captive men, equipped with arms, and land"
7419,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Now held by king Latinus; and I cherish
7420,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"With all my heart, Euryalus, your courage."
7421,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Your years are near my own, and all my life"
7422,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Your glory will be mine; in peace or war,"
7423,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"In word and deed, I trust in you, completely.”"
7424,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Euryalus replied:--“No day will ever
7425,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Prove me unworthy of brave deeds, if fortune"
7426,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Is kind, not cruel, to me. I ask one thing"
7427,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Better than any gift: I have a mother
7428,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Of Priam’s ancient line, and she came with me,"
7429,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Poor soul, from Troy, and king Acestes’ city"
7430,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Was powerless to keep her. I leave her now
7431,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"With never a word about what I am doing,"
7432,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Whatever its danger is, with no farewell."
7433,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"I cannot bear a mother’s tears. I beg you,"
7434,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Comfort her helplessness, relieve her sorrow."
7435,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Let me take with me that much hope; it will help me
7436,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Face any risk more boldly.” They were weeping
7437,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"At this, the Trojans, all of them, Iulus"
7438,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,More deeply touched than any. And he spoke:--
7439,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"“Be reassured, Euryalus; all we do"
7440,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Will prove as worthy as your glorious mission.
7441,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Your mother shall be mine, in all but name;"
7442,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Great honor waits the mother of a son
7443,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"So great in honor. Whatever fortune follows,"
7444,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"I vow and swear it, with an oath as solemn"
7445,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"As any my father ever took, I promise,"
7446,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"When you return to us, safe and successful,"
7447,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Your triumph and your glory and your prizes
7448,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Shall be for her as well, for all your house.”"
7449,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"He spoke with tears, and from his sword-belt took"
7450,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"A present in farewell, the golden sword,"
7451,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The ivory scabbard, wonderfully fashioned"
7452,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,By old Lycaon’s talent; Mnestheus gave
7453,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"A lion-skin to Nisus, and Aletes"
7454,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Exchanged his helmet with him. As they started,"
7455,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"All the great company, young men and old ones,"
7456,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Went with them to the gate, and out beyond it"
7457,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The hopeful prayers attended them. Iulus,"
7458,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Mature beyond his years, gave many a message"
7459,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"To carry to Aeneas, but the winds"
7460,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Bore these away and swept them off to cloudland.
7461,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7462,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And now they have crossed the trench, and through night’s shadow"
7463,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Invade the hostile camp; they are bound to be
7464,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,The doom of many. They see the bodies sprawling
7465,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"In drunken sleep, the chariots half turned over,"
7466,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Men lying under the wheels and among the reins,"
7467,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And Nisus whispers:--“Euryalus, we must"
7468,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Be bold; the chance is given; here lies our way.
7469,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Watch and keep back, lest some one steal upon us"
7470,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Along the trail behind. I lead, you follow"
7471,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Where I have cut the way; it will be a broad one.”
7472,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,His voice was silent; and he drew the sword
7473,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"At Rhamnes, cushioned on high covers, lying"
7474,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"In a deep slumber, breathing deep, a king"
7475,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And Turnus’ favorite augur, but his doom"
7476,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,No augury prevented. Nisus struck
7477,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Three slaves, and then the armor-bearer of Remus,"
7478,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,And Remus’ charioteer--their necks were severed
7479,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"With steel, and their lord Remus was beheaded."
7480,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The trunk spurts blood, the earth and couch are darkened"
7481,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"With blood, black-flowing. Lamyrus and Lamus"
7482,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Are slain, and young Serranus, handsome gambler"
7483,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Who had won high stakes that night, and slept contented"
7484,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Smiling at the gods’ favor, luckier surely"
7485,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,If he had lost all night. A starving lion
7486,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Loose in a sheepfold with the crazy hunger
7487,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Urging him on, gnashing and dragging, raging"
7488,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"With bloody mouth against the fearful feeble,"
7489,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,So Nisus slaughters. And his savage comrade
7490,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Keeps pace with him: Fadus is slain, Herbesus,"
7491,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Rhoetus, Abaris, all of them unconscious,"
7492,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Murdered in sleep. One of them, Rhoetus, wakened"
7493,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"A little, saw, and tried to hide, and crouching"
7494,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Behind a wine-bowl, took the sword, and rose,"
7495,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Stumbled and sprawled and belched, the red life spurting"
7496,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Out of the mouth, red wine, red blood. All hotly"
7497,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Euryalus went on. Messapus’ quarters
7498,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Are next in line; the fires burn low, the horses,"
7499,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Tether-contented, graze. Then, briefly, Nisus,"
7500,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Sensing his comrade’s recklessness in slaughter,"
7501,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Calls:--“Light is near, our enemy; give over,"
7502,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"We have killed enough, we have cut the path we needed."
7503,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,No more of this!” They left behind them armor
7504,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Of solid silver, bowls, rich-woven carpets,"
7505,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,But must take something: Rhamnes’ golden sword-belt
7506,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Euryalus held on to, all that armor"
7507,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"That went with long tradition, from father to son,"
7508,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"From son to enemy, once more a trophy"
7509,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"For young Euryalus. He dons the armor,"
7510,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Picks up, puts on, besides, a shapely helmet,"
7511,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The spoil of Messapus, the long plume flowing."
7512,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"They leave the camp, are on their way to safety."
7513,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7514,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Meanwhile, sent forward from the Latin city,"
7515,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Horsemen were coming, while the legion rested"
7516,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Behind them on the plain, three hundred horsemen"
7517,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"With word for Turnus, under their captain Volcens,"
7518,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,All armed with shields and riding at the ready.
7519,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"They are near the camp, the wall, and in the distance"
7520,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"See two men turning left along a pathway,"
7521,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And a helmet glittering among the shadows,"
7522,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Euryalus’ prize and foolishness. They notice
7523,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"At once, of course, and challenge. From the column"
7524,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Volcens cried out:--“Halt! Who goes there? Who are you?
7525,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,What are you doing in arms? Upon what mission?”
7526,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,No answer: flight to wood and trust in darkness.
7527,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"But the horsemen, fanning out, block every cross-road,"
7528,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Circle and screen each outlet. Wide with brambles
7529,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,And dark with holm-oak spreads the wood; the briars
7530,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Fill it on every side, but the path glimmers"
7531,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,In the rare intervals between the shadows.
7532,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Euryalus is hindered by the branches,"
7533,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The darkness, and the spoil he carries; terror"
7534,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Makes him mistake the path. Nisus is clear,"
7535,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Reaching the site that later men called Alba,"
7536,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Where king Latinus had his lofty stables.
7537,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"He halts, looks back to find his friend: in vain."
7538,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"“Euryalus, Euryalus, where are you?"
7539,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Where have I lost you? How am I to follow
7540,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Back through the tangled wood, the treacherous thickets?"
7541,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Euryalus, Euryalus!” He turns,"
7542,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Tries to retrace his step, is lost in the woods,"
7543,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And hears the horses, hears the shouts and signals"
7544,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"As the pursuit comes closer, and he hears"
7545,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"A cry, he sees Euryalus, dragged along"
7546,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Out of the treason of the night and darkness,"
7547,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Bewildered by the uproar, fighting vainly"
7548,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,In the hands of Volcens’ squadron. There is nothing
7549,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Nisus can do, or is there? With what arms,"
7550,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"What force, redeem his friend? Or is it better"
7551,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"To hurl himself to death, dash in, regardless,"
7552,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"To glorious wounds? His spear is poised, his arm"
7553,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Drawn back; he looks to the moon on high, and prays:--"
7554,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"“Dear goddess, daughter of Latona, aid me,"
7555,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Pride of the stars and glory of the groves,"
7556,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,If ever my father Hyrtacus brought honors
7557,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"In my name to the altar, if ever I"
7558,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Have brought gifts home from my own hunting, aid me!"
7559,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Let me confound that troop, direct my weapon!”"
7560,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,The straining body flung the spear; it whistled
7561,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Across the shadow of night, and Sulmo took it"
7562,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,In his turned back; the point snaps off; it lodges
7563,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,With part of the splintered wood deep in the lungs.
7564,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Sulmo goes down, his mouth spurts blood, his body"
7565,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Sobs, straining, in the gasp and chill and shudder"
7566,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Of a cold death. They look in all directions,"
7567,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"See nothing. And another spear is flying,"
7568,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Fiercer this time. This pierces Tagus’ temples,"
7569,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Clings, warm, in the split brain. And Volcens rages,"
7570,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And cannot find the spearman, and his anger"
7571,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Has no sure place to go, but for his vengeance"
7572,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Turns on Euryalus, sword drawn, and rushing"
7573,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"He cries:--“You will pay for both of them, your blood"
7574,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Be the atonement.” Nisus, from the darkness,"
7575,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Shrieks in his terror:--“Here I am, I did it,"
7576,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The guilt is mine, let him alone, come get me,"
7577,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Rutulians! How could he have dared or done it?
7578,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"God knows, the only thing he did was love"
7579,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,A luckless friend too well.” But the sword is driven
7580,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Deep in the breast. Euryalus rolls over,"
7581,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Blood veins the handsome limbs, and on the shoulder"
7582,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The neck droops over, as a bright-colored flower"
7583,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Droops when the ploughshare bends it, or as poppies"
7584,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Sink under the weight of heavy summer rainfall.
7585,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And Nisus rushes them; he is after Volcens,"
7586,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Volcens alone. They mass around him, cluster,"
7587,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Batter him back, but through them all he charges,"
7588,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Whirling the blade like fire, until he drives it"
7589,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Full in the face while the Rutulian, shrieking,"
7590,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Goes down, and Nisus, dying, sees him die,"
7591,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Falls over his lifeless friend, and there is quiet"
7592,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,In the utter peace of death.
7593,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7594,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Fortunate boys!
7595,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"If there is any power in my verses,"
7596,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,You will not be forgotten in time and story
7597,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"While rock stands firm beneath the Capitol,"
7598,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,While the imperial house maintains dominion.
7599,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7600,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"With victory and tears, with spoil and plunder,"
7601,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"They brought Rutulian Volcens home to camp-ground,"
7602,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And a great wail arose, for Rhamnes slaughtered,"
7603,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"For Numa, for Serranus, for so many"
7604,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Slain in one fight. They rush to see the bodies,"
7605,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"To heroes dead or dying, to the ground"
7606,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Reeking with carnage, the red foaming rivers."
7607,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"They recognize the spoil, the shining helmet"
7608,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Brought back for Messapus, and all the trappings"
7609,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,It cost them sweat to win.
7610,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7611,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,And the Dawn-goddess
7612,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Came from her husband’s saffron couch, bestowing"
7613,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Fresh light across the world. Turnus, in armor,"
7614,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Summoned his men to arms, and every leader"
7615,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Marshalled his ranks of bronze, and each man sharpens"
7616,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,His anger with one rumor or another.
7617,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And more than that, a pitiful sight, they fix"
7618,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"On spears upraised, and follow with loud shouting,"
7619,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,The heads of Nisus and Euryalus.
7620,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,On the left of the wall the Trojans form their line
7621,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Whose right rests on the river. They hold the trenches,"
7622,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Stand on the high towers, sorrowing; they know,"
7623,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And all too well, those heads with spears for bodies,"
7624,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,And the black blood running down.
7625,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7626,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,And meanwhile Rumor
7627,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Goes flying through the panic of the city,"
7628,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Comes to Euryalus’ mother. That poor woman
7629,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Is cold as death; the shuttle falls from her hands,"
7630,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The yarn is all unwound. She rushes, shrieking,"
7631,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Tearing her hair, out to the walls, in frenzy,"
7632,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Heedless of men, heedless of darts and danger"
7633,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,To fill the air with terrible lamentation:--
7634,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"“Is this thing you I see, Euryalus?"
7635,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Could you, a poor old woman’s only comfort,"
7636,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Leave her to loneliness? O cruel, cruel!"
7637,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"To go to danger, and never a farewell word"
7638,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Between the mother and son! And now you lie
7639,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"On a strange land for dogs and birds to pick at,"
7640,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"No mother to bathe the wounds, or close the eyes,"
7641,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,To veil the body with the robe I worked on
7642,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"For quite another purpose, night and day,"
7643,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Comforting, so, the cares of age. Where can I"
7644,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Go now, to find you? In what land are lying"
7645,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The limbs, dismembered, and the mangled body?"
7646,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Is this thing all you bring me from the wars,"
7647,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Is this what I have followed on land and sea?
7648,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"If you have anything of decent feeling,"
7649,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Rutulians, kill me; hurl your weapons on me,"
7650,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"All of you, all of them: let steel destroy me."
7651,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Or, father of the gods, have pity on me"
7652,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,And strike with the bolt of lightning; hurl to Hell
7653,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,The life I hate; no other way is left me
7654,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,To break the cruel thread.” And at her wailing
7655,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The Trojan spirit sank, and a groan of sorrow"
7656,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Passed through the ranks, their will to battle broken."
7657,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"She kindles mourning; the leaders give an order,"
7658,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Idaeus and Actor, taking her between them,"
7659,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Lead her away.
7660,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7661,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,And the loud terrible trumpet
7662,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Blared in bronze-throated challenge, and the shouting"
7663,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Rose to the sky. And on they came, the Volscians"
7664,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Under their tortoise-shield, in a wild hurry"
7665,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"To fill the moat, tear down the wall: some sought"
7666,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"A quick way in, or over, with scaling-ladders"
7667,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Where the ring of men is thin, and light breaks in"
7668,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Where no men stand. And in reply the Trojans
7669,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Rain every kind of weapon down--long war
7670,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Has taught them how the walls must be defended.
7671,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"They use crude poles to push men off the ladders,"
7672,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,They roll tremendous boulders to crush the ranks
7673,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Covered by shields, and glad of that protection,"
7674,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Too little now, too small for the great rock"
7675,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,The Trojans heave and pry and dump down on them
7676,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Where the clump of men is thickest. The back of the tortoise
7677,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Is broken, like the bodies of men beneath it."
7678,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"No more blind war, like this, for the Rutulians!"
7679,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"They change their tactics, sweep the wall with arrows,"
7680,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Mezentius, grim to look at, works with firebrands,"
7681,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"While Neptune’s son, Messapus, tamer of horses,"
7682,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Keeps tearing at the walls, and screaming for ladders."
7683,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7684,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Help me, Calliope, with the song: what killing"
7685,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Turnus dealt out that day, the roll of victims"
7686,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Whom every warrior sent to Hell: O, aid me"
7687,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"To unfold it all, the war’s great panorama."
7688,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7689,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"There was a tower, high overhead, well chosen"
7690,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"To suit the ground, equipped with lofty gangways;"
7691,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,On this the Italians spent their every effort
7692,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"To tear it down, the Trojans to defend it"
7693,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"With stones from above, and arrows through the loopholes."
7694,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"A firebrand, flung by Turnus, found a lodging"
7695,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Along one side, and the wind blew and fanned it,"
7696,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And lintel and planking burned, and the men huddled"
7697,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Within, and found no way to flee, and shifted"
7698,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Toward the undamaged portion, when all of a sudden,"
7699,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Lopsided under the weight, it toppled crashing"
7700,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,And filled all heaven with thunder. Half dead already
7701,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Men reached the ground, and the tower came down upon them,"
7702,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Pierced through and through by shafts of their own making,"
7703,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Their chests transfixed by jagged broken timbers.
7704,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Two manage to escape, Lycus, Helenor,"
7705,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The latter a young warrior, the son"
7706,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Of a Maeonian king and a slave-girl mother,"
7707,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Who sent him off to Troy in arms (forbidden,"
7708,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Since arms were not for slaves), a naked sword,"
7709,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,A shield with no device. He saw himself
7710,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Now in the midst of Turnus’ thousands, marshalled"
7711,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Before him and behind him. There he stood
7712,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Like a wild animal, ringed in by hunters,"
7713,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Raging against their weapons, and sure of death,"
7714,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Leaping upon them,--so Helenor, certain"
7715,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"To die, rushed where the weapons were the thickest."
7716,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Lycus was swifter afoot: through men, through weapons,"
7717,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"He gained the wall, reached up to pull himself over,"
7718,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Reached up for hands to help him. But Turnus came
7719,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Hot on his heels:--“You fool,” he cried in triumph,"
7720,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"“Did you think you were out of reach?” And as he hung there,"
7721,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Turnus grabbed him, tore him loose, and the wall came with him."
7722,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"An eagle, so, sweeps up again to heaven"
7723,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,With a white swan or rabbit in his talons;
7724,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Or so a wolf snatches a lamb from the sheepfold
7725,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,To the bleating of the ewe. A shout arises;
7726,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Men from all sides come on; they fill the trenches,"
7727,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Keep firebrands flying at the tower and rooftop.
7728,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Ilioneus knocks over one, Lucetius,"
7729,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Who came to the gates with fire; he bowled him over
7730,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,With a rock as big as a mountain. Liger slew
7731,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Emathion with a javelin; Asilas
7732,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Shot Corynaeus down. Caeneus won
7733,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Over Ortygius, lost to Turnus. Turnus"
7734,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Killed half a dozen, Clonius, Dioxippus,"
7735,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Itys, Promolus, Sagaris, and Idas."
7736,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Capys cut down Privernus: a spear had grazed him,"
7737,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And the fool had flung his shield aside, to carry"
7738,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"His hand to his side, and an arrow pinned it there,"
7739,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And went on through, a mortal wound in the bowels."
7740,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"A young man in the battle, the son of Arcens,"
7741,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Stood out conspicuous in arms, a tunic"
7742,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Embroidered bright, Iberian blue; his father"
7743,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Had sent him from his mother’s grove along
7744,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Symaethus stream and Palicus’ rich altars.
7745,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Mezentius saw him there, laid down his spear,"
7746,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Whirled the sling thrice around his head, let fly,"
7747,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And the slug of the sling-shot split the victim’s temples,"
7748,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Stretching his blue in the deep yellow sand.
7749,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7750,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Then, so they say, was the first time Iulus"
7751,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Brought down a man in war; he had hunted only
7752,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Wild beasts, before this time, with bow and arrows."
7753,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"There was a youngster, Remulus by name,"
7754,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Or, it might be, Numanus, lately married"
7755,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"To Turnus’ younger sister, very proud"
7756,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,And pleased with his new royalty. He strode
7757,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Along the foremost battle-line, and taunted,"
7758,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Shouting indecencies, a swollen hero:--"
7759,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"“What, once again, O Phrygians twice-besieged?"
7760,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Have you no shame, to hide behind the ramparts"
7761,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"A second time, a second time with walls"
7762,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,To ward off death? Look at the silly warriors
7763,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Who claim our brides with steel! What god, what madness,"
7764,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Brought you to Italy? No sons of Atreus
7765,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Are here, no lying glib Ulysses. We"
7766,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Are a tough race, we bring our new-born sons"
7767,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"To the ice-cold river, dip them in to make them"
7768,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Tough as their fathers, make them wake up early"
7769,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"To hunt till they wear the forests out; they ride,"
7770,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"They shoot, and love it; they tame the earth, they battle"
7771,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Till cities fall: and all our life is iron,"
7772,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The spear, reversed, prods on the ox; old age"
7773,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Pulls on the helmet over the whitest hair;
7774,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"We live on what we plunder, we revel in booty."
7775,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,But you--O wonderful in purple and saffron!--
7776,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Love doing nothing, you delight in dancing,"
7777,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And oh, those fancy clothes, sleeves on the tunics,"
7778,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And ribbons in the bonnets! Phrygian women,"
7779,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"By God, not Phrygian men! Be gone forever"
7780,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Over the heights of Dindymus; pipe and timbrel
7781,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Call you to female rites: leave arms to men,"
7782,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,The sword to warriors!”
7783,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7784,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,But Ascanius loosened
7785,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"An arrow from the quiver, held the shaft"
7786,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Nocked to the bow-string, and with arms outspread"
7787,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"For shot, made prayer:--“Almighty Jupiter,"
7788,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Favor my bold beginning. I shall offer
7789,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,The temple every year a snow-white bullock
7790,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"With gilded horns, a young one, but already"
7791,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Tall as his dam, butting with horn, and pawing"
7792,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The sand with restless hoof.” The father heard him,"
7793,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"There was thunder on the left, and in that instant"
7794,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,The fatal bow-string twanged. The shaft came flying
7795,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Through air, and the steel split the hollow temples"
7796,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Of that young bragger Remulus. “Go on,"
7797,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Mock valor with arrogant words! This is the answer
7798,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The Phrygians twice-besieged, the Phrygian women,"
7799,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Send back to Remulus.” The Trojans cheered him
7800,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,With joyful shouts and spirits raised to heaven.
7801,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7802,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,And it so happened from the realm of sky
7803,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Long-haired Apollo, throned with cloud, looked down"
7804,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And saw the Ausonian battle-lines and city,"
7805,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,And had a word of blessing for Iulus:--
7806,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"“Good for your prowess, youngster! That’s the way"
7807,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"To reach the stars, a son of gods, a father"
7808,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Of gods to be. In time the wars will end
7809,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Under that royal line. Troy sets you free
7810,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"For greater destinies.” And he left the heaven,"
7811,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Came through the stir of air, and sought Iulus,"
7812,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Disguised as ancient Butes, armor-bearer,"
7813,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Once, to Anchises, a guardian at his threshold,"
7814,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Later Ascanius’ servant. With his voice,"
7815,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"His grizzled hair, his color, his sounding arms,"
7816,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Apollo came and spoke to the hot young warrior:--
7817,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"“Let that be plenty, son of great Aeneas:"
7818,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Numanus slain and unavenged; your arrow
7819,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Has done its work. Apollo grants this praise,"
7820,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Your first, and does not envy the little archer."
7821,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"But now, my son, refrain from war.” He vanished,"
7822,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Before the speech was ended, into thin air,"
7823,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And the Trojan captains knew the god, his weapons,"
7824,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The clang of the quiver of the god ascending,"
7825,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,And at his will and order keep Ascanius
7826,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Out of the fight for which he longs, themselves"
7827,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Go back to the work, charge at the jaws of danger."
7828,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The loud cry runs from tower to tower, all down"
7829,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The avenue of the walls, and they bend the bows,"
7830,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,And catapults hum as the great stone goes flying.
7831,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,The ground is sown with weapons; shield and helmet
7832,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Ring with the clanging; the fight is a swell and a surge
7833,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Like the rise of a wind from the west, with rainstorm pelting"
7834,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Hard on the ground, thicker than hail on ocean,"
7835,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,When Jupiter lashes the gales and cloud-burst thunders from heaven.
7836,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7837,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Two young men, tall as pine-trees, tall as hills"
7838,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"That gave them birth, Alcanor’s sons, their mother"
7839,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The Oread Iaera, stood at the gate,"
7840,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Obeying orders, Pandarus and Bitias,"
7841,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And had their own idea, and flung it open,"
7842,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Relying on their arms, an invitation--"
7843,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Here’s open house for all, come in, come in!"
7844,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"To right and left they stood before the towers,"
7845,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Armed with the steel, and with the high plumes tossing,"
7846,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Like twin oaks towering by pleasant rivers.
7847,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The Rutulians saw the entrance open, rushed in,"
7848,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Were beaten back: Haemon, the son of Mars,"
7849,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Tmarus the headstrong, Quercens, Aquicolus"
7850,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Handsome in arms, fled with their columns routed,"
7851,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Or perished in the gateway. And anger mounted
7852,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"In all those battling spirits: the Trojans gathered,"
7853,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Daring in closer combat now, and risking"
7854,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Brief sallies past the walls.
7855,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7856,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Turnus, far off,"
7857,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Raging and rioting, heard the glad tidings"
7858,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Of enemies gone wild with slaughter, gates"
7859,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Flung open wide. Whatever he was doing
7860,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"He broke off gladly, burned with monstrous anger,"
7861,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Rushed to the Trojan gate and those proud brothers.
7862,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Antiphates came to meet him, bastard son"
7863,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Of tall Sarpedon and a Theban mother,"
7864,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And Turnus’ javelin laid him low: it flew,"
7865,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Italian cornel-wood, through the soft air,"
7866,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Lodged in the throat, pierced deep into the chest."
7867,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The wound’s dark hollow filled with foaming red,"
7868,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,The steel grew warm in the lung. And Turnus’ hand
7869,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Brought down Meropes, Erymas, Aphidnus,"
7870,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Then Bitias blazing-eyed and hot in spirit.
7871,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"No javelin brought him down, no common javelin"
7872,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Would ever have killed that giant, but a pikestaff,"
7873,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Rifled and whirring loud, driven like lightning,"
7874,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Cut through the double leather, the double mail"
7875,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"With scales of gold, and the huge limbs sprawl and tumble,"
7876,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Earth groans, and his great shield clangs down above him,"
7877,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The way a pillar of rock comes down, at Baiae,"
7878,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,When men have pried it loose and shoved it over
7879,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Into the ocean, and, crashing down in ruin,"
7880,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"It lies in shallow water, confusion of sea,"
7881,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Eruption of black sand, and the shock of sound"
7882,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Makes the high mountains tremble, and the earth"
7883,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Shudder under the oceans.
7884,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7885,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,And Mars added
7886,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"New strength and spirit to the Latins, raked them"
7887,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"With the sharp sting of the spur, and sent the Trojans"
7888,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Panic and runaway fear. The Latins, given"
7889,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The chance of fight, come on, as the war-god rides them."
7890,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Pandarus, seeing his brother’s fallen body,"
7891,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Seeing the turn of fortune, puts his shoulder"
7892,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"With all his strength to the gate, and slowly, slowly,"
7893,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Swings it on stubborn hinge, to leave his comrades,"
7894,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Many of them, shut out, beyond the rampart,"
7895,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Fighting in desperate battle; others he welcomes
7896,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"As they come pouring in, the fool, not seeing"
7897,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"One of them was no Trojan! That was Turnus,"
7898,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Shut up in the town, as welcome as a tiger"
7899,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Penned in a flock of sheep. And Turnus’ eyes
7900,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Shone with new light, his arms rang loud, his plume"
7901,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Nodded blood-red, and his great shield flashed lightning."
7902,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Sudden confusion fastened on the Trojans;
7903,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"They knew him as he was, gigantic, hateful,"
7904,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"But Pandarus flashed forward toward him, burning"
7905,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"With vengeance for a brother’s death, and shouting:--"
7906,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"“Why, this is not Amata’s bridal palace,"
7907,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Nor yet the center of your father’s city!
7908,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"This is a hostile camp you see here, Turnus,"
7909,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,And not a chance to leave it.” Turnus only
7910,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Smiled at him with untroubled heart:--“Start something,"
7911,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,If there is any fighting spirit in you;
7912,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Come closer; I have a message for king Priam:
7913,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Tell him Achilles was here.” And Pandarus flung
7914,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"His spear, rough-knotted, the unpeeled bark still on it,"
7915,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And the winds bore it off, and Juno parried"
7916,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The threat of the coming wound, and it fastened, harmless,"
7917,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Stuck in the wooden gate.
7918,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7919,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,“And here’s a weapon
7920,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"That will not miss, seeing my right hand swings it,”"
7921,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,And with his answer Turnus rose full height
7922,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"To the sword upraised, and brought it down, and the steel"
7923,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Split the head clean apart between the temples,"
7924,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And Pandarus came crashing down, and the earth"
7925,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Shook underneath his weight, and he lay there, dying,"
7926,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Limbs buckled underneath him, and his armor"
7927,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Spattered with brains, and the head’s halves, divided,"
7928,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Dangling on either shoulder.
7929,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7930,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,And the Trojans
7931,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Ran every way, in rout and sudden terror."
7932,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"That day might well have been their last, that battle"
7933,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"The end of war, had Turnus ever bothered"
7934,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"To break the bars of the gate, let in his comrades."
7935,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,But no: his fury and mad desire of slaughter
7936,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Drove him one way, and one way only, forward."
7937,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"He caught Phaleris, and he hamstrung Gyges,"
7938,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,And snatched their spears and flung them at the Trojans
7939,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Who fled with nothing but their backs for target.
7940,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Juno supplied him fire and strength. He added
7941,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Halys to the dead roster of his comrades,"
7942,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Pierced Phegeus through his shield and mail. Four others,"
7943,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Alcander, Halius, Prytanis, Noemon,"
7944,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Ignorant of his presence, roused the fighters"
7945,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Along the walls, and fell before they knew it."
7946,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Lynceus, calling his comrades, came to meet him,"
7947,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And Turnus, standing higher, slashed and swung,"
7948,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Close in, and the flashing blade swept head and helmet"
7949,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Together from the shoulders; then he slaughtered
7950,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Amycus, hunter of beasts, a clever craftsman"
7951,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"In arming darts with poison; and Aeolus’ son,"
7952,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Clytius; and Cretheus, the Muses’ comrade,"
7953,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Lover of music and song, whose theme was always"
7954,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Warfare and warhorse, arms of men, and battle."
7955,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7956,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And the Trojan leaders heard about the slaughter,"
7957,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And met, Serestus, keen in arms, and Mnestheus,"
7958,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And saw their comrades wheeling and Turnus welcomed,"
7959,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,And Mnestheus tried to halt them:--“Where do you aim
7960,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"That flight?” he cried, “What other ramparts have you?"
7961,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"What walls beyond these walls? Shall one man, circled,"
7962,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Hemmed in on every side, deal out destruction"
7963,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Unscathed through all the city? Will you let him
7964,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Send down to Hell so many brave young fighters?
7965,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"What kind of cowards are you? Have you no pity,"
7966,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"No shame at all, for your unhappy country,"
7967,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Your ancient household gods, and great Aeneas?”"
7968,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,
7969,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"That gave them courage; and the column thickened,"
7970,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And they were firm, and stood. And very slowly"
7971,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Turnus drew back, retreating toward the river,"
7972,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And they came on, more boldly now, with yelling"
7973,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And massing rank on rank, a crowd of hunters"
7974,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"With deadly spears, after a deadly lion,"
7975,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"And the beast they hunt is frightened, but still deadly,"
7976,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Still dangerous, still glaring, and neither anger"
7977,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Nor courage lets him turn his back, and forward"
7978,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"He cannot go, however much he wants to,"
7979,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Through all that press of men and spears. So Turnus,"
7980,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Doubtful, kept stepping back, little by little,"
7981,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Burning, inside, with anger. Two more times"
7982,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"He made a sudden charge, sent the foe flying"
7983,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Along the walls, but they came back, and Juno"
7984,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Dared not assist him further; Jove had sent
7985,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Iris from heaven, with no uncertain message"
7986,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"If Turnus does not leave the Trojan ramparts,"
7987,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"He can no longer hold his own against them,"
7988,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,The shield and sword-arm falter; darts like hail
7989,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Rain down from everywhere. The helmet rings
7990,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Around his temples, and the brass cracks open"
7991,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Under the storm of stones; the horsehair crest
7992,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Is shot away; the boss of the shield is dented;
7993,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Mnestheus, with lightning force, and other Trojans"
7994,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Multiply spears. The sweat all over his body
7995,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Runs in a tarry stream; he cannot breathe.
7996,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"At last, with one great leap, in all his armor,"
7997,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"He plunges into the stream, and Tiber takes him"
7998,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"On the yellow flood, held up by the buoyant water,"
7999,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,"Washing away the stains of war, a hero,"
8000,IN THE ABSENCE OF AENEAS,Returning happily to his warrior-comrades.

8007,ARMS AND THE MAN,ARMS AND THE MAN
8008,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8009,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8010,ARMS AND THE MAN,Meanwhile all-powerful Olympus flings
8011,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The palace open wide: the council meets,"
8012,ARMS AND THE MAN,"At Jove’s command, under the starry dwelling"
8013,ARMS AND THE MAN,"From which he sees all lands, the Trojan camp,"
8014,ARMS AND THE MAN,The Latin people. Between the double doors
8015,ARMS AND THE MAN,They find their places. Jupiter speaks first:--
8016,ARMS AND THE MAN,"“Great dwellers in Heaven, why the change of heart?"
8017,ARMS AND THE MAN,Why do you fight with hostile spirit? I
8018,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Had said, I thought, that Italy and the Trojans"
8019,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Were not to meet in war. Why, then, this brawling"
8020,ARMS AND THE MAN,In face of my command? What fear has driven
8021,ARMS AND THE MAN,This side or that to arms and provocation?
8022,ARMS AND THE MAN,The proper time will come--be in no hurry--
8023,ARMS AND THE MAN,"When Carthage, fierce and wild, will loose destruction"
8024,ARMS AND THE MAN,"On the heights of Rome, and spring the Alps wide open."
8025,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Hate will be lawful then, and ravage, and battle."
8026,ARMS AND THE MAN,"But now, subside; be friendly; accept my order.”"
8027,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8028,ARMS AND THE MAN,"So Jupiter spoke, briefly, but golden Venus"
8029,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Was far from brief in answer:--“O great father,"
8030,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Sovereign of men and destiny forever,"
8031,ARMS AND THE MAN,What other power is there for us to pray to?
8032,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Do you see, I ask you, these Rutulian warriors"
8033,ARMS AND THE MAN,In all their insolence? Have you noticed Turnus
8034,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Riding on horseback through their midst, all swollen,"
8035,ARMS AND THE MAN,With Mars as second? The barricaded walls
8036,ARMS AND THE MAN,No longer shield the Trojans. The battle rages
8037,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Within the gates, on the high towers; the trenches"
8038,ARMS AND THE MAN,Swim deep in blood. Aeneas does not know it;
8039,ARMS AND THE MAN,He is far away. Must siege go on forever?
8040,ARMS AND THE MAN,Is this your will? Another enemy threatens
8041,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The walls of Troy, new-born, another army"
8042,ARMS AND THE MAN,Comes from Aetolian Arpi; Diomedes
8043,ARMS AND THE MAN,Once more attacks the Trojans. Wounds for me
8044,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Are still to come, I well believe; your daughter"
8045,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Waits for a mortal outrage, not the first one."
8046,ARMS AND THE MAN,The Trojans came to Italy: was the coming
8047,ARMS AND THE MAN,"With your consent, by your design? If not,"
8048,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Why, let them pay the penalty, do not help them!"
8049,ARMS AND THE MAN,Or were they following order after order
8050,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Given by gods above, by gods below?"
8051,ARMS AND THE MAN,"If so, who dares to overturn your justice,"
8052,ARMS AND THE MAN,Who dares create new fates? Do I have to mention
8053,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The fleet on fire in Sicily, the winds"
8054,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Let loose by Aeolus, their king, or Iris"
8055,ARMS AND THE MAN,Sent through the clouds? And now she is even rousing--
8056,ARMS AND THE MAN,"This chance she had not yet taken--the shades of Hell,"
8057,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And here is Allecto, suddenly given license"
8058,ARMS AND THE MAN,"In the upper world, and ravaging and raving"
8059,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Through the Italian cities. As for empire,"
8060,ARMS AND THE MAN,I care no more about it. I was hopeful
8061,ARMS AND THE MAN,When fortune still existed. Let the winners
8062,ARMS AND THE MAN,Be those you want to win: have it your way.
8063,ARMS AND THE MAN,If that tough wife of yours will give the Trojans
8064,ARMS AND THE MAN,"No land in all the world, no realm whatever,"
8065,ARMS AND THE MAN,"I beg you, father, by the smoking ruins"
8066,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Of shattered Troy, let me spare one, Iulus,"
8067,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Let him, at least, be saved from war. Aeneas,"
8068,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Of course, will still be tossed on unknown waters,"
8069,ARMS AND THE MAN,Following any course that fortune offers.
8070,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Let me protect his son. I have Amathus,"
8071,ARMS AND THE MAN,"High Paphus and Cythera, Idalia’s groves;"
8072,ARMS AND THE MAN,"There he may live, laying aside his weapons,"
8073,ARMS AND THE MAN,A long inglorious lifetime. Order Carthage
8074,ARMS AND THE MAN,To crush Ausonia with her empire; nothing
8075,ARMS AND THE MAN,Shall interfere with Tyrian towns. Much good
8076,ARMS AND THE MAN,"It did him to escape the plague of war,"
8077,ARMS AND THE MAN,"To have fled through Argive burning, to have exhausted"
8078,ARMS AND THE MAN,"All dangers of the land and the great ocean,"
8079,ARMS AND THE MAN,Looking for Latium and a new-born Troy!
8080,ARMS AND THE MAN,Much good indeed! It would have been much better
8081,ARMS AND THE MAN,For the very soil of Troy and her last ashes
8082,ARMS AND THE MAN,To have been the new foundation for their dwelling.
8083,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Give the poor wretches Simois and Xanthus,"
8084,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Father, once more; I pray you, let the Trojans"
8085,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Live, once again, the fall of Troy!” And Juno"
8086,ARMS AND THE MAN,Burst out in anger:--“Why do you compel me
8087,ARMS AND THE MAN,"To break my silence, to make my sorrow vulgar"
8088,ARMS AND THE MAN,"With words for the world’s ear? What god, what mortal"
8089,ARMS AND THE MAN,Forced war upon Aeneas? Who advised him
8090,ARMS AND THE MAN,"To advance, an enemy, against Latinus?"
8091,ARMS AND THE MAN,_He came to Italy at the fates’ command_--
8092,ARMS AND THE MAN,So be it; but what about Cassandra’s ravings?
8093,ARMS AND THE MAN,Was I the one--I must have been--who told him
8094,ARMS AND THE MAN,"To leave the camp, to trust his life to the winds?"
8095,ARMS AND THE MAN,Was I the one who told him to make a boy
8096,ARMS AND THE MAN,The captain of the wall? Was it I who told him
8097,ARMS AND THE MAN,"To seek Etruscan allies, to hunt down people"
8098,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Who meant no harm? What god, what power of mine"
8099,ARMS AND THE MAN,Drove him to all his cheating? What has Juno
8100,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Or Iris, sent through the clouds, to do with this?"
8101,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Disgraceful and disgusting, that Italians"
8102,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Threaten the walls of Troy, new-born; that Turnus"
8103,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Stay in his native land, Turnus, descended"
8104,ARMS AND THE MAN,Himself from king and goddess. What about it?
8105,ARMS AND THE MAN,"What about this, that Trojans harry Latins"
8106,ARMS AND THE MAN,"With smoking brand and violence, set their yoke"
8107,ARMS AND THE MAN,"On fields not theirs, and carry off the plunder?"
8108,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Who let them know whose daughters to wed, or ravish?"
8109,ARMS AND THE MAN,Who told them to hold out the hand for peace
8110,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And arm the ships for war? Oh, you are able,"
8111,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Of course you are, to give them mist for a man,"
8112,ARMS AND THE MAN,To steal Aeneas from Greek hands; you are able
8113,ARMS AND THE MAN,"To turn their fleet to sea-nymphs, but if I"
8114,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Help the Rutulians even a very little,"
8115,ARMS AND THE MAN,Is that so monstrous? _Aeneas does not know it;
8116,ARMS AND THE MAN,He is far away._ Good. Let him still not know it;
8117,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Let him still be far away. You have Amathus,"
8118,ARMS AND THE MAN,High Paphus and Cythera; so why meddle
8119,ARMS AND THE MAN,With savage hearts and a city big with war?
8120,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And now, it seems, I am trying to pull over"
8121,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The wobbling walls of Troy! Really! Who was it,"
8122,ARMS AND THE MAN,"I, or somebody else, who flung the Trojans,"
8123,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Poor things, in the path of the Greeks? What was the reason"
8124,ARMS AND THE MAN,"For Europe and Asia to rise in arms, break treaties"
8125,ARMS AND THE MAN,Over a piece of stealing? Was it I
8126,ARMS AND THE MAN,Who shipped the adulterer Paris out to Sparta?
8127,ARMS AND THE MAN,Was it I who armed his lust? That was the time
8128,ARMS AND THE MAN,To have had some fear for those poor suffering Trojans.
8129,ARMS AND THE MAN,It is too late now. You rise to the occasion
8130,ARMS AND THE MAN,With unjust whining and shrill scolding nonsense.”
8131,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8132,ARMS AND THE MAN,So Juno argued: the company of heaven
8133,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Sided with one or the other, and the sound"
8134,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Was like the sound of winds caught in the forest,"
8135,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And sailors, listening, know that storms are coming."
8136,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And Jupiter all-powerful, the ruler"
8137,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Of all the world, began, and with his word"
8138,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The lofty palace of the gods grew quiet,"
8139,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The earth’s foundations trembled, and the winds"
8140,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Were still, and the loud ocean hushed the waters."
8141,ARMS AND THE MAN,“Take these my words to heart; be sure to heed them.
8142,ARMS AND THE MAN,It is forbidden Ausonians and Trojans
8143,ARMS AND THE MAN,"To join in concord; the arguments among you,"
8144,ARMS AND THE MAN,"It seems, will never end. Therefore I tell you,"
8145,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Whether a man is Trojan or Rutulian,"
8146,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Whatever luck he has to-day, whatever"
8147,ARMS AND THE MAN,"He hopes to have to-morrow, it does not matter."
8148,ARMS AND THE MAN,"I treat them both the same. It may be fate,"
8149,ARMS AND THE MAN,It may be Trojan foolishness and error
8150,ARMS AND THE MAN,That keeps the camp besieged: I do not judge.
8151,ARMS AND THE MAN,I hold Rutulians under obligation
8152,ARMS AND THE MAN,As well as Trojans. In every man’s beginning
8153,ARMS AND THE MAN,"His luck resides, for good or ill. I rule"
8154,ARMS AND THE MAN,All men alike. The fates will find the way.”
8155,ARMS AND THE MAN,And all Olympus trembled as he nodded
8156,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And swore by the waters of his Stygian brother,"
8157,ARMS AND THE MAN,The pitchy banks and the black seething torrent.
8158,ARMS AND THE MAN,There was no more talking. From his golden throne
8159,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Jove rose, with gods and goddesses attending"
8160,ARMS AND THE MAN,In deferential escort.
8161,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8162,ARMS AND THE MAN,In the meantime
8163,ARMS AND THE MAN,"At every gate Rutulians drive, determined"
8164,ARMS AND THE MAN,"To bring down men with steel, ring walls with flame."
8165,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The host of Troy is held inside, blockaded,"
8166,ARMS AND THE MAN,"With never a hope of flight. Wretched, they stand"
8167,ARMS AND THE MAN,"At the high towers, in vain; they are none too many"
8168,ARMS AND THE MAN,"To stretch the circle out. Imbrasus’ son,"
8169,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Asius, is there; Thymoetes; two young men,"
8170,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Assaracus’ sons; and Castor, and old Thymbris,"
8171,ARMS AND THE MAN,"In the front ranks; two brothers of Sarpedon,"
8172,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Clarus and Thaemon, with them; they came from Lycia."
8173,ARMS AND THE MAN,"One man, with every ounce of strength, is heaving"
8174,ARMS AND THE MAN,"To lift a giant boulder, half a mountain:"
8175,ARMS AND THE MAN,"That would be Acmon, Clytius’ son: Lyrnesus,"
8176,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Their home, produced enormous men--a brother,"
8177,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Mnestheus, too, was something of a giant."
8178,ARMS AND THE MAN,"So rocks are weapons of defense, and arrows,"
8179,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And darts, and balls of fire, and fighting men"
8180,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Are busy with them all, and the little Trojan,"
8181,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The pet of Venus, rightly so, was with them,"
8182,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Bare-headed, a handsome sight, a shining jewel"
8183,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Inlaid in yellow gold, or a medallion"
8184,ARMS AND THE MAN,Of ivory in terebinth or boxwood;
8185,ARMS AND THE MAN,"So shone Iulus, whose white neck and shoulders"
8186,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Seemed whiter where the blond hair fell, and the circlet"
8187,ARMS AND THE MAN,Of gold made bright the golden hair. Ismarus
8188,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Was there, an archer, whose shafts were dipped in poison,"
8189,ARMS AND THE MAN,A warrior far from his Maeonian homeland
8190,ARMS AND THE MAN,Where Pactolus floods the fields with yellow gold.
8191,ARMS AND THE MAN,And Mnestheus was there; he had beaten Turnus
8192,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The day before, and knew it, and was proud;"
8193,ARMS AND THE MAN,And Capys fought beside him: his name was given
8194,ARMS AND THE MAN,"To a city, later,--Capua, south of Rome."
8195,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8196,ARMS AND THE MAN,"So these men had been fighting, clash and conflict"
8197,ARMS AND THE MAN,"In the rough shock of warfare, as Aeneas,"
8198,ARMS AND THE MAN,"At midnight, cleaved the seas. He had left Evander,"
8199,ARMS AND THE MAN,"He had found the Tuscan camp, he had told the king"
8200,ARMS AND THE MAN,"His name, his race, his need, what help he brought him,"
8201,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Told Tarchon of Mezentius, of the spirit"
8202,ARMS AND THE MAN,Of violence in Turnus; had given warning
8203,ARMS AND THE MAN,"That, always, men need help; had made appeal,"
8204,ARMS AND THE MAN,Which Tarchon promptly answered: so the people
8205,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Were free from fate’s injunction, free for war,"
8206,ARMS AND THE MAN,Having a foreign leader. Aeneas’ ship
8207,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Headed the column, her figure-head a mountain"
8208,ARMS AND THE MAN,"With lions at the base, familiar Ida,"
8209,ARMS AND THE MAN,Dear to the Trojan exiles. And Aeneas
8210,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Sailed on toward war and all those changing fortunes,"
8211,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And Pallas stayed beside him, asking questions:"
8212,ARMS AND THE MAN,What stars were those? which was the one to guide them
8213,ARMS AND THE MAN,Through the dark night? what fortunes had he suffered
8214,ARMS AND THE MAN,On land and sea?
8215,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8216,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Fling wide the gates, O Muses,"
8217,ARMS AND THE MAN,Inspire the song: what force rides with Aeneas
8218,ARMS AND THE MAN,"From Tuscan shores, what warships sail the ocean?"
8219,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8220,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Massicus leads the way in the bronze _Tiger_,"
8221,ARMS AND THE MAN,"A thousand men on board; they have come from Clusium,"
8222,ARMS AND THE MAN,"From Cosae’s city, archers all, with quivers"
8223,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Light on their shoulders, and their bows are deadly."
8224,ARMS AND THE MAN,With them is glowering Abas; a gold Apollo
8225,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Gleams on his bowsprit, and the vessel blazes"
8226,ARMS AND THE MAN,"With men in armor; the little island Ilva,"
8227,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Rich in her mines, had sent them, thrice a hundred,"
8228,ARMS AND THE MAN,And Populonia furnished twice as many.
8229,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Third comes Asilas, priest and augur, learnèd"
8230,ARMS AND THE MAN,"In all the signs, diviner of stars and lightning,"
8231,ARMS AND THE MAN,Of birds and entrails; he brings a thousand spearmen
8232,ARMS AND THE MAN,"From Pisa, on Etruscan soil. And Astur"
8233,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Follows, a handsome horseman, with three hundred"
8234,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Stalwarts from Caere, Minio, and Pyrgi,"
8235,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Proud, confident men, with arms of many colors."
8236,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And Cinyras is there, the bravest leader"
8237,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Of all Ligurian captains, and Cupavo,"
8238,ARMS AND THE MAN,With none too many followers; his crest
8239,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Is white swan-plumage, a token of his father,"
8240,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Who, so they say, loved Phaethon, and grieved"
8241,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Over his fall from heaven, and made music"
8242,ARMS AND THE MAN,"To heal his sorrow, under the poplar trees"
8243,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Phaethon’s sisters haunted, and so, singing,"
8244,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Became a bird, all white and soft, and vanished"
8245,ARMS AND THE MAN,"From earth, and was a crying voice in heaven,"
8246,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Cygnus, the swan. And now his son Cupavo"
8247,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Comes to the wars, driving his ship, the _Centaur_,"
8248,ARMS AND THE MAN,Which towers high as a cliff; the long keel furrows
8249,ARMS AND THE MAN,A wide wake over the sea.
8250,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8251,ARMS AND THE MAN,And Ocnus summons
8252,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Men from his native shores, Ocnus, the son"
8253,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Of a Tuscan river and a woman, Manto,"
8254,ARMS AND THE MAN,Gifted in prophecy; her name was given
8255,ARMS AND THE MAN,"To Mantua, rich in ancestors, one city,"
8256,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Three races, each one master of four peoples,"
8257,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And Mantua the queen of all, her power"
8258,ARMS AND THE MAN,Secure in Tuscan strength. From here Mezentius
8259,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Rouses five hundred men in arms against him,"
8260,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And Mincius, Benacus’ son, crowned with grey rushes"
8261,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Brings them down to the sea. On comes Aulestes,"
8262,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Whose _Triton_ wallows heavily in the waters,"
8263,ARMS AND THE MAN,"With a hundred oars lashing the waves to foam,"
8264,ARMS AND THE MAN,And the blue waters tremble at the sea-god
8265,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Riding the prow, conch at his lips, a figure"
8266,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Shaped like a shaggy man, as far as the belly,"
8267,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And then a fish or serpent, a great sea-monster,"
8268,ARMS AND THE MAN,Under whose weight the water sucks and gurgles.
8269,ARMS AND THE MAN,"So the bronze vessels come, thirty good ships"
8270,ARMS AND THE MAN,"For the help of Troy, and men, and chosen leaders"
8271,ARMS AND THE MAN,Over the salt sea plains.
8272,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8273,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And day had gone,"
8274,ARMS AND THE MAN,And the dear moon in her night-wandering chariot
8275,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Was halfway up the sky; Aeneas, restless,"
8276,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Tended the sails and rudder, holding the course,"
8277,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And a band of his own company came to meet him,"
8278,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Those goddesses, whom Cybele had ordered"
8279,ARMS AND THE MAN,"To rule the seas that once they sailed. They knew him,"
8280,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Their king, far off, circled his ships in greeting,"
8281,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And Cymodocea, of them all most gifted"
8282,ARMS AND THE MAN,"In ways of speech, clung to the stern; one hand"
8283,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Lifted her out of the water, and the other"
8284,ARMS AND THE MAN,Kept plying under the waves. She hailed Aeneas:--
8285,ARMS AND THE MAN,"“Are you on watch, son of the gods? Be watchful,"
8286,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Crowd on full sail! We are the pines of Ida,"
8287,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Born from that sacred mountain. Nymphs of the sea,"
8288,ARMS AND THE MAN,We used to be your fleet. But treacherous Turnus
8289,ARMS AND THE MAN,Drove us with fire and sword; against our will
8290,ARMS AND THE MAN,"We broke our bonds to you, and now we seek you"
8291,ARMS AND THE MAN,Over the deep. The mother of the gods
8292,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Took pity on us, and made us goddesses,"
8293,ARMS AND THE MAN,Immortal under the waters. We have bad news; your son
8294,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Is under siege; walls hold him in, and trenches,"
8295,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And the air is filled with darts, and the wild Latins"
8296,ARMS AND THE MAN,Bristle in war. The cavalry of Pallas
8297,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And the brave Etruscan allies, minding orders,"
8298,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Hold their appointed station. Turnus knows it,"
8299,ARMS AND THE MAN,Turnus is certain to send opposing squadrons
8300,ARMS AND THE MAN,"To keep them from the camp. Hurry, then, hurry,"
8301,ARMS AND THE MAN,Get the men armed by daylight; raise the shield
8302,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Given by Vulcan, the invincible armor,"
8303,ARMS AND THE MAN,Bright with its ring of gold. To-morrow morning
8304,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Shall see, unless I speak in foolish error,"
8305,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Great heaps of slain Rutulians.” She finished speaking,"
8306,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And as she left the ship, her right hand gave it"
8307,ARMS AND THE MAN,"An expert shove, and it sped over the water"
8308,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Swifter than javelin or flying arrow,"
8309,ARMS AND THE MAN,And the other vessels quickened pace. Aeneas
8310,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Marvelled, amazed, and the portent cheered his spirit,"
8311,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And he looked up to the vault of heaven, praying:--"
8312,ARMS AND THE MAN,"“Dear mother of the gods, Idean queen,"
8313,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Lover of tower-crowned cities, and the lions"
8314,ARMS AND THE MAN,"That draw the chariot, be my leader now"
8315,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Before the fight begins, affirm the omen,"
8316,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Favor the Trojans, goddess, with your blessing.”"
8317,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And as he spoke, new day broke over the ocean"
8318,ARMS AND THE MAN,"In a great blaze of light, and the darkness vanished."
8319,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8320,ARMS AND THE MAN,It was time for the last warnings to his comrades:
8321,ARMS AND THE MAN,"_Follow the signals, nerve the spirit for battle,"
8322,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Make every preparation!_ And he stood there,"
8323,ARMS AND THE MAN,"High on the stern, seeing, before his eyes,"
8324,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The Trojans and his camp, and he lifted high"
8325,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The blazing shield, and the Trojans raised a clamor"
8326,ARMS AND THE MAN,"To the high stars; new hope inflamed their anger,"
8327,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And the darts flew, as cranes come back to Strymon"
8328,ARMS AND THE MAN,Noisy before the southern gales. But Turnus
8329,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And the Rutulian leaders were dumbfounded,--"
8330,ARMS AND THE MAN,What miracle was this?--looked back and saw
8331,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The sterns lined up to the shore, the whole great ocean"
8332,ARMS AND THE MAN,"One mass of moving ships. The helmet burned,"
8333,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The crest streamed fire, the golden boss of the shield"
8334,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Poured golden radiance: even so, at night-time"
8335,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The comets burn blood-red, or Sirius’ fire,"
8336,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Portent of drought and pestilence to mortals,"
8337,ARMS AND THE MAN,Saddens the sky with evil glare.
8338,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8339,ARMS AND THE MAN,But Turnus
8340,ARMS AND THE MAN,Never lost confidence or nerve; he would beat them
8341,ARMS AND THE MAN,"There at the shore, he knew, and stop the landing."
8342,ARMS AND THE MAN,"“Men, here is what you always prayed for; do it!"
8343,ARMS AND THE MAN,Break through with sword-arm! Mars is in your hands.
8344,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Remember, every man, his wife, his household,"
8345,ARMS AND THE MAN,His fathers’ noble glories. On to meet them
8346,ARMS AND THE MAN,"At the water’s edge: they tremble there, they stagger,"
8347,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And luck helps men who dare.” He chose his captains,"
8348,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Picked men for this attack, and left to others"
8349,ARMS AND THE MAN,The duty of the siege.
8350,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8351,ARMS AND THE MAN,Meanwhile Aeneas
8352,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Landed his comrades, down from the tall ships,"
8353,ARMS AND THE MAN,Over the gangways. Many leapt boldly down
8354,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Catching the ebb of the sea, and others vaulted"
8355,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Over the oar-blades. Tarchon, watching the shore-line,"
8356,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Saw where the shallow water was hardly breathing,"
8357,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Where never a breaker roared, where the smooth ocean"
8358,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Came gliding slowly in, and he turned his prow,"
8359,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Calling on comrades:--“Now is the time, bend to it,"
8360,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Lean on the oars, pick up the ships and lift them!"
8361,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Let the beaks split this hostile land, and keels"
8362,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Plough a deep furrow: what does a shipwreck matter,"
8363,ARMS AND THE MAN,So we take hold of land?” And as he urged them
8364,ARMS AND THE MAN,"They rose to the oars, they drove the foaming ships"
8365,ARMS AND THE MAN,"To the dry Latin fields, and every vessel"
8366,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Came in, unhurt, except for one. For Tarchon"
8367,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Ran up on a ledge of rock and hung there, doubtful,"
8368,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Tilting now back, now forward, until he broke"
8369,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Above the weary wave, and the timbers weakened,"
8370,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Gave way, and the men were flung in the midst of ocean,"
8371,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Among the broken oars and the floating cross-beams,"
8372,ARMS AND THE MAN,And the drag of the undertow.
8373,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8374,ARMS AND THE MAN,No lazy dawdling
8375,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Held Turnus back; he hurled his lines against them,"
8376,ARMS AND THE MAN,"He stopped them at the shore. Aeneas charged,"
8377,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Aeneas was the first invader, Aeneas"
8378,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Struck down the Latin countrymen, killed Theron,"
8379,ARMS AND THE MAN,The biggest of them all. That was an omen;
8380,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Theron had taken extra pains to meet him,"
8381,ARMS AND THE MAN,But the sword went through his mail and through his tunic
8382,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And pierced his side and drank his blood. Next, Lichas"
8383,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Was slain, Apollo’s devotee, at birth"
8384,ARMS AND THE MAN,Cut from the womb of his dead mother: the child
8385,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Escaped the steel, but not the man. Two others,"
8386,ARMS AND THE MAN,"One of them tough, one huge, Cisseus, Gyas,"
8387,ARMS AND THE MAN,Went down before Aeneas. They were fighting
8388,ARMS AND THE MAN,"With clubs, as Hercules used to, and much good"
8389,ARMS AND THE MAN,"It did them, though their father was Melampus"
8390,ARMS AND THE MAN,Who had been with Hercules through many labors.
8391,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Then there was Pharus, who had his mouth wide open,"
8392,ARMS AND THE MAN,"For boast or taunt, and got a javelin in it,"
8393,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Flung by Aeneas’ hand. Cydon loved Clytius,"
8394,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And followed him everywhere, his golden darling,"
8395,ARMS AND THE MAN,And would have had a lesson in forgetting
8396,ARMS AND THE MAN,"All his beloved young men, falling a victim"
8397,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Under Aeneas’ hand, but his seven brothers,"
8398,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The sons of Phorcus, hurried to his rescue."
8399,ARMS AND THE MAN,Each one let fly a dart: helmet and shield
8400,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Turned them aside, or they only grazed the body"
8401,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Through Venus’ help. “Achates,” cried Aeneas,"
8402,ARMS AND THE MAN,“Bring up more weapons! Any I ever landed
8403,ARMS AND THE MAN,"In bodies of the Greeks, on the plains of Ilium,"
8404,ARMS AND THE MAN,Will never miss Rutulians here.” He snatched
8405,ARMS AND THE MAN,"A great spear up, and flung it; it went flying"
8406,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Through Maeon’s shield of bronze; it rent the breastplate,"
8407,ARMS AND THE MAN,"It tore the breast, went through, and struck Alcanor"
8408,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Through the right arm around his falling brother,"
8409,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And pierced the arm, and kept its bloody journey"
8410,ARMS AND THE MAN,While the dead arm dangled from shoulder-sinew.
8411,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Numitor ripped the spear from his brother’s body,"
8412,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Aimed at Aeneas, missed, but grazed Achates."
8413,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8414,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Clausus from Cures, proud of his young body,"
8415,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Let fly, far off, a javelin, which caught Dryops"
8416,ARMS AND THE MAN,Under the chin and pierced the throat and robbed him
8417,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Of voice--he tried to speak--and life together,"
8418,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And Dryops’ forehead hit the ground, and blood"
8419,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Poured thick from mouth and wound. Three Thracians fell,"
8420,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Sons of the race of Boreas, and three others,"
8421,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Ismarians, sons of Idas, killed by Clausus."
8422,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Halaesus came to his side, and Neptune’s son,"
8423,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Messapus, joined them, that famous tamer of horses."
8424,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Here, there, on every side, the struggle rages:"
8425,ARMS AND THE MAN,The cry is _Drive them back!_ Here is the beach-head
8426,ARMS AND THE MAN,"For gain or loss. As warring winds in heaven,"
8427,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Rage at each other through that wide dominion,"
8428,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Equal in will and violence, the battle"
8429,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Doubtful and long, and nothing yields, not wind,"
8430,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Not cloud, not sea, in that eternal deadlock,"
8431,ARMS AND THE MAN,"So Troy meets Latium in the shock of fighting,"
8432,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Foot tramples foot, man grapples man."
8433,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8434,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And inland,"
8435,ARMS AND THE MAN,"On ground where a raging stream had sent stones rolling,"
8436,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And torn the bushes from the banks, the horsemen"
8437,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Had to be infantry, for the rough ground"
8438,ARMS AND THE MAN,Forbade the use of chariots. Their nerve
8439,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Was at low ebb; they fled. And Pallas saw them,"
8440,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And being their one hope, with scorn and prayer"
8441,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Rallied their courage:--“Where do you flee, Arcadians?"
8442,ARMS AND THE MAN,"By your own brave deeds I beg you, by your king,"
8443,ARMS AND THE MAN,"By the old wars won in Evander’s name,"
8444,ARMS AND THE MAN,"By my own hopes to match my father’s praise,"
8445,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Trust not to flight. The sword must cut the way,"
8446,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And where that mass of men comes thickest toward us,"
8447,ARMS AND THE MAN,"That way we go, with Pallas as your leader"
8448,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Our country calls; no gods pursue us: men,"
8449,ARMS AND THE MAN,"We are being chased by men, with no more hands,"
8450,ARMS AND THE MAN,With no more lives than we have. Ocean blocks us
8451,ARMS AND THE MAN,With his great dam; earth offers us no haven:
8452,ARMS AND THE MAN,Are we bound for Troy or the sea?” And he dashed in
8453,ARMS AND THE MAN,Where the enemy was thickest. Lagus came
8454,ARMS AND THE MAN,To meet him; fate was far from kind to Lagus.
8455,ARMS AND THE MAN,He was trying to lift a stone when Pallas hit him
8456,ARMS AND THE MAN,And the javelin stuck in the spine between the ribs
8457,ARMS AND THE MAN,Till Pallas pulled it loose again. Then Hisbo
8458,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Hoped to surprise him and failed; he came in rushing,"
8459,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Reckless and angry over the death of Lagus,"
8460,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And Pallas was ready for him, and drove the sword"
8461,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Deep in the swollen lung. He went for Sthenius,"
8462,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Then Anchemolus, of Rhoetus’ ancient line,"
8463,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The consort of his stepmother in incest,"
8464,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And then he saw twin brothers, sons of Daucus,"
8465,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Named Thymber and Larides, whom their kinsmen"
8466,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Could never tell apart, and their own parents"
8467,ARMS AND THE MAN,Made fond mistakes about them. But Pallas made
8468,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Them different, once for all; Evander’s sword"
8469,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Cut off the head of Thymber; Larides’ hand,"
8470,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Severed, looked blindly for its arm, the fingers"
8471,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Closed, quivering and dying, on the sword."
8472,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8473,ARMS AND THE MAN,So the Arcadians rallied; his example
8474,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Armed them with shame and rage. Tyres and Teuthras,"
8475,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Arcadian brothers, started after Rhoeteus,"
8476,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Who fled, and that saved Ilus’ life, for Pallas"
8477,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Had flung a spear at Ilus, but Rhoeteus, driving"
8478,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Into its path, received it, rolled from the chariot,"
8479,ARMS AND THE MAN,And his heels kicked the ground in death’s convulsion.
8480,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And as in summer, when a shepherd kindles"
8481,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Fire here and there among the brush or forest,"
8482,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And waits for wind, and hears it rise, and swiftly"
8483,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The many fires are one great blaze, and Vulcan"
8484,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Takes charge of all the field, above the battle"
8485,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Watching victorious, so Pallas’ comrades"
8486,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Swept in from all directions, bright and burning,"
8487,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Toward him, their focus and centre. And Halaesus"
8488,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Came on to meet them, pulling himself together,"
8489,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Setting himself for battle. He killed Ladon,"
8490,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Pheres, Demodocus: Strymonius threatened"
8491,ARMS AND THE MAN,"His throat with the gleaming sword, and for his trouble"
8492,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Got his right hand cut off, and then Halaesus"
8493,ARMS AND THE MAN,Bashed Thoas’ head in with a rock and scrambled
8494,ARMS AND THE MAN,"His skull-bones, blood and brains. Halaesus’ father"
8495,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Knew his son’s destiny and tried to spare him,"
8496,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Hiding him in the woodlands, but grew old"
8497,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And could not watch forever, and when his eyes"
8498,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Were blind in death, the fates reached out, Halaesus"
8499,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Could not avoid his doom. Pallas attacked him,"
8500,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Praying before he flung the spear:--“O Tiber,"
8501,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Grant to the steel I poise and hurl good fortune,"
8502,ARMS AND THE MAN,A pathway through the breast of tough Halaesus:
8503,ARMS AND THE MAN,Your oak will hold his arms and spoil as trophy.”
8504,ARMS AND THE MAN,And Tiber heard the prayer; Halaesus’ luck
8505,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Ran out, he had left himself exposed, to cover"
8506,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Imaon with his shield, and the bare breast"
8507,ARMS AND THE MAN,Took the Arcadian lance.
8508,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8509,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Lausus, unfrightened,"
8510,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Himself no little portion of war, fought on,"
8511,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Kept up the courage of his men, found Abas"
8512,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And cut him down; when Abas fell, a cluster"
8513,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Of stubborn fight was broken. The young men die,"
8514,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Arcadians, Etruscans, Trojan fighters"
8515,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Who had survived Greek wounds; they come to grips,"
8516,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Both armies, equal in leadership and valor;"
8517,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Lines become columns, columns lines: all thickens"
8518,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Into confusion, a press too close for fighting."
8519,ARMS AND THE MAN,"On one side Pallas thrusts and strains, and Lausus"
8520,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Struggles to meet him, two young heroes, equal,"
8521,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Or nearly so, in years, in worth, in courage,"
8522,ARMS AND THE MAN,In handsome manliness; and both denied
8523,ARMS AND THE MAN,Return to fatherland; and each forbidden
8524,ARMS AND THE MAN,To meet the other; and both assured of finding
8525,ARMS AND THE MAN,Their fate where a greater enemy is waiting.
8526,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8527,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Meanwhile the sister of Turnus brought him warning,"
8528,ARMS AND THE MAN,"_Lausus needs aid!_ So, with his car, he drove"
8529,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Swift through the ranks. “Break off, and give me room,”"
8530,ARMS AND THE MAN,"He cried, “Room for my duel. I am bound"
8531,ARMS AND THE MAN,"To battle Pallas; Pallas is my prize,"
8532,ARMS AND THE MAN,My prize alone. I only wish his father
8533,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Were here to watch!” Obedient, his comrades"
8534,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Gave place, and as they yielded, Pallas stood"
8535,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Astonished at this arrogance, this giant:"
8536,ARMS AND THE MAN,"He took the whole scene in, undaunted, proud,"
8537,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Fierce, high in spirit, with a ready answer"
8538,ARMS AND THE MAN,For Turnus’ taunting:--“Either I win my praise
8539,ARMS AND THE MAN,"For kingly spoils or glorious death, and soon:"
8540,ARMS AND THE MAN,My father can face either: spare the threats!”
8541,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And he moved forward, and the blood ran chill"
8542,ARMS AND THE MAN,In all Arcadian hearts. Down from his car
8543,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Jumps Turnus; he comes nearer, like a lion"
8544,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Who sees far-off a bull, intent on battle,"
8545,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And stalks, and rushes; even so came Turnus,"
8546,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Came within spear-throw; Pallas, watching, knew it,"
8547,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Took a step forward, and, that chance might favor"
8548,ARMS AND THE MAN,"However uneven his strength, prayed to the heavens:--"
8549,ARMS AND THE MAN,“If ever my father entertained a stranger
8550,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Who proved a god, and gave him food and greeting,"
8551,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Aid me, O Hercules! Let Turnus see me"
8552,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Taking the bloody armor from his body,"
8553,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And his dying eyes behold me, Pallas, victor.”"
8554,ARMS AND THE MAN,The young prayer touched the god: his grief was stifled
8555,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Deep in his heart, and tears were vain; his father"
8556,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Spoke to him kindly:--“Every man, my son,"
8557,ARMS AND THE MAN,Has his appointed time; life’s day is short
8558,ARMS AND THE MAN,"For all men; they can never win it back,"
8559,ARMS AND THE MAN,But to extend it further by noble deeds
8560,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Is the task set for valor. Even my son,"
8561,ARMS AND THE MAN,"My own, and sons of other gods have fallen"
8562,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Under Troy’s lofty walls. Sarpedon, Turnus,"
8563,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Fate calls alike: the years for each are measured,"
8564,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The goal in sight.” Jupiter, having spoken,"
8565,ARMS AND THE MAN,Shifted his eyes from the Rutulian landscape.
8566,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8567,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And Pallas flung the spear, full force, and drew"
8568,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The flashing blade; the shaft sped on, it struck"
8569,ARMS AND THE MAN,Where mail and shoulder met; piercing the shield
8570,ARMS AND THE MAN,It grazed the side of Turnus. And he poised
8571,ARMS AND THE MAN,"His long oak shaft with the sharp iron, hurled it,"
8572,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And a taunt went with the toss:--“Which pierces deeper,"
8573,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Your spear or mine?” So, through the plates of iron,"
8574,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The plates of bronze, the overlapping leather,"
8575,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Through the shield’s center drives the quivering point,"
8576,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Through stubborn mail, through the great breast. In vain"
8577,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Pallas pulls out the dart, warm from the wound."
8578,ARMS AND THE MAN,"His blood, his life, come with it, and he falls"
8579,ARMS AND THE MAN,Doubled upon his wound; the armor clangs
8580,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Over his body; he strikes the hostile earth,"
8581,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Dying, with bloody mouth. Above him Turnus,"
8582,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Rejoicing, cries:--“Arcadians, take notice,"
8583,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And let Evander know, I am sending back"
8584,ARMS AND THE MAN,Pallas as he deserved. Whatever honor
8585,ARMS AND THE MAN,"A tomb affords, whatever comfort lies"
8586,ARMS AND THE MAN,"In burial, that much I grant, and freely:"
8587,ARMS AND THE MAN,"A costly welcome, Evander’s to Aeneas!”"
8588,ARMS AND THE MAN,"His left foot on the body, he ripped loose"
8589,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The belt’s great weight, with the story of a murder"
8590,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Carved in its metal, the young men foully murdered"
8591,ARMS AND THE MAN,"On the bridal night, the chamber drenched in blood,"
8592,ARMS AND THE MAN,"As Clonus, son of Eurytus, engraved it."
8593,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And Turnus gloried in the spoil, exulting--"
8594,ARMS AND THE MAN,"O ignorant mortal mind, which never knows"
8595,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Of fate or doom ahead, or how, in fortune,"
8596,ARMS AND THE MAN,To keep in decent bounds! A time is coming
8597,ARMS AND THE MAN,"When Turnus would pay dearly, could he purchase"
8598,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Pallas unharmed again, would view with loathing"
8599,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Those spoils, that day. But now, with tears and weeping,"
8600,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Comrades lift Pallas to the shield and take him,"
8601,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Great sorrow and great glory, to his father."
8602,ARMS AND THE MAN,"One day of war, one day of death, but victims,"
8603,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And many, for Rutulians to remember."
8604,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8605,ARMS AND THE MAN,"No rumor, but a runner from the battle"
8606,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Comes to Aeneas, of his men endangered,"
8607,ARMS AND THE MAN,"At the edge of death: they are giving way, the Trojans,"
8608,ARMS AND THE MAN,There is not much time. Aeneas draws the sword;
8609,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Aeneas, burning, cuts a pathway through"
8610,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The nearest lines; it is Turnus he is seeking,"
8611,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Turnus the arrogant, slaughter fresh upon him."
8612,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Aeneas, all imagination, sees"
8613,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Pallas, Evander, and the friendly tables"
8614,ARMS AND THE MAN,"To which he came, a stranger; hears the pledge"
8615,ARMS AND THE MAN,Given and taken. For another pledge
8616,ARMS AND THE MAN,"He seizes four young men, the sons of Sulmo,"
8617,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And four whom Ufens fathered; he takes them, living,"
8618,ARMS AND THE MAN,"For later sacrifice, to dye with blood"
8619,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The funeral pyre of Pallas. From afar,"
8620,ARMS AND THE MAN,"He aimed his spear at Magus, but that warrior"
8621,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Ducked under it cleverly, and the shaft flew over,"
8622,ARMS AND THE MAN,And Magus was a suppliant at his knees:--
8623,ARMS AND THE MAN,"“I beg you, by the shades of great Anchises,"
8624,ARMS AND THE MAN,"By all the hope you have of young Iulus,"
8625,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Spare me, a father and a son, for son"
8626,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And father. I have property and treasure,"
8627,ARMS AND THE MAN,"A lofty house, talents of gold and silver"
8628,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Buried in safety, crude and minted metal."
8629,ARMS AND THE MAN,One life like mine is nothing to the Trojans:
8630,ARMS AND THE MAN,"What difference will it make?” “Save for your sons,”"
8631,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Aeneas answered, “all that gold and silver."
8632,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Turnus broke off all bargain-talk, the killer,"
8633,ARMS AND THE MAN,When Pallas fell. The shades of great Anchises
8634,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Know this, my growing son, Iulus, knows it.”"
8635,ARMS AND THE MAN,His left hand grasped the helmet; Magus felt
8636,ARMS AND THE MAN,"His head drawn back, he felt throat muscles tighten,"
8637,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And, as he pleaded still, he felt the sword"
8638,ARMS AND THE MAN,Deep driven to the hilt.
8639,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8640,ARMS AND THE MAN,A son of Haemon
8641,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Was standing not far off, the holy fillets"
8642,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Around his temples, gleaming in the robes"
8643,ARMS AND THE MAN,"He wore as priest of Phoebus and Diana,"
8644,ARMS AND THE MAN,Bright in his glittering arms. He fled Aeneas
8645,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Across the field, in vain escape, and stumbled,"
8646,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And the Trojan hero, standing over his body,"
8647,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Struck down, and killed, and gave him a cloak of darkness,"
8648,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And Serestus took his armor, spoil for Mars."
8649,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8650,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Caeculus, born of Vulcan’s race, and Umbro,"
8651,ARMS AND THE MAN,"From Marsian mountains, rallied the ranks. Aeneas"
8652,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Came storming toward them, hot from wounding Anxur,"
8653,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Who had been boasting loud, hoping that words"
8654,ARMS AND THE MAN,Would make him more aggressive: there was no limit
8655,ARMS AND THE MAN,"To promises he made himself, long years,"
8656,ARMS AND THE MAN,"A ripe old age--if so, he would be a cripple,"
8657,ARMS AND THE MAN,A man with no left hand: Aeneas lopped it
8658,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Off at the wrist, and the shield’s round circle with it."
8659,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Tarquitus, son of Dryope and Faunus,"
8660,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Proud in his gleaming arms, stood up against him"
8661,ARMS AND THE MAN,Briefly; the spear drove through the shield’s huge weight
8662,ARMS AND THE MAN,Nailing it to the breastplate; all in vain
8663,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Tarquitus pleaded, stammering and choking."
8664,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Aeneas gave his head a shove; the body,"
8665,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Still warm, turned halfway over under his foot."
8666,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Dying, Tarquitus heard:--“Lie there, and scare me,"
8667,ARMS AND THE MAN,Terrible warrior! No loving mother
8668,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Will ever bury your bones, no father build"
8669,ARMS AND THE MAN,A sepulchre above them. The birds of prey
8670,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Will take you, or the waters of the flood,"
8671,ARMS AND THE MAN,And greedy fishes nibble your wounds and mouth them.”
8672,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Four more were slaughtered, Lucas and Antaeus,"
8673,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Conspicuous in Turnus’ ranks, and Numa,"
8674,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And sun-burnt Camers, son of noble Volcens,"
8675,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Richest in land of all Ausonians, ruler"
8676,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Over Amyclae, the city known for silence."
8677,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Men say there was a giant once, Aegaeon,"
8678,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Who had a hundred arms, and fifty mouths"
8679,ARMS AND THE MAN,"From each of which came fire, and fifty swords"
8680,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And fifty shields, and rattled them together,"
8681,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Defying Heaven’s thunderbolts and lightning,--"
8682,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Such was Aeneas now, a victor raging"
8683,ARMS AND THE MAN,"All up and down the field, with one sword only"
8684,ARMS AND THE MAN,But that one hot and red. He saw Niphaeus
8685,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Driving his four swift horses, and went toward them"
8686,ARMS AND THE MAN,"With terrible strides and cursing, and they bolted,"
8687,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Shook off the driver, dragged the car, a ruin,"
8688,ARMS AND THE MAN,Down to the shore of the sea. And then two brothers
8689,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Bring their white chariot on, Lucagus, Liger,"
8690,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Of whom Lucagus whirls the sword in fighting,"
8691,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And Liger plies the reins; they burn with fury,"
8692,ARMS AND THE MAN,"More than Aeneas can stand: he rushes, monstrous,"
8693,ARMS AND THE MAN,A giant with a spear. And Liger taunts him:--
8694,ARMS AND THE MAN,"“Whoa! This is not Achilles’ car, these fields"
8695,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Not Troy, these horses Diomedes’."
8696,ARMS AND THE MAN,"You will get it now, the end of life and battle,"
8697,ARMS AND THE MAN,Here on this ground.” Poor crazy-talking Liger!
8698,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Aeneas wastes no words; his lance comes flying,"
8699,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And while Lucagus, leaning over the chariot,"
8700,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Makes of his sword a whip, his left foot forward,"
8701,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Setting himself for action, the point comes through"
8702,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The low rim of his shield, drives on, and pierces"
8703,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The groin on the left side. Lucagus topples,"
8704,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Writhes on the ground, and dies; and then Aeneas"
8705,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Has words for him, and bitter ones:--“Lucagus,"
8706,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Your horses have not run away; they are brave,"
8707,ARMS AND THE MAN,"They are no traitors, shying at a shadow."
8708,ARMS AND THE MAN,"You are the one, it seems, the cheap deserter,"
8709,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Who jump the wheels, leave the poor beasts forsaken.”"
8710,ARMS AND THE MAN,"He pulls the horses up; and down comes Liger,"
8711,ARMS AND THE MAN,"His luck all gone, his hands outstretched for mercy:--"
8712,ARMS AND THE MAN,"“O Trojan hero, son of mighty parents,"
8713,ARMS AND THE MAN,"For their remembrance, spare my life: Oh, hear me--”"
8714,ARMS AND THE MAN,And there was more he would have said. Aeneas
8715,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Broke in:--“Liger, that’s not the way you sounded"
8716,ARMS AND THE MAN,A little while ago. What? Should a brother
8717,ARMS AND THE MAN,Leave brother in the battle? Never. Die!”
8718,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And the sword went its deadly way, exposing"
8719,ARMS AND THE MAN,The spirit’s hiding-place. Such was the carnage
8720,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Dealt by Aeneas over the plain, a whirlwind,"
8721,ARMS AND THE MAN,A flood of black destruction. And at the city
8722,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Ascanius and the warriors broke the siege,"
8723,ARMS AND THE MAN,Came from the threatened camp.
8724,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8725,ARMS AND THE MAN,And high in heaven
8726,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Jupiter spoke to Juno:--“Sister of mine,"
8727,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And dearest wife, it is, as you were thinking--"
8728,ARMS AND THE MAN,"You are not wrong--Venus, who helps the Trojans,"
8729,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Instead of their own right hands, war-quick, or spirit"
8730,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Aggressive in attack, enduring in danger.”"
8731,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And Juno made meek answer:--“Why, dear husband,"
8732,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Trouble me further? I am sick at heart,"
8733,ARMS AND THE MAN,I fear your sad commandments. If I only
8734,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Had what I used to have, compelling love,"
8735,ARMS AND THE MAN,"You would not, all-powerful king, refuse my pleading:"
8736,ARMS AND THE MAN,"You would let me rescue Turnus from the battle,"
8737,ARMS AND THE MAN,Restore him safely to his father Daunus.
8738,ARMS AND THE MAN,"That would have been my prayer; but let him die,"
8739,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Let innocent blood be forfeit to the Trojans,"
8740,ARMS AND THE MAN,"No matter that his lineage is lofty,"
8741,ARMS AND THE MAN,"His origin from our stock; no matter, either,"
8742,ARMS AND THE MAN,The generous offerings he has made your altars.”
8743,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8744,ARMS AND THE MAN,The king of high Olympus thus made answer:--
8745,ARMS AND THE MAN,“If it is only respite and reprieve
8746,ARMS AND THE MAN,"You ask for this doomed youth, delay, postponement,"
8747,ARMS AND THE MAN,"If that is all, and you realize I know it,"
8748,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Take Turnus off by flight, snatch him from danger."
8749,ARMS AND THE MAN,"That much you are permitted. But if, beneath the prayer,"
8750,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Some deeper hope lies hidden, if you are thinking"
8751,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The war might change entirely, then you nourish"
8752,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The silliest kind of dreaming.” Juno, weeping,"
8753,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Replied:--“But what if, in your heart, you granted"
8754,ARMS AND THE MAN,The gift your speech refuses? What if Turnus
8755,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Might still live on? No; heavy doom awaits him,"
8756,ARMS AND THE MAN,Or else I am borne along in grievous error.
8757,ARMS AND THE MAN,"I wish my fear were false and I deluded,"
8758,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And that the god, who has all power, would use it"
8759,ARMS AND THE MAN,"To change things for the better.” And, having spoken,"
8760,ARMS AND THE MAN,"She veiled herself with cloud, came down from heaven,"
8761,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Driving a storm before her, and sought Laurentum,"
8762,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The Trojan line, the Latin camp, and fashioned"
8763,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Out of a cloud, a hollow man, a figure"
8764,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Thin, weak, and curious to see, a phantom,"
8765,ARMS AND THE MAN,"A false Aeneas, dressed in Trojan armor,"
8766,ARMS AND THE MAN,"A mimic shield and crest, with unreal language,"
8767,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Voice without purpose, the image of a stride,"
8768,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Like the vain forms that flit when death is over,"
8769,ARMS AND THE MAN,Like dreams that mock the drugged and drowsy senses.
8770,ARMS AND THE MAN,With arrogant joy this ghost went out parading
8771,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Before the warriors’ ranks, brandishing weapons,"
8772,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Taunting and daring Turnus, who came on,"
8773,ARMS AND THE MAN,Hurled from afar the whirring spear; the phantom
8774,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Turned and made off, and Turnus, in confusion,"
8775,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Nourished an empty hope: Aeneas, he thought,"
8776,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Had turned away, was gone. “What now, Aeneas?"
8777,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Where do you flee? Do not desert the bride,"
8778,ARMS AND THE MAN,The marriage chamber!” And he drew the sword
8779,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Glittering as he challenged, and did not notice"
8780,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The winds sweep off his happiness. Near by,"
8781,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Moored to a shelf of rock, a ship was standing,"
8782,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Ladders let down, and gangplank set; a king"
8783,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Had sailed therein from Clusium. The ghost,"
8784,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The false Aeneas, hurrying, found shelter"
8785,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Deep in the hold, and Turnus followed after,"
8786,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Hot-foot through all delays, leaped onto the deck,"
8787,ARMS AND THE MAN,And had no sooner reached the bow than Juno
8788,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Broke off the mooring-lines, and the ship went scudding"
8789,ARMS AND THE MAN,Over the yielding sea. The real Aeneas
8790,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Kept calling Turnus to the fight, kept killing"
8791,ARMS AND THE MAN,Any who crossed his path. But the frail image
8792,ARMS AND THE MAN,"No longer sought a hiding-place, but swept"
8793,ARMS AND THE MAN,"High to the darker clouds, with Turnus riding"
8794,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The gale far out to seaward. Ignorant still,"
8795,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Ungrateful for reprieve, he looked to shore,"
8796,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Raising his hands to heaven, and praying:--“Father,"
8797,ARMS AND THE MAN,"What have I done, to be so tricked, so sullied?"
8798,ARMS AND THE MAN,What am I being punished for? Where am I?
8799,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Who am I, for that matter? Fugitive"
8800,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And coward, will I ever see again"
8801,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The camp, the walls? And all that band of heroes"
8802,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Who followed me and trusted me, I leave them"
8803,ARMS AND THE MAN,"In death unspeakable, I see them wheeling,"
8804,ARMS AND THE MAN,I hear their dying groans. What am I doing?
8805,ARMS AND THE MAN,"What gulf, what chasm, is deep enough to hide me?"
8806,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Pity me, winds; dash this accursèd vessel"
8807,ARMS AND THE MAN,"On rocks, on reefs, on any savage quicksands."
8808,ARMS AND THE MAN,"I, Turnus, plead with all my heart, ah, strand me"
8809,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Beyond all reach, where rumor or Rutulian"
8810,ARMS AND THE MAN,"May neither one pursue me.” His doubting spirit,"
8811,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Mad with so much disgrace, was undecided"
8812,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Whether to let the sword drive through the body,"
8813,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Or dive and swim for it, toward camp and Trojans."
8814,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Three times he tried each way, three times his hand,"
8815,ARMS AND THE MAN,"His will, were stayed by Juno in her mercy"
8816,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And the tall ship, on wind and tide, was carried"
8817,ARMS AND THE MAN,"On to Ardea, Daunus’ lofty city."
8818,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8819,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Meanwhile, at Jove’s command, Mezentius, burning,"
8820,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Entered the fight, swept through the cheering Trojans."
8821,ARMS AND THE MAN,The Etruscan ranks rush on; against Mezentius
8822,ARMS AND THE MAN,"All turn their hate, their weapons. But he stands"
8823,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Firm as a cliff, a jutting promontory"
8824,ARMS AND THE MAN,"In the great deep, exposed to the winds’ anger,"
8825,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Taking all violence of sky and ocean,"
8826,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Itself unmoved, immovable. Mezentius"
8827,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Slew Hebrus, son of Dolichaon, and with him"
8828,ARMS AND THE MAN,Latagus and the running Palmus; Palmus
8829,ARMS AND THE MAN,"He hamstrung from behind, and left him writhing,"
8830,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And gave his arms to Lausus, mail for his shoulders,"
8831,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Plumes for the helmet. A rock brought down Latagus,"
8832,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Smashing his mouth, full in the face. Evanthes"
8833,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Fell victim, and Paris’ comrade fell, that Mimas"
8834,ARMS AND THE MAN,Whose mother gave him birth on the same evening
8835,ARMS AND THE MAN,When Hecuba was delivered of her firebrand.
8836,ARMS AND THE MAN,"As a wild boar, sheltered for many years"
8837,ARMS AND THE MAN,"In woods of pine or tracts of marshland, nourished"
8838,ARMS AND THE MAN,"On reeds thick-grown, is driven from the mountains"
8839,ARMS AND THE MAN,"By the sharp-toothed hunting-dogs, and comes to the nets,"
8840,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And makes a stand, and snorts in savage anger,"
8841,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And bristles up his shoulders, and no one dares"
8842,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Come any nearer, but they all assail him"
8843,ARMS AND THE MAN,"At a safe distance, pelting him and shouting,"
8844,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And he is fierce and bold and very stubborn,"
8845,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Gnashing his teeth, and shaking off the weapons,"
8846,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Even so, like that wild boar, Mezentius held them"
8847,ARMS AND THE MAN,"At bay, all those who hated him; they dared not"
8848,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Close with the sword; they kept their distance, shouting,"
8849,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Assailing him, but out of reach, with missiles."
8850,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8851,ARMS AND THE MAN,"There was a youth named Acron, who had come"
8852,ARMS AND THE MAN,"From a Greek town, leaving his bride a virgin"
8853,ARMS AND THE MAN,At home in Corythus. Mezentius saw him
8854,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Bright in the ranks, flashing, maroon and crimson,"
8855,ARMS AND THE MAN,The colors of his bride. Mezentius saw him
8856,ARMS AND THE MAN,The way a hungry lion sees a deer
8857,ARMS AND THE MAN,And the jaws open and the mane is lifted
8858,ARMS AND THE MAN,And after one great leap the claws are fastened
8859,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Deep in the flank, and the mouth is red with slaughter."
8860,ARMS AND THE MAN,"So charged Mezentius into the midst, and Acron"
8861,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Went down, heels drumming on the ground, and blood"
8862,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Staining the broken spear. Orodes fled,"
8863,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Or tried to, but no spear for him; Mezentius"
8864,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Closed in, and struck with the sword, leaned on his spear,"
8865,ARMS AND THE MAN,"With one foot on the body, and cried aloud:--"
8866,ARMS AND THE MAN,"“Here lies Orodes, men, a mighty captain,"
8867,ARMS AND THE MAN,"No little bit of the war!” His comrades joined him,"
8868,ARMS AND THE MAN,Shouting applause; with his last breath Orodes
8869,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Managed an answer:--“Not for long, O foeman,"
8870,ARMS AND THE MAN,Shall I be unavenged: exult a little.
8871,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Your doom keeps watch; you will hold these fields, as I do,"
8872,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Before too long.” Mezentius, smiling at him,"
8873,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Said only, “Die; and let the sire of the gods,"
8874,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The king of men, look after me.” The steel"
8875,ARMS AND THE MAN,Came from the body; iron sleep and heavy
8876,ARMS AND THE MAN,Repose weighed down his eyes; they closed forever
8877,ARMS AND THE MAN,In night’s eternal dark.
8878,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8879,ARMS AND THE MAN,Caedicus slaughters
8880,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Alcathous, Sacrator kills Hydaspes,"
8881,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Rapo cuts two men down, Parthenius, Orses,"
8882,ARMS AND THE MAN,"A tough, strong fighter; Messapus slays Clonius,"
8883,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Lying, defenceless, on the ground, a rider"
8884,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Thrown when the bridle of the horse was broken,"
8885,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And Messapus slays another, Erichaetes,"
8886,ARMS AND THE MAN,Who tried to fight on foot; and Lycian Agis
8887,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Attempts to fight on foot, and meets Valerus,"
8888,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And finds him a stout foeman, like his fathers,"
8889,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And falls; and Thronius falls; his victor, Salius,"
8890,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Is victim of Nealces, a good fighter"
8891,ARMS AND THE MAN,With javelin and far-deceiving arrow.
8892,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The scales were balanced: Trojans and Rutulians,"
8893,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Arcadians, Etruscans, died and slaughtered."
8894,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Mars was a heavy-handed god, impartial"
8895,ARMS AND THE MAN,In dealing death and wounds. Victors and vanquished
8896,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Stood firm, in death or triumph, and the gods"
8897,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Pitied both sides and all that useless anger,"
8898,ARMS AND THE MAN,That suffering which mortals take in battle.
8899,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Venus is watching, and Saturnian Juno,"
8900,ARMS AND THE MAN,And pale Tisiphone through the hosts goes raging.
8901,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8902,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And now Mezentius, shaking his great spear,"
8903,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Sweeps like a whirlwind over the plain, a giant"
8904,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Huge as Orion, wading through the waters,"
8905,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Towering with his shoulders over the waves,"
8906,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Lugging an ancient ash-tree from the mountains,"
8907,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And his head hidden in the clouds of heaven,"
8908,ARMS AND THE MAN,"So looms Mezentius, monstrous in his armor,"
8909,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And, from the other side, Aeneas sees him,"
8910,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And moves to meet him, and Mezentius stands there,"
8911,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Unfrightened, heavy-set, waiting his foe."
8912,ARMS AND THE MAN,"He eyes the distance that the spear may need,"
8913,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Indulges in mock prayer:--“Let my right hand,"
8914,ARMS AND THE MAN,"That is to say, my god, and the dart I balance"
8915,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Favor me now! And as a trophy, Lausus,"
8916,ARMS AND THE MAN,"I vow yourself, my son, to carry, living,"
8917,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The spoil stripped from this robber.” The spear flew on,"
8918,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Glanced from the shield, wounded the knight Antores"
8919,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Between the side and thigh; Evander’s ally,"
8920,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Hercules’ comrade, a man from Argos, he falls,"
8921,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Killed by a wound meant for another; dying,"
8922,ARMS AND THE MAN,He thinks of his dear Argos. And Aeneas
8923,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Lets drive his spear: it penetrates the shield,"
8924,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The triple bronze, the layers of leather, biting"
8925,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Deep in the groin, not going through. And happy"
8926,ARMS AND THE MAN,"At sight of Tuscan blood, Aeneas draws"
8927,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Sword from his side, comes hotly on; Mezentius"
8928,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Staggers, and Lausus grieves; he loves his father,"
8929,ARMS AND THE MAN,The tears stream down his face.
8930,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Mezentius, dragging back, useless, disabled,"
8931,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Slowly gives ground, the hostile spear still trailing,"
8932,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Still fastened to the shield. Lausus runs forward,"
8933,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Lifts his right arm and strikes. Aeneas parries,"
8934,ARMS AND THE MAN,Lausus is halted. But his comrades follow--
8935,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The father, with the son’s protecting shield,"
8936,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Has, still, a chance of safety. Missiles shower"
8937,ARMS AND THE MAN,"From all sides at Aeneas: though he rages,"
8938,ARMS AND THE MAN,"He huddles under shelter, like a farmer"
8939,ARMS AND THE MAN,"When hailstones rattle down, or any traveller"
8940,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Seeking what he can find, a river bank,"
8941,ARMS AND THE MAN,"An overhanging rock, or any cover"
8942,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Until the downpour stops, and the sun returns"
8943,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Men to their daily labor: so Aeneas,"
8944,ARMS AND THE MAN,"With javelins thickening, every way, against him,"
8945,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Endures the storm of war, and threatens Lausus:--"
8946,ARMS AND THE MAN,“What rush to death is this? What silly daring
8947,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Beyond the limit of strength? O foolish youngster,"
8948,ARMS AND THE MAN,"You love your father, I know, but fool yourself"
8949,ARMS AND THE MAN,"With too much loving.” Lausus, in his madness,"
8950,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Has never a thought of stopping, and Aeneas"
8951,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Feels anger rise against him, and the Fates"
8952,ARMS AND THE MAN,Tie off the ends of Lausus’ thread: the Trojan
8953,ARMS AND THE MAN,Drives with the sword; it is buried in the body
8954,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Deep to the hilt. The little shield, frail armor"
8955,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Against so great a menace, could not hold it."
8956,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The pliant tunic, woven by his mother"
8957,ARMS AND THE MAN,"With golden thread, is no more help; the blood"
8958,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Stains it another color, and through air"
8959,ARMS AND THE MAN,The life went sorrowing to the shades. And now
8960,ARMS AND THE MAN,Aeneas changes. Looking on that face
8961,ARMS AND THE MAN,"So pale in death, he groans in pity; he reaches"
8962,ARMS AND THE MAN,"As if to touch him with his hand, in comfort,"
8963,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Knowing, himself, how one can love a father."
8964,ARMS AND THE MAN,"“Poor boy, what tribute can Aeneas offer,"
8965,ARMS AND THE MAN,What praise for so much glory? Keep the armor
8966,ARMS AND THE MAN,You loved so much: if there is any comfort
8967,ARMS AND THE MAN,"In burial at home, know I release you"
8968,ARMS AND THE MAN,"To your ancestral shades and ashes. Further,"
8969,ARMS AND THE MAN,"You have one solace, this, that you have fallen"
8970,ARMS AND THE MAN,By great Aeneas’ hand.” He lifted Lausus
8971,ARMS AND THE MAN,"From the bloody ground and raised the head, that dust"
8972,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And earth and blood should not defile its glory,"
8973,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And called the Etruscans closer, scornful of them,"
8974,ARMS AND THE MAN,Over their hesitation.
8975,ARMS AND THE MAN,
8976,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Meanwhile, Mezentius, by the wave of the river,"
8977,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Propped his slumped frame against a tree-trunk, staunching"
8978,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The wound with water. The bronze helmet hung,"
8979,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Inverted, from the bough; the heavy arms"
8980,ARMS AND THE MAN,Lay quiet on the meadow. Chosen men
8981,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Were standing by. Sick, and with labored breath,"
8982,ARMS AND THE MAN,"He let his chin fall forward, rubbed his neck,"
8983,ARMS AND THE MAN,While over his chest the flowing beard was streaming.
8984,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Over and over again, he asks and sends"
8985,ARMS AND THE MAN,"For Lausus: bring him back, he tells the men,"
8986,ARMS AND THE MAN,Those are the orders from his unhappy father.
8987,ARMS AND THE MAN,"But they were bringing him back, a big man slain"
8988,ARMS AND THE MAN,By a big wound. Mezentius knew the sound
8989,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Of sorrow from afar, before he heard it,"
8990,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Fouled his gray hair with dust, flung up his arms,"
8991,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Clung to the body. “O my son, my son,"
8992,ARMS AND THE MAN,Was I so fond of living that I sent
8993,ARMS AND THE MAN,"You to the sword for me, saved by your wounds,"
8994,ARMS AND THE MAN,Alive when you are dead? The wound indeed
8995,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Is driven deep, the bitterness of death"
8996,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Comes home. I was the one, my son, my son,"
8997,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Who stained your name with crime, with hatred, driven"
8998,ARMS AND THE MAN,From throne and sceptre. I have owed too long
8999,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The debt of punishment, and here I am,"
9000,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Living, and never leaving men and light,"
9001,ARMS AND THE MAN,"But I shall leave.” He heaved his sickened weight,"
9002,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Pulling himself together, groin and all,"
9003,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Slowly. The wound was deep, but he could stand."
9004,ARMS AND THE MAN,"He ordered them to bring his horse, that solace,"
9005,ARMS AND THE MAN,"That pride of his, on which he used to ride"
9006,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Victorious out of all the wars. He spoke,"
9007,ARMS AND THE MAN,And the beast sorrowed with his master’s sorrow:--
9008,ARMS AND THE MAN,"“Rhoebus, if anything is ever long"
9009,ARMS AND THE MAN,"For mortal beings, you and I have lived"
9010,ARMS AND THE MAN,For a long time. Today you carry back
9011,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Those bloody spoils, Aeneas’ arms, avenging"
9012,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The pangs of Lausus with me, or we both,"
9013,ARMS AND THE MAN,"If no force clears the way, go down together,"
9014,ARMS AND THE MAN,"O bravest heart, too noble to endure"
9015,ARMS AND THE MAN,The stranger’s order and the Trojan rider.”
9016,ARMS AND THE MAN,"He swung astride, shifted his weight a little,"
9017,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The way he always did, held in both hands"
9018,ARMS AND THE MAN,"A load of darts. The helmet glittered bronze,"
9019,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The horsehair plume was bristling as he rode,"
9020,ARMS AND THE MAN,Madness and grief and shame all urging on
9021,ARMS AND THE MAN,"That singleness of purpose. He came on fast,"
9022,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Calling, _Aeneas! Aeneas!_ over and over,"
9023,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And his voice was loud and firm. Aeneas heard,"
9024,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Rejoiced, and recognized, and made his prayer:--"
9025,ARMS AND THE MAN,"“Let this be true, O father of the gods,"
9026,ARMS AND THE MAN,"O high Apollo!""--then, to his foe, “Come on!”"
9027,ARMS AND THE MAN,And moved to meet him with the deadly spear.
9028,ARMS AND THE MAN,Mezentius answered:--“Do you frighten me
9029,ARMS AND THE MAN,"With all that fierceness, now that my son is taken?"
9030,ARMS AND THE MAN,How meaningless! That was the only way
9031,ARMS AND THE MAN,"You could destroy me. Now I fear no death,"
9032,ARMS AND THE MAN,I spare no god. Be quiet; for I come
9033,ARMS AND THE MAN,"To die, but first of all I bring you this,"
9034,ARMS AND THE MAN,"A present from me,""--and he flung the dart,"
9035,ARMS AND THE MAN,"And flung another, and another, wheeling"
9036,ARMS AND THE MAN,In a great arc. The boss of gold held strong.
9037,ARMS AND THE MAN,Three times in circles to the left he rode
9038,ARMS AND THE MAN,Around the steady Trojan; thrice the hand
9039,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Let fly the dart, and thrice the shield of bronze"
9040,ARMS AND THE MAN,Was a great forest with its load of spears.
9041,ARMS AND THE MAN,"All this was wearisome,--too many darts,"
9042,ARMS AND THE MAN,Too much defensiveness. Aeneas broke
9043,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Out of the watchful attitude, and flung"
9044,ARMS AND THE MAN,The spear between the charger’s hollow temples.
9045,ARMS AND THE MAN,"The great beast reared with fore-hooves flailing air,"
9046,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Throwing the rider, and came tumbling down"
9047,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Head-foremost on him, shoulder out of joint."
9048,ARMS AND THE MAN,Trojan and Latin uproar swelled to heaven.
9049,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Aeneas, sword-blade ready, rushes in:--"
9050,ARMS AND THE MAN,"“Where is the fierce Mezentius now, and where"
9051,ARMS AND THE MAN,"All that wild rage of spirit?” But the king,"
9052,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Raising his eyes, drank in the sky a little,"
9053,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Knew a brief moment of recovery,"
9054,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Enough to say:--“O bitter enemy,"
9055,ARMS AND THE MAN,Why all the tauntings and the threats of death?
9056,ARMS AND THE MAN,There is no wrong in slaughter: neither I
9057,ARMS AND THE MAN,Nor Lausus ever made such battle-pledges.
9058,ARMS AND THE MAN,"One thing I ask, if beaten enemies"
9059,ARMS AND THE MAN,Have any claim on mercy. Let my body
9060,ARMS AND THE MAN,Be granted burial. I know the hate
9061,ARMS AND THE MAN,Of my own people rages round me. Keep
9062,ARMS AND THE MAN,Their fury from me. Let me share the grave
9063,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Of my dear son.” He said no more, but welcomed,"
9064,ARMS AND THE MAN,"Fully aware, the sword-thrust in the throat,"
9065,ARMS AND THE MAN,And poured his life in crimson over the armor.

9074,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
9075,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Meanwhile Aurora, rising, left the ocean."
9076,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Aeneas’ heart was troubled--so much dying,"
9077,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"So great a need for funeral rites,--but first"
9078,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Vows must be paid for victory. At dawn
9079,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"He sets an oak-trunk on a mound, the branches"
9080,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Stripped off on every side, and hangs upon it"
9081,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Mezentius’ gleaming arms, the war-god’s trophy."
9082,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"He adds the crest, blood-stained, the broken darts,"
9083,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The riddled breast-plate; binds, to the left, the shield,"
9084,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Hangs from the neck the ivory sword. His comrades
9085,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Hail him, and gather close around, and listen:--"
9086,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"“The greatest task is done: as for the future,"
9087,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Fear not, my heroes! Here are spoils and first-fruits"
9088,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Of one proud king; Mezentius is in our hands.
9089,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"We march, now, on Latinus and his cities."
9090,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Prepare your arms, your nerve; let your hopes run"
9091,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Onward before the war. When the gods grant us
9092,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,To raise our standards and to lead our army
9093,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Out of this camp, let no delay impede us"
9094,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Through ignorance, no fear retard our courage."
9095,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Meanwhile, let us commit to earth the unburied bodies"
9096,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Of our dear comrades, for no other honor"
9097,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Waits them below the world. Go, offer homage,"
9098,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,The final rites to those whose blood has won us
9099,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,This fatherland; let Pallas be sent home
9100,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,To the mourning city of Evander: Pallas
9101,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Had courage, and the day was black that took him"
9102,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,To the bitterness of death.”
9103,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
9104,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,He spoke with tears
9105,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And went back to the threshold, where old Acoetes,"
9106,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"An armor-bearer, once, to king Evander,"
9107,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And then, less happily, guardian over Pallas,"
9108,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Kept watch beside the body. A Trojan throng
9109,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Stood all around, an honor-guard, and the women"
9110,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Loosened their hair in ceremonial mourning,"
9111,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And when Aeneas came, the lofty portal"
9112,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Sounded with groaning and with lamentation,"
9113,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And wailing reached the stars. He looked at Pallas,"
9114,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The pillowed head, the face as white as snow,"
9115,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The jagged wound in the smooth breast, and spoke,"
9116,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And could not check his weeping:--“Ah, poor youngster!"
9117,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Fortune, a little while, was happy for us"
9118,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And then turned evil and grudging, and refused me"
9119,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,The joy of seeing you ride back in triumph
9120,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,To your father’s house with news of our new kingdom.
9121,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"I have not kept my promise to Evander,"
9122,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Whose arms went round me when I left, who sent me"
9123,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"To win great empire, and who gave me warning"
9124,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"That these were men of spirit, tough in battle."
9125,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And now, perhaps even at this very moment,"
9126,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The dupe of empty hope, he is making prayers,"
9127,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Heaping the altars high with gifts, while we"
9128,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"In sorrow attend his lifeless son, with honor"
9129,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"As empty as the father’s hope, for Pallas"
9130,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Owes nothing more to any god in heaven.
9131,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Unhappy Evander, our long-awaited triumph,"
9132,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Our glorious return, comes to this only,"
9133,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,The bitter funeral of a son; and so
9134,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Aeneas keeps his promise!
9135,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
9136,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And yet, O king,"
9137,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"You will not see him slain by shameful wounds,"
9138,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,You will not long for a dire death to cancel
9139,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The memory of a son, safe, but a coward."
9140,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"We have lost a great protection, all of us,"
9141,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Ausonia, Iulus.”"
9142,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
9143,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,He gave orders
9144,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"To raise the pitiful body for its journey,"
9145,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,And chose a thousand men to honor Pallas
9146,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"With this last escort, to share Evander’s tears,"
9147,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Poor comfort for so great a grief, but due him."
9148,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Men weave the bier with osier and soft willow
9149,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And shadow it over with leaves of oak, and Pallas"
9150,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Rests on his country litter, like a flower"
9151,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Some girl has picked and lost, a violet"
9152,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Or drooping hyacinth, and all its luster"
9153,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Still there, though earth is kind to it no longer."
9154,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And then Aeneas brought two robes, whose crimson"
9155,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Was stiff with gold, robes that the queen of Carthage"
9156,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Had woven for him, happy in her labor,"
9157,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Running the gold through crimson. Over Pallas
9158,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The robes are cast, the sad and final honor,"
9159,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The hair is veiled for the fire, and many trophies"
9160,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Are added, prizes from the Latin battles,"
9161,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Horses, and weapons, captured from the Latins,"
9162,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And human victims, offerings to the shades,"
9163,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Their blood to sprinkle funeral fire, are led"
9164,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Hands bound behind them, and the names of foemen"
9165,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Are cut in the trunks of trees that bear their armor.
9166,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Unhappy old Acoetes trudges with them,"
9167,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Beating his breast, clawing his face, or flinging"
9168,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,His wretched body down in the dust. And chariots
9169,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Follow, Rutulian blood on wheel and axle,"
9170,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And Pallas’ war-horse Aethon, riderless,"
9171,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Without caparison, weeps for his master,"
9172,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,The great tears rolling down. Other men carry
9173,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The spear and helmet only, for the rest"
9174,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Turnus had taken as spoil. And then there follows
9175,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"A long array of mourners, Trojans, Tuscans,"
9176,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Arcadians, with arms reversed: so they pass"
9177,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"In long procession, comrade after comrade,"
9178,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Far on and almost out of sight. Aeneas
9179,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Halts, and sighs deeply:--“The same grim fates of war"
9180,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Call us from here to other tears. Forever
9181,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Hail, O great Pallas, and farewell forever!”"
9182,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"He said no more, but turned to the high walls,"
9183,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Strode back to the camp.
9184,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
9185,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,And envoys came
9186,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"From the Latin city, veiled with boughs of olive,"
9187,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Asking for truce: let him return the bodies
9188,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Strewn by the sword across the battlefield,"
9189,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Let them be given burial. No war
9190,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Is fought with vanquished men, deprived of light:"
9191,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Let him be merciful--had he not called them
9192,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Hosts at one time, and fathers? And good Aeneas"
9193,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Granted, of right, the truce they sought, and added"
9194,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Brief words:--“What evil destiny, O Latins,"
9195,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Involved you in such tragic war, to flee us,"
9196,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Your friends that might have been? You ask for peace,"
9197,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Peace for the dead, slain by the lot of battle."
9198,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Peace? I would gladly grant it to the living.
9199,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,I would not be here unless fate had given
9200,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"This place, this dwelling, and I wage no war"
9201,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Against your people, but your king deserted"
9202,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Our friendliness; he had more confidence
9203,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"In Turnus’ weapons. Turnus, in simple justice,"
9204,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Should be the one to face this death. If, truly,"
9205,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"He seeks to end the war, to drive the Trojans"
9206,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"By strength of hand from Italy, he should have"
9207,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Taken my personal challenge: one of us
9208,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Would live, to whom his own right hand or heaven"
9209,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Had granted life. Go now, depart in peace,"
9210,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Kindle the death-fires for your luckless comrades.”
9211,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"He spoke, and they were silent: they had nothing"
9212,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"That could be said; they could not face him, either,"
9213,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,And kept their eyes and faces toward each other.
9214,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
9215,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And then old Drances, always bitter and hateful,"
9216,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Resentful of young Turnus, spoke in answer:--"
9217,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"“O great in glory, even greater in arms,"
9218,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Heroic Trojan, how can I ever praise you"
9219,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,As highly as I should? Am I to wonder
9220,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,First at your justice or your warlike prowess?
9221,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"We shall be glad, indeed, to take these words"
9222,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Back to our native city and, fortune willing,"
9223,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Join you with king Latinus. As for Turnus,"
9224,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Let him seek his own alliances! Our pleasure
9225,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Will be in building walls for you, as fate"
9226,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Ordains, that we should carry on our shoulders"
9227,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,The masonry of Troy.” And they all cheered him.
9228,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"They pledged twelve days for peace, and in the forests"
9229,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Trojans and Latins walked as friends together,"
9230,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Over the ridges, peace among them. Ash-trees"
9231,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Rang as the two-edged axe bit deep; the pines,"
9232,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Star-towering, came down; the oak, the cedar,"
9233,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Split by the wedges, filled the groaning wagons."
9234,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
9235,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And Rumor, messenger of all that mourning,"
9236,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Came flying to Evander’s home and city,"
9237,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Rumor, so short a time before the herald"
9238,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Of victories in Latium for young Pallas.
9239,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Out to the gates came the Arcadians; torches,"
9240,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Carried aloft, after the ancient custom,"
9241,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Marked off the fields from highway; the long road
9242,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Shone with the light of fire, and the Trojans, coming,"
9243,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Met their lament, and when the mothers saw them,"
9244,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,The city itself was one great fire of mourning.
9245,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"No force could hold Evander back: he came,"
9246,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Rushing, into the sad procession’s center,"
9247,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And where the barrow halted, clung to Pallas,"
9248,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Weeping and groaning, and his voice could hardly"
9249,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Manage its way through choking sobs:--“Ah, Pallas,"
9250,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,You have not kept your promise to your father!
9251,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,You said you would be careful in the battles!
9252,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"I knew, I knew too well, how much new glory,"
9253,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"How much the sweet fresh pride in the first battle,"
9254,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Could overpower discretion. Here are the first-fruits
9255,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Of your young manhood; here are the cruel lessons
9256,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Of war brought home; and all my prayers unheeded
9257,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"By any god! But my dear wife is happy,"
9258,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Spared, by her death, this anguish. I live on,"
9259,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"I have overcome my fate by living so,"
9260,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,A father who survives his son. I should have
9261,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Followed the Trojan arms, let the Rutulians"
9262,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"O’erwhelm me with their darts; I should have died,"
9263,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And this procession brought me home, not Pallas."
9264,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"It is not your fault, O Trojans; I do not blame you,"
9265,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The treaties joined, the hands we clasped, in friendship."
9266,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"No: this was coming to me, this was due"
9267,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,The lot of my old age. An early death
9268,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Took off my son; I shall rejoice, hereafter,"
9269,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Knowing he led the Trojans into Latium,"
9270,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Slew Volscians by the thousands. He was worthy,"
9271,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Pallas, my son, of such a death. Aeneas,"
9272,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The mighty Trojans, the Etruscan captains,"
9273,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The Etruscan ranks, all think so. They bring trophies,"
9274,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Great trophies, those my son brought low; and Turnus"
9275,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Would be another trophy, were his years,"
9276,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"His strength, the same as his young enemy’s."
9277,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"But why am I, unhappy man, delaying"
9278,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,The Trojan hosts from battle? Go: remember
9279,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"To tell Aeneas this: I keep on living,"
9280,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"However hateful life may be, with Pallas"
9281,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Taken away from me, I keep on living"
9282,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Because of his right hand: it owes me something,"
9283,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The death of Turnus, for the son and father."
9284,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And this Aeneas knows, the one thing wanting"
9285,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,To make his praise and fortune sure. I ask
9286,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,No joy in life--that is impossible--
9287,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"But only this one thing, to take my son,"
9288,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"In the shades below, one message: Turnus has fallen.”"
9289,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
9290,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Meanwhile the dawn had brought to weary mortals
9291,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Her kindly light, and work again, and labors."
9292,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Along the winding shore Aeneas, Tarchon,"
9293,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Set up the pyres, and all, as had their fathers,"
9294,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Brought bodies of their kinsmen, lit the fires"
9295,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"That burned, but darkly, and the light of heaven"
9296,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Was hidden by the blackness of that shadow.
9297,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Three times, in glittering armor, they went riding"
9298,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Around the funeral blaze, three times they circled"
9299,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,The mournful fire and cried with wailing voices.
9300,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Tears fell on earth and armor; heaven heard
9301,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The groans of men, the blare of trumpet. Spoils"
9302,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Went to the fire, the handsome swords, the helmets,"
9303,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Bridles and shining wheels, and well-known gifts"
9304,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"For men who died, their shields, their luckless weapons."
9305,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Bullocks were slain, and bristly swine, and sheep"
9306,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"From all the fields, homage to fire and death,"
9307,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And all along the shore, they watched their comrades"
9308,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Burn on the pyres, and guarded the dead embers,"
9309,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And could not leave till day had gone, and night"
9310,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Dewy with gleaming stars rolled over heaven.
9311,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
9312,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,And elsewhere in the countryside the Latins
9313,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Built, as the Trojans had, pyres without number."
9314,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Many were slain, and many men were buried"
9315,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Where they had fallen, and many men sent home"
9316,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"To their own cities, and many no one knew,"
9317,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"No one could mark with honor or distinction,"
9318,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,And these were given one common pyre; the fields
9319,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Rivalled each other as the fires kept burning.
9320,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Three days had gone; and over bones and ashes
9321,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"They heaped the earth, still warm. Inside the walls,"
9322,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Within the city of that rich king Latinus,"
9323,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Grief swelled from murmur to wailing, to loud uproar,"
9324,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The greatest share of sorrow. Brides and mothers,"
9325,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Sisters and fatherless boys, crying and cursing,"
9326,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Denounced the evil war and Turnus’ marriage.
9327,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"They call on him, on Turnus alone, to settle"
9328,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The issue with the sword; he is the one,"
9329,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Their accusation cries, who wants the kingdom,"
9330,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"All Italy for himself, and the highest honors."
9331,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And Drances, savage, tips the balance further:"
9332,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Turnus, alone, (he says) is called on, Turnus"
9333,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Alone is called to battle. But against them
9334,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Many a man has good to say of Turnus,"
9335,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And the shadow of the queen’s great name protects him,"
9336,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,And he has been a mighty man in battle.
9337,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
9338,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And during all this swirling burning tumult,"
9339,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Envoys, who came from Diomede’s great city,"
9340,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Brought gloomy news: nothing had been accomplished
9341,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,With all that toil and trouble; nothing gained
9342,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"By gifts or gold or pleading, and the Latins"
9343,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Were left two choices, to seek for other allies"
9344,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Or ask Aeneas for peace. Under the burden
9345,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Of that great grief even Latinus falters.
9346,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Aeneas is called by fate, the will of heaven"
9347,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Is clear, the gods are angry; the fresh graves,"
9348,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Before their eyes, bear more than ample witness."
9349,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Therefore, he calls a council; all his leaders"
9350,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Stream through the crowded highways to the palace,"
9351,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And in their midst, the oldest man among them,"
9352,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The first in power, Latinus, far from happy,"
9353,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Speaks from his throne,--the messengers from Arpi"
9354,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Should tell what news they bring, in proper order,"
9355,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Sparing no single item. All were silent,"
9356,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Obedient to his word, and Venulus"
9357,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Gave the report:--“O citizens, we have seen"
9358,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The Argive camp, and Diomede. We made"
9359,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,The journey safely through all kinds of perils.
9360,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,We have touched the hand by which Troy fell. That hero
9361,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Has his own city now, named from his father,"
9362,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"In Garganus’ conquered fields. We entered there,"
9363,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Had leave to speak, offered our gifts, and told him"
9364,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Our name and country, why we came to Arpi,"
9365,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Who made war on us. He listened to our story
9366,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And answered us, quite calmly. These are his words:--"
9367,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
9368,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"‘O happy people of the realm of Saturn,"
9369,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Ancient Ausonians, what chance, what fortune"
9370,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Disturbs your rest, leads you to unknown warfare?"
9371,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"All of us, every one, who desecrated"
9372,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,The fields of Troy with steel--I do not mention
9373,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"All that we suffered under those high walls,"
9374,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Or heroes drowned in Simois--every one,"
9375,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"All over the world, has paid and kept on paying"
9376,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"All kinds of punishment, all kinds of torture,"
9377,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,A band that even Priam would have to pity.
9378,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Minerva knows it, with her baleful star,"
9379,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Euboea’s headland knows it, and Caphereus,"
9380,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,That cape of vengeance. From that warfare driven
9381,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Ulysses faced the Cyclops; Menelaus
9382,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Was exiled far to the west. Idomeneus
9383,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Lost Crete: what need is there to mention Pyrrhus,"
9384,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,To name the Locrians on Libya’s coastline?
9385,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Even the Greeks’ great captain, Agamemnon,"
9386,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Met shame beyond his threshold; Clytemnestra
9387,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Struck with her evil hand,--the king of men,"
9388,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The conqueror of Asia, fell, a cuckold"
9389,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Murdered in his own palace, at Mycenae."
9390,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,To me the gods were kinder; they would not let me
9391,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"See home again, the wife I loved, the altars"
9392,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Of lovely Calydon; here I am, still haunted"
9393,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,By portents horrible to see--my comrades
9394,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Lost, seeking heaven on their wings, or aimless"
9395,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Along the rivers, crying in shrill voices"
9396,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Around the rocks, creatures of lamentation"
9397,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,That once were men! The gods know how to punish.
9398,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"This, so it seems, was what I had to hope for"
9399,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Ever since that first moment of my madness
9400,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,When I took steel in hand and wounded Venus.
9401,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"No, no; do not invite me to such battles."
9402,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,The walls of Troy have fallen; I have no quarrel
9403,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,With any Trojans any more. Those evils
9404,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"I have forgotten, or, if I remember,"
9405,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,I find no pleasure in them. Take Aeneas
9406,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,The gifts you bring me from your native country.
9407,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"I have stood up against his terrible weapons,"
9408,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"I have fought him hand to hand. Believe an expert,"
9409,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Take it from one who knows, how huge he rises"
9410,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Above that shield of his, with what a whirlwind"
9411,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,He rifles out that spear. If Troy had only
9412,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Two other men as good, Greece would be mourning"
9413,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"With doom the other way, and the towns of Argos"
9414,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Admit the conqueror. For ten long years
9415,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"They kept us waiting at that stubborn city,"
9416,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,And the Greek victory was at a standstill
9417,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Through Hector and Aeneas; both were famous
9418,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"In spirit, both in feats of arms, Aeneas"
9419,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The more devoted man. I tell you, join them"
9420,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"In treaty, on what terms you can. I warn you,"
9421,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Beware, beware, of facing them in battle.’"
9422,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
9423,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"So you have heard, great king, Diomede’s answer"
9424,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,And what he thinks of this great war.”
9425,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
9426,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,The sound
9427,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Rose, as he ended, like the sound of water"
9428,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"When rocks delay a flood, and the banks re-echo"
9429,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The stir and protest of the angry river,"
9430,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Confusion, argument, in swirl and eddy,--"
9431,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"So the Ausonians brawled among each other,"
9432,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Muttered, and then subsided; and king Latinus"
9433,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Spoke from his lofty throne:--“I wish, O Latins,"
9434,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Decision had been taken in such matters
9435,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,A long while since; that would have been much better.
9436,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,This is no time for councils to be summoned.
9437,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,The enemy is at the gate. We are waging
9438,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,A most unhappy war against a people
9439,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Descended from the gods; we cannot beat them.
9440,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"No battles wear them down; if they are conquered,"
9441,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,They cannot let the sword fall from the hand.
9442,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Whatever hope you had in Diomede,"
9443,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Forget it. All your hope is what you are,"
9444,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,But you can see how little that amounts to.
9445,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,You have it all before your eyes; you have it
9446,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"In your own hands, and most of it is ruin."
9447,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,I lay no blame on any man; what valor
9448,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Could do, it has done: the body of our kingdom"
9449,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Has fought with all its strength. We are bled to the white.
9450,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Hear, then, what I propose; I am not yet certain"
9451,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Entirely--here it is, in brief. We have"
9452,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"An ancient tract of land, far to the west,"
9453,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Touching the Tuscan river, where our natives,"
9454,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Rutulians, Auruncans, sow and harrow"
9455,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The stubborn hills, rough land and cattle country."
9456,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Let all this region and its high pine-forest
9457,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Be ceded to the Trojans out of friendship;
9458,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Let us make fair terms and have them share our kingdom.
9459,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Here they may build and settle if they want to.
9460,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"But if their minds are bent on other borders,"
9461,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"On any other nation, if they are able"
9462,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"To leave our soil, let us build a navy for them,"
9463,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Twenty good ships of oak, more if they need them."
9464,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,We have the timber at the water’s edge;
9465,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"All they need tell us is what kind, how many,"
9466,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"For us to give them workmen, bronze, and dockyards."
9467,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,A hundred spokesmen from the noblest Latins
9468,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Should go with boughs of olive, bearing presents,"
9469,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Talents of gold and ivory, the robe,"
9470,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The throne, of state, symbols of our dominion."
9471,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Consult together; help our weary fortunes.”
9472,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
9473,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Then Drances, hostile still, whom Turnus’ glory"
9474,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Goaded with envy’s bitter sting, arose,"
9475,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"A man of wealth, better than good with his tongue;"
9476,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"If not so fierce in war, no fool in council,"
9477,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"A trouble-maker, though; his mother was noble,"
9478,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,His father no-one much. He spoke in anger:--
9479,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"“Good king, you ask our guidance in a matter"
9480,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Obscure to none, needing no word of ours."
9481,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"All know, admit they know, what fortune orders,"
9482,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Yet mutter rather than speak. Let him abate
9483,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"That bluster of his, through whose disastrous ways"
9484,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Evil has come upon us, and bad omens."
9485,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"I will speak out, however much he threaten."
9486,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Let us have freedom to speak frankly. Mourning
9487,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Has settled on the town, the light of the leaders"
9488,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Dies out in darkness, while that confident hero,"
9489,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Confident, but in flight, attacks the Trojans"
9490,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,And frightens heaven with arms. To all these gifts
9491,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Promised and sent the Trojans, add, O king,"
9492,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,One more: let no one’s violence dissuade you
9493,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"From giving your daughter in a worthy marriage,"
9494,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,An everlasting covenant between us.
9495,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"But if such terror holds our hearts, then let us"
9496,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Beseech this prince, sue for his royal favor,"
9497,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Let him give up his claim, for king and country."
9498,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Why, Turnus, fountain-head of all our troubles"
9499,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Consign us, wretches that we are, to danger"
9500,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Open and often? In war there is no safety.
9501,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Turnus, we ask for peace, and, to confirm it,"
9502,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The only proper pledge. You know I hate you,"
9503,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Make no mistake in that regard. But still,"
9504,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"I, first of all, implore you, pity your people!"
9505,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Put off that pride: give in, give up, and leave us!"
9506,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,We have seen enough of death and desolation.
9507,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"If glory moves you, you with the heart of oak,"
9508,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Or if the royal dowry is your passion,"
9509,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Be bold, have confidence,--and face Aeneas!"
9510,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"So Turnus have his royal bride, no matter"
9511,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"If we, cheap souls, a herd unwept, unburied,"
9512,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Lie strewn across the field. O son of Mars,"
9513,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"If son you really are, the challenger"
9514,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Is calling: dare you look him in the face?”
9515,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
9516,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And Turnus’ violence blazed out in fury,"
9517,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,A groan or a growl and savage words erupting:--
9518,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"“A flow of talk is what you have, O Drances,"
9519,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Always, when wars need men; and you come running"
9520,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The first one there, whenever the senate gathers."
9521,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"But this is not the time for words, that fly"
9522,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"From your big mouth in safety, in a meeting,"
9523,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"While the walls keep off the foe, and the dry trenches"
9524,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Have not yet swum in blood. As usual,"
9525,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Orator, thunder on! Convict me, Drances,"
9526,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Of cowardice, you having slain so many"
9527,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Tremendous heaps of Trojans, all the fields"
9528,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Stacked with your trophies! Try your courage, Drances:"
9529,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The enemy are not far to seek, our walls"
9530,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Are circled with them. Coming? Why the coyness?
9531,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Will your idea of Mars be found forever
9532,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"In windy tongue and flying feet? I, beaten?"
9533,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Who says so? What foul liar calls me beaten,"
9534,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Seeing the Tiber red with blood, Evander"
9535,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Laid low with all his house, and the Arcadians"
9536,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Stripped of their arms? Ask Pandarus and Bitias,"
9537,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The thousands I have sent to hell, cut off"
9538,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Inside their walls, hedged by a ring of foemen."
9539,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"_In war there is no safety._ Sing that song,"
9540,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Madman, to your own cause and prince Aeneas!"
9541,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Keep on, don’t stop, confound confusion further"
9542,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"With panic fear, and praise those noble heroes"
9543,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Of that twice-beaten race, despite the arms"
9544,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Of King Latinus. Now the Myrmidons,"
9545,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Or so we hear, are trembling, and their river"
9546,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Runs backward in sheer fright, and Diomedes"
9547,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Turns pale, and I suppose Achilles also!"
9548,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Now he pretends my threats, my anger, scare him--"
9549,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,A nice artistic piece of work!--he sharpens
9550,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Slander with apprehension. Listen to him!
9551,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Listen to me: I tell you, you will never"
9552,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Lose such a life as yours by this right hand,"
9553,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Quit worrying, keep that great and fighting spirit"
9554,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Forever in that breast! And now, my father,"
9555,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,I turn to you and more important counsels.
9556,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"If you have hope no longer in our arms,"
9557,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"If we are so forsaken, if we are lost,"
9558,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Utterly, over one repulse, if fortune"
9559,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Cannot retrace her steps, let us pray for peace,"
9560,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Let us hold out helpless hands in supplication.
9561,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"But still, if only some of our valor, something--"
9562,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Happy the men who died before they saw it!
9563,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"But if we still have any power, warriors"
9564,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Standing unhurt, any Italian city,"
9565,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Any ally at all, if any Trojans"
9566,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Have ever died (their glory has been costly
9567,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"As well as ours, and the storm has no more spared them),"
9568,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Why do we fail like cowards on the edge
9569,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Of victory? Why do we shudder and tremble
9570,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Before the trumpet sounds? Many an evil
9571,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Has turned to good in time; and many a mortal
9572,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Fate has despised and raised. Diomede, Arpi,"
9573,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Refuse us help; so be it. There are others,"
9574,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"There is Messapus for one, Tolumnius"
9575,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Whose luck is good, and all those other leaders"
9576,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Sent by so many nations, and great glory"
9577,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Will follow Latium’s pride. We have Camilla
9578,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Of Volscian stock, leading her troop of horsemen,"
9579,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Her warriors bright in bronze. If I am summoned
9580,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Alone to meet Aeneas, if I alone"
9581,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Am obstinate about the common welfare,"
9582,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"If such is your decision, my hands have never"
9583,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Found victory so shrinking or elusive
9584,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,That I should fear the risk. Bring on your Trojan!
9585,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Let him surpass Achilles, and wear armor"
9586,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Made by the hands of Vulcan! Second to no one
9587,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Of all my ancestors in pride and courage,"
9588,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"I, Turnus, vow this life to you, Latinus,"
9589,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"My king, my father. _The challenger is calling_--"
9590,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Well, let him call, I hope he does. No Drances,"
9591,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"If heaven’s wrath is here, will ever appease it,"
9592,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,No Drances take away my honor and glory.”
9593,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
9594,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"So, in the midst of doubt, they brawled and quarreled,"
9595,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,And all the time Aeneas’ line came forward.
9596,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"A messenger rushed through the royal palace,"
9597,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Through scenes of noise and uproar, through the city"
9598,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Filling the town with panic: _They are coming_,"
9599,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"He cries, _they are ready for battle, all the Trojans,"
9600,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"All the Etruscans, rank on rank, from Tiber,"
9601,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"All over the plain!_ And the people’s minds are troubled,"
9602,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Their hearts are shaken, their passion and their anger"
9603,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Pricked by no gentle spur. However frightened,"
9604,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"They call for arms, they make impatient gestures,"
9605,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The young men shout, and the old ones moan and mutter;"
9606,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The noise, from every side, goes up to heaven"
9607,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Loud and discordant, the way jays rasp and chatter"
9608,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Or swans along Padusa’s fishy river
9609,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Utter their raucous clamor over the pools.
9610,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And Turnus, seizing on the moment, cries:--"
9611,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"“A fine time, citizens, to call a council,"
9612,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,To sit there praising peace. The enemy
9613,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Is up in arms against us!” That was all,"
9614,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,And he went rushing from the lofty palace.
9615,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"“Volusus, arm the squadrons of the Volscians,"
9616,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Lead the Rutulians forth! Messapus, Coras,"
9617,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Deploy the horsemen over the plains! You others,"
9618,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Some of you, guard the city gates and towers!"
9619,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The rest, be ready to charge where I direct you!”"
9620,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
9621,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"So Turnus gave excited orders: quickly,"
9622,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The rush to the walls was on, all over the city."
9623,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Latinus left the council, sorely troubled"
9624,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"In that sad hour, put off the plan he hoped for,"
9625,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Blaming himself in that he had not welcomed,"
9626,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"More eagerly, his Trojan son Aeneas"
9627,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,For the welfare of the city. And his men
9628,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Were digging trenches, trundling stones, or setting"
9629,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Stakes in the ground, and pitfalls; and the trumpet"
9630,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Sounded for bloody war; and boys and mothers
9631,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Filled in the gaps along the walls. Amata,"
9632,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The queen, with a great throng of matrons, rode"
9633,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,To Pallas’ temple on the heights; beside her
9634,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The girl Lavinia, cause of all that evil,"
9635,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Went with head bowed and downcast eyes. The women
9636,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Climbed on, and made the temple steam with incense,"
9637,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,And from the threshold chanted sorrowful prayers:--
9638,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"“O mighty power in war, Tritonian virgin,"
9639,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Break off his spear, lay low the Trojan robber,"
9640,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Stretch him in death before our lofty portals!”
9641,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
9642,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And Turnus, all impatience, hot for action,"
9643,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Buckles his armor, the ruddy breastplate gleaming"
9644,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Bright with bronze scales, the greaves on fire with gold,"
9645,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The sword snapped to the baldric. Still bareheaded,"
9646,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"A golden blaze, he runs down from the fortress,"
9647,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Exulting in his spirit: he has the foe
9648,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"By the throat already, in imagination."
9649,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"You see that fire when a stallion breaks his tether,"
9650,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Runs from the stable, free at last, a monarch"
9651,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Of all the plain, and makes for the green pastures"
9652,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Where mares are grazing, or splashes into the river"
9653,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Out of sheer joy, and tosses his mane, and nickers,"
9654,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,And the light plays across his neck and shoulders.
9655,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
9656,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"To meet him came Camilla and her Volscians,"
9657,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And she reined in at the gate, dismounting quickly,"
9658,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And all her band, at her example, followed,"
9659,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Listening as she spoke:--“Turnus, if courage"
9660,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Has any right to confidence, I promise,"
9661,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"I dare, to meet the horsemen of Aeneas,"
9662,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"I dare, alone, to face the Etruscan riders."
9663,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Let me try, first, the dangers of the battle;"
9664,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,You stay on guard as captain of the walls.”
9665,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And Turnus, gazing at the warrior-maiden,"
9666,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Replied:--“O glory of Italy, no words"
9667,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Of mine can give you worthy thanks; your spirit
9668,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Surpasses all the rest of them. Share with me
9669,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The work we have to do. Faithless Aeneas,"
9670,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"So rumor says, and scouts confirm, is sending"
9671,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"His cavalry, light-armed, to scour the plains,"
9672,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And he himself, crossing the mountain-ridges,"
9673,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Comes down upon the city. I am planning
9674,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"An ambush for him, where the forest narrows"
9675,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,To shadowy trails; I block both sides of the pass
9676,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"With soldiery in arms. Do you, Camilla,"
9677,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Take on the Etruscan horsemen, act as leader;"
9678,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Messapus, a sharp fighter, will be with you,"
9679,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,And Latin squadrons and the troop from Tibur.”
9680,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Messapus and the other captains listened
9681,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"To orders much like these, and they were heartened,"
9682,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And Turnus left them, moving toward Aeneas."
9683,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
9684,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"There is a valley, winding, curving, fit"
9685,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"For stratagems of warfare, a narrow gorge"
9686,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Black with dense woods on either side; a trail
9687,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Winds through it, narrow and difficult: above it"
9688,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"There lies an unknown plain, a safe position"
9689,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Whether you charge from right or left, or stand there"
9690,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Heaving great boulders down the mountain-shoulders,"
9691,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And Turnus knows this region well, finds cover,"
9692,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Picks the terrain to suit him, waits and watches"
9693,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,In the dark menace of the woods.
9694,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
9695,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And meantime,"
9696,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"High in the halls of heaven, Latona’s daughter"
9697,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Was talking to a nymph of hers, a maiden"
9698,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Of her devoted company, named Opis."
9699,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Diana’s words were sorrowful:--“Camilla
9700,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Is going forth to cruel war, O maiden,"
9701,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Our soldier, all in vain, and dearer to me"
9702,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Than all the other girls; she has loved me long;
9703,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,It is no impulsive whim that moves her spirit.
9704,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Perhaps you know the story--how her father,"
9705,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Metabus, ruler of an ancient city,"
9706,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Became a tyrant, and his people drove him"
9707,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"In hatred from Privernum, and he fled"
9708,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Through war and battles, taking as companion"
9709,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"To share his exile the little infant daughter,"
9710,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Camilla, she was called, after her mother"
9711,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Whose name was not so different, Casmilla."
9712,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"So he was going on, toward ridge and woodland,"
9713,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Long roads to loneliness, holding his daughter"
9714,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Before him on his breast, and weapons flying"
9715,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"From every side against them, and the Volscians"
9716,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Spreading the net of soldiers wide to catch them.
9717,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"But Metabus went on, and came to a river"
9718,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Out of its banks, the swollen Amasenus"
9719,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Foaming in flood from cloudburst. Could he swim it?
9720,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"He thought so, but he checked himself; he feared"
9721,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"For the dear load he carried. He did some thinking,"
9722,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And suddenly, or not quite all of a sudden,"
9723,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,He saw the only way. There was the spear
9724,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"His stout hand bore: it was strong and heavy, knotted"
9725,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Of seasoned oak, and he bound his daughter to it,"
9726,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Gently, with bark of cork-wood all around her,"
9727,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And carefully, to keep the missile’s balance,"
9728,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And let his right hand weigh its heft a little,"
9729,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And then made prayer:--‘O gracious woodland-dweller,"
9730,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Diana, virgin daughter of Latona,"
9731,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,I consecrate my daughter to your service.
9732,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"These are your darts she holds, the very first ones"
9733,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"She ever carried; she comes to you, a suppliant"
9734,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Who flees her foe through pathways of the air.
9735,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Accept her, O dear goddess, I implore you,"
9736,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Make her your own. Her father, I commit her,"
9737,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Now, to the dubious winds.’ The arm drew back,"
9738,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The whirring spear shot forward, and the waters"
9739,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Roared loud below, and over the rush of the river"
9740,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Camilla, on the whistling spear, went flying,"
9741,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And Metabus, as the great host came closer,"
9742,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Dove into the flood, and safe across, a victor"
9743,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And happy, pulled the spear and girl together"
9744,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Out of the grassy turf, his votive offering"
9745,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Made to Latona’s daughter. No city ever
9746,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Received him to its walls or homes; he would not,"
9747,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"In his wild mood, give in to any city."
9748,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"He lived with shepherds on the lonely mountains,"
9749,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And there, where wild beasts lurked, in thorn and thicket"
9750,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,He raised his child; his hands would squeeze the udders
9751,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Of wild mares for their milk. When she could stand
9752,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And toddle a little, he armed her with a javelin,"
9753,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"A tiny pointed lance, and over her shoulder"
9754,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Hung quiver and bow. There were no golden brooches
9755,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"To bind her hair, no trailing gowns: her dress"
9756,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Was black and orange tiger-skin. Her hand
9757,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Grew used to tossing childish darts, or whirling"
9758,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,The limber sling around her head; she learned
9759,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"To hit her targets, crane or snowy swan."
9760,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And as she grew, many a Tuscan mother"
9761,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Wanted her for this son, or that, but vainly:"
9762,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Diana was her goddess, and she cherished,"
9763,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Intact, an everlasting love--her weapons,"
9764,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Her maidenhood, were all she knew and cared for."
9765,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"I wish she had never been so possessed, so ardent"
9766,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"For soldiery like this, attacking Trojans"
9767,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Instead of meeker game; she would have been
9768,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,The one most dear of all my dear companions.
9769,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,But now a bitter doom weighs down upon her.
9770,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Therefore, O nymph, glide down from heaven to Latium,"
9771,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Where, under evil omens, men join battle."
9772,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Take these, my bow, my arrows; from my quiver"
9773,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Draw the avenging shaft. His life is forfeit,"
9774,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Trojan, Italian, whoever he is, whose wound"
9775,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Profanes the sacred body of Camilla.
9776,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And when she has fallen, I will bring her home"
9777,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"By hollow cloud, both warrior and armor"
9778,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Unspoiled, untaken, to her native country,"
9779,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Home to her tomb, poor girl.” And swift through air"
9780,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Opis, on whirring wing, came down from heaven"
9781,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,In the dark whirlwind’s center.
9782,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
9783,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,And the Trojans
9784,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Were drawing near the walls, with Tuscan leaders"
9785,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And all that host of cavalry, whose numbers"
9786,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Filled squadron after squadron, and the horses"
9787,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Snorted and reared and fought the bit and bridle,"
9788,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Light-stepping sideways; far and wide the field
9789,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Bristled with iron harvest, and the plain"
9790,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Burned with the arms raised high. And here against them
9791,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Come Messapus and Coras and his brother,"
9792,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The Latins, moving fast, Camilla’s squadron,"
9793,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The hands drawn back already, and lances flying:"
9794,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,All fire and noise and heat and men and horses.
9795,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"They ride, keep riding, and the distance closes"
9796,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"To spear-cast, and they halt, and a wild clamor"
9797,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Breaks out, the charge is on, they spur the horses"
9798,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Which need no spur, and from all sides they shower"
9799,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The darts as thick as driving snow, the shadow"
9800,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Darkens the sky. Tyrrhenus, wild Aconteus,"
9801,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Single each other out and come together
9802,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Head on, and the spears are broken, and men are thrown,"
9803,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And the horses, smashing their great chests together,"
9804,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Come down with a crash; Aconteus is hurled
9805,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Like a thunderbolt or something from an engine
9806,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Incredibly far off, and dies in the air."
9807,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And the lines waver, and the routed Latins"
9808,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Let fall their shields behind them, head for the city,"
9809,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,With Trojans in pursuit: Asilas leads them.
9810,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"They near the walls, and the Latins turn, and, shouting,"
9811,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Wheel to the charge, and the Trojans break and scatter"
9812,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,With reins let loose. You are looking at the ocean
9813,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The way it comes, one wave, and then another,"
9814,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Surging, receding, flooding, rushing shoreward"
9815,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Over the cliffs in spray and foam or smoothing
9816,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The farthest sand with the shallow curve, withdrawing"
9817,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Faster and faster, and undertow, slowly, slowly"
9818,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Dragging the shingle back, and the surface gliding"
9819,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Sleek from the visible beaches. Twice the Tuscans
9820,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Drove the Rutulians routed to the city;
9821,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Twice, driven back themselves, they slung behind them"
9822,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The shields, reversed, quick-glancing over their shoulders."
9823,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"But when, for the third time, they came together,"
9824,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"They stayed together, locked, all down the line,"
9825,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And each man picked his man, and each man stayed there,"
9826,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,And the rough fight rose and thickened. Dying men
9827,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Groaned, and the blood was deep, and men and armor"
9828,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,And wounded horses and wounded men and bodies
9829,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Of men and horses were in it all together.
9830,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Orsilochus found Remulus a warrior
9831,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Too tough to take head on, and flung his spear"
9832,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"At the head of the horse, instead, and left the iron"
9833,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Under the ear, and the great beast, wounded, rearing,"
9834,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Flailed the air with his forelegs, came down crashing,"
9835,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And the stunned rider, thrown, rolled over and over."
9836,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Catillus killed Iollas, and another,"
9837,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Herminius, giant in body, giant in arms,"
9838,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Giant in spirit, a man who fought bare-headed,"
9839,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Bare-shouldered, a fair-haired man, so huge in stature"
9840,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,He feared no wound. But through his shoulders driven
9841,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The quivering spear made way and bent him double,"
9842,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Writhing in pain. Dark blood flows everywhere,"
9843,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,The sword deals death; men look to wounds for glory.
9844,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
9845,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"In the thick of the fight Camilla rages, wearing"
9846,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Her quiver like an Amazon, one breast"
9847,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Exposed: she showers javelins, she plies"
9848,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,The battle-axe; she never tires; her shoulder
9849,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Clangs with the golden bow, Diana’s weapon."
9850,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"If ever, turning back, she yields, the arrows"
9851,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Are loosed from over her shoulder; even in flight
9852,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"She makes attack. Around her, chosen comrades,"
9853,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Larina, Tulla, and Tarpeia brandish"
9854,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Axes of bronze. She chose them as her handmaids,"
9855,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Good both in peace and war, Italian daughters,"
9856,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Italy’s pride, like Thracian Amazons"
9857,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Warring in colorful armor in the country
9858,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Where Thermodon river runs, and women warriors"
9859,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Hail fighting queens with battle-cries or clash
9860,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,The crescent shields together.
9861,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
9862,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"First and last,"
9863,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Camilla struck men down: who knows how many
9864,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"She brought to earth in death? Clytius’ son,"
9865,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Euneus, faced her first, and her long spear"
9866,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Pierced his unguarded breast. Rivers of blood
9867,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Poured from his mouth; he chewed red dust, and dying"
9868,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Writhed on his wound. She stabbed the horse of Liris,"
9869,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And the rider fell, and reached for the reins: Pagasus"
9870,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Stretched out a hand to help him, to break his fall,"
9871,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,And Camilla slew the pair of them together:
9872,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Amastrus next, Hippotas’ son: far off,"
9873,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Her spear caught up with four, Tereus, Chromis,"
9874,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Harpalycus, Demophoön. For each dart"
9875,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Sent flying from her hand, a Trojan fell."
9876,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Far off she saw the huntsman Ornytus,"
9877,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Riding a native pony, in strange armor."
9878,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"He wore a steer’s hide over his wide shoulders,"
9879,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"A wolf’s head for a helmet, with the jaws,"
9880,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Wide-open, grinning above his head; he carried"
9881,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"A rustic kind of pike, and he was taller,"
9882,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"By a full head, than all the others, easy"
9883,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Target for any dart. She cried above him:--
9884,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"“What did you think, O Tuscan?--You were chasing"
9885,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Beasts in the woods? The day has come when boasting
9886,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Like yours is answered by a woman’s weapons,"
9887,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"But after all, you take to the shades of your fathers"
9888,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,No little cause for pride--Camilla killed you!”
9889,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And then she slew Orsilochus and Butes,"
9890,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Two of the mightiest Trojans, stabbing Butes"
9891,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"With spear-point in the back, between the helmet"
9892,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And breastplate, where the flesh shone white, and shield"
9893,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Hung down from the left arm. Orsilochus
9894,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"She fled from first, and, driven in a circle,"
9895,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Became, in turn, pursuer; and, rising higher,"
9896,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Brought down the battle-axe, again, again,"
9897,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Through armor and through bone: his pleas for mercy
9898,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Availed him nothing; the wound he suffered spattered
9899,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,His face with his warm brains. Next in her way
9900,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,And stunned to halt by abject terror came
9901,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"A son of Aunus, an expert at lying"
9902,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Like all Ligurians. He could not escape her,"
9903,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And knew he could not, but he might outwit her,"
9904,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Or so he hoped. “What’s so courageous, woman"
9905,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Always on horseback? Forget the hope of fleeing,"
9906,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Dismount; meet me on equal terms; try fighting
9907,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"On foot for once. You will learn, I tell you, something,"
9908,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,The disillusion of that windy glory.”
9909,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"She took the challenge, burned with angry temper,"
9910,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Turned her horse over to another, savage"
9911,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"In equal arms, confronting him undaunted,"
9912,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"With naked sword. He leaped into the saddle,"
9913,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Much pleased with his sly stratagem, drove the rowels"
9914,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Deep in the flanks, took off. “O vain Ligurian,"
9915,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Swollen with pride of heart, that slippery cunning"
9916,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Will never get you home to father Aunus!”
9917,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"So cried Camilla, and flashed like fire across"
9918,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The horse’s path, grabbed at the bridle, hauled him"
9919,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,To earth and shed his blood. A hawk in heaven
9920,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Is not more quick to seize a dove when, driving"
9921,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"From the dark rock toward lofty cloud, he fastens"
9922,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The talons deep, and rips, and the feathers flutter,"
9923,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"All blood-stained, down the sky."
9924,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
9925,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,On high Olympus
9926,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Jupiter watched the scene of battle, rousing"
9927,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Tarchon the Etruscan with the spur of anger,"
9928,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,And through the slaughter and the yielding columns
9929,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"That warrior rode, calling each man by name,"
9930,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Driving his ranks to battle with fierce outcry,"
9931,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Rallying beaten men to fight:--“What terror,"
9932,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"O Tuscans, causes you such utter panic?"
9933,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Will nothing ever hurt you? Does a woman
9934,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Chase you all over the field in this confusion?
9935,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Why do we carry swords? What silly weapons
9936,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Are these in our right hands? You are swift enough
9937,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"For wrestling in the night time, or for dances"
9938,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,When the curved flute of Bacchus does the piping!
9939,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"You have, it seems, one pleasure and one passion,"
9940,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Waiting for feasts and goblets on full tables
9941,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,When priests announce the sacrifice propitious
9942,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,And the fat victim calls to the deep woodlands.”
9943,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"So Tarchon had his say, and spurred his charger,"
9944,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Himself not loath to die, fell like a whirlwind"
9945,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"On Venulus, and swept him from the saddle,"
9946,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And lifted him with his right hand, and held him"
9947,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Before him as he rode, and all the Latins"
9948,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Cheered with a noisy din that reached the heaven.
9949,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The arms and man in front of him, over the plain"
9950,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Rode Tarchon, swift as fire; broke off the point"
9951,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Of Venulus’ spear, and sought a place unguarded"
9952,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Where he might thrust a deadly wound; the other
9953,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Struggled against him, kept the hand from the throat,"
9954,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Matched violence with violence. An eagle,"
9955,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Soaring to heaven, carries off a serpent"
9956,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"In just that manner, in the grip of talons,"
9957,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,And the wounded reptile writhes the looping coils
9958,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And rears the scales erect and keeps on hissing,"
9959,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"While the curved beak strikes at the struggling victim,"
9960,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"So, from the battle-line of the Etruscans,"
9961,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Tarchon swept off his struggling prey in triumph,"
9962,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,An inspiration to his rallied people.
9963,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
9964,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Then Arruns, as the fates would have it, started"
9965,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Stalking the fleet Camilla with the javelin,"
9966,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Ahead of her in cunning. He took no chances,"
9967,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Seeking the easiest way. When that wild maiden
9968,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Dashed fiercely into the battle, there he followed"
9969,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Stealthily in her footsteps, or turned the reins"
9970,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"When she came back victorious. This way, that way,"
9971,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Wary in each approach, he circled after,"
9972,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,The sure spear quivering as he poised and held it.
9973,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"It happened Chloreus, Cybele’s priest, was shining"
9974,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Far off in Phrygian armor, spurring a horse"
9975,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Covered with leather, scales of brass and gold"
9976,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And the rider was a fire of foreign color,"
9977,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Launching his Cretan darts: the bow was golden,"
9978,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The helmet golden, and the cloak of saffron,"
9979,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"So stiff it had a metal sound, was fastened"
9980,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,With knots of yellow gold; some foreign needle
9981,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Had worked embroidery into hose and tunic.
9982,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Camilla picked him out from all the battle,"
9983,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Either to take that spoil home to the temple,"
9984,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Or flaunt the gold herself; she was a huntress
9985,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"In blind pursuit, dazzled by spoil, a woman"
9986,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Reckless for finery. In hiding, Arruns"
9987,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Caught up his spear and prayed:--“Most high Apollo,"
9988,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Soracte’s warden, whose adorers feed"
9989,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The pine-wood fire, and trustful tread the embers,"
9990,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Let me wipe out this shame. I seek no plunder,"
9991,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"No spoil, no trophy, of Camilla beaten;"
9992,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,I may perhaps find other ways to glory.
9993,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,All I ask here is that this scourge may vanish
9994,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Under a wound I give; for this I am willing
9995,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"To make return, however inglorious, home.”"
9996,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Half of his prayer was heard: Apollo granted
9997,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,The downfall of Camilla; the returning
9998,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Safe home was not to be,--the south winds carried"
9999,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"That much to empty air. So the spear, whirring,"
10000,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Spun from his hand; the sound turned all the Volscians
10001,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,With anxious eyes and minds to watch their ruler.
10002,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"She heard no stir in the air, no sound, no weapon"
10003,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Along the sky, till the spear went to its lodging"
10004,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,In the bare breast and drank the maiden blood.
10005,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Her frightened comrades hurry, catch her falling,"
10006,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And Arruns, frightened more than any other,"
10007,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Half joy, half fear, makes off: no further daring"
10008,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Is his, to trust the lance or face encounter."
10009,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,As a wolf that kills a bullock or a shepherd
10010,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Before the darts can reach him, down the mountains"
10011,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Goes plunging through the brush, the sign of guilt"
10012,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"His tail clapped under the belly, bent on flight,"
10013,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,So Arruns sneaks to cover through the armies.
10014,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Dying, she pulls at the dart, but the point is fast,"
10015,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Deep in the wound between the ribs; her eyes
10016,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Roll, cold in death; her color pales; her breath"
10017,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Comes hard. She calls to Acca, her companion,"
10018,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Most loved, most loyal:--“I have managed, Acca,"
10019,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"This far, but now--the bitter wound--I am done for,"
10020,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,There are shadows all around. Hurry to Turnus.
10021,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Take him this last direction, to relieve me"
10022,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Here in the fight, defend the town, keep off--"
10023,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Farewell!” The reins went slack, the earth received her"
10024,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Yielding her body to its cold, resigning"
10025,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The sagging head to death; and she let fall,"
10026,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"For the last time, her weapons, and the spirit"
10027,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Went with a moan indignant to the shadows.
10028,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,And then indeed the golden stars were smitten
10029,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"By a wild outcry; with Camilla fallen,"
10030,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,The fight takes on new fierceness: all the Trojans
10031,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Rush in, Etruscan leaders, all the squadrons"
10032,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"That came, once, from Evander."
10033,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
10034,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,High in the mountains
10035,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Opis, Diana’s sentinel, unfrightened,"
10036,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Had watched the battle, and seen, through all that fury,"
10037,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Camilla slain in pitiful death. She sighed
10038,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And spoke with deep emotion:--“Cruel, cruel,"
10039,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The punishment you pay, poor warrior-maiden,"
10040,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,For that attempt to battle down the Trojans!
10041,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"It comes to nothing, all the lonely service"
10042,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"In woodland thicket, the worship of Diana,"
10043,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,The wearing of our arrows on the shoulder.
10044,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And even so, in the last hour of dying,"
10045,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Your queen has not forsaken you, nor left you"
10046,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Unhonored altogether; through the nations
10047,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"This will be known, your death, and with it, surely,"
10048,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,The satisfaction of vengeance. He whose wound
10049,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Profaned your body will die as he deserves to.”
10050,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Under the lofty mountain stood the tomb
10051,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Of an old king, Dercennus of Laurentum,"
10052,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,A mound of earth under a holm-oak’s shadow.
10053,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Here first the lovely goddess, sweeping down"
10054,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"From heaven, paused, and from that height watched Arruns,"
10055,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And saw him puffed with pride, exulting vainly,"
10056,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,And called:--“Why go so far away? Come nearer!
10057,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Come to the death you merit; for Camilla
10058,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Receive the due reward. Shall you die also
10059,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Under Diana’s weapons?” She drew an arrow
10060,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Swift from the quiver of gold, drew back the bow"
10061,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Till the curved ends were meeting, and her hands"
10062,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Were even, left at arrow-tip and right"
10063,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Brushing her breast as she let loose the bow-string.
10064,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And as he heard the twang and the air whirring,"
10065,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"He felt the steel strike home. Gasping and moaning,"
10066,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,He lay there in the unknown dust; his comrades
10067,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Forgot, and left him where he lay, and Opis"
10068,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Soared upward to Olympus.
10069,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
10070,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Camilla’s squadron
10071,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Was first to flee, their leader lost; Atinas,"
10072,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Keen though he was, sped off; in reel and rout"
10073,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Rutulians followed; captains and troops uncaptained,"
10074,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Shattered and broken, turned and wheeled their horses"
10075,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,On a gallop toward the walls. No one can halt
10076,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The Trojans now, nor stand against the havoc;"
10077,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"They carry unstrung bows on nerveless shoulders,"
10078,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,And the horses drum in the rush in the dust of the plain.
10079,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"A cloud of dust, black murk, rolls toward the walls,"
10080,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And from the watch-towers mothers wail to heaven,"
10081,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Beating their breasts, screaming in lamentation."
10082,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,The first ones stumble through the gates; upon them
10083,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The enemy presses hard, and friend and foe"
10084,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Are all confused together. Men are dying,"
10085,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Gasping away their lives on their own threshold,"
10086,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"In sight of home and shelter, unprotected"
10087,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Within their native walls. Some close the gates,"
10088,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Dare not admit their wretched comrades, pleading,"
10089,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Nor take them to the town. And slaughter follows,"
10090,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Most pitiful: the sword that guards the portals
10091,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Kills citizens who try to rush in blindly.
10092,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Their parents, weeping, see them shut from the city,"
10093,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And some, who are driven back, go rolling headlong"
10094,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Into the trenches, and others, dashing wildly"
10095,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"With loosened rein, crash into gates and portals"
10096,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Locked tight against them. Along the walls the mothers
10097,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Try to be fighters (love of country taught them)
10098,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And, as they saw Camilla do, fling weapons"
10099,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"With trembling hands, or grasp at stakes or oak-poles"
10100,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"To do the work that steel should do, poor creatures,"
10101,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Eager to die, before the walls, in the vanguard."
10102,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,
10103,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Meanwhile, to Turnus in his forest ambush"
10104,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The terrible news is borne: Acca reports it,"
10105,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The Volscian ranks destroyed, Camilla fallen,"
10106,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The enemy, deadly, massing thick, and sweeping"
10107,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"All things before them in triumphant warfare,"
10108,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Fear at the very walls. And Turnus, raging--"
10109,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,(As Jupiter’s relentless will commanded)
10110,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Forsook the ambush in the hills, abandoned"
10111,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"The rugged woodland, and scarcely had he done so,"
10112,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Passing from sight to valley, when Aeneas"
10113,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Entered the pass in safety, crossed the mountain,"
10114,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Came out of the dark woods. And both were striving
10115,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"To reach the city, swiftly, in full column"
10116,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,And almost side by side: in a single moment
10117,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Aeneas saw the plain and the dust rising
10118,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"And Turnus saw Aeneas, fierce for battle,"

10120,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"There was almost time for fighting, but the Sun-god,"
10121,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"Colored in crimson, brought his weary horses"
10122,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,"To bathe in the Western ocean; day was over,"
10123,THE DESPAIR OF THE LATINS,Night coming on. They camped before the city.

10131,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10132,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10133,THE FINAL COMBAT,"As Turnus saw the Latins failing, broken,"
10134,THE FINAL COMBAT,"With Mars against them, and all eyes upon him"
10135,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Awaiting the fulfillment of his promise,"
10136,THE FINAL COMBAT,"He burned with wrath, implacable, and lifted"
10137,THE FINAL COMBAT,"His spirit high, as in the fields of Carthage"
10138,THE FINAL COMBAT,"A lion, sorely wounded by the hunters,"
10139,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Fights harder for the hurt, the happier for it."
10140,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And the mane rises on the neck and shoulders,"
10141,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And the jaws break off the weapon, and the bloody mouth"
10142,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Roars out defiance, even so in Turnus"
10143,THE FINAL COMBAT,The violent spirit raged. He spoke to the king
10144,THE FINAL COMBAT,In angry words:--“Turnus won’t keep them waiting;
10145,THE FINAL COMBAT,No reason for these cowards to renounce
10146,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Their bargain. Start the holy ritual, father,"
10147,THE FINAL COMBAT,Arrange the terms. I go to meet the Trojan;
10148,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Let the Latins sit and watch it if they want to,"
10149,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And this right arm will send him down to Hell,"
10150,THE FINAL COMBAT,The renegade from Asia. I alone
10151,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Answer the argument that calls us cowards,"
10152,THE FINAL COMBAT,"I, with one single sword. Or we are beaten"
10153,THE FINAL COMBAT,And he takes Lavinia home.”
10154,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10155,THE FINAL COMBAT,Latinus answered
10156,THE FINAL COMBAT,"With quiet in his heart:--“O youth, distinguished"
10157,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Above them all in spirit, the more your courage"
10158,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Rises to fierceness, the more I find it needful"
10159,THE FINAL COMBAT,"To take slow counsel, to balance every hazard."
10160,THE FINAL COMBAT,"You have the kingdom of your father Daunus,"
10161,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And many a captured town; and I, Latinus,"
10162,THE FINAL COMBAT,Lack neither gold nor spirit. In our country
10163,THE FINAL COMBAT,"There are other girls, unwed, and not ignoble."
10164,THE FINAL COMBAT,Let me say this--I know it is not easy--
10165,THE FINAL COMBAT,"As frankly as I can, and listen to me:"
10166,THE FINAL COMBAT,It was not right for me to give my daughter
10167,THE FINAL COMBAT,"To any of her former native suitors,"
10168,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And gods and men so prophesied. I loved you,"
10169,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Turnus, and I gave in: we are related"
10170,THE FINAL COMBAT,"By blood, I know, and when Amata sorrowed,"
10171,THE FINAL COMBAT,"I broke off every bond, cancelled the promise,"
10172,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Took up unholy arms. From that day, Turnus,"
10173,THE FINAL COMBAT,"You see what wars pursue me, and what dangers,"
10174,THE FINAL COMBAT,"What sufferings you, above all men, submit to."
10175,THE FINAL COMBAT,We have been beaten twice in a great battle
10176,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And now we hold, just barely, in our city"
10177,THE FINAL COMBAT,The hopes of Italy. The streams of Tiber
10178,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Are warm with blood of ours, and the broad fields"
10179,THE FINAL COMBAT,White with our bones. In what direction
10180,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Do I keep turning, back and forth? What madness"
10181,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Changes my purpose? If, with Turnus dead,"
10182,THE FINAL COMBAT,"I stand prepared to join them to me as allies,"
10183,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Why not, while he still lives, break off the conflict?"
10184,THE FINAL COMBAT,"What will they say, all your Rutulian kinsmen,"
10185,THE FINAL COMBAT,"All Italy, if I (may fortune keep"
10186,THE FINAL COMBAT,The word I say from coming true!) betray you
10187,THE FINAL COMBAT,"To death, the suitor of my only daughter?"
10188,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Consider war’s uncertainties, and pity"
10189,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Your aged father, far from us and grieving"
10190,THE FINAL COMBAT,"In Ardea, his homeland.” The king’s appeal"
10191,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Moved Turnus not at all; his temper worsened,"
10192,THE FINAL COMBAT,Was aggravated by the attempt at healing.
10193,THE FINAL COMBAT,"He managed, with an effort, to say something:--"
10194,THE FINAL COMBAT,"“Most kindly father, the care you have for me"
10195,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Lay down, for my sake; let me have permission"
10196,THE FINAL COMBAT,"To trade death for renown. I too, dear father,"
10197,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Toss no mean dart, swing no mean sword, and blood"
10198,THE FINAL COMBAT,Follows the wounds I give. His goddess-mother
10199,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Will not be there, this time, to hide him, running"
10200,THE FINAL COMBAT,To the folds of her gown and cloud and empty shadows.”
10201,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10202,THE FINAL COMBAT,"But Queen Amata, sick and almost dying"
10203,THE FINAL COMBAT,"From fear of the new battle-chance, was weeping;"
10204,THE FINAL COMBAT,He was the son she wanted; she would not let him
10205,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Risk that heroic life, and, clinging to him,"
10206,THE FINAL COMBAT,"She made her plea:--“Turnus, our only hope,"
10207,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Our only comfort in our sad old age,"
10208,THE FINAL COMBAT,The pride and honor of Latinus’ kingdom
10209,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Rest in your keeping, and our sinking house"
10210,THE FINAL COMBAT,Depends on you to shore it up from ruin.
10211,THE FINAL COMBAT,"If tears of mine can move you, if my daughter"
10212,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Merits the least devotion, I implore you,"
10213,THE FINAL COMBAT,I beg one favor: do not fight the Trojan!
10214,THE FINAL COMBAT,Whatever danger waits you in that duel
10215,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Awaits me also, Turnus; I shall leave"
10216,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The hateful light when you do, I shall never"
10217,THE FINAL COMBAT,Be such a captive as to see Aeneas
10218,THE FINAL COMBAT,Come to my home as son-in-law.” Lavinia
10219,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Listened and wept and blushed, her maiden features"
10220,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Suffused with color, as the stain of crimson"
10221,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Adds hue to Indian ivory, or lilies"
10222,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Lose something of their whiteness, mixed with roses."
10223,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And Turnus, troubled enough, was troubled further"
10224,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Watching the girl, and burned the more for battle,"
10225,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And spoke, however briefly, to Amata:--"
10226,THE FINAL COMBAT,"“Do not, O mother, follow me with tears"
10227,THE FINAL COMBAT,Or any such omen as I go to battle.
10228,THE FINAL COMBAT,Turnus can not delay his death.” He turned
10229,THE FINAL COMBAT,"To Idmon, then, and told him:--“Be my herald:"
10230,THE FINAL COMBAT,Deliver to that Phrygian usurper
10231,THE FINAL COMBAT,These words from me--I know that he will hate them--
10232,THE FINAL COMBAT,"When dawn to-morrow, riding in the heaven"
10233,THE FINAL COMBAT,"In crimson chariot, glows and reddens, let him"
10234,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Hold back his Trojans, let their weapons and ours"
10235,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Have rest, let us end the war, two of us only;"
10236,THE FINAL COMBAT,"There let Lavinia be sought, her husband"
10237,THE FINAL COMBAT,The victor on that field!”
10238,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10239,THE FINAL COMBAT,And he went home
10240,THE FINAL COMBAT,"To his own quarters, hurrying, demanding"
10241,THE FINAL COMBAT,"His horses, given Pilumnus by Orithyia,"
10242,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Whiter than snow, swifter than wind. And he was happy"
10243,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Looking at them, all spirit, as they nickered"
10244,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Seeing their master. The drivers stood about them,"
10245,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Grooming the manes, patting the chests. And Turnus"
10246,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Fits to his shoulders the stiff coat of armor,"
10247,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The gold, the bronze, and tests the readiness"
10248,THE FINAL COMBAT,Of sword and shield and the horns of the ruddy crest
10249,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Vulcan had made the sword for Daunus, metal"
10250,THE FINAL COMBAT,Glowing white-hot and plunged in Stygian water.
10251,THE FINAL COMBAT,The spear stood leaning on a mighty pillar
10252,THE FINAL COMBAT,"In the great hall, a trophy won from Actor;"
10253,THE FINAL COMBAT,"He seized it poised it, shook it, cried aloud:--"
10254,THE FINAL COMBAT,"“Be with me now, good spear that never failed me!"
10255,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The time has come. Let me lay low that body,"
10256,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Let my tough hands rip off his coat of armor,"
10257,THE FINAL COMBAT,Let me shove that eunuch’s crimped and perfumed tresses
10258,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Deep in the dust!” So he was driven by fury,"
10259,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Sparks leaping from his countenance, and fire"
10260,THE FINAL COMBAT,Flashing at every glance; he is like a bull
10261,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Bellowing before battle, charging tree-trunks"
10262,THE FINAL COMBAT,"To get the anger into his horns, head lowered"
10263,THE FINAL COMBAT,"As if to gore the winds, and pawing sand."
10264,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And in the other camp Aeneas, likewise,"
10265,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Fierce in the arms his mother brought from Vulcan,"
10266,THE FINAL COMBAT,Sharpens his fighting spirit and rejoices
10267,THE FINAL COMBAT,That the war’s end is near through this agreement.
10268,THE FINAL COMBAT,"He comforts comrades, reassures Iulus,"
10269,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Sad in his fear, tells them the fates, and orders"
10270,THE FINAL COMBAT,Definite answer brought to King Latinus
10271,THE FINAL COMBAT,With proper terms of armistice.
10272,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10273,THE FINAL COMBAT,And dawn
10274,THE FINAL COMBAT,Had scarcely touched the mountain-tops with light
10275,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And the Sun-god’s horses risen from the ocean,"
10276,THE FINAL COMBAT,When Trojans and Rutulians left the city
10277,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And came to the great plain, the field of combat,"
10278,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Under the walls, and in the midst erected"
10279,THE FINAL COMBAT,The hearths and altars for their common gods.
10280,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Others, their temples bound with holy vervain,"
10281,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Veiled with the sacred robes, brought fire and water."
10282,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Through the full gates the Ausonian host came streaming,"
10283,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And from the other side, Trojans, Etruscans,"
10284,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Harnessed in steel, as if a battle called them,"
10285,THE FINAL COMBAT,"With leaders flashing there, amid their thousands,"
10286,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Brilliant in gold and purple, brave Asilas,"
10287,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Mnestheus, Assaracus’ high-souled descendant,"
10288,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Messapus, tamer of horses, son of Neptune."
10289,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Each, at a signal, found his post; the spears"
10290,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Were fixed in the earth, and the shields rested on them."
10291,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Then came the mothers in their eagerness,"
10292,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And the unarmed throng, and the weak old men, all crowding"
10293,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Towers and house-tops, or standing by the portals."
10294,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10295,THE FINAL COMBAT,"But Juno, from the summit now called Alban,"
10296,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Nameless in those days, lacking fame and glory,"
10297,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Looked over the plain, the lines of Latin and Trojan,"
10298,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The city of Latinus, and she turned,"
10299,THE FINAL COMBAT,"A goddess to a goddess, to Juturna,"
10300,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Sister of Turnus, guardian of still pools"
10301,THE FINAL COMBAT,And sounding rivers; Jupiter had given
10302,THE FINAL COMBAT,"This honor to her, for the honor taken,"
10303,THE FINAL COMBAT,The lost virginity. Juno addressed her:--
10304,THE FINAL COMBAT,"“O glory of the rivers, dear Juturna,"
10305,THE FINAL COMBAT,You know you are the only one I have favored
10306,THE FINAL COMBAT,Of all the Latin girls who have made their way
10307,THE FINAL COMBAT,"To great-souled Jove’s ungrateful couch; I gave you,"
10308,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Gladly, a place in Heaven; learn, Juturna,"
10309,THE FINAL COMBAT,A sorrow of yours; do not reproach me for it.
10310,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Where fortune seemed to grant it, and the Fates"
10311,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Let things go well for Latium, I protected"
10312,THE FINAL COMBAT,Your brother and your city. Now I see him
10313,THE FINAL COMBAT,Faced with unequal destiny. The day
10314,THE FINAL COMBAT,Of doom and enemy violence draws near.
10315,THE FINAL COMBAT,I cannot watch this battle and this treaty;
10316,THE FINAL COMBAT,"You, it may be, have in you greater daring,"
10317,THE FINAL COMBAT,Resourceful for your brother’s sake. Go on;
10318,THE FINAL COMBAT,That much is only decent. Happier fortunes
10319,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Will follow the unfortunate, if only--”"
10320,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10321,THE FINAL COMBAT,"As she broke off, Juturna wept; her hand"
10322,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Struck thrice, four times, her lovely breast. And Juno"
10323,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Cried:--“This is not the time for tears, Juturna!"
10324,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Hurry; and if there is some way to save him,"
10325,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Snatch him from death; or stir up war, break off"
10326,THE FINAL COMBAT,The covenant: be daring--you are granted
10327,THE FINAL COMBAT,Authority from Juno!” And she left her
10328,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Doubtful and suffering, with wounded spirit."
10329,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10330,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Meanwhile, the kings were riding forth, Latinus"
10331,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Imposing in his four-horse car, his forehead"
10332,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Gleaming with twelve gold rays of light, the symbol"
10333,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Of his ancestral Sun, and Turnus coming"
10334,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Behind a snow-white team, and Turnus’ hand"
10335,THE FINAL COMBAT,Brandishing spears with two broad heads of steel.
10336,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And on this side, burning with starry shield"
10337,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And arms from Heaven, came Aeneas, father"
10338,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Of Rome to be, and from the camp Iulus,"
10339,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The second hope of Roman greatness, followed."
10340,THE FINAL COMBAT,"In robes immaculate, the priest was waiting"
10341,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Beside the blazing altars, swine and oxen"
10342,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And sheep, unshorn, ready for sacrifice,"
10343,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And the leaders faced the rising sun, and sprinkled"
10344,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The salted meal, and marked the victims’ foreheads"
10345,THE FINAL COMBAT,"With knives that took the holy lock, and poured"
10346,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Libations on the altars, and Aeneas,"
10347,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Drawing his sword, made prayer:--“Sun, be my witness,"
10348,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And Earth be witness to me in my praying,"
10349,THE FINAL COMBAT,"This Earth, for whom I have been able to bear"
10350,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Such toil and suffering, Almighty Father,"
10351,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Queen Juno, now, I pray, a kinder goddess,"
10352,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Be witness, and Mars, renownèd god of battles,"
10353,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Rivers and Fountains, too, I call, and Powers"
10354,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Of lofty Heaven and deep blue ocean, witness:"
10355,THE FINAL COMBAT,"If victory comes to Turnus, the Trojans, beaten,"
10356,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Go to Evander’s city, and Iulus"
10357,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Will quit these lands forever, and hereafter"
10358,THE FINAL COMBAT,No son or follower of Aeneas ever
10359,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Will rise again in warfare, or with sword"
10360,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Attack these kingdoms. But if Victory grants us,"
10361,THE FINAL COMBAT,"As I expect, and may the gods confirm it,"
10362,THE FINAL COMBAT,"To win the battle, I will not have Italians"
10363,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Be subject to the Trojans; I crave no kingdom,"
10364,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Not for myself: let both, unbeaten nations,"
10365,THE FINAL COMBAT,On equal terms enter eternal concord.
10366,THE FINAL COMBAT,I will establish gods and ceremonial;
10367,THE FINAL COMBAT,"My sire, Latinus, keep his arms, his sceptre."
10368,THE FINAL COMBAT,The Trojans will build walls for me; Lavinia
10369,THE FINAL COMBAT,Shall give the city her name.”
10370,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10371,THE FINAL COMBAT,And so Aeneas
10372,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Made solemn pledge, and after him Latinus,"
10373,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Lifting his eyes to heaven, and outstretching"
10374,THE FINAL COMBAT,"His right hand to the stars, confirmed the treaty:--"
10375,THE FINAL COMBAT,"“By these same Powers I swear, Aeneas, by Earth,"
10376,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Sea, Stars, Latona’s offspring, two-faced Janus,"
10377,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The power of the world below, and Pluto’s altars;"
10378,THE FINAL COMBAT,"May the Almighty Father, who sanctions treaties"
10379,THE FINAL COMBAT,"With lightning, hear my words: I touch the altars,"
10380,THE FINAL COMBAT,I call these fires and presences to witness:
10381,THE FINAL COMBAT,"No day shall break this peace, this pact, Italians,"
10382,THE FINAL COMBAT,However things befall; no force shall turn me
10383,THE FINAL COMBAT,"From this intention, not if the force of deluge"
10384,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Confounded land and water, Heaven and Hell."
10385,THE FINAL COMBAT,Even as this sceptre” (and he gestured with it)
10386,THE FINAL COMBAT,"“Shall never bloom with leaf in branch or shadow,"
10387,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Once it has left its forest-trunk, its mother,"
10388,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And lost to steel its foliage, a tree"
10389,THE FINAL COMBAT,"No more, when once the artist’s hand has edged it"
10390,THE FINAL COMBAT,"With proper bronze, for Latin sires to carry.”"
10391,THE FINAL COMBAT,"So they affirmed the covenant, in sight"
10392,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Of leaders and people, and duly, over the flame,"
10393,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Made sacrifice of victims, and tore out"
10394,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The entrails while the beasts yet lived, and loaded"
10395,THE FINAL COMBAT,The altars high with offerings.
10396,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10397,THE FINAL COMBAT,But more and more
10398,THE FINAL COMBAT,Rutulian hearts were wavering; the fight
10399,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Began to seem unequal, and they stirred,"
10400,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Shifted and doubted. And Turnus moved them strangely,"
10401,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Coming on silent footstep to the altar,"
10402,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Looking down humbly, with a meek devotion,"
10403,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Cheeks drawn and pale. Juturna heard the whispers,"
10404,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The muttered talk, and sensed the stir in the crowd,"
10405,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And suddenly plunged into their midst, disguised"
10406,THE FINAL COMBAT,"As Camers, noble in birth and brave in arms, and son"
10407,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Of a brave father. She knew what she was doing,"
10408,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Putting the fuel of rumor on the fire,"
10409,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And crying:--“Are you not ashamed, Rutulians,"
10410,THE FINAL COMBAT,That one should be exposed for all this army?
10411,THE FINAL COMBAT,"In strength, in numbers, are we not their equal?"
10412,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Here they all are, the Trojans, the Arcadians,"
10413,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The Etruscans, all the lot of them: and we"
10414,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Are almost twice as many; man to man,"
10415,THE FINAL COMBAT,Two against one! But no: we are willing to let him
10416,THE FINAL COMBAT,Rise to the skies on deathless praise; the gods
10417,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Receive him, by his own decision bound,"
10418,THE FINAL COMBAT,"An offering at their altars, and we sit here"
10419,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Sluggish as stone on ground, our country lost,"
10420,THE FINAL COMBAT,Ready to bow to any arrogant master.”
10421,THE FINAL COMBAT,"They are moved; at least the young are, and a murmur"
10422,THE FINAL COMBAT,Runs through the ranks: the Latins and Laurentians
10423,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Are ripe for change. Rest from the war, and safety"
10424,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Count less than arms. They want the treaty broken,"
10425,THE FINAL COMBAT,"They pity Turnus. It’s not fair, this bargain."
10426,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And now Juturna adds a greater warning,"
10427,THE FINAL COMBAT,"A sign from heaven, and nothing could have stirred them"
10428,THE FINAL COMBAT,With more immediate impetus to folly.
10429,THE FINAL COMBAT,"For, flying through the sky, an eagle, orange"
10430,THE FINAL COMBAT,"In the red light, was bearing down, pursuing"
10431,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The birds along the shore, and they were noisy"
10432,THE FINAL COMBAT,"In desperate flight, and the eagle struck, and the talons"
10433,THE FINAL COMBAT,Seized the conspicuous swan. And as the Italians
10434,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Looked up in fascination, all the birds,"
10435,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Most wonderful to tell, wheeled, and their outcry"
10436,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Clanged, and their wings were a dark cloud in heaven,"
10437,THE FINAL COMBAT,"A cloud that drove their enemy before them,"
10438,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Till, beaten down by force, by weight, the eagle"
10439,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Faltered, let go the prey, which fell to the river"
10440,THE FINAL COMBAT,As the great bird flew far to the distant clouds.
10441,THE FINAL COMBAT,"This omen the Rutulians cheered with shouting,"
10442,THE FINAL COMBAT,"With hands that cry for action. And their augur,"
10443,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Tolumnius, roused them further:--“I have prayed"
10444,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Often for this, and here it is! I own it,"
10445,THE FINAL COMBAT,"I recognize the gods. With me as leader,"
10446,THE FINAL COMBAT,"With me, I say, take arms, unhappy people,"
10447,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Whom, like frail birds, the insolent marauder"
10448,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Frightens in war, despoils your shores. He also"
10449,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Will take to flight, far to the distant oceans."
10450,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Combine, come massing on, defend in battle"
10451,THE FINAL COMBAT,The king snatched from you!”
10452,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10453,THE FINAL COMBAT,"He went rushing forward,"
10454,THE FINAL COMBAT,Let fly his spear: the whistling shaft of cornel
10455,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Sang its determined way through air, and with it"
10456,THE FINAL COMBAT,"A mighty shout arose, formations broken,"
10457,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Hearts hot for battle, as the spear went flying."
10458,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Nine handsome brothers, their mother a Tuscan woman,"
10459,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Good wife to the Arcadian Gylippus,"
10460,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Stood in its path, and one of them, distinguished"
10461,THE FINAL COMBAT,"In looks and gleaming armor, fell; the spear-point"
10462,THE FINAL COMBAT,Struck where the belt was buckled over the belly
10463,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And went on through the ribs. The brothers, angry,"
10464,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Grieving, drew swords, or picked up spears in frenzy,"
10465,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Went blindly rushing in, and the Latin columns"
10466,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Came charging at them; from their side the Trojans,"
10467,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Men from Agylla, brightly-armed Arcadians,"
10468,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Poured in a rushing flood. One passion held them,--"
10469,THE FINAL COMBAT,"_Decide it with the sword!_ They strip the altars,"
10470,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The sky is dark, it seems, with a storm of weapons,"
10471,THE FINAL COMBAT,The iron rain is a deluge. Bowls and hearth-fires
10472,THE FINAL COMBAT,Are carried off; Latinus flees: the gods
10473,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Are beaten, the treaty ruined by corruption."
10474,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Other men rein their chariots, leap on horses,"
10475,THE FINAL COMBAT,Come with drawn swords.
10476,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10477,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Messapus, most eager"
10478,THE FINAL COMBAT,"To break the truce, rides down a king, Aulestes,"
10479,THE FINAL COMBAT,Wearing the emblem of a Tuscan monarch.
10480,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Staggering backward from that charge, and reeling,"
10481,THE FINAL COMBAT,"He falls upon the altars, there behind him,"
10482,THE FINAL COMBAT,Comes down on head and shoulders. And like fire
10483,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Messapus flashes toward him, spear in hand,"
10484,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And, from the horse, strikes heavily down; the spear"
10485,THE FINAL COMBAT,Is like a plunging beam. For all his pleading
10486,THE FINAL COMBAT,Aulestes hears no more than this:--“He has it!
10487,THE FINAL COMBAT,Here is a better victim for the altars!”
10488,THE FINAL COMBAT,His limbs are warm as the Italians rob them.
10489,THE FINAL COMBAT,Ebysus aims a blow at Corynaeus
10490,THE FINAL COMBAT,Who snatches up a firebrand from the altar
10491,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And thrusts it in his face, and his beard blazes"
10492,THE FINAL COMBAT,"With a smell of fire. And Corynaeus follows,"
10493,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Clutches the hair with the left hand, and grounds him"
10494,THE FINAL COMBAT,With knee-thrust; the relentless steel goes home.
10495,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And Podalirius, sword in hand, looms over"
10496,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The shepherd Alsus, rushing through the weapons"
10497,THE FINAL COMBAT,"In the front line, but Alsus, arm drawn back,"
10498,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Swings the axe forward, cleaving chin and forehead,"
10499,THE FINAL COMBAT,Drenching the armor with blood. An iron slumber
10500,THE FINAL COMBAT,Seals Podalirius’ eyes; they close forever
10501,THE FINAL COMBAT,In everlasting night.
10502,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10503,THE FINAL COMBAT,"But good Aeneas,"
10504,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Head bare, holds out his hand, unarmed, calls loudly"
10505,THE FINAL COMBAT,In hope to check his men:--“Where are you rushing?
10506,THE FINAL COMBAT,What sudden brawl is rising? Control your anger!
10507,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The treaty is made, and all the terms agreed on,"
10508,THE FINAL COMBAT,The fight my right alone. Let me take over;
10509,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Lay down your fear: this hand will prove the treaty,"
10510,THE FINAL COMBAT,Making it sure. These rites owe Turnus to me.”
10511,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And even as he cried, an arrow flew"
10512,THE FINAL COMBAT,Winging against him; no one knew the hand
10513,THE FINAL COMBAT,That turned it loose with whirlwind force; if man
10514,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Or god, nobody knew; and no man boasted"
10515,THE FINAL COMBAT,Of having been the one to wound Aeneas.
10516,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10517,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And Turnus saw him leave the field, and captains"
10518,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And ranks confused, and burned with sudden spirit."
10519,THE FINAL COMBAT,"He is hopeful now; he calls for arms, for horses,"
10520,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Leaps proudly into his chariot, plies the reins,"
10521,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Drives fiercely, gives to death many brave heroes,"
10522,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Rolls many, half alive, under the wheels,"
10523,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Crushes the columns under his car, and showers"
10524,THE FINAL COMBAT,Spear after spear at men who try to flee him.
10525,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Even as Mars, along the icy Hebrus,"
10526,THE FINAL COMBAT,In blood-red fury thunders with his shield
10527,THE FINAL COMBAT,And rousing war gives rein to his wild horses
10528,THE FINAL COMBAT,Faster than winds over the open plain
10529,THE FINAL COMBAT,"As Thrace groans under their gallop, and around him"
10530,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Black Terror’s forms are driven, and Rage, and Ambush,"
10531,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Attendants on the god,--with equal frenzy"
10532,THE FINAL COMBAT,"So Turnus rages through the midst of battle,"
10533,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Lashing the steeds that steam with sweat, and killing"
10534,THE FINAL COMBAT,And riding down the slain; the swift hooves spatter
10535,THE FINAL COMBAT,A bloody dew and the sand they pound is bloody.
10536,THE FINAL COMBAT,"He has given Sthenelus to death, and Pholus,"
10537,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And Thamyrus, by spear or sword, close in,"
10538,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Far off, no matter; Glaucus also, Lades,"
10539,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Imbrasus’ sons, from Lycia, where their father"
10540,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Reared them and gave them either kind of armor,"
10541,THE FINAL COMBAT,"For fighting hand to hand, on foot, or mounted"
10542,THE FINAL COMBAT,On chargers swift as wind.
10543,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10544,THE FINAL COMBAT,Elsewhere Eumedes
10545,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Comes riding to the battle, son of Dolon,"
10546,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Named after Dolon’s father, and in daring"
10547,THE FINAL COMBAT,"True son of Dolon, who claimed Achilles’ chariot"
10548,THE FINAL COMBAT,"For spying on the Grecian camp, and went there"
10549,THE FINAL COMBAT,And Diomedes paid him for his daring
10550,THE FINAL COMBAT,"With somewhat different tokens, so that Dolon"
10551,THE FINAL COMBAT,No longer craved the horses of Achilles.
10552,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And Turnus saw that son of his, Eumedes,"
10553,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Far on the open plain, and overtook him"
10554,THE FINAL COMBAT,"With the light javelin, through long emptiness,"
10555,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And stopped his horses, and leaped down, and landed"
10556,THE FINAL COMBAT,"On a man fallen, half-alive, and stood there,"
10557,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Foot on Eumedes’ neck, twisted the sword"
10558,THE FINAL COMBAT,"From Eumedes’ right hand, and changed its silver"
10559,THE FINAL COMBAT,"To red, deep in Eumedes’ throat, and told him:--"
10560,THE FINAL COMBAT,"“Lie down there, Trojan; measure off the acres"
10561,THE FINAL COMBAT,You sought in war! Any who dare attack me
10562,THE FINAL COMBAT,Are paid rewards like these; they build their walls
10563,THE FINAL COMBAT,On such foundations!” He flung the spear and brought him
10564,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Companions in his death, Asbytes, Chloreus,"
10565,THE FINAL COMBAT,Thersilochus and Sybaris and Dares
10566,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And finally Thymoetes, slain on horseback."
10567,THE FINAL COMBAT,As the north wind roars over the deep Aegean
10568,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Piling the combers shoreward, and in heaven"
10569,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Clouds flee the blast of the gale, so, before Turnus,"
10570,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The columns yield, the lines give way, and his onrush"
10571,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Bears him along, and the wind of his going tosses"
10572,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The nodding plume. And Phegeus tried to stop him,"
10573,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Flinging himself before the car, and grabbing,"
10574,THE FINAL COMBAT,"With his right hand, the bridle, twisting, wrenching"
10575,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The foaming jaws, and while he rode the yoke"
10576,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The spear-point found his side uncovered, piercing"
10577,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The mail with grazing wound, but Phegeus managed"
10578,THE FINAL COMBAT,To keep the shield before him and for safety
10579,THE FINAL COMBAT,Tried to keep coming forward--the drawn sword
10580,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Would be the best protection, but the axle"
10581,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Caught him, the wheels went over him, and Turnus"
10582,THE FINAL COMBAT,Swept by and the scythe of Turnus’ sword cut through him
10583,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Between the shield and helmet, and the body"
10584,THE FINAL COMBAT,Lay headless on the sand.
10585,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10586,THE FINAL COMBAT,"While Turnus, winning,"
10587,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Slaughtered across the field of war, Achates,"
10588,THE FINAL COMBAT,"With Mnestheus at his side, and young Iulus,"
10589,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Brought back Aeneas to camp, bleeding and limping,"
10590,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Using the spear as crutch, struggling, in anger,"
10591,THE FINAL COMBAT,To pull the barb from the wound; the shaft had broken.
10592,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The thing to do, he tells them over and over,"
10593,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The quickest way would be to cut around it,"
10594,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Let the sword do the probing, find the spear-point"
10595,THE FINAL COMBAT,"No matter how deep it tries to hide, expose it,"
10596,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Get it out of there, and send him back to battle."
10597,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And Iapyx came to help, the son of Iasus,"
10598,THE FINAL COMBAT,Dearest beyond all others to Apollo
10599,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Who once had offered him his arts, his powers,"
10600,THE FINAL COMBAT,"His augury, his lyre, the lore of arrows,"
10601,THE FINAL COMBAT,"But Iapyx made another choice; his father,"
10602,THE FINAL COMBAT,"It seemed, was dying, and he chose to save him"
10603,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Through what Apollo had the power to offer,"
10604,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Knowledge of simples and the arts of healing,"
10605,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And so he chose the silent craft, inglorious."
10606,THE FINAL COMBAT,"So there was Iapyx, trying to be helpful,"
10607,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Aeneas, leaning on his spear, and cursing,"
10608,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Indifferent to Iulus’ tears, and others"
10609,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Standing around, and anxious. The old doctor"
10610,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Tucked up his robe, compounded potent herbs,"
10611,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Applied them, fussed around, all to no purpose;"
10612,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Tried to extract the dart by hand, and then by forceps,--"
10613,THE FINAL COMBAT,"No luck at all: Apollo does not guide him,"
10614,THE FINAL COMBAT,And more and more across the plains the horror
10615,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Thickens, and evil nears. They see the sky"
10616,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Standing on dust; horsemen come on, and arrows"
10617,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Are falling thick, and a mournful din arises"
10618,THE FINAL COMBAT,"As fighting men go down, with Mars relentless."
10619,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10620,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Then Venus, shaken with a mother’s anguish"
10621,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Over a suffering son, from Cretan Ida"
10622,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Plucked dittany, a plant with downy leaves"
10623,THE FINAL COMBAT,And crimson blossom: the wild goats know and use it
10624,THE FINAL COMBAT,As cure for arrow-wounds. This herb the goddess
10625,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Brought down, her presence veiled in cloud, and steeped it"
10626,THE FINAL COMBAT,With secret healing in the river-water
10627,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Poured in the shining caldrons, and she added"
10628,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Ambrosia’s healing juice, and panacea,"
10629,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And agèd Iapyx washed the wound, unknowing"
10630,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The virtues of that balm, and all the pain"
10631,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Suddenly, and by magic, left the body;"
10632,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The blood was staunched, deep in the wound; the arrow"
10633,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Dropped from the flesh, at the least touch; the hero"
10634,THE FINAL COMBAT,Felt all his strength return. “Quick! Bring his weapons!”
10635,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Iapyx cries out, the first to fire their spirit"
10636,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Against the foe, “Why are you standing there,"
10637,THE FINAL COMBAT,What are you waiting for? These things have happened
10638,THE FINAL COMBAT,"By more than mortal aid or master talent,"
10639,THE FINAL COMBAT,"It is not my hand, Aeneas, that has saved you,"
10640,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Some greater god is working here, to send you"
10641,THE FINAL COMBAT,"To greater deeds.” Aeneas, eager for battle,"
10642,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Had the gold shin-guards on while he was talking,"
10643,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Makes the spear flash, impatient, gets the armor"
10644,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Buckled about the body, and the sword"
10645,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Ready at the left side, and through the helmet"
10646,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Stoops down to kiss Iulus:--“Learn, my son,"
10647,THE FINAL COMBAT,"What I can show you, valor and real labor:"
10648,THE FINAL COMBAT,Learn about luck from others. Now my hand
10649,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Will be your shield in war, your guide to glory,"
10650,THE FINAL COMBAT,"To great rewards. When you are grown, remember;"
10651,THE FINAL COMBAT,"You will have models for your inspiration,"
10652,THE FINAL COMBAT,Your father Aeneas and your uncle Hector.”
10653,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10654,THE FINAL COMBAT,"So from the gates he rushed, a mighty warrior"
10655,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Wielding a mighty spear, and all the column"
10656,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Came pouring forth; Mnestheus, Antheus, others,"
10657,THE FINAL COMBAT,Leave the forsaken camp. The dust is blinding
10658,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Over the plain, the tramp of armies marching"
10659,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Makes the earth tremble, and from the opposite hillside"
10660,THE FINAL COMBAT,Turnus and the Ausonians saw them coming
10661,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And a cold chill ran through their bones; Juturna,"
10662,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Quicker than all the Latins, heard the sound,"
10663,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Knew it, and fled in terror. And Aeneas"
10664,THE FINAL COMBAT,Rushed his dark column over open country
10665,THE FINAL COMBAT,As a cloud-burst sweeps to land across the ocean
10666,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And farmers know it, far away, and shudder"
10667,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Fearful and sure of ruin to woods and cornfield,"
10668,THE FINAL COMBAT,And the winds fly on before the storm and herald
10669,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The roaring sound to the shore; so, like a cloud-burst,"
10670,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Aeneas brings his armies on; they gather,"
10671,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Each company, at his side. Thymbraeus’ sword"
10672,THE FINAL COMBAT,Strikes down Osiris; Mnestheus slays Arcetius;
10673,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Achates Epulo, and Gyas Ufens."
10674,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Tolumnius, that augur whose spear had broken"
10675,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The armistice, lies low. A shout arises:"
10676,THE FINAL COMBAT,The Rutulians turn back in rout; the dust-clouds
10677,THE FINAL COMBAT,Follow them over the field in flight. Aeneas
10678,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Disdains to kill retreating men, refuses"
10679,THE FINAL COMBAT,Attack on such as face him; it is Turnus
10680,THE FINAL COMBAT,"He watches for, hunts through the gloom of battle,"
10681,THE FINAL COMBAT,"It is Turnus, Turnus only, whom he summons."
10682,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10683,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And this Juturna knows, and in her panic"
10684,THE FINAL COMBAT,"She flings Metiscus, charioteer of Turnus,"
10685,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Out of the car, far from the reins and axle,"
10686,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And takes his place, plying the supple reins,"
10687,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Calls with Metiscus’ voice, assumes his armor."
10688,THE FINAL COMBAT,As a dark swallow through a rich man’s mansion
10689,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Flies winging through great halls, hunting for crumbs"
10690,THE FINAL COMBAT,"For the young birds at home, and now chirps under"
10691,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The empty courts, now over the quiet pool,"
10692,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Even so, Juturna, by the horses carried,"
10693,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Darts here and there, quarters the field, and proudly"
10694,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Makes a great show of Turnus, her cheering brother,"
10695,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Yet never lets him close in fight or grapple,"
10696,THE FINAL COMBAT,Forever wheeling and turning. But Aeneas
10697,THE FINAL COMBAT,Is dogged in pursuit and loud in challenge.
10698,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Whenever he sees that car, and runs to meet it,"
10699,THE FINAL COMBAT,Juturna shifts the course. What can he do?
10700,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Nothing, it seems, but boil in rage; one anger"
10701,THE FINAL COMBAT,Makes conflict in his heart against another.
10702,THE FINAL COMBAT,Messapus comes against him; his left hand
10703,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Holds two tough lances, tipped with steel: advancing,"
10704,THE FINAL COMBAT,"He levels one, well-aimed; Aeneas crouches"
10705,THE FINAL COMBAT,"On one knee under the shield, but the spear, flying,"
10706,THE FINAL COMBAT,Picks off the crested plume from the top of the helmet.
10707,THE FINAL COMBAT,Aeneas’ anger swells; this treachery rankles.
10708,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Messapus’ chariot and steeds, withdrawing,"
10709,THE FINAL COMBAT,Are far away. He has made appeal to Jove
10710,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And the broken treaty’s altars all too often,"
10711,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And now he fights in earnest; Mars beside him,"
10712,THE FINAL COMBAT,"He rouses terrible carnage, giving anger"
10713,THE FINAL COMBAT,Free rein: he makes no choice of opposition.
10714,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10715,THE FINAL COMBAT,What singer or what god could tell the story
10716,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Of all these deaths? Both Turnus and Aeneas,"
10717,THE FINAL COMBAT,"In turn, drive victims over all the plain."
10718,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Jupiter willed it so, that mighty nations,"
10719,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Destined, in time, for everlasting friendship,"
10720,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Should meet in that great struggle. A Rutulian,"
10721,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Sucro, held off Aeneas for a little,"
10722,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And died more quickly, with the sword-point driven"
10723,THE FINAL COMBAT,Through ribs’ protecting framework. Turnus met
10724,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Amycus, and unsaddled him; his brother,"
10725,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Diores, fought on foot, and Turnus killed them,"
10726,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The one by spear, the one by sword; his chariot"
10727,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Bore off their severed heads, blood dripping from them."
10728,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Aeneas, in one charge, brought down three warriors,"
10729,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Talos and Tanais and brave Cethegus,"
10730,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And then one more, the sorrowful Onites,"
10731,THE FINAL COMBAT,Whose mother was Peridia; and Turnus
10732,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Killed brethren, Lycian born, and young Menoetes"
10733,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Who hated war, in vain, and once loved fishing"
10734,THE FINAL COMBAT,In Lerna’s rivers; his Arcadian dwelling
10735,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Had been a cottage, and his father planted"
10736,THE FINAL COMBAT,Land that he did not own. Like fire through forest
10737,THE FINAL COMBAT,"When underbrush is dry, and laurel crackles,"
10738,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Or like two mountain-torrents roaring seaward,"
10739,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Each leaving devastation, so Aeneas"
10740,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And Turnus swept the battle, anger surging,"
10741,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Surging in those great hearts, swollen to bursting,"
10742,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Not knowing how to yield, all strength devoted"
10743,THE FINAL COMBAT,To death and wounds.
10744,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10745,THE FINAL COMBAT,"There was a man, Murranus,"
10746,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Whose pride of ancestry was loud and boastful,"
10747,THE FINAL COMBAT,Last of a line of Latin kings. Aeneas
10748,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Brought him to earth and laid him low; a stone,"
10749,THE FINAL COMBAT,"A mighty whirling rock served as the weapon,"
10750,THE FINAL COMBAT,And under reins and under yoke the wheels
10751,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Rolled him along, and over him the horses"
10752,THE FINAL COMBAT,Trampled in earth the lord they had forgotten.
10753,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Hyllus rushed Turnus, and a javelin met him"
10754,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Through the gold temple-band, and pierced the helmet"
10755,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And lodged there, in the brain. A brave man, Cretheus,"
10756,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Had no defense against the might of Turnus,"
10757,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And no god saved Cupencus from Aeneas,"
10758,THE FINAL COMBAT,No shield of bronze delayed the speeding weapon.
10759,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Aeolus fell, stretched on the plains, a hero"
10760,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Too powerful for all the Greek battalions,"
10761,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Whom even Achilles, overthrower of Troy,"
10762,THE FINAL COMBAT,Could not bring down. He reached his goal of death
10763,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Here in Laurentum, a man whose home, Lyrnesus,"
10764,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Lay at the foot of Ida, but his tomb"
10765,THE FINAL COMBAT,Was on Italian soil. So all the lines
10766,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Turned to the battle, Mnestheus, Serestus,"
10767,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Messapus, tamer of horses, brave Asilas,"
10768,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Etruscan columns and Evander’s squadrons,"
10769,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Latins and Trojans, all of them contending"
10770,THE FINAL COMBAT,"With all their might, no rest, no pause, no slacking."
10771,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10772,THE FINAL COMBAT,And now his goddess-mother sent Aeneas
10773,THE FINAL COMBAT,"A change of purpose, to direct his column"
10774,THE FINAL COMBAT,"More quickly toward the town, confuse the Latins"
10775,THE FINAL COMBAT,With sudden onslaught. He was tracking Turnus
10776,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Here, there, all up and down the columns, watching,"
10777,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Shifting his gaze, and so he saw that city"
10778,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Immune from that fierce warfare, calm and peaceful."
10779,THE FINAL COMBAT,The vision of a greater fight comes to him:
10780,THE FINAL COMBAT,"He calls Sergestus, Mnestheus, brave Serestus,"
10781,THE FINAL COMBAT,And takes position on a mound; the Trojans
10782,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Come massing toward him, shield and spear held ready."
10783,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And as he stands above them, he gives the orders:--"
10784,THE FINAL COMBAT,“Let there be no delay: great Jove is with us.
10785,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Let no man go more slackly, though this venture"
10786,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Is new and unexpected. That city yonder,"
10787,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The cause of war, the kingdom of Latinus,"
10788,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Unless they own our mastery, acknowledge"
10789,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Defeat, declare obedience, I will topple,"
10790,THE FINAL COMBAT,Level its smoking roof-tops to the ground.
10791,THE FINAL COMBAT,Or should I wait until it suits prince Turnus
10792,THE FINAL COMBAT,"To face the duel with me, and, once beaten,"
10793,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Consent to fight again? This is the head,"
10794,THE FINAL COMBAT,"O citizens, this the evil crown of warfare."
10795,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Hurry, bring firebrands, win from fire the treaty!”"
10796,THE FINAL COMBAT,"His words inflame their zeal, and, all together"
10797,THE FINAL COMBAT,"They form a wedge; a great mass moves to the wall,"
10798,THE FINAL COMBAT,Ladders and sudden fire appear from nowhere;
10799,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The guards at the gate are butchered; steel is flying,"
10800,THE FINAL COMBAT,The sky is dark with arrows. Toward the city
10801,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Aeneas lifts his hand, rebukes Latinus,"
10802,THE FINAL COMBAT,Calling the gods to witness that his will
10803,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Was not for battle, it was forced upon him"
10804,THE FINAL COMBAT,"By the Italians, double treaty-breakers,"
10805,THE FINAL COMBAT,His foes for now the second time. The townsmen
10806,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Quarrel among themselves: “Open the town!”,"
10807,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Cry some, “Admit the Trojans!” and would drag"
10808,THE FINAL COMBAT,The king himself to the ramparts. Others hurry
10809,THE FINAL COMBAT,"With arms, man the defenses. When a shepherd"
10810,THE FINAL COMBAT,Trails bees to their hive in the cleft of a rock and fills it
10811,THE FINAL COMBAT,"With smarting smoke, there is fright and noise and fury"
10812,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Within the waxen camp, and anger sharpened"
10813,THE FINAL COMBAT,"With buzzing noises, and a black smell rises"
10814,THE FINAL COMBAT,"With a blind sound, inside the rock, and rolling"
10815,THE FINAL COMBAT,Smoke lifts to empty air.
10816,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10817,THE FINAL COMBAT,Now a new sorrow
10818,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Came to the weary Latins, shook the city"
10819,THE FINAL COMBAT,"To its foundations, utterly. The queen"
10820,THE FINAL COMBAT,Had seen the Trojans coming and the walls
10821,THE FINAL COMBAT,Under attack and fire along the gables
10822,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And no Rutulian column, nowhere Turnus"
10823,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Coming to help. He had been killed, her hero,"
10824,THE FINAL COMBAT,She knew at last. Her mind was gone; she cried
10825,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Over and over:--“I am the guilty one,"
10826,THE FINAL COMBAT,"I am the cause, the source of all these evils!”"
10827,THE FINAL COMBAT,And other wilder words. And then she tore
10828,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Her crimson robes, and slung a noose and fastened"
10829,THE FINAL COMBAT,The knot of an ugly death to the high rafter.
10830,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The women learned it first, and then Lavinia:"
10831,THE FINAL COMBAT,The wide hall rings with grief and lamentation;
10832,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Nails scratch at lovely faces, beautiful hair"
10833,THE FINAL COMBAT,Is torn from the head. And Rumor spreads the story
10834,THE FINAL COMBAT,"All up and down the town, and poor Latinus,"
10835,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Rending his garments, comes and stares,--wife gone,"
10836,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And city falling, an old man’s hoary hair"
10837,THE FINAL COMBAT,Greyer with bloody dust.
10838,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10839,THE FINAL COMBAT,And meanwhile Turnus
10840,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Out on the plain pursues the stragglers, slower"
10841,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And slower now, and less and less exultant"
10842,THE FINAL COMBAT,In his triumphant car. From the city comes
10843,THE FINAL COMBAT,"A wind that bears a cry confused with terror,"
10844,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Half heard, but known,--confusion, darkness, sorrow,"
10845,THE FINAL COMBAT,"An uproar in the town. He checks the horses,"
10846,THE FINAL COMBAT,Pauses and listens. And his sister prompts him:--
10847,THE FINAL COMBAT,"“This way, this way! The Trojans run, we follow"
10848,THE FINAL COMBAT,Where victory shows the path. Let others guard
10849,THE FINAL COMBAT,The houses with their valor. The Italians
10850,THE FINAL COMBAT,Fall in the fight before Aeneas. Let us
10851,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Send death to the Trojans, in our turn. You will not"
10852,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Come off the worse, in numbers or in honor.”"
10853,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Turnus replies:--“O sister, I have known,"
10854,THE FINAL COMBAT,"A long while since, that you were no Metiscus,"
10855,THE FINAL COMBAT,Since first you broke the treaty and joined the battle.
10856,THE FINAL COMBAT,No use pretending you are not a goddess.
10857,THE FINAL COMBAT,"But who, from high Olympus, sent you down"
10858,THE FINAL COMBAT,To bear such labors? Was it to see your brother
10859,THE FINAL COMBAT,"In pitiful cruel death? What am I doing,"
10860,THE FINAL COMBAT,What chance will fortune grant me? I have seen
10861,THE FINAL COMBAT,"A man I loved more than the rest, Murranus,"
10862,THE FINAL COMBAT,"A big man, slain by a big wound, go down."
10863,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Ufens is fallen, lucky or unlucky,"
10864,THE FINAL COMBAT,In that he never saw our shame; the Trojans
10865,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Have won his body and arms. Our homes are burning,"
10866,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The one thing lacking up to now,--and shall I"
10867,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Endure this, not refute the words of Drances"
10868,THE FINAL COMBAT,With this right hand? Shall I turn my back upon them?
10869,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Is it so grim to die? Be kind, O shadows,"
10870,THE FINAL COMBAT,Since the high gods have turned their favor from me.
10871,THE FINAL COMBAT,"A decent spirit, undisgraced, no coward,"
10872,THE FINAL COMBAT,"I shall descend to you, never unworthy"
10873,THE FINAL COMBAT,Of all my ancient line.”
10874,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10875,THE FINAL COMBAT,He had hardly spoken
10876,THE FINAL COMBAT,"When a warrior, on foaming steed, came riding"
10877,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Through all the enemy. His name was Saces,"
10878,THE FINAL COMBAT,And his face was badly wounded by an arrow.
10879,THE FINAL COMBAT,"He called the name of Turnus, and implored him:--"
10880,THE FINAL COMBAT,“We have no other hope; pity your people!
10881,THE FINAL COMBAT,Aeneas is a lightning-bolt; he threatens
10882,THE FINAL COMBAT,Italy’s topmost towers; he will bring them down
10883,THE FINAL COMBAT,In ruins; even now the brands are flying
10884,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Along the roof-tops. They look to you, the Latins,"
10885,THE FINAL COMBAT,They look for you; and king Latinus mumbles
10886,THE FINAL COMBAT,"In doubt--who are his sons, who are his allies?"
10887,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The queen, who trusted you the most, has perished"
10888,THE FINAL COMBAT,"By her own hand, has fled the light in terror."
10889,THE FINAL COMBAT,Alone before the gates the brave Atinas
10890,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And Messapus hold the line. Around them, squadrons"
10891,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Crowd close on either side, and the steel harvest"
10892,THE FINAL COMBAT,Bristles with pointed swords. And here is Turnus
10893,THE FINAL COMBAT,Wheeling his car across a plain deserted.”
10894,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10895,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Bewildered by disaster’s shifting image,"
10896,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Turnus is silent, staring; shame and sadness"
10897,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Boil up in that great heart, and grief and love"
10898,THE FINAL COMBAT,Driven by frenzy. He shakes off the shadows;
10899,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The light comes back to his mind. His eyes turn, blazing,"
10900,THE FINAL COMBAT,From the wheels of the car to the walls of that great city
10901,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Where the flame billowed upward, the roaring blast"
10902,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Catching a tower, one he himself had fashioned"
10903,THE FINAL COMBAT,With jointed beams and rollers and high gangways.
10904,THE FINAL COMBAT,"“Fate is the winner now; keep out of my way,"
10905,THE FINAL COMBAT,My sister: now I follow god and fortune.
10906,THE FINAL COMBAT,"I am ready for Aeneas, ready to bear"
10907,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Whatever is bitter in death. No longer, sister,"
10908,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Shall I be shamed, and you behold me. Let me,"
10909,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Before the final madness, be a madman!”"
10910,THE FINAL COMBAT,"He bounded from the chariot, came rushing"
10911,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Through spears, through enemies; his grieving sister"
10912,THE FINAL COMBAT,"He left behind, forgotten. As a boulder"
10913,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Torn from a mountain-top rolls headlong downward,"
10914,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Impelled by wind, or washed by storm, or loosened"
10915,THE FINAL COMBAT,"By time’s erosion, and comes down the hillside"
10916,THE FINAL COMBAT,"A mass possessed of evil, leaping and bounding,"
10917,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And rolling with it men and trees and cattle,"
10918,THE FINAL COMBAT,"So, through the broken columns, Turnus rushes"
10919,THE FINAL COMBAT,"On to the city, where the blood goes deepest"
10920,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Into the muddy ground, and the air whistles"
10921,THE FINAL COMBAT,"With flying spears. He makes a sudden gesture,"
10922,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Crying aloud:--“No more, no more, Rutulians!"
10923,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Hold back your weapons, Latins! Whatever fortune"
10924,THE FINAL COMBAT,"There may be here is mine. I am the one,"
10925,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Not you, to make the treaty good, to settle"
10926,THE FINAL COMBAT,The issue with the sword. That will be better.”
10927,THE FINAL COMBAT,They all made way and gave him room.
10928,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10929,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Aeneas,"
10930,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Hearing the name of Turnus, leaves the city,"
10931,THE FINAL COMBAT,Forsakes the lofty walls; he has no patience
10932,THE FINAL COMBAT,"With any more delay, breaks off all projects,"
10933,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Exults, a terrible thunderer in armor,"
10934,THE FINAL COMBAT,"As huge as Athos, or as huge as Eryx,"
10935,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Or even father Apennine, that mountain"
10936,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Roaring above the oaks, and lifting high"
10937,THE FINAL COMBAT,His crown of shimmering trees and snowy crest.
10938,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Now all men turned their eyes, Rutulians, Trojans,"
10939,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Italians, those who held the lofty ramparts,"
10940,THE FINAL COMBAT,Those battering at the wall below; their shoulders
10941,THE FINAL COMBAT,Were eased of armor now. And king Latinus
10942,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Could hardly, in amazement, trust his senses"
10943,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Seeing these two big men, born worlds apart"
10944,THE FINAL COMBAT,Meeting to make decision with the sword.
10945,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The plain was cleared, and they came rushing forward,"
10946,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Hurling, far off, their spears; the fight is on,"
10947,THE FINAL COMBAT,The bronze shields clang and ring. Earth gives a groan.
10948,THE FINAL COMBAT,The swords strike hard and often; luck and courage
10949,THE FINAL COMBAT,Are blent in one. And as on mighty Sila
10950,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Or on Taburnus’ mountain, when two bullocks"
10951,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Charge into fight head-on, and trembling herdsmen"
10952,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Fall back in fear, and the herd is dumb with terror,"
10953,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And heifers, hardly lowing, stare and wonder"
10954,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Which one will rule the woodland, which one the herd"
10955,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Will follow meekly after, and all the time"
10956,THE FINAL COMBAT,"They gore each other with savage horns, and shoulders"
10957,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And necks and ribs run streams of blood, and bellowing"
10958,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Fills all the woodland,--even so, Aeneas"
10959,THE FINAL COMBAT,And Daunus’ son clash shield on shield; the clamor
10960,THE FINAL COMBAT,Fills heaven. And Jupiter holds the scales in balance
10961,THE FINAL COMBAT,"With each man’s destiny as weight and counter,"
10962,THE FINAL COMBAT,And one the heavier under the doom of death.
10963,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10964,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Confident, Turnus, rising to the sword"
10965,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Full height, is a flash of light; he strikes. The Trojans,"
10966,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The Latins, cry aloud and come up standing."
10967,THE FINAL COMBAT,But the sword is treacherous; it is broken off
10968,THE FINAL COMBAT,With the blow half spent: the fire of Turnus finds
10969,THE FINAL COMBAT,No help except in flight. Swift as the wind
10970,THE FINAL COMBAT,"He goes, and stares at a broken blade, a hand"
10971,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Unarmed. The story is that in that hurry,"
10972,THE FINAL COMBAT,"That rush of his, to arms, when the steeds were harnessed,"
10973,THE FINAL COMBAT,"He took Metiscus’ sword, not the one Daunus"
10974,THE FINAL COMBAT,Had left him. For a while it served its purpose
10975,THE FINAL COMBAT,"While the Trojans ran away, but when it met"
10976,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The armor Vulcan forged, the mortal blade"
10977,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Split off, like brittle ice, with glittering splinters"
10978,THE FINAL COMBAT,Like ice on the yellow sand. So Turnus flies
10979,THE FINAL COMBAT,Madly across the plain in devious circles:
10980,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The Trojans ring him round, and a swamp on one side,"
10981,THE FINAL COMBAT,High walls on the other.
10982,THE FINAL COMBAT,
10983,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Aeneas, the pursuer,"
10984,THE FINAL COMBAT,Is none too swift: the arrow has left him hurt;
10985,THE FINAL COMBAT,"His knees give way, but he keeps on, keeps coming"
10986,THE FINAL COMBAT,"After the panting enemy, as a hound,"
10987,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Running a stag to bay, at the edge of the water"
10988,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Or hedged by crimson plumes, darts in, and barks,"
10989,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And snaps his jaws, closes and grips, is shaken"
10990,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Off from the flanks again, and once more closes,"
10991,THE FINAL COMBAT,And a great noise goes up the air; the waters
10992,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Resound, and the whole sky thunders with the clamor."
10993,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Turnus has time, even in flight, for calling"
10994,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Loud to Rutulians, each by name, demanding,"
10995,THE FINAL COMBAT,"In terrible rage, the sword, the sword, the good one,"
10996,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The one he knows. Let anybody bring it,"
10997,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Aeneas threatens, and death and doom await him,"
10998,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And the town will be a ruin. Wounded, still"
10999,THE FINAL COMBAT,"He presses on. They go in five great circles,"
11000,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Around and back: no game, with silly prizes,"
11001,THE FINAL COMBAT,Are they playing now; the life and blood of Turnus
11002,THE FINAL COMBAT,Go to the winner.
11003,THE FINAL COMBAT,
11004,THE FINAL COMBAT,A wild olive-tree
11005,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Stood here, with bitter leaves, sacred to Faunus,"
11006,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Revered by rescued sailors, who used to offer"
11007,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Ex-votos to the native gods, their garments"
11008,THE FINAL COMBAT,In token of gratitude. For this the Trojans
11009,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Cared nothing, lopped the branches off to clear"
11010,THE FINAL COMBAT,The run of the field. Aeneas’ spear had fastened
11011,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Deep in the trunk where the force of the cast had brought it,"
11012,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Stuck in the grip of the root. Aeneas, stooping,"
11013,THE FINAL COMBAT,Yanks at the shaft; he cannot equal Turnus
11014,THE FINAL COMBAT,In speed of foot but the javelin is wingèd.
11015,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And Turnus, in a terrible moment of panic,"
11016,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Cries:--“Faunus, pity me, and Earth, most kindly,"
11017,THE FINAL COMBAT,"If ever I was reverent, as Aeneas"
11018,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And those he leads have not been, hold the steel,"
11019,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Do not let go!” He prayed, and he was answered."
11020,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Aeneas tugged and wrestled, pulled and hauled,"
11021,THE FINAL COMBAT,"But the wood held on. And, while he strained, Juturna"
11022,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Rushed forward, once again Metiscus’ double,"
11023,THE FINAL COMBAT,"With the good sword for her brother. Then Venus, angry"
11024,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Over such wanton interference, enters"
11025,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And the root yields. The warriors, towering high,"
11026,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Each one renewed in spirit, one with sword,"
11027,THE FINAL COMBAT,"One with the spear, both breathing hard, are ready"
11028,THE FINAL COMBAT,For what Mars has to send.
11029,THE FINAL COMBAT,
11030,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And Juno, gazing"
11031,THE FINAL COMBAT,"From a golden cloud to earth, watching the duel,"
11032,THE FINAL COMBAT,Heard the all-powerful king of high Olympus:--
11033,THE FINAL COMBAT,"“What will the end be now, O wife? What else"
11034,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Remains? You know, and you admit you know it,"
11035,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Aeneas is heaven-destined, the native hero"
11036,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Become a god, raised by the fates, exalted."
11037,THE FINAL COMBAT,What are you planning? with what hope lingering on
11038,THE FINAL COMBAT,In the cold clouds? Was it proper that a mortal
11039,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Should wound a god? that the sword, once lost, be given"
11040,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Turnus again?--Juturna, of course, is nothing"
11041,THE FINAL COMBAT,Without your help--was it proper that the beaten
11042,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Increase in violence? Stop it now, I tell you;"
11043,THE FINAL COMBAT,Listen to my entreaties: I would not have you
11044,THE FINAL COMBAT,Devoured by grief in silence; I would not have you
11045,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Bring me, again, anxiety and sorrow,"
11046,THE FINAL COMBAT,However sweet the voice. The end has come.
11047,THE FINAL COMBAT,"To harry the Trojans over land and ocean,"
11048,THE FINAL COMBAT,"To light up war unspeakable, to defile"
11049,THE FINAL COMBAT,"A home with grief, to mingle bridal and sorrow,--"
11050,THE FINAL COMBAT,All this you were permitted. Go no farther!
11051,THE FINAL COMBAT,"That is an absolute order.” And Juno, downcast"
11052,THE FINAL COMBAT,"In gaze, replied:--“Great Jove, I knew your pleasure:"
11053,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And therefore, much against my will, left Turnus,"
11054,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Left earth. Were it not so, you would not see me"
11055,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Lonely upon my airy throne in heaven,"
11056,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Enduring things both worthy and unworthy,"
11057,THE FINAL COMBAT,"But I would be down there, by flame surrounded,"
11058,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Fighting in the front ranks, and hauling Trojans"
11059,THE FINAL COMBAT,"To battle with their enemies. Juturna,"
11060,THE FINAL COMBAT,"I urged, I own, to help her wretched brother,"
11061,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And I approved, I own, her greater daring"
11062,THE FINAL COMBAT,"For his life’s sake, but I did not approve,"
11063,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And this I swear by Styx, that river whose name"
11064,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Binds all the gods to truth, her taking weapons,"
11065,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Aiming the bow. I give up now, I leave"
11066,THE FINAL COMBAT,"These battles, though I hate to. I ask one favor"
11067,THE FINAL COMBAT,"For Latium, for the greatness of your people,"
11068,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And this no law of fate forbids: when, later,"
11069,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And be it so, they join in peace, and settle"
11070,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Their laws, their treaties, in a blessèd marriage,"
11071,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Do not command the Latins, native-born,"
11072,THE FINAL COMBAT,"To change their language, to be known as Trojans,"
11073,THE FINAL COMBAT,"To alter speech or garb; let them be Latium,"
11074,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Let Alban kings endure through all the ages,"
11075,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Let Roman stock, strong in Italian valor,"
11076,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Prevail: since Troy has fallen, let her name"
11077,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Perish and be forgotten.” Smiling on her,"
11078,THE FINAL COMBAT,The great creator answered:--“You are truly
11079,THE FINAL COMBAT,"True sister of Jove and child of Saturn, nursing"
11080,THE FINAL COMBAT,Such tides of anger in the heart! Forget it!
11081,THE FINAL COMBAT,Abate the rise of passion. The wish is granted.
11082,THE FINAL COMBAT,"I yield, and more than that,--I share your purpose."
11083,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Ausonians shall keep their old tradition,"
11084,THE FINAL COMBAT,Their fathers’ speech and ways; their name shall be
11085,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Even as now it is. Their sacred laws,"
11086,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Their ritual, I shall add, and make all Latins"
11087,THE FINAL COMBAT,Men of a common tongue. A race shall rise
11088,THE FINAL COMBAT,"All-powerful, of mingled blood; you will see them"
11089,THE FINAL COMBAT,By virtue of devotion rise to glories
11090,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Not men nor gods have known, and no race ever"
11091,THE FINAL COMBAT,Will pay you equal honor.” And the goddess
11092,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Gave her assent, was happy, changed her purpose,"
11093,THE FINAL COMBAT,Left heaven and quit the cloud.
11094,THE FINAL COMBAT,
11095,THE FINAL COMBAT,"This done, the father"
11096,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Formed yet another purpose, that Juturna"
11097,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Should leave her fighting brother. There are, men say,"
11098,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Twin fiends, or triple, sisters named the Furies,"
11099,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Daughters of Night, with snaky coils, and pinions"
11100,THE FINAL COMBAT,Like those of wind. They are attendant spirits
11101,THE FINAL COMBAT,Before the throne of Jove and whet the fears
11102,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Of sickly mortals, when the king of heaven"
11103,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Contrives disease or dreadful death, or frightens"
11104,THE FINAL COMBAT,The guilty towns in war. Now he dispatches
11105,THE FINAL COMBAT,"One of the three to earth, to meet Juturna,"
11106,THE FINAL COMBAT,An omen visible; and so from heaven
11107,THE FINAL COMBAT,"She flew with whirlwind swiftness, like an arrow"
11108,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Through cloud from bowstring, armed with gall or poison,"
11109,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Loosed from a Parthian quiver, cleaving shadows"
11110,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Swifter than man may know, a shaft no power"
11111,THE FINAL COMBAT,Has power of healing over:--so Night’s daughter
11112,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Came down to earth, and when she saw the Trojans"
11113,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And Turnus’ columns, she dwindled, all of a sudden,"
11114,THE FINAL COMBAT,"To the shape of that small bird, which, in the night-time,"
11115,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Shrills its late song, ill-omened, on the roof-tops"
11116,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Or over tombs, insistent through the darkness."
11117,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And so the fiend, the little screech-owl, flying"
11118,THE FINAL COMBAT,"At Turnus, over and over, shrilled in warning,"
11119,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Beating the wings against the shield, and Turnus"
11120,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Felt a strange torpor seize his limbs, and terror"
11121,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Made his hair rise, and his voice could find no utterance."
11122,THE FINAL COMBAT,
11123,THE FINAL COMBAT,"But when, far off, Juturna knew the Fury"
11124,THE FINAL COMBAT,"By whir of those dread wings, she tore her tresses,"
11125,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Clawed at her face, and beat her breast, all anguish"
11126,THE FINAL COMBAT,Over her brother:--“What can a sister do
11127,THE FINAL COMBAT,"To help you now, poor Turnus? What remains"
11128,THE FINAL COMBAT,For me to bear? I have borne so much already.
11129,THE FINAL COMBAT,What skill of mine can make the daylight longer
11130,THE FINAL COMBAT,In your dark hour? Can I face such a portent?
11131,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Now, now, I leave the battle-line forever."
11132,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Foul birds, I fear enough; haunt me no further,"
11133,THE FINAL COMBAT,"I know that beat of the wings, that deadly whirring;"
11134,THE FINAL COMBAT,"I recognize, too well, Jove’s arrogant orders,"
11135,THE FINAL COMBAT,His payment for my maidenhood. He gave me
11136,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Eternal life, but why? Why has he taken"
11137,THE FINAL COMBAT,The right of death away from me? I might have
11138,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Ended my anguish, surely, with my brother’s,"
11139,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Gone, at his side, among the fearful shadows,"
11140,THE FINAL COMBAT,"But, no,--I am immortal. What is left me"
11141,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Of any possible joy, without my brother?"
11142,THE FINAL COMBAT,"What earth can open deep enough to take me,"
11143,THE FINAL COMBAT,"A goddess, to the lowest shades?” The mantle,"
11144,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Grey-colored, veiled her head, and the goddess, sighing,"
11145,THE FINAL COMBAT,Sank deep from sight to the greyness of the river.
11146,THE FINAL COMBAT,
11147,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And on Aeneas presses: the flashing spear,"
11148,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Brandished, is big as a tree; his anger cries:--"
11149,THE FINAL COMBAT,"“Why put it off forever, Turnus, hang-dog?"
11150,THE FINAL COMBAT,"We must fight with arms, not running. Take what shape"
11151,THE FINAL COMBAT,"You will, gather your strength or craft; fly up"
11152,THE FINAL COMBAT,"To the high stars, or bury yourself in earth!”"
11153,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And Turnus shook his head and answered:--“Jove,"
11154,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Being my enemy, scares me, and the gods,"
11155,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Not your hot words, fierce fellow.” And his vision,"
11156,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Glancing about, beheld a mighty boulder,"
11157,THE FINAL COMBAT,"A boundary-mark, in days of old, so huge"
11158,THE FINAL COMBAT,A dozen men in our degenerate era
11159,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Could hardly pry it loose from earth, but Turnus"
11160,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Lifts it full height, hurls it full speed and, acting."
11161,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Seems not to recognize himself, in running,"
11162,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Or moving, or lifting his hands, or letting the stone"
11163,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Fly into space; he shakes at the knees, his blood"
11164,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Runs chill in the veins, and the stone, through wide air going,"
11165,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Falls short, falls spent. As in our dreams at night-time,"
11166,THE FINAL COMBAT,"When sleep weighs down our eyes, we seem to be running,"
11167,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Or trying to run, and cannot, and we falter,"
11168,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Sick in our failure, and the tongue is thick"
11169,THE FINAL COMBAT,"And the words we try to utter come to nothing,"
11170,THE FINAL COMBAT,"No voice, no speech,--so Turnus finds the way"
11171,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Blocked off, wherever he turns, however bravely."
11172,THE FINAL COMBAT,All sorts of things go through his mind: he stares
11173,THE FINAL COMBAT,"At the Rutulians, at the town; he trembles,"
11174,THE FINAL COMBAT,Quails at the threat of the lance; he cannot see
11175,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Any way out, any way forward. Nothing."
11176,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The chariot is gone, and the charioteer,"
11177,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Juturna or Metiscus, nowhere near him."
11178,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The spear, flung by Aeneas, comes with a whir"
11179,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Louder than stone from any engine, louder"
11180,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Than thunderbolt; like a black wind it flies,"
11181,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Bringing destruction with it, through the shield-rim,"
11182,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Its sevenfold strength, through armor, through the thigh."
11183,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Turnus is down, on hands and knees, huge Turnus"
11184,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Struck to the earth. Groaning, the stunned Rutulians"
11185,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Rise to their feet, and the whole hill resounds,"
11186,THE FINAL COMBAT,"The wooded heights give echo. A suppliant, beaten,"
11187,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Humbled at last, his hands reach out, his voice"
11188,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Is low in pleading:--“I have deserved it, surely,"
11189,THE FINAL COMBAT,And I do not beg off. Use the advantage.
11190,THE FINAL COMBAT,But if a parent’s grief has any power
11191,THE FINAL COMBAT,"To touch the spirit, I pray you, pity Daunus,"
11192,THE FINAL COMBAT,"(I would Anchises), send him back my body."
11193,THE FINAL COMBAT,"You have won; I am beaten, and these hands go out"
11194,THE FINAL COMBAT,In supplication: everyone has seen it.
11195,THE FINAL COMBAT,No more. I have lost Lavinia. Let hatred
11196,THE FINAL COMBAT,Proceed no further.”
11197,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Fierce in his arms, with darting glance, Aeneas"
11198,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Paused for a moment, and he might have weakened,"
11199,THE FINAL COMBAT,"For the words had moved him, when, high on the shoulder,"
11200,THE FINAL COMBAT,"He saw the belt of Pallas, slain by Turnus,"
11201,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Saw Pallas on the ground, and Turnus wearing"
11202,THE FINAL COMBAT,"That belt with the bright studs, of evil omen"
11203,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Not only to Pallas now, a sad reminder,"
11204,THE FINAL COMBAT,A deadly provocation. Terrible
11205,THE FINAL COMBAT,"In wrath, Aeneas cries:--“Clad in this treasure,"
11206,THE FINAL COMBAT,"This trophy of a comrade, can you cherish"
11207,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Hope that my hands would let you go? Now Pallas,"
11208,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Pallas exacts his vengeance, and the blow"
11209,THE FINAL COMBAT,"Is Pallas, making sacrifice!” He struck"
11210,THE FINAL COMBAT,Before he finished speaking: the blade went deep
11211,THE FINAL COMBAT,And Turnus’ limbs were cold in death; the spirit
11212,THE FINAL COMBAT,Went with a moan indignant to the shadows.

11225,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,
11226,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,
11227,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"Publius Vergilius Maro, whom we call Virgil, was born up north in Italy,"
11228,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"somewhere in the vicinity of Mantua, in the year 70 B.C. Julius Caesar,"
11229,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"that year, was a man of thirty. The poet’s father was a landholder,"
11230,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,sufficiently affluent to afford his son a pretty extensive course of
11231,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"education. Virgil grew up to be tall, dark, perhaps a little rawboned"
11232,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"and loose-jointed, never very robust, quiet, no doubt, but with more fun"
11233,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"in him, and malice, too, if the ascription of the minor poems is"
11234,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"correct, than we sometimes think. As a youth, he studied first at"
11235,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"Cremona, then at Milan, and in this he was fortunate, for the scholars"
11236,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,of the north seemed to have laid more emphasis on the humanistic side of
11237,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"education, on arts, letters, and philosophy, than did the"
11238,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"materialist-minded rhetoricians of Rome. To Rome, in his late teens,"
11239,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"Virgil did go for pre-legal study, for him a not very congenial"
11240,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"experience; it is on record, according to Donatus, that he pleaded"
11241,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"exactly one case, and that unsuccessfully. He was twenty-one when Julius"
11242,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"Caesar crossed the Rubicon, and the Civil War flared up between Caesar"
11243,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"and Pompey, and it seems probable that he was pressed into service with"
11244,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"Caesar’s forces, not too much against his political sympathies, however"
11245,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,distasteful to his temperament. His service was not long: the state of
11246,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,his health may have brought him early leave or discharge; in his younger
11247,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,twenties he turned to the study of philosophy at Naples.
11248,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,
11249,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"He found good teachers there, Siro, Philodemus, highly trained men of"
11250,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"the Epicurean school, versed not only in Greek thought but familiar,"
11251,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"also, with the wisdom of the East. He found good fellow-students, too, a"
11252,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"remarkable list of influential Romans, men who were to be his lifelong"
11253,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"friends, as Naples was to be made his permanent home, in spite of"
11254,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"traveling, later, and the honor of an official residence at Rome. Naples"
11255,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"was a pleasant place to be during those years, above the battles that"
11256,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"broke and raged not only up and down the peninsula, but to east and"
11257,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"west, in Spain, in Gaul, in Thessaly, in Africa. The republican"
11258,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,institutions which had sufficed an agrarian economy were breaking down
11259,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,under the pressures of the new rising mercantile and almost industrial
11260,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,society; there had even been something like a primitive proletarian
11261,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,revolution under Spartacus; no Epicurean scorn for political ambitions
11262,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"could keep men’s consciences from being deeply troubled. Virgil,"
11263,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"conservative at heart, yet with a great admiration for Julius Caesar the"
11264,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"man, seems not to have been too bitter about the imminence of a"
11265,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"dictatorship; he would have preferred it not to be so called, and he"
11266,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"hoped, with all his soul and spirit, that it would be wisely and"
11267,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"mercifully administered, and he said so. He was twenty-six when Caesar"
11268,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"was assassinated on the Ides of March in 44 B.C., and the shock of that"
11269,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"event was enough to drive from his mind the ideas he had formed, in a"
11270,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"groping and immature wishfulness, of writing a national epic."
11271,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,
11272,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,Virgil was not much over thirty when his first substantial work was
11273,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"given publication. This consisted of the Eclogues, or Bucolics, ten"
11274,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"longish poems, ostensibly pastoral, modelled, to a certain extent, on"
11275,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,the Greek poet Theocritus. These poems were by no means purely escapist
11276,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"literature; they were full of allusions to recent political events,"
11277,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"sympathy for the victims of civil war, appeals to the victors for"
11278,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"compassion, gratitude that the patrimonial estates had suffered less"
11279,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,severely than some others under the policy of rewarding the veterans
11280,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"with places on the land. The young Octavian, victor, with Mark Antony,"
11281,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"over the Caesaricides Brutus and Cassius at Philippi, was impressionable"
11282,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"enough to be guided in decent ways, following his great-uncle’s"
11283,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"tradition of clemency; and Octavian, on his part, was sufficiently"
11284,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"tactful, as well as shrewd, to want to have the poets on his side. The"
11285,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"great success of the Eclogues rendered it highly desirable that Virgil,"
11286,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"along with other poets, be given something like official status; the"
11287,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"wealthy counsellor Maecenas, patron of the arts and member of the inner"
11288,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"circle, put a villa in his own gardens at the poet’s disposal. Here"
11289,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"Virgil found new friends, notably the poet Horace, five years his"
11290,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,junior--it lay much to the credit of Octavian’s decency that place could
11291,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,be made for a young satirist who had fought against him at Philippi
11292,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"(probably not very hard, if we can believe Horace’s own account) and"
11293,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,whose published work had been caustic about the government. So Virgil
11294,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"had security, recognition, freedom to travel with the distinguished on"
11295,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"official journeys, or to come and go as he pleased, with the privilege"
11296,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"of staying, whenever he was so minded, in his quieter gardens near"
11297,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,Naples.
11298,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,
11299,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"It was nearly a decade before the publication of his next major work,"
11300,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"the Georgics, a long poem, in four books, on the subject of husbandry."
11301,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"Those returned veterans, settled by tens of thousands on the land, knew,"
11302,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"it seemed, little of farming, and, for that matter, probably cared less."
11303,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"It was Virgil’s responsibility, under Octavian’s sanction, to instruct"
11304,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"them, to see to it that they should both know and care, have practical"
11305,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"information as to what must be done with crops and cattle and bees, and"
11306,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"at the same time develop faith and pride in what they were doing, return"
11307,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"to the simple virtues of the fathers, the good old republican ways. For"
11308,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"all its official status, however, the poem was just a little too honest"
11309,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,to be what we should consider ideal propaganda. There is no sentimental
11310,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"rapture in the Georgics, no idolization, idealization, or idyllization"
11311,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"of what life on a farm is like; the sober-minded citizen, in fact, might"
11312,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,easily be dissuaded from agriculture entirely by the accurate
11313,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,description of the various kinds of hell farming would put him through.
11314,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,
11315,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"By the time Virgil was putting the finishing touches to this book, the"
11316,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,unsettled condition of the Roman state had begun to change for the
11317,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"better. A decade’s opposition to Octavian, led by the sons of Pompey and"
11318,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"his old partner Antony, had come to an end with the defeat of Antony and"
11319,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,Cleopatra at the battle of Actium in 31 B.C. The East and West could
11320,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"join again; there could now be one world, under the tempered principate"
11321,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,of the man who had matured from the young Octavian into Caesar Augustus.
11322,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"And Virgil could turn to the project he had never forgotten, fulfill the"
11323,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"longings that, as allusions in both Eclogues and Georgics had shown,"
11324,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"still occupied at least his unconscious mind, the composition of an epic"
11325,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"poem that should justify this great nation, remind her citizens of all"
11326,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"she had cost, inspire them to be worthy of their tradition. To this"
11327,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"work, the Aeneid, Virgil devoted the rest of his life. He did not ever"
11328,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"consider it finished; he had still three years’ work ahead of him, he"
11329,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"estimated, when he went to Greece, at the age of fifty, to study more"
11330,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,carefully the scenes of the book in which he described the wanderings
11331,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"of Aeneas. There he fell ill, was brought back to Brundisium, on the"
11332,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"heel of Italy, where he died in 19 B.C. In his dissatisfaction with the"
11333,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"unfinished state of his work, he left instructions that the manuscript"
11334,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"of the Aeneid should be burned; Augustus, however, in the words of Tenny"
11335,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"Frank, “interposed the supreme authority of the state to annul that"
11336,VIRGIL’S LIFE AND TIMES,"clause of the will.” No dictator, ever, has exercised a happier veto."
