132,BOOK I.,"This doughty hero's boiling passion,"
133,BOOK I.,Which plagu'd the Greeks; and gave 'em double
134,BOOK I.,"A Christian's share of toil and trouble,"
135,BOOK I.,"And, in a manner quite uncivil,"
136,BOOK I.,Sent many a Broughton to the devil;
137,BOOK I.,"Leaving their carcasses on rows,"
138,BOOK I.,Food for great dogs and carrion crows.
139,BOOK I.,To this sad pass the bully's freaks
140,BOOK I.,Had brought his countryfolks the Greeks!
141,BOOK I.,"But who the devil durst say no,"
142,BOOK I.,Since surly Jove would have it so?
143,BOOK I.,"Come tell us then, dear Miss, from whence"
144,BOOK I.,The quarrel rose: who gave th' offence?
145,BOOK I.,"Latona's son, with fiery locks,"
146,BOOK I.,Amongst them sent both plague and pox.
147,BOOK I.,"And prov'd most damnably obdurate,"
148,BOOK I.,Because the king had vex'd his curate;
149,BOOK I.,"For which offence the god annoy'd 'em,"

153,BOOK I.,A red nosed priest came hobbling after
154,BOOK I.,With presents to redeem his daughter.
155,BOOK I.,"Like a poor supplicant did stand,"
156,BOOK I.,"With an old garland in his hand,"
157,BOOK I.,Filch'd from a maypole.--]
158,BOOK I.,
159,BOOK I.,The case was this: These sons of thunder
160,BOOK I.,Took a plump wench amongst their plunder.
161,BOOK I.,"A red-nos'd priest came hobbling after,"
162,BOOK I.,With presents to redeem his daughter;
163,BOOK I.,"Like a poor supplicant did stand,"
164,BOOK I.,With an old garland in his hand
165,BOOK I.,"Filch'd from a May-pole, and to boot"
166,BOOK I.,A constable's short staff lugg'd out.
167,BOOK I.,"These things, he told the chief that kept her,"
168,BOOK I.,Were his old master's crown and sceptre;
169,BOOK I.,"Then to the captains made a speech,"
170,BOOK I.,"And to the brothers joint, and each:"
171,BOOK I.,
172,BOOK I.,"Ye Grecian constables so stout,"
173,BOOK I.,May you all live to see Troy out;
174,BOOK I.,"And when you've pull'd it to the ground,"
175,BOOK I.,May you get home both safe and sound!
176,BOOK I.,"Was Jove but half the friend that I am,"
177,BOOK I.,You quickly should demolish Priam;
178,BOOK I.,"But, since the town his godship spares,"
179,BOOK I.,I'll help you all I can with pray'rs.
180,BOOK I.,"For my part, if you'll but restore"
181,BOOK I.,"My daughter, I'll desire no more."
182,BOOK I.,You'll hardly guess the many shifts
183,BOOK I.,I made to raise you all these gifts.
184,BOOK I.,"If presents can't for favour plead,"
185,BOOK I.,Then let your pity take the lead.
186,BOOK I.,"Should you refuse, Apollo swears,"
187,BOOK I.,"He'll come himself, and lug your ears."
188,BOOK I.,
189,BOOK I.,The Grecians by their shouts declare
190,BOOK I.,Th' old gentleman spoke very fair;
191,BOOK I.,"They swore respect to him was due,"
192,BOOK I.,And he should have his daughter too:
193,BOOK I.,"For he had brought, to piece the quarrel,"
194,BOOK I.,Of Yarmouth herrings half a barrel.
195,BOOK I.,No wonder then their mouths should water
196,BOOK I.,More for his herrings than his daughter.
197,BOOK I.,"But Agamemnon, who with care"
198,BOOK I.,"Had well examin'd all her ware,"
199,BOOK I.,And guess'd that neither Troy nor Greece
200,BOOK I.,"Could furnish such another piece,"
201,BOOK I.,Roars out: You make a cursed jargon!
202,BOOK I.,But take me with ye ere you bargain:
203,BOOK I.,"My turn's to speak; and as for you, Sir,"
204,BOOK I.,"This journey you may chance to rue, Sir:"
205,BOOK I.,Nor shall your cap and gilded stick
206,BOOK I.,"Preserve your buttocks from a kick,"
207,BOOK I.,"Unless you show your heels, and so"
208,BOOK I.,Escape the rage of my great toe.
209,BOOK I.,What priest besides thyself e'er grumbled
210,BOOK I.,To have his daughter tightly tumbled?
211,BOOK I.,"Then don't provoke me by your stay,"
212,BOOK I.,"But get you gone, Sir, whilst you may."
213,BOOK I.,"I love the girl, and sha'nt part with her"
214,BOOK I.,Till age has made her hide whit-leather.
215,BOOK I.,"I'll keep her till I can no more,"
216,BOOK I.,"And then I will not turn her o'er,"
217,BOOK I.,"But with my goods at Argos land her,"
218,BOOK I.,"And to my own old mansion hand her,"
219,BOOK I.,"Where she shall card, and spin, and make"
220,BOOK I.,The bed which she has help'd to shake.
221,BOOK I.,"From all such blubb'ring rogues, depend on't,"
222,BOOK I.,"I'll hold her safe, so mark the end on't."
223,BOOK I.,"Then cease thy canting sobs and groans,"
224,BOOK I.,And scamper ere I break thy bones.
225,BOOK I.,
226,BOOK I.,"Away then sneak'd the harmless wizard,"
227,BOOK I.,"Grumbling confoundedly i' th' gizzard,"
228,BOOK I.,"And, as in doleful dumps he pass'd,"
229,BOOK I.,Look'd sharp for fear of being thrash'd.
230,BOOK I.,"But out of harm's way when he got,"
231,BOOK I.,To Phœbus he set up his throat:
232,BOOK I.,"Smintheus, Latona's son and heir,"
233,BOOK I.,"Cilla's chief justice, hear my pray'r!"
234,BOOK I.,"Thou link-boy of the world, that dost"
235,BOOK I.,"In Chrysa's village rule the roast,"
236,BOOK I.,"And know'st the measure, <i>inter nos</i>,"
237,BOOK I.,"Of ev'ry wench in Tenedos,"
238,BOOK I.,"Rat-catcher general of heaven,"
239,BOOK I.,Remember how much flesh I've given
240,BOOK I.,To stay your stomach; beef and mutton
241,BOOK I.,I never fail'd your shrine to put on;
242,BOOK I.,"And, as I knew you lik'd them dearly,"
243,BOOK I.,I hung a dozen garlands yearly
244,BOOK I.,"About your church, nor charg'd the warden"
245,BOOK I.,Or overseers a single farthing;
246,BOOK I.,But paid the charge and swept the gallery
247,BOOK I.,Out of my own poor lousy salary.
248,BOOK I.,"This I have done, I'll make't appear,"
249,BOOK I.,For more than five-and-fifty year.
250,BOOK I.,In recompense I now insist
251,BOOK I.,The Grecians feel thy toe and fist;
252,BOOK I.,For sure thou canst not grudge the least
253,BOOK I.,To vindicate so good a priest.
254,BOOK I.,
255,BOOK I.,"Thus Chrysis pray'd: in dreadful ire,"
256,BOOK I.,The carrot-pated god took fire;
257,BOOK I.,"But ere he stirr'd he bent his bow,"
258,BOOK I.,"That he might have the less to do,"
259,BOOK I.,Resolv'd before he did begin
260,BOOK I.,To souse 'em whilst his hand was in.
261,BOOK I.,"Fierce as he mov'd the Greeks to find,"
262,BOOK I.,He made a rumbling noise behind;
263,BOOK I.,His guts with grumbling surely never
264,BOOK I.,"Could roar so loud--it was his quiver,"
265,BOOK I.,"Which, as he trotted, with a thwack"
266,BOOK I.,Rattled against his raw-bone back.
267,BOOK I.,"In darkness he his body shrouds,"
268,BOOK I.,By making up a cloak of clouds.
269,BOOK I.,"But, when he came within their view,"
270,BOOK I.,Twang went his trusty bow of yew:
271,BOOK I.,"He first began with dogs and mules,"
272,BOOK I.,And next demolish'd knaves and fools.
273,BOOK I.,"Nine nights he never went to sleep,"
274,BOOK I.,And knock'd 'em down like rotten sheep;
275,BOOK I.,"And would have sous'd 'em all, but Juno,"
276,BOOK I.,"A scolding b----h as any you know,"
277,BOOK I.,Came and explain'd the matter fully
278,BOOK I.,"To Thetis' son, the Grecian bully,"
279,BOOK I.,Who ran full speed to summon all
280,BOOK I.,The common council to the hall.
281,BOOK I.,"When seated, with a solemn look"
282,BOOK I.,"Achilles rose, and thus he spoke:"
283,BOOK I.,
284,BOOK I.,"Neighbours, can any Grecian say"
285,BOOK I.,We ought not all to run away
286,BOOK I.,From this curst place without delay?
287,BOOK I.,Else soon our best and bravest cocks
288,BOOK I.,Will be destroy'd by plague or pox.
289,BOOK I.,"We cannot long, though Jove doth back us,"
290,BOOK I.,"Resist, whilst two such foes attack us."
291,BOOK I.,I think 'tis time to spare the few
292,BOOK I.,Our broils have left; but what think you?
293,BOOK I.,A cunning man perhaps may tell us
294,BOOK I.,The reason why this plague befel us
295,BOOK I.,"Or an old woman, that can dream,"
296,BOOK I.,May help us out in this extreme;
297,BOOK I.,"For dreams, if rightly you attend 'em,"
298,BOOK I.,"Are true, when Jove thinks fit to send 'em."
299,BOOK I.,Thus may we form some judgment what
300,BOOK I.,This same Apollo would be at;
301,BOOK I.,"Whether he mauls each wicked sinner,"
302,BOOK I.,Because a mighty pimping dinner
303,BOOK I.,He often had but then he knew
304,BOOK I.,That we had damn'd short commons too.
305,BOOK I.,"If 'tis for that he makes such stir,"
306,BOOK I.,He's not the man I took him for:
307,BOOK I.,"But, as I've reason for my fears,"
308,BOOK I.,I vote to pay him all arrears.
309,BOOK I.,"Therefore let such a man be found,"
310,BOOK I.,"Either above or under ground,"
311,BOOK I.,To tell us quickly how we may
312,BOOK I.,"In proper terms begin to pray,"
313,BOOK I.,"That he may ease us of these curses,"
314,BOOK I.,And stay at home and mind his horses--
315,BOOK I.,Much better bus'ness for the spark
316,BOOK I.,Than shooting Grecians in the dark.
317,BOOK I.,
318,BOOK I.,"He said, and squatting on his breech,"
319,BOOK I.,"Calchas rose up, and look'd on each:"
320,BOOK I.,With caution he began to speak
321,BOOK I.,A speech compos'd of purest Greek.
322,BOOK I.,"He was a wizard, and could cast"
323,BOOK I.,A figure to find out things past;
324,BOOK I.,"And things to come he could foretel,"
325,BOOK I.,Almost as well as Sydrophel.
326,BOOK I.,The diff'rent languages he knew
327,BOOK I.,"Of every kind of bird that flew,"
328,BOOK I.,Each word could construe that they spoke.
329,BOOK I.,"Or screech-owl's scream, or raven's croak,"
330,BOOK I.,"And, by a science most profound,"
331,BOOK I.,Distinguish rotten eggs from sound.
332,BOOK I.,When first the Grecians mann'd their boats
333,BOOK I.,"To sail and cut the Trojans' throats,"
334,BOOK I.,"Safely to steer 'em through the tide,"
335,BOOK I.,They chose this wizard for their guide.
336,BOOK I.,"As slow as clock-work he arose,"
337,BOOK I.,Then with his fingers wip'd his nose:
338,BOOK I.,"Dubious to speak or hold his tongue,"
339,BOOK I.,His words betwixt his teeth were hung:
340,BOOK I.,"But, having shook 'em from his jaws,"
341,BOOK I.,"As dogs shake weasels from their nose,"
342,BOOK I.,"Away they came both loud and clear,"
343,BOOK I.,"And told his mind, as you shall hear:"
344,BOOK I.,
345,BOOK I.,"Thou that art Jove's respected friend,"
346,BOOK I.,"To what I speak be sure attend,"
347,BOOK I.,"And in a twinkling shalt thou know,"
348,BOOK I.,"Why Phœbus smokes the Grecians so,"
349,BOOK I.,"But promise, should the chief attack me,"
350,BOOK I.,That thou my bully-rock wilt back me;
351,BOOK I.,"Because I know things must come out,"
352,BOOK I.,Will gripe him to the very <i>gut</i>.
353,BOOK I.,"These monarchs are so proud and haughty,"
354,BOOK I.,"Subjects can't tell them when they're faulty,"
355,BOOK I.,"Because, though now their fury drops,"
356,BOOK I.,Somehow or other out it pops.
357,BOOK I.,"And this remember whilst you live,"
358,BOOK I.,"When kings can't punish, they'll forgive."
359,BOOK I.,
360,BOOK I.,"Achilles thus: Old cock, speak out,"
361,BOOK I.,Speak freely without fear or doubt.
362,BOOK I.,"Smite my old pot-lid! but, so long"
363,BOOK I.,As I draw breath amidst this throng.
364,BOOK I.,The bloodiest cur in all the crew
365,BOOK I.,Sha'n't dare so much as bark at you:
366,BOOK I.,"Not e'en the chief, so grum and tall,"
367,BOOK I.,Who sits two steps above us all.
368,BOOK I.,
369,BOOK I.,"These words the doubtful conj'ror cheer,"
370,BOOK I.,Who then proceeded without fear:
371,BOOK I.,"To th' gods you never play'd the thief,"
372,BOOK I.,But paid them well with tripe or beef;
373,BOOK I.,But 'tis our chief provok'd Apollo
374,BOOK I.,With this curst plague our camp to follow
375,BOOK I.,"Because his priest was vilely us'd,"
376,BOOK I.,"His daughter kiss'd, himself abus'd."
377,BOOK I.,The curate's pray's caus'd these disorders:
378,BOOK I.,Gods fight for men in holy orders.
379,BOOK I.,"Nor will he from his purpose flinch,"
380,BOOK I.,"Nor will his godship budge one inch,"
381,BOOK I.,"But without mercy, great and small,"
382,BOOK I.,"Will never cease to sweat us all,"
383,BOOK I.,"If Agamemnon doth not send her,"
384,BOOK I.,With cooks and statesmen to attend her.
385,BOOK I.,Then let's in haste the girl restore
386,BOOK I.,"Without a ransom; and, what's more,"
387,BOOK I.,"Let's rams, and goats, and oxen give,"
388,BOOK I.,That priests and gods may let us live.
389,BOOK I.,
390,BOOK I.,"Ready to burst with vengeful ire,"
391,BOOK I.,"That made his bloodshot eyes strike fire,"
392,BOOK I.,"Atrides, with an angry scowl,"
393,BOOK I.,"Replies, The devil fetch your soul!"
394,BOOK I.,"I've a great mind, you lousy wizard,"
395,BOOK I.,To lay my fist across your mazzard.
396,BOOK I.,"Son of an ugly squinting bitch,"
397,BOOK I.,Pray who the pox made you a witch?
398,BOOK I.,"I don't believe, you mongrel dog,"
399,BOOK I.,You ken a handsaw from a hog;
400,BOOK I.,"Nor know, although you thus dare flounce,"
401,BOOK I.,How many f----s will make an ounce;
402,BOOK I.,"And yet, an imp, can always see"
403,BOOK I.,"Some mischief cooking up for me,"
404,BOOK I.,"And think, because you are a priest,"
405,BOOK I.,You safely may with captains jest.
406,BOOK I.,"But I forewarn thee, shun the stroke,"
407,BOOK I.,Nor dare my mighty rage provoke.
408,BOOK I.,A pretty fellow thou! to teach
409,BOOK I.,"Our men to murmur at thy speech,"
410,BOOK I.,"Tell lies as thick as you can pack 'em,"
411,BOOK I.,And bring your wooden gods to back 'em
412,BOOK I.,And all because a girl I keep
413,BOOK I.,"For exercise, to make me sleep."
414,BOOK I.,"Besides, the wench does all things neatly,"
415,BOOK I.,And <i>handles</i> my <i>affairs</i> completely.
416,BOOK I.,"She hems, marks linen, and she <i>stitches</i>,"
417,BOOK I.,"And mends my doublet, hose, and breeches,"
418,BOOK I.,"My Clytemnestra well I love,"
419,BOOK I.,"But not so well as her, by Jove!"
420,BOOK I.,"Yet, since you say we suffer slaughter"
421,BOOK I.,"Because I kiss this parson's daughter,"
422,BOOK I.,"Then go she must; I'll let her go,"
423,BOOK I.,Since the cross gods will have it so;
424,BOOK I.,"Rather than Phœbus thus shall drive,"
425,BOOK I.,"And slay the people all alive,"
426,BOOK I.,"From this dear loving wench I'll part,"
427,BOOK I.,The only comfort of my heart.
428,BOOK I.,"But, since I must resign for Greece,"
429,BOOK I.,I shall expect as good a <i>piece</i>:
430,BOOK I.,"'Tis a great loss, and by my soul"
431,BOOK I.,All Greece shall join to make me whole!
432,BOOK I.,"Don't think that I, of all that fought,"
433,BOOK I.,Will take a broken pate for nought.
434,BOOK I.,
435,BOOK I.,"Achilles, starting from his breech,"
436,BOOK I.,"Replies, By Jove, a pretty speech!"
437,BOOK I.,Think'st thou the troops will in her stead
438,BOOK I.,Send what they got with broken head;
439,BOOK I.,Or that we shall esteem you right in
440,BOOK I.,Purloining what we earn'd by fighting?
441,BOOK I.,"You may with bullying face demand,"
442,BOOK I.,But who the pox will understand?
443,BOOK I.,"If thou for plunder look'st, my boy,"
444,BOOK I.,Enough of that there is in Troy:
445,BOOK I.,"Her apple-stalls we down may pull,"
446,BOOK I.,And then we'll stuff thy belly full.
447,BOOK I.,
448,BOOK I.,"The chief replies: For you, Achilles,"
449,BOOK I.,I care not two-pence; but my will is
450,BOOK I.,"Not to submit to be so serv'd,"
451,BOOK I.,And thou lie warm whilst I am starv'd.
452,BOOK I.,"Though thou in battle mak'st brave work,"
453,BOOK I.,"Can beat the devil, pope, and Turk,"
454,BOOK I.,"With Spaniards, Hollanders, and French,"
455,BOOK I.,I won't for that give up my wench:
456,BOOK I.,"Nor shall I, Mr. Bluff, d'ye see,"
457,BOOK I.,Resign my girl to pleasure thee.
458,BOOK I.,"Let something be produc'd to view,"
459,BOOK I.,"Which I may have of her in lieu,"
460,BOOK I.,"Something that's noble, great and good,"
461,BOOK I.,Worthy a prince of royal blood;
462,BOOK I.,"Just such another I should wish her,"
463,BOOK I.,As sev'n years since was Kitty Fisher;
464,BOOK I.,"Or else I will, since you provoke,"
465,BOOK I.,At all your prizes have a stroke;

467,BOOK I.,"Or thine or Ajax', if I please."
468,BOOK I.,"The man that's hurt may bawl and roar,"
469,BOOK I.,"And swear, but he can do no more."
470,BOOK I.,"But this some other time may do,"
471,BOOK I.,I must go launch a sand-barge now:
472,BOOK I.,"Victuals and cooks I must take care,"
473,BOOK I.,"With oars and pilots, to prepare;"
474,BOOK I.,"See the ropes tarr'd, the bottom mended,"
475,BOOK I.,And the old sails well piec'd and bended
476,BOOK I.,"Then put the wench on board the boat,"
477,BOOK I.,"Attended by some man of note,"
478,BOOK I.,"By Creta's chief, or, if he misses,"
479,BOOK I.,"By Ajax, or by sly Ulysses;"
480,BOOK I.,"Or, if I please, I'll make you skip"
481,BOOK I.,"Aboard, as captain of the ship."
482,BOOK I.,We make no doubt but you with ease
483,BOOK I.,His angry godship may appease;
484,BOOK I.,"Or else your goggle eyes, that fright us,"
485,BOOK I.,May scare him so he'll cease to smite us.
486,BOOK I.,
487,BOOK I.,You would have sworn this mortal twitch
488,BOOK I.,"Had given old Peleus' son the itch,"
489,BOOK I.,"So hard he scratch'd; at last found vent,"
490,BOOK I.,And back to him this answer sent:
491,BOOK I.,
492,BOOK I.,"Thou wretch, to all true hearts a stain,"
493,BOOK I.,Thou damn'd infernal rogue in grain!
494,BOOK I.,"Thou greater hypocrite than G-ml-y,"
495,BOOK I.,Thou dirtier dog than Jeremy L----y!
496,BOOK I.,"Whose deeds, like thine, will ever be"
497,BOOK I.,A scandal to nobility;
498,BOOK I.,From this good day I hope no chief
499,BOOK I.,"Will fight thy broils, or eat thy beef."
500,BOOK I.,"How canst thou hope thy men will stand,"
501,BOOK I.,When under such a rogue's command?
502,BOOK I.,What bus'ness I to fight thy battle?
503,BOOK I.,The Trojans never stole my cattle.
504,BOOK I.,"My farm, secur'd by rocks and sands,"
505,BOOK I.,Was safe from all their thieving bands.
506,BOOK I.,"My steeds fed safe, both grey and dapple;"
507,BOOK I.,Nor could they steal a single apple
508,BOOK I.,From any orchard did belong
509,BOOK I.,"To me, my fences were so strong."
510,BOOK I.,I kept off all such sons of bitches
511,BOOK I.,With quick-set hedges fac'd with ditches.
512,BOOK I.,"Our farm can all good things supply,"
513,BOOK I.,"Our men can box, and so can I."
514,BOOK I.,"Hither we came, 'tis shame I'm sure,"
515,BOOK I.,"To fight, for what? an arrant whore!"
516,BOOK I.,A pretty story this to tell.
517,BOOK I.,"Instead of being treated well,"
518,BOOK I.,"As a reward for all our blows,"
519,BOOK I.,We're kick'd about by your dog's nose.
520,BOOK I.,"And dar'st thou think to seize my plunder,"
521,BOOK I.,"For which I made the battle thunder,"
522,BOOK I.,And men and horses truckle under?
523,BOOK I.,"No! since it was the Grecians' gift,"
524,BOOK I.,To keep it I shall make a shift.
525,BOOK I.,What wouldst thou have? thou hadst the <i>best</i>
526,BOOK I.,"Of every thing; nay, 'tis no jest:"
527,BOOK I.,"But you take care to leave, I see,"
528,BOOK I.,The fighting trade to fools like me.
529,BOOK I.,"In this you show the statesman's skill,"
530,BOOK I.,To let fools fight whilst you sit still.
531,BOOK I.,"First I'm humbugg'd with some poor toy,"
532,BOOK I.,"Then clapp'd o' th' back, and call'd brave boy."
533,BOOK I.,"This shall no more hold water, friend:"

535,BOOK I.,"When I go, and my men to boots,"
536,BOOK I.,I leave thee then a king of clouts.
537,BOOK I.,
538,BOOK I.,"The general gave him tit for tat,"
539,BOOK I.,"And answer'd, cocking first his hat:"
540,BOOK I.,"Go, and be hang'd, you blust'ring whelp,"
541,BOOK I.,Pray who the murrain wants your help?
542,BOOK I.,"When you are gone, I know there are"
543,BOOK I.,"Col'nels sufficient for the war,"
544,BOOK I.,"Militia bucks that know no fears,"

551,BOOK I.,"Art thou so stupid, canst not ken,"
552,BOOK I.,"The gods, that ev'ry thing can see,"
553,BOOK I.,Give strength to bears as well as thee?
554,BOOK I.,"Of all Jove's sons, a bastard host,"
555,BOOK I.,"For reasons good, I hate thee most."
556,BOOK I.,"Prithee be packing; thou'rt not fit,"
557,BOOK I.,"Or here to stand, or there to sit:"
558,BOOK I.,"In your own parish kick your scrubs,"
559,BOOK I.,They're taught to bear such kind of rubs;
560,BOOK I.,"But, for my part, I scorn the help"
561,BOOK I.,"Of such a noisy, bullying whelp:"
562,BOOK I.,"Go therefore, friend, and learn at school,"
563,BOOK I.,"First to obey, and then to rule."
564,BOOK I.,"The gods they say for Chryseis send,"
565,BOOK I.,And to restore her I intend;
566,BOOK I.,"But look what follows, Mr. Bully!"
567,BOOK I.,"See if I don't convince thee fully,"
568,BOOK I.,That thy bluff wench with sandy hair
569,BOOK I.,The loss I suffer shall repair:
570,BOOK I.,I'll let thee feel what 'tis to be
571,BOOK I.,A rival to a chief like me;
572,BOOK I.,"That thou and all these folks may know,"
573,BOOK I.,Great men are only subject to
574,BOOK I.,"The gods, or right or wrong they do."
575,BOOK I.,
576,BOOK I.,"Had you but seen Achilles fret it,"
577,BOOK I.,I think you never could forget it;
578,BOOK I.,"A sight so dreadful ne'er was seen,"
579,BOOK I.,He sweat for very rage and spleen:
580,BOOK I.,Long was he balanc'd at both ends;
581,BOOK I.,"When reason mounted, rage descends;"
582,BOOK I.,The last commanded sword lug out;
583,BOOK I.,The first advis'd him not to do't.
584,BOOK I.,"With half-drawn weapon fierce he stood,"
585,BOOK I.,Eager to let the general blood;
586,BOOK I.,"When Pallas, swift descending down,"
587,BOOK I.,Lent him a knock upon the crown;
588,BOOK I.,"Then roar'd as loud as she could yelp,"
589,BOOK I.,"Lugging his ears, 'Tis I, you whelp!"
590,BOOK I.,"Now Mrs. Juno, 'cause they both"
591,BOOK I.,"Were fav'rites, was exceeding loth"
592,BOOK I.,To have 'em quarrel; so she sent
593,BOOK I.,"This wench all mischief to prevent,"
594,BOOK I.,"And, to obstruct her being seen,"
595,BOOK I.,Lent her a cloud to make a screen.
596,BOOK I.,
597,BOOK I.,Pelides wonder'd who could be
598,BOOK I.,"So bold, and turn'd about to see:"
599,BOOK I.,"He knew the twinkling of her eyes,"
600,BOOK I.,"And loud as he could bawl, he cries,"
601,BOOK I.,Goddess of Wisdom! pray what weather
602,BOOK I.,Has blown your goatskin doublet hither?
603,BOOK I.,"Howe'er, thou com'st quite opportune"
604,BOOK I.,To see how basely I'm run down;
605,BOOK I.,Thou com'st most <i>à-propos incog.</i>
606,BOOK I.,To see how I will trim this dog:
607,BOOK I.,"For, by this trusty blade, his life"
608,BOOK I.,Or mine shall end this furious strife!
609,BOOK I.,
610,BOOK I.,"To whom reply'd the blue-ey'd Pallas,"
611,BOOK I.,I come to save thee from the gallows:
612,BOOK I.,"Thou'rt surely either mad or drunk,"
613,BOOK I.,To threaten murder for a punk:
614,BOOK I.,"Prithee, now let this passion cool;"
615,BOOK I.,For once be guided by a fool.
616,BOOK I.,"From heav'n I sous'd me down like thunder,"
617,BOOK I.,To keep your boiling passion under;
618,BOOK I.,"For white-arm'd Juno bid me say,"
619,BOOK I.,"Let reason now thy passion sway,"
620,BOOK I.,And give it vent some other day;
621,BOOK I.,"Sheathe thy cheese-toaster in its case,"
622,BOOK I.,But call him scoundrel to his face.
623,BOOK I.,"To Juno both alike are dear,"
624,BOOK I.,"And both alike to me, I'll swear."
625,BOOK I.,In a short time the silly whelp
626,BOOK I.,Will give a guinea for thy help;
627,BOOK I.,"Only just now revenge forbear,"
628,BOOK I.,And be content to scold and swear.
629,BOOK I.,
630,BOOK I.,Achilles thus: With ears and eyes
631,BOOK I.,"I mind thee, goddess bold and wise!"
632,BOOK I.,"'Tis hard; but since 'tis your command,"
633,BOOK I.,Depend upon't I'll hold my hand--
634,BOOK I.,"Knowing, if your advice I take,"
635,BOOK I.,Some day a recompense you'll make:
636,BOOK I.,"Besides, of all the heavenly crew,"
637,BOOK I.,I pay the most regard to you.
638,BOOK I.,"This said, he rams into the sheath"
639,BOOK I.,His rusty instrument of death.
640,BOOK I.,
641,BOOK I.,"(Pallas then instantly took flight,"
642,BOOK I.,"Astride her broom-stick, out of sight;"
643,BOOK I.,"And ere you could repeat twice seven,"
644,BOOK I.,Had reach'd the outward gate of heaven.)
645,BOOK I.,"His gizzard still was mighty hot,"
646,BOOK I.,And boil'd like porridge in a pot;
647,BOOK I.,"Atrides he did so randan,"
648,BOOK I.,He call'd him all but gentleman;
649,BOOK I.,"By Jove, says he, thou'rt always drunk,"
650,BOOK I.,And always squabbling for a punk.
651,BOOK I.,Thou dog in face! thou deer in heart!
652,BOOK I.,Thou call'd a fighter! thou a f--t!
653,BOOK I.,"When didst thou e'er in ambush lie,"
654,BOOK I.,Unless to seize some mutton pie?
655,BOOK I.,"And there you're safe, because you can"
656,BOOK I.,Run faster than the baker's man.
657,BOOK I.,"When fighting comes you bid us fight,"
658,BOOK I.,And claim the greatest profit by't.
659,BOOK I.,"Great Agamemnon safer goes,"
660,BOOK I.,To rob his friends than plunder foes:
661,BOOK I.,And he who dares to contradict
662,BOOK I.,Is sure to have his pockets pick'd:
663,BOOK I.,"Hear then, you pilfering dirty cur,"
664,BOOK I.,Whose thieving makes so great a stir;
665,BOOK I.,And let the crowd about us hear
666,BOOK I.,"What I by this same truncheon swear,"
667,BOOK I.,Which to the tree whereon it grew
668,BOOK I.,"Will never join, nor I with you,"
669,BOOK I.,The devil fetch me if I do!
670,BOOK I.,"Therefore, I say, by this same stick,"
671,BOOK I.,Expect no more I'll come i' th' nick
672,BOOK I.,"Your luggs to save: let Hector souse ye,"
673,BOOK I.,And with his trusty broomshaft douse ye.
674,BOOK I.,"God help us all, I know thou'lt say,"
675,BOOK I.,"Then stare and gape, and run away:"
676,BOOK I.,"All this will happen, I conjecture,"
677,BOOK I.,The very next time you see Hector;
678,BOOK I.,"And then thyself thou'lt hang, I trow,"
679,BOOK I.,For using great Achilles so.
680,BOOK I.,"This said, his truncheon, gilded all"
681,BOOK I.,"Like ginger-bread upon a stall,"
682,BOOK I.,"Around the top and bottom too,"
683,BOOK I.,Slap bang upon the floor he threw.
684,BOOK I.,"His wrath Atrides could not hold,"
685,BOOK I.,"But cock'd his mouth again to scold,"
686,BOOK I.,"And talk'd away at such a rate,"
687,BOOK I.,"He distanc'd hard-mouth'd scolding Kate,"
688,BOOK I.,The orator of Billingsgate.
689,BOOK I.,
690,BOOK I.,Whilst thus they rant and scold and swear
691,BOOK I.,Old Square-toes rises from his chair;
692,BOOK I.,"With honey words your ears he'd sooth,"
693,BOOK I.,Pomatum was not half so smooth.
694,BOOK I.,Nestor had fill'd the highest stations
695,BOOK I.,For almost three whole generations;
696,BOOK I.,"At ev'ry meeting took the chair,"
697,BOOK I.,"Had been a dozen times lord-mayor,"
698,BOOK I.,"And, what you hardly credit will,"
699,BOOK I.,Remain'd a fine old Grecian still.
700,BOOK I.,"On him with gaping jaws they look,"
701,BOOK I.,Whilst the old coney-catcher spoke:
702,BOOK I.,"To Greece 'twill be a burning shame,"
703,BOOK I.,"But to the Trojans special game,"
704,BOOK I.,"That our best leaders, men so stout,"
705,BOOK I.,For whores and rogues should thus fall out:
706,BOOK I.,"Young men the old may treat as mules,"
707,BOOK I.,We know full well young men are fools;
708,BOOK I.,"Therefore, to lay the case before ye"
709,BOOK I.,"Plain as I can, I'll tell a story:"
710,BOOK I.,"I once a set of fellows knew,"
711,BOOK I.,"All hearts of oak, and backs of yew:"
712,BOOK I.,"To look for such would be in vain,"
713,BOOK I.,I ne'er shall see the like again.
714,BOOK I.,"Though bruis'd from head to foot they fought on,"
715,BOOK I.,Pirithous was himself a Broughton.
716,BOOK I.,"Bold Dryas was as hard as steel,"
717,BOOK I.,His knuckles would make Buckhurst feel;
718,BOOK I.,"And strong-back'd Theseus, though a sailor,"
719,BOOK I.,Would single-handed beat the Nailor.
720,BOOK I.,"Great Polyphemus too I brag on,"
721,BOOK I.,He fought and kick'd like Wantley's dragon;
722,BOOK I.,And Cineus often would for fun
723,BOOK I.,Make constables and watchmen run.
724,BOOK I.,"Such were my cronies, rogues in buff,"
725,BOOK I.,Who taught me how to kick and cuff.
726,BOOK I.,With these the boar stood little chance;
727,BOOK I.,They made the four-legg'd Centaurs prance.
728,BOOK I.,"Now these brave boys, these hearts of oak,"
729,BOOK I.,Were all attention when I spoke;
730,BOOK I.,And listen'd to my fine oration
731,BOOK I.,Like Whitfield's gaping congregation:
732,BOOK I.,"Though I was young, they thought me wise;"
733,BOOK I.,You sure may now with me advise.
734,BOOK I.,"Atrides, don't Briseis seek;"
735,BOOK I.,"For, if you do, depend, each Greek,"
736,BOOK I.,"The dastard rogue as well as brave,"
737,BOOK I.,Will say our king's both fool and knave.
738,BOOK I.,"The want of brains is no great shame,"
739,BOOK I.,'Cause nature there is most to blame;
740,BOOK I.,"But this plain fact by all is known,"
741,BOOK I.,"If you're a rogue, the fault's your own."
742,BOOK I.,"Achilles, don't you play the fool,"
743,BOOK I.,And snub the king; for he must rule.
744,BOOK I.,"Thou art in fight the first, I grant;"
745,BOOK I.,"As brave as Mars, or John-a-Gaunt:"
746,BOOK I.,"But then you must allow one thing,"
747,BOOK I.,No man should scold and huff a king.
748,BOOK I.,"Matters you know are just this length,"
749,BOOK I.,"He has got pow'r, and you have strength"
750,BOOK I.,Of each let's take a proper sup
751,BOOK I.,To make a useful mixture up.
752,BOOK I.,"Do you, Atrides, strive to ease"
753,BOOK I.,Your heart; this bully I'll appease.
754,BOOK I.,I'd rather give five hundred pound
755,BOOK I.,Than have Pelides quit the ground.
756,BOOK I.,"Bravo! old boy! the king replies,"
757,BOOK I.,I swear my vet'ran's wondrous wise:
758,BOOK I.,But that snap-dragon won't submit
759,BOOK I.,"To laws, unless he thinks 'em fit;"
760,BOOK I.,"Because he can the Trojans swinge,"
761,BOOK I.,He fancies I to him should cringe:
762,BOOK I.,"But I, in spite of all his frumps,"
763,BOOK I.,Shall make him know I'm king of trumps.
764,BOOK I.,
765,BOOK I.,Achilles quickly broke the thread
766,BOOK I.,Of this fine speech; and thus he said:
767,BOOK I.,
768,BOOK I.,"Now, smite me, but I well deserv'd"
769,BOOK I.,"To be so us'd, when first I serv'd"
770,BOOK I.,So great a rogue as you; but damn me
771,BOOK I.,If you another day shall flam me:
772,BOOK I.,"Seize my Briseis, if you list,"
773,BOOK I.,I've pass'd my word I won't resist;
774,BOOK I.,"Safely then do it, for no more,"
775,BOOK I.,"For any woman, wife or whore,"
776,BOOK I.,Achilles boxes; but take care
777,BOOK I.,Your scoundrels steal no other ware:
778,BOOK I.,"No more Achilles dare t'affront,"
779,BOOK I.,"Lest he should call thee to account,"
780,BOOK I.,"And the next scurvy squabble close,"
781,BOOK I.,By wringing off thy snotty nose.
782,BOOK I.,
783,BOOK I.,"This Billingsgate affair being o'er,"
784,BOOK I.,Sullen they turn'd 'em to the door.
785,BOOK I.,"Achilles in a hurry went,"
786,BOOK I.,And sat down sulky in his tent:
787,BOOK I.,"Patroclus, as a friend should do,"
788,BOOK I.,Both grumbled and look'd sulky too.
789,BOOK I.,Mean time Atrides fitted out
790,BOOK I.,From Puddle Dock a smuggling-boat.
791,BOOK I.,On deck Miss Chryseis took her stand;
792,BOOK I.,Ulysses had the chief command.
793,BOOK I.,"The off'rings in the hold they stuff'd,"
794,BOOK I.,"Then, all sails set, away they luff'd."
795,BOOK I.,The chol'ric chief doth next essay
796,BOOK I.,The soldiers' filth to wash away;
797,BOOK I.,"A cart and horse to every tent,"
798,BOOK I.,He with a noisy bellman sent:
799,BOOK I.,"The bell did signify, You must"
800,BOOK I.,Without delay bring out your dust:
801,BOOK I.,"Then made 'em stand upon the shore,"
802,BOOK I.,And wash their dirty limbs all o'er:
803,BOOK I.,"Next, by advice of Doctor Grimstone,"
804,BOOK I.,"He rubb'd their mangey joints with brimstone,"
805,BOOK I.,"Because, when first they sally'd forth,"
806,BOOK I.,Some mercenaries from the north
807,BOOK I.,"Had brought a queer distemper, which"
808,BOOK I.,The learned doctors call'd the itch.
809,BOOK I.,He next begins to cut the throats
810,BOOK I.,"Of bulls, and sheep, and lambs, and goats;"
811,BOOK I.,"The legs and loins in order laid,"
812,BOOK I.,To Phœbus all his share is paid:
813,BOOK I.,"Apollo, as the smoke arose,"
814,BOOK I.,Snuff'd ev'ry atom up his nose;
815,BOOK I.,"And, rather than they would provoke him,"
816,BOOK I.,They sent him smoke enough to choke him.
817,BOOK I.,"Still in the midst of all this coil,"
818,BOOK I.,Atrides felt his ewer boil:
819,BOOK I.,"Talthybius and Euribates,"
820,BOOK I.,"Two ticket porters, did await his"
821,BOOK I.,"Dread will, to carry goods and chattels,"
822,BOOK I.,Or run with messages in battles:
823,BOOK I.,"To these he speaks:--Ye scoundrels two,"
824,BOOK I.,What I command observe ye do;
825,BOOK I.,"Run to Achilles' tent, take heed,"
826,BOOK I.,And bring away his wench with speed;
827,BOOK I.,"Tell him you're order'd to attend her,"
828,BOOK I.,And I expect he'll quickly send her;
829,BOOK I.,Else with a file of musqueteers
830,BOOK I.,I'll beat his tent about his ears.
831,BOOK I.,

879,BOOK I.,Kept squinting backward to his tent.
880,BOOK I.,
881,BOOK I.,"Now, when the buxom wench was gone,"
882,BOOK I.,"What think you doth this lubber-loon,"
883,BOOK I.,"But, when he found no mortal near him,"
884,BOOK I.,"Roar so, 'twould do you good to hear him;"
885,BOOK I.,And hanging his great jolter head
886,BOOK I.,"O'er the salt sea, he sobb'd, and said:"
887,BOOK I.,
888,BOOK I.,"Oh, mother! since I'm to be shot,"
889,BOOK I.,"Or some way else must go to pot,"
890,BOOK I.,"I think great Jove, if he did right,"
891,BOOK I.,Should scour my fame exceeding bright.
892,BOOK I.,'Tis quite reverse: yon brazen knave
893,BOOK I.,Has stole the plumpest wench I have;
894,BOOK I.,And in the face of all the throng
895,BOOK I.,Of constables has done me wrong.
896,BOOK I.,
897,BOOK I.,"The goddess heard him under water,"
898,BOOK I.,And ran as fast as she could patter:
899,BOOK I.,"She saw he'd almost broke his heart,"
900,BOOK I.,"And, like good mother, took his part:"
901,BOOK I.,
902,BOOK I.,"My son, I'm vext to hear thee cry;"
903,BOOK I.,"Come, tell mamma the reason why."
904,BOOK I.,"From th' bottom of his wame he sigh'd,"
905,BOOK I.,And to his mammy thus reply'd:
906,BOOK I.,
907,BOOK I.,"For what that rogue has made me cry,"
908,BOOK I.,"You know, I'm sure, as well as I:"
909,BOOK I.,"Yet since you bid me tell my story,"
910,BOOK I.,I'll whip it over in a hurry.
911,BOOK I.,"What think you that vile scoundrel's done,"
912,BOOK I.,"That Agamemnon, to your son?"
913,BOOK I.,"Because his pretty girl was gone,"
914,BOOK I.,"He must have mine, forsooth, or none."
915,BOOK I.,The Grecians gave to me this prize:
916,BOOK I.,"He huffs the Greeks, and damns their eyes."
917,BOOK I.,"We went to Thebes, and sack'd a village,"
918,BOOK I.,And brought away a world of pillage:
919,BOOK I.,"Amongst the plunder that was taken,"
920,BOOK I.,"Besides fat geese, and eggs, and bacon,"
921,BOOK I.,"We got some wenches plump and fair,"
922,BOOK I.,Of which one fell to that rogue's share:
923,BOOK I.,"But in the middle of our feast,"
924,BOOK I.,There came a hobbling red-nos'd priest;
925,BOOK I.,In a great wallet that old dreamer
926,BOOK I.,"Had brought some presents to redeem her,"
927,BOOK I.,"And made such humble supplication,"
928,BOOK I.,"Attended with a fine oration,"
929,BOOK I.,"That ev'ry Greek, except Atrides,"
930,BOOK I.,On the old hobbling parson's side is.
931,BOOK I.,"But he, of no one soul afraid,"
932,BOOK I.,Swore blood-and-oons he'd keep the maid
933,BOOK I.,"And, with an answer most uncivil,"
934,BOOK I.,Damn'd the old fellow to the devil.
935,BOOK I.,The priest walk'd home in doleful dumps
936,BOOK I.,(Like Witherington upon his stumps):
937,BOOK I.,"But, it is plain, he made a holla"
938,BOOK I.,That reach'd his loving friend Apollo;
939,BOOK I.,"For he in wrath, most furiously,"
940,BOOK I.,Began to smite us hip and thigh;
941,BOOK I.,"And had not I found out a prophet,"
942,BOOK I.,"That told us all the reason of it,"
943,BOOK I.,"Burn my old shoes, if e'er a sinner"
944,BOOK I.,Had now been left to eat a dinner;
945,BOOK I.,"But that, as sure as cits of London"
946,BOOK I.,"Oft leave their spouses' business undone,"
947,BOOK I.,And trudge away to Russel-street
948,BOOK I.,"Some little dirty whore to meet,"
949,BOOK I.,"Whilst the poor wife, to cure her dumps,"
950,BOOK I.,Works her apprentice to the stumps;
951,BOOK I.,"So sure this god, for rage or fun,"
952,BOOK I.,Had pepper'd ev'ry mother's son.
953,BOOK I.,"'Twas I, indeed, did first advise"
954,BOOK I.,"To cook him up a sacrifice,"
955,BOOK I.,And then his pardon strive to gain
956,BOOK I.,By sending home the wench again;
957,BOOK I.,For which the damn'd confounded churl
958,BOOK I.,Swore he would have my bouncing girl:
959,BOOK I.,"And I this minute, you must know,"
960,BOOK I.,"Like a great fool, have let her go:"
961,BOOK I.,"For which, no doubt, it will be said"
962,BOOK I.,Your son has got a chuckle head.
963,BOOK I.,"To Jove then go, and catch him by"
964,BOOK I.,"The hand, or foot, or knee, or thigh;"
965,BOOK I.,"Hold him but fast, and coax him well."
966,BOOK I.,"And mind you that old story tell,"
967,BOOK I.,How you of all the gods held out
968,BOOK I.,"When they once rais'd a rebel rout,"
969,BOOK I.,And brought a giant from Guildhall
970,BOOK I.,With face so grim he scar'd 'em all:
971,BOOK I.,"When once you'd got him rais'd above,"
972,BOOK I.,"And plac'd him by the side of Jove,"
973,BOOK I.,"So fast with both his hands he thunder'd,"
974,BOOK I.,"The rebels swore he'd got a hundred,"
975,BOOK I.,"Threw down the ropes they'd brought to bind 'em,"
976,BOOK I.,"And, scamp'ring, never look'd behind 'em:"
977,BOOK I.,"Tell him, for this, to drive pell mell"
978,BOOK I.,"The Grecian sons of whores to hell,"
979,BOOK I.,"That Atreus' son, that stupid fool,"
980,BOOK I.,May have no scoundrels left to rule;
981,BOOK I.,"And then he'll hang himself for spite,"
982,BOOK I.,He durst the boldest Grecian slight.
983,BOOK I.,
984,BOOK I.,"His mother's heart was almost broke,"
985,BOOK I.,To hear how dolefully he spoke:
986,BOOK I.,"But having belch'd, she thus replies,"
987,BOOK I.,The salt brine running from her eyes:
988,BOOK I.,
989,BOOK I.,"O Killey, since the Fates do stint"
990,BOOK I.,"Thy precious life, the devil's in't"
991,BOOK I.,That thou must likewise bear to boots
992,BOOK I.,"This scurvy, mangey rascal's flouts:"
993,BOOK I.,"But take thy mammy's good advice,"
994,BOOK I.,And his thee homeward in a trice;
995,BOOK I.,"Or, if thou'd rather choose to stay,"
996,BOOK I.,Don't help the dogs in any fray.
997,BOOK I.,"Depend upon't, to Jove I'll go,"
998,BOOK I.,And let him all the matter know:
999,BOOK I.,He junkets now with swarthy faces
1000,BOOK I.,"(For he, like men, has all his paces),"
1001,BOOK I.,And will continue at the feast
1002,BOOK I.,Ten or eleven days at least:
1003,BOOK I.,"Taking, like our Jamaica planters,"
1004,BOOK I.,Their fill of what our vilest ranters
1005,BOOK I.,Would puke at but these kind of beast
1006,BOOK I.,Esteem it as a noble feast;
1007,BOOK I.,I mean the breaking-up the trenches
1008,BOOK I.,"Of sooty, sweaty negro wenches"
1009,BOOK I.,"(Though most o' th' planters that thus roam,"
1010,BOOK I.,"Like Jove, have wife enough at home.)"
1011,BOOK I.,"Soon as his guts have got their fill,"
1012,BOOK I.,"I'll tell him all, by Jove I will!"
1013,BOOK I.,"Till he has granted my petition,"
1014,BOOK I.,Don't stir to keep 'em from perdition;
1015,BOOK I.,"Not e'en to save their souls, plague rot 'em!"
1016,BOOK I.,"So souse she plung'd, and reach'd the bottom."
1017,BOOK I.,
1018,BOOK I.,"Mean time Ulysses, full of cares,"
1019,BOOK I.,Had moor'd his boat at Chrysa's stairs:
1020,BOOK I.,"When sails were furl'd, and all made snug,"
1021,BOOK I.,"They tipp'd the can, and pass'd the jug;"
1022,BOOK I.,"Then fell to work, and brought their store"
1023,BOOK I.,Of cows and rotten sheep ashore:
1024,BOOK I.,"This done, the last of all came out"
1025,BOOK I.,The girl that caus'd this woful rout.
1026,BOOK I.,"Ulysses, ever on the lurch,"
1027,BOOK I.,"Hurries the girl away to church,"
1028,BOOK I.,Knowing full well that there he had
1029,BOOK I.,Best chance of finding her old dad;
1030,BOOK I.,"And as he gave her to th' old man,"
1031,BOOK I.,To lie[1] and cant he thus began:
1032,BOOK I.,
1033,BOOK I.,"I come upon my bended knees,"
1034,BOOK I.,Thine and Apollo's wrath t' appease;
1035,BOOK I.,"And that I'm in good earnest, see"
1036,BOOK I.,"Thy girl come back, and ransom-free;"
1037,BOOK I.,"And, what I own is boldly said,"
1038,BOOK I.,I've brought her with her maidenhead;
1039,BOOK I.,"For which, I hope, our friend you'll stand,"
1040,BOOK I.,"That Sol may hold his heavy hand,"
1041,BOOK I.,"The parson hugg'd and kiss'd his daughter,"
1042,BOOK I.,And shak'd the hands of them that brought her
1043,BOOK I.,"So pleas'd to see the girl again,"
1044,BOOK I.,He fell to prayers might and main;
1045,BOOK I.,"And, whilst the Greeks the cattle slay,"
1046,BOOK I.,The parson thus was heard to pray:
1047,BOOK I.,
1048,BOOK I.,"Apollo, pr'ythee hear me now,"
1049,BOOK I.,As eke thou didst nine days ago:
1050,BOOK I.,As thou at my request didst murder
1051,BOOK I.,"The Grecians, pr'ythee go no further;"
1052,BOOK I.,"Hear, once again, thy priest's petition,"
1053,BOOK I.,And mend their most bedaub'd condition.
1054,BOOK I.,
1055,BOOK I.,"Apollo, as the sound drew near,"
1056,BOOK I.,To ev'ry syllab lent an ear:
1057,BOOK I.,And now they fell to cutting throats
1058,BOOK I.,"Of bulls and oxen, sheep and goats."
1059,BOOK I.,"After the day-light god was serv'd,"
1060,BOOK I.,The priest for all the people carv'd.
1061,BOOK I.,But how the hungry whoresons scaff'd;
1062,BOOK I.,"How eagerly the beer they quaff'd,"
1063,BOOK I.,"Till they had left no single chink,"
1064,BOOK I.,"Either to hold more meat or drink,"
1065,BOOK I.,"None can describe: they grew so mellow,"
1066,BOOK I.,Nothing was heard but whoop and halloo;
1067,BOOK I.,"Rare songs they sung, and catches too--"
1068,BOOK I.,(The composition good and true)
1069,BOOK I.,"Apollo made 'em, but took care"
1070,BOOK I.,"They should not last above a year,"
1071,BOOK I.,Well knowing that the future race
1072,BOOK I.,"Of men all knowledge would disgrace,"
1073,BOOK I.,"And that his lines must have great luck,"
1074,BOOK I.,Not to give place to Stephen Duck.
1075,BOOK I.,
1076,BOOK I.,At sun-set all hands went from shore
1077,BOOK I.,On board their oyster-boat to snore.
1078,BOOK I.,"I' th' morning, when they hoist their sail,"
1079,BOOK I.,"Apollo lent a mack'rel gale,"
1080,BOOK I.,"With which they nimbly cross'd the main,"
1081,BOOK I.,And haul'd their boat ashore again.
1082,BOOK I.,
1083,BOOK I.,But now 'tis time we look about
1084,BOOK I.,And find the bold Achilles out:
1085,BOOK I.,"Pensive he sat, and bit his thumbs;"
1086,BOOK I.,"No comfort yet, no mammy comes:"
1087,BOOK I.,"The days had number'd just eleven,"
1088,BOOK I.,When Jupiter return'd to heaven;
1089,BOOK I.,He'd got his belly full of smacks
1090,BOOK I.,From thick-lip'd Ethiopian blacks.
1091,BOOK I.,
1092,BOOK I.,The mother on her word must think;
1093,BOOK I.,"So up she mounted in a twink,"
1094,BOOK I.,"Approach'd his godship, whom she took"
1095,BOOK I.,"Fast by the hand, and thus she spoke:"
1096,BOOK I.,
1097,BOOK I.,If ever I had luck to be
1098,BOOK I.,"Useful in time of need to thee,"
1099,BOOK I.,"(Which, I am sure, you can't deny,"
1100,BOOK I.,Unless you tell a cursed lie)
1101,BOOK I.,Quickly revenge th' affront that's done
1102,BOOK I.,By Agamemnon to my son.
1103,BOOK I.,"Let Hector thrash 'em, if he list,"
1104,BOOK I.,"Till ev'ry Grecian rogue's bepiss'd,"
1105,BOOK I.,And make them run like frighten'd rats
1106,BOOK I.,From mother Dobson's tabby cats.
1107,BOOK I.,
1108,BOOK I.,"Whilst Jove considers what to say,"
1109,BOOK I.,Onward she goes; she'll have no nay:
1110,BOOK I.,
1111,BOOK I.,"You must with my request comply,"
1112,BOOK I.,"My dearest dad, so don't deny;"
1113,BOOK I.,But let the heavenly rabble see
1114,BOOK I.,Some kindness is reserv'd for me.
1115,BOOK I.,
1116,BOOK I.,Then answers he who rolls the thunder:
1117,BOOK I.,"I'm much amaz'd, and greatly wonder,"
1118,BOOK I.,"That you should thus attempt, with tears,"
1119,BOOK I.,To set my rib and me by th' ears;
1120,BOOK I.,"This, by my soul! will make rare work:"
1121,BOOK I.,Juno will rate me like a Turk:
1122,BOOK I.,"You surely know, and have known long,"
1123,BOOK I.,The devil cannot match her tongue:
1124,BOOK I.,"To Troy, I'm sure, I wish full well,"
1125,BOOK I.,She ne'er forgets that tale to tell:
1126,BOOK I.,"But his away from hence, lest she"
1127,BOOK I.,Should spy you holding chat with me.
1128,BOOK I.,"If I but say I'll grant your suit,"
1129,BOOK I.,You may depend upon't I'll do't:
1130,BOOK I.,"With head (observe) I'll make a nod,"
1131,BOOK I.,That cannot be revers'd by god.
1132,BOOK I.,"The thund'rer then his noddle shakes,"
1133,BOOK I.,"And Greece, like city custard, quakes."
1134,BOOK I.,"Thetis, well pleas'd the Greeks to souse,"
1135,BOOK I.,Dives under water like a goose;
1136,BOOK I.,"Whilst Jove to th' upper house repairs,"
1137,BOOK I.,And calls about him all his peers;
1138,BOOK I.,Who ran t' attend his call much faster
1139,BOOK I.,Than schoolboys run to meet their master.
1140,BOOK I.,"All silent stood the gaping bevy,"
1141,BOOK I.,"Like sneaking courtiers at a levee,"
1142,BOOK I.,"Juno excepted: fear she scorns,"
1143,BOOK I.,"She hates all manners, damns all forms;"
1144,BOOK I.,And because Jove had just been talking
1145,BOOK I.,"With Thetis (nothing more provoking),"
1146,BOOK I.,"Her passion rose, and she ding dong"
1147,BOOK I.,"Would quarrel with him, right or wrong."
1148,BOOK I.,
1149,BOOK I.,"'Tis mighty civil, on my life,"
1150,BOOK I.,To keep all secrets from your wife:
1151,BOOK I.,"Is this the method, Mr. Jove,"
1152,BOOK I.,You take to show your wife your love?
1153,BOOK I.,"Pray who's that brimstone-looking quean,"
1154,BOOK I.,With whom you whispering was seen?
1155,BOOK I.,"Perhaps you're set some secret task,"
1156,BOOK I.,And I'm impertinent to ask.
1157,BOOK I.,"Is there a wife 'tween here and Styx,"
1158,BOOK I.,"Like me, would bear your whoring tricks?"
1159,BOOK I.,"But, goodman Roister! I'd have you know,"
1160,BOOK I.,"Though you are Jove, I still am Juno!"
1161,BOOK I.,
1162,BOOK I.,"Madam, says Jove, by all this prate,"
1163,BOOK I.,I partly guess what you'd be at;
1164,BOOK I.,"You want the secrets to disclose,"
1165,BOOK I.,Which I conceal from friends and foes;
1166,BOOK I.,You only seek your own disquiet;
1167,BOOK I.,Secrets to women are bad diet.
1168,BOOK I.,"A secret makes a desp'rate rumble,"
1169,BOOK I.,Nor ceases in the gut to grumble
1170,BOOK I.,"Till vent it finds; then out it flies,"
1171,BOOK I.,Attended with ten thousand lies;
1172,BOOK I.,"All characters to pieces tears,"
1173,BOOK I.,And sets the neighbourhood by th' ears.
1174,BOOK I.,"What's proper I'll to you relate,"
1175,BOOK I.,The rest remains with me and Fate:
1176,BOOK I.,"But from this day I'll order, no man"
1177,BOOK I.,That's wise shall trust a tattling woman.
1178,BOOK I.,
1179,BOOK I.,The goddess with the goggle eyes
1180,BOOK I.,"Roll'd 'em about, and thus replies:"
1181,BOOK I.,
1182,BOOK I.,"I find 'twill be in vain to plead,"
1183,BOOK I.,When once you get it in your head
1184,BOOK I.,To contradict your loving wife;
1185,BOOK I.,"You value neither noise nor strife,"
1186,BOOK I.,"But, spite of all that we can say,"
1187,BOOK I.,You mules will always have your way.
1188,BOOK I.,"But yet for Greece I'm sore afraid,"
1189,BOOK I.,"E'er since that cunning white-legg'd jade,"
1190,BOOK I.,"That Thetis, a long conf'rence had;"
1191,BOOK I.,"I'm sure she's hatching something bad,"
1192,BOOK I.,And hath some mighty favour won
1193,BOOK I.,For her dear ranting roaring son?
1194,BOOK I.,"Else, by my soul, you'd not have given"
1195,BOOK I.,A nod that shook both earth and heaven;
1196,BOOK I.,"Perhaps you'll take the whore's-bird's side,"
1197,BOOK I.,And thrash my Grecians back and hide.
1198,BOOK I.,
1199,BOOK I.,"Flux me! quoth Jove, thy jealous pate,"
1200,BOOK I.,"Instead of love, will move my hate."
1201,BOOK I.,"I tell thee, cunning thou must be"
1202,BOOK I.,To worm this secret out of me;
1203,BOOK I.,"'Tis better far, good wife, to cease"
1204,BOOK I.,"To plague me thus, and study peace;"
1205,BOOK I.,"Or if you want to make resistance,"
1206,BOOK I.,Call all the gods to your assistance;
1207,BOOK I.,"So all your jackets will I baste,"
1208,BOOK I.,You'll not rebel again in haste.
1209,BOOK I.,
1210,BOOK I.,"Juno, with face as broad as platter,"
1211,BOOK I.,Soon found she had mista'en the master;
1212,BOOK I.,"She relish'd not this surly dish,"
1213,BOOK I.,So sat her down as mute as fish:
1214,BOOK I.,"At which the guests were so confounded,"
1215,BOOK I.,That all their mirth was well nigh drowned
1216,BOOK I.,Their knives and forks they every one
1217,BOOK I.,Before their greasy plates laid down;
1218,BOOK I.,"Each mouth was ready cock'd, to beg"
1219,BOOK I.,"Leave to depart, and make a leg;"
1220,BOOK I.,"When Juno's son, ycleped Vulcan,"
1221,BOOK I.,"A special fellow at a full can,"
1222,BOOK I.,"Who was of handicrafts the top,"
1223,BOOK I.,"And kept a noted blacksmith's shop,"
1224,BOOK I.,"Where he made nets, steel caps, and thunder,"
1225,BOOK I.,And finish'd potlids to a wonder;
1226,BOOK I.,"He, finding things were going wrong,"
1227,BOOK I.,"And that they'd fall by th' ears ere long,"
1228,BOOK I.,"Starts up, and in a merry strain"
1229,BOOK I.,Hammer'd a speech from his own brain.
1230,BOOK I.,
1231,BOOK I.,"Quoth he, What pity 'tis that we,"
1232,BOOK I.,"Who should know nought but jollity,"
1233,BOOK I.,"Should scold and squabble, brawl and wrangle,"
1234,BOOK I.,And about mortal scoundrels jangle!
1235,BOOK I.,"In peace put we the can about,"
1236,BOOK I.,"Let Englishmen in drink fall out,"
1237,BOOK I.,"And, at the meetings of the trade,"
1238,BOOK I.,Fight when the reck'ning should be paid.
1239,BOOK I.,"Mother, you know not what you're doing;"
1240,BOOK I.,To CALLOT thus will be your ruin;
1241,BOOK I.,"He'll some time, in a dev'lish fury,"
1242,BOOK I.,"Do you some mischief, I'll assure you:"
1243,BOOK I.,"Yet, I'll lay sixpence to a farthing,"
1244,BOOK I.,"He'll kiss you, if you ask his pardon."
1245,BOOK I.,"This said, a swingeing bowl he takes,"
1246,BOOK I.,And drank it off for both their sakes;
1247,BOOK I.,"Then with a caper fill'd another,"
1248,BOOK I.,Which he presented to his mother:
1249,BOOK I.,
1250,BOOK I.,Not courtier-like I hand this bowl:
1251,BOOK I.,"But take it from an honest soul,"
1252,BOOK I.,That means and thinks whate'er he says;
1253,BOOK I.,It won't be so in future days:
1254,BOOK I.,"Here, drink Jove's health, and own his sway:"
1255,BOOK I.,You know all women must obey.
1256,BOOK I.,"When once my father's in a passion,"
1257,BOOK I.,"He's dev'lish cross, hear my relation:"
1258,BOOK I.,"In your good cause I felt his twist,"
1259,BOOK I.,My leg he seiz'd in his strong wrist;
1260,BOOK I.,"In vain it was with him to grapple,"
1261,BOOK I.,He grasp'd me as you would an apple;
1262,BOOK I.,"And from his mutton-fist when hurl'd,"
1263,BOOK I.,For three long days and nights I twirl'd;
1264,BOOK I.,"At last upon the earth fell squash,"
1265,BOOK I.,My legs were broken all to smash:
1266,BOOK I.,"'Tis true, they're set, as you may see,"
1267,BOOK I.,But most folks think damn'd awkwardly.
1268,BOOK I.,"He then the bowl, with clownish grace,"
1269,BOOK I.,"Fill'd round, and wip'd his sooty face,"
1270,BOOK I.,Then limp'd away into his place.
1271,BOOK I.,
1272,BOOK I.,"This cur'd them all from being dull,"
1273,BOOK I.,And made 'em laugh their bellies full:
1274,BOOK I.,"Once more their teeth to work they set,"
1275,BOOK I.,"And laid about 'em till they sweat,"
1276,BOOK I.,"Drinking, like well-fed aldermen,"
1277,BOOK I.,"A bumper every now and then,"
1278,BOOK I.,Which they took care their guts to put in
1279,BOOK I.,Whilst t' other slice of beef was cutting;
1280,BOOK I.,"For they, like cits, allow'd no crime"
1281,BOOK I.,"So great as that of losing time,"
1282,BOOK I.,"At home, abroad, or any meeting"
1283,BOOK I.,Where the debate must end in eating.
1284,BOOK I.,"Now they were in for't, all day long"
1285,BOOK I.,"They booz'd about, and had a song:"
1286,BOOK I.,The fiddlers scrap'd both flat and sharp;
1287,BOOK I.,Apollo thrum'd the old Welch harp:
1288,BOOK I.,Nine ballad-singers from the street
1289,BOOK I.,"Were fetch'd, with voices all so sweet,"
1290,BOOK I.,"Compar'd with them, Mansoli's squeaking"

1374,BOOK II.,Perplex'd with cares as well as fleas
1375,BOOK II.,"(For cares he in his bosom carried,"
1376,BOOK II.,"As every creature must that's married),"
1377,BOOK II.,"Was plotting, since he had begun,"

1379,BOOK II.,"And scratch'd, and scratch'd, but yet he could"

1381,BOOK II.,"To keep his word. At last he caught,"
1382,BOOK II.,"By scratching hard, a lucky thought"
1383,BOOK II.,"(And 'faith, I think, 'twas no bad scheme);"
1384,BOOK II.,"To send the Grecian chief a Dream,"

1386,BOOK II.,"A coat and waistcoat, ready cut"
1387,BOOK II.,"Out of the self-same kind of stuff,"
1388,BOOK II.,But yet it suited well enough
1389,BOOK II.,"To give it shape: Now, Mr. Dream,"
1390,BOOK II.,"Take care you keep the shape you seem,"
1391,BOOK II.,Says Jove; then do directly go
1392,BOOK II.,To Agamemnon's tent below:
1393,BOOK II.,Tell him to arm his ragged knaves
1394,BOOK II.,"With cudgels, spits, and quarter-staves,"
1395,BOOK II.,Then instantly their time employ
1396,BOOK II.,To rattle down the walls of Troy.

1405,BOOK II.,"As old as he, as wise his look,"
1406,BOOK II.,"Rubs the cull's noddle with his wings,"

1409,BOOK II.,"Monarch, how canst thou sleeping lie,"
1410,BOOK II.,When thou hast other fish to fry?

1418,BOOK II.,"Rise, and for once postpone thy nap,"
1419,BOOK II.,"Lest by some rogue it should be said,"

1425,BOOK II.,He bids thee arm thy ragged knaves

1436,BOOK II.,"Up starts the king, and with his nail"
1437,BOOK II.,"Scratch'd both his head, and back, and tail;"
1438,BOOK II.,"And all the while his fancy's tickl'd,"
1439,BOOK II.,To think how Troy would soon be pickl'd.
1440,BOOK II.,A silly goose! he little knew
1441,BOOK II.,What surly Jove resolv'd to do;
1442,BOOK II.,What shoals of sturdy knaves must tumble
1443,BOOK II.,Before they could the Trojans humble.
1444,BOOK II.,Down on an ancient chopping-block
1445,BOOK II.,This mighty warrior clapp'd his dock
1446,BOOK II.,"(The block, worn out with chopping meat,"
1447,BOOK II.,Now made the chief a rare strong seat):
1448,BOOK II.,"Then don'd his shirt with Holland cuff,"
1449,BOOK II.,"For, Frenchman-like, he lay in buff;"
1450,BOOK II.,Next o'er his greasy doublet threw
1451,BOOK II.,"A thread-bare coat that once was blue,"
1452,BOOK II.,But dirt and time had chang'd its hue;
1453,BOOK II.,"Slipp'd on his shoes, but lately cobbled,"
1454,BOOK II.,And to the board of council hobbled;
1455,BOOK II.,"But took his sword with brazen hilt,"
1456,BOOK II.,And wooden sceptre finely gilt.
1457,BOOK II.,"Now, Madam Morn popp'd up her face,"
1458,BOOK II.,And told 'em day came on apace;
1459,BOOK II.,When Agamemnon's beadles rouse
1460,BOOK II.,The Greeks to hear this joyful news.
1461,BOOK II.,"He long'd, like breeding wife, it seems,"
1462,BOOK II.,"To tell his tickling, pleasing dreams."
1463,BOOK II.,"I' th' int'rim, trotting to the fleet,"
1464,BOOK II.,"Old Nestor there he chanc'd to meet,"
1465,BOOK II.,"Whose tent he borrows for that morn,"
1466,BOOK II.,To make a council-chamber on;
1467,BOOK II.,"And reason good he had, I ween,"
1468,BOOK II.,It kept his own apartment clean.
1469,BOOK II.,
1470,BOOK II.,"Now all-hands met, he takes his time,"
1471,BOOK II.,And told his case in prose or rhyme:
1472,BOOK II.,
1473,BOOK II.,"Friends, neighbours, and confed'rates bold,"
1474,BOOK II.,"Attend, whilst I my tale unfold:"
1475,BOOK II.,"As in my bed I lay last night,"
1476,BOOK II.,I saw an odd-look'd kind of sprite;
1477,BOOK II.,"It seem'd, grave Nestor, to my view,"
1478,BOOK II.,Just such a queer old put as you--
1479,BOOK II.,"'Tis fact, for all your surly look--"
1480,BOOK II.,And this short speech distinctly spoke:
1481,BOOK II.,
1482,BOOK II.,"How canst thou, monarch, sleeping lie,"
1483,BOOK II.,When thou hast other fish to fry?
1484,BOOK II.,"O Atreus' son, thou mighty warrior,"
1485,BOOK II.,Whose father was a special farrier
1486,BOOK II.,"(Which, by the by, although 'tis true,"
1487,BOOK II.,Yet I'd be glad you'd tell me how
1488,BOOK II.,"This bushy-bearded spirit knew),"
1489,BOOK II.,"Hast thou no thought about decorum,"
1490,BOOK II.,Who art the very head o' th' quorum?
1491,BOOK II.,I shame myself to think I'm catching
1492,BOOK II.,"Thee fast asleep, instead of watching."
1493,BOOK II.,Is not all Greece pinn'd on thy lap?
1494,BOOK II.,"Rise, and for once postpone thy nap;"
1495,BOOK II.,"Or by some rogue it will be said,"
1496,BOOK II.,The chief of chiefs went drunk to bed:
1497,BOOK II.,"For Jove, by whom you are respected,"
1498,BOOK II.,Says your affairs sha'n't be neglected:
1499,BOOK II.,"But now on your affair he's poring,"
1500,BOOK II.,Whilst you lie f--ting here and snoring:
1501,BOOK II.,He bids thee arm thy ragged knaves
1502,BOOK II.,"With cudgels, spits, and quarter-staves;"
1503,BOOK II.,"For now the time is come, he swears,"
1504,BOOK II.,To pull Troy's walls about their ears:
1505,BOOK II.,"Nay more, he adds, the gods agree"
1506,BOOK II.,With Fate itself it thus shall be.
1507,BOOK II.,Jove and his queen have had their quantum
1508,BOOK II.,"Of jaw, and such-like rantum-scantum:"
1509,BOOK II.,"She now puts on her best behaviours,"
1510,BOOK II.,And they're as kind as incle-weavers.
1511,BOOK II.,"Then nothing more the Vision said,"
1512,BOOK II.,But kick'd me half way out of bed.
1513,BOOK II.,"This very token did, I vow,"
1514,BOOK II.,Convince me that the dream was true;
1515,BOOK II.,"For, waking soon, I found my head"
1516,BOOK II.,"And shoulders on the floor were laid,"
1517,BOOK II.,Whilst my long legs kept snug in bed:
1518,BOOK II.,"Therefore, since Jove, with good intent,"
1519,BOOK II.,"So rare a messenger has sent,"
1520,BOOK II.,"We should directly, I've a notion,"
1521,BOOK II.,Put all our jolly boys in motion:
1522,BOOK II.,"But first, what think you if we settle"
1523,BOOK II.,"A scheme to try the scarecrows' mettle,"
1524,BOOK II.,As with nine years they're worn to th' stumps?
1525,BOOK II.,I'll feign my kingship in the dumps
1526,BOOK II.,"With Jove himself, and then propose"
1527,BOOK II.,That homeward they direct their nose.
1528,BOOK II.,"But take you care, if I succeed,"
1529,BOOK II.,To show yourselves in time of need:
1530,BOOK II.,"Swear you don't mind the gen'ral's clack,"
1531,BOOK II.,But in a hurry drive 'em back.
1532,BOOK II.,
1533,BOOK II.,"He spoke, and squatting on his breech,"
1534,BOOK II.,Square-toes got up and made a speech:
1535,BOOK II.,"I think our chief would not beguile us,"
1536,BOOK II.,Says the old constable of Pylos.
1537,BOOK II.,"Had any soul though, but our leader,"
1538,BOOK II.,"For dreams and visions been a pleader,"
1539,BOOK II.,"I should, my boys, to say no worse,"
1540,BOOK II.,Have call'd him an old guzzling nurse.
1541,BOOK II.,"I seldom old wives' tales believe,"
1542,BOOK II.,Nurses invent 'em to deceive.
1543,BOOK II.,"But now there can be no disguise,"
1544,BOOK II.,For kings should scorn to tell folks lies;
1545,BOOK II.,"So let us e'en, with one accord,"
1546,BOOK II.,Resolve to take his royal word:
1547,BOOK II.,"For though the speech is queerish stuff,"
1548,BOOK II.,"'Tis the king's speech, and that's enough."
1549,BOOK II.,"I therefore say, My buffs so stout,"
1550,BOOK II.,Of this same vision make no doubt;
1551,BOOK II.,"The tokens are so very clear,"
1552,BOOK II.,There can be little room for fear.
1553,BOOK II.,"Did not our monarch, as he said,"
1554,BOOK II.,"Feel the Dream kick him out of bed,"
1555,BOOK II.,"And, by his waking posture, knew"
1556,BOOK II.,His sense of feeling told him true?
1557,BOOK II.,"Then, since affairs so far are gone,"
1558,BOOK II.,Let's put our fighting faces on.
1559,BOOK II.,"He said; nor did they longer stay,"
1560,BOOK II.,But from the council haste away.
1561,BOOK II.,The leaders bring their men along;
1562,BOOK II.,They still were many thousands strong;
1563,BOOK II.,"As thick as gardens swarm with bees,"
1564,BOOK II.,Or tailors' working-boards with fleas:
1565,BOOK II.,"And Jove, for fear they should not all"
1566,BOOK II.,"Attend, and mind their general's call,"
1567,BOOK II.,"Bid Fame, a chatt'ring, noisy strumpet,"
1568,BOOK II.,To sound her longest brazen trumpet:
1569,BOOK II.,
1570,BOOK II.,"[Illustration: Book II, page 82."
1571,BOOK II.,"He haw'd and hemm'd before he spoke,"
1572,BOOK II.,"Then raised his truncheon made of oak,"
1573,BOOK II.,"'Twas Vulcan's making, which Jove gave"
1574,BOOK II.,"To Mercury, A thieving knave.]"
1575,BOOK II.,
1576,BOOK II.,"This brought such numbers on the lawn,"
1577,BOOK II.,"The very earth was heard to groan,"
1578,BOOK II.,Nine criers went to still their noise;
1579,BOOK II.,That they might hear their leader's voice.
1580,BOOK II.,"He haw'd and hemm'd before he spoke,"
1581,BOOK II.,Then rais'd his truncheon made of oak:
1582,BOOK II.,"'Twas Vulcan's making, which Jove gave"
1583,BOOK II.,"To Mercury, a thieving knave;"
1584,BOOK II.,"Who going down to Kent to steal hops,"
1585,BOOK II.,Resign'd his staff to carter Pelops;
1586,BOOK II.,From Pelops it to Atreus came;
1587,BOOK II.,"He to Thyestes left the same,"
1588,BOOK II.,"Who kept it dry, lest rain should rot it,"
1589,BOOK II.,And when he dy'd Atrides got it:
1590,BOOK II.,"With this he rules the Greeks with ease,"
1591,BOOK II.,Or breaks their noddles if he please;
1592,BOOK II.,"Now leaning on't, he silence broke,"
1593,BOOK II.,"And with so grum an accent spoke,"
1594,BOOK II.,"Those people that the circle stood in,"
1595,BOOK II.,Fancy'd his mouth was full of pudding.
1596,BOOK II.,
1597,BOOK II.,"Thus he began: We've got, my neighbours,"
1598,BOOK II.,Finely rewarded for our labours:
1599,BOOK II.,"On Jove, you know, we have rely'd,"
1600,BOOK II.,"And several conjurers have try'd,"
1601,BOOK II.,"But both, I shame to say't, have ly'd."
1602,BOOK II.,"One says, that we on board our scullers"
1603,BOOK II.,Should all return with flying colours;
1604,BOOK II.,"Another, we should cram our breeches"
1605,BOOK II.,"As full as they can hold with riches,"
1606,BOOK II.,"For presents to our wives and misses,"
1607,BOOK II.,Which they'll repay us back with kisses.
1608,BOOK II.,"Instead of this, we're hack'd and worn,"
1609,BOOK II.,"Our money spent, and breeches torn;"
1610,BOOK II.,"And, to crown all, our empty sculls"
1611,BOOK II.,Fill'd with strange tales of cocks and bulls.
1612,BOOK II.,"Now Jove is got on t'other tack,"
1613,BOOK II.,And says we all must trundle back:
1614,BOOK II.,"Dry blows we've got, and, what is more,"
1615,BOOK II.,Our credit's lost upon this shore:
1616,BOOK II.,Nor can I find one soul that's willing
1617,BOOK II.,To trust us now a single shilling.
1618,BOOK II.,"No longer since than yesterday,"
1619,BOOK II.,"Our butcher broke, and ran away:"
1620,BOOK II.,"The baker swears too, by Apollo,"
1621,BOOK II.,If times don't mend he soon must follow:
1622,BOOK II.,"As for the alehouse-man, 'tis clear"
1623,BOOK II.,That half-penny a pot on beer
1624,BOOK II.,Will send him off before next year;
1625,BOOK II.,And then we all must be content
1626,BOOK II.,To guzzle down pure element.
1627,BOOK II.,"A time there was, when who but we!"
1628,BOOK II.,"Now were humbugg'd, you plainly see;"
1629,BOOK II.,"And, what's the worst of all, you'll say,"
1630,BOOK II.,A handful makes us run away:
1631,BOOK II.,"For, if our numbers I can ken,"
1632,BOOK II.,"Where Troy has one man, we have ten."
1633,BOOK II.,"Nine years, and more, the Grecian host"
1634,BOOK II.,Have been upon this cursed coast;
1635,BOOK II.,And Troy's as far from being sack'd
1636,BOOK II.,As when it was at first attack'd;
1637,BOOK II.,"The more we kill, the more appear;"
1638,BOOK II.,They grow as fast as mushrooms here!
1639,BOOK II.,"Like Toulon frigates rent and torn,"
1640,BOOK II.,Our leaky boats to stumps are worn;
1641,BOOK II.,Then let's be packing and away;
1642,BOOK II.,For what the vengeance should we stay?
1643,BOOK II.,Our wives without it won't remain;
1644,BOOK II.,Pray how the pox should they contain?
1645,BOOK II.,"For one that fasts, I'll lay there's ten"
1646,BOOK II.,Are now employing journeymen:
1647,BOOK II.,"If that's the case, I know you'll say"
1648,BOOK II.,'Tis time indeed to hyke away;
1649,BOOK II.,"Let us no more then make this fuss,"
1650,BOOK II.,Troy was not doom'd to fall by us.
1651,BOOK II.,
1652,BOOK II.,"Most of the rabble, that were not"
1653,BOOK II.,"Consulted in this famous plot,"
1654,BOOK II.,"Were hugely pleas'd, and straight begin"
1655,BOOK II.,"To cry, God save our noble king!"
1656,BOOK II.,"He that spoke last, spoke like a man."
1657,BOOK II.,"So whipp'd about, and off they ran."
1658,BOOK II.,"As they jogg'd on, their long lank hair"
1659,BOOK II.,Did like the dyers' rags appear;
1660,BOOK II.,Which you in every street will find
1661,BOOK II.,Waving like streamers in the wind:
1662,BOOK II.,"To it they went with all their heart,"
1663,BOOK II.,To get things ready to depart;
1664,BOOK II.,"And made a sort of humming roar,"
1665,BOOK II.,Like billows rumbling to the shore.
1666,BOOK II.,
1667,BOOK II.,"Halloo, cry'd some, here lend a hand"
1668,BOOK II.,To heave the lighters off the strand;
1669,BOOK II.,"Don't lounging stand to bite your nails,"
1670,BOOK II.,"But bustle, boys, and bend the sails."
1671,BOOK II.,"Now all the vessels launch'd had been,"
1672,BOOK II.,If scolding Juno had not seen:
1673,BOOK II.,"That noisy brimstone seldom slept,"
1674,BOOK II.,But a sharp eye for ever kept;
1675,BOOK II.,"Not out of love to th' Grecian state,"
1676,BOOK II.,"But to poor harmless Paris hate,"
1677,BOOK II.,Because on Ida's mountain he
1678,BOOK II.,Swore Venus better made than she:
1679,BOOK II.,"And most are of opinion still,"
1680,BOOK II.,He show'd himself a man of skill;
1681,BOOK II.,"For Juno, ever mischief hatching,"
1682,BOOK II.,"Had wrinkled all her bum with scratching,"
1683,BOOK II.,Whilst this enchanting Venus was
1684,BOOK II.,As smooth all o'er as polish'd glass.
1685,BOOK II.,
1686,BOOK II.,"Since then there was so wide a difference,"
1687,BOOK II.,Pray who can wonder at the preference?
1688,BOOK II.,For wrinkles I'm myself no pleader:
1689,BOOK II.,"Pray what are you, my gentle reader?"
1690,BOOK II.,A simple answer to the question
1691,BOOK II.,Will put an end to this digression:
1692,BOOK II.,"Why can't you speak now, when you're bid?"
1693,BOOK II.,You like smooth skins? I thought you did:
1694,BOOK II.,"And, since you've freely spoke your mind,"
1695,BOOK II.,"We'll back return, and Juno find."
1696,BOOK II.,"Upon a cloud she sat astride,"
1697,BOOK II.,(As now-a-days our angels ride)
1698,BOOK II.,"Where calling Pallas, thus she spoke:"
1699,BOOK II.,"Would it not any soul provoke,"
1700,BOOK II.,"To see those Grecian hang-dogs run,"
1701,BOOK II.,And leave their bus'ness all undone?
1702,BOOK II.,"This will be pretty work, indeed;"
1703,BOOK II.,"For Greece to fly, and Troy succeed."
1704,BOOK II.,Rot me! but Priam's whoring race
1705,BOOK II.,"(Sad dogs, without one grain of grace)"
1706,BOOK II.,"Shan't vamp it thus, whilst lovely Helen"
1707,BOOK II.,Is kept for that damn'd rogue to dwell in;
1708,BOOK II.,"That whoring whelp, who trims her so"
1709,BOOK II.,She never thinks of Menelau:
1710,BOOK II.,"But I shall stir my stumps, and make"
1711,BOOK II.,"The Greeks once more their broomsticks shake,"
1712,BOOK II.,"Then fly, my crony, in great haste,"
1713,BOOK II.,Lest opportunity be past.
1714,BOOK II.,"The cause, my girl, is partly thine;"
1715,BOOK II.,He scorn'd thy ware as well as mine:
1716,BOOK II.,"And, just as if he'd never seen us,"
1717,BOOK II.,"Bestow'd the prize on Madam Venus,"
1718,BOOK II.,"A blacksmith's wife, or kettle-mender,"
1719,BOOK II.,And one whose reputation's slender;
1720,BOOK II.,"Though her concerns I scorn to peep in,"
1721,BOOK II.,Yet Mars has had her long in keeping.
1722,BOOK II.,
1723,BOOK II.,"Pallas obeys, and down the slope"
1724,BOOK II.,"Slides, like a sailor on a rope."
1725,BOOK II.,Upon the barren shore she found
1726,BOOK II.,Ulysses lost in thoughts profound:
1727,BOOK II.,"His head with care so very full,"
1728,BOOK II.,He look'd as solemn as an owl;
1729,BOOK II.,"Was sorely grip'd, nor at this pinch"
1730,BOOK II.,Would launch his boats a single inch.
1731,BOOK II.,
1732,BOOK II.,"And is it thus, she says, my king,"
1733,BOOK II.,The Greeks their hogs to market bring?
1734,BOOK II.,"See how they skip on board each hoy,"
1735,BOOK II.,Ready to break their necks for joy!
1736,BOOK II.,"Shall Priam's lecherous son, that thrives"
1737,BOOK II.,"By kissing honest tradesmen's wives,"
1738,BOOK II.,"Be left that heaven of bliss to dwell in,"
1739,BOOK II.,The matchless arms of beauteous Helen?
1740,BOOK II.,"O, no; the very thought, by Gad,"
1741,BOOK II.,Makes Wisdom's goddess almost mad!
1742,BOOK II.,"Though, by thy help, I think 'tis hard."
1743,BOOK II.,But yet I singe the rascal's beard.
1744,BOOK II.,"Then fly, Ulysses, stop 'em all;"
1745,BOOK II.,The captains must their troops recall.
1746,BOOK II.,"Thou hast the gift o' th' gab, I know;"
1747,BOOK II.,"Be quick and use it, prithee do:"
1748,BOOK II.,"From Pallas thou shalt have assistance,"
1749,BOOK II.,Should any scoundrel make resistance.
1750,BOOK II.,
1751,BOOK II.,"Ulysses ken'd her voice so shrill,"
1752,BOOK II.,And mov'd to execute her will;
1753,BOOK II.,"Then pull'd his breeches up in haste,"
1754,BOOK II.,"Which being far too wide i' th' waist,"
1755,BOOK II.,Had left his buttocks almost bare--
1756,BOOK II.,He guess'd what made the goddess stare;
1757,BOOK II.,"Next try'd his coat of buff to doff,"
1758,BOOK II.,"But could not quickly get it off,"
1759,BOOK II.,"So fast upon his arms it stuck,"
1760,BOOK II.,Till Pallas kindly lent a pluck.
1761,BOOK II.,"Off then it came, when, like a man,"
1762,BOOK II.,He took him to his heels and ran.
1763,BOOK II.,The first that in his race he met
1764,BOOK II.,"Was Agamemnon in a pet,"
1765,BOOK II.,"Striving, for breakfast, with his truncheon"
1766,BOOK II.,To bruise a mouldy brown-bread luncheon.
1767,BOOK II.,
1768,BOOK II.,"Ulysses tells him, with a laugh,"
1769,BOOK II.,"I've better bus'ness for that staff,"
1770,BOOK II.,And must request you'll lend it me
1771,BOOK II.,To keep up my authority.
1772,BOOK II.,"Which having got, he look'd as big"
1773,BOOK II.,As J-n-n's coronation wig;
1774,BOOK II.,"Then flew, like wild-fire, through the ranks?"
1775,BOOK II.,'Twas wond'rous how he ply'd his shanks.
1776,BOOK II.,Each captain by his name he calls;
1777,BOOK II.,"I'm here, each noble captain bawls."
1778,BOOK II.,"Then thus: O knights of courage stout,"
1779,BOOK II.,"Pray, what the devil makes this rout?"
1780,BOOK II.,"You that exalted are for samples,"
1781,BOOK II.,Should set your soldiers good examples:
1782,BOOK II.,"Instead of that, I pray, why strove ye"
1783,BOOK II.,To run as if the devil drove ye?
1784,BOOK II.,"You knew full well, or I belie ye,"
1785,BOOK II.,Our general only spoke to try ye:
1786,BOOK II.,"All that he meant by't was to know,"
1787,BOOK II.,Whether we'd rather stay or go?
1788,BOOK II.,And is more vext to find us willing
1789,BOOK II.,"To run, than if he'd lost a shilling;"
1790,BOOK II.,"Because at council-board, this day,"
1791,BOOK II.,Quite different things you heard him say.
1792,BOOK II.,"But if he met a common man,"
1793,BOOK II.,That dar'd to contradict his plan;
1794,BOOK II.,"Or, if the scoundrel durst but grumble;"
1795,BOOK II.,"Nay, if he did but seem to mumble;"
1796,BOOK II.,"He, with his truncheon of command,"
1797,BOOK II.,"First knock'd him down, then bid him stand"
1798,BOOK II.,By this good management they stopp'd;
1799,BOOK II.,But not till eight or ten were dropp'd.
1800,BOOK II.,"From launching boats, with one accord,"
1801,BOOK II.,They trudg'd away to th' council-board.
1802,BOOK II.,The hubbub then began to cease:
1803,BOOK II.,"The noise was hush'd, and all was peace."
1804,BOOK II.,"Only one noisy ill-tongu'd whelp,"
1805,BOOK II.,"Thersites call'd, was heard to yelp:"
1806,BOOK II.,The rogue had neither shame nor manners;
1807,BOOK II.,His hide was only fit for tanners:
1808,BOOK II.,With downright malice to defame
1809,BOOK II.,"Good honest cocks, was all his aim:"
1810,BOOK II.,"All sorts of folks hard names he'd call,"
1811,BOOK II.,But aldermen the worst of all.
1812,BOOK II.,"Grotesque his figure was and vile,"
1813,BOOK II.,Much in the Hudibrastic style:
1814,BOOK II.,"One shoulder 'gainst his head did rest,"
1815,BOOK II.,The other dropp'd below his breast;
1816,BOOK II.,"His lank lean limbs in growth were stinted,"
1817,BOOK II.,And nine times worse than Wilkes he squinted:
1818,BOOK II.,"His pate was neither round nor flat,"
1819,BOOK II.,But shap'd like Mother Shipton's hat.
1820,BOOK II.,"You'd think, when this baboon was speaking,"
1821,BOOK II.,You heard some damn'd blind fiddler squeaking.
1822,BOOK II.,Now this sad dog by dirty joking
1823,BOOK II.,Was every day the chief provoking:
1824,BOOK II.,"The Greeks despis'd the rogue, and yet"
1825,BOOK II.,To hear his vile harangues they'd sit
1826,BOOK II.,Silent as though he'd been a Pitt.
1827,BOOK II.,His screech-owl's voice he rais'd with might
1828,BOOK II.,And vented thus his froth and spite:
1829,BOOK II.,
1830,BOOK II.,"Thersites from the matter wide is,"
1831,BOOK II.,Or something vexes great Atrides;
1832,BOOK II.,"But what the murrain it can be,"
1833,BOOK II.,The Lord above can only see!
1834,BOOK II.,"No man alive can be censorious,"
1835,BOOK II.,His reign has been so very glorious:
1836,BOOK II.,Then what has lodg'd the heavy bullet
1837,BOOK II.,"Of discontent within his gullet,"
1838,BOOK II.,"That makes him look as foul as thunder,"
1839,BOOK II.,To me's a secret and a wonder:
1840,BOOK II.,"He had the best, the Grecians know,"
1841,BOOK II.,"Of gold, and handsome wenches too."
1842,BOOK II.,"Best did I say? Bar Helen's bum,"
1843,BOOK II.,"He had the best in Christendom,"
1844,BOOK II.,And yet's not pleas'd: but tell us what
1845,BOOK II.,Thy mighty kingship would be at?
1846,BOOK II.,"Say but, shall Greece and I go speed"
1847,BOOK II.,"To Troy, and bring thee in thy need"
1848,BOOK II.,"The race of royal sons of whores,"
1849,BOOK II.,By ransom to increase thy stores?
1850,BOOK II.,"When we return, prepare to seize"
1851,BOOK II.,Whate'er the royal eye shall please:
1852,BOOK II.,This thou mayst do sans dread and fear;
1853,BOOK II.,'Tis mighty safe to plunder here.
1854,BOOK II.,"When the fit moves thee for that same,"
1855,BOOK II.,Take any captain's favourite dame;
1856,BOOK II.,"Our master wills, and 'tis but fit"
1857,BOOK II.,Such scrubs as we should all submit.
1858,BOOK II.,"Ye women Greeks, a sneaking race,"
1859,BOOK II.,Take my advice to quit this place;
1860,BOOK II.,And leave this mighty man of pleasure
1861,BOOK II.,To kiss his doxies at his leisure.
1862,BOOK II.,"When Hector comes, we'll then be mist"
1863,BOOK II.,"When Hector comes, he'll be bepist."
1864,BOOK II.,"The man that makes us slaves submit,"
1865,BOOK II.,"When Hector comes, will be be--t;"
1866,BOOK II.,He'll rue the dire unlucky day
1867,BOOK II.,He forc'd Achilles' girl away:
1868,BOOK II.,That buxom wench we all agreed
1869,BOOK II.,To give the bully for his need.
1870,BOOK II.,"Achilles, though in discontent,"
1871,BOOK II.,Don't think it proper to resent:
1872,BOOK II.,"But if the bully's patience ceases,"
1873,BOOK II.,He'll kick thee into half-crown pieces.
1874,BOOK II.,
1875,BOOK II.,Sudden Ulysses with a bound
1876,BOOK II.,"Rais'd his backside from off the ground,"
1877,BOOK II.,Ready to burst his very gall
1878,BOOK II.,To hear this scurvy rogue so maul
1879,BOOK II.,"The constable of Greece--an elf,"
1880,BOOK II.,Famous for hard-mouth'd words himself;
1881,BOOK II.,"His eyes look'd fierce, like ferrets red;"
1882,BOOK II.,Hunchback he scans; and thus he said:
1883,BOOK II.,
1884,BOOK II.,"Moon-calf, give o'er this noisy babbling,"
1885,BOOK II.,And don't stand prating thus and squabbling.
1886,BOOK II.,If thy foul tongue again dispute
1887,BOOK II.,"The royal sway, I'll cut it out;"
1888,BOOK II.,"Thou art, and hast been from thy birth,"
1889,BOOK II.,As great a rogue as lives on earth.
1890,BOOK II.,"What plea canst thou have names to call,"
1891,BOOK II.,Who art the vilest dog of all?
1892,BOOK II.,Think'st thou a single Greek will stir
1893,BOOK II.,An inch for such a snarling cur?
1894,BOOK II.,"How dar'st thou use Atrides' name,"
1895,BOOK II.,And of a constable make game?
1896,BOOK II.,For safe return great Jove we trust:
1897,BOOK II.,"'Tis ours to fight, and fight we must"
1898,BOOK II.,If to our noble chief a few
1899,BOOK II.,"Make presents, pray, what's that to you?"
1900,BOOK II.,"What mighty gifts have you bestow'd,"
1901,BOOK II.,Except your venom? scurvy toad!
1902,BOOK II.,"If the bold bucks their plunder gave,"
1903,BOOK II.,Thou canst not think' among the brave
1904,BOOK II.,We reckon such a lousy knave.
1905,BOOK II.,"May I be doom'd to keep a tin-shop,"
1906,BOOK II.,"Or smite my soul into a gin-shop,"
1907,BOOK II.,"There to be drawn by pint or gill,"
1908,BOOK II.,For drunken whores to take their fill;
1909,BOOK II.,Or may I find my dear son Telley
1910,BOOK II.,With back and bones all beat to jelly;
1911,BOOK II.,"Or in his stead behold another,"
1912,BOOK II.,Got by some rascal on his mother;
1913,BOOK II.,"If I don't punish the next fault,"
1914,BOOK II.,"By stripping off thy scarlet coat,"
1915,BOOK II.,"That shabby, ragged, thread-bare lac'd coat"
1916,BOOK II.,Then with a horsewhip dust thy waistcoat;
1917,BOOK II.,I'll lay on so that all the navy
1918,BOOK II.,Shall hear thy curship roar peccavi.
1919,BOOK II.,
1920,BOOK II.,"This said, his broomshaft with a thwack"
1921,BOOK II.,He drove against his huckle back.
1922,BOOK II.,"It fell with such a dev'lish thump,"
1923,BOOK II.,It almost rais'd another hump.
1924,BOOK II.,"The poor faint-hearted culprit cries,"
1925,BOOK II.,And tears ran down his blood-shot eyes:
1926,BOOK II.,"With clout he wip'd his ugly face,"
1927,BOOK II.,And sneak'd in silence to his place.
1928,BOOK II.,Then might you hear the mob declare
1929,BOOK II.,"Their thoughts on courage, and on fear."
1930,BOOK II.,"Up to the stars they cry'd Ulysses,"
1931,BOOK II.,A braver fellow never pisses;
1932,BOOK II.,"Of insolence he stops the tide,"
1933,BOOK II.,Nor gives it time to spread too wide.
1934,BOOK II.,"We want but half a score such samples,"
1935,BOOK II.,To make all prating knaves examples:
1936,BOOK II.,"'Twould teach the mob much better things,"
1937,BOOK II.,Than dare to chatter about kings.
1938,BOOK II.,"Whilst thus they sing Ulysses' praises,"
1939,BOOK II.,The constable his body raises.
1940,BOOK II.,The gen'ral's truncheon of command
1941,BOOK II.,He flourish'd in his dexter hand.
1942,BOOK II.,"Pallas in herald's coat stood by,"
1943,BOOK II.,"And with great noise did silence cry,"
1944,BOOK II.,That all the rabble far and near
1945,BOOK II.,This crafty Grecian's speech might hear.
1946,BOOK II.,With staring looks and open jaws
1947,BOOK II.,They catch each syllab as it flows.
1948,BOOK II.,"First, with his hand he scratch'd his head,"
1949,BOOK II.,To try if wit's alive or dead:
1950,BOOK II.,"But, when he found his wit was strong,"
1951,BOOK II.,"And ready to assist his tongue,"
1952,BOOK II.,"To clear his throat he hem'd aloud,"
1953,BOOK II.,And thus humbugg'd the list'ning crowd:
1954,BOOK II.,
1955,BOOK II.,"Unlucky chief, to be so us'd,"
1956,BOOK II.,"Deserted first, and then abus'd!"
1957,BOOK II.,"At Argos, when we came to muster,"
1958,BOOK II.,"And were all gather'd in a cluster,"
1959,BOOK II.,"The general voice was heard to say,"
1960,BOOK II.,The de'il fetch him that runs away!
1961,BOOK II.,"Then took a bible oath that night,"
1962,BOOK II.,They never would return from fight
1963,BOOK II.,Till the old Trojan town should tumble;
1964,BOOK II.,And yet you see for home they grumble.
1965,BOOK II.,"I own myself, 'tis very hard"
1966,BOOK II.,To be from home so long debarr'd:
1967,BOOK II.,If but a single fortnight we
1968,BOOK II.,Are kept confin'd upon the sea
1969,BOOK II.,"From our good wives and bantlings dear,"
1970,BOOK II.,"How do we rave, and curse, and swear!"
1971,BOOK II.,"Then, after nine years' absence, sure"
1972,BOOK II.,These folks may look a little sour.
1973,BOOK II.,They're not to blame for being sad;
1974,BOOK II.,"But thus bamboozled, makes one mad:"
1975,BOOK II.,"Though wizard Calchas plainly said,"
1976,BOOK II.,"If we the space of nine years staid,"
1977,BOOK II.,The tenth we surely should destroy
1978,BOOK II.,This paltry mud-wall'd borough Troy.
1979,BOOK II.,"Have patience then, and let's endure"
1980,BOOK II.,To box it out a few weeks more.
1981,BOOK II.,Remember how a mighty dragon
1982,BOOK II.,A plane-tree mounted from a waggon;
1983,BOOK II.,"He found a bird's nest at the top,"
1984,BOOK II.,And quickly ate eight young ones up;
1985,BOOK II.,To make the ninth there wants another;
1986,BOOK II.,On which the serpent snapp'd the mother:
1987,BOOK II.,"Though, after he had made this rout,"
1988,BOOK II.,He ne'er had time to shit 'em out;
1989,BOOK II.,For twenty minutes were not gone
1990,BOOK II.,"Before he chang'd to solid stone,"
1991,BOOK II.,"Where, on the summit of a hill,"
1992,BOOK II.,"At Aulis, you may see him still."
1993,BOOK II.,"When Calchas saw this wondrous thing,"
1994,BOOK II.,"Like Endor's witch, he drew a ring;"
1995,BOOK II.,"And, standing by himself i' th' middle,"
1996,BOOK II.,Began this wonder to unriddle:
1997,BOOK II.,
1998,BOOK II.,"My friends, if you'll but lend an ear,"
1999,BOOK II.,I'll quickly ease you of your fear:
2000,BOOK II.,"Give you but credit to my speeches,"
2001,BOOK II.,And then you'll all keep cleaner breeches.
2002,BOOK II.,"This prodigy from Jove was sent ye,"
2003,BOOK II.,To show that something good he meant ye:
2004,BOOK II.,"As many birds, so many years"
2005,BOOK II.,Should we be kept in hopes and fears;
2006,BOOK II.,"But 'ware the tenth, for then shall Ilion"
2007,BOOK II.,"Tumble, though guarded by a million."
2008,BOOK II.,"All this may happen, if you stay,"
2009,BOOK II.,"But cannot, if you run away:"
2010,BOOK II.,"For, be the captains e'er so cunning,"
2011,BOOK II.,No towns were ever ta'en by running.
2012,BOOK II.,"Can you remember Helen's rape,"
2013,BOOK II.,And let those Trojan whelps escape?
2014,BOOK II.,Let that eternal rascal go
2015,BOOK II.,That made poor Helen cry O! O?
2016,BOOK II.,
2017,BOOK II.,"Up started then old chitter chatter,"
2018,BOOK II.,And lent his hand to clench the matter:
2019,BOOK II.,"You are fine fellows, smite my eyes,"
2020,BOOK II.,If blust'ring words could get a prize:
2021,BOOK II.,"At first you all could say great things,"
2022,BOOK II.,And swear you'd pull down popes and kings;
2023,BOOK II.,"In a great splutter take, like Teague,"
2024,BOOK II.,The solemn covenant and league;
2025,BOOK II.,"For Ilion's walls resolve to steer,"
2026,BOOK II.,And store of bread and cheese prepare.
2027,BOOK II.,"Now all, I find, was but a joke;"
2028,BOOK II.,Your bouncing's vanish'd into smoke.
2029,BOOK II.,But precious time by talk is spent;
2030,BOOK II.,To pull down Troy is our intent;
2031,BOOK II.,"And we will do't without delay,"
2032,BOOK II.,"If you, Atrides, lead the way."
2033,BOOK II.,"Whoever here are not content,"
2034,BOOK II.,Pray let 'em all be homeward sent.
2035,BOOK II.,Their help we value not three farthings:
2036,BOOK II.,Cowards make excellent churchwardens;
2037,BOOK II.,"Then let them to their parish go,"
2038,BOOK II.,And serve their town in noise and show.
2039,BOOK II.,"No weapon should they touch but needles,"
2040,BOOK II.,Or staves for constables and beadles:
2041,BOOK II.,"Such posts as these will suit men right,"
2042,BOOK II.,That eat much keener than they fight;
2043,BOOK II.,"Therefore, whoever dare not stay,"
2044,BOOK II.,I'd have directly sneak away.
2045,BOOK II.,When we the Trojan hides shall curry
2046,BOOK II.,"Without their help, they'll be so sorry"
2047,BOOK II.,"That they will hang themselves, I hope--"
2048,BOOK II.,"And, by my soul, I'll find 'em rope."
2049,BOOK II.,Then how the rogues will wish they'd fought!
2050,BOOK II.,But wishes will avail 'em nought.
2051,BOOK II.,"Did not great Jove, when we set out,"
2052,BOOK II.,Make a most damn'd confounded rout?
2053,BOOK II.,"Did he not roll the ball, and roll"
2054,BOOK II.,Till he half crack'd his mustard bowl[1];
2055,BOOK II.,"And kept the noise upon our right,"
2056,BOOK II.,"To hearten us to go and fight,"
2057,BOOK II.,Till every wench that Troy did dwell in
2058,BOOK II.,Should cry O! O! as much as Helen?
2059,BOOK II.,Show me the man that dare but think
2060,BOOK II.,To make the poorest Grecian shrink;
2061,BOOK II.,"If any rascal draws one scrub in,"
2062,BOOK II.,I'll give the dog a handsome drubbing.
2063,BOOK II.,"And thou, my bully, be not nice,"
2064,BOOK II.,But take for once a fool's advice;
2065,BOOK II.,"Let's not like city rabble fight,"
2066,BOOK II.,"Who roar all day, and drink all night;"
2067,BOOK II.,Millions of such can ne'er oppose
2068,BOOK II.,A little band of men well chose;
2069,BOOK II.,
2070,BOOK II.,[1] They made thunder formerly in the play-houses by rolling a ball in
2071,BOOK II.,an empty mustard bowl.
2072,BOOK II.,
2073,BOOK II.,"For discipline, when manag'd right,"
2074,BOOK II.,Will make a trainband captain fight.
2075,BOOK II.,"Let me advise, that ev'ry shire"
2076,BOOK II.,To their own rendezvous retire;
2077,BOOK II.,"Nor let them mix, but each be sent"
2078,BOOK II.,To his own ragged regiment.
2079,BOOK II.,"Let their chief constable command,"
2080,BOOK II.,If you can find a chief will stand:
2081,BOOK II.,The leaders then will quickly ken
2082,BOOK II.,"Who fight like women, who like men;"
2083,BOOK II.,"Who fight as if inspir'd by Mars,"
2084,BOOK II.,"Or who, like Dutchmen, hang an arse;"
2085,BOOK II.,"Can punish every sneaking knave,"
2086,BOOK II.,And with good punch reward the brave:
2087,BOOK II.,"Then shall we understand, no doubt,"
2088,BOOK II.,Why Troy so long has held it out;
2089,BOOK II.,"And if they've done us all these evils,"
2090,BOOK II.,"By help of men, or gods, or devils."
2091,BOOK II.,
2092,BOOK II.,Atrides gave him this for answer:
2093,BOOK II.,"I now can plainly see, old grandsire,"
2094,BOOK II.,That noisy chatt'ring ribs of thine
2095,BOOK II.,Has got more brains by half than mine:
2096,BOOK II.,"If Jove, to help us in our streights,"
2097,BOOK II.,"Would lend us half a score such pates,"
2098,BOOK II.,"Split me, we should have brains enough"
2099,BOOK II.,"To strip these Trojans into buff,"
2100,BOOK II.,And all the men and women leave
2101,BOOK II.,As nak'd as Adam first knew Eve.
2102,BOOK II.,"But Jove, or by design or chance;"
2103,BOOK II.,Has led us all a pretty dance:
2104,BOOK II.,'Tis he that makes us thus dispute
2105,BOOK II.,And squabble till we all fall out.
2106,BOOK II.,"As for Achilles, I abus'd him,"
2107,BOOK II.,"Kidnap'd his girl, and vilely us'd him;"
2108,BOOK II.,"And, like two English tars, we swore"
2109,BOOK II.,And scolded for a little whore;
2110,BOOK II.,But hope (unless I am beguil'd)
2111,BOOK II.,Ere long we shall be reconcil'd;
2112,BOOK II.,"And then, my boys, you'll see how soon"
2113,BOOK II.,"This whore's nest, Troy, will tumble down."
2114,BOOK II.,But now 'tis time for every sinner
2115,BOOK II.,To look out sharp to find a dinner;
2116,BOOK II.,"And then we'll fight, while fighting's good,"
2117,BOOK II.,And drench our soleless shoes in blood.
2118,BOOK II.,"Fit then your potlids on your wrists,"
2119,BOOK II.,And grasp your broomsticks in your fists;
2120,BOOK II.,"Your mettled horses bring all out,"
2121,BOOK II.,"Both cut and longtail, for this bout."
2122,BOOK II.,"Like hungry wolves and bears we'll fight,"
2123,BOOK II.,And kick and cuff from morn to night:
2124,BOOK II.,Who dares his coward head to flinch
2125,BOOK II.,The thousandth part of half an inch
2126,BOOK II.,"Or should a moment's time let slip,"
2127,BOOK II.,"By skulking in his crazy ship,"
2128,BOOK II.,"His scurvy hide, for shunning blows,"
2129,BOOK II.,Shall be devour'd by carrion crows.
2130,BOOK II.,"Soon as he spoke, both front and rear"
2131,BOOK II.,Began to look confounded queer.
2132,BOOK II.,"But late they thought to kiss their wives,"
2133,BOOK II.,And lead at home good quiet lives;
2134,BOOK II.,"Instead of that, they find they must"
2135,BOOK II.,Have t'other bout at cut and thrust:
2136,BOOK II.,"So forc'd against their wills to stay,"
2137,BOOK II.,The grumbling whore's-birds sneak'd away.
2138,BOOK II.,"Now fires by scores were quickly made,"
2139,BOOK II.,And cows by dozens knock'd o' th' head.
2140,BOOK II.,"The victuals for theirselves they took,"
2141,BOOK II.,But wisely fed their gods with smoke:
2142,BOOK II.,"For men it would be choking stuff,"
2143,BOOK II.,But for the gods did well enough.
2144,BOOK II.,"And whilst the garbage broils, they pray"
2145,BOOK II.,T'escape a broken pate that day.
2146,BOOK II.,"But to fill all their bellies full,"
2147,BOOK II.,The priest had drest a fine young bull;
2148,BOOK II.,And then invited ev'ry chief
2149,BOOK II.,To come and eat this rare bull beef;
2150,BOOK II.,"Ask'd Nestor first, because his beard"
2151,BOOK II.,Was longest by a full half-yard;
2152,BOOK II.,"Idomen did the next succeed,"
2153,BOOK II.,And then that varlet Diomed:
2154,BOOK II.,"Ajax the less, and Ajax great,"
2155,BOOK II.,With sly Ulysses took their seat;
2156,BOOK II.,"Lest they should think the cuckold slighted,"
2157,BOOK II.,He came to dinner uninvited.
2158,BOOK II.,"Now each man draws his pudding-knife,"
2159,BOOK II.,And eats as though he ate for life.
2160,BOOK II.,"But first, Atrides said a grace,"
2161,BOOK II.,Holding his hat before his face;
2162,BOOK II.,"Then added, in a canting tone,"
2163,BOOK II.,A pray'r he'd better left alone.
2164,BOOK II.,
2165,BOOK II.,O mighty Jupiter! that shrouds
2166,BOOK II.,Thy dwelling-house with coal-black clouds
2167,BOOK II.,"Of thy own weaving, great protector,"
2168,BOOK II.,"Grant I may swinge this sad dog, Hector,"
2169,BOOK II.,"Without the help, if so thy will is,"
2170,BOOK II.,Of that same bullying scrub Achilles.
2171,BOOK II.,"But Jove, I verily believe,"
2172,BOOK II.,Just then was laughing in his sleeve;
2173,BOOK II.,Nor would he let the foolish elf
2174,BOOK II.,Kill one much better than himself:
2175,BOOK II.,But though he kick'd the canting pray'r
2176,BOOK II.,"A thousand fathom in the air,"
2177,BOOK II.,"Yet did he not refuse the treat,"
2178,BOOK II.,"But snuff'd the smoke, and lick'd the meat."
2179,BOOK II.,"And now, to show they scorn all thieving,"
2180,BOOK II.,"They serve Jove first, then take his leaving;"
2181,BOOK II.,"Upon his altar burnt a piece,"
2182,BOOK II.,And up his nose sent smoke and grease:
2183,BOOK II.,"The god they were resolv'd to please,"
2184,BOOK II.,Or smoke him till they made him sneeze:
2185,BOOK II.,For he would think them very hollow
2186,BOOK II.,To keep him sharper than Apollo;
2187,BOOK II.,"Therefore, Burn more and more, they cry'd,"
2188,BOOK II.,Until he owns he's satisfy'd.
2189,BOOK II.,"When all had stuff'd their bellies full,"
2190,BOOK II.,"And ate the very hoofs o' th' bull,"
2191,BOOK II.,"Old chatt'ring Nestor 'gan to talk,"
2192,BOOK II.,And thus to Agamemnon spoke:
2193,BOOK II.,
2194,BOOK II.,"Bid the blind fiddlers scrape away,"
2195,BOOK II.,And all the troops shall march to-day;
2196,BOOK II.,"And, that no useful man be mist,"
2197,BOOK II.,Let muster-master bring his list
2198,BOOK II.,"And call 'em o'er: if then we're right,"
2199,BOOK II.,"Do you lead on, by Jove we'll fight."
2200,BOOK II.,At the chief constable's commands
2201,BOOK II.,They muster'd all their trusty bands;
2202,BOOK II.,"Each knew his right and left hand man,"
2203,BOOK II.,And eke his officer could scan.
2204,BOOK II.,"As Nestor said, each hang-dog went"
2205,BOOK II.,To his own ragged regiment.
2206,BOOK II.,"Minerva too was got among 'em,"
2207,BOOK II.,Though she of right did not belong 'em;
2208,BOOK II.,"Her brawny arm a potlid shak'd,"
2209,BOOK II.,"As bright as blacking-balls could make't,"
2210,BOOK II.,"On which there hung an ugly head,"
2211,BOOK II.,"So grim, 'twould strike the train-bands dead:"
2212,BOOK II.,"With this, and other little helps,"
2213,BOOK II.,She cheers the poor faint-hearted whelps.
2214,BOOK II.,
2215,BOOK II.,"[Illustration: Book II, page 116."
2216,BOOK II.,"Her brawny arm a potlid shak'd,"
2217,BOOK II.,"As bright as blacking-balls could make't,"
2218,BOOK II.,"On which there hung an ugly head,"
2219,BOOK II.,"So grim, 'twould strike the train-bands dead:]"
2220,BOOK II.,
2221,BOOK II.,"For wives they now no longer sob,"
2222,BOOK II.,But swear to die or do the job.
2223,BOOK II.,"As when a bonfire, with a noise,"
2224,BOOK II.,"Is kindled by the parish-boys,"
2225,BOOK II.,"It catches first the straw, then rushes."
2226,BOOK II.,"And seizes on the dry furze-bushes,"
2227,BOOK II.,"Which causes such a dev'lish glaring,"
2228,BOOK II.,That half the fools i' th' town stand staring:
2229,BOOK II.,Just so you spy'd reflected streaks
2230,BOOK II.,From greasy doublets of the Greeks;
2231,BOOK II.,"For noise, you'd swear these sons of Greece"
2232,BOOK II.,"Were nought but flocks of Solan geese,"
2233,BOOK II.,"Who gabble rarely in their flight,"
2234,BOOK II.,But ten times louder when they 'light:
2235,BOOK II.,"Thus in a noisy crowd they wander,"
2236,BOOK II.,Before they reach the fam'd Scamander;
2237,BOOK II.,"And as they hasten to the shore,"
2238,BOOK II.,They make the very welkin roar.
2239,BOOK II.,"Thick as the crowds that walk the Strand,"
2240,BOOK II.,Upon the river's bank they stand;
2241,BOOK II.,"Or thick as leaves that yearly fall,"
2242,BOOK II.,By pecks and bushels in the Mall;
2243,BOOK II.,"Or swarms of flies, that find a crop"
2244,BOOK II.,Of sugar in a grocer's shop;
2245,BOOK II.,"So throng'd the varlets stand, and vow"
2246,BOOK II.,They'll beat the Trojans black and blue.
2247,BOOK II.,"About each trusty serjeant goes,"
2248,BOOK II.,"And sets them all in proper rows,"
2249,BOOK II.,As easily as Rachael Sparrow
2250,BOOK II.,"Places the apples in her barrow,"
2251,BOOK II.,Where (though at first no form they keep)
2252,BOOK II.,She quickly makes a curious heap.
2253,BOOK II.,"Above the rest the king appears,"
2254,BOOK II.,And tops 'em all by th' head and ears:
2255,BOOK II.,"He look'd, amidst this set of warriors,"
2256,BOOK II.,Like a great hound amongst the tarriers.
2257,BOOK II.,"For breadth of chest, as well as back,"
2258,BOOK II.,"He beat the mighty bruiser, Slack;"
2259,BOOK II.,But in his strut and martial air
2260,BOOK II.,He seem'd a first-rate grenadier.
2261,BOOK II.,This day Jove order'd he should pass
2262,BOOK II.,"To view, much bigger than he was:"
2263,BOOK II.,And as he knew the head o' th' cull
2264,BOOK II.,"With brains was not a quarter full,"
2265,BOOK II.,"He clapp'd a candle in his skull,"
2266,BOOK II.,"Which shining briskly through his eyes,"
2267,BOOK II.,Fill'd all the Grecians with surprise;
2268,BOOK II.,"For Jove, you need not fear, took care,"
2269,BOOK II.,"At proper times, to make folks stare."
2270,BOOK II.,As for these various ragged packs
2271,BOOK II.,"Of rogues, from different wapentakes,"
2272,BOOK II.,Their Christian names I've many times
2273,BOOK II.,Labour'd to jumble into rhymes;
2274,BOOK II.,"But could not do it for my soul,"
2275,BOOK II.,So leave them to the muster-roll.
2276,BOOK II.,If any critic choose to pop
2277,BOOK II.,"His head into my printer's shop,"
2278,BOOK II.,"He'll find a copy there, not spurious,"
2279,BOOK II.,Left for th' inspection of the curious.

2336,BOOK III.,Both sides for fisty-cuffs prepare.
2337,BOOK III.,"The Trojans toss their caps and shout,"
2338,BOOK III.,And noise proclaims 'em bloody stout;
2339,BOOK III.,Like cranes that fly in winter time
2340,BOOK III.,(As poets tell us) to a clime
2341,BOOK III.,"Where pigmies dwell, with whom they fight"
2342,BOOK III.,To th' ears in blood from morn to night.
2343,BOOK III.,But the bold Grecians on their toes
2344,BOOK III.,"Steal softly to surprise their foes,"
2345,BOOK III.,Taking huge steps along the green
2346,BOOK III.,"To get a blow before they're seen,"
2347,BOOK III.,"Knowing, a sorry rogue may crack"
2348,BOOK III.,A brave man's crown behind his back.
2349,BOOK III.,"With nimble feet, in sweat well soak'd,"
2350,BOOK III.,"They trudge it, though with dust half chok'd."
2351,BOOK III.,"Thus, when a mist on mountain head"
2352,BOOK III.,"As thick as mustard round is spread,"
2353,BOOK III.,The puzzled shepherd cannot keep
2354,BOOK III.,The goats from mingling with the sheep:
2355,BOOK III.,"So of the Greeks, not one, I trow,"
2356,BOOK III.,"Ask him but hastily, could know"
2357,BOOK III.,Whether his nose was on or no.
2358,BOOK III.,Now front to front they ready stand
2359,BOOK III.,"To fight, and only wait command;"
2360,BOOK III.,"When nimble Paris to the van,"
2361,BOOK III.,"Dress'd à la mode de François, ran:"
2362,BOOK III.,"With coney-skins he edg'd his coat,"
2363,BOOK III.,To show he was a man of note:
2364,BOOK III.,A cross-bow o'er his back was slung;
2365,BOOK III.,And on his thigh his poniard hung.
2366,BOOK III.,"A staff he pois'd would fell an ox,"
2367,BOOK III.,And dar'd the boldest Greek to box.
2368,BOOK III.,"As thus he struts, and makes a splutter,"
2369,BOOK III.,"Like crow i' th' middle of a gutter,"
2370,BOOK III.,"Him Menelaus soon espies,"
2371,BOOK III.,And joyful to himself he cries:
2372,BOOK III.,
2373,BOOK III.,"Blast my old shoes, but very soon"
2374,BOOK III.,I'll have a knock at your rogue's crown!
2375,BOOK III.,"Then darted, in a bloody rage,"
2376,BOOK III.,From his old duns cart to engage:
2377,BOOK III.,"And as he hied along to meet him,"
2378,BOOK III.,He look'd as if he meant to eat him.
2379,BOOK III.,"So joys the bailiff, when he spies"
2380,BOOK III.,A half-pay officer his prize:
2381,BOOK III.,"Headlong he drives across the way,"
2382,BOOK III.,"Regardless both of cart and dray,"
2383,BOOK III.,Nor stops till he has seiz'd his prey.
2384,BOOK III.,
2385,BOOK III.,"Soon as the youth the cuckold saw,"
2386,BOOK III.,"As guilt will ever feel an awe,"
2387,BOOK III.,"In spite of all that he could say,"
2388,BOOK III.,He found his legs would run away:
2389,BOOK III.,"Then, since the matter turn'd out so,"
2390,BOOK III.,"'Twas best, he thought, to let 'em go;"
2391,BOOK III.,"So turn'd about, and in a crack"
2392,BOOK III.,They brought their master safely back;
2393,BOOK III.,"And, as he puff'd along, we find him"
2394,BOOK III.,Not daring once to look behind him.
2395,BOOK III.,As when a bumpkin sees a snake
2396,BOOK III.,"Come slyly stealing from the brake,"
2397,BOOK III.,"He starts, and looks confounded cunning,"
2398,BOOK III.,But quickly saves himself by running:
2399,BOOK III.,"So this young beau the cuckold shuns,"
2400,BOOK III.,And 'mongst his trusty Trojans runs.
2401,BOOK III.,This the bold Hector could not bear;
2402,BOOK III.,He thought he ran away for fear--
2403,BOOK III.,"Without considering, now and then"
2404,BOOK III.,The very best and boldest men
2405,BOOK III.,Cannot their members so command
2406,BOOK III.,To make 'em at all seasons stand.
2407,BOOK III.,Be that as't may; with accent grave
2408,BOOK III.,He thus began to scold the knave:
2409,BOOK III.,
2410,BOOK III.,"Paris, says he, you're but a cheat,"
2411,BOOK III.,And only dare the wenches meet;
2412,BOOK III.,"But though a man you dare not face,"
2413,BOOK III.,"Yet, when the fight becomes a chase,"
2414,BOOK III.,You'd beat a thousand in the race.
2415,BOOK III.,"I wish, ere Nelly thou hadst felt,"
2416,BOOK III.,"Thou'dst broke thy neck, or hadst been gelt:"
2417,BOOK III.,"Better by half than thus to bully,"
2418,BOOK III.,Then run away from such a cully.
2419,BOOK III.,"The Greeks all swear thou art besh-t,"
2420,BOOK III.,And their fat sides with laughing split.
2421,BOOK III.,Thou look a soldier! thou be d----d!
2422,BOOK III.,The Grecians cannot be so flamm'd.
2423,BOOK III.,When thy fine long-boats went to Greece
2424,BOOK III.,To steal away this precious piece;
2425,BOOK III.,"Say, did'st thou, in thy first attack"
2426,BOOK III.,"On Helen's freehold, thus give back?"
2427,BOOK III.,"Joy to thy foes, shame to thy race,"
2428,BOOK III.,"Thy father's grief, and Troy's disgrace,"
2429,BOOK III.,"Recover thy lost credit soon,"
2430,BOOK III.,And stoutly stand by what you've done;
2431,BOOK III.,"Or else all Troy, as well as me,"
2432,BOOK III.,Thy buxom wench will plainly see
2433,BOOK III.,Belongs a better man than thee.
2434,BOOK III.,"Take heed, Troy may awake at last,"
2435,BOOK III.,And make thee pay for all that's past.
2436,BOOK III.,Here Paris blush'd--a sign of grace;
2437,BOOK III.,Nor durst he look in Hector's face:
2438,BOOK III.,
2439,BOOK III.,"Then answers, By my soul, you're right"
2440,BOOK III.,But who like you can preach and fight?
2441,BOOK III.,"I know you're made of best of steel,"
2442,BOOK III.,And box as if you could not feel.
2443,BOOK III.,"You have your gifts, and I have mine:"
2444,BOOK III.,Where each may in his province shine.
2445,BOOK III.,"Smite you the men; I smite the wenches,"
2446,BOOK III.,And seldom fail to storm their trenches.
2447,BOOK III.,Don't you despise the lover's charms:
2448,BOOK III.,"They're Venus' gift, her powerful arms."
2449,BOOK III.,"A good strong back, and proper measure"
2450,BOOK III.,"Of love, to give the fair ones pleasure,"
2451,BOOK III.,"Are blessings, which the gods bestow"
2452,BOOK III.,Only to favourites below.
2453,BOOK III.,"Yet, if it please thee, I will stand"
2454,BOOK III.,This cuckold's combat hand to hand:
2455,BOOK III.,"His mutton-fist bold Paris scorns,"
2456,BOOK III.,He only fears his branching horns;
2457,BOOK III.,"Should he receive from these a wound,"
2458,BOOK III.,Our quack can never make him sound.
2459,BOOK III.,"But go, explain the matter fully,"
2460,BOOK III.,And I will box this Spartan bully.
2461,BOOK III.,My pretty Nelly shall be set
2462,BOOK III.,For him that doth the conquest get:
2463,BOOK III.,Her swelling breasts and matchless eyes
2464,BOOK III.,Shall be the lucky conqu'ror's prize:
2465,BOOK III.,"Then Troy and Greece, in any weather,"
2466,BOOK III.,May smoke a sober pipe together.
2467,BOOK III.,"This challenge pleas'd, and Hector quick"
2468,BOOK III.,Stopp'd all the Trojans with his stick;
2469,BOOK III.,"Next to the foe, with Spanish pace,"
2470,BOOK III.,"Advanc'd, to let them know the case."
2471,BOOK III.,
2472,BOOK III.,"The Greeks, like coward sons of whores,"
2473,BOOK III.,Threw bricks and cobble-stones in show'rs.
2474,BOOK III.,
2475,BOOK III.,Atrides soon the tumult spies:
2476,BOOK III.,"Give o'er, ye silly dogs! he cries;"
2477,BOOK III.,"'Tis Hector comes, if I am right,"
2478,BOOK III.,"To talk a little, not to fight:"
2479,BOOK III.,"I know him by his breadth of chest,"
2480,BOOK III.,I know his skull-cap's always drest
2481,BOOK III.,With goose quills of the very best:
2482,BOOK III.,"Then be not in such woeful splutter,"
2483,BOOK III.,But hear what Hector has to utter.
2484,BOOK III.,At this rebuke they threw no more:
2485,BOOK III.,The tumult ceas'd; the fray was o'er:
2486,BOOK III.,"His eyes the bully Trojan roll'd,"
2487,BOOK III.,And briefly thus his story told:
2488,BOOK III.,
2489,BOOK III.,"Hear, all ye warriors, fam'd for toils,"
2490,BOOK III.,In civil feuds and drunken broils:
2491,BOOK III.,Paris demands you now forbear
2492,BOOK III.,"To kick and cuff, and curse and swear;"
2493,BOOK III.,"But on the ground your cudgels throw,"
2494,BOOK III.,And stick your broomstaves on a row:
2495,BOOK III.,"Let Troy and Greece but sit 'em down,"
2496,BOOK III.,Paris will fight this Spartan loon;
2497,BOOK III.,"The charming Helen shall be set,"
2498,BOOK III.,For him that shall the conquest get;
2499,BOOK III.,Her snowy breasts and matchless eyes
2500,BOOK III.,Shall be the lucky conqu'ror's prize:
2501,BOOK III.,"Then Troy and Greece, in any weather,"
2502,BOOK III.,May smoke a sober pipe together.
2503,BOOK III.,
2504,BOOK III.,"He spoke; and for six minutes good,"
2505,BOOK III.,"With mouths half-cock'd, both armies stood:"
2506,BOOK III.,
2507,BOOK III.,When Menelaus thus began:
2508,BOOK III.,"Bold Hector offers like a man,"
2509,BOOK III.,And I the challenge will accept;
2510,BOOK III.,As freely as I ever slept.
2511,BOOK III.,"Hector, perhaps, may think I won't,"
2512,BOOK III.,But singe my whiskers if I don't!
2513,BOOK III.,"I know, my lads, you fight for me,"
2514,BOOK III.,And in my quarrel cross'd the sea.
2515,BOOK III.,"I thank you, friends, for what you've done;"
2516,BOOK III.,But now the battle's all my own:
2517,BOOK III.,"Who falls, it matters not a fig,"
2518,BOOK III.,If one survives to dance a jig
2519,BOOK III.,"With that bewitching female Helen,"
2520,BOOK III.,And stump it tightly when he's well in.
2521,BOOK III.,"So, Trojans, if you mean no flams,"
2522,BOOK III.,Go buy directly two grass-lambs;
2523,BOOK III.,"One for the Earth, as black as crow,"
2524,BOOK III.,"One for the Sun, as white as snow:"
2525,BOOK III.,"For surly Jove, you need not fear,"
2526,BOOK III.,"We'll get one, be they cheap or dear;"
2527,BOOK III.,"For well we know he'll make us feel,"
2528,BOOK III.,If e'er we cheat him of a meal.
2529,BOOK III.,But let King Priam on the place
2530,BOOK III.,Appear; we rev'rence his old face.
2531,BOOK III.,"His sons are hect'ring roaring fellows,"
2532,BOOK III.,And fifty thousand lies may tell us;
2533,BOOK III.,"Old age is not so quick in motion,"
2534,BOOK III.,"But sees with care, and moves with caution."
2535,BOOK III.,Experience makes old folks discerning;
2536,BOOK III.,At blunders past they oft take warning.
2537,BOOK III.,
2538,BOOK III.,"Both parties hear, and hope, at last"
2539,BOOK III.,Their broils and broken pates are past;
2540,BOOK III.,"Nor staid they to be bidden twice,"
2541,BOOK III.,But stripp'd their jackets in a trice:
2542,BOOK III.,"Their cudgels, all the circle round"
2543,BOOK III.,As quick as thought threw on the ground.
2544,BOOK III.,"Two beadles Hector sent to town,"
2545,BOOK III.,In haste to fetch his daddy down;
2546,BOOK III.,"And bid 'em tell old limberhams,"
2547,BOOK III.,Not to forget to bring two lambs.
2548,BOOK III.,The running footman of the fleet
2549,BOOK III.,"(Talthybius call'd, with nimble feet)"
2550,BOOK III.,With all his speed his stumps did stir
2551,BOOK III.,To fetch a lamb for Jupiter.
2552,BOOK III.,"I' th' int'rim, fond of mischief-telling,"
2553,BOOK III.,The rainbow goddess flies to Helen:
2554,BOOK III.,"(Most modern farts, I ever knew,"
2555,BOOK III.,"When set on fire, burn only blue,"
2556,BOOK III.,Or simple red; but when behind
2557,BOOK III.,"This nimble goddess lets out wind,"
2558,BOOK III.,It leaves a track along the skies
2559,BOOK III.,Compos'd of fifty different dyes.)
2560,BOOK III.,"She seem'd like old Antenor's daughter,"
2561,BOOK III.,That Helen might not know she sought her.
2562,BOOK III.,"The housewife at her task she found,"
2563,BOOK III.,With all her wenches seated round:
2564,BOOK III.,"For, as she work'd in Priam's hall,"
2565,BOOK III.,She chose to have them within call:
2566,BOOK III.,"Where, like a brazen, saucy jade,"
2567,BOOK III.,She wrought her tale in light and shade:
2568,BOOK III.,"How, for her sake, the Greeks employ"
2569,BOOK III.,Their utmost force to pull down Troy;
2570,BOOK III.,"And wove the story in her loom,"
2571,BOOK III.,"Of horns, her former husband's doom:"
2572,BOOK III.,"Adding withal, to keep her going,"
2573,BOOK III.,What for nine years they had been doing:
2574,BOOK III.,"The necessary names wrote under,"
2575,BOOK III.,Lest lookers-on should make a blunder;
2576,BOOK III.,Lest they should make a wrong conjecture:
2577,BOOK III.,This is brisk Paris--that is Hector;
2578,BOOK III.,This is Ulysses--that the beast
2579,BOOK III.,Thersites--so of all the rest.
2580,BOOK III.,"Helen, says Iris, pray come out"
2581,BOOK III.,And see what work they're all about.
2582,BOOK III.,Their clubs thrown down; their staves they prick
2583,BOOK III.,"Fast in the ground, and there they stick."
2584,BOOK III.,They fight no more; for this good day
2585,BOOK III.,Paris and Menelaus say
2586,BOOK III.,They'll have one bout at cudgel play.
2587,BOOK III.,These happy rogues appear in view
2588,BOOK III.,To box their very best for you;
2589,BOOK III.,"And which soever of 'em win,"
2590,BOOK III.,With kissing he will soon begin.
2591,BOOK III.,This put the light-heel'd dame in mind
2592,BOOK III.,Of people she had left behind
2593,BOOK III.,In her own country: not these two
2594,BOOK III.,(She'd try'd the best that they could do);
2595,BOOK III.,But she had left behind some dozens
2596,BOOK III.,"Of uncles, aunts, and loving cousins."
2597,BOOK III.,"She gulp'd, and swallow'd down her spittle,"
2598,BOOK III.,But yet was seen to weep a little;
2599,BOOK III.,"Then left her work, and on her wait"
2600,BOOK III.,"Two wenches to the Scean gate,"
2601,BOOK III.,"Where some old square-toes, grave and try'd,"
2602,BOOK III.,Were chatting close to Priam's side:
2603,BOOK III.,I think they were in number seven;
2604,BOOK III.,"It matters not, or odd or even."
2605,BOOK III.,"The name of each I would rehearse,"
2606,BOOK III.,But it would edge your teeth in verse.
2607,BOOK III.,"Like grasshoppers they sat i' th' sun,"
2608,BOOK III.,Telling strange tales of ancient fun;
2609,BOOK III.,"And, in a feeble hollow tone,"
2610,BOOK III.,Repeated what great feats they'd done;
2611,BOOK III.,"How they had thrum'd the maids of Troy,"
2612,BOOK III.,When Adam was a little boy:
2613,BOOK III.,At Helen's shapes they shook their wings;
2614,BOOK III.,What could they more? they had no stings.
2615,BOOK III.,
2616,BOOK III.,"No wonder, 'faith, they cry, that Greece"
2617,BOOK III.,Should fight for such a tempting piece;
2618,BOOK III.,"The man that Helen's ringlets touzes,"
2619,BOOK III.,Can never grudge a thousand bruises;
2620,BOOK III.,"But since 'tis o'er with us long since,"
2621,BOOK III.,'Tis best to send the brimstone hence:
2622,BOOK III.,"If she stays here, Troy tumbles down;"
2623,BOOK III.,"But pack her off, we save the town."
2624,BOOK III.,
2625,BOOK III.,"Whilst thus the gipsy's praise they squeak,"
2626,BOOK III.,The Trojan king began to speak:
2627,BOOK III.,
2628,BOOK III.,"Come hither, girl, I take a pride"
2629,BOOK III.,To have thee chatter by my side.
2630,BOOK III.,"Behold your friends, my dearest honey,"
2631,BOOK III.,And take a view of your old crony.
2632,BOOK III.,'Tis not your fault: you're not the cause
2633,BOOK III.,"Of half our bruises, kicks, and blows."
2634,BOOK III.,"The gods, they say, are in a pet;"
2635,BOOK III.,And when they're once on mischief set
2636,BOOK III.,"The devil cannot keep 'em down,"
2637,BOOK III.,Till they've demolish'd some old town;
2638,BOOK III.,"And for nine years, I plainly see,"
2639,BOOK III.,They have been grumbling hard at me.
2640,BOOK III.,"But tell us, who's that swinging fellow"
2641,BOOK III.,"That struts so fierce? he's drest in yellow,"
2642,BOOK III.,"And cocks his hat with such a pinch,"
2643,BOOK III.,He looks a soldier ev'ry inch.
2644,BOOK III.,
2645,BOOK III.,"Helen replies, Although, good Priam,"
2646,BOOK III.,"No woman's better kiss'd than I am,"
2647,BOOK III.,"Yet I could wish I had been hang'd,"
2648,BOOK III.,"Or at a whipping-post well bang'd,"
2649,BOOK III.,"Ere I away with Paris ran,"
2650,BOOK III.,And cuckolded an honest man:
2651,BOOK III.,"My little girl most bitterly,"
2652,BOOK III.,"They tell me, for her mam doth cry:"
2653,BOOK III.,"I'm full of grief, if that would do;"
2654,BOOK III.,But matters can't be mended now.
2655,BOOK III.,
2656,BOOK III.,"The gipsy, after this parade,"
2657,BOOK III.,Thus to the good old Trojan said:
2658,BOOK III.,"He whom to know my daddy seeks,"
2659,BOOK III.,Is the great leader of the Greeks:
2660,BOOK III.,
2661,BOOK III.,"His fame is known both near and far,"
2662,BOOK III.,"To scold in peace, and kick in war:"
2663,BOOK III.,"My brother he was call'd, before"
2664,BOOK III.,Your son and I turn'd rogue and whore:
2665,BOOK III.,"To call him so I'm now asham'd,"
2666,BOOK III.,And even blush to hear him nam'd.
2667,BOOK III.,
2668,BOOK III.,"Is that Atrides, quoth the king?"
2669,BOOK III.,To me he seems the very thing:
2670,BOOK III.,"I'm told he is, or grave or mellow,"
2671,BOOK III.,"In peace or war, a clever fellow."
2672,BOOK III.,Amongst the Phrygians I have been.
2673,BOOK III.,But ne'er a tighter fellow seen.
2674,BOOK III.,"When Otreus sat upon their throne,"
2675,BOOK III.,"And Migdon led their hang-dogs on,"
2676,BOOK III.,I and my Trojans join'd the roysters;
2677,BOOK III.,"Where, by the help of cod and oysters,"
2678,BOOK III.,"We laid, with many strokes and thwacks,"
2679,BOOK III.,The Amazons upon their backs:
2680,BOOK III.,Yet those now standing in our sight
2681,BOOK III.,"Are tighter fellows, by this light."
2682,BOOK III.,"But tell me, Helen, if you can,"
2683,BOOK III.,Who's that broad-breasted little man;
2684,BOOK III.,"His shoulders large and widely spread,"
2685,BOOK III.,But not so tall as th' last by th' head?
2686,BOOK III.,"He is no serjeant, I've a notion;"
2687,BOOK III.,Yet like a serjeant in his motion:
2688,BOOK III.,He seems to bustle much about him;
2689,BOOK III.,You'd swear they could not do without him.
2690,BOOK III.,
2691,BOOK III.,"Helen replies, My judgment misses,"
2692,BOOK III.,If he you speak of ben't Ulysses.
2693,BOOK III.,"Now that I take a better view,"
2694,BOOK III.,"'Tis he himself, I spy him now:"
2695,BOOK III.,"Let him be standing still, or running,"
2696,BOOK III.,You'll hardly find his match for cunning;
2697,BOOK III.,"He knows a thousand slipp'ry tricks,"
2698,BOOK III.,But shines the most in politics.
2699,BOOK III.,"Though from a barren isle he came,"
2700,BOOK III.,The world's too little for his fame:
2701,BOOK III.,"And, had he not been born a prince,"
2702,BOOK III.,He'd been prime minister long since.
2703,BOOK III.,
2704,BOOK III.,"Antenor told the king, he knew"
2705,BOOK III.,What Helen said was very true.
2706,BOOK III.,"When Atreus' son and he came over,"
2707,BOOK III.,"This coaxing baggage to recover,"
2708,BOOK III.,"Men of great worth they seem'd to be,"
2709,BOOK III.,I therefore let 'em lodge with me:
2710,BOOK III.,"I knew them both before that day,"
2711,BOOK III.,And knew they could their reck'ning pay.
2712,BOOK III.,Whene'er we chatted o'er a can
2713,BOOK III.,"Of flip, with care I mark'd each man."
2714,BOOK III.,"Atrides standing, look'd the best,"
2715,BOOK III.,'Cause he was mostly better drest:
2716,BOOK III.,"Seated, Ulysses reverence drew;"
2717,BOOK III.,On breech he gave the clearest view.
2718,BOOK III.,Atrides was no man of tongue;
2719,BOOK III.,"His speech was good, though never long:"
2720,BOOK III.,"But when Ulysses 'gan to speak,"
2721,BOOK III.,You never heard so queer a Greek;
2722,BOOK III.,"He'd fix his eyes upon the ground,"
2723,BOOK III.,As if a speech could there be found;
2724,BOOK III.,"Look'd foolish, though he knew no tongue"
2725,BOOK III.,Like his was half so glibly hung:
2726,BOOK III.,"He could, with oily words, I tell ye,"
2727,BOOK III.,Make your heart jump within your belly:
2728,BOOK III.,His rogueship from the flowers and trees
2729,BOOK III.,Would call the very birds and bees.
2730,BOOK III.,
2731,BOOK III.,Then Priam thus: Amidst the throng
2732,BOOK III.,I spy a man exceeding strong;
2733,BOOK III.,"Shoulders so spread, and such a chest,"
2734,BOOK III.,He's stole a giant's back and breast:
2735,BOOK III.,So strong a carl you'll seldom see;
2736,BOOK III.,"My lovely girl, who can it be?"
2737,BOOK III.,"Ajax, replies fair Leda's daughter,"
2738,BOOK III.,Is he you're now inquiring after:
2739,BOOK III.,"Of him the Grecians well may crack,"
2740,BOOK III.,For he upon his brawny back
2741,BOOK III.,"Could lug the city gates, when bid,"
2742,BOOK III.,As well as ever Samson did.
2743,BOOK III.,"The next that looks this way to see us,"
2744,BOOK III.,Is the far-fam'd Idomeneus:
2745,BOOK III.,"With my good man he once took quarter,"
2746,BOOK III.,"And look'd so trim, my mouth did water."
2747,BOOK III.,"As for the rest, if I judge rightly,"
2748,BOOK III.,They're fellows that can box it tightly.
2749,BOOK III.,"But all this while, old dad, have I"
2750,BOOK III.,"Been looking sharp, if I can spy"
2751,BOOK III.,"A pair of twins, and each my brother"
2752,BOOK III.,"Castor is one, and Pollux t'other."
2753,BOOK III.,"But hap the colonels fight no more,"
2754,BOOK III.,Or scorn to quarrel for a whore.
2755,BOOK III.,
2756,BOOK III.,"Poor Helen dreamt not on her bed,"
2757,BOOK III.,Her brothers were as herrings dead;
2758,BOOK III.,That the last doublet they put on
2759,BOOK III.,"Was made of Bath or Portland stone,"
2760,BOOK III.,"Where, free from broils, they slept secure,"
2761,BOOK III.,And dreamt of whores and rogues no more.
2762,BOOK III.,And now both beadles did with care
2763,BOOK III.,The lambs for sacrifice prepare;
2764,BOOK III.,"But first in order form the ring,"
2765,BOOK III.,And thus they call the Trojan king:
2766,BOOK III.,
2767,BOOK III.,"Arise, O king! come down with speed."
2768,BOOK III.,And lend a hand in time of need
2769,BOOK III.,"To seal the truce; for there's no troth,"
2770,BOOK III.,Unless you come and take the oath.
2771,BOOK III.,Your son and famous Menelau
2772,BOOK III.,For Nell agree to pull a crow:
2773,BOOK III.,"And he that makes his rival yield,"
2774,BOOK III.,"Or lays him flat upon the field,"
2775,BOOK III.,"May unmolested take his fill,"
2776,BOOK III.,And tousel Helen when he will;
2777,BOOK III.,"That we may cease this curs'd fatigue,"
2778,BOOK III.,And join in everlasting league;
2779,BOOK III.,"Trojans may plough their lands, and Greece"
2780,BOOK III.,"Return, and kiss their wives in peace."
2781,BOOK III.,
2782,BOOK III.,"Priam, though with a heavy heart,"
2783,BOOK III.,"Gave orders for his apple-cart,"
2784,BOOK III.,A vehicle contriv'd with care
2785,BOOK III.,To serve for cart or one-horse chair;
2786,BOOK III.,"Then, with Antenor by his side,"
2787,BOOK III.,Like two grave cits they took a ride
2788,BOOK III.,"Quite through the Scean gate, among"
2789,BOOK III.,The Trojan and the Grecian throng:
2790,BOOK III.,"When Agamemnon 'midst the crew,"
2791,BOOK III.,"And eke the sly Ulysses too,"
2792,BOOK III.,"Both rose, and made a handsome bow."
2793,BOOK III.,"And now the blue-coat beadles, grac'd"
2794,BOOK III.,"With large red caps all silver-lac'd,"
2795,BOOK III.,"The method of the farce to fix,"
2796,BOOK III.,Some Greek and Trojan beverage mix;
2797,BOOK III.,Then pour a little on the hand
2798,BOOK III.,"Of each commander, as they stand;"
2799,BOOK III.,"But have our priestly way of thinking,"
2800,BOOK III.,To save the most for private drinking:
2801,BOOK III.,"Lastly,--this grand affair to close,"
2802,BOOK III.,"His knife the Grecian gen'ral draws,"
2803,BOOK III.,"And cutting from the beasts some hair,"
2804,BOOK III.,"The beadles gave each chief a share,"
2805,BOOK III.,To show that all things should be fair.
2806,BOOK III.,"Then with a thund'ring voice, that made"
2807,BOOK III.,"A dev'lish noise, to Jove they pray'd:"
2808,BOOK III.,
2809,BOOK III.,O Jupiter! who every Friday
2810,BOOK III.,Art worshipp'd on a mount call'd Ida:
2811,BOOK III.,O Phœbus! and thou mother Earth!
2812,BOOK III.,That gives to thieves and lawyers birth:
2813,BOOK III.,O demons! and infernal furies!
2814,BOOK III.,Whose counsels aid Westminster juries:
2815,BOOK III.,Thou discord-making fiend I that trudges
2816,BOOK III.,The six months' circuits with the judges;
2817,BOOK III.,"And thou, the hellish imp, that brings"
2818,BOOK III.,Brimstone to singe all wicked kings!
2819,BOOK III.,"Hear what we promise, and depend on't,"
2820,BOOK III.,"We'll keep our words, or mark the end on't."
2821,BOOK III.,Should Paris drub this Menelaus;
2822,BOOK III.,"To pox and poverty betray us,"
2823,BOOK III.,If we don't leave the brimstone Helen
2824,BOOK III.,Safe in her present Trojan dwelling
2825,BOOK III.,"For Paris' use! Much good may't do him,"
2826,BOOK III.,And make her true and faithful to him;
2827,BOOK III.,"Whilst we poor devils will depart,"
2828,BOOK III.,And trudge it home with all our heart.
2829,BOOK III.,But if by Menelaus' blows
2830,BOOK III.,"Paris should get a bloody nose,"
2831,BOOK III.,"They shall again restore his Nelly,"
2832,BOOK III.,With what belongs her back and belly;
2833,BOOK III.,A forfeit too consent to pay
2834,BOOK III.,For stealing of the girl away;
2835,BOOK III.,And Paris cannot think it much
2836,BOOK III.,To pay a piece for every touch:
2837,BOOK III.,"If they refuse, again we'll fight,"
2838,BOOK III.,And force the rogues to do us right.
2839,BOOK III.,With that he seiz'd the sheep by th' crown.
2840,BOOK III.,And cut their throats or knock'd them down
2841,BOOK III.,"By death they soon were overtaken,"
2842,BOOK III.,Though they kick'd hard to save their bacon.
2843,BOOK III.,"The chiefs then tipp'd, the other round,"
2844,BOOK III.,And pour'd a little on the ground;
2845,BOOK III.,"Adding withal a shorter prayer,"
2846,BOOK III.,Because they'd not much time to spare:
2847,BOOK III.,"Hear, Jove, and all ye gods on high!"
2848,BOOK III.,Whose vicars say you hate a lie
2849,BOOK III.,"(Though amongst them, for lies and swearing,"
2850,BOOK III.,"There's scarce a barrel better herring),"
2851,BOOK III.,"Whoever takes a thing in hand,"
2852,BOOK III.,"And will not to their bargain stand,"
2853,BOOK III.,May their heart's blood run out much quicker
2854,BOOK III.,Than from the jug we pour this liquor;
2855,BOOK III.,"And may their wives such harlots be,"
2856,BOOK III.,That a whole parish can't serve three!
2857,BOOK III.,"Thus both the armies clubb'd a prayer,"
2858,BOOK III.,"Which Jove refus'd, and kick'd in air."
2859,BOOK III.,"Now, when these popish rites were done,"
2860,BOOK III.,Old square-toes hasten'd to be gone:
2861,BOOK III.,
2862,BOOK III.,"It will be rather hard, quoth he,"
2863,BOOK III.,"For one so very old as me,"
2864,BOOK III.,Bruises and broken pates to see:
2865,BOOK III.,"But Jove knows best, who rules us all,"
2866,BOOK III.,"Which knave shall stand, or which shall fall."
2867,BOOK III.,"To stay within yond' walls I choose,"
2868,BOOK III.,And be the last to hear bad news:
2869,BOOK III.,Then instantly his chair ascended;
2870,BOOK III.,Antenor by his side attended:
2871,BOOK III.,"But first, and rightly did he judge it,"
2872,BOOK III.,He stuff'd both lambs within his budget.
2873,BOOK III.,
2874,BOOK III.,"Ulysses then, and Hector stout,"
2875,BOOK III.,The limits of the fight mark'd out:
2876,BOOK III.,They both agreed that chance might try
2877,BOOK III.,Who first should let his broomstick fly.
2878,BOOK III.,"The people pray on bended knees,"
2879,BOOK III.,And mutter out such words as these:
2880,BOOK III.,
2881,BOOK III.,O Jupiter! who hast by odds
2882,BOOK III.,"The greatest head of all the gods,"
2883,BOOK III.,Let him that did this mischief brew
2884,BOOK III.,Return with ribs all black and blue;
2885,BOOK III.,"Or let him be demolish'd quick,"
2886,BOOK III.,And sent full gallop to Old Nick!
2887,BOOK III.,"Such rogues once hang'd, all wars would cease,"
2888,BOOK III.,And soldiers eat their bread in peace.
2889,BOOK III.,
2890,BOOK III.,"[Illustration: Book III, page 153."
2891,BOOK III.,"Hector, who was a wary chap"

2895,BOOK III.,
2896,BOOK III.,"Hector, who was a wary chap"
2897,BOOK III.,"At pitch and chuck, or hustle-cap,"
2898,BOOK III.,"An old Scotch bonnet quickly takes,"
2899,BOOK III.,In which he three brass farthings shakes:
2900,BOOK III.,"Then turn'd his head without deceit,"
2901,BOOK III.,To show them that he scorn'd to cheat;
2902,BOOK III.,"And cries aloud, Here goes, my boy,"
2903,BOOK III.,"'Tis heads for Greece, and tails for Troy;"
2904,BOOK III.,"Then turns the cap: Great Troy prevails,"
2905,BOOK III.,"Two farthings out of three were tails,"
2906,BOOK III.,"Paris now arms himself in haste,"
2907,BOOK III.,And ty'd his jacket round his waist
2908,BOOK III.,"With a buff belt, and then with 'traps"
2909,BOOK III.,About his legs some hay-bands wraps;
2910,BOOK III.,To guard his heart he closely press'd
2911,BOOK III.,A sheet of tin athwart his breast;
2912,BOOK III.,His trusty sword across his breech
2913,BOOK III.,"Was hung, to be within his reach;"
2914,BOOK III.,"A horse's tail, just like a mop,"
2915,BOOK III.,He stuck upon his scull-cap's top.
2916,BOOK III.,"Thus arm'd complete, with care and skill,"
2917,BOOK III.,He seem'd as stout as Bobadil:
2918,BOOK III.,"And Menelaus, you might see,"
2919,BOOK III.,Appear'd as stout and fierce as he.
2920,BOOK III.,"Ready for fight, they both look'd sour,"
2921,BOOK III.,And eyed each other o'er and o'er.
2922,BOOK III.,"Paris puts on a warlike phiz,"
2923,BOOK III.,"And from his hand his staff goes whiz,"
2924,BOOK III.,"Which lent the Grecian targe a thump,"
2925,BOOK III.,And then upon the ground fell plump.
2926,BOOK III.,"His broomstaff then, with aim as true,"
2927,BOOK III.,The cuckold at the Trojan threw;
2928,BOOK III.,"But ere he spent his ammunition,"
2929,BOOK III.,He sent to Jove a small petition:
2930,BOOK III.,
2931,BOOK III.,"Mayst please my good design to help,"
2932,BOOK III.,And let me souse this lech'rous whelp;
2933,BOOK III.,"That men may cease to do amiss,"
2934,BOOK III.,And not in others' fish-ponds fish!
2935,BOOK III.,"Thus, like Old Noll, he coin'd a pray'r,"
2936,BOOK III.,Then sent his broomstick through the air
2937,BOOK III.,"With such a vengeance did it fall,"
2938,BOOK III.,"Through the tin-plates it bor'd a hole,"
2939,BOOK III.,And tore his doublet and his shirt;
2940,BOOK III.,But to his guts did little hurt;
2941,BOOK III.,"Because the knave, by bending low,"
2942,BOOK III.,Escap'd the fury of the blow.
2943,BOOK III.,"Some think he daub'd his breeks that hit,"
2944,BOOK III.,But that remains a query yet.
2945,BOOK III.,"The Greek, who did not often judge ill,"
2946,BOOK III.,"Pursu'd th' advantage with his cudgel,"
2947,BOOK III.,"And laid about at such a rate,"
2948,BOOK III.,As if he meant to break his pate;
2949,BOOK III.,"But, as his jobber-noul he rapp'd,"
2950,BOOK III.,His stick in twenty pieces snapp'd.
2951,BOOK III.,"Vex'd to the guts, he lifts his eyes,"
2952,BOOK III.,"And mutt'ring to himself, he cries:"
2953,BOOK III.,
2954,BOOK III.,"This rascal's jacket I had dusted,"
2955,BOOK III.,If Jupiter could have been trusted;
2956,BOOK III.,"But honest men he keeps at distance,"
2957,BOOK III.,And lends to whores and rogues assistance.
2958,BOOK III.,"Just when I had secur'd my prize,"
2959,BOOK III.,My lousy stick in pieces flies.
2960,BOOK III.,"This said, he gave a hasty snap"
2961,BOOK III.,"At the horse-tail upon his cap,"
2962,BOOK III.,"And lugg'd most stoutly at his crown,"
2963,BOOK III.,In hopes to pull the varlet down:
2964,BOOK III.,"The more he lugg'd to end the farce,"
2965,BOOK III.,The more the Trojan hung an arse:
2966,BOOK III.,"Still he haul'd on with many a bob,"
2967,BOOK III.,"And certainly had done his job,"
2968,BOOK III.,Because so firmly was his cap
2969,BOOK III.,"Ty'd with a tinsel'd leather strap,"
2970,BOOK III.,"That though the knave began to cough,"
2971,BOOK III.,The de'il a bit would it come off:
2972,BOOK III.,"But watchful Venus came in season,"
2973,BOOK III.,Before the Greek had stopp'd his weasand;
2974,BOOK III.,"Her scissars from her side she whipp'd,"
2975,BOOK III.,And in a twink the stay-band snipp'd.
2976,BOOK III.,"The Greek, who thought he well had sped,"
2977,BOOK III.,"And pull'd off both his cap and head,"
2978,BOOK III.,"Was vex'd to find, instead of full cap,"
2979,BOOK III.,He'd only got an empty skull-cap:
2980,BOOK III.,"In grievous wrath, away he threw it."
2981,BOOK III.,
2982,BOOK III.,"[Illustration: Book III, page 157."
2983,BOOK III.,"But watchful Venus came in season,"
2984,BOOK III.,Before the Greek had stopp'd his weasand;

2987,BOOK III.,
2988,BOOK III.,"Amongst his men, who flock'd to view it,"
2989,BOOK III.,"Admir'd the glitt'ring band, and swore"
2990,BOOK III.,They'd never seen the like before.
2991,BOOK III.,
2992,BOOK III.,"He then, with all his might and main,"
2993,BOOK III.,Let drive at Paris once again;
2994,BOOK III.,"With a fresh broomstick thought to smoke him,"
2995,BOOK III.,"But Venus whipp'd him up, and took him"
2996,BOOK III.,"In her smock lap, and very soon"
2997,BOOK III.,Near his own dwelling set him down;
2998,BOOK III.,"From thence, with gentle touch, she led"
2999,BOOK III.,"The younker home, and warm'd his bed."
3000,BOOK III.,"To take away perfumes not good,"
3001,BOOK III.,She burnt perfumes of spicy wood.
3002,BOOK III.,
3003,BOOK III.,No sooner was he seated well in
3004,BOOK III.,"His garret, but she look'd for Helen:"
3005,BOOK III.,Amongst her chamber-maids she found her;
3006,BOOK III.,The wenches all were standing round her.
3007,BOOK III.,"Quickly she chang'd her form, and whipp'd on"
3008,BOOK III.,The nose and chin of Mother Shipton;
3009,BOOK III.,"Then on her tip-toes coming near,"
3010,BOOK III.,She whispers softly in her ear:
3011,BOOK III.,
3012,BOOK III.,"My dearest jewel, Paris wants"
3013,BOOK III.,To ramble in the usual haunts;
3014,BOOK III.,"Upon a good flock-bed he lies,"
3015,BOOK III.,And longs to view your wicked eyes:
3016,BOOK III.,"The whoring rascal, safe and sound,"
3017,BOOK III.,Prepares to fire a double round.
3018,BOOK III.,
3019,BOOK III.,Helen began to make a din
3020,BOOK III.,"At this old woman's nose and chin,"
3021,BOOK III.,"But as she star'd her through and through,"
3022,BOOK III.,Her old acquaintance soon she knew
3023,BOOK III.,"By her fine alabaster bubbies,"
3024,BOOK III.,"Her eyes of jet, and lips of rubies."
3025,BOOK III.,"The fright made all her teeth to chatter,"
3026,BOOK III.,"And, 'faith, she scarce could hold her water:"
3027,BOOK III.,"But soon a little courage took,"
3028,BOOK III.,And to the goddess silence broke
3029,BOOK III.,"(The reader in her speech will find,"
3030,BOOK III.,"That, woman like, she spoke her mind):"
3031,BOOK III.,
3032,BOOK III.,Could I believe that Venus would
3033,BOOK III.,For such a rascal turn a bawd?
3034,BOOK III.,"Don't think that Helen e'er will truckle,"
3035,BOOK III.,And with a beaten scoundrel buckle.
3036,BOOK III.,"If to your calling you bewitch her,"
3037,BOOK III.,"For God's sake let a brave man switch her,"
3038,BOOK III.,Nor think that I can like a scrub
3039,BOOK III.,That any lousy rogue can drub.
3040,BOOK III.,"Now he is worsted in the fight,"
3041,BOOK III.,I am become another's right:
3042,BOOK III.,I know your drift; it sha'n't take place;
3043,BOOK III.,"To send me homeward with disgrace,"
3044,BOOK III.,And make my husband quite uncivil:
3045,BOOK III.,You a fine goddess! you a devil!
3046,BOOK III.,If Paris cannot live without
3047,BOOK III.,"A tit bit, you yourself may do't;"
3048,BOOK III.,"Be you his loving wench or wife,"
3049,BOOK III.,"I'll go no more, upon my life:"
3050,BOOK III.,"To me it will afford no sport,"
3051,BOOK III.,I am not in a humour for't;
3052,BOOK III.,"You're always ready for a bout,"
3053,BOOK III.,When I'd as lief be hang'd as do't:
3054,BOOK III.,"But know, that I'll no longer bear"
3055,BOOK III.,"Of every saucy jade the sneer,"
3056,BOOK III.,"Who cry, She's very handsome, sure,"
3057,BOOK III.,But yet the brim's an errant whore.
3058,BOOK III.,
3059,BOOK III.,"Hey-day! quoth Venus, what's all this?"
3060,BOOK III.,On nettles sure you've been to piss:
3061,BOOK III.,"Yon will not that, or t'other do:"
3062,BOOK III.,"Pray, who will first have cause to rue?"
3063,BOOK III.,"If I forsake thee, every grace"
3064,BOOK III.,Will leave that pretty smirking face;
3065,BOOK III.,Trojans won't give a fig to see
3066,BOOK III.,What once they view'd with so much glee;
3067,BOOK III.,Nor will the wildest rake in town
3068,BOOK III.,"Value thy ware at half a crown,"
3069,BOOK III.,
3070,BOOK III.,"This eas'd poor Helen of her doubts,"
3071,BOOK III.,And put an end to all disputes;
3072,BOOK III.,"Rather than risk the loss of beauty,"
3073,BOOK III.,She'd be content with double duty;
3074,BOOK III.,"On which the gipsies tripp'd away,"
3075,BOOK III.,And soon arriv'd where Paris lay.
3076,BOOK III.,"The maids about like lightning flew,"
3077,BOOK III.,For they had fifty things to do:
3078,BOOK III.,But Nell and Venus mount up stairs;
3079,BOOK III.,They were to mind their own affairs.
3080,BOOK III.,"Soon as they reach'd the garret-door,"
3081,BOOK III.,The goddess tripp'd it in before;
3082,BOOK III.,"And, squatting down just by the fire,"
3083,BOOK III.,Made Helen on a stool sit by her:
3084,BOOK III.,"All o'er she look'd so very charming,"
3085,BOOK III.,That Paris found his liver warming;
3086,BOOK III.,"He seiz'd her, and began to play"
3087,BOOK III.,The prelude to <i>et cætera</i>;
3088,BOOK III.,Hoping a tune o' th' silent flute
3089,BOOK III.,Would keep the scolding baggage mute:
3090,BOOK III.,Instead of which the vixen fell
3091,BOOK III.,Upon the harmless rogue pell mell.
3092,BOOK III.,
3093,BOOK III.,"After you've suffer'd such disgrace,"
3094,BOOK III.,How dare you look in Helen's face?
3095,BOOK III.,"What wench, now thou hast lost thine honour,"
3096,BOOK III.,Will let thee lay a leg upon her?
3097,BOOK III.,Perhaps you think I'll suffer you
3098,BOOK III.,"To toy, but split me if I do;"
3099,BOOK III.,"Not I, by Jove. Are all thy brags,"
3100,BOOK III.,"Of beating Menelaus to rags,"
3101,BOOK III.,Come off with this? Once more go try
3102,BOOK III.,Thy strength--But what a fool am I!
3103,BOOK III.,"A stripling thou, a giant he;"
3104,BOOK III.,At single gulp he'd swallow thee.
3105,BOOK III.,Then venture into scrapes no more;
3106,BOOK III.,"But, since thou'rt safe, e'en shut the door."
3107,BOOK III.,
3108,BOOK III.,"Paris replies, Good dame, ha' done;"
3109,BOOK III.,We can't recall the setting sun:
3110,BOOK III.,"Though your old cuckold-pated whelp,"
3111,BOOK III.,"By that damn'd brim Minerva's help,"
3112,BOOK III.,"Did win this match, the next that's try'd"
3113,BOOK III.,I'll lay the odds I trim his hide.
3114,BOOK III.,"But haste, my girl, let's buckle to't,"
3115,BOOK III.,And mind the business we're about:
3116,BOOK III.,I ne'er before had such desire;
3117,BOOK III.,My heart and pluck are both on fire:
3118,BOOK III.,"Just now I've far more appetite,"
3119,BOOK III.,"Than when with you, that merry night,"
3120,BOOK III.,"In Cranse's isle, to work we buckled,"
3121,BOOK III.,And dubb'd your bluff-fac'd husband cuckold.
3122,BOOK III.,
3123,BOOK III.,"This speech no sooner had he made,"
3124,BOOK III.,But up he jump'd upon the bed;
3125,BOOK III.,Where Nelly soon resign'd her charms.
3126,BOOK III.,And sunk into the varlet's arms:
3127,BOOK III.,"Around her waist he never caught her,"
3128,BOOK III.,But it in special temper brought her.
3129,BOOK III.,
3130,BOOK III.,"Whilst thus they up and down engage,"
3131,BOOK III.,The Greek was in a bloody rage;
3132,BOOK III.,"He like a pointer rang'd about,"
3133,BOOK III.,"To try to find the younker out,"
3134,BOOK III.,"And peep'd in ev'ry hole and corner,"
3135,BOOK III.,In hopes to spy this Mr. Horner;
3136,BOOK III.,"(Nor would the Trojans, not to wrong 'em,"
3137,BOOK III.,"Have screen'd him, had he been among 'em)"
3138,BOOK III.,But the bawd Venus took good care
3139,BOOK III.,He should not find him far or near.
3140,BOOK III.,Then Agamemnon from his breech
3141,BOOK III.,"Lifted himself, and made this speech:"
3142,BOOK III.,
3143,BOOK III.,"Ye Dardans and ye Trojans trusty,"
3144,BOOK III.,"Whose swords we keep from being rusty,"
3145,BOOK III.,You plainly see the higher powers
3146,BOOK III.,Determine that the day is ours;
3147,BOOK III.,"For Menelaus sure has beat him,"
3148,BOOK III.,"And may, for aught we know, have eat him,"
3149,BOOK III.,"As not a man upon the spot,"
3150,BOOK III.,Can tell us where the rogue is got:
3151,BOOK III.,"If therefore Helen you'll restore,"
3152,BOOK III.,"We'll take her, be she wife or whore,"
3153,BOOK III.,"With all her clothes and other gear,"
3154,BOOK III.,Adding a sum for wear and tear:
3155,BOOK III.,"The wear, a female broker may"
3156,BOOK III.,Settle in less than half a day;
3157,BOOK III.,"But for the tear, no mortal elf"
3158,BOOK III.,Can judge so well as Mene's self.
3159,BOOK III.,"If Troy will pay a fine so just,"
3160,BOOK III.,"And that they will, I firmly trust,"
3161,BOOK III.,"We'll leave this curs'd unlucky shore,"
3162,BOOK III.,And swear to trouble you no more.
3163,BOOK III.,
3164,BOOK III.,With mighty shouts the Grecians each
3165,BOOK III.,Vow 'tis a very noble speech;
3166,BOOK III.,That every single word was right;
3167,BOOK III.,And swore the Trojans should stand by't.

3326,BOOK IV.,They kill good store of bulls and cows;

3361,BOOK IV.,"She'll soon, if you unloose her tether,"
3362,BOOK IV.,Set Greece and Troy by th' ears together:
3363,BOOK IV.,"But bid her use her utmost care,"
3364,BOOK IV.,Troy's whoring sons begin the war;
3365,BOOK IV.,"Then, if they get the worst o' th' game,"
3366,BOOK IV.,They dare not say that we're to blame.
3367,BOOK IV.,
3368,BOOK IV.,Of heaven and earth the whoring king
3369,BOOK IV.,Swore that his wife had hit the thing:
3370,BOOK IV.,"Then go, my Pallas, in the nick,"
3371,BOOK IV.,And serve these Phrygian whelps a trick;
3372,BOOK IV.,"Make 'em, like Frenchmen, treaties break:"
3373,BOOK IV.,"Away, and do not stay to speak."
3374,BOOK IV.,
3375,BOOK IV.,"Pleas'd she darts downward in a trice,"
3376,BOOK IV.,And smooth as younkers slide on ice;
3377,BOOK IV.,Or when the upper regions vomit
3378,BOOK IV.,"A long-tail'd firebrand, call'd a comet,"
3379,BOOK IV.,"Which robs old women of their wits,"
3380,BOOK IV.,And frights their daughters into fits;
3381,BOOK IV.,"Gives wond'ring loons the belly-ache,"
3382,BOOK IV.,And makes the valiant soldier quake:
3383,BOOK IV.,"With horrid whiz it falls from high,"
3384,BOOK IV.,And whisks its tail along the sky:
3385,BOOK IV.,"Just so this brimstone did appear,"
3386,BOOK IV.,As she shot downward through the air.
3387,BOOK IV.,"They guess'd, and paus'd, and guess'd again,"
3388,BOOK IV.,What this strange prodigy could mean:
3389,BOOK IV.,"At last agreed, that angry Fate"
3390,BOOK IV.,Was big with something mighty great.
3391,BOOK IV.,"'Twas war, or peace, or wind, or rain,"
3392,BOOK IV.,Or scarcity next year of grain.
3393,BOOK IV.,"Some cunning heads this reason hit,"
3394,BOOK IV.,That B--e would soon make room for P--tt;
3395,BOOK IV.,But all the bold north-country rout
3396,BOOK IV.,Swore that it would much better suit
3397,BOOK IV.,"His M----, to stick to B--te."
3398,BOOK IV.,
3399,BOOK IV.,"Whilst thus they jar and disagree,"
3400,BOOK IV.,Minerva lit behind a tree;
3401,BOOK IV.,"And lest her phiz should make 'em gape,"
3402,BOOK IV.,Borrow'd an honest mortal shape;
3403,BOOK IV.,"Laodocus, no snivelling dastard,"
3404,BOOK IV.,But great Antenor's nephew's bastard:
3405,BOOK IV.,"She quickly found Lycaon's son,"
3406,BOOK IV.,"A rare strong chief for back and bone,"
3407,BOOK IV.,"Whose troops from black Esopee came,"
3408,BOOK IV.,A place but little known to fame.
3409,BOOK IV.,The arms his raggamuffins bore
3410,BOOK IV.,Were broomsticks daub'd with blood all o'er.
3411,BOOK IV.,"To him she with a harmless look,"
3412,BOOK IV.,"Like a mischievous brimstone, spoke:"
3413,BOOK IV.,
3414,BOOK IV.,"Will you, friend Pand'rus, says she,"
3415,BOOK IV.,A little counsel take from me?
3416,BOOK IV.,You know that every prudent man
3417,BOOK IV.,Should pick up money when he can;
3418,BOOK IV.,"And now, if you could have the luck"
3419,BOOK IV.,"To make a hole in Sparta's pluck,"
3420,BOOK IV.,"Paris, as certain as I live,"
3421,BOOK IV.,Would any sum of money give.
3422,BOOK IV.,Such a bold push must sure be crown'd
3423,BOOK IV.,"With ten, at least, or twenty pound:"
3424,BOOK IV.,"Don't gape and stare, for now or never"
3425,BOOK IV.,You gain or lose the cash for ever:
3426,BOOK IV.,"But first, to th' Lycian archer pay"
3427,BOOK IV.,(By most he's call'd the god of day)
3428,BOOK IV.,A ram; this same unerring spark
3429,BOOK IV.,Can guide thy arrow to its mark:
3430,BOOK IV.,"'Tis highly necessary this,"
3431,BOOK IV.,Or two to one your aim you'll miss.
3432,BOOK IV.,
3433,BOOK IV.,"Like gunpowder, the thick-skull'd elf"
3434,BOOK IV.,"Took fire, and up he blew himself:"
3435,BOOK IV.,"Then fitting to his bow the string,"
3436,BOOK IV.,"He swore, by Jove, he'd do the thing."
3437,BOOK IV.,His trusty bow was made of horn
3438,BOOK IV.,An old ram goat for years had worn.
3439,BOOK IV.,"This goat by Pandarus was shot,"
3440,BOOK IV.,And left upon the cliffs to rot:
3441,BOOK IV.,"The curling horns, that spread asunder"
3442,BOOK IV.,"Two tailors' yards, became his plunder;"
3443,BOOK IV.,"Which he took care to smooth, and so"
3444,BOOK IV.,Produc'd a very handsome bow:
3445,BOOK IV.,"The blacksmith fil'd a curious joint,"
3446,BOOK IV.,And Deard with tinsel tipp'd each point.
3447,BOOK IV.,"This bow of bows, without being seen"
3448,BOOK IV.,"By any but his countrymen,"
3449,BOOK IV.,"He bent; and, that he might be safe,"
3450,BOOK IV.,Took care to hide his better half
3451,BOOK IV.,Behind the potlids of his band;
3452,BOOK IV.,For those he always could command.
3453,BOOK IV.,"Before he aim'd, he squatted low"
3454,BOOK IV.,To fit an arrow to his bow;
3455,BOOK IV.,"One from a hundred out he picks,"
3456,BOOK IV.,To send the cuckold over Styx
3457,BOOK IV.,"(Sharp was the point of this same arrow,"
3458,BOOK IV.,Design'd to reach the Spartan's marrow);
3459,BOOK IV.,Then to the god of day-light vows
3460,BOOK IV.,To give a dozen bulls and cows.
3461,BOOK IV.,"Now hard he strains, with wondrous strength,"
3462,BOOK IV.,And draws the arrow all its length:
3463,BOOK IV.,"Swift through the air the weapon hies,"
3464,BOOK IV.,Whilst the string rattles as it flies.
3465,BOOK IV.,"Had then Atrides been forgot,"
3466,BOOK IV.,He certainly had gone to pot:
3467,BOOK IV.,"But Pallas, for his life afraid,"
3468,BOOK IV.,"In pudding-time came to his aid,"
3469,BOOK IV.,"And turn'd aside the furious dart,"
3470,BOOK IV.,"That was intended for his heart,"
3471,BOOK IV.,Into a more ignoble part.
3472,BOOK IV.,"So careful mothers, when they please,"
3473,BOOK IV.,Their children guard from lice and fleas.
3474,BOOK IV.,"The first emotion that he felt,"
3475,BOOK IV.,Was a great thump upon his belt:
3476,BOOK IV.,"For there the arrow, Pallas knew,"
3477,BOOK IV.,Could only pierce a little through.
3478,BOOK IV.,It did so; and the skin it rais'd:
3479,BOOK IV.,The blood gush'd out: which so amaz'd
3480,BOOK IV.,"The cuckold, that he was half craz'd:"
3481,BOOK IV.,He felt within himself strange twitches;
3482,BOOK IV.,'Twas thought by most he spoil'd his breeches.
3483,BOOK IV.,As when you seek for stuff to grace
3484,BOOK IV.,"Some fine court lady's neck and face,"
3485,BOOK IV.,All o'er her muddy skin you spread
3486,BOOK IV.,"A load of paint, both white and red,"
3487,BOOK IV.,"The diff'ring colours, sure enough,"
3488,BOOK IV.,"Must help to set each other off,"
3489,BOOK IV.,Spite of the hue that glares within
3490,BOOK IV.,"The filthy, muddy, greasy skin:"
3491,BOOK IV.,"Just so Atrides' blood you'd spy,"
3492,BOOK IV.,As it ran down his dirty thigh;
3493,BOOK IV.,"His knee, and leg, and ancle pass'd,"
3494,BOOK IV.,And reach'd his sweaty foot at last.
3495,BOOK IV.,"At this most dreadful, rueful sight,"
3496,BOOK IV.,"Atrides' hair stood bolt upright,"
3497,BOOK IV.,"And lifted, all the Grecians said,"
3498,BOOK IV.,His hat six inches from his head.
3499,BOOK IV.,Nor less the honest cuckold quak'd;
3500,BOOK IV.,His heart as well as belly ach'd;
3501,BOOK IV.,"Till looking at the place that bled,"
3502,BOOK IV.,He plainly saw the arrow's head
3503,BOOK IV.,Stopp'd by his greasy belt: he then
3504,BOOK IV.,Boldly took heart of grace again.
3505,BOOK IV.,"But the great chief, who thought the arrow"
3506,BOOK IV.,"Had reach'd his brother's guts or marrow,"
3507,BOOK IV.,"With bitter sobbing heav'd his chest,"
3508,BOOK IV.,And thus his heavy grief express'd;
3509,BOOK IV.,"Whilst all the Grecians, far and near,"
3510,BOOK IV.,"Did nought but threaten, curse, and swear:"
3511,BOOK IV.,
3512,BOOK IV.,My dearest bro. for this did I
3513,BOOK IV.,Desire a truce? Zounds! I could cry:
3514,BOOK IV.,It proves a fatal truce to thee;
3515,BOOK IV.,"Nay, fatal both to thee and me."
3516,BOOK IV.,Thou fought'st till all the fray did cease:
3517,BOOK IV.,"Now to be slain, in time of peace,"
3518,BOOK IV.,Is dev'lish hard:--with rueful phiz
3519,BOOK IV.,He added? By my soul it is!
3520,BOOK IV.,"Those scoundrel Trojans all combine,"
3521,BOOK IV.,In hopes to ruin thee and thine;
3522,BOOK IV.,"They've stole thy goods, and kiss'd thy wife,"
3523,BOOK IV.,And now they want to take thy life:
3524,BOOK IV.,"With perjuries the rogues are cramm'd,"
3525,BOOK IV.,For which they will be double damn'd.
3526,BOOK IV.,"Now we good Grecians, when it meet is"
3527,BOOK IV.,"To make with scoundrel neighbours treaties,"
3528,BOOK IV.,As Britons (but the Lord knows how)
3529,BOOK IV.,"With roguish Frenchmen often do,"
3530,BOOK IV.,We're strict and honest to our word;
3531,BOOK IV.,So should each man that wears a sword.
3532,BOOK IV.,What pity 'tis that rogues so base
3533,BOOK IV.,Should thus bamboozle Jove's own race!
3534,BOOK IV.,"But let it be thy comfort, brother,"
3535,BOOK IV.,"And with it thy resentment smother,"
3536,BOOK IV.,That Jove in flames such rogues will burnish;
3537,BOOK IV.,Already he begins to furnish
3538,BOOK IV.,"With red-hot balls his mutton fist,"
3539,BOOK IV.,To singe and pepper whom he list.
3540,BOOK IV.,"Be sure, that when he once begins,"
3541,BOOK IV.,"He'll smoke these scoundrels for their sins,"
3542,BOOK IV.,Make Priam's house of scurvy peers
3543,BOOK IV.,Come tumbling down about their ears.
3544,BOOK IV.,"These Trojans, if they do not mend on't,"
3545,BOOK IV.,"Will all be hang'd at least, depend on't:"
3546,BOOK IV.,"For thee, my brother, who deserv'd"
3547,BOOK IV.,"Much better fate than be so serv'd,"
3548,BOOK IV.,"I trust thou wilt not die so sudden,"
3549,BOOK IV.,But still eat many a pound of pudding.
3550,BOOK IV.,"If aught but good should hap to thee,"
3551,BOOK IV.,God knows what must become of me.
3552,BOOK IV.,"When thou art gone, thy men of might"
3553,BOOK IV.,"Will run, but rot me if they'll fight."
3554,BOOK IV.,"When once they've lost thy brave example,"
3555,BOOK IV.,They'll let the Trojan rascals trample
3556,BOOK IV.,Their very guts out ere they'll budge;
3557,BOOK IV.,"They will, as sure as God's my judge."
3558,BOOK IV.,"Shall Helen then with Paris stay,"
3559,BOOK IV.,Whilst thy poor bones consume away;
3560,BOOK IV.,"And some sad dog, thy recent tomb,"
3561,BOOK IV.,Lug out his ware and piss upon?
3562,BOOK IV.,"Adding, that all Atrides got,"
3563,BOOK IV.,Was to come here to lie and rot;
3564,BOOK IV.,"Nor durst his bullying brother stay,"
3565,BOOK IV.,But very stoutly ran away.
3566,BOOK IV.,"Before this scandal on me peep,"
3567,BOOK IV.,May I be buried nine yards deep!
3568,BOOK IV.,
3569,BOOK IV.,"He spoke; and sighing rubs his eyes,"
3570,BOOK IV.,When Menelaus thus replies:
3571,BOOK IV.,"Thy tears, my hero, prithee keep,"
3572,BOOK IV.,Lest they should make our soldiers weep:
3573,BOOK IV.,"'Tis but, at worst, a harmless scratch;"
3574,BOOK IV.,I'll put upon't a lady's patch:
3575,BOOK IV.,"Or, if you think 'twill mend you faster,"
3576,BOOK IV.,I'll send for Borton's[5] sticking-plaster.
3577,BOOK IV.,"But if a surgeon's help is meet,"
3578,BOOK IV.,Dispatch a messenger to th' Fleet;
3579,BOOK IV.,"There is a man, who well can do"
3580,BOOK IV.,"For scratches, burns, and poxes too."
3581,BOOK IV.,
3582,BOOK IV.,"The brother king, with gracious look,"
3583,BOOK IV.,"Once more resum'd the thread, and spoke"
3584,BOOK IV.,
3585,BOOK IV.,"May all the gods thy life defend,"
3586,BOOK IV.,And all thy wounds and scratches mend!
3587,BOOK IV.,"Talthybius, fly, Machaon bid"
3588,BOOK IV.,Run faster than he ever did;
3589,BOOK IV.,"Let him await us in our tents,"
3590,BOOK IV.,And bring his box of instruments;
3591,BOOK IV.,"My brother's wounded with a dart,"
3592,BOOK IV.,"For aught I know, in mortal part"
3593,BOOK IV.,
3594,BOOK IV.,"With such a haste Talthybius run,"
3595,BOOK IV.,He knock'd two common troopers down;
3596,BOOK IV.,"Then search'd through every file and rank,"
3597,BOOK IV.,And found the surgeon in the flank.
3598,BOOK IV.,
3599,BOOK IV.,"The king, Machaon, wants your help;"
3600,BOOK IV.,"You must not march, but run, you whelp;"
3601,BOOK IV.,"And, with your box of instruments,"
3602,BOOK IV.,Attend the brothers in their tents:
3603,BOOK IV.,"Make speed, the best leg foremost put;"
3604,BOOK IV.,One brother's wounded in the gut;
3605,BOOK IV.,"And for the other, 'tis not clear"
3606,BOOK IV.,But he has burst his guts for fear.
3607,BOOK IV.,
3608,BOOK IV.,"The surgeon was a soldier good,"
3609,BOOK IV.,And in his regimentals stood.
3610,BOOK IV.,"Soon as he heard of what had pass'd,"
3611,BOOK IV.,No surgeon ever ran so fast.
3612,BOOK IV.,"Talthybius, who his speed did view,"
3613,BOOK IV.,Swears to this day he thought he flew.
3614,BOOK IV.,"Away he hied, with double speed,"
3615,BOOK IV.,To help the king in time of need
3616,BOOK IV.,"(A double motive surgeons brings,"
3617,BOOK IV.,When they attend the wounds of kings;
3618,BOOK IV.,"It happens oft, as I have heard,"
3619,BOOK IV.,"Besides their pay, they get preferr'd)."
3620,BOOK IV.,"Away puff'd Chiron on full drive,"
3621,BOOK IV.,In hopes to see the king alive.
3622,BOOK IV.,"Standing he found the man he sought,"
3623,BOOK IV.,And cleaner than at first was thought.
3624,BOOK IV.,"His comrades look'd a little blue,"
3625,BOOK IV.,And so perhaps might I or you.
3626,BOOK IV.,"He pluck'd the arrow with such speed,"
3627,BOOK IV.,Close to the head he broke the reed;
3628,BOOK IV.,"On which he for the buckles felt,"
3629,BOOK IV.,And loos'd at once both head and belt:
3630,BOOK IV.,"When kneeling down upon the ground,"
3631,BOOK IV.,Like Edward's queen he suck'd the wound;
3632,BOOK IV.,"Then to the place, to give it ease,"
3633,BOOK IV.,Apply'd a salve of pitch and grease.
3634,BOOK IV.,
3635,BOOK IV.,"But, while the surgeon was employ'd,"
3636,BOOK IV.,The Grecians sorely were annoy'd
3637,BOOK IV.,"By Trojan boys that flew about,"
3638,BOOK IV.,Resolv'd just then to box it out;
3639,BOOK IV.,"Roaring they came like drunken sailors,"
3640,BOOK IV.,Or idle combination tailors.
3641,BOOK IV.,The king durst hardly go or stay;
3642,BOOK IV.,But yet he scorn'd to run away:
3643,BOOK IV.,Though peace might make his head appear
3644,BOOK IV.,"A little thick, in war 'twas clear."
3645,BOOK IV.,"Though his own coach was by his side,"
3646,BOOK IV.,"Yet, like a man, he scorn'd to ride,"
3647,BOOK IV.,"Lest they should think him touch'd with pride,"
3648,BOOK IV.,"But ran on foot through all the host,"
3649,BOOK IV.,As nimbly as a penny post:
3650,BOOK IV.,
3651,BOOK IV.,"And cries, Attend, each mother's son!"
3652,BOOK IV.,This battle must be lost or won.
3653,BOOK IV.,"Remember now your ancient glory,"
3654,BOOK IV.,What broken heads there are in story
3655,BOOK IV.,Related of your fathers stout;
3656,BOOK IV.,And you yourselves are talk'd about:
3657,BOOK IV.,"A Trojan fighting one of you,"
3658,BOOK IV.,Has odds against him three to two:
3659,BOOK IV.,"The rascals rotten are as melons,"
3660,BOOK IV.,And full of guilt as Newgate felons.
3661,BOOK IV.,"We'll have 'em all in chains and cuffs,"
3662,BOOK IV.,But till that time let's work their buffs.
3663,BOOK IV.,This speech was made for men of mettle;
3664,BOOK IV.,He next the cowards strives to settle:
3665,BOOK IV.,
3666,BOOK IV.,"O shame to all your former trades,"
3667,BOOK IV.,The ridicule of oyster jades!
3668,BOOK IV.,Do you intend to stand and see
3669,BOOK IV.,Your lighters flaming in the sea?
3670,BOOK IV.,"A special time to stare and quake,"
3671,BOOK IV.,When more than all ye have's at stake!
3672,BOOK IV.,"Like stags, who, whilst they stand at bay,"
3673,BOOK IV.,Dare neither fight nor run away;
3674,BOOK IV.,Perhaps you think it worth the while
3675,BOOK IV.,"For Jove to fight, and save you toil:"
3676,BOOK IV.,"But you will find, without a jest,"
3677,BOOK IV.,He safest stands who boxes best.
3678,BOOK IV.,
3679,BOOK IV.,"This said, like Brentford's mighty king"
3680,BOOK IV.,"He march'd, and strutted round the ring."
3681,BOOK IV.,"Th' old Cretan gave him great content,"
3682,BOOK IV.,To see him head his regiment;
3683,BOOK IV.,And to observe how void of fear
3684,BOOK IV.,The bold Merion form'd the rear.
3685,BOOK IV.,"The serjeant-majors, in their places,"
3686,BOOK IV.,"Advanc'd, with grim determin'd faces."
3687,BOOK IV.,"The king, elated much with joy,"
3688,BOOK IV.,Clasp'd in his arms the fine old boy:
3689,BOOK IV.,O Idomen! what thanks we owe
3690,BOOK IV.,To men of such-like mould as you!
3691,BOOK IV.,Thy worth by far exceeds belief:
3692,BOOK IV.,"When Jove from war shall give relief,"
3693,BOOK IV.,Be thine the foremost cut o' th' beef:
3694,BOOK IV.,"And when our pots of ale we quaff,"
3695,BOOK IV.,"Mix'd with small beer the better half,"
3696,BOOK IV.,"Thy share, depend, shall never fail"
3697,BOOK IV.,"To be a double pot, all ale."
3698,BOOK IV.,
3699,BOOK IV.,The Cretan had not learn'd to dance;
3700,BOOK IV.,Had ne'er from Dover skipp'd to France:
3701,BOOK IV.,"For though 'tis plain he meant no evil,"
3702,BOOK IV.,You'll say his answer was not civil:
3703,BOOK IV.,
3704,BOOK IV.,There needs no words to raise my courage
3705,BOOK IV.,So save your wind to cool your porridge:
3706,BOOK IV.,"I'll venture boldly though to say,"
3707,BOOK IV.,I'll act what you command this day:
3708,BOOK IV.,"Let but the trumpets sound to battle,"
3709,BOOK IV.,I'll make the Trojans' doublets rattle.
3710,BOOK IV.,
3711,BOOK IV.,"The king was rather pleas'd than vex'd,"
3712,BOOK IV.,So travell'd onward to the next.
3713,BOOK IV.,Ajax he found among his blues;
3714,BOOK IV.,"Ajax, says he, my boy, what news?"
3715,BOOK IV.,"Now this he said, because 'twas hard"
3716,BOOK IV.,To have for all a speech prepar'd:
3717,BOOK IV.,But yet he gladly feasts his eyes
3718,BOOK IV.,With his new mode of exercise:
3719,BOOK IV.,He found 'twas Prussian every inch;
3720,BOOK IV.,Of mighty service at a pinch;
3721,BOOK IV.,"He saw him close his files, then double"
3722,BOOK IV.,"(A trick, new learn'd, the foe to bubble);"
3723,BOOK IV.,"Next wheel'd to right and left about,"
3724,BOOK IV.,And made 'em face both in and out;
3725,BOOK IV.,"Then turn upon the centre quick,"
3726,BOOK IV.,As easy as a juggler's trick;
3727,BOOK IV.,Whence soon they form'd into a square;
3728,BOOK IV.,Then back again just as they were.
3729,BOOK IV.,"By this parade, Atrides knew"
3730,BOOK IV.,That phalanx might be trusted to.
3731,BOOK IV.,"Now, all this while his plotting head"
3732,BOOK IV.,"Had conn'd a speech, and thus he said:"
3733,BOOK IV.,
3734,BOOK IV.,"To say I'm pleas'd, O gallant knight!"
3735,BOOK IV.,Is barely doing what is right:
3736,BOOK IV.,"Thy soldiers well may heroes be,"
3737,BOOK IV.,When they such bright examples see.
3738,BOOK IV.,
3739,BOOK IV.,Would Jove but to the rest impart
3740,BOOK IV.,"A piece of thy undaunted heart,"
3741,BOOK IV.,"Trojans would helter-skelter run,"
3742,BOOK IV.,And their old walls come tumbling down.
3743,BOOK IV.,
3744,BOOK IV.,"The next he found was ancient Nestor,"
3745,BOOK IV.,"Who, spite of age, was still a jester:"
3746,BOOK IV.,"For military art renown'd,"
3747,BOOK IV.,As Bland's his knowledge was profound
3748,BOOK IV.,"Besides, when he thought fit, could speak"
3749,BOOK IV.,In any language--best in Greek.
3750,BOOK IV.,"The king espy'd his men in ranks,"
3751,BOOK IV.,And flew to give th' old firelock thanks;
3752,BOOK IV.,"Observ'd how just he plac'd his forces,"
3753,BOOK IV.,His footmen and his line of horses.
3754,BOOK IV.,"The foot[6] were wisely rang'd in front,"
3755,BOOK IV.,That they the first might bear the brunt.
3756,BOOK IV.,
3757,BOOK IV.,"[Illustration: Book IV, page 198."
3758,BOOK IV.,"The king espied his men in ranks,"
3759,BOOK IV.,And flew to give th' old firelock thanks;
3760,BOOK IV.,"Observ'd how just he plac'd his forces,"
3761,BOOK IV.,His footmen and his line of horses.
3762,BOOK IV.,"The foot were wisely rang'd in front,"
3763,BOOK IV.,That they the first might bear the brunt.]
3764,BOOK IV.,
3765,BOOK IV.,"The horse along the flanks he drew,"
3766,BOOK IV.,To keep 'em ready to pursue.
3767,BOOK IV.,"The rear made up of mod'rate men,"
3768,BOOK IV.,"Half hearts of cock, half hearts of hen."
3769,BOOK IV.,The very riff-raff rogues they venture
3770,BOOK IV.,To squeeze together in the centre.
3771,BOOK IV.,"Thus fix'd, they kept a sharp look-out,"
3772,BOOK IV.,And ready stood to buckle to't.
3773,BOOK IV.,A man with half an eye could see
3774,BOOK IV.,"A rare old Grecian this must be,"
3775,BOOK IV.,Who in so small a space could keep
3776,BOOK IV.,His knaves from jumbling in a heap;
3777,BOOK IV.,Then with a phiz as wise as grave
3778,BOOK IV.,The following advice he gave:
3779,BOOK IV.,
3780,BOOK IV.,"If you in battle chance to fall,"
3781,BOOK IV.,"Don't stay to rise, for that spoils all;"
3782,BOOK IV.,"To rise as some men do, I mean,"
3783,BOOK IV.,"Burn foremost, then your back is seen;"
3784,BOOK IV.,"But jump directly bolt upright,"
3785,BOOK IV.,Ready prepar'd to run or fight.
3786,BOOK IV.,"Advice like this our fathers took,"
3787,BOOK IV.,And drove the world along like smoke.
3788,BOOK IV.,
3789,BOOK IV.,"Thus spoke the queer old Grecian chief,"
3790,BOOK IV.,And pleas'd the king beyond belief;
3791,BOOK IV.,"Who cry'd, 'Tis cursed hard that age"
3792,BOOK IV.,Should drive such leaders off the stage:
3793,BOOK IV.,"Whilst other bruisers die forgot,"
3794,BOOK IV.,Eternal youth should be thy lot.
3795,BOOK IV.,
3796,BOOK IV.,"When Nestor shook his hoary locks,"
3797,BOOK IV.,"And thus replies: Age, with a pox!"
3798,BOOK IV.,"Will come apace: could I, forsooth,"
3799,BOOK IV.,"Recall the strength I had in youth,"
3800,BOOK IV.,"When Ereuthalion I did thwack,"
3801,BOOK IV.,Be sure I would that strength call back;
3802,BOOK IV.,But dear experience can't be gotten
3803,BOOK IV.,Till we're with tricks of youth half rotten:
3804,BOOK IV.,"The young are fittest for the field,"
3805,BOOK IV.,But to the old in council yield.
3806,BOOK IV.,"Though now my fighting bears no price,"
3807,BOOK IV.,Yet I can give you rare advice.
3808,BOOK IV.,"Fight you and scuffle whilst you're young,"
3809,BOOK IV.,My vigour centres in my tongue:
3810,BOOK IV.,"I would do more to show my love,"
3811,BOOK IV.,But can no other weapon move.
3812,BOOK IV.,With joy great Agamemnon heard
3813,BOOK IV.,"This doughty knight o' th' grizzle beard,"
3814,BOOK IV.,
3815,BOOK IV.,"He left him then, because he had"
3816,BOOK IV.,"No time to spare, things look'd but bad:"
3817,BOOK IV.,"When, lo! he found Menestheus"
3818,BOOK IV.,In a most lamentable fuss.
3819,BOOK IV.,"His potlid he could not explore,"
3820,BOOK IV.,Because 'twas hid behind the door:
3821,BOOK IV.,"Searching about his tent all round him,"
3822,BOOK IV.,The gen'ral left him where he found him.
3823,BOOK IV.,
3824,BOOK IV.,Next spy'd Ulysses at his stand;
3825,BOOK IV.,Th' old buffs were under his command:
3826,BOOK IV.,"Idle they lay at distance far,"
3827,BOOK IV.,Nor knew a word about the war:
3828,BOOK IV.,"Atrides saw them playing pranks,"
3829,BOOK IV.,And all disorder'd in their ranks;
3830,BOOK IV.,Which made him in a mighty passion
3831,BOOK IV.,The poor Ulysses fall slap dash on:
3832,BOOK IV.,
3833,BOOK IV.,"I thought you, Mr. Slight-of-Hand,"
3834,BOOK IV.,Had known much better than to stand
3835,BOOK IV.,"Picking your fingers, whilst the rest"
3836,BOOK IV.,"Are forc'd to box their very best,"
3837,BOOK IV.,And make a marvellous resistance
3838,BOOK IV.,To keep these Trojan whelps at distance:
3839,BOOK IV.,"In time of peace you're much respected,"
3840,BOOK IV.,And never at our feasts neglected;
3841,BOOK IV.,"You're first i' th' list when I invite,"
3842,BOOK IV.,And therefore should be first in fight.
3843,BOOK IV.,
3844,BOOK IV.,"The sage Ulysses, with a blush,"
3845,BOOK IV.,"Returns for answer, Hush, hush, hush:"
3846,BOOK IV.,"If you speak loud, the Trojans hear;"
3847,BOOK IV.,"Not that we care, what need we fear?"
3848,BOOK IV.,But I'm persuaded you'll ere long
3849,BOOK IV.,Wish you had kept that noisy tongue
3850,BOOK IV.,"Betwixt your teeth, nor let it pass"
3851,BOOK IV.,To tell us all you're half an ass;
3852,BOOK IV.,"Why, can't you see we're ready booted,"
3853,BOOK IV.,And I've just got my jacket clouted?
3854,BOOK IV.,Without your keeping such a coil.
3855,BOOK IV.,Ten minutes fits us for our broil;
3856,BOOK IV.,"Give you the word, and we'll obey,"
3857,BOOK IV.,At quarter-staff or cudgel play;
3858,BOOK IV.,"When we begin, perhaps I'll do"
3859,BOOK IV.,Such wonders as may frighten you.
3860,BOOK IV.,
3861,BOOK IV.,"Well said, Ulysses! cries the king"
3862,BOOK IV.,(A little touch'd though with the sting
3863,BOOK IV.,Of this rum speech); I only fear'd
3864,BOOK IV.,To catch my warrior off his guard;
3865,BOOK IV.,"But am rejoic'd to find thee steady,"
3866,BOOK IV.,For broils and wenching always ready.
3867,BOOK IV.,
3868,BOOK IV.,"He said, and pass'd to Diomede,"
3869,BOOK IV.,And caught him fast asleep in bed.
3870,BOOK IV.,"Zoons! quoth the king, I thought Tydides,"
3871,BOOK IV.,"The man in whom my greatest pride is,"
3872,BOOK IV.,"Might absent been perhaps a-whoring,"
3873,BOOK IV.,But little dreamt to catch him snoring:
3874,BOOK IV.,Dost thou not hear the Trojans rattle?
3875,BOOK IV.,Already they've begun the battle.
3876,BOOK IV.,"Not so thy father--none could doubt him,"
3877,BOOK IV.,He long ere this had laid about him;
3878,BOOK IV.,"Had gi'n the Trojans such a drubbing,"
3879,BOOK IV.,As would have say'd a twelvemonth's scrubbing:
3880,BOOK IV.,"'Tis known he was a lad of wax,"
3881,BOOK IV.,"Let <i>bellum</i> be the word, <i>aut pax</i>."
3882,BOOK IV.,"He was, indeed, of stature small,"
3883,BOOK IV.,But then in valour he was tall.
3884,BOOK IV.,"I saw him once, 'twas when he stray'd"
3885,BOOK IV.,To Polynice's house for aid;
3886,BOOK IV.,"Troopers he begg'd, and straight we gave 'em;"
3887,BOOK IV.,But Jove sent word he should not have 'em:
3888,BOOK IV.,"With long-tail'd comets made such rout,"
3889,BOOK IV.,That we e'en let him go without.
3890,BOOK IV.,"But after that, I know it fact,"
3891,BOOK IV.,He fifty blust'ring bullies thwack'd:
3892,BOOK IV.,"Nay, hold, I fib, 'twas forty-nine;"
3893,BOOK IV.,"For one he sav'd, a friend of mine,"
3894,BOOK IV.,"To witness that the tale was true,"
3895,BOOK IV.,Else 'twould have been believ'd by few.
3896,BOOK IV.,"Though two bold bruisers led them on,"
3897,BOOK IV.,"Meon and sturdy Lycophon,"
3898,BOOK IV.,He trimm'd their jackets ev'ry one.
3899,BOOK IV.,"But I must tell you in this case,"
3900,BOOK IV.,"And tell you flatly to your face,"
3901,BOOK IV.,"Since our affairs so ill you handle,"
3902,BOOK IV.,You're hardly fit to hold his candle.
3903,BOOK IV.,
3904,BOOK IV.,"With rage and grief Tydides stung,"
3905,BOOK IV.,"Scratch'd his rump raw, yet held his tongue;"
3906,BOOK IV.,Provok'd by this abusive knight
3907,BOOK IV.,To scratch the place that did not bite.
3908,BOOK IV.,Not so the son of Capaneus;
3909,BOOK IV.,He soon began to play the deuce:
3910,BOOK IV.,
3911,BOOK IV.,"Good Mr. Chief, if you would try"
3912,BOOK IV.,"To speak the truth, you would not lye;"
3913,BOOK IV.,"Like other mortals though we rest,"
3914,BOOK IV.,We'll box it with the very best.
3915,BOOK IV.,"Though we, I say, and I'm no puffer,"
3916,BOOK IV.,By the comparison can't suffer;
3917,BOOK IV.,"Yet I insist it is not fair,"
3918,BOOK IV.,The sons with fathers to compare.
3919,BOOK IV.,"But pray, Sir, venture to be just;"
3920,BOOK IV.,"And, when you think, I'm sure you must,"
3921,BOOK IV.,"Spite of your wrath, be forc'd to say"
3922,BOOK IV.,We know to fight as well as they:
3923,BOOK IV.,"And give me leave, Sir, to assure ye,"
3924,BOOK IV.,"Our arm's as strong, though less our fury."
3925,BOOK IV.,Against proud Thebes our father fail'd;
3926,BOOK IV.,With half their force the sons prevail'd:
3927,BOOK IV.,"Our fathers suffer'd in their shoes,"
3928,BOOK IV.,And died like damn'd blaspheming Jews;
3929,BOOK IV.,"But Jupiter himself stood by us,"
3930,BOOK IV.,Because he found the sons more pious.
3931,BOOK IV.,"Therefore, in spite of all your airs,"
3932,BOOK IV.,Our broils have made more noise than theirs.
3933,BOOK IV.,
3934,BOOK IV.,"To him Tydides: Cease, my 'squire,"
3935,BOOK IV.,To wrangle thus; and curb thy fire.
3936,BOOK IV.,Thy betters know the anxious chief
3937,BOOK IV.,Is almost starv'd for want of beef;
3938,BOOK IV.,"No wonder then that he's so crusty,"
3939,BOOK IV.,'Twould make or you or me ride resty:
3940,BOOK IV.,"But we will fight if he leads on,"
3941,BOOK IV.,"And second him, my boy, ding dong."
3942,BOOK IV.,"He spoke, and took a flying jump,"
3943,BOOK IV.,And on the ground his breech came thump;
3944,BOOK IV.,"But up he sprang, and with a rattle,"
3945,BOOK IV.,His 'squire and he rush'd forth to battle;
3946,BOOK IV.,"And, as they hurried to begin,"
3947,BOOK IV.,Their buff-coats made a dreadful din:
3948,BOOK IV.,"As when the scavengers you meet,"
3949,BOOK IV.,"Prepar'd with brooms to scour the street,"
3950,BOOK IV.,"With gentle pace at first they sweep,"
3951,BOOK IV.,And a slow lazy motion keep.
3952,BOOK IV.,'Till wave on wave creates a flood
3953,BOOK IV.,Of cabbage leaves and kennel mud;
3954,BOOK IV.,"But when the shovel plays its part,"
3955,BOOK IV.,"It mounts aloft, and fills the cart:"
3956,BOOK IV.,"So the Greek ragged bands move on,"
3957,BOOK IV.,The hindmost drive the front along;
3958,BOOK IV.,"No sound through all the ranks you hear,"
3959,BOOK IV.,Except the general chance to swear:
3960,BOOK IV.,"March and be d--d, the chief would say,"
3961,BOOK IV.,And silent all the troops obey.
3962,BOOK IV.,"Not so the Trojans' empty skulls,"
3963,BOOK IV.,Their noise exceeded Basan's bulls;
3964,BOOK IV.,"So many diff'rent shires, when squabbling"
3965,BOOK IV.,"Like Welch and Scotch, must make rare gabbling."
3966,BOOK IV.,To it they fall: a Heathen sprite
3967,BOOK IV.,Heartens each army to the fight.
3968,BOOK IV.,"Mars backs the Trojans, Pallas seeks"
3969,BOOK IV.,To help her dear-beloved Greeks;
3970,BOOK IV.,"Discord and Terror rage in fight,"
3971,BOOK IV.,Attended by that spectre Flight.
3972,BOOK IV.,"Discord, the curse of Christian nations,"
3973,BOOK IV.,But most the bane of corporations;
3974,BOOK IV.,"When born, though smaller than a fly,"
3975,BOOK IV.,In half an hour she'll grow so high
3976,BOOK IV.,Her head will almost touch the sky.
3977,BOOK IV.,Too often at a lord mayor's feast
3978,BOOK IV.,"She comes, a most unwelcome guest;"
3979,BOOK IV.,Too often drags both great and small
3980,BOOK IV.,In heat of blood to Wranglers' Hall[7];
3981,BOOK IV.,"Where half their wealth is from 'em lugg'd,"
3982,BOOK IV.,Before they find themselves humbugg'd:
3983,BOOK IV.,Affliction brings both sides to think;
3984,BOOK IV.,So down they friendly sit and drink.
3985,BOOK IV.,Vex'd they're drawn in to be employers
3986,BOOK IV.,"Of thieves, solicitors, and lawyers,"
3987,BOOK IV.,
3988,BOOK IV.,"Now bloody blows by scores are struck,"
3989,BOOK IV.,Yet not a man was seen to duck:
3990,BOOK IV.,"A noise of shouts and grumbling spreads,"
3991,BOOK IV.,From luckless knaves with broken heads:
3992,BOOK IV.,With blood of noble captains wounded
3993,BOOK IV.,Ten million ants and grubs were drowned.
3994,BOOK IV.,"As from a brewer's sink, a torrent"
3995,BOOK IV.,"Comes with a most prodigious current,"
3996,BOOK IV.,And roaring with amazing force
3997,BOOK IV.,Bears down in its resistless course
3998,BOOK IV.,"Stale radishes, bruis'd mint, and fennel,"
3999,BOOK IV.,Nor stops till it has reach'd the kennel;
4000,BOOK IV.,"So these two crowds each other jostle,"
4001,BOOK IV.,And 'twixt 'em make a dreadful bustle.
4002,BOOK IV.,
4003,BOOK IV.,The bloody fray is first begun
4004,BOOK IV.,By chatt'ring Nestor's saucy son;
4005,BOOK IV.,"Echepolus by chance was nigh,"
4006,BOOK IV.,At whom he let his broomstick fly;
4007,BOOK IV.,"Upon the nob it hit him full,"
4008,BOOK IV.,"Spoil'd his best hat, and crack'd his skull."
4009,BOOK IV.,"Down on the ground he tumbled souse,"
4010,BOOK IV.,Like tiles from Whitfield's meeting-house;
4011,BOOK IV.,"Or like an ancient country steeple,"
4012,BOOK IV.,That tumbling frights both priest and people;
4013,BOOK IV.,"When Elpenor, a crack-brain'd fellow,"
4014,BOOK IV.,"Whose coat was red, and waistcoat yellow,"
4015,BOOK IV.,"A staring, gaping, hair-brain'd prig,"
4016,BOOK IV.,Attempts to steal his hat and wig:
4017,BOOK IV.,"But, as he ventur'd forth his hand"
4018,BOOK IV.,"To draw the plunder off the sand,"
4019,BOOK IV.,"Hugging himself at his rare luck,"
4020,BOOK IV.,Agenor's broomshaft reach'd his pluck:
4021,BOOK IV.,"His potlid left his side unguarded,"
4022,BOOK IV.,And so the puppy got rewarded:
4023,BOOK IV.,"He falls, and sprawls about in blood,"
4024,BOOK IV.,And fills his mouth with dirt and mud.
4025,BOOK IV.,
4026,BOOK IV.,Now Greeks and Trojans round him flock;
4027,BOOK IV.,And lend each other many a knock;
4028,BOOK IV.,"The sharpest weapon foremost put,"
4029,BOOK IV.,And strive to rip each others gut.
4030,BOOK IV.,"Simoisius, a lovely boy"
4031,BOOK IV.,As any you shall find in Troy:
4032,BOOK IV.,On Ida's side his mother bore
4033,BOOK IV.,"The bantling, near Simois' shore;"
4034,BOOK IV.,"And from that river, now so fam'd,"
4035,BOOK IV.,Her darling Simoisius nam'd:
4036,BOOK IV.,"Great Ajax took him for his mark,"
4037,BOOK IV.,And quickly chaunch'd the luckless spark.
4038,BOOK IV.,"For shame, you lubber! thus to catch"
4039,BOOK IV.,A harmless boy not half your match!
4040,BOOK IV.,"But honest Ajax ever thought,"
4041,BOOK IV.,"'Twas all the same, if he but fought:"
4042,BOOK IV.,"Let him but go, away he stalks,"
4043,BOOK IV.,And strikes at reeds as well as oaks.
4044,BOOK IV.,"Thus the unlucky younker fell,"
4045,BOOK IV.,"But how, he never yet could tell."
4046,BOOK IV.,"Like a tall tree, that Farmer Bates"
4047,BOOK IV.,"Cuts down to mend his rotten gates,"
4048,BOOK IV.,With a huge squash its branches all
4049,BOOK IV.,Get sorely rumpled by the fall;
4050,BOOK IV.,"So this poor boy, in tumbling down,"
4051,BOOK IV.,"Lost a good wig, and bruis'd his crown."
4052,BOOK IV.,
4053,BOOK IV.,At Ajax then Antiphus throws
4054,BOOK IV.,"His staff; but how, he hardly knows:"
4055,BOOK IV.,"In such a hurry are some widgeons,"
4056,BOOK IV.,They kill jack-daws instead of pigeons:
4057,BOOK IV.,Such a strange blund'ring fellow this is;
4058,BOOK IV.,"He lam'd the fav'rite of Ulysses,"
4059,BOOK IV.,Just as he stooping was to catch
4060,BOOK IV.,"Poor Simmey's potlid and his watch,"
4061,BOOK IV.,"Ulysses was confounded mad,"
4062,BOOK IV.,To see his fav'rite fare so bad:
4063,BOOK IV.,"He swore a little, that's the truth,"
4064,BOOK IV.,"Look'd mighty big, and froth'd at mouth;"
4065,BOOK IV.,"Then sudden from the ranks steps out,"
4066,BOOK IV.,Arm'd with a broomshaft firm and stout:
4067,BOOK IV.,"He makes a feint to fetch a stroke,"
4068,BOOK IV.,But first he turns with cautious look;
4069,BOOK IV.,"Then cries, Have at your whoring gullets;"
4070,BOOK IV.,I wish 'twas twenty ton of bullets.
4071,BOOK IV.,"Away the massy broomstick goes,"
4072,BOOK IV.,And carries dread to all the foes:
4073,BOOK IV.,"It reach'd a huge fat-gutted fellow,"
4074,BOOK IV.,For all the world like Punchinello:
4075,BOOK IV.,"He was old Priam's jolly son,"
4076,BOOK IV.,Too good a mark for sword or gun;
4077,BOOK IV.,"For, as a treble place he fill'd,"
4078,BOOK IV.,'Twas three to one he must be kill'd.
4079,BOOK IV.,"Down tumbled he, with such a thwack,"
4080,BOOK IV.,"He made, with his amazing back,"
4081,BOOK IV.,The earth just like a nutshell crack;
4082,BOOK IV.,"And shook the globe to th' centre so,"
4083,BOOK IV.,Old Pluto sent a sprite to know
4084,BOOK IV.,The reason why these sons of men
4085,BOOK IV.,Disturb'd him in his sooty den?
4086,BOOK IV.,"For, nodding on his red-hot throne,"
4087,BOOK IV.,They'd like to've brought him headlong down.
4088,BOOK IV.,
4089,BOOK IV.,"The Trojans look'd a little black,"
4090,BOOK IV.,And 'gan to show the Greeks their back;
4091,BOOK IV.,"E'en Hector's self, with sullen pace,"
4092,BOOK IV.,"Retreats, bum foremost, from his place:"
4093,BOOK IV.,"The rest all tumble helter-skelter,"
4094,BOOK IV.,And run just where they could for shelter;
4095,BOOK IV.,"Whilst the victorious Greeks press on,"
4096,BOOK IV.,And pick their pockets when they're down.
4097,BOOK IV.,
4098,BOOK IV.,"When Phœbus saw them run this pace,"
4099,BOOK IV.,He quick unmask'd his fiery face;
4100,BOOK IV.,"And hollo'ing from the Trojan wall,"
4101,BOOK IV.,"As loud as ever he could bawl,"
4102,BOOK IV.,"Cries, Halt, ye whelps! and strive to save"
4103,BOOK IV.,The little credit that you have:
4104,BOOK IV.,"Turn back, and make the Grecians feel"
4105,BOOK IV.,They are not made of brass or steel:
4106,BOOK IV.,"Achilles swears he'll fight no more,"
4107,BOOK IV.,"For Gen'ral Rogue, or Madam Whore;"
4108,BOOK IV.,"Then what the devil makes ye run,"
4109,BOOK IV.,Unless to get well drubb'd for fun?
4110,BOOK IV.,"What scurvy knave could thus amuse ye,"
4111,BOOK IV.,When scarce a single soul pursues ye?
4112,BOOK IV.,"Thus Phœbus, from the Trojan walls,"
4113,BOOK IV.,Their almost fainting hearts recalls:
4114,BOOK IV.,"Pallas hears all, and quickly starts up,"
4115,BOOK IV.,"To back the Greeks, and keep their hearts up."
4116,BOOK IV.,
4117,BOOK IV.,Diores next: the sun can't shine
4118,BOOK IV.,Upon a nobler than his line:
4119,BOOK IV.,"A lord he was, or earl, or duke,"
4120,BOOK IV.,"But which, I have not time to look;"
4121,BOOK IV.,Yet could not all his titles rare
4122,BOOK IV.,Defend him from the chance of war:
4123,BOOK IV.,"One Pirus threw a ragged stone,"
4124,BOOK IV.,Which sorely bruis'd his huckle-bone;
4125,BOOK IV.,"Depriv'd of power to make resistance,"
4126,BOOK IV.,He begs of all his peers assistance:
4127,BOOK IV.,"But, amongst all the valiant rout,"
4128,BOOK IV.,The de'il a man durst venture out;
4129,BOOK IV.,"'Cause they were wanted at a pinch,"
4130,BOOK IV.,No single soul would stir an inch.
4131,BOOK IV.,But whilst they wrangled which should go.
4132,BOOK IV.,My lord got pelted by the foe.
4133,BOOK IV.,"Had he been driving all before him,"
4134,BOOK IV.,"As surely as his mother bore him,"
4135,BOOK IV.,With eager haste these valiant souls
4136,BOOK IV.,Had back'd his good success in shoals:
4137,BOOK IV.,"But when they saw he could not stand,"
4138,BOOK IV.,Not one would lend a helping hand:
4139,BOOK IV.,And ever since this rule is held
4140,BOOK IV.,"'Mongst lords at court, though not i' th' field."
4141,BOOK IV.,
4142,BOOK IV.,Thoas beheld this Thracian chief
4143,BOOK IV.,Looking as fierce as roast bull-beef:
4144,BOOK IV.,"Thinks to himself, Young gentleman,"
4145,BOOK IV.,"A knock I'll fetch you, if I can."
4146,BOOK IV.,"He then a well aim'd broomstick throws,"
4147,BOOK IV.,"Which bruis'd his breast, and broke his nose:"
4148,BOOK IV.,"With such a rattle was it thrown,"
4149,BOOK IV.,It quickly brought the varlet down.
4150,BOOK IV.,"The Thracian huffs, their leader tumbled,"
4151,BOOK IV.,"In a great passion fought and grumbled,"
4152,BOOK IV.,"And kept up such a woeful racket,"
4153,BOOK IV.,That Thoas durst not steal his jacket;
4154,BOOK IV.,"And though he cast a-squint his eyes,"
4155,BOOK IV.,He trudg'd-away without his prize.
4156,BOOK IV.,
4157,BOOK IV.,"Thus fell two knights[8], the one of Thrace,"
4158,BOOK IV.,The other of some other place.
4159,BOOK IV.,"By fate of war, most strangely jumbled,"
4160,BOOK IV.,The conqu'rors with the conquer'd tumbled.
4161,BOOK IV.,"Had you been hung up by a thread,"
4162,BOOK IV.,"But fifty yards above their head,"
4163,BOOK IV.,Or plac'd behind a good strong wall
4164,BOOK IV.,"In which there was a little hole,"
4165,BOOK IV.,"The art of war you might have seen,"
4166,BOOK IV.,And wiser than before have been.
4167,BOOK IV.,Thus fought the troops with might and main;
4168,BOOK IV.,"Some fell, some stood to fight again."
4169,BOOK IV.,
4170,BOOK IV.,
4171,BOOK IV.,
4172,BOOK IV.,[1] <i>Whoring.</i> You see Juno keeps continually harping on that word: we
4173,BOOK IV.,"may judge from thence, she came in for small share of the labours of"
4174,BOOK IV.,"these whoring Trojans; but Venus did. There was one Anchises, a twice"
4175,BOOK IV.,"five-fingered Trojan, that (as old stories say) used to thrum her"
4176,BOOK IV.,jacket. Æneas was the produce of their leisure hours.
4177,BOOK IV.,
4178,BOOK IV.,"[2] <i>The same.</i> Here Juno overlooks a very severe rub of Jupiter's,"

4193,BOOK IV.,"what they used to their chariots: but, as he talks like an apothecary,"
4194,BOOK IV.,he gives himself what liberty he pleases.

4262,BOOK V.,"By poets call'd the martial maid,"
4263,BOOK V.,"Finding the fray would soon begin,"
4264,BOOK V.,Brought Diomed a dram of gin
4265,BOOK V.,"From her own case of heavenly liquor,"
4266,BOOK V.,"Which made his spirits flow much quicker,"
4267,BOOK V.,And swell'd his courage up so high
4268,BOOK V.,That all his comrades standing by
4269,BOOK V.,"Seem'd each no bigger than a rat,"
4270,BOOK V.,And he a swingeing tabby cat.
4271,BOOK V.,"That he might see the foe to handle,"
4272,BOOK V.,She in his beaver stuck a candle;
4273,BOOK V.,"Which made him cut a dreadful figure,"
4274,BOOK V.,And look at least twelve inches bigger:
4275,BOOK V.,Against his sandy pate this light
4276,BOOK V.,"Shin'd with a flame so fierce and bright,"
4277,BOOK V.,That by the people it was said
4278,BOOK V.,The dog-star was not half so red.
4279,BOOK V.,But the true case is this: the punk
4280,BOOK V.,"Had made the bullying scoundrel drunk,"
4281,BOOK V.,"Which fill'd the knave so full of ire,"
4282,BOOK V.,His sandy pate seem'd all on fire:
4283,BOOK V.,"Thus, with a face as red as scarlet,"
4284,BOOK V.,Upon the foe she drove the varlet.
4285,BOOK V.,"Two sons of Dares, hopeful lads,"
4286,BOOK V.,"Both fav'rites of their good old dad's,"
4287,BOOK V.,"An honest soul that lov'd a full can,"
4288,BOOK V.,"And was high-priest to limping Vulcan,"
4289,BOOK V.,The god of those ill-looking fellows
4290,BOOK V.,"That ply the forge, and blow the bellows;"
4291,BOOK V.,"A swarthy, sweaty race of men,"
4292,BOOK V.,"Call'd blacksmiths now, as well as then."
4293,BOOK V.,In Vulcan's church the good old wight
4294,BOOK V.,Smok'd a dry pipe from morn to night:
4295,BOOK V.,But as the boys had got no voice
4296,BOOK V.,"For singing psalms, he gave 'em choice,"
4297,BOOK V.,"Whether they'd go to th' wars a-fighting,"
4298,BOOK V.,Or stay at home and mind their writing.
4299,BOOK V.,"The first they chose, and now for fame"
4300,BOOK V.,Resolv'd at Tyd. to take their aim;
4301,BOOK V.,"When Phegeus, as their cart drew nigh;"
4302,BOOK V.,That instant let his broomstick fly;
4303,BOOK V.,But by good luck it only tipp'd
4304,BOOK V.,"The shoulder's point, and off it slipp'd"
4305,BOOK V.,Without much harm. Tydides now
4306,BOOK V.,"A swingeing knotty broomshaft threw,"
4307,BOOK V.,"Which gave his stomach such a thump,"
4308,BOOK V.,As fell'd the lad upon his rump.
4309,BOOK V.,"Ideus then was glad to run,"
4310,BOOK V.,"And leave, i' th' lurch his mother's son;"
4311,BOOK V.,"Though, had not limping vulcan taken"
4312,BOOK V.,"Some pains to save the stripling's bacon,"
4313,BOOK V.,"His running could not, I assure ye,"
4314,BOOK V.,Have say'd him from the Grecian's fury
4315,BOOK V.,"(For Tyd. could run, in time of need,"
4316,BOOK V.,What jockeys call a hellish speed);
4317,BOOK V.,But he so safe the younker put
4318,BOOK V.,"Within a cloud as black as soot,"
4319,BOOK V.,"The Greek might, ere he found his prize out,"
4320,BOOK V.,Have star'd a dozen pair of eyes out.
4321,BOOK V.,"Resolv'd no longer then to blunder,"
4322,BOOK V.,He seiz'd the cart for lawful plunder;
4323,BOOK V.,"And, all recov'ry to prevent,"
4324,BOOK V.,Dispatch'd the booty to his tent.
4325,BOOK V.,
4326,BOOK V.,"The Trojans in a dreadful fright,"
4327,BOOK V.,"Finding that one was vanish'd quite,"
4328,BOOK V.,"Swore that the dog had beat one brother,"
4329,BOOK V.,And for his breakfast eat the other.
4330,BOOK V.,
4331,BOOK V.,"Meanwhile Minerva, never sick"
4332,BOOK V.,Of playing Troy some slipp'ry trick
4333,BOOK V.,(For by the sequel you will find
4334,BOOK V.,Paris was ever in her mind);
4335,BOOK V.,"Although she was of wisdom goddess,"
4336,BOOK V.,"Yet, what to me most strange and odd is,"
4337,BOOK V.,"To be the wisest would not do,"
4338,BOOK V.,But she must be the prettiest too:
4339,BOOK V.,"This claim the sex assert, and still"
4340,BOOK V.,Wisdom gives way to woman's will.
4341,BOOK V.,"Her head was now of crotchets full,"
4342,BOOK V.,How to hum Mars's leaden skull.
4343,BOOK V.,"Quoth she, and grasp'd his clumsy fist,"
4344,BOOK V.,Certain to lead him where she list:
4345,BOOK V.,
4346,BOOK V.,"O thou that sett'st the world by th' ears,"
4347,BOOK V.,"And bring'st them into quaking fears,"
4348,BOOK V.,"Let all these hangdogs fight it out,"
4349,BOOK V.,And Jove decide the end o' th' rout!
4350,BOOK V.,"Let us march off, for if we stay"
4351,BOOK V.,He swears he'll drive us both away;
4352,BOOK V.,And you well know in what queer fashion
4353,BOOK V.,He uses people in his passion:
4354,BOOK V.,"And 'faith 'twould be a queerish jest,"
4355,BOOK V.,For us two mongrels to contest
4356,BOOK V.,"With him, who, at a single kick,"
4357,BOOK V.,Can send all heaven to Old Nick.
4358,BOOK V.,"These words took down the cut-throat's mettle,"
4359,BOOK V.,And made his boiling gizzard settle.
4360,BOOK V.,"On this they jointly ply'd their shanks,"
4361,BOOK V.,And quickly reach'd the river's banks;
4362,BOOK V.,"Where down they sat, to hear the moans"
4363,BOOK V.,Of batter'd skulls and broken bones.
4364,BOOK V.,
4365,BOOK V.,Meantime the furious Grecians follow
4366,BOOK V.,"The Trojans with a whoop and halloo,"
4367,BOOK V.,"Who having lost their bully, Mars,"
4368,BOOK V.,Got ev'ry man a kick o' th' arse:
4369,BOOK V.,"Nay, Fame, who all men's business knew,"
4370,BOOK V.,"Says, ev'ry Grecian drubb'd his two."
4371,BOOK V.,"First, Odius tumbled in the dirt;"
4372,BOOK V.,He blam'd that rogue Atrides for't:
4373,BOOK V.,"In his old cart he thought to fly,"
4374,BOOK V.,But the bluff Greek was got too nigh;
4375,BOOK V.,"His knotty broomstick reach'd his back,"
4376,BOOK V.,And lent him such a thund'ring thwack
4377,BOOK V.,"As made him with a vengeance feel,"
4378,BOOK V.,And fell'd him headlong o'er the wheel.
4379,BOOK V.,
4380,BOOK V.,"Phestus, old farmer Borus' son,"
4381,BOOK V.,"Saw it was time for him to run,"
4382,BOOK V.,But thought it the most prudent part
4383,BOOK V.,To carry off his horse and cart;
4384,BOOK V.,"So strove to mount, when in the nick"
4385,BOOK V.,Idomeneus sent his stick;
4386,BOOK V.,"With such a rattle did it come,"
4387,BOOK V.,It brought him squash upon his bum.
4388,BOOK V.,
4389,BOOK V.,"Scamandrius then, a huntsman good"
4390,BOOK V.,"As ever drove through plain or wood,"
4391,BOOK V.,Next tumbled down: Diana taught
4392,BOOK V.,This swain how snipes and hares are caught;
4393,BOOK V.,"How, in a scarcity of cats,"
4394,BOOK V.,"To clear folks' barns from mice and rats,"
4395,BOOK V.,"By setting traps, and that way rout 'em;"
4396,BOOK V.,Or with a cross-bow he could shoot 'em;
4397,BOOK V.,Yet at this crisis all his art
4398,BOOK V.,Doth not avail a single f--t;
4399,BOOK V.,"The cuckold[1] fetch'd him such a stroke,"
4400,BOOK V.,As half his ribs and back-bone broke.
4401,BOOK V.,"Down came Pilgarlick with a bang,"
4402,BOOK V.,And loud his copper pot-lid rang.
4403,BOOK V.,"Then Pherocles, a good mechanic,"
4404,BOOK V.,"Seiz'd with a Preston-pan-ish panic,"
4405,BOOK V.,"Ran stoutly; which Merion eyeing,"
4406,BOOK V.,With his rough broomstick shot him flying.
4407,BOOK V.,"For building huts, and boats, and lighters,"
4408,BOOK V.,The de'il a loon among these fighters
4409,BOOK V.,Could be compar'd to Pherocles:
4410,BOOK V.,He beat a thousand such as these.
4411,BOOK V.,"The boat he built, each plank and piece,"
4412,BOOK V.,That carried Paris o'er to Greece;
4413,BOOK V.,But little thought that he was doing
4414,BOOK V.,A job that ended in his ruin.
4415,BOOK V.,"The broomshaft bruis'd his hip or thigh,"
4416,BOOK V.,No matter which to you or I.
4417,BOOK V.,
4418,BOOK V.,"Antenor's by-blow next succeeds,"
4419,BOOK V.,And by a mighty mopstick bleeds:
4420,BOOK V.,"Though strange, Antenor's wife, 'tis known,"
4421,BOOK V.,Nurs'd this young bastard like her own.
4422,BOOK V.,"'Twas labour lost, for Meges soon"
4423,BOOK V.,With an old mopstick brought him down.
4424,BOOK V.,"Whiz through the air the weapon flew,"
4425,BOOK V.,And hit his jaws with aim so true
4426,BOOK V.,It made him bite his tongue in two.
4427,BOOK V.,
4428,BOOK V.,"Hypenor, who was far too good"
4429,BOOK V.,"To live among so vile a brood,"
4430,BOOK V.,"Was curate to Scamander's flood,"
4431,BOOK V.,Near which his house and garden stood;
4432,BOOK V.,"Where, by the help of gentle show'rs,"
4433,BOOK V.,He rais'd green peas and cauliflow'rs:
4434,BOOK V.,"Euripilus his shoulder struck,"
4435,BOOK V.,And lent him a confounded knock;
4436,BOOK V.,"Which glancing downward bruis'd his hand,"
4437,BOOK V.,And holy blood dropp'd o'er the land.
4438,BOOK V.,"The curate's pray'rs, though very good,"
4439,BOOK V.,Could not prevent his losing blood.
4440,BOOK V.,
4441,BOOK V.,Thus each man labour'd in his post;
4442,BOOK V.,But Diomed still rul'd the roast:
4443,BOOK V.,"Like Jack with lanthern, ev'ry where"
4444,BOOK V.,He skipp'd about; now here now there:
4445,BOOK V.,"If they won't fight, their steps he traces,"
4446,BOOK V.,"And kicks their bums, or scrats their faces:"
4447,BOOK V.,"Thus, when a hasty show'r comes down"
4448,BOOK V.,"Upon a sneaking taylor's crown,"
4449,BOOK V.,"The stream a mighty world annoys,"
4450,BOOK V.,And swarms of nits and lice destroys;
4451,BOOK V.,"Washes the lousy varlet clean,"
4452,BOOK V.,And nits and lice have bred in vain:
4453,BOOK V.,"Just so this bully Greek, for fun,"
4454,BOOK V.,Kick'd the poor rogues by dozens down.
4455,BOOK V.,
4456,BOOK V.,Now Pandarus was stung to th' quick
4457,BOOK V.,To see the knave thus bounce and kick;
4458,BOOK V.,"With all his might his bow he bent,"
4459,BOOK V.,"And a sharp-pointed arrow sent,"
4460,BOOK V.,"Which lent his shoulder such a thump,"
4461,BOOK V.,As made the busy varlet jump;
4462,BOOK V.,One hair-breadth farther had he shot.
4463,BOOK V.,The Greek had surely gone to pot:
4464,BOOK V.,"When Pandarus, brimful of joy,"
4465,BOOK V.,"Roars out, Look here, ye sons of Troy,"
4466,BOOK V.,And view this mighty Grecian fighter;
4467,BOOK V.,I've made the dog some ounces lighter:
4468,BOOK V.,"Kill him, if you dare venture near him;"
4469,BOOK V.,But as it is you need not fear him;
4470,BOOK V.,"For what I've done will surely fell him,"
4471,BOOK V.,"Or Phœbus lies, and that I'll tell him."
4472,BOOK V.,The Lycian boasted thus his might:
4473,BOOK V.,"He boasted, but it prov'd a bite:"
4474,BOOK V.,"For Diom., when he felt it smart,"
4475,BOOK V.,"Popp'd down, and ran behind his cart:"
4476,BOOK V.,"Then call'd his coachman, Hark ye, sirrah,"
4477,BOOK V.,"Come here, and lug me out this arrow."
4478,BOOK V.,The coachman twitch'd his thong about
4479,BOOK V.,"The arrow's head, and whipp'd it out;"
4480,BOOK V.,And then the bully on his bare
4481,BOOK V.,"Kneppers knelt down, and roar'd a pray'r:"
4482,BOOK V.,
4483,BOOK V.,"O virgin Pallas, wise and bold,"
4484,BOOK V.,With whom no brim dare kick and scold!
4485,BOOK V.,"Of thee the men are so afraid,"
4486,BOOK V.,'Tis ten to one thou'lt die a maid;
4487,BOOK V.,For who the pox would venture near
4488,BOOK V.,"A nimble-fisted vixen, where,"
4489,BOOK V.,"Instead of kisses, he, perhaps,"
4490,BOOK V.,Might get a dowsing slap o' th' chaps?
4491,BOOK V.,"If ere thou help'd my good old dad,"
4492,BOOK V.,"When his affairs were bitter bad,"
4493,BOOK V.,And often favour'd his escape
4494,BOOK V.,From many a broil and drunken scrape;
4495,BOOK V.,"Pr'ythee bring help, and cure this scratch,"
4496,BOOK V.,And make thy buck an over-match
4497,BOOK V.,"For that damn'd scrub, that dares pretend"
4498,BOOK V.,To wound the blood that you defend.
4499,BOOK V.,
4500,BOOK V.,"No sooner had he ceas'd to bawl,"
4501,BOOK V.,"But Pallas, ready at his call,"
4502,BOOK V.,"With warm salt water, full as good"
4503,BOOK V.,"As Rock's best styptic, stopp'd the blood;"
4504,BOOK V.,"But finding that it made him grin,"
4505,BOOK V.,She gave him t'other dram of gin:
4506,BOOK V.,"This swell'd him up to such a pitch,"
4507,BOOK V.,That now he felt his finger itch
4508,BOOK V.,"To try his luck at cudgel-play,"
4509,BOOK V.,"Or quarter-staff, or any way."
4510,BOOK V.,
4511,BOOK V.,"Be bold, says Pall., where'er thou go'st,"
4512,BOOK V.,And of this dram pray make the most;
4513,BOOK V.,"There's so much virtue in't, that thou"
4514,BOOK V.,Both gods and mortal scrubs shalt view
4515,BOOK V.,"(For nothing clears the sight from gum,"
4516,BOOK V.,Like a good dram of gin or rum).
4517,BOOK V.,"Shun all their godships if you can,"
4518,BOOK V.,They'll prove too many for mere man;
4519,BOOK V.,"But if you meet the whoring goddess,"
4520,BOOK V.,Ram thy stiff weapon through her boddice;
4521,BOOK V.,"Take care you come not near her thighs,"
4522,BOOK V.,For there a dang'rous mouse-trap lies!
4523,BOOK V.,"Though I am sore afraid you'll miss her,"
4524,BOOK V.,And 'stead of fighting long to kiss her;
4525,BOOK V.,"But if you prove so mighty civil,"
4526,BOOK V.,Myself will send you to the devil.
4527,BOOK V.,"When she appears, don't gaping stand,"
4528,BOOK V.,But use the tool you have in hand;
4529,BOOK V.,"If you grope out for any other,"
4530,BOOK V.,Don't think that I my rage will smother;
4531,BOOK V.,"But will, instead of lending help,"
4532,BOOK V.,"Drub you myself, you whoring whelp!"
4533,BOOK V.,Think not I threaten what I won't
4534,BOOK V.,Perform; for split me if I don't!
4535,BOOK V.,"Then tuck'd her coats up, and bestrode"
4536,BOOK V.,"Her broomstick, and away she rode."
4537,BOOK V.,
4538,BOOK V.,"As on a chop, when hunger calls,"
4539,BOOK V.,"A needy half-pay ensign falls,"
4540,BOOK V.,If the smug waiter stumbling leaves
4541,BOOK V.,"Some drops of grease upon his sleeves,"
4542,BOOK V.,He swears and raves in direful note
4543,BOOK V.,For spoiling of his scarlet coat;
4544,BOOK V.,"The trembling waiters dare not stay,"
4545,BOOK V.,"But nimbly take themselves away,"
4546,BOOK V.,"Afraid of drubbing, kicks, or cuffing,"
4547,BOOK V.,And leave the dreadful captain huffing:
4548,BOOK V.,"Just so Tydides fights and blusters,"
4549,BOOK V.,"And Trojans run, and fall in clusters:"
4550,BOOK V.,"Before, one serv'd his turn; but now"
4551,BOOK V.,His mighty fury kicks down two.
4552,BOOK V.,"But how he manag'd it, and whether"
4553,BOOK V.,"He kick'd with both his legs together,"
4554,BOOK V.,I cannot say; but very soon
4555,BOOK V.,He kick'd a brace of Trojans down:
4556,BOOK V.,"The one was called Astynous,"
4557,BOOK V.,"An honest cock, and one of us;"
4558,BOOK V.,"Hypenor was the other's name,"
4559,BOOK V.,A mighty lover of that same.
4560,BOOK V.,"These left, he took the other kick,"
4561,BOOK V.,And sent two others to Old Nick;
4562,BOOK V.,"Sons of Eurydamas they were,"
4563,BOOK V.,Who was a fortune-teller rare;
4564,BOOK V.,"Whilst men consult for stolen horses,"
4565,BOOK V.,He took good care to steal their purses;
4566,BOOK V.,Yet could he not by magic read
4567,BOOK V.,"This blust'ring rogue, this Diomede,"
4568,BOOK V.,Should drub his sons: so this clean birch
4569,BOOK V.,"Was by the devil left i' th' lurch,"
4570,BOOK V.,Who did not give one hint that he
4571,BOOK V.,The lads again should never see.
4572,BOOK V.,"Thus swimmingly the knave went on,"
4573,BOOK V.,And kill'd two birds with every stone.
4574,BOOK V.,
4575,BOOK V.,"Xanthus the next he laid a blow on,"
4576,BOOK V.,"And then knock'd down his brother Thoon,"
4577,BOOK V.,"The only sons of aged Phænops,"
4578,BOOK V.,Who got much pelf by brown and green hops;
4579,BOOK V.,"But suffering both to list for rangers,"
4580,BOOK V.,His shop and goods now go to strangers.
4581,BOOK V.,As when a lordly bailiff stands
4582,BOOK V.,"With dreadful writs in both his hands,"
4583,BOOK V.,"Poets by pairs he first falls on,"
4584,BOOK V.,And pulls them from their garrets down;
4585,BOOK V.,"So he two fellows, Priam's sons,"
4586,BOOK V.,Fell'd with one stroke upon their bums.
4587,BOOK V.,
4588,BOOK V.,"Æneas saw his townsfolk bleed,"
4589,BOOK V.,Or run away from Diomede:
4590,BOOK V.,Which made him sharply look about
4591,BOOK V.,"To find the brawny Pand'rus out,"
4592,BOOK V.,"To whom the canting Trojan cries,"
4593,BOOK V.,"I'm glad I've found you, smite my eyes!"
4594,BOOK V.,"Those darts of yours, and that long bow,"
4595,BOOK V.,May do a deal of service now:
4596,BOOK V.,"That cursed rogue for God's sake maul,"
4597,BOOK V.,Else he will bruise and lame us all;
4598,BOOK V.,Some angry god's perhaps come down
4599,BOOK V.,"To drub the people of our town,"
4600,BOOK V.,"Because we could not pay our vows,"
4601,BOOK V.,"For want of sheep, and bulls, and cows:"
4602,BOOK V.,"If it be so, we'll then entreat him;"
4603,BOOK V.,"But if he prove a man, let's beat him."
4604,BOOK V.,
4605,BOOK V.,"The Lycian thus: If I can see,"
4606,BOOK V.,"'Tis Diomede: by Jove, 'tis he!"
4607,BOOK V.,Or else it is some god of note
4608,BOOK V.,That wears that scoundrels greasy coat;
4609,BOOK V.,"If 'tis the man, some damn'd old bitch,"
4610,BOOK V.,"A Lancashire or Lapland witch,"
4611,BOOK V.,"Preserves the dog, and out of spite"
4612,BOOK V.,"Helps him to bounce, and kick, and fight."
4613,BOOK V.,"I shot a dart, with aim as true"
4614,BOOK V.,As in my life I ever drew;
4615,BOOK V.,"It gave his shoulder such a thump,"
4616,BOOK V.,I saw the scurvy rascal jump;
4617,BOOK V.,"But some curst Lapland witch, indeed,"
4618,BOOK V.,"Hath stood his friend in time of need,"
4619,BOOK V.,"And out of spite, I thank her for't,"
4620,BOOK V.,Has made my arrow's point stop short.
4621,BOOK V.,"Having a little skill, you know,"
4622,BOOK V.,"At shooting pigeons with my bow,"
4623,BOOK V.,"I thought it best on foot to come,"
4624,BOOK V.,And leave my cart-tits all at home--
4625,BOOK V.,Not but of carriages I've plenty;
4626,BOOK V.,I've got the better half of twenty.
4627,BOOK V.,"My good old daddy, for his part,"
4628,BOOK V.,Persuaded me to trust the cart.
4629,BOOK V.,"Says he, If hap your spits don't gore 'em,"
4630,BOOK V.,You'll break their legs by driving o'er 'em:
4631,BOOK V.,"But I, to saving schemes inclin'd,"
4632,BOOK V.,"Th' old fellow's counsel did not mind,"
4633,BOOK V.,"Turn'd up my nose with scorn, and so"
4634,BOOK V.,"Resolv'd to trust my faithless bow,"
4635,BOOK V.,"Because, my friend, I could not say"
4636,BOOK V.,"If corn was cheap with you, and hay;"
4637,BOOK V.,"Should not your pastures prove extensive,"
4638,BOOK V.,To pay for corn would be expensive;
4639,BOOK V.,"So, like an ass, at Troy you find me,"
4640,BOOK V.,My cart and horses left behind me.
4641,BOOK V.,"With this damn'd bow, a plague confound 'em,"
4642,BOOK V.,"I only scratch, but cannot wound 'em;"
4643,BOOK V.,"Wounding is not a task so easy,"
4644,BOOK V.,Their buff-coats are so hellish greasy:
4645,BOOK V.,"I could, as sure as I was born,"
4646,BOOK V.,Find in my heart to break the horn!
4647,BOOK V.,"A luckless dog! to touch your shore,"
4648,BOOK V.,And not provide himself good store
4649,BOOK V.,"Of broomsticks, half a score or more;"
4650,BOOK V.,And a great banging potlid too;
4651,BOOK V.,I've three at home as good as new.
4652,BOOK V.,
4653,BOOK V.,Æneas answers: Fie for shame!
4654,BOOK V.,"Pray don't your bow and arrows blame,"
4655,BOOK V.,They're Phœbus' gift: with these you may
4656,BOOK V.,At distance ducks and wild geese slay;
4657,BOOK V.,"They have their uses, let me tell ye,"
4658,BOOK V.,When timber's wanting for the belly:
4659,BOOK V.,"And now, if we would play the deuce,"
4660,BOOK V.,The cart and horses are for use.
4661,BOOK V.,"Then, pr'ythee, on the box do you"
4662,BOOK V.,"Nimbly mount up, and drive jehu:"
4663,BOOK V.,"These little tits of mine, I'm sure,"
4664,BOOK V.,Can trot eleven miles an hour.
4665,BOOK V.,"Myself will bid the scoundrel stand,"
4666,BOOK V.,And box the rascal hand to hand;
4667,BOOK V.,Or if you choose that I should flog
4668,BOOK V.,"The horses, you may box the dog."
4669,BOOK V.,
4670,BOOK V.,"Pand'rus replies: Without more tattle,"
4671,BOOK V.,Rule you your own celestial cattle;
4672,BOOK V.,"As for my driving, 'tis a jest,"
4673,BOOK V.,You sure must know to guide 'em best;
4674,BOOK V.,"Besides, if hap that you and I"
4675,BOOK V.,"Should scamper, you can make 'em fly;"
4676,BOOK V.,"With me if resty they should grow,"
4677,BOOK V.,"He might demolish us, you know."
4678,BOOK V.,"Do you be coachman then, and I"
4679,BOOK V.,The mettle of this whelp will try.
4680,BOOK V.,
4681,BOOK V.,"Thus having stated the account,"
4682,BOOK V.,The cart then instantly they mount;
4683,BOOK V.,"With furious haste they drive the cattle,"
4684,BOOK V.,"And, thund'ring, seek the thickest battle."
4685,BOOK V.,"Tydides' 'squire, with half an eye,"
4686,BOOK V.,Quickly perceiv'd 'em drawing nigh;
4687,BOOK V.,"Then cries, Brave Diomede, I see"
4688,BOOK V.,Two lusty lubbers aim at thee;
4689,BOOK V.,One is the son of old Lycaon;
4690,BOOK V.,"T'other, of him that us'd to lay on"
4691,BOOK V.,The goddess Venus: what's his name?--
4692,BOOK V.,"Anchises.--Right, the very same."
4693,BOOK V.,Enough in conscience have you done;
4694,BOOK V.,"Whilst we've good start, e'en let us run:"
4695,BOOK V.,Saving your bacon is the way
4696,BOOK V.,To save us all another day.
4697,BOOK V.,
4698,BOOK V.,"Tydides star'd, and cry'd, What now?"
4699,BOOK V.,"Pray what's the matter, friend, with you?"
4700,BOOK V.,"When Agamemnon only told you,"
4701,BOOK V.,"We durst not fight, I could not hold you;"
4702,BOOK V.,"You kick'd, and danc'd, and bounc'd, and swore,"
4703,BOOK V.,And scolded like a butter-whore:
4704,BOOK V.,I little thought my bold bell-wether
4705,BOOK V.,Had since got shod with running leather:
4706,BOOK V.,Or that he in the least could hope
4707,BOOK V.,I'd run away like Johnny Cope.
4708,BOOK V.,"Not I, by Jove! for all their bouncing,"
4709,BOOK V.,"I'll give their rogueships such a trouncing,"
4710,BOOK V.,"They shall be glad, for all their pother,"
4711,BOOK V.,By leaving one to save the other.
4712,BOOK V.,"I've either got a second sight,"
4713,BOOK V.,"Or else a quaker's inward light,"
4714,BOOK V.,Which tells me I shall slap the chaps
4715,BOOK V.,"Of one of these, or both perhaps."
4716,BOOK V.,"If it should happen in the jumble,"
4717,BOOK V.,"That both these fighting fellows tumble,"
4718,BOOK V.,"As from my soul I wish they may,"
4719,BOOK V.,Mind you remember what I say:
4720,BOOK V.,My horses to my cart-tail tie;
4721,BOOK V.,You'll hear my reason by and by;
4722,BOOK V.,"Then in the empty carriage get you,"
4723,BOOK V.,"And drive, as if the devil split you,"
4724,BOOK V.,Down to the boats.--Æneas brags
4725,BOOK V.,All Europe cannot match these nags:
4726,BOOK V.,"Jove gave 'em to the duke of Troy,"
4727,BOOK V.,Because he stole his little boy;
4728,BOOK V.,Childers or Conqueror cannot
4729,BOOK V.,Gallop so fast as they can trot;
4730,BOOK V.,"The swiftest tits of earthly seed,"
4731,BOOK V.,"Compar'd with these, are dung-cart breed."
4732,BOOK V.,"Anchises, like a cunning elf,"
4733,BOOK V.,Brought mares to cover for himself;
4734,BOOK V.,Four in his stalls are feeding now
4735,BOOK V.,"On barley-straw, besides these two"
4736,BOOK V.,"That draw Æneas: could we catch 'em,"
4737,BOOK V.,Not all our Grecian scrubs can match 'em.
4738,BOOK V.,
4739,BOOK V.,"Whilst thus they talk'd they both came on,"
4740,BOOK V.,And Pandarus the first begun
4741,BOOK V.,
4742,BOOK V.,"Well met, my buff! but, hit or miss,"
4743,BOOK V.,"I'll try again, so take you this:"
4744,BOOK V.,"Where my unlucky bow fell short,"
4745,BOOK V.,My stick shall have a trial for't.
4746,BOOK V.,Then threw his staff; the sudden stroke
4747,BOOK V.,Quite through and through the potlid broke;
4748,BOOK V.,"But, guided by the goddess Luck,"
4749,BOOK V.,It in his greasy buff belt stuck.
4750,BOOK V.,
4751,BOOK V.,I've sous'd him now! the Lycian cries.
4752,BOOK V.,"Not yet, the surly Greek replies:"
4753,BOOK V.,"Your stick has bilk'd your fist, so now"
4754,BOOK V.,I'll let you feel what mine will do:
4755,BOOK V.,"If one or both I do not souse,"
4756,BOOK V.,Minerva's dram's not worth a louse.
4757,BOOK V.,"He said, and, rising on his toes,"
4758,BOOK V.,Lent him a dowse across the nose;
4759,BOOK V.,"Betwixt his eyes the staff drove in,"
4760,BOOK V.,"And bruis'd both nose, and mouth, and chin."
4761,BOOK V.,With such a rattle from the cart
4762,BOOK V.,"He fell, as made the horses start;"
4763,BOOK V.,"Earth groan'd as she receiv'd him tumbling,"
4764,BOOK V.,And the soul left the body grumbling.
4765,BOOK V.,
4766,BOOK V.,"His staff Æneas durst not send,"
4767,BOOK V.,But kept it safe to guard his friend;
4768,BOOK V.,"Turn'd it each way, and whipp'd about,"
4769,BOOK V.,"And kept a dev'lish sharp look-out,"
4770,BOOK V.,For fear the Greeks should steal away
4771,BOOK V.,His greasy jacket as he lay;
4772,BOOK V.,"And did so rave, and curse, and swear,"
4773,BOOK V.,The de'il a Grecian durst go near;
4774,BOOK V.,"When bold Tydides, stooping down,"
4775,BOOK V.,Took up a large Scotch paving-stone--
4776,BOOK V.,Four modern beaux could hardly lift
4777,BOOK V.,"This stone, though six might make a shift--"
4778,BOOK V.,"Flourish'd it round, away it goes"
4779,BOOK V.,Full at the bullying Trojan's jaws
4780,BOOK V.,"But though it did not reach so high,"
4781,BOOK V.,"With such a fury 'twas let by,"
4782,BOOK V.,It wounded both his hip and thigh;
4783,BOOK V.,"The huckle-bone was sorely smash'd,"
4784,BOOK V.,And head o'er heels the warrior dash'd;
4785,BOOK V.,"His swimming eyes perceiv'd a mist,"
4786,BOOK V.,His swimming thighs were sore bepist.
4787,BOOK V.,"By death he'd sure been overtaken,"
4788,BOOK V.,If Venus had not sav'd his bacon;
4789,BOOK V.,"But, mindful of the many slices"
4790,BOOK V.,"She got on Ida with Anchises,"
4791,BOOK V.,The many hours of pleasing fun
4792,BOOK V.,"She spent at getting of this son,"
4793,BOOK V.,"Resolv'd, at any rate or cost,"
4794,BOOK V.,He should not be so poorly lost.
4795,BOOK V.,"Behind my veil, where none can see us,"
4796,BOOK V.,"Thinks she, I'll hide this son Æneas;"
4797,BOOK V.,"So whipp'd him up without delay,"
4798,BOOK V.,And trotted with her prize away.
4799,BOOK V.,
4800,BOOK V.,"Now Sthenelus, the bully's carter,"
4801,BOOK V.,Remember'd what he heard that Tartar
4802,BOOK V.,"His master say, so quickly ty'd"
4803,BOOK V.,His geldings to his carriage side;
4804,BOOK V.,"Then running to the Trojan tits,"
4805,BOOK V.,"Buckled the reins within the bits,"
4806,BOOK V.,Nor did he spare his whip or throat
4807,BOOK V.,Till he had reach'd his master's boat:
4808,BOOK V.,
4809,BOOK V.,"To thee, Deipylus, he cries,"
4810,BOOK V.,I give in charge this mighty prize:
4811,BOOK V.,"Then mounts his cart, and takes the route"
4812,BOOK V.,To find his master kill-cow out.
4813,BOOK V.,"The bully, when he found his prey"
4814,BOOK V.,"Some how or other slipp'd away,"
4815,BOOK V.,"Says to himself, This Madam Venus"
4816,BOOK V.,Has thrown a queerish cloud between us;
4817,BOOK V.,"And, by my sneezing, sure enough"
4818,BOOK V.,'Tis dust of Scotch or Spanish snuff!
4819,BOOK V.,"Should it be so, though faith it odd is"
4820,BOOK V.,"For mortal man to thump a goddess,"
4821,BOOK V.,"Yet since she does me so provoke,"
4822,BOOK V.,I'll try if I can't get a stroke.
4823,BOOK V.,
4824,BOOK V.,"This said, he nimbly ran about"
4825,BOOK V.,To find this Madam Venus out;
4826,BOOK V.,"Through the thick ranks he boldly ventur'd,"
4827,BOOK V.,And with his tool the goddess enter'd:
4828,BOOK V.,"With such a force he drove it in,"
4829,BOOK V.,It made the light-heel'd gipsy grin:
4830,BOOK V.,Straight from the place where he did stick her
4831,BOOK V.,There came a bright transparent liquor
4832,BOOK V.,(Not such queer stuff as flows in common
4833,BOOK V.,When pins are stuck into a woman);
4834,BOOK V.,"Help! murder! murder! Venus cries out,"
4835,BOOK V.,Roaring as if she'd roar her eyes out:
4836,BOOK V.,The devil take this tearing blade;
4837,BOOK V.,"Zoons, what a gap the dog has made!"
4838,BOOK V.,"If Jove protects these sons of bitches,"
4839,BOOK V.,"To treat us thus like Lapland witches,"
4840,BOOK V.,"He'll first repent, for I know well,"
4841,BOOK V.,Give rogues an inch they'll take an ell:
4842,BOOK V.,"I've try'd 'em oft, and find all yet"
4843,BOOK V.,Will squeeze as far as they can get.
4844,BOOK V.,"But what the most my mind doth ruffle,"
4845,BOOK V.,I've lost my bastard in the scuffle.
4846,BOOK V.,"But Phœbus whipp'd amongst the crowd,"
4847,BOOK V.,And wrapt him snug within a cloud.
4848,BOOK V.,
4849,BOOK V.,Tydides then was heard to say
4850,BOOK V.,"To Venus, as she ran away:"
4851,BOOK V.,From broils like these you'd best forbear;
4852,BOOK V.,Pray what the pox should you do here?
4853,BOOK V.,"Go tempt some bawdy judge or warden,"
4854,BOOK V.,Or mind your brims in Covent Garden:
4855,BOOK V.,Let the home-thrust you got to-day
4856,BOOK V.,Teach you from broils to keep away.
4857,BOOK V.,
4858,BOOK V.,"Whilst thus the Grecian chief did prate,"
4859,BOOK V.,"Like drunken whores at Billingsgate,"
4860,BOOK V.,"Poor Venus ran through all the crowd,"
4861,BOOK V.,As if by constables pursu'd;
4862,BOOK V.,"When quickly Madam Iris miss'd her,"
4863,BOOK V.,And flew like lightning to assist her.
4864,BOOK V.,"She found her in a bloody sweat,"
4865,BOOK V.,Her smock from top to bottom wet:
4866,BOOK V.,"At first they thought away to fling it,"
4867,BOOK V.,"Or, upon second thoughts, to wring it;"
4868,BOOK V.,Because the loss of a good smock
4869,BOOK V.,Would make a hole in Venus' stock:
4870,BOOK V.,"But had no time for either way,"
4871,BOOK V.,For Venus swore she durst not stay;
4872,BOOK V.,So with it cleaving round her thighs
4873,BOOK V.,Away to bully Mars she flies.
4874,BOOK V.,"Behind a sutler's tent they found him,"
4875,BOOK V.,"With twenty sutlers' wives around him,"
4876,BOOK V.,"Drinking hot pots with might and main,"
4877,BOOK V.,"Till all their noddles smok'd again,"
4878,BOOK V.,"And made so thick a fog, that she"
4879,BOOK V.,The god at first could hardly see.
4880,BOOK V.,Blubb'ring she tells him she is come
4881,BOOK V.,To beg his car to drive her home;
4882,BOOK V.,Then shows the place where Diomede
4883,BOOK V.,"Had push'd it home, and made her bleed."
4884,BOOK V.,
4885,BOOK V.,"Mars, list'ning, star'd and cock'd his eye,"
4886,BOOK V.,"Then answer'd, Madam, zoons, don't cry,"
4887,BOOK V.,You're welcome to my nags and cart;
4888,BOOK V.,"I'll fetch them quickly, damn my heart[2]"
4889,BOOK V.,"Iris, who farts ten thousand colours,"
4890,BOOK V.,Can drive as smooth as Chelsea skullers.
4891,BOOK V.,"They mount; the nimble horses fly,"
4892,BOOK V.,And in a twinkling reach the sky;
4893,BOOK V.,"Where both alight, put up their steeds,"
4894,BOOK V.,Which Iris with new clover feeds;
4895,BOOK V.,"When Venus to her mammy ran,"
4896,BOOK V.,To make complaint about this man:
4897,BOOK V.,"She rais'd her in her arms, quite sick,"
4898,BOOK V.,And ask'd her where she got that prick.
4899,BOOK V.,
4900,BOOK V.,"No god, quoth she, hath done this hurt,"
4901,BOOK V.,It was a thing made up of dirt;
4902,BOOK V.,"A mortal rogue, call'd Diomede,"
4903,BOOK V.,Has made the queen of beauty bleed;
4904,BOOK V.,"'Gainst Troy they think they've so much odds,"
4905,BOOK V.,"They'll fight both them, and all their gods."
4906,BOOK V.,
4907,BOOK V.,"Dione thus: Have patience, daughter,"
4908,BOOK V.,Fretting will never mend the matter.
4909,BOOK V.,"The gods give plague enough to man,"
4910,BOOK V.,And they return it when they can.
4911,BOOK V.,E'en bully Mars himself lay bound
4912,BOOK V.,For a whole twelvemonth under ground
4913,BOOK V.,"Otus and Epialtus catch'd him,"
4914,BOOK V.,And both together overmatch'd him;
4915,BOOK V.,"And had not Erebœa spy'd him,"
4916,BOOK V.,"And told it Hermes, who unty'd him,"
4917,BOOK V.,"And slily stole the whelp away,"
4918,BOOK V.,He'd been a pris'ner to this day;
4919,BOOK V.,"Nor could the ranting roaring elf,"
4920,BOOK V.,"With all his bullying, help himself."
4921,BOOK V.,"Amphytrion's saucy bastard, you know,"
4922,BOOK V.,"Made a strong push at madam Juno,"
4923,BOOK V.,"And gave her as much pain, she said,"
4924,BOOK V.,As when she lost her maidenhead.
4925,BOOK V.,"Nor could black Pluto, though a devil,"
4926,BOOK V.,Make bully Hercules be civil:
4927,BOOK V.,"But he, as ancient stories tell,"
4928,BOOK V.,"Kick'd this great devil out of hell,"
4929,BOOK V.,"Who, finding home was not secure"
4930,BOOK V.,"From kicks and bruises, ran for cure"
4931,BOOK V.,"To heaven, where Peon rubb'd the chief"
4932,BOOK V.,"With nothing but a plantain leaf,"
4933,BOOK V.,"Which cur'd his batter'd ribs so well,"
4934,BOOK V.,He tripp'd it back quite sound to hell.
4935,BOOK V.,"This Diomede was urg'd by Pallas,"
4936,BOOK V.,Who cares not if he comes to th' gallows;
4937,BOOK V.,"Nor heeds she, be he Jew or Turk"
4938,BOOK V.,That undertakes her dirty work.
4939,BOOK V.,This Diomede shall never see
4940,BOOK V.,"A chatt'ring bastard on his knee,"
4941,BOOK V.,"To cry, when he has ceas'd to roam,"
4942,BOOK V.,"O, mammy, here's my dad come home"
4943,BOOK V.,"For yet, I say, this Diomede"
4944,BOOK V.,By some strong-fisted god may bleed;
4945,BOOK V.,"Then shall his wife, disturb'd in sleep,"
4946,BOOK V.,"Drive all her maids about like sheep,"
4947,BOOK V.,"Shall rave, and roam, and rant, and roar,"
4948,BOOK V.,My strong-back'd husband is no more!
4949,BOOK V.,
4950,BOOK V.,"This said, she squatted on her bum,"
4951,BOOK V.,And wash'd the wounded palm in rum;
4952,BOOK V.,Then to the sore apply'd anon
4953,BOOK V.,The drops of mighty Turlington.
4954,BOOK V.,Juno and Madam Pallas were
4955,BOOK V.,"So pleas'd, they grinn'd from ear to ear;"
4956,BOOK V.,"When Pallas, full of fun and glee,"
4957,BOOK V.,Began a speech with he-he-he:
4958,BOOK V.,
4959,BOOK V.,"Venus, as haps to many a punk,"
4960,BOOK V.,"Has been in such a woeful funk,"
4961,BOOK V.,That how this ugly stroke befell her
4962,BOOK V.,"She hardly knows, so, I must tell her."
4963,BOOK V.,As she a country wench did teach
4964,BOOK V.,"Last night to scratch where't did not itch,"
4965,BOOK V.,By telling her what fun and joy
4966,BOOK V.,"The wenches have that live in Troy,"
4967,BOOK V.,The girl's great clumsy girdle-buckle
4968,BOOK V.,Rubb'd all the skin from off her knuckle.
4969,BOOK V.,
4970,BOOK V.,"Jove laugh'd, and with a merry face"
4971,BOOK V.,"Calls out, Come here, you simple lass;"
4972,BOOK V.,"In shoving-matches you may shine,"
4973,BOOK V.,But don't in bruising-matches join;
4974,BOOK V.,"All day let Mars and Pallas fight,"
4975,BOOK V.,You weapons handle best at night.
4976,BOOK V.,
4977,BOOK V.,"Above stairs whilst they chatted so,"
4978,BOOK V.,Tydides work'd their buffs below.
4979,BOOK V.,"As Venus was too swift to follow,"
4980,BOOK V.,"He turn'd about to box Apollo,"
4981,BOOK V.,"Hoping, if he could make him stop,"
4982,BOOK V.,He might by chance Æneas drop;
4983,BOOK V.,"Three strokes he at Apollo makes,"
4984,BOOK V.,As oft the god his pot-lid shakes;
4985,BOOK V.,"But when he struck again, the Sun"
4986,BOOK V.,"With such a noise a speech begun,"
4987,BOOK V.,The saucy dog was glad to run.
4988,BOOK V.,
4989,BOOK V.,"You whelp! says he, you know, the odds"
4990,BOOK V.,Betwixt your logger-heads and gods
4991,BOOK V.,Is above ninety-nine to one;
4992,BOOK V.,Then what the pox are you upon?
4993,BOOK V.,"We are immortal, can't see death,"
4994,BOOK V.,"Whilst you, like vermin, creep on earth,"
4995,BOOK V.,"Till, having made a stinking rout,"
4996,BOOK V.,"We clap our foot, and tread you out."
4997,BOOK V.,
4998,BOOK V.,"Thus spake the god, with fi'ry face;"
4999,BOOK V.,But Tyd. had wisely left the place.
5000,BOOK V.,"He then the Trojan quickly bore,"
5001,BOOK V.,Where two old women rubb'd him o'er
5002,BOOK V.,"With pilgrim's salve, to cure the sprain,"
5003,BOOK V.,"Which set him on his legs again,"
5004,BOOK V.,"Strengthen'd each part, and heal'd the wound,"
5005,BOOK V.,And in ten minutes made him sound.
5006,BOOK V.,
5007,BOOK V.,Mean time Apollo carv'd a face
5008,BOOK V.,"Of clouds, to take Æneas' place;"
5009,BOOK V.,"The body, head, and arms, and legs,"
5010,BOOK V.,"And jerkin, were as like as eggs."
5011,BOOK V.,"This phantom in the battle stood,"
5012,BOOK V.,And fought as if 'twere flesh and blood;
5013,BOOK V.,"But yet the de'il a soul could wound it,"
5014,BOOK V.,Though bloody blows were struck around it.
5015,BOOK V.,
5016,BOOK V.,"In the mean time, from Troy's high walls"
5017,BOOK V.,To blust'ring Mars Apollo calls:
5018,BOOK V.,"Thou son of Jupiter, and his chief"
5019,BOOK V.,"When he's a mind to do folks mischief,"
5020,BOOK V.,Rise up! and in thy fury seek
5021,BOOK V.,To kill yond' harum scarum Greek.
5022,BOOK V.,"The whelp at Venus push'd, and hit her"
5023,BOOK V.,With a tool large enough to split her;
5024,BOOK V.,"But she, in dangers ever calm,"
5025,BOOK V.,"Receiv'd it in her sweaty palm,"
5026,BOOK V.,"Stopp'd his long staff in mid career,"
5027,BOOK V.,And made it spend its venom there.
5028,BOOK V.,"When his design on Venus mist,"
5029,BOOK V.,"At me the rascal clench'd his fist,"
5030,BOOK V.,"Nor do I make the least dispute,"
5031,BOOK V.,He'll box thy father Jove to-boot.
5032,BOOK V.,
5033,BOOK V.,"Away the battle-monger jogs,"
5034,BOOK V.,Resolv'd to pelt these saucy dogs;
5035,BOOK V.,"But ere the god began to bluster,"
5036,BOOK V.,He thought it best all hands to muster;
5037,BOOK V.,Those scatter'd rogues that ran away
5038,BOOK V.,"He soon brought back, and made 'em stay:"
5039,BOOK V.,"Then slipping on bold Ac'ma's coat,"
5040,BOOK V.,He thus began to tune his throat:
5041,BOOK V.,
5042,BOOK V.,"O Trojans, valiant sons of Priam!"
5043,BOOK V.,May I be shot to death if I am.
5044,BOOK V.,Not quite asham'd to see all hands
5045,BOOK V.,Running away like stout train-bands!
5046,BOOK V.,"Our rogues don't make the least resistance,"
5047,BOOK V.,Yet we don't stir to give assistance;
5048,BOOK V.,My patience is quite gone to see us:
5049,BOOK V.,"Consider but how bold Æneas,"
5050,BOOK V.,"Though stout as Hector ev'ry bit,"
5051,BOOK V.,"Is sore bep--t, if not bes--t!"
5052,BOOK V.,
5053,BOOK V.,"Thus, like an Indian priest, to th' top"
5054,BOOK V.,O' th' house he blew their courage up.
5055,BOOK V.,"Sarpedon felt the first great puff,"
5056,BOOK V.,And thus began to bounce and snuff:
5057,BOOK V.,
5058,BOOK V.,"Hector, says he, I've heard you crack"
5059,BOOK V.,"You would these Grecians' jackets thwack,"
5060,BOOK V.,Without the help of any others
5061,BOOK V.,Except your bastard-getting brothers;
5062,BOOK V.,"But now I see, upon a pinch,"
5063,BOOK V.,The stoutest of you all can flinch;
5064,BOOK V.,"Can gaping stand, or run away,"
5065,BOOK V.,And leave to Hessian troops the fray:
5066,BOOK V.,It matters not a pinch of snuff
5067,BOOK V.,"To me, my farm lies far enough"
5068,BOOK V.,From these damn'd plund'ring rogues in buff.
5069,BOOK V.,"I've plenty there of hay and corn,"
5070,BOOK V.,And a fine child as e'er was born;
5071,BOOK V.,"Besides, as notable a wife"
5072,BOOK V.,As any man can for his life
5073,BOOK V.,Wish to be plagu'd with: yet I cheer
5074,BOOK V.,"My merry men to fight your war,"
5075,BOOK V.,"And, like a busy jackanapes,"
5076,BOOK V.,Bustle to help you out of scrapes;
5077,BOOK V.,"Though I have little cause to fret,"
5078,BOOK V.,From me a sous they cannot get.
5079,BOOK V.,"But Hector idle stands, nor cares"
5080,BOOK V.,How it with other people fares.
5081,BOOK V.,"The bold at thy command, old boy,"
5082,BOOK V.,Will box their very best for Troy:
5083,BOOK V.,"Pr'ythee look sharp, and tell us how"
5084,BOOK V.,To bring ourselves well off just now;
5085,BOOK V.,"Advance you bucks, should Greece attack you,"
5086,BOOK V.,Depend we'll follow close and back you.

5095,BOOK V.,
5096,BOOK V.,Hector made faces at this dose;
5097,BOOK V.,The Lycian rubb'd him up too close;
5098,BOOK V.,"Yet coolly took it in good part,"
5099,BOOK V.,And nimbly leap'd from off his cart;
5100,BOOK V.,"In either hand a staff did shake,"
5101,BOOK V.,That made the boldest Grecian quake;
5102,BOOK V.,"Then turn'd his tatter'd rogues from flight,"
5103,BOOK V.,And led them on again to fight:
5104,BOOK V.,"They turn, look fierce, and scorn to flinch;"
5105,BOOK V.,Nor will the Grecians budge an inch.
5106,BOOK V.,"As in a barn the chaff doth rise,"
5107,BOOK V.,"And fly about the thrasher's eyes,"
5108,BOOK V.,"His well-worn doublet covers quite,"
5109,BOOK V.,And changes greasy brown to white;
5110,BOOK V.,Or as a cockney who attends
5111,BOOK V.,His girl to see her country friends--
5112,BOOK V.,"The youth, to show how well he rides,"
5113,BOOK V.,"Canters along the post-chaise' sides,"
5114,BOOK V.,"Through clouds of dust so thick, that he"

5117,BOOK V.,The colour of his face or clothes:
5118,BOOK V.,"Just so appear'd the Grecian forces,"
5119,BOOK V.,Cover'd with dust by carts and horses.
5120,BOOK V.,"Mars in the middle of 'em stood,"
5121,BOOK V.,With a huge pot-lid daub'd in blood;
5122,BOOK V.,And highly pleas'd he is to follow
5123,BOOK V.,The task assign'd him by Apollo.
5124,BOOK V.,Soon as Minerva went away
5125,BOOK V.,"To drink her tea, and left the fray,"
5126,BOOK V.,"Mars nick'd the time when she was gone,"
5127,BOOK V.,To lead the fainting Trojans on;
5128,BOOK V.,And then produc'd Æneas to
5129,BOOK V.,"His joyful friends in <i>status quo</i>,"
5130,BOOK V.,Attended by a dozen fellows
5131,BOOK V.,That look'd as if they'd 'scap'd the gallows
5132,BOOK V.,What way he came they little care;
5133,BOOK V.,'Twas joy enough to find him there.
5134,BOOK V.,Fierce Discord now began to grumble;
5135,BOOK V.,Apollo made a fearful rumble;
5136,BOOK V.,Fame roar'd with all her hundred tongues;
5137,BOOK V.,Mars almost tore his brazen lungs:
5138,BOOK V.,"In short, so well they play'd the deuce,"
5139,BOOK V.,The Grecians thought all hell broke loose.
5140,BOOK V.,
5141,BOOK V.,"Tydides with great Ajax stood,"
5142,BOOK V.,"Ulysses too, all daub'd with blood,"
5143,BOOK V.,"So firm, you'd think, besides the head,"
5144,BOOK V.,Their bodies too were wood or lead.
5145,BOOK V.,"The Grecians clos'd their files, and then"
5146,BOOK V.,"Expect the foe, like Englishmen."
5147,BOOK V.,"No word was heard through all the host,"
5148,BOOK V.,They look as made of stone or post.
5149,BOOK V.,"Thus, on a sultry summer's day,"
5150,BOOK V.,"When all the winds have ceas'd to play,"
5151,BOOK V.,A cloud of smoke obscures the top
5152,BOOK V.,Of neighbour Drinkall's blacksmith's shop.

5154,BOOK V.,And now great Agamemnon's shanks
5155,BOOK V.,"Kept trotting up and down the ranks,"
5156,BOOK V.,"Setting his knaves in proper rows,"
5157,BOOK V.,And turning out their sweaty toes:

5165,BOOK V.,
5166,BOOK V.,"No more he jabber'd, but on high"
5167,BOOK V.,In air he let his trapstick fly.
5168,BOOK V.,The broomshaft happ'd to light upon
5169,BOOK V.,"A hearty cock, nam'd Deicoon,"
5170,BOOK V.,"Æneas' friend, belov'd by all"
5171,BOOK V.,"The race of Priam, great and small,"
5172,BOOK V.,"Long had he fought in foremost ranks,"
5173,BOOK V.,And oft receiv'd the Speaker's thanks;
5174,BOOK V.,"His potlid, though exceeding tough,"
5175,BOOK V.,"To ward the blow's not strong enough,"
5176,BOOK V.,"The targe is bruis'd, the belt is cut,"
5177,BOOK V.,And lent him a damn'd knock o' th' gut.
5178,BOOK V.,"The stroke dispatch'd the loon to hell,"
5179,BOOK V.,And his teeth chatter'd as he fell.
5180,BOOK V.,"Æneas straight lugs out his stick,"
5181,BOOK V.,"And ply'd his strokes so very thick,"
5182,BOOK V.,"That two bold Grecian bloods, as soon"
5183,BOOK V.,"As you'd count five, he tumbled down;"
5184,BOOK V.,"Their pedigrees if you will trace,"

5192,BOOK V.,They came to help the cuckold Greek
5193,BOOK V.,His cuckold-making wife to seek;
5194,BOOK V.,"Just like two mastiff puppies, which"
5195,BOOK V.,"Had stray'd too early from the bitch,"
5196,BOOK V.,"Ventur'd, before their teeth were grown,"
5197,BOOK V.,"To fight, so both got tumbled down."
5198,BOOK V.,"Great Menelaus fit to cry,"
5199,BOOK V.,Full tilt does at Æneas fly.
5200,BOOK V.,"Mars jogg'd him on to make his stand,"
5201,BOOK V.,And feel the Trojan's heavy hand.
5202,BOOK V.,"This Nestor's chatt'ring bastard 'spies,"
5203,BOOK V.,And quick t' his assistance flies;

5207,BOOK V.,"To know, our labour is in vain."

5209,BOOK V.,"The heroes now had met each other,"

5230,BOOK V.,"His 'squire had turn'd his nags to run,"
5231,BOOK V.,"When in came chatt'ring Nestor's son,"
5232,BOOK V.,"And threw a thumping cobble stone,"

5234,BOOK V.,'Twas follow'd by a knock o' the crown;
5235,BOOK V.,"He drops the reins, and tumbles down."

5242,BOOK V.,
5243,BOOK V.,"All this was seen by valiant Hector,"

5246,BOOK V.,His soldiers follow at a venture.
5247,BOOK V.,"The boldest Greeks he valued not,"
5248,BOOK V.,Since he'd such rare companions got.
5249,BOOK V.,"Bellona fierce, and Mars so grum,"
5250,BOOK V.,Attended closely at his bum.
5251,BOOK V.,Tydides quickly smelt a rat;
5252,BOOK V.,His valiant heart went pit-a-pat.
5253,BOOK V.,"As when a simple country put,"
5254,BOOK V.,"To see his grannum walks on foot,"
5255,BOOK V.,"If running brook comes cross his nose,"
5256,BOOK V.,"And with a mighty bustle flows,"
5257,BOOK V.,"Amaz'd the gaping bumpkin stops,"

5264,BOOK V.,"Smite me, but I've been wond'ring what"
5265,BOOK V.,Could make my heart go pit-a-pat;
5266,BOOK V.,"But now 'tis out, for bully Mars"

5276,BOOK V.,Yet both their pates stern Hector broke;
5277,BOOK V.,"Together in one c'rt they tumbled,"
5278,BOOK V.,And from it both together tumbled.
5279,BOOK V.,"This heavy Ajax chanc'd to see,"
5280,BOOK V.,"Which turn'd his lead to mercury,"
5281,BOOK V.,"And, being a revengeful dog"
5282,BOOK V.,"(Though mostly heavy as a log),"
5283,BOOK V.,"A mopstick with such force he threw,"
5284,BOOK V.,"As bruis'd the breast, and belly too,"
5285,BOOK V.,"Of Amphius, who once as happy"
5286,BOOK V.,"In flocks and herds, and good brown nappy;"
5287,BOOK V.,Yet bravely led his jolly men
5288,BOOK V.,"To Troy, but ne'er went back again."
5289,BOOK V.,"As he fell squash upon his bum,"

5295,BOOK V.,Yet did he venture one bold click
5296,BOOK V.,For the recov'ry of his stick.
5297,BOOK V.,"More he durst not, the foe came on;"
5298,BOOK V.,"He struts away, but scorns to run."

5300,BOOK V.,"Whilst thus they tugg'd, a man there came,"
5301,BOOK V.,"Tlepolemus I think his name,"
5302,BOOK V.,Driving his fiery tits full speed on.
5303,BOOK V.,To get a knock at bold Sarpedon:
5304,BOOK V.,"He was the son of Hercules,"
5305,BOOK V.,"Who did a huge great lion seize,"
5306,BOOK V.,"Pull'd his great beard from off his chin,"
5307,BOOK V.,"And from his body stripp'd his skin,"
5308,BOOK V.,Then with an iron skewer did tack it
5309,BOOK V.,About his shoulders for a jacket;
5310,BOOK V.,"This bully's son, before a stroke"
5311,BOOK V.,"Was struck, to bold Sarpedon spoke:"
5312,BOOK V.,
5313,BOOK V.,"Halloo! you, Mr. Lycian pleader,"
5314,BOOK V.,Pray how the pox 'came you a leader?
5315,BOOK V.,"Your business is, if I judge right,"
5316,BOOK V.,"To puzzle causes, not to fight;"
5317,BOOK V.,Such pretty fellows much I love
5318,BOOK V.,To call themselves the sons of Jove.
5319,BOOK V.,"Pray, Sir, what task was ever set you,"
5320,BOOK V.,To prove some tailor did not get you?
5321,BOOK V.,The de'il a thing have you e'er done
5322,BOOK V.,To prove yourself the Thund'rer's son:
5323,BOOK V.,Nought but a cross-legg'd cabbage-eater
5324,BOOK V.,Could ever get so poor a creature.
5325,BOOK V.,My dad in broils would never flinch:
5326,BOOK V.,We know Jove got him ev'ry inch.
5327,BOOK V.,"He once destroy'd this mighty town,"
5328,BOOK V.,"Like Vernon, with six ships alone;"
5329,BOOK V.,"And these strong walls that look so taking,"
5330,BOOK V.,Are built on rubbish of his making.
5331,BOOK V.,"But who are you, good Mr. Nokes,"
5332,BOOK V.,"That gape as if you'd swallow folks,"
5333,BOOK V.,"And, whilst thy raggamuffins tumble,"
5334,BOOK V.,Dare not so much as seem to grumble?
5335,BOOK V.,"No longer shalt thou stinking stand,"
5336,BOOK V.,But feel the weight of my right hand.
5337,BOOK V.,
5338,BOOK V.,"Whilst thus he like a blackguard spoke,"
5339,BOOK V.,Silence the Lycian gently broke:
5340,BOOK V.,"Your dad, you saucy whelp, 'tis true,"
5341,BOOK V.,Was worth three dozen such as you.
5342,BOOK V.,"These walls he justly tumbled down,"
5343,BOOK V.,Because that rogue Laomedon
5344,BOOK V.,"Had promis'd him a string of horses,"
5345,BOOK V.,Instead of which he gave him curses;
5346,BOOK V.,"Like an old scoundrel vilely us'd him,"
5347,BOOK V.,"And, just as you do me, abus'd him:"
5348,BOOK V.,"You should have been my noisy spark,"
5349,BOOK V.,"A cobler, or a parish-clerk."
5350,BOOK V.,"My name, your family may spread it;"
5351,BOOK V.,In drubbing you there's little credit:
5352,BOOK V.,"But yet, although it hurts my pride,"
5353,BOOK V.,I'll condescend to trim your hide.
5354,BOOK V.,
5355,BOOK V.,"Just at that instant, both on high"
5356,BOOK V.,"Their broomsticks rais'd, and both let fly:"
5357,BOOK V.,"Well aim'd were both: Sarpedon's hit,"
5358,BOOK V.,And his thick brawny neck did split;
5359,BOOK V.,"Made near his throat a hole so big,"
5360,BOOK V.,It bled as if you'd stuck a pig;
5361,BOOK V.,Nor did the other broomstick fly
5362,BOOK V.,"In vain, it bruis'd Sarpedon's thigh;"
5363,BOOK V.,"And had not Jupiter, to save him,"
5364,BOOK V.,Swore that the devil should not have him
5365,BOOK V.,"That bout, I'll venture to be shot"
5366,BOOK V.,If then he had not gone to pot:
5367,BOOK V.,"But in a hurry, from the fray,"
5368,BOOK V.,"His comrades bore him far away,"
5369,BOOK V.,"Though, as they lugg'd him through the throng,"
5370,BOOK V.,They let him drag the stick along;
5371,BOOK V.,"Whether through haste or fear 'twas done,"
5372,BOOK V.,Remains a secret yet unknown.
5373,BOOK V.,"Tlepolemus, who came to scoff,"
5374,BOOK V.,His friends the Grecians lugg'd him off.
5375,BOOK V.,
5376,BOOK V.,Then sly Ulysses angry grew:
5377,BOOK V.,"Shall I, says he, Jove's son pursue;"
5378,BOOK V.,Or shall I smash this Lycian crew?
5379,BOOK V.,"Great Jove and fate forbade the first,"
5380,BOOK V.,But gave him leave to do his worst
5381,BOOK V.,"Amongst the raggamuffins, who"
5382,BOOK V.,Soon found he was but word and blow;
5383,BOOK V.,"For Cromeus he, and bold Alaster,"
5384,BOOK V.,Knock'd with his broomstick down much faster
5385,BOOK V.,"Than boys tip nine-pins; Halius, too,"
5386,BOOK V.,He in his wrath beat black and blue;
5387,BOOK V.,"Prytenis' shoulders next he rubb'd,"
5388,BOOK V.,And then the brave Alcander drubb'd;
5389,BOOK V.,Noemen last of all fell down;
5390,BOOK V.,"And more had been demolish'd soon,"
5391,BOOK V.,"But Hector saw, and ran so fast,"
5392,BOOK V.,He tumbled o'er his head for haste;
5393,BOOK V.,"So eagerly his fury bore him,"
5394,BOOK V.,He drove them all like sheep before him.
5395,BOOK V.,
5396,BOOK V.,"Sarpedon, glad to find him near him,"
5397,BOOK V.,Egg'd that a word or two he'd hear him:
5398,BOOK V.,Don't suffer any Grecian varlet
5399,BOOK V.,To steal my best new coat of scarlet;
5400,BOOK V.,"Pray do not let the rogues so serve me,"
5401,BOOK V.,But from the plund'ring dogs preserve me.
5402,BOOK V.,"If here I should depart this life,"
5403,BOOK V.,"And no more see my loving wife,"
5404,BOOK V.,"Yet in our village let me lie,"
5405,BOOK V.,My death will make th' whole parish cry.
5406,BOOK V.,"With real grief they'll wring their hand,"
5407,BOOK V.,As England did for Cumberland.
5408,BOOK V.,
5409,BOOK V.,Hector for answer nothing spoke:
5410,BOOK V.,But rush'd among the Greeks like smoke:
5411,BOOK V.,"His weapon in their blood he steeps,"
5412,BOOK V.,And drives the scoundrels upon heaps.
5413,BOOK V.,"Sarpedon now, behind a stack"
5414,BOOK V.,"Of hay, was laid upon his back."
5415,BOOK V.,"Lieutenant Polagon was nigh,"
5416,BOOK V.,Who pluck'd the broomstick from his thigh.
5417,BOOK V.,"The soul was flying once away,"
5418,BOOK V.,But thought 'twas better much to stay:
5419,BOOK V.,"For honest Boreas, in a breeze,"
5420,BOOK V.,Whipp'd up his nose and gave him ease.
5421,BOOK V.,
5422,BOOK V.,"The Greeks drew back afraid of Mars,"
5423,BOOK V.,Yet not one Greek would show his a----e:
5424,BOOK V.,"No soldier would expose his back,"
5425,BOOK V.,Though Hector sev'ral sculls did crack.
5426,BOOK V.,"When young, I've heard my granny say."
5427,BOOK V.,That ev'ry dog must have his day;
5428,BOOK V.,"And now 'twas Hector's turn to gall 'em,"
5429,BOOK V.,And with a vengeance did he maul 'em.
5430,BOOK V.,"Mars help'd to cut the matter short,"
5431,BOOK V.,And knock'd the rascals down for sport.
5432,BOOK V.,"First Teuthras fell, who made good cider;"
5433,BOOK V.,"Orestes next, a fam'd rough-rider."
5434,BOOK V.,"Then Trechus, with the rest, was humbled,"
5435,BOOK V.,And Œnomaüs headlong tumbled.
5436,BOOK V.,"Oresbius, though he wore a mitre,"
5437,BOOK V.,Was fool enough to turn a fighter
5438,BOOK V.,"(But, be it spoken to their praise,"
5439,BOOK V.,The priests are wiser now-a-days).
5440,BOOK V.,If now-a-days a priest you find
5441,BOOK V.,"In broils, some wench is in the wind:"
5442,BOOK V.,Much better care our parsons take
5443,BOOK V.,Than ever fight for fighting sake.
5444,BOOK V.,In Yorkshire his preferments lay;
5445,BOOK V.,The farmers rich that heard him pray.
5446,BOOK V.,"Had he been reading th' ev'ning lecture,"
5447,BOOK V.,He'd never been dispatch'd by Hector;
5448,BOOK V.,"But, since he would this trade pursue,"
5449,BOOK V.,E'en as he bak'd well let him brew.
5450,BOOK V.,
5451,BOOK V.,"Juno, a scold past heaven's' matching,"
5452,BOOK V.,For ever spent her time in watching;
5453,BOOK V.,Spies what confounded work was made.
5454,BOOK V.,And thus address'd the fighting jade:
5455,BOOK V.,"Shall all we've done be thus abolish'd,"
5456,BOOK V.,And Greece by yon' vile rogues demolish'd?
5457,BOOK V.,You and myself have pass'd our word
5458,BOOK V.,"(Which they must think not worth a t--d),"
5459,BOOK V.,That Troy's old walls shall very soon
5460,BOOK V.,Be by the Grecians tumbled down.
5461,BOOK V.,"Pray how can this be brought about,"
5462,BOOK V.,If gods for Troy thus fight it out?
5463,BOOK V.,That loggerheaded Mars I spy:
5464,BOOK V.,What think you now if we should try
5465,BOOK V.,To make the scurvy rascal run?
5466,BOOK V.,No sooner was it said than done.
5467,BOOK V.,"They call'd a coach, when out of hand"
5468,BOOK V.,A coach was brought at their command.
5469,BOOK V.,"Hebe, before they mount the car,"
5470,BOOK V.,The axle greas'd with oil and tar.
5471,BOOK V.,"This she perform'd at their desire,"
5472,BOOK V.,Lest they should set the coach on fire;
5473,BOOK V.,"For, as they were in devilish haste,"
5474,BOOK V.,"They knew they should drive hellish fast,"
5475,BOOK V.,"On time I should too much encroach,"
5476,BOOK V.,To tell the beauties of this coach:
5477,BOOK V.,"Let it suffice to say, the maker"
5478,BOOK V.,Exceeded any in Long-Acre;
5479,BOOK V.,A better coach was never seen
5480,BOOK V.,Excepting one:--God save the queen!
5481,BOOK V.,"Juno turns ostler in her fury,"
5482,BOOK V.,And joins the horses in a hurry.
5483,BOOK V.,"Pallas then quickly doffs her clothes,"
5484,BOOK V.,Which on the chamber floor she throws;
5485,BOOK V.,"As modern sluts, worse taught than fed,"
5486,BOOK V.,Do nightly when they go to bed.
5487,BOOK V.,"To make her look more like a Broughton,"
5488,BOOK V.,She whipp'd her father's old buff coat on;
5489,BOOK V.,Then ty'd about his great black targe
5490,BOOK V.,"A band of eels, some small some large,"
5491,BOOK V.,"To lead mankind into mistakes,"
5492,BOOK V.,And make 'em think her eels were snakes.
5493,BOOK V.,Then in the centre did she place
5494,BOOK V.,A most confounded ugly face;
5495,BOOK V.,"But neither Heidegger's nor Nash's,"
5496,BOOK V.,"For theirs were red, this pale as ashes."
5497,BOOK V.,"Jove's skull-cap, so bedeck'd with feather,"
5498,BOOK V.,"Twelve judges' wigs put all together,"
5499,BOOK V.,"Compar'd to it, would sure enough"
5500,BOOK V.,"Seem but a mod'rate barber's puff,"
5501,BOOK V.,She put upon her busy nob;
5502,BOOK V.,"And, that she might complete the job,"
5503,BOOK V.,"In her right hand she pois'd a stick,"
5504,BOOK V.,Long as the may-pole and as thick.
5505,BOOK V.,"The whip-thong cracks, away they go"
5506,BOOK V.,Across the clouds je-up je-o.
5507,BOOK V.,"The Hours took each their turn to wait,"
5508,BOOK V.,And shut or ope the turnpike-gate;
5509,BOOK V.,But such a noise made these two elves
5510,BOOK V.,The gates flew open of themselves.
5511,BOOK V.,"Upwards the foaming steeds they stretch,"
5512,BOOK V.,"And soon the mount Olympus reach,"
5513,BOOK V.,"Where Jove, t' enjoy the breezes cool,"
5514,BOOK V.,Was set upon a three-legg'd stool.
5515,BOOK V.,"Juno now pulls, and swears, and curses,"
5516,BOOK V.,But yet could hardly stop the horses;
5517,BOOK V.,"Then, as she always us'd to do,"
5518,BOOK V.,Falls at him like a vixen shrew:
5519,BOOK V.,
5520,BOOK V.,"To see that Mars rebel, I wonder"
5521,BOOK V.,You can't find bus'ness for your thunder:
5522,BOOK V.,"But here you sit and crack your jokes,"
5523,BOOK V.,To see him smash such heaps of folks.
5524,BOOK V.,"Look down but where yon' Greeks are laid,"
5525,BOOK V.,You'll see what work the dog has made.
5526,BOOK V.,"E'en Venus and Apollo, you know,"
5527,BOOK V.,Are making faces now at Juno.
5528,BOOK V.,"But as to that thick-headed hang-dog,"
5529,BOOK V.,"Venus's bully-back and bang-dog,"
5530,BOOK V.,"That Mars, who makes such woeful rout,"
5531,BOOK V.,"And kicks the Grecians so about,"
5532,BOOK V.,"Only give Pallas leave to douse him,"
5533,BOOK V.,"And ravish me if she don't souse him,"
5534,BOOK V.,"Teach him forbidden ground to roam,"
5535,BOOK V.,And make him glad to scamper home!
5536,BOOK V.,
5537,BOOK V.,Jove answers (pleas'd so soon to part)
5538,BOOK V.,Go drub his hide with all my heart;
5539,BOOK V.,"Pallas the best can tell you how,"
5540,BOOK V.,The wench has pelted him ere now.
5541,BOOK V.,
5542,BOOK V.,"Their car they mounted in a trice,"
5543,BOOK V.,Nor staid they to be bidden twice.
5544,BOOK V.,"Down the new turnpike road they trot,"
5545,BOOK V.,As swift as balls from cannon shot;
5546,BOOK V.,Though part o' th' turnpike was so steeps
5547,BOOK V.,"The horses did not trot, but leap,"
5548,BOOK V.,And at each single bound they took
5549,BOOK V.,They leap'd as far as you can look.
5550,BOOK V.,On earth they fix their nimble feet
5551,BOOK V.,Where Simois and Scamander meet.
5552,BOOK V.,"When Juno made a sort of dew,"
5553,BOOK V.,From which ambrosial clover grew;
5554,BOOK V.,"For heav'nly high-bred steeds, alas"
5555,BOOK V.,Would snuff their nose at common grass;
5556,BOOK V.,"For common grass had one great fault,"
5557,BOOK V.,"'Twas fresh, and Juno's grass was salt."
5558,BOOK V.,"Then through the air they trudg'd on foot,"
5559,BOOK V.,And quickly found that station out
5560,BOOK V.,Where Hector with his wooden sabre
5561,BOOK V.,Did all the Grecian bones belabour.
5562,BOOK V.,A heap of ill-look'd fellows stood
5563,BOOK V.,"Round Diomede, all daub'd with blood:"
5564,BOOK V.,"Whether like lions in your eye,"
5565,BOOK V.,"Or bears, they seem'd, don't signify."
5566,BOOK V.,"Juno was always pretty loud,"
5567,BOOK V.,But most when got into a crowd;
5568,BOOK V.,"And, though she had the best of tongues,"
5569,BOOK V.,She borrow'd Peter Stentor's lungs.
5570,BOOK V.,"This Stentor was a common crier,"
5571,BOOK V.,"And could, or Mrs. Fame's a liar,"
5572,BOOK V.,With downright bawling make more din
5573,BOOK V.,Than any fifty common men.
5574,BOOK V.,
5575,BOOK V.,O scoundrel Greeks! a coward race!
5576,BOOK V.,"In whom of man no mark we trace,"
5577,BOOK V.,Except a damn'd red nose and face!
5578,BOOK V.,"When great Achilles led ye all,"
5579,BOOK V.,The Trojans fought behind their wall;
5580,BOOK V.,"But now they kick you where they please,"
5581,BOOK V.,And soon will kick you o'er the seas.
5582,BOOK V.,
5583,BOOK V.,"As pepper warms your water-gruel,"
5584,BOOK V.,This added to their rage fresh fuel.
5585,BOOK V.,
5586,BOOK V.,In the mean time upon the ground
5587,BOOK V.,Was Diomede by Pallas found;
5588,BOOK V.,"Of a bad thing he made the best,"
5589,BOOK V.,"And by himself his scratch he drest,"
5590,BOOK V.,"Wash'd all the dust and sweat clean out,"
5591,BOOK V.,And wrapp'd it in a greasy clout;
5592,BOOK V.,"Though nought he said, it gave such pain"
5593,BOOK V.,As made him grin and sweat again.
5594,BOOK V.,
5595,BOOK V.,"Whilst thus the loon his scratch was cleaning,"
5596,BOOK V.,Pallas was on his cart-tail leaning;
5597,BOOK V.,When thus the jade began the farce:
5598,BOOK V.,Thou Tydeus' bastard! thou mine a----!
5599,BOOK V.,"Thy father, though his limbs were short all,"
5600,BOOK V.,"Was a bold-hearted fighting mortal,"
5601,BOOK V.,Us'd to drive forward like a devil;
5602,BOOK V.,Myself could hardly make him civil.
5603,BOOK V.,"To Thebes I sent the hungry thief,"
5604,BOOK V.,And there he ate up all their beef;
5605,BOOK V.,Without companion did he venture
5606,BOOK V.,At dinner-time their town to enter;
5607,BOOK V.,Drank for his own share half a barrel
5608,BOOK V.,"Of ale, and then began to quarrel;"
5609,BOOK V.,"Abus'd 'em all for sons of whores,"
5610,BOOK V.,And kick'd the scoundrels out of doors.
5611,BOOK V.,Thee too I've taken greater care of
5612,BOOK V.,Than yet perhaps thou art aware of;
5613,BOOK V.,"But am afraid the goddess Fear,"
5614,BOOK V.,Has drove my fighting champion here.
5615,BOOK V.,
5616,BOOK V.,"Madam, says he, I always knew"
5617,BOOK V.,My obligations great to you;
5618,BOOK V.,"But I must tell you, you disgrace me;"
5619,BOOK V.,Fear dares as well be damn'd as face me.
5620,BOOK V.,I think you said there would be odds
5621,BOOK V.,"Against me, if I fought with gods:"
5622,BOOK V.,"I might, you thought, on Venus venture;"
5623,BOOK V.,"I did, but far I could not enter,"
5624,BOOK V.,Though 'faith a willing stroke I lent her;
5625,BOOK V.,"But in her hand, if I must tell ye,"
5626,BOOK V.,"She caught my tool, and say'd her belly:"
5627,BOOK V.,And now 'tis only to obey
5628,BOOK V.,"Your orders, that I keep away:"
5629,BOOK V.,"For Mars you'll see, if you'll but look,"
5630,BOOK V.,Kicking the Greeks about like smoke.
5631,BOOK V.,
5632,BOOK V.,"Pallas replies, Do you but mind"
5633,BOOK V.,"My good advice, and you shall find"
5634,BOOK V.,"This blust ring whelp, with all his crew"
5635,BOOK V.,"Of bullying scrubs, sha'nt conquer you;"
5636,BOOK V.,"But with your broomstaff, when you meet him,"
5637,BOOK V.,Across the scoundrel's gizzard greet him:
5638,BOOK V.,"A turncoat rogue, that ne'er abides"
5639,BOOK V.,"Three days before he changes sides,"
5640,BOOK V.,"And, without either rhyme or reason,"
5641,BOOK V.,"Helps people, in or out of season!"
5642,BOOK V.,
5643,BOOK V.,"This said, she in an instant knocks"
5644,BOOK V.,"The harmless driver off his box,"
5645,BOOK V.,"Who star'd and gap'd to think that he,"
5646,BOOK V.,Had lost his place so suddenly;
5647,BOOK V.,"Not that he car'd a sixpence for't,"
5648,BOOK V.,But thought the warning mighty short:
5649,BOOK V.,"Then mounting up with nimble feet,"
5650,BOOK V.,Clapp'd her hard bum upon his seat;
5651,BOOK V.,But with her heavy buttocks she
5652,BOOK V.,Had like to've broke the axle-tree.
5653,BOOK V.,"Howe'er, to that she gave small heed,"
5654,BOOK V.,But drove her nags at Mars full speed:
5655,BOOK V.,"Though, lest her nob should get a rap,"
5656,BOOK V.,She slipp'd on Pluto's wishing-cap:
5657,BOOK V.,"This cap, whene'er a head was in it,"
5658,BOOK V.,Became invisible that minute.
5659,BOOK V.,"Just then had Mars, his strength to try,"
5660,BOOK V.,Knock'd down a trooper six feet high;
5661,BOOK V.,"His name, if I mistake not, was"
5662,BOOK V.,"Or Periphus, or Periphas."
5663,BOOK V.,"The bully left him where he fell,"
5664,BOOK V.,And flew at Diomede pell-mell.
5665,BOOK V.,"Though he look'd grim as grim may be,"
5666,BOOK V.,The Grecian look'd as grim as he.
5667,BOOK V.,"Now Mars, because a god, you know,"
5668,BOOK V.,Expected he should have th' first blow;
5669,BOOK V.,"So threw his staff; but Pall, did guide"
5670,BOOK V.,"The steeds so well, it flew quite wide."
5671,BOOK V.,"Then Diomede let fly his stick,"
5672,BOOK V.,Which gave the bully's guts a prick;
5673,BOOK V.,For instantly the hang-dog felt
5674,BOOK V.,The point come through his greasy belt.
5675,BOOK V.,The Greek and Trojan hosts together
5676,BOOK V.,Couldn't make such noise as this bell-wether
5677,BOOK V.,Roaring: he in a stinking mist
5678,BOOK V.,Scamper'd away to heav'n bepist;
5679,BOOK V.,Where at Jove's feet this bullying hulks
5680,BOOK V.,"Sat almost half an hour i' th' sulks,"
5681,BOOK V.,"Then sobb'd as if his heart would break,"
5682,BOOK V.,And blubb'ring made a shift to speak:
5683,BOOK V.,
5684,BOOK V.,I always thought that your commission
5685,BOOK V.,Was given you upon condition
5686,BOOK V.,"That you took care to keep folks quiet,"
5687,BOOK V.,And rather quell than raise a riot;
5688,BOOK V.,"But you so far your orders slight,"
5689,BOOK V.,With gods you let yon' rascals fight;
5690,BOOK V.,"For let me tell you, Mr. Justice,"
5691,BOOK V.,I'll take my oath that all this dust is
5692,BOOK V.,Of your own raising: if your daughter
5693,BOOK V.,"Had had some better manners taught her,"
5694,BOOK V.,"And her hard bum well jerk'd with rods,"
5695,BOOK V.,She'd never thus play'd tricks with gods.
5696,BOOK V.,"Instead of this, you overlook her,"
5697,BOOK V.,And hap will swear that I mistook her.
5698,BOOK V.,"'Tis plain,--so partial you are grown,"
5699,BOOK V.,The jade's a bastard of your own;
5700,BOOK V.,"She now has got a Grecian cully,"
5701,BOOK V.,"One Diomede, a thick-skull'd bully,"
5702,BOOK V.,And him this wheedling cunning puss.
5703,BOOK V.,Has hearten'd up to fight with us.
5704,BOOK V.,"At Venus first he made a stand,"
5705,BOOK V.,And whipp'd his tool into her hand.
5706,BOOK V.,"Me next the whore's-bird drove away,"
5707,BOOK V.,"So thump'd and bruis'd I durst not stay,"
5708,BOOK V.,"Lest, if I dropp'd into a swoon,"
5709,BOOK V.,"These wicked whelps should keep me down,"
5710,BOOK V.,"And, treading on my back and belly,"
5711,BOOK V.,Work all my ribs and guts to jelly.
5712,BOOK V.,
5713,BOOK V.,"Jove, vex'd to th' heart before he spoke,"
5714,BOOK V.,"Thus answer'd, with an angry look:"
5715,BOOK V.,"Has bully Mars forgot his ranting,"
5716,BOOK V.,And ta'en up Whitfield's trade of canting?
5717,BOOK V.,"Dost thou, on whom stern mischief waits,"
5718,BOOK V.,Complain of blows and broken pates;
5719,BOOK V.,"And 'cause so often thou hast got free,"
5720,BOOK V.,Expect for ever to come scot-free?
5721,BOOK V.,"Thou bullying rogue, of all our crew"
5722,BOOK V.,"I hate thee most, by God I do!"
5723,BOOK V.,"From morn to night thou'rt never quiet,"
5724,BOOK V.,Unless when kicking up a riot;
5725,BOOK V.,I do not know of such another
5726,BOOK V.,"In all the world, except thy mother;"
5727,BOOK V.,"And was her sex but chang'd to ours,"
5728,BOOK V.,She'd kick the devil out of doors:
5729,BOOK V.,"But since she says thou art my son,"
5730,BOOK V.,I'll try for once what can be done;
5731,BOOK V.,"Else would I set thee in the stocks,"
5732,BOOK V.,Or chain thy guts to burning rocks;
5733,BOOK V.,"Make thee with wicked Titans roar,"
5734,BOOK V.,A thousand thousand years and more:
5735,BOOK V.,"Then pointing to his man, cries, Stir, John,"
5736,BOOK V.,And ply your heels to fetch a surgeon.
5737,BOOK V.,"Peon soon came. Says he, My cully,"
5738,BOOK V.,Pray do your best to cure this bully.
5739,BOOK V.,"A plague upon his broils and rapes,"
5740,BOOK V.,They always bring him into scrapes.
5741,BOOK V.,
5742,BOOK V.,"The surgeon, though it hardly bled,"
5743,BOOK V.,"Look'd mighty grave, and shook his head,"
5744,BOOK V.,"But fearing it would close of course,"
5745,BOOK V.,"Before he'd time to make it worse,"
5746,BOOK V.,"Whips out his block-tin box, and, faster"
5747,BOOK V.,"Than cits eat custard, spread a plaster,"
5748,BOOK V.,"With which, in less than half an hour,"
5749,BOOK V.,He made a safe and perfect cure;
5750,BOOK V.,But then observe that flesh of gods
5751,BOOK V.,Heals quicker far than ours by odds.
5752,BOOK V.,"Next, by the help of wooden squirt"
5753,BOOK V.,His hands and face he cleans'd from dirt;
5754,BOOK V.,"Then set him on a cushion down,"
5755,BOOK V.,"Where Hebe brought a Scotch-plaid gown,"
5756,BOOK V.,"Which having girt with leathern strap,"
5757,BOOK V.,He next put on a large fur cap.
5758,BOOK V.,"Thus dress'd, or in my word no trust is,"
5759,BOOK V.,The god of battle look'd the justice.
5760,BOOK V.,"And why he may'nt, when battles cease,"
5761,BOOK V.,"Be made a justice of the peace,"
5762,BOOK V.,"I cannot see----On recollection,"
5763,BOOK V.,His want of brains is no objection;
5764,BOOK V.,"No other qualities they need,"
5765,BOOK V.,But just to write their names and read:
5766,BOOK V.,"The trade is learnt in half an hour,"
5767,BOOK V.,To spare the rich and flog the poor.
5768,BOOK V.,
5769,BOOK V.,"Juno and Pallas, having done"
5770,BOOK V.,"The bus'ness they came down upon,"
5771,BOOK V.,"And bully Mars from battle driven,"
5772,BOOK V.,Mount up to drink their tea in heaven.

5826,BOOK VI.,And leave mankind to brew and bake
5827,BOOK VI.,"Just as they please; then broomsticks flew,"
5828,BOOK VI.,"And smoking hot the squabble grew,"
5829,BOOK VI.,Which made Scamander's little flood
5830,BOOK VI.,Get quickly trampled into mud:
5831,BOOK VI.,"In Simois, our bard supposes,"
5832,BOOK VI.,"They came to wash their bloody noses,"
5833,BOOK VI.,"By which 'tis clearly understood,"
5834,BOOK VI.,They fought to th' knees in blood and mud.
5835,BOOK VI.,
5836,BOOK VI.,"Great Ajax first came blust'ring on,"
5837,BOOK VI.,And mischief presently begun.
5838,BOOK VI.,"One Acamas the bully found,"
5839,BOOK VI.,"And fell'd him flat, upon the ground;"
5840,BOOK VI.,"His broomstick lent him such a rap,"
5841,BOOK VI.,As broke his pate and bruis'd his cap.
5842,BOOK VI.,
5843,BOOK VI.,"Axylus next, an honest soul,"
5844,BOOK VI.,Got a great knock o' th' jobbernoul:
5845,BOOK VI.,"At home he always kept good cheer,"
5846,BOOK VI.,And made folks welcome far and near
5847,BOOK VI.,"Close by the road his house did lie,"
5848,BOOK VI.,Where men and horses passing by
5849,BOOK VI.,"Might get a drink, if they were dry:"
5850,BOOK VI.,"Just at the side of Croydon Common,"
5851,BOOK VI.,He kept the sign o' th' Silent Woman
5852,BOOK VI.,"(A silent woman, Sir, you said!"
5853,BOOK VI.,"Pray, was she drawn without a head?"
5854,BOOK VI.,"Yes, Sir, she was: you never read on"
5855,BOOK VI.,A silent woman with a head on).
5856,BOOK VI.,It happ'd that neither guest nor stranger
5857,BOOK VI.,Came by to warn him of his danger;
5858,BOOK VI.,"But as he gap'd, expecting soon"
5859,BOOK VI.,"Some tradesmen, customers from town,"
5860,BOOK VI.,Tydides came and knock'd him down.
5861,BOOK VI.,"Then, at another stroke, this rapster"
5862,BOOK VI.,"Settled Calisius, his tapster."
5863,BOOK VI.,"Euryalus kick'd Dresus down,"
5864,BOOK VI.,And next he crack'd Opheltius' crown;
5865,BOOK VI.,"Not so content, with pairs begins,"
5866,BOOK VI.,"And smash'd two young and tender twins,"
5867,BOOK VI.,"Sons of Bucolion, who had made"
5868,BOOK VI.,"A mistress of a hard-bum'd jade,"
5869,BOOK VI.,Whom in his woods one morn he found
5870,BOOK VI.,Picking dry sticks from off the ground.
5871,BOOK VI.,"As on their backs the younkers lay,"
5872,BOOK VI.,His rogueship stole their coats away.
5873,BOOK VI.,"Just after that, one Polypætes"
5874,BOOK VI.,Dispatch'd Astyalus to greet his
5875,BOOK VI.,"Old friends in hell. Ulysses next,"
5876,BOOK VI.,"Because the rogues his soul had vex'd,"
5877,BOOK VI.,"Murder'd Pydites: then comes Teucer,"
5878,BOOK VI.,"And made poor Aretaon spew, Sir;"
5879,BOOK VI.,"When, in a rage, ran Nestor's lad,"
5880,BOOK VI.,Chatt'ring just like his queer old dad;
5881,BOOK VI.,"I'll make these Trojan rascals fear us,"
5882,BOOK VI.,And straight demolish'd brave Ablerus;
5883,BOOK VI.,"Which when great Agamemnon saw,"
5884,BOOK VI.,"He gave Elatus such a blow,"
5885,BOOK VI.,"As fell'd him down upon his crupper,"
5886,BOOK VI.,And spoil'd the luckless Trojan's supper.
5887,BOOK VI.,"Such a damn'd knock the Grecian gave him,"
5888,BOOK VI.,That all his money could not save him.
5889,BOOK VI.,"Eurypylus Melanthius slew,"
5890,BOOK VI.,"And Phylacus from Leitus flew,"
5891,BOOK VI.,But could not 'scape him any how.
5892,BOOK VI.,"Adrastus, by ill luck, came bump"
5893,BOOK VI.,Upon a cursed crab-tree stump;
5894,BOOK VI.,"It smash'd his wheels, both nave and spoke,"
5895,BOOK VI.,And all the cart to pieces broke.
5896,BOOK VI.,"The horses flew where none could find 'em,"
5897,BOOK VI.,"And left their luckless load behind 'em,"
5898,BOOK VI.,"As he lay kicking on the sands,"
5899,BOOK VI.,"The cuckold o'er him threat'ning stands,"
5900,BOOK VI.,"Pilgarlick lifts his hands on high,"
5901,BOOK VI.,And begs for life most lustily:
5902,BOOK VI.,
5903,BOOK VI.,"May't please your honour let me live,"
5904,BOOK VI.,A good round sum my dad will give:
5905,BOOK VI.,"When he for my great loss has wept,"
5906,BOOK VI.,"And finds I'm but in limbo kept,"
5907,BOOK VI.,"Depend he then will give, for ransom,"
5908,BOOK VI.,A purse with something very handsome.
5909,BOOK VI.,
5910,BOOK VI.,He spoke: the honest cuckold's pity
5911,BOOK VI.,Was touch'd by this half mournful ditty;
5912,BOOK VI.,"But Agamemnon, in a fury,"
5913,BOOK VI.,"Just like an English thick-scull'd jury,"
5914,BOOK VI.,Destroy'd all pity in a hurry.
5915,BOOK VI.,
5916,BOOK VI.,"Quoth he, Th' old boy shall double damn me,"
5917,BOOK VI.,Before I'll let a Trojan flam me!
5918,BOOK VI.,Christians give scoundrels good for evil;
5919,BOOK VI.,But let us smoke 'em to the devil.
5920,BOOK VI.,"I live in hopes that Troy will fall,"
5921,BOOK VI.,"Their whores, and rogues, and brats, and all,"
5922,BOOK VI.,"That other whoring whelps, discerning"
5923,BOOK VI.,"Their wicked exit, may take warning,"
5924,BOOK VI.,"Nor rove about from street to street,"
5925,BOOK VI.,To cuckold every man they meet.
5926,BOOK VI.,
5927,BOOK VI.,"This speech he made with dreadful ire,"
5928,BOOK VI.,"And set the cuckold's blood on fire,"
5929,BOOK VI.,Who swore he would not grant the boon;
5930,BOOK VI.,"So Agamemnon knock'd him down,"
5931,BOOK VI.,"And, spite of all the Trojan's tears,"
5932,BOOK VI.,Batter'd his brains about his ears.
5933,BOOK VI.,
5934,BOOK VI.,"Nestor, who saw this bus'ness done,"
5935,BOOK VI.,Like an old harden'd rogue look'd on;
5936,BOOK VI.,"Then cries, My lads, in this tough job,"
5937,BOOK VI.,"Don't stay to pick a single fob,"
5938,BOOK VI.,"But, after we have work'd their buff,"
5939,BOOK VI.,We then shall all have chink enough.
5940,BOOK VI.,
5941,BOOK VI.,"Now Greece had surely got the day,"
5942,BOOK VI.,"And Troy as surely run away,"
5943,BOOK VI.,But wisely Helenus prepares
5944,BOOK VI.,"To mend their bitter bad affairs,"
5945,BOOK VI.,And bring 'em (since they durst not stand)
5946,BOOK VI.,Out of this scrape by slight-of-hand.
5947,BOOK VI.,
5948,BOOK VI.,When thus to Hector and Æneas
5949,BOOK VI.,"He tells his mind: Old friends, you see us"
5950,BOOK VI.,"Sorely put to't; but yet 'tis true,"
5951,BOOK VI.,The gods have left it all to you
5952,BOOK VI.,"To bring us off; for, at this pinch,"
5953,BOOK VI.,"The de'il a god will stir an inch,"
5954,BOOK VI.,But now look on in expectation
5955,BOOK VI.,"That you yourself, on this occasion,"
5956,BOOK VI.,"Will try your utmost strength and cunning,"
5957,BOOK VI.,To stop your ragged rogues from running.
5958,BOOK VI.,"When you have cheer'd each heartless tup,"
5959,BOOK VI.,Leave it to us to keep it up.
5960,BOOK VI.,"Mean time, you Hector, go, I pray,"
5961,BOOK VI.,To our old mother Hecuba;
5962,BOOK VI.,"Tell her, she must forthwith employ"
5963,BOOK VI.,"The oldest maids we have in Troy,"
5964,BOOK VI.,"And bid 'em cease their lies and malice,"
5965,BOOK VI.,"To go and pray to Madam Pallas,"
5966,BOOK VI.,Who is by fits as cross a jade
5967,BOOK VI.,As any wrinkled mortal maid;
5968,BOOK VI.,Then bid them lay upon her knee
5969,BOOK VI.,The richest satin negligee
5970,BOOK VI.,My mother has in all her store:
5971,BOOK VI.,"If finely daub'd with tinsel o'er,"
5972,BOOK VI.,"'Twill stand the better chance to please her,"
5973,BOOK VI.,"And may, by great good luck, appease her."
5974,BOOK VI.,"Then let 'em add, if more she choose,"
5975,BOOK VI.,We'll send a dozen maiden cows.
5976,BOOK VI.,"These things, unless the devil's in her,"
5977,BOOK VI.,I'm pretty sure can't fail to win her
5978,BOOK VI.,"To spare our hen-peck'd cuckolds' lives,"
5979,BOOK VI.,"With all our brawling brats and wives,"
5980,BOOK VI.,Nor longer suffer Diomede
5981,BOOK VI.,To make the Trojans' noses bleed.
5982,BOOK VI.,"Such thumps he lends our soldiers, that"
5983,BOOK VI.,To him Achilles seems a sprat.
5984,BOOK VI.,"This speech bold Hector heard, and plump"
5985,BOOK VI.,From off his cart he took a jump;
5986,BOOK VI.,"Ran where he found the varlets slack,"
5987,BOOK VI.,And cheer'd them with a clap o' th' back.
5988,BOOK VI.,"To such a pitch does he restore 'em,"
5989,BOOK VI.,They drive the Grecian bloods before 'em.
5990,BOOK VI.,"Two staves he brandish'd in the air,"
5991,BOOK VI.,"So thick they made the Grecians stare,"
5992,BOOK VI.,"Who thought the Trojans, to resist 'em,"
5993,BOOK VI.,Had hir'd some goblin to assist 'em.
5994,BOOK VI.,
5995,BOOK VI.,Then Hector spoke as loud as thunder:
5996,BOOK VI.,"Hear! all ye roaring sons of plunder,"
5997,BOOK VI.,"Ye Dardans of the nearer stations,"
5998,BOOK VI.,"And those who come from distant nations,"
5999,BOOK VI.,Think on your valiant fathers' tasks!
6000,BOOK VI.,"'Tis all, in troth, that Hector asks."
6001,BOOK VI.,Whilst I a little bus'ness do
6002,BOOK VI.,"In Troy, the squabble rests on you."
6003,BOOK VI.,"I go to bid our grandames all,"
6004,BOOK VI.,"And old maids, on their kneppers fall:"
6005,BOOK VI.,"The pray'rs they mumble will, no doubt,"
6006,BOOK VI.,Help us to thrash the Greeks this bout.
6007,BOOK VI.,
6008,BOOK VI.,"He said no more, but took a stride,"
6009,BOOK VI.,Miss P----s-us' hoop's not half so wide;
6010,BOOK VI.,"Then threw his potlid o'er his back,"
6011,BOOK VI.,And to the Trojan gates did pack.
6012,BOOK VI.,This mighty orb of brass and steel
6013,BOOK VI.,"Reach'd from his neck well nigh his heel,"
6014,BOOK VI.,"Which kicking as he walk'd along,"
6015,BOOK VI.,Like an old postman's bell it rung.
6016,BOOK VI.,"Now, Hector gone, both sides think fit"
6017,BOOK VI.,To take their wind a little bit;
6018,BOOK VI.,"When Glaucus, and that Grecian spark,"
6019,BOOK VI.,"Tydides, did each other mark."
6020,BOOK VI.,"Both in one mind, they bounce and kick,"
6021,BOOK VI.,And each man flourishes his stick;
6022,BOOK VI.,"When Diom., though no talking man,"
6023,BOOK VI.,"Was first to speak, and thus began:"
6024,BOOK VI.,
6025,BOOK VI.,"Your face I ne'er before did see,"
6026,BOOK VI.,"Pray, who the devil can you be,"
6027,BOOK VI.,"Who dares to beard that Diomede,"
6028,BOOK VI.,That makes so many noses bleed?
6029,BOOK VI.,"Those that meet me make small resistance,"
6030,BOOK VI.,"When Pallas lends me her assistance,"
6031,BOOK VI.,And that she will do all this week:
6032,BOOK VI.,"If therefore you're a god, pray speak;"
6033,BOOK VI.,"For, if you are, my staff can't fright you,"
6034,BOOK VI.,But smite my liver if I'll fight you!
6035,BOOK VI.,"I've had my share enough of evils,"
6036,BOOK VI.,And box no more with gods and devils;
6037,BOOK VI.,"For, happen as it may, i' th' end on't,"
6038,BOOK VI.,"They'll sit upon your skirts, depend on't."
6039,BOOK VI.,"You know Lycurgus did not fear 'em,"
6040,BOOK VI.,"But, to his cost, he came too near 'em."
6041,BOOK VI.,"He scar'd the god of wine for fun,"
6042,BOOK VI.,And made his drunken messmates run.
6043,BOOK VI.,"Their spears, with vines and ivy bound,"
6044,BOOK VI.,Lay scatter'd all along the ground;
6045,BOOK VI.,"And Bacchus too, to hide his head,"
6046,BOOK VI.,Crept to his cousin Thetis' bed.
6047,BOOK VI.,But soon their angry godships sent
6048,BOOK VI.,The devil of a punishment:
6049,BOOK VI.,"For, whilst he slept, they, by surprise,"
6050,BOOK VI.,Ran needles into both his eyes;
6051,BOOK VI.,Then drove him through the world so wide
6052,BOOK VI.,"To beg his bread without a guide,"
6053,BOOK VI.,Nor would allow th' unlucky king
6054,BOOK VI.,A dog to lead him in a string:
6055,BOOK VI.,"By which he got so badly serv'd,"
6056,BOOK VI.,In less than half a year he starv'd.
6057,BOOK VI.,"I fight no gods; but, if a man"
6058,BOOK VI.,"Thou art, I'll drub thee if I can."
6059,BOOK VI.,"Some devil, sure, has made thee judge ill,"
6060,BOOK VI.,To come so near my fatal cudgel.
6061,BOOK VI.,
6062,BOOK VI.,"Glaucus replies: Great Sir, since you"
6063,BOOK VI.,"From whence I came desire to know,"
6064,BOOK VI.,"Attend, I'll tell a tale so rare,"
6065,BOOK VI.,Were you stone blind 'twould make you stare.
6066,BOOK VI.,"You know the gang of nine-pins, soon"
6067,BOOK VI.,"As the bowl hits, come tumbling down;"
6068,BOOK VI.,"Then are set up, when that throw's o'er,"
6069,BOOK VI.,To tumble as they did before.
6070,BOOK VI.,"Just so a race that's always grumbling,"
6071,BOOK VI.,"The race of mortal rogues, keeps tumbling."
6072,BOOK VI.,"This d'ye see's by way of text,"
6073,BOOK VI.,"And, if your patience won't be vext,"
6074,BOOK VI.,My pedigree is coming next.
6075,BOOK VI.,"Listen, and, if your ears don't fail,"
6076,BOOK VI.,You'll hear an oddish kind of tale;
6077,BOOK VI.,"But ev'ry syllable is true,"
6078,BOOK VI.,Or slam me if I'd tell it you!
6079,BOOK VI.,"Near Argos, fam'd for roguish coopers,"
6080,BOOK VI.,"And breeding horses fit for troopers,"
6081,BOOK VI.,A city stands upon that coast
6082,BOOK VI.,"Where Sysiphus once rul'd the roast,"
6083,BOOK VI.,"Glaucus, this Sisyphus's son,"
6084,BOOK VI.,"Was father of Bellerophon,"
6085,BOOK VI.,"Who was, to tell the real truth,"
6086,BOOK VI.,"A very comely, hopeful youth."
6087,BOOK VI.,Because he topp'd all other fellows
6088,BOOK VI.,"In beauty, Prestus would be jealous;"
6089,BOOK VI.,"And, being but a sort of Turk,"
6090,BOOK VI.,He kept this younker hard at work.
6091,BOOK VI.,"'Tis true Antea, or I miss her,"
6092,BOOK VI.,Wanted Bellerophon to kiss her:
6093,BOOK VI.,"Nay more, she plainly told him so;"
6094,BOOK VI.,"But he, like Joseph, answered, No!"
6095,BOOK VI.,For which our beaux all think he was
6096,BOOK VI.,An animal they call an ass.
6097,BOOK VI.,"Howe'er, the hussey told her spouse,"
6098,BOOK VI.,He try'd to be about her house:
6099,BOOK VI.,"And, though he scorn'd to come so nigh it,"
6100,BOOK VI.,The brimstone swore he took her by it.
6101,BOOK VI.,
6102,BOOK VI.,No sooner was th' old fellow told
6103,BOOK VI.,"This youth attack'd his copyhold,"
6104,BOOK VI.,"But he was bloody wroth, d'ye see,"
6105,BOOK VI.,As any honest man might be;
6106,BOOK VI.,"But, as the younker was his guest,"
6107,BOOK VI.,He judg'd it would be for the best
6108,BOOK VI.,(To save the youth from being hurt
6109,BOOK VI.,Within the liberties of court)
6110,BOOK VI.,"To send him to some foreign shore,"
6111,BOOK VI.,In hopes to hear of him no more.
6112,BOOK VI.,What could the bubbled king do better
6113,BOOK VI.,Than cheat him with Uriah's letter?
6114,BOOK VI.,"And thus, as if some good was meant him,"
6115,BOOK VI.,"The jealous rogue to Lycia sent him,"
6116,BOOK VI.,"To the old daddy of his wife,"
6117,BOOK VI.,In hopes he there would lose his life;
6118,BOOK VI.,Not doubting but the whelp he'd slaughter
6119,BOOK VI.,For off'ring to corrupt his daughter.
6120,BOOK VI.,
6121,BOOK VI.,"Away then goes Bellerophon,"
6122,BOOK VI.,Unknowing what he went upon;
6123,BOOK VI.,Enter'd the Lycian palace drest
6124,BOOK VI.,"In a full suit, his very best."
6125,BOOK VI.,"The good old monarch did bestir him,"
6126,BOOK VI.,And made nine days' bull-baitings for him;
6127,BOOK VI.,"But the tenth morning took him out,"
6128,BOOK VI.,And ask'd him what he came about?
6129,BOOK VI.,"On which he fumbled in his jacket,"
6130,BOOK VI.,And lugg'd him out the famous packet.
6131,BOOK VI.,This quickly made the errand known
6132,BOOK VI.,The harmless lad was sent upon.
6133,BOOK VI.,"The good old Lycian, with surprise,"
6134,BOOK VI.,"First rubb'd, then read, then rubb'd his eyes;"
6135,BOOK VI.,"But, finding matters were no better,"
6136,BOOK VI.,He e'en resolv'd t' obey the letter;
6137,BOOK VI.,"So sent him out to fight Chimera,"
6138,BOOK VI.,A mottled monster rough as bear-a.
6139,BOOK VI.,"Her bum was dragon, body goat,"
6140,BOOK VI.,"A lion's neck, and head, and throat;"
6141,BOOK VI.,No living mortal durst come nigh her
6142,BOOK VI.,"She farted smoke, and belch'd up fire."
6143,BOOK VI.,"Bellerophon could read the sky,"
6144,BOOK VI.,When the stars happen'd to be nigh;
6145,BOOK VI.,"So cast a figure, as 'tis said,"
6146,BOOK VI.,Then quickly knock'd this beast o' th' head.
6147,BOOK VI.,"As he return'd, he next gave chase,"
6148,BOOK VI.,"And kill'd the Solymæan race,"
6149,BOOK VI.,"A pack of ranting roaring fellows,"
6150,BOOK VI.,As ever grac'd a three-legg'd gallows.
6151,BOOK VI.,"To them the Amazons succeed,"
6152,BOOK VI.,A strange hermaphroditish breed:
6153,BOOK VI.,"No mortal man these jades could match,"
6154,BOOK VI.,"'Cause they could scold, and bite, and scratch;"
6155,BOOK VI.,"But, by the help of cod and oysters,"
6156,BOOK VI.,He quickly tam'd this crew of roysters:
6157,BOOK VI.,"Soon as they felt his strokes and thwacks,"
6158,BOOK VI.,The brims all fell upon their backs.
6159,BOOK VI.,"Though here his troubles did not cease,"
6160,BOOK VI.,Nor was he yet to live in peace.
6161,BOOK VI.,Under a farmer's old pigsty
6162,BOOK VI.,A dozen rogues conceal'd did lie;
6163,BOOK VI.,"But, when he got them in his clutches,"
6164,BOOK VI.,"He qualify'd them all for crutches,"
6165,BOOK VI.,"Left 'em so bruis'd upon the plain,"
6166,BOOK VI.,Not one could limp it home again.
6167,BOOK VI.,
6168,BOOK VI.,"Zooks! said the king, I'll lay a groat,"
6169,BOOK VI.,There's more in this than first I thought:
6170,BOOK VI.,"This man can be no earth-born clod,"
6171,BOOK VI.,But bastard to some whoring god.
6172,BOOK VI.,"A fellow that can make such slaughter,"
6173,BOOK VI.,"And would have trimm'd my other daughter,"
6174,BOOK VI.,"Since he by some strange chance has mist her,"
6175,BOOK VI.,I think I'll let him trim her sister;
6176,BOOK VI.,"And, that the youth the girl may keep,"
6177,BOOK VI.,I'll take him into partnership.
6178,BOOK VI.,"My trade he'll learn, I do not fear,"
6179,BOOK VI.,In far less time than half a year;
6180,BOOK VI.,"'Tis but to kick, and cuff, and swear."
6181,BOOK VI.,"I knew a good old monarch that,"
6182,BOOK VI.,"When angry, only kick'd his hat:"
6183,BOOK VI.,"Now, when I'm vex'd, both friends and foes"
6184,BOOK VI.,Have felt the force of my square toes.
6185,BOOK VI.,"Favours once got, they come none near you;"
6186,BOOK VI.,"But kick 'em, and they always fear you:"
6187,BOOK VI.,And this I ever will maintain
6188,BOOK VI.,The best and easiest way to reign.
6189,BOOK VI.,
6190,BOOK VI.,"No sooner was it said than done,"
6191,BOOK VI.,He made him partner of his throne;
6192,BOOK VI.,I mean the very morning after
6193,BOOK VI.,He'd done his best to please his daughter:
6194,BOOK VI.,"For she, when ask'd of his behaviour,"
6195,BOOK VI.,Had spoken greatly in his favour;
6196,BOOK VI.,"And swore, like royal F----'s[1] wife,"
6197,BOOK VI.,She ne'er was thrum'd so in her life;
6198,BOOK VI.,On which the Lycians gave him stone
6199,BOOK VI.,"And ground to build a house upon,"
6200,BOOK VI.,"With a good orchard full of fruit,"
6201,BOOK VI.,And a brave field of wheat to boot.
6202,BOOK VI.,
6203,BOOK VI.,"Long did he reign in peace and plenty,"
6204,BOOK VI.,"Full nineteen years, though some say twenty."
6205,BOOK VI.,"Two sons he had, and eke one daughter,"
6206,BOOK VI.,"So fair, she caus'd Jove's chaps to water,"
6207,BOOK VI.,"Who made no words, but whipp'd upon her,"
6208,BOOK VI.,And got the brave Sarpedon on her.
6209,BOOK VI.,"At last attack'd by falling fits,"
6210,BOOK VI.,"Which rather hurt his little wits,"
6211,BOOK VI.,"Alone o'er hills and dales he ran,"
6212,BOOK VI.,And would not bear the sight of man.
6213,BOOK VI.,"Whilst thus he roam'd amongst the cattle,"
6214,BOOK VI.,His eldest son was slain in battle:
6215,BOOK VI.,"And Mrs. Phœbe, one dark night,"
6216,BOOK VI.,Shot his poor daughter out of spite;
6217,BOOK VI.,"Fearing next time Jove got upon her,"
6218,BOOK VI.,He hap might make a goddess on her.
6219,BOOK VI.,"Hippolachus was left, and he,"
6220,BOOK VI.,"That same Hippolachus, got me:"
6221,BOOK VI.,"By his direction here I swagger,"
6222,BOOK VI.,And value no man's sword or dagger.
6223,BOOK VI.,I always choose the first to stand
6224,BOOK VI.,"In fight, as well as in command;"
6225,BOOK VI.,And always am the first to try
6226,BOOK VI.,To storm a trench or mutton-pie:
6227,BOOK VI.,My father's fame in future story
6228,BOOK VI.,Shall fall far short of mine in glory.
6229,BOOK VI.,
6230,BOOK VI.,"The Grecian, when he heard this tale,"
6231,BOOK VI.,Jump'd up as brisk as bottled ale;
6232,BOOK VI.,"Down went his broomshaft on the sands,"
6233,BOOK VI.,"And taking Glaucus by the hands,"
6234,BOOK VI.,"Whilst both his sweaty palms he press'd,"
6235,BOOK VI.,"He cries, You are my ancient guest;"
6236,BOOK VI.,"And therefore, as the matter stands,"
6237,BOOK VI.,Let us without deceit shake hands.
6238,BOOK VI.,Your grandsire was my grand-dad's guest
6239,BOOK VI.,For twenty days he did him feast
6240,BOOK VI.,"With mutton-chops, and tart, and custard,"
6241,BOOK VI.,And humming beer as strong as mustard:
6242,BOOK VI.,Thy grandsire on the twentieth day
6243,BOOK VI.,Was pleas'd to take himself away;
6244,BOOK VI.,Because he guess'd he very nigh
6245,BOOK VI.,Had drank th' old fellow's cellars dry:
6246,BOOK VI.,But to his landlord first thought proper
6247,BOOK VI.,To give a can hoop'd round with copper;
6248,BOOK VI.,"Who straight amidst his lumber felt,"
6249,BOOK VI.,"And fumbled out an old sword-belt,"
6250,BOOK VI.,Which in return he then presented;
6251,BOOK VI.,And thus their friendship was cemented.
6252,BOOK VI.,"Brimful of porter, when I'm able,"
6253,BOOK VI.,"This can is fill'd for my own table,"
6254,BOOK VI.,"'Tis from this can I learnt this story,"
6255,BOOK VI.,Which I have laid so plain before you;
6256,BOOK VI.,"For my poor dad, though stout and strong,"
6257,BOOK VI.,Let slip his wind when I was young;
6258,BOOK VI.,"Nor had th' old Grecian time to spare,"
6259,BOOK VI.,To teach his lad a single prayer:
6260,BOOK VI.,"I shame to tell the truth, but all"
6261,BOOK VI.,"The prayers that I can say, I stole."
6262,BOOK VI.,But from this day let you and I
6263,BOOK VI.,Assist each other by the by:
6264,BOOK VI.,"If ever I should travel more,"
6265,BOOK VI.,Flux me if I will pass your door!
6266,BOOK VI.,"And if my country you should see,"
6267,BOOK VI.,Pray come and take pot-luck with me.
6268,BOOK VI.,Enough of Trojan pates there are
6269,BOOK VI.,For me to break in this damn'd war;
6270,BOOK VI.,"And there will be, I'm sure, no lack"
6271,BOOK VI.,Of Grecian skulls for you to crack:
6272,BOOK VI.,"So let what will befall the rout,"
6273,BOOK VI.,Pray why should you and I fall out?
6274,BOOK VI.,To show each host we scorn to bubble it;
6275,BOOK VI.,"Let me have yours, and here's my doublet."
6276,BOOK VI.,
6277,BOOK VI.,Though now-a-days so bold a push
6278,BOOK VI.,Would make an honest Hebrew blush.
6279,BOOK VI.,Yet this queer varlet Diomede
6280,BOOK VI.,Did most amazingly succeed;
6281,BOOK VI.,For his buff coat both greas'd and old
6282,BOOK VI.,He got a new one lac'd with gold.
6283,BOOK VI.,"His mighty buff-skin coat of coats,"
6284,BOOK VI.,"When new, had cost him just nine groats;"
6285,BOOK VI.,I think I speak the very most;
6286,BOOK VI.,But Glaucus's a hundred cost;
6287,BOOK VI.,"Though his great princely soul was such,"
6288,BOOK VI.,He did not value twice as much.
6289,BOOK VI.,
6290,BOOK VI.,"Whilst Diomede this chief was tricking,"
6291,BOOK VI.,"Hector his brazen shield was kicking,"
6292,BOOK VI.,"And strode along at such a rate,"
6293,BOOK VI.,"He'd got within the Scæan Gate,"
6294,BOOK VI.,"Under a tree o'ergrown with moss,"
6295,BOOK VI.,That serv'd 'em for a market-cross.
6296,BOOK VI.,Close by the whipping-post and stocks.
6297,BOOK VI.,Bold Hector met with sundry flocks
6298,BOOK VI.,"Of soldiers' wives, and many others,"
6299,BOOK VI.,"Asking for husbands, sons, and brothers."
6300,BOOK VI.,"So bad, says he, with us it fares,"
6301,BOOK VI.,I'd have ye all go say your prayers.
6302,BOOK VI.,With hasty strides away he tramp'd
6303,BOOK VI.,"To Priam's palace, newly vamp'd,"
6304,BOOK VI.,"Near which was half a hundred boxes,"
6305,BOOK VI.,For fifty sons and fifty doxies;
6306,BOOK VI.,And not far off a dozen houses
6307,BOOK VI.,"For Priam's daughters and their spouses,"
6308,BOOK VI.,"All finish'd nicely to a charm,"
6309,BOOK VI.,And thatch'd with straw to keep 'em warm.
6310,BOOK VI.,"Whilst Hector thought that no one ey'd him,"
6311,BOOK VI.,The good old Hecuba espy'd him;
6312,BOOK VI.,That pretty wench Laodice
6313,BOOK VI.,Bore the old lady company.
6314,BOOK VI.,"Hip, hip! she cry'd, to make him stand;"
6315,BOOK VI.,Then came and shook him by the hand:
6316,BOOK VI.,
6317,BOOK VI.,What sudden call could bring my son
6318,BOOK VI.,Before the scuffle is half done?
6319,BOOK VI.,"If 'tis the gripes, I have within"
6320,BOOK VI.,A stoop of special Holland's gin.
6321,BOOK VI.,But if thou'rt hither come to pray
6322,BOOK VI.,Our wooden gods to drive away
6323,BOOK VI.,"Those Grecian rogues, and clear our doors"
6324,BOOK VI.,"From all such noisy sons of whores,"
6325,BOOK VI.,Stay till I fetch our pewter cup;
6326,BOOK VI.,You know their godships like a sup:
6327,BOOK VI.,The priests won't tell the reason why;
6328,BOOK VI.,"But 'tis, I think, 'twixt you and I,"
6329,BOOK VI.,Because their rotten wood's so dry.
6330,BOOK VI.,"After you've fill'd their bellies full,"
6331,BOOK VI.,Then take yourself a hearty pull:
6332,BOOK VI.,Our Trojan stingo has the merit
6333,BOOK VI.,"To cheer the heart, and raise the spirit."
6334,BOOK VI.,
6335,BOOK VI.,"Hector replies; Pray keep your beer,"
6336,BOOK VI.,It only serves to make folks swear:
6337,BOOK VI.,"To men it mischief brings, so spare it,"
6338,BOOK VI.,"But give it gods, their heads will bear it;"
6339,BOOK VI.,"Or, if they should get tipsy, they"
6340,BOOK VI.,Have nought to do but snore all day.
6341,BOOK VI.,"But let some else perform that task,"
6342,BOOK VI.,I am not fit a boon to ask:
6343,BOOK VI.,"Whate'er I touch will have no luck,"
6344,BOOK VI.,You see my hands all blood and muck.
6345,BOOK VI.,"But you, old souls, without delay,"
6346,BOOK VI.,Must to that brim Minerva pray:
6347,BOOK VI.,And mind you spread upon her knee
6348,BOOK VI.,The richest satin negligee
6349,BOOK VI.,That you have got in all your store;
6350,BOOK VI.,"If finely daub'd with tinsel o'er,"
6351,BOOK VI.,"'Twill stand the better chance to please her,"
6352,BOOK VI.,And may by great good luck appease her.
6353,BOOK VI.,"When she has listen'd to your vows,"
6354,BOOK VI.,We'll add a dozen virgin cows.
6355,BOOK VI.,"If she don't like so good a dinner,"
6356,BOOK VI.,"As many devils must be in her,"
6357,BOOK VI.,"As, we are told by parson Diggs,"
6358,BOOK VI.,Once popp'd into a drove of pigs.
6359,BOOK VI.,"But mind you bargain in your prayer,"
6360,BOOK VI.,"That she'll our Trojan cuckolds spare,"
6361,BOOK VI.,Nor longer suffer Diomede
6362,BOOK VI.,To make their pates and noses bleed.
6363,BOOK VI.,"This task I leave to you, good mother,"
6364,BOOK VI.,"Whilst I go rouse my hopeful brother,"
6365,BOOK VI.,"And try if, deaf to honour's name,"
6366,BOOK VI.,The whoring rogue has lost all shame.
6367,BOOK VI.,"I wish the whelp was under ground,"
6368,BOOK VI.,So deep he never could be found;
6369,BOOK VI.,"Myself would, if it was not treason,"
6370,BOOK VI.,Hang up a dog so lost to reason.
6371,BOOK VI.,"This war, that threats us all with ruin,"
6372,BOOK VI.,Is mischief of that rascal's brewing:
6373,BOOK VI.,"We never had this mischief felt,"
6374,BOOK VI.,Had he ten years ago been gelt.
6375,BOOK VI.,
6376,BOOK VI.,He spoke: his mother summon'd all
6377,BOOK VI.,"The good old women, short and tall."
6378,BOOK VI.,"Away they to the wardrobe go,"
6379,BOOK VI.,"Which, open'd, made a tearing show,"
6380,BOOK VI.,"To find the very things they sought,"
6381,BOOK VI.,That Paris from Sidonia brought;
6382,BOOK VI.,"For Paris chose to touch at Sidon,"
6383,BOOK VI.,To get some shoes and stockings try'd on
6384,BOOK VI.,"For his dear Nelly, who had scarce"
6385,BOOK VI.,An undam'd smicket to her a--
6386,BOOK VI.,When first they stole away from Greece;
6387,BOOK VI.,"But that's no matter, such a piece"
6388,BOOK VI.,"A man of any soul might brag on,"
6389,BOOK VI.,Although her bum had ne'er a rag on.
6390,BOOK VI.,"Old Hec.[2] her spectacles lugg'd out,"
6391,BOOK VI.,"To help her eyes to peep about,"
6392,BOOK VI.,"And, looking sharp, she quickly sees"
6393,BOOK VI.,Above a dozen negligees
6394,BOOK VI.,Hung up on pegs; so pitch'd on one
6395,BOOK VI.,That had a deal of tinsel on.
6396,BOOK VI.,"Then foll'wing old Antenor's spouse,"
6397,BOOK VI.,They reach'd the door o' th' meeting-house.
6398,BOOK VI.,Theano carried in her pocket
6399,BOOK VI.,"The only key that would unlock it,"
6400,BOOK VI.,"Which out she lugg'd, and with a bang"
6401,BOOK VI.,Made the old rusty lock cry twang.
6402,BOOK VI.,
6403,BOOK VI.,"When they were all got in together,"
6404,BOOK VI.,They roar'd like pigs in windy weather:
6405,BOOK VI.,"The priestess spread the gown, and then"
6406,BOOK VI.,Pray'd loud; th' old women bawl'd Amen!
6407,BOOK VI.,
6408,BOOK VI.,"[Illustration: Book VI, page 338."
6409,BOOK VI.,"When they were all got in together,"
6410,BOOK VI.,They roar'd like pigs in windy weather.
6411,BOOK VI.,"The priestess spread the gown, and then"
6412,BOOK VI.,Pray'd loud; th' old women bawl'd Amen.]
6413,BOOK VI.,
6414,BOOK VI.,"Once Troy's defence, O goddess stout!"
6415,BOOK VI.,Only with patience hear us out:
6416,BOOK VI.,"Let us this rogue Tydides humble,"
6417,BOOK VI.,And make him either run or tumble.
6418,BOOK VI.,"If this, O Pallas! you'll but do,"
6419,BOOK VI.,Twelve rare fat heifers we'll bestow
6420,BOOK VI.,"Upon you, if you hear our prayer,"
6421,BOOK VI.,And all our Trojan cuckolds spare.
6422,BOOK VI.,
6423,BOOK VI.,"Thus the old women pray and vow,"
6424,BOOK VI.,And make a noise; but 'twould not do.
6425,BOOK VI.,"Whilst they say prayers not worth a louse,"
6426,BOOK VI.,Hector had travel'd to the house
6427,BOOK VI.,Where Paris dwelt along with Helen--
6428,BOOK VI.,"A very pretty little dwelling,"
6429,BOOK VI.,That join'd his father and his brother--
6430,BOOK VI.,So they were neighbours to each other:
6431,BOOK VI.,This little mansion Paris' self
6432,BOOK VI.,"Contriv'd, both window, door, and shelf."
6433,BOOK VI.,The Trojan chief had got a strong
6434,BOOK VI.,"Oak sapling, eight or ten feet long,"
6435,BOOK VI.,"Hung with brass rings to make it rattle,"
6436,BOOK VI.,And scare the enemy in battle:
6437,BOOK VI.,"He knock'd, and scrap'd his shoes from dirt;"
6438,BOOK VI.,"Then ent'ring, found him in his shirt"
6439,BOOK VI.,"He'd stripp'd himself, the better to"
6440,BOOK VI.,Polish his skull-cap and his bow.
6441,BOOK VI.,"In this condition Hector found him,"
6442,BOOK VI.,With twenty broomsticks scatter'd round him.
6443,BOOK VI.,"Helen was standing by his knee,"
6444,BOOK VI.,Scolding her maids for drinking tea;
6445,BOOK VI.,"For though for breakfast she ne'er grudg'd it,"
6446,BOOK VI.,Yet in the afternoon they fudg'd it.
6447,BOOK VI.,
6448,BOOK VI.,
6449,BOOK VI.,"[Illustration: Book VI, page 340."
6450,BOOK VI.,
6451,BOOK VI.,
6452,BOOK VI.,"He knock'd a dozen times or more,"
6453,BOOK VI.,Then bump'd his rump against the door
6454,BOOK VI.,"'Twas bolted with a wooden pin,"
6455,BOOK VI.,"Which broke, and down he tumbled in.]"
6456,BOOK VI.,
6457,BOOK VI.,
6458,BOOK VI.,"When Hector saw him in this pickle,"
6459,BOOK VI.,"No wonder he began to stickle,"
6460,BOOK VI.,And thus began: By this good light!
6461,BOOK VI.,You've nick'd the time to show your spite
6462,BOOK VI.,Against poor Troy. Dost thou conspire
6463,BOOK VI.,With Greece to set our barns on fire?
6464,BOOK VI.,"For thee our bloods all fight and tumble,"
6465,BOOK VI.,"And kick and cuff, yet never grumble;"
6466,BOOK VI.,"Till nothing's left to guard the gates,"
6467,BOOK VI.,But heaps of bruis'd and broken pates.
6468,BOOK VI.,"You whoring rascal, come along,"
6469,BOOK VI.,And bear a bob amidst the throng;
6470,BOOK VI.,Why can't you run the risk of scars
6471,BOOK VI.,"In Mars' as well as Venus' wars,"
6472,BOOK VI.,"Ere flames attack our huts and tow'rs,"
6473,BOOK VI.,And burn your dogship out of doors?
6474,BOOK VI.,
6475,BOOK VI.,"Paris, who was a gentle youth,"
6476,BOOK VI.,"Says, Brother, this is all God's truth:"
6477,BOOK VI.,"Yet don't mistake me, mighty Sir;"
6478,BOOK VI.,Nor on my honour cast a slur.
6479,BOOK VI.,"I'm sorry you're so hard put to't,"
6480,BOOK VI.,And think I dare not box it out:
6481,BOOK VI.,"But say no more, no more let's prattle,"
6482,BOOK VI.,Helen commands me out to battle.
6483,BOOK VI.,"Who knows but Menelaus may,"
6484,BOOK VI.,"On this, or hap some other day,"
6485,BOOK VI.,"Get, though he makes such fuss and stir,"
6486,BOOK VI.,A Rowland for his Oliver?
6487,BOOK VI.,"One thing I'll promise, the next bout"
6488,BOOK VI.,I'll boldly try if I can do't.
6489,BOOK VI.,"But whilst I don my coat and cap,"
6490,BOOK VI.,Do you sit still or take a nap;
6491,BOOK VI.,"But if you go, you may be sure"
6492,BOOK VI.,I'll follow you in half an hour.
6493,BOOK VI.,
6494,BOOK VI.,"Nelly, who had, you need not doubt her,"
6495,BOOK VI.,"Like other wives, her wits about her,"
6496,BOOK VI.,To hinder Hector from replying
6497,BOOK VI.,Began a sudden fit of crying.
6498,BOOK VI.,"Hector, who thought his stick had hit her,"
6499,BOOK VI.,"Or else that Pug or Shock had bit her,"
6500,BOOK VI.,"Whipp'd round about to ask the matter,"
6501,BOOK VI.,When thus the jade began to chatter:
6502,BOOK VI.,"Now let me tell you, brother Hector,"
6503,BOOK VI.,No living mortal can conjecture
6504,BOOK VI.,"The grief I suffer, 'cause I hide it,"
6505,BOOK VI.,But I no longer will abide it;
6506,BOOK VI.,"There's nothing else, I find, but speaking,"
6507,BOOK VI.,Can keep a woman's heart from breaking:
6508,BOOK VI.,"I wish they'd in a horse-pond duck'd me,"
6509,BOOK VI.,"To cool my courage, ere they tuck'd me"
6510,BOOK VI.,Up in the bed where Paris ---- ----!
6511,BOOK VI.,"I wish, before this cursed strife,"
6512,BOOK VI.,"By the small-pox I'd lost my life,"
6513,BOOK VI.,Or that my nose was full of pimples
6514,BOOK VI.,As that old canting rogue D---l---'s:
6515,BOOK VI.,I wish to God we'd both been drown'd
6516,BOOK VI.,When first we cross'd the herring-pond!
6517,BOOK VI.,"But I may wish and make a pother,"
6518,BOOK VI.,"Wish in one hand, and spit in t'other."
6519,BOOK VI.,"My cursed luck I e'er shall rue,"
6520,BOOK VI.,But most since Paris first I knew.
6521,BOOK VI.,"Women the worst will always choose,"
6522,BOOK VI.,Else I had got a better spouse;
6523,BOOK VI.,"I only mean a better fighter,"
6524,BOOK VI.,A buck that might have cudgell'd tighter
6525,BOOK VI.,"For other work, there's not a man"
6526,BOOK VI.,Can do a third that Paris can:
6527,BOOK VI.,I scorn to speak but what is true;
6528,BOOK VI.,The devil ought to have his due.
6529,BOOK VI.,"But sit you down, and rest a while,"
6530,BOOK VI.,"You've had a mortal deal of toil,"
6531,BOOK VI.,"Enough to make a man quite mad,"
6532,BOOK VI.,For me and my faint-hearted lad.
6533,BOOK VI.,"It can't be help'd, I know my doom,"
6534,BOOK VI.,And judge by past of what's to come.
6535,BOOK VI.,"Our woes will gain us future pity,"
6536,BOOK VI.,"And fill some lamentable ditty,"
6537,BOOK VI.,"Which hard-mouth'd raggamuffins will,"
6538,BOOK VI.,"From Charing-Cross to Ludgate-Hill,"
6539,BOOK VI.,"Roar with a voice as sweet and clear,"
6540,BOOK VI.,As Tyburn dying-speeches are.
6541,BOOK VI.,
6542,BOOK VI.,Hector replies: Another day
6543,BOOK VI.,"I'll chat awhile, but now can't stay,"
6544,BOOK VI.,"Because our men are sore put to't,"
6545,BOOK VI.,And want my fist to help 'em out:
6546,BOOK VI.,But I must beg you'll not be slack
6547,BOOK VI.,To stroke your swain upon his back;
6548,BOOK VI.,"No wench can do unless she tries,"
6549,BOOK VI.,Your hand may make his--courage rise:
6550,BOOK VI.,"When that is done, dispatch him soon,"
6551,BOOK VI.,"But do not take that courage down,"
6552,BOOK VI.,"Nor stay him with your coaxing prate,"
6553,BOOK VI.,But let him meet me at the gate.
6554,BOOK VI.,"I go to see my son and wife,"
6555,BOOK VI.,The joy and comfort of my life:
6556,BOOK VI.,For who can tell if Hector may
6557,BOOK VI.,Have luck to box another day?
6558,BOOK VI.,"Some witch, that chooses to annoy him,"
6559,BOOK VI.,May guide a broomstaff to destroy him.
6560,BOOK VI.,
6561,BOOK VI.,"He said no more, but turn'd about"
6562,BOOK VI.,To go and find his helpmate out.
6563,BOOK VI.,"When he came home she was not there,"
6564,BOOK VI.,Nor could he find her far or near.
6565,BOOK VI.,"She and her son, and maid, and all,"
6566,BOOK VI.,Were got upon an orchard-wall;
6567,BOOK VI.,"There saw the rabble bruise and cut,"
6568,BOOK VI.,Until it almost grip'd her gut:
6569,BOOK VI.,Still she kept looking sharp about
6570,BOOK VI.,"To find her good-man Hector out,"
6571,BOOK VI.,Whilst he through twenty alleys stumbled
6572,BOOK VI.,And all the while his gizzard grumbled;
6573,BOOK VI.,"Then sought the postern, with intent"
6574,BOOK VI.,To ask the guard which way she went.
6575,BOOK VI.,"Halloo, my lads, did any see"
6576,BOOK VI.,My loving wife Andromache?
6577,BOOK VI.,"Or did she land at Temple-stairs,"
6578,BOOK VI.,To join th' old women in their prayers?
6579,BOOK VI.,"Or, all this time that I have miss'd her,"
6580,BOOK VI.,Think you she's gone to see her sister?
6581,BOOK VI.,
6582,BOOK VI.,"She's not at church, replies the sentry,"
6583,BOOK VI.,Clubbing her prayers with these old gentry
6584,BOOK VI.,"Nor is she gone to Priam's hall,"
6585,BOOK VI.,"But stands, d'ye see, on yonder wall."
6586,BOOK VI.,"She heard how fast the Trojans ran,"
6587,BOOK VI.,And sweated for her own good-man.
6588,BOOK VI.,"I help'd her o'er this stile to get,"
6589,BOOK VI.,And felt her hands; they both were wet
6590,BOOK VI.,"As muck, and in a clammy sweat:"
6591,BOOK VI.,"Her haste was such, that, I can say,"
6592,BOOK VI.,She trotted ev'ry inch o' th' way:
6593,BOOK VI.,"I'll answer for't, before she got"
6594,BOOK VI.,"To th' wall, her bum was smoking hot:"
6595,BOOK VI.,"And then, as fast as she could waddle,"
6596,BOOK VI.,The nurse did with the bantling straddle.
6597,BOOK VI.,
6598,BOOK VI.,To this bold Hector did not say
6599,BOOK VI.,"A single word, but walk'd away,"
6600,BOOK VI.,"Not caring to lose time in prate,"
6601,BOOK VI.,And met his wife at Cripplegate.
6602,BOOK VI.,His wife was always understood
6603,BOOK VI.,To be what moderns call good blood;
6604,BOOK VI.,"Her mother had been lady mayoress,"
6605,BOOK VI.,And she herself a vast rich heiress.
6606,BOOK VI.,"Soon as she did her husband spy,"
6607,BOOK VI.,She gave a spring a quarter high;
6608,BOOK VI.,"The nurse then follow'd with the lad,"
6609,BOOK VI.,"That scratch'd, and roar'd, and kick'd, like mad."
6610,BOOK VI.,Great Hector often had been trying
6611,BOOK VI.,To cure the cross-grain'd brat from crying;
6612,BOOK VI.,But could not do't--so call'd his name
6613,BOOK VI.,"Scamandrius, from a running stream:"
6614,BOOK VI.,"But thinking that queer name would gall him,"
6615,BOOK VI.,Astyanax the Trojans call him.
6616,BOOK VI.,Hector was in his heart right glad
6617,BOOK VI.,To see the sprawling scrambling lad;
6618,BOOK VI.,But with a very doleful look
6619,BOOK VI.,"His partner seiz'd his fist and spoke,"
6620,BOOK VI.,Whilst you might see within her eye
6621,BOOK VI.,The tears stood ready cock'd to cry:
6622,BOOK VI.,
6623,BOOK VI.,"Why sure you cannot think, my life,"
6624,BOOK VI.,To leave your only son and wife?
6625,BOOK VI.,"How great, alas! must be my fall,"
6626,BOOK VI.,Should you get drubb'd for good and all!
6627,BOOK VI.,"I know, my duckling, though your laugh,"
6628,BOOK VI.,You're too courageous by half:
6629,BOOK VI.,"With single bullies you can pull,"
6630,BOOK VI.,But many dogs will beat a bull;
6631,BOOK VI.,"And ev'ry Grecian cur, I see,"
6632,BOOK VI.,Will strive to get a bite at thee.
6633,BOOK VI.,If therefore my poor Hector must
6634,BOOK VI.,"Be drubb'd, and tumbled in the dust,"
6635,BOOK VI.,"God send, before that woeful day,"
6636,BOOK VI.,"That thy poor dearee safely may,"
6637,BOOK VI.,"Rather than hear their gibes and scoffing,"
6638,BOOK VI.,Be nail'd up in a strong elm coffin!
6639,BOOK VI.,"Where is the man, if thou should'st fail,"
6640,BOOK VI.,Would buy thy wife a pot of ale?
6641,BOOK VI.,I've neither father left nor mother;
6642,BOOK VI.,"Nor loving uncle, aunt, or brother."
6643,BOOK VI.,"At Thebes Achilles burnt us out,"
6644,BOOK VI.,And kill'd my fighting dad to boot:
6645,BOOK VI.,"But when he had the good man slain,"
6646,BOOK VI.,"With pity he was overta'en,"
6647,BOOK VI.,"Made a most mighty fuss and racket,"
6648,BOOK VI.,And burnt the body in its jacket;
6649,BOOK VI.,"Then rais'd a mountain o'er his bones,"
6650,BOOK VI.,"Of mud and clay, and sand, and stones."
6651,BOOK VI.,"It happen'd where some fairies haunted,"
6652,BOOK VI.,And they the place with elm-trees planted.
6653,BOOK VI.,At the same time seven loving brothers
6654,BOOK VI.,This damn'd infernal rascal smothers;
6655,BOOK VI.,"Quite unawares the lads he snaps,"
6656,BOOK VI.,As they for mice were setting traps:
6657,BOOK VI.,"Then took my mother prisoner,"
6658,BOOK VI.,And sent her to the Lord knows where;
6659,BOOK VI.,"Though soon, because she was not handsome,"
6660,BOOK VI.,"He let her go, but kept the ransom."
6661,BOOK VI.,"To her own house they'd hardly got her,"
6662,BOOK VI.,"Before that brim, Diana, shot her:"
6663,BOOK VI.,"But though I am of them bereft,"
6664,BOOK VI.,I'd snuff the moon if thou art left;
6665,BOOK VI.,"But if my bully-rock should fall,"
6666,BOOK VI.,"They're lost again, not one, but all."
6667,BOOK VI.,"For sake of me and this brave boy,"
6668,BOOK VI.,Keep snug within the walls of Troy:
6669,BOOK VI.,I'll tell thee where the whore's-birds make
6670,BOOK VI.,Their strongest push the town to take;
6671,BOOK VI.,Do but observe their ragged bands
6672,BOOK VI.,All muster where yond' fig-tree stands;
6673,BOOK VI.,"There let thy trusty broomshaft fly,"
6674,BOOK VI.,And smite the scoundrels hip and thigh.
6675,BOOK VI.,
6676,BOOK VI.,"Not that alone, the chief reply'd,"
6677,BOOK VI.,"Shall be my care, there's more beside;"
6678,BOOK VI.,"I've many sturdy jobs to do,"
6679,BOOK VI.,Which I shall buckle tightly to.
6680,BOOK VI.,"Should I hang back, you'd quickly see"
6681,BOOK VI.,"The Trojans making game of me,"
6682,BOOK VI.,"And madams, with their sweeping tails,"
6683,BOOK VI.,Seem much surpris'd what Hector ails.
6684,BOOK VI.,"Then, at the next tea-table lecture,"
6685,BOOK VI.,"Cry, 'Bless us! what is come to Hector?"
6686,BOOK VI.,"He us'd to maul these Grecian scrubs,"
6687,BOOK VI.,But now he's got the mullygrubs.'
6688,BOOK VI.,When broils begin I never fail:
6689,BOOK VI.,Fighting to me is cakes and ale.
6690,BOOK VI.,At school I practis'd ev'ry day
6691,BOOK VI.,Both quarter-staff and cudgel-play;
6692,BOOK VI.,"And I'll be first, you may depend,"
6693,BOOK VI.,Our beef and pudding to defend.
6694,BOOK VI.,"And yet that cursed day will come,"
6695,BOOK VI.,"I know by th' pricking of my thumb,"
6696,BOOK VI.,When Troy shall tumble in a ruin
6697,BOOK VI.,Of that damn'd brimstone Juno's brewing:
6698,BOOK VI.,Though all my loving cousins dying
6699,BOOK VI.,"Won't set me half so soon a crying,"
6700,BOOK VI.,As what I inwardly foresee
6701,BOOK VI.,Will happen to Andromache.
6702,BOOK VI.,"They'll make my rib a water-heaver,"
6703,BOOK VI.,Or put her 'prentice to a weaver;
6704,BOOK VI.,"And then, for fear so great a tumble"
6705,BOOK VI.,"Should fail to make her gizzard grumble,"
6706,BOOK VI.,"Some scoundrel Grecian, to deject her,"
6707,BOOK VI.,"Will whisper, That's the wife of Hector;"
6708,BOOK VI.,As if they could not plague poor thee
6709,BOOK VI.,"Enough, without rememb'ring me."
6710,BOOK VI.,"But let them, if they plague thee long,"
6711,BOOK VI.,Once feel the rough side of thy tongue:
6712,BOOK VI.,And if again they ever strive
6713,BOOK VI.,"To vex thee, I'll be flay'd alive!"
6714,BOOK VI.,"All that I wish is, that I may"
6715,BOOK VI.,"Be six foot under ground that day,"
6716,BOOK VI.,"Where I shall neither, when I'm cold,"
6717,BOOK VI.,"Hear my wife sigh, or cry, or scold."
6718,BOOK VI.,
6719,BOOK VI.,"This said, the bully-back of Troy"
6720,BOOK VI.,Stretch'd out his arms to take the boy;
6721,BOOK VI.,"The lad hung back, and durst not touch"
6722,BOOK VI.,His brazen hat for e'er so much.
6723,BOOK VI.,"Pleas'd, he laid down his glitt'ring hat,"
6724,BOOK VI.,Which quieted the brawling brat;
6725,BOOK VI.,"Then lifts him high into the air,"
6726,BOOK VI.,And prays a special country prayer:
6727,BOOK VI.,
6728,BOOK VI.,"O Jupiter! brimful of glory,"
6729,BOOK VI.,"Who dwells in heaven's upper story,"
6730,BOOK VI.,"Protect this lad, and grant that he"
6731,BOOK VI.,The wonder of the world may be;
6732,BOOK VI.,And at the sport in which I prided
6733,BOOK VI.,May break more heads than ever I did;
6734,BOOK VI.,"That when he lays his twenties flat,"
6735,BOOK VI.,"And brings away the gold-lac'd hat,"
6736,BOOK VI.,"The people all may say, This lad"
6737,BOOK VI.,At cudgel-playing beats his dad:
6738,BOOK VI.,And when they shout and praise the boy.
6739,BOOK VI.,The mam. bep---- herself for joy!
6740,BOOK VI.,"He spoke, and smiling look'd upon her,"
6741,BOOK VI.,Then laid the hopeful bantling on her.
6742,BOOK VI.,"She hugg'd him closely to her breast,"
6743,BOOK VI.,And sung him lullaby to rest:
6744,BOOK VI.,"Though fear possess'd her soul so strong,"
6745,BOOK VI.,She made a sort of crying song.
6746,BOOK VI.,"This Hector view'd with feeling eye,"
6747,BOOK VI.,(He hated much to see her cry)
6748,BOOK VI.,"And though he seem'd to look more grum for't,"
6749,BOOK VI.,He spoke these words to give her comfort:
6750,BOOK VI.,
6751,BOOK VI.,"No man, unless it is his fate"
6752,BOOK VI.,"To do't, can break thy Hector's pate;"
6753,BOOK VI.,"And this be sure, no mortal man"
6754,BOOK VI.,Can live much longer than he can;
6755,BOOK VI.,"When raw-bon'd Death once takes the field,"
6756,BOOK VI.,He makes both mayors and sheriffs yield;
6757,BOOK VI.,And in the devil's lock secures
6758,BOOK VI.,"Your reformation-rogues by scores,"
6759,BOOK VI.,For plaguing wretched helpless whores:
6760,BOOK VI.,"Then cease, my jewel, get you in"
6761,BOOK VI.,"To knit, or darn, or stitch, or spin."
6762,BOOK VI.,"For me, it ever is my lot"
6763,BOOK VI.,To be where broken pates are got:
6764,BOOK VI.,"The man that's always first at eating,"
6765,BOOK VI.,Should be the first to risk a beating.
6766,BOOK VI.,
6767,BOOK VI.,"This said, he takes his skullcap up,"
6768,BOOK VI.,With goose-quills shaded at the top:
6769,BOOK VI.,"Homeward his dearee ply'd her stumps,"
6770,BOOK VI.,And sat her down in doleful dumps;
6771,BOOK VI.,"Where, as she made her grievous moan,"
6772,BOOK VI.,"The pigs return'd her grunt for groan,"
6773,BOOK VI.,And both the cook and chambermaid
6774,BOOK VI.,Blubber'd as if their lord was dead.
6775,BOOK VI.,
6776,BOOK VI.,"And now bold Paris sally'd out,"
6777,BOOK VI.,Prepar'd to take the other bout;
6778,BOOK VI.,"In a bright cap you see him tow'ring,"
6779,BOOK VI.,The same that Hector caught him scouring.
6780,BOOK VI.,Thus when a Cheapside cockney's tit
6781,BOOK VI.,"From his long back has thrown the cit,"
6782,BOOK VI.,"Well pleas'd to leave his leaden load,"
6783,BOOK VI.,"He kicks and flings along the road,"
6784,BOOK VI.,"Splashes foot people as he goes,"
6785,BOOK VI.,And daubs with mud their Sunday's clothes.
6786,BOOK VI.,Just so brisk Paris skipp'd about.
6787,BOOK VI.,Resolv'd to buckle tightly to't;
6788,BOOK VI.,"Then joining Hector's jobbernoul,"
6789,BOOK VI.,Away they trotted cheek-by-joul:
6790,BOOK VI.,
6791,BOOK VI.,"When Paris first began to say,"
6792,BOOK VI.,"Brother, you must excuse my stay,"
6793,BOOK VI.,I could not sooner get away.
6794,BOOK VI.,"I stay'd, if I the truth must tell ye,"
6795,BOOK VI.,"To do a little job for Nelly,"
6796,BOOK VI.,Which hinder'd me 'bout half an hour:
6797,BOOK VI.,It could not be a great deal more:
6798,BOOK VI.,But the poor honest loving heart
6799,BOOK VI.,With dry lips always hates to part;
6800,BOOK VI.,I therefore think I'm bound in honour
6801,BOOK VI.,To spend what I can spare upon her.
6802,BOOK VI.,
6803,BOOK VI.,"Brother, says Hector, let what's past"
6804,BOOK VI.,"Be quite forgot; you're come at last,"
6805,BOOK VI.,And that's enough. Thou art in blood
6806,BOOK VI.,"My brother, make that kinship good:"
6807,BOOK VI.,"In broils let's second one another,"
6808,BOOK VI.,And then I'll own thee for a brother:
6809,BOOK VI.,"That you dare fight was never doubted,"
6810,BOOK VI.,Nor was your mettle e'er disputed;
6811,BOOK VI.,But Troy makes such a cursed roaring
6812,BOOK VI.,"About your idleness and whoring,"
6813,BOOK VI.,"That, did you hear each prating elf,"
6814,BOOK VI.,'Twould make you almost hang yourself.
6815,BOOK VI.,Some pains I'd therefore have you take;
6816,BOOK VI.,They've box'd it stoutly for your sake:
6817,BOOK VI.,'Twould please me much to hear 'em telling
6818,BOOK VI.,"You sweat the Greeks as well as Helen,"
6819,BOOK VI.,"And are prepar'd to storm a trench,"
6820,BOOK VI.,"Or storm the quarters of a wench,"
6821,BOOK VI.,Just as it suits--Such men as these
6822,BOOK VI.,Are sure all sorts of folks to please.
6823,BOOK VI.,But cheer thee up; our toils shall cease
6824,BOOK VI.,When Pitt's employ'd to make a peace:
6825,BOOK VI.,"Then Grecian rogues, with grief and shame,"
6826,BOOK VI.,Shall trundle back from whence they came.

6962,BOOK VII.,Resolv'd to give the Greeks a dose.
6963,BOOK VII.,"As when poor sailors, tir'd with towing,"

6980,BOOK VII.,"And get this boy; but though he thrash'd hard,"
6981,BOOK VII.,The urchin proved a graceless bastard.
6982,BOOK VII.,
6983,BOOK VII.,Then with a most confounded whack
6984,BOOK VII.,Eioneus tumbled on his back;
6985,BOOK VII.,"An inch below his cap of steel,"

7016,BOOK VII.,A recipe they could not make
7017,BOOK VII.,To cure your lay'ship's belly-ache:
7018,BOOK VII.,But had the great-wigg'd varlets thought on
7019,BOOK VII.,"The famous drops of Doctor Stoughton,"
7020,BOOK VII.,That would have done't: they eas'd my tripes
7021,BOOK VII.,When all on snicksnarls with the gripes;
7022,BOOK VII.,"And you'll experience, if you try,"
7023,BOOK VII.,They cure the gripes both wet and dry.
7024,BOOK VII.,I therefore for the belly-ache
7025,BOOK VII.,"No other medicine will take,"

7036,BOOK VII.,For who can stand against the whims
7037,BOOK VII.,Of two such d----d revengeful brims?
7038,BOOK VII.,
7039,BOOK VII.,When thus replies the scratching bitch:
7040,BOOK VII.,"Split me, if you ar'n't grown a witch!"

7053,BOOK VII.,
7054,BOOK VII.,"To her, when she had done her prate,"
7055,BOOK VII.,Replies the god with carrot pate.
7056,BOOK VII.,"I know a scheme will do the job,"
7057,BOOK VII.,If you'll consent to bear a bob.
7058,BOOK VII.,"That, says the fighting jade, I'll do,"
7059,BOOK VII.,Though it should prove a bob or two.
7060,BOOK VII.,"Then, says the god, do you begin"
7061,BOOK VII.,Directly now to put it in--
7062,BOOK VII.,"Put what, ye hedgehog? says the jade."
7063,BOOK VII.,"Why, put it into Hector's head"
7064,BOOK VII.,To ride amongst the Grecian band
7065,BOOK VII.,"With an old backsword in his hand,"
7066,BOOK VII.,Then with a flourish challenge out
7067,BOOK VII.,The boldest bruiser to a bout
7068,BOOK VII.,"At quarter-staff or cudgel play,"
7069,BOOK VII.,"Or flats or sharps, or any way,"
7070,BOOK VII.,"Till Greece, desirous to abase him,"
7071,BOOK VII.,Shall find some thick-skull'd knave to face him.
7072,BOOK VII.,
7073,BOOK VII.,"They then shook hands, their faith to pledge,"
7074,BOOK VII.,Then squatted down behind a hedge.
7075,BOOK VII.,"The moment that they disappear'd,"
7076,BOOK VII.,"Helenus, who their chat o'erheard,"
7077,BOOK VII.,"The breast of valiant Hector fir'd,"
7078,BOOK VII.,By telling him he was inspir'd.
7079,BOOK VII.,
7080,BOOK VII.,"Hector, says he, I dare defy"
7081,BOOK VII.,"The crying prophet, Jeremy,"
7082,BOOK VII.,To tell more gospel truth than I:
7083,BOOK VII.,"That no more rogues to-day may drop,"
7084,BOOK VII.,Go you and all your shabroons stop;
7085,BOOK VII.,"Then challenge, though the Greeks should stare,"
7086,BOOK VII.,Their best backsword or cudgel-player.
7087,BOOK VII.,"Away, and do not stay to grumble,"
7088,BOOK VII.,For be assur'd in this day's rumble
7089,BOOK VII.,The devil will not let you tumble.
7090,BOOK VII.,
7091,BOOK VII.,"He said, and Hector rais'd his mop's"
7092,BOOK VII.,"Long shaft, and all the Trojans stops:"
7093,BOOK VII.,On this the Grecian chief commands
7094,BOOK VII.,His squabbling knaves to hold their hands.
7095,BOOK VII.,
7096,BOOK VII.,Apollo and the fighting lass
7097,BOOK VII.,Chuckled to find their scheme take place;
7098,BOOK VII.,"Like owls in ivy-trees they sat,"
7099,BOOK VII.,To see which broke the other's pate.
7100,BOOK VII.,"The common rogues, as well they might,"
7101,BOOK VII.,Were glad to let their leaders fight:
7102,BOOK VII.,'Twould please you much to see how soon
7103,BOOK VII.,"The rabble threw their broomstaffs down,"
7104,BOOK VII.,"Then, with a clumpish kind of sound,"
7105,BOOK VII.,Bang went their buttocks on the ground.
7106,BOOK VII.,"As when a darkness spreads the streets,"
7107,BOOK VII.,"One drunkard with another meets,"
7108,BOOK VII.,"They roll, and mighty pother keep,"
7109,BOOK VII.,Till both i' th' kennel fall asleep--
7110,BOOK VII.,Thus by degrees these sons of Mars's
7111,BOOK VII.,"Settle themselves upon their a---s,"
7112,BOOK VII.,"When Hector, with a thund'ring speech,"
7113,BOOK VII.,Made half the Greeks bedaub their breech.
7114,BOOK VII.,
7115,BOOK VII.,"Ye Grecian bulls, and Trojan bears,"
7116,BOOK VII.,"Attend, and prick up all your ears;"
7117,BOOK VII.,"Great Jove's resolved, to plague us all,"
7118,BOOK VII.,"That broils shall rise, and stocks shall fall,"
7119,BOOK VII.,"So orders war to rage anew,"
7120,BOOK VII.,"Till you burn us, or we burn you:"
7121,BOOK VII.,"Better to end it soon than late,"
7122,BOOK VII.,Or make a peace <i>inadequate</i>:
7123,BOOK VII.,Therefore with both your ears attend;
7124,BOOK VII.,'Tis Hector counsels as a friend:
7125,BOOK VII.,"To hinder, ere the day-light closes,"
7126,BOOK VII.,"More bloody pates and broken noses,"
7127,BOOK VII.,"Find out a Broughton or a Slack,"
7128,BOOK VII.,That dares my knotty pate attack:
7129,BOOK VII.,"If I should fall in this dispute,"
7130,BOOK VII.,"Or get my teeth or eyes knock'd out,"
7131,BOOK VII.,"Without the least demur or racket,"
7132,BOOK VII.,"O' god's name let him have my jacket,"
7133,BOOK VII.,And all my cash; my carcass though
7134,BOOK VII.,"Amongst my friends to Troy must go,"
7135,BOOK VII.,There to be burnt; and whilst 'tis frying
7136,BOOK VII.,They'll make a concert up of crying:
7137,BOOK VII.,"But if, by Phœbus' aid, my thrust"
7138,BOOK VII.,"Shall lay your Buckhurst in the dust,"
7139,BOOK VII.,I'll give his jacket to Apollo
7140,BOOK VII.,For helping me to beat him hollow;
7141,BOOK VII.,"His batter'd carcass I will save,"
7142,BOOK VII.,For which his friends may dig a grave
7143,BOOK VII.,"On the sea-shore, and o'er his bones"
7144,BOOK VII.,"Lay one of Carr's black marble stones,"
7145,BOOK VII.,"Which when some honest tar shall see,"
7146,BOOK VII.,"As he returns from smuggling tea,"
7147,BOOK VII.,Thus to himself poor Jack will cry
7148,BOOK VII.,"(Belching a soft Geneva sigh),"
7149,BOOK VII.,"Here lies, beneath this stone so polish'd,"
7150,BOOK VII.,"A Greek, by Hector's staff demolish'd;"
7151,BOOK VII.,The stone acquaints us with the deed;
7152,BOOK VII.,I'd tell his name if I could read.
7153,BOOK VII.,
7154,BOOK VII.,"This speech so scar'd the Grecian prigs,"
7155,BOOK VII.,They star'd about 'em like stuck pigs:
7156,BOOK VII.,"When Menelau, of all the throng,"
7157,BOOK VII.,First found his feet and then his tongue;
7158,BOOK VII.,"For, jumping up from off his breech,"
7159,BOOK VII.,He sputter'd out this furious speech:
7160,BOOK VII.,
7161,BOOK VII.,"Ye men of Greece, why all this trimming"
7162,BOOK VII.,"Nay hold, I mean ye Grecian women!"
7163,BOOK VII.,What shame! when half the world shall hear
7164,BOOK VII.,"Ye all bepiss'd yourselves for fear,"
7165,BOOK VII.,That Greece had not one bold protector
7166,BOOK VII.,"Durst face this bullying scrub, this Hector!"
7167,BOOK VII.,"But I will fight him, you shall see,"
7168,BOOK VII.,Though he's as big again as me;
7169,BOOK VII.,And by that time ye ev'ry one
7170,BOOK VII.,"May change, perhaps, from wood to stone."
7171,BOOK VII.,
7172,BOOK VII.,"This speech of speeches being done,"
7173,BOOK VII.,He whipp'd his greasy buff-coat on;
7174,BOOK VII.,Wrath fill'd him with a strong desire
7175,BOOK VII.,To run his fingers into th' fire.
7176,BOOK VII.,"Had he the fate of battle try'd,"
7177,BOOK VII.,Hector had surely trimm'd his hide;
7178,BOOK VII.,"But all at once both old and young,"
7179,BOOK VII.,"As if by wasps or hornets stung,"
7180,BOOK VII.,"Start up with one consent to speak,"
7181,BOOK VII.,And stop this Bobadillian Greek;
7182,BOOK VII.,Resolv'd they'd not indulge the cub in
7183,BOOK VII.,His great desire to get a drubbing.
7184,BOOK VII.,
7185,BOOK VII.,"Atrides claim'd first turn to speak,"
7186,BOOK VII.,Because he was the leading Greek.
7187,BOOK VII.,"He clench'd his fist, and thus began:"
7188,BOOK VII.,"The devil, sure, is in the man;"
7189,BOOK VII.,Burn my old wig! but you're about
7190,BOOK VII.,A scheme to get your brains knock'd out:
7191,BOOK VII.,"You've no more chance, I'll make't appear,"
7192,BOOK VII.,Than Jackson's mastiff with a bear:
7193,BOOK VII.,"Vex'd though thou art, and ought to be,"
7194,BOOK VII.,Hector's too big a whelp for thee;
7195,BOOK VII.,"Achilles' self, were not his clothes"
7196,BOOK VII.,"So thick they keep him safe from blows,"
7197,BOOK VII.,Would think it far the lesser evil
7198,BOOK VII.,To be oblig'd to box the devil
7199,BOOK VII.,"Stay where you are, or lie in bed,"
7200,BOOK VII.,We'll find a chief with thicker head;
7201,BOOK VII.,Though pleas'd the stoutest on the lawn
7202,BOOK VII.,"Would be to have the battle drawn,"
7203,BOOK VII.,Should he this bully rock engage
7204,BOOK VII.,"On Broughton's, or on any stage."
7205,BOOK VII.,
7206,BOOK VII.,He spoke: and honest Menelau
7207,BOOK VII.,"Was glad at heart he need not go,"
7208,BOOK VII.,"But kept his cheeks upon the puff,"
7209,BOOK VII.,Till they had lugg'd his doublet off:
7210,BOOK VII.,"When the old cock, with froth and slaver,"
7211,BOOK VII.,"Began, as usual, his palaver:"
7212,BOOK VII.,
7213,BOOK VII.,"O sons of Greece, pray what's the matter,"
7214,BOOK VII.,That thus I hear your grinders chatter;
7215,BOOK VII.,And every Greek and Trojan sees
7216,BOOK VII.,Warm water running down your knees?
7217,BOOK VII.,Greece shakes her nob to see how soon
7218,BOOK VII.,One blust'ring Trojan runs you down.
7219,BOOK VII.,"Time was when Peleus heard, with joy,"
7220,BOOK VII.,"How well ye drubb'd these rogues of Troy,"
7221,BOOK VII.,"And thought he ne'er could hear enough,"
7222,BOOK VII.,"How Jack could kick, and Ned could cuff:"
7223,BOOK VII.,"But, Lord! how will th' old fellow fret"
7224,BOOK VII.,To find one Trojan makes ye sweat!
7225,BOOK VII.,"What grievous tears will he let fall,"
7226,BOOK VII.,And wish the d---l had ye all!
7227,BOOK VII.,"O! that the gods, to try my mettle,"
7228,BOOK VII.,"Would boil me in Medea's kettle,"
7229,BOOK VII.,"Then lend me health and strength in plenty,"
7230,BOOK VII.,"Such as I had at five-and-twenty,"
7231,BOOK VII.,"When I broke all th' Arcadian spears,"
7232,BOOK VII.,And made the scoundrels hang their ears!
7233,BOOK VII.,"One Ereuthelion, at that place,"
7234,BOOK VII.,Had bought a rusty iron mace.
7235,BOOK VII.,"O' th' mayor of Hedon, who had got"
7236,BOOK VII.,A new one giv'n him for his vote:
7237,BOOK VII.,"This mace Areithous did handle,"
7238,BOOK VII.,Just as I would a farthing candle;
7239,BOOK VII.,"With this he smash'd the boldest foe,"
7240,BOOK VII.,But scorn'd a broomshaft or a bow.
7241,BOOK VII.,"Yet one Lycurgus came, and soon"
7242,BOOK VII.,With his sharp broomstick fetch'd him down;
7243,BOOK VII.,"He met him in a narrow place,"
7244,BOOK VII.,"Where he'd no room to swing his mace,"
7245,BOOK VII.,"On which, without delay, he puts out"
7246,BOOK VII.,"His broomshaft's point, and pricks his guts out."
7247,BOOK VII.,Down tumbled he in rueful case;
7248,BOOK VII.,Which the conqu'ror seiz'd his mace:
7249,BOOK VII.,"But growing blind, this fighting tup"
7250,BOOK VII.,Thought it was best to give it up
7251,BOOK VII.,"To Ereuthelion, who would break"
7252,BOOK VII.,Above a hundred pates a week.
7253,BOOK VII.,"This he for several weeks had done,"
7254,BOOK VII.,Which made our trainbands sweat and run;
7255,BOOK VII.,"All ran but me, I scorn'd to flinch;"
7256,BOOK VII.,"Though youngest, would not budge an inch."
7257,BOOK VII.,"This man I fought, this son of Mars,"
7258,BOOK VII.,And fetch'd him such a kick o' th' a--
7259,BOOK VII.,"That down he dropp'd; but, when he fell,"
7260,BOOK VII.,"I know you'll stare at what I tell,"
7261,BOOK VII.,"But I'll make oath 'fore justice Baker,"
7262,BOOK VII.,He fairly cover'd half an acre.
7263,BOOK VII.,Were I just now but half as strong;
7264,BOOK VII.,Hector should not stand hect'ring long.
7265,BOOK VII.,"But you that are young men in vigour,"
7266,BOOK VII.,All join to cut a special figure!
7267,BOOK VII.,"If you daren't fight the man, e'en say;"
7268,BOOK VII.,"Don't trembling stand, like stags at bay,"
7269,BOOK VII.,"But trust your heels and run away,"
7270,BOOK VII.,"If you can't keep your breeches dry,"
7271,BOOK VII.,"You'd better, as you run, let fly;"
7272,BOOK VII.,"Unless you fancy Hector may,"
7273,BOOK VII.,"Should you in such condition stay,"
7274,BOOK VII.,"First stop his nose, then run away."
7275,BOOK VII.,
7276,BOOK VII.,This drolling speech o' th' queer old wight
7277,BOOK VII.,Made 'em all scratch where't did not bite;
7278,BOOK VII.,"So eager now they grew to smite him,"
7279,BOOK VII.,That nine jump'd up at once to fight him.
7280,BOOK VII.,"Great Agamemnon swore' and curs'd,"
7281,BOOK VII.,And damn'd his eyes but he'd be first;
7282,BOOK VII.,"At which bold Diomede was vex'd,"
7283,BOOK VII.,But swore by Pallas he'd be next:
7284,BOOK VII.,"Ajax, who seldom spoke a word,"
7285,BOOK VII.,"Roars out, By Jove, I'll be the third!"
7286,BOOK VII.,"'Cause Agamemnon swore in passion,"
7287,BOOK VII.,Ajax thought swearing was the fashion.
7288,BOOK VII.,"The bold Oileus too was there,"
7289,BOOK VII.,"Who swore by G-d he would not swear,"
7290,BOOK VII.,"Ajax, says he, is third, don't part us,"
7291,BOOK VII.,But put my name in <i>locus quartus</i>.
7292,BOOK VII.,"Idomeneus, though not so swift"
7293,BOOK VII.,"As brave Oileus, came in fifth."
7294,BOOK VII.,"Then on Euripylus they fix,"
7295,BOOK VII.,And mark his back with number six;
7296,BOOK VII.,Merion thought it no disgrace
7297,BOOK VII.,To come and take the seventh place.
7298,BOOK VII.,"Bold Thoas was a man of weight,"
7299,BOOK VII.,So him they put in number eight.
7300,BOOK VII.,"Ulysses saw, by what was done,"
7301,BOOK VII.,He must at all events make one;
7302,BOOK VII.,"Look'd fierce to hide his inward fear,"
7303,BOOK VII.,And boldly came to close the rear.
7304,BOOK VII.,The motion felt at first for sh----g
7305,BOOK VII.,Was strangely chang'd to one for fighting.
7306,BOOK VII.,
7307,BOOK VII.,"When Nestor found his speech succeed,"
7308,BOOK VII.,"He spoke again: My boys, take heed!"
7309,BOOK VII.,You'd like to've quarrel'd who should run:
7310,BOOK VII.,And now each wishes he'd begun first:
7311,BOOK VII.,"But, to prevent all future diff'rence"
7312,BOOK VII.,"About our giving one the pref'rence,"
7313,BOOK VII.,I'd have you take the good advice
7314,BOOK VII.,Of Sancho's[1] lawyer--box and dice;
7315,BOOK VII.,"And it shall be his lot to go,"
7316,BOOK VII.,That trundles out the highest throw;
7317,BOOK VII.,"Whoe'er he be, the valiant buck"
7318,BOOK VII.,Will think himself in hellish[2] luck.
7319,BOOK VII.,
7320,BOOK VII.,"He spoke, and then his case unlocks,"
7321,BOOK VII.,And out he lugs both dice and box.
7322,BOOK VII.,"The bullies then begin to pray,"
7323,BOOK VII.,"But, on my soul, 'tis hard to say,"
7324,BOOK VII.,Whether to lose or win the day:
7325,BOOK VII.,"But to the bully Ajax all,"
7326,BOOK VII.,"In secret, wish'd the lot might fall."
7327,BOOK VII.,"Nestor their meaning understood,"
7328,BOOK VII.,And tipp'd 'em all the wink it shou'd.
7329,BOOK VII.,
7330,BOOK VII.,"[Illustration: Book VII, page 25."
7331,BOOK VII.,Then Ajax grasps his clumsy fist
7332,BOOK VII.,And gives the box a devilish twist--
7333,BOOK VII.,Out pop the dice--cries Nestor; Seven
7334,BOOK VII.,"'S the main; a nick, by Jove, eleven.]"
7335,BOOK VII.,
7336,BOOK VII.,Atrides then his elbows shak'd
7337,BOOK VII.,Though inwardly his gizzard quak'd:
7338,BOOK VII.,"But soon he was reliev'd this bout,"
7339,BOOK VII.,"For Nestor cries, Aums ace, you're out:"
7340,BOOK VII.,"Then Ajax grasps his clumsy fist,"
7341,BOOK VII.,And gives the box a dev'lish twist--
7342,BOOK VII.,"Out pops the dice, cries Nestor--Seven"
7343,BOOK VII.,"'S the main; a nick, by Jove, eleven."
7344,BOOK VII.,Another throw then Ajax tries:
7345,BOOK VII.,"Eight is the main, old Nestor cries;"
7346,BOOK VII.,"Resolv'd his jobbernoul to cozen,"
7347,BOOK VII.,"Roars out, Another nick, a dozen!"
7348,BOOK VII.,"And so it might, I swear and vow,"
7349,BOOK VII.,"For aught that honest Ajax knew,"
7350,BOOK VII.,"Who took on trust whate'er was done,"
7351,BOOK VII.,"So whipp'd his fighting-jacket on,"
7352,BOOK VII.,Whilst all the rest could hardly help
7353,BOOK VII.,From laughing at the thick-skull'd whelp.
7354,BOOK VII.,
7355,BOOK VII.,"O warriors! cries this, head of cod,"
7356,BOOK VII.,"I'll smoke great Hector's hide, by G-d!"
7357,BOOK VII.,"But lend me first each man a prayer,"
7358,BOOK VII.,So low the Trojans may not hear:
7359,BOOK VII.,"But let 'em hear; on recollection,"
7360,BOOK VII.,To pray is no such great reflection:
7361,BOOK VII.,No mortal scrub on earth dare say
7362,BOOK VII.,That I'm afraid because I pray.
7363,BOOK VII.,"In days of old, though 'twas but rare."
7364,BOOK VII.,Men bold as me have said a pray'r;
7365,BOOK VII.,"Cromwell himself, I've heard folks say,"
7366,BOOK VII.,Like any popish saint could pray;
7367,BOOK VII.,"And yet, when people were not civil,"
7368,BOOK VII.,Could swear and bully like a devil.
7369,BOOK VII.,"Then bring the man alive or dead,"
7370,BOOK VII.,That valiant Ajax ought to dread:
7371,BOOK VII.,"Not Warwick's earl, that kicking cub,"
7372,BOOK VII.,"Whose arm could whirl so thick a club,"
7373,BOOK VII.,That all our grannies tell us how
7374,BOOK VII.,He kill'd a whacking great dun cow--
7375,BOOK VII.,"Was he alive, I make no doubt"
7376,BOOK VII.,"To kill him, and his cow to-boot."
7377,BOOK VII.,"In Salamis my mother bore me,"
7378,BOOK VII.,And bid me kick the world before me.
7379,BOOK VII.,
7380,BOOK VII.,"No more he said, but on the stones"
7381,BOOK VII.,"Dropp'd down upon his marrow-bones,"
7382,BOOK VII.,"Held up his hands, and then began"
7383,BOOK VII.,To say his lesson like a man;
7384,BOOK VII.,"His comrades too perform their parts,"
7385,BOOK VII.,And club their prayers with all their hearts;
7386,BOOK VII.,"But, like the Jews, the varlets made"
7387,BOOK VII.,D----'d ugly faces[3] whilst they pray'd:
7388,BOOK VII.,O father Jove! whose greatest pride-a
7389,BOOK VII.,Is whoring on the mount of Ida!
7390,BOOK VII.,Now grant that honest Ajax may
7391,BOOK VII.,Give the first broken head to-day:
7392,BOOK VII.,"But, if thou guard'st those Trojan cattle,"
7393,BOOK VII.,"Then grant it may be a drawn battle,"
7394,BOOK VII.,"That, like the German and the Gaul,"
7395,BOOK VII.,"Both sides may sing, and roar, and bawl"
7396,BOOK VII.,"Te Deum, though for nought at all,"
7397,BOOK VII.,And tell their God a cursed lie;
7398,BOOK VII.,That both have got the victory.
7399,BOOK VII.,
7400,BOOK VII.,"Now Ajax, 'cause the coat he put on"
7401,BOOK VII.,"Was left without a single button,"
7402,BOOK VII.,"To keep it tight, he ty'd it fast"
7403,BOOK VII.,"With a rope's end about his waist,"
7404,BOOK VII.,"Then like a Spaniard struts, who prides"
7405,BOOK VII.,To show his wrath in mighty strides.
7406,BOOK VII.,"Great joy ran through the Grecian bands,"
7407,BOOK VII.,Though his hands shak'd like drunken Rand's:
7408,BOOK VII.,"And, whilst he was the Trojan eyeing,"
7409,BOOK VII.,He grinn'd to keep himself from crying.
7410,BOOK VII.,"The Greeks were humm'd, and Troy, besides,"
7411,BOOK VII.,Was scar'd to see him take such strides.
7412,BOOK VII.,Hector himself was wond'ring that
7413,BOOK VII.,His mighty heart went pit-a-pat;
7414,BOOK VII.,"Though now there was no time to take,"
7415,BOOK VII.,But he must brew as well as bake.
7416,BOOK VII.,"Ajax behind his shield did keep,"
7417,BOOK VII.,But ventur'd now and then to peep;
7418,BOOK VII.,"A dev'lish thumping shield it was,"
7419,BOOK VII.,'Twould load an English ox or ass;
7420,BOOK VII.,"Look Scotland through till you are blind,"
7421,BOOK VII.,So large a targe you'll hardly find:
7422,BOOK VII.,"Seven good tup-skins as can be seen,"
7423,BOOK VII.,Cover'd a greasy kitchen-screen.
7424,BOOK VII.,"The roast-meat side of which, we find,"
7425,BOOK VII.,With old tin cannisters was lin'd:
7426,BOOK VII.,"One Tychius, who dwelt in Hyle,"
7427,BOOK VII.,"Where Yorkshire shoes are made most vilely,"
7428,BOOK VII.,"Finish'd this shield, and made it neat,"
7429,BOOK VII.,By sawing off two clumsy feet:
7430,BOOK VII.,This potlid Ajax held before
7431,BOOK VII.,"His guts, and then began to roar:"
7432,BOOK VII.,
7433,BOOK VII.,"Hector, come here, you whelp, and try"
7434,BOOK VII.,"Who cudgels best, or you or I."
7435,BOOK VII.,Achilles dare not come--who cares?
7436,BOOK VII.,You see as good a man that dares;
7437,BOOK VII.,"Let him sit sulky, if he will;"
7438,BOOK VII.,His place great Ajax' self dares fill:
7439,BOOK VII.,Bold hearts like me we have good store;
7440,BOOK VII.,"There's three, I'm certain, if not four,"
7441,BOOK VII.,That any hour o' th' day are willing
7442,BOOK VII.,To box for sixpence or a shilling;
7443,BOOK VII.,"Nay, some for half a crown will try,"
7444,BOOK VII.,When cash and courage both run high:
7445,BOOK VII.,"So, let me lose the day or win it,"
7446,BOOK VII.,Here I stand ready to begin it.
7447,BOOK VII.,
7448,BOOK VII.,"Hector replies, Great son of Tel,"
7449,BOOK VII.,You seem to scold it pretty well;
7450,BOOK VII.,"But, sure, you think the rock of Troy"
7451,BOOK VII.,"Some chuckle-headed booby boy,"
7452,BOOK VII.,"Just parted from a country school,"
7453,BOOK VII.,And therefore dares not face an owl;
7454,BOOK VII.,"But I will face you, you shall see,"
7455,BOOK VII.,Though you were in an ivy-tree.
7456,BOOK VII.,"And look'd as fierce before you spoke,"
7457,BOOK VII.,As Charley in the royal oak:
7458,BOOK VII.,"I dare, for th' honour of our house,"
7459,BOOK VII.,Say boh! to any Grecian goose.
7460,BOOK VII.,Your broomshaft strokes with ease I'll cut off.
7461,BOOK VII.,And all Broughtonian thumps can put off;
7462,BOOK VII.,But as I value not a f--t
7463,BOOK VII.,"Your puffs, I shan't make use of art;"
7464,BOOK VII.,"By downright strength I'll try my fate,"
7465,BOOK VII.,And scorn to steal a broken pate.
7466,BOOK VII.,
7467,BOOK VII.,"At this his quarter-staff he rears,"
7468,BOOK VII.,And laid about the Grecian's ears:
7469,BOOK VII.,"His nob he gave a swingeing knock,"
7470,BOOK VII.,But might as well have hit a rock.
7471,BOOK VII.,"Ajax then drove at Hector's crown,"
7472,BOOK VII.,"Who flinch'd, or else he'd knock'd him down;"
7473,BOOK VII.,"So vastly furious was the stroke,"
7474,BOOK VII.,Both quarter-staves to pieces broke.
7475,BOOK VII.,"The cudgels next the bullies try,"
7476,BOOK VII.,And baste each other hip and thigh;
7477,BOOK VII.,"Fierce as two squabbling lawyers prate,"
7478,BOOK VII.,"Or two fish-wives at Billingsgate,"
7479,BOOK VII.,"And seem'd to be a special match,"
7480,BOOK VII.,Till Hector got a little scratch.
7481,BOOK VII.,His wrath to see his blood run down
7482,BOOK VII.,"Made him let fly a thumping stone,"
7483,BOOK VII.,"Which hit his pate, and off did pass"
7484,BOOK VII.,As if his noddle had been brass.
7485,BOOK VII.,But Ajax threw with such a shock
7486,BOOK VII.,"A craggy ragged piece of rock,"
7487,BOOK VII.,"And aim'd the stone so well, that he"
7488,BOOK VII.,Almost demolish'd Hector's knee.
7489,BOOK VII.,Hector was glad to lean upon
7490,BOOK VII.,"His potlid, else he'd tumbled down:"
7491,BOOK VII.,"But Sol, who always did attend him,"
7492,BOOK VII.,Brought him a dram of rum to mend him.
7493,BOOK VII.,"Andrew Ferrara's next the word,"
7494,BOOK VII.,"For each had got a highland sword,"
7495,BOOK VII.,"Which when they flourish'd in the air,"
7496,BOOK VII.,The glitt'ring blades made people stare.
7497,BOOK VII.,"Just as they met in guise uncivil,"
7498,BOOK VII.,"Like great St. Michael and the devil,"
7499,BOOK VII.,"With fell intent to cut and slash,"
7500,BOOK VII.,"And of their bodies make a hash,"
7501,BOOK VII.,"The wary seconds both popp'd out,"
7502,BOOK VII.,And put an end to this tough bout.
7503,BOOK VII.,Talthybius did the Greek attend;
7504,BOOK VII.,Idæus was great Hector's friend;
7505,BOOK VII.,(Both constables and cunning knaves)
7506,BOOK VII.,Betwixt the swords they thrust their staves.
7507,BOOK VII.,"Idæus first began to speak,"
7508,BOOK VII.,For he had learnt a little Greek:
7509,BOOK VII.,
7510,BOOK VII.,"Forbear, my buffs, your farther fray,"
7511,BOOK VII.,Jove says ye fight no more to-day;
7512,BOOK VII.,No more of bus'ness can be done
7513,BOOK VII.,"To-day, because the day is gone."
7514,BOOK VII.,
7515,BOOK VII.,"Ajax was now grown cock-a-hoop,"
7516,BOOK VII.,Because he could with Hector cope;
7517,BOOK VII.,"Pray, Sir, says he, to Hector speak:"
7518,BOOK VII.,He challeng'd forth the boldest Greek.
7519,BOOK VII.,"If he should say 'tis time to part,"
7520,BOOK VII.,I'll give it up with all my heart;
7521,BOOK VII.,"But he, you both must own, begun first,"
7522,BOOK VII.,"And therefore ought, I think, t'have done first."
7523,BOOK VII.,
7524,BOOK VII.,"Then Hector speaks: Great Sir, you're right;"
7525,BOOK VII.,"And, if you dare but trust your sight,"
7526,BOOK VII.,By looking sharp you'll see 'tis night:
7527,BOOK VII.,"And you and all the people know,"
7528,BOOK VII.,To box at night's against the law:
7529,BOOK VII.,"For want of light, we by surprise"
7530,BOOK VII.,Might knock out one another's eyes;
7531,BOOK VII.,"And e'en just now, so dark it grows,"
7532,BOOK VII.,I scarce can see your copper nose:
7533,BOOK VII.,So let's decide some other day
7534,BOOK VII.,Who's the best man at cudgel-play:
7535,BOOK VII.,"Your great escape the Greeks will tell of,"
7536,BOOK VII.,They'll jump to find you're come so well off;
7537,BOOK VII.,And all the good old wives in Troy
7538,BOOK VII.,At my escape will jump for joy.
7539,BOOK VII.,"But let us make, this glorious day,"
7540,BOOK VII.,"Some sort of swap, that folks may say,"
7541,BOOK VII.,"These souls were neither Whig nor Tory,"
7542,BOOK VII.,But battled for their country's glory.
7543,BOOK VII.,
7544,BOOK VII.,"With that a sword he gave, whose hilt"
7545,BOOK VII.,"Was made of brass, but double gilt:"
7546,BOOK VII.,This gift did Ajax' stomach melt
7547,BOOK VII.,"So much, he gave his greasy belt:"
7548,BOOK VII.,Then with a Spanish air those twain
7549,BOOK VII.,Majestic strutted home again.
7550,BOOK VII.,
7551,BOOK VII.,"[Illustration: Book VII, page 37."
7552,BOOK VII.,In this queer trim the Grecians bring
7553,BOOK VII.,"The puff'd-up hero to the king,"
7554,BOOK VII.,"Who, far from thinking 'twas a man,"
7555,BOOK VII.,Thought they had drest a sack of bran
7556,BOOK VII.,"In Ajax' clothes,--]"
7557,BOOK VII.,
7558,BOOK VII.,"Hector, at his return to Troy,"
7559,BOOK VII.,Did really make 'em jump for joy:
7560,BOOK VII.,"They star'd, but yet the better half"
7561,BOOK VII.,Came up to feel if he was safe.
7562,BOOK VII.,"Poor Ajax was swell'd up and puff'd,"
7563,BOOK VII.,Like a black-pudding over-stuff'd.
7564,BOOK VII.,In this queer trim the Grecians bring
7565,BOOK VII.,"The puff'd-up hero to the king,"
7566,BOOK VII.,"Who, far from thinking 'twas a man,"
7567,BOOK VII.,Thought they had dress'd a sack of bran
7568,BOOK VII.,"In Ajax' clothes; but, being fully"
7569,BOOK VII.,Convinc'd it was the very bully
7570,BOOK VII.,"That could with valiant Hector box,"
7571,BOOK VII.,He bid the butcher kill an ox.
7572,BOOK VII.,"That you mayn't think the gen'ral boasted,"
7573,BOOK VII.,A fine Scotch runt was kill'd and roasted:
7574,BOOK VII.,"Great Agamemnon laid the cloth,"
7575,BOOK VII.,Then boil'd the neck and shanks for broth.
7576,BOOK VII.,"When all was cook'd, the king took care"
7577,BOOK VII.,To deal each hungry knave his share:
7578,BOOK VII.,But valiant Ajax for his supper
7579,BOOK VII.,Ate the sirloin and half the crupper;
7580,BOOK VII.,"By which you'll think, and think aright,"
7581,BOOK VII.,The man could eat as well as fight.
7582,BOOK VII.,"When they had stuff'd their bellies full,"
7583,BOOK VII.,"And drunk each man a hearty pull,"
7584,BOOK VII.,"Nestor begins, who never long"
7585,BOOK VII.,Was known to hold his noisy tongue:
7586,BOOK VII.,
7587,BOOK VII.,It grieves my very guts to say
7588,BOOK VII.,"That this has been a dismal day,"
7589,BOOK VII.,But faith it was: upon the shore
7590,BOOK VII.,"A dozen hearty cocks, or more,"
7591,BOOK VII.,"Were on their backs by Hector laid,"
7592,BOOK VII.,And half of them half-knock'd o' th' head.
7593,BOOK VII.,"Whilst we are drown'd in grief and sorrow,"
7594,BOOK VII.,How can we think to box to-morrow?
7595,BOOK VII.,A little time should sure be found
7596,BOOK VII.,To get our dead men under ground;
7597,BOOK VII.,"Which if we don't, I know full well"
7598,BOOK VII.,They'll quickly make a cursed smell:
7599,BOOK VII.,"To Hector's drubs we need not yield,"
7600,BOOK VII.,Our friends will stink us off the field.
7601,BOOK VII.,"When we have got them under ground,"
7602,BOOK VII.,"Both rotten carcasses and sound,"
7603,BOOK VII.,Each man shall have a handsome stone
7604,BOOK VII.,For babes to cry or piss upon:
7605,BOOK VII.,Next we will all our bricklay'rs call up
7606,BOOK VII.,"To dig a ditch and build a wall up,"
7607,BOOK VII.,"To save our huts, and boats, and lighters,"
7608,BOOK VII.,From those damn'd copper-nos'd sheep-biters;
7609,BOOK VII.,"Then make strong gates, that, if the rout"
7610,BOOK VII.,"Should come too near, we'll bolt 'em out;"
7611,BOOK VII.,"Next on the walls build towers, and prop 'em;"
7612,BOOK VII.,"The devil's in't, if that don't stop 'em:"
7613,BOOK VII.,"Then if the foe comes helter skelter,"
7614,BOOK VII.,We all know where to run for shelter:
7615,BOOK VII.,"For want of this, if they should beat us,"
7616,BOOK VII.,"They burn our boats, and roast and eat us."
7617,BOOK VII.,
7618,BOOK VII.,"Thus spake this queer old Grecian wight,"
7619,BOOK VII.,And all the captains thought him right.
7620,BOOK VII.,In the mean time the Trojan peers
7621,BOOK VII.,"Were met, and almost got by th' ears:"
7622,BOOK VII.,"Though their hearts ach'd, this crew so factious"
7623,BOOK VII.,Could not refrain from being fractious:
7624,BOOK VII.,"All order they despis'd, or summons,"
7625,BOOK VII.,Just like an English house of -------.
7626,BOOK VII.,"At last the grave Antenor rose,"
7627,BOOK VII.,And strove their diff'rence to compose.
7628,BOOK VII.,
7629,BOOK VII.,"What I shall utter is no merit,"
7630,BOOK VII.,"'Tis inspiration of the spirit,"
7631,BOOK VII.,"Says 'this old cuff: Restore but Helen,"
7632,BOOK VII.,And we our houses safe may dwell in;
7633,BOOK VII.,Let Helen and her money go
7634,BOOK VII.,"To Sparta or to Strumbello,"
7635,BOOK VII.,With all belongs her head or tail;
7636,BOOK VII.,Don't keep the paring of a nail.
7637,BOOK VII.,If Paris hath not got enough
7638,BOOK VII.,"Of trimming her bewitching buff,"
7639,BOOK VII.,"But longs to switch the gipsy still,"
7640,BOOK VII.,You'll own with me he never will;
7641,BOOK VII.,Then must be forc'd--and so I vote
7642,BOOK VII.,To do the very thing he ought:
7643,BOOK VII.,"We broke the truce, the Grecians felt us,"
7644,BOOK VII.,"And Jupiter, by G-d, will pelt us;"
7645,BOOK VII.,"Then let us quickly stir about,"
7646,BOOK VII.,And do't before you're forc'd to do't.
7647,BOOK VII.,
7648,BOOK VII.,"Th' old Trojan spoke, and down he sat,"
7649,BOOK VII.,When Paris rose and twirl'd his hat;
7650,BOOK VII.,"Smelt at his box, perfum'd with musk,"
7651,BOOK VII.,"Then hem'd, and look'd as fierce as H--k:"
7652,BOOK VII.,"You say your speech must claim no merit,"
7653,BOOK VII.,'Tis inspiration of the spirit;
7654,BOOK VII.,"But, if the matter I can handle,"
7655,BOOK VII.,"A canting quaker's farthing candle,"
7656,BOOK VII.,"Twinkling within him, gives more light"
7657,BOOK VII.,Than this of yours that burns so bright.
7658,BOOK VII.,When young perhaps you might be wise;
7659,BOOK VII.,Wisdom decays as well as eyes:
7660,BOOK VII.,You think that I have had enough
7661,BOOK VII.,Of trimming Helen's heav'nly buff.
7662,BOOK VII.,"The thought is mighty well for you,"
7663,BOOK VII.,For whom three times a year might do;
7664,BOOK VII.,"But Helen ne'er shall quit my hand,"
7665,BOOK VII.,So long as I can go or stand.
7666,BOOK VII.,As for the money that she brought
7667,BOOK VII.,"From Greece, I scorn to touch a groat;"
7668,BOOK VII.,"It lies, with his tobacco-stopper"
7669,BOOK VII.,"(Five pounds in silver, three in copper),"
7670,BOOK VII.,"In an old trunk, with some old gear"
7671,BOOK VII.,I never yet would let her wear.
7672,BOOK VII.,"Let Menelaus touch the pelf,"
7673,BOOK VII.,I only want to touch herself.
7674,BOOK VII.,"Besides, I'll pay him for the touch,"
7675,BOOK VII.,And give him twenty times as much
7676,BOOK VII.,"From my own stock as she brought with her,"
7677,BOOK VII.,When first she came from Sparta hither:
7678,BOOK VII.,"But ere she goes, by holy Paul!"
7679,BOOK VII.,I'll see the devil fetch ye all.
7680,BOOK VII.,
7681,BOOK VII.,"Priam, who fear'd by all this rout"
7682,BOOK VII.,"His trusty Trojans might fall out,"
7683,BOOK VII.,Rose up to speak; the crew so vi'lent
7684,BOOK VII.,Had the good manners to be silent;
7685,BOOK VII.,"On which th' old Trojan bow'd to each,"
7686,BOOK VII.,"Then hem'd, and made this king-like speech:"
7687,BOOK VII.,"Ye hearts of oak, that round me sit,"
7688,BOOK VII.,What think ye if we pick a bit?
7689,BOOK VII.,"I saw the cook-maid, Mary, put on"
7690,BOOK VII.,"The spit a thumping loin of mutton,"
7691,BOOK VII.,Above an hour and half ago;
7692,BOOK VII.,"It must be ready now, I know."
7693,BOOK VII.,"When we have pick'd the bones and tail,"
7694,BOOK VII.,"And each man drunk a gill of ale,"
7695,BOOK VII.,"We'll guard the walls, and all the night"
7696,BOOK VII.,Look sharp to keep our matters right:
7697,BOOK VII.,A bellman in the morn shall mention.
7698,BOOK VII.,To the Greek captain our intention;
7699,BOOK VII.,"And add, 'twill suit us to a tittle,"
7700,BOOK VII.,"If both sides take their breath a little,"
7701,BOOK VII.,That those who on the ground are laid
7702,BOOK VII.,May come and tell us if they're dead;
7703,BOOK VII.,"If they're alive, we can assure them,"
7704,BOOK VII.,Our quacks will either kill or cure 'em;
7705,BOOK VII.,"Then, if they please, with might and main"
7706,BOOK VII.,"We'll buckle to't, and box again."
7707,BOOK VII.,
7708,BOOK VII.,"Soon as the Trojan long had said,"
7709,BOOK VII.,Each captain seiz'd a piece of bread;
7710,BOOK VII.,"But could not stay to pick a bit,"
7711,BOOK VII.,So whipp'd a slice from off the spit;
7712,BOOK VII.,"Then pocketing both bread and roast,"
7713,BOOK VII.,Ran off to eat it at their post.
7714,BOOK VII.,"Before the sun brush'd up his lamp,"
7715,BOOK VII.,Idæus went to th' Grecian camp:
7716,BOOK VII.,"He found the chief, his friends, and brother,"
7717,BOOK VII.,Looking as wise at one another
7718,BOOK VII.,"As justices, when on the bench"
7719,BOOK VII.,"They try some poor unlucky wrench,"
7720,BOOK VII.,And make the jade at Bridewell yelp
7721,BOOK VII.,For breeding brats without their help:
7722,BOOK VII.,"The bellman tinkled first his bell,"
7723,BOOK VII.,And then began his tale to tell:--
7724,BOOK VII.,
7725,BOOK VII.,"Ye Grecian constables, I pray"
7726,BOOK VII.,Lend all your ears to what I say;
7727,BOOK VII.,"And from my soul I wish, to ease ye,"
7728,BOOK VII.,That ev'ry word I speak may please ye:
7729,BOOK VII.,I wish our rogue and your d----d whore
7730,BOOK VII.,Had both been drowned long before
7731,BOOK VII.,"This hubble bubble they had coin'd,"
7732,BOOK VII.,By getting both their giblets join'd!
7733,BOOK VII.,I wish the brimstone's pepper'd tail
7734,BOOK VII.,Was in the belly of that whale
7735,BOOK VII.,"That swallow'd Jonah, though the Jew"
7736,BOOK VII.,"Had such rank flesh, he made him spew;"
7737,BOOK VII.,"And I'm afraid this self-same whale,"
7738,BOOK VII.,"After he'd swallow'd Nelly's tail,"
7739,BOOK VII.,"Though plaguy salt, would find it stale;"
7740,BOOK VII.,"Therefore, like Jonah, on the main"
7741,BOOK VII.,Would come to spew her up again;
7742,BOOK VII.,And then some luckless country will
7743,BOOK VII.,Be plagu'd with her grimalkin still.
7744,BOOK VII.,"But for all this, I'm bid to tell ye,"
7745,BOOK VII.,That Paris will not part with Nelly;
7746,BOOK VII.,"He finds her flesh so very sweet,"
7747,BOOK VII.,He swears he'll touch no other meat;
7748,BOOK VII.,But says he'll give you ev'ry piece
7749,BOOK VII.,Of money that she brought from Greece:
7750,BOOK VII.,"And, if he can but peace restore,"
7751,BOOK VII.,Will double it ten times o'er and o'er;
7752,BOOK VII.,"But swears the wench sha'n't quit his hand,"
7753,BOOK VII.,So long as he can go or stand.
7754,BOOK VII.,Next I'm to say 'twill suit us well
7755,BOOK VII.,"To rest our weary limbs a spell,"
7756,BOOK VII.,"That those who lie in honour's bed,"
7757,BOOK VII.,"Whether knock'd down or knock'd o' th' head,"
7758,BOOK VII.,"May be sought out, and, when they're found,"
7759,BOOK VII.,Be decently put under ground;
7760,BOOK VII.,"And then with all our might and main,"
7761,BOOK VII.,"If so ye like, we'll box again:"
7762,BOOK VII.,"But who shall drub the other well,"
7763,BOOK VII.,The Lord above can only tell.
7764,BOOK VII.,
7765,BOOK VII.,"The Grecian chiefs, by what appears,"
7766,BOOK VII.,Both cock'd their mouths and prick'd their ears;
7767,BOOK VII.,"But, like a modern bill in chancer',"
7768,BOOK VII.,They took some time to give an answer.
7769,BOOK VII.,"This did Tydides so provoke,"
7770,BOOK VII.,He jump'd upon his legs and spoke:
7771,BOOK VII.,
7772,BOOK VII.,"Zooks! you would make a parson swear,"
7773,BOOK VII.,To see ye all thus gape and stare!
7774,BOOK VII.,"What signifies their money now,"
7775,BOOK VII.,Though they would send the brimstone too?
7776,BOOK VII.,"You see their wooden towers are shaken,"
7777,BOOK VII.,Then what the pox can save their bacon?
7778,BOOK VII.,"Let us but kick 'em out of doors,"
7779,BOOK VII.,And the same men that shook their towers
7780,BOOK VII.,"Shall shake their daughters, wives, and whores."
7781,BOOK VII.,The Grecians shout their approbation
7782,BOOK VII.,Of this laconic bold oration.
7783,BOOK VII.,"Atrides then the peace rejects,"
7784,BOOK VII.,But sends to Priam his respects:
7785,BOOK VII.,
7786,BOOK VII.,"You hear, good Sir, the shouts of Greece"
7787,BOOK VII.,"Are, to a man, against this peace."
7788,BOOK VII.,"As much as you all broils we hate,"
7789,BOOK VII.,But think the peace <i>inadequate</i>:
7790,BOOK VII.,"Yet, though we can't agree to peace,"
7791,BOOK VII.,"I really think club-law should cease,"
7792,BOOK VII.,"That we may both sides look about,"
7793,BOOK VII.,And try to find our dead men out.
7794,BOOK VII.,"When yours are found, pray don't you think"
7795,BOOK VII.,That they are dead because they stink;
7796,BOOK VII.,"For ours, that liv'd to run away,"
7797,BOOK VII.,Stunk most confoundedly to-day;
7798,BOOK VII.,"Therefore take care you turn and turn 'em,"
7799,BOOK VII.,And shake 'em well before you burn 'em:I
7800,BOOK VII.,"speak lest groundless fears should curb ye,"
7801,BOOK VII.,For blast my eyes if we'll disturb ye!
7802,BOOK VII.,
7803,BOOK VII.,"He then, to show he meant 'em fair,"
7804,BOOK VII.,Flourish'd his broomshaft in the air.
7805,BOOK VII.,On this the crier trots away
7806,BOOK VII.,"To Troy, to tell 'em what they say."
7807,BOOK VII.,"The Trojan boys were got together,"
7808,BOOK VII.,Like flocks of birds in frosty weather:
7809,BOOK VII.,"Thus gather'd on a heap he caught 'em,"
7810,BOOK VII.,Waiting to hear what news he brought 'em.
7811,BOOK VII.,"Finding there was no time to spare,"
7812,BOOK VII.,"He hem'd, to make his throttle clear:"
7813,BOOK VII.,"They instant leave him room to enter,"
7814,BOOK VII.,And place him in the very centre;
7815,BOOK VII.,From whence he with a crier's voice
7816,BOOK VII.,(Where words are mostly drown'd in noise)
7817,BOOK VII.,His speech deliver'd full as clear
7818,BOOK VII.,As any crier you shall hear:
7819,BOOK VII.,
7820,BOOK VII.,"The Grecian captains, from their tents,"
7821,BOOK VII.,To Priam send their compliments;
7822,BOOK VII.,"And, though they can't consent to peace,"
7823,BOOK VII.,They all desire club-law should cease:
7824,BOOK VII.,"'Cause then both parties might, they said,"
7825,BOOK VII.,See if their dead men were all dead.
7826,BOOK VII.,
7827,BOOK VII.,"The Trojans, upon this, thought good,"
7828,BOOK VII.,To buy some loads of billet wood;
7829,BOOK VII.,But to the Greeks no man would sell it:
7830,BOOK VII.,On which they thought 'twas best to fell it
7831,BOOK VII.,Without the lord o' th' manor's leave;
7832,BOOK VII.,So instantly began to cleave.
7833,BOOK VII.,"But I can tell 'em, had they then"
7834,BOOK VII.,"Been caught by justice F--d--g's men,"
7835,BOOK VII.,"Those true-bred hounds would never drop 'em,"
7836,BOOK VII.,Till they had seen his worship shop 'em.
7837,BOOK VII.,
7838,BOOK VII.,"The sun had wash'd his fiery face,"
7839,BOOK VII.,"And greas'd his wheels to run his race,"
7840,BOOK VII.,When Greeks and Trojans look'd about
7841,BOOK VII.,To find who'd got their brains knock'd out;
7842,BOOK VII.,"But neither side had time to weep,"
7843,BOOK VII.,Till all were gather'd on a heap.
7844,BOOK VII.,"The Trojans then to burning fall,"
7845,BOOK VII.,And made one crying serve 'em all.
7846,BOOK VII.,"The Grecians thought th' example good,"
7847,BOOK VII.,So out they lugg'd their stolen wood:
7848,BOOK VII.,"Then laid the bodies in their places,"
7849,BOOK VII.,And fell to making d---d wry faces.
7850,BOOK VII.,"When they were burnt as black as coal,"
7851,BOOK VII.,One lousy tombstone serv'd 'em all.
7852,BOOK VII.,
7853,BOOK VII.,"This done, with might and main they fall"
7854,BOOK VII.,"To dig a ditch, and build a wall;"
7855,BOOK VII.,"For Nestor, who had still some cunning,"
7856,BOOK VII.,"Guess'd, when the rascals took to running,"
7857,BOOK VII.,This wall might stop the Trojan fighters
7858,BOOK VII.,From burning their old rotten lighters.
7859,BOOK VII.,Upon the wall these Grecian powers
7860,BOOK VII.,Erected what themselves call'd towers:
7861,BOOK VII.,But in these days our modern doxies
7862,BOOK VII.,Would call them hobbling watchmen's boxes.
7863,BOOK VII.,"Some baker's billets next they took,"
7864,BOOK VII.,"The sharpen'd points did outward look,"
7865,BOOK VII.,The blunt end stuck in earth; and these
7866,BOOK VII.,The Grecians call chevaux de frise.
7867,BOOK VII.,
7868,BOOK VII.,"But whilst they thus their labour kept on,"
7869,BOOK VII.,They rather discomfrontled Neptune.
7870,BOOK VII.,"As near to surly Jove he sat,"
7871,BOOK VII.,"Brother, says he, I'll tell you what;"
7872,BOOK VII.,"If Greece should finish yon mud wall,"
7873,BOOK VII.,"And those I built for Troy should fall,"
7874,BOOK VII.,This wall will be remember'd longer
7875,BOOK VII.,"Than those I built, though so much stronger."
7876,BOOK VII.,"This, by my soul, I shall not like!--"
7877,BOOK VII.,"Ha' done, says Jove, thou wrangling tike!"

7891,BOOK VII.,"Whilst thus they fratch'd, the Greeks were getting"
7892,BOOK VII.,"Just finish'd, as the sun was setting;"
7893,BOOK VII.,And then the hungry sons of whores
7894,BOOK VII.,Butcher'd their bulls and cows by scores;
7895,BOOK VII.,"The fat sirloins on spits they put,"

7897,BOOK VII.,Just as they clapp'd 'em on their crupper

7903,BOOK VII.,"Eunæus did the ale procure,"
7904,BOOK VII.,For he was only small-beer brewer;
7905,BOOK VII.,A cask of both sorts did he send
7906,BOOK VII.,A present for the king his friend;
7907,BOOK VII.,"The rest the Grecian captains bought,"
7908,BOOK VII.,To pay for which our author thought
7909,BOOK VII.,"Some pawn'd a shirt, and some a coat."
7910,BOOK VII.,"In feasting all their cares were sunk,"
7911,BOOK VII.,And ev'ry noble chief got drunk;
7912,BOOK VII.,"But they had made a woeful blunder,"
7913,BOOK VII.,"For Jove they pinch'd, who growl'd like thunder;"
7914,BOOK VII.,"Which scar'd the drunken rogues so sore,"
7915,BOOK VII.,They spill'd their liquor on the floor;
7916,BOOK VII.,"And, in the midst of all their airs,"
7917,BOOK VII.,"Forgot their oaths to say their pray'rs,"
7918,BOOK VII.,"And beg such coil he would not keep,"

8132,BOOK VIII.,"On which, a little time to kill,"
8133,BOOK VIII.,He sat him down o' th' top o' th hill;

8230,BOOK VIII.,"One misty day, when none could see us,"

8232,BOOK VIII.,"Then leave thy shabby tits, don't mind 'em,"

8241,BOOK VIII.,"His own old yawds[3], so lank and bare,"
8242,BOOK VIII.,He left to two skip-kennels' care;
8243,BOOK VIII.,And care no doubt the backward ways

8245,BOOK VIII.,"Old Nestor drove, for he was carter,"
8246,BOOK VIII.,Full speed to meet this Trojan tartar.
8247,BOOK VIII.,Tydides aim'd at Hector's crown;
8248,BOOK VIII.,"It miss'd, but brought his coachman down."
8249,BOOK VIII.,"Hector no nearer could approach,"
8250,BOOK VIII.,For want of one to drive his coach;
8251,BOOK VIII.,"So whipp'd behind, and for a stiver"
8252,BOOK VIII.,He quickly hir'd another driver:
8253,BOOK VIII.,"One Archeptolemus arose,"
8254,BOOK VIII.,A coachman with a fine red nose;
8255,BOOK VIII.,"But Hector had no time to stay,"
8256,BOOK VIII.,So hir'd the rascal for the day.
8257,BOOK VIII.,And now this Diomede would soon
8258,BOOK VIII.,Have made the conqu'ring Trojans run
8259,BOOK VIII.,"Like sheep before the Spanish Don[4],"
8260,BOOK VIII.,"But Jove again began to growl,"
8261,BOOK VIII.,And thunder'd from his mustard-bowl[5].
8262,BOOK VIII.,"Lightning so near the Greek did pass,"
8263,BOOK VIII.,"It sing'd his nose, and burnt the grass."
8264,BOOK VIII.,"The frighten'd nags began to prance,"
8265,BOOK VIII.,"And Nestor dropp'd into a trance,"
8266,BOOK VIII.,"But soon recover'd, and begun"
8267,BOOK VIII.,"To chatter: Zoons! says he, let's run;"
8268,BOOK VIII.,To-day the thunder-clap director
8269,BOOK VIII.,"Swears he will fight for none but Hector,"
8270,BOOK VIII.,So let's jog off; perhaps he may
8271,BOOK VIII.,Take Nestor's part another day:
8272,BOOK VIII.,"But, spite of all our labour, still"
8273,BOOK VIII.,You know he will do what he will.

8279,BOOK VIII.,Rot me! before it shall be said
8280,BOOK VIII.,"I ran for't, he shall break my head."
8281,BOOK VIII.,
8282,BOOK VIII.,Nestor replies: O sad! O sad!
8283,BOOK VIII.,The man is surely drunk or mad!
8284,BOOK VIII.,"Why, what the plague can Hector say?"
8285,BOOK VIII.,He never made you run away:
8286,BOOK VIII.,"That whelp is sensible enough,"
8287,BOOK VIII.,You've dusted many a Trojan's buff;
8288,BOOK VIII.,But the most wicked sons of plunder
8289,BOOK VIII.,"With lightning dare not fight, nor thunder."
8290,BOOK VIII.,
8291,BOOK VIII.,"He said no more, but crack'd his whip,"
8292,BOOK VIII.,And gave the Trojan chief the slip:
8293,BOOK VIII.,"The horses run along the coast,"
8294,BOOK VIII.,"As fast as country priests ride post,"
8295,BOOK VIII.,"When death, assisted by good liquor,"
8296,BOOK VIII.,Was seiz'd some neighb'ring guzzling vicar:
8297,BOOK VIII.,"The Trojans shout, as well they might,"
8298,BOOK VIII.,To see them in such hellish fright:
8299,BOOK VIII.,"When Hector calls to Diomede,"
8300,BOOK VIII.,You've special heels in time of need;
8301,BOOK VIII.,For this th' Argives will give their chief
8302,BOOK VIII.,For his own share a rump of beef.
8303,BOOK VIII.,"Though Hector's self you dare not face,"
8304,BOOK VIII.,You beat him hollow in the race;
8305,BOOK VIII.,"I find you are, when blows you're shunnin'"
8306,BOOK VIII.,The devil of a hand at running.
8307,BOOK VIII.,You see to what your bragging comes;
8308,BOOK VIII.,You shake our walls! you kiss our bums:
8309,BOOK VIII.,"Though yet, perhaps, I'll dust your coat"
8310,BOOK VIII.,Before you reach your crazy boat.
8311,BOOK VIII.,
8312,BOOK VIII.,The Grecian bully could not bear
8313,BOOK VIII.,Such cutting kind of jokes to hear.
8314,BOOK VIII.,"Thrice the bold chief his horses stopp'd,"
8315,BOOK VIII.,And thrice the bold proposal dropp'd;
8316,BOOK VIII.,"For Thunder, in the shape of Fear,"
8317,BOOK VIII.,Whisper'd the warrior in the ear:
8318,BOOK VIII.,
8319,BOOK VIII.,For what the devil should you stay?
8320,BOOK VIII.,"I'm sure, if you don't run away,"
8321,BOOK VIII.,You'll get your hide well drubb'd to-day.
8322,BOOK VIII.,
8323,BOOK VIII.,"This counsel by the chief was taken,"
8324,BOOK VIII.,Who smok'd alone and say'd his bacon.
8325,BOOK VIII.,"Great Hector, with no little glee,"
8326,BOOK VIII.,"The lightning saw as well as he,"
8327,BOOK VIII.,But to his sense each thunder crack
8328,BOOK VIII.,Felt like a cheering clap o' th' back.
8329,BOOK VIII.,
8330,BOOK VIII.,Then to his trusty Trojans spoke:
8331,BOOK VIII.,"Ye backs of steel, and hearts of oak,"
8332,BOOK VIII.,"Remember what our grandames tell us,"
8333,BOOK VIII.,"That all our dads were clever fellows,"
8334,BOOK VIII.,And not a man but what would scorn
8335,BOOK VIII.,To flinch from duty night and morn;
8336,BOOK VIII.,"Therefore dismiss all needless fears,"
8337,BOOK VIII.,Because Jove's rumbling thunder swears
8338,BOOK VIII.,We now shall lug the Grecians' ears.
8339,BOOK VIII.,"Advance then quick, we'll surely end 'em;"
8340,BOOK VIII.,Yon muddy walls shall ne'er defend 'em.
8341,BOOK VIII.,"Soon as we've drove them down their hatches,"
8342,BOOK VIII.,"Lug out your tinder-box and matches,"
8343,BOOK VIII.,And strike a light; we first will swinge 'em
8344,BOOK VIII.,"With broomstaves, then with links we'll singe 'em."
8345,BOOK VIII.,He spoke; and bid his horses go
8346,BOOK VIII.,"In words like these, Gee up! gee ho!"
8347,BOOK VIII.,"Ball, Jolly, Driver, hi! gee hi!"
8348,BOOK VIII.,"Old Dobbin, zoons! why don't you fly?"
8349,BOOK VIII.,"Perform your journey well this day,"
8350,BOOK VIII.,You ne'er shall want both corn and hay.
8351,BOOK VIII.,"You know my dame, when I return,"
8352,BOOK VIII.,Is always ready with your corn:
8353,BOOK VIII.,"You're sure good measure there will be,"
8354,BOOK VIII.,No cheating ostler keeps the key;
8355,BOOK VIII.,"Run till I catch that Diom's buff coat,"
8356,BOOK VIII.,Or Nestor's potlid and his rough coat.
8357,BOOK VIII.,"Gain me but these before ye tire,"
8358,BOOK VIII.,And then I'll set their boats on fire.
8359,BOOK VIII.,
8360,BOOK VIII.,"This Juno heard, that scolding witch,"
8361,BOOK VIII.,"And gave her buttocks such a twitch,"
8362,BOOK VIII.,"It shook her three-legg'd milking-stool,"
8363,BOOK VIII.,Which shook the stars from pole to pole.
8364,BOOK VIII.,
8365,BOOK VIII.,"Neptune! says she, I vow and swear"
8366,BOOK VIII.,To me it seems a little queer
8367,BOOK VIII.,"That you should see those Grecians beaten,"
8368,BOOK VIII.,"Whose victuals you so oft have eaten,"
8369,BOOK VIII.,"Those Greeks, by whom you're daily fed"
8370,BOOK VIII.,With bullock's liver and sheep's head.
8371,BOOK VIII.,Both Egœ and Helice too
8372,BOOK VIII.,"An ordinary keep for you,"
8373,BOOK VIII.,And stuff your guts three times a week
8374,BOOK VIII.,"With fry'd cow-heel and bak'd ox-cheek,"
8375,BOOK VIII.,At their own proper charge and cost;
8376,BOOK VIII.,Yet you sit still and see 'em lost.
8377,BOOK VIII.,"Would their own gods take heart and stand,"
8378,BOOK VIII.,With all my soul I'd lend a hand;
8379,BOOK VIII.,"Nor could that cross-grain'd surly elf,"
8380,BOOK VIII.,"My precious husband, help himself,"
8381,BOOK VIII.,"But, whilst he saw the Trojans tumble,"
8382,BOOK VIII.,Sit still and hear his own guts grumble.
8383,BOOK VIII.,
8384,BOOK VIII.,"The water God, in great surprise,"
8385,BOOK VIII.,"First shakes his noddle, then replies:"
8386,BOOK VIII.,"I ken your jade's trick mighty well,"
8387,BOOK VIII.,"You'd have me, like yourself, rebel;"
8388,BOOK VIII.,"But I know better: you're his wife,"
8389,BOOK VIII.,And therefore may rebel for life;
8390,BOOK VIII.,"Wives for rebellion plead old custom,"
8391,BOOK VIII.,"And they will keep it up, I trust 'em:"
8392,BOOK VIII.,We're sensible 'tis nothing more
8393,BOOK VIII.,Than what their mothers did before:
8394,BOOK VIII.,"Content I'll keep the way I'm in,"
8395,BOOK VIII.,And slumber in a whole calf's skin.
8396,BOOK VIII.,
8397,BOOK VIII.,"And now the mighty mob of Troy,"
8398,BOOK VIII.,"By Hector led, the Greeks annoy:"
8399,BOOK VIII.,"Close by the ditch they threat'ning stand,"
8400,BOOK VIII.,With flaming hedge-stakes in their hand:
8401,BOOK VIII.,"Poor Agamemnon, in a fit"
8402,BOOK VIII.,"Of fear, was very nigh besh-t."
8403,BOOK VIII.,But Juno help'd him with a touch
8404,BOOK VIII.,"To some small courage, though not much"
8405,BOOK VIII.,"He ran, and carried in his hand"
8406,BOOK VIII.,The royal ensign of command;
8407,BOOK VIII.,"An old red flannel petticoat,"
8408,BOOK VIII.,"That once belong'd a dame of note,"
8409,BOOK VIII.,"But happening in her trade to fail,"
8410,BOOK VIII.,Atrides bought it at her sale.
8411,BOOK VIII.,"The back part and the sides, to view,"
8412,BOOK VIII.,Appear'd almost as good as new;
8413,BOOK VIII.,"But, notwithstanding all her care,"
8414,BOOK VIII.,The breadth before was worn thread-bare.
8415,BOOK VIII.,"Mounted upon Ulysses' boat,"
8416,BOOK VIII.,"He way'd this flaming petticoat,"
8417,BOOK VIII.,And thus began to tune his throat;
8418,BOOK VIII.,"But roar'd so loud, and was so scar'd."
8419,BOOK VIII.,"Both Ajax and Ulysses heard,"
8420,BOOK VIII.,"Though separated by the fleet,"
8421,BOOK VIII.,"'Tis thought, at least, five hundred feet:"
8422,BOOK VIII.,
8423,BOOK VIII.,"O, all ye (Grecian paltry dogs!"
8424,BOOK VIII.,"The vessels echo'd back, Damn'd rogues!)"
8425,BOOK VIII.,Where are your mighty boasts at dinner
8426,BOOK VIII.,'Gainst Troy? each single Greek would win her!
8427,BOOK VIII.,"Whilst your ungodly guts ye fill,"
8428,BOOK VIII.,You all look fierce as Bobadil:
8429,BOOK VIII.,"Now, I'm convinc'd each single glutton,"
8430,BOOK VIII.,"If Troy's strong walls were made of mutton,"
8431,BOOK VIII.,"Would eat his way into the town,"
8432,BOOK VIII.,And quickly pull their houses down;
8433,BOOK VIII.,"Yet now, though driven on a heap,"
8434,BOOK VIII.,Dare all as well be d--d as peep
8435,BOOK VIII.,"Across the ditch to look at Hector,"
8436,BOOK VIII.,"Who will in less, as I conjecture,"
8437,BOOK VIII.,"Than half an hour quite overturn us,"
8438,BOOK VIII.,And in our rotten scullers burn us:--
8439,BOOK VIII.,"O Jupiter! whose strength is mickle,"
8440,BOOK VIII.,Was ever man in such a pickle?
8441,BOOK VIII.,"My limbs impair'd with claps and pox,"
8442,BOOK VIII.,And curs'd with rogues that dare not box;
8443,BOOK VIII.,"But they, the battle once begun,"
8444,BOOK VIII.,"Don't stoutly fight, but stoutly run;"
8445,BOOK VIII.,For thee I've broil'd ten thousand cuts
8446,BOOK VIII.,"Of bullock's hearts and pecks of guts,"
8447,BOOK VIII.,"Then only ask'd a slender boon,"
8448,BOOK VIII.,Leave to demolish that damn'd town:
8449,BOOK VIII.,"But since you won't give leave, we pray"
8450,BOOK VIII.,"You'll let us drub the dogs to-day,"
8451,BOOK VIII.,Just to get time to run away.
8452,BOOK VIII.,
8453,BOOK VIII.,"Thus roar'd the king, in doleful dumps,"
8454,BOOK VIII.,Then on the sandy shore he jumps.
8455,BOOK VIII.,"To hear this melancholy ditty,"
8456,BOOK VIII.,Jove could not help a little pity;
8457,BOOK VIII.,"From off his three-legg'd stool he starts up,"
8458,BOOK VIII.,And sent a sign to cheer their hearts up.
8459,BOOK VIII.,"Behold, a hungry carrion-crow"
8460,BOOK VIII.,"Had got within his beak, or claw,"
8461,BOOK VIII.,"A frog; but someway out it popp'd,"
8462,BOOK VIII.,And 'mongst the hungry Grecians dropp'd.
8463,BOOK VIII.,"To Frenchmen this, instead of beating,"
8464,BOOK VIII.,Had been a sign of rare good eating;
8465,BOOK VIII.,"They would have jump'd, if from the bogs"
8466,BOOK VIII.,The crows had brought ten thousand frogs;
8467,BOOK VIII.,It even rais'd the Grecians' courage
8468,BOOK VIII.,More than a bellyful of porridge;
8469,BOOK VIII.,"They on a sudden turn about,"
8470,BOOK VIII.,And strive who first shall sally out.
8471,BOOK VIII.,"That bullying, noisy, scolding bitch,"
8472,BOOK VIII.,"Call'd Diomede, first leap'd the ditch,"
8473,BOOK VIII.,"And dealt such furious strokes to rout 'em,"
8474,BOOK VIII.,He made the Trojans look about 'em.
8475,BOOK VIII.,The first that ply'd his heels to run
8476,BOOK VIII.,"Was Agelaüs, Phradmon's son--"
8477,BOOK VIII.,A noted broker in the Alley--
8478,BOOK VIII.,He saw this furious Grecian sally;
8479,BOOK VIII.,"On which he nimbly limp'd along,"
8480,BOOK VIII.,As brokers do when things go wrong;
8481,BOOK VIII.,"But the bold Grecian mark'd him soon,"
8482,BOOK VIII.,And with a broomstick fetch'd him down
8483,BOOK VIII.,(This Diom. had a wondrous knack
8484,BOOK VIII.,Of hitting folks behind their back):
8485,BOOK VIII.,"As down he tumbled in a sweat,"
8486,BOOK VIII.,His potlid and his noddle met;
8487,BOOK VIII.,"And made between 'em such a hum,"
8488,BOOK VIII.,It sounded like a kettle-drum.
8489,BOOK VIII.,"Now that a passage once was made,"
8490,BOOK VIII.,"The Greeks, though woefully afraid,"
8491,BOOK VIII.,Seem'd quite asham'd to let that elf
8492,BOOK VIII.,Tydides box it by himself;
8493,BOOK VIII.,"On which the Atrides show'd their faces,"
8494,BOOK VIII.,And after them the fool Ajaces:
8495,BOOK VIII.,"Meriones was next, and then"
8496,BOOK VIII.,Appear'd the bruiser Idomen:
8497,BOOK VIII.,"Ulysses thrust his long neck out,"
8498,BOOK VIII.,"To peep with caution round about,"
8499,BOOK VIII.,"And saw all safe, so ventur'd out;"
8500,BOOK VIII.,"Which when the archer Teucer saw,"
8501,BOOK VIII.,"He ventur'd to bring out his bow,"
8502,BOOK VIII.,Then with a gimlet bor'd a hole
8503,BOOK VIII.,"Through Ajax' potlid, whence he stole"
8504,BOOK VIII.,"A peep, to see what kind of spark"
8505,BOOK VIII.,Stood most convenient for his mark;
8506,BOOK VIII.,"On which he shot a dart, and plump"
8507,BOOK VIII.,Behind the targe again did jump.
8508,BOOK VIII.,"Thus rats and mice, fry dagger prest,"
8509,BOOK VIII.,Skip nimbly back into their nest;
8510,BOOK VIII.,"And honest Ajax lugg'd, in troth;"
8511,BOOK VIII.,A potlid big enough for both.
8512,BOOK VIII.,"My dear Miss Muse, pray let us know"
8513,BOOK VIII.,Who tumbled first by this long bow.
8514,BOOK VIII.,"I will, my ragged friend, says she,"
8515,BOOK VIII.,Because you ask so prettily:
8516,BOOK VIII.,"Orsilochus, a friend to Venus,"
8517,BOOK VIII.,"First fell, and after him Ormenus."
8518,BOOK VIII.,One kept a dram-shop in the Strand;
8519,BOOK VIII.,T' other sold clothes at second-hand
8520,BOOK VIII.,"In Monmouth-street; where if you've been, Sir,"
8521,BOOK VIII.,"You must have heard him cry, Walk in, Sir!"
8522,BOOK VIII.,"Then Lycophron, a tailor, fell,"
8523,BOOK VIII.,And went to mend old clothes in hell;
8524,BOOK VIII.,Unlucky dog! the Fates did twist his
8525,BOOK VIII.,"Small thread of life with Ophelestes,"
8526,BOOK VIII.,"A button-maker, who was shot,"
8527,BOOK VIII.,And then poor Chromius went to pot.
8528,BOOK VIII.,"Scarce was he down upon his back,"
8529,BOOK VIII.,When Dacer fell with such a whack
8530,BOOK VIII.,"Upon his ribs, it made 'em crack."
8531,BOOK VIII.,"This Dacer was a penny barber,"
8532,BOOK VIII.,That us'd both whores and rogues to harbour;
8533,BOOK VIII.,"So got his living within doors,"
8534,BOOK VIII.,By shaving culls and curling whores.
8535,BOOK VIII.,"Bold Hamopaon next he handles,"
8536,BOOK VIII.,A famous maker of wax candles;
8537,BOOK VIII.,"Although of late he grew but shallow,"
8538,BOOK VIII.,And mix'd his wax with stinking tallow.
8539,BOOK VIII.,Fierce Melenippus could not keep
8540,BOOK VIII.,"His feet, but tumbled on the heap:"
8541,BOOK VIII.,"He in the Borough kept a slop-shop,"
8542,BOOK VIII.,Exactly o'er against a hop-shop;
8543,BOOK VIII.,"From Teucer's bow an arrow pops,"
8544,BOOK VIII.,And bump'd his guts through all his slops.
8545,BOOK VIII.,"Besides all these, this spawn of whore"
8546,BOOK VIII.,Reports he fell'd a dozen more:
8547,BOOK VIII.,But I can't think much credit's due
8548,BOOK VIII.,To one that shoots so long a bow.
8549,BOOK VIII.,
8550,BOOK VIII.,When Agamemnon saw this whelp
8551,BOOK VIII.,"Knocking folks down without his help,"
8552,BOOK VIII.,"He jump'd and skipp'd, and cried, Huzza!"
8553,BOOK VIII.,"I wish, my boy, that ev'ry day"
8554,BOOK VIII.,You'd shown us this same sort of play:
8555,BOOK VIII.,Of mighty service it had been
8556,BOOK VIII.,To keep the Grecians' breeches clean.
8557,BOOK VIII.,"Since thou canst shoot with such a smack,"
8558,BOOK VIII.,Well may thy good old daddy crack;
8559,BOOK VIII.,"Than his true-born he loves thee more,"
8560,BOOK VIII.,Because thy mother was a whore.
8561,BOOK VIII.,"He quickly saw thy early worth,"
8562,BOOK VIII.,And from the Foundling brought thee forth;
8563,BOOK VIII.,"Where, hadst thou staid, thou'dst been a tailor,"
8564,BOOK VIII.,"Or else a blacksmith, or a nailer;"
8565,BOOK VIII.,"But, proud to find he'd such a son,"
8566,BOOK VIII.,He paid the charge and brought thee home.
8567,BOOK VIII.,Now hear a Brentford monarch speak:
8568,BOOK VIII.,"If Troy should tumble down next week,"
8569,BOOK VIII.,"First, for myself, you may be sure,"
8570,BOOK VIII.,"I shall provide a buxom whore,"
8571,BOOK VIII.,"Or three or four, or happen more;"
8572,BOOK VIII.,"But when my proper share is reckon'd,"
8573,BOOK VIII.,"Depend upon't, you shall be second."
8574,BOOK VIII.,"Besides a noble piece of gold,"
8575,BOOK VIII.,"And twenty shillings three times told,"
8576,BOOK VIII.,I'll answer that the sons of Greece
8577,BOOK VIII.,Will let you choose the next-best piece.
8578,BOOK VIII.,
8579,BOOK VIII.,"The youth replies: I would have you, Sir,"
8580,BOOK VIII.,Know that your bribes are lost on Teucer;
8581,BOOK VIII.,"I neither fight for ale nor cake,"
8582,BOOK VIII.,But drub the dogs for mischief's sake;
8583,BOOK VIII.,"I hate the Trojans, and would eat 'em,"
8584,BOOK VIII.,Was there no other way to beat 'em:
8585,BOOK VIII.,"Eight darts I sent, and aim'd 'em full"
8586,BOOK VIII.,At bully Hector's knotty skull;
8587,BOOK VIII.,"They hit eight sons of whores, 'tis granted,"
8588,BOOK VIII.,But Hector was the whore's-bird wanted:
8589,BOOK VIII.,Some damn'd old Lapland witch incog.
8590,BOOK VIII.,Defends that blust'ring Trojan dog.
8591,BOOK VIII.,
8592,BOOK VIII.,"Just as the words were out, he straight"
8593,BOOK VIII.,Let fly again at Hector's pate.
8594,BOOK VIII.,"Again the arrow miss'd its mark,"
8595,BOOK VIII.,"But hit another Trojan spark,"
8596,BOOK VIII.,"Gorgythio call'd, of royal blood:"
8597,BOOK VIII.,Old Priam got him when he could
8598,BOOK VIII.,Stand stiffly to't; then all on fire-a
8599,BOOK VIII.,"He kiss'd his mother Castianira,"
8600,BOOK VIII.,"And got this youth, as fine a boy"
8601,BOOK VIII.,As ever broke a lamp in Troy.
8602,BOOK VIII.,"Have you not, at the tailors' feast,"
8603,BOOK VIII.,"Beheld by chance a weak-brain'd guest,"
8604,BOOK VIII.,"Who is to drink no longer able,"
8605,BOOK VIII.,But rests his head upon the table?
8606,BOOK VIII.,Just so this luckless lad did rest
8607,BOOK VIII.,His heavy nob upon his breast.
8608,BOOK VIII.,"Another dart this spark, hap-hazard,"
8609,BOOK VIII.,Let fly once more at Hector's mazzard:
8610,BOOK VIII.,It miss'd; which made the Greek conjecture
8611,BOOK VIII.,Apollo turn'd the shaft from Hector--
8612,BOOK VIII.,"Although it did not miss so far,"
8613,BOOK VIII.,But brought the driver off the car;
8614,BOOK VIII.,"Poor Archeptolemus's jaws,"
8615,BOOK VIII.,The coachman with the copper nose.
8616,BOOK VIII.,It hit; his leather jacket rumbled
8617,BOOK VIII.,"So loud, as on the ground he tumbled,"
8618,BOOK VIII.,That all the horses in the cart
8619,BOOK VIII.,Could not refrain a sudden start.
8620,BOOK VIII.,"When Hector saw his coachman fall,"
8621,BOOK VIII.,"It vex'd his liver, guts, and all."
8622,BOOK VIII.,"Cebriones, a country lout,"
8623,BOOK VIII.,"By chance was gaping round about,"
8624,BOOK VIII.,To him the bully Hec. calls out:
8625,BOOK VIII.,"Here, you, Sir, come and drive this cart;"
8626,BOOK VIII.,"And if you find the horses start,"
8627,BOOK VIII.,"Keep a tight hand and proper check,"
8628,BOOK VIII.,"Or else, by Jove, they'll break your neck."
8629,BOOK VIII.,"Then out he jumps, and, stooping down,"
8630,BOOK VIII.,Took up a fine Scotch paving-stone;
8631,BOOK VIII.,"Just as the Grecian's bow was bent,"
8632,BOOK VIII.,Hector this hard Scotch paving sent
8633,BOOK VIII.,"With such a force, it broke the bow,"
8634,BOOK VIII.,And snapp'd the catgut string in two;
8635,BOOK VIII.,"Then smack'd his guts with such a thump,"
8636,BOOK VIII.,He fell'd him flat upon his rump:
8637,BOOK VIII.,"Alastor and Mecisteus bore him,"
8638,BOOK VIII.,And Ajax clapp'd his potlid o'er him:
8639,BOOK VIII.,"In this condition, all besh-t,"
8640,BOOK VIII.,They lugg'd him to the Grecian fleet.
8641,BOOK VIII.,"And now old father Jove, we find,"
8642,BOOK VIII.,Began to think he'd chang'd his mind
8643,BOOK VIII.,"Too soon; on which he fac'd about,"
8644,BOOK VIII.,To help the drooping Trojans out.
8645,BOOK VIII.,"The Greeks again forsook the fray,"
8646,BOOK VIII.,And like brave fellows ran away:
8647,BOOK VIII.,"Hard at their tails bold Hector keeps,"
8648,BOOK VIII.,"And drives them into th' ditch on heaps,"
8649,BOOK VIII.,"Pelted their Dutch-made heavy rumps,"
8650,BOOK VIII.,And ply'd 'em off with kicks and thumps.
8651,BOOK VIII.,"Thus I a farmer's cur have seen,"
8652,BOOK VIII.,"When sheep are driven o'er the green,"
8653,BOOK VIII.,"A constant waughing does he keep,"
8654,BOOK VIII.,But only bites the hindmost sheep:
8655,BOOK VIII.,Thus did this fiery son of Mars
8656,BOOK VIII.,Lend the last knave a kick o' th' a--e;
8657,BOOK VIII.,"And now when, out of breath for haste,"
8658,BOOK VIII.,"With loss of men the ditch they'd pass'd,"
8659,BOOK VIII.,"These fighting fellows, all so stout,"
8660,BOOK VIII.,Just made a shift to turn about;
8661,BOOK VIII.,There they saw Hector's cart-wheels reach
8662,BOOK VIII.,"The very edge of this great ditch,"
8663,BOOK VIII.,"And there he stood, the Grecians fright'ning"
8664,BOOK VIII.,"So much, they swore his eyes were lightning."
8665,BOOK VIII.,Some of their wise old soakers said
8666,BOOK VIII.,His noddle was a Gorgon's head:
8667,BOOK VIII.,But one deep-learn'd north-country elf
8668,BOOK VIII.,Swore 'twas the muckle de'il himself;
8669,BOOK VIII.,"For oft before his face he'd seen,"
8670,BOOK VIII.,And ken'd him by his saucer eyne.
8671,BOOK VIII.,
8672,BOOK VIII.,"Juno, whose nose was mighty tickle,"
8673,BOOK VIII.,"Soon smelt their most unsavoury pickle,"
8674,BOOK VIII.,"And, calling out to Pallas, cries:"
8675,BOOK VIII.,"Smite my black muff, and blast my eyes,"
8676,BOOK VIII.,If all my patience is not gone
8677,BOOK VIII.,To see the Grecians so run down!
8678,BOOK VIII.,"Help me to save 'em now or never,"
8679,BOOK VIII.,"Or else the dogs are lost for ever,"
8680,BOOK VIII.,"But how, we scarce have time to think;"
8681,BOOK VIII.,Smell you not how the rascals stink?
8682,BOOK VIII.,"Gods! shall one scoundrel do this evil,"
8683,BOOK VIII.,And drive such numbers to the devil?
8684,BOOK VIII.,"That son of a damn'd Trojan bitch,"
8685,BOOK VIII.,See how he scares them 'cross the ditch!
8686,BOOK VIII.,
8687,BOOK VIII.,"Pallas replies, I see as well"
8688,BOOK VIII.,As you or any one can tell
8689,BOOK VIII.,What yon infernal rascal's doing;
8690,BOOK VIII.,But how to save our rogues from ruin
8691,BOOK VIII.,I can't devise; your surly mate
8692,BOOK VIII.,Won't let me break that Hector's pate:
8693,BOOK VIII.,"In vain to crack his skull I strive,"
8694,BOOK VIII.,Your Jove will neither lead nor drive:
8695,BOOK VIII.,Th' immortal rogues forget us soon
8696,BOOK VIII.,As mortal rogues a favour done:
8697,BOOK VIII.,"To me he came, and made great moan,"
8698,BOOK VIII.,"Begging that I would save his son,"
8699,BOOK VIII.,The mighty kill-cow Hercules--
8700,BOOK VIII.,A clumsier dog one seldom sees;
8701,BOOK VIII.,"And yet the thief, with rare hard sweating,"
8702,BOOK VIII.,Cost him three days and nights in getting!
8703,BOOK VIII.,"I whipp'd me down to lend him help,"
8704,BOOK VIII.,And often sav'd the clumsy whelp;
8705,BOOK VIII.,"But had I known his dad so well,"
8706,BOOK VIII.,"When last he took a trip to hell,"
8707,BOOK VIII.,"His journey should have been in vain,"
8708,BOOK VIII.,I ne'er had help'd him back again:
8709,BOOK VIII.,The stumbling-block that lay i' th' way.
8710,BOOK VIII.,"To hinder his return to-day,"
8711,BOOK VIII.,"I'd have been stuck before I'd lift it,"
8712,BOOK VIII.,But left the devil and him to shift it.
8713,BOOK VIII.,I've a good mind to go and beat his
8714,BOOK VIII.,"Beloved minx, that goody Thetis;"
8715,BOOK VIII.,"If e'er again she strokes his thighs,"
8716,BOOK VIII.,I'll give the brimstone two black eyes;
8717,BOOK VIII.,"To humour her curs'd bastard's freaks,"
8718,BOOK VIII.,He'll quite demolish all our Greeks;
8719,BOOK VIII.,"When 'tis too late, this face of gallows"
8720,BOOK VIII.,Will call me his beloved Pallas.
8721,BOOK VIII.,"Zounds! don't stay here to wink and pink,"
8722,BOOK VIII.,But get your chariot in a twink;
8723,BOOK VIII.,"Spite of the Thund'rer and his punk,"
8724,BOOK VIII.,We'll make those Trojan scoundrels funk;
8725,BOOK VIII.,"Let us but land upon the shore,"
8726,BOOK VIII.,Hector will hector them no more;
8727,BOOK VIII.,When I and Juno come to fight 'em;
8728,BOOK VIII.,The devil's in't if we can't fright 'em;
8729,BOOK VIII.,"And ten to one, but in a crack"
8730,BOOK VIII.,We'll lay this Broughton on his back.
8731,BOOK VIII.,"But if, in spite of all our cracks,"
8732,BOOK VIII.,"He lays us both upon our backs,"
8733,BOOK VIII.,"As things go now, the swagg'ring devil"
8734,BOOK VIII.,Will scarce have time to be uncivil:
8735,BOOK VIII.,"And if he has, his whoring sconce"
8736,BOOK VIII.,Can only trim us one at once;
8737,BOOK VIII.,"So whilst one gets her bus'ness done,"
8738,BOOK VIII.,The other will have time to run.
8739,BOOK VIII.,
8740,BOOK VIII.,"Her voice then ceas'd through rage and spleen,"
8741,BOOK VIII.,Whilst Jove's eternal scolding queen
8742,BOOK VIII.,"Lent the poor Trojans fifty curses,"
8743,BOOK VIII.,Before she went to fetch her horses;
8744,BOOK VIII.,"But yet, though pinch'd for time, took pains"
8745,BOOK VIII.,To tie red ribands to their manes:
8746,BOOK VIII.,When Pallas instantly threw down
8747,BOOK VIII.,"Her daggled petticoat and gown,"
8748,BOOK VIII.,"Nor staid to fold her ragged placket,"
8749,BOOK VIII.,But whipp'd her on a buff-skin jacket
8750,BOOK VIII.,"So glaz'd with grease all o'er the stitches,"
8751,BOOK VIII.,It shin'd like Ashley's greasy breeches.
8752,BOOK VIII.,"Upon the car she took her stand,"
8753,BOOK VIII.,"And shook a broomstaff in her hand,"
8754,BOOK VIII.,"So large, that, tie a proper heap"
8755,BOOK VIII.,"Of broom o' th' end on't, it would sweep"
8756,BOOK VIII.,"All London streets, I'm pretty sure,"
8757,BOOK VIII.,"Quite clean in less than half an hour,"
8758,BOOK VIII.,And souse into the Thames drive all
8759,BOOK VIII.,"The rubbish, aldermen and all."
8760,BOOK VIII.,"Juno soon got upon the box,"
8761,BOOK VIII.,And drives the geldings with a pox;
8762,BOOK VIII.,"The Hours, as they had done before"
8763,BOOK VIII.,Stood on the watch to ope the door.
8764,BOOK VIII.,"Eager to crack poor Hector's crown,"
8765,BOOK VIII.,They gallop'd neck or nothing down:
8766,BOOK VIII.,"But Jove, who kept a sharp look-out,"
8767,BOOK VIII.,"Saw what the brimstones were about,"
8768,BOOK VIII.,On which he calls for Kitty Iris:
8769,BOOK VIII.,"Kitty, says he, my pluck on fire is,"
8770,BOOK VIII.,And every toe about me itches
8771,BOOK VIII.,"To have a kick at yon damn'd bitches,"
8772,BOOK VIII.,Because so impudently they
8773,BOOK VIII.,My strict commands dare disobey:
8774,BOOK VIII.,"Fly, meet the brimstones both, and tell 'em"
8775,BOOK VIII.,"A thousand fathom deep I'll fell 'em,"
8776,BOOK VIII.,"Kill both their nags, and break their wheels,"
8777,BOOK VIII.,And tie the beldames neck and heels;
8778,BOOK VIII.,"And, spite of all that they can say,"
8779,BOOK VIII.,"Whether they scold, or swear, or pray,"
8780,BOOK VIII.,Expose their brawny bums together
8781,BOOK VIII.,"For ten long years to wind and weather,"
8782,BOOK VIII.,Where every passenger that comes
8783,BOOK VIII.,Shall take a slap at both their bums!
8784,BOOK VIII.,"But speak you to Minerva first,"
8785,BOOK VIII.,"Because, at present, she's the worst:"
8786,BOOK VIII.,"As for my rib, though shame to tell,"
8787,BOOK VIII.,She pleads old custom to rebel;
8788,BOOK VIII.,But now I mind her noise no more
8789,BOOK VIII.,Than Fielding minds a scolding whore.
8790,BOOK VIII.,
8791,BOOK VIII.,On this the rainbow goddess strides
8792,BOOK VIII.,"Her broomshaft, and away she rides:"
8793,BOOK VIII.,"(By Homer's own account, we find"
8794,BOOK VIII.,At any time she'd beat the wind).
8795,BOOK VIII.,"She met the chariot on the slope,"
8796,BOOK VIII.,"Plague on you both! says Iris, stop:"
8797,BOOK VIII.,Such foolish journeys why begin ye?
8798,BOOK VIII.,Jove thinks the devil must be in ye;
8799,BOOK VIII.,"And so do I: he bid me tell ye,"
8800,BOOK VIII.,A thousand fathom deep he'll fell ye.
8801,BOOK VIII.,"Kill both your nags, and break your wheels,"
8802,BOOK VIII.,And tie you by the neck and heels;
8803,BOOK VIII.,"And, spite of all that you can say,"
8804,BOOK VIII.,"Whether you scold, or swear, or pray,"
8805,BOOK VIII.,"Expose your brawny bums together,"
8806,BOOK VIII.,"For ten long years, to wind and weather,"
8807,BOOK VIII.,"Where every passenger that comes,"
8808,BOOK VIII.,Shall take a slap at both your bums:
8809,BOOK VIII.,"To you, Minerva, I speak first,"
8810,BOOK VIII.,Because he thinks you're now the worst:
8811,BOOK VIII.,"As for his rib, 'tis shame to tell,"
8812,BOOK VIII.,She pleads old custom to rebel;
8813,BOOK VIII.,But much he wonders what bewitches
8814,BOOK VIII.,"Your busy pate, you bitch of bitches[6]!"
8815,BOOK VIII.,
8816,BOOK VIII.,Like lightning then away she flew;
8817,BOOK VIII.,Her speech though made 'em both look blue:
8818,BOOK VIII.,"They star'd like honest Johnny Wade,"
8819,BOOK VIII.,When he one evening with the maid
8820,BOOK VIII.,"A game at pushpin had begun,"
8821,BOOK VIII.,And madam came before he'd done!
8822,BOOK VIII.,"But Juno, though her guts and mazzard"
8823,BOOK VIII.,"Work'd like a guile-fat, yet no hazard"
8824,BOOK VIII.,"She chose to run, so curb'd her swell,"
8825,BOOK VIII.,"And seem'd to take it mighty well,"
8826,BOOK VIII.,"But could not help from wriggling hard,"
8827,BOOK VIII.,"Like mother ****, when a card"
8828,BOOK VIII.,"Goes very cross, and cuts her soul"
8829,BOOK VIII.,By losing a sans-prendre vole.
8830,BOOK VIII.,
8831,BOOK VIII.,"Our rage, my crony, with a pox"
8832,BOOK VIII.,Has brought us to a damn'd wrong box;
8833,BOOK VIII.,"I've just found out, it strange and odd is,"
8834,BOOK VIII.,"That each of us, a powerful goddess,"
8835,BOOK VIII.,"Should with our crusty thund'rer squabble,"
8836,BOOK VIII.,And all for what?--A mortal rabble.
8837,BOOK VIII.,"E'en let 'em live with custard cramm'd,"
8838,BOOK VIII.,Or die all placemen and be damn'd;
8839,BOOK VIII.,"Let Jove give victory, or rout 'em,"
8840,BOOK VIII.,No more I'll fret my guts about 'em.
8841,BOOK VIII.,
8842,BOOK VIII.,"On this she gave her tits a smack,"
8843,BOOK VIII.,And pull'd the reins to keep 'em back;
8844,BOOK VIII.,"But all the while they turn'd 'em, she"
8845,BOOK VIII.,"Kept crying Gee, plague rot ye, gee!"
8846,BOOK VIII.,"When they were fairly turn'd about,"
8847,BOOK VIII.,"Full speed once more the tits set out,"
8848,BOOK VIII.,And gallop'd up the hill as soon
8849,BOOK VIII.,Within an ace as they came down:
8850,BOOK VIII.,"The Hours unloos'd 'em, rubb'd their coats,"
8851,BOOK VIII.,And gave 'em half a peck of oats;
8852,BOOK VIII.,"Then fetch'd clean straw to make their bed,"
8853,BOOK VIII.,And put the chariot in a shed;
8854,BOOK VIII.,"Whilst the two brims, with bashful faces,"
8855,BOOK VIII.,"Sneak'd off, and went to take their places."
8856,BOOK VIII.,
8857,BOOK VIII.,"And now old Jove was tir'd of Ida,"
8858,BOOK VIII.,And up to heaven he took a ride-a;
8859,BOOK VIII.,"But drove his geldings with such ire,"
8860,BOOK VIII.,For want of grease his wheels took fire.
8861,BOOK VIII.,"Lest they should burn the horses' bums,"
8862,BOOK VIII.,In a great splutter Neptune comes:
8863,BOOK VIII.,"With an old sail he call'd his fish-clout,"
8864,BOOK VIII.,"Which serv'd for table-cloth and dish-clout,"
8865,BOOK VIII.,"Th' old soaker in an instant reels out,"
8866,BOOK VIII.,And smothers both the burning wheels out.
8867,BOOK VIII.,"Away walk'd Jove, and took his seat"
8868,BOOK VIII.,I' th' hall where all their godships meet;
8869,BOOK VIII.,"But with such weight he mov'd his toe,"
8870,BOOK VIII.,"It made an earthquake here below,"
8871,BOOK VIII.,And in a wicked popish town
8872,BOOK VIII.,"Tumbled a hundred convents down,"
8873,BOOK VIII.,"And sent inquisitors and friars,"
8874,BOOK VIII.,"With shoals of other holy liars,"
8875,BOOK VIII.,"Smoothly, without a single rub,"
8876,BOOK VIII.,"To see their patron Beelzebub,"
8877,BOOK VIII.,Into whose territories though
8878,BOOK VIII.,"They all were certain they must go,"
8879,BOOK VIII.,Yet at that time you may be sure
8880,BOOK VIII.,They thought it rather premature.
8881,BOOK VIII.,
8882,BOOK VIII.,"But to the point. Like our lord mayor,"
8883,BOOK VIII.,"With solemn phiz, Jove took the chair;"
8884,BOOK VIII.,Juno and Pallas in the hall
8885,BOOK VIII.,Both look'd as if they'd something stole:
8886,BOOK VIII.,"They squinted up, and saw he frown'd,"
8887,BOOK VIII.,"So whipp'd their eyes upon the ground,"
8888,BOOK VIII.,And seem'd as gravely to be list'ning
8889,BOOK VIII.,As harlots at a country christ'ning:
8890,BOOK VIII.,He smil'd to find this lucky push
8891,BOOK VIII.,For once had made the brimstones blush;
8892,BOOK VIII.,So instantly began to chatter:
8893,BOOK VIII.,"Juno and Pallas, what's the matter?"
8894,BOOK VIII.,What made ye both return so soon?
8895,BOOK VIII.,I thought you'd ta'en a trip to town
8896,BOOK VIII.,"To pull some bawdy-houses down,"
8897,BOOK VIII.,"For Juno's sake, who can't endure"
8898,BOOK VIII.,The sight of either rogue or whore;
8899,BOOK VIII.,And therefore I expected soon
8900,BOOK VIII.,"To see the bagnios tumbling down,"
8901,BOOK VIII.,"And noseless rogues, eat up with pox,"
8902,BOOK VIII.,And whores in nothing but their smocks;
8903,BOOK VIII.,"Running, like devils, helter skelter"
8904,BOOK VIII.,To wine and brandy shops for shelter.
8905,BOOK VIII.,"Pray give me leave though to inquire,"
8906,BOOK VIII.,"Is Troy demolish'd, or on fire?"
8907,BOOK VIII.,"But know, ye vixens, I shall make"
8908,BOOK VIII.,"Your grumbling guts and gizzards ache,"
8909,BOOK VIII.,If e'er again ye dare to fratch
8910,BOOK VIII.,With him who is your overmatch;
8911,BOOK VIII.,For all the underlings o' the sky
8912,BOOK VIII.,When I begin to kick must fly.
8913,BOOK VIII.,"Therefore, I say, beware your mazzards,"
8914,BOOK VIII.,And run no more such foolish hazards:
8915,BOOK VIII.,"If my enchanted wand I shake,"
8916,BOOK VIII.,You'll feel your guts and livers quake:
8917,BOOK VIII.,"Whoever dares my wrath oppose,"
8918,BOOK VIII.,"With red-hot tongs I'll pinch his nose,"
8919,BOOK VIII.,"And make him caper, roar, and snivel,"
8920,BOOK VIII.,As great St. Dunstan did the Devil.
8921,BOOK VIII.,
8922,BOOK VIII.,The moment that he did begin
8923,BOOK VIII.,"This speech, the gipsies dropp'd their chin,"
8924,BOOK VIII.,"And ere he made an end o' th' song,"
8925,BOOK VIII.,Their faces grew a full yard long;
8926,BOOK VIII.,"But yet their comfort was, that all"
8927,BOOK VIII.,The race of whoring Troy would fall.
8928,BOOK VIII.,"Pallas so much with wrath was gor'd,"
8929,BOOK VIII.,She could not speak a single word:
8930,BOOK VIII.,But Juno's passion was so strong
8931,BOOK VIII.,She could not hold her noisy tongue;
8932,BOOK VIII.,"So, scolding at her usual rate,"
8933,BOOK VIII.,She thus attack'd her loving mate:
8934,BOOK VIII.,
8935,BOOK VIII.,"You know you're stronger far than all us,"
8936,BOOK VIII.,"Or else such names you durst not call us,"
8937,BOOK VIII.,But split me if I don't believe
8938,BOOK VIII.,You swinge the Greeks to make us grieve!
8939,BOOK VIII.,"'Tis not strict justice guides your rod,"
8940,BOOK VIII.,"'Tis contradiction all, by G-d!"
8941,BOOK VIII.,And yet you can pretend that no man
8942,BOOK VIII.,Is half so positive as woman;
8943,BOOK VIII.,But 'tis a base invented fiction:
8944,BOOK VIII.,Man taught poor woman contradiction:
8945,BOOK VIII.,"For Greece you sit and see us grieve,"
8946,BOOK VIII.,And won't an inch of comfort give;
8947,BOOK VIII.,"By your cross surly face we're snubb'd,"
8948,BOOK VIII.,And forc'd to see the Grecians drubb'd;
8949,BOOK VIII.,"But let us give 'em counsel fit,"
8950,BOOK VIII.,Or every soul will be besh-t.
8951,BOOK VIII.,
8952,BOOK VIII.,"To Jove she chatter'd at this rate,"
8953,BOOK VIII.,And thus reply'd old Surly-pate:
8954,BOOK VIII.,"Vulcan my thunder-bolts is bright'ning,"
8955,BOOK VIII.,And store of rosin's ground for lightning[7]:
8956,BOOK VIII.,Therefore to-morrow morn with thunder
8957,BOOK VIII.,"I'll scare 'em so, you need not wonder"
8958,BOOK VIII.,If half the ragged sons of bitches
8959,BOOK VIII.,With downright fear bepiss their breeches.
8960,BOOK VIII.,Nor let your restless gizzards grumble
8961,BOOK VIII.,Though you see dozens of 'em tumble;
8962,BOOK VIII.,"Hector sha'n't cease o' th' bum to kick 'em,"
8963,BOOK VIII.,"Or with his old cheese-toaster stick 'em,"
8964,BOOK VIII.,Till he shall lay his luckless paws
8965,BOOK VIII.,Across Pelides' fav'rite's jaws;
8966,BOOK VIII.,Then in a passion shall Achilles
8967,BOOK VIII.,Fight like a devil--such my will is:
8968,BOOK VIII.,"Nor shall it alter, though you stay"
8969,BOOK VIII.,And scold for ever and a day:
8970,BOOK VIII.,"To Lapland go, where witches dwell,"
8971,BOOK VIII.,"Or Strombello, the mouth of Hell;"
8972,BOOK VIII.,"There arm both conjurors and witches,"
8973,BOOK VIII.,"I'll smoke the dogs, and burn the bitches."
8974,BOOK VIII.,
8975,BOOK VIII.,"Meantime the Sun, with phiz so bright,"
8976,BOOK VIII.,"Walk'd off, and up came madam Night:"
8977,BOOK VIII.,The Grecians thought her mighty civil;
8978,BOOK VIII.,The Trojans wish'd her at the devil:
8979,BOOK VIII.,"But as the Greeks were forc'd to yield,"
8980,BOOK VIII.,The bully Trojans kept the field.
8981,BOOK VIII.,"Hector, resolv'd the dogs to maul,"
8982,BOOK VIII.,"Doth instantly a council call,"
8983,BOOK VIII.,That he might have their sanction to
8984,BOOK VIII.,Perform what he design'd to do--
8985,BOOK VIII.,"A trick, I've heard some people say,"
8986,BOOK VIII.,Our gen'rals practise to this day.
8987,BOOK VIII.,"But as the Grecians lay so near,"
8988,BOOK VIII.,"That they perhaps his speech might hear,"
8989,BOOK VIII.,"He led 'em to Scamander's banks,"
8990,BOOK VIII.,Where down they sat to ease their shanks.
8991,BOOK VIII.,His quarterstaff in his right hand
8992,BOOK VIII.,"He fix'd, to help to make him stand,"
8993,BOOK VIII.,On which he lean'd when he thought fit
8994,BOOK VIII.,(You know a speaker ne'er should sit
8995,BOOK VIII.,"Till his oration's at an end,"
8996,BOOK VIII.,Whether they do or not attend):
8997,BOOK VIII.,"This staff, which he in battle bore,"
8998,BOOK VIII.,"Was three yards long, or rather more,"
8999,BOOK VIII.,"With bladders tied each end thereon,"
9000,BOOK VIII.,To scare folks as he knock'd 'em down.
9001,BOOK VIII.,
9002,BOOK VIII.,"Forward the chief his body bends,"
9003,BOOK VIII.,"Like Gl-ver, and began, My friends,"
9004,BOOK VIII.,"If you will yield me due attention,"
9005,BOOK VIII.,"Some thoughts that just occur, I'll mention"
9006,BOOK VIII.,This day we hop'd the Grecian boats
9007,BOOK VIII.,"To burn, and steal their thread-bare coats;"
9008,BOOK VIII.,"But, to our great and grievous sorrow,"
9009,BOOK VIII.,"We cannot do it till to-morrow,"
9010,BOOK VIII.,"Because that blackguard, Mrs. Night,"
9011,BOOK VIII.,Came in and drove away the light.
9012,BOOK VIII.,"Howe'er, 'tis fit, by beat of drum,"
9013,BOOK VIII.,"To let her know we see she's come,"
9014,BOOK VIII.,"And that, come when she will, 'tis proper"
9015,BOOK VIII.,For thinking men to think of supper.
9016,BOOK VIII.,"After we've eat our cheese and bread,"
9017,BOOK VIII.,Let all men see their horses fed;
9018,BOOK VIII.,For never was that ostler born
9019,BOOK VIII.,"That would not cheat 'em of their corn,"
9020,BOOK VIII.,Unless you keep a sharp look-out;
9021,BOOK VIII.,"And I, depend upon't, will do't."
9022,BOOK VIII.,"The town will send us in, of course,"
9023,BOOK VIII.,Both provender for man and horse;
9024,BOOK VIII.,"To stop our drunken knaves from sleeping,"
9025,BOOK VIII.,A thousand bonfires let us keep in:
9026,BOOK VIII.,"These fires will shine as bright as day,"
9027,BOOK VIII.,And then the Greeks can't run away:
9028,BOOK VIII.,"But if they do, the rogues shall find most"
9029,BOOK VIII.,Confounded doings for the hindmost;
9030,BOOK VIII.,"For, should they pop away i' th' dark,"
9031,BOOK VIII.,"We'll give 'em every man a mark,"
9032,BOOK VIII.,"Such as may last each man his life,"
9033,BOOK VIII.,"To show his roaring brats and wife,"
9034,BOOK VIII.,And warn the thieving sons of Tartars
9035,BOOK VIII.,How they again beat up our quarters.
9036,BOOK VIII.,"Next, to the town, if you think well,"
9037,BOOK VIII.,"We'll send the bellman with his bell,"
9038,BOOK VIII.,Who with his rusty voice may call
9039,BOOK VIII.,The hobbling watchmen to the wall:
9040,BOOK VIII.,"And, to prevent all needless frights,"
9041,BOOK VIII.,"Let the old women hang out lights,"
9042,BOOK VIII.,"Lest, while the shades of night are on us?"
9043,BOOK VIII.,"The Grecians steal a march upon us,"
9044,BOOK VIII.,"And, slily entering the town,"
9045,BOOK VIII.,Trim all our wives both up and down.
9046,BOOK VIII.,"To night these orders are enough,"
9047,BOOK VIII.,To-morrow we will work their buff:
9048,BOOK VIII.,I've a great notion that we may
9049,BOOK VIII.,"Drive these infernal rogues away,"
9050,BOOK VIII.,"Or tie the rascals to a stake fast,"
9051,BOOK VIII.,To give our dogs and cats a breakfast.
9052,BOOK VIII.,"Therefore this single night let's watch,"
9053,BOOK VIII.,"And, when the morning streaks you catch,"
9054,BOOK VIII.,"Get all the link-boys you can hire,"
9055,BOOK VIII.,And set their huts and boats on fire;
9056,BOOK VIII.,Then shall myself and Diomede
9057,BOOK VIII.,"Decide whose nose shall soonest bleed,"
9058,BOOK VIII.,"And whose propitious fate prevails,"
9059,BOOK VIII.,When weigh'd in Justice Cox's scales.
9060,BOOK VIII.,"Soon as to-morrow's dawn appears,"
9061,BOOK VIII.,I'll dust his cap about his ears;
9062,BOOK VIII.,"This good old stick shall crack his crown,"
9063,BOOK VIII.,And knock his rogues by dozens down:
9064,BOOK VIII.,"As sure as I perform this task,"
9065,BOOK VIII.,May I obtain whate'er I ask;
9066,BOOK VIII.,"With my lord-mayor to dine on Sundays,"
9067,BOOK VIII.,"Or common-council men on Mondays,"
9068,BOOK VIII.,"To cram my guts with tart and custard,"
9069,BOOK VIII.,"And goose with apple-sauce and mustard,"
9070,BOOK VIII.,"Or guttle down six pound of turtle,"
9071,BOOK VIII.,And drink the glorious and immortal:
9072,BOOK VIII.,"In joy thus eat, or fast in sorrow,"
9073,BOOK VIII.,As I shall drub the rogues to-morrow!
9074,BOOK VIII.,
9075,BOOK VIII.,"He ceas'd, and all the captains praise"
9076,BOOK VIII.,This noble speech with three huzzas.
9077,BOOK VIII.,After they'd loos'd from off the yoke
9078,BOOK VIII.,"The horses, wet with sweat and smoke,"
9079,BOOK VIII.,"And tied, to keep the nags apart,"
9080,BOOK VIII.,Each tit behind his owner's cart;
9081,BOOK VIII.,"Then came fat bacon from the town,"
9082,BOOK VIII.,"With bread (but ev'ry loaf was brown),"
9083,BOOK VIII.,"And a good stock of mild and stale,"
9084,BOOK VIII.,Though not one cask of Yorkshire ale:
9085,BOOK VIII.,The victuals they began to cook;
9086,BOOK VIII.,"But for their gods, to make a smoke,"
9087,BOOK VIII.,They bought some guts; but all that night
9088,BOOK VIII.,"Their godships had no appetite,"
9089,BOOK VIII.,"Puff'd the smoke from them in a sputter,"
9090,BOOK VIII.,And quarrel'd with their bread and butter.
9091,BOOK VIII.,"Juno, that fratching quean, pretended"
9092,BOOK VIII.,Her sense of smelling was offended:
9093,BOOK VIII.,"Jove said he felt a queerish funk,"
9094,BOOK VIII.,And Pallas swore the guts all stunk.
9095,BOOK VIII.,"Thus did Troy find, to all their cost,"
9096,BOOK VIII.,"A very handsome supper lost,"
9097,BOOK VIII.,"Though their great courage did not droop,"

9237,BOOK IX.,At length he spoke: Good lack-a-day!
9238,BOOK IX.,In these hard times what can we say?
9239,BOOK IX.,"Of Jove we all complain with justice,"
9240,BOOK IX.,For in his royal word no trust is:
9241,BOOK IX.,The oracles of wise Apollo
9242,BOOK IX.,Have likewise been a little hollow;
9243,BOOK IX.,"Betwixt 'em both we're finely nick'd,"
9244,BOOK IX.,And get most tightly thump'd and kick'd:
9245,BOOK IX.,"They promis'd we our fobs should cram,"
9246,BOOK IX.,But now you see 'tis all a flam;
9247,BOOK IX.,"For Jove, if ever he design'd"

9249,BOOK IX.,"Although so much concern he feels,"
9250,BOOK IX.,He gives us leave to trust our heels.
9251,BOOK IX.,Therefore I vote that ev'ry man
9252,BOOK IX.,"Trot home as fast as e'er he can,"
9253,BOOK IX.,Nor hope that we shall e'er destroy
9254,BOOK IX.,"This heaven-defended whore's-nest, Troy."
9255,BOOK IX.,
9256,BOOK IX.,He spoke: and each bold Grecian son
9257,BOOK IX.,"Look'd as he'd neither lost nor won,"
9258,BOOK IX.,But gaping stood; till Diomede
9259,BOOK IX.,"Began to speak, and speak he did:"
9260,BOOK IX.,
9261,BOOK IX.,"You told me, Sir, I late begun"
9262,BOOK IX.,"To fight, but rot me if I run!"
9263,BOOK IX.,"No cause of quarrel Diom. seeks,"
9264,BOOK IX.,But we are lost if no man speaks:
9265,BOOK IX.,"You bawl'd so loud, though I was near you,"

9267,BOOK IX.,"Though then I thought it good to wink on't,"
9268,BOOK IX.,"Seal up my day-lights, but I'll think on't!"
9269,BOOK IX.,"Great Jove, whose power all power surpasses,"
9270,BOOK IX.,Who makes great men of calves and asses:Witness
9271,BOOK IX.,"the English h---- of p----,"
9272,BOOK IX.,And c----s too of later years;
9273,BOOK IX.,"Witness the ministers of ----,"
9274,BOOK IX.,And privy c----s of late;
9275,BOOK IX.,Witness their treaties with the French;
9276,BOOK IX.,Witness their j----s on the bench;
9277,BOOK IX.,"Witness their bishops, priests, and deacons,"
9278,BOOK IX.,"All pious souls, but very weak ones;"
9279,BOOK IX.,"Witness their justices of peace,"
9280,BOOK IX.,And lawyers too:--but let me cease
9281,BOOK IX.,"To chatter more this kind of stuff,"
9282,BOOK IX.,I think there's witnesses enough:
9283,BOOK IX.,"So to my text, as parsons say;"
9284,BOOK IX.,"The gods, when they mix'd up thy clay,"
9285,BOOK IX.,"Put half and half, and let thee pass"
9286,BOOK IX.,"Half a great booby, half an ass;"
9287,BOOK IX.,But I am sure they could not then
9288,BOOK IX.,"Design thee to command brave men,"
9289,BOOK IX.,Because to give thee they thought fit
9290,BOOK IX.,A soul no bigger than a nit!
9291,BOOK IX.,"Would any bold commander, pray,"
9292,BOOK IX.,Persuade his rogues to run away?
9293,BOOK IX.,And then 'tis ten to one you'll swear
9294,BOOK IX.,The raggamuffins ran for fear.
9295,BOOK IX.,You and your sneaking crew may run;
9296,BOOK IX.,"But take my word, since I've begun"
9297,BOOK IX.,"To kick and cuff, you may depend on't"
9298,BOOK IX.,"I'll tarry here, and see the end on't."
9299,BOOK IX.,"Then don't this fair occasion slip,"
9300,BOOK IX.,But get on board thy rotten ship;
9301,BOOK IX.,"The rest, I hope, will scorn to mog off,"
9302,BOOK IX.,"And dim my day-lights if I'll jog off,"
9303,BOOK IX.,"But stay to fire yon whoring town,"
9304,BOOK IX.,And pull their barns and cocklofts down
9305,BOOK IX.,But if they all should choose to fly.
9306,BOOK IX.,"Stenny will stay, and so will I."
9307,BOOK IX.,"When once I've enter'd, know I am"
9308,BOOK IX.,"As steady as a Rockingham,"
9309,BOOK IX.,Whose country's cause will ever be
9310,BOOK IX.,His object to eternity.
9311,BOOK IX.,"Like him I'll knaves and fools oppose,"
9312,BOOK IX.,But join both heart and hand with those
9313,BOOK IX.,Whose words as well as actions show
9314,BOOK IX.,They love their king and country too:
9315,BOOK IX.,"In such a cause I'll never flinch,"
9316,BOOK IX.,And smite me if I stir an inch!
9317,BOOK IX.,"With heaven we came when we begun,"
9318,BOOK IX.,And hell itself sha'n't make us run.
9319,BOOK IX.,
9320,BOOK IX.,He ended here; and all the crowd
9321,BOOK IX.,"Began to shout so very loud,"
9322,BOOK IX.,You'd think each man would burst his liver
9323,BOOK IX.,"With roaring, Diomede for ever!"
9324,BOOK IX.,When up the rev'rend figure rear'd
9325,BOOK IX.,"Of chatt'ring Nestor's grizzle beard,"
9326,BOOK IX.,And spoke; the chiefs all silent sit
9327,BOOK IX.,As members when they're humm'd by Pitt
9328,BOOK IX.,
9329,BOOK IX.,"Thus he begins: My trusty knight,"
9330,BOOK IX.,"Stick to your text, by G-- you're right!"
9331,BOOK IX.,"I like a man that never starves it,"
9332,BOOK IX.,"But blames king George, if he deserves it;"
9333,BOOK IX.,And yet before you gave it o'er
9334,BOOK IX.,You might have said a little more:
9335,BOOK IX.,"I'll speak, nor do I think the thing"
9336,BOOK IX.,Will vex the people or the king.
9337,BOOK IX.,Damnation seize and overtake
9338,BOOK IX.,The man that fights for fighting's sake!
9339,BOOK IX.,"Such rogues the world would over-run,"
9340,BOOK IX.,And break good people's heads for fun;
9341,BOOK IX.,"But we, though under feet we're trod,"
9342,BOOK IX.,"Have justice on our side, by G-d!"
9343,BOOK IX.,"Therefore to-night let sentries watch us,"
9344,BOOK IX.,Lest these confounded rascals catch us
9345,BOOK IX.,All fast asleep. But first 'tis proper
9346,BOOK IX.,To give these sentinels some supper:
9347,BOOK IX.,"Then thou, whose pow'r no man controls,"
9348,BOOK IX.,To council call the grave old souls;
9349,BOOK IX.,"Before the bus'ness you begin,"
9350,BOOK IX.,Give each old buff a dram of gin;
9351,BOOK IX.,"'Twill cheer their hearts, with age quite shrunk,"
9352,BOOK IX.,But don't you make th' old firelocks drunk;
9353,BOOK IX.,For counsel good no honest fellow
9354,BOOK IX.,"Can give, if he is more than mellow:"
9355,BOOK IX.,With mod'rate share of meat and drink
9356,BOOK IX.,"They'll freely chatter what they think,"
9357,BOOK IX.,"And, like a City congregation"
9358,BOOK IX.,"Who meet sometimes for the good o' th' nation,"
9359,BOOK IX.,"Some one, before the close of night,"
9360,BOOK IX.,May blunder on a thing that's right.
9361,BOOK IX.,See but yon Trojan fires so near us!
9362,BOOK IX.,"If we but sneeze, they overhear us;"
9363,BOOK IX.,"Whilst then so nigh our boats they keep,"
9364,BOOK IX.,The devil fetch me if I'll sleep!
9365,BOOK IX.,"To-morrow morn begins the jumble,"
9366,BOOK IX.,"Where Troy must fall, or Greece must tumble."
9367,BOOK IX.,
9368,BOOK IX.,'Twas thus old Grey-beard spoke; and straight
9369,BOOK IX.,Each sentry posted to his gate:
9370,BOOK IX.,"The son[1] the father first obey'd,"
9371,BOOK IX.,To show he minded what he said:
9372,BOOK IX.,(For in those times a son would do
9373,BOOK IX.,Things that are out of fashion now):
9374,BOOK IX.,"Ascalaphus, the son of Mars,"
9375,BOOK IX.,"Follow'd this hero hard at a--e,"
9376,BOOK IX.,"Along with bold Ialmen, who"
9377,BOOK IX.,Was bully Mars's bastard too;
9378,BOOK IX.,Merion and Diepyrus
9379,BOOK IX.,"Went next, and then Aphereus;"
9380,BOOK IX.,"Last came the valiant Lycomede,"
9381,BOOK IX.,A hardy whelp of Creon's breed.
9382,BOOK IX.,"Twice fifty constables, all knaves,"
9383,BOOK IX.,Guarded each bully with their staves;
9384,BOOK IX.,"Not one durst sit upon his crupper,"
9385,BOOK IX.,But standing mump'd his crust for supper.
9386,BOOK IX.,"The chief, both hungry and afraid,"
9387,BOOK IX.,Had in his tent a supper made;
9388,BOOK IX.,"Though matters wore no pleasing looks,"
9389,BOOK IX.,He had not yet discharg'd his cooks;
9390,BOOK IX.,"'Tis true, he oft had thought upon"
9391,BOOK IX.,"A proper reformation,"
9392,BOOK IX.,And taken good advice from all but
9393,BOOK IX.,"The very man he should, L--d T----t,"
9394,BOOK IX.,"Who soon would bring that scheme to pass,"
9395,BOOK IX.,And send his drunken cooks to grass.
9396,BOOK IX.,But as there's nought on earth can look
9397,BOOK IX.,"So dismal as a half-starv'd cook,"
9398,BOOK IX.,"I hope, for these poor devils' sake,"
9399,BOOK IX.,"He won't such sneaking methods take,"
9400,BOOK IX.,But let each honest red-nos'd cook
9401,BOOK IX.,"Die, as he's liv'd, in fire and smoke."
9402,BOOK IX.,
9403,BOOK IX.,All the old cocks were bidden to
9404,BOOK IX.,"This melancholy supper, who"
9405,BOOK IX.,Were capable at this bad bout
9406,BOOK IX.,By good advice to help them out:
9407,BOOK IX.,"They ate a deal, but drank much more,"
9408,BOOK IX.,Nor stopp'd till they were half-seas o'er;
9409,BOOK IX.,"Nestor, who on this weighty summons"
9410,BOOK IX.,(Like speakers in the house of c------s)
9411,BOOK IX.,"First penn'd a speech, then got it off,"
9412,BOOK IX.,"Began to hawk, and spit, and cough,"
9413,BOOK IX.,"Then spoke: Thou monarch, who, in troth,"
9414,BOOK IX.,Exceed'st the kings of Brentford both!
9415,BOOK IX.,"Thou powerful chief, bedeck'd with ermine,"
9416,BOOK IX.,"Who, as thy fancy shall determine,"
9417,BOOK IX.,"Canst pull down men, and set up vermin,"
9418,BOOK IX.,"A thing you did some time ago,"
9419,BOOK IX.,To show the folks what you could do
9420,BOOK IX.,Upon a pinch; but if again
9421,BOOK IX.,"You do it, Nestor tells you plain"
9422,BOOK IX.,"All honest men will so resent it,"
9423,BOOK IX.,They'll give you reason to repent it.
9424,BOOK IX.,"Though you are honest we are sure,"
9425,BOOK IX.,"Yet if you give to rascals power,"
9426,BOOK IX.,The wrongs you suffer them to do
9427,BOOK IX.,"Will all be justly laid on you,"
9428,BOOK IX.,"And, spite of all that you can say for't,"
9429,BOOK IX.,The folks at last will make you pay for't.
9430,BOOK IX.,In matters of this kind you'll find me
9431,BOOK IX.,"Much older than yourself, so mind me;"
9432,BOOK IX.,Cares that o'erload my upper shelf
9433,BOOK IX.,"Belong to you, and not myself;"
9434,BOOK IX.,"In weighty matters don't be nice,"
9435,BOOK IX.,But always jump at good advice:
9436,BOOK IX.,"Though I'm the man of sense to make it,"
9437,BOOK IX.,"Yet if you've sense enough to take it,"
9438,BOOK IX.,The gaping crowd will all agree
9439,BOOK IX.,That you're as wise a man as me:
9440,BOOK IX.,"To seem exceeding wise, we know,"
9441,BOOK IX.,Is half as good as being so.
9442,BOOK IX.,A noodle with a well-tim'd shrug
9443,BOOK IX.,May any time the world humbug;
9444,BOOK IX.,"Then hear me, for I'll utter nought"
9445,BOOK IX.,"But what I think, and always thought:"
9446,BOOK IX.,"I told you, when you made such gabbling,"
9447,BOOK IX.,"When Thetis' son and you were squabbling,"
9448,BOOK IX.,"And like two blackguard scoundrels swore,"
9449,BOOK IX.,"And curs'd, and damn'd about a whore,"
9450,BOOK IX.,"That through my spectacles I saw,"
9451,BOOK IX.,"Like Winchelsea, how things would go;"
9452,BOOK IX.,"I saw the bully would resent it,"
9453,BOOK IX.,And told you who would first repent it;
9454,BOOK IX.,And to your cost you find out now
9455,BOOK IX.,I told you nought but what was true.
9456,BOOK IX.,"But as that matter's done and o'er,"
9457,BOOK IX.,"And can't be help'd, I'll say no more:"
9458,BOOK IX.,The man's a puppy that begins
9459,BOOK IX.,To kick his neighbour's broken shins;
9460,BOOK IX.,Only 'tis time you strive to please him:
9461,BOOK IX.,"You vex'd him, and you must appease him."
9462,BOOK IX.,
9463,BOOK IX.,"The chief then answers to the knight,"
9464,BOOK IX.,"Flux me, old buff, but you are right!"
9465,BOOK IX.,"I see as plain as in a glass,"
9466,BOOK IX.,You're a wise man and I'm an ass.
9467,BOOK IX.,Too late I find that great strong elf
9468,BOOK IX.,Is half an army of himself;
9469,BOOK IX.,"For him, that water-witch his mother"
9470,BOOK IX.,Drives us on heaps o'er one another:
9471,BOOK IX.,"Fain would I alter what I've done,"
9472,BOOK IX.,And strive to please both witch and son:
9473,BOOK IX.,"A bribe must fetch him, or he can,"
9474,BOOK IX.,"I'll take my oath, be no great man;"
9475,BOOK IX.,For never yet of all that tribe
9476,BOOK IX.,Could any one resist a bribe.
9477,BOOK IX.,"A star and riband, or a pension,"
9478,BOOK IX.,Will overset the best intention;
9479,BOOK IX.,"Make patriots, like the courtiers, civil,"
9480,BOOK IX.,And sell their country to the devil.
9481,BOOK IX.,"Therefore, bear witness all around,"
9482,BOOK IX.,"I hereby offer him ten pound,"
9483,BOOK IX.,"Seven iron pans to boil his fish in,"
9484,BOOK IX.,And twenty chamber-pots to piss in;
9485,BOOK IX.,"I'll likewise add a dozen nags,"
9486,BOOK IX.,That soon will fill his empty bags
9487,BOOK IX.,"By winning plates; not one is idle,"
9488,BOOK IX.,But ev'ry horse has won his bridle--
9489,BOOK IX.,"Nay, some have won a saddle too--"
9490,BOOK IX.,But of that sort there's very few.
9491,BOOK IX.,"Their pedigrees are all so good,"
9492,BOOK IX.,That few their equals are in blood:
9493,BOOK IX.,"Out of the twelve, he'll find eleven"
9494,BOOK IX.,"Have got a ring-bone or a spawn,"
9495,BOOK IX.,Which is the surest sign indeed
9496,BOOK IX.,They're of the very tip-top breed.
9497,BOOK IX.,"Besides, I'll give him seven wenches,"
9498,BOOK IX.,"With fists so hard, they've kept their trenches"
9499,BOOK IX.,From being storm'd; if any clown
9500,BOOK IX.,"Offer'd to touch, they'd knock him down--"
9501,BOOK IX.,'Twould do him good if he would stop
9502,BOOK IX.,"And see how well they twirl a mop,"
9503,BOOK IX.,"And spin so fine, they weekly earn"
9504,BOOK IX.,Their sixteen pence in spinning yarn--
9505,BOOK IX.,"All these I'll give him out and out,"
9506,BOOK IX.,And add the wench we fratch'd about;
9507,BOOK IX.,"For his broad back doth so bewitch her,"
9508,BOOK IX.,She never yet would let me switch her.
9509,BOOK IX.,"Besides all this, when we have taken"
9510,BOOK IX.,"The town, with all their eggs and bacon,"
9511,BOOK IX.,"Of guttling stuff he shall have store,"
9512,BOOK IX.,Besides full twenty wenches more;
9513,BOOK IX.,"Himself shall be the first who chooses,"
9514,BOOK IX.,And what on trial he refuses
9515,BOOK IX.,We'll take ourselves; then he shall go
9516,BOOK IX.,"To Greece, and be my son-in-law;"
9517,BOOK IX.,"The farm that I have under care,"
9518,BOOK IX.,Orestes and himself shall share:
9519,BOOK IX.,"Lastly, three daughters I can boast,"
9520,BOOK IX.,"All taught to bake, and boil, and roast;"
9521,BOOK IX.,"Girls, that, besides plain-work and stitching,"
9522,BOOK IX.,"Can do the business of the kitchen,"
9523,BOOK IX.,"Can make a pudding or a pie,"
9524,BOOK IX.,Or toss you up a lambstone fry;
9525,BOOK IX.,"Laodice and Iphigene,"
9526,BOOK IX.,Two tighter girls are seldom seen;
9527,BOOK IX.,In the sun's rays there not a beam is
9528,BOOK IX.,So bright as red-hair'd Chrysothemis;
9529,BOOK IX.,"All three are dev'lish sprightly jades,"
9530,BOOK IX.,And sore against their will are maids.
9531,BOOK IX.,"These in their Sunday's yard-wide stuff,"
9532,BOOK IX.,"Or, if he pleases, dress'd in buff,"
9533,BOOK IX.,"I'll let him see to take his choice,"
9534,BOOK IX.,"Like which he will, he has my voice;"
9535,BOOK IX.,And for her portion I'll give more
9536,BOOK IX.,Than ****** spends upon his whore;
9537,BOOK IX.,The mayor of Garrat shall not be
9538,BOOK IX.,So great a man by half as he;
9539,BOOK IX.,"Because, those mighty gifts to crown,"
9540,BOOK IX.,"I'll make him bailiff of a town,"
9541,BOOK IX.,With six fine villages about it--
9542,BOOK IX.,"And keep my word, he need not doubt it."
9543,BOOK IX.,"He shall command Enope's people,"
9544,BOOK IX.,And Cardamyle without a steeple;
9545,BOOK IX.,"Pherag and Pedasus, whose trees"
9546,BOOK IX.,"Produce so many gooseberries,"
9547,BOOK IX.,That I am told they yearly bottle
9548,BOOK IX.,"No less than fifteen hundred pottle,"
9549,BOOK IX.,And every pottle in the year
9550,BOOK IX.,Brings them at least five farthings clear;
9551,BOOK IX.,"Hira's good pastures and Epea,"
9552,BOOK IX.,"And special fields about Anthea,"
9553,BOOK IX.,Where all the farmers fill their purses
9554,BOOK IX.,By grazing brewers' founder'd horses:--
9555,BOOK IX.,"These, standing on the salt-sea beach,"
9556,BOOK IX.,"Almost as far as Pylos reach,"
9557,BOOK IX.,"Where bulls, and cows, and oxen roar,"
9558,BOOK IX.,"And men get drunk, and women whore.--"
9559,BOOK IX.,"See what I offer to appease him,"
9560,BOOK IX.,The devil's in't if this don't please him:
9561,BOOK IX.,"By pray'rs the hardest thing relaxes,"
9562,BOOK IX.,"Nothing stands fix'd, but death and taxes."
9563,BOOK IX.,
9564,BOOK IX.,"Nestor, whose silence gave him pain,"
9565,BOOK IX.,Starts up to chatter once again:
9566,BOOK IX.,"Now, by my soul, 'tis bravely offer'd!"
9567,BOOK IX.,Singe my old beard if I'd have proffer'd
9568,BOOK IX.,'Bove half as much! This must convince
9569,BOOK IX.,The man that you're a noble prince.
9570,BOOK IX.,"And now we've talk'd the matter fully,"
9571,BOOK IX.,Let's send and tell this stiff-rump'd bully
9572,BOOK IX.,Your princely offer; I will warrant
9573,BOOK IX.,"To find men proper for the errand,"
9574,BOOK IX.,"Men that can strut it, and look big,"
9575,BOOK IX.,With store of guts as well as wig.
9576,BOOK IX.,"In such-like cases, when we can,"
9577,BOOK IX.,We mostly send an alderman;
9578,BOOK IX.,But since none came in our old lighters
9579,BOOK IX.,"(Few aldermen, God knows, are fighters),"
9580,BOOK IX.,"We'll send some people in their places,"
9581,BOOK IX.,With aldermanic guts and faces.
9582,BOOK IX.,"There's Phœnix, like myself, grown wise,"
9583,BOOK IX.,He knows the use of well-plac'd lies;
9584,BOOK IX.,"Then Ajax, with a head so big,"
9585,BOOK IX.,"If we can fit him with a wig,"
9586,BOOK IX.,"He'll quickly make Achilles stare,"
9587,BOOK IX.,And think we've sent my good lord-mayor.
9588,BOOK IX.,But I'm afraid we cannot get him
9589,BOOK IX.,A busby large enough to fit him;
9590,BOOK IX.,"Because, when we set out, I know,"
9591,BOOK IX.,"He look'd all over Middle-Row,"
9592,BOOK IX.,"But could not find one, up or down,"
9593,BOOK IX.,Half deep enough to fit his crown;
9594,BOOK IX.,Which is the cause he's forc'd to wear
9595,BOOK IX.,His old thrum night-cap all the year.
9596,BOOK IX.,"Ulysses too, to mend the job,"
9597,BOOK IX.,Must help 'em with his fudging nob:
9598,BOOK IX.,He'll tell more lies for half a crown
9599,BOOK IX.,Than any shopkeeper in town.
9600,BOOK IX.,"And then, to close the farce, and make"
9601,BOOK IX.,"It look like bus'ness, let 'em take"
9602,BOOK IX.,"Two beadles with their brass-nobb'd staves,"
9603,BOOK IX.,I hate to see things done by halves.
9604,BOOK IX.,"When they are gone, let us prepare"
9605,BOOK IX.,To whisper every man a prayer:
9606,BOOK IX.,"But do not let the Trojans hear,"
9607,BOOK IX.,Lest they should think we pray for fear;
9608,BOOK IX.,"Though, if they can but nose it well,"
9609,BOOK IX.,They'll guess our pickle by the smell.
9610,BOOK IX.,
9611,BOOK IX.,"And now, as usual, his oration"
9612,BOOK IX.,Receiv'd a gen'ral approbation:
9613,BOOK IX.,The messengers soon left their places;
9614,BOOK IX.,"But first they wash'd their dirty faces,"
9615,BOOK IX.,And with an old tin dredging-box
9616,BOOK IX.,"Scatter'd some meal upon their locks,"
9617,BOOK IX.,Then from a swinging pitcher full
9618,BOOK IX.,Of ale each took a hearty pull.
9619,BOOK IX.,Now Nestor had a sort of dread
9620,BOOK IX.,This ale might get into their head;
9621,BOOK IX.,"And they, perhaps, might chatter then"
9622,BOOK IX.,"Like drunken common-council men,"
9623,BOOK IX.,"And tell the king to whom they're sent,"
9624,BOOK IX.,"They came to pay a compliment,"
9625,BOOK IX.,But end their message with a spice
9626,BOOK IX.,Of drunken hickuping advice;
9627,BOOK IX.,"So follow'd of his own accord,"
9628,BOOK IX.,And begg'd that not one angry word
9629,BOOK IX.,"Might 'scape their jaws, and that Ulyss,"
9630,BOOK IX.,"Whose roguish tricks did seldom miss,"
9631,BOOK IX.,"Would see the greatest care was taken,"
9632,BOOK IX.,In this great strait to save their bacon.
9633,BOOK IX.,
9634,BOOK IX.,"Away they trudg'd in dreadful plight,"
9635,BOOK IX.,Because it was so dark a night
9636,BOOK IX.,They could not see a spark of light;
9637,BOOK IX.,But they could hear the billows roar
9638,BOOK IX.,"As they came rumbling on the shore,"
9639,BOOK IX.,"Which made 'em, whilst their way they kept"
9640,BOOK IX.,Lug out a prayer or two to Neptune:
9641,BOOK IX.,"Neptune, quoth they, we all could wish"
9642,BOOK IX.,That you would help us to a dish
9643,BOOK IX.,"Of sprats or smelts, or any fish,"
9644,BOOK IX.,"Or, what will likeliest do the thing,"
9645,BOOK IX.,A little handful of old ling;
9646,BOOK IX.,For that's an article will melt
9647,BOOK IX.,"A judge's heart, unless he's gelt."
9648,BOOK IX.,"But they might pray, and pray, and pray,"
9649,BOOK IX.,Neptune was out of luck that day;
9650,BOOK IX.,"Though he had fish'd from morn to night,"
9651,BOOK IX.,He had not got a single bite;
9652,BOOK IX.,Nor (should their souls depend on that)
9653,BOOK IX.,"Could he assist them with a sprat,"
9654,BOOK IX.,"Or e'en a shrimp; but as for ling,"
9655,BOOK IX.,Th' old fisherman had no such thing:
9656,BOOK IX.,"As fast as honest Neptune cur'd it,"
9657,BOOK IX.,"That whoring rogue, that Jove, secur'd it;"
9658,BOOK IX.,"For, though a god in ev'ry thing,"
9659,BOOK IX.,He was a devil at old ling.
9660,BOOK IX.,"But be that matter as it may,"
9661,BOOK IX.,By great good luck they grop'd their way
9662,BOOK IX.,"When they came near this son of Mars,"
9663,BOOK IX.,"They saw him sitting on his a---,"
9664,BOOK IX.,"Making such ugly faces, that"
9665,BOOK IX.,They thought him grinning for a hat;
9666,BOOK IX.,"But he, good man, upon his rump,"
9667,BOOK IX.,"Was playing on a brass jew-trump,"
9668,BOOK IX.,"And 'cause the music pleas'd him much,"
9669,BOOK IX.,He gap'd and grinn'd at ev'ry touch;
9670,BOOK IX.,"Only Patroclus tarried near him,"
9671,BOOK IX.,No mortal else would stay to hear him--
9672,BOOK IX.,"Rather than stay to hear him play,"
9673,BOOK IX.,The very rats were run away.
9674,BOOK IX.,
9675,BOOK IX.,Just in the middle of his airs
9676,BOOK IX.,They stole upon him unawares;
9677,BOOK IX.,"But, when he peep'd and saw them come,"
9678,BOOK IX.,"He whipp'd him up from off his bum,"
9679,BOOK IX.,"And clapp'd the trump into his pocket,"
9680,BOOK IX.,"So quick, Ulysses thinks he broke it:"
9681,BOOK IX.,"Patroclus too was on his rump,"
9682,BOOK IX.,And like him gave a sudden jump:
9683,BOOK IX.,"Achilles seiz'd 'em by their hands,"
9684,BOOK IX.,And begg'd to know their best commands:
9685,BOOK IX.,
9686,BOOK IX.,"Welcome, old friends, to me yet dear!"
9687,BOOK IX.,"Pray, what the devil brought you here?"
9688,BOOK IX.,"If you are come to me for help,"
9689,BOOK IX.,"From that infernal noisy whelp,"
9690,BOOK IX.,"And hither trudg'd to ask my aid,"
9691,BOOK IX.,You must be hellishly afraid;
9692,BOOK IX.,"And that ye are, I need not tell ye,"
9693,BOOK IX.,"Because, to speak the truth, I smell ye."
9694,BOOK IX.,
9695,BOOK IX.,"[Illustration: Book IX, page 149."
9696,BOOK IX.,"Achilles seiz'd them by their hands,"
9697,BOOK IX.,And begg'd to know their best commands:
9698,BOOK IX.,"Welcome, old friends, to me yet dear!"
9699,BOOK IX.,"Pray, what the devil brought you here?]"
9700,BOOK IX.,
9701,BOOK IX.,At this he pointed to his tent;
9702,BOOK IX.,"They made a leg, and in they went,"
9703,BOOK IX.,"Where down the heroes clapp'd their docks,"
9704,BOOK IX.,On woollen cushions stuff'd with flocks;
9705,BOOK IX.,
9706,BOOK IX.,"Patroclus, says Achilles, you"
9707,BOOK IX.,"Must know, of all the Grecian crew"
9708,BOOK IX.,I like these cocks; so do not fail
9709,BOOK IX.,To get a pot of mild and stale
9710,BOOK IX.,Of Dolly Pumplenose and tell her
9711,BOOK IX.,To send the best in all the cellar.
9712,BOOK IX.,
9713,BOOK IX.,"Patroclus ran and fetch'd the beer,"
9714,BOOK IX.,And then prepar'd for better cheer:
9715,BOOK IX.,"With a cow-heel he first began,"
9716,BOOK IX.,And fry'd it in an old brass pan;
9717,BOOK IX.,"But first he soak'd an offal piece,"
9718,BOOK IX.,To suck up all the verdigrise--
9719,BOOK IX.,"Had he not ta'en such care, he might"
9720,BOOK IX.,Have poison'd all his friends outright;
9721,BOOK IX.,Because from hist'ry it appears
9722,BOOK IX.,The pan had not been us'd some years.
9723,BOOK IX.,"Automedon soon fetch'd a candle,"
9724,BOOK IX.,"Then held the frying-pan by th' handle,"
9725,BOOK IX.,Whilst great Achilles fell to work
9726,BOOK IX.,To cut some steaks of beef and pork:
9727,BOOK IX.,"Patroclus, at his friend's desire,"
9728,BOOK IX.,"Made what we call a roaring fire,"
9729,BOOK IX.,"At which the steaks were nicely cook'd,"
9730,BOOK IX.,Except a few a little smok'd;
9731,BOOK IX.,Though his sharp hungry guests would not
9732,BOOK IX.,"Believe 'em smok'd, but smoking hot."
9733,BOOK IX.,For table-cloth Pelides spread
9734,BOOK IX.,A sheet he took from off his bed;
9735,BOOK IX.,Then gave each man a cake of bread;
9736,BOOK IX.,"And, that the gods might have their due,"
9737,BOOK IX.,The fat into the fire he threw:
9738,BOOK IX.,"For heathen gods, if you'll inquire,"
9739,BOOK IX.,Are pleas'd when all the fat's i' th' fire.
9740,BOOK IX.,
9741,BOOK IX.,"Then they fell on their meat and cakes,"
9742,BOOK IX.,And gobbled up the heel and steaks.
9743,BOOK IX.,"After they'd ta'en some time to drink,"
9744,BOOK IX.,To Phœnix Ajax tipp'd the wink;
9745,BOOK IX.,Ulysses soon the signal spies
9746,BOOK IX.,"(For he kept watch with both his eyes),"
9747,BOOK IX.,"Then pours a glass of ale by stealth,"
9748,BOOK IX.,"And cries, Achilles, Sir, your health,"
9749,BOOK IX.,"With forty thousand thanks, d'ye see,"
9750,BOOK IX.,For this your kind civility:
9751,BOOK IX.,"Great Agamemnon, smite my crupper!"
9752,BOOK IX.,Could not have cook'd a better supper.
9753,BOOK IX.,"But, though you've fill'd our skins so full"
9754,BOOK IX.,"Of meat and drink, yet still we're dull,"
9755,BOOK IX.,"Because the day is hardly pass'd,"
9756,BOOK IX.,That saw us all so tightly thrash'd;
9757,BOOK IX.,And now we stand upon the brink
9758,BOOK IX.,"Of ruin, and shall surely sink"
9759,BOOK IX.,"If you don't come, for I'm mistaken"
9760,BOOK IX.,"If aught alive can save our bacon,"
9761,BOOK IX.,"Unless you kindly will assist,"
9762,BOOK IX.,And let 'em feel your mutton fist.
9763,BOOK IX.,"Peep out, you'll see the Trojans keep"
9764,BOOK IX.,Us all coop'd up like Smithfield sheep;
9765,BOOK IX.,"They talk of singeing all our tails,"
9766,BOOK IX.,And burning both our masts and sails:
9767,BOOK IX.,"Great Jove himself, or else the devil,"
9768,BOOK IX.,"Has been so very kind and civil,"
9769,BOOK IX.,"As box all day on Hector's side,"
9770,BOOK IX.,And lend him strength to trim our hide--
9771,BOOK IX.,"That Hector who the world defies,"
9772,BOOK IX.,And carries lightning in his eyes;
9773,BOOK IX.,"His stomach is so full of ire,"
9774,BOOK IX.,That when he rifts he belches fire;
9775,BOOK IX.,We heard him plain his comrades tell
9776,BOOK IX.,"I' th' morn he'll ring our passing-bell,"
9777,BOOK IX.,And send both men and boats to hell:
9778,BOOK IX.,"It gave me such a twitch o' th' gripes,"
9779,BOOK IX.,"To see the rascal deal his stripes,"
9780,BOOK IX.,"I've hardly got quite clear on't yet,"
9781,BOOK IX.,"And still I'm in a reeking sweat,"
9782,BOOK IX.,"Lest he to-morrow morn come out,"
9783,BOOK IX.,And once more kick us all about.
9784,BOOK IX.,Is it not very hard we must
9785,BOOK IX.,"Lay all our nobs in Trojan dust,"
9786,BOOK IX.,Because at present you don't list
9787,BOOK IX.,To help us with your clumsy fist?
9788,BOOK IX.,"But, dear Achilles, now or never"
9789,BOOK IX.,"Jump up, and smite that Hector's liver,"
9790,BOOK IX.,And you'll oblige your friends for ever:
9791,BOOK IX.,"But if you let us all be slain,"
9792,BOOK IX.,"Sink me, if e'er we fight again!"
9793,BOOK IX.,"No steps, my friend, that you can tread"
9794,BOOK IX.,Will help us when we're knock'd o' th' head;
9795,BOOK IX.,"Therefore in time observe, I pray,"
9796,BOOK IX.,What your old daddy us'd to say:
9797,BOOK IX.,"My son, said he, and strok'd thy locks,"
9798,BOOK IX.,Thou'rt strong enough to fell an ox;
9799,BOOK IX.,"But, for all that, keep clear of brabbling,"
9800,BOOK IX.,"Or else you'll get a name for squabbling,"
9801,BOOK IX.,"And then, depend, high words and high blows"
9802,BOOK IX.,Will bring you nought but kicks and dry blows;
9803,BOOK IX.,But quiet dealings and good nature
9804,BOOK IX.,"Will please folks so, that ev'ry creature"
9805,BOOK IX.,"Will say, in spite of your thick jowl,"
9806,BOOK IX.,'Tis a good-natur'd honest soul.
9807,BOOK IX.,"But, in your wrath, if you perhaps"
9808,BOOK IX.,"Should lend a man a slap o' th' chaps,"
9809,BOOK IX.,Your mutton fist will bruise his jaw
9810,BOOK IX.,"(Remember that I told you so),"
9811,BOOK IX.,"For which, if you don't run away,"
9812,BOOK IX.,You'll have the surgeon's bill to pay.
9813,BOOK IX.,If any blust'ring son of Mars
9814,BOOK IX.,"Affront you, bid him kiss your a---!"
9815,BOOK IX.,"Whether he tarries then or goes off,"
9816,BOOK IX.,"Don't strike him, lest you knock his nose off."
9817,BOOK IX.,"Pray do not, like a graceless knave,"
9818,BOOK IX.,Despise th' advice your daddy gave;
9819,BOOK IX.,"But, if you'll grant Atrides' prayer,"
9820,BOOK IX.,"He'll give you--stop, and you shall hear"
9821,BOOK IX.,What a great gainer you'll be by't;
9822,BOOK IX.,I have it down in black and white:
9823,BOOK IX.,"Before the elders seated round,"
9824,BOOK IX.,"He nobly offers you ten pound,"
9825,BOOK IX.,"Seven iron pans to boil your fish in,"
9826,BOOK IX.,And twenty chamber-pots to piss in;
9827,BOOK IX.,"He'll likewise add a dozen nags,"
9828,BOOK IX.,"That soon will fill your empty bags,"
9829,BOOK IX.,"By winning plates; they ha'n't been idle,"
9830,BOOK IX.,"But ev'ry nag has won his bridle,"
9831,BOOK IX.,"Nay, some have won a saddle too,"
9832,BOOK IX.,But of that sort there's very few;
9833,BOOK IX.,"Their pedigrees are all so good,"
9834,BOOK IX.,That few their equals are in blood;
9835,BOOK IX.,Out of the twelve you'll find eleven
9836,BOOK IX.,"Have got a ring-bone or a spavin,"
9837,BOOK IX.,Which is the surest sign indeed
9838,BOOK IX.,They're of the very tip-top breed:
9839,BOOK IX.,For sev'ral of 'em you may trace
9840,BOOK IX.,From that fam'd horse that won the race.
9841,BOOK IX.,"For great Darius, when the state"
9842,BOOK IX.,Decreed a kingdom for a plate;
9843,BOOK IX.,"And, if you sell them, Pond for you"
9844,BOOK IX.,Shall swear the pedigree is true.
9845,BOOK IX.,"Besides all this, he'll throw you in,"
9846,BOOK IX.,"Of hard-bumm'd wenches that can spin,"
9847,BOOK IX.,"The very lucky number seven,"
9848,BOOK IX.,Odd numbers always beat the even;
9849,BOOK IX.,"Their spinning will good money earn,"
9850,BOOK IX.,And you'll grow rich by selling yarn--
9851,BOOK IX.,"All these he'll give you out and out,"
9852,BOOK IX.,"And add the wench you fratch'd about,"
9853,BOOK IX.,"And swears you someway so bewitch her,"
9854,BOOK IX.,She never yet would let him switch her.
9855,BOOK IX.,"Besides all this, when we have taken"
9856,BOOK IX.,"The town, with all their eggs and bacon,"
9857,BOOK IX.,"Of belly-timber you'll have plenty,"
9858,BOOK IX.,"And a round dozen, if not twenty,"
9859,BOOK IX.,"Plump girls; and, if on leap and trial"
9860,BOOK IX.,(Which they must take without denial)
9861,BOOK IX.,"You like 'em not, you need not choose 'em,"
9862,BOOK IX.,"We'll snap 'em up, though you refuse 'em;"
9863,BOOK IX.,"Then try again, if that will ease you,"
9864,BOOK IX.,Till you can find a score to please you:
9865,BOOK IX.,"And, when this job of jobs is done,"
9866,BOOK IX.,"Which must, I think, be special fun,"
9867,BOOK IX.,He'll take you home and call you son:
9868,BOOK IX.,Of all his lands the farm that best is
9869,BOOK IX.,He'll split 'twixt you and bold Orestes.
9870,BOOK IX.,"Lastly, three daughters he can boast,"
9871,BOOK IX.,"All taught to bake, and boil, and roast;"
9872,BOOK IX.,"Useful i' th' parlour, hall, or kitchen,"
9873,BOOK IX.,And notable fine girls at stitching--
9874,BOOK IX.,"Your shirts I mean, the wrists or neck,"
9875,BOOK IX.,"Whether your linen's plain or check,"
9876,BOOK IX.,"Which, my good friend, will be to you"
9877,BOOK IX.,"Of use, and profitable too;"
9878,BOOK IX.,Because you need not then go swapping
9879,BOOK IX.,"Your smuggled tea for shirts in Wapping,"
9880,BOOK IX.,"Where ware that's sound cannot be gotten,"
9881,BOOK IX.,And all their stitching-tackle rotten.
9882,BOOK IX.,Laodice and Iphigene
9883,BOOK IX.,Are two of these fine girls I mean;
9884,BOOK IX.,In the sun's rays there not a beam is
9885,BOOK IX.,So bright as red-hair'd Chrysothemis;
9886,BOOK IX.,"All three are sprightly buxom jades,"
9887,BOOK IX.,"And, what's a rarity, they're maids!"
9888,BOOK IX.,"These in their Sunday's yard-wide stuff,"
9889,BOOK IX.,"Or, if you like 'em best, in buff,"
9890,BOOK IX.,"He'll let you see, to take your choice,"
9891,BOOK IX.,Take which you will you have his voice;
9892,BOOK IX.,"And, for her portion, you'll have more"
9893,BOOK IX.,Than ****** spent upon his whore:
9894,BOOK IX.,"Further, these mighty gifts to crown,"
9895,BOOK IX.,"He'll make you bailiff of a town,"
9896,BOOK IX.,"Where, on a grand election year;"
9897,BOOK IX.,"If you are careful, you may clear"
9898,BOOK IX.,"Ten pounds, as sure as you were born,"
9899,BOOK IX.,"Or twenty, for a false return:"
9900,BOOK IX.,"But let this caution be your guide,"
9901,BOOK IX.,"That you return the strongest side,"
9902,BOOK IX.,Else you may chance to find your pate
9903,BOOK IX.,O' th' wrong side of an iron grate.
9904,BOOK IX.,Likewise six villages do lie
9905,BOOK IX.,"Within this borough's liberty,"
9906,BOOK IX.,"Of which, if I may gain belief."
9907,BOOK IX.,You shall be constable in chief;
9908,BOOK IX.,Both Pherœ and Enope too
9909,BOOK IX.,"Must then pull off their caps to you,"
9910,BOOK IX.,"And you, when you think 't worth the while,"
9911,BOOK IX.,May kiss the girls of Cardamyle;
9912,BOOK IX.,"With Pedasus, whose stock of trees"
9913,BOOK IX.,Bear an estate in gooseberries.
9914,BOOK IX.,"These, join'd with Hira and Epea,"
9915,BOOK IX.,"And special fields about Anthea,"
9916,BOOK IX.,"All stretch along the salt-sea beach,"
9917,BOOK IX.,And very near to Pylos reach;
9918,BOOK IX.,"Where bulls, and cows, and oxen roar,"
9919,BOOK IX.,"And men and women drink and whore,"
9920,BOOK IX.,"And where they still continue whoring,"
9921,BOOK IX.,"In spite of squinting Whitfield's roaring,"
9922,BOOK IX.,Although he deals to ev'ry station
9923,BOOK IX.,"Such thumping doses of damnation,"
9924,BOOK IX.,You'd swear he had a patent got
9925,BOOK IX.,(As folks have done for pills and shot)
9926,BOOK IX.,"That none but Wesley, he, and Grimstone[2],"
9927,BOOK IX.,May deal in burning pitch and brimstone.
9928,BOOK IX.,See what he offers to appease you!
9929,BOOK IX.,"The devil's in't, if he don't please you:"
9930,BOOK IX.,"By prayers the hardest thing relaxes,"
9931,BOOK IX.,"Nothing stands fix'd, but death and taxes."
9932,BOOK IX.,"You'll see, Achilles, what he proffers,"
9933,BOOK IX.,And troth I thought 'em handsome offers;
9934,BOOK IX.,But if you turn a flat deaf ear
9935,BOOK IX.,"To our petition, folks will swear"
9936,BOOK IX.,"Your liver is grown white with whoring,"
9937,BOOK IX.,And now you're good for nought but roaring;
9938,BOOK IX.,From whence they fairly must conjecture
9939,BOOK IX.,"You dare not face that rascal Hector,"
9940,BOOK IX.,"Who, I am hopeful, kicks us now,"
9941,BOOK IX.,Only to be re-kick'd by you.
9942,BOOK IX.,
9943,BOOK IX.,Achilles answers: Surely this is
9944,BOOK IX.,"A rare long speech, my friend Ulysses!"
9945,BOOK IX.,And in return I'll give you for't
9946,BOOK IX.,"A speech that, be it long or short,"
9947,BOOK IX.,"Shall speak my mind--for may I sink,"
9948,BOOK IX.,If I'll say aught but what I think!
9949,BOOK IX.,"Though, if your friends expect to see"
9950,BOOK IX.,"A single grain of help from me,"
9951,BOOK IX.,"Tell 'em, as sure as there you sit,"
9952,BOOK IX.,They're most abominably bit.
9953,BOOK IX.,"Who one thing speaks and thinks another,"
9954,BOOK IX.,"Though he were born of my own mother,"
9955,BOOK IX.,"Should I not use him right, I ask all,"
9956,BOOK IX.,To d---n him for a scoundrel rascal?
9957,BOOK IX.,And therefore all the Greeks you'll find
9958,BOOK IX.,Will hardly make me change my mind.
9959,BOOK IX.,"On their account when Troy I spank'd,"
9960,BOOK IX.,"You see how finely I got thank'd,"
9961,BOOK IX.,Your scoundrel chief must get a-stride on
9962,BOOK IX.,"The only tit I had ride on,"
9963,BOOK IX.,But on a bible book I've swore
9964,BOOK IX.,Never to do so any more;
9965,BOOK IX.,"Ev'ry poor heartless rogue you'll stand by,"
9966,BOOK IX.,"Rather than Monckton, Hawke, and Granby;"
9967,BOOK IX.,"For, when a brave man tumbles down,"
9968,BOOK IX.,You'll help a scoundrel up as soon.
9969,BOOK IX.,Pray what the devil have I got
9970,BOOK IX.,For all the rogues I've sent to rot?
9971,BOOK IX.,"Just like that careful bird the tit,"
9972,BOOK IX.,"Who never tastes a single bit,"
9973,BOOK IX.,But still keeps picking worms and scraping
9974,BOOK IX.,Till ev'ry tit gives over gaping;
9975,BOOK IX.,Such pains for thankless Greece I've taken.
9976,BOOK IX.,And sav'd their measly pocky bacon;
9977,BOOK IX.,Kept all their loving spouses' plackets
9978,BOOK IX.,From being trimm'd by Trojan jackets;
9979,BOOK IX.,"Watch'd all the night in heavy buff,"
9980,BOOK IX.,And work'd all day at kick and cuff;
9981,BOOK IX.,"Twelve farmers' huts and barns I plunder'd,"
9982,BOOK IX.,"And should, if there had been a hundred:"
9983,BOOK IX.,"That thick-skull'd whelp, your gen'ral Blunder,"
9984,BOOK IX.,"Came in of course for all the plunder,"
9985,BOOK IX.,"Began to fill his paunch the first,"
9986,BOOK IX.,And guttled cheese-cakes till he burst:
9987,BOOK IX.,"Two dozen down his throat he switches,"
9988,BOOK IX.,Then ramm'd two dozen in his breeches.
9989,BOOK IX.,"Besides, he ev'ry kettle got,"
9990,BOOK IX.,Except one lousy porridge-pot.
9991,BOOK IX.,"And one fat wench so rarely fed,"
9992,BOOK IX.,Her cheeks as well as hair were red.
9993,BOOK IX.,"My men that fought, and won the stake,"
9994,BOOK IX.,"Like those that did th' Havannah take,"
9995,BOOK IX.,Receiv'd from this great chief of Greece
9996,BOOK IX.,'Bout twelve or fifteen pence apiece;
9997,BOOK IX.,"He likewise gave, with much ado,"
9998,BOOK IX.,"A little to the captains too,"
9999,BOOK IX.,"But not so much, by far, as will"
10000,BOOK IX.,Pay half their sneaking taylors' bill;
10001,BOOK IX.,"The rest, like A****, he sent"
10002,BOOK IX.,"To his own hoard; yet, not content,"
10003,BOOK IX.,His idle hours he could not pass
10004,BOOK IX.,Without my carrot-pated lass.
10005,BOOK IX.,Let him the buxom dame enjoy;
10006,BOOK IX.,But what's our quarrel then with Troy[3]?
10007,BOOK IX.,You all were sensible before
10008,BOOK IX.,We're only fighting for a whore:
10009,BOOK IX.,"Don't wonder then, if for a harlot"
10010,BOOK IX.,You see me drub that thieving varlet.
10011,BOOK IX.,"Must Atreus' sons all wenches seize,"
10012,BOOK IX.,"And trim 'em when and where they please,"
10013,BOOK IX.,"Whilst we, who all their prizes won,"
10014,BOOK IX.,Must thank 'em for a butter'd bun?
10015,BOOK IX.,"Mean sneaking scrubs may go on still,"
10016,BOOK IX.,But seal my day-lights if I will!
10017,BOOK IX.,A heart that's made of standard bullion
10018,BOOK IX.,Will love his wench although a scullion;
10019,BOOK IX.,"Nay, though he takes a rag-mop squeezer,"
10020,BOOK IX.,He ought to do his best to please her.
10021,BOOK IX.,"I lik'd the girl, and, on my life,"
10022,BOOK IX.,Us'd her as though she'd been my wife;
10023,BOOK IX.,"And, may I never drub the French,"
10024,BOOK IX.,"If I'd have parted with the wench,"
10025,BOOK IX.,"But Pallas came down stairs, you know,"
10026,BOOK IX.,And order'd me to let her go!
10027,BOOK IX.,"But, once deceiv'd, I'll tell you plain."
10028,BOOK IX.,I'll never trust a king again:
10029,BOOK IX.,"He's wrong'd me in the dearest part,"
10030,BOOK IX.,And from my soul L---d d---n his heart!
10031,BOOK IX.,This is my mind; to mend the job
10032,BOOK IX.,Let him consult your busy nob;
10033,BOOK IX.,"Where you can't lend a helping hand,"
10034,BOOK IX.,The devil would be at a stand.
10035,BOOK IX.,"But why the pox should he want me,"
10036,BOOK IX.,"When I such mighty works can see,"
10037,BOOK IX.,With wondrous ramparts and a trench?
10038,BOOK IX.,Surely his engineers were French!
10039,BOOK IX.,"The Greeks could never raise such works,"
10040,BOOK IX.,They'd baffle a whole host of Turks;
10041,BOOK IX.,"And yet he fears, as I conjecture,"
10042,BOOK IX.,They cannot keep out swagg'ring Hector:
10043,BOOK IX.,"When I along with Ajax steer'd,"
10044,BOOK IX.,Then no such bullying work appear'd;
10045,BOOK IX.,"These fighting Trojans kept their gates up,"
10046,BOOK IX.,And very seldom popp'd their pates up
10047,BOOK IX.,"Above their wall, but then were fain"
10048,BOOK IX.,To pop 'em quickly down again.
10049,BOOK IX.,The mighty Hector ventur'd once
10050,BOOK IX.,"Without the gates, but sav'd his sconce"
10051,BOOK IX.,"By running back into the town,"
10052,BOOK IX.,"Or, by my soul, I'd crack'd his crown!"
10053,BOOK IX.,"And had I still look'd sharp about,"
10054,BOOK IX.,He ne'er again had ventur'd out.
10055,BOOK IX.,"Now we no more shall think of fighting,"
10056,BOOK IX.,"But soon as th' morning brings some light in,"
10057,BOOK IX.,"If we can catch a leading gale,"
10058,BOOK IX.,"You'll spy my lighters under sail,"
10059,BOOK IX.,"And the third day, by three o'clock,"
10060,BOOK IX.,"Don't fear to reach to Puddle Dock,"
10061,BOOK IX.,Where there's no doubt but we shall find
10062,BOOK IX.,"The heaps of goods I left behind,"
10063,BOOK IX.,"Some rusty kettles, pots, and pans,"
10064,BOOK IX.,And half a dozen copper cans.
10065,BOOK IX.,"To these I'll add what I got here,"
10066,BOOK IX.,"Earn'd by my labour plaguy dear,"
10067,BOOK IX.,"With all my square-stern'd thumping jades,"
10068,BOOK IX.,By people here call'd country maids.
10069,BOOK IX.,"I lik'd but one above them all,"
10070,BOOK IX.,And that your scoundrel gen'ral stole:
10071,BOOK IX.,"Then tell him thus, and do not fear ye"
10072,BOOK IX.,"To speak that all the Greeks may hear ye,"
10073,BOOK IX.,Let them all hear I call their chief
10074,BOOK IX.,"A lousy, pilf'ring, blackguard thief!"
10075,BOOK IX.,"Had he but his deserts, I know"
10076,BOOK IX.,"He would have swung five years ago,"
10077,BOOK IX.,And yet I've hopes to see him still
10078,BOOK IX.,Ride in a cart--up Holborn-Hill;
10079,BOOK IX.,"For, by my soul, the rascal's knav'ry"
10080,BOOK IX.,Designs you wooden shoes and slav'ry.
10081,BOOK IX.,"Keep you but honest, and I'm sure"
10082,BOOK IX.,The scoundrel dog will keep you poor;
10083,BOOK IX.,Although the rascal dare as well
10084,BOOK IX.,"Fetch my lord B---th's black soul from hell,"
10085,BOOK IX.,As venture into any place
10086,BOOK IX.,Where I may see his ugly face--
10087,BOOK IX.,"For, if he does, by G-d, I'll fell him!"
10088,BOOK IX.,"And that, Ulysses, you may tell him;"
10089,BOOK IX.,"And add, I neither will collogue"
10090,BOOK IX.,Nor fight along with such a rogue.
10091,BOOK IX.,"Let the poor dog, since Jove deprives him"
10092,BOOK IX.,"Of sense, run where the devil drives him:"
10093,BOOK IX.,"A man may be bamboozled once,"
10094,BOOK IX.,"As I was, by a thick-skull'd dunce;"
10095,BOOK IX.,"But if again I let it pass,"
10096,BOOK IX.,"Though he's the rogue, yet I'm the ass;"
10097,BOOK IX.,"From sneaking rascals full of shifts,"
10098,BOOK IX.,Tell him Achilles scorns all gifts;
10099,BOOK IX.,"Nay, though he promis'd me the whole"
10100,BOOK IX.,"His rogu'ry has from others stole,"
10101,BOOK IX.,I'd rather stand to see him undone
10102,BOOK IX.,"Than have the running cash of London,"
10103,BOOK IX.,"Whose money, judg'd by what they spend,"
10104,BOOK IX.,Can surely never have an end;
10105,BOOK IX.,Yet could the sneaking scoundrel ask all
10106,BOOK IX.,"That running cash for me, the rascal"
10107,BOOK IX.,"Shall ne'er have my assistance, d--n me!"
10108,BOOK IX.,"Nor any chance again to flam me,"
10109,BOOK IX.,"Nor will I ever kiss his daughter,"
10110,BOOK IX.,Though H*** herself had taught her
10111,BOOK IX.,The very motions maids at court
10112,BOOK IX.,All know will make the finest sport--
10113,BOOK IX.,"Nay, was she all in di'monds dress'd,"
10114,BOOK IX.,"And had of things the very best,"
10115,BOOK IX.,"Yet, rather than with him agree,"
10116,BOOK IX.,The second-best shall serve for me;
10117,BOOK IX.,"Sooner than he my pate shall flam,"
10118,BOOK IX.,"I'll marry with the devil's dam,"
10119,BOOK IX.,For I'm resolv'd to sow no seed
10120,BOOK IX.,On such bad ground; I hate the breed!
10121,BOOK IX.,"When I go home, if God spare life,"
10122,BOOK IX.,I'll get my dad to choose a wife;
10123,BOOK IX.,"My back and parts, I'm pretty certain,"
10124,BOOK IX.,Will recommend me to a fortune;
10125,BOOK IX.,There's scarce a girl of Thessaly
10126,BOOK IX.,But will be glad to jump at me.
10127,BOOK IX.,"With one of these I'll join my hand,"
10128,BOOK IX.,"And stay at home and plow my land,"
10129,BOOK IX.,"On Sundays a good dinner cook,"
10130,BOOK IX.,Then sit and read a godly book--
10131,BOOK IX.,The book where Solomon the wise
10132,BOOK IX.,"A girl from ev'ry nation tries,"
10133,BOOK IX.,"And found, when all his strength was past."
10134,BOOK IX.,It was but vanity at last.
10135,BOOK IX.,"Here I can likewise mend my writing,"
10136,BOOK IX.,And leave to fools the trade of fighting.
10137,BOOK IX.,"Pray, of what use are all our cattle,"
10138,BOOK IX.,If once we're knock'd o' th' head in battle?
10139,BOOK IX.,"Not the best purl that e'er was drank,"
10140,BOOK IX.,"Nor all the money in the Bank,"
10141,BOOK IX.,"Not Child's great chest, with all that's in it,"
10142,BOOK IX.,Will save your life a single minute.
10143,BOOK IX.,"We may recover money lost,"
10144,BOOK IX.,"Or nags when stole, on paying cost;"
10145,BOOK IX.,"But if your breath you once let slip,"
10146,BOOK IX.,The devil gets you on the hip;
10147,BOOK IX.,And he was never known to let
10148,BOOK IX.,"A sinner once escape his net,"
10149,BOOK IX.,"Except a fiddler[4] of the town,"
10150,BOOK IX.,"That took a hurdigurdy down,"
10151,BOOK IX.,"And made such cursed noise below,"
10152,BOOK IX.,Satan was glad to let him go;
10153,BOOK IX.,"Which gave old Handel[5] room to crack,"
10154,BOOK IX.,The devil soon would send him back:
10155,BOOK IX.,"But as we've never seen him yet,"
10156,BOOK IX.,'Tis ten to one th' old fellow's bit.
10157,BOOK IX.,"Long since a gipsy told my fortune,"
10158,BOOK IX.,That I should be demolish'd certain:
10159,BOOK IX.,"If I stay here, my life 'twill curtail,"
10160,BOOK IX.,But then my fame will be immortal;
10161,BOOK IX.,"Ballads in print shall spread my fame,"
10162,BOOK IX.,And ballad-singers roar my name:
10163,BOOK IX.,"If I go home I change my fate,"
10164,BOOK IX.,"And spin out life a longer date,"
10165,BOOK IX.,Like country 'squires lie warm and snug.
10166,BOOK IX.,And snore a hundred years incog.
10167,BOOK IX.,"This course, my friends, will I pursue,"
10168,BOOK IX.,"And so, if you are wise, will you."
10169,BOOK IX.,"Seek your own homes without delay,"
10170,BOOK IX.,"Nor longer here for dry blows stay,"
10171,BOOK IX.,Where nothing can be got but raps
10172,BOOK IX.,"Upon your pates, or slaps o' th' chaps;"
10173,BOOK IX.,"For Jove, I'll speak it to his face,"
10174,BOOK IX.,"Defends this whoring Trojan race,"
10175,BOOK IX.,"Heartens them on our boats to plunder,"
10176,BOOK IX.,But scares our shabby rogues with thunder.
10177,BOOK IX.,"And now I've told you all my mind,"
10178,BOOK IX.,Pray let your loggerheads be join'd
10179,BOOK IX.,In consultation how to 'scape
10180,BOOK IX.,Your present most unlucky scrape.
10181,BOOK IX.,"This string has snapp'd, but you, I know,"
10182,BOOK IX.,"Have always two strings to your bow,"
10183,BOOK IX.,"And yet you'll find, I don't dispute,"
10184,BOOK IX.,Some auger-hole to wriggle out:
10185,BOOK IX.,This is the answer you may carry;
10186,BOOK IX.,So march! but let old Phœnix tarry;
10187,BOOK IX.,I think that he should have a tomb
10188,BOOK IX.,"To lay his grizzle beard at home,"
10189,BOOK IX.,Although the old curmudgeon may
10190,BOOK IX.,"Just as he pleases, go or stay."
10191,BOOK IX.,
10192,BOOK IX.,"This speech of speeches ending here,"
10193,BOOK IX.,Like three stuck pigs it made 'em stare;
10194,BOOK IX.,"When Phœnix rose, but first he cried,"
10195,BOOK IX.,"Then wip'd his nose, before he tried"
10196,BOOK IX.,A few persuasive words to speak;
10197,BOOK IX.,"But his old pipe was grown so weak,"
10198,BOOK IX.,"He did not seem to talk, but squeak:"
10199,BOOK IX.,
10200,BOOK IX.,"O great Achilles! wilt thou fly,"
10201,BOOK IX.,And leave the Greeks like rats to die?
10202,BOOK IX.,"If you in anger trudge away,"
10203,BOOK IX.,How shall your old schoolmaster stay?
10204,BOOK IX.,When thy good daddy Peleus sent
10205,BOOK IX.,"Thee first to join the regiment,"
10206,BOOK IX.,"And bid thee stay, upon condition"
10207,BOOK IX.,I bought the very first commission
10208,BOOK IX.,"(For, to our scandal be it told,"
10209,BOOK IX.,"Commissions are both bought and sold),"
10210,BOOK IX.,"He sent me with thee, that I might"
10211,BOOK IX.,"Teach thee to bully, whore, and fight--"
10212,BOOK IX.,"Three cardinal virtues, which a brave"
10213,BOOK IX.,And jolly captain ought to have;
10214,BOOK IX.,"Which, added to a little drinking,"
10215,BOOK IX.,Will always keep his nob from thinking;
10216,BOOK IX.,"For soldiers, if they thought aright,"
10217,BOOK IX.,Would sooner far be d--d than fight
10218,BOOK IX.,"For rogues, who, when they've lost a leg,"
10219,BOOK IX.,Will hardly give them leave to beg.
10220,BOOK IX.,But yet I always did pursue
10221,BOOK IX.,"Your father's plan in teaching you,"
10222,BOOK IX.,And flux me if I leave you now!
10223,BOOK IX.,Not if the gods would lend their mill
10224,BOOK IX.,"To grind me young, or Doctor Hill"
10225,BOOK IX.,Would promise to keep off old age
10226,BOOK IX.,With the grand tincture of red sage.
10227,BOOK IX.,"Then would you hear me, thrice a week,"
10228,BOOK IX.,Make chambermaids by dozens squeak.
10229,BOOK IX.,"My dad so old, he scarce could move,"
10230,BOOK IX.,"Yet, with a pox, must fall in love;"
10231,BOOK IX.,My mam begg'd hard that I'd outwit him:
10232,BOOK IX.,"I did, and got the girl--so bit him."
10233,BOOK IX.,"But the old Heathen swore and curs'd,"
10234,BOOK IX.,As if his very gall would burst;
10235,BOOK IX.,"So far his passion crack'd his brain,"
10236,BOOK IX.,He pray'd I ne'er might stand again;
10237,BOOK IX.,"And sure I am, as you are there,"
10238,BOOK IX.,The devil help'd his wicked prayer.
10239,BOOK IX.,"I was damn'd vex'd, a man may swear,"
10240,BOOK IX.,"To find myself so very queer,"
10241,BOOK IX.,"That though I did on jellies sup,"
10242,BOOK IX.,"I ne'er could make affairs look up,"
10243,BOOK IX.,"And thought, so prone are we to evil,"
10244,BOOK IX.,To send th' old rascal to the devil;
10245,BOOK IX.,"But some kind goblin stay'd that thought,"
10246,BOOK IX.,So all my anger came to nought.
10247,BOOK IX.,"Then I would fly, aye, that I would,"
10248,BOOK IX.,Let all my friends do what they could:
10249,BOOK IX.,Nine suns they watch'd me night and day
10250,BOOK IX.,On the tenth eve I ran away
10251,BOOK IX.,"With a blind tinker, whose good metal"
10252,BOOK IX.,"Had mended many a crazy kettle,"
10253,BOOK IX.,"But grown less able now to trudge it,"
10254,BOOK IX.,I undertook to lug the budget;
10255,BOOK IX.,"And thus with eighteen-pence a-piece,"
10256,BOOK IX.,We took our travels through all Greece.
10257,BOOK IX.,"Many a merry day we pass'd,"
10258,BOOK IX.,"And weather'd many a bitter blast,"
10259,BOOK IX.,"And many a merry night, when tipsy,"
10260,BOOK IX.,We pigg'd in straw with each a gipsy:
10261,BOOK IX.,"At last, without a single sous,"
10262,BOOK IX.,"We reach'd your daddy's old farm-house,"
10263,BOOK IX.,"Who did to stay with him persuade me,"
10264,BOOK IX.,And dry-nurse to his son he made me;
10265,BOOK IX.,"Gave me a sal'ry for my keeping,"
10266,BOOK IX.,And patch'd the calf-crib up to sleep in.
10267,BOOK IX.,"Finding I had a taste to rule,"
10268,BOOK IX.,"He made me master of a school,"
10269,BOOK IX.,"To teach, as I could do it well,"
10270,BOOK IX.,The farmers' chub-fac'd boys to spell.
10271,BOOK IX.,And 'faith your dad I amply paid
10272,BOOK IX.,By making you so fine a blade--
10273,BOOK IX.,"Though you cut such a puff, d'ye see,"
10274,BOOK IX.,You'd been a noodle but for me.
10275,BOOK IX.,That I my time could ne'er employ
10276,BOOK IX.,On a more hopeful loving boy
10277,BOOK IX.,"Is true, and nought but truth I'll say;"
10278,BOOK IX.,It made me chuckle ev'ry day
10279,BOOK IX.,"To hear the little varlet mutter,"
10280,BOOK IX.,Unless I cut his bread and butter;
10281,BOOK IX.,"Often upon my knee he'd doze,"
10282,BOOK IX.,"And puke his milk upon my clothes,"
10283,BOOK IX.,"Which I rubb'd off as soon as done,"
10284,BOOK IX.,As if the lad had been my son:
10285,BOOK IX.,"I thought, or may the dry pox rot me!"
10286,BOOK IX.,"The devil had at last forgot me,"
10287,BOOK IX.,"And, spite of my old father's curse,"
10288,BOOK IX.,"I was thy dad, and not thy nurse:"
10289,BOOK IX.,You'll hardly think the joy I had
10290,BOOK IX.,In rearing such a hopeful lad.
10291,BOOK IX.,"Come, don't be cross, but dry our tears,"
10292,BOOK IX.,A valiant heart no malice bears;
10293,BOOK IX.,"When man repents and turns from evils,"
10294,BOOK IX.,He moves all hearts except the devil's;
10295,BOOK IX.,"Therefore, if you don't take our part,"
10296,BOOK IX.,You've got the devil of a heart.
10297,BOOK IX.,The wicked Jews themselves once sent
10298,BOOK IX.,Such prayers as made their god repent--
10299,BOOK IX.,"Prayers made him do it, though he knew"
10300,BOOK IX.,"They were a cursed wicked crew,"
10301,BOOK IX.,"And would, before the week was spent,"
10302,BOOK IX.,Make him on t'other side repent:
10303,BOOK IX.,"Our prayers are slow because they're lame,"
10304,BOOK IX.,"For which the parsons are to blame,"
10305,BOOK IX.,Who might have taught us to repeat
10306,BOOK IX.,"Prayers with much better legs and feet,"
10307,BOOK IX.,Howe'er they make a shift to follow
10308,BOOK IX.,Injustice with a whoop and hollow.
10309,BOOK IX.,"Although this fiery headlong madam,"
10310,BOOK IX.,"Injustice, 'mongst the sons of Adam"
10311,BOOK IX.,"Makes cursed work, yet prayers can heal"
10312,BOOK IX.,The mischiefs that she makes them feel:
10313,BOOK IX.,"And he that won't their voices hear,"
10314,BOOK IX.,Jove often makes him pay full dear;
10315,BOOK IX.,For then at private man or king
10316,BOOK IX.,"He lets Injustice take her swing,"
10317,BOOK IX.,"And, that no mortal may resist her,"
10318,BOOK IX.,Lends her a lawyer to assist her.
10319,BOOK IX.,"Then cease, my boy, to curse and swear,"
10320,BOOK IX.,And hear our lamentable prayer:
10321,BOOK IX.,"Had not the gen'ral made submission,"
10322,BOOK IX.,"May I be sous'd to all perdition,"
10323,BOOK IX.,If I'd have spoke a single sentence.
10324,BOOK IX.,In hopes to bring thee to repentance!
10325,BOOK IX.,"For, had not Fortune, ever fickle,"
10326,BOOK IX.,"Now left him in a stinking pickle,"
10327,BOOK IX.,"Not twenty guineas, I assure you,"
10328,BOOK IX.,Should make me plead against your fury;
10329,BOOK IX.,"But since he offers you so fairly,"
10330,BOOK IX.,"And decks his presents out so rarely,"
10331,BOOK IX.,"And since these curious things, d'ye see,"
10332,BOOK IX.,"Are sent by no less man than me,"
10333,BOOK IX.,"I would not have you shun the offer,"
10334,BOOK IX.,You'll ne'er refuse a better proffer;
10335,BOOK IX.,"And, lest you fail to nick the joint,"
10336,BOOK IX.,I'll just relate a case in point:
10337,BOOK IX.,
10338,BOOK IX.,Upon a steep and rocky mountain
10339,BOOK IX.,"Stands Calydon, beside a fountain;"
10340,BOOK IX.,"Th' Æolians strove to take the rock,"
10341,BOOK IX.,And awarded many a bitter knock
10342,BOOK IX.,From the Curetians; thus they hourly
10343,BOOK IX.,Kept basting one another purely:
10344,BOOK IX.,'Twas Cynthia's doing all: but whether
10345,BOOK IX.,She set 'em by the ears together
10346,BOOK IX.,"For cheating her of some good suppers,"
10347,BOOK IX.,"Or bumping one another's cruppers,"
10348,BOOK IX.,"Like Sodom's sons, I can't, I vow,"
10349,BOOK IX.,Explain that matter clearly now;
10350,BOOK IX.,"But something set her so agig,"
10351,BOOK IX.,"She sent a monstrous great he-pig,"
10352,BOOK IX.,That swallow'd ev'ry thing he found
10353,BOOK IX.,"Either above or under ground,"
10354,BOOK IX.,"Tore their potatoes up by th' roots,"
10355,BOOK IX.,"And all their apple-trees to boots,"
10356,BOOK IX.,"And made no bones of sheep or geese,"
10357,BOOK IX.,"But swallow'd feathers, horns, and fleece--"
10358,BOOK IX.,"This pig, no matter where 'twas bred,"
10359,BOOK IX.,Dick Meleager knock'd o' th' head;
10360,BOOK IX.,"Then all the bumpkins round came in,"
10361,BOOK IX.,"And box'd like devils for the skin,"
10362,BOOK IX.,"Brought out their pokers, spits, and ladles,"
10363,BOOK IX.,To gain the skin to make 'em saddles.
10364,BOOK IX.,"The bold Curetes, who had fully"
10365,BOOK IX.,"Resolv'd to baste this kill-pig bully,"
10366,BOOK IX.,Got rarely 'nointed; then he swore
10367,BOOK IX.,"A bloody oath he'd fight no more,"
10368,BOOK IX.,But go and lead a quiet life
10369,BOOK IX.,With dame Alcyone his wife.
10370,BOOK IX.,"Idas, her father, though a civil"
10371,BOOK IX.,"And well-bred man, would box the devil;"
10372,BOOK IX.,"Marpasa was her mother's name,"
10373,BOOK IX.,A handsome jolly country dame.
10374,BOOK IX.,"Now that trim singing rogue Apollo,"
10375,BOOK IX.,"This Idas' handsome wife did follow,"
10376,BOOK IX.,"And one dark foggy night, when all"
10377,BOOK IX.,"The family were out of call,"
10378,BOOK IX.,Jumbled her up against a wall.
10379,BOOK IX.,"Finding no help was nigh her, she"
10380,BOOK IX.,For that time took it patiently:
10381,BOOK IX.,"But, because Idas did not choose"
10382,BOOK IX.,"To be a quiet Cheapside spouse,"
10383,BOOK IX.,And let him round his freehold range
10384,BOOK IX.,To do his bus'ness whilst at 'Change
10385,BOOK IX.,I mean the business of his wife--
10386,BOOK IX.,He plagu'd poor Idas all his life.
10387,BOOK IX.,"Very fine principles, you'll say,"
10388,BOOK IX.,Their godships had that time o' day;
10389,BOOK IX.,"For, bad as we are all, 'tis true,"
10390,BOOK IX.,They're thought vile rogues that do so now.
10391,BOOK IX.,"But Alethea, though his mother,"
10392,BOOK IX.,"Because he chanc'd to kill her brother,"
10393,BOOK IX.,"With cursing such a noise did keep,"
10394,BOOK IX.,He could not get a wink of sleep;
10395,BOOK IX.,"Legions of fiends her curses drew,"
10396,BOOK IX.,"She curs'd till all the ground look'd blue,"
10397,BOOK IX.,"And set up such a shrill-ton'd yell,"
10398,BOOK IX.,They plainly heard her voice in hell;
10399,BOOK IX.,Her curses gave him such a diz'ness
10400,BOOK IX.,"It made him quite neglect his bus'ness,"
10401,BOOK IX.,"And spend his mornings, noons, and nights,"
10402,BOOK IX.,"At Mother Welch's, or at White's."
10403,BOOK IX.,"Etolia, woefully oppress'd,"
10404,BOOK IX.,And to the last degree distress'd
10405,BOOK IX.,"By foes all round, entreats his aid,"
10406,BOOK IX.,And sent a swingeing long parade
10407,BOOK IX.,"Of aldermanic wigs and gowns,"
10408,BOOK IX.,Collected from the neighb'ring towns;
10409,BOOK IX.,"And, for a wonder, he that led"
10410,BOOK IX.,This sweeping train had got a head:
10411,BOOK IX.,"They begg'd he'd come, with piteous tones,"
10412,BOOK IX.,"And break their adversaries' bones,"
10413,BOOK IX.,"And would he prove a good peace-maker,"
10414,BOOK IX.,They'd freely give him fifty acre
10415,BOOK IX.,Of as brave land as ever bore
10416,BOOK IX.,"A pile of grass, or crow flew o'er:"
10417,BOOK IX.,But in these times they durst not mention
10418,BOOK IX.,So vile an epithet as pension.
10419,BOOK IX.,"His father came and made a bow,"
10420,BOOK IX.,And all his sisters curtsy'd too:
10421,BOOK IX.,The cursing dame before him stood;
10422,BOOK IX.,"But, as for her, he damn'd her blood,"
10423,BOOK IX.,As any man of spirit would:
10424,BOOK IX.,"His wife came last, and rubb'd her eye,"
10425,BOOK IX.,"Then tun'd her pipe, and join'd the cry;"
10426,BOOK IX.,"Told him, if he won't come away,"
10427,BOOK IX.,The devil soon must be to pay--
10428,BOOK IX.,"So fast, says she, the ruin spreads,"
10429,BOOK IX.,There soon must be a smash of heads;
10430,BOOK IX.,"For when the men's hard heads are smack'd,"
10431,BOOK IX.,"The maiden-heads will soon be crack'd,"
10432,BOOK IX.,And all the virgins in the town
10433,BOOK IX.,Expect they shall be ravish'd soon:
10434,BOOK IX.,"If therefore you'll this time preserve 'em,"
10435,BOOK IX.,"At any time they'll let you serve 'em,"
10436,BOOK IX.,"And promise that they will not squeak,"
10437,BOOK IX.,Though you should ravish ten a-week:
10438,BOOK IX.,"But they would have you take great care,"
10439,BOOK IX.,You do not touch a single hair
10440,BOOK IX.,"Of Polly W-dc-k, lest some quack,"
10441,BOOK IX.,"With brazen face and conscience black,"
10442,BOOK IX.,"Should swear that he can tell by th' mark,"
10443,BOOK IX.,"Whether you kiss'd her in the dark,"
10444,BOOK IX.,"Or by broad day-light, and if she"
10445,BOOK IX.,"Kick'd hard, or took it patiently."
10446,BOOK IX.,
10447,BOOK IX.,"At this he grasp'd his stick, and soon"
10448,BOOK IX.,"Broke all their bones, and sav'd the town."
10449,BOOK IX.,"But 'cause his coming was so tardy,"
10450,BOOK IX.,These same Etolians grew fool-hardy;
10451,BOOK IX.,"And though he say'd both priest and church,"
10452,BOOK IX.,They left their saviour in the lurch;
10453,BOOK IX.,"Just as the bishops left their maker,"
10454,BOOK IX.,"And shunn'd the passage through Long Acre,"
10455,BOOK IX.,"'Tis dang'rous, cries each wary chap,"
10456,BOOK IX.,"To venture through the Devil's Gap[6],"
10457,BOOK IX.,The houses on both sides are all
10458,BOOK IX.,"So old, that, like the Duke, they'll fall,"
10459,BOOK IX.,"And crush, perhaps, each reverend sot"
10460,BOOK IX.,That runs where nothing's to be got;
10461,BOOK IX.,"And Satan, always on the watch"
10462,BOOK IX.,"The sons of any church to catch,"
10463,BOOK IX.,Dines rarely when his cook can dish up
10464,BOOK IX.,A rev'rend brawny well-fed bishop.
10465,BOOK IX.,
10466,BOOK IX.,But to return: From this great strait
10467,BOOK IX.,Pray help us ere it be too late;
10468,BOOK IX.,Your arm will stand us in no stead
10469,BOOK IX.,After we all are knock'd o' th' head;
10470,BOOK IX.,"Assist us, therefore, ere we faint,"
10471,BOOK IX.,And you shall be a popish saint.
10472,BOOK IX.,I ask'd the Pope if he knew where
10473,BOOK IX.,To find a day from saintship clear?
10474,BOOK IX.,"He answer'd No, but he would make"
10475,BOOK IX.,Some shift or other for your sake;
10476,BOOK IX.,Not doubting but amongst the crew
10477,BOOK IX.,To find a bigger rogue than you--
10478,BOOK IX.,"If so, says he, 'twill be no sin"
10479,BOOK IX.,"To kick him out, and put you in."
10480,BOOK IX.,
10481,BOOK IX.,Achilles then returns this answer:
10482,BOOK IX.,"My ever-honour'd nurse and grandsire,"
10483,BOOK IX.,"You know I'm us'd to make a shift,"
10484,BOOK IX.,And therefore want no bribe or gift:
10485,BOOK IX.,"If Jove and I are cater-cozens,"
10486,BOOK IX.,The Greeks may hang themselves by dozens!
10487,BOOK IX.,"If he thinks fit, I here will lag"
10488,BOOK IX.,"As long as I a toe can wag,"
10489,BOOK IX.,"Or go wherever he shall lug me,"
10490,BOOK IX.,But your old pate shall ne'er humbug me;
10491,BOOK IX.,Therefore no more attempt to bubble
10492,BOOK IX.,"Your loving friend, and give him trouble,"
10493,BOOK IX.,"For such a rogue as that Atrides,"
10494,BOOK IX.,"A scoundrel dog, whose greatest pride is"
10495,BOOK IX.,"To cheat and pilfer all he can,"
10496,BOOK IX.,And plunder every honest man!
10497,BOOK IX.,"I little thought, old friend, not I,"
10498,BOOK IX.,You could for such a rascal cry;
10499,BOOK IX.,"Whether small beer or ale we drink,"
10500,BOOK IX.,My friend like me should always think;
10501,BOOK IX.,In this 'tis honest to collogue
10502,BOOK IX.,To hate a dirty sneaking rogue;
10503,BOOK IX.,The very fellow that would do
10504,BOOK IX.,"Mischief to me, would hamstring you,"
10505,BOOK IX.,"Because, when Peleus dies, he knows"
10506,BOOK IX.,Half of my farm and cattle goes
10507,BOOK IX.,"To you by promise.--So, Ulysses,"
10508,BOOK IX.,Go tell your spitfire gen'ral this is
10509,BOOK IX.,"My firm resolve, at break of day"
10510,BOOK IX.,Either to stay or go away.--
10511,BOOK IX.,
10512,BOOK IX.,"Then orders, as these words he said,"
10513,BOOK IX.,A pan of coals for Phœnix' bed.
10514,BOOK IX.,"Now, you must know, this fine oration"
10515,BOOK IX.,Put Ajax in a bitter passion;
10516,BOOK IX.,"Blast my old boots, says he, but this is"
10517,BOOK IX.,"A mighty pretty job, Ulysses!"
10518,BOOK IX.,"We're sent by our wise-looking owls,"
10519,BOOK IX.,Only to make us April fools:
10520,BOOK IX.,See what we've got for all our pain!
10521,BOOK IX.,Rot me if e'er I'll cringe again!
10522,BOOK IX.,"No speech that we can make will stir him,"
10523,BOOK IX.,Were we to stay till doomsday for him:
10524,BOOK IX.,"Therefore 'tis proper we should go,"
10525,BOOK IX.,"Whether they like his words or no,"
10526,BOOK IX.,And tell our friends the fine pallabber
10527,BOOK IX.,That we just now have heard him jabber--
10528,BOOK IX.,"I'm sure that they, this foggy morn,"
10529,BOOK IX.,Are gaping hard for our return;
10530,BOOK IX.,You see he is on mischief bent--
10531,BOOK IX.,Such harden'd sinners ne'er repent:
10532,BOOK IX.,His cronies and old secret-keepers
10533,BOOK IX.,He minds no more than chimney-sweepers;
10534,BOOK IX.,"Yet, smite my eyes! if any other"
10535,BOOK IX.,"Should in a squabble lose a brother,"
10536,BOOK IX.,All the amends that's in folks' power
10537,BOOK IX.,"Is made, and people, ask no more!"
10538,BOOK IX.,"If an own father lose his son,"
10539,BOOK IX.,"As very oft, God knows, is done,"
10540,BOOK IX.,Should the damn'd rogue who did the deed
10541,BOOK IX.,Chance to be rich enough to bleed
10542,BOOK IX.,"A good round sum, and comes to shake it,"
10543,BOOK IX.,The people make the father take it.
10544,BOOK IX.,"The hardest hearts but thine relent,"
10545,BOOK IX.,And money makes a judge repent;
10546,BOOK IX.,But Jove has given thee a heart
10547,BOOK IX.,Made of a plank of Pharaoh's cart:
10548,BOOK IX.,"One wench was stole, but what of that?"
10549,BOOK IX.,"He offers seven full as fat,"
10550,BOOK IX.,"And fatter too, for all these wenches"
10551,BOOK IX.,"Have broader buttocks by some inches,"
10552,BOOK IX.,"With flesh so firm, without a hum,"
10553,BOOK IX.,I'd undertake upon the bum
10554,BOOK IX.,Of any of those girls (d'ye see?)
10555,BOOK IX.,"To beat a march, or crack a flea."
10556,BOOK IX.,"Come then, and be of better temper,"
10557,BOOK IX.,"And don't be cross and sulky semper,"
10558,BOOK IX.,Else we shall say you give a bit
10559,BOOK IX.,"Of roast, and baste us with the spit;"
10560,BOOK IX.,"Which sure must vex us to the heart,"
10561,BOOK IX.,Because we always take your part--
10562,BOOK IX.,"So much, that when poor scoundrels rail"
10563,BOOK IX.,"At your cross phiz, we seldom fail"
10564,BOOK IX.,"Either to knock the rascals down,"
10565,BOOK IX.,Or with a broomstick crack their crown--
10566,BOOK IX.,A rare short method I found out
10567,BOOK IX.,To finish any long dispute.
10568,BOOK IX.,
10569,BOOK IX.,"Achilles thus: My bully rock,"
10570,BOOK IX.,"Of all the Greeks the boldest cock,"
10571,BOOK IX.,In a bad cause you beat by far
10572,BOOK IX.,Pitt's speeches for a German war:
10573,BOOK IX.,"But it won't do, a man's that's wise"
10574,BOOK IX.,Will never be humbugg'd by lies.
10575,BOOK IX.,Such lies as from his tongue were sent
10576,BOOK IX.,To hum the British P---------.
10577,BOOK IX.,"Besides, there's nought can vex me worse"
10578,BOOK IX.,Than to refuse my good old nurse:
10579,BOOK IX.,"But when that fellow's name I hear,"
10580,BOOK IX.,"Spite of my guts my tongue will swear,"
10581,BOOK IX.,"So much the rascal does provoke me,"
10582,BOOK IX.,"My passion rises fit to choak me,"
10583,BOOK IX.,"And would, but that we Grecians are"
10584,BOOK IX.,"Such sons of freedom that we dare,"
10585,BOOK IX.,"Like English mob, do any thing,"
10586,BOOK IX.,"Blaspheme our God, or d--n our king."
10587,BOOK IX.,The usage I have had much worse is
10588,BOOK IX.,Than Oxford scholars use hack-horses:
10589,BOOK IX.,"Cheated, because he chose to rob me,"
10590,BOOK IX.,"And now sends you, my friends, to bob me."
10591,BOOK IX.,But flux my hide if you shall do it!
10592,BOOK IX.,I knew the dog would live to rue it!
10593,BOOK IX.,"Then tell the whelp, and tell him plain,"
10594,BOOK IX.,I'll never lift my hand again
10595,BOOK IX.,Till Hector and his roaring crew
10596,BOOK IX.,Have thump'd your sides all black and blue;
10597,BOOK IX.,"When all your boats in flames are crackling,"
10598,BOOK IX.,I'll stir to save my own old tackling;
10599,BOOK IX.,"And whilst with joy the Trojan chuckles,"
10600,BOOK IX.,Just then I'll make him feel my knuckles.
10601,BOOK IX.,
10602,BOOK IX.,"At this he put the mug about,"
10603,BOOK IX.,And begg'd they'd see the liquor out.
10604,BOOK IX.,To keep their souls from growing dull
10605,BOOK IX.,Each took a pretty hearty pull;
10606,BOOK IX.,Then swash'd the leavings of that round
10607,BOOK IX.,For a libation on the ground--
10608,BOOK IX.,A method I have heard folks say
10609,BOOK IX.,Our chairmen use to this good day.
10610,BOOK IX.,"This done, they made a bow, and went"
10611,BOOK IX.,Full speed to find the gen'ral's tent.
10612,BOOK IX.,
10613,BOOK IX.,"In the mean time a strapping jade,"
10614,BOOK IX.,"Achilles call'd his chamber-maid,"
10615,BOOK IX.,Spread on the ground for this old sinner
10616,BOOK IX.,"Some sheep-skins borrow'd from a skinner,"
10617,BOOK IX.,Of blankets then she brought a pair
10618,BOOK IX.,"Full of great holes, and quite thread-bare,"
10619,BOOK IX.,"But yet they were, though bitter bad,"
10620,BOOK IX.,The very best Achilles had;
10621,BOOK IX.,"Howe'er, to keep th' old Grecian snug,"
10622,BOOK IX.,"From her own bed she spar'd a rug,"
10623,BOOK IX.,"With bugs, and grease, and sweat so full,"
10624,BOOK IX.,It kept th' old soul as warm as wool;
10625,BOOK IX.,"For he, in less than half an hour,"
10626,BOOK IX.,"Began to crack, and snort, and snore,"
10627,BOOK IX.,"So loud, I'll take my oath the sound"
10628,BOOK IX.,Was heard at least a furlong round.
10629,BOOK IX.,
10630,BOOK IX.,"Achilles, maugre all his roaring,"
10631,BOOK IX.,"Kept the best room himself to snore in,"
10632,BOOK IX.,Where stripping off his clothes with speed he
10633,BOOK IX.,"Whipp'd into bed to Diomede,"
10634,BOOK IX.,"A Yorkshire girl, whose awkward motion"
10635,BOOK IX.,"So pleas'd the whelp, that I've a notion"
10636,BOOK IX.,He better lik'd to sleep with her
10637,BOOK IX.,Than the fat jade they squabbled for.
10638,BOOK IX.,"Patroclus' bed was warm'd the last,"
10639,BOOK IX.,And he his nights in pleasure pass'd
10640,BOOK IX.,"By a fair maiden's side call'd Iphis,"
10641,BOOK IX.,Where no such jars as with a wife is:
10642,BOOK IX.,"This girl was well content to share it,"
10643,BOOK IX.,And took it just as he could spare it;
10644,BOOK IX.,For early in the morn she never
10645,BOOK IX.,"Cry'd, Lord! my dear, you'll sleep for ever!"
10646,BOOK IX.,
10647,BOOK IX.,Now Ajax and Ulysses put
10648,BOOK IX.,"The best leg forward to the hut,"
10649,BOOK IX.,Where the old soakers still kept drinking
10650,BOOK IX.,To drown all cares care--comes by thinking:
10651,BOOK IX.,"Each man with glass in hand they found,"
10652,BOOK IX.,Standing to drink one bumper round;
10653,BOOK IX.,"One bumper more to crown the rest,"
10654,BOOK IX.,In English call'd the very best;
10655,BOOK IX.,"But, though the meaning is the same,"
10656,BOOK IX.,In Greek it bears another name;
10657,BOOK IX.,"I think my master, Doctor Busby,"
10658,BOOK IX.,Us'd to pronounce it polioflusby.
10659,BOOK IX.,"Great Agamemnon spy'd 'em coming,"
10660,BOOK IX.,"And bid 'em speak, and not stand humming,"
10661,BOOK IX.,"On this sly Ithacus replies,"
10662,BOOK IX.,"Smite all my limbs, and blast my eyes,"
10663,BOOK IX.,If such a fellow e'er was seen
10664,BOOK IX.,As your queer fellow where we've been!
10665,BOOK IX.,"The more we pray, the more he swears,"
10666,BOOK IX.,And grins to see us hang our ears.
10667,BOOK IX.,Because you said we should not want
10668,BOOK IX.,"His aid, he vow'd he would not grant"
10669,BOOK IX.,To such a noisy brangling whelp
10670,BOOK IX.,"As you, a single grain of help;"
10671,BOOK IX.,"And swore, unless it was your brother,"
10672,BOOK IX.,On earth there was not such another
10673,BOOK IX.,D---d blackguard scoundrel left alive--
10674,BOOK IX.,The rest were hang'd in forty-five:
10675,BOOK IX.,"But what need he for help to call,"
10676,BOOK IX.,Whose clapper can outscold them all?
10677,BOOK IX.,"For when his tongue has once begun,"
10678,BOOK IX.,He'll make a Thames-street fish-wife run.
10679,BOOK IX.,King Solomon himself doth say
10680,BOOK IX.,A scolding woman any day
10681,BOOK IX.,Can drive an enemy away:
10682,BOOK IX.,Now he that can in any weather
10683,BOOK IX.,"Outscold a dozen brims together,"
10684,BOOK IX.,"Can surely make that Trojan whelp,"
10685,BOOK IX.,"That Hector, run without my help;"
10686,BOOK IX.,"Therefore i' th' morn when up you get,"
10687,BOOK IX.,"Depend you'll see my mainsail set,"
10688,BOOK IX.,"And if you've any prudence, you"
10689,BOOK IX.,Will hoist your lighters mainsail too;
10690,BOOK IX.,"For Jove, I speak it to his face,"
10691,BOOK IX.,Defends this whoring Trojan race:
10692,BOOK IX.,"He'll save these rascals from a scouring,"
10693,BOOK IX.,"Because they, like himself, love whoring."
10694,BOOK IX.,
10695,BOOK IX.,"These were his words, what more appear'd"
10696,BOOK IX.,Both Ajax and the beadles heard;
10697,BOOK IX.,"But Phœnix in his tent he keeps,"
10698,BOOK IX.,"Where for this night th' old fellow sleeps,"
10699,BOOK IX.,"Though in the morn, he told us so,"
10700,BOOK IX.,He'll give him leave to stay or go:
10701,BOOK IX.,"Then added, Though you should escape"
10702,BOOK IX.,"Without his help from this d----d scrape,"
10703,BOOK IX.,"And save your hide from being bang'd,"
10704,BOOK IX.,He hopes to live to see you hang'd.
10705,BOOK IX.,
10706,BOOK IX.,Ulysses ceas'd: the congregation
10707,BOOK IX.,Seem'd in a dreadful consternation;
10708,BOOK IX.,"Their eyes show'd nothing but the whites,"
10709,BOOK IX.,Like Wesley and his Culamites;
10710,BOOK IX.,"A look of horror spread all o'er 'em,"
10711,BOOK IX.,"As if they saw hell-fire before 'em,"
10712,BOOK IX.,And Satan with a sable pack
10713,BOOK IX.,Of long-tail'd devils at their back.
10714,BOOK IX.,Ready with pitchforks to begin
10715,BOOK IX.,To push them all by dozens in;When
10716,BOOK IX.,"up the bold Tydides sprung,"
10717,BOOK IX.,And in a twinkling found his tongue
10718,BOOK IX.,"(No stamm'ring orator would do,"
10719,BOOK IX.,A nimble tongue was wanting now):
10720,BOOK IX.,"So wild the Greeks began to stare,"
10721,BOOK IX.,He saw there was no time to spare;
10722,BOOK IX.,"So sprang up nimbly from his seat,"
10723,BOOK IX.,And found at once his tongue and feet:
10724,BOOK IX.,
10725,BOOK IX.,"Why should we sneak, and beg, and pray,"
10726,BOOK IX.,As if we had no other way?
10727,BOOK IX.,"This man with pride will crack his guts,"
10728,BOOK IX.,To him our prayers are eggs and nuts;
10729,BOOK IX.,"And to proud puppies, I am clear,"
10730,BOOK IX.,"The more you pray, the more they swear."
10731,BOOK IX.,"Have you not done, Sir, all you can do"
10732,BOOK IX.,And pray what more can Ferdinando?
10733,BOOK IX.,"Let him, since so much wrath attends him,"
10734,BOOK IX.,Sit sulky till the devil mends him;
10735,BOOK IX.,"Let him, since it belikes him well,"
10736,BOOK IX.,"Stay where he is, or go to hell!"
10737,BOOK IX.,We have it in our power to show
10738,BOOK IX.,Well do as much as men can do:
10739,BOOK IX.,"Therefore, to put us in good plight"
10740,BOOK IX.,"For boxing, let us drink all night,"
10741,BOOK IX.,"Boose it about to drown all sorrow,"
10742,BOOK IX.,Boxing will make us cool to-morrow.
10743,BOOK IX.,"Soon as the sun the welkin graces,"
10744,BOOK IX.,"He'll find a sun in all our faces,"
10745,BOOK IX.,"Painted so red with humming ale,"
10746,BOOK IX.,We'll make his fiery face look pale;
10747,BOOK IX.,The god will stand amaz'd to think
10748,BOOK IX.,Such virtue lies in mortal drink;
10749,BOOK IX.,"Nor shall he catch us without coats,"
10750,BOOK IX.,But looking sharp before the boats:
10751,BOOK IX.,"And you, Atrides, in the front"
10752,BOOK IX.,For once must stand and bear the brunt;
10753,BOOK IX.,"For once, I say, we hope you'll do't,"
10754,BOOK IX.,It is not oft we put you to't.
10755,BOOK IX.,
10756,BOOK IX.,"This speech produc'd a mighty shout,"
10757,BOOK IX.,Whilst Diom. push'd the mug about:
10758,BOOK IX.,"They drank; then, rolling on the floor,"
10759,BOOK IX.,Began like aldermen to snore.

10824,BOOK X.,"The Greeks, though sorely drubb'd all day,"
10825,BOOK X.,Asleep before their scullers lay--
10826,BOOK X.,"All but poor Agamemnon, who"
10827,BOOK X.,Could only nod a spell or so.
10828,BOOK X.,Distracted with a thousand fears
10829,BOOK X.,"How to get off and save his ears,"
10830,BOOK X.,His fears did such a rumbling keep
10831,BOOK X.,"Within his guts, he could not sleep."
10832,BOOK X.,"As when a barrel of small-beer,"
10833,BOOK X.,"No matter whether foul or clear,"
10834,BOOK X.,"Begins to leak, drop follows drop"
10835,BOOK X.,As fast as wanton schoolboys hop:
10836,BOOK X.,So quick this valiant Greek kept sighing.
10837,BOOK X.,At last he fairly fell a-crying;
10838,BOOK X.,"Then, with a face of rueful length,"
10839,BOOK X.,Peep'd up to spy the Trojans' strength;
10840,BOOK X.,"When, to his wondrous great amaze,"
10841,BOOK X.,"He saw a thousand bonfires blaze,"
10842,BOOK X.,"And heard so plain the Trojans f--t,"
10843,BOOK X.,It vex'd him to the guts and heart
10844,BOOK X.,"To think the rogues were got so near,"
10845,BOOK X.,That he their very ----s could hear;
10846,BOOK X.,Which sound he hated full as much
10847,BOOK X.,As Britons do the belching Dutch.
10848,BOOK X.,Whilst he was grunting in dispute
10849,BOOK X.,"To hang himself or fight it out,"
10850,BOOK X.,"He almost lugg'd, at one smart pull"
10851,BOOK X.,A pound of carrots from his skull;
10852,BOOK X.,"But finding that did little good,"
10853,BOOK X.,He fell to praying as he stood.
10854,BOOK X.,"Just as his second prayer begun,"
10855,BOOK X.,"Thinks he, By G-d, we're all undone,"
10856,BOOK X.,If Nestor can't the Trojans nick
10857,BOOK X.,By some old square-toe'd slipp'ry trick!
10858,BOOK X.,On which he wrapp'd his calf's-hide in
10859,BOOK X.,"A jacket made of lion's skin,"
10860,BOOK X.,"And then put on a pair of shoes,"
10861,BOOK X.,"Such as St. Giles's statesmen use,"
10862,BOOK X.,"With scarce a sole to keep out weather,"
10863,BOOK X.,And forty holes i' th' upper leather.
10864,BOOK X.,
10865,BOOK X.,His brother likewise found his tripes
10866,BOOK X.,"Most sorely twisted with the gripes,"
10867,BOOK X.,Because the very Greeks that came
10868,BOOK X.,To fetch away his light-heel'd dame
10869,BOOK X.,Were drawn into so bad a lay
10870,BOOK X.,They could not fetch themselves away
10871,BOOK X.,"To think they'd got in such a trap,"
10872,BOOK X.,Disturb'd the honest Spartan's nap:
10873,BOOK X.,"So out of bed in haste he got,"
10874,BOOK X.,"And quickly found the chamber-pot,"
10875,BOOK X.,"And whilst he made a little water,"
10876,BOOK X.,Took time to think about the matter;
10877,BOOK X.,"For his schoolmaster, Peter Ashley,"
10878,BOOK X.,Had taught him to do nothing rashly.
10879,BOOK X.,"When this important job was done,"
10880,BOOK X.,He put his greasy breeches on;
10881,BOOK X.,"Next button'd, underneath his chin,"
10882,BOOK X.,A very fierce-look'd leopard-skin;
10883,BOOK X.,"Then took a broomstick in his hand,"
10884,BOOK X.,And trudg'd away along the strand
10885,BOOK X.,To call his elder brother up;
10886,BOOK X.,"When, lo! he found the squabbling tup"
10887,BOOK X.,Rear'd up against his lighter's side
10888,BOOK X.,"Twisting a string, with which he tied"
10889,BOOK X.,A rusty hanger to his side.
10890,BOOK X.,
10891,BOOK X.,To him the Spartan thus began:
10892,BOOK X.,What makes you put your dudgeon on?
10893,BOOK X.,D' you think of sending out some spy
10894,BOOK X.,"This dark and dismal night, to try"
10895,BOOK X.,"Whether the Trojans watch are keeping,"
10896,BOOK X.,Or pay great idle whelps for sleeping?
10897,BOOK X.,But who the pox d'ye think will mote
10898,BOOK X.,"This dismal night? Not I, by Jove!"
10899,BOOK X.,"The hardiest rogue in Fielding's gang,"
10900,BOOK X.,At such a task an a--e would hang.
10901,BOOK X.,
10902,BOOK X.,"The king replies: O Menelaus,"
10903,BOOK X.,I fear these Trojan rogues will pay us
10904,BOOK X.,"Both scot and lot for all our tricks,"
10905,BOOK X.,And baste us with their crabtree sticks.
10906,BOOK X.,"When cases, like our case, are bad,"
10907,BOOK X.,The best of counsel must be had:
10908,BOOK X.,"Therefore, besides both ---- and M--n,"
10909,BOOK X.,Above all things secure us N----n:
10910,BOOK X.,"Unless he's for us, d--n my blood"
10911,BOOK X.,If Beelzebub can do us good:
10912,BOOK X.,"For if on t'other side you place him,"
10913,BOOK X.,You know the devil cannot face him:
10914,BOOK X.,"And Jove, you see, denies us help,"
10915,BOOK X.,But lends it to that Trojan whelp.
10916,BOOK X.,Would ever man believe that one
10917,BOOK X.,Could smoke us all as he has done?
10918,BOOK X.,"But yesterday that blust'ring scrub,"
10919,BOOK X.,What heaps of serjeants did he drub!
10920,BOOK X.,"The Sun, before his link went out,"
10921,BOOK X.,Saw how he kick'd us all about;
10922,BOOK X.,"And yet, like yours and mine, the bitch"
10923,BOOK X.,His dam was never thought a witch;
10924,BOOK X.,"Nor is his dad, that queer old cur,"
10925,BOOK X.,"A wizard, or a conjurer:"
10926,BOOK X.,"Yet unborn Greeks, before they're gotten,"
10927,BOOK X.,"Shall wish the rascal dead and rotten,"
10928,BOOK X.,Because his laming all our nation
10929,BOOK X.,Will make a limping generation.
10930,BOOK X.,"Don't stand a moment to consider,"
10931,BOOK X.,But send me bully Ajax hither;
10932,BOOK X.,"Next hasten to Idomeneus,"
10933,BOOK X.,And hurry him away to see us:
10934,BOOK X.,To Nestor I will go before ye;
10935,BOOK X.,"He's telling some long trimtram story,"
10936,BOOK X.,Such as at any time he'll make
10937,BOOK X.,To keep the drunken watchmen wake;
10938,BOOK X.,"For that's his task to-night, and there"
10939,BOOK X.,I'm sure th' old cock will show his care;
10940,BOOK X.,But more especially that entry
10941,BOOK X.,Where Merion and his son stand sentry.
10942,BOOK X.,
10943,BOOK X.,Thus spoke the king; and Menelau
10944,BOOK X.,"Replies: Pray, brother, when I go,"
10945,BOOK X.,"And all your orders safely carry,"
10946,BOOK X.,"Must I return, or must I tarry?"
10947,BOOK X.,
10948,BOOK X.,"Tarry, be sure, replies the brother,"
10949,BOOK X.,We else shall miss of one another;
10950,BOOK X.,"The night is rather thick than clear,"
10951,BOOK X.,And candles are excessive dear;
10952,BOOK X.,The very last half-pound we bought
10953,BOOK X.,"You fetch'd yourself, and paid a groat."
10954,BOOK X.,"Resides, our lantherns were, you know,"
10955,BOOK X.,All broke to shatters long ago;
10956,BOOK X.,"But we must shift without 'em. Now,"
10957,BOOK X.,What I would recommend to you
10958,BOOK X.,"Is, all our ragged rogues to cheer,"
10959,BOOK X.,Tell 'em what whelps their fathers were:
10960,BOOK X.,"For us, since things so bad are got,"
10961,BOOK X.,"We e'en must work, or go to pot;"
10962,BOOK X.,"Jove has decreed that man must labour,"
10963,BOOK X.,And kings by chance must help their neighbour:
10964,BOOK X.,"In former days 'twas often done,"
10965,BOOK X.,But now as often let alone:
10966,BOOK X.,"Necessity has driv'n me to't,"
10967,BOOK X.,Or I'd as soon be hang'd as do't.
10968,BOOK X.,
10969,BOOK X.,Away then Agamemnon goes:
10970,BOOK X.,But first he clapp'd within his jaws
10971,BOOK X.,"A plug of Hobson's best tobacco,"
10972,BOOK X.,Then found old Nestor in a cracko;
10973,BOOK X.,"Stretch'd in his hammock snug he found him,"
10974,BOOK X.,"With clubs, oak-sticks, and broomstaves round him;"
10975,BOOK X.,"Like an old coachman, who, unable"
10976,BOOK X.,"To drive, yet loves the smell o' th' stable,"
10977,BOOK X.,"Th' old firelock on his guard did keep,"
10978,BOOK X.,"A sprite, called Fear, prevented sleep;"
10979,BOOK X.,He lean'd his head upon his hand.
10980,BOOK X.,"And call'd aloud, Plague on you, stand!"
10981,BOOK X.,"Say, who the pox are you that keep"
10982,BOOK X.,Strolling about whilst folks should sleep?
10983,BOOK X.,"Perhaps you're some poor hungry thief,"
10984,BOOK X.,Whose nose has smelt my leg of beef:
10985,BOOK X.,"If so, you've nos'd it mighty soon,"
10986,BOOK X.,'Twas only bak'd this afternoon.
10987,BOOK X.,"Or do you hunt some other prey,"
10988,BOOK X.,Or seek some sentry run away?
10989,BOOK X.,"Be who you will, it will undo ye"
10990,BOOK X.,If I should make the moon shine through ye.
10991,BOOK X.,
10992,BOOK X.,Then Agamemnon thus replies:
10993,BOOK X.,I'll tell thee all without disguise;
10994,BOOK X.,"And thou, in whom our nation glories"
10995,BOOK X.,"For telling Canterbury stories,"
10996,BOOK X.,Shalt hear a tale as lamentable
10997,BOOK X.,As any thou thyself art able
10998,BOOK X.,To find in all thy endless budget;
10999,BOOK X.,"With patience listen then, and judge it:"
11000,BOOK X.,For curs'd ill fortune now astride is
11001,BOOK X.,Across the back of poor Atrides;
11002,BOOK X.,"And Jove resolves, though e'er so stout."
11003,BOOK X.,With rubs and cuffs to wear him out;
11004,BOOK X.,"On my tir'd knees my body rocks,"
11005,BOOK X.,My heart against my liver knocks;
11006,BOOK X.,"On fifty things I poring keep,"
11007,BOOK X.,"But cannot get a wink of sleep,"
11008,BOOK X.,"And find myself so plaguy queer,"
11009,BOOK X.,"I'm neither easy here nor there,"
11010,BOOK X.,But dying with the mullygrubs
11011,BOOK X.,Because the Greeks have met such rubs.
11012,BOOK X.,"Now, if thy cunning nob should teem"
11013,BOOK X.,"With any pretty likely scheme,"
11014,BOOK X.,"How to repair this last day's scrubbing,"
11015,BOOK X.,"And save us such another drubbing,"
11016,BOOK X.,Give us your good advice with speed--
11017,BOOK X.,A friend in need's a friend indeed--
11018,BOOK X.,"And then, old buff, we'll go together"
11019,BOOK X.,To hearten those who're watching whether
11020,BOOK X.,These damn'd infernal Trojan tartars
11021,BOOK X.,May not by night beat up our quarters.
11022,BOOK X.,
11023,BOOK X.,"Th' old cock replies, I've often said it,"
11024,BOOK X.,You must give Jove a little credit;
11025,BOOK X.,"He's sometimes cross, but, all together,"
11026,BOOK X.,He best can rule both wind and weather:
11027,BOOK X.,"This Hector, though he hector now,"
11028,BOOK X.,God help his soul! what will he do
11029,BOOK X.,When bold Achilles comes to fight him?
11030,BOOK X.,"I'll answer for't, he'll soon b-sh-te him."
11031,BOOK X.,"Be that as't may, just here I stand"
11032,BOOK X.,Your humble servant at command;
11033,BOOK X.,But let us summon for this bout
11034,BOOK X.,Some other bucks to help us out;
11035,BOOK X.,"That canting lying rogue Ulysses,"
11036,BOOK X.,"At such a woeful pinch as this is,"
11037,BOOK X.,Will help us greatly with his cunning;
11038,BOOK X.,"Then bold Oileus, fam'd for running;"
11039,BOOK X.,"There's Meges too, a strong-back'd whelp,"
11040,BOOK X.,"With Diomede, will lend us help."
11041,BOOK X.,"But let some other spark, d'ye see,"
11042,BOOK X.,"With nimbler heels than you or me,"
11043,BOOK X.,"Run to the other end o' th' fleet,"
11044,BOOK X.,"And call the constable of Crete,"
11045,BOOK X.,"With bully Ajax, or some other:"
11046,BOOK X.,"I'll rouse that drowsy whelp your brother,"
11047,BOOK X.,And hear what lame excuse he'll make
11048,BOOK X.,For snoring when he should awake.
11049,BOOK X.,"Now, as these broils were of his brewing,"
11050,BOOK X.,"He ought to do what you are doing,"
11051,BOOK X.,"Should keep himself upon the peep,"
11052,BOOK X.,And share in work as well as sleep;
11053,BOOK X.,"For, at this dreadful pinch of pinches,"
11054,BOOK X.,We all are lost if one man flinches.
11055,BOOK X.,
11056,BOOK X.,To whom the king: Without dispute
11057,BOOK X.,"You're often right, but now you're out;"
11058,BOOK X.,"My brother is, to speak the truth,"
11059,BOOK X.,"A very modest, harmless youth,"
11060,BOOK X.,"And ne'er presumes to take the lead,"
11061,BOOK X.,Because he knows that I'm the head:
11062,BOOK X.,"But when his leader shows the way,"
11063,BOOK X.,He's always ready to obey.
11064,BOOK X.,"You blame him oft, which you are right in,"
11065,BOOK X.,"For loving whoring more than fighting,"
11066,BOOK X.,Although 'tis what we all delight in.
11067,BOOK X.,But yesterday's confounded scramble
11068,BOOK X.,So made his great and small guts wamble
11069,BOOK X.,"He could not lie in bed, not he,"
11070,BOOK X.,"So up he got, and call'd on me;"
11071,BOOK X.,"Then posted forward, with intention"
11072,BOOK X.,To rouse the very whelps you mention;
11073,BOOK X.,"And whilst we idly here are prating,"
11074,BOOK X.,I'll hold a tester they are waiting
11075,BOOK X.,"At th' alehouse underneath the wall,"
11076,BOOK X.,"Where I a council bade them call,"
11077,BOOK X.,And speak some hot-pots for us all.
11078,BOOK X.,"There they may sit secure and snug,"
11079,BOOK X.,The watchmen for a single mug
11080,BOOK X.,"Will look so sharp, you need not fear 'em,"
11081,BOOK X.,They'll let no Trojan rogues come near 'em.
11082,BOOK X.,
11083,BOOK X.,"Hot-pots! says Nestor. By Apollo,"
11084,BOOK X.,"If that's the case, we'll quickly follow:"
11085,BOOK X.,I'll in a twinkling put my coat on:
11086,BOOK X.,"These jobs, the moment they are thought on,"
11087,BOOK X.,"Should be perform'd as soon as told,"
11088,BOOK X.,Or else the hot-pots may grow cold.
11089,BOOK X.,
11090,BOOK X.,"With that his gummy eyes he washes,"
11091,BOOK X.,"And cas'd his legs in spatterdashes,"
11092,BOOK X.,Then on his arms began to pull
11093,BOOK X.,An old red waistcoat lin'd with wool;
11094,BOOK X.,And ere he left the tent he took
11095,BOOK X.,A sapling of the toughest oak.
11096,BOOK X.,"Then through the drowsy crowd he pass'd,"
11097,BOOK X.,And call'd Ulysses out in haste;
11098,BOOK X.,"Ulysses starting heard his voice,"
11099,BOOK X.,And ran to see who made such noise.
11100,BOOK X.,
11101,BOOK X.,"Old dad, says Ithacus, I'm sorry"
11102,BOOK X.,To find your beard in such a hurry;
11103,BOOK X.,You must be in a woeful fright
11104,BOOK X.,To wander out so late at night;
11105,BOOK X.,"Those scoundrel rogues of reformation,"
11106,BOOK X.,"The pest of ours and ev'ry nation,"
11107,BOOK X.,"Durst hardly, though so vile a crew,"
11108,BOOK X.,Disturb so grave a man as you.
11109,BOOK X.,
11110,BOOK X.,When Nestor answers: Our bad station
11111,BOOK X.,Requires indeed a reformation:
11112,BOOK X.,"But though thy cunning pate, Ulysses,"
11113,BOOK X.,"To trace out knowledge seldom misses,"
11114,BOOK X.,"In whatsoever shape she dwells,"
11115,BOOK X.,As folks guess eggs by seeing shells;
11116,BOOK X.,Yet now you're plaguy wide o' th' mark:
11117,BOOK X.,"For, let me tell you, ev'ry spark"
11118,BOOK X.,Of rogu'ry in your crafty nob
11119,BOOK X.,We want to mend this last day's job;
11120,BOOK X.,"All the calves' brains that Jove e'er gave us,"
11121,BOOK X.,Must be employ'd this night to save us.
11122,BOOK X.,"We must, 'fore George! before 'tis day,"
11123,BOOK X.,"Resolve to fight, or run away:"
11124,BOOK X.,"And if it should be found, upon"
11125,BOOK X.,"A consultation, we should run,"
11126,BOOK X.,"As I am fearful we must mog off,"
11127,BOOK X.,"The sooner then, my friends, we jog off"
11128,BOOK X.,The better; for when folks depart
11129,BOOK X.,Incog. they always choose good start.
11130,BOOK X.,
11131,BOOK X.,The moment that Ulysses heard
11132,BOOK X.,"This speech from honest grizzle-beard,"
11133,BOOK X.,"He turn'd upon his heel, and went"
11134,BOOK X.,"To fetch his pot-lid from his tent,"
11135,BOOK X.,"Made of a curious old coach-pannel,"
11136,BOOK X.,"Painted without, and lin'd with flannel;"
11137,BOOK X.,"Then join'd the noble captains twain,"
11138,BOOK X.,And trotted with them o'er the plain.
11139,BOOK X.,Quickly bold Diomede they found
11140,BOOK X.,"Close by his tent, upon the ground,"
11141,BOOK X.,With all his bloods and bucks around:
11142,BOOK X.,"But that no man would trust him much,"
11143,BOOK X.,"The figure of his crew was such,"
11144,BOOK X.,You'd think the chief had got a pack
11145,BOOK X.,Of bailiff's followers at his back.
11146,BOOK X.,"In spite of fear they slept secure,"
11147,BOOK X.,"A mile, at least, you'd hear 'em snore;"
11148,BOOK X.,Around the circle stood a row
11149,BOOK X.,"Of broomstaves, stuck upright for show."
11150,BOOK X.,"The honest Grecian, void of pride,"
11151,BOOK X.,"Lay snug upon an old cow-hide,"
11152,BOOK X.,And for a pillow roll'd a piece
11153,BOOK X.,Of linsey-woolsey brought from Greece;
11154,BOOK X.,Old goody Nestor with his foot
11155,BOOK X.,Gave him a d---d hard kick o' th' gut
11156,BOOK X.,"To wake him, but could hardly do't;"
11157,BOOK X.,Then halloos to the snoring tup:
11158,BOOK X.,For God's sake fall a-getting up!
11159,BOOK X.,"How can you lie, you sleepy dog,"
11160,BOOK X.,Snoring like Farmer Blake's fat hog?
11161,BOOK X.,"Whilst all your comrades, though they're drunk so,"
11162,BOOK X.,Can't get a wink of sleep they funk so
11163,BOOK X.,Because Troy's rogues on yonder hill
11164,BOOK X.,Can lug your ears just when they will.
11165,BOOK X.,
11166,BOOK X.,"Tydides, in a mighty pother,"
11167,BOOK X.,"Pull'd one eye open, then the other;"
11168,BOOK X.,"Then to old grey-beard 'gan to swear,"
11169,BOOK X.,D--n your old soul! what brought you here?
11170,BOOK X.,"If 'tis resolv'd no man shall sleep,"
11171,BOOK X.,"But ev'ry buck on guard must keep,"
11172,BOOK X.,"Send younger puppies to awake 'em,"
11173,BOOK X.,Your gouty legs can't undertake 'em;
11174,BOOK X.,"They sleep so sound that you must kick 'em,"
11175,BOOK X.,Or take a corking pin to prick 'em.
11176,BOOK X.,
11177,BOOK X.,"Nestor replies; My friend, d'ye see,"
11178,BOOK X.,I thank you for your care of me:
11179,BOOK X.,"I might, I know, have got my son"
11180,BOOK X.,"To do what I've at present done,"
11181,BOOK X.,"Or, if no better could be had,"
11182,BOOK X.,They offer'd me the butcher's lad;
11183,BOOK X.,"But matters now so bad are grown,"
11184,BOOK X.,That we no noddles but our own
11185,BOOK X.,"Can trust; affairs are out of joint,"
11186,BOOK X.,"We stand upon a needle's point,"
11187,BOOK X.,And therefore each in this disaster
11188,BOOK X.,"Must show himself a balance-master,"
11189,BOOK X.,Like Prussia's king; for in this jumble
11190,BOOK X.,If we don't stand we're sure to tumble.
11191,BOOK X.,"Yet, as you think I'm grown too old"
11192,BOOK X.,"To trudge about in nights so cold,"
11193,BOOK X.,So soon as you have don'd your brogues
11194,BOOK X.,"Jog off, and rouse the other rogues:"
11195,BOOK X.,Thy nimbler heels may useful be;
11196,BOOK X.,"Serving the state, is serving me."
11197,BOOK X.,"By different roads men serve the state,"
11198,BOOK X.,"Some ply their heels, and some their pate:"
11199,BOOK X.,"When jobs are doing for the court,"
11200,BOOK X.,"And statesmen fear that ayes run short,"
11201,BOOK X.,Some loon's employ'd t' amuse the house
11202,BOOK X.,"With a fine speech not worth a louse,"
11203,BOOK X.,Asks if the king bestow'd that post on
11204,BOOK X.,"A proper man, to make the most on"
11205,BOOK X.,The pious canting knaves at Boston;
11206,BOOK X.,Or if the India Company
11207,BOOK X.,This year must pay another fee;
11208,BOOK X.,Whilst S--l--n's nimble heels begin
11209,BOOK X.,"To fetch the ayes by dozens in,"
11210,BOOK X.,"Searches all holes, you need not fear him,"
11211,BOOK X.,"And ev'ry bawdy-house that's near him,"
11212,BOOK X.,"Takes no excuse, but makes them limp in,"
11213,BOOK X.,"And leave all bus'ness, though they're pimping."
11214,BOOK X.,
11215,BOOK X.,"[Illustration: Book X, page 232."
11216,BOOK X.,"Away to Meges' tent he steers,"
11217,BOOK X.,"And laid fast hold on both his ears,"
11218,BOOK X.,"Gave his cod's-head a hearty shake,"
11219,BOOK X.,Then kick'd the lesser Ajax 'wake.]
11220,BOOK X.,
11221,BOOK X.,He said; when lo! the valiant knight
11222,BOOK X.,Jump'd from his cow-skin bolt upright;
11223,BOOK X.,Then with a wooden skewer did pin
11224,BOOK X.,"Across his back a shaggy skin,"
11225,BOOK X.,Which he had plunder'd in great wrath
11226,BOOK X.,From an old lion starv'd to death;
11227,BOOK X.,"Then grasp'd a cudgel in his hand,"
11228,BOOK X.,And scour'd full speed along the strand.
11229,BOOK X.,"Away to Meges' tent he steers,"
11230,BOOK X.,"And laid fast hold on both his ears,"
11231,BOOK X.,"Gave his cod's head a hearty shake,"
11232,BOOK X.,"Then kick'd the lesser Ajax' wake,"
11233,BOOK X.,"Help'd 'em to fumble on their shoes,"
11234,BOOK X.,"Then hied to the place of rendezvous,"
11235,BOOK X.,"A penny pot-house, known by all,"
11236,BOOK X.,And by 'em call'd the Hole i' th' Wall.
11237,BOOK X.,
11238,BOOK X.,And now the chiefs approach'd the gate
11239,BOOK X.,"Where twenty ragged sentries sat,"
11240,BOOK X.,"A sharp look-out the knaves did keep,"
11241,BOOK X.,Fear would not let them fall asleep.
11242,BOOK X.,"Thus have I seen, if right I judge it,"
11243,BOOK X.,A cur-dog guard a tinker's budget;
11244,BOOK X.,"The thief to steal the budget tries,"
11245,BOOK X.,Yet cannot gain the weighty prize:
11246,BOOK X.,"Turn as he may, do what he will,"
11247,BOOK X.,The mongrel guards the budget still:
11248,BOOK X.,Just so these loons at ev'ry sound
11249,BOOK X.,Would whip their eyes and ears around;
11250,BOOK X.,"Though the least noise did so affright 'em,"
11251,BOOK X.,It made the better half besh--e 'em.
11252,BOOK X.,"Old Nestor joy'd to find 'em wake,"
11253,BOOK X.,And each man by the hand did shake;
11254,BOOK X.,"Though, had his nose been worth the keeping,"
11255,BOOK X.,He soon had smelt what barr'd their sleeping:
11256,BOOK X.,"However, at his usual rate"
11257,BOOK X.,The good old soul began to prate:
11258,BOOK X.,
11259,BOOK X.,"My boys, says he, if thus you watch,"
11260,BOOK X.,These Trojan rogues will meet their match:
11261,BOOK X.,"But if you slack your hands a jot,"
11262,BOOK X.,I'll venture to be hang'd or shot
11263,BOOK X.,if ev'ry soul don't go to pot!
11264,BOOK X.,
11265,BOOK X.,"Just as he spoke, this queer old bitch"
11266,BOOK X.,Gave a great jump across the ditch;
11267,BOOK X.,"His comrades follow'd on a heap,"
11268,BOOK X.,"Some straddled o'er, but most did leap--"
11269,BOOK X.,"All but great Ajax, slow and stout,"
11270,BOOK X.,"He tumbled in, then rumbled out:"
11271,BOOK X.,"Last Merion came in mighty fuss,"
11272,BOOK X.,Join'd with that whelp Antilochus.
11273,BOOK X.,"A place they found, which all that day"
11274,BOOK X.,"Had shar'd but little cudgel-play,"
11275,BOOK X.,"The very spot, as we conjecture,"
11276,BOOK X.,Where Mistress Night stopp'd bully Hector;
11277,BOOK X.,"And had he not been so o'ertaken,"
11278,BOOK X.,Nought could have say'd the Grecians' bacon
11279,BOOK X.,"Nor would he, since he'd got his hand in,"
11280,BOOK X.,Have left a single Grecian standing:
11281,BOOK X.,No other spot on all the plains
11282,BOOK X.,"Was free from blood, and mud, and brains."
11283,BOOK X.,"Here they sat down, when Nestor's tongue"
11284,BOOK X.,Its usual kind of larum rung.
11285,BOOK X.,
11286,BOOK X.,"Is there, says he, a heart of oak"
11287,BOOK X.,"'Mongst us, is there a bully rock"
11288,BOOK X.,"Dares steal into the Trojan camp,"
11289,BOOK X.,"Without the aid of link or lamp,"
11290,BOOK X.,"To seize some straggler in the dark,"
11291,BOOK X.,"Or listen, and their counsel mark,"
11292,BOOK X.,"Whether they think we've got enough,"
11293,BOOK X.,Or still design to work our buff?
11294,BOOK X.,"This could he learn, and tell our peers,"
11295,BOOK X.,"And safe return with both his ears,"
11296,BOOK X.,What an amazing share of glory
11297,BOOK X.,"Would fall to him in future story,"
11298,BOOK X.,When good old wives shall tell the tale
11299,BOOK X.,O'er roasted eggs and butter'd ale!
11300,BOOK X.,"Beside, his country would bestow"
11301,BOOK X.,"A quarter guinea, if not two;"
11302,BOOK X.,And he should always have th' first cut on
11303,BOOK X.,Our Sunday's leg of rotten mutton.
11304,BOOK X.,
11305,BOOK X.,He spoke; when lo! the goddess Fear
11306,BOOK X.,"Bid with so pale a face appear,"
11307,BOOK X.,"It made 'em look confounded queer,"
11308,BOOK X.,"All but the bold Tydides, who"
11309,BOOK X.,"Brawls out, By Jupiter I'll go,"
11310,BOOK X.,"In spite of your pale phiz, and try"
11311,BOOK X.,What weighty matters I can spy:
11312,BOOK X.,"Within my breast a spirit lies,"
11313,BOOK X.,That tells me I shall steal some prize
11314,BOOK X.,Not such a spright as moves the quaker
11315,BOOK X.,"To preach to sister Ruth, then take her"
11316,BOOK X.,Into some private place and shake her--
11317,BOOK X.,"Mine is a knowing honest spright,"
11318,BOOK X.,As true as Highland second-sight.
11319,BOOK X.,"But though I'm not afraid, yet mind me,"
11320,BOOK X.,"A trusty comrade you must find me,"
11321,BOOK X.,"Because, by ev'ry fool 'tis known,"
11322,BOOK X.,Two heads are twice as good as one:
11323,BOOK X.,"When one stands forward, one abaft,"
11324,BOOK X.,"They spy all matters, fore and aft:"
11325,BOOK X.,"What's right ahead I need but mind,"
11326,BOOK X.,My friend looks sharp to all behind.
11327,BOOK X.,"Then if we fall into a scrape,"
11328,BOOK X.,We help each other to escape;
11329,BOOK X.,"When one poor thief goes out alone,"
11330,BOOK X.,"I've known him like a devil run,"
11331,BOOK X.,"And burst himself, before he feels"
11332,BOOK X.,There's nought but conscience at his heels:
11333,BOOK X.,"But when there's two, we know for certain"
11334,BOOK X.,A scoundrel can a scoundrel hearten.
11335,BOOK X.,"If that's the case with thieves, pray then,"
11336,BOOK X.,What won't it do for honest men?
11337,BOOK X.,
11338,BOOK X.,"The moment this harangue was done,"
11339,BOOK X.,Up jump'd the captains ev'ry one:
11340,BOOK X.,"For, as one man was only wanted,"
11341,BOOK X.,That each would 'scape they took for granted.
11342,BOOK X.,"I'll go, says bully Ajax, d--n me!"
11343,BOOK X.,"And I, says little Ajax, slam me!"
11344,BOOK X.,"Cries Merion, with a furious nod,"
11345,BOOK X.,"I'll venture my calf-skin, by G-d!"
11346,BOOK X.,"Then roar'd out chatt'ring Nestor's son,"
11347,BOOK X.,Sowse my old pluck but I'll make one!
11348,BOOK X.,At which the cuckold Menelau
11349,BOOK X.,"Shrugg'd up his breeks, and swore he'd go."
11350,BOOK X.,"That crafty dog, Ulysses, knowing"
11351,BOOK X.,Great odds would be against his going.
11352,BOOK X.,"Puts on his fighting face, and cries,"
11353,BOOK X.,"I'll take my chance, boys, smite my eyes!"
11354,BOOK X.,"When thus great Agamemnon bellows,"
11355,BOOK X.,"Now, by my soul, you're clever fellows!"
11356,BOOK X.,But the bold Diomede himself
11357,BOOK X.,Must point us out what sturdy elf
11358,BOOK X.,"Will likeliest be to stand the test,"
11359,BOOK X.,And back his knotty pate the best.
11360,BOOK X.,"Therefore, sans favour and affection,"
11361,BOOK X.,"Take thou, my boy, thy own election;"
11362,BOOK X.,"'Twixt man and man, pay thou no def'rence,"
11363,BOOK X.,"Nor give to any lord the pref'rence,"
11364,BOOK X.,"Unless it suit thy own accord,"
11365,BOOK X.,But not because he is a lord;
11366,BOOK X.,"For you, as well as I, can scan"
11367,BOOK X.,Ribands and stars can't make a man;
11368,BOOK X.,A lord will never prove your friend.
11369,BOOK X.,Unless you can yourself defend;
11370,BOOK X.,"If you're in want of help, he's sure"
11371,BOOK X.,To bid his porter shut the door.
11372,BOOK X.,"The gen'ral thus his fears did smother,"
11373,BOOK X.,Lest he should choose his loving brother.
11374,BOOK X.,
11375,BOOK X.,"Then thus says Diomede the steady,"
11376,BOOK X.,"My lord, I've made my choice already;"
11377,BOOK X.,"Nor think my judgement much amiss is,"
11378,BOOK X.,When I declare I choose Ulysses.
11379,BOOK X.,"They tell me I have spunk enough,"
11380,BOOK X.,"But he can plot as well as cuff,"
11381,BOOK X.,Which makes the Trojans more afraid
11382,BOOK X.,Of his queer noddle than his blade.
11383,BOOK X.,Guarded by such a bold defender
11384,BOOK X.,"I'll face Old Nick, or, if he'll send her,"
11385,BOOK X.,Get twins upon the witch of Endor.
11386,BOOK X.,
11387,BOOK X.,"Ulysses cries, My friend, hush! hush!"
11388,BOOK X.,You'll make a modest fellow blush;
11389,BOOK X.,"None but a courtier, or his Grace,"
11390,BOOK X.,Can bear such praising to his face.
11391,BOOK X.,"But whilst we chatter thus and prate,"
11392,BOOK X.,We never dream it grows so late;
11393,BOOK X.,"White streaks the blueish sky do wrinkle,"
11394,BOOK X.,And the north star begins to twinkle;
11395,BOOK X.,"If any thing we think of doing,"
11396,BOOK X.,"'Tis time, by Jove, we should be going."
11397,BOOK X.,
11398,BOOK X.,No sooner was it said than done:
11399,BOOK X.,They whipp'd their greasy buff-coats on;
11400,BOOK X.,"When Thrasymede, a man of note,"
11401,BOOK X.,"A potlid and a broomstick brought,"
11402,BOOK X.,Which he the varlet Diom. lent;
11403,BOOK X.,"Then for an old church-bucket sent,"
11404,BOOK X.,With dirt and mouldy grease o'erspread;
11405,BOOK X.,This serv'd to case his leather head.
11406,BOOK X.,Ulysses next was fitted out
11407,BOOK X.,With a tough broomshaft for this bout;
11408,BOOK X.,"When Merion, that he nought might lack,"
11409,BOOK X.,Hung him a bow upon his back;
11410,BOOK X.,"And then, to guard his paper skull,"
11411,BOOK X.,"Lent him a cap well lin'd with wool,"
11412,BOOK X.,"A cap made wondrous fine before,"
11413,BOOK X.,With two grim tushes of a boar--
11414,BOOK X.,"This skull-cap, though not worth a louse,"
11415,BOOK X.,Was stole by one Autolycus
11416,BOOK X.,"From rich Amyntor, and the knave"
11417,BOOK X.,The prize to Amphidamus gave;
11418,BOOK X.,"To Molus, Amphidamus lent it,"
11419,BOOK X.,And he to valiant Merion sent it;
11420,BOOK X.,By Merion it was given now
11421,BOOK X.,To guard this sly old soaker's brow.
11422,BOOK X.,
11423,BOOK X.,"Away they went, though half bepist,"
11424,BOOK X.,And trotted through a thick Scotch mist;
11425,BOOK X.,"When, from the middle of a bush,"
11426,BOOK X.,"With noise and flutter, out did rush"
11427,BOOK X.,"A bird, so large and fierce, it made"
11428,BOOK X.,This pair of bully Greeks afraid:
11429,BOOK X.,
11430,BOOK X.,[Illustration: Book X. page 242.
11431,BOOK X.,"When, from the middle of a bush,"

11435,BOOK X.,
11436,BOOK X.,Though 'twas so dark they could not 'spy
11437,BOOK X.,"What bird it was by th' naked eye,"
11438,BOOK X.,"Yet quickly, by the voice they heard,"
11439,BOOK X.,'Twas a Scotch nightingale that scar'd
11440,BOOK X.,"Their valiant hearts so much, that they"
11441,BOOK X.,Had turn'd about to run away;
11442,BOOK X.,"When sly Ulysses, vex'd to th' soul"
11443,BOOK X.,"To be so frighten'd by an owl,"
11444,BOOK X.,Like a queer rogue did quickly start up
11445,BOOK X.,"A special scheme to keep his heart up,"
11446,BOOK X.,"Swore it would be a lucky night,"
11447,BOOK X.,Because she took a turn to the right--
11448,BOOK X.,"Had she to the left hand made a ring,"
11449,BOOK X.,He still had sworn the self-same thing.
11450,BOOK X.,"But here we do not find he stopp'd,"
11451,BOOK X.,For on his kneppers down he dropp'd;
11452,BOOK X.,"Then, like a canting knave in town,"
11453,BOOK X.,Cock'd one eye up and t'other down.
11454,BOOK X.,
11455,BOOK X.,"Daughter, says he, of thund'ring Jove,"
11456,BOOK X.,Who holds you all in awe above
11457,BOOK X.,"(For, did he not the scales keep even,"
11458,BOOK X.,"You'd out o' th' windows throw all heaven),"
11459,BOOK X.,Thou who hast aided my escape
11460,BOOK X.,"From many a bitter bang and scrape,"
11461,BOOK X.,"Assist us, whilst this night we roam"
11462,BOOK X.,To steal and carry something home!
11463,BOOK X.,That Trojans yet unborn may rue
11464,BOOK X.,The loss of goods they never knew.
11465,BOOK X.,
11466,BOOK X.,"Then Diomede began to pray,"
11467,BOOK X.,But spoke just as a man may say:
11468,BOOK X.,"Daughter of Jove, began he too,"
11469,BOOK X.,"Why may'nt I say my prayers to you,"
11470,BOOK X.,As well as this queer dog Ulysses?
11471,BOOK X.,"Who, I've a notion, never misses"
11472,BOOK X.,"To pray for aught that he may want,"
11473,BOOK X.,Because you seldom fail to grant;
11474,BOOK X.,"And therefore, as he leads the way,"
11475,BOOK X.,"I'll try a spell how I can pray,"
11476,BOOK X.,"Though, being us'd so little to't,"
11477,BOOK X.,I shall be damn'd hard switch'd to do't;
11478,BOOK X.,"And would much rather, you are sure,"
11479,BOOK X.,Box a whole week than pray an hour.--
11480,BOOK X.,"But stop--ahem, I have it now:"
11481,BOOK X.,"Daughter of thund'ring Jove, as you"
11482,BOOK X.,"Did often help my little dad,"
11483,BOOK X.,I hope you won't forsake his lad;
11484,BOOK X.,For when to Thebes he took a walk
11485,BOOK X.,With their chief constable to talk--
11486,BOOK X.,He went ambassador from Greece
11487,BOOK X.,"To make, or else to patch, a peace;"
11488,BOOK X.,"For in those days, our records show,"
11489,BOOK X.,Peace might be patch'd as well as now;
11490,BOOK X.,"But though he spoke in peaceful fashion,"
11491,BOOK X.,"They quickly put him in a passion,"
11492,BOOK X.,"On which he drubb'd those foes to Greece,"
11493,BOOK X.,And gave them two black eyes a-piece--
11494,BOOK X.,"Now, as thou didst my father help,"
11495,BOOK X.,"Pr'ythee assist his hopeful whelp,"
11496,BOOK X.,"And, by my soul, as I'm a sinner,"
11497,BOOK X.,I'll ask you to a handsome dinner;
11498,BOOK X.,"I'll kill a cow both fat and good,"
11499,BOOK X.,And you shall have the guts and blood!
11500,BOOK X.,
11501,BOOK X.,"Thus Diomede, though hard put to't,"
11502,BOOK X.,A middling prayer at last made out;
11503,BOOK X.,"And Pallas, be it plain appears,"
11504,BOOK X.,Listen'd to both with her ears.
11505,BOOK X.,"Then, like two hungry half-starv'd cats,"
11506,BOOK X.,"Who long to be amongst the rats,"
11507,BOOK X.,"They crept, as if they trod on eggs,"
11508,BOOK X.,Through heaps of mangled arms and legs.
11509,BOOK X.,
11510,BOOK X.,"Now Hector, from the close of day,"
11511,BOOK X.,"Was looking sharp as well as they,"
11512,BOOK X.,"And would sleep none, you need not doubt him,"
11513,BOOK X.,And call'd his bloods and bucks about him;
11514,BOOK X.,When thus the mighty Trojan Broughton
11515,BOOK X.,Began a speech they little thought on:
11516,BOOK X.,"My lads, says he, I would not wrong ye,"
11517,BOOK X.,"But, I'm afraid, there's not among ye"
11518,BOOK X.,A brave bold-hearted buck that's willing
11519,BOOK X.,"To risque his ears, and earn a shilling"
11520,BOOK X.,"By looking sharp among these fighters,"
11521,BOOK X.,And learn what's doing in their lighters;
11522,BOOK X.,"Spy if a proper watch they keep,"
11523,BOOK X.,Or like good city watchmen sleep;
11524,BOOK X.,"What resolution is begun,"
11525,BOOK X.,Whether the rogues will stand or run?
11526,BOOK X.,By him that rolls the rumbling thunder!
11527,BOOK X.,I'll give him choice of all the plunder:
11528,BOOK X.,Himself shall choose from all the rest
11529,BOOK X.,The cart that suits his fancy best.
11530,BOOK X.,
11531,BOOK X.,"Just as he spoke, their eyes were all on"
11532,BOOK X.,"A simple youngster fix'd, called Dolon,"
11533,BOOK X.,"Who was, they say, the only lad"
11534,BOOK X.,The usurer Eumedes had;
11535,BOOK X.,"But he had five fine girls beside,"
11536,BOOK X.,As any man would wish to ride.--
11537,BOOK X.,"The boy had carts and horses store,"
11538,BOOK X.,And yet the bastard wanted more:
11539,BOOK X.,Though he was not so handsome quite
11540,BOOK X.,"As Molly ----'s catamite,"
11541,BOOK X.,Yet he had got (I scorn to wrong 'em)
11542,BOOK X.,The longest pair of legs among 'em.
11543,BOOK X.,
11544,BOOK X.,"Hector, says he, and puff'd his cheeks,"
11545,BOOK X.,I'll go among these sweaty Greeks:
11546,BOOK X.,"But hold your broomstaff in your hand,"
11547,BOOK X.,And swear to grant me my demand;
11548,BOOK X.,"For you must know, good Sir, my will is"
11549,BOOK X.,"To have the horses of Achilles,"
11550,BOOK X.,"And his fine cart with painted rails,"
11551,BOOK X.,All stuck with spanking great brass nails:
11552,BOOK X.,"Say but the word they shall be mine,"
11553,BOOK X.,I'll quickly smoke out their design;
11554,BOOK X.,"I'll steal, by such temptations led,"
11555,BOOK X.,Under their gen'ral's truckle-bed.
11556,BOOK X.,
11557,BOOK X.,His broomstaff then above his head
11558,BOOK X.,"Great Hector flourish'd, whilst he said:"
11559,BOOK X.,"Be witness thou, whose rumbling thunder"
11560,BOOK X.,"Makes wicked reprobates knock under,"
11561,BOOK X.,"Drives the vile scoundrels, helter skelter,"
11562,BOOK X.,"To ale and cyder vaults for shelter,"
11563,BOOK X.,"I promise, ere the Greeks we fall on,"
11564,BOOK X.,To give these nags to honest Dolon.
11565,BOOK X.,
11566,BOOK X.,"Thus Hector swore: but Jove, they say,"
11567,BOOK X.,Was looking then another way;
11568,BOOK X.,"Whether some bullock's guts were burning,"
11569,BOOK X.,And he that way his head was turning;
11570,BOOK X.,Or saw some ruddy country lass
11571,BOOK X.,"That took his eye so much, he was"
11572,BOOK X.,"Contriving how to get a grope-a,"
11573,BOOK X.,"Or bull her, as he did Europa--"
11574,BOOK X.,"Be that as't may, his chuckle head"
11575,BOOK X.,Heard not a word that Hector said.
11576,BOOK X.,
11577,BOOK X.,"Howe'er, the lad prepar'd to pack,"
11578,BOOK X.,"So slung his bow across his back,"
11579,BOOK X.,"Then o'er his narrow shoulders tied,"
11580,BOOK X.,"To keep him warm, a grey wolf's hide:"
11581,BOOK X.,"A brown fur cap, well lin'd within"
11582,BOOK X.,"With rabbit or else weazle's skin,"
11583,BOOK X.,"Serv'd his misshapen pate to grace,"
11584,BOOK X.,And cover'd half his weazle face:
11585,BOOK X.,"With an oak stick he grop'd the track,"
11586,BOOK X.,And went--but never yet came back.
11587,BOOK X.,
11588,BOOK X.,"A mile he walk'd not, nor three quarters,"
11589,BOOK X.,Before he met this pair of tartars:
11590,BOOK X.,"Ulysses, that sly lurching dog,"
11591,BOOK X.,"Heard first, and gave a gentle jog"
11592,BOOK X.,"To Diomede; then whisp'ring cries,"
11593,BOOK X.,"Flux me! but both my ears tell lies,"
11594,BOOK X.,If I don't hear a pair of feet
11595,BOOK X.,Come paddling this way to the fleet;
11596,BOOK X.,"Some peeping whelp, like us, a-going"
11597,BOOK X.,"To see what t'other side are doing,"
11598,BOOK X.,Or pilf'ring rogue stole out of bed
11599,BOOK X.,To pick the pockets of the dead.
11600,BOOK X.,"Be what he will, we'll here lie snug,"
11601,BOOK X.,"Let him but pass, we have him rug;"
11602,BOOK X.,Tor when we've got the heedless whelp
11603,BOOK X.,"So far, he can't roar out for help:"
11604,BOOK X.,"If he should run, do you but follow,"
11605,BOOK X.,I'll answer for't you'll beat him hollow:
11606,BOOK X.,"But if he slips you in the track,"
11607,BOOK X.,I'll stay and catch him coming back.
11608,BOOK X.,"At this they stepp'd among the grass,"
11609,BOOK X.,And stoop'd to let poor Dolon pass;
11610,BOOK X.,"Go where he would, these sharpers mind him,"
11611,BOOK X.,And follow pretty close behind him;
11612,BOOK X.,"There was not, could the eye have seen 'em,"
11613,BOOK X.,Above a rood of land between 'em.
11614,BOOK X.,"Now Dolon heard a sort of humming,"
11615,BOOK X.,But thought some messenger was coming
11616,BOOK X.,To fetch him back: but soon the lout
11617,BOOK X.,Began to smell the rascals out--
11618,BOOK X.,"Smell 'em, I say, because they tell us"
11619,BOOK X.,"The Greeks were dev'lish sweaty fellows,"
11620,BOOK X.,Therefore no wonder he so well
11621,BOOK X.,Could nose 'em by their frowsy smell--
11622,BOOK X.,On which a strong desire he feels
11623,BOOK X.,"To trust his good old friends, his heels."
11624,BOOK X.,"Away the long-legg'd varlet flew,"
11625,BOOK X.,"Whilst they, like staunch old hounds, pursue;"
11626,BOOK X.,"Cut short the ground he scamper'd over,"
11627,BOOK X.,And met him as he made to cover;
11628,BOOK X.,"And thus, in spite of all his heels,"
11629,BOOK X.,They drove him 'mongst the Grecian keels.
11630,BOOK X.,When Pallas came to Diomede--
11631,BOOK X.,"Says she, You run a hellish speed:"
11632,BOOK X.,"But this same spark, if I speak true, can"
11633,BOOK X.,"Run half as fast again as you can,"
11634,BOOK X.,"And, if a race you longer hazard,"
11635,BOOK X.,Split me but he will burst your mazzard!
11636,BOOK X.,"Then, when you've almost run him down,"
11637,BOOK X.,Some other Greek will crack his crown.
11638,BOOK X.,
11639,BOOK X.,At this he roars with threat'ning hand:
11640,BOOK X.,"You cursed dog, if you don't stand,"
11641,BOOK X.,"The moment that your long legs fail ye,"
11642,BOOK X.,Blast my old slippers but I'll nail ye!
11643,BOOK X.,"His trusty broomstaff then he threw,"
11644,BOOK X.,"Which over Dolon's shoulder flew,"
11645,BOOK X.,"But whizz'd so as it pass'd his ear,"
11646,BOOK X.,It stak'd him to the ground with fear.
11647,BOOK X.,"Trembling he stood a dev'lish odd piece,"
11648,BOOK X.,Whilst his teeth chatter'd in his c--piece;
11649,BOOK X.,"The bullies, almost burst with trying"
11650,BOOK X.,"T' outrun him, came and seiz'd him crying."
11651,BOOK X.,
11652,BOOK X.,"Blubb'ring, he roars, You see I wont"
11653,BOOK X.,Run any more; so pray ye don't
11654,BOOK X.,"Hurt a poor hopeful harmless lad,"
11655,BOOK X.,"And, I can tell you, my old dad"
11656,BOOK X.,Will give you each a half-peck hopper
11657,BOOK X.,Brimful of excellent good copper--
11658,BOOK X.,"None of your Birmingham affairs,"
11659,BOOK X.,"Nor any such-like shabrag wares,"
11660,BOOK X.,"But good new halfpence from the mint,"
11661,BOOK X.,With honest George's face in print.
11662,BOOK X.,My daddy all the copper handles
11663,BOOK X.,"That we receive for soap and candles,"
11664,BOOK X.,Picks out the good ones from the pack.
11665,BOOK X.,And turns the Birminghams all back;
11666,BOOK X.,"Or, if by chance a few are taken,"
11667,BOOK X.,He pops 'em off for cheese and bacon.
11668,BOOK X.,
11669,BOOK X.,"Uly, whose ears would bear no stopper"
11670,BOOK X.,"When money chink'd, although but copper,"
11671,BOOK X.,At present makes this queer reply:
11672,BOOK X.,"Be bold, my cock, don't fear to die:"
11673,BOOK X.,"But tell us why, instead of sleeping,"
11674,BOOK X.,You choose to spend your time in peeping.
11675,BOOK X.,Did Hector's bribes set you a-going
11676,BOOK X.,To find what business we were doing?
11677,BOOK X.,"Or by yourself, whilst all are snoring,"
11678,BOOK X.,You're got upon some scheme of whoring?
11679,BOOK X.,"Or are you some poor lousy soul,"
11680,BOOK X.,"Sprung up from Hockley in the Hole,"
11681,BOOK X.,"Come to steal waistcoats from the dead,"
11682,BOOK X.,"To pawn for porter, cheese, and bread?"
11683,BOOK X.,"Tell us, my boy, and tell us true,"
11684,BOOK X.,And then you'll see what we shall do.
11685,BOOK X.,
11686,BOOK X.,"Whilst Dolon took some time to pause,"
11687,BOOK X.,"His grinders rattling in his jaws,"
11688,BOOK X.,With doleful phiz at last he speaks:
11689,BOOK X.,"I'll tell you all, thrice worthy Greeks!"
11690,BOOK X.,"'Twas Hector, curse his pimpled face!"
11691,BOOK X.,That sent me to this luckless place;
11692,BOOK X.,"He promis'd me, confound his brags!"
11693,BOOK X.,That pair of flaming pye-bald nags
11694,BOOK X.,Achilles bought of Farmer Saul:
11695,BOOK X.,He promis'd me the cart and all.
11696,BOOK X.,"Those damn'd brass lacquer'd nails that shine,"
11697,BOOK X.,"And made his cart so flaming fine,"
11698,BOOK X.,Tempted my loggerhead to come
11699,BOOK X.,"And leave a good warm bed at home,"
11700,BOOK X.,Only to find if Madam Fear
11701,BOOK X.,"Had made you run, or kept you here;"
11702,BOOK X.,Or if there was a chance of snapping
11703,BOOK X.,A proper time to catch you napping.
11704,BOOK X.,
11705,BOOK X.,"Body o' me! Ulysses cries,"
11706,BOOK X.,You ask'd the devil of a prize;
11707,BOOK X.,How could'st thou be so strangely flamm'd?
11708,BOOK X.,Thou drive his horses? thou be d--d!
11709,BOOK X.,"Did you not know, you stupid elf,"
11710,BOOK X.,"No man alive, except himself,"
11711,BOOK X.,"Can either drive his tits, or catch 'em?"
11712,BOOK X.,Bever himself could never match 'em.
11713,BOOK X.,"But he can stop 'em with a twitch,"
11714,BOOK X.,'Cause got upon a water-witch;
11715,BOOK X.,"Had he been mortal man, I know,"
11716,BOOK X.,They'd broke his neck some years ago.
11717,BOOK X.,"But, if you'd have me your protector,"
11718,BOOK X.,Say where the great kill-devil Hector
11719,BOOK X.,Goes ev'ry night to drink a pot;
11720,BOOK X.,How many geldings has he got?
11721,BOOK X.,"For, whilst the drunken ostlers nod,"
11722,BOOK X.,"We'll steal 'em if we can, by G-d!"
11723,BOOK X.,Where do the other captains sleep?
11724,BOOK X.,How many watchmen do they keep?
11725,BOOK X.,"But tell us truly, whilst you're doing,"
11726,BOOK X.,What kind of mischief they are brewing;
11727,BOOK X.,"Whether they'll stay to cut our throats,"
11728,BOOK X.,"And burn our crazy rotten boats,"
11729,BOOK X.,Or think 'tis better to employ
11730,BOOK X.,Their strength to guard their whore's-nest Troy.
11731,BOOK X.,
11732,BOOK X.,"Thus spake Ulysses; and this Dolon,"
11733,BOOK X.,"Whom these two rogues design'd to fall on,"
11734,BOOK X.,"Cries, like a coward son of whore,"
11735,BOOK X.,"I'll tell you all the truth, and more:"
11736,BOOK X.,"Upon a grave-stone near yon farm,"
11737,BOOK X.,"Kicking their heels to keep them warm,"
11738,BOOK X.,"I left the captains all with Hector,"
11739,BOOK X.,"Clubbing their pates, as I conjecture,"
11740,BOOK X.,How they may rid the Trojan shores
11741,BOOK X.,Of all you Grecian sons of whores:
11742,BOOK X.,"As to the watchmen, a small share"
11743,BOOK X.,"Are thinly scatter'd here and there,"
11744,BOOK X.,"And e'en those few that watch should keep,"
11745,BOOK X.,"Like city watchmen, soundly sleep,"
11746,BOOK X.,"The Trojans guard the sentry boxes,"
11747,BOOK X.,For fear the Greeks should trim their doxies;
11748,BOOK X.,"But all the foreigners, who're come"
11749,BOOK X.,"To help us, left their wives at home;"
11750,BOOK X.,"For, as one woman caus'd the rout"
11751,BOOK X.,"That all this mischief is about,"
11752,BOOK X.,"Should we our wenches bring, think they,"
11753,BOOK X.,The devil then will be to pay;
11754,BOOK X.,"For mischief's never in perfection,"
11755,BOOK X.,Unless when under their direction:
11756,BOOK X.,"Therefore in leaving them, we find,"
11757,BOOK X.,"They left their greatest plagues behind,"
11758,BOOK X.,And now they sleep as free from care
11759,BOOK X.,As if your Greekships were not near.
11760,BOOK X.,
11761,BOOK X.,"Then, says Ulysses, tell, I pray,"
11762,BOOK X.,Where do these sleeping fellows lay;
11763,BOOK X.,"Amongst the Trojans do they snore,"
11764,BOOK X.,Or by themselves along the shore?
11765,BOOK X.,
11766,BOOK X.,"I'll tell you all, replies the spy,"
11767,BOOK X.,And how their raggamuffins lie:
11768,BOOK X.,"The Peons first, who shoot their arrows"
11769,BOOK X.,"So true, they hit tom-tits or sparrows;"
11770,BOOK X.,"The Carians, sharp as wolves or falcons"
11771,BOOK X.,At beef and pudding; then the Caucons
11772,BOOK X.,"With the Pelasgians, hardy mortals"
11773,BOOK X.,"At drinking punch, and eating turtles--"
11774,BOOK X.,"A task that they perform so well,"
11775,BOOK X.,All corporations they excel;
11776,BOOK X.,By them great **** would be beat in
11777,BOOK X.,"Both guzzling punch, and turtle-eating."
11778,BOOK X.,"As for the Leleges, they lie"
11779,BOOK X.,"Along the shore; and pretty nigh,"
11780,BOOK X.,"A little higher, snores the Lycian,"
11781,BOOK X.,"With the Mæonian, and the Mycian."
11782,BOOK X.,"Quite snug, near Thymbra's old mud wall,"
11783,BOOK X.,The Phrygian horse are there; and all
11784,BOOK X.,"The Thracians pig in by themselves,"
11785,BOOK X.,"A set of roaring, sturdy elves,"
11786,BOOK X.,"That came last night, led on by Rhesus,"
11787,BOOK X.,A fellow twice as rich as Crœsus:
11788,BOOK X.,In your born days you never saw
11789,BOOK X.,"Such milk-white tits, they beat the snow;"
11790,BOOK X.,"With silver all his cart is grac'd,"
11791,BOOK X.,And his buff jacket double-lac'd.
11792,BOOK X.,"Now you have heard my mournful ditty,"
11793,BOOK X.,I hope you'll spare a little pity;
11794,BOOK X.,Keep me in limbo till you try
11795,BOOK X.,If I don't scorn to tell a lie.
11796,BOOK X.,When bully Diomede replies:
11797,BOOK X.,May Hector knock out both my eyes
11798,BOOK X.,If I've a grain of pity now
11799,BOOK X.,For such a sneaking rogue as you!
11800,BOOK X.,Should you escape us both to-night
11801,BOOK X.,"Such rogues as you will never fight,"
11802,BOOK X.,"But sure as eggs, whilst folks are sleeping,"
11803,BOOK X.,We both again should catch thee peeping.
11804,BOOK X.,
11805,BOOK X.,"The moment that these words he said,"
11806,BOOK X.,"He from his shoulders whipp'd his head,"
11807,BOOK X.,"Which at that time for grace was seeking,"
11808,BOOK X.,"So as it fell continued speaking,"
11809,BOOK X.,"And even on the ground lay mutt'ring,"
11810,BOOK X.,And for a minute good kept sputt'ring;
11811,BOOK X.,"But chang'd its tone, and with an oath"
11812,BOOK X.,Bid the great devil fetch them both.
11813,BOOK X.,
11814,BOOK X.,Quickly these champions made a snap
11815,BOOK X.,At both the grey wolf's skin and cap:
11816,BOOK X.,"Whilst Diom. seiz'd his bow and stick,"
11817,BOOK X.,"Ulysses did his pocket pick,"
11818,BOOK X.,"In which he found a silver penny,"
11819,BOOK X.,"But, 'stead of owning he found any,"
11820,BOOK X.,He set his roguish plotting head
11821,BOOK X.,"To work, to cheat poor Diomede."
11822,BOOK X.,
11823,BOOK X.,"Tydides, says this face of gallows,"
11824,BOOK X.,"One day as I held chat with Pallas,"
11825,BOOK X.,"She told me, maugre all her care"
11826,BOOK X.,"Her goat-skin coat was worn threadbare,"
11827,BOOK X.,She therefore would be much my debtor
11828,BOOK X.,If I another coat could get her.
11829,BOOK X.,"As for her part, she does not care"
11830,BOOK X.,"Whether I get it in Rag-Fair,"
11831,BOOK X.,"Or Monmouth-Street, or any where,"
11832,BOOK X.,"So it comes cheap, for times are now"
11833,BOOK X.,"As hard above stairs, as below;"
11834,BOOK X.,Not one of all the royal pages
11835,BOOK X.,"But wants six quarters of his wages,"
11836,BOOK X.,"Occasion'd by a thriving band,"
11837,BOOK X.,That keep the money in their hand.
11838,BOOK X.,"Now, since the goddess is hard set"
11839,BOOK X.,"A coat of any kind to get,"
11840,BOOK X.,What better can she have than these?
11841,BOOK X.,"Which we'll present her, if you please."
11842,BOOK X.,
11843,BOOK X.,"Then, without waiting a reply,"
11844,BOOK X.,"He pray'd, and upward cock'd his eye:"
11845,BOOK X.,"Broughtonian queen! receive these goods,"
11846,BOOK X.,"And do not leave us in the suds,"
11847,BOOK X.,"But help us now to mind our hits,"
11848,BOOK X.,"And boldly steal these Thracian tits,"
11849,BOOK X.,Nor suffer any Trojan scrub
11850,BOOK X.,Thy true and trusty 'squires to drub.
11851,BOOK X.,If they should come before we've done
11852,BOOK X.,"The bus'ness we are now upon,"
11853,BOOK X.,"Do you but keep the whelps in play,"
11854,BOOK X.,And we'll take care to run away.
11855,BOOK X.,'Twill only be a grateful deed
11856,BOOK X.,"To help us in this time of need,"
11857,BOOK X.,Because of all the sky-bred crew

11859,BOOK X.,
11860,BOOK X.,"With sapient face, so saying, he"
11861,BOOK X.,"Hung the wolf's hide upon a tree,"
11862,BOOK X.,Though not so high but he could reach it--
11863,BOOK X.,"Pallas, he knew, would never fetch it;"
11864,BOOK X.,"Then scatter'd reeds along the track,"
11865,BOOK X.,To help to guide their rogueships back.
11866,BOOK X.,
11867,BOOK X.,"Now o'er the field they skulk away,"
11868,BOOK X.,Like bailiffs hunting for their prey:
11869,BOOK X.,"They found the Thracians in a trench,"
11870,BOOK X.,Snoring like judges on the bench;
11871,BOOK X.,"A broomstaff lay at each man's side,"
11872,BOOK X.,And to their carts their nags were tied.
11873,BOOK X.,The luckless Rhesus soon they spy
11874,BOOK X.,Amongst his raggamuffins lie;
11875,BOOK X.,"His two brave geldings, fit to start"
11876,BOOK X.,"For thousands, stood behind his cart."
11877,BOOK X.,"Ulysses, ever quick of sight,"
11878,BOOK X.,Was first to see th' unlucky wight;
11879,BOOK X.,"Then, pointing to his comrogue, cries,"
11880,BOOK X.,"See there, my boy, a tempting prize!"
11881,BOOK X.,"Rhesus, the cart and horses too,"
11882,BOOK X.,Are planted fair within your view:
11883,BOOK X.,"Besides the jerkin lac'd with gold,"
11884,BOOK X.,"Of which we were by Dolon told,"
11885,BOOK X.,"I'm pretty sure, before we part,"
11886,BOOK X.,That one of us may steal the cart:
11887,BOOK X.,"If you don't feel your courage lags,"
11888,BOOK X.,"Kill you the loons, I'll steal the nags."
11889,BOOK X.,
11890,BOOK X.,"He said; and Pallas, never slack"
11891,BOOK X.,"At mischief, clapp'd the whelp o' th' back;"
11892,BOOK X.,"On which the rascal fell to kicking,"
11893,BOOK X.,"Slashing, and cutting throats, and sticking,"
11894,BOOK X.,"With a long Dutchman's knife, that he"
11895,BOOK X.,Had bought to play at snickersnee:
11896,BOOK X.,"Where'er the varlet walk'd or stood,"
11897,BOOK X.,He made the ground all wet with blood.
11898,BOOK X.,"Just so the cat that guards the house,"
11899,BOOK X.,"Leaps from the dresser on a mouse,"
11900,BOOK X.,"Pots, pans, and kettles, all give way,"
11901,BOOK X.,Till puss has seiz'd the trembling prey;
11902,BOOK X.,"Just so this dog pursu'd his luck,"
11903,BOOK X.,Till he'd a dozen Thracians stuck.
11904,BOOK X.,"Ulysses, as his friend did stick 'em,"
11905,BOOK X.,"Behind a cock of hay did kick 'em,"
11906,BOOK X.,"For fear, he said, the horses might"
11907,BOOK X.,At dead men's bodies take a fright;
11908,BOOK X.,"But the true reason was, the elf"
11909,BOOK X.,Could pick their pockets by himself
11910,BOOK X.,"And that he did; but, by the by,"
11911,BOOK X.,'Tis only known to you and I.
11912,BOOK X.,"Now, having murder'd twelve, at last"
11913,BOOK X.,They found poor Rhesus snoring fast;
11914,BOOK X.,"Pallas had sent an ugly dream,"
11915,BOOK X.,Wherein a Dutch-built thief did seem
11916,BOOK X.,"To shake a snickersneeing knife,"
11917,BOOK X.,And swear he'd have his purse and life:
11918,BOOK X.,"All this he dream'd, old Homer knew,"
11919,BOOK X.,But never wak'd to find it true.
11920,BOOK X.,
11921,BOOK X.,"Ulysses quickly seiz'd the bits,"
11922,BOOK X.,And bridled both the flaming tits;
11923,BOOK X.,"Leading them out, to make 'em go"
11924,BOOK X.,He smack'd their buttocks with his bow:
11925,BOOK X.,"Though the whip hung where he might reach it,"
11926,BOOK X.,"He durst as well be hang'd as fetch it,"
11927,BOOK X.,But tipp'd the sign to Diomede
11928,BOOK X.,To come away with all his speed.
11929,BOOK X.,
11930,BOOK X.,"Now he was standing to consider,"
11931,BOOK X.,"And think about the matter, whether"
11932,BOOK X.,"To stick more men, which he could do,"
11933,BOOK X.,Or steal the cart and jacket too.
11934,BOOK X.,"Pallas, who saw him thus dispute"
11935,BOOK X.,"Within himself, in haste roars out,"
11936,BOOK X.,Pray what the pox are you about?
11937,BOOK X.,"Enough in conscience have you done,"
11938,BOOK X.,And split me but 'tis time to run!
11939,BOOK X.,In jobs like these the man that lingers
11940,BOOK X.,Is sure at last to burn his fingers.
11941,BOOK X.,
11942,BOOK X.,When Diom. heard Minerva say
11943,BOOK X.,"That she would have him run away,"
11944,BOOK X.,"He knew she scorn'd her friends to banter,"
11945,BOOK X.,"So mounts, and pops into a canter;"
11946,BOOK X.,For wise men oft exert their might in
11947,BOOK X.,Running away as well as fighting.
11948,BOOK X.,Ulysses with his bow-string flogging
11949,BOOK X.,Took care to keep these cart-tits jogging.
11950,BOOK X.,
11951,BOOK X.,"Apollo, who was Hector's friend,"
11952,BOOK X.,"Had seen this jade from heav'n descend,"
11953,BOOK X.,And guess'd it was for no good end;
11954,BOOK X.,"He saw the bitch, by mischief led,"
11955,BOOK X.,"Help this damn'd rogue, this Diomede,"
11956,BOOK X.,To murder honest folks in bed;
11957,BOOK X.,"Which vex'd him so, he whipp'd him down,"
11958,BOOK X.,"And wak'd the trusty Hippocoon,"
11959,BOOK X.,"Who came on Rhesus to attend,"
11960,BOOK X.,And was his coz. as well as friend.
11961,BOOK X.,The moment that this loving cousin
11962,BOOK X.,"Awak'd, he saw a baker's dozen"
11963,BOOK X.,"Of Thracians kill'd, and, what much worse is,"
11964,BOOK X.,The rogues had carried off the horses.
11965,BOOK X.,"At this poor Hip. began to cry,"
11966,BOOK X.,And wring his hands most bitterly;
11967,BOOK X.,"For all he sobb'd, but Rhesus long"
11968,BOOK X.,Remain'd the burden of his song:
11969,BOOK X.,"Had the damn'd dogs that came to fleece us,"
11970,BOOK X.,"Says he, but spar'd my cousin Rhesus,"
11971,BOOK X.,I'd not have lent 'em twenty curses
11972,BOOK X.,For stealing half a hundred horses;
11973,BOOK X.,"But since they have my cousin struck,"
11974,BOOK X.,May all their schemes have damn'd bad luck!
11975,BOOK X.,"And to spin out their life in pain,"
11976,BOOK X.,Pray G-d they ne'er may sh-te again!
11977,BOOK X.,
11978,BOOK X.,"Whilst Hippy mumbles out this prayer,"
11979,BOOK X.,"The Trojans flock about and stare,"
11980,BOOK X.,Wond'ring what rascals had been there.
11981,BOOK X.,"In the mean while these Yorkshire dealers,"
11982,BOOK X.,"By London juries call'd horse-stealers,"
11983,BOOK X.,"Kept flogging both their tits away,"
11984,BOOK X.,To reach the place where Dolon lay:
11985,BOOK X.,"Ulysses stopp'd, and begg'd Tydide"
11986,BOOK X.,"Would 'light, and fetch the grey wolf's hide,"
11987,BOOK X.,"With arrows, bow, and staff, and all"
11988,BOOK X.,They had from long egg'd Dolon stole.
11989,BOOK X.,"This done, their nags away they spang,"
11990,BOOK X.,Like thieves pursu'd by Fielding's gang.
11991,BOOK X.,"Old Nestor was in woeful doubt,"
11992,BOOK X.,And therefore kept a sharp look-out;
11993,BOOK X.,"So, when the thieving rogues drew near 'em,"
11994,BOOK X.,No wonder he was first to hear 'em:
11995,BOOK X.,"And hear 'em Square-toes did for sure,"
11996,BOOK X.,For thus th' old buff began to roar:
11997,BOOK X.,
11998,BOOK X.,"Lay but your ears upon the ground,"
11999,BOOK X.,"And, if you do not hear the sound"
12000,BOOK X.,"Of horses galloping this road,"
12001,BOOK X.,Call me a stupid queer old toad!
12002,BOOK X.,"Some geldings they perhaps have stole,"
12003,BOOK X.,(I wish they may with all my soul!)
12004,BOOK X.,And now perhaps are rattling come
12005,BOOK X.,In triumph with their booty home;
12006,BOOK X.,Though 'faith I can't help looking blue;
12007,BOOK X.,Pray Jove my fears don't prove too true!
12008,BOOK X.,"But I'm afraid they may be watch'd,"
12009,BOOK X.,And by that means be overmatch'd;
12010,BOOK X.,"And then my fine-laid scheme's abolish'd,"
12011,BOOK X.,And both their knotty pates demolish'd.
12012,BOOK X.,
12013,BOOK X.,"These words old buff had hardly said,"
12014,BOOK X.,But up the varlet Diomede
12015,BOOK X.,"Came puffing, like the trainband guard"
12016,BOOK X.,After a march of fifty yards;
12017,BOOK X.,Ulysses follow'd; off they jump
12018,BOOK X.,"Upon the ground with such a bump,"
12019,BOOK X.,They made it rattle with the thump.
12020,BOOK X.,"Their comrogues shook them by the hand,"
12021,BOOK X.,"With, Well, and how do matters stand?"
12022,BOOK X.,"We funk'd a little, 'faith and troth,"
12023,BOOK X.,"Lest we should lose you one or both,"
12024,BOOK X.,"And 'gan to look confounded blue,"
12025,BOOK X.,"Both for ourselves, as well as you."
12026,BOOK X.,
12027,BOOK X.,"But silence call'd, the queer old Greek,"
12028,BOOK X.,"Who always claim'd first turn to speak,"
12029,BOOK X.,"Began this speech: Ye sons of thunder,"
12030,BOOK X.,"Pray tell us, in the name of wonder,"
12031,BOOK X.,"Where you purloin'd these nags, which I"
12032,BOOK X.,Suspect ar'n't come at honestly?
12033,BOOK X.,"As sure as Helen is a punk,"
12034,BOOK X.,"You've found some whoring god dead-drunk,"
12035,BOOK X.,"Or fast asleep, so stole these nags,"
12036,BOOK X.,Which beat Apollo's all to rags.
12037,BOOK X.,I'll take upon my oath to swear
12038,BOOK X.,"He never yet had such a pair,"
12039,BOOK X.,"Though he's obliged, or lose his pay,"
12040,BOOK X.,To run his hackneys ev'ry day;
12041,BOOK X.,"And therefore, in discretion, ought"
12042,BOOK X.,To have the best that can be bought.
12043,BOOK X.,"Though I am old, yet, strike me stiff,"
12044,BOOK X.,"And dry me for a mummy, if"
12045,BOOK X.,In all the lands I've travell'd o'er
12046,BOOK X.,I ever saw such nags before!
12047,BOOK X.,"But speak the truth, if on the road"
12048,BOOK X.,"You did not fudge 'em from some god,"
12049,BOOK X.,"As we all know, when once you're set"
12050,BOOK X.,"On thieving, nothing 'scapes your net,"
12051,BOOK X.,"And Jove himself, and Pallas too,"
12052,BOOK X.,Have help'd your roguish tricks ere now.
12053,BOOK X.,
12054,BOOK X.,When Ithacus begins to chatter:
12055,BOOK X.,"Old dad, says he, 'tis no such matter."
12056,BOOK X.,"God gives us grace, and that of course is"
12057,BOOK X.,Much better for our souls than horses:
12058,BOOK X.,But these grey nags were born in Thrace;
12059,BOOK X.,"Their master to a better place,"
12060,BOOK X.,"Or worse, is gone, I can't say whether:"
12061,BOOK X.,But bold Tydides sent him thither:
12062,BOOK X.,And with him a round dozen went
12063,BOOK X.,"Of scrubs, that for his guard were meant;"
12064,BOOK X.,"And they have prov'd so very civil,"
12065,BOOK X.,As guard their master to the devil.
12066,BOOK X.,"But at our lucky setting out,"
12067,BOOK X.,"I should have told, we seiz'd a scout,"
12068,BOOK X.,"So judg'd it would be for the best,"
12069,BOOK X.,"To hell to send this prying guest,"
12070,BOOK X.,"To 'speak warm places for the rest,"
12071,BOOK X.,"Which we design'd should quickly follow,"
12072,BOOK X.,Unless prevented by Apollo.
12073,BOOK X.,"So Diomede the scoundrel led off,"
12074,BOOK X.,And in a moment whipp'd his head off.
12075,BOOK X.,
12076,BOOK X.,"This said, he took him up a switch,"
12077,BOOK X.,And spank'd the horses o'er the ditch.
12078,BOOK X.,"The rabble follow'd all the way,"
12079,BOOK X.,Roaring Huzza! huzza! huzza!
12080,BOOK X.,And ne'er could get their wide mouths shut
12081,BOOK X.,Until they reach'd the gen'ral's hut.
12082,BOOK X.,"There his old tits, not worth a guinea,"
12083,BOOK X.,Welcom'd the strangers with a whinney;
12084,BOOK X.,"Then, for a handsome sort of treat,"
12085,BOOK X.,"As oats were scarce, they gave 'em wheat."
12086,BOOK X.,
12087,BOOK X.,"This done, Ulysses takes a trip"
12088,BOOK X.,"With Dolon's hide on board a ship,"
12089,BOOK X.,"Where on the stern-post did he stretch it,"
12090,BOOK X.,Then bade Minerva come and fetch it.
12091,BOOK X.,"By this rogue's trick, 'tis pretty clear,"
12092,BOOK X.,He cheated Diom. of his share.
12093,BOOK X.,
12094,BOOK X.,"Now in the sea, to keep 'em sweet,"
12095,BOOK X.,"They wash'd their dirty, sweaty feet,"
12096,BOOK X.,"And, to refresh them from their toil,"
12097,BOOK X.,Their noses rubb'd with salad-oil;
12098,BOOK X.,"And then, to give their stomachs ease,"
12099,BOOK X.,Each cut a slice of bread and cheese:
12100,BOOK X.,"But, as on Pallas first they think,"
12101,BOOK X.,"To her they fill th' first mug of drink,"
12102,BOOK X.,"Which gently on the ground they pour,"
12103,BOOK X.,And bid her lick it off the floor.
12104,BOOK X.,"But how she did, to me's a doubt"
12105,BOOK X.,Which I could never yet make out.
12106,BOOK X.,And now these jovial lucky fellows
12107,BOOK X.,"Chaunted Old Rose, and burn the Bellows;"
12108,BOOK X.,"Having great reason to believe,"
12109,BOOK X.,"The next time they went out to thieve,"
12110,BOOK X.,"This scratching brim, without dispute,"
12111,BOOK X.,"Would stand their friend, and help 'em out."
12112,BOOK X.,"Joyful they dance, and sing, and roar,"
12113,BOOK X.,Till they can sing and dance no more;
12114,BOOK X.,"Then smoke their pipes, and drink, and funk,"
12115,BOOK X.,Till every soul got bloody drunk!

12254,BOOK XI.,To put his fighting doublet on.
12255,BOOK XI.,"His legs he thought there were some doubts on,"
12256,BOOK XI.,"So whipp'd a pair of large jack-boots on,"
12257,BOOK XI.,"Borrow'd that morning by his surgeon,"
12258,BOOK XI.,Of Foote's bold-hearted Major Sturgeon;
12259,BOOK XI.,"Then went and fetch'd his basket-hilt,"
12260,BOOK XI.,"And o'er his bosom hung a quilt,"
12261,BOOK XI.,"A lousy quilt, although the thing"
12262,BOOK XI.,Was giv'n him by a brother-king;
12263,BOOK XI.,"Though from a king, says Doctor Swift,"
12264,BOOK XI.,A man may get a lousy gift;
12265,BOOK XI.,"But being stuff'd with rags and flocks,"
12266,BOOK XI.,It kept his stomach free from knocks.
12267,BOOK XI.,On it was painted such a dragon
12268,BOOK XI.,As few sign-painters e'er could brag on;
12269,BOOK XI.,St. George's dragon on the sign
12270,BOOK XI.,"At Stamford, where they sell good wine,"
12271,BOOK XI.,"Would, I am sure, compar'd to that,"
12272,BOOK XI.,Appear a common tabby cat.
12273,BOOK XI.,"O'er all he tied a belt of buff-skin,"
12274,BOOK XI.,"Or doe, or tup, or some such tough skin,"
12275,BOOK XI.,Such as our northern carriers fold
12276,BOOK XI.,About their loins to keep out cold.
12277,BOOK XI.,"A potlid hung upon his arm,"
12278,BOOK XI.,To guard his ribs from taking harm.
12279,BOOK XI.,
12280,BOOK XI.,"[Illustration: Book XI, page 287."
12281,BOOK XI.,"And all around, in various places,"
12282,BOOK XI.,Were grinning chaps and wry-mouth'd faces;
12283,BOOK XI.,"But in the middle part, to make"
12284,BOOK XI.,"The Trojans run, he plac'd a snake.]"
12285,BOOK XI.,
12286,BOOK XI.,"With brazen hoops and brazen centre,"
12287,BOOK XI.,That points of broomsticks might not enter;
12288,BOOK XI.,"On which a frightful head did grin,"
12289,BOOK XI.,"Almost as ugly as Miss ----,"
12290,BOOK XI.,"And all around, in various places,"
12291,BOOK XI.,Were grinning chaps and wry-mouth'd faces;
12292,BOOK XI.,"But in the middle part, to make"
12293,BOOK XI.,"The Trojans run, he plac'd a snake"
12294,BOOK XI.,Gaping as wide as if he'd swallow
12295,BOOK XI.,"An ox, with horns, and guts, and tallow;"
12296,BOOK XI.,"Which made the folks, when he did meet 'em,"
12297,BOOK XI.,"Scamper for fear the snake should eat 'em,"
12298,BOOK XI.,"Whilst he pursu'd, and thought they fled"
12299,BOOK XI.,For fear of his great chuckle head.
12300,BOOK XI.,"His leathern skull-cap, worn thread-bare,"
12301,BOOK XI.,He furbish'd up with horse's hair;
12302,BOOK XI.,"Then in his hand two broomstaves shook,"
12303,BOOK XI.,And look'd as fierce as he could look.
12304,BOOK XI.,"Thus arm'd complete, he march'd to fright 'em,"
12305,BOOK XI.,In hopes to make 'em all be---te 'em.
12306,BOOK XI.,"That instant, to increase the strife,"
12307,BOOK XI.,Jove's daughter and his scolding wife
12308,BOOK XI.,A cannon-ball began to roll
12309,BOOK XI.,In Jupiter's great mustard-bowl.
12310,BOOK XI.,"Whilst the machine they both were holding,"
12311,BOOK XI.,To mend the noise they fell to scolding;
12312,BOOK XI.,"This cleft the welkin quite asunder,"
12313,BOOK XI.,"And made the Greeks believe 'twas thunder,"
12314,BOOK XI.,"Which fill'd 'em with such fighting rage,"
12315,BOOK XI.,They push'd like Britons to engage.
12316,BOOK XI.,"The foot first hasten'd to the battle,"
12317,BOOK XI.,And after them the carts did rattle;
12318,BOOK XI.,"With such a roaring they begun,"
12319,BOOK XI.,"Before his time they wak'd the Sun,"
12320,BOOK XI.,"Who, hearing such a dreadful clatter,"
12321,BOOK XI.,"Jump'd up and cried, Zoons! what's the matter?"
12322,BOOK XI.,"But both his eyes being clos'd with gum,"
12323,BOOK XI.,From whence this roaring noise did come
12324,BOOK XI.,"He could not spy, till fasting spittle"
12325,BOOK XI.,Had op'd his gummy eyes a little.
12326,BOOK XI.,"Jove thunder'd too, for he was mad"
12327,BOOK XI.,To see the dogs so bitter bad;
12328,BOOK XI.,"And mix'd a shower of rain with rud,"
12329,BOOK XI.,To make 'em think it rain'd sheer blood;
12330,BOOK XI.,"Nor would he longer tarry near 'em,"
12331,BOOK XI.,But fairly left Old Nick to steer 'em.
12332,BOOK XI.,
12333,BOOK XI.,"Near Ilus' grave, upon the hill,"
12334,BOOK XI.,Was Hector drinking bumpers still;
12335,BOOK XI.,"The grave-stone serv'd 'em for a table,"
12336,BOOK XI.,And there they drank till they weren't able
12337,BOOK XI.,"To stand, or, as our bard supposes,"
12338,BOOK XI.,To see each other's copper noses.
12339,BOOK XI.,"Polydamas partook the feast,"
12340,BOOK XI.,"With a sly Presbyterian priest,"
12341,BOOK XI.,Æneas call'd--a rogue whose lights
12342,BOOK XI.,"Would show you nothing but the whites,"
12343,BOOK XI.,"Whene'er he wanted to deceive you,"
12344,BOOK XI.,And helpless in the suds to leave you;
12345,BOOK XI.,"This he'd perform with such a grace,"
12346,BOOK XI.,You'd ne'er suspect his pious face.
12347,BOOK XI.,"Agenor, with his second-sight,"
12348,BOOK XI.,"And Polybus, a simple knight,"
12349,BOOK XI.,"Two brothers of Antenor's race,"
12350,BOOK XI.,Around the bottle took their place:
12351,BOOK XI.,"With Acamas, a boy that had"
12352,BOOK XI.,As few bad tricks as any lad
12353,BOOK XI.,"In all the town, although 'tis true"
12354,BOOK XI.,He was a Presbyterian Jew.--
12355,BOOK XI.,Pray what religion's that? say you.
12356,BOOK XI.,"I'll tell you, my good friend, anon:"
12357,BOOK XI.,A Presbyterian Jew is one
12358,BOOK XI.,"That likes engagements with the wenches,"
12359,BOOK XI.,But hates both gunpowder and trenches.
12360,BOOK XI.,Hector a pretty girl was thrumming
12361,BOOK XI.,"When first he heard the Grecians coming,"
12362,BOOK XI.,"And though twelve bumpers he had sipp'd up,"
12363,BOOK XI.,"He soon his shield and broomstick whipp'd up,"
12364,BOOK XI.,Then quickly 'mongst the Trojans goes out
12365,BOOK XI.,"To make 'em turn their sweaty toes out,"
12366,BOOK XI.,And square their elbows: here and there
12367,BOOK XI.,"He frisk'd about, and ev'ry where,"
12368,BOOK XI.,"Whilst streaming sparkles, as he pass'd,"
12369,BOOK XI.,From his broad metal buttons flash'd.
12370,BOOK XI.,On Sundays view our Farmer Gooding
12371,BOOK XI.,"When he attacks a suet-pudding,"
12372,BOOK XI.,"Slice after slice you'll see him cut,"
12373,BOOK XI.,And stuff within his gundy gut;
12374,BOOK XI.,Whilst on the other side his man
12375,BOOK XI.,Slices as fast as e'er he can;
12376,BOOK XI.,"With eager haste they slice and eat,"
12377,BOOK XI.,Till both their knives i' th' centre meet:
12378,BOOK XI.,Thus Greeks and Trojans on a sudden
12379,BOOK XI.,"Tumble like slices of the pudding,"
12380,BOOK XI.,"Give and receive most hearty thwacks,"
12381,BOOK XI.,"Yet never think to turn their backs,"
12382,BOOK XI.,"But scratch, and bite, and tear, and kick,"
12383,BOOK XI.,Like two boar-cats hung 'cross a stick.
12384,BOOK XI.,
12385,BOOK XI.,"Discord, the wrangling lawyer's friend,"
12386,BOOK XI.,Did on this dreadful broil attend;
12387,BOOK XI.,"But all the rest above the moon,"
12388,BOOK XI.,"Though they were willing, durst as soon"
12389,BOOK XI.,Run to Old Nick as venture down:
12390,BOOK XI.,"But though confin'd to keep their places,"
12391,BOOK XI.,"They made abominable faces,"
12392,BOOK XI.,Whilst all the time their guts were grumbling
12393,BOOK XI.,"At Jove, for keeping Troy from tumbling."
12394,BOOK XI.,"Now he, good soul, was set alone"
12395,BOOK XI.,"On his old cricket, call'd a throne,"
12396,BOOK XI.,"Where, spite of all his wife could say,"
12397,BOOK XI.,He gave Miss Destiny her way;
12398,BOOK XI.,Though now and then he squinted down
12399,BOOK XI.,"In great amaze, to see how soon"
12400,BOOK XI.,The varlets crack'd each others crown.
12401,BOOK XI.,
12402,BOOK XI.,"Now, whilst the Sun was working still"
12403,BOOK XI.,"To flog his hackneys up the hill,"
12404,BOOK XI.,"Both parties fought with equal luck,"
12405,BOOK XI.,And furious blows on each side struck:
12406,BOOK XI.,"But at the time when sea-coal heavers,"
12407,BOOK XI.,"With taylors' prentices and weavers,"
12408,BOOK XI.,"Quit looms and boards, and leave their work"
12409,BOOK XI.,In search of scalded peas and pork--
12410,BOOK XI.,Just at that time the Greeks begun
12411,BOOK XI.,To make some straggling Trojans run.
12412,BOOK XI.,"Atrides seiz'd that crisis too,"
12413,BOOK XI.,To let 'em see what he could do.
12414,BOOK XI.,"Quickly he crack'd Bianor's crown,"
12415,BOOK XI.,"A smart attorney of the town,"
12416,BOOK XI.,"Then knock'd his clerk Oileus down,"
12417,BOOK XI.,"Who, when he saw his loving master"
12418,BOOK XI.,"Get hurt, was coming with a plaster."
12419,BOOK XI.,"Atrides, whilst his hands were full,"
12420,BOOK XI.,"Like a brave fellow, crack'd his skull;"
12421,BOOK XI.,"Then of their jackets he bereft 'em,"
12422,BOOK XI.,And naked to the weather left 'em;
12423,BOOK XI.,"For which, depend, these sons of faction"
12424,BOOK XI.,At proper time will bring an action.
12425,BOOK XI.,"Now, whilst his hand was in, he runs"
12426,BOOK XI.,And meets with two of Priam's sons:
12427,BOOK XI.,"One was a bastard, got upon"
12428,BOOK XI.,The daughter of his ploughman John:
12429,BOOK XI.,"But, as we are inform'd, the other"
12430,BOOK XI.,"Was got upon an honest mother,"
12431,BOOK XI.,Who would not let her maidenhead
12432,BOOK XI.,Be touch'd till Christian grace was said;
12433,BOOK XI.,"But when that's done, e'en touch and touch,"
12434,BOOK XI.,No honest man can do too much.
12435,BOOK XI.,"These loving brothers, loth to part,"
12436,BOOK XI.,"Had hir'd a Norfolk farmer's cart,"
12437,BOOK XI.,Where with great skill they did contrive
12438,BOOK XI.,"That one should fight, the other drive."
12439,BOOK XI.,In former days they us'd to keep
12440,BOOK XI.,On Sussex downs a flock of sheep.
12441,BOOK XI.,"Achilles, who, as you must note,"
12442,BOOK XI.,"Commanded once a smuggling-boat,"
12443,BOOK XI.,To steal some sheep one night had landed;
12444,BOOK XI.,"And being then but slender-handed,"
12445,BOOK XI.,"He went his thieving crew to call off,"
12446,BOOK XI.,And bid them bring the boys and all off;
12447,BOOK XI.,Then made his dad for their release
12448,BOOK XI.,Remit him three half-crowns a-piece--
12449,BOOK XI.,"Money ill war'd, since they so soon"
12450,BOOK XI.,Were knock'd by Agamemnon down!
12451,BOOK XI.,"On the pert bastard first he press'd,"
12452,BOOK XI.,"And lent him such a punch o' th' breast,"
12453,BOOK XI.,It made him in a twinkling kick up
12454,BOOK XI.,"His heels, and belch, and f--t, and hiccup;"
12455,BOOK XI.,Instant bestow'd he such a pat
12456,BOOK XI.,"Upon the brother's gold-lac'd hat,"
12457,BOOK XI.,"That down he tumbled with a plump,"
12458,BOOK XI.,"And bruis'd his thigh, and split his rump:"
12459,BOOK XI.,"Then, flat as on the ground they lay,"
12460,BOOK XI.,He stole their hats and coats away.
12461,BOOK XI.,"With aching hearts the Trojans spy him,"
12462,BOOK XI.,But dare not for their guts come nigh him;
12463,BOOK XI.,"Thus shoplifts see their brothers taken,"
12464,BOOK XI.,But dare not stir to save their bacon.
12465,BOOK XI.,"Still furious on the foe he runs,"
12466,BOOK XI.,And mauls Antimachus' two sons--
12467,BOOK XI.,"A sneaking rascal, who had sold"
12468,BOOK XI.,His vote in parliament for gold;
12469,BOOK XI.,"From whoring Paris taking pay,"
12470,BOOK XI.,"He made a speech for Nell to stay,"
12471,BOOK XI.,"And humbugg'd all the senate so,"
12472,BOOK XI.,"They bawl out Aye, instead of No."
12473,BOOK XI.,"Now these two lads Atrides caught,"
12474,BOOK XI.,And drubb'd 'em for the father's fault.
12475,BOOK XI.,"They got a hard-mouth'd resty horse,"
12476,BOOK XI.,"They could not stop with all their force,"
12477,BOOK XI.,"But he would run, aye, that he would,"
12478,BOOK XI.,Just where this lighting Grecian stood;
12479,BOOK XI.,The lads had pull'd the resty tup
12480,BOOK XI.,"Till both were tir'd, so gave it up;"
12481,BOOK XI.,"On which the Greek their noddles peppers,"
12482,BOOK XI.,"Till down they dropp'd upon their kneppers,"
12483,BOOK XI.,"And, in a dismal doleful ditty,"
12484,BOOK XI.,Begg'd for an ounce or two of pity:
12485,BOOK XI.,"Good Mr. Agamemnon, spare"
12486,BOOK XI.,"Two harmless lads, and hear their pray'r,"
12487,BOOK XI.,For which Antimachus will make
12488,BOOK XI.,Such presents you'll be glad to take.
12489,BOOK XI.,You need but send him a short note
12490,BOOK XI.,"You've stow'd us safe in your old boat,"
12491,BOOK XI.,And if he doth not think it proper
12492,BOOK XI.,"To send a stone of brass and copper,"
12493,BOOK XI.,"We then will give you leave to beat us,"
12494,BOOK XI.,"Or, if you please, to hash and eat us."
12495,BOOK XI.,
12496,BOOK XI.,"Now, though the younkers made no noise,"
12497,BOOK XI.,"But talk'd like very hopeful boys,"
12498,BOOK XI.,"This harden'd rogue, before they'd done,"
12499,BOOK XI.,In a great passion thus begun:
12500,BOOK XI.,"If you're Antimachus's blood,"
12501,BOOK XI.,"I'll drub your hides, by all that's good!"
12502,BOOK XI.,That scurvy mangey rascal would
12503,BOOK XI.,"Have kill'd my brother if he could,"
12504,BOOK XI.,"With sly Ulysses, when from Greece"
12505,BOOK XI.,"They came to fetch that precious piece,"
12506,BOOK XI.,"That Madam Helen, whose affair"
12507,BOOK XI.,Has cost more lives than she has hair
12508,BOOK XI.,"Upon her head, or any where."
12509,BOOK XI.,No prayers that you can coin shall speed
12510,BOOK XI.,"With me, to save such scoundrel breed."
12511,BOOK XI.,On this he with a crab-tree stump
12512,BOOK XI.,"Gave poor Philander such a thump,"
12513,BOOK XI.,"It made him tumble from the cart out,"
12514,BOOK XI.,And spew his very guts and heart out.
12515,BOOK XI.,"The brother finding him so tart,"
12516,BOOK XI.,He leap'd head foremost from the cart:
12517,BOOK XI.,"There, as he lay upon the sands,"
12518,BOOK XI.,The whelp disabled both his hands;
12519,BOOK XI.,"Then boldly seiz'd him by the snout,"
12520,BOOK XI.,And almost twined his neck about.
12521,BOOK XI.,"Whilst he continu'd these mad freaks,"
12522,BOOK XI.,He double-distanc'd all the Greeks:
12523,BOOK XI.,"Still he kept cuffing on, and swearing,"
12524,BOOK XI.,Whilst they kept wondering and staring.
12525,BOOK XI.,So when the mighty bowl doth sally
12526,BOOK XI.,"From th' corner of a nine-pin alley,"
12527,BOOK XI.,"Pin after pin by him is thrown,"
12528,BOOK XI.,Till the whole nine are tumbled down;
12529,BOOK XI.,Just so Atrides in his passion
12530,BOOK XI.,"Tumbled 'em down in nine-pin fashion,"
12531,BOOK XI.,"And drove about with such a rumble,"
12532,BOOK XI.,Whole squadrons either run or tumble;
12533,BOOK XI.,"Many a Trojan made he smart,"
12534,BOOK XI.,And emptied many a higler's cart.
12535,BOOK XI.,"The cart-tits, when without a guide,"
12536,BOOK XI.,"Ran like bewitch'd from side to side,"
12537,BOOK XI.,"Farted, and kick'd, and jump'd about--"
12538,BOOK XI.,"In short, they made such dreadful rout,"
12539,BOOK XI.,They hurt their Trojan friends much more
12540,BOOK XI.,Than they had done 'em good before.
12541,BOOK XI.,
12542,BOOK XI.,"Whilst the fierce Greek, where'er he flew,"
12543,BOOK XI.,"Beat the poor devils black and blue,"
12544,BOOK XI.,"Had Hector met this Grecian cock,"
12545,BOOK XI.,Depend upon't he'd got a knock;
12546,BOOK XI.,"But Jove took care he should not meet him,"
12547,BOOK XI.,"Lest in his passion he should eat him,"
12548,BOOK XI.,But kept the Trojan's coat from stains
12549,BOOK XI.,"Of blood, and guts, and scatter'd brains."
12550,BOOK XI.,"Now Jove took all this care, I ween,"
12551,BOOK XI.,"'Cause Hector's coat was very clean,"
12552,BOOK XI.,Whilst ev'ry Greek in all the clan
12553,BOOK XI.,Look'd like a butcher's journeyman.
12554,BOOK XI.,
12555,BOOK XI.,And now this furious fighting knave
12556,BOOK XI.,Drove 'em like smoke by Ilus' grave
12557,BOOK XI.,"Amongst some fig-trees, where for shelter"
12558,BOOK XI.,They ran like wild-fire helter-skelter--
12559,BOOK XI.,"Not with design to turn and rally,"
12560,BOOK XI.,But there they knew a dark blind alley
12561,BOOK XI.,"That led directly to the town,"
12562,BOOK XI.,Through which they ran like devils down.
12563,BOOK XI.,"Atrides ran as fast as they,"
12564,BOOK XI.,"Roaring and bawling all the way,"
12565,BOOK XI.,Till he had made himself as hot
12566,BOOK XI.,As Fore-street Doll's pease-porridge pot:
12567,BOOK XI.,"When, coming near the Scean gate,"
12568,BOOK XI.,He thought it would be best to wait
12569,BOOK XI.,"For further help; so held his stick up,"
12570,BOOK XI.,And stopp'd to take his wind and hiccup.
12571,BOOK XI.,
12572,BOOK XI.,In the mean time the Trojans ply
12573,BOOK XI.,Their clay-burnt heels most lustily.
12574,BOOK XI.,As when the constable and watchmen
12575,BOOK XI.,Are on a party sent to catch men
12576,BOOK XI.,Who have the day before been dealing
12577,BOOK XI.,In what the justices call stealing;
12578,BOOK XI.,"Their phiz the thieves no sooner spy,"
12579,BOOK XI.,But all to reach the window try;
12580,BOOK XI.,"Their haste occasions such a jumble,"
12581,BOOK XI.,"Head over heels the scoundrels tumble,"
12582,BOOK XI.,"And wedge themselves so very fast,"
12583,BOOK XI.,The hobbling watchmen seize the last;
12584,BOOK XI.,"So did Atrides bounce and fick,"
12585,BOOK XI.,And always lent the last a kick:
12586,BOOK XI.,"Thus did he play the de'il and all,"
12587,BOOK XI.,"Until he reach'd the Trojan wall,"
12588,BOOK XI.,Which his great fury did design
12589,BOOK XI.,To tumble down or undermine;
12590,BOOK XI.,When Jove sent such a shower of rain
12591,BOOK XI.,"As won't be quickly seen again,"
12592,BOOK XI.,"And would have added thunder to it,"
12593,BOOK XI.,But could not get his lightning through it.
12594,BOOK XI.,
12595,BOOK XI.,"At this he bawls, Come hither, Iris!"
12596,BOOK XI.,"You see in rain so drench'd my fire is,"
12597,BOOK XI.,"It cannot go as I design'd it,"
12598,BOOK XI.,To make yond' roaring scoundrels mind it;
12599,BOOK XI.,"And as for thunder, though they fear it,"
12600,BOOK XI.,They make such noise they cannot hear it.
12601,BOOK XI.,"Therefore, my girl, do you descend"
12602,BOOK XI.,"And tell my honest Trojan friend,"
12603,BOOK XI.,"Whilst Agamemnon thus keeps puffing,"
12604,BOOK XI.,I would not have him think of cuffing;
12605,BOOK XI.,"Let other people stop his flouncing,"
12606,BOOK XI.,Bold Hector need not mind his bouncing:
12607,BOOK XI.,Small captains may his waters watch;
12608,BOOK XI.,For Hector he's no more a match
12609,BOOK XI.,"Than penny bleeders to a surgeon,"
12610,BOOK XI.,Or Jerry Sneak to Major Sturgeon.
12611,BOOK XI.,"Tell him, although he makes such rout."
12612,BOOK XI.,"And kicks the Trojans all about,"
12613,BOOK XI.,"In half an hour, I'll lay a groat,"
12614,BOOK XI.,He gets his teeth knock'd down his throat;
12615,BOOK XI.,"Then shall my bully Hector thwack 'em,"
12616,BOOK XI.,"And I will lend a hand to whack 'em,"
12617,BOOK XI.,Till he has made them take long strides
12618,BOOK XI.,On board their boats to save their hides--
12619,BOOK XI.,"Drub 'em he shall from place to place,"
12620,BOOK XI.,Till Night pops up her blackguard face.
12621,BOOK XI.,
12622,BOOK XI.,"At this the jade gave such a jump,"
12623,BOOK XI.,That some foul air within her rump
12624,BOOK XI.,Came puffing with a thund'ring trump:
12625,BOOK XI.,"But letting fly too soon, we find"
12626,BOOK XI.,She drove so much unsav'ry wind
12627,BOOK XI.,"Up Jove's broad nose, he look'd d---d gruff,"
12628,BOOK XI.,And sneez'd as if he'd ta'en Scotch snuff.
12629,BOOK XI.,"These thund'ring puffs, let out so nigh"
12630,BOOK XI.,"The sun, take fire as down they fly;"
12631,BOOK XI.,"From whence 'tis evident that plain bow,"
12632,BOOK XI.,"Which silly mortals call the rain-bow,"
12633,BOOK XI.,Is known by folks that view it nigher
12634,BOOK XI.,To be a chain of farts on fire.
12635,BOOK XI.,
12636,BOOK XI.,"[Illustration: Book XI, page 306."
12637,BOOK XI.,"Hector, says she, perhaps you'll stare,"
12638,BOOK XI.,To hear I come from Jupiter;

12640,BOOK XI.,He sends his compliments to you.]
12641,BOOK XI.,
12642,BOOK XI.,"Hector she found amidst the fray,"
12643,BOOK XI.,Mounted upon a brewer's dray:
12644,BOOK XI.,"Hector, says she, perhaps you'll stare,"
12645,BOOK XI.,To hear I come from Jupiter;
12646,BOOK XI.,"But so it is, believe it true,"
12647,BOOK XI.,"He sends his compliments to you,"
12648,BOOK XI.,"And says, while Atreus' son keeps puffing,"
12649,BOOK XI.,He would not have you think of cuffing;
12650,BOOK XI.,"Let other people stop his flouncing,"
12651,BOOK XI.,You need not mind his brags and bouncing;
12652,BOOK XI.,Small captains may his waters watch;
12653,BOOK XI.,For you the whelp's no more a match
12654,BOOK XI.,"Than penny bleeders to a surgeon,"
12655,BOOK XI.,Or Jerry Sneak to Major Sturgeon:
12656,BOOK XI.,"And adds, that though he makes such rout,"
12657,BOOK XI.,"And kicks the Trojans all about,"
12658,BOOK XI.,"In half an hour, he'll lay a groat,"
12659,BOOK XI.,He gets his teeth knock'd down his throat.
12660,BOOK XI.,"Then Hector shall the Grecians whack,"
12661,BOOK XI.,"And I will clap him on the back,"
12662,BOOK XI.,Till he has made each Grecian fighter
12663,BOOK XI.,Scamper on board his rotten lighter:
12664,BOOK XI.,"Nor shall he cease the rogues to fright,"
12665,BOOK XI.,Till they're reliev'd by Mrs. Night.
12666,BOOK XI.,"Then, in a cloud as black as pitch,"
12667,BOOK XI.,She vanish'd like a Lapland witch.
12668,BOOK XI.,
12669,BOOK XI.,"Hector no sooner heard this speech,"
12670,BOOK XI.,"But up he started off his breech,"
12671,BOOK XI.,"Leap'd from the dray in haste, and then"
12672,BOOK XI.,Gave two-pence to the brewer's men
12673,BOOK XI.,"To get a pint of stale, or strong,"
12674,BOOK XI.,Because they let him ride so long;
12675,BOOK XI.,"Then, with a broomstick in each hand,"
12676,BOOK XI.,He bid the scamp'ring Trojans stand;
12677,BOOK XI.,"Tells them, if now they box, they may"
12678,BOOK XI.,"Run when they please another day,"
12679,BOOK XI.,And he'll run too as well as they.
12680,BOOK XI.,"When they heard this, the Trojans stout,"
12681,BOOK XI.,"With one consent all fac'd about,"
12682,BOOK XI.,And seem'd resolv'd to box it out:
12683,BOOK XI.,"The Greeks, who hop'd they'd all been gone,"
12684,BOOK XI.,"Stared when they found 'em coming on,"
12685,BOOK XI.,"Cock'd their wide jaws in great surprise,"
12686,BOOK XI.,And fain would disbelieve their eyes.
12687,BOOK XI.,"Both sides begin to fight it o'er,"
12688,BOOK XI.,As if they'd never fought before;
12689,BOOK XI.,"Whilst in his passion, Atreus' son"
12690,BOOK XI.,"Kept driving like a devil on,"
12691,BOOK XI.,And gave the Trojan sons of whores
12692,BOOK XI.,Black eyes and broken pates by scores.
12693,BOOK XI.,
12694,BOOK XI.,"Hopkins and Sternhold, lend me aid"
12695,BOOK XI.,To tell what work this whore's-bird made;
12696,BOOK XI.,"You, who king David's psalms were able"
12697,BOOK XI.,"To write in verse so lamentable,"
12698,BOOK XI.,As made the fornicating king
12699,BOOK XI.,"Cry, when you meant to make him sing;"
12700,BOOK XI.,"Where he repents, indeed, most ably"
12701,BOOK XI.,You made him do it lamentably!
12702,BOOK XI.,"Help me to some of your rare pickings,"
12703,BOOK XI.,"That I may sing Atrides' kickings,"
12704,BOOK XI.,That in re-mem-ber-ance I may
12705,BOOK XI.,Remain for ever and for aye:
12706,BOOK XI.,"Come on, bold boys, and make it known"
12707,BOOK XI.,"What shoals of scrubs he tumbled down,"
12708,BOOK XI.,And whether 'twas a peer or groom
12709,BOOK XI.,That tasted first his stick of broom.
12710,BOOK XI.,
12711,BOOK XI.,"Iphidamas it prov'd, a swain-o"
12712,BOOK XI.,"Got by Antenor on Theano,"
12713,BOOK XI.,Whose pasture being stock'd before
12714,BOOK XI.,"So hard that it would bear no more,"
12715,BOOK XI.,He thought it best to send the lad;
12716,BOOK XI.,"To Clifeus, the mother's dad,"
12717,BOOK XI.,Who farm'd on lease a little place
12718,BOOK XI.,"Upon a bleak hill-side in Thrace,"
12719,BOOK XI.,For which he paid the landlord clear
12720,BOOK XI.,"Three, or perhaps four, pounds a year."
12721,BOOK XI.,For twenty years the good old rock
12722,BOOK XI.,There fed him like a fighting-cock;
12723,BOOK XI.,And then to use him to the Strife
12724,BOOK XI.,"Man's born to bear, he for a wife"
12725,BOOK XI.,"Gave him his daughter: but the boy,"
12726,BOOK XI.,"Hearing of boxing-bouts at Troy,"
12727,BOOK XI.,"Was seiz'd with such desire to fight,"
12728,BOOK XI.,"He listed on his wedding-night,"
12729,BOOK XI.,"And left his wife, though thought a beauty,"
12730,BOOK XI.,Before he'd done an inch of duty;
12731,BOOK XI.,"By shipping to Percope went,"
12732,BOOK XI.,From thence by land to Troy was sent.
12733,BOOK XI.,Thinking the time was now or never
12734,BOOK XI.,"For him to show off something clever,"
12735,BOOK XI.,"From out the foremost ranks he jumps,"
12736,BOOK XI.,Resolv'd to fight this king of trumps.
12737,BOOK XI.,"Atrides, who full well did know"
12738,BOOK XI.,That in the first good hearty blow
12739,BOOK XI.,"Lay often more than half the battle,"
12740,BOOK XI.,Let fly his broomstick with a rattle:
12741,BOOK XI.,"The Trojan stoop'd, and whiz it went,"
12742,BOOK XI.,"But miss'd his nob, where it was meant."
12743,BOOK XI.,The youth then with great fury puts
12744,BOOK XI.,"His cudgel 'cross the Grecian's guts,"
12745,BOOK XI.,Which stroke he had severely felt
12746,BOOK XI.,"But for his greasy currier's belt,"
12747,BOOK XI.,"Though he so much of it did feel,"
12748,BOOK XI.,"'Spite of his belt, it made him reel;"
12749,BOOK XI.,"But when recover'd from the shock,"
12750,BOOK XI.,He lent him such a rare hard knock
12751,BOOK XI.,"Upon his crag, the luckless chap"
12752,BOOK XI.,Fell down and took an endless nap.
12753,BOOK XI.,"His wife, that such a fortune brought,"
12754,BOOK XI.,"Two cows, six sheep, and one ram goat,"
12755,BOOK XI.,"Thought hers a mighty grievous lot,"
12756,BOOK XI.,"When she a maidenhead had got,"
12757,BOOK XI.,"Neatly dish'd up as hands could make it,"
12758,BOOK XI.,Ready for him to come and take it;
12759,BOOK XI.,"But he, poor soul, was lying flat,"
12760,BOOK XI.,Whilst the Greek stole his coat and hat.
12761,BOOK XI.,
12762,BOOK XI.,"Coon his bro. was pretty near,"
12763,BOOK XI.,"And vex'd to th' heart, a man may swear;"
12764,BOOK XI.,"It fill'd his liver with such sadness,"
12765,BOOK XI.,He roar'd and cried for very madness:
12766,BOOK XI.,"But though he wept full sore, we find"
12767,BOOK XI.,He did not weep himself quite blind;
12768,BOOK XI.,"But when the Grecian did not 'spy him,"
12769,BOOK XI.,"He edg'd till he got pretty nigh him,"
12770,BOOK XI.,"Then at the bully aim'd a knock,"
12771,BOOK XI.,"Which gave his elbow such a shock,"
12772,BOOK XI.,"It made his metal buttons jingle,"
12773,BOOK XI.,And both his wrist and fingers tingle.
12774,BOOK XI.,"The Greek was stunn'd, though not with fear,"
12775,BOOK XI.,"But knew not, or to cry or swear;"
12776,BOOK XI.,"Then whilst poor Coon guards his brother,"
12777,BOOK XI.,"And covers this side, then the other,"
12778,BOOK XI.,"Damning the Grecian for a whelp,"
12779,BOOK XI.,"And roaring like a man for help,"
12780,BOOK XI.,The wary Greek upon his crown
12781,BOOK XI.,"'Spy'd a soft spot, so knock'd him down--"
12782,BOOK XI.,"Down with a bang he tumbled plump,"
12783,BOOK XI.,And lay across his brother's rump.
12784,BOOK XI.,
12785,BOOK XI.,"Atrides, now more furious grown,"
12786,BOOK XI.,"Drives like a madman up and down,"
12787,BOOK XI.,"Using all weapons clubs, or sticks,"
12788,BOOK XI.,"Old broken piss-pots, stones, and bricks--"
12789,BOOK XI.,"In this condition on he blunder'd,"
12790,BOOK XI.,And lam'd or frighten'd half a-hundred.
12791,BOOK XI.,"Whilst he perform'd these pranks, his arm"
12792,BOOK XI.,Continued tolerably warm;
12793,BOOK XI.,"But when the blood began to settle,"
12794,BOOK XI.,"And he was partly off his mettle,"
12795,BOOK XI.,The elbow stiffen'd with such pain
12796,BOOK XI.,As made the bully grin again;
12797,BOOK XI.,Knaves that are whipp'd for thieving cases
12798,BOOK XI.,Could never coin such ugly faces.
12799,BOOK XI.,"With mighty pain and anguish fretting,"
12800,BOOK XI.,A dung-cart he was forc'd to get in:
12801,BOOK XI.,"But lest the foe should think he had cause,"
12802,BOOK XI.,"He put a good face on a bad cause,"
12803,BOOK XI.,"And bawls, O Grecian raggamuffins!"
12804,BOOK XI.,Stick stoutly to your kicks and cuffings!
12805,BOOK XI.,"I'll get a dram to ease my pain,"
12806,BOOK XI.,And in a twink be back again;
12807,BOOK XI.,"Jove will no longer let me fight,"
12808,BOOK XI.,But slam me if 'tis aught but spite!
12809,BOOK XI.,
12810,BOOK XI.,"No sooner had he spoke, but smack"
12811,BOOK XI.,He heard the carter's whip go crack;
12812,BOOK XI.,"And crack it might, as these old hacks"
12813,BOOK XI.,For twice three steps requir'd six cracks;
12814,BOOK XI.,"Though, by great luck, this Jehu got"
12815,BOOK XI.,His geldings smack'd into a trot;
12816,BOOK XI.,"But as they both were touch'd i' th' wind,"
12817,BOOK XI.,"They puff'd out clouds of smoke behind,"
12818,BOOK XI.,Whilst from their sides a lather run
12819,BOOK XI.,Would almost fill a brewer's tun;
12820,BOOK XI.,"At last, when tir'd, and almost spent,"
12821,BOOK XI.,They brought him to his ragged tent.
12822,BOOK XI.,
12823,BOOK XI.,"Hector look'd sharp, and quickly saw"
12824,BOOK XI.,"This huffing, cuffing varlet go;"
12825,BOOK XI.,"Then to his Trojans and allies,"
12826,BOOK XI.,"To raise their mettle, thus he cries:"
12827,BOOK XI.,
12828,BOOK XI.,"Ye roaring blades, that scorn all fear,"
12829,BOOK XI.,"Ye Dardans, and ye Lycians, hear!"
12830,BOOK XI.,"Now is the time, boys, now or never,"
12831,BOOK XI.,Roar Wilkes and Liberty for ever!
12832,BOOK XI.,"Yon leader of the Scotch court-cards,"
12833,BOOK XI.,"Call'd the third regiment of guards,"
12834,BOOK XI.,Has got some mischief in the fray:
12835,BOOK XI.,I saw the rascal run away:
12836,BOOK XI.,"Besides, Dame Iris from above"
12837,BOOK XI.,Brought me some compliments from Jove:
12838,BOOK XI.,"Hector, says she, you must not shrink,"
12839,BOOK XI.,But pay the varlets till they stink;
12840,BOOK XI.,"Therefore you've nought to do but box,"
12841,BOOK XI.,I'll warm their jackets with a pox.
12842,BOOK XI.,
12843,BOOK XI.,"The valiant Hec. with such-like speeches,"
12844,BOOK XI.,Forth from the bottom of their breeches
12845,BOOK XI.,"Pluck'd up their hearts as fast as could be,"
12846,BOOK XI.,And fairly plac'd 'em where they should be:
12847,BOOK XI.,So the poor gard'ner cheers his dog
12848,BOOK XI.,"To seize and sowl his neighbour's hog,"
12849,BOOK XI.,Claps him o' th' back until he tears off
12850,BOOK XI.,"The ugly grunting pilf'rer's ears off,"
12851,BOOK XI.,"Boiling with rage, because the brute"
12852,BOOK XI.,Returns so oft to spoil his fruit:
12853,BOOK XI.,"Thus Hector bawls, nor that alone,"
12854,BOOK XI.,But is the first to lead 'em on:
12855,BOOK XI.,"On the deep file with might doth pour,"
12856,BOOK XI.,"Like a black heavy city-shower,"
12857,BOOK XI.,"Which clears the streets, and into shops"
12858,BOOK XI.,"Drives painted whores and brainless fops,"
12859,BOOK XI.,"With fury from the pantiles rolls,"
12860,BOOK XI.,"Drenches the signs and barbers' poles,"
12861,BOOK XI.,"Washes each dirty stinking street,"
12862,BOOK XI.,And for an hour the town is sweet.
12863,BOOK XI.,
12864,BOOK XI.,"O Churchill's Muse! for once assist,"
12865,BOOK XI.,Whilst humbly I draw out a list
12866,BOOK XI.,"Of those that fell by Hector's cudgel,"
12867,BOOK XI.,"When Jove, who now and then doth judge ill,"
12868,BOOK XI.,"Without regard to Whig or Tory,"
12869,BOOK XI.,Bestow'd on him a day of glory.
12870,BOOK XI.,To 'scape him there appear'd but small hopes--
12871,BOOK XI.,"He smash'd Assæus first, then Dolops;"
12872,BOOK XI.,"Assæus was a great book-binder,"
12873,BOOK XI.,And Dolops was a razor-grinder.
12874,BOOK XI.,"Just there the noted woollen-draper,"
12875,BOOK XI.,"Autonous, began to vapour,"
12876,BOOK XI.,But Hector quickly made him caper.
12877,BOOK XI.,He next began to grapple with
12878,BOOK XI.,"Opites, a great silver-smith;"
12879,BOOK XI.,On his bread-basket such a thump
12880,BOOK XI.,"He lent him, down he tumbled plump."
12881,BOOK XI.,Then flat as e'er you saw a flounder
12882,BOOK XI.,He quickly fell'd the great bell-founder
12883,BOOK XI.,"Hipponous--down he fell,"
12884,BOOK XI.,His noddle sounded like a bell.
12885,BOOK XI.,"Ophelthius next, a pastry-cook,"
12886,BOOK XI.,"That made good pigeon-pie of rook,"
12887,BOOK XI.,"Cut venison from Yorkshire hogs[1],"
12888,BOOK XI.,"And made rare mutton-pies of dogs,"
12889,BOOK XI.,From Hector's crab-tree stick of sticks
12890,BOOK XI.,Got a reward for all rogue's tricks
12891,BOOK XI.,"is hard-bak'd head was finely whack'd,"
12892,BOOK XI.,"The skin all bruis'd, and crust all crack'd."
12893,BOOK XI.,"Orus, who kept a noted inn"
12894,BOOK XI.,"Full on the road from York to Lynn,"
12895,BOOK XI.,"A chatt'ring whelp, just like an ape,"
12896,BOOK XI.,Got in a most confounded scrape;
12897,BOOK XI.,"As Hector rapp'd the saucy dog's head,"
12898,BOOK XI.,It sounded like an empty hogshead.
12899,BOOK XI.,"Esymmus, a ship-biscuit baker,"
12900,BOOK XI.,Got pelted by this noddle-breaker--
12901,BOOK XI.,"His skull, as Hector's stick did whisk it,"
12902,BOOK XI.,Rattled just like a hard ship-biscuit.
12903,BOOK XI.,"Last, the rope-maker, Agelau,"
12904,BOOK XI.,"By a great knock upon his jaw,"
12905,BOOK XI.,Was sent to see his friends below;
12906,BOOK XI.,"The Trojan's broomstick, unresisted,"
12907,BOOK XI.,His slender thread of life untwisted.
12908,BOOK XI.,
12909,BOOK XI.,"These, you must note, were no riff-raff,"
12910,BOOK XI.,But officers upon the staff:
12911,BOOK XI.,"As for your common country cousins,"
12912,BOOK XI.,"He knock'd them down by pecks and dozens,"
12913,BOOK XI.,"And, with a flourish of his stick,"
12914,BOOK XI.,Laid 'em all on their backs as quick
12915,BOOK XI.,"As gamblers thump their box and dice,"
12916,BOOK XI.,Or nitty taylors crack their lice.
12917,BOOK XI.,"Have you not seen a sort of twirlwind,"
12918,BOOK XI.,"Which country people call a whirlwind,"
12919,BOOK XI.,"Whip up a haycock from the ground,"
12920,BOOK XI.,"And twist it round, and round, and round,"
12921,BOOK XI.,"Whilst with their peepers fix'd in air,"
12922,BOOK XI.,"And gaping mouths, the bumkins stare?"
12923,BOOK XI.,"Thus Hector whipp'd about, and soon"
12924,BOOK XI.,"Kick'd up their heels, or knock'd 'em down."
12925,BOOK XI.,
12926,BOOK XI.,"And now had Greece been overturn'd,"
12927,BOOK XI.,And all their keels and scullers burn'd;
12928,BOOK XI.,But sly Ulysses ran with speed
12929,BOOK XI.,To call his neighbour Diomede:
12930,BOOK XI.,"Diom. says he, why, what the pox,"
12931,BOOK XI.,We'd better both be set i' th' stocks
12932,BOOK XI.,Than stand and stare whilst Hector keeps
12933,BOOK XI.,Smoking the Grecians upon heaps.
12934,BOOK XI.,Let's meet this fav'rite of the gods:
12935,BOOK XI.,"Were two to one, and that's brave odds."
12936,BOOK XI.,
12937,BOOK XI.,"Says Diomede, You know, Ulysses,"
12938,BOOK XI.,I'll fight with any man: but this is
12939,BOOK XI.,Another case; I've suffer'd evils
12940,BOOK XI.,For boxing both with gods and devils;
12941,BOOK XI.,"Jove helps this Hector from above,"
12942,BOOK XI.,And souse me if I'll box with Jove!
12943,BOOK XI.,"What boots it now, my friend, to stand,"
12944,BOOK XI.,If Jove won't lend a helping hand?
12945,BOOK XI.,"'Tis striving without spades to dig,"
12946,BOOK XI.,And whistling to a stone-dead pig.
12947,BOOK XI.,"Then as he spoke he gave a sigh,"
12948,BOOK XI.,And whiz he let his broomstick fly;
12949,BOOK XI.,"It hit a purse-proud fellow's crown,"
12950,BOOK XI.,"A Wapping lawyer of renown,"
12951,BOOK XI.,"Thymbræus call'd, and fetch'd him down."
12952,BOOK XI.,"Ulysses then, that cunning tartar,"
12953,BOOK XI.,"Up with his club, and fell'd the carter."
12954,BOOK XI.,"When they had done this job of jobs,"
12955,BOOK XI.,"They durst not stay to pick their fobs,"
12956,BOOK XI.,"Hector was then so near them, they"
12957,BOOK XI.,Thought it was best to pop away.
12958,BOOK XI.,"Thus thieves, that wait the time to nick"
12959,BOOK XI.,"When they can best your pockets pick,"
12960,BOOK XI.,"Lurch till some bustle is begun,"
12961,BOOK XI.,"Then run and thieve, and thieve and run."
12962,BOOK XI.,
12963,BOOK XI.,"Merops' two sons, a hopeful pair,"
12964,BOOK XI.,Were seated in a one-horse chair:
12965,BOOK XI.,Their father carried once a pack
12966,BOOK XI.,Of caps and stockings on his back--
12967,BOOK XI.,"An honest plodding Highland wight,"
12968,BOOK XI.,And therefore born with second-sight:
12969,BOOK XI.,"From fighting he had warn'd the lads,"
12970,BOOK XI.,But younkers seldom mind their dads;
12971,BOOK XI.,In spite of him these younkers frisky
12972,BOOK XI.,Went out and hir'd a timmy whisky;
12973,BOOK XI.,"To his advice they paid no heed,"
12974,BOOK XI.,"But drove to meet this Diomede,"
12975,BOOK XI.,"Who, maugre all that they could do,"
12976,BOOK XI.,"Drubb'd 'em, and pick'd their pockets too."
12977,BOOK XI.,
12978,BOOK XI.,"Ulysses smash'd Hypirochus,"
12979,BOOK XI.,"And the rich Jew Hippodamus,"
12980,BOOK XI.,And made him rue he e'er did sally
12981,BOOK XI.,"From that great den of thieves, the Alley,"
12982,BOOK XI.,"Where had he staid, he might have bit"
12983,BOOK XI.,A thousand honest people yet.
12984,BOOK XI.,But Satan always doth forecast
12985,BOOK XI.,To lead rogues into scrapes at last.
12986,BOOK XI.,
12987,BOOK XI.,"Whilst things went on at six and seven,"
12988,BOOK XI.,"Jove smok'd a serious pipe in heaven,"
12989,BOOK XI.,And let old Gox's scales hang even;
12990,BOOK XI.,"Nor did he seem a whit to care,"
12991,BOOK XI.,"But let 'em scratch, fight dog fight bear."
12992,BOOK XI.,"On this the great Tydides strains out,"
12993,BOOK XI.,"And knocks Agastrophus's brains out,"
12994,BOOK XI.,"Who, busy fighting all the while,"
12995,BOOK XI.,Had left his cart above a mile;
12996,BOOK XI.,But when the honest Trojan saw
12997,BOOK XI.,"This bully Greek, he fled. Yet though"
12998,BOOK XI.,"He ran as if the devil split him,"
12999,BOOK XI.,This blackguard rascal's broomstick hit him:
13000,BOOK XI.,"Upon his wooden noddle falling,"
13001,BOOK XI.,"It broke his skull, and laid him sprawling."
13002,BOOK XI.,"Great Hector saw this fearful rout,"
13003,BOOK XI.,For he was looking sharp about:
13004,BOOK XI.,"As he mov'd on he loud did bawl,"
13005,BOOK XI.,"And with him brought the devil and all,"
13006,BOOK XI.,"A gang of downright Teagues, all rare men,"
13007,BOOK XI.,With bludgeons arm'd like Brentford chairmen.
13008,BOOK XI.,
13009,BOOK XI.,"Brave Diomede himself, who never"
13010,BOOK XI.,"Was us'd to fear, now felt his liver,"
13011,BOOK XI.,"Spite of his mighty courage, start,"
13012,BOOK XI.,And give a knock against his heart:
13013,BOOK XI.,"When thus he speaks--Ulysses, mind,"
13014,BOOK XI.,A plaguy storm before the wind
13015,BOOK XI.,"Comes rolling on, and I conjecture"
13016,BOOK XI.,"It can be nought but bully Hector,"
13017,BOOK XI.,"Who throws about his pots and kettles,"
13018,BOOK XI.,As if his bum was stung with nettles:
13019,BOOK XI.,Let us resolve in this here place
13020,BOOK XI.,To meet the rascal's ugly face.
13021,BOOK XI.,"Just as he spoke, to keep his fame up,"
13022,BOOK XI.,"He flung his stick as Hector came up,"
13023,BOOK XI.,Which lent the Trojan's leather cap
13024,BOOK XI.,"A most confounded banging rap,"
13025,BOOK XI.,"Bruis'd it, and sliding up, did lop"
13026,BOOK XI.,A tarnish'd tassel from the top:
13027,BOOK XI.,But by the care of sage Apollo
13028,BOOK XI.,It happen'd no great harm did follow;
13029,BOOK XI.,Though 'twas so sound a knock it stunn'd him
13030,BOOK XI.,"So much, that Hector rather shunn'd him,"
13031,BOOK XI.,"Mounted his cart, and whipp'd about"
13032,BOOK XI.,To try his luck another route.
13033,BOOK XI.,Tydides shouts Huzza! huzza!
13034,BOOK XI.,The hect'ring Hector's run away!
13035,BOOK XI.,Well doth Apollo pay that thief
13036,BOOK XI.,For all his knuckle-bones of beef;
13037,BOOK XI.,"If any witch would help a bit,"
13038,BOOK XI.,"By G-d, I'd swinge that rascal yet!"
13039,BOOK XI.,"But since he stoutly runs away for't,"
13040,BOOK XI.,I'll make his ragged scoundrels pay for't.
13041,BOOK XI.,"Then, though Agastrophus was dead,"
13042,BOOK XI.,"He lent him t'other knock o' th' head,"
13043,BOOK XI.,"To keep his hand in: now and then,"
13044,BOOK XI.,"Like Falstaff, he could kill dead men."
13045,BOOK XI.,
13046,BOOK XI.,"Paris, the keeper of the fair,"
13047,BOOK XI.,Whose piece of brittle china ware
13048,BOOK XI.,"Had caus'd this rout, that wenching knave,"
13049,BOOK XI.,Was peeping from the well-known grave
13050,BOOK XI.,"Of Ilus, an old brown-bread baker,"
13051,BOOK XI.,"Who being what we call a quaker,"
13052,BOOK XI.,"I' th' open fields his friends did leave him,"
13053,BOOK XI.,Because church-yards would not receive him--
13054,BOOK XI.,"Hearing this bully, what doth he"
13055,BOOK XI.,"But whips behind a hollow tree,"
13056,BOOK XI.,And just as Diom. down did squat
13057,BOOK XI.,To steal Agastrophus's hat.
13058,BOOK XI.,"Twang-dang he let his arrow go off,"
13059,BOOK XI.,And almost knock'd the bully's' toe off.
13060,BOOK XI.,The rogue behind the hollow tree
13061,BOOK XI.,"Laugh'd till he split his sides, to see"
13062,BOOK XI.,"The bully Grecian's odd grimaces,"
13063,BOOK XI.,He made such cursed ugly faces;
13064,BOOK XI.,"Then from his ambush leaping out,"
13065,BOOK XI.,"Diom., says he, you seem to pout,"
13066,BOOK XI.,As if you'd got the pox or gout:
13067,BOOK XI.,"I've hit, I find, the gouty part,"
13068,BOOK XI.,But wish Id reach'd your pluck or heart;
13069,BOOK XI.,Then would our Trojan bloods be free
13070,BOOK XI.,From dread of thy damn'd face and thee
13071,BOOK XI.,"Who tremble at thy phiz, and run"
13072,BOOK XI.,Faster than Paddy from a dun.
13073,BOOK XI.,
13074,BOOK XI.,"Diom. was marching off, but stopping,"
13075,BOOK XI.,"Replies, Ho! ho! Miss Frizzle Topping!"
13076,BOOK XI.,"I thought, when pop-gun arrows flew"
13077,BOOK XI.,It could be none but such as you;
13078,BOOK XI.,"Rogues that will boldly face a pox,"
13079,BOOK XI.,But dare as well be hang'd as box.
13080,BOOK XI.,What signifies thy slender touch?
13081,BOOK XI.,"Our cook-maid Doll could do as much,"
13082,BOOK XI.,Or more; her nails will reach the marrow
13083,BOOK XI.,As soon again as thy poor arrow.
13084,BOOK XI.,"But this good broomstaff ne'er flies waste,"
13085,BOOK XI.,As I one day will let thee taste;
13086,BOOK XI.,"Some Trojan gets, whene'er it goes,"
13087,BOOK XI.,A broken pate or bloody nose:
13088,BOOK XI.,"Whilst all their doxies, when they hear"
13089,BOOK XI.,"My name, begin to scold and swear,"
13090,BOOK XI.,Because I'm sure where'er I come
13091,BOOK XI.,To send their husbands limping home.
13092,BOOK XI.,
13093,BOOK XI.,"Whilst thus he prates, Ulysses, who"
13094,BOOK XI.,"Was much concern'd for his great toe,"
13095,BOOK XI.,"Pulls out the dart, and then doth pour in"
13096,BOOK XI.,"What offer'd first, and that was urine;"
13097,BOOK XI.,"Then laid his patient in a cart,"
13098,BOOK XI.,And bid 'em drive him pretty smart.
13099,BOOK XI.,"Now, when this bully-back was gone,"
13100,BOOK XI.,Ulysses found himself alone:
13101,BOOK XI.,"Whilst he was busy with the toe,"
13102,BOOK XI.,He never thought how things might go;
13103,BOOK XI.,"But when the Trojans up did walk,"
13104,BOOK XI.,He with himself began some talk:
13105,BOOK XI.,"I shall be smash'd if here I stay,"
13106,BOOK XI.,And yet I dare not run away;
13107,BOOK XI.,"For then they will not let me eat,"
13108,BOOK XI.,"And I shall starve without my meat,"
13109,BOOK XI.,"And soon be nought but skin and bone,"
13110,BOOK XI.,Like long sir Thomas R----n.
13111,BOOK XI.,Why should I longer then stand scrubbing?
13112,BOOK XI.,"Starving is ten times worse than drubbing,"
13113,BOOK XI.,"Whilst he was weighing thus the matter,"
13114,BOOK XI.,He heard the Trojan broomsticks clatter;
13115,BOOK XI.,"Before this talk was done they found him,"
13116,BOOK XI.,"And quickly made a circle round him,"
13117,BOOK XI.,Though his hard knocks did make 'em own
13118,BOOK XI.,They'd better let his pate alone.
13119,BOOK XI.,In Piccadilly thus I've seen
13120,BOOK XI.,A drunken ragged scolding quean
13121,BOOK XI.,By a large circle of the boys
13122,BOOK XI.,"Pursued with dirt, and mud, and noise:"
13123,BOOK XI.,"Whilst she stands still, and only scolds,"
13124,BOOK XI.,Each hardy boy his station holds;
13125,BOOK XI.,"But when or here or there she reels,"
13126,BOOK XI.,The younkers nimbly trust their heels.
13127,BOOK XI.,Just such another matter this is
13128,BOOK XI.,Betwixt the Trojans and Ulysses;
13129,BOOK XI.,His cudgel first he level'd at
13130,BOOK XI.,"And laid the bold Deiopis flat,"
13131,BOOK XI.,A taller fellow and a fatter
13132,BOOK XI.,"You never saw, except the hatter."
13133,BOOK XI.,"Next Ennomus, and Thoon too,"
13134,BOOK XI.,"Dealers in stone and powder blue,"
13135,BOOK XI.,Felt what this sturdy Greek could do.
13136,BOOK XI.,"Chersidamas, a noted brewer,"
13137,BOOK XI.,Who in his time had poison'd fewer
13138,BOOK XI.,"Than any of the brewing trade,"
13139,BOOK XI.,Next on the clay-cold ground was laid;
13140,BOOK XI.,"Across the guts Ulysses wip'd him,"
13141,BOOK XI.,And brew'd him up a stroke that grip'd him.
13142,BOOK XI.,"Charops, the son of old Hippases,"
13143,BOOK XI.,Who sold Scotch snuff and farthing laces
13144,BOOK XI.,"Under St. Dunstan's church, was nigh:"
13145,BOOK XI.,At him Ulysses soon let fly:
13146,BOOK XI.,"The broomstick quickly did his job,"
13147,BOOK XI.,And rung against his hollow nob.
13148,BOOK XI.,"Soccus, his bro. a noted tanner,"
13149,BOOK XI.,"And bailiff to the lord o' th' manor,"
13150,BOOK XI.,"Was nigh, and saw this lurching whelp"
13151,BOOK XI.,Slinging his stick--so ran to help
13152,BOOK XI.,His brother: but he found him tumbled;
13153,BOOK XI.,At which be sure his gizzard grumbled.
13154,BOOK XI.,"Curse your sly pate, says he, Ulysses!"
13155,BOOK XI.,"You lousy lurching scoundrel, this is"
13156,BOOK XI.,"One of your old damn'd roguish tricks,"
13157,BOOK XI.,This laming folks by flinging sticks:
13158,BOOK XI.,"But you shall fairly knock me down,"
13159,BOOK XI.,Or rot me but I'll crack your crown!
13160,BOOK XI.,"This said, his crabtree stick he long"
13161,BOOK XI.,Rattled about his ears ding-dong:
13162,BOOK XI.,"But the sly Grecian's nob, so thick,"
13163,BOOK XI.,Bid bold defiance to his stick;
13164,BOOK XI.,"On which the Trojan chang'd his stroke,"
13165,BOOK XI.,And with a Highland flourish broke
13166,BOOK XI.,Two of his ribs--when Pallas put
13167,BOOK XI.,"Her hand between, and say'd his gut."
13168,BOOK XI.,
13169,BOOK XI.,"Ulysses, though with pain it fill'd him,"
13170,BOOK XI.,Was pretty sure he had not kill'd him;
13171,BOOK XI.,"So drawing back a step or two,"
13172,BOOK XI.,"Soccus, says he, I think 'tis now"
13173,BOOK XI.,My turn to have a knock at you;
13174,BOOK XI.,And for the stroke you've been so civil
13175,BOOK XI.,"To give, I'll send you to the devil."
13176,BOOK XI.,"Whilst he was laying forth the case,"
13177,BOOK XI.,"He grinn'd with such an ugly face,"
13178,BOOK XI.,That Soccus really thought the elf
13179,BOOK XI.,Had been sir Beelzebub himself;
13180,BOOK XI.,"Which scar'd him so, he durst not stay,"
13181,BOOK XI.,But whipp'd about and ran away.
13182,BOOK XI.,"The flying broomstick reach'd his back,"
13183,BOOK XI.,And fell'd him down with such a whack
13184,BOOK XI.,"Against a stone, it cut his hat,"
13185,BOOK XI.,And beat his long sharp nose quite flat.
13186,BOOK XI.,"Then, as upon the ground they lay,"
13187,BOOK XI.,Ulysses thus was heard to say:
13188,BOOK XI.,"My Trojan friends, lie you two there"
13189,BOOK XI.,"Till Christmas next, for aught I care;"
13190,BOOK XI.,"Your mam. will hardly hither pop,"
13191,BOOK XI.,Nor can your daddy leave his shop
13192,BOOK XI.,To come your funeral to grace
13193,BOOK XI.,"With sable cloak, and crying face,"
13194,BOOK XI.,"But leaves that task to coffin-makers,"
13195,BOOK XI.,Or rueful long-phizz'd undertakers.
13196,BOOK XI.,"Now, when I die, I know our vicar"
13197,BOOK XI.,"Will make 'em bind my grave with wicker,"
13198,BOOK XI.,"Where all my friends, if right I think,"
13199,BOOK XI.,"Will drink and sob, and sob and drink."
13200,BOOK XI.,
13201,BOOK XI.,"Whilst he was jabb'ring in this strain,"
13202,BOOK XI.,His bruise began to give him pain;
13203,BOOK XI.,"Then lifting up his dirty shirt,"
13204,BOOK XI.,"He found he'd got a plaguy hurt,"
13205,BOOK XI.,"And, the misfortune still to crown,"
13206,BOOK XI.,The Trojans saw his blood run down;
13207,BOOK XI.,"Which made 'em press so close, the whelp"
13208,BOOK XI.,"Ran stoutly now, and roar'd for help."
13209,BOOK XI.,Thrice did Atrides hear him further
13210,BOOK XI.,Than fifty furlongs roar out Murder!
13211,BOOK XI.,On which the Spartan bully cried
13212,BOOK XI.,"To Ajax, who was at his side,"
13213,BOOK XI.,"I'm sure that something much amiss is,"
13214,BOOK XI.,For murder! murder! roars Ulysses;
13215,BOOK XI.,So wide his mouth would hardly gape
13216,BOOK XI.,Were he not in some cursed scrape;
13217,BOOK XI.,"To bring him off we both must run,"
13218,BOOK XI.,"Else, by my soul, we're all undone!"
13219,BOOK XI.,"For though he's strong, yet Ferdinando"
13220,BOOK XI.,Can do no more than one man can do;
13221,BOOK XI.,"And if of him we are bereft,"
13222,BOOK XI.,There is but one good counsel left.
13223,BOOK XI.,Though counsellors are understood
13224,BOOK XI.,"To do more harm, thrice told, than good,"
13225,BOOK XI.,"Yet here the rule don't fully hold,"
13226,BOOK XI.,For he can box as well as scold:
13227,BOOK XI.,But the damn'd knaves in Wranglers'-Hall
13228,BOOK XI.,Are good for nothing but to bawl;
13229,BOOK XI.,"And when you kick 'em for their jaw,"
13230,BOOK XI.,"They take the kicks, and take the law."
13231,BOOK XI.,
13232,BOOK XI.,Then where the roaring came from they
13233,BOOK XI.,With hasty strides direct their way;
13234,BOOK XI.,"'Twas lucky they so soon did stickle,"
13235,BOOK XI.,For he was in a grievous pickle;
13236,BOOK XI.,The smell was potent where he stood--
13237,BOOK XI.,'Tis an ill wind blows no man good;
13238,BOOK XI.,"For by its help they nos'd him out,"
13239,BOOK XI.,Though compass'd by his foes about.
13240,BOOK XI.,"As younkers at a country school,"
13241,BOOK XI.,"When they've a heap of apples stole,"
13242,BOOK XI.,"One youth, that he may fair divide."
13243,BOOK XI.,"Across the apples stands astride,"
13244,BOOK XI.,"When lo the master, dreadful case!"
13245,BOOK XI.,Pops in his unexpected face;
13246,BOOK XI.,"At his approach they scour away,"
13247,BOOK XI.,And leave the undivided prey;
13248,BOOK XI.,"The pedant then asserts his claim,"
13249,BOOK XI.,And bears the apples to his dame:
13250,BOOK XI.,Thus Ajax made 'em all run faster
13251,BOOK XI.,Than the boys scamper'd from their master;
13252,BOOK XI.,For when the late-exulting foe
13253,BOOK XI.,"His huge enormous broomstick saw,"
13254,BOOK XI.,"Who should get first away they strove,"
13255,BOOK XI.,And ran as if the devil drove.
13256,BOOK XI.,"On this great Menelaus pisses,"
13257,BOOK XI.,"Then went to help his friend Ulysses,"
13258,BOOK XI.,"And part by strength, and part by art,"
13259,BOOK XI.,Got him shov'd up into a cart;
13260,BOOK XI.,Whilst Ajax with his stick pursu'd
13261,BOOK XI.,"The flying, frighten'd, routed crowd,"
13262,BOOK XI.,"Paid 'em about, but first begun"
13263,BOOK XI.,"With Doryclus, old Priam's son,"
13264,BOOK XI.,A youth that often walk'd the Park
13265,BOOK XI.,To pick up wenches in the dark.
13266,BOOK XI.,"Pandocus next he struck hap-hazard,"
13267,BOOK XI.,And laid his stick across his mazzard.
13268,BOOK XI.,"With so much force, it made his mouth ache,"
13269,BOOK XI.,And gave him a d--d fit o' th' tooth-ache.
13270,BOOK XI.,"The pimp at Haddock's bagnio,"
13271,BOOK XI.,"Pyrasas, felt the next great blow;"
13272,BOOK XI.,"Ajax a swingeing broomstick threw,"
13273,BOOK XI.,"That bruis'd his rump all black and blue,"
13274,BOOK XI.,"Which paid the rascal well for pimping,"
13275,BOOK XI.,And sent him to his brothel limping.
13276,BOOK XI.,"Lysander next, an Irish broker,"
13277,BOOK XI.,"A mettled fellow and a joker,"
13278,BOOK XI.,"Met with this clumsy Grecian cock,"
13279,BOOK XI.,"And got a most infernal knock,"
13280,BOOK XI.,"Made him so sick, he fell to bokeing,"
13281,BOOK XI.,And for a twelvemonth spoil'd his joking.
13282,BOOK XI.,"Palertes last, a freeborn Troyman,"
13283,BOOK XI.,"A noted jeweller and toyman,"
13284,BOOK XI.,"Got tumbled down, whilst all his toys"
13285,BOOK XI.,Made a confounded clatt'ring noise.
13286,BOOK XI.,"Thus, when you 'gin to smell a stink,"
13287,BOOK XI.,"You pump away to clear the sink,"
13288,BOOK XI.,"A deluge issues through the grates,"
13289,BOOK XI.,"And drives down rotten shrimps and sprats,"
13290,BOOK XI.,"Tumbles the garbage o'er and o'er,"
13291,BOOK XI.,Till it has reach'd the common shore:
13292,BOOK XI.,Just so before him as he rumbled
13293,BOOK XI.,"Both carts, and men, and horses tumbled."
13294,BOOK XI.,
13295,BOOK XI.,"Hector was to the left a mile,"
13296,BOOK XI.,"Pelting the Grecians all the while,"
13297,BOOK XI.,Kicking the ragged sons of bitches
13298,BOOK XI.,By dozens into muddy ditches:
13299,BOOK XI.,"There Nestor and the Cretan stood,"
13300,BOOK XI.,And stopp'd his kicking all they could:
13301,BOOK XI.,"But, spite of them, this furious loon"
13302,BOOK XI.,Kick'd the poor rogues like nine-pins down.
13303,BOOK XI.,"Paris, who rode Atrides' boot in,"
13304,BOOK XI.,"Was practising the art of shooting,"
13305,BOOK XI.,That he might make his aim more certain
13306,BOOK XI.,"Than Wilkes himself, or even Martin,"
13307,BOOK XI.,Took opportunity i' th' nick
13308,BOOK XI.,To lend the Grecian quack a prick:
13309,BOOK XI.,"The arrow made his shoulder smack,"
13310,BOOK XI.,And the Greeks trembled for their quack.
13311,BOOK XI.,The Cretan then to Nestor spoke:
13312,BOOK XI.,"Come here, old weather-beaten rock,"
13313,BOOK XI.,I've better business far for you
13314,BOOK XI.,Than aught you can by boxing do;
13315,BOOK XI.,"Go take your higler's cart, and lay on"
13316,BOOK XI.,"The wounded doctor, Don Machaon,"
13317,BOOK XI.,"And drive him off; if he is lost,"
13318,BOOK XI.,We all may feel it to our cost:
13319,BOOK XI.,"You know it well, nor you alone,"
13320,BOOK XI.,He cures more kinds of wounds than one;
13321,BOOK XI.,"And but for his great skill, you know"
13322,BOOK XI.,You had been rotten long ago.
13323,BOOK XI.,"Nestor obeys, and sans delay"
13324,BOOK XI.,Convey'd the wounded quack away.
13325,BOOK XI.,And with an almost fire-new thong
13326,BOOK XI.,Dusted his raw-bon'd tits along;
13327,BOOK XI.,"And as his geldings lamely tripp'd,"
13328,BOOK XI.,"He whipp'd and cough'd, and cough'd and whipp'd."
13329,BOOK XI.,
13330,BOOK XI.,"Now Hector's carter, who could see"
13331,BOOK XI.,"Above as far again as he,"
13332,BOOK XI.,"Looking the Trojan files along,"
13333,BOOK XI.,Soon saw where things were going wrong;
13334,BOOK XI.,"Whilst here we fight genteel and civil,"
13335,BOOK XI.,"Quoth he, there's Ajax plays the devil;"
13336,BOOK XI.,"Mind how the bully swears and curses,"
13337,BOOK XI.,And oversets both carts and horses;
13338,BOOK XI.,"I know the whelp by one sure sign,"
13339,BOOK XI.,His fist's as big as three of mine.
13340,BOOK XI.,Then let's be jogging to assist
13341,BOOK XI.,"Our friends to 'scape his mutton fist,"
13342,BOOK XI.,"Else, by our mighty Trojan founders!"
13343,BOOK XI.,He'll lay 'em all as flat as flounders.
13344,BOOK XI.,"He said no more, but quickly got"
13345,BOOK XI.,His geldings smack'd into a trot;
13346,BOOK XI.,"O'er legs and arms he drove so smart,"
13347,BOOK XI.,"He sprink'd the foot-board of the cart,"
13348,BOOK XI.,And daub'd it rarely with the stains
13349,BOOK XI.,"Of blood and mud, and guts and brains,"
13350,BOOK XI.,"Which fill'd the axle-tree so full,"
13351,BOOK XI.,The horses had a far worse pull
13352,BOOK XI.,"Than if they'd lugg'd a brewer's dray,"
13353,BOOK XI.,Or country waggon full of hay.
13354,BOOK XI.,
13355,BOOK XI.,The Grecians thought by standing close
13356,BOOK XI.,To keep him out: but such a dose
13357,BOOK XI.,"With his oak stick the Trojan gave 'em,"
13358,BOOK XI.,They trusted to their heels to save 'em;
13359,BOOK XI.,"Whilst he their sides so nimbly switch'd,"
13360,BOOK XI.,They thought the fellow was bewitch'd.
13361,BOOK XI.,"Then from his cart he ply'd 'em thick,"
13362,BOOK XI.,"With first a broomstick, then a brick,"
13363,BOOK XI.,And fell'd 'em down with just such knocks
13364,BOOK XI.,"As bumkins lend their Shrovetide cocks,"
13365,BOOK XI.,"Flinging his sticks at such a rate,"
13366,BOOK XI.,He always broke a leg or pate.
13367,BOOK XI.,By such hard knocks as these he made
13368,BOOK XI.,"The Greeks so horribly afraid,"
13369,BOOK XI.,That they employ'd their utmost might in
13370,BOOK XI.,"Running away, instead of fighting;"
13371,BOOK XI.,"And Ajax felt such queerish twitches,"
13372,BOOK XI.,His courage jump'd into his breeches:
13373,BOOK XI.,"He therefore found; when folks begun for't,"
13374,BOOK XI.,His own thick legs dispos'd to run for't;
13375,BOOK XI.,But taking care that none should say
13376,BOOK XI.,"Great Ajax ran, he walk'd away,"
13377,BOOK XI.,"And, lest they should his rear attack,"
13378,BOOK XI.,He kept a constant peeping back.
13379,BOOK XI.,"Thus on an evening have I seen,"
13380,BOOK XI.,"With pious face on Bethnal-Green,"
13381,BOOK XI.,"An inspir'd cobbler mount a tub,"
13382,BOOK XI.,And preach to ev'ry ragged scrub:
13383,BOOK XI.,"Though dirt and rotten eggs flew round,"
13384,BOOK XI.,"Yet inspiration kept his ground,"
13385,BOOK XI.,"Nor, till he'd preach'd his sermon out,"
13386,BOOK XI.,"Would stir a step, and then did do't"
13387,BOOK XI.,With as much gravity as if
13388,BOOK XI.,To be inspir'd was to be stiff.
13389,BOOK XI.,Thus heavy Ajax bore the cuffings
13390,BOOK XI.,"Of all the Trojan raggamuffins,"
13391,BOOK XI.,And walk'd as slow as if he'd been
13392,BOOK XI.,The preaching cobbler of the Green:
13393,BOOK XI.,"In Spanish strides his knees he bent,"
13394,BOOK XI.,And grumbled all the way he went.
13395,BOOK XI.,Thus have I seen a sand-cart ass
13396,BOOK XI.,Devour a farmers clover-grass:
13397,BOOK XI.,"The farmer, with his wife and man,"
13398,BOOK XI.,To drive him out do all they can;
13399,BOOK XI.,But though they pour a heavy tide
13400,BOOK XI.,"Of rattling hedgestakes on his side,"
13401,BOOK XI.,"The beast, as patient as he's dull,"
13402,BOOK XI.,"Eats till he crams his belly full,"
13403,BOOK XI.,"And then, insensible of pain,"
13404,BOOK XI.,Deliberately walks off again.
13405,BOOK XI.,"Whilst Ajax strutted off demurely,"
13406,BOOK XI.,The Trojans bang'd his potlid purely;
13407,BOOK XI.,Sometimes he turn'd about to swear
13408,BOOK XI.,He'd break their bones if they came near;
13409,BOOK XI.,"Then march'd away, but, as he trod,"
13410,BOOK XI.,Threaten'd them with an angry nod;
13411,BOOK XI.,"Whilst they, to keep up this queer battle,"
13412,BOOK XI.,With brickbats made his potlid rattle.
13413,BOOK XI.,
13414,BOOK XI.,"Euripylus, who saw them skelp him,"
13415,BOOK XI.,"Resolv'd at any rate to help him,"
13416,BOOK XI.,And did his knotty broomstaff lay on
13417,BOOK XI.,"The Trojan hosier, Apisaon,"
13418,BOOK XI.,"Whose nob he lent a knock that broke it,"
13419,BOOK XI.,At which he ran to pick his pocket.
13420,BOOK XI.,Paris was ever on the watch
13421,BOOK XI.,These low pick-pocket rogues to catch;
13422,BOOK XI.,"He hated all such dirty jobs,"
13423,BOOK XI.,"As stealing hats, and picking fobs:"
13424,BOOK XI.,"Not but the dog himself, 'twas said,"
13425,BOOK XI.,"Would oft pick up--a maiden-head,"
13426,BOOK XI.,"But then he thought no sin lay there,"
13427,BOOK XI.,Because 'twas perishable ware;
13428,BOOK XI.,In other things he was in truth
13429,BOOK XI.,"A very good church-going youth,"
13430,BOOK XI.,"Of th' catechize could read some part,"
13431,BOOK XI.,And say the whole Lord's prayer by heart--
13432,BOOK XI.,He saw this pilf'ring Grecian lout
13433,BOOK XI.,Turn Apisaon's pockets out;
13434,BOOK XI.,"On which he let an arrow fly,"
13435,BOOK XI.,"That tore his breeks, and cut his thigh,"
13436,BOOK XI.,Made the rogue sweat and grin with pain.
13437,BOOK XI.,And sent him hobbling back again.
13438,BOOK XI.,"But yet before he stirr'd one bit,"
13439,BOOK XI.,He made a speech; and this is it:
13440,BOOK XI.,"O Greeks, I fear your courage fails ye,"
13441,BOOK XI.,"In God's name, what the devil ails ye?"
13442,BOOK XI.,I've left poor Ajax in a sweat;
13443,BOOK XI.,And if you do not quickly get
13444,BOOK XI.,"To his assistance, I'll be shot"
13445,BOOK XI.,But his hard nob must go to pot!
13446,BOOK XI.,"The Trojans do so sorely pelt,"
13447,BOOK XI.,That if his potlid and his belt
13448,BOOK XI.,"Did not secure his rump so gummy,"
13449,BOOK XI.,His buttocks must be thrash'd to mummy:
13450,BOOK XI.,"And if you could but see 'em now,"
13451,BOOK XI.,I'll answer for't they're black and blue!
13452,BOOK XI.,"For God's sake, neighbours, run and help him,"
13453,BOOK XI.,You'd wonder how the rascals skelp him.
13454,BOOK XI.,
13455,BOOK XI.,"Whilst he was speaking, from the rout"
13456,BOOK XI.,About a dozen fellows stout
13457,BOOK XI.,"Took heart of grace, and ventured out;"
13458,BOOK XI.,"Some held their leathern potlids o'er him,"
13459,BOOK XI.,And others clapp'd their staves before him.
13460,BOOK XI.,"Whilst thus their fainting friend they shroud,"
13461,BOOK XI.,Ajax struts up and joins the crowd;
13462,BOOK XI.,"Then on a sudden, growing stout,"
13463,BOOK XI.,"He puff'd his cheeks, and fac'd about."
13464,BOOK XI.,
13465,BOOK XI.,"Thus things went on, and all the while"
13466,BOOK XI.,"Nestor had jerk'd his tits a mile,"
13467,BOOK XI.,And with a wondrous deal of flogging
13468,BOOK XI.,Made a hard shift to keep them jogging;
13469,BOOK XI.,"Smoking with sweat, amidst the throng,"
13470,BOOK XI.,They lugg'd the wounded quack along.
13471,BOOK XI.,"Just then Achilles, as 'tis said,"
13472,BOOK XI.,"Was sitting at the main-mast head,"
13473,BOOK XI.,"From whence he saw the Greeks all spent,"
13474,BOOK XI.,And cudgel'd to their hearts' content;
13475,BOOK XI.,With joy he saw the Trojans lay on
13476,BOOK XI.,"The bones of all, except Machaon."
13477,BOOK XI.,"As for the doctor, 'cause that he"
13478,BOOK XI.,"Once cur'd him of a gonorrhæ,"
13479,BOOK XI.,"Besides a hoarseness and a pthisic,"
13480,BOOK XI.,"And charg'd but eighteen-pence for physic,"
13481,BOOK XI.,He therefore felt a little touch
13482,BOOK XI.,"Of pity, though it was not much;"
13483,BOOK XI.,"When casting down his eyes below,"
13484,BOOK XI.,Patroclus working hard he saw
13485,BOOK XI.,Mending an old blue rusty jacket
13486,BOOK XI.,So torn he'd much ado to tack it;
13487,BOOK XI.,On which he to his chum below
13488,BOOK XI.,"Roars out, Halloo, my buff, halloo!"
13489,BOOK XI.,
13490,BOOK XI.,Patroclus then began to lug
13491,BOOK XI.,"From his left jaw a fine large plug,"
13492,BOOK XI.,"Then clear'd his throat, and spit and cough'd,"
13493,BOOK XI.,"And halloo'd out, Who calls aloft?"
13494,BOOK XI.,"Stop, avast[2] heaving; is it you?"
13495,BOOK XI.,What have you got for me to do?
13496,BOOK XI.,"Whate'er you want by sea or land,"
13497,BOOK XI.,Keel-haul me but I'll lend a hand!
13498,BOOK XI.,
13499,BOOK XI.,Achilles thus: Through various rubs
13500,BOOK XI.,We two have long been loving scrubs!
13501,BOOK XI.,With joy my very heart doth tickle
13502,BOOK XI.,To find the Greeks in such a pickle!
13503,BOOK XI.,"Though their chub-headed chief did flout me,"
13504,BOOK XI.,I knew they could not do without me;
13505,BOOK XI.,"Soon they'll be here with sobs and moans,"
13506,BOOK XI.,And down upon their marrow-bones.
13507,BOOK XI.,"But I want you, my chum, to go"
13508,BOOK XI.,"To Nestor's oyster-boat, to know"
13509,BOOK XI.,What made him flog his founder'd cattle
13510,BOOK XI.,"In such a splutter from the battle,"
13511,BOOK XI.,And if he did not lug some cock
13512,BOOK XI.,Whose pate or ribs had got a knock.
13513,BOOK XI.,I fear it is our trusty quack;
13514,BOOK XI.,"But I could only see his back,"
13515,BOOK XI.,Nor for my blood and guts could I
13516,BOOK XI.,"A corner of his face espy,"
13517,BOOK XI.,(Though I with all my eyes did look)
13518,BOOK XI.,The horses did so puff and smoke.
13519,BOOK XI.,
13520,BOOK XI.,"Patroclus then shook off his fleas,"
13521,BOOK XI.,"And button'd both his breeches-knees,"
13522,BOOK XI.,"Fetch'd his best hat, and then did scour--"
13523,BOOK XI.,"But in a sad unlucky hour,"
13524,BOOK XI.,"In a curs'd minute was he sent,"
13525,BOOK XI.,For Hector made him soon repent.
13526,BOOK XI.,"Howe'er that be, through all the throng"
13527,BOOK XI.,"Of boats and huts he popp'd along,"
13528,BOOK XI.,"And soon the queer old Grecian met,"
13529,BOOK XI.,Just lighted in a reeking sweat.
13530,BOOK XI.,Eurymedon with care and art
13531,BOOK XI.,Unloos'd his horses from the cart;
13532,BOOK XI.,"Nestor, who was confounded hot"
13533,BOOK XI.,"With flogging, had a dishclout got,"
13534,BOOK XI.,Which serv'd to wipe his greasy face:
13535,BOOK XI.,"And ere he put it in its place,"
13536,BOOK XI.,"Close by the wounded quack he stood,"
13537,BOOK XI.,And wip'd away both sweat and blood;
13538,BOOK XI.,Then gap'd awhile to catch a breeze
13539,BOOK XI.,Was coming fresh from off the seas;
13540,BOOK XI.,But staid not long before they went
13541,BOOK XI.,To seek for shelter in the tent.
13542,BOOK XI.,"Nestor then order'd Hecomede,"
13543,BOOK XI.,A red-hair'd wench of royal breed
13544,BOOK XI.,"(Which Greece to give th' old cock agreed,"
13545,BOOK XI.,"To keep of girls his slender stock up,"
13546,BOOK XI.,"And use when he could wind his clock up),"
13547,BOOK XI.,"Without delay to fetch a cup,"
13548,BOOK XI.,And make a cooling mixture up.
13549,BOOK XI.,But first this handmaid held it meet
13550,BOOK XI.,"Before they drank to make 'em eat,"
13551,BOOK XI.,So spread a table with blue feet
13552,BOOK XI.,"Made of good fir, which he had bought"
13553,BOOK XI.,In Broker's-alley for a groat;
13554,BOOK XI.,"Whereon she plac'd a spanking dish,"
13555,BOOK XI.,"Then fill'd it full, but not with fish;"
13556,BOOK XI.,"Of better stuff she pour'd a flood in,"
13557,BOOK XI.,And that was smoking hasty-pudding;
13558,BOOK XI.,"With this she mix'd, for this old coney-"
13559,BOOK XI.,"Catcher, an honest pint of honey,"
13560,BOOK XI.,Then rubb'd a salted garlic head
13561,BOOK XI.,"Upon a mouldy crust of bread,"
13562,BOOK XI.,"This done, a bowl that formerly"
13563,BOOK XI.,"Belong'd the taylors' company,"
13564,BOOK XI.,And giv'n th'old Greek for his advice
13565,BOOK XI.,"'Bout cabbage, cucumbers, and lice,"
13566,BOOK XI.,Matters of great concern and weight
13567,BOOK XI.,To this large body corporate
13568,BOOK XI.,"Of cross-legg'd thieves, who earn their bread"
13569,BOOK XI.,"By buckram, staytapes, silk, and thread;"
13570,BOOK XI.,To make it fine the taylors' beadles
13571,BOOK XI.,Had stuck it full of ends of needles.
13572,BOOK XI.,Now you must know this bowl of wood
13573,BOOK XI.,Upon a pair of cross-legs stood;
13574,BOOK XI.,About a dozen wooden pegs
13575,BOOK XI.,Fasten'd this pair of bandy legs;
13576,BOOK XI.,"Four handles did the sides adorn,"
13577,BOOK XI.,Two made of wood and two of horn;
13578,BOOK XI.,"(Two out of four of horn were made,"
13579,BOOK XI.,To show the fate of half the trade);
13580,BOOK XI.,O' th' top of each of which a pair
13581,BOOK XI.,"Of heads resembling snipes did stare,"
13582,BOOK XI.,"With beaks so sharp, in many a case"
13583,BOOK XI.,Of bodkins they supply'd the place.
13584,BOOK XI.,"Three quarts it held, and yet when full"
13585,BOOK XI.,Could this old soaker at a pull
13586,BOOK XI.,Drink it half off and never sob;
13587,BOOK XI.,But few with him could bear a bob.
13588,BOOK XI.,"This bowl the nymph of high degree,"
13589,BOOK XI.,"As handsome as a cook should be,"
13590,BOOK XI.,"Fill'd with the drink of which I boasted,"
13591,BOOK XI.,Rare Yorkshire ale with apples roasted.
13592,BOOK XI.,This for the quack did she prepare;
13593,BOOK XI.,But Nestor got the better share;
13594,BOOK XI.,'Twould do you good to see the pull
13595,BOOK XI.,Th' old soaker took of this lamb's-wool[3];
13596,BOOK XI.,"And all his life he did forecast,"
13597,BOOK XI.,To get the first tip and the last.
13598,BOOK XI.,
13599,BOOK XI.,"Their thirst being partly quench'd, they chatter"
13600,BOOK XI.,"Of this and that, and t'other matter;"
13601,BOOK XI.,"And though Patroclus now drew near,"
13602,BOOK XI.,They made such din they could not hear
13603,BOOK XI.,"Nor see him, till he did present"
13604,BOOK XI.,His proper self before the tent.
13605,BOOK XI.,"Nestor then starting makes a stir,"
13606,BOOK XI.,"And cries, Your humble servant, sir!"
13607,BOOK XI.,"I'm mighty glad to see you here,"
13608,BOOK XI.,Please to walk in and take a chair.
13609,BOOK XI.,
13610,BOOK XI.,"Patroclus thus: I cannot sit,"
13611,BOOK XI.,But with your leave will stand a bit;
13612,BOOK XI.,"For I have heard my granny say,"
13613,BOOK XI.,"That whilst you stand, you do not stay."
13614,BOOK XI.,"Achilles saw your cart go past,"
13615,BOOK XI.,And therefore sent me out post haste
13616,BOOK XI.,To learn what Grecian your old cattle
13617,BOOK XI.,Were lugging from the field of battle;
13618,BOOK XI.,"But to my grief I plainly view,"
13619,BOOK XI.,"Old friend Machaon, it was you."
13620,BOOK XI.,"I know, although I am no wizard,"
13621,BOOK XI.,"Achilles will be vex'd to th' gizzard,"
13622,BOOK XI.,To find your nags came puffing with
13623,BOOK XI.,Our bold and learned p----  smith:
13624,BOOK XI.,This news however I will carry
13625,BOOK XI.,"With speed, so ask me not to tarry."
13626,BOOK XI.,I'll tell him what I see and hear
13627,BOOK XI.,"But if I stay, you know he'll swear."
13628,BOOK XI.,
13629,BOOK XI.,Nestor replies: I fear Achilles
13630,BOOK XI.,In a d--d sulky humour still is:
13631,BOOK XI.,"But if he really asks about us,"
13632,BOOK XI.,"And did not send you here to flout us,"
13633,BOOK XI.,"I'll tell you all, for this misfortune"
13634,BOOK XI.,Is nought to what's behind the curtain.
13635,BOOK XI.,This learned skilful doctor's not
13636,BOOK XI.,The only hero that has got
13637,BOOK XI.,A broken shin or kick o' th' a--:
13638,BOOK XI.,But many a fierce-look'd son of Mars
13639,BOOK XI.,As bold as major Sturgeon's fled
13640,BOOK XI.,To cure a broken shin or head.
13641,BOOK XI.,"Nay several bruisers, men of note,"
13642,BOOK XI.,Have got their teeth knock'd down their throat;
13643,BOOK XI.,Ulysses has got such a stroke
13644,BOOK XI.,"That naif his ribs are almost broke,"
13645,BOOK XI.,And some damn'd heavy-footed foe
13646,BOOK XI.,Has trod upon poor Diom.'s toe;
13647,BOOK XI.,"Besides, the blood by gallons flows"
13648,BOOK XI.,From great Eurypylus's nose.
13649,BOOK XI.,"But whether we are drubb'd or not,"
13650,BOOK XI.,Achilles doth not mind a jot;
13651,BOOK XI.,"Nay, should the Trojans burn our fleet,"
13652,BOOK XI.,I reckon he'll be glad to see't:
13653,BOOK XI.,"Greek after Greek gets rapp'd o' th' knuckles,"
13654,BOOK XI.,Whilst he sits still and grins and chuckles.
13655,BOOK XI.,"The devil fetch old Time, I say,"
13656,BOOK XI.,For stealing all my strength away!
13657,BOOK XI.,O that I was but half as strong
13658,BOOK XI.,As when I drove the world along!
13659,BOOK XI.,"From Elis fetch'd a roaring bull,"
13660,BOOK XI.,And crack'd their general's thick skull:
13661,BOOK XI.,"Then drove th' Epeans all like thunder,"
13662,BOOK XI.,And got the Lord knows what of plunder;
13663,BOOK XI.,"Their herds of sheep when we did meet 'em,"
13664,BOOK XI.,We very seldom fail'd to eat 'em;
13665,BOOK XI.,"Then stole their breeding mares, all big"
13666,BOOK XI.,"With foal, and many a goat and pig."
13667,BOOK XI.,"These things I did when but a boy,"
13668,BOOK XI.,And made my daddy jump for joy.
13669,BOOK XI.,"Elis, thus basted, hung their ears,"
13670,BOOK XI.,And grumbling paid their old arrears;
13671,BOOK XI.,"And Pylian knights, so special poor"
13672,BOOK XI.,They turn'd a farthing three times o'er
13673,BOOK XI.,"Before it went, now found their breeches'"
13674,BOOK XI.,Pockets too shallow for their riches.
13675,BOOK XI.,"When Elis first came out to dare us,"
13676,BOOK XI.,"They thought they easily could scare us,"
13677,BOOK XI.,"Because one Hercules, a bully,"
13678,BOOK XI.,Had almost done our business fully:
13679,BOOK XI.,"Twelve lads my father got, and he"
13680,BOOK XI.,Demolish'd ev'ry soul but me.
13681,BOOK XI.,"Howe'er, we ventur'd out to kick 'em,"
13682,BOOK XI.,"Resolv'd to lose our lives, or lick 'em;"
13683,BOOK XI.,"Which, 'faith! we did, and made 'em glad"
13684,BOOK XI.,To give to my old crusty dad
13685,BOOK XI.,Three dozen ewes--they ow'd him that
13686,BOOK XI.,For cheating him o' th' gold-lac'd hat
13687,BOOK XI.,Which he had won at May-day fair
13688,BOOK XI.,By proving the best cudgel-player;
13689,BOOK XI.,Both his lac'd hat and cudgel too
13690,BOOK XI.,"The constable detain'd, but now"
13691,BOOK XI.,We made the rogues severely rue.
13692,BOOK XI.,"What more we got, myself dealt out"
13693,BOOK XI.,Amongst our jolly boys so stout.
13694,BOOK XI.,"But in three days they came again,"
13695,BOOK XI.,"Both horses, carts, and drunken men."
13696,BOOK XI.,"Old Actor's sons, two bullying roysters,"
13697,BOOK XI.,Whose mother sells fine Welflit oysters
13698,BOOK XI.,Under a bulk in Drury-lane--
13699,BOOK XI.,These bastards led this drunken train.
13700,BOOK XI.,"Thryoessa, a pretty village,"
13701,BOOK XI.,"Not fam'd, as you may think, for tillage,"
13702,BOOK XI.,"Because upon a rock it lay,"
13703,BOOK XI.,Was the last place we had that way;
13704,BOOK XI.,"That little town, if you'll inquire,"
13705,BOOK XI.,Ended the bound of Pylos' shire:
13706,BOOK XI.,"'Twas there the rascals came to see us,"
13707,BOOK XI.,And cross'd a dyke they call Alpheus;
13708,BOOK XI.,"But Pallas came one foggy night,"
13709,BOOK XI.,"Turn out, says she, my boys, and fight."
13710,BOOK XI.,"On which with speed we left our rock,"
13711,BOOK XI.,And march'd to give the dogs a knock.
13712,BOOK XI.,"I first got ready; but my dad,"
13713,BOOK XI.,"Afraid lest they should hurt his lad,"
13714,BOOK XI.,"Lock'd up my boots and jacket too,"
13715,BOOK XI.,And d--d his eyes if I should go!
13716,BOOK XI.,"But wilful I resolv'd to do't,"
13717,BOOK XI.,So tramp'd it all the way on foot.
13718,BOOK XI.,"By Minyas stream we push'd the bowl,"
13719,BOOK XI.,Whilst we look'd o'er the muster-roll;
13720,BOOK XI.,And long before the day begun
13721,BOOK XI.,"All got their buff-skin doublets on,"
13722,BOOK XI.,"Except myself, for I had none:"
13723,BOOK XI.,"And all our bucks were cloth'd so bare,"
13724,BOOK XI.,Not one had got a coat to spare
13725,BOOK XI.,Then trudg'd it to the very border
13726,BOOK XI.,"Of Alpheus' stream, in train-band order."
13727,BOOK XI.,"Quickly, to set all right above,"
13728,BOOK XI.,"We cook'd a dinner up for Jove,"
13729,BOOK XI.,"Of something very good and hot,"
13730,BOOK XI.,Though what it was I've quite forgot:
13731,BOOK XI.,"Minerva had a dinner too,"
13732,BOOK XI.,The udder of a rare old cow:
13733,BOOK XI.,"Alpheus came a meal to seek,"
13734,BOOK XI.,For him we stew'd a fine bull's cheek.
13735,BOOK XI.,"Neptune, we knew, was stall'd with fish,"
13736,BOOK XI.,We therefore cook'd him up a dish
13737,BOOK XI.,"Of lean bull-beef with cabbage fried,"
13738,BOOK XI.,And a full pot of beer beside:
13739,BOOK XI.,"Bubble[4], they call this dish, and squeak;"
13740,BOOK XI.,Our taylors dine on't thrice a week.
13741,BOOK XI.,"By th' water-side the men all kept,"
13742,BOOK XI.,"And in their buff-skin doublets slept,"
13743,BOOK XI.,All but poor me; but here I had
13744,BOOK XI.,Borrow'd an itchy lousy plaid
13745,BOOK XI.,"Of a Scotch loon, from whom I bought"
13746,BOOK XI.,A rare good neckcloth for a groat--
13747,BOOK XI.,"Those plaids are special things to watch in,"
13748,BOOK XI.,They keep a man so warm with scratching.
13749,BOOK XI.,"Th' Epeans, with their loins all bound"
13750,BOOK XI.,"In carriers' belts, our town surround."
13751,BOOK XI.,Soon as the red-fac'd fiery Sun
13752,BOOK XI.,"Had curl'd his whiskers, and begun"
13753,BOOK XI.,"To look about him, we to battle"
13754,BOOK XI.,"March'd out, and made their noddles rattle."
13755,BOOK XI.,"And now I box'd it in my waistcoat,"
13756,BOOK XI.,Better than some that had a lac'd coat:
13757,BOOK XI.,"King Augeas' son I tumbled down,"
13758,BOOK XI.,"And with a thumping knock o' th' crown,"
13759,BOOK XI.,Gave a confounded broken head
13760,BOOK XI.,"To this great spouse of Agamede,"
13761,BOOK XI.,"A girl so skilful, that she knew,"
13762,BOOK XI.,"Amongst all kind of herbs that grew,"
13763,BOOK XI.,None made such bitter drink as rue.
13764,BOOK XI.,"I seiz'd his cart when he was down,"
13765,BOOK XI.,And swore I'd keep it for my own.
13766,BOOK XI.,"My men huzza'd as I led on,"
13767,BOOK XI.,"And made the drunken scoundrels run,"
13768,BOOK XI.,Just like a whirlwind which in town
13769,BOOK XI.,Drives butchers'-stalls and green-shops down.
13770,BOOK XI.,"I smok'd the rogues, my cudgel maul'd 'em,"
13771,BOOK XI.,And my sharp-pointed broomshaft gall'd em;
13772,BOOK XI.,Full fifty carts that day I took--
13773,BOOK XI.,"'Tis true, my friends! for all you look"
13774,BOOK XI.,"As much surpris'd as if that I,"
13775,BOOK XI.,"Like statesmen, had a mind to try"
13776,BOOK XI.,To hum you with a thund'ring lie.
13777,BOOK XI.,Now you must know each cart I got
13778,BOOK XI.,Contained two bully-backs of note--
13779,BOOK XI.,"None of your wishy-washy sparks,"
13780,BOOK XI.,Attorneys' hacks and lawyers' clerks;
13781,BOOK XI.,"But farmers' sons, rare strong-back'd youths,"
13782,BOOK XI.,With mutton-fists and flounder-mouths:
13783,BOOK XI.,"But when we came to a dispute,"
13784,BOOK XI.,I kick'd the wide-mouth'd scoundrels out
13785,BOOK XI.,"Two in each cart, you say? Why then"
13786,BOOK XI.,You must have kick'd a hundred men
13787,BOOK XI.,"Out of their carts that day--'Tis true, sir,"
13788,BOOK XI.,"I've men alive will vouch it now, sir!"
13789,BOOK XI.,"And Actor's sons, I would, as surely"
13790,BOOK XI.,"As you stand there, have drubb'd 'em purely;"
13791,BOOK XI.,"But Neptune saw the whole, and tried."
13792,BOOK XI.,"With all his speed to take their side,"
13793,BOOK XI.,Because the mother of those roysters
13794,BOOK XI.,Was a good customer for oysters.
13795,BOOK XI.,"To save their bacon, what doth he"
13796,BOOK XI.,"But pops a cloud 'twixt them and me,"
13797,BOOK XI.,"So thick, one mouthful did, I'm sure,"
13798,BOOK XI.,Make me stand coughing half an hour!
13799,BOOK XI.,"And there you might have seen me stuck up,"
13800,BOOK XI.,Boaking as if I'd bring my pluck up:
13801,BOOK XI.,And would have given any money
13802,BOOK XI.,For Doctor Hill's balsamic honey.
13803,BOOK XI.,But still I drove the rest in flocks
13804,BOOK XI.,As far as the Olinian rocks:
13805,BOOK XI.,"Then, where Aliseum's waters drop,"
13806,BOOK XI.,"Pallas call'd out, Plague on you! stop."
13807,BOOK XI.,"When you begin to kick and cuff,"
13808,BOOK XI.,You know not when you've done enough.
13809,BOOK XI.,Yet even there I came i' th' nick
13810,BOOK XI.,To lend the last a hearty kick:
13811,BOOK XI.,"Smite both my eyes! I scorn to puff,"
13812,BOOK XI.,But here 'twas I that work'd their buff!
13813,BOOK XI.,"On my strong toe this fray depended,"
13814,BOOK XI.,"Nestor began, and Nestor ended."
13815,BOOK XI.,"Our parsons then, to crown this job,"
13816,BOOK XI.,Order'd long prayers to hum the mob
13817,BOOK XI.,"At Pyle; where the folks, d'ye see,"
13818,BOOK XI.,"Thank'd Madam Pallas first, then me."
13819,BOOK XI.,"Thus, when a cub, my blood took fire,"
13820,BOOK XI.,And made me box it for my shire:
13821,BOOK XI.,The passion of this chum of yours
13822,BOOK XI.,Has kick'd his reason out of doors;
13823,BOOK XI.,"When they have sent us to the devil,"
13824,BOOK XI.,"Who values then his being civil,"
13825,BOOK XI.,Unless the bully will agree
13826,BOOK XI.,To hang himself for company?
13827,BOOK XI.,"The day I ever shall remember,"
13828,BOOK XI.,"I think 'twas some time in December,"
13829,BOOK XI.,"And blow'd a mack'rel gale, when we"
13830,BOOK XI.,To muster soldiers put to sea;
13831,BOOK XI.,I and Ulysses landed where
13832,BOOK XI.,His father kept the Old Black Bear;
13833,BOOK XI.,"We found him with his handmaid Nelly,"
13834,BOOK XI.,Preparing timber for the belly.
13835,BOOK XI.,"A bull upon a spit he puts,"
13836,BOOK XI.,And gave to whoring Jove the guts.
13837,BOOK XI.,Thy good old dad and thee were turning
13838,BOOK XI.,"The spit, to keep the fineat from burning"
13839,BOOK XI.,"Achilles help'd to bear a bob,"
13840,BOOK XI.,For troth it was a warmish job;
13841,BOOK XI.,"He was the first of all to 'spy us,"
13842,BOOK XI.,"And made a leg as he came nigh us,"
13843,BOOK XI.,"Told us, if we would pick a bit,"
13844,BOOK XI.,He'd cut a slice from off the spit.
13845,BOOK XI.,We neither of us were so nice
13846,BOOK XI.,As stay to be entreated twice:
13847,BOOK XI.,After twelve pots were fairly out
13848,BOOK XI.,We mentioned what we came about.
13849,BOOK XI.,"Strong beer will oft make men, you know,"
13850,BOOK XI.,As loving as a Trinculo;
13851,BOOK XI.,"'Twas so with you two bucks, you kiss'd us,"
13852,BOOK XI.,And swore by Jove you would assist us:
13853,BOOK XI.,Your dads spoke words worth tons of gold;
13854,BOOK XI.,"Old Peleus said, My son, be bold!"
13855,BOOK XI.,I've heard a fellow talk an hour
13856,BOOK XI.,"In Stephen's chapel, yet I'm sure,"
13857,BOOK XI.,"Nay, on occasion I would swear it,"
13858,BOOK XI.,"He did not say so much, or near it."
13859,BOOK XI.,Your father's speech was rather longer;
13860,BOOK XI.,"Quoth he, Though Peleus' son be stronger,"
13861,BOOK XI.,"And for his mother had a witch,"
13862,BOOK XI.,Yet when upon too high a pitch
13863,BOOK XI.,"He raves and swears, mind you and cool him,"
13864,BOOK XI.,And then you easily may rule him.
13865,BOOK XI.,"Thus spake your dad; but you, I find,"
13866,BOOK XI.,"Have quite forgot, or else don't mind:"
13867,BOOK XI.,"Though, if you will but try, you may"
13868,BOOK XI.,(A will can always find a way)
13869,BOOK XI.,"Persuade him to assist us now,"
13870,BOOK XI.,I  know he'll do a deal for you:
13871,BOOK XI.,"But if some fortune-telling witch,"
13872,BOOK XI.,"Some long-chinn'd, long-nos'd, ugly bitch"
13873,BOOK XI.,"Of Mother Shipton's breed, has made"
13874,BOOK XI.,"His mighty heart and pluck afraid,"
13875,BOOK XI.,"Tell him, Troy's rogues will change their note,"
13876,BOOK XI.,If he'll but lend you his great coat.
13877,BOOK XI.,"Put on his bear-skin coat, and meet 'em,"
13878,BOOK XI.,"If they don't run, by G-- I'll eat 'em;"
13879,BOOK XI.,"Back to their village will they scamper,"
13880,BOOK XI.,Nor longer thus our Grecians hamper;
13881,BOOK XI.,"Each man his own dear self will mind most,"
13882,BOOK XI.,And bid the devil take the hindmost.
13883,BOOK XI.,
13884,BOOK XI.,"At hearing of this doleful ditty,"
13885,BOOK XI.,"The bold Thessalian, touch'd with pity,"
13886,BOOK XI.,"Like a lamp-lighter, o'er the plain"
13887,BOOK XI.,Ran back with all his might and main.
13888,BOOK XI.,"It happen'd, as he cross'd a place"
13889,BOOK XI.,"Where Cox, a justice of the peace,"
13890,BOOK XI.,Was sending little whores to jail
13891,BOOK XI.,"For want of pence as well as bail,"
13892,BOOK XI.,"Just where Ulysses' cock-boats lay,"
13893,BOOK XI.,"From whence, a very little way,"
13894,BOOK XI.,"Their jolly parsons us'd to pray,"
13895,BOOK XI.,"Eurypylus he chanc'd to 'spy,"
13896,BOOK XI.,"As the great chief came hopping by,"
13897,BOOK XI.,"With a sad prick upon his thigh,"
13898,BOOK XI.,"Which gave the Greek such grievous pain,"
13899,BOOK XI.,It made him sweat and smoke again:
13900,BOOK XI.,"But I would have understood,"
13901,BOOK XI.,"Though he look'd blue, his heart was good."
13902,BOOK XI.,"Patroclus could not help from crying,"
13903,BOOK XI.,"To see him limp along; when, sighing,"
13904,BOOK XI.,"He thus begins: Now, by my soul,"
13905,BOOK XI.,You've got into a damn'd bad hole!
13906,BOOK XI.,"In an ill day ye sure set out,"
13907,BOOK XI.,To get so drubb'd and kick'd about.
13908,BOOK XI.,"But say, my friend, how matters stand;"
13909,BOOK XI.,"Doth Hector hold his heavy hand,"
13910,BOOK XI.,"Or still bestir his wooden sabre,"
13911,BOOK XI.,And all your backs and sides belabour?
13912,BOOK XI.,
13913,BOOK XI.,"The chief replies, and faintly reels,"
13914,BOOK XI.,This day shall Greece kick up her heels;
13915,BOOK XI.,"Greece, like Britannia, ends her glories,"
13916,BOOK XI.,And loyal whigs give way to tories;
13917,BOOK XI.,"The hearts of oak that led us on,"
13918,BOOK XI.,"All black and blue on board are gone,"
13919,BOOK XI.,Where Hector in the shape of Ch-t-am
13920,BOOK XI.,Swears by his crutches he'll be at 'em
13921,BOOK XI.,"Rather than disoblige L--d B--,"
13922,BOOK XI.,"He took an oath last night he'd do't,"
13923,BOOK XI.,"In spite of conscience, pox, or gout."
13924,BOOK XI.,"But I could wish that you, my friend,"
13925,BOOK XI.,At this sore pinch a hand would lend
13926,BOOK XI.,To find the point of this curs'd arrow!
13927,BOOK XI.,"But borrow first the butcher's barrow,"
13928,BOOK XI.,"And wheel me to my lodgings, where"
13929,BOOK XI.,"I've got all sorts of quack'ry gear,"
13930,BOOK XI.,And ev'ry kind of ointment which
13931,BOOK XI.,"Are good for scabs, or burns, or itch--"
13932,BOOK XI.,"You best know what, because they say"
13933,BOOK XI.,"You serv'd three years to Surgeon Gray,"
13934,BOOK XI.,And then thought fit to run away.
13935,BOOK XI.,"Surgeons of note we have but two,"
13936,BOOK XI.,And one is boxing hard just now;
13937,BOOK XI.,"The other, by the Trojan rout,"
13938,BOOK XI.,Has almost got his eyes knock'd out.
13939,BOOK XI.,
13940,BOOK XI.,"Patroclus thus replies: My friend,"
13941,BOOK XI.,"God knows where this strange work will end,"
13942,BOOK XI.,For ev'ry drunken rogue can splutter ill
13943,BOOK XI.,"'Bout Wilkes and Glynn, and Bute and Luttrell."
13944,BOOK XI.,"I  brought a message to our grandsire,"
13945,BOOK XI.,And was returning with his answer
13946,BOOK XI.,To great Achilles; but although
13947,BOOK XI.,"He's an impatient whelp, you know,"
13948,BOOK XI.,"Before I'll leave you in the mud,"
13949,BOOK XI.,I'll let him swear till swearing's good.
13950,BOOK XI.,
13951,BOOK XI.,"Then, though it made his sinews crack,"
13952,BOOK XI.,He took the bully on his back.
13953,BOOK XI.,"His handmaid 'spied him from the boats,"
13954,BOOK XI.,Riding just like a sack of oats:
13955,BOOK XI.,"Guessing he'd got a broken head,"
13956,BOOK XI.,"Or some d--d kick o' th' guts, she spread"
13957,BOOK XI.,An old cow's hide upon his bed.
13958,BOOK XI.,"Patroclus then, with very narrow"
13959,BOOK XI.,"Inspection, found the point o' th' arrow,"
13960,BOOK XI.,"Which he pull'd out as soon as found,"
13961,BOOK XI.,"And, making water in the wound,"
13962,BOOK XI.,"Wrapp'd an old clout, a little greasy,"
13963,BOOK XI.,"About the thigh, and left him easy."

14042,BOOK XII.,"On Childermas, a luckless day,"
14043,BOOK XII.,"Their shabby wall of mud, they say,"
14044,BOOK XII.,"Was rais'd, which made it soon give way."
14045,BOOK XII.,"But Homer had a better reason,"

14047,BOOK XII.,"They hurried so to get it up,"
14048,BOOK XII.,"They did not kill a single tup,"

14051,BOOK XII.,"This made their hungry parsons grumble,"
14052,BOOK XII.,And swear by G-d the wall would tumble;
14053,BOOK XII.,"And such a case, I'm pretty clear,"
14054,BOOK XII.,Would make a Christian parson swear--
14055,BOOK XII.,"When people cease their gods to serve,"
14056,BOOK XII.,The jolly priests of course must starve.
14057,BOOK XII.,For far less crimes the bulls of Rome
14058,BOOK XII.,Have kick'd and scar'd all Christendom;
14059,BOOK XII.,To every age and every station
14060,BOOK XII.,Roaring perdition and damnation;
14061,BOOK XII.,And had not one Sir Luther Martin

14071,BOOK XII.,"Why, reverend priests, you head of cod!"
14072,BOOK XII.,They are the journeymen of God:
14073,BOOK XII.,"And rare good journeymen they make,"
14074,BOOK XII.,All kinds of work they undertake;
14075,BOOK XII.,"For, be it spoken to their praise,"
14076,BOOK XII.,They'll do their duty twenty ways;
14077,BOOK XII.,"And, rather than they'll live in strife,"

14086,BOOK XII.,"And all the Grecian rogues forgotten,"

14088,BOOK XII.,To undermine these walls of mud:
14089,BOOK XII.,"Their names were Rhesus and Scamander,"
14090,BOOK XII.,On which swam many a goose and gander;
14091,BOOK XII.,"Æsepus and Heptaporus,"
14092,BOOK XII.,With Simois and Grenicus;
14093,BOOK XII.,"Caresus full of guts and blood,"
14094,BOOK XII.,And Rhesus black with kennel-mud:
14095,BOOK XII.,"They say, Apollo muster'd all"
14096,BOOK XII.,These streams to tumble down this wall;
14097,BOOK XII.,"And lest their labour should be vain,"
14098,BOOK XII.,Jove sent a thund'ring shower of rain;
14099,BOOK XII.,"Then Neptune seiz'd the time to work,"
14100,BOOK XII.,"And play'd the devil with his fork,"
14101,BOOK XII.,"Threw all the dirt about and sticks,"
14102,BOOK XII.,"Old broken pots, and ends of bricks;"
14103,BOOK XII.,"And, like our bumkins spreading dung,"
14104,BOOK XII.,The mud and stones about he flung

14106,BOOK XII.,As level as it was before;
14107,BOOK XII.,"(Which made th' next generation swear,"

14111,BOOK XII.,And now the rivers fac'd about
14112,BOOK XII.,To find their ancient currents out;
14113,BOOK XII.,"Some to cross vales and drain out bogs,"
14114,BOOK XII.,Others to wash the sties of hogs.

14116,BOOK XII.,As yet it stood secure and firm;
14117,BOOK XII.,"Nor had the Trojans done it hurt,"
14118,BOOK XII.,Though they kept pelting stones and dirt;
14119,BOOK XII.,And half the Greeks in woeful fright
14120,BOOK XII.,Durst not so much as tarry by't:
14121,BOOK XII.,"For, thinking Hector very soon"
14122,BOOK XII.,"Would knock their crazy bulwarks down,"
14123,BOOK XII.,"And, not content to overturn 'em,"
14124,BOOK XII.,"Go stave their rotten boats, or burn 'em,"
14125,BOOK XII.,The better half of these bold fighters
14126,BOOK XII.,Ran like bewitch'd to launch their lighters.
14127,BOOK XII.,For an excuse the cowards all
14128,BOOK XII.,Swore Jove had had so great a call
14129,BOOK XII.,"For courage all that week, his store"
14130,BOOK XII.,Could not produce a spoonful more
14131,BOOK XII.,"To help the luckless Greeks this bout,"
14132,BOOK XII.,And their own brandy-cask was out.
14133,BOOK XII.,"Pale Fear, when brandy did not back 'em,"
14134,BOOK XII.,Was always ready to attack 'em;
14135,BOOK XII.,"Which now she did in Hector's shape,"
14136,BOOK XII.,And made the varlets run and gape;
14137,BOOK XII.,"For, just as schoolboys kick a ball,"
14138,BOOK XII.,This furious Trojan kick'd 'em all:
14139,BOOK XII.,Like a mad ox[1] from Smithfield driven
14140,BOOK XII.,"By butchers' scoundrels, John and Stephen,"
14141,BOOK XII.,That gores and tosses in the air
14142,BOOK XII.,The blind and lame that can't get clear.
14143,BOOK XII.,"Thus ev'ry Greek that wanted cunning,"
14144,BOOK XII.,"Or heels to save himself by running,"
14145,BOOK XII.,"Hector belabour'd with his switch,"
14146,BOOK XII.,Or kick'd him quite across the ditch:
14147,BOOK XII.,But when the Trojans reach'd the side
14148,BOOK XII.,"Of this great ditch, full three feet wide,"
14149,BOOK XII.,It made a shift to stop their courses;
14150,BOOK XII.,Ditches won't do for carts and horses.
14151,BOOK XII.,
14152,BOOK XII.,The wise Polydamas soon saw
14153,BOOK XII.,"The cart-tits could no further go,"
14154,BOOK XII.,"So cock'd his mouth, and cry'd Halloo,"
14155,BOOK XII.,"Hip, brother Hector, hark, a word!"
14156,BOOK XII.,"This ditch will stop us, by the Lord!"
14157,BOOK XII.,"Unless with one consent we 'light,"
14158,BOOK XII.,And boldly march on foot to fight;
14159,BOOK XII.,"Therefore do you, and ev'ry friend"
14160,BOOK XII.,"That came a helping hand to lend,"
14161,BOOK XII.,To this my good advice attend:
14162,BOOK XII.,"Our tits can do no more, I think,"
14163,BOOK XII.,Than bring us to the very brink
14164,BOOK XII.,Where now we stand; but if we make 'em
14165,BOOK XII.,"Attempt to leap, 'tis odds we stake 'em"
14166,BOOK XII.,Upon a plaguy ugly row
14167,BOOK XII.,Of bakers' billets there below:
14168,BOOK XII.,"Besides, betwixt the ditch and wall"
14169,BOOK XII.,There is not room for carts and all.
14170,BOOK XII.,Though the great thund'rer Jove this bout
14171,BOOK XII.,"Has help'd the Trojans rarely out,"
14172,BOOK XII.,"And made the Grecians fight so tardy,"
14173,BOOK XII.,Don't let it make our nobs fool-hardy.
14174,BOOK XII.,"If he these varlets will demolish,"
14175,BOOK XII.,"And all their sweaty race abolish,"
14176,BOOK XII.,The only wish that I can lend 'em
14177,BOOK XII.,"Is, that he'll let the devil mend 'em:"
14178,BOOK XII.,But should they see us in this job
14179,BOOK XII.,"Crowded just like an English mob,"
14180,BOOK XII.,"Where we can neither fight nor run,"
14181,BOOK XII.,They'd smash us ev'ry mother's son;
14182,BOOK XII.,Nor would the rogues one Trojan spare
14183,BOOK XII.,To tell the world what fools we were.
14184,BOOK XII.,"Then gape with great attention, pray,"
14185,BOOK XII.,And swallow ev'ry word I say.
14186,BOOK XII.,"We must, to make these rascals mind us,"
14187,BOOK XII.,Send all our nags and carts behind us:
14188,BOOK XII.,"When Hector leads us on a-foot,"
14189,BOOK XII.,The odds are six to one we do't:
14190,BOOK XII.,"This is the only way to get 'em,"
14191,BOOK XII.,"And this good day, please God, we'll sweat 'em."
14192,BOOK XII.,
14193,BOOK XII.,Hector was pleas'd within his heart
14194,BOOK XII.,"With this advice; so left his cart,"
14195,BOOK XII.,"Jump'd on the ground with such a bang,"
14196,BOOK XII.,It made his metal buttons twang;
14197,BOOK XII.,"Which when the other bloods did see,"
14198,BOOK XII.,"They all jump'd down as well as he,"
14199,BOOK XII.,"And bid their drunken carters file off,"
14200,BOOK XII.,And wait i' th' rear about a mile off;
14201,BOOK XII.,Then into five good sturdy packs
14202,BOOK XII.,Divided all their bully backs.
14203,BOOK XII.,"The first, a race of bucks to stand by,"
14204,BOOK XII.,"Were headed by the Trojan Granby,"
14205,BOOK XII.,Call'd Hector in the Greek; he was
14206,BOOK XII.,"Assisted by Polydamas,"
14207,BOOK XII.,"And bold Cebriones, a wight"
14208,BOOK XII.,Could drive a cart as well as fight.
14209,BOOK XII.,"The second, and a sturdy band,"
14210,BOOK XII.,The whoring Paris did command:
14211,BOOK XII.,"Alcathous lent this varlet help,"
14212,BOOK XII.,And bold Agenor join'd the whelp.
14213,BOOK XII.,"The third obey'd two sons of Priam,"
14214,BOOK XII.,Fellows almost as tall as I am;
14215,BOOK XII.,"Deiphobus, a mighty Sir,"
14216,BOOK XII.,"And Helenus, a conjurer;"
14217,BOOK XII.,"To whom was added Asius,"
14218,BOOK XII.,A fiery buck from Hyrtacus;
14219,BOOK XII.,"His geldings were a yellow dun,"
14220,BOOK XII.,But better cart-tits never run.
14221,BOOK XII.,"Antenor's sons the fourth obey'd,"
14222,BOOK XII.,Join'd with that presbyterian blade
14223,BOOK XII.,"Pious Æneas*, who, they say,"
14224,BOOK XII.,Could stoutly box as well as pray;
14225,BOOK XII.,"Which none will wonder at, that hears"
14226,BOOK XII.,"He serv'd Old Noll in all his wars,"
14227,BOOK XII.,"Whose rogues, unlike our modern dull dogs,"
14228,BOOK XII.,"Could pray like saints, and fight like bull-dogs."
14229,BOOK XII.,The last tough band was drove with speed on
14230,BOOK XII.,"By a bold fellow call'd Sarpedon,"
14231,BOOK XII.,"A Lycian country 'squire, whose hounds"
14232,BOOK XII.,"Had almost eaten up his grounds,"
14233,BOOK XII.,"Which made him venture in this fray,"
14234,BOOK XII.,"Like some of our militia,"
14235,BOOK XII.,To box for honour and for pay.
14236,BOOK XII.,"Glaucus did help to guide this crew,"
14237,BOOK XII.,And bold Asteropæus too--
14238,BOOK XII.,"Two bucks as bold as bold could be,"
14239,BOOK XII.,But he was boldest of the three.
14240,BOOK XII.,"Each hardy Trojan, as he goes,"
14241,BOOK XII.,"Holds up his pot-lid o'er his nose,"
14242,BOOK XII.,For fear he might in this tough bout
14243,BOOK XII.,Get one or both his eyes knock'd out.
14244,BOOK XII.,"Thus they proceed through mud and mire,"
14245,BOOK XII.,Spurr'd onward with a keen desire
14246,BOOK XII.,To set the Grecian boats on fire;
14247,BOOK XII.,Certain their hopes will now be crown'd
14248,BOOK XII.,To see the scoundrels burnt or drown'd.
14249,BOOK XII.,
14250,BOOK XII.,"Whilst thus the Trojans, sans delay,"
14251,BOOK XII.,"Their leader's good advice obey,"
14252,BOOK XII.,"The huff-bluff Asius kept his dray,"
14253,BOOK XII.,"And drove his tits along the plain,"
14254,BOOK XII.,But never brought 'em back again.
14255,BOOK XII.,No more this giddy headstrong boy
14256,BOOK XII.,Je-up'd his yellow duns to Troy;
14257,BOOK XII.,"But, when he reach'd the other side,"
14258,BOOK XII.,Idomeneus drubb'd his hide.
14259,BOOK XII.,"Now to the left he smok'd along,"
14260,BOOK XII.,Amidst a motley Grecian throng
14261,BOOK XII.,"Of rogues, that made confounded skips"
14262,BOOK XII.,To reach their rotten boats and ships:
14263,BOOK XII.,"None look behind to help their mates,"
14264,BOOK XII.,But dart like lightning through the gates.
14265,BOOK XII.,As rabbits pop into their holes
14266,BOOK XII.,"When dogs disturb 'em, so in shoals"
14267,BOOK XII.,"The Greeks forsook each brake and thicket,"
14268,BOOK XII.,And popp'd their noddles through the wicket:
14269,BOOK XII.,"When they were there, the better half"
14270,BOOK XII.,Could hardly think they yet were safe.
14271,BOOK XII.,Thither this hair-brain'd hero flew
14272,BOOK XII.,"With his mad, roaring, ranting crew,"
14273,BOOK XII.,"In wondrous hopes the Greeks to souse,"
14274,BOOK XII.,Hopes that turn'd out not worth a louse.
14275,BOOK XII.,"Two bloods sprang up to guard the gates,"
14276,BOOK XII.,"With brawny backs, and bomb-proof pates."
14277,BOOK XII.,"Since to relate their names it meet is,"
14278,BOOK XII.,I'll do't: The first was Polypœtes;
14279,BOOK XII.,"Pirithous us'd to trim his mother,"
14280,BOOK XII.,And got him; but who got the other
14281,BOOK XII.,"I  can't assert, or when or where:"
14282,BOOK XII.,"That he was got is pretty clear,"
14283,BOOK XII.,"And christen'd too, because his dad"
14284,BOOK XII.,Call'd him Leontius when a lad:
14285,BOOK XII.,"Both from the Lapith race did spring,"
14286,BOOK XII.,Bold rogues as ever stretch'd a string.
14287,BOOK XII.,"Like two thick posts of oak or fir,"
14288,BOOK XII.,That neither carts nor drays can stir
14289,BOOK XII.,(Though drunken draymen drive their dray
14290,BOOK XII.,"Against them forty times a day),"
14291,BOOK XII.,So firmly stood before the gates
14292,BOOK XII.,"This pair of bloods with wooden pates,"
14293,BOOK XII.,Nor car'd a straw what Asius' crew
14294,BOOK XII.,"Of roaring, noisy whelps could do;"
14295,BOOK XII.,Though in his front Orestes was
14296,BOOK XII.,Join'd with a buck call'd Acamas;
14297,BOOK XII.,And Onomaus did appear
14298,BOOK XII.,With serjeant Thoon in the rear.
14299,BOOK XII.,But all the airs that they could put on
14300,BOOK XII.,Did hardly signify a button.
14301,BOOK XII.,"They made a dreadful hubble bubble,"
14302,BOOK XII.,But got their labour for their trouble.
14303,BOOK XII.,"The besom-shafts that hit the gates,"
14304,BOOK XII.,"And those that hit these fellows' pates,"
14305,BOOK XII.,"Bounc'd with the very self-same sound,"
14306,BOOK XII.,From gates and pates upon the ground;
14307,BOOK XII.,Which proves that both were sure enough
14308,BOOK XII.,Made of the self-same kind of stuff.
14309,BOOK XII.,"But still these Lapiths fight and bawl,"
14310,BOOK XII.,And on the Grecian blackguards call:
14311,BOOK XII.,"Yet though they saw the rascals run,"
14312,BOOK XII.,"As English guards by chance have done,"
14313,BOOK XII.,"They ventur'd by themselves to stay,"
14314,BOOK XII.,"Nor would they stir an inch, not they."
14315,BOOK XII.,
14316,BOOK XII.,"[Illustration: Book XII, page 399."
14317,BOOK XII.,Now whilst the Greeks possession keep
14318,BOOK XII.,"O' th' walls, they box it ancle-deep,"
14319,BOOK XII.,To save their rotten boats and lighters--
14320,BOOK XII.,The Devil never saw such fighters.]
14321,BOOK XII.,
14322,BOOK XII.,"Like Amadis de Gaul, these elves"
14323,BOOK XII.,Fac'd a whole army by themselves.
14324,BOOK XII.,Thus have I seen in bushy grounds
14325,BOOK XII.,"Two badgers fight a pack of hounds,"
14326,BOOK XII.,"Bite to the bone each forward whelp,"
14327,BOOK XII.,And make the puppies run and yelp:
14328,BOOK XII.,"So these two bucks maintain the battle,"
14329,BOOK XII.,Though broomstaves made their noddles rattle.
14330,BOOK XII.,
14331,BOOK XII.,Now whilst the Greeks possession keep
14332,BOOK XII.,"O' th' walls, they box it ancle-deep"
14333,BOOK XII.,To save their rotten boats and lighters--
14334,BOOK XII.,The devil never saw such fighters.
14335,BOOK XII.,"As when a keen north wind doth blow,"
14336,BOOK XII.,"And brings along both sleet and snow,"
14337,BOOK XII.,"You cannot see, so fast it snows,"
14338,BOOK XII.,Above a yard before your nose:
14339,BOOK XII.,"As thick as this, or very nigh,"
14340,BOOK XII.,"Brickbats and stones and broomshafts fly,"
14341,BOOK XII.,"Spring from their buff-skins with a bound,"
14342,BOOK XII.,And hollow pates and potlids sound.
14343,BOOK XII.,"When Asius found his labour lost,"
14344,BOOK XII.,"To make these hangdogs quit their post,"
14345,BOOK XII.,"Nor stir an inch, do all he could,"
14346,BOOK XII.,He then began to damn his blood;
14347,BOOK XII.,"And in a furious passion cries,"
14348,BOOK XII.,Not me but Jove himself tells lies!
14349,BOOK XII.,"Else we should long ago have sous'd 'em,"
14350,BOOK XII.,"And either in the salt-sea dows'd 'em,"
14351,BOOK XII.,"Or fir'd their boats and sing'd the dogs,"
14352,BOOK XII.,As city butchers singe their hogs.
14353,BOOK XII.,"But like a swarm of wasps hard prest,"
14354,BOOK XII.,"That gather thick to guard their nest,"
14355,BOOK XII.,"Like them, this spiteful Grecian fry"
14356,BOOK XII.,"Kick, scratch, and bite, and sting, and die."
14357,BOOK XII.,"But what most frets my guts and gall,"
14358,BOOK XII.,Two thick-skull'd scoundrels stop us all;
14359,BOOK XII.,'Tis easier far to break the gates
14360,BOOK XII.,Than either of these rascals' pates.
14361,BOOK XII.,
14362,BOOK XII.,"Whilst thus he fum'd as if he'd split,"
14363,BOOK XII.,"Jove did not mind his noise a bit,"
14364,BOOK XII.,"But sat consid'ring with great care,"
14365,BOOK XII.,How all the glory he could spare
14366,BOOK XII.,Might fall to honest Hector's share.
14367,BOOK XII.,Like a poor taylor pinch'd for cloth
14368,BOOK XII.,"To make a suit, yet very loth"
14369,BOOK XII.,"To give it up, and leave undone"
14370,BOOK XII.,A job he'd set his heart upon;
14371,BOOK XII.,"So Jove, who promis'd Troy he'd let 'em"
14372,BOOK XII.,"Kick all the Greeks about, and sweat 'em,"
14373,BOOK XII.,Was rather puzzled how he might
14374,BOOK XII.,"Manage this hubble-bubble fight,"
14375,BOOK XII.,And not destroy the Grecians quite.
14376,BOOK XII.,"But yet he swears, though hard put to't"
14377,BOOK XII.,"(Like Snip the taylor with his suit),"
14378,BOOK XII.,He'd find some way to piece it out.
14379,BOOK XII.,
14380,BOOK XII.,"The Trojans tried the other gates,"
14381,BOOK XII.,And in return got broken pates;
14382,BOOK XII.,"Nor was that all, for show'rs of stones"
14383,BOOK XII.,"The foremost hit, and brake their bones."
14384,BOOK XII.,O Butler's spirit! help me out
14385,BOOK XII.,To sing each deed and hero stout;
14386,BOOK XII.,"How Greece, like battle-royal cocks,"
14387,BOOK XII.,"Both gave and took most bloody knocks,"
14388,BOOK XII.,"Whilst all the gods, for whom these sinners"
14389,BOOK XII.,"Had often cook'd up handsome dinners,"
14390,BOOK XII.,Durst neither wag a hand or foot
14391,BOOK XII.,To help their crony Grecians out--
14392,BOOK XII.,Not but they long'd to join the riot;
14393,BOOK XII.,Jove made the rogues and jades be quiet.
14394,BOOK XII.,"But though the Grecian gods were civil,"
14395,BOOK XII.,"Yet, by th' assistance of the devil,"
14396,BOOK XII.,"Or some old Scots or Lapland witches,"
14397,BOOK XII.,This pair of thick-skull'd sons of bitches
14398,BOOK XII.,"In mighty wrath kept boxing on,"
14399,BOOK XII.,And knock'd the foremost Trojans down.
14400,BOOK XII.,"One Damasus, a bully rock,"
14401,BOOK XII.,A fellow that would nim a smock
14402,BOOK XII.,"From off a hedge if it was loose,"
14403,BOOK XII.,"Or steal a barn-door fowl or goose,"
14404,BOOK XII.,"From Polypœtes got a pat,"
14405,BOOK XII.,That knock'd his brains out through his hat;
14406,BOOK XII.,"Then Ormenus he tumbled down,"
14407,BOOK XII.,"And crack'd poor Peter Pylon's crown,"
14408,BOOK XII.,An honest soul that kept a pot-house
14409,BOOK XII.,A little way from Greening's hot-house.
14410,BOOK XII.,"Leonteus then began to stickle,"
14411,BOOK XII.,And laid Hippolachus in pickle
14412,BOOK XII.,"He kept, before the Trojan war,"
14413,BOOK XII.,An oilman's shop near Temple-bar.
14414,BOOK XII.,"Next way'd his quarter-staff, and soon"
14415,BOOK XII.,"A buckle-maker of renown,"
14416,BOOK XII.,"Antiphates, came rumbling down:"
14417,BOOK XII.,"Just as he stepp'd from out the ranks,"
14418,BOOK XII.,He reach'd his legs and broke his shanks.
14419,BOOK XII.,"Iamenus, a great hot-presser,"
14420,BOOK XII.,"With Menon too, a leather-dresser;"
14421,BOOK XII.,"He nick'd them as full butt they came on,"
14422,BOOK XII.,"And in his passion laid a lame on,"
14423,BOOK XII.,"By which the first got finely press'd,"
14424,BOOK XII.,And t'other had his skin well dress'd.
14425,BOOK XII.,"Orestes last, a country put,"
14426,BOOK XII.,"Got such a cursed knock o' th' gut,"
14427,BOOK XII.,"It made him gape so wide, the swain"
14428,BOOK XII.,Could never shut his mouth again.
14429,BOOK XII.,
14430,BOOK XII.,Now Hector and Polydamas
14431,BOOK XII.,"Were cuffing at another pass,"
14432,BOOK XII.,Back'd by a blust'ring Trojan crew
14433,BOOK XII.,"Of fellows pick'd, and all true blue,"
14434,BOOK XII.,"Resolv'd to fire the Grecian fleet,"
14435,BOOK XII.,And Hector just stark mad to see't;
14436,BOOK XII.,"When, lo! i' th' midst of all the fight,"
14437,BOOK XII.,A most uncommon dreadful sight
14438,BOOK XII.,"Did all their high-flown courage cool,"
14439,BOOK XII.,And almost brought 'em to a stool:
14440,BOOK XII.,"A heron, going out to steal"
14441,BOOK XII.,"Some fish for breakfast, caught an eel,"
14442,BOOK XII.,"Which he soon gobbled down to fill him,"
14443,BOOK XII.,But did not take much time to kill him;
14444,BOOK XII.,On which the eel made such a rout
14445,BOOK XII.,"Within his gut, he let him out,"
14446,BOOK XII.,Just at the very time he flew
14447,BOOK XII.,"Over this noisy, roaring crew."
14448,BOOK XII.,But the poor heron scream'd so loud
14449,BOOK XII.,"To lose his breakfast, all the crowd"
14450,BOOK XII.,"Whipp'd up their eyes to look, and soon"
14451,BOOK XII.,They saw the eel come wriggling down:
14452,BOOK XII.,"The dreadful sight amaz'd 'em so,"
14453,BOOK XII.,You might have fell'd 'em with a straw.
14454,BOOK XII.,The wise Polydamas we find
14455,BOOK XII.,"Rumbled this matter in his mind,"
14456,BOOK XII.,But could not from his gizzard pluck
14457,BOOK XII.,"The eel, it in his stomach stuck;"
14458,BOOK XII.,On which he with a sapient look
14459,BOOK XII.,Thus to his brother Hector spoke:
14460,BOOK XII.,
14461,BOOK XII.,"Brother, says he, you often swear"
14462,BOOK XII.,When you my faithful counsel hear;
14463,BOOK XII.,"And though I speak but what I think,"
14464,BOOK XII.,You like a heathen damn and sink;
14465,BOOK XII.,"But I'm a Trojan, and shan't cease"
14466,BOOK XII.,To speak my mind in war or peace;
14467,BOOK XII.,"All Englishmen that do so now,"
14468,BOOK XII.,The people call them Trojans true.
14469,BOOK XII.,"Then take my counsel, if you choose it;"
14470,BOOK XII.,"If not, you're welcome to refuse it:"
14471,BOOK XII.,"'Tis for your credit what I say,"
14472,BOOK XII.,"For you command, and I obey;"
14473,BOOK XII.,This day depend you'll never do't
14474,BOOK XII.,(Don't swear till you have heard me out);
14475,BOOK XII.,The truth I never will conceal;
14476,BOOK XII.,"This long-legg'd bird that sh-- the eel,"
14477,BOOK XII.,Jove sent just now to let us know
14478,BOOK XII.,How matters with ourselves will go.
14479,BOOK XII.,"The bird had gobbled up his prey,"
14480,BOOK XII.,But could not carry it away.
14481,BOOK XII.,"Thus will it fare with us, depend on't:"
14482,BOOK XII.,"I'm sure it will, so mark the end on't:"
14483,BOOK XII.,"For though we tumble down the wall,"
14484,BOOK XII.,"And fire their rotten boats and all,"
14485,BOOK XII.,"I'll eat my hat, if Jove don't drop us,"
14486,BOOK XII.,Or play some queer rogue's trick to stop us.
14487,BOOK XII.,"This by my second-sight I know,"
14488,BOOK XII.,And Endor's witch will tell you so;
14489,BOOK XII.,"Or if she won't, by holy Paul,"
14490,BOOK XII.,I'll make her conjure up king Saul!
14491,BOOK XII.,
14492,BOOK XII.,Hector replies in sober sadness:
14493,BOOK XII.,You'd make a man eat hay for madness;
14494,BOOK XII.,"Blast your long jaws, you conj'ring knave,"
14495,BOOK XII.,Is this the best advice you have?
14496,BOOK XII.,"You know much better things, I'm clear,"
14497,BOOK XII.,But dare not speak your mind for fear.
14498,BOOK XII.,"Did not Jove send down Madam Iris,"
14499,BOOK XII.,"The rainbow wench, whose tail on fire is,"
14500,BOOK XII.,To tell us we their bones should thwack?
14501,BOOK XII.,Then who the devil would turn back?
14502,BOOK XII.,Did not his rusty bomb-shell roll
14503,BOOK XII.,Till it half crack'd his mustard-bowl;
14504,BOOK XII.,"And all the noise was to the right,"
14505,BOOK XII.,Only to egg us on to fight?
14506,BOOK XII.,"And think you I'll such orders slight,"
14507,BOOK XII.,"Or let a slipp'ry eel, God wot,"
14508,BOOK XII.,Tell me if I shall fight or not?
14509,BOOK XII.,I own I may a motion feel
14510,BOOK XII.,To eat a slice of collar'd eel;
14511,BOOK XII.,"But eels can never, I've a notion,"
14512,BOOK XII.,"Make Hector feel a running motion,"
14513,BOOK XII.,"Unless they make his bowels loose,"
14514,BOOK XII.,Then make him run to th' little house.
14515,BOOK XII.,"A brave man waves his cudgel high,"
14516,BOOK XII.,"Asking no witch the reason why,"
14517,BOOK XII.,But for his country's cause ding-dong
14518,BOOK XII.,Lets fly his broomstick right or wrong:
14519,BOOK XII.,"For thy part, I am pretty sure;"
14520,BOOK XII.,Let who will fall thou'lt sleep secure;
14521,BOOK XII.,"When all thy friends by scores are dropping,"
14522,BOOK XII.,Thou'lt find some dirty hole to pop in;
14523,BOOK XII.,"And, in the steps of Paris treading,"
14524,BOOK XII.,Secure a hole to put your head in.
14525,BOOK XII.,But if a single Trojan follows
14526,BOOK XII.,"Such rogues' examples, by Apollo's"
14527,BOOK XII.,Red fiery whiskers I shall soon
14528,BOOK XII.,Be up with you and crack your crown!
14529,BOOK XII.,"I'll keep this broomstick ready for you,"
14530,BOOK XII.,"So mind your hits, look sharp and stir you."
14531,BOOK XII.,
14532,BOOK XII.,"At this he ran, and made a halloo"
14533,BOOK XII.,For all his ragged rogues to follow.
14534,BOOK XII.,"These trusty Trojans, one and all,"
14535,BOOK XII.,Obey their roaring leader's call;
14536,BOOK XII.,"Like him they run, and roar, and shout,"
14537,BOOK XII.,And make their broomsticks fly about
14538,BOOK XII.,"Then Jove from Ida sent a gust,"
14539,BOOK XII.,And blinded all the Greeks with dust--
14540,BOOK XII.,A stratagem he just then thought on
14541,BOOK XII.,Would greatly help this Trojan Broughton.
14542,BOOK XII.,"Thus back'd by Jove, these roysters batter"
14543,BOOK XII.,"The walls and gates with dreadful clatter,"
14544,BOOK XII.,"Pull up the stakes that fence the wall,"
14545,BOOK XII.,And down the dirt and pebbles fall.
14546,BOOK XII.,But still the half-blind Grecians yet
14547,BOOK XII.,"Battled as high as they could get,"
14548,BOOK XII.,And sent a nimble-footed swain
14549,BOOK XII.,To beg the tanners in Long-lane.
14550,BOOK XII.,"Would lend them all their hides in hair,"
14551,BOOK XII.,"And tann'd ones too, that they could spare,"
14552,BOOK XII.,With horns and hoofs; all which they laid
14553,BOOK XII.,To stop the gaps that Hector made;
14554,BOOK XII.,"Then close and box it tooth and nail,"
14555,BOOK XII.,Whilst horns and broomsticks fly like hail.
14556,BOOK XII.,
14557,BOOK XII.,"The two Ajaces stirr'd their stumps,"
14558,BOOK XII.,"And, whilst they deal most bitter thumps"
14559,BOOK XII.,"Amongst the Trojans, were not slack"
14560,BOOK XII.,To clap their comrades on the back.
14561,BOOK XII.,The brave recover'd soon their fright
14562,BOOK XII.,But rogues they kick'd to make 'em fight;
14563,BOOK XII.,Whilst one employ'd both foot and hand
14564,BOOK XII.,"In drubbing rogues that durst not stand,"
14565,BOOK XII.,"The other spoke these words, or near it--"
14566,BOOK XII.,And no bad speech but you shall hear it:
14567,BOOK XII.,
14568,BOOK XII.,"Ye Grecians, who at country fairs"
14569,BOOK XII.,"Have shown yourselves good cudgel-players,"
14570,BOOK XII.,By which you've got both hats and fame--
14571,BOOK XII.,And ye who hope to do the same--
14572,BOOK XII.,"Though ev'ry man can't box his two,"
14573,BOOK XII.,Yet something ev'ry man may do;
14574,BOOK XII.,"The strong, good sturdy thumps may deal"
14575,BOOK XII.,"To make yon scoundrel Trojans feel,"
14576,BOOK XII.,"And roar as loud as they, and louder;"
14577,BOOK XII.,The weak will make good food for powder.
14578,BOOK XII.,A day is come when great and small
14579,BOOK XII.,"Must look out sharp; there's work for all,"
14580,BOOK XII.,And ev'ry buck that is but bold
14581,BOOK XII.,"May gain new fame, or splice the old,"
14582,BOOK XII.,"Hearten the valiant on, and stop"
14583,BOOK XII.,The sneaking rogues that give it up.
14584,BOOK XII.,"Then tune your rusty windpipes all,"
14585,BOOK XII.,And roar as loud as you can bawl;
14586,BOOK XII.,"For though we yield to Troy in whoring,"
14587,BOOK XII.,We sure can match the dogs in roaring:
14588,BOOK XII.,"Thus, if Jove pleases, we once more"
14589,BOOK XII.,May drub 'em as we've done before.
14590,BOOK XII.,
14591,BOOK XII.,"This speech reviv'd their courage so,"
14592,BOOK XII.,That showers of broken pots they throw.
14593,BOOK XII.,Have you not seen a sodomite
14594,BOOK XII.,Advanc'd a very proper height
14595,BOOK XII.,"Upon a rare machine, which we,"
14596,BOOK XII.,"The vulgar, call a pillory?"
14597,BOOK XII.,So fast and thick the crowd below
14598,BOOK XII.,"Their rotten eggs and dung bestow,"
14599,BOOK XII.,"You see, in less than half an hour,"
14600,BOOK XII.,The rogue and pillory cover'd o'er:
14601,BOOK XII.,So fast did broken pots and stones
14602,BOOK XII.,Fly down to break the Trojans' bones.
14603,BOOK XII.,
14604,BOOK XII.,"Now Hector and his bucks did strive,"
14605,BOOK XII.,The gates from off the hooks to drive:
14606,BOOK XII.,"But did not gain of ground one inch,"
14607,BOOK XII.,Nor would the purblind Grecians flinch.
14608,BOOK XII.,"Jove quickly saw some help they'd need on,"
14609,BOOK XII.,"So sent his bastard, bold Sarpedon,"
14610,BOOK XII.,"And blew his courage up so high,"
14611,BOOK XII.,"He did not seem to walk, but fly;"
14612,BOOK XII.,"A greasy leather coat he wore,"
14613,BOOK XII.,And high in air his pot-lid bore;
14614,BOOK XII.,"A mighty furious targe it was,"
14615,BOOK XII.,Made of a cow-skin tipp'd with brass.
14616,BOOK XII.,"He shook two broomstaves thick and strong,"
14617,BOOK XII.,And frowning lugg'd his knaves along.
14618,BOOK XII.,"Thus have I seen an ill-look'd thief,"
14619,BOOK XII.,"By sailors call'd a press-gang chief,"
14620,BOOK XII.,"Look fierce though by a mob pursu'd,"
14621,BOOK XII.,And ston'd and hiss'd at by the crowd;
14622,BOOK XII.,"Yet, spite of all the distant war,"
14623,BOOK XII.,"Seizes some helpless, friendless tar:"
14624,BOOK XII.,Just so this roaring blade Sarpedon
14625,BOOK XII.,"His Lycian shirtless rogues did lead on,"
14626,BOOK XII.,"Darting such looks against the wall,"
14627,BOOK XII.,As if he'd eat it stones and all;
14628,BOOK XII.,"Then squinting at his trusty friend,"
14629,BOOK XII.,"Who always did his steps attend,"
14630,BOOK XII.,"Thus speaks: I'm sore afraid, friend Glaucus,"
14631,BOOK XII.,That all the neighbourhood will joke us.
14632,BOOK XII.,"What boots it then to have it said,"
14633,BOOK XII.,"That we chief constables are made,"
14634,BOOK XII.,"And therefore with churchwardens dine,"
14635,BOOK XII.,"Where we drink beer, and punch, and wine,"
14636,BOOK XII.,"Free gratis[2], whilst poor rascals gape,"
14637,BOOK XII.,And as we pass 'em bow and scrape?
14638,BOOK XII.,"What signifies these honours, if"
14639,BOOK XII.,We don't exceed these raff and riff
14640,BOOK XII.,"As much, or rather more, in fighting,"
14641,BOOK XII.,"Than either reading well or writing,"
14642,BOOK XII.,Making the thick-skull'd varlets stare
14643,BOOK XII.,"To see us buy our posts so dear,"
14644,BOOK XII.,And own we've earn'd by toil and sweat
14645,BOOK XII.,More pudding than we e'er shall get?
14646,BOOK XII.,"Then will each cry, Such folks may be"
14647,BOOK XII.,"Chief constables, or lords, for me."
14648,BOOK XII.,"Could all our cares but save our breath,"
14649,BOOK XII.,"Or ward a broken pate from death,"
14650,BOOK XII.,I  would not ask my friend to fight;
14651,BOOK XII.,More might be lost than gotten by't.
14652,BOOK XII.,"But since grim Death will, soon or late,"
14653,BOOK XII.,"Lend us a swingeing knock o' th' pate,"
14654,BOOK XII.,"Whether, when once the fray's begun,"
14655,BOOK XII.,"We stay to box it out or run,"
14656,BOOK XII.,"And Old Age, with his grizzle' locks,"
14657,BOOK XII.,"Add gouty pains t' our half-curd pox,"
14658,BOOK XII.,"The life that brandy, whores, and claps"
14659,BOOK XII.,"Will help old Time to steal by scraps,"
14660,BOOK XII.,"Let's boldly risque; that people may,"
14661,BOOK XII.,"Whene'er our names are mention'd, say,"
14662,BOOK XII.,"With one consent, both young and old,"
14663,BOOK XII.,These honest souls are hearts of gold.
14664,BOOK XII.,
14665,BOOK XII.,"The speech was hardly clos'd, when this chief"
14666,BOOK XII.,Found his friend ready cock'd for mischief;
14667,BOOK XII.,"The Lycians shake their staves, and follow"
14668,BOOK XII.,Their leaders with a whoop and halloo.
14669,BOOK XII.,"As they mov'd forward, Peteus' son"
14670,BOOK XII.,"Look'd sharp, and saw them coming on;"
14671,BOOK XII.,"Which put him in so great a fright,"
14672,BOOK XII.,"His long lank hair stood bolt upright,"
14673,BOOK XII.,And in his weem he felt a motion
14674,BOOK XII.,As if he'd ta'en a purging potion;
14675,BOOK XII.,"But what was worst, he hardly felt it"
14676,BOOK XII.,"Above a moment, ere he smelt it:"
14677,BOOK XII.,On which he peep'd about to spy
14678,BOOK XII.,If any trusty Greeks were nigh--
14679,BOOK XII.,When to his joy he saw the places
14680,BOOK XII.,"Where Teucer stood with both th' Ajaces,"
14681,BOOK XII.,Fighting like devils on a row;
14682,BOOK XII.,"To whom he roars, So-ho, So-ho!"
14683,BOOK XII.,But might as well have say'd his wind
14684,BOOK XII.,To cool his pottage; for we find
14685,BOOK XII.,The clatt'ring cudgels make such noise
14686,BOOK XII.,"As would have drown'd old Stentor's voice,"
14687,BOOK XII.,"Full on the walls their broomstaves bump,"
14688,BOOK XII.,"And on the gates their brickbats thump,"
14689,BOOK XII.,"Making such fearful din and rout,"
14690,BOOK XII.,Jove's thunder seem'd but farting to't.
14691,BOOK XII.,When thus Menestheus speaks to Thoos;
14692,BOOK XII.,"Those Lycian rogues to hell will blow us,"
14693,BOOK XII.,"If you don't run and tell th' Ajaces,"
14694,BOOK XII.,How lamentably bad our case is;
14695,BOOK XII.,"Urge them to scamper to our aid,"
14696,BOOK XII.,"For, o' my soul, I'm sore afraid"
14697,BOOK XII.,Of that same roaring Lycian blade.
14698,BOOK XII.,"Say from yourself, Pray, how the pox"
14699,BOOK XII.,"Can he defend his sentry-box,"
14700,BOOK XII.,"And, all alone, make good his quarters"
14701,BOOK XII.,'Gainst such a host of Lycian Tartars?
14702,BOOK XII.,"But if hard switch'd themselves they are,"
14703,BOOK XII.,"Beg they will bully Ajax spare,"
14704,BOOK XII.,"Along with serjeant Teucer, who"
14705,BOOK XII.,Can do good bus'ness with his bow.
14706,BOOK XII.,
14707,BOOK XII.,"Away he starts, and like a man"
14708,BOOK XII.,Through all the crowd the beadle ran;
14709,BOOK XII.,He found the bullies on the plain
14710,BOOK XII.,Boxing it till they smok'd again:
14711,BOOK XII.,"To whom he cries, Whilst here you fight"
14712,BOOK XII.,"With riff-raff rogues from morn to night,"
14713,BOOK XII.,"Menestheus, in a sad condition,"
14714,BOOK XII.,"Has sent me humbly to petition,"
14715,BOOK XII.,That some of you great heroes stout
14716,BOOK XII.,Will come with me and help him out;
14717,BOOK XII.,For two great Lycian bullies now
14718,BOOK XII.,Threaten to thrash him black and blue:
14719,BOOK XII.,"But adds, if on this dang'rous pinch"
14720,BOOK XII.,"You seem afraid these buffs will flinch,"
14721,BOOK XII.,"He humbly hopes great Ajax, you Sir,"
14722,BOOK XII.,Will come along with serjeant Teucer.
14723,BOOK XII.,
14724,BOOK XII.,At this great Ajax faced about
14725,BOOK XII.,To go himself and help him out;
14726,BOOK XII.,"But though he was no friend to jawing,"
14727,BOOK XII.,"And knew 'twas time he should be going,"
14728,BOOK XII.,He thought it proper now to say
14729,BOOK XII.,Something before he march'd away:
14730,BOOK XII.,"Brave Lycomede, and you Oileus,"
14731,BOOK XII.,"Says he, look sharp, and you shall see us"
14732,BOOK XII.,"Go drub yon lousy rogues, and then"
14733,BOOK XII.,We'll in a twink be back again;
14734,BOOK XII.,"But take great care you both stand fast,"
14735,BOOK XII.,And battle till your broomsticks last;
14736,BOOK XII.,"For, if you let your courage fail ye,"
14737,BOOK XII.,Depend these Trojan whelps will nail ye!
14738,BOOK XII.,"Then call'd Pandion, Hark ye, you Sir,"
14739,BOOK XII.,Come here and take this bow for Teucer:
14740,BOOK XII.,Since Hector gave him such a fell blow
14741,BOOK XII.,"Upon his stomach and his elbow,"
14742,BOOK XII.,The harmless lad can scarce with ease
14743,BOOK XII.,Lug his own share of bread and cheese.
14744,BOOK XII.,Then with long strides the thick-legg'd elf
14745,BOOK XII.,Carried his potlid and himself.
14746,BOOK XII.,"Next Teucer after him did go,"
14747,BOOK XII.,And then Pandion with the bow.
14748,BOOK XII.,
14749,BOOK XII.,Now on the wall the Lycians lower
14750,BOOK XII.,Like a black heavy thunder shower;
14751,BOOK XII.,"The Greeks, though mighty weak i' the joints,"
14752,BOOK XII.,"Receive 'em on their broomstick points,"
14753,BOOK XII.,"Renew the fray with double force,"
14754,BOOK XII.,And roar till they're with roaring hoarse;
14755,BOOK XII.,And 'midst their bawling and their hissing
14756,BOOK XII.,"They cried, to keep themselves from p--g;"
14757,BOOK XII.,"Finding their water would come out,"
14758,BOOK XII.,"They thought it best, without dispute,"
14759,BOOK XII.,"Rather than wet both breeks and thighs,"
14760,BOOK XII.,To let it bubble--through their eyes.
14761,BOOK XII.,
14762,BOOK XII.,"Whilst thus they scuffle, Ajax soon"
14763,BOOK XII.,"Came up, and fetch'd Epicles down,"
14764,BOOK XII.,"A bottle friend of this Sarpedon,"
14765,BOOK XII.,And one that he had often need on;
14766,BOOK XII.,"Because like him no man, 'tis said,"
14767,BOOK XII.,Could ferret out a maidenhead:
14768,BOOK XII.,"By which you see he was an imp,"
14769,BOOK XII.,By honest people call'd a pimp;
14770,BOOK XII.,"But royal pimps despise disgrace,"
14771,BOOK XII.,"Because they're sure to get a place,"
14772,BOOK XII.,"Though their own sisters they should dish up,"
14773,BOOK XII.,And then stand pimp like scoundrel B-----.
14774,BOOK XII.,
14775,BOOK XII.,"The clumsy Greek had pois'd his stick,"
14776,BOOK XII.,When he espy'd a double brick
14777,BOOK XII.,Had tumbled from the wall: not two
14778,BOOK XII.,Of our poor dogs could throw it now;
14779,BOOK XII.,Nor even with both hands could raise
14780,BOOK XII.,(They made large bricks in former days):
14781,BOOK XII.,"He swung it round, away it fled"
14782,BOOK XII.,"Ten yards above the Lycian's head,"
14783,BOOK XII.,"Then fell upon the varlet's crown,"
14784,BOOK XII.,And with a rattle brought him down.
14785,BOOK XII.,Have you not seen the yonkers make
14786,BOOK XII.,A diving-match upon the lake?
14787,BOOK XII.,"Halfpence are to the bottom thrown,"
14788,BOOK XII.,Which he that fetches calls his own;
14789,BOOK XII.,"And that they may the deeper sink,"
14790,BOOK XII.,Pop from the trees that shade the brink:
14791,BOOK XII.,"Thus did the luckless Lycian fall,"
14792,BOOK XII.,And nimbly div'd from off the wall;
14793,BOOK XII.,But did not when he touch'd the plain
14794,BOOK XII.,So nimbly find his legs again.
14795,BOOK XII.,"Glaucus was lugging at a stick,"
14796,BOOK XII.,When Teucer gave his arm a prick;
14797,BOOK XII.,But as he knew his varlets would
14798,BOOK XII.,"All scamper, if they saw his blood,"
14799,BOOK XII.,"He took good care to hide the gap,"
14800,BOOK XII.,And whipp'd it under his coat lap;
14801,BOOK XII.,"Then finding he must leave the fray,"
14802,BOOK XII.,"Like an old fox he stole away,"
14803,BOOK XII.,"Sarpedon saw, and angry grew"
14804,BOOK XII.,To lose his pimp and bully too;
14805,BOOK XII.,"But his great fury to engage,"
14806,BOOK XII.,"Soon made him turn his grief to rage,"
14807,BOOK XII.,He seiz'd that time his staff to lay on
14808,BOOK XII.,"A harmless Grecian call'd Alcmaon,"
14809,BOOK XII.,"A commissary's clerk, no fighter,"
14810,BOOK XII.,But an accountant and a writer:
14811,BOOK XII.,Instant a bloody riv'let flows
14812,BOOK XII.,"From the unlucky varlet's nose,"
14813,BOOK XII.,"And as upon the grass he tumbled,"
14814,BOOK XII.,His inkhorn 'gainst his ruler rumbled.
14815,BOOK XII.,"Sudden the wall the conqu'ror shakes,"
14816,BOOK XII.,And pulls up all the hedging-stakes:
14817,BOOK XII.,"With such a force he shook, that soon"
14818,BOOK XII.,"Rubbish by pecks came tumbling down,"
14819,BOOK XII.,And made a gap as large and wide
14820,BOOK XII.,"As Madame ***'s, that would, if tried,"
14821,BOOK XII.,"Admit in any kind of weather,"
14822,BOOK XII.,Two troopers on abreast together.
14823,BOOK XII.,"At this bold Teucer twang'd his bow,"
14824,BOOK XII.,And Ajax let a broomshaft go;
14825,BOOK XII.,"The arrow stuck upon his belt,"
14826,BOOK XII.,The besom-shaft his potlid felt:
14827,BOOK XII.,"But though with rage the stick was cast hard,"
14828,BOOK XII.,Jove swore it should not hurt his bastard.
14829,BOOK XII.,"Howe'er, his fury did not slack,"
14830,BOOK XII.,"Although he drew a little back,"
14831,BOOK XII.,"Not with design to run, but that"
14832,BOOK XII.,He might repay them tit for tat.
14833,BOOK XII.,Loud as a bell in Stepney steeple
14834,BOOK XII.,He thus encouraged all his people:
14835,BOOK XII.,
14836,BOOK XII.,"Lycians, who feast on cakes and ale,"
14837,BOOK XII.,"Let not your noble courage fail,"
14838,BOOK XII.,Else Trojans will be apt to think
14839,BOOK XII.,Soup meagre's been your meat and drink.
14840,BOOK XII.,You see with many a bitter rap
14841,BOOK XII.,"I've made at last a handsome gap,"
14842,BOOK XII.,"But I shall never gain the top,"
14843,BOOK XII.,Unless you help to shove me up;
14844,BOOK XII.,"Therefore let's join our jowls together,"
14845,BOOK XII.,And pelt 'em spite of wind and weather.
14846,BOOK XII.,
14847,BOOK XII.,"The Lycians heard this speech, and slap"
14848,BOOK XII.,They ran like smoke to reach the gap.
14849,BOOK XII.,"The Greeks stood stiffly, and as soon"
14850,BOOK XII.,As they came up they knock'd 'em down;
14851,BOOK XII.,"Nor did the Lycians, though so stout,"
14852,BOOK XII.,"Force in, or yet be quite kept out."
14853,BOOK XII.,Thus have I seen within a college
14854,BOOK XII.,Two learned owls of little knowledge
14855,BOOK XII.,"Dispute for hours, and, when they'd done,"
14856,BOOK XII.,Leave off as wise as they begun;
14857,BOOK XII.,Nor would they in the annual round
14858,BOOK XII.,Obtain or lose one inch of ground;
14859,BOOK XII.,"For, you'll observe, a learned tup,"
14860,BOOK XII.,"Though wrong, will never give it up."
14861,BOOK XII.,Just such a stubborn bout this was
14862,BOOK XII.,To gain or lose the dusty pass.
14863,BOOK XII.,"Many bold Trojans ribs were smack'd,"
14864,BOOK XII.,And many a Grecian's noddle crack'd;
14865,BOOK XII.,"Whilst many a nose ran down with blood,"
14866,BOOK XII.,And soak'd these dusty walls of mud.
14867,BOOK XII.,Under the Privy-garden wall
14868,BOOK XII.,Two cupboard-doors compose a stall;
14869,BOOK XII.,Here you may see old Moggy Briggs
14870,BOOK XII.,With caution weigh her rotten figs;
14871,BOOK XII.,"No cast o' th' scale she gives the boys,"
14872,BOOK XII.,But sells her ware on equal poise:
14873,BOOK XII.,"Thus neither Greece nor Troy prevails,"
14874,BOOK XII.,"But stand like Moggy's rusty scales,"
14875,BOOK XII.,"Till bully Hector thund'ring came,"
14876,BOOK XII.,And threw his weight upon the beam;
14877,BOOK XII.,"Mad as a bull he scales the walls,"
14878,BOOK XII.,And for his trusty Trojans calls;
14879,BOOK XII.,"Come here, and bring each man a match,"
14880,BOOK XII.,"And we'll the lucky moment catch,"
14881,BOOK XII.,"And then, depend on't, in a twinkum,"
14882,BOOK XII.,We'll either burn their boats or sink 'em.
14883,BOOK XII.,
14884,BOOK XII.,"His voice once heard, these Trojan fighters"
14885,BOOK XII.,Bring out their link-boys and lamplighters;
14886,BOOK XII.,Not one of all the ragged pack
14887,BOOK XII.,"But lugg'd a ladder on his back,"
14888,BOOK XII.,Which they against the hedgestakes prop.
14889,BOOK XII.,And in a moment reach the top.
14890,BOOK XII.,"Straight on the walls, the Greeks to fright,"
14891,BOOK XII.,Appear'd to their astonish'd sight
14892,BOOK XII.,A fearful and amazing light:
14893,BOOK XII.,Their small remains of courage sinks
14894,BOOK XII.,To see such shoals of lamps and links.
14895,BOOK XII.,Then Hector snatch'd up such a stone
14896,BOOK XII.,As Brandy Nanny stands upon
14897,BOOK XII.,"In Paul's church-yard; it weigh'd, I guess,"
14898,BOOK XII.,"'Bout half a ton, or more or less;"
14899,BOOK XII.,"Ten porters, strong as can be found,"
14900,BOOK XII.,Would hardly lift it from the ground
14901,BOOK XII.,"(In these our days of sloth and ease,"
14902,BOOK XII.,When porters work just as they please):
14903,BOOK XII.,Yet this as easily he flung
14904,BOOK XII.,As I could do a dried neat's tongue.
14905,BOOK XII.,"But Jove himself, you'll understand,"
14906,BOOK XII.,Lent him a sort of helping hand:
14907,BOOK XII.,And in these days great Jove could do
14908,BOOK XII.,As much as popish saints can now.
14909,BOOK XII.,"Thus arm'd, he ran t' attack the gates,"
14910,BOOK XII.,Though rivetted with iron plates:
14911,BOOK XII.,"Nestor, who, when the commonweal"
14912,BOOK XII.,"Requir'd his help, could gravely steal"
14913,BOOK XII.,"(A trade that soldiers quickly learn),"
14914,BOOK XII.,"Had stole 'em from a farmer's barn,"
14915,BOOK XII.,"Then drove 'em thick with heads of nails,"
14916,BOOK XII.,"Such as you see in country jails,"
14917,BOOK XII.,Where nails are driven all about
14918,BOOK XII.,To hinder thieves from stealing out:
14919,BOOK XII.,"These gates, though stronger gates could not"
14920,BOOK XII.,"At such a time of need be got,"
14921,BOOK XII.,Were quite unable to resist
14922,BOOK XII.,This weighty stone and mutton fist:
14923,BOOK XII.,
14924,BOOK XII.,"[Illustration: Book XII, page 431."
14925,BOOK XII.,"These gates, though stronger gates could not"
14926,BOOK XII.,"At such a time of need be got,"
14927,BOOK XII.,Were quite unable to resist
14928,BOOK XII.,This weighty stone and mutton fist.]
14929,BOOK XII.,
14930,BOOK XII.,With wondrous force he drove it through
14931,BOOK XII.,"The plank, and broke the bars in two;"
14932,BOOK XII.,"In twenty thousand splinters shatter'd,"
14933,BOOK XII.,The farmer's rotten gates lay scatter'd.
14934,BOOK XII.,"But what completed all the jumble,"
14935,BOOK XII.,One gate from off the hinge did tumble.
14936,BOOK XII.,"Then Hector roar'd, Have at your pates!"
14937,BOOK XII.,And darted headlong through the gates:
14938,BOOK XII.,"In either hand he shook a stick,"
14939,BOOK XII.,And look'd as if he'd eat 'em quick:
14940,BOOK XII.,"For strength of fists and breadth of back,"
14941,BOOK XII.,He beat the giant-killer Jack;
14942,BOOK XII.,"And, moving with resistless force,"
14943,BOOK XII.,Seem'd an o'ermatch for man and horse.
14944,BOOK XII.,"The Trojans, with a dismal yell,"
14945,BOOK XII.,"Follow'd their thund'ring chief pell-mell,"
14946,BOOK XII.,"Whilst the poor Grecians all let fly,"
14947,BOOK XII.,And ran to wipe their breeches dry.
14948,BOOK XII.,
14949,BOOK XII.,
14950,BOOK XII.,
14951,BOOK XII.,"[1] I have heard this evil would long ago have been put a stop to, and"
14952,BOOK XII.,beasts not suffered to be driven through the city; but it was
14953,BOOK XII.,apprehended it would breed great confusion to take the freedom of the
14954,BOOK XII.,city from horned cattle.
14955,BOOK XII.,
14956,BOOK XII.,[2] Free gratis.--The common people always put these two words together.
