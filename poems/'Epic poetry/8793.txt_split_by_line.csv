37,CANTO XIX,"It was the hour, when of diurnal heat"
38,CANTO XIX,"No reliques chafe the cold beams of the moon,"
39,CANTO XIX,"O'erpower'd by earth, or planetary sway"
40,CANTO XIX,Of Saturn; and the geomancer sees
41,CANTO XIX,"His Greater Fortune up the east ascend,"
42,CANTO XIX,Where gray dawn checkers first the shadowy cone;
43,CANTO XIX,When 'fore me in my dream a woman's shape
44,CANTO XIX,"There came, with lips that stammer'd, eyes aslant,"
45,CANTO XIX,"Distorted feet, hands maim'd, and colour pale."
46,CANTO XIX,
47,CANTO XIX,I look'd upon her; and as sunshine cheers
48,CANTO XIX,"Limbs numb'd by nightly cold, e'en thus my look"
49,CANTO XIX,"Unloos'd her tongue, next in brief space her form"
50,CANTO XIX,"Decrepit rais'd erect, and faded face"
51,CANTO XIX,With love's own hue illum'd. Recov'ring speech
52,CANTO XIX,"She forthwith warbling such a strain began,"
53,CANTO XIX,"That I, how loth soe'er, could scarce have held"
54,CANTO XIX,"Attention from the song.  ""I,"" thus she sang,"
55,CANTO XIX,"""I am the Siren, she, whom mariners"
56,CANTO XIX,On the wide sea are wilder'd when they hear:
57,CANTO XIX,Such fulness of delight the list'ner feels.
58,CANTO XIX,I from his course Ulysses by my lay
59,CANTO XIX,Enchanted drew.  Whoe'er frequents me once
60,CANTO XIX,"Parts seldom; so I charm him, and his heart"
61,CANTO XIX,"Contented knows no void.""  Or ere her mouth"
62,CANTO XIX,"Was clos'd, to shame her at her side appear'd"
63,CANTO XIX,A dame of semblance holy.  With stern voice
64,CANTO XIX,"She utter'd; ""Say, O Virgil, who is this?"""
65,CANTO XIX,"Which hearing, he approach'd, with eyes still bent"
66,CANTO XIX,"Toward that goodly presence: th' other seiz'd her,"
67,CANTO XIX,"And, her robes tearing, open'd her before,"
68,CANTO XIX,"And show'd the belly to me, whence a smell,"
69,CANTO XIX,"Exhaling loathsome, wak'd me.  Round I turn'd"
70,CANTO XIX,"Mine eyes, and thus the teacher: ""At the least"
71,CANTO XIX,"Three times my voice hath call'd thee.  Rise, begone."
72,CANTO XIX,"Let us the opening find where thou mayst pass."""
73,CANTO XIX,
74,CANTO XIX,"I straightway rose.  Now day, pour'd down from high,"
75,CANTO XIX,Fill'd all the circuits of the sacred mount;
76,CANTO XIX,"And, as we journey'd, on our shoulder smote"
77,CANTO XIX,"The early ray.  I follow'd, stooping low"
78,CANTO XIX,"My forehead, as a man, o'ercharg'd with thought,"
79,CANTO XIX,"Who bends him to the likeness of an arch,"
80,CANTO XIX,"That midway spans the flood; when thus I heard,"
81,CANTO XIX,"""Come, enter here,"" in tone so soft and mild,"
82,CANTO XIX,As never met the ear on mortal strand.
83,CANTO XIX,
84,CANTO XIX,"With swan-like wings dispread and pointing up,"
85,CANTO XIX,"Who thus had spoken marshal'd us along,"
86,CANTO XIX,Where each side of the solid masonry
87,CANTO XIX,"The sloping, walls retir'd; then mov'd his plumes,"
88,CANTO XIX,"And fanning us, affirm'd that those, who mourn,"
89,CANTO XIX,"Are blessed, for that comfort shall be theirs."
90,CANTO XIX,
91,CANTO XIX,"""What aileth thee, that still thou look'st to earth?"""
92,CANTO XIX,Began my leader; while th' angelic shape
93,CANTO XIX,A little over us his station took.
94,CANTO XIX,
95,CANTO XIX,"""New vision,"" I replied, ""hath rais'd in me"
96,CANTO XIX,"Surmisings strange and anxious doubts, whereon"
97,CANTO XIX,My soul intent allows no other thought
98,CANTO XIX,"Or room or entrance.""--""Hast thou seen,"" said he,"
99,CANTO XIX,"""That old enchantress, her, whose wiles alone"
100,CANTO XIX,The spirits o'er us weep for?  Hast thou seen
101,CANTO XIX,How man may free him of her bonds?  Enough.
102,CANTO XIX,"Let thy heels spurn the earth, and thy rais'd ken"
103,CANTO XIX,"Fix on the lure, which heav'n's eternal King"
104,CANTO XIX,"Whirls in the rolling spheres.""  As on his feet"
105,CANTO XIX,"The falcon first looks down, then to the sky"
106,CANTO XIX,"Turns, and forth stretches eager for the food,"
107,CANTO XIX,"That woos him thither; so the call I heard,"
108,CANTO XIX,"So onward, far as the dividing rock"
109,CANTO XIX,"Gave way, I journey'd, till the plain was reach'd."
110,CANTO XIX,
111,CANTO XIX,"On the fifth circle when I stood at large,"
112,CANTO XIX,"A race appear'd before me, on the ground"
113,CANTO XIX,All downward lying prone and weeping sore.
114,CANTO XIX,"""My soul hath cleaved to the dust,"" I heard"
115,CANTO XIX,"With sighs so deep, they well nigh choak'd the words."
116,CANTO XIX,"""O ye elect of God, whose penal woes"
117,CANTO XIX,"Both hope and justice mitigate, direct"
118,CANTO XIX,"Tow'rds the steep rising our uncertain way."""
119,CANTO XIX,
120,CANTO XIX,"""If ye approach secure from this our doom,"
121,CANTO XIX,"Prostration--and would urge your course with speed,"
122,CANTO XIX,"See that ye still to rightward keep the brink."""
123,CANTO XIX,
124,CANTO XIX,"So them the bard besought; and such the words,"
125,CANTO XIX,"Beyond us some short space, in answer came."
126,CANTO XIX,
127,CANTO XIX,I noted what remain'd yet hidden from them:
128,CANTO XIX,"Thence to my liege's eyes mine eyes I bent,"
129,CANTO XIX,"And he, forthwith interpreting their suit,"
130,CANTO XIX,"Beckon'd his glad assent. Free then to act,"
131,CANTO XIX,"As pleas'd me, I drew near, and took my stand"
132,CANTO XIX,"O`er that shade, whose words I late had mark'd."
133,CANTO XIX,"And, ""Spirit!""  I said, ""in whom repentant tears"
134,CANTO XIX,"Mature that blessed hour, when thou with God"
135,CANTO XIX,"Shalt find acceptance, for a while suspend"
136,CANTO XIX,"For me that mightier care.  Say who thou wast,"
137,CANTO XIX,"Why thus ye grovel on your bellies prone,"
138,CANTO XIX,"And if in aught ye wish my service there,"
139,CANTO XIX,"Whence living I am come.""  He answering spake"
140,CANTO XIX,"""The cause why Heav'n our back toward his cope"
141,CANTO XIX,"Reverses, shalt thou know: but me know first"
142,CANTO XIX,"The successor of Peter, and the name"
143,CANTO XIX,"And title of my lineage from that stream,"
144,CANTO XIX,That' twixt Chiaveri and Siestri draws
145,CANTO XIX,His limpid waters through the lowly glen.
146,CANTO XIX,"A month and little more by proof I learnt,"
147,CANTO XIX,With what a weight that robe of sov'reignty
148,CANTO XIX,"Upon his shoulder rests, who from the mire"
149,CANTO XIX,Would guard it: that each other fardel seems
150,CANTO XIX,"But feathers in the balance.  Late, alas!"
151,CANTO XIX,Was my conversion: but when I became
152,CANTO XIX,"Rome's pastor, I discern'd at once the dream"
153,CANTO XIX,"And cozenage of life, saw that the heart"
154,CANTO XIX,"Rested not there, and yet no prouder height"
155,CANTO XIX,"Lur'd on the climber: wherefore, of that life"
156,CANTO XIX,"No more enamour'd, in my bosom love"
157,CANTO XIX,Of purer being kindled.  For till then
158,CANTO XIX,"I was a soul in misery, alienate"
159,CANTO XIX,"From God, and covetous of all earthly things;"
160,CANTO XIX,"Now, as thou seest, here punish'd for my doting."
161,CANTO XIX,Such cleansing from the taint of avarice
162,CANTO XIX,Do spirits converted need.  This mount inflicts
163,CANTO XIX,No direr penalty.  E'en as our eyes
164,CANTO XIX,"Fasten'd below, nor e'er to loftier clime"
165,CANTO XIX,"Were lifted, thus hath justice level'd us"
166,CANTO XIX,Here on the earth.  As avarice quench'd our love
167,CANTO XIX,"Of good, without which is no working, thus"
168,CANTO XIX,"Here justice holds us prison'd, hand and foot"
169,CANTO XIX,"Chain'd down and bound, while heaven's just Lord shall please."
170,CANTO XIX,"So long to tarry motionless outstretch'd."""
171,CANTO XIX,
172,CANTO XIX,"My knees I stoop'd, and would have spoke; but he,"
173,CANTO XIX,"Ere my beginning, by his ear perceiv'd"
174,CANTO XIX,"I did him reverence; and ""What cause,"" said he,"
175,CANTO XIX,"""Hath bow'd thee thus!""--""Compunction,"" I rejoin'd."
176,CANTO XIX,"""And inward awe of your high dignity."""
177,CANTO XIX,
178,CANTO XIX,"""Up,"" he exclaim'd, ""brother! upon thy feet"
179,CANTO XIX,"Arise: err not: thy fellow servant I,"
180,CANTO XIX,(Thine and all others') of one Sovran Power.
181,CANTO XIX,If thou hast ever mark'd those holy sounds
182,CANTO XIX,"Of gospel truth, 'nor shall be given ill marriage,'"
183,CANTO XIX,Thou mayst discern the reasons of my speech.
184,CANTO XIX,Go thy ways now; and linger here no more.
185,CANTO XIX,"Thy tarrying is a let unto the tears,"
186,CANTO XIX,With which I hasten that whereof thou spak'st.
187,CANTO XIX,I have on earth a kinswoman; her name
188,CANTO XIX,"Alagia, worthy in herself, so ill"
189,CANTO XIX,Example of our house corrupt her not:
190,CANTO XIX,"And she is all remaineth of me there."""

195,CANTO XX,CANTO XX
196,CANTO XX,
197,CANTO XX,"Ill strives the will, 'gainst will more wise that strives"
198,CANTO XX,"His pleasure therefore to mine own preferr'd,"
199,CANTO XX,I drew the sponge yet thirsty from the wave.
200,CANTO XX,
201,CANTO XX,"Onward I mov'd: he also onward mov'd,"
202,CANTO XX,"Who led me, coasting still, wherever place"
203,CANTO XX,"Along the rock was vacant, as a man"
204,CANTO XX,Walks near the battlements on narrow wall.
205,CANTO XX,"For those on th' other part, who drop by drop"
206,CANTO XX,"Wring out their all-infecting malady,"
207,CANTO XX,Too closely press the verge.  Accurst be thou!
208,CANTO XX,"Inveterate wolf! whose gorge ingluts more prey,"
209,CANTO XX,"Than every beast beside, yet is not fill'd!"
210,CANTO XX,So bottomless thy maw!--Ye spheres of heaven!
211,CANTO XX,"To whom there are, as seems, who attribute"
212,CANTO XX,"All change in mortal state, when is the day"
213,CANTO XX,"Of his appearing, for whom fate reserves"
214,CANTO XX,To chase her hence?--With wary steps and slow
215,CANTO XX,"We pass'd; and I attentive to the shades,"
216,CANTO XX,Whom piteously I heard lament and wail;
217,CANTO XX,
218,CANTO XX,"And, 'midst the wailing, one before us heard"
219,CANTO XX,"Cry out ""O blessed Virgin!""  as a dame"
220,CANTO XX,"In the sharp pangs of childbed; and ""How poor"
221,CANTO XX,"Thou wast,"" it added, ""witness that low roof"
222,CANTO XX,Where thou didst lay thy sacred burden down.
223,CANTO XX,O good Fabricius! thou didst virtue choose
224,CANTO XX,"With poverty, before great wealth with vice."""
225,CANTO XX,
226,CANTO XX,"The words so pleas'd me, that desire to know"
227,CANTO XX,"The spirit, from whose lip they seem'd to come,"
228,CANTO XX,Did draw me onward.  Yet it spake the gift
229,CANTO XX,"Of Nicholas, which on the maidens he"
230,CANTO XX,"Bounteous bestow'd, to save their youthful prime"
231,CANTO XX,"Unblemish'd.  ""Spirit! who dost speak of deeds"
232,CANTO XX,"So worthy, tell me who thou was,"" I said,"
233,CANTO XX,"""And why thou dost with single voice renew"
234,CANTO XX,Memorial of such praise. That boon vouchsaf'd
235,CANTO XX,Haply shall meet reward; if I return
236,CANTO XX,"To finish the Short pilgrimage of life,"
237,CANTO XX,"Still speeding to its close on restless wing."""
238,CANTO XX,
239,CANTO XX,"""I,"" answer'd he, ""will tell thee, not for hell,"
240,CANTO XX,Which thence I look for; but that in thyself
241,CANTO XX,"Grace so exceeding shines, before thy time"
242,CANTO XX,Of mortal dissolution.  I was root
243,CANTO XX,"Of that ill plant, whose shade such poison sheds"
244,CANTO XX,"O'er all the Christian land, that seldom thence"
245,CANTO XX,"Good fruit is gather'd.  Vengeance soon should come,"
246,CANTO XX,"Had Ghent and Douay, Lille and Bruges power;"
247,CANTO XX,And vengeance I of heav'n's great Judge implore.
248,CANTO XX,Hugh Capet was I high: from me descend
249,CANTO XX,"The Philips and the Louis, of whom France"
250,CANTO XX,"Newly is govern'd; born of one, who ply'd"
251,CANTO XX,The slaughterer's trade at Paris.  When the race
252,CANTO XX,Of ancient kings had vanish'd (all save one
253,CANTO XX,Wrapt up in sable weeds) within my gripe
254,CANTO XX,"I found the reins of empire, and such powers"
255,CANTO XX,"Of new acquirement, with full store of friends,"
256,CANTO XX,That soon the widow'd circlet of the crown
257,CANTO XX,"Was girt upon the temples of my son,"
258,CANTO XX,"He, from whose bones th' anointed race begins."
259,CANTO XX,Till the great dower of Provence had remov'd
260,CANTO XX,"The stains, that yet obscur'd our lowly blood,"
261,CANTO XX,"Its sway indeed was narrow, but howe'er"
262,CANTO XX,"It wrought no evil: there, with force and lies,"
263,CANTO XX,"Began its rapine; after, for amends,"
264,CANTO XX,"Poitou it seiz'd, Navarre and Gascony."
265,CANTO XX,"To Italy came Charles, and for amends"
266,CANTO XX,"Young Conradine an innocent victim slew,"
267,CANTO XX,"And sent th' angelic teacher back to heav'n,"
268,CANTO XX,"Still for amends.  I see the time at hand,"
269,CANTO XX,That forth from France invites another Charles
270,CANTO XX,To make himself and kindred better known.
271,CANTO XX,"Unarm'd he issues, saving with that lance,"
272,CANTO XX,Which the arch-traitor tilted with; and that
273,CANTO XX,"He carries with so home a thrust, as rives"
274,CANTO XX,The bowels of poor Florence.  No increase
275,CANTO XX,"Of territory hence, but sin and shame"
276,CANTO XX,"Shall be his guerdon, and so much the more"
277,CANTO XX,As he more lightly deems of such foul wrong.
278,CANTO XX,"I see the other, who a prisoner late"
279,CANTO XX,"Had steps on shore, exposing to the mart"
280,CANTO XX,"His daughter, whom he bargains for, as do"
281,CANTO XX,The Corsairs for their slaves.  O avarice!
282,CANTO XX,"What canst thou more, who hast subdued our blood"
283,CANTO XX,"So wholly to thyself, they feel no care"
284,CANTO XX,Of their own flesh?  To hide with direr guilt
285,CANTO XX,"Past ill and future, lo! the flower-de-luce"
286,CANTO XX,Enters Alagna! in his Vicar Christ
287,CANTO XX,"Himself a captive, and his mockery"
288,CANTO XX,Acted again!  Lo! to his holy lip
289,CANTO XX,The vinegar and gall once more applied!
290,CANTO XX,And he 'twixt living robbers doom'd to bleed!
291,CANTO XX,"Lo! the new Pilate, of whose cruelty"
292,CANTO XX,"Such violence cannot fill the measure up,"
293,CANTO XX,"With no degree to sanction, pushes on"
294,CANTO XX,Into the temple his yet eager sails!
295,CANTO XX,
296,CANTO XX,"""O sovran Master! when shall I rejoice"
297,CANTO XX,"To see the vengeance, which thy wrath well-pleas'd"
298,CANTO XX,"In secret silence broods?--While daylight lasts,"
299,CANTO XX,"So long what thou didst hear of her, sole spouse"
300,CANTO XX,"Of the Great Spirit, and on which thou turn'dst"
301,CANTO XX,"To me for comment, is the general theme"
302,CANTO XX,"Of all our prayers: but when it darkens, then"
303,CANTO XX,"A different strain we utter, then record"
304,CANTO XX,"Pygmalion, whom his gluttonous thirst of gold"
305,CANTO XX,"Made traitor, robber, parricide: the woes"
306,CANTO XX,"Of Midas, which his greedy wish ensued,"
307,CANTO XX,Mark'd for derision to all future times:
308,CANTO XX,"And the fond Achan, how he stole the prey,"
309,CANTO XX,That yet he seems by Joshua's ire pursued.
310,CANTO XX,"Sapphira with her husband next, we blame;"
311,CANTO XX,"And praise the forefeet, that with furious ramp"
312,CANTO XX,Spurn'd Heliodorus.  All the mountain round
313,CANTO XX,"Rings with the infamy of Thracia's king,"
314,CANTO XX,Who slew his Phrygian charge: and last a shout
315,CANTO XX,"Ascends: ""Declare, O Crassus! for thou know'st,"
316,CANTO XX,"The flavour of thy gold.""  The voice of each"
317,CANTO XX,"Now high now low, as each his impulse prompts,"
318,CANTO XX,"Is led through many a pitch, acute or grave."
319,CANTO XX,"Therefore, not singly, I erewhile rehears'd"
320,CANTO XX,That blessedness we tell of in the day:
321,CANTO XX,"But near me none beside his accent rais'd."""
322,CANTO XX,
323,CANTO XX,"From him we now had parted, and essay'd"
324,CANTO XX,"With utmost efforts to surmount the way,"
325,CANTO XX,"When I did feel, as nodding to its fall,"
326,CANTO XX,The mountain tremble; whence an icy chill
327,CANTO XX,"Seiz'd on me, as on one to death convey'd."
328,CANTO XX,"So shook not Delos, when Latona there"
329,CANTO XX,Couch'd to bring forth the twin-born eyes of heaven.
330,CANTO XX,
331,CANTO XX,Forthwith from every side a shout arose
332,CANTO XX,"So vehement, that suddenly my guide"
333,CANTO XX,"Drew near, and cried: ""Doubt not, while I conduct thee."""
334,CANTO XX,"""Glory!"" all shouted (such the sounds mine ear"
335,CANTO XX,"Gather'd from those, who near me swell'd the sounds)"
336,CANTO XX,"""Glory in the highest be to God.""  We stood"
337,CANTO XX,"Immovably suspended, like to those,"
338,CANTO XX,"The shepherds, who first heard in Bethlehem's field"
339,CANTO XX,"That song: till ceas'd the trembling, and the song"
340,CANTO XX,"Was ended: then our hallow'd path resum'd,"
341,CANTO XX,"Eying the prostrate shadows, who renew'd"
342,CANTO XX,Their custom'd mourning.  Never in my breast
343,CANTO XX,Did ignorance so struggle with desire
344,CANTO XX,"Of knowledge, if my memory do not err,"
345,CANTO XX,As in that moment; nor through haste dar'd I
346,CANTO XX,"To question, nor myself could aught discern,"
347,CANTO XX,So on I far'd in thoughtfulness and dread.
348,CANTO XX,
349,CANTO XX,
350,CANTO XX,
351,CANTO XX,
352,CANTO XXI,CANTO XXI
353,CANTO XXI,
354,CANTO XXI,"The natural thirst, ne'er quench'd but from the well,"
355,CANTO XXI,"Whereof the woman of Samaria crav'd,"
356,CANTO XXI,"Excited: haste along the cumber'd path,"
357,CANTO XXI,"After my guide, impell'd; and pity mov'd"
358,CANTO XXI,"My bosom for the 'vengeful deed, though just."
359,CANTO XXI,"When lo! even as Luke relates, that Christ"
360,CANTO XXI,"Appear'd unto the two upon their way,"
361,CANTO XXI,New-risen from his vaulted grave; to us
362,CANTO XXI,"A shade appear'd, and after us approach'd,"
363,CANTO XXI,Contemplating the crowd beneath its feet.
364,CANTO XXI,"We were not ware of it; so first it spake,"
365,CANTO XXI,"Saying, ""God give you peace, my brethren!"" then"
366,CANTO XXI,"Sudden we turn'd: and Virgil such salute,"
367,CANTO XXI,"As fitted that kind greeting, gave, and cried:"
368,CANTO XXI,"""Peace in the blessed council be thy lot"
369,CANTO XXI,"Awarded by that righteous court, which me"
370,CANTO XXI,"To everlasting banishment exiles!"""
371,CANTO XXI,
372,CANTO XXI,"""How!"" he exclaim'd, nor from his speed meanwhile"
373,CANTO XXI,"Desisting, ""If that ye be spirits, whom God"
374,CANTO XXI,"Vouchsafes not room above, who up the height"
375,CANTO XXI,"Has been thus far your guide?""  To whom the bard:"
376,CANTO XXI,"""If thou observe the tokens, which this man"
377,CANTO XXI,"Trac'd by the finger of the angel bears,"
378,CANTO XXI,'Tis plain that in the kingdom of the just
379,CANTO XXI,"He needs must share.  But sithence she, whose wheel"
380,CANTO XXI,"Spins day and night, for him not yet had drawn"
381,CANTO XXI,"That yarn, which, on the fatal distaff pil'd,"
382,CANTO XXI,"Clotho apportions to each wight that breathes,"
383,CANTO XXI,"His soul, that sister is to mine and thine,"
384,CANTO XXI,"Not of herself could mount, for not like ours"
385,CANTO XXI,"Her ken: whence I, from forth the ample gulf"
386,CANTO XXI,"Of hell was ta'en, to lead him, and will lead"
387,CANTO XXI,"Far as my lore avails.  But, if thou know,"
388,CANTO XXI,"Instruct us for what cause, the mount erewhile"
389,CANTO XXI,Thus shook and trembled: wherefore all at once
390,CANTO XXI,"Seem'd shouting, even from his wave-wash'd foot."""
391,CANTO XXI,
392,CANTO XXI,"That questioning so tallied with my wish,"
393,CANTO XXI,The thirst did feel abatement of its edge
394,CANTO XXI,"E'en from expectance.  He forthwith replied,"
395,CANTO XXI,"""In its devotion nought irregular"
396,CANTO XXI,"This mount can witness, or by punctual rule"
