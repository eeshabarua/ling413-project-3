126,PREFACE,Many able and cultured writers have delighted to expatiate on the
127,PREFACE,"beauties of Milton's 'Paradise Lost,' and to linger with admiration over"
128,PREFACE,the lofty utterances expressed in his poem. Though conscious of his
129,PREFACE,inability to do justice to the sublimest of poets and the noblest of
130,PREFACE,"sciences, the author has ventured to contribute to Miltonic literature a"
131,PREFACE,work which he hopes will prove to be of an interesting and instructive
132,PREFACE,character. Perhaps the choicest passages in the poem are associated with
133,PREFACE,"astronomical allusion, and it is chiefly to the exposition and"
134,PREFACE,illustration of these that this volume is devoted.
135,PREFACE,
136,PREFACE,"The writer is indebted to many authors for information and reference,"
137,PREFACE,"and especially to Miss Agnes M. Clerke, Professors Masson and Young, Mr."

155,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
156,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
157,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Astronomy is the oldest and most sublime of all the sciences. To a
158,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"contemplative observer of the heavens, the number and brilliancy of the"
159,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"stars, the lustre of the planets, the silvery aspect of the Moon, with"
160,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"her ever-changing phases, together with the order, the harmony, and"
161,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"unison pervading them all, create in his mind thoughts of wonder and"
162,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,admiration. Occupying the abyss of space indistinguishable from
163,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"infinity, the starry heavens in grandeur and magnificence surpass the"
164,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"loftiest conceptions of the human mind; for, at a distance beyond the"
165,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"range of ordinary vision, the telescope reveals clusters, systems,"
166,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"galaxies, universes of stars--suns--the innumerable host of heaven, each"
167,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"shining with a splendour comparable with that of our Sun, and, in all"
168,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"likelihood, fulfilling in a similar manner the same beneficent purposes."
169,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
170,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,The time when man began to study the stars is lost in the antiquity of
171,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,prehistoric ages. The ancient inhabitants of the Earth regarded the
172,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"heavenly bodies with veneration and awe, erected temples in their"
173,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"honour, and worshipped them as deities. Historical records of astronomy"
174,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,carry us back several thousand years. During the greater part of this
175,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"time, and until a comparatively recent period, astronomy was associated"
176,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,with astrology--a science which originated from a desire on the part of
177,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"mankind to penetrate the future, and which was based upon the supposed"
178,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,influence of the heavenly bodies upon human and terrestrial affairs. It
179,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,was natural to imagine that the overruling power which governed and
180,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"directed the course of sublunary events resided in the heavens, and that"
181,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,its decrees might be understood by watching the movements of the
182,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"heavenly bodies under its control. It was, therefore, believed that by"
183,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,observing the configuration of the planets and the positions of the
184,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"constellations at the instant of the birth of an individual, his"
185,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"horoscope, or destiny, could be foretold; and that by making"
186,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,observations of a somewhat similar nature the occurrence of events of
187,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"public importance could be predicted. When, however, the laws which"
188,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"govern the motions of the heavenly bodies became better known, and"
189,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"especially after the discovery of the great law of gravitation,"
190,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"astrology ceased to be a belief, though for long after it retained its"
191,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"power over the imagination, and was often alluded to in the writings of"
192,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,poets and other authors.
193,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
194,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"In the early dawn of astronomical science, the theories upheld with"
195,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,regard to the structure of the heavens were of a simple and primitive
196,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"nature, and might even be described as grotesque. This need occasion no"
197,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,surprise when we consider the difficulties with which ancient
198,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,astronomers had to contend in their endeavours to reduce to order and
199,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,harmony the complicated motions of the orbs which they beheld circling
200,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,around them.
201,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
202,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"The grouping of the stars into constellations having fanciful names,"
203,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"derived from fable or ancient mythology, occurred at a very early"
204,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"period, and though devoid of any methodical arrangement, is yet"
205,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,sufficiently well-defined to serve the purposes of modern astronomers.
206,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Several of the ancient nations of the earth, including the Chaldeans,"
207,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Egyptians, Hindus, and Chinese, claim to have been the earliest"
208,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,astronomers. Chinese records of astronomy reveal an antiquity of near
209,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"3,000 years B.C., but they contain no evidence that their authors"
210,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"possessed any scientific knowledge, and they merely record the"
211,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,occurrence of solar eclipses and the appearances of comets.
212,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
213,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,It is not known when astronomy was first studied by the Egyptians; but
214,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,what astronomical information they have handed down is not of a very
215,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"intelligible kind, nor have they left behind any data that can be relied"
216,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"upon. The Great Pyramid, judging from the exactness with which it faces"
217,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"the cardinal points, must have been designed by persons who possessed a"
218,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"good knowledge of astronomy, and it was probably made use of for"
219,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,observational purposes.
220,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
221,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,It is now generally admitted that correct astronomical observations were
222,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"first made on the plains of Chaldea, records of eclipses having been"
223,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"discovered in Chaldean cities which date back 2,234 years B.C. The"
224,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Chaldeans were true astronomers: they made correct observations of the
225,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,risings and settings of the heavenly bodies; and the exact orientation
226,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,of their temples and public buildings indicates the precision with which
227,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,they observed the positions of celestial objects. They invented the
228,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"zodiac and gnomon, made use of several kinds of dials, notified"
229,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"eclipses, and divided the day into twenty-four hours."
230,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
231,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,To the Greeks belongs the credit of having first studied astronomy in a
232,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,regular and systematic manner. THALES (640 B.C.) was one of the earliest
233,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"of Greek astronomers, and may be regarded as the founder of the science"
234,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"among that people. He was born at Miletus, and afterwards repaired to"
235,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Egypt for the purpose of study. On his return to Greece he founded the
236,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Ionian school, and taught the sphericity of the Earth, the obliquity of"
237,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"the ecliptic, and the true causes of eclipses of the Sun and Moon. He"
238,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,also directed the attention of mariners to the superiority of the Lesser
239,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Bear, as a guide for the navigation of vessels, as compared with the"
240,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Great Bear, by which constellation they usually steered. Thales believed"
241,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"the Earth to be the centre of the universe, and that the stars were"
242,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,composed of fire; he also predicted the occurrence of a great solar
243,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,eclipse.
244,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
245,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Thales had for his successors Anaximander, Anaximenes, and Anaxagoras,"
246,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,who taught the doctrines of the Ionian school.
247,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
248,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"The next great astronomer that we read of is PYTHAGORAS, who was born at"
249,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Samos 590 B.C. He studied under Thales, and afterwards visited Egypt and"
250,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"India, in order that he might make himself familiar with the scientific"
251,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,theories adopted by those nations. On his return to Europe he founded
252,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"his school in Italy, and taught in a more extended form the doctrines of"
253,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,the Ionian school. In his speculations with regard to the structure of
254,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,the universe he propounded the theory (though the reasons by which he
255,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,sustained it were fanciful) that the Sun is the centre of the planetary
256,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"system, and that the Earth revolves round him. This theory--the accuracy"
257,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,of which has since been confirmed--received but little attention from
258,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"his successors, and it sank into oblivion until the time of Copernicus,"
259,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,by whom it was revived. Pythagoras discovered that the Morning and
260,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Evening Stars are one and the same planet.
261,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
262,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Among the famous astronomers who lived about this period we find
263,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"recorded the names of Meton, who introduced the Metonic cycle into"
264,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Greece and erected the first sundial at Athens; Eudoxus, who persuaded"
265,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"the Greeks to adopt the year of 365-1/4 days; and Nicetas, who taught"
266,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,that the Earth completed a daily revolution on her axis.

268,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"The Alexandrian school, which flourished for three centuries prior to"
269,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"the Christian era, produced men of eminence whose discoveries and"
270,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"investigations, when arranged and classified, enabled astronomy to be"
271,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,regarded as a true theoretical science. The positions of the fixed stars
272,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"and the paths of the planets were determined with greater accuracy, and"
273,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,irregularities of the motions of the Sun and Moon were investigated with
274,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,greater precision. Attempts were made to ascertain the distance of the
275,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Sun from the Earth, and also the dimensions of the terrestrial sphere."
276,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"The obliquity of the ecliptic was accurately determined, and an arc of"
277,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,the meridian was measured between Syene and Alexandria. The names of
278,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Aristarchus, Eratosthenes, Aristyllus, Timocharis, and Autolycus, are"
279,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,familiarly known in association with the advancement of the astronomy of
280,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,this period.
281,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
282,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"We now reach the name of HIPPARCHUS of Bithynia (140 B.C.), the most"
283,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"illustrious astronomer of antiquity, who did much to raise astronomy to"
284,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"the position of a true science, and who has also left behind him ample"
285,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"evidence of his genius 'as a mathematician, an observer, and a"
286,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"theorist.' We are indebted to him for the earliest star catalogue, in"
287,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"which he included 1,081 stars. He discovered the Precession of the"
288,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Equinoxes, and determined the motions of the Sun and Moon, and also the"
289,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"length of the year, with greater precision than any of his predecessors."
290,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"He invented the sciences of plane and spherical trigonometry, and was"
291,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,the first to use right ascensions and declinations.
292,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
293,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"The next astronomer of eminence after Hipparchus was PTOLEMY (130 A.D.),"
294,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,who resided at Alexandria. He was skilled as a mathematician and
295,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"geographer, and also excelled as a musician. His chief discovery was an"
296,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"irregularity of the lunar motion, called the '_evection_.' He was also"
297,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,the first to observe the effect of the refraction of light in causing
298,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,the apparent displacement of a heavenly body from its true position.
299,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Ptolemy devoted much of his time to extending and improving the theories
300,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"of Hipparchus, and compiled a great treatise, called the 'Almagest,'"
301,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,which contains nearly all the knowledge we possess of ancient astronomy.
302,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Ptolemy's name is, however, most widely known in association with what"
303,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"is called the Ptolemaic theory. This system, which originated long"
304,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"before his time, but of which he was one of the ablest expounders, was"
305,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,an attempt to establish on a scientific basis the conclusions and
306,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,results arrived at by early astronomers who studied and observed the
307,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,motions of the heavenly bodies. Ptolemy regarded the Earth as the
308,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"immovable centre of the universe, round which the Sun, Moon, planets,"
309,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,and the entire heavens completed a daily revolution in twenty-four
310,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,hours. After the death of Ptolemy no worthy successor was found to
311,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"occupy his place, the study of astronomy began to decline among the"
312,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Greeks, and after a time it ceased to be cultivated by that people."
313,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
314,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"The Arabs next took up the study of astronomy, which they prosecuted"
315,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"most assiduously for a period of four centuries. Their labours were,"
316,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"however, confined chiefly to observational work, in which they"
317,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"excelled; unlike their predecessors, they paid but little attention to"
318,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"speculative theories--indeed, they regarded with such veneration the"
319,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"opinions held by the Greeks, that they did not feel disposed to question"
320,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,the accuracy of their doctrines. The most eminent astronomer among the
321,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Arabs was ALBATEGNIUS (680 A.D.). He corrected the Greek observations,"
322,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,and made several discoveries which testified to his abilities as an
323,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,observer. IBN YUNIS and ABUL WEFU were Arab astronomers who earned a
324,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,high reputation on account of the number and accuracy of their
325,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"observations. In Persia, a descendant of the famous Genghis Khan erected"
326,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"an observatory, where astronomical observations were systematically"
327,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"made. Omar, a Persian astronomer, suggested a reformation of the"
328,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"calendar which, if it had been adopted, would have insured greater"
329,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,accuracy than can be attained by the Gregorian style now in use. In
330,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"1433, Ulugh Beg, who resided at Samarcand, made many observations, and"
331,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,constructed a star catalogue of greater exactness than was known to
332,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,exist prior to his time. The Arabs may be regarded as having been the
333,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,custodians of astronomy until the time of its revival in another quarter
334,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,of the Globe.
335,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
336,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"After the lapse of many centuries, astronomy was introduced into Western"
337,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Europe in 1220, and from that date to the present time its career has"
338,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"been one of triumphant progress. In 1230, a translation of Ptolemy's"
339,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,'Almagest' from Arabic into Latin was accomplished by order of the
340,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"German Emperor, Frederick II.; and in 1252 Alphonso X., King of Castile,"
341,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"himself a zealous patron of astronomy, caused a new set of astronomical"
342,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"tables to be constructed at his own expense, which, in honour of his"
343,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Majesty, were called the 'Alphonsine Tables.' Purbach and Regiomontanus,"
344,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"two German astronomers of distinguished reputation, and Waltherus, a man"
345,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"of considerable renown, made many important observations in the"
346,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,fifteenth century.
347,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
348,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,The most eminent astronomer who lived during the latter part of this
349,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"century was Copernicus. NICOLAS COPERNICUS was born February 19, 1473,"
350,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"at Thorn, a small town situated on the Vistula, which formed the"
351,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,boundary between the kingdoms of Prussia and Poland. His father was a
352,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Polish subject, and his mother of German extraction. Having lost his"
353,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"parents early in life, he was educated under the supervision of his"
354,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"uncle Lucas, Bishop of Ermland. Copernicus attended a school at Thorn,"
355,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"and afterwards entered the University of Cracow, in 1491, where he"
356,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,devoted four years to the study of mathematics and science. On leaving
357,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Cracow he attached himself to the University of Bologna as a student of
358,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"canon law, and attended a course of lectures on astronomy given by"
359,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Novarra. In the ensuing year he was appointed canon of Frauenburg, the"
360,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"cathedral city of the Diocese of Ermland, situated on the shores of the"
361,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Frisches Haff. In the year 1500 he was at Rome, where he lectured on"
362,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,mathematics and astronomy. He next spent a few years at the University
363,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"of Padua, where, besides applying himself to mathematics and astronomy,"
364,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,he studied medicine and obtained a degree. In 1505 Copernicus returned
365,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"to his native country, and was appointed medical attendant to his uncle,"
366,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"the Bishop of Ermland, with whom he resided in the stately castle of"
367,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Heilsberg, situated at a distance of forty-six miles from Frauenburg."
368,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Copernicus lived with his uncle from 1507 till 1512, and during that"
369,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"time prosecuted his astronomical studies, and undertook, besides, many"
370,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,arduous duties associated with the administration of the diocese; these
371,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"he faithfully discharged until the death of the Bishop, which occurred"
372,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,in 1512. After the death of his uncle he took up his residence at
373,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Frauenburg, where he occupied his time in meditating on his new"
374,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"astronomy and undertaking various duties of a public character, which he"
375,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,fulfilled with credit and distinction. In 1523 he was appointed
376,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Administrator-General of the diocese. Though a canon of Frauenburg,"
377,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Copernicus never became a priest.
378,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
379,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"After many years of profound meditation and thought, Copernicus, in a"
380,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"treatise entitled 'De Revolutionibus Orbium Celestium,' propounded a new"
381,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"theory, or, more correctly speaking, revived the ancient Pythagorean"
382,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"system of the universe. This great work, which he dedicated to Pope Paul"
383,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"III., was completed in 1530; but he could not be prevailed upon to have"
384,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"it published until 1543, the year in which he died. In 1542 Copernicus"
385,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"had an apoplectic seizure, followed by paralysis and a gradual decay of"
386,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"his mental and vital powers. His book was printed at Nuremberg, and the"
387,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"first copy arrived at Frauenburg on May 24, 1543, in time to be touched"
388,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"by the hands of the dying man, who in a few hours after expired. The"
389,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"house in which Copernicus lived at Allenstein is still in existence, and"
390,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,in the walls of his chamber are visible the perforations which he made
391,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,for the purpose of observing the stars cross the meridian.
392,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
393,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Copernicus was the means of creating an entire revolution in the science
394,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"of astronomy, by transferring the centre of our system from the Earth to"
395,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,the Sun. He accounted for the alternation of day and night by the
396,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"rotation of the Earth on her axis, and for the vicissitudes of the"
397,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,seasons by her revolution round the Sun. He devoted the greater part of
398,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"his life to meditating on this theory, and adduced several weighty"
399,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,reasons in its support. Copernicus could not help perceiving the
400,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,complications and entanglements by which the Ptolemaic system of the
401,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"universe was surrounded, and which compared unfavourably with the simple"
402,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,and orderly manner in which other natural phenomena presented themselves
403,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,to his observation. By perceiving that Mars when in opposition was not
404,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"much inferior in lustre to Jupiter, and when in conjunction resembled a"
405,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"star of the second magnitude, he arrived at the conclusion that the"
406,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Earth could not be the centre of the planet's motion. Having discovered
407,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"in some ancient manuscripts a theory, ascribed to the Egyptians, that"
408,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Mercury and Venus revolved round the Sun, whilst they accompanied the"
409,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"orb in his revolution round the Earth, Copernicus was able to perceive"
410,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,that this afforded him a means of explaining the alternate appearance of
411,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,those planets on each side of the Sun. The varied aspects of the
412,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"superior planets, when observed in different parts of their orbits, also"
413,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,led him to conclude that the Earth was not the central body round which
414,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,they accomplished their revolutions. As a combined result of his
415,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,observation and reasoning Copernicus propounded the theory that the Sun
416,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"is the centre of our system, and that all the planets, including the"
417,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Earth, revolve in orbits around him. This, which is called the"
418,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Copernican system, is now regarded as, and has been proved to be, the"
419,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,true theory of the solar system.
420,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
421,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"TYCHO BRAHÉ was a celebrated Danish astronomer, who earned a deservedly"
422,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,high reputation on account of the number and accuracy of his
423,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,astronomical observations and calculations. The various astronomical
424,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"tables that were in use in his time contained many inaccuracies, and it"
425,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,became necessary that they should be reconstructed upon a more correct
426,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,basis. Tycho possessed the practical skill required for this kind of
427,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,work.
428,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
429,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"He was born December 14, 1546, at Knudstorp, near Helsingborg. His"
430,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"father, Otto Brahé, traced his descent from a Swedish family of noble"
431,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,birth. At the age of thirteen Tycho was sent to the University of
432,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Copenhagen, where it was intended he should prepare himself for the"
433,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,study of the law.
434,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
435,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"The prediction of a great solar eclipse, which was to happen on August"
436,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"21, 1560, caused much public excitement in Denmark, for in those days"
437,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,such phenomena were regarded as portending the occurrence of events of
438,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,national importance. Tycho looked forward with great eagerness to the
439,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"time of the eclipse. He watched its progress with intense interest, and"
440,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,when he perceived all the details of the phenomenon occur exactly as
441,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"they were predicted, he resolved to pursue the study of a science by"
442,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"which, as was then believed, the occurrence of future events could be"
443,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,foretold. From Copenhagen Tycho Brahé was sent to Leipsic to study
444,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"jurisprudence, but astronomy absorbed all his thoughts. He spent his"
445,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"pocket-money in purchasing astronomical books, and, when his tutor had"
446,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"retired to sleep, he occupied his time night after night in watching the"
447,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,stars and making himself familiar with their courses. He followed the
448,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"planets in their direct and retrograde movements, and with the aid of a"
449,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,small globe and pair of compasses was able by means of his own
450,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,calculations to detect serious discrepancies in the Alphonsine and
451,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Prutenic tables. In order to make himself more proficient in calculating
452,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"astronomical tables he studied arithmetic and geometry, and learned"
453,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,mathematics without the aid of a master. Having remained at Leipsic for
454,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"three years, during which time he paid far more attention to the study"
455,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"of astronomy than to that of law, he returned to his native country in"
456,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"consequence of the death of an uncle, who bequeathed him a considerable"
457,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"estate. In Denmark he continued to prosecute his astronomical studies,"
458,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"and incurred the displeasure of his friends, who blamed him for"
459,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"neglecting his intended profession and wasting his time on astronomy,"
460,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,which they regarded as useless and unprofitable.
461,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
462,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Not caring to remain among his relatives, Tycho Brahé returned to"
463,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Germany, and arrived at Wittenberg in 1566. Whilst residing here he had"
464,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,an altercation with a Danish gentleman over some question in
465,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"mathematics. The quarrel led to a duel with swords, which terminated"
466,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"rather unfortunately for Tycho, who had a portion of his nose cut off."
467,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"This loss he repaired by ingeniously contriving one of gold, silver, and"
468,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"wax, which was said to bear a good resemblance to the original. From"
469,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Wittenberg Tycho proceeded to Augsburg, where he resided for two years."
470,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Here he made the acquaintance of several men distinguished for their
471,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,learning and their love of astronomy. During his stay at Augsburg he
472,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"constructed a quadrant of fourteen cubits radius, on which were"
473,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,indicated the single minutes of a degree; he made many valuable
474,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"observations with this instrument, which he used in combination with a"
475,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,large sextant.
476,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
477,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"In 1571 Tycho returned to Denmark, where his fame as an astronomer had"
478,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"preceded him, and was the means of procuring for him a hearty welcome"
479,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"from his relatives and friends. In 1572, when returning one night from"
480,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,his laboratory--for Tycho studied alchemy as well as astronomy--he
481,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,beheld what appeared to be a new and brilliant star in the
482,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"constellation Cassiopeia, which was situated overhead. He directed the"
483,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"attention of his companions to this wonderful object, and all declared"
484,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,that they had never observed such a star before. On the following night
485,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"he measured its distance from the nearest stars in the constellation,"
486,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"and arrived at the conclusion that it was a fixed star, and beyond our"
487,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,system.
488,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
489,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"This remarkable object remained visible for sixteen months, and when at"
490,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,its brightest rivalled Sirius. At first it was of a brilliant white
491,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"colour, but as it diminished in size it became yellow; it next changed"
492,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"to a red colour, resembling Aldebaran; afterwards it appeared like"
493,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Saturn, and as it grew smaller it decreased in brightness, until it"
494,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,finally became invisible. In 1573 Tycho Brahé married a peasant-girl
495,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,from the village of Knudstorp. This imprudent act roused the resentment
496,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"of his relatives, who, being of noble birth, were indignant that he"
497,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,should have contracted such an alliance. The bitterness and mutual
498,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,ill-feeling created by this affair became so intense that the King of
499,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Denmark deemed it advisable to endeavour to bring about a
500,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,reconciliation.
501,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
502,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"After this Tycho returned to Germany, and visited several cities before"
503,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,deciding where he should take up his permanent residence.
504,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
505,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,His fame as an astronomer was now so great that he was received with
506,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"distinction wherever he went, and on the occasion of a visit to"
507,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Hesse-Cassel he spent a few pleasant days with William, Landgrave of"
508,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Hesse, who was himself skilled in astronomy."
509,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
510,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Frederick II., King of Denmark, having recognised Tycho Brahé's great"
511,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"merits as an astronomer, and not wishing that his fame should add lustre"
512,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"to a foreign Court, expressed a desire that he should return to his"
513,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"native country, and as an inducement offered him a life interest in the"
514,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"island of Huen, in the Sound, where he undertook to erect and equip an"
515,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,observatory at his own expense; the King also promised to bestow upon
516,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"him a pension, and grant him other emoluments besides."
517,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
518,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Tycho gladly accepted this generous offer, and during the construction"
519,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,of the observatory occupied his time in making a magnificent collection
520,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,of instruments and appliances adapted for observational purposes. This
521,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"handsome edifice, upon which the King of Denmark expended a sum of"
522,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"20,000_l._, was called 'Uranienburg' ('The Citadel of the Heavens')."
523,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Here Tycho resided for a period of twenty years, during which time he"
524,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"pursued his astronomical labours with untiring energy and zeal, and made"
525,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,a large number of observations and calculations of much superior
526,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"accuracy to any that existed previously, which were afterwards of great"
527,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"service to his successors. During his long residence at Huen, Tycho was"
528,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"visited by many distinguished persons, who were attracted to his island"
529,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,home by his fame and the magnificence of his observatory. Among them was
530,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"James VI. of Scotland, who, whilst journeying to the Court of Denmark"
531,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"on the occasion of his marriage to a Danish princess, paid Tycho a"
532,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"visit, and enjoyed his hospitality for a week. The King was delighted"
533,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"with all that he saw, and on his departure presented Tycho with a"
534,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"handsome donation, and at his request composed some Latin verses, in"
535,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,which he eulogised his host and praised his observatory.
536,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
537,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,The island of Huen is situated about six miles from the coast of
538,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Zealand, and fourteen from Copenhagen. It has a circumference of six"
539,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"miles, and consists chiefly of an elevated plateau, in the centre of"
540,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"which Tycho erected his observatory, the site of which is now marked by"
541,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,two pits and a few mounds of earth--all that remains of Uranienburg. All
542,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,went well with Tycho Brahé during the lifetime of his noble patron; but
543,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"in 1588 Frederick II. died, and was succeeded by his son, a youth eleven"
544,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,years of age.
545,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
546,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"The Danish nobles had long been jealous of Tycho's fame and reputation,"
547,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,and on the death of the King an opportunity was afforded them of
548,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,intriguing with the object of accomplishing his downfall. Several false
549,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"accusations were brought against him, and the Court party made the"
550,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,impoverished state of the Treasury an excuse for depriving him of his
551,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,pension and emoluments granted by the late King.
552,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
553,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Tycho was no longer able to bear the expense of maintaining his
554,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"establishment at Huen, and fearing that he might be deprived of the"
555,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"island itself, he took a house in Copenhagen, to which he removed all"
556,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,his smaller instruments.
557,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
558,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,During his residence in the capital he was subjected to annoyance and
559,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,persecution. An order was issued in the King's name preventing him from
560,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"carrying on his chemical experiments, and he besides suffered the"
561,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,indignity of a personal assault. Tycho Brahé resolved to quit his
562,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"ungrateful country and seek a home in some foreign land, where he should"
563,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,be permitted to pursue his studies unmolested and live in quietness and
564,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,peace. He accordingly removed from the island of Huen all his
565,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"instruments and appliances that were of a portable nature, and packed"
566,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"them on board a vessel which he hired for the purpose of transport, and,"
567,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"having embarked with his family, his servants, and some of his pupils"
568,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"and assistants, 'this interesting barque, freighted with the glory of"
569,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Denmark,' set sail from Copenhagen about the end of 1597, and having"
570,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"crossed the Baltic in safety, arrived at Rostock, where Tycho found some"
571,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,old friends waiting to receive him. He was now in doubt as to where he
572,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"should find a home, when the Austrian Emperor Rudolph, himself a liberal"
573,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"patron of science and the fine arts, having heard of Tycho Brahé's"
574,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"misfortunes, sent him an invitation to take up his abode in his"
575,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"dominions, and promised that he should be treated in a manner worthy of"
576,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,his reputation and fame.
577,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
578,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Tycho resolved to accept the Emperor's kind invitation, and in the"
579,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"spring of 1599 arrived at Prague, where he found a handsome residence"
580,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,prepared for his reception.
581,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
582,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,He was received by the Emperor in a most cordial manner and treated with
583,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,the greatest kindness. An annual pension of three thousand crowns was
584,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"settled upon him for life, and he was to have his choice of several"
585,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"residences belonging to his Majesty, where he might reside and erect a"
586,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"new observatory. From among these he selected the Castle of Benach, in"
587,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Bohemia, which was situated on an elevated plateau and commanded a wide"
588,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,view of the horizon.
589,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
590,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"During his residence at Benach Tycho received a visit from Kepler, who"
591,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,stayed with him for several months in order that he might carry out some
592,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"astronomical observations. In the following year Kepler returned, and"
593,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"took up his permanent residence with Tycho, having been appointed"
594,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"assistant in his observatory, a post which, at Tycho's request, was"
595,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,conferred upon him by the Emperor.
596,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
597,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Tycho Brahé soon discovered that his ignorance of the language and
598,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,unfamiliarity with the customs of the people caused him much
599,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,inconvenience. He therefore asked permission from the Emperor to be
600,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"allowed to remove to Prague. This request was readily granted, and a"
601,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,suitable residence was provided for him in the city.
602,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
603,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"In the meantime his family, his large instruments, and other property,"
604,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"having arrived at Prague, Tycho was soon comfortably settled in his new"
605,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,home.
606,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
607,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Though Tycho Brahé continued his astronomical observations, yet he could"
608,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,not help feeling that he lived among a strange people; nor did the
609,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,remembrance of his sufferings and the cruel treatment he received at the
610,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,hands of his fellow-countrymen subdue the affection which he cherished
611,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"towards his native land. Pondering over the past, he became despondent"
612,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,and low-spirited; a morbid imagination caused him to brood over small
613,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"troubles, and gloomy, melancholy thoughts possessed his mind--symptoms"
614,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,which seemed to presage the approach of some serious malady. One
615,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"evening, when visiting at the house of a friend, he was seized with a"
616,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"painful illness, to which he succumbed in less than a fortnight. He died"
617,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"at Prague on October 24, 1601, when in his fifty-fifth year."
618,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
619,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"The Emperor Rudolph, when informed of Tycho Brahé's death, expressed his"
620,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"deep regret, and commanded that he should be interred in the principal"
621,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"church in the city, and that his obsequies should be celebrated with"
622,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,every mark of honour and respect.
623,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
624,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Tycho Brahé stands out as the most romantic and prominent figure in the
625,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"history of astronomy. His independence of character, his ardent"
626,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"attachments, his strong hatreds, and his love of splendour, are"
627,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,characteristics which distinguish him from all other men of his age.
628,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"This remarkable man was an astronomer, astrologer, and alchemist; but in"
629,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"his latter years he renounced astrology, and believed that the stars"
630,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,exercised no influence over the destinies of mankind.
631,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
632,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"As a practical astronomer, Tycho Brahé has not been excelled by any"
633,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,other observer of the heavens. The magnificence of his observatory at
634,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Huen, upon the equipment and embellishment of which it is stated he"
635,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"expended a ton of gold; the splendour and variety of his instruments,"
636,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"and his ingenuity in inventing new ones, would alone have made him"
637,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,famous. But it was by the skill and assiduity with which he carried out
638,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,his numerous and important observations that he has earned for himself a
639,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,position of the most honourable distinction among astronomers. In his
640,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,investigation of the Lunar theory Tycho Brahé discovered the Moon's
641,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"_annual equation_, a yearly effect produced by the Sun's disturbing"
642,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,force as the Earth approaches or recedes from him in her orbit. He also
643,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"discovered another inequality in the Moon's motion, called the"
644,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,_variation_. He determined with greater exactness astronomical
645,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"refractions from an altitude of 45° downwards to the horizon, and"
646,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,constructed a catalogue of 777 stars. He also made a vast number of
647,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"observations on planets, which formed the basis of the 'Rudolphine"
648,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Tables,' and were of invaluable assistance to Kepler in his"
649,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,investigation of the laws relating to planetary motion.
650,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
651,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Tycho Brahé declined to accept the Copernican theory, and devised a"
652,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"system of his own, which he called the 'Tychonic.' By this arrangement"
653,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"the Earth remained stationary, whilst all the planets revolved round"
654,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"the Sun, who in his turn completed a daily revolution round the Earth."
655,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,All the phenomena associated with the motions of those bodies could be
656,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"explained by means of this system; but it did not receive much support,"
657,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,and after the Copernican theory became better understood it was given
658,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"up, and heard of no more."
659,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
660,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"We now arrive at the name of KEPLER, one of the very greatest of"
661,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"astronomers, and a man of remarkable genius, who was the first to"
662,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,discover the real nature of the paths pursued by the Earth and planets
663,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,in their revolution round the Sun. After seventeen years of close
664,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"observation, he announced that those bodies travelled round the Sun in"
665,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"elliptical or oval orbits, and not in circular paths, as was believed by"
666,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Copernicus. In his investigation of the laws which govern the motions of
667,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,the planets he formulated those famous theorems known as 'Kepler's
668,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Laws,' which will endure for all time as a proof of his sagacity and"
669,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"surpassing genius. Prior to the discovery of those laws the Sun, though"
670,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"acknowledged to be the centre of the system, did not appear to occupy a"
671,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"central position as regards the motions of the planets; but Kepler, by"
672,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"demonstrating that the planes of the orbits of all the planets, and the"
673,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"lines connecting their apsides, passed through the Sun, was enabled to"
674,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,assign the orb his true position with regard to those bodies.
675,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
676,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"JOHN KEPLER was born at Weil, in the Duchy of Wurtemberg, December 21,"
677,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"1571. His parents, though of noble family, lived in reduced"
678,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"circumstances, owing to causes for which they were themselves chiefly"
679,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,responsible. In his youth Kepler suffered so much from ill-health that
680,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,his education had to be neglected. In 1586 he was sent to a monastic
681,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"school at Maulbronn, which had been established at the Reformation, and"
682,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,was under the patronage of the Duke of Wurtemberg. Afterwards he studied
683,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"at the University of Tubingen, where he distinguished himself and took a"
684,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"degree. Kepler devoted his attention chiefly to science and mathematics,"
685,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"but paid no particular attention to the study of astronomy. Maestlin,"
686,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"the professor of mathematics, whose lectures he attended, upheld the"
687,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Copernican theory, and Kepler, who adopted the views of his teacher,"
688,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"wrote an essay in favour of the diurnal rotation of the Earth, in which"
689,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"he supported the more recent astronomical doctrines. In 1594, a vacancy"
690,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,having occurred in the professorship of astronomy at Gratz consequent
691,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"upon the death of George Stadt, Kepler was appointed his successor. He"
692,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"did not seek this office, as he felt no particular desire to take up the"
693,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"study of astronomy, but was recommended by his tutors as a man well"
694,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,fitted for the post. He was thus in a manner compelled to devote his
695,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,time and talents to the science of astronomy. Kepler directed his
696,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"attention to three subjects--viz. 'the number, the size, and the motion"
697,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,of the orbits of the planets.' He endeavoured to ascertain if any
698,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"regular proportion existed between the sizes of the planetary orbits, or"
699,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"in the difference of their sizes, but in this he was unsuccessful. He"
700,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"then thought that, by imagining the existence of a planet between Mars"
701,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"and Jupiter, and another between Venus and Mercury, he might be able to"
702,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,attain his object; but he found that this assumption afforded him no
703,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,assistance. Kepler then imagined that as there were five regular
704,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"geometrical solids, and five planets, the distances of the latter were"
705,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,regulated by the size of the solids described round one another. The
706,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,discovery afterwards of two additional planets testified to the
707,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,absurdity of this speculation. A description of these extraordinary
708,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"researches was published, in 1596, in a work entitled 'Prodromus of"
709,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Cosmographical Dissertations; containing the cosmographical mystery
710,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"respecting the admirable proportion of the celestial orbits, and the"
711,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"genuine and real causes of the number, magnitude, and periods of the"
712,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"planets, demonstrated by the five regular geometrical solids.' This"
713,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"volume, notwithstanding the fanciful speculations which it contained,"
714,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"was received with much favour by astronomers, and both Tycho Brahé and"
715,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Galileo encouraged Kepler to continue his researches. Galileo admired
716,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"his ingenuity, and Tycho advised him 'to lay a solid foundation for his"
717,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"views by actual observation, and then, by ascending from these, to"
718,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,strive to reach the causes of things.' Kepler spent many years in these
719,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,fruitless endeavours before he made those grand discoveries in search of
720,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,which he laboured so long.
721,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
722,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,The religious dissensions which at this time agitated Germany were
723,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,accompanied in many places by much tumult and excitement. At Gratz the
724,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Catholics threatened to expel the Protestants from the city. Kepler, who"
725,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"was of the Reformed faith, having recognised the danger with which he"
726,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"was threatened, retired to Hungary with his wife, whom he had recently"
727,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"married, and remained there for near twelve months, during which time he"
728,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,occupied himself with writing several short treatises on subjects
729,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,connected with astronomy. In 1599 he returned to Gratz and resumed his
730,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,professorship.
731,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
732,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"In the year 1600 Kepler set out to pay Tycho Brahé a visit at Prague, in"
733,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,order that he might be able to avail himself of information contained in
734,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,observations made by Tycho with regard to the eccentricities of the
735,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"orbits of the planets. He was received by Tycho with much cordiality,"
736,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"and stayed with him for four months at his residence at Benach, Tycho in"
737,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,the meantime having promised that he would use his influence with the
738,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Emperor Rudolph to have him appointed as assistant in his observatory.
739,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"On the termination of his visit Kepler returned to Gratz, and as there"
740,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"was a renewal of the religious trouble in the city, he resigned his"
741,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"professorship, from which he only derived a small income, and, relying"
742,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"on Tycho's promise, he again journeyed to Prague, and arrived there in"
743,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"1601. Kepler was presented to the Emperor by Tycho, and the post of"
744,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Imperial Mathematician was conferred upon him, with a salary of 100"
745,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"florins a year, upon condition that he should assist Tycho in his"
746,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"observatory. This appointment was of much value to Kepler, because it"
747,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,afforded him an opportunity of obtaining access to the numerous
748,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"astronomical observations made by Tycho, which were of great assistance"
749,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,to him in the investigation of the subject which he had chosen--viz. the
750,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"laws which govern the motions of the planets, and the form and size of"
751,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,the planetary orbits.
752,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
753,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"As an acknowledgment of the Emperor's great kindness, the two"
754,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"astronomers resolved to compute a new set of astronomical tables, and in"
755,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,honour of his Majesty they were to be called the 'Rudolphine Tables.'
756,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"This project pleased the Emperor, who promised to defray the expense of"
757,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"their publication. Logomontanus, Tycho's chief assistant, had entrusted"
758,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"to him that portion of the work relating to observations on the stars,"
759,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,and Kepler had charge of the part which embraced the calculations
760,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,belonging to the planets and their orbits. This important work had
761,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"scarcely been begun when the departure of Logomontanus, who obtained an"
762,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"appointment in Denmark, and the death of Tycho Brahé in October 1601,"
763,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,necessitated its suspension for a time. Kepler was appointed Chief
764,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Mathematician to the Emperor in succession to Tycho--a position of
765,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"honour and distinction, and to which was attached a handsome salary,"
766,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,that was paid out of the Imperial treasury. But owing to the continuance
767,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"of expensive wars, which entailed a severe drain upon the resources of"
768,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"the country, the public funds became very low, and Kepler's salary was"
769,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,always in arrear. This condition of things involved him in serious
770,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"pecuniary difficulties, and the responsibility of having to maintain an"
771,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,increasing family added to his anxieties. It was with the greatest
772,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,difficulty that he succeeded in obtaining payment of even a portion of
773,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"his salary, and he was reduced to such straits as to be under the"
774,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,necessity of casting nativities in order to obtain money to meet his
775,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,most pressing requirements.
776,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
777,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"In 1609 Kepler published his great work, entitled 'The New Astronomy;"
778,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"or, Commentaries on the Motions of Mars.' It was by his observation of"
779,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Mars, which has an orbit of greater eccentricity than that of any of the"
780,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"other planets, with the exception of Mercury, that he was enabled, after"
781,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"years of patient study, to announce in this volume the discovery of two"
782,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"of the three famous theorems known as Kepler's Laws. The first is, that"
783,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"all the planets move round the Sun in elliptic orbits, and that the orb"
784,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"occupies one of the foci. The second is, that the radius-vector, or"
785,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,imaginary line joining the centre of the planet and the centre of the
786,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Sun, describes equal areas in equal times. The third law, which relates"
787,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,to the connection between the periodic times and the distances of the
788,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"planets, was not discovered until ten years later, when Kepler, in 1619,"
789,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"issued another work, called the 'Harmonies of the World,' dedicated to"
790,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"James I. of England, in which was contained this remarkable law. These"
791,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"laws have elevated astronomy to the position of a true physical science,"
792,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,and also formed the starting-point of Newton's investigations which led
793,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,to the discovery of the law of gravitation. Kepler's delight on the
794,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,discovery of his third law was unbounded. He writes: 'Nothing holds me.
795,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,I will indulge in my sacred fury. I will triumph over mankind by the
796,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,honest confession that I have stolen the golden vases of the Egyptians
797,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,to build up a tabernacle for my God far away from the confines of Egypt.
798,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"If you forgive me, I rejoice; if you are angry, I can bear it. The die"
799,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"is cast; the book is written, to be read either now or by posterity I"
800,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"care not which. It may well wait a century for a reader, as God has"
801,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,waited six thousand years for an observer.'
802,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
803,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"When Kepler presented his celebrated book to the Emperor, he remarked"
804,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,that it was his intention to make a similar attack upon the other
805,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"planets, and promised that he would be successful if his Majesty would"
806,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,undertake to find the means necessary for carrying on operations. But
807,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,the Emperor had more formidable enemies to contend with nearer home than
808,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Jupiter and Saturn, and no funds were forthcoming to assist Kepler in"
809,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,his undertaking.
810,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
811,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"The chair of mathematics in the University of Linz having become vacant,"
812,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Kepler offered himself as a candidate for the appointment, which he was"
813,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,anxious to obtain; but the Emperor Rudolph was averse to his leaving
814,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Prague, and encouraged him to hope that the arrears of his salary would"
815,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,be paid. But past experience led Kepler to have no very sanguine
816,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"expectations on this point; nor was it until after the death of Rudolph,"
817,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"in 1612, that he was relieved from his pecuniary embarrassments."
818,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
819,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"On the accession of Rudolph's brother, Matthias, to the Austrian throne,"
820,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Kepler was reappointed Imperial Mathematician; he was also permitted to
821,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"hold the professorship at Linz, to which he had been elected. Kepler was"
822,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"not loth to remove from Prague, where he had spent eleven years harassed"
823,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,by poverty and other domestic afflictions. Having settled with his
824,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"family at Linz, Kepler issued another work, in 1618, entitled 'Epitome"
825,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"of the Copernican Astronomy,' in which he gave a general account of his"
826,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"astronomical observations and discoveries, and a summary of his opinions"
827,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,with regard to the theories which in those days were the subject of
828,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,controversial discussion. Almost immediately after its publication it
829,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"was included by the Congregation of the Index, at Rome, in the list of"
830,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"prohibited books. This occasioned Kepler considerable alarm, as he"
831,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"imagined it might interfere with the sale of his works, or give rise to"
832,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"difficulties in the issue of others. He, however, was assured by his"
833,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,friend Remus that the action of the Papal authorities need cause him no
834,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,anxiety.
835,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
836,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"The Emperor Matthias died in 1619, and was succeeded by Ferdinand III.,"
837,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"who not only retained Kepler in his office, but gave orders that all the"
838,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"arrears of his salary should be paid, including those which accumulated"
839,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,during the reign of Rudolph; he also expressed a desire that the
840,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,'Rudolphine Tables' should be published without delay and at his cost.
841,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"But other obstacles intervened, for at this time Germany was involved in"
842,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"a civil and religious war, which interfered with all peaceful"
843,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,vocations. Kepler's library at Linz was sealed up by order of the
844,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Jesuits, and the city was for a time besieged by troops. This state of"
845,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,public affairs necessitated a considerable delay in the publication of
846,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,the 'Tables.'
847,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
848,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,The 'Rudolphine Tables' were published at Ulm in 1627. They were
849,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"commenced by Tycho Brahé, and completed by Kepler, who made his"
850,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"calculations from Tycho's observations, and based them upon his own"
851,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,great discovery of the ellipticity of the orbits of the planets. They
852,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,are divided into four parts. The first and third parts contain
853,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,logarithmic and other tables for the purpose of facilitating
854,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"astronomical calculations; in the second are tables of the Sun, Moon,"
855,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,and planets; and in the fourth are indicated the positions of one
856,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,thousand stars as determined by Tycho. Kepler made a special journey to
857,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Prague in order to present the 'Tables' to the Emperor, and afterwards"
858,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,the Grand Duke of Tuscany sent him a gold chain as an acknowledgment of
859,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,his appreciation of the completion of this great work.
860,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
861,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Albert Wallenstein, Duke of Friedland, an accomplished scholar and a man"
862,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"fond of scientific pursuits, made Kepler a most liberal offer if he"
863,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,would take up his residence in his dominions. After duly considering
864,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"this proposal, Kepler decided to accept the Duke's offer, provided it"
865,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"received the sanction of the Emperor. This was readily given, and"
866,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Kepler, in 1629, removed with his family from Linz to Sagan, in Silesia."
867,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"The Duke of Friedland treated him with great kindness and liberality,"
868,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,and through his influence he was appointed to a professorship in the
869,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,University of Rostock. Though Kepler was permitted to retain the pension
870,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"bestowed upon him by the late Emperor Rudolph, he was unable after his"
871,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"removal to Silesia to obtain payment of it, and there was a large"
872,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,accumulation of arrears. In a final endeavour to recover the amount
873,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"owing to him he travelled to Ratisbon, and appealed to the Imperial"
874,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Assembly, but without success. The fatigue which Kepler endured on his"
875,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"journey, combined with vexation and disappointment, brought on a fever,"
876,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"which terminated fatally. He died on November 15, 1630, when in the"
877,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"sixtieth year of his age, and was interred in St. Peter's churchyard,"
878,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Ratisbon.
879,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
880,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Kepler was a man of indomitable energy and perseverance, and spared"
881,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,neither time nor trouble in the accomplishment of any object which he
882,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"took in hand. In thinking over the form of the orbits of the planets, he"
883,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,writes: 'I brooded with the whole energy of my mind on this
884,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"subject--asking why they are not other than they are--the number, the"
885,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"size, and the motions of the orbits.' But many fanciful ideas passed"
886,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,through Kepler's imaginative brain before he hit upon the true form of
887,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,the planetary orbits. In his 'Mysterium Cosmographicum' he asserts that
888,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"the five kinds of regular polyhedral solids, when described round one"
889,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"another, regulated the distances of the planets and size of the"
890,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,planetary orbits. In support of this theory he writes as follows: 'The
891,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,orbit of the Earth is the measure of the rest. About it circumscribe a
892,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,dodecahedron. The sphere including this will be that of Mars. About
893,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Mars' orbit describe a tetrahedron; the sphere containing this will be
894,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Jupiter's orbit. Round Jupiter's describe a cube; the sphere including
895,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,this will be Saturn's. Within the Earth's orbit inscribe an icosahedron;
896,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,the sphere inscribed in it will be Venus's orbit. In Venus inscribe an
897,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,octahedron; the sphere inscribed in it will be Mercury's.'
898,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
899,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,The above quotation is an instance of Kepler's wild and imaginative
900,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"genius, which ultimately led him to make those sublime discoveries"
901,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,associated with planetary motion which are known as 'Kepler's Laws.'
902,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
903,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,He describes himself as 'troublesome and choleric in politics and
904,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,domestic matters;' but in his relations with scientific men he was
905,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"affable and pleasant. He showed no jealousy of a rival, and was always"
906,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,ready to recognise merit in others; nor did he hesitate to acknowledge
907,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,any error of his own when more recent discoveries proved that he was
908,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,wrong.
909,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
910,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Some of his works contain passages, written in a jocular strain,"
911,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,indicative of a bright and cheerful temperament. The following
912,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,characteristic paragraph refers to the opinions of the Epicureans with
913,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"regard to the appearance of a new star, which they ascribed to a"
914,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"fortuitous concourse of atoms: 'When I was a youth, with plenty of idle"
915,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"time on my hands, I was much taken with the vanity, of which some grown"
916,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"men are not ashamed, of making anagrams by transposing the letters of my"
917,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,name written in Latin so as to make another sentence. Out of Ioannes
918,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Keplerus came _Serpens in akuleo_ (a serpent in his sting); but not
919,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"being satisfied with the meaning of these words, and being unable to"
920,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"make another, I trusted the thing to chance, and, taking out of a pack"
921,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"of playing-cards as many as there were letters in the name, I wrote one"
922,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"upon each, and then began to shuffle them, and at each shuffle to read"
923,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"them in the order they came, to see if any meaning came of it. Now, may"
924,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"all the Epicurean gods and goddesses confound this same chance, which,"
925,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"although I have spent a good deal of time over it, never showed me"
926,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"anything like sense, even from a distance. So I gave up my cards to the"
927,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Epicurean eternity, to be carried away into infinity; and it is said"
928,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"they are still flying about there, in the utmost confusion, among the"
929,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"atoms, and have never yet come to any meaning. I will tell those"
930,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"disputants, my opponents, not my own opinion, but my wife's. Yesterday,"
931,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"when weary with writing, and my mind quite dusty with considering these"
932,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"atoms, I was called to supper, and a salad I had asked for was set"
933,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"before me. ""It seems, then,"" said I aloud, ""that if pewter dishes,"
934,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"leaves of lettuce, grains of salt, drops of water, vinegar and oil, and"
935,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"slices of egg, had been flying about in the air from all eternity, it"
936,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"might at last happen by chance that there would come a salad."" ""Yes,"""
937,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"says my wife, ""but not so nice and well dressed as this of mine is.""'"
938,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
939,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Notwithstanding the frequent interruptions which, owing to various"
940,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"reasons, retarded his labours, Kepler was able to bring to a successful"
941,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,completion the numerous and important works upon which he was engaged
942,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"during his lifetime, the voluminous nature of which may be imagined when"
943,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"it is stated that he published thirty-three separate works, besides"
944,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,leaving behind twenty-two volumes of manuscript.
945,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
946,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"During his researches on the motions of Mars, Kepler discovered that the"
947,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"planet sometimes travelled at an accelerated rate of speed, and at"
948,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,another time its pace was diminished. At one time he observed it to be
949,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"in advance of the place where he calculated it should be found, and at"
950,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"another time it was behind it. This caused him considerable perplexity,"
951,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"and, feeling convinced in his mind that the form of the planet's orbit"
952,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"could not be circular, he was compelled to turn his attention to some"
953,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"other closed curve, by which those inequalities of motion could be"
954,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,explained.
955,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
956,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"After years of careful observation and study, Kepler arrived at the"
957,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"conclusion that the form of the planet's orbit is an ellipse, and that"
958,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,the Sun occupies one of the foci. He afterwards determined that the
959,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,orbits of all the planets are of an elliptical form.
960,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
961,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Having discovered the true form of the planetary orbits, Kepler next"
962,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,endeavoured to ascertain the cause which regulates the unequal motion
963,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,that a planet pursues in its path. He observed that when a planet
964,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"approached the Sun its motion was accelerated, and as it receded from"
965,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,him its pace became slower.
966,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
967,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,This he explained in his next great discovery by proving that an
968,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"imaginary line, or radius-vector, extending from the centre of the Sun"
969,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,to the centre of the planet 'describes equal areas in equal times.' When
970,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"near the Sun, or at perihelion, a planet traverses a larger portion of"
971,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,its arc in the same period of time than it does when at the opposite
972,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"part of its orbit, or when at aphelion; but, as the areas of both are"
973,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"equal, it follows that the planet does not always maintain the same rate"
974,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"of speed, and that its velocity is greatest when nearest the Sun, and"
975,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,least when most distant from him.
976,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
977,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,By the application of his first and second laws Kepler was able to
978,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,formulate a third law. He found that there existed a remarkable
979,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,relationship between the mean distances of the planets and the times in
980,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"which they complete their revolutions round the Sun, and discovered"
981,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,'that the squares of the periodic times are to each in the same
982,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,proportion as the cubes of the mean distances.' The periodic time of a
983,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"planet having been ascertained, the square of the mean distance and the"
984,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,mean distance itself can be obtained. It is by the application of this
985,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,law that the distances of the planets are usually calculated.
986,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
987,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"These discoveries are known as Kepler's Laws, and are usually classified"
988,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,as follows:--
989,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
990,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"1. 'The orbit described by every planet is an ellipse, of which the"
991,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,centre of the Sun occupies one of the foci.
992,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
993,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"2. 'Every planet moves round the Sun in a plane orbit, and the"
994,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"radius-vector, or imaginary line joining the centre of the planet and"
995,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"the centre of the Sun, describes equal areas in equal times."
996,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
997,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,3. 'The squares of the periodic times of any two planets are
998,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,proportional to the cubes of their mean distances from the Sun.'[1]
999,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
1000,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,These remarkable discoveries do not embrace all the achievements by
1001,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"which Kepler has immortalised his name, and earned for himself the proud"
1002,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,title of 'Legislator of the Heavens;' he predicted transits of Mercury
1003,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"and Venus, made important discoveries in optics, and was the inventor of"
1004,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,the astronomical telescope.
1005,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
1006,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"GALILEO GALILEI, the famous Italian astronomer and philosopher, and the"
1007,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"contemporary of Kepler and of Milton, was born at Pisa on February 15,"
1008,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,1564.
1009,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
1010,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"His father, who traced his descent from an ancient Florentine family,"
1011,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"was desirous that his son should adopt the profession of medicine, and"
1012,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,with this intention he entered him as a student at the University of
1013,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Pisa. Galileo, however, soon discovered that the study of mathematics"
1014,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"and mechanical science possessed a greater attraction for his mind,"
1015,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"and, following his inclinations, he resolved to devote his energies to"
1016,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,acquiring proficiency in those subjects.
1017,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
1018,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,In 1583 his attention was attracted by the oscillation of a brass lamp
1019,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,suspended from the ceiling of the cathedral at Pisa. Galileo was
1020,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,impressed with the regularity of its motion as it swung backwards and
1021,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"forwards, and was led to imagine that the pendulum movement might prove"
1022,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,a valuable method for the correct measurement of time. The practical
1023,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,application of this idea he afterwards adopted in the construction of an
1024,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,astronomical clock.
1025,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
1026,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Having become proficient in mathematics, Galileo, whilst engaged in"
1027,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"studying the writings of Archimedes, wrote an essay on 'The Hydrostatic"
1028,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Balance,' and composed a treatise on 'The Centre of Gravity in Solid"
1029,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Bodies.' The reputation which he earned by these contributions to
1030,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,science procured for him the appointment of Lecturer on Mathematics at
1031,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,the University of Pisa. Galileo next directed his attention to the works
1032,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"of Aristotle, and made no attempt to conceal the disfavour with which he"
1033,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,regarded many of the doctrines taught by the Greek philosopher; nor had
1034,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"he any difficulty in exposing their inaccuracies. One of these, which"
1035,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,maintained that the heavier of two bodies descended to the earth with
1036,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"the greater rapidity, he proved to be incorrect, and demonstrated by"
1037,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"experiment from the top of the tower at Pisa that, except for the"
1038,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"unequal resistance of the air, all bodies fell to the ground with the"
1039,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,same velocity.
1040,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
1041,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"As the chief expounder of the new philosophy, Galileo had to encounter"
1042,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"the prejudices of the followers of Aristotle, and of all those who"
1043,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,disliked any innovation or change in the established order of things.
1044,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"The antagonism which existed between Galileo and his opponents, who were"
1045,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"both numerous and influential, was intensified by the bitterness and"
1046,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"sarcasm which he imparted into his controversies, and the attitude"
1047,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,assumed by his enemies at last became so threatening that he deemed it
1048,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,prudent to resign the Chair of Mathematics in the University of Pisa.
1049,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
1050,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"In the following year he was appointed to a similar post at Padua, where"
1051,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,his fame attracted crowds of pupils from all parts of Europe.
1052,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
1053,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,In 1611 Galileo visited Rome. He was received with much distinction by
1054,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"the different learned societies, and was enrolled a member of the"
1055,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Lyncæan Academy. In two years after his visit to the capital he
1056,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,published a work in which he declared his adhesion to the Copernican
1057,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"theory, and openly avowed his disbelief in the astronomical facts"
1058,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,recorded in the Scriptures. Galileo maintained that the sacred writings
1059,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"were not intended for the purpose of imparting scientific information,"
1060,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,and that it was impossible for men to ignore phenomena witnessed with
1061,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"their eyes, or disregard conclusions arrived at by the exercise of their"
1062,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,reasoning powers.
1063,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
1064,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"The champions of orthodoxy having become alarmed, an appeal was made to"
1065,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,the ecclesiastical authorities to assist in suppressing this recent
1066,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"astronomical heresy, and other obnoxious doctrines, the authorship of"
1067,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,which was ascribed to Galileo.
1068,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
1069,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"In 1615, Galileo was summoned before the Inquisition to reply to the"
1070,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,accusation of heresy. 'He was charged with maintaining the motion of the
1071,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Earth and the stability of the Sun; with teaching this doctrine to his
1072,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,pupils; with corresponding on the subject with several German
1073,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"mathematicians; and with having published it, and attempted to reconcile"
1074,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,it to Scripture in his letters to Mark Velser in 1612.'
1075,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
1076,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"These charges having been formally investigated by the Inquisition,"
1077,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Cardinal Bellarmine was authorised to communicate with Galileo, and"
1078,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"inform him that unless he renounced the obnoxious doctrines, and"
1079,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"promised 'neither to teach, defend, or publish them in future,' it was"
1080,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,decreed that he should be committed to prison. Galileo appeared next day
1081,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"before the Cardinal, and, without any hesitation, pledged himself that"
1082,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,for the future he would adhere to the pronouncement of the Inquisition.
1083,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
1084,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Having, as they imagined, silenced Galileo, the Inquisition resolved to"
1085,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,condemn the entire Copernican system as heretical; and in order to
1086,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"effectually accomplish this, besides condemning the writings of Galileo,"
1087,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"they inhibited Kepler's 'Epitome of the Copernican System,' and"
1088,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Copernicus's own work, 'De Revolutionibus Orbium Celestium.'"
1089,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
1090,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Whether it was that Galileo regarded the Inquisition as a body whose
1091,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"decrees were too absurd and unreasonable to be heeded, or that he"
1092,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,dreaded the consequences which might have followed had he remained
1093,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"obstinate, we know that, notwithstanding the pledges which he gave, he"
1094,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,was soon afterwards engaged in controversial discussion on those
1095,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,subjects which he promised not to mention again.
1096,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
1097,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,On the accession of his friend Cardinal Barberini to the pontifical
1098,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"throne in 1623, under the title of Urban VIII., Galileo undertook a"
1099,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,journey to Rome to offer him his congratulations upon his elevation to
1100,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,the papal chair. He was received by his Holiness with marked attention
1101,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"and kindness, was granted several prolonged audiences, and had conferred"
1102,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,upon him several valuable gifts.
1103,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
1104,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Notwithstanding the kindness of Pope Urban and the leniency with which
1105,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"he was treated by the Inquisition, Galileo, having ignored his pledge,"
1106,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"published in 1632 a book, in dialogue form, in which three persons were"
1107,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,supposed to express their scientific opinions. The first upheld the
1108,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Copernican theory and the more recent philosophical views; the second
1109,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"person adopted a neutral position, suggested doubts, and made remarks of"
1110,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"an amusing nature; the third individual, called Simplicio, was a"
1111,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"believer in Ptolemy and Aristotle, and based his arguments upon the"
1112,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,philosophy of the ancients.
1113,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
1114,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"As soon as this work became publicly known, the enemies of Galileo"
1115,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,persuaded the Pope that the third person held up to ridicule was
1116,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,intended as a representation of himself--an individual regardless of
1117,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"scientific truth, and firmly attached to the ideas and opinions"
1118,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,associated with the writings of antiquity.
1119,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
1120,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,Almost immediately after the publication of the 'Dialogues' Galileo was
1121,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"summoned before the Inquisition, and, notwithstanding his feeble health"
1122,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"and the infirmities of advanced age, he was, after a long and tedious"
1123,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"trial, condemned to abjure by oath on his knees his scientific beliefs."
1124,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
1125,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,'The ceremony of Galileo's abjuration was one of exciting interest and
1126,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"of awful formality. Clothed in the sackcloth of a repentant criminal,"
1127,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"the venerable sage fell upon his knees before the assembled cardinals,"
1128,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"and, laying his hand upon the Holy Evangelists, he invoked the Divine"
1129,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"aid in abjuring, and detesting, and vowing never again to teach the"
1130,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,doctrines of the Earth's motion and of the Sun's stability. He pledged
1131,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"himself that he would nevermore, either in words or in writing,"
1132,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,propagate such heresies; and he swore that he would fulfil and observe

1137,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
1138,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Galileo's sarcasm, and the bitterness which he imparted into his"
1139,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"controversies, were more the cause of his misfortunes than his"
1140,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,scientific beliefs. When he became involved in difficulties he did not
1141,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,possess the moral courage to enable him to abide by the consequences of
1142,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"his acts; nor did he care to become a martyr for the sake of science,"
1143,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,his submission to the Inquisition having probably saved him from a fate
1144,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,similar to what befell Bruno. Though it would be impossible to justify
1145,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Galileo's want of faith in his dealings with the Inquisition, yet one"
1146,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"cannot help sympathising deeply with the aged philosopher, who, in this"
1147,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"painful episode of his life, was compelled to go through the form of"
1148,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,making a retractation of his beliefs under circumstances of a most
1149,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,humiliating nature.
1150,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
1151,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,But the persecution of Galileo did not delay the progress of scientific
1152,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"inquiry nor retard the advancement of the Copernican theory, which,"
1153,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"after the discovery by Newton of the law of gravitation, was universally"
1154,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,adopted as the true theory of the solar system.

1156,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Ferdinand, Duke of Tuscany, having exerted his influence with Pope Urban"
1157,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"on behalf of Galileo, he was, after a few days' incarceration, released"
1158,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"from prison, and permission was given him to reside at Siena, where he"
1159,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,remained for six months. He was afterwards allowed to return to his
1160,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"villa at Arcetri, and, though regarded as a prisoner of the Inquisition,"
1161,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,was permitted to pursue his studies unmolested for the remainder of his

1166,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
1167,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"Though not the inventor, he was the first to construct a refracting"
1168,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,telescope and apply it to astronomical research. With this instrument
1169,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,he made a number of important discoveries which tended to confirm his
1170,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,belief in the truthfulness of the Copernican theory.
1171,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,
1172,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"On directing his telescope to the Sun, he discovered movable spots on"
1173,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"his disc, and concluded from his observation of them that the orb"
1174,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,rotated on his axis in about twenty-eight days. He also ascertained that
1175,A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH OF ASTRONOMY,"the Moon's illumination is due to reflected sunlight, and that her"

1215,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1216,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,The seventeenth century embraces the most remarkable epoch in the whole
1217,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,history of astronomy. It was during this period that those wonderful
1218,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,discoveries were made which have been the means of raising astronomy to
1219,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,the lofty position which it now occupies among the sciences. The
1220,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,unrivalled genius and patient labours of the illustrious men whose names
1221,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,stand out in such prominence on the written pages of the history of this
1222,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,era have rendered it one of the most interesting and elevating of
1223,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"studies. Though Copernicus lived in the preceding century, yet the names"
1224,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"of Tycho Brahé, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton, testify to the greatness of"
1225,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"the discoveries that were made during this period, which have surrounded"
1226,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,the memories of those men with a lustre of undying fame.
1227,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1228,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Foremost among astronomers of less conspicuous eminence who made
1229,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,important discoveries in this century we find the name of Huygens.
1230,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1231,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,CHRISTIAN HUYGENS was born at The Hague in 1629. He was the second son
1232,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"of Constantine Huygens, an eminent diplomatist, and secretary to the"
1233,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Prince of Orange. Huygens studied at Leyden and Breda, and became"
1234,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,highly distinguished as a geometrician and scientist. He made important
1235,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"investigations relative to the figure of the Earth, and wrote a learned"
1236,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,treatise on the cause of gravity; he also determined with greater
1237,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,accuracy investigations made by Galileo regarding the accelerated motion
1238,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,of bodies when subjected to the influence of that force.
1239,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1240,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Huygens admitted that the planets and their satellites attracted each
1241,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,other with a force varying according to the inverse ratio of the squares
1242,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"of their distances, but rejected the mutual attraction of the molecules"
1243,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"of matter, believing that they possessed gravity towards a central point"
1244,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"only, to which they were attracted. This supposition was at variance"
1245,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"with the Newtonian theory, which, however, was universally regarded as"
1246,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,the correct one.
1247,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1248,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Huygens originated the theory by which it is believed that light is
1249,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,produced by the undulatory vibration of the ether; he also discovered
1250,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,polarization.
1251,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1252,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Up to this time the method adopted in the construction of clocks was not
1253,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,capable of producing a mechanism which measured time with sufficient
1254,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,accuracy to satisfy the requirements of astronomers. Huygens endeavoured
1255,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"to supply this want, and applied his mechanical ingenuity in"
1256,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,constructing a clock that could be relied upon to keep accurate time.
1257,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Though the pendulum motion was first adopted by Galileo, he was unable"
1258,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,to arrange its mechanism so that it should keep up a continuous
1259,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"movement. The oscillation of the pendulum ceased after a time, and a"
1260,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"fresh impulse had to be applied to set it in motion. Consequently,"
1261,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Galileo's clock was of no service as a timekeeper.
1262,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1263,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Huygens overcame this difficulty by so arranging the mechanism of his
1264,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"clock that the balance, instead of being horizontal, was directed"
1265,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"perpendicularly, and prolonged downwards to form a pendulum, the"
1266,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,oscillations of which regulated the downward motion of the weight. This
1267,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"invention, which was highly applauded, proved to be of great service"
1268,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"everywhere, and was especially valuable for astronomical purposes."
1269,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1270,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Huygens next directed his attention to the construction of telescopes,"
1271,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,and displayed much skill in the grinding and polishing of lenses. He
1272,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,made several instruments superior in power and accuracy to any that
1273,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"existed previously, and with one of these made some remarkable"
1274,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,discoveries when observing the planet Saturn.
1275,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1276,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,The telescopic appearance of Saturn is one of the most beautiful in the
1277,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"heavens. The planet, surrounded by two brilliant rings, and accompanied"
1278,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"by eight attendant moons, surpasses all the other orbs of the firmament"
1279,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"as an object of interest and admiration. To the naked eye, Saturn is"
1280,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"visible as a star of the first magnitude, and was known to the ancients"
1281,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,as the most remote of the planets. Travelling in space at a distance of
1282,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"nearly one thousand millions of miles from the Sun, the planet"
1283,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,accomplishes a revolution of its mighty orbit in twenty-nine and a half
1284,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,years.
1285,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1286,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Galileo was the first astronomer who directed a telescope to Saturn. He
1287,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"observed that the planet presented a triform appearance, and that on"
1288,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"each side of the central globe there were two objects, in close contact"
1289,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"with it, which caused it to assume an ovoid shape. After further"
1290,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"observation, Galileo perceived that the lateral bodies gradually"
1291,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"decreased in size, until they became invisible. At the expiration of a"
1292,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"certain period of time they reappeared, and were observed to go through"
1293,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,a certain cycle of changes. By the application of increased telescopic
1294,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"power it was discovered that the appendages were not of a rounded form,"
1295,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"but appeared as two small crescents, having their concave surfaces"
1296,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"directed towards the planet and their extremities in contact with it,"
1297,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,resembling the manner in which the handles are attached to a cup.
1298,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1299,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,These objects were observed to go through a series of periodic changes.
1300,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"After having become invisible, they reappeared as two luminous straight"
1301,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"bands, projecting from each side of the planet; during the next seven or"
1302,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"eight years they gradually opened out, and assumed a crescentic form;"
1303,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"they afterwards began to contract, and on the expiration of a similar"
1304,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"period, during which time they gradually decreased in size, they again"
1305,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,became invisible. It was perceived that the appendages completed a cycle
1306,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,of their changes in about fifteen years.
1307,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1308,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"In 1656, Huygens, with a telescope constructed by himself, was enabled"
1309,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,to solve the enigma which for so many years baffled the efforts of the
1310,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,ablest astronomers. He announced his discovery in the form of a Latin
1311,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"cryptograph which, when deciphered, read as follows:--"
1312,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1313,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"'Annulo cingitur, tenui plano, nusquam cohaerente, ad eclipticam"
1314,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,inclinatio.'
1315,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1316,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,'The planet is surrounded by a slender flat ring everywhere distinct
1317,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"from its surface, and inclined to the ecliptic.'"
1318,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1319,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Huygens perceived the shadow of the ring thrown on the planet, and was"
1320,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,able to account in a satisfactory manner for all the phenomena observed
1321,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,in connection with its variable appearance.
1322,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1323,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"The true form of the ring is circular, but by us it is seen"
1324,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"foreshortened; consequently, when the Earth is above or below its plane,"
1325,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,it appears of an elliptical shape. When the position of the planet is
1326,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"such that the plane of the ring passes through the Sun, the edge of the"
1327,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"ring only is illumined, and then it becomes invisible for a short"
1328,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"period. In the same manner, when the plane of the ring passes through"
1329,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"the Earth, the illumined edge of the ring is not of sufficient magnitude"
1330,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"to appear visible, but as the enlightened side of the plane becomes more"
1331,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"inclined towards the Earth, the ring comes again into view. When the"
1332,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"plane of the ring passes between the Earth and the Sun, the unillumined"
1333,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"side of the ring is turned towards the Earth, and during the time it"
1334,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,remains in this position it is invisible.

1339,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"JOHANN HEVELIUS, a celebrated Prussian astronomer, was born at Dantzig"
1340,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"in 1611, and died in that city in 1687. He was a man of wealth, and"
1341,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"erected an observatory at his residence, where, for a period of forty"
1342,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"years, he carried out a series of astronomical observations."
1343,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1344,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"He constructed a chart of the stars, and in order to complete his work,"
1345,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,formed nine new constellations in those spaces in the celestial vault
1346,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,which were previously un-named. They are known by the names

1348,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Monoceros, Sextans, and Vulpecula. He also executed a chart of the"
1349,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Moon's surface, wrote a description of the lunar spots, and discovered"

1352,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"On May 30, 1661, Hevelius observed a transit of Mercury, a description"
1353,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"of which he published, and included with it Horrox's treatise on the"
1354,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"first-recorded transit of Venus. This work, after having passed through"
1355,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"several hands, became the property of Hevelius, who was capable of"
1356,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"appreciating its merits. The manuscript was sent to him by Huygens, and"
1357,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,in acknowledging it he writes: 'How greatly does my Mercury exult in the

1375,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1376,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"In 1644 Cassini proved beyond doubt that Jupiter rotated on his axis,"
1377,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,and also assigned his period of rotation with considerable accuracy. He
1378,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"published tables of the planet's satellites, and determined their"
1379,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,motions from observations of their eclipses. He ascertained the periods
1380,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"of rotation of Venus and Mars; executed a chart of the lunar surface,"
1381,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,and observed an occultation of Jupiter by the Moon.
1382,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1383,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Cassini discovered the dual nature of Saturn's ring, having perceived"
1384,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,that instead of one there are two concentric rings separated by a dark
1385,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"space. He also discovered four of the planet's satellites--viz. Japetus,"
1386,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Rhea, Dione, and Tethys. He made a near approximation to the solar"
1387,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"parallax by means of researches on the parallax of Mars, and"
1388,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,investigated some irregularities of the Moon's motion. Cassini
1389,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"discovered the belts of Jupiter, and also the Zodiacal Light, and"
1390,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,established the coincidence of the nodes of the lunar equator and orbit.
1391,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1392,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"JAQUES CASSINI, son of Giovanni, was born at Paris in 1677. He followed"
1393,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"in his father's footsteps, and wrote several treatises on astronomical"

1395,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"axis, and upheld the results arrived at by his father, which were"
1396,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,afterwards confirmed by observations made by Schroeter. Cassini made
1397,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"some valuable researches with regard to the proper motion of the stars,"
1398,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,and demonstrated that their change of position on the celestial vault
1399,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"was real, and not caused by a displacement of the ecliptic. He attempted"
1400,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"to ascertain the apparent diameter of Sirius, and made observations with"

1415,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"and took up his residence in the French capital, where he continued to"
1416,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,prosecute his astronomical studies.
1417,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1418,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"In 1675 Roemer communicated to the Academy of Sciences a paper, in which"
1419,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,he announced his discovery of the progressive transmission of light. It
1420,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"was believed that light travelled instantaneously, but Roemer was able"
1421,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"to demonstrate the inaccuracy of this conclusion, and determined that"
1422,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,light travels through space with a measurable velocity.
1423,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1424,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"By diligently observing the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites, Roemer"
1425,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"perceived that sometimes they occurred before, and sometimes after their"
1426,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"predicted times. This irregularity, he discovered, depended upon the"
1427,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"position of the Earth with regard to Jupiter. When the Earth, in"
1428,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"traversing her orbit, moved round to the opposite side of the Sun,"
1429,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"thereby bringing Jupiter into conjunction, an eclipse occurred sixteen"
1430,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,minutes twenty-six seconds later than it did when Jupiter was in
1431,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,opposition or nearest to the Earth. As there existed an impression that
1432,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"light travelled instantaneously, it was believed that an eclipse"
1433,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"occurred at the moment it was perceived in the telescope. This, however,"
1434,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"was not so. Roemer, after a long series of observations, concluded that"
1435,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,the discrepancies were due to the fact that light travels with a
1436,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"measurable velocity, and that it requires a greater length of time,"
1437,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"upwards of sixteen minutes, to traverse the additional distance--the"
1438,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,diameter of the Earth's orbit--which intervenes between the Earth and
1439,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Jupiter, when the planet is in conjunction, as compared with the"
1440,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"distance between the Earth and Jupiter, when the latter is in"
1441,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,opposition. This discovery of Roemer's was the means of enabling the
1442,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"velocity of light to be ascertained, which, according to recent"
1443,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"calculations, is about 187,000 miles a second. As an acknowledgment of"
1444,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"the importance of his communication, Roemer was awarded a seat in the"
1445,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Academy, and apartments were assigned to him at the Royal Observatory,"
1446,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,where he carried on his astronomical studies.
1447,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1448,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"In 1681 Roemer returned to Denmark, and was appointed Professor of"
1449,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Mathematics in the University of Copenhagen; he was also entrusted with
1450,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,the care of the city observatory--a duty which his reputation as an
1451,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,astronomer eminently qualified him to undertake. The transit
1452,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,instrument--a mechanism of much importance to astronomers--was invented
1453,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,by Roemer in 1690; it consists of a telescope fixed to a horizontal
1454,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"axis, and adjusted so as to revolve in the plane of the meridian. It is"
1455,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,employed in observing the passage of the heavenly bodies across the
1456,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,observer's meridian. To note accurately by means of the astronomical
1457,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,clock the exact instant of time at which a celestial body crosses the
1458,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,centre of the field of view is the essential part of a transit
1459,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,observation. Small transit instruments are employed for taking the time
1460,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"and for regulating the observatory clock, but large instruments are"
1461,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,used for delicate and exact observations of Right Ascensions and
1462,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Declinations of stars of different magnitudes. Meridian, and altitude"
1463,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"and azimuth circles, are important astronomical appliances, which owe"
1464,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,their existence to the inventive skill of this distinguished astronomer.
1465,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1466,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Roemer resided for many years at the observatory in the city of
1467,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Copenhagen, where he pursued his astronomical studies until the time of"
1468,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"his death, which occurred in 1710. He meritoriously attempted to"
1469,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,determine the parallax of the fixed stars; and it is said that the
1470,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,astronomical calculations and observations which he left behind him were
1471,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"so voluminous as to equal in number those made by Tycho Brahé, nearly"
1472,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,all of which perished in a great conflagration that destroyed the
1473,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,observatory and a large portion of the city of Copenhagen in 1728.
1474,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1475,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Among other astronomers of this century whose names deserve recording
1476,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"were Descartes and Gassendi, whose mathematical researches in their"
1477,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"application to astronomy were of much value; Fabricius, Torricelli, and"
1478,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Maraldi, who by their observations and investigations added many facts"
1479,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"to the general knowledge of the science; and Bayer, to whom belongs the"
1480,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,distinction of having constructed the first star-atlas.
1481,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1482,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,In our own country during this period astronomy was cultivated by a few
1483,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"enthusiastic men, who devoted their time and talents to promoting the"
1484,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"advancement of the science. It, however, received no recognition as a"
1485,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"subject of study at any of the Universities, and no public observatory"
1486,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,existed in Great Britain.
1487,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1488,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Though it was not until towards the close of the century that the
1489,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,attention of all Europe was directed to England in admiration of the
1490,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"discoveries of the illustrious Newton, yet astronomy had its humble"
1491,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"votaries, and chief among those was a young clergyman of the name of"
1492,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Horrox.
1493,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1494,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"JEREMIAH HORROX was born at Toxteth, near Liverpool, in 1619--close on"
1495,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,three centuries ago. Little is known of his family. His parents have
1496,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"been described as persons who occupied a humble position in life, but,"
1497,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,as they were able to give their son a classical education which fitted
1498,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"him for one of the learned professions, it is probable they were not so"
1499,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,obscure as they have been represented to be.
1500,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1501,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Having received his early education at Toxteth, Horrox afterwards"
1502,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"proceeded to Cambridge, and was entered as a student at Emmanuel College"
1503,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"on May 18, 1632, when in his fourteenth year."
1504,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1505,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"At the University he devoted himself to the study of classics,"
1506,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"especially Latin, which in those days was the language adopted by men of"
1507,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"learning, when engaged in writing works of a philosophical and"
1508,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,scientific character.
1509,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1510,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"After having remained at Cambridge for three years, Horrox returned to"
1511,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"his native county, and was appointed curate of Hoole, a place about"
1512,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,eight miles distant from Preston. Hoole is described as a narrow
1513,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"low-lying strip of land consisting largely of moss, and almost converted"
1514,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"into an island by the waters of Martin Mere on the south, and the Ribble"
1515,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"on the north; and, though doubtless an open and favourable situation for"
1516,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"astronomical observation, it could not have been attractive as a place"
1517,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"of residence. Yet it was here on November 24, 1639, that Horrox made his"
1518,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"famous observation of the first recorded transit of Venus, an occurrence"
1519,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,with which his name will be for ever associated.
1520,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1521,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,It was while at Cambridge that Horrox first turned his attention to the
1522,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"study of astronomy. His love of the sublime, and the captivating"
1523,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,influence exerted on his mind by the contemplation of the heavenly
1524,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"bodies, induced him to adopt astronomy as a pursuit congenial to his"
1525,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"tastes, and capable of exercising his highest mental powers. Having this"
1526,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"object in view, he applied himself with much earnestness to the study of"
1527,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"mathematics; he had, however, to rely mainly upon his own exertions, for"
1528,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,at that time no branch of physical or mathematical science was taught at
1529,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Cambridge, and consequently he obtained no professional instruction."
1530,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1531,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"It was so also with astronomy, which, as a science, was scarcely known"
1532,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,in this country; no regular record of astronomical observations was kept
1533,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"by any individual observer, and no public observatory existed in England"
1534,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,or in France.
1535,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1536,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,The disadvantages and obstacles which Horrox had to encounter may be
1537,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,best described by quoting his own words. He writes: 'There were many
1538,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"hindrances. The abstruse nature of the study, my inexperience and want"
1539,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,of means dispirited me. I was much pained not to have any one to whom I
1540,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"could look for guidance, or indeed for the sympathy of companionship in"
1541,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"my endeavours, and I was assailed by the languor and weariness which are"
1542,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,inseparable from every great undertaking. What then was to be done? I
1543,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"could not make the pursuit an easy one, much less increase my fortune,"
1544,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,and least of all imbue others with a love for astronomy; and yet to
1545,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,complain of philosophy on account of its difficulties would be foolish
1546,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"and unworthy. I determined, therefore, that the tediousness of study"
1547,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,should be overcome by industry; my poverty--failing a better method--by
1548,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,patience; and that instead of a master I would use astronomical books.
1549,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Armed with these weapons I would contend successfully; and, having heard"
1550,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"of others acquiring knowledge without greater help, I would blush that"
1551,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"any one should be able to do more than I, always remembering that word"
1552,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,of Virgil's--
1553,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1554,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Totidem nobis animaeque manusque.
1555,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1556,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Having heard much praise bestowed upon the works of Lansberg, a Flemish"
1557,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"astronomer, Horrox thought it would be to his advantage to procure a"
1558,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,copy of his writings. This he succeeded in obtaining after some
1559,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"difficulty, and devoted a considerable time to calculating Ephemerides,"
1560,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"based upon the Lansberg Tables, but after making a number of"
1561,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,computations he discovered that they were unreliable and inaccurate.
1562,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1563,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"In the year 1636 Horrox made the acquaintance of William Crabtree, a"
1564,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"devoted astronomer, who lived at Broughton, a suburb of Manchester. A"
1565,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"close friendship soon existed between the two men, and they carried on"
1566,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,an active correspondence about matters relating to the science which
1567,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,they both loved so well.
1568,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1569,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Crabtree, who was an unbeliever in Lansberg, urged Horrox to discard the"
1570,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Flemish astronomer's works, and devote his talents to the study of Tycho"
1571,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Brahé and Kepler. This advice led Horrox to make a more rigorous
1572,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"examination of the Lansberg Tables, and after comparing them with the"
1573,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"observations made by Crabtree, which coincided with his own, he resolved"
1574,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"to renounce them. Acting on the advice of his friend, Horrox directed"
1575,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,his attention to the writings of Kepler. The youthful astronomer soon
1576,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"realised their value, and was charmed with the accuracy of observation"
1577,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,and inductive reasoning displayed in the elucidation of those general
1578,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,laws which constituted a new era in the history of astronomy.
1579,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1580,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"The Rudolphine Tables, which were the astronomical calculations"
1581,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"commenced by Tycho Brahé, and completed by Kepler, were regarded by"
1582,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Horrox as much superior to those of Lansberg; but it occurred to him
1583,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"that they might be improved by changing some of the numbers, and yet"
1584,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,retaining the hypotheses. To this task he applied himself with much
1585,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"earnestness and assiduity, and after close application and laborious"
1586,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,study he accomplished the arduous undertaking of bringing those tables
1587,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,to a high state of perfection.
1588,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1589,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"In his investigation of the Lunar theory, Horrox outstripped all his"
1590,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"predecessors, and Sir Isaac Newton distinctly affirms he was the first"
1591,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,to discover that the Moon's motion round the Earth is in the form of an
1592,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,ellipse with the centre in the lower focus. Besides having made this
1593,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"discovery, Horrox was able to explain the causes of the inequalities of"
1594,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"the Moon's motion, which render the exact computation of her elements so"
1595,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,difficult.
1596,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1597,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"The Annual Equation, an irregularity discovered by Tycho Brahé, which is"
1598,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,produced by the increase and decrease of the Sun's disturbing force as
1599,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"the Earth approaches or recedes from him in her orbit, had its value"
1600,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,first assigned by Horrox. This he calculated to be eleven minutes
1601,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"sixteen seconds, which is within four seconds of what it has since been"
1602,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,proved to be by the most recent observations.
1603,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1604,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"The Evection, an irregular motion of the Moon discovered by Ptolemy,"
1605,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"whereby her mean longitude is increased or diminished, was explained by"
1606,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Horrox as depending upon the libratory motion of the apsides, and the"
1607,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,change which takes place in the eccentricity of the lunar orbit.
1608,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1609,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,These discoveries were made by Horrox before he attained the age of
1610,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"twenty years, and if his reputation had alone rested upon them his name"
1611,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,would have been honourably associated with those who have attained to
1612,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,the highest eminence in astronomy.
1613,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1614,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Another achievement which adds lustre to Horrox's name consists in his
1615,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,detection of the inequality in the mean motions of Jupiter and Saturn.
1616,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1617,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"He also directed his attention to the study of cometary bodies, and"
1618,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,arrived at certain conclusions with regard to the nature of their
1619,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"movements. At first, he believed like Kepler that comets were projected"
1620,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,in straight lines from the Sun; this supposition having been upheld on
1621,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,account of the great elongation of their orbits. He next perceived that
1622,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"their velocity increased as they approached the Sun, and decreased as"
1623,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"they receded from him. Afterwards he says, 'They move in an elliptic"
1624,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"figure or near it,' and finally he arrived at the conclusion that"
1625,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"'comets move in elliptical orbits, being carried round the Sun with a"
1626,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,velocity which is probably variable.' This theory has been verified by
1627,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"numerous observations, and is now generally accepted by astronomers."
1628,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1629,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Horrox also made a series of observations on the tides. He notified the
1630,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"extent of their rise and fall at different periods, and investigated"
1631,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,other phenomena associated with their ebb and flow. After having
1632,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"continued his observations for some time, he wrote to his friend"
1633,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Crabtree, and informed him that he had perceived many interesting"
1634,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"details which had not been previously described, and he hoped to be"
1635,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,able to arrive at some important conclusions with regard to their nature
1636,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"and cause. Unfortunately, Horrox's writings on this subject, along with"
1637,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"many other important papers, have been lost or destroyed. We are"
1638,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"therefore ignorant of the result of his researches, which were the first"
1639,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,undertaken by any person for the purpose of scientific inquiry.
1640,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1641,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"From his study of the Lansberg and Rudolphine Tables, Horrox arrived at"
1642,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"the conclusion that a transit of Venus would occur on November 24, 1639."
1643,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"This transit was for some unaccountable reason overlooked by Kepler, who"
1644,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"predicted one in 1631, and the next not until 1761. The transit of 1631"
1645,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,was not visible in Europe.
1646,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1647,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,We are indebted to Horrox for a description of the transit of 1639--the
1648,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,first that was ever observed of which there is any record; and were it
1649,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"not for the accuracy of his calculations, the occurrence of the"
1650,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"phenomenon would have been unperceived, and no history of the"
1651,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,conjunction would have been handed down to posterity. As soon as Horrox
1652,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"had assured himself of the time when the transit would take place, he"
1653,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"wrote to Crabtree to inform him of the date, and asked him to make"
1654,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"observations with his telescope, and especially to examine the diameter"
1655,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"of the planet, which he thought had been over-estimated. He also"
1656,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"requested him to write to Dr. Foster of Cambridge, and inform him of the"
1657,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"expected event, as it was desirable that the transit should be observed"
1658,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"from several places in consequence of the possibility of failure, owing"
1659,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"to an overcast sky. His letter is dated October 26, 1639. He says: 'My"
1660,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,reason for now writing is to advise you of a remarkable conjunction of
1661,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"the Sun and Venus on the 24th of November, when there will be a transit."
1662,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"As such a thing has not happened for many years past, and will not occur"
1663,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"again in this century, I earnestly entreat you to watch attentively with"
1664,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,your telescope in order to observe it as well as you can.
1665,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1666,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"'Notice particularly the diameter of Venus, which is stated by Kepler to"
1667,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"be seven minutes, and by Lansberg to be eleven, but which I believe to"
1668,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,be scarcely greater than one minute.'
1669,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1670,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"In describing the method which he adopted for observing the transit,"
1671,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Horrox writes as follows: 'Having attentively examined Venus with my
1672,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"instrument, I described on a sheet of paper a circle, whose diameter was"
1673,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,nearly equal to six inches--the narrowness of the apartment not
1674,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,permitting me conveniently to use a larger size. I divided the
1675,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"circumference of this circle into 360 degrees in the usual manner, and"
1676,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"its diameter into thirty equal parts, which gives about as many minutes"
1677,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,as are equivalent to the Sun's apparent diameter. Each of these thirty
1678,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"parts was again divided into four equal portions, making in all one"
1679,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"hundred and twenty; and these, if necessary, may be more minutely"
1680,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"subdivided. The rest I left to ocular computation, which, in such small"
1681,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"sections, is quite as certain as any mechanical division. Suppose,"
1682,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"then, each of these thirty parts to be divided into sixty seconds,"
1683,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,according to the practice of astronomers. When the time of the
1684,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"observation approached, I retired to my apartment, and, having closed"
1685,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"the windows against the light, I directed my telescope--previously"
1686,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"adjusted to a focus--through the aperture towards the Sun, and received"
1687,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,his rays at right angles upon the paper already mentioned. The Sun's
1688,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"image exactly filled the circle, and I watched carefully and unceasingly"
1689,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,for any dark body that might enter upon the disc of light.
1690,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1691,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,'Although the corrected computation of Venus' motions which I had before
1692,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"prepared, and on the accuracy of which I implicitly relied, forbade me"
1693,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"to expect anything before three o'clock in the afternoon of the 24th,"
1694,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"yet since, according to the calculations of most astronomers, the"
1695,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,conjunction should take place sooner--by some even on the 23rd--I was
1696,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"unwilling to depend entirely on my own opinion, which was not"
1697,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"sufficiently confirmed, lest by too much self-confidence I might"
1698,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"endanger the observation. Anxiously intent, therefore, on the"
1699,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"undertaking through the greater part of the 23rd, and on the whole of"
1700,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"the 24th, I omitted no available opportunity of observing her ingress. I"
1701,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"watched carefully on the 24th from sunrise to nine o'clock, and from a"
1702,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"little before ten until noon, and at one in the afternoon, being called"
1703,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"away in the intervals by business of the highest importance, which for"
1704,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,these ornamental pursuits I could not with propriety neglect.[3] But
1705,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,during all this time I saw nothing in the Sun except a small and common
1706,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"spot, consisting as it were of three points at a distance from the"
1707,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"centre towards the left, which I noticed on the preceding and following"
1708,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,days. This evidently had nothing to do with Venus. About fifteen minutes
1709,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"past three in the afternoon, when I was again at liberty to continue my"
1710,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"labours, the clouds, as if by divine interposition, were entirely"
1711,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"dispersed, and I was once more invited to the grateful task of repeating"
1712,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,my observations. I then beheld a most agreeable spectacle--the object of
1713,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,my sanguine wishes; a spot of unusual magnitude and of a perfectly
1714,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"circular shape, which had already fully entered upon the Sun's disc on"
1715,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"the left, so that the limbs of the Sun and Venus precisely coincided,"
1716,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,forming an angle of contact. Not doubting that this was really the
1717,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"shadow of the planet, I immediately applied myself sedulously to observe"
1718,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,it.
1719,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1720,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"'In the first place, with respect to the inclination, the line of the"
1721,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"diameter of the circle being perpendicular to the horizon, although its"
1722,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"plane was somewhat inclined on account of the Sun's altitude, I found"
1723,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"that the shadow of Venus at the aforesaid hour--namely, fifteen minutes"
1724,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"past three--had entered the Sun's disc about 62° 30´, certainly between"
1725,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"60° and 65°, from the top towards the right. This was the appearance in"
1726,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"the dark apartment; therefore, out of doors, beneath the open sky,"
1727,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"according to the laws of optics, the contrary would be the case, and"
1728,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Venus would be below the centre of the Sun, distant 62° 30´ from the"
1729,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"lower limbs or the nadir, as the Arabians term it. The inclination"
1730,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"remained to all appearances the same until sunset, when the observation"
1731,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,was concluded.
1732,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1733,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"'In the second place, the distance between the centres of Venus and the"
1734,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Sun I found by three observations to be as follows:--
1735,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1736,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,The Hour.          | Distance of the Centres.
1737,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,|
1738,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,At 3·15 by the clock         |        14´ 24´´
1739,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,""" 3·35      ""               |        13´ 30´´"
1740,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,""" 3·45      ""               |        13´  0´´"
1741,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,""" 3·50 the apparent sunset. |"
1742,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1743,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"The true setting being 3·45, and the apparent about 5 minutes later, the"
1744,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,difference being caused by refraction. The clock therefore was
1745,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,sufficiently correct.
1746,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1747,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,'In the third place I found after careful and repeated observation that
1748,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"the diameter of Venus, as her shadow was depicted on the paper, was"
1749,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"larger indeed than the thirtieth part of the solar diameter, though not"
1750,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"more so than the sixth, or at the utmost the fifth of such a part."
1751,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Therefore let the diameter of the Sun be to the diameter of Venus as 30´
1752,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"to 1´ 12´´. Certainly her diameter never equalled 1´ 30´´, scarcely"
1753,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"perhaps 1´ 20´´, and this was evident as well when the planet was near"
1754,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,the Sun's limb as when far distant from it.

1756,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,[Illustration: VENUS ON THE SUN'S DISC.]
1757,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1758,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,'This observation was made in an obscure village where I have long been
1759,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"in the habit of observing, about fifteen miles to the north of"
1760,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Liverpool, the latitude of which I believe to be 53° 20´, although by"
1761,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"common maps it is stated at 54° 12´, therefore the latitude of the"
1762,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"village will be 53° 35´, and longitude of both 22° 30´ from the"
1763,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Fortunate Islands, now called the Canaries. This is 14° 15´ to the west"
1764,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"of Uraniburg in Denmark, the longitude of which is stated by Brahé, a"
1765,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"native of the place, to be 36° 45´ from these islands."
1766,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1767,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,'This is all I could observe respecting this celebrated conjunction
1768,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,during the short time the Sun remained in the horizon: for although
1769,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Venus continued on his disc for several hours, she was not visible to me"
1770,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,longer than half an hour on account of his so quickly setting.
1771,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Nevertheless, all the observations which could possibly be made in so"
1772,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,short a time I was enabled by Divine Providence to complete so
1773,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,effectually that I could scarcely have wished for a more extended
1774,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,period. The inclination was the only point upon which I failed to attain
1775,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"the utmost precision; for, owing to the rapid motion of the Sun it was"
1776,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"difficult to observe with certainty to a single degree, and I frankly"
1777,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,confess that I neither did nor could ascertain it. But all the rest is
1778,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"sufficiently accurate, and as exact as I could desire.'"
1779,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1780,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Besides having ascertained that the diameter of Venus subtends an angle
1781,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"not much greater than one minute of arc, Horrox reduced the horizontal"
1782,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,solar parallax from fifty-seven seconds as stated by Kepler to fourteen
1783,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"seconds, a calculation within one and a half second of the value"
1784,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,assigned to it by Halley sixty years after. He also reduced the Sun's
1785,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,semi-diameter.
1786,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1787,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Crabtree, to whom Horrox refers as 'his most esteemed friend and a"
1788,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"person who has few superiors in mathematical learning,' made"
1789,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,preparations to observe the transit similar to those already described.
1790,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"But the day was unfavourable, dark clouds obscured the sky and rendered"
1791,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"the Sun invisible. Crabtree was in despair, and relinquished all hope of"
1792,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"being able to witness the conjunction. However, just before sunset there"
1793,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"was a break in the clouds, and the Sun shone brilliantly for a short"
1794,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"interval. Crabtree at once seized his opportunity, and to his intense"
1795,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,delight observed the planet fully entered upon the Sun's disc. Instead
1796,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"of proceeding to take observations, he was so overcome with emotion at"
1797,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"the sight of the phenomenon, that he continued to gaze upon it with rapt"
1798,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"attention, nor did he recover his self-possession until the clouds again"
1799,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,hid from his view the setting Sun.[4]
1800,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1801,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Crabtree's observation of the transit was, however, not a fruitless one."
1802,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,He drew from memory a diagram showing the exact position of Venus on the
1803,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Sun's disc, which corresponded in every respect with Horrox's"
1804,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,observation; he also estimated the diameter of the planet to be 7/200
1805,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"that of the Sun, which when calculated gives one minute three seconds;"
1806,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Horrox having found it to be one minute twelve seconds. This transit of
1807,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Venus is remarkable as having been the first ever observed of which
1808,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"there is any record, and for this we are indebted to the genius of"
1809,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Horrox, who by a series of calculations, displaying a wonderfully"
1810,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"accurate knowledge of mathematics, was enabled to predict the occurrence"
1811,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"of the phenomenon on the very day, and almost at the hour it appeared,"
1812,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,and of which he and his friend Crabtree were the only observers.
1813,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1814,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Having thought it desirable to write an account of the transit, Horrox"
1815,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"prepared an elegant Latin treatise, entitled 'Venus in Sole"
1816,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Visa'--'Venus seen in the Sun;' but not knowing what steps to take with
1817,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"regard to its publication, he requested Crabtree to communicate with his"
1818,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,bookseller and obtain his advice on the matter.
1819,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1820,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"In the meantime Horrox returned to Toxteth, and arranged to fulfil a"
1821,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"long-promised visit to Crabtree, which he looked forward to with much"
1822,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"pleasure, as it would afford him an opportunity of discussing with his"
1823,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,friend many matters of interest to both. This visit was frustrated in a
1824,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,manner altogether unexpected. For we read that Horrox was seized with a
1825,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"sudden and severe illness, the nature of which is not known, and that"
1826,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,his death occurred on the day previous to that of his intended visit to
1827,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"his friend at Broughton. He expired on January 3, 1641, when in the 23rd"
1828,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,year of his age.
1829,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1830,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"His death was a great grief to Crabtree, who, in one of his letters,"
1831,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,describes it as 'an irreparable loss:' and it is believed that he only
1832,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"survived him a few years.[5] Of the papers left by Horrox, only a few"
1833,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"have been preserved, and these were discovered in Crabtree's house after"
1834,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"his death. Among them was his treatise on the transit of Venus which,"
1835,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"with other papers, was purchased by Dr. Worthington, Fellow of Emmanuel"
1836,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"College, Cambridge, a man of learning, who was capable of appreciating"
1837,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"their value. Ultimately, the treatise fell into the possession of"
1838,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Hevelius, a celebrated German astronomer, who published it along with a"
1839,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"dissertation of his own, describing a transit of Mercury."
1840,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1841,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Horrox did not live to see any of his writings published, nor was any"
1842,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,monument erected to his memory until nearly two hundred years after his
1843,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"death. But his name, though long forgotten except by astronomers, is now"
1844,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"engraved on marble in Westminster Abbey. Had his life been spared, it"
1845,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,would have been difficult to foretell to what eminence and fame he might
1846,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"have risen, or what further discoveries his genius might have enabled"
1847,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,him to make. Few among English astronomers will hesitate to rank him
1848,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"next with the illustrious Newton, and all will agree with Herschel, who"
1849,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,called him 'the pride and the boast of British Astronomy.'
1850,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1851,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"WILLIAM GASCOIGNE was born in 1612, in the parish of Rothwell, in the"
1852,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"county of York, and afterwards resided at Middleton, near Leeds."
1853,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1854,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"He was a man of an inventive turn of mind, and possessed good abilities,"
1855,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,which he devoted to improving the methods of telescopic observation.
1856,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1857,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"At an early age he was occupied in observing celestial objects, making"
1858,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"researches in optics, and acquiring a proficient knowledge of astronomy."
1859,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1860,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Among his acquaintances were Crabtree and Horrox, with whom he carried"
1861,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,on a correspondence on matters appertaining to their favourite study.
1862,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1863,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,The measurement of small angles was found at all times to be one of the
1864,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,greatest difficulties which astronomers had to contend with. Tycho Brahé
1865,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,was so misled by his measurements of the apparent diameters of the Sun
1866,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"and Moon, that he concluded a total eclipse of the Sun was impossible."
1867,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1868,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Gascoigne overcame this difficulty by his invention of the micrometer.
1869,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"This instrument, when applied to a telescope, was found to be of great"
1870,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"service in the correct measurement of minute angles and distances, and"
1871,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,was the means of greatly advancing the progress of practical astronomy
1872,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"in the seventeenth century. A micrometer consists of a short tube,"
1873,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,across the opening of which are stretched two parallel wires; these
1874,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,being intersected at right angles by a third. The wires are moved to or
1875,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"from each other by delicately constructed screws, to which they are"
1876,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"attached. Each revolution, or part of a revolution, of a screw indicates"
1877,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,the distance by which the wires are moved.
1878,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1879,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"This apparatus, when placed in the focus of a lens, gives very accurate"
1880,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,measurements of the diameters of celestial objects. It was successfully
1881,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"used by Gascoigne in determining the apparent diameters of the Sun,"
1882,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Moon, and several of the planets, and the mutual distances of the stars"
1883,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,which form the Pleiades.
1884,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1885,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Crabtree, after having paid Gascoigne a visit in 1639, describes in a"
1886,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,letter to Horrox the impression created on his mind by the micrometer.
1887,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,He writes: 'The first thing Mr. Gascoigne showed me was a large
1888,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"telescope, amplified and adorned with new inventions of his own, whereby"
1889,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"he can take the diameters of the Sun or Moon, or any small angle in the"
1890,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"heavens or upon the earth, most exactly through the glass to a second.'"
1891,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1892,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,The micrometer is now regarded as an indispensable appliance in the
1893,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,observatory; the use of a spider web reticule instead of wire having
1894,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,improved its efficiency. Gascoigne was one of the earliest astronomers
1895,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,who recognised the value of the Keplerian telescope for observational
1896,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"purposes, and Sherburn affirms that he was the first to construct an"
1897,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,instrument of this description having two convex lenses. Whether this be
1898,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"true or not, it is certain that he applied the micrometer to the"
1899,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"telescope, and was the first to use telescopic sights, by means of which"
1900,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"he was able to fix the optical axis of his telescope, and ascertain by"
1901,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,observation the apparent positions of the heavenly bodies.
1902,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1903,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Crabtree, in a letter to Gascoigne, says: 'Could I purchase it with"
1904,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"travel, or procure it with gold, I would not be without a telescope for"
1905,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,observing small angles in the heavens; or want the use of your device of
1906,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"a glass in a cane upon the movable ruler of your sextant, as I remember"
1907,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,for helping to the exact point of the Sun's rays.'
1908,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1909,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,It was not known until the beginning of the eighteenth century that
1910,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Gascoigne had invented and used telescopic sights for the purpose of
1911,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,making accurate astronomical observations. The accidental discovery of
1912,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,some documents which contained a description of his appliances was the
1913,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,means by which this became known.
1914,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1915,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Townley states that Gascoigne had completed a treatise on optics, which"
1916,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"was ready for publication, but that no trace of the manuscript could be"
1917,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"discovered after his death. Having embraced the Royalist cause, William"
1918,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Gascoigne joined the forces of Charles I., and fell in the battle of"
1919,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Marston Moor on July 2, 1644."

1931,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"means of doubling the life of an astronomer, besides enabling him to"
1932,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,avoid errors and the tediousness associated with long and abstruse

1944,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Hooke, and the patient researches of Flamsteed--the first Astronomer"
1945,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Royal--were of much value in perfecting many details associated with the
1946,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,study of astronomy.
1947,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1948,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,The Royal Observatory at Greenwich was founded in 1675. The building was
1949,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,erected under a warrant from Charles II. It announces the desire of the
1950,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Sovereign to build a small observatory in the park at Greenwich, 'in"
1951,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,order to the finding out of the longitude for perfecting the art of
1952,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,navigation and astronomy.' This action on the part of the King may be
1953,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,regarded as the first public acknowledgment of the usefulness of
1954,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,astronomy for national purposes.
1955,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1956,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Since its erection, the observatory has been presided over by a"
1957,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"succession of talented men, who have raised it to a position of eminence"
1958,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,and usefulness unsurpassed by any similar institution in this or any
1959,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"other country. The well-known names of Flamsteed, Halley, Bradley, and"
1960,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Airy, testify to the valuable services rendered by those past directors"
1961,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,of the Greenwich Observatory in the cause of astronomical science.
1962,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1963,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,If we take a general survey of the science of astronomy as it existed
1964,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,from 1608 to 1674--a period that embraced the time in which Milton
1965,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"lived--we shall find that it was still compassed by ignorance,"
1966,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"superstition, and mystery. Astrology was zealously cultivated; most"
1967,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"persons of rank and position had their nativity or horoscope cast, and"
1968,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"the belief in the ruling of the planets, and their influence on human"
1969,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"and terrestrial affairs, was through long usage firmly established in"
1970,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"the public mind. Indeed, at this time, astronomy was regarded as a"
1971,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"handmaid to astrology; for, with the aid of astronomical calculation,"
1972,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,the professors of this occult science were enabled to predict the
1973,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"positions of the planets, and by this means practised their art with an"
1974,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,apparent degree of truthfulness.
1975,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1976,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Although over one hundred years had elapsed since the death of
1977,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Copernicus, his theory of the solar system did not find many supporters,"
1978,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,and the old forms of astronomical belief still retained their hold on
1979,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,the minds of the majority of philosophic thinkers. This can be partly
1980,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"accounted for, as many of the Ptolemaic doctrines were at first"
1981,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"associated with the Copernican theory, nor was it until a later period"
1982,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,that they were eliminated from the system.
1983,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1984,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,Though Copernicus deserved the credit of having transferred the centre
1985,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"of our system from the Earth to the Sun, yet his theory was imperfect in"
1986,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"its details, and contained many inaccuracies. He believed that the"
1987,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"planets could only move round the Sun in circular paths, nor was he"
1988,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,capable of conceiving of any other form of orbit in which they could
1989,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,perform their revolutions. He was therefore compelled to retain the use
1990,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"of cycles and epicycles, in order to account for irregularities in the"
1991,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,uniformly circular motions of those bodies.
1992,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
1993,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,We are indebted to the genius of Kepler for having placed the Copernican
1994,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"system upon a sure and irremovable basis, and for having raised"
1995,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,astronomy to the position of a true physical science. By his discovery
1996,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"that the planets travel round the Sun in elliptical orbits, he was"
1997,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"enabled to abolish cycles and epicycles, which created such confusion"
1998,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"and entanglement in the system, and to explain many apparent"
1999,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,irregularities of motion by ascribing to the Sun his true position with
2000,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,regard to the motions of the planets.
2001,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
2002,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"After the death of Kepler, which occurred in 1630, the most eminent"
2003,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"supporter of the Copernican theory was the illustrious Galileo, whose"
2004,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,belief in its accuracy and truthfulness was confirmed by his own
2005,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,discoveries.
2006,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
2007,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Five of the planets were known at this time--viz. Mercury, Venus, Mars,"
2008,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Jupiter, and Saturn; the latter, which revolves in its orbit at a"
2009,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"profound distance from the Sun, formed what at that time was believed to"
2010,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,be the boundary of the planetary system. The distance of the Earth from
2011,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"the Sun was approximately known, and the orb was observed to rotate on"
2012,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,his axis.
2013,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
2014,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"It was also ascertained that the Moon shone by reflected light, and that"
2015,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,her surface was varied by inequalities resembling those of our Earth.
2016,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"The elliptical form of her orbit had been discovered by Horrox, and her"
2017,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,elements were computed with a certain degree of accuracy.
2018,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
2019,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,The cloudy luminosity of the Milky Way had been resolved into a
2020,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"multitude of separate stars, disclosing the immensity of the stellar"
2021,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,universe.
2022,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
2023,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"The crescent form of the planet Venus, the satellites of Jupiter and of"
2024,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Saturn, and the progressive motion and measurement of light, had also"
2025,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,been discovered. Observations were made of transits of Mercury and
2026,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Venus, and refracting and reflecting telescopes were invented."

2030,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"unerring regularity their oval paths round the Sun, was not known at"
2031,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"this time. Though Newton was born in 1642, he did not disclose the"
2032,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,results of his philosophic investigations until 1687--thirteen years
2033,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"after the death of Milton--when, in the 'Principia,' he announced his"
2034,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,discovery of the great law of universal gravitation.
2035,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
2036,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Kepler, though he discovered the laws of planetary motion, was unable to"
2037,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,determine the motive force which guided and retained those bodies in
2038,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,their orbits. It was reserved for the genius of Newton to solve this
2039,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,wonderful problem. This great philosopher was able to prove 'that every
2040,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a
2041,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"force proportioned to the mass of the attracting body, and inversely as"
2042,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,the square of the distance between them.' Newton was capable of
2043,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,demonstrating that the force which guides and retains the Earth and
2044,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"planets in their orbits resides in the Sun, and by the application of"
2045,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,this law of gravitation he was able to explain the motions of all
2046,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,celestial bodies entering into the structure of the solar system.
2047,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
2048,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,This discovery may be regarded as the crowning point of the science of
2049,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"astronomy, for, upon the unfailing energy of this mysterious power"
2050,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"depend the order and stability of the universe, extending as it does to"
2051,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"all material bodies existing in space, guiding, controlling, and"
2052,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"retaining them in their several paths and orbits, whether it be a tiny"
2053,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"meteor, a circling planet, or a mighty sun."
2054,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
2055,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,The nature of cometary bodies and the laws which govern their motions
2056,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"were at this time still enshrouded in mystery, and when one of those"
2057,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,erratic wanderers made its appearance in the sky it was beheld by the
2058,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"majority of mankind with feelings of awe and superstitious dread, and"
2059,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"regarded as a harbinger of evil and disaster, the precursor of war, of"
2060,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"famine, or the overthrow of an empire."
2061,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
2062,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Newton, however, was able to divest those bodies of the mystery with"
2063,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,which they were surrounded by proving that any conic section may be
2064,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"described about the Sun, consistent with the law of gravitation, and"
2065,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"that comets, notwithstanding the eccentricity of their orbits, obey the"
2066,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,laws of planetary motion.
2067,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
2068,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Beyond the confines of our solar system, little was known of the"
2069,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,magnitude and extent of the sidereal universe which occupies the
2070,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,infinitude of space by which we are surrounded. The stars were
2071,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"recognised as self-luminous bodies, inconceivably remote, and although"
2072,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"they excited the curiosity of observers, and conjectures were made as to"
2073,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"their origin, yet no conclusive opinions were arrived at with regard to"
2074,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"their nature and constitution, and except that they were regarded as"
2075,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"glittering points of light which illumine the firmament, all else"
2076,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,appertaining to them remained an unravelled mystery. Even Copernicus had
2077,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,no notion of a universe of stars.
2078,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,
2079,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"Galileo, by his discovery that the galaxy consists of a multitude of"
2080,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"separate stars too remote to be defined by ordinary vision, demonstrated"
2081,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"how vast are the dimensions of the starry heavens, and on what a"
2082,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,stupendous scale the universe is constructed. But at this time it had
2083,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"not occurred to astronomers, nor was it known until many years after,"
2084,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,that the stars are suns which shine with a splendour resembling that of
2085,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"our Sun, and in many instances surpassing it. It was not until this"
2086,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,truth became known that the glories of the sidereal heavens were fully
2087,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"comprehended, and their magnificence revealed. It was then ascertained"
2088,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,that the minute points of light which crowd the fields of our largest
2089,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"telescopes, in their aggregations forming systems, clusters, galaxies,"
2090,ASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY,"and universes of stars, are shining orbs of light, among the countless"

2100,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2101,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,It would be reasonable to imagine that Milton's knowledge of astronomy
2102,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"was comprehensive and accurate, and superior to that possessed by most"
2103,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"scientific men of his age. His scholarly attainments, his familiarity"
2104,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"with ancient history and philosophy, his profound learning, and the"
2105,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"universality of his general knowledge, would lead one to conclude that"
2106,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"the science which treats of the mechanism of the heavens, and especially"
2107,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,the observational part of it--which at all times has been a source of
2108,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,inspiration to poets of every degree of excellence--was to him a study
2109,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"of absorbing interest, and one calculated to make a deep impression upon"
2110,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"his devoutly poetical mind. The serious character of Milton's verse, and"
2111,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,the reverent manner in which celestial incidents and objects are
2112,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"described in it, impress one with the belief that his contemplation of"
2113,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"the heavens, and of the orbs that roll and shine in the firmament"
2114,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"overhead, afforded him much enjoyment and meditative delight. For no"
2115,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"poet, in ancient or in modern times, has introduced into his writings"
2116,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"with such frequency, or with such pleasing effect, so many passages"
2117,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"descriptive of the beauty and grandeur of the heavens. No other poet,"
2118,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"by the creative effort of his imagination, has soared to such a height;"
2119,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"nor has he ever been excelled in his descriptions of the celestial orbs,"
2120,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,and of the beautiful phenomena associated with their different motions.
2121,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2122,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"In his minor poems, which were composed during his residence at Horton,"
2123,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"a charming rural retreat in Buckinghamshire, where the freshness and"
2124,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,varied beauty of the landscape and the attractive aspects of the
2125,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"midnight sky were ever before him, we find enchanting descriptions of"
2126,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"celestial objects, and especially of those orbs which, by their"
2127,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"brilliancy and lustre, have always commanded the admiration of mankind."
2128,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2129,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"For example, in 'L'Allegro' there are the following lines:--"
2130,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2131,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Right against the eastern gate
2132,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Where the great Sun begins his state,"
2133,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Robed in flames and amber light,"
2134,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,The clouds in thousand liveries dight;
2135,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2136,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,and in 'Il Penseroso'--
2137,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2138,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"To behold the wandering Moon,"
2139,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Riding near her highest noon,"
2140,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Like one that had been led astray
2141,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Through the heaven's wide pathless way,"
2142,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"And oft as if her head she bowed,"
2143,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Stooping through a fleecy cloud.
2144,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2145,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"In the happy choice of his theme, and by the comprehensive manner in"
2146,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"which he has treated it, Milton has been enabled by his poetic genius to"
2147,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"give to the world in his 'Paradise Lost' a poem which, for sublimity of"
2148,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"thought, loftiness of imagination, and beauty of expression in metrical"
2149,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"verse, is unsurpassed in any language."
2150,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2151,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"It is, however, our intention to deal only with those passages in the"
2152,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"poem in which allusion is made to the heavenly bodies, and to incidents"
2153,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,and occurrences associated with astronomical phenomena. In the
2154,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,exposition and illustration of these it has been considered desirable to
2155,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,adopt the following general classification:--
2156,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2157,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,1. To ascertain the extent of Milton's astronomical knowledge.
2158,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2159,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,2. To describe the starry heavens and the celestial objects mentioned in
2160,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,'Paradise Lost.'
2161,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2162,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,3. To exemplify the use which Milton has made of astronomy in the
2163,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,exercise of his imaginative and descriptive powers.
2164,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2165,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,In the earlier half of the seventeenth century the Ptolemaic theory--by
2166,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,which it was believed that the Earth was the immovable centre of the
2167,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"universe, and that round it all the heavenly bodies completed a diurnal"
2168,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,revolution--still retained its ascendency over the minds of men of
2169,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"learning and science, and all the doctrines associated with this ancient"
2170,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,astronomical creed were still religiously upheld by the educated classes
2171,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,among the peoples inhabiting the different civilised regions of the
2172,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,globe. The Copernican theory--by which the Sun is assigned the central
2173,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"position in our system, with the Earth and planets revolving in orbits"
2174,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,round him--obtained the support of a few persons of advanced views and
2175,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"high scientific attainments, but its doctrines had not yet seriously"
2176,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,threatened the supremacy of the older system. Though upwards of one
2177,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"hundred years had elapsed since the death of Copernicus, yet the"
2178,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,doctrines associated with the system of which he was the founder were
2179,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,but very tardily adopted up to this time. There were several reasons
2180,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,which accounted for this. The Copernican system was at first imperfect
2181,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"in its details, and included several of the Ptolemaic, doctrines which"
2182,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"rendered it less intelligible, and retarded its acceptance by persons"
2183,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,who would otherwise have been inclined to adopt it. Copernicus believed
2184,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,that the planets travelled round the Sun in circular paths. This
2185,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"necessitated the retention of cycles and epicycles, which gave rise to"
2186,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,much confusion; nor was it until Kepler made his great discovery of the
2187,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,ellipticity of the planetary orbits that they were eliminated from the
2188,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,system.
2189,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2190,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,As the Ptolemaic system of the universe held complete sway over the
2191,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"minds of men for upwards of twenty centuries, it was difficult to"
2192,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,persuade many persons to renounce the astronomical beliefs to which they
2193,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"were so firmly attached, in favour of those of any other system; so that"
2194,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,the overthrow of this venerable theory required a lengthened period of
2195,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,time for its accomplishment.
2196,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2197,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"It was thus in his earlier years, when Milton devoted his time to the"
2198,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"study of literature and philosophy, which he read extensively when"
2199,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"pursuing his academic career at Christ's College, Cambridge, and"
2200,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"afterwards at Horton, where he spent several years in acquiring a more"
2201,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"proficient knowledge of the literary, scientific, and philosophical"
2202,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"writings of the age, that he found the beliefs associated with the"
2203,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Ptolemaic theory adopted without doubt or hesitation by the numerous
2204,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,authors whose works he perused. His knowledge of Italian enabled him to
2205,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"become familiar with Dante--one of his favourite authors, whose poetical"
2206,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"writings were deeply read by him, and who, in the elaboration of his"
2207,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"poem, the 'Divina Commedia,' included the entire Ptolemaic cosmology."
2208,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2209,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"In England the Copernican theory had few supporters, and the majority of"
2210,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,those who represented the intellect and learning of the country still
2211,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,retained their adherence to the old form of astronomical belief. We
2212,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,therefore find that Milton followed the traditional way of thinking by
2213,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,adopting the views associated with the Ptolemaic theory.
2214,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2215,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"According to the Ptolemaic system, the Earth was regarded as the"
2216,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"immovable centre of the universe, and surrounding it were ten"
2217,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"crystalline spheres, or heavens, arranged in concentric circles, the"
2218,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,larger spheres enclosing the smaller ones; and within those was situated
2219,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"the cosmos, or mundane universe, usually described as 'the Heavens and"
2220,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,the Earth.' To each of the first seven spheres there was attached a

2230,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,4th sphere: that of the Sun; regarded as a planet.

2241,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2242,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"The eighth sphere included all the fixed stars, and was called the"
2243,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"firmament, because it was believed to impart steadiness to the inner"
2244,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"spheres, and, by its diurnal revolution, to carry them round the Earth,"
2245,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,causing the change of day and night.
2246,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2247,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"The separate motions of the spheres, revolving with different"
2248,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"velocities, and at different angles to each other, accounted for the"
2249,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,astronomical phenomena associated with the orbs attached to each.
2250,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"According to Ptolemy's scheme, the eighth sphere formed the outermost"
2251,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,boundary of the universe; but later astronomers added to this system two
2252,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"other spheres--a _ninth_, called the _Crystalline_, which caused"
2253,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Precession of the Equinoxes; and a _tenth_, called the _Primum Mobile_,"
2254,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"or First Moved, which brought about the alternation of day and night, by"
2255,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,carrying all the other spheres round the Earth once in every twenty-four
2256,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"hours. The Primum Mobile enclosed, as if in a shell, all the other"
2257,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"spheres, in which was included the created universe, and, although of"
2258,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"vast dimensions, its conception did not overwhelm the mind in the same"
2259,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,manner that the effort to comprehend infinitude does.
2260,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2261,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Beyond this last sphere there was believed to exist a boundless,"
2262,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"uncircumscribed region, of immeasurable extent, called the Empyrean, or"
2263,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Heaven of Heavens, the incorruptible abode of the Deity, the place of"
2264,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"eternal mysteries, which the comprehension of man was unable to fathom,"
2265,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,and of which it was impossible for his mind to form any conception. Such
2266,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,were the imaginative beliefs upon which this ancient astronomical theory
2267,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"was founded, that for a period of upwards of two thousand years held"
2268,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"undisputed sway over the minds of men, and exercised during that time a"
2269,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"predominating influence upon the imagination, thoughts, and conceptions"
2270,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"of all those who devoted themselves to literature, science, and art. Of"
2271,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,the truthfulness of this assertion there is ample evidence in the
2272,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"poetical, philosophical, and historical writings of ancient authors,"
2273,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,whose ideas and conceptions regarding the created universe were limited
2274,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,and circumscribed by this form of astronomical belief. In the works of
2275,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,more recent writers we find that it continued to assert its influence;
2276,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"and among our English poets, from Chaucer down to Shakespeare, there are"
2277,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,numerous references to the natural phenomena associated with this
2278,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"system, and most frequently expressed by poetical allusions to 'the"
2279,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,music of the spheres.'
2280,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2281,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,The ideas associated with the Ptolemaic theory were gratifying to the
2282,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"pride and vanity of man, who could regard with complacency the paramount"
2283,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"importance of the globe which he inhabited, and of which he was the"
2284,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"absolute ruler, fixed in the centre of the universe, and surrounded by"
2285,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"ten revolving spheres, that carried along with them in their circuit all"
2286,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"other celestial bodies--Sun, Moon, and stars, which would appear to have"
2287,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"been created for his delectation, and for the purpose of ministering to"
2288,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,his requirements. But when the Copernican theory became better
2289,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"understood, and especially after the discovery of the law of universal"
2290,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"gravitation, this venerable system of the universe, based upon a pile of"
2291,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"unreasonable and false hypotheses, after an existence of over twenty"
2292,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"centuries, sank into oblivion, and was no more heard of."
2293,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2294,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Milton's Ptolemaism is apparent in some of his shorter pieces, and also"
2295,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"in his minor poems, 'Arcades' and 'Comus.' His 'Ode on the Nativity' is"
2296,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"written in conformity with this belief, and the expression,"
2297,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2298,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Ring out ye crystal spheres,"
2299,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2300,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,indicates a poetical allusion to this theory. But as Milton grew older
2301,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"his Ptolemaism became greatly modified, and there are good reasons for"
2302,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,believing that in his latter years he renounced it entirely in favour of
2303,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Copernicanism. When on his continental tour in 1638, he made the"
2304,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,acquaintance of eminent men who held views different from those with
2305,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"which he was familiar; and in his interview with Galileo at Arcetri, the"
2306,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,aged astronomer may have impressed upon his mind the superiority of the
2307,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Copernican theory, in accounting for the occurrence of celestial"
2308,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"phenomena, as compared with the Ptolemaic."
2309,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2310,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"On his return to England from the Continent, Milton took up his"
2311,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"residence in London, and lived in apartments in a house in St. Bride's"
2312,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Churchyard. Having no regular vocation, and not wishing to be dependent"
2313,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"upon his father, he undertook the education of his two nephews, John and"
2314,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Edward Phillips, aged nine and ten years respectively. From St. Bride's"
2315,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Churchyard he removed to a larger house in Aldersgate, where he received"
2316,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,as pupils the sons of some of his most intimate acquaintances. In the
2317,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,list of subjects which Milton selected for the purpose of imparting
2318,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"instruction to those youths he included astronomy and mathematics,"
2319,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,which formed part of the curriculum of this educational establishment.
2320,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,The text-book from which he taught his nephews and other pupils
2321,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"astronomy was called 'De Sphæra Mundi,' a work written by Joannes"
2322,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Sacrobasco (John Holywood) in the thirteenth century. This book was an
2323,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"epitome of Ptolemy's 'Almagest,' and therefore entirely Ptolemaic in its"
2324,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"teaching. It enjoyed great popularity during the Middle Ages, and is"
2325,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,reported to have gone through as many as forty editions.
2326,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2327,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,The selection of astronomy as one of the subjects in which Milton
2328,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,instructed his pupils affords us evidence that he must have devoted
2329,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,considerable time and attention to acquiring a knowledge of the facts
2330,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,and details associated with the study of the science. In the attainment
2331,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,of this he had to depend upon his own exertions and the assistance
2332,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,derived from astronomical books; for at this time astronomy received no
2333,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,recognition as a branch of study at any of the universities; and in
2334,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Britain the science attracted less attention than on the Continent,"
2335,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,where the genius of Kepler and Galileo elevated it to a position of
2336,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,national importance.
2337,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2338,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,We shall find as we proceed that Milton's knowledge of astronomy was
2339,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,comprehensive and accurate; that he was familiar with the astronomical
2340,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,reasons by which many natural phenomena which occur around us can be
2341,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,explained; and that he understood many of the details of the science
2342,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,which are unknown to ordinary observers of the heavens.
2343,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2344,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,It is remarkable how largely astronomy enters into the composition of
2345,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"'Paradise Lost,' and we doubt if any author could have written such a"
2346,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,poem without possessing a knowledge of the heavens and of the celestial
2347,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,orbs such as can only be attained by a proficient and intimate
2348,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,acquaintance with this science.
2349,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2350,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,The arguments in favour of or against the Ptolemaic and Copernican
2351,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"theories were well known to Milton, even as regards their minute"
2352,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,details; and in Book viii. he introduces a scientific discussion based
2353,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,upon the respective merits of those theories. The configuration of the
2354,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"celestial and terrestrial spheres, and the great circles by which they"
2355,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"are circumscribed, he also knew. The causes which bring about the change"
2356,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,of the seasons; the obliquity of the ecliptic; the zodiacal
2357,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"constellations through which the Sun travels, and the periods of the"
2358,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"year in which he occupies them, are embraced in Milton's knowledge of"
2359,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"the science of astronomy. The motions of the Earth, including the"
2360,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Precession of the Equinoxes; the number and distinctive appearances of
2361,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"the planets, their direct and retrograde courses, and their satellites,"
2362,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"are also described by him. The constellations, and their relative"
2363,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"positions on the celestial sphere; the principal stars, star-groups, and"
2364,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"clusters, and the Galaxy, testify to Milton's knowledge of astronomy,"
2365,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,and to the use which he has made of the science in the elaboration of
2366,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,his poem.
2367,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2368,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,The names of fourteen of the constellations are mentioned in 'Paradise
2369,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Lost.' These, when arranged alphabetically, read as follows:--"
2370,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2371,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Andromeda, Aries, Astrea, Centaurus, Cancer, Capricornus, Gemini, Leo,"
2372,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Libra, Ophiuchus, Orion, Scorpio, Taurus, and Virgo. Milton's allusions"
2373,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,to the zodiacal constellations are chiefly associated with his
2374,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,description of the Sun's path in the heavens; but with the celestial
2375,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,sign Libra (the _Scales_) he has introduced a lofty and poetical
2376,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,conception of the means by which the Creator made known His will when
2377,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,there arose a contention between Gabriel and Satan on his discovery in
2378,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Paradise.
2379,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2380,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"The Eternal, to prevent such horrid fray,"
2381,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Hung forth in Heaven his golden scales, yet seen"
2382,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Betwixt Astrea[6] and the Scorpion sign,"
2383,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Wherein all things created first he weighed,"
2384,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,The pendulous round Earth with balanced air
2385,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"In counterpoise, now ponders all events,"
2386,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Battles and realms. In these he put two weights,"
2387,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,The sequel each of parting and of fight:
2388,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"The latter quick up flew, and kicked the beam.--iv. 996-1004."
2389,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2390,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Orion, the finest constellation in the heavens, did not escape Milton's"
2391,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"observation, and there is one allusion to it in his poem. It arrives on"
2392,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"the meridian in winter, where it is conspicuous as a brilliant"
2393,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"assemblage of stars, and represents an armed giant, or hunter, holding a"
2394,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"massive club in his right hand, and having a shield of lion's hide on"
2395,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"his left arm. A triple-gemmed belt encircles his waist, from which is"
2396,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"suspended a glittering sword, tipped with a bright star. The two"
2397,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"brilliants Betelgeux and Bellatrix form the giant's shoulders, and the"
2398,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,bright star Rigel marks the position of his advanced foot. The rising of
2399,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Orion was believed to be accompanied by stormy and tempestuous weather.
2400,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Milton alludes to this in the following lines:--
2401,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2402,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,When with fierce winds Orion armed
2403,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Hath vexed the Red Sea coast, whose waves o'erthrew"
2404,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Busiris and his Memphian chivalry.--i. 305-7.
2405,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2406,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Andromeda is described as being borne by Aries, and in 'Ophiuchus huge'"
2407,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Milton locates a comet which extends the whole length of the
2408,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,constellation. It is evident that Milton possessed a precise knowledge
2409,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"of the configuration and size of the constellations, and of the"
2410,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,positions which they occupy relatively to each other on the celestial
2411,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,sphere.
2412,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2413,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Though Milton was conversant with the Copernican theory, and entertained"
2414,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"a conviction of its accuracy and truthfulness, and doubtless recognised"
2415,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"the superiority of this system, which, besides conveying to the mind a"
2416,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,nobler conception of the universe and of the solar system--though it
2417,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,diminished the importance of the Earth as a member of it--was capable of
2418,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,explaining the occurrence of celestial phenomena in a manner more
2419,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,satisfactory than could be arrived at by the Ptolemaic theory.
2420,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Notwithstanding this, he selected the Ptolemaic cosmology as the"
2421,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"scientific basis upon which he constructed his 'Paradise Lost,' and in"
2422,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,its elaboration adhered with marked fidelity to this system. There were
2423,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"many reasons why Milton, in the composition of an imaginative poem,"
2424,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,should have chosen the Ptolemaic system of the universe rather than the
2425,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Copernican. This form of astronomical belief was adopted by all the
2426,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"authors whose works he perused and studied in his younger days,"
2427,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"including his favourite poet, Dante; and his own poetic imaginings, as"
2428,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"indicated by his early poems, were in harmony with the doctrines of this"
2429,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"astronomical creed, a long acquaintance with which had, without doubt,"
2430,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"influenced his mind in its favour. This system of revolving spheres,"
2431,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"with the steadfast Earth at its centre, and the whole enclosed by the"
2432,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Primum Mobile, constituted a more attractive and picturesque object for"
2433,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,poetic description than the simple and uncircumscribed arrangement of
2434,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,the universe expressed by the Copernican theory. It also afforded him an
2435,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,opportunity of localising those regions of space in which the chief
2436,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"incidents in his poem are described--viz. HEAVEN, or THE EMPYREAN,"
2437,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"CHAOS, HELL, and the MUNDANE UNIVERSE. Milton's Ptolemaism, with its"
2438,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"adjuncts, may be understood by the following:"
2439,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2440,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"All that portion of space above the newly created universe, and beyond"
2441,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"the Primum Mobile, was known as HEAVEN, or THE EMPYREAN--a region of"
2442,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"light, of glory, and of happiness; the dwelling-place of the Deity, Who,"
2443,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"though omnipresent, here visibly revealed Himself to all the multitude"
2444,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"of angels whom He created, and who surrounded his throne in adoration"
2445,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,and worship.
2446,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2447,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Underneath the universe there existed a vast region of similar
2448,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"dimensions to the Empyrean, called CHAOS, which was occupied by the"
2449,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"embryo elements of matter, that with incessant turmoil and confusion"
2450,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,warred with each other for supremacy--a wild abyss--
2451,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2452,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,The womb of Nature and perhaps her grave.--ii. 911.
2453,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2454,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"The lower portion of this region was divided off from the remainder, and"
2455,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"embraced the locality known as HELL--the place of torment, where the"
2456,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,rebellious angels were driven and shut in after their expulsion from
2457,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Heaven.
2458,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2459,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,As far removed from God and light of Heaven
2460,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,As from the centre thrice to the utmost pole.--i. 73-74.
2461,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2462,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"The NEW UNIVERSE, which included the Earth and all the orbs of the"
2463,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"firmament known as the Starry Heavens, was created out of Chaos, and"
2464,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"hung, as if suspended by a golden chain, from the Empyrean above; and"
2465,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"although its magnitude and dimensions were inconceivable, yet, according"
2466,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"to the Ptolemaic theory, it was enclosed by the tenth sphere or Primum"
2467,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Mobile.
2468,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2469,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,By this partitioning of space Milton was able to contrive a system which
2470,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,fulfilled the requirements of his great poem.
2471,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2472,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,The annexed diagram explains the relative positions of the different
2473,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,regions into which space was divided.
2474,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2475,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Though there are traces of Copernicanism found in 'Paradise Lost,' yet"
2476,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Milton has very faithfully adhered to the Ptolemaic mechanism and
2477,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,nomenclature throughout his poem.
2478,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2479,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"In his description of the Creation, the Earth is formed first, then the"
2480,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Sun, followed by the Moon, and afterwards the stars, all of which are"
2481,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,described as being in motion round the Earth. Allusion is also made to
2482,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"this ancient system in several prominent passages, and in the following"
2483,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,lines there is a distinct reference to the various revolving spheres.
2484,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2485,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,[Illustration: FIG. 2]
2486,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2487,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"They pass the planets seven, and pass the fixed,"
2488,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,And that crystalline sphere whose balance weighs
2489,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"The trepidation talked, and that first moved.--iii. 481-83."
2490,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2491,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"The seven planetary spheres are first mentioned; then the eighth sphere,"
2492,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"or that of the fixed stars; then the ninth, or crystalline, which was"
2493,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"believed to cause a shaking, or trepidation, to account for certain"
2494,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"irregularities in the motions of the stars; and, lastly, the tenth"
2495,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"sphere, or Primum Mobile, called the 'first moved' because it set the"
2496,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,other spheres in motion.
2497,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2498,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"To an uninstructed observer, the apparent motion of the heavenly bodies"
2499,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"round the Earth would naturally lead him to conclude that, of the two"
2500,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"theories, the Ptolemaic was the correct one. We therefore find that"
2501,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Milton adopted the system most in accord with the knowledge and
2502,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,intelligence possessed by the persons portrayed by him in his poem; and
2503,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,in describing the natural phenomena witnessed in the heavens by our
2504,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"first parents, he adheres to the doctrines of the Ptolemaic system, as"
2505,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,being most in harmony with the simple and primitive conceptions of those
2506,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,created beings.
2507,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2508,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"To their upward gaze, the orbs of heaven appeared to be in ceaseless"
2509,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"motion; the solid Earth, upon which they stood, was alone immovable and"
2510,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,at rest. Day after day they observed the Sun pursue his steadfast course
2511,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"with unerring regularity: his rising in the east, accompanied by the"
2512,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"rosy hues of morn; his meridian splendour, and his sinking in the west,"

2514,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"floating in the azure sky, as he bids farewell for a time to scenes of"
2515,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"life and happiness, rejoicing in the light and warmth of his"
2516,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"all-cheering beams. With the advent of night they beheld the Moon, now"
2517,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"increasing, now waning, pursue her irregular path, also to disappear in"
2518,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"the west; whilst, like the bands of an army marshalled in loose array,"
2519,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"the constellations of glittering stars, with stately motion, traversed"
2520,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"their nocturnal arcs, circling the pole of the heavens."
2521,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2522,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"By referring to Book viii., 15-175, we find an account of an interesting"
2523,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"scientific discussion, or conversation, between Adam and Raphael"
2524,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"regarding the merits of the Ptolemaic and Copernican systems, and of the"
2525,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,relative importance and size of the heavenly bodies. By it we are
2526,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,afforded an opportunity of learning how accurate and precise a knowledge
2527,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Milton possessed of both theories, and in what clear and perspicuous"
2528,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,language he expresses his arguments in favour of or against the
2529,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,doctrines associated with each.
2530,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2531,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"We may, with good reason, regard the views expressed by Adam as"
2532,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"representing Milton's own opinions, which were in conformity with the"
2533,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Copernican theory; and in the Angel's reply, though of an undecided"
2534,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"character, we are able to perceive how aptly Milton describes the"
2535,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,erroneous conclusions upon which the Ptolemaic theory was based.
2536,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2537,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"In this scientific discussion, it would seem rather strange that Adam,"
2538,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"the first of men, should have been capable of such philosophic"
2539,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"reasoning, propounding, as if by intuition, a theory upon which was"
2540,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,founded a system that had not been discovered until many centuries after
2541,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,the time that astronomy became a science. By attributing to Adam such a
2542,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"degree of intelligence and wisdom, the poet has taken a liberty which"
2543,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,enabled him to carry on this discussion in a manner befitting the
2544,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,importance of the subject.
2545,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2546,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"In the following lines Adam expresses to his Angel-guest, in forcible"
2547,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"and convincing language, his reasons in support of the Copernican"
2548,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,theory:--
2549,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2550,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"When I behold this goodly frame, this World,"
2551,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Of Heaven and Earth consisting, and compute"
2552,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Their magnitudes--this Earth, a spot, a grain,"
2553,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"An atom, with the Firmament compared"
2554,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"And all her numbered stars, that seem to roll"
2555,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Spaces incomprehensible (for such
2556,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Their distance argues, and their swift return"
2557,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Diurnal) merely to officiate light
2558,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot,"
2559,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"One day and night, in all her vast survey"
2560,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Useless besides--reasoning, I oft admire,"
2561,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"How Nature, wise and frugal could commit"
2562,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Such disproportions, with superfluous hand"
2563,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"So many nobler bodies to create,"
2564,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Greater so manifold, to this one use,"
2565,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"For aught appears, and on their Orbs impose"
2566,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Such restless revolution day by day
2567,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Repeated, while the sedentary Earth,"
2568,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"That better might with far less compass move,"
2569,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Served by more noble than herself, attains"
2570,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Her end without least motion, and receives,"
2571,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"As tribute, such a sumless journey brought"
2572,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light;"
2573,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Speed, to describe whose swiftness number fails.--viii. 15-38."
2574,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2575,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,We are enabled to perceive that Milton had formed a correct conception
2576,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"of the magnitude and proportions of the universe, and also of the"
2577,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"relative size and importance of the Earth, which he describes as 'a"
2578,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"spot, a grain, an atom,' when compared with the surrounding heavens. He"
2579,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"expresses his surprise that all the stars of the firmament, whose"
2580,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"distances are so remote, and whose dimensions so greatly exceed those of"
2581,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"this globe, should in their diurnal revolution have 'such a sumless"
2582,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,journey of incorporeal speed imposed upon them' merely to officiate
2583,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"light to the Earth, 'this punctual spot;' and reasoning, wonders how"
2584,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Nature, wise and frugal in her ways, should commit such disproportions,"
2585,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"by adopting means so great to accomplish a result so small, when motion"
2586,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,imparted to the sedentary Earth would with greater ease produce the same
2587,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,effect.
2588,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2589,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,The inconceivable velocity with which it would be necessary for those
2590,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,orbs to travel in order to accomplish a daily revolution round the Earth
2591,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"might be described as almost spiritual, and beyond the power of"
2592,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,calculation by numbers.
2593,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2594,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"The Angel, after listening to Adam's argument, expresses approval of his"
2595,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"desire to obtain knowledge, but answers him dubiously, and at the same"
2596,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,time criticises in a severe and adverse manner the Ptolemaic theory.
2597,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2598,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,To ask or search I blame thee not; for Heaven
2599,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Is as the Book of God before thee set,"

2617,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2618,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"When, with the advancement of science, astronomical observations were"
2619,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"made with greater accuracy, it was discovered that uniformity of motion"
2620,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,was not always maintained by those bodies which were believed to move in
2621,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"circles round the Earth. It was observed that the Sun, when on one side"
2622,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"of his orbit, had an accelerated motion, as compared with the speed at"
2623,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"which he travelled when on the other side. The planets, also, appeared"
2624,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"to move with irregularity: sometimes a planet was observed to advance,"
2625,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"then become stationary, and afterwards affect a retrograde movement."
2626,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Those inequalities of motion could not be explained by means of the
2627,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"revolution of crystalline spheres alone, but were accounted for by"
2628,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"imagining the existence of a small circle, or epicycle, whose centre"
2629,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"corresponded with a fixed point in the larger circle, or eccentric, as"
2630,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,it was called. This small circle revolved on its axis when carried round
2631,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"with the larger one, and round it the planet also revolved, which when"
2632,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"situated in its outer portion would have a forward, and when in its"
2633,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"inner portion a retrograde, motion."
2634,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2635,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,The theory of eccentrics and epicycles was sufficient for a time to
2636,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"account for the inequalities of motion already described, and by this"
2637,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,means the Ptolemaic system was enabled to retain its ascendency for a
2638,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,longer period than it otherwise would have done. But more recent
2639,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,discoveries brought to light discrepancies and difficulties which were
2640,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,explained away by adding epicycle to epicycle. This created a most
2641,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"complicated entanglement, and hastened the downfall of a system which,"
2642,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"after an existence of many centuries, sank into oblivion, and is now"
2643,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,remembered as a belief of bygone ages.
2644,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2645,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"The devices which the upholders of this system were compelled to adopt,"
2646,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"in order 'to save appearances,' with 'centric and eccentric,' cycle and"
2647,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"epicycle, 'orb in orb,' are in this manner appropriately described by"
2648,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Milton, as indicating the confusion arising from a theory based upon"
2649,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,false hypotheses.
2650,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2651,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Continuing his reply, the Angel says:--"
2652,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2653,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Already by thy reasoning this I guess,"
2654,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Who art to lead thy offspring, and supposest"
2655,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,That bodies bright and greater should not serve
2656,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"The less not bright, nor Heaven such journies run,"
2657,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Earth sitting still, when she alone receives"
2658,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"The benefit. Consider, first, that great"
2659,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Or bright infers not excellence. The Earth,"
2660,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Though, in comparison of Heaven, so small,"
2661,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Nor glistering, may of solid good contain"
2662,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"More plenty than the Sun that barren shines,"
2663,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Whose virtue on itself works no effect,"
2664,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"But in the fruitful Earth; there first received,"
2665,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"His beams, inactive else, their vigour find,"
2666,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Yet not to Earth are those bright luminaries
2667,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Officious, but to thee, Earth's habitant."
2668,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"And, for the Heaven's wide circuit, let it speak"
2669,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"The Maker's high magnificence, who built"
2670,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"So spacious, and his line stretched out so far,"
2671,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,That Man may know he dwells not in his own--
2672,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"An edifice too large for him to fill,"
2673,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Lodged in a small partition; and the rest
2674,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Ordained for uses to his Lord best known,"
2675,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"The swiftness of those Circles attribute,"
2676,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Though numberless, to his Omnipotence,"
2677,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,That to corporeal substances could add
2678,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Speed almost spiritual. Me thou think'st not slow,"
2679,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Who since the morning-hour set out from Heaven
2680,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Where God resides, and ere midday arrived"
2681,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,In Eden--distance inexpressible
2682,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"By numbers that have name. But this I urge,"
2683,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Admitting motion in the Heavens, to show"
2684,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Invalid that which thee to doubt it moved;
2685,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Not that I so affirm, though so it seem"
2686,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth.
2687,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"God, to remove his ways from human sense,"
2688,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Placed Heaven from Earth so far, that earthly sight,"
2689,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"If it presume, might err in things too high,"
2690,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,And no advantage gain.--viii. 85-122.
2691,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2692,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Notwithstanding the Angel's severe criticism of the Ptolemaic system, he"
2693,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"does not unreservedly support the conclusions arrived at by Adam, but"
2694,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,endeavours to show that his reasoning may not be altogether correct. He
2695,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,questions the validity of his argument that bodies of greater size and
2696,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"brightness should not serve the smaller, though not bright, and that"
2697,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"heaven should move, while the Earth remained at rest. He argues that"
2698,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"great or bright infers not excellence, and that the Earth, though small,"
2699,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"may contain more virtue than the Sun, that 'barren shines,' whose beams"
2700,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"create no beneficial effect, except when directed on the fruitful"
2701,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Earth. He reminds Adam that those bright luminaries minister not to the
2702,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Earth, but to himself, 'Earth's habitant,' and directs his attention to"
2703,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"the magnificence and extent of the surrounding universe, of which he"
2704,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,occupies but a small portion. The diurnal swiftness of the orbs that
2705,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"move round the Earth he attributes to God's omnipotence, that to"
2706,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,material bodies 'could add speed almost spiritual.'
2707,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2708,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"The Angel, after alluding to his rapid flight through space, suggests"
2709,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,that God placed heaven so far from Earth that man might not presume to
2710,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,inquire into things which it would be of no advantage for him to know.
2711,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"He then suddenly changes to the Copernican system, which he lucidly"
2712,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,describes in the following lines:--
2713,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2714,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,What if the Sun
2715,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Be centre to the World, and other stars"
2716,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,By his attractive virtue and their own

2719,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Progressive, retrograde, or standing still,"
2720,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"In six thou seest; and what if, seventh to these"
2721,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"The planet Earth, so steadfast though she seem,"
2722,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Insensibly three different motions move?
2723,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Which else to several spheres thou must ascribe,"
2724,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Moved contrary with thwart obliquities,"
2725,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Or save the Sun his labour, and that swift"
2726,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed
2727,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Invisible else above all stars, the wheel"
2728,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Of day and night; which needs not thy belief,"
2729,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"If Earth, industrious of herself, fetch day"
2730,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Travelling east, and with her part averse"
2731,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"From the Sun's beam meet night, her other part"
2732,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Still luminous by his ray. What if that light,"
2733,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Sent from her through the wide transpicuous air,"
2734,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"To the terrestrial Moon be as a star,"
2735,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Enlightening her by day, as she by night"
2736,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"This Earth--reciprocal, if land be there,"
2737,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Fields and inhabitants? Her spots thou seest
2738,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"As clouds, and clouds may rain, and rain produce"
2739,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Fruits in her softened soil, for some to eat"

2741,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"With their attendant Moons, thou wilt descry,"
2742,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Communicating male and female light--
2743,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Which two great sexes animate the World,"
2744,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Stored in each orb perhaps with some that live.
2745,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,For such vast room in Nature unpossessed
2746,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"By living soul, desert and desolate,"
2747,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Only to shine, yet scarce to contribute"
2748,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Each orb a glimpse of light, conveyed so far"
2749,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Down to this habitable, which returns"
2750,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Light back to them, is obvious to dispute.--viii. 122-58."
2751,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2752,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"The Copernican theory, which is less complicated and more easily"
2753,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"understood than the Ptolemaic, is described by Milton with accuracy and"
2754,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,methodical skill.
2755,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2756,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,The Sun having been assigned that central position in the system which
2757,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"his magnitude and importance claim as his due, the planets circling in"
2758,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,orbits around him have their motions described in a manner indicative of
2759,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,the precise knowledge which Milton acquired of this theory. At this time
2760,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"the law of gravitation was unknown, and, although the ellipticity of the"
2761,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"orbits of the planets had been discovered by Kepler, the nature of the"
2762,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,motive force which guided and retained them in their paths still
2763,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,remained a mystery. It was believed that the planets were whirled round
2764,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"the Sun, as if by the action of magnetic fibres; a mutual attractive"
2765,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"influence having been supposed to exist between them and the orb,"
2766,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,similar to that of the opposite poles of magnets.
2767,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2768,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Milton alludes to this theory in the following lines:--
2769,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2770,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"They, as they move"
2771,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Their starry dance in numbers that compute
2772,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Days, months, and years, towards his all-cheering lamp"
2773,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Turn swift their various motions, or are turned"
2774,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,By his magnetic beam.--iii. 579-83.
2775,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2776,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"An important advance upon this theory was made by Horrox, who, in his"
2777,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"study of celestial dynamics, attributed the curvilineal motion of the"
2778,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"planets to the influence of two forces, one projective, the other"
2779,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,attractive. He illustrated this by observing the path described by a
2780,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,stone when thrown obliquely into the air. He perceived that its motion
2781,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"was governed by the impulse imparted to it by the hand, and also by the"
2782,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"attractive force of the Earth. Under these two influences, the stone"
2783,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"describes a graceful curve, and in its descent falls at the same angle"
2784,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,at which it rose. Hence arises the general law: 'When two spheres are
2785,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"mutually attracted, and if not prevented by foreign influences, their"
2786,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"straight paths are deflected into curves concave to each other, and"
2787,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"corresponding with one of the sections of a cone, according to the"
2788,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,velocity of the revolving body. If the velocity with which the revolving
2789,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,body is impelled be equal to what it would acquire by falling through
2790,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"half the radius of a circle described from the centre of deflection, its"
2791,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"orbit will be circular; but if it be less than that quantity, its path"
2792,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,becomes elliptical.'
2793,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2794,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Newton afterwards embraced this law in his great principle of
2795,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"gravitation, and demonstrated that the force which guides and retains"
2796,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,the Earth and planets in their orbits resides in the Sun. By the orb's
2797,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"attractive influence a planet, after having received its first impulse,"
2798,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"is deflected from its original straight path, and bent towards that"
2799,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"luminary, and by the combined action of the projective and attractive"
2800,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"forces is made to describe an orbit which, if elliptical, has one of its"
2801,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"foci occupied by the Sun. So evenly balanced are those two forces, that"
2802,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"one is unable to gain any permanent ascendency over the other, and"
2803,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"consequently the planet traverses its orbit with unerring regularity,"
2804,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"and, if undisturbed by external influences, will continue in its path"
2805,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,for all time.
2806,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2807,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Milton describes the position of the planets in the sky as--
2808,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2809,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Now high, now low, then hid;"
2810,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2811,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,and their motions--
2812,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2813,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Progressive, retrograde, or standing still."
2814,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2815,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,It is evident that Milton was familiar with the apparently irregular
2816,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,paths pursued by the planets when observed from the Earth. He knew of
2817,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"their stationary points, and also the backward loopings traced out by"
2818,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,them on the surface of the sphere.
2819,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2820,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"If observed from the Sun, all the planets would be seen to follow their"
2821,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,true paths round that body; their motion would invariably lie in the
2822,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"same direction, and any variation in their speed as they approached"
2823,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"perihelion or aphelion would be real. But the planets, when observed"
2824,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"from the Earth, which is itself in motion, appear to move irregularly."
2825,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Sometimes they remain stationary for a brief period, and, instead of"
2826,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"progressing onward, affect a retrograde movement. This irregularity of"
2827,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"motion is only apparent, and can be explained as a result of the"
2828,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"combined motions of the Earth and planets, which are travelling together"
2829,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"round the Sun with different velocities, and in orbits of unequal"
2830,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,magnitude.
2831,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2832,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,In his allusion to the Copernican system the 'planet' 'Earth' is
2833,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"described by Milton as seventh. This is not strictly accurate, as only"
2834,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"five planets were known--viz. Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn;"
2835,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"but to make up the number Milton has included the Moon, which may be"
2836,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,regarded as the Earth's planet.
2837,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2838,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,The three motions ascribed to the Earth are--(1) The diurnal rotation on
2839,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,her axis; (2) her annual revolution round the Sun; (3) Precession of the
2840,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Equinoxes.
2841,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2842,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,The rotation of the Earth on her axis may be likened to the spinning
2843,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"motion of a top, and is the cause of the alternation of day and night."
2844,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"This rotatory motion is sustained with such exact precision that, during"
2845,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"the past 2,000 years, it has been impossible to detect the minutest"
2846,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,difference in the time in which the Earth accomplishes a revolution on
2847,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"her axis, and therefore the length of the sidereal day, which is 3"
2848,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"minutes 56 seconds shorter than the mean solar day, is invariable. In"
2849,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,this motion of the Earth we have a time-measuring unit which may be
2850,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,regarded as absolutely correct.
2851,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2852,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,The Earth completes a revolution of her orbit in 365-1/4 days. In this
2853,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"period of time she accomplishes a journey of 580 millions of miles,"
2854,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"travelling at the average rate of 66,000 miles an hour. The change of"
2855,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"the seasons, and the lengthening and shortening of the day, are natural"
2856,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"phenomena, which occur as a consequence of the Earth's annual revolution"
2857,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,round the Sun. Precession is a retrograde or westerly motion of the
2858,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"equinoctial points, caused by the attraction of the Sun, Moon, and"
2859,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,planets on the spheroidal figure of the Earth. By this movement the
2860,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,poles of the Earth are made to describe a circular path in that part of
2861,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"the heavens to which they point; so that, after the lapse of many years,"
2862,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,the star which is known as the Pole Star will not occupy the position
2863,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"indicated by its name, but will be situated at a considerable distance"
2864,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"from the pole. These motions, Milton says, unless attributed to the"
2865,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Earth, must be ascribed to several spheres crossing and thwarting each"
2866,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"other obliquely; but the Earth, by rotating from west to east, will of"
2867,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"herself fetch day, her other half, averted from the Sun's rays, being"
2868,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"enveloped in night. Thus saving the Sun his labour, and the 'primum"
2869,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"mobile,' 'that swift nocturnal and diurnal rhomb,' which carried all the"
2870,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"lower spheres along with it, and brought about the change of day and"
2871,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,night.
2872,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2873,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Milton's allusion to the occurrence of natural phenomena in the Moon
2874,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,similar to those which happen on the Earth is in keeping with the
2875,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"opinions entertained regarding our satellite, Galileo having imagined"
2876,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,that he discovered with his telescope continents and seas on the lunar
2877,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"surface, which led to the belief that the Moon was the abode of"
2878,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,intelligent life.
2879,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2880,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"... and other suns, perhaps,"
2881,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"With their attendant moons, thou wilt descry"
2882,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Communicating male and female light.--viii. 148-50.
2883,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2884,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Milton in these lines refers to Jupiter and Saturn, and their"
2885,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"satellites, which had been recently discovered; those of the former by"
2886,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Galileo, and four of those of the latter by Cassini. The existence of"
2887,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"male and female light was an idea entertained by the ancients, and which"
2888,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"is mentioned by Pliny. The Sun was regarded as a masculine star, and the"
2889,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Moon as feminine; the light emanating from each being similarly
2890,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"distinguished, and possessing different properties."
2891,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2892,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Milton supposes that, as the Earth receives light from the stars, she"
2893,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,returns light back to them. But in his time little was known about the
2894,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"stars, nor was it ascertained how distant they are."
2895,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2896,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"The Angel, in bringing to a conclusion his conversation with Adam, deems"
2897,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,it unadvisable to vouchsafe him a decisive reply to his inquiry
2898,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"regarding the motions of celestial bodies, and in the following lines"
2899,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,gives a beautifully poetical summary of this elevated and philosophic
2900,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,discussion:--
2901,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2902,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"But whether thus these things, or whether not,"
2903,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Whether the Sun, predominant in Heaven,"
2904,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun;"
2905,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"He from the east his flaming round begin,"
2906,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Or she from west her silent course advance
2907,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps
2908,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"On her soft axle, whilst she paces even,"
2909,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,And bears thee soft with the smooth air along--
2910,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Solicit not thy thoughts with matters hid.--viii. 159-67.
2911,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2912,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"In this scientific discourse between Adam and Raphael, in which they"
2913,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,discuss the structural arrangement of the heavens and the motions of
2914,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"celestial bodies, we are afforded an opportunity of learning what exact"
2915,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,and comprehensive knowledge Milton possessed of both the Ptolemaic and
2916,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,Copernican theories. The concise and accurate manner in which he
2917,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,describes the doctrines belonging to each system indicates that he must
2918,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,have devoted considerable time and attention to making himself master of
2919,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"the details associated with both theories, which in his time were the"
2920,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,cause of much controversy and discussion among philosophers and men of
2921,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,science.
2922,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2923,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"The Ptolemaic system, with its crystalline spheres revolving round the"
2924,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"Earth, the addition to those of cycles and epicycles, and the heaping of"
2925,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"them upon each other, in order to account for phenomena associated with"
2926,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"the motions of celestial bodies, are concisely and accurately described."
2927,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,
2928,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"The unreasonableness of this theory, when compared with the Copernican,"
2929,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,is clearly delineated by Milton where Adam is made to express his views
2930,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"with regard to motion in the heavens. His argument, declared in logical"
2931,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"and persuasive language, demonstrates how contrary to reason it would be"
2932,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,to imagine that the entire heavens should revolve round the Earth to
2933,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,bring about a result which could be more easily attained by imparting
2934,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,motion to the Earth herself. The inconceivable velocity with which it
2935,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,would be necessary for the celestial orbs to travel in order to
2936,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,accomplish their daily revolution is described by him as opposed to all
2937,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"reason, and entailing upon them a journey which it would be impossible"
2938,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,for material bodies to perform. None the less accurate is Milton's
2939,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,description of the Copernican system. He describes the Sun as occupying
2940,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,that position in the system which his magnitude and supreme importance
2941,MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE,"claim as his sole right, having the planets with their satellites,"

2956,MILTON AND GALILEO,
2957,MILTON AND GALILEO,
2958,MILTON AND GALILEO,"After the death of his mother, which occurred in 1637, Milton expressed"
2959,MILTON AND GALILEO,"a desire to visit the Continent, where there were many places of"
2960,MILTON AND GALILEO,interest which he often longed to see. Having obtained the consent of
2961,MILTON AND GALILEO,"his kind and indulgent father, he set out on his travels in April 1638,"
2962,MILTON AND GALILEO,"accompanied by a single man-servant, and arrived in Paris, where he only"
2963,MILTON AND GALILEO,stayed a few days. During his residence in the French capital he was
2964,MILTON AND GALILEO,"introduced by Lord Scudamore, the English Ambassador at the Court of"
2965,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Versailles, to Hugo Grotius, one of the most distinguished scholars and"
2966,MILTON AND GALILEO,"philosophic thinkers of his age. From Paris Milton journeyed to Nice,"
2967,MILTON AND GALILEO,where he first beheld the beauty of Italian scenery and the classic
2968,MILTON AND GALILEO,shores of the Mediterranean Sea. From Nice he sailed to Genoa and
2969,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Leghorn, and after a short stay at those places continued his journey to"
2970,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Florence, one of the most interesting and picturesque of Italian cities."
2971,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Situated in the Valley of the Arno, and encircled by sloping hills"
2972,MILTON AND GALILEO,"covered with luxuriant vegetation, the sides of which were studded with"
2973,MILTON AND GALILEO,"residences half-hidden among the foliage of gardens and vineyards,"
2974,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Florence, besides being famed for its natural beauty, was at that time"
2975,MILTON AND GALILEO,"the centre of Italian culture and learning, and the abode of men eminent"
2976,MILTON AND GALILEO,in literature and science. Here Milton remained for a period of two
2977,MILTON AND GALILEO,"months, and enjoyed the friendship and hospitality of its most noted"
2978,MILTON AND GALILEO,"citizens, many of whom delighted to honour their English visitor. He was"
2979,MILTON AND GALILEO,"warmly welcomed by the members of the various literary academies, who"
2980,MILTON AND GALILEO,admired his compositions and conversation; the flattering encomiums
2981,MILTON AND GALILEO,bestowed upon him by those learned societies having been amply repaid by
2982,MILTON AND GALILEO,Milton in choice and elegant Latin verse.
2983,MILTON AND GALILEO,
2984,MILTON AND GALILEO,Among those who resided in the vicinity of Florence was the illustrious
2985,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Galileo, who in his sorrow-stricken old age was held a prisoner of the"
2986,MILTON AND GALILEO,Inquisition for having upheld and taught scientific doctrines which were
2987,MILTON AND GALILEO,declared to be heretical. After his abjuration he was committed to
2988,MILTON AND GALILEO,"prison, but on the intervention of influential friends was released"
2989,MILTON AND GALILEO,"after a few days' incarceration, and permitted to return to his home at"
2990,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Arcetri. He was, however, kept under strict surveillance, and forbidden"
2991,MILTON AND GALILEO,to leave his house or receive any of his intimate friends without having
2992,MILTON AND GALILEO,first obtained the sanction of the ecclesiastical authorities. After
2993,MILTON AND GALILEO,"several years of close confinement at Arcetri, during which time he"
2994,MILTON AND GALILEO,"suffered much from rheumatism and continued ill-health, aggravated by"
2995,MILTON AND GALILEO,grief and mental depression consequent upon the death of his favourite
2996,MILTON AND GALILEO,"daughter, Galileo applied for permission to go to Florence in order to"
2997,MILTON AND GALILEO,place himself under medical treatment. This request was granted by the
2998,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Pope subject to certain conditions, which would be communicated to him"
2999,MILTON AND GALILEO,when he presented himself at the office of the Inquisition at Florence.
3000,MILTON AND GALILEO,These were more severe than he anticipated. He was forbidden to leave
3001,MILTON AND GALILEO,"his house or receive any of his friends there, and those injunctions"
3002,MILTON AND GALILEO,were so strictly adhered to that during Passion Week he had to obtain a
3003,MILTON AND GALILEO,special order so that he might be able to attend mass. At the expiration
3004,MILTON AND GALILEO,"of a few months Galileo was ordered to return to Arcetri, which he never"
3005,MILTON AND GALILEO,left again.
3006,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3007,MILTON AND GALILEO,"An affliction, perhaps the most deplorable that can happen to any human"
3008,MILTON AND GALILEO,"being, was added to the burden of Galileo's misfortunes and woes. A"
3009,MILTON AND GALILEO,disorder which had some years previously injured the sight of his right
3010,MILTON AND GALILEO,eye returned in 1636. In the following year the left eye became
3011,MILTON AND GALILEO,"similarly affected, with the result that in a few months Galileo became"
3012,MILTON AND GALILEO,"totally blind. His friends at first hoped that the disease was cataract,"
3013,MILTON AND GALILEO,and that some relief might be afforded by means of an operation; but it
3014,MILTON AND GALILEO,"was discovered to be an opacity of the cornea, which at his age was"
3015,MILTON AND GALILEO,considered unamenable to treatment. This sudden and unexpected calamity
3016,MILTON AND GALILEO,"was to Galileo a most deplorable occurrence, for it necessitated the"
3017,MILTON AND GALILEO,"relinquishment of his favourite pursuit, which he followed with such"
3018,MILTON AND GALILEO,intense interest and delight. His friend Castelli writes: 'The noblest
3019,MILTON AND GALILEO,"eye is darkened which Nature ever made; an eye so privileged, and gifted"
3020,MILTON AND GALILEO,with such rare qualities that it may with truth be said to have seen
3021,MILTON AND GALILEO,"more than all of those eyes who are gone, and to have opened the eyes of"
3022,MILTON AND GALILEO,all who are to come.' Galileo endured his affliction with patient
3023,MILTON AND GALILEO,"resignation and fortitude, and in the following extract from a letter by"
3024,MILTON AND GALILEO,him he acknowledges the chastening hand of a Divine Providence: 'Alas!
3025,MILTON AND GALILEO,"your dear friend and servant Galileo has become totally blind, so that"
3026,MILTON AND GALILEO,"this heaven, this earth, this universe, which with wonderful"
3027,MILTON AND GALILEO,observations I had enlarged a hundred and a thousand times beyond the
3028,MILTON AND GALILEO,"belief of bygone ages, henceforward for me is shrunk into the narrow"
3029,MILTON AND GALILEO,space which I myself fill in it. So it pleases God; it shall then please
3030,MILTON AND GALILEO,me also.' The rigorous curtailment of his liberty which prompted Galileo
3031,MILTON AND GALILEO,"to head his letters, 'From my prison at Arcetri,' was relaxed when total"
3032,MILTON AND GALILEO,blindness had supervened upon the infirmities of age. Permission was
3033,MILTON AND GALILEO,"given him to receive his friends, and he was allowed to have free"
3034,MILTON AND GALILEO,intercourse with his neighbours.
3035,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3036,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Milton, during his stay at Florence, visited Galileo at Arcetri. We are"
3037,MILTON AND GALILEO,ignorant of the details of this eventful and interesting interview
3038,MILTON AND GALILEO,"between the aged and blind astronomer and the young English poet, who"
3039,MILTON AND GALILEO,"afterwards immortalised his name in heroic verse, and who in his"
3040,MILTON AND GALILEO,declining years suffered from an affliction similar to that which befel
3041,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Galileo, and to which he alludes so pathetically in the following"
3042,MILTON AND GALILEO,lines:--
3043,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3044,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Thee I revisit safe,"
3045,MILTON AND GALILEO,And feel thy sovran vital lamp; but thou
3046,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Revisitest not these eyes, that roll in vain"
3047,MILTON AND GALILEO,"To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn;"
3048,MILTON AND GALILEO,"So thick a drop serene hath quenched their orbs,"
3049,MILTON AND GALILEO,Or dim suffusion veiled.--iii. 21-26.
3050,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3051,MILTON AND GALILEO,"We can imagine that Galileo's astronomical views, which at that time"
3052,MILTON AND GALILEO,were the subject of much discussion among scientific men and professors
3053,MILTON AND GALILEO,"of religion, and on account of which he suffered persecution, were"
3054,MILTON AND GALILEO,eagerly discussed. It is also probable that the information communicated
3055,MILTON AND GALILEO,"by Galileo, or by some of his followers, may have persuaded Milton to"
3056,MILTON AND GALILEO,entertain a more favourable opinion of the Copernican theory. The
3057,MILTON AND GALILEO,interesting discoveries made by Galileo with his telescope without doubt
3058,MILTON AND GALILEO,"formed a pleasant subject of conversation, and Milton enjoyed the"
3059,MILTON AND GALILEO,privilege of listening to a detailed description of these from the lips
3060,MILTON AND GALILEO,"of the aged astronomer. The telescope, its principle, its mechanism, and"
3061,MILTON AND GALILEO,"the method of observing, were most probably explained to him; and we can"
3062,MILTON AND GALILEO,believe that an opportunity was afforded him of examining those in
3063,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Galileo's observatory, and of perhaps testing their magnifying power"
3064,MILTON AND GALILEO,upon some celestial object favourably situated for observation. Though
3065,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Milton has not favoured us with any details of his visit to Galileo, yet"
3066,MILTON AND GALILEO,"it was one which made a lasting impression upon his mind, and was never"
3067,MILTON AND GALILEO,"afterwards forgotten by him. 'There it was,' he writes, 'I found and"
3068,MILTON AND GALILEO,"visited the famous Galileo, grown old, a prisoner of the Inquisition for"
3069,MILTON AND GALILEO,thinking in astronomy otherwise than the Franciscan and Dominican
3070,MILTON AND GALILEO,"licensers thought.' In years long after, when Milton, himself feeble"
3071,MILTON AND GALILEO,"and blind, sat down to compose his 'Paradise Lost,' the remembrance of"
3072,MILTON AND GALILEO,the Tuscan artist and his telescope was still fresh in his memory.
3073,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3074,MILTON AND GALILEO,By the invention of the telescope and its application to astronomical
3075,MILTON AND GALILEO,"research, a vast amount of information and additional detail have been"
3076,MILTON AND GALILEO,learned regarding the bodies which enter into the formation of the solar
3077,MILTON AND GALILEO,system; and by its aid many new ones were also discovered. On sweeping
3078,MILTON AND GALILEO,"the heavens with the instrument, the illimitable extent of the sidereal"
3079,MILTON AND GALILEO,"universe became apparent, and numberless objects of interest were"
3080,MILTON AND GALILEO,brought within the range of vision the existence of which had not been
3081,MILTON AND GALILEO,previously imagined.
3082,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3083,MILTON AND GALILEO,The Galilean telescope was invented in 1609. But the magnifying power of
3084,MILTON AND GALILEO,"certain lenses, and their combination in producing singular visual"
3085,MILTON AND GALILEO,"effects, are alluded to in the writings of several early authors. The"
3086,MILTON AND GALILEO,"value of single lenses as an aid to sight had been long known, and"
3087,MILTON AND GALILEO,spectacles were in common use in the fourteenth century. Several
3088,MILTON AND GALILEO,mathematicians have described the wonderful optical results obtained
3089,MILTON AND GALILEO,"from glasses concave and convex, of parabolic and circular forms, and"
3090,MILTON AND GALILEO,"from 'perspective glasses,' in which were embodied the principle of the"
3091,MILTON AND GALILEO,"telescope. It is asserted that our countryman, Roger Bacon (1214), had"
3092,MILTON AND GALILEO,some notion of the properties of the telescope; but among those familiar
3093,MILTON AND GALILEO,with the combination of lenses the two men who made the nearest approach
3094,MILTON AND GALILEO,to the invention of the instrument were Baptista Porta and Gerolamo
3095,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Fracastro. The latter, who died in 1553, writes as follows: 'For which"
3096,MILTON AND GALILEO,reason those things which are seen at the bottom of water appear greater
3097,MILTON AND GALILEO,than those which are at the top; and if anyone look through two
3098,MILTON AND GALILEO,"eye-glasses, one placed upon the other, he will see everything much"
3099,MILTON AND GALILEO,larger and nearer.' It is doubtful if Fracastro had any notion of
3100,MILTON AND GALILEO,constructing a mechanism which might answer the purpose of a telescopic
3101,MILTON AND GALILEO,tube. Baptista Porta (1611) is more explicit in what he describes. He
3102,MILTON AND GALILEO,"writes: 'Concave lenses show distant objects most clearly, convex those"
3103,MILTON AND GALILEO,which are nearer; whence they may be used to assist the sight. With a
3104,MILTON AND GALILEO,"concave glass distant objects will be seen, small, but distinct; with a"
3105,MILTON AND GALILEO,"convex one, those near at hand, larger, but confused; if you know"
3106,MILTON AND GALILEO,"_rightly_ how to combine one of each sort, you will see both far and"
3107,MILTON AND GALILEO,near objects larger and clearer.' He then goes on to say: 'I shall now
3108,MILTON AND GALILEO,endeavour to show in what manner we may continue to recognise our
3109,MILTON AND GALILEO,"friends at the distance of several miles, and how those of weak sight"
3110,MILTON AND GALILEO,may read the most minute letters from a distance. It is an invention of
3111,MILTON AND GALILEO,"great utility, and grounded on optical principles; nor is at all"
3112,MILTON AND GALILEO,difficult of execution; but it must be so divulged as not to be
3113,MILTON AND GALILEO,"understood by the vulgar, and yet be clear to the sharp-sighted.' After"
3114,MILTON AND GALILEO,"this, he proceeds to describe a mechanism the details of which are"
3115,MILTON AND GALILEO,"confusing and unintelligible, nor did it appear to bear any resemblance"
3116,MILTON AND GALILEO,to a telescopic tube.
3117,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3118,MILTON AND GALILEO,"In a work published by Thomas Digges in 1591, he makes the following"
3119,MILTON AND GALILEO,"allusion to his father's experiments with the lenses: 'My father, by his"
3120,MILTON AND GALILEO,"continuall painfull practices, assisted with demonstrations"
3121,MILTON AND GALILEO,"mathematicall, was able, and sundry times hath by proportionall glasses,"
3122,MILTON AND GALILEO,"duely situate in convenient angles, not only discouered things farre"
3123,MILTON AND GALILEO,"off, read letters, numbered peeces of money with the verye coyne and"
3124,MILTON AND GALILEO,"superscription thereof cast by some of his freends of purpose, upon"
3125,MILTON AND GALILEO,"downes in open fields; but also seuen miles off, declared what hath beene"
3126,MILTON AND GALILEO,doone at that instant in priuate places.' It must be admitted that if
3127,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Leonard Digges had not constructed a telescope, he knew how to combine"
3128,MILTON AND GALILEO,lenses by the aid of which a visual effect was created similar to that
3129,MILTON AND GALILEO,produced by the use of the instrument.
3130,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3131,MILTON AND GALILEO,"The inventor of the telescope was a Dutchman named Hans Lippershey, who"
3132,MILTON AND GALILEO,carried on the business of a spectacle-maker in the town of Middelburg.
3133,MILTON AND GALILEO,His discovery was purely accidental. It is said that the
3134,MILTON AND GALILEO,"instrument--which was directed towards a weather-cock on a church spire,"
3135,MILTON AND GALILEO,of which it gave a large and inverted image--was for some time exhibited
3136,MILTON AND GALILEO,in his shop as a curiosity before its importance was recognised. The
3137,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Marquis Spinola, happening to see this philosophical toy, purchased it,"
3138,MILTON AND GALILEO,"and presented it to Prince Maurice of Nassau, who imagined it might be"
3139,MILTON AND GALILEO,of service for the purpose of military reconnoitring. The value of the
3140,MILTON AND GALILEO,"invention was, however, soon realised, and in the following year"
3141,MILTON AND GALILEO,"telescopes were sold in Paris. In 1609, Galileo, when on a visit to a"
3142,MILTON AND GALILEO,"friend at Venice, received intelligence of the invention of an"
3143,MILTON AND GALILEO,instrument by a Dutch optician which possessed the power of causing
3144,MILTON AND GALILEO,distant objects to appear much nearer than when observed by ordinary
3145,MILTON AND GALILEO,vision. The accuracy of this information was confirmed by letters which
3146,MILTON AND GALILEO,"he received from Paris; and this general report, Galileo asserted, was"
3147,MILTON AND GALILEO,"all he knew of the subject. Fuccarius, in a disparaging letter, says"
3148,MILTON AND GALILEO,"that one of the Dutch telescopes had been brought to Venice, and that he"
3149,MILTON AND GALILEO,himself had seen it. This statement is not incompatible with Galileo's
3150,MILTON AND GALILEO,"affirmation that he had not seen the original instrument, and knew no"
3151,MILTON AND GALILEO,more about it than what had been communicated to him in the letters from
3152,MILTON AND GALILEO,the French capital. It was insinuated by Fuccarius that Galileo had seen
3153,MILTON AND GALILEO,"the telescope at Venice, but, as he denied this, we should not hesitate"
3154,MILTON AND GALILEO,to believe in his veracity.
3155,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3156,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Immediately after his return to Padua, Galileo began to think how he"
3157,MILTON AND GALILEO,might be able to contrive an instrument with properties similar to the
3158,MILTON AND GALILEO,one of which he had been informed; and in the following words describes
3159,MILTON AND GALILEO,the process of reasoning by which he arrived at a successful result: 'I
3160,MILTON AND GALILEO,argued in the following manner. The contrivance consists either of one
3161,MILTON AND GALILEO,"glass or of more--one is not sufficient, since it must be either convex,"
3162,MILTON AND GALILEO,"concave, or plane. The last does not produce any sensible alteration in"
3163,MILTON AND GALILEO,objects; the concave diminishes them. It is true that the convex
3164,MILTON AND GALILEO,"magnifies, but it renders them confused and indistinct; consequently,"
3165,MILTON AND GALILEO,one glass is insufficient to produce the desired effect. Proceeding to
3166,MILTON AND GALILEO,"consider two glasses, and bearing in mind that the plane causes no"
3167,MILTON AND GALILEO,"change, I determined that the instrument could not consist of the"
3168,MILTON AND GALILEO,combination of a plane glass with either of the other two. I therefore
3169,MILTON AND GALILEO,applied myself to make experiments on combinations of the two other
3170,MILTON AND GALILEO,"kinds, and thus obtained that of which I was in search.' Galileo's"
3171,MILTON AND GALILEO,"telescope consisted of two lenses--one plano-convex, the other"
3172,MILTON AND GALILEO,"plano-concave, the latter being held next the eye. These he fixed in a"
3173,MILTON AND GALILEO,"piece of organ pipe, which served the purpose of a tube, the glasses"
3174,MILTON AND GALILEO,being distant from each other by the difference of their focal lengths.
3175,MILTON AND GALILEO,An exactly similar principle is adopted in the construction of an
3176,MILTON AND GALILEO,"opera-glass, which can be accurately described as a double Galilean"
3177,MILTON AND GALILEO,telescope. Galileo must be regarded as the inventor of this kind of
3178,MILTON AND GALILEO,"telescope, which in one respect differed very materially from the one"
3179,MILTON AND GALILEO,constructed by the Dutch optician. If what has been said with regard to
3180,MILTON AND GALILEO,"the _inverted_ weather-cock be true, then Lippershey's telescope was"
3181,MILTON AND GALILEO,"made with two convex lenses, distant from each other by the sum of their"
3182,MILTON AND GALILEO,"focal lengths, and all objects observed with it were seen inverted."
3183,MILTON AND GALILEO,Refracting astronomical telescopes are now constructed on this
3184,MILTON AND GALILEO,"principle, it having been discovered that for observational purposes"
3185,MILTON AND GALILEO,they possess several advantages over the Galilean instrument. When
3186,MILTON AND GALILEO,Galileo had completed his first telescope he returned with it to
3187,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Venice, where he exhibited it to his friends. The sensation created by"
3188,MILTON AND GALILEO,"this small instrument, which magnified only three times, was most"
3189,MILTON AND GALILEO,"extraordinary, and almost amounted to a frenzy. Crowds of the principal"
3190,MILTON AND GALILEO,citizens of Venice flocked to Galileo's house in order that they might
3191,MILTON AND GALILEO,see the magical tube about which such wonderful reports were circulated;
3192,MILTON AND GALILEO,and for upwards of a month he was daily occupied in describing his
3193,MILTON AND GALILEO,invention to attentive audiences. At the expiration of this time the
3194,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Doge of Venice, Leonardo Deodati, hinted that the Senate would not be"
3195,MILTON AND GALILEO,averse to receive the telescope as a gift. Galileo readily acquiesced
3196,MILTON AND GALILEO,"with this desire, and, as an acknowledgment of his merits, a decree was"
3197,MILTON AND GALILEO,"issued confirming his appointment as professor at Padua for life, and"
3198,MILTON AND GALILEO,"increasing his salary from 500 to 1,000 florins. The public excitement"
3199,MILTON AND GALILEO,created by the telescope showed no signs of abatement. Sirturi mentions
3200,MILTON AND GALILEO,"that, having succeeded in constructing an instrument, he ascended the"
3201,MILTON AND GALILEO,"tower of St. Mark's at Venice, hoping to be able to use it there without"
3202,MILTON AND GALILEO,"interruption. He was, however, detected by a few individuals, and soon"
3203,MILTON AND GALILEO,"surrounded by a crowd, which took possession of his telescope, and"
3204,MILTON AND GALILEO,detained him for several hours until their curiosity was satisfied.
3205,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Eager inquiries having been made as to where he lodged, Sirturi, fearing"
3206,MILTON AND GALILEO,"a repetition of his experience in the church tower, decided to quit"
3207,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Venice early next morning, and betake himself to a quieter and less"
3208,MILTON AND GALILEO,frequented neighbourhood.
3209,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3210,MILTON AND GALILEO,The instrument was at first called Galileo's tube; the double eye-glass;
3211,MILTON AND GALILEO,the perspective; the trunk; the cylinder. The appellation _telescope_
3212,MILTON AND GALILEO,was given it by Demisiano.
3213,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3214,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Galileo next directed his attention to the construction of telescopes,"
3215,MILTON AND GALILEO,"and applied his mechanical skill in making instruments of a larger size,"
3216,MILTON AND GALILEO,"one of which magnified _eight_ times. 'And at length,' he writes,"
3217,MILTON AND GALILEO,"'sparing neither labour nor expense, he completed an instrument that was"
3218,MILTON AND GALILEO,capable of magnifying more than _thirty_ times.'
3219,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3220,MILTON AND GALILEO,Galileo now commenced an exploration of the celestial regions with his
3221,MILTON AND GALILEO,"telescope, and on carefully examining some of the heavenly bodies, made"
3222,MILTON AND GALILEO,many wonderful discoveries which added greatly to the fame and lustre of
3223,MILTON AND GALILEO,his name.
3224,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3225,MILTON AND GALILEO,The first celestial object to which Galileo directed his telescope was
3226,MILTON AND GALILEO,the Moon. He was deeply interested to find how much her surface
3227,MILTON AND GALILEO,"resembled that of the Earth, and was able to perceive lofty mountain"
3228,MILTON AND GALILEO,"ranges, the illumined peaks of which reflected the sunlight, whilst"
3229,MILTON AND GALILEO,their bases and sides were still enveloped in dark shadow; great plains
3230,MILTON AND GALILEO,"which he imagined were seas, valleys, elevated ridges, depressions, and"
3231,MILTON AND GALILEO,inequalities similar to what are found on our globe. Galileo believed
3232,MILTON AND GALILEO,"the Moon to be a habitable world, and concluded that the dark and"
3233,MILTON AND GALILEO,"luminous portions of her surface were land and water, which reflected"
3234,MILTON AND GALILEO,with unequal intensity the light of the Sun. The followers of Aristotle
3235,MILTON AND GALILEO,received the announcement of these discoveries with much displeasure.
3236,MILTON AND GALILEO,They maintained that the Moon was perfectly spherical and smooth--a vast
3237,MILTON AND GALILEO,"mirror, the dark portions of which were the reflection of our"
3238,MILTON AND GALILEO,terrestrial mountains and forests--and accused Galileo 'of taking a
3239,MILTON AND GALILEO,delight in distorting and ruining the fairest works of Nature.' He
3240,MILTON AND GALILEO,"appealed to the unequal condition of the surface of our globe, but this"
3241,MILTON AND GALILEO,was of no avail in altering their preconceived notions of the lunar
3242,MILTON AND GALILEO,surface.
3243,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3244,MILTON AND GALILEO,Perhaps the most important discovery made by Galileo with the telescope
3245,MILTON AND GALILEO,"was that of the four moons of Jupiter. On the night of January 7, 1610,"
3246,MILTON AND GALILEO,"when engaged in observing the planet, his attention was attracted by"
3247,MILTON AND GALILEO,three small stars which appeared brighter than those in their immediate
3248,MILTON AND GALILEO,neighbourhood. They were all in a straight line and parallel with the
3249,MILTON AND GALILEO,"ecliptic; two of them were situated to the east, and one to the west of"
3250,MILTON AND GALILEO,Jupiter. On the following night he was surprised to find all three to
3251,MILTON AND GALILEO,"the west of the planet, and nearer to each other. This caused him"
3252,MILTON AND GALILEO,"considerable perplexity, and he was at a loss to understand how Jupiter"
3253,MILTON AND GALILEO,"could be east of the three stars, when on the preceding night he was"
3254,MILTON AND GALILEO,observed to the west of two of them. Galileo was unable to reconcile the
3255,MILTON AND GALILEO,altered positions of those bodies with the apparent motion of Jupiter
3256,MILTON AND GALILEO,among the fixed stars as indicated by the astronomical tables. The next
3257,MILTON AND GALILEO,"opportunity he had of observing them was on the 10th, when two stars"
3258,MILTON AND GALILEO,"only were visible, and they were to the east of the planet. As it was"
3259,MILTON AND GALILEO,impossible for Jupiter to move from west to east on January 8 and from
3260,MILTON AND GALILEO,"east to west on the 10th, he concluded that it was the motion of the"
3261,MILTON AND GALILEO,stars and not that of Jupiter which accounted for the observed
3262,MILTON AND GALILEO,phenomena. Galileo watched the stars attentively on successive evenings
3263,MILTON AND GALILEO,"and discovered a fourth, and on observing how they changed their"
3264,MILTON AND GALILEO,positions relatively to each other he soon arrived at the conclusion
3265,MILTON AND GALILEO,that the stars were four moons which revolved round Jupiter after the
3266,MILTON AND GALILEO,manner in which the Moon revolves round the Earth. Having assured
3267,MILTON AND GALILEO,himself that the four new stars were four moons that with periodical
3268,MILTON AND GALILEO,"regularity circled round the great planet, Galileo named them the"
3269,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Medicean Stars in honour of his patron, Cosmo de' Medici, Grand Duke of"
3270,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Tuscany. He also published an essay entitled 'Nuncius Sidereus,' or the"
3271,MILTON AND GALILEO,"'Sidereal Messenger,' which contained an account of this important"
3272,MILTON AND GALILEO,discovery.
3273,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3274,MILTON AND GALILEO,The announcement of Galileo's discovery of the four satellites of
3275,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Jupiter created a profound sensation, and its significance became at"
3276,MILTON AND GALILEO,once apparent. Aristotelians and Ptolemaists received the information
3277,MILTON AND GALILEO,"with much disfavour and incredulity, and many persons positively refused"
3278,MILTON AND GALILEO,"to believe Galileo, whom they accused of inventing fables. On the other"
3279,MILTON AND GALILEO,"hand, the upholders of the Copernican theory hailed it with"
3280,MILTON AND GALILEO,"satisfaction, as it declared that Jupiter with his four moons"
3281,MILTON AND GALILEO,constituted a system of greater magnitude and importance than that of
3282,MILTON AND GALILEO,"our globe with her single satellite, and that consequently the Earth"
3283,MILTON AND GALILEO,could not be regarded as the centre of the universe.
3284,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3285,MILTON AND GALILEO,"When Kepler heard of this remarkable discovery, he wrote to Galileo and"
3286,MILTON AND GALILEO,expressed himself in the following characteristic manner: 'I was sitting
3287,MILTON AND GALILEO,"idle at home thinking of you, most excellent Galileo, and your letters,"
3288,MILTON AND GALILEO,when the news was brought me of the discovery of four planets by the
3289,MILTON AND GALILEO,help of the double eye-glass. Wachenfels stopped his carriage at my door
3290,MILTON AND GALILEO,"to tell me, when such a fit of wonder seized me at a report which seemed"
3291,MILTON AND GALILEO,"so very absurd, and I was thrown into such agitation at seeing an old"
3292,MILTON AND GALILEO,"dispute between us decided in this way, that between his joy, my"
3293,MILTON AND GALILEO,"colouring, and the laughter of both, confounded as we were by such a"
3294,MILTON AND GALILEO,"novelty, we were hardly capable, he of speaking, or I of listening.... I"
3295,MILTON AND GALILEO,am so far from disbelieving in the existence of the four circumjovial
3296,MILTON AND GALILEO,"planets, that I long for a telescope to anticipate you, if possible, in"
3297,MILTON AND GALILEO,"discovering two round Mars (as the proportion seems to me to require),"
3298,MILTON AND GALILEO,"six or eight round Saturn, and perhaps one each round Mercury and"
3299,MILTON AND GALILEO,Venus.' The intelligence of Galileo's discoveries was received by his
3300,MILTON AND GALILEO,opponents in a spirit entirely different from that manifested by Kepler.
3301,MILTON AND GALILEO,"The principal professor of philosophy at Padua, when requested to look"
3302,MILTON AND GALILEO,"at the Moon and planets through Galileo's glass, persistently declined,"
3303,MILTON AND GALILEO,and did his utmost to persuade the Grand Duke that the four satellites
3304,MILTON AND GALILEO,"of Jupiter could not possibly exist. Francesco Sizzi, a Florentine"
3305,MILTON AND GALILEO,"astronomer, argued that, as there are seven apertures in the head,"
3306,MILTON AND GALILEO,"seven known metals, and seven days in the week, so there could only be"
3307,MILTON AND GALILEO,"seven planets. To these absurd remarks Galileo replied by saying that,"
3308,MILTON AND GALILEO,'whatever their force might be as a reason for believing beforehand that
3309,MILTON AND GALILEO,"no more than seven planets would be discovered, they hardly seemed of"
3310,MILTON AND GALILEO,sufficient weight to destroy the new ones when actually seen.' Another
3311,MILTON AND GALILEO,"individual, named Christmann, writes: 'We are not to think that Jupiter"
3312,MILTON AND GALILEO,"has four satellites given him by Nature in order, by revolving round"
3313,MILTON AND GALILEO,"him, to immortalize the name of the Medici, who first had notice of the"
3314,MILTON AND GALILEO,"observation. These are the dreams of idle men, who love ludicrous ideas"
3315,MILTON AND GALILEO,better than our laborious and industrious correction of the heavens.
3316,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Nature abhors so horrible a chaos, and to the truly wise such vanity is"
3317,MILTON AND GALILEO,"detestable.' Martin Horky, a _protégé_ of Kepler's, issued a pamphlet in"
3318,MILTON AND GALILEO,which he made a violent attack on Galileo. He says: 'I will never
3319,MILTON AND GALILEO,concede his four new planets to that Italian from Padua though I die for
3320,MILTON AND GALILEO,"it.' He then asks the following questions, and replies to them himself:"
3321,MILTON AND GALILEO,(1) Whether they exist? (2) What they are? (3) What they are like? (4)
3322,MILTON AND GALILEO,Why they are? 'The first question is soon disposed of by Horky's
3323,MILTON AND GALILEO,declaring positively that he has examined the heavens with Galileo's own
3324,MILTON AND GALILEO,"glass, and that no such thing as a satellite about Jupiter exists. To"
3325,MILTON AND GALILEO,"the second, he declared solemnly that he does not more surely know that"
3326,MILTON AND GALILEO,he has a soul in his body than that reflected rays are the sole cause of
3327,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Galileo's erroneous observations. In regard to the third question, he"
3328,MILTON AND GALILEO,says that these planets are like the smallest fly compared to an
3329,MILTON AND GALILEO,"elephant; and, finally, concludes on the fourth, that the only use of"
3330,MILTON AND GALILEO,"them is to gratify Galileo's ""thirst of gold,"" and to afford himself a"
3331,MILTON AND GALILEO,subject of discussion.'[7] Galileo did not condescend to take any notice
3332,MILTON AND GALILEO,"of this scurrilous production; but Horky, who imagined that he had done"
3333,MILTON AND GALILEO,"something clever, sent a copy of his pamphlet to Kepler. In a few days"
3334,MILTON AND GALILEO,"after he called to see him, and was received with such a storm of"
3335,MILTON AND GALILEO,indignation that he begged for mercy and implored his forgiveness.
3336,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Kepler forgave him, but insisted on his making amends. He writes: 'I"
3337,MILTON AND GALILEO,"have taken him again into favour upon this preliminary condition, to"
3338,MILTON AND GALILEO,"which he has agreed--that I am to show him Jupiter's satellites, _and he"
3339,MILTON AND GALILEO,"is to see them_, and own that they are there.'"
3340,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3341,MILTON AND GALILEO,The evidence in support of the existence of Jupiter's satellites became
3342,MILTON AND GALILEO,so conclusive that the opponents of Galileo were compelled to renounce
3343,MILTON AND GALILEO,"their disbelief in those bodies, whether real or pretended. The Grand"
3344,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Duke, preferring to trust to his eyes rather than believe in the"
3345,MILTON AND GALILEO,"arguments of the professor at Padua, observed the satellites on several"
3346,MILTON AND GALILEO,"occasions, along with Galileo, at Pisa, and on his departure bestowed"
3347,MILTON AND GALILEO,"upon him a gift of one thousand florins. Several of Galileo's enemies,"
3348,MILTON AND GALILEO,"as a result of their observations, now arrived at the conclusion that"
3349,MILTON AND GALILEO,"his discovery was incomplete, and that Jupiter had more than four"
3350,MILTON AND GALILEO,"satellites in attendance upon him. Scheiner counted five, Rheita nine,"
3351,MILTON AND GALILEO,and other observers increased the number to twelve. But it was found to
3352,MILTON AND GALILEO,be quite as hazardous to exceed the number stated by Galileo as it was
3353,MILTON AND GALILEO,"to deny the existence of any; for, when Jupiter had traversed a short"
3354,MILTON AND GALILEO,"distance of his path among the fixed stars, the only bodies that"
3355,MILTON AND GALILEO,"accompanied him were his four original attendants, which continued to"
3356,MILTON AND GALILEO,revolve round him with unerring regularity in every part of his orbit.
3357,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3358,MILTON AND GALILEO,Galileo did not afford his opponents much time to oppose or controvert
3359,MILTON AND GALILEO,with argument the discoveries made by him with the telescope before his
3360,MILTON AND GALILEO,announcement of a new one attracted public attention from those already
3361,MILTON AND GALILEO,"known. He, however, exercised greater caution in disclosing the results"
3362,MILTON AND GALILEO,"of his observations, as other persons laid claim to having made similar"
3363,MILTON AND GALILEO,discoveries prior to the time at which his were announced. He therefore
3364,MILTON AND GALILEO,"adopted a method in common use among astronomers in those days, by which"
3365,MILTON AND GALILEO,the letters in a sentence announcing a discovery were transposed so as
3366,MILTON AND GALILEO,to form an anagram.
3367,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3368,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Galileo announced his next discovery in this manner, and which read as"
3369,MILTON AND GALILEO,follows:--
3370,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3371,MILTON AND GALILEO,Smaismrmilme poeta leumi bvne nugttaviras.
3372,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3373,MILTON AND GALILEO,"This, when deciphered, formed the sentence:--"
3374,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3375,MILTON AND GALILEO,Altissimum planetam tergeminum observavi.
3376,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3377,MILTON AND GALILEO,I have observed that the remotest planet is triple.
3378,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3379,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Galileo perceived that Saturn presented a triform appearance, and that,"
3380,MILTON AND GALILEO,"instead of one body, there were three, all in a straight line, and"
3381,MILTON AND GALILEO,"apparently in contact with each other, the middle one being larger than"
3382,MILTON AND GALILEO,the two lateral ones. In a letter to Kepler he remarked: 'Now I have
3383,MILTON AND GALILEO,"discovered a Court for Jupiter, and two servants for this old man, who"
3384,MILTON AND GALILEO,"aid his steps and never quit his side.' Kepler, who excelled as an"
3385,MILTON AND GALILEO,"imaginative writer, replied: 'I will not make an old man of Saturn, nor"
3386,MILTON AND GALILEO,slaves of his attendant globes; but rather let this tricorporate form be
3387,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Geryon--so shall Galileo be Hercules, and the telescope his club, armed"
3388,MILTON AND GALILEO,"with which he has conquered that distant planet, and dragged him from"
3389,MILTON AND GALILEO,"the remotest depths of Nature, and exposed him to the view of all.'"
3390,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Continuing his observations, Galileo perceived that the two lateral"
3391,MILTON AND GALILEO,"objects gradually decreased in size, and at the expiration of two years"
3392,MILTON AND GALILEO,"entirely disappeared, leaving the central globe visible only. He was"
3393,MILTON AND GALILEO,"unable to assign any reason for this peculiar occurrence, which caused"
3394,MILTON AND GALILEO,"him much perplexity, and he expresses himself thus: 'What is to be said"
3395,MILTON AND GALILEO,concerning so strange a metamorphosis? Are the two lesser stars consumed
3396,MILTON AND GALILEO,after the manner of the solar spots? Have they vanished and suddenly
3397,MILTON AND GALILEO,"fled? Has Saturn, perhaps, devoured his own children? Or were the"
3398,MILTON AND GALILEO,"appearances, indeed, illusion or fraud, with which the glasses have so"
3399,MILTON AND GALILEO,"long deceived me, as well as many others to whom I have shown them? Now,"
3400,MILTON AND GALILEO,"perhaps, is the time to revive the well-nigh withered hopes of those"
3401,MILTON AND GALILEO,"who, guided by more profound contemplations, have discovered the fallacy"
3402,MILTON AND GALILEO,"of the new observations, and demonstrated the utter impossibility of"
3403,MILTON AND GALILEO,"their existence. I do not know what to say in a case so surprising, so"
3404,MILTON AND GALILEO,"unlooked-for, and so novel. The shortness of the time, the unexpected"
3405,MILTON AND GALILEO,"nature of the event, the weakness of my understanding, and the fear of"
3406,MILTON AND GALILEO,"being mistaken, have greatly confounded me.' After a certain interval"
3407,MILTON AND GALILEO,those bodies reappeared; but Galileo's glass was not sufficiently
3408,MILTON AND GALILEO,"powerful to enable him to ascertain their nature nor solve the mystery,"
3409,MILTON AND GALILEO,which for upwards of half a century perplexed the ablest astronomers.
3410,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3411,MILTON AND GALILEO,The elucidation of this inexplicable phenomenon was reserved for
3412,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Christian Huygens, who, with an improved telescope of his own"
3413,MILTON AND GALILEO,"construction, was able to declare that Saturn's appendages were portions"
3414,MILTON AND GALILEO,"of a ring which surrounds the planet, and is everywhere distinct from"
3415,MILTON AND GALILEO,its surface.
3416,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3417,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Galileo next directed his attention to the planet Venus, and as a result"
3418,MILTON AND GALILEO,of his observations was led to communicate to the public another
3419,MILTON AND GALILEO,anagram:--
3420,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3421,MILTON AND GALILEO,Haec immatura a me jam frustra leguntur oy.
3422,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3423,MILTON AND GALILEO,"This, when rendered correctly, reads:--"
3424,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3425,MILTON AND GALILEO,Cynthiae figuras aemulatur mater amorum.
3426,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3427,MILTON AND GALILEO,Venus rivals the appearances of the Moon.
3428,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3429,MILTON AND GALILEO,The phases of Venus were one of the most interesting of Galileo's
3430,MILTON AND GALILEO,discoveries with the telescope. When observed near inferior conjunction
3431,MILTON AND GALILEO,"the planet presents the appearance of a slender crescent, resembling"
3432,MILTON AND GALILEO,the Moon when a few days old. Travelling from this point to superior
3433,MILTON AND GALILEO,"conjunction, the illumined portion of her disc gradually increases,"
3434,MILTON AND GALILEO,"until it becomes circular, like the full Moon. This changing appearance"
3435,MILTON AND GALILEO,of Venus afforded Galileo irresistible proof that the planet is an
3436,MILTON AND GALILEO,"opaque body, which derives its light from the Sun, and that it circles"
3437,MILTON AND GALILEO,round the orb--convincing evidence of the accuracy and truthfulness of
3438,MILTON AND GALILEO,the Copernican theory.
3439,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3440,MILTON AND GALILEO,It was in this manner that Galileo announced his discovery of the phases
3441,MILTON AND GALILEO,"of Venus, the peerless planet of our morning and evening skies, whose"
3442,MILTON AND GALILEO,"slender crescent forms such a beautiful object in the telescope, and"
3443,MILTON AND GALILEO,"who, as she traverses her orbit, exhibits all the varied changes of form"
3444,MILTON AND GALILEO,presented by the Moon in her monthly journey round the Earth. These
3445,MILTON AND GALILEO,"varying aspects of Venus were not unknown to Milton; and, indeed, he may"
3446,MILTON AND GALILEO,have been informed of them by Galileo in his conversation with him at
3447,MILTON AND GALILEO,Arcetri; nor has he failed to introduce an allusion to this beautiful
3448,MILTON AND GALILEO,"phenomenon in his poem. In his description of the Creation, after the"
3449,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Sun was formed, he adds:--"
3450,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3451,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Hither, as to their fountain, other stars"
3452,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Repairing, in their golden urns draw light,"
3453,MILTON AND GALILEO,And hence the morning planet gilds her horns.--vii. 364-66.
3454,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3455,MILTON AND GALILEO,Galileo also discovered that the planet Mars does not always present the
3456,MILTON AND GALILEO,appearance of a circular disc. When near opposition the full disc of the
3457,MILTON AND GALILEO,"planet is visible, but at all other times it is gibbous, and approaches"
3458,MILTON AND GALILEO,nearest to that of a half-moon when at the quadratures.
3459,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3460,MILTON AND GALILEO,"In the year 1610, on directing his telescope to the Sun, Galileo"
3461,MILTON AND GALILEO,"detected dark spots on the solar disc. Similar spots, sufficiently large"
3462,MILTON AND GALILEO,"to be distinguished by the naked eye, had been observed from time to"
3463,MILTON AND GALILEO,"time for centuries prior to the invention of the telescope, but nothing"
3464,MILTON AND GALILEO,"was known of their nature. In 1609 Kepler observed a spot on the Sun,"
3465,MILTON AND GALILEO,which he thought was the planet Mercury in conjunction with the orb; the
3466,MILTON AND GALILEO,"short time during which it was visible, in consequence of clouds having"
3467,MILTON AND GALILEO,"obscured the face of the luminary, prevented him from being able to"
3468,MILTON AND GALILEO,"determine the accuracy of his surmise, but since then it has been"
3469,MILTON AND GALILEO,"ascertained that no transit of Mercury took place at that time, and"
3470,MILTON AND GALILEO,Kepler afterwards acknowledged that he had arrived at an erroneous
3471,MILTON AND GALILEO,conclusion. Galileo was much puzzled in trying to find out the true
3472,MILTON AND GALILEO,nature of the spots. At first he was led to imagine that planets like
3473,MILTON AND GALILEO,Mercury and Venus revolved round the Sun at a short distance from the
3474,MILTON AND GALILEO,"orb, and that their dark bodies, travelling across the solar disc, gave"
3475,MILTON AND GALILEO,"rise to the phenomenon of the spots. After further observation, he"
3476,MILTON AND GALILEO,ascertained that the spots were in actual contact with the Sun; that
3477,MILTON AND GALILEO,"they were irregular in shape and size, and continued to appear and"
3478,MILTON AND GALILEO,disappear. Sometimes a large spot would break up into several smaller
3479,MILTON AND GALILEO,"ones, and at other times three or four small spots would unite to form a"
3480,MILTON AND GALILEO,"large one. They all had a common motion, and appeared to rotate with"
3481,MILTON AND GALILEO,"the Sun, from which Galileo concluded that the orb rotated on his axis"
3482,MILTON AND GALILEO,in about twenty-eight days. Galileo believed that the spots were clouds
3483,MILTON AND GALILEO,"floating in the solar atmosphere, and that they intercepted a portion of"
3484,MILTON AND GALILEO,the light of the Sun.
3485,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3486,MILTON AND GALILEO,"The Milky Way, that wondrous zone of light which encircles the heavens,"
3487,MILTON AND GALILEO,remained for many ages a source of perplexity to ancient astronomers and
3488,MILTON AND GALILEO,"philosophers, who, in their endeavours to ascertain its nature, had"
3489,MILTON AND GALILEO,arrived at various absurd and erroneous conclusions. On directing his
3490,MILTON AND GALILEO,"telescope to this luminous tract, Galileo discovered, to his"
3491,MILTON AND GALILEO,"inexpressible admiration, that it consists of a vast multitude of stars,"
3492,MILTON AND GALILEO,too minute to be visible to the naked eye. He also discerned that its
3493,MILTON AND GALILEO,"milky luminosity is created by the blended light of myriads of stars, so"
3494,MILTON AND GALILEO,remote as to be incapable of definition by his telescope. In his
3495,MILTON AND GALILEO,'Nuncius Sidereus' he gives an account of his observations of the Galaxy
3496,MILTON AND GALILEO,and expresses his satisfaction that he has been enabled to terminate an
3497,MILTON AND GALILEO,ancient controversy by demonstrating to the senses the stellar structure
3498,MILTON AND GALILEO,of the Milky Way. When engaged in exploring the celestial regions with
3499,MILTON AND GALILEO,"his telescope, Galileo observed a marked difference in the appearance of"
3500,MILTON AND GALILEO,"the fixed stars, as compared with that of the planets. Each of the"
3501,MILTON AND GALILEO,"latter showed a rounded disc resembling that of a small moon, but the"
3502,MILTON AND GALILEO,"stars exhibited no disc, and shone as vivid sparkling points of light;"
3503,MILTON AND GALILEO,"all of them, whether of large or small magnitude, presenting the same"
3504,MILTON AND GALILEO,appearance in the telescope. This led him to conclude that the fixed
3505,MILTON AND GALILEO,"stars were not illumined by the Sun, because their brilliancy in all"
3506,MILTON AND GALILEO,"their changes of position remained unaltered. But, in the case of the"
3507,MILTON AND GALILEO,"planets, he found that their lustre varied according to their distance"
3508,MILTON AND GALILEO,"from the Sun; consequently, he believed they were opaque bodies which"
3509,MILTON AND GALILEO,"reflected the solar rays. On directing his telescope to the Pleiades,"
3510,MILTON AND GALILEO,"which, to the naked eye, appear as a group of seven stars, he succeeded"
3511,MILTON AND GALILEO,"in counting forty lucid points. The nebula Praesepe in Cancer, he was"
3512,MILTON AND GALILEO,also able to resolve into a cluster of stars. Galileo made many other
3513,MILTON AND GALILEO,"observations of the heavenly bodies with his telescope, all of which he"
3514,MILTON AND GALILEO,describes as having afforded him 'incredible delight.'
3515,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3516,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Shortly before the failure of his eyesight, Galileo discovered the"
3517,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Moon's diurnal libration, a variation in the visible edges of the Moon"
3518,MILTON AND GALILEO,"caused by its oscillatory motion, and the diurnal rotation of the Earth"
3519,MILTON AND GALILEO,on her axis.
3520,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3521,MILTON AND GALILEO,Though Milton has not favoured us with any interesting details of his
3522,MILTON AND GALILEO,"interview with Galileo, nor expressed his opinions with regard to the"
3523,MILTON AND GALILEO,controversies which at that time agitated both the religious and
3524,MILTON AND GALILEO,"scientific worlds of thought, and which eventually culminated in a storm"
3525,MILTON AND GALILEO,of rancour and hatred that burst over the devoted head of the aged
3526,MILTON AND GALILEO,"astronomer, and brought him to his knees, yet he informs us that he"
3527,MILTON AND GALILEO,"'found and visited' Galileo, whom he describes as 'grown old,' and"
3528,MILTON AND GALILEO,cynically remarks that he 'was held a prisoner of the Inquisition for
3529,MILTON AND GALILEO,thinking in astronomy otherwise than the Franciscan and Dominican
3530,MILTON AND GALILEO,"licensers thought.' Milton does not allude to his blindness, and yet it"
3531,MILTON AND GALILEO,"would be natural to imagine that, had his host suffered from this"
3532,MILTON AND GALILEO,"affliction at the time of his visit, he would have referred to it. We"
3533,MILTON AND GALILEO,"learn that Milton arrived in Italy in the spring of 1638. In 1637, the"
3534,MILTON AND GALILEO,"affection which, in the preceding year, deprived Galileo of the use of"
3535,MILTON AND GALILEO,"his right eye, attacked the left also, which began to grow dim, and in"
3536,MILTON AND GALILEO,"the course of a few months became sightless; so that, although Milton"
3537,MILTON AND GALILEO,"has not alluded to this calamity, Galileo had become totally blind at"
3538,MILTON AND GALILEO,the time of his visit.
3539,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3540,MILTON AND GALILEO,How much Milton was impressed with the fame of Galileo and his telescope
3541,MILTON AND GALILEO,becomes apparent on referring to his 'Paradise Lost.' In it he alludes
3542,MILTON AND GALILEO,"to the instrument upon three different occasions, twice when in the"
3543,MILTON AND GALILEO,hands of Galileo; and the remembrance of the same artist was doubtless
3544,MILTON AND GALILEO,in his mind when he mentions the 'glazed optic tube' in another part of
3545,MILTON AND GALILEO,his poem. The interval that elapsed from the date of Milton's visit to
3546,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Galileo in 1638, to the publication of 'Paradise Lost' in 1667, included"
3547,MILTON AND GALILEO,"a period of about thirty years, yet this length of time did not erase"
3548,MILTON AND GALILEO,from Milton's memory his recollection of Galileo and of his pleasant
3549,MILTON AND GALILEO,sojourn at Florence.
3550,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3551,MILTON AND GALILEO,The first allusion in the poem to the Italian astronomer is in the lines
3552,MILTON AND GALILEO,in which Milton describes the shield carried by Satan:--
3553,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3554,MILTON AND GALILEO,The broad circumference
3555,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose orb"
3556,MILTON AND GALILEO,Through optic glass the Tuscan artist views
3557,MILTON AND GALILEO,"At evening, from the top of Fesolé,"
3558,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Or in Valdarno, to descry new lands,"
3559,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Rivers, or mountains, in her spotty globe.--i. 286-91."
3560,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3561,MILTON AND GALILEO,Galileo is described as having observed the Moon from the heights of
3562,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Fesolé, which formed part of the suburbs of Florence, or from Valdarno,"
3563,MILTON AND GALILEO,"the valley of the Arno, in which the city is situated. The belief that"
3564,MILTON AND GALILEO,Galileo had discovered continents and seas on the Moon justified Milton
3565,MILTON AND GALILEO,in imagining the existence of rivers and mountains on the lunar surface.
3566,MILTON AND GALILEO,The expression 'spotty globe' is more descriptive of the appearance of
3567,MILTON AND GALILEO,"our satellite when observed with the telescope, than when seen with the"
3568,MILTON AND GALILEO,naked eye. Galileo's attention was attracted by the freckled aspect of
3569,MILTON AND GALILEO,the Moon--a visual effect created by the number of extinct volcanoes
3570,MILTON AND GALILEO,scattered over the surface of the orb.
3571,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3572,MILTON AND GALILEO,In his next allusion to the telescope Milton associates Galileo's name
3573,MILTON AND GALILEO,with the instrument:--
3574,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3575,MILTON AND GALILEO,As when by night the glass
3576,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Of Galileo, less assured, observes"
3577,MILTON AND GALILEO,Imagined lands and regions in the Moon.--v. 261-63.
3578,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3579,MILTON AND GALILEO,In these lines Milton describes with accuracy the extent of Galileo's
3580,MILTON AND GALILEO,knowledge of our satellite. The conclusions which the Italian astronomer
3581,MILTON AND GALILEO,arrived at with regard to its habitability were not supported by
3582,MILTON AND GALILEO,telescopic evidence sufficient to justify such a belief. Galileo writes:
3583,MILTON AND GALILEO,"'Had its surface been absolutely smooth it would have been but a vast,"
3584,MILTON AND GALILEO,"unblessed desert, void of animals, of plants, of cities and men; the"
3585,MILTON AND GALILEO,"abode of silence and inaction--senseless, lifeless, soulless, and"
3586,MILTON AND GALILEO,stripped of all those ornaments which now render it so variable and so
3587,MILTON AND GALILEO,beautiful:'--
3588,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3589,MILTON AND GALILEO,"There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps"
3590,MILTON AND GALILEO,Astronomer in the Sun's lucent orb
3591,MILTON AND GALILEO,Through his glazed optic tube yet never saw.--iii. 588-90.
3592,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3593,MILTON AND GALILEO,Milton may have remembered that Galileo was the first astronomer who
3594,MILTON AND GALILEO,directed a telescope to the Sun; and that he discovered the dark spots
3595,MILTON AND GALILEO,frequently seen on the solar disc.
3596,MILTON AND GALILEO,
3597,MILTON AND GALILEO,"Anyone who has read a history of the life of Galileo, and contemplated"
3598,MILTON AND GALILEO,"the career of this remarkable man, his ardent struggles in the cause of"
3599,MILTON AND GALILEO,"freedom and philosophic truth, his victories and reverses, his brilliant"
3600,MILTON AND GALILEO,"astronomical discoveries, and his investigation of the laws of motion,"
3601,MILTON AND GALILEO,"and other natural phenomena, will arrive at the conclusion that he"
3602,MILTON AND GALILEO,"merited the distinction conferred upon him by our great English poet,"
3603,MILTON AND GALILEO,when he included him among the renowned few whose names are found in the
3604,MILTON AND GALILEO,pages of 'Paradise Lost.'

3613,THE SEASONS,
3614,THE SEASONS,The great path of the Sun among the constellations as seen from the
3615,THE SEASONS,"Earth is called the Ecliptic. It is divided into 360°, and again into"
3616,THE SEASONS,"twelve equal parts of 30°, called Signs. As one half of the ecliptic is"
3617,THE SEASONS,"north, and the other half south, of the equator, the line of"
3618,THE SEASONS,intersection of their planes is at two points which are known as the
3619,THE SEASONS,"equinoctial points, because, when the Sun on his upward and downward"
3620,THE SEASONS,journey arrives at either of them the days and nights are of equal
3621,THE SEASONS,"length all over the world. The equinoctial points are not stationary,"
3622,THE SEASONS,but have a westerly motion of 50´´ annually along the ecliptic; at this
3623,THE SEASONS,"rate they will require a period of 25,868 years to complete an entire"
3624,THE SEASONS,circuit of the heavens.
3625,THE SEASONS,
3626,THE SEASONS,Milton alludes to the ecliptic when he mentions the arrival of Satan
3627,THE SEASONS,upon the Earth:--
3628,THE SEASONS,
3629,THE SEASONS,"Down from the ecliptic, sped with hoped success,"
3630,THE SEASONS,"Throws his steep flight in many an airy wheel,"
3631,THE SEASONS,Nor staid till on Niphates top he lights.--iii. 740-42.
3632,THE SEASONS,
3633,THE SEASONS,Extending for 9° on each side of the ecliptic is a zone or belt called
3634,THE SEASONS,"the Zodiac, the mesial line of which is occupied by the Sun, and within"
3635,THE SEASONS,this space the principal planets perform their annual revolutions. It
3636,THE SEASONS,was for long believed that the paths of all the planets lay within the
3637,THE SEASONS,"zodiac, but on the discovery of the minor planets, Ceres, Pallas, and"
3638,THE SEASONS,"Juno, it was ascertained that they travelled beyond this zone. The stars"
3639,THE SEASONS,situated within the zodiac are divided into twelve groups or
3640,THE SEASONS,"constellations, which correspond with the twelve signs, and each is"
3641,THE SEASONS,named after an animal or some figure which it is supposed to resemble.
3642,THE SEASONS,The zodiac is of great antiquity; the ancient Egyptians and Hindoos made
3643,THE SEASONS,"use of it, and there are allusions to it in the earliest astronomical"
3644,THE SEASONS,records. The twelve constellations of the zodiac bear the following
3645,THE SEASONS,names:--
3646,THE SEASONS,
3647,THE SEASONS,Aries the Ram
3648,THE SEASONS,Taurus the Bull
3649,THE SEASONS,Gemini the Twins
3650,THE SEASONS,Cancer the Crab
3651,THE SEASONS,Leo the Lion
3652,THE SEASONS,Virgo the Virgin
3653,THE SEASONS,Libra the Balance
3654,THE SEASONS,Scorpio the Scorpion
3655,THE SEASONS,Sagittarius the Archer
3656,THE SEASONS,Capricornus the Goat
3657,THE SEASONS,Aquarius the Water-bearer
3658,THE SEASONS,Pisces the Fishes
3659,THE SEASONS,
3660,THE SEASONS,"In close association with the Sun's annual journey are the seasons, upon"
3661,THE SEASONS,the regular sequence of which mankind depend for the various products of
3662,THE SEASONS,the soil essential for the maintenance and enjoyment of life. The
3663,THE SEASONS,"revolution of the Earth in her orbit, and the inclination of her axis to"
3664,THE SEASONS,"her annual path, causing the plane of the equator to be inclined 23-1/2°"
3665,THE SEASONS,"to that of the ecliptic, are the reasons which account for the"
3666,THE SEASONS,"succession of the seasons--Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. Owing to"
3667,THE SEASONS,"the position of the Earth's axis with regard to her orbit, the Sun"
3668,THE SEASONS,"appears to travel 23-1/2° north and 23-1/2° south of the equator. When,"
3669,THE SEASONS,"on June 21, the orb attains his highest northern altitude, we have the"
3670,THE SEASONS,"summer solstice and the longest days; when, by retracing his steps, he"
3671,THE SEASONS,"declines 23-1/2° below the equator, at which point he arrives on"
3672,THE SEASONS,"December 21, we have the winter solstice and the shortest days."
3673,THE SEASONS,Intermediate between those two seasons are spring and autumn. When the
3674,THE SEASONS,"Sun, on his journey northward, reaches the equator, we have the vernal"
3675,THE SEASONS,"equinox, and at this period of the year the days and nights are of equal"
3676,THE SEASONS,"length all over the globe. In a similar manner, when, on his return"
3677,THE SEASONS,"journey, the Sun is again on the equator, the autumnal equinox occurs."
3678,THE SEASONS,"In summer the North Pole is inclined towards the Sun, consequently his"
3679,THE SEASONS,rays fall more direct and impart much more heat to the northern
3680,THE SEASONS,"hemisphere than in winter, when the Pole is turned away from the Sun."
3681,THE SEASONS,This difference in the incidence of the solar rays upon the surface of
3682,THE SEASONS,"the globe, along with the increased length of the day, mainly accounts"
3683,THE SEASONS,for the high temperature of summer as compared with that of winter.
3684,THE SEASONS,
3685,THE SEASONS,"Astronomically, the seasons commence at the periods of the equinoxes and"
3686,THE SEASONS,"solstices. Spring begins on March 21, the time of the vernal equinox;"
3687,THE SEASONS,"summer on June 21, at the summer solstice; autumn on September 22, at"
3688,THE SEASONS,"the autumnal equinox; and winter on December 21, at the winter solstice."
3689,THE SEASONS,This conventional division of the year is not equally applicable to all
3690,THE SEASONS,parts of the globe. In the arctic and antarctic regions spring and
3691,THE SEASONS,"autumn are very brief, the summer is short and the winter of long"
3692,THE SEASONS,"duration. In the tropics, owing to the comparatively slight difference"
3693,THE SEASONS,"in the obliquity of the Sun's rays, one season is, as regards"
3694,THE SEASONS,"temperature, not much different from the other; but in the temperate"
3695,THE SEASONS,regions of the Earth the vicissitudes of the seasons are more
3696,THE SEASONS,"perceptible and can be best distinguished by the growth of vegetation,"
3697,THE SEASONS,and the changes observable in the foliage of shrubs and trees. In spring
3698,THE SEASONS,"there is the budding, in summer the blossom, in autumn the"
3699,THE SEASONS,"fruit-bearing, and in winter the leafless condition of deciduous trees,"
3700,THE SEASONS,and the repose of vegetable life.
3701,THE SEASONS,
3702,THE SEASONS,The legendary belief that before the Fall there reigned on the Earth a
3703,THE SEASONS,"perpetual spring, is introduced by Milton in his poem when he describes"
3704,THE SEASONS,the pleasant surroundings associated with the happy conditions of life
3705,THE SEASONS,that existed in Paradise:--
3706,THE SEASONS,
3707,THE SEASONS,"Thus was this place,"
3708,THE SEASONS,A happy rural seat of various view:
3709,THE SEASONS,Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm;
3710,THE SEASONS,"Others whose fruit, burnished with golden rind,"
3711,THE SEASONS,"Hung amiable--Hesperian fables true,"
3712,THE SEASONS,If true here only--and of delicious taste.
3713,THE SEASONS,"Betwixt them lawns, or level downs, and flocks"
3714,THE SEASONS,"Grazing the tender herb, were interposed,"
3715,THE SEASONS,Or palmy hillock; or the flowery lap
3716,THE SEASONS,"Of some irriguous valley spread her store,"
3717,THE SEASONS,"Flowers of all hue, and without thorn the rose."
3718,THE SEASONS,"Another side, umbrageous grots and caves"
3719,THE SEASONS,"Of cool recess, o'er which the mantling vine"
3720,THE SEASONS,"Lays forth her purple grape, and gently creeps"
3721,THE SEASONS,Luxuriant; meanwhile murmuring waters fall
3722,THE SEASONS,"Down the slope hill dispersed, or in a lake"
3723,THE SEASONS,That to the fringèd bank with myrtle crowned
3724,THE SEASONS,"Her crystal mirror holds, unite their streams."
3725,THE SEASONS,"The birds their quire apply; airs, vernal airs,"
3726,THE SEASONS,"Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune"
3727,THE SEASONS,"The trembling leaves, while universal Pan,"
3728,THE SEASONS,"Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance,"
3729,THE SEASONS,Led on the eternal Spring.--iv. 246-68.
3730,THE SEASONS,
3731,THE SEASONS,"In sad contrast with this charming sylvan scene, we turn to the unhappy"
3732,THE SEASONS,consequences which ensued as a result of the first act of transgression.
3733,THE SEASONS,Milton describes a change of climate characterised by extremes of heat
3734,THE SEASONS,and cold which succeeded the perpetual spring. The Sun was made to shine
3735,THE SEASONS,so that the Earth should be exposed to torrid heat and icy cold
3736,THE SEASONS,unpleasant to endure. The pale Moon and the planets were given power to
3737,THE SEASONS,"combine with noxious effect, and the fixed stars to shed their malignant"
3738,THE SEASONS,influences:--
3739,THE SEASONS,
3740,THE SEASONS,The Sun
3741,THE SEASONS,"Had first his precept so to move, so shine,"
3742,THE SEASONS,As might affect the Earth with cold and heat
3743,THE SEASONS,"Scarce tolerable, and from the north to call"
3744,THE SEASONS,"Decrepit winter, from the south to bring"
3745,THE SEASONS,Solstitial summer's heat. To the blanc Moon
3746,THE SEASONS,Her office they prescribed; to the other five
3747,THE SEASONS,"Their planetary motions and aspects,"
3748,THE SEASONS,"In sextile, square, and trine, and opposite,"
3749,THE SEASONS,"Of noxious efficacy, and when to join"
3750,THE SEASONS,In synod unbenign; and taught the fixed
3751,THE SEASONS,Their influence malignant when to shower--
3752,THE SEASONS,"Which of them rising with the Sun or falling,"
3753,THE SEASONS,Should prove tempestuous. To the winds they set
3754,THE SEASONS,"Their corners, when with bluster to confound"
3755,THE SEASONS,"Sea, air, and shore; the thunder when to roll"
3756,THE SEASONS,With terror through the dark aerial hall.--x. 651-67.
3757,THE SEASONS,
3758,THE SEASONS,We are here afforded an opportunity of learning that Milton possessed
3759,THE SEASONS,"some knowledge of astrology, to which he makes allusion in other parts"
3760,THE SEASONS,"of his poem besides. In his time, astrology was believed in by many"
3761,THE SEASONS,"persons, and there were few learned men but who knew something of that"
3762,THE SEASONS,occult science. Milton may be included among those who devoted some
3763,THE SEASONS,"attention to astrology. Of this there is ample evidence, by the manner"
3764,THE SEASONS,in which he expresses himself in words and phrases in common use among
3765,THE SEASONS,astrologers.
3766,THE SEASONS,
3767,THE SEASONS,"The professors of this art recognised five planetary aspects, viz.,"
3768,THE SEASONS,"opposition, conjunction, sextile, square, and trine, each possessing its"
3769,THE SEASONS,"peculiar kind of influence on events. The Moon, the planets, and the"
3770,THE SEASONS,"constellations in their conjunctions and configurations, were believed"
3771,THE SEASONS,to reveal to those who could understand the significance of their
3772,THE SEASONS,"aspects, the destiny of individuals and the occurrence of future events."
3773,THE SEASONS,The inauspicious influences of the heavenly bodies are described by
3774,THE SEASONS,Milton as contributing to the general disarrangement of the happy
3775,THE SEASONS,condition of things that existed before the Fall.
3776,THE SEASONS,
3777,THE SEASONS,After having described the adverse physical changes which occurred in
3778,THE SEASONS,"Nature as a consequence of the Fall, Milton makes use of his"
3779,THE SEASONS,"astronomical knowledge in explaining how they were brought about, and"
3780,THE SEASONS,suggests two hypotheses: (1) a change of position of the Earth's axis;
3781,THE SEASONS,(2) an alteration of the Sun's path from the equinoctial road:--
3782,THE SEASONS,
3783,THE SEASONS,Some say he bid his Angels turn askance
3784,THE SEASONS,The poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more
3785,THE SEASONS,From the Sun's axle; they with labour pushed
3786,THE SEASONS,Oblique the centric globe: some say the Sun
3787,THE SEASONS,Was bid turn reins from the equinoctial road
3788,THE SEASONS,Like distant breadth--to Taurus with the seven
3789,THE SEASONS,"Atlantic Sisters, and the Spartan Twins,"
3790,THE SEASONS,Up to the Tropic Crab; thence down amain
3791,THE SEASONS,"By Leo, and the Virgin, and the Scales,"
3792,THE SEASONS,As deep as Capricorn; to bring in change
3793,THE SEASONS,Of seasons to each clime. Else had the spring
3794,THE SEASONS,Perpetual smiled on Earth with vernant flowers.--x. 668-79.
3795,THE SEASONS,
3796,THE SEASONS,"In support of the theory of a perpetual spring, Milton assumes that the"
3797,THE SEASONS,"Earth's axis was directed at right angles to her orbit, and that the"
3798,THE SEASONS,"plane of the equator coincided with that of the ecliptic. Consequently,"
3799,THE SEASONS,"the Sun's path remained always on the equator, where his rays were"
3800,THE SEASONS,"vertical, and north and south of this line each locality on the Earth"
3801,THE SEASONS,"enjoyed one constant season, the character of which depended upon its"
3802,THE SEASONS,geographical position. In what are now the temperate regions of the
3803,THE SEASONS,"globe there was one continuous season, similar in climate and length of"
3804,THE SEASONS,"day to what is experienced at the vernal equinox, when the Sun is for a"
3805,THE SEASONS,"few days on the equator. There was then no winter, no summer, nor"
3806,THE SEASONS,"autumn; and, consequently, the growth of vegetation must have taken"
3807,THE SEASONS,place under conditions of climate entirely different to what exist on
3808,THE SEASONS,the Earth at the present time.
3809,THE SEASONS,
3810,THE SEASONS,"The change of position of the Earth's axis, 'twice ten degrees and more"
3811,THE SEASONS,"from the Sun's axle,' is described by Milton as having been"
3812,THE SEASONS,"accomplished by the might of angels, who 'with labour pushed oblique the"
3813,THE SEASONS,centric globe.'
3814,THE SEASONS,
3815,THE SEASONS,"(2) According to the Ptolemaic belief, the Sun revolved round the Earth,"
3816,THE SEASONS,but his course was altered from the equinoctial road to the path that he
3817,THE SEASONS,"now pursues, which is the ecliptic. Instead of remaining on the equator,"
3818,THE SEASONS,he travels an equal distance from this line upwards and downwards in
3819,THE SEASONS,each hemisphere.
3820,THE SEASONS,
3821,THE SEASONS,The path of the Sun in the heavens is described by Milton with marked
3822,THE SEASONS,"precision, and he mentions in regular order the names of the zodiacal"
3823,THE SEASONS,constellations through which the orb travels. Passing through Taurus
3824,THE SEASONS,with the seven Atlantic Sisters (the Pleiades) and the Spartan Twins
3825,THE SEASONS,"(Gemini), he enters the Tropic Crab (Cancer), in which constellation he"
3826,THE SEASONS,attains his highest northern altitude; thence downwards he travels
3827,THE SEASONS,"through Leo, Virgo, and the Scales (Libra), as deep as Capricornus,"
3828,THE SEASONS,reaching his lowest point of declination at the winter solstice; and
3829,THE SEASONS,"were it not for this alteration of the Sun's path, the poet informs us"
3830,THE SEASONS,that perpetual spring would have reigned upon the Earth.
3831,THE SEASONS,
3832,THE SEASONS,Milton was evidently well acquainted with the astronomical reasons (the
3833,THE SEASONS,revolution of the Earth in her orbit and the obliquity of the ecliptic)
3834,THE SEASONS,by which the occurrence and regular sequence of the seasons can be
3835,THE SEASONS,explained.
3836,THE SEASONS,
3837,THE SEASONS,The path of the Sun in the heavens; his upward and downward course from
3838,THE SEASONS,the equator; the names of the constellations through which the orb
3839,THE SEASONS,"travels, and the periods of the year at which he enters them, were also"
3840,THE SEASONS,familiar to him.
3841,THE SEASONS,
3842,THE SEASONS,"The grateful change of the seasons, and the varied aspects of nature"
3843,THE SEASONS,"peculiar to each, which give a charm and freshness to the rolling year,"
3844,THE SEASONS,"must have been to Milton a source of pleasure and delight, and have"
3845,THE SEASONS,stimulated his poetic fancy.
3846,THE SEASONS,
3847,THE SEASONS,"His observation of natural phenomena, and his keen perception of the"
3848,THE SEASONS,"pleasing changes which accompany them, are described in the following"
3849,THE SEASONS,lines:--
3850,THE SEASONS,
3851,THE SEASONS,"As, when from mountain-tops the dusky clouds"
3852,THE SEASONS,"Ascending, while the north wind sleeps, o'erspread"
3853,THE SEASONS,"Heaven's cheerful face, the louring element"
3854,THE SEASONS,"Scowls o'er the darkened landskip snow or shower,"
3855,THE SEASONS,"If chance the radiant Sun, with farewell sweet,"
3856,THE SEASONS,"Extend his evening beam, the fields revive,"
3857,THE SEASONS,"The birds their notes renew, and bleating herds"
3858,THE SEASONS,"Attest their joy, that hill and valley rings.--ii. 488-95."
3859,THE SEASONS,
3860,THE SEASONS,The ancient poets Virgil and Ovid describe the Earth as having been
3861,THE SEASONS,"created in the spring; and associated with this season, which"
3862,THE SEASONS,
3863,THE SEASONS,to the heart inspires
3864,THE SEASONS,"Vernal delight and joy--iv. 154-55,"
3865,THE SEASONS,
3866,THE SEASONS,"were the Graces and the Hours, which danced hand in hand as they led on"
3867,THE SEASONS,the eternal Spring.
3868,THE SEASONS,
3869,THE SEASONS,"Milton alludes to the seasons on several occasions throughout his poem,"
3870,THE SEASONS,and to the natural phenomena associated with them:--
3871,THE SEASONS,
3872,THE SEASONS,As bees
3873,THE SEASONS,"In springtime when the Sun with Taurus rides,"
3874,THE SEASONS,Pour forth their populous youth about the hive
3875,THE SEASONS,In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers
3876,THE SEASONS,"Fly to and fro, or on the smoothèd plank"
3877,THE SEASONS,The suburb of their straw-built citadel
3878,THE SEASONS,"New rubbed with balm, expatiate and confer"
3879,THE SEASONS,Their state affairs.--i. 768-75.
3880,THE SEASONS,
3881,THE SEASONS,"The Sun is in the constellation Taurus in April, when the warmth of his"
3882,THE SEASONS,rays begins to impart new life and activity to the insect world after
3883,THE SEASONS,their long winter's sleep.
3884,THE SEASONS,
3885,THE SEASONS,In his description of the repast partaken by the Angel Raphael with Adam
3886,THE SEASONS,"and Eve in Paradise, Milton writes:--"
3887,THE SEASONS,
3888,THE SEASONS,Raised of grassy turf
3889,THE SEASONS,"Their table was, and mossy seats had round,"
3890,THE SEASONS,"And on her ample square, from side to side,"
3891,THE SEASONS,"All Autumn piled, though Spring and Autumn here"
3892,THE SEASONS,Danced hand in hand.--v. 391-95.
3893,THE SEASONS,
3894,THE SEASONS,"In describing Beelzebub when about to address the Stygian Council, he"
3895,THE SEASONS,says:--
3896,THE SEASONS,
3897,THE SEASONS,His look
3898,THE SEASONS,Drew audience and attention still as night
3899,THE SEASONS,"Or summer's noontide air, while thus he spake.--ii. 307-309."
3900,THE SEASONS,
3901,THE SEASONS,The failing vision from which Milton suffered in his declining years was
3902,THE SEASONS,succeeded by total blindness. This sad affliction he alludes to in the
3903,THE SEASONS,following lines:--
3904,THE SEASONS,
3905,THE SEASONS,Thus with the year
3906,THE SEASONS,Seasons return; but not to me returns
3907,THE SEASONS,"Day, or the sweet approach of even or morn,"
3908,THE SEASONS,"Or sight of vernal bloom, or summer's rose.--iii. 40-43."
3909,THE SEASONS,
3910,THE SEASONS,We are able to perceive how much Milton was impressed with the beautiful
3911,THE SEASONS,"seasons, and the varying aspects of the year which accompany them, and"
3912,THE SEASONS,how his poetic imagination luxuriated in the changing variety of nature
3913,THE SEASONS,observable in earth and sky that from day to day afforded him exquisite
3914,THE SEASONS,"delight; and, although his poem was written when blindness had overtaken"
3915,THE SEASONS,"him, yet those glad remembrances remained as fresh in his memory as when"
3916,THE SEASONS,"in his youth he roamed among the flowery meadows, the vocal woodlands,"
3917,THE SEASONS,and the winding lanes of Buckinghamshire.
3918,THE SEASONS,
3919,THE SEASONS,The idea expressed by Milton that the primitive earth enjoyed a
3920,THE SEASONS,"perpetual spring, though pleasing to the imagination, and well adapted"
3921,THE SEASONS,"for poetic description, is not sustained by any astronomical testimony."
3922,THE SEASONS,"Indeed, the position of the Earth, with her axis at right angles to her"
3923,THE SEASONS,"orbit, is one which may be regarded as being ill adapted for the support"
3924,THE SEASONS,"and maintenance of life on her surface, just as her present position is"
3925,THE SEASONS,the best that can be imagined for fulfilling this purpose.
3926,THE SEASONS,
3927,THE SEASONS,Astronomy teaches us to rely with certainty upon the permanence and
3928,THE SEASONS,regular sequence of the seasons. The position of the Earth's axis as she
3929,THE SEASONS,speeds along in her orbit through the unresisting ether remains
3930,THE SEASONS,"unchanged, and her rapid rotation has the effect of increasing its"
3931,THE SEASONS,"stability. Yet, the Earth performs none of her motions with rigid"
3932,THE SEASONS,"precision, and there is a very slow alteration of the position of her"
3933,THE SEASONS,"axis occurring, which, if unchecked, would eventually produce a"
3934,THE SEASONS,coincidence of the equator and the ecliptic. Instead of a succession of
3935,THE SEASONS,"the seasons, there would then be perpetual spring upon the Earth, and,"
3936,THE SEASONS,although it would require a great epoch of time to bring about such a
3937,THE SEASONS,"change, there would result a condition of things entirely different to"
3938,THE SEASONS,"what now exists on the globe. But, before the ecliptic can have"
3939,THE SEASONS,approached sufficiently near the equator to produce any appreciable
3940,THE SEASONS,"effect upon the climate of the Earth, its motion must cease, and after"
3941,THE SEASONS,"remaining stationary for a time, it will begin to recede to its former"
3942,THE SEASONS,position. The seasons must therefore follow each other in regular
3943,THE SEASONS,"sequence, and throughout all time, reminding us of the promise of the"
3944,THE SEASONS,"Creator, 'that while the Earth remaineth seed-time and harvest, and cold"
3945,THE SEASONS,"and heat, and summer and winter shall not cease.'"

3953,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
3954,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
3955,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"The celestial vault, that, like a circling canopy of sapphire hue,"
3956,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"stretches overhead from horizon to horizon, resplendent by night with"
3957,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"myriad stars of different magnitudes and varied brilliancy, forming"
3958,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"clusterings and configurations of fantastic shape and beauty, arrests"
3959,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the attention of the most casual observer. But to one who has studied
3960,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the heavens, and followed the efforts of human genius in unravelling the"
3961,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"mysteries associated with those bright orbs, the impression created on"
3962,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"his mind as he gazes upon them in the still hours of the night, when the"
3963,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"turmoil of life is hushed in repose, is one of wonder and longing to"
3964,THE STARRY HEAVENS,know more of their being and the hidden causes which brought them forth.
3965,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Here, we have poetry written in letters of gold on the sable vestment of"
3966,THE STARRY HEAVENS,night; music in the gliding motion of the spheres; and harmony in the
3967,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"orbital sweep of sun, planet, and satellite."
3968,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
3969,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Milton was not only familiar with 'the face of the sky,' as it is"
3970,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"popularly called, but also knew the structure of the celestial sphere,"
3971,THE STARRY HEAVENS,and the great circles by which it is circumscribed. Two of those--the
3972,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"colures--he alludes to in the following lines, when he describes the"
3973,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"manner in which Satan, to avoid detection, compassed the Earth, after"
3974,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"his discovery by Gabriel in Paradise, and his flight thence:--"
3975,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
3976,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The space of seven continued nights he rode
3977,THE STARRY HEAVENS,With darkness--thrice the equinoctial line
3978,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"He circled, four times crossed the car of night"
3979,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"From pole to pole, traversing each colure.--ix. 63-66."
3980,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
3981,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Aristarchus of Samos believed the stars were golden studs, that"
3982,THE STARRY HEAVENS,illumined the crystal dome of heaven; but modern research has
3983,THE STARRY HEAVENS,transformed this conception of the ancient astronomer's into a universe
3984,THE STARRY HEAVENS,of blazing suns rushing through regions of illimitable space. In
3985,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Milton's time astronomers had arrived at no definite conclusion with
3986,THE STARRY HEAVENS,regard to the nature of the stars. They were known to be self-luminous
3987,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"bodies, situated at a remote distance in space, but it had not been"
3988,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"ascertained with any degree of certainty that they were suns, resembling"
3989,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"in magnitude and brilliancy our Sun. Indeed, little was known of those"
3990,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"orbs until within the past hundred years, when the exploration of the"
3991,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"heavens by the aid of greatly increased telescopic power, was the means"
3992,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"of creating a new branch of astronomical science, called sidereal"
3993,THE STARRY HEAVENS,astronomy.
3994,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
3995,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"We are indebted to Sir William Herschel, more than to any other"
3996,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"astronomer, for our knowledge of the stellar universe. It was he who"
3997,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"ascertained the vastness of its dimensions, and attempted to delineate"
3998,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"its structural configuration. He also explored the star depths, which"
3999,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"occupy the infinitude of space by which we are surrounded, and made"
4000,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"many wonderful discoveries, which testify to his ability as an observer,"
4001,THE STARRY HEAVENS,and to his greatness as an astronomer.
4002,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4003,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"William Herschel was born at Hanover, November 15, 1738. His father was"
4004,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"a musician in the band of the Hanoverian Guard, and trained his son in"
4005,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"his own profession. After four years of military service, young Herschel"
4006,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"arrived in England when nineteen years of age, and maintained himself by"
4007,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"giving lessons in music. We hear of him first at Leeds, where he"
4008,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"followed his profession, and instructed the band of the Durham Militia."
4009,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"From Leeds he went to Halifax, and was appointed organist there; on the"
4010,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"expiration of twelve months he removed to Bath, and was elected to a"
4011,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"similar post at the Octagon Chapel in that city. Here, fortune smiled"
4012,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"upon him, and he became a busy and prosperous man. Besides attending to"
4013,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"his numerous private engagements, he organised concerts, oratorios, and"
4014,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"other public musical entertainments, which gained him much popularity"
4015,THE STARRY HEAVENS,among the cultivated classes which frequented this fashionable resort.
4016,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Notwithstanding his numerous professional engagements, Herschel was able"
4017,THE STARRY HEAVENS,to devote a portion of his time to acquiring knowledge on other
4018,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"subjects. He became proficient in Italian and Greek, studied"
4019,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"mathematics, and read books on astronomy. In 1773 he borrowed a small"
4020,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"telescope, which he used for observational purposes, and was so"
4021,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"captivated with the appearances presented by the celestial bodies, that"
4022,THE STARRY HEAVENS,he resolved to dedicate his life to acquiring 'a knowledge of the
4023,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"construction of the heavens.' This resolution he nobly adhered to, and"
4024,THE STARRY HEAVENS,became one of the most distinguished of astronomers. Like many other
4025,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"astronomers, Herschel possessed the requisite skill which enabled him to"
4026,THE STARRY HEAVENS,construct his own telescopes. Being desirous of possessing a more
4027,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"powerful instrument, and not having the means to purchase one, he"
4028,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"commenced the manufacture of specula, the grinding and polishing of"
4029,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"which had to be done by hand, entailing the necessity of tedious labour"
4030,THE STARRY HEAVENS,and the exercise of much patience. After repeated failures he at length
4031,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"completed a 5-1/2-foot Gregorian reflector, and with this instrument"
4032,THE STARRY HEAVENS,made his first survey of the heavens. Having perceived the desirability
4033,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"of possessing a more powerful telescope, he equipped himself with a"
4034,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"reflector of twenty feet focal length, and it was with this instrument"
4035,THE STARRY HEAVENS,that he made those wonderful discoveries which established his
4036,THE STARRY HEAVENS,reputation as a great astronomer.
4037,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4038,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"On March 31, 1781, when examining the stars in the constellation Gemini,"
4039,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Herschel observed a star which presented an appearance slightly
4040,THE STARRY HEAVENS,different to that of the other stars by which it was surrounded; it
4041,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"looked larger, had a perceptible disc, and its light became fainter when"
4042,THE STARRY HEAVENS,viewed with a higher magnifying power. After having carefully examined
4043,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"this object, Herschel arrived at the conclusion that he had discovered a"
4044,THE STARRY HEAVENS,comet. He communicated intelligence of his discovery to the Royal
4045,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Society, and, a notification of it having been sent to the Continental"
4046,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"observatories, this celestial visitor was subjected to a close scrutiny;"
4047,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"its progressive motion among the stars was carefully observed, and an"
4048,THE STARRY HEAVENS,orbit was assigned to it. After it had been under observation for some
4049,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"time, doubts were expressed as to its being a comet, these were"
4050,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"increased on further examination, and eventually it was discovered that"
4051,THE STARRY HEAVENS,this interesting object was a new planet. This important discovery at
4052,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"once raised Herschel to a position of eminence and distinction, and from"
4053,THE STARRY HEAVENS,a star-gazing musician he became a famous astronomer. A new planet named
4054,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Uranus was added to our system, which completes a revolution round the"
4055,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Sun in a little over eighty-four years, and at a distance of near 1,000"
4056,THE STARRY HEAVENS,millions of miles beyond the orbit of Saturn. Herschel's name became a
4057,THE STARRY HEAVENS,household word. George III. invited him to Court in order that he might
4058,THE STARRY HEAVENS,obtain from his own lips an account of his discovery of the new planet;
4059,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"and so favourable was the impression made by Herschel upon the King,"
4060,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"that he proposed to create him Royal Astronomer at Windsor, and bestow"
4061,THE STARRY HEAVENS,upon him a salary of 200_l._ a year. Herschel decided to accept the
4062,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"proffered appointment, and, with his sister Caroline, removed from Bath"
4063,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"to Datchet, near Windsor, in 1782, and from there to Slough in 1786. In"
4064,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"1788 he married the wealthy widow of a London merchant, by whom he had"
4065,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"one son, who worthily sustained his father's high reputation as an"
4066,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"astronomer. Herschel was created a Knight in 1816, and in 1821 was"
4067,THE STARRY HEAVENS,elected first President of the Royal Astronomical Society. He died at
4068,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Slough on August 25, 1822, when in the eighty-fourth year of his age,"
4069,THE STARRY HEAVENS,and was buried in Upton Churchyard.
4070,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4071,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"It is inscribed on his tomb, that 'he burst the barriers of heaven;' the"
4072,THE STARRY HEAVENS,lofty praise conveyed by this expression is not greater than what
4073,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Herschel merited when we consider with what unwearied assiduity and
4074,THE STARRY HEAVENS,patience he laboured to accomplish the results described in the words
4075,THE STARRY HEAVENS,which have been quoted. By a method called 'star-gauging' he
4076,THE STARRY HEAVENS,accomplished an entire survey of the heavens and examined minutely all
4077,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the stars in their groups and aggregations as they passed before his eye
4078,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"in the field of the telescope. He sounded the depths of the Milky Way,"
4079,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"and explored the wondrous regions of that shining zone, peopled with"
4080,THE STARRY HEAVENS,myriads of suns so closely aggregated in some of its tracts as to
4081,THE STARRY HEAVENS,suggest the appearance of a mosaic of stars. He resolved numerous nebulæ
4082,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"into clusters of stars, and penetrated with his great telescope depth"
4083,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"after depth of space crowded with 'island universes of stars,' beyond"
4084,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"which he was able to discern luminous haze and filmy streaks of light,"
4085,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the evidence of the existence of other universes plunged in depths still
4086,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"more profound, where space verges on infinity. In his exploration of the"
4087,THE STARRY HEAVENS,starry heavens Herschel's labours were truly amazing. On four different
4088,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"occasions he completed a survey of the firmament, and counted the stars"
4089,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"in several thousand gauge-fields; he discovered 2,400 nebulæ, 800"
4090,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"double stars, and attempted to ascertain the approximate distances of"
4091,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the stars by a comparison of their relative brightness.
4092,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4093,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"It had long been surmised, though no actual proof was forthcoming, that"
4094,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the law of gravitation by which the order and stability of our system
4095,THE STARRY HEAVENS,are maintained exercises its potent influence over other material bodies
4096,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"existing in space, and that other systems, though differing in many"
4097,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"respects from that of ours, and presenting a more complex arrangement in"
4098,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"their structure, perform their motions subject to the guidance of this"
4099,THE STARRY HEAVENS,universal law. The uncertainty with regard to the controlling influence
4100,THE STARRY HEAVENS,of gravity was removed by Herschel when he made his important discovery
4101,THE STARRY HEAVENS,of binary star systems. The components of a binary star are usually in
4102,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"such close proximity that, to the naked eye, they appear as one star,"
4103,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"and sometimes, even with telescopic aid, it is impossible to distinguish"
4104,THE STARRY HEAVENS,them individually; but when observed with sufficient magnifying power
4105,THE STARRY HEAVENS,they can be easily perceived as two lucid points. Double stars were for
4106,THE STARRY HEAVENS,a long time believed to be a purely optical phenomenon--an effect
4107,THE STARRY HEAVENS,created by two stars projected on the sphere so as to appear nearly in
4108,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the same line of vision, and, although apparently almost in contact,"
4109,THE STARRY HEAVENS,situated at great distances apart. At one time Herschel entertained a
4110,THE STARRY HEAVENS,similar opinion with regard to those stars. In 1779 he undertook an
4111,THE STARRY HEAVENS,extensive exploration of the heavens with the object of discovering
4112,THE STARRY HEAVENS,double stars. As a result of his labours he presented to the Royal
4113,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Society in 1782 a list of 269 newly discovered double stars, and in"
4114,THE STARRY HEAVENS,three years after he supplemented this list with another which contained
4115,THE STARRY HEAVENS,434 more new stars. He carefully measured the distances by which the
4116,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"component stars were separated, and determined their position angles, in"
4117,THE STARRY HEAVENS,order that he might be able to detect the existence of any sensible
4118,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"parallax. On repeating his observations twenty years after, he"
4119,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"discovered that the relative positions of many of the stars had changed,"
4120,THE STARRY HEAVENS,and in 1802 he made the important announcement of his discovery that the
4121,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"components of many double stars form independent systems, held together"
4122,THE STARRY HEAVENS,in a mutual bond of union and revolving round one common centre of
4123,THE STARRY HEAVENS,gravity.
4124,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4125,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"The importance of this discovery, which we owe to Herschel's sagacity"
4126,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"and accuracy of observation, cannot be over-estimated; what was"
4127,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"previously conjecture and surmise, now became precise knowledge"
4128,THE STARRY HEAVENS,established upon a sure and accurate basis. It was ascertained that the
4129,THE STARRY HEAVENS,law of gravity exerts its power in regulating and controlling the
4130,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"motions of all celestial bodies within the range of telescopic vision,"
4131,THE STARRY HEAVENS,and that the order and harmony which pervade our system are equally
4132,THE STARRY HEAVENS,present among other systems of suns and worlds distributed throughout
4133,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the regions of space. The spectacle of two or more suns revolving round
4134,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"each other, forming systems of greater magnitude and importance than"
4135,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"that of ours, conveyed to the minds of astronomers a knowledge of the"
4136,THE STARRY HEAVENS,mechanism of the heavens which had hitherto been unknown to them.
4137,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4138,THE STARRY HEAVENS,During the many years which Herschel devoted to the exploration of the
4139,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"starry heavens, and when engaged night after night in examining and"
4140,THE STARRY HEAVENS,enumerating the various groups and clusters of stars which passed before
4141,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"his eye in the field of his powerful telescope, he did not fail to"
4142,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"remember the sublime object of his life, and to which he made all his"
4143,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"other investigations subordinate, viz., the delineation of the"
4144,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"structural configuration of the heavens, and the inclusion of all"
4145,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"aggregations, groups, clusters, and galaxies of stars which are"
4146,THE STARRY HEAVENS,apparently scattered promiscuously throughout the regions of space into
4147,THE STARRY HEAVENS,one grand harmonious design of celestial architecture.
4148,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4149,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Having this object in view, he explored the wondrous zone of the Milky"
4150,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Way, gauged its depths, measured its dimensions, and, in attempting to"
4151,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"unravel the intricacies of its structure, penetrated its recesses far"
4152,THE STARRY HEAVENS,beyond the limit attained by any other observer. Acting on the
4153,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"assumption that the stars are uniformly distributed throughout space,"
4154,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Herschel, by his method of star-gauging, concluded that the sidereal"
4155,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"system consists of an irregular stratum of evenly distributed suns,"
4156,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"resembling in form a cloven flat disc, and that the apparent richness of"
4157,THE STARRY HEAVENS,some regions as compared with that of others could be accounted for by
4158,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the position from which it was viewed by an observer. The stars would
4159,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"appear least numerous where the visual line was shortest, and, as it"
4160,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"became lengthened, they would increase in number until, by crowding"
4161,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"behind each other as a greater depth of stratum was penetrated, they"
4162,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"would, when very remote, present the appearance of a luminous cloud or"
4163,THE STARRY HEAVENS,zone of light. After further observation Herschel was compelled to
4164,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"relinquish his theory of equal star distribution, and found, as he"
4165,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"approached the Galaxy, that the stars became much more numerous, and"
4166,THE STARRY HEAVENS,that in the Milky Way itself there was evidence of the gravitation of
4167,THE STARRY HEAVENS,stars towards certain regions forming aggregations and clusters which
4168,THE STARRY HEAVENS,would ultimately lead to its breaking up into numerous separate sidereal
4169,THE STARRY HEAVENS,systems. As he extended his survey of the heavens and examined with
4170,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"greater minuteness the stellar regions in the Galactic tract, he"
4171,THE STARRY HEAVENS,discovered that by his method of star-gauging he was unable to define
4172,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the complexity of structure and variety of arrangement which came under
4173,THE STARRY HEAVENS,his observation; he also perceived that the star-depths are
4174,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"unfathomable, and discerned that beyond the reach of his telescope there"
4175,THE STARRY HEAVENS,existed systems and galaxies of stars situated at an appalling distance
4176,THE STARRY HEAVENS,in the abysmal depths of space. Though the magnitude of that portion of
4177,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the sidereal heavens which came under his observation was inconceivable
4178,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"as regards its dimensions, Herschel was able to perceive that it formed"
4179,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"but a part--and most probably a small part--of the stellar universe, and"
4180,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"that without a more extended knowledge of this universe, which at"
4181,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"present is unattainable, it would be impossible to determine its"
4182,THE STARRY HEAVENS,structural configuration or discover the relationships that exist among
4183,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the sidereal systems and Galactic concourses of stars distributed
4184,THE STARRY HEAVENS,throughout space. Herschel ultimately abandoned his star-gauging method
4185,THE STARRY HEAVENS,of observation and confined his attention to exploring the star depths
4186,THE STARRY HEAVENS,and investigating the laws and theories associated with the bodies
4187,THE STARRY HEAVENS,occupying those distant regions.
4188,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4189,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Since all the planets if viewed from the Sun would be seen to move
4190,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"harmoniously and in regular order round that body, so there may be"
4191,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"somewhere in the universe a central point, or, as some persons imagine,"
4192,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"a great central sun, round which all the systems of stars perform their"
4193,THE STARRY HEAVENS,majestic revolutions with the same beautiful regularity; having their
4194,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"motions controlled by the same law of gravitation, and possessing the"
4195,THE STARRY HEAVENS,same dynamical stability which characterises the mechanism of the solar
4196,THE STARRY HEAVENS,system.
4197,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4198,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The extent of the distance which intervenes between our system and the
4199,THE STARRY HEAVENS,fixed stars constituted a problem which exercised the minds of
4200,THE STARRY HEAVENS,astronomers from an early period until the middle of the present
4201,THE STARRY HEAVENS,century.
4202,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4203,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Tycho Brahé, who repudiated the Copernican theory, asserted as one of"
4204,THE STARRY HEAVENS,his reasons against it that the distances by which the heavenly bodies
4205,THE STARRY HEAVENS,are separated from each other were greater than even the upholders of
4206,THE STARRY HEAVENS,this theory believed them to be. Although the distance of the Sun from
4207,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the Earth was unknown, Tycho was aware that the diameter of the Earth's"
4208,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"orbit must be measured by millions of miles, and yet there was no"
4209,THE STARRY HEAVENS,perceptible motion or change of position of the stars when viewed from
4210,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"any point of the vast circumference which she traverses. Consequently,"
4211,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the Earth, if viewed from the neighbourhood of a star, would also appear"
4212,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"motionless, and the dimensions of her orbit would be reduced to that of"
4213,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"a point. This seemed incredible to Tycho, and he therefore concluded"
4214,THE STARRY HEAVENS,that the Copernican theory was incorrect.
4215,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4216,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The conclusion that the stars are orbs resembling our Sun in magnitude
4217,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"and brilliancy was one which, Tycho urged, should not be hastily"
4218,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"adopted; and yet, if it were conceded that the Earth is a body which"
4219,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"revolves round the Sun, it would be necessary to admit that the stars"
4220,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"are suns also. If the Earth's orbit, as seen from a star, were reduced"
4221,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"to a point, then the Sun, which occupies its centre, would be reduced to"
4222,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"a point of light also, and, when observed from a star of equal"
4223,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"brilliancy and magnitude, would have the same resemblance that the star"
4224,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"has when viewed from the Earth, which may be regarded as being in"
4225,THE STARRY HEAVENS,proximity to the Sun. Tycho Brahé would not admit the accuracy of these
4226,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"conclusions, which were too bewildering and overwhelming for his mental"
4227,THE STARRY HEAVENS,conception.
4228,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4229,THE STARRY HEAVENS,But the investigations of later astronomers disclosed the fact that the
4230,THE STARRY HEAVENS,heavenly bodies are situated at distances more remote from each other
4231,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"than had been previously imagined, and that the reasons which led Tycho"
4232,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"to reject the Copernican theory were based upon erroneous conclusions,"
4233,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"and could, with greater aptitude, be employed in its support. It was"
4234,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"ascertained that the distance of the Sun from the Earth, which at"
4235,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"different periods was surmised to be ten, twenty, and forty millions of"
4236,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"miles, was much greater than had been previously estimated. Later"
4237,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"calculations determined it to be not less than eighty millions of miles,"
4238,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"and, according to the most recent observations, the distance of the Sun"
4239,THE STARRY HEAVENS,from the Earth is believed to be about ninety-three millions of miles.
4240,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4241,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Having once ascertained the distance between the Earth and the Sun,"
4242,THE STARRY HEAVENS,astronomers were enabled to determine with greater facility the
4243,THE STARRY HEAVENS,distances of other heavenly bodies.
4244,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4245,THE STARRY HEAVENS,It was now known that the diameter of the Earth's orbit exceeded 183
4246,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"millions of miles, and yet, with a base line of such enormous length,"
4247,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"and with instruments of the most perfect construction, astronomers were"
4248,THE STARRY HEAVENS,only able to perceive the minutest appreciable alteration in the
4249,THE STARRY HEAVENS,positions of a few stars when observed from opposite points of the
4250,THE STARRY HEAVENS,terrestrial orbit.
4251,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4252,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"It had long been the ambitious desire of astronomers to accomplish, if"
4253,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"possible, a measurement of the abyss which separates our system from the"
4254,THE STARRY HEAVENS,nearest of the fixed stars. No imaginary measuring line had ever been
4255,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"stretched across this region of space, nor had its unfathomed depths"
4256,THE STARRY HEAVENS,ever been sounded by any effort of the human mind. The stars were known
4257,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"to be inconceivably remote, but how far away no person could tell, nor"
4258,THE STARRY HEAVENS,did there exist any guide by which an approximation of their distances
4259,THE STARRY HEAVENS,could be arrived at.
4260,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4261,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"In attempting to calculate the distances of the stars, astronomers have"
4262,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"had recourse to a method called 'Parallax,' by which is meant the"
4263,THE STARRY HEAVENS,apparent change of position of a heavenly body when viewed from two
4264,THE STARRY HEAVENS,different points of observation.
4265,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4266,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The annual parallax of a heavenly body is the angle subtended at that
4267,THE STARRY HEAVENS,body by the radius of the Earth's orbit.
4268,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4269,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"The stars have no diurnal parallax, because, owing to their great"
4270,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"distance, the Earth's radius does not subtend any measurable angle, but"
4271,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the radius of the Earth's orbit, which is immensely larger, does, in the"
4272,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"case of a few stars, subtend a very minute angle."
4273,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4274,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"'This enormous base line of 183 millions of miles is barely sufficient,"
4275,THE STARRY HEAVENS,in conjunction with the use of the most delicate and powerful
4276,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"astronomical instruments, to exhibit the minutest measureable"
4277,THE STARRY HEAVENS,displacement of two or three of the nearest stars.'--Proctor.
4278,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4279,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The efforts of early astronomers to detect any perceptible alteration in
4280,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the positions of the stars when observed from any point of the
4281,THE STARRY HEAVENS,circumference of the Earth's orbit were unsuccessful. Copernicus
4282,THE STARRY HEAVENS,ascribed the absence of any parallax to the immense distances of the
4283,THE STARRY HEAVENS,stars as compared with the dimensions of the terrestrial orbit. Tycho
4284,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Brahé, though possessing better appliances, and instruments of more"
4285,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"perfect construction, was unable to perceive any annual displacement of"
4286,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the stars, and brought this forward as evidence against the Copernican"
4287,THE STARRY HEAVENS,theory.
4288,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4289,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Galileo suggested a method of obtaining the parallax of the fixed stars,"
4290,THE STARRY HEAVENS,by observing two stars of unequal magnitude apparently near to each
4291,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"other, though really far apart. Those, when observed from different"
4292,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"points of the Earth's orbit, would appear to change their positions"
4293,THE STARRY HEAVENS,relatively to each other. The smaller and more distant star would remain
4294,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"unaltered, whilst the larger and nearer star would have changed its"
4295,THE STARRY HEAVENS,position with respect to the other. By continuing to observe the larger
4296,THE STARRY HEAVENS,star during the time that the Earth accomplished a revolution of her
4297,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"orbit, Galileo believed that its parallax might be successfully"
4298,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"determined. Though he did not himself put this method into practice, it"
4299,THE STARRY HEAVENS,has been tried by others with successful results.
4300,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4301,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"In 1669, Hooke made the first attempt to ascertain the parallax of a"
4302,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"fixed star, and selected for this purpose Gamma Draconis, a bright star"
4303,THE STARRY HEAVENS,in the Head of the Dragon. This constellation passed near the zenith of
4304,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"London at the time that he made his observations, and was favourably"
4305,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"situated, so as to avoid the effects of refraction. Hooke made four"
4306,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"observations in the months of July, August, and October, and believed"
4307,THE STARRY HEAVENS,that he determined the parallax of the star; but it was afterwards
4308,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"discovered that he was in error, and that the apparent displacement of"
4309,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the star was mainly due to the aberration of light--a phenomenon which
4310,THE STARRY HEAVENS,was not discovered at that time.
4311,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4312,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"A few years later, Picard, a French astronomer, attempted to find the"
4313,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"parallax of Alpha Lyræ, but was unsuccessful. In 1692-93, Roemer, a"
4314,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Danish astronomer, observed irregularities in the declinations of the"
4315,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"stars which could neither be ascribed to parallax or refraction, and"
4316,THE STARRY HEAVENS,which he imagined resulted from a changing position of the Earth's axis.
4317,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4318,THE STARRY HEAVENS,One of the principal causes which baffled astronomers in their
4319,THE STARRY HEAVENS,endeavours to determine the parallax of the fixed stars was a phenomenon
4320,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"called the 'Aberration of Light,' which was discovered and explained by"
4321,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Bradley in 1727. The peculiar effect of aberration was perceived by him
4322,THE STARRY HEAVENS,when endeavouring to obtain the parallax of Gamma Draconis.
4323,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4324,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Owing to the progressive transmission of light, conjointly with the"
4325,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"motion of the Earth in her orbit, there results an apparent slight"
4326,THE STARRY HEAVENS,displacement of a star from its true position. The extent of the
4327,THE STARRY HEAVENS,displacement depends upon the ratio of the velocity of light as compared
4328,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"with the speed of the Earth in her orbit, which is as 10,000 to 1. As a"
4329,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"consequence of this, each star describes a small ellipse in the course"
4330,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"of a year, the central point of which would indicate the place occupied"
4331,THE STARRY HEAVENS,by the star if the Earth were at rest. The shifting position of the star
4332,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"is very slight, and at the end of a year it returns to its former place."
4333,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4334,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Prior to the discovery of aberration, astronomers ascribed the apparent"
4335,THE STARRY HEAVENS,displacement of the stars arising from this cause as being due to
4336,THE STARRY HEAVENS,parallax--a conclusion which led to erroneous results; but after
4337,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Bradley's discovery this source of error was avoided, and it was found"
4338,THE STARRY HEAVENS,that the parallax of the stars had to be considerably reduced.
4339,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4340,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Bessel was the first astronomer who merited the high distinction of
4341,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"having determined the first reliable stellar parallax, and by this"
4342,THE STARRY HEAVENS,achievement he was enabled to fathom the profound abyss which separates
4343,THE STARRY HEAVENS,our solar system from the stars.
4344,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4345,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Frederick William Bessel was born in 1764 at Minden, in Westphalia. It"
4346,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"was his intention to pursue a mercantile career, and he commenced life"
4347,THE STARRY HEAVENS,by becoming apprenticed to a firm of merchants at Bremen. Soon
4348,THE STARRY HEAVENS,afterwards he accompanied a trading expedition to China and the East
4349,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Indies, and while on this voyage picked up a good deal of information"
4350,THE STARRY HEAVENS,with regard to many matters which came under his observation. He
4351,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"acquired a knowledge of Spanish and English, and made himself acquainted"
4352,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"with the art of navigation. On his return home, Bessel endeavoured to"
4353,THE STARRY HEAVENS,determine the longitude of Bremen. The only appliances which he made use
4354,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"of were a sextant constructed by himself, and a common clock; and yet,"
4355,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"with those rude instruments, he successfully accomplished his object."
4356,THE STARRY HEAVENS,During the next two years he devoted all his spare time to the study of
4357,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"mathematics and astronomy, and, having obtained possession of Harriot's"
4358,THE STARRY HEAVENS,observations of the celebrated comet of 1607--known as Halley's
4359,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"comet--Bessel, after much diligent application and careful calculation,"
4360,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"was enabled to deduce from them an orbit, which he assigned to that"
4361,THE STARRY HEAVENS,remarkable body. This meritorious achievement was the means of procuring
4362,THE STARRY HEAVENS,for him a widely known reputation.
4363,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4364,THE STARRY HEAVENS,A vacancy for an assistant having occurred at Schröter's Observatory at
4365,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Lilienthal, the post was offered to Bessel and accepted by him. Here he"
4366,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"remained for four years, and was afterwards appointed Director of the"
4367,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"new Prussian Observatory at Königsberg, where he pursued his"
4368,THE STARRY HEAVENS,astronomical labours for a period of upwards of thirty years. Bessel
4369,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"directed his energies chiefly to the study of stellar astronomy, and"
4370,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"made many observations in determining the number, the exact positions,"
4371,THE STARRY HEAVENS,and proper motions of the stars. He was remarkable for the precision
4372,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"with which he carried out his observations, and for the accuracy which"
4373,THE STARRY HEAVENS,characterised all his calculations.
4374,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4375,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"In 1837 Bessel, by the exercise of his consummate skill, endeavoured to"
4376,THE STARRY HEAVENS,solve a problem which for many years baffled the efforts of the ablest
4377,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"astronomers, viz., the determination of the parallax of the fixed stars."
4378,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"This had been so frequently attempted, and without success, that the"
4379,THE STARRY HEAVENS,results of any new observations were received with incredulity before
4380,THE STARRY HEAVENS,their value could be ascertained.
4381,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4382,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Bessel was ably assisted by Joseph Frauenhofer, an eminent optician of"
4383,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Munich, who constructed a magnificent heliometer for the Observatory at"
4384,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Königsberg, and in its design introduced a principle which admirably"
4385,THE STARRY HEAVENS,adapted it for micrometrical measurement.
4386,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4387,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"The star selected by Bessel is a binary known as 61 Cygni, the"
4388,THE STARRY HEAVENS,components being of magnitudes 5·5 and 6 respectively. It has a large
4389,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"proper motion, which led him to conclude that its parallax must be"
4390,THE STARRY HEAVENS,considerable.
4391,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4392,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"This star will always be an object of interest to astronomers, as it was"
4393,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the first of the stellar multitude that revealed to Bessel the secret of
4394,THE STARRY HEAVENS,its distance.
4395,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4396,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Bessel commenced his observations in October 1837, and continued them"
4397,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"until March 1840. During this time he made 402 measurements, and, before"
4398,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"arriving at a conclusive result, carefully considered every imaginable"
4399,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"cause of error, and rigorously calculated any inaccuracies that might"
4400,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"arise therefrom. Finally, he determined the parallax of the star to be"
4401,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"0´´·3483--a result equivalent to a distance about 600,000 times that of"
4402,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the Earth from the Sun. In 1842-43 M. Peters, of the Pulkova"
4403,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Observatory, arrived at an almost similar result, having obtained a"
4404,THE STARRY HEAVENS,parallax of 0´´·349; but by more recent observations the parallax of the
4405,THE STARRY HEAVENS,star has been increased to about half a second.
4406,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4407,THE STARRY HEAVENS,About the same time that Bessel was occupied with his observation of 61
4408,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Cygni, Professor Henderson, of Edinburgh, when in charge of the"
4409,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope, directed his attention to Alpha"
4410,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Centauri, one of the brightest stars in the Southern Hemisphere. During"
4411,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"1832-33 he made a series of observations of the star, with the object"
4412,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"of ascertaining its mean declination; and, having been informed"
4413,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"afterwards of its large proper motion, he resolved to make an endeavour"
4414,THE STARRY HEAVENS,to determine its parallax. This he accomplished after his return to
4415,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Scotland, having been appointed Astronomer Royal in that country. By an"
4416,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"examination of the observations made by him at the Cape, he determined"
4417,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the parallax of Alpha Centauri to be 1´´·16, but later astronomers have"
4418,THE STARRY HEAVENS,reduced it to 0´´·75.
4419,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4420,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Professor Henderson's detection of the parallax of Alpha Centauri was
4421,THE STARRY HEAVENS,communicated to the Astronomical Society two months after Bessel
4422,THE STARRY HEAVENS,announced his determination of the parallax of 61 Cygni.
4423,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4424,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The parallax of 61 Cygni assigns to the star a distance of forty
4425,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"billions of miles from the Earth, and that of Alpha Centauri--regarded"
4426,THE STARRY HEAVENS,as the nearest star to our system--a distance of twenty-five billions of
4427,THE STARRY HEAVENS,miles.
4428,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4429,THE STARRY HEAVENS,It is utterly beyond the capacity of the human mind to form any adequate
4430,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"conception of those vast distances, even when measured by the velocity"
4431,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"with which the ether of space is thrilled into light. Light, which"
4432,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"travels twelve millions of miles in a minute, requires 4-1/3 years to"
4433,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"cross the abyss which intervenes between Alpha Centauri and the Earth,"
4434,THE STARRY HEAVENS,and from 61 Cygni the period required for light to reach our globe is
4435,THE STARRY HEAVENS,rather less than double that time.
4436,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4437,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"The parallax of more than a dozen other stars has been determined, and"
4438,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the light passage of a few of the best known is estimated as
4439,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"follows:--Sirius, eight years; Procyon, twelve; Altair, sixteen;"
4440,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Aldebaran, twenty-eight; Capella, thirty; Regulus, thirty-five; Polaris,"
4441,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"sixty-three; and Vega, ninety-six years."
4442,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4443,THE STARRY HEAVENS,It does not always follow that the brightest stars are those situated
4444,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"nearest to our system, though in a general way this may be regarded as"
4445,THE STARRY HEAVENS,correct. The diminishing magnitudes of the stars can be accounted for
4446,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"mainly by their increased distances, rather than by any difference in"
4447,THE STARRY HEAVENS,their intrinsic brilliancy. We should not err by inferring that the most
4448,THE STARRY HEAVENS,minute stars are also the most remote; the telescope revealing thousands
4449,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"that are invisible to the naked eye. There are, however, exceptions to"
4450,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"this general rule, and there are many stars of small magnitude less"
4451,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"remote than those whose names have been enumerated, and whose light"
4452,THE STARRY HEAVENS,passage testifies to their profound distances and surpassing magnitude
4453,THE STARRY HEAVENS,when compared with that of our Sun.
4454,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4455,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Sirius, 'the leader of the heavenly host,' is distant fifty billions of"
4456,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"miles. The orb shines with a brilliancy far surpassing that of the Sun,"
4457,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"and greatly exceeds him in mass and dimensions. Arcturus, the bright"
4458,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"star in Boötes, whose golden yellow light renders it such a conspicuous"
4459,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"object, is so far distant that its measurement gives no reliable"
4460,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"parallax; and if we may infer from what little we know of the stars,"
4461,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Arcturus is believed to be the most magnificent and massive orb entering
4462,THE STARRY HEAVENS,into the structure of that portion of the sidereal system which comes
4463,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"within our cognisance. Judging by its relative size and brightness,"
4464,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"this star is ten thousand times more luminous, and may exceed the Sun"
4465,THE STARRY HEAVENS,one million times in volume.
4466,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4467,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Deneb, in the constellation of the Swan, though a first-magnitude star,"
4468,THE STARRY HEAVENS,possesses no perceptible proper motion or parallax--a circumstance
4469,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"indicative of amazing distance, and magnitude equalling, or surpassing,"
4470,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Arcturus and Sirius.
4471,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4472,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Canopus, in the constellation Argo, in the Southern Hemisphere, the"
4473,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"brightest star in the heavens with the exception of Sirius, possesses no"
4474,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"sensible parallax; consequently, its distance is unknown, though it has"
4475,THE STARRY HEAVENS,been estimated that its light passage cannot be less than sixty-five
4476,THE STARRY HEAVENS,years.
4477,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4478,THE STARRY HEAVENS,By establishing a mean value for the parallax of stars of different
4479,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"magnitudes, it was believed that an approximation of their distances"
4480,THE STARRY HEAVENS,could be obtained by calculating the time occupied in their light
4481,THE STARRY HEAVENS,passage. The light period for stars of the first magnitude has been
4482,THE STARRY HEAVENS,estimated at thirty-six and a half years; this applies to the brightest
4483,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"stars, which are also regarded as the nearest. At the distance indicated"
4484,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"by this period, the Sun would shrink to the dimensions of a"
4485,THE STARRY HEAVENS,seventh-magnitude star and become invisible to the naked eye; this of
4486,THE STARRY HEAVENS,itself affords sufficient proof that the great luminary of our system
4487,THE STARRY HEAVENS,cannot be regarded as one of the leading orbs of the firmament. Stars of
4488,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the second magnitude have a mean distance of fifty-eight light years,"
4489,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"those of the third magnitude ninety-two years, and so on. M. Peters"
4490,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"estimated that light from stars of the sixth magnitude, which are just"
4491,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"visible to the naked eye, requires a period of 138 years to accomplish"
4492,THE STARRY HEAVENS,its journey hither; whilst light emitted from the smallest stars visible
4493,THE STARRY HEAVENS,in large telescopes does not reach the Earth until after the lapse of
4494,THE STARRY HEAVENS,thousands of years from the time of leaving its source.
4495,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4496,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The profound distances of the nearest stars by which we are surrounded
4497,THE STARRY HEAVENS,lead us to consider the isolated position of the solar system in space.
4498,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"A pinnacle of rock, or forsaken raft floating in mid-ocean, is not more"
4499,THE STARRY HEAVENS,distant from the shore than is the Sun from his nearest neighbours. The
4500,THE STARRY HEAVENS,inconceivable dimensions of the abyss by which the orb and his
4501,THE STARRY HEAVENS,attendants are surrounded in utter loneliness may be partially
4502,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"comprehended when it is known that light, which travels from the Sun to"
4503,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the Earth--a distance of ninety-three millions of miles--in eight
4504,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"minutes, requires a period of four and a third years to reach us from"
4505,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the nearest fixed star. A sphere having the Sun at its centre and this
4506,THE STARRY HEAVENS,nearest star at its circumference would have a diameter of upwards of
4507,THE STARRY HEAVENS,fifty billions of miles; the volume of the orb when compared with the
4508,THE STARRY HEAVENS,dimensions of this circular vacuity of space is as a small shot to a
4509,THE STARRY HEAVENS,globe 900 miles in diameter. It has been estimated by Father Secchi
4510,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"that, if a comet when at aphelion were to arrive at a point midway"
4511,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"between the Sun and the nearest fixed star, it would require one hundred"
4512,THE STARRY HEAVENS,million years in the accomplishment of its journey thither. And yet the
4513,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Sun is one of a group of stars which occupy a region of the heavens
4514,THE STARRY HEAVENS,adjacent to the Milky Way and surrounded by that zone; nor is his
4515,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"isolation greater than that of those stars which are his companions, and"
4516,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"who, notwithstanding their profound distance, influence his movements by"
4517,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"their gravitational attraction, and in combination with the other stars"
4518,THE STARRY HEAVENS,of the firmament control his destiny.
4519,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4520,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Ancient astronomers, for the purpose of description, have mapped out the"
4521,THE STARRY HEAVENS,heavens into numerous irregular divisions called 'constellations.' They
4522,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"are of various forms and sizes, according to the configuration of the"
4523,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"stars which occupy them, and have been named after different animals,"
4524,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"mythological heroes, and other objects which they appear to resemble. In"
4525,THE STARRY HEAVENS,a few instances there does exist a similitude to the object after which
4526,THE STARRY HEAVENS,a constellation is called; this is evident in the case of Corona
4527,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Borealis (the Northern Crown), in which there can be seen a conspicuous"
4528,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"arrangement of stars resembling a coronet, and in the constellations of"
4529,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the Dolphin and Scorpion, where the stars are so distributed that the"
4530,THE STARRY HEAVENS,forms of those creatures can be readily recognised. There is some slight
4531,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"resemblance to a bear in Ursa Major, and to a lion in Leo, and no great"
4532,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"effort of the mind is required to imagine a chair in Cassiopeia, and a"
4533,THE STARRY HEAVENS,giant in Orion; but in the majority of instances it is difficult to
4534,THE STARRY HEAVENS,perceive any likeness of the object after which a constellation is
4535,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"named, and in many cases there is no resemblance whatever."
4536,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4537,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The constellations are sixty-seven in number: excluding those of the
4538,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Zodiac, which have been already mentioned, the constellations of the"
4539,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Northern Hemisphere number twenty-nine. The most important of these are
4540,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Ursa Major and Minor, Andromeda, Cassiopeia, Cepheus, Cygnus, Lyra,"
4541,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Aquila, Auriga, Draco, Boötes, Hercules, Pegasus, and Corona Borealis."
4542,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4543,THE STARRY HEAVENS,To an observer of the nocturnal sky the stars appear to be very
4544,THE STARRY HEAVENS,unequally distributed over the celestial sphere. In some regions they
4545,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"are few in number and of small magnitude, whilst in other parts of the"
4546,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"heavens, and especially in the vicinity of the Milky Way, they are"
4547,THE STARRY HEAVENS,present in great numbers and form groups and aggregations of striking
4548,THE STARRY HEAVENS,appearance and conspicuous brilliancy. On taking a casual glance at the
4549,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"midnight sky on a clear moonless night, one is struck with the apparent"
4550,THE STARRY HEAVENS,countless multitude of the stars; yet this impression of their vast
4551,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"number is deceptive, for not more than two thousand stars are usually"
4552,THE STARRY HEAVENS,visible at one time.
4553,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4554,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Much, however, depends upon the keenness of vision of the observer, and"
4555,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the transparency of the atmosphere. Argelander counted at Bonn more than
4556,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"3,000 stars, and Hozeau, near the equator, where all the stars of the"
4557,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"sphere successively appear in view, enumerated 6,000 stars. This number"
4558,THE STARRY HEAVENS,may be regarded as including all the stars in the heavens that are
4559,THE STARRY HEAVENS,visible to the naked eye. With the aid of an opera glass thousands of
4560,THE STARRY HEAVENS,stars can be seen that are imperceptible to ordinary vision.
4561,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Argelander, with a small telescope of 2-1/2 inches aperture, was able to"
4562,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"count 234,000 stars in the Northern Hemisphere. Large telescopes reveal"
4563,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"multitudes of stars utterly beyond the power of enumeration, nor do they"
4564,THE STARRY HEAVENS,appear to diminish in number as depth after depth of space is penetrated
4565,THE STARRY HEAVENS,by powerful instruments. The star-population of the heavens has been
4566,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"reckoned at 100,000,000, but this estimate is merely an assumption;"
4567,THE STARRY HEAVENS,recent discoveries made by means of stellar photography indicate that
4568,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the stars exist in myriads. It is reasonable to believe that there is a
4569,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"limit to the sidereal universe, but it is impossible to assign its"
4570,THE STARRY HEAVENS,bounds or comprehend the apparently infinite extent of its dimensions.
4571,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4572,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Scintillation or twinkling of the stars is a property which
4573,THE STARRY HEAVENS,distinguishes them from the planets. It is due to a disturbed condition
4574,THE STARRY HEAVENS,of the atmosphere and is most apparent when a star is near the horizon;
4575,THE STARRY HEAVENS,at the zenith it almost entirely vanishes. Humboldt states that in the
4576,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"clear air of Cumana, in South America, the stars do not twinkle after"
4577,THE STARRY HEAVENS,they reach an elevation of 15° above the horizon. The presence of
4578,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"moisture in the atmosphere intensifies scintillation, and this is"
4579,THE STARRY HEAVENS,usually regarded as a prognostication of rain. White stars twinkle more
4580,THE STARRY HEAVENS,than red ones. The occurrence of scintillation can be accounted for by
4581,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the fact that the stars are visible as single points of light which
4582,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"twinkle as a whole, but in the case of the Sun, Moon, and planets, they"
4583,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"form discs from which many points of light are emitted; they,"
4584,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"therefore, do not scintillate as a whole, for the absence of rays of"
4585,THE STARRY HEAVENS,light from one portion of their surface is compensated by those from
4586,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"other parts of their discs, giving a mean average which creates a"
4587,THE STARRY HEAVENS,steadiness of vision.
4588,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4589,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"The stars are divided into separate classes called 'magnitudes,' by"
4590,THE STARRY HEAVENS,which their relative apparent size and degree of brightness are
4591,THE STARRY HEAVENS,distinguished. The magnitude of a star does not indicate its mass or
4592,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"dimensions, but its light-giving power, which depends partly upon its"
4593,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"size and distance, though mainly upon the intensity of its luminosity."
4594,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The most conspicuous are termed stars of the first magnitude; there are
4595,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"ten of those in the Northern Hemisphere, and an equal number south of"
4596,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the equator, but they are not all of the same brilliancy. Sirius"
4597,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"outshines every other star of the firmament, and Arcturus has no rival"
4598,THE STARRY HEAVENS,in the northern heavens. The names of the first-magnitude stars north of
4599,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the equator are: Arcturus, Capella, Vega, Betelgeux, Procyon, Aldebaran,"
4600,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Altair, Pollux, Regulus, and Deneb. The next class in order of"
4601,THE STARRY HEAVENS,brightness are called second-magnitude stars; they are fifty or sixty in
4602,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"number, the most important of which is the Pole Star. The stars diminish"
4603,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"in luminosity by successive gradations, and when they sink to the sixth"
4604,THE STARRY HEAVENS,magnitude reach the utmost limit at which they appear visible to the
4605,THE STARRY HEAVENS,naked eye. In great telescopes this classification is carried so low as
4606,THE STARRY HEAVENS,to include stars of the eighteenth and twentieth magnitudes.
4607,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4608,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Entering into the structure of the stellar universe we have Single
4609,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Stars, Double Stars, Triple, Quadruple, and Multiple Stars, Temporary,"
4610,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Periodical, and Variable Stars, Star-groups, Star-clusters, Galaxies,"
4611,THE STARRY HEAVENS,and Nebulæ.
4612,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4613,THE STARRY HEAVENS,SINGLE OR INSULATED STARS include all those orbs sufficiently isolated
4614,THE STARRY HEAVENS,in space so as not to be perceptibly influenced by the attraction of
4615,THE STARRY HEAVENS,other similar bodies. They are believed to constitute the centres of
4616,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"planetary systems, and fulfil the purpose for which they were created by"
4617,THE STARRY HEAVENS,dispensing light and heat to the worlds which circle around them.
4618,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4619,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"The Sun is an example of this class of star, and constitutes the centre"
4620,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"of the system to which the Earth belongs. Reasoning from analogy, it"
4621,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"would be natural to conclude that there are other suns, numberless"
4622,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"beyond conception, the centres of systems of revolving worlds, and"
4623,THE STARRY HEAVENS,although we are utterly unable to catch a glimpse of their planetary
4624,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"attendants, even with the aid of the most powerful telescopes, yet they"
4625,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"have in a few instances been _felt_, and have afforded unmistakable"
4626,THE STARRY HEAVENS,indications of their existence.
4627,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4628,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Since the Sun must be regarded as one of the stellar multitude that
4629,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"people the regions of space, and whose surpassing splendour when"
4630,THE STARRY HEAVENS,contrasted with that of other luminaries can be accounted for by his
4631,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"proximity to us, it would be of interest to ascertain his relative"
4632,THE STARRY HEAVENS,importance when compared with other celestial orbs which may be his
4633,THE STARRY HEAVENS,peers or his superiors in magnitude and brilliancy.
4634,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4635,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The Sun is one of a widely scattered group of stars situated in the
4636,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"plane of the Milky Way and surrounded by that zone, and, as a star among"
4637,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the stars, would be included in the constellation of the Centaur."
4638,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4639,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Although regarded as one of the leading orbs of the firmament, and of"
4640,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"supreme importance to us, astronomers are undecided whether to classify"
4641,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the Sun with stars of greater magnitude and brightness, or assign him a"
4642,THE STARRY HEAVENS,position among minor orbs of smaller size. Much uncertainty exists with
4643,THE STARRY HEAVENS,regard to star magnitudes. This arises from inability on the part of
4644,THE STARRY HEAVENS,astronomers to ascertain the distances of the vast majority of stars
4645,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"visible to the naked eye, and also on account of inequality in their"
4646,THE STARRY HEAVENS,intrinsic brilliancy. Among the stars there exists an indefinite range
4647,THE STARRY HEAVENS,of stellar magnitudes. There are many stars known whose dimensions have
4648,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"been ascertained to greatly exceed those of the Sun, and there are"
4649,THE STARRY HEAVENS,others of much smaller size. No approximation of the magnitude of
4650,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"telescopic stars can be arrived at; many of them may rival Sirius,"
4651,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Canopus, and Arcturus, in size and splendour, their apparent minuteness"
4652,THE STARRY HEAVENS,being a consequence of their extreme remoteness. If the Sun were removed
4653,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"a distance in space equal to that of many of the brightest stars, he"
4654,THE STARRY HEAVENS,would in appearance be reduced to a minute point of light or become
4655,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"altogether invisible; and there are other stars, situated at distances"
4656,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"still more remote, of which sufficient is known to justify us in"
4657,THE STARRY HEAVENS,arriving at the conclusion that the Sun must be ranked among the minor
4658,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"orbs of the firmament, and that many of the stars surpass him in"
4659,THE STARRY HEAVENS,brilliancy and magnitude.
4660,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4661,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"DOUBLE STARS.--To the unaided eye, these appear as single points of"
4662,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"light; but, when observed with a telescope of sufficient magnifying"
4663,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"power, their dual nature can be detected."
4664,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4665,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"The first double star discovered was Mizar, the middle star of the three"
4666,THE STARRY HEAVENS,in Ursa Major which form the tail of the bear. The components are of the
4667,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"fourth and fifth magnitudes, of a brilliant white colour, and distant"
4668,THE STARRY HEAVENS,fourteen seconds of arc.
4669,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4670,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"In 1678, Cassini perceived stars which appeared as single points of"
4671,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"light when viewed with the naked eye, but when observed with the"
4672,THE STARRY HEAVENS,telescope presented the appearance of being double.
4673,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4674,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"The astronomer Bode, in 1781, published a list of eighty double stars,"
4675,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"and, in a few years after, Sir William Herschel discovered several"
4676,THE STARRY HEAVENS,hundreds more of those objects. They are now known to exist in
4677,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"thousands, Mr. Burnham, of the Lick Observatory, having, by his keen"
4678,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"perception of vision, contributed more than any other observer to swell"
4679,THE STARRY HEAVENS,their number.
4680,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4681,THE STARRY HEAVENS,All double stars are not binaries; many of them are known as 'optical
4682,THE STARRY HEAVENS,doubles'--an impression created by two stars when almost in the same
4683,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"line of vision, and, though apparently near, are situated at a great"
4684,THE STARRY HEAVENS,distance apart and devoid of any physical relationship.
4685,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4686,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Binary stars consist of two suns which revolve round their common
4687,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"centre of gravity, and form real dual systems."
4688,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4689,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The close proximity of the components of double stars impressed the
4690,THE STARRY HEAVENS,minds of some astronomers with the belief that a physical bond of union
4691,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"existed between them. In the interval between 1718 and 1759, Bradley"
4692,THE STARRY HEAVENS,detected a change of 30° in the position angle of the two stars forming
4693,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Castor, and was very nearly discovering their physical connection."
4694,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4695,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"In 1767, the Rev. John Michell wrote: 'It is highly probable in"
4696,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"particular, and next to a certainty in general, that such double stars"
4697,THE STARRY HEAVENS,as appear to consist of two or more stars placed very near together do
4698,THE STARRY HEAVENS,really consist of stars placed near together and under the influence of
4699,THE STARRY HEAVENS,some general law.' Afterwards he says: 'It is not improbable that a few
4700,THE STARRY HEAVENS,years may inform us that some of the great number of double and triple
4701,THE STARRY HEAVENS,stars which have been observed by Mr. Herschel are systems of bodies
4702,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"revolving about each other.' Christian Mayer, a German astronomer,"
4703,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"formed a list of stellar pairs, and announced, in 1776, the supposed"
4704,THE STARRY HEAVENS,discovery of 'satellites' to many of the principal stars. His
4705,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"observations were, however, not exact enough to lead to any useful"
4706,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"results, and the existence of his 'planet stars' was at that time"
4707,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"derided, and believed to find a place only in his imagination."
4708,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4709,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The conclusions arrived at by some astronomers with regard to double
4710,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"stars were afterwards confirmed by Herschel, when, by his observation of"
4711,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"a change in the relative positions of many of their components, he was"
4712,THE STARRY HEAVENS,able to announce that they form independent systems in mutual
4713,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"revolution, and are controlled by the law of gravitation."
4714,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4715,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The number of binary stars in active revolution is known to exceed 500;
4716,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"but, besides these, there are doubtless numerous other compound stars"
4717,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"which, on account of their extreme remoteness and the close proximity of"
4718,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"their components, are irresolvable into pairs by any optical appliances"
4719,THE STARRY HEAVENS,which we possess.
4720,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4721,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The revolution of two suns in one sphere presents to our observation a
4722,THE STARRY HEAVENS,scheme of creative design entirely different to the single-star system
4723,THE STARRY HEAVENS,with which we are familiar--one of a higher and more complex order in
4724,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the ascending scale of celestial architecture. For, if we assume that"
4725,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"around each revolving sun there circles a retinue of planetary worlds,"
4726,THE STARRY HEAVENS,it is obvious that a much more complicated arrangement must exist among
4727,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the orbs which enter into the formation of such a system than is found
4728,THE STARRY HEAVENS,among those which gravitate round our Sun.
4729,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4730,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The common centre of gravity of a binary system is situated on a line
4731,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"between both stars, and distant from each in inverse proportion to their"
4732,THE STARRY HEAVENS,respective masses. When the stars are of equal mass their orbits are of
4733,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"equal dimensions, but when the mass of one star exceeds that of the"
4734,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"other, the orbit of the larger star is proportionately diminished as"
4735,THE STARRY HEAVENS,compared with the circumference traversed by the smaller star. When
4736,THE STARRY HEAVENS,their orbits are circular--a rare occurrence--both stars pursue each
4737,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"other in the same path, and invariably occupy it at diametrically"
4738,THE STARRY HEAVENS,opposite points; nor is it possible for one star to approach the other
4739,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"by the minutest interval of space in any duration of time, so long as"
4740,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the synchronous harmony of their revolution remains undisturbed.

4745,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4746,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"When a pair of suns move in an ellipse, their orbits intersect and are"
4747,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"of equal dimensions when the stars are of equal mass, their common"
4748,THE STARRY HEAVENS,centre of gravity being then at a point equidistant from each.
4749,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Consequently, neither star can approach or recede from this point"
4750,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"without the other affecting a similar motion, they must be at periastron"
4751,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"and apastron together, and any acceleration or retardation of speed must"
4752,THE STARRY HEAVENS,occur simultaneously with each. Stars of unequal magnitude always
4753,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"maintain a proportionate distance from their common focus, and both"
4754,THE STARRY HEAVENS,simultaneously occupy corresponding parts of their orbits.
4755,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4756,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"The nature of the motions of those distant suns, and the form of the"
4757,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"orbits which they traverse, have been investigated by several eminent"
4758,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"astronomers, and although the subject is one of much difficulty, on"
4759,THE STARRY HEAVENS,account of their extreme remoteness and the minute angles which have to
4760,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"be dealt with, necessitating the carrying out of very refined"
4761,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"observations, yet a considerable amount of information has been obtained"
4762,THE STARRY HEAVENS,with regard to the paths which they pursue in the accomplishment of
4763,THE STARRY HEAVENS,their revolutions round each other.
4764,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4765,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"The orbits of about sixty stellar pairs have been computed, but only"
4766,THE STARRY HEAVENS,with partial success. Some stars have shown themselves to be totally
4767,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"regardless of theory and computation, and have shot ahead far beyond the"
4768,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"limits ascribed to them, whilst others, by the slowness of their"
4769,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"motions, have upset the calculations of astronomers as much in the"
4770,THE STARRY HEAVENS,opposite direction. So that out of this number the orbits of not more
4771,THE STARRY HEAVENS,than half a dozen are satisfactorily known.
4772,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4773,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The dimensions of stellar orbits are of very varied extent. Some pairs
4774,THE STARRY HEAVENS,are apparently so close that the best optical means which we possess are
4775,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"incapable of dividing them, whilst others revolve in wide and spacious"
4776,THE STARRY HEAVENS,orbits.
4777,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4778,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The most marked peculiarity of the orbits of binary stars is their high
4779,THE STARRY HEAVENS,eccentricity; they are usually much more eccentric than are those of
4780,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the planets, and in some instances approach in form that of a comet."
4781,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4782,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"The finest binary star in the northern heavens is Castor, the brighter"
4783,THE STARRY HEAVENS,of the two leading stars in the constellation Gemini. The components are
4784,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"of the second and third magnitudes, and over five seconds apart. They"
4785,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"are of a brilliant white colour, and form a beautiful object in the"
4786,THE STARRY HEAVENS,telescope.
4787,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4788,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"In 1719 Bradley determined the relative positions of those stars, and on"
4789,THE STARRY HEAVENS,comparing the results obtained by him with recent measurements it was
4790,THE STARRY HEAVENS,found that they had altered to the extent of 125°. Travelling at the
4791,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"same rate of speed, they will require a period of about 420 years to"
4792,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"complete an entire circuit of their orbits. This pace, however, has not"
4793,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"been maintained, for, their periastron having occurred in 1750, they"
4794,THE STARRY HEAVENS,travelled more rapidly in the last century than they are doing at
4795,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"present, and, as their orbits are so eccentric that when at apastron the"
4796,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"stars are twice as remote from each other as at periastron, they will"
4797,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"for the next three and a half centuries continue to slacken their pace,"
4798,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"until they shall have reached the most remote points of their orbits,"
4799,THE STARRY HEAVENS,when they will again begin to approach with an increasing velocity; so
4800,THE STARRY HEAVENS,that the time in which an entire revolution can be accomplished will not
4801,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"be much less than 1,000 years.[8]"
4802,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4803,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"As the distance of Castor is unknown, it is impossible to compute the"
4804,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"combined mass of its components. They are very remote, their light"
4805,THE STARRY HEAVENS,period being estimated at forty-four years. Castor is doubtless a more
4806,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"massive orb than our Sun, and possesses a higher degree of luminosity."
4807,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4808,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Alpha Centauri, in the Southern Hemisphere, is the brightest binary, and"
4809,THE STARRY HEAVENS,also the nearest known star in the heavens; its estimated distance being
4810,THE STARRY HEAVENS,twenty-five billions of miles. Both components equal stars of the first
4811,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"magnitude, and are of a brilliant white colour. Since they were first"
4812,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"observed, in 1709, they have completed two revolutions, and are now"
4813,THE STARRY HEAVENS,accomplishing a third. The eccentricity of their orbit approaches in
4814,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"form that of Faye's comet, which travels round the Sun; consequently the"
4815,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"stars, when at apastron, are twice their periastron distance. Their"
4816,THE STARRY HEAVENS,period of revolution is about eighty-eight years. The mean radius of
4817,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"their orbit corresponds to a span of 1,000 millions of miles, so that"
4818,THE STARRY HEAVENS,those orbs are sometimes as close to each other as Jupiter is to the
4819,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Sun, and never so far distant as Uranus.[9] Their combined mass is twice"
4820,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"that of the Sun, and the luminosity of each star is slightly greater."
4821,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4822,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The double star 61 Cygni--one of the nearest to our system--is believed
4823,THE STARRY HEAVENS,to be a binary the components of which move in an orbit of more spacious
4824,THE STARRY HEAVENS,dimensions than that of any other known revolving pair. Though they have
4825,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"been under continuous observation since 1753, it is only within the last"
4826,THE STARRY HEAVENS,few years that any orbital motion has been perceived. Some observers
4827,THE STARRY HEAVENS,are disinclined to admit the accuracy of this statement; whilst others
4828,THE STARRY HEAVENS,believe that the stars have executed a hyperbolic sweep round their
4829,THE STARRY HEAVENS,common centre of gravity and are now separating.
4830,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4831,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The radius of the orbit in which those bodies travel is sixty-five times
4832,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the distance of the Earth from the Sun; which means that they travel in
4833,THE STARRY HEAVENS,an orbit twice the width of that of the planet Neptune. It has been
4834,THE STARRY HEAVENS,estimated that they complete a revolution in about eight centuries. The
4835,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"united mass of the system is about one-half that of the Sun, and in"
4836,THE STARRY HEAVENS,point of luminosity they are much inferior to that orb.
4837,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4838,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The star 70 Ophiuchi (fig. 3) may be regarded as typical of a binary
4839,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"system. The components are five seconds apart, and of the fourth and"
4840,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"sixth magnitudes. Their light period is stated to be twenty years, and"
4841,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the combined mass of the system is nearly three times that of the Sun.
4842,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The pair travel in an orbit from fourteen to forty-two times the radius
4843,THE STARRY HEAVENS,of the Earth's orbit; so that when at apastron they are three times as
4844,THE STARRY HEAVENS,distant from each other as when at periastron. They complete a
4845,THE STARRY HEAVENS,revolution in eighty-eight years.
4846,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4847,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The accompanying diagram (fig. 4) is a delineation of the beautiful
4848,THE STARRY HEAVENS,orbits of the components of Gamma Virginis. These may be described as
4849,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"elongated ellipses. Both stars being of equal mass, their orbits are of"
4850,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"equal dimensions, and their common centre of gravity at a point"
4851,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"equidistant from each. Any approach to, or recession from this point,"
4852,THE STARRY HEAVENS,must occur simultaneously with each; they must always occupy
4853,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"corresponding parts of their orbits, and be in apastron and at"
4854,THE STARRY HEAVENS,periastron in the same period of time. The ellipse described by this
4855,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"pair is the most eccentric of known binary orbits, and approaches in"
4856,THE STARRY HEAVENS,form the path pursued by Encke's comet round the Sun. These orbs
4857,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"complete a revolution in 180 years, and when in apastron are seventeen"
4858,THE STARRY HEAVENS,times more remote from each other than when at periastron.

4862,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"From his observation of the motion of Sirius in 1844, Bessel was led to"
4863,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"believe that the brilliant orb was accompanied by another body, whose"
4864,THE STARRY HEAVENS,gravitational attraction was responsible for the irregularities observed
4865,THE STARRY HEAVENS,in the path of the great dog-star when pursuing his journey through
4866,THE STARRY HEAVENS,space. The elements of this hypothetical body were afterwards computed
4867,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"by Peters and Auwers, and its exact position assigned by Safford in"
4868,THE STARRY HEAVENS,1861.

4871,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"when engaged in testing a recently constructed telescope of great power,"
4872,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"directed it on Sirius, and was enabled by good fortune to discover the"
4873,THE STARRY HEAVENS,companion star at a distance of ten seconds from its primary. Since its
4874,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"discovery, the star has pursued with such precision the theoretical path"

4886,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4887,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Astronomers were for some time in doubt as to whether the uneven motion

4889,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"attraction of its obscure attendant, which presented such a marked"
4890,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"contrast to its primary, and several observers were inclined to believe"
4891,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"that the disturbing body still remained undiscovered. When, however, the"
4892,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"density of the lesser star became known, it was discovered that, weight"
4893,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"for weight, that of Sirius exceeded it only in the proportion of two to"
4894,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"one, though as a light-giver the great orb is believed to be 5,000 times"

4901,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"interest to observers. The Egyptians worshipped the star as Sothis, and"
4902,THE STARRY HEAVENS,it was believed to be the abode of the soul of Isis. The nations
4903,THE STARRY HEAVENS,inhabiting the region of the Nile commenced their year with the heliacal
4904,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"rising of Sirius, and its appearance was regarded as a sure forerunner"
4905,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"of the rising of the great river, the fertilising flood of which was"
4906,THE STARRY HEAVENS,attributed to the influence of this beautiful star. It is believed that
4907,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the Mazzaroth in Job is an allusion to this brilliant orb. Among the
4908,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Romans Sirius was regarded as a star of evil omen; its appearance above
4909,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the horizon after the summer solstice was believed to be associated with
4910,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"pestilence and fevers, consequent upon the oppressive heat of the"
4911,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"season of the year. The _dies caniculares_, or dog-days, were reckoned"
4912,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"to begin twenty days before, and to continue for twenty days after, the"
4913,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"heliacal rising of Sirius, the dog-star. During those days a peculiar"
4914,THE STARRY HEAVENS,influence was believed to exist which created diseases in men and

4931,THE STARRY HEAVENS,An irregularity of motion resembling that of Sirius has been detected
4932,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"with regard to Procyon, the lesser dog-star. But in this case the"
4933,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"companion star has not as yet been seen, though a careful search has"
4934,THE STARRY HEAVENS,been made for it with the most powerful of telescopes. Should it be a
4935,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"planetary body, illumined by its primary, its reflected light would not"
4936,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"appear visible to us, even if it were much less remote than it is."
4937,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4938,THE STARRY HEAVENS,We are able only to perceive the effulgence of brilliant suns scattered
4939,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"throughout the regions of space; but besides those, there are doubtless"
4940,THE STARRY HEAVENS,many faintly luminous orbs and opaque bodies of vast dimensions
4941,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"occupying regions unknown to us, but by a knowledge of the existence of"
4942,THE STARRY HEAVENS,which an enlarged conception is conveyed to our minds of the greatness
4943,THE STARRY HEAVENS,of the universe.
4944,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4945,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The most rapid of known revolving pairs is Delta Equulei. The components
4946,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"are so close that only the finest instruments can separate them, and"
4947,THE STARRY HEAVENS,this they cannot do at all times. They accomplish a revolution in eleven
4948,THE STARRY HEAVENS,and a half years. The slowest revolving pair is Zeta Aquarii. The motion
4949,THE STARRY HEAVENS,of the components is so tardy that to complete a circuit of their orbits
4950,THE STARRY HEAVENS,they require a period of about sixteen centuries. Other binary stars
4951,THE STARRY HEAVENS,have had different periods assigned to them; eleven pairs have been
4952,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"computed to revolve round each other in less than fifty years, and"
4953,THE STARRY HEAVENS,fifteen in less than 100 but more than fifty. There are other compound
4954,THE STARRY HEAVENS,stars whose motions appear to be much more leisurely than those just
4955,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"mentioned, and although no orbital movement has, so far, been detected"
4956,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"among them, yet, so vast is the scale upon which the sidereal system is"
4957,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"constructed, that thousands of years must elapse before they can have"
4958,THE STARRY HEAVENS,accomplished a revolution of their orbits.
4959,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4960,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"The Pole Star is an optical double, but the components are of very"
4961,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"unequal magnitude. The Pole Star itself is of the second magnitude, but"
4962,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"its companion is only of the ninth, and on account of its minuteness is"
4963,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"regarded as a good test for telescopes of small aperture. Mizar, in the"
4964,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"constellation Ursa Major, is a beautiful double star. The components are"
4965,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"wide apart, and can be easily observed with a small instrument."
4966,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4967,THE STARRY HEAVENS,There is a remarkable star in the constellation of the Lyre (Epsilon
4968,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Lyræ), described as a double double. This object can just be"
4969,THE STARRY HEAVENS,distinguished by a person with keen eyesight as consisting of two stars;
4970,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"when observed with a telescope they appear widely separated, and each"
4971,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"star is seen to have a companion, the entire system forming two binary"
4972,THE STARRY HEAVENS,pairs in active revolution. The pair which first cross the meridian
4973,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"complete a revolution in about 2,000 years; the second pair have a more"
4974,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"rapid motion, and accomplish it in half that time. The two pairs are"
4975,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"believed to be physically connected, and revolve round their common"
4976,THE STARRY HEAVENS,centre of gravity in a period of time not much under one million years.
4977,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4978,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Cor Caroli, in Canes Venatici, is a pleasing double star, the components"
4979,THE STARRY HEAVENS,being of a pale white and lilac colour.
4980,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4981,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Albireo, in the constellation of the Swan, is one of the loveliest of"
4982,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"double stars. The larger component is of the third magnitude, and of a"
4983,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"golden yellow colour; the smaller of the sixth magnitude, and of a"
4984,THE STARRY HEAVENS,sapphire blue.
4985,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4986,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Epsilon Boötis, known also as Mirac, and called by Admiral Smyth"
4987,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"'Pulcherrima,' on account of its surpassing beauty, is a delicate object"
4988,THE STARRY HEAVENS,of charming appearance. The components of this lovely star are of the
4989,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"third and seventh magnitudes: the primary orange, the secondary"
4990,THE STARRY HEAVENS,sea-green.
4991,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
4992,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"The late Mr. R. A. Proctor, in describing a binary star system, writes"
4993,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"as follows: 'If we regard a pair of stars as forming a double sun, round"
4994,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"which--or, rather, round the common centre of which--other orbs revolve"
4995,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"as planets, we are struck by the difference between such a scheme and"
4996,THE STARRY HEAVENS,our own solar system; but we find the difference yet more surprising
4997,THE STARRY HEAVENS,when we consider the possibility that in some such schemes each
4998,THE STARRY HEAVENS,component sun may have its own distinct system of dependent worlds. In
4999,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the former case the ordinary state of things would probably be such that
5000,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"both suns would be above the horizon at the same time, and then,"
5001,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"probably, their distinctive peculiarities would only be recognisable"
5002,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"when one chanced to pass over the disc of the other, as our Moon passes"
5003,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"over the Sun's disc in eclipses. For short intervals of time, however,"
5004,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"at rising or setting, one or other would be visible alone; and the"
5005,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"phenomena of sunset and sunrise must therefore be very varied, and also"
5006,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"exquisitely beautiful, in worlds circling round such double suns. But"
5007,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"when each sun has a separate system, even more remarkable relations must"
5008,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"be presented. For each system of dependent worlds, besides its own"
5009,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"proper sun, must have another sun--less splendid, perhaps (because"
5010,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"farther off), but still brighter beyond comparison than our moon at the"
5011,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"full. And, according to the position of any planet of either system,"
5012,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"there will result for the time being either an interchange of suns,"
5013,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"instead of the change from night to day, or else double sunlight during"
5014,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the day, and a corresponding intensified contrast between night and day."
5015,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Where the two suns are very unequal or very differently coloured, or"
5016,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"where the orbital path of each is very eccentric, so that they are"
5017,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"sometimes close together and at others far apart, the varieties in the"
5018,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"worlds circling round either, or around the common centre of both, must"
5019,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"be yet more remarkable. ""It must be confessed,"" we may well say with Sir"
5020,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"John Herschel, ""that we have here a strangely wide and novel field for"
5021,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"speculative excursions, and one which it is not easy to avoid"
5022,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"luxuriating in.""'"
5023,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5024,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Anyone who takes a cursory glance at the heavens on a clear night can
5025,THE STARRY HEAVENS,readily perceive that there exists considerable diversity of colour
5026,THE STARRY HEAVENS,among the stars. The contrast between some is pronounced and well
5027,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"marked, whilst others exhibit refined gradations of hue."
5028,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5029,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The most numerous class of stars are those which are described as white
5030,THE STARRY HEAVENS,or colourless. They comprise about one-half of the stars visible to the
5031,THE STARRY HEAVENS,naked eye. Among the most conspicuous examples of this type are
5032,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Sirius--whose diamond blaze is sometimes mingled with an occasional
5033,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"flash of blue and red--Altair, Spica, Castor, Regulus, Rigel, all the"
5034,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"stars of Ursa Major with the exception of one, and Vega--a glittering"
5035,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"gem of pale sapphire, almost colourless. The light emitted by stars of"
5036,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"this class gives a continuous spectrum, the predominating element being"
5037,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"hydrogen, having a very elevated temperature and under relatively high"
5038,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"pressure. The vapours of iron, sodium, magnesium, and other metals, are"
5039,THE STARRY HEAVENS,indicated as existing in small quantities.
5040,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5041,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The second class of stars is that to which our Sun belongs. They are of
5042,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"a yellow colour, and embrace two-thirds of the remaining stars. The most"
5043,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"prominent examples of this type are Arcturus, Capella, Aldebaran,"
5044,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Procyon, and Pollux. Hydrogen does not predominate so much in these as"
5045,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"in the Sirian stars, and their spectra resemble closely the solar"
5046,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"spectrum, indicating that they are composed of elements similar to those"
5047,THE STARRY HEAVENS,which exist in the Sun.
5048,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5049,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"The star which bears the nearest resemblance to our Sun, both as regards"
5050,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the colour of its light and physical structure, is Capella, the most"
5051,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"conspicuous star in the constellation Auriga, and one of the leading"
5052,THE STARRY HEAVENS,brilliants in the Northern Hemisphere. Its spectrum presents all the
5053,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"characteristics observed in the solar spectrum, and there exists an"
5054,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"almost identical similarity in their physical constitution, though"
5055,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Capella is a much more magnificent orb than the Sun.
5056,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5057,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"The third class of stars includes those which are of a ruddy hue, such"
5058,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"as Betelgeux in the right shoulder of Orion, Antares in Scorpio, and"
5059,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Alpha Herculis. Their spectra present a banded or columnar appearance,"
5060,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"and there is greater absorption, especially of the blue rays of light."
5061,THE STARRY HEAVENS,It is believed that the temperature of stars of this colour is not so
5062,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"elevated as that of those belonging to the other two orders, and that"
5063,THE STARRY HEAVENS,this is a sufficient reason to account for the different appearance of
5064,THE STARRY HEAVENS,their spectra.
5065,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5066,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"The aid of a good telescope is, however, necessary to enable us to"
5067,THE STARRY HEAVENS,perceive the varied colours and tints of the sparkling gems with which
5068,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Nature has adorned her star-built edifice of the universe. Most of the
5069,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"precious stones on Earth have their counterparts in the heavens,"
5070,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"presenting in a jewelled form contrasts of colour, pleasing harmonies,"
5071,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"and endless variety of shade. The diamond, sapphire, emerald, amethyst,"
5072,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"topaz, and ruby sparkle among crowds of stars of more sombre hue. Agate,"
5073,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"chalcedony, onyx, opal, beryl, lapis-lazuli, and aquamarine are"
5074,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"represented by the radiant sheen emanating from distant suns, displaying"
5075,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"an inexhaustible variety of colour, blended in tints of untold harmony."
5076,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5077,THE STARRY HEAVENS,It is among double stars that the richest and most varied colours
5078,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"predominate. There are pairs of white, yellow, orange, and red stars;"
5079,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"yellow and blue, yellow and pale emerald, yellow and rose red, yellow"
5080,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"and fawn, green and gold, azure and crimson, golden and azure, orange"
5081,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"and emerald, orange and lilac, orange and purple, orange and green,"
5082,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"white and blue, white and lilac, lilac and dark purple, &c., &c. There"
5083,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"are companion stars revolving round their primaries, coloured olive,"
5084,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"lilac, russet, fawn, dun, buff, grey, and other shades indistinguishable"
5085,THE STARRY HEAVENS,by any name.
5086,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5087,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Our knowledge of binary star systems brings us to what may be regarded
5088,THE STARRY HEAVENS,as the threshold of the fabric of the heavens. For it is known that
5089,THE STARRY HEAVENS,other systems exist into the construction of which numerous stars enter.
5090,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"These form intricate and complex stellar arrangements, in which the"
5091,THE STARRY HEAVENS,component stars are physically united and retained in their orbits by
5092,THE STARRY HEAVENS,their mutual attraction.

5101,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5102,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"TRIPLE, QUADRUPLE, AND MULTIPLE STARS.--These, when observed with the"
5103,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"naked eye, appear as single stars, but, when examined with a high"
5104,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"magnifying power, each lucid point can be resolved into several"
5105,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"component stars. They vary in number from three to half a dozen or more,"
5106,THE STARRY HEAVENS,and form systems of a more complex character than what are observed in
5107,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the case of binary stars. In the usual construction of a triple system,"
5108,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the secondary star of a binary is resolvable into two, each star being"
5109,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"in mutual revolution, whilst they both gravitate round their primary. By"
5110,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"another arrangement, a close pair control the movements of a distant"
5111,THE STARRY HEAVENS,attendant.
5112,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5113,THE STARRY HEAVENS,One of the most interesting of triple stars is the tricoloured Gamma
5114,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Andromedæ. The brilliant components of this system have their
5115,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"counterparts in the topaz, the emerald, and the sapphire--the larger"
5116,THE STARRY HEAVENS,star is of the third magnitude and of a golden yellow colour; the
5117,THE STARRY HEAVENS,secondary of the fifth magnitude and of an emerald green. These stars
5118,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"are ten seconds apart, and, though they have been under observation"
5119,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"since 1777, no orbital movement has as yet been detected, but their"
5120,THE STARRY HEAVENS,common proper motion indicates their close relationship and physical
5121,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"connection. In 1842, Otto Struve discovered that the companion star is"
5122,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"itself double, and round it there gravitates a sapphire sun, which is"
5123,THE STARRY HEAVENS,believed to accomplish a revolution of its orbit in about 500 years. If
5124,THE STARRY HEAVENS,round those suns there should be circling planetary systems of worlds
5125,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"inhabited by intelligent beings, the varied effects produced by the"
5126,THE STARRY HEAVENS,light emanating from those different coloured orbs would be of a very
5127,THE STARRY HEAVENS,beautiful and pleasing nature.
5128,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5129,THE STARRY HEAVENS,A system suggestive of the endless variety of stellar arrangement that
5130,THE STARRY HEAVENS,exists throughout the sidereal regions is apparent in the case of the
5131,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"triple star Zeta Cancri. Two of the stars, of magnitudes six and seven,"
5132,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"form a binary in rapid revolution, the components of which complete a"
5133,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"circuit of their orbits in fifty-eight years, whilst the more distant"
5134,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"third star, of almost similar magnitude, accomplishes a wide orbital"
5135,THE STARRY HEAVENS,ellipse round the other two in 500 or 600 years. These stars have been
5136,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"closely observed by astronomers during the past forty years, with the"
5137,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"result that their motions have appeared most perplexing, and complicated"
5138,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"beyond precedent. 'If this be really a ternary system,' wrote Sir John"
5139,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Herschel, 'connected by the mutual attraction of its parts, its"
5140,THE STARRY HEAVENS,perturbations will present one of the most intricate problems in
5141,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"physical astronomy.' The second star revolves round its primary, whilst"
5142,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the third pursues a retrograde course, but its path, instead of being"
5143,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"even, presents the appearance of a series of circular loopings, in"
5144,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"traversing which the star alternately quickens and slackens its pace,"
5145,THE STARRY HEAVENS,or at times appears to be stationary.
5146,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5147,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Astronomers have arrived at the conclusion that these perturbations are
5148,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"produced by the presence of a fourth member, which, though invisible, is"
5149,THE STARRY HEAVENS,probably the most massive of the system--perhaps a magnificent world
5150,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"teeming with animated beings, and attended by three suns which gravitate"
5151,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"round it, dispensing light and heat to meet the requirements of the"
5152,THE STARRY HEAVENS,various forms of life which exist on its surface. In this system we have
5153,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"an arrangement the reverse of what exists in the solar system, where all"
5154,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the planets revolve round a predominant sun; but here there is a strange
5155,THE STARRY HEAVENS,verification of the old Ptolemaic belief with regard to the path of a
5156,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"sun, though in this instance there are three suns circling round a dark"
5157,THE STARRY HEAVENS,globe which they illumine and vivify.
5158,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5159,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Triple stars occur with comparative frequency throughout the heavens. In
5160,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Monoceros there is a fine triple star, discovered by Herschel, which he"
5161,THE STARRY HEAVENS,describes as 'one of the most beautiful sights in the heavens.' The
5162,THE STARRY HEAVENS,stars Xi and Beta Scorpii form triple systems in which the components
5163,THE STARRY HEAVENS,are differently arranged. In Xi the primary and secondary consist of two
5164,THE STARRY HEAVENS,revolving stars which control the movements of a distant attendant; in
5165,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Beta the primary and secondary stars are in mutual revolution, whilst"
5166,THE STARRY HEAVENS,round the former there circles a very close minute companion. There are
5167,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"doubtless many binary stars which, if examined with adequate telescopic"
5168,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"power, would resolve themselves into triple and multiple systems, but"
5169,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the profound distances of those objects render the detection of their
5170,THE STARRY HEAVENS,components a most difficult task.
5171,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5172,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Quadruple stars are usually arranged in pairs, _i.e._ the primary and"
5173,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"secondary of a binary system are each resolvable into two, forming two"
5174,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"pairs, each pair being in mutual revolution, while they both gravitate"
5175,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"round their common centre of gravity. Epsilon Lyræ, which has been"
5176,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"described as a double double, is an example of a quadruple system, and"
5177,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Nu Scorpii is of a similar construction, but more beautiful because its"
5178,THE STARRY HEAVENS,components are in closer proximity to each other. Close upon twenty of
5179,THE STARRY HEAVENS,those double double systems have been discovered in different parts of
5180,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the heavens.
5181,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5182,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"One of the most interesting of quadruple systems is Theta Orionis, which"
5183,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"is situated in the Great Nebula, by which it is surrounded. This star,"
5184,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"when observed with a telescope of low power, can be at once resolved"
5185,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"into four separate lucent points, so arranged as to form a quadrilateral"
5186,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"figure or trapezium. They are of the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth"
5187,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"magnitudes, and described as pale white, garnet, faint lilac, and red."
5188,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Though they have been under careful observation for upwards of two
5189,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"centuries, no perceptible motion has been perceived as occurring among"
5190,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"them, nor has there been any change in their relative positions--they"
5191,THE STARRY HEAVENS,appear to be perfectly motionless; but we must not infer from this that
5192,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"no physical bond of union exists between them, for they are situated at"
5193,THE STARRY HEAVENS,an amazing distance from the Earth. Ascending higher in the scale of
5194,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"celestial architecture, we have multiple stars forming systems still"
5195,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"more elaborate and complex, into the structure of which numerous stars"
5196,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"enter, and they, as they increase in number, gradually merge into"
5197,THE STARRY HEAVENS,star-clusters.
5198,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5199,THE STARRY HEAVENS,If we assume that around each of the components of a multiple star there
5200,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"circles a retinue of planetary worlds, we are confronted with a most"
5201,THE STARRY HEAVENS,perplexing problem as to how the dynamical stability of a system so
5202,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"different from, and so vastly more complicated than, that of our solar"
5203,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"system is maintained--where, as it were, suns and planets"
5204,THE STARRY HEAVENS,intermingle--how numerous circling orbs can accomplish their revolutions
5205,THE STARRY HEAVENS,without being swayed and deflected from their paths by the gravitational
5206,THE STARRY HEAVENS,attraction of adjacent members of the same system. Perplexing though the
5207,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"arrangement of such a scheme may be to our conception, yet, each orb has"
5208,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"been weighed, poised, and adjusted by Infinite Wisdom, to perform its"
5209,THE STARRY HEAVENS,intricate motions in synchronous harmony with other members of the
5210,THE STARRY HEAVENS,system--all moving in unison like the parts of a complicated piece of
5211,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"mechanism, and maintained in stable equilibrium by their mutual"
5212,THE STARRY HEAVENS,attraction--
5213,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5214,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Mystical dance, which yonder starry sphere"
5215,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Of planets and of fixed in all her wheels

5217,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Eccentric, intervolved, yet regular"
5218,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Then most, when most irregular they seem;"
5219,THE STARRY HEAVENS,And in their motions harmony divine
5220,THE STARRY HEAVENS,So smooths her charming tones that God's own ear
5221,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Listens delighted.--v. 620-27.
5222,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5223,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"All the natural phenomena with which we are familiar would, in the case"
5224,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"of planets revolving round the component suns of a multiple system, be"
5225,THE STARRY HEAVENS,of a different kind or altogether absent. Instead of being illumined by
5226,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"one sun, those worlds would, at certain times, have several suns--some"
5227,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"more distant than others--above their horizons, and upon very rare"
5228,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"occasions, if ever, would there be an entire absence of all of those"
5229,THE STARRY HEAVENS,orbs from their skies. Consequently there would be no year such as we
5230,THE STARRY HEAVENS,are familiar with; no regular sequence of seasons similar to what is
5231,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"experienced on Earth; no alternation of day and night, for there would"
5232,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"be '_no night there_,' though, in the absence of the primary orb, the"
5233,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"light emitted by distant suns, whilst sufficient to banish night, and"
5234,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"beyond comparison brighter than the Moon when at full, would, in the"
5235,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"diminution of its intensity from that of noonday, be as grateful a"
5236,THE STARRY HEAVENS,change as that of from day to night which occurs on our globe.
5237,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5238,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Should those suns be differently coloured, each emitting its own"
5239,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"peculiar shade of light as it appears above the horizon, the varied"
5240,THE STARRY HEAVENS,aspects of the perpetual day enjoyed by the inhabitants of those
5241,THE STARRY HEAVENS,circling worlds present to the imagination harmonies of light and shade
5242,THE STARRY HEAVENS,over which it is pleasant to linger.
5243,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5244,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"TEMPORARY, PERIODICAL, AND VARIABLE STARS.--It may seem remarkable that"
5245,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"among so many thousands of stars which spangle the firmament, there"
5246,THE STARRY HEAVENS,should occur no very perceptible change or variation in their aspect
5247,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"and brilliancy. From age to age they present the same appearance, shine"
5248,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"with the same undiminished splendour, and rise and set with the same"
5249,THE STARRY HEAVENS,regularity. So that from time immemorial the stars have been regarded by
5250,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"mankind as the embodiment of all that is eternal and unchangeable. Yet,"
5251,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the serenity of the celestial regions does not always remain
5252,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"undisturbed--at occasional times a 'Nova,' or new star, blazes forth"
5253,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"unexpectedly in the heavens, and perplexes astronomers; and, after"
5254,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"shining with a varying degree of brilliancy for a few weeks or months,"
5255,THE STARRY HEAVENS,gradually diminishes in size and brightness and eventually becomes lost
5256,THE STARRY HEAVENS,to sight.
5257,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5258,THE STARRY HEAVENS,A record has been kept of about twenty temporary stars that have been
5259,THE STARRY HEAVENS,observed at various periods since the time that reliable data of those
5260,THE STARRY HEAVENS,objects have been published. Pliny mentions the appearance of a new star
5261,THE STARRY HEAVENS,in the time of Hipparchus (134 B.C.); it was seen in the constellation
5262,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"of the Scorpion, and it is said that it was the apparition of this star"
5263,THE STARRY HEAVENS,which induced the celebrated astronomer to construct what is known as
5264,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the earliest star catalogue. A new star is said to have become visible
5265,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"when the Emperor Honorius ruled, and another during the reign of the"
5266,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Emperor Otho, about 945 A.D. In May 1012 a new star appeared in Aries,"
5267,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"and in July 1203 another was observed in Scorpio, which resembled"
5268,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Saturn. The most remarkable star of this kind was one observed by Tycho
5269,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Brahé, which appeared in the constellation Cassiopeia. He first"
5270,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"perceived it on November 11, 1572. In lustre it equalled Jupiter, and"
5271,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"when at its brightest rivalled Venus; it was visible at noonday, and at"
5272,THE STARRY HEAVENS,night its light could be perceived through strata of cloud which
5273,THE STARRY HEAVENS,rendered all other stars invisible. The star maintained its brilliancy
5274,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"for three weeks, when it became of a yellowish colour and perceptibly"
5275,THE STARRY HEAVENS,decreased in size; it afterwards assumed a ruddy hue resembling
5276,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Aldebaran, and, diminishing gradually in magnitude and brightness,"
5277,THE STARRY HEAVENS,ceased to be visible in March 1574. It twinkled more than the other
5278,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"stars, and during the time it could be perceived its position remained"
5279,THE STARRY HEAVENS,unchanged. In 1604 a conspicuous new star burst forth in Ophiuchus. It
5280,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"surpassed in brilliancy stars of the first magnitude, and outshone the"
5281,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"planet Jupiter, which was in its proximity. Kepler observed this star,"
5282,THE STARRY HEAVENS,and described it as 'sparkling like a diamond with prismatic tints.' It
5283,THE STARRY HEAVENS,soon began to decline after its appearance; in March 1605 it had shrunk
5284,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"to the dimensions of a third-magnitude star, and in a year later it"
5285,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"became entirely lost to view. Other stars of the same class, though of a"
5286,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"less conspicuous character, have been observed at occasional times."
5287,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Anthelme, a Carthusian monk, discovered one near Beta Cygni in 1670;"
5288,THE STARRY HEAVENS,another appeared in Ophiuchus in 1848; one in Scorpio in 1860; one in
5289,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Corona Borealis in 1866; in Cygnus in 1876; in Andromeda in 1885; and in
5290,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Auriga in 1892.
5291,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5292,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Various theories have been advanced in order to account for the sudden
5293,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"outbursts of those stars, the light from which has probably occupied"
5294,THE STARRY HEAVENS,not much less than one hundred years in its passage hither. It has been
5295,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"suggested that the collision of two suns, or of two great masses of"
5296,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"matter, would create such phenomena; but, apart from the improbability"
5297,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"of such a catastrophe occurring among the celestial orbs, the rapid"
5298,THE STARRY HEAVENS,subsidence in the luminosity of the observed objects would indicate that
5299,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the outburst was produced by causes of a more rapidly transitory nature
5300,THE STARRY HEAVENS,than what would result from the collision of two condensed masses of
5301,THE STARRY HEAVENS,matter. A collision occurring between two swarms of meteors has been
5302,THE STARRY HEAVENS,suggested as one way of accounting for the sudden appearance of those
5303,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"stars; but another, and more plausible, explanation is that they are"
5304,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"produced by a great eruption of glowing gas from the interior of a sun,"
5305,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"causing an enormous increase in its luminosity, which subsides after a"
5306,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"time, and is succeeded by a normal condition of things. It has been"
5307,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"observed that all those temporary stars, with the exception of two, have"
5308,THE STARRY HEAVENS,appeared in the region of the Milky Way. In this luminous zone the
5309,THE STARRY HEAVENS,condensation of small gaseous stars and nebulæ is more pronounced than
5310,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"in any other part of the heavens, and this would seem to indicate that"
5311,THE STARRY HEAVENS,there may be cosmical changes taking place among them which need not be
5312,THE STARRY HEAVENS,associated with the occurrence of catastrophes resulting in the
5313,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"conflagration of worlds, and that Nature, in accomplishing her purposes,"
5314,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"does not overstep the uniform working of her laws, upon which depend the"
5315,THE STARRY HEAVENS,stability and existence of the universe.
5316,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5317,THE STARRY HEAVENS,PERIODICAL AND VARIABLE STARS are distinguished from other similar
5318,THE STARRY HEAVENS,objects by the fluctuations which occur in the quantity of light emitted
5319,THE STARRY HEAVENS,by them. The difference in the luminosity of some stars is at times so
5320,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"marked that, in a few weeks or months, they decline from the first or"
5321,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"second magnitudes to invisibility, and, after the expiration of a"
5322,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"certain period, they again gradually regain their pristine condition."
5323,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"When these changes take place with regular recurrence, they are called"
5324,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"'periodical;' when they occur in a variable and uncertain manner, they"
5325,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"are called 'irregular.' About 300 stars are known as variable, but the"
5326,THE STARRY HEAVENS,majority of them are telescopic objects. Their periodical changes of
5327,THE STARRY HEAVENS,brilliancy present every degree of variety; in some stars they are
5328,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"scarcely perceptible and occur at long intervals; in others, changes of"
5329,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"brightness occur in a few hours or days, by which the light emitted is"
5330,THE STARRY HEAVENS,intensified many hundreds of times.
5331,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5332,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Some stars accomplish their cycle of change in a few days, many in a few"
5333,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"weeks or months, and there are others which do not complete their"
5334,THE STARRY HEAVENS,periods until the expiration of a number of years.
5335,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5336,THE STARRY HEAVENS,One of the most remarkable of variable stars is called Mira 'the
5337,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"wonderful,' in the constellation Cetus. When at its maximum brilliancy"
5338,THE STARRY HEAVENS,it shines for two or three weeks as a star of the second magnitude. It
5339,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"then begins to gradually decline, and at the end of three months becomes"
5340,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"invisible. It remains invisible for five months, and then reappears, and"
5341,THE STARRY HEAVENS,during the ensuing three months it regains by degrees its former
5342,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"brilliancy. Mira completes a cycle of its changes in 334 days, and,"
5343,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"during that time, oscillates between a star of the second and tenth"
5344,THE STARRY HEAVENS,magnitude. The variability of Mira Ceti was first observed by David
5345,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Fabricius in the sixteenth century.
5346,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5347,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Another remarkable star is Eta Argus, which is surrounded by the great"
5348,THE STARRY HEAVENS,nebula in the constellation Argo Navis. It is invisible to the naked
5349,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"eye, but in the telescope it has a reddish appearance, and is slightly"
5350,THE STARRY HEAVENS,brighter than the stars in its vicinity. It was first observed by Halley
5351,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"in 1677, and it was then of the fourth magnitude. In 1751 it had risen"
5352,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"to the second magnitude, and maintained its position as a star of this"
5353,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"class until 1837, when, on December 16 of that year, its brilliancy"
5354,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"suddenly increased, and it equalled in a short time Alpha Centauri. It"
5355,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"reached its maximum in 1843, and then it was surpassed only by Sirius."
5356,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"It maintained its brilliancy for about ten years. In 1858, it declined"
5357,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"to the second magnitude, in 1859 to the third, and, gradually"
5358,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"diminishing, it became invisible to the naked eye in 1868. It is now of"
5359,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the seventh magnitude, and is again increasing, and may soon resume its"
5360,THE STARRY HEAVENS,position among the other stars. It is believed to have a period of
5361,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"seventy years, and in that time its light ebbs and flows between the"
5362,THE STARRY HEAVENS,seventh and first magnitudes.
5363,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5364,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"The most interesting variable star in the heavens is Algol (the demon),"
5365,THE STARRY HEAVENS,in the constellation Perseus. Its light fluctuations can be observed
5366,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"without the aid of a telescope, and it completes a cycle of its changes"
5367,THE STARRY HEAVENS,in two or three days. For about two days and thirteen hours it is
5368,THE STARRY HEAVENS,conspicuously visible as a star of the second magnitude; it then begins
5369,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"to decline, and in about four hours sinks to the dimensions of a"
5370,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"fourth-magnitude star; it remains in this condition for twenty minutes,"
5371,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"and then increases gradually until, at the expiration of four hours, it"
5372,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"regains its former brilliancy, which it sustains for two days and"
5373,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"thirteen hours, when it again goes through the same cycle of changes in"
5374,THE STARRY HEAVENS,a precisely similar manner to what has been described. Astrologers have
5375,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"ascribed many evil influences to the demon star, which adorned the head"
5376,THE STARRY HEAVENS,of Medusa; nor did it escape the observation of ancient astronomers that
5377,THE STARRY HEAVENS,this malevolent orb is--as a modern writer amusingly remarks--slowly
5378,THE STARRY HEAVENS,winking at us from out the depths of space.
5379,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5380,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Variable stars are found in greater numbers in some parts of the heavens
5381,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"than in others. Those of a white colour, and with shorter and more"
5382,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"regular periods, are most numerous in the region of the Milky Way; those"
5383,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"that are small, with long periods and of a reddish hue, are more widely"
5384,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"removed from that zone. Stars of this class are all very remote, and no"
5385,THE STARRY HEAVENS,attempt has as yet been made to ascertain the parallax of Algol.
5386,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5387,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Several theories have been suggested in order to account for the
5388,THE STARRY HEAVENS,periodical brilliancy of those stars. It has been suggested that the
5389,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"stars have opaque non-luminous patches on their surfaces, and that"
5390,THE STARRY HEAVENS,during axial rotation their light ebbs and flows according as the dark
5391,THE STARRY HEAVENS,or bright portions are turned towards us. This theory is highly
5392,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"improbable. Another and more plausible reason, especially with regard to"
5393,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"short period variables, is, that around those stars there revolve opaque"
5394,THE STARRY HEAVENS,bodies or satellites which at times intercept a portion of their light
5395,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"by producing a partial eclipse of their discs, similar to that caused by"
5396,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the dark body of the Moon when passing between the Sun and the Earth.
5397,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5398,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"It is now known that in the case of variables of the Algol type, the"
5399,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"periodical fluctuations of their light arises from this cause, and that"
5400,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"round Algol there is a dark world or satellite travelling, which"
5401,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"completes a revolution of its orbit in about sixty-nine hours, and that,"
5402,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"during each circuit, it intercepts one half of the light of its primary"
5403,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"by partially eclipsing the orb, and thereby creating a diminution in its"
5404,THE STARRY HEAVENS,apparent magnitude which becomes perceptible at recurring intervals.
5405,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5406,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"STAR GROUPS.--These are plentifully scattered over the heavens and, by"
5407,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"their conspicuous brilliancy, add to the grandeur and magnificence of"
5408,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the midnight sky. The Hyades in Taurus, of which Aldebaran is the chief,"
5409,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"forming the eye of the Bull, attract attention."
5410,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5411,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"The stars in Coma Bernices form a rich group; the sickle in Leo, the"
5412,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"seven stars in Ursa Major, and those in Cassiopeia and Aquila are"
5413,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"familiarly known to all observers. Besides these, there are many other"
5414,THE STARRY HEAVENS,groups and aggregations of stars which adorn the celestial vault and
5415,THE STARRY HEAVENS,enhance the beauty of the heavens.
5416,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5417,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"STAR CLUSTERS.--On observing the heavens on a clear, dark night, there"
5418,THE STARRY HEAVENS,can be seen in different parts of the sky closely aggregated groups of
5419,THE STARRY HEAVENS,stars called clusters. In some instances the component stars are so near
5420,THE STARRY HEAVENS,together that the naked eye is unable to discern the individual members
5421,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"of the cluster. They then assume an indistinct, hazy, cloudlike"
5422,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"appearance. Upwards of 500 clusters are known to astronomers, the"
5423,THE STARRY HEAVENS,majority of which are very remote. Many of them contain thousands of
5424,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"stars compressed into a very small space, and others are so distant that"
5425,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the largest telescopes are incapable of resolving their nebulous
5426,THE STARRY HEAVENS,appearance into separate stars.
5427,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5428,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Star clusters have been arranged into two classes, 'irregular' and"
5429,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"'globular;' but no sharp line of demarcation exists between them, though"
5430,THE STARRY HEAVENS,each have their distinctive peculiarities. Irregular clusters consist of
5431,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"aggregations of stars brought promiscuously together, and presenting an"
5432,THE STARRY HEAVENS,appearance devoid of any structural arrangement. They are of different
5433,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"shapes and sizes, possess no distinct outline, and are not condensed"
5434,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"towards their centre, like those that are globular. On examination, they"
5435,THE STARRY HEAVENS,present an intricate reticulated appearance; streams and branches of
5436,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"stars extend outwards from the parent cluster, sometimes in rows and"
5437,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"sinuous lines, and, in other instances, diverging from a common centre,"
5438,THE STARRY HEAVENS,forming sprays. Sometimes the stars are seen to follow each other on the
5439,THE STARRY HEAVENS,same curve which terminates in loops and arches of symmetrical
5440,THE STARRY HEAVENS,proportions.
5441,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5442,THE STARRY HEAVENS,There are three conspicuous clusters in the northern sky that are
5443,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"visible to the naked eye--viz. the Pleiades in Taurus, the Great Cluster"
5444,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"in the sword-handle of Perseus, and Praesepe in Cancer, commonly called"
5445,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the Beehive.
5446,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5447,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The cluster which from time immemorial has had bestowed upon it the
5448,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"chief attention of mankind are the beautiful Pleiades or Seven Sisters,"
5449,THE STARRY HEAVENS,and intertwined among its stars are the legendary and mythological
5450,THE STARRY HEAVENS,beliefs of ancient nations and untutored tribes inhabiting the different
5451,THE STARRY HEAVENS,regions of the globe. When viewed with a telescope of moderate size the
5452,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"cluster appears as a scattered group, and numerous stars become visible"
5453,THE STARRY HEAVENS,that are imperceptible to ordinary vision.
5454,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5455,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"In the sword-handle of Perseus there is a cluster which, to the naked"
5456,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"eye, appears as a small patch of luminous cloud. This inconspicuous"
5457,THE STARRY HEAVENS,object when observed with an instrument of moderate power is resolved
5458,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"into a magnificent assemblage of stars, and presents a spectacle which"
5459,THE STARRY HEAVENS,creates in the mind of the beholder mingled feelings of admiration and
5460,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"amazement. No telescope has yet penetrated its utmost depths, or"
5461,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"revealed all the glories of this shining region, crowded with glittering"
5462,THE STARRY HEAVENS,points of light comparable in number to the pebbles strewn on the shore
5463,THE STARRY HEAVENS,of a troubled sea.
5464,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5465,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The cluster Praesepe in Cancer is visible on a clear night to the
5466,THE STARRY HEAVENS,unaided eye as a small nebula. This object attracted the attention of
5467,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Galileo, to which he applied his newly invented telescope, and was"
5468,THE STARRY HEAVENS,delighted to find that his glass was capable of resolving it into a
5469,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"group of stars thirty-six in number, and all of comparatively large"
5470,THE STARRY HEAVENS,magnitude. The disappearance of Praesepe in consequence of the
5471,THE STARRY HEAVENS,condensation of vapour in the atmosphere was regarded by the ancients as
5472,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"a sure indication of approaching rain. In the same constellation, near"
5473,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the Crab's southern claw, there is another rich cluster, which consists"
5474,THE STARRY HEAVENS,of 200 stars of the ninth and tenth magnitudes.
5475,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5476,THE STARRY HEAVENS,In Sobieski's Shield there is a magnificent fan-shaped cluster of minute
5477,THE STARRY HEAVENS,stars with a prominent one in its centre; and in the constellation of
5478,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the Southern Cross there is a cluster which, on account of the varied"
5479,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"colours of its component stars, has been compared by Sir John Herschel"
5480,THE STARRY HEAVENS,to 'a piece of rich fancy jewellery;' eight of the principal stars being
5481,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"coloured red, green, and blue."
5482,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5483,THE STARRY HEAVENS,GLOBULAR CLUSTERS.--These have been described by Herschel as 'the most
5484,THE STARRY HEAVENS,magnificent objects that can be seen in the heavens.' They are all very
5485,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"remote, of a rounded form, and when viewed with a telescope present the"
5486,THE STARRY HEAVENS,appearance of 'a ball of stars.' In some clusters the constituent stars
5487,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"are distinguishable as minute points of light; in others, more remote,"
5488,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"they are of a coarse granular texture, and in those still more distant"
5489,THE STARRY HEAVENS,they resemble a 'heap of golden sand.' Some clusters are situated at
5490,THE STARRY HEAVENS,such a profound distance in space that it is impossible with the most
5491,THE STARRY HEAVENS,powerful of telescopes to define their stellar structure; all that can
5492,THE STARRY HEAVENS,be distinguished of these is a cloudy luminosity resembling in
5493,THE STARRY HEAVENS,appearance an irresolvable nebula. Globular clusters usually present a
5494,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"radiated appearance. Rays, branches, and spiral-shaped streams of stars"
5495,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"appear to flow from the circumference of some; and, in other instances,"
5496,THE STARRY HEAVENS,fantastic appendages of stars project outwards from the parent cluster.
5497,THE STARRY HEAVENS,There doubtless exists much variety in the structural arrangement of
5498,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"these clusters, and an equal diversity in the magnitude and number of"
5499,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the stars which enter into their formation. The stars in some clusters
5500,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"may equal those of the first magnitude, and in others they may not"
5501,THE STARRY HEAVENS,exceed in dimensions the minor planets. In the telescope they vary in
5502,THE STARRY HEAVENS,size from the eleventh to the fifteenth magnitude; the smaller stars
5503,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"occupy the centre of a cluster, whilst the larger ones are found near"
5504,THE STARRY HEAVENS,its circumference. Globular clusters are more condensed towards their
5505,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"centre than those of irregular shape, and some have a nucleated"
5506,THE STARRY HEAVENS,appearance. This apparent condensation is not altogether owing to the
5507,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"depth of star strata as viewed from the circumference of the cluster,"
5508,THE STARRY HEAVENS,but there appears to exist an attractive force (probably gravitational)
5509,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"which draws the stars towards its centre, and if this 'clustering power'"
5510,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"were not opposed by some other counteracting force, those bodies would"
5511,THE STARRY HEAVENS,coalesce into one mass. It may be 'that a centrifugal impulse
5512,THE STARRY HEAVENS,predominates by which full-grown orbs are driven from the nursery of
5513,THE STARRY HEAVENS,suns in which they were reared to seek their separate fortunes and enter
5514,THE STARRY HEAVENS,on an independent career elsewhere.'
5515,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5516,THE STARRY HEAVENS,It is not known how the dynamical equilibrium of a star cluster is
5517,THE STARRY HEAVENS,maintained; and on account of its extreme distance no motion is
5518,THE STARRY HEAVENS,perceptible among its component stars. The laws by which those stellar
5519,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"aggregations are produced and governed are wrapped in obscurity, and the"
5520,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"nature of the motions of their stars, whether towards concentration or"
5521,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"diffusion, cannot at present be ascertained. If those globular clusters"
5522,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"could be observed sufficiently near, they would most probably expand"
5523,THE STARRY HEAVENS,into vast systems of suns occupying immense regions of space.
5524,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5525,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The largest and most magnificent globular cluster in the heavens is
5526,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Omega Centauri, in the Southern Hemisphere. To the naked eye it"
5527,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"resembles a round, indistinct, cometary object, about equal to a star of"
5528,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the fourth magnitude; but when observed with a powerful telescope it
5529,THE STARRY HEAVENS,appears as a globe of considerable dimensions composed of innumerable
5530,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"stars of the thirteenth and fifteenth magnitudes, all exceedingly minute"
5531,THE STARRY HEAVENS,and gathered into small knots and groups. A remarkable cluster in
5532,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Toucani is described by Sir John Herschel as 'most magnificent; very
5533,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"large; very bright, and very much compressed in the middle.' The"
5534,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"interior mass consists of closely aggregated pale rose-coloured stars,"
5535,THE STARRY HEAVENS,surrounded by others of a pure white which embrace the remainder of the
5536,THE STARRY HEAVENS,cluster. There is a fine globular cluster in Sagittarius between the
5537,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Archer's head and the bow. It was observed by Hevelius in 1665. The
5538,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"central portion is very much compressed, and consists of excessively"
5539,THE STARRY HEAVENS,minute stars enclosed by others of larger size. In Aquarius there is a
5540,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"magnificent ball of stars of a beautiful spherical form, which Sir J."
5541,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Herschel compared to a heap of fine sand. Numerous other clusters are
5542,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"profusely distributed over the heavens, occupying regions in the"
5543,THE STARRY HEAVENS,profound depths of space which can only be reached by the aid of most
5544,THE STARRY HEAVENS,powerful instruments.
5545,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5546,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The finest and most remarkable object of this class visible in the
5547,THE STARRY HEAVENS,northern heavens is the Great Cluster which lies between Eta and Zeta
5548,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Herculis. It was discovered by Halley in 1714, who writes: 'This is but"
5549,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"a little patch, but it shows itself to the naked eye when the sky is"
5550,THE STARRY HEAVENS,serene and the moon absent.' When observed with a powerful telescope its
5551,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"magnificence at once becomes apparent to the beholder. 'Perhaps,' says"
5552,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Dr. Nichol, 'no one ever saw it for the first time through a telescope"
5553,THE STARRY HEAVENS,without uttering a shout of wonder.' At its circumference the stars are
5554,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"rather scattered, but towards the centre they appear so closely"
5555,THE STARRY HEAVENS,aggregated that their combined effulgence forms a perfect blaze of
5556,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"light. Sir William Herschel estimated that there are 14,000 stars in the"
5557,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"cluster, each a magnificent world but unaccompanied by any planetary"
5558,THE STARRY HEAVENS,attendants.
5559,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5560,THE STARRY HEAVENS,[Illustration: CLUSTER IN HERCULES]
5561,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5562,THE STARRY HEAVENS,As a result of more recent investigations this number has been
5563,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"considerably reduced, and it is now generally believed that about 4,000"
5564,THE STARRY HEAVENS,stars enter into the formation of the cluster. As its distance from the
5565,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Earth is unknown, it follows that there must be some uncertainty"
5566,THE STARRY HEAVENS,attached to any conclusions that may be arrived at with regard to this
5567,THE STARRY HEAVENS,superb object. Miss Agnes Clerke estimates the number of the constituent
5568,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"stars at 4,000, and in support of her conclusion this talented lady"
5569,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"writes as follows: 'The apparent diameter of this object, including most"
5570,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"of the ""scattered stars in streaky masses and lines"" which form a sort"
5571,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"of ""glory"" round it, is 8´; that of its truly spherical portion may be"
5572,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"put at 5´. Now, a globe subtending an angle of 5´ must have (because the"
5573,THE STARRY HEAVENS,sine of that angle is to radius nearly as to 1 : 687) a real diameter
5574,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"1/687 of its distance from the eye, which, if we assume to be such as"
5575,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"would correspond to a parallax of 1/20 of a second, we find that the"
5576,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"cluster, outliers apart, measures 558,000 millions of miles across."
5577,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Light, in other words, occupies thirty-six days in traversing it, but"
5578,THE STARRY HEAVENS,sixty-five years in journeying thence hither. Its components may be
5579,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"regarded, on an average, as of the twelfth magnitude; for, although the"
5580,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"divergent stars rank much higher in the scale of brightness, the central"
5581,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"ones, there is reason to believe, are notably fainter. The sum total of"
5582,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"their light, if concentrated into one stellar point, would at any rate"
5583,THE STARRY HEAVENS,very little (if at all) exceed that of a third-magnitude star. And one
5584,THE STARRY HEAVENS,star of the third is equivalent to just four thousand stars of the
5585,THE STARRY HEAVENS,twelfth magnitude. Hence we arrive at the conclusion that the stars in
5586,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the Hercules Cluster number much more nearly four than fourteen
5587,THE STARRY HEAVENS,thousand.'
5588,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5589,THE STARRY HEAVENS,For what purpose do those thousands of clustering orbs shine? Who can
5590,THE STARRY HEAVENS,tell? Night is unknown in the regions illumined by their brilliant
5591,THE STARRY HEAVENS,radiance. This stupendous aggregation of suns testifies to the
5592,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"magnificence of the starry heavens, and to the omnipotence of the"
5593,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Creator.
5594,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5595,THE STARRY HEAVENS,GALAXIES.--These consist of vast aggregations of stars which form
5596,THE STARRY HEAVENS,separate 'island universes' floating in the depths of space; they are
5597,THE STARRY HEAVENS,believed to equal in magnitude and magnificence the Milky Way--the
5598,THE STARRY HEAVENS,galaxy to which our system belongs.
5599,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5600,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"NEBULÆ.--We now reach the last, and what are believed to be the most"
5601,THE STARRY HEAVENS,distant of the known contents of the heavens. They are all exceedingly
5602,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"remote, devoid of any perceptible motion, faintly luminous, and, with"
5603,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the exception of two of their number, invisible to the naked eye. Halley"
5604,THE STARRY HEAVENS,was the first astronomer who paid any attention to those objects. In
5605,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"1716 he enumerated six of them, but of this number only two can, in a"
5606,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"strict sense, be regarded as nebulæ, the others since then have been"
5607,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"resolved into magnificent star clusters. In 1784, Messier catalogued 103"
5608,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"nebulæ, and the Herschels--father and son--in their survey of the"
5609,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"stellar regions, discovered 4,000 of those objects. There are now 8,000"
5610,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"known nebulæ in the heavens, but the majority of them are not of much"
5611,THE STARRY HEAVENS,interest to astronomers. Prior to the invention of the spectroscope it
5612,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"was believed that all nebulæ were irresolvable star clusters, but the"
5613,THE STARRY HEAVENS,analysis of their light by this instrument indicated that their
5614,THE STARRY HEAVENS,composition was not stellar but gaseous. Their spectra consist of a few
5615,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"bright lines revealing the presence of hydrogen, nitrogen, and other"
5616,THE STARRY HEAVENS,gaseous elements.
5617,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5618,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Much that is mysterious and uncertain is associated with those objects
5619,THE STARRY HEAVENS,which appear to lie far beyond the limits of our sidereal system. It is
5620,THE STARRY HEAVENS,now generally believed that they exhibit the earliest stage in the
5621,THE STARRY HEAVENS,formation of stars and planets--inchoate worlds in process of slow
5622,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"evolution, which will eventually condense into systems of suns, and"
5623,THE STARRY HEAVENS,planetary worlds.
5624,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5625,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Nebulæ present every variety of form. Some are annular, elliptic,"
5626,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"circular, and spiral; others are fan-shaped, cylindrical, and irregular,"
5627,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"with tufted appendages, rays, and filaments. A fancied resemblance to"
5628,THE STARRY HEAVENS,different animated creatures has been observed in some. In Taurus there
5629,THE STARRY HEAVENS,is a nebula called the 'Crab' on account of its likeness to the
5630,THE STARRY HEAVENS,crustacean; another is called the 'Owl Nebula' from its resemblance to
5631,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the face of that bird. The Orion Nebula suggests the opened jaws of a
5632,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"fish or sea monster, hence called the Fish-Mouth Nebula. There is a"
5633,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Horse-Shoe Nebula, a Dumb-Bell Nebula, and many others of various shapes"
5634,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"and forms. They are classified as follows: (1) Annular Nebulæ, (2)"
5635,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Elliptic Nebulæ, (3) Spiral Nebulæ, (4) Planetary Nebulæ, (5) Nebulous"
5636,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Stars, (6) Large Irregular Nebulæ."
5637,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5638,THE STARRY HEAVENS,ANNULAR NEBULÆ.--These resemble in appearance an oval-shaped luminous
5639,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"ring; they are comparatively few in number, and not more than a dozen"
5640,THE STARRY HEAVENS,have been discovered in the whole heavens. The most remarkable object of
5641,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"this class is the Ring Nebula, which is situated between the stars Beta"
5642,THE STARRY HEAVENS,and Gamma Lyræ. It is visible in a moderate-sized telescope as a
5643,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"well-defined, flat, oval ring; its central part is not quite dark but is"
5644,THE STARRY HEAVENS,occupied by a filmy haze of luminous matter which is prolonged inwards
5645,THE STARRY HEAVENS,from the margin of the ring. When examined with a high power the edges
5646,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"of the ring have a fringed appearance, and numerous glittering stellar"
5647,THE STARRY HEAVENS,points become visible both within and without its circumference. This
5648,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"nebulous ring, though a small object in the telescope, is of enormous"
5649,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"magnitude, and if it were not more distant than 61 Cygni, one of the"
5650,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"nearest of the fixed stars, its diameter would not be less than 20,000"
5651,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"millions of miles, but it has been estimated by Herschel that it is 900"
5652,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"times more remote than Sirius. How stupendous, then, must be its"
5653,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"dimensions, and how bewildering to our conception is the profound"
5654,THE STARRY HEAVENS,immensity of space in which it is located! An annular nebula similar to
5655,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"that of Lyra, but on a smaller scale, is found in Cygnus, and within it"
5656,THE STARRY HEAVENS,there can be seen a conspicuous star. Another exists in Scorpio which
5657,THE STARRY HEAVENS,contains two stars situated within the ring at diametrically opposite
5658,THE STARRY HEAVENS,points to each other.
5659,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5660,THE STARRY HEAVENS,ELLIPTICAL NEBULÆ.--The most interesting object of this class is the
5661,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Great Nebula in Andromeda, called 'the transcendentally beautiful queen"
5662,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"of the nebulæ'--an appellation which it scarcely merits. This object,"
5663,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"which is plainly visible to the naked eye, is of an oval shape, of a"
5664,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"milky white colour, and is situated near the most northern star of the"
5665,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"three which form the girdle of Andromeda. It was known to the ancients,"
5666,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"and Ali Sufi, a Persian astronomer who flourished in the tenth century,"
5667,THE STARRY HEAVENS,alludes to it; but it did not attract much attention until the
5668,THE STARRY HEAVENS,seventeenth century. Simon Marius was the first to observe this object
5669,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"with a telescope. This he did on December 15, 1612; he describes it as"
5670,THE STARRY HEAVENS,shining with a pale white light resembling in appearance the flame of a
5671,THE STARRY HEAVENS,candle when seen through a semi-transparent piece of horn. When examined
5672,THE STARRY HEAVENS,with a high magnifying power it is seen to occupy a largely extended
5673,THE STARRY HEAVENS,area measuring 4° in length and 2-1/2° in breadth. Its luminosity
5674,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"increases from the circumference to the centre, where there can be seen"
5675,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"a small nucleus with an ill-defined boundary, which has the appearance"
5676,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"of being granular, but its composition is not stellar. Two dark channels"
5677,THE STARRY HEAVENS,running almost parallel to each other and to the axis of the nebula have
5678,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"been observed by Bond; these, when prolonged, form into curves which"
5679,THE STARRY HEAVENS,terminate in two great rings. They are wide rifts which separate streams
5680,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"of nebulous matter, and are indicative that some formative processes may"
5681,THE STARRY HEAVENS,be going on within the nebula.
5682,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5683,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Astronomers have been baffled in their attempts to discover the nature
5684,THE STARRY HEAVENS,of the Andromeda Nebula. Though great telescopes have been able to
5685,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"render visible thousands of stars over and around it, yet the nebula"
5686,THE STARRY HEAVENS,itself is irresolvable and bears no trace of stellar formation;
5687,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"neither, according to Dr. Huggins, is its spectrum gaseous, a"
5688,THE STARRY HEAVENS,circumstance which deepens the mystery associated with this object. Its
5689,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"distance is unknown, and its dimensions cannot be ascertained."
5690,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5691,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Other elliptical nebulæ are found in different regions of the heavens.
5692,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"In Ursa Major there is an oval nebula resembling that of Andromeda, but"
5693,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"on a much smaller scale. It possesses a nucleus, and on the photographic"
5694,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"plate there can be detected the presence of spiral structure, indicating"
5695,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the existence of streams of nebulous matter. Adjacent to this nebula is
5696,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"another of the same class with a double nucleus, and associated with it"
5697,THE STARRY HEAVENS,is a nebulous star.
5698,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5699,THE STARRY HEAVENS,SPIRAL NEBULÆ.--The great reflector of Earl Rosse at Parsonstown was the
5700,THE STARRY HEAVENS,successful means by which nebulæ of this form were discovered. This
5701,THE STARRY HEAVENS,powerful telescope was capable of defining with greater accuracy the
5702,THE STARRY HEAVENS,structural formation of those objects than any other instrument in use.
5703,THE STARRY HEAVENS,It was ascertained that spiral coils and convoluted whorls enter into
5704,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the structure of most nebulæ, indicating a similarity in the process of"
5705,THE STARRY HEAVENS,change which may be going on in these vast accumulations of cosmical
5706,THE STARRY HEAVENS,matter. The most interesting specimen of a spiral nebula is situated in
5707,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Canes Venatici. It consists of spiral coils emanating from a centre with
5708,THE STARRY HEAVENS,a nucleus and surrounded by a narrow luminous ring. In appearance it
5709,THE STARRY HEAVENS,resembles the coiled mainspring of a watch.
5710,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5711,THE STARRY HEAVENS,PLANETARY NEBULÆ.--These have been so named on account of the
5712,THE STARRY HEAVENS,resemblance which they bear to the discs of planets. They are of uniform
5713,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"brightness, circular in shape, with sharply-defined edges, and are"
5714,THE STARRY HEAVENS,frequently of a bluish colour. They are more numerous than annular
5715,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"nebulæ; three-fourths of their number are in the Southern Hemisphere,"
5716,THE STARRY HEAVENS,and they are situated in or very near the Milky Way. Those objects were
5717,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"first described by Sir William Herschel, who was rather perplexed as to"
5718,THE STARRY HEAVENS,what was their real nature and how he should classify them. He remarked
5719,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"that they could not be planets belonging to far-off suns, nor distant"
5720,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"comets, nor distended stars. Consequently, he concluded rightly that"
5721,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"they were nebulæ. When observed with large telescopes, they lose their"
5722,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"planetary aspect, and their sharpness of outline is less apparent; their"
5723,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"discs become broken up into bright and dark portions, and in some,"
5724,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"numerous minute stars have been observed, whilst others have"
5725,THE STARRY HEAVENS,well-defined nuclei.
5726,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5727,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The most prominent nebula of this class is situated in the constellation
5728,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Ursa Major, and is called the Owl Nebula, from its fancied resemblance"
5729,THE STARRY HEAVENS,to the face of that bird. Sir John Herschel describes it as 'a most
5730,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"extraordinary object, a large, uniform nebulous disc, quite round, very"
5731,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"bright, not sharply defined, but yet very suddenly fading away to"
5732,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"darkness.' When examined in 1848 with Earl Rosse's reflector, two bright"
5733,THE STARRY HEAVENS,stars were discovered in its interior; each was in the centre of a
5734,THE STARRY HEAVENS,circular dark space surrounded by whorls of nebulous matter--hence the
5735,THE STARRY HEAVENS,origin of its name. This nebula gives a bright line spectrum indicative
5736,THE STARRY HEAVENS,of gaseous composition. It is believed to consist chiefly of hydrogen
5737,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"and other gases which form a globe of such stupendous magnitude that, if"
5738,THE STARRY HEAVENS,we surmise its distance from the earth to be sixty-five light years--an
5739,THE STARRY HEAVENS,estimate much too low--'its diameter would exceed that of the orbit of
5740,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Neptune upwards of 100 times.'[10] Within its compass the orbs of
5741,THE STARRY HEAVENS,hundreds of solar systems as large as that of ours would be able to
5742,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"perform their revolutions, having spacious intervals existing between"
5743,THE STARRY HEAVENS,each system. Another interesting planetary nebula is in the
5744,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"constellation of the Dragon, near to the pole of the ecliptic; it is"
5745,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"slightly oval, of a pale blue colour, and contains a star of the"
5746,THE STARRY HEAVENS,eleventh magnitude in its centre. It gives a gaseous spectrum. Attempts
5747,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"have been made to determine its parallax, but without success, and"
5748,THE STARRY HEAVENS,during the eighty years it has been under observation it has remained
5749,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"apparently motionless. Its light period, if estimated at 140 years,"
5750,THE STARRY HEAVENS,would indicate the existence of a globe with a diameter equal to
5751,THE STARRY HEAVENS,forty-four diameters of the orbit of the planet Neptune.[11] A nebula of
5752,THE STARRY HEAVENS,this class was discovered by Sir John Herschel in the Centaur. He
5753,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"described it as resembling Uranus, but larger; its colour was of a"
5754,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"beautiful rich blue, and its light equalled that of a star of the"
5755,THE STARRY HEAVENS,seventh magnitude.
5756,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5757,THE STARRY HEAVENS,NEBULOUS STARS.--These stars are each surrounded by a luminous haze
5758,THE STARRY HEAVENS,several minutes of arc in diameter and of a circular form. Sir William
5759,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Herschel, by his observation of those objects, arrived at the conclusion"
5760,THE STARRY HEAVENS,'that there exists in space a shining fluid of a nature totally unknown
5761,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"to us, and that the nebulosity about those stars was not of a starry"
5762,THE STARRY HEAVENS,nature.' Thirteen stars of this type have been enumerated by him and
5763,THE STARRY HEAVENS,many others have since been discovered. The 'glow' which surrounds them
5764,THE STARRY HEAVENS,has been observed in a few instances to have vanished without leaving
5765,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"any trace of nebulosity behind, but the causes which have brought about"
5766,THE STARRY HEAVENS,such a result are entirely unknown. The nature of those stars is
5767,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"involved in considerable obscurity, and one class of nebula would seem"
5768,THE STARRY HEAVENS,to merge into the other; nebulous stars with faint aureolæ do not differ
5769,THE STARRY HEAVENS,much from small nebulæ interspersed with stellar points.
5770,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5771,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"LARGE IRREGULAR NEBULÆ.--These are found in both hemispheres, and are"
5772,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"remarkable on account of the varied appearances which they present, and"
5773,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the large extent of space which many of them occupy. In some, the"
5774,THE STARRY HEAVENS,nebulous matter of which they are composed can be seen like masses of
5775,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"tufted flocculi, sometimes piled up, and at other times promiscuously"
5776,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"scattered, resembling in appearance the foam on the crested billows of a"
5777,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"surging ocean rendered suddenly motionless, or cirro-cumuli floating in"
5778,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"a tranquil sky. Islands of light with intervening dark channels,"
5779,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"promontories projecting into gulfs of deep shade, sprays of luminous"
5780,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"matter, convoluted filaments, whorls, wreaths, and spiral streams all"
5781,THE STARRY HEAVENS,enter into the structural formation of a great nebula.
5782,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5783,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"The Great Nebula in Argo, in the Southern Hemisphere, is one of the most"
5784,THE STARRY HEAVENS,remarkable objects of this class. It consists of bright irregular masses
5785,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"of luminous matter, streaks and branches, and occupies an area about"
5786,THE STARRY HEAVENS,equal to one square degree. At its eastern border is situated the
5787,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"variable star Eta Argus, which fluctuates between the first and seventh"
5788,THE STARRY HEAVENS,magnitudes in a period of about seventy years.
5789,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5790,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"A rich portion of the Galaxy lies in front of the nebula, which creates"
5791,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"an effect as if it were studded over with stars. Sir John Herschel, in"
5792,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"describing this nebula, writes as follows:--'The whole is situated in a"
5793,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"very rich and brilliant part of the Milky Way, so thickly strewed with"
5794,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"stars that, in the area occupied by the nebula, not less than 1,200 have"
5795,THE STARRY HEAVENS,been actually counted. Yet it is obvious that these have no connection
5796,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"whatever with the nebula, being, in fact, only a simple continuation"
5797,THE STARRY HEAVENS,over it of the general ground of the Galaxy. The conclusion can hardly
5798,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"be avoided that, in looking at it, we see through and beyond the Milky"
5799,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Way, far out into space, through a starless region, disconnecting it"
5800,THE STARRY HEAVENS,altogether from our system. It is not easy for language to convey a full
5801,THE STARRY HEAVENS,impression of the beauty and sublimity of the spectacle which this
5802,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"nebula offers as it enters the field of view of a telescope, fixed in"
5803,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"right ascension, by the diurnal motion, ushered in as it is by so"
5804,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"glorious and innumerable a procession of stars, to which it forms a sort"
5805,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"of climax, and in a part of the heavens otherwise full of interest.'"
5806,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Another large bright nebula (called 30 Doradus), also in the Southern"
5807,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Hemisphere, is composed of a series of loops with intricate windings"
5808,THE STARRY HEAVENS,forming a kind of open network against the background of the sky which
5809,THE STARRY HEAVENS,it adorns. Sir John Herschel describes it as one of the most
5810,THE STARRY HEAVENS,extraordinary objects in the heavens.
5811,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5812,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"The 'Crab' Nebula in Taurus, the 'Horse-Shoe' Nebula in Sobieski's"
5813,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Shield, and the 'Dumb-Bell' Nebula in Vulpecula are remarkable objects,"
5814,THE STARRY HEAVENS,but the assistance of a powerful telescope is required to bring out
5815,THE STARRY HEAVENS,their distinctive features. The 'Crab' Nebula is partially resolvable
5816,THE STARRY HEAVENS,into stars; the other two are believed to be gaseous.
5817,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5818,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The largest and most remarkable of all the nebulæ is that known as the
5819,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Great Nebula in Orion, which was discovered and delineated by Huygens in"
5820,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the middle of the seventeenth century. It is perceptible to the naked
5821,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"eye, and when viewed with a glass of low power can be seen as a circular"
5822,THE STARRY HEAVENS,luminous haze surrounding the multiple star Theta Orionis--one of the
5823,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"stars in the Giant's Sword, and which is of itself a remarkable object."
5824,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The most conspicuous part of the nebula bears a slight resemblance to
5825,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the wing of a bird; it consists of flocculent masses of nebulous matter
5826,THE STARRY HEAVENS,possessing a faint greenish tinge. Sir John Herschel compared it to a
5827,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"surface studded over with flocks of wool, or to the breaking up of a"
5828,THE STARRY HEAVENS,mackerel sky when the clouds of which it consists begin to assume a
5829,THE STARRY HEAVENS,cirrous appearance. Its brightest portion is occupied by four
5830,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"conspicuous stars, which form a trapezium; around each there is a dark"
5831,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"space free from nebulosity, a circumstance which would seem to indicate"
5832,THE STARRY HEAVENS,that the stars possess the power either of absorbing or of repelling the
5833,THE STARRY HEAVENS,nebulous matter in their immediate vicinity. When observed with a
5834,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"powerful telescope, this nebula appears to be of vast dimensions, and,"
5835,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"with its effluents, occupies an area of 4° by 5-1/2°. Irregular"
5836,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"branching masses, streams, sprays, filaments, and curved spiral wreaths"
5837,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"project outward from the parent mass, and become gradually lost in the"
5838,THE STARRY HEAVENS,surrounding space. This object remained for long a profound mystery; no
5839,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"telescope was capable of resolving it, nor was it known what this"
5840,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"'unformed fiery mist, the chaotic material of future suns,' was, until"
5841,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the spectroscope revealed that it consists of a stupendous mass of
5842,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"incandescent gases--nitrogen, hydrogen, and other elementary substances,"
5843,THE STARRY HEAVENS,occupying a region of space believed by some to equal in extent the
5844,THE STARRY HEAVENS,whole stellar system to which our Sun belongs.
5845,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5846,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"In the Southern Hemisphere, near to the pole of the equator, are two"
5847,THE STARRY HEAVENS,nebulous clouds of unequal size; the larger having an area about four
5848,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"times that of the smaller. They are known as the Magellanic Clouds,"
5849,THE STARRY HEAVENS,having been called after the navigator Magellan. Both are visible on a
5850,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"moonless night, but in bright moonlight the smaller disappears. Sir John"
5851,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Herschel, when at the Cape of Good Hope, examined those objects with his"
5852,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"powerful telescope. He described them 'as consisting of swarms of stars,"
5853,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"globular clusters, and nebulæ of various kinds, some portions of them"
5854,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"being quite irresolvable, and presenting the same milky appearance in"
5855,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the telescope that the nebulæ themselves do to the naked eye.' These are
5856,THE STARRY HEAVENS,believed to be other universes of stars sunk in the profound depths of
5857,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"space, our knowledge of their existence being dependent upon the faint"
5858,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"nebulous light which left them, perhaps, several thousand years ago."

5860,THE STARRY HEAVENS,[Illustration: GREAT NEBULA IN ORION]
5861,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5862,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The description of the various kinds of nebulæ leads us to consider what
5863,THE STARRY HEAVENS,is called the Nebular Hypothesis. That the stars and solar system had at
5864,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"some time in the past a beginning, is as much a matter of certainty as"
5865,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"that they will at some future time cease to be. Stars, like organic"
5866,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"beings, have their birth, grow and arrive at maturity, then decline into"
5867,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"a state of decrepitude, and finally die out. The duration of the life of"
5868,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"a star, which may be reckoned by millions of years, depends upon the"
5869,THE STARRY HEAVENS,length of time during which it can maintain a temperature that renders
5870,THE STARRY HEAVENS,it capable of emitting light. By the constant radiation of its heat into
5871,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"space, a condition of its constituent particles consequent upon the"
5872,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"gradual contraction of its mass will ultimately occur, which will result"
5873,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"in the exhaustion of its stores of thermal energy, the extinction of its"
5874,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"light, and the reduction of what was once a brilliant orb to the"
5875,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"condition of a mass of cold, opaque, inert matter. Inquiries as to the"
5876,THE STARRY HEAVENS,origin of the stars have led scientific men to conclude that they have
5877,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"been evolved from gaseous nebulæ, and these have therefore been regarded"
5878,THE STARRY HEAVENS,as indicating the earliest stage in the formation of suns and planets.
5879,THE STARRY HEAVENS,It is believed that the condensation of those attenuated masses of
5880,THE STARRY HEAVENS,luminous matter into stars is capable of accounting for the generation
5881,THE STARRY HEAVENS,and formation of all the shining orbs which enter into the structure of
5882,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the starry heavens. In the evolution of a 'cosmos out of a chaos' we
5883,THE STARRY HEAVENS,should expect to find stars presenting every stage of development--some
5884,THE STARRY HEAVENS,in an embryo state and others more advanced; stars in full vigour and
5885,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"activity, stars that have passed the meridian of life, and stars in a"
5886,THE STARRY HEAVENS,condition of decay and on the verge of extinction. The observations of
5887,THE STARRY HEAVENS,astronomers have led them to conclude that this condition of 'youth and
5888,THE STARRY HEAVENS,age' exists among the stellar multitude; but the characteristics by
5889,THE STARRY HEAVENS,which it is distinguished are neither very obvious nor reliable.
5890,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5891,THE STARRY HEAVENS,The nebular theory is incapable of proof or demonstration; but modern
5892,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"discoveries tend to support the accuracy of its conclusions, and its"
5893,THE STARRY HEAVENS,principles have now been adopted by the majority of philosophic
5894,THE STARRY HEAVENS,thinkers. The physical changes which are going on in the nebulæ towards
5895,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"stellar evolution, or in fully formed stars towards dissolution, are so"
5896,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"slow that the life of an individual, or even the historical records of"
5897,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the past, are incapable of furnishing any evidence of alteration in"
5898,THE STARRY HEAVENS,their condition. A period of time infinitely greater than what has
5899,THE STARRY HEAVENS,elapsed since the birth of science must pass before anything can be
5900,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"known of the life history of the stars; indeed, the allotted span of"
5901,THE STARRY HEAVENS,man's existence on this planet may have terminated ere the evolution of
5902,THE STARRY HEAVENS,a large nebula into a star cluster can have taken place.
5903,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5904,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"The nebular hypothesis was first propounded by Kant, who suggested that"
5905,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the sun and planets originated from a vast and diffused mass of cosmical
5906,THE STARRY HEAVENS,matter. This theory was afterwards supported by Herschel and by the
5907,THE STARRY HEAVENS,great French astronomer Laplace. As a result of close and continued
5908,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"observation of the different classes of nebulæ, Herschel arrived at the"
5909,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"conclusion that there exists in space a widely diffused 'shining fluid,'"
5910,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"of a nature totally unknown to us, and that the nebulosity which he"
5911,THE STARRY HEAVENS,perceived to surround some stars was not of a starry nature. He further
5912,THE STARRY HEAVENS,adds that this self-luminous matter 'seemed more fit to produce a star
5913,THE STARRY HEAVENS,by its condensation than to depend on the star for its existence.' His
5914,THE STARRY HEAVENS,sagacious conclusion with regard to the non-stellar nature of this
5915,THE STARRY HEAVENS,nebulous matter was afterwards confirmed by the spectroscope; for at
5916,THE STARRY HEAVENS,that time it was believed that even the faintest nebulæ were
5917,THE STARRY HEAVENS,irresolvable star clusters.
5918,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5919,THE STARRY HEAVENS,In 1811 Herschel read a paper before the Royal Society in which he
5920,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"propounded his famous nebular hypothesis, and stated his reasons for"
5921,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"believing that nebulæ, by their gradual condensation, were transformed"
5922,THE STARRY HEAVENS,into stars. Having assumed that there exists a highly attenuated
5923,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"self-luminous substance diffused over vast regions of space, he"
5924,THE STARRY HEAVENS,endeavoured to show that by the law of attraction its particles would
5925,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"have a tendency to coalesce and form aggregations of nebulous matter,"
5926,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"and that each of these, by the continued action of the same force, would"
5927,THE STARRY HEAVENS,gradually condense and ultimately acquire the consistence of a star. In
5928,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the case of large irregular nebulæ, numerous centres of attraction would"
5929,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"originate in the mass, round which the nebulous particles of matter"
5930,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"would arrange themselves; each nucleus, when condensation had been"
5931,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"completed, would become a star, and the entire nebula would in this"
5932,THE STARRY HEAVENS,manner be transformed into a cluster of stars. Herschel believed that he
5933,THE STARRY HEAVENS,could trace the different stages of nebular condensation which result in
5934,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the evolution of a star. In large, faintly luminous nebulæ the process"
5935,THE STARRY HEAVENS,of condensation had only commenced; in others that were smaller and
5936,THE STARRY HEAVENS,brighter it was in a more advanced stage; in those that contained nuclei
5937,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"there was evidence of nascent stars; and, finally, there could be seen"
5938,THE STARRY HEAVENS,in some nebulæ minute stellar points--new-born suns--interspersed among
5939,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the haze of the transforming mass. By this theory Herschel was able to
5940,THE STARRY HEAVENS,account for the phenomena associated with nebulous stars and the
5941,THE STARRY HEAVENS,supposed changes which were observed in some nebulæ. The nebular
5942,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"hypothesis as described by Herschel was not received with much favour,"
5943,THE STARRY HEAVENS,nor did it unsettle much the belief that all nebulæ were vast stellar
5944,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"aggregations, and that their cloudy luminosity was a consequence of the"
5945,THE STARRY HEAVENS,inadequacy of telescopic power to resolve them into their component
5946,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"stars. Laplace, who was highly gifted as a geometrician, demonstrated"
5947,THE STARRY HEAVENS,how the solar system could have been evolved in accordance with
5948,THE STARRY HEAVENS,dynamical principles from a slowly rotating and slowly contracting
5949,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"spheroidal nebula. The rotatory motion of a nebula, in obedience to a"
5950,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"well-known mechanical law, increases as its density becomes greater, and"
5951,THE STARRY HEAVENS,this goes on until the tangential force at the equator overcomes the
5952,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"gravitational attraction at its centre. When this occurs, a revolving"
5953,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"ring of nebulous matter is thrown off from the parent mass, and by this"
5954,THE STARRY HEAVENS,means equilibrium is restored between the two forces. As the rotatory
5955,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"velocity of the nebula continues to increase with its contraction,"
5956,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"another ring is cast off, and in this manner a succession of revolving"
5957,THE STARRY HEAVENS,rings may be detached from the condensing spheroid; each newly-formed
5958,THE STARRY HEAVENS,ring being nearer to the centre of the contracting mass and revolving in
5959,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"a shorter period than its predecessor. In the evolution of our system,"
5960,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the central mass of the nebula became the Sun and each of the revolving
5961,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"rings, by their condensation into one mass, formed a planet. In a"
5962,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"similar manner, though on a diminished scale, the elementary planets,"
5963,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"whilst in a nebulous state, parted with annular portions of their"
5964,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"substance, out of which were evolved their systems of satellites. This"
5965,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"theory furnished a plausible reason, which was capable of explaining how"
5966,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the orbs which constitute the solar system came into existence, and,"
5967,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"though hypothetical, yet the manner in which it accounted for the"
5968,THE STARRY HEAVENS,orderly and symmetrical genesis of the system rendered it attractive and
5969,THE STARRY HEAVENS,fascinating to scientific minds.
5970,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5971,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"The evidence in support of the nebulous origin of the solar system, if"
5972,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"not conclusive, is of much weight and importance. The remarkable harmony"
5973,THE STARRY HEAVENS,with which the orbs of the system perform their motions is strongly
5974,THE STARRY HEAVENS,indicative of their common origin and that their evolution occurred in
5975,THE STARRY HEAVENS,subordination to the law of universal gravitation. The following are the
5976,THE STARRY HEAVENS,characteristic points in favour of this theory:--
5977,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5978,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"1. All the planets revolve round the Sun in the same direction, and they"
5979,THE STARRY HEAVENS,all occupy nearly the same plane.
5980,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5981,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"2. Their satellites, with the exception of those of Uranus and Neptune,"
5982,THE STARRY HEAVENS,perform their revolutions in obedience to the same law.
5983,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5984,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"3. The rotation on their axes of the Sun, planets, and satellites is in"
5985,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the same direction as their orbital motion.
5986,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
5987,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter there revolves a remarkable group
5988,THE STARRY HEAVENS,of small planets or planetoids. On account of the absence of a planet in
5989,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"this region, where, according to the laws of planetary distances, one"
5990,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"ought to be found, the existence of those small bodies was suspected for"
5991,THE STARRY HEAVENS,some years prior to their discovery. The first was detected by Piazzi at
5992,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Palermo in 1801; two others were discovered by Olbers in 1802 and 1807,"
5993,THE STARRY HEAVENS,and one by Harding in 1804. For some time it was believed that no more
5994,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"planetoids existed, but in 1845 a fifth was detected by Hencke, and from"
5995,THE STARRY HEAVENS,that year until now upwards of 300 of those small bodies have been
5996,THE STARRY HEAVENS,discovered. Their magnitudes are of varied extent; the diameter of the
5997,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"largest is believed not to exceed 450 miles, and that of the smaller"
5998,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"ones from twenty to thirty miles. It was surmised at one time, when only"
5999,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"a few of those bodies were known, that they were the fragments of a"
6000,THE STARRY HEAVENS,planet which met with some terrible catastrophe; but since the discovery
6001,THE STARRY HEAVENS,of so many other planetoids this theory cannot be maintained. According
6002,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"to the nebular hypothesis, these bodies are the consolidated portions of"
6003,THE STARRY HEAVENS,a nebulous ring which remained separate instead of having coalesced into
6004,THE STARRY HEAVENS,one mass so as to form a planet. The uniform condensation of the ring
6005,THE STARRY HEAVENS,would result in the formation of a multitude of small planets similar to
6006,THE STARRY HEAVENS,what are found between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. In Saturn's ring
6007,THE STARRY HEAVENS,we have a remarkable instance of annular consolidation in which the form
6008,THE STARRY HEAVENS,of the ring has been preserved. The ring is believed to consist of
6009,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"myriads of minute bodies, each of which travels in an orbit of its own"
6010,THE STARRY HEAVENS,as it pursues its path round the planet; the close approximation and
6011,THE STARRY HEAVENS,exceeding minuteness of those moving objects create the appearance of a
6012,THE STARRY HEAVENS,solid continuous ring.
6013,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
6014,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Though, by means of the nebular hypothesis, it is impossible to explain"
6015,THE STARRY HEAVENS,all the phenomena associated with the motions of the orbs which enter
6016,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"into the structure of the solar system, yet this does not detract much"
6017,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"from the merits of the theory, the fundamental principles of which are"
6018,THE STARRY HEAVENS,based upon the evolution of the solar system from a rotating nebula.
6019,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"The retrograde motions of the satellites of Uranus and Neptune, the"
6020,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"velocity of the inner Martian moon, and other abnormalities in the"
6021,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"system, have not as yet been explained, but doubtless there are reasons"
6022,THE STARRY HEAVENS,by which those peculiarities can be accounted for if they were only
6023,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"known, '_felix qui potuit cognoscere causas omnium rerum_.'"
6024,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
6025,THE STARRY HEAVENS,No attempt has been made to supplant the nebular hypothesis by any other
6026,THE STARRY HEAVENS,theory of cosmical evolution. Modern investigations and discoveries have
6027,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"strengthened its position, and at present it is the only means by which"
6028,THE STARRY HEAVENS,we can account for the existence of the visible material universe by
6029,THE STARRY HEAVENS,which we are surrounded.
6030,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
6031,THE STARRY HEAVENS,In the days when Milton lived--three hundred years ago--the nocturnal
6032,THE STARRY HEAVENS,heavens presented the same appearance to an observer as they do at the
6033,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"present time. The stars pursued their identical paths, and looked down"
6034,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"upon the Earth with the same aspect of serene tranquillity, regardless"
6035,THE STARRY HEAVENS,of the vicissitudes which affect the inhabitants of this terrestrial
6036,THE STARRY HEAVENS,sphere. The constellations that adorn the celestial vault duly appeared
6037,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"in their seasons,"
6038,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
6039,THE STARRY HEAVENS,and in the ascending scale
6040,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Of Heaven the stars that usher evening rose.--iv. 354-55.
6041,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
6042,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"The winter glories of Orion, the scintillating brilliancy of Sirius, and"
6043,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the spangled firmament, bearing no impress of change or variation which"
6044,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"would lead one to conclude that the heavens were other than eternal,"
6045,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"attracted then, as now, the admiration of beholders."
6046,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
6047,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Apart from the orbs which constitute the solar system, little was known"
6048,THE STARRY HEAVENS,of the sidereal heavens beyond the visual effect created by the
6049,THE STARRY HEAVENS,nocturnal aspect of the star-lit sky. Though ancient philosophers
6050,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"hazarded an opinion that the stars were suns, they received but scant"
6051,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"attention from early astronomers, by whom they were merely regarded as"
6052,THE STARRY HEAVENS,convenient fixed points which enabled them to determine with greater
6053,THE STARRY HEAVENS,accuracy the positions of the planets and the paths traced out by them
6054,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"in the heavens. The Ptolemaists, who believed in the diurnal revolution"
6055,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"of the spheres, assigned to the stars a very subordinate place in their"
6056,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"cosmology, which was the one adopted by Milton; and although Copernicus"
6057,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"relegated them to their proper location in space, yet he had no clear"
6058,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"conception of a universe of stars. Tycho Brahé, who declined to accept"
6059,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the Copernican theory, disbelieved that the stars were suns, and"
6060,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Galileo, who discovered the stellar nature of the Milky Way, remarked"
6061,THE STARRY HEAVENS,that the stars were not illumined by the Sun's rays in the same manner
6062,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"that the planets are, but expressed no opinion with regard to their"
6063,THE STARRY HEAVENS,physical constitution. It is only within the past fifty years that proof
6064,THE STARRY HEAVENS,has been obtained of the real nature of the stars. By the spectroscopic
6065,THE STARRY HEAVENS,analysis of their light it has been ascertained that the elements of
6066,THE STARRY HEAVENS,matter which enter into their composition exist in a condition similar
6067,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"to what is found in the Sun. The stars are therefore suns, many of them"
6068,THE STARRY HEAVENS,surpassing in magnitude and brilliancy the great luminary of our
6069,THE STARRY HEAVENS,system.
6070,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
6071,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Though Milton makes frequent allusion to the magnificence of the starry
6072,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"heavens, we have no evidence that he regarded the stars as suns, nor"
6073,THE STARRY HEAVENS,does he refer to them as such in any part of his poem.[12] What
6074,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"impressed him most was their number and brilliancy, to which reference"
6075,THE STARRY HEAVENS,is made in the following passages:
6076,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
6077,THE STARRY HEAVENS,About him all the Sanctities of Heaven
6078,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Stood thick as stars.--iii. 60-61.

6089,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
6090,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Milton describes the number of the fallen angels as
6091,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
6092,THE STARRY HEAVENS,an host
6093,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Innumerable as the stars of night.--v. 744-45,"
6094,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
6095,THE STARRY HEAVENS,and the attention of Satan is directed by the archangel Uriel to the
6096,THE STARRY HEAVENS,multitude of stars formed from the chaotic elements of matter:
6097,THE STARRY HEAVENS,

6104,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Though Milton was doubtless familiar with the leading orbs of the
6105,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"firmament and knew their names, and the constellations in which they are"
6106,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"situated, yet he makes no direct allusion to any of them in his poem."
6107,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Neither Arcturus, which is mentioned in the Book of Job, nor Sirius,"
6108,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"which attracted the attention of Homer, who compared the brightness of"
6109,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Achilles' armour to the dazzling brilliancy of the dog-star, finds a"
6110,THE STARRY HEAVENS,place in 'Paradise Lost.' And yet the superior magnitude and brilliancy
6111,THE STARRY HEAVENS,of some stars when compared with those of others did not escape Milton's
6112,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"observation when, in describing the lofty eminence of Satan in heaven,"
6113,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"prior to his fall, he represents him as"
6114,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
6115,THE STARRY HEAVENS,brighter once amidst the host
6116,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Of angels than that star the stars among.--vii. 132-33.
6117,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
6118,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"There is but one star to which Milton makes individual allusion, and,"
6119,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"though not of any conspicuous brilliancy, yet it is one of much"
6120,THE STARRY HEAVENS,importance to astronomers--
6121,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
6122,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the fleecy star that bears
6123,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Andromeda far off Atlantic seas
6124,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Beyond the horizon.--iii. 558-60.
6125,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
6126,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"This is Alpha Arietis, the first point in the constellation of that"
6127,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"name, which signifies the Ram, and from which the right ascensions of"
6128,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the stars are measured on the celestial sphere. In the time of
6129,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Hipparchus the ecliptic intersected the celestial equator in Aries,"
6130,THE STARRY HEAVENS,which indicated the commencement of the astronomical year and the
6131,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"occurrence of the vernal equinox; but, owing to precession, this point"
6132,THE STARRY HEAVENS,is now 30° westward of Aries and in the constellation Pisces. The star
6133,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"was called Hamal by the Arabs, signifying a sheep, and the animal is"
6134,THE STARRY HEAVENS,represented as looking backwards. Manilius writes:--
6135,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
6136,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"First Aries, glorious in his golden wool,"
6137,THE STARRY HEAVENS,Looks back and wonders at the mighty Bull.
6138,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
6139,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Aries is associated with the legend of the Golden Fleece, in quest of"
6140,THE STARRY HEAVENS,which Jason and his valiant crew sailed in the ship 'Argo.' In the
6141,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"autumn, Andromeda is situated above Aries, and would seem to be borne by"
6142,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"the latter, which accounts for Milton's description of the relative"
6143,THE STARRY HEAVENS,positions of those two constellations.
6144,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
6145,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Milton alludes to the starry sphere in several passages in his poem, and"
6146,THE STARRY HEAVENS,also mentions the starry pole above which he soared in imagination up to
6147,THE STARRY HEAVENS,the Empyrean or Heaven of Heavens. His contemplation of the Galaxy must
6148,THE STARRY HEAVENS,have impressed his mind with the magnitude and extent of the sidereal
6149,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"universe, for he was aware that this luminous zone which encircles the"
6150,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"heavens consists of myriads of stars, so remote as to be incapable of"
6151,THE STARRY HEAVENS,definition by unaided vision. Milton's description of this vast
6152,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"assemblage of stars is worthy of its magnificence, and the purpose with"
6153,THE STARRY HEAVENS,which he poetically associates this glorified highway testifies to the
6154,THE STARRY HEAVENS,sublimity of his thoughts and to the originality of his genius. In those
6155,THE STARRY HEAVENS,parts of his poem in which he describes the glories of the celestial
6156,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"regions, and instances the beautiful phenomena associated with the"
6157,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"individual orbs of the firmament, we are able to perceive with what"
6158,THE STARRY HEAVENS,exquisite delight he beheld them all.
6159,THE STARRY HEAVENS,
6160,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"The invention of the telescope, and the important discoveries made by"
6161,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"Kepler, Galileo, and Newton in the seventeenth century, were the means"
6162,THE STARRY HEAVENS,of effecting a rapid advance in the science of astronomy; but that
6163,THE STARRY HEAVENS,branch of it known as sidereal astronomy was not then in existence. The
6164,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"star depths, owing to inadequate telescopic power, remained unexplored,"
6165,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"and the secrets associated with those distant regions were inviolable,"
6166,THE STARRY HEAVENS,and lay beyond the reach of human knowledge. The physical constitution
6167,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"of the stars was unknown, nor was it ascertained with any degree of"
6168,THE STARRY HEAVENS,certainty that they were suns. The knowledge possessed by astronomers in
6169,THE STARRY HEAVENS,those days was but meagre compared with what is now known of the
6170,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"sidereal heavens. Milton's astronomical knowledge, we find, was"
6171,THE STARRY HEAVENS,"commensurate with what was known of the stellar universe, and this he"
6172,THE STARRY HEAVENS,has conspicuously displayed in his poem.

6183,THE SUN,
6184,THE SUN,"The surpassing splendour of the Sun, as compared with that of any of the"
6185,THE SUN,"other orbs of the firmament, is not more impressive than his stupendous"
6186,THE SUN,"magnitude, and the important functions which it is his prerogative to"
6187,THE SUN,fulfil. Situated at the centre of our system--of which he may be
6188,THE SUN,regarded as 'both eye and soul'--the orb has a diameter approaching
6189,THE SUN,"1,000,000 miles, and a mass 750 times greater than that of all the"
6190,THE SUN,"planets combined. These, by his attractive power, he retains in their"
6191,THE SUN,"several paths and orbits, and even far distant Neptune acknowledges his"
6192,THE SUN,potent sway. With prodigal liberality he dispenses his vast stores of
6193,THE SUN,"light and heat, which illumine and vivify the worlds circling around"
6194,THE SUN,"him, and upon the constant supply of which all animated beings depend"
6195,THE SUN,"for their existence. Deprived of the light of the Sun, this world would"
6196,THE SUN,"be enveloped in perpetual darkness, and we should all miserably perish."
6197,THE SUN,
6198,THE SUN,"The Sun is distant from the Earth about 93,000,000 miles. His diameter"
6199,THE SUN,"is 867,000 miles, or nearly four times the extent of the radius of the"
6200,THE SUN,"Moon's orbit. The mass of the orb exceeds that of the Earth 330,000"
6201,THE SUN,"times, and in volume 1,305,000 times. The Sun is a sphere, and rotates"
6202,THE SUN,on his axis from west to east in 25 days 8 hours. The velocity of a
6203,THE SUN,"point at the solar equator is 4,407 miles an hour. The density of the"
6204,THE SUN,"Sun is only one-fourth that of the Earth, or, in other words, bulk for"
6205,THE SUN,"bulk, the Earth is four times heavier than the Sun. The force of gravity"
6206,THE SUN,at the Sun's surface is twenty-seven times greater than it is on the
6207,THE SUN,Earth; it would therefore be impossible for beings constituted as we are
6208,THE SUN,to exist on the solar surface.
6209,THE SUN,
6210,THE SUN,The dazzling luminous envelope which indicates to the naked eye the
6211,THE SUN,boundary of the solar disc is called the PHOTOSPHERE. It is most
6212,THE SUN,"brilliant at the centre of the Sun, and diminishes in brightness towards"
6213,THE SUN,"the circumference, where its luminosity is but one-fourth that of the"
6214,THE SUN,central portion of the disc. The photosphere consists of gaseous vapours
6215,THE SUN,"or clouds, of irregular form and size, separated by less brilliant"
6216,THE SUN,"interstices, and glowing white with the heat derived from the interior"
6217,THE SUN,of the Sun. In the telescope the photosphere is not of uniform
6218,THE SUN,"brilliancy, but presents a mottled or granular appearance, an effect"
6219,THE SUN,created by the intermixture of spaces of unequal brightness. Small
6220,THE SUN,"nodules of intense brilliance, resembling 'rice-grains,' but which,"
6221,THE SUN,"according to Nasmyth, are of a willow-leaf shape with pointed"
6222,THE SUN,"extremities, which form a network over portions of the photosphere, are"
6223,THE SUN,sprinkled profusely over a more faintly luminous background. These
6224,THE SUN,"'grains' consist of irregular rounded masses, having an area of several"
6225,THE SUN,hundred miles. By the application of a high magnifying power they can be
6226,THE SUN,resolved into 'granules'--minute luminous dots which constitute
6227,THE SUN,one-fifth of the Sun's surface and emit three-fourths of the light. This
6228,THE SUN,granulation is not uniform over the surface of the photosphere; in some
6229,THE SUN,"parts it is indistinct, and appears to be replaced by interlacing"
6230,THE SUN,"filamentous bands, which are most apparent in the penumbræ of the spots"
6231,THE SUN,and around the spots themselves. The 'granules' are the tops of
6232,THE SUN,ascending masses of intensely luminous vapour; the comparatively dark
6233,THE SUN,"'pores' consist of similar descending masses, which, having radiated"
6234,THE SUN,"their energy, are returning to be again heated underneath the surface of"
6235,THE SUN,the photosphere.
6236,THE SUN,
6237,THE SUN,In certain regions of the photosphere several dark patches are usually
6238,THE SUN,"visible, which are called 'sun-spots.' At occasional times they are"
6239,THE SUN,almost entirely absent from the solar disc. It has been observed that
6240,THE SUN,they occupy a zone extending from 10° to 35° north and south of the
6241,THE SUN,"solar equator, but are not found in the equatorial and polar regions of"
6242,THE SUN,the Sun. A sun-spot is usually described as consisting of an irregular
6243,THE SUN,"dark central portion, called the _umbra_; surrounding it is an edging or"
6244,THE SUN,"fringe less dark, consisting of filaments radiating inwards called the"
6245,THE SUN,_penumbra_. Within the umbra there is sometimes seen a still darker
6246,THE SUN,"spot, called the _nucleus_. The umbra is generally uniformly dark, but"
6247,THE SUN,at times filmy luminous clouds have been observed floating over it. The
6248,THE SUN,nucleus is believed to be the orifice of a tubular depression in the
6249,THE SUN,"floor of the umbra, prolonged downwards to an unknown depth. The"
6250,THE SUN,"penumbra is brightest at its inner edge, where the filaments present a"
6251,THE SUN,marked contrast when compared with the dark cavity of the umbra which
6252,THE SUN,they surround and overhang. Sometimes lengthened processes unite with
6253,THE SUN,those of the opposite side and form bands and 'bridges' across the
6254,THE SUN,"umbra. The darkest portion of the penumbra is its external edge, which"
6255,THE SUN,stands out conspicuously against the adjoining bright surface of the
6256,THE SUN,Sun. One penumbra will sometimes enclose several umbræ whilst the nuclei
6257,THE SUN,may be entirely wanting.

6262,THE SUN,
6263,THE SUN,Sun-spots usually appear in groups; large isolated spots are of rare
6264,THE SUN,"occurrence, and are generally accompanied by several smaller ones of"
6265,THE SUN,less perfect formation. The exact moment of the origin of a sun-spot
6266,THE SUN,"cannot be ascertained, because it arises from an imperceptible point; it"
6267,THE SUN,"grows very rapidly, and often attains its full size in a day."
6268,THE SUN,
6269,THE SUN,Prior to its appearance there is an unusual disturbance of the solar
6270,THE SUN,"surface over the site of the spot: luminous ridges, called _faculæ_, and"
6271,THE SUN,"dark 'pores' become conspicuous, between which greyish patches appear,"
6272,THE SUN,that seem to lie underneath a thin layer of the photosphere; this is
6273,THE SUN,rapidly dispelled and a fully formed spot comes into view. When a
6274,THE SUN,"sun-spot has completed its period of existence, the photospheric matter"
6275,THE SUN,"overwhelms the penumbra, and rushes into the umbra, which it"
6276,THE SUN,"obliterates, causing the spot to disappear. The duration of sun-spots is"
6277,THE SUN,"subject to considerable variation; some last for weeks or months, and"
6278,THE SUN,others for a few days or hours. A spot when once fully formed maintains
6279,THE SUN,"its shape, which is usually rounded, until the period of its breaking"
6280,THE SUN,up. Spots of long duration rotate with the Sun. Those which become
6281,THE SUN,visible at the edge of the Sun's limb have been observed to travel
6282,THE SUN,"across his disc in less than a fortnight, disappearing at the margin of"
6283,THE SUN,"the opposite limb; afterwards, if sufficiently long-lived, they have"
6284,THE SUN,reappeared in twelve or thirteen days on the surface of the orb where
6285,THE SUN,first observed. It was by observation of the spots that the period of
6286,THE SUN,the axial rotation of the Sun became known.
6287,THE SUN,
6288,THE SUN,Sun-spots vary very much in size--some are only a few hundred miles in
6289,THE SUN,"width, whilst others have a diameter of 40,000 or 50,000 miles or"
6290,THE SUN,"upwards. In some instances the umbra alone has a breadth of 20,000 or"
6291,THE SUN,"30,000 miles--three times the extent of the diameter of the Earth. Spots"
6292,THE SUN,of this size are visible to the naked eye when the Sun is partially
6293,THE SUN,"obscured by fog, or when his brilliancy is diminished by vapours near"
6294,THE SUN,the horizon. A year seldom passes without the occurrence of several of
6295,THE SUN,such spots being recorded. The largest sun-spot ever observed had a
6296,THE SUN,"diameter of about 150,000 miles. A group of spots, including their"
6297,THE SUN,"penumbræ, will occupy an area of many millions of square miles."
6298,THE SUN,
6299,THE SUN,By long observation it has been ascertained that sun-spots increase and
6300,THE SUN,"diminish in number with periodical regularity, and that a maximum"
6301,THE SUN,sun-spot period occurs at the end of each eleven years. When spots are
6302,THE SUN,numerous on the Sun's disc there is great disturbance of the solar
6303,THE SUN,"surface, accompanied by fierce rushes of intensely heated gases. This"
6304,THE SUN,solar activity is known to influence terrestrial magnetism by causing a
6305,THE SUN,"marked oscillation of the magnetic needle, and giving rise to so-called"
6306,THE SUN,"'magnetic storms,' accompanied by magnificent displays of auroræ, with"
6307,THE SUN,variations in electrical earth-currents. It would therefore appear that
6308,THE SUN,"sun-spots have a pronounced effect upon magnetic terrestrial phenomena,"
6309,THE SUN,but how this is produced remains unknown.
6310,THE SUN,
6311,THE SUN,"Besides sun-spots, there are seen on the solar disc bright flocculent"
6312,THE SUN,streaks or ridges of luminous matter called _faculæ_; they are found
6313,THE SUN,"over the whole surface of the Sun, but are most numerous near the limb"
6314,THE SUN,and in the immediate vicinity of the spots. They have been compared to
6315,THE SUN,"immense waves--vast upheavals of photospheric matter, indicative of"
6316,THE SUN,"enormous pressure, and often extending in length for many thousands of"
6317,THE SUN,miles.
6318,THE SUN,
6319,THE SUN,Nearly all observers have arrived at the conclusion that sun-spots are
6320,THE SUN,"depressions or cavities in the photosphere, but considerable difference"
6321,THE SUN,of opinion exists as to how they are formed. The most commonly accepted
6322,THE SUN,theory is that they are caused by the pressure of descending masses of
6323,THE SUN,"vapour having a reduced temperature, which absorb the light and prevent"
6324,THE SUN,it reaching us. Our knowledge of the Sun is insufficient to admit of any
6325,THE SUN,accurate conclusion on this point; though we are able to perceive that
6326,THE SUN,the surface of the orb is in a state of violent agitation and perpetual
6327,THE SUN,"change, yet his great distance and intense luminosity prevent our"
6328,THE SUN,capability of perceiving the ultimate minuter details which go to form
6329,THE SUN,the _texture_ of the solar surface. 'Bearing in mind that a second of
6330,THE SUN,"arc on the Sun represents 455 miles, it follows that an object 150 miles"
6331,THE SUN,in diameter is about the _minimum visible_ even as a mere mathematical
6332,THE SUN,"point, and that anything that is sufficiently large to give the"
6333,THE SUN,slightest impression of shape and extension of surface must have an
6334,THE SUN,area of at least a quarter of a million square miles; ordinarily
6335,THE SUN,"speaking, we shall not gather much information about any object that"
6336,THE SUN,covers less than a million.'[13] Since the British Islands have only an
6337,THE SUN,"area of 120,700 square miles, it is evident that on the surface of the"
6338,THE SUN,Sun there are many phenomena and physical changes occurring which escape
6339,THE SUN,our observation. Though the changes which occur in the spots and faculæ
6340,THE SUN,"appear to be slow when observed through the telescope, yet in reality"
6341,THE SUN,they are not so. Tremendous storms and cyclones of intensely heated
6342,THE SUN,"gases, which may be compared to the flames arising from a great furnace,"
6343,THE SUN,sweep over different areas of the Sun with a velocity of hundreds of
6344,THE SUN,miles an hour. Vast ridges and crests of incandescent vapour are
6345,THE SUN,"upheaved by the action of internal heat, which exceeds in intensity the"
6346,THE SUN,temperature at which the most refractory of terrestrial substances can
6347,THE SUN,be volatilised; and downrushes of the same photospheric matter take
6348,THE SUN,place after it has parted with some of its stores of thermal energy.
6349,THE SUN,Sun-spots of considerable magnitude have been observed to grow rapidly
6350,THE SUN,and then disappear in a very short period of time; occasionally a spot
6351,THE SUN,"is seen to divide into two or more portions, the fragments flying"
6352,THE SUN,"asunder with a velocity of not less than 1,000 miles an hour. It is by"
6353,THE SUN,these upheavals and convulsions of the solar atmosphere that the light
6354,THE SUN,and heat are maintained which illumine and vivify the worlds that
6355,THE SUN,gravitate round the Sun.
6356,THE SUN,
6357,THE SUN,"During total eclipses of the Sun, several phenomena become visible which"
6358,THE SUN,have enabled astronomers to gain some further knowledge of the nature of
6359,THE SUN,"the solar appendages. The most important of these is the CHROMOSPHERE,"
6360,THE SUN,which consists of layers of incandescent gases that envelop the
6361,THE SUN,photosphere and completely surround the Sun. Its average depth is from
6362,THE SUN,"5,000 to 6,000 miles, and when seen during an eclipse is of a beautiful"
6363,THE SUN,"rose colour, resembling a sheet of flame. As seen in profile at the edge"
6364,THE SUN,"of the Sun's disc, it presents an irregular serrated appearance, an"
6365,THE SUN,effect created by the protuberance of luminous ridges and
6366,THE SUN,processes--masses of flame which arise from over its entire surface. The
6367,THE SUN,"chromosphere consists chiefly of glowing hydrogen, and an element called"
6368,THE SUN,"_helium_, which has been recently discovered in a terrestrial substance"
6369,THE SUN,"called cleveite; there are also present the vapours of iron, calcium,"
6370,THE SUN,"cerium, titanium, barium, and magnesium. From the surface of this ocean"
6371,THE SUN,"of fire, jets and pointed spires of flaming hydrogen shoot up with"
6372,THE SUN,"amazing velocity, and attain an altitude of ten, twenty, fifty, and even"
6373,THE SUN,"one hundred thousand miles in a very short period of time. They are,"
6374,THE SUN,"however, of an evanescent nature, change rapidly in form and appearance,"
6375,THE SUN,and often in the course of an hour or two die down so as not to be
6376,THE SUN,"recognisable. These _prominences_, as they are called, have been divided"
6377,THE SUN,into two classes. Some are in masses that float like clouds in the
6378,THE SUN,"atmosphere, which they resemble in form and appearance; they are"
6379,THE SUN,"usually attached to the chromosphere by a single stem, or by slender"
6380,THE SUN,columns; occasionally they are entirely free. These are called
6381,THE SUN,"_quiescent_ prominences; they consist of clouds of hydrogen, and are of"
6382,THE SUN,"more lasting duration than the other variety, called _eruptive_ or"
6383,THE SUN,metallic prominences. The latter are usually found in the vicinity of
6384,THE SUN,"sun-spots, and, besides hydrogen, contain the vapours of various metals."
6385,THE SUN,"They are of different forms, and present the appearance of filaments,"
6386,THE SUN,"spikes, and jets of liquid fire; others are pyramidal, convoluted, and"
6387,THE SUN,parabolic.
6388,THE SUN,
6389,THE SUN,"These outbursts, bending over like the jets from a fountain, and"
6390,THE SUN,"descending in graceful curves of flame, ascend from the surface of the"
6391,THE SUN,"chromosphere with a velocity often exceeding 100 miles in a second, and"
6392,THE SUN,"frequently reach an enormous height, but are of transient duration. They"
6393,THE SUN,"are closely connected with sun-spots, and are evidence of the tremendous"
6394,THE SUN,forces that are in action on the surface of the Sun.
6395,THE SUN,
6396,THE SUN,The CORONA is an aureole of light which is seen to surround the Sun
6397,THE SUN,"during a total eclipse. It is an impressive and beautiful phenomenon,"
6398,THE SUN,and is only visible when the Sun is concealed behind the dark body of
6399,THE SUN,the Moon. Professor Young gives the following graphic description of the
6400,THE SUN,corona: 'From behind it [the Moon] stream out on all sides radiant
6401,THE SUN,"filaments, beams, and sheets of pearly light, which reach to a distance"
6402,THE SUN,"sometimes of several degrees from the solar surface, forming an"
6403,THE SUN,"irregular stellate halo, with the black globe of the Moon in its"
6404,THE SUN,"apparent centre. The portion nearest the Sun is of dazzling brightness,"
6405,THE SUN,"but still less brilliant than the prominences, which blaze through it"
6406,THE SUN,like carbuncles. Generally this inner corona has a pretty uniform
6407,THE SUN,"height, forming a ring three or four minutes of arc in width, separated"
6408,THE SUN,"by a somewhat definite outline from the outer corona, which reaches to a"
6409,THE SUN,much greater distance and is far more irregular in form. Usually there
6410,THE SUN,"are several ""rifts,"" as they have been called, like narrow beams of"
6411,THE SUN,"darkness, extending from the very edge of the Sun to the outer night,"
6412,THE SUN,and much resembling the cloud shadows which radiate from the Sun before
6413,THE SUN,"a thundershower. But the edges of these rifts are frequently curved,"
6414,THE SUN,showing them to be something else than real shadows. Sometimes there are
6415,THE SUN,"narrow bright streamers as long as the rifts, or longer. These are often"
6416,THE SUN,"inclined, or occasionally even nearly tangential to the solar surface,"
6417,THE SUN,"and frequently are curved. On the whole, the corona is usually less"
6418,THE SUN,"extensive and brilliant over the solar poles, and there is a"
6419,THE SUN,"recognisable tendency to accumulation above the middle latitudes, or"
6420,THE SUN,"spot zones; so that, speaking roughly, the corona shows a disposition to"
6421,THE SUN,"assume the form of a quadrilateral or four-rayed star, though in almost"
6422,THE SUN,every individual case this form is greatly modified by abnormal
6423,THE SUN,streamers at some point or other.' The corona surrounds the Sun and its
6424,THE SUN,other envelopes to a depth of many thousands of miles. It consists of
6425,THE SUN,various elements which exist in a condition of extreme tenuity;
6426,THE SUN,"hydrogen, helium, and a substance called coronium appear to predominate,"
6427,THE SUN,whilst finely divided shining particles of matter and electrical
6428,THE SUN,discharges resembling those of an aurora assist in its illumination.
6429,THE SUN,
6430,THE SUN,[Illustration: FIG. 7.--The Corona during the Eclipse of May 1883.]
6431,THE SUN,
6432,THE SUN,We possess no knowledge of the physical structure of the interior of the
6433,THE SUN,"Sun, nor have we any terrestrial analogy to guide us as to how matter"
6434,THE SUN,would behave when subjected to such conditions of extreme temperature
6435,THE SUN,and pressure as exist in the interior of the orb. Yet we are justified
6436,THE SUN,in concluding that the Sun is mainly a gaseous sphere which is slowly
6437,THE SUN,"contracting, and that the energy expended in this process is being"
6438,THE SUN,transformed into heat so extreme as to render the orb a great fountain
6439,THE SUN,of light.
6440,THE SUN,
6441,THE SUN,Milton in his poem makes more frequent allusion to the Sun than to any
6442,THE SUN,"of the other orbs of the firmament, and, in all his references to the"
6443,THE SUN,"great luminary, describes him in a manner worthy of his unrivalled"
6444,THE SUN,"splendour, and of his supreme importance in the system which he upholds"
6445,THE SUN,"and governs. After having alighted on Mount Niphates, Satan is described"
6446,THE SUN,as looking
6447,THE SUN,
6448,THE SUN,"Sometimes towards Heaven and the full-blazing Sun,"
6449,THE SUN,Which now sat high in his meridian tower.--iv. 29-30.
6450,THE SUN,
6451,THE SUN,He then addresses him thus:--
6452,THE SUN,
6453,THE SUN,"O thou that with surpassing glory crowned,"
6454,THE SUN,Look'st from thy sole dominion like the god
6455,THE SUN,Of this new World--at whose sight all the stars
6456,THE SUN,"Hide their diminished heads--to thee I call,"
6457,THE SUN,"But with no friendly voice, and add thy name,"
6458,THE SUN,"O Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams,"
6459,THE SUN,That bring to my remembrance from what state
6460,THE SUN,"I fell, how glorious once above thy sphere.--iv. 32-39."
6461,THE SUN,
6462,THE SUN,On another occasion:--
6463,THE SUN,
6464,THE SUN,The golden Sun in splendour likest Heaven
6465,THE SUN,Allured his eye.--iii. 572-73.
6466,THE SUN,
6467,THE SUN,"In describing the different periods of the day, Milton seldom fails to"
6468,THE SUN,"associate the Sun with these times, and rightly so, since they are"
6469,THE SUN,brought about by the apparent diurnal journey of the orb across the
6470,THE SUN,"heavens. Commencing with morning, he says:--"
6471,THE SUN,
6472,THE SUN,"Meanwhile,"
6473,THE SUN,"To re-salute the world with sacred light,"
6474,THE SUN,"Leucothea waked, and with fresh dews embalmed"
6475,THE SUN,The Earth.--xi. 133-36.
6476,THE SUN,
6477,THE SUN,Soon as they forth were come to open sight
6478,THE SUN,"Of day-spring, and the Sun--who, scarce up-risen,"
6479,THE SUN,"With wheels yet hovering o'er the ocean-brim,"
6480,THE SUN,"Shot parallel to the Earth his dewy ray,"
6481,THE SUN,Discovering in wide landskip all the east
6482,THE SUN,Of Paradise and Eden's happy plains.--v. 138-43
6483,THE SUN,
6484,THE SUN,or some renowned metropolis
6485,THE SUN,"With glistering spires and pinnacles adorned,"
6486,THE SUN,Which now the rising Sun gilds with his beams.--iii. 549-51.
6487,THE SUN,
6488,THE SUN,while now the mounted Sun
6489,THE SUN,"Shot down direct his fervid rays, to warm"
6490,THE SUN,Earth's inmost womb.--v. 300-302.
6491,THE SUN,
6492,THE SUN,for scarce the Sun
6493,THE SUN,"Hath finished half his journey, and scarce begins"
6494,THE SUN,His other half in the great zone of Heaven.--v. 558-60.
6495,THE SUN,
6496,THE SUN,"To sit and taste, till this meridian heat"
6497,THE SUN,"Be over, and the Sun more cool decline.--v. 369-70."
6498,THE SUN,
6499,THE SUN,And the great Light of Day yet wants to run
6500,THE SUN,"Much of his race, though steep. Suspense in Heaven,"
6501,THE SUN,"Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he hears,"
6502,THE SUN,"And longer will delay, to hear thee tell"
6503,THE SUN,"His generation, and the rising birth"
6504,THE SUN,Of Nature from the unapparent deep.--vii. 98-103.
6505,THE SUN,
6506,THE SUN,The declining day and approach of evening are described as follows:--
6507,THE SUN,
6508,THE SUN,"Meanwhile in utmost longitude, where Heaven"
6509,THE SUN,"With Earth and Ocean meets, the setting Sun"
6510,THE SUN,"Slowly descended, and with right aspect"
6511,THE SUN,Against the eastern gate of Paradise
6512,THE SUN,Levelled his evening rays.--iv. 539-43.
6513,THE SUN,
6514,THE SUN,the Sun now fallen
6515,THE SUN,"Beneath the Azores; whether the Prime Orb,"
6516,THE SUN,"Incredible how swift, had thither rolled"
6517,THE SUN,"Diurnal, or this less volubil Earth,"
6518,THE SUN,"By shorter flight to the east, had left him there"
6519,THE SUN,Arraying with reflected purple and gold
6520,THE SUN,The clouds that on his western throne attend.--iv. 591-97.
6521,THE SUN,
6522,THE SUN,the parting Sun
6523,THE SUN,Beyond the Earth's green Cape and verdant Isles
6524,THE SUN,"Hesperian sets, my signal to depart.--viii. 630-32."
6525,THE SUN,
6526,THE SUN,Now was the Sun in western cadence low
6527,THE SUN,"From noon, and gentle airs due at their hour"
6528,THE SUN,"To fan the Earth now waked, and usher in"
6529,THE SUN,The evening cool.--x. 92-95.
6530,THE SUN,
6531,THE SUN,"for the Sun,"
6532,THE SUN,"Declined, was hasting now with prone career"
6533,THE SUN,"To the Ocean Isles, and in the ascending scale"
6534,THE SUN,Of Heaven the stars that usher evening rose.--iv. 352-55.
6535,THE SUN,
6536,THE SUN,"In the combat between Michael and Satan, which ended in the overthrow of"
6537,THE SUN,"the rebel angels, Milton, in his description of their armour, says:--"
6538,THE SUN,
6539,THE SUN,two broad suns their shields
6540,THE SUN,"Blazed opposite.--vi. 305-306,"
6541,THE SUN,
6542,THE SUN,"and in describing the faded splendour of the ruined Archangel, the poet"
6543,THE SUN,compares him to the Sun when seen under conditions which temporarily
6544,THE SUN,deprive him of his dazzling brilliancy and glory:--
6545,THE SUN,
6546,THE SUN,as when the Sun new-risen
6547,THE SUN,Looks through the horizontal misty air
6548,THE SUN,"Shorn of his beams, or, from behind the Moon"
6549,THE SUN,"In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds"
6550,THE SUN,"On half the nations, and with fear of change"
6551,THE SUN,Perplexes monarchs.--i. 594-99.
6552,THE SUN,
6553,THE SUN,This passage affords us an example of the sublimity of Milton's
6554,THE SUN,imagination and of his skill in adapting the grandest phenomena in
6555,THE SUN,Nature to the illustration of his subject.
6556,THE SUN,
6557,THE SUN,
6558,THE MOON,THE MOON
6559,THE MOON,
6560,THE MOON,"The Moon is the Earth's satellite, and next to the Sun is the most"
6561,THE MOON,important of the celestial orbs so far as its relations with our globe
6562,THE MOON,"are concerned. Besides affording us light by night, the Moon is the"
6563,THE MOON,principal cause of the ebb and flow of the tide--a phenomenon of much
6564,THE MOON,"importance to navigators. The Moon is almost a perfect sphere, and is"
6565,THE MOON,"2,160 miles in diameter. The form of its orbit is that of an ellipse"
6566,THE MOON,with the Earth in the lower focus. It revolves round its primary in 27
6567,THE MOON,"days 7 hours, at a mean distance of 237,000 miles, and with a velocity"
6568,THE MOON,"of 2,273 miles an hour. Its equatorial velocity of rotation is 10 miles"
6569,THE MOON,"an hour. The density of the Moon is 3·57 that of water, or 0·63 that of"
6570,THE MOON,"the Earth; eighty globes, each of the weight of the Moon, would be"
6571,THE MOON,"required to counterbalance the weight of the Earth, and fifty globes of"
6572,THE MOON,a similar size to equal it in dimensions. The orb rotates on its axis in
6573,THE MOON,the same period of time in which it accomplishes a revolution of its
6574,THE MOON,orbit; consequently the same illumined surface of the Moon is always
6575,THE MOON,directed towards the Earth. To the naked eye the Moon appears as large
6576,THE MOON,"as the Sun, and it very rapidly changes its form and position in the"
6577,THE MOON,"sky. Its motions, which are of a very complex character, have been for"
6578,THE MOON,many ages the subject of investigation by mathematicians and
6579,THE MOON,"astronomers, but their difficulties may now be regarded as having been"
6580,THE MOON,finally overcome.
6581,THE MOON,
6582,THE MOON,The phases of the Moon are always interesting and very beautiful. The
6583,THE MOON,"orb is first seen in the west, after sunset, as a delicate slender"
6584,THE MOON,"crescent of pale light; each night it increases in size, whilst it"
6585,THE MOON,"travels eastward, until it attains the figure of a half moon; still"
6586,THE MOON,"growing larger as it pursues its course, it finally becomes a full"
6587,THE MOON,"resplendent globe, rising about the time that the Sun sets and situated"
6588,THE MOON,"directly opposite to him. Then, in a reverse manner, after full moon, it"
6589,THE MOON,"goes through the same phases, until, as a slender crescent, it becomes"
6590,THE MOON,"invisible in the solar rays; afterwards to re-appear in a few days, and,"
6591,THE MOON,"in its monthly round, to undergo the same cycle of changes. The phases"
6592,THE MOON,of the Moon depend upon the changing position of the orb with regard to
6593,THE MOON,"the Sun. The Moon shines by reflected light derived from the Sun, and as"
6594,THE MOON,one half of its surface is always illumined and the other half totally
6595,THE MOON,"dark, the crescent increases or diminishes when, by the Moon's change of"
6596,THE MOON,"position, we see more or less of the bright side. Visible at first as a"
6597,THE MOON,"slender crescent near the setting Sun, the angular distance from the orb"
6598,THE MOON,"and the width of the crescent increase daily, until, at the expiration"
6599,THE MOON,"of seven days, the Moon is distant one quarter of the circumference of"
6600,THE MOON,"the heavens from the Sun. The Moon is then a semi-circle, or in"
6601,THE MOON,"quadrature. At the end of other seven days, the distance of the Moon"
6602,THE MOON,from the Sun is at its greatest--half the circumference of its orbit. It
6603,THE MOON,is then visible as a circular disc and we behold the orb as full moon.
6604,THE MOON,"The waning Moon, as it gradually decreases, presents the same aspects"
6605,THE MOON,"reversed, and, finally, its slender crescent disappears in the Sun's"
6606,THE MOON,rays. The convex edge of the crescent is always turned towards the Sun.
6607,THE MOON,The rising of the Moon in the east and its setting in the west is an
6608,THE MOON,"effect due to the diurnal rotation of the Earth on her axis, but the orb"
6609,THE MOON,"can be perceived to have two motions besides: one from west to east,"
6610,THE MOON,"which carries it round the heavens in 29·53 days, and another from north"
6611,THE MOON,"to south. The west to east motion is steady and continuous, but, owing"
6612,THE MOON,"to the Sun's attractive force, the Moon is made to swerve from its path,"
6613,THE MOON,giving rise to irregularities of its motion called PERTURBATIONS. The
6614,THE MOON,"most important of these is the _annual equation_, discovered by Tycho"
6615,THE MOON,Brahé--a yearly effect produced by the Sun's disturbing influence as the
6616,THE MOON,"Earth approaches or recedes from him in her orbit; another irregularity,"
6617,THE MOON,"called the _evection_, is a change in the eccentricity of the lunar"
6618,THE MOON,"orbit, by which the mean longitude of the Moon is increased or"
6619,THE MOON,"diminished. _Elliptic inequality_, _parallactic inequality_, the"
6620,THE MOON,"_variation_, and _secular acceleration_, are other perturbations of the"
6621,THE MOON,"lunar motion, which depend directly or indirectly on the attractive"
6622,THE MOON,influence of the Sun and the motion of the Earth in her orbit.
6623,THE MOON,
6624,THE MOON,As the plane of the Moon's orbit is inclined at an angle of rather more
6625,THE MOON,"than 5° to the ecliptic, it follows that the orb, in its journey round"
6626,THE MOON,"the Earth, intersects this great circle at two points called the"
6627,THE MOON,'Nodes.' When crossing the ecliptic from south to north the Moon is in
6628,THE MOON,"its ascending node, and when crossing from north to south in its"
6629,THE MOON,descending node. In December the Moon reaches the most northern point of
6630,THE MOON,"its course, and in June the southernmost. Consequently we have during"
6631,THE MOON,"the winter nights the greatest amount of moonlight, and in summer the"
6632,THE MOON,least. In the evenings the moonlight is least in March and greatest in
6633,THE MOON,"September, when we have what is called the Harvest Moon."
6634,THE MOON,
6635,THE MOON,"The telescopic appearance of the Moon is very interesting and beautiful,"
6636,THE MOON,especially if the orb is observed when waxing and waning. As no aqueous
6637,THE MOON,"vapour or cloud obscures the lunar surface, all its details can be"
6638,THE MOON,"perceived with great clearness and distinctness. Indeed, the topography"
6639,THE MOON,"of the Moon is better known than that of the Earth, for the whole of its"
6640,THE MOON,surface has been mapped and delineated with great accuracy and
6641,THE MOON,"precision. The Moon is in no sense a duplicate of its primary, and no"
6642,THE MOON,analogy exists between the Earth and her satellite. Evidence is wanting
6643,THE MOON,of the existence of an atmosphere surrounding the Moon; no clouds or
6644,THE MOON,"exhalations can be perceived, and no water is believed to exist on the"
6645,THE MOON,"lunar surface. Consequently there are no oceans, seas, rivers, or lakes;"
6646,THE MOON,"no fertile plains or forest-clad mountains, such as are found upon the"
6647,THE MOON,"Earth. Indeed, all the conditions essential for the support and"
6648,THE MOON,maintenance of organic life by which we are surrounded appear to be
6649,THE MOON,nonexistent on the Moon. Our satellite has no seasons; its axial
6650,THE MOON,rotation is so slow that one lunar day is equal in length to fourteen of
6651,THE MOON,our days; this period of sunshine is succeeded by a night of similar
6652,THE MOON,duration. The alternation of such lengthened days and nights subjects
6653,THE MOON,the lunar surface to great extremes of heat and cold.
6654,THE MOON,
6655,THE MOON,"When viewed with a telescope, the surface of the Moon is perceived to"
6656,THE MOON,"consist of lofty mountain chains with rugged peaks, numerous extinct"
6657,THE MOON,"volcanoes called crater mountains, hills, clefts, chasms, valleys, and"
6658,THE MOON,"level plains--a region of desolation, presenting to our gaze the"
6659,THE MOON,"shattered and upturned fragments of the Moon's crust, convulsed by"
6660,THE MOON,forces of a volcanic nature which have long since expended their
6661,THE MOON,energies and died out. The mountain ranges on the Moon resemble those of
6662,THE MOON,"the Earth, but they have a more rugged outline, and their peaks are more"
6663,THE MOON,"precipitous, some of them rising to a height of 20,000 feet. They are"
6664,THE MOON,"called the Lunar Alps, Apennines, and Cordilleras, and embrace every"
6665,THE MOON,"variety of hill, cliff, mound, and ridge of comparatively low"
6666,THE MOON,"elevation. The plains are large level areas, which are situated on"
6667,THE MOON,various parts of the lunar surface; they are of a darker hue than the
6668,THE MOON,"mountainous regions by which they are surrounded, and were at one time"
6669,THE MOON,"believed to be seas. They are analogous to the prairies, steppes, and"
6670,THE MOON,deserts of the Earth.
6671,THE MOON,
6672,THE MOON,"_Valleys._--Some of these are of spacious dimensions; others are narrow,"
6673,THE MOON,and contract into gorges and chasms. Clefts or rills are long cracks or
6674,THE MOON,"fissures of considerable depth, which extend sometimes for hundreds of"
6675,THE MOON,miles across the various strata of which the Moon's crust is composed.
6676,THE MOON,
6677,THE MOON,The characteristic features of the Moon's surface are the crater
6678,THE MOON,"mountains: they are very numerous on certain portions of the lunar disc,"
6679,THE MOON,and give the Moon the freckled appearance which it presents in the
6680,THE MOON,"telescope, and which Galileo likened to the eyes in the feathers of a"
6681,THE MOON,"peacock's tail. They are believed to be of volcanic origin, and have"
6682,THE MOON,"been classified as follows: 'Walled plains, mountain rings, ring plains,"
6683,THE MOON,"crater plains, craters, craterlets, and crater cones.' Upwards of 13,000"
6684,THE MOON,"of these mountains have been enumerated, and 1,000 are known to have a"
6685,THE MOON,diameter exceeding nine miles. Walled plains consist of circular areas
6686,THE MOON,which have a width varying from 150 miles to a few hundred yards. They
6687,THE MOON,"are enclosed by rocky ramparts, whilst the centre is occupied by an"
6688,THE MOON,"elevated peak. The depth of these formations, which are often far below"
6689,THE MOON,"the level of the Moon's surface, ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 feet."
6690,THE MOON,"Mountain rings, ring plains, and crater plains resemble those already"
6691,THE MOON,"described, but are on a smaller scale; the floors of the larger ones are"
6692,THE MOON,frequently occupied by craters and craterlets. The latter exist in large
6693,THE MOON,"numbers, and some portions of the Moon's surface appear honeycombed with"
6694,THE MOON,"them, the smaller craters resting on the sides of larger ones and"
6695,THE MOON,occupying the bottoms of the more extensive areas. There is no kind of
6696,THE MOON,formation on the Earth's surface that can be compared with these crater
6697,THE MOON,"mountains, which indicate that the Moon was at one time a fiery globe"
6698,THE MOON,convulsed by internal forces which found an outlet in the numerous
6699,THE MOON,volcanoes scattered over her surface.
6700,THE MOON,
6701,THE MOON,The most remarkable of these volcanic mountains have been named after
6702,THE MOON,distinguished men. (1) Copernicus is one of the most imposing; its
6703,THE MOON,"crater is 56 miles in diameter, and situated at its centre is a mountain"
6704,THE MOON,"with six peaks 2,400 feet in height. The ring by which it is surrounded"
6705,THE MOON,"rises 11,000 feet above the floor of the crater, and consists of"
6706,THE MOON,terraces believed to have been created by the partial congelation and
6707,THE MOON,periodic subsidence of a lake of molten lava which occupied the enclosed
6708,THE MOON,area.
6709,THE MOON,
6710,THE MOON,"(2) Tycho is one of the most magnificent and perfect of lunar volcanoes,"
6711,THE MOON,"and is also remarkable as being a centre from which, when the Moon is"
6712,THE MOON,"full, there radiates a number of bright streaks which extend across the"
6713,THE MOON,"lunar surface, over mountain and valley, through ring and crater, for"
6714,THE MOON,"many hundreds of miles. Their nature is unknown, and nothing resembling"
6715,THE MOON,them is found on the Earth. Tycho has a diameter of 50 miles and a
6716,THE MOON,"depth of 17,000 feet. The peak which rises from the floor of the crater"
6717,THE MOON,"attains a height of 6,000 feet, and the rampart consists of a series of"
6718,THE MOON,terraces which give variety to the appearance of the inner wall. The
6719,THE MOON,surface of the Moon round Tycho is honeycombed with small volcanoes.
6720,THE MOON,
6721,THE MOON,(3) Clavius is one of the most extensive of the walled plains; it has a
6722,THE MOON,"diameter of 142 miles and an area of 16,500 square miles. The rocky"
6723,THE MOON,"annulus which surrounds it is very lofty and precipitous, and at one"
6724,THE MOON,"point reaches a height of 17,300 feet. Upwards of 90 craters have been"
6725,THE MOON,"counted within this space, one of the peaks attaining to an elevation of"
6726,THE MOON,"24,000 feet above the level floor of the plain. It is believed that the"
6727,THE MOON,lowest depths of this wild and precipitous region are never penetrated
6728,THE MOON,"by sunlight, they are so overshadowed by towering crag and fell which"
6729,THE MOON,"intercept the solar rays; and, as there is no atmosphere to cause"
6730,THE MOON,"reflection, they are consequently enveloped in perpetual darkness."
6731,THE MOON,
6732,THE MOON,"(4) Plato has a diameter of about 60 miles and an area of 2,700 square"
6733,THE MOON,"miles; its central peak rises to a height of 7,300 feet. It has an"
6734,THE MOON,"irregular rampart which is broken up into terraces averaging about 4,000"
6735,THE MOON,"feet high; three cones, each with an elevation of from 7,000 to 9,000"
6736,THE MOON,"feet, rest on its western border."
6737,THE MOON,
6738,THE MOON,(5) Theophilus is the deepest of the visible craters on the Moon. It has
6739,THE MOON,"a diameter of 64 miles, and the inner edge of the ring rises from the"
6740,THE MOON,"level floor to a height ranging from 14,000 to 18,000 feet. A group of"
6741,THE MOON,"mountains occupies the centre of the area, the highest peak of which"
6742,THE MOON,"reaches an elevation of 5,200 feet. Cyrillus and Catharina, two adjacent"
6743,THE MOON,"craters, are each about 16,000 feet deep and connected by a wide valley."
6744,THE MOON,
6745,THE MOON,"(6) Aristarchus is the brightest spot on the Moon, and appears almost"
6746,THE MOON,"dazzling in the telescope. The crater has a diameter of 42 miles, the"
6747,THE MOON,centre of which is occupied by a steep mountain. The rampart on the
6748,THE MOON,"western side rises to a height of 7,500 feet, on the east it becomes a"
6749,THE MOON,plateau which connects it with a smaller crater called Herodotus. Bright
6750,THE MOON,"streaks radiate from Aristarchus when there is full moon, and extend for"
6751,THE MOON,a considerable distance over the surface of the orb.
6752,THE MOON,
6753,THE MOON,Though the face of the Moon has been carefully scanned for two centuries
6754,THE MOON,"and a half, and selenographers have mapped and delineated her features"
6755,THE MOON,"with the utmost accuracy and precision, yet no perceptible change of a"
6756,THE MOON,reliable character has been perceived to occur on any part of the orb.
6757,THE MOON,The surface of the hemisphere directed towards the Earth appears to be
6758,THE MOON,"an alternation of desert plains, craggy wildernesses, and extinct"
6759,THE MOON,"volcanoes--a region of desolation unoccupied by any living thing, and"
6760,THE MOON,'upon which the light of life has never dawned.' Owing to the absence of
6761,THE MOON,"an atmosphere, there is neither diffuse daylight nor twilight on the"
6762,THE MOON,Moon. Every portion of the lunar surface not exposed to the Sun's rays
6763,THE MOON,"is shrouded in darkness, and black shadows can be observed fringing"
6764,THE MOON,prominences of silvery whiteness. If the Moon were enveloped in an
6765,THE MOON,"atmosphere similar to that which surrounds the Earth, the reflection and"
6766,THE MOON,diffusion of light among the minute particles of watery vapour which
6767,THE MOON,permeate it would give rise to a gradual transition from light to
6768,THE MOON,darkness; the lunar surface would be visible when not illumined by the
6769,THE MOON,"direct rays of the Sun, and before sunrise and after sunset, dawn and"
6770,THE MOON,twilight would occur as upon the Earth. But upon the Moon there is no
6771,THE MOON,"dawn, and the darkness of night envelops the orb until the appearance of"
6772,THE MOON,"the edge of the Sun's disc above the horizon, then his dazzling rays"
6773,THE MOON,illumine the summits and loftiest peaks of the lunar mountains whilst
6774,THE MOON,yet their sides and bases are wrapped in deep gloom. Since the pace of
6775,THE MOON,"the Sun across the lunar heavens is 28 times slower than it is with us,"
6776,THE MOON,"there is continuous sunshine on the Moon for 304 hours, and this long"
6777,THE MOON,day--equal to about a fortnight of our time--is succeeded by a night of
6778,THE MOON,similar duration. As there is no atmosphere overhead to diffuse or
6779,THE MOON,"reflect the light, the Sun shines in a pitch-black sky, and at lunar"
6780,THE MOON,noonday the planets and constellations can be seen displaying a
6781,THE MOON,brilliancy of greater intensity than can be perceived on Earth during
6782,THE MOON,"the darkest night. Every portion of the Moon's surface is bleak, bare,"
6783,THE MOON,and untouched by any softening influences. No gentle gale ever sweeps
6784,THE MOON,down her valleys or disturbs the dead calm that hangs over this world;
6785,THE MOON,no cloud ever tempers the fierce glare of the Sun that pours down his
6786,THE MOON,unmitigated rays from a sky of inky blackness; no refreshing shower ever
6787,THE MOON,falls upon her arid mountains and plains; no sound ever breaks the
6788,THE MOON,profound stillness that reigns over this realm of solitude and
6789,THE MOON,desolation.

6792,THE MOON,
6793,THE MOON,"As might be expected, Milton makes frequent allusion to the Moon in"
6794,THE MOON,"'Paradise Lost,' and does not fail to set forth the distinctive charms"
6795,THE MOON,associated with the unrivalled queen of the firmament. The majority of
6796,THE MOON,poets would most likely regard a description of evening as incomplete
6797,THE MOON,"without an allusion to the Moon. Milton has adhered to this sentiment,"
6798,THE MOON,as may be perceived in the following lines:--
6799,THE MOON,
6800,THE MOON,"till the Moon,"
6801,THE MOON,"Rising in clouded majesty, at length"
6802,THE MOON,"Apparent queen, unveiled her peerless light,"
6803,THE MOON,And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw.--iv. 606-609.
6804,THE MOON,
6805,THE MOON,now reigns
6806,THE MOON,"Full-orbed the Moon, and with more pleasing light,"
6807,THE MOON,Shadowy sets off the face of things.--v. 41-43.
6808,THE MOON,
6809,THE MOON,The association of the Moon with the nocturnal revels and dances of
6810,THE MOON,elves and fairies is felicitously expressed in the following passage:--
6811,THE MOON,
6812,THE MOON,"or faëry elves,"
6813,THE MOON,"Whose midnight revels, by a forest side"
6814,THE MOON,"Or fountain, some belated peasant sees,"
6815,THE MOON,"Or dreams he sees, while overhead the Moon"
6816,THE MOON,"Sits arbitress, and nearer to the Earth"
6817,THE MOON,Wheels her pale course.--i. 781-86.
6818,THE MOON,
6819,THE MOON,"In contrast with this, we have Milton's description of the Moon when"
6820,THE MOON,affected by the demoniacal practices of the 'night-hag' who was believed
6821,THE MOON,"to destroy infants for the sake of drinking their blood, and applying"
6822,THE MOON,their mangled limbs to the purposes of incantation. The legend is of
6823,THE MOON,Scandinavian origin and the locality Lapland:--
6824,THE MOON,
6825,THE MOON,"Nor uglier follow the night-hag, when called"
6826,THE MOON,"In secret, riding through the air she comes,"
6827,THE MOON,"Lured with the smell of infant blood, to dance"
6828,THE MOON,"With Lapland witches, while the labouring Moon"
6829,THE MOON,Eclipses at their charms.--ii. 662-66.
6830,THE MOON,
6831,THE MOON,"In his description of the massive shield carried by Satan, the poet"
6832,THE MOON,compares it with the full moon:--
6833,THE MOON,
6834,THE MOON,his ponderous shield
6835,THE MOON,"Ethereal temper, massy, large, and round,"
6836,THE MOON,Behind him cast. The broad circumference
6837,THE MOON,Hung on his shoulders like the Moon.--i. 284-87.
6838,THE MOON,
6839,THE MOON,"The phases displayed by the Moon in her monthly journey round the Earth,"
6840,THE MOON,and which lend a variety of charm to the appearances presented by the
6841,THE MOON,"orb, are poetically described by Milton in the following lines:--"
6842,THE MOON,
6843,THE MOON,but there the neighbouring Moon
6844,THE MOON,(So call that opposite fair star) her aid
6845,THE MOON,"Timely interposes, and her monthly round"
6846,THE MOON,"Still ending, still renewing, through mid-Heaven"
6847,THE MOON,With borrowed light her countenance triform
6848,THE MOON,"Hence fills and empties, to enlighten the Earth,"
6849,THE MOON,And in her pale dominion checks the night.--iii. 726-32.
6850,THE MOON,
6851,THE MOON,It is interesting to observe how aptly Milton describes the subdued
6852,THE MOON,"illumination of the Moon's reflected light, as compared with the"
6853,THE MOON,"brilliant radiance of the blazing Sun, and how the distinguishing glory"
6854,THE MOON,peculiar to each orb is appropriately set forth in the various passages
6855,THE MOON,in which they are described; their contrasted splendour enhancing rather
6856,THE MOON,than detracting from the grandeur and beauty belonging to each.
6857,THE MOON,
6858,THE MOON,
6859,THE PLANET EARTH[14],THE PLANET EARTH[14]
6860,THE PLANET EARTH[14],
6861,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"No lovelier planet circles round the Sun than the planet Earth, with her"
6862,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"oceans and continents, her mountains, valleys, rivers, lakes, and"
6863,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"plains; surrounded by heaven's azure, radiant with the sunlight of her"
6864,THE PLANET EARTH[14],day and adorned by night with countless sparkling points of gold. This
6865,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"beautiful world, the abode of MAN, is of paramount importance to us, and"
6866,THE PLANET EARTH[14],is the only part of the universe of which we have any direct knowledge.
6867,THE PLANET EARTH[14],
6868,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"The Earth may be regarded as one of the Sun's numerous family, and is"
6869,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"situated third in order from the refulgent orb, round which it revolves"
6870,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"in an elliptical orbit at a mean distance of 92,800,000 miles. The Earth"
6871,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"is nearest to the Sun at the end of December, and furthest away at the"
6872,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"beginning of July; the difference between those distances is 3,250,000"
6873,THE PLANET EARTH[14],miles--the extent of the eccentricity of the planet's orbit. The figure
6874,THE PLANET EARTH[14],of the Earth is that of an oblate spheroid; it is slightly flattened at
6875,THE PLANET EARTH[14],the poles and bulges at the equator. Its polar or shortest diameter is
6876,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"7,899 miles, its equatorial diameter is 7,926 miles--greater than the"
6877,THE PLANET EARTH[14],other by 27 miles. The circumference of the Earth at the equator is
6878,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"24,899 miles, and the total area of its surface is 197,000,000 square"
6879,THE PLANET EARTH[14],miles. Its mean density is 5-1/2 times greater than that of water.
6880,THE PLANET EARTH[14],
6881,THE PLANET EARTH[14],The two principal motions performed by the Earth are: (1) Rotation on
6882,THE PLANET EARTH[14],its axis; (2) its annual revolution round the Sun. The Earth always
6883,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"rotates in the same manner, and in the same direction, from west to"
6884,THE PLANET EARTH[14],east. As the axis of rotation corresponds with the shortest diameter of
6885,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"the planet, it affords strong evidence that the Earth assumed its"
6886,THE PLANET EARTH[14],present shape whilst rapidly rotating round its axis when in a fluid or
6887,THE PLANET EARTH[14],plastic condition. This would accord with the nebular hypothesis. The
6888,THE PLANET EARTH[14],ends of the Earth's axis are called the poles of the Earth; one is the
6889,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"north, the other the south pole. The north pole is directed towards a"
6890,THE PLANET EARTH[14],star in the Lesser Bear called the Pole Star. The south pole is directed
6891,THE PLANET EARTH[14],to a corresponding opposite part of the heavens. The Earth's axis is
6892,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"inclined 63° 33´ to the plane of the ecliptic, and is always directed to"
6893,THE PLANET EARTH[14],the same point in the heavens. The Earth accomplishes a revolution on
6894,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"its axis in 23 hours 56 minutes 4 seconds mean solar time, which is the"
6895,THE PLANET EARTH[14],length of the sidereal day. This rate of rotation is invariable. At the
6896,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"equator, where the circumference of the globe exceeds 24,000 miles, the"
6897,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"velocity of a point on its surface is upwards of 1,000 miles an hour,"
6898,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"but, as the poles are approached, the tangential velocity diminishes,"
6899,THE PLANET EARTH[14],and at those points it is entirely absent. The Earth accomplishes a
6900,THE PLANET EARTH[14],revolution of her orbit in 365 days 6 hours 9 minutes; in her journey
6901,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"round the Sun she travels a circuit of 580,000,000 miles at an average"
6902,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"pace of 66,000 miles an hour. The Earth has other slight motions called"
6903,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"_perturbations_, which are produced by the gravitational attraction of"
6904,THE PLANET EARTH[14],other members of the solar system. The most important of these is
6905,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Precession of the Equinoxes, which is caused by the attraction of the"
6906,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Sun, Moon, and planets, on the protuberant equatorial region of the"
6907,THE PLANET EARTH[14],globe. This attraction has a tendency to turn the Earth's axis at right
6908,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"angles to her orbit, but it only results in the slow rotation of the"
6909,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"pole of the equator round that of the ecliptic, which is occurring at"
6910,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"the rate of 1° in 70 years, and will require a period of 25,868 years to"
6911,THE PLANET EARTH[14],complete an entire revolution of the heavens.
6912,THE PLANET EARTH[14],
6913,THE PLANET EARTH[14],The spot on Earth round which is centred the chief interest in Milton's
6914,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"poem is Paradise, which was situated in the east of Eden, a district of"
6915,THE PLANET EARTH[14],Central Asia. It was here where God ordained that man should first
6916,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"dwell--a place created for his enjoyment and delight. Satan, after his"
6917,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"soliloquy on Mount Niphates, directs his way to Paradise, and arrives"
6918,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"first in Eden, where he beholds from a distance the Happy Garden--"
6919,THE PLANET EARTH[14],
6920,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"So on he fares, and to the border comes"
6921,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Of Eden, where delicious Paradise,"
6922,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Now nearer, crowns with her enclosure green,"
6923,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"As with a rural mound, the champain head"
6924,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Of a steep wilderness, whose hairy sides"
6925,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"With thicket overgrown, grotesque and wild,"
6926,THE PLANET EARTH[14],Access denied; and overhead upgrew
6927,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Insuperable highth of loftiest shade,"
6928,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Cedar, and pine, and fir, and branching palm,"
6929,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"A sylvan scene, and, as the ranks ascend,"
6930,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Shade above shade, a woody theatre"
6931,THE PLANET EARTH[14],Of stateliest view. Yet higher than their tops
6932,THE PLANET EARTH[14],The verdurous wall of Paradise up-sprung;
6933,THE PLANET EARTH[14],Which to our general sire gave prospect large
6934,THE PLANET EARTH[14],Into his nether empire neighbouring round.
6935,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"And higher than that wall, a circling row"
6936,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Of goodliest trees, loaden with fairest fruit,"
6937,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue,"
6938,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Appeared, with gay enamelled colours mixed;"
6939,THE PLANET EARTH[14],On which the Sun more glad impressed his beams
6940,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Than in fair evening cloud, or humid bow,"
6941,THE PLANET EARTH[14],When God hath showered the Earth: so lovely seemed
6942,THE PLANET EARTH[14],That landskip. And of pure now purer air
6943,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires"
6944,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Vernal delight and joy, able to drive"
6945,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"All sadness but despair. Now gentle gales,"
6946,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Fanning their odoriferous wings, dispense"
6947,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole"
6948,THE PLANET EARTH[14],Those balmy spoils.--iv. 131-59.
6949,THE PLANET EARTH[14],
6950,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Satan, having gained admission to the Garden by overleaping the tangled"
6951,THE PLANET EARTH[14],thicket of shrubs and bushes which formed an impenetrable barrier and
6952,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"prevented any access to the enclosure within, he flew up on to the Tree"
6953,THE PLANET EARTH[14],of Life--
6954,THE PLANET EARTH[14],
6955,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Beneath him, with new wonder, now he views,"
6956,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"To all delight of human sense exposed,"
6957,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"In narrow room Nature's whole wealth; yea, more!--"
6958,THE PLANET EARTH[14],A Heaven on Earth: for blissful Paradise
6959,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Of God the garden was, by Him in the east"
6960,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Of Eden planted, Eden stretched her line"
6961,THE PLANET EARTH[14],From Auran eastward to the royal towers
6962,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Of great Seleucia, built by Grecian kings,"
6963,THE PLANET EARTH[14],Or where the sons of Eden long before
6964,THE PLANET EARTH[14],Dwelt in Telassar. In this pleasant soil
6965,THE PLANET EARTH[14],His far more pleasant garden God ordained.
6966,THE PLANET EARTH[14],Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow
6967,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"All trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste;"
6968,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"And all amid them stood the Tree of Life,"
6969,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"High eminent, blooming ambrosial fruit"
6970,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Of vegetable gold; and next to life,"
6971,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Our death, the Tree of Knowledge, grew fast by--"
6972,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Knowledge of good, bought dear by knowing ill."
6973,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Southward through Eden went a river large,"
6974,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Nor changed his course, but through the shaggy hill"
6975,THE PLANET EARTH[14],Passed underneath ingulfed; for God had thrown
6976,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"That mountain, as his garden mould, high raised"
6977,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Upon the rapid current, which, through veins"
6978,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Of porous earth with kindly thirst up-drawn,"
6979,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Rose a fresh fountain, and with many a rill"
6980,THE PLANET EARTH[14],Watered the garden; thence united fell
6981,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Down the steep glade, and met the nether flood,"
6982,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Which from his darksome passage now appears,"
6983,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"And now, divided into four main streams,"
6984,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Runs diverse, wandering many a famous realm"
6985,THE PLANET EARTH[14],And country whereof here needs no account;
6986,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"But rather to tell how, if Art could tell"
6987,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"How, from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks,"
6988,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Boiling on orient-pearl and sands of gold,"
6989,THE PLANET EARTH[14],With mazy error under pendent shades
6990,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Ran nectar, visiting each plant, and fed"
6991,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Flowers worthy of Paradise, which not nice Art"
6992,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"In beds and curious knots, but Nature boon"
6993,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Poured forth profuse on hill, and dale, and plain,"
6994,THE PLANET EARTH[14],Both where the morning Sun first warmly smote
6995,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"The open field, and where the unpierced shade"
6996,THE PLANET EARTH[14],Imbrowned the noontide bowers.--iv. 205-46.
6997,THE PLANET EARTH[14],
6998,THE PLANET EARTH[14],Milton's description of Paradise is not less remarkable in its way than
6999,THE PLANET EARTH[14],the lurid scenes depicted by him in Pandemonium. The versatility of his
7000,THE PLANET EARTH[14],poetic genius is nowhere more apparent than in the charming pastoral
7001,THE PLANET EARTH[14],verse contained in this part of his poem. The poet has lavished the
7002,THE PLANET EARTH[14],whole wealth of his luxuriant imagination in his description of Eden and
7003,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"blissful Paradise with its 'vernal airs' and 'gentle gales,' its verdant"
7004,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"meads, and murmuring streams, 'rolling on orient-pearl and sands of"
7005,THE PLANET EARTH[14],gold;' its stately trees laden with blossom and fruit; its spicy groves
7006,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"and shady bowers, over which there breathed the eternal Spring."
7007,THE PLANET EARTH[14],
7008,THE PLANET EARTH[14],In Book IX. Satan expresses himself in an eloquent apostrophe to the
7009,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"primitive Earth, over which he previously wandered for seven days--"
7010,THE PLANET EARTH[14],
7011,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"O Earth, how like to Heaven, if not preferred"
7012,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"More justly, seat worthier of gods, as built"
7013,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"With second thoughts, reforming what was old!"
7014,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"For what God, after better, worse would build?"
7015,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Terrestrial Heaven, danced round by other Heavens,"
7016,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"That shine, yet bear their bright officious lamps,"
7017,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Light above light, for thee alone, as seems,"
7018,THE PLANET EARTH[14],In thee concentring all their precious beams
7019,THE PLANET EARTH[14],Of sacred influence! As God in Heaven
7020,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Is centre, yet extends to all, so thou"
7021,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Centring receiv'st from all those orbs; in thee,"
7022,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Not in themselves, all their known virtue appears,"
7023,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Productive in herb, plant, and nobler birth"
7024,THE PLANET EARTH[14],Of creatures animate with gradual life
7025,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Of growth, sense, reason, all summed up in Man,"
7026,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"With what delight I could have walked thee round,"
7027,THE PLANET EARTH[14],If I could joy in aught--sweet interchange
7028,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Of hill and valley, rivers, woods, and plains,"
7029,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Now land, now sea, and shores with forest crowned,"
7030,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"Rocks, dens, and caves.--ix. 99-118."
7031,THE PLANET EARTH[14],
7032,THE PLANET EARTH[14],Though it is impossible to regard the Earth as possessing the importance
7033,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"ascribed to it by the ancient Ptolemaists; nevertheless, our globe is a"
7034,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"great and mighty world, and appears to be one of the most favourably"
7035,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"situated of all the planets, being neither near the Sun nor yet very far"
7036,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"distant from the orb; and although, when compared with the universe, it"
7037,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"is no more than a leaf on a tree in the midst of a vast forest; still,"
7038,THE PLANET EARTH[14],"it is not the least important among other circling worlds, and"
7039,THE PLANET EARTH[14],unfailingly fulfils the part allotted to it in the great scheme of
7040,THE PLANET EARTH[14],creation.
7041,THE PLANET EARTH[14],
7042,THE PLANET EARTH[14],
7043,THE PLANET HESPERUS,THE PLANET HESPERUS
7044,THE PLANET HESPERUS,
7045,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"This is the beautiful morning and evening star, the peerless planet that"
7046,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"ushers in the twilight and the dawn, the harbinger of day and unrivalled"
7047,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"queen of the evening. Venus, called after the Roman goddess of Love, and"
7048,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"also identified with the Greek Aphrodite of ideal beauty, is the name by"
7049,THE PLANET HESPERUS,which the planet is popularly known; but Milton does not so designate
7050,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"it, and the name 'Venus' is not found in 'Paradise Lost.' The ancients"
7051,THE PLANET HESPERUS,called it Lucifer and Phosphor when it shone as a morning star before
7052,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"sunrise, and Hesperus and Vesper when it became visible after sunset. It"
7053,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"is the most lustrous of all the planets, and at times its brilliancy is"
7054,THE PLANET HESPERUS,so marked as to throw a distinct shadow at night.
7055,THE PLANET HESPERUS,
7056,THE PLANET HESPERUS,Venus is the second planet in order from the Sun. Its orbit lies between
7057,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"that of Mercury and the Earth, and in form approaches nearer to a circle"
7058,THE PLANET HESPERUS,than that of any of the other planets. It travels round the Sun in
7059,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"224·7 days, at a mean distance of 67,000,000 miles, and with an average"
7060,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"velocity of 80,000 miles an hour. Its period of rotation is unknown. By"
7061,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"the observation of dusky spots on its surface, it has been surmised that"
7062,THE PLANET HESPERUS,the planet completes a revolution on its axis in 23-1/4 hours; but other
7063,THE PLANET HESPERUS,observers doubt this and are inclined to believe that it always presents
7064,THE PLANET HESPERUS,the same face to the Sun. When at inferior conjunction Venus approaches
7065,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"nearer to the Earth than any other planet, its distance then being"
7066,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"27,000,000 miles. Its greatest elongation varies from 45° to 47° 12´; it"
7067,THE PLANET HESPERUS,therefore can never be much more than three hours above the horizon
7068,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"before sunrise, or after sunset. Venus is a morning star when passing"
7069,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"from inferior to superior conjunction, and during the other half of its"
7070,THE PLANET HESPERUS,synodical period it is an evening star. The planet attains its greatest
7071,THE PLANET HESPERUS,brilliancy at an elongation 40° west or east of the Sun--five weeks
7072,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"before and after inferior conjunction. It is at these periods, when at"
7073,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"its greatest brilliancy, that it casts a shadow at night."
7074,THE PLANET HESPERUS,
7075,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"Though so pleasing an object to the unaided eye, Venus, when observed"
7076,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"with the telescope, is often a source of disappointment--this is on"
7077,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"account of its dazzling brilliancy, which renders any accurate"
7078,THE PLANET HESPERUS,definition of its surface impossible. Sir John Herschel writes: 'The
7079,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"intense lustre of its illuminated part dazzles the sight, and"
7080,THE PLANET HESPERUS,exaggerates every imperfection of the telescope; yet we see clearly that
7081,THE PLANET HESPERUS,its surface is not mottled over with permanent spots like the Moon; we
7082,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"notice in it neither mountains nor shadows, but a uniform brightness, in"
7083,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"which sometimes we may indeed fancy, or perhaps more than fancy,"
7084,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"brighter or obscurer portions, but can seldom or never rest fully"
7085,THE PLANET HESPERUS,satisfied of the fact.' It is believed that the surface of the planet is
7086,THE PLANET HESPERUS,invisible on account of the existence of a cloud-laden atmosphere by
7087,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"which it is enveloped, and which may serve as a protection against the"
7088,THE PLANET HESPERUS,intense glare of the sunshine and heat poured down by the not
7089,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"far-distant Sun. Schröter, a German astronomer, believed that he saw"
7090,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"lofty mountains on the surface of the planet, but their existence has"
7091,THE PLANET HESPERUS,not been confirmed by any other observer. The Sun if viewed from Venus
7092,THE PLANET HESPERUS,would have a diameter nearly half as large again as when seen from the
7093,THE PLANET HESPERUS,Earth; it is therefore probable that the planet is subjected to a much
7094,THE PLANET HESPERUS,higher temperature than what is experienced on our globe.
7095,THE PLANET HESPERUS,
7096,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"The phases of Venus are similar to those exhibited by the Moon, and are"
7097,THE PLANET HESPERUS,caused by a change in position of the illumined hemisphere of the planet
7098,THE PLANET HESPERUS,with regard to the Earth. At superior conjunction the whole enlightened
7099,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"disc of the planet is turned towards the Earth, but is invisible by"
7100,THE PLANET HESPERUS,being lost in the Sun's rays. Shortly before or after it arrives at this
7101,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"point, its form is gibbous, the illumined portion being less than a"
7102,THE PLANET HESPERUS,circle but greater than a semi-circle. At its greatest elongation west
7103,THE PLANET HESPERUS,or east of the Sun the planet resembles the Moon in quadrature--a half
7104,THE PLANET HESPERUS,moon--and between those points and inferior conjunction it is visible
7105,THE PLANET HESPERUS,as a beautiful crescent. It becomes narrower and sharper as it
7106,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"approaches inferior conjunction, until it resembles a curved luminous"
7107,THE PLANET HESPERUS,thread prior to its disappearance at the conjunction. After having
7108,THE PLANET HESPERUS,passed this point it reappears on the other side of the Sun as the
7109,THE PLANET HESPERUS,morning star.
7110,THE PLANET HESPERUS,
7111,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"It would be only natural to imagine that this peerless orb, the most"
7112,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"beautiful and lustrous of the planets, upon which men have gazed with"
7113,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"longing admiration, and designated the emblem of 'all beauty and all"
7114,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"love,' should have impressed Milton's poetical imagination with its"
7115,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"charming appearance, and stimulated the flow of his captivating muse. He"
7116,THE PLANET HESPERUS,addresses the orb as
7117,THE PLANET HESPERUS,
7118,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"Fairest of Stars, last in the train of night,"
7119,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"If better thou belong not to the dawn,"
7120,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"Sure pledge of day, that crown'st the smiling morn"
7121,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"With thy bright circlet, praise Him in thy sphere"
7122,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"While day arises, that sweet hour of prime.--v. 166-70."
7123,THE PLANET HESPERUS,
7124,THE PLANET HESPERUS,In these lines the poet alludes to Venus as the morning star.
7125,THE PLANET HESPERUS,
7126,THE PLANET HESPERUS,In the other passages in his poem Milton associates the planet sometimes
7127,THE PLANET HESPERUS,with the morning and at other times with the evening--
7128,THE PLANET HESPERUS,
7129,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"His countenance, as the Morning Star that guides"
7130,THE PLANET HESPERUS,The starry flock.--v. 708-709.
7131,THE PLANET HESPERUS,
7132,THE PLANET HESPERUS,Or if the Star of Evening and the Moon
7133,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring"
7134,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"Silence, and Sleep listening to thee will watch.--vii. 104-106."
7135,THE PLANET HESPERUS,
7136,THE PLANET HESPERUS,And hence the morning planet gilds her horns.--vii. 366.
7137,THE PLANET HESPERUS,
7138,THE PLANET HESPERUS,The Sun was sunk and after him the Star
7139,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"Of Hesperus, whose office is to bring"
7140,THE PLANET HESPERUS,"Twilight upon the Earth, short arbiter"
7141,THE PLANET HESPERUS,Twixt day and night.--ix. 47-50.
7142,THE PLANET HESPERUS,
7143,THE PLANET HESPERUS,and bid haste the Evening Star
7144,THE PLANET HESPERUS,On his hill top to light the bridal lamp.--viii. 519-20.
7145,THE PLANET HESPERUS,
7146,THE PLANET HESPERUS,Milton knew of the phases of Venus and was aware that at certain times
7147,THE PLANET HESPERUS,the planet was visible in the telescope as a beautiful crescent. The
7148,THE PLANET HESPERUS,line in which he mentions her as gilding her horns is an allusion to
7149,THE PLANET HESPERUS,this appearance of Venus.

7152,THE PLEIADES,THE PLEIADES
7153,THE PLEIADES,
7154,THE PLEIADES,The beautiful cluster of the Pleiades or Seven Sisters has been regarded
7155,THE PLEIADES,with hallowed veneration from time immemorial. The happy influences
7156,THE PLEIADES,believed to be shed down upon the Earth by those stars and their close
7157,THE PLEIADES,association with human destinies have rendered them objects of almost
7158,THE PLEIADES,sacred interest among the different races of mankind. In every region of
7159,THE PLEIADES,"the globe and in every clime, among civilised nations and savage"
7160,THE PLEIADES,"fetish-worshipping tribes, the same benign influences were ascribed to"
7161,THE PLEIADES,the stars which form this interesting group.
7162,THE PLEIADES,
7163,THE PLEIADES,In Greek mythology they were known as the seven daughters of Atlas and
7164,THE PLEIADES,Pleione. Different versions are given of their fate. By some writers it
7165,THE PLEIADES,is said they died from grief in consequence of the death of their
7166,THE PLEIADES,"sisters, the Hyades, or on account of the fate of their father, who,"
7167,THE PLEIADES,"for treason, was condemned by Zeus to bear on his head and hands the"
7168,THE PLEIADES,"vault of heaven, on the mountains of north-west Africa which bear his"
7169,THE PLEIADES,"name. According to others they were the companions of Diana, and, in"
7170,THE PLEIADES,"order to escape from Orion, by whom they were pursued, the gods"
7171,THE PLEIADES,translated them to the sky.
7172,THE PLEIADES,
7173,THE PLEIADES,All writers agree in saying that after their death or translation they
7174,THE PLEIADES,"were transformed into stars. Their names are Alcyone, Electra, Maia,"
7175,THE PLEIADES,"Merope, Sterope, Taygeta, and Celaeno. The seventh Atlantid is said to"
7176,THE PLEIADES,"be the 'lost Pleiad,' but it can be perceived without difficulty by a"
7177,THE PLEIADES,person possessing good eyesight. In the book of Job there is a beautiful
7178,THE PLEIADES,allusion to the Pleiades (chap. xxxviii.) when God speaks out of the
7179,THE PLEIADES,whirlwind and asks the patriarch to answer Him--
7180,THE PLEIADES,
7181,THE PLEIADES,"Canst thou bind the sweet influences of the Pleiades, or loose the"
7182,THE PLEIADES,bands of Orion?
7183,THE PLEIADES,Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide
7184,THE PLEIADES,Arcturus with his sons?
7185,THE PLEIADES,Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion
7186,THE PLEIADES,thereof in the earth?
7187,THE PLEIADES,
7188,THE PLEIADES,Admiral Smyth says that this noble passage is more correctly rendered as
7189,THE PLEIADES,follows:
7190,THE PLEIADES,
7191,THE PLEIADES,Canst thou bind the delightful teemings of Cheemah?
7192,THE PLEIADES,Or the contractions of Chesil canst thou open?
7193,THE PLEIADES,Canst thou draw forth Mazzaroth in his season
7194,THE PLEIADES,Or Ayeesh and his sons canst thou guide?
7195,THE PLEIADES,
7196,THE PLEIADES,He writes: 'In this very early description of the cardinal
7197,THE PLEIADES,"constellations, _Cheemah_ denotes Taurus with the Pleiades; _Chesil_ is"
7198,THE PLEIADES,"Scorpio; Mazzaroth is Sirius in ""the chambers of the south;"" and Ayeesh"
7199,THE PLEIADES,"the Greater Bear, the Hebrew word signifying a _bier_, which was shaped"
7200,THE PLEIADES,"by the four well-known bright stars, while the three forming the tail"
7201,THE PLEIADES,were considered as children attending a funeral.' The Greeks at an early
7202,THE PLEIADES,"period were attracted by this cluster of stars, and Hesiod alludes to"
7203,THE PLEIADES,them in his writings. One passage converted into rhyme reads as follows:
7204,THE PLEIADES,
7205,THE PLEIADES,"There is a time when forty days they lie,"
7206,THE PLEIADES,"And forty nights, conceal'd from human eye;"
7207,THE PLEIADES,"But in the course of the revolving year,"
7208,THE PLEIADES,"When the swain sharps the scythe, again appear."
7209,THE PLEIADES,
7210,THE PLEIADES,Their heliacal rising was considered a favourable time for setting out
7211,THE PLEIADES,"on a voyage, and their midnight culmination, which occurred shortly"
7212,THE PLEIADES,"after the middle of November, was celebrated by some nations with"
7213,THE PLEIADES,festivals and public ceremonies. Considerable diversity of opinion
7214,THE PLEIADES,existed among the ancients with regard to the number of stars which
7215,THE PLEIADES,constitute this group. It was affirmed by some that only six were
7216,THE PLEIADES,"visible, whilst others maintained that seven could be seen. Ovid writes:"
7217,THE PLEIADES,
7218,THE PLEIADES,"Quae septem dici, sex tamen esse solent."
7219,THE PLEIADES,
7220,THE PLEIADES,Homer and Attalus mention six; Hipparchus and Aratus seven. The legend
7221,THE PLEIADES,"with regard to the lost Pleiad would seem to indicate that, during a"
7222,THE PLEIADES,"period in the past, the star possessed a superior brilliancy and was"
7223,THE PLEIADES,more distinctly visible than it is at the present time. This may have
7224,THE PLEIADES,"been so, for, should it belong to the class of variable stars, there"
7225,THE PLEIADES,"would be a periodic ebb and flow of its light, by which its fluctuating"
7226,THE PLEIADES,brilliance could be explained. When looked at directly only six stars
7227,THE PLEIADES,"can be seen in the group, but should the eye be turned sideways more"
7228,THE PLEIADES,than this number become visible. Several observers have counted as many
7229,THE PLEIADES,"as ten or twelve, and it is stated by Kepler that his tutor, Maestlin,"
7230,THE PLEIADES,was able to enumerate fourteen stars and mapped eleven in their relative
7231,THE PLEIADES,positions. With telescopic aid the number is largely increased--Galileo
7232,THE PLEIADES,"observed thirty-six with his instrument and Hooke, in 1664, counted"
7233,THE PLEIADES,seventy-eight. Large modern telescopes bring into view several thousand
7234,THE PLEIADES,stars in this region.
7235,THE PLEIADES,
7236,THE PLEIADES,The Pleiades are situated at a profound distance in space. Their light
7237,THE PLEIADES,"period is estimated at 250 years, indicating a distance of 1,500"
7238,THE PLEIADES,billions of miles. Our Sun if thus far removed would be reduced to a
7239,THE PLEIADES,"tenth-magnitude star. 'There can be little doubt,' says Miss Agnes"
7240,THE PLEIADES,"Clerke, 'that the solar brilliancy is surpassed by sixty to seventy of"
7241,THE PLEIADES,the Pleiades. And it must be in some cases enormously surpassed; by
7242,THE PLEIADES,"Alcyone 1,000, by Electra 480, by Maia nearly 400 times. Sirius itself"
7243,THE PLEIADES,takes a subordinate rank when compared with the five most brilliant
7244,THE PLEIADES,"members of a group, the real magnificence of which we can thus in some"
7245,THE PLEIADES,degree apprehend.' This is the only star cluster which can be perceived
7246,THE PLEIADES,"to be moving in space, or which has an ascertained common proper motion."
7247,THE PLEIADES,Its constituents form a magnificent system in which the stars bear a
7248,THE PLEIADES,"mutual relationship to each other, and perform intricate internal"
7249,THE PLEIADES,"revolutions, whilst they in systemic union drift along through the"
7250,THE PLEIADES,depths of space. There are two allusions to the Pleiades in 'Paradise
7251,THE PLEIADES,"Lost.' In describing the path of the newly created Sun, Milton"
7252,THE PLEIADES,introduces them as indicative of the joyfulness associated with the
7253,THE PLEIADES,birth of the Universe--
7254,THE PLEIADES,
7255,THE PLEIADES,"First in his east the glorious lamp was seen,"
7256,THE PLEIADES,"Regent of day, and all the horizon round"
7257,THE PLEIADES,"Invested with bright rays, jocund to run"
7258,THE PLEIADES,His longitude through heaven's high road; the grey
7259,THE PLEIADES,"Dawn, and the Pleiades before him danced,"
7260,THE PLEIADES,Shedding sweet influence.--vii. 370-75.
7261,THE PLEIADES,
7262,THE PLEIADES,It was believed that the Earth was created in the spring; and towards
7263,THE PLEIADES,the end of April this group rises a little before the Sun and precedes
7264,THE PLEIADES,"him in his course, 'shedding sweet influences.' The ancients believed"
7265,THE PLEIADES,that the good or evil influences of the stars were exercised not in the
7266,THE PLEIADES,"night but during the day, when their rays mingled with those of the Sun."
7267,THE PLEIADES,The pernicious influence of the Dog-star is mentioned by Latin writers
7268,THE PLEIADES,"as being most pronounced during the dog-days, at the end of summer and"
7269,THE PLEIADES,"commencement of autumn, the time of the heliacal rising of this star."
7270,THE PLEIADES,
7271,THE PLEIADES,"The other allusion to the Pleiades is in Book X., line 673, where"
7272,THE PLEIADES,"Milton, in describing the altered path of the Sun consequent upon the"
7273,THE PLEIADES,"Fall, mentions how the orb travels through Taurus with the Seven"
7274,THE PLEIADES,"Atlantic Sisters--the seven daughters of Atlas, the Pleiades, which are"
7275,THE PLEIADES,situated on the shoulder of the animal representing this zodiacal
7276,THE PLEIADES,constellation.

7278,THE PLEIADES,
7279,THE GALAXY,THE GALAXY
7280,THE GALAXY,
7281,THE GALAXY,The Galaxy or Milky Way is the great luminous zone encircling the
7282,THE GALAXY,"heavens, which can be seen extending across the sky from horizon to"
7283,THE GALAXY,horizon. Its diffused nebulous appearance caused the ancients much
7284,THE GALAXY,"perplexity, and many quaint opinions were hazarded as to the nature of"
7285,THE GALAXY,this celestial highway; but the mystery associated with it was not
7286,THE GALAXY,solved until Galileo directed his newly invented telescope to this
7287,THE GALAXY,"lucent object, when, to his intense delight, he discovered that it"
7288,THE GALAXY,consists of myriads of stars--millions upon millions of suns so distant
7289,THE GALAXY,"as to be individually indistinguishable to ordinary vision, and so"
7290,THE GALAXY,"closely aggregated, that their blended light gives rise to the milky"
7291,THE GALAXY,luminosity signified by its name. This stelliferous zone almost
7292,THE GALAXY,"completely encircles the sphere, which it divides into two nearly equal"
7293,THE GALAXY,"parts, and is inclined at an angle of 63° to the celestial equator. In"
7294,THE GALAXY,"Centaurus it divides into two portions, one indistinct and of"
7295,THE GALAXY,"interrupted continuity, the other bright and well defined; these, after"
7296,THE GALAXY,"remaining apart for 120°, reunite in Cygnus. The Milky Way is of"
7297,THE GALAXY,irregular outline and varies in breadth from 5° to 16°; it intersects
7298,THE GALAXY,"the equinoctial in the constellations Monoceros and Aquila, and"
7299,THE GALAXY,approaches in Cassiopeia to within 27° of the north pole of the heavens;
7300,THE GALAXY,an equal distance intervenes between it and the south pole. Its poles
7301,THE GALAXY,are in Coma Bernices and Cetus. The stars in the galactic tract are very
7302,THE GALAXY,unevenly distributed; in some of its richest regions as many stars as
7303,THE GALAXY,are visible to the naked eye on a clear night have been counted within
7304,THE GALAXY,the space of a square degree. In other parts they are much less
7305,THE GALAXY,"numerous, and there have been observed besides, adjacent to the most"
7306,THE GALAXY,"luminous portions of the zone, dark intervals and winding channels"
7307,THE GALAXY,almost entirely devoid of stars. An instance of this kind occurs in the
7308,THE GALAXY,"constellation of the Southern Cross, where there exists in a rich"
7309,THE GALAXY,"stellar region a large oval-shaped dark vacuity, 8° by 5° in extent,"
7310,THE GALAXY,"that appears to be almost entirely denuded of stars. In looking at it,"
7311,THE GALAXY,an impression is created that one is gazing into an empty void of space
7312,THE GALAXY,far beyond the Milky Way. This gulf of Cimmerian darkness was called by
7313,THE GALAXY,"early navigators the Coal Sack. Similar dark spaces, though not of such"
7314,THE GALAXY,"magnitude, are seen in Ophiuchus, Scorpio, and Cygnus."
7315,THE GALAXY,
7316,THE GALAXY,"The Galaxy, when viewed with a powerful telescope, is found to consist"
7317,THE GALAXY,"of congeries of stars, vast stellar aggregations, great luminous tracts"
7318,THE GALAXY,"resolvable into clouds of stars of overpowering magnificence, superb"
7319,THE GALAXY,"clusters of various orders, and convoluted nebulous streams wandering"
7320,THE GALAXY,"'with mazy error' among 'islands of light and lakes of darkness,'"
7321,THE GALAXY,resolved by the telescope into banks of shining worlds. The concourses
7322,THE GALAXY,of stars which enter into the formation of this wonderful zone exhibit
7323,THE GALAXY,in a marvellous degree the amazing profusion in which these orbs exist
7324,THE GALAXY,in certain regions of space; yet those multitudes of stars perform their
7325,THE GALAXY,"motions in harmonious unison and in orderly array, and by their mutual"
7326,THE GALAXY,attraction sustain the dynamical equilibrium of this stupendous galactic
7327,THE GALAXY,"ring, the diameter of which, according to one authority, is not"
7328,THE GALAXY,"traversed by light in less than 13,000 years."
7329,THE GALAXY,
7330,THE GALAXY,[Illustration: FIG. 8.--A Portion of the Milky Way.]
7331,THE GALAXY,
7332,THE GALAXY,"Sir William Herschel, to whom we are indebted for most of what we know"
7333,THE GALAXY,"of the Milky Way, commenced a series of observations in 1785 with the"
7334,THE GALAXY,object of acquiring a knowledge of the structure of the sidereal
7335,THE GALAXY,"heavens. In the accomplishment of this object, to which he devoted a"
7336,THE GALAXY,"considerable part of his life, he undertook a systematic survey of that"
7337,THE GALAXY,portion of the Galaxy which is visible in the Northern Hemisphere. By a
7338,THE GALAXY,"method called star-gauging, which consisted in the enumeration of the"
7339,THE GALAXY,stars in each successive telescopic field as the instrument moved slowly
7340,THE GALAXY,"over the region under observation, he found that the depth of the star"
7341,THE GALAXY,strata could be approximately ascertained by counting the stars along
7342,THE GALAXY,the line of vision; those were most numerous where the visual line
7343,THE GALAXY,appeared of the greatest length and fewest in number where it was
7344,THE GALAXY,shortest. Herschel perceived the internal structure of the Galaxy to be
7345,THE GALAXY,"exceedingly intricate and complex, and that it embraced within its"
7346,THE GALAXY,"confines an endless variety of systems, clusters, and groups, branches,"
7347,THE GALAXY,"sprays, arches, loops, and streaming filaments of stars, all of which"
7348,THE GALAXY,"combined to form this luminous zone. 'It is indeed,' says a well-known"
7349,THE GALAXY,"astronomer, 'only to the most careless glance, or when viewed through an"
7350,THE GALAXY,"atmosphere of imperfect transparency, that the Milky Way seems a"
7351,THE GALAXY,"continuous zone. Let the naked eye rest thoughtfully on any part of it,"
7352,THE GALAXY,"and, if circumstances be favourable, it will stand out rather as an"
7353,THE GALAXY,accumulation of patches and streams of light of every conceivable
7354,THE GALAXY,"variety of form and brightness, now side by side, now heaped on each"
7355,THE GALAXY,"other; again spanning across dark spaces, intertwining and forming a"
7356,THE GALAXY,most curious and complex network; and at other times darting off into
7357,THE GALAXY,the neighbouring skies in branches of capricious length and shape which
7358,THE GALAXY,"gradually thin away and disappear.' Sir John Herschel, who was occupied"
7359,THE GALAXY,for four years at the Cape of Good Hope in exploring the celestial
7360,THE GALAXY,"regions of the Southern Hemisphere, describes the coming on of the Milky"
7361,THE GALAXY,Way as seen in his 20-foot reflector. He first remarks 'that all the
7362,THE GALAXY,"stars visible to us, whether by unassisted vision or through the best"
7363,THE GALAXY,"telescopes, belong to and form part of a vast stratum or considerably"
7364,THE GALAXY,flattened and unsymmetrical congeries of stars in which our system is
7365,THE GALAXY,"deeply and eccentrically plunged; and, moreover, situated near a point"
7366,THE GALAXY,where the stratum bifurcates or spreads itself out into two sheets.' 'As
7367,THE GALAXY,the main body of the Milky Way comes on the frequency and variety of
7368,THE GALAXY,those masses (nebulous) increases; here the Milky Way is composed of
7369,THE GALAXY,"separate or slight or strongly connected clouds of semi-nebulous light,"
7370,THE GALAXY,"and, as the telescope moves, the appearance is that of clouds passing in"
7371,THE GALAXY,"a scud, as sailors call it.' The Milky Way is like sand, not strewed"
7372,THE GALAXY,"evenly as with a sieve, but as if flung down by handfuls (and both hands"
7373,THE GALAXY,"at once), leaving dark intervals, and all consisting of stars of the"
7374,THE GALAXY,"fourteenth, sixteenth, twentieth magnitudes down to nebulosity, in a"
7375,THE GALAXY,"most astonishing manner. After an interval of comparative poverty, the"
7376,THE GALAXY,"same phenomenon, and even more remarkable, I cannot say it is nebulous,"
7377,THE GALAXY,"it is all resolved, but the stars are inconceivably numerous and minute;"
7378,THE GALAXY,there must be millions and all almost equally massed together. Yet they
7379,THE GALAXY,nowhere run to nuclei or clusters much brighter in the middle. Towards
7380,THE GALAXY,the end of the seventeenth hour (Right Ascension) the globular clusters
7381,THE GALAXY,"begin to come in; they consist of stars of excessive minuteness, but"
7382,THE GALAXY,"yet not more so than the ground of the Milky Way, on which not only they"
7383,THE GALAXY,"appear projected, but of which it is very probable they form a part."
7384,THE GALAXY,'From the foregoing analysis of the telescopic aspect of the Milky Way
7385,THE GALAXY,"in this interesting region, I think it can hardly be doubted that it"
7386,THE GALAXY,"consists of portions differing exceedingly in distance, but brought by"
7387,THE GALAXY,"the effect of projection into the same, or nearly the same, visual line;"
7388,THE GALAXY,"in particular, that at the anterior edge of what we have called the main"
7389,THE GALAXY,"stream, we see foreshortened a vast and illimitable area scattered over"
7390,THE GALAXY,with discontinuous masses and aggregates of stars in the manner of the
7391,THE GALAXY,"cumuli of a mackerel sky, rather than of a stratum of regular thickness"
7392,THE GALAXY,and homogeneous formation.'
7393,THE GALAXY,
7394,THE GALAXY,The profound distance at which the stars of the Galaxy are situated in
7395,THE GALAXY,space precludes the possibility of our obtaining any definite knowledge
7396,THE GALAXY,of their magnitude and of the extent of the intervals by which they are
7397,THE GALAXY,"separated from each other, nor can we learn anything of the details"
7398,THE GALAXY,associated with the systems and combinations into which they enter. It
7399,THE GALAXY,is believed that the majority of the stars in the Milky Way equal or
7400,THE GALAXY,surpass the Sun in brilliancy and splendour. They are tenth to fifteenth
7401,THE GALAXY,"magnitude stars; now, the Sun at the distance indicated by these"
7402,THE GALAXY,magnitudes would in the telescope appear a much fainter object; he would
7403,THE GALAXY,"not reach the fifteenth magnitude. Consequently, the galactic stars are"
7404,THE GALAXY,regarded as his peers or superiors in magnitude and brilliancy. Those
7405,THE GALAXY,myriads of suns are all in motion--in nature a stationary body is
7406,THE GALAXY,unknown--and they are sufficiently far apart so as not to be unduly
7407,THE GALAXY,influenced by their mutual gravitational attraction; a distance perhaps
7408,THE GALAXY,equal to that which separates our Sun from the nearest fixed star may
7409,THE GALAXY,intervene between each of those orbs. In the deepest recesses of the
7410,THE GALAXY,"Milky Way, Sir William Herschel was able to count 500 stars receding in"
7411,THE GALAXY,regular order behind each other; between each there existed an interval
7412,THE GALAXY,"of space, probably not less extensive than the interstellar spaces among"
7413,THE GALAXY,the stars by which we are surrounded.
7414,THE GALAXY,
7415,THE GALAXY,The richest galactic regions in the Northern Hemisphere are found in
7416,THE GALAXY,"Perseus, Cygnus, and Aquila. Night after night could be spent in"
7417,THE GALAXY,sweeping the telescope over fields where the stars can be seen in
7418,THE GALAXY,"amazing profusion. In the interval of a quarter of an hour, Sir William"
7419,THE GALAXY,"Herschel observed 116,000 stars pass before him in the telescope, and on"
7420,THE GALAXY,"another occasion he perceived 258,000 stars in the space of forty-one"
7421,THE GALAXY,minutes. In the constellation of the Swan there is a region about 5° in
7422,THE GALAXY,"breadth which contains 331,000 stars. Photography reveals in a"
7423,THE GALAXY,remarkable manner the amazing richness of this stelliferous zone; the
7424,THE GALAXY,"impress of the stars on the sensitive plate of the camera, in some"
7425,THE GALAXY,"instances, resembles a shower of descending snowflakes."
7426,THE GALAXY,
7427,THE GALAXY,Though Sir William Herschel was able to fathom the Galaxy in most of its
7428,THE GALAXY,"tracts, yet there were regions which his great telescopes were unable"
7429,THE GALAXY,to penetrate entirely through. In Cepheus there is a spot where he
7430,THE GALAXY,observed the stars become 'gradually less till they escape the eye so
7431,THE GALAXY,that appearances here favour the idea of a succeeding more distant
7432,THE GALAXY,"clustering part.' He perceived another in Scorpio 'where, through the"
7433,THE GALAXY,"hollows and deep recesses of its complicated structure, we behold what"
7434,THE GALAXY,has all the appearance of a wide and indefinitely prolonged area strewed
7435,THE GALAXY,over with discontinuous masses and clouds of stars which the telescope
7436,THE GALAXY,"at length refuses to analyse.' The Great Cluster in Perseus, which lies"
7437,THE GALAXY,"in the Milky Way, also baffled the penetrative capacity of Herschel's"
7438,THE GALAXY,instruments. We cannot help quoting Professor Nichol's description of
7439,THE GALAXY,Herschel's observation of this remarkable object. He says: 'In the Milky
7440,THE GALAXY,"Way, thronged all over with splendours, there is one portion not"
7441,THE GALAXY,"unnoticed by the general observer, the spot in the sword-hand of"
7442,THE GALAXY,Perseus. That spot shows no stars to the naked eye; the milky light
7443,THE GALAXY,which glorifies it comes from regions to which unaided we cannot pierce.
7444,THE GALAXY,But to a telescope of considerable power the space appears lighted up
7445,THE GALAXY,with unnumbered orbs; and these pass on through the depths of the
7446,THE GALAXY,"infinite, until, even to that penetrating glass, they escape all"
7447,THE GALAXY,"scrutiny, withdrawing into regions unvisited by its power. Shall we"
7448,THE GALAXY,"adventure into these deeper retirements? Then, assume an instrument of"
7449,THE GALAXY,"higher efficacy, and lo! the change is only repeated; those scarce"
7450,THE GALAXY,"observed before appear as large orbs, and, behind, a new series begins,"
7451,THE GALAXY,"shading gradually away, leading towards farther mysteries! The"
7452,THE GALAXY,"illustrious Herschel penetrated on one occasion into this spot, until he"
7453,THE GALAXY,found himself among depths whose light could not have reached him in
7454,THE GALAXY,"much less than 4,000 years; no marvel that he withdrew from the pursuit,"
7455,THE GALAXY,conceiving that such abysses must be endless!' The Milky Way may be
7456,THE GALAXY,"regarded as a universe by itself, and our Sun as one of its myriad"
7457,THE GALAXY,stars.
7458,THE GALAXY,
7459,THE GALAXY,"Milton was aware of the stellar constitution of the Milky Way, which was"
7460,THE GALAXY,one of Galileo's discoveries. The poet gives a singularly accurate
7461,THE GALAXY,"description of this luminous path, which he glorifies as the way by"
7462,THE GALAXY,which the Deity returned up to the Heaven of Heavens after He finished
7463,THE GALAXY,His great work of creation--
7464,THE GALAXY,
7465,THE GALAXY,So sung
7466,THE GALAXY,"The glorious train ascending: He through Heaven,"
7467,THE GALAXY,"That opened wide her blazing portals, led"
7468,THE GALAXY,To God's eternal house direct the way--
7469,THE GALAXY,"A broad and ample road, whose dust is gold,"
7470,THE GALAXY,"And pavement stars, as stars to thee appear"
7471,THE GALAXY,"Seen in the Galaxy, that Milky Way"
7472,THE GALAXY,Which nightly as a circling zone thou seest
7473,THE GALAXY,Powdered with stars.--vii. 573-81.

7476,COMETS,COMETS
7477,COMETS,
7478,COMETS,Records of the appearance of these remarkable objects have been handed
7479,COMETS,"down from earliest times; and when one of those mysterious visitors,"
7480,COMETS,"travelling from out the depths of space, became visible in our skies, it"
7481,COMETS,was regarded with apprehension and dread as betokening the occurrence
7482,COMETS,of calamities and direful events among the nations of the Earth.
7483,COMETS,
7484,COMETS,"The word comet is derived from the Greek {komê}, signifying"
7485,COMETS,"'hair,' to which the hazy, luminous appearance of those objects bears"
7486,COMETS,some resemblance. A comet consists of a bright central part called the
7487,COMETS,_nucleus_; this is surrounded by layers of nebulous matter called the
7488,COMETS,"_coma_, and both combined form the _head_, from which a long appendage"
7489,COMETS,extends called the _tail_. The nucleus and tail are not essential parts
7490,COMETS,"of a comet, for many have been observed in which both have been wanting."
7491,COMETS,"The tail is frequently very conspicuous, and presents considerable"
7492,COMETS,diversity both as regards its appearance and length. In some comets it
7493,COMETS,"is entirely absent, and in others it has been observed to stretch over"
7494,COMETS,"an arc of sixty or seventy degrees, indicating a length of 100 to 150"
7495,COMETS,"million miles. Sometimes it is straight, and at other times it is curved"
7496,COMETS,at the extremity; it has been observed bifurcated into two branches;
7497,COMETS,"and, on rare occasions, comets have been seen with two or more tails."
7498,COMETS,The tail of a comet is always directed away from the Sun; it increases
7499,COMETS,"in size as the comet approaches the orb, and diminishes as it recedes"
7500,COMETS,from him. This depends upon the degree of heat to which the comet is
7501,COMETS,"exposed, which has the effect of driving off or evaporating some of the"
7502,COMETS,matter composing the head. During the time the comet is travelling round
7503,COMETS,"the Sun there is a continuous emission of this highly attenuated matter,"
7504,COMETS,"which is visible as the tail, but when the comet begins to recede from"
7505,COMETS,the orb and reaches cooler regions of space the tail diminishes in size
7506,COMETS,"as the temperature becomes reduced, and ultimately it disappears."
7507,COMETS,
7508,COMETS,"The appearance of a comet in the sky is often sudden and unexpected, and"
7509,COMETS,one of those erratic wanderers may become visible at any time and in any
7510,COMETS,part of the heavens. It was remarked by Kepler that there are as many
7511,COMETS,comets in the sky as there are fishes in the ocean. This may or may not
7512,COMETS,"be true, for they only become visible when they approach the Sun, and"
7513,COMETS,the time during which they remain so does not usually exceed a few weeks
7514,COMETS,or months. Ancient astronomers were much perplexed with the motions of
7515,COMETS,"comets, which appeared to be much more irregular than those of other"
7516,COMETS,celestial bodies and unconformed to any known laws. Tycho Brahé believed
7517,COMETS,"that comets moved in circular orbits, and Kepler imagined that they"
7518,COMETS,"travelled in straight lines outwards from the Sun. Newton, however, was"
7519,COMETS,able to demonstrate that any conic section can be described about the
7520,COMETS,"Sun consistent with the law of gravitation, and that the orbits of"
7521,COMETS,comets correspond with three of the four sections into which a cone can
7522,COMETS,"be divided. Consequently, they obey the laws of planetary motion. Comets"
7523,COMETS,which move in ellipses of known eccentricity and return with periodical
7524,COMETS,regularity may be regarded as belonging to the solar system. Twenty of
7525,COMETS,"these are known, and eleven of them have more than once passed their"
7526,COMETS,perihelion. Those most familiarly known complete their periods in years
7527,COMETS,"as follows:--Encke's 3·3; Swift's, 5·5; Winnecke's, 5·6; Tempel's, 6;"
7528,COMETS,"Brorsen's, 5·5; Faye's, 7·4; Tuttle's, 13·8, and Halley's, 76. Comets"
7529,COMETS,with parabolic and hyperbolic orbits may be regarded as stray objects
7530,COMETS,"which visit our system once, and depart never to return again. Besides"
7531,COMETS,those already mentioned there are many comets with orbits of such marked
7532,COMETS,eccentricity that their ellipses when near perihelion cannot be
7533,COMETS,"distinguished from parabolæ. The great comets of 1780, 1811, 1843, 1858,"
7534,COMETS,"1861, and 1882 traverse orbits approaching this form, and some of them"
7535,COMETS,require hundreds and thousands of years to accomplish a circuit of their
7536,COMETS,paths.
7537,COMETS,
7538,COMETS,Numerous instances of the appearance of remarkable comets have been
7539,COMETS,recorded in the annals of ancient nations. The earliest records of
7540,COMETS,"comets are by the Chinese, who were careful observers of celestial"
7541,COMETS,phenomena. A comet is said to have appeared at the time of the birth of
7542,COMETS,"Mithridates (134 B.C.), which had a disc as large as that of the Sun; a"
7543,COMETS,great comet also became visible in the heavens about the time of the
7544,COMETS,"death of Julius Cæsar (44 B.C.), and another was seen in the reign of"
7545,COMETS,"Justinian (531 A.D.). A remarkable comet was observed in 1106, and in"
7546,COMETS,"1456, the year in which the Turks obtained possession of Constantinople"
7547,COMETS,"and threatened to overrun Europe, a great comet appeared, which was"
7548,COMETS,regarded by Christendom with ominous forebodings. The celebrated
7549,COMETS,astronomer Halley was the first to predict the return of a comet.
7550,COMETS,"Having become acquainted with Newton's investigations, which showed that"
7551,COMETS,the forms of the orbits of comets were either parabolæ or extremely
7552,COMETS,"elongated ellipses, he subjected the next great comet, which appeared in"
7553,COMETS,"1682, to a series of observations, calculated its orbit, and predicted"
7554,COMETS,that it would return to perihelion in seventy-five or seventy-six years.
7555,COMETS,On referring to past records he discovered that a great comet appeared
7556,COMETS,"in 1607, which pursued a path similar to the one traced out for his"
7557,COMETS,"comet, another was seen in 1531, and one in 1456. Halley perceived that"
7558,COMETS,the intervals between those dates corresponded to a period of about
7559,COMETS,"seventy-six years, the time which he calculated would be required for"
7560,COMETS,his comet to complete a revolution of its orbit. He therefore had no
7561,COMETS,hesitation in predicting that the comet would appear again in 1758.
7562,COMETS,"Halley knew that he would not be alive to witness the event, and alludes"
7563,COMETS,to it in the following sentence: 'Wherefore if it should return
7564,COMETS,"according to our prediction about the year 1758, impartial posterity"
7565,COMETS,will not refuse to acknowledge that this was first discovered by an
7566,COMETS,Englishman.' As the time approached when the comet should be drawing
7567,COMETS,"near to our system, much interest was excited among astronomers, who"
7568,COMETS,would have an opportunity afforded them of testing the accuracy of
7569,COMETS,Halley's prediction. An eminent French mathematician named Clairaut
7570,COMETS,"computed anew, by a method rather different to that adopted by Halley,"
7571,COMETS,the retarding effect of the attraction of the planets upon the speed of
7572,COMETS,"the comet, and arrived at the conclusion that it would reach perihelion"
7573,COMETS,"about the middle of April 1759; but, owing to unknown influences--Uranus"
7574,COMETS,and Neptune not having been discovered--it might be a month before or
7575,COMETS,behind the calculated time. Clairaut made this announcement on November
7576,COMETS,"14, 1758. Astronomers were now intently on the look-out for the comet,"
7577,COMETS,and night after night the sky was swept by telescopes in search of the
7578,COMETS,"expected visitor, which for upwards of seventy years had been pursuing"
7579,COMETS,its solitary path invisible to mortal eyes. But the mental vision of the
7580,COMETS,"mathematician did not fail to follow this celestial object, which was"
7581,COMETS,now announced as being on the confines of our system. The comet was
7582,COMETS,"first observed on December 25, 1758, it soon became conspicuous in the"
7583,COMETS,"heavens, and reached perihelion on March 12, 1759, a month before the"
7584,COMETS,time assigned to it by Clairaut but within the limit of error allowed
7585,COMETS,"for unknown influences. Halley's comet returned again in 1835, and may"
7586,COMETS,be expected about the year 1911. The periodic appearance of this comet
7587,COMETS,has been traced back to the year 1305.
7588,COMETS,
7589,COMETS,The celebrated comet of 1680 was noted as having been the one which
7590,COMETS,afforded Newton an opportunity of making observations which led to his
7591,COMETS,discovery that comets describe orbits round the Sun in conformity with
7592,COMETS,the different sections of a cone. The comet of 1811 was observed for
7593,COMETS,many weeks in the northern heavens as a brilliant object with a
7594,COMETS,beautiful fan-shaped tail; it completes a revolution of its orbit in
7595,COMETS,"about 3,000 years. The comet of 1843 was also a splendid object. It"
7596,COMETS,"possessed a tail 200 million miles in length, and approached within"
7597,COMETS,"32,000 miles of the Sun. The heat to which it was exposed was sufficient"
7598,COMETS,to volatilize the most infusible substances known to exist. Donati's
7599,COMETS,comet of 1858 will be long remembered as one of the most impressive of
7600,COMETS,"celestial spectacles: its tail extended over an area of forty degrees,"
7601,COMETS,"and enveloped the star Arcturus, which could be seen shining through it"
7602,COMETS,"with undiminished brilliancy. Its period is estimated to be 2,100 years."
7603,COMETS,"A great comet appeared in 1861, through the tail of which the Earth"
7604,COMETS,passed without any perceptible effect having resulted. No remarkable
7605,COMETS,"comets have appeared during recent years. In 1880, 1881, and 1882,"
7606,COMETS,"several were observed, and that of 1881 was the first successfully"
7607,COMETS,photographed.
7608,COMETS,
7609,COMETS,Comets consist of cosmical matter which exists in a condition of extreme
7610,COMETS,"tenuity, and especially so in the coma and tail. Sir John Herschel"
7611,COMETS,"described them as almost spiritual in texture, and small stars have been"
7612,COMETS,seen shining through their densest parts without any perceptible
7613,COMETS,diminution of their light. The nucleus is believed to be composed of a
7614,COMETS,"congeries of meteoric fragments, and these, when exposed to the Sun's"
7615,COMETS,"heat, throw off luminous nebulous particles that are swept by some"
7616,COMETS,repulsive force into space and form the appendage known as the tail.
7617,COMETS,Comets may be regarded as celestial objects that are perfectly
7618,COMETS,innocuous. Neither fear nor dread need be apprehended from their visits;
7619,COMETS,"they come to please and instruct, not to injure or destroy."
7620,COMETS,
7621,COMETS,Milton does not fail to introduce into his poem several allusions to
7622,COMETS,"comets, and in doing so expresses the ideas and sentiments which in his"
7623,COMETS,time were associated with those objects.
7624,COMETS,
7625,COMETS,In describing the hostile meeting between Satan and Death before the
7626,COMETS,"Gates of Hell, he writes:"
7627,COMETS,
7628,COMETS,"On the other side,"
7629,COMETS,"Incensed with indignation, Satan stood"
7630,COMETS,"Unterrified, and like a comet burned,"
7631,COMETS,That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge
7632,COMETS,"In the arctic sky, and from his horrid hair"
7633,COMETS,Shakes pestilence and war.--ii. 706-11.
7634,COMETS,
7635,COMETS,This passage is eminently descriptive of the appearance of a great
7636,COMETS,"comet, and the occasion on which it is introduced adds to the intensity"
7637,COMETS,of the lurid imaginings and feelings of terror and dismay with which
7638,COMETS,these objects have always been regarded. The comparison of the enraged
7639,COMETS,Prince of Hell with one of those mysterious and fiery looking visitors
7640,COMETS,"to our skies was a grand conception of the poet's, and one worthy of the"
7641,COMETS,mighty combatant. Ophiuchus (the Serpent-bearer) is a large
7642,COMETS,constellation which occupies a rather barren region of the heavens to
7643,COMETS,"the south of Hercules. It has a length of about forty degrees, and is"
7644,COMETS,represented by the figure of a man bearing a serpent in both hands. It
7645,COMETS,is not easy to imagine why Milton should have assigned the comet to
7646,COMETS,this uninteresting constellation; he may possibly have seen one in this
7647,COMETS,"part of the sky, or his poetical ear may have perceived that the"
7648,COMETS,"expression 'Ophiuchus huge,' which has about it a ponderous rhythm, was"
7649,COMETS,well adapted for the poetic description of a comet.
7650,COMETS,
7651,COMETS,"The only other allusion in the poem to a comet is near its conclusion,"
7652,COMETS,"when the Cherubim descend to take possession of the Garden, prior to the"
7653,COMETS,removal of Adam and Eve--
7654,COMETS,
7655,COMETS,"High in front advanced,"
7656,COMETS,"The brandished sword of God before them blazed,"
7657,COMETS,"Fierce as a comet; which with torrid heat,"
7658,COMETS,And vapour as the Lybian air adust
7659,COMETS,Began to parch that temperate clime.--xii. 632-36.

7662,FALLING STARS,FALLING STARS
7663,FALLING STARS,
7664,FALLING STARS,"On any clear night an observer can, by attentively watching the heavens,"
7665,FALLING STARS,perceive a few of those objects which become visible for a moment as a
7666,FALLING STARS,streak of light and then vanish. They are the result of the combustion
7667,FALLING STARS,"of small meteoric masses having a celestial origin, and travelling with"
7668,FALLING STARS,"cosmical velocity, and which, in their headlong flight, become so heated"
7669,FALLING STARS,by contact with the Earth's atmosphere that they are converted into
7670,FALLING STARS,glowing vapour. This vapour when it cools condenses into fine powder or
7671,FALLING STARS,"dust, and gradually descends upon the Earth's surface, where it can be"
7672,FALLING STARS,detected.
7673,FALLING STARS,
7674,FALLING STARS,Shooting stars become visible at a height varying between twenty and one
7675,FALLING STARS,"hundred and thirty miles, and their average velocity has been estimated"
7676,FALLING STARS,at about thirty miles a second. Though casual falling stars can be seen
7677,FALLING STARS,"at all times in every part of the heavens, yet there are certain periods"
7678,FALLING STARS,"at which they appear in large numbers, and have been observed to radiate"
7679,FALLING STARS,from certain well-defined parts of the sky. When the radiant point is
7680,FALLING STARS,"overhead, the falling stars spread out and resemble a parachute of fire;"
7681,FALLING STARS,"but when it is below the horizon, the stars ascend upwards like rockets"
7682,FALLING STARS,"into the sky. The radiant point is fixed among the stars, so that at the"
7683,FALLING STARS,"commencement of a shower it may be overhead, and before the termination"
7684,FALLING STARS,of the display it may have travelled below the horizon. The radiant is
7685,FALLING STARS,usually named after the constellation in which it is observed.
7686,FALLING STARS,
7687,FALLING STARS,"The November meteors are called Leonids, because they radiate from a"
7688,FALLING STARS,point in the constellation Leo; those in Taurus are called Taurids; in
7689,FALLING STARS,"Perseus, Perseids; in Lyra, Lyraïds; and in Andromeda, Andromedes,"
7690,FALLING STARS,because their radiant points are situated in those constellations.
7691,FALLING STARS,
7692,FALLING STARS,The falling stars that have attracted most attention are those which
7693,FALLING STARS,appear on or about November 13. Every year at this period they can be
7694,FALLING STARS,"seen in greater or less numbers, and on referring to numerous past"
7695,FALLING STARS,records it has been ascertained that a magnificent display of those
7696,FALLING STARS,objects occurs every thirty-three years. The earliest historical
7697,FALLING STARS,"allusion to this meteoric shower is by Theophanes, who wrote that in the"
7698,FALLING STARS,year 472 A.D. the sky at Constantinople appeared to be on fire with
7699,FALLING STARS,falling stars. In the year 902 A.D. another remarkable display took
7700,FALLING STARS,"place, and from that time until 1833 twelve conspicuous displays are"
7701,FALLING STARS,recorded as having occurred at recurring intervals of thirty-three
7702,FALLING STARS,years. The grandest display of this kind that was ever witnessed
7703,FALLING STARS,occurred in 1833. It was visible over nearly the whole of the American
7704,FALLING STARS,"continent, and, having commenced at midnight, lasted for four or five"
7705,FALLING STARS,hours. The falling stars were so numerous that they appeared to rain
7706,FALLING STARS,"upon the Earth, and caused the utmost consternation and terror among"
7707,FALLING STARS,"those who witnessed the phenomenon, many persons having imagined that"
7708,FALLING STARS,the end of the world was at hand. The regular recurrence of these
7709,FALLING STARS,meteoric displays has been satisfactorily explained by the assumption
7710,FALLING STARS,that round the Sun there travels in an elliptical orbit with planetary
7711,FALLING STARS,velocity a vast shoal of meteoric bodies some millions of miles in
7712,FALLING STARS,length and several hundred thousand miles in breadth. The nearest point
7713,FALLING STARS,"of their orbit to the Sun coincides with the Earth's orbit, and the most"
7714,FALLING STARS,distant part extends beyond the orbit of Uranus. These bodies accomplish
7715,FALLING STARS,a circuit of their orbit in 33-1/4 years. The Earth in her annual
7716,FALLING STARS,"revolution intersects the path of the meteors, and when this occurs some"
7717,FALLING STARS,falling stars can always be seen; but when the intersection happens at
7718,FALLING STARS,"the time the shoal is passing, then there results a grand meteoric"
7719,FALLING STARS,display. Numerous other meteoric swarms travel in orbital paths round
7720,FALLING STARS,the Sun.
7721,FALLING STARS,
7722,FALLING STARS,"Milton, in his poem, alludes to falling stars upon two occasions. In"
7723,FALLING STARS,describing the fall of Mulciber from Heaven he says:--
7724,FALLING STARS,
7725,FALLING STARS,from morn
7726,FALLING STARS,"To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve,"
7727,FALLING STARS,A summer's day; and with the setting sun
7728,FALLING STARS,"Dropt from the zenith like a falling star,"
7729,FALLING STARS,On Lemnos the Ægaean isle.--i. 742-46.
7730,FALLING STARS,
7731,FALLING STARS,The rapid flight of the archangel Uriel from the Sun to the Earth is
7732,FALLING STARS,described in the following lines:--
7733,FALLING STARS,
7734,FALLING STARS,"Thither came Uriel, gliding through the even"
7735,FALLING STARS,"On a sunbeam, swift as a shooting star"

7740,FALLING STARS,
7741,FALLING STARS,Milton mentions the season of the year in which those stars are most
7742,FALLING STARS,"frequently seen, and refers to an ancient belief by which they were"
7743,FALLING STARS,regarded as the precursors of stormy weather. A translation from Virgil
7744,FALLING STARS,contains a similar allusion to them--
7745,FALLING STARS,
7746,FALLING STARS,"Oft shalt thou see ere brooding storms arise,"
7747,FALLING STARS,Star after star glide headlong down the skies.
7748,FALLING STARS,
7749,FALLING STARS,The standard borne by the Cherub Azazel is described as having--

7759,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
7760,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
7761,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The theme chosen by Milton for his great epic, viz. the Fall of Man and"
7762,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,his expulsion from Paradise--perhaps the most momentous incident in the
7763,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,history of the human race--was one worthy of the genius of a great poet
7764,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,and in the treatment of which Milton has been sublimely successful. The
7765,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,newly created Earth; the untainted loveliness of the Paradise in which
7766,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,our first parents dwelt during their innocence; their temptation; their
7767,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"fall and removal from the happy garden, furnished a theme which afforded"
7768,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,him an opportunity for the display of his unrivalled poetic genius.
7769,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
7770,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Though the chief interest in the poem is centred in the Garden of Eden
7771,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"and its occupants, yet Milton was enabled, by the comprehensive manner"
7772,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"in which he treated his subject, to introduce into his work a cosmology"
7773,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"which embraced not only the system to which our globe belongs, but the"
7774,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,entire starry heavens by which we are surrounded. But the universality
7775,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,of his genius did not rest here. In the utterance of his sacred song he
7776,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"soared beyond the starry sphere, describing himself as wrapt above the"
7777,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"pole--the starry pole--up to the Empyrean, or Heaven of Heavens, the"
7778,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,ineffable abode of the Deity and the blissful habitation of angelic
7779,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"beings who, in adoration and worship, surround the throne of the Most"
7780,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,High.
7781,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
7782,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Descending to that nether world at the opposite pole of the universe, in"
7783,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"the lowest depth of Chaos, the place prepared by Eternal Justice for the"
7784,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"rebellious, he unfolds to our horror-stricken gaze the terrors of this"
7785,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,infernal region; its fiery deluge of ever-burning sulphur; its 'regions
7786,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,of sorrow;' its 'doleful shades'--the unhappy abode of fallen angels who
7787,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"'in floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,' alternated by exposure"
7788,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"to unendurable cold and icy torment, experience the direful consequences"
7789,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,of their apostacy.
7790,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
7791,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Milton's 'Paradise Lost' may be regarded as the loftiest intellectual
7792,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,effort in the whole range of literature. In it we find all that was
7793,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"known of science, philosophy, and theology. The theme, founded upon a"
7794,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Bible narrative, itself written under divine inspiration, embraces the"
7795,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"entire system of Christian doctrine as revealed in the Scriptures, and"
7796,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,many of the noblest passages in the sacred volume are introduced into
7797,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,the poem expressed in the lofty utterance of flowing and harmonious
7798,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,verse. The choicest classical writings of Greek and Latin authors; the
7799,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,mythological and traditional beliefs of ancient nations; historical
7800,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,incidents of valour and renown and all that was great and good in the
7801,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,annals of mankind were laid under contribution by Milton in the
7802,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,illustration and embellishment of his poem.
7803,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
7804,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,In order to obtain a basis or foundation upon which to construct his
7805,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"great epic, Milton found it necessary to localise the regions of space"
7806,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,in which the principal events mentioned in his poem are described as
7807,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,having occurred. The unfathomable abyss of space may be regarded as an
7808,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"uncircumscribed sphere boundless on all sides round, and so far as we"
7809,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,can comprehend of infinite extent. This sphere Milton divided into two
7810,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"hemispheres--an upper and a lower. The upper was called Heaven, or the"
7811,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Empyrean--a glorified region of boundless dimensions; the lower
7812,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"hemisphere embraced Chaos--a dark, fathomless abyss in which the"
7813,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,elements of matter existed in a state of perpetual tumult and wild
7814,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,uproar. The occurrence of a rebellion in Heaven necessitated a further
7815,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"division of the sphere. The revolt, headed by Lucifer, one of the"
7816,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"highest archangels, afterwards known as Satan, who drew after him a"
7817,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"third of the angelic host, contested the supremacy of Heaven with"
7818,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Michael and the angels which kept their loyalty. After two days'
7819,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,battle--
7820,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
7821,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Him the Almighty Power
7822,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Hurled headlong flaming from the ethereal sky,"
7823,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"With hideous ruin and combustion, down"
7824,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,To bottomless perdition; there to dwell
7825,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,In adamantine chains and penal fire.--i. 44-48.
7826,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
7827,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Having been precipitated over the crystal wall of Heaven into the deep
7828,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"abyss, Milton says:--"
7829,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
7830,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Nine days they fell; confounded Chaos roared,"
7831,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,And felt tenfold confusion in their fall
7832,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Through his wild Anarchy; so huge a rout
7833,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Encumbered him with ruin. Hell at last,"
7834,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Yawning, received them whole, and on them closed.--vi. 871-75."
7835,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
7836,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Hell, Milton locates in the lowest depth of Chaos, a region cut off from"
7837,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"the body of Chaos, through which the expelled angels fell for nine days"
7838,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,before reaching their destined habitation. There are now three divisions
7839,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"of space: HEAVEN, CHAOS, and HELL. But a fourth is required to enable"
7840,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Milton to complete his scheme for the delineation of his poem. The Earth
7841,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"and starry universe were not as yet called into existence, but after the"
7842,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"overthrow of the rebellious angels, God, by circumscribing a portion of"
7843,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Chaos situated immediately underneath the Empyrean, created the Mundane"
7844,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Universe, or the 'Heavens and the Earth.'[15] This new universe He"
7845,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"reclaimed from Chaos, and with the embryo elements of matter--"
7846,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
7847,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,His dark materials to create new worlds.--ii. 916.
7848,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
7849,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"He formed the Earth and all the countless shining orbs visible overhead,"
7850,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"and the myriads more which the telescope reveals, scattered in"
7851,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,apparently endless profusion over the circular immensity of space. It is
7852,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,this new universe--the Earth and Starry Heavens--that claims our chief
7853,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"attention, and in the delineation of Milton's imaginative and"
7854,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,descriptive powers it is to this latest manifestation of Divine wisdom
7855,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,and might that our remarks shall principally apply. After the expulsion
7856,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"of the rebel angels from Heaven, God sent His Son, the Messiah to create"
7857,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,the new universe--a work of omnipotence described by Milton in a manner
7858,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,worthy of so magnificent a display of almighty power--
7859,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
7860,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Meanwhile the Son
7861,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"On his great expedition now appeared,"
7862,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Girt with omnipotence, with radiance crowned"
7863,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Of majesty divine: sapience and love
7864,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Immense; and all his Father in Him shone.
7865,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,About his chariot numberless were poured
7866,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones,"
7867,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"And Virtues, winged Spirits, and chariots winged"
7868,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"From the armoury of God, where stand of old"
7869,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Myriads, between two brazen mountains lodged"
7870,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Against a solemn day, harnessed at hand,"
7871,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Celestial equipage; and now came forth
7872,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Spontaneous, for within them Spirit lived,"
7873,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Attendant on their Lord. Heaven opened wide
7874,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Her ever-during gates, harmonious sound!"
7875,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"On golden hinges moving, to let forth"
7876,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The King of Glory, in his powerful Word"
7877,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"And Spirit, coming to create new worlds."
7878,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"On Heavenly ground they stood, and from the shore"
7879,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,They viewed the vast immeasurable abyss
7880,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Outrageous as a sea, dark, wasteful, wild,"
7881,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Up from the bottom turned by furious winds
7882,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"And surging waves, as mountains to assault"
7883,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Heaven's highth, and with the centre mix the pole."
7884,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"'Silence, ye troubled Waves, and thou Deep, peace!'"
7885,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Said then the omnific Word: 'your discord end!'
7886,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Nor stayed; but on the wings of Cherubim
7887,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Uplifted, in paternal glory rode"
7888,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Far into Chaos, and the World unborn;"
7889,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,For Chaos heard his voice. Him all his train
7890,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Followed in bright procession, to behold"
7891,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Creation, and the wonders of his might."
7892,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Then stayed the fervid wheels, and in his hand"
7893,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"He took the golden compasses, prepared"
7894,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"In God's eternal store, to circumscribe"
7895,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"This Universe, and all created things."
7896,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"One foot he centred, and the other turned"
7897,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Round through the vast profundity obscure;
7898,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"And said, 'Thus far extend, thus far thy bounds;"
7899,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"This be thy just circumference, O World!'"
7900,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Thus God the Heaven created, thus the Earth,"
7901,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Matter unformed and void. Darkness profound
7902,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Covered the abyss; but on the watery calm
7903,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspread,"
7904,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"And vital virtue infused, and vital warmth,"
7905,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Throughout the fluid mass; but downward purged
7906,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The black, tartareous, cold, infernal dregs,"
7907,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Adverse to life; then founded, then conglobed"
7908,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Like things to like; the rest to several place
7909,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Disparted, and between spun out the Air;"
7910,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,And Earth self balanced on her centre hung.--vii. 192-242.
7911,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
7912,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Milton begins his narrative of the Creation by describing the progress
7913,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"of the Deity on His great expedition, accompanied by hosts of angels and"
7914,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,surrounded with all the solemn pomp and splendour of Heaven. The
7915,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"brilliant throng having passed through Heaven's gates, which opened wide"
7916,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"their portals, they beheld in front of them the dark abyss of Chaos--a"
7917,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,tempest-tossed sea of warring elements upturned in wild confusion. At
7918,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"God's instant command silence and peace reigned over the deep, and"
7919,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,tranquil calm succeeded noisy discord. Then on the wings of Cherubim He
7920,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"rode far into Chaos, and with His golden compasses decreed the"
7921,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,dimensions of the universe by circumscribing the vast vacuity of space.
7922,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Into the elements which hasted to their several places, His Spirit"
7923,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,infused vital warmth and caused the formless mass of matter to assume
7924,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"the figure of a sphere, and thus the Earth poised on her axis"
7925,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"unsupported, and in darkness shrouded hung suspended in space. The"
7926,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"placing of the golden compasses in the hands of the Creator, with which"
7927,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"He measured out the heavens, is a noble conception on the part of"
7928,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Milton, and one most appropriate, since the construction of the universe"
7929,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,is based upon the principles of geometrical science.
7930,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
7931,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,'Let there be Light!' said God; and forthwith Light
7932,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure,"
7933,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Sprung from the Deep; and from her native east
7934,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"To journey through the aëry gloom began,"
7935,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Sphered in a radiant cloud; for yet the Sun
7936,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Was not; she in a cloudy tabernacle
7937,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Sojourned the while. God saw the light was good;
7938,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,And light from darkness by the hemisphere
7939,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Divided; light the day, and darkness night"
7940,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,He named. Thus was the first day even and morn:
7941,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Nor passed uncelebrated, nor unsung"
7942,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"By the celestial quires, when orient light"
7943,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Exhaling first from darkness they beheld;
7944,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Birthday of Heaven and Earth; with joy and shout
7945,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The hollow universal orb they filled,"
7946,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"And touched their golden harps, and hymning praised"
7947,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"God and his works: Creator Him they sung,"
7948,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Both when first evening was, and when first morn.--vii. 243-60."
7949,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
7950,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The appearance of Light, which sprung into existence at the fiat of the"
7951,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Creator, was the next great event witnessed by beholding"
7952,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"angels--birthday of Heaven and Earth, first morning and first evening,"
7953,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,which the celestial choirs celebrated with praise and shouts of joy.
7954,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,The creation of the firmament was the great work of the second day.
7955,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
7956,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Again God said, 'Let there be firmament"
7957,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Amid the waters, and let it divide"
7958,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,The waters from the waters!' And God made
7959,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,"
7960,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Transparent, elemental air, diffused"
7961,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,In circuit to the uttermost convex
7962,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Of this great round--partition firm and sure,"
7963,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,The waters underneath from those above
7964,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Dividing; for as the Earth, so He the World"
7965,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Built on circumfluous waters calm, in wide"
7966,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Crystalline ocean, and the loud misrule"
7967,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Of Chaos far removed, lest fierce extremes"
7968,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Contiguous might distemper the whole frame:
7969,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,And Heaven he named the Firmament. So even
7970,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,And morning chorus sung the second day.--vii. 261-275.
7971,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
7972,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,After describing the gathering of the waters off the face of the globe
7973,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"into seas, causing the dry land to appear, which at the word of God"
7974,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"became clothed with vegetation, rendering the Earth a habitable abode,"
7975,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Milton proceeds to describe the creation of the heavenly bodies--
7976,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
7977,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Again the Almighty spake: 'Let there be Lights
7978,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"High in the expanse of Heaven, to divide"
7979,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The day from night; and let them be for signs,"
7980,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"For seasons, and for days, and circling years;"
7981,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"And let them be for lights, as I ordain"
7982,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Their office in the firmament of Heaven,"
7983,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,To give light on the Earth!' and it was so.
7984,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"And God made two great Lights, great for their use"
7985,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"To Man, the greater to have rule by day,"
7986,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The less by night, altern; and made the Stars,"
7987,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,And set them in the firmament of Heaven
7988,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"To illuminate the Earth, and rule the day"
7989,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"In their vicissitude, and rule the night,"
7990,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"And light from darkness to divide. God saw,"
7991,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Surveying his great work, that it was good:"
7992,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"For, of celestial bodies, first, the Sun,"
7993,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"A mighty sphere He framed, unlightsome first,"
7994,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Though of ethereal mould; then formed the Moon
7995,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Globose, and every magnitude of Stars,"
7996,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,And sowed with stars the Heaven thick as a field.
7997,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Of light by far the greater part he took,"
7998,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Transplanted from her cloudy shrine, and placed"

8000,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,And drink the liquid light; firm to retain
8001,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Her gathered beams, great palace now of Light."
8002,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Hither, as to their fountain, other stars"
8003,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Repairing, in their golden urns draw light,"
8004,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,And hence the morning planet gilds her horns;
8005,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,By tincture or reflection they augment
8006,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Their small peculiar, though, from human sight"
8007,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"So far remote, with diminution seen."
8008,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"First in his east the glorious lamp was seen,"
8009,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Regent of day, and all the horizon round"
8010,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Invested with bright rays, jocund to run"
8011,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,His longitude through Heaven's high road; the grey
8012,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Dawn, and the Pleiades before him danced,"
8013,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Shedding sweet influence. Less bright the Moon,"
8014,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,But opposite in levelled west was set
8015,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"His mirror, with full face borrowing her light"
8016,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,From him; for other light she needed none
8017,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"In that aspect, and still that distance keeps"
8018,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Till night; then in the east her turn she shines,"
8019,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Revolved on Heaven's great axle, and her reign"
8020,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"With thousand lesser lights dividual holds,"
8021,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,With thousand thousand stars that then appeared
8022,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Spangling the hemisphere. Then first adorned
8023,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"With their bright luminaries, that set and rose,"
8024,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day.--vii. 339-86.
8025,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8026,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The first creation was Light, and Milton, according to Scriptural"
8027,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"testimony, ascribes its origin to the bidding of the Creator. 'God said,"
8028,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Let there be light; and there was light!' The Sun he describes as a
8029,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"mighty sphere, but at first non-luminous. There was light, but no sun."
8030,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The reason usually given in explanation of this phenomenon is, that the"
8031,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"heavenly bodies were created at the same time as the Earth, but were"
8032,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,rendered invisible by a canopy of vapour and cloud which enveloped the
8033,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"newly-formed globe; and that afterwards, when it dispersed, they"
8034,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"appeared in the firmament, shining in all their pristine splendour."
8035,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Milton does not, however, adhere to this view of things, but says that"
8036,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,light for the first three days sojourned in a cloudy shrine or
8037,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"tabernacle, and was afterwards transplanted in the Sun, which became a"
8038,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,great palace of light.
8039,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8040,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"He expresses himself in a somewhat similar manner in Book III., which"
8041,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,opens with an address to Light--one of the most beautiful passages in
8042,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"the poem, in which he alludes to his blindness when expressing his"
8043,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"thoughts and sentiments with regard to this ethereal medium, which"
8044,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,conveys to us the pleasurable sensation of vision--
8045,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8046,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Hail, holy Light! offspring of Heaven first-born!"
8047,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Or of the Eternal co-eternal beam,"
8048,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"May I express thee unblamed? since God is light,"
8049,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,And never but in unapproached light
8050,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Dwelt from eternity--dwelt then in thee,"
8051,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Bright effluence of bright essence increate!
8052,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Or hear'st thou rather, pure Ethereal stream,"
8053,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Whose fountain who shall tell? Before the Sun,"
8054,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice"
8055,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Of God, as with a mantle, didst invest"
8056,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The rising world of waters dark and deep,"
8057,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Won from the void and formless Infinite.--iii. 1-12.
8058,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8059,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The Sun having become a lucent orb, Milton poetically describes how the"
8060,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"planets repair to him as to a fountain, and in their golden urns draw"
8061,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,light; and how the morning planet Venus gilds her horns illumined by his
8062,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,rays. The poet associates joyous ideas with the new-born universe. The
8063,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Sun, now the glorious regent of day, begins his journey in the east,"
8064,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,lighting up the horizon with his beams; whilst before him danced the
8065,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"grey dawn, and the Pleiades shedding sweet influences. There existed an"
8066,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"ancient belief that the Earth was created in the spring, and in April"
8067,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"the Sun is in the zodiacal constellation Taurus, in which are also"
8068,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"situated the Pleiades; they rise a little before the orb, and precede"
8069,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,him in his path through the heavens. The stars of this group have always
8070,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"been regarded with a peculiar sacredness, and their rays, mingling with"
8071,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"those of the Sun, were believed to shed sweet influences upon the Earth."
8072,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The Moon, less bright, with borrowed light, in her turn shines in the"
8073,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"east, and, with the thousand thousand luminaries that spangle the"
8074,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"firmament, reigns over the night."
8075,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8076,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"We learn in Book III. that the archangel Uriel, who was beguiled by"
8077,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Satan, witnessed the Creation, and described how the heavenly bodies"
8078,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"were brought into existence, he having perceived what we should call the"
8079,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,gaseous elements of matter rolled into whorls and vortices which became
8080,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,condensed into suns and systems of worlds. This mighty angel says:--
8081,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8082,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"I saw when, at his word the formless mass,"
8083,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"This World's material mould, came to a heap:"
8084,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Confusion heard his voice, and wild Uproar"
8085,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Stood ruled, stood vast Infinitude confined;"
8086,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Till at his second bidding darkness fled,"
8087,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Light shone, and order from disorder sprung."
8088,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Swift to their several quarters hasted then
8089,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The cumbrous elements, Earth, Flood, Air, Fire;"
8090,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,And this ethereal quintessence of Heaven
8091,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Flew upward, spirited with various forms,"
8092,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"That rolled orbicular, and turned to stars"
8093,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move;"
8094,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Each had his place appointed, each his course;"
8095,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,The rest in circuit walls this Universe.--iii. 708-21.
8096,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8097,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,In his sublime description of the Creation Milton has adhered with
8098,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"marked fidelity to the Mosaic version, as narrated in the first two"
8099,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"chapters of Genesis, when God, by specific acts in certain stated"
8100,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"periods of time, created the visible universe and all that it contains."
8101,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8102,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,The successive acts of creation are described in words almost identical
8103,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"with those of Scripture, embellished and adorned with all the wealth of"
8104,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,expression which our language is capable of affording. The several
8105,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"scenes presented to the imagination, and witnessed by hosts of admiring"
8106,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"angels as each portion of the magnificent work was accomplished, are"
8107,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,full of a grandeur and majesty worthy of the loftiest conceivable effort
8108,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,of Divine power and might.
8109,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8110,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,The return of the Creator after the completion of His great work is
8111,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,described by Milton in a manner worthy of the progress of Deity through
8112,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"the celestial regions. The whole creation rang with jubilant delight,"
8113,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,and the bright throng which witnessed the wonders of His might followed
8114,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Him with acclamation, ascending by the glorified path of the Milky Way"
8115,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,up to His high abode--the Heaven of Heavens--
8116,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8117,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Here finished He, and all that He had made"
8118,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Viewed, and behold! all was entirely good."
8119,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,So even and morn accomplished the sixth day:
8120,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Yet not till the Creator from his work
8121,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Desisting, though unwearied, up returned,"
8122,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Up to the Heaven of Heavens, His high abode,"
8123,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Thence to behold this new created World,"
8124,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The addition of his empire, how it showed"
8125,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"In prospect from His throne, how good, how fair,"
8126,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Answering his great idea. Up He rode,"
8127,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Followed with acclamation, and the sound"
8128,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Symphonious of ten thousand harps, that tuned"
8129,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Angelic harmonies: The Earth, the Air"
8130,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Resounded (thou remember'st, for thou heard'st)"
8131,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The Heavens and all the constellations rung,"
8132,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The planets in their stations listening stood,"
8133,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,While the bright pomp ascended jubilant.
8134,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,'Open ye everlasting gates!' they sung;
8135,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,'Open ye Heavens! your living doors; let in
8136,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The great Creator, from his work returned"
8137,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Magnificent, his six days' work, a World;"
8138,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deign"
8139,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"To visit oft the dwellings of just men,"
8140,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Delighted; and with frequent intercourse
8141,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Thither will send his winged messengers
8142,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,On errands of supernal grace.' So sung
8143,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The glorious train ascending: He through Heaven,"
8144,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"That opened wide her blazing portals, led"
8145,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,To God's eternal house direct the way--
8146,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"A broad and ample road, whose dust is gold,"
8147,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"And pavement stars, as stars to thee appear"
8148,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Seen in the Galaxy, that Milky Way"
8149,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Which nightly as a circling zone thou seest
8150,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Powdered with stars.--vii. 548-81.
8151,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8152,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Milton, throughout his description of the Creation, sustains with lofty"
8153,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,eloquence his sublime conception of this latest display of almighty
8154,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"power; and invests with becoming majesty all the acts of the Creator,"
8155,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"who, when He finished His great work, saw that all was entirely good."
8156,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8157,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Shortly after the creation of the new universe, Satan, having escaped"
8158,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"from Hell, plunged into the abyss of Chaos, and, after a long and"
8159,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"arduous journey upwards, in which he had to fight his way through the"
8160,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"surging elements that raged around him like a tempestuous sea, he"
8161,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,reached the upper confines of this region where less confusion
8162,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"prevailed, and where a glimmering dawn of light penetrated its darkness"
8163,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"and gloom, indicating that the limit of the empire of Chaos and ancient"
8164,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Night had been reached by the adventurous fiend. Pursuing his way with
8165,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"greater ease, he leisurely beholds the sight which is opening to his"
8166,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,eyes--a sight rendered more glorious by his long sojourn in darkness. He
8167,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,sees:--
8168,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8169,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Far off the empyreal Heaven, extended wide"
8170,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"In circuit, undetermined square or round,"
8171,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,With opal towers and battlements adorned
8172,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Of living sapphire, once his native seat,"
8173,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"And, fast by, hanging in a golden chain,"
8174,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"This pendent World, in bigness as a star"
8175,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Of smallest magnitude close by the Moon.--ii. 1047-53.
8176,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8177,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"He gazes upon his native Heaven where once he dwelt, and observes the"
8178,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,pendent world in quest of which he journeyed hither--hung by a golden
8179,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,chain from the Empyrean and no larger than a star of the smallest
8180,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,magnitude when close by the Moon. In this passage Milton does not allude
8181,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"to the Earth, which was invisible, but to the entire starry heavens--the"
8182,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"newly created universe reclaimed from Chaos, which, when contrasted with"
8183,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"the Empyrean, appeared in size no larger than the minutest star when"
8184,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"compared with the full moon. Pursuing his journey, the new universe as"
8185,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,it is approached expands into a globe of vast dimensions; its convex
8186,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,surface--round which the chaotic elements in stormy aspect
8187,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"lowered--seemed a boundless continent, dark, desolate, and starless,"
8188,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"except on the side next to the wall of Heaven, which though far-distant"
8189,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"afforded it some illumination by its reflected light. Satan, having"
8190,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"alighted on this convex shell which enclosed the universe, wandered long"
8191,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"over its bleak and dismal surface, until his attention was attracted by"
8192,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,a gleam of light which appeared through an opening at its zenith right
8193,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"underneath the Empyrean. Thither he directed his steps, and perceived a"
8194,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"structure resembling a staircase, or ladder, which formed the only means"
8195,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"of communication between Heaven and the new creation, and upon which"
8196,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,angels descended and ascended--
8197,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8198,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Far distant he descries,"
8199,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Ascending by degrees magnificent
8200,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Up to the wall of Heaven, a structure high;"
8201,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"At top whereof, but far more rich, appeared"
8202,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The work as of a kingly palace gate,"
8203,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,With frontispiece of diamond and gold
8204,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Embellished; thick with sparkling orient gems
8205,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The portal shone, inimitable on Earth"
8206,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"By model, or by shading pencil drawn."
8207,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,The stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw
8208,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Angels ascending and descending, bands"
8209,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Of Guardians bright, when he from Esau fled"
8210,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"To Padan Aram, in the field of Luz"
8211,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Dreaming by night under the open sky,"
8212,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"And waking cried, '_This is the gate of Heaven._'--iii. 501-15."
8213,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8214,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Sometimes this mysterious structure was drawn up to Heaven and
8215,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"invisible. At the time that Satan reached the opening, the stairs were"
8216,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"lowered, and standing at their base he looked down with wonder upon the"
8217,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,entire starry universe--
8218,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8219,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Such wonder seized, though after Heaven seen,"
8220,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The Spirit malign, but much more envy seized,"
8221,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"At sight of all this World beheld so fair,"
8222,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Round he surveys (and well might, where he stood"
8223,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,So high above the circling canopy
8224,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Of night's extended shade) from eastern point
8225,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Of Libra to the fleecy star that bears
8226,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Andromeda far off Atlantic seas
8227,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Beyond the horizon; then from pole to pole
8228,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"He views in breadth, and without longer pause,"
8229,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Down right into the World's first region throws
8230,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"His flight precipitant, and winds with ease"
8231,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Through the pure marble air his oblique way
8232,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Amongst innumerable stars, that shone"
8233,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Stars distant, but nigh hand seemed other worlds,"
8234,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Or other worlds they seemed, or happy isles,"
8235,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Like those Hesperian Gardens famed of old,"
8236,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Fortunate fields, and groves, and flowery vales;"
8237,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Thrice happy isles! But who dwelt happy there
8238,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,He staid not to inquire: above them all
8239,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The golden Sun, in splendour likest Heaven"
8240,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Allured his eye: thither his course he bends
8241,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Through the calm firmament, (but up or down"
8242,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,By centre or eccentric hard to tell
8243,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Or longitude) where the great luminary,"
8244,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Aloof the vulgar constellations thick,"
8245,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"That from his lordly eye keep distance due,"
8246,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Dispenses light from far. They, as they move"
8247,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Their starry dance in numbers that compute
8248,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Days, months, and years, towards his all-cheering lamp"
8249,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Turn swift their various motions, or are turned"
8250,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"By his magnetic beam, that gently warms"
8251,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The Universe, and to each inward part"
8252,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"With gentle penetration, though unseen,"
8253,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Shoots invisible virtue even to the Deep;
8254,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,So wondrously was set his station bright.--iii. 552-87.
8255,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8256,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,The Ptolemaic cosmology having been adopted by Milton in the elaboration
8257,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"of his poem, he describes the universe in conformity with the doctrines"
8258,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,associated with this form of astronomical belief. To each of the first
8259,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,seven spheres which revolved round the steadfast Earth there was
8260,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,attached a heavenly body; the eighth sphere embraced all the fixed
8261,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"stars, a countless multitude; the ninth the crystalline; and enclosing"
8262,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"all the other spheres as if in a shell was the tenth sphere, or Primum"
8263,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Mobile, which in its diurnal revolution carried round with it all the"
8264,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"other spheres. The nine inner spheres were transparent, but the tenth"
8265,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"was an opaque solid shell-like structure, which enclosed the new"
8266,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,universe and constituted the boundary between it and Chaos underneath
8267,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,and the Empyrean above. It was on the surface of this sphere that Satan
8268,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"wandered until he discovered the opening at its zenith, where, by means"
8269,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"of a staircase or ladder, communication was maintained with the"
8270,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Empyrean. Standing on the lower steps of this structure he paused for a
8271,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,moment to look down into the glorious universe which lay beneath him--
8272,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8273,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,another Heaven
8274,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"From Heaven-gate not far, founded in view"
8275,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,On the clear hyaline the glassy sea.--vii. 617-19.
8276,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8277,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"He beholds it in all its dimensions, from pole to pole, and"
8278,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"longitudinally from Libra to Aries, then without hesitation precipitates"
8279,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"himself down into the world's first region, and winds his way with ease"
8280,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"among the fixed stars. Around him he sees innumerable shining worlds,"
8281,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,sparkling and glittering in endless profusion over the circumscribed
8282,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,immensity of space--mighty constellations that shone from afar;
8283,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,clustering aggregations of stars; floating islands of light; twinkling
8284,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"systems rising out of depths still more profound, and a zone luminous"
8285,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,with the light of myriads of lucid orbs verging on the confines of the
8286,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"universe. All these worlds the fiend passed unheeded, nor stayed he to"
8287,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,inquire who dwelt happy there. In splendour above them all the Sun
8288,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"attracted his attention and, directing his course towards the great"
8289,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"luminary of our system, he alights on the surface of the orb."
8290,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8291,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Milton now makes a digression in order to describe what Satan observed
8292,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,in the Sun after having landed there. The poet embraces an opportunity
8293,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,for exercising his imaginative and descriptive powers by giving an ideal
8294,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"description of what, judging from the appearance of the orb, might be"
8295,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,the natural condition of things existing on his surface--
8296,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8297,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps"
8298,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Astronomer in the Sun's lucent orb
8299,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Through his glazed optic tube, yet never saw."
8300,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The place he found beyond expression bright,"
8301,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Compared with aught on Earth, metal or stone;"
8302,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Not all parts like, but all alike informed"
8303,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"With radiant light, as glowing iron with fire;"
8304,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"If metal, part seemed gold, part silver clear;"
8305,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"If stone, carbuncle most or chrysolite,"
8306,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Ruby or topaz, to the twelve that shone"
8307,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"In Aaron's breastplate, and a stone besides,"
8308,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen;
8309,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"That stone, or like to that, which here below"
8310,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Philosophers in vain so long have sought,"
8311,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"In vain, though by their powerful art they bind"
8312,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Volatile Hermes, and call up unbound"
8313,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"In various shapes old Proteus from the sea,"
8314,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Drained through a limbec to his native form.
8315,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,What wonder then if fields and regions here
8316,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Breathe forth elixir pure, and rivers run"
8317,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Potable gold, when, with one virtuous touch,"
8318,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The arch-chemic Sun, so far from us remote,"
8319,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Produces, with terrestrial humour mixed,"
8320,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Here in the dark so many precious things
8321,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Of colour glorious, and effect so rare?"
8322,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Here matter new to gaze the Devil met
8323,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Undazzled; far and wide his eye commands;
8324,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade,"
8325,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"But all sunshine, as when his beams at noon"
8326,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Culminate from the equator, as they now"
8327,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Shot upward still direct, whence no way round"
8328,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Shadow from body opaque can fall; and the air,"
8329,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Nowhere so clear sharpened his visual ray
8330,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"To objects distant far, whereby he soon"
8331,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Saw within here a glorious Angel stand.--iii. 588-622.
8332,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8333,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,The physical structure of the interior of the Sun is unknown; all that
8334,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,we see of the orb is the photosphere--the dazzling luminous envelope
8335,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"which indicates to the eye the boundary of the solar disc, and which is"
8336,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"the source of light and heat. Milton, in his imaginative and beautifully"
8337,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"poetical description of the Sun, is not more fanciful in his conception"
8338,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,of the nature of the refulgent orb than a renowned astronomer (Sir
8339,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"William Herschel) who writes in the following strain: 'A cool, dark,"
8340,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"solid globe, its surface diversified with mountains and valleys, clothed"
8341,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"in luxuriant vegetation and richly stored with inhabitants, protected by"
8342,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,a heavy cloud-canopy from the intolerable glare of the upper luminous
8343,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"region, where the dazzling coruscations of a solar aurora some thousands"
8344,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,of miles in depth evolved the stores of light and heat which vivify our
8345,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"world.' Satan, disguised as a cherub, makes himself known to Uriel,"
8346,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Regent of the Sun. The upright Seraph in response to his request directs
8347,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"him to the Earth, the abode of Man--"
8348,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8349,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Look downward on that Globe, whose hither side"
8350,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"With light from hence, though but reflected, shines,"
8351,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"That place is Earth, the seat of Man; that light"
8352,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"His day, which else, as the other hemisphere,"
8353,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Night would invade; but there neighbouring Moon
8354,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,(So call that opposite fair star) her aid
8355,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Timely interposes, and her monthly round"
8356,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Still ending, still renewing, through mid-Heaven,"
8357,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,With borrowed light her countenance triform
8358,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Hence fills and empties, to enlighten the Earth,"
8359,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,And in her pale dominion checks the night.--iii. 722-32.
8360,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8361,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,It would be impossible not to feel impressed with the accuracy and
8362,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,comprehensiveness of Milton's astronomical knowledge; and how he has
8363,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,united in charming poetic expression the dry details of science with the
8364,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,divine inspiration of the heavenly muse. The distinctive appearances of
8365,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars; their functional importance as"
8366,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,regards this terrestrial sphere; the splendour and lustre peculiar to
8367,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"each; and the glory displayed in the entire created heavens, are"
8368,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,portrayed with a skill indicative of a masterly knowledge of the science
8369,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,of astronomy.
8370,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8371,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Descend from Heaven, Urania, by that name"
8372,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"If rightly thou art called, whose voice divine"
8373,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Following, above the Olympian hill I soar,"
8374,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Above the flight of Pegasean wing!
8375,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The meaning, not the name, I call; for thou"
8376,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top"
8377,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Of old Olympus dwell'st; but heavenly-born,"
8378,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Before the hills appeared or fountain flowed,"
8379,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Thou with Eternal Wisdom didst converse,"
8380,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Wisdom thy sister, and with her didst play"
8381,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"In presence of the Almighty Father, pleased"
8382,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"With thy celestial song. Up led by thee,"
8383,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Into the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed,"
8384,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"An earthly guest, and drawn empyreal air,"
8385,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Thy tempering. With like safety guided down,"
8386,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Return me to my native element;
8387,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Lest, from this flying steed unreined, (as once"
8388,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Belerophon, though from a lower clime)"
8389,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Dismounted, on the Aleian field I fall,"
8390,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Erroneous there to wander, and forlorn."
8391,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Half yet remains unsung, but narrower bound"
8392,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Within the visible diurnal sphere.
8393,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Standing on Earth, not rapt above the pole,"
8394,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"More safe I sing with mortal voice, unchanged"
8395,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"To hoarse or mute, though fallen on evil days,"
8396,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"On evil days though fallen, and evil tongues,"
8397,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"In darkness, and with dangers compassed round,"
8398,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"And solitude; yet not alone, while thou"
8399,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Visit'st my slumbers nightly, or when morn"
8400,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Purples the east. Still govern thou my song,"
8401,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Urania, and fit audience find though few.--vii. 1-32."
8402,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8403,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,The Muses were Greek mythological divinities who possessed the power of
8404,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"inspiring song, and were the patrons of poets and musicians. According"
8405,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,to Hesiod they were nine in number and presided over the arts. Urania
8406,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"was the Goddess of Astronomy, and Calliope the Goddess of Epic Poetry."
8407,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"They are described as the daughters of Zeus, and Homer alludes to them"
8408,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,as the goddesses of song who dwelt on the summit of Mount Olympus. They
8409,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"were the companions of Apollo, and accompanied with song his playing on"
8410,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,the lyre at the banquets of the Immortals. Milton does not invoke the
8411,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"mythological goddess, but Urania the Heavenly Muse, whose aid he also"
8412,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,implores at the commencement of his poem prior to his flight above the
8413,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Aonian Mount. Under her divine guidance he ascended to the Heaven of
8414,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Heavens and breathed empyreal air, her tempering; in like manner he"
8415,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,requests her to lead him down to his native element lest he should meet
8416,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,with a fate similar to what befell Bellerophon. Half his task he has
8417,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"completed, the other half, confined to narrower bounds within the"
8418,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"visible diurnal sphere, remains unsung, and in its fulfilment he still"
8419,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,implores his celestial patroness to govern his song.
8420,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8421,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,The natural phenomena which occur as a consequence of the motions of the
8422,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"heavenly bodies and the diurnal rotation of the Earth on her axis, are"
8423,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,accompanied by agreeable alternations in the aspect of nature with which
8424,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,every one is familiar. The rosy footsteps of morn; the solar splendour
8425,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,of noonday; the fading hues of even; and night with her jewelled courts
8426,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"and streams of molten stars, have been sung with rapturous admiration by"
8427,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"poets of every nation and in every age. They, as ardent lovers of"
8428,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"nature, have described in choicest language the pleasing vicissitudes"
8429,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,brought about by the real and apparent motions of the celestial orbs.
8430,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8431,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,In this respect Milton is unsurpassed by any poet in ancient or in
8432,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"modern times. The occasions on which he describes the heavenly bodies,"
8433,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"or alludes to them in association with other phenomena, testify to the"
8434,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,felicity of his thoughts and to the greatness of his poetic genius.
8435,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Surely no poet has ever given us a lovelier description of evening, or"
8436,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,has added more to its exquisite beauty by his allusion to the celestial
8437,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"orbs, than Milton when he describes the first evening in Paradise--"
8438,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8439,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Now came still Evening on, and Twilight gray"
8440,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Had in her sober livery all things clad;
8441,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Silence accompanied; for beast and bird,"
8442,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"They to their grassy couch, these to their nests"
8443,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale."
8444,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,She all night long her amorous descant sung;
8445,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Silence was pleased. Now glowed the firmament
8446,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,With living sapphires: Hesperus that led
8447,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The starry host, rode brightest, till the Moon,"
8448,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Rising in clouded majesty, at length"
8449,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Apparent queen, unveiled her peerless light,"
8450,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw.--iv. 598-609.
8451,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8452,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"In the avowal of her conjugal love, Eve, with charming expression,"
8453,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,associates the orbs of the firmament with the delightful appearances of
8454,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,nature which presented themselves to her observation after she awoke to
8455,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,the consciousness of intelligent existence.
8456,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8457,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Sweet is the breath of Morn, her rising sweet,"
8458,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"With charm of earliest birds: pleasant the Sun,"
8459,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,When first on this delightful land he spreads
8460,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"His orient beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flower,"
8461,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Glistering with dew; fragrant the fertile Earth
8462,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,After soft showers; and sweet the coming on
8463,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Of grateful Evening mild; then silent Night,"
8464,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"With this her solemn bird, and this fair Moon,"
8465,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"And these the gems of Heaven, her starry train:"
8466,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"But neither breath of Morn, when she ascends"
8467,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,With charm of earliest birds; nor rising Sun
8468,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"On this delightful land; nor herb, fruit, flower,"
8469,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Glistering with dew; nor fragrance after showers;
8470,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Nor grateful Evening mild; nor silent Night,"
8471,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"With this her solemn bird; nor walk by Moon,"
8472,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Or glittering star-light, without thee is sweet."
8473,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,But wherefore all night long shine these? for whom
8474,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes?--iv. 641-58."
8475,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8476,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,One of the charms of Milton's verse is the devoutly poetical sentiment
8477,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"which pervades it. His thoughts, though serious, are not austere or"
8478,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"gloomy, and it is in his loftiest musings that his reverence becomes"
8479,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,most apparent. This feeling is conspicuous in Adam's reply to the
8480,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,inquiry addressed to him by Eve--
8481,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8482,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Daughter of God and Man, accomplished Eve,"
8483,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,These have their course to finish round the Earth
8484,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"By morrow evening, and from land to land"
8485,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"In order, though to nations yet unborn,"
8486,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Ministering light prepared, they set and rise;"
8487,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Lest total Darkness should by night regain
8488,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Her old possession, and extinguish life"
8489,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,In Nature and all things; which these soft fires
8490,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Not only enlighten, but with kindly heat"
8491,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Of various influence foment and warm,"
8492,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Temper or nourish, or in part shed down"
8493,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Their stellar virtue on all kinds that grow
8494,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"On Earth, made hereby apter to receive"
8495,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Perfection from the Sun's more potent ray.
8496,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"These, then, though unbeheld in deep of night,"
8497,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Shine not in vain; nor think, though men were none,"
8498,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"That Heaven would want spectators, God want praise:"
8499,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Millions of spiritual creatures walk the Earth
8500,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep:"
8501,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,All these with ceaseless praise his works behold
8502,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Both day and night. How often from the steep
8503,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Of echoing hill or thicket, have we heard"
8504,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Celestial voices to the midnight air,"
8505,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Sole, or responsive each to other's note"
8506,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Singing their Great Creator! Oft in bands

8539,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Milton's conception of celestial distances, and of the vast regions of"
8540,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"interstellar space, is finely described in the following lines:--"
8541,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,

8543,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"He speeds, and through the vast ethereal sky"

8549,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"As in their morning, so in their evening devotions, our first parents"
8550,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,never fail to introduce a reference to the celestial orbs as indicating
8551,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"the power and goodness of the Creator, made manifest in the beauty and"
8552,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,greatness of His works--
8553,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8554,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Thus, at their shady lodge arrived, both stood,"
8555,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Both turned, and under open sky adored"
8556,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"The God that made both Sky, Air, Earth and Heaven"
8557,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Which they beheld; the Moon's resplendent globe,"
8558,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,And starry pole.--iv. 720-24.
8559,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8560,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,The numerous extracts contained in this volume impress upon one's mind
8561,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"how largely astronomy enters into the composition of 'Paradise Lost,'"
8562,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,and of how much assistance the knowledge of this science was to Milton
8563,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"in the elaboration of his poem. Indeed, it would be hard to imagine how"
8564,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,such a work could have been written except by a poet who possessed a
8565,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,proficient and comprehensive knowledge of astronomy. The chief
8566,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"characteristic of Milton's poetry is its sublimity, which is the natural"
8567,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,outcome of the magnificence of his conceptions and of his own pure
8568,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"imaginative genius. Among all the fields of literature, science, and"
8569,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"philosophy explored by him, he found none more congenial to his tastes,"
8570,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"or that afforded his imagination more freedom for its loftiest flights,"
8571,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,than the sublimest of sciences--astronomy. Whether we admire most the
8572,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"accuracy of his astronomical knowledge, or the wonderful creations of"
8573,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"his poetic fancy, or his beautiful descriptions of the celestial orbs,"
8574,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"it is apparent that in this domain of science, as a poet, he stands"
8575,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,alone and without a rival. In his choice of the Ptolemaic cosmology
8576,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Milton adopted a system with which he had been familiar from his
8577,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"youth--the same which his favourite poet Dante introduced into his poem,"
8578,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"'The Divina Commedia,' and which was well adapted for poetic"
8579,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"description. The picturesque conception of ten revolving spheres,"
8580,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"carrying along with them the orbs assigned to each, which, by their"
8581,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"revolution round the steadfast Earth, brought about with unfailing"
8582,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"regularity the successive alternation of day and night, and in every"
8583,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"twenty-four hours exhibited the pleasing vicissitudes of dawn, of"
8584,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"sunshine, of twilight, and of darkness, relieved by the soft effulgence"
8585,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"of the nocturnal sky, afforded Milton a favourable basis upon which to"
8586,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,construct a cosmical epic. The Copernican theory--with which he was
8587,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"equally conversant, and in the accuracy and truthfulness of which he"
8588,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"believed--though less complicated than the Ptolemaic in its details, did"
8589,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,not possess the same attractiveness for poetic description that belonged
8590,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"to the older system. According to this theory there is, surrounding us"
8591,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"on all sides, a boundless uncircumscribed ocean of space, to which it is"
8592,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,impossible to assign any conceivable limit; in every effort to
8593,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"comprehend its dimensions or fathom its depths, the mind recoils upon"
8594,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"itself, baffled and discomfited, with a conscious feeling that there can"
8595,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,be no nearer approach to the end when end there is none that can be
8596,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,conceived of. Interspersed throughout the regions of this azure vast of
8597,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"space is the stellar universe, which to our comprehension is as infinite"
8598,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"as the abyss in which it exists. The solar system, though of magnificent"
8599,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"dimensions, is but a unit in the astronomical whole, in which are"
8600,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"embraced millions of other similar units--other solar systems, perhaps"
8601,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"differing in construction from that of ours, with billions of miles of"
8602,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,interstellar space intervening between each; yet so vast are the
8603,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,dimensions of the celestial sphere that those distances when measured
8604,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,upon it sink into utter insignificance. As the receding depths of space
8605,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"are penetrated by powerful telescopes, they are found to be pervaded"
8606,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"with stars and starry archipelagoes, distributed in profusion over the"
8607,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"circular immensity and extending away into abysmal depths, beyond the"
8608,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,reach of visibility by any optical means which we possess. To the
8609,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,universe there is no known end--nowhere in imagination can its boundary
8610,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,be reached! This bewildering conception of the cosmos did not trouble
8611,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,the minds of pre-Copernican thinkers. They regarded the steadfast Earth
8612,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,as the most important body in the universe; nor were the celestial orbs
8613,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,which circled round it believed to be very far distant. Tycho Brahé
8614,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,imagined that the stars were not much more remote than the planets.
8615,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Epicurus thought the stars were small crystal mirrors in the sky which
8616,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"reflected the solar rays, and the Venerable Bede remarked that they"
8617,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,needed assistance from the Sun's light in order to render them more
8618,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,luminous.
8619,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8620,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,The adoption of the Ptolemaic system by Milton afforded greater scope
8621,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"for the exercise of his imaginative powers, and enabled him to bring"
8622,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,within the mental grasp of his readers a conception of the universe
8623,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,which was not lost in the immensity associated with the Copernican view
8624,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"of things. Besides, it also furnished him with a distinctly defined"
8625,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,basis upon which to erect the superstructure of his poem. Above the
8626,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,circumscribed universe was Heaven or the Empyrean; underneath it was
8627,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Chaos, from which it had been reclaimed, and in the lowest depth of"
8628,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,which Milton located the infernal world called Hell. These four regions
8629,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,embraced universal space; and in the elaboration of his great epic
8630,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Milton relied upon his imaginative genius, his brilliant scholarship,"
8631,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"his vast erudition, and the divine inspiration of the heavenly muse."
8632,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"With these, aided by the power and vigour of his intellect, he was"
8633,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,enabled to produce a cosmical epic that surpassed all previous efforts
8634,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"of a similar kind, and which still remains without a parallel."
8635,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8636,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,One of the distinguishing features of Milton's mind was his wonderful
8637,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"imagination, and in its exercise he beheld those sublime celestial and"
8638,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"terrestrial visions on which he reared fabrics of splendour and beauty,"
8639,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,described in harmonious numbers with the fervid eloquence and charm of a
8640,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,true poet. An example of the loftiness and originality of his
8641,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"imagination is afforded us in his description of the Creation, the main"
8642,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"facts of which he derived from the first two chapters of Genesis, and"
8643,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,upon these he elaborated in full and striking detail his magnificent
8644,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"conception of the efforts of Divine Might, which in six successive"
8645,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,creative acts called into existence the universe and all that it
8646,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,contains. The rising of the Earth out of Chaos; the creation of light
8647,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,and of the orbs of the firmament; the joyfulness associated with the
8648,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,onward career of the new-born Sun; the subdued illumination of the
8649,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"full-orbed Moon, and the thousand thousand stars that spangle the"
8650,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,nocturnal sky--all these afforded Milton a rich field in which his
8651,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"imagination luxuriated, and in the description of which he found"
8652,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,subject-matter worthy of his gifted intellect.
8653,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8654,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Milton gives an ampler and more detailed description of the new universe
8655,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,in his narration of Satan's journey through space in search of this
8656,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"world, and brings more vividly before the imagination of his readers the"
8657,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"glories of the celestial regions. The fiend, having emerged from the"
8658,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"dark abyss of Chaos into a region of light, first beheld the new"
8659,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,creation from such a distance that to his view it appeared as a star
8660,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,suspended by a golden chain from the Empyrean. This stellar conception
8661,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"of the poet's harmonised with the views of the Ptolemaists, who believed"
8662,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"that the universe was of limited extent, and though its dimensions were"
8663,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"vast beyond comprehension, it was, nevertheless, enclosed by the tenth"
8664,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,sphere or Primum Mobile. It was on the surface of this sphere that Satan
8665,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"alighted, and over which he wandered, until attracted by a beam of light"
8666,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"that appeared through an opening at its zenith, where, by means of a"
8667,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"stair or ladder, communication was maintained between the new universe"
8668,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"and Heaven above. Hither the undaunted fiend hied, and, standing on the"
8669,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"lower steps of this structure, momentarily paused to gaze upon the"
8670,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,glorious sight which burst upon his view before directing his flight
8671,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,down into the newly created universe. Milton then describes his progress
8672,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"through the stellar regions, his landing in the Sun and what he saw"
8673,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"there, and the termination of his journey when he descends from the"
8674,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,ecliptic down to the Earth. In doing so the poet gives a wonderfully
8675,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"beautiful description of the starry universe, of the Sun, Moon, and"
8676,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Earth (Book III. 540-742), enhanced and adorned with his own poetic"
8677,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"imaginings derived from fable, philosophy, and science."
8678,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8679,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Milton makes more frequent allusion to the Sun than to any of the other
8680,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,orbs of the firmament. This we should expect: the poet always gives the
8681,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"orb the precedence which is his due, and never fails, when the occasion"
8682,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"requires it, to surround him with the 'surpassing glory' which marks his"
8683,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"pre-eminence above all other occupants of the sky. The Moon, his"
8684,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,consort--peerless in the subdued effulgence of her borrowed light; the
8685,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"beautiful star of evening, Hesperus; the sidereal heavens with their"
8686,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"untold glories; the Galaxy, overpowering in the magnificence of its"
8687,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,clouds and streams of stars--all these have their beauties and charms
8688,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,mirrored in the pages of this remarkable poem.
8689,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8690,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"That the observation of the celestial orbs, their phases, and the varied"
8691,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"phenomena which occur as a consequence of their motions, were to Milton"
8692,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"an unfailing source of enjoyment and of meditative delight, is evident"
8693,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,from the frequency with which he alludes to them. The following lines
8694,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,also testify to this:--
8695,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8696,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"For wonderful indeed are all his works,"
8697,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all"
8698,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Had in remembrance always with delight!
8699,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,But what created mind can comprehend
8700,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"Their number, or the wisdom infinite"
8701,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"That brought them forth, but hid their causes deep?--iii. 703-708."
8702,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8703,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"It is very pleasant, as Milton says, to"
8704,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8705,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,sit and rightly spell
8706,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,Of every star that heaven doth show.
8707,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,
8708,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"It is also pleasant to know the astronomy of his 'Paradise Lost,' and to"
8709,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,linger over the delightful and harmonious utterances associated with the
8710,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,"sublimest of sciences, expressed in the melodious language of England's"
8711,MILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY,greatest epic poet.
