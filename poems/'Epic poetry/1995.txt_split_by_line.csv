17,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.,It is a happiness for me to connect this volume with the memory of my
18,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.,friend and master from youth. I was but a beginner in the study of the
19,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.,Divine Comedy when I first had his incomparable aid in the
20,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.,understanding of it. During the last year of his life he read the
21,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.,"proofs of this volume, to what great advantage to my work may readily"
22,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.,be conceived.
23,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.,
24,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.,"When, in the early summer of this year, the printing of the Purgatory"
25,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.,"began, though illness made it an exertion to him, he continued this act"
26,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.,"of friendship, and did not cease till, at the fifth canto, he laid down"
27,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.,the pencil forever from his dear and honored hand.

205,INTRODUCTION.,INTRODUCTION.
206,INTRODUCTION.,
207,INTRODUCTION.,
208,INTRODUCTION.,So many versions of the Divine Comedy exist in English that a new one
209,INTRODUCTION.,"might well seem needless. But most of these translations are in verse,"
210,INTRODUCTION.,and the intellectual temper of our time is impatient of a transmutation
211,INTRODUCTION.,"in which substance is sacrificed for form’s sake, and the new form is"
212,INTRODUCTION.,itself different from the original. The conditions of verse in
213,INTRODUCTION.,different languages vary so widely as to make any versified translation
214,INTRODUCTION.,of a poem but an imperfect reproduction of the archetype. It is like an
215,INTRODUCTION.,"imperfect mirror that renders but a partial likeness, in which"
216,INTRODUCTION.,"essential features are blurred or distorted. Dante himself, the first"
217,INTRODUCTION.,"modern critic, declared that “nothing harmonized by a musical bond can"
218,INTRODUCTION.,be transmuted from its own speech without losing all its sweetness and
219,INTRODUCTION.,"harmony,” and every fresh attempt at translation affords a new proof of"
220,INTRODUCTION.,the truth of his assertion. Each language exhibits its own special
221,INTRODUCTION.,genius in its poetic forms. Even when they are closely similar in
222,INTRODUCTION.,"rhythmical method their poetic effect is essentially different, their"
223,INTRODUCTION.,individuality is distinct. The hexameter of the Iliad is not the
224,INTRODUCTION.,hexameter of the Aeneid. And if this be the case in respect to related
225,INTRODUCTION.,"forms, it is even more obvious in respect to forms peculiar to one"
226,INTRODUCTION.,"language, like the terza rima of the Italian, for which it is"
227,INTRODUCTION.,impossible to find a satisfactory equivalent in another tongue.
228,INTRODUCTION.,
229,INTRODUCTION.,"If, then, the attempt be vain to reproduce the form or to represent its"
230,INTRODUCTION.,"effect in a translation, yet the substance of a poem may have such"
231,INTRODUCTION.,worth that it deserves to be known by readers who must read it in their
232,INTRODUCTION.,own tongue or not at all. In this case the aim of the translator should
233,INTRODUCTION.,"be to render the substance fully, exactly, and with as close a"
234,INTRODUCTION.,correspondence to the tone and style of the original as is possible
235,INTRODUCTION.,"between prose and poetry. Of the charm, of the power of the poem such a"
236,INTRODUCTION.,translation can give but an inadequate suggestion; the musical bond was
237,INTRODUCTION.,"of its essence, and the loss of the musical bond is the loss of the"
238,INTRODUCTION.,"beauty to which form and substance mutually contributed, and in which"
239,INTRODUCTION.,they were both alike harmonized and sublimated. The rhythmic life of
240,INTRODUCTION.,"the original is its vital spirit, and the translation losing this vital"
241,INTRODUCTION.,spirit is at best as the dull plaster cast to the living marble or the
242,INTRODUCTION.,breathing bronze. The intellectual substance is there; and if the work
243,INTRODUCTION.,"be good, something of the emotional quality may be conveyed; the"
244,INTRODUCTION.,"imagination may mould the prose as it moulded the verse,—but, after"
245,INTRODUCTION.,"all, “translations are but as turn-coated things at best,” as Howell"
246,INTRODUCTION.,said in one of his Familiar Letters.
247,INTRODUCTION.,
248,INTRODUCTION.,No poem in any tongue is more informed with rhythmic life than the
249,INTRODUCTION.,"Divine Comedy. And yet, such is its extraordinary distinction, no poem"
250,INTRODUCTION.,has an intellectual and emotional substance more independent of its
251,INTRODUCTION.,"metrical form. Its complex structure, its elaborate measure and rhyme,"
252,INTRODUCTION.,"highly artificial as they are, are so mastered by the genius of the"
253,INTRODUCTION.,poet as to become the most natural expression of the spirit by which
254,INTRODUCTION.,the poem is inspired; while at the same time the thought and sentiment
255,INTRODUCTION.,"embodied in the verse is of such import, and the narrative of such"
256,INTRODUCTION.,"interest, that they do not lose their worth when expressed in the prose"
257,INTRODUCTION.,"of another tongue; they still have power to quicken imagination, and to"
258,INTRODUCTION.,evoke sympathy.
259,INTRODUCTION.,
260,INTRODUCTION.,"In English there is an excellent prose translation of the Inferno, by"
261,INTRODUCTION.,"Dr. John Carlyle, a man well known to the reader of his brother’s"
262,INTRODUCTION.,"Correspondence. It was published forty years ago, but it is still"
263,INTRODUCTION.,"contemporaneous enough in style to answer every need, and had Dr."
264,INTRODUCTION.,Carlyle made a version of the whole poem I should hardly have cared to
265,INTRODUCTION.,attempt a new one. In my translation of the Inferno I am often Dr.
266,INTRODUCTION.,Carlyle’s debtor. His conception of what a translation should be is
267,INTRODUCTION.,very much the same as my own. Of the Purgatorio there is a prose
268,INTRODUCTION.,"version which has excellent qualities, by Mr. W. S. Dugdale. Another"
269,INTRODUCTION.,"version of great merit, of both the Purgatorio and Paradiso, is that of"
270,INTRODUCTION.,Mr. A. J. Butler. It is accompanied by a scholarly and valuable
271,INTRODUCTION.,"comment, and I owe much to Mr. Butler’s work. But through what seems to"
272,INTRODUCTION.,me occasional excess of literal fidelity his English is now and then
273,INTRODUCTION.,"somewhat crabbed. “He overacts the office of an interpreter,” I cite"
274,INTRODUCTION.,"again from Howell, “who doth enslave himself too strictly to words or"
275,INTRODUCTION.,phrases. One may be so over-punctual in words that he may mar the
276,INTRODUCTION.,matter.”
277,INTRODUCTION.,
278,INTRODUCTION.,I have tried to be as literal in my translation as was consistent with
279,INTRODUCTION.,"good English, and to render Dante’s own words in words as nearly"
280,INTRODUCTION.,correspondent to them as the difference in the languages would permit.
281,INTRODUCTION.,But it is to be remembered that the familiar uses and subtle
282,INTRODUCTION.,associations which give to words their full meaning are never
283,INTRODUCTION.,absolutely the same in two languages. Love in English not only SOUNDS
284,INTRODUCTION.,"but IS different from amor in Latin, or amore in Italian. Even the most"
285,INTRODUCTION.,felicitous prose translation must fail therefore at times to afford the
286,INTRODUCTION.,entire and precise meaning of the original.
287,INTRODUCTION.,
288,INTRODUCTION.,"Moreover, there are difficulties in Dante’s poem for Italians, and"
289,INTRODUCTION.,"there are difficulties in the translation for English readers. These,"
290,INTRODUCTION.,"where it seemed needful, I have endeavored to explain in brief"
291,INTRODUCTION.,footnotes. But I have desired to avoid distracting the attention of the
292,INTRODUCTION.,"reader from the narrative, and have mainly left the understanding of it"
293,INTRODUCTION.,to his good sense and perspicacity. The clearness of Dante’s
294,INTRODUCTION.,"imaginative vision is so complete, and the character of his narration"
295,INTRODUCTION.,"of it so direct and simple, that the difficulties in understanding his"
296,INTRODUCTION.,intention are comparatively few.
297,INTRODUCTION.,
298,INTRODUCTION.,It is a noticeable fact that in by far the greater number of passages
299,INTRODUCTION.,"where a doubt in regard to the interpretation exists, the obscurity"
300,INTRODUCTION.,lies in the rhyme-word. For with all the abundant resources of the
301,INTRODUCTION.,"Italian tongue in rhyme, and with all Dante’s mastery of them, the"
302,INTRODUCTION.,truth still is that his triple rhyme often compelled him to exact from
303,INTRODUCTION.,words such service as they did not naturally render and as no other
304,INTRODUCTION.,"poet had required of them. The compiler of the Ottimo Commento records,"
305,INTRODUCTION.,"in an often-cited passage, that “I, the writer, heard Dante say that"
306,INTRODUCTION.,"never a rhyme had led him to say other than he would, but that many a"
307,INTRODUCTION.,time and oft he had made words say for him what they were not wont to
308,INTRODUCTION.,"express for other poets.” The sentence has a double truth, for it"
309,INTRODUCTION.,indicates not only Dante’s incomparable power to compel words to give
310,INTRODUCTION.,"out their full meaning, but also his invention of new uses for them,"
311,INTRODUCTION.,his employment of them in unusual significations or in forms hardly
312,INTRODUCTION.,elsewhere to be found. These devices occasionally interfere with the
313,INTRODUCTION.,"limpid flow of his diction, but the difficulties of interpretation to"
314,INTRODUCTION.,which they give rise serve rather to mark the prevailing clearness and
315,INTRODUCTION.,simplicity of his expression than seriously to impede its easy and
316,INTRODUCTION.,unperplexed current. There are few sentences in the Divina Commedia in
317,INTRODUCTION.,which a difficulty is occasioned by lack of definiteness of thought or
318,INTRODUCTION.,distinctness of image.
319,INTRODUCTION.,
320,INTRODUCTION.,A far deeper-lying and more pervading source of imperfect comprehension
321,INTRODUCTION.,of the poem than any verbal difficulty exists in the double or triple
322,INTRODUCTION.,meaning that runs through it. The narrative of the poet’s spiritual
323,INTRODUCTION.,journey is so vivid and consistent that it has all the reality of an
324,INTRODUCTION.,account of an actual experience; but within and beneath runs a stream
325,INTRODUCTION.,of allegory not less consistent and hardly less continuous than the
326,INTRODUCTION.,narrative itself. To the illustration and carrying out of this interior
327,INTRODUCTION.,meaning even the minutest details of external incident are made to
328,INTRODUCTION.,"contribute, with an appropriateness of significance, and with a freedom"
329,INTRODUCTION.,from forced interpretation or artificiality of construction such as no
330,INTRODUCTION.,other writer of allegory has succeeded in attaining. The poem may be
331,INTRODUCTION.,read with interest as a record of experience without attention to its
332,INTRODUCTION.,"inner meaning, but its full interest is only felt when this inner"
333,INTRODUCTION.,"meaning is traced, and the moral significance of the incidents of the"
334,INTRODUCTION.,story apprehended by the alert intelligence. The allegory is the soul
335,INTRODUCTION.,"of the poem, but like the soul within the body it does not show itself"
336,INTRODUCTION.,"in independent existence. It is, in scholastic phrase, the form of the"
337,INTRODUCTION.,"body, giving to it its special individuality. Thus in order truly to"
338,INTRODUCTION.,understand and rightly appreciate the poem the reader must follow its
339,INTRODUCTION.,"course with a double intelligence. “Taken literally,” as Dante declares"
340,INTRODUCTION.,"in his Letter to Can Grande, “the subject is the state of the soul"
341,INTRODUCTION.,"after death, simply considered. But, allegorically taken, its subject"
342,INTRODUCTION.,"is man, according as by his good or ill deserts he renders himself"
343,INTRODUCTION.,liable to the reward or punishment of Justice.” It is the allegory of
344,INTRODUCTION.,"human life; and not of human life as an abstraction, but of the"
345,INTRODUCTION.,"individual life; and herein, as Mr. Lowell, whose phrase I borrow, has"
346,INTRODUCTION.,"said, “lie its profound meaning and its permanent force.”[1] And herein"
347,INTRODUCTION.,"too lie its perennial freshness of interest, and the actuality which"
348,INTRODUCTION.,makes it contemporaneous with every successive generation. The increase
349,INTRODUCTION.,"of knowledge, the loss of belief in doctrines that were fundamental in"
350,INTRODUCTION.,"Dante’s creed, the changes in the order of society, the new thoughts of"
351,INTRODUCTION.,"the world, have not lessened the moral import of the poem, any more"
352,INTRODUCTION.,than they have lessened its excellence as a work of art. Its real
353,INTRODUCTION.,"substance is as independent as its artistic beauty, of science, of"
354,INTRODUCTION.,"creed, and of institutions. Human nature has not changed; the motives"
355,INTRODUCTION.,"of action are the same, though their relative force and the desires and"
356,INTRODUCTION.,ideals by which they are inspired vary from generation to generation.
357,INTRODUCTION.,And thus it is that the moral judgments of life framed by a great poet
358,INTRODUCTION.,"whose imagination penetrates to the core of things, and who, from his"
359,INTRODUCTION.,"very nature as poet, conceives and sets forth the issues of life not in"
360,INTRODUCTION.,"a treatise of abstract morality, but by means of sensible types and"
361,INTRODUCTION.,"images, never lose interest, and have a perpetual contemporaneousness."
362,INTRODUCTION.,They deal with the permanent and unalterable elements of the soul of
363,INTRODUCTION.,man.
364,INTRODUCTION.,
365,INTRODUCTION.,[1] Mr. Lowell’s essay on Dante makes other writing about the poet or
366,INTRODUCTION.,the poem seem ineffectual and superfluous. I must assume that it will
367,INTRODUCTION.,"be familiar to the readers of my version, at least to those among them"
368,INTRODUCTION.,who desire truly to understand the Divine Comedy.
369,INTRODUCTION.,
370,INTRODUCTION.,
371,INTRODUCTION.,"The scene of the poem is the spiritual world, of which we are members"
372,INTRODUCTION.,even while still denizens of the world of time. In the spiritual world
373,INTRODUCTION.,"the results of sin or perverted love, and of virtue or right love, in"
374,INTRODUCTION.,"this life of probation, are manifest. The life to come is but the"
375,INTRODUCTION.,fulfilment of the life that now is. This is the truth that Dante sought
376,INTRODUCTION.,to enforce. The allegory in which he cloaked it is of a character that
377,INTRODUCTION.,separates the Divine Comedy from all other works of similar intent. In
378,INTRODUCTION.,"The Pilgrim’s Progress, for example, the personages introduced are mere"
379,INTRODUCTION.,"simulacra of men and women, the types of moral qualities or religious"
380,INTRODUCTION.,dispositions. They are abstractions which the genius of Bunyan fails to
381,INTRODUCTION.,inform with vitality sufficient to kindle the imagination of the reader
382,INTRODUCTION.,"with a sense of their actual, living and breathing existence. But in"
383,INTRODUCTION.,"the Divine Comedy the personages are all from real life, they are men"
384,INTRODUCTION.,"and women with their natural passions and emotions, and they are"
385,INTRODUCTION.,undergoing an actual experience. The allegory consists in making their
386,INTRODUCTION.,"characters and their fates, what all human characters and fates really"
387,INTRODUCTION.,"are, the types and images of spiritual law. Virgil and Beatrice, whose"
388,INTRODUCTION.,nature as depicted in the poem makes nearest approach to purely
389,INTRODUCTION.,"abstract and typical existence, are always consistently presented as"
390,INTRODUCTION.,"living individuals, exalted indeed in wisdom and power, but with hardly"
391,INTRODUCTION.,less definite and concrete humanity than that of Dante himself.
392,INTRODUCTION.,
393,INTRODUCTION.,The scheme of the created Universe held by the Christians of the Middle
394,INTRODUCTION.,"Ages was comparatively simple, and so definite that Dante, in accepting"
395,INTRODUCTION.,"it in its main features without modification, was provided with the"
396,INTRODUCTION.,"limited stage that was requisite for his design, and of which the"
397,INTRODUCTION.,general disposition was familiar to all his readers. The three
398,INTRODUCTION.,spiritual realms had their local bounds marked out as clearly as those
399,INTRODUCTION.,of time earth itself. Their cosmography was but an extension of the
400,INTRODUCTION.,largely hypothetical geography of the tune.
401,INTRODUCTION.,
402,INTRODUCTION.,"The Earth was the centre of the Universe, and its northern hemisphere"
403,INTRODUCTION.,was the abode of man. At the middle point of this hemisphere stood
404,INTRODUCTION.,"Jerusalem, equidistant from the Pillars of Hercules on the West, and"
405,INTRODUCTION.,the Ganges on the East.
406,INTRODUCTION.,
407,INTRODUCTION.,"Within the body of this hemisphere was hell, shared as a vast cone, of"
408,INTRODUCTION.,"which the apex was the centre of the globe; and here, according to"
409,INTRODUCTION.,"Dante, was the seat of Lucifer. The concave of Hell had been formed by"
410,INTRODUCTION.,"his fall, when a portion of the solid earth, through fear of him, ran"
411,INTRODUCTION.,"back to the southern uninhabited hemisphere, and formed there, directly"
412,INTRODUCTION.,"antipodal to Jerusalem, the mountain of Purgatory which rose from the"
413,INTRODUCTION.,waste of waters that covered this half of the globe. Purgatory was
414,INTRODUCTION.,"shaped as a cone, of similar dimensions to that of Hell, amid at its"
415,INTRODUCTION.,summit was the Terrestrial Paradise.
416,INTRODUCTION.,
417,INTRODUCTION.,Immediately surrounding the atmosphere of the Earth was the sphere of
418,INTRODUCTION.,"elemental fire. Around this was the Heaven of the Moon, and encircling"
419,INTRODUCTION.,"this, in order, were the Heavens of Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars,"
420,INTRODUCTION.,"Jove, Saturn, the Fixed Stars, and the Crystalline or first moving"
421,INTRODUCTION.,Heaven. These nine concentric Heavens revolved continually around the
422,INTRODUCTION.,"Earth, and in proportion to their distance from it was time greater"
423,INTRODUCTION.,"swiftness of each. Encircling all was the Empyrean, increate,"
424,INTRODUCTION.,"incorporeal, motionless, unbounded in time or space, the proper seat of"
425,INTRODUCTION.,"God, the home of the Angels, the abode of the Elect."
426,INTRODUCTION.,
427,INTRODUCTION.,"The Angelic Hierarchy consisted of nine orders, corresponding to the"
428,INTRODUCTION.,nine moving heavens. Their blessedness and the swiftness of time motion
429,INTRODUCTION.,with which in unending delight they circled around God were in
430,INTRODUCTION.,"proportion to their nearness to Him, —first the Seraphs, then the"
431,INTRODUCTION.,"Cherubs, Thrones, Dominations, Virtues, Powers, Princes, Archangels,"
432,INTRODUCTION.,"and Angels. Through them, under the general name of Intelligences, the"
433,INTRODUCTION.,"Divine influence was transmitted to the Heavens, giving to them their"
434,INTRODUCTION.,"circular motion, which was the expression of their longing to be united"
435,INTRODUCTION.,with the source of their creation. The Heavens in their turn streamed
436,INTRODUCTION.,"down upon the Earth the Divine influence thus distributed among them,"
437,INTRODUCTION.,"in varying proportion and power, producing divers effects in the"
438,INTRODUCTION.,"generation and corruption of material things, and in the dispositions"
439,INTRODUCTION.,and the lives of men.
440,INTRODUCTION.,
441,INTRODUCTION.,Such was the general scheme of the Universe. The intention of God in
442,INTRODUCTION.,its creation was to communicate of his own perfection to the creatures
443,INTRODUCTION.,"endowed with souls, that is, to men and to angels, and the proper end"
444,INTRODUCTION.,of every such creature was to seek its own perfection in likeness to
445,INTRODUCTION.,the Divine. This end was attained through that knowledge of God of
446,INTRODUCTION.,"which the soul was capable, and through love which was in proportion to"
447,INTRODUCTION.,knowledge. Virtue depended on the free will of man; it was the good use
448,INTRODUCTION.,of that will directed to a right object of love. Two lights were given
449,INTRODUCTION.,to the soul for guidance of the will: the light of reason for natural
450,INTRODUCTION.,things and for the direction of the will to moral virtue the light of
451,INTRODUCTION.,"grace for things supernatural, and for the direction of the will to"
452,INTRODUCTION.,"spiritual virtue. Sin was the opposite of virtue, the choice by the"
453,INTRODUCTION.,"will of false objects of love; it involved the misuse of reason, and"
454,INTRODUCTION.,"the absence of grace. As the end of virtue was blessedness, so the end"
455,INTRODUCTION.,of sin was misery.
456,INTRODUCTION.,
457,INTRODUCTION.,The cornerstone of Dante’s moral system was the Freedom of the Will; in
458,INTRODUCTION.,"other words, the right of private judgment with the condition of"
459,INTRODUCTION.,"accountability. This is the liberty which Dante, that is man, goes"
460,INTRODUCTION.,seeking in his journey through the spiritual world. This liberty is to
461,INTRODUCTION.,"be attained through the right use of reason, illuminated by Divine"
462,INTRODUCTION.,Grace; it consists in the perfect accord of the will of man with the
463,INTRODUCTION.,will of God.
464,INTRODUCTION.,
465,INTRODUCTION.,With this view of the nature and end of man Dante’s conception of the
466,INTRODUCTION.,history of the race could not be other than that its course was
467,INTRODUCTION.,providentially ordered. The fall of man had made him a just object of
468,INTRODUCTION.,"the vengeance of God; but the elect were to be redeemed, and for their"
469,INTRODUCTION.,redemption the history of the world from the beginning was directed.
470,INTRODUCTION.,"Not only in his dealings with the Jews, but in his dealings with the"
471,INTRODUCTION.,"heathen was God preparing for the reconciliation of man, to be finally"
472,INTRODUCTION.,accomplished in his sacrifice of Himself for them. The Roman Empire was
473,INTRODUCTION.,foreordained and established for this end. It was to prepare the way
474,INTRODUCTION.,for the establishment of the Roman Church. It was the appointed
475,INTRODUCTION.,instrument for the political government of men. Empire and Church were
476,INTRODUCTION.,alike divine institutions for the guidance of man on earth.
477,INTRODUCTION.,
478,INTRODUCTION.,The aim of Dante in the Divine Comedy was to set forth these truths in
479,INTRODUCTION.,"such wise as to affect the imaginations and touch the hearts of men, so"
480,INTRODUCTION.,that they should turn to righteousness. His conviction of these truths
481,INTRODUCTION.,was no mere matter of belief; it had the ardor and certainty of faith.
482,INTRODUCTION.,They had appeared to him in all their fulness as a revelation of the
483,INTRODUCTION.,"Divine wisdom. It was his work as poet, as poet with a divine"
484,INTRODUCTION.,"commission, to make this revelation known. His work was a work of"
485,INTRODUCTION.,faith; it was sacred; to it both Heaven and Earth had set their hands.
486,INTRODUCTION.,
487,INTRODUCTION.,"To this work, as I have said, the definiteness and the limits of the"
488,INTRODUCTION.,generally accepted theory of the Universe gave the required frame. The
489,INTRODUCTION.,very narrowness of this scheme made Dante’s design practicable. He had
490,INTRODUCTION.,had the experience of a man on earth. He had been lured by false
491,INTRODUCTION.,"objects of desire from the pursuit of the true good. But Divine Grace,"
492,INTRODUCTION.,"in the form of Beatrice, who had of old on earth led him aright, now"
493,INTRODUCTION.,"intervened and sent to his aid Virgil, who, as the type of Human"
494,INTRODUCTION.,"Reason, should bring him safe through Hell, showing to him the eternal"
495,INTRODUCTION.,"consequences of sin, and then should conduct him, penitent, up the"
496,INTRODUCTION.,"height of Purgatory, till on its summit, in the Earthly Paradise,"
497,INTRODUCTION.,"Beatrice should appear once more to him. Thence she, as the type of"
498,INTRODUCTION.,"that knowledge through which comes the love of God, should lead him,"
499,INTRODUCTION.,"through the Heavens up to the Empyrean, to the consummation of his"
500,INTRODUCTION.,course in the actual vision of God.

567,CANTO I.,"Midway upon the road of our life I found myself within a dark wood, for"
568,CANTO I.,the right way had been missed. Ah! how hard a thing it is to tell what
569,CANTO I.,"this wild and rough and dense wood was, which in thought renews the"

571,CANTO I.,"of the good that there I found, I will tell of the other things that I"
572,CANTO I.,"have seen there. I cannot well recount how I entered it, so full was I"
573,CANTO I.,of slumber at that point where I abandoned the true way. But after I
574,CANTO I.,"had arrived at the foot of a hill, where that valley ended which had"
575,CANTO I.,"pierced my heart with fear, I looked on high, and saw its shoulders"
576,CANTO I.,clothed already with the rays of the planet[1] that leadeth men aright
577,CANTO I.,along every path. Then was the fear a little quieted which in the lake
578,CANTO I.,of my heart had lasted through the night that I passed so piteously.
579,CANTO I.,"And even as one who with spent breath, issued out of the sea upon the"

597,CANTO I.,the sweet season were occasion of good hope to me concerning that wild
598,CANTO I.,beast with the dappled skin. But not so that the sight which appeared
599,CANTO I.,to me of a lion did not give me fear. He seemed to be coming against
600,CANTO I.,"me, with head high and with ravening hunger, so that it seemed that the"
601,CANTO I.,"air was affrighted at him. And a she-wolf,[2] who with all cravings"

655,CANTO I.,be a soul more worthy than I for that. With her I will leave thee at my

693,CANTO II.,Silvius while still corruptible went to the immortal world and was
694,CANTO II.,there in the body. Wherefore if the Adversary of every ill was then

698,CANTO II.,of revered Rome and of her empire; both which (to say truth indeed)
699,CANTO II.,were ordained for the holy place where the successor of the greater

723,CANTO II.,"those who are suspended,[1] and a Lady called me, so blessed and"

725,CANTO II.,"than the star, and she began to speak to me sweet and low, with angelic"
726,CANTO II.,"voice, in her own tongue: ‘O courteous Mantuan soul, of whom the fame"

730,CANTO II.,"through that which I have heard of him in heaven, lest already he be so"

733,CANTO II.,"deliverance, assist him so that I may be consoled for him. I am"
734,CANTO II.,Beatrice who make thee go. I come from a place whither I desire to
735,CANTO II.,"return. Love moved me, and makes me speak. When I shall be before my"
736,CANTO II.,"Lord, I will commend thee often unto Him.’ Then she was silent, and"

739,CANTO II.,smallest circles![2] so pleasing unto me is thy command that to obey

743,CANTO II.,place whither thou burnest to return.’ ‘Since thou wishest to know so
744,CANTO II.,"inwardly, I will tell thee briefly,’ she replied to me, ‘wherefore I"
745,CANTO II.,fear not to come here within. One ought to fear those things only that

749,CANTO II.,"in heaven who hath pity for this hindrance whereto I send thee, so that"
750,CANTO II.,stern judgment there above she breaketh. She summoned Lucia in her
751,CANTO II.,"request, and said, “Thy faithful one now hath need of thee, and unto"
752,CANTO II.,"thee I commend him.” Lucia, the foe of every cruel one, rose and came"
753,CANTO II.,"to the place where I was, seated with the ancient Rachel. She said,"
754,CANTO II.,"“Beatrice, true praise of God, why dost thou not succor him who so"
755,CANTO II.,loved thee that for thee he came forth from the vulgar throng? Dost
756,CANTO II.,thou not hear the pity of his plaint? Dost thou not see the death that
757,CANTO II.,combats him beside the stream whereof the sea hath no vaunt?” In the
758,CANTO II.,"world never were persons swift to seek their good, and to fly their"
759,CANTO II.,"harm, as I, after these words were uttered, came here below, from my"
760,CANTO II.,"blessed seat, putting my trust in thy upright speech, which honors thee"
761,CANTO II.,"and them who have heard it.’ After she had said this to me, weeping she"
762,CANTO II.,"turned her lucent eyes, whereby she made me more speedy in coming. And"
763,CANTO II.,I came to thee as she willed. Thee have I delivered from that wild
764,CANTO II.,beast that took from thee the short ascent of the beautiful mountain.
765,CANTO II.,"What is it then? Why, why dost thou hold back? why dost thou harbor"
766,CANTO II.,"such cowardice in thy heart? why hast thou not daring and boldness,"
767,CANTO II.,"since three blessed Ladies care for thee in the court of Heaven, and my"
768,CANTO II.,speech pledges thee such good?”
769,CANTO II.,

779,CANTO II.,"As flowerets, bent and closed by the chill of night, after the sun"
780,CANTO II.,"shines on them straighten themselves all open on their stem, so I"
781,CANTO II.,"became with my weak virtue, and such good daring hastened to my heart"
782,CANTO II.,that I began like one enfranchised: “Oh compassionate she who succored
783,CANTO II.,me! and thou courteous who didst speedily obey the true words that she
784,CANTO II.,addressed to thee! Thou by thy words hast so disposed my heart with
785,CANTO II.,"desire of going, that I have returned unto my first intent. Go on now,"
786,CANTO II.,"for one sole will is in us both: Thou Leader, thou Lord, and thou"
787,CANTO II.,"Master.” Thus I said to him; and when he had moved on, I entered along"
788,CANTO II.,the deep and savage road.

803,CANTO III.,"my lofty maker: the divine Power, the supreme Wisdom and the primal"
804,CANTO III.,"Love made me. Before me were no things created, unless eternal, and I"
805,CANTO III.,"eternal last. Leave every hope, ye who enter!”"
806,CANTO III.,
807,CANTO III.,These words of color obscure I saw written at the top of a gate;
808,CANTO III.,"whereat I, “Master, their meaning is dire to me.”"
809,CANTO III.,
810,CANTO III.,"And he to me, like one who knew, “Here it behoves to leave every fear;"
811,CANTO III.,it behoves that all cowardice should here be dead. We have come to the
812,CANTO III.,"place where I have told thee that thou shalt see the woeful people, who"
813,CANTO III.,have lost the good of the understanding.”
814,CANTO III.,
815,CANTO III.,"And when he had put his hand on mine, with a glad countenance,"
816,CANTO III.,"wherefrom I took courage, he brought me within the secret things. Here"
817,CANTO III.,"sighs, laments, and deep wailings were resounding though the starless"
818,CANTO III.,"air; wherefore at first I wept thereat. Strange tongues, horrible"
819,CANTO III.,"cries, words of woe, accents of anger, voices high and hoarse, and"
820,CANTO III.,"sounds of hands with them, were making a tumult which whirls forever in"
821,CANTO III.,"that air dark without change, like the sand when the whirlwind"
822,CANTO III.,breathes.
823,CANTO III.,
824,CANTO III.,"And I, who had my head girt with horror, said, “Master, what is it that"
825,CANTO III.,I hear? and what folk are they who seem in woe so vanquished?”
826,CANTO III.,
827,CANTO III.,"And he to me, “This miserable measure the wretched souls maintain of"
828,CANTO III.,those who lived without infamy and without praise. Mingled are they
829,CANTO III.,"with that caitiff choir of the angels, who were not rebels, nor were"
830,CANTO III.,"faithful to God, but were for themselves. The heavens chased them out"
831,CANTO III.,"in order to be not less beautiful, nor doth the depth of Hell receive"
832,CANTO III.,"them, because the damned would have some glory from them.”"
833,CANTO III.,
834,CANTO III.,"And I, “Master, what is so grievous to them, that makes them lament so"
835,CANTO III.,bitterly?”
836,CANTO III.,
837,CANTO III.,"He answered, “I will tell thee very briefly. These have no hope of"
838,CANTO III.,"death; and their blind life is so debased, that they are envious of"
839,CANTO III.,every other lot. Fame of them the world permitteth not to be; mercy and
840,CANTO III.,"justice disdain them. Let us not speak of them, but do thou look and"
841,CANTO III.,pass on.”
842,CANTO III.,
843,CANTO III.,"And I, who was gazing, saw a banner, that whirling ran so swiftly that"
844,CANTO III.,"it seemed to me to scorn all repose, and behind it came so long a train"
845,CANTO III.,"of folk, that I could never have believed death had undone so many."
846,CANTO III.,"After I had distinguished some among them, I saw and knew the shade of"
847,CANTO III.,"him who made, through cowardice, the great refusal.[1] At once I"
848,CANTO III.,"understood and was certain, that this was the sect of the caitiffs"
849,CANTO III.,"displeasing unto God, and unto his enemies. These wretches, who never"
850,CANTO III.,"were alive, were naked, and much stung by gad-flies and by wasps that"
851,CANTO III.,"were there. These streaked their faces with blood, which, mingled with"
852,CANTO III.,"tears, was harvested at their feet by loathsome worms."
853,CANTO III.,
854,CANTO III.,[1] Who is intended by these words is uncertain.
855,CANTO III.,
856,CANTO III.,
857,CANTO III.,"And when I gave myself to looking onward, I saw people on the bank of a"
858,CANTO III.,"great river; wherefore I said, “Master, now grant to me that I may know"
859,CANTO III.,"who these are, and what rule makes them appear so ready to pass over,"
860,CANTO III.,"as I discern through the faint light.” And he to me, “The things will"
861,CANTO III.,"be clear to thee, when we shall set our steps on the sad marge of"
862,CANTO III.,"Acheron.” Then with eyes bashful and cast down, fearing lest my speech"
863,CANTO III.,"had been irksome to him, far as to the river I refrained from speaking."
864,CANTO III.,
865,CANTO III.,"And lo! coming toward us in a boat, an old man, white with ancient"
866,CANTO III.,"hair, crying, “Woe to you, wicked souls! hope not ever to see Heaven! I"
867,CANTO III.,"come to carry you to the other bank, into eternal darkness, to heat and"
868,CANTO III.,"frost. And thou who art there, living soul, depart from these that are"
869,CANTO III.,"dead.” But when he saw that I did not depart, he said, “By another way,"
870,CANTO III.,"by other ports thou shalt come to the shore, not here, for passage; it"
871,CANTO III.,behoves that a lighter bark bear thee.”[1]
872,CANTO III.,
873,CANTO III.,[1] The boat that bears the souls to Purgatory. Charon recognizes that
874,CANTO III.,Dante is not among the damned.
875,CANTO III.,
876,CANTO III.,
877,CANTO III.,"And my Leader to him, “Charon, vex not thyself, it is thus willed there"
878,CANTO III.,where is power to do that which is willed; and farther ask not.” Then
879,CANTO III.,"the fleecy cheeks were quiet of the pilot of the livid marsh, who round"
880,CANTO III.,about his eyes had wheels of flame.
881,CANTO III.,
882,CANTO III.,"But those souls, who were weary and naked, changed color, and gnashed"
883,CANTO III.,their teeth soon as they heard his cruel words. They blasphemed God and
884,CANTO III.,"their parents, the human race, the place, the time and the seed of"
885,CANTO III.,"their sowing and of their birth. Then, bitterly weeping, they drew back"
886,CANTO III.,"all of them together to the evil bank, that waits for every man who"
887,CANTO III.,"fears not God. Charon the demon, with eyes of glowing coal, beckoning"
888,CANTO III.,"them, collects them all; he beats with his oar whoever lingers."
889,CANTO III.,
890,CANTO III.,"As in autumn the leaves fall off one after the other, till the bough"
891,CANTO III.,"sees all its spoils upon the earth, in like wise the evil seed of Adam"
892,CANTO III.,"throw themselves from that shore one by one at signals, as the bird at"
893,CANTO III.,"his call. Thus they go over the dusky wave, and before they have landed"
894,CANTO III.,"on the farther side, already on this a new throng is gathered."
895,CANTO III.,
896,CANTO III.,"“My son,” said the courteous Master, “those who die in the wrath of"
897,CANTO III.,"God, all meet together here from every land. And they are eager to pass"
898,CANTO III.,"over the stream, for the divine justice spurs them, so that fear is"
899,CANTO III.,turned to desire. This way a good soul never passes; and therefore if
900,CANTO III.,"Charon snarleth at thee, thou now mayest well know what his speech"
901,CANTO III.,"signifies.” This ended, the dark plain trembled so mightily, that the"
902,CANTO III.,memory of the terror even now bathes me with sweat. The tearful land
903,CANTO III.,gave forth a wind that flashed a vermilion light which vanquished every
904,CANTO III.,"sense of mine, and I fell as a man whom slumber seizes."

919,CANTO IV.,"A heavy thunder broke the deep sleep in my head, so that I started up"
920,CANTO IV.,"like a person who by force is wakened. And risen erect, I moved my"
921,CANTO IV.,"rested eye round about, and looked fixedly to distinguish the place"
922,CANTO IV.,"where I was. True it is, that I found myself on the verge of the valley"
923,CANTO IV.,"of the woeful abyss that gathers in thunder of infinite wailings. Dark,"
924,CANTO IV.,"profound it was, and cloudy, so that though I fixed my sight on the"
925,CANTO IV.,bottom I did not discern anything there.
926,CANTO IV.,
927,CANTO IV.,"“Now we descend down here into the blind world,” began the Poet all"
928,CANTO IV.,"deadly pale, “I will be first, and thou shalt be second.”"
929,CANTO IV.,
930,CANTO IV.,"And I, who had observed his color, said, “How shall I come, if thou"
931,CANTO IV.,"fearest, who art wont to be a comfort to my doubting?” And he to me,"
932,CANTO IV.,“The anguish of the folk who are down here depicts upon my face that
933,CANTO IV.,"pity which thou takest for fear. Let us go on, for the long way urges"
934,CANTO IV.,us.”
935,CANTO IV.,
936,CANTO IV.,"So he set forth, and so he made me enter within the first circle that"
937,CANTO IV.,"girds the abyss. Here, so far as could be heard, there was no plaint"
938,CANTO IV.,but that of sighs which made the eternal air to tremble: this came of
939,CANTO IV.,"the woe without torments felt by the crowds, which were many and great,"
940,CANTO IV.,of infants and of women and of men.
941,CANTO IV.,
942,CANTO IV.,"The good Master to me, “Thou dost not ask what spirits are these that"
943,CANTO IV.,"thou seest. Now I would have thee know, before thou goest farther, that"
944,CANTO IV.,"they sinned not; and if they have merits it sufficeth not, because they"
945,CANTO IV.,"had not baptism, which is part of the faith that thou believest; and if"
946,CANTO IV.,"they were before Christianity, they did not duly worship God: and of"
947,CANTO IV.,"such as these am I myself. Through such defects, and not through other"
948,CANTO IV.,"guilt, are we lost, and only so far harmed that without hope we live in"
949,CANTO IV.,desire.”
950,CANTO IV.,
951,CANTO IV.,"Great woe seized me at my heart when I heard him, because I knew that"
952,CANTO IV.,"people of much worth were suspended in that limbo. “Tell me, my Master,"
953,CANTO IV.,"tell me, Lord,” began I, with wish to be assured of that faith which"
954,CANTO IV.,"vanquishes every error,[1] “did ever any one who afterwards was blessed"
955,CANTO IV.,"go out from here, either by his own or by another’s merit?” And he, who"
956,CANTO IV.,"understood my covert speech, answered, “I was new in this state when I"
957,CANTO IV.,saw a Mighty One come hither crowned with sign of victory. He drew out
958,CANTO IV.,"hence the shade of the first parent, of Abel his son, and that of Noah,"
959,CANTO IV.,"of Moses the law-giver and obedient, Abraham the patriarch, and David"
960,CANTO IV.,"the King, Israel with his father, and with his offspring, and with"
961,CANTO IV.,"Rachel, for whom he did so much, and others many; and He made them"
962,CANTO IV.,"blessed: and I would have thee know that before these, human spirits"
963,CANTO IV.,were not saved.”
964,CANTO IV.,
965,CANTO IV.,[1] Wishing especially to be assured in regard to the descent of Christ
966,CANTO IV.,into Hell.
967,CANTO IV.,
968,CANTO IV.,
969,CANTO IV.,"We ceased not going on because he spoke, but all the while were passing"
970,CANTO IV.,"through the wood, the wood I mean of crowded spirits. Nor yet had our"
971,CANTO IV.,"way been long from where I slept, when I saw a fire, that conquered a"
972,CANTO IV.,"hemisphere of darkness. We were still a little distant from it, yet not"
973,CANTO IV.,so far that I could not partially discern that honorable folk possessed
974,CANTO IV.,"that place. “O thou that honorest both science and art, these, who are"
975,CANTO IV.,"they, that have such honor that from the condition of the others it"
976,CANTO IV.,"sets them apart?” And he to me, “The honorable fame of them which"
977,CANTO IV.,resounds above in thy life wins grace in heaven that so advances them.”
978,CANTO IV.,"At this a voice was heard by me, “Honor the loftiest Poet! his shade"
979,CANTO IV.,"returns that was departed.” When the voice had ceased and was quiet, I"
980,CANTO IV.,saw four great shades coming to us: they had a semblance neither sad
981,CANTO IV.,"nor glad. The good Master began to say, “Look at him with that sword in"
982,CANTO IV.,"hand who cometh before the three, even as lord. He is Homer, the"
983,CANTO IV.,"sovereign poet; the next who comes is Horace, the satirist; Ovid is the"
984,CANTO IV.,"third, and the last is Lucan. Since each shares with me the name that"
985,CANTO IV.,"the single voice sounded, they do me honor, and in that do well.”"
986,CANTO IV.,
987,CANTO IV.,Thus I saw assembled the fair school of that Lord of the loftiest song
988,CANTO IV.,which above the others as an eagle flies. After they had discoursed
989,CANTO IV.,"somewhat together, they turned to me with sign of salutation; and my"
990,CANTO IV.,"Master smiled thereat. And far more of honor yet they did me, for they"
991,CANTO IV.,"made me of their band, so that I was the sixth amid so much wit. Thus"
992,CANTO IV.,"we went on as far as the light, speaking things concerning which"
993,CANTO IV.,"silence is becoming, even as was speech there where I was."
994,CANTO IV.,
995,CANTO IV.,"We came to the foot of a noble castle, seven times circled by high"
996,CANTO IV.,"walls, defended round about by a fair streamlet. This we passed as if"
997,CANTO IV.,hard ground; through seven gates I entered with these sages; we came to
998,CANTO IV.,"a meadow of fresh verdure. People were there with eyes slow and grave,"
999,CANTO IV.,"of great authority in their looks; they spake seldom, and with soft"
1000,CANTO IV.,"voices. Thus we drew apart, on one side, into a place open, luminous,"
1001,CANTO IV.,"and high, so that they all could be seen. There opposite upon the green"
1002,CANTO IV.,"enamel were shown to me the great spirits, whom to have seen I inwardly"
1003,CANTO IV.,exalt myself.
1004,CANTO IV.,
1005,CANTO IV.,"I saw Electra with many companions, among whom I knew both Hector and"
1006,CANTO IV.,"Aeneas, Caesar in armor, with his gerfalcon eyes; I saw Camilla and"
1007,CANTO IV.,"Penthesilea on the other side, and I saw the King Latinus, who was"
1008,CANTO IV.,seated with Lavinia his daughter. I saw that Brutus who drove out
1009,CANTO IV.,"Tarquin; Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia; and alone, apart, I saw"
1010,CANTO IV.,"the Saladin. When I raised my brow a little more, I saw the Master of"
1011,CANTO IV.,"those who know, seated amid the philosophic family; all regard him, all"
1012,CANTO IV.,"do him honor. Here I saw both Socrates and Plato, who before the others"
1013,CANTO IV.,"stand nearest to him; Democritus, who ascribes the world to chance;"
1014,CANTO IV.,"Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales, Empedocles, Heraclitus, and Zeno; and"
1015,CANTO IV.,"I saw the good collector of the qualities, Dioscorides, I mean; and I"
1016,CANTO IV.,"saw Orpheus, Tully, and Linus, and moral Seneca, Euclid the geometer,"
1017,CANTO IV.,"and Ptolemy, Hippocrates, Avicenna, Galen, and Averrhoes, who made the"
1018,CANTO IV.,"great comment. I cannot report of all in full, because the long theme"
1019,CANTO IV.,so drives me that many times speech comes short of fact.
1020,CANTO IV.,
1021,CANTO IV.,The company of six is reduced to two. By another way the wise guide
1022,CANTO IV.,"leads me, out from the quiet, into the air that trembles, and I come"
1023,CANTO IV.,into a region where is nothing that can give light.

1033,CANTO V.,
1034,CANTO V.,
1035,CANTO V.,"Thus I descended from the first circle down into the second, which"
1036,CANTO V.,"girdles less space, and so much more woe that it goads to wailing."
1037,CANTO V.,"There abides Minos horribly, and snarls; he examines the sins at the"
1038,CANTO V.,"entrance; he judges, and he sends according as he entwines himself. I"
1039,CANTO V.,"mean, that, when the miscreant spirit comes there before him, it"
1040,CANTO V.,"confesses itself wholly, and that discerner of sins sees what place of"
1041,CANTO V.,Hell is for it; he girdles himself with his tail so many times as the
1042,CANTO V.,degrees he wills it should be sent down. Always before him stand many
1043,CANTO V.,"of them. They go, in turn, each to the judgment; they speak, and hear,"
1044,CANTO V.,and then are whirled below.
1045,CANTO V.,
1046,CANTO V.,"“O thou that comest to the woeful inn,” said Minos to me, when he saw"
1047,CANTO V.,"me, leaving the act of so great an office, “beware how thou enterest,"
1048,CANTO V.,and to whom thou trustest thyself; let not the amplitude of the
1049,CANTO V.,"entrance deceive thee.” And my Leader to him, “Why then dost thou cry"
1050,CANTO V.,out? Hinder not his fated going; thus is it willed there where is power
1051,CANTO V.,to do that which is willed; and ask thou no more.”
1052,CANTO V.,
1053,CANTO V.,Now the woeful notes begin to make themselves heard; now am I come
1054,CANTO V.,where much lamentation smites me. I had come into a place mute of all
1055,CANTO V.,"light, that bellows as the sea does in a tempest, if it be combated by"
1056,CANTO V.,opposing winds. The infernal hurricane that never rests carries along
1057,CANTO V.,the spirits in its rapine; whirling and smiting it molests them. When
1058,CANTO V.,"they arrive before its rushing blast, here are shrieks, and bewailing,"
1059,CANTO V.,and lamenting; here they blaspheme the power divine. I understood that
1060,CANTO V.,to such torment are condemned the carnal sinners who subject reason to
1061,CANTO V.,appetite. And as their wings bear along the starlings in the cold
1062,CANTO V.,"season in a troop large and full, so that blast the evil spirits;"
1063,CANTO V.,"hither, thither, down, up it carries them; no hope ever comforts them,"
1064,CANTO V.,"not of repose, but even of less pain."
1065,CANTO V.,
1066,CANTO V.,"And as the cranes go singing their lays, making in air a long line of"
1067,CANTO V.,"themselves, so saw I come, uttering wails, shades borne along by the"
1068,CANTO V.,"aforesaid strife. Wherefore I said, “Master, who are those folk whom"
1069,CANTO V.,the black air so castigates?” “The first of these of whom thou wishest
1070,CANTO V.,"to have knowledge,” said he to me then, “was empress of many tongues."
1071,CANTO V.,To the vice of luxury was she so abandoned that lust she made licit in
1072,CANTO V.,"her law, to take away the blame she had incurred. She is Semiramis, of"
1073,CANTO V.,whom it is read that she succeeded Ninus and had been his spouse; she
1074,CANTO V.,"held the land which the Soldan rules. That other is she who, for love,"
1075,CANTO V.,"killed herself, and broke faith to the ashes of Sichaeus. Next is"
1076,CANTO V.,"Cleopatra, the luxurious. See Helen, for whom so long a time of ill"
1077,CANTO V.,"revolved; and see the great Achilles, who at the end fought with love."
1078,CANTO V.,"See Paris, Tristan,—” and more than a thousand shades he showed me with"
1079,CANTO V.,"his finger, and named them, whom love had parted from our life."
1080,CANTO V.,
1081,CANTO V.,"After I had heard my Teacher name the dames of eld and the cavaliers,"
1082,CANTO V.,"pity overcame me, and I was well nigh bewildered. I began, “Poet,"
1083,CANTO V.,"willingly would I speak with those two that go together, and seem to be"
1084,CANTO V.,"so light upon the wind.” And he to me, “Thou shalt see when they shall"
1085,CANTO V.,"be nearer to us, and do thou then pray them by that love which leads"
1086,CANTO V.,"them, and they will come.” Soon as the wind sways them toward us I"
1087,CANTO V.,"lifted my voice, “O weary souls, come speak to us, if One forbid it"

1089,CANTO V.,
1090,CANTO V.,"As doves, called by desire, with wings open and steady, fly through the"
1091,CANTO V.,"air to their sweet nest, borne by their will, these issued from the"
1092,CANTO V.,"troop where Dido is, coming to us through the malign air, so strong was"
1093,CANTO V.,the compassionate cry.
1094,CANTO V.,
1095,CANTO V.,"“O living creature, gracious and benign, that goest through the lurid"
1096,CANTO V.,"air visiting us who stained the world blood-red,—if the King of the"
1097,CANTO V.,"universe were a friend we would pray Him for thy peace, since thou hast"
1098,CANTO V.,"pity on our perverse ill. Of what it pleaseth thee to hear, and what to"
1099,CANTO V.,"speak, we will hear and we will speak to you, while the wind, as now,"
1100,CANTO V.,"is hushed for us. The city where I was born sits upon the sea-shore,"
1101,CANTO V.,"where the Po, with its followers, descends to have peace. Love, that on"
1102,CANTO V.,"gentle heart quickly lays hold, seized him for the fair person that was"
1103,CANTO V.,"taken from me, and the mode still hurts me. Love, which absolves no"
1104,CANTO V.,"loved one from loving, seized me for the pleasing of him so strongly"
1105,CANTO V.,"that, as thou seest, it does not even now abandon me. Love brought us"
1106,CANTO V.,to one death. Caina awaits him who quenched our life.” These words were
1107,CANTO V.,borne to us from them.
1108,CANTO V.,
1109,CANTO V.,"Soon as I had heard those injured souls I bowed my face, and held it"
1110,CANTO V.,"down, until the Poet said to me, “What art thou thinking?” When I"
1111,CANTO V.,"replied, I began, “Alas! how many sweet thoughts, how great desire, led"
1112,CANTO V.,"these unto the woeful pass.” Then I turned me again to them, and I"
1113,CANTO V.,"spoke, and began, “Francesca, thy torments make me sad and piteous to"
1114,CANTO V.,"weeping. But tell me, at the time of the sweet sighs by what and how"
1115,CANTO V.,"did love concede to you to know the dubious desires?” And she to me,"
1116,CANTO V.,"“There is no greater woe than in misery to remember the happy time, and"
1117,CANTO V.,that thy Teacher knows. But if to know the first root of our love thou
1118,CANTO V.,"hast so great a longing, I will do like one who weeps and tells."
1119,CANTO V.,
1120,CANTO V.,"“We were reading one day, for delight, of Lancelot, how love"
1121,CANTO V.,constrained him. We were alone and without any suspicion. Many times
1122,CANTO V.,"that reading made us lift our eyes, and took the color from our faces,"
1123,CANTO V.,but only one point was that which overcame us. When we read of the
1124,CANTO V.,"longed-for smile being kissed by such a lover, this one, who never from"
1125,CANTO V.,"me shall be divided, kissed my mouth all trembling. Galahaut was the"
1126,CANTO V.,"book, and he who wrote it. That day we read in it no farther.”[1]"
1127,CANTO V.,
1128,CANTO V.,"[1] In the Romance, it was Galahaut that prevailed on Guinevere to give"
1129,CANTO V.,a kiss to Lancelot.
1130,CANTO V.,
1131,CANTO V.,
1132,CANTO V.,While one spirit said this the other was weeping so that through pity I
1133,CANTO V.,"swooned, as if I had been dying, and fell as a dead body falls."

1142,CANTO VI.,
1143,CANTO VI.,
1144,CANTO VI.,"When the mind returned, which closed itself before the pity of these"
1145,CANTO VI.,"two kinsfolk, that had all confounded me with sadness, new torments and"
1146,CANTO VI.,"new tormented souls I see around me wherever I move, and howsoever I"
1147,CANTO VI.,"turn, and wherever I gaze."
1148,CANTO VI.,
1149,CANTO VI.,"I am in the third circle, that of the rain eternal, accursed, cold, and"
1150,CANTO VI.,"heavy. Its rule and quality are never new. Coarse hail, and foul water"
1151,CANTO VI.,and snow pour down through the tenebrous air; the earth that receives
1152,CANTO VI.,"them stinks. Cerberus, a beast cruel and monstrous, with three throats"
1153,CANTO VI.,barks doglike above the people that are here submerged. He has
1154,CANTO VI.,"vermilion eyes, and a greasy and black beard, and a big belly, and"
1155,CANTO VI.,"hands armed with claws: he tears the spirits, flays them, and rends"
1156,CANTO VI.,them. The rain makes them howl like dogs; of one of their sides they
1157,CANTO VI.,make a screen for the other; the profane wretches often turn
1158,CANTO VI.,themselves.
1159,CANTO VI.,
1160,CANTO VI.,"When Cerberus, the great worm, observed us he opened his mouths, and"
1161,CANTO VI.,showed his fangs to us; not a limb had he that he kept quiet. And my
1162,CANTO VI.,"Leader opened wide his hands, took some earth, and with full fists"
1163,CANTO VI.,"threw it into the ravenous gullets. As the dog that barking craves, and"
1164,CANTO VI.,"becomes quiet when he bites his food, and is intent and fights only to"
1165,CANTO VI.,"devour it, such became those filthy faces of the demon Cerberus, who so"
1166,CANTO VI.,thunders at the souls that they would fain be deaf.
1167,CANTO VI.,
1168,CANTO VI.,"We were passing over the shades whom the heavy rain subdues, and were"
1169,CANTO VI.,setting our feet upon their vain show that seems a body. They all of
1170,CANTO VI.,"them lay upon the ground, except one who raised himself to sit, quickly"
1171,CANTO VI.,as he saw us passing before him. “O thou who art led through this
1172,CANTO VI.,"Hell,” he said to me, “recognize me, if thou canst; thou wast made"
1173,CANTO VI.,"before I was unmade.” And I to him, “The anguish which thou hast"
1174,CANTO VI.,"perchance withdraws thee from my memory, so that it seems not that I"
1175,CANTO VI.,"ever saw thee. But tell me who thou art, that in a place so woeful art"
1176,CANTO VI.,"set, and with such a punishment, that if any other is greater none is"
1177,CANTO VI.,"so displeasing.” And he to me, “Thy city which is so full of envy, that"
1178,CANTO VI.,"already the sack runs over, held me in it, in the serene life. You"
1179,CANTO VI.,"citizens called me Ciacco;[1] for the damnable sin of gluttony, as thou"
1180,CANTO VI.,"seest, I am broken by the rain. And I, wretched soul, am not alone, for"
1181,CANTO VI.,"all these endure like punishment, for like sin,” and more he said not."
1182,CANTO VI.,"I answered him, “Ciacco, thy trouble so weighs upon me, that it invites"
1183,CANTO VI.,"me to weeping; but tell me, if thou canst, to what will come the"
1184,CANTO VI.,citizens of the divided city; if any one in it is just; and tell me the
1185,CANTO VI.,reason why such great discord has assailed it.”
1186,CANTO VI.,
1187,CANTO VI.,"[1] Ciacco, in popular speech, signifies a hog."
1188,CANTO VI.,
1189,CANTO VI.,
1190,CANTO VI.,"And he to me, “After long contention they will come to blood, and the"
1191,CANTO VI.,savage party will chase out the other with great injury. Thereafter
1192,CANTO VI.,"within three suns it behoves this to fall, and the other to surmount"
1193,CANTO VI.,through the force of one who even now is tacking. It will hold high its
1194,CANTO VI.,"front long time, keeping the other under heavy burdens, however it may"
1195,CANTO VI.,"lament and be shamed thereat. Two men are just, but there they are not"
1196,CANTO VI.,"heeded; Pride, Envy, Avarice are the three sparks that have inflamed"
1197,CANTO VI.,their hearts.”[1]
1198,CANTO VI.,
1199,CANTO VI.,Here he set end unto the lamentable sound.
1200,CANTO VI.,
1201,CANTO VI.,[1] This prophecy relates to the dissensions and violence of the
1202,CANTO VI.,parties of the Whites and the Blacks by which Florence was rent. The
1203,CANTO VI.,"“savage party” was that of the Whites, who were mainly Ghibellines. The"
1204,CANTO VI.,"“one who even now is tacking” was the Pope, Boniface VIII., who was"
1205,CANTO VI.,playing fast and loose with both. Who the “two just men” were is
1206,CANTO VI.,unknown.
1207,CANTO VI.,
1208,CANTO VI.,
1209,CANTO VI.,"And I to him, “Still I would that thou teach me, and that of more"
1210,CANTO VI.,speech thou make a gift to me. Farinata and the Tegghiaio who were so
1211,CANTO VI.,"worthy, Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and the Mosca, and the rest who set"
1212,CANTO VI.,"their minds on well-doing, tell me where they are, and cause that I may"
1213,CANTO VI.,"know them, for great desire constrains me to learn if Heaven sweeten"
1214,CANTO VI.,"them, or Hell envenom."
1215,CANTO VI.,
1216,CANTO VI.,"And he, “They are among the blacker souls: a different sin weighs them"
1217,CANTO VI.,"down to the bottom; if thou so far descendest, thou canst see them. But"
1218,CANTO VI.,when thou shalt be in the sweet world I pray thee that thou bring me to
1219,CANTO VI.,"the memory of others. More I say not to thee, and more I answer thee"
1220,CANTO VI.,"not.” His straight eyes he twisted then awry, looked at me a little,"
1221,CANTO VI.,"and then bent his head, and fell with it level with the other blind."
1222,CANTO VI.,
1223,CANTO VI.,"And the Leader said to me, “He wakes no more this side the sound of the"
1224,CANTO VI.,"angelic trump. When the hostile Sovereign shall come, each one will"
1225,CANTO VI.,"find again his dismal tomb, will take again his flesh and his shape,"
1226,CANTO VI.,will hear that which through eternity reechoes.”
1227,CANTO VI.,
1228,CANTO VI.,Thus we passed along with slow steps through the foul mixture of the
1229,CANTO VI.,"shades and of the rain, touching a little on the future life. Wherefore"
1230,CANTO VI.,"I said, “Master, these torments will they increase after the great"
1231,CANTO VI.,"sentence, or will they become less, or will they be just as burning?”"
1232,CANTO VI.,"And he to me, “Return to thy science, which declares that the more"
1233,CANTO VI.,"perfect a thing is the more it feels the good, and so the pain. Though"
1234,CANTO VI.,"this accursed people never can attain to true perfection, it expects"
1235,CANTO VI.,thereafter to be more than now.”
1236,CANTO VI.,
1237,CANTO VI.,"We took a circling course along that road, speaking far more than I"
1238,CANTO VI.,repeat; and came to the point where the descent is. Here we found
1239,CANTO VI.,"Pluto,[1] the great enemy."
1240,CANTO VI.,
1241,CANTO VI.,"[1] Pluto appears here not as Hades, the god of the lower world, but in"
1242,CANTO VI.,his character as the giver of wealth.

1251,CANTO VII.,"Prodigal.—Pluto.—Fortune.—The Styx.—The Fifth Circle, that of the"
1252,CANTO VII.,Wrathful and the Sullen.
1253,CANTO VII.,
1254,CANTO VII.,
1255,CANTO VII.,"“Pape Satan, pape Satan aleppe,”—began Pluto with his clucking voice."
1256,CANTO VII.,"And that gentle Sage, who knew everything, said to comfort me, “Let not"
1257,CANTO VII.,thy fear hurt thee; for whatso power he have shall not take from thee
1258,CANTO VII.,"the descent of this rock.” Then he turned to that swollen lip and said,"
1259,CANTO VII.,"“Be silent, accursed wolf! inwardly consume thyself with thine own"
1260,CANTO VII.,rage: not without cause is this going to the abyss; it is willed on
1261,CANTO VII.,"high, there where Michael did vengeance on the proud adultery.”[1] As"
1262,CANTO VII.,"sails swollen by the wind fall in a heap when the mast snaps, so fell"
1263,CANTO VII.,to earth the cruel beast.
1264,CANTO VII.,
1265,CANTO VII.,"[1] Adultery, in the sense of infidelity to God."
1266,CANTO VII.,
1267,CANTO VII.,
1268,CANTO VII.,"Thus we descended into the fourth hollow, taking more of the woeful"
1269,CANTO VII.,"bank that gathers in the evil of the whole universe. Ah, Justice of"
1270,CANTO VII.,God! Who heapeth up so many new travails and penalties as I saw? And
1271,CANTO VII.,"why doth our sin so waste us? As doth the wave, yonder upon Charybdis,"
1272,CANTO VII.,"which is broken on that which it encounters, so it behoves that here"
1273,CANTO VII.,the people counterdance.
1274,CANTO VII.,
1275,CANTO VII.,"Here saw I people more than elsewhere many, and from one side and the"
1276,CANTO VII.,other with great howls rolling weights by force of chest. They struck
1277,CANTO VII.,"against each other, and then just there each turned, rolling backward,"
1278,CANTO VII.,"crying, “Why keepest thou?” and “Why flingest thou away?” Thus they"
1279,CANTO VII.,"turned through the dark circle on either hand to the opposite point,"
1280,CANTO VII.,"still crying out their opprobrious verse; then each, when he had come"
1281,CANTO VII.,"through his half circle, wheeled round to the other joust."
1282,CANTO VII.,
1283,CANTO VII.,"And I, who had my heart well-nigh pierced through, said, “My Master,"
1284,CANTO VII.,"now declare to me what folk is this, and if all these tonsured ones on"
1285,CANTO VII.,our left were clerks.”
1286,CANTO VII.,
1287,CANTO VII.,"And he to me, “All of these were so asquint in mind in the first life"
1288,CANTO VII.,that they made no spending there with measure. Clearly enough their
1289,CANTO VII.,"voices bay it out, when they come to the two points of the circle where"
1290,CANTO VII.,the contrary sin divides them. These were clerks who have no hairy
1291,CANTO VII.,"covering on their head, and Popes and Cardinals, in whom avarice"
1292,CANTO VII.,practices its excess.”
1293,CANTO VII.,
1294,CANTO VII.,"And I, “Master, among such as these I ought surely to recognize some"
1295,CANTO VII.,who were polluted with these evils.”
1296,CANTO VII.,
1297,CANTO VII.,"And he to me, “Vain thought thou harborest; the undiscerning life that"
1298,CANTO VII.,"made them foul, to all recognition now makes them dim. Forever will"
1299,CANTO VII.,they come to the two buttings; these will rise from the sepulchre with
1300,CANTO VII.,"closed fist, and these with shorn hair. Ill-giving and ill-keeping have"
1301,CANTO VII.,"taken from them the fair world, and set them to this scuffle; such as"
1302,CANTO VII.,"it is, I adorn not words for it. Now canst thou, son, see the brief"
1303,CANTO VII.,"jest of the goods that are committed unto Fortune, for which the human"
1304,CANTO VII.,"race so scramble; for all the gold that is beneath the moon, or that"
1305,CANTO VII.,"ever was, of these weary souls could not make a single one repose.”"
1306,CANTO VII.,
1307,CANTO VII.,"“Master,” said I to him, “now tell me further; this Fortune, on which"
1308,CANTO VII.,"thou touchest for me, what is it, that hath the goods of the world so"
1309,CANTO VII.,in its clutches?”
1310,CANTO VII.,
1311,CANTO VII.,"And he to me, “O creatures foolish, how great is that ignorance that"
1312,CANTO VII.,harms you! I would have thee now take in my judgment of her. He whose
1313,CANTO VII.,"wisdom transcendeth all made the heavens, and gave them their guides,"
1314,CANTO VII.,"so that every part on every part doth shine, equally distributing the"
1315,CANTO VII.,"light. In like wise for the splendors of the world, He ordained a"
1316,CANTO VII.,"general ministress and guide, who should ever and anon transfer the"
1317,CANTO VII.,"vain goods from race to race, and from one blood to another, beyond the"
1318,CANTO VII.,"resistance of human wit. Wherefore one race rules, and the other"
1319,CANTO VII.,"languishes, pursuant to her judgment, which is occult as the snake in"
1320,CANTO VII.,"the grass. Your wisdom hath no withstanding of her: she provides,"
1321,CANTO VII.,"judges and maintains her realm, as theirs the other gods. Her"
1322,CANTO VII.,"permutations have no truce; necessity compels her to be swift, so often"
1323,CANTO VII.,"cometh he who obtains a turn. This is she who is so set upon the cross,"
1324,CANTO VII.,"even by those who ought to give her praise, giving her blame amiss and"
1325,CANTO VII.,ill report. But she is blessed and hears this not. With the other
1326,CANTO VII.,"Primal Creatures glad she turns her sphere, and blessed she rejoices."
1327,CANTO VII.,But now let us descend to greater woe. Already every star sinks that
1328,CANTO VII.,"was rising when I set out, and too long stay is forbidden.”"
1329,CANTO VII.,
1330,CANTO VII.,"We crossed the circle to the other bank, above a fount that boils and"
1331,CANTO VII.,pours down through a cleft that proceeds from it. The water was far
1332,CANTO VII.,"darker than perse;[1] and we, in company with the dusky waves, entered"
1333,CANTO VII.,"down through a strange way. A marsh it makes, that is named Styx, this"
1334,CANTO VII.,"dismal little stream, when it has descended to the foot of the malign"
1335,CANTO VII.,"gray slopes. And I, who stood intent to gaze, saw muddy people in that"
1336,CANTO VII.,"swamp, all naked and with look of hurt. They were smiting each other,"
1337,CANTO VII.,"not only with hands, but with head, and with chest, and with feet,"
1338,CANTO VII.,mangling one another piecemeal with their teeth.
1339,CANTO VII.,
1340,CANTO VII.,[1] Purple-black.
1341,CANTO VII.,
1342,CANTO VII.,
1343,CANTO VII.,"The good Master said, “Son, now thou seest the souls of those whom"
1344,CANTO VII.,anger overcame; and likewise I would have thee believe for certain that
1345,CANTO VII.,"beneath the water are folk who sigh, and make this water bubble at the"
1346,CANTO VII.,"surface, as thine eye tells thee wherever it turns. Fixed in the slime,"
1347,CANTO VII.,"they say, ‘Sullen were we in the sweet air that by the Sun is"
1348,CANTO VII.,"gladdened, bearing within ourselves the sluggish fume; now we are"
1349,CANTO VII.,"sullen in the black mire.’ This hymn they gurgle in their throats, for"
1350,CANTO VII.,they cannot speak with entire words.”[1]
1351,CANTO VII.,
1352,CANTO VII.,"[1] The sin here punished is that known to the Middle Ages as acedia,"
1353,CANTO VII.,"or accidie,—slackness in good works, and spiritual gloom and"
1354,CANTO VII.,despondency. In the Parson’s Tale Chaucer says: “Envie and ire maken
1355,CANTO VII.,"bitternesse in heart, which bitternesse is mother of accidie.”"
1356,CANTO VII.,
1357,CANTO VII.,
1358,CANTO VII.,"Thus we circled a great arc of the foul fen, between the dry bank and"
1359,CANTO VII.,"the slough, with eyes turned on those who guzzle the mire. We came at"
1360,CANTO VII.,length to the foot of a tower.

1370,CANTO VIII.,
1371,CANTO VIII.,
1372,CANTO VIII.,"I say, continuing, that, long before we were at the foot of the high"
1373,CANTO VIII.,"tower, our eyes went upward to its top because of two flamelets that we"
1374,CANTO VIII.,"saw set there, and another giving signal back from so far that hardly"
1375,CANTO VIII.,could the eye reach it. And I turned me to the Sea of all wisdom; I
1376,CANTO VIII.,"said, “This one, what says it? and what answers that other fire? and"
1377,CANTO VIII.,"who are they that make it?” And he to me, “Upon the foul waves already"
1378,CANTO VIII.,"thou mayest discern that which is expected, if the fume of the marsh"
1379,CANTO VIII.,hide it not from thee.”
1380,CANTO VIII.,
1381,CANTO VIII.,Bowstring never sped arrow from itself that ran so swift a course
1382,CANTO VIII.,"through the air, as a very little boat which I saw coming through the"
1383,CANTO VIII.,"water toward us at that instant, under the direction of a single"
1384,CANTO VIII.,"ferryman, who was crying out, “Art thou then come, fell soul?”"
1385,CANTO VIII.,
1386,CANTO VIII.,"“Phlegyas, Phlegyas, this time thou criest out in vain,” said my Lord;"
1387,CANTO VIII.,“longer thou shalt not have us than only while crossing the slough.” As
1388,CANTO VIII.,"one who listens to some great deceit that has been practiced on him,"
1389,CANTO VIII.,"and then chafes at it, such became Phlegyas in his stifled anger."
1390,CANTO VIII.,
1391,CANTO VIII.,"My Leader descended into the bark and then he made me enter after him,"
1392,CANTO VIII.,and only when I was in did it seem laden. Soon as my Leader and I were
1393,CANTO VIII.,"in the boat, the antique prow goes its way, cutting more of the water"
1394,CANTO VIII.,than it is wont with others.
1395,CANTO VIII.,
1396,CANTO VIII.,"While we were running through the dead channel, before me showed"
1397,CANTO VIII.,"himself one full of mud, and said, “Who art thou that comest before the"
1398,CANTO VIII.,"hour?” And I to him, “If I come I stay not; but thou, who art thou that"
1399,CANTO VIII.,"art become so foul?” He answered, “Thou seest that I am one who weeps.”"
1400,CANTO VIII.,"And I to him, “With weeping and with wailing, accursed spirit, do thou"
1401,CANTO VIII.,"remain, for I know thee although thou art all filthy.” Then he"
1402,CANTO VIII.,"stretched to the boat both his hands, whereat the wary Master thrust"
1403,CANTO VIII.,"him back, saying, “Begone there, with the other dogs!” Then with his"
1404,CANTO VIII.,"arms he clasped my neck, kissed my face, and said, “Disdainful soul,"
1405,CANTO VIII.,blessed be she who bore thee! This one was an arrogant person in the
1406,CANTO VIII.,world; no goodness is there that adorns his memory; therefore is his
1407,CANTO VIII.,shade so furious here. How many now up there are held great kings who
1408,CANTO VIII.,"shall stand here like swine in mire, leaving of themselves horrible"
1409,CANTO VIII.,"dispraises.” And I, “Master, I should much like to see him ducked in"
1410,CANTO VIII.,"this broth before we depart from the lake.” And he to me, “Ere the"
1411,CANTO VIII.,shore allows thee to see it thou shalt be satisfied; it will be fitting
1412,CANTO VIII.,that thou enjoy such a desire.” After this a little I saw such rending
1413,CANTO VIII.,"of him by the muddy folk that I still praise God therefor, and thank"
1414,CANTO VIII.,"Him for it. All cried, “At Filippo Argenti!” and the raging florentine"
1415,CANTO VIII.,spirit turned upon himself with his teeth. Here we left him; so that I
1416,CANTO VIII.,tell no more of him.
1417,CANTO VIII.,
1418,CANTO VIII.,"But on my ears there smote a wailing, whereat forward intent I open"
1419,CANTO VIII.,"wide my eye. And the good Master said, “Now, son, the city draws near"
1420,CANTO VIII.,"that is named Dis, with its heavy citizens, with its great throng.” And"
1421,CANTO VIII.,"I, “Master, already in the valley therewithin I clearly discern its"
1422,CANTO VIII.,"mosques vermillion, as if issuing from fire.” And he said to me, “The"
1423,CANTO VIII.,eternal fire that blazes within them displays them red as thou seest in
1424,CANTO VIII.,this nether Hell.”
1425,CANTO VIII.,
1426,CANTO VIII.,We at last arrived within the deep ditches that encompass that
1427,CANTO VIII.,disconsolate city. The walls seemed to me to be of iron. Not without
1428,CANTO VIII.,first making a great circuit did we come to a place where the ferryman
1429,CANTO VIII.,"loudly shouted to us, “Out with you, here is the entrance.”"
1430,CANTO VIII.,
1431,CANTO VIII.,Upon the gates I saw more than a thousand of those rained down from
1432,CANTO VIII.,"heaven who angrily were saying, “Who is this, that without death goes"
1433,CANTO VIII.,through the realm of the dead folk?” And my wise Master made a sign of
1434,CANTO VIII.,wishing to speak secretly with them. Then they shut in a little their
1435,CANTO VIII.,"great scorn, and said, “Come thou alone, and let him be gone who so"
1436,CANTO VIII.,boldly entered on this realm. Alone let him return on the mad path: let
1437,CANTO VIII.,"him try if he can; for thou, who hast escorted him through so dark a"
1438,CANTO VIII.,"region, shalt remain here.”"
1439,CANTO VIII.,
1440,CANTO VIII.,"Think, Reader, if I was discomforted at the sound of the accursed"
1441,CANTO VIII.,"words, for I did not believe ever to return hither.[1]"

1444,CANTO VIII.,
1445,CANTO VIII.,
1446,CANTO VIII.,"“O my dear Leader, who more than seven times hast renewed assurance in"
1447,CANTO VIII.,"me, and drawn me from deep peril that stood confronting me, leave me"
1448,CANTO VIII.,"not,” said I, “thus undone; and, if the going farther onward be denied"
1449,CANTO VIII.,"us, let us together retrace our footprints quickly.” And that Lord who"
1450,CANTO VIII.,"had led me thither said to me, “Fear not, for no one can take from us"
1451,CANTO VIII.,"our onward way, by Such an one it is given to us. But here await me,"
1452,CANTO VIII.,"and comfort thy dejected spirit and feed on good hope, for I will not"
1453,CANTO VIII.,leave thee in the nether world.”
1454,CANTO VIII.,
1455,CANTO VIII.,"So the sweet Father goes away, and here abandons me, and I remain in"
1456,CANTO VIII.,suspense; and yes and no contend within my head. I could not hear what
1457,CANTO VIII.,"he set forth to them, but he had not staid there long with them, when"
1458,CANTO VIII.,each ran vying back within. These our adversaries closed the gates on
1459,CANTO VIII.,"the breast of my Lord, who remained without, and returned to me with"
1460,CANTO VIII.,"slow steps. He held his eyes upon the ground, and his brow was shorn of"
1461,CANTO VIII.,"all hardihood, and he said in sighs, “Who hath denied to me the houses"
1462,CANTO VIII.,"of woe?” And he said to me, “Thou, because I am wroth, be not dismayed,"
1463,CANTO VIII.,"for I shall win the strife, whoever circle round within for the"
1464,CANTO VIII.,"defence. This their insolence is not new, for of old they used it at a"
1465,CANTO VIII.,"less secret gate, which still is found without a bolt. Above it thou"
1466,CANTO VIII.,didst see the dead inscription; and already on this side of it descends
1467,CANTO VIII.,"the steep, passing without escort through the circles, One such that by"
1468,CANTO VIII.,him the city shall be opened to us.”

1501,CANTO IX.,“Into this depth of the dismal shell does any one ever descend from the

1503,CANTO IX.,"put, and he answered me, “Seldom it happens that any one of us maketh"
1504,CANTO IX.,the journey on which I am going. It is true that another time I was
1505,CANTO IX.,conjured down here by that cruel Erichtho who was wont to call back
1506,CANTO IX.,"shades into their bodies. Short while had my flesh been bare of me,"
1507,CANTO IX.,when she made me enter within that wall in order to drag out for her a
1508,CANTO IX.,"spirit from the circle of Judas. That is the lowest place, and the"
1509,CANTO IX.,"darkest, and the farthest from the Heaven that encircles all. Well do I"
1510,CANTO IX.,know the road: therefore assure thyself. This marsh which breathes out
1511,CANTO IX.,the great stench girds round about the woeful city wherein now we

1520,CANTO IX.,"instant were uprisen suddenly three infernal furies, stained with"
1521,CANTO IX.,"blood, who had the limbs of women and their action, and were girt with"
1522,CANTO IX.,"greenest hydras. Little serpents and cerastes they had for hair,"
1523,CANTO IX.,wherewith their savage brows were bound.
1524,CANTO IX.,
1525,CANTO IX.,"And he, who well knew the handmaids of the queen of the eternal"
1526,CANTO IX.,"lamentation, said to me, “Behold the fell Erinnyes; this is Megaera on"
1527,CANTO IX.,"the left side, she who weeps on the right is Alecto, Tisiphone is in"
1528,CANTO IX.,"the middle,” and therewith he was silent."
1529,CANTO IX.,
1530,CANTO IX.,"With her nails each was tearing her breast, they beat themselves with"
1531,CANTO IX.,"their hands, and cried out so loud that I pressed close to the Poet"

1544,CANTO IX.,And already was coming across the turbid waves a tumult of a sound full
1545,CANTO IX.,of terror at which both the shores trembled. Not otherwise it was than
1546,CANTO IX.,"of a wind, impetuous through the opposing heats, that strikes the"
1547,CANTO IX.,"forest, and without any stay shatters the branches, beats down and"
1548,CANTO IX.,"carries them away; forward, laden with dust, it goes superb, and makes"
1549,CANTO IX.,the wild beasts and the shepherds fly.
1550,CANTO IX.,

1553,CANTO IX.,
1554,CANTO IX.,"As frogs before the hostile snake all scatter through the water, till"
1555,CANTO IX.,"each huddles on the ground, I saw more than a thousand destroyed souls"
1556,CANTO IX.,"flying thus before one, who at the ford was passing over the Styx with"
1557,CANTO IX.,"dry feet. From his face he removed that thick air, waving his left hand"
1558,CANTO IX.,"oft before him, and only with that trouble seemed he weary. Well I"
1559,CANTO IX.,"perceived that he was sent from Heaven, and I turned me to the Master,"
1560,CANTO IX.,"and he made sign that I should stand quiet and bow down unto him. Ah,"
1561,CANTO IX.,how full of disdain he seemed to me! He reached the gate and with a
1562,CANTO IX.,"little rod he opened it, for there was no withstanding."
1563,CANTO IX.,
1564,CANTO IX.,"“O outcasts from Heaven, folk despised,” began he upon the horrible"
1565,CANTO IX.,"threshold, “wherefore is this overweening harbored in you? Why do ye"
1566,CANTO IX.,"kick against that will from which its end can never be cut short, and"
1567,CANTO IX.,which many a time hath increased your grief? What avails it to butt
1568,CANTO IX.,"against the fates? Your Cerberus, if ye remember well, still bears his"
1569,CANTO IX.,chin and his throat peeled for that.” Then he turned back upon the
1570,CANTO IX.,"filthy road and said no word to us, but wore the semblance of a man"
1571,CANTO IX.,"whom other care constrains and stings, than that of him who is before"
1572,CANTO IX.,him.
1573,CANTO IX.,
1574,CANTO IX.,"And we moved our feet toward the city, confident after his holy words."
1575,CANTO IX.,"Within we entered without any strife, and I, who had desire to observe"
1576,CANTO IX.,"the condition which such a stronghold locks in, when I was within, sent"
1577,CANTO IX.,my eyes round about; and I see on every hand a great plain full of woe
1578,CANTO IX.,and of cruel torment.
1579,CANTO IX.,
1580,CANTO IX.,"As at Arles, where the Rhone stagnates, as at Pola, near the Quarnaro"

1582,CANTO IX.,"place uneven; so did they here on every side, saving that the manner"
1583,CANTO IX.,"was more bitter here; for among the tombs flames were scattered, by"
1584,CANTO IX.,which they were so intensely kindled that no art requires iron more so.
1585,CANTO IX.,All their lids were lifted; and such dire laments were issuing forth
1586,CANTO IX.,from them as truly seemed of wretches and of sufferers.
1587,CANTO IX.,
1588,CANTO IX.,"And I, “Master, who are these folk that, buried within those coffers,"
1589,CANTO IX.,"make themselves heard with their woeful sighs?” And he to me, “Here are"
1590,CANTO IX.,"the heresiarchs with their followers of every sect, and the tombs are"
1591,CANTO IX.,"much more laden than thou thinkest. Like with like is buried here, and"
1592,CANTO IX.,the monuments are more and less hot.”

1609,CANTO X.,
1610,CANTO X.,"“O Virtue supreme,” I began, “that through the impious circles turnest"
1611,CANTO X.,"me, according to thy pleasure, speak to me and satisfy my desires. The"
1612,CANTO X.,"folk that are lying in the sepulchres, can they be seen? All the lids"
1613,CANTO X.,"are now lifted, and no one keepeth guard.” And he to me, “All shall be"
1614,CANTO X.,locked in when from Jehoshaphat they shall here return with the bodies
1615,CANTO X.,which they have left on earth. Upon this side Epicurus with all his
1616,CANTO X.,"followers, who make the soul mortal with the body, have their burial"
1617,CANTO X.,"place. Therefore as to the demand that thou makest of me, thou shalt"
1618,CANTO X.,soon be satisfied here within; and also as to the desire concerning
1619,CANTO X.,"which thou art silent to me.” And I, “Good Leader, I hold not my heart"
1620,CANTO X.,hidden from thee except in order to speak little; and not only now to
1621,CANTO X.,that hast thou disposed me.”
1622,CANTO X.,
1623,CANTO X.,"“O Tuscan, who through the city of fire alive art going, speaking thus"
1624,CANTO X.,"modestly, may it please thee to stop in this place. Thy speech makes"
1625,CANTO X.,manifest that thou art native of that noble fatherland to which
1626,CANTO X.,perchance I was too molestful.” Suddenly this sound issued from one of
1627,CANTO X.,"the coffers, wherefore I drew, in fear, a little nearer to my Leader."
1628,CANTO X.,"And he said to me, “Turn, what dost thou? Behold Farinata who hath"
1629,CANTO X.,uprisen; thou shalt see him all from the girdle up.”
1630,CANTO X.,
1631,CANTO X.,"I had already fixed my face on his, and he straightened himself up with"
1632,CANTO X.,breast and front as though he had Hell in great scorn. And the bold and
1633,CANTO X.,"ready hands of my Leader pushed me among the sepulchres to him, saying,"
1634,CANTO X.,“Let thy words be choice.”
1635,CANTO X.,
1636,CANTO X.,"When I was at the foot of his tomb, he looked at me a little, and then,"
1637,CANTO X.,"as though disdainful, asked me, “Who were thy ancestors?” I, who was"
1638,CANTO X.,"desirous to obey, concealed them not, but disclosed them all to him;"
1639,CANTO X.,"whereon he raised his brows a little up, then said, “Fiercely were they"
1640,CANTO X.,"adverse to me, and to my fathers, and to my party, so that twice I"
1641,CANTO X.,"scattered them.” [1] “If they were driven out, they returned from every"
1642,CANTO X.,"side,” replied I to him, “both one and the other time, but yours have"
1643,CANTO X.,not learned well that art.”
1644,CANTO X.,
1645,CANTO X.,[1] Dante’s ancestors were Guelphs.
1646,CANTO X.,
1647,CANTO X.,
1648,CANTO X.,"Then there arose, to view uncovered down to the chin, a shade at the"
1649,CANTO X.,side of this one; I think that it had risen on its knees. Round about
1650,CANTO X.,"me it looked, as if it had desire to see if another were with me, but"
1651,CANTO X.,"when its expectancy was quite extinct, weeping it said, “If through"
1652,CANTO X.,"this blind dungeon thou goest through loftiness of genius, my son,"
1653,CANTO X.,"where is he? and why is he not with thee?” And I to him, “Of myself I"
1654,CANTO X.,"come not; he who waits yonder leads me through here, whom perchance"
1655,CANTO X.,your Guido held in scorn.”[1]
1656,CANTO X.,
1657,CANTO X.,[1] Guido Cavalcanti was charged with the same sin of unbelief as his
1658,CANTO X.,"father. Dante regards this as a sin specially contrary to right reason,"
1659,CANTO X.,typified by Virgil.
1660,CANTO X.,
1661,CANTO X.,
1662,CANTO X.,His words and the mode of the punishment had already read to me the
1663,CANTO X.,"name of this one, wherefore my answer was so full."
1664,CANTO X.,
1665,CANTO X.,"Suddenly straightening up, he cried, “How didst thou say, ‘he held’?"
1666,CANTO X.,lives he not still? doth not the sweet light strike his eyes?” When he
1667,CANTO X.,"took note of some delay that I made before answering, he fell again"
1668,CANTO X.,"supine, and forth appeared no more."
1669,CANTO X.,
1670,CANTO X.,"But that other magnanimous one, at whose instance I had stayed, changed"
1671,CANTO X.,"not aspect, nor moved his neck, nor bent his side. “And if,” he said,"
1672,CANTO X.,"continuing his first words, “they have ill learned that art, it"
1673,CANTO X.,torments me more than this bed. But the face of the lady who ruleth
1674,CANTO X.,here will not be rekindled fifty times ere thou shalt know how much
1675,CANTO X.,"that art weighs. And, so mayest thou return unto the sweet world, tell"
1676,CANTO X.,me wherefore is that people so pitiless against my race in its every
1677,CANTO X.,"law?” Then I to him, “The rout and the great carnage that colored the"
1678,CANTO X.,"Arbia red cause such orison to be made in our temple.” After he had,"
1679,CANTO X.,"sighing, shaken his head, “In that I was not alone,” he said, “nor"
1680,CANTO X.,surely without cause would I have moved with the rest; but I was
1681,CANTO X.,"alone,—there[1] where it was agreed by every one to lay Florence"
1682,CANTO X.,"waste,—he who defended her with open face.” “Ah! so hereafter may your"
1683,CANTO X.,"seed repose,” I prayed to him, “loose for me that knot, which here has"
1684,CANTO X.,"entangled my judgment. It seems, if I rightly hear, that ye foresee"
1685,CANTO X.,"that which time is bringing with him, and as to the present have"
1686,CANTO X.,"another way.” “We see,” he said, “like those who have feeble light, the"
1687,CANTO X.,"things that are far from us, so much still shineth on us the supreme"
1688,CANTO X.,"Leader; when they draw near, or are, our intelligence is all vain, and,"
1689,CANTO X.,"if some one report not to us, we know nothing of your human state."
1690,CANTO X.,Therefore thou canst comprehend that our knowledge will be utterly dead
1691,CANTO X.,"from that moment when the gate of the future shall he closed.” Then, as"
1692,CANTO X.,"compunctious for my fault I said, “Now wilt thou therefore tell that"
1693,CANTO X.,"fallen one that his son is still conjoined with the living, and if just"
1694,CANTO X.,"now I was dumb to answer, make him know that I was so because I was"

1714,CANTO X.,"Thereon he hid himself; and I toward the ancient Poet turned my steps,"
1715,CANTO X.,"reflecting on that speech which seemed hostile to me. He moved on, and"
1716,CANTO X.,"then, thus going, he said to me, “Why art thou so distraught?” And I"
1717,CANTO X.,satisfied his demand. “Let thy memory preserve that which thou hast
1718,CANTO X.,"heard against thyself,” commanded me that Sage, “and now attend to"
1719,CANTO X.,"this,” and he raised his finger. “When thou shalt be in presence of the"
1720,CANTO X.,"sweet radiance of her whose beautiful eye sees everything, from her"
1721,CANTO X.,thou shalt learn the journey of thy life.” Then to the left he turned

1861,CANTO XII.,"As is that ruin which, on this side of Trent, struck the Adige on its"

1864,CANTO XII.,"down that it might give a path to one who was above,—so was the descent"
1865,CANTO XII.,of that ravine. And on the edge of the broken chasm lay stretched out
1866,CANTO XII.,"the infamy of Crete, that was conceived in the false cow. And when he"
1867,CANTO XII.,saw us he bit himself even as one whom wrath rends inwardly. My Sage
1868,CANTO XII.,"cried out toward him, “Perchance thou believest that here is the Duke"
1869,CANTO XII.,"of Athens who up in the world brought death to thee? Get thee gone,"
1870,CANTO XII.,"beast, for this one comes not instructed by thy sister, but he goes to"

1884,CANTO XII.,Now would I have thee know that the other time when I descended hither
1885,CANTO XII.,"into the nether hell, this cliff had not yet fallen. But in truth, if I"
1886,CANTO XII.,"discern clearly, a little ere He came, who levied the great spoil on"
1887,CANTO XII.,"Dis from the supernal circle, in all its parts the deep foul valley"
1888,CANTO XII.,"trembled so that I thought the universe had felt the love by which, as"
1889,CANTO XII.,"some believe, oft times the world has been converted into chaos:[1]"
1890,CANTO XII.,"and, at that moment, this ancient cliff here and elsewhere made this"
1891,CANTO XII.,"downfall. But fix thine eyes below, for the river of blood is near, in"
1892,CANTO XII.,which boils whoso doth harm to others by violence.”
1893,CANTO XII.,
1894,CANTO XII.,"[1] Empedocles taught, as Dante may have learned from Aristotle, that"
1895,CANTO XII.,Love and Hate were the forces by which the elements of which the world
1896,CANTO XII.,is composed were united and dissociated. The effort of Love was to draw
1897,CANTO XII.,"all things into a simple perfect sphere, by which the common order of"
1898,CANTO XII.,the world would be brought to chaos.

1903,CANTO XII.,
1904,CANTO XII.,"I saw a broad ditch, bent in an arc, like one that embraces all the"
1905,CANTO XII.,plain; according as my Guide had said. And between the foot of the bank
1906,CANTO XII.,"and it, in a file were running Centaurs armed with arrows, as they were"
1907,CANTO XII.,"wont in the world to go to the chase. Seeing us descending, all"
1908,CANTO XII.,"stopped, and from the troop three detached themselves, with bows and"
1909,CANTO XII.,"arrows first selected. And one shouted from afar, “To what torment are"
1910,CANTO XII.,"ye coming, ye who descend the slope? Tell it from there; if not, I draw"
1911,CANTO XII.,"the bow.” My Master said, “We will make answer unto Chiron near you"
1912,CANTO XII.,there: ill was it that thy will was ever thus hasty.”
1913,CANTO XII.,
1914,CANTO XII.,"Then he touched me, and said, “That is Nessus, who died for the"
1915,CANTO XII.,"beautiful Dejanira, and he himself wrought vengeance for himself; and"
1916,CANTO XII.,"that one in the middle, who is gazing on his breast, is the great"
1917,CANTO XII.,"Chiron who nurtured Achilles. That other is Pholus, who was so full of"
1918,CANTO XII.,wrath. Round about the ditch they go by thousands shooting with their
1919,CANTO XII.,arrows what soul lifts itself from the blood more than its guilt has
1920,CANTO XII.,allotted it.”
1921,CANTO XII.,
1922,CANTO XII.,"We drew near to those fleet wild beasts. Chiron took a shaft, and with"
1923,CANTO XII.,the notch put his beard backward upon his jaw. When he had uncovered
1924,CANTO XII.,"his great mouth he said to his companions, “Are ye aware that the one"
1925,CANTO XII.,behind moves what he touches? so are not wont to do the feet of the
1926,CANTO XII.,"dead.” And my good Leader, who was now at his breast, where the two"
1927,CANTO XII.,"natures are conjoined, replied, “Truly he is alive, and thus all alone"
1928,CANTO XII.,it behoves me to show him the dark valley: necessity brings him hither
1929,CANTO XII.,and not delight. One withdrew from singing alleluiah who committed unto
1930,CANTO XII.,"me this new office; he is no robber, nor I a thievish spirit. But, by"
1931,CANTO XII.,"that power through which I move my steps along so savage a road, give"
1932,CANTO XII.,"to us one of thine, to whom we may be close, that he may show us where"
1933,CANTO XII.,"the ford is, and may carry this one on his back, for he is not a spirit"
1934,CANTO XII.,who can go through the air.”
1935,CANTO XII.,
1936,CANTO XII.,"Chiron turned upon his right breast, and said to Nessus, “Turn, and"
1937,CANTO XII.,"guide them thus, and if another troop encounter you, make it give way.”"
1938,CANTO XII.,
1939,CANTO XII.,We moved on with the trusty escort along the edge of the crimson
1940,CANTO XII.,"boiling, in which the boiled were making loud shrieks. I saw folk under"
1941,CANTO XII.,"it up to the brow, and the great Centaur said, “These are tyrants who"
1942,CANTO XII.,gave themselves to blood and pillage. Here they weep their pitiless
1943,CANTO XII.,"offenses: here is Alexander, and cruel Dionysius who caused Sicily to"
1944,CANTO XII.,have woeful years. And that front which hath such black hair is
1945,CANTO XII.,"Azzolino, and that other who is blond is Opizzo of Esti, who in truth"
1946,CANTO XII.,was slain by his stepson up there in the world.”
1947,CANTO XII.,
1948,CANTO XII.,"Then I turned me to the Poet, and he said, “Let him now be first, and I"
1949,CANTO XII.,second.” A little further on the Centaur stopped above some folk who
1950,CANTO XII.,far as the throat were seen to issue from that boiling stream. He
1951,CANTO XII.,"showed to us at one side a solitary shade, and said, “He cleft, in the"
1952,CANTO XII.,"bosom of God, the heart that still is honored on the Thames.”[6] Then I"
1953,CANTO XII.,"saw folk, who out of the stream held their head, and even all their"
1954,CANTO XII.,chest; and of these I recognized many. Thus ever more and more shallow
1955,CANTO XII.,"became that blood, until it cooked only the feet: and here was our"
1956,CANTO XII.,passage of the foss.
1957,CANTO XII.,
1958,CANTO XII.,"[1] In 1271, Prince Henry, son of Richard of Cornwall, was stabbed"
1959,CANTO XII.,"during the mass, in a church at Viterbo, by Guy of Montfort, to avenge"
1960,CANTO XII.,"the death of his father, Simon, Earl of Leicester, in 1261. The heart"
1961,CANTO XII.,"of the young Prince was placed in a golden cup, as Villani (vii. 39)"
1962,CANTO XII.,"reports, on a column, at the head of a bridge in London."
1963,CANTO XII.,
1964,CANTO XII.,
1965,CANTO XII.,"“Even as on this side, thou seest that the boiling stream ever"
1966,CANTO XII.,"diminishes,” said the Centaur, “I would have thee believe that on this"
1967,CANTO XII.,"other its bed sinks more and more, until it comes round again where it"
1968,CANTO XII.,behoves that tyranny should groan. The divine justice here pierces that
1969,CANTO XII.,"Attila who was a scourge on earth, and Pyrrhus and Sextus; and forever"
1970,CANTO XII.,milks the tears that with the boiling it unlocks from Rinier of
1971,CANTO XII.,"Corneto, and from Rinier Pazzo, who upon the highways made such"
1972,CANTO XII.,warfare.”

1989,CANTO XIII.,"color, not smooth boughs but knotty and gnarled, not fruits were there"
1990,CANTO XIII.,but thorns with poison. Those savage beasts that hold in hate the
1991,CANTO XIII.,tilled places between Cecina and Corneto have no thickets so rough or
1992,CANTO XIII.,so dense.
1993,CANTO XIII.,
1994,CANTO XIII.,"Here the foul Harpies make their nests, who chased the Trojans from the"
1995,CANTO XIII.,Strophades with dismal announcement of future calamity. They have broad
1996,CANTO XIII.,"wings, and human necks and faces, feet with claws, and a great"
1997,CANTO XIII.,feathered belly. They make lament upon the strange trees.
1998,CANTO XIII.,
1999,CANTO XIII.,"And the good Master, “Before thou enter farther know that thou art in"

2001,CANTO XIII.,"come unto the horrible sand. Therefore look well around, and so thou"

2010,CANTO XIII.,people who because of us had hidden themselves.
2011,CANTO XIII.,
2012,CANTO XIII.,"Therefore said the Master, “If thou break off a twig from one of these"
2013,CANTO XIII.,"plants, the thoughts thou hast will all be cut short.” Then I stretched"
2014,CANTO XIII.,my hand a little forward and plucked a branchlet from a great
2015,CANTO XIII.,"thorn-bush, and its trunk cried out, “Why dost thou rend me?” When it"
2016,CANTO XIII.,"had become dark with blood it began again to cry, “Why dost thou tear"
2017,CANTO XIII.,"me? hast thou not any spirit of pity? Men we were, and now we are"
2018,CANTO XIII.,become stocks; truly thy hand ought to be more pitiful had we been the

2024,CANTO XIII.,"tip fall, and stood like a man who is afraid."
2025,CANTO XIII.,
2026,CANTO XIII.,"“If he had been able to believe before,” replied my Sage, “O wounded"
2027,CANTO XIII.,"soul, what he has seen only in my verse,[1] he would not upon thee have"
2028,CANTO XIII.,stretched his hand. But the incredible thing made me prompt him to an
2029,CANTO XIII.,"act which grieves my very self. But tell him who thou wast, so that, by"
2030,CANTO XIII.,"way of some amends, he may refresh thy fame in the world above, whereto"

2039,CANTO XIII.,"who turned them, locking and unlocking so softly, that from his"
2040,CANTO XIII.,confidence I kept almost every one.[1] Fidelity so great I bore to the
2041,CANTO XIII.,"glorious office, that I lost slumber and strength thereby. The"
2042,CANTO XIII.,"harlot,[2] that never from the abode of Caear turned her strumpet"
2043,CANTO XIII.,"eyes,—the common death and vice of courts,—inflamed all minds against"
2044,CANTO XIII.,"me, and they, inflamed, did so inflame Augustus that my glad honors"
2045,CANTO XIII.,"turned to dismal sorrows. My mind, in scornful temper thinking to"
2046,CANTO XIII.,"escape scorn by death, made me unjust toward my just self. By the"
2047,CANTO XIII.,"strange roots of this tree I swear to you, that I never broke faith"
2048,CANTO XIII.,unto my lord who was so worthy of honor. And if one of you returneth to
2049,CANTO XIII.,"the world, let him comfort my memory that yet lies prostrate from the"
2050,CANTO XIII.,blow that envy gave it.”
2051,CANTO XIII.,
2052,CANTO XIII.,"[1] The spirit who speaks is Pier delle Vigne, the Chancellor of"
2053,CANTO XIII.,"Frederick II.; of low birth, he rose to the first place in the state;"
2054,CANTO XIII.,he was one of the earliest writers of Italian verse. Dante has placed

2066,CANTO XIII.,"Whereon I to him, “Do thou ask him further of what thou thinkest may"
2067,CANTO XIII.,"satisfy me, for I cannot, such pity fills my heart.”"
2068,CANTO XIII.,
2069,CANTO XIII.,"Therefore he began again, “So may this man do for thee freely what thy"
2070,CANTO XIII.,"speech prays, spirit incarcerate, still be pleased to tell us how the"
2071,CANTO XIII.,"soul is bound within these knots, and tell us, if thou canst, if any"
2072,CANTO XIII.,from such limbs is ever loosed.”
2073,CANTO XIII.,
2074,CANTO XIII.,"Then the trunk puffed strongly, and soon that wind was changed into"
2075,CANTO XIII.,this voice: “Briefly shall ye be answered. When the ferocious soul
2076,CANTO XIII.,"departeth from the body wherefrom itself hath torn itself, Minos sends"
2077,CANTO XIII.,"it to the seventh gulf. It falls into the wood, and no part is chosen"
2078,CANTO XIII.,"for it, but where fortune flings it, there it takes root like a grain"
2079,CANTO XIII.,"of spelt; it springs up in a shoot and to a wild plant. The Harpies,"
2080,CANTO XIII.,"feeding then upon its leaves, give pain, and to the pain a window.[1]"
2081,CANTO XIII.,"Like the rest we shall go for our spoils,[2] but not, forsooth, that"
2082,CANTO XIII.,"any one may revest himself with them, for it is not just to have that"
2083,CANTO XIII.,"of which one deprives himself. Hither shall we drag them, and through"
2084,CANTO XIII.,"the melancholy wood shall our bodies be suspended, each on the"
2085,CANTO XIII.,thorn-tree of his molested shade.”
2086,CANTO XIII.,

2091,CANTO XIII.,
2092,CANTO XIII.,
2093,CANTO XIII.,"We were still attentive to the trunk, believing that it might wish to"
2094,CANTO XIII.,"say more to us, when we were surprised by an uproar, as one who"
2095,CANTO XIII.,perceives the wild boar and the chase coming toward his stand and hears
2096,CANTO XIII.,"the Feasts and the branches crashing. And behold two on the left hand,"
2097,CANTO XIII.,"naked and scratched, flying so violently that they broke all the limbs"
2098,CANTO XIII.,"of the wood. The one in front was shouting, “Now, help, help, Death!”"
2099,CANTO XIII.,"and the other, who seemed to himself too slow, “Lano, thy legs were not"
2100,CANTO XIII.,so nimble at the jousts of the Toppo:”[1] and when perhaps his breath
2101,CANTO XIII.,"was failing, of himself and of a bush he made a group. Behind them the"

2103,CANTO XIII.,that have been unleashed. On him that had squatted they set their teeth
2104,CANTO XIII.,"and tore him to pieces, bit by bit, then carried off his woeful limbs."
2105,CANTO XIII.,
2106,CANTO XIII.,[1] Lano was slain in flight at the defeat of the Sienese by the
2107,CANTO XIII.,"Aretines, near the Pieve del Toppo, in 1280. He and Jacomo were"
2108,CANTO XIII.,notorious prodigals.
2109,CANTO XIII.,
2110,CANTO XIII.,
2111,CANTO XIII.,"My Guide then took me by the hand, and led me to the bush, which was"
2112,CANTO XIII.,weeping through its bleeding breaks in vain. “O Jacomo of Sant’
2113,CANTO XIII.,"Andrea,” it was saying, “what hath it vantaged thee to make of me a"
2114,CANTO XIII.,screen? What blame have I for thy wicked life?” When the Master had
2115,CANTO XIII.,"stopped beside it, he said, “Who wast thou, who through so many wounds"
2116,CANTO XIII.,"blowest forth with blood thy woeful speech?” And he to us, “O souls who"
2117,CANTO XIII.,art arrived to see the shameful ravage that hath thus disjoined my
2118,CANTO XIII.,"leaves from me, collect them at the foot of the wretched bush. I was of"
2119,CANTO XIII.,the city which for the Baptist changed her first patron;[1] wherefore
2120,CANTO XIII.,will he always make her sorrowful with his art. And were it not that at
2121,CANTO XIII.,"the passage of the Arno some semblance of him yet remains, those"
2122,CANTO XIII.,citizens who afterwards rebuilt it upon the ashes that were left by
2123,CANTO XIII.,Attila[2] would have labored in vain. I made a gibbet for myself of my
2124,CANTO XIII.,own dwelling.”
2125,CANTO XIII.,
2126,CANTO XIII.,[1] The first patron of florence was Mars; a fragment of a statue of
2127,CANTO XIII.,whom stood till 1333 on the Ponte Vecchio.

2130,CANTO XIII.,"[2] It was not Attila, but Totila, who in 542 besieged Florence, and,"

2146,CANTO XIV.,the scattered leaves and gave them back to him who was already hoarse.
2147,CANTO XIV.,
2148,CANTO XIV.,"Then we came to the confine, where the second round is divided from the"
2149,CANTO XIV.,"third, and where is seen a horrible mode of justice."
2150,CANTO XIV.,
2151,CANTO XIV.,"To make clearly manifest the new things, I say that we had reached a"
2152,CANTO XIV.,plain which from its bed removeth every plant. The woeful wood is a
2153,CANTO XIV.,"garland round about it, even as the dismal foss to that. Here, on the"
2154,CANTO XIV.,"very edge, we stayed our steps. The floor was a dry and dense sand, not"
2155,CANTO XIV.,made in other fashion than that which of old was trodden by the feet of
2156,CANTO XIV.,Cato.
2157,CANTO XIV.,
2158,CANTO XIV.,"O vengeance of God, how much thou oughtest to be feared by every one"
2159,CANTO XIV.,who readeth that which was manifest unto mine eyes!
2160,CANTO XIV.,
2161,CANTO XIV.,"Of naked souls I saw many flocks, that were all weeping very miserably,"
2162,CANTO XIV.,and diverse law seemed imposed upon them. Some folk were lying supine
2163,CANTO XIV.,"on the ground, some were seated all crouched up, and others were going"
2164,CANTO XIV.,"about continually. Those who were going around were far the more, and"
2165,CANTO XIV.,"those the fewer who were lying down under the torment, but they had"
2166,CANTO XIV.,their tongues more loose for wailing.
2167,CANTO XIV.,
2168,CANTO XIV.,"Over all the sand, with a slow falling, were raining down dilated"
2169,CANTO XIV.,"flakes of fire, as of snow on alps without a wind. As the flames which"
2170,CANTO XIV.,"Alexander in those hot parts of India saw falling upon his host, solid"
2171,CANTO XIV.,"to the ground, wherefore he took care to trample the soil by his"
2172,CANTO XIV.,"troops, because the vapor was better extinguished while it was single;"
2173,CANTO XIV.,"so was descending the eternal glow whereby the sand was kindled, like"
2174,CANTO XIV.,"tinder beneath the steel, for doubling of the dole. Without repose was"
2175,CANTO XIV.,"ever the dance of the wretched hands, now there, now here, brushing"
2176,CANTO XIV.,from them the fresh burning.
2177,CANTO XIV.,
2178,CANTO XIV.,"I began, “Master, thou that overcomest everything, except the obdurate"
2179,CANTO XIV.,"demons, who at the entrance of the gate came out against us, who is"
2180,CANTO XIV.,"that great one that seemeth not to heed the fire, and lies scornful and"
2181,CANTO XIV.,"contorted, so that the rain seems not to ripen him?” And that same one"
2182,CANTO XIV.,"who had perceived that I was asking my Leader about him, cried out,"
2183,CANTO XIV.,"“Such as I was alive, such am I dead. Though Jove weary his smith, from"
2184,CANTO XIV.,whom in wrath he took the sharp thunderbolt wherewith on my last day I
2185,CANTO XIV.,"was smitten, or though he weary the others, turn by turn, in Mongibello"
2186,CANTO XIV.,"at the black forge, crying, ‘Good Vulcan, help, help!’ even as he did"
2187,CANTO XIV.,"at the fight of Phlegra, and should hurl on me with all his might,"
2188,CANTO XIV.,thereby he should not have glad vengeance.”
2189,CANTO XIV.,
2190,CANTO XIV.,Then my Leader spoke with force so great that I had not heard him so
2191,CANTO XIV.,"loud, “O Capaneus, in that thy pride is not quenched, art thou the more"
2192,CANTO XIV.,punished; no torture save thine own rage would be a pain adequate to
2193,CANTO XIV.,thy fury.”
2194,CANTO XIV.,
2195,CANTO XIV.,"Then he turned round to me with better look, saying, “He was one of the"
2196,CANTO XIV.,"Seven Kings that besieged Thebes, and he held, and it appears that he"
2197,CANTO XIV.,"holds God in disdain, and little it appears that he prizes Him; but as"
2198,CANTO XIV.,"I said to him, his own despites are very due adornments for his breast."
2199,CANTO XIV.,"Now come on behind me, and take heed withal, not to set thy feet upon"
2200,CANTO XIV.,"the burning sand, but keep them always close unto the wood.”"
2201,CANTO XIV.,
2202,CANTO XIV.,"Silent we came to where spirts forth from the wood a little streamlet,"
2203,CANTO XIV.,the redness of which still makes me shudder. As from the Bulicame
2204,CANTO XIV.,"issues a brooklet, which then the sinful women share among them, so"
2205,CANTO XIV.,this down across the sand went along.[1] Its bed and both its sloping
2206,CANTO XIV.,"banks were made of stone, and the margins on the side, whereby I"
2207,CANTO XIV.,perceived that the crossing[2] was there.
2208,CANTO XIV.,
2209,CANTO XIV.,"[1] The Bulicame, a hot spring near Viterbo, much frequented as a bath,"
2210,CANTO XIV.,the use of a portion of which was assigned to “sinful women.”
2211,CANTO XIV.,
2212,CANTO XIV.,
2213,CANTO XIV.,"[2] The crossing of the breadth of the round of burning sand, on the"
2214,CANTO XIV.,way inward toward the next circle.
2215,CANTO XIV.,
2216,CANTO XIV.,
2217,CANTO XIV.,"“Among all else that I have shown to thee, since we entered through the"
2218,CANTO XIV.,"gate whose threshold is barred to no one, nothing has been discerned by"
2219,CANTO XIV.,thine eyes so notable as is the present stream which deadens all the
2220,CANTO XIV.,"flamelets upon it.” These words were of my Leader, wherefore I prayed"
2221,CANTO XIV.,"him, that he should give me largess of the food for which he had given"
2222,CANTO XIV.,me largess of desire.
2223,CANTO XIV.,
2224,CANTO XIV.,"“In mid sea sits a wasted land,” said he then, “which is named Crete,"
2225,CANTO XIV.,under whose king the world of old was chaste. A mountain is there that
2226,CANTO XIV.,"of old was glad with waters and with leaves, which is called Ida; now"
2227,CANTO XIV.,"it is desert, like a thing outworn. Rhea chose it of old for the trusty"
2228,CANTO XIV.,"cradle of her little son, and to conceal him better when he cried had"
2229,CANTO XIV.,"shoutings made there. Within the mountain stands erect a great old man,"
2230,CANTO XIV.,"who holds his shoulders turned towards Damietta, and looks at Rome as"
2231,CANTO XIV.,"if his mirror. His head is formed of fine gold, and pure silver are his"
2232,CANTO XIV.,arms and breast; then he is of brass far as to the fork. From there
2233,CANTO XIV.,"downward he is all of chosen iron, save that his right foot is of baked"
2234,CANTO XIV.,"clay, and he stands erect on that more than on the other.[1] Every part"
2235,CANTO XIV.,"except the gold is cleft with a fissure that trickles tears, which"
2236,CANTO XIV.,collected perforate that cavern. Their course falls from rock to rock
2237,CANTO XIV.,"into this valley; they form Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon; then it goes"
2238,CANTO XIV.,down through this narrow channel far as where there is no more
2239,CANTO XIV.,"descending. They form Cocytus, and what that pool is, thou shalt see;"
2240,CANTO XIV.,therefore here is it not told.”
2241,CANTO XIV.,
2242,CANTO XIV.,[1] This image is taken directly from the dream of Nebuchadnezzar
2243,CANTO XIV.,(Daniel ii. 31-33). It is the type of the ages of tradition and
2244,CANTO XIV.,"history, with its back to the past, its face toward Rome,—the seat of"
2245,CANTO XIV.,the Empire and of the Church. The tears of the sin and suffering of the
2246,CANTO XIV.,generations of man form the rivers of Hell.
2247,CANTO XIV.,
2248,CANTO XIV.,
2249,CANTO XIV.,"And I to him, “If the present rill floweth down thus from our world,"
2250,CANTO XIV.,why doth it appear to us only at this rim?”
2251,CANTO XIV.,
2252,CANTO XIV.,"And he to me, “Thou knowest that the place is round, and though thou"
2253,CANTO XIV.,"art come far, ever to the left descending toward the bottom, not yet"
2254,CANTO XIV.,hast thou turned through the whole circle; wherefore if a new thing
2255,CANTO XIV.,"appears to us, it ought not to bring wonder to thy face.”"
2256,CANTO XIV.,
2257,CANTO XIV.,"And I again, “Master, where are Phlegethon and Lethe found, for of the"
2258,CANTO XIV.,"one thou art silent, and of the other thou sayest that it is formed by"
2259,CANTO XIV.,this rain?”
2260,CANTO XIV.,
2261,CANTO XIV.,"“In all thy questions surely thou pleasest me,” he answered, “but the"
2262,CANTO XIV.,boiling of the red water ought truly to solve one that thou askest.
2263,CANTO XIV.,"Lethe thou shalt see, but outside of this ditch, there where souls go"
2264,CANTO XIV.,"to lave themselves when sin repented of is taken away.” Then he said,"
2265,CANTO XIV.,“Now it is time to depart from the wood; take heed that thou come
2266,CANTO XIV.,"behind me; the margins afford way, for they are not burning, and above"
2267,CANTO XIV.,them all the vapor is extinguished.”

2279,CANTO XV.,"Now one of the hard margins bears us on, and the fume of the brook"
2280,CANTO XV.,overshadows so that it saves the water and the banks from the fire. As
2281,CANTO XV.,"the Flemings, between Wissant and Bruges, fearing the flood that is"
2282,CANTO XV.,"blown in upon them, make the dyke whereby the sea is routed; and as the"
2283,CANTO XV.,"Paduans along the Brenta, in order to defend their towns and castles,"
2284,CANTO XV.,"ere Chiarentana[1] feel the heat,—in such like were these made, though"

2290,CANTO XV.,
2291,CANTO XV.,We were now so remote from the wood that I could not have seen where it
2292,CANTO XV.,"was though I had turned me round to look, when we encountered a troop"
2293,CANTO XV.,"of souls which was coming along by the bank, and each of them was"
2294,CANTO XV.,"looking at us, as at eve one is wont to look at another under the new"
2295,CANTO XV.,"moon, and they so sharpened their brows toward us as the old tailor"
2296,CANTO XV.,does on the needle’s eye.
2297,CANTO XV.,
2298,CANTO XV.,"Thus gazed at by that company, I was recognized by one who took me by"
2299,CANTO XV.,"the hem, and cried out, “What a marvel!” And when he stretched out his"
2300,CANTO XV.,"arm to me, I fixed my eyes on his baked aspect so that his scorched"
2301,CANTO XV.,visage prevented not my mind from recognizing him; and bending down my
2302,CANTO XV.,"own to his face, I answered, “Are you here, Sir Brunetto?”[1] And he,"
2303,CANTO XV.,"“O my son, let it not displease thee if Brunetto Latini turn a little"
2304,CANTO XV.,"back with thee, and let the train go on.” I said to him, “With all my"
2305,CANTO XV.,"power I pray this of you, and if you will that I seat myself with you I"
2306,CANTO XV.,"will do so, if it pleaseth this one, for I go with him.” “O son,” said"
2307,CANTO XV.,"he, “whoever of this herd stops for an instant lies then a hundred"
2308,CANTO XV.,years without fanning himself when the fire smites him; therefore go
2309,CANTO XV.,"onward, I will come at thy skirts, and then I will rejoin my band which"

2312,CANTO XV.,"[1] Brunetto Latini, one of the most learned and able Florentines of"
2313,CANTO XV.,the thirteenth century. He was banished with the other chiefs of the
2314,CANTO XV.,"Guelph party, after the battle of Montaperti, in 1260, and went to"
2315,CANTO XV.,"France, where he resided for many years. After his return to Florence"
2316,CANTO XV.,"he became Secretary of the Commune, and he was the master of Dante and"
2317,CANTO XV.,"Guido Cavalcanti. His principal literary work was Li Livres dou Tresor,"
2318,CANTO XV.,"written in French, an interesting compend of the omne scibile. He died"
2319,CANTO XV.,"in 1290. Dante uses the plural “you” in addressing him, as a sign of"
2320,CANTO XV.,respect.
2321,CANTO XV.,
2322,CANTO XV.,
2323,CANTO XV.,"I dared not descend from the road to go level with him, but I held my"
2324,CANTO XV.,"head bowed like one who goes reverently. He began, “What fortune, or"
2325,CANTO XV.,"destiny, ere the last day, brings thee down here? and who is this that"
2326,CANTO XV.,shows the road?”
2327,CANTO XV.,
2328,CANTO XV.,"“There above, in the clear life,” I answered him, “I lost myself in a"
2329,CANTO XV.,"valley, before my time was full. Only yester morn I turned my back on"
2330,CANTO XV.,"it; this one[1] appeared to me as I was returning to it, and he is"
2331,CANTO XV.,leading me homeward along this path.”

2333,CANTO XV.,[1] Dante never speaks Virgil’s name in Hell.
2334,CANTO XV.,

2337,CANTO XV.,"glorious port, if, in the beautiful life, I discerned aright. And if I"
2338,CANTO XV.,"had not so untimely died, seeing heaven so benignant unto thee I would"
2339,CANTO XV.,have given cheer unto thy work. But that ungrateful populace malign
2340,CANTO XV.,"which descended from Fiesole of old,[1] and smacks yet of the mountain"
2341,CANTO XV.,"and the rock, will hate thee because of thy good deeds; and this is"
2342,CANTO XV.,"right, for among the bitter sorb trees it is not fitting the sweet fig"
2343,CANTO XV.,should bear fruit. Old report in the world calls them blind; it is a
2344,CANTO XV.,"people avaricious, envious, and proud; from their customs take heed"
2345,CANTO XV.,that thou keep thyself clean. Thy fortune reserves such honor for thee
2346,CANTO XV.,that one party and the other shall hunger for thee; but far from the
2347,CANTO XV.,goat shall be the grass. Let the Fiesolan beasts make litter of
2348,CANTO XV.,"themselves, and touch not the plant, if any spring still upon their"
2349,CANTO XV.,"dungheap, in which may live again the holy seed of those Romans who"
2350,CANTO XV.,remained there when it became the nest of so much malice.”

2352,CANTO XV.,[1] After his flight from Rome Catiline betook himself to Faesulae
2353,CANTO XV.,"(Fiesole), and here for a time held out against the Roman forces. The"
2354,CANTO XV.,"popular tradition ran that, after his defeat, Faesulae was destroyed,"
2355,CANTO XV.,"and its people, together with a colony from Rome, made a settlement on"

2364,CANTO XV.,"and now fills my heart, the dear, good, paternal image of you, when in"
2365,CANTO XV.,the world hour by hour you taught me how man makes himself eternal and
2366,CANTO XV.,"in what gratitude I hold it, so long as I live, it behoves that on my"
2367,CANTO XV.,tongue should be discerned. That which you tell me of my course I
2368,CANTO XV.,"write, and reserve it to be glossed with other text,[1] by a Lady, who"
2369,CANTO XV.,"will know how, if I attain to her. Thus much would I have manifest to"
2370,CANTO XV.,"you: if only that my conscience chide me not, for Fortune, as she will,"

2443,CANTO XVI.,"naked and oiled are wont to do, watching their hold and their vantage,"
2444,CANTO XVI.,"before they come to blows and thrusts, thus, wheeling, each directed"
2445,CANTO XVI.,"his face on me, so that his neck in contrary direction to his feet was"
2446,CANTO XVI.,making continuous journey.
2447,CANTO XVI.,
2448,CANTO XVI.,“Ah! if the misery of this shifting sand bring us and our prayers into
2449,CANTO XVI.,"contempt,” began one, “and our darkened and blistered aspect, let our"
2450,CANTO XVI.,"fame incline thy mind to tell us who thou art, that so securely"
2451,CANTO XVI.,plantest thy living feet in Hell. He whose tracks thou seest me
2452,CANTO XVI.,"trample, though he go naked and singed, was of greater state than thou"
2453,CANTO XVI.,thinkest. Grandson he was of the good Gualdrada; his name was
2454,CANTO XVI.,"Guidoguerra, and in his life he did much with counsel, and with the"
2455,CANTO XVI.,"sword. The other who treads the sand behind me is Tegghiaio Aldobrandi,"
2456,CANTO XVI.,"whose fame should be welcome in the world above. And I, who am set with"
2457,CANTO XVI.,"them on the cross, was Jacopo Rusticucci,[1] and surely my savage wife"
2458,CANTO XVI.,more than aught else injures.
2459,CANTO XVI.,
2460,CANTO XVI.,"[1] Concerning Tegghiaio and Rusticucci Dante had enquired of Ciacco,"
2461,CANTO XVI.,Canto vi. They and Guido Guerra were illustrious citizens of Florence
2462,CANTO XVI.,in the thirteenth century. Their deeds are recorded by Villani and
2463,CANTO XVI.,"Ricordano Malespini. The good Gualdrada, famed for her beauty and her"
2464,CANTO XVI.,"modesty, was the daughter of Messer Bellincione Berti, referred to in"
2465,CANTO XVI.,Cantos w. and wi. of Paradise as one of the early worthies of the city.
2466,CANTO XVI.,"See O. Villani, Cronica. V. xxxvii."

2468,CANTO XVI.,
2469,CANTO XVI.,If I could have been sheltered from the fire I would have cast myself
2470,CANTO XVI.,"below among them, and I think that the Teacher would have permitted it;"
2471,CANTO XVI.,"but because I should have been scorched and baked, fear overcame my"
2472,CANTO XVI.,good will that made me greedy to embrace them. Then I began: “Not
2473,CANTO XVI.,"contempt, but grief, did your condition fix within me, so that slowly"
2474,CANTO XVI.,"will it be all divested, soon as this my Lord said words to me by which"
2475,CANTO XVI.,I understood that such folk as ye are might be coming. Of your city I
2476,CANTO XVI.,am; and always your deeds and honored names have I retraced and heard
2477,CANTO XVI.,with affection. I leave the gall and go for the sweet fruits promised
2478,CANTO XVI.,me by my veracious Leader; but far as the centre needs must I first
2479,CANTO XVI.,descend.”
2480,CANTO XVI.,
2481,CANTO XVI.,"“So may thy soul long direct thy limbs,” replied he then, “and so may"
2482,CANTO XVI.,"thy fame shine after thee, say if courtesy and valor abide in our city"
2483,CANTO XVI.,"as they were wont, or if they have quite gone forth from it? For"
2484,CANTO XVI.,"Guglielmo Borsiere,[1] who is in torment with us but short while, and"
2485,CANTO XVI.,"goes yonder with our companions, afflicts us greatly with his words.”"
2486,CANTO XVI.,
2487,CANTO XVI.,"[1] Nothing is known from contemporary record of Borsiere, but"
2488,CANTO XVI.,"Boccaccio tells a story of him in the Decameron, giorn. i. nov. 8."

2491,CANTO XVI.,“The new people and the sudden gains[1] have generated pride and
2492,CANTO XVI.,"excess, Florence, in thee, so that already thou weepest thereat.” Thus"
2493,CANTO XVI.,"cried I with face uplifted. And the three, who understood that for"
2494,CANTO XVI.,"answer, looked one at the other, as men look at hearing truth."
2495,CANTO XVI.,
2496,CANTO XVI.,[1] Florence had grown rapidly in population and in wealth during the
2497,CANTO XVI.,last years of the thirteenth century.

2500,CANTO XVI.,"“If other times it costeth thee so little,” replied they all, “to"
2501,CANTO XVI.,"satisfy others, happy thou that thus speakest at thy pleasure."
2502,CANTO XVI.,"Therefore, if thou escapest from these dark places, and returnest to"
2503,CANTO XVI.,"see again the beautiful stars, when it shall rejoice thee to say, ‘I"
2504,CANTO XVI.,"have been,’ mind thou speak of us unto the people.” Then they broke the"
2505,CANTO XVI.,"wheel, and in flying their swift legs seemed wings."
2506,CANTO XVI.,
2507,CANTO XVI.,Not an amen could have been said so quickly as they had disappeared;
2508,CANTO XVI.,"wherefore it seemed good to my Master to depart. I followed him, and we"
2509,CANTO XVI.,"had gone little way before the sound of the water was so near to us,"
2510,CANTO XVI.,that had we spoken we scarce had heard. As that river on the left slope
2511,CANTO XVI.,"of the Apennine, which, the first from Monte Veso toward the east, has"
2512,CANTO XVI.,"its proper course,—which is called Acquacheta up above, before it sinks"
2513,CANTO XVI.,"valleyward into its low bed, and at Forli no longer has that name,[1]"
2514,CANTO XVI.,—reverberates from the alp in falling with a single leap there above
2515,CANTO XVI.,"San Benedetto, where there ought to be shelter for a thousand;[2] thus"
2516,CANTO XVI.,down from a precipitous bank we found that dark-tinted water
2517,CANTO XVI.,"resounding, so that in short while it would have hurt the ears."
2518,CANTO XVI.,
2519,CANTO XVI.,[1] At Forli the river is called the Montone; it was the first of the
2520,CANTO XVI.,rivers on the left of the Apennines that had its course to the sea; the
2521,CANTO XVI.,"others before it being tributaries of the Po, which rises on Monte"
2522,CANTO XVI.,Veso.
2523,CANTO XVI.,

2529,CANTO XVI.,"I had a cord girt around me, and with it I had once thought to take the"
2530,CANTO XVI.,"leopard of the dappled skin.[1] After I had loosed it wholly from me,"
2531,CANTO XVI.,"even as my Leader had commanded me, I reached it to him wound up and"
2532,CANTO XVI.,"coiled. Whereon he turned toward the right, and somewhat far from the"
2533,CANTO XVI.,edge threw it down into that deep abyss. “And surely some strange thing
2534,CANTO XVI.,"must needs respond,” said I to myself, “to the strange signal which the"
2535,CANTO XVI.,Master so follows with his eye.”
2536,CANTO XVI.,
2537,CANTO XVI.,"[2] The leopard of the dappled skin, which had often turned back Dante"
2538,CANTO XVI.,from the Mountain to the Dark Wood (see Canto i.); the type of sensual
2539,CANTO XVI.,"sin. The cord is the type of religions asceticism, of which the poet no"
2540,CANTO XVI.,longer has need. The meaning of its use as a signal is not apparent.

2546,CANTO XVI.,soon discover itself unto thy sight.”
2547,CANTO XVI.,
2548,CANTO XVI.,To that truth which has the aspect of falsehood ought one always to
2549,CANTO XVI.,"close his lips so far as he can, because without fault it causes"

2551,CANTO XVI.,"Reader, I swear to thee,—so may they not be void of lasting grace,—that"
2552,CANTO XVI.,I saw through that thick and dark air a shape come swimming upwards
2553,CANTO XVI.,marvelous to every steadfast heart; like as he returns who goes down
2554,CANTO XVI.,sometimes to loose an anchor that grapples either a rock or other thing
2555,CANTO XVI.,"that in the sea is hid, who stretches upward, and draws in his feet."

2572,CANTO XVII.,that he should come to shore near the end of the trodden marbles.[2]
2573,CANTO XVII.,"And that loathsome image of fraud came onward, and landed his head and"
2574,CANTO XVII.,"his body, but drew not his tail upon the bank. His face was the face of"
2575,CANTO XVII.,"a just man (so benignant was its skin outwardly), and of a serpent all"
2576,CANTO XVII.,"the trunk beside; he had two paws, hairy to the armpits; his back and"
2577,CANTO XVII.,breast and both his sides were painted with nooses and circles. With

2593,CANTO XVII.,beasts upon the rim that closes in the sand with stone. In the void all
2594,CANTO XVII.,"his tail was quivering, twisting upwards its venomous fork, which like"
2595,CANTO XVII.,a scorpion’s armed the point.
2596,CANTO XVII.,
2597,CANTO XVII.,"[1] With his tail in the water to catch his prey, as was popularly"

2601,CANTO XVII.,The Leader said: “Now needs must our way bend a little toward that
2602,CANTO XVII.,wicked beast that is couching there.” Therefore we descended on the
2603,CANTO XVII.,right hand and took ten steps upon the verge quite to avoid the sand
2604,CANTO XVII.,"and flame. And when we had come to it, I see, a little farther on,"
2605,CANTO XVII.,people sitting upon the sand near to the void place.[1]
2606,CANTO XVII.,
2607,CANTO XVII.,[1] These people are the third class of sinners punished in this round
2608,CANTO XVII.,"of the Seventh Circle, those who have done violence to Art, the"
2609,CANTO XVII.,usurers. (See Canto xi.)
2610,CANTO XVII.,
2611,CANTO XVII.,
2612,CANTO XVII.,Here the Master said to me: “In order that thou mayst bear away

2616,CANTO XVII.,
2617,CANTO XVII.,"Thus, still up by the extreme head of that seventh circle, all alone, I"
2618,CANTO XVII.,went where the sad people were sitting. Through the eyes their woe was

2621,CANTO XVII.,"Not otherwise do the dogs in summer, now with muzzle, now with paw,"

2624,CANTO XVII.,them I recognized;[2] but I perceived that from the neck of each was
2625,CANTO XVII.,"hanging a pouch, that had a certain color and a certain device,[3] and"
2626,CANTO XVII.,"thereupon it seems their eyes feed. And as I looking come among them, I"
2627,CANTO XVII.,saw upon a yellow purse azure that had the face and bearing of a
2628,CANTO XVII.,"lion.[4] Then as the current of my look proceeded I saw another, red as"
2629,CANTO XVII.,"blood, display a goose whiter than butter. And one, who had his little"
2630,CANTO XVII.,"white bag marked with an azure and pregnant sow,[5] said to me, “What"
2631,CANTO XVII.,"art thou doing in this ditch? Now get thee gone, and since thou art"
2632,CANTO XVII.,"still alive, know that my neighbor, Vitaliano, will sit here at my left"
2633,CANTO XVII.,"side. With these Florentines am I, a Paduan; often they stun my ears"
2634,CANTO XVII.,"shouting, “Let the sovereign cavalier come who will bring the pouch"
2635,CANTO XVII.,"with the three goats.”[1] Then he twisted his mouth, and stuck out his"

2661,CANTO XVII.,"who had already mounted upon the croup of the fierce animal, and he"
2662,CANTO XVII.,"said to me, “Now be strong and courageous; henceforth the descent is by"

2678,CANTO XVII.,"But he who other time had succored me, in other peril, soon as I"

2682,CANTO XVII.,
2683,CANTO XVII.,"As a little vessel goeth from its place, backward, backward, so he"

2686,CANTO XVII.,"eel, and with his paws gathered the air to himself. Greater fear I do"
2687,CANTO XVII.,"not think there was when Phaethon abandoned the reins, whereby heaven,"
2688,CANTO XVII.,"as is still apparent, was scorched; nor when the wretched Icarus felt"
2689,CANTO XVII.,"his flanks unfeathering through the melting of the wax, his father"
2690,CANTO XVII.,"shouting to him, “Ill way thou holdest,” than mine was, when I saw that"

2789,CANTO XVIII.,
2790,CANTO XVIII.,
2791,CANTO XVIII.,I rejoined my Escort; then with few steps we came to where a crag
2792,CANTO XVIII.,"jutted from the bank.[1] Easily enough we ascended it, and turning to"
2793,CANTO XVIII.,"the right[2] upon its ridge, from those eternal circles we departed."
2794,CANTO XVIII.,
2795,CANTO XVIII.,"[1] Forming a bridge, thrown like an arch across the pit."
2796,CANTO XVIII.,
2797,CANTO XVIII.,
2798,CANTO XVIII.,"[2] The course of the Poets, which has mostly been to the left through"
2799,CANTO XVIII.,"the upper Circles, is now generally to proceed straight across the"
2800,CANTO XVIII.,lower Circles where Fraud is punished. They had been going to the left
2801,CANTO XVIII.,"at the foot of the precipice, and consequently turn to the right to"
2802,CANTO XVIII.,ascend the bridge. The allegorical intention in the direction of their
2803,CANTO XVIII.,course is evident.
2804,CANTO XVIII.,
2805,CANTO XVIII.,
2806,CANTO XVIII.,When we were there where it opens below to give passage to the
2807,CANTO XVIII.,"scourged, the Leader said, “Stop, and let the sight strike on thee of"
2808,CANTO XVIII.,"these other miscreants, of whom thou hast not yet seen the face,"
2809,CANTO XVIII.,because they have gone along in the same direction with us.”
2810,CANTO XVIII.,
2811,CANTO XVIII.,From the ancient bridge we looked at the train that was coining toward
2812,CANTO XVIII.,"us from the other side, and which the whip in like manner drives on."
2813,CANTO XVIII.,"The good Master, without my asking, said to me, “Look at that great one"
2814,CANTO XVIII.,"who is coming, and seems not to shed a tear for pain. What royal aspect"
2815,CANTO XVIII.,"he still retains! He is Jason, who by courage and by wit despoiled the"
2816,CANTO XVIII.,"Colchians of their ram. He passed by the isle of Lemnos, after the"
2817,CANTO XVIII.,undaunted women pitiless had given all their males to death. There with
2818,CANTO XVIII.,"tokens and with ornate words he deceived Hypsipyle, the maiden, who"
2819,CANTO XVIII.,"first had deceived all the rest. There he left her pregnant, and alone;"
2820,CANTO XVIII.,such sin condemns him to such torment; and also for Medea is vengeance
2821,CANTO XVIII.,done. With him goes whoso in such wise deceives. And let this suffice
2822,CANTO XVIII.,"to know of the first valley, and of those that it holds in its fangs.”"
2823,CANTO XVIII.,
2824,CANTO XVIII.,"Now we were where the narrow path sets across the second dyke, and"
2825,CANTO XVIII.,makes of it shoulders for another arch. Here we heard people moaning in
2826,CANTO XVIII.,"the next pit, and snorting with their muzzles, and with their palms"
2827,CANTO XVIII.,beating themselves. The banks were encrusted with a mould because of
2828,CANTO XVIII.,"the breath from below that sticks on them, and was making quarrel with"
2829,CANTO XVIII.,the eyes and with the nose. The bottom is so hollowed out that no place
2830,CANTO XVIII.,"sufficeth us for seeing it, without mounting on the crest of the arch"
2831,CANTO XVIII.,"where the crag rises highest. Hither we came, and thence, down in the"
2832,CANTO XVIII.,"ditch, I saw people plunged in an excrement that seemed as if it"
2833,CANTO XVIII.,proceeded from human privies.
2834,CANTO XVIII.,
2835,CANTO XVIII.,"And while I am searching down there with my eye, I saw one with his"
2836,CANTO XVIII.,head so foul with ordure that it was not apparent whether he were
2837,CANTO XVIII.,"layman or clerk. He shouted to me, “Why art so greedy to look more at"
2838,CANTO XVIII.,"me than at the other filthy ones?” And I to him, “Because, if I"
2839,CANTO XVIII.,"remember rightly, ere now I have seen thee with dry hair, and thou art"
2840,CANTO XVIII.,Alessio Interminei of Lucca[1]; therefore I eye thee more than all the
2841,CANTO XVIII.,"rest.” And he then, beating his pate, “Down here those flatteries"
2842,CANTO XVIII.,wherewith my tongue was never cloyed have submerged me.”
2843,CANTO XVIII.,
2844,CANTO XVIII.,[1] Of him nothing is known but what these words tell.

2847,CANTO XVIII.,"Hereupon my Leader, “Mind thou push thy sight a little farther forward"
2848,CANTO XVIII.,so that with thine eyes thou mayest quite reach the face of that dirty
2849,CANTO XVIII.,"and disheveled creature, who is scratching herself there with her nasty"
2850,CANTO XVIII.,"nails, and now is crouching down and now standing on foot. She is Thais"
2851,CANTO XVIII.,"the prostitute, who answered her paramour when he said, ‘Have I great"
2852,CANTO XVIII.,"thanks from thee?’—‘Nay, marvelous.’”[1] And herewith let our sight be"

2878,CANTO XIX.,
2879,CANTO XIX.,"I saw along the sides, and over the bottom, the livid stone full of"
2880,CANTO XIX.,"holes all of one size, and each was circular. They seemed to me not"
2881,CANTO XIX.,less wide nor larger than those that in my beautiful Saint John are
2882,CANTO XIX.,"made as place for the baptizers [1] one of which, not many years ago, I"
2883,CANTO XIX.,broke for sake of one who was stifling in it; and be this the seal to
2884,CANTO XIX.,undeceive all men. Forth from the mouth of each protruded the feet of a
2885,CANTO XIX.,"sinner, and his legs up to the calf, and the rest was within. The soles"
2886,CANTO XIX.,"of all were both on fire, wherefore their joints quivered so violently"
2887,CANTO XIX.,that they would have snapped withes and bands. As the flaming of things
2888,CANTO XIX.,"oiled is wont to move only on the outer surface, so was it there from"
2889,CANTO XIX.,the heels to the toes.
2890,CANTO XIX.,
2891,CANTO XIX.,[1] “My beautiful Saint John” is the Baptistery at Florence. In Dante’s
2892,CANTO XIX.,"time the infants, born during the year, were all here baptized by"
2893,CANTO XIX.,"immersion, mostly on the day of St. John Baptist, the 24th of June."
2894,CANTO XIX.,"There was a large circular font in the middle of the church, and around"
2895,CANTO XIX.,it in its marble wall were four cylindrical standing-places for the
2896,CANTO XIX.,"priests, closed by doors, to protect them from the pressure of the"

2918,CANTO XIX.,"“O whoe’er thou art, that keepest upside down, sad soul, planted like a"

2947,CANTO XIX.,"quite twisted his feet. Thereafter, sighing and with tearful voice, he"
2948,CANTO XIX.,"said to me, “Then what dost thou require of me? If to know who I am"
2949,CANTO XIX.,"concerneth thee so much that thou hast crossed the bank therefor, know"
2950,CANTO XIX.,that I was vested with the Great Mantle; and verily I was a son of the
2951,CANTO XIX.,"She-Bear,[1] so eager to advance the cubs, that up there I put wealth,"
2952,CANTO XIX.,"and here myself, into the purse. Beneath my head are stretched the"
2953,CANTO XIX.,"others that preceded me in simony, flattened through the fissures of"
2954,CANTO XIX.,"the rock. There below shall I likewise sink, when he shall come whom I"
2955,CANTO XIX.,"believed thou wert, then when I put to thee the sudden question; but"
2956,CANTO XIX.,"already the time is longer that I have cooked my feet, and that I have"
2957,CANTO XIX.,"been thus upside down, than he will stay planted with red feet; for"
2958,CANTO XIX.,"after him will come, of uglier deed, from westward, a shepherd without"
2959,CANTO XIX.,"law,[2] such as must cover him and me again. A new Jason will he be, of"
2960,CANTO XIX.,whom it is read in Maccabees;[3] and as to that one his king was

2969,CANTO XIX.,shorter time affords an indication that this canto was not written
2970,CANTO XIX.,"until after 1314, the year of his death."

2973,CANTO XIX.,"[3] The story of Jason, “that ungodly wretch and no high-priest” who"

2984,CANTO XIX.,nothing save ‘Follow me.’ Nor did Peter or the others require of

3006,CANTO XIX.,[2] Dante deals freely with the figures of the Apocalypse: Revelation

3069,CANTO XX.,
3070,CANTO XX.,[1] It is impossible to give the full significance of Dante’s words in

3268,CANTO XXI.,"sudden begs where he stops, they came forth from under the little"
3269,CANTO XXI.,"bridge, and turned against him all their forks. But he cried out, “Be"
3270,CANTO XXI.,"no one of you savage; ere your hook take hold of me, let one of you"
3271,CANTO XXI.,"come forward that he may hear me, and then take counsel as to grappling"

3273,CANTO XXI.,"rest stood still; and he came toward him, saying, “What doth this avail"
3274,CANTO XXI.,"him?” “Thinkest thou, Malacoda, to see me come here,” said my Master,"
3275,CANTO XXI.,"“safe hitherto from all your hindrances, except by Will Divine and fate"
3276,CANTO XXI.,"propitious? Let us go on, for in Heaven it is willed that I show"
3277,CANTO XXI.,another this savage road.” Then was his arrogance so fallen that he let

3287,CANTO XXI.,they would not keep their compact. And thus I once saw the
3288,CANTO XXI.,"foot-soldiers afraid, who came out under pledge from Caprona,[1] seeing"
3289,CANTO XXI.,themselves among so many enemies. I drew with my whole body alongside
3290,CANTO XXI.,"my Leader, and turned not mine eyes from their look, which was not"
3291,CANTO XXI.,"good. They lowered their forks, and, “Wilt thou that I touch him on the"
3292,CANTO XXI.,"rump?” said one to the other, and they answered, “Yes, see thou nick it"
3293,CANTO XXI.,for him.” But that demon who was holding speech with my Leader turned

3303,CANTO XXI.,"another crag that affords a way. Yesterday, five hours later than this"

3323,CANTO XXI.,
3324,CANTO XXI.,"Upon the left bank they wheeled round, but first each had pressed his"

3346,CANTO XXII.,
3347,CANTO XXII.,"We went along with the ten demons. Ah, the fell company! but in the"
3348,CANTO XXII.,"church with saints, and in the tavern with gluttons. Ever on the pitch"
3349,CANTO XXII.,"was I intent, to see every aspect of the pit, and of the people that"
3350,CANTO XXII.,were burning in it.

3352,CANTO XXII.,"As dolphins, when, by the arching of their back, they give a sign to"

3354,CANTO XXII.,"then, to alleviate his pain, one of the sinners showed his back and hid"
3355,CANTO XXII.,in less time than it lightens. And as at the edge of the water of a
3356,CANTO XXII.,"ditch the frogs stand with only their muzzle out, so that they conceal"
3357,CANTO XXII.,"their feet and the rest of their bulk, thus stood on every side the"
3358,CANTO XXII.,sinners; but as Barbariccia approached so did they draw back beneath
3359,CANTO XXII.,"the boiling. I saw, and still my heart shudders at it, one waiting,"
3360,CANTO XXII.,just as it happens that one frog stays and another jumps. And
3361,CANTO XXII.,"Graffiacane, who was nearest over against him, hooked him by his pitchy"
3362,CANTO XXII.,"locks, and drew him up so that he seemed to me an otter. I knew now the"
3363,CANTO XXII.,"name of every one of them, so had I noted them when they were chosen,"
3364,CANTO XXII.,"and when they had called each other I had listened how. “O Rubicante,"
3365,CANTO XXII.,"see thou set thy claws upon him so thou flay him,” shouted all the"
3366,CANTO XXII.,accursed ones together.
3367,CANTO XXII.,
3368,CANTO XXII.,"And I, “My Master, see, if thou canst, that thou find out who is the"
3369,CANTO XXII.,luckless one come into the hands of his adversaries.” My Leader drew up
3370,CANTO XXII.,"to his side, asked him whence he was, and he replied, “I was born in"
3371,CANTO XXII.,"the kingdom of Navarre; my mother placed me in service of a lord, for"
3372,CANTO XXII.,"she had borne me to a ribald, destroyer of himself and of his"
3373,CANTO XXII.,substance. Afterward I was of the household of the good King
3374,CANTO XXII.,"Thibault;[1] there I set myself to practice barratry, for which I pay"

3381,CANTO XXII.,
3382,CANTO XXII.,"And Ciriatto, from whose mouth protruded on either side a tusk, as in a"
3383,CANTO XXII.,"boar, made him feel how one of them rips. Among evil cats the mouse had"
3384,CANTO XXII.,"come; but Barbariccia clasped him in his arms, and said, “Stand off,"
3385,CANTO XXII.,"while I enfork him,” and to my Master turned his face. “Ask,” said he,"
3386,CANTO XXII.,"“if thou desirest to know more from him, before some other undo him.”"
3387,CANTO XXII.,"The Leader, “Now, then, tell of the other sinners; knowst thou any one"
3388,CANTO XXII.,"under the pitch who is Italian?” And he, “I parted short while since"
3389,CANTO XXII.,from one who was a neighbor to it; would that with him I still were
3390,CANTO XXII.,"covered so that I might not fear claw or hook.” And Libicocco said, “We"
3391,CANTO XXII.,"have borne too much,” and seized his arm with his grapple so that,"
3392,CANTO XXII.,"tearing, he carried off a sinew of it. Draghignazzo, also, he wished to"
3393,CANTO XXII.,"give him a clutch down at his legs, whereat their decurion turned round"
3394,CANTO XXII.,about with evil look.
3395,CANTO XXII.,
3396,CANTO XXII.,"When they were a little appeased, my Leader, without delay, asked him"
3397,CANTO XXII.,"who still was gazing at his wound, “Who was he from whom thou sayest"
3398,CANTO XXII.,"thou madest in parting to come to shore?” And he replied, “It was"
3399,CANTO XXII.,"Brother Gomita, he of Gallura,[1] vessel of all fraud, who held the"
3400,CANTO XXII.,"enemies of his lord in hand, and dealt so with them that they all"
3401,CANTO XXII.,"praise him for it. Money he took, and let them smoothly off, so he"
3402,CANTO XXII.,"says; and in other offices besides he was no little barrator, but"
3403,CANTO XXII.,"sovereign. With him frequents Don Michael Zanche of Logodoro,[2] and in"
3404,CANTO XXII.,talking of Sardinia their tongues feel not weary. O me! see ye that
3405,CANTO XXII.,"other who is grinning: I would say more, but I fear lest he is making"
3406,CANTO XXII.,"ready to scratch my itch.” And the grand provost, turning to"
3407,CANTO XXII.,"Farfarello, who was rolling his eyes as if to strike, said, “Get thee"

3416,CANTO XXII.,[2] Logodoro was another of the judicatures of Sardinia. Don Michael

3419,CANTO XXII.,
3420,CANTO XXII.,
3421,CANTO XXII.,"“If you wish to see or to hear Tuscans or Lombards,” thereon began"
3422,CANTO XXII.,"again the frightened one, “I will make them come; but let the"
3423,CANTO XXII.,"Malebranche stand a little withdrawn, so that they may not be afraid of"
3424,CANTO XXII.,"their vengeance, and I, sitting in this very place, for one that I am,"
3425,CANTO XXII.,"will make seven of them come, when I shall whistle as is our wont to do"
3426,CANTO XXII.,whenever one of us comes out.” Cagnazzo at this speech raised his
3427,CANTO XXII.,"muzzle, shaking his head, and said, “Hear the knavery he has devised"
3428,CANTO XXII.,for throwing himself under!” Whereon he who had snares in great plenty
3429,CANTO XXII.,"answered, “Too knavish am I, when I procure for mine own companions"
3430,CANTO XXII.,"greater sorrow.” Alichino held not in, and, in opposition to the"
3431,CANTO XXII.,"others, said to him, “If thou dive, I will not come behind thee at a"
3432,CANTO XXII.,"gallop, but I will beat my wings above the pitch; let the ridge be"
3433,CANTO XXII.,"left, and be the bank a shield, to see if thou alone availest more than"
3434,CANTO XXII.,we.”
3435,CANTO XXII.,
3436,CANTO XXII.,O thou that readest! thou shalt hear new sport. Each turned his eyes to
3437,CANTO XXII.,"the other side, he first who had been most averse to doing it. The"
3438,CANTO XXII.,"Navarrese chose well his time, planted his feet firmly on the ground,"
3439,CANTO XXII.,"and in an instant leaped, and from their purpose freed himself. At"
3440,CANTO XXII.,"this, each of them was pricked with shame, but he most who was the"
3441,CANTO XXII.,"cause of the loss; wherefore he started and cried out, “Thou art"
3442,CANTO XXII.,"caught.” But little it availed, for wings could not outstrip fear. The"
3443,CANTO XXII.,"one went under, and the other, flying, turned his breast upward. Not"
3444,CANTO XXII.,"otherwise the wild duck on a sudden dives when the falcon comes close,"
3445,CANTO XXII.,"and he returns up vexed and baffled. Calcabrina, enraged at the flout,"
3446,CANTO XXII.,"kept flying behind him, desirous that the sinner should escape, that he"
3447,CANTO XXII.,might have a scuffle; and when the barrator had disappeared he turned
3448,CANTO XXII.,"his talons upon his companion, and grappled with him above the ditch."
3449,CANTO XXII.,"But the other was indeed a sparrowhawk full grown to gripe him well,"
3450,CANTO XXII.,and both fell into the midst of the boiling pool. The heat was a sudden
3451,CANTO XXII.,"ungrappler, but nevertheless there was no rising from it, they had"
3452,CANTO XXII.,"their wings so glued. Barbariccia, grieving with the rest of his troop,"
3453,CANTO XXII.,"made four of them fly to the other side with all their forks, and very"
3454,CANTO XXII.,"quickly, this side and that, they descended to their post. They"
3455,CANTO XXII.,"stretched out their hooks toward the belimed ones, who were already"

3471,CANTO XXIII.,frog and the mole; for NOW and THIS INSTANT are not more alike than the
3472,CANTO XXIII.,"one is to the other, if beginning and end are rightly coupled by the"
3473,CANTO XXIII.,"attentive mind.[1] And as one thought bursts out from another, so from"
3474,CANTO XXIII.,that then sprang another which made my first fear double. I reflected
3475,CANTO XXIII.,"in this wise: These through us have been flouted, and with such harm"
3476,CANTO XXIII.,and mock as I believe must vex them greatly; if anger to ill-will be
3477,CANTO XXIII.,"added, they will come after us more merciless than the dog upon the"
3478,CANTO XXIII.,leveret which he snaps.
3479,CANTO XXIII.,
3480,CANTO XXIII.,"[1] “Sed dices forsan, lector,” says Benvenuto da Imola, “nescio per me"
3481,CANTO XXIII.,videre quomodo istae duae fictiones habeant inter se tantam
3482,CANTO XXIII.,"convenientam. Ad quod respondeo, quod passus vere est fortis.” The"
3483,CANTO XXIII.,"point seems to be that, the frog having deceitfully brought the mole to"
3484,CANTO XXIII.,"trouble and death, the mole declares, “me vindicabit major,” and the"
3485,CANTO XXIII.,eagle swoops down and devours the frog as well as the dead mole. The
3486,CANTO XXIII.,comparison is not very close except in the matter of anticipated
3487,CANTO XXIII.,vengeance.
3488,CANTO XXIII.,
3489,CANTO XXIII.,
3490,CANTO XXIII.,"Already I was feeling my hair all bristling with fear, and was"
3491,CANTO XXIII.,"backwards intent, when I said, “Master, if thou concealest not thyself"
3492,CANTO XXIII.,"and me speedily, I am afraid of the Malebranche; we have them already"
3493,CANTO XXIII.,"behind us, and I so imagine them that I already feel them.” And he, “If"
3494,CANTO XXIII.,"I were of leaded glass,[1] I should not draw thine outward image more"
3495,CANTO XXIII.,quickly to me than thine inward I receive. Even now came thy thoughts
3496,CANTO XXIII.,"among mine, with similar action and with similar look, so that of both"
3497,CANTO XXIII.,one sole design I made. If it be that the right bank lieth so that we
3498,CANTO XXIII.,"can descend into the next pit, we shall escape the imagined chase.”"
3499,CANTO XXIII.,
3500,CANTO XXIII.,[1] A mirror.
3501,CANTO XXIII.,
3502,CANTO XXIII.,
3503,CANTO XXIII.,"Not yet had he finished reporting this design, when I saw them coming"
3504,CANTO XXIII.,"with spread wings, not very far off, with will to take us. My Leader on"
3505,CANTO XXIII.,"a sudden took me, as a mother who is wakened by the noise, and near her"
3506,CANTO XXIII.,"sees the kindled flames, who takes her son and flies, and, having more"
3507,CANTO XXIII.,"care of him than of herself, stays not so long as only to put on a"
3508,CANTO XXIII.,"shift. And down from the ridge of the hard bank, supine he gave himself"
3509,CANTO XXIII.,to the sloping rock that closes one of the sides of the next pit. Never
3510,CANTO XXIII.,"ran water so swiftly through a duct, to turn the wheel of a land-mill,"
3511,CANTO XXIII.,"when it approaches near est to the paddles, as my Master over that"
3512,CANTO XXIII.,"border, bearing me along upon his breast, as his own son, and not as"
3513,CANTO XXIII.,"his companion. Hardly had his feet reached the bed of the depth below,"
3514,CANTO XXIII.,"when they were on the ridge right over us; but here there was no fear,"
3515,CANTO XXIII.,for the high Providence that willed to set them as ministers of the
3516,CANTO XXIII.,fifth ditch deprived them all of power of departing thence.
3517,CANTO XXIII.,
3518,CANTO XXIII.,There below we found a painted people who were going around with very
3519,CANTO XXIII.,"slow steps, weeping, and in their semblance weary and vanquished. They"
3520,CANTO XXIII.,"had cloaks, with hoods lowered before their eyes, made of the same cut"
3521,CANTO XXIII.,"as those of the monks in Cluny. Outwardly they are gilded, so that it"
3522,CANTO XXIII.,"dazzles, but within all lead, and so heavy that Frederick put them on"
3523,CANTO XXIII.,of straw.[1] Oh mantle wearisome for eternity!
3524,CANTO XXIII.,
3525,CANTO XXIII.,[1] The leaden cloaks which the Emperor Frederick II. caused to be put
3526,CANTO XXIII.,"on criminals, who were then burned to death, were light as straw in"
3527,CANTO XXIII.,comparison with these.
3528,CANTO XXIII.,
3529,CANTO XXIII.,
3530,CANTO XXIII.,"We turned, still ever to the left hand, along with them, intent on"
3531,CANTO XXIII.,their sad plaint. But because of the weight that tired folk came so
3532,CANTO XXIII.,slowly that we had fresh company at every movement of the haunch.
3533,CANTO XXIII.,"Wherefore I to my Leader, “See that thou find some one who may be known"
3534,CANTO XXIII.,"by deed or name, and so in going move thy eyes around.” And one who"
3535,CANTO XXIII.,"understood the Tuscan speech cried out behind us, “Stay your feet, ye"
3536,CANTO XXIII.,who run thus through the dusky air; perchance thou shalt have from me
3537,CANTO XXIII.,"that which thou askest.” Whereon the Leader turned and said, “Await,"
3538,CANTO XXIII.,"and then according to his pace proceed.” I stopped, and saw two show,"
3539,CANTO XXIII.,"by their look, great haste of mind to be with me, but their load"
3540,CANTO XXIII.,"delayed them, and the narrow way."
3541,CANTO XXIII.,
3542,CANTO XXIII.,"When they had come up, somewhile, with eye askance,[1] they gazed at me"
3543,CANTO XXIII.,"without a word; then they turned to each other, and said one to the"
3544,CANTO XXIII.,"other, “This one seems alive by the action of his throat; and if they"
3545,CANTO XXIII.,"are dead, by what privilege do they go uncovered by the heavy stole?”"
3546,CANTO XXIII.,"Then they said to me, “O Tuscan, who to the college of the wretched"
3547,CANTO XXIII.,"hypocrites art come, disdain not to tell who thou art.” And I to them,"
3548,CANTO XXIII.,"“I was born and grew up on the fair river of Arno, at the great town,"
3549,CANTO XXIII.,"and I am in the body that I have always had. But ye, who are ye, in"
3550,CANTO XXIII.,"whom such woe distills, as I see, down your cheeks? and what punishment"
3551,CANTO XXIII.,"is on you that so sparkles?” And one of them replied to me, “The orange"
3552,CANTO XXIII.,hoods are of lead so thick that the weights thus make their scales to
3553,CANTO XXIII.,"creak. Jovial Friars[2] were we, and Bolognese; I Catalano, and he"
3554,CANTO XXIII.,"Loderingo named, and together taken by thy city, as one man alone is"
3555,CANTO XXIII.,"wont to be taken, in order to preserve its peace; and we were such as"
3556,CANTO XXIII.,"still is apparent round about the Gardingo.” I began, “O Friars, your"
3557,CANTO XXIII.,"evil”—but more I said not, for there struck mine eyes one crucified"
3558,CANTO XXIII.,"with three stakes on the ground. When me he saw he writhed all over,"
3559,CANTO XXIII.,"blowing into his beard with sighs: and the Friar Catalano, who observed"
3560,CANTO XXIII.,"it, said to me, “That transfixed one, whom thou lookest at, counseled"
3561,CANTO XXIII.,the Pharisees that it was expedient to put one man to torture for the
3562,CANTO XXIII.,"people. Crosswise and naked is he on the path, as thou seest, and he"
3563,CANTO XXIII.,first must feel how much whoever passes weighs. And in such fashion his
3564,CANTO XXIII.,"father-in-law is stretched in this ditch, and the others of that"
3565,CANTO XXIII.,Council which for the Jews was seed of ill.”[3] Then I saw Virgil
3566,CANTO XXIII.,marvelling over him that was extended on a cross so vilely in eternal
3567,CANTO XXIII.,"exile. Thereafter he addressed this speech to the Friar, “May it not"
3568,CANTO XXIII.,"displease thee, so it be allowed thee, to tell us if on the right hand"
3569,CANTO XXIII.,lies any opening whereby we two can go out without constraining any of
3570,CANTO XXIII.,the Black Angels to come to deliver us from this deep.” He answered
3571,CANTO XXIII.,"then, “Nearer than thou hopest is a rock that from the great encircling"
3572,CANTO XXIII.,"wall proceeds and crosses all the savage valleys, save that at this one"
3573,CANTO XXIII.,"it is broken, and does not cover it. Ye can mount up over the ruin that"
3574,CANTO XXIII.,"slopes on the side, and heaps up at the bottom.” The Leader stood a"
3575,CANTO XXIII.,"little while with bowed head, then said, “Ill he reported the matter,"
3576,CANTO XXIII.,"he who hooks the sinners yonder.”[4] And the Friar, “I once heard tell"
3577,CANTO XXIII.,"at Bologna vices enough of the devil, among which I heard that he is"
3578,CANTO XXIII.,"false, and the father of lies.” Then the Leader with great steps went"
3579,CANTO XXIII.,"on, disturbed a little with anger in his look; whereon I departed from"
3580,CANTO XXIII.,"the heavily burdened ones, following the prints of the beloved feet."
3581,CANTO XXIII.,
3582,CANTO XXIII.,[1] They could not raise their heads for a straight look.

3586,CANTO XXIII.,knightly vows and high intent. From their free life the name of “Jovial
3587,CANTO XXIII.,Friars” was given to the members of the order. After the battle of
3588,CANTO XXIII.,Montaperti (1260) the Ghibellines held the upper hand in Florence for
3589,CANTO XXIII.,"more than five years. The defeat and death of Manfred early in 1266, at"
3590,CANTO XXIII.,"the battle of Benevento, shook their power and revived the hopes of the"
3591,CANTO XXIII.,"Guelphs. As a measure of compromise, the Florentine Commune elected two"
3592,CANTO XXIII.,"podestas, one from each party; the Guelph was Catalano de’ Malavolti,"
3593,CANTO XXIII.,"the Ghibelline, Loderingo degli Andalo, both from Bologna. They were"
3594,CANTO XXIII.,"believed to have joined hands for their own gain, and to have favored"
3595,CANTO XXIII.,the reviving power of the Guelphs. In the troubles of the year the
3596,CANTO XXIII.,"houses of the Uberti, a powerful Ghibelline family, were burned. They"
3597,CANTO XXIII.,"lay in the region of the city called the Gardingo, close to the Palazzo"

3624,CANTO XXIV.,"but the point of her pen lasts little while, the rustic, whose"
3625,CANTO XXIV.,"provision fails “gets up and sees the plain all whitened o’er, whereat"
3626,CANTO XXIV.,"he strikes his thigh, returns indoors, and grumbles here and there,"
3627,CANTO XXIV.,like the poor wretch who knows not what to do; again goes out and picks
3628,CANTO XXIV.,"up hope again, seeing the world to have changed face in short while,"
3629,CANTO XXIV.,and takes his crook and drives forth his flock to pasture”: in like
3630,CANTO XXIV.,"manner the Master made me dismayed, when I saw his front so disturbed,"
3631,CANTO XXIV.,and in like manner speedily arrived the plaster for the hurt. For when
3632,CANTO XXIV.,"we came to the ruined bridge, the Leader turned to me with that sweet"
3633,CANTO XXIV.,"look which I first saw at the foot of the mount.[4] He opened his arms,"
3634,CANTO XXIV.,"after some counsel taken with himself, looking first well at the ruin,"
3635,CANTO XXIV.,"and laid hold of me. And as one who acts and considers, who seems"
3636,CANTO XXIV.,"always to be ready beforehand, so lifting me up toward the top of a"
3637,CANTO XXIV.,"great rock, he took note of another splinter, saying, “Seize hold next"
3638,CANTO XXIV.,"on that, but try first if it is such that it may support thee.” It was"
3639,CANTO XXIV.,"no way for one clothed in a cloak, for we with difficulty, he light and"
3640,CANTO XXIV.,"I pushed up, could mount from jag to jag. And had it not been that on"
3641,CANTO XXIV.,"that precinct the bank was shorter than on the other side, I do not"
3642,CANTO XXIV.,"know about him, but I should have been completely overcome. But because"
3643,CANTO XXIV.,"all Malebolge slopes toward the opening of the lowest abyss, the site"
3644,CANTO XXIV.,of each valley is such that one side rises and the other sinks.[5] We
3645,CANTO XXIV.,"came, however, at length, up to the point where the last stone is"
3646,CANTO XXIV.,broken off. The breath was so milked from my lungs when I was up that I
3647,CANTO XXIV.,"could no farther, but sat me down on first arrival."

3667,CANTO XXIV.,"“Now it behoves thee thus to put off sloth,” said the Master, “for,"
3668,CANTO XXIV.,"sitting upon down or under quilt, one attains not fame, without which"
3669,CANTO XXIV.,he who consumes his life leaves of himself such trace on earth as smoke
3670,CANTO XXIV.,"in air, or in water the foam. And therefore rise up, conquer the"
3671,CANTO XXIV.,"exhaustion with the spirit that conquers every battle, if by its heavy"
3672,CANTO XXIV.,body it be not dragged down. A longer stairway needs must be ascended;
3673,CANTO XXIV.,"it is not enough from these to have departed; if thou understandest me,"
3674,CANTO XXIV.,"now act so that it avail thee.” Then I rose up, showing myself"
3675,CANTO XXIV.,"furnished better with breath than I felt, and said, “Go on, for I am"
3676,CANTO XXIV.,strong and resolute.”
3677,CANTO XXIV.,
3678,CANTO XXIV.,"Up along the crag we took the way, which was rugged, narrow, and"
3679,CANTO XXIV.,"difficult, and far steeper than the one before. I was going along"
3680,CANTO XXIV.,"speaking in order not to seem breathless, and a voice, unsuitable for"
3681,CANTO XXIV.,"forming words, came out from the next ditch. I know not what it said,"
3682,CANTO XXIV.,though I was already upon the back of the arch that crosses here; but
3683,CANTO XXIV.,"he who was speaking seemed moved to anger. I had turned downwards, but"
3684,CANTO XXIV.,"living eyes could not go to the bottom, because of the obscurity."
3685,CANTO XXIV.,"Wherefore I said, “Master, see that thou go on to the next girth, and"
3686,CANTO XXIV.,"let us descend the wall, for as from hence I hear and do not"
3687,CANTO XXIV.,"understand, so I look down and shape out nothing.” “Other reply,” he"
3688,CANTO XXIV.,"said, “I give thee not than doing, for an honest request ought to be"
3689,CANTO XXIV.,followed by the deed in silence.”
3690,CANTO XXIV.,
3691,CANTO XXIV.,"We descended the bridge at its head, where it joins on with the eighth"
3692,CANTO XXIV.,"bank, and then the pit was apparent to me. And I saw therewithin a"
3693,CANTO XXIV.,"terrible heap of serpents, and of such hideous look that the memory"
3694,CANTO XXIV.,still curdles my blood. Let Libya with her sand vaunt herself no more;
3695,CANTO XXIV.,"for though she brings forth chelydri, jaculi, and phareae, and cenchri"
3696,CANTO XXIV.,"with amphisboena, she never, with all Ethiopia, nor with the land that"
3697,CANTO XXIV.,"lies on the Red Sea, showed either so many plagues or so evil."
3698,CANTO XXIV.,
3699,CANTO XXIV.,Amid this cruel and most dismal store were running people naked and in
3700,CANTO XXIV.,"terror, without hope of hole or heliotrope.[1] They had their hands"
3701,CANTO XXIV.,"tied behind with serpents, which fixed through the reins their tail and"
3702,CANTO XXIV.,"their head, and were knotted up in front."

3710,CANTO XXIV.,"was ever so quickly written as he took fire and burned, and all ashes"
3711,CANTO XXIV.,it behoved him to become in falling. And when upon the ground he lay
3712,CANTO XXIV.,"thus destroyed, the dust drew together of itself, and into that same"
3713,CANTO XXIV.,one instantly returned. Thus by the great sages it is affirmed that the
3714,CANTO XXIV.,"Phoenix dies, and then is reborn when to her five hundredth year she"
3715,CANTO XXIV.,"draws nigh. Nor herb nor grain she feeds on in her life, but only on"
3716,CANTO XXIV.,"tears of incense and on balsam, and nard and myrrh are her last"
3717,CANTO XXIV.,winding-sheet.
3718,CANTO XXIV.,
3719,CANTO XXIV.,"And as he who falls and knows not how, by force of demon that drags him"

3721,CANTO XXIV.,"around him gazes, all bewildered by the great anguish that he has"
3722,CANTO XXIV.,"suffered, and in looking sighs, such was that sinner after he had"
3723,CANTO XXIV.,risen. Oh power of God! how just thou art that showerest down such
3724,CANTO XXIV.,blows for vengeance!
3725,CANTO XXIV.,
3726,CANTO XXIV.,"The Leader asked him then who he was; whereon he answered, “I rained"
3727,CANTO XXIV.,"from Tuscany short time ago into this fell gullet. Bestial life, and"
3728,CANTO XXIV.,"not human, pleased me, like a mule that I was. I am Vanni Fucci, beast,"
3729,CANTO XXIV.,"and Pistoia was my fitting den.” And I to my Leader, “Tell him not to"
3730,CANTO XXIV.,"budge, and ask what sin thrust him down here, for I have seen him a man"
3731,CANTO XXIV.,"of blood and rages.” And the sinner who heard dissembled not, but"
3732,CANTO XXIV.,"directed toward me his mind and his face, and was painted with dismal"
3733,CANTO XXIV.,"shame. Then he said, “More it grieves me, that thou hast caught me in"
3734,CANTO XXIV.,"the misery where thou seest me, than when I was taken from the other"
3735,CANTO XXIV.,life. I cannot refuse that which thou demandest. I am put so far down
3736,CANTO XXIV.,"because I was robber of the sacristy with the fair furnishings, and"
3737,CANTO XXIV.,falsely hitherto has it been ascribed to another.[1] But that thou
3738,CANTO XXIV.,"enjoy not this sight, if ever thou shalt be forth of these dark places,"
3739,CANTO XXIV.,open thine ears to my announcement and hear.[2] Pistoia first strips
3740,CANTO XXIV.,"itself of the Black, then Florence renovates her people and her"

3743,CANTO XXIV.,"Piceno, where it shall suddenly rend the mist, so that every White"
3744,CANTO XXIV.,shall thereby be smitten. And this have I said because it must grieve

3800,CANTO XXV.,"wherefor his crooked deeds ceased under the club of Hercules, who"
3801,CANTO XXV.,"perhaps dealt him a hundred blows with it, and he felt not ten.”"
3802,CANTO XXV.,
3803,CANTO XXV.,"While he was so speaking, and that one had run by, lo! three spirits"
3804,CANTO XXV.,"came below us, of whom neither I nor my Leader was aware till when they"
3805,CANTO XXV.,"cried out, “Who are ye?” whereon our story stopped, and we then"
3806,CANTO XXV.,"attended only unto them. I did not recognize them, but it happened, as"
3807,CANTO XXV.,"it is wont to happen by chance, that one must needs name the other,"
3808,CANTO XXV.,"saying, “Cianfa, where can he have stayed?” Whereupon I, in order that"
3809,CANTO XXV.,"the Leader should attend, put my finger upward from my chin to my nose."
3810,CANTO XXV.,
3811,CANTO XXV.,"If thou art now, Reader, slow to credit that which I shall tell, it"
3812,CANTO XXV.,"will not be a marvel, for I who saw it hardly admit it to myself. As I"
3813,CANTO XXV.,"was holding my brow raised upon them, lo! a serpent with six feet darts"
3814,CANTO XXV.,"in front of one, and grapples close to him. With his middle feet he"
3815,CANTO XXV.,"clasped his paunch, and with his forward took his arms, then struck his"
3816,CANTO XXV.,fangs in one and the other cheek. His hinder feet he stretched upon the
3817,CANTO XXV.,"thighs, and put his tail between the two, and behind bent it up along"
3818,CANTO XXV.,"the reins. Ivy was never so bearded to a tree, as the horrible beast"
3819,CANTO XXV.,through the other’s limbs entwined his own. Then they stuck together as
3820,CANTO XXV.,"if they had been of hot wax, and mingled their color; nor one nor the"
3821,CANTO XXV.,"other seemed now that which it was; even as before the flame, up along"
3822,CANTO XXV.,"the paper a dark color proceeds which is not yet black, and the white"
3823,CANTO XXV.,"dies away. The other two were looking on, and each cried, “O me!"
3824,CANTO XXV.,"Agnello, how thou changest! Lo, now thou art neither two nor one! Now"
3825,CANTO XXV.,"were the two heads become one, when there appeared to us two"
3826,CANTO XXV.,countenances mixed in one face wherein the two were lost. Of four[1]
3827,CANTO XXV.,"strips the two arms were made; the thighs with the legs, the belly and"
3828,CANTO XXV.,the chest became members that were never seen before. Each original
3829,CANTO XXV.,aspect there was cancelled; both and neither the perverse image
3830,CANTO XXV.,"appeared, and such it went away with slow step."
3831,CANTO XXV.,
3832,CANTO XXV.,[1] The two fore feet of the dragon and the two arms of the man were
3833,CANTO XXV.,melted into two strange arms.
3834,CANTO XXV.,
3835,CANTO XXV.,
3836,CANTO XXV.,"As the lizard under the great scourge of the dog days, changing from"
3837,CANTO XXV.,"hedge to hedge, seems a flash, if it crosses the way, so seemed, coming"
3838,CANTO XXV.,"toward the belly of the two others, a little fiery serpent, livid, and"
3839,CANTO XXV.,black as a grain of pepper. And that part whereby our nourishment is
3840,CANTO XXV.,"first taken it transfixed in one of them, then fell down stretched out"
3841,CANTO XXV.,"before him. The transfixed one gazed at it, but said nothing; nay"
3842,CANTO XXV.,"rather, with feet fixed, he yawned even as if sleep or fever had"
3843,CANTO XXV.,"assailed him. He looked at the serpent, and that at him; one through"
3844,CANTO XXV.,"his wound, the other through his mouth, smoked violently, and their"
3845,CANTO XXV.,"smoke met. Let Lucan henceforth be silent, where he tells of the"
3846,CANTO XXV.,"wretched Sabellus, and of Nasidius, and wait to hear that which now is"
3847,CANTO XXV.,"uttered. Let Ovid be silent concerning Cadmus and Arethusa, for if,"
3848,CANTO XXV.,"poetizing, he converts him into a serpent and her into a fountain, I"
3849,CANTO XXV.,"envy him not; for two natures front to front never did he transmute, so"
3850,CANTO XXV.,that both the forms were prompt to exchange their matter. To one
3851,CANTO XXV.,"another they responded by such rules, that the serpent made his tail"
3852,CANTO XXV.,"into a fork, and the wounded one drew together his feet. The legs and"
3853,CANTO XXV.,"the very thighs with them so stuck together, that in short while the"
3854,CANTO XXV.,juncture made no sign that was apparent. The cleft tail took on the
3855,CANTO XXV.,"shape that was lost there, and its skin became soft, and that of the"
3856,CANTO XXV.,"other hard. I saw the arms draw in through the armpits, and the two"
3857,CANTO XXV.,feet of the beast which were short lengthen out in proportion as those
3858,CANTO XXV.,"shortened. Then the hinder feet, twisted together, became the member"
3859,CANTO XXV.,"that man conceals, and the wretched one from his had two[1] stretched"
3860,CANTO XXV.,forth.
3861,CANTO XXV.,
3862,CANTO XXV.,[1] Hinder feet.
3863,CANTO XXV.,
3864,CANTO XXV.,
3865,CANTO XXV.,"While the smoke is veiling both with a new color, and generates hair on"
3866,CANTO XXV.,"the one, and from the other strips it, one rose up, and the other fell"
3867,CANTO XXV.,"down, not however turning aside their pitiless lights,[1] beneath which"
3868,CANTO XXV.,each was changing his visage. He who was erect drew his in toward the
3869,CANTO XXV.,"temples, and, from the excess of material that came in there, issued"
3870,CANTO XXV.,the ears on the smooth cheeks; that which did not run backwards but was
3871,CANTO XXV.,"retained, of its superfluity made a nose for the face, and thickened"
3872,CANTO XXV.,the lips so far as was needful. He who was lying down drives his muzzle
3873,CANTO XXV.,"forward, and draws in his ears through his skull, as the snail doth his"
3874,CANTO XXV.,"horns. And his tongue, which erst was united and fit for speech,"
3875,CANTO XXV.,"cleaves itself, and the forked one of the other closes up; and the"
3876,CANTO XXV.,smoke stops. The soul that had become a brute fled hissing along the
3877,CANTO XXV.,"valley, and behind him the other speaking spits. Then he turned upon"
3878,CANTO XXV.,"him his new shoulders, and said to the other,[2] “I will that Buoso[3]"
3879,CANTO XXV.,"run, as I have done, groveling along this path.”"

3891,CANTO XXV.,"novelty be my excuse, if my pen straggle[2] a little. And although my"
3892,CANTO XXV.,"eyes were somewhat confused, and my mind bewildered, those could not"
3893,CANTO XXV.,flee away so covertly but that I clearly distinguished Puccio
3894,CANTO XXV.,"Sciancato, and he it was who alone, of the three companions that had"
3895,CANTO XXV.,"first come, was not changed; the other[3] was he whom thou, Gaville,"

3907,CANTO XXV.,"thieves, Agnello, Buoso, and Puccio. Cianfa Donati had then appeared as"
3908,CANTO XXV.,"the serpent with six feet, and had been incorporated with Agnello."

3936,CANTO XXVI.,"pursuing the solitary way mid the splinters and rocks of the crag, the"
3937,CANTO XXVI.,"foot without the hand sped not. Then I grieved, and now I grieve again"
3938,CANTO XXVI.,when I direct my mind to what I saw; and I curb my genius more than I
3939,CANTO XXVI.,"am wont, that it may not run unless virtue guide it; so that if a good"

3972,CANTO XXVI.,taken hold of a rock I should have fallen below without being pushed.
3973,CANTO XXVI.,"And the Leader, who saw me thus attent, said, “Within these fires are"
3974,CANTO XXVI.,the spirits; each is swathed by that wherewith he is enkindled.” “My
3975,CANTO XXVI.,"Master,” I replied, “by hearing thee am I more certain, but already I"
3976,CANTO XXVI.,"deemed that it was so, and already I wished to say to thee, Who is in"
3977,CANTO XXVI.,that fire that cometh so divided at its top that it seems to rise from
3978,CANTO XXVI.,the pyre on which Eteocles was put with his brother?”[1] He answered
3979,CANTO XXVI.,"me, “There within are tormented Ulysses and Diomed, and thus together"
3980,CANTO XXVI.,"they go in punishment, as of old in wrath.[2] And within their flame"
3981,CANTO XXVI.,"they groan for the ambush of the horse that made the gate, whence the"
3982,CANTO XXVI.,gentle seed of the Romans issued forth. Within it they lament for the
3983,CANTO XXVI.,"artifice whereby the dead Deidamia still mourns for Achilles, and there"
3984,CANTO XXVI.,for the Palladium they bear the penalty.” “If they can speak within
3985,CANTO XXVI.,"those sparkles,” said I, “Master, much I pray thee, and repray that the"
3986,CANTO XXVI.,"prayer avail a thousand, that thou make not to me denial of waiting"
3987,CANTO XXVI.,till the horned flame come hither; thou seest that with desire I bend

3989,CANTO XXVI.,"therefore I accept it, but take heed that thy tongue restrain itself."
3990,CANTO XXVI.,"Leave speech to me, for I have conceived what thou wishest, for,"

4005,CANTO XXVI.,"horse that Troy was destroyed, and Aeneas thus compelled to lead forth"
4006,CANTO XXVI.,his followers who became the seed of the Romans. Deidamia was the wife
4007,CANTO XXVI.,"of Achilles, who slew herself for grief at his desertion and departure"
4008,CANTO XXVI.,"for Troy, which had been brought about by the deceit of Ulysses and"
4009,CANTO XXVI.,"Diomed. The Palladium was the statue of Athena, on which the safety of"

4016,CANTO XXVI.,
4017,CANTO XXVI.,When the flame had come there where it seemed to my Leader time and
4018,CANTO XXVI.,"place, in this form I heard him speak to it: “O ye who are two within"
4019,CANTO XXVI.,"one fire, if I deserved of you while I lived, if I deserved of you much"
4020,CANTO XXVI.,"or little, when in the world I wrote the lofty verses, move not, but"
4021,CANTO XXVI.,"let one of you tell us, where, having lost himself, he went away to"
4022,CANTO XXVI.,"die.” The greater horn of the ancient flame began to waver, murmuring,"
4023,CANTO XXVI.,even as a flame that the wind wearies. Then moving its tip hither and
4024,CANTO XXVI.,"thither, as it had been the tongue that would speak, it cast forth a"
4025,CANTO XXVI.,"voice, and said,—"
4026,CANTO XXVI.,
4027,CANTO XXVI.,"“When I departed from Circe, who had retained me more than a year there"
4028,CANTO XXVI.,"near to Gaeta, before Aeneas had so named it, neither fondness for my"
4029,CANTO XXVI.,"son, nor piety for my old father, nor the due love that should have"
4030,CANTO XXVI.,"made Penelope glad, could overcome within me the ardor that I had to"
4031,CANTO XXVI.,"gain experience of the world, and of the vices of men, and of their"
4032,CANTO XXVI.,"valor. But I put forth on the deep, open sea, with one vessel only, and"
4033,CANTO XXVI.,with that little company by which I had not been deserted. One shore
4034,CANTO XXVI.,"and the other[1] I saw as far as Spain, far as Morocco and the island"
4035,CANTO XXVI.,"of Sardinia, and the rest which that sea bathes round about. I and my"
4036,CANTO XXVI.,companions were old and slow when we came to that narrow strait where
4037,CANTO XXVI.,"Hercules set up his bounds, to the end that man may not put out"
4038,CANTO XXVI.,"beyond.[2] On the right hand I left Seville, on the other already I had"
4039,CANTO XXVI.,"left Ceuta. ‘O brothers,’ said I, ‘who through a hundred thousand"
4040,CANTO XXVI.,"perils have reached the West, to this so little vigil of your senses"
4041,CANTO XXVI.,"that remains be ye unwilling to deny, the experience, following the"
4042,CANTO XXVI.,"sun, of the world that hath no people. Consider ye your origin; ye were"
4043,CANTO XXVI.,"not made to live as brutes, but for pursuit of virtue and of"
4044,CANTO XXVI.,knowledge.’ With this little speech I made my companions so eager for
4045,CANTO XXVI.,the road that hardly afterwards could I have held them back. And
4046,CANTO XXVI.,"turning our stern to the morning, with our oars we made wings for the"
4047,CANTO XXVI.,"mad flight, always gaining on the left hand side. The night saw now all"
4048,CANTO XXVI.,"the stars of the other pole, and ours so low that it rose not forth"
4049,CANTO XXVI.,from the ocean floor. Five times rekindled and as many quenched was the
4050,CANTO XXVI.,"light beneath the moon, since we had entered on the deep pass, when"
4051,CANTO XXVI.,"there appeared to us a mountain dim through the distance, and it"
4052,CANTO XXVI.,"appeared to me so high as I had not seen any. We rejoiced thereat, and"
4053,CANTO XXVI.,"soon it turned to lamentation, for from the strange land a whirlwind"
4054,CANTO XXVI.,"rose, and struck the fore part of the vessel. Three times it made her"
4055,CANTO XXVI.,"whirl with all the waters, the fourth it made her stern lift up, and"

4076,CANTO XXVII.,confused sound that issued forth therefrom. As the Sicilian
4077,CANTO XXVII.,bull[1]—that bellowed first with the plaint of him (and that was right)
4078,CANTO XXVII.,who had shaped it with his file—was wont to bellow with the voice of

4082,CANTO XXVII.,"But when they had taken their course up through the point, giving it"

4161,CANTO XXVII.,"“I was a man of arms, and then became a cordelier, trusting, thus girt,"

4163,CANTO XXVII.,"Great Priest,[1] whom may ill betide! who set me back into my first"
4164,CANTO XXVII.,"sins; and how and wherefore, I will that thou hear from me. While I was"
4165,CANTO XXVII.,"that form of bone and flesh that my mother gave me, my works were not"
4166,CANTO XXVII.,"leonine, but of the fox. The wily practices, and the covert ways, I"
4167,CANTO XXVII.,"knew them all, and I so plied their art that to the earth’s end the"
4168,CANTO XXVII.,sound went forth. When I saw me arrived at that part of my age where
4169,CANTO XXVII.,"every one ought to strike the sails and to coil up the ropes, what erst"
4170,CANTO XXVII.,"was pleasing to me then gave me pain, and I yielded me repentant and"
4171,CANTO XXVII.,confessed. Alas me wretched! and it would have availed. The Prince of
4172,CANTO XXVII.,"the new Pharisees having war near the Lateran,[2]—and not with Saracens"
4173,CANTO XXVII.,"nor with Jews, for every enemy of his was Christian, and none of them"

4176,CANTO XXVII.,"orders, nor in me that cord which is wont to make those girt with it"
4177,CANTO XXVII.,more lean; but as Constantine besought Sylvester within Soracte to cure
4178,CANTO XXVII.,"his leprosy,[4] so this one besought me as master to cure his proud"
4179,CANTO XXVII.,"fever. He asked counsel of me, and I kept silence, because his words"
4180,CANTO XXVII.,"seemed drunken. And then he said to me, ‘Let not thy heart mistrust;"
4181,CANTO XXVII.,"from now I absolve thee, and do thou teach me to act so that I may"
4182,CANTO XXVII.,"throw Palestrina to the ground. Heaven can I lock and unlock, as thou"
4183,CANTO XXVII.,knowest; for two are the keys that my predecessor held not dear.’ Then
4184,CANTO XXVII.,"his grave arguments pushed me to where silence seemed to me the worst,"
4185,CANTO XXVII.,"and I said, ‘Father, since thou washest me of that sin wherein I now"
4186,CANTO XXVII.,"must fall, long promise with short keeping will make thee triumph on"
4187,CANTO XXVII.,"the High Seat.’ Francis[5] came for me afterwards, when I was dead, but"
4188,CANTO XXVII.,"one of the Black Cherubim said to him, ‘Bear him not away; do me not"
4189,CANTO XXVII.,wrong; he must come down among my drudges because he gave the
4190,CANTO XXVII.,"fraudulent counsel, since which till now I have been at his hair; for"
4191,CANTO XXVII.,"he who repents not cannot be absolved, nor can repentance and will"
4192,CANTO XXVII.,"exist together, because of the contradiction that allows it not.’ O"
4193,CANTO XXVII.,"woeful me! how I shuddered when he took me, saying to me, ‘Perhaps thou"
4194,CANTO XXVII.,didst not think that I was a logician.’ To Minos he bore me; and he
4195,CANTO XXVII.,"twined his tail eight times round his hard back, and, after he had"
4196,CANTO XXVII.,"bitten it in great rage, he said, ‘This is one of the sinners of the"
4197,CANTO XXVII.,"thievish fire.’ Therefore I, where thou seest, am lost, and going thus"

4381,CANTO XXVIII.,"it was making for itself a lamp; and they were two in one, and one in"
4382,CANTO XXVIII.,two. How it can be He knows who so ordains. When it was right at the
4383,CANTO XXVIII.,"foot of the bridge, it lifted its arm high with the whole head, in"
4384,CANTO XXVIII.,"order to approach its words to us, which were, “Now see the dire"

4469,CANTO XXIX.,
4470,CANTO XXIX.,"I saw two seated leaning on each other, as pan is leaned against pan to"

4826,CANTO XXXI.,"so that the tower hangs counter to it, thus seemed Antaeus to me that"
4827,CANTO XXXI.,stood attent to see him bend; and it was a moment when I could have
4828,CANTO XXXI.,wished to go by another road. But lightly on the bottom that swallows
4829,CANTO XXXI.,"Lucifer with Judas he set us down; nor, thus bent, did he there make"

5070,CANTO XXXIII.,"towns of which the Pisans had made themselves masters. He, with his"

5106,CANTO XXXIII.,"their four faces my own very aspect, both my hands I bit for woe; and"
5107,CANTO XXXIII.,"they, thinking I did it through desire of eating, of a sudden rose, and"
5108,CANTO XXXIII.,"said, ‘Father, it will be far less pain to us if thou eat of us; thou"

5110,CANTO XXXIII.,"quieted me then, not to make them more sad: that day and the next we"
5111,CANTO XXXIII.,"all stayed dumb. Ah, thou hard earth! why didst thou not open? After we"
5112,CANTO XXXIII.,"had come to the fourth day, Gaddo threw himself stretched out at my"
5113,CANTO XXXIII.,"feet, saying, ‘My father, why dost thou not help me?’ Here he died:"
5114,CANTO XXXIII.,"and, even as thou seest me, I saw the three fall one by one between the"
5115,CANTO XXXIII.,"fifth day and the sixth; then I betook me, already blind, to groping"

5157,CANTO XXXIII.,"cruel that the last station is given to you, lift from my eyes the hard"
5158,CANTO XXXIII.,"veils, so that I may vent the grief that swells my heart, a little ere"
5159,CANTO XXXIII.,"the weeping re-congeal!” Wherefore I to him, “If thou wilt that I"
5160,CANTO XXXIII.,"relieve thee, tell me who thou art, and if I rid thee not, may it be"
5161,CANTO XXXIII.,"mine to go to the bottom of the ice.” He replied then, “I am friar"
5162,CANTO XXXIII.,"Alberigo;[1] I am he of the fruits of the bad garden, and here I"
5163,CANTO XXXIII.,receive a date for a fig.”[2] “Oh!” said I to him; “art thou now
5164,CANTO XXXIII.,"already dead?” And he to me, “How it may go with my body in the world"
5165,CANTO XXXIII.,above I bear no knowledge. Such vantage hath this Ptolomaea[3] that
5166,CANTO XXXIII.,oftentime the soul falls hither ere Atropos hath given motion to it.[4]
5167,CANTO XXXIII.,And that thou may the more willingly scrape the glassy tears from my
5168,CANTO XXXIII.,"face, know that soon as the soul betrays, as I did, its body is taken"
5169,CANTO XXXIII.,"from it by a demon, who thereafter governs it until its time be all"
5170,CANTO XXXIII.,"revolved. The soul falls headlong into this cistern, and perchance the"
5171,CANTO XXXIII.,body of the shade that here behind me winters still appears above; thou
5172,CANTO XXXIII.,oughtest to know him if thou comest down but now. He is Ser Branca d’
5173,CANTO XXXIII.,"Oria,[5] and many years have passed since he was thus shut up.” “I"
5174,CANTO XXXIII.,"think,” said I to him, “that thou deceivest me, for Branca d’ Oria is"
5175,CANTO XXXIII.,"not yet dead, and he eats, and drinks, and sleeps, and puts on"
5176,CANTO XXXIII.,"clothes.” “In the ditch of the Malebranche above,” he said, “there"
5177,CANTO XXXIII.,"where the tenacious pitch is boiling, Michel Zanche had not yet arrived"
5178,CANTO XXXIII.,"when this one left in his own stead a devil in his body, and in that of"
5179,CANTO XXXIII.,"one of his near kin, who committed the treachery together with him. But"
5180,CANTO XXXIII.,now stretch out hither thy hand; open my eyes for me.” And I opened
5181,CANTO XXXIII.,"them not for him, and to be rude to him was courtesy."
5182,CANTO XXXIII.,
5183,CANTO XXXIII.,"[1] Alberigo de’ Manfredi, of Faenza; one of the Jovial Friars (see"
5184,CANTO XXXIII.,"Canto xxiii). Having received a blow from one of his kinsmen, he"
5185,CANTO XXXIII.,"pretended to forgive it, and invited him and his son to a feast. Toward"
5186,CANTO XXXIII.,"the end of the meal he gave a preconcerted signal by calling out,"
5187,CANTO XXXIII.,"“Bring the fruit,” upon which his emissaries rushed in and killed the"
5188,CANTO XXXIII.,two guests. The “fruit of Brother Alberigo” became a proverb.

5226,CANTO XXXIV.,"hemisphere grows dark with night, such a structure then it seemed to me"

5228,CANTO XXXIV.,
5229,CANTO XXXIV.,[1] “The banners of the King of Hell advance.” Vexilla Regis prodeunt

5237,CANTO XXXIV.,"where the shades were wholly covered, and showed through like a straw"
5238,CANTO XXXIV.,"in glass. Some are lying; some stand erect, this on his head, and that"
5239,CANTO XXXIV.,on his soles; another like a bow inverts his face to his feet.
5240,CANTO XXXIV.,
5241,CANTO XXXIV.,"[1] In the fourth, innermost ring of ice of the ninth circle, the"

5243,CANTO XXXIV.,
5244,CANTO XXXIV.,
5245,CANTO XXXIV.,When we had gone so far forward that it pleased my Master to show me
5246,CANTO XXXIV.,"the creature that had the fair semblance, from before me he took"
5247,CANTO XXXIV.,"himself and made me stop, saying, “Behold Dis, and behold the place"
5248,CANTO XXXIV.,where it is needful that with fortitude thou arm thee.” How I became
5249,CANTO XXXIV.,"then chilled and hoarse, ask it not, Reader, for I write it not,"
5250,CANTO XXXIV.,"because all speech would be little. I did not die, and I did not remain"
5251,CANTO XXXIV.,"alive. Think now for thyself, if thou hast grain of wit, what I became,"
5252,CANTO XXXIV.,deprived of one and the other.
5253,CANTO XXXIV.,
5254,CANTO XXXIV.,The emperor of the woeful realm from his midbreast issued forth from
5255,CANTO XXXIV.,"the ice; and I match better with a giant, than the giants do with his"
5256,CANTO XXXIV.,arms. See now how great must be that whole which corresponds to such
5257,CANTO XXXIV.,"parts. If he was as fair as he now is foul, and against his Maker"
5258,CANTO XXXIV.,"lifted up his brow, surely may all tribulation proceed from him. Oh how"
5259,CANTO XXXIV.,"great a marvel it seemed to me, when I saw three faces on his head! one"
5260,CANTO XXXIV.,"in front, and that was red; the others were two that were joined to"
5261,CANTO XXXIV.,"this above the very middle of each shoulder, and they were joined"
5262,CANTO XXXIV.,together at the place of the crest; and the right seemed between white
5263,CANTO XXXIV.,"and yellow, the left was such to sight as those who come from where the"
5264,CANTO XXXIV.,"Nile flows valleyward. Beneath each came forth two great wings, of size"
5265,CANTO XXXIV.,befitting so huge a bird. Sails of the sea never saw I such. They had
5266,CANTO XXXIV.,"no feathers, but their fashion was of a bat; and he was flapping them"
5267,CANTO XXXIV.,"so that three winds went forth from him, whereby Cocytus was all"
5268,CANTO XXXIV.,"congealed. With six eyes he was weeping, and over three chins trickled"
5269,CANTO XXXIV.,the tears and bloody drivel. With each mouth he was crushing a sinner
5270,CANTO XXXIV.,"with his teeth, in manner of a brake, so that he thus was making three"
5271,CANTO XXXIV.,of them woeful. To the one in front the biting was nothing to the
5272,CANTO XXXIV.,"clawing, so that sometimes his spine remained all stripped of skin."
5273,CANTO XXXIV.,
5274,CANTO XXXIV.,"“That soul up there which has the greatest punishment,” said the"
5275,CANTO XXXIV.,"Master, “is Judas Iscariot, who has his head within, and plies his legs"
5276,CANTO XXXIV.,"outside. Of the other two who have their heads down, he who hangs from"
5277,CANTO XXXIV.,the black muzzle is Brutus; see how he writhes and says no word; and
5278,CANTO XXXIV.,"the other is Cassius, who seems so large-limbed. But the night is"
5279,CANTO XXXIV.,"rising again, and now we must depart, for we have seen the whole.”"
5280,CANTO XXXIV.,
5281,CANTO XXXIV.,"As was his pleasure, I clasped his neck, and he took opportunity of"
5282,CANTO XXXIV.,"time and place, and when the wings were opened wide he caught hold on"
5283,CANTO XXXIV.,the shaggy flanks; from shag to shag he then descended between the
5284,CANTO XXXIV.,bushy hair and the frozen crusts. When we were just where the thigh
5285,CANTO XXXIV.,"turns on the thick of the haunch, my Leader, with effort and stress of"
5286,CANTO XXXIV.,"breath, turned his head where he had his shanks, and clambered by the"
5287,CANTO XXXIV.,"hair as a man that ascends, so that I thought to return again to hell."
5288,CANTO XXXIV.,
5289,CANTO XXXIV.,"“Cling fast hold,” said the Master, panting like one weary, “for by"
5290,CANTO XXXIV.,such stairs it behoves to depart from so much evil.” Then he came forth
5291,CANTO XXXIV.,"through the opening of a rock, and placed me upon its edge to sit; then"
5292,CANTO XXXIV.,stretched toward me his cautious step.
5293,CANTO XXXIV.,
5294,CANTO XXXIV.,"I raised my eyes, and thought to see Lucifer as I had left him, and I"
5295,CANTO XXXIV.,"saw him holding his legs upward. And if I then became perplexed, let"
5296,CANTO XXXIV.,the dull folk think it that see not what that point is that I had
5297,CANTO XXXIV.,passed.[1]
5298,CANTO XXXIV.,
5299,CANTO XXXIV.,[1] This point is the centre of the universe; when Virgil had turned
5300,CANTO XXXIV.,"upon the haunch of Lucifer, the passage had been made from one"
5301,CANTO XXXIV.,hemisphere of the earth—the inhabited and known hemisphere— to the
5302,CANTO XXXIV.,"other where no living men dwell, and where the only land is the"
5303,CANTO XXXIV.,mountain of Purgatory. In changing one hemisphere for the other there
5304,CANTO XXXIV.,is a change of time of twelve hours. A second Saturday morning begins
5305,CANTO XXXIV.,"for the poets, and they pass nearly as long a time as they have been in"
5306,CANTO XXXIV.,"Hell, that is, twenty-four hours, in traversing the long and hard way"
5307,CANTO XXXIV.,that leads through the new hemisphere on which they have just entered.
5308,CANTO XXXIV.,
5309,CANTO XXXIV.,
5310,CANTO XXXIV.,"“Rise up,” said the Master, “on thy feet; the way is long and the road"
5311,CANTO XXXIV.,"is difficult, and already the sun unto mid-tierce[1] returns.”"
5312,CANTO XXXIV.,
5313,CANTO XXXIV.,"[2] Tierce is the church office sung at the third hour of the day, and"
5314,CANTO XXXIV.,the name is given to the first three hours after sunrise. Midtierce
5315,CANTO XXXIV.,consequently here means about half-past seven o’clock. In Hell Dante
5316,CANTO XXXIV.,"never mentions the sun to mark division of time, but now, having issued"
5317,CANTO XXXIV.,"from Hell, Virgil marks the hour by a reference to the sun."
5318,CANTO XXXIV.,
5319,CANTO XXXIV.,
5320,CANTO XXXIV.,"It was no hallway of a palace where we were, but a natural dungeon that"
5321,CANTO XXXIV.,"had a bad floor, and lack of light. “Before I tear me from the abyss,”"
5322,CANTO XXXIV.,"said I when I had risen up, “my Master, speak a little to me to draw me"
5323,CANTO XXXIV.,"out of error. Where is the ice? and this one, how is he fixed thus"
5324,CANTO XXXIV.,upside down? and how in such short while has the sun from eve to morn
5325,CANTO XXXIV.,"made transit?” And he to me, “Thou imaginest that thou still art on the"
5326,CANTO XXXIV.,other side of the centre where I laid hold on the hair of the guilty
5327,CANTO XXXIV.,Worm that pierces the world. On that side wast thou so long as I
5328,CANTO XXXIV.,descended; when I turned thou didst pass the point to which from all
5329,CANTO XXXIV.,parts whatever has weight is drawn; and thou art now arrived beneath
5330,CANTO XXXIV.,"the hemisphere opposite to that which the great dry land covers, and"
5331,CANTO XXXIV.,beneath whose zenith the Man was slain who was born and lived without
5332,CANTO XXXIV.,sin. Thou hast thy feet upon the little sphere which forms the other
5333,CANTO XXXIV.,face of the Judecca. Here it is morning when there it is evening; and
5334,CANTO XXXIV.,he who made for us a stairway with his hair is still fixed even as he
5335,CANTO XXXIV.,"was before. Upon this side he fell down from heaven, and the earth,"
5336,CANTO XXXIV.,"which before was spread out here, through fear of him made of the sea a"
5337,CANTO XXXIV.,"veil, and came to your hemisphere; and perchance to flee from him that"
5338,CANTO XXXIV.,land[1] which on this side appears left here this empty space and
5339,CANTO XXXIV.,upward ran back.”
5340,CANTO XXXIV.,
5341,CANTO XXXIV.,[1] The Mount of Purgatory.
5342,CANTO XXXIV.,
5343,CANTO XXXIV.,
5344,CANTO XXXIV.,"A place is there below, stretching as far from Beelzebub as his tomb"
5345,CANTO XXXIV.,"extends,[1] which not by sight is known, but by the sound of a rivulet"
5346,CANTO XXXIV.,that here descends along the hollow of a rock that it has gnawed with
5347,CANTO XXXIV.,its course that winds and little falls. My Leader and I entered through
5348,CANTO XXXIV.,"that hidden way, to return to the bright world. And without care, to"
5349,CANTO XXXIV.,"have any repose, we mounted up, he first and I second, till through a"
5350,CANTO XXXIV.,"round opening I saw of those beauteous things which heaven bears, and"
5351,CANTO XXXIV.,thence we came forth to see again the stars.
5352,CANTO XXXIV.,
5353,CANTO XXXIV.,[1] Hell is his tomb; this vacant dark passage through the opposite
5354,CANTO XXXIV.,"hemisphere is, of course, of the same depth as Hell from surface to"
