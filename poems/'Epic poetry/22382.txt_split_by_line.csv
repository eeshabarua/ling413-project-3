26,PREFACE.,
27,PREFACE.,"The present translation of the Iliad will, it is hoped, be found to"
28,PREFACE.,"convey, more accurately than any which has preceded it, the words and"
29,PREFACE.,thoughts of the original. It is based upon a careful examination of
30,PREFACE.,whatever has been contributed by scholars of every age towards the
31,PREFACE.,"elucidation of the text, including the ancient scholiasts and"
32,PREFACE.,"lexicographers, the exegetical labours of Barnes and Clarke, and the"
33,PREFACE.,"elaborate criticisms of Heyne, Wolf, and their successors."
34,PREFACE.,
35,PREFACE.,The necessary brevity of the notes has prevented the full discussion of
36,PREFACE.,"many passages where there is great room for difference of opinion, and"
37,PREFACE.,"hence several interpretations are adopted without question, which, had"
38,PREFACE.,"the editor’s object been to write a critical commentary, would have"
39,PREFACE.,undergone a more lengthened examination. The same reason has compelled
40,PREFACE.,"him, in many instances, to substitute references for extracts,"
41,PREFACE.,"indicating rather than quoting those storehouses of information, from"
42,PREFACE.,whose abundant contents he would gladly have drawn more copious
43,PREFACE.,"supplies. Among the numerous works to which he has had recourse, the"
44,PREFACE.,following deserve particular mention-Alberti’s invaluable edition of
45,PREFACE.,"Hesychius, the Commentary of Eustathius, and Buttmann’s Lexilogus."
46,PREFACE.,
47,PREFACE.,"In the succeeding volume, the Odyssey, Hymns, and minor poems will be"
48,PREFACE.,produced in a similar manner.

65,ARGUMENT.,
66,ARGUMENT.,"Apollo, enraged at the insult offered to his priest, Chryses, sends a"
67,ARGUMENT.,"pestilence upon the Greeks. A council is called, and Agamemnon, being"
68,ARGUMENT.,"compelled to restore the daughter of Chryses, whom he had taken from"
69,ARGUMENT.,"him, in revenge deprives Achilles of Hippodameia. Achilles resigns her,"
70,ARGUMENT.,"but refuses to aid the Greeks in battle, and at his request, his"
71,ARGUMENT.,"mother, Thetis, petitions Jove to honour her offended son at the"
72,ARGUMENT.,"expense of the Greeks. Jupiter, despite the opposition of Juno, grants"
73,ARGUMENT.,her request.
74,ARGUMENT.,
75,ARGUMENT.,
76,ARGUMENT.,"Sing, Ο goddess, the destructive wrath of Achilles, son of Peleus,"
77,ARGUMENT.,"which brought countless woes upon the Greeks, 1 and hurled many valiant"
78,ARGUMENT.,"souls of heroes down to Hades, and made themselves 2 a prey to dogs and"
79,ARGUMENT.,"to all birds [but the will of Jove was being accomplished], from the"
80,ARGUMENT.,"time when Atrides, king of men, and noble Achilles, first contending,"
81,ARGUMENT.,were disunited.
82,ARGUMENT.,
83,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 1: (return)  Although, as Ernesti observes, the verb προίαψεν"
84,ARGUMENT.,"does not necessarily contain the idea of a _premature_ death, yet the"
85,ARGUMENT.,ancient interpreters are almost unanimous in understanding it so. Thus
86,ARGUMENT.,"Eustathius, p. 13, ed. Bas.: μετὰ βλάζης είς Αιδην πρὁ το δέοντος"
87,ARGUMENT.,"ἔπεμφεν, ὡς τῆς προθέσεως (_i.e._ προ) καιρικόν τι δηλούσης, ἢ ἁπλὡς"
88,ARGUMENT.,"ἔπεμψεν, ώς πλεοναζούσης τἤς προθέσεως. Hesych. t. ii. p. 1029, s. ν.:"
89,ARGUMENT.,προίαψεν—δηλοῖ δε διὰ τἤς λέξεως τὴν μετ’ ỏδὑνης αὐτῶν ἀπώλειαν. Cf.
90,ARGUMENT.,"Virg. Æn. xii. 952: “Vitaque cum gemitu fugit _indignata_ sub umbras,”"
91,ARGUMENT.,"where Servius well observes, “quia discedebat a juvene: nam volunt"
92,ARGUMENT.,"philosophi, invitam animam discedere a corpore, cum quo adhuc habitare"
93,ARGUMENT.,"legibus naturæ poterat.” I have, however, followed Ernesti, with the"
94,ARGUMENT.,later commentators.
95,ARGUMENT.,
96,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 2: (return)  _I.e._ their bodies. Cf. Æ. i. 44, vi. 362, where"
97,ARGUMENT.,there is a similar sense of the pronoun.
98,ARGUMENT.,
99,ARGUMENT.,"Which, then, of the gods, engaged these two in strife, so that they"
100,ARGUMENT.,"should fight? 3 The son of Latona and Jove; for he, enraged with the"
101,ARGUMENT.,"king, stirred up an evil pestilence through the army [and the people"
102,ARGUMENT.,kept perishing] 4; because the son of Atreus had dishonoured the priest
103,ARGUMENT.,Chryses: for he came to the swift ships of the Greeks to ransom his
104,ARGUMENT.,"daughter, and bringing invaluable ransoms, having in his hands the"
105,ARGUMENT.,fillets of far-darting Apollo on his golden sceptre. And he supplicated
106,ARGUMENT.,"all the Greeks, but chiefly the two sons of Atreus, the leaders of the"
107,ARGUMENT.,people:
108,ARGUMENT.,
109,ARGUMENT.,"“Ye sons of Atreus, and ye other well-greaved Greeks, to you indeed may"
110,ARGUMENT.,"the gods, possessing the heavenly dwellings, grant to destroy the city"
111,ARGUMENT.,"of Priam, and to return home safely: but for me, liberate my beloved"
112,ARGUMENT.,"daughter, and accept the ransoms, reverencing the son of Jove,"
113,ARGUMENT.,far-darting Apollo.”
114,ARGUMENT.,
115,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 3: (return)  Rut see Anthon.
116,ARGUMENT.,
117,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 4: (return)  Observe the full force of the imperfect tense.
118,ARGUMENT.,
119,ARGUMENT.,"Upon this, all the other Greeks shouted assent, that the priest should"
120,ARGUMENT.,"be reverenced, and the splendid ransoms accepted; yet was it not"
121,ARGUMENT.,"pleasing in his mind to Agamemnon, son of Atreus; but he dismissed him"
122,ARGUMENT.,"evilly, and added a harsh mandate:"
123,ARGUMENT.,
124,ARGUMENT.,"“Let me not find thee, old man, at the hollow barks, either now"
125,ARGUMENT.,"loitering, or hereafter returning, lest the staff and fillet of the god"
126,ARGUMENT.,avail thee not. 5 For her I will not set free; sooner shall old age
127,ARGUMENT.,"come upon her, at home in Argos, far away from her native land,"
128,ARGUMENT.,"employed in offices of the loom, and preparing 6 my bed. But away!"
129,ARGUMENT.,"irritate me not, that thou mayest return the safer.”"
130,ARGUMENT.,
131,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 5: (return)  Of χραισμεῖν, Buttmann, Lexil. p. 546, observes"
132,ARGUMENT.,"that “it is never found in a positive sense, but remained in ancient"
133,ARGUMENT.,"usage in negative sentences only; as, ‘_it is of no use to thee_,’ or,"
134,ARGUMENT.,"‘_it helps thee not_,’ and similar expressions.”"
135,ARGUMENT.,
136,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 6: (return)  The old mistake of construing ἀντιόωσαν
137,ARGUMENT.,"“sharing,” which still clings to the translations, is exploded by"
138,ARGUMENT.,Buttm. Lex. p. 144. Eust. and Heysch. both give εὺτρεπίζονσαν as one of
139,ARGUMENT.,the interpretations; and that such is the right one is evident from the
140,ARGUMENT.,collateral phrase πορσύνειν λέχος in Od. iii. 403. Λμφιζέζηκας is the
141,ARGUMENT.,"perfect tense, but with the force of the present."
142,ARGUMENT.,
143,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but the old man was afraid, and obeyed the command. And"
144,ARGUMENT.,he went in silence along the shore of the loud-resounding sea; but
145,ARGUMENT.,"then, going apart, the aged man prayed much to king Apollo, whom"
146,ARGUMENT.,fair-haired Latona bore:
147,ARGUMENT.,
148,ARGUMENT.,"“Hear me, god of the silver bow, who art wont to protect Chrysa and"
149,ARGUMENT.,"divine Cilla, and who mightily rulest over Tenedos: O Sminthius, 7 if"
150,ARGUMENT.,"ever I have roofed 8 thy graceful temple, or if, moreover, at any time"
151,ARGUMENT.,"I have burned to thee the fat thighs of bulls or of goats, accomplish"
152,ARGUMENT.,"this entreaty for me. Let the Greeks pay for my tears, by thy arrows.”"
153,ARGUMENT.,
154,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 7: (return)  An epithet derived from σμίνθος, the Phrygian"
155,ARGUMENT.,name for a _mouse_: either because Apollo had put an end to a plague of
156,ARGUMENT.,"mice among that people, or because a mouse was thought emblematical of"
157,ARGUMENT.,"augury.—Grote, Hist. of Greece, vol. i. p. 68, observes that this"
158,ARGUMENT.,"“worship of Sminthian Apollo, in various parts of the Troad and its"
159,ARGUMENT.,"neighbouring territory, dates before the earliest period of Æolic"
160,ARGUMENT.,"colonization.” On the Homeric description of Apollo, see Müller,"
161,ARGUMENT.,"Dorians, vol. i. p. 315."
162,ARGUMENT.,
163,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 8: (return)  Not “crowned,” as Heyne says; for this was a"
164,ARGUMENT.,later custom.—See Anthon and Arnold.
165,ARGUMENT.,
166,ARGUMENT.,Thus he spoke praying; but to him Phoebus Apollo hearkened. And he
167,ARGUMENT.,"descended from the summits of Olympus, enraged in heart, having upon"
168,ARGUMENT.,"his shoulders his bow and quiver covered on all sides. But as he moved,"
169,ARGUMENT.,the shafts rattled forthwith 9 upon the shoulders of him enraged; but
170,ARGUMENT.,he went along like unto the night. Then he sat down apart from the
171,ARGUMENT.,"ships, and sent among them an arrow, and terrible arose the clang of"
172,ARGUMENT.,"the silver bow. First he attacked the mules, and the swift 10 dogs; but"
173,ARGUMENT.,"afterwards despatching a pointed arrow against [the Greeks] themselves,"
174,ARGUMENT.,"he smote them, and frequent funeral-piles of the dead were continually"
175,ARGUMENT.,burning. Nine days through the army went the arrows of the god; but on
176,ARGUMENT.,"the tenth, Achilles called the people to an assembly; for to his mind"
177,ARGUMENT.,the white-armed goddess Juno had suggested it; for she was anxious
178,ARGUMENT.,"concerning the Greeks, because she saw them perishing. But when they"
179,ARGUMENT.,"accordingly were assembled, and were met together, swift-footed"
180,ARGUMENT.,"Achilles, rising up amidst them, [thus] spoke:"
181,ARGUMENT.,
182,ARGUMENT.,"“O son of Atreus! now do I think that we would consent to return,"
183,ARGUMENT.,"having been defeated in our purpose, if we should but escape death,"
184,ARGUMENT.,since at the same time 11 war and pestilence subdue the Greeks. But
185,ARGUMENT.,"come now, let us consult some prophet, or priest, or even one who is"
186,ARGUMENT.,"informed by dreams (for dream also is from Jove), 12 who would tell us"
187,ARGUMENT.,on what account Phoebus Apollo is so much enraged with us: whether he
188,ARGUMENT.,"blames us on account of a vow [unperformed], or a hecatomb [unoffered];"
189,ARGUMENT.,"and whether haply he may be willing, having partaken of the savour of"
190,ARGUMENT.,"lambs and unblemished goats, to avert from us the pestilence.”"
191,ARGUMENT.,
192,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 9: (return)  The force of ἄρα is noticed by Nägelsbach.
193,ARGUMENT.,
194,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 10: (return)  Or “white.” Hesych. ταχεῖς, λευκούς."
195,ARGUMENT.,
196,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 11: (return)  Ammonius, p. 14, foolishly supposes that ἁμοῦ"
197,ARGUMENT.,"here denotes place, ἰν Τροίᾳ. Valcknaer justly supports the ordinary"
198,ARGUMENT.,interpretation.
199,ARGUMENT.,
200,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 12: (return)  Cf. Plin. Ep. i. 18, and Duport, Gnom. Hom. p."
201,ARGUMENT.,"3, sq."
202,ARGUMENT.,
203,ARGUMENT.,"He indeed, thus having spoken, sat down; but to them there arose by far"
204,ARGUMENT.,"the best of augurs, Calchas, son of Thestor, who knew the present, the"
205,ARGUMENT.,"future, and the past, 13 and who guided the ships of the Greeks to"
206,ARGUMENT.,"Ilium, by his prophetic art, which Phoebus Apollo gave him, who, being"
207,ARGUMENT.,"well disposed, 14 addressed them, and said:"
208,ARGUMENT.,
209,ARGUMENT.,"“O Achilles, dear to Jove, thou biddest me to declare the wrath of"
210,ARGUMENT.,"Apollo, the far-darting king. Therefore will I declare it; but do thou"
211,ARGUMENT.,"on thy part covenant, and swear to me, that thou wilt promptly assist"
212,ARGUMENT.,me in word and hand. For methinks I shall irritate a man who widely
213,ARGUMENT.,"rules over all the Argives, and whom the Greeks obey. For a king is"
214,ARGUMENT.,more powerful 15 when he is enraged with an inferior man; for though he
215,ARGUMENT.,"may repress his wrath 16 for that same day, yet he afterwards retains"
216,ARGUMENT.,"his anger in his heart, until he accomplishes it; but do thou consider"
217,ARGUMENT.,whether thou wilt protect me.”
218,ARGUMENT.,
219,ARGUMENT.,"But him swift-footed Achilles, answering, addressed: “Taking full"
220,ARGUMENT.,"confidence, declare the divine oracle, whatsoever thou knowest. For, by"
221,ARGUMENT.,"Apollo, dear to Jove, to whom thou, praying, O Calchas, dost disclose"
222,ARGUMENT.,"predictions to the Greeks, no one of all the Greeks, while I am alive"
223,ARGUMENT.,"and have sight upon the earth, shall lay heavy hands upon thee at the"
224,ARGUMENT.,"hollow ships; not even if thou wast to name Agamemnon, who now boasts"
225,ARGUMENT.,himself to be much the most powerful of the Greeks.” 17
226,ARGUMENT.,
227,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 13: (return)  A common formula in the ancient poets to express
228,ARGUMENT.,the eternity of things. Empedocles apud Pseud. Arist. de Mundo: άνθ’

237,ARGUMENT.,
238,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 16: (return)  Lit. “digest his bile”. Homer’s distinction
239,ARGUMENT.,"between χόλος and κότος is observed by Nemesius, de Nat. Hom. § 21."
240,ARGUMENT.,
241,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 17: (return)  I have used “Greeks” wherever the whole army is
242,ARGUMENT.,evidently meant. In other instances I have retained the specific names
243,ARGUMENT.,of the different confederate nations.
244,ARGUMENT.,
245,ARGUMENT.,"And upon this, the blameless prophet then took confidence, and spoke:"
246,ARGUMENT.,"“Neither is he enraged on account of a vow [unperformed], nor of a"
247,ARGUMENT.,"hecatomb [unoffered], but on account of his priest, whom Agamemnon"
248,ARGUMENT.,"dishonoured; neither did he liberate his daughter, nor did he receive"
249,ARGUMENT.,"her ransom. Wherefore has the Far-darter given woes, and still will he"
250,ARGUMENT.,"give them; nor will he withhold his heavy hands from the pestilence,"
251,ARGUMENT.,before that [Agamemnon] restore to her dear father the bright-eyed 18
252,ARGUMENT.,"maid, unpurchased, unransomed, and conduct a sacred hecatomb to Chrysa;"
253,ARGUMENT.,"then, perhaps, having appeased, we might persuade him.”"
254,ARGUMENT.,
255,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 18: (return)  See Arnold.
256,ARGUMENT.,
257,ARGUMENT.,"He indeed, having thus spoken, sat down. But to them arose the hero,"
258,ARGUMENT.,"the son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon, 19 agitated; and his"
259,ARGUMENT.,"all-gloomy heart was greatly filled with wrath, and his eyes were like"
260,ARGUMENT.,"unto gleaming fire. Sternly regarding Calchas most of all, he addressed"
261,ARGUMENT.,[him]:
262,ARGUMENT.,
263,ARGUMENT.,"“Prophet of ills, not at any time hast thou spoken anything good for"
264,ARGUMENT.,"me; but evils are always gratifying to thy soul to prophesy, 20 and"
265,ARGUMENT.,"never yet hast thou offered one good word, nor accomplished [one]. And"
266,ARGUMENT.,"now, prophesying amongst the Greeks, thou haranguest that forsooth the"
267,ARGUMENT.,"Far-darter works griefs to them upon this account, because I was"
268,ARGUMENT.,unwilling to accept the splendid ransom of the virgin daughter of
269,ARGUMENT.,"Chryses, since I much prefer to have her at home; and my reason is, I"
270,ARGUMENT.,"prefer her even to Clytemnestra, my lawful wife; for she is not"
271,ARGUMENT.,"inferior to her, either in person, or in figure, or in mind, or by any"
272,ARGUMENT.,"means in accomplishments. But even thus I am willing to restore her, if"
273,ARGUMENT.,it be better; for I wish the people to be safe rather than to perish.
274,ARGUMENT.,"But do thou immediately prepare a prize for me, that I may not alone,"
275,ARGUMENT.,"of the Argives, be without a prize; since it is not fitting. For ye all"
276,ARGUMENT.,"see this, that my prize is going elsewhere.”"
277,ARGUMENT.,
278,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 19: (return)  “In the assembly of the people, as in the courts"
279,ARGUMENT.,"of justice, the nobles alone speak, advise, and decide, whilst the"
280,ARGUMENT.,"people merely listen to their ordinances and decisions, in order to"
281,ARGUMENT.,"regulate their own conduct accordingly; being suffered, indeed, to"
282,ARGUMENT.,"follow the natural impulse of evincing, to a certain extent, their"
283,ARGUMENT.,"approbation or disapprobation of their superiors, but without any legal"
284,ARGUMENT.,"means of giving validity to their opinion.” Müller, Gk. Lit. p. 30."
285,ARGUMENT.,
286,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 20: (return)  But we must not join μαντεύεσθαι with
287,ARGUMENT.,κικά.—Nägelsbach.
288,ARGUMENT.,
289,ARGUMENT.,But him swift-footed godlike Achilles then answered: “Most noble son of
290,ARGUMENT.,"Atreus, most avaricious of all! for how shall the magnanimous Greeks"
291,ARGUMENT.,assign thee a prize? Nor do we know of many common stores laid up
292,ARGUMENT.,"anywhere. But what we plundered 21 from the cities, these have been"
293,ARGUMENT.,"divided, and it is not fitting that the troops should collect these"
294,ARGUMENT.,"brought together again. But do thou now let her go to the God, and we"
295,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks will compensate thee thrice, or four-fold, if haply Jove grant"
296,ARGUMENT.,to us to sack the well-fortified city of Troy.”
297,ARGUMENT.,
298,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 21: (return)  More closely: “took from the cities, when we"
299,ARGUMENT.,destroyed them.”
300,ARGUMENT.,
301,ARGUMENT.,"But him answering, king Agamemnon addressed: “Do not thus, excellent"
302,ARGUMENT.,"though thou be, godlike Achilles, practise deceit in thy mind; since"
303,ARGUMENT.,"thou shalt not overreach, nor yet persuade me. Dost thou wish that thou"
304,ARGUMENT.,"thyself mayest have a prize, whilst I sit down idly, 22 wanting one?"
305,ARGUMENT.,"And dost thou bid me to restore her? If, however, the magnanimous"
306,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks will give me a prize, having suited it to my mind, so that it"
307,ARGUMENT.,"shall be an equivalent, [it is well]. But if they will not give it,"
308,ARGUMENT.,"then I myself coming, will seize your prize, or that of Ajax, 23 or"
309,ARGUMENT.,"Ulysses, 24 and will bear it away; and he to whom I may come shall have"
310,ARGUMENT.,"cause for anger. On these things, however, we will consult afterwards."
311,ARGUMENT.,"But now come, let us launch a sable ship into the boundless sea, and"
312,ARGUMENT.,"let us collect into it rowers in sufficient number, and place on board"
313,ARGUMENT.,a hecatomb; and let us make the fair-cheeked daughter of Chryses to
314,ARGUMENT.,"embark, and let some one noble man be commander, Ajax or Idomeneus, or"
315,ARGUMENT.,"divine Ulysses; or thyself, son of Peleus, most terrible of all men,"
316,ARGUMENT.,"that thou mayest appease for us the Far-darter, having offered"
317,ARGUMENT.,sacrifices.”

322,ARGUMENT.,
323,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 24: (return)  Laodice, daughter of Cyenus."
324,ARGUMENT.,
325,ARGUMENT.,"But him swift-footed Achilles sternly regarding, addressed: “Ha! 25"
326,ARGUMENT.,"thou clad in impudence, thou bent on gain, how can any of the Greeks"
327,ARGUMENT.,"willingly obey thy orders, either to undertake a mission, or to fight"
328,ARGUMENT.,bravely with men? For I did not come hither to fight on account of the
329,ARGUMENT.,"warlike Trojans, seeing that they are blameless as respects me. Since"
330,ARGUMENT.,"they have never driven away my oxen, nor my horses either nor ever"
331,ARGUMENT.,injured my crops in fertile and populous Phthia: for very many shadowy
332,ARGUMENT.,"mountains, and the resounding sea, are between us. But thee, O most"
333,ARGUMENT.,"shameless man, we follow, that thou mayest rejoice; seeking"
334,ARGUMENT.,"satisfaction from the Trojans for Menelaus, and for thy pleasure,"
335,ARGUMENT.,shameless one! for which things thou hast neither respect nor care. And
336,ARGUMENT.,now thou hast threatened that thou wilt in person wrest from me my
337,ARGUMENT.,"prize, for which I have toiled much, and which the sons of the Greeks"
338,ARGUMENT.,have given me. Whenever the Greeks sacked a well-inhabited city of the
339,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans, I never have had a prize equal to thine; although my hands"
340,ARGUMENT.,"perform the greater portion of the tumultuous conflict, yet when the"
341,ARGUMENT.,"division [of spoil] may come, a much greater prize is given to thee,"
342,ARGUMENT.,"while I come to my ships, when I am fatigued with fighting, having one"
343,ARGUMENT.,"small and agreeable. But now I will go to Phthia, for it is much better"
344,ARGUMENT.,to return home with our curved ships; for I do not think that thou
345,ARGUMENT.,shalt amass wealth and treasures while I am dishonoured here.”
346,ARGUMENT.,
347,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 25: (return)  See my note on Od. i. p. 2, n. 11, ed. Bohn."
348,ARGUMENT.,
349,ARGUMENT.,"But him, the king of men, Agamemnon, then answered: “Fly, by all means,"
350,ARGUMENT.,if thy mind urges thee; nor will I entreat thee to remain on my
351,ARGUMENT.,"account: there are others with me who will honour me, but chiefly the"
352,ARGUMENT.,all-wise Jove. For to me thou art the most odious of the Jove-nourished
353,ARGUMENT.,"princes, for ever is contention agreeable to thee, and wars and"
354,ARGUMENT.,"battles. If thou be very bold, why doubtless a deity has given this to"
355,ARGUMENT.,"thee. Going home with thy ships and thy companions, rule over the"
356,ARGUMENT.,"Myrmidons; for I do not regard thee, nor care for thee in thy wrath;"
357,ARGUMENT.,but thus will I threaten thee: Since Phoebus Apollo is depriving me of
358,ARGUMENT.,"the daughter of Chryses, 26 her indeed I will send, with my own ship,"
359,ARGUMENT.,"and with my own friends; but I myself, going to thy tent, will lead"
360,ARGUMENT.,"away the fair-cheeked daughter of Brises, 27 thy prize; that thou"
361,ARGUMENT.,"mayest well know how much more powerful I am than thou, and that"
362,ARGUMENT.,"another may dread to pronounce himself equal to me, and to liken"
363,ARGUMENT.,himself openly [to me].”

371,ARGUMENT.,"drawing his sharp sword from his thigh, he should dismiss them, 28 and"
372,ARGUMENT.,"should kill the son of Atreus, or should put a stop to his wrath, and"
373,ARGUMENT.,restrain his passion. While he was thus pondering in his heart and
374,ARGUMENT.,"soul, and was drawing his mighty sword from the scabbard, came Minerva"
375,ARGUMENT.,"from heaven; for her the white-armed goddess Juno had sent forward,"
376,ARGUMENT.,"equally loving and regarding both from her soul. And she stood behind,"
377,ARGUMENT.,"and caught the son of Peleus by his yellow hair, appearing to him"
378,ARGUMENT.,"alone; but none of the others beheld her. But Achilles was amazed, and"
379,ARGUMENT.,"turned himself round, and immediately recognized Pallas Minerva; and"
380,ARGUMENT.,"awe-inspiring her eyes appeared to him. And addressing her, he spoke"
381,ARGUMENT.,winged words:
382,ARGUMENT.,
383,ARGUMENT.,"“Why, O offspring of ægis-bearing Jove, hast thou come hither? Is it"
384,ARGUMENT.,"that thou mayest witness the insolence of Agamemnon, the son of Atreus?"
385,ARGUMENT.,"But I tell thee, what I think will be accomplished, that he will"
386,ARGUMENT.,probably soon lose his life by his haughtiness.”
387,ARGUMENT.,
388,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 28: (return)  The princes assembled.
389,ARGUMENT.,
390,ARGUMENT.,But him in turn the azure-eyed goddess Minerva addressed: “I came from
391,ARGUMENT.,"heaven to assuage thy wrath, if thou wilt obey me; for the white-armed"
392,ARGUMENT.,"goddess Juno sent me forward, equally loving and regarding both from"
393,ARGUMENT.,"her soul. But come, cease from strife, nor draw the sword with thine"
394,ARGUMENT.,"hand. But reproach by words, as the occasion may suggest; for thus I"
395,ARGUMENT.,"declare, and it shall be accomplished, that thrice as many splendid"
396,ARGUMENT.,"gifts shall be presented to thee, because of this insolent act; only"
397,ARGUMENT.,"restrain thyself, and obey us.”"
398,ARGUMENT.,
399,ARGUMENT.,"But her answering, 29 swift-footed Achilles addressed: “It behoves me"
400,ARGUMENT.,"to observe the command of you both, O goddess, although much enraged in"
401,ARGUMENT.,"my soul; for so it is better. Whosoever obeys the gods, to him they"
402,ARGUMENT.,hearken propitiously.”

404,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 29: (return)  Columna on Ennius, p. 17, ed. Hessel., compares"
405,ARGUMENT.,"“Ollei respondet Rex Albaï longaï,” and “Ollei respondet suavis sonus"
406,ARGUMENT.,"Egeriäi,” observing that this formula was probably as common in the"
407,ARGUMENT.,heroic annals of Ennius as τὸν δ’ ὰπαμειξόμενος is in Homer.
408,ARGUMENT.,
409,ARGUMENT.,"He spoke, and held still his heavy hand upon the silvery hilt, and"
410,ARGUMENT.,"thrust back the great sword into the scabbard, nor did he disobey the"
411,ARGUMENT.,"mandate of Minerva; but she had gone to Olympus, to the mansions of"
412,ARGUMENT.,"ægis-bearing Jove, amongst the other deities. But the son of Peleus"
413,ARGUMENT.,"again addressed Atrides with injurious 30 words, nor as yet ceased from"
414,ARGUMENT.,anger:
415,ARGUMENT.,
416,ARGUMENT.,"“Wine-bibber, having the countenance of a dog, but the heart of a stag,"
417,ARGUMENT.,never hast thou at any time dared in soul to arm thyself with the
418,ARGUMENT.,"people for war, nor to go to ambuscade with the chiefs of the Greeks;"
419,ARGUMENT.,for this always appears to thee to be death. Certainly it is much
420,ARGUMENT.,"better through the wide army of the Achæans, to take away the rewards"
421,ARGUMENT.,"of whoever may speak against thee. A people-devouring king [art thou],"
422,ARGUMENT.,"since thou rulest over fellows of no account; for assuredly, son of"
423,ARGUMENT.,"Atreus, thou [otherwise] wouldst have insulted now for the last time."
424,ARGUMENT.,"But I will tell thee, and I will further swear a great oath: yea, by"
425,ARGUMENT.,"this sceptre, which will never bear leaves and branches, nor will bud"
426,ARGUMENT.,"again, after it has once left its trunk on the mountains; for the axe"
427,ARGUMENT.,has lopped it all around of its leaves and bark; but now the sons of
428,ARGUMENT.,"the Greeks, the judges, they who protect the laws [received] from Jove,"
429,ARGUMENT.,bear it in their hands; and this will be a great oath to thee; surely
430,ARGUMENT.,will a longing desire for Achilles come upon all the sons of the
431,ARGUMENT.,"Achæans at some future day, and thou, although much grieved, wilt be"
432,ARGUMENT.,"unable to assist them, when many dying shall fall by the hand of"
433,ARGUMENT.,"man-slaying Hector. Then enraged, wilt thou inwardly fret thy soul,"
434,ARGUMENT.,that thou didst in no way honour the bravest of the Greeks.”

439,ARGUMENT.,
440,ARGUMENT.,Thus spoke the son of Peleus; and he cast upon the earth his sceptre
441,ARGUMENT.,"studded with golden nails, and sat down. But on the other hand, the son"
442,ARGUMENT.,"of Atreus was enraged; therefore to them arose the sweet-voiced Nestor,"
443,ARGUMENT.,"31 the harmonious orator of the Pylians, from whose tongue flowed"
444,ARGUMENT.,language sweeter than honey. During his life two generations of
445,ARGUMENT.,"articulately-speaking men had become extinct, who, formerly, were"
446,ARGUMENT.,"reared and lived with him in divine Pylus, but he was now ruling over"

455,ARGUMENT.,"greatly rejoice in their souls, if they were to hear these things of"
456,ARGUMENT.,you twain contending: you who in council and in fighting surpass the
457,ARGUMENT.,Greeks. But be persuaded; for ye are both younger than I am. For
458,ARGUMENT.,"already, in former times, I have associated with men braver than you,"
459,ARGUMENT.,"and they never disdained me. I never saw, nor shall I see, such men as"
460,ARGUMENT.,"Pirithous, and Dryas, shepherd of the people, and Cæneus, and Exadius,"
461,ARGUMENT.,"and god-like Polyphemus, 32 and Theseus, the son of Ægeus, like unto"
462,ARGUMENT.,the immortals. Bravest indeed were they trained up of earthly men;
463,ARGUMENT.,"bravest they were, and they fought with the bravest Centaurs of the"
464,ARGUMENT.,"mountain caves, and terribly slew them. With these was I conversant,"
465,ARGUMENT.,"coming from Pylus, far from the Apian land; for they invited me, and I"
466,ARGUMENT.,fought to the best of my power; but with them none of these who now are
467,ARGUMENT.,"mortals upon the earth could fight. And even they heard my counsels,"
468,ARGUMENT.,"and obeyed my words. But do ye also obey, since it is better to be"
469,ARGUMENT.,"obedient; nor do thou, although being powerful, take away the maid from"
470,ARGUMENT.,"him, but leave it so, seeing that the sons of the Greeks first gave"
471,ARGUMENT.,"[her as] a prize on him. Nor do thou, Ο son of Peleus, feel inclined to"
472,ARGUMENT.,"contend against the king; since never yet has any sceptre-bearing king,"
473,ARGUMENT.,"to whom Jove has given glory, been allotted an equal share of dignity."
474,ARGUMENT.,"But though thou be of superior strength, and a goddess mother has given"
475,ARGUMENT.,"thee birth, yet he is superior in power, inasmuch as he rules more"
476,ARGUMENT.,"people. Do thou, son of Atreus, repress thine anger; for it is I that"
477,ARGUMENT.,"33 entreat thee to forego thy resentment on behalf of Achilles, who is"
478,ARGUMENT.,the great bulwark of destructive war to all the Achæans.”

485,ARGUMENT.,But him king Agamemnon answering addressed: “Of a truth thou hast said
486,ARGUMENT.,"all these things, old man, according to what is right. But this man is"
487,ARGUMENT.,"desirous to be above all other men; he wishes to have the mastery, and"
488,ARGUMENT.,"lord it over all, and to prescribe to all; with which his desires I"
489,ARGUMENT.,think some one will not comply. But if the ever-existing gods have made
490,ARGUMENT.,"him a warrior, do they therefore give him the right to utter insults?”"
491,ARGUMENT.,
492,ARGUMENT.,"But him noble Achilles interruptingly answered: “Yea, forsooth, 34 I"
493,ARGUMENT.,"may be called a coward and a man of no worth, if now I yield to thee in"
494,ARGUMENT.,"everything, whatever thou mayest say. Enjoin these things to other men;"
495,ARGUMENT.,"for dictate not to me, for I think that I shall no longer obey thee."
496,ARGUMENT.,"But another thing will I tell thee, and do thou store it in thy mind: I"
497,ARGUMENT.,"will not contend with my hands, neither with thee, nor with others, on"
498,ARGUMENT.,"account of this maid, since ye, the donors, take her away. But of the"
499,ARGUMENT.,"other effects, which I have at my swift black ship, of those thou shalt"
500,ARGUMENT.,"not remove one, taking them away, I being unwilling. But if [thou"
501,ARGUMENT.,"wilt], come, make trial, that these also may know: quickly shall thy"
502,ARGUMENT.,black blood flow around my lance.”

506,ARGUMENT.,
507,ARGUMENT.,"Thus these twain, striving with contrary words, arose, and they broke"
508,ARGUMENT.,up the assembly at the ships of the Greeks. The son of Peleus on his
509,ARGUMENT.,"part repaired to his tents and well-proportioned 35 ships, with the son"
510,ARGUMENT.,"of Menoetius, 36 and his companions. But the son of Atreus 37 launched"
511,ARGUMENT.,"his swift ship into the sea, and selected and put into it twenty"
512,ARGUMENT.,"rowers, and embarked a hecatomb for the god. And he led the fair"
513,ARGUMENT.,"daughter of Chryses and placed her on board, and the very wise Ulysses"
514,ARGUMENT.,"embarked as conductor. They then embarking, sailed over the watery"
515,ARGUMENT.,paths. But the son of Atreus ordered the armies to purify themselves;
516,ARGUMENT.,"38 and they were purified, and cast forth the ablutions into the sea."
517,ARGUMENT.,"And they sacrificed to Apollo perfect hecatombs of bulls and goats,"
518,ARGUMENT.,along the shore of the barren sea; and the savour involved in 39 smoke
519,ARGUMENT.,ascended to heaven. Thus were they employed in these things through the
520,ARGUMENT.,army. Nor did Agamemnon cease from the contention which at first he
521,ARGUMENT.,threatened against Achilles. But he thus addressed Talthybius and

546,ARGUMENT.,be more grievous 41 to him.”
547,ARGUMENT.,
548,ARGUMENT.,"Thus speaking, he despatched them, having added 42 a harsh command. But"
549,ARGUMENT.,"they reluctantly went along the shore of the barren sea, and came to"
550,ARGUMENT.,the tents and ships of the Myrmidons. And they found him sitting at his
551,ARGUMENT.,"tent and his black ship: nor did Achilles, seeing them, rejoice. But"
552,ARGUMENT.,"they, confused, and reverencing the king, stood still, nor addressed"
553,ARGUMENT.,"him at all, nor spoke [their bidding]. But he perceived [it] in his"
554,ARGUMENT.,"mind, and said:"
555,ARGUMENT.,
556,ARGUMENT.,"“Hail, heralds, messengers of Jove, 43 and also of men, come near, for"
557,ARGUMENT.,"ye are not blamable to me in the least, but Agamemnon, who has sent you"
558,ARGUMENT.,"on account of the maid Brisëis. However, come, noble Patroclus, lead"
559,ARGUMENT.,"forth the maid, and give her to them to conduct; but let these be"
560,ARGUMENT.,"witnesses [of the insult offered me], both before the blessed gods, and"
561,ARGUMENT.,"before mortal men, and before the merciless king. But if ever again"
562,ARGUMENT.,"there shall be need of me to avert unseemly destruction from the rest,"
563,ARGUMENT.,"[appeal to me shall be in vain], 44 for surely he rages with an"
564,ARGUMENT.,"infatuated mind, nor knows at all how to view the future and the past,"
565,ARGUMENT.,in order that the Greeks may fight in safety at their ships.”
566,ARGUMENT.,
567,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke. And Patroclus obeyed his dear companion, and led forth"
568,ARGUMENT.,"fair-cheeked Brisëis from the tent, and gave her to them to conduct;"
569,ARGUMENT.,and they returned along by the ships of the Greeks. But the woman went
570,ARGUMENT.,"with them reluctantly, whilst Achilles, weeping, 45 immediately sat"
571,ARGUMENT.,"down, removed apart from his companions, upon the shore of the hoary"
572,ARGUMENT.,"sea, gazing on the darkling main; and much he be sought his dear"

595,ARGUMENT.,"my prize, possesses it, himself having wrested it [from me].”"
596,ARGUMENT.,
597,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke, weeping. But to him his venerable mother hearkened,"
598,ARGUMENT.,sitting in the depths of the ocean beside her aged sire. And
599,ARGUMENT.,"immediately she rose up from the hoary deep, like a mist. And then she"
600,ARGUMENT.,"sat before him weeping, and soothed him with her hand, and addressed"
601,ARGUMENT.,"him, and spoke aloud:"
602,ARGUMENT.,
603,ARGUMENT.,"“Son, why weepest thou—on account of what has grief come upon thy mind?"
604,ARGUMENT.,"Declare it, nor hide it in thy soul, that we both may know it.”"
605,ARGUMENT.,
606,ARGUMENT.,"But her, sighing deeply, swift-footed Achilles addressed: “Thou"

608,ARGUMENT.,"[them]? We went against Thebe, 46 the sacred city of Eëtion; and this"
609,ARGUMENT.,"we plundered, and brought hither all [the spoil]. And these things"
610,ARGUMENT.,"indeed the sons of the Greeks fairly divided among themselves, and"
611,ARGUMENT.,selected for Agamemnon the fair-cheeked daughter of Chryses. But
612,ARGUMENT.,"Chryses, priest of the far-darting Apollo, came afterwards to the fleet"
613,ARGUMENT.,"ships of the brazen-mailed Greeks, about to ransom his daughter, and"
614,ARGUMENT.,"bringing invaluable ransoms, having in his hand the fillets of"
615,ARGUMENT.,"far-darting Apollo, on his golden sceptre. And he supplicated all the"
616,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks, but chiefly the two sons of Atreus, the leaders of the people."
617,ARGUMENT.,"Upon this all the other Greeks shouted assent, that the priest should"
618,ARGUMENT.,"be reverenced, and the splendid ransoms accepted: yet it was not"
619,ARGUMENT.,"pleasing to Agamemnon, son of Atreus, in his mind; but he dismissed him"
620,ARGUMENT.,"evilly, and added a harsh mandate. The old man therefore went back"
621,ARGUMENT.,"enraged; but Apollo hearkened to him praying, for he was very dear to"
622,ARGUMENT.,him. And he sent a destructive arrow against the Greeks; and the forces
623,ARGUMENT.,"were now dying one upon another, and the shafts of the god went on all"
624,ARGUMENT.,sides through the wide army of the Greeks. But to us the skilful seer
625,ARGUMENT.,unfolded the divine will of the Far-darter. Straightway I first
626,ARGUMENT.,exhorted that we should appease the god; but then rage seized upon the
627,ARGUMENT.,"son of Atreus, and instantly rising, he uttered a threatening speech,"
628,ARGUMENT.,which is now accomplished; for the rolling-eyed Greeks attend her to
629,ARGUMENT.,"Chrysa with a swift bark, and bring presents to the king; but the"
630,ARGUMENT.,"heralds have just now gone from my tent, conducting the virgin daughter"
631,ARGUMENT.,"of Brisëis, whom the sons of the Greeks gave to me. But do thou, if"
632,ARGUMENT.,"thou art able, aid thy son. Going to Olympus, supplicate Jove, if ever"
633,ARGUMENT.,"thou didst delight the heart of Jove as to anything, by word or deed;"
634,ARGUMENT.,"for I frequently heard thee boasting in the palaces of my sire, when"
635,ARGUMENT.,"thou saidest that thou alone, amongst the immortals, didst avert"
636,ARGUMENT.,"unworthy destruction from the cloud-collecting son of Saturn, when the"
637,ARGUMENT.,"other Olympian inhabitants, Juno, and Neptune, and Pallas Minerva,"
638,ARGUMENT.,"wished to bind him. But thou, O goddess, having approached, freed him"
639,ARGUMENT.,"from his chains, having quickly summoned to lofty Olympus, the"
640,ARGUMENT.,"hundred-handed, whom the gods call Briareus, and all men Ægeon, because"
641,ARGUMENT.,"he was superior to his father in strength, 47 who then sat by the son"
642,ARGUMENT.,"of Saturn, exulting in renown. Him then the blessed gods dreaded, nor"
643,ARGUMENT.,"did they bind [Jove]. Of these things now reminding him, sit beside"
644,ARGUMENT.,"him, and embrace his knees, if in anywise he may consent to aid the"
645,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans, and hem in 48 at their ships, and along the sea, the Greeks"
646,ARGUMENT.,"[while they get] slaughtered, that all may enjoy their king, and that"

686,ARGUMENT.,"hecatomb. But they, when they had entered the deep haven, first furled"
687,ARGUMENT.,"their sails, and stowed them in the sable bark; they next brought the"

692,ARGUMENT.,"Apollo, and then they made the daughter of Chryses descend from the"
693,ARGUMENT.,"sea-traversing bark. Then wise Ulysses, leading her to the altar,"

720,ARGUMENT.,
721,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke praying, and him Phœbus Apollo heard. But after they had"
722,ARGUMENT.,"prayed, and sprinkled the pounded barley, they first bent back [the"
723,ARGUMENT.,"neck of the victims], killed them, and flayed them, and cut out the"
724,ARGUMENT.,"thighs, and wrapped them round with the fat, having arranged it in"
725,ARGUMENT.,double folds; then laid the raw flesh upon them. Then the old man
726,ARGUMENT.,"burned them on billets, and poured sparkling wine upon them; and near"
727,ARGUMENT.,him the youths held five-pronged spits in their hands. But after the
728,ARGUMENT.,"thighs were roasted, and they had tasted the entrails, they then cut"
729,ARGUMENT.,"the rest of them into small pieces, and fixed them on spits, and"
730,ARGUMENT.,"roasted them skilfully, and drew all the viands [off the spits]."
731,ARGUMENT.,
732,ARGUMENT.,"But when they had ceased from their labour, and had prepared the"
733,ARGUMENT.,"banquet, they feasted; nor did their soul in anywise lack a due"
734,ARGUMENT.,allowance of the feast: but when they had dismissed the desire of drink
735,ARGUMENT.,"and food, the youths on the one hand filled the goblets with wine to"
736,ARGUMENT.,"the brim, 52 and handed round the wine to all, having poured the first"
737,ARGUMENT.,of the wine into the cups. 53 But the Grecian youths throughout the day
738,ARGUMENT.,"were appeasing the god by song, chanting the joyous Pæan, 54 hymning"
739,ARGUMENT.,"the Far-darter, and he was delighted in his mind as he listened. But"
740,ARGUMENT.,"when the sun had set, and darkness came on, then they slept near the"
741,ARGUMENT.,"hawsers of their ships. But when the mother of dawn, 55 rosy-fingered"
742,ARGUMENT.,"morning, appeared, straightway then they set sail for the spacious camp"
743,ARGUMENT.,"of the Achæans, and to them far-darting Apollo sent a favourable gale."
744,ARGUMENT.,But they erected the mast and expanded the white sails. The wind
745,ARGUMENT.,"streamed 56 into the bosom of the sail; and as the vessel briskly ran,"
746,ARGUMENT.,the dark wave roared loudly around the keel; but she scudded through
747,ARGUMENT.,"the wave, holding on her way. But when they reached the wide armament"
748,ARGUMENT.,"of the Greeks, they drew up the black ship on the continent, far upon"
749,ARGUMENT.,"the sand, and stretched long props under it; but they dispersed"
750,ARGUMENT.,themselves through their tents and ships.

767,ARGUMENT.,"But the Jove-sprung son of Peleus, swift-footed Achilles, continued his"
768,ARGUMENT.,"wrath, sitting at his swift ships, nor ever did he frequent the"
769,ARGUMENT.,"assembly of noble heroes, nor the fight, but he pined away his dear"
770,ARGUMENT.,"heart, remaining there, although he longed for the din and the battle."
771,ARGUMENT.,
772,ARGUMENT.,"Now when the twelfth morning from that time arose, 57 then indeed all"
773,ARGUMENT.,"the gods who are for ever went together to Olympus, but Jupiter"
774,ARGUMENT.,"preceded. But Thetis was not forgetful of the charges of her son, but"
775,ARGUMENT.,"she emerged from the wave of the sea, and at dawn ascended lofty heaven"
776,ARGUMENT.,and Olympus; 58 and she found the far-seeing son of Saturn sitting
777,ARGUMENT.,"apart from the others, on the highest summit of many-peaked Olympus,"
778,ARGUMENT.,"and then she sat down before him, and embraced his knees with her left"
779,ARGUMENT.,"hand, but with the right taking him by the chin, imploring, she thus"
780,ARGUMENT.,"addressed king Jove, the son of Saturn:"
781,ARGUMENT.,
782,ARGUMENT.,"“O father Jove, if ever I have aided thee among the immortals, either"
783,ARGUMENT.,"in word or deed, accomplish for me this desire: honour my son, who is"
784,ARGUMENT.,"the most short-lived of others; for now indeed Agamemnon, the king of"
785,ARGUMENT.,"men, has disgraced him; for he possesses his prize, he himself having"
786,ARGUMENT.,"borne it away. Do thou at least, Olympian Jove all counselling, honour"
787,ARGUMENT.,"him: and so long grant victory to the Trojans, until the Greeks shall"
788,ARGUMENT.,"reverence my son, and shall advance him in honour.”"

795,ARGUMENT.,"Thus she spoke; but cloud-compelling Jove answered her nothing, but sat"
796,ARGUMENT.,"silent for a long time. And as Thetis seized his knees, fast clinging"
797,ARGUMENT.,"she held them, and thus again entreated: “Do but now promise to me"
798,ARGUMENT.,"explicitly, and grant or refuse, (for in thee there is no dread,) that"
799,ARGUMENT.,I may well know how far I am the most dishonoured goddess amongst all.”
800,ARGUMENT.,
801,ARGUMENT.,"But her cloud-compelling Jove, deeply moved, addressed: “Truly now this"
802,ARGUMENT.,"[will be] a grievous matter, since thou wilt cause me to give offence"
803,ARGUMENT.,"to Juno, when she shall irritate me with reproachful words. For, even"
804,ARGUMENT.,"without reason, she is perpetually chiding me amongst the immortal"
805,ARGUMENT.,"gods, and also says that I aid the Trojans in battle. But do thou on"
806,ARGUMENT.,"thy part now depart, lest Juno behold thee: but these things shall be"
807,ARGUMENT.,"my care, until I perform them. But if [thou wilt have it thus], so be"
808,ARGUMENT.,"it; I will nod to thee with my head, that thou mayest feel confidence."
809,ARGUMENT.,For this from me is the greatest pledge among the immortals: for my
810,ARGUMENT.,"pledge, even whatsoever I shall sanction by nod, is not to be"
811,ARGUMENT.,"retracted, neither fallacious nor unfulfilled.”"
812,ARGUMENT.,
813,ARGUMENT.,"The son of Saturn spoke, and nodded thereupon with his dark eyebrows."
814,ARGUMENT.,And then the ambrosial locks of the king were shaken over him from his
815,ARGUMENT.,immortal head; and he made mighty Olympus tremble. Thus having
816,ARGUMENT.,"conferred, they separated. She at once plunged from splendid Olympus"
817,ARGUMENT.,into the profound sea. But Jove on the other hand [returned] to his
818,ARGUMENT.,palace. But all the gods rose up together from their seats to meet
819,ARGUMENT.,"their sire; nor did any dare to await 59 him approaching, but all rose"
820,ARGUMENT.,in his presence. Thus indeed he sat there on his throne; nor was Juno
821,ARGUMENT.,"unconscious, having seen that silver-footed Thetis, the daughter of the"
822,ARGUMENT.,"marine old man, had joined in deliberation with him. Forthwith with"
823,ARGUMENT.,reproaches she accosted Saturnian Jove:
824,ARGUMENT.,
825,ARGUMENT.,"“Which of the gods again, O deceitful one, has been concerting measures"
826,ARGUMENT.,"with thee? Ever is it agreeable to thee, being apart from me, plotting"
827,ARGUMENT.,"secret things, to decide thereon; nor hast thou ever yet deigned"
828,ARGUMENT.,willingly to tell me one word of what thou dost meditate.”
829,ARGUMENT.,
830,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 59: (return)  Heyne supplies “sedendo.”
831,ARGUMENT.,
832,ARGUMENT.,"To her then replied the father of men and gods: “O Juno, build up no"
833,ARGUMENT.,"hopes of knowing all my counsels; difficult would they be for thee,"
834,ARGUMENT.,although thou art my consort. But whatever it may be fit for thee to
835,ARGUMENT.,"hear, none then either of gods or men shall know it before thee: but"
836,ARGUMENT.,"whatever I wish to consider apart from the gods, do thou neither"
837,ARGUMENT.,"inquire into any of these things, nor investigate them.”"
838,ARGUMENT.,
839,ARGUMENT.,"But him the large-eyed, venerable Juno then answered: “Most dread son"
840,ARGUMENT.,"of Saturn, what a word hast thou spoken? Heretofore have I ever"
841,ARGUMENT.,"questioned thee much, nor pryed [into thy secrets]; but thou mayest"
842,ARGUMENT.,very quietly deliberate on those things which thou desirest. But at
843,ARGUMENT.,"present I greatly fear in my soul, lest silver-footed Thetis, the"
844,ARGUMENT.,"daughter of the marine old man, may have influenced thee: for at dawn"
845,ARGUMENT.,she sat by thee and embraced thy knees: to her I suspect thou didst
846,ARGUMENT.,"plainly promise that thou wouldest honour Achilles, and destroy many at"
847,ARGUMENT.,the ships of the Greeks.”
848,ARGUMENT.,
849,ARGUMENT.,"But her answering, cloud-compelling Jove addressed: “Perverse one! thou"
850,ARGUMENT.,"art always suspecting, nor do I escape thee. Nevertheless thou shalt"
851,ARGUMENT.,"produce no effect at all, but thou shalt be farther from my heart: and"
852,ARGUMENT.,"this will be more bitter to thee. But granted this be so, it appears to"
853,ARGUMENT.,"be my pleasure. 60 But sit down in peace, and obey my mandate, lest as"
854,ARGUMENT.,"many deities as are in Olympus avail thee not against me, I drawing"
855,ARGUMENT.,"near, 61 when I shall lay my resistless hands upon thee.”"

863,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke: but venerable, large-eyed Juno feared, and sat down"
864,ARGUMENT.,"silent, having bent her heart to submission. But the heavenly gods"
865,ARGUMENT.,"murmured throughout the palace of Jove. And the renowned artificer,"
866,ARGUMENT.,"Vulcan, began to harangue them, doing kind offices to his beloved"
867,ARGUMENT.,"mother, white-armed Juno:"
868,ARGUMENT.,
869,ARGUMENT.,"“Truly now these will be grievous matters, and no longer tolerable, if"
870,ARGUMENT.,"ye twain contend thus on account of mortals, and excite uproar among"
871,ARGUMENT.,"the deities. Nor will there be any enjoyment in the delightful banquet,"
872,ARGUMENT.,"since the worse things prevail. 62 But to my mother I advise, she"
873,ARGUMENT.,"herself being intelligent, to gratify my dear father Jove, lest my sire"
874,ARGUMENT.,"may again reprove her, and disturb our banquet. For if the Olympian"
875,ARGUMENT.,Thunderer wishes to hurl [us] from our seats 63—for he is much the most
876,ARGUMENT.,powerful. But do thou soothe him with gentle words; then will the
877,ARGUMENT.,Olympian king straightway be propitious to us.”

888,ARGUMENT.,"“Be patient, my mother, and restrain thyself, although grieved, lest"
889,ARGUMENT.,"with my own eyes I behold thee beaten, being very dear to me; nor then"
890,ARGUMENT.,"indeed should I be able, though full of grief, to assist thee; for"
891,ARGUMENT.,"Olympian Jove is difficult to be opposed. For heretofore, having seized"
892,ARGUMENT.,"me by the foot, he cast me, desiring at one time to assist you, down"
893,ARGUMENT.,from the heavenly threshold. All day was I carried down through the
894,ARGUMENT.,"air, and I fell on Lemnos 65 with the setting sun: and but little life"
895,ARGUMENT.,was in me by that time. There the Sintian 66 men forthwith received and
896,ARGUMENT.,"tended 67 me, having fallen.”"
897,ARGUMENT.,
898,ARGUMENT.,Thus he spoke: but the white-armed goddess Juno smiled; and smiling she
899,ARGUMENT.,"received the cup from the hand of her son. But he, beginning from left"
900,ARGUMENT.,"to right, 68 kept pouring out for all the other gods, drawing nectar"
901,ARGUMENT.,from the goblet. And then inextinguishable laughter arose among the
902,ARGUMENT.,"immortal gods, when they saw Vulcan bustling about 69 through the"
903,ARGUMENT.,mansion.

963,ARGUMENT.,"fatal dream 72 to Agamemnon, the son of Atreus. And addressing him, he"

965,ARGUMENT.,
966,ARGUMENT.,"“Haste away, pernicious dream, to the swift ships of the Greeks. Going"
967,ARGUMENT.,"into the tent of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, utter very accurately"

977,ARGUMENT.,"sleeping in his tent, and ambrosial slumber was diffused around. And he"
978,ARGUMENT.,"stood over his head, like unto Nestor, the son of Neleus, him, to wit,"
979,ARGUMENT.,whom Agamemnon honoured most of the old men. To him assimilating

1011,ARGUMENT.,"Thus then having spoken, he departed, and left him there pondering"

1016,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans and Greeks, through mighty conflicts. But he awoke from his"

1018,ARGUMENT.,"and put on his soft tunic, beautiful, new; and around him he threw his"
1019,ARGUMENT.,"large cloak. And he bound his beautiful sandals on his shining feet,"
1020,ARGUMENT.,and slung from his shoulders the silver-studded sword. He also took his

1042,ARGUMENT.,"thou, son of the warrior, horse-taming Atreus? It becomes not a"
1043,ARGUMENT.,"counsellor, to whom the people have been intrusted, and to whom so many"

1052,ARGUMENT.,"away, it departed; but sweet sleep resigned me. But come, [let us try]"
1053,ARGUMENT.,if by any means we can arm the sons of the Greeks. But first with words
1054,ARGUMENT.,"will I sound their inclinations, as is right, and I will command them"
1055,ARGUMENT.,to fly with their many-benched ships; but do you restrain them with
1056,ARGUMENT.,"words, one in one place, another in another.”"
1057,ARGUMENT.,
1058,ARGUMENT.,"He indeed having thus spoken, sat down; but Nestor, who was king of"
1059,ARGUMENT.,"sandy Pylus, rose up, who wisely counselling, harangued them, and said:"

1065,ARGUMENT.,"army. But come on, if by any means we can arm the sons of the Greeks.”"
1066,ARGUMENT.,
1067,ARGUMENT.,"Thus then having spoken, he began to depart from the assembly; and"
1068,ARGUMENT.,"they, the sceptre-bearing princes, arose, and obeyed the shepherd of"
1069,ARGUMENT.,"the tribes, and the hosts rushed forward. Even as the swarms of"
1070,ARGUMENT.,"clustering bees, 79 issuing ever anew from the hollow rock, go forth,"
1071,ARGUMENT.,"and fly in troops over the vernal 80 flowers, and some have flitted in"
1072,ARGUMENT.,"bodies here, and some there; thus of these [Greeks] many nations from"
1073,ARGUMENT.,the ships and tents kept marching in troops in front of the steep shore
1074,ARGUMENT.,"to the assembly. And in the midst of them blazed Rumour, messenger of"
1075,ARGUMENT.,"Jove, urging them to proceed; and they kept collecting together. The"
1076,ARGUMENT.,"assembly was tumultuous, and the earth groaned beneath, as the people"
1077,ARGUMENT.,"seated themselves, and there was a clamour; but nine heralds"
1078,ARGUMENT.,"vociferating restrained them, if by any means they would cease from"
1079,ARGUMENT.,"clamour, and hear the Jove-nurtured princes. With difficulty at length"

1315,ARGUMENT.,"Atreus, the leader of the people, because the Grecian heroes give him"
1316,ARGUMENT.,"very many gifts, whilst thou, insulting, dost harangue. But I declare"
1317,ARGUMENT.,"to thee, which shall also be accomplished: if ever again I catch thee"
1318,ARGUMENT.,"raving, as now thou art, no longer may the head of Ulysses rest upon"
1319,ARGUMENT.,"his shoulders, and no longer may I be called the father of Telemachus,"

1326,ARGUMENT.,bloody weal arose under the sceptre upon his back. But he sat down and
1327,ARGUMENT.,"trembled; and grieving, looking foolish, he wiped away the tears. They,"
1328,ARGUMENT.,"although chagrined, laughed heartily at him, and thus one would say,"

1331,ARGUMENT.,“O strange! surely ten thousand good deeds has Ulysses already
1332,ARGUMENT.,"performed, both originating good counsels, and arousing the war. But"
1333,ARGUMENT.,"now has he done this by far the best deed amongst the Greeks, in that"
1334,ARGUMENT.,he has restrained this foul-mouthed reviler from his harangues. Surely
1335,ARGUMENT.,his petulant mind will not again urge him to chide the kings with
1336,ARGUMENT.,scurrilous language.”
1337,ARGUMENT.,
1338,ARGUMENT.,"Thus spake the multitude; but Ulysses, the sacker of cities, arose,"
1339,ARGUMENT.,"holding the sceptre, and beside him azure-eyed Minerva, likened unto a"
1340,ARGUMENT.,"herald, ordered the people to be silent, that at the same time the sons"
1341,ARGUMENT.,"of the Greeks, both first and last, might hear his speech, and weigh"
1342,ARGUMENT.,"his counsel. He wisely counselling, addressed them, and said:"
1343,ARGUMENT.,
1344,ARGUMENT.,"“O son of Atreus, the Greeks wish to render thee now, O king, the"
1345,ARGUMENT.,meanest amongst articulately-speaking men; nor perform their promise to
1346,ARGUMENT.,"thee, 100 which they held forth, coming hither from steed-nourishing"
1347,ARGUMENT.,"Argos, that thou shouldest return home, having destroyed well-fortified"
1348,ARGUMENT.,"Ilium. For, like tender boys, or widowed women, they bewail unto one"
1349,ARGUMENT.,"another to return home. And truly it is a hardship to return [so],"
1350,ARGUMENT.,having been grieved. For he is impatient who is absent even for a
1351,ARGUMENT.,"single month from his wife, remaining with his many-benched ship, 101"
1352,ARGUMENT.,though wintry storms and the boisterous sea may be hemming in; 102 but
1353,ARGUMENT.,to us it is [now] the ninth revolving year since we have been lingering
1354,ARGUMENT.,here. Wherefore I am not indignant that the Greeks are growing
1355,ARGUMENT.,impatient by their curved ships; but still it would be disgraceful both
1356,ARGUMENT.,"to remain here so long, and to return ineffectually. Endure, my"
1357,ARGUMENT.,"friends, and remain yet awhile, that we may know whether Calchas"
1358,ARGUMENT.,"prophesies truly or not. For this we well know, and ye are all"
1359,ARGUMENT.,"witnesses, whom the Fates of death carried not off yesterday and the"
1360,ARGUMENT.,"day before, when the ships of the Greeks were collected at Aulis,"
1361,ARGUMENT.,"bearing evils to Priam and the Trojans, and we round about the"
1362,ARGUMENT.,"fountain, at the sacred altars, offered perfect hecatombs to the"
1363,ARGUMENT.,"immortals, beneath a beauteous plane-tree, whence flowed limpid water."
1364,ARGUMENT.,"103 There a great prodigy appeared; a serpent, spotted on the back,"
1365,ARGUMENT.,"horrible, which the Olympian himself had sent forth into the light,"
1366,ARGUMENT.,"having glided out from beneath the altar, proceeded forthwith to the"
1367,ARGUMENT.,"plane-tree. And there were the young of a sparrow, an infant offspring,"
1368,ARGUMENT.,"on a topmost branch, cowering amongst the foliage, eight in number; but"
1369,ARGUMENT.,"the mother, which had brought forth the young ones, was the ninth."
1370,ARGUMENT.,"Thereupon he devoured them, twittering piteously, while the mother kept"
1371,ARGUMENT.,"fluttering about, lamenting her dear young; but then, having turned"
1372,ARGUMENT.,"himself about, he seized her by the wing, screaming around. But after"
1373,ARGUMENT.,"he had devoured the young of the sparrow, and herself, the god who had"
1374,ARGUMENT.,"displayed him rendered him very portentous, for the son of wily Saturn"
1375,ARGUMENT.,"changed him into a stone; but we, standing by, were astonished at what"
1376,ARGUMENT.,"happened. Thus, therefore, the dreadful portents of the gods approached"
1377,ARGUMENT.,"the hecatombs. Calchas, then, immediately addressed us, revealing from"
1378,ARGUMENT.,"the gods: ‘Why are ye become silent, ye waving-crested Greeks? For us,"
1379,ARGUMENT.,"indeed, provident Jove has shown a great sign, late, of late"
1380,ARGUMENT.,"accomplishment, the renown of which shall never perish. As this"
1381,ARGUMENT.,"[serpent] has devoured the young of the sparrow, eight in number, and"
1382,ARGUMENT.,"herself, the mother which brought out the brood, was the ninth, so must"
1383,ARGUMENT.,"we for as many years 104 wage war here, but in the tenth we shall take"
1384,ARGUMENT.,the wide-wayed city.’ He indeed thus harangued: and all these things
1385,ARGUMENT.,"are now in course of accomplishment. But come, ye well-greaved Greeks,"
1386,ARGUMENT.,"remain all here, until we shall take the great city of Priam.”"

1416,ARGUMENT.,"thoughts of men have sunk, and the unmixed libations, and the right"
1417,ARGUMENT.,"hands in which we trusted; for in vain do we dispute with words, nor"
1418,ARGUMENT.,"can we discover any resource, although we have been here for a long"
1419,ARGUMENT.,"time. But do thou, O son of Atreus, maintaining, as before, thy purpose"
1420,ARGUMENT.,"firm, command the Greeks in the hard-fought conflicts; and abandon"
1421,ARGUMENT.,"those to perish, one and both, 106 who, separated from the Greeks, are"
1422,ARGUMENT.,"meditating [but success shall not attend them] to return back to Argos,"
1423,ARGUMENT.,before they know whether the promise of ægis-bearing Jove be false or
1424,ARGUMENT.,"not. For I say that the powerful son of Saturn assented on that day,"
1425,ARGUMENT.,"when the Argives embarked in their swift ships, bearing death and fate"
1426,ARGUMENT.,"to the Trojans, flashing 107 his lightning on the right, and showing"
1427,ARGUMENT.,"propitious signs. Let not any one, therefore, hasten to return home"
1428,ARGUMENT.,"before each has slept with a Trojan wife, and has avenged the cares 108"
1429,ARGUMENT.,and griefs of Helen. But if any one is extravagantly eager to return
1430,ARGUMENT.,"home, let him lay hands upon his well-benched black ship, that he may"
1431,ARGUMENT.,draw on death and fate before others. But do thou thyself deliberate
1432,ARGUMENT.,"well, O king, and attend to another; nor shall the advice which I am"
1433,ARGUMENT.,"about to utter be discarded. Separate the troops, Agamemnon, according"
1434,ARGUMENT.,"to their tribes and clans, that kindred may support kindred, and clan."
1435,ARGUMENT.,"If thou wilt thus act, and the Greeks obey, thou wilt then ascertain"
1436,ARGUMENT.,"which of the generals and which of the soldiers is a dastard, and which"
1437,ARGUMENT.,"of them may be brave, for they will fight their best, 109 and thou wilt"
1438,ARGUMENT.,likewise learn whether it is by the divine interposition that thou art

1472,ARGUMENT.,"swift-footed steeds, and let each one, looking well to his chariot, get"
1473,ARGUMENT.,ready for war; that we may contend all day in the dreadful battle. Nor

2137,ARGUMENT.,
2138,ARGUMENT.,"But when they now were near, approaching each other, godlike Alexander"

2168,ARGUMENT.,"that thou wast a noble champion, because a fine person belongs [to"
2169,ARGUMENT.,"thee]; but there is not strength in thy soul, nor any nerve. Didst"
2170,ARGUMENT.,"thou, being such a one, having sailed over the ocean in sea-traversing"
2171,ARGUMENT.,"ships, having collected congenial associates, and mingled with"
2172,ARGUMENT.,"foreigners, take away a beauteous lady, from the Apian land, the spouse"

2178,ARGUMENT.,"avail thee, when thou shalt be mingled with the dust. 147 But the"

2232,ARGUMENT.,"“Hear from me, ye Trojans, and well-greaved Greeks, the proposal of"
2233,ARGUMENT.,"Alexander, on whose account this strife has arisen. He advises that the"
2234,ARGUMENT.,other Trojans and all the Greeks should lay down their beauteous arms
2235,ARGUMENT.,upon the bounteous earth; but that he and Mars-beloved Menelaus alone

2239,ARGUMENT.,but let the rest of us strike a friendship and faithful league.”
2240,ARGUMENT.,
2241,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he said, and all became mute in silence. But amidst them Menelaus,"
2242,ARGUMENT.,"valiant in the din of war, thus spoke:"
2243,ARGUMENT.,
2244,ARGUMENT.,“Now hear me also; for anguish has invaded my soul most: but I purpose
2245,ARGUMENT.,"that the Greeks and Trojans should now be separated, since ye have"
2246,ARGUMENT.,suffered many evils on account of my quarrel and the beginning of [this

2248,ARGUMENT.,"been ordained, let him die; but do the rest of you be very speedily"
2249,ARGUMENT.,"separated. And bring lambs—one white, the other black—to the Earth and"
2250,ARGUMENT.,to the Sun; and we will bring another to Jove. Moreover ye shall bring

2253,ARGUMENT.,the covenant of Jove. For the minds of younger men are ever
2254,ARGUMENT.,"fluctuating; but for those among whom a senior is present, he looks at"
2255,ARGUMENT.,"the same time both backward and forward, in order that the best results"
2256,ARGUMENT.,may accrue to both parties.”
2257,ARGUMENT.,
2258,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke. But both Greeks and Trojans rejoiced, hoping to have"
2259,ARGUMENT.,respite from grievous war. And they accordingly reined back their
2260,ARGUMENT.,"horses to the ranks [of the foot], but dismounted themselves, and put"
2261,ARGUMENT.,"off their arms, and laid them down on the ground near each other; and"
2262,ARGUMENT.,around [each pile of arms] there was a little space.
2263,ARGUMENT.,
2264,ARGUMENT.,"But Hector despatched two heralds to the city with speed, to bring the"

2267,ARGUMENT.,And he did not disobey noble Agamemnon.
2268,ARGUMENT.,
2269,ARGUMENT.,"And meantime came Iris a messenger to white-armed Helen, likening"

2271,ARGUMENT.,"excelling in beauty of the daughters of Priam, Laodice, whom the son of"
2272,ARGUMENT.,"Antenor, king Helicaon, possessed. But she found her in her palace, and"
2273,ARGUMENT.,"she was weaving an ample web, a double [mantle], 150 resplendent, and"
2274,ARGUMENT.,on it was working many labours both of the horse-taming Trojans and the
2275,ARGUMENT.,"brazen-mailed Greeks, which on her account they suffered at the hands"

2278,ARGUMENT.,"“Come hither, dear lady, 151 that thou mayest view the wondrous deeds"
2279,ARGUMENT.,"of the horse-taming Trojans, and of the brazen-mailed Greeks, who"
2280,ARGUMENT.,"formerly against each other waged tearful war in the plain, eager for"
2281,ARGUMENT.,"destructive battle. Now, however, they sit in silence (and the war has"

2314,ARGUMENT.,Greeks endure hardships for a long time on account of such a woman. In
2315,ARGUMENT.,"countenance she is wondrous like unto the immortal goddess, but even"
2316,ARGUMENT.,"so, although being such, let her return in the ships, nor be left a"
2317,ARGUMENT.,destruction to us and to our children hereafter.”
2318,ARGUMENT.,
2319,ARGUMENT.,"Thus they spoke. But Priam called Helen,—“Coming hither before us, dear"
2320,ARGUMENT.,"daughter, sit by me, that thou mayest see thy former husband, thy"
2321,ARGUMENT.,"kindred, and thy friends—(thou art not at all in fault towards me; the"
2322,ARGUMENT.,"gods, in truth, are in fault towards me, who have sent against me the"
2323,ARGUMENT.,lamentable war of the Greeks)—that thou mayest name for me this mighty
2324,ARGUMENT.,"man, who is this gallant and tall Grecian hero. Certainly there are"
2325,ARGUMENT.,others taller in height; but so graceful a man have I never yet beheld
2326,ARGUMENT.,"with my eyes, nor so venerable; for he is like unto a kingly man.”"
2327,ARGUMENT.,
2328,ARGUMENT.,"But him Helen, one of the divine women, answered in [these] words:"
2329,ARGUMENT.,"“Revered art thou and feared by me, dear father-in-law; would that an"
2330,ARGUMENT.,"evil death had pleased me, when I followed thy son hither, having left"
2331,ARGUMENT.,"my marriage-bed, my brothers, my darling 154 daughter, and the"
2332,ARGUMENT.,congenial company of my equals. But these things were not done:
2333,ARGUMENT.,"therefore I pine away with weeping. But this will I tell thee, which"
2334,ARGUMENT.,"thou seekest of me and inquirest. This is wide-ruling Agamemnon, son of"
2335,ARGUMENT.,"Atreus, in both characters, 155 a good king and a brave warrior. He was"
2336,ARGUMENT.,"the brother-in-law, moreover, of shameless me, if ever indeed he was.”"

2346,ARGUMENT.,
2347,ARGUMENT.,"Thus she spoke. But him the old man admired, and said “O blessed son of"
2348,ARGUMENT.,"Atreus, happy-born, fortunate, truly indeed were many Achæan youths"
2349,ARGUMENT.,"made subject to thee. Before now I entered vine-bearing Phrygia, where"
2350,ARGUMENT.,"I beheld many Phrygians, heroes on fleet horses, the forces of Otreus"
2351,ARGUMENT.,"and godlike Mygdon, who encamped there near the banks of the Sangarius."
2352,ARGUMENT.,"For I also, being an ally, was numbered with them on that day, when the"
2353,ARGUMENT.,man-opposing Amazons came. But not even these were so numerous as the
2354,ARGUMENT.,black-eyed Greeks.”
2355,ARGUMENT.,
2356,ARGUMENT.,"But next perceiving 157 Ulysses, the old man asked her: “Come, tell me"
2357,ARGUMENT.,"of this one also, dear daughter, who he is? he is less indeed in height"
2358,ARGUMENT.,"158 than Agamemnon, the son of Atreus, but is broader to behold in"
2359,ARGUMENT.,"shoulders and breast. His arms lie up on the fertile earth, but he"
2360,ARGUMENT.,"himself, like a ram, goes round the ranks of the men. I for my part"
2361,ARGUMENT.,"compare him to a thick-fleeced ram, which wanders through a great flock"
2362,ARGUMENT.,of snowy sheep.”

2371,ARGUMENT.,"this common mistake, although Wolf had pointed it out."
2372,ARGUMENT.,
2373,ARGUMENT.,"But him Helen, sprung from Jove, answered: “Now, this one again is the"
2374,ARGUMENT.,"son of Laertes, much-scheming Ulysses, who was bred in the country of"
2375,ARGUMENT.,"Ithaca, rugged though it be, skilled in all kinds of stratagems and"
2376,ARGUMENT.,prudent counsels.”
2377,ARGUMENT.,
2378,ARGUMENT.,"Her then the sage Antenor addressed in reply: “O lady, assuredly hast"
2379,ARGUMENT.,thou spoken this word very truly: for already in former times divine
2380,ARGUMENT.,"Ulysses came hither also, on an embassy concerning thee, with"
2381,ARGUMENT.,"Mars-beloved Menelaus. I received them as guests, and entertained them"
2382,ARGUMENT.,"in my palace, and became acquainted with the genius of both, and their"
2383,ARGUMENT.,prudent counsels; but when they were mingled with the assembled
2384,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans, Menelaus indeed overtopped him, as they stood by his broad"
2385,ARGUMENT.,"shoulders; but when both were sitting, Ulysses was more majestic. 159"
2386,ARGUMENT.,"But when they began to weave words and counsels for all, Menelaus, on"
2387,ARGUMENT.,"his part, would harangue very fluently; a few [words] indeed, but very"
2388,ARGUMENT.,"sweetly, since he was not loquacious, nor a random talker, though he"
2389,ARGUMENT.,"was younger in age. But when much-counselling Ulysses arose, he stood"
2390,ARGUMENT.,"and looked down, fixing his eyes on the earth, but he neither moved his"
2391,ARGUMENT.,"sceptre backwards nor forwards, but held it unmoved like an unskilful"
2392,ARGUMENT.,"man: you would say indeed that he was a very irritable man, as well as"
2393,ARGUMENT.,devoid of reason. But when he did send forth the mighty voice from his
2394,ARGUMENT.,"breast, and words like unto wintry flakes of snow, no longer then would"
2395,ARGUMENT.,"another mortal contend with Ulysses. And beholding, we then marvelled"
2396,ARGUMENT.,"not so much at the aspect of Ulysses, [as at his words].”"

2402,ARGUMENT.,
2403,ARGUMENT.,"Then in the third place, having beheld Ajax, the old man asked: “Who is"
2404,ARGUMENT.,"that other Achæan hero, valiant and great, out-topping the Argives by"
2405,ARGUMENT.,his head and broad shoulders?”
2406,ARGUMENT.,
2407,ARGUMENT.,"But him long-robed Helen answered, divine of women: “This indeed is"
2408,ARGUMENT.,"mighty Ajax, the bulwark of the Achæans: on the other side, amongst the"
2409,ARGUMENT.,"Cretans, stands Idomeneus like unto a god: but around him the leaders"
2410,ARGUMENT.,of the Cretans are collected. Often did Mars-beloved Menelaus entertain
2411,ARGUMENT.,"him in our palace, when he would come from Crete. But now I behold all"
2412,ARGUMENT.,"the other rolling-eyed Greeks, whom I could easily recognize, and"
2413,ARGUMENT.,pronounce their names; but two leaders of the people I cannot see:
2414,ARGUMENT.,"horse-taming Castor, and Pollux skilled in boxing, twin brothers, whom"
2415,ARGUMENT.,the same mother brought forth with me. Either they have not followed
2416,ARGUMENT.,"from pleasant Lacedæmon, or they indeed have followed hither in the"
2417,ARGUMENT.,"sea-traversing ships, but now are reluctant to enter the fight of the"
2418,ARGUMENT.,"heroes, fearing the disgrace, and the many reproaches which are mine.”"
2419,ARGUMENT.,
2420,ARGUMENT.,Thus she spoke; but them the life-bestowing earth already possessed:

2428,ARGUMENT.,
2429,ARGUMENT.,"But heralds through the city were bearing the firm pledges of the gods,"
2430,ARGUMENT.,"two lambs and joyous wine, the fruit of the earth, in a goat-skin"
2431,ARGUMENT.,"flagon. But the herald Idæus also brought a splendid goblet, and golden"
2432,ARGUMENT.,"cups; and standing by him, incited the old man in these words:"
2433,ARGUMENT.,
2434,ARGUMENT.,"“Arise, son of Laomedon; the chiefs of the horse-breaking Trojans, and"
2435,ARGUMENT.,"of the brazen-mailed Greeks, call thee to descend into the plain, that"
2436,ARGUMENT.,thou mayest ratify a faithful league. For Alexander and Mars-beloved
2437,ARGUMENT.,Menelaus are about to fight with long spears for the woman. But let the
2438,ARGUMENT.,"woman and the effects attend the conqueror; but let the rest of us,"
2439,ARGUMENT.,"having struck a friendship and faithful league, inhabit fruitful Troy,"
2440,ARGUMENT.,"and they shall return to horse-feeding Argos, and to Achaia, famed for"
2441,ARGUMENT.,fair dames.”
2442,ARGUMENT.,
2443,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he said, but the old man shuddered, and ordered his attendants to"
2444,ARGUMENT.,yoke his horses; and they briskly obeyed. Priam then mounted his
2445,ARGUMENT.,"chariot, and drew back the reins: and beside him Antenor mounted the"
2446,ARGUMENT.,beautiful chariot. So they guided their fleet steeds through the Scæan
2447,ARGUMENT.,"gates, towards the plain."
2448,ARGUMENT.,
2449,ARGUMENT.,"But when they had now come between the Trojans and the Greeks,"
2450,ARGUMENT.,"descending from their steeds to the fruitful earth, they advanced into"
2451,ARGUMENT.,"the midst of the Trojans and Greeks. Then Agamemnon, king of heroes,"
2452,ARGUMENT.,"immediately arose, and much-counselling Ulysses arose. But the"
2453,ARGUMENT.,illustrious heralds collected together the faithful pledges of the
2454,ARGUMENT.,"gods, and mixed wine in a bowl, and poured water upon the hands of the"
2455,ARGUMENT.,"kings. And the son of Atreus, drawing with his hands his dagger, which"
2456,ARGUMENT.,"was always suspended at the huge sheath of his sword, cut off hairs"
2457,ARGUMENT.,from the heads of the lambs: and then the heralds distributed them to
2458,ARGUMENT.,the chiefs of the Trojans and the Greeks. Amongst them the son of
2459,ARGUMENT.,"Atreus prayed earnestly, having stretched forth his hands:"
2460,ARGUMENT.,
2461,ARGUMENT.,"“O father Jove, ruling from Ida, most glorious, most mighty,—and thou,"
2462,ARGUMENT.,"O sun, who beholdest all things, and nearest all things—and ye rivers,"
2463,ARGUMENT.,"and thou earth, and ye below who punish men deceased, whosoever swears"
2464,ARGUMENT.,"with perjury, be ye witnesses and preserve the faithful league. If, on"
2465,ARGUMENT.,"the one hand, Alexander should slay Menelaus, let him thenceforth"
2466,ARGUMENT.,retain Helen and all her possessions; but let us return in our
2467,ARGUMENT.,"sea-traversing ships. But if, on the contrary, yellow-haired Menelaus"
2468,ARGUMENT.,"slay Alexander, let the Trojans then restore Helen and all her"
2469,ARGUMENT.,"treasures, and pay a fine to the Argives such as is just, and which may"
2470,ARGUMENT.,be [recorded] amongst posterity. But if Priam and the sons of Priam
2471,ARGUMENT.,"will not pay me the fine, on Alexander falling, then will I afterwards"
2472,ARGUMENT.,"fight on account of the fine, remaining here till I find an end of the"
2473,ARGUMENT.,war.”
2474,ARGUMENT.,
2475,ARGUMENT.,"He spoke, and cut the throats of the lambs with the cruel steel, and he"
2476,ARGUMENT.,"laid them on the earth panting, wanting life; for the brass had taken"
2477,ARGUMENT.,"away their [vital] strength. Then having drawn wine from the goblet,"
2478,ARGUMENT.,"they poured it into the cups, and prayed to the immortal gods. But thus"
2479,ARGUMENT.,some one of the Greeks and Trojans said:
2480,ARGUMENT.,
2481,ARGUMENT.,"“Ο Jove, most glorious, most mighty, and ye other immortal gods,"
2482,ARGUMENT.,"whoever first shall offend against the leagues, so let the brain of"
2483,ARGUMENT.,"themselves and of their children stream upon the ground like this wine,"
2484,ARGUMENT.,and let their wives be mingled with other men.”
2485,ARGUMENT.,
2486,ARGUMENT.,"Thus they said, nor yet did the son of Saturn ratify [their vows]. Then"
2487,ARGUMENT.,"Priam, the son of Dardanus, addressed them:"
2488,ARGUMENT.,
2489,ARGUMENT.,"“Hear me, ye Trojans, and ye well-greaved Greeks: I, indeed, return"
2490,ARGUMENT.,"again to wind-swept Ilion, since I can by no means endure to behold"
2491,ARGUMENT.,"with these eyes my dear son fighting with Mars-beloved Menelaus. Jove,"
2492,ARGUMENT.,"certainly, knows this, and the other immortal gods, to which of them"
2493,ARGUMENT.,the event of death is destined.”
2494,ARGUMENT.,
2495,ARGUMENT.,"He spoke, and the godlike man placed the lambs in the chariot, and"
2496,ARGUMENT.,"ascended himself, and drew back the reins; and beside him Antenor"
2497,ARGUMENT.,mounted the very beautiful chariot. They on their part returning went
2498,ARGUMENT.,back towards Ilion.
2499,ARGUMENT.,
2500,ARGUMENT.,"But Hector on the other hand, the son of Priam, and divine Ulysses,"
2501,ARGUMENT.,"first measured the ground; then taking the lots, they shook them in the"
2502,ARGUMENT.,"brazen helmet, [to decide] which should hurl the brazen spear first."
2503,ARGUMENT.,"But the people meantime supplicated, and stretched forth their hands to"
2504,ARGUMENT.,the gods; and thus some one of the Greeks and Trojans said:
2505,ARGUMENT.,
2506,ARGUMENT.,"“O father Jove, ruling from Ida, most glorious, most mighty, whichever"
2507,ARGUMENT.,"has caused these evil works to both sides, grant that he, being slain,"
2508,ARGUMENT.,"may enter the house of Pluto, but that to us, on the other hand, there"
2509,ARGUMENT.,may be friendship and a faithful league.”
2510,ARGUMENT.,
2511,ARGUMENT.,"Thus then they spoke, and now mighty helm-quivering Hector shook the"
2512,ARGUMENT.,"lots, looking backward; and quickly the lot of Paris leaped forth. They"
2513,ARGUMENT.,"then sat down in their ranks, where the fleet steeds of each stood, and"
2514,ARGUMENT.,"their varied arms lay. But divine Alexander, the husband of fair-haired"
2515,ARGUMENT.,"Helen, put on his beauteous armour around his shoulders. In the first"
2516,ARGUMENT.,"place, around his legs he placed his beautiful greaves fitted with"
2517,ARGUMENT.,silver clasps; then again he put on his breast the corslet of his
2518,ARGUMENT.,"brother Lycaon, for it fitted him; but around his shoulders he slung"
2519,ARGUMENT.,"his brazen, silver-studded sword and then his huge and solid shield."
2520,ARGUMENT.,"But on his valiant head he placed a well-wrought helmet, crested with"
2521,ARGUMENT.,"horse-hair, and the crest nodded dreadfully from above; and he grasped"
2522,ARGUMENT.,"his doughty spear, which fitted to his hands. In this same manner the"
2523,ARGUMENT.,martial Menelaus put on his arms.
2524,ARGUMENT.,
2525,ARGUMENT.,"But they, when they were armed from each side of the throng, advanced"
2526,ARGUMENT.,"to the middle between the Trojans and Greeks, looking dreadfully; and"
2527,ARGUMENT.,"amazement seized the beholders, both the horse-breaking Trojans and the"
2528,ARGUMENT.,"well-greaved Greeks. They then stood near in the measured-out space,"
2529,ARGUMENT.,"brandishing their spears, incensed against each other. Alexander first"
2530,ARGUMENT.,"hurled his long-shadowed spear, and smote the shield of the son of"
2531,ARGUMENT.,"Atreus, equal on all sides, nor did the brass break, for the point"
2532,ARGUMENT.,"was bent upon the strong shield: but next Menelaus, son of Atreus,"
2533,ARGUMENT.,"commenced the attack with his brazen spear, praying to father Jove:"
2534,ARGUMENT.,
2535,ARGUMENT.,"“O king Jove, grant [me] to avenge myself [on him] who first injured"
2536,ARGUMENT.,"me, and subdue impious Alexander under my hands, that every one, even"
2537,ARGUMENT.,"of future men, may shudder to offer injury to a guest who may have"
2538,ARGUMENT.,afforded [him] an hospitable reception.”
2539,ARGUMENT.,
2540,ARGUMENT.,"He spoke; and brandishing, he hurled his long-shadowed spear, and smote"
2541,ARGUMENT.,"the shield of the son of Priam, equal on all sides; and through the"
2542,ARGUMENT.,"glittering shield went the impetuous spear, and was stuck firmly into"
2543,ARGUMENT.,the deftly-wrought corslet: and the spear pierced right through his
2544,ARGUMENT.,"soft tunic beside the flank: but he bent sideways, and evaded black"
2545,ARGUMENT.,"death. Next the son of Atreus having drawn his silver-studded sword,"
2546,ARGUMENT.,"raising it, struck the cone 161 of his helmet, but it fell from his"
2547,ARGUMENT.,hand shivered round about into three or four pieces. And the son of
2548,ARGUMENT.,"Atreus groaned aloud, looking towards the wide heaven:"
2549,ARGUMENT.,
2550,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 161: (return)  Buttmann, Lexil. p. 521, makes φαλος to be the"
2551,ARGUMENT.,"same as κωνος, a metal ridge in which the plume was fixed."
2552,ARGUMENT.,
2553,ARGUMENT.,"“Ο father Jove, none other of the gods is more baleful than thou."
2554,ARGUMENT.,Certainly I hoped to be revenged upon Alexander for his wickedness: but
2555,ARGUMENT.,"now my sword has been broken in my hands, and my spear has been hurled"
2556,ARGUMENT.,"from my hand in vain, nor have I smote him.”"
2557,ARGUMENT.,
2558,ARGUMENT.,"He spoke; and rushing on, he seized him by the horse-hair tufted"
2559,ARGUMENT.,"helmet, and turning, began to drag him to the well-greaved Greeks: but"
2560,ARGUMENT.,"the richly-embroidered band under his tender throat was choking him,"
2561,ARGUMENT.,which was drawn under his chin as the strap of his helmet. And now he
2562,ARGUMENT.,"had dragged him away, and obtained infinite glory, had not Venus, the"
2563,ARGUMENT.,"daughter of Jove, quickly perceived it, who broke for him 162 the"
2564,ARGUMENT.,"thong, [made] from the hide of an ox slaughtered by violence: and"
2565,ARGUMENT.,"thereupon the empty helmet followed with his strong hand. It, then, the"
2566,ARGUMENT.,"hero whirling round, cast to the well-greaved Greeks, and his dear"
2567,ARGUMENT.,"companions took it up. And he [Menelaus] again rushed on, desiring to"
2568,ARGUMENT.,"slay him with his brazen spear: but him [Paris] Venus very easily, as"
2569,ARGUMENT.,"being a goddess, rescued, and covered him in a thick mist; then placed"
2570,ARGUMENT.,"him down in his fragrant chamber, exhaling perfumes."
2571,ARGUMENT.,
2572,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 162: (return)  _I.e._ Menelaus.—to his confusion.
2573,ARGUMENT.,
2574,ARGUMENT.,"But she herself, on the other hand, went to call Helen, and she found"
2575,ARGUMENT.,"her on the lofty tower, and many Trojan dames around her. Then with her"
2576,ARGUMENT.,"hand catching her by the fragrant mantle, she shook her: and likening"
2577,ARGUMENT.,"herself to an ancient dame, a spinner of wool, who used to comb fair"
2578,ARGUMENT.,"wool for her when dwelling at Lacedæmon, and she loved her much: to her"
2579,ARGUMENT.,"having likened herself, divine Venus accosted [Helen]:"
2580,ARGUMENT.,
2581,ARGUMENT.,"“Come hither, Alexander calls thee to return home. He himself is in his"
2582,ARGUMENT.,"chamber and turned bed, shining both in beauty and attire; nor wouldst"
2583,ARGUMENT.,"thou say that he had returned after having fought with a hero, but that"
2584,ARGUMENT.,"he was going to the dance, or that just ceasing from the dance, he sat"
2585,ARGUMENT.,down.”
2586,ARGUMENT.,
2587,ARGUMENT.,"Thus she said, and agitated the heart in her breast: and when she"
2588,ARGUMENT.,"beheld the all-beauteous neck of the goddess, and her lovely bosom, and"
2589,ARGUMENT.,"her flashing eyes, she was awe-struck, and spoke a word, and said:"
2590,ARGUMENT.,
2591,ARGUMENT.,“Strange one! why dost thou desire to deceive me in these things? Wilt
2592,ARGUMENT.,"thou lead me anywhere farther on to one of the well-inhabited cities,"
2593,ARGUMENT.,"either of Phrygia or pleasant Mæonia, if there be any of"
2594,ARGUMENT.,"articulately-speaking men dear to thee there? Is it because Menelaus,"
2595,ARGUMENT.,"having now conquered noble Alexander, wishes to bring hated me home,"
2596,ARGUMENT.,"that therefore with artful purpose thou now standest near me? Going,"
2597,ARGUMENT.,"sit with him thyself, and renounce the path of the gods. And mayest"
2598,ARGUMENT.,thou no more return on thy feet to Olympus: but always grieve beside
2599,ARGUMENT.,"him, and watch him, until he either make thee his consort, or he indeed"
2600,ARGUMENT.,"[make thee] his handmaid. But there I will not go to adorn his couch,"
2601,ARGUMENT.,for it would be reprehensible: all the Trojan ladies henceforth will
2602,ARGUMENT.,reproach me. But I shall have woes without measure in my soul.”
2603,ARGUMENT.,
2604,ARGUMENT.,"But her, divine Venus, incensed, thus addressed: “Wretch, provoke me"
2605,ARGUMENT.,"not, lest in my wrath I abandon thee, and detest thee as much as"
2606,ARGUMENT.,"heretofore I have wonderfully loved thee, and lest I scatter"
2607,ARGUMENT.,"destructive hate in the midst of the Trojans and Greeks, and thou"
2608,ARGUMENT.,perish by an evil fate.”
2609,ARGUMENT.,
2610,ARGUMENT.,"Thus she spoke: but Helen, sprung from Jove, dreaded, and she went"
2611,ARGUMENT.,"covered with a white transparent robe, in silence; and escaped the"
2612,ARGUMENT.,"notice of all the Trojan dames, for the goddess led the way."
2613,ARGUMENT.,
2614,ARGUMENT.,"But when they reached the very beautiful palace of Alexander, then the"
2615,ARGUMENT.,"maids, on their part, turned themselves speedily to their tasks; but"
2616,ARGUMENT.,"she, divine of women, ascended into her lofty-roofed chamber: and then"
2617,ARGUMENT.,"laughter-loving Venus, carrying, placed a seat for her opposite"
2618,ARGUMENT.,"Alexander: there Helen, daughter of the ægis-bearing Jove, sat,"
2619,ARGUMENT.,"averting her eyes, and reproached her husband with these words:"
2620,ARGUMENT.,
2621,ARGUMENT.,"“Thou hast come from the war: would that thou hadst perished there,"
2622,ARGUMENT.,"slain by that brave hero, who was my former husband. Certainly, thou"
2623,ARGUMENT.,"didst formerly boast, that thou wast superior to Mars-beloved Menelaus,"
2624,ARGUMENT.,"in might, in hands, and at the spear. But go now, challenge"
2625,ARGUMENT.,Mars-beloved Menelaus to fight once more against thee! But I advise
2626,ARGUMENT.,"thee to refrain, nor unadvisedly wage war and fight against fair-haired"
2627,ARGUMENT.,"Menelaus, lest perchance thou mayest be subdued beneath his spear.”"
2628,ARGUMENT.,
2629,ARGUMENT.,But her Paris answering addressed in words: “Woman! assail me not in
2630,ARGUMENT.,soul with reproachful taunts; for now indeed has Menelaus conquered by
2631,ARGUMENT.,"Minerva’s aid; but I in turn will vanquish him, for gods are with us"
2632,ARGUMENT.,"also. But come, let us delight in dalliance, reclining together, for"
2633,ARGUMENT.,"never before did love so fondly enwrap my soul, not even when formerly,"
2634,ARGUMENT.,"having borne thee away from pleasant Lacedæmon, I sailed in the"
2635,ARGUMENT.,"sea-traversing ships, and was united with thee in love and in the couch"
2636,ARGUMENT.,"in the island Cranaë; so now am I enamoured of thee, and sweet desire"
2637,ARGUMENT.,possesses me.”
2638,ARGUMENT.,
2639,ARGUMENT.,"He spoke, and led the way, ascending the couch; but his wife followed"
2640,ARGUMENT.,with him: they therefore rested upon their perforated couch.
2641,ARGUMENT.,
2642,ARGUMENT.,Meanwhile the son of Atreus was wandering through the crowd like to a
2643,ARGUMENT.,"savage beast, if anywhere he could perceive godlike Alexander. But none"
2644,ARGUMENT.,of the Trojans or their illustrious allies could then point out
2645,ARGUMENT.,Alexander to Mars-beloved Menelaus; for neither through friendship
2646,ARGUMENT.,"would they have concealed him, if any one did see him; for he was"
2647,ARGUMENT.,"hateful to them all, like sable death. But amongst them spoke"
2648,ARGUMENT.,"Agamemnon, king of heroes:"
2649,ARGUMENT.,
2650,ARGUMENT.,"“Hear me, ye Trojans, Greeks, and allies: the victory indeed appears"
2651,ARGUMENT.,[to belong to] Mars-beloved Menelaus. Do ye therefore restore Argive
2652,ARGUMENT.,"Helen and her treasures with her, and pay the fine which is fitting,"
2653,ARGUMENT.,and which shall be remembered by future men.”
2654,ARGUMENT.,

2665,ARGUMENT.,"Paris not being slain, the combat left it doubtful whether Helen should"
2666,ARGUMENT.,be returned or not; but Juno extorts a promise from Jove of the final
2667,ARGUMENT.,destruction of Troy. Minerva then persuades Pandarus to break the truce
2668,ARGUMENT.,"by aiming an arrow at Menelaus. The wound is, however, cured by"
2669,ARGUMENT.,"Machaon. The Trojans proceed to the battle, while Agamemnon exhorts the"
2670,ARGUMENT.,"chieftains of the Greeks. The fight then commences, Mars and Apollo"
2671,ARGUMENT.,"encouraging the Trojans, Minerva and the other deities the Greeks."
2672,ARGUMENT.,

2674,ARGUMENT.,"Now they, the gods, sitting on the golden floor 163 with Jove, were"

2676,ARGUMENT.,"nectar: but they pledged 164 one another with golden cups, looking"
2677,ARGUMENT.,towards the city of the Trojans. Forthwith the son of Saturn attempted
2678,ARGUMENT.,"to irritate Juno, speaking with a covert allusion, with reproachful"
2679,ARGUMENT.,words: 165
2680,ARGUMENT.,
2681,ARGUMENT.,"“Two goddesses, indeed, are auxiliaries to Menelaus, Argive 166 Juno"
2682,ARGUMENT.,"and Minerva of Alalcomenæ: 167 and yet these, forsooth, sitting apart,"
2683,ARGUMENT.,"amuse themselves with looking on; but to the other, on the contrary"
2684,ARGUMENT.,"[Paris], laughter-loving Venus is ever present, 168 and averts fate"
2685,ARGUMENT.,"from him. Even now has she saved him, thinking that he was about to"
2686,ARGUMENT.,"die. But the victory, indeed, belongs to Mars-beloved Menelaus: let us"
2687,ARGUMENT.,"therefore consult how these things shall be, whether we shall again"
2688,ARGUMENT.,"excite the destructive war, and dreadful battle-din, or promote"
2689,ARGUMENT.,"friendship between both parties. And if, moreover, this shall perchance"
2690,ARGUMENT.,"169 be grateful and pleasing to all, the city of king Priam, indeed,"
2691,ARGUMENT.,"may be inhabited, but let Menelaus lead back again Argive Helen.”"

2713,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke: but Minerva and Juno murmured with closed lips, for they"
2714,ARGUMENT.,"were sitting near, and were devising evils for the Trojans. Minerva,"
2715,ARGUMENT.,"indeed, was silent, nor said anything, indignant with her father Jove,"
2716,ARGUMENT.,for dreadful rage possessed her. But Juno could not retain her fury in
2717,ARGUMENT.,"her breast, but addressed him:"
2718,ARGUMENT.,
2719,ARGUMENT.,“Most baleful son of Saturn! what a sentence hast thou uttered! How
2720,ARGUMENT.,"dost thou wish to render my labour vain, and my sweat fruitless, which"
2721,ARGUMENT.,I have sweated through with toil? For the steeds are tired to me
2722,ARGUMENT.,"assembling the host, evils to Priam and to his sons. Do so: but all we"
2723,ARGUMENT.,the other gods do not approve.”
2724,ARGUMENT.,
2725,ARGUMENT.,"But her cloud-compelling Jove, in great wrath, answered: “Strange one!"
2726,ARGUMENT.,how now do Priam and the sons of Priam work so many wrongs against
2727,ARGUMENT.,"thee, that thou desirest implacably to overturn the well-built city of"
2728,ARGUMENT.,"Ilion? But if thou, entering the gates and the lofty walls, couldst"
2729,ARGUMENT.,"devour alive 170 Priam and the sons of Priam, and the other Trojans,"
2730,ARGUMENT.,"then perhaps thou mightst satiate thy fury. Do as thou wilt, lest this"
2731,ARGUMENT.,contention be in future a great strife between thee and me. But another
2732,ARGUMENT.,"thing I tell thee, and do thou lay it up in thy soul: whenever haply I,"
2733,ARGUMENT.,"anxiously desiring, shall wish to destroy some city, where men dear to"
2734,ARGUMENT.,"thee are born, retard not my rage, but suffer me; for I have given thee"
2735,ARGUMENT.,"this of free will, though with unwilling mind. For of those cities of"
2736,ARGUMENT.,"earthly men, which are situated under the sun and the starry heaven,"
2737,ARGUMENT.,"sacred Ilion was most honoured by me in my heart, and Priam and the"
2738,ARGUMENT.,people of Priam skilled in the ashen spear. For there my altars never
2739,ARGUMENT.,"lacked a due banquet and libation, and savour; for this honour were we"
2740,ARGUMENT.,allotted.”

2744,ARGUMENT.,
2745,ARGUMENT.,Him then the venerable full-eyed Juno answered: “There are three
2746,ARGUMENT.,"cities, indeed, most dear to me: Argos, and Sparta, and wide-wayed"
2747,ARGUMENT.,Mycenæ; 171 destroy these whenever they become hateful to thy soul. In
2748,ARGUMENT.,"behalf of these I neither stand forth, nor do I grudge them to thee:"
2749,ARGUMENT.,"for even were I to grudge them, and not suffer thee to destroy them, by"
2750,ARGUMENT.,"grudging I avail nothing, since thou art much more powerful. And yet it"
2751,ARGUMENT.,"becomes [thee] to render my labour not fruitless; for I am a goddess,"
2752,ARGUMENT.,"and thence my race, whence thine; and wily Saturn begat me, very"
2753,ARGUMENT.,"venerable on two accounts, both by my parentage, and because I have"
2754,ARGUMENT.,"been called thy spouse. Moreover, thou rulest amongst all the"
2755,ARGUMENT.,"immortals. But truly let us make these concessions to each other: I, on"
2756,ARGUMENT.,"my part, to thee, and thou to me; and the other immortal gods will"
2757,ARGUMENT.,follow. Do thou without delay bid Minerva go to the dreadful battle-din
2758,ARGUMENT.,"of the Trojans and Greeks, and contrive that the Trojans may first"
2759,ARGUMENT.,"begin to injure the most renowned Greeks, contrary to the leagues.”"
2760,ARGUMENT.,
2761,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 171: (return)  “It certainly seems to me, that, in a reference"
2762,ARGUMENT.,so distinct to the three great Peloponnesian cities which the Dorians
2763,ARGUMENT.,"invaded and possessed, Homer makes as broad an allusion to the"
2764,ARGUMENT.,"conquests of the Heraclidæ, not only as would be consistent with the"
2765,ARGUMENT.,pride of an Ionic Greek in attesting the triumphs of the national
2766,ARGUMENT.,"Dorian foe, but as the nature of a theme cast in a distant period, and"
2767,ARGUMENT.,"remarkably removed, in its general conduct, from the historical detail"
2768,ARGUMENT.,"of subsequent events, would warrant to the poet.”—Bulwer, Athens, i. 8."
2769,ARGUMENT.,"The correctness of this view, however, depends upon the true date of"
2770,ARGUMENT.,Homer’s existence.
2771,ARGUMENT.,
2772,ARGUMENT.,Thus she spoke; nor did the father of gods and men disobey. Instantly
2773,ARGUMENT.,he addressed Minerva in winged words:
2774,ARGUMENT.,
2775,ARGUMENT.,"“Go very quickly to the army, among the Trojans and Greeks, and"
2776,ARGUMENT.,contrive that the Trojans may first begin to injure the most renowned
2777,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks, contrary to the league.”"
2778,ARGUMENT.,
2779,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having spoken, he urged on Minerva already inclined; she hastening"
2780,ARGUMENT.,descended the heights of Olympus; such as the star which the son of
2781,ARGUMENT.,"wily Saturn sends, a sign either to mariners, or to a wide host of"
2782,ARGUMENT.,"nations, and from it many sparks are emitted. Like unto this Pallas"
2783,ARGUMENT.,"Minerva hastened to the earth, and leaped into the midst [of the army];"
2784,ARGUMENT.,and astonishment seized the horse-breaking Trojans and the well-greaved
2785,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks, looking on. And thus would one say, looking at some other near"
2786,ARGUMENT.,him:
2787,ARGUMENT.,
2788,ARGUMENT.,"“Doubtless evil war and dreadful battle-din will take place again, or"
2789,ARGUMENT.,"Jove is establishing friendship between both sides, he who has been"
2790,ARGUMENT.,ordained the arbiter of war amongst men.” 172

2794,ARGUMENT.,"Θεος οπως ποτε αυτω δοκει, και το του πολεμου δίδωσι κρατος."
2795,ARGUMENT.,
2796,ARGUMENT.,Thus then did some one of the Greeks and Trojans say; but she like a
2797,ARGUMENT.,"hero entered the host of the Trojans, the brave warrior Laodocus, son"
2798,ARGUMENT.,"of Antenor, seeking godlike Pandarus, if anywhere she might find him."
2799,ARGUMENT.,"She found the blameless and valiant son of Lycaon standing, and around"
2800,ARGUMENT.,"him the brave ranks of shielded warriors, who had followed him from the"
2801,ARGUMENT.,"streams of Æsepus; and standing near, she thus to him spoke winged"
2802,ARGUMENT.,words:
2803,ARGUMENT.,
2804,ARGUMENT.,"“Wouldst thou now hearken to me in anything, O warlike son of Lycaon?"
2805,ARGUMENT.,Thou wouldst venture then to aim a swift arrow at Menelaus. Doubtless
2806,ARGUMENT.,"thou wouldst bear away both thanks and glory from all the Trojans, but"
2807,ARGUMENT.,"of all, chiefly from the prince Alexander, from whom, indeed, first of"
2808,ARGUMENT.,"all, thou wouldst receive splendid gifts, if he should see martial"
2809,ARGUMENT.,"Menelaus, the son of Atreus, subdued by this weapon, ascending the sad"
2810,ARGUMENT.,"pile. But come, aim an arrow at renowned Menelaus; and vow to"
2811,ARGUMENT.,"Lycian-born 173 Apollo, the renowned archer, that thou wilt sacrifice a"
2812,ARGUMENT.,"splendid hecatomb of firstling lambs, having returned home to the city"
2813,ARGUMENT.,of sacred Zeleia.”
2814,ARGUMENT.,
2815,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 173: (return)  This is probably the true interpretation, and"
2816,ARGUMENT.,"is given by the Scholiast, Hesychius, and others. But Heraclides,"
2817,ARGUMENT.,"Alleg. § 6, says that Apollo is so called επειδη του κατα την ορθριον"

2819,ARGUMENT.,ενιαυτον. Cf. Macrob. Sat. i. 17; Serv. on Æn. iv. 377.
2820,ARGUMENT.,
2821,ARGUMENT.,"Thus spoke Minerva, and she persuaded his mind for him, unthinking one."
2822,ARGUMENT.,"Straightway he uncased his well-polished bow, made from [the horn of] a"
2823,ARGUMENT.,"wild, bounding goat, which he indeed surprising once on a time in"
2824,ARGUMENT.,"ambush, as it was coming out of a cavern, struck, aiming at it beneath"
2825,ARGUMENT.,the breast; but it fell supine on the rock. Its horns had grown sixteen
2826,ARGUMENT.,"palms from its head; and these the horn-polishing artist, having duly"
2827,ARGUMENT.,"prepared, fitted together, and when he had well smoothed all, added a"
2828,ARGUMENT.,"golden tip. And having bent the bow, he aptly lowered it, having"
2829,ARGUMENT.,inclined it against the ground; but his excellent companions held their
2830,ARGUMENT.,"shields before him, lest the martial sons of the Greeks should rise"
2831,ARGUMENT.,"against him, before warlike Menelaus, the chief of the Greeks, was"
2832,ARGUMENT.,"wounded. Then he drew off the cover of his quiver, and took out an"
2833,ARGUMENT.,"arrow, fresh, winged, a cause of gloomy ills. Forthwith he fitted the"
2834,ARGUMENT.,"bitter arrow to the string, and vowed to Lycian-born Apollo, the"
2835,ARGUMENT.,"renowned archer, that he would sacrifice a splendid hecatomb of"
2836,ARGUMENT.,"firstling lambs, having returned home to the city of sacred Zeleia."
2837,ARGUMENT.,"Having seized them, he drew together the notch [of the arrow] and the"
2838,ARGUMENT.,"ox-hide string; the string, indeed, he brought near to his breast, and"
2839,ARGUMENT.,"the barb to the bow. But after he had bent the great bow into a circle,"
2840,ARGUMENT.,"the bow twanged, the bowstring rang loudly, and the sharp-pointed shaft"
2841,ARGUMENT.,"bounded forth, impatient to wing its flight through the host."
2842,ARGUMENT.,
2843,ARGUMENT.,"Nor did the blessed immortal gods forget thee, O Menelaus; 174 but"
2844,ARGUMENT.,"chiefly the spoil-hunting daughter of Jove, who, standing before thee,"
2845,ARGUMENT.,"averted the deadly weapon. She as much repelled it from thy body, as a"
2846,ARGUMENT.,"mother repels a fly from her infant, when it shall have laid itself"
2847,ARGUMENT.,down in sweet sleep. But she herself guided it to that part where the
2848,ARGUMENT.,"golden clasps of the girdle bound it, and the double-formed corslet"
2849,ARGUMENT.,"met. 175 The bitter arrow fell on his well-fitted belt, and through the"
2850,ARGUMENT.,"deftly-wrought belt was it driven, and it stuck in the variegated"
2851,ARGUMENT.,"corslet and the brazen-plated belt which he wore, the main defence of"
2852,ARGUMENT.,"his body, a guard against weapons, which protect him most; through even"
2853,ARGUMENT.,"this did it pass onwards, and the arrow grazed the surface of the"
2854,ARGUMENT.,"hero’s skin, and straightway black gore flowed from the wound. And as"
2855,ARGUMENT.,"when some Mæonian 176 or Carian woman tinges ivory with purple colour,"
2856,ARGUMENT.,"to be a cheek-trapping for steeds; in her chamber it lies, and many"
2857,ARGUMENT.,"charioteers desire to bear it, but it lies by as an ornament for the"
2858,ARGUMENT.,"king, both as a decoration to the steed, and a glory to the rider: so,"
2859,ARGUMENT.,"Menelaus, were thy well-proportioned thighs, and legs, and fair feet"
2860,ARGUMENT.,"below, stained with gore."
2861,ARGUMENT.,
2862,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 174: (return)  It is elegantly observed by Coleridge, p. 160,"
2863,ARGUMENT.,that “it is principally owing to our sense of the dramatic probability
2864,ARGUMENT.,of the action of the divinities in the Iliad that the heroes do not
2865,ARGUMENT.,"seem dwarfed by their protectors; on the contrary, the manifest"
2866,ARGUMENT.,favourite of the gods stands out in a dilated and more awful shape
2867,ARGUMENT.,"before our imagination, and seems, by the association, to be lifted up"

2878,ARGUMENT.,"But when he saw the string 177 and the barbs still outside, his courage"
2879,ARGUMENT.,"was once more collected in his breast. But Agamemnon, deeply sighing,"
2880,ARGUMENT.,"and holding Menelaus with his hand, spoke thus amidst them, and all his"
2881,ARGUMENT.,companions kept groaning with him:

2886,ARGUMENT.,"“Ο dear brother, now have I ratified a treaty which will prove thy"
2887,ARGUMENT.,"death, exposing thee alone to fight with the Trojans for the Greeks;"
2888,ARGUMENT.,"since the Trojans have thus wounded thee, and trampled on the faithful"
2889,ARGUMENT.,league. But by no means shall the league and the blood of the lambs be
2890,ARGUMENT.,"in vain, and the pure libations, and the right hands in which we"
2891,ARGUMENT.,confided. For even although Olympian Jove has not immediately brought
2892,ARGUMENT.,"them to pass, he will however bring them to pass at last; and at a"
2893,ARGUMENT.,"great price have they paid the penalty, 178 to wit, with their own"
2894,ARGUMENT.,"heads, and their wives and children. For this I know well in mind and"
2895,ARGUMENT.,"soul. A day will be, when sacred Ilium shall perish, and Priam, and the"
2896,ARGUMENT.,"people of ashen-speared Priam; and when Saturnian Jove, lofty-throned,"
2897,ARGUMENT.,"dwelling in the æther, will himself shake his gloomy ægis over all,"
2898,ARGUMENT.,"wrathful on account of this treachery. These things, indeed, shall not"
2899,ARGUMENT.,"be unaccomplished; but to me there will be grief on thy account, O"
2900,ARGUMENT.,"Menelaus, if thou shalt die and fulfil the fate of life; then, indeed,"
2901,ARGUMENT.,"branded with shame, shall I return to much longed-for Argos. For"
2902,ARGUMENT.,"quickly the Greeks will bethink themselves of their fatherland, and we"
2903,ARGUMENT.,"shall leave Argive Helen a boast to Priam and to the Trojans, and the"
2904,ARGUMENT.,"earth will rot thy bones lying in Troy, near to an unfinished work. And"
2905,ARGUMENT.,"thus will some one of the haughty Trojans exclaim, leaping upon the"
2906,ARGUMENT.,tomb of glorious Menelaus: ‘Would that Agamemnon thus wreaked his
2907,ARGUMENT.,"vengeance against all, as even now he has led hither an army of the"
2908,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks in vain, and has now returned home into his dear native land,"
2909,ARGUMENT.,"with empty ships, having left behind him brave Menelaus.’ Thus will"

2919,ARGUMENT.,"variegated belt, and the girdle beneath, and the plate which"

2925,ARGUMENT.,
2926,ARGUMENT.,"He spoke; and thus accosted Talthybius, the divine herald: “Talthybius,"
2927,ARGUMENT.,"summon hither with all speed the hero Machaon, son of the blameless"
2928,ARGUMENT.,"physician Æsculapius, that he may see martial Menelaus, the chief of"
2929,ARGUMENT.,"the Greeks, whom some skilful archer of the Trojans, or of the Lycians,"
2930,ARGUMENT.,"has wounded with a shaft; a glory, indeed, to him, but a grief to us.”"
2931,ARGUMENT.,
2932,ARGUMENT.,He spoke; nor did the herald disobey when he had heard. But he
2933,ARGUMENT.,"proceeded to go through the forces of the brazen-mailed Greeks, looking"
2934,ARGUMENT.,"around for the hero Machaon: him he saw standing, and round him the"
2935,ARGUMENT.,"brave ranks of the shield-bearing hosts, who followed him from"
2936,ARGUMENT.,"steed-nourishing Tricca. Standing near, he spoke winged words:"
2937,ARGUMENT.,
2938,ARGUMENT.,"“Come, O son of Æsculapius, Agamemnon, king of men, calls thee, that"
2939,ARGUMENT.,"thou mayest see martial Menelaus, the son of Atreus, whom some skilful"

2941,ARGUMENT.,"glory indeed to him, but a grief to us.”"
2942,ARGUMENT.,
2943,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke, and incited his soul within his breast. And they"
2944,ARGUMENT.,"proceeded to go through the host, through the wide army of the Greeks;"
2945,ARGUMENT.,but when they had now arrived where fair-haired Menelaus had been
2946,ARGUMENT.,"wounded (but around him were collected as many as were bravest, in a"
2947,ARGUMENT.,"circle, while the godlike hero stood in the midst), instantly thereupon"
2948,ARGUMENT.,he extracted the arrow from the well-fitted belt. But while it was
2949,ARGUMENT.,"being extracted, the sharp barbs were broken. Then he loosed the"
2950,ARGUMENT.,"variegated belt, and the girdle beneath, and the plated belt which"
2951,ARGUMENT.,"brass-workers had forged. But when he perceived the wound, where the"
2952,ARGUMENT.,"bitter shaft had fallen, having sucked out the blood, he skilfully"
2953,ARGUMENT.,"sprinkled on it soothing remedies, 179 which, benevolent Chiron had"
2954,ARGUMENT.,formerly given to his father.

2964,ARGUMENT.,"Whilst they were thus occupied around warlike Menelaus, meantime the"
2965,ARGUMENT.,ranks of the shielded Trojans advanced; and these again put on their

2968,ARGUMENT.,"hastening quickly to the glorious fight. He left his steeds, indeed,"
2969,ARGUMENT.,"and his brass-variegated chariot; and these his servant Eurymedon, son"
2970,ARGUMENT.,"of Ptolymæus, the son of Piräis, held apart panting. Him he strictly"
2971,ARGUMENT.,"enjoined to keep them near him, against the time when weariness should"
2972,ARGUMENT.,"seize his limbs, commanding over many. But he on foot traversed the"
2973,ARGUMENT.,"ranks of the heroes, and whichever of the swift-horsed Greeks he saw"
2974,ARGUMENT.,"hastening, them standing beside, he encouraged with words:"

3000,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he, acting as commander, kept going through the ranks of heroes,"
3001,ARGUMENT.,"and he came to the Cretans, going through the throng of men. But they"
3002,ARGUMENT.,"were armed around warlike Idomeneus. Idomeneus, on his part,"
3003,ARGUMENT.,"[commanded] in the van, like a boar in strength; but Meriones urged on"
3004,ARGUMENT.,"the hindmost phalanxes for him. Seeing these, Agamemnon, the king of"
3005,ARGUMENT.,"men, rejoiced, and instantly accosted Idomeneus, in bland words:"
3006,ARGUMENT.,
3007,ARGUMENT.,"“O Idomeneus, I honour thee, indeed, above the swift-horsed Greeks, as"
3008,ARGUMENT.,"well in war, as in any other work, and at the banquet, when the nobles"
3009,ARGUMENT.,of the Argives mix in their cups the dark-red honourable 181 wine: for
3010,ARGUMENT.,"though the other crested Greeks drink by certain measures, thy cup"
3011,ARGUMENT.,"always stands full, as [mine] to me, that thou mayest drink when thy"
3012,ARGUMENT.,"mind desires it. But hasten into war, such as formerly thou didst boast"
3013,ARGUMENT.,to be.”

3016,ARGUMENT.,
3017,ARGUMENT.,"But him Idomeneus, the leader of the Cretans, in turn answered: “Son of"
3018,ARGUMENT.,"Atreus, a very congenial ally will I be to thee, as first I promised"
3019,ARGUMENT.,and assented. But exhort the other crested Greeks that we may fight
3020,ARGUMENT.,"with all haste, since the Trojans have confounded the league: death and"
3021,ARGUMENT.,"griefs shall be theirs hereafter, since they first offered injury,"
3022,ARGUMENT.,contrary to the league.”
3023,ARGUMENT.,
3024,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke: and the son of Atreus passed on, joyous at heart, and he"
3025,ARGUMENT.,"came to the Ajaces, going through the troops of the heroes. But they"
3026,ARGUMENT.,"were armed, and with them followed a cloud of infantry. As when a"
3027,ARGUMENT.,"goat-herd from a hill-top perceives a cloud traversing the deep,"
3028,ARGUMENT.,"beneath the north-western blast; and to him, standing at a distance, it"
3029,ARGUMENT.,"appears while coming over the ocean, darker than pitch, and brings with"
3030,ARGUMENT.,"it a mighty whirlwind; 182 he both shudders on seeing it, and drives"
3031,ARGUMENT.,"his flock into a cave. Such, with the Ajaces, moved into hostile battle"
3032,ARGUMENT.,"the dense dark phalanxes of Jove-nurtured youths, bristling with"
3033,ARGUMENT.,"shields and spears. And king Agamemnon seeing them, rejoiced, and"
3034,ARGUMENT.,"accosting them, spoke winged words:"

3039,ARGUMENT.,"“Ye Ajaces, leaders of the brazen-mailed Argives, ye two, indeed, for"
3040,ARGUMENT.,"it becomes me not, I in no respect desire to incite; for ye yourselves"
3041,ARGUMENT.,"mightily instigate the people to fight valiantly. Would that, O father"
3042,ARGUMENT.,"Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, such courage were in the breasts of all;"
3043,ARGUMENT.,"soon then would the city of king Priam bend to its fall, taken and"
3044,ARGUMENT.,destroyed by our hands.”
3045,ARGUMENT.,
3046,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having said, he left them there and went to the others; there he"
3047,ARGUMENT.,"found Nestor, the harmonious orator of the Pylians, marshalling his"
3048,ARGUMENT.,"associates, and exhorting them to battle, mighty Pelagon, Alastor,"
3049,ARGUMENT.,"Chromius, and prince Hæmon, and Bias the shepherd of the people. In"
3050,ARGUMENT.,"front, indeed, he placed the cavalry 183 with their horses and"
3051,ARGUMENT.,"chariots, but the foot, both numerous and brave, in the rear, to be the"
3052,ARGUMENT.,"stay of the battle; but the cowards he drove into the middle, that"
3053,ARGUMENT.,"every man, even unwilling, might fight from necessity. At first,"
3054,ARGUMENT.,"indeed, he gave orders to the horsemen; these he commanded to rein in"
3055,ARGUMENT.,"their horses, nor to be confused with the crowd. “And let no person,"
3056,ARGUMENT.,"relying on his skill in horsemanship, and on his strength, desire"
3057,ARGUMENT.,"alone, before the rest, to fight with the Trojans, nor let him retreat:"
3058,ARGUMENT.,"for [if so], ye will be weaker. And whatever man, from his own chariot,"
3059,ARGUMENT.,"can reach that of another, let him stretch out with his spear; 184 for"
3060,ARGUMENT.,so it is much better: for thus the ancients overturned cities and
3061,ARGUMENT.,"walls, keeping this purpose and resolution in their breasts.”"

3067,ARGUMENT.,"chariot, can reach that of another, should commence the attack. This"
3068,ARGUMENT.,was less dangerous than dismounting.
3069,ARGUMENT.,
3070,ARGUMENT.,"Thus the old man, long since well skilled in wars, exhorted them, and"
3071,ARGUMENT.,"king Agamemnon rejoiced when he saw him; and accosting him, spoke"
3072,ARGUMENT.,winged words:
3073,ARGUMENT.,
3074,ARGUMENT.,"“O old man, would that thy knees could so follow thee, and thy strength"
3075,ARGUMENT.,"were firm as is the courage in thy breast. But old age, common alike to"
3076,ARGUMENT.,"all, wearies thee. Would that some other man had thy age, and that thou"
3077,ARGUMENT.,wert amongst the more youthful.”
3078,ARGUMENT.,
3079,ARGUMENT.,"Him then the Gerenian knight Nestor answered: “Son of Atreus, I myself"
3080,ARGUMENT.,"would much wish to be so, as when I killed Eruthalion. But the gods"
3081,ARGUMENT.,never give all things at the same time to men. If I were a young man
3082,ARGUMENT.,"then, now in turn old age invades me. Yet even so, I will be with the"
3083,ARGUMENT.,"horse, and will exhort them with counsel and words: for this is the"
3084,ARGUMENT.,"office of old men. But let the youths, who are younger than I am, and"
3085,ARGUMENT.,"confide in their strength, brandish their spears.”"
3086,ARGUMENT.,
3087,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; and the son of Atreus passed him by, rejoicing at heart."
3088,ARGUMENT.,"Next he found the horseman Menestheus, son of Peteus, standing, and"
3089,ARGUMENT.,around him the Athenians skilled in the war-shout: but crafty Ulysses
3090,ARGUMENT.,stood near; and round him stood the ranks of the Cephallenians not
3091,ARGUMENT.,"feeble; for not yet had the troops of these heard the shout, since"
3092,ARGUMENT.,lately the roused phalanxes of the horse-subduing Trojans and of the
3093,ARGUMENT.,Greeks moved along; but they stood waiting till another division of the
3094,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks, coming on, should charge the Trojans and begin the battle."
3095,ARGUMENT.,"Having seen these, therefore, Agamemnon, the king of men, reproved"
3096,ARGUMENT.,"them, and, accosting them, spoke winged words:"
3097,ARGUMENT.,
3098,ARGUMENT.,"“O son of Peteus, Jove-nurtured king, and thou, accomplished in evil"
3099,ARGUMENT.,"wiles, crafty-minded [Ulysses], why trembling do ye refrain from"
3100,ARGUMENT.,"battle, and wait for others? It became you, indeed, being amongst the"
3101,ARGUMENT.,"first, to stand and meet the ardent battle. For ye are the first"
3102,ARGUMENT.,invited by me to the feast when we Greeks prepare a banquet for the
3103,ARGUMENT.,"chiefs. Then it is pleasant to you to eat the roasted meats, and to"
3104,ARGUMENT.,"quaff cups of sweet wine, as long as ye please. But now would ye in"
3105,ARGUMENT.,"preference be spectators, though ten divisions of the Greeks should"
3106,ARGUMENT.,fight in your presence with the ruthless brass.”
3107,ARGUMENT.,
3108,ARGUMENT.,"But him sternly regarding, crafty Ulysses answered thus: “Son of"
3109,ARGUMENT.,"Atreus, what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth! How canst"
3110,ARGUMENT.,thou say that we are remiss in fighting? Whenever we Greeks stir up
3111,ARGUMENT.,"fierce conflict against the horse-taming Trojans, thou shalt see, if"
3112,ARGUMENT.,"thou desirest, and if these things are a care to thee, the beloved"
3113,ARGUMENT.,father of Telemachus mingled with the foremost of the horse-taming
3114,ARGUMENT.,Trojans. But thou sayest these things rashly.”
3115,ARGUMENT.,
3116,ARGUMENT.,"But him king Agamemnon, when he perceived that he was angry, smiling,"
3117,ARGUMENT.,"addressed, and he retracted his words:"
3118,ARGUMENT.,
3119,ARGUMENT.,"“Noble son of Laertes, much-contriving Ulysses, I neither chide thee in"
3120,ARGUMENT.,"terms above measure, nor exhort thee. For I am aware that thy mind in"
3121,ARGUMENT.,thy breast kens friendly counsels: for thou thinkest the same that I
3122,ARGUMENT.,"do. But come, we shall settle these disputes at a future time, should"
3123,ARGUMENT.,anything evil have now been uttered. But may the gods render all these
3124,ARGUMENT.,things vain.”
3125,ARGUMENT.,
3126,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having spoken, he left them there, and went to others; he found"
3127,ARGUMENT.,"magnanimous Diomede, son of Tydeus, standing by his horses and"
3128,ARGUMENT.,"brass-mounted 185 chariot. Near him stood Sthenelus, son of Capaneus."
3129,ARGUMENT.,"And having seen him too, king Agamemnon reproved him, and accosting him"
3130,ARGUMENT.,"thus, spoke winged words:"
3131,ARGUMENT.,
3132,ARGUMENT.,"“Alas! O son of warlike horse-breaking Tydeus, why dost thou tremble?"
3133,ARGUMENT.,Why dost thou explore the intervals of the ranks? 186 It was not with
3134,ARGUMENT.,"Tydeus thus customary to tremble, but to fight with the enemy far"
3135,ARGUMENT.,"before his dear companions. So they have said, who beheld him toiling:"
3136,ARGUMENT.,"for I never met, nor have I beheld him: but they say that he excelled"
3137,ARGUMENT.,all others. For certainly with godlike Polynices he entered Mycenæ
3138,ARGUMENT.,"without warlike array, a guest, collecting forces: they 187 were then"
3139,ARGUMENT.,"preparing an expedition against the sacred walls of Thebes, and"
3140,ARGUMENT.,supplicated much that they would give renowned auxiliaries. But they
3141,ARGUMENT.,"[the Mycenæans] were willing to give them, and approved of it, as they"
3142,ARGUMENT.,"urged; but Jove changed [their design], showing unpropitious omens."
3143,ARGUMENT.,"But, after they departed, and proceeded on their way, they came to"
3144,ARGUMENT.,"rushy, grassy Asopus. Then the Achæans sent Tydeus upon an embassy. 188"
3145,ARGUMENT.,"Accordingly he went, and found many Cadmeans feasting in the palace of"
3146,ARGUMENT.,"brave Eteocles. Then the knight Tydeus, though being a stranger, feared"
3147,ARGUMENT.,"not, being alone amongst many Cadmeans: but challenged them to contend"
3148,ARGUMENT.,"[in games], and easily conquered in all, so mighty a second was Minerva"
3149,ARGUMENT.,"to him. But the Cadmeans, goaders of steeds, being enraged, leading"
3150,ARGUMENT.,"fifty youths, laid a crafty ambuscade for him returning: but there were"
3151,ARGUMENT.,"two leaders, Mæon, son of Hæmon, like unto the immortals, and"
3152,ARGUMENT.,"Lycophontes, persevering in fight, the son of Autophonus. Tydeus,"
3153,ARGUMENT.,"however, brought cruel death upon them. He killed them all, but sent"
3154,ARGUMENT.,"one only to return home: for he dismissed Mæon, obeying the portents of"
3155,ARGUMENT.,"the gods. Such was Ætolian Tydeus. But he begat a son, inferior to"
3156,ARGUMENT.,"himself in battle, but superior in council.”"

3170,ARGUMENT.,
3171,ARGUMENT.,"But him the son of renowned Capaneus answered: “Son of Atreus, lie not,"
3172,ARGUMENT.,"knowing how to tell truth. We, indeed, boast to be far better than our"
3173,ARGUMENT.,"fathers. We too have taken the citadel of seven-gated Thebes, leading"
3174,ARGUMENT.,"fewer troops under the wall sacred to Mars, confiding in the portents"
3175,ARGUMENT.,"of the gods, and in the aid of Jove: but they perished through their"
3176,ARGUMENT.,"own infatuation. Wherefore, never place my ancestors in the same rank"
3177,ARGUMENT.,with me.”
3178,ARGUMENT.,
3179,ARGUMENT.,"Him sternly regarding, brave Diomede accosted thus: “My friend 189"

3181,ARGUMENT.,"Agamemnon, the shepherd of the people, for thus exhorting the"
3182,ARGUMENT.,"well-greaved Greeks to fight. Glory shall attend him, if, indeed, the"
3183,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks shall conquer the Trojans, and take sacred Ilium; but great"
3184,ARGUMENT.,"grief shall be his, on the other hand, the Greeks being cut off. But"
3185,ARGUMENT.,"come now, and let us be mindful of impetuous valour.”"

3194,ARGUMENT.,
3195,ARGUMENT.,As when on the loud-resounding shore a wave of the sea is impelled in
3196,ARGUMENT.,continuous succession beneath the north-west wind which has set it in
3197,ARGUMENT.,"motion; at first indeed it raises itself aloft in the deep, but then"
3198,ARGUMENT.,"dashed against the land, it roars mightily; and being swollen it rises"
3199,ARGUMENT.,"high around the projecting points, and spits from it the foam of the"
3200,ARGUMENT.,sea: thus then the thick phalanxes of the Greeks moved incessantly on
3201,ARGUMENT.,to battle. Each leader commanded his own troops. The rest went in
3202,ARGUMENT.,"silence (nor would you have said that so numerous an army followed,"
3203,ARGUMENT.,"having the power of speech in their breasts), silently reverencing"
3204,ARGUMENT.,their leaders. And around them all their arms of various workmanship
3205,ARGUMENT.,"shone brightly; clad with which, they proceeded in order. But the"
3206,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans, as the sheep of a rich man stand countless in the fold, whilst"
3207,ARGUMENT.,"they are milked of their white milk, continually bleating, having heard"
3208,ARGUMENT.,the voice of their lambs—thus was the clamour of the Trojans excited
3209,ARGUMENT.,"through the wide army. For there was not the same shout of all, nor the"
3210,ARGUMENT.,"same voice, but their language was mixed, for the men were called from"
3211,ARGUMENT.,"many climes. These Mars urged on, but those blue-eyed Minerva, 190 and"
3212,ARGUMENT.,"Terror, and Rout, and Strife, insatiably raging, the sister and"
3213,ARGUMENT.,"attendant of homicide Mars, she raises her head, small indeed at first,"
3214,ARGUMENT.,"but afterwards she has fixed her head in heaven, and stalks along the"
3215,ARGUMENT.,"earth. Then also she, going through the crowd, increasing the groaning"

3231,ARGUMENT.,shouts of men slaying and being slain; and the earth flowed with blood.
3232,ARGUMENT.,"As when wintry torrents flowing down from the mountains, mix in a basin"
3233,ARGUMENT.,"the impetuous water from their great springs in a hollow ravine, and"

3237,ARGUMENT.,"Antilochus first killed a Trojan warrior, Echepolus, son of Thalysias,"

3240,ARGUMENT.,"the bone, and darkness veiled his eyes; and he fell, like a tower, in"
3241,ARGUMENT.,"fierce conflict. Him fallen, king Elephenor, the offspring of"
3242,ARGUMENT.,"Chalcodon, chief of the magnanimous Abantes, seized by the feet, and"
3243,ARGUMENT.,"was drawing him beyond the reach of darts in haste, that with all haste"
3244,ARGUMENT.,he might despoil him of his armour: but that attempt was short; for
3245,ARGUMENT.,"magnanimous Agenor having descried him dragging the body, wounded him"
3246,ARGUMENT.,"with a brazen spear in the side, which, as he stooped, appeared from"
3247,ARGUMENT.,"beneath the covert of his shield, and he relaxed his limbs [in death]."
3248,ARGUMENT.,His soul therefore left him. But over him arose a fierce conflict of
3249,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans and of Greeks. But they like wolves rushed on each other, and"
3250,ARGUMENT.,man bore down man. Then Telamonian Ajax smote the blooming youth
3251,ARGUMENT.,"Simoïsius, son of Anthemion, whom formerly his mother, descending from"
3252,ARGUMENT.,"Ida, brought forth on the banks of Simois, when, to wit, she followed"
3253,ARGUMENT.,her parents to view the flocks; wherefore they called him Simoïsius.
3254,ARGUMENT.,"Nor did he repay to his dear parents the price of his early nurture,"
3255,ARGUMENT.,"for his life was short, he being slain with a spear by magnanimous"
3256,ARGUMENT.,"Ajax. For him advancing first, he [Ajax] struck on the breast, near the"
3257,ARGUMENT.,right pap: and the brazen spear passed out through his shoulder on the
3258,ARGUMENT.,"opposite side. He fell on the ground in the dust, like a poplar, winch"
3259,ARGUMENT.,"has sprung up in the moist grass-land of an extensive marsh,—branches"
3260,ARGUMENT.,"grow smooth, yet upon the very top, which the chariot-maker lops with"
3261,ARGUMENT.,"the shining steel, that he might bend [it as] a felloe for a beauteous"
3262,ARGUMENT.,"chariot. Drying, it lies indeed on the banks of the river. So did the"
3263,ARGUMENT.,"high-born Ajax spoil Simoïsius, the descendant of Anthemion. But at him"
3264,ARGUMENT.,"Antiphus, of the varied corslet, the son of Priam, took aim through the"
3265,ARGUMENT.,"crowd with a sharp spear. From whom, indeed, it erred: but he struck"
3266,ARGUMENT.,"Leucus, the faithful companion of Ulysses, in the groin, as he was"
3267,ARGUMENT.,"drawing the body aside; but he fell near it, and the body dropped from"
3268,ARGUMENT.,"his hand. For him slain, Ulysses was much enraged in mind; and he"
3269,ARGUMENT.,"rushed through the van, armed in shining brass; and advancing very"
3270,ARGUMENT.,"near, he stood, and casting his eyes all around him, hurled with his"
3271,ARGUMENT.,"glittering spear. But the Trojans retired in confusion, as the hero"
3272,ARGUMENT.,"hurled; he did not, however, hurl the spear in vain, but struck"
3273,ARGUMENT.,"Democoon, the spurious son of Priam, who came from Abydos, from"
3274,ARGUMENT.,"[tending] the swift mares. 191 Him Ulysses, enraged for his companion,"
3275,ARGUMENT.,"struck with his spear in the temple, and the brazen point penetrated"
3276,ARGUMENT.,"through the other temple, and darkness veiled his eyes. Falling he made"
3277,ARGUMENT.,"a crash, and his arms resounded upon him. Both the foremost bands and"
3278,ARGUMENT.,"illustrious Hector fell back. The Argives shouted aloud, and dragged"
3279,ARGUMENT.,the bodies away: then they rushed farther forward; and Apollo was
3280,ARGUMENT.,"enraged, looking down from Pergamus; and, shouting out, exhorted the"
3281,ARGUMENT.,Trojans:

3299,ARGUMENT.,struck him. The reckless stone entirely crushed both tendons and bones;
3300,ARGUMENT.,"supine in the dust he fell, stretching forth both hands to his dear"

3302,ARGUMENT.,"ran up, and pierced him in the navel with his spear; and thereupon all"

3304,ARGUMENT.,eyes.
3305,ARGUMENT.,
3306,ARGUMENT.,"But him 192 Ætolian Thoas struck, rushing on with his spear, in the"

3309,ARGUMENT.,"unsheathed his sharp sword, and with it smote him in the midst of the"
3310,ARGUMENT.,"belly, and took away his life. But he did not spoil him of his armour,"
3311,ARGUMENT.,"for his companions stood round him, the hair-tufted Thracians, holding"
3312,ARGUMENT.,"long spears in their hands, who drove him from them, though being"
3313,ARGUMENT.,"mighty, and valiant, and glorious; but he, retreating, was repulsed"
3314,ARGUMENT.,with force. Thus these two were stretched in the dust near to each
3315,ARGUMENT.,"other; Pirus, indeed, the leader of the Thracians, and Diores, the"
3316,ARGUMENT.,leader of the brazen-mailed Epeans; and many others also were slain
3317,ARGUMENT.,around.
3318,ARGUMENT.,
3319,ARGUMENT.,"Then no longer could any man, having come into the field, find fault"
3320,ARGUMENT.,"with the action, who, even as yet neither wounded from distant blows,"

3364,ARGUMENT.,"Now there was amongst the Trojans one Dares, rich, blameless, the"
3365,ARGUMENT.,"priest of Vulcan; and he had two sons, Phegeus and Idæus, well skilled"
3366,ARGUMENT.,"in all kinds of battle: these twain, apart [from their companions],"
3367,ARGUMENT.,"rushed to meet [Diomede]; they on their part, from their two-horse"
3368,ARGUMENT.,"chariot, but he, from the ground, made the attack on foot. When these,"
3369,ARGUMENT.,"therefore, advancing against each other, were now near, Phegeus first"
3370,ARGUMENT.,"hurled forth his long-shadowed spear, and the point of the spear went"
3371,ARGUMENT.,"over the left shoulder of the son of Tydeus, nor did it strike him. But"
3372,ARGUMENT.,the son of Tydeus next rushed on with his brazen javelin; nor did the
3373,ARGUMENT.,"weapon fly in vain from his hand, but struck his [Phegeus’s] breast"
3374,ARGUMENT.,"between the paps, and forced him from his chariot. Then Idæus leaped"
3375,ARGUMENT.,"down, having left the very beautiful chariot, nor ventured to protect"
3376,ARGUMENT.,"his slain brother. [In vain,] for not even he would have escaped gloomy"
3377,ARGUMENT.,"fate, but Vulcan snatched him away, and saved him, having enveloped him"
3378,ARGUMENT.,"in darkness, that the old man might not be altogether sad. But the son"
3379,ARGUMENT.,"of magnanimous Tydeus having taken the horses, gave them to his"
3380,ARGUMENT.,companions to lead to the hollow ships. When the magnanimous Trojans
3381,ARGUMENT.,"beheld the sons of Dares, the one 196 flying, the other slain at the"
3382,ARGUMENT.,"chariot, the hearts of all were discomfited. But azure-eyed Minerva,"
3383,ARGUMENT.,"seizing him by the hand, thus addressed impetuous Mars: “Mars, Mars,"
3384,ARGUMENT.,"man-slayer, gore-stained, stormer of walls, should we not suffer the"
3385,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans and the Greeks to fight, to which side soever father Jove may"
3386,ARGUMENT.,"give glory; but let us retire, and avoid the wrath of Jove?”"
3387,ARGUMENT.,
3388,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having said, she led impetuous Mars from the battle, and"
3389,ARGUMENT.,afterwards seated him on grassy 197 Scamander. Then the Greeks turned
3390,ARGUMENT.,"the Trojans to flight, and each of the leaders slew his man. First"
3391,ARGUMENT.,"Agamemnon, king of men, hurled from his chariot huge Hodius, chief of"
3392,ARGUMENT.,"the Halizonians. For in the back of him first turned [in flight],"
3393,ARGUMENT.,"between his shoulders he fixed the spear, and drove it through his"
3394,ARGUMENT.,"breast; and falling, he made a crash, and his arms resounded upon him."
3395,ARGUMENT.,
3396,ARGUMENT.,"But next Idomeneus killed Phæstus, the son of Mæonian Borus, who had"

3443,ARGUMENT.,"Phyleus, on his part, coming near, smote on the back of the head with"

3450,ARGUMENT.,"illustrious son of Evæmon, struck in the shoulder in his flight,"
3451,ARGUMENT.,"rushing on with his sword, and cut off his heavy hand: then the gory"
3452,ARGUMENT.,hand fell in the field; but blood-red death and stern fate seized his
3453,ARGUMENT.,eyes.
3454,ARGUMENT.,
3455,ARGUMENT.,Thus they on their part laboured in the violent fight. But you would
3456,ARGUMENT.,"not have known the son of Tydeus, to which side he belonged, whether he"
3457,ARGUMENT.,was mixed with the Trojans or with the Greeks. For he rushed through
3458,ARGUMENT.,"the plain, like unto a river swollen by mountain-streams, which flowing"
3459,ARGUMENT.,"rapidly throws down bridges: and this, neither the fortified dams can"
3460,ARGUMENT.,"restrain, nor the fences of the richly-blooming fields check, as it"
3461,ARGUMENT.,"comes suddenly, when the rain-storm of Jove bears down heavily: many"
3462,ARGUMENT.,hopeful works of vigorous youths are wont to fall by it. Thus by the
3463,ARGUMENT.,son of Tydeus were the close phalanxes of the Trojans thrown into
3464,ARGUMENT.,"confusion; nor did they withstand him, although being numerous."
3465,ARGUMENT.,
3466,ARGUMENT.,"When, therefore, Pandarus, the illustrious son of Lycaon, saw him"
3467,ARGUMENT.,"rushing through the field, discomfiting the phalanxes before him, he"
3468,ARGUMENT.,"drew his crooked bow, and smote him rushing on, striking him upon the"
3469,ARGUMENT.,right shoulder [on] the cavity of the corslet: the bitter shaft flew on
3470,ARGUMENT.,and broke through to the other side; and the corslet was stained with
3471,ARGUMENT.,blood. Whereupon the illustrious son of Lycaon exclaimed aloud:
3472,ARGUMENT.,
3473,ARGUMENT.,"“Rush on, ye magnanimous Trojans, spurrers of steeds, for the bravest"
3474,ARGUMENT.,of the Greeks is wounded; nor do I think that he will long endure the
3475,ARGUMENT.,"violent arrow, if king Apollo, the son of Jove, really urged me"
3476,ARGUMENT.,proceeding from Lycia.”
3477,ARGUMENT.,
3478,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke, vaunting; but him [Diomede] the swift arrow did not"
3479,ARGUMENT.,"subdue: but having retreated, he stood before his horses and chariot,"
3480,ARGUMENT.,"and thus accosted Sthenelus, son of Capaneus:"
3481,ARGUMENT.,
3482,ARGUMENT.,"“Haste, dear son of Capaneus, descend from thy chariot, that thou"
3483,ARGUMENT.,mayest draw from my shoulder the bitter shaft.”
3484,ARGUMENT.,
3485,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke, and Sthenelus leaped from his chariot to the ground,"
3486,ARGUMENT.,"and, standing by him, drew the swift, deeply-piercing arrow forth from"
3487,ARGUMENT.,"his shoulder, and the blood spurted out through the twisted mail. Then"
3488,ARGUMENT.,"Diomede, brave in battle, prayed:"
3489,ARGUMENT.,
3490,ARGUMENT.,"“Hear me, O daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, unwearied, if ever"
3491,ARGUMENT.,"favouring thou stoodest by me and my sire in the hostile fight, now in"
3492,ARGUMENT.,"turn befriend me, O Minerva. And grant me to slay this man, and that he"
3493,ARGUMENT.,"may approach within the aim of my spear, who being beforehand has"
3494,ARGUMENT.,"struck me, and boasts, and says that I shall not long behold the"
3495,ARGUMENT.,brilliant light of the sun.”
3496,ARGUMENT.,
3497,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke, praying, and Pallas Minerva heard him, and made light"
3498,ARGUMENT.,"his limbs, his feet, and his hands above, and standing near him, spoke"
3499,ARGUMENT.,winged words:
3500,ARGUMENT.,
3501,ARGUMENT.,"“With confidence, now, O Diomede, fight against the Trojans; for into"
3502,ARGUMENT.,"thy soul have I sent that intrepid ancestral might, such as the"
3503,ARGUMENT.,shield-brandishing knight Tydeus was wont to possess: and moreover I
3504,ARGUMENT.,"have taken away the darkness from thine eyes, which before was upon"
3505,ARGUMENT.,"them, that thou mayest discern a god and also a man. Wherefore now, if"
3506,ARGUMENT.,"any divinity come hither, making trial of thee, do thou by no means"
3507,ARGUMENT.,"fight against any other immortal gods; but if Venus, daughter of Jove,"
3508,ARGUMENT.,"should come into battle, wound her at all events with the sharp brass.”"
3509,ARGUMENT.,
3510,ARGUMENT.,"Thus on her part having spoken, azure-eyed Minerva departed: but the"
3511,ARGUMENT.,"son of Tydeus, returning again, was mixed with the van; and ardent as"
3512,ARGUMENT.,"he before was in spirit to fight against the Trojans, then, indeed,"
3513,ARGUMENT.,"thrice as much courage possessed him. Like as a lion, whom the shepherd"
3514,ARGUMENT.,"in the country, by his fleecy sheep, has grazed indeed, while"
3515,ARGUMENT.,"overleaping the court-yard, but has not killed; he [the shepherd] has"
3516,ARGUMENT.,"merely roused his ardour; but afterwards he ventures no farther aid,"
3517,ARGUMENT.,"but on the contrary retires within the fold, while the sheep, deserted,"
3518,ARGUMENT.,"fly in consternation. These, indeed, are huddled in masses one upon"
3519,ARGUMENT.,"another, but he [the lion] leaps joyfully from the lofty fold. 201 So"
3520,ARGUMENT.,was brave Diomede joyfully mixed with the Trojans.
3521,ARGUMENT.,
3522,ARGUMENT.,"Then he slew Astynoüs, and Hypenor the shepherd of the people: having"
3523,ARGUMENT.,"smote the one above the pap with the brazen lance, but the other he"
3524,ARGUMENT.,"smote with his huge sword on the collar-bone at the shoulder, and"
3525,ARGUMENT.,"separated the shoulder from the neck and back. These, indeed, he left,"
3526,ARGUMENT.,"but rushed on Abas and Polyïdus, the sons of Eurydamas, the aged"
3527,ARGUMENT.,"interpreter of dreams; to whom going to the war, the old man did not"
3528,ARGUMENT.,interpret their dreams; but brave Diomede spoiled them when slain. Then
3529,ARGUMENT.,"he went against Xanthus and Thoon, the sons of Phænops, both dearly"
3530,ARGUMENT.,"cherished; 202 but he was worn by sad old age, and did not beget"
3531,ARGUMENT.,"another son to leave over his possessions. These, then, Diomede slew,"
3532,ARGUMENT.,"and took their life from both, but to their father left grief and"
3533,ARGUMENT.,"mournful cares, since he did not receive them returning alive from"
3534,ARGUMENT.,battle; but his next of kin 203 divided the inheritance amongst them.

3543,ARGUMENT.,
3544,ARGUMENT.,"Then he seized Echemon and Chromius, two sons of Dardanian Priam, being"
3545,ARGUMENT.,"in one chariot. As when a lion, leaping amidst the herd, has broken the"
3546,ARGUMENT.,neck of a heifer or of an ox pasturing in a thicket; so did the son of
3547,ARGUMENT.,Tydeus forcibly dislodge them both from the chariot against their
3548,ARGUMENT.,"wills, and then spoiled them of their arms. But the steeds he gave to"
3549,ARGUMENT.,"his companions, to drive to the ships."
3550,ARGUMENT.,
3551,ARGUMENT.,"But him Æneas beheld devastating the ranks of men, and he hastened to"
3552,ARGUMENT.,"go both through the battle and the din of spears, seeking godlike"
3553,ARGUMENT.,"Pandarus, if anywhere he might find him. He found the blameless and"
3554,ARGUMENT.,"valiant son of Lycaon, and stood before him, and spoke [this] word to"
3555,ARGUMENT.,him:
3556,ARGUMENT.,
3557,ARGUMENT.,"“O Pandarus, where are thy bow and thy winged shafts, and thy renown,"
3558,ARGUMENT.,"with which no man here at least contends with thee, nor does any person"
3559,ARGUMENT.,"in Lycia boast to be braver than thou? But come, having raised thy"
3560,ARGUMENT.,"hands to Jove, aim an arrow against this man, (whoever he be, who is"
3561,ARGUMENT.,"thus prevailing, and who has already wrought many ills against the"
3562,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans, since he has relaxed the knees of many and of brave), unless"
3563,ARGUMENT.,"he be some god, wrathful against the Trojans, angry on account of"
3564,ARGUMENT.,sacrifices [not offered]: and unless the severe wrath of a deity be
3565,ARGUMENT.,upon us.”
3566,ARGUMENT.,
3567,ARGUMENT.,"Him the illustrious son of Lycaon answered in turn: “Æneas, counsellor"
3568,ARGUMENT.,"of the brazen-mailed Trojans, I assimilate him in all respects to the"
3569,ARGUMENT.,"warlike son of Tydeus, recognizing him by his shield and oblong helmet,"
3570,ARGUMENT.,and looking on his steeds: but I do not know certainly whether he be a
3571,ARGUMENT.,"god. But if this man, whom I speak of, be the warlike son of Tydeus, he"
3572,ARGUMENT.,"does not perform these frantic deeds without divine aid, but some one"
3573,ARGUMENT.,"of the immortals stands near, wrapped round as to his shoulders 204 in"
3574,ARGUMENT.,"a cloud, who has turned into another course the swift shaft just about"
3575,ARGUMENT.,"to hit him. For but just now I aimed an arrow at him, and struck him on"
3576,ARGUMENT.,"the right shoulder, entirely through the cavity of his corslet; and I"
3577,ARGUMENT.,thought I should hurl him down to Pluto; yet did I not altogether
3578,ARGUMENT.,"subdue him; some god, of a truth, is wrathful. And steeds and chariots"
3579,ARGUMENT.,"are not present, which I might ascend: but somewhere in the palaces of"
3580,ARGUMENT.,"Lycaon [are] eleven chariots, beautiful, newly-built, lately made:"
3581,ARGUMENT.,coverings are spread around them: and beside each of them stand steeds
3582,ARGUMENT.,"yoked in pairs, eating white barley and wheat. Of a truth the aged"
3583,ARGUMENT.,"warrior Lycaon gave me, on setting out, very many commands in his"
3584,ARGUMENT.,"well-built palaces: he ordered me, having ascended my steeds and my"
3585,ARGUMENT.,"chariot, to command the Trojans in the fierce conflicts; but I heeded"
3586,ARGUMENT.,"him not (and truly it would have been much better), sparing my steeds,"
3587,ARGUMENT.,"lest they, accustomed to feed largely, should want food, to my cost, 205"
3588,ARGUMENT.,the men being shut up [in the city]. Thus I left them; but I have come
3589,ARGUMENT.,"on foot to Troy, relying on my bow and arrows, but these were not"
3590,ARGUMENT.,"destined to profit me. For lately I aimed [a shaft] at two chiefs, at"
3591,ARGUMENT.,"the son of Tydeus and the son of Atreus; and having struck, I drew"
3592,ARGUMENT.,"blood manifestly from both; but I roused them the more. Therefore, with"
3593,ARGUMENT.,"evil fate I took down my curved bow from the peg, on that day when I"
3594,ARGUMENT.,"led the Trojans to pleasant Ilium, doing a favour to divine Hector. But"
3595,ARGUMENT.,"if I shall return, and shall with these eyes behold my country, and my"
3596,ARGUMENT.,"wife, and my lofty-roofed great palace, immediately may some hostile"
3597,ARGUMENT.,"man cut off my head, if I do not put this bow into the shining fire,"
3598,ARGUMENT.,having broken it with my hands; for it attends on me to no purpose.”

3606,ARGUMENT.,"not so: but it will not be otherwise, before that we twain, with horses"
3607,ARGUMENT.,"and chariot, going against this man, make trial of him with arms. But"
3608,ARGUMENT.,"come, ascend my chariot; that thou mayest see of what kind are the"
3609,ARGUMENT.,"steeds of Tros, skilful in the plain to pursue rapidly here and there,"
3610,ARGUMENT.,"and to retreat; they also shall bring us safe again to the city, if"
3611,ARGUMENT.,"Jove will a second time afford glory to Diomede, the son of Tydeus. But"
3612,ARGUMENT.,"come, take the whip now, and the shining reins, and I will descend from"
3613,ARGUMENT.,"the chariot, that I may fight; or do thou await this man, and the"
3614,ARGUMENT.,steeds shall be my care.”
3615,ARGUMENT.,
3616,ARGUMENT.,"Him then the illustrious son of Lycaon answered in turn: “Æneas, do"
3617,ARGUMENT.,thou thyself hold the reins and thy own steeds: the better will they
3618,ARGUMENT.,"bear along the curved chariot under their accustomed charioteer, if we"
3619,ARGUMENT.,"shall fly back from the son of Tydeus; lest they, taking fright, should"
3620,ARGUMENT.,"become restive, and be unwilling to bear us away from the war, missing"
3621,ARGUMENT.,"thy voice, and the son of magnanimous Tydeus, rushing on us, should"
3622,ARGUMENT.,"slay ourselves, and drive away thy solid-hoofed steeds. But do thou"
3623,ARGUMENT.,"thyself drive the chariot and thy own steeds, but with my sharp spear"
3624,ARGUMENT.,will I receive him advancing.”
3625,ARGUMENT.,
3626,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having said, ascending the variegated chariot, they directed the"
3627,ARGUMENT.,"swift steeds impetuously against the son of Tydeus. But Sthenelus, the"
3628,ARGUMENT.,"illustrious son of Capaneus, perceived them, and immediately to the son"
3629,ARGUMENT.,of Tydeus he spoke winged words:
3630,ARGUMENT.,
3631,ARGUMENT.,"“Diomede, son of Tydeus, most dear to my soul, I perceive two valiant"
3632,ARGUMENT.,"men eager to fight against thee, possessing immense might; one, indeed,"
3633,ARGUMENT.,"well-skilled in the bow, 206 Pandarus, and moreover he boasts to be the"
3634,ARGUMENT.,"son of Lycaon, and Æneas, [who] boasts to be born the son of"
3635,ARGUMENT.,"magnanimous Anchises; but Venus is his mother. But come, let us now"
3636,ARGUMENT.,"retire, having ascended our horses, nor thus, I pray thee, run"
3637,ARGUMENT.,"furiously through the van, lest thou shouldst lose thy dear life.”"
3638,ARGUMENT.,
3639,ARGUMENT.,"But him sternly regarding, brave Diomede thus addressed: “Talk not to"
3640,ARGUMENT.,"me of retreat, 207 since I think thou wilt not persuade me. It becomes"
3641,ARGUMENT.,"not my nature to fight in a skulking manner, nor to tremble; as yet my"
3642,ARGUMENT.,"strength is unimpaired. I am averse to mount the chariot, but even as I"
3643,ARGUMENT.,am will I advance to meet them: spear-brandishing Minerva does not
3644,ARGUMENT.,suffer me to tremble. Never shall the swift horses bear these twain
3645,ARGUMENT.,"both back again from us, supposing even one of them shall escape. But"
3646,ARGUMENT.,"another thing I tell thee, and do thou lay it up in thy soul, if most"
3647,ARGUMENT.,"prudent Minerva should grant me the glory to kill both, then do thou"
3648,ARGUMENT.,"detain here these swift steeds, stretching forth the reins from the"
3649,ARGUMENT.,"rim, and, mindful, rush upon the horses of Æneas, and drive them from"
3650,ARGUMENT.,the Trojans to the well-greaved Greeks. For they are of that breed
3651,ARGUMENT.,which far-seeing Jove gave as a price to Tros for his son Ganymede;
3652,ARGUMENT.,"wherefore they are the best of steeds, as many as are under the east"
3653,ARGUMENT.,"and the sun. From this breed Anchises, king of men, stole them, having"
3654,ARGUMENT.,supplied mares without the knowledge of Laomedon: of the breed of these
3655,ARGUMENT.,"six were foaled in his courts. Reserving four himself, he nourished"
3656,ARGUMENT.,"them at the manger, and two, skilled in rousing terror, he gave to"

3665,ARGUMENT.,
3666,ARGUMENT.,Thus they were speaking such things to each other; but the others soon
3667,ARGUMENT.,"drew near, urging onward their swift steeds. The illustrious son of"
3668,ARGUMENT.,Lycaon first accosted Diomede:
3669,ARGUMENT.,
3670,ARGUMENT.,"“Stout-hearted, warlike-minded, son of illustrious Tydeus, certainly my"
3671,ARGUMENT.,"swift shaft, my bitter arrow has not slain thee. Now again will I try"
3672,ARGUMENT.,"with my spear, whether I can hit my mark.” 208"
3673,ARGUMENT.,
3674,ARGUMENT.,"He said, and brandishing [it], he sent forth his long-shadowed spear,"
3675,ARGUMENT.,and struck the shield of Tydides: but the brazen spear flying straight
3676,ARGUMENT.,"through, approached the corslet. Then the son of Lycaon shouted loudly"
3677,ARGUMENT.,over him:
3678,ARGUMENT.,
3679,ARGUMENT.,"“Thou art wounded in the flank, through and through, nor do I think"
3680,ARGUMENT.,thou wilt endure it much longer: but to me hast thou given great
3681,ARGUMENT.,glory.”
3682,ARGUMENT.,
3683,ARGUMENT.,"But him the valiant son of Tydeus, undisturbed, addressed: “Thou hast"
3684,ARGUMENT.,"erred, nor hast thou reached thine aim; 209 but I certainly think thou"
3685,ARGUMENT.,"wilt not cease, till one of you at least, having fallen, shall satiate"
3686,ARGUMENT.,"Mars, the warrior of the bull’s-hide shield, with his blood.”"

3692,ARGUMENT.,
3693,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having spoken, he hurled forth [his lance], and Minerva directed"
3694,ARGUMENT.,"the weapon to his nose, near the eye; and it passed quite through his"
3695,ARGUMENT.,"white teeth: and then unwearied, the brass cut the root of his tongue,"
3696,ARGUMENT.,and the point came out at the bottom of his chin. From his chariot he
3697,ARGUMENT.,"fell, and his variegated, shining 210 arms resounded upon him; but his"
3698,ARGUMENT.,"swift-footed steeds started aside through fright, and there were his"
3699,ARGUMENT.,soul and strength dissolved. Æneas then bounded down with his shield
3700,ARGUMENT.,"and long spear, fearing lest the Greeks by any means should take the"
3701,ARGUMENT.,"body away from him. He walked round it, therefore, like a lion,"
3702,ARGUMENT.,"confiding in his strength: and before him he stretched out his lance,"
3703,ARGUMENT.,"and his shield equal on all sides, shouting dreadfully, eager to slay"
3704,ARGUMENT.,"him, whoever might come against him. But the son of Tydeus seized in"
3705,ARGUMENT.,"his grasp a hand-stone, a huge affair, such as no two men could carry,"
3706,ARGUMENT.,such at least as mortals are now; but he even alone easily wielded it.
3707,ARGUMENT.,"With it he struck Æneas on the hip, where the thigh is turned in the"
3708,ARGUMENT.,"hip;—they call it the socket;—the socket he smote violently, and broke"
3709,ARGUMENT.,"besides both tendons, and the rugged stone tore off the skin. But the"
3710,ARGUMENT.,"hero having fallen on his knees, remained so, and supported himself"
3711,ARGUMENT.,"with his strong hand upon the ground, and dark night veiled his eyes."
3712,ARGUMENT.,

3716,ARGUMENT.,"And there, of a truth, Æneas, the king of men, had perished, unless"
3717,ARGUMENT.,"Venus, the daughter of Jove, had quickly perceived him, his mother, who"
3718,ARGUMENT.,brought him forth to Anchises as he fed his oxen; 211 but around her
3719,ARGUMENT.,"own dear son she spread her white arms, and before him she extended the"
3720,ARGUMENT.,"folds of her shining robe, as a fence against arrows, lest any of the"
3721,ARGUMENT.,"swift-horsed Greeks having cast the steel into his breast, should take"
3722,ARGUMENT.,"away his life. She, indeed, stealthily bore off her beloved son from"
3723,ARGUMENT.,the battle. Nor was the son of Capaneus forgetful of those commands
3724,ARGUMENT.,which warlike Diomede gave him: but he detained his own solid-hoofed
3725,ARGUMENT.,"steeds apart from the tumult, having stretched forth the reins from the"
3726,ARGUMENT.,"rim; and rushing forward, drove from the Trojans to the well-greaved"
3727,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks the beautiful-maned steeds of Æneas, and gave them to Deipylus,"
3728,ARGUMENT.,"his beloved companion (whom he honoured above all his coevals, because"
3729,ARGUMENT.,"he possessed in his mind sentiments congenial with himself), to drive"
3730,ARGUMENT.,"them to the hollow ships: but the hero himself, having ascended his"
3731,ARGUMENT.,"chariot, took the splendid reins; and instantly drove his solid-hoofed"
3732,ARGUMENT.,steeds after the son of Tydeus with ardour; but Diomede pursued Venus
3733,ARGUMENT.,"with the cruel steel, 212 knowing that she was an unwarlike goddess,"
3734,ARGUMENT.,"nor [one] of those goddesses who administer the war of men, neither"
3735,ARGUMENT.,"Minerva, nor city-destroying Bellona. But when he had now overtaken"
3736,ARGUMENT.,"her, having pursued her through a great crowd, then the son of"
3737,ARGUMENT.,"magnanimous Tydeus, having stretched forward, wounded the feeble"
3738,ARGUMENT.,"[goddess] in the extremity of the hand, bounding on with the sharp"
3739,ARGUMENT.,"brass. Instantly the spear pierced through the skin, through her"
3740,ARGUMENT.,"ambrosial robe (which the Graces themselves had wrought), at the"
3741,ARGUMENT.,extremity [of the hand] above the palm. Immortal blood flowed from the
3742,ARGUMENT.,"goddess, ichor, such, to wit, as flows from the blessed gods. For they"
3743,ARGUMENT.,"eat not bread, nor drink dark wine; therefore are they bloodless, and"
3744,ARGUMENT.,"are called immortal. But she screaming aloud, cast her son from her:"
3745,ARGUMENT.,"and him Phoebus Apollo rescued in his hands in a sable cloud, lest any"
3746,ARGUMENT.,"of the swift-horsed Greeks, casting the steel into his breast, should"
3747,ARGUMENT.,take away his life. But warlike Diomede shouted loudly after her:

3761,ARGUMENT.,
3762,ARGUMENT.,"“Withdraw, O daughter of Jove, from war and battle. Is it not"
3763,ARGUMENT.,sufficient that thou dost practise deception upon feeble women? But if
3764,ARGUMENT.,"thou wilt go to the war, I certainly think thou wilt hereafter dread"
3765,ARGUMENT.,"battle, even though thou but hearest of it elsewhere.”"
3766,ARGUMENT.,
3767,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke: but she departed, distracted [with pain], for she was"
3768,ARGUMENT.,"grievously exhausted. But swift-footed Iris having taken her, led her"
3769,ARGUMENT.,"outside the crowd, oppressed with griefs; but she began to turn livid"
3770,ARGUMENT.,as to her beauteous skin. Then she found impetuous Mars sitting at the
3771,ARGUMENT.,left of the battle; and his spear and swift horses had been enveloped
3772,ARGUMENT.,"in darkness. But she, falling on her knees, with many entreaties"
3773,ARGUMENT.,besought from her dear brother his golden-frontleted steeds:
3774,ARGUMENT.,
3775,ARGUMENT.,"“Dear brother, render me a service, and give me thy steeds, that I may"
3776,ARGUMENT.,"go to Olympus, where is the seat of the immortals. I am grievously"
3777,ARGUMENT.,"oppressed with a wound which a mortal man, the son of Tydeus, inflicted"
3778,ARGUMENT.,"on me, who now would fight even with father Jove.”"
3779,ARGUMENT.,
3780,ARGUMENT.,Thus she spoke: but Mars gave her the golden-frontleted steeds. But she
3781,ARGUMENT.,"mounted the chariot, grieving in her heart; and Iris mounted beside"
3782,ARGUMENT.,"her, and took the reins in her hands, and scourged them to go on, and"
3783,ARGUMENT.,they flew not unwillingly. And immediately then they reached the seat
3784,ARGUMENT.,"of the gods, the lofty Olympus. There nimble, swift-footed Iris stayed"
3785,ARGUMENT.,"the steeds, having loosed them from the chariot, and set before them"
3786,ARGUMENT.,ambrosial fodder. But the goddess Venus fell at the knees of her mother
3787,ARGUMENT.,"Dione; and she embraced her daughter in her arms, and soothed her with"
3788,ARGUMENT.,"her hand, and addressed her, and said:"
3789,ARGUMENT.,
3790,ARGUMENT.,"“Which of the heavenly gods, beloved daughter, has wantonly done such"
3791,ARGUMENT.,"things to thee, as if thou hadst openly wrought some evil?”"
3792,ARGUMENT.,
3793,ARGUMENT.,"But her laughter-loving Venus answered: “The son of Tydeus, haughty"
3794,ARGUMENT.,"Diomede, has wounded me, because I was withdrawing from battle my"
3795,ARGUMENT.,"beloved son Æneas, who is by far most dear to me of all. For it is no"
3796,ARGUMENT.,longer the destructive contest of Trojans and of Greeks; but now the
3797,ARGUMENT.,Greeks fight even with the immortals.”
3798,ARGUMENT.,
3799,ARGUMENT.,"But her Dione, divine one of goddesses, answered: “Endure, my daughter,"
3800,ARGUMENT.,"and bear up, although grieved; for many of us, possessing Olympian"
3801,ARGUMENT.,"habitations, have in times past endured pains at the hand of men, 213"
3802,ARGUMENT.,"imposing heavy griefs on one another. Mars, in the first place, endured"
3803,ARGUMENT.,"it, when Otus and valiant Ephialtes, the sons of Aloëus, bound him in a"
3804,ARGUMENT.,strong chain. He was chained in a brazen prison for thirteen months:
3805,ARGUMENT.,"and perhaps Mars, insatiate of war, had perished there, had not his"
3806,ARGUMENT.,"stepmother, all-fair Eëribæa, told it to Mercury; but he stole Mars"
3807,ARGUMENT.,"away, already exhausted, for the cruel chain subdued him. Juno also"
3808,ARGUMENT.,"suffered, when the brave son of Amphitryon smote her in the right"
3809,ARGUMENT.,breast with a three-pronged shaft. Then most irremediable pain seized
3810,ARGUMENT.,"her. Amongst these Pluto also endured a swift shaft, when the same"
3811,ARGUMENT.,"hero, the son of ægis-bearing Jove, afflicted him with pains at Pylos"
3812,ARGUMENT.,"amongst the dead, having wounded him. But he went to the palace of"
3813,ARGUMENT.,"Jove, and the lofty Olympus, grieving in his heart, and transfixed with"
3814,ARGUMENT.,"pains; for the shaft had pierced into his huge shoulder, and tortured"
3815,ARGUMENT.,"his soul. But Pæon healed him, sprinkling pain-assuaging remedies, for"
3816,ARGUMENT.,"he was not at all mortal. Audacious, regardless one! who felt no"
3817,ARGUMENT.,"compunction in doing lawless deeds,—who with his bow violated the gods"
3818,ARGUMENT.,that dwell in Olympus. But against thee azure-eyed goddess Minerva has
3819,ARGUMENT.,excited this man. Infatuate! nor does the son of Tydeus know this in
3820,ARGUMENT.,"his mind, that he is by no means long-lived who fights with the"
3821,ARGUMENT.,"immortals, nor ever at his knees will sons lisp a father’s name, as he"
3822,ARGUMENT.,"returns from war and dreadful battle. Therefore, let the son of Tydeus"
3823,ARGUMENT.,"now, though he be very brave, have a care, lest a better than thou"
3824,ARGUMENT.,"fight with him: lest at a future time Ægialëa, the very prudent"
3825,ARGUMENT.,"daughter of Adrastus, the noble spouse of horse-taming Diomede,"
3826,ARGUMENT.,"grieving, should rouse her servants from sleep, longing for the husband"
3827,ARGUMENT.,"of her youth, the bravest of the Greeks.”"
3828,ARGUMENT.,
3829,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 213: (return)  Speaking of these humiliations of the gods,"
3830,ARGUMENT.,"Grote, Hist. t. i. p. 78, well observes: “The god who serves is for a"
3831,ARGUMENT.,time degraded; but the supreme god who commands the servitude is in the
3832,ARGUMENT.,"like proportion exalted, whilst the idea of some sort of order and"
3833,ARGUMENT.,government among these super-human beings was never lost sight of.”
3834,ARGUMENT.,
3835,ARGUMENT.,"She spoke, and with her palms wiped off the ichor from her hand: the"
3836,ARGUMENT.,"hand was healed, and the severe pains mitigated. But then Minerva and"
3837,ARGUMENT.,"Juno looking on, provoked Saturnian Jove with heart-cutting words; but"
3838,ARGUMENT.,amidst them azure-eyed goddess Minerva thus began speaking:
3839,ARGUMENT.,
3840,ARGUMENT.,"“Father Jove, wilt thou indeed be angry with me on account of what I"
3841,ARGUMENT.,"shall say? Surely it must be that Venus, inspiring some one of the"
3842,ARGUMENT.,"Grecian women with a desire of accompanying the Trojans, whom now she"
3843,ARGUMENT.,"exceedingly loves, while caressing one of those fair-robed Grecian"
3844,ARGUMENT.,"women, has torn her delicate hand against a golden buckle.”"
3845,ARGUMENT.,
3846,ARGUMENT.,"Thus she spoke: but the father of men and gods smiled, and having"
3847,ARGUMENT.,"called, he thus accosted golden Venus:"
3848,ARGUMENT.,
3849,ARGUMENT.,"“Not to thee, daughter mine, are intrusted warlike works; but do thou"
3850,ARGUMENT.,"confine thyself to the desirable offices of marriage, and all these"
3851,ARGUMENT.,things shall be a care to swift Mars and to Minerva.”
3852,ARGUMENT.,
3853,ARGUMENT.,"Thus they, indeed, were speaking such things to each other. But"
3854,ARGUMENT.,"Diomede, doughty in the din of battle, rushed upon Æneas, conscious"
3855,ARGUMENT.,that Apollo himself held over him his hands. But he revered not the
3856,ARGUMENT.,"mighty god, for he always longed to slay Æneas, and despoil him of his"
3857,ARGUMENT.,"glorious armour. Thrice then, immediately, he rushed on, eager to slay"
3858,ARGUMENT.,"him, and thrice Apollo repelled his shield with violence; but when at"
3859,ARGUMENT.,"length the fourth time he rushed on, like a god, the far-darting Apollo"
3860,ARGUMENT.,"menacing terribly, addressed him: “Consider, O son of Tydeus, and"
3861,ARGUMENT.,"retire, nor wish to think things equal with the gods; for the race of"
3862,ARGUMENT.,the immortal gods and of men walking on the earth is in nowise
3863,ARGUMENT.,similar.”
3864,ARGUMENT.,
3865,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke: but the son of Tydeus retired a little, biding the wrath"
3866,ARGUMENT.,"of far-darting Apollo. But Apollo placed Æneas apart from the crowd, in"
3867,ARGUMENT.,"sacred Pergamus, where his temple was. 214 Latona and shaft-rejoicing"
3868,ARGUMENT.,"Diana healed him in the mighty shrine, and adorned him with glory. But"
3869,ARGUMENT.,silver-bowed Apollo formed a phantom like unto Æneas himself and such
3870,ARGUMENT.,in arms. Around the phantom the Trojans and the noble Greeks smote on
3871,ARGUMENT.,"each others’ breasts the well-battered ox-hide shields, and the light"
3872,ARGUMENT.,bucklers. Then at length Phœbus Apollo addressed impetuous Mars:

3878,ARGUMENT.,
3879,ARGUMENT.,"“Mars! Mars! man-slaughterer, gore-tainted, wall-batterer! wouldst not"
3880,ARGUMENT.,"thou now, meeting this man, the son of Venus, withdraw him from the"
3881,ARGUMENT.,"battle, who would even now cope with father Jove? First, indeed, in"
3882,ARGUMENT.,"close combat, he wounded Venus in the hand, at the wrist; but then he"
3883,ARGUMENT.,"assailed me, like unto a god.”"
3884,ARGUMENT.,
3885,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having spoken, he sat down on lofty Pergamus; but destructive Mars"
3886,ARGUMENT.,"aroused the ranks of the Trojans, going through them, assimilating"
3887,ARGUMENT.,"himself to Acamus, the swift leader of the Thracians, and thus he"
3888,ARGUMENT.,harangued the Jove-nourished sons of Priam:
3889,ARGUMENT.,
3890,ARGUMENT.,"“Ye sons of Priam, Jove-nourished king, how long will ye suffer the"
3891,ARGUMENT.,people to be slain by the Greeks? Is it until they fight around the
3892,ARGUMENT.,"well-made gates? A hero lies prostate, whom we honoured equally with"
3893,ARGUMENT.,"noble Hector, the son of magnanimous Anchises. But come, let us rescue"
3894,ARGUMENT.,from the assault our excellent companion.”
3895,ARGUMENT.,
3896,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having spoken, he excited the might and courage of heart. Then"
3897,ARGUMENT.,Sarpedon much rebuked noble Hector:
3898,ARGUMENT.,
3899,ARGUMENT.,"Hector, where now has that strength gone, which thou didst formerly"
3900,ARGUMENT.,"possess? Thou saidst, I ween, that thou, with thy kindred and thy"
3901,ARGUMENT.,"brothers, couldst defend the city without the forces and allies. Now I"
3902,ARGUMENT.,"can neither see nor perceive any of these; but they crouch down, like"
3903,ARGUMENT.,"dogs but a lion: we, on the contrary, who are here mere allies, bear"
3904,ARGUMENT.,"the brunt of the fight. Even I, being thine ally, have come from a very"
3905,ARGUMENT.,"great distance; for far off is Lycia, at lying Xanthus, where I left my"
3906,ARGUMENT.,"beloved wife and my infant son, and many possessions, which he who is"
3907,ARGUMENT.,"poor covets: but I, nevertheless, exhort the Lycians, and ready myself"
3908,ARGUMENT.,to fight with that hero; and yet there is here to me such store as the
3909,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks can carry or let. But thou standest still, and dost not exhort"
3910,ARGUMENT.,"even the forces to stand and to defend their wives. Beware perchance,"
3911,ARGUMENT.,"as though ensnared in the meshes of an alluring net, thou become a prey"
3912,ARGUMENT.,and a spoil to hostile for quickly will they destroy thy well-inhabited
3913,ARGUMENT.,"city. As it behoves thee, both night and day, to interest thyself in"
3914,ARGUMENT.,"these matters, beseeching the chiefs of thy far-summoned force to"
3915,ARGUMENT.,"persevere with ardour, and forego their violent strife."
3916,ARGUMENT.,
3917,ARGUMENT.,"Thus spoke Sarpedon, but his speech gnawed the heart of Hector, and"
3918,ARGUMENT.,"immediately he leaped from his chariot with his armour to the ground,"
3919,ARGUMENT.,"and brandishing his sharp spear, went in all directions through the"
3920,ARGUMENT.,"army, exhorting the battle; and he stirred up a grievous conflict. The"
3921,ARGUMENT.,Trojans rallied and stood against the Greeks; but the Greeks stood in
3922,ARGUMENT.,"close array, withstood them, nor fled."
3923,ARGUMENT.,
3924,ARGUMENT.,"And as the wind scatters the chaff about the threshing-floors, when men"
3925,ARGUMENT.,"are winnowing [it], and yellow Ceres is separating both the grain and"
3926,ARGUMENT.,"the chaff, the winds rush along; and the chaff-heaps 215 grow white"
3927,ARGUMENT.,"beneath; thus then the Greeks became white with the chaff from above,"
3928,ARGUMENT.,"which indeed through them, as they again mingled in the combat, the"
3929,ARGUMENT.,feet of the steeds struck up [the ground] to the brazen heaven; for the
3930,ARGUMENT.,charioteers turning back. But they directed the strength of theirs
3931,ARGUMENT.,"straight forward; and fierce Mars spread a vapour over the battle,"
3932,ARGUMENT.,"aiding the Trojans, going about everywhere, echoing the commands of"
3933,ARGUMENT.,golden-sworded Phœbus Apollo and ordered him to excite the courage of
3934,ARGUMENT.,"the Trojans, whenever he should see Pallas Minerva departing; for she"
3935,ARGUMENT.,was an ally of the Greeks. But he sent forth Æneas from his very rich
3936,ARGUMENT.,shrine and infused strength into the breast of the shepherd of the
3937,ARGUMENT.,people.

3942,ARGUMENT.,Then Æneas placed himself amidst his companions and they rejoiced when
3943,ARGUMENT.,"they saw him approaching alive, unhurt and having excellent strength."
3944,ARGUMENT.,"They did not ever, ask any questions; for a different labour did not"
3945,ARGUMENT.,pale which the silver-bowed god and man-slaughtering war and Strife
3946,ARGUMENT.,"insatiably raging, had excited. But then Greeks, the two Ajaces, and"
3947,ARGUMENT.,"Ulysses and Diomede, urged on to fight. But they, even by themselves,"
3948,ARGUMENT.,"feared neither the violent attacks 216 of the Trojans, nor their"
3949,ARGUMENT.,"shouts: but remained firm, like unto clouds, which the son of Saturn,"
3950,ARGUMENT.,"during a calm, has placed upon the lofty mountains, at rest, when the"
3951,ARGUMENT.,"might of Boreas sleeps, 217 and of the other impetuous winds, which,"
3952,ARGUMENT.,"blowing with shrill blasts, disperse the shadowy clouds. Thus the"
3953,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks awaited the Trojans, standing firm, nor fled. But the son of"
3954,ARGUMENT.,"Atreus kept hurrying through the host, exhorting them much:"
3955,ARGUMENT.,
3956,ARGUMENT.,"“O friends, be men, and assume a valiant heart, and feel shame 218"
3957,ARGUMENT.,towards each other through the fierce engagements: for more of those
3958,ARGUMENT.,"men who dread shame are safe, than are slain; but from fugitives"
3959,ARGUMENT.,"neither does any glory arise, nor any assistance.”"
3960,ARGUMENT.,
3961,ARGUMENT.,"He spoke, and darted with his spear quickly, and struck Dëicoon, son of"
3962,ARGUMENT.,"Pergasis, a warrior chief, the companion of magnanimous Æneas, whom the"
3963,ARGUMENT.,Trojans honoured equally with the sons of Priam; since he was prompt to
3964,ARGUMENT.,fight amidst the van. Him then king Agamemnon struck in the shield with
3965,ARGUMENT.,"his spear, but it [the shield] did not repel the spear, for even"
3966,ARGUMENT.,"through this it passed onwards, and pierced him through the belt, at"
3967,ARGUMENT.,"the lower part of the stomach. And he made a crash as he fell, and his"
3968,ARGUMENT.,arms rattled over him.

4045,ARGUMENT.,"But him Diomede, brave in fight, seeing, trembled. As when a man,"

4049,ARGUMENT.,and he said to the host:
4050,ARGUMENT.,
4051,ARGUMENT.,"“O friends, how do we all admire noble Hector, that he is both a"
4052,ARGUMENT.,spearman and a daring warrior! But with him one at least of the gods is
4053,ARGUMENT.,"ever present, who wards off death; even now Mars in person stands by"
4054,ARGUMENT.,"him like unto a mortal man. But retreat back, [with your faces] turned"
4055,ARGUMENT.,"always to the Trojans, nor desire to fight valiantly against the gods.”"
4056,ARGUMENT.,
4057,ARGUMENT.,Thus then he said: but the Trojans advanced very near them. There
4058,ARGUMENT.,"Hector slew two heroes skilled in battle, Menesthes and Anchialus,"
4059,ARGUMENT.,being in one chariot. But mighty Telamonian Ajax pitied them falling;
4060,ARGUMENT.,"and advancing he stood very near them, and launched with his shining"
4061,ARGUMENT.,"spear, and smote Amphius, son of Selagus, who, exceedingly rich in"
4062,ARGUMENT.,"property and crops, dwelt in Pæsus. But fate had led him as an ally to"
4063,ARGUMENT.,"Priam and his sons. Him Telamonian Ajax smote on the belt, and the"
4064,ARGUMENT.,"long-shadowed spear was fixed in the pit of his stomach. Falling, he"
4065,ARGUMENT.,"made a crash, and illustrious Ajax ran up to him, about to spoil [him"
4066,ARGUMENT.,"of] his armour; but the Trojans poured upon him sharp spears, shining"
4067,ARGUMENT.,"all around, and his shield received many. But he, pressing on him with"
4068,ARGUMENT.,"his heel, drew from the body his brazen spear; however, he was not able"
4069,ARGUMENT.,"to take off from his shoulders any other beautiful armour, for he was"
4070,ARGUMENT.,pressed upon with weapons. He also dreaded the stout defence of haughty
4071,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans, 223 who, both numerous and doughty, stood around, stretching"
4072,ARGUMENT.,"forth their spears, and who drove him away from them, although being"
4073,ARGUMENT.,"mighty, and valiant, and renowned. But he, retiring, was repelled by"
4074,ARGUMENT.,force.

4084,ARGUMENT.,"cloud-collecting Jove, were now rushing against one another, Tlepolemus"
4085,ARGUMENT.,first addressed him [Sarpedon]:
4086,ARGUMENT.,
4087,ARGUMENT.,"“Sarpedon, chief of the Lycians, what necessity is there for thee,"

4089,ARGUMENT.,"thou art the offspring of ægis-bearing Jove, since thou art far"
4090,ARGUMENT.,"inferior to those heroes, who were of Jove, in the time of ancient men."
4091,ARGUMENT.,"But what sort do they say that Hercules was, my bold-minded,"
4092,ARGUMENT.,"lion-hearted father? who formerly coming hither, on account of the"
4093,ARGUMENT.,"steeds of Laomedon, with six ships only, and with a few men, laid waste"
4094,ARGUMENT.,"the city of Ilium, and widowed its streets. But thou hast an ignoble"
4095,ARGUMENT.,"mind, and thy forces are perishing away; nor do I think that thou wilt"
4096,ARGUMENT.,"be an assistance to the Trojans, having come from Lycia, not even if"
4097,ARGUMENT.,"thou be exceedingly valiant; but that, slain by me, thou wilt pass"
4098,ARGUMENT.,through the gates of Hades.”
4099,ARGUMENT.,
4100,ARGUMENT.,"But him Sarpedon, leader of the Lycians, in return accosted:"
4101,ARGUMENT.,"“Tlepolemus, he indeed overturned sacred Ilium, through the folly of"
4102,ARGUMENT.,"the hero, famous Laomedon, who reproved with harsh language him who had"
4103,ARGUMENT.,"deserved well, nor did he give back the steeds, on account of which he"
4104,ARGUMENT.,came from afar. But I tell thee that here slaughter and gloomy death
4105,ARGUMENT.,"will befall thee at my hands; and that, subdued by my spear, thou wilt"
4106,ARGUMENT.,"give glory to me, and a spirit to steed-famed 224 Pluto.”"

4111,ARGUMENT.,
4112,ARGUMENT.,"Thus spoke Sarpedon: but Tlepolemus raised his ashen spear, and from"
4113,ARGUMENT.,"their hands, at the same moment, flew the long spears. Sarpedon, on his"
4114,ARGUMENT.,"part, struck the centre of [his adversary’s] neck, and the grievous"
4115,ARGUMENT.,weapon passed right through; and gloomy night overspread his eyes. But
4116,ARGUMENT.,Tlepolemus in the meantime had struck Sarpedon in the left thigh with
4117,ARGUMENT.,"his long spear; and the spear, rushing with violence, passed through,"
4118,ARGUMENT.,grazing the bone: but his father as yet averted death.
4119,ARGUMENT.,
4120,ARGUMENT.,His noble companions bore godlike Sarpedon from the battle; but the
4121,ARGUMENT.,"long spear, trailed along with him, pained him; but this no one of them"
4122,ARGUMENT.,"hastening noticed, nor thought of extracting from his thigh the ashen"
4123,ARGUMENT.,"spear, that he might ascend the chariot; for such anxiety did his"
4124,ARGUMENT.,attendants entertain for him. But on the other side the well-greaved
4125,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks carried Tlepolemus from the fight; and divine Ulysses,"
4126,ARGUMENT.,"possessing an enduring heart, perceived them, and his soul was stirred"
4127,ARGUMENT.,"within him. And then he anxiously pondered in his mind and soul,"
4128,ARGUMENT.,"whether he should pursue farther the son of loud-thundering Jove, or"
4129,ARGUMENT.,should take away the lives of many more Lycians. But it was not fated
4130,ARGUMENT.,for magnanimous Ulysses to slay the brave son of Jove with the sharp
4131,ARGUMENT.,spear. Therefore Minerva turned his thoughts towards the multitude of
4132,ARGUMENT.,"the Lycians. Then he slew Cœranus, and Alastor, and Chromius, and"
4133,ARGUMENT.,"Alcander, and Halius, and Noëmon, and Prytanis. And yet more Lycians"
4134,ARGUMENT.,"would noble Ulysses have slain, had not mighty crest-tossing Hector"
4135,ARGUMENT.,"quickly perceived him. He therefore went through the van, armed in"
4136,ARGUMENT.,"shining brass, bearing terror to the Greeks: then Sarpedon, the son of"
4137,ARGUMENT.,"Jove, rejoiced at him approaching, and spoke [this] mournful address:"
4138,ARGUMENT.,
4139,ARGUMENT.,"“O son of Priam, I pray thee, suffer me not to lie a prey to the"
4140,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks, but aid me. Even then 225 let life forsake me in thy city;"
4141,ARGUMENT.,"since I was not destined to gladden my dear wife and infant son,"
4142,ARGUMENT.,returning home to my dear fatherland.”

4147,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke: but him plume-waving Hector answered nought, but flew"
4148,ARGUMENT.,"past him, in order that he might repel the Greeks with all haste, and"
4149,ARGUMENT.,take away the lives of many. His noble companions meantime placed
4150,ARGUMENT.,godlike Sarpedon under a very beautiful beech of ægis-bearing Jove.
4151,ARGUMENT.,"Stout Pelagon then, who was his beloved companion, forced out the ashen"
4152,ARGUMENT.,"spear from his thigh. Thereupon animation left him, and darkness was"
4153,ARGUMENT.,"poured over his eyes; but he again revived, for the breeze of Boreas,"
4154,ARGUMENT.,"breathing upon him around, refreshed in spirit him panting with"
4155,ARGUMENT.,difficulty.
4156,ARGUMENT.,
4157,ARGUMENT.,"But the Greeks, on account of Mars and brazen-helmed Hector, neither"
4158,ARGUMENT.,"were driven at any time back to their sable ships, nor did they advance"
4159,ARGUMENT.,"forward to battle; but always kept giving ground, since they had heard"
4160,ARGUMENT.,that Mars was with the Trojans.
4161,ARGUMENT.,
4162,ARGUMENT.,"Then whom first, whom last did Hector, the son of Priam, and brazen"
4163,ARGUMENT.,"Mars slay? The godlike Teuthras, and moreover the knight Orestes, the"
4164,ARGUMENT.,"Ætolian spearman Trechus, and Œnomaus, and Helenus of the race of"
4165,ARGUMENT.,"Œnops, and Oresbius of flexible 226 belt, who dwelt in Hyla, near the"
4166,ARGUMENT.,"lake Cephissus, very intent on wealth: and near him dwelt other"

4173,ARGUMENT.,When therefore the white-armed goddess Juno perceived these Greeks
4174,ARGUMENT.,"perishing in the violent engagement, straightway to Minerva she"

4176,ARGUMENT.,
4177,ARGUMENT.,"“Strange! O daughter of ægis-bearing Jove, unwearied one, certainly we"
4178,ARGUMENT.,"have made a vain promise to Menelaus, that he should return after"
4179,ARGUMENT.,"having destroyed well-walled Ilium, if we suffer destructive Mars thus"
4180,ARGUMENT.,"to rage. But come, let us too bethink ourselves of some powerful aid.”"
4181,ARGUMENT.,
4182,ARGUMENT.,Thus she spoke; nor did the azure-eyed goddess Minerva disobey her.
4183,ARGUMENT.,"Juno, on her part, venerable goddess, daughter of mighty Saturn,"
4184,ARGUMENT.,"quickly moving, harnessed her gold-caparisoned steeds; but Hebe"

4187,ARGUMENT.,"felloe is of gold, imperishable: but above [are] brazen tires fastened"
4188,ARGUMENT.,"on them, wonderful to be seen; but the circular naves on both sides are"
4189,ARGUMENT.,of silver; and the body 227 was stretched on with gold and silver
4190,ARGUMENT.,thongs (there was a double circular rim); from this projected a silver
4191,ARGUMENT.,"pole; at its extremity she bound the golden, beauteous yoke, and to it"
4192,ARGUMENT.,"attached the beautiful golden poitrels. But Juno, longing for conquest"
4193,ARGUMENT.,"and battle, led the swift-footed steeds under the yoke."
4194,ARGUMENT.,
4195,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 227: (return)  δίφρος is properly the seat, but is here put"

4199,ARGUMENT.,"down on her father’s floor her dainty robe of variegated hue, which she"
4200,ARGUMENT.,"herself had wrought and worked with her own hands: then she, having put"
4201,ARGUMENT.,"on her tunic, equipped herself for the tearful war in the armour of"
4202,ARGUMENT.,"cloud-compelling Jove, and around her shoulders she then threw the"
4203,ARGUMENT.,"fringed ægis, dreadful, around which on all sides Terror appears"
4204,ARGUMENT.,"plumed. Thereon was Strife, thereon Fortitude, and thereon was chilling"
4205,ARGUMENT.,"Pursuit; 228 on it was the Gorgonian head of the dreadful monster,"
4206,ARGUMENT.,"dire, horrible, a portent of ægis-bearing Jove. On her head she placed"
4207,ARGUMENT.,"her four-crested helmet, with a spreading metal ridge, 229 golden,"
4208,ARGUMENT.,sufficient for the heavy-armed of a hundred cities. She then stepped
4209,ARGUMENT.,"into her shining chariot with her feet; and took her spear, heavy,"
4210,ARGUMENT.,"huge, and sturdy, with which she, sprung from a dread sire, subdues the"
4211,ARGUMENT.,"ranks of heroic men, with whomsoever she is wroth. But Juno with the"
4212,ARGUMENT.,lash quickly urged on the steeds. The gates of heaven creaked
4213,ARGUMENT.,"spontaneously, the gates which the Hours guarded, to whom are intrusted"
4214,ARGUMENT.,"the mighty heaven and Olympus, as well to open the dense cloud as to"
4215,ARGUMENT.,"close it. In this way, indeed, through these gates, they drove their"
4216,ARGUMENT.,"steeds, urged on with the goad: and they found the son of Saturn"
4217,ARGUMENT.,sitting apart from the other gods on the highest summit of many-peaked
4218,ARGUMENT.,"Olympus. There staying her steeds, the white-armed goddess Juno"
4219,ARGUMENT.,"interrogated supreme Saturnian Jove, and thus addressed him:"
4220,ARGUMENT.,
4221,ARGUMENT.,"“O father Jove, art thou not indignant at Mars for these bold"

4223,ARGUMENT.,"destroyed rashly, nor as became him: a grief indeed to me; but Venus"
4224,ARGUMENT.,"and silver-bowed Apollo in quiet are delighted, having let slip this"
4225,ARGUMENT.,"frantic [god], who knows no rights. Father Jove, wilt thou be angry"

4243,ARGUMENT.,
4244,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke: nor did the white-armed goddess Juno disobey, but she"

4247,ARGUMENT.,"his eyes, sitting upon some lofty point, and looking over the darkling"

4250,ARGUMENT.,"where Simois and Scamander unite their streams, there the white-armed"
4251,ARGUMENT.,"goddess Juno stayed her steeds, having loosed them from the chariot,"

4275,ARGUMENT.,"the hollow ships, far away from the city.”"
4276,ARGUMENT.,
4277,ARGUMENT.,"Thus saying, she aroused the strength and courage of each. The"
4278,ARGUMENT.,azure-eyed goddess Minerva rushed towards the son of Tydeus; but she
4279,ARGUMENT.,"found that prince by his steeds and chariot, cooling the wound which"
4280,ARGUMENT.,Pandarus had inflicted on him with a shaft. For perspiration had
4281,ARGUMENT.,afflicted him beneath the broad belt of his well-orbed shield: with
4282,ARGUMENT.,"this was he afflicted, and he was fatigued as to his hand; and raising"
4283,ARGUMENT.,"the belt, he wiped away the black gore. Then the goddess touched the"
4284,ARGUMENT.,"yoke of the horses, and said:"
4285,ARGUMENT.,
4286,ARGUMENT.,“Little like himself has Tydeus begotten a son. Tydeus was certainly
4287,ARGUMENT.,"small in body, but a warrior. And even when I suffered him not to"
4288,ARGUMENT.,"fight, nor to rush furiously to battle, when he came far from the"
4289,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks, an ambassador to Thebes to the numerous Cadmeans, I commanded"
4290,ARGUMENT.,"him to feast quietly in the palaces; but he, retaining his doughty"
4291,ARGUMENT.,"spirit, as before, challenged the youths, the Cadmeans, and easily"
4292,ARGUMENT.,conquered them in everything; so great an auxiliary was I to him. But
4293,ARGUMENT.,"thee, indeed, I stand by and preserve, and I exhort thee freely to"
4294,ARGUMENT.,"fight against the Trojans. But either weariness, from great toil, has"
4295,ARGUMENT.,"entered thy limbs, or at least disheartening fear in some manner"
4296,ARGUMENT.,possesses thee. Thou art not henceforth to be deemed at least the son
4297,ARGUMENT.,"of Tydeus, the gallant son of Æneus.”"
4298,ARGUMENT.,
4299,ARGUMENT.,"But her valiant Diomede answering addressed: “I know thee, O goddess,"
4300,ARGUMENT.,daughter of ægis-bearing Jove; therefore will I willingly tell this
4301,ARGUMENT.,"word to thee, nor will I conceal it. Neither does any disheartening"
4302,ARGUMENT.,"fear possess me, nor any sloth: but as yet I am mindful of thy"
4303,ARGUMENT.,"mandates, which thou didst enjoin. Thou didst not suffer me to fight"
4304,ARGUMENT.,"with the other happy gods; but if Venus, the daughter of Jove, should"
4305,ARGUMENT.,"come into the battle, to wound her at least with the sharp steel."
4306,ARGUMENT.,"Wherefore now I myself retire, and have ordered all the other Greeks to"
4307,ARGUMENT.,be collected here: for I perceive Mars dispensing the battle.”
4308,ARGUMENT.,
4309,ARGUMENT.,"But him the azure-eyed goddess Minerva then answered: “Diomede, son of"
4310,ARGUMENT.,"Tydeus, most dear to my soul, neither fear this Mars at all, nor any"
4311,ARGUMENT.,"other of the immortals; such an auxiliary am I to thee. But come, first"
4312,ARGUMENT.,"direct thy solid-hoofed steeds against Mars, strike him in close"
4313,ARGUMENT.,"combat, nor regard impetuous Mars, this frenzied and unnatural pest,"
4314,ARGUMENT.,shifter from one to another; who lately haranguing promised me and
4315,ARGUMENT.,"Juno, that he would fight against the Trojans, and aid the Greeks; but"
4316,ARGUMENT.,"now he mixes with the Trojans, and has forgotten these.”"
4317,ARGUMENT.,
4318,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having said, she forced Sthenelus from his horses to the ground,"
4319,ARGUMENT.,dragging him back with her hand; but he promptly leaped down. Then the
4320,ARGUMENT.,"goddess herself, infuriate, ascended the chariot beside noble Diomede,"
4321,ARGUMENT.,and greatly did the beechen axle groan under the weight; for it bore a
4322,ARGUMENT.,dreadful goddess and a very brave hero. Then Pallas Minerva seized the
4323,ARGUMENT.,scourge and the reins. Straightway she drove the solid-hoofed steeds
4324,ARGUMENT.,"against Mars first. He, indeed, had just slain huge Periphas, the"
4325,ARGUMENT.,"illustrious son of Ochesius, by far the bravest of the Ætolians. Him"
4326,ARGUMENT.,indeed gore-stained Mars slew; but Minerva put on the helmet of Pluto
4327,ARGUMENT.,that impetuous Mars might not see her.
4328,ARGUMENT.,
4329,ARGUMENT.,"But when man-slaughtering Mars saw noble Diomede, he suffered huge"
4330,ARGUMENT.,"Periphas to lie there, where first slaying him he had taken away his"
4331,ARGUMENT.,"life, but he went straight against horse breaking Diomede. And when"
4332,ARGUMENT.,"these came near, advancing against each other, Mars first, over the"
4333,ARGUMENT.,"yoke and the reins of the steeds, stretched himself forward with his"

4335,ARGUMENT.,"goddess Minerva having caught in her hand, turned from the chariot, so"
4336,ARGUMENT.,"as to be borne away in vain. But next Diomede, valiant in the din of"
4337,ARGUMENT.,"war, made the attack with his brazen spear; and Pallas Minerva firmly"
4338,ARGUMENT.,"fastened it in his lowest flank, where he was girt with his belt. In"
4339,ARGUMENT.,"that very part striking, she wounded him, and tore his beautiful skin,"
4340,ARGUMENT.,"and drew out the spear again. Then roared brazen Mars, as loud as nine"
4341,ARGUMENT.,"or ten thousand men roar in war, joining the strife of battle. And then"
4342,ARGUMENT.,"fear seized the terrified Greeks and Trojans, so loud bellowed Mars,"
4343,ARGUMENT.,insatiate of war.
4344,ARGUMENT.,
4345,ARGUMENT.,"And as when from the clouds, a gloomy haze appears, a heavy-blowing"
4346,ARGUMENT.,"wind arising from heat; such did brazen Mars appear to Diomede, son of"
4347,ARGUMENT.,"Tydeus, going amid the clouds into the broad heaven. Quickly he reached"
4348,ARGUMENT.,"lofty Olympus, the seat of the gods, and sat near Saturnian Jove,"
4349,ARGUMENT.,"grieving in his heart, and showed the immortal blood flowing down from"
4350,ARGUMENT.,"the wound, and complaining, he spoke winged words:"
4351,ARGUMENT.,
4352,ARGUMENT.,"“Father Jove, art thou not incensed beholding these violent deeds?"
4353,ARGUMENT.,"Ever, of a truth, are we deities suffering most grievous woes from the"
4354,ARGUMENT.,"machinations of each other, and [whilst] conferring favour upon men. We"
4355,ARGUMENT.,"all are indignant with thee; 232 for thou hast begotten a mad,"
4356,ARGUMENT.,"pernicious daughter, to whom evil works are ever a care. For all the"
4357,ARGUMENT.,"other gods, as many as are in Olympus, obey thee, and unto thee each of"
4358,ARGUMENT.,"us is subject. But her thou restrainest not by words, nor by any act,"
4359,ARGUMENT.,"but dost indulge her, since thou thyself didst beget this destructive"
4360,ARGUMENT.,"daughter. Who now has urged on Diomede, the overbearing son of Tydeus,"
4361,ARGUMENT.,"to rage against the immortal gods. Venus he first wounded, in close"
4362,ARGUMENT.,"fight, in the hand at the wrist; and, equal to a god, he afterwards"
4363,ARGUMENT.,rushed on myself; but my swift feet withdrew me; [otherwise] I should
4364,ARGUMENT.,certainly for a long time have endured woes there amidst the dreadful

4503,ARGUMENT.,"Helenus, son of Priam, by far the best of augurs, standing near, spoken"

4505,ARGUMENT.,
4506,ARGUMENT.,"“Æneas and Hector, since upon you chiefly of the Trojans and Lydians"

4518,ARGUMENT.,"seems to her the most beautiful, and the largest in her palace, and"
4519,ARGUMENT.,which is much the most dear to her. And let her promise to sacrifice to
4520,ARGUMENT.,"that goddess in her temple twelve yearling heifers, as yet ungoaded, if"

4554,ARGUMENT.,"But Glaucus, son of Hippolochus, and the son of Tydeus met in the midst"

4556,ARGUMENT.,"against each other, Diomede, brave in the din of war, first addressed"
4557,ARGUMENT.,him:
4558,ARGUMENT.,
4559,ARGUMENT.,"“Who of mortal men art thou, O most brave? For never yet have I beheld"

4561,ARGUMENT.,"in thy confidence, since thou hast awaited my long-shadowed spear."
4562,ARGUMENT.,"Certainly they are sons of the hapless who meet my strength. But, if"
4563,ARGUMENT.,"one of the immortals, thou art come from heaven, I would not fight with"
4564,ARGUMENT.,"the celestial gods. For valiant Lycurgus, the son of Dryas, did not"
4565,ARGUMENT.,"live long, who contended with the heavenly gods; he who once pursued"
4566,ARGUMENT.,the nurses of raving Bacchus through sacred Nyssa; but they all at once
4567,ARGUMENT.,"cast their sacred implements 240 on the ground, smitten by man-slaying"
4568,ARGUMENT.,"Lycurgus with an ox-goad; but Bacchus, too, terrified, sunk under the"
4569,ARGUMENT.,"wave of the sea, and Thetis received him affrighted in her bosom; for"
4570,ARGUMENT.,"dreadful trembling had seized him, on account of the threat of the man."
4571,ARGUMENT.,"With him the peaceful-living gods were afterwards enraged, and the son"
4572,ARGUMENT.,"of Saturn rendered him blind, nor did he live much longer, for he"
4573,ARGUMENT.,became an object of aversion to all the immortal gods. Wherefore I
4574,ARGUMENT.,should not wish to fight with the blessed gods. But if thou art any one
4575,ARGUMENT.,"of mortals, who eat the fruit of the earth, come hither, that thou"
4576,ARGUMENT.,mayest speedily reach the goal of death.”
4577,ARGUMENT.,
4578,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 240: (return)  Not merely the thyrsi. See Anthon.
4579,ARGUMENT.,
4580,ARGUMENT.,Him then the renowned son of Hippolochus addressed in turn:
4581,ARGUMENT.,"“Magnanimous son of Tydeus, why dost thou inquire of my race? As is the"
4582,ARGUMENT.,"race of leaves, even such is the race of men. 241 Some leaves the wind"
4583,ARGUMENT.,"sheds upon the ground, but the fructifying wood produces others, and"
4584,ARGUMENT.,these grow up in the season of spring. Such is the generation of men;
4585,ARGUMENT.,"one produces, another ceases [to do so]. But if thou wouldst learn even"
4586,ARGUMENT.,"these things, that thou mayest well know my lineage (for many know it),"
4587,ARGUMENT.,"there is a city, Ephyra, in a nook of horse-pasturing Argos; there"
4588,ARGUMENT.,"dwelt Sisyphus, who was the most cunning of mortals, Sisyphus, son of"
4589,ARGUMENT.,"Æolus; and he begat a son, Glaucus. But Glaucus begat blameless"
4590,ARGUMENT.,Bellerophon; to whom the gods gave beauty and agreeable manliness. But
4591,ARGUMENT.,against him Prœtus devised evils in his soul: who accordingly banished
4592,ARGUMENT.,him from the state (since he was far the best of the Greeks; for Jove
4593,ARGUMENT.,"had subjected them to his sceptre). With him the wife of Prœtus, noble"
4594,ARGUMENT.,"Antea, 242 passionately longed to be united in secret love; but by no"
4595,ARGUMENT.,"means could she persuade just-minded, wise-reflecting Bellerophon. She,"
4596,ARGUMENT.,"therefore, telling a falsehood, thus addressed king Prœtus: ‘Mayest"
4597,ARGUMENT.,"thou be dead, O Prœtus! or do thou slay Bellerophon, who desired to be"
4598,ARGUMENT.,united in love with me against my will.’ Thus she said: but rage
4599,ARGUMENT.,"possessed the king at what he heard. He was unwilling, indeed, to slay"
4600,ARGUMENT.,"him, for he scrupled this in his mind; but he sent him into Lycia, and"
4601,ARGUMENT.,"gave to him fatal characters, writing many things of deadly purport on"
4602,ARGUMENT.,"a sealed tablet; and ordered him to show it to his father-in-law, to"
4603,ARGUMENT.,"the end that he might perish. He therefore went into Lycia, under the"
4604,ARGUMENT.,blameless escort of the gods; but when now he had arrived at Lycia and
4605,ARGUMENT.,"at the river Xanthus, the king of wide Lycia honoured him with a"
4606,ARGUMENT.,"willing mind. Nine days did he entertain him hospitably, and sacrificed"
4607,ARGUMENT.,"nine oxen; but when the tenth rosy-fingered morn appeared, then indeed"
4608,ARGUMENT.,"he interrogated him, and desired to see the token, 243 whatever it was,"
4609,ARGUMENT.,that he brought from his son-in-law Prœtus. But after he had received
4610,ARGUMENT.,"the fatal token of his son-in-law, first he commanded him to slay the"
4611,ARGUMENT.,"invincible Chimæra; but she was of divine race, not of men, in front a"
4612,ARGUMENT.,"lion, behind a dragon, in the middle a goat, 244 breathing forth the"
4613,ARGUMENT.,"dreadful might of gleaming fire. And her indeed he slew, relying on the"
4614,ARGUMENT.,signs of the gods. Next he fought with the illustrious Solymi: and he
4615,ARGUMENT.,"said that he entered on this as the fiercest fight among men. Thirdly,"
4616,ARGUMENT.,he slew the man-opposing Amazons. But for him returning the king wove
4617,ARGUMENT.,"another wily plot. Selecting the bravest men from wide Lycia, he placed"
4618,ARGUMENT.,"an ambuscade; but they never returned home again, for blameless"
4619,ARGUMENT.,Bellerophon slew them all. But when [Iobates] knew that he was the
4620,ARGUMENT.,"offspring of a god, he detained him there, and gave him his daughter:"
4621,ARGUMENT.,245 he also gave him half of all his regal honour. The Lycians also
4622,ARGUMENT.,"separated for him an enclosure of land, excelling all others, pleasant,"
4623,ARGUMENT.,"vine-bearing, and arable, that he might cultivate it. But this woman"
4624,ARGUMENT.,"brought forth three children to warlike Bellerophon, Isandrus,"
4625,ARGUMENT.,"Hippolochus, and Laodamia. Provident Jove, indeed, had clandestine"
4626,ARGUMENT.,"intercourse with Laodamia, and she brought forth godlike, brazen-helmed"
4627,ARGUMENT.,Sarpedon. But when now even he [Bellerophon] was become odious to all
4628,ARGUMENT.,"the gods, he, on his part, wandered alone 246 through the Aleïan plain,"
4629,ARGUMENT.,"247 pining in his soul, and shunning the path of men. But Mars,"
4630,ARGUMENT.,"insatiable of war, slew his son Isandrus, fighting against the"
4631,ARGUMENT.,"illustrious Solymi. And golden-reined Diana, being enraged, slew his"
4632,ARGUMENT.,"daughter. But Hippolochus begat me, and from him I say that I am born;"
4633,ARGUMENT.,"me he sent to Troy, and gave me very many commands, always to fight"
4634,ARGUMENT.,"bravely, and to be superior to others; and not to disgrace the race of"

4676,ARGUMENT.,
4677,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he said: and Diomede, valiant in the din of war, rejoiced. His"
4678,ARGUMENT.,"spear indeed he fixed in the all-nurturing earth, and next addressed"
4679,ARGUMENT.,the shepherd of the people in courteous words:
4680,ARGUMENT.,
4681,ARGUMENT.,“Certainly thou art my father’s ancient guest; for in his halls noble
4682,ARGUMENT.,"Œneus once entertained blameless Bellerophon, having detained him for"
4683,ARGUMENT.,twenty days; and they bestowed valuable gifts of hospitality on each
4684,ARGUMENT.,other. Œneus on his part gave a belt shining with purple; and
4685,ARGUMENT.,Bellerophon in turn a golden double cup; and this I left in my halls
4686,ARGUMENT.,"when I was coming hither. But Tydeus I remember not, for he left me"
4687,ARGUMENT.,"whilst I was yet young, when the people of the Greeks perished at"
4688,ARGUMENT.,"Thebes. Wherefore I am a guest friend to thee in the midst of Argos,"
4689,ARGUMENT.,"and thou art the same to me in Lycia, whenever I shall visit their"
4690,ARGUMENT.,state. But let us also in the crowd avoid even each other’s spears. For
4691,ARGUMENT.,"there are many Trojans and illustrious allies for me to slay,"
4692,ARGUMENT.,"whomsoever the deity shall present, and I shall overtake with my feet."
4693,ARGUMENT.,"And there are many Greeks in turn for thee to slay, whomsoever thou"
4694,ARGUMENT.,"canst. But let us exchange arms with each other, that even these may"
4695,ARGUMENT.,know that we profess to be friends by our ancestors.”
4696,ARGUMENT.,
4697,ARGUMENT.,"Thus then having spoken, leaping down from their steeds, they took each"
4698,ARGUMENT.,"other’s hand, and plighted faith. Then Saturnian Jove took away"
4699,ARGUMENT.,"prudence from Glaucus, who exchanged armour with Diomede, the son of"
4700,ARGUMENT.,"Tydeus, [giving] golden [arms] for brazen; the value of a hundred"
4701,ARGUMENT.,beeves 248 for the value of nine.
4702,ARGUMENT.,
4703,ARGUMENT.,"But when Hector arrived at the Scæan gates and the beech-tree, around"
4704,ARGUMENT.,"him ran the Trojan wives and daughters inquiring for their sons, their"
4705,ARGUMENT.,"brothers, their friends, and husbands. But he then ordered all in order"
4706,ARGUMENT.,"to supplicate the gods, for evils were impending over many."
4707,ARGUMENT.,
4708,ARGUMENT.,"But when now he had arrived at the very beautiful dwelling of Priam,"
4709,ARGUMENT.,built with well-polished porticoes; but in it were fifty chambers 249
4710,ARGUMENT.,"of polished marble, built near one another, where lay the sons of Priam"
4711,ARGUMENT.,"with their lawful wives; and opposite, on the other side, within the"
4712,ARGUMENT.,"hall, were the twelve roofed chambers of his daughters, of polished"
4713,ARGUMENT.,"marble, built near to one another, where the sons-in-law of Priam slept"
4714,ARGUMENT.,"with their chaste wives. There his fond mother met him, as she was"
4715,ARGUMENT.,"going to Laodice, the most excellent in form of her daughters: and she"
4716,ARGUMENT.,"hung upon his hand, and addressed him, and spoke:"
4717,ARGUMENT.,
4718,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 248: (return)  See Gellius, ii. 23. It must be remembered that"
4719,ARGUMENT.,"in the ancient times, when there was no money, cattle formed the"
4720,ARGUMENT.,standard of barter.

4723,ARGUMENT.,
4724,ARGUMENT.,"“My son, why hast thou come, having left the bold fight? Certainly the"
4725,ARGUMENT.,"abominable sons of the Greeks harass thee much, fighting around thy"
4726,ARGUMENT.,"city: thy mind hath urged thee to come hither, to uplift thy hands to"
4727,ARGUMENT.,"Jove from the lofty citadel. But wait till I bring thee genial wine,"
4728,ARGUMENT.,"that first thou mayest make a libation to Jove, and to the other"
4729,ARGUMENT.,"immortal gods, and then thou shalt refresh thyself, if thou wilt drink."
4730,ARGUMENT.,For to a wearied man wine greatly increases strength; since thou art
4731,ARGUMENT.,wearied aiding thy kinsmen.”
4732,ARGUMENT.,
4733,ARGUMENT.,But her mighty crest-tossing Hector then answered: “Bring me not genial
4734,ARGUMENT.,"wine, venerable mother, lest thou enervate me, and I forget my might"
4735,ARGUMENT.,and valour. But I dread to pour out dark-red wine to Jove with unwashed
4736,ARGUMENT.,"hands: nor is it by any means lawful for me, defiled with blood and"
4737,ARGUMENT.,"gore, to offer vows to the cloud-compelling son of Saturn. But go thou"
4738,ARGUMENT.,"to the temple of Minerva the pillager, with victims, having assembled"
4739,ARGUMENT.,the matrons of distinction. And the robe which is the most beautiful
4740,ARGUMENT.,"and the largest in the palace, and by far the most esteemed by thyself,"
4741,ARGUMENT.,"that place on the knees of the fair-haired goddess, and vow that thou"
4742,ARGUMENT.,"wilt sacrifice to her, in her temple, twelve heifers, yearlings,"
4743,ARGUMENT.,"ungoaded, if she will take compassion on the city, and the wives and"
4744,ARGUMENT.,infant children of the Trojans; if she will avert from sacred Ilium the
4745,ARGUMENT.,"son of Tydeus, that fierce warrior, the valiant author of terror. Do"
4746,ARGUMENT.,"thou, on thy part, go to the temple of the pillager Minerva; but I will"
4747,ARGUMENT.,"go after Paris, that I may call him, if he is willing to hear me"
4748,ARGUMENT.,"speaking. Would that the earth might there open for him, for him hath"
4749,ARGUMENT.,"Olympian Jove reared as a great bane to the Trojans, to magnanimous"
4750,ARGUMENT.,"Priam, and to his sons. Could I but behold him descending to Hades, I"
4751,ARGUMENT.,might say that my soul had forgotten its joyless woe.”
4752,ARGUMENT.,
4753,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke: but she, going to her palace, gave orders to her maids:"
4754,ARGUMENT.,and they assembled through the city the matrons of distinction. But she
4755,ARGUMENT.,"descended into her fragrant chamber, where were her"
4756,ARGUMENT.,"variously-embroidered robes, the works of Sidonian females, which"
4757,ARGUMENT.,"godlike Alexander himself had brought from Sidon, sailing over the"
4758,ARGUMENT.,"broad ocean, in that voyage in which he carried off Helen, sprung from"
4759,ARGUMENT.,"a noble sire. Hecuba, taking one of these which was most beauteous with"
4760,ARGUMENT.,"various hues, and largest, brought it as a gift to Minerva; and it"
4761,ARGUMENT.,"glittered like a star, and lay the undermost of all. But she hastened"
4762,ARGUMENT.,"to set out, and many venerable matrons hurried along with her."
4763,ARGUMENT.,
4764,ARGUMENT.,"But when they arrived at the temple of Minerva, in the lofty citadel,"
4765,ARGUMENT.,"fair-cheeked Theano, the daughter of Cisseus, wife of horse-breaking"
4766,ARGUMENT.,"Antenor, opened to them the gates; for the Trojans had made her"
4767,ARGUMENT.,"priestess of Minerva. They all, with a loud wailing, upraised their"
4768,ARGUMENT.,"hands to Minerva. But fair-cheeked Theano having received the garment,"
4769,ARGUMENT.,"placed it on the knees of fair-haired Minerva, and making vows, thus"
4770,ARGUMENT.,prayed to the daughter of mighty Jove:
4771,ARGUMENT.,
4772,ARGUMENT.,"“Venerable Minerva, guardian of the city, divine one of goddesses,"
4773,ARGUMENT.,"break now the spear of Diomede, and grant that he may fall prostrate"
4774,ARGUMENT.,"before the Scæan gates, that we may forthwith sacrifice to thee in thy"
4775,ARGUMENT.,"temple twelve yearling untamed heifers, if thou wilt pity the city, and"
4776,ARGUMENT.,"the wives of the Trojans, and their infant children.”"
4777,ARGUMENT.,
4778,ARGUMENT.,"So she spake in prayer, but Pallas Minerva refused. Thus they, on their"
4779,ARGUMENT.,"part, offered vows to the daughter of mighty Jove."
4780,ARGUMENT.,
4781,ARGUMENT.,"But Hector had gone to the beautiful halls of Alexander, which he"
4782,ARGUMENT.,"himself had built with the aid of men, who then were the most skilful"
4783,ARGUMENT.,"artificers in fruitful Troy: who made for him a chamber, a"
4784,ARGUMENT.,"dwelling-room, and hall, in the lofty citadel, near the palaces of"
4785,ARGUMENT.,"Priam and Hector. There Jove-beloved Hector entered, and in his hand he"
4786,ARGUMENT.,held a spear of eleven cubits; the brazen point of the spear shone in
4787,ARGUMENT.,"front, and a golden ring encircled it. But him he found in his chamber"
4788,ARGUMENT.,"preparing his very beauteous armour, his shield and corslet, and"
4789,ARGUMENT.,"fitting his curved bow. Argive Helen sat amongst her female servants,"
4790,ARGUMENT.,"and assigned their tasks to her maids of renowned work. But Hector,"
4791,ARGUMENT.,"seeing, reproached him with foul words:"
4792,ARGUMENT.,
4793,ARGUMENT.,“Infatuate; not befittingly hast thou conceived this rage in thy mind:
4794,ARGUMENT.,"the people are perishing, fighting around the city and the lofty wall:"
4795,ARGUMENT.,and on thy account the battle and war are blazing around the city.
4796,ARGUMENT.,"Truly thou wouldst thyself reprove another, if ever thou sawest any"
4797,ARGUMENT.,"person remiss in the hateful battle. But arise, lest perchance the city"
4798,ARGUMENT.,should quickly blaze with hostile fire.”
4799,ARGUMENT.,
4800,ARGUMENT.,"But him godlike Alexander then addressed: “Hector, since thou hast with"
4801,ARGUMENT.,"reason reproved me, and not without reason, therefore will I tell thee;"
4802,ARGUMENT.,"but do thou attend and hear me. I was sitting in my chamber, neither so"
4803,ARGUMENT.,"much from anger nor indignation against the Trojans, but [because] I"
4804,ARGUMENT.,"wished to give way to grief. But now my wife, advising me with soothing"
4805,ARGUMENT.,"words, hath urged me to the battle, and to myself also it seems to be"
4806,ARGUMENT.,"better: for victory alternates to men. But come now, wait, let me put"
4807,ARGUMENT.,"on my martial arms; or go on, and I will follow, and I think that I"
4808,ARGUMENT.,shall overtake thee.”
4809,ARGUMENT.,
4810,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he said, but crest-tossing Hector did not answer him. But Helen"
4811,ARGUMENT.,"addressed him [Hector] with soothing words: “Brother-in-law of me,"
4812,ARGUMENT.,"shameless authoress of mischief-devising, fearful wretch, would that,"
4813,ARGUMENT.,"on the day when first my mother brought me forth, a destructive tempest"
4814,ARGUMENT.,"of wind had seized and borne me to a mountain, or into the waves of the"
4815,ARGUMENT.,"much-resounding ocean, where the billow would have swept me away before"
4816,ARGUMENT.,these doings had occurred. But since the gods have thus decreed these
4817,ARGUMENT.,"evils, I ought at least to have been the wife of a braver man, who"
4818,ARGUMENT.,understood both the indignation and the many reproaches of men. But
4819,ARGUMENT.,"this man’s sentiments are neither constant now, nor will they be"
4820,ARGUMENT.,hereafter; wherefore I think he will reap the fruits [of them]. But
4821,ARGUMENT.,"come now, enter, and sit on this seat, brother-in-law, since toils have"
4822,ARGUMENT.,"greatly encompassed thy mind, on account of shameless me, and of the"
4823,ARGUMENT.,"guilt of Alexander; on whom Jove hath imposed an unhappy lot, that,"
4824,ARGUMENT.,"even in time to come, we should be a subject of song to future men.”"
4825,ARGUMENT.,
4826,ARGUMENT.,"But her mighty crest-tossing Hector then answered: “Do not bid me sit,"
4827,ARGUMENT.,"Helen, though courteous, for thou wilt not persuade me. For now is my"
4828,ARGUMENT.,"mind urged on, that I may aid the Trojans, who have great regret for me"
4829,ARGUMENT.,"absent. But do thou arouse him [Paris], and let him hasten, that he may"
4830,ARGUMENT.,"overtake me being within the city. For I will go home, that I may see"
4831,ARGUMENT.,"my domestics, my beloved wife, and my infant son. For I know not"
4832,ARGUMENT.,"whether I shall ever again return to them, or whether the gods will now"
4833,ARGUMENT.,subdue me under the hands of the Greeks.”
4834,ARGUMENT.,
4835,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having said, crest-tossing Hector departed; and immediately he"
4836,ARGUMENT.,"then arrived at his well-situated palace, nor did he find white-armed"
4837,ARGUMENT.,Andromache in the halls; but she stood lamenting and weeping on the
4838,ARGUMENT.,"tower, with her son and her well-robed maid. But Hector, when he found"
4839,ARGUMENT.,"not his blameless wife within, went and stood at the threshold, and"
4840,ARGUMENT.,said to the female servants:
4841,ARGUMENT.,
4842,ARGUMENT.,"“I pray you, maids, tell me truly whither went white-armed Andromache"
4843,ARGUMENT.,from the palace? Has she gone anywhere [to the dwellings] of her
4844,ARGUMENT.,"husband’s sisters, or [to those] of any of her well-robed"
4845,ARGUMENT.,"brother-in-laws’ wives, or to the temple of Minerva, where the other"
4846,ARGUMENT.,fair-haired Trojan matrons are appeasing the dreadful goddess?”
4847,ARGUMENT.,
4848,ARGUMENT.,"Him then the active housewife in turn addressed: “Hector, since thou"
4849,ARGUMENT.,"biddest me to tell the truth, she has not gone to any of her husband’s"
4850,ARGUMENT.,"sisters, nor to any of her well-robed brother-in-laws’ wives, nor to"
4851,ARGUMENT.,"the temple of Minerva, where the other fair-haired Trojan matrons are"
4852,ARGUMENT.,appeasing the dreadful goddess. But she went to the lofty tower of
4853,ARGUMENT.,"Ilium, when she heard that the Trojans were worn out, and that the"
4854,ARGUMENT.,"valour of the Greeks was great. She is now on her way, hastening to the"
4855,ARGUMENT.,"wall, like unto one frenzied, and the nurse, along with her, bears the"
4856,ARGUMENT.,child.”
4857,ARGUMENT.,
4858,ARGUMENT.,"Thus spoke the housewife, but Hector hastened away from the palace,"
4859,ARGUMENT.,back the same way through the well-built streets. When he had arrived
4860,ARGUMENT.,"at the Scæan gates, after passing through the great city (for by this"
4861,ARGUMENT.,"way he was about to pass out into the plain), there met him his"
4862,ARGUMENT.,"richly-dowered spouse running, Andromache, daughter of magnanimous"
4863,ARGUMENT.,"Eetion: Eetion, who dwelt in woody Hypoplacus, in Hypoplacian Thebes,"
4864,ARGUMENT.,reigning over Cilician men. His daughter then was possessed by
4865,ARGUMENT.,"brazen-helmed Hector. She then met him; and with her came a maid,"
4866,ARGUMENT.,"carrying in her bosom the tender child, an infant quite, the only son"
4867,ARGUMENT.,"of Hector, like unto a beauteous star. Him Hector had named"
4868,ARGUMENT.,"Scamandrius, but others Astyanax; for Hector alone protected Ilium. He"
4869,ARGUMENT.,"indeed, gazing in silence upon his son, smiled. But Andromache stood"
4870,ARGUMENT.,"near to him, weeping, and she hung upon his hand, and addressed him,"
4871,ARGUMENT.,and spoke:
4872,ARGUMENT.,
4873,ARGUMENT.,“Strange man! this thy valour will destroy thee; nor dost thou pity thy
4874,ARGUMENT.,"infant child and unhappy me, who very soon will be bereft of thee, for"
4875,ARGUMENT.,"presently the Greeks will slay thee, all attacking thee at once. For me"
4876,ARGUMENT.,"much better it were to sink into the earth, when bereft of thee; for"
4877,ARGUMENT.,there will no longer be any other comfort for me when thou shalt draw
4878,ARGUMENT.,on thy destruction; but sorrows only. Nor have I father or venerable
4879,ARGUMENT.,"mother. For divine Achilles slew my father, and laid waste the"
4880,ARGUMENT.,"well-inhabited city of the Cilicians, lofty-gated Thebes. He slew"
4881,ARGUMENT.,"Eetion, but spoiled him not, he scrupled in his mind [to do] that; but"
4882,ARGUMENT.,"he burned him together with his well-wrought arms, and heaped a tomb"
4883,ARGUMENT.,"over him, and around [him] the mountain nymphs, daughters of"
4884,ARGUMENT.,"ægis-bearing Jove, planted elms. Moreover, the seven brothers besides,"
4885,ARGUMENT.,"whom I had at home, all these indeed departed to Hades in one day. For"
4886,ARGUMENT.,"divine, swift-footed Achilles slew them all, amidst their crooked"
4887,ARGUMENT.,"hoofed oxen and their snowy sheep. And my mother, who ruled in woody"
4888,ARGUMENT.,"Hypoplacus, after that he had led her hither with other treasures, he"
4889,ARGUMENT.,"sent back at liberty, having received countless ransom-gifts. But her"
4890,ARGUMENT.,"the shaft-rejoicing Diana slew in my father’s hall. But, Ο Hector, to"
4891,ARGUMENT.,me thou art both father and venerable mother and brother; thou art also
4892,ARGUMENT.,"my blooming consort. But come now, pity me, and abide here in the"
4893,ARGUMENT.,"tower, nor make thy child an orphan and thy wife a widow. And place a"
4894,ARGUMENT.,"company at the wild fig-tree, where the city is chiefly easy of ascent,"
4895,ARGUMENT.,"and the wall can be scaled. For going to this very quarter, the bravest"
4896,ARGUMENT.,"[of the Greeks] have thrice assaulted, the two Ajaces, and most"
4897,ARGUMENT.,"renowned Idomeneus, and the sons of Atreus, and the brave son of"
4898,ARGUMENT.,Tydeus. Certainly some person well skilled in prophecy mentioned it to
4899,ARGUMENT.,"them, or their own mind impels and orders them.”"
4900,ARGUMENT.,
4901,ARGUMENT.,But her then in turn the mighty crest-tossing Hector addressed:
4902,ARGUMENT.,"“Assuredly to me also are all these things a subject of anxiety, dear"
4903,ARGUMENT.,"wife, but I am exceedingly ashamed of the Trojans and the long-robed"
4904,ARGUMENT.,"Trojan dames, if I, like a dastard, [keeping] aloof, should avoid the"
4905,ARGUMENT.,"battle: nor does my mind incline me thus, for I have learned to be"
4906,ARGUMENT.,"always brave, and to fight in the foremost among the Trojans, seeking"
4907,ARGUMENT.,to gain both my father’s great glory and mine own. For well I know this
4908,ARGUMENT.,"in my mind and soul; a day will arrive when sacred Ilium shall perish,"
4909,ARGUMENT.,"and Priam, and the people of Priam skilled in the ashen spear. But to"
4910,ARGUMENT.,me the grief that is to come will not be so great on account of the
4911,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans, neither for Hecuba herself, nor for king Priam, nor for my"
4912,ARGUMENT.,"brothers, who, many and excellent, are destined to fall in the dust"
4913,ARGUMENT.,"beneath hostile men, as for thee, when some one of the brazen-mailed"
4914,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks shall lead thee away weeping, having deprived thee of the day of"
4915,ARGUMENT.,"freedom. And, perchance, being in Argos, thou mayest weave the web at"
4916,ARGUMENT.,"the command of some other dame, and bear water from the fountain of"
4917,ARGUMENT.,"Messeïs, or Hyperia, very unwillingly; and hard necessity will oppress"
4918,ARGUMENT.,"thee; whilst some one, hereafter beholding thee pouring forth tears,"
4919,ARGUMENT.,"will say, ‘This was the wife of Hector, who was the bravest in battle"
4920,ARGUMENT.,"of the horse-breaking Trojans, when they fought round Ilium.’ Thus will"
4921,ARGUMENT.,"some one hereafter say; but fresh anguish will be thine, from the want"
4922,ARGUMENT.,"of such a husband, to avert the day of servitude. But may the heaped"
4923,ARGUMENT.,"earth cover me dead, before I hear of this lamentation and abduction.”"
4924,ARGUMENT.,
4925,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having said, illustrious Hector stretched out [his arms] for his"
4926,ARGUMENT.,"son; but the child, screaming, shrunk back to the bosom of the"
4927,ARGUMENT.,"well-zoned nurse, affrighted at the aspect of his dear sire, fearing"
4928,ARGUMENT.,"the brass and the horse-haired crest, seeing it nodding dreadfully from"
4929,ARGUMENT.,"the top of the helmet: gently his loving father smiled, and his revered"
4930,ARGUMENT.,"mother. Instantly illustrious Hector took the helmet from his head, and"
4931,ARGUMENT.,laid it all-glittering on the ground; and having kissed his beloved
4932,ARGUMENT.,"child, and fondled him in his hands, thus spoke, praying to Jove and to"
4933,ARGUMENT.,the other gods:
4934,ARGUMENT.,
4935,ARGUMENT.,"“Jove, and ye other gods, grant that this my son also may become, even"
4936,ARGUMENT.,"as I am, distinguished amongst the Trojans, so powerful in might, and"
4937,ARGUMENT.,bravely to rule over Ilium. And may some one hereafter say [concerning
4938,ARGUMENT.,"him], returning from the fight, ‘He indeed is much braver than his"
4939,ARGUMENT.,"sire.’ And let him bear away the bloody spoils, having slain the foe,"
4940,ARGUMENT.,and let his mother rejoice in her soul.”
4941,ARGUMENT.,
4942,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having said, he placed the boy in the hands of his beloved spouse;"
4943,ARGUMENT.,but she smiling tearfully received him in her fragrant bosom. Her
4944,ARGUMENT.,"husband regarding her, pitied her, and soothed her with his hand, and"
4945,ARGUMENT.,"addressed her, and said:"
4946,ARGUMENT.,
4947,ARGUMENT.,"“Beloved, be not at all too sad in thine heart on my account. For no"
4948,ARGUMENT.,man shall send me prematurely to the shades. But I think there is no
4949,ARGUMENT.,"one of men who has escaped fate, neither the coward nor the brave man,"
4950,ARGUMENT.,"after he has once been born. But do thou, going home, take care of thy"
4951,ARGUMENT.,"own works, thy web and distaff, and command thy maids to perform their"
4952,ARGUMENT.,"task; but war shall be a care to all the men who are born in Ilium, and"
4953,ARGUMENT.,particularly to me.”
4954,ARGUMENT.,
4955,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having spoken, illustrious Hector took up the horse-haired helmet,"
4956,ARGUMENT.,"and his beloved wife departed home, looking back from time to time, and"
4957,ARGUMENT.,shedding copious tears. Then immediately she reached the very
4958,ARGUMENT.,"commodious palace of man-slaying Hector, and within she found many"
4959,ARGUMENT.,"maids, and in all of them she excited grief. They, indeed, bewailed in"
4960,ARGUMENT.,"his own palace Hector still alive, for they thought that he would never"
4961,ARGUMENT.,"return back again from battle, escaping the might and the hands of the"
4962,ARGUMENT.,Greeks.
4963,ARGUMENT.,
4964,ARGUMENT.,"Nor did Paris delay in his lofty halls; but he, after he had put on his"
4965,ARGUMENT.,"famous arms, variegated with brass, then hastened through the city,"
4966,ARGUMENT.,"relying on his swift feet. And as 250 when a stabled courser, fed with"
4967,ARGUMENT.,"barley at the stall, having broken his cord, runs prancing over the"
4968,ARGUMENT.,"plain, elate with joy, being accustomed to bathe in some fair-flowing"
4969,ARGUMENT.,"river. He bears aloft his head, and his mane is tossed about on his"
4970,ARGUMENT.,"shoulders: but he, relying on his beauty, 251 his knees easily bear him"
4971,ARGUMENT.,"to the accustomed pastures 252 of the mares. Thus Paris, the son of"
4972,ARGUMENT.,"Priam, shining in arms like the sun, exulting descended down from the"
4973,ARGUMENT.,"citadel of Pergamus, but his swift feet bore him, and immediately after"
4974,ARGUMENT.,"he found his noble brother Hector, when he was now about to depart from"
4975,ARGUMENT.,the place where he was conversing with his spouse.

5051,ARGUMENT.,"Apollo, the son of Jove, addressed:"

5053,ARGUMENT.,"“Why again dost thou, O daughter of mighty Jove, come ardently from"
5054,ARGUMENT.,"Olympus, and why has thy mighty soul impelled thee? It is that thou"

5056,ARGUMENT.,"dost not pity the Trojans perishing. But if thou obeyest me in aught,"
5057,ARGUMENT.,"which indeed would be much better, let us now make the war and conflict"
5058,ARGUMENT.,"to cease this day, afterwards shall they fight until they find an end"

5074,ARGUMENT.,intend to make the battle of men to cease?”
5075,ARGUMENT.,
5076,ARGUMENT.,"Her then in turn king Apollo, the son of Jove, addressed: “Let us"

5078,ARGUMENT.,will challenge some one of the Greeks to fight against him singly
5079,ARGUMENT.,opposed in grievous combat. And the well-greaved Greeks enraged will
5080,ARGUMENT.,urge on some single man to fight with noble Hector.”
5081,ARGUMENT.,
5082,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke, nor did the azure-eyed goddess disobey. But Helenus, the"
5083,ARGUMENT.,"dear son of Priam, perceived in his mind the counsel, which seemed good"
5084,ARGUMENT.,"to the gods deliberating. He therefore went and stood near Hector, and"
5085,ARGUMENT.,thus accosted him:
5086,ARGUMENT.,
5087,ARGUMENT.,"“Hector, son of Priam, equal to Jove in wisdom, wilt thou obey me in"
5088,ARGUMENT.,aught? for I am thy brother. Cause all the rest of the Trojans and the
5089,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks to sit down, but do thou thyself challenge whoever is the"
5090,ARGUMENT.,bravest of the Greeks to fight against thee in grievous combat. For it
5091,ARGUMENT.,"is not yet thy fate to die, and draw on fate; for to this effect have I"
5092,ARGUMENT.,heard the voice of the immortal gods.”
5093,ARGUMENT.,
5094,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke. But Hector in turn rejoiced exceedingly, having heard"
5095,ARGUMENT.,"his advice, and accordingly advancing into the midst, grasping his"
5096,ARGUMENT.,"spear in the middle, he restrained the phalanxes of the Trojans; and"
5097,ARGUMENT.,they all sat down. Agamemnon also caused the well-greaved Greeks to sit
5098,ARGUMENT.,"down; and Minerva also, and silver-bowed Apollo, sat like unto vulture"
5099,ARGUMENT.,"birds, on a lofty beech-tree of their sire, the ægis-bearing Jove,"
5100,ARGUMENT.,"delighted with the heroes; of these the ranks sat thick, horribly"
5101,ARGUMENT.,"bristling with shields, and helmets, and spears. And as the ripple of"
5102,ARGUMENT.,"the west wind, just risen, is poured over the ocean, and the sea begins"
5103,ARGUMENT.,"to darken under it, such sat the ranks of the Greeks and Trojans in the"
5104,ARGUMENT.,plain: but Hector thus spoke in the midst of both armies:
5105,ARGUMENT.,
5106,ARGUMENT.,"“Hear me, ye Trojans, and ye well-greaved Greeks, whilst I speak what"
5107,ARGUMENT.,"the mind in my breast commands me. Saturnian Jove, indeed, sitting"
5108,ARGUMENT.,"aloft, has not ratified the leagues, but devising evils against both"
5109,ARGUMENT.,"sides, ordains them, till either ye take well-turreted Troy, or"
5110,ARGUMENT.,"yourselves fall at your sea-traversing ships. Amongst you, indeed,"
5111,ARGUMENT.,"there are the bravest of all the Greeks, of whom whomsoever his mind"
5112,ARGUMENT.,"orders to fight with me, let him come hither from amongst all, to be a"
5113,ARGUMENT.,"champion against noble Hector. This then do I propose, but let Jove be"
5114,ARGUMENT.,"our witness; if, on the one hand, he shall slay me with his"
5115,ARGUMENT.,"long-pointed spear, having stripped off my armour, let him bear it to"
5116,ARGUMENT.,"the hollow ships, but send my body home, that the Trojans and the wives"
5117,ARGUMENT.,"of the Trojans may make me, deceased, a partaker of the funeral pyre."
5118,ARGUMENT.,"But if, on the other hand, I shall slay him, and Apollo shall give me"
5119,ARGUMENT.,"glory, having stripped off his armour, I will bear it to sacred Ilium,"
5120,ARGUMENT.,and I will hang it up on the temple of far-darting Apollo: but his body
5121,ARGUMENT.,"I will send back to the well-benched ships, that the long-haired Greeks"
5122,ARGUMENT.,"may perform his exsequies, and pile up for him a tomb on the wide"
5123,ARGUMENT.,"Hellespont. And hereafter will some one of future men say, as he sails"
5124,ARGUMENT.,"over the sea in his many-benched ship: ‘This, indeed, is the tomb of a"
5125,ARGUMENT.,"hero long since deceased, whom once, bearing himself doughtily,"
5126,ARGUMENT.,illustrious Hector slew.’ Thus hereafter will some one say; but this my
5127,ARGUMENT.,glory shall never perish.”
5128,ARGUMENT.,
5129,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he said, but all became mute in silence. Ashamed indeed they were"
5130,ARGUMENT.,"to refuse, and yet they dreaded to accept [the challenge]. At length,"
5131,ARGUMENT.,"however, Menelaus stood up, and spoke amongst them, rebuking them with"
5132,ARGUMENT.,"reproaches, and he groaned greatly in spirit:"
5133,ARGUMENT.,
5134,ARGUMENT.,“Alas! ye boasters! Greek dames! no longer Grecian men! certainly will
5135,ARGUMENT.,"these things be a disgrace, most grievously grievous, if none of the"
5136,ARGUMENT.,Greeks will now go against Hector. But may ye all become water and
5137,ARGUMENT.,"earth, sitting there each of you, faint-hearted; utterly inglorious:"
5138,ARGUMENT.,but I myself will be armed against him. But the issues of victory are
5139,ARGUMENT.,rested in the immortal gods.”
5140,ARGUMENT.,
5141,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having spoken, he put on his beautiful arms. Then, indeed, Ο"
5142,ARGUMENT.,"Menelaus, would the end of life have befallen thee at the hands of"
5143,ARGUMENT.,"Hector, since he was much the better man, had not the princes of the"
5144,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks, starting up suddenly, restrained thee, and the son of Atreus"
5145,ARGUMENT.,"himself, wide-ruling Agamemnon, seized thee by the right hand, and"
5146,ARGUMENT.,"addressed thee, and spoke:"
5147,ARGUMENT.,
5148,ARGUMENT.,"“Thou art mad, O Menelaus! offspring of Jove, nor hast thou any need of"
5149,ARGUMENT.,"such madness: restrain thyself, although grieved, nor wish for the sake"
5150,ARGUMENT.,"of contention to fight with a braver man than thyself, Hector, the son"
5151,ARGUMENT.,"of Priam, whom others also dread. Nay, even Achilles, who is much"
5152,ARGUMENT.,"braver than thou, dreads to meet him 256 in the glorious fight. But"
5153,ARGUMENT.,"now, going to the troop of thy companions, sit down. Against him the"
5154,ARGUMENT.,Greeks will set up some other champion. Although he be intrepid and
5155,ARGUMENT.,"insatiable of battle, I think that he will gladly bend his knee, 257 if"
5156,ARGUMENT.,he shall escape from the hostile battle and the grievous fight.”

5166,ARGUMENT.,"Thus speaking, the hero dissuaded his brother’s mind, advising him"
5167,ARGUMENT.,rightly; and he obeyed. His joyful attendants then stripped the armour
5168,ARGUMENT.,"from his shoulders. Then Nestor arose amidst the Greeks, and said:"
5169,ARGUMENT.,
5170,ARGUMENT.,"“O gods, surely great grief comes upon the Grecian land. Certainly the"
5171,ARGUMENT.,"aged knight Peleus, the excellent counsellor and adviser of the"
5172,ARGUMENT.,"Myrmidons, will greatly lament, who formerly interrogated me, greatly"
5173,ARGUMENT.,"rejoiced in his palace, inquiring the race and offspring of all the"
5174,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks. If he now heard of them all crouching down under Hector, often"
5175,ARGUMENT.,"indeed would he uplift his hands to the immortals, [praying] that his"
5176,ARGUMENT.,"soul, [separated] from his limbs, might depart into the house of Pluto."
5177,ARGUMENT.,"For would, Ο father Jove, and Minerva, and Apollo, I were young, as"
5178,ARGUMENT.,when the assembled Pylians and the spear-skilled Arcadians fought by
5179,ARGUMENT.,"the rapid Celadon, at the walls of Phæa, about the streams of Jardan."
5180,ARGUMENT.,"With them Ereuthalion, god-like hero, stood in the van, bearing on his"
5181,ARGUMENT.,"shoulders the armour of king Areïthous, of noble Areïthous, whom men"
5182,ARGUMENT.,"and beauteous-girt women called by surname Corynetes, since he fought"
5183,ARGUMENT.,"not with a bow, nor with a long spear, but used to break the phalanxes"
5184,ARGUMENT.,"with an iron club. Him Lycurgus slew by stratagem, not by strength, in"
5185,ARGUMENT.,"a narrow defile, where his iron club did not ward off destruction from"
5186,ARGUMENT.,"him; for Lycurgus, anticipating, pierced him right through the waist"
5187,ARGUMENT.,"with his spear, and he was dashed to the ground on his back; and he"
5188,ARGUMENT.,"spoiled him of the armour which brazen Mars had given him, and he"
5189,ARGUMENT.,indeed afterwards bore them himself in the battle of Mars. But when
5190,ARGUMENT.,"Lycurgus had grown old in his palaces, he gave them to his beloved"
5191,ARGUMENT.,"attendant Ereuthalion, to be borne: and he, having his armour,"
5192,ARGUMENT.,challenged all the bravest: but these trembled and feared very much:
5193,ARGUMENT.,"nor did any one dare [to withstand him]. But my bold mind, by its"
5194,ARGUMENT.,"confidence, urged me on to fight him: now I was the youngest of them"
5195,ARGUMENT.,"all; and I fought with him, and Minerva gave me glory. And I slew this"
5196,ARGUMENT.,"most mighty and valiant hero, for vast he lay stretched out on this"
5197,ARGUMENT.,"side and on that. Would that [now] I were thus young, and my strength"
5198,ARGUMENT.,entire—so quickly should crest-tossing Hector meet with a contest. But
5199,ARGUMENT.,"those of you who are the bravest of all the Greeks, not even you"
5200,ARGUMENT.,promptly desire to go against Hector.”
5201,ARGUMENT.,
5202,ARGUMENT.,Thus did the old man upbraid them; and nine heroes in all arose. Much
5203,ARGUMENT.,"the first arose Agamemnon, the king of men; after him arose brave"
5204,ARGUMENT.,"Diomede, son of Tydeus, and after them the Ajaces, clad in impetuous"
5205,ARGUMENT.,"valour: after them Idomeneus, and Meriones, the armour-bearer of"
5206,ARGUMENT.,"Idomeneus, equal to man-slaughtering Mars. After them Eurypylus, the"
5207,ARGUMENT.,"gallant son of Evæmon. And there [also arose] Thoas, son of Andræmon,"
5208,ARGUMENT.,and divine Ulysses. All these wished to fight with noble Hector. But
5209,ARGUMENT.,these again the Gerenian knight Nestor addressed:
5210,ARGUMENT.,
5211,ARGUMENT.,"“Decide now, exclusively by lot, who shall obtain [the accepting of the"
5212,ARGUMENT.,challenge]; for he indeed will aid the well-greaved Greeks; and he will
5213,ARGUMENT.,"also delight his own soul, if he shall escape safe from the hostile war"
5214,ARGUMENT.,and the grievous fight.”
5215,ARGUMENT.,
5216,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke, and they marked each his own lot, and they cast them"
5217,ARGUMENT.,"into the helmet of Agamemnon, the son of Atreus. The people"
5218,ARGUMENT.,"supplicated, and raised their hands to the gods, and thus would one of"
5219,ARGUMENT.,"them say, looking towards the wide heaven:"
5220,ARGUMENT.,
5221,ARGUMENT.,"“Ο father Jove, grant that Ajax obtain the lot, or the son of Tydeus,"
5222,ARGUMENT.,or the king himself of rich Mycenæ.”
5223,ARGUMENT.,
5224,ARGUMENT.,"Thus they spake, and the Gerenian knight Nestor shook [the lots], and"
5225,ARGUMENT.,"the lot of Ajax, which indeed they wished for, leaped forth from the"
5226,ARGUMENT.,"helmet. Then a herald bearing it around through the multitude,"
5227,ARGUMENT.,"beginning at the right, showed it to all the chiefs of the Greeks. But"
5228,ARGUMENT.,"they, not recognizing it, disclaimed it severally. But, when at last"
5229,ARGUMENT.,"the herald, carrying it round through the multitude, came to him,"
5230,ARGUMENT.,"illustrious Ajax, who had inscribed and cast it into the helmet, he"
5231,ARGUMENT.,"[Ajax] stretched forth his hand, and the herald standing near, placed"
5232,ARGUMENT.,"it in it. Having inspected it, he knew his own mark, and rejoiced in"
5233,ARGUMENT.,"his soul. He cast it on the ground at his feet, and said:"
5234,ARGUMENT.,
5235,ARGUMENT.,"“Ο friends, surely the lot is mine, and I myself rejoice in my soul,"
5236,ARGUMENT.,"since I think that I shall conquer noble Hector. But come, while I put"
5237,ARGUMENT.,"on my warlike arms, do ye meantime pray to Jove, the Saturnian king,"
5238,ARGUMENT.,"silently within yourselves, that the Trojans may not hear; or even"
5239,ARGUMENT.,"openly, since we fear no one at all. For no one willingly shall, by"
5240,ARGUMENT.,"force, overcome me against my will, nor through my inexperience; since"
5241,ARGUMENT.,I hope I have not been so ignorantly 258 born and bred at Salamis.”
5242,ARGUMENT.,
5243,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 258: (return)  I. e. ignorant of arms.
5244,ARGUMENT.,
5245,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke: but they prayed to Jove, the Saturnian king; and thus"
5246,ARGUMENT.,would one of them say looking towards the wide heaven:
5247,ARGUMENT.,
5248,ARGUMENT.,"“O father Jove, ruling from Ida, most glorious, most mighty, grant to"
5249,ARGUMENT.,"Ajax to bear away victory, and illustrious glory. But if thou lovest"
5250,ARGUMENT.,"Hector also, and carest for him, grant equal might and glory to both.”"
5251,ARGUMENT.,
5252,ARGUMENT.,"Thus they spake, and Ajax was arming himself in splendid brass. But"
5253,ARGUMENT.,"when he had put on all his armour around his body, then he rushed"
5254,ARGUMENT.,"forward: as moves mighty Mars, who goes to war amidst men, whom the son"
5255,ARGUMENT.,of Saturn has engaged to fight with the strength of soul-gnawing
5256,ARGUMENT.,"strife, such mighty Ajax advanced, the bulwark of the Greeks, smiling"
5257,ARGUMENT.,"with grim countenance; but he advanced, taking long strides with his"
5258,ARGUMENT.,"feet beneath, brandishing his long-shadowed spear. The Greeks, on their"
5259,ARGUMENT.,"part, rejoiced much on beholding him, but dire dismay seized the"
5260,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans, each one as to his limbs, and the soul panted in the breast of"
5261,ARGUMENT.,"Hector himself. But now he could not in anywise retract through fear,"
5262,ARGUMENT.,"nor retire back into the crowd of the people, since he had challenged"
5263,ARGUMENT.,"to the fight. But Ajax drew near, bearing a shield, like a tower,"
5264,ARGUMENT.,"brazen, covered with seven ox-hides, which for him the artist Tychius"
5265,ARGUMENT.,"labouring had wrought, dwelling at his home in Hyla, by far the most"
5266,ARGUMENT.,"excellent of leather-cutters, who for him had made a moveable shield,"
5267,ARGUMENT.,"of seven hides of very fat bulls, and drawn over it an eighth [layer]"
5268,ARGUMENT.,"of brass. Carrying this before his breast, Telamonian Ajax stood very"
5269,ARGUMENT.,"near Hector, and menacing addressed him:"
5270,ARGUMENT.,
5271,ARGUMENT.,"“Ο Hector, now thou, alone with me alone, shalt plainly know, what kind"
5272,ARGUMENT.,"of chiefs are present with the Greeks, even besides Achilles, the"
5273,ARGUMENT.,"breaker of ranks, the lion-hearted. But he, indeed, abides at his"
5274,ARGUMENT.,"high-beaked sea-traversing ships, enraged against Agamemnon, the"
5275,ARGUMENT.,"shepherd of the people. Yet we are such, even many of us, who can go"
5276,ARGUMENT.,against thee; but begin the battle and the strife.”
5277,ARGUMENT.,
5278,ARGUMENT.,Him then in turn the mighty crest-tossing Hector addressed: “Thou
5279,ARGUMENT.,"Jove-sprung Ajax, son of Telamon, ruler of forces, tamper not with me"
5280,ARGUMENT.,"as with a weak boy, or a woman, who knows not warlike deeds. But I well"
5281,ARGUMENT.,know both battles and man-slaughterings. I know how to shift my dry
5282,ARGUMENT.,shield to the right and to the left; wherefore to me it belongs to
5283,ARGUMENT.,fight unwearied. I am also skilled to rush to the battle of swift
5284,ARGUMENT.,"steeds. I know too, how, in hostile array, to move skilfully in honour"
5285,ARGUMENT.,"of glowing Mars. But I do not desire to wound thee, being such,"
5286,ARGUMENT.,"watching stealthily, but openly, if haply I may strike thee.”"
5287,ARGUMENT.,
5288,ARGUMENT.,"He spoke, and brandishing hurled forth his long-shadowed spear, and"
5289,ARGUMENT.,"smote the mighty seven-hided shield of Ajax on the outside brass, which"
5290,ARGUMENT.,was the eighth [layer] thereon. And the unwearied brass cutting
5291,ARGUMENT.,"through, penetrated six folds, and was stuck fast in the seventh hide."
5292,ARGUMENT.,"Next, Jove-sprung Ajax in turn sent forth his very long spear, and"
5293,ARGUMENT.,struck the all-equal shield of Priam’s son. Through the shining shield
5294,ARGUMENT.,"passed the impetuous spear, and was fastened in his very"
5295,ARGUMENT.,"ingeniously-wrought corslet, and from the opposite side the spear cut"
5296,ARGUMENT.,"his tunic near the flank. But he inclined himself, and avoided black"
5297,ARGUMENT.,"death. Then they both, having drawn out their long spears with their"
5298,ARGUMENT.,"hands, joined battle, like unto raw-devouring lions, or wild boars,"
5299,ARGUMENT.,whose strength is not feeble. Then indeed the son of Priam struck the
5300,ARGUMENT.,midst of his [Ajax’s] shield with his spear; it broke not through the
5301,ARGUMENT.,"brass, but the point of it was bent. But Ajax, bounding forward,"
5302,ARGUMENT.,"pierced his shield: and the spear went right through, and repelled him"
5303,ARGUMENT.,"as he rushed on: it glanced over his neck, cutting it, and black gore"
5304,ARGUMENT.,gushed forth. But not even thus did crest-tossing Hector cease from the
5305,ARGUMENT.,"battle: but retiring back, he seized in his hand, a black, rough, huge"
5306,ARGUMENT.,"stone, lying in the plain. With it he struck the mighty seven-hided"
5307,ARGUMENT.,"shield of Ajax, in the midst of the boss, and the brass rang around."
5308,ARGUMENT.,"Ajax next taking up a much larger stone, whirling, discharged it, and"
5309,ARGUMENT.,"applied immense strength. And he broke through the shield, having"
5310,ARGUMENT.,"struck with a rock like unto a millstone, and he wounded him in the"
5311,ARGUMENT.,"knee; and he was stretched supine, having come into violent contact"
5312,ARGUMENT.,with his shield; but Apollo quickly raised him. And now in close combat
5313,ARGUMENT.,"hand to hand, they would have wounded each other with their swords, had"
5314,ARGUMENT.,"not the heralds, the messengers of gods and men, arrived, one of the"
5315,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans, the other of the brazen-mailed Greeks, Talthybius and Idæus,"
5316,ARGUMENT.,"both prudent men. And between both armies they held their sceptres, but"
5317,ARGUMENT.,"the herald Idæus, skilled in prudent counsels, said:"
5318,ARGUMENT.,
5319,ARGUMENT.,"“No longer, my dear sons, war or fight, for cloud-collecting Jove loves"
5320,ARGUMENT.,"you both: ye both are warriors, and this we all know. Night is now"
5321,ARGUMENT.,"approaching, and it is good to obey night.” 259"

5327,ARGUMENT.,
5328,ARGUMENT.,
5329,ARGUMENT.,"But him Telamonian Ajax answering addressed: “Idæus, order Hector to"
5330,ARGUMENT.,"speak these words, for he challenged all the bravest [of our side] to"
5331,ARGUMENT.,"battle. Let him begin, and I will entirely obey, if indeed he does so.”"
5332,ARGUMENT.,
5333,ARGUMENT.,"But him crest-tossing Hector addressed in turn: “Ajax, since some god"
5334,ARGUMENT.,"has given thee size, and might, and prudence, and thou art the most"
5335,ARGUMENT.,"excellent of the Greeks at the spear, let us now cease from battle and"
5336,ARGUMENT.,"contest for this day; hereafter will we fight again, till the Deity"
5337,ARGUMENT.,"shall separate us, and give the victory to either. Now night is"
5338,ARGUMENT.,"approaching, and it is good to obey night, that thou mayest gladden all"
5339,ARGUMENT.,"the Greeks at the ships, and chiefly those friends and companions which"
5340,ARGUMENT.,are thine; but I will gladden the Trojans and the train-bearing Trojan
5341,ARGUMENT.,"matrons, through the great city of king Priam, the dames who, praying"
5342,ARGUMENT.,"for me, are entering the deities’ temple. 260 But come, let us both"

5353,ARGUMENT.,"Thus then having spoken, he gave him a silver-studded sword, presenting"
5354,ARGUMENT.,it with the sheath and the well-wrought belt. But Ajax gave [to him] a
5355,ARGUMENT.,"belt, splendid with purple. Then they twain being separated, the one"
5356,ARGUMENT.,"went to the people of the Greeks, and the other to the crowd of the"
5357,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans: and they rejoiced when they saw him coming alive and safe,"
5358,ARGUMENT.,having escaped the strength and the invincible hands of Ajax; and led
5359,ARGUMENT.,"him to the city, not having had any hopes that he was safe. But the"
5360,ARGUMENT.,"well-greaved Greeks, on the other hand, led away Ajax, rejoicing in"
5361,ARGUMENT.,"victory, to divine Agamemnon. When now they were in the tents of the"
5362,ARGUMENT.,"son of Atreus, then Agamemnon, king of men, sacrificed for them an ox,"
5363,ARGUMENT.,"a male, five years old, to the most powerful son of Saturn. This they"
5364,ARGUMENT.,"flayed, and dressed it; made divisions of the whole of it, and"
5365,ARGUMENT.,"skilfully divided these into smaller portions, and fixed them on spits,"
5366,ARGUMENT.,"and roasted them very cleverly, and drew off all. But when they had"
5367,ARGUMENT.,"ceased from labour, and had prepared the banquet, they feasted, nor did"
5368,ARGUMENT.,their soul in anywise lack a due proportion of the feast. The valiant
5369,ARGUMENT.,"son of Atreus, far-ruling Agamemnon, honoured Ajax with an entire"
5370,ARGUMENT.,"chine. 261 But when they had dismissed the desire of drink and of food,"
5371,ARGUMENT.,"for them the aged man Nestor first of all began to frame advice, whose"
5372,ARGUMENT.,"counsel before also had appeared the best, who, wisely counselling,"
5373,ARGUMENT.,"harangued them, and said:"

5377,ARGUMENT.,
5378,ARGUMENT.,"“Son of Atreus, and ye other chiefs of all the Greeks, many of the"
5379,ARGUMENT.,"long-haired Achæans have perished, whose black blood fierce Mars has"
5380,ARGUMENT.,"now shed near fair-flowing Scamander, and their souls have descended to"
5381,ARGUMENT.,the shades! Therefore it behoves you to cause the battle of the Greeks
5382,ARGUMENT.,"to cease with the dawn, and let us, collected together, carry the"
5383,ARGUMENT.,"bodies hither on chariots, with oxen and mules, and burn them at a"
5384,ARGUMENT.,"little distance from the ships, that each may carry home the bones [of"
5385,ARGUMENT.,"the deceased] to their children, when we return again to our"
5386,ARGUMENT.,"father-land. And let us, going out, heap up in the plain one common"
5387,ARGUMENT.,"tomb for all, round the pyre, and beside it let us speedily erect lofty"
5388,ARGUMENT.,"towers, as a bulwark of our ships and of ourselves; and in it let us"
5389,ARGUMENT.,"make a well-fitted gate, that through it there may be a passage for the"
5390,ARGUMENT.,"chariots. But outside let us sink, near at hand, a deep trench, which,"
5391,ARGUMENT.,"being circular, may serve as a defence to both steeds and men, lest at"
5392,ARGUMENT.,any time the war of the haughty Trojans should press sorely.”
5393,ARGUMENT.,
5394,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke, and all the princes approved of his counsel. But of the"
5395,ARGUMENT.,Trojans also was a panic-struck and turbulent council held in the lofty
5396,ARGUMENT.,"citadel of Ilium, at the gates of Priam; and to them wise Antenor thus"
5397,ARGUMENT.,began to harangue:
5398,ARGUMENT.,
5399,ARGUMENT.,"“Hear me, ye Trojans and Dardanians and allies, that I may tell you"
5400,ARGUMENT.,"what the soul in my breast commands me. Come then, let us restore"
5401,ARGUMENT.,"Argive Helen, and her treasures with her to the sons of Atreus to lead"
5402,ARGUMENT.,away; for now we are fighting after having violated the faithful
5403,ARGUMENT.,leagues. Wherefore I think that nothing better will be brought to pass
5404,ARGUMENT.,"by us, unless we act thus.”"
5405,ARGUMENT.,
5406,ARGUMENT.,"He, having thus said, sat down; but to them arose divine Alexander, the"
5407,ARGUMENT.,"husband of fair-haired Helen, who answering him spoke winged words:"
5408,ARGUMENT.,
5409,ARGUMENT.,"“O Antenor, thou no longer speakest these things grateful to me. Thou"
5410,ARGUMENT.,"knowest how to devise another counsel better than this; but if, in"
5411,ARGUMENT.,"truth, thou speakest this seriously, the gods themselves have now"
5412,ARGUMENT.,deprived thee of thy senses. But I will declare my opinion amidst the
5413,ARGUMENT.,horse-subduing Trojans; I openly declare I will not give up my wife:
5414,ARGUMENT.,"but the treasures, whatever I have brought home from Argos, all these I"
5415,ARGUMENT.,"am willing to give, and even to add others from my own home.”"
5416,ARGUMENT.,
5417,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having spoken, he sat down; but to them arose Priam, son of"
5418,ARGUMENT.,"Dardanus, a counsellor equal to the gods; who thus wisely harangued"
5419,ARGUMENT.,"them, and said:"
5420,ARGUMENT.,
5421,ARGUMENT.,"“Hear me, ye Trojans, and Dardanians, and allies, that I may tell you"
5422,ARGUMENT.,"what the soul in my breast commands. Now take repast through the army,"
5423,ARGUMENT.,"as heretofore, and be attentive to the watch, and let each be mindful"
5424,ARGUMENT.,"of guard. But in the morning let Idæus proceed to the hollow ships, to"
5425,ARGUMENT.,"announce to the sons of Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaus, the resolution"
5426,ARGUMENT.,"of Alexander, on whose account the contention has arisen; and let him"
5427,ARGUMENT.,"add this prudent request also, whether they wish to desist from"
5428,ARGUMENT.,"horrid-sounding war, until we burn the dead; afterwards will we fight"
5429,ARGUMENT.,"again till fate separate us, and give the victory to one or other of"
5430,ARGUMENT.,us.”
5431,ARGUMENT.,
5432,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he said: but they heard him very attentively, and obeyed. Then"
5433,ARGUMENT.,"they took their repast throughout the city, by companies. In the"
5434,ARGUMENT.,"morning Idæus went to the hollow ships. He found the Greeks, the"
5435,ARGUMENT.,"servants of Mars, in council, at the stern of 262 Agamemnon’s ship: and"
5436,ARGUMENT.,"the clear-voiced herald, standing in the midst of them, spoke thus:"
5437,ARGUMENT.,
5438,ARGUMENT.,"“Ye sons of Atreus, and ye other chiefs of all the Greeks, Priam and"
5439,ARGUMENT.,"the other illustrious Trojans command me to tell you, if it be"
5440,ARGUMENT.,"agreeable and pleasing to you, the determination of Alexander, on whose"
5441,ARGUMENT.,account this contention has arisen.”

5444,ARGUMENT.,"See Lesbonax, p. 181, ed. Valck."
5445,ARGUMENT.,
5446,ARGUMENT.,"“Whatever treasures Alexander brought in the hollow ships to Troy,"
5447,ARGUMENT.,"(would that he first had perished,) all these is he willing to give up,"
5448,ARGUMENT.,and even to add others from his own home: but he says that he will not
5449,ARGUMENT.,"restore the wedded spouse of glorious Menelaus: certainly the Trojans,"
5450,ARGUMENT.,"at least, advise him. They also order me to make this proposal, to wit,"
5451,ARGUMENT.,"whether ye are willing to desist from dreadful-sounding war, until we"
5452,ARGUMENT.,"shall burn the dead: afterwards we shall fight again, till fate"
5453,ARGUMENT.,"separate us, and give the victory to one of us.”"
5454,ARGUMENT.,
5455,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he said, but they all became mute in silence. At length Diomede,"
5456,ARGUMENT.,"brave in the din of war, spoke thus amongst them:"
5457,ARGUMENT.,
5458,ARGUMENT.,"“Let none now receive the treasures of Alexander, nor Helen: for it is"
5459,ARGUMENT.,"plain, even [to him] who is a mere infant, that the issues of"
5460,ARGUMENT.,destruction impend over the Trojans.”
5461,ARGUMENT.,
5462,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he said, and all the sons of the Greeks shouted, admiring the"
5463,ARGUMENT.,"words of horse-breaking Diomede: and then Agamemnon, king of men, thus"
5464,ARGUMENT.,addressed Idæus:
5465,ARGUMENT.,
5466,ARGUMENT.,"“Idæus, thou thyself hearest, indeed, the sentiments of the Greeks, how"
5467,ARGUMENT.,"they answer thee; and such also pleases me. But concerning the dead, I"
5468,ARGUMENT.,grudge not that [you] should burn them; for there is no grudge towards
5469,ARGUMENT.,"the dead bodies, when they are dead, hastily to perform their obsequies"
5470,ARGUMENT.,"with fire: 263 but let loud-resounding Jove, the husband of Juno, be"
5471,ARGUMENT.,witness of the treaties.”
5472,ARGUMENT.,
5473,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 263: (return)  Literally, “to appease [the dead].”"
5474,ARGUMENT.,
5475,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having said, he raised his sceptre to all the gods. But Idæus"
5476,ARGUMENT.,returned to sacred Ilium. And the Trojans and Dardanians all sat
5477,ARGUMENT.,"assembled in council, expecting when Idæus might return. He came, and"
5478,ARGUMENT.,"declared his message, standing in the midst of them. But they prepared"
5479,ARGUMENT.,"themselves very speedily for both purposes, some to carry away the"
5480,ARGUMENT.,"bodies, and others to gather wood. The Greeks also on the other side"
5481,ARGUMENT.,"hastened from their well-benched ships, some to carry away the bodies,"
5482,ARGUMENT.,and others to collect wood.
5483,ARGUMENT.,
5484,ARGUMENT.,"Then, indeed, the sun freshly struck the fields [with its rays],"
5485,ARGUMENT.,"ascending heaven from the calmly-flowing, deep-moving ocean. But they"
5486,ARGUMENT.,met one another. Then was it difficult to distinguish each man [amongst
5487,ARGUMENT.,"the slain]; but washing off with water the bloody gore, and pouring"
5488,ARGUMENT.,"over them warm tears, they placed them upon the chariots; nor did"
5489,ARGUMENT.,"mighty Priam suffer them to give way to grief. In silence, therefore,"
5490,ARGUMENT.,"they heaped the bodies on the pile, grieving at heart. But when they"
5491,ARGUMENT.,"had burned them in the fire, they returned to sacred Ilium. In like"
5492,ARGUMENT.,"manner also, on the other side, the well-greaved Greeks heaped the"
5493,ARGUMENT.,"bodies on the pile, grieving in their heart; and having burned them"
5494,ARGUMENT.,"with fire, they returned to the hollow ships. And when it was not yet"
5495,ARGUMENT.,"morning, but still twilight, then a chosen band of Greeks arose about"
5496,ARGUMENT.,"the pile; and going out from the plain, they made around it one common"
5497,ARGUMENT.,"tomb, and near it they built a wall and lofty towers, a bulwark of"
5498,ARGUMENT.,"their ships and of themselves. In them they made well-fitted gates,"
5499,ARGUMENT.,that through them there might be a passage for the chariots. Without
5500,ARGUMENT.,"they dug a deep ditch, near it, broad and large, and in it fixed"
5501,ARGUMENT.,palisades. Thus the long-haired Greeks on their part laboured.
5502,ARGUMENT.,
5503,ARGUMENT.,"But the gods on the contrary sitting beside the thundering Jove, were"
5504,ARGUMENT.,admiring the mighty work of the brazen-mailed Greeks; but to them
5505,ARGUMENT.,"Neptune, the earth-shaker, thus began to speak:"
5506,ARGUMENT.,
5507,ARGUMENT.,"“O father Jove, is there any mortal on the boundless earth, who will"
5508,ARGUMENT.,any more disclose his mind and counsel to the immortals? Dost thou not
5509,ARGUMENT.,perceive how the long-haired Greeks have built a wall before their
5510,ARGUMENT.,"shipping, and have drawn a ditch all round, nor have they given"
5511,ARGUMENT.,splendid hecatombs to the gods? The fame of this [work] will certainly
5512,ARGUMENT.,be wherever light is diffused: but they will forget that [wall] which I
5513,ARGUMENT.,"and Phœbus Apollo, toiling, built round the city for the hero"
5514,ARGUMENT.,Laomedon.” 264
5515,ARGUMENT.,
5516,ARGUMENT.,"Him, greatly enraged, the cloud-compelling Jove addressed:"
5517,ARGUMENT.,
5518,ARGUMENT.,"“Ha! thou far-ruling earth-shaker, what hast thou said? Another of the"
5519,ARGUMENT.,"gods, who is much weaker than thou in hands and in might might have"
5520,ARGUMENT.,dreaded this idea; but thy glory shall assuredly extend as far as light
5521,ARGUMENT.,"is diffused. Howbeit, when the crest-waving Greeks shall have departed"
5522,ARGUMENT.,"with their ships into their dear fatherland, do thou, overthrowing this"
5523,ARGUMENT.,"wall, sink it all in the deep, and again cover the great shore with"
5524,ARGUMENT.,sand. Thus may this mighty rampart of the Greeks be wholly effaced.”
5525,ARGUMENT.,
5526,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 264: (return)  Grote, Hist. p. 78, well observes that the"
5527,ARGUMENT.,“subsequent animosity of Neptune against Troy was greatly determined by
5528,ARGUMENT.,the sentiment of the injustice of Laomedon.” On the discrepancy between
5529,ARGUMENT.,"this passage and XXI. 442, see Müller, Dor. vol. i. p. 249"
5530,ARGUMENT.,
5531,ARGUMENT.,Thus were they conversing on such matters among themselves. But the sun
5532,ARGUMENT.,"had set, and the work of the Greeks was finished. They slaughtered oxen"
5533,ARGUMENT.,"through the tents, and took their repast. Many ships (which Euneüs, son"
5534,ARGUMENT.,"of Jason, whom Hypsipyle bore to Jason, shepherd of the people, sent,)"
5535,ARGUMENT.,"arrived from Lemnos, bringing wine. The son of Jason gave of wine a"
5536,ARGUMENT.,"thousand measures, to be brought separately, as a gift to the sons of"
5537,ARGUMENT.,"Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaus. Thence the long-haired Greeks bought"
5538,ARGUMENT.,"265 wine, some for brass, some for shining iron, others for hides, some"
5539,ARGUMENT.,"for the oxen themselves, and some for slaves; and they prepared an"
5540,ARGUMENT.,"abundant feast. Through the whole night, indeed, the long-haired Greeks"
5541,ARGUMENT.,"feasted; and the Trojans too, and their allies, through the city. And"
5542,ARGUMENT.,"all night thundering fearfully, provident Jove was devising evils for"
5543,ARGUMENT.,both parties; but pale fear seized them. And they poured wine from
5544,ARGUMENT.,"their cups on the earth, nor did any one dare to drink before he had"
5545,ARGUMENT.,"made a libation to the supreme son of Saturn. They then lay down, and"
5546,ARGUMENT.,enjoyed the boon of sleep.

5613,ARGUMENT.,
5614,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he said. But they all became mute in silence, wondering at his"
5615,ARGUMENT.,speech; for he spoke very menacingly. But at length the azure-eyed
5616,ARGUMENT.,goddess Minerva thus spoke in the midst:
5617,ARGUMENT.,
5618,ARGUMENT.,“O sire of ours! son of Saturn! most supreme of kings! well do we all
5619,ARGUMENT.,know that thy strength is irresistible: yet do we truly mourn for the
5620,ARGUMENT.,"warlike Greeks, who are now perishing, fulfilling their evil fate. But"
5621,ARGUMENT.,"nevertheless, we will refrain from war, since thus thou commandest. Yet"
5622,ARGUMENT.,"will we suggest counsel to the Greeks, which will avail them, that they"
5623,ARGUMENT.,may not all perish because thou art wrathful.”
5624,ARGUMENT.,
5625,ARGUMENT.,"But her the cloud-impelling Jove smiling addressed: “Be of good cheer,"
5626,ARGUMENT.,"Tritonia, my dear daughter—I speak not with a serious intent; but I am"
5627,ARGUMENT.,willing to be lenient towards thee.”
5628,ARGUMENT.,
5629,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having said, under his chariot he yoked his brazen-footed,"
5630,ARGUMENT.,"swift-flying steeds, adorned with golden manes. He himself put on gold"
5631,ARGUMENT.,"about his person, and took his golden well-made whip, and ascended the"
5632,ARGUMENT.,"chariot; and lashed them on to proceed, and they, not unwilling, flew"
5633,ARGUMENT.,"midway between the earth and starry heaven. He came to spring-fed Ida,"
5634,ARGUMENT.,"the mother of wild beasts, to Gargarus, where he had a consecrated"
5635,ARGUMENT.,"enclosure, and a fragrant altar. There the father of gods and men"
5636,ARGUMENT.,"stopped his steeds, having loosed them from the chariot, and poured a"
5637,ARGUMENT.,"thick haze around. But he sat upon the summits, exulting in glory,"
5638,ARGUMENT.,looking upon the city of the Trojans and the ships of the Greeks.
5639,ARGUMENT.,
5640,ARGUMENT.,Meanwhile the long-haired Greeks were taking their repast in a hurried
5641,ARGUMENT.,"manner through the tents, and after that they put on their armour. But"
5642,ARGUMENT.,"the Trojans, on the other side, were arming themselves through the"
5643,ARGUMENT.,"city, fewer in number; yet even thus, they were eager to fight in"
5644,ARGUMENT.,"battle, compelled by necessity, in defence of their children and their"
5645,ARGUMENT.,"wives. And the gates were opened wide, and the forces rushed out, both"
5646,ARGUMENT.,"chariot warriors and foot, and much tumult arose. But when these"
5647,ARGUMENT.,"collecting together came into one place, they clashed together shields"
5648,ARGUMENT.,"and spears, and the might of brazen-mailed men; but the bossy shields"
5649,ARGUMENT.,"approached one another, and much tumult arose. There at the same time"
5650,ARGUMENT.,"were both lamentation and boasting of men destroying and destroyed, and"
5651,ARGUMENT.,"the earth flowed with blood. As long as the forenoon lasted, and the"
5652,ARGUMENT.,"sacred day was in progress, so long did the weapons touch both, and the"
5653,ARGUMENT.,"people fell. But when the sun had ascended the middle heaven, then at"
5654,ARGUMENT.,"length did Father Jove raise the golden scales, and placed in them two"
5655,ARGUMENT.,"destinies of long-reposing death, [the destinies] both of the"
5656,ARGUMENT.,"horse-breaking Trojans and of the brazen-mailed Greeks, and holding"
5657,ARGUMENT.,"them in the middle, he poised them; but the fatal day of the Greeks"
5658,ARGUMENT.,"inclined low. The destinies of the Greeks, indeed, rested on the"
5659,ARGUMENT.,"bounteous earth, but those of the Trojans on the contrary were elevated"
5660,ARGUMENT.,to the wide heaven.
5661,ARGUMENT.,
5662,ARGUMENT.,"But he himself mightily thundered from Ida, and sent his burning"
5663,ARGUMENT.,"lightning against the army of the Greeks: they having seen it, were"
5664,ARGUMENT.,"amazed, and pale fear seized them all. Then neither Idomeneus, nor"
5665,ARGUMENT.,"Agamemnon, nor the two Ajaces, the servants of Mars, dared to remain."
5666,ARGUMENT.,"Gerenian Nestor alone, the guardian of the Greeks, remained, not"
5667,ARGUMENT.,"willingly, but one of his horses was disabled, which noble Alexander,"
5668,ARGUMENT.,"husband of fair-haired Helen, had pierced with an arrow in the top of"
5669,ARGUMENT.,"the forehead, where the forelocks of horses grow out of the head, and"
5670,ARGUMENT.,"is most fatal. 269 In torture he reared, for the arrow had entered the"
5671,ARGUMENT.,"brain; and he disordered the [other] horses, writhing round the brazen"
5672,ARGUMENT.,"barb. Whilst the old man hastening, was cutting away the side reins of"
5673,ARGUMENT.,"the horse with his sword, then were the swift steeds of Hector coming"
5674,ARGUMENT.,"through the crowd, bearing the bold charioteer Hector. And then the old"
5675,ARGUMENT.,"man would certainly have lost his life, if Diomede, brave in the din of"
5676,ARGUMENT.,"battle, had not quickly observed it; and he shouted, dreadfully"

5689,ARGUMENT.,"though being alone, was mixed with the van, and stood before the steeds"
5690,ARGUMENT.,"of the aged son of Neleus, and addressing him, spoke winged words:"
5691,ARGUMENT.,
5692,ARGUMENT.,"“O old man, certainly the youthful warriors greatly oppress thee: but"
5693,ARGUMENT.,"thy strength is relaxed, and tiresome old age attends thee: thy servant"
5694,ARGUMENT.,"is exhausted, and thy steeds are slow. But come, ascend my chariot,"
5695,ARGUMENT.,"that thou mayest see what kind are the steeds of Tros, skilled to fly"
5696,ARGUMENT.,"and to pursue very rapidly, here and there, through the plain; which"
5697,ARGUMENT.,"lately I took from Æneas, authors of flight. Let the attendants take"
5698,ARGUMENT.,"care of those steeds [of thine], but let us direct these against the"
5699,ARGUMENT.,"horse-breaking Trojans, that even Hector may know whether my spear also"
5700,ARGUMENT.,rages madly in my hands.” Thus he said: but the Gerenian knight Nestor
5701,ARGUMENT.,"disobeyed him not. Accordingly, at once their attendants, brave"
5702,ARGUMENT.,"Sthenelus and valorous Eurymedon, took care of Nestor’s steeds: and the"
5703,ARGUMENT.,two chiefs ascended the chariot of Diomede. Nestor took the shining
5704,ARGUMENT.,"reins in his hands, and lashed the steeds, and soon they came near"
5705,ARGUMENT.,"Hector. At him rushing impetuously forward, the son of Tydeus launched"
5706,ARGUMENT.,"a spear; but the weapon missed him, and struck his attendant charioteer"
5707,ARGUMENT.,"in the breast, near the pap, who was holding the reins of the steeds,"
5708,ARGUMENT.,"Eniopeus, the son of magnanimous Thebæus: but he fell from the chariot,"
5709,ARGUMENT.,"and the swift steeds started back, and there his soul and his strength"
5710,ARGUMENT.,"were dissolved. But excessive grief overshadowed Hector in his mind, on"
5711,ARGUMENT.,"account of [the loss of] his charioteer. There, though grieving for his"
5712,ARGUMENT.,"companion, he let him lie, and sought a bold charioteer: nor did his"
5713,ARGUMENT.,"steeds long want a guide; for soon he found courageous Archeptolemus,"
5714,ARGUMENT.,"the son of Iphitus, whom then he made to mount the swift-footed steeds,"
5715,ARGUMENT.,and gave the reins into his hands.
5716,ARGUMENT.,
5717,ARGUMENT.,"Then, indeed, had slaughter arisen, and dreadful deeds had been done,"
5718,ARGUMENT.,"and [the Trojans] had been pent up in Ilium like lambs, had not the"
5719,ARGUMENT.,"father of both men and gods quickly perceived it. Therefore, dreadfully"
5720,ARGUMENT.,"thundering he sent forth his glowing thunderbolt, and cast it into the"
5721,ARGUMENT.,earth before the steeds of Diomede: but there arose a terrible flame of
5722,ARGUMENT.,"burning sulphur, and the two frightened steeds crouched trembling"
5723,ARGUMENT.,"beneath the chariot. Moreover, the beautiful reins fell from the hands"
5724,ARGUMENT.,"of Nestor, and he feared in his soul, and addressed Diomede:"
5725,ARGUMENT.,
5726,ARGUMENT.,"“Son of Tydeus, come now, turn thy solid-hoofed steeds to flight. Dost"
5727,ARGUMENT.,"thou not perceive that victory from Jove does not attend thee? For now,"
5728,ARGUMENT.,"this very day, of a truth, Saturnian Jove awards him glory; afterwards"
5729,ARGUMENT.,"again will he give it to us, if he shall be willing. By no means can a"
5730,ARGUMENT.,"man impede the will of Jove, not even a very mighty one; since he is by"
5731,ARGUMENT.,far the most powerful.”
5732,ARGUMENT.,
5733,ARGUMENT.,"But him Diomede, brave in the din of war, then answered: “Old man,"
5734,ARGUMENT.,certainly thou hast said all this rightly: but this grievous sorrow
5735,ARGUMENT.,"invades my heart and my soul: for Hector at some time will say,"
5736,ARGUMENT.,"haranguing amongst the Trojans, ‘The son of Tydeus, routed by me, fled"
5737,ARGUMENT.,to his ships.’ Thus at some time will he boast: but then may the earth
5738,ARGUMENT.,yawn wide for me.”
5739,ARGUMENT.,
5740,ARGUMENT.,But him the Gerenian knight Nestor then answered: “Alas! warlike son of
5741,ARGUMENT.,"Tydeus, what hast thou said? Even though Hector call thee coward and"
5742,ARGUMENT.,"unwarlike, yet the Trojans and Dardanians, and the wives of the"
5743,ARGUMENT.,"stout-hearted shield-bearing Trojans, whose vigorous husbands thou hast"
5744,ARGUMENT.,"prostrated in the dust, will not believe him.”"
5745,ARGUMENT.,
5746,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having said, he turned the solid-hoofed steeds to flight, back"
5747,ARGUMENT.,"into the crowd. But the Trojans and Hector, with a mighty shout, poured"
5748,ARGUMENT.,destructive missiles upon them. And then after him loud roared mighty
5749,ARGUMENT.,crest-tossing Hector:
5750,ARGUMENT.,
5751,ARGUMENT.,"“Son of Tydeus, the swift-horsed Greeks honoured thee, indeed, above"
5752,ARGUMENT.,"[others] with a seat, with meat, and full cups; but now will they"
5753,ARGUMENT.,dishonour thee; for thou hast become like a woman. Away! timorous girl!
5754,ARGUMENT.,"since thou shalt never climb our towers, I giving way, nor bear away"
5755,ARGUMENT.,our women in thy ships; first shall I give thee thy doom.”
5756,ARGUMENT.,
5757,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he said; but the son of Tydeus debated whether to turn his steeds,"
5758,ARGUMENT.,"and to fight against him. Thrice, indeed, he thought in mind and soul,"
5759,ARGUMENT.,"but thrice, on the other hand, the provident Jove thundered from the"
5760,ARGUMENT.,"Idæan mountains, giving a signal to the Trojans, the alternating"
5761,ARGUMENT.,"success of battle. But Hector exhorted the Trojans, vociferating aloud:"
5762,ARGUMENT.,
5763,ARGUMENT.,"“Ye Trojans and Lycians, and close-fighting Dardanians, be men, my"
5764,ARGUMENT.,"friends, and be mindful of impetuous might! I know the son of Saturn"
5765,ARGUMENT.,"hath willingly accorded me victory and great renown, but to the Greeks"
5766,ARGUMENT.,"destruction. Fools, who indeed built those weak, worthless walls, which"
5767,ARGUMENT.,shall not check my strength; but our steeds will easily overleap the
5768,ARGUMENT.,"dug trench. But when, indeed, I come to their hollow ships, then let"
5769,ARGUMENT.,"there be some memory of burning fire, that I may consume their fleet"
5770,ARGUMENT.,"with the flame, and slay the Argives themselves at the ships,"
5771,ARGUMENT.,bewildered by the smoke.”
5772,ARGUMENT.,
5773,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having spoken, he cheered on his steeds, and said: “Xanthus, and"
5774,ARGUMENT.,"thou Podargus, and Æthon, and noble Lampus, now repay to me the"
5775,ARGUMENT.,"attention, with which, in great abundance, Andromache, the daughter of"
5776,ARGUMENT.,"magnanimous Eetion, gave to you the sweet barley, mixing wine also [for"
5777,ARGUMENT.,"you] to drink, whenever your mind ordered it, even before me, who boast"
5778,ARGUMENT.,"to be her vigorous husband. But follow and hasten, that we may take the"
5779,ARGUMENT.,"shield of Nestor, the fame of which has now reached the heaven, that it"
5780,ARGUMENT.,"is entirely golden, the handles and itself: but, from the shoulders of"
5781,ARGUMENT.,"horse-breaking Diomede, the well-made corslet, which the artist Vulcan"
5782,ARGUMENT.,"wrought. If we can take these, I expect that the Greeks this very night"
5783,ARGUMENT.,will ascend their swift ships.”
5784,ARGUMENT.,
5785,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he said boasting; but venerable Juno was indignant, and shook"
5786,ARGUMENT.,"herself on her throne, and made great Olympus tremble; and openly"
5787,ARGUMENT.,"accosted the mighty deity, Neptune:"
5788,ARGUMENT.,
5789,ARGUMENT.,"“Alas! far-ruling Earth-shaker, dost thou not in thy soul pity the"
5790,ARGUMENT.,perishing Greeks? But they bring thee many and grateful gifts to Helice
5791,ARGUMENT.,"and Ægæ. Do thou, therefore, will to them the victory. For if we were"
5792,ARGUMENT.,"willing, as many of us as are assistants to the Greeks, to repulse the"
5793,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans and restrain far-sounding Jove, then might he grieve sitting"
5794,ARGUMENT.,alone there on Ida.”
5795,ARGUMENT.,
5796,ARGUMENT.,"But her king Neptune, greatly excited, thus addressed: “Juno, petulant"
5797,ARGUMENT.,"270 in speech, what hast thou said? I would not wish, indeed, that we,"
5798,ARGUMENT.,"the other gods, should fight with Saturnian Jove, since he is by far"
5799,ARGUMENT.,most powerful.”

5804,ARGUMENT.,
5805,ARGUMENT.,Thus indeed were they holding such converse with each other. But
5806,ARGUMENT.,whatever space before the ships the trench belonging to the tower
5807,ARGUMENT.,"enclosed, was filled with horses and shielded men crowded together. 271"
5808,ARGUMENT.,"But Hector, the son of Priam, equal to swift Mars, had crowded them"
5809,ARGUMENT.,"thus, when Jupiter awarded him glory. And now would he have burned the"
5810,ARGUMENT.,"equal ships with blazing fire, had not venerable Juno put it into the"
5811,ARGUMENT.,"soul of Agamemnon, himself actively engaged, briskly to urge on the"
5812,ARGUMENT.,Greeks. He therefore hastened to go along the tents and ships of the
5813,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks, holding in his stout hand his great purple robe. But in the"
5814,ARGUMENT.,"huge black ship of Ulysses he stood, which was in the midst, that he"
5815,ARGUMENT.,"might shout audibly to either side, as well to the tent of Telamonian"
5816,ARGUMENT.,"Ajax, as to that of Achilles, for they had drawn up their equal ships"
5817,ARGUMENT.,"at the extremities of the line, relying on their valour and the"
5818,ARGUMENT.,"strength of their hands. Then he shouted distinctly, calling upon the"
5819,ARGUMENT.,Greeks:
5820,ARGUMENT.,
5821,ARGUMENT.,"“Shame! ye Greeks, foul subjects of disgrace! gallant in form [alone]!"
5822,ARGUMENT.,"Where are those boastings gone, when we professed ourselves the"
5823,ARGUMENT.,"bravest; those which, once in Lemnos, vain braggarts! ye did utter,"
5824,ARGUMENT.,"eating much flesh of horned oxen, and drinking-goblets crowned with"
5825,ARGUMENT.,"wine, 272 that each would in battle be equivalent to a hundred and even"
5826,ARGUMENT.,"two hundred of the Trojans? But now, indeed, we are not equal to Hector"
5827,ARGUMENT.,"alone, who shortly will burn our ships with flaming fire. Ο father"
5828,ARGUMENT.,"Jove, hast thou indeed ever yet afflicted with such destruction any one"
5829,ARGUMENT.,"of mighty kings, and so deprived him of high renown? And yet I say that"
5830,ARGUMENT.,"I never passed by thy fair altar in my many-benched ship, coming here"
5831,ARGUMENT.,"with ill luck. 273 But on all I burned the fat of oxen and the thighs,"
5832,ARGUMENT.,"desiring to sack well-walled Troy. But, Ο Jove, accomplish for me this"
5833,ARGUMENT.,"vow, at least permit us to escape and get away; nor suffer the Greeks"
5834,ARGUMENT.,to be thus subdued by the Trojans.”

5851,ARGUMENT.,offspring of a swift deer: and near the very beauteous altar of Jove he
5852,ARGUMENT.,"cast down the fawn, where the Greeks were sacrificing to Panomphæan 276"

5854,ARGUMENT.,
5855,ARGUMENT.,"When, therefore, they saw that the bird had come from Jove, they rushed"

5857,ARGUMENT.,"the Greeks, numerous as they were, could have boasted that he had"
5858,ARGUMENT.,"driven his swift steeds before Diomede, and urged them beyond the"
5859,ARGUMENT.,"ditch, and fought against [the enemy]; for far the first he slew a"
5860,ARGUMENT.,"helmeted Trojan hero, Agelaus, son of Phradmon. He, indeed, was turning"
5861,ARGUMENT.,"his horses for flight; but as he was turning, Diomede fixed his spear"
5862,ARGUMENT.,"in his back, between his shoulders, and drove it through his breast. He"
5863,ARGUMENT.,"fell from his chariot, and his arms rattled upon him. After him the"
5864,ARGUMENT.,"sons of Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaus; after them the Ajaces, clad in"
5865,ARGUMENT.,"impetuous valour; after them, Idomeneus and Meriones, the armour-bearer"
5866,ARGUMENT.,"of Idomeneus, equal to man-slaughtering Mars; and after them Eurypylus,"
5867,ARGUMENT.,"the illustrious son of Evæmon. Teucer came the ninth, stretching his"
5868,ARGUMENT.,"bent 277 bow, and stood under the shield of Telamonian Ajax. Then Ajax,"
5869,ARGUMENT.,"indeed, kept moving the shield aside, and the hero looking around, when"
5870,ARGUMENT.,"shooting, he had hit any one in the crowd, the one 278 falling there,"
5871,ARGUMENT.,"lost his life. But he 279 retiring like a child to his mother,"
5872,ARGUMENT.,"sheltered himself beneath Ajax, and he covered him with his splendid"
5873,ARGUMENT.,shield. Then what Trojan first did blameless Teucer slay? Orsilochus
5874,ARGUMENT.,"first, and Ormenus, and Ophelestes, and Dætor, and Chromius, and"
5875,ARGUMENT.,"godlike Lycophontes, and Amopaon, son of Polyæmon, and Melanippus—all,"
5876,ARGUMENT.,"one after the other, he stretched upon the bounteous earth. But"
5877,ARGUMENT.,"Agamemnon, king of men, rejoiced at seeing him destroying the phalanxes"
5878,ARGUMENT.,"of the Trojans with his stout bow. And advancing near him he stood, and"

5913,ARGUMENT.,"strength, do I loiter: but from the time we have driven the Trojans"
5914,ARGUMENT.,"towards Ilium, since that period have I slain men, intercepting them"
5915,ARGUMENT.,"with my shafts. Already have I discharged eight long-bearded arrows,"
5916,ARGUMENT.,and they have all been fixed in the bodies of warlike youths; but I
5917,ARGUMENT.,cannot strike this raging dog.”
5918,ARGUMENT.,
5919,ARGUMENT.,He said; and another arrow from the string he shot right against
5920,ARGUMENT.,"Hector, for his mind was eager to strike him; and him indeed he missed:"
5921,ARGUMENT.,"but in the breast he struck blameless Gorgythion with an arrow, the"
5922,ARGUMENT.,"brave son of Priam. Him his fair mother Castianira, like unto a goddess"
5923,ARGUMENT.,"in person, brought forth, being wedded from Æsyma. And as a poppy,"
5924,ARGUMENT.,"which in the garden is weighed down with fruit and vernal showers,"
5925,ARGUMENT.,"droops its head to one side, so did his head incline aside, depressed"
5926,ARGUMENT.,by the helmet. But Teucer discharged another arrow from the string
5927,ARGUMENT.,"against Hector, for his mind longed to strike him. Yet even then he"
5928,ARGUMENT.,"missed, for Apollo warded off the shaft: but he struck in the breast,"
5929,ARGUMENT.,"near the pap, Archeptolemus, the bold charioteer of Hector, rushing to"
5930,ARGUMENT.,"battle: and he fell from his chariot, and his swift steeds sprang back."
5931,ARGUMENT.,There his soul and strength were dissolved. But sad grief darkened the
5932,ARGUMENT.,"mind of Hector, on account of his charioteer. Then indeed he left him,"
5933,ARGUMENT.,"although grieved for his companion, and ordered his brother Cebriones,"
5934,ARGUMENT.,"being near, to take the reins of the steeds; but he was not"
5935,ARGUMENT.,"disobedient, having heard him. Then [Hector] himself leaped from his"
5936,ARGUMENT.,"all-shining chariot to the ground, roaring dreadfully: and he seized a"
5937,ARGUMENT.,"large stone in his hand, and went straight against Teucer, for his mind"
5938,ARGUMENT.,encouraged him to strike him. He on his part took out a bitter arrow
5939,ARGUMENT.,"from his quiver, and applied it to the string: but him, on the other"
5940,ARGUMENT.,"hand, near the shoulder, where the collar-bone separates the neck and"
5941,ARGUMENT.,"breast, and it is a particularly fatal spot, there, as he was drawing"
5942,ARGUMENT.,"back [the bow], the active warrior Hector 281 with a rugged stone"
5943,ARGUMENT.,"struck him earnestly rushing against him. He broke his bowstring, and"
5944,ARGUMENT.,"his hand was numbed at the wrist-joint. Falling on his knees he stood,"
5945,ARGUMENT.,and the bow dropped from his hands. But Ajax did not neglect his fallen
5946,ARGUMENT.,"brother; for running up, he protected him, and stretched his shield"
5947,ARGUMENT.,"before him. Afterwards his two dear companions, Mecistheus, son of"
5948,ARGUMENT.,"Echius, and noble Alastor, coming up, carried him, groaning heavily, to"
5949,ARGUMENT.,the hollow ships.

5952,ARGUMENT.,
5953,ARGUMENT.,But again did Olympian Jove rouse the strength of the Trojans; and they
5954,ARGUMENT.,drove back the Greeks straight to the deep foss. But Hector went in the
5955,ARGUMENT.,"van, looking grim through ferocity; as when some dog, relying on his"
5956,ARGUMENT.,"swift feet, seizes from the rear a wild boar or lion on the haunch and"
5957,ARGUMENT.,"buttocks, and marks him as he turns: so Hector hung on the rear of the"
5958,ARGUMENT.,"long-haired Greeks, always slaying the hindmost: and they fled. But"
5959,ARGUMENT.,"when they flying had passed through the stakes and the foss, and many"
5960,ARGUMENT.,"were subdued beneath the hands of the Trojans, they, on the one hand,"
5961,ARGUMENT.,"remaining at the ships were restrained, and having exhorted one"
5962,ARGUMENT.,"another, and raised their hands to all the gods, they prayed each with"
5963,ARGUMENT.,"a loud voice. But, on the other hand, Hector, having the eyes of a"
5964,ARGUMENT.,"Gorgon, or of man-slaughtering Mars, drove round his beauteous-maned"
5965,ARGUMENT.,steeds in all directions.
5966,ARGUMENT.,
5967,ARGUMENT.,"But them [the Greeks] white-armed goddess Juno having beheld, pitied"

5975,ARGUMENT.,
5976,ARGUMENT.,But her the azure-eyed goddess Minerva in turn addressed: “And beyond
5977,ARGUMENT.,"doubt this warrior would have lost his vigour and his life, destroyed"
5978,ARGUMENT.,"by the hands of the Greeks in his fatherland, were it not that this my"
5979,ARGUMENT.,"sire rages with no sound mind; cruel, ever unjust, a counteractor of my"
5980,ARGUMENT.,"efforts. Nor does he remember aught of my services, that I have very"
5981,ARGUMENT.,"often preserved his son, when oppressed by the labours of Eurystheus."
5982,ARGUMENT.,He truly wept to heaven; but me Jove sent down from heaven to aid him.

5992,ARGUMENT.,"the son of Priam, will rejoice at us, as I appear in the walks 283 of"
5993,ARGUMENT.,war. Certainly also some one of the Trojans will satiate the dogs and

6009,ARGUMENT.,"own hands. But she, having put on the coat of mail of cloud-compelling"
6010,ARGUMENT.,"Jove, was equipped in armour for the tearful war. She mounted her"
6011,ARGUMENT.,"flaming chariot on her feet, and took her heavy, huge, sturdy spear,"
6012,ARGUMENT.,"with which she is wont to subdue the ranks of heroic men, with"
6013,ARGUMENT.,"whomsoever she, sprung from a powerful sire, is enraged. But Juno with"

6023,ARGUMENT.,"But father Jove, when he beheld them from Ida, was grievously enraged,"
6024,ARGUMENT.,and roused golden-winged Iris to bear this message:
6025,ARGUMENT.,
6026,ARGUMENT.,"“Away, depart, swift Iris, turn them back, nor suffer them to come"
6027,ARGUMENT.,against me; for we shall not advantageously engage in battle. For thus
6028,ARGUMENT.,"I speak, and it shall moreover be accomplished, I will lame their swift"
6029,ARGUMENT.,"steeds under their chariot, dislodge them from the chariot, and break"
6030,ARGUMENT.,the chariot; nor for ten revolving years shall ye be healed of the
6031,ARGUMENT.,wounds which the thunderbolt shall inflict: that Minerva may know when
6032,ARGUMENT.,she may be fighting with her sire. But with Juno I am neither so
6033,ARGUMENT.,"indignant nor so angry; for she is ever accustomed to counteract me, in"
6034,ARGUMENT.,whatever I intend.”
6035,ARGUMENT.,
6036,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he said: but Iris, swift as the storm, hastened to bear the"
6037,ARGUMENT.,message. Down from the Idæan mountains she went to great Olympus:
6038,ARGUMENT.,"meeting them in the foremost gates of many-valleyed Olympus, she"
6039,ARGUMENT.,"restrained them, and pronounced to them the message of Jove:"
6040,ARGUMENT.,
6041,ARGUMENT.,“Where do ye go? Why does your soul rage in your breasts? The sun of
6042,ARGUMENT.,Saturn does not suffer you to aid the Greeks. For thus has the son of
6043,ARGUMENT.,"Saturn threatened, and he will assuredly perform it, to lame your swift"
6044,ARGUMENT.,"steeds under your chariot, and dislodge yourselves from the chariot,"
6045,ARGUMENT.,and break the chariot; nor for ten revolving years shall ye be healed
6046,ARGUMENT.,"of the wounds which his thunderbolt shall inflict: that thou, Ο"
6047,ARGUMENT.,"Azure-eyed, mayest know when thou art fighting with thy sire. But with"
6048,ARGUMENT.,Juno he is neither so indignant nor so angry; for she is always
6049,ARGUMENT.,"accustomed to counteract him in whatever he devises. But thou, most"
6050,ARGUMENT.,insolent and audacious hound! if thou in reality shalt dare to raise
6051,ARGUMENT.,thy mighty spear against Jove—” 285
6052,ARGUMENT.,
6053,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 285: (return)  Observe the aposiopesis.
6054,ARGUMENT.,
6055,ARGUMENT.,"Thus indeed having said, swift-footed Iris departed. Then Juno"
6056,ARGUMENT.,addressed these words to Minerva:
6057,ARGUMENT.,
6058,ARGUMENT.,"“Alas! daughter of ægis-bearing Jove, I cannot any longer suffer that"
6059,ARGUMENT.,"we ourselves shall fight against Jove, on account of mortals. Of whom"
6060,ARGUMENT.,"let one perish, and let another live, whoever may chance. But let him,"
6061,ARGUMENT.,"meditating his own affairs in his mind, adjudicate to the Trojans and"
6062,ARGUMENT.,the Greeks as is fair.”
6063,ARGUMENT.,
6064,ARGUMENT.,"Thus then having said, she turned back the solid-hoofed steeds. The"
6065,ARGUMENT.,"Hours unyoked for them the fair-maned steeds, and bound them to the"
6066,ARGUMENT.,ambrosial mangers; but they tilted the chariots against the splendid
6067,ARGUMENT.,"walls. But they themselves sat, mingled with the other deities, on"
6068,ARGUMENT.,"their golden couches, sad at heart."
6069,ARGUMENT.,
6070,ARGUMENT.,Then father Jove drove his beauteous-wheeled chariot and steeds from
6071,ARGUMENT.,"Ida to Olympus, and came to the seats of the gods. His horses, indeed,"
6072,ARGUMENT.,"the illustrious Earth-shaker loosed, but he laid the chariot on its"
6073,ARGUMENT.,"support, spreading a linen coverlet [over it]. But loud-sounding Jove"
6074,ARGUMENT.,"himself sat on his golden throne, and mighty Olympus was shaken under"
6075,ARGUMENT.,"his feet. But Minerva and Juno by themselves sat apart from Jove, nor"
6076,ARGUMENT.,"did they at all address him, nor question him. But he knew in his mind,"
6077,ARGUMENT.,and said:
6078,ARGUMENT.,
6079,ARGUMENT.,"“Why are ye so sad, Minerva and Juno? Indeed, ye have not laboured long"
6080,ARGUMENT.,"in glorious battle to destroy the Trojans, against whom ye have taken"
6081,ARGUMENT.,grievous hatred. Not all the gods in Olympus could altogether turn me
6082,ARGUMENT.,"to flight, such are my strength and my invincible hands. But trembling"
6083,ARGUMENT.,"seized the shining limbs of both of you, before ye saw battle, and the"
6084,ARGUMENT.,"destructive deeds of war. For so I tell you, which would also have been"
6085,ARGUMENT.,"performed: no more should ye, stricken with my thunder, have returned"
6086,ARGUMENT.,"in your chariots to Olympus, where are the seats of the immortals.”"
6087,ARGUMENT.,
6088,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he said: but Minerva and Juno murmured. They sat near each other,"
6089,ARGUMENT.,and were devising evils for the Trojans.
6090,ARGUMENT.,
6091,ARGUMENT.,"Minerva, indeed, was silent, nor said anything, angry with father Jove,"
6092,ARGUMENT.,for wild rage possessed her. But Juno contained not her wrath in her
6093,ARGUMENT.,"breast, but addressed him:"
6094,ARGUMENT.,
6095,ARGUMENT.,"“Most terrible son of Saturn, what hast thou said? Well do we know that"
6096,ARGUMENT.,"thy might is invincible: yet do we lament the warlike Greeks, who will"
6097,ARGUMENT.,"now perish, fulfilling their evil destiny. But nevertheless, we will"
6098,ARGUMENT.,"desist from war, if thou desirest it. But we will suggest counsel to"
6099,ARGUMENT.,"the Greeks, which will avail them, that they may not all perish, thou"
6100,ARGUMENT.,being wrathful.”
6101,ARGUMENT.,
6102,ARGUMENT.,"But her cloud-compelling Jove answering, addressed: “To-morrow, if thou"
6103,ARGUMENT.,"wilt, O venerable, large-eyed Juno, thou shalt behold the very powerful"
6104,ARGUMENT.,son of Saturn even with greater havoc destroying the mighty army of the
6105,ARGUMENT.,warlike Greeks. For warlike Hector will not cease from battle before
6106,ARGUMENT.,that he arouse the swift-footed son of Peleus at the ships. On that
6107,ARGUMENT.,"day, when they indeed are fighting at the ships, in a very narrow pass,"
6108,ARGUMENT.,for Patroclus fallen. For thus is it fated. But I do not make account
6109,ARGUMENT.,"of thee enraged, not if thou shouldst go to the furthest limits of land"
6110,ARGUMENT.,"and ocean, where Iapetus and Saturn sitting, are delighted neither with"
6111,ARGUMENT.,"the splendour of the sun that journeys on high, nor with the winds; but"
6112,ARGUMENT.,"profound Tartarus [is] all around—not even if wandering, thou shouldst"
6113,ARGUMENT.,"go there, have I regard for thee enraged, since there is nothing more"
6114,ARGUMENT.,impudent than thou.”
6115,ARGUMENT.,
6116,ARGUMENT.,Thus he said: but white-armed Juno answered nought. And the bright
6117,ARGUMENT.,"light of the sun fell into the ocean, drawing dark night over the"
6118,ARGUMENT.,fruitful earth. 286 The light set to the Trojans indeed unwilling; but
6119,ARGUMENT.,"gloomy and much-desired light came on, grateful to the Greeks."

6124,ARGUMENT.,
6125,ARGUMENT.,"But illustrious Hector then formed a council of the Trojans, having led"
6126,ARGUMENT.,"them apart from the ships, at the eddying river, in a clear space,"
6127,ARGUMENT.,where the place appeared free from dead bodies. But alighting to the
6128,ARGUMENT.,"ground from their horses, they listened to the speech which Hector,"
6129,ARGUMENT.,"beloved of Jove, uttered. In his hand he held a spear of eleven cubits:"
6130,ARGUMENT.,"and before him shone the golden point of the spear, and a golden ring"
6131,ARGUMENT.,"surrounded it. Leaning on this, he spoke winged words:"
6132,ARGUMENT.,
6133,ARGUMENT.,"“Hear me, ye Trojans, and Dardanians, and allies: I lately thought that"
6134,ARGUMENT.,"having destroyed the ships and all the Greeks, I should return back to"
6135,ARGUMENT.,"wind-swept Ilium. But darkness has come on first, which has now been"
6136,ARGUMENT.,the chief means of preserving the Greeks and their ships on the shore
6137,ARGUMENT.,"of the sea. But, however, let us now obey dark night, and make ready"
6138,ARGUMENT.,our repasts; and do ye loose from your chariots your beautiful-maned
6139,ARGUMENT.,"steeds, and set fodder before them: and quickly bring from the city"
6140,ARGUMENT.,oxen and fat sheep; bring sweet wine and bread from your homes; and
6141,ARGUMENT.,"besides collect many fagots, that all night till Aurora, mother of"
6142,ARGUMENT.,"dawn, we may kindle many fires, and the splendour may ascend to heaven:"
6143,ARGUMENT.,lest haply in the night the long-haired Greeks attempt to fly over the
6144,ARGUMENT.,broad ridge of the ocean. That they may not at all events without toil
6145,ARGUMENT.,and without harm ascend their ships: but [let us] take care that each
6146,ARGUMENT.,"of them may have to heal a wound 287 at home, being stricken either"
6147,ARGUMENT.,"with an arrow, or with a sharp spear, bounding into his ship; that"
6148,ARGUMENT.,every other too may dread to wage tearful war against the
6149,ARGUMENT.,"horse-breaking Trojans. Let the heralds, dear to Jove, proclaim through"
6150,ARGUMENT.,"the city, that the youths at the age of puberty, and the hoary-templed"
6151,ARGUMENT.,"sages, keep watch around the city, in the god-built turrets; and let"
6152,ARGUMENT.,"the females also, the feebler sex, in their halls each kindle a mighty"
6153,ARGUMENT.,"fire: and let there be some strong guard, lest a secret band enter the"
6154,ARGUMENT.,"city, the people being absent. Thus let it be, magnanimous Trojans, as"
6155,ARGUMENT.,"I say: and let the speech, which is now most salutary, be thus spoken."
6156,ARGUMENT.,"But for that which will be [most expedient] in the morning, I will"
6157,ARGUMENT.,[then] speak amongst the horse-breaking Trojans. Making vows both to
6158,ARGUMENT.,"Jove and to the other gods, I hope to banish hence those dogs borne"
6159,ARGUMENT.,"hither by the fates, whom the fates bear in their black ships. 288 But"
6160,ARGUMENT.,"let us keep watch during the night, and in the morning, at dawn,"
6161,ARGUMENT.,"equipped with arms, let us stir up sharp conflict at the hollow ships."
6162,ARGUMENT.,"I will see whether valiant Diomede, the son of Tydeus, will force me"
6163,ARGUMENT.,"back from the ships to our walls, or whether I shall bear away his"
6164,ARGUMENT.,"bloody spoils, having slain him with my brazen spear. To-morrow shall"
6165,ARGUMENT.,"he make manifest his valour, if he shall withstand my assaulting spear."
6166,ARGUMENT.,But I think that he will lie wounded amongst the first at sunrise
6167,ARGUMENT.,"to-morrow, and many companions around him. Would that I were so"
6168,ARGUMENT.,"certainly immortal, and free from old age all my days, and honoured, as"
6169,ARGUMENT.,"Minerva and Apollo are honoured, as [I am certain] that this day will"
6170,ARGUMENT.,bring evil upon the Greeks.”

6180,ARGUMENT.,"loosed from the yoke their sweating steeds, and bound them with"
6181,ARGUMENT.,"halters, each to his own chariot. Quickly they brought from the city"
6182,ARGUMENT.,"oxen and fat sheep: and they brought sweet wine, and bread from their"
6183,ARGUMENT.,"homes, and also collected many fagots. But the winds raised the savour"
6184,ARGUMENT.,from the plain to heaven.
6185,ARGUMENT.,
6186,ARGUMENT.,"But they, greatly elated, sat all night in the ranks of war, and many"
6187,ARGUMENT.,fires blazed for them. As when in heaven the stars appear very
6188,ARGUMENT.,"conspicuous 289 around the lucid moon, when the æther is wont to be"
6189,ARGUMENT.,"without a breeze, and all the pointed rocks and lofty summits and"
6190,ARGUMENT.,"groves appear, but in heaven the immense æther is disclosed, and all"
6191,ARGUMENT.,"the stars are seen, and the shepherd rejoices in his soul. Thus did"
6192,ARGUMENT.,"many fires of the Trojans kindling them appear before Ilium, between"
6193,ARGUMENT.,the ships and the streams of Xanthus. A thousand fires blazed in the
6194,ARGUMENT.,"plain, and by each sat fifty men, at the light of the blazing fire. But"
6195,ARGUMENT.,"their steeds eating white barley and oats, standing by the chariots,"
6196,ARGUMENT.,awaited beautiful-throned Aurora.

6237,ARGUMENT.,"first. And they sat in council, grieved, and Agamemnon arose, shedding"
6238,ARGUMENT.,"tears, like a black-water fountain, which pours its gloomy stream from"
6239,ARGUMENT.,"a lofty rock. Thus he, deeply sighing, spoke words to the Greeks:"
6240,ARGUMENT.,
6241,ARGUMENT.,"“O friends, leaders and chieftains over the Greeks, Jove, the son of"
6242,ARGUMENT.,"Saturn, has greatly entangled me in a grievous calamity: cruel, who"
6243,ARGUMENT.,"once promised me, and assented, that I should return, having destroyed"
6244,ARGUMENT.,"well-built Ilium. But now has he plotted an evil fraud, and orders me"
6245,ARGUMENT.,"to return inglorious to Argos, after I have lost much people. Thus,"
6246,ARGUMENT.,"doubtless, will it be agreeable to almighty Jove, who has already"
6247,ARGUMENT.,"overthrown the heights of many cities, and will still overthrow them,"
6248,ARGUMENT.,"for his power is greatest. But come, let us all obey as I advise: let"
6249,ARGUMENT.,"us fly with the ships to our dear fatherland, for now we shall not take"
6250,ARGUMENT.,wide-wayed Troy.”
6251,ARGUMENT.,
6252,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but they were all still in silence, and the sons of the"
6253,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks being sad, kept silent long: at length Diomede, brave in the din"
6254,ARGUMENT.,"of battle, spoke:"
6255,ARGUMENT.,
6256,ARGUMENT.,"“Son of Atreus, thee will I first oppose, speaking inconsiderately, as"
6257,ARGUMENT.,"is lawful, in the assembly; but be not thou the least offended. First"
6258,ARGUMENT.,"among the Greeks didst thou disparage my valour, saying that I was"
6259,ARGUMENT.,"unwarlike and weak; 292 and all this, as well the young as the old of"
6260,ARGUMENT.,the Greeks know. One of two things hath the son of crafty Saturn given
6261,ARGUMENT.,thee: he has granted that thou shouldst be honoured by the sceptre
6262,ARGUMENT.,"above all; but valour hath he not given thee, which is the greatest"
6263,ARGUMENT.,"strength. Strange man, dost thou then certainly think that the sons of"
6264,ARGUMENT.,"the Greeks are unwarlike and weak, as thou sayest? If indeed thy mind"
6265,ARGUMENT.,"impels thee, that thou shouldst return, go: the way lies open to thee,"
6266,ARGUMENT.,"and thy ships stand near the sea, which very many followed thee from"
6267,ARGUMENT.,Mycenæ. But the other long-haired Greeks will remain until we overthrow
6268,ARGUMENT.,"Troy: but if they also [choose], let them fly with their ships to their"

6280,ARGUMENT.,"up, addressed:"
6281,ARGUMENT.,
6282,ARGUMENT.,"“Son of Tydeus, pre-eminently indeed art thou brave in battle, and the"
6283,ARGUMENT.,best in council amongst all thine equals. No one has censured thy
6284,ARGUMENT.,"discourse, nor contradicts it, as many as are the Greeks; but thou"
6285,ARGUMENT.,"comest not to an end of discussion. 294 Assuredly thou art youthful,"
6286,ARGUMENT.,"and mightst be my youngest son for age, yet thou speakest prudent words"
6287,ARGUMENT.,"to the kings of the Greeks, for thou hast said aright. But come, I who"

6290,ARGUMENT.,"Tribeless, lawless, homeless is he, who loves horrid civil war. But"
6291,ARGUMENT.,"now, however, let us obey dark night, and make ready suppers. But let"
6292,ARGUMENT.,"the respective guards lie down beside the trench, dug without the wall."
6293,ARGUMENT.,"To the youth, indeed, I enjoin these things; but next, Atrides, do thou"
6294,ARGUMENT.,"begin, for thou art supreme. Give a banquet to the elders; it becomes"
6295,ARGUMENT.,"thee, and is not unseemly. Full are thy tents of wine, which the ships"
6296,ARGUMENT.,of the Greeks daily bring over the wide sea from Thrace. Thou hast
6297,ARGUMENT.,"every accommodation, and rulest over many people. But when many are"
6298,ARGUMENT.,"assembled, do thou obey him who shall give the best advice; for there"
6299,ARGUMENT.,"is great need of good and prudent [advice] to all the Greeks, since the"
6300,ARGUMENT.,enemy are burning many fires near the ships; and who can rejoice at
6301,ARGUMENT.,these things? But this night will either ruin the army or preserve it.”
6302,ARGUMENT.,
6303,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 294: (return)  _I. e_. thou hast not said all that might have
6304,ARGUMENT.,been said on the subject.
6305,ARGUMENT.,
6306,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; and they heard him very attentively, and obeyed. But the"
6307,ARGUMENT.,"guards rushed forth with their arms, [those around] Thrasymedes, the"
6308,ARGUMENT.,"son of Nestor, the shepherd of the people, Ascalaphus and Ialmenus,"
6309,ARGUMENT.,"sons of Mars, Meriones, Aphareus, and Deïpyrus, as well as the son of"
6310,ARGUMENT.,"Creon, noble Lycomedes. There were seven leaders of the guards, and a"
6311,ARGUMENT.,"hundred youths marched along with each, holding long spears in their"
6312,ARGUMENT.,"hands. Proceeding to the space between the trench and the wall, there"
6313,ARGUMENT.,"they sat down, and there kindled a fire, and prepared each his supper."
6314,ARGUMENT.,
6315,ARGUMENT.,"But Atrides conducted the assembled elders of the Greeks to his tent,"
6316,ARGUMENT.,and set before them a strength-recruiting banquet; and they laid their
6317,ARGUMENT.,hands upon the viands placed before them. But when they had dismissed
6318,ARGUMENT.,"the desire of eating and drinking, to them first of all did aged"
6319,ARGUMENT.,"Nestor, whose advice had previously appeared best, begin to interweave"
6320,ARGUMENT.,"advice; who wisely counselling, addressed them, and said:"
6321,ARGUMENT.,
6322,ARGUMENT.,"“Most glorious Atrides, king of men, Agamemnon, with thee shall I end,"
6323,ARGUMENT.,"and with thee shall I commence. Since thou art a king of many nations,"
6324,ARGUMENT.,"and Jove hath placed in thine hands both a sceptre and laws, that thou"
6325,ARGUMENT.,mayest consult for their advantage. Therefore is it necessary that thou
6326,ARGUMENT.,"in particular shouldst deliver and hear an opinion, and also accomplish"
6327,ARGUMENT.,"that of another, when his mind urges any one to speak for the [public]"
6328,ARGUMENT.,good; but on thee will depend whatever takes the lead. Yet will I speak
6329,ARGUMENT.,as appears to me to be best. For no other person will propound a better
6330,ARGUMENT.,"opinion than that which I meditate, both of old and also now, from that"
6331,ARGUMENT.,"period when thou, O nobly born, didst depart, carrying off the maid"
6332,ARGUMENT.,Briseïs from the tent of the enraged Achilles; by no means according to
6333,ARGUMENT.,my judgment; for I very strenuously dissuaded thee from it: but having
6334,ARGUMENT.,"yielded to thy haughty temper, thou didst dishonour the bravest hero,"
6335,ARGUMENT.,"whom even the immortals have honoured; for, taking away his reward,"
6336,ARGUMENT.,thou still retainest it. Yet even now let us deliberate how we may
6337,ARGUMENT.,"succeed in persuading him, appeasing him with agreeable gifts and"
6338,ARGUMENT.,soothing words.”
6339,ARGUMENT.,
6340,ARGUMENT.,"But him the king of men, Agamemnon, again addressed: “Old man, thou"
6341,ARGUMENT.,"hast not falsely enumerated my errors. I have erred, nor do I myself"
6342,ARGUMENT.,"deny it. That man indeed is equivalent to many troops, whom Jove loves"
6343,ARGUMENT.,"in his heart, as now he hath honoured this man, and subdued the people"
6344,ARGUMENT.,"of the Greeks. But since I erred, having yielded to my wayward"
6345,ARGUMENT.,"disposition, I desire again to appease him, and to give him invaluable"
6346,ARGUMENT.,presents. Before you all will I enumerate the distinguished gifts:
6347,ARGUMENT.,"seven tripods untouched by fire, 295 and ten talents of gold, and"
6348,ARGUMENT.,"twenty shining caldrons, and twelve stout steeds, victorious in the"
6349,ARGUMENT.,"race, which have borne off prizes by their feet. No pauper would the"
6350,ARGUMENT.,"man be, nor in want of precious gold, to whom as many prizes belong as"
6351,ARGUMENT.,[these] solid-hoofed steeds have brought to me. I will likewise give
6352,ARGUMENT.,"seven beautiful Lesbian women, skilful in faultless works; whom I"
6353,ARGUMENT.,"selected when he himself took well-inhabited Lesbos, who excel the race"
6354,ARGUMENT.,"of women in beauty. These will I give him, and amongst them will be her"
6355,ARGUMENT.,"whom then I took away, the daughter of Briseïs; and I will swear"
6356,ARGUMENT.,"moreover a mighty oath, that I never ascended her bed, nor embraced"
6357,ARGUMENT.,"her, as is the custom of human beings—of men and women. All these shall"
6358,ARGUMENT.,"immediately be ready; and if, moreover, the gods grant that we destroy"
6359,ARGUMENT.,"the great city of Priam, let him fill his ships abundantly with gold"
6360,ARGUMENT.,"and brass, entering in when we the Greeks divide the spoil. Let him"

6367,ARGUMENT.,"choose, without marriage-dower, to the house of Peleus; but I will give"
6368,ARGUMENT.,"very many dowries, so many as no man ever yet gave to his daughter. I"
6369,ARGUMENT.,"will, moreover, give him seven well-inhabited cities,—Cardamyle, Enope,"
6370,ARGUMENT.,"and grassy Ira, glorious Pheræ, with deep-pastured Anthea, fair Æpeia,"
6371,ARGUMENT.,"and vine-bearing Pedasus; which are all near the sea, the last towards"
6372,ARGUMENT.,"sandy Pylus. But in them dwell men rich in flocks and herds, who will"
6373,ARGUMENT.,"honour him like a god with gifts, and beneath his sceptre will pay rich"
6374,ARGUMENT.,"tributes. These will I bestow upon him, ceasing from his anger. Let him"
6375,ARGUMENT.,"be prevailed upon. Pluto indeed is implacable and inexorable, wherefore"
6376,ARGUMENT.,he is the most hateful of all the gods to men. Let him likewise yield

6382,ARGUMENT.,"despicable to king Achilles. But come, let us urge chosen men, who may"
6383,ARGUMENT.,"go with all speed to the tent of Achilles, the son of Peleus. Come"
6384,ARGUMENT.,"then, these will I select, but let them obey. First of all indeed let"
6385,ARGUMENT.,"Phœnix, dear to Jove, be the leader; next then mighty Ajax and divine"
6386,ARGUMENT.,"Ulysses: and of the heralds, let Hodius and Eurybates follow with them."

6409,ARGUMENT.,"had made libations, and drunk as much as their mind desired, they"
6410,ARGUMENT.,"hastened from the tent of Agamemnon, the son of Atreus. To them the"

6415,ARGUMENT.,"They twain then went along the shore of the loud-sounding sea, praying"
6416,ARGUMENT.,"earnestly to earth-shaking [Neptune], who encompasses the earth, that"
6417,ARGUMENT.,they might easily persuade the great mind of the grandson of Æacus. But
6418,ARGUMENT.,"they came to the tents and ships of the Myrmidons, and they found him"
6419,ARGUMENT.,"delighting his soul with his clear-toned harp, beautiful, curiously"
6420,ARGUMENT.,"wrought, and upon it was a silver comb. This he had taken from amongst"
6421,ARGUMENT.,"the spoils, having destroyed the city of Eëtion, and with it he was"
6422,ARGUMENT.,"delighting his soul, and singing the glorious deeds 298 of heroes."
6423,ARGUMENT.,"Patroclus alone sat opposite to him in silence, waiting upon the"
6424,ARGUMENT.,descendant of Æacus when he should cease to sing. Then they advanced
6425,ARGUMENT.,"farther, and divine Ulysses preceded; and they stood before him; whilst"
6426,ARGUMENT.,"Achilles, astonished, leaped up, with his lyre, quitting the seat where"
6427,ARGUMENT.,"he had been sitting. In like manner Patroclus, when he beheld the"
6428,ARGUMENT.,"heroes, arose, and swift-footed Achilles taking them by the hand,"
6429,ARGUMENT.,addressed them:

6431,ARGUMENT.,"“Hail, warriors, ye indeed have come as friends. Surely [there is] some"

6439,ARGUMENT.,upon couches and purple coverlets; then straightway he addressed
6440,ARGUMENT.,"Patroclus, who was near:"
6441,ARGUMENT.,
6442,ARGUMENT.,"“Place a larger goblet, O son of Menœtius, mix purer wine, 299 and"

6448,ARGUMENT.,
6449,ARGUMENT.,Thus he spoke; and Patroclus obeyed his dear companion. But he
6450,ARGUMENT.,"[Achilles] placed in the flame of the fire a large dressing-block, and"
6451,ARGUMENT.,"upon it he laid the chine of a sheep and of a fat goat, with the back"
6452,ARGUMENT.,"of a fatted sow, abounding in fat. Automedon then held them for him,"
6453,ARGUMENT.,and noble Achilles cut them up; and divided them skilfully into small
6454,ARGUMENT.,"pieces, and transfixed them with spits; whilst the son of Menœtius, a"
6455,ARGUMENT.,"godlike hero, kindled a large fire. But when the fire had burned away,"
6456,ARGUMENT.,"and the flame grew languid, strewing the embers, he extended the spits"
6457,ARGUMENT.,"over them, and sprinkled them with sacred salt, raising them up from"
6458,ARGUMENT.,"the racks. But when he had dressed them, and had thrown them upon"
6459,ARGUMENT.,"kitchen tables, Patroclus, taking bread, served it out upon the board"
6460,ARGUMENT.,in beautiful baskets: but Achilles distributed the flesh. But he
6461,ARGUMENT.,"himself sat opposite to noble Ulysses, against the other wall, and"
6462,ARGUMENT.,"ordered Patroclus, his companion, to sacrifice to the gods; and he"
6463,ARGUMENT.,accordingly cast the first morsels 300 into the fire. And they
6464,ARGUMENT.,stretched forth their hands to the prepared viands which lay before
6465,ARGUMENT.,"them. But when they had dismissed the desire of eating and drinking,"
6466,ARGUMENT.,"Ajax nodded to Phoenix, but noble Ulysses observed it, and having"
6467,ARGUMENT.,"filled his goblet with wine, he pledged Achilles:"

6471,ARGUMENT.,
6472,ARGUMENT.,"“Health, Achilles. We are not wanting of a complete feast, either in"
6473,ARGUMENT.,"the tent of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, or even here also, for many"
6474,ARGUMENT.,strength-recruiting dainties are here; but the business of an agreeable
6475,ARGUMENT.,"feast is not our care. We, O thou Jove-nurtured one, contemplating it,"
6476,ARGUMENT.,"rather dread a very great disaster, as it is matter of doubt whether"
6477,ARGUMENT.,"the well-benched ships be saved or destroyed, unless thou puttest on"
6478,ARGUMENT.,thy might. For near the ships and the wall the high-minded Trojans and
6479,ARGUMENT.,"their far-summoned allies have pitched their camp, kindling many fires"
6480,ARGUMENT.,throughout the host; and they say that they will no longer restrain
6481,ARGUMENT.,"themselves, but that they will fall upon our black vessels. 301 And"
6482,ARGUMENT.,"Saturnian Jove exhibiting to them propitious signs, darts his"
6483,ARGUMENT.,"lightning; and Hector, looking fiercely round in valour, rages"
6484,ARGUMENT.,"terribly, trusting in Jove, nor reverences at all either men or gods,"
6485,ARGUMENT.,but great madness hath come upon him. He prays that divine morn may
6486,ARGUMENT.,speedily come. For he declares that he will cut off the poop-ends 302
6487,ARGUMENT.,"of the ships, and burn [the ships] themselves with ravaging fire, and"
6488,ARGUMENT.,"slaughter the Greeks beside them, discomforted by the smoke. Wherefore"
6489,ARGUMENT.,"do I greatly fear in my mind lest the gods may fulfil his threats, and"
6490,ARGUMENT.,"it be destined for us to perish in Troy, far from steed-nourishing"
6491,ARGUMENT.,"Argos. Rise then, if thou hast the intention, although late, to defend"
6492,ARGUMENT.,the harassed sons of the Greeks from the violent onslaught of the
6493,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans. To thyself it will hereafter be a cause of sorrow, nor is it"
6494,ARGUMENT.,possible in any manner to discover a remedy for a disaster when
6495,ARGUMENT.,"received; wherefore reflect much beforehand, how thou mayest avert the"
6496,ARGUMENT.,"evil day from the Greeks. O my friend, surely thy father Peleus charged"
6497,ARGUMENT.,"thee, on that day when he sent thee from Phthia to Agamemnon, ‘My son,"
6498,ARGUMENT.,"Minerva and Juno will bestow valour, if they choose; but restrain thy"
6499,ARGUMENT.,"great-hearted soul within thy breast, because humanity is better; and"
6500,ARGUMENT.,"abstain from injurious contention, that both the youth and elders of"
6501,ARGUMENT.,"the Greeks may honour thee the more.’ Thus did the old man give charge,"
6502,ARGUMENT.,"but thou art forgetful. Yet even now desist, and lay aside thy"
6503,ARGUMENT.,"mind-corroding wrath. To thee Agamemnon gives worthy gifts, ceasing"
6504,ARGUMENT.,"from indignation. But if [thou wilt] hear from me, and I will repeat to"
6505,ARGUMENT.,thee how many presents Agamemnon in his tents hath promised thee: seven
6506,ARGUMENT.,"tripods, untouched by the fire, and ten talents of gold, twenty shining"
6507,ARGUMENT.,"caldrons, and twelve stout steeds, victorious in the race, which have"
6508,ARGUMENT.,"borne off prizes by their feet. No pauper, nor in want of precious"
6509,ARGUMENT.,"gold, would that man be to whom so many prizes belonged as the steeds"
6510,ARGUMENT.,of Agamemnon have borne off by their fleetness. He will likewise give
6511,ARGUMENT.,"seven beautiful women, skilful in faultless works, Lesbians, whom he"
6512,ARGUMENT.,"selected when thou thyself didst take well-inhabited Lesbos, who then"
6513,ARGUMENT.,"excelled the race of women in beauty. These will he give thee, and"
6514,ARGUMENT.,"amongst them will be her whom once he took away, the daughter of"
6515,ARGUMENT.,"Briseïs; and he will moreover swear a mighty oath, that he never"
6516,ARGUMENT.,"ascended her bed, nor embraced her, as is the custom. O king, both of"
6517,ARGUMENT.,"men and women. All these shall immediately be in waiting; and if,"
6518,ARGUMENT.,"moreover, the gods grant that we pillage the vast city of Priam,"
6519,ARGUMENT.,"entering, thou mayest fill thy ships abundantly with gold and brass,"
6520,ARGUMENT.,"when we, the Greeks, divide the spoil. Thou shalt also choose twenty"
6521,ARGUMENT.,"Trojan women, who may be fairest next to Argive Helen. But if we reach"
6522,ARGUMENT.,"Achæan Argos, the udder of the land, thou mayest become his son-in-law,"
6523,ARGUMENT.,"and he will honour thee equally with Orestes, who is nurtured as his"
6524,ARGUMENT.,"darling son, in great affluence. But he has three daughters in his"
6525,ARGUMENT.,"well-built palace,—Chrysothemis, Laodice, and Iphianassa. Of these thou"
6526,ARGUMENT.,"shalt conduct the most beloved whomsoever thou mayest choose, without"
6527,ARGUMENT.,"marriage-gifts, to the house of Peleus; but he will give very many"
6528,ARGUMENT.,"dowries, such as no man yet gave his daughter. He will moreover give"
6529,ARGUMENT.,"thee seven well-inhabited cities,—Cardamyle, Enope, and grassy Ira,"
6530,ARGUMENT.,"glorious Pheræ, with deep-pastured Anthea, fair Æpeia, and vine-bearing"
6531,ARGUMENT.,"Pedasus; which are all near the sea, the last towards sandy Pylus. But"
6532,ARGUMENT.,"in them dwell men abounding in flocks and herds, who will honour thee"
6533,ARGUMENT.,"with gifts like a god, and under thy sceptre pay rich tributes. These"
6534,ARGUMENT.,will he fulfil to thee ceasing from thy wrath. But if indeed the son of
6535,ARGUMENT.,"Atreus himself and his gifts be more hateful to thee from thine heart,"
6536,ARGUMENT.,"at least have pity upon all the other Greeks, harassed throughout the"
6537,ARGUMENT.,"army, who will honour thee as a god; for surely thou wilt obtain very"
6538,ARGUMENT.,"great honour among them. For now mayest thou slay Hector, since he hath"
6539,ARGUMENT.,"already come very near thee, possessing destructive fury; since he"
6540,ARGUMENT.,declares that no one of the Greeks whom the ships have conveyed hither
6541,ARGUMENT.,is his equal.”

6551,ARGUMENT.,"opinion without reserve, even as I think, and as will be accomplished,"
6552,ARGUMENT.,"that ye may not, sitting beside me, keep whining 303 one after another."
6553,ARGUMENT.,Hateful to me as the gates of Hades is he who conceals one thing in his
6554,ARGUMENT.,mind and utters another. But I will speak as appears to me to be best;
6555,ARGUMENT.,"and I think that neither Agamemnon, the son of Atreus, nor the other"
6556,ARGUMENT.,Greeks will persuade me; since there is no gratitude to him who fights
6557,ARGUMENT.,ever ceaselessly with hostile men. An equal portion [falls] to him who
6558,ARGUMENT.,"loiters, as if one continually fight; and the coward is in equal honour"
6559,ARGUMENT.,"with the brave. The man of no deeds, and the man of many, are wont"
6560,ARGUMENT.,"equally to die; nor does anything lie by me as a store, 304 because I"
6561,ARGUMENT.,"have suffered sorrows in my soul, ever risking my life to fight. And as"
6562,ARGUMENT.,"the bird brings food to her unfledged young when she hath found it,"
6563,ARGUMENT.,although she fares badly herself; so have I too spent many sleepless
6564,ARGUMENT.,"nights, and gone through bloody days in combat, fighting with heroes"
6565,ARGUMENT.,for their wives’ sakes. Twelve cities indeed of men have I wasted with
6566,ARGUMENT.,"my ships, and on foot I say eleven throughout the fertile Troad. 305"
6567,ARGUMENT.,"From all these have I carried off many and precious spoils, and bearing"
6568,ARGUMENT.,"them, have given all to Agamemnon, the son of Atreus; whilst he,"
6569,ARGUMENT.,"remaining behind at the swift ships, receiving them, hath distributed"
6570,ARGUMENT.,"but few, but retained many. To the chiefs and kings hath he given other"
6571,ARGUMENT.,prizes; to whom indeed they remain entire: but from me alone of the
6572,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks hath he taken it away, and he possesses my spouse, dear to my"
6573,ARGUMENT.,"soul, with whom reclining, let him delight himself. But why is it"
6574,ARGUMENT.,necessary that the Greeks wage war with the Trojans? Or from what
6575,ARGUMENT.,"necessity did the son of Atreus, assembling an army, lead it hither?"
6576,ARGUMENT.,Was it not on account of fair-haired Helen? Do the sons of Atreus
6577,ARGUMENT.,"alone, of articulate-speaking men, love their wives? [Surely not],"
6578,ARGUMENT.,since whatever man is good and prudent loves and cherishes his spouse;
6579,ARGUMENT.,"thus I too loved her from my soul, though the captive of my spear. And"
6580,ARGUMENT.,"now since he hath snatched my reward from my hands, and deceived me,"
6581,ARGUMENT.,"let him not make trial of me, already well informed, for he will not"
6582,ARGUMENT.,"persuade me; but let him consider with thee, O Ulysses, and the other"
6583,ARGUMENT.,"kings, how he may repel the hostile fire from the ships. Assuredly he"
6584,ARGUMENT.,has already accomplished many labours without me. He has already built
6585,ARGUMENT.,"a rampart, and drawn a trench broad [and] large beside it; and planted"
6586,ARGUMENT.,in it palisades; but not even thus can he restrain the might of
6587,ARGUMENT.,"man-slaughtering Hector. Whilst I indeed fought amongst the Greeks,"
6588,ARGUMENT.,"Hector chose not to arouse the battle at a distance from the wall, but"
6589,ARGUMENT.,"he came [only] as far as the Scæan gates, and the beech-tree. There"
6590,ARGUMENT.,"once he awaited me alone, and with difficulty escaped my attack. But"
6591,ARGUMENT.,"since I choose not to war with noble Hector, to-morrow, 306 having"
6592,ARGUMENT.,"performed sacrifices to Jove and all the gods, [and] having well laden"
6593,ARGUMENT.,"my ships, when I shall have drawn them down to the sea, thou shalt"
6594,ARGUMENT.,"behold, if thou wilt, and if such things be a care to thee, my ships"
6595,ARGUMENT.,"early in the morn sailing upon the fishy Hellespont, and men within"
6596,ARGUMENT.,"them, eager for rowing; and if glorious Neptune grant but a prosperous"
6597,ARGUMENT.,"voyage, on the third day I shall surely reach fertile Phthia. 307 Now"
6598,ARGUMENT.,"there I have very many possessions, which I left, coming hither, to my"
6599,ARGUMENT.,"loss. 308 And I will carry hence other gold and ruddy brass,"
6600,ARGUMENT.,"well-girdled women, and hoary iron, which I have obtained by lot. But"
6601,ARGUMENT.,"the reward which he gave, king Agamemnon, the son of Atreus, hath"
6602,ARGUMENT.,himself insultingly taken from me: to whom do thou tell all things as I
6603,ARGUMENT.,"charge thee, openly, that the other Greeks also may be indignant, if"
6604,ARGUMENT.,"he, ever clad in impudence, still hope to deceive any of the Greeks;"
6605,ARGUMENT.,"nor let him dare, dog-like as he is, to look in my face. I will neither"
6606,ARGUMENT.,join in counsels nor in any action with him; for he hath already
6607,ARGUMENT.,"deceived and offended me, nor shall he again overreach me with words."
6608,ARGUMENT.,"It is enough for him [to do so once]: but in quiet 309 let him perish,"
6609,ARGUMENT.,for provident Jove hath deprived him of reason. Hateful to me are his
6610,ARGUMENT.,"gifts, and himself I value not a hair. 310 Not if he were to give me"
6611,ARGUMENT.,"ten and twenty times as many gifts as he now has, and if others were to"
6612,ARGUMENT.,"be added from any other quarter; nor as many as arrive at Orchomenos,"
6613,ARGUMENT.,"or Egyptian Thebes, 311 where numerous possessions are laid up in the"
6614,ARGUMENT.,"mansions, and where are one hundred gates, 312 from each of which rush"
6615,ARGUMENT.,out two hundred men with horses and chariots. Nor if he were to give me
6616,ARGUMENT.,"as many as are the sands and dust, not even thus shall Agamemnon now"
6617,ARGUMENT.,"persuade my mind, until he indemnify me for all his mind-grieving"
6618,ARGUMENT.,"insult. But I will not wed the daughter of Agamemnon, the son of"
6619,ARGUMENT.,"Atreus, not if she were fit to contend in beauty with golden Venus, or"
6620,ARGUMENT.,were equal in accomplishments to azure-eyed Minerva; not even thus will
6621,ARGUMENT.,"I wed her. Let him then select another of the Greeks who may suit him,"
6622,ARGUMENT.,"and who is more the king; for if the gods preserve me, and I reach"
6623,ARGUMENT.,"home, then will Peleus himself hereafter bestow upon me a lady in"
6624,ARGUMENT.,"marriage. There are many Grecian women throughout Hellas and Phthia,"
6625,ARGUMENT.,daughters of chieftains who defend the cities. Whomsoever of these I
6626,ARGUMENT.,"may choose, I will make my beloved wife; and there my generous soul"
6627,ARGUMENT.,"very much desires that I, wedding a betrothed spouse, a fit partner of"
6628,ARGUMENT.,"my bed, should enjoy the possessions which aged Peleus hath acquired."
6629,ARGUMENT.,For not worth my life are all the [treasures] which they say the
6630,ARGUMENT.,"well-inhabited city Ilium possessed, whilst formerly at peace, before"
6631,ARGUMENT.,the sons of the Greeks arrived; nor all which the stony threshold of
6632,ARGUMENT.,"the archer Phœbus Apollo contains within it, in rocky Pytho. 313 By"
6633,ARGUMENT.,"plunder, oxen and fat sheep are to be procured, tripods are to be"
6634,ARGUMENT.,"procured, and the yellow heads of steeds; but the life of man cannot be"
6635,ARGUMENT.,"obtained nor seized, so as to return again, when once it has passed the"
6636,ARGUMENT.,"enclosure of the teeth. For my goddess mother, silver-footed Thetis,"
6637,ARGUMENT.,"declares that double destinies lead me on to the end of death. If, on"
6638,ARGUMENT.,"the one hand, remaining here, I wage war around the city of the"
6639,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans, return is lost to me, but my glory will be immortal; but if,"
6640,ARGUMENT.,"on the other hand, I return home to my dear fatherland, my excellent"
6641,ARGUMENT.,"glory is lost, but my life will be lasting, nor will the end of death"
6642,ARGUMENT.,speedily seize upon me. And to others also would I give advice to sail
6643,ARGUMENT.,"home, for ye will not find an end of lofty Ilium; for far-sounding Jove"
6644,ARGUMENT.,"hath stretched over it his hand, and the people have taken courage. But"
6645,ARGUMENT.,"do ye, departing, bear back this message to the chiefs of the Greeks,"
6646,ARGUMENT.,"for such is the office of ambassadors, that they devise within their"
6647,ARGUMENT.,"minds some other better plan, which for them may preserve their ships,"
6648,ARGUMENT.,"and the army of the Greeks in the hollow barks; since this, which they"
6649,ARGUMENT.,"have now devised, is not expedient for them, while I cherish my wrath."
6650,ARGUMENT.,"But let Phœnix, remaining here, recline beside us, that to-morrow, if"
6651,ARGUMENT.,"he will, he may follow me in the ships to my dear fatherland, although"
6652,ARGUMENT.,I will by no means lead him away by compulsion.”

6692,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but they all became mute in silence, marvelling at his"
6693,ARGUMENT.,"speech, for he answered with much vehemence. At length, however, the"
6694,ARGUMENT.,"aged knight, Phœnix, addressed him, shedding tears, for he greatly"
6695,ARGUMENT.,feared for the ships of the Greeks:
6696,ARGUMENT.,
6697,ARGUMENT.,"“If indeed, Ο illustrious Achilles, thou dost now meditate a return"
6698,ARGUMENT.,"within thy mind, nor art at all willing to repel the destructive fire"
6699,ARGUMENT.,"from the swift ships, because indignation hath fallen upon thy soul;"
6700,ARGUMENT.,"how then can I, my dear child, be left here alone by thee? for aged"
6701,ARGUMENT.,"Peleus, the breaker of steeds, sent me forth with thee on that day,"
6702,ARGUMENT.,"when he despatched thee from Phthia to Agamemnon, a boy, not yet"
6703,ARGUMENT.,"skilled either in equally-destroying war, nor in counsels where men"
6704,ARGUMENT.,also become illustrious. On which account he sent me forth to teach
6705,ARGUMENT.,"thee all these things, that thou mightest become both an orator in"
6706,ARGUMENT.,"words and a performer in deeds. Thus then, my dear child, I wish not at"
6707,ARGUMENT.,"length to be left by thee, not even if a god himself, having divested"
6708,ARGUMENT.,"me of old age, should promise that he would render me a blooming youth,"
6709,ARGUMENT.,"such as I was when first I quitted fair-damed Hellas, flying the"
6710,ARGUMENT.,"contentions of my father Amyntor, son of Ormenus; who was enraged with"
6711,ARGUMENT.,"me on account of a fair-haired concubine whom he himself loved, but"
6712,ARGUMENT.,"dishonoured his wife, my mother. But she continually would embrace my"
6713,ARGUMENT.,"knees in supplication, that I should first have connection with the"
6714,ARGUMENT.,"concubine, that she might loathe the old man. Her I obeyed, and did so;"
6715,ARGUMENT.,"but my father immediately perceiving it, uttered many execrations, and"
6716,ARGUMENT.,"invoked the hateful Erinnys, that no dear son, sprung from me, should"
6717,ARGUMENT.,"ever be placed upon his knees; and the gods ratified his execrations,"
6718,ARGUMENT.,both infernal Jove and dread Proserpine. Then my soul within my mind
6719,ARGUMENT.,could no longer endure that I should sojourn in the palace whilst my
6720,ARGUMENT.,"father was enraged. My friends, indeed, and relations, being much about"
6721,ARGUMENT.,"me, detained me there within the halls, entreating [me to stay]. Many"
6722,ARGUMENT.,"fat sheep and stamping-footed, crooked-horned oxen they slaughtered;"
6723,ARGUMENT.,many swine abounding in fat were stretched out to be roasted in the
6724,ARGUMENT.,"flame of Vulcan, and much of the old man’s wine was drunk out of"
6725,ARGUMENT.,"earthen vessels. Nine nights did they sleep around me: whilst, taking"
6726,ARGUMENT.,"it in turns, they kept watch; nor was the fire ever extinguished, one"
6727,ARGUMENT.,"in the portico of the well-fenced hall, and another in the vestibule,"
6728,ARGUMENT.,before the chamber-doors. But when at length the tenth shady night had
6729,ARGUMENT.,"come upon me, then indeed I rushed forth, having burst the"
6730,ARGUMENT.,"skilfully-joined doors of the apartment, and I easily overleaped the"
6731,ARGUMENT.,"fence of the hall, escaping the notice of the watchmen and the female"
6732,ARGUMENT.,"domestics. Afterwards I fled thence through spacious Hellas, and came"
6733,ARGUMENT.,"to fertile Phthia, the mother of sheep, to king Peleus; who kindly"
6734,ARGUMENT.,"received me, and loved me even as a father loves his only son, born in"
6735,ARGUMENT.,"his old age 314 to ample possessions. He made me opulent, and bestowed"
6736,ARGUMENT.,"upon me much people, and I inhabited the extreme shores of Phthia,"
6737,ARGUMENT.,"ruling over the Dolopians. Thee too, Ο godlike Achilles, have I"
6738,ARGUMENT.,"rendered what thou art, 315 loving thee from my soul; since thou"
6739,ARGUMENT.,"wouldst not go with another to the feast, nor take food in the mansion,"
6740,ARGUMENT.,"until I, placing thee upon my knees, satisfied thee with viands,"
6741,ARGUMENT.,"previously carving them, and supplied thee with wine. Often hast thou"
6742,ARGUMENT.,"wetted the tunic upon my breast, ejecting the wine in infant"
6743,ARGUMENT.,"peevishness. 316 Thus have I borne very many things from thee, and much"
6744,ARGUMENT.,"have I laboured, thinking this, that since the gods have not granted an"
6745,ARGUMENT.,"offspring to me from myself, I should at least make thee my son, O"
6746,ARGUMENT.,"Achilles, like unto the gods, that thou mightst yet repel from me"
6747,ARGUMENT.,"unworthy destiny. But O Achilles, subdue thy mighty rage; it is by no"
6748,ARGUMENT.,means necessary for thee to have a merciless heart. Flexible are even
6749,ARGUMENT.,"the gods themselves, whose virtue, honour, and might are greater [than"
6750,ARGUMENT.,"thine]. Even these, when any one transgresses and errs, do men divert"
6751,ARGUMENT.,"[from their wrath] by sacrifices and appeasing vows, and frankincense"
6752,ARGUMENT.,"and savour. For Prayers also are the daughters of supreme Jove, 317"
6753,ARGUMENT.,"both halt, and wrinkled, and squint-eyed; which following on Ate from"
6754,ARGUMENT.,"behind, are full of care. But Ate is robust and sound in limb,"
6755,ARGUMENT.,"wherefore she far outstrips all, and arrives first at every land, doing"
6756,ARGUMENT.,injury to men; whilst these afterwards cure them. 318 Whosoever will
6757,ARGUMENT.,"reverence the daughters of Jove approaching, him they are wont greatly"
6758,ARGUMENT.,"to aid, and hear when praying. But whosoever will deny and obstinately"
6759,ARGUMENT.,"refuse them, then indeed, drawing near, they entreat Saturnian Jove,"
6760,ARGUMENT.,"that Ate may follow along with him, that being injured [in turn], he"
6761,ARGUMENT.,"may pay the penalty. But Ο Achilles, do thou too yield honour to"
6762,ARGUMENT.,"accompany the daughters of Jove, which bends the minds of other brave"
6763,ARGUMENT.,"men; for if Atrides brought not gifts, and did not mention others in"
6764,ARGUMENT.,"futurity, but would ever rage vehemently, I for my part would not"
6765,ARGUMENT.,"advise that, casting away wrath, thou shouldst defend the Greeks,"
6766,ARGUMENT.,although greatly in need. But now he at once gives both many
6767,ARGUMENT.,"immediately, and promises others hereafter; moreover, he hath"
6768,ARGUMENT.,"despatched the best men to supplicate thee, having selected throughout"
6769,ARGUMENT.,the Grecian army those who are dearest to thyself; whose entreaty do
6770,ARGUMENT.,"not thou despise, nor their mission, although formerly fault was not to"
6771,ARGUMENT.,"be found with thee, because thou wert enraged. Thus also have we heard"
6772,ARGUMENT.,"the renown of heroes of former days, when vehement wrath came upon any,"
6773,ARGUMENT.,"[that] they were both appeasable by gifts, and to be reconciled by"
6774,ARGUMENT.,"words. I remember this ancient and by no means modern deed, of what"
6775,ARGUMENT.,"sort it was; and I will repeat it among you all, being friends. The"
6776,ARGUMENT.,"Curetes and Ætolians, obstinate in battle, fought around the city of"
6777,ARGUMENT.,"Calydon, and slaughtered each other; the Ætolians, in defence of lofty"
6778,ARGUMENT.,"Calydon, the Curetes, eager to lay it waste in war; for between them"
6779,ARGUMENT.,"had golden-throned Diana excited mischief, indignant because Œneus had"
6780,ARGUMENT.,not offered the first-fruits in sacrifice in the fertile spot of
6781,ARGUMENT.,"ground: 319 whilst the other gods feasted on hecatombs, but to the"
6782,ARGUMENT.,"daughter of mighty Jove alone he sacrificed not. Either he forgot, 320"
6783,ARGUMENT.,"or did not think of it, but he did greatly err in mind. But she, the"
6784,ARGUMENT.,"daughter of Jove, delighting in arrows, enraged, sent against [him] a"
6785,ARGUMENT.,"sylvan wild boar, with white tusks, which did much detriment, as is the"
6786,ARGUMENT.,"wont [of boars], to the land of Œneus. And many tall trees, one after"
6787,ARGUMENT.,"another, did he prostrate on the ground, with their very roots and the"
6788,ARGUMENT.,"blossom of their fruit. But him Meleager, son of Œneus, slew,"
6789,ARGUMENT.,assembling huntsmen and dogs from many cities; for he would not have
6790,ARGUMENT.,"been subdued by a few mortals: so mighty was he, and he caused many to"
6791,ARGUMENT.,ascend the sad funeral-pile. Still she (Diana) excited around him 321 a
6792,ARGUMENT.,"great tumult and war between the Curetes and magnanimous Ætolians, for"
6793,ARGUMENT.,the head and bristly skin of the boar. 322 Whilst warlike Meleager
6794,ARGUMENT.,"fought, so long were the Curetes unsuccessful; nor were they able,"
6795,ARGUMENT.,"although numerous, to remain without the wall. But when wrath, which"
6796,ARGUMENT.,"swells the minds of others, though very prudent, within their breasts,"
6797,ARGUMENT.,"came upon Meleager, for, enraged at heart with his dear mother Althæa,"
6798,ARGUMENT.,"he remained inactive beside his wedded wife, fair Cleopatra, daughter"
6799,ARGUMENT.,"of Marpessa, the handsome-footed child of Evenus and Idas, who was then"
6800,ARGUMENT.,"the bravest of earthly men, and even lifted a bow against king Phœbus"
6801,ARGUMENT.,"Apollo, for the sake of his fair-ankled spouse. Her [Cleopatra] then"
6802,ARGUMENT.,her father and venerable mother in the palace were accustomed to call
6803,ARGUMENT.,"by the surname of Alcyone, because her mother, having the plaintive"
6804,ARGUMENT.,"note of sad Alcyone, 323 lamented when far-darting Phœbus Apollo stole"
6805,ARGUMENT.,"her away. Beside her he [Meleager] remained inactive, brooding 324 over"
6806,ARGUMENT.,"his sad anger, enraged because of the curses of his mother, who, much"
6807,ARGUMENT.,"grieving, prayed to the gods on account of the murder of her brethren."
6808,ARGUMENT.,"325 Often with her hands did she strike the fruitful earth, calling"
6809,ARGUMENT.,"upon Pluto and dread Proserpine, reclining upon her knees, whilst her"
6810,ARGUMENT.,"bosom was bedewed with tears, to give death to her son: but her the"
6811,ARGUMENT.,"Erinnys, wandering in gloom, possessing an implacable heart, heard from"
6812,ARGUMENT.,Erebus. Then immediately was there noise and tumult of these 326
6813,ARGUMENT.,"excited round the gates, the towers being battered. Then did the elders"
6814,ARGUMENT.,"of the Ætolians entreat him, and sent chosen priests to the gods, that"
6815,ARGUMENT.,"he would come forth and defend them, promising a great gift. Where the"
6816,ARGUMENT.,"soil of fertile Calydon was richest, there they ordered him to choose a"
6817,ARGUMENT.,"beautiful enclosure of fifty acres; the one half, of land fit for"
6818,ARGUMENT.,"vines, to cut off the other half of plain land, free from wood, for"
6819,ARGUMENT.,"tillage. Much did aged Œneus, breaker of steeds, beseech him, having"
6820,ARGUMENT.,"ascended to the threshold of his lofty-roofed chamber, shaking the"
6821,ARGUMENT.,"well-glued door-post, supplicating his son. And much also his sisters"
6822,ARGUMENT.,"and venerable mother entreated him, but he the more refused; and much"
6823,ARGUMENT.,[prayed] the companions who were dearest and most friendly of all; but
6824,ARGUMENT.,"not even thus did they persuade the soul within his breast, until his"
6825,ARGUMENT.,"chamber was violently assailed, and the Curetes were in the act of"
6826,ARGUMENT.,"scaling the ramparts, and firing the great city. Then indeed at length"
6827,ARGUMENT.,"his fair-girdled spouse, weeping, supplicated Meleager, and recounted"
6828,ARGUMENT.,"all the disasters, as many as happen to men whose city may be taken. In"
6829,ARGUMENT.,"the first place, they slay the men, 327 whilst fire reduces the city to"
6830,ARGUMENT.,ashes; and others carry off the children and deep-zoned women. Then was
6831,ARGUMENT.,"his soul disturbed when he heard of evil deeds, and he hasted to go and"
6832,ARGUMENT.,gird the all-glittering armour around his body. Thus he repelled the
6833,ARGUMENT.,"evil day from the Ætolians, yielding to his own inclination; but they"
6834,ARGUMENT.,did not make good to him the many and pleasing gifts; but he
6835,ARGUMENT.,nevertheless warded off evil. But revolve not such things within thy
6836,ARGUMENT.,"mind, O my friend, nor let the deity 328 thus turn thee, since it would"
6837,ARGUMENT.,be more dishonourable to assist the ships [when already] set on fire.
6838,ARGUMENT.,"Rather come for the gifts, for the Greeks will honour thee equally with"
6839,ARGUMENT.,"a god. If again without gifts thou enter the man-destroying battle,"
6840,ARGUMENT.,"thou wilt not receive equal honour, although warding off the war.”"
6841,ARGUMENT.,
6842,ARGUMENT.,"But him swift-footed Achilles, answering, addressed: “Phœnix, respected"
6843,ARGUMENT.,"father, old man, Jove-nurtured, to me there is no need of this honour,"
6844,ARGUMENT.,"for I conceive that I have been honoured by the behest of Jove, which"
6845,ARGUMENT.,"will detain me at the crooked ships whilst breath remains in my bosom,"
6846,ARGUMENT.,and my knees have the power of motion. But I will tell thee something
6847,ARGUMENT.,"else, and do thou revolve it in thy mind. Disturb not my soul, weeping"
6848,ARGUMENT.,"and lamenting, gratifying the hero Atrides; it is not at all necessary"
6849,ARGUMENT.,"that thou love him, that thou mayest not be hated by me, who love thee."
6850,ARGUMENT.,It is proper for thee with me to give annoyance to him who hath annoyed
6851,ARGUMENT.,"me. Rule equally with me, and receive my honour in half. 329 These will"
6852,ARGUMENT.,"bear back my message; but do thou, remaining here, recline upon a soft"
6853,ARGUMENT.,"bed, and with morn appearing let us consult whether we shall return to"
6854,ARGUMENT.,our native land or remain.”

6920,ARGUMENT.,
6921,ARGUMENT.,"“O Jove-born son of Laertes, crafty Ulysses, let us go, for the object"
6922,ARGUMENT.,"of our address appears not to me to be attainable, in this way at"
6923,ARGUMENT.,"least, and we must report the message to the Greeks with all haste,"
6924,ARGUMENT.,although it be not good. They now sit expecting us; but Achilles stores
6925,ARGUMENT.,"up within his breast a fierce and haughty soul, unyielding; nor does he"
6926,ARGUMENT.,"regard the friendship of his companions, with which we have honoured"
6927,ARGUMENT.,him at the ships beyond others. Merciless one! and truly some one hath
6928,ARGUMENT.,"accepted compensation even for a brother’s death, or his own son slain,"
6929,ARGUMENT.,"whilst [the murderer] remains at home among his people, having paid"
6930,ARGUMENT.,many expiations: and the mind and noble soul of the other is appeased
6931,ARGUMENT.,upon his having received compensation. But in thy breast the gods have
6932,ARGUMENT.,"put an unyielding and evil mind, for the sake of a maid only; whereas"
6933,ARGUMENT.,"we now offer thee seven far excelling, and many other gifts beside"
6934,ARGUMENT.,them. Do thou then assume a propitious disposition; and have respect to
6935,ARGUMENT.,"thy house, for we are guests beneath thy roof from the multitude of the"
6936,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks, and desire to be most dear and friendly to thee beyond all the"
6937,ARGUMENT.,"Achæans, as many as they are.”"
6938,ARGUMENT.,
6939,ARGUMENT.,"But him swift-footed Achilles, answering, addressed: “Most noble Ajax,"
6940,ARGUMENT.,"son of Telamon, chief of the people, thou appearest to me to have said"
6941,ARGUMENT.,"all this from thy soul, yet does my heart swell with indignation as"
6942,ARGUMENT.,"often as I recollect those things, how the son of Atreus hath rendered"
6943,ARGUMENT.,"me dishonoured among the Greeks, as if it were some contemptible"
6944,ARGUMENT.,"stranger. But go ye, and carry back my message, for I shall not think"
6945,ARGUMENT.,"of bloody war, before the son of warlike Priam, noble Hector,"
6946,ARGUMENT.,"slaughtering the Greeks, shall reach the ships of the Myrmidons, and"
6947,ARGUMENT.,"burn the ships with fire. But about my tent and black ship, however, I"
6948,ARGUMENT.,"think that Hector, although eager, will desist from combat.”"
6949,ARGUMENT.,
6950,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spake; but they, each having seized a double goblet, having"
6951,ARGUMENT.,"made libations, went back by the side of the fleet, and Ulysses led the"
6952,ARGUMENT.,way. But Patroclus gave orders to his companions and female domestics
6953,ARGUMENT.,"to strew, with all haste, a thick couch for Phœnix; and they, obedient,"
6954,ARGUMENT.,"spread a bed as he desired,—sheep-skins, coverlets, and the fine fabric"
6955,ARGUMENT.,"of flax: there lay the old man, and awaited heavenly Morn. But Achilles"
6956,ARGUMENT.,"slept in the recess of his well-made tent; and beside him lay a lady,"
6957,ARGUMENT.,"fair-cheeked Diomede, daughter of Phorbas, whom he had brought from"
6958,ARGUMENT.,Lesbos. And Patroclus on the other side reclined: and by him also lay
6959,ARGUMENT.,"fair-waisted Iphis, whom noble Achilles gave him, having taken lofty"
6960,ARGUMENT.,"Scyros, a city of Enyeus."
6961,ARGUMENT.,
6962,ARGUMENT.,"But when they were within the tents of Atrides, the sons of the Greeks,"
6963,ARGUMENT.,"rising one after another, received them with golden cups, and"
6964,ARGUMENT.,"interrogated thus. And first the king of men, Agamemnon, inquired:"
6965,ARGUMENT.,
6966,ARGUMENT.,"“Come, tell me, O Ulysses, much praised, great glory of the Greeks,"
6967,ARGUMENT.,"whether does he wish to ward off the hostile fire from the ships, or"
6968,ARGUMENT.,"has he refused, and does wrath still posses his haughty soul?”"
6969,ARGUMENT.,
6970,ARGUMENT.,"But him much-enduring, noble Ulysses then addressed: “Most glorious son"
6971,ARGUMENT.,"of Atreus, Agamemnon, king of men, he wills not to extinguish his"
6972,ARGUMENT.,"wrath, but is the more filled with anger, and despises thee as well as"
6973,ARGUMENT.,"thy gifts. He bids thee thyself consult with the Greeks, in what manner"
6974,ARGUMENT.,"thou mayest preserve both the ships and the army of the Greeks, but has"
6975,ARGUMENT.,"himself threatened, that with the rising dawn he will launch into the"
6976,ARGUMENT.,"main his well-benched, equally-plied vessels. And he has declared that"
6977,ARGUMENT.,"he would advise others also to sail home, since ye will not now effect"
6978,ARGUMENT.,the destruction of lofty Ilium; for far-resounding Jove hath greatly
6979,ARGUMENT.,"stretched forth his hand [over it], and the people have taken courage."
6980,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; and here are these who followed me, Ajax, and the two"
6981,ARGUMENT.,"heralds, both prudent men, to tell these things. But aged Phœnix hath"
6982,ARGUMENT.,"lain down there, for thus he ordered, that in the morning, if he chose,"
6983,ARGUMENT.,he might follow him in the ships to his dear father-land; but he will
6984,ARGUMENT.,by no means carry him off against his will.”
6985,ARGUMENT.,
6986,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spake; and they all became mute in silence, marvelling at his"
6987,ARGUMENT.,"speech, for he harangued with great vehemence. Long were the sorrowing"
6988,ARGUMENT.,"sons of the Greeks mute, till at length Diomede, valiant in the din of"
6989,ARGUMENT.,"battle, addressed them:"
6990,ARGUMENT.,
6991,ARGUMENT.,"“Most glorious son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon, would that thou"
6992,ARGUMENT.,"hadst not supplicated the illustrious son of Peleus, offering countless"
6993,ARGUMENT.,"gifts, for he is haughty even otherwise: 330 now again hast thou"
6994,ARGUMENT.,"excited him much more to insolence. Let us, however, leave him alone,"
6995,ARGUMENT.,"whether he go or remain, for he will fight again at that time when his"
6996,ARGUMENT.,"mind within his breast urges, and the Deity incites him. But come, let"
6997,ARGUMENT.,"us all obey as I shall advise: go now to rest, having satisfied your"
6998,ARGUMENT.,"hearts with food and wine, for this is force and vigour. But when fair"
6999,ARGUMENT.,"rosy-fingered morn has shone forth, draw up the infantry and cavalry"
7000,ARGUMENT.,"with all haste before the ships, cheering them: and do thou thyself"

7020,ARGUMENT.,"Diomede and Ulysses, as spies, penetrate the camp of the Trojans by"
7021,ARGUMENT.,"night, and first entrap and slay Dolon, who had set out on the same"
7022,ARGUMENT.,errand for the Trojans. Having obtained from him the desired
7023,ARGUMENT.,"information, they then attack the Thracians, and slay their king,"

7027,ARGUMENT.,
7028,ARGUMENT.,"The other chiefs, indeed, of all the Greeks were sleeping the whole"
7029,ARGUMENT.,"night at the ships, overcome by soft slumber; but sweet sleep possessed"
7030,ARGUMENT.,"not Agamemnon, the son of Atreus, shepherd of the people, revolving"
7031,ARGUMENT.,many things in his mind. As when the husband of fair-haired Juno
7032,ARGUMENT.,"thunders, preparing either an abundant, immense shower, or hail or"
7033,ARGUMENT.,"snow, when the snow whitens the fields; or somewhere [preparing] the"
7034,ARGUMENT.,wide mouth 332 of bitter war; so frequently groaned Agamemnon in his
7035,ARGUMENT.,"breast from the bottom of his heart, and his mind was troubled within"
7036,ARGUMENT.,"him. As often indeed as he looked towards the Trojan plain, he wondered"
7037,ARGUMENT.,"at the many fires which were burning before Ilium, the sound of flutes"
7038,ARGUMENT.,"and pipes, and the tumult of men. But when he looked towards the ships"
7039,ARGUMENT.,"and army of the Greeks, he tore up many hairs from his head by the"
7040,ARGUMENT.,"roots, 333 [enraged at] Jove who dwells aloft, and deeply he groaned in"
7041,ARGUMENT.,his noble heart. But this plan appeared best to him in his judgment; to
7042,ARGUMENT.,"repair first to Neleian Nestor, [and see] whether with him he might"
7043,ARGUMENT.,"contrive some blameless counsel, which might be an averter of evil."
7044,ARGUMENT.,"Rising, therefore, he wrapped his coat around his breast, and beneath"
7045,ARGUMENT.,his smooth feet bound the beautiful sandals; next he threw around him
7046,ARGUMENT.,"the blood-stained skin of a huge, tawny 334 lion, stretching to his"
7047,ARGUMENT.,"ankles, and grasped his spear. In like manner, a tremor possessed"
7048,ARGUMENT.,"Menelaus, for neither did sleep rest upon his eyelids, [through fear]"
7049,ARGUMENT.,"lest the Greeks should suffer aught, who on his account had come over"
7050,ARGUMENT.,"the wide sea to Troy, waging daring war. First with a spotted leopard’s"
7051,ARGUMENT.,"skin he covered his broad back; and next, lifting his brazen helmet,"
7052,ARGUMENT.,"placed it upon his head, and grasped a spear in his stout hand. But he"
7053,ARGUMENT.,"went to awaken his brother, who had the chief command of all the"
7054,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks, and was honoured by the people like a god. Him he found by the"
7055,ARGUMENT.,"prow of his ship, putting his bright armour around his shoulders; and"
7056,ARGUMENT.,"arriving, he was welcome to him. Him first Menelaus, valiant in the din"
7057,ARGUMENT.,"of war, addressed: “Why arm thus, my respected brother? Or whom dost"
7058,ARGUMENT.,thou urge of thy companions to go as a spy amongst the Trojans? In
7059,ARGUMENT.,"truth I very much fear that no one will undertake this deed, going"
7060,ARGUMENT.,alone through the dead of night to reconnoitre the enemy. Any one [who
7061,ARGUMENT.,does so] will be bold-hearted indeed.”

7076,ARGUMENT.,"will protect and preserve the Greeks and their ships, since the mind of"
7077,ARGUMENT.,Jove is altered. Surely he has rather given his attention to the
7078,ARGUMENT.,"Hectorean sacrifices; for never have I beheld, nor heard a person who"
7079,ARGUMENT.,"related, that one man has devised so many arduous deeds in one day as"
7080,ARGUMENT.,"Hector, dear to Jove, hath performed upon the sons of the Greeks in"
7081,ARGUMENT.,"such a manner, [although] the dear child neither of a goddess nor of a"
7082,ARGUMENT.,god. But such deeds hath he done as I conceive will long and for many a
7083,ARGUMENT.,day be a cause of care to the Greeks; so many evils hath he wrought
7084,ARGUMENT.,"against the Greeks. But go now, call Ajax and Idomeneus, running"
7085,ARGUMENT.,"quickly to their ships, but I will go to noble Nestor, and exhort him"
7086,ARGUMENT.,"to arise, if he be willing to go to the sacred company 335 of guards"
7087,ARGUMENT.,"and give orders; for to him will they most attentively listen, because"
7088,ARGUMENT.,"his son commands the guards, along with Meriones, the armour-bearer of"

7098,ARGUMENT.,"there with them, waiting till thou come, or shall I run back again to"
7099,ARGUMENT.,"thee, after I have duly given them orders?”"
7100,ARGUMENT.,
7101,ARGUMENT.,"But him, in turn, Agamemnon, king of men, addressed: “Wait there, lest,"

7103,ARGUMENT.,"the camp. But shout aloud whithersoever thou goest, and enjoin them to"
7104,ARGUMENT.,"be watchful, accosting each man by a name from his paternal race, 337"
7105,ARGUMENT.,"honourably addressing all; nor be thou haughty in thy mind. Nay, let"
7106,ARGUMENT.,"even us ourselves labour, whatever be our station, so heavy a calamity"
7107,ARGUMENT.,hath Jove laid upon us at our birth.”
7108,ARGUMENT.,
7109,ARGUMENT.,"Thus saying, he dismissed his brother, having duly charged him. But he"
7110,ARGUMENT.,"hastened to go to Nestor, the shepherd of the people. Him he found on"
7111,ARGUMENT.,"his soft couch beside his tent and black ship, and by him lay his"
7112,ARGUMENT.,"variegated arms, a shield, two spears, and a glittering helmet: beside"
7113,ARGUMENT.,"him also lay a flexible belt, with which the old man girded himself,"
7114,ARGUMENT.,"when he was arming for man-destroying war, leading on his people; since"
7115,ARGUMENT.,"he by no means yielded to sad old age. Being supported on his elbow,"
7116,ARGUMENT.,"338 and lifting up his head, he addressed the son of Atreus, and"

7134,ARGUMENT.,
7135,ARGUMENT.,"But him Agamemnon, king of men, then answered: “O Nestor, son of"
7136,ARGUMENT.,"Neleus, great glory of the Greeks, thou wilt recognize Agamemnon, the"
7137,ARGUMENT.,"son of Atreus, whom beyond all Jove hath plunged into toils"
7138,ARGUMENT.,"continually, whilst breath remains in my breast, or my knees have the"
7139,ARGUMENT.,"power of motion. I wander 339 thus, because sweet sleep sits not on"
7140,ARGUMENT.,"mine eyes, but war and the calamities of the Greeks are my care. For I"
7141,ARGUMENT.,"greatly fear for the Greeks, neither is my heart firm, but I am"
7142,ARGUMENT.,"confounded. 340 My heart leaps without my breast, and my fair limbs"
7143,ARGUMENT.,tremble beneath. But if thou canst do aught (since neither doth sleep
7144,ARGUMENT.,"come upon thee), come, let us go down to the guards, that we may see"
7145,ARGUMENT.,"whether, worn out by toil and [overpowered] 341 by sleep, they slumber,"
7146,ARGUMENT.,and are altogether forgetful of the watch. And hostile men are encamped
7147,ARGUMENT.,"near, nor do we at all know but that they perhaps meditate in their"
7148,ARGUMENT.,minds to engage even during the night.” 342
7149,ARGUMENT.,
7150,ARGUMENT.,"But him Nestor, the Gerenian knight, then answered: “Agamemnon, most"

7152,ARGUMENT.,"accomplish to Hector all those devices, which now, perhaps, he expects;"
7153,ARGUMENT.,but I think that he will labour under even more cares if Achilles shall
7154,ARGUMENT.,but turn away his heart from heavy wrath. Yet will I willingly follow
7155,ARGUMENT.,"thee; and let us moreover incite others, both spear-renowned Diomede,"
7156,ARGUMENT.,"and Ulysses, swift Ajax, and the valiant son of Phyleus. But if any one"
7157,ARGUMENT.,"going, would call godlike Ajax, and king Idomeneus; for their ships are"
7158,ARGUMENT.,"the farthest off, 343 and by no means near at hand. But I will chide"
7159,ARGUMENT.,"Menelaus, dear and respected though he be, nor will I conceal, even if"
7160,ARGUMENT.,"thou shouldst be displeased with me, since thus he sleeps, and has"
7161,ARGUMENT.,"permitted thee alone to labour. For now ought he to labour,"

7187,ARGUMENT.,"thoughtlessness of mind, but looking to me, and awaiting my"

7189,ARGUMENT.,"I have sent before to call those whom thou seekest. But let us go, and"

7200,ARGUMENT.,"was thick upon it: and he seized a doughty spear, pointed with sharp"

7203,ARGUMENT.,"Ulysses, equal to Jove in counsel. But the voice immediately penetrated"

7219,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spake, and much-counselling Ulysses returning into his tent,"

7221,ARGUMENT.,"But they proceeded to Diomede, the son of Tydeus, and him they found"
7222,ARGUMENT.,"without, before his tent, with his arms; and his companions slept"

7224,ARGUMENT.,spears were fixed erect upon the nether point; 345 and afar off
7225,ARGUMENT.,"glittered the brass, like the lightning of father Jove. The hero"
7226,ARGUMENT.,"himself however slumbered, and beneath him was strewed the hide of a"
7227,ARGUMENT.,wild bull; but under his head was spread a splendid piece of tapestry.
7228,ARGUMENT.,"Standing by him, the Gerenian knight Nestor awoke him, moving him on"
7229,ARGUMENT.,"the heel with his foot, 346 he roused him, and upbraided [him] openly:"
7230,ARGUMENT.,
7231,ARGUMENT.,"“Arise, son of Tydeus, why dost thou indulge in sleep all night?"

7246,ARGUMENT.,"labour. Are there not even other younger sons of the Greeks, who, going"

7248,ARGUMENT.,"man, thou art impossible to be wearied.”"
7249,ARGUMENT.,
7250,ARGUMENT.,"But him then the Gerenian knight Nestor in turn addressed: “Truly, my"

7252,ARGUMENT.,"blameless sons, and I have numerous troops, some of whom indeed, going"
7253,ARGUMENT.,"round, might give the summons. But a very great necessity hath"
7254,ARGUMENT.,"oppressed the Greeks, and now are the affairs of all balanced on a"
7255,ARGUMENT.,"razor’s edge 347, whether there be most sad destruction to the Greeks,"
7256,ARGUMENT.,"or life. Yet go now, since thou art younger, arouse swift Ajax, and the"

7262,ARGUMENT.,
7263,ARGUMENT.,Thus he spake; but the other threw around his shoulders the skin of a
7264,ARGUMENT.,"huge tawny lion, reaching to his feet, and took his spear. He hastened"
7265,ARGUMENT.,"forth, and the hero, having aroused the rest, led them thence."
7266,ARGUMENT.,
7267,ARGUMENT.,"But when they now came to the assembled guards, they found not the"
7268,ARGUMENT.,"leaders of the guards slumbering, but all were sitting vigilantly with"
7269,ARGUMENT.,"their arms. As dogs with care keep watch around the sheep in a fold,"
7270,ARGUMENT.,"hearing the furious wild beast, which comes through the wood from the"
7271,ARGUMENT.,"mountains, but much clamour of men and dogs is against it, and sleep is"
7272,ARGUMENT.,"utterly lost to them; so was sweet slumber lost to their eyelids,"
7273,ARGUMENT.,"keeping guard during the sad night, for they were ever turned towards"
7274,ARGUMENT.,"the plain, whensoever they heard the Trojans advancing. But the old man"
7275,ARGUMENT.,"seeing them, rejoiced, and encouraged them with a speech, and"
7276,ARGUMENT.,"addressing them, spoke winged words:"
7277,ARGUMENT.,
7278,ARGUMENT.,"“Thus now, dear children, keep watch; nor let sleep seize upon any,"
7279,ARGUMENT.,lest we become a mockery to the enemy.”
7280,ARGUMENT.,
7281,ARGUMENT.,"Thus saying, he crossed the trench; and with him followed the chiefs of"
7282,ARGUMENT.,"the Greeks, as many as had been summoned to the council. Along with"
7283,ARGUMENT.,"these went Meriones, and the illustrious son of Nestor; for they had"
7284,ARGUMENT.,"invited them, that they might consult with them. Having therefore"
7285,ARGUMENT.,"passed over the dug trench, they sat down in a clear space, where a"
7286,ARGUMENT.,"piece of ground appeared free from fallen dead bodies, whence impetuous"
7287,ARGUMENT.,"Hector had turned back, having destroyed the Greeks, when night at"
7288,ARGUMENT.,"length enveloped them. There sitting down, they addressed words to each"
7289,ARGUMENT.,"other, and to them the Gerenian knight Nestor began discourse:"
7290,ARGUMENT.,
7291,ARGUMENT.,"“O friends, would not now some man put such confidence in his own"
7292,ARGUMENT.,"daring mind as to go against the magnanimous Trojans, if perchance he"
7293,ARGUMENT.,"might take some of the enemy straying in the outskirts of the camp, or"
7294,ARGUMENT.,"perhaps even learn some report among the Trojans, what they deliberate"
7295,ARGUMENT.,among themselves; whether they intend to remain here by the ships at a
7296,ARGUMENT.,"distance, or are about to return to the city, since they have subdued"
7297,ARGUMENT.,"the Greeks? Could he but hear all this, and come back to us unscathed,"
7298,ARGUMENT.,"great glory would be his under heaven amongst all men, and he shall"
7299,ARGUMENT.,"have a good reward. For as many chiefs as command the vessels, of all"
7300,ARGUMENT.,"these each will give a black sheep, a ewe, having a lamb at its udders;"
7301,ARGUMENT.,to which indeed no possession will be like; and he will ever be present
7302,ARGUMENT.,at our banquets and feasts.”
7303,ARGUMENT.,
7304,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; and they were all mute in silence; but to them Diomede,"
7305,ARGUMENT.,"valiant in the din of battle, said:"
7306,ARGUMENT.,
7307,ARGUMENT.,"“Nestor, my heart and gallant spirit urge me to enter the camp of the"
7308,ARGUMENT.,"hostile Trojans, which is near; but if some other man were to go along"
7309,ARGUMENT.,"with me, there would be more pleasure, and it would be more"
7310,ARGUMENT.,"encouraging. For when two go together, the one perceives before the"
7311,ARGUMENT.,other how the advantage may be. But if one being alone should observe
7312,ARGUMENT.,"anything, his perception is nevertheless more tardy, and his judgment"
7313,ARGUMENT.,weak.”
7314,ARGUMENT.,
7315,ARGUMENT.,Thus he spoke: and the greater number wished to follow Diomede. The two
7316,ARGUMENT.,"Ajaces wished it, servants of Mars; Meriones wished it; the son of"
7317,ARGUMENT.,"Nestor very earnestly desired it; the spear-renowned son of Atreus,"
7318,ARGUMENT.,"Menelaus, desired it; and hardy Ulysses was eager to penetrate the"
7319,ARGUMENT.,crowd of the Trojans; for ever daring was his mind within his breast.
7320,ARGUMENT.,"Among them, however, Agamemnon, the king of men, spoke:"
7321,ARGUMENT.,
7322,ARGUMENT.,"“Diomede, son of Tydeus, most dear to my soul, select the companion"
7323,ARGUMENT.,"whom thou desirest, the bravest of those who present themselves, since"
7324,ARGUMENT.,"many are ready. Nor do thou, paying deference in thy mind, leave indeed"
7325,ARGUMENT.,"the better, and select as follower the worse, through respect [for"
7326,ARGUMENT.,"rank]; looking neither to family, nor whether one is more the king.”"
7327,ARGUMENT.,
7328,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spake, for he feared for yellow-haired Menelaus; but amongst"
7329,ARGUMENT.,"them Diomede, brave in the din of battle, again spoke:"
7330,ARGUMENT.,
7331,ARGUMENT.,"“If then ye now order me to select a companion myself, how can I now"
7332,ARGUMENT.,"forget godlike Ulysses, whose heart is prudent, and spirit gallant in"
7333,ARGUMENT.,"all labours; and whom Pallas Minerva loves. He following, we should"
7334,ARGUMENT.,"both return even from burning fire, for he is skilled in planning"
7335,ARGUMENT.,beyond [all others].”
7336,ARGUMENT.,
7337,ARGUMENT.,"But him much-enduring, noble Ulysses in turn addressed: “Son of Tydeus,"
7338,ARGUMENT.,"neither praise me beyond measure, nor at all blame, for thou speakest"
7339,ARGUMENT.,"these things amongst Argives, who are acquainted with them already. But"
7340,ARGUMENT.,"let us go, for night hastens on, and morn is at hand. The stars have"
7341,ARGUMENT.,"already far advanced, and the greater portion of the night, by two"
7342,ARGUMENT.,"parts, has gone by, but the third portion remains.”"
7343,ARGUMENT.,
7344,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having spoken, they clad themselves in their terrible arms. To"
7345,ARGUMENT.,"Diomede, Thrasymedes, firm in war, gave his two-edged sword, because"
7346,ARGUMENT.,"his own was left at the ships, and a shield. Upon his head he placed"
7347,ARGUMENT.,"his bull’s-hide helmet, coneless, crestless, which is called cataityx,"
7348,ARGUMENT.,"348 and protects the heads of blooming youths. And Meriones gave a bow,"
7349,ARGUMENT.,"quiver, and sword to Ulysses, and put upon his head a casque of hide;"
7350,ARGUMENT.,"and within, it was firmly bound with many straps; whilst without, the"
7351,ARGUMENT.,white teeth of an ivory-tusked boar set thick together on all sides
7352,ARGUMENT.,"fenced it well, and skilfully; and in the midst a woollen head-piece"
7353,ARGUMENT.,"349 was sewed. It Autolycus once brought from Eleon, the city of"
7354,ARGUMENT.,"Amyntor, son of Hormenus, having broken into his large mansion. He gave"
7355,ARGUMENT.,"it, however, to Amphidamas, the Cytherian, to bear to Scandea, and"
7356,ARGUMENT.,"Amphidamas bestowed it upon Molus, to be a gift of hospitality, but he"
7357,ARGUMENT.,"gave it to his son Meriones to be worn. Then at last, being placed"
7358,ARGUMENT.,"around, it covered the head of Ulysses. But they, when they had girt"
7359,ARGUMENT.,"themselves in dreadful arms, hastened to advance, and left all the"
7360,ARGUMENT.,"chiefs at the same place. And to them near the way, Pallas Minerva sent"
7361,ARGUMENT.,"a heron upon the right hand: they did not discern it with their eyes,"
7362,ARGUMENT.,"because of the gloomy night, but heard it rustling. And Ulysses was"
7363,ARGUMENT.,"delighted on account of the bird, and prayed to Minerva:"
7364,ARGUMENT.,
7365,ARGUMENT.,"“Hear me, thou daughter of ægis-bearing Jove, who standest by me in all"
7366,ARGUMENT.,"labours, nor do I escape thy notice, having moved. 350 Now again do"
7367,ARGUMENT.,"thou, O Minerva, especially befriend me, and grant that, covered with"
7368,ARGUMENT.,"glory, we may return back to the well-benched barks, having performed a"
7369,ARGUMENT.,"mighty deed, which will surely occasion care to the Trojans.”"

7380,ARGUMENT.,
7381,ARGUMENT.,"Then Diomede, brave in the din of battle, next prayed: “Now hear me,"
7382,ARGUMENT.,"too, O daughter of Jove, invincible. Attend me, as once thou didst"
7383,ARGUMENT.,"attend my sire, the noble Tydeus, to Thebes, what time he went as an"
7384,ARGUMENT.,ambassador for the Achæans; he left the brazen-mailed Achæans at the
7385,ARGUMENT.,"Asopus, and he himself bore thither a mild message to the Cadmæans: but"
7386,ARGUMENT.,"when returning he performed many arduous deeds, with thy aid, O noble"
7387,ARGUMENT.,"goddess, when thou propitious didst stand beside him. Thus now"
7388,ARGUMENT.,willingly stand by and protect me; and in return I will sacrifice to
7389,ARGUMENT.,"thee a heifer of a year old, with broad forehead, untamed, which no man"
7390,ARGUMENT.,"hath yet brought under the yoke. This will I sacrifice to thee,"
7391,ARGUMENT.,encircling its horns with gold.”
7392,ARGUMENT.,
7393,ARGUMENT.,"Thus they spoke, praying; and Pallas Minerva heard them. But when they"
7394,ARGUMENT.,"had supplicated the daughter of mighty Jove, they hastened to advance,"
7395,ARGUMENT.,"like two lions, through the dark night, through slaughter, through"
7396,ARGUMENT.,"bodies through arms, and black blood."
7397,ARGUMENT.,
7398,ARGUMENT.,Nor did Hector allow the gallant Trojans to sleep; but he summoned all
7399,ARGUMENT.,"the chiefs together, as many as were leaders and rulers over the"
7400,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans. Having summoned them together, he framed prudent counsel:"
7401,ARGUMENT.,
7402,ARGUMENT.,"“Who, undertaking it for me, will accomplish this deed for a great"
7403,ARGUMENT.,reward? And there shall be sufficient payment for him; for I will give
7404,ARGUMENT.,"a chariot and two rough-maned steeds, which excel in speed at the swift"
7405,ARGUMENT.,"sailing ships of the Greeks, to him whosoever would dare (he will also"
7406,ARGUMENT.,"obtain glory for himself) to approach near the swift-sailing ships, and"
7407,ARGUMENT.,"learn whether the fleet ships are guarded as formerly, or whether, now"
7408,ARGUMENT.,"subdued by our hands, they meditate flight among themselves, nor wish"
7409,ARGUMENT.,"to keep watch during the night, overcome with grievous toil.”"
7410,ARGUMENT.,
7411,ARGUMENT.,Thus he spoke; but they were all still in silence. But among the
7412,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans there was one Dolon, the son of Eumedes, a divine herald, rich"
7413,ARGUMENT.,"in gold, and wealthy in brass, who in aspect indeed was deformed, but"
7414,ARGUMENT.,"[was] swift-footed, and he was an only [son] among five sisters. Who"
7415,ARGUMENT.,"then, standing by, addressed the Trojans and Hector:"
7416,ARGUMENT.,
7417,ARGUMENT.,"“Hector, my heart and gallant spirit urge me to approach the"
7418,ARGUMENT.,"swift-sailing ships, and gain information. But come, raise up thy"
7419,ARGUMENT.,"sceptre to me, and swear that thou wilt assuredly give me the horses"
7420,ARGUMENT.,"and chariot, variegated with brass, which now bear the illustrious son"
7421,ARGUMENT.,"of Peleus, and I will not be a vain spy to thee, nor frustrate thy"
7422,ARGUMENT.,expectation; for I will go so far into the camp till I reach the ship
7423,ARGUMENT.,"of Agamemnon, where the chiefs will perchance be consulting whether to"
7424,ARGUMENT.,fly or fight.”
7425,ARGUMENT.,
7426,ARGUMENT.,Thus he spoke; but he took the sceptre in his hand and swore to him:
7427,ARGUMENT.,"“Let Jove himself now be my witness, the loudly-thundering spouse of"
7428,ARGUMENT.,"Juno, that no other man of the Trojans shall be carried by these"
7429,ARGUMENT.,horses: but I declare that thou shalt entirely have the glory of them.”
7430,ARGUMENT.,
7431,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke, and indeed swore a vain oath; 351 nevertheless he"
7432,ARGUMENT.,encouraged him. Immediately he threw around his shoulders his crooked
7433,ARGUMENT.,"bow, and put on above the hide of a grey wolf, with a casque of"
7434,ARGUMENT.,weasel-skin upon his head; and seized a sharp javelin. And he set out
7435,ARGUMENT.,to go from the camp towards the ships: nor was he destined to bring
7436,ARGUMENT.,"back intelligence to Hector, returning from the ships. But when now he"
7437,ARGUMENT.,"had quitted the crowd of horses and men, he eagerly held on his way."
7438,ARGUMENT.,"But him godlike Ulysses observed advancing, and addressed Diomede:"
7439,ARGUMENT.,
7440,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 351: (return)  “There is no necessity for supposing that
7441,ARGUMENT.,"Hector meditated any deceit. The poet contemplates the event, which"
7442,ARGUMENT.,"frustrated his hopes, and rendered his oath nugatory.”—Kennedy."
7443,ARGUMENT.,
7444,ARGUMENT.,"“Hark! Diomede, a man comes from the camp; I know not whether as a spy"
7445,ARGUMENT.,"upon our vessels, or to plunder some of the dead bodies. But let us"
7446,ARGUMENT.,"suffer him first to pass by a little through the plain, and afterwards,"
7447,ARGUMENT.,"hastily rushing upon him, let us take him. If, however, he surpasses us"
7448,ARGUMENT.,"in speed, attacking him with the spear, let us continually drive him"
7449,ARGUMENT.,"from the camp towards the ships, lest by chance he escape towards the"
7450,ARGUMENT.,city.”
7451,ARGUMENT.,
7452,ARGUMENT.,"Then having thus spoken, they lay down out of the pathway among the"
7453,ARGUMENT.,"dead; but he, in thoughtlessness, ran hastily past. But when now he was"
7454,ARGUMENT.,as far off as is the space ploughed at one effort 352 by mules (for
7455,ARGUMENT.,they are preferable to oxen in drawing the well-made plough through the
7456,ARGUMENT.,"deep fallow), they indeed ran towards him; but he stood still, hearing"
7457,ARGUMENT.,a noise; for he hoped within his mind that his companions had come from
7458,ARGUMENT.,"the Trojans to turn him back, Hector having ordered. But when now they"
7459,ARGUMENT.,"were distant a spear’s cast, or even less, he perceived that they were"
7460,ARGUMENT.,"enemies, and moved his active knees to fly; and they immediately"
7461,ARGUMENT.,"hastened to follow. As when two rough-toothed hounds, skilled in the"
7462,ARGUMENT.,"chase, ever incessantly pursue through the woody ground either a fawn"
7463,ARGUMENT.,"or hare, whilst screaming it flies before; thus did Tydides and"
7464,ARGUMENT.,"Ulysses, sacker of cities, pursue him ever steadily, having cut him off"
7465,ARGUMENT.,"from his own people. But when now flying towards the ships, he would"
7466,ARGUMENT.,"speedily have mingled with the watch, then indeed Minerva infused"
7467,ARGUMENT.,"strength into Tydides, that none of the brazen-mailed Greeks might be"
7468,ARGUMENT.,"beforehand in boasting that he had wounded him, but he himself come"
7469,ARGUMENT.,"second; then gallant Diomede, rushing on him with his spear, addressed"
7470,ARGUMENT.,him:
7471,ARGUMENT.,
7472,ARGUMENT.,"“Either stop, or I will overtake thee with my spear; nor do I think"
7473,ARGUMENT.,that thou wilt long escape certain destruction from my hand.”
7474,ARGUMENT.,
7475,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 352: (return)  See the Scholiast, and Kennedy’s note."
7476,ARGUMENT.,
7477,ARGUMENT.,"He said, and hurled his spear, but intentionally missed the man. Over"
7478,ARGUMENT.,the right shoulder the point of the well-polished spear stuck in the
7479,ARGUMENT.,"ground. Then indeed he stood still, and trembled, stammering (and there"
7480,ARGUMENT.,"arose a chattering of the teeth in his mouth), pale through fear."
7481,ARGUMENT.,"Panting they overtook him, and seized his hands; but he weeping, spoke"
7482,ARGUMENT.,thus:
7483,ARGUMENT.,
7484,ARGUMENT.,"“Take me alive, and I will ransom myself; for within [my house] I have"
7485,ARGUMENT.,"brass, and gold, and well-wrought iron; from which my father will"
7486,ARGUMENT.,"bestow upon you countless ransoms, if he shall hear that I am alive at"
7487,ARGUMENT.,the ships of the Greeks.”
7488,ARGUMENT.,
7489,ARGUMENT.,"But him much-planning Ulysses answering addressed: “Take courage, nor"
7490,ARGUMENT.,"suffer death at all to enter thy mind; but come, tell me this, and"
7491,ARGUMENT.,state it correctly: Why comest thou thus alone from the camp towards
7492,ARGUMENT.,"the fleet, through the gloomy night, when other mortals sleep? Whether"
7493,ARGUMENT.,"that thou mightst plunder any of the dead bodies, or did Hector send"
7494,ARGUMENT.,thee forth to reconnoitre everything at the hollow ships? Or did thy
7495,ARGUMENT.,mind urge thee on?”
7496,ARGUMENT.,
7497,ARGUMENT.,"But him Dolon then answered, and his limbs trembled under him:"
7498,ARGUMENT.,"“Contrary to my wish, Hector hath brought me into great detriment, who"
7499,ARGUMENT.,promised that he would give me the solid-hoofed steeds of the
7500,ARGUMENT.,"illustrious son of Peleus, and his chariot adorned with brass. And he"
7501,ARGUMENT.,"enjoined me, going through the dark and dangerous 353 night, to"
7502,ARGUMENT.,"approach the enemy, and learn accurately whether the swift ships be"
7503,ARGUMENT.,"guarded as before, or whether, already subdued by our hands, ye plan"
7504,ARGUMENT.,"flight with yourselves, nor choose to keep watch during the night,"
7505,ARGUMENT.,overcome by severe toil.”
7506,ARGUMENT.,
7507,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 353: (return)  Buttm. Lexil. p. 369: “I translate θοὴ νύξ by
7508,ARGUMENT.,_the quick and fearful_ night; and if this be once admitted as the
7509,ARGUMENT.,"established meaning of the Homeric epithet, it will certainly be always"
7510,ARGUMENT.,"intelligible to the hearer and full of expression. ‘Night,’ says a"
7511,ARGUMENT.,"German proverb, ‘is no man’s friend;’ the dangers which threaten the"
7512,ARGUMENT.,"nightly wanderer are formed into a quick, irritable, hostile goddess."
7513,ARGUMENT.,"Even the other deities are afraid of her, who is (Il. Θ, 259) θεῶν"
7514,ARGUMENT.,"δμήτειρα καὶ ἀνδρῶν; and Jupiter himself, in the midst of his rage,"
7515,ARGUMENT.,refrains from doing what might be νυκτὶ θοὴ ἀποθύμια. Nor is the
7516,ARGUMENT.,epithet less natural when the night is not personified: for as ὀξεῖς
7517,ARGUMENT.,"καιροί are _dangerous_ times, so by this word θοή it may be intended to"
7518,ARGUMENT.,mark the swiftness and imminency of dangers which threaten men who go
7519,ARGUMENT.,διὰ νύκτα μέλαιναν.”
7520,ARGUMENT.,
7521,ARGUMENT.,But him crafty Ulysses smiling addressed: “Assuredly thy mind aimed at
7522,ARGUMENT.,"mighty gifts, the horses of warlike Æacides; but these are difficult to"
7523,ARGUMENT.,"be governed by mortal men, and to be driven by any other than Achilles,"
7524,ARGUMENT.,"whom an immortal mother bore. But come, tell me this, and state"
7525,ARGUMENT.,"correctly; where now, when coming hither, didst thou leave Hector, the"
7526,ARGUMENT.,"shepherd of the people? Where lie his martial arms, and where his"
7527,ARGUMENT.,steeds? And how [stationed are] the watches and tents of the other
7528,ARGUMENT.,Trojans? What do they consult among themselves? Do they meditate to
7529,ARGUMENT.,"remain there at a short distance from the ships, or will they return"
7530,ARGUMENT.,"again to the city, since, forsooth, they have subdued the Greeks?”"
7531,ARGUMENT.,
7532,ARGUMENT.,"But him Dolon, the son of Eumedes, again addressed: “Therefore will I"
7533,ARGUMENT.,"indeed detail these things to thee very correctly. Hector, with those,"
7534,ARGUMENT.,"as many as are counsellors, is deliberating upon plans at the tomb of"
7535,ARGUMENT.,"divine Ilus, apart from the tumult: but for the watches of which thou"
7536,ARGUMENT.,"inquirest, O Hero, no chosen [band] defends or watches the camp. But as"
7537,ARGUMENT.,"many as are the hearths of fires among the Trojans, those at them are"
7538,ARGUMENT.,"they to whom there is compulsion; 354 and they are both wakeful, and"
7539,ARGUMENT.,"exhort one another to keep watch. But the allies, on the contrary,"
7540,ARGUMENT.,"summoned from afar, are sleeping; for they commit it to the Trojans to"
7541,ARGUMENT.,"keep watch, for their children and wives lie not near them.”"
7542,ARGUMENT.,
7543,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 354: (return)  Construe, κατὰ τόσας μὲν πυρὸς ἐσχάρας, ὅσαι"
7544,ARGUMENT.,"ἰισὶ Τρώων, οἵδε οἶσιν ἀνάγκη ἐστὶν, ἐγρηγόρθασι, κ. τ. λ."
7545,ARGUMENT.,
7546,ARGUMENT.,But him much-planning Ulysses answering addressed: “In what manner now
7547,ARGUMENT.,"do they sleep: mingled with the horse-breaking Trojans, or apart? Tell"
7548,ARGUMENT.,"me, that I may know.”"
7549,ARGUMENT.,
7550,ARGUMENT.,"But him Dolon, the son of Eumedes, answered: “Therefore will I indeed"
7551,ARGUMENT.,"detail these things also very correctly. On the one hand, towards the"
7552,ARGUMENT.,"sea, [are] the Carians and Pœonians, armed with crooked bows, the"
7553,ARGUMENT.,"Lelegans, and Cauconians, and noble Pelasgians. Towards Thymbra, on the"
7554,ARGUMENT.,"other, the Lycians are allotted their place, and the haughty Mysians,"
7555,ARGUMENT.,"the horse-breaking Phrygians, and the Mæonian cavalry 355 warriors. But"
7556,ARGUMENT.,why inquire ye of me these things separately? For if ye are now eager
7557,ARGUMENT.,"to penetrate the host of the Trojans, those Thracians lately arrived"
7558,ARGUMENT.,"are apart, the last of all the others. And among them is their king"
7559,ARGUMENT.,"Rhesus, son of Eioneus. And his horses are the most beautiful and"
7560,ARGUMENT.,"largest I have seen. They are whiter than snow, and like to the winds"
7561,ARGUMENT.,in speed. And his chariot is well adorned with both gold and silver;
7562,ARGUMENT.,"and he himself came, wearing golden armour of mighty splendour, a"
7563,ARGUMENT.,"marvel to behold; which does not indeed suit mortal men to wear, but"
7564,ARGUMENT.,"the immortal gods. But now remove me to the swift ships, or, having"
7565,ARGUMENT.,"bound me with a cruel bond, leave me here until ye return, and make"
7566,ARGUMENT.,"trial of me, whether I have indeed spoken to you truly, or not.”"
7567,ARGUMENT.,
7568,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 355: (return)  _I.e._ charioteers.
7569,ARGUMENT.,
7570,ARGUMENT.,"But him then valiant Diomede sternly regarding, addressed: “Think not"
7571,ARGUMENT.,"within thy mind to escape from me, O Dolon, although thou hast reported"
7572,ARGUMENT.,"good tidings, since thou hast once come into my hands. For if indeed we"
7573,ARGUMENT.,"shall now release thee, or set thee at liberty, hereafter thou wouldst"
7574,ARGUMENT.,"surely return to the swift ships of the Achæans, either in order to"
7575,ARGUMENT.,"become a spy, or to fight against us. But if, subdued by my hands, thou"
7576,ARGUMENT.,"lose thy life, thou wilt not ever afterwards be a bane to the Greeks.”"
7577,ARGUMENT.,
7578,ARGUMENT.,"He said; and the other was preparing to supplicate him, taking him by"
7579,ARGUMENT.,"the chin with his strong hand; but he, rushing at him with his sword,"
7580,ARGUMENT.,"smote the middle of his neck, and cut through both the tendons; and the"
7581,ARGUMENT.,"head of him, still muttering, was mingled with the dust. From his head"
7582,ARGUMENT.,"they took the weasel-skin helmet, and the wolf skin, with the bent bow"
7583,ARGUMENT.,and long spear; and noble Ulysses raised them on high with his hand to
7584,ARGUMENT.,"Minerva, the goddess of plunder, and praying, spake:"
7585,ARGUMENT.,
7586,ARGUMENT.,"“Rejoice, O goddess, in these, for thee, first of all the immortals in"
7587,ARGUMENT.,"Olympus, do we invoke; but guide us likewise to the horses and tents of"
7588,ARGUMENT.,the Thracian men.”
7589,ARGUMENT.,
7590,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he said; and raising them high above himself, he hung them on a"
7591,ARGUMENT.,"tamarisk-branch. But beside it he placed a conspicuous mark, pulling up"
7592,ARGUMENT.,"handfuls of reeds, 356 and the wide-spreading branches of the tamarisk,"
7593,ARGUMENT.,lest they should escape their notice whilst they were returning through
7594,ARGUMENT.,the dark and dangerous night. Then both advanced onwards through arms
7595,ARGUMENT.,"and black blood; and proceeding, they came immediately to the band of"
7596,ARGUMENT.,"the Thracian heroes. But they were sleeping, overpowered with fatigue;"
7597,ARGUMENT.,"and their beautiful armour lay upon the ground beside them, carefully"
7598,ARGUMENT.,"in order, in three rows: and by each of them [stood] a yoke of horses."
7599,ARGUMENT.,"Rhesus slept in the midst, and beside him his swift horses were"
7600,ARGUMENT.,fastened by the reins to the outer rim 357 of the chariot. And Ulysses
7601,ARGUMENT.,"first observing, pointed him out to Diomede:"
7602,ARGUMENT.,
7603,ARGUMENT.,"“This [is] the man, O Diomede, and these [are] the horses, which Dolon,"
7604,ARGUMENT.,"whom we slew, pointed out to us. But come now, exert thy mighty"
7605,ARGUMENT.,strength; nor does it at all become thee to stand leisurely with thy
7606,ARGUMENT.,"armour. Loose therefore the steeds, or do thou slay the men, and the"
7607,ARGUMENT.,horses shall be my care.”
7608,ARGUMENT.,
7609,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 356: (return)  Συμμάρψας. Ernesti says: “Confregit leviter

7613,ARGUMENT.,with ἄντυγος understood.
7614,ARGUMENT.,
7615,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but into him azure-eyed Minerva breathed valour, and he"
7616,ARGUMENT.,"slaughtered, turning himself on every side, and a dreadful groaning"
7617,ARGUMENT.,arose of those smitten with the sword; and the earth grew red with
7618,ARGUMENT.,"blood. As when a lion, coming upon unprotected flocks of goats or"
7619,ARGUMENT.,"sheep, rushes upon them, designing evils, so fell the son of Tydeus"
7620,ARGUMENT.,"upon the Thracian men, until he had slain twelve. But much-counselling"
7621,ARGUMENT.,Ulysses—whomsoever Diomede standing beside struck with the sword—him
7622,ARGUMENT.,"Ulysses dragged backwards, seizing by the foot; meditating these things"
7623,ARGUMENT.,"in his mind, that the fair-maned steeds should pass through easily, nor"
7624,ARGUMENT.,"should tremble in spirit, treading on the corses; for as yet they were"
7625,ARGUMENT.,"unused to them. But when now the son of Tydeus had reached the king,"
7626,ARGUMENT.,"him, the thirteenth, he deprived of sweet life, panting; for by the"
7627,ARGUMENT.,counsel of Minerva an evil dream had stood over his head during the
7628,ARGUMENT.,"night, [in likeness of] the son of Œneus: but in the meantime patient"
7629,ARGUMENT.,Ulysses was untying the solid-hoofed steeds. With the reins he bound
7630,ARGUMENT.,"them together and drove them from the crowd, lashing them with his bow,"
7631,ARGUMENT.,because he thought not of taking with his hands the splendid lash from
7632,ARGUMENT.,the well-wrought chariot seat; and then he whistled as a signal to
7633,ARGUMENT.,"noble Diomede. But he remaining, was meditating what most daring deed"
7634,ARGUMENT.,"he should do; whether seizing the car, where lay the embroidered"
7635,ARGUMENT.,"armour, he should drag it out by the pole 358 or bear it away, raising"
7636,ARGUMENT.,it aloft; or take away the life of more of the Thracians. Whilst he was
7637,ARGUMENT.,"revolving these things within his mind, Minerva in the meantime"
7638,ARGUMENT.,"standing near, addressed noble Diomede:"
7639,ARGUMENT.,
7640,ARGUMENT.,"“Be mindful now of a return to the hollow ships, O son of magnanimous"
7641,ARGUMENT.,"Tydeus, lest thou reach them, having been put to flight; or lest some"
7642,ARGUMENT.,other god perchance arouse the Trojans.”
7643,ARGUMENT.,
7644,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 358: (return)  Understand κατὰ ῥυμοῦ.
7645,ARGUMENT.,
7646,ARGUMENT.,"Thus she spoke; and he understood the voice of the goddess speaking,"
7647,ARGUMENT.,and he quickly ascended the chariot. And Ulysses lashed on [the horses]
7648,ARGUMENT.,"with his bow, and they fled to the swift ships of the Greeks."
7649,ARGUMENT.,
7650,ARGUMENT.,Nor did silver-bowed Apollo keep a vain watch. When he beheld Minerva
7651,ARGUMENT.,"accompanying the son of Tydeus, enraged with her, he descended into the"
7652,ARGUMENT.,"vast army of the Trojans, and roused Hippocoön, a counsellor of the"
7653,ARGUMENT.,"Thracians, the gallant cousin of Rhesus. And he, leaping up from sleep,"
7654,ARGUMENT.,"when he beheld the place empty where the fleet horses had stood, and"
7655,ARGUMENT.,"the men panting amidst the dreadful slaughter, immediately then wept"
7656,ARGUMENT.,"aloud, and called upon his dear companion by name. A clamour and"
7657,ARGUMENT.,"immeasurable tumult of the Trojans running together arose, and they"
7658,ARGUMENT.,"looked with wonder at the marvellous deeds, which men having"
7659,ARGUMENT.,"perpetrated, had returned to the hollow ships."
7660,ARGUMENT.,
7661,ARGUMENT.,"But when now they came where they had slain the spy of Hector, there"
7662,ARGUMENT.,"Ulysses, dear to Jove, reined in his fleet steeds. But the son of"
7663,ARGUMENT.,"Tydeus, leaping to the ground, placed the bloody spoils in the hands of"
7664,ARGUMENT.,"Ulysses, and then ascended the chariot. And he lashed on the steeds,"
7665,ARGUMENT.,"and both, not unwilling, fled towards the hollow ships, for thither it"
7666,ARGUMENT.,"was agreeable to their minds [to go]. But Nestor first heard the sound,"
7667,ARGUMENT.,and said:
7668,ARGUMENT.,
7669,ARGUMENT.,"“O friends, leaders and rulers over the Greeks, shall I speak falsely,"
7670,ARGUMENT.,or say the truth? Still my mind impels me. The noise of swift-footed
7671,ARGUMENT.,steeds strikes upon my ears. O that now Ulysses and gallant Diomede
7672,ARGUMENT.,would immediately drive some solid-hoofed steeds from the Trojans! But
7673,ARGUMENT.,greatly do I fear in mind lest these bravest of the Greeks suffer aught
7674,ARGUMENT.,from the rude host of Trojans.”
7675,ARGUMENT.,
7676,ARGUMENT.,"Not yet was the whole speech uttered, when they themselves arrived."
7677,ARGUMENT.,"Then indeed they descended to the ground, and [their friends]"
7678,ARGUMENT.,"rejoicing, saluted them with the right hand and kind expressions. But"
7679,ARGUMENT.,[first] the Gerenian knight Nestor asked them:
7680,ARGUMENT.,
7681,ARGUMENT.,"“Come, tell me, most excellent Ulysses, great glory of the Greeks, how"
7682,ARGUMENT.,took ye these horses? [Whether] penetrating the camp of the Trojans; or
7683,ARGUMENT.,"did some god, meeting, supply you with them? They are very like unto"
7684,ARGUMENT.,"the rays of the sun. I indeed always mingle with the Trojans, nor can I"
7685,ARGUMENT.,"say that I remain at the ships, although being an old warrior: yet have"
7686,ARGUMENT.,"I never beheld nor remarked such horses, but I think that some god,"
7687,ARGUMENT.,"meeting you, hath given them. For cloud-compelling Jove loves you both,"
7688,ARGUMENT.,"and the daughter of ægis-bearing Jove, azure-eyed Minerva.”"
7689,ARGUMENT.,
7690,ARGUMENT.,"But him crafty Ulysses answering addressed: “O Nestor, offspring of"
7691,ARGUMENT.,"Neleus, great glory of the Greeks, a god indeed, if willing, could"
7692,ARGUMENT.,"easily have given better horses even than these, since they (the gods)"
7693,ARGUMENT.,"are much more powerful. But those steeds about which thou inquirest,"
7694,ARGUMENT.,"old man, are Thracian, lately arrived, and valiant Diomede slew their"
7695,ARGUMENT.,"lord, and beside him twelve companions, all of the bravest. The"
7696,ARGUMENT.,"thirteenth, a spy, we killed, near the ships, whom Hector sent forth,"
7697,ARGUMENT.,"and the other illustrious Trojans, to be a spy, forsooth, [of our"
7698,ARGUMENT.,army].”
7699,ARGUMENT.,
7700,ARGUMENT.,"Thus saying, he drove the solid-hoofed steeds across the ditch,"
7701,ARGUMENT.,"exulting, and with him went the other Greeks rejoicing. But when they"
7702,ARGUMENT.,"came to the well-constructed tent of Diomede, they tied the steeds by"
7703,ARGUMENT.,"the skilfully-cut reins to the horses’ stall, where stood the"
7704,ARGUMENT.,"swift-footed steeds of Diomede, eating sweet corn. In the stern of his"
7705,ARGUMENT.,"vessel Ulysses laid the bloody spoils of Dolon, until they could"
7706,ARGUMENT.,present them as a sacred gift to Minerva. Then having gone into the
7707,ARGUMENT.,"sea, they washed off the abundant sweat from around their legs, their"
7708,ARGUMENT.,"neck, and thighs. But when the wave of the sea had washed away the"
7709,ARGUMENT.,"abundant sweat from their bodies, and they were refreshed in their dear"
7710,ARGUMENT.,"heart, entering the well-polished baths, they bathed. But having bathed"
7711,ARGUMENT.,"and anointed themselves with rich oil, they sat down to a repast; and"
7712,ARGUMENT.,"drawing forth sweet wine from a full bowl, they poured it out in"
7713,ARGUMENT.,libation to Minerva.

7725,ARGUMENT.,"then go to the relief of Ajax, and Eurypylus, who had joined them, is"

7734,ARGUMENT.,"forth fell Discord to the swift ships of the Greeks, bearing in her"
7735,ARGUMENT.,hands the portent of war. And she stood upon the huge 359 black ship of
7736,ARGUMENT.,"Ulysses, which was in the centre, to shout to both sides, as well to"
7737,ARGUMENT.,"the tents of Telamonian Ajax, as to those of Achilles; who had both"
7738,ARGUMENT.,"drawn up their equal ships at the very extremities, relying on their"
7739,ARGUMENT.,"valour and strength of hands. There standing, the goddess shouted both"
7740,ARGUMENT.,"loudly and terribly, in Orthian strain, 360 to the Greeks, and"
7741,ARGUMENT.,"implanted mighty strength in the heart of each, to war and fight"
7742,ARGUMENT.,"incessantly. And immediately war became more sweet to them, than to"
7743,ARGUMENT.,return in the hollow ships to their dear fatherland. Then the son of
7744,ARGUMENT.,"Atreus shouted aloud, and ordered the Greeks to be girded; and arrayed"
7745,ARGUMENT.,"himself, putting on his shining armour. First he put upon his legs his"
7746,ARGUMENT.,"beautiful greaves, fitted with silver clasps; next he placed around his"
7747,ARGUMENT.,"breast a corslet which Cinyras once gave him, to be a pledge of"
7748,ARGUMENT.,"hospitality. For a great rumour was heard at Cyprus, that the Greeks"
7749,ARGUMENT.,"were about to sail to Troy in ships: wherefore he gave him this,"
7750,ARGUMENT.,gratifying the king. Ten bars indeed [of the corslet] were of dark
7751,ARGUMENT.,"cyanus 361, twelve of gold, and twenty of tin; and three serpents of"
7752,ARGUMENT.,"cyanus stretched towards the neck on each side, like unto rainbows,"
7753,ARGUMENT.,"which the son of Saturn hath fixed in a cloud 362, a sign to"
7754,ARGUMENT.,"articulate-speaking men. Then around his shoulders he hung his sword,"
7755,ARGUMENT.,"on which glittered golden studs; and a silver scabbard enclosed it,"
7756,ARGUMENT.,"fitted with golden rings. Next he took up his shield, mortal-covering"
7757,ARGUMENT.,"363, variously wrought, strong, beautiful, around which were ten brazen"
7758,ARGUMENT.,"orbs. Upon it were twenty white bosses of tin, and in the midst was"
7759,ARGUMENT.,[one] of dark cyanus. On it a grim-visaged Gorgon was placed as an
7760,ARGUMENT.,"ornament, looking horribly, and around [were] Terror and Flight. The"
7761,ARGUMENT.,"belt was of silver, but round it a snake of cyanus was twisted, and"
7762,ARGUMENT.,"there were three heads entwined, springing from one neck. Upon his head"
7763,ARGUMENT.,"also he placed his helmet, adorned with studs on all sides, having four"
7764,ARGUMENT.,"bosses, crested with horse-hair, and dreadfully nodded the tuft from"
7765,ARGUMENT.,"above. He then took two strong spears, tipped with brass, sharp; and"
7766,ARGUMENT.,"the brass of them glittered afar, even to heaven: and Minerva and Juno"
7767,ARGUMENT.,"thundered above, honouring the king of Mycenæ, rich in gold."
7768,ARGUMENT.,
7769,ARGUMENT.,Then indeed each gave orders to his own charioteer to hold there his
7770,ARGUMENT.,"horses in good order by the fosse; whilst they themselves on foot 364,"
7771,ARGUMENT.,"arrayed with their armour, rushed forth; and an inextinguishable"
7772,ARGUMENT.,clamour arose before morning. And they 365 were marshalled in the
7773,ARGUMENT.,foreground with the cavalry at the trench; the cavalry followed at a
7774,ARGUMENT.,"little interval; but the son of Saturn aroused a dreadful tumult, and"
7775,ARGUMENT.,"sent down dew-drops, moist with blood, from the air above, because he"
7776,ARGUMENT.,was about to hurl many brave souls on to Hades.
7777,ARGUMENT.,
7778,ARGUMENT.,"On the other side, on the contrary, the Trojans [drew up] on a hill in"
7779,ARGUMENT.,"the plain around both mighty Hector, blameless Polydamas, and Æneas,"
7780,ARGUMENT.,"who, among the Trojans, was honoured by the people as a god; and the"
7781,ARGUMENT.,"three sons of Antenor, Polybus, noble Agenor, and youthful Acamas, like"
7782,ARGUMENT.,"unto the immortals. And Hector in the van carried his shield, equal on"
7783,ARGUMENT.,all sides. And as when a pernicious star makes its appearance from the
7784,ARGUMENT.,"clouds, at one time shining, and dark again hath entered the clouds; so"
7785,ARGUMENT.,"Hector, giving orders, appeared now among the first, and now among the"
7786,ARGUMENT.,"last; and he glittered all over with brass, like the lightning of"
7787,ARGUMENT.,ægis-bearing Jove.

7807,ARGUMENT.,"fall,—so the Trojans and Greeks, rushing against one another, kept"
7808,ARGUMENT.,slaughtering: and neither thought of pernicious flight. And they held
7809,ARGUMENT.,"their heads equal in combat, and rushed on like wolves; whilst"
7810,ARGUMENT.,"lamentable Discord, looking on, exulted: for she alone of the gods was"
7811,ARGUMENT.,present with them contending. But the other gods were not present with
7812,ARGUMENT.,"them, but sat quiet in their palaces, where beautiful mansions were"
7813,ARGUMENT.,"built for each, along the summits of Olympus. All however blamed the"
7814,ARGUMENT.,"Saturnian collector of dark clouds, because he wished to afford glory"
7815,ARGUMENT.,"to the Trojans. But the sire did not regard them, but retiring by"
7816,ARGUMENT.,"himself, sat down apart from the others, exulting in glory, looking"
7817,ARGUMENT.,"both upon the city of the Trojans, and the ships of the Greeks, and the"
7818,ARGUMENT.,"brightness of armour, and the slaying, and slain."
7819,ARGUMENT.,
7820,ARGUMENT.,"Whilst it was morn, and the sacred day was increasing, so long the"
7821,ARGUMENT.,"weapons reached both sides, and the people fell. But at the time when"
7822,ARGUMENT.,"the wood-cutter 366 has prepared his repast in the dells of a mountain,"
7823,ARGUMENT.,"when he has wearied his hands hewing down lofty trees, and satiety"
7824,ARGUMENT.,"comes upon his mind, and the desire of sweet food seizes his breast;"
7825,ARGUMENT.,"then the Greeks, by their valour, broke the phalanxes, cheering their"
7826,ARGUMENT.,"companions along the ranks. But Agamemnon first leaped forth, and slew"
7827,ARGUMENT.,"the hero Bianor, the shepherd of the people, and then also his"
7828,ARGUMENT.,"companion, Oïleus, the goader of steeds. For he then, leaping from the"
7829,ARGUMENT.,"chariot, stood against him; but he (Agamemnon) smote him, as he was"
7830,ARGUMENT.,"rushing straight forward, with his sharp spear, in the forehead; nor"
7831,ARGUMENT.,"did the visor, heavy with brass, retard the weapon, but it penetrated"
7832,ARGUMENT.,"both it and the bone, and all the brain within was stained with gore."
7833,ARGUMENT.,"Him then he subdued while eagerly rushing on. And Agamemnon, king of"
7834,ARGUMENT.,"men, left them there with their bosoms all bare, for he had stripped"
7835,ARGUMENT.,"off their tunics. Next he went against Isus and Anthipus, two sons of"
7836,ARGUMENT.,"Priam, [the one] illegitimate, and [the other] legitimate, being both"
7837,ARGUMENT.,"in one chariot, in order to slay them. The spurious [son] guided the"
7838,ARGUMENT.,"chariot, whilst illustrious Antiphus fought. Them Achilles had once"
7839,ARGUMENT.,"bound with tender osiers on the summits of Ida, taking them while"
7840,ARGUMENT.,pasturing their sheep; and had liberated them for a ransom. Then
7841,ARGUMENT.,"however the son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon, struck one upon the"
7842,ARGUMENT.,breast above the pap with his spear; and again he smote Antiphus beside
7843,ARGUMENT.,"the ear with his sword, and hurled him from his chariot. Hastening up,"
7844,ARGUMENT.,"he despoiled them of their beautiful armour, recognizing them; for he"
7845,ARGUMENT.,"had formerly seen them at the swift ships, when swift-footed Achilles"
7846,ARGUMENT.,"brought them from Ida. And as a lion, returning to his lair, easily"
7847,ARGUMENT.,"crushes the little fawns of the fleet hind, seizing them in his strong"
7848,ARGUMENT.,"teeth, and deprives them of their tender life, whilst she, although she"
7849,ARGUMENT.,"happen [to be] very near, cannot aid them; for a dreadful tremor comes"
7850,ARGUMENT.,"upon herself; but hastening, she immediately flies through the thick"
7851,ARGUMENT.,"oak groves and the forest, sweating, through the attack of the wild"
7852,ARGUMENT.,beast. Thus no one of the Trojans was then able to avert destruction
7853,ARGUMENT.,"from these, but they themselves were put to flight by the Greeks. Next"
7854,ARGUMENT.,"[he attacked] Pisander and Hippolochus, brave in battle, the sons of"
7855,ARGUMENT.,"warlike Antimachus, who having accepted gold from Paris, rich gifts,"
7856,ARGUMENT.,would not suffer them to restore Helen to yellow-haired Menelaus. His
7857,ARGUMENT.,"two sons, then, Agamemnon, king of men, seized, being in one chariot,"
7858,ARGUMENT.,for they drove their fleet horses together; for the splendid reins had
7859,ARGUMENT.,"fallen from their hands, and they were confounded. But the son of"
7860,ARGUMENT.,"Atreus rushed against them like a lion, and they, on the contrary,"
7861,ARGUMENT.,supplicated [him] from the chariot:
7862,ARGUMENT.,
7863,ARGUMENT.,"“Take us alive, O son of Atreus, and thou shalt receive worthy ransoms."
7864,ARGUMENT.,"For many treasures lie in the houses of Antimachus, brass, gold, and"
7865,ARGUMENT.,variously-wrought iron. From these would our father give infinite
7866,ARGUMENT.,"ransoms, if he should hear that we were alive at the ships of the"
7867,ARGUMENT.,Greeks.”

7870,ARGUMENT.,"in xvi. 779, with Buttm. Lexil. p. 89."
7871,ARGUMENT.,
7872,ARGUMENT.,Thus both weeping addressed the king with soothing words; but heard an
7873,ARGUMENT.,"unsoothing reply: “If indeed ye be the sons of warlike Antimachus, who"
7874,ARGUMENT.,"once in an assembly of the Trojans, ordered that they should there put"
7875,ARGUMENT.,"to death Menelaus, coming as an ambassador along with godlike Ulysses,"
7876,ARGUMENT.,and not send him back to the Greeks—now surely shall ye pay the penalty
7877,ARGUMENT.,of the unmerited insolence of your father.”
7878,ARGUMENT.,
7879,ARGUMENT.,"He said, and hurled Pisander from his horses to the ground, striking"
7880,ARGUMENT.,him on the breast with his spear; and he was stretched supine upon the
7881,ARGUMENT.,"soil. But Hippolochus leaped down, whom next he slew upon the ground,"
7882,ARGUMENT.,"having lopped off his hands with his sword, and cut off his neck; and"
7883,ARGUMENT.,"it (the head) like a cylinder, he hurled forward, to be rolled through"
7884,ARGUMENT.,the crowd. These then he left there; and where very many phalanxes were
7885,ARGUMENT.,"thrown into confusion, there he rushed, and at the same time other"
7886,ARGUMENT.,"well-greaved Greeks. Infantry slew infantry, flying from necessity, and"
7887,ARGUMENT.,"horse [slew] horse, slaughtering with the brass (whilst the dust was"
7888,ARGUMENT.,"raised by them from the plain, which the loud-sounding feet of the"
7889,ARGUMENT.,"horses excited); but king Agamemnon, constantly slaying, pursued,"
7890,ARGUMENT.,cheering on the Greeks. And as when a destructive fire falls upon a
7891,ARGUMENT.,"woody forest, and the wind whirling carries it on all sides, whilst the"
7892,ARGUMENT.,"branches fall with the roots, overwhelmed by the violence of the flame;"
7893,ARGUMENT.,"so fell the heads of the flying Trojans, at the hand of Agamemnon, son"
7894,ARGUMENT.,"of Atreus, and many lofty-necked steeds rattled their empty chariots"
7895,ARGUMENT.,"through the ranks 367 of the battle, longing for their faultless"
7896,ARGUMENT.,"charioteers; but they lay upon the earth, far more agreeable to the"
7897,ARGUMENT.,vultures than to their wives.

7903,ARGUMENT.,"slaughter, blood and tumult, whilst Atrides pursued, loudly cheering on"
7904,ARGUMENT.,the Danai. [The Trojans] meanwhile rushed through the middle of the
7905,ARGUMENT.,"plain towards the wild fig-tree, near the tomb of Ilus, the descendant"
7906,ARGUMENT.,"of ancient Dardanus, eager to reach the city; but Atrides still"
7907,ARGUMENT.,"followed shouting, and stained his invincible hands with dusty gore."
7908,ARGUMENT.,"But when now they reached the Scæan gates and the beech-tree, there at"
7909,ARGUMENT.,"length they halted, and awaited each other. Others, however, still fled"
7910,ARGUMENT.,"through the middle of the plain, like oxen which a lion, coming at the"
7911,ARGUMENT.,"depth of night, hath put tremblingly to flight—all, but to some one"
7912,ARGUMENT.,dreadful destruction is apparent; whose neck he first completely
7913,ARGUMENT.,"breaks, seizing it in his strong teeth; and then laps up both the blood"
7914,ARGUMENT.,"and all the entrails: thus did the son of Atreus, king Agamemnon,"
7915,ARGUMENT.,"follow them, always killing the hindermost; and they kept flying. Many"
7916,ARGUMENT.,"fell prone and supine from their chariots, by the hands of the son of"
7917,ARGUMENT.,Atreus; for before [all others] he raged exceedingly with the spear.
7918,ARGUMENT.,"But when now he was about soon to reach the city and the lofty wall,"
7919,ARGUMENT.,"then indeed the father both of men and gods, descending from heaven,"
7920,ARGUMENT.,"seated himself upon the tops of Ida, of many rills. And he held the"
7921,ARGUMENT.,"lightning in his hands, and aroused golden-winged Iris to bear his"
7922,ARGUMENT.,message:
7923,ARGUMENT.,
7924,ARGUMENT.,"“Come, swift Iris, deliver this message to Hector. As long as he may"
7925,ARGUMENT.,"behold Agamemnon, the shepherd of the people, raging in the van, [and]"
7926,ARGUMENT.,"destroying the ranks of men, so long let 368 him retreat, and let him"
7927,ARGUMENT.,exhort the rest of the army to fight with the enemy during the violent
7928,ARGUMENT.,"contest. But when he (Agamemnon) shall have mounted his steeds, either"
7929,ARGUMENT.,"smitten by a spear, or wounded by an arrow, then will I supply him with"
7930,ARGUMENT.,"strength to slay, 369 until he reach the well-benched ships, and the"
7931,ARGUMENT.,"sun set, and sacred darkness come on.”"

7937,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spake; nor did rapid Iris, swift as the wind on her feet,"
7938,ARGUMENT.,"disobey. But she descended from the mountains of Ida, towards sacred"
7939,ARGUMENT.,"Ilium. She found noble Hector, son of warlike Priam, standing in the"
7940,ARGUMENT.,"midst of the horses and well-joined chariots: and having approached,"
7941,ARGUMENT.,swift-footed Iris addressed him:
7942,ARGUMENT.,
7943,ARGUMENT.,"“Hector, son of Priam, equal in counsel to Jove, Jove hath sent me"
7944,ARGUMENT.,forward to deliver to thee this message: As long as thou seest
7945,ARGUMENT.,"Agamemnon, the shepherd of the people, raging amongst the van, [and]"
7946,ARGUMENT.,"destroying the ranks of men, so long do thou abstain from combat, but"
7947,ARGUMENT.,exhort the rest of the army to fight with the enemy during the violent
7948,ARGUMENT.,"contest. But when he shall have mounted his steeds, either smitten with"
7949,ARGUMENT.,"a spear, or wounded by an arrow, then will he supply thee with strength"
7950,ARGUMENT.,"to slay, until thou reach the well-benched ships, and the sun set, and"
7951,ARGUMENT.,sacred darkness come on.”
7952,ARGUMENT.,
7953,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having spoken, swift-footed Iris departed. But Hector with his"
7954,ARGUMENT.,"armour sprang from his chariot to the ground, and brandishing sharp"
7955,ARGUMENT.,"spears, ranged through the army on every side, inciting them to fight,"
7956,ARGUMENT.,"and stirred up the dreadful battle. They indeed rallied, and stood"
7957,ARGUMENT.,"opposite to the Greeks; but the Greeks, on the other hand, strengthened"
7958,ARGUMENT.,"their phalanxes. And the battle was renewed, and they stood front to"
7959,ARGUMENT.,"front. But Agamemnon first rushed on, for he wished to fight far before"
7960,ARGUMENT.,all.
7961,ARGUMENT.,
7962,ARGUMENT.,"Tell me now, ye muses, possessing Olympian dwellings, who first, either"
7963,ARGUMENT.,"of the Trojans or illustrious allies, now came against Agamemnon?"
7964,ARGUMENT.,"Iphidamas, son of Antenor, both valiant and great, who was nurtured in"
7965,ARGUMENT.,"fertile Thrace, the mother of flocks. Cisseus, his maternal"
7966,ARGUMENT.,"grandfather, who begat fair-cheeked Theano, reared him in his house"
7967,ARGUMENT.,whilst yet a little boy: but when he had attained the measure of
7968,ARGUMENT.,"glorious youth, he there detained him, and gave him his own daughter."
7969,ARGUMENT.,"And having married her, he came from the bridal chamber, on the rumour"
7970,ARGUMENT.,"of the Greeks, with twelve curved vessels which followed him. The equal"
7971,ARGUMENT.,"ships indeed he afterwards left at Percote, but he, proceeding on foot,"
7972,ARGUMENT.,"had arrived at Troy; and he it was who then came against Agamemnon, the"
7973,ARGUMENT.,"son of Atreus. When these, advancing against each other, were now near,"
7974,ARGUMENT.,"the son of Atreus on his part missed, and his spear was turned aside."
7975,ARGUMENT.,"But Iphidamas smote him upon the belt, under the corslet; and he put"
7976,ARGUMENT.,"his strength to it, relying on his strong hand. Yet he pierced not the"
7977,ARGUMENT.,"flexible belt, but meeting with the silver long before, the point was"
7978,ARGUMENT.,"turned like lead. Then indeed wide-ruling Agamemnon, seeing it in his"
7979,ARGUMENT.,"hand, pulled it towards him, exasperated, like a lion, and plucked it"
7980,ARGUMENT.,"from his hand; and he smote him on the neck with his sword, and relaxed"
7981,ARGUMENT.,"his limbs. Thus he, unhappy, while aiding his citizens, falling there,"
7982,ARGUMENT.,"slept a brazen sleep, away from his lawful virgin wife, whose charms he"
7983,ARGUMENT.,"had not yet known, although he had given many presents [for her]. 370"
7984,ARGUMENT.,"First he gave a hundred oxen, and then he promised a thousand goats and"
7985,ARGUMENT.,"sheep together, which were pastured for him in countless numbers. Him"
7986,ARGUMENT.,"Agamemnon, son of Atreus, at that time stripped [of his arms], and went"
7987,ARGUMENT.,"through the army of the Greeks, bearing his rich armour. Whom when"
7988,ARGUMENT.,"Coon, 371 the eldest born of Antenor, conspicuous amongst men, then"
7989,ARGUMENT.,"beheld, violent grief darkened his eyes, for his brother having fallen,"
7990,ARGUMENT.,"and he stood aside with his spear, escaping the notice of noble"
7991,ARGUMENT.,"Agamemnon. And he wounded him in the middle of the arm, below the"
7992,ARGUMENT.,"elbow, and the point of the shining spear passed right through to the"
7993,ARGUMENT.,"other side. Then indeed Agamemnon, the king of men, shuddered; but not"
7994,ARGUMENT.,"even thus did he abstain from battle or from war, but he rushed upon"
7995,ARGUMENT.,"Coon, holding his wind-nurtured spear. 372 He on his part was eagerly"
7996,ARGUMENT.,"dragging by the foot Iphidamas his brother, and begotten by the same"
7997,ARGUMENT.,"father, and was calling upon every brave man, when [Agamemnon] wounded"
7998,ARGUMENT.,"him with his polished brazen spear below the bossy shield, whilst"
7999,ARGUMENT.,"dragging him through the crowd, and relaxed his limbs; and, standing"
8000,ARGUMENT.,"beside him, cut off his head over Iphidamas. There the sons of Antenor,"
8001,ARGUMENT.,"fulfilling their destiny at the hands of the king, the son of Atreus,"
8002,ARGUMENT.,descended to the abode of Hades. But he was ranging about through the
8003,ARGUMENT.,"ranks of other men, with his spear, his sword, and huge stones, whilst"
8004,ARGUMENT.,"the warm blood yet oozed from his wound. When, however, the wound grew"
8005,ARGUMENT.,"dry, and the blood ceased [to flow], sharp pains possessed the strength"
8006,ARGUMENT.,"of Atreus’s son. And as when the sharp pang seizes a woman in travail,"
8007,ARGUMENT.,"piercing, which the Ilithyiæ, daughters of Juno, who preside over"
8008,ARGUMENT.,"childbirth, send forth, keeping bitter pangs in their possession; so"
8009,ARGUMENT.,did sharp anguish enter the strength of the son of Atreus. And he
8010,ARGUMENT.,"sprang into his chariot, and ordered his charioteer to drive on to the"
8011,ARGUMENT.,"hollow ships; for he was tortured at heart. And vociferating, he"
8012,ARGUMENT.,shouted aloud to the Greeks:
8013,ARGUMENT.,
8014,ARGUMENT.,"“O friends, leaders, and rulers over the Argives, repel ye now the"
8015,ARGUMENT.,"severe battle from the sea-traversing barks, since provident Jove does"
8016,ARGUMENT.,not permit me to combat all day with the Trojans.”

8028,ARGUMENT.,
8029,ARGUMENT.,Thus he spoke; and the charioteer lashed on the fair-maned steeds
8030,ARGUMENT.,"towards the hollow ships; and they, not unwilling, flew. They were"
8031,ARGUMENT.,"covered with foam as to their breasts, and were sprinkled beneath with"
8032,ARGUMENT.,"dust, as they bore the afflicted king apart from the battle. But"
8033,ARGUMENT.,"Hector, when he observed Agamemnon going apart, exhorted both the"
8034,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans and Lycians, shouting aloud:"
8035,ARGUMENT.,
8036,ARGUMENT.,"“Ye Trojans, Lycians, and close-fighting Dardanians, be men, my"
8037,ARGUMENT.,"friends, and be mindful of impetuous might. The bravest hero has"
8038,ARGUMENT.,"departed, and Saturnian Jove has given great glory to me. But"
8039,ARGUMENT.,"straightway urge your solid-hoofed horses against the gallant Greeks,"
8040,ARGUMENT.,that ye may bear off higher glory.”
8041,ARGUMENT.,
8042,ARGUMENT.,"Thus saying, he aroused the courage and spirit of each. As when"
8043,ARGUMENT.,perchance some huntsman should urge his white-toothed dogs against a
8044,ARGUMENT.,"rustic wild boar or lion; so Hector, the son of Priam, equal to"
8045,ARGUMENT.,"man-slaughtering Mars, urged the magnanimous Trojans against the"
8046,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks. He himself, having mighty courage, advanced among the first,"
8047,ARGUMENT.,"and rushed into the battle, like unto a storm blowing from above, and"
8048,ARGUMENT.,"which rushing down, stirs up the purple deep."
8049,ARGUMENT.,
8050,ARGUMENT.,"Then whom first and whom last, did Hector, son of Priam, slay, when"
8051,ARGUMENT.,"Jove gave him glory? Assæus indeed first, and Autonoüs, and Opites, and"
8052,ARGUMENT.,"Dolops, son of Clytis, and Opheltius, and Agelaus, and Æsymnus, and"
8053,ARGUMENT.,"Orus, and Hipponoüs, persevering in fight. These leaders of the Greeks"
8054,ARGUMENT.,"he then slew, and afterwards the common crowd; as when the west wind"
8055,ARGUMENT.,"drives to and fro the clouds of the impetuous 373 south, lashing them"
8056,ARGUMENT.,"with an impetuous blast, and many a swollen 374 billow is rolled along,"
8057,ARGUMENT.,whilst the foam is scattered on high by the far-straying blast of the
8058,ARGUMENT.,wind; thus were many heads of the people subdued by Hector. Then indeed
8059,ARGUMENT.,"would there have been ruin; and inevitable deeds had been done, and the"
8060,ARGUMENT.,"flying Greeks had fallen in flight into their ships, had not Ulysses"
8061,ARGUMENT.,"encouraged Diomede, the son of Tydeus:"
8062,ARGUMENT.,
8063,ARGUMENT.,"“Son of Tydeus, through what cause are we forgetful of impetuous might?"
8064,ARGUMENT.,"But come hither, my friend, stand by me; for surely it will be a"
8065,ARGUMENT.,disgrace if indeed crest-tossing Hector take the ships.”
8066,ARGUMENT.,
8067,ARGUMENT.,"Him then valiant Diomede, answering, addressed: “I indeed will remain,"
8068,ARGUMENT.,"and be courageous; although there will be little use 375 for us, since"
8069,ARGUMENT.,cloud-compelling Jove chooses to give glory to the Trojans rather than
8070,ARGUMENT.,to us.”

8079,ARGUMENT.,
8080,ARGUMENT.,"He said, and hurled Thymbræus from his chariot to the ground, striking"
8081,ARGUMENT.,"him with his spear upon the left pap; but Ulysses [slew] Molion, the"
8082,ARGUMENT.,"godlike attendant of the king. These then they left, since they caused"
8083,ARGUMENT.,"them to cease from war. Then both, advancing through the multitude,"
8084,ARGUMENT.,"excited confusion; as when two boars, full of courage, rush upon the"
8085,ARGUMENT.,"hounds; so they returning to the fight, cut down the Trojans; and the"
8086,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks joyfully gained a respite, avoiding noble Hector. Next they took"
8087,ARGUMENT.,"a chariot and two warriors, the bravest of the people, the two sons of"
8088,ARGUMENT.,"Percosian Merops, who above all was skilled in augury, nor would permit"
8089,ARGUMENT.,"his sons to march to the man-destroying war: yet did they not obey him,"
8090,ARGUMENT.,because the destinies of black death led them on. Them spear-renowned
8091,ARGUMENT.,"Diomede, the son of Tydeus, depriving of life and breath, despoiled of"
8092,ARGUMENT.,their splendid armour. And Ulysses slew Hippodamus and Hyperochus.
8093,ARGUMENT.,
8094,ARGUMENT.,"Then the son of Saturn, looking down from Ida, stretched for them the"
8095,ARGUMENT.,"contest with equal tension, and they slaughtered one another. The son"
8096,ARGUMENT.,"of Tydeus indeed wounded on the hip, with his spear, the hero"
8097,ARGUMENT.,"Agastrophus, son of Pæon; for his horses were not at hand for him to"
8098,ARGUMENT.,"take flight; but he had erred greatly in his mind, for his attendant"
8099,ARGUMENT.,"kept them apart, whilst he rushed on foot through the foremost"
8100,ARGUMENT.,"combatants, till he lost his life. But Hector quickly perceived it"
8101,ARGUMENT.,"along the ranks, and hastened towards them, shouting; and with him"
8102,ARGUMENT.,"followed the phalanxes of the Trojans. Diomede, brave in the din of"
8103,ARGUMENT.,"battle, beholding him, shuddered, and immediately addressed Ulysses,"
8104,ARGUMENT.,who was near:
8105,ARGUMENT.,
8106,ARGUMENT.,"“Towards us is this great destruction, dreadful Hector, now rolled. But"
8107,ARGUMENT.,"come, let us stand firm, and awaiting, repulse [him].”"
8108,ARGUMENT.,
8109,ARGUMENT.,"He said, and brandishing his long-shadowed spear, hurled it, and smote"
8110,ARGUMENT.,"him on the summit of the helmet on his head; nor, aiming did he miss."
8111,ARGUMENT.,"But brass wandered from brass, nor did it reach the white skin; for the"
8112,ARGUMENT.,"threefold oblong helmet stopped it, which Phœbus Apollo had given him."
8113,ARGUMENT.,"Hector hastily retired to a distance, and was mingled with the crowd."
8114,ARGUMENT.,"And he (Hector) falling upon his knee, remained so, and supported"
8115,ARGUMENT.,"himself with his strong hand against the earth, whilst dark night"
8116,ARGUMENT.,overshadowed his eyes. But whilst the son of Tydeus was following after
8117,ARGUMENT.,"the impulse of the spear far through the foremost combatants, where it"
8118,ARGUMENT.,"was fixed in the earth, Hector, in the meantime, breathed again, and"
8119,ARGUMENT.,"springing again into his chariot, drove into the crowd, and avoided"
8120,ARGUMENT.,"black death. And valiant Diomede, rushing upon him with his spear,"
8121,ARGUMENT.,addressed him:
8122,ARGUMENT.,
8123,ARGUMENT.,"“Dog, thou hast escaped indeed death at present, although destruction"
8124,ARGUMENT.,"approached near thee. Now again has Phœbus Apollo rescued thee, to whom"
8125,ARGUMENT.,"thou art wont to offer prayers, advancing into the clash of spears. But"
8126,ARGUMENT.,"I will assuredly make an end of thee, meeting thee again, if perchance"
8127,ARGUMENT.,"any one of the gods be an ally to me. Now, however, I will go against"
8128,ARGUMENT.,"others, whomsoever I can find.”"
8129,ARGUMENT.,
8130,ARGUMENT.,"He said, and slew the spear-renowned son of Pæon. But Paris, the"
8131,ARGUMENT.,"husband of fair-haired Helen, leaning against a pillar, at the tomb of"
8132,ARGUMENT.,"the deceased hero, Dardanian Ilus, the aged leader of the people, bent"
8133,ARGUMENT.,"his bow against the son of Tydeus, the shepherd of the people. Whilst"
8134,ARGUMENT.,he was removing the variegated corslet from the breast of gallant
8135,ARGUMENT.,"Agastrophus, the shield from his shoulders, and his heavy casque, he"
8136,ARGUMENT.,"(Paris) in the meantime was drawing back the horn of his bow, and"
8137,ARGUMENT.,"struck him on the broad part of the right foot, nor did the weapon"
8138,ARGUMENT.,escape in vain from his hand; and the arrow went entirely into the
8139,ARGUMENT.,"ground. And he, laughing very joyfully, sprang from his ambuscade, and"
8140,ARGUMENT.,"boasting, spoke:"
8141,ARGUMENT.,
8142,ARGUMENT.,"“Thou art struck, nor has the weapon escaped me in vain. Would that,"
8143,ARGUMENT.,"striking thee in the lower part of the groin, I had deprived thee of"
8144,ARGUMENT.,"life. Thus, indeed, would the Trojans have respired from destruction,"
8145,ARGUMENT.,"who now are thrilled with horror at thee, as bleating goats at the"
8146,ARGUMENT.,lion.”
8147,ARGUMENT.,
8148,ARGUMENT.,"But him valiant Diomede, undismayed, addressed:"
8149,ARGUMENT.,
8150,ARGUMENT.,"“Archer, reviler, decked out with curls, woman’s man, if now in arms"
8151,ARGUMENT.,"thou wouldst make trial of me, hand to hand, thy bow should not avail"
8152,ARGUMENT.,"thee, and numerous arrows 376 whereas now, having grazed the broad part"
8153,ARGUMENT.,"of my foot, thou boastest thus. I regard it not, as though a woman had"
8154,ARGUMENT.,"wounded me, or a silly boy: for idle is the weapon of an unwarlike,"
8155,ARGUMENT.,"good-for-nothing man. From me, indeed, it is otherwise; for if one be"
8156,ARGUMENT.,"touched but slightly, the weapon is piercing, and forthwith renders him"
8157,ARGUMENT.,"lifeless; and the cheeks of his wife are furrowed on both sides, and"
8158,ARGUMENT.,"his children are orphans; but crimsoning the earth with his blood, he"
8159,ARGUMENT.,"putrefies, and the birds around him are more numerous than the women.”"
8160,ARGUMENT.,
8161,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 376: (return)  Cf. iii. 39, sqq.; Hor. Od. i. 15, 13."
8162,ARGUMENT.,
8163,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but spear-renowned Ulysses coming near, stood before"
8164,ARGUMENT.,"him, and he (Diomede) sitting down behind him, drew the swift shaft out"
8165,ARGUMENT.,"of his foot, and severe agony darted through his body. Then he leaped"
8166,ARGUMENT.,"into his chariot, and commanded his charioteer to drive to the hollow"
8167,ARGUMENT.,ships; for he was grieved at heart. But spear-renowned Ulysses was left
8168,ARGUMENT.,"alone, nor did any of the Greeks remain beside him, as fear had seized"
8169,ARGUMENT.,"upon all. Wherefore, groaning inwardly, he addressed his own mighty"
8170,ARGUMENT.,soul:
8171,ARGUMENT.,
8172,ARGUMENT.,"“Alas! what will become of me? Great would be the disgrace if I fly,"
8173,ARGUMENT.,alarmed at the multitude; but worse would it be if I were taken alone:
8174,ARGUMENT.,but the son of Saturn hath struck the rest of the Greeks with terror.
8175,ARGUMENT.,But wherefore does my spirit discuss these things with me? for I know
8176,ARGUMENT.,that cowards indeed retire from the battle; but whosoever should be
8177,ARGUMENT.,"brave in combat, it is altogether necessary that he stand firmly,"
8178,ARGUMENT.,"whether he be wounded, or wound another.”"
8179,ARGUMENT.,
8180,ARGUMENT.,"Whilst he revolved these things within his mind and soul, the ranks of"
8181,ARGUMENT.,"the shielded Trojans in the meantime came upon him, and enclosed him in"
8182,ARGUMENT.,"the midst, placing [their] bane in the midst of them. As when dogs and"
8183,ARGUMENT.,"vigorous youths rush against a boar on all sides, but he comes out from"
8184,ARGUMENT.,"a deep thicket, sharpening his white tusk within his crooked jaws; on"
8185,ARGUMENT.,"all sides they rush upon him, and a gnashing of teeth arises: but they"
8186,ARGUMENT.,"remain at a distance from him, terrible as he is: so the Trojans did"
8187,ARGUMENT.,"rush round Ulysses, dear to Jove. But he wounded above the shoulder"
8188,ARGUMENT.,"blameless Deïopites, springing upon him with his sharp spear; and"
8189,ARGUMENT.,afterwards he slew Thoön and Ennomous. With his spear he next wounded
8190,ARGUMENT.,"Chersidamas, when leaping from his chariot, in the navel, below his"
8191,ARGUMENT.,"bossed shield; but he, falling amid the dust, grasped the earth with"
8192,ARGUMENT.,"the hollow of his hand. These indeed he left, and next wounded with his"
8193,ARGUMENT.,"spear Charops, son of Hippasus, and brother of noble Socus. But Socus,"
8194,ARGUMENT.,"godlike hero, hastened to give him aid; and approaching very near, he"
8195,ARGUMENT.,"stood, and addressed him in these words:"
8196,ARGUMENT.,
8197,ARGUMENT.,"“O illustrious Ulysses, insatiable in crafts and toil, to-day shalt"
8198,ARGUMENT.,"thou either boast over the two sons of Hippasus, having slain such"
8199,ARGUMENT.,"heroes, and stripped them of their arms, or else stricken by my spear,"
8200,ARGUMENT.,thou shalt lose thy life.”
8201,ARGUMENT.,
8202,ARGUMENT.,"Thus saying, he smote him upon the shield equal on all sides. The rapid"
8203,ARGUMENT.,"weapon penetrated the shining shield, and was fixed through the"
8204,ARGUMENT.,"curiously-wrought corslet, and tore off all the skin from his sides."
8205,ARGUMENT.,But Pallas Minerva suffered it not to be mingled with the entrails of
8206,ARGUMENT.,the hero. And Ulysses perceived that the weapon had not come upon him
8207,ARGUMENT.,"mortally, and retiring, he addressed [this] speech to Socus:"
8208,ARGUMENT.,
8209,ARGUMENT.,“Ah! wretch; very soon indeed will dreadful destruction overtake thee.
8210,ARGUMENT.,Without doubt thou hast caused me to cease from fighting with the
8211,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans, but I declare that death and black fate shall be thine this"
8212,ARGUMENT.,"day; and that, subdued beneath my spear, thou shalt give glory to me,"
8213,ARGUMENT.,and thy soul to steed-famed Pluto.” 377
8214,ARGUMENT.,
8215,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 377: (return)  Probably so called from the steeds (“inferni
8216,ARGUMENT.,"raptoris equos,” Claud. de Rapt. Pros. i. 1) by which he stole away"
8217,ARGUMENT.,Proserpine. See the Scholiast.
8218,ARGUMENT.,
8219,ARGUMENT.,"He said, and the other, turning again to flight, had begun to retreat,"
8220,ARGUMENT.,"but whilst he was turning, he (Ulysses) fixed his spear in his back"
8221,ARGUMENT.,"between the shoulders, and drove it through his breast. Falling, he"
8222,ARGUMENT.,"made a crash, and noble Ulysses boasted over him:"
8223,ARGUMENT.,
8224,ARGUMENT.,"“O Socus, son of warlike, horse-breaking Hippasus, the end of death has"
8225,ARGUMENT.,"anticipated thee, nor hast thou escaped. Ah! wretch, neither thy father"
8226,ARGUMENT.,"nor venerable mother shall close thine eyes for thee, dead as thou art,"
8227,ARGUMENT.,"but ravenous birds shall tear thee, flapping about thee with dense"
8228,ARGUMENT.,"wings: but when I die, the noble Greeks will pay me funeral honours.”"
8229,ARGUMENT.,
8230,ARGUMENT.,"So saying, he plucked the strong spear of warlike Socus out of his"
8231,ARGUMENT.,"flesh and bossy shield; and his blood gushed forth as he drew it out,"
8232,ARGUMENT.,"and tortured his mind. But the magnanimous Trojans, when they beheld"
8233,ARGUMENT.,"the blood of Ulysses, encouraging one another through the crowd, all"
8234,ARGUMENT.,"rushed on against him; whilst he kept retreating backwards, and called"
8235,ARGUMENT.,to his companions. Thrice did he then shout as much as the head of
8236,ARGUMENT.,"mortal could contain, and thrice warlike Menelaus heard him exclaiming,"
8237,ARGUMENT.,"and instantly addressed Ajax, being near:"
8238,ARGUMENT.,
8239,ARGUMENT.,"“Most noble Ajax, son of Telamon, chieftain of the people, the cry of"
8240,ARGUMENT.,"invincible Ulysses has come upon me, like to that, as if the Trojans"
8241,ARGUMENT.,"were greatly pressing upon him, being alone, having cut him off in the"
8242,ARGUMENT.,"sharp fight. Wherefore let us go through the crowd, as it is better to"
8243,ARGUMENT.,"aid him. I fear lest being left alone amidst the Trojans, he suffer"
8244,ARGUMENT.,"aught, although being brave, and there be great want [of him] to the"
8245,ARGUMENT.,Greeks.”
8246,ARGUMENT.,
8247,ARGUMENT.,"Thus speaking, he led the way, and the godlike hero followed along with"
8248,ARGUMENT.,"him. Then they found Ulysses, dear to Jove; and around him followed the"
8249,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans, like tawny jackals round an antlered stag when wounded in the"
8250,ARGUMENT.,"mountains, which a man hath stricken with an arrow from the bowstring."
8251,ARGUMENT.,"Him indeed, flying, it escapes on its feet, as long as the blood is"
8252,ARGUMENT.,"warm, and its knees have the power of motion. But when the swift arrow"
8253,ARGUMENT.,"hath subdued it, the raw-devouring jackals destroy it in a shady grove"
8254,ARGUMENT.,"among the mountains. Chance, however, brings thither the destructive"
8255,ARGUMENT.,"lion: the jackals then fly in terror, and he devours. So at that time"
8256,ARGUMENT.,"followed the Trojans, numerous and brave, round warlike, crafty"
8257,ARGUMENT.,"Ulysses; but the hero, rushing on with his spear, warded off the"
8258,ARGUMENT.,"merciless day. Then Ajax came near, bearing his shield, like a tower,"
8259,ARGUMENT.,"and stood beside him; and the Trojans fled, terrified, different ways."
8260,ARGUMENT.,"In the meantime warlike Menelaus, taking him by the hand, withdrew"
8261,ARGUMENT.,"[him] from the throng, till his attendant drove his horses near. But"
8262,ARGUMENT.,"Ajax, springing upon the Trojans, slew Doryclus, son of Priam, an"
8263,ARGUMENT.,"illegitimate son; and next wounded Pandocus. Lysander he wounded, and"
8264,ARGUMENT.,"Pyrasus, and Pylartes. And as when an overflowing river comes down on"
8265,ARGUMENT.,"the plain, a torrent from the mountains, accompanied by the shower of"
8266,ARGUMENT.,"Jove, and bears along with it many dry oaks and many pines, and casts"
8267,ARGUMENT.,"forth the swollen torrent into the sea; so illustrious Ajax, routing"
8268,ARGUMENT.,"[them], pursued [them] along the plain, slaughtering both horses and"
8269,ARGUMENT.,men. Nor as yet had Hector heard it; for he was fighting on the left of
8270,ARGUMENT.,"the battle, on the banks of the river Scamander; for there chiefly fell"
8271,ARGUMENT.,"the heads of men, and an inextinguishable clamour had arisen around"
8272,ARGUMENT.,"mighty Nestor, and warlike Idomeneus. Among these did Hector mingle,"
8273,ARGUMENT.,"performing arduous deeds with his spear and equestrian skill, and he"
8274,ARGUMENT.,was laying waste the phalanxes of youths. Nevertheless the noble Greeks
8275,ARGUMENT.,"would not have retired from the way, had not Paris, the husband of"
8276,ARGUMENT.,"fair-haired Helen, disabled Machaon, the shepherd of the people,"
8277,ARGUMENT.,"performing prodigies of valour, wounding him on the right shoulder with"
8278,ARGUMENT.,a triple-barbed arrow. For him then the valour-breathing Greeks
8279,ARGUMENT.,"trembled, lest perchance they should slay him, the battle giving way,"
8280,ARGUMENT.,and immediately Idomeneus addressed noble Nestor:
8281,ARGUMENT.,
8282,ARGUMENT.,"“O Neleian Nestor, great glory of the Greeks, come, ascend thy chariot,"
8283,ARGUMENT.,and let Machaon mount beside thee; and direct thy solid-hoofed horses
8284,ARGUMENT.,"with all speed towards the ships, for a medical man is equivalent to"
8285,ARGUMENT.,"many others, both to cut out arrows, and to apply mild remedies.” 378"
8286,ARGUMENT.,
8287,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 378: (return)  Scribonius Largus, Compos. Med. cc. “Neque"

8290,ARGUMENT.,"ab aliis adjuvantur, et quasi consumantur.” Where John Rhodius well"
8291,ARGUMENT.,observes: “Antiquos chirurgos Homerus Chironis exemplo herbarum succis

8295,ARGUMENT.,the chirurgical part of ancient medicine is amusingly discussed.
8296,ARGUMENT.,
8297,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke, nor did the Gerenian knight Nestor disobey. Forthwith he"
8298,ARGUMENT.,"ascended his chariot, and Machaon, the son of Æsculapius, blameless"
8299,ARGUMENT.,"physician, mounted beside him; but he lashed on the steeds, and they"
8300,ARGUMENT.,"flew not unwillingly towards the hollow ships, for there it was"
8301,ARGUMENT.,agreeable to their inclination [to go].
8302,ARGUMENT.,
8303,ARGUMENT.,"But Cebriones, sitting beside Hector, perceived the Trojans in"
8304,ARGUMENT.,"confusion, and addressed him in [these] words: “Hector, we two are"
8305,ARGUMENT.,"mingling here with the Greeks in the outskirt of evil-sounding battle,"
8306,ARGUMENT.,"whilst the other Trojans are thrown into confusion in crowds, both"
8307,ARGUMENT.,"their horses and themselves. Telamonian Ajax is routing them, for I"
8308,ARGUMENT.,"know him well, for around his shoulders he bears a broad shield. But"
8309,ARGUMENT.,"let us also direct our horses and chariot thither, where cavalry and"
8310,ARGUMENT.,"infantry, having engaged in the evil strife, are slaughtering each"
8311,ARGUMENT.,"other, and inextinguishable tumult hath arisen.”"
8312,ARGUMENT.,
8313,ARGUMENT.,"Thus then having spoken, he lashed on the fair-maned steeds with his"
8314,ARGUMENT.,"shrill-cracking lash. But they, sensible of the stroke, speedily bore"
8315,ARGUMENT.,"the swift chariot through Trojans and Greeks, trampling on both corses"
8316,ARGUMENT.,"and shields. With blood the whole axletree was stained beneath, and the"
8317,ARGUMENT.,"rims around the chariot-seat, which the drops from the horses’ hoofs,"
8318,ARGUMENT.,"and from the wheel-tires, spattered. But he longed to enter the crowd"
8319,ARGUMENT.,"of heroes, and to break through, springing upon them. And he sent"
8320,ARGUMENT.,"destructive tumult upon the Greeks, and abstained very little from the"
8321,ARGUMENT.,"spear. Among the ranks of other men indeed he ranged with his spear,"
8322,ARGUMENT.,"his sword, and with huge stones; but he shunned the conflict of"
8323,ARGUMENT.,Telamonian Ajax.
8324,ARGUMENT.,
8325,ARGUMENT.,"But lofty-throned Jove excited fear within Ajax, and he stood"
8326,ARGUMENT.,"confounded, and cast behind him his shield of seven bulls’ hides."
8327,ARGUMENT.,"Panic-struck he retired, gazing on all sides like a wild beast, turning"
8328,ARGUMENT.,"to and fro, slowly moving knee after knee. As when dogs and rustic men"
8329,ARGUMENT.,"drive a ravening lion from the stall of oxen, who, keeping watch all"
8330,ARGUMENT.,"night, do not allow him to carry off the fat of their cattle, but he,"
8331,ARGUMENT.,"eager for their flesh, rushes on, but profits nought, for numerous"
8332,ARGUMENT.,"javelins fly against him from daring hands, and blazing torches, at"
8333,ARGUMENT.,"which he trembles, although furious; but in the morning he stalks away"
8334,ARGUMENT.,"with saddened mind: so Ajax, sad at heart, then retired, much against"
8335,ARGUMENT.,"his will, from the Trojans; for he feared for the ships of the Greeks."
8336,ARGUMENT.,"And as when a stubborn ass, upon whose sides 379 many sticks have"
8337,ARGUMENT.,"already been broken, entering in, browses on the tall crop, but the"
8338,ARGUMENT.,"boys still beat him with sticks, although their strength is but feeble,"
8339,ARGUMENT.,"and with difficulty drive him out, when he is satiated with food, so"
8340,ARGUMENT.,then at length the magnanimous Trojans and far-summoned allies
8341,ARGUMENT.,"continually followed Ajax, the mighty son of Telamon, striking the"
8342,ARGUMENT.,"middle of his shield with missile weapons. And Ajax, sometimes wheeling"
8343,ARGUMENT.,"about, was mindful of impetuous might, and checked the phalanxes of the"
8344,ARGUMENT.,"horse-breaking Trojans, but again he would turn himself to fly. But he"
8345,ARGUMENT.,"prevented all from advancing to the swift ships, whilst standing"
8346,ARGUMENT.,himself between the Trojans and Greeks he raged impetuously. And spears
8347,ARGUMENT.,"hurled against him from daring hands, stuck, some indeed in his ample"
8348,ARGUMENT.,"shield, and many, though eager to glut themselves with his flesh, stood"

8353,ARGUMENT.,"Whom when Eurypylus, the illustrious son of Evæmon, perceived pressed"
8354,ARGUMENT.,"hard with many darts, advancing he stood beside him, and took aim with"
8355,ARGUMENT.,"his shining spear; and smote Apisaon, son of Phausias, shepherd of the"
8356,ARGUMENT.,"people, in the liver, under the diaphragm; and immediately relaxed his"
8357,ARGUMENT.,limbs. And when godlike Alexander observed him stripping off the armour
8358,ARGUMENT.,"of Apisaon, he instantly bent his bow against Eurypylus, and smote him"
8359,ARGUMENT.,"with an arrow upon the right thigh; and the reed was broken, and pained"
8360,ARGUMENT.,"his thigh. Then he fell back into the column of his companions,"
8361,ARGUMENT.,"avoiding fate, and shouting, he cried with a loud voice to the Greeks:"
8362,ARGUMENT.,
8363,ARGUMENT.,"“O friends, leaders, and rulers over the Greeks, rallying, stand firm,"
8364,ARGUMENT.,"and ward off the merciless day from Ajax, who is hard pressed with"
8365,ARGUMENT.,darts; nor do I think that he will escape from the dread-resounding
8366,ARGUMENT.,"battle. But by all means stand firm round mighty Ajax, the son of"
8367,ARGUMENT.,Telamon.”
8368,ARGUMENT.,
8369,ARGUMENT.,"So spake the wounded Eurypylus, and they stood very near him, resting"
8370,ARGUMENT.,"their shields upon their shoulders, and lifting up their spears. But"
8371,ARGUMENT.,"Ajax came to meet them, and turning about, stood firm, when he reached"
8372,ARGUMENT.,the body of his comrades. Thus they indeed combated like blazing fire.
8373,ARGUMENT.,
8374,ARGUMENT.,"In the meantime the Neleian steeds, sweating, bore Nestor from the"
8375,ARGUMENT.,"battle, and conveyed Machaon, the shepherd of the people. And noble"
8376,ARGUMENT.,"Achilles, swift of foot, looking forth, beheld him; for he stood upon"
8377,ARGUMENT.,"the prow of his great ship, gazing at the severe labour and lamentable"
8378,ARGUMENT.,"rout. Straightway he addressed Patroclus, his companion, calling [to"
8379,ARGUMENT.,"him] from the ship; and he, hearing him within the tent, came forth,"
8380,ARGUMENT.,like unto Mars: but it was the beginning of misfortune to him. Him
8381,ARGUMENT.,"first the gallant son of Menœtius addressed: “Why dost thou call me,"
8382,ARGUMENT.,"Achilles, and what need hast thou of me?”"
8383,ARGUMENT.,
8384,ARGUMENT.,"But him swift-footed Achilles answering, addressed: “Noble son of"
8385,ARGUMENT.,"Menœtius, most dear to my soul, soon I think that the Greeks will stand"
8386,ARGUMENT.,"round my knees entreating, for a necessity no longer tolerable invades"
8387,ARGUMENT.,"them. But go now, Patroclus, dear to Jove, ask Nestor what man this is"
8388,ARGUMENT.,"whom he is carrying wounded from the battle. Behind, indeed, he wholly"
8389,ARGUMENT.,"resembles Machaon, the son of Æsculapius, but I have not beheld the"
8390,ARGUMENT.,"countenance of the man: for the horses passed by me, hastening onward.”"
8391,ARGUMENT.,
8392,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke, and Patroclus was obedient to his dear comrade, and"
8393,ARGUMENT.,hastened to run to the tents and ships of the Greeks.
8394,ARGUMENT.,
8395,ARGUMENT.,"But when they came to the tent of the son of Neleus, they themselves"
8396,ARGUMENT.,"descended to the fertile earth, and Eurymedon, the attendant of the old"
8397,ARGUMENT.,"man, unyoked the mares from the chariot; whilst they refreshed"
8398,ARGUMENT.,"themselves from the sweat upon their tunics, 380 standing towards the"
8399,ARGUMENT.,"breeze beside the shore of the sea, and afterwards, entering the tent,"
8400,ARGUMENT.,they sat down upon couches. But for them fair-curled Hecamede prepared
8401,ARGUMENT.,"a mixture, she whom the old man had brought from Tenedos, when Achilles"
8402,ARGUMENT.,"laid it waste, the daughter of magnanimous Arsinoüs, whom the Greeks"
8403,ARGUMENT.,"selected for him, because he surpassed all in counsel. First she set"
8404,ARGUMENT.,"forward for them a handsome, cyanus-footed, well-polished table; then"
8405,ARGUMENT.,"upon it a brazen tray, and on it an onion, a relish 381 for the"
8406,ARGUMENT.,"draught, as well as new honey, and beside it the fruit of sacred corn."
8407,ARGUMENT.,"Likewise a splendid cup 382 near them, which the old man had brought"
8408,ARGUMENT.,"from home, studded with golden nails. Its handles were four, and around"
8409,ARGUMENT.,"each were two golden pigeons feeding, and under it were two bottoms."
8410,ARGUMENT.,"Another indeed would have removed it with difficulty from the table,"
8411,ARGUMENT.,being full; but aged Nestor raised it without difficulty. In it the
8412,ARGUMENT.,"woman, like unto the goddesses, had mixed for them Pramnian wine, and"
8413,ARGUMENT.,"grated over it a goat’s-milk cheese with a brazen rasp, and sprinkled"
8414,ARGUMENT.,"white flour upon it: then bade them drink, as soon as she had prepared"
8415,ARGUMENT.,"the potion. But when drinking they had removed parching thirst, they"
8416,ARGUMENT.,"amused themselves, addressing each other in conversation. And Patroclus"
8417,ARGUMENT.,"stood at the doors, a godlike hero."

8434,ARGUMENT.,
8435,ARGUMENT.,"“No seat [for me], O Jove-nurtured sage, nor wilt thou persuade me."
8436,ARGUMENT.,Revered and irascible 383 is he who sent me forth to inquire who this
8437,ARGUMENT.,"man is whom thou leadest wounded; but even I myself know, for I"
8438,ARGUMENT.,"perceive Machaon, the shepherd of the people. Now, however, in order to"
8439,ARGUMENT.,"deliver my message, I will return again an ambassador to Achilles; for"
8440,ARGUMENT.,"well dost thou know, O Jove-nurtured sage, what a terrible man he is;"
8441,ARGUMENT.,soon would he blame even the blameless.”

8445,ARGUMENT.,
8446,ARGUMENT.,But him the Gerenian knight Nestor then answered: “But why indeed does
8447,ARGUMENT.,"Achilles thus compassionate the sons of the Greeks, as many as have"
8448,ARGUMENT.,been wounded with weapons? Nor knows he how great sorrow hath arisen
8449,ARGUMENT.,"throughout the army; for the bravest lie in the ships, smitten in the"
8450,ARGUMENT.,"distant or the close fight. 384 Stricken is brave Diomede, the son of"
8451,ARGUMENT.,"Tydeus, and wounded is spear-renowned Ulysses, as well as Agamemnon."
8452,ARGUMENT.,Eurypylus also has been wounded in the thigh with an arrow; and this
8453,ARGUMENT.,"other have I lately brought from battle, smitten with an arrow from the"
8454,ARGUMENT.,"bowstring: yet Achilles, being brave, regards not the Greeks, nor"
8455,ARGUMENT.,"pities them. Does he wait until the swift ships near the sea, contrary"
8456,ARGUMENT.,"to the will of the Greeks, be consumed with the hostile fire, and we"
8457,ARGUMENT.,ourselves be slain one after the other? For my strength is not as it
8458,ARGUMENT.,"formerly was in my active members. Would that I were thus young, and my"
8459,ARGUMENT.,"might was firm, as when a contest took place between the Eleans and us,"
8460,ARGUMENT.,"about the driving away some oxen, when, driving away in reprisal, I"
8461,ARGUMENT.,"slew Itymoneus, the valiant son of Hypeirochus, who dwelt in Elis: for"
8462,ARGUMENT.,"he, defending his cattle, was smitten among the first by a javelin from"
8463,ARGUMENT.,"my hand, and there fell; and his rustic troops fled on every side. And"
8464,ARGUMENT.,"we drove from the plain a very great booty, fifty droves of oxen, as"
8465,ARGUMENT.,"many flocks of sheep, as many herds of swine, and as many broad herds"
8466,ARGUMENT.,"of goats, one hundred and fifty yellow steeds, all mares, and beneath"
8467,ARGUMENT.,"many there were colts. And these we drove within Neleian Pylus, at"
8468,ARGUMENT.,"night towards the city; but Neleus was delighted in his mind, because"
8469,ARGUMENT.,"many things had fallen to my lot, going as a young man to the war. But"
8470,ARGUMENT.,"with the appearing morn, heralds cried aloud for those to approach to"
8471,ARGUMENT.,whom a debt was due in rich Elis; and the leading heroes of the Pylians
8472,ARGUMENT.,"assembling, divided [the spoil], (because the Epeans owed a debt to"
8473,ARGUMENT.,"many); for we in Pylus, [being] few, were overwhelmed with evil. For"
8474,ARGUMENT.,"the Herculean might, coming in former years, did us mischief, and as"
8475,ARGUMENT.,"many as were bravest were slain. For we, the sons of illustrious"
8476,ARGUMENT.,"Neleus, were twelve; of whom I alone am left, but all the rest have"
8477,ARGUMENT.,"perished. Elated at these things, the brazen-mailed Epeans, insulting"
8478,ARGUMENT.,"us, devised wicked deeds. But the old man chose for himself a herd of"
8479,ARGUMENT.,"cattle and a large flock of sheep, selecting three hundred and their"
8480,ARGUMENT.,shepherds; for even to him a great debt was due in rich Elis: four
8481,ARGUMENT.,"horses, victorious in the race, with their chariots, which had gone for"
8482,ARGUMENT.,"the prizes; for they were about to run for a tripod; but Augeas, king"
8483,ARGUMENT.,"of men, detained them there, and dismissed the charioteer, grieved on"
8484,ARGUMENT.,"account of his steeds. At which words and deeds the old man, being"
8485,ARGUMENT.,"wroth, chose out for himself mighty numbers, and gave the rest to the"
8486,ARGUMENT.,"people to divide, that no one might go away defrauded by him of his"
8487,ARGUMENT.,"just proportion. We indeed accomplished each of these things, and were"
8488,ARGUMENT.,"performing sacrifices to the gods through the city, when on the third"
8489,ARGUMENT.,"day they all came at once, both the citizens themselves and their"
8490,ARGUMENT.,"solid-hoofed steeds, in full force: and with them were armed the two"
8491,ARGUMENT.,"Molions, being still youths, nor as yet very skilled in impetuous"
8492,ARGUMENT.,"might. There is a certain city, a lofty hill, Thryoëssa, far away at"
8493,ARGUMENT.,"the Alpheus, the last of sandy Pylus; this they invested, eager to"
8494,ARGUMENT.,"overthrow it. But when they had crossed the whole plain, Minerva,"
8495,ARGUMENT.,"hastening from Olympus, came to us by night as a messenger, that we"
8496,ARGUMENT.,"should be armed; nor did she assemble an unwilling people at Pylus, but"
8497,ARGUMENT.,"one very eager to fight. Still Neieus would not allow me to be armed,"
8498,ARGUMENT.,"but concealed my horses, for he said that I was not at all acquainted"
8499,ARGUMENT.,with warlike deeds. Yet even thus was I conspicuous amongst our
8500,ARGUMENT.,"cavalry, even although being on foot; for thus did Minerva conduct me"
8501,ARGUMENT.,"to battle. There is a certain river, Minyeïus, emptying itself into the"
8502,ARGUMENT.,"sea near Arena, where we, the Pylian horsemen, awaited divine Morn,"
8503,ARGUMENT.,"whilst the swarms of infantry poured in. Thence in full force, equipped"
8504,ARGUMENT.,"in armour, we came at mid-day to the sacred stream of Alpheus. There"
8505,ARGUMENT.,"having offered fair victims to almighty Jove, a bull to the Alpheus,"
8506,ARGUMENT.,"and a bull to Neptune, but an untrained heifer to blue-eyed Minerva, we"
8507,ARGUMENT.,then took supper through the army by troops; and we each slept in our
8508,ARGUMENT.,arms along the river’s stream. In the meantime the magnanimous Epeans
8509,ARGUMENT.,"stood around, desirous to lay waste the city; but a mighty work of Mars"
8510,ARGUMENT.,first appeared to them: for as soon as the splendid sun was elevated
8511,ARGUMENT.,"above the earth, we were engaged in the battle, praying to Jove and to"
8512,ARGUMENT.,"Minerva. But when now the battle of the Pylians and Eleans began, I"
8513,ARGUMENT.,"first slew a man, the warrior Molion, and bore away his solid-hoofed"
8514,ARGUMENT.,"steeds: he was the son-in-law of Augeas, and possessed his eldest"
8515,ARGUMENT.,"daughter, yellow-haired Agamede, who well understood as many drugs as"
8516,ARGUMENT.,"the wide earth nourishes. Him advancing against [me], I smote with my"
8517,ARGUMENT.,"brazen spear. He fell in the dust, and springing into his chariot, I"
8518,ARGUMENT.,then stood among the foremost combatants; but the magnanimous Epeans
8519,ARGUMENT.,fled terrified in different directions when they beheld the hero
8520,ARGUMENT.,"fallen, the leader of their cavalry, he who was the best to fight. But"
8521,ARGUMENT.,I rushed upon them like unto a black whirlwind; and I took fifty
8522,ARGUMENT.,"chariots, and in each two men bit the ground with their teeth,"
8523,ARGUMENT.,vanquished by my spear. And now indeed I should have slain the youthful
8524,ARGUMENT.,"Molions, the sons 385 of Actor, had not their sire, wide-ruling"
8525,ARGUMENT.,"Neptune, covering them with a thick haze, preserved them from the war."
8526,ARGUMENT.,"Then Jove delivered into the hands of the Pylians great strength, for"
8527,ARGUMENT.,"so long did we follow them through the long 386 plain, both slaying"
8528,ARGUMENT.,"them, and gathering up rich armour, until he had driven our horses to"
8529,ARGUMENT.,"Buprasium, fertile in wheat, to the rock Olenia and Alesium, where it"
8530,ARGUMENT.,is called Colone: whence Minerva turned back the people. Then having
8531,ARGUMENT.,"killed the last man, I left him; but the Greeks guided back their swift"
8532,ARGUMENT.,"steeds from Buprasium to Pylus; and all gave glory to Jove, of the"
8533,ARGUMENT.,"gods, and to Nestor, of men. Thus was I, as sure as ever I existed,"
8534,ARGUMENT.,among men: but Achilles will enjoy his valour alone: surely I think
8535,ARGUMENT.,"that he will hereafter greatly lament, when the people have bitterly"
8536,ARGUMENT.,"perished. O my friend, Menœtius did assuredly thus command thee on that"
8537,ARGUMENT.,day when he sent thee from Phthia to Agamemnon. For we being both
8538,ARGUMENT.,"within, I and noble Ulysses, distinctly heard all things in the halls,"
8539,ARGUMENT.,as he charged you: but we were come to the well-inhabited palace of
8540,ARGUMENT.,"Peleus, collecting an army through fertile Greece. There then we found"
8541,ARGUMENT.,"the hero Menœtius within, as well as thee, and Achilles besides; but"
8542,ARGUMENT.,"the aged horseman, Peleus, was burning the fat thighs of an ox to"
8543,ARGUMENT.,"thunder-rejoicing Jove, within the enclosure 387 of his palace, and"
8544,ARGUMENT.,"held a golden cup, pouring the dark wine over the blazing sacrifice."
8545,ARGUMENT.,"Both of you were then employed about the flesh of the ox, whilst we"
8546,ARGUMENT.,"stood in the vestibule; but Achilles, astonished, leaped up, and led us"
8547,ARGUMENT.,"in, taking us by the hand, and bade us be seated: and he set in order"
8548,ARGUMENT.,before us the offerings of hospitality which are proper for guests. But
8549,ARGUMENT.,"when we were satiated with eating and drinking, I began discourse,"
8550,ARGUMENT.,"exhorting you to follow along with us. Ye were both very willing, and"
8551,ARGUMENT.,they both commanded you many things. Aged Peleus in the first place
8552,ARGUMENT.,"directed his son Achilles ever to be the bravest, and to be conspicuous"
8553,ARGUMENT.,"above others; but to thee again Menœtius, the son of Actor, thus gave"
8554,ARGUMENT.,"charge: ‘My son, Achilles indeed is superior in birth; but thou art the"
8555,ARGUMENT.,elder. And he is much superior in strength: but still do thou
8556,ARGUMENT.,"frequently suggest to him proper advice, and admonish and direct him,"
8557,ARGUMENT.,and he will surely be obedient in what is for [his own] good.’ Thus did
8558,ARGUMENT.,the old man command thee; but thou art forgetful: but even now do thou
8559,ARGUMENT.,"mention these things to warlike Achilles, if perchance he may be"
8560,ARGUMENT.,"obedient. Who knows if, advising him, thou mayest, with the gods’"
8561,ARGUMENT.,"assistance, arouse his mind? For the admonition of a friend is good."
8562,ARGUMENT.,"But if within his mind he avoid some prophecy, and his venerable mother"
8563,ARGUMENT.,"has told him anything from Jove, let him at least send thee forth; and"
8564,ARGUMENT.,"with thee let the other forces of the Myrmidons follow, if indeed thou"
8565,ARGUMENT.,mayest be some aid to the Greeks. Let him likewise give his beautiful
8566,ARGUMENT.,"armour to thee, to be borne into battle, if perchance the Trojans,"
8567,ARGUMENT.,"assimilating thee to him, may abstain from the conflict, and the"
8568,ARGUMENT.,"warlike sons of the Greeks, already afflicted, may respire; and there"
8569,ARGUMENT.,"be a little respite from fighting. 388 But you, [who are] fresh, will,"
8570,ARGUMENT.,"with fighting, easily drive back men wearied, towards the city, from"
8571,ARGUMENT.,the ships and tents.”

8599,ARGUMENT.,"Down his back ran the copious sweat from his shoulders and head, and"
8600,ARGUMENT.,from the grievous wound oozed the black blood; nevertheless his mind
8601,ARGUMENT.,"was firm. Seeing him, the gallant son of Menœtius pitied him, and,"
8602,ARGUMENT.,"grieving, spoke winged words:"
8603,ARGUMENT.,
8604,ARGUMENT.,"“Alas! unhappy men, leaders and rulers over the Greeks, are ye then"
8605,ARGUMENT.,"thus destined, far away from your friends and native land, to satiate"

8607,ARGUMENT.,"Jove-nurtured hero, Eurypylus, will the Greeks still at all sustain"
8608,ARGUMENT.,"mighty Hector, or will they now be destroyed, subdued by his spear?”"
8609,ARGUMENT.,
8610,ARGUMENT.,"But him prudent Eurypylus in turn addressed: “No longer, Jove-nurtured"
8611,ARGUMENT.,"Patroclus, will there be aid for the Greeks, but they will fall back"
8612,ARGUMENT.,"upon the black ships. For already all, as many as were once bravest,"
8613,ARGUMENT.,"lie at the ships, stricken or wounded by the hands of the Trojans,"
8614,ARGUMENT.,"whose strength ever increases. But do thou now, indeed, save me,"
8615,ARGUMENT.,"leading me to my black ship; and cut out the arrow from my thigh, and"
8616,ARGUMENT.,wash the black blood 389 from it with warm water; then sprinkle upon it
8617,ARGUMENT.,"mild drugs, salubrious, which they say thou wert taught by Achilles,"
8618,ARGUMENT.,"whom Chiron instructed, the most just of the Centaurs. For the"
8619,ARGUMENT.,"physicians, Podalirius and Machaon, the one, I think, having a wound,"
8620,ARGUMENT.,"lies at the tents, and himself in want of a faultless physician, and"

8660,ARGUMENT.,ships; but they had drawn a foss around (nor had they given splendid
8661,ARGUMENT.,"hecatombs to the gods); that it enclosing within, might defend the"
8662,ARGUMENT.,swift ships and the great booty. But it was built against the will of
8663,ARGUMENT.,"the immortal gods, therefore it remained not perfect for any long"
8664,ARGUMENT.,"period. 390 As long as Hector was alive, and Achilles indignant, and"
8665,ARGUMENT.,"the city of king Priam unravaged, so long was the mighty wall of the"
8666,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks firm. But when all the bravest of the Trojans were dead, and"
8667,ARGUMENT.,"many of the Greeks were subdued, but others left surviving, when in the"
8668,ARGUMENT.,"tenth year the city of Priam was sacked, and the Greeks went in their"
8669,ARGUMENT.,ships to their dear fatherland; then at length Neptune and Apollo took
8670,ARGUMENT.,"counsel to demolish the wall, introducing the strength of rivers, as"
8671,ARGUMENT.,"many as flow into the sea from the Idæan mountains, both the Rhesus and"
8672,ARGUMENT.,"the Heptaporus, the Caresus and the Rhodius, the Granicus and the"
8673,ARGUMENT.,"Æsepus, the divine Scamander and the Simoïs, where many shields and"

8675,ARGUMENT.,"all these Phœbus Apollo turned to the same spot, and for nine days he"
8676,ARGUMENT.,directed their streams against the wall; and Jove in the meantime
8677,ARGUMENT.,"rained continually, that he might the sooner render the walls"

8701,ARGUMENT.,"Hector, the furious cause of flight; for he fought, as formerly, equal"

8703,ARGUMENT.,"and huntsmen, looking dreadfully with strength, and they, drawing"
8704,ARGUMENT.,"themselves up in a square form, 393 stand against him, and hurl"

8706,ARGUMENT.,"alarmed, nor is he put to flight; but his courage proves his death. And"
8707,ARGUMENT.,"frequently he turns round, trying the ranks of men; and wheresoever he"
8708,ARGUMENT.,"has directed his attack, there the ranks of men give way: so Hector,"
8709,ARGUMENT.,"going through the crowd, rolled along, inciting his companions to cross"
8710,ARGUMENT.,the trench. Nor did the swift-footed horses dare [it]; 394 but they
8711,ARGUMENT.,"loudly neighed, standing upon the precipitous brink; for the wide ditch"
8712,ARGUMENT.,"affrighted [them], nor was it easy to leap across, [by standing] near,"

8739,ARGUMENT.,"“Hector, and ye other leaders of the Trojans, and allies, unwisely do"
8740,ARGUMENT.,"we drive our fleet steeds through the trench, which is very difficult"
8741,ARGUMENT.,"to pass; since sharp palisades stand in it, and near them is the wall"
8742,ARGUMENT.,of the Greeks. Wherefore it is by no means possible for the cavalry to
8743,ARGUMENT.,"descend, or to fight, for it is a narrow place, where I think they"
8744,ARGUMENT.,"would be wounded. For if indeed lofty-thundering Jove, designing evil,"
8745,ARGUMENT.,"destroys the Greeks, but wishes to assist the Trojans, certainly I"
8746,ARGUMENT.,"would wish this to take place even immediately, that the Greeks perish"
8747,ARGUMENT.,"here inglorious, away from Argos. If, however, they rally, and a"
8748,ARGUMENT.,"repulse from the ships take place, and we be entangled in the dug"
8749,ARGUMENT.,"trench, I do not suppose that then even a messenger will return back to"
8750,ARGUMENT.,"the city from the Greeks. But come, let us all be persuaded as I shall"
8751,ARGUMENT.,"advise. Let the servants keep our horses at the trench, and let us, all"
8752,ARGUMENT.,"on foot, clad in armour, follow Hector in a close body; but the Greeks"
8753,ARGUMENT.,"will not withstand us, if indeed the end of destruction hang over"
8754,ARGUMENT.,them.”
8755,ARGUMENT.,
8756,ARGUMENT.,Thus spake Polydamas; but the safe counsel pleased Hector; and
8757,ARGUMENT.,immediately he leaped with his armour from his chariot on the ground.
8758,ARGUMENT.,"Nor did the other Trojans assemble on horseback, but dismounting, they"
8759,ARGUMENT.,"rushed on, when they beheld noble Hector. Then each commanded his own"
8760,ARGUMENT.,"charioteer to rein his steeds in good order there at the trench, and"
8761,ARGUMENT.,"they, separating, drawing themselves up, and being arranged in five"
8762,ARGUMENT.,"columns, followed along with their leaders. Some then went with Hector"
8763,ARGUMENT.,"and illustrious Polydamas, who were most numerous and brave, and who"
8764,ARGUMENT.,"were most resolutely desirous, having broken down the wall, to fight at"
8765,ARGUMENT.,the hollow ships. And Cebriones followed as a third; for Hector left
8766,ARGUMENT.,"another, inferior to Cebriones, with his chariot. Others Paris"
8767,ARGUMENT.,"commanded, and Alcathous, and Agenor. The third band Helenus and"
8768,ARGUMENT.,"godlike Deïphobus, two sons of Priam; but the third [commander] was the"
8769,ARGUMENT.,"hero Asius, Asius son of Hyrtacus, whom fiery, tall steeds brought from"
8770,ARGUMENT.,"Arisba, from the river Selleïs. But the fourth, Æneas, the brave son of"
8771,ARGUMENT.,"Anchises, led; along with him were the two sons of Antenor, Archilochus"
8772,ARGUMENT.,"and Acamas, well skilled in every kind of fight. But Sarpedon commanded"
8773,ARGUMENT.,"the illustrious allies, and chose to himself Glaucus and warlike"
8774,ARGUMENT.,"Asteropæus; for they appeared to him, next to himself decidedly the"
8775,ARGUMENT.,"bravest of the rest: for he, indeed, excelled among all. When they then"
8776,ARGUMENT.,"had fitted each other together 396 with interlaced ox-hide bucklers,"
8777,ARGUMENT.,"they advanced, full of courage, direct against the Greeks, nor expected"
8778,ARGUMENT.,"that they would sustain them, but that they would fall in flight into"
8779,ARGUMENT.,their black ships.
8780,ARGUMENT.,
8781,ARGUMENT.,Then the other Trojans and far-summoned allies obeyed the counsel of
8782,ARGUMENT.,"blameless Polydamas; but Asius, son of Hyrtacus, leader of heroes, was"
8783,ARGUMENT.,"unwilling to relinquish his horses and attendant charioteer, but with"
8784,ARGUMENT.,"them advanced to the swift ships,—foolish! Nor was he destined to"
8785,ARGUMENT.,"return again, borne on his steeds and chariot from the ships to"
8786,ARGUMENT.,"wind-swept Ilium, having avoided evil destiny. For him unlucky fate"
8787,ARGUMENT.,"first encircled from the spear of Idomeneus, the illustrious son of"
8788,ARGUMENT.,"Deucalion. For he rushed towards the left of the ships, by the way in"
8789,ARGUMENT.,which the Greeks were returning from the plain with their horses and
8790,ARGUMENT.,"chariots. Thither he drove his horses and his chariot, nor did he find"
8791,ARGUMENT.,"the gates closed 397 in the portal, or the long bar up, but the men"
8792,ARGUMENT.,"held them wide open, that they might safely receive at the ships any of"
8793,ARGUMENT.,their companions flying from the battle. He designedly guided his
8794,ARGUMENT.,"steeds right onward in that way, and [his troops], shrilly shouting,"
8795,ARGUMENT.,followed along with him; for they supposed that the Greeks could no
8796,ARGUMENT.,"longer sustain them, but would fall in flight into the black"
8797,ARGUMENT.,"ships—fools! for at the gates they found two very brave heroes, the"
8798,ARGUMENT.,"magnanimous sons of the warlike Lapithæ, the one the son of Pirithous,"
8799,ARGUMENT.,"gallant Polypœtes, the other Leonteus, equal to man-slaughtering Mars."
8800,ARGUMENT.,"These two then stood before the lofty gates, as tall oaks on the"
8801,ARGUMENT.,"mountains, which abide the wind and rain at all seasons, remaining"
8802,ARGUMENT.,"firmly fixed by their great and wide-spreading roots; so they too,"
8803,ARGUMENT.,"trusting to their hands and strength, awaited mighty Asius coming on,"
8804,ARGUMENT.,"nor fled. But the troops, lifting high their well-seasoned bucklers,"
8805,ARGUMENT.,"advanced with loud shouting directly towards the well-built wall, round"
8806,ARGUMENT.,"their king Asius, and Iämenus, and Orestes, Acamas, the son of Asius,"
8807,ARGUMENT.,"Thoon, and Œnomäus. Hitherto indeed these, remaining within, were"
8808,ARGUMENT.,exhorting the well-armed Greeks to fight for the ships; but when they
8809,ARGUMENT.,"perceived the Trojans rushing against the wall, and confusion and"
8810,ARGUMENT.,"flight of the Greeks arose, both darting out, fought before the gates,"
8811,ARGUMENT.,"like unto wild boars, which await the approaching tumult of men and"
8812,ARGUMENT.,"dogs in the mountains, and, advancing obliquely to the attack, break"
8813,ARGUMENT.,"down the wood around them, cutting it to the root; and a gnashing of"
8814,ARGUMENT.,"teeth arises from beneath, till some one, having taken aim, deprive"
8815,ARGUMENT.,"them of life. So resounded the shining brass upon their breasts,"
8816,ARGUMENT.,"smitten in front, for very valiantly they fought, trusting to the"
8817,ARGUMENT.,"troops above, and to their own valour. But they hurled stones down from"
8818,ARGUMENT.,"the well-built towers, defending themselves, their tents, and the"
8819,ARGUMENT.,"swift-voyaging ships. And as snow-flakes fall upon the earth, which the"
8820,ARGUMENT.,"violent wind, having disturbed the shady clouds, pours down thick upon"
8821,ARGUMENT.,the fertile soil; thus poured the weapons from the hands as well of the
8822,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks as of the Trojans; and the helmets and bossy shields, smitten"
8823,ARGUMENT.,"with large stones, sounded drily around. Then indeed Asius, son of"
8824,ARGUMENT.,"Hyrtacus, groaned, and smote both his thighs, and indignant exclaimed:"
8825,ARGUMENT.,
8826,ARGUMENT.,"“Father Jove, surely now at least thou also hast become utterly"
8827,ARGUMENT.,deceitful; for I did not expect that the Grecian heroes would abide our
8828,ARGUMENT.,"strength and invincible hands. But they, as wasps flexible 398 in the"
8829,ARGUMENT.,"middle, and bees, [which] make their dwellings in a rugged path, nor"
8830,ARGUMENT.,"quit their hollow mansion; but awaiting the huntsmen, fight for their"
8831,ARGUMENT.,"offspring; so are these unwilling to retire from the gates, though"
8832,ARGUMENT.,"being only two, until they be either killed or taken.”"

8852,ARGUMENT.,meantime others were waging the battle at other gates; but difficult
8853,ARGUMENT.,"would it be for me, as if I were a god, to enumerate all these things;"
8854,ARGUMENT.,for around the wall in every direction a furiously-raging fire of
8855,ARGUMENT.,"stones was aroused, 399 and the Greeks, although grieving, fought from"
8856,ARGUMENT.,necessity for their ships; and all the gods were sorrowful in their

8868,ARGUMENT.,"brazen blade burst quite through the bone, and all the brain within was"

8870,ARGUMENT.,"Pylon and Ormenus. And Leonteus, a branch of Mars, wounded Hippomachus,"

8879,ARGUMENT.,"eager to break down the wall, and burn the ships with fire, followed"
8880,ARGUMENT.,"Polydamas and Hector, and they anxiously deliberated, standing at the"
8881,ARGUMENT.,trench. For an augury had appeared on the left to them while eager to
8882,ARGUMENT.,"cross, a high-flying eagle dividing the people, 400 bearing in his"
8883,ARGUMENT.,"talons a monstrous blood-stained serpent, alive, still panting; nor was"
8884,ARGUMENT.,"it yet forgetful of fighting; for, while holding it, writhing"
8885,ARGUMENT.,"backwards, it wounded him upon the breast near the neck; but he let it"
8886,ARGUMENT.,"drop from him to the ground, afflicted with anguish, and threw it into"
8887,ARGUMENT.,"the midst of the crowd, and, flapping his wings, he fled away with the"
8888,ARGUMENT.,breeze of the wind. And the Trojans shuddered as they beheld the
8889,ARGUMENT.,"spotted serpent lying in the midst, a prodigy of ægis-bearing Jove."
8890,ARGUMENT.,"Then Polydamas, standing near, addressed gallant Hector:"
8891,ARGUMENT.,
8892,ARGUMENT.,"“Hector, somehow or other thou art ever chiding me in the assemblies,"
8893,ARGUMENT.,although proposing good counsels; because it is by no means becoming
8894,ARGUMENT.,"for a man, being a citizen, to harangue contrary to thee, either in"
8895,ARGUMENT.,council or at any time in war; but ever to increase thy authority. Yet
8896,ARGUMENT.,will I again speak as appears to me to be best. Let us not go about to
8897,ARGUMENT.,"fight with the Greeks for their ships; for thus do I think it will end,"
8898,ARGUMENT.,"as sure as this augury has come to the Trojans desiring to cross, the"
8899,ARGUMENT.,"high-flying eagle upon the left dividing the army, bearing in its"
8900,ARGUMENT.,"talons a huge blood-stained serpent, [still] living; but presently it"
8901,ARGUMENT.,"dropped it, before it reached its dear home, nor succeeded in carrying"
8902,ARGUMENT.,"it to give it to its young: so we, if even we shall with great force"
8903,ARGUMENT.,"break through the gates and wall of the Greeks, and the Greeks shall"
8904,ARGUMENT.,"give way,—not in order shall we return by the same way from the ships:"
8905,ARGUMENT.,"for we shall leave many Trojans, whom the Greeks, fighting for the"
8906,ARGUMENT.,"ships, will subdue with the brass. Thus indeed would the diviner, who"

8921,ARGUMENT.,"the counsels of lofty-thundering Jove, which he hath himself undertaken"
8922,ARGUMENT.,"for me, and confirmed. And thou exhortest me to obey the wing-expanding"
8923,ARGUMENT.,"birds; which I very little regard, nor do I care for them, whether they"
8924,ARGUMENT.,"fly to the right towards the Morn and the Sun, or to the left towards"
8925,ARGUMENT.,"the darkening west; but let us obey the will of mighty Jove, who rules"
8926,ARGUMENT.,"over all mortals and immortals. There is one augury, the best, to fight"
8927,ARGUMENT.,for our country. 401 Why dost thou dread the war and conflict? For
8928,ARGUMENT.,although all the rest of us should perish round the ships of the
8929,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks, there is no fear that thou wilt perish, for thy heart is not"
8930,ARGUMENT.,"persevering in the fight, nor warlike. But if thou darest to abstain"
8931,ARGUMENT.,"from the combat, or dissuading, dost avert another from the battle,"
8932,ARGUMENT.,"immediately stricken by my spear, shalt thou lose thy life.”"
8933,ARGUMENT.,
8934,ARGUMENT.,"Thus then having spoken, he led the way, but they followed him with an"
8935,ARGUMENT.,immense clamour. Then thunder-delighting Jove raised a storm of wind
8936,ARGUMENT.,"from the Idæan mountains, which bore the dust directly towards the"
8937,ARGUMENT.,"ships; moreover, he weakened the courage of the Greeks, but bestowed"
8938,ARGUMENT.,"glory upon the Trojans and Hector: so that, relying upon his prodigies,"
8939,ARGUMENT.,"and [their own] strength, they endeavoured to break through the mighty"
8940,ARGUMENT.,wall of the Greeks. They tore down the niched battlements of the
8941,ARGUMENT.,"towers, and demolished the breast-works, 402 and with levers they"
8942,ARGUMENT.,"upheaved the projecting buttresses, which the Greeks had planted first"
8943,ARGUMENT.,"in the earth, as supporters of the towers. These then they tore down,"

8947,ARGUMENT.,"embrazures with their ox-hide shields, they wounded from behind them"

8949,ARGUMENT.,"direction upon the towers, cheering on, rousing the valour of the"
8950,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks. One [they addressed] 403 with soothing, another they rebuked"

8974,ARGUMENT.,"of them—as when frequent flakes of snow fall upon a winter’s day, when"
8975,ARGUMENT.,"provident Jove has begun to snow, displaying his weapons in the sight"
8976,ARGUMENT.,"of men, and, having lulled the winds, pours it down incessantly, till"
8977,ARGUMENT.,"he covers the tops and highest peaks of the lofty mountains, and the"
8978,ARGUMENT.,lotus plains and rich husbandry of men: and likewise it is poured out
8979,ARGUMENT.,upon the havens and shores of the hoary sea; but the approaching wave
8980,ARGUMENT.,"restrains its progress, whilst all other things are covered beneath it,"

8982,ARGUMENT.,"from those hurling on both sides, some indeed towards the Trojans, and"
8983,ARGUMENT.,others from the Trojans towards the Greeks. And along the whole wall a
8984,ARGUMENT.,tumult arose.
8985,ARGUMENT.,
8986,ARGUMENT.,Yet never would the Trojans and illustrious Hector have burst open the
8987,ARGUMENT.,"gates of the wall, and the long bolt, had not provident Jove urged on"

8989,ARGUMENT.,"crooked-horned oxen. But he immediately held before him his shield,"

8991,ARGUMENT.,"had plated over, and underneath had sewed together thick bulls’ hides,"
8992,ARGUMENT.,"with successive golden wires round its orb. He then, holding this"
8993,ARGUMENT.,"before him, advanced, brandishing two spears, like a lion reared in the"
8994,ARGUMENT.,"mountains, which hath been long in want of flesh, and whose valiant"
8995,ARGUMENT.,"mind impels him to go even to the well-fenced fold, about to make an"
8996,ARGUMENT.,attempt upon the sheep. And although he there find the shepherds
8997,ARGUMENT.,"keeping watch about their flocks with dogs and spears, still he cannot"
8998,ARGUMENT.,"bear to be driven away, without having made trial of the fold, but,"
8999,ARGUMENT.,"springing in, he either carries [one] off, or is himself wounded among"
9000,ARGUMENT.,the first by a javelin from a quick hand. Thus then did his mind impel

9005,ARGUMENT.,"[first] seat in banquet, and with full goblets, and why do all look to"
9006,ARGUMENT.,us as to gods? Why do we also possess a great and beautiful enclosure
9007,ARGUMENT.,"of the vine-bearing and corn-bearing land on the banks of Xanthus? Now,"
9008,ARGUMENT.,"therefore, it behoves us, advancing among the foremost Lycians, to"
9009,ARGUMENT.,"stand firm, and to bear the brunt of the raging fight; so that some one"
9010,ARGUMENT.,"of the closely-armed Lycians may say, ‘By no means inglorious do our"
9011,ARGUMENT.,"kings govern Lycia, and eat the fat sheep, and [drink] 405 the choice"
9012,ARGUMENT.,"sweet wine; but their valour likewise is excelling, because they fight"
9013,ARGUMENT.,"among the foremost Lycians.’ O dear friend, if indeed, by escaping from"
9014,ARGUMENT.,"this war, we were destined to be ever free from old age, and immortal,"
9015,ARGUMENT.,"neither would I combat myself in the van, nor send thee into the"
9016,ARGUMENT.,glorious battle. But now—for of a truth ten thousand Fates of death
9017,ARGUMENT.,"press upon us, which it is not possible for a mortal to escape or"
9018,ARGUMENT.,"avoid—let us on: either we shall give glory to some one, or some one to"
9019,ARGUMENT.,us.”
9020,ARGUMENT.,
9021,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spake, nor did Glaucus turn aside or disobey, but both advanced"
9022,ARGUMENT.,"straight forward, leading a numerous band of Lycians. But Menestheus,"
9023,ARGUMENT.,"the son of Peteus, beholding them, shuddered, for they were advancing"
9024,ARGUMENT.,"towards his company, bearing destruction. He looked round along the"
9025,ARGUMENT.,"line of the Greeks, if he might see any of the leaders who could ward"
9026,ARGUMENT.,"off the fight from his companions, and perceived the two Ajaces,"
9027,ARGUMENT.,"insatiable of war, standing, and Teucer, lately come from his tent,"
9028,ARGUMENT.,near at hand. Yet was it not possible for him to be heard when
9029,ARGUMENT.,"shouting, so great was the din; and the crash of stricken shields, and"
9030,ARGUMENT.,"of horse-hair crested helmets, and of the gates, reached to heaven. For"
9031,ARGUMENT.,"they had assailed all, 406 and they, standing beside them, endeavoured"
9032,ARGUMENT.,"to enter, bursting them open by force. But immediately he despatched"
9033,ARGUMENT.,the herald Thoötes to Ajax:

9053,ARGUMENT.,"“Go, noble Thoötes, running, call Ajax, rather indeed both: for this"
9054,ARGUMENT.,"would be by far the best of all, since in a short while heavy"
9055,ARGUMENT.,destruction will arise here. For so vigorously do the leaders of the
9056,ARGUMENT.,"Lycians press on, who even before were impetuous in the sharp contest."
9057,ARGUMENT.,"If, however, labour and contest have arisen to them there, at least let"
9058,ARGUMENT.,"brave Telamonian Ajax come, and with him let Teucer follow, well"
9059,ARGUMENT.,skilled in archery.”
9060,ARGUMENT.,
9061,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke, nor did the herald, having heard him, disobey, but he"
9062,ARGUMENT.,"hastened to run along the wall of the brazen-mailed Greeks, and"
9063,ARGUMENT.,"proceeding, he stood beside the Ajaces and immediately addressed them:"
9064,ARGUMENT.,
9065,ARGUMENT.,"“Ye Ajaces, leaders of the brazen-mailed Greeks, the beloved son of"
9066,ARGUMENT.,"Jove-nourished Peteus adjures you to come thither, that ye may"
9067,ARGUMENT.,"participate in his toil, though for a short time. Both indeed in"
9068,ARGUMENT.,"preference, for this would be by far the best of all things, since soon"
9069,ARGUMENT.,will heavy destruction arise there. For so vigorously do the leaders of
9070,ARGUMENT.,"the Lycians press on, who even before were impetuous in the sharp"
9071,ARGUMENT.,"contest. But if here also war and contest have arisen, at least let"
9072,ARGUMENT.,"brave Telamonian Ajax come alone, and with him let Teucer follow, well"
9073,ARGUMENT.,skilled in archery.”
9074,ARGUMENT.,
9075,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spake, nor did mighty Telamonian Ajax disobey. Instantly he"
9076,ARGUMENT.,addressed to the son of Oïleus winged words:
9077,ARGUMENT.,
9078,ARGUMENT.,"“Ajax, do thou and gallant Lycomedes, standing here, incite the Greeks"
9079,ARGUMENT.,"to fight bravely, whilst I go thither and oppose the battle; but I will"
9080,ARGUMENT.,"return again instantly, after I shall have assisted them.”"
9081,ARGUMENT.,
9082,ARGUMENT.,"Thus then having spoken, Telamonian Ajax departed, and with him went"
9083,ARGUMENT.,"Teucer, his brother, sprung from the same father; and Pandion, along"
9084,ARGUMENT.,"with them, carried the bent bow of Teucer. As soon as they reached the"
9085,ARGUMENT.,"tower of magnanimous Menestheus, going within the wall (for they came"
9086,ARGUMENT.,to [their friends] being hard pressed: and the brave leaders and chiefs
9087,ARGUMENT.,of the Lycians were mounting upon the breast-works like unto a dark
9088,ARGUMENT.,"whirlwind), but they engaged to fight in opposition, and a clamour"
9089,ARGUMENT.,"arose. Telamonian Ajax first slew a man, the companion of Sarpedon,"
9090,ARGUMENT.,"magnanimous Epicles, striking him with a rugged stone, which, mighty in"
9091,ARGUMENT.,"size, lay highest up against a pinnacle within the wall. Not easily"
9092,ARGUMENT.,"would a man support it with both hands, such as mortals now are, not"
9093,ARGUMENT.,"although being very youthful; but he, raising it aloft, hurled it, and"
9094,ARGUMENT.,"burst the four-coned helmet, and along with it crushed all the bones of"
9095,ARGUMENT.,"the skull: but he, like unto a diver, fell from the lofty tower, and"
9096,ARGUMENT.,"life deserted his bones. Teucer likewise with a shaft wounded Glaucus,"
9097,ARGUMENT.,"the brave son of Hippolochus, as he was rushing on, against the lofty"
9098,ARGUMENT.,"wall, in a part where he perceived his arm naked; and made him cease"
9099,ARGUMENT.,"from combat. But he sprang back from the wall, concealing himself, that"
9100,ARGUMENT.,"none of the Greeks might perceive him wounded, and insult him with"
9101,ARGUMENT.,"words. Then grief came upon Sarpedon on account of Glaucus departing,"
9102,ARGUMENT.,as soon as he observed it; though he nevertheless was not neglectful of
9103,ARGUMENT.,"the contest: but he taking aim, wounded Alcmaon, son of Thestor, with"
9104,ARGUMENT.,"his spear, and extracted the spear; but he. following the weapon, fell"
9105,ARGUMENT.,"prone, and his armour, variously decked with brass, resounded upon him."
9106,ARGUMENT.,"Sarpedon then seizing the buttress with his sturdy hands, pulled, and"
9107,ARGUMENT.,"it all followed entirely; but the wall was stripped away from above,"
9108,ARGUMENT.,and he formed a way for many. Then Ajax and Teucer aiming at him
9109,ARGUMENT.,"together, the one smote him with an arrow in the splendid belt of his"
9110,ARGUMENT.,"mortal-girding shield, around his breast; but Jove averted the fate"
9111,ARGUMENT.,"from his son, that he might not be slain at the sterns of the ships."
9112,ARGUMENT.,"But Ajax, springing upon him, struck his shield, and pierced him quite"
9113,ARGUMENT.,"through with his spear, and forcibly checked him eager. And then he"
9114,ARGUMENT.,"fell back for a little from the buttress, but did not altogether"
9115,ARGUMENT.,"retreat, because his spirit hoped to bear off glory. And turning round,"
9116,ARGUMENT.,he encouraged the godlike Lycians:
9117,ARGUMENT.,
9118,ARGUMENT.,"“O Lycians, why are ye thus remiss in your impetuous force? It is"
9119,ARGUMENT.,"difficult for me, although being brave, having alone burst through, to"
9120,ARGUMENT.,form a way to the ships. But follow along with me; for the labour of
9121,ARGUMENT.,the greater number is better.”
9122,ARGUMENT.,
9123,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spake; and they, reverencing the exhortation of their king,"
9124,ARGUMENT.,pressed on with more alacrity round their counsel-giving king. And the
9125,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks, on the other side, strengthened their phalanxes within the"
9126,ARGUMENT.,"wall, because a great work presented itself to them. For neither could"
9127,ARGUMENT.,"the gallant Lycians, bursting through the wall of the Greeks, make"
9128,ARGUMENT.,"their way to the ships, nor could the warlike Greeks repulse the"
9129,ARGUMENT.,"Lycians from the wall, since first they approached it. But as two men,"
9130,ARGUMENT.,"holding measures in their hands, dispute, in a common field, 407"
9131,ARGUMENT.,"concerning their boundaries, who in a small space contend for their"
9132,ARGUMENT.,"equitable right; thus did the buttresses separate these [warriors],"
9133,ARGUMENT.,"and, for them, each smote the well-rounded ox-hide shields around each"
9134,ARGUMENT.,"other’s breasts, and the light bucklers of each other. And many were"
9135,ARGUMENT.,"wounded upon the body with the merciless brass, whether the back of any"
9136,ARGUMENT.,"combatant, averted, was laid bare, and many right through the shield"
9137,ARGUMENT.,"itself. Everywhere the towers and buttresses were sprinkled, on both"
9138,ARGUMENT.,"sides, with the blood of heroes, from the Trojans and the Greeks. Yet"
9139,ARGUMENT.,"not even thus could they cause a flight of the Greeks, but they held"
9140,ARGUMENT.,"themselves, as a just woman, who labours with her hands, does the"
9141,ARGUMENT.,"scales, 408 who, poising both the weight and the wool, draws them on"
9142,ARGUMENT.,"either side to equalize them, that she may procure a scanty pittance"
9143,ARGUMENT.,for the support of her children. Thus equally was their battle and war
9144,ARGUMENT.,"extended, before the time when Jove gave superior glory to Hector, the"
9145,ARGUMENT.,"son of Priam, who first leaped within the wall of the Greeks, and"
9146,ARGUMENT.,"shouted with a penetrating voice, calling out to the Trojans:"
9147,ARGUMENT.,
9148,ARGUMENT.,"“Push on, ye horse-breaking Trojans, burst through the wall of the"
9149,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks, and hurl the fiercely-blazing fire against the ships.”"
9150,ARGUMENT.,
9151,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spake, cheering them on; but they all heard him with their"
9152,ARGUMENT.,"ears, and rushed against the wall in great numbers, and then mounted"
9153,ARGUMENT.,"the battlements, carrying their pointed spears. But Hector seizing it,"
9154,ARGUMENT.,"took up a stone, which stood before the gates, widening out at the"
9155,ARGUMENT.,"base, 409 but sharp above; which two men, the strongest of the people,"
9156,ARGUMENT.,"such as mortals now are, could not easily raise from the ground upon a"
9157,ARGUMENT.,"waggon. He, however, brandished it easily and alone, because the son of"
9158,ARGUMENT.,wise Saturn had rendered it light to him.

9175,ARGUMENT.,"strengthened the closely-jointed gates, double and lofty; but two"
9176,ARGUMENT.,"cross-bars secured them within, and one key fitted them. But advancing,"
9177,ARGUMENT.,"he stood very near, and exerting his strength, struck them in the"
9178,ARGUMENT.,"middle, standing with his legs wide asunder, that the blow of the"
9179,ARGUMENT.,"weapon might not be weak. And he tore away both hinges, and the stone"
9180,ARGUMENT.,fell within with a great weight; and the gates crashed around; nor did
9181,ARGUMENT.,"the bars withstand it, but the beams were rent asunder in different"
9182,ARGUMENT.,directions by the impulse of the stone. There illustrious Hector rushed
9183,ARGUMENT.,"in, in aspect like unto the dreadful night; and he glittered in"
9184,ARGUMENT.,"terrible brass, with which he was girt around his body. And he held two"
9185,ARGUMENT.,"spears in his hands, nor could any one, opposing, restrain him, except"
9186,ARGUMENT.,"the gods, after he had leaped within the gates; but his eyes gleamed"
9187,ARGUMENT.,"with fire. And turning to the crowd, he cheered on the Trojans to"
9188,ARGUMENT.,"ascend the wall, and they obeyed him encouraging. Straightway indeed"
9189,ARGUMENT.,"some crossed the wall, and others were poured in through the"
9190,ARGUMENT.,"well-wrought gates, but the Greeks were routed towards the hollow"

9244,ARGUMENT.,"rugged mountain, rapidly advancing on foot, and the high hills and"
9245,ARGUMENT.,"woods trembled beneath the immortal feet of Neptune, advancing. Thrice"
9246,ARGUMENT.,"indeed he strode, advancing, and with the fourth step he reached Ægæ,"
9247,ARGUMENT.,"his destined goal. There distinguished mansions, golden, glittering,"

9249,ARGUMENT.,"Coming thither, he yoked beneath his chariot the brazen-footed steeds,"

9278,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks, and slay all the Greeks beside them. But earth-ruling,"
9279,ARGUMENT.,"earth-shaking Neptune, coming from the deep sea, aroused the Greeks,"
9280,ARGUMENT.,assimilating his person and indefatigable voice to Calchas. The Ajaces
9281,ARGUMENT.,"he first addressed, though themselves were earnest:"
9282,ARGUMENT.,
9283,ARGUMENT.,"“Ye Ajaces, ye indeed, mindful of valour, not of direful flight, will"

9286,ARGUMENT.,"surmounted the great wall, because the well-greaved Greeks will sustain"
9287,ARGUMENT.,"them all. But in that place I grievously fear lest we suffer any thing,"
9288,ARGUMENT.,"where infuriated Hector, like unto a flame, leads on who boasts to be"
9289,ARGUMENT.,the son of almighty Jove. But may some of the gods thus put it in your
9290,ARGUMENT.,"minds, that ye stand firmly yourselves, and exhort others; thus may ye"
9291,ARGUMENT.,"drive him, although impetuous, from the swift-sailing ships, even if"
9292,ARGUMENT.,Jove himself excites him.”
9293,ARGUMENT.,
9294,ARGUMENT.,"He said, and earth-ruling Neptune, striking both with his sceptre,"
9295,ARGUMENT.,"filled them with violent might, and made their limbs light and their"
9296,ARGUMENT.,"feet and hands above. But he, like as a swift-winged hawk is impelled"
9297,ARGUMENT.,"to fly, which, lifted up from a rugged, lofty rock, has hastened to"
9298,ARGUMENT.,pursue another bird over the plain; so darted earth-shaking Neptune
9299,ARGUMENT.,"from them. But fleet Ajax, the son of Oïleus, recognized him first of"
9300,ARGUMENT.,"the two, and straightway addressed Ajax, the son of Telamon:"
9301,ARGUMENT.,
9302,ARGUMENT.,"“O Ajax, since some one of the gods, who possess Olympus, likening"
9303,ARGUMENT.,"himself to the soothsayer, exhorts us to fight beside the ships"
9304,ARGUMENT.,"(neither is this Calchas, the prophesying augur; for I readily"
9305,ARGUMENT.,recognized the traces of his feet and legs when departing; for the gods
9306,ARGUMENT.,"are easily distinguished), even to myself, the soul within my bosom is"
9307,ARGUMENT.,"more incited to war and to fight, and my feet beneath and hands above"
9308,ARGUMENT.,eagerly desire it.”
9309,ARGUMENT.,
9310,ARGUMENT.,"But him Telamonian Ajax answering, addressed: “So also to me are my"
9311,ARGUMENT.,"strong hands upon my spear eager, and my courage is aroused, and I am"
9312,ARGUMENT.,"hurried along by both my feet under me; and I eagerly long, even alone,"
9313,ARGUMENT.,"to combat with Hector, the son of Priam, insatiably raging.”"
9314,ARGUMENT.,
9315,ARGUMENT.,"Thus they addressed these words to each other, joyful in the desire of"
9316,ARGUMENT.,battle 414 which the god had infused into their minds. In the meanwhile
9317,ARGUMENT.,"the Earth-ruler (Neptune) aroused the Achæans in the rear, who were"
9318,ARGUMENT.,recruiting their spirit at the swift ships; whose limbs were at the

9320,ARGUMENT.,"minds, beholding the Trojans, who with a tumult had surmounted the vast"
9321,ARGUMENT.,"wall. But beholding them, they poured forth tears from beneath their"
9322,ARGUMENT.,"eyebrows, for they expected not to escape destruction: but the"
9323,ARGUMENT.,"Earth-shaker intervening, easily aroused the brave phalanxes. To Teucer"
9324,ARGUMENT.,"and Leius he first came, exhorting them, and to the hero Peneleus, and"
9325,ARGUMENT.,"Thoas, and Deipyrus, and to Meriones and Antilochus, skilful in war."

9341,ARGUMENT.,"perverseness of our general, and the indifference of the troops; who,"
9342,ARGUMENT.,"disputing with him, are unwilling to defend the swift ships, but are"
9343,ARGUMENT.,"slain among them. Yet although in reality the hero, the son of Atreus,"
9344,ARGUMENT.,"wide-ruling Agamemnon, be altogether in fault, in that he hath"
9345,ARGUMENT.,"dishonoured the swift-footed son of Peleus, still it is by no means our"
9346,ARGUMENT.,"duty to be remiss in battle, but let us the sooner repair [the"
9347,ARGUMENT.,mischief]; 415 the minds of the brave are easily appeased. But they by
9348,ARGUMENT.,"no means honourably remit your impetuous valour, being all the bravest"
9349,ARGUMENT.,in the army: I indeed would not quarrel with a man who should desist
9350,ARGUMENT.,"from combat, being unwarlike; but with you I am indignant from my"
9351,ARGUMENT.,heart. O soft ones! surely will ye soon create some greater evil by
9352,ARGUMENT.,this inertness: but do each of you in his mind ponder on the shame and
9353,ARGUMENT.,reproach; for certainly a mighty contest hath arisen. Now indeed brave
9354,ARGUMENT.,"Hector, good in the din of war, combats at the ships, and hath burst"
9355,ARGUMENT.,through the gates and the long bar.”

9362,ARGUMENT.,"Thus then Neptune, exhorting, aroused the Greeks. But round the two"
9363,ARGUMENT.,"Ajaces firm phalanxes stood, which not even Mars, coming amongst them,"
9364,ARGUMENT.,"would have found fault with, nor Minerva, the confounder of armies; for"
9365,ARGUMENT.,the bravest selected awaited the Trojans and noble Hector; knitting
9366,ARGUMENT.,"spear with spear, shield with shield, 416 one upon another, 417 so that"
9367,ARGUMENT.,"shield pressed upon shield, helmet upon helmet, and man upon man. And"
9368,ARGUMENT.,"the horse-haired helmets of them, nodding, touched each other with"
9369,ARGUMENT.,"their splendid ridges, 418 so closely stood they to one another; and"
9370,ARGUMENT.,"spears in the act of being hurled, were brandishing from their daring"
9371,ARGUMENT.,"hands, whilst they wished [to go] straight [against the enemy], and"
9372,ARGUMENT.,"were eager to fight. But the combined Trojans first made the attack,"
9373,ARGUMENT.,and impetuous Hector first rushed against them: as a
9374,ARGUMENT.,"destructively-rolling stone from a rock, which a wintry torrent drives"
9375,ARGUMENT.,"down the brow, having burst with a mighty shower the stays of the"
9376,ARGUMENT.,"rugged rock, and bounding along, it rolls, and the forest resounds"
9377,ARGUMENT.,beneath it: but straightway it runs on uninterruptedly until it reach
9378,ARGUMENT.,"the plain, but then it rolls no longer, though impelled; so Hector for"
9379,ARGUMENT.,"a while threatened that he would easily come as far as the sea, to the"
9380,ARGUMENT.,"tents and ships of the Greeks, slaughtering. But when now he met the"
9381,ARGUMENT.,"firm phalanxes, he stopped, being come into close contact; and the sons"
9382,ARGUMENT.,"of the Greeks, opposing, repulsed him from them, striking him with"
9383,ARGUMENT.,"their swords and two-edged spears; but retiring, he was compelled to"
9384,ARGUMENT.,withdraw; and he cried out shouting audibly to the Trojans:
9385,ARGUMENT.,
9386,ARGUMENT.,"“Ye Trojans and Lycians, and close-fighting Dardanians, stand firm. Not"
9387,ARGUMENT.,"long will the Greeks withstand me, although they have drawn themselves"
9388,ARGUMENT.,"up in very dense array. 419 But, I conceive, they will retire from my"
9389,ARGUMENT.,"spear, if in truth the most powerful of the gods, the high-thundering"
9390,ARGUMENT.,"husband of Juno, hath urged me on.”"

9403,ARGUMENT.,
9404,ARGUMENT.,"So saying, he aroused the might and courage of each. But Deïphobus, the"
9405,ARGUMENT.,"son of Priam, walked amongst them, high-minded, and he held his shield"
9406,ARGUMENT.,"equal on all sides before him, proceeding with light step, and"
9407,ARGUMENT.,advancing under protection of his shield. Then Meriones took aim with
9408,ARGUMENT.,"his shining spear, and struck him (nor did he miss) upon the"
9409,ARGUMENT.,"bull’s-hide shield, equal on all sides, which he did not pierce; for"
9410,ARGUMENT.,"the long spear, far before was broken at the socket. But Deïphobus held"
9411,ARGUMENT.,"his bull’s-hide shield far from him, for he dreaded in his mind the"
9412,ARGUMENT.,spear of warlike Meriones; but that hero fell back into the column of
9413,ARGUMENT.,"his companions, for he was grievously enraged on both accounts, both"
9414,ARGUMENT.,"for [the loss] of the victory, and of the spear which he had broken."
9415,ARGUMENT.,"Accordingly he proceeded to pass by the tents and ships of the Greeks,"
9416,ARGUMENT.,to bring a long spear which had been left in his tent; whilst the
9417,ARGUMENT.,"others fought, and a mighty tumult arose."
9418,ARGUMENT.,
9419,ARGUMENT.,"Then Telamonian Teucer first slew a hero, the warrior Imbrius, son of"
9420,ARGUMENT.,"Mentor, rich in steeds; and he dwelt at Pedæum before the sons of the"
9421,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks arrived, and had married Medesicaste, the illegitimate daughter"
9422,ARGUMENT.,"of Priam. But when the equally-plied ships of the Greeks arrived, he"
9423,ARGUMENT.,"came back to Ilium, and excelled among the Trojans; and dwelt with"
9424,ARGUMENT.,"Priam, who honoured him equally with his sons. Him the son of Telamon"
9425,ARGUMENT.,"smote under the ear with his long javelin, and plucked out the spear;"
9426,ARGUMENT.,"but he indeed fell, like an ash, which, on the summit of a mountain"
9427,ARGUMENT.,"conspicuous from afar, cut down with a brazen axe, strews its tender"
9428,ARGUMENT.,"foliage on the earth. Thus he fell, and his armour, variegated with"
9429,ARGUMENT.,"brass, rang about him. Then Teucer rushed on, eager to strip him of his"
9430,ARGUMENT.,"armour; but Hector hurled his shining spear at him, hastening. He,"
9431,ARGUMENT.,"however, seeing it from the opposite side, avoided, by a small space,"
9432,ARGUMENT.,"the brazen spear; and [Hector] wounded with his javelin, on the breast,"
9433,ARGUMENT.,"Amphimachus, son of Cteas, the son of Actor, advancing to the battle;"
9434,ARGUMENT.,"and, falling, he gave a crash, and his arms rang upon him. Then Hector"
9435,ARGUMENT.,rushed to tear from the head of magnanimous Amphimachus the helmet
9436,ARGUMENT.,"fitted to his temples, but Ajax hurled with his shining spear at"
9437,ARGUMENT.,"Hector, rushing on. Yet it never reached his body, for he was protected"
9438,ARGUMENT.,all over with terrible brass; but he smote him upon the boss of the
9439,ARGUMENT.,"shield, and repulsed him with great violence; and he retired from both"
9440,ARGUMENT.,"bodies, and the Greeks drew them away. Then Stichius and noble"
9441,ARGUMENT.,"Menestheus, the leaders of the Athenians, carried Amphimachus to the"
9442,ARGUMENT.,"army of the Greeks, but the two Ajaces, eager for impetuous combat,"
9443,ARGUMENT.,[carried] Imbrius. As two lions bear a goat through the thick
9444,ARGUMENT.,"copse-wood, snatching it from the sharp-toothed dogs, holding it high"
9445,ARGUMENT.,"above the earth in their jaws; so the two warriors, the Ajaces, holding"
9446,ARGUMENT.,"him [Imbrius] aloft, stripped off his armour; but the son of Oïleus,"
9447,ARGUMENT.,"enraged on account of Amphimachus, severed his head from his tender"
9448,ARGUMENT.,"neck, and sent it rolling like a ball through the crowd; but it fell"
9449,ARGUMENT.,before the feet of Hector in the dust.
9450,ARGUMENT.,
9451,ARGUMENT.,"Then indeed was Neptune grieved at heart for his grandson, slain in the"
9452,ARGUMENT.,grievous fight; and he proceeded to go along the tents and ships of the
9453,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks, exhorting the Greeks, and prepared disasters for the Trojans."
9454,ARGUMENT.,"But spear-renowned Idomeneus then met him, returning from a companion"
9455,ARGUMENT.,"who had lately come to him from the battle, wounded in the ham with the"
9456,ARGUMENT.,"sharp brass, whom his comrades had carried in, and he, having given"
9457,ARGUMENT.,"directions to the surgeons, was returning from his tent; for he still"
9458,ARGUMENT.,"desired to participate in the fight. Him king Neptune addressed,"
9459,ARGUMENT.,"assimilating himself, as to his voice, to Thoas, son of Andræmon, who"
9460,ARGUMENT.,"governed the Ætolians throughout all Pleuron and lofty Calydon, and who"
9461,ARGUMENT.,was honoured by the people as a god:
9462,ARGUMENT.,
9463,ARGUMENT.,"“Idomeneus, thou counsellor of the Cretans, where indeed are the"
9464,ARGUMENT.,"threats gone, with which the sons of the Greeks threatened the"
9465,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans?” Whom again in return, Idomeneus, the leader of the Cretans,"
9466,ARGUMENT.,"addressed: “No man, O Thoas, as far as I know, is at present to blame;"
9467,ARGUMENT.,for we are all skilled in warring. Neither does disheartening fear
9468,ARGUMENT.,"detain any one, nor does any one, yielding to sloth, shirk evil strife;"
9469,ARGUMENT.,"but thus, doubtless, it will be agreeable to the all-powerful son of"
9470,ARGUMENT.,"Saturn, that here, far away from Argos, the Greeks shall perish"
9471,ARGUMENT.,"inglorious. But, Thoas—for formerly thou wast warlike, and urged on"
9472,ARGUMENT.,"others when thou didst behold them negligent—so now desist not thyself,"
9473,ARGUMENT.,but exhort each man.”
9474,ARGUMENT.,
9475,ARGUMENT.,"But him earth-shaking Neptune then answered: “Never may that man, O"
9476,ARGUMENT.,"Idomeneus, return from Troy, but let him here be the sport of the dogs,"
9477,ARGUMENT.,"whosoever voluntarily this day shall relax from fighting. But come,"
9478,ARGUMENT.,"taking up arms, advance hither; for it behoves us to hasten these"
9479,ARGUMENT.,"things, if we may be of any service, although but two; for useful is"
9480,ARGUMENT.,"the valour of men, even the very pusillanimous, if combined, whereas we"
9481,ARGUMENT.,both understand how to fight even with the brave.”
9482,ARGUMENT.,
9483,ARGUMENT.,"So saying, the god departed again to the toil of heroes. But Idomeneus,"
9484,ARGUMENT.,"when now he had reached his well-made tent, put on his rich armour"
9485,ARGUMENT.,"around his body, and seized two spears, and hastened to go, like unto"
9486,ARGUMENT.,"the lightning, which the son of Saturn, seizing in his hand, brandishes"
9487,ARGUMENT.,"from glittering Olympus, showing a sign to mortals; and brilliant are"
9488,ARGUMENT.,its rays: so shone the brass around the breast of him running. Then
9489,ARGUMENT.,"Meriones, his good attendant, met him yet near the tent,—for he was"
9490,ARGUMENT.,going to fetch a brazen spear; and the strength of Idomeneus addressed
9491,ARGUMENT.,him:
9492,ARGUMENT.,
9493,ARGUMENT.,"“Meriones, son of Molus, swift of foot, dearest of my companions, why"
9494,ARGUMENT.,"comest thou thus, quitting the war and the contest? Art thou at all"
9495,ARGUMENT.,"wounded, and does the point of a spear afflict thee? Or comest thou to"
9496,ARGUMENT.,"me on any message? For I myself am not desirous to sit within my tent,"
9497,ARGUMENT.,but to fight.”
9498,ARGUMENT.,
9499,ARGUMENT.,"But him prudent Meriones in turn answered: “Idomeneus, thou counsellor"
9500,ARGUMENT.,"of the brazen-mailed Cretans, I come, if there be any spear left within"
9501,ARGUMENT.,"thy tents, to take it: because I indeed have broken that which I"
9502,ARGUMENT.,"formerly had, having struck the shield of ferocious Deïphobus.” Whom"
9503,ARGUMENT.,"again in turn Idomeneus, leader of the Cretans, addressed: “Thou wilt"
9504,ARGUMENT.,"find, if thou desirest [to select from them], one-and-twenty spears"
9505,ARGUMENT.,"standing in my tent against the shining walls, which I have taken from"
9506,ARGUMENT.,"the slain Trojans; for I affirm that I do not fight with hostile men,"
9507,ARGUMENT.,"standing at a distance from them. Hence I have both spears, and bossy"
9508,ARGUMENT.,"shields, and helmets, and corslets, brightly polished.”"
9509,ARGUMENT.,
9510,ARGUMENT.,But him again prudent Meriones addressed in turn: “At my tent also and
9511,ARGUMENT.,"black ship are there many spoils of the Trojans; but they are not near,"
9512,ARGUMENT.,so that I might take them. For neither do I conceive that I am
9513,ARGUMENT.,"forgetful of valour, but I stand among the foremost in glory-giving"
9514,ARGUMENT.,"battle, whenever the contest of war has arisen. I am rather unobserved"
9515,ARGUMENT.,"perhaps, when fighting by some other of the brazen-mailed Greeks; but I"
9516,ARGUMENT.,think that thou knowest me.”
9517,ARGUMENT.,
9518,ARGUMENT.,"Whom again Idomeneus, leader of the Cretans, addressed in turn: “I know"
9519,ARGUMENT.,what thou art as to valour: what necessity is there for thee to
9520,ARGUMENT.,enumerate these things? For if now all we the bravest at the ships
9521,ARGUMENT.,"should be selected for an ambuscade, where the courage of men is"
9522,ARGUMENT.,"especially distinguished, where both the coward as well as the brave"
9523,ARGUMENT.,man is made apparent—for the complexion of the coward on the one hand
9524,ARGUMENT.,"is changed from this to that, nor is his heart calm within his bosom,"
9525,ARGUMENT.,"so that he can rest without trembling, but he shifts his position, and"
9526,ARGUMENT.,"sits upon both his feet, whilst his heart greatly palpitates within his"
9527,ARGUMENT.,"breast, as he is expecting death; and a chattering of his teeth arises."
9528,ARGUMENT.,"But neither is the complexion of the brave man changed, nor is he at"
9529,ARGUMENT.,"all disturbed, after he first sits down in the ambush of heroes; but he"
9530,ARGUMENT.,"burns to be mingled with all haste in direful fight—[no one], in that"
9531,ARGUMENT.,"case, would find fault with thy courage and might. For if, labouring"
9532,ARGUMENT.,"[in the battle], thou wert wounded from a distance, or smitten in close"
9533,ARGUMENT.,"fight, the weapon would not fall upon thy neck behind, nor upon thy"
9534,ARGUMENT.,"back; but it would pierce through either thy breast, or thy stomach, as"
9535,ARGUMENT.,thou wast rushing forward amid the conflict 420 of foremost combatants.
9536,ARGUMENT.,"But come, no longer let us speak of these things, standing like"
9537,ARGUMENT.,"infatuated persons, lest perhaps some one chide us inordinately; but do"
9538,ARGUMENT.,"thou, going to the tent, take a strong spear.”"
9539,ARGUMENT.,
9540,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 420: (return)  Hesych. Όαριστυν μάχην. Etym. Μ. fol. 131, Β."

9542,ARGUMENT.,"meaning, as derived from oaρ) και συναναστρoφη."
9543,ARGUMENT.,
9544,ARGUMENT.,"Thus be spake, and Meriones, equal to swift Mars, quickly took from the"
9545,ARGUMENT.,"tent a brazen spear; and he went along with Idomeneus, very eager for"
9546,ARGUMENT.,"war. But as man-destroying Mars enters the battle—with whom Terror, his"
9547,ARGUMENT.,"dear son, at the same time powerful and undismayed, follows, who"
9548,ARGUMENT.,strikes fear into the warrior even of resolute soul: these indeed are
9549,ARGUMENT.,"armed from Thrace, along with the Ephyri or with the magnanimous"
9550,ARGUMENT.,"Phlegyans; neither do they hear both, but they give glory to one or the"
9551,ARGUMENT.,"other—so Meriones and Idomeneus, leaders of heroes, advanced to battle"
9552,ARGUMENT.,equipped with helmets of glittering brass; and Meriones first addressed
9553,ARGUMENT.,him in these words:
9554,ARGUMENT.,
9555,ARGUMENT.,"“Son of Deucalion, where dost thou meditate to enter the throng? To the"
9556,ARGUMENT.,"right of all the army, or at the centre, or upon the left? Since"
9557,ARGUMENT.,nowhere [else] 421 in the battle do I conceive that the long-haired
9558,ARGUMENT.,Greeks so much require support.”
9559,ARGUMENT.,
9560,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 421: (return)  _I.e._ nowhere so much as on the left.
9561,ARGUMENT.,
9562,ARGUMENT.,"But him Idomeneus, the leader of the Cretans, in turn addressed: “Among"
9563,ARGUMENT.,"the centre ships indeed there are others to aid them, both the Ajaces"
9564,ARGUMENT.,"and Teucer, who is the most skilful of the Greeks in archery, and brave"
9565,ARGUMENT.,"also in standing fight; who will sufficiently harass, even to satiety,"
9566,ARGUMENT.,"Hector, the son of Priam, although most urgent of battle, and although"
9567,ARGUMENT.,"being very gallant. Hard will it be for him, although very desirous of"
9568,ARGUMENT.,"fighting, having overpowered their strength and invincible hands, to"
9569,ARGUMENT.,"fire the ships, unless the son of Saturn himself cast a flaming torch"
9570,ARGUMENT.,upon the swift ships. Nor indeed will mighty Telamonian Ajax yield to
9571,ARGUMENT.,"any man who may be a mortal, and who may eat the fruit of Ceres, who is"
9572,ARGUMENT.,vulnerable by brass and by large stones. Not even to warlike Achilles
9573,ARGUMENT.,"would he give way, at least in standing fight; but in speed he is by no"
9574,ARGUMENT.,"means able to contend with him. Guide us, therefore, to the left of the"
9575,ARGUMENT.,"army that we may quickly know whether we shall afford glory to any one,"
9576,ARGUMENT.,or any one to us.”
9577,ARGUMENT.,
9578,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke. But Meriones, equal to rapid Mars, began to proceed,"
9579,ARGUMENT.,until he came to [that part of] the army whither he had ordered him.
9580,ARGUMENT.,"But they, when they beheld Idomeneus, like unto a flame in might, both"
9581,ARGUMENT.,"him and his attendant, in variously-wrought armour, they all, exhorting"
9582,ARGUMENT.,"one another along the crowd, advanced against him, and an equal contest"
9583,ARGUMENT.,"arose at the sterns of their ships. And as when storms sweep along,"
9584,ARGUMENT.,"[driven] by the shrill winds, on a day when the dust around the roads"
9585,ARGUMENT.,"[is] very abundant, and they at the same time raise up a large cloud of"
9586,ARGUMENT.,"dust; so came on the battle of these together, and they were eager in"
9587,ARGUMENT.,their minds to slaughter one another throughout the throng with the
9588,ARGUMENT.,sharp brass. And the mortal-destroying combat bristles with the long
9589,ARGUMENT.,"spears which they held, flesh-rending; and the brazen splendour from"
9590,ARGUMENT.,"the gleaming helmets, the newly-burnished corslets, and the shining"
9591,ARGUMENT.,"shields, coming together, dazzled their eyes. Very brave-hearted would"
9592,ARGUMENT.,"he be who, when beholding their toil, could have rejoiced, and would"
9593,ARGUMENT.,not be disturbed.
9594,ARGUMENT.,
9595,ARGUMENT.,"But the two powerful sons of Saturn, favouring different sides, planned"
9596,ARGUMENT.,"grievous toils for the heroes. On the one hand, Jove willed victory to"
9597,ARGUMENT.,"the Trojans and to Hector, glorifying swift-footed Achilles; yet he"
9598,ARGUMENT.,"desired not entirely to destroy the Grecian people before Ilium, but"
9599,ARGUMENT.,"was honouring Thetis and her magnanimous son. On the other hand,"
9600,ARGUMENT.,"Neptune, coming amongst them, encouraged the Greeks, having secretly"
9601,ARGUMENT.,emerged from the hoary deep; for he grieved that they should be subdued
9602,ARGUMENT.,"by the Trojans, and he was greatly indignant with Jove. The same race"
9603,ARGUMENT.,"indeed was to both, and the same lineage, but Jove was born first, 422"
9604,ARGUMENT.,"and knew more. For this reason [Neptune] avoided aiding them openly,"
9605,ARGUMENT.,"but always kept privately inciting them through the army, assimilated"
9606,ARGUMENT.,to a man. They indeed alternately stretched over both the cord of
9607,ARGUMENT.,"vehement contest and equally destructive war, irrefragable and"
9608,ARGUMENT.,"indissoluble, which relaxed the knees of many. Then, although"
9609,ARGUMENT.,"half-hoary Idomeneus, encouraging the Greeks, rushing upon the Trojans,"
9610,ARGUMENT.,"created night; for he slew Othryoneus, who had come from Cabesus,"
9611,ARGUMENT.,staying within [Priam’s house]. 423 He had lately come after the rumour
9612,ARGUMENT.,"of the war, and demanded Cassandra, the most beautiful in form of the"
9613,ARGUMENT.,"daughters of Priam, without a dowry; and he had promised a mighty deed,"
9614,ARGUMENT.,to repulse in spite of themselves the sons of the Greeks from Troy. But
9615,ARGUMENT.,"to him aged Priam had promised her, and pledged himself 424 to give"
9616,ARGUMENT.,"her; therefore he fought, trusting in these promises. But Idomeneus"
9617,ARGUMENT.,"took aim at him with his shining spear, and hurling it, struck him,"
9618,ARGUMENT.,"strutting proudly; nor did the brazen corslet which he wore resist it,"
9619,ARGUMENT.,"but he fixed it in the middle of his stomach. And falling, he gave a"
9620,ARGUMENT.,"crash, and [the other] boasted and said:"
9621,ARGUMENT.,
9622,ARGUMENT.,"“Othryoneus! above all men indeed do I praise thee, if thou wilt now in"
9623,ARGUMENT.,truth accomplish all which thou hast undertaken for Dardanian Priam:
9624,ARGUMENT.,"but he also promised thee his daughter. We likewise, promising these"
9625,ARGUMENT.,"things, will accomplish them to thee. We will give thee the most"
9626,ARGUMENT.,"beautiful in form of the daughters of the son of Atreus to wed,"
9627,ARGUMENT.,"bringing her from Argos, if along with us thou wilt destroy the"
9628,ARGUMENT.,"well-inhabited city of Ilium. But follow, that we may treat with thee"
9629,ARGUMENT.,respecting the marriage of the sea-traversing ships; since we are by no
9630,ARGUMENT.,means bad brothers-in-law.”

9639,ARGUMENT.,
9640,ARGUMENT.,"So saying, the hero Idomeneus dragged him by the foot through the brisk"
9641,ARGUMENT.,"battle. But to him Asius came as an avenger, on foot, before his"
9642,ARGUMENT.,steeds; which his attendant charioteer always kept breathing over his
9643,ARGUMENT.,"shoulders; 425 and in his mind he longed to strike Idomeneus, but he"
9644,ARGUMENT.,"(Idomeneus) anticipating him, smote him with his spear in the throat,"
9645,ARGUMENT.,"below the chin, and drove the brass quite through. And he fell, as when"
9646,ARGUMENT.,"some oak falls, or white poplar, 426 or towering 427 pine, which"
9647,ARGUMENT.,timber-workers have cut down upon the mountains with lately-whetted
9648,ARGUMENT.,"axes, to become ship timber. So he lay, stretched out before his horses"
9649,ARGUMENT.,"and chariot, gnashing his teeth, grasping the bloody dust. But the"
9650,ARGUMENT.,"charioteer was deprived of the senses which he previously had, nor"
9651,ARGUMENT.,dared he turn back the horses that he might escape from the hands of
9652,ARGUMENT.,"the enemy: but him warlike Antilochus, striking, transfixed in the"
9653,ARGUMENT.,"middle with his spear; nor did the brazen corslet which he wore resist,"
9654,ARGUMENT.,"but he fixed it in the centre of his stomach. Then, panting, he fell"
9655,ARGUMENT.,"from the well-made chariot-seat, and Antilochus, the son of magnanimous"
9656,ARGUMENT.,"Nestor, drove away the horses from the Trojans to the well-armed"
9657,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks. But Deïphobus, enraged on account of Asius, drew very near to"
9658,ARGUMENT.,"Idomeneus, and hurled with his shining spear. Idomeneus, however,"
9659,ARGUMENT.,"having perceived it opposite, avoided the brazen spear, for he was"
9660,ARGUMENT.,"concealed behind his shield equal on all sides, which he bore,"
9661,ARGUMENT.,"constructed of the hides of bulls, and glittering brass, fitted with"
9662,ARGUMENT.,"two handles. Behind this he collected himself entirely, and the brazen"

9664,ARGUMENT.,grazing it obliquely. Yet he (Deïphobus) sent it not in vain from his
9665,ARGUMENT.,"heavy hand, but he struck Hypsenor, son of Hippasus. the shepherd of"
9666,ARGUMENT.,"the people, upon the liver, below the breast, and straightway relaxed"
9667,ARGUMENT.,"his knees under him. But Deïphobus vainly boasted over him, loudly"

9687,ARGUMENT.,
9688,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but grief came upon the Greeks at his boasting, and it"
9689,ARGUMENT.,"particularly agitated the mind of warlike Antilochus. Yet, grieved as"
9690,ARGUMENT.,"he was, he neglected not his companion, but running, he protected him,"
9691,ARGUMENT.,"and covered him over with his shield. Him then his two dear companions,"
9692,ARGUMENT.,"Mecisteus, son of Echius, and noble Alastor, supporting, bore to the"
9693,ARGUMENT.,"hollow ships, deeply groaning. In the meantime Idomeneus ceased not his"
9694,ARGUMENT.,mighty valour; but always burned either to cover some of the Trojans
9695,ARGUMENT.,"with pitchy night, 429 or himself to fall with a crash, repelling"
9696,ARGUMENT.,"destruction from the Greeks. Then the hero Alcathous, the beloved son"
9697,ARGUMENT.,"of Æsyetas (and he was the son-in-law of Anchises, for he had married"
9698,ARGUMENT.,"Hippodamia, the eldest of his daughters, whom her father and venerable"
9699,ARGUMENT.,"mother loved from their hearts, whilst in their home, because she"
9700,ARGUMENT.,"excelled all of her age in beauty, in accomplishments, and prudence,"
9701,ARGUMENT.,for which reason also the most distinguished man in wide Troy had
9702,ARGUMENT.,"wedded her), him Neptune subdued under Idomeneus, having dimmed his"
9703,ARGUMENT.,"shining eyes, and fettered his fair limbs. For he was able neither to"
9704,ARGUMENT.,"fly back nor to turn aside, but him, standing motionless, like a pillar"
9705,ARGUMENT.,"or lofty-branching tree, the hero Idomeneus wounded with his spear in"
9706,ARGUMENT.,"the middle of the breast, and burst the brazen coat around him, which"
9707,ARGUMENT.,formerly warded off destruction from his body: but then it sent forth a
9708,ARGUMENT.,"dry sound, severed by the spear. Falling, he gave a crash, and the"
9709,ARGUMENT.,"spear was fixed in his heart, which, palpitating, shook even the"
9710,ARGUMENT.,extremity of the spear; and there at length the impetuous Mars 430
9711,ARGUMENT.,"spent its force. But Idomeneus boasted prodigiously over him, loudly"
9712,ARGUMENT.,exclaiming:

9717,ARGUMENT.,
9718,ARGUMENT.,"“Deïphobus! do we judge rightly that it is a fair return, that three"
9719,ARGUMENT.,"should be slain for one, since thus thou boastest? But do thou thyself"
9720,ARGUMENT.,"also, wretch, stand against me, that thou mayest know of what nature I"
9721,ARGUMENT.,"am, who have come hither the offspring of Jove, who first begat Minos,"
9722,ARGUMENT.,"the guardian of Crete. Minos again begat Deucalion, his blameless son,"
9723,ARGUMENT.,"and Deucalion begat me, king over many men in wide Crete. But now the"
9724,ARGUMENT.,"ships have brought me hither, an evil both to thee and to thy father,"
9725,ARGUMENT.,and the other Trojans.”
9726,ARGUMENT.,
9727,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke, but Deïphobus hesitated between two opinions, whether,"
9728,ARGUMENT.,"falling back, he should join to himself some one of the magnanimous"
9729,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans, or make trial although alone. But to him, thus deliberating,"
9730,ARGUMENT.,it appeared preferable to go in search of Æneas; whom he found standing
9731,ARGUMENT.,"at the rear of the army, for he was ever indignant with noble Priam,"
9732,ARGUMENT.,"because he by no means honoured him, though being valiant among heroes."
9733,ARGUMENT.,"And, standing near, he addressed to him winged words:"
9734,ARGUMENT.,
9735,ARGUMENT.,"“Æneas, thou counsellor of the Trojans, now does it greatly behove thee"
9736,ARGUMENT.,"to aid thy brother-in-law, if indeed any regard reaches thee. But"
9737,ARGUMENT.,"follow, let us bring aid to Alcathous, who, being thy brother-in-law,"
9738,ARGUMENT.,"nourished thee whilst very young, in his palace, and whom spear-famed"
9739,ARGUMENT.,Idomeneus hath slain.”
9740,ARGUMENT.,
9741,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke, and roused the courage in his breast, and he, greatly"
9742,ARGUMENT.,"desirous of battle, went to meet Idomeneus. Yet fear seized not"
9743,ARGUMENT.,"Idomeneus like a tender boy, but he stood still, like a boar in the"
9744,ARGUMENT.,"mountains, confident in his prowess, and who abides the mighty din of"
9745,ARGUMENT.,"men advancing against him, in a desert place, 431 and bristles up his"
9746,ARGUMENT.,"back; his eyes, too, gleam with fire, and he whets his teeth, eager to"
9747,ARGUMENT.,keep at bay both dogs and men. So spear-renowned Idomeneus awaited
9748,ARGUMENT.,"Æneas, swift in the battle-din, coming against him, nor retired; but he"
9749,ARGUMENT.,"shouted to his companions, looking to Ascalaphus, and Aphareus, and"
9750,ARGUMENT.,"Deïpyrus, and Meriones, and Antilochus, skilful in fight. Exhorting"
9751,ARGUMENT.,"these, he addressed to them winged words:"
9752,ARGUMENT.,
9753,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 431: (return)  Or, “in the sheep-pasture.”"
9754,ARGUMENT.,
9755,ARGUMENT.,"“Hither, my friends, and aid me alone, for I greatly dread swift-footed"
9756,ARGUMENT.,"Æneas, rushing on, who is coming upon me; who is very powerful to slay"
9757,ARGUMENT.,"men in battle, and possesses the bloom of youth, which is the greatest"
9758,ARGUMENT.,"strength. For if we were of the same age, with the spirit that I now"
9759,ARGUMENT.,"possess, quickly would either he bear off great glory, or I would.”"
9760,ARGUMENT.,
9761,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but they all, having one determination in their minds,"
9762,ARGUMENT.,"stood near him, inclining their shields upon their shoulders. Æneas, on"
9763,ARGUMENT.,"the other hand, animated his companions, looking towards Deïphobus,"
9764,ARGUMENT.,"Paris, and noble Agenor, who, together with himself, were leaders of"
9765,ARGUMENT.,"the Trojans. These also the people followed, as sheep follow from their"
9766,ARGUMENT.,pasture after the ram in order to drink; and the shepherd then is
9767,ARGUMENT.,"rejoiced in his mind. So was the soul of Æneas gladdened in his breast,"
9768,ARGUMENT.,when he beheld a body of troops following himself. These therefore
9769,ARGUMENT.,"engaged in close fight round Alcathous with long spears, whilst the"
9770,ARGUMENT.,"brass resounded horribly on the breasts of them, aiming at each other"
9771,ARGUMENT.,"through the crowd. But two warlike men, conspicuous among the rest,"
9772,ARGUMENT.,"Æneas and Idomeneus, equal to Mars, longed to lacerate each other’s"
9773,ARGUMENT.,flesh with the ruthless brass. But Æneas first hurled his javelin at
9774,ARGUMENT.,"Idomeneus; but he, perceiving it opposite, avoided the brazen spear;"
9775,ARGUMENT.,and the spear of Æneas sank quivering into the earth; for it fled in
9776,ARGUMENT.,vain from his sturdy hand. Idomeneus next smote Œnomaus in the middle
9777,ARGUMENT.,"of the stomach, and the spear burst the cavity of his corslet, and"
9778,ARGUMENT.,"penetrating, drank his entrails through; but falling amid the dust, he"
9779,ARGUMENT.,grasped the earth with the hollow of his hand. Then Idomeneus plucked
9780,ARGUMENT.,"out the long spear from his body, but was unable to tear off the other"
9781,ARGUMENT.,"rich armour from his shoulders, for he was pressed hard by weapons. For"
9782,ARGUMENT.,"no longer were the sinews of his feet firm as he rushed, either to"
9783,ARGUMENT.,"hasten on after his own dart, 432 or avoid [that of another]. Wherefore"
9784,ARGUMENT.,"also in standing fight, he warded off the fatal day, nor did his feet"
9785,ARGUMENT.,any longer bear him with ease in retreating from the battle. But
9786,ARGUMENT.,"against him, gradually retiring, Deïphobus took aim with his glittering"
9787,ARGUMENT.,"spear, for he ever had a rooted hatred towards him. But then too he"
9788,ARGUMENT.,"missed, and struck with his javelin Ascalaphus, the son of Mars, and"
9789,ARGUMENT.,"drove the stout spear through his shoulder; and tailing amid the dust,"
9790,ARGUMENT.,he grasped the earth with his hand.
9791,ARGUMENT.,
9792,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 432: (return)  So as to recover it.
9793,ARGUMENT.,
9794,ARGUMENT.,"Not yet, however, had loudly-roaring, 433 impetuous Mars heard that his"
9795,ARGUMENT.,son had fallen in the violent fight; but he sat upon the summit of
9796,ARGUMENT.,"Olympus, beneath golden clouds, excluded [from the battle] by the will"
9797,ARGUMENT.,"of Jove, where also the other immortal gods were restrained from the"
9798,ARGUMENT.,war. In the meantime they engaged in close fight round Ascalaphus.
9799,ARGUMENT.,"Deïphobus indeed tore the shining helmet from Ascalaphus; and Meriones,"
9800,ARGUMENT.,"equal to swift Mars, springing [upon him], smote [him] with his spear"
9801,ARGUMENT.,"in the arm, and the crested 434 casque, falling from his hand, rang"
9802,ARGUMENT.,"upon the earth. Immediately Meriones, leaping upon him like a vulture,"
9803,ARGUMENT.,"plucked out the tough spear from the lower part of his arm, and retired"
9804,ARGUMENT.,"back again into the crowd of his comrades. But him Polites, his own"
9805,ARGUMENT.,"brother, throwing his hands round his waist, carried out of the"
9806,ARGUMENT.,"dread-sounding battle, till he reached his fleet steeds, which awaited"
9807,ARGUMENT.,"him in the rear of the combat and the war, having both a charioteer and"
9808,ARGUMENT.,"a variegated car; which then carried him towards the city, groaning"
9809,ARGUMENT.,heavily [and] afflicted; and the blood flowed from his recently-wounded
9810,ARGUMENT.,"hand: but the others kept fighting, and an unquenchable clamour arose."
9811,ARGUMENT.,"Then Æneas rushing upon Aphareus, the son of Caletor, smote him with"
9812,ARGUMENT.,"his sharp spear upon the throat, when turned towards him. And his head"
9813,ARGUMENT.,"was bent to one side, then his shield clung to him, and his helmet; and"
9814,ARGUMENT.,"around him life-destroying death was spread. Antilochus, however,"
9815,ARGUMENT.,"observing Thoas turning around, attacking, wounded him; and cut away"
9816,ARGUMENT.,"all the vein, which, running quite along the back, reaches to the neck."
9817,ARGUMENT.,"All this he cut off; but he fell on his back in the dust, stretching"
9818,ARGUMENT.,out both hands to his beloved companions. Then Antilochus sprang upon
9819,ARGUMENT.,"him, and stripped the armour from his shoulders, looking around; for"
9820,ARGUMENT.,"the Trojans surrounding him, struck his wide and ornamented shield with"
9821,ARGUMENT.,"their darts, nor were they able to graze with the dire brass the tender"
9822,ARGUMENT.,body of Antilochus within it; because earth-shaking Neptune protected
9823,ARGUMENT.,"the son of Nestor all round, even amongst many weapons. For never"
9824,ARGUMENT.,"indeed was he apart from the enemy, but he turned himself about among"
9825,ARGUMENT.,"them: nor did he hold his spear without motion, but continually moving,"
9826,ARGUMENT.,"it was whirled about; and he prepared within his mind, either to hurl"
9827,ARGUMENT.,"it at some one afar off, or to rush upon some one close at hand. But"
9828,ARGUMENT.,"meditating these things amid the throng, he escaped not the notice of"
9829,ARGUMENT.,"Adamas, the son of Asias, who smote him in the middle of his shield"
9830,ARGUMENT.,"with the sharp brass, attacking him in close combat; but azure-haired"
9831,ARGUMENT.,"Neptune weakened the spear, grudging 435 him the life [of Antilochus]."
9832,ARGUMENT.,"Part of it remained there, like a stake burned in the fire, 436 in the"
9833,ARGUMENT.,"shield of Antilochus, and the other half lay upon the ground; whilst he"
9834,ARGUMENT.,"gave backwards into the crowd of his companions, shunning death."
9835,ARGUMENT.,"Meriones, however, following him departing, smote him with his spear"
9836,ARGUMENT.,"between the private parts and the navel, where a wound 437 is"
9837,ARGUMENT.,particularly painful to miserable mortals. There he fixed the spear in
9838,ARGUMENT.,"him; and he falling, struggled panting around the spear, as an ox, when"
9839,ARGUMENT.,"cowherds in the mountains, forcibly binding him with twisted cords,"
9840,ARGUMENT.,"lead [him] away unwilling. So he, wounded, throbbed, though but for a"
9841,ARGUMENT.,"short time, and not very long, until the hero Meriones coming near,"
9842,ARGUMENT.,plucked the spear from his body; and darkness veiled his eyes. But
9843,ARGUMENT.,"Helenas, close at hand, struck Deïpyrus upon the temple with his huge"
9844,ARGUMENT.,"Thracian sword, and cut away the three-coned helmet; which, being"
9845,ARGUMENT.,"dashed off, fell upon the ground; and some one of the combating Greeks"
9846,ARGUMENT.,"lifted it up, having rolled between his feet; whilst dim night"
9847,ARGUMENT.,"enveloped his eyes. Then grief seized the son of Atreus, Menelaus,"
9848,ARGUMENT.,"brave in the din of battle, and he advanced, threatening the hero, king"
9849,ARGUMENT.,"Helenus; brandishing his sharp spear, whilst the other drew the horn of"
9850,ARGUMENT.,"his bow. Together then they darted, the one eager to launch his"
9851,ARGUMENT.,"fir-tree spear, and the other an arrow from the string. Then indeed the"
9852,ARGUMENT.,"son of Priam smote him in the breast with an arrow, on the cavity of"
9853,ARGUMENT.,"the corslet, but the bitter shaft rebounded. As when from the broad"
9854,ARGUMENT.,"winnowing-fan in a large threshing-floor, the black-coated beans or"
9855,ARGUMENT.,"vetches leap at the shrill blast, and the force of the winnower; so,"
9856,ARGUMENT.,"strongly repulsed by the corslet of glorious Menelaus, the bitter arrow"
9857,ARGUMENT.,"flew afar. But Menelaus, the son of Atreus, brave in the din of battle,"
9858,ARGUMENT.,smote him upon the hand which held his well-polished bow; and in the
9859,ARGUMENT.,"bow the brazen spear was fixed from the opposite side, through his"
9860,ARGUMENT.,"hand. Then he retired back into the crowd of his companions, avoiding"
9861,ARGUMENT.,"death, hanging down his hand at his side, but the ashen spear was"
9862,ARGUMENT.,trailed along with him. And then magnanimous Agenor extracted it from
9863,ARGUMENT.,"his hand, and bound [the hand] itself sling-ways in well-twisted"
9864,ARGUMENT.,"sheep’s wool, which his attendant carried for the shepherd of the"
9865,ARGUMENT.,people.

9891,ARGUMENT.,"the dire battle. When therefore they were near, advancing against each"
9892,ARGUMENT.,"other, the son of Atreus indeed missed, and his spear was turned aside"
9893,ARGUMENT.,"from him; but Pisander smote the shield of glorious Menelaus, nor could"
9894,ARGUMENT.,"he drive the spear quite through; because the broad shield kept it off,"
9895,ARGUMENT.,and the spear was broken at the extremity: still he rejoiced in his
9896,ARGUMENT.,"mind, and hoped for victory. The son of Atreus, however, drawing his"
9897,ARGUMENT.,"silver-studded sword, sprang upon Pisander; but he drew from beneath"
9898,ARGUMENT.,"his shield a handsome battle-axe of well-wrought brass, fixed upon"
9899,ARGUMENT.,"either side of an olive handle, long, well-polished; and at once they"
9900,ARGUMENT.,"struck each other. Then he (Pisander) cut away the cone of the helmet,"
9901,ARGUMENT.,"thick with horse-hair, under the very crest, but (Menelaus smote) him,"
9902,ARGUMENT.,"approaching, upon the forehead, above the root of the nose. And the"
9903,ARGUMENT.,"bones crashed, and his blood-stained eyes fell at his feet upon the"
9904,ARGUMENT.,"ground in the dust: and falling, he writhed. Then he (Menelaus) placing"
9905,ARGUMENT.,"his heel upon his breast, despoiled him of his armour, and boasting,"
9906,ARGUMENT.,spoke [this] speech:
9907,ARGUMENT.,
9908,ARGUMENT.,"“Thus, 438 then, shall ye abandon the ships of the Greeks, who possess"
9909,ARGUMENT.,"swift steeds, ye treaty-breaking Trojans, insatiate of dire battle. Of"
9910,ARGUMENT.,other injury and disgrace ye indeed lack nothing with which ye have
9911,ARGUMENT.,"injured me, vile dogs, nor have ye at all dreaded in your minds the"
9912,ARGUMENT.,"heavy wrath of high-thundering, hospitable Jove, who will yet destroy"
9913,ARGUMENT.,"for you your lofty city; ye who unprovoked departed, carrying off my"
9914,ARGUMENT.,"virgin spouse, and much wealth, after ye had been hospitably received"
9915,ARGUMENT.,by her. Now again do ye eagerly desire to hurl destructive fire upon
9916,ARGUMENT.,"the sea-traversing ships, and to slay the Grecian heroes. But ye shall"
9917,ARGUMENT.,"yet be restrained, impetuous as ye be, from war. O father Jove,"
9918,ARGUMENT.,"assuredly they say that thou excellest all others, men and gods, in"
9919,ARGUMENT.,"prudence, yet from thee do all these things proceed. How much dost thou"
9920,ARGUMENT.,"gratify these insolent Trojan men, whose violence is ever pernicious,"
9921,ARGUMENT.,"and who cannot be satisfied with war, equally destructive to all! Of"
9922,ARGUMENT.,"all things is there satiety,—of sleep, of love, of sweet singing, and"
9923,ARGUMENT.,"of faultless dancing, with which one would much more readily satisfy"
9924,ARGUMENT.,"his desire, than with war; but the Trojans are insatiate of battle.”"

9927,ARGUMENT.,
9928,ARGUMENT.,"So saying, having stripped the bloody armour from the body, illustrious"
9929,ARGUMENT.,"Menelaus gave it to his companions, whilst he, advancing, was again"
9930,ARGUMENT.,"mixed with the foremost combatants. Then Harpalion, the son of king"
9931,ARGUMENT.,"Pylæmenes, who had then followed his dear father to wage war at Troy,"
9932,ARGUMENT.,leaped upon him; nor returned he back to his native land. [He it was]
9933,ARGUMENT.,"who then, close at hand, struck the middle of Atrides’ shield with his"
9934,ARGUMENT.,"lance, nor was he able to drive quite through the brass; but he retired"
9935,ARGUMENT.,"back into the crowd of his companions, avoiding death, looking around"
9936,ARGUMENT.,"on all sides, lest any one should touch his body 439 with a spear."
9937,ARGUMENT.,"Meriones, however, shot a brazen-pointed arrow at him retreating, and"
9938,ARGUMENT.,"struck him upon the right hip, and the arrow penetrated to the other"
9939,ARGUMENT.,"side, through the bladder, below the bone. Sinking down, therefore, in"
9940,ARGUMENT.,"the same place, breathing out his life in the arms of his beloved"
9941,ARGUMENT.,"companions, like a worm, he lay stretched upon the ground, whilst his"
9942,ARGUMENT.,"black blood flowed, and moistened the earth. Around him the magnanimous"
9943,ARGUMENT.,"Paphlagonians were employed, and, lifting him upon a chariot, they bore"
9944,ARGUMENT.,"him to sacred Ilium, grieving; and with them went his father, shedding"
9945,ARGUMENT.,tears: but no vengeance was taken for his dead son.

9949,ARGUMENT.,
9950,ARGUMENT.,But Paris was greatly enraged in his soul on account of his being
9951,ARGUMENT.,"slain, for he had been his guest among many Paphlagonians; wherefore,"
9952,ARGUMENT.,"enraged on his account, he sent forth a brazen arrow. Now there was one"
9953,ARGUMENT.,"Euchenor, son of the diviner Polyïdus, wealthy and brave, inhabiting a"
9954,ARGUMENT.,"dwelling at Corinth, who, well knowing his fatal destiny, had arrived"
9955,ARGUMENT.,"in a ship. For often had Polyïdus, good old man, told him, that he"
9956,ARGUMENT.,"would perish in his halls of a grievous disease, or be subdued by the"
9957,ARGUMENT.,Trojans among the ships of the Greeks; wherefore he avoided at once the
9958,ARGUMENT.,"severe mulct 440 of the Achæans, and odious disease, that he might not"
9959,ARGUMENT.,suffer sorrows in his mind. Him he (Paris) smote below the jaw and the
9960,ARGUMENT.,"ear; and his spirit quickly departed from his members, and hateful"
9961,ARGUMENT.,darkness seized him.
9962,ARGUMENT.,
9963,ARGUMENT.,"Thus indeed they fought like 441 unto a burning fire. But Hector, dear"
9964,ARGUMENT.,"to Jove, had not learned, nor knew at all, how at the left of the ships"
9965,ARGUMENT.,"his people were being slaughtered by the Greeks, for the victory was on"
9966,ARGUMENT.,the point of being the Grecians’; so much did earth-shaking Neptune
9967,ARGUMENT.,"encourage the Greeks, and moreover himself assisted with his strength;"
9968,ARGUMENT.,but he (Hector) pressed on where first he had sprung within the gates
9969,ARGUMENT.,"and wall, breaking the thick ranks of the shielded Greeks. There were"
9970,ARGUMENT.,"the ships of Ajax and Protesilaus, drawn up upon the shore of the hoary"
9971,ARGUMENT.,sea; but above 442 them the wall was built very low; there themselves
9972,ARGUMENT.,and their horses were most impetuous in the combat. There 443 the
9973,ARGUMENT.,"Bœotians and long-robed Iaonians, the Locrians, the Phthians, and the"
9974,ARGUMENT.,"illustrious Epeans, restrained him from the ships, fiercely rushing on;"
9975,ARGUMENT.,"but were unable to drive away from them noble Hector, like unto a"
9976,ARGUMENT.,flame. The chosen men of the Athenians stood in the van; among whom
9977,ARGUMENT.,"Menestheus, son of Peteus, had the command; and with him followed"
9978,ARGUMENT.,"Phidas, Stichius, and brave Bias, Meges, the son of Phyieus, Amphion,"
9979,ARGUMENT.,"and Dracius, led the Epeans, and over the Phthians were Medon and"
9980,ARGUMENT.,"Podarces, steady in fight (Medon indeed was the spurious offspring of"

10003,ARGUMENT.,meanwhile copious sweat breaks forth around the roots of their horns;
10004,ARGUMENT.,"and them the well-polished yoke alone separates on either side,"
10005,ARGUMENT.,"advancing along the furrows, and [the plough] cuts 445 up the bottom of"
10006,ARGUMENT.,"the soil; so they twain, joined together, stood very near to each"
10007,ARGUMENT.,other. And then many and brave troops followed the son of Telamon as
10008,ARGUMENT.,"companions, who received from him his shield, whenever fatigue and"
10009,ARGUMENT.,sweat came upon his limbs. But the Locrians followed not the
10010,ARGUMENT.,"great-souled son of Oïleus, for their heart remained not firm to them"
10011,ARGUMENT.,"in the standing fight, because they had not brazen helmets crested with"
10012,ARGUMENT.,"horse-hair, nor had they well-orbed shields and ashen spears; but they"
10013,ARGUMENT.,"followed along with him to Ilium, trusting in the bows and the"
10014,ARGUMENT.,"well-twisted sheep’s wool, with which, frequently hurling, they broke"
10015,ARGUMENT.,the phalanxes of the Trojans. At that time indeed these (the Ajaces) in
10016,ARGUMENT.,"the van, with their variously-wrought armour, fought against the"
10017,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans and brazen-armed Hector, whilst (the Locrians) shooting from"
10018,ARGUMENT.,"the rear, lay concealed; nor were the Trojans any longer mindful of"
10019,ARGUMENT.,"combat, for the arrows put them in confusion."
10020,ARGUMENT.,
10021,ARGUMENT.,Then surely would the Trojans have retreated with loss from the ships
10022,ARGUMENT.,"and tents to lofty Ilium, had not Polydamas, standing near, addressed"
10023,ARGUMENT.,bold Hector:
10024,ARGUMENT.,
10025,ARGUMENT.,"“Hector, thou art impossible to be persuaded by advice. 446 Because"
10026,ARGUMENT.,"indeed a god hath given thee, above others, warlike deeds, for this"
10027,ARGUMENT.,reason dost thou also desire to be more skilled than others in counsel?
10028,ARGUMENT.,But by no means canst thou thyself obtain all things at once. 447 To
10029,ARGUMENT.,one indeed hath the deity given warlike deeds; to another dancing; and
10030,ARGUMENT.,to another the harp and singing. To another again far-sounding Jove
10031,ARGUMENT.,"implants a prudent mind in his bosom, of which many men reap the"
10032,ARGUMENT.,"advantage, as it (prudence) even preserves cities; and he himself (who"
10033,ARGUMENT.,possesses it) especially knows (its value). Yet will I speak as appears
10034,ARGUMENT.,to me best; because the encircling host 448 of war burns round thee on
10035,ARGUMENT.,"all sides, and the magnanimous Trojans, since they have crossed the"
10036,ARGUMENT.,"walls, some indeed stand apart with their arms, and others fight, the"
10037,ARGUMENT.,"fewer against the greater number, scattered amongst the ships. But"
10038,ARGUMENT.,"retiring back, summon hither all the chiefs. And then we can better"
10039,ARGUMENT.,discuss the whole plan; whether we shall enter upon the many-benched
10040,ARGUMENT.,"ships, if indeed the deity will give us victory; or depart uninjured"
10041,ARGUMENT.,from the barks; because of a truth I fear lest the Greeks repay their
10042,ARGUMENT.,"debt of yesterday, since a man, insatiate in war, still remains at the"
10043,ARGUMENT.,"ships, who I conceive will no longer abstain entirely from battle.”"
10044,ARGUMENT.,"Thus spoke Polydamas, but the faultless advice pleased Hector; and"
10045,ARGUMENT.,"immediately he leaped with his armour from his chariot to the ground,"
10046,ARGUMENT.,"and, addressing him, spoke winged words:"

10059,ARGUMENT.,"[troops].” He said, and shouting, he rushed on, like unto a snowy"
10060,ARGUMENT.,"mountain, and flew through the Trojans and the allies. But they all"
10061,ARGUMENT.,"crowded round valour-loving Polydamas, the son of Panthous, as soon as"
10062,ARGUMENT.,"they heard the voice of Hector. He, however, ranged through the"
10063,ARGUMENT.,"foremost combatants, seeking if he could anywhere find Deïphobus, the"
10064,ARGUMENT.,"might of king Helenus, and Adamas, the son of Asias, and Asius, the son"
10065,ARGUMENT.,"of Hyrtacus. Some he found no longer quite unhurt, nor yet destroyed,"
10066,ARGUMENT.,"whilst others again lay at the sterns of the ships of the Greeks,"
10067,ARGUMENT.,having lost their lives by the hands of the Greeks; and others were
10068,ARGUMENT.,stricken or wounded within the wall. But he quickly found noble
10069,ARGUMENT.,"Alexander, the husband of fair-haired Helen, on the left of the"
10070,ARGUMENT.,"lamentable battle, cheering of his companions, and encouraging them to"
10071,ARGUMENT.,"fight; and, standing near, he addressed him with reproachful words:"
10072,ARGUMENT.,
10073,ARGUMENT.,"“Accursed Paris, fine only in person, woman-mad, seducer, where are"
10074,ARGUMENT.,"Deïphobus and the might of king Helenus, and Adamas, the son of Asias,"
10075,ARGUMENT.,"and Asius, the son of Hyrtacus? Where also is Othryoneus? Now lofty"
10076,ARGUMENT.,"Ilium all perishes from its summit, 449 now is its final destruction"
10077,ARGUMENT.,certain.”

10083,ARGUMENT.,"intention to find fault with me when innocent, at some other time"
10084,ARGUMENT.,"perhaps, I may be more neglectful of the fight; [but not now], since"
10085,ARGUMENT.,neither did my mother bear me altogether unwarlike. For from the time
10086,ARGUMENT.,"when thou didst stir up the battle of thy companions at the ships, from"
10087,ARGUMENT.,"that time, remaining here, have we engaged incessantly with the Greeks;"
10088,ARGUMENT.,and those comrades are dead for whom thou inquirest. Deïphobus and the
10089,ARGUMENT.,"might of king Helenus alone have withdrawn, both wounded in the hand"
10090,ARGUMENT.,with long spears; but the son of Saturn hath warded off death [from
10091,ARGUMENT.,"them]. But now lead on, wheresoever thy heart and soul urge thee; and"
10092,ARGUMENT.,"we will follow with determined minds, nor do I think that thou wilt be"
10093,ARGUMENT.,"at all in want of valour, as much strength as is in us. It is not"
10094,ARGUMENT.,"possible even for one, although keenly desirous, to fight beyond his"
10095,ARGUMENT.,strength.”
10096,ARGUMENT.,
10097,ARGUMENT.,"So saying, the hero persuaded the mind of his brother, and they"
10098,ARGUMENT.,hastened to advance towards that place where especially was the battle
10099,ARGUMENT.,"and contest; round Cebriones and excellent Polydamas, Phalces and"
10100,ARGUMENT.,"Orthæus, and godlike Polyphœtes, and Palmys, and Ascanius and Morys,"
10101,ARGUMENT.,"the sons of Hippotion, who the day before had come as a relief guard"
10102,ARGUMENT.,450 from fertile Ascania: and Jove then urged them to fight. But they
10103,ARGUMENT.,"marched like unto the blast of boisterous winds, which rushes down to"
10104,ARGUMENT.,"the plain, urged by the thunder of father Jove, and with a dreadful"
10105,ARGUMENT.,tumult 451 is mingled with the ocean; and in it [rise] many boiling

10119,ARGUMENT.,"before him his shield, equal on all sides, thick with skins; and much"

10122,ARGUMENT.,"if perchance they would give way to him, advancing under cover of his"
10123,ARGUMENT.,shield. Yet he disturbed not the courage of the Greeks in their
10124,ARGUMENT.,"breasts: but Ajax, far-striding, first challenged him:"
10125,ARGUMENT.,
10126,ARGUMENT.,"“O noble Sir, draw nearer: why dost thou thus frighten the Greeks? We"
10127,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks are by no means unskilful in battle, although we are subdued by"
10128,ARGUMENT.,"the evil scourge 452 of Jove. Thy soul, forsooth, hopes, I suppose, to"
10129,ARGUMENT.,plunder the ships; but we also have hands ready to repulse thee
10130,ARGUMENT.,"immediately. Assuredly, long before shall thy well-inhabited city be"
10131,ARGUMENT.,"taken and destroyed by our hands. But to thee thyself, I say, the time"
10132,ARGUMENT.,"draws near, when, flying, thou shalt pray to father Jove and the other"
10133,ARGUMENT.,"immortals, that thy fair-maned steeds, which shall bear thee to the"
10134,ARGUMENT.,"city, raising dust over the plain, may become swifter than hawks.”"

10137,ARGUMENT.,
10138,ARGUMENT.,"Whilst he was thus speaking, a bird flew over him on the right—a"
10139,ARGUMENT.,"lofty-flying eagle; upon which the people of the Greeks shouted,"
10140,ARGUMENT.,encouraged by the omen; but illustrious Hector replied:
10141,ARGUMENT.,
10142,ARGUMENT.,"“O babbling and vain-boasting Ajax, what hast thou said? Would that I"
10143,ARGUMENT.,"were as sure of becoming for ever the child of ægis-bearing Jove, that"
10144,ARGUMENT.,"the venerable Juno had borne me, and that I were honoured as Minerva"
10145,ARGUMENT.,"and Apollo are honoured, as that this day now certainly brings"
10146,ARGUMENT.,"destruction upon all the Greeks; and among others thou shalt be slain,"
10147,ARGUMENT.,"if thou wilt dare to abide my long spear, which shall tear for thee thy"
10148,ARGUMENT.,"dainty person, and thou shalt satiate the dogs and birds of the Trojans"
10149,ARGUMENT.,"with thy fat and flesh, falling at the ships of the Greeks.”"
10150,ARGUMENT.,
10151,ARGUMENT.,"Thus then having spoken, he led on; and they followed along with him"
10152,ARGUMENT.,"with a mighty shout, and the troops likewise shouted in the rear. The"
10153,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks, on the other side, raised a shout, nor were they forgetful of"
10154,ARGUMENT.,"their valour, but they awaited the bravest of the Trojans, assaulting."
10155,ARGUMENT.,But the clamour of both reached to the æther and the shining splendour

10188,ARGUMENT.,"deed,—these [the Greeks] in confusion, and those, the haughty Trojans,"
10189,ARGUMENT.,routing them in the rear; but the wall of the Greeks had fallen. And as

10192,ARGUMENT.,"rolled forwards or backwards, before some decisive blast comes down"

10195,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks, or to Agamemnon, the son of Atreus, shepherd of the people. But"
10196,ARGUMENT.,"to him thus reflecting, it appeared better to go in quest of the son of"
10197,ARGUMENT.,"Atreus. Meanwhile they kept slaughtering each other, contending, and"
10198,ARGUMENT.,"the solid brass around their bodies rang, as they were stricken with"
10199,ARGUMENT.,the swords and two-edged spears.

10204,ARGUMENT.,
10205,ARGUMENT.,"But the Jove-cherished kings, coming up from the vessels, met Nestor,"
10206,ARGUMENT.,"as many as had been wounded with the brass,—Tydides, and Ulysses, and"
10207,ARGUMENT.,"Agamemnon, the son of Atreus. Their ships indeed were drawn up upon the"
10208,ARGUMENT.,"shore of the hoary deep, very far away from the battle; for they had"
10209,ARGUMENT.,"drawn the first as far as the plain, and had built a wall at their"
10210,ARGUMENT.,"sterns. For, broad as it was, the shore was by no means able to contain"
10211,ARGUMENT.,"their vessels, and the people were crowded. Wherefore they drew them up"
10212,ARGUMENT.,"in rows one behind the other, and filled the wide mouth of the whole"
10213,ARGUMENT.,"shore, as much as the promontories enclosed. There then were they"
10214,ARGUMENT.,"walking together, leaning upon the spear, in order to behold the tumult"
10215,ARGUMENT.,and the battle; and the heart in their bosoms was grieved. But aged
10216,ARGUMENT.,"Nestor met them, and terrified the souls in the breasts of the Greeks:"
10217,ARGUMENT.,"whom first king Agamemnon addressing, said:"
10218,ARGUMENT.,
10219,ARGUMENT.,"“O Neleïan Nestor, great glory of the Greeks, why, leaving the"
10220,ARGUMENT.,"man-destroying battle, comest thou hither? Truly I fear lest impetuous"
10221,ARGUMENT.,"Hector make good his speech, as once he threatened, haranguing among"
10222,ARGUMENT.,"the Trojans, that he would not return to Ilium from the ships, before"
10223,ARGUMENT.,"that he had burned the ships with fire, and slain us also: thus indeed"
10224,ARGUMENT.,"he harangued; and now are all things fulfilling. Ye gods, surely the"
10225,ARGUMENT.,"other well-greaved Greeks, as well as Achilles, store up wrath against"
10226,ARGUMENT.,me in their minds; nor are they willing to fight at the sterns of the
10227,ARGUMENT.,ships.”
10228,ARGUMENT.,
10229,ARGUMENT.,But him the Gerenian knight Nestor then answered: “Assuredly these
10230,ARGUMENT.,"things are in active accomplishment, nor could even lofty-thundering"
10231,ARGUMENT.,"Jove himself contrive them otherwise; for the wall, in which we trusted"
10232,ARGUMENT.,"that it would be an impregnable defence to the ships and to ourselves,"
10233,ARGUMENT.,has now fallen. But they are sustaining an obstinate contest at the
10234,ARGUMENT.,"swift ships; nor couldst thou any longer distinguish, though examining"
10235,ARGUMENT.,"particularly, on which side the Greeks, confounded, are routed; so"
10236,ARGUMENT.,"promiscuously are they slain, whilst the shout reaches heaven. Let us,"
10237,ARGUMENT.,"however, deliberate how these things will be, if counsel avail"
10238,ARGUMENT.,anything; although I advise not that we enter the battle; for it is by
10239,ARGUMENT.,no means proper that a wounded man should fight.”
10240,ARGUMENT.,
10241,ARGUMENT.,"But him then answered Agamemnon, king of men. “Nestor, since they are"
10242,ARGUMENT.,"combating at the sterns of the ships, and the constructed rampart"
10243,ARGUMENT.,"avails not, nor the ditch, at which the Greeks suffered much, and hoped"
10244,ARGUMENT.,in their minds that it would be an impregnable defence to the ships and
10245,ARGUMENT.,"to themselves, surely it will be agreeable to all-powerful Jove that"
10246,ARGUMENT.,"the Greeks perish here, inglorious, far away from Argos. For I was"
10247,ARGUMENT.,"conscious when he willingly gave assistance to the Greeks, and I now"
10248,ARGUMENT.,"know that he honours those [the Trojans] equally with the happy gods,"
10249,ARGUMENT.,"but hath fettered our courage and our hands. But come, let us all obey"
10250,ARGUMENT.,"as I shall advise. Let us draw down the ships, as many as are drawn up"
10251,ARGUMENT.,"first near the sea, and launch them all into the vast ocean. Let us"
10252,ARGUMENT.,"moor them at anchor in the deep, till mortal-deceiving 455 night"
10253,ARGUMENT.,"arrive, if even then the Trojans may abstain from battle, and then we"
10254,ARGUMENT.,may perhaps draw down all the vessels; for there is no disgrace in
10255,ARGUMENT.,"flying from evil, not even during the night. It is better for a flying"

10266,ARGUMENT.,"worthless army, and not rule over us, to whom Jove hath granted, from"
10267,ARGUMENT.,"youth even unto old age, to accomplish toilsome wars, until we, each of"
10268,ARGUMENT.,"us, shall perish. Dost thou then desire thus to leave wide-wayed Troy,"
10269,ARGUMENT.,"on account of which we have endured so many woes? Be silent, lest some"
10270,ARGUMENT.,"other of the Greeks hear a speech, which a man ought not to have"
10271,ARGUMENT.,"brought through his mouth, whoever understands in his mind how to speak"
10272,ARGUMENT.,"prudent things, who is a sceptre-bearer, and whom so many people obey,"
10273,ARGUMENT.,as many as thou dost govern among the Greeks. For now do I reprobate
10274,ARGUMENT.,"thy judgment, in what thou hast said; who commandest us, whilst the war"
10275,ARGUMENT.,"and battle are waged, to draw down the well-benched ships to the sea,"
10276,ARGUMENT.,"in order that the wishes of the Trojans may be still better fulfilled,"
10277,ARGUMENT.,"victorious though they be, and dire destruction fall upon us: for the"
10278,ARGUMENT.,Greeks will not maintain the fight whilst the ships are being dragged
10279,ARGUMENT.,"to the sea, but will look back, and retire from the combat. Then will"
10280,ARGUMENT.,"thy counsel be injurious, O leader of the people.”"
10281,ARGUMENT.,
10282,ARGUMENT.,"But him Agamemnon, the king of men, then answered: “Much, O Ulysses,"
10283,ARGUMENT.,hast thou touched me to the soul with thy severe reproof; yet I
10284,ARGUMENT.,commanded not the sons of the Greeks against their will to draw the
10285,ARGUMENT.,"well-benched ships down to the sea. But now would that there were one,"
10286,ARGUMENT.,"either young or old, who would deliver an opinion better than this; it"
10287,ARGUMENT.,would be to my joy.” 456
10288,ARGUMENT.,
10289,ARGUMENT.,"But among them Diomede, valiant in the din of battle, also spoke: “The"
10290,ARGUMENT.,"man is near, we need not seek far, if indeed ye are willing to be"
10291,ARGUMENT.,"persuaded; and do not find fault each through wrath, because I am by"
10292,ARGUMENT.,birth the youngest amongst you; for I boast that my race is from a
10293,ARGUMENT.,"noble sire, Tydeus, whom the heaped-up earth 457 covers at Thebes. For"
10294,ARGUMENT.,"to Portheus were born three distinguished sons, and they dwelt in"
10295,ARGUMENT.,"Pleuron and lofty Calydon: Agrius and Melas, but the third was the"
10296,ARGUMENT.,"knight Œneus, the father of my father, who was conspicuous among them"
10297,ARGUMENT.,"for valour. He indeed remained there, but my father, as an exile, dwelt"
10298,ARGUMENT.,"at Argos, for so Jove willed and the other gods. But he married [one]"
10299,ARGUMENT.,"of the daughters 458 of Adrastus, and he inhabited a mansion opulent in"
10300,ARGUMENT.,"resources, and corn-bearing fields were his in abundance, and there"
10301,ARGUMENT.,"were many rows 459 of plants around him. Numerous were his herds, and"

10351,ARGUMENT.,"But golden-throned Juno, standing, looked down with her eyes from the"
10352,ARGUMENT.,"summit of Olympus, and immediately recognized her own brother, [who"
10353,ARGUMENT.,"was] also her brother-in-law, exerting himself through the glorious"
10354,ARGUMENT.,"battle, and she rejoiced in her mind. She also beheld Jove sitting upon"
10355,ARGUMENT.,"the highest top of many-rilled Ida, and he was hateful to her soul."
10356,ARGUMENT.,Then the venerable large-eyed Juno next anxiously considered how she
10357,ARGUMENT.,could beguile the mind of ægis-bearing Jove. And now this plan appeared
10358,ARGUMENT.,"best to her mind, to proceed to Ida, having well arrayed herself, if"
10359,ARGUMENT.,"perchance he might desire to lie beside her form 460 in dalliance, so"
10360,ARGUMENT.,that she might pour upon his eyelids and vigilant mind careless and
10361,ARGUMENT.,"genial sleep. And she proceeded to her chamber, which Vulcan, her dear"
10362,ARGUMENT.,"son, had made for her, and had fitted the thick doors to the lintels"
10363,ARGUMENT.,with a secret bolt; 461 and this no other god could remove. There
10364,ARGUMENT.,"entering in, she closed the shining doors. First she washed all"
10365,ARGUMENT.,"impurities from her lovely person with rich oil, ambrosial, 462 and"
10366,ARGUMENT.,"anointed herself with rich oil, ambrosial and agreeable, 463 which was"
10367,ARGUMENT.,"odoriferous to her; and the perfume of which, when shaken in the"
10368,ARGUMENT.,"brazen-floored 464 mansion of Jove, reached even to earth and to"
10369,ARGUMENT.,"heaven. With this having anointed her body, and having also combed her"
10370,ARGUMENT.,"hair, with her hands she arranged her shining locks, beautiful,"
10371,ARGUMENT.,"ambrosial, [which flowed] from her immortal head. Next she threw around"
10372,ARGUMENT.,"her an ambrosial robe, which Minerva had wrought 465 for her in"
10373,ARGUMENT.,"needlework, and had embroidered much varied work upon it, and she"
10374,ARGUMENT.,fastened it upon her breast with golden clasps. Then she girded herself
10375,ARGUMENT.,"with a zone, adorned with a hundred fringes, and in her well-perforated"
10376,ARGUMENT.,"ears placed her triple-gemmed, elaborate, 466earrings, and much grace"
10377,ARGUMENT.,"shone from [her]. From above she, divine of goddesses, covered herself"
10378,ARGUMENT.,"with a veil, beautiful, newly wrought, and it was bright as the sun;"
10379,ARGUMENT.,and beneath her shining feet she fastened her beautiful sandals. But
10380,ARGUMENT.,"when she had arranged all her ornaments around her person, she"
10381,ARGUMENT.,proceeded straight from her chamber; and having called Venus apart from
10382,ARGUMENT.,"the other gods, addressed her in speech:"

10417,ARGUMENT.,"earth, and Oceanus, the parent of the gods, and mother Tethys; who,"
10418,ARGUMENT.,"receiving me from Rhea, nurtured and educated me with care in their"
10419,ARGUMENT.,"abodes, when far-resounding Jove cast down Saturn beneath the earth and"
10420,ARGUMENT.,"the fruitless sea. These I go to visit, and I will put an end to"
10421,ARGUMENT.,eternal quarrels. 467 For already have they abstained for a length of
10422,ARGUMENT.,"time from the couch and embrace of each other, since anger fell upon"
10423,ARGUMENT.,"their mind. But if, by persuading their hearts by my words, I should"
10424,ARGUMENT.,"lead them back to the bed, to be united in love, then should I always"
10425,ARGUMENT.,be called by them beloved and revered.”

10464,ARGUMENT.,"having passed over Pieria and fertile Emathia, she hastened over the"
10465,ARGUMENT.,"snowy mountains of equestrian Thrace, most lofty summits, nor did she"
10466,ARGUMENT.,touch the ground with her feet. From Athos she descended to the foaming
10467,ARGUMENT.,"deep, and came to Lemnos, the city of divine Thoas, where she met"
10468,ARGUMENT.,"Sleep, the brother of Death; to whose hand she then clung, and spoke,"

10471,ARGUMENT.,"“O Sleep, 470 king of all gods and all men, 471 if ever indeed thou"

10490,ARGUMENT.,"parent of all; but I could not approach Saturnian Jove, nor lull him to"
10491,ARGUMENT.,"sleep, unless, at least, he himself command me. For once already, at"
10492,ARGUMENT.,"least, has he terrified me by his threats, on that day when the"
10493,ARGUMENT.,"magnanimous son of Jove (Hercules) sailed from Ilium, having sacked the"
10494,ARGUMENT.,"city of the Trojans. Then I lulled the mind of ægis-bearing Jove, being"
10495,ARGUMENT.,"poured gently around him, whilst thou wast planning evils in thy mind"
10496,ARGUMENT.,"[against the hero], rousing the blasts of bitter winds over the deep;"
10497,ARGUMENT.,and thou didst afterwards carry him away apart from all his friends to
10498,ARGUMENT.,"well-inhabited Cos. But he, when awakened, was enraged, hurling about"
10499,ARGUMENT.,"the gods through his mansion, and me chiefly of all he sought, and"
10500,ARGUMENT.,"would have cast me down, a lost one, from the æther into the deep, had"
10501,ARGUMENT.,"not Night, vanquisher of gods and men, preserved me, to whom I came"
10502,ARGUMENT.,"flying. So he restrained himself, angry as he was; for he dreaded lest"
10503,ARGUMENT.,he should do things which were disagreeable to swift 472 Night. And now
10504,ARGUMENT.,again dost thou urge me to perform this another dangerous deed.”
10505,ARGUMENT.,

10509,ARGUMENT.,"Hercules, his own son? But come, [do this], and I will give thee one of"

10530,ARGUMENT.,"they both proceeded, leaving the city of Lemnos and Imbrus, mantled in"
10531,ARGUMENT.,"haze, quickly making their way; and they came to Ida of many rills, the"
10532,ARGUMENT.,"mother of wild beasts, to Lectos, where first they quitted the sea: but"

10546,ARGUMENT.,"when they first were united in love, retiring to the bed, without the"
10547,ARGUMENT.,"knowledge of their dear parents. And he stood before her, and spoke,"

10625,ARGUMENT.,"Thus quietly slumbered the sire upon the summit of Gargarus, subdued by"
10626,ARGUMENT.,"sleep and love, and held his spouse in his arms. But sweet Sleep"
10627,ARGUMENT.,"hastened to run to the ships of the Greeks, that he might deliver a"
10628,ARGUMENT.,"message to Neptune, the shaker of the earth. And, standing near, he"
10629,ARGUMENT.,addressed to him winged words:
10630,ARGUMENT.,
10631,ARGUMENT.,"“Now, Neptune, heartily give aid to the Greeks, and bestow glory upon"
10632,ARGUMENT.,"them, at least for a little, whilst yet Jove sleeps; since I have"

10637,ARGUMENT.,
10638,ARGUMENT.,"So saying, he indeed departed to the illustrious tribes of men; but he"
10639,ARGUMENT.,"still more impelled [Neptune] to assist the Greeks, and immediately"
10640,ARGUMENT.,"springing forward far into the van, he exhorted them:"
10641,ARGUMENT.,
10642,ARGUMENT.,"“O Greeks, yet again do we yield the victory to Hector, the son of"
10643,ARGUMENT.,"Priam, that he may seize the ships and bear away glory? For so indeed"
10644,ARGUMENT.,"he supposes and boasts, because Achilles remains at the hollow ships,"
10645,ARGUMENT.,"enraged at heart. However, there would not be a great need of him, if"
10646,ARGUMENT.,the rest of us were incited to assist one another. But come? let us all
10647,ARGUMENT.,"obey as I shall advise. Let us, clad with shields, as many as are best"
10648,ARGUMENT.,"and greatest in the army, who are covered as to our heads with"
10649,ARGUMENT.,"glittering helmets, and hold the longest spears in our hands, advance,"
10650,ARGUMENT.,"and I will lead the way; nor do I think that Hector, the son of Priam,"
10651,ARGUMENT.,"will await us, though very eager. Whatsoever man also is obstinate in"
10652,ARGUMENT.,"the fight, and bears but a small shield upon his shoulder, let him give"
10653,ARGUMENT.,"it to an inferior man, and let him clothe himself in a larger shield.”"
10654,ARGUMENT.,
10655,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but they listened to him readily, and obeyed. The kings"
10656,ARGUMENT.,"themselves, Tydides, Ulysses, and Agamemnon, son of Atreus, marshalled"
10657,ARGUMENT.,"[the troops], wounded as they were; and, going about among them all,"
10658,ARGUMENT.,"exchanged their martial arms, the brave [soldier] put on the good"
10659,ARGUMENT.,"[armour], and the worse they gave to the inferior man. But when they"
10660,ARGUMENT.,"had girded the splendid brass around their bodies, they began to"
10661,ARGUMENT.,"advance; and earth-shaking Neptune led them on, grasping in his firm"
10662,ARGUMENT.,"hand a dreadful tapering sword, like unto a thunderbolt, with which"
10663,ARGUMENT.,"[sword] it is not possible to engage in destructive battle, for the"
10664,ARGUMENT.,fear [of it] restrains men.
10665,ARGUMENT.,
10666,ARGUMENT.,On the other side again illustrious Hector drew up the Trojans. Then
10667,ARGUMENT.,truly azure-haired Neptune and illustrious Hector drew forth the
10668,ARGUMENT.,"severest struggle of war, the one indeed aiding the Trojans, and the"
10669,ARGUMENT.,other the Greeks. But the sea was dashed up to the tents and ships of
10670,ARGUMENT.,the Greeks and they engaged with a mighty shout. Not so loudly does the
10671,ARGUMENT.,"billow of the ocean roar against the main land, when driven from the"
10672,ARGUMENT.,deep by the rough blast of Boreas; nor so great is the crackling of
10673,ARGUMENT.,"blazing fire in the glens of a mountain, when it is raised aloft to"
10674,ARGUMENT.,consume the wood; nor so loud howls the wind amidst the high-foliaged
10675,ARGUMENT.,"oaks (which, in particular, loudly roars in its wrath), as was the cry"
10676,ARGUMENT.,"of the Trojans and Greeks shouting dreadfully, when they rushed one"
10677,ARGUMENT.,upon the other.
10678,ARGUMENT.,
10679,ARGUMENT.,"At Ajax illustrious Hector first took aim with his spear, as he was"
10680,ARGUMENT.,turned right against him; nor did he miss. [He struck him] where the
10681,ARGUMENT.,"two belts were crossed upon his breast, both that of the shield and"
10682,ARGUMENT.,that of the silver-studded sword; for these protected the tender skin:
10683,ARGUMENT.,but Hector was enraged because his swift weapon had fled from his hand
10684,ARGUMENT.,"in vain, and he retired back into the crowd of his companions, shunning"
10685,ARGUMENT.,"death. At him then, retiring, mighty Telamonian Ajax [threw] with a"
10686,ARGUMENT.,"stone, for [stones] in great numbers were rolled about among the feet"
10687,ARGUMENT.,"of the combatants, props for the fleet barks; lifting up one of these,"
10688,ARGUMENT.,"he struck him upon the breast, above the orb of the shield, near the"
10689,ARGUMENT.,"neck. And, throwing, he twirled it like a top, and it (the stone)"
10690,ARGUMENT.,"rolled round on all sides. As when, beneath a violent stroke from"
10691,ARGUMENT.,"father Jove, an oak falls uprooted, and a terrible smell of sulphur"
10692,ARGUMENT.,"arises from it; but confidence no longer possesses the man, whosoever"
10693,ARGUMENT.,"being near beholds it, because the thunderbolt of mighty Jove is"
10694,ARGUMENT.,terrible: so rapidly upon the ground fell the might of Hector in the
10695,ARGUMENT.,"dust. And he dropped his spear from his hand, his shield and helmet"
10696,ARGUMENT.,"followed above him, and his armour, variegated with brass, rang upon"
10697,ARGUMENT.,"him. Then the sons of the Greeks, loudly shouting, rushed in, hoping to"
10698,ARGUMENT.,"draw him off, and they hurled numerous javelins; but no one was able"
10699,ARGUMENT.,"either to strike from a distance, or to smite close at hand, the"
10700,ARGUMENT.,"shepherd of the people, for the bravest [of the warriors], Polydamas,"
10701,ARGUMENT.,"Æneas, and noble Agenor, Sarpedon, leader of the Lycians, and"
10702,ARGUMENT.,"illustrious Glaucus, first threw themselves round him. And no one of"
10703,ARGUMENT.,"the rest neglected him, but they held their well-orbed shields before"
10704,ARGUMENT.,"him. But his companions, up-raising him in their hands, bore him out of"
10705,ARGUMENT.,"the conflict, till they reached his fleet horses, which stood for him"
10706,ARGUMENT.,"in rear of the combat and the war, holding both the charioteer and the"
10707,ARGUMENT.,"variegated car; which then carried him towards the city, groaning"
10708,ARGUMENT.,heavily. 481

10715,ARGUMENT.,"Back to his chariot, where it stood retired"

10717,ARGUMENT.,"Gnashing for anguish, and despite, and shame.”"
10718,ARGUMENT.,
10719,ARGUMENT.,
10720,ARGUMENT.,But when now they came to the ford of the rapid-flowing current of
10721,ARGUMENT.,"eddying Xanthus, whom immortal Jove begat, there they removed him from"
10722,ARGUMENT.,"his car to the ground, and poured water over him; but he breathed"
10723,ARGUMENT.,"again, and looked up with his eyes; and, sitting upon his knees,"
10724,ARGUMENT.,"disgorged black blood. Again he fell back upon the ground, and dark"
10725,ARGUMENT.,night overshadowed his eyes; for the blow still subdued his spirits.
10726,ARGUMENT.,
10727,ARGUMENT.,"But when the Greeks saw Hector going apart, they pressed the more on"
10728,ARGUMENT.,"the Trojans, and were mindful of contest. Then swift Oïlean Ajax before"
10729,ARGUMENT.,"others, leaping forward with his fir-tree spear, wounded Satnius, son"
10730,ARGUMENT.,"of Enops, whom a Naiad, the fairest nymph, bore to Enops, when keeping"
10731,ARGUMENT.,his flocks by the banks of Satnio. Him the spear-renowned son of
10732,ARGUMENT.,"Oïleus, drawing near, wounded in the flank; but he fell supine, and"
10733,ARGUMENT.,round him the Trojans and Greeks engaged in a valiant battle. But to
10734,ARGUMENT.,"him spear-brandishing Polydamas, son of Panthous, came as an avenger,"
10735,ARGUMENT.,"and smote Prothoënor, son of Areïlochus, upon the right shoulder. The"
10736,ARGUMENT.,"tough spear passed on through his shoulder, but falling in the dust, he"
10737,ARGUMENT.,grasped the earth with his hand. And Polydamas boasted mightily over
10738,ARGUMENT.,"him, shouting aloud:"
10739,ARGUMENT.,
10740,ARGUMENT.,"“I do not think, indeed, that the weapon hath fled vainly from the"
10741,ARGUMENT.,"sturdy hand of the magnanimous son of Panthous, but some one of the"
10742,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks has received it in his body; and I think that he, leaning upon"
10743,ARGUMENT.,"it, will descend to the mansion of Pluto.”"
10744,ARGUMENT.,
10745,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke, but grief arose among the Greeks at his boasting, and"
10746,ARGUMENT.,"particularly agitated the mind of warlike Ajax, the son of Telamon, for"
10747,ARGUMENT.,he had fallen very near him; and he immediately hurled with his shining
10748,ARGUMENT.,"spear at him departing. Polydamas himself indeed avoided black fate,"
10749,ARGUMENT.,"springing off obliquely; but Archilochus, son of Antenor, received [the"
10750,ARGUMENT.,"blow], for to him the gods had doomed destruction. Him then he struck"
10751,ARGUMENT.,"upon the last vertebra, in the joining of the head and neck, and he"
10752,ARGUMENT.,"disjoined both tendons; but the head, the mouth, and the nostrils of"
10753,ARGUMENT.,"him falling, met the ground much sooner than his legs and knees. Then"
10754,ARGUMENT.,Ajax in turn cried out to blameless Polydamas:
10755,ARGUMENT.,
10756,ARGUMENT.,"“Reflect, O Polydamas, and tell me the truth; is not this man worthy to"
10757,ARGUMENT.,be slain in exchange of Prothoënor? He appears not to me indeed a
10758,ARGUMENT.,"coward, nor [sprung] from cowards, but [to be] the brother or the son"
10759,ARGUMENT.,"of horse-breaking Antenor, for he seems most like him as to his race.”"
10760,ARGUMENT.,
10761,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke, well knowing [him], but grief possessed the minds of the"
10762,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans. Then Acamas, stalking round his brother, wounded with his"
10763,ARGUMENT.,"spear Promachus, the Bœotian; whilst he was dragging him off by the"
10764,ARGUMENT.,"feet. But over him Acamas greatly boasted, calling out aloud:"
10765,ARGUMENT.,
10766,ARGUMENT.,"“Ye Argive archers, 482 insatiable in threats, assuredly not to us"
10767,ARGUMENT.,"alone will toil and sorrow accrue, but thus thou also wilt at some time"
10768,ARGUMENT.,"be slain. Consider how your Promachus sleeps, subdued by my spear, that"
10769,ARGUMENT.,a requital for my brother might not be long unpaid. Therefore should a
10770,ARGUMENT.,"man wish a brother to be left in his family, as an avenger of his"
10771,ARGUMENT.,death.”
10772,ARGUMENT.,
10773,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 482: (return)  See note on iv. 242.
10774,ARGUMENT.,
10775,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but grief arose among the Greeks as he boasted, and he"
10776,ARGUMENT.,particularly agitated the mind of warlike Peneleus. Accordingly he
10777,ARGUMENT.,"rushed upon Acamas, who awaited not the charge of king Peneleus; but he"
10778,ARGUMENT.,"wounded Ilioneus, son of Phorbas, rich in flocks, whom Mercury loved"
10779,ARGUMENT.,"most of all the Trojans, and had presented with possessions; and to"
10780,ARGUMENT.,whom his mother bore Ilioneus alone. Him then he wounded below the
10781,ARGUMENT.,"brow, in the socket of the eye, and he forced out the pupil: but the"
10782,ARGUMENT.,"spear went forward through the eye, and through the back of the head;"
10783,ARGUMENT.,"and he sat down, stretching out both his hands. But Peneleus, drawing"
10784,ARGUMENT.,"his sharp sword, smote him upon the middle of the neck, and lopped off"
10785,ARGUMENT.,"his head with its helmet to the ground, and the strong spear still"
10786,ARGUMENT.,"remained in his eye. But he (Peneleus), holding it up like a poppy,"
10787,ARGUMENT.,"shouted to the Trojans, and boasting spoke thus:"
10788,ARGUMENT.,
10789,ARGUMENT.,"“Tell for me, ye Trojans, the beloved father and mother of illustrious"
10790,ARGUMENT.,"Ilioneus, that they may lament him in their halls; for neither shall"
10791,ARGUMENT.,"the wife of Promachus, the son of Alegenor, present herself with joy to"
10792,ARGUMENT.,"her dear husband coming [back], when we, sons of the Greeks, return"
10793,ARGUMENT.,from Troy with our ships.”
10794,ARGUMENT.,
10795,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but pale fear seized upon them all, and each gazed"
10796,ARGUMENT.,"about, [seeking] where he might escape utter destruction."
10797,ARGUMENT.,
10798,ARGUMENT.,"Tell me now, ye muses, possessing Olympian dwellings, which of the"
10799,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks now first bore away gore-stained spoils of men, when the"
10800,ARGUMENT.,illustrious Earth-shaker turned the [tide of] battle.
10801,ARGUMENT.,
10802,ARGUMENT.,"Telamonian Ajax then first wounded Hyrtius, son of Gyrtias, leader of"
10803,ARGUMENT.,the undaunted Mysians; and Antilochus spoiled Phalces and Mermerus;
10804,ARGUMENT.,Meriones slew Morys and Hippotion; and Teucer slew Prothous and
10805,ARGUMENT.,Periphœtes. But the son of Atreus next wounded upon the flank
10806,ARGUMENT.,"Hyperenor, the shepherd of the people, and the spear, cutting its way,"
10807,ARGUMENT.,"drank his entrails; and his soul, expelled, fled in haste through the"
10808,ARGUMENT.,"inflicted wound, and darkness veiled his eyes. But Ajax, the swift son"
10809,ARGUMENT.,"of Oïleus, slew the most; because there was not one equal to him on"

10833,ARGUMENT.,"and Greeks, those indeed in confusion, and the Greeks throwing them"

10837,ARGUMENT.,"his senses, 484 vomiting blood, for it was not the weakest of the"
10838,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks who had wounded him. The father of men and gods, seeing, pitied"

10840,ARGUMENT.,
10841,ARGUMENT.,"“O Juno, of evil arts, impracticable, thy stratagem has made noble"

10843,ARGUMENT.,not whether again thou mayest not be the first to reap the fruits of
10844,ARGUMENT.,"thy pernicious machinations, and I may chastise thee with stripes. Dost"

10850,ARGUMENT.,"hurled from the threshold [of heaven], till he reached the earth,"
10851,ARGUMENT.,"hardly breathing. Nor even thus did my vehement anger, through grief"
10852,ARGUMENT.,"for divine Hercules, leave me; whom thou, prevailing upon the storms,"
10853,ARGUMENT.,"with the north wind, didst send over the unfruitful sea, designing"
10854,ARGUMENT.,"evils, and afterwards bore him out of his course, to well-inhabited"
10855,ARGUMENT.,"Cos. I liberated him, indeed, and brought him back thence to"

10893,ARGUMENT.,"unwarlike panic [amongst them], and, flying, let them fall back upon"

10902,ARGUMENT.,"of the immortals to assist the Greeks, before that the request of the"
10903,ARGUMENT.,"son of Peleus be completed; as first I promised to him, and nodded"
10904,ARGUMENT.,"assent with my head, on that day when the goddess Thetis touched my"

10907,ARGUMENT.,
10908,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke, nor did the white-armed goddess Juno disobey, but went"

10910,ARGUMENT.,"a man flashes swiftly [in thought], who, having traversed over many a"
10911,ARGUMENT.,"land, thinks within his prudent heart, “I was here, I was there,” and"
10912,ARGUMENT.,"deliberates much: thus quickly hastening, up sprung venerable Juno. But"
10913,ARGUMENT.,"she reached lofty Olympus, and came in upon the immortal gods,"
10914,ARGUMENT.,"assembled in the house of Jove but they beholding her, all rose up and"
10915,ARGUMENT.,"welcomed her with their cups. The rest, however, she neglected, but"
10916,ARGUMENT.,"received a goblet from fair-cheeked Themis; for she first running, came"
10917,ARGUMENT.,"to meet her, and addressing her, spoke winged words:"
10918,ARGUMENT.,

10926,ARGUMENT.,"the palaces of the gods, and thou shalt hear these things along with"
10927,ARGUMENT.,"all the immortals, what evil deeds Jove denounces. Nor do I at all"

10930,ARGUMENT.,
10931,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having spoken, venerable Juno sat down; but the gods were grieved"

10954,ARGUMENT.,"“Do not now blame me, ye who possess the Olympic mansions, repairing to"
10955,ARGUMENT.,"the ships of the Greeks, to avenge the slaughter of my son, even"
10956,ARGUMENT.,"although it should be my fate, smitten with the thunderbolt of Jove, to"
10957,ARGUMENT.,lie together with the dead bodies in blood and dust.”
10958,ARGUMENT.,
10959,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spake, and he commanded Fear and Flight to yoke his steeds, but"
10960,ARGUMENT.,he himself girded on his shining armour. Then indeed some other greater
10961,ARGUMENT.,and more grievous wrath and indignation had fallen upon the immortals
10962,ARGUMENT.,"from Jove, had not Minerva, greatly fearing for all the gods, leaped"
10963,ARGUMENT.,"forth from the vestibule, and left the throne where she sat. From his"
10964,ARGUMENT.,"head she snatched the helmet, and the shield from his shoulders, and"
10965,ARGUMENT.,"taking the brazen spear out of his strong hand, she placed it upright;"
10966,ARGUMENT.,and rebuked impetuous Mars with [these] words:
10967,ARGUMENT.,
10968,ARGUMENT.,"“Infuriated one, infatuated in mind, thou art undone! are thy ears"
10969,ARGUMENT.,"indeed useless for hearing, and have thy sense and shame perished? Dost"
10970,ARGUMENT.,"thou not hear what the white-armed goddess Juno says, and she has just"
10971,ARGUMENT.,"now come from Olympian Jove? Dost thou thyself wish, having fulfilled"
10972,ARGUMENT.,"many misfortunes, to return to Olympus very much grieved, and by"
10973,ARGUMENT.,"compulsion, and also to create a great evil to all the rest? For he"
10974,ARGUMENT.,"will immediately leave the Trojans and magnanimous Greeks, and will"
10975,ARGUMENT.,"come against us, about to disturb us in Olympus; and will seize us one"
10976,ARGUMENT.,"after the other, whoever is culpable and who is not. Wherefore I exhort"
10977,ARGUMENT.,"thee now to lay aside thy wrath on account of thy son, for already some"
10978,ARGUMENT.,"one, even superior to him in strength and in hands, either is slain, or"
10979,ARGUMENT.,will be hereafter; for it would be a difficult task to liberate [from
10980,ARGUMENT.,death] the race and offspring of all men.”
10981,ARGUMENT.,
10982,ARGUMENT.,"So saying, she seated impetuous Mars upon his throne. But Juno called"
10983,ARGUMENT.,"Apollo outside the house, and Iris, who is the messenger among the"
10984,ARGUMENT.,"immortal gods, and addressing them, spoke winged words:"
10985,ARGUMENT.,
10986,ARGUMENT.,"“Jove orders you twain to repair with all haste to Ida, but when ye"
10987,ARGUMENT.,"arrive, and look upon the countenance of Jove, do whatsoever he may"
10988,ARGUMENT.,urge and command.”
10989,ARGUMENT.,
10990,ARGUMENT.,"Then indeed, having thus spoken, venerable Juno retired, and sat down"
10991,ARGUMENT.,"upon her throne; but they, hastening, flew and arrived at Ida of many"
10992,ARGUMENT.,"rills, the mother of wild beasts. They found the far-seeing son of"
10993,ARGUMENT.,"Saturn sitting upon lofty Gargarus, and an odoriferous cloud encircled"
10994,ARGUMENT.,"him around. But coming before cloud-compelling Jove, they stood; nor"
10995,ARGUMENT.,"was he enraged in his mind, beholding them, because they quickly obeyed"
10996,ARGUMENT.,the commands of his dear wife. And first to Iris he addressed winged
10997,ARGUMENT.,words:
10998,ARGUMENT.,
10999,ARGUMENT.,"“Haste, begone, fleet Iris, tell all these things to king Neptune, nor"
11000,ARGUMENT.,"be thou a false messenger. Order him, having ceased from the battle and"
11001,ARGUMENT.,"the war, to repair to the assemblies of the gods, or to the vast sea."
11002,ARGUMENT.,"If, however, he will not obey my words, but shall despise them, let him"
11003,ARGUMENT.,"then consider in his mind and soul, lest, however powerful he may be,"
11004,ARGUMENT.,he may not be able to withstand me coming against him; for I say that I
11005,ARGUMENT.,"am superior to him in strength, and elder in birth; but his heart fears"
11006,ARGUMENT.,"riot to assert himself equal to me, whom even the others dread.”"
11007,ARGUMENT.,
11008,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke, nor was wind-footed, swift Iris disobedient: but she"
11009,ARGUMENT.,descended from the Idæan mountains to sacred Ilium. And as when snow
11010,ARGUMENT.,"drifts from the clouds, or cold hail, by the impulse of"
11011,ARGUMENT.,"cloud-dispelling 486 Boreas, so quickly swift Iris with eagerness flew"
11012,ARGUMENT.,"along, and standing near illustrious Neptune, she addressed him:"
11013,ARGUMENT.,
11014,ARGUMENT.,"“O azure-haired Earth-shaker, I have come hither, bringing a certain"
11015,ARGUMENT.,"message to thee from ægis-bearing Jove. He has commanded thee, having"
11016,ARGUMENT.,"ceased from the battle and the war, to repair either to the assemblies"
11017,ARGUMENT.,"of the gods or to the vast sea. But if thou wilt not obey his words,"
11018,ARGUMENT.,"but shalt despise them, he threatens that he will come hither himself"
11019,ARGUMENT.,"to fight against thee; and advises thee to avoid his hands, because he"
11020,ARGUMENT.,"asserts that he is greatly superior to thee in strength, and elder in"
11021,ARGUMENT.,birth: but thy heart does not fear to profess that thou art equal to
11022,ARGUMENT.,"him, whom even the others dread.”"
11023,ARGUMENT.,
11024,ARGUMENT.,"But her illustrious Neptune, greatly indignant, then addressed: “Gods!"
11025,ARGUMENT.,"powerful though he be, he surely has spoken proudly, if he will by"
11026,ARGUMENT.,"force restrain me unwilling, who am of equal honour. For we are three"
11027,ARGUMENT.,"brothers [descended] from Saturn, whom Rhea brought forth: Jupiter and"
11028,ARGUMENT.,"I, and Pluto, governing the infernal regions, the third; all things"
11029,ARGUMENT.,"were divided into three parts, and each was allotted his dignity. 487 I"
11030,ARGUMENT.,"in the first place, the lots being shaken, was allotted to inhabit for"
11031,ARGUMENT.,"ever the hoary sea, and Pluto next obtained the pitchy darkness; but"
11032,ARGUMENT.,Jove in the third place had allotted to him the wide heaven in the air
11033,ARGUMENT.,and in the clouds. Nevertheless the earth is still the common property
11034,ARGUMENT.,"of all, and lofty Olympus. Wherefore I shall not live according to the"
11035,ARGUMENT.,"will of Jove, but although being very powerful, let him remain quiet in"
11036,ARGUMENT.,his third part; and let him by no means terrify me as a coward with his
11037,ARGUMENT.,hands. For it would be better for him to insult with terrific language
11038,ARGUMENT.,"the daughters and sons whom he hath begotten, who will also through"
11039,ARGUMENT.,"necessity attend to him, exhorting them.”"
11040,ARGUMENT.,
11041,ARGUMENT.,But him the fleet wind-footed Iris then answered: “O 488 azure-haired
11042,ARGUMENT.,"Earth-shaker, shall I really thus bear back from thee to Jove this"
11043,ARGUMENT.,relentless and violent reply? Or wilt thou change it at all? The minds
11044,ARGUMENT.,of the prudent indeed are flexible. Thou knowest that the Furies are
11045,ARGUMENT.,ever attendant on the elders.” 489

11063,ARGUMENT.,and avenge their wrongs. This is an instance that the pagans looked
11064,ARGUMENT.,upon birthright as a right divine. Eustath. quoted in ed. Dubl. cf. ix.
11065,ARGUMENT.,507.
11066,ARGUMENT.,
11067,ARGUMENT.,"But her again earth-shaking Neptune in turn addressed: “Goddess Iris,"
11068,ARGUMENT.,"very rightly hast thou delivered this opinion; moreover, it is good"
11069,ARGUMENT.,when a messenger knows fitting things. But on this account severe
11070,ARGUMENT.,"indignation comes upon my heart and soul, because he wishes to chide"
11071,ARGUMENT.,"with angry words me, equal to him by lot, and doomed to an equal"
11072,ARGUMENT.,"destiny. Nevertheless, at present, although being indignant, I will"
11073,ARGUMENT.,"give way. But another thing will I tell thee, and I will threaten this"
11074,ARGUMENT.,"from my soul; if indeed, without me and prey-hunting Minerva, Juno,"
11075,ARGUMENT.,"Mercury, and king Vulcan, he shall spare lofty Ilium, nor shall wish to"
11076,ARGUMENT.,"destroy it, and give great glory to the Greeks; let him know this, that"
11077,ARGUMENT.,endless animosity shall arise between us.”
11078,ARGUMENT.,
11079,ARGUMENT.,"So saying, the Earth-shaker quitted the Grecian army, and proceeding,"
11080,ARGUMENT.,he plunged into the deep; but the Grecian heroes longed for him. And
11081,ARGUMENT.,then cloud-compelling Jove addressed Apollo:
11082,ARGUMENT.,
11083,ARGUMENT.,"“Go now, dear Phœbus, to brazen-helmed Hector; for already hath"
11084,ARGUMENT.,"earth-encircling Neptune departed to the vast sea, avoiding our"
11085,ARGUMENT.,"dreadful anger; for otherwise the rest, who are infernal gods, being"
11086,ARGUMENT.,"around Saturn, would surely have heard our quarrel. This, however, is"
11087,ARGUMENT.,"much better for me as well as for himself, that he hath first yielded"
11088,ARGUMENT.,"to my hands, accounting himself worthy of blame, because the matter"
11089,ARGUMENT.,would not have been accomplished without sweat. But do thou take the
11090,ARGUMENT.,"fringed ægis in thy hands, with which, by violently shaking it, do thou"
11091,ARGUMENT.,"greatly terrify the Grecian heroes. To thyself, however, O far-darting"
11092,ARGUMENT.,"[Apollo], let illustrious Hector be a care. So long then arouse his"
11093,ARGUMENT.,"great might unto him, until the Greeks in flight reach the ships and"
11094,ARGUMENT.,"the Hellespont. Thenceforth I shall myself deliberate in deed and word,"
11095,ARGUMENT.,how the Greeks also may revive from labour.”
11096,ARGUMENT.,
11097,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke, nor did Apollo disobey his sire, but he descended from"
11098,ARGUMENT.,"the Idæan mountains like unto a swift hawk the dove-destroyer, the"
11099,ARGUMENT.,"swiftest of birds. He found the son of warlike Priam, noble Hector,"
11100,ARGUMENT.,"sitting; for he no longer lay [on the ground], but had just collected"
11101,ARGUMENT.,"his senses, recognizing his friends around him. But the panting and"
11102,ARGUMENT.,"perspiration had ceased, since the will of ægis-bearing Jove had"
11103,ARGUMENT.,"aroused him. Then far-darting Apollo, standing near, addressed him:"
11104,ARGUMENT.,
11105,ARGUMENT.,"“Hector, son of Priam, why sittest thou apart from the rest, failing in"
11106,ARGUMENT.,strength? Has any grief invaded thee?”
11107,ARGUMENT.,
11108,ARGUMENT.,But him then crest-tossing Hector languidly addressed: “And who art
11109,ARGUMENT.,"thou, best of the gods, who inquirest face to face? Hast thou not heard"
11110,ARGUMENT.,"that Ajax, brave in the din of battle, smote me with a stone upon the"
11111,ARGUMENT.,"breast, and caused me to cease from impetuous valour, when slaying his"
11112,ARGUMENT.,companions at the sterns of the Grecian ships? And truly I thought that
11113,ARGUMENT.,"I should this day behold the dead, and the mansion of Pluto, since I"
11114,ARGUMENT.,was [on the point of] breathing out my dear life.”
11115,ARGUMENT.,
11116,ARGUMENT.,But him far-darting king Apollo addressed in turn: “Be of good courage
11117,ARGUMENT.,"now, so great an assistant has the son of Saturn sent forth from Ida to"
11118,ARGUMENT.,"stand up and help thee, Phœbus Apollo, of the golden sword: who am"
11119,ARGUMENT.,accustomed to defend at the same time thyself and the lofty city. But
11120,ARGUMENT.,"come, encourage now thy numerous cavalry to drive their fleet steeds"
11121,ARGUMENT.,"towards the hollow ships; but I, going before, will level the whole way"
11122,ARGUMENT.,"for the horses, and I will turn to flight the Grecian heroes.”"
11123,ARGUMENT.,
11124,ARGUMENT.,"Thus speaking, he inspired great strength into the shepherd of the"
11125,ARGUMENT.,"people. As when some stalled horse, fed on barley 490 at the manger,"
11126,ARGUMENT.,"having snapped his halter, runs over the plain, striking the earth with"
11127,ARGUMENT.,"his feet (accustomed to bathe in the smooth-flowing river), exulting,"
11128,ARGUMENT.,"he holds his head on high, and around his shoulders his mane is"
11129,ARGUMENT.,"dishevelled; and, trusting to his beauty 491—his knees easily bear him"
11130,ARGUMENT.,to the accustomed places and pasture of the mares: so Hector swiftly
11131,ARGUMENT.,"moved his feet and knees, encouraging the horsemen, after he had heard"
11132,ARGUMENT.,the voice of the god. But they—as dogs and rustic men rush against
11133,ARGUMENT.,either a horned stag or wild goat; which however a lofty rock and shady
11134,ARGUMENT.,"forest protect, nor is it destined for them to catch it; but at their"
11135,ARGUMENT.,"clamour 492 a bushy-bearded lion appears in the way, and turns them all"
11136,ARGUMENT.,"back, although ardently pursuing: thus the Greeks hitherto indeed ever"
11137,ARGUMENT.,"kept following in troops, striking with their swords and double-edged"
11138,ARGUMENT.,"spears. But when they beheld Hector entering the ranks of heroes, they"
11139,ARGUMENT.,"were troubled, and the courage of all fell at their feet."

11149,ARGUMENT.,"the Ætolians, skilled in the use of the javelin, and brave in the"
11150,ARGUMENT.,standing fight; few also of the Greeks excelled him in the council when
11151,ARGUMENT.,"the youths contended in eloquence. Who wisely counselling, harangued"
11152,ARGUMENT.,"them, and said:"
11153,ARGUMENT.,
11154,ARGUMENT.,"“O gods, surely I behold with mine eyes this mighty miracle, since"
11155,ARGUMENT.,"Hector has thus risen again, having escaped death. Certainly the mind"
11156,ARGUMENT.,of each was in great hopes that he had died by the hands of Telamonian
11157,ARGUMENT.,Ajax. But some one of the gods has again liberated and preserved
11158,ARGUMENT.,"Hector, who hath already relaxed the knees of many Greeks; as I think"
11159,ARGUMENT.,"is about [to occur] now also, for not without far-sounding Jove does he"
11160,ARGUMENT.,"stand in the van, thus earnest. But come, let us all obey as I shall"
11161,ARGUMENT.,desire. Let us order the multitude to retreat towards the ships. But
11162,ARGUMENT.,"let us, as many as boast ourselves to be the best in the army, take a"
11163,ARGUMENT.,"stand, if indeed, opposing, we may at the outset interrupt him,"
11164,ARGUMENT.,"upraising our spears; and I think that he, although raging, will dread"
11165,ARGUMENT.,in mind to enter the band of the Greeks.”
11166,ARGUMENT.,
11167,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but all heard him attentively, and obeyed. Those around"
11168,ARGUMENT.,"the Ajaces and king Idomeneus, Teucer, Meriones, and Meges, equal to"
11169,ARGUMENT.,"Mars, calling the chiefs together, marshalled their lines against"
11170,ARGUMENT.,Hector and the Trojans; whilst the multitude in the rear retreated to
11171,ARGUMENT.,the ships of the Greeks. But the Trojans in close array pressed
11172,ARGUMENT.,"forward; and Hector, taking long strides, led the way; but before him"
11173,ARGUMENT.,"walked Phœbus Apollo, clad as to his shoulders with a cloud, 493 and he"
11174,ARGUMENT.,"held the mighty, dreadful, fringed, 494 dazzling ægis, which the artist"
11175,ARGUMENT.,"Vulcan had given to Jove, to be borne along for the routing of men."
11176,ARGUMENT.,"Holding this in his hands, he led on the people. But the Greeks"
11177,ARGUMENT.,"remained in close array, and a shrill shout arose on both sides. [Many]"
11178,ARGUMENT.,"arrows bounded from the strings, and many spears from gallant hands:"
11179,ARGUMENT.,"some were fixed in the bodies of warlike youths, but many half way,"
11180,ARGUMENT.,"before they had touched the fair body, stuck in the earth, longing to"
11181,ARGUMENT.,satiate themselves with flesh. As long as Phœbus Apollo held the ægis
11182,ARGUMENT.,"unmoved in his hands, so long did the weapons reach both sides, and the"
11183,ARGUMENT.,"people fell. But when, looking full in the faces of the swift-horsed"
11184,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks, he shook it, and he himself besides shouted very loudly, then"
11185,ARGUMENT.,"he checked the courage in their breasts, and they became forgetful of"
11186,ARGUMENT.,"impetuous valour. But they, as when two wild beasts, in the depth of"
11187,ARGUMENT.,"the dark night, 495 disturb a drove of oxen or a great flock of sheep,"
11188,ARGUMENT.,"coming suddenly upon them, the keeper not being present—so the"
11189,ARGUMENT.,"enfeebled Greeks were routed; for amongst them Apollo sent terror, and"
11190,ARGUMENT.,"gave glory to the Trojans and to Hector. Then indeed man slew man, when"
11191,ARGUMENT.,the battle gave way. Hector slew Stichius and Arcesilaus; the one the
11192,ARGUMENT.,leader of the brazen-mailed Bœotians; but the other the faithful
11193,ARGUMENT.,companion of magnanimous Menestheus. But Æneas slew Medon and Iasus:
11194,ARGUMENT.,"Medon indeed was the illegitimate son of godlike Oïleus, and brother of"
11195,ARGUMENT.,"Ajax; and he dwelt in Phylace, away from his father-land, having slain"
11196,ARGUMENT.,"a man, the brother of his stepmother Eriopis, whom Oïleus had"
11197,ARGUMENT.,"betrothed. Iasus, however, was appointed leader of the Athenians, and"
11198,ARGUMENT.,"was called the son of Sphelus, the son of Bucolus. But Polydamas slew"
11199,ARGUMENT.,"Mecistis, and Polites Echius, in the van, and noble Agenor slew"
11200,ARGUMENT.,Klonius. Paris also wounded Dëiochous in the extremity of the shoulder

11216,ARGUMENT.,"aloud, exhorted the Trojans to rush upon the ships, and to let go the"
11217,ARGUMENT.,bloody spoils: “And whatever person I 496 shall perceive apart from the
11218,ARGUMENT.,"ships anywhere, there will I cause his death; nor indeed shall his male"

11227,ARGUMENT.,
11228,ARGUMENT.,"So saying, with the lash upon the shoulder he drove on his horses"
11229,ARGUMENT.,"against the ranks, cheering on the Trojans; but they all shouting along"
11230,ARGUMENT.,"with him, directed their car-drawing steeds with a mighty clamour. But"
11231,ARGUMENT.,"Phœbus Apollo in front of them, easily overthrowing the banks of the"
11232,ARGUMENT.,"deep ditch with his feet, cast [them] into the middle; and bridged a"
11233,ARGUMENT.,"causeway long and wide, as far as the cast of a spear reaches, when a"
11234,ARGUMENT.,"man, making trial of his strength, hurls it. In that way they poured"
11235,ARGUMENT.,"onward by troops, and Apollo [went] before them, holding the"
11236,ARGUMENT.,highly-prized ægis. But he overthrew the wall of the Greeks very
11237,ARGUMENT.,"easily, as when any boy does the sand from the shore; who, when amusing"
11238,ARGUMENT.,"himself in childishness he has made playthings, again destroys them"
11239,ARGUMENT.,"with his feet and hands. Thus, O archer Phœbus, didst thou destroy the"
11240,ARGUMENT.,"great labour and toil of the Greeks, and didst excite flight amongst"
11241,ARGUMENT.,"themselves. In this manner indeed, remaining, they were penned up at"
11242,ARGUMENT.,"the ships; animating each other, and raising up their hands to all the"
11243,ARGUMENT.,"gods, they each loudly offered vows. But the guardian of the Greeks,"
11244,ARGUMENT.,"Gerenian Nestor, most particularly prayed, stretching forth his hands"
11245,ARGUMENT.,"to the starry heaven: “O father Jove, if ever any one in fruitful"
11246,ARGUMENT.,"Argos, to thee burning the fat thighs of either oxen or sheep,"
11247,ARGUMENT.,"supplicated that he might return, and thou didst promise and assent; be"
11248,ARGUMENT.,"mindful of these things, O Olympian, and avert the cruel day; nor thus"
11249,ARGUMENT.,permit the Greeks to be subdued by the Trojans.”
11250,ARGUMENT.,
11251,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke, praying: but provident Jove loudly thundered, hearing"
11252,ARGUMENT.,"the prayers of the Neleïan old man. But the Trojans, when they"
11253,ARGUMENT.,"understood the will of ægis-bearing Jove, rushed the more against the"
11254,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks, and were mindful of battle. And as a mighty wave of the"
11255,ARGUMENT.,"wide-flowing ocean dashes over the sides of a ship, when the force of"
11256,ARGUMENT.,the wind impels it (for that most of all increases waves); so the
11257,ARGUMENT.,Trojans with a mighty shout mounted over the wall. And having driven in
11258,ARGUMENT.,"their horses, they fought at the sterns, hand to hand with two-edged"
11259,ARGUMENT.,"spears, the one party from their chariots, but the other on high from"
11260,ARGUMENT.,"their black ships, having ascended them with long poles which lay in"
11261,ARGUMENT.,"their vessels, for fighting by sea, well glued, and clad on the tip"
11262,ARGUMENT.,with brass.
11263,ARGUMENT.,
11264,ARGUMENT.,"But Patroclus, as long indeed as the Greeks and Trojans fought round"
11265,ARGUMENT.,"the wall, without the swift ships, so long he sat in the tent of"
11266,ARGUMENT.,"valour-loving Eurypylus, and delighted him with his discourse; and to"
11267,ARGUMENT.,"the severe wound he applied medicines, assuagers of dark pains. But"
11268,ARGUMENT.,"when he perceived that the Trojans had burst within the walls, and"
11269,ARGUMENT.,"moreover that a clamour and flight of the Greeks had arisen, then"
11270,ARGUMENT.,"indeed he groaned, and smote both his thighs with his downward-bent"
11271,ARGUMENT.,hands; and lamenting spoke:
11272,ARGUMENT.,
11273,ARGUMENT.,"“O Eurypylus, I cannot any longer remain here with thee, although"
11274,ARGUMENT.,"needing much, for now has a mighty contest arisen. But let thy"
11275,ARGUMENT.,"attendant entertain thee, and I will hasten to Achilles, that I may"
11276,ARGUMENT.,"encourage him to fight. And who knows whether, with God’s assistance,"
11277,ARGUMENT.,"persuading, I may move his soul? for the admonition of a companion is"
11278,ARGUMENT.,effectual.” But him his feet then bore away thus speaking. Meanwhile
11279,ARGUMENT.,"the Greeks firmly withstood the Trojans rushing on, nor were they able"
11280,ARGUMENT.,"to repel them from the ships, although being fewer; nor could the"
11281,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans, breaking through the phalanxes of the Greeks, be mingled with"
11282,ARGUMENT.,the tents or ships. But as a plumb-line in the hands of a skilful
11283,ARGUMENT.,shipwright (who knows well the whole art by the precepts of Minerva)
11284,ARGUMENT.,"correctly adjusts the naval plank, so was the battle and war equally"
11285,ARGUMENT.,"extended. Some indeed supported the conflict round one ship, and others"
11286,ARGUMENT.,"round another, but Hector advanced against glorious Ajax. Thus these"
11287,ARGUMENT.,"two undertook the task round one ship, nor were they able, the one to"
11288,ARGUMENT.,"drive the other away and burn the ship with fire, nor the other to"
11289,ARGUMENT.,"repulse him, since a divinity had brought him near. Then illustrious"
11290,ARGUMENT.,"Ajax smote upon the breast with his spear Caletor, son of Clytius,"
11291,ARGUMENT.,"bearing fire against the ship; and falling, he resounded, and the torch"
11292,ARGUMENT.,fell from his hand. But when Hector perceived with his eyes his cousin
11293,ARGUMENT.,"fallen in the dust before the black ship, he cheered on the Trojans and"
11294,ARGUMENT.,"Lycians, loudly exclaiming:"
11295,ARGUMENT.,
11296,ARGUMENT.,"“Ye Trojans and Lycians, and close-fighting Dardanians, do not now"
11297,ARGUMENT.,retire from the fight in this narrow pass. But preserve the son of
11298,ARGUMENT.,"Clytius, lest the Greeks despoil him of his armour, having fallen in"
11299,ARGUMENT.,"the contest at the ships.” Thus having spoken, he took aim with his"
11300,ARGUMENT.,"shining spear at Ajax, whom he missed; but [he smote] Lycophron, the"
11301,ARGUMENT.,"son of Mastor, the servant of Ajax, a Cytherean, who dwelt with him,"
11302,ARGUMENT.,since he had killed a man amongst the celebrated Cythereans. He struck
11303,ARGUMENT.,"him on the head over the ear, with the sharp brass, whilst he was"
11304,ARGUMENT.,standing near Ajax: but he fell supine to the ground from the stern of
11305,ARGUMENT.,"the ship in the dust, and his limbs were relaxed. Then Ajax shuddered,"
11306,ARGUMENT.,"and accosted his brother: “Dear Teucer, now is our faithful companion,"
11307,ARGUMENT.,"the son of Mastor, whom being domesticated in Cythera, we honoured"
11308,ARGUMENT.,equally with our beloved parents in our palaces; but him magnanimous
11309,ARGUMENT.,"Hector has slain. Where now are thy death-bearing arrows and bow, which"
11310,ARGUMENT.,Phœbus Apollo gave thee?”
11311,ARGUMENT.,
11312,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but he understood; and running, he stood near him,"
11313,ARGUMENT.,"holding in his hand his bent bow, and arrow-bearing quiver; and very"
11314,ARGUMENT.,"quickly he shot his arrows amongst the Trojans. He struck Clitus, the"
11315,ARGUMENT.,"illustrious son of Pisenor, the companion of Polydamas, the renowned"
11316,ARGUMENT.,"son of Panthous, holding the reins in his hands. He indeed was employed"
11317,ARGUMENT.,"in [guiding] the horses; for he directed them there, where the most"
11318,ARGUMENT.,"numerous phalanxes were thrown in confusion, gratifying Hector and the"
11319,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans. But soon came evil upon him, which no one averted from him,"
11320,ARGUMENT.,"although eager; for the bitter shaft fell upon his neck from behind,"
11321,ARGUMENT.,"and he fell from the chariot, whilst his horses started back, rattling"
11322,ARGUMENT.,"the empty car. But king Polydamas very quickly perceived it, and first"
11323,ARGUMENT.,"came to meet his horses. Them he intrusted to Astynous, son of"
11324,ARGUMENT.,"Protiaon, and exhorted him much to keep the horses near him within"
11325,ARGUMENT.,sight; but he himself returning was mingled with the foremost
11326,ARGUMENT.,"combatants. Teucer, however, drew another arrow against brazen-armed"
11327,ARGUMENT.,"Hector, and would have made him cease from battle, at the ships of the"
11328,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks, if striking him while bravely fighting, he had taken away his"
11329,ARGUMENT.,"life. But it did not escape the prudent mind of Jove, who protected"
11330,ARGUMENT.,"Hector, and deprived Teucer, the son of Telamon, of glory; and who"
11331,ARGUMENT.,"(Jove) broke the well-twisted string, in his blameless bow, as he was"
11332,ARGUMENT.,drawing against [Hector]; but the brass-laden arrow was turned off in
11333,ARGUMENT.,"another direction, and the bow fell from his hand. Then Teucer"
11334,ARGUMENT.,"shuddered, and addressed his brother:"
11335,ARGUMENT.,
11336,ARGUMENT.,"“Ye gods! a deity, without doubt, cuts short the plans of our battle,"
11337,ARGUMENT.,"who has shaken the bow from my hand, and has snapped asunder the"
11338,ARGUMENT.,"newly-twisted string which I tied to it this morning, that it might"
11339,ARGUMENT.,sustain the shafts frequently bounding from it.”
11340,ARGUMENT.,
11341,ARGUMENT.,"But him the mighty Telamonian Ajax then answered: “O my friend, permit"
11342,ARGUMENT.,"then thy bow and numerous arrows to lie aside, since a god has"
11343,ARGUMENT.,"confounded them, envying the Greeks; but, taking a long spear in thy"
11344,ARGUMENT.,"hands, and a shield upon thy shoulder, fight against the Trojans, and"
11345,ARGUMENT.,encourage the other forces. Nor let them take the well-benched ships
11346,ARGUMENT.,"without labour at least, although having subdued us, but let us be"
11347,ARGUMENT.,mindful of the fight.”
11348,ARGUMENT.,
11349,ARGUMENT.,Thus he spoke; and he placed his bow within the tents. Then around his
11350,ARGUMENT.,"shoulders he hung a four-fold shield, and upon his brave head fixed a"
11351,ARGUMENT.,"well-made helmet, crested with horse-hair, and the plume nodded"
11352,ARGUMENT.,"dreadfully from above. And he grasped a stout spear, tipped with sharp"
11353,ARGUMENT.,"brass, and hastened to advance, and running very quickly, stood beside"
11354,ARGUMENT.,"Ajax. But when Hector perceived the arrows of Teucer frustrated, he"
11355,ARGUMENT.,"encouraged the Trojans and Lycians, calling aloud:"
11356,ARGUMENT.,
11357,ARGUMENT.,"“Ye Trojans, Lycians, and close-fighting Dardanians, be men, my"
11358,ARGUMENT.,"friends, and be mindful of impetuous valour at the hollow ships; for I"
11359,ARGUMENT.,have beheld with my eyes the arrows of their chief warrior rendered
11360,ARGUMENT.,"vain by Jove. Easily recognizable amongst men is the power of Jove, as"
11361,ARGUMENT.,"well among those into whose hands he has delivered superior glory, as"
11362,ARGUMENT.,"those whom he deteriorates, and does not wish to defend. As now he"
11363,ARGUMENT.,"diminishes the might of the Greeks, and aids us. But fight in close"
11364,ARGUMENT.,"array at the ships, and whichever of you, wounded or stricken, shall"
11365,ARGUMENT.,"draw on his death and fate, let him die; it is not inglorious to him to"
11366,ARGUMENT.,"die fighting for his country; but his wife shall be safe, and his"
11367,ARGUMENT.,"children left behind him, his house and patrimony unimpaired, if indeed"
11368,ARGUMENT.,the Greeks depart with their ships to their dear father-land.”
11369,ARGUMENT.,
11370,ARGUMENT.,"So saying, he kindled the strength and spirit of each: and Ajax again,"
11371,ARGUMENT.,"on the other side, animated his companions:"
11372,ARGUMENT.,
11373,ARGUMENT.,"“Shame, oh Argives! now is the moment for us either to perish, or to be"
11374,ARGUMENT.,preserved and to repel destruction from the ships. Do ye expect that if
11375,ARGUMENT.,"crest-tossing Hector capture the ships, ye will reach on foot each his"
11376,ARGUMENT.,"native land? Do ye not hear Hector, who now rages to fire the ships,"
11377,ARGUMENT.,inciting all his people? Nor indeed does he invite them to come to a
11378,ARGUMENT.,"dance, but to battle. But for us there is no opinion or design better"
11379,ARGUMENT.,"than this, to join in close fight our hands and strength. Better,"
11380,ARGUMENT.,"either to perish at once, or live, rather than thus uselessly to be"
11381,ARGUMENT.,"wasted away 497 for a length of time in dire contention at the ships,"
11382,ARGUMENT.,by inferior men.”
11383,ARGUMENT.,
11384,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 497: (return)  The verb στρεύγεσθαι, which may be compared"
11385,ARGUMENT.,"with ἀπολιβάζειν in Od. xii. 351, is interpreted by Apollonius"
11386,ARGUMENT.,"καταπονεῖσθαι. Cf. Hesych. t. i. p. 1603, t. ii. p. 1278."
11387,ARGUMENT.,
11388,ARGUMENT.,"So saying, he aroused the strength and courage of each. Then Hector"
11389,ARGUMENT.,"indeed slew Schedius, son of Perimedes, prince of the Phoceans; and"
11390,ARGUMENT.,"Ajax slew Laodamas, leader of the infantry, the illustrious son of"
11391,ARGUMENT.,"Antenor. Polydamas slew Cyllenian Otus, the companion of the son of"
11392,ARGUMENT.,"Phyleus, chief of the magnanimous Epeans. Meges rushed upon him,"
11393,ARGUMENT.,"perceiving it, but Polydamas stooped obliquely, and he missed him; for"
11394,ARGUMENT.,Apollo did not suffer the son of Panthous to be subdued among the
11395,ARGUMENT.,foremost warriors. But he wounded Crœsmus in the middle of the breast
11396,ARGUMENT.,"with his spear, but falling, he resounded; and he stripped the arms"
11397,ARGUMENT.,"from his shoulders. In the meantime Dolops, the descendant of Lampus,"
11398,ARGUMENT.,"well skilled in the spear, leaped upon him (he whom Lampus, son of"
11399,ARGUMENT.,"Laomedon, the best of men, begat, skilled in impetuous fight), who then"
11400,ARGUMENT.,"attacking him in close fight, struck the middle of Meges’s shield with"
11401,ARGUMENT.,"his spear: but the thick corslet defended him, which he wore, compact"
11402,ARGUMENT.,"in its cavities. This Phyleus formerly brought from Ephyre, from the"
11403,ARGUMENT.,"river Selleïs: for his host, Euphetes, king of men, had given it to"
11404,ARGUMENT.,"him, to bear into the battle as a defence against the enemy; and which"
11405,ARGUMENT.,then warded off destruction from the body of his son. But Meges with
11406,ARGUMENT.,his sharp spear smote the base of the highest cone of his brazen
11407,ARGUMENT.,"horse-haired helmet, and struck off his horse-haired crest; and the"
11408,ARGUMENT.,"whole fell on the ground in the dust, lately shining with purple."
11409,ARGUMENT.,"Whilst the one (Meges) standing firm, fought with the other (Dolops),"
11410,ARGUMENT.,"and still expected victory; meanwhile, warlike Menelaus came as an"
11411,ARGUMENT.,"assistant to him (Meges), and stood at his side with his spear,"
11412,ARGUMENT.,"escaping notice, and wounded him from behind in the shoulder; but the"
11413,ARGUMENT.,"spear, driven with violence, passed through his breast, proceeding"
11414,ARGUMENT.,"farther; and he fell on his face. Both then rushed on, about to tear"
11415,ARGUMENT.,the brazen armour from his shoulders; but Hector strenuously exhorted
11416,ARGUMENT.,"all his relations, and rebuked the gallant Melanippus first, the son of"
11417,ARGUMENT.,"Hicetaon. He till then had fed his curved-footed oxen at Percote, the"
11418,ARGUMENT.,enemy being yet at a distance; but when the equally-plied barks of the
11419,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks had arrived, he came back to Troy, and was distinguished amongst"
11420,ARGUMENT.,"the Trojans; and he dwelt near Priam, and he honoured him equally with"
11421,ARGUMENT.,his sons. But Hector rebuked him; and spoke and addressed him:
11422,ARGUMENT.,
11423,ARGUMENT.,"“Shall we be thus remiss, O Melanippus? Is not thy heart moved, thy"
11424,ARGUMENT.,kinsman being slain? Dost thou not perceive how busy they are about the
11425,ARGUMENT.,arms of Dolops? But follow; for it is no longer justifiable to fight at
11426,ARGUMENT.,"a distance with the Greeks, before that either we slay them, or that"
11427,ARGUMENT.,"they tear lofty Ilium from its summit, and slay its citizens.” So"
11428,ARGUMENT.,"saying, he led on, and the godlike hero followed with him. But mighty"
11429,ARGUMENT.,Telamonian Ajax aroused the Greeks.
11430,ARGUMENT.,
11431,ARGUMENT.,"“O my friends, be men, and set honour 498 in your hearts, and have"
11432,ARGUMENT.,reverence for each other during the vehement conflicts. For more of
11433,ARGUMENT.,those men who reverence [each other] are saved than slain; but of the
11434,ARGUMENT.,"fugitives, neither glory arises, nor any defence.”"
11435,ARGUMENT.,
11436,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 498: (return)  Cf. v. 530, xiii. 121, with the notes."
11437,ARGUMENT.,
11438,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke, but they too were eager to repel [the enemy]. And they"
11439,ARGUMENT.,"fixed his advice in their mind, and enclosed the ships with a brazen"
11440,ARGUMENT.,"fence; but Jove urged on the Trojans. And Menelaus, brave in the din of"
11441,ARGUMENT.,"battle, incited Antilochus:"
11442,ARGUMENT.,
11443,ARGUMENT.,"“O Antilochus, no other of the Greeks is younger than thou, nor swifter"
11444,ARGUMENT.,"of foot, nor strong, as thou [art], to fight. Would 499 that, attacking"
11445,ARGUMENT.,"some hero of the Trojans, thou couldst wound him.”"
11446,ARGUMENT.,
11447,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 499: (return)  Εἰ is put for εἴθε.
11448,ARGUMENT.,
11449,ARGUMENT.,"So saying, he on his part withdrew again, and he aroused him. But he"
11450,ARGUMENT.,"(Antilochus) leaped forth from amongst the foremost warriors, and took"
11451,ARGUMENT.,"aim with his shining spear, gazing around him; but the Trojans retired,"
11452,ARGUMENT.,"the hero hurling. But he did not cast his weapon in vain, for he struck"
11453,ARGUMENT.,"magnanimous Melanippus, the son of Hicetaon, in the breast, near the"
11454,ARGUMENT.,"pap, advancing to the battle. And falling, he made a crash, and his"
11455,ARGUMENT.,"arms rang upon him. But Antilochus sprang upon him, as a dog that"
11456,ARGUMENT.,"rushes on a wounded fawn, which the huntsman aiming at, has wounded,"
11457,ARGUMENT.,"leaping from its lair, and relaxed its limbs under it. Thus, O"
11458,ARGUMENT.,"Melanippus, did warlike Antilochus spring on thee, about to despoil"
11459,ARGUMENT.,"thee of thy armour: but he did not escape noble Hector, who came"
11460,ARGUMENT.,"against him, running through the battle. But Antilochus did not await"
11461,ARGUMENT.,"him, though being an expert warrior, but he fled, like unto a wild"
11462,ARGUMENT.,"beast that has done some mischief, which, having slain a dog or"
11463,ARGUMENT.,"herdsman in charge of oxen, flies, before a crowd of men is assembled:"
11464,ARGUMENT.,"so fled the son of Nestor; but the Trojans and Hector, with great"
11465,ARGUMENT.,"clamour, poured forth their deadly weapons. Yet when he reached the"
11466,ARGUMENT.,"band of his own companions, being turned round, he stood. But the"
11467,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans, like raw-devouring lions, rushed upon the ships, and were"
11468,ARGUMENT.,fulfilling the commands of Jove; who ever kept exciting their great
11469,ARGUMENT.,"strength, and enervated the courage of the Greeks, and took away their"
11470,ARGUMENT.,glory; but encouraged those. For his mind wished to bestow glory on
11471,ARGUMENT.,"Hector, the son of Priam, that he might cast the dreadfully-burning,"
11472,ARGUMENT.,indefatigable fire upon the crooked barks; and accomplish all the
11473,ARGUMENT.,unseasonable prayer of Thetis.
11474,ARGUMENT.,
11475,ARGUMENT.,"For this did provident Jove await, till he should behold with his eyes"
11476,ARGUMENT.,the flame of a burning vessel; for from that time he was about to make
11477,ARGUMENT.,"a retreat of the Trojans from the ships, and to afford glory to the"
11478,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks. Designing these things, he aroused Hector, the son of Priam,"
11479,ARGUMENT.,"against the hollow ships, although himself very eager. But he raged, as"
11480,ARGUMENT.,"when Mars [rages], brandishing his spear, or [when] a destructive fire"
11481,ARGUMENT.,"rages in the mountains, in the thickets of a deep wood. And foam arose"
11482,ARGUMENT.,"about his mouth, and his eyes flashed from beneath his grim eyebrows;"
11483,ARGUMENT.,"and the helm was shaken awfully upon the temples of Hector, fighting;"
11484,ARGUMENT.,"for Jove himself from the æther was an assistant to him, and honoured"
11485,ARGUMENT.,and glorified him alone amongst many men; because he was destined to be
11486,ARGUMENT.,short-lived: for Pallas Minerva already impelled him towards the fatal
11487,ARGUMENT.,"day, by the might of the son of Peleus. And he wished to break the"
11488,ARGUMENT.,"ranks of heroes, trying them, wheresoever he beheld the greatest crowd"
11489,ARGUMENT.,"and the best arms. But not thus was he able to break through them,"
11490,ARGUMENT.,"although very eager; for they, compact in squares, sustained his"
11491,ARGUMENT.,"attack, as a lofty, huge cliff, being near the hoary deep, which abides"
11492,ARGUMENT.,"the impetuous inroads of the shrill winds, and the swollen billows"
11493,ARGUMENT.,which are dashed against it. Thus the Greeks firmly awaited the
11494,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans, nor fled. But he, gleaming with fire on all sides, rushed upon"
11495,ARGUMENT.,"the crowd; and fell upon them, as when an impetuous wave, wind-nurtured"
11496,ARGUMENT.,"from the clouds, dashes against a swift ship, and it [the ship] is"
11497,ARGUMENT.,"wholly enveloped with the spray, and a dreadful blast of wind roars"
11498,ARGUMENT.,"within the sail: but the sailors tremble in mind, fearing, because they"
11499,ARGUMENT.,are borne but a little way from death: thus was the mind of the Greeks
11500,ARGUMENT.,"divided in their breasts. He, however, like a destructive lion coming"
11501,ARGUMENT.,upon oxen which feed in myriads in the moist ground of a spacious
11502,ARGUMENT.,"marsh, and amongst them a keeper not very skilful in fighting with a"
11503,ARGUMENT.,wild beast for the slaughter of a crooked-horned ox; 500 he indeed
11504,ARGUMENT.,"always accompanies the foremost or the hindmost cattle, whilst [the"
11505,ARGUMENT.,"lion] springing into the midst, devours an ox, and all the rest fly in"
11506,ARGUMENT.,terror; thus then were the Greeks wondrously put to flight by Hector
11507,ARGUMENT.,"and father Jove, all—but [Hector] slew only Mycenæan Periphetes, the"
11508,ARGUMENT.,"dear son of Copreus, who went with a messenger of king Eurystheus to"
11509,ARGUMENT.,mighty Hercules. From this far inferior father sprung a son superior in
11510,ARGUMENT.,"all kinds of accomplishments, as well in the race as in the combat, and"
11511,ARGUMENT.,"who in prudence was among the first of the Mycenæans, who at that time"
11512,ARGUMENT.,"gave into the hands of Hector superior glory. For, turning backwards,"
11513,ARGUMENT.,"he trod upon the rim of his shield which he bore, a fence against"
11514,ARGUMENT.,"javelins, which reached to his feet; by this incommoded, he fell upon"
11515,ARGUMENT.,"his back, and the helmet terribly sounded round the temples of him"
11516,ARGUMENT.,"fallen. But Hector quickly perceived, and running, stood near him, and"
11517,ARGUMENT.,"fixed his spear in his breast, and slew him near his beloved"
11518,ARGUMENT.,"companions, nor indeed were they able, although grieved for their"
11519,ARGUMENT.,"comrade, to avail him, for they themselves greatly feared noble Hector."
11520,ARGUMENT.,"But they retreated within the line of their ships, 501 and the extreme"
11521,ARGUMENT.,"ships enclosed them, which were first drawn up: and the others were"
11522,ARGUMENT.,"poured in. The Argives, therefore, from necessity, retreated from the"
11523,ARGUMENT.,"foremost vessels, and remained there at their tents in close array, and"
11524,ARGUMENT.,"were not dispersed through the camp, for shame and fear restrained"
11525,ARGUMENT.,"them, and they unceasingly exhorted one another with shouting. More"
11526,ARGUMENT.,"particularly did Gerenian Nestor, the guardian of the Greeks, adjure"
11527,ARGUMENT.,"them by their parents, earnestly supplicating each man:"
11528,ARGUMENT.,
11529,ARGUMENT.,"“O my friends, be men, and place a sense of reverence 502 of other men"
11530,ARGUMENT.,"in your minds. Call to memory, each of you, your children, wives,"
11531,ARGUMENT.,"property, and parents, as well he to whom they survive as he to whom"
11532,ARGUMENT.,they are dead; for by those not present I here supplicate you to stand
11533,ARGUMENT.,"bravely, nor be ye turned to flight.” So saying, he aroused the might"
11534,ARGUMENT.,and spirit of each. But for them Minerva removed the heaven-sent cloud
11535,ARGUMENT.,of darkness from their eyes; and abundant light arose to them on both
11536,ARGUMENT.,"sides, both towards the ships and towards the equally destructive"
11537,ARGUMENT.,"battle. Then they observed Hector, brave in the din of battle, and his"
11538,ARGUMENT.,"companions, as well whatever of them stood behind and did not fight as"
11539,ARGUMENT.,those who fought the battle at the swift ships. Nor was it longer
11540,ARGUMENT.,pleasing to the mind of great-hearted Ajax to stand there where the
11541,ARGUMENT.,other sons of the Greeks stood together; but he went about upon the
11542,ARGUMENT.,"decks of the vessels, taking long strides, and wielding in his hands a"
11543,ARGUMENT.,"great sea-fighting pole, studded with iron nails, twenty-two cubits"
11544,ARGUMENT.,"long. And as when a man well skilled in vaulting upon steeds, who,"
11545,ARGUMENT.,"after he has selected four horses out of a greater number, driving them"
11546,ARGUMENT.,"from the plain, urges them towards a mighty city, along the public way;"
11547,ARGUMENT.,"and him many men and women behold with admiration; but he, always"
11548,ARGUMENT.,"leaping up firmly and safely, changes alternately from one to the"
11549,ARGUMENT.,"other, 503 whilst they are flying along: so went Ajax along many decks"
11550,ARGUMENT.,"of swift ships, shouting loudly, and his voice reached to the sky; and,"
11551,ARGUMENT.,"always terribly shouting, he ordered the Greeks to defend their ships"
11552,ARGUMENT.,"and tents. Nor, indeed, did Hector remain among the crowd of"
11553,ARGUMENT.,well-corsleted Trojans; but as the tawny eagle pounces upon a flock of
11554,ARGUMENT.,"winged birds, feeding on a river’s bank, either geese or cranes, or"
11555,ARGUMENT.,"long-necked swans, so did Hector direct his course towards an"
11556,ARGUMENT.,"azure-prowed vessel, rushing against it; but Jove, with a very mighty"
11557,ARGUMENT.,"hand, impelled him from behind, and animated his forces along with him."
11558,ARGUMENT.,Again was a sharp contest waged at the ships. You would have said that
11559,ARGUMENT.,"unwearied and indefatigable they met each other in battle, so furiously"
11560,ARGUMENT.,"they fought. And to them fighting this was the opinion: the Greeks,"
11561,ARGUMENT.,"indeed, thought that they could not escape from destruction, but must"
11562,ARGUMENT.,"perish. But the soul of each within his breast, to the Trojans, hoped"
11563,ARGUMENT.,"to burn the ships, and slay the Grecian heroes. They thinking these"
11564,ARGUMENT.,"things, opposed one another."

11589,ARGUMENT.,"black-hilted, with massive handles, fell to the ground, some indeed"
11590,ARGUMENT.,"from the hands, and others from the shoulders of the contending heroes;"
11591,ARGUMENT.,"and the dark earth streamed with gore. But Hector, after he had seized"
11592,ARGUMENT.,"[the vessel] by the stern, did not let go, holding the furthest 505"
11593,ARGUMENT.,"edge with his hands, and he cheered on the Trojans:"
11594,ARGUMENT.,
11595,ARGUMENT.,"“Bring fire, and at the same time do yourselves together excite the"
11596,ARGUMENT.,"battle. Now hath Jove vouchsafed us a day worth all, 506 to take the"
11597,ARGUMENT.,"ships, which, coming hither against the will of the gods, brought many"
11598,ARGUMENT.,"evils upon us through the cowardice of our elders, who kept me back"
11599,ARGUMENT.,"when desirous myself to fight at the sterns of the ships, and"
11600,ARGUMENT.,"restrained the people. But if, indeed, far-sounding Jove then injured"
11601,ARGUMENT.,"507 our minds, he now impels and orders us.” Thus he spoke, but they"
11602,ARGUMENT.,"rushed the more against the Greeks. Even Ajax no longer sustained them,"
11603,ARGUMENT.,"for he was overwhelmed with darts; but, thinking he should fall,"
11604,ARGUMENT.,"retired back a short space to the seven-feet bench, and deserted the"
11605,ARGUMENT.,"deck of his equal ship. There he stood watching, and with his spear"
11606,ARGUMENT.,"continually repulsed the Trojans from the ships, whoever might bring"
11607,ARGUMENT.,"the indefatigable fire; and always shouting dreadfully, he animated the"
11608,ARGUMENT.,Greeks:

11610,ARGUMENT.,"“O my friends, Grecian heroes, servants of Mars, be men, my friends,"

11612,ARGUMENT.,"any assistants in the rear, or any stronger rampart which may avert"
11613,ARGUMENT.,"destruction from the men? Indeed there is not any other city near,"
11614,ARGUMENT.,"fortified with towers, where we may be defended, having a reinforcing"
11615,ARGUMENT.,"army; but bordering on the sea, we sit in the plain of the well-armed"
11616,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans, far away from our native land; therefore safety is in our"
11617,ARGUMENT.,"exertions, not in remission of battle.”"
11618,ARGUMENT.,
11619,ARGUMENT.,"He said, and furious, charged with his sharp spear whoever of the"
11620,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans was borne towards the hollow ships with burning fire, for the"

11652,ARGUMENT.,"Ajax, routs the Trojans, and kills Sarpedon, whose body, but without"

11666,ARGUMENT.,
11667,ARGUMENT.,"“Why weepest thou, O Patroclus, as an infant girl, who, running along"

11669,ARGUMENT.,"and detains her hastening; and weeping, looks at her [mother] till she"
11670,ARGUMENT.,"is taken up?—like unto her, O Patroclus, dost thou shed the tender"
11671,ARGUMENT.,"tear. Dost thou bear any tidings to the Myrmidons, or to me myself? Or"

11730,ARGUMENT.,"has king Agamemnon, son of Atreus, taken back out of my hands, as from"
11731,ARGUMENT.,some dishonoured alien. But we shall allow these things to be among the
11732,ARGUMENT.,"things that were; 512 nor is it right, indeed, to be continually"
11733,ARGUMENT.,enraged in one’s mind. Certainly I affirmed that I would not put a stop
11734,ARGUMENT.,"to my wrath, before that clamour and war should reach my ships. But do"
11735,ARGUMENT.,"thou put on thy shoulders my famous armour, and lead on the war-loving"
11736,ARGUMENT.,Myrmidons to battle; since now a black cloud of Trojans hath strongly
11737,ARGUMENT.,"surrounded the ships, and the Greeks are hemmed in by the shore of the"

11739,ARGUMENT.,"the Trojans has rushed on, confident, because they behold not the front"
11740,ARGUMENT.,"of my helmet gleaming near. Certainly, quickly flying, would they have"
11741,ARGUMENT.,"filled the trenches with their bodies, if king Agamemnon had known"
11742,ARGUMENT.,mildness to me: but now they are fighting around the army. For the
11743,ARGUMENT.,"spear does not rage in the hands of Diomede, the son of Tydeus, to"
11744,ARGUMENT.,avert destruction from the Greeks: nor do I at all hear the voice of
11745,ARGUMENT.,Agamemnon shouting from his odious head; but [the voice] of
11746,ARGUMENT.,"man-slaughtering Hector, animating the Trojans, resounds: whilst they"
11747,ARGUMENT.,"with a shout possess the whole plain, conquering the Greeks in battle."
11748,ARGUMENT.,"Yet even thus, Patroclus, do thou fall on them bravely, warding off"
11749,ARGUMENT.,destruction from the ships; nor let them consume the vessels with
11750,ARGUMENT.,"blazing fire, and cut off thy own return. But obey, as I shall lay the"

11752,ARGUMENT.,great honour and glory from all the Greeks; and they may send back to
11753,ARGUMENT.,"me the beautiful maid, and afford [me] besides rich presents. Having"

11755,ARGUMENT.,"loud-thundering husband of Juno permit thee to obtain glory, do not be"
11756,ARGUMENT.,desirous of fighting with the warlike Trojans apart from me; for thou
11757,ARGUMENT.,"wouldst render me more dishonoured; nor, exulting in the battle and"
11758,ARGUMENT.,"havoc, lead on as far as Ilium, slaughtering the Trojans, lest some of"
11759,ARGUMENT.,the immortal gods come down from Olympus [against thee]; for
11760,ARGUMENT.,far-darting Apollo greatly loves them. But return after thou hast given

11803,ARGUMENT.,deeds of the gods; because the lofty thundering Jove cut off his plans
11804,ARGUMENT.,"of war, and willed the victory to the Trojans. Wherefore he retired out"

11806,ARGUMENT.,"the swift ships, the inextinguishable flame of which was immediately"
11807,ARGUMENT.,diffused around. Thus indeed the flame surrounded the stern; but
11808,ARGUMENT.,"Achilles, smiting his thighs, addressed Patroclus:"

11812,ARGUMENT.,and there be not an opportunity of flying; put on thy armour very
11813,ARGUMENT.,"quickly, and I shall assemble the forces.”"
11814,ARGUMENT.,
11815,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but Patroclus armed himself in glittering brass. First,"
11816,ARGUMENT.,"indeed, he put the beautiful greaves around his legs, fitted with"
11817,ARGUMENT.,clasps; next he placed the corslet of the swift-footed descendant of
11818,ARGUMENT.,"Æacus upon his breast, variegated, and studded with stars; and"
11819,ARGUMENT.,"suspended from his shoulders his silver-studded sword, brazen, and then"
11820,ARGUMENT.,the great and sturdy shield. But upon his gallant head he placed the
11821,ARGUMENT.,"well-made helmet, crested with horse-hair; and dreadfully the plume"
11822,ARGUMENT.,"nodded from above. He took besides two strong spears, which well fitted"
11823,ARGUMENT.,"his hands; but the spear alone of blameless Æacides, ponderous, large,"
11824,ARGUMENT.,"and strong, he did not take; which, indeed, no other of the Greeks"
11825,ARGUMENT.,"could brandish, but Achilles alone knew how to wield it; a Pelian ash"
11826,ARGUMENT.,"which Chiron had given to his sire, [cut] from the tops of Pelion,"
11827,ARGUMENT.,about to be death to heroes. He also commanded Automedon quickly to
11828,ARGUMENT.,"yoke the steeds, whom, next to rank-breaking Achilles, he most"
11829,ARGUMENT.,"honoured, because he was most faithful to him in battle, to stand the"
11830,ARGUMENT.,"charge. Wherefore Automedon yoked the fleet horses, Xanthus and Balius,"
11831,ARGUMENT.,which kept pace with the winds. Them the Harpy Podargé bore to
11832,ARGUMENT.,"Zephyrus, the wind, while feeding in the meadows by the stream of"
11833,ARGUMENT.,"Oceanus. And in the outer harness he fastened illustrious Pedasus, whom"
11834,ARGUMENT.,"Achilles led away long since, having sacked the city of Eëtion; and"
11835,ARGUMENT.,"which [steed], though being mortal, accompanied immortal steeds. But"
11836,ARGUMENT.,"Achilles, going about, armed all the Myrmidons through the tents with"
11837,ARGUMENT.,"their armour; but they, like carnivorous wolves, in whose hearts is"
11838,ARGUMENT.,"immense strength, and which, having slain a great horned stag in the"
11839,ARGUMENT.,"mountains, tearing, devour it; but the jaws of all are red with blood:"
11840,ARGUMENT.,"and then they rush in a pack, lapping with slender tongues the surface"
11841,ARGUMENT.,"of the dark water from a black-water fountain, vomiting forth clots of"
11842,ARGUMENT.,"blood; but the courage in their breasts is dauntless, and their stomach"
11843,ARGUMENT.,is distended: so rushed the leaders and chiefs of the Myrmidons round
11844,ARGUMENT.,"the brave attendant of swift-footed Æacides, and amongst them stood"
11845,ARGUMENT.,"warlike Achilles, animating both the steeds and the shield-bearing"
11846,ARGUMENT.,warriors.
11847,ARGUMENT.,
11848,ARGUMENT.,"Fifty were the swift galleys which Achilles, dear to Jove, led to Troy;"
11849,ARGUMENT.,"and in each were fifty men, companions at the benches. But he had"
11850,ARGUMENT.,"appointed five leaders, in whom he put trust, to command them; and he"
11851,ARGUMENT.,"himself, being very powerful, governed. One troop indeed Menesthius,"
11852,ARGUMENT.,"with flexible corslet, commanded, the son of Sperchius, a"
11853,ARGUMENT.,"Jove-descended river; whom the daughter of Peleus, fair Polydora, bore"
11854,ARGUMENT.,"to indefatigable Sperchius, a woman having been embraced by a god;"
11855,ARGUMENT.,"although, according to report, to Borus, son of Perieres, who openly"
11856,ARGUMENT.,"espoused her, giving infinite marriage gifts. But warlike Eudorus"
11857,ARGUMENT.,"commanded another [company], clandestinely begotten, whom Polymela, the"
11858,ARGUMENT.,"daughter of Phylas, graceful in the dance, bore. Her the powerful"
11859,ARGUMENT.,"slayer of Argus 514 loved, beholding her with his eyes among the"
11860,ARGUMENT.,"dancers at a choir of golden-bowed Diana, huntress-maid; and"
11861,ARGUMENT.,"immediately ascending to an upper chamber, pacific Mercury secretly lay"
11862,ARGUMENT.,"with her: whence she bore to him a son, Eudorus, swift to run, and also"
11863,ARGUMENT.,a warrior. But after that birth-presiding Ilithyia had brought him into
11864,ARGUMENT.,"light, and he beheld the splendour of the sun, the mighty strength of"
11865,ARGUMENT.,"Echecleus, son of Actor, led her to his house when he had given"
11866,ARGUMENT.,innumerable marriage-gifts; whilst aged Phylas carefully nurtured and
11867,ARGUMENT.,"educated him, tenderly loving him, as if being his own son. The third,"
11868,ARGUMENT.,"warlike Pisander led, the son of Mæmalus, who, after the companion of"
11869,ARGUMENT.,"the son of Peleus, surpassed all the Myrmidons in fighting with the"
11870,ARGUMENT.,"spear. The fourth, the aged knight Phœnix commanded; and Alcimedon, the"
11871,ARGUMENT.,"illustrious son of Laërceus, the fifth. But when Achilles, marshalling"
11872,ARGUMENT.,"them well, had placed all with their leaders, he enjoined this strict"
11873,ARGUMENT.,command:
11874,ARGUMENT.,
11875,ARGUMENT.,"“Ye Myrmidons, let none of you be forgetful of the threats with which,"
11876,ARGUMENT.,"at the swift ships, ye did threaten the Trojans, during all my"
11877,ARGUMENT.,"indignation, and blamed me, each of you [in this manner]: ‘O cruel son"
11878,ARGUMENT.,of Peleus! surely thy mother nurtured thee in wrath: relentless! thou
11879,ARGUMENT.,who at the ships detainest thy companions against their will. Let us at
11880,ARGUMENT.,"least return home again in our sea-traversing barks, since pernicious"
11881,ARGUMENT.,wrath has thus fallen upon thy mind.’ These things ye frequently said
11882,ARGUMENT.,"to me, when assembled; and now the great task of war appears, of which"
11883,ARGUMENT.,"ye were hitherto desirous. Let each one here, having a valiant heart,"
11884,ARGUMENT.,fight against the Trojans.”

11887,ARGUMENT.,
11888,ARGUMENT.,"Thus speaking, he aroused the might and spirit of each, and their ranks"
11889,ARGUMENT.,were condensed the more when they heard the king. As when a man
11890,ARGUMENT.,"constructs the wall of a lofty mansion with closely-joined stones,"
11891,ARGUMENT.,"guarding against the violence of the winds, so closely were their"
11892,ARGUMENT.,"helmets and bossed shields linked: then shield pressed upon shield,"
11893,ARGUMENT.,"helmet upon helmet, and man upon man; and the horse-hair crests upon"
11894,ARGUMENT.,"the shining cones of [their helmets] nodding, touched each other; so"
11895,ARGUMENT.,close stood they to each other. Before all were armed two warriors.
11896,ARGUMENT.,"Patroclus and Automedon, having one mind, to fight in the front of the"
11897,ARGUMENT.,Myrmidons. But Achilles hastened to go into his tent; and he opened the
11898,ARGUMENT.,"lid of a chest, beautiful, variously adorned, which silver-footed"
11899,ARGUMENT.,"Thetis placed, to be carried in his ship, having filled it well with"
11900,ARGUMENT.,"garments, and wind-resisting cloaks, and napped tapestry. And in it was"
11901,ARGUMENT.,"a cup curiously wrought, nor did any other of men drink dark wine from"
11902,ARGUMENT.,"it, nor did he pour out [from it] libations to any of the gods, except"
11903,ARGUMENT.,"to father Jove. This then, taking from the coffer, he first purified"
11904,ARGUMENT.,"with sulphur, and then washed in a crystal rivulet of water; but he"
11905,ARGUMENT.,"himself washed his hands, and drew off the dark wine. Next, standing in"
11906,ARGUMENT.,"the middle of the area, he prayed, and offered a libation of wine,"
11907,ARGUMENT.,looking up to heaven; nor did he escape the notice of thunder-rejoicing

11929,ARGUMENT.,"the Sire granted him, but refused the other. He granted that he should"
11930,ARGUMENT.,"repel the conflict and tumult from the ships, but he refused that he"
11931,ARGUMENT.,"should return safe from the battle. He, on his part, having made a"
11932,ARGUMENT.,"libation and prayed to father Jove, again entered his tent, and"
11933,ARGUMENT.,"replaced the cup in the chest. Then coming out, he stood before the"
11934,ARGUMENT.,"tent, for he still wished in his mind to behold the grievous conflict"
11935,ARGUMENT.,of Trojans and Greeks.
11936,ARGUMENT.,
11937,ARGUMENT.,"But those that were armed at the same time with magnanimous Patroclus,"
11938,ARGUMENT.,"marched orderly, till they rushed upon the Trojans, with high hopes."
11939,ARGUMENT.,"Immediately they were poured out, like unto wasps dwelling by the"
11940,ARGUMENT.,"road-side, which silly boys are wont to irritate, incessantly harassing"
11941,ARGUMENT.,"them, possessing cells by the way-side; and cause a common evil to"
11942,ARGUMENT.,"many. And if by chance any traveller, passing by, unintentionally"
11943,ARGUMENT.,"disturb them, then they, possessing a valiant heart, all fly forth, and"
11944,ARGUMENT.,"fight for their young. The Myrmidons then, having the heart and courage"
11945,ARGUMENT.,"of these, poured out from the ships, and an inextinguishable tumult"
11946,ARGUMENT.,"arose. But Patroclus cheered on his companions, loudly shouting:"
11947,ARGUMENT.,
11948,ARGUMENT.,"“Ye Myrmidons, companions of Achilles, the son of Peleus, be men, my"
11949,ARGUMENT.,"friends, and be mindful of impetuous valour; that we, his"
11950,ARGUMENT.,"close-fighting servants, may honour the son of Peleus, who is by far"
11951,ARGUMENT.,"the bravest of the Greeks at the ships; and that the son of Atreus,"
11952,ARGUMENT.,"wide-ruling Agamemnon, may know his fault, that he nothing honoured the"
11953,ARGUMENT.,bravest of the Greeks.”
11954,ARGUMENT.,
11955,ARGUMENT.,"Thus speaking, he aroused the might and spirits of each: and in dense"
11956,ARGUMENT.,array they fell upon the Trojans: but the ships re-echoed dreadfully
11957,ARGUMENT.,"around from the Greeks shouting. But the Trojans, when they beheld the"
11958,ARGUMENT.,"brave son of Menœtius, himself and his attendant glittering in arms,"
11959,ARGUMENT.,"the mind to all of them was disturbed, and the phalanxes were deranged,"
11960,ARGUMENT.,deeming that the swift-footed son of Peleus at the ships had cast away
11961,ARGUMENT.,"his wrath, and resumed friendship: then each one gazed about where he"
11962,ARGUMENT.,might escape utter destruction.
11963,ARGUMENT.,
11964,ARGUMENT.,But Patroclus first took aim with his shining spear from the opposite
11965,ARGUMENT.,"side right into the midst, where they were huddled together in greatest"
11966,ARGUMENT.,"numbers at the stern of the ship of magnanimous Protesilaus, and"
11967,ARGUMENT.,"wounded Pyræchmes, who led the Pæonian equestrian warriors from Amydon,"
11968,ARGUMENT.,"from the wide-flowing Axius. Him he smote upon the right shoulder, and"
11969,ARGUMENT.,"he fell on his back in the dust groaning; but the Pæonians, his"
11970,ARGUMENT.,"companions, were put to flight around him, for Patroclus caused fear to"
11971,ARGUMENT.,"them all, having slain their leader, who was very brave to fight. And"
11972,ARGUMENT.,"he drove them from the ships, and extinguished the blazing fire. But"
11973,ARGUMENT.,"the ship was left there half-burnt, whilst the Trojans were routed with"
11974,ARGUMENT.,a prodigious tumult: and the Greeks were poured forth amongst the
11975,ARGUMENT.,"hollow ships; and mighty confusion was created. And as when, from the"
11976,ARGUMENT.,"lofty summit of a great mountain, 516 lightning-driving Jove dislodges"
11977,ARGUMENT.,"a dense cloud, and all the eminences and highest ridges and glens"
11978,ARGUMENT.,"appear, whilst the boundless æther is burst open 517 throughout the"
11979,ARGUMENT.,"heaven; so the Greeks respired for a little, having repelled the"
11980,ARGUMENT.,hostile fire from their vessels. But of battle there was no cessation:
11981,ARGUMENT.,for the Trojans were by no means yet totally routed from the black
11982,ARGUMENT.,"ships by the warlike Greeks, but still resisted, and retreated from the"
11983,ARGUMENT.,"ships from necessity. Then of the generals, man slew man, the fight"
11984,ARGUMENT.,"being scattered; and first, the brave son of Menœtius forthwith with"
11985,ARGUMENT.,"his sharp spear smote the thigh of Areïlochus when turned about, and"
11986,ARGUMENT.,"drove the brass quite through: but the spear broke the bone, and he"
11987,ARGUMENT.,fell prone upon the earth. But warlike Menelaus then wounded Thoas in
11988,ARGUMENT.,"the breast, exposed near the shield, and relaxed his limbs. But"
11989,ARGUMENT.,"Phylides, perceiving Amphiclus rushing against him, anticipated him,"
11990,ARGUMENT.,"taking aim at the extremity of his leg, where the calf of a man is"
11991,ARGUMENT.,thickest; the tendons were severed all round 518 by the point of the
11992,ARGUMENT.,"spear, and darkness overshadowed his eyes. Then the sons of Nestor, the"
11993,ARGUMENT.,"one, Antilochus, struck Atymnius with his sharp spear, and drove the"
11994,ARGUMENT.,"brazen lance through his flank; and he fell before him: but Maris,"
11995,ARGUMENT.,"standing before the carcase, rushed upon Antilochus hand to hand with"
11996,ARGUMENT.,"his spear, enraged on account of his brother; but godlike Thrasymedes,"
11997,ARGUMENT.,"taking aim, anticipated him before he had wounded [Antilochus], nor did"
11998,ARGUMENT.,"he miss him, [but wounded him] immediately near the shoulder; and the"
11999,ARGUMENT.,"point of the spear cut off the extremity of the arm from the muscles,"
12000,ARGUMENT.,"and completely tore away the bone. Falling, he made a crash, and"
12001,ARGUMENT.,"darkness veiled his eyes. Thus to Erebus went these two, subdued by two"
12002,ARGUMENT.,"brothers, the brave companions of Sarpedon, the spear-renowned sons of"
12003,ARGUMENT.,"Amisodarus, who nourished the invincible 519 Chimæra, a destruction to"
12004,ARGUMENT.,"many men. But Ajax, the son of Oïleus, rushing upon Cleobulus, took him"
12005,ARGUMENT.,"alive, impeded in the crowd; and there relaxed his strength, striking"
12006,ARGUMENT.,him upon the neck with his hilted sword. And the whole sword was warmed

12227,ARGUMENT.,"the right shoulder; but he groaned, breathing out his life, and fell in"
12228,ARGUMENT.,"the dust, moaning, and his spirit fled from him. But the two [other"
12229,ARGUMENT.,"steeds] leaped asunder, and the yoke crashed, and the reins were"
12230,ARGUMENT.,"entangled about them, when the side horse lay in the dust. But"
12231,ARGUMENT.,spear-renowned Automedon found an end of this. Drawing his long sword
12232,ARGUMENT.,"from his robust thigh, rising, he cut away the farther horse, nor did"
12233,ARGUMENT.,"he act slothfully. And the two [remaining horses] were set aright, and"
12234,ARGUMENT.,were directed by the reins; and they [the men] again engage in
12235,ARGUMENT.,life-devouring combat.
12236,ARGUMENT.,
12237,ARGUMENT.,"Then again Sarpedon missed [him] with his shining spear, and the point"
12238,ARGUMENT.,"of the weapon passed over the left shoulder of Patroclus, nor did it"
12239,ARGUMENT.,"wound him. But Patroclus rushed on with his javelin, and the weapon did"
12240,ARGUMENT.,"not escape in vain from his hand, for he struck him where the midriff"
12241,ARGUMENT.,"encloses the compact 532 heart. And he fell, as when falls some oak, or"
12242,ARGUMENT.,"poplar, or lofty pine, which the workmen fell in the mountains with"
12243,ARGUMENT.,"newly-sharpened axes, to be a naval timber: so he lay stretched out"
12244,ARGUMENT.,"before his horses and chariot, gnashing with his teeth, grasping the"
12245,ARGUMENT.,"bloody dust. As a lion slays a bull, coming among a herd, tawny,"
12246,ARGUMENT.,"noble-spirited, among the stamping 533 oxen, and he perishes,"
12247,ARGUMENT.,"bellowing, beneath the jaws of the lion; so the leader of the shielded"
12248,ARGUMENT.,"Lycians was indignant, 534 being slain by Patroclus, and addressed his"
12249,ARGUMENT.,dear companion by name:

12254,ARGUMENT.,"_dense_ or _compact_, which physical idea the word retains, according"
12255,ARGUMENT.,"to the Homeric usage, in Od. τ. 516, as a fixed epithet of the heart,"

12262,ARGUMENT.,xii. Ult. “Vitaque cum gemitu fugit indignata sub umbras.”
12263,ARGUMENT.,
12264,ARGUMENT.,"“Glaucus, dear friend, warrior amongst heroes, now it greatly behoves"
12265,ARGUMENT.,"thee to be a hero and a bold warrior; now if thou art impetuous, let"
12266,ARGUMENT.,"destructive battle be thy desire. First indeed, going in every"
12267,ARGUMENT.,"direction, exhort the leaders of the Lycians to fight around Sarpedon,"
12268,ARGUMENT.,and do thou thyself also fight for me with thy spear. For I will
12269,ARGUMENT.,"hereafter be a cause of shame and disgrace to thee, all thy days,"
12270,ARGUMENT.,"throughout, if indeed the Greeks despoil me of my armour, falling in"
12271,ARGUMENT.,"the conflict at the ships. But persevere, and animate all the army.”"
12272,ARGUMENT.,
12273,ARGUMENT.,"While he was thus speaking, the end of death covered him as to his eyes"
12274,ARGUMENT.,"and nostrils; but Patroclus, trampling with his heel upon his breast,"
12275,ARGUMENT.,"drew out the spear from his body, and the midriff 535 followed with it;"
12276,ARGUMENT.,and he drew out at the same time his life and the point of the weapon.
12277,ARGUMENT.,"But the Myrmidons there held his panting steeds, eager to fly along,"
12278,ARGUMENT.,since they had quitted the chariots of their lords. Then bitter grief
12279,ARGUMENT.,"arose to Glaucus, hearing the voice [of his friend], and his heart was"
12280,ARGUMENT.,grieved because he could not aid him. But grasping his own arm in his
12281,ARGUMENT.,"hand, he compressed it; for grievously the wound pained him, which"
12282,ARGUMENT.,"Teucer, with an arrow, had inflicted upon him, as he was rushing"
12283,ARGUMENT.,"against the lofty wall, warding off the battle from his companions."
12284,ARGUMENT.,"Wherefore, praying, he addressed far-darting Apollo:"
12285,ARGUMENT.,

12287,ARGUMENT.,
12288,ARGUMENT.,"“Hear, O king, thou who art somewhere in the rich state of Lycia, or in"
12289,ARGUMENT.,"Troy; for thou canst everywhere hear a man afflicted, as sorrow now"
12290,ARGUMENT.,"comes upon me. For indeed I have this grievous wound, and my hand is"
12291,ARGUMENT.,"penetrated on every side with acute pains, nor can the blood be"
12292,ARGUMENT.,"stanched, but my shoulder is oppressed with it. For neither can I"
12293,ARGUMENT.,"firmly I hold my spear, nor, advancing, fight with the enemy; moreover"
12294,ARGUMENT.,"a very brave hero has fallen, Sarpedon, the son of Jove; but he aids"
12295,ARGUMENT.,"not even his own son. But heal for me this severe wound, O king;"
12296,ARGUMENT.,"assuage my pains, and grant me strength, that, cheering on my"
12297,ARGUMENT.,"companions, the Lycians, I may urge them to fight; and may myself fight"
12298,ARGUMENT.,for the dead body.”
12299,ARGUMENT.,
12300,ARGUMENT.,Thus he spoke praying; but Phœbus Apollo heard him. Immediately he
12301,ARGUMENT.,"allayed the pains, and dried the black gore from the grievous wound,"
12302,ARGUMENT.,"and instilled strength into his soul. But Glaucus knew in his mind, and"
12303,ARGUMENT.,rejoiced because the mighty god had quickly heard him praying. First
12304,ARGUMENT.,"then, going about in all directions, he aroused the heroes, leaders of"
12305,ARGUMENT.,"the Lycians, to fight for Sarpedon; and then he went to the Trojans,"
12306,ARGUMENT.,"advancing with long strides to Polydamas, son of Panthous, and noble"
12307,ARGUMENT.,"Agenor. He also went after Æneas and brazen-armed Hector, and, standing"
12308,ARGUMENT.,"near, addressed to him winged words:"
12309,ARGUMENT.,
12310,ARGUMENT.,"“O Hector, now hast thou altogether neglected thine allies, who are"
12311,ARGUMENT.,"losing their lives for thy sake, far away from their friends and"
12312,ARGUMENT.,"father-land; but thou dost not wish to aid them. Sarpedon lies low, the"
12313,ARGUMENT.,"leader of the shield-bearing Lycians, who protected Lycia by his"
12314,ARGUMENT.,justice and his valour. Him hath brazen Mars subdued with a spear at
12315,ARGUMENT.,"the hands of Patroclus. But stand near, my friends, and be indignant in"
12316,ARGUMENT.,"your minds, lest the Myrmidons spoil his armour, and unworthily treat"
12317,ARGUMENT.,"the body, enraged on account of the Greeks, as many as have perished,"
12318,ARGUMENT.,whom we have slain with our spears at the ships.”
12319,ARGUMENT.,
12320,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but intolerable, unyielding grief wholly possessed the"
12321,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans, for he had been a pillar of their city, though being a"
12322,ARGUMENT.,"foreigner; for many forces followed along with him, among whom he"
12323,ARGUMENT.,himself was the most valiant in battle. They therefore advanced eagerly
12324,ARGUMENT.,"straight against the Greeks, ardent with desire; but Hector led the"
12325,ARGUMENT.,"way, enraged on account of Sarpedon. But the valiant heart of"
12326,ARGUMENT.,"Patroclus, son of Menœtius, aroused the Greeks. First he addressed the"
12327,ARGUMENT.,"Ajaces, though they themselves were also eager:"
12328,ARGUMENT.,
12329,ARGUMENT.,"“O Ajaces, now let it be a delightful thing to you both to repel [the"
12330,ARGUMENT.,"foe]; be ye such as of old ye were amongst heroes, or even braver."
12331,ARGUMENT.,"Sarpedon lies low, the man who first broke through 536 the wall of the"
12332,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks. But oh! that taking him, we could treat him with indignity, and"
12333,ARGUMENT.,"spoil the armour from his shoulders, and subdue with the cruel brass"
12334,ARGUMENT.,some one of his companions keeping [us] off from him.”
12335,ARGUMENT.,
12336,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 536: (return)  We must understand him as having done so in
12337,ARGUMENT.,"company with Hector, otherwise this passage would be at variance with"
12338,ARGUMENT.,"xii. 290, 437."
12339,ARGUMENT.,
12340,ARGUMENT.,Thus he spoke; but they also themselves were ready to repel [the foe].
12341,ARGUMENT.,"But when they had strengthened their phalanxes on both sides, the"
12342,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans and Lycians, as well as the Myrmidons and Achæans, they closed"
12343,ARGUMENT.,"to fight round the dead body, shouting dreadfully, and loudly rattled"
12344,ARGUMENT.,the arms of men. But Jove stretched pernicious night over the violent
12345,ARGUMENT.,"contest, that there might be a destructive toil of battle around his"
12346,ARGUMENT.,dear son. The Trojans first drove back the rolling-eyed Greeks; for a
12347,ARGUMENT.,"man was smitten, by no means the most inferior among the Myrmidons,"
12348,ARGUMENT.,"noble Epigeus, son of magnanimous Agacles, who formerly ruled in"
12349,ARGUMENT.,"well-inhabited Budium; but then having slain a noble kinsman, he came"
12350,ARGUMENT.,as a suppliant to Peleus and silver-footed Thetis: they sent him to
12351,ARGUMENT.,"follow with the rank-breaker Achilles, to steed-renowned Ilium, that he"
12352,ARGUMENT.,"might fight with the Trojans. Him then, while seizing the body,"
12353,ARGUMENT.,illustrious Hector struck upon the head with a stone; and it was
12354,ARGUMENT.,entirely split in two in his strong helmet; and he fell prone upon the
12355,ARGUMENT.,"corpse, and soul-destroying death was diffused around him. Then to"
12356,ARGUMENT.,"Patroclus grief arose, on account of his companion slain; and he rushed"
12357,ARGUMENT.,"right through the foremost warriors, like unto a swift hawk, which has"
12358,ARGUMENT.,"put to flight jackdaws or starlings; so, O equestrian Patroclus, didst"
12359,ARGUMENT.,thou rush right against the Lycians and Trojans; for thou wert enraged
12360,ARGUMENT.,"in thine heart for thy companion. And he struck Sthenelaus, the beloved"
12361,ARGUMENT.,"son of Ithæmeneus, on the neck with a stone, and broke his tendons: and"
12362,ARGUMENT.,the foremost warriors and illustrious Hector gave back. And as far as
12363,ARGUMENT.,"is the cast of a long javelin, which a man may have sent forth striving"
12364,ARGUMENT.,"either in the game, or even in war, on account of life-destroying"
12365,ARGUMENT.,"enemies; so far did the Trojans retire, and the Greeks repelled them."
12366,ARGUMENT.,"But Glaucus, the leader of the shield-bearing Lycians, first turned,"
12367,ARGUMENT.,"and slew magnanimous Bathycles, the beloved son of Chalcon, who,"
12368,ARGUMENT.,"inhabiting dwellings in Hellas, was conspicuous among the Myrmidons for"
12369,ARGUMENT.,"his riches and wealth. Him then Glaucus, turning suddenly round,"
12370,ARGUMENT.,"wounded in the middle of the breast with his spear, when, pursuing, he"
12371,ARGUMENT.,had overtaken him. But he made a crash as he fell; and deep grief
12372,ARGUMENT.,"possessed the Greeks, because a brave warrior had thus fallen; but the"
12373,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans greatly rejoiced, and, advancing in crowds, stood round him;"
12374,ARGUMENT.,"nor were the Greeks forgetful of valour, but they directed their"
12375,ARGUMENT.,strength straight against them. Then again Meriones slew a hero of the
12376,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans, the warrior Laogonus, the gallant son of Onetor, who was the"
12377,ARGUMENT.,"priest of Idæan Jove, and was honoured like a god by the people. He"
12378,ARGUMENT.,"smote him under the jaw and ear, and his soul immediately departed from"
12379,ARGUMENT.,"his limbs, and dreadful darkness overshadowed him. 537 But Æneas hurled"
12380,ARGUMENT.,"a brazen spear at Meriones, for he hoped to hit him, advancing under"
12381,ARGUMENT.,"protection of his shield. He, however, observing it in front, avoided"
12382,ARGUMENT.,"the brazen spear; for he stooped forward, and the long javelin was"
12383,ARGUMENT.,"fixed in the ground behind him, and the nether point 538 of the spear"
12384,ARGUMENT.,was shaken; then the rapid weapon spent its force. Thus the javelin of
12385,ARGUMENT.,"Æneas, quivering entered the earth, for it had fled in vain from his"
12386,ARGUMENT.,"strong hand. Then Æneas was enraged in his mind, and said:"
12387,ARGUMENT.,
12388,ARGUMENT.,"“Meriones, quickly indeed, although being a dancer, 539 would my spear"
12389,ARGUMENT.,"have made thee cease for ever, if I had struck thee.”"
12390,ARGUMENT.,
12391,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 537: (return)  It has been well observed that Homer never
12392,ARGUMENT.,"describes a wound as mortal, except when it is inflicted in a part"
12393,ARGUMENT.,really vital.
12394,ARGUMENT.,
12395,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 538: (return)  The οὐρίαχος was the same as the σαυρωτὴρ. See
12396,ARGUMENT.,"Glossæ Herodoteæ, and Hesych. p. 820."
12397,ARGUMENT.,
12398,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 539: (return)  A probable allusion to the Pyrrhic dance, which"
12399,ARGUMENT.,"was in use among the Cretans, from whose country Meriones had come. See"
12400,ARGUMENT.,"the Scholiast, and Müller, Dorians, vol. ii, p. 349."
12401,ARGUMENT.,
12402,ARGUMENT.,"But him then in turn spear-renowned Meriones answered: “Æneas, it were"
12403,ARGUMENT.,"difficult for thee, although being brave, to extinguish the valour of"
12404,ARGUMENT.,"all men, whosoever may come against thee about to repulse thee; for"
12405,ARGUMENT.,"thou too art mortal. And if I, taking aim, should strike thee in the"
12406,ARGUMENT.,"middle with my sharp spear, although being brave, and confiding in thy"
12407,ARGUMENT.,"might, thou wouldst give glory to me, but thy soul to steed-famed"
12408,ARGUMENT.,Pluto.”
12409,ARGUMENT.,
12410,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but him the brave son of Menœtius rebuked: “Meriones,"
12411,ARGUMENT.,"why dost thou, although being brave, harangue thus? O, my friend, the"
12412,ARGUMENT.,Trojans will not retire from the corse by opprobrious words: first will
12413,ARGUMENT.,the earth possess some of them; for the emergency of battle is placed
12414,ARGUMENT.,"in the hands, but of counsel in words; wherefore it is by no means"
12415,ARGUMENT.,"necessary to multiply words, but to fight.”"
12416,ARGUMENT.,
12417,ARGUMENT.,"So saying, he on his part led the way, and along with him the godlike"
12418,ARGUMENT.,hero followed. And as the crash of woodcutting men arises in the dells
12419,ARGUMENT.,"of a mountain, and the sound is heard from afar; so the noise of these,"
12420,ARGUMENT.,"smitten with swords and two-edged spears, arose from the wide-extended"
12421,ARGUMENT.,"plain, from brass, from leather, and from well-prepared bull’s-hide"
12422,ARGUMENT.,"shields. Nor would a man, although very discerning, have recognized"
12423,ARGUMENT.,"noble Sarpedon, since he was totally involved, from his head to the"
12424,ARGUMENT.,"soles of his feet, with weapons, and blood, and dust. But they still"
12425,ARGUMENT.,"crowded round the corse, as when flies in the stall hum around the"
12426,ARGUMENT.,"pails full of milk, during the spring season, when the milk makes moist"
12427,ARGUMENT.,the vessel. So they still crowded round the body: nor did Jove ever
12428,ARGUMENT.,turn his bright eyes from the violent conflict; but he ever beheld
12429,ARGUMENT.,"them, and meditated many evil things in his mind concerning the death"
12430,ARGUMENT.,"of Patroclus, anxiously deliberating whether now illustrious Hector"
12431,ARGUMENT.,"should kill him with his spear in the brave battle, over godlike"
12432,ARGUMENT.,"Sarpedon, and spoil the armour from his shoulders, or whether he should"
12433,ARGUMENT.,"still increase the severe labour to the multitude. To him, thus"
12434,ARGUMENT.,"reflecting, it appeared better that the brave servant of Achilles, the"
12435,ARGUMENT.,"son of Peleus, should repulse the Trojans and brazen-armed Hector,"
12436,ARGUMENT.,"towards the city, and take away the life of many. Into Hector,"
12437,ARGUMENT.,"therefore, first [of all], he sent unwarlike flight, and ascending his"
12438,ARGUMENT.,"chariot, he turned himself to flight, and advised the other Trojans to"
12439,ARGUMENT.,"fly, for he recognized the sacred scales of Jove. 540 Then not even the"
12440,ARGUMENT.,"brave Lycians remained, but were all turned in flight, when they beheld"
12441,ARGUMENT.,"their king wounded to the heart, lying in the heap of dead; for many"
12442,ARGUMENT.,"had fallen over him, whilst the son of Saturn stretched on the violent"
12443,ARGUMENT.,strife. But after they had taken from the shoulders of Sarpedon the
12444,ARGUMENT.,"brazen and glittering armour, the gallant son of Menœtius gave them to"
12445,ARGUMENT.,his companions to carry to the hollow ships; and then cloud-compelling
12446,ARGUMENT.,Jove addressed Apollo:
12447,ARGUMENT.,
12448,ARGUMENT.,"“Come now, dear Phœbus, going, cleanse Sarpedon, [withdrawn] from among"
12449,ARGUMENT.,"the heap of weapons, of sable gore, and afterwards bearing him far"
12450,ARGUMENT.,"away, lave him in the stream of the river, and anoint him with"
12451,ARGUMENT.,"ambrosia, and put around him immortal garments, then give him in charge"
12452,ARGUMENT.,"to the twin-brothers. Sleep and Death, swift conductors, to be borne"
12453,ARGUMENT.,"away, who will quickly place him in the rich state of wide Lycia. There"
12454,ARGUMENT.,will his brethren and kindred perform his obsequies with a tomb and a
12455,ARGUMENT.,"pillar, 541 for this is the honour of the dead.”"
12456,ARGUMENT.,
12457,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 540: (return)  _I.e._ He perceived that the fortune of the
12458,ARGUMENT.,battle was changed by the will of Jove.
12459,ARGUMENT.,
12460,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 541: (return)  _I.e._ A cippus, or column reared upon the"
12461,ARGUMENT.,"tomb. See Pollux, viii. 14, and the Scriptores Rei Agrim. p. 88, ed."
12462,ARGUMENT.,Goes.
12463,ARGUMENT.,
12464,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; nor was Apollo inattentive to his father, but he"
12465,ARGUMENT.,descended from the Idæan mountains to the grievous conflict.
12466,ARGUMENT.,"Immediately removing noble Sarpedon out of [the reach of] weapons, and"
12467,ARGUMENT.,"bearing him far away, he laved him in the stream of the river, anointed"
12468,ARGUMENT.,"him with ambrosia, and placed around him immortal garments, then gave"
12469,ARGUMENT.,"him in charge to the twin-brothers, Sleep and Death, swift conductors,"
12470,ARGUMENT.,to be borne away with them; who accordingly quickly placed him in the
12471,ARGUMENT.,rich state of wide Lycia.
12472,ARGUMENT.,
12473,ARGUMENT.,"In the meantime Patroclus, cheering on his steeds, and Automedon,"
12474,ARGUMENT.,"followed upon the Trojans and Lycians, and came to great"
12475,ARGUMENT.,"harm,—infatuate one!—but if he had observed the direction of the son of"
12476,ARGUMENT.,"Peleus, he had certainly escaped the evil fate of black death. But the"
12477,ARGUMENT.,"counsel of Jove is ever better than that of men, who puts to flight"
12478,ARGUMENT.,"even the valiant man, and easily deprives him of victory, even when he"
12479,ARGUMENT.,himself has impelled him to fight; who then also excited courage in his
12480,ARGUMENT.,"breast. Then whom first, and whom last, didst thou slay, O Patroclus,"
12481,ARGUMENT.,"when the gods now called thee on to death? Adrastus indeed first,"
12482,ARGUMENT.,"Autonous and Echeclus, and Perimus, son of Megas, and Epistor and"
12483,ARGUMENT.,"Melanippus; but then Elasus, and Mulius, and Pylartes. These he slew,"
12484,ARGUMENT.,"but the others were, each of them, mindful of flight. Then indeed had"
12485,ARGUMENT.,"the sons of the Greeks taken lofty-gated Troy, by the hands of"
12486,ARGUMENT.,"Patroclus, for he raged greatly beyond [others] with his spear, had not"
12487,ARGUMENT.,"Phœbus Apollo stood upon a well-built tower, meditating destructive"
12488,ARGUMENT.,"things to him, and assisting the Trojans. Thrice indeed Patroclus"
12489,ARGUMENT.,"mounted a buttress of the lofty wall, and thrice did Apollo repel him"
12490,ARGUMENT.,"with violence, striking his glittering shield with his immortal hands."
12491,ARGUMENT.,"But when now, godlike, he rushed on the fourth time, far-casting"
12492,ARGUMENT.,"Apollo, threatening fearfully, addressed him:"
12493,ARGUMENT.,
12494,ARGUMENT.,"“Retire, thou Jove-sprung Patroclus; by no means is it destined that"
12495,ARGUMENT.,"the city of the magnanimous Trojans should be destroyed by thy spear,"
12496,ARGUMENT.,"nor by Achilles, who is much better than thou.”"
12497,ARGUMENT.,
12498,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke, but Patroclus retired far back, avoiding the wrath of"
12499,ARGUMENT.,far-darting Apollo. But Hector detained his steeds at the Scæan 542
12500,ARGUMENT.,"gates; for he doubted whether, having driven again into the crowd, he"
12501,ARGUMENT.,"should fight, or should loudly command the people to be collected"
12502,ARGUMENT.,"within the walls. To him then, meditating these things, Phœbus Apollo"
12503,ARGUMENT.,"stood near, having assimilated himself to a hero youthful and brave, to"
12504,ARGUMENT.,"Asius, who was the maternal uncle of horse-breaking Hector, own brother"
12505,ARGUMENT.,"of Hecuba, and the son of Dymas, who dwelt in Phrygia, by the streams"
12506,ARGUMENT.,"of the Sangarius: to him Phœbus Apollo, assimilating himself, spoke:"

12508,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 542: (return)  Schneider on Nicander, Ther. 264-9, p. 229,"

12518,ARGUMENT.,
12519,ARGUMENT.,"“Hector, why dost thou cease from battle? Nor does it at all become"
12520,ARGUMENT.,thee. Would that I were so much superior to thee as I am inferior; then
12521,ARGUMENT.,indeed wouldst thou quickly have retired from the battle to thy loss.
12522,ARGUMENT.,"But come, direct thy solid-hoofed steeds against Patroclus, if"
12523,ARGUMENT.,"perchance thou mayest slay him, and Apollo may give thee glory.” So"
12524,ARGUMENT.,"saying, the god on his part went again through the labour of men; but"
12525,ARGUMENT.,illustrious Hector on his part commanded warlike Cebriones to lash on
12526,ARGUMENT.,"his steeds to the battle, whilst Apollo, proceeding, entered the"
12527,ARGUMENT.,throng; and sent an evil tumult among the Greeks; but gave glory to the
12528,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans and Hector. Then indeed did Hector neglect the other Greeks,"
12529,ARGUMENT.,nor slew them; but directed his solid-hoofed horses against Patroclus.
12530,ARGUMENT.,"But Patroclus, on the other side, leaped from his chariot to the"
12531,ARGUMENT.,"ground, in his left hand holding his spear; but in the other he seized"
12532,ARGUMENT.,"a stone, white, rugged, which his hand embraced around. Putting his"
12533,ARGUMENT.,"force to it, he hurled it; nor did it err far from the man, nor was the"
12534,ARGUMENT.,"weapon hurled in vain, 543 for in the forehead with the sharp stone he"
12535,ARGUMENT.,"smote the charioteer of Hector, Cebriones, the illegitimate son of"
12536,ARGUMENT.,"illustrious Priam, whilst holding the reins of the horses. But the"
12537,ARGUMENT.,"stone crushed both his eyebrows, nor did the bone sustain it, and his"
12538,ARGUMENT.,"eyes fell amid the dust upon the ground before his feet. But he then,"
12539,ARGUMENT.,"like unto a diver, fell from the well-formed chariot-seat, and life"
12540,ARGUMENT.,"left his bones. But him insulting, thou didst address, O equestrian"
12541,ARGUMENT.,Patroclus:

12546,ARGUMENT.,“O gods! truly he is a very active man! how nimbly he dives! if indeed
12547,ARGUMENT.,"he were anywhere in the fishy sea, this man, groping for oysters, might"
12548,ARGUMENT.,"have satisfied many, plunging from his ship, although it might be"
12549,ARGUMENT.,stormy; so easily now in the plain does he dive from his chariot!
12550,ARGUMENT.,Without doubt there are divers among the Trojans.”
12551,ARGUMENT.,
12552,ARGUMENT.,"So saying, he advanced against the hero Cebriones, having the force of"
12553,ARGUMENT.,"a lion, which, ravaging the folds, is wounded in the breast, and his"
12554,ARGUMENT.,"own courage destroys him; thus, O Patroclus, ardent, didst thou spring"
12555,ARGUMENT.,"upon Cebriones; whilst Hector, on the other side, leaped from his"
12556,ARGUMENT.,"chariot to the ground. These two, as lions, fought for Cebriones, when"
12557,ARGUMENT.,both being hungry fight with utmost courage for a slaughtered stag in
12558,ARGUMENT.,"mountain tops. So, for Cebriones, these two masters of the fight,"
12559,ARGUMENT.,"Patroclus, son of Menœtius, and illustrious Hector, wished to rend each"
12560,ARGUMENT.,"other’s body with the pitiless brass. Hector indeed, after he seized"
12561,ARGUMENT.,"him by the head, did not let him go; but Patroclus, on the other side,"
12562,ARGUMENT.,held [him by the] foot; and now the rest of the Trojans and Greeks
12563,ARGUMENT.,engaged in the violent conflict.
12564,ARGUMENT.,
12565,ARGUMENT.,"And as the East and South winds strive with each other, in the dells of"
12566,ARGUMENT.,"a mountain, to shake a deep wood, beech, ash, and rugged cornel, but"
12567,ARGUMENT.,they strike their long-extended boughs against each other with an
12568,ARGUMENT.,"immense sound, and a crash of them breaking [arises]; thus the Trojans"
12569,ARGUMENT.,"and Greeks, leaping upon each other, slaughtered, but neither were"
12570,ARGUMENT.,mindful of pernicious flight. And many sharp spears were fixed round
12571,ARGUMENT.,"Cebriones, and winged arrows bounding from the string; and many huge"
12572,ARGUMENT.,"stones smote the shields of those fighting round him; but he, mighty"
12573,ARGUMENT.,"over mighty space, lay in a whirlwind of dust, forgetful of his"
12574,ARGUMENT.,equestrian skill.
12575,ARGUMENT.,
12576,ARGUMENT.,"As long indeed as the sun was ascending the middle heaven, so long did"
12577,ARGUMENT.,"the weapons reach both sides effectually, and the people kept falling."
12578,ARGUMENT.,"But when the sun had passed over towards the west, then indeed the"
12579,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks were superior, contrary to fate. They drew the hero Cebriones"
12580,ARGUMENT.,"from the weapons, out of the tumult of Trojans, and took the armour"
12581,ARGUMENT.,"from his shoulders. But Patroclus, devising evils against the Trojans,"
12582,ARGUMENT.,"rushed on. Thrice then he charged, equal to swift Mars, shouting"
12583,ARGUMENT.,"horridly, and thrice he slew nine heroes. But when, like unto a god, he"
12584,ARGUMENT.,"made the attack for the fourth time, then indeed, O Patroclus, was the"
12585,ARGUMENT.,"end of thy life manifest; for Phœbus, terrible in the dire battle, met"
12586,ARGUMENT.,"thee. He did not indeed perceive him coming through the crowd, for he"
12587,ARGUMENT.,"advanced against him covered with much darkness; but he stood behind,"
12588,ARGUMENT.,"and smote him with his flat hand upon the back and broad shoulders, and"
12589,ARGUMENT.,his eyes were seized with giddiness. 544 And from his head Phœbus
12590,ARGUMENT.,"Apollo struck the helmet, and the oblong helmet rattled, rolling under"
12591,ARGUMENT.,"the horses’ feet, and the crest was defiled with blood and dust;"
12592,ARGUMENT.,"although before this it was not permitted that [this] helmet, crested"
12593,ARGUMENT.,"with horse-hair, should be contaminated by the dust; for it protected"
12594,ARGUMENT.,"the head of a godlike hero, even the venerable forehead of Achilles;"
12595,ARGUMENT.,but Jove then gave it to Hector to wear upon his head; but his
12596,ARGUMENT.,"destruction was near. But the long-shadowed spear, great, sturdy,"
12597,ARGUMENT.,"pointed [with brass], was utterly shattered in his hands; whilst the"
12598,ARGUMENT.,"shield, which reached to his heels, with its belt, fell to the ground;"
12599,ARGUMENT.,"and king Apollo, the son of Jove, unbound his corslet. But stupor"
12600,ARGUMENT.,"seized his brain, and his fair limbs were relaxed under him, and he"
12601,ARGUMENT.,"stood astounded. But a Trojan, hero, Euphorbus, the son of Panthous,"
12602,ARGUMENT.,"who excelled those of his own age in the spear, in horsemanship, and in"
12603,ARGUMENT.,"swiftness of foot, smote him close at hand with his sharp spear, in the"
12604,ARGUMENT.,back between the shoulders. For even before this he had hurled twenty
12605,ARGUMENT.,"men from their horses, at first coming with his chariot, learning [the"
12606,ARGUMENT.,"art] of war. He [it was] who first hurled a weapon at thee, O knight"
12607,ARGUMENT.,"Patroclus, nor did he subdue thee; for he ran back, and was mingled"
12608,ARGUMENT.,"with the crowd, having plucked the ashen spear out of thy body; nor did"
12609,ARGUMENT.,"he await Patroclus, though being unarmed, in the fight. Patroclus,"
12610,ARGUMENT.,"however, subdued by the blow of the god, and by the spear, retired into"
12611,ARGUMENT.,"the crowd of his companions, avoiding death. But Hector, when he"
12612,ARGUMENT.,"perceived magnanimous Patroclus retiring, wounded with a sharp spear,"
12613,ARGUMENT.,"went through the ranks near him, and smote him with his javelin in the"
12614,ARGUMENT.,"lowest part of the groin, and drove the brass quite through. Falling,"
12615,ARGUMENT.,"he gave a crash, and greatly grieved the people of the Greeks. As when"
12616,ARGUMENT.,"a lion presses on an unwearied boar in fight, and they twain, high"
12617,ARGUMENT.,"spirited, contend upon the mountain tops for a small rill, for they"
12618,ARGUMENT.,"both desire to drink, but the lion subdues him by force, panting much;"
12619,ARGUMENT.,"so Hector, the son of Priam, in close fight with his spear, deprived"
12620,ARGUMENT.,"the gallant son of Menœtius of life, having slain many; and, boasting"
12621,ARGUMENT.,"over him, spoke winged words:"

12629,ARGUMENT.,"“Patroclus, doubtless thou didst think to waste our city, and to carry"
12630,ARGUMENT.,"off in thy ships the Trojan women to thy dear father-land, having taken"
12631,ARGUMENT.,"away their day of freedom,—infatuated one! But in defence of these, the"
12632,ARGUMENT.,"fleet steeds of Hector hasten with their feet to war, and I myself, who"
12633,ARGUMENT.,"avert the day of slavery 545 from them, am conspicuous amongst the"
12634,ARGUMENT.,war-loving Trojans in [the use of] the spear. But the vultures shall
12635,ARGUMENT.,"devour thee here. Unhappy man! Nor indeed did Achilles, although being"
12636,ARGUMENT.,"brave, aid thee, who remaining behind, doubtless enjoined many things"
12637,ARGUMENT.,"to thee, going forth: ‘Do not return to me, O equestrian Patroclus, to"
12638,ARGUMENT.,"the hollow barks, before thou rendest the blood-stained garment around"
12639,ARGUMENT.,"the breast of man-slaughtering Hector.’ Thus, doubtless, he addressed"
12640,ARGUMENT.,"thee, and persuaded the mind of foolish thee.”"
12641,ARGUMENT.,
12642,ARGUMENT.,"But him, O knight Patroclus, breathing faintly, thou didst address:"
12643,ARGUMENT.,"“Even now, Hector, vaunt greatly, for Jove, the son of Saturn, and"
12644,ARGUMENT.,"Apollo, have given thee the victory, who subdued me easily; for they"
12645,ARGUMENT.,stripped the armour from my shoulders. But if even twenty such [as
12646,ARGUMENT.,"thou] had opposed me, they had all perished here, subdued by my spear."
12647,ARGUMENT.,"But destructive fate, and the son of Latona, have slain me, and of men,"

12649,ARGUMENT.,"will I tell thee, and do thou ponder it in thy soul. 546 Not long,"
12650,ARGUMENT.,"indeed, shalt thou thyself advance in life, but death and violent fate"

12694,ARGUMENT.,"of Ajax. Being rebuked by Glaucus, he returns, and a fierce contest is"
12695,ARGUMENT.,renewed over the body of Patroclus. The chariot of Achilles is bravely
12696,ARGUMENT.,"defended by Automedon, but the Greeks at last begin to give way, even"

12708,ARGUMENT.,"extended his spear, and his shield on all sides equal, anxious to slay"

12710,ARGUMENT.,"Panthus, of the good ashen spear, neglectful of blameless Patroclus,"
12711,ARGUMENT.,"fallen; but he stood near him, and addressed warlike Menelaus:"
12712,ARGUMENT.,
12713,ARGUMENT.,"“O Menelaus! son of Atreus, Jove-nurtured one, leader of the people,"
12714,ARGUMENT.,"retire, and leave the body, and let alone the bloody spoils; for not"
12715,ARGUMENT.,any of the illustrious Trojans or allies smote Patroclus with the spear

12719,ARGUMENT.,
12720,ARGUMENT.,"But him yellow-haired Menelaus, very indignant, addressed:"

12722,ARGUMENT.,"“Father Jove, certainly it is not fitting to boast inordinately. Not so"
12723,ARGUMENT.,"great is the might of a panther, nor a lion, nor of a destructive wild"
12724,ARGUMENT.,"boar, whose most mighty courage rages in his heart, violently in its"
12725,ARGUMENT.,"strength, as much as the sons of Panthus, of the good ashen spear,"
12726,ARGUMENT.,breathe forth. Nor did the might of horse-breaking Hyperenor enjoy his
12727,ARGUMENT.,"youth, when he reproached me, and withstood me; and said that I was the"
12728,ARGUMENT.,"most reproachful warrior amongst the Greeks; nor did he, I think,"

12730,ARGUMENT.,"Thus certainly will I dissolve thy strength, if thou wilt stand against"
12731,ARGUMENT.,"me. But I advise thee, retiring, to go back into the crowd; nor do thou"
12732,ARGUMENT.,"stand against me, before thou suffer any harm: for it is a fool that"

12744,ARGUMENT.,"brother, whom thou hast slain, and [over whom] thou speakest"
12745,ARGUMENT.,boastingly; and thou hast widowed his wife in the recess of her new

12750,ARGUMENT.,flight be untried or invincible any longer.”
12751,ARGUMENT.,
12752,ARGUMENT.,"So saying, he smote [him] upon the shield equal on all sides, nor did"
12753,ARGUMENT.,"the brass break through, for the point was bent in the stout shield:"
12754,ARGUMENT.,"and Menelaus, the son of Atreus, next made the attack with his brazen"
12755,ARGUMENT.,"spear, having prayed to father Jove. He smote him upon the lowest part"
12756,ARGUMENT.,"of the gullet as he retired, and he himself forcibly impressed [the"
12757,ARGUMENT.,"spear], relying on his strong hand; and the point went quite through"
12758,ARGUMENT.,"his soft neck. And falling, he made a crash, and his armour rang upon"
12759,ARGUMENT.,"him. And his locks, like unto the Graces, were bedewed with blood, and"
12760,ARGUMENT.,"his curls, which were bound with gold and silver. And as a man rears a"
12761,ARGUMENT.,"widely-blooming plant of olive, fair budding, in a solitary place,"
12762,ARGUMENT.,"where water is wont to spring 549 up in abundance, and which the"
12763,ARGUMENT.,"breezes of every wind agitate, and it buds forth with a white flower;"
12764,ARGUMENT.,"but a wind, suddenly coming on with a mighty blast, overturns it from"
12765,ARGUMENT.,"the furrow, and stretches it upon the earth: so the son of Panthus,"
12766,ARGUMENT.,"Euphorbus, skilled in [the use of] the ashen spear, Menelaus, son of"
12767,ARGUMENT.,"Atreus, when he had slain [him], spoiled of his armour. As when any"
12768,ARGUMENT.,"mountain-nurtured lion, relying on his strength, has carried off from"
12769,ARGUMENT.,"the pasturing herd a heifer, which is the best; but first he breaks its"
12770,ARGUMENT.,"neck, seizing it in his strong teeth, and then tearing it in pieces,"
12771,ARGUMENT.,laps up the blood and all the entrails; whilst around him dogs and
12772,ARGUMENT.,"herdsmen shout very frequently from a distance, nor do they wish to go"
12773,ARGUMENT.,"against him, for pale fear violently seizes them: thus the soul of no"
12774,ARGUMENT.,one within his breast dared to advance against glorious Menelaus. Then
12775,ARGUMENT.,indeed the son of Atreus had easily borne off the celebrated arms of
12776,ARGUMENT.,"the son of Panthus, had not Phœbus Apollo envied him, who immediately"
12777,ARGUMENT.,"aroused Hector, equal to fleet Mars, against him, assimilating himself"
12778,ARGUMENT.,"to the hero Mentes, leader of the Cicones; and addressing him, he spoke"
12779,ARGUMENT.,winged words:
12780,ARGUMENT.,
12781,ARGUMENT.,"“Hector, now indeed thou art thus running, pursuing things not to be"
12782,ARGUMENT.,"overtaken, the steeds of warlike Achilles; they indeed are difficult to"
12783,ARGUMENT.,"be managed by mortal men, or to be driven by any other than Achilles,"
12784,ARGUMENT.,"whom an immortal mother bore. In the meanwhile Menelaus, the warlike"
12785,ARGUMENT.,"son of Atreus, protecting Patroclus, has slain the bravest of the"
12786,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans, Euphorbus, the son of Panthus, and made him cease from"

12791,ARGUMENT.,
12792,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having spoken, the god on his part again departed into the labour"
12793,ARGUMENT.,"of the men; but heavy grief oppressed Hector as to his dark soul. Then,"
12794,ARGUMENT.,"indeed, he looked around through the ranks, and immediately observed"
12795,ARGUMENT.,"the one bearing away the famous armour, and the other lying upon the"
12796,ARGUMENT.,ground; and the blood flowed through the inflicted wound. But he
12797,ARGUMENT.,"advanced through the foremost warriors, armed in shining brass, shrilly"
12798,ARGUMENT.,"shouting, like unto the inextinguishable flame of Vulcan. Nor did he"
12799,ARGUMENT.,"escape the notice of the son of Atreus, loudly exclaiming; but he,"
12800,ARGUMENT.,"deeply sighing, thus communed with his own great-hearted soul:"
12801,ARGUMENT.,
12802,ARGUMENT.,"“Ah me! if I leave the beautiful armour and Patroclus, who lies here"
12803,ARGUMENT.,"for the sake of my honour, [I dread] lest some one of the Greeks,"
12804,ARGUMENT.,"whoever perceives it, will be indignant; but if, being alone, I fight"
12805,ARGUMENT.,"with Hector and the Trojans, from shame, [I fear] lest many surround"
12806,ARGUMENT.,"me, [being] alone. But crest-tossing Hector is leading all the Trojans"
12807,ARGUMENT.,hither. But wherefore has my soul been thus debating? Whenever a man
12808,ARGUMENT.,"desires, in opposition to a deity, to fight with a hero whom a god"
12809,ARGUMENT.,"honours, soon is a great destruction hurled upon him; wherefore no one"
12810,ARGUMENT.,"of the Greeks will blame me, who may perceive me retiring from Hector,"
12811,ARGUMENT.,"since he wars under the impulse of a god. But if I could hear Ajax,"
12812,ARGUMENT.,"brave in the din of war, both of us, again returning, would be mindful"
12813,ARGUMENT.,"of battle even against a god, if by any means we could draw off the"
12814,ARGUMENT.,"body for the sake of Achilles, the son of Peleus: of evils, certainly"
12815,ARGUMENT.,it would be the better.” 550

12820,ARGUMENT.,resolved on guarding against by summoning Ajax to his aid; of the last
12821,ARGUMENT.,"two, he prefers the abandonment of the arms, _i.e._ σύλη, spoliation of"
12822,ARGUMENT.,"the corpse, to ἀείκεια, its disfigurement.”—Kennedy."
12823,ARGUMENT.,
12824,ARGUMENT.,"While he was thus deliberating these things in his mind and soul, the"
12825,ARGUMENT.,ranks of the Trojans were meanwhile advancing; and Hector led the way.
12826,ARGUMENT.,"But he retired back, and quitted the corpse, turning round as a"
12827,ARGUMENT.,"shaggy-bearded lion, which dogs and men drive from the stall with"
12828,ARGUMENT.,"spears and clamour; out his valiant heart within his breast is shaken,"
12829,ARGUMENT.,"and he, unwilling, departs from the fold: thus did yellow-haired"
12830,ARGUMENT.,"Menelaus retire from Patroclus. And being turned round, he stood, when"
12831,ARGUMENT.,"he had reached the band of his companions, looking all around for"
12832,ARGUMENT.,"mighty Ajax, the son of Telamon; whom he very quickly perceived upon"
12833,ARGUMENT.,"the left of the whole battle, encouraging his companions, and urging"
12834,ARGUMENT.,them to fight: for Phœbus Apollo had cast a heaven-sent panic amongst
12835,ARGUMENT.,"them. But he made haste to run, and, immediately standing near, spoke:"
12836,ARGUMENT.,
12837,ARGUMENT.,"“Ajax, hither, friend, let us hasten in defence of slain Patroclus, if"
12838,ARGUMENT.,we can bear his naked corse at least to Achilles; for his armour
12839,ARGUMENT.,crest-tossing Hector possesses.”
12840,ARGUMENT.,
12841,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke, but he roused the courage of warlike Ajax, and he"
12842,ARGUMENT.,"advanced through the foremost warriors, and with him yellow-haired"
12843,ARGUMENT.,"Menelaus. Hector on his part, after he had despoiled him of his"
12844,ARGUMENT.,"beautiful armour, was dragging Patroclus, that he might sever the head"
12845,ARGUMENT.,"from the shoulders with the sharp brass, and, carrying off the body,"
12846,ARGUMENT.,"might give it to the Trojan dogs, when Ajax came near, bearing his"
12847,ARGUMENT.,"shield, like a tower. Then Hector, retiring back, retreated into the"
12848,ARGUMENT.,"throng of his companions, and sprung up into his chariot; but he gave"
12849,ARGUMENT.,"the handsome armour to the Trojans to carry to the city, to be a great"
12850,ARGUMENT.,"glory to him. But Ajax, with his broad shield covering around the son"
12851,ARGUMENT.,"of Menœtius, stood like a lion over her young; against which, when"
12852,ARGUMENT.,"leading her whelps, the huntsmen rush together in the wood; whilst he"
12853,ARGUMENT.,"looks dreadful in his might, and draws down all his eyebrows,"
12854,ARGUMENT.,concealing his eyes: so strode Ajax round the hero Patroclus. On the
12855,ARGUMENT.,"other side stood the son of Atreus, warlike Menelaus, augmenting the"
12856,ARGUMENT.,great grief in his bosom.
12857,ARGUMENT.,
12858,ARGUMENT.,"But Glaucus, the son of Hippolochus, leader of the Lycian heroes,"
12859,ARGUMENT.,"looking sternly at Hector, upbraided him with harsh language: “Hector,"
12860,ARGUMENT.,"most excellent as to appearance, certainly thou art greatly deficient"
12861,ARGUMENT.,"in fighting; doubtless good fame possesses thee without reason, since"
12862,ARGUMENT.,"thou art a fugitive. Consider now, how alone with the people [who are]"
12863,ARGUMENT.,"born in Ilium, thou mayest preserve the state and city, for none of the"
12864,ARGUMENT.,"Lycians, at all events, will go to fight with the Greeks for thy city;"
12865,ARGUMENT.,since indeed there is no gratitude for fighting ever incessantly with
12866,ARGUMENT.,"hostile men. How indeed, inglorious one, hast thou preserved an"
12867,ARGUMENT.,"inferior man in the throng, and suffered Sarpedon, at once thy guest"
12868,ARGUMENT.,"and companion, to become a prey and booty to the Greeks; who, when"
12869,ARGUMENT.,"alive, was a great advantage to thy city and thyself; but now thou"
12870,ARGUMENT.,didst not attempt to drive away the dogs from him. Wherefore if any of
12871,ARGUMENT.,"the Lycian warriors will now obey me, go home, 551 and utter"
12872,ARGUMENT.,"destruction will be manifest to Troy. For if now that confident,"
12873,ARGUMENT.,"intrepid strength, was in the Trojans, which enters heroes who in the"
12874,ARGUMENT.,"defence of their country undertake toil, and conflict with hostile men,"
12875,ARGUMENT.,"immediately might we draw Patroclus into Ilium. But if he, lifeless,"
12876,ARGUMENT.,"should come to the great city of king Priam, and we had drawn him away"
12877,ARGUMENT.,"from the battle, quickly indeed would the Greeks ransom [to us] the"
12878,ARGUMENT.,"beautiful armour of Sarpedon, and we might bear himself also into Troy;"
12879,ARGUMENT.,"for the attendant of that man is slain, who is by far the bravest of"
12880,ARGUMENT.,"the Greeks at the ships, and whose servants are close-fighting"
12881,ARGUMENT.,"warriors. But thou, forsooth, hast not dared to stand against"
12882,ARGUMENT.,"magnanimous Ajax, beholding his eyes in the battle of the enemy, nor to"
12883,ARGUMENT.,fight against him; for he is more brave than thou.”

12888,ARGUMENT.,
12889,ARGUMENT.,"But him sternly regarding, crest-tossing Hector addressed: “O Glaucus,"
12890,ARGUMENT.,"why hast thou, being such as thou art, spoken haughtily? I’ faith,"
12891,ARGUMENT.,"friend, I thought that thou didst excel in judgment the others, as many"
12892,ARGUMENT.,"as inhabit fertile Lycia; but now I altogether blame thy understanding,"
12893,ARGUMENT.,"since thou hast thus spoken, thou who sayest that I do not withstand"
12894,ARGUMENT.,"mighty Ajax. Neither have I dreaded the battle, nor the tumult of"
12895,ARGUMENT.,"steeds; but the counsel of ægis-bearing Jove is ever superior, who puts"
12896,ARGUMENT.,"even the valiant man to flight, and easily takes away the victory; but"
12897,ARGUMENT.,"at another time he himself impels him to fight. But come hither, my"
12898,ARGUMENT.,"friend, stand by me, and behold my conduct. Truly I shall always be a"
12899,ARGUMENT.,"coward, as thou sayest, or I will restrain even some of the Greeks,"
12900,ARGUMENT.,"although very eager, from keeping defence over dead Patroclus.”"
12901,ARGUMENT.,
12902,ARGUMENT.,"Thus saying, he cheered on the Trojans, loudly shouting, “Ye Trojans"
12903,ARGUMENT.,"and Lycians, and close-fighting Dardanians, be men, my friends, and be"
12904,ARGUMENT.,"mindful of impetuous valour, whilst I put on the armour of illustrious"
12905,ARGUMENT.,"Achilles, beautiful, of which I despoiled mighty Patroclus, having"
12906,ARGUMENT.,slain him.”
12907,ARGUMENT.,
12908,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having spoken, crest-tossing Hector departed from the glowing"
12909,ARGUMENT.,"battle, and, running very quickly, overtook his companions, not far"
12910,ARGUMENT.,"off, following with swift feet those who were bearing towards the city"
12911,ARGUMENT.,the renowned arms of Achilles. Then standing apart from the mournful
12912,ARGUMENT.,"battle, he changed his armour. His own indeed he gave to the warlike"
12913,ARGUMENT.,Trojans to bear to sacred Ilium; but he put on the immortal arms of
12914,ARGUMENT.,"Achilles, the son of Peleus, which the heavenly gods had bestowed on"
12915,ARGUMENT.,"his dear father; but he indeed, growing old, presented them to his son;"
12916,ARGUMENT.,but the son grew not old in the armour of his father.
12917,ARGUMENT.,
12918,ARGUMENT.,"But when cloud-compelling Jove beheld him apart, accoutred in the"
12919,ARGUMENT.,"armour of divine Pelides, then shaking his head, he said to his own"
12920,ARGUMENT.,soul:
12921,ARGUMENT.,
12922,ARGUMENT.,"“Ah! luckless one; nor is death at all in thy thoughts, which is now"
12923,ARGUMENT.,"near thee; but thou puttest on the immortal armour of the bravest hero,"
12924,ARGUMENT.,"at whom others also tremble; and thou hast slain his companion, both"
12925,ARGUMENT.,"gentle and brave, and thou hast taken the armour from his head and"
12926,ARGUMENT.,shoulders not according to propriety. But now will I give into thy
12927,ARGUMENT.,"hands a great victory, a compensation for this, that Andromache shall"
12928,ARGUMENT.,"never receive from thee, having returned from the battle, the"
12929,ARGUMENT.,illustrious arms of the son of Peleus.”
12930,ARGUMENT.,
12931,ARGUMENT.,"The son of Saturn spoke, and moreover nodded with his sable brows. But"
12932,ARGUMENT.,"the armour fitted the person of Hector, and Mars, the dreadful warrior,"
12933,ARGUMENT.,entered him. And his limbs were inwardly filled with might and
12934,ARGUMENT.,"strength, and he went after the illustrious allies, exclaiming aloud;"
12935,ARGUMENT.,"and glittering in his armour, to all of them he presented the"
12936,ARGUMENT.,"appearance of the magnanimous son of Peleus. But going among them, he"
12937,ARGUMENT.,"animated each with his words,—Mesthles, Glaucus, Medon, and"
12938,ARGUMENT.,"Thersilochus, Asteropæus, Disenor, and Hippothoüs, Phorcys, Chromius,"
12939,ARGUMENT.,"and Ennomus the augur. Exhorting these, he spoke winged words:"
12940,ARGUMENT.,
12941,ARGUMENT.,"“Hear, ye countless troops of allies dwelling around, for I did not"
12942,ARGUMENT.,"assemble you here, each from his own city, seeking or wanting a crowd,"
12943,ARGUMENT.,but that ye might willingly defend for me the wives and infant children
12944,ARGUMENT.,"of the Trojans from the warlike Greeks. Thinking these things, I wear"
12945,ARGUMENT.,"away my people by gifts and provisions [to you], and I satisfy the"
12946,ARGUMENT.,"desire of each of you. Wherefore now let some one, being turned round"
12947,ARGUMENT.,"straight, either perish or be saved; for these are the chances of war."
12948,ARGUMENT.,"552 Nevertheless, whoever will drag Patroclus, although dead, to the"
12949,ARGUMENT.,"horse-breaking Trojans, and to whom Ajax shall yield, [to him] will I"
12950,ARGUMENT.,"present one-half of the spoils, but I myself will keep the other half;"
12951,ARGUMENT.,and glory shall be to him as much as to me.”
12952,ARGUMENT.,
12953,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but they, lifting up their spears, advanced with"
12954,ARGUMENT.,condensed might 553 direct against the Greeks; and their mind eagerly
12955,ARGUMENT.,hoped to draw away the dead body from Telamonian Ajax:—fools! truly
12956,ARGUMENT.,over it he took away the life from many. And then Ajax addressed
12957,ARGUMENT.,"Menelaus, good in the din of war:"

12964,ARGUMENT.,Hesych. p. 766.
12965,ARGUMENT.,
12966,ARGUMENT.,"“O my friend, O Jove-nurtured Menelaus, no longer do I expect that even"
12967,ARGUMENT.,we ourselves will return from battle. Nor do I fear so much about the
12968,ARGUMENT.,"dead body of Patroclus, which will quickly satiate the dogs and birds"
12969,ARGUMENT.,"of the Trojans, as much as I fear for my own head, lest it suffer"
12970,ARGUMENT.,"anything, and for thine, for Hector, that cloud of war, overshadows all"
12971,ARGUMENT.,"things; whilst to us, on the other hand, utter destruction appears. But"
12972,ARGUMENT.,"come, call the bravest of the Greeks, if any one will hear.”"
12973,ARGUMENT.,
12974,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; nor did Menelaus, good in the din of war, disobey; but"
12975,ARGUMENT.,"he shouted, crying with a loud voice to the Greeks:"
12976,ARGUMENT.,
12977,ARGUMENT.,"“Ο friends, leaders and chieftains of the Greeks, ye who with"
12978,ARGUMENT.,"Agamemnon, the son of Atreus, and Menelaus, drink the public wine, 554"
12979,ARGUMENT.,and command each his forces; but honour and glory follows from Jove.
12980,ARGUMENT.,"Difficult would it be for me to look to each of the leaders, for so"
12981,ARGUMENT.,"great a strife of battle burns. But let some one advance, and let him"
12982,ARGUMENT.,"be indignant in his mind, that Patroclus should become a sport to"
12983,ARGUMENT.,Trojan dogs.”

12988,ARGUMENT.,
12989,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but quickly the swift Oïlean Ajax heard, and first"
12990,ARGUMENT.,"advanced opposite, running through the battle; after him Idomeneus, and"
12991,ARGUMENT.,"Meriones, the armour-bearer of Idomeneus, equal to man-slaughtering"
12992,ARGUMENT.,Mars. But who in his mind could recount the names of the others as many
12993,ARGUMENT.,"as afterwards aroused the battle of the Greeks? But the Trojans, in"
12994,ARGUMENT.,"close array, first made the onset, and Hector led them on."
12995,ARGUMENT.,
12996,ARGUMENT.,"But as when, at the mouths 555 of a river flowing from Jove, the great"
12997,ARGUMENT.,"wave roars against the stream, while around the lofty shores resound,"
12998,ARGUMENT.,"the wave being ejected [upon the beach], with so loud a clamour did the"
12999,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans advance: but the Greeks stood round the son of Menœtius, having"
13000,ARGUMENT.,"one spirit, protected by their brazen shields; whilst over their"
13001,ARGUMENT.,shining helmets the son of Saturn poured a thick haze; for he did not
13002,ARGUMENT.,"formerly hate the son of Menœtius when, being alive, he was the"
13003,ARGUMENT.,"attendant of Achilles, therefore he was loth that he should become a"
13004,ARGUMENT.,prey to the Trojan dogs of the enemy; and so he excited his companions
13005,ARGUMENT.,"to defend him. The Trojans, however, first dislodged the dark-eyed"
13006,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks, and they, leaving the dead body, retreated; nor did the"
13007,ARGUMENT.,"magnanimous Trojans slay any of them with their spears, although"
13008,ARGUMENT.,"desirous, but drew off the body. But the Greeks were about to be absent"
13009,ARGUMENT.,"from him a very short while, for very quickly did Ajax rally them, who,"
13010,ARGUMENT.,"next to the renowned son of Peleus, excelled the other Greeks in beauty"
13011,ARGUMENT.,"and in deeds. And he broke through the front ranks, resembling a wild"
13012,ARGUMENT.,"boar in strength, which amongst the mountains easily disperses the dogs"
13013,ARGUMENT.,"and blooming youths through the woods, turning to bay; so the son of"
13014,ARGUMENT.,"illustrious Telamon, noble Ajax, having made the attack, easily routed"
13015,ARGUMENT.,"the phalanxes of the Trojans who had surrounded Patroclus, and mostly"
13016,ARGUMENT.,"expected to drag him to their city, and bear away glory. Meanwhile"
13017,ARGUMENT.,"Hippothous, the illustrious son of Pelasgian Lethus, was dragging him"
13018,ARGUMENT.,"by the foot through the violent conflict, having bound him with a strap"
13019,ARGUMENT.,"at the ancle round the tendons, gratifying Hector and the Trojans. But"
13020,ARGUMENT.,"soon came evil upon him, which no one, even of those desiring it,"
13021,ARGUMENT.,"averted from him. Him the son of Telamon, rushing through the crowd,"
13022,ARGUMENT.,smote in close fight through the brazen-cheeked helmet. The
13023,ARGUMENT.,"horse-haired helmet was cleft by the point of the weapon, stricken by"
13024,ARGUMENT.,"the great spear and strong hand; and the brain, bloody, gushed out of"
13025,ARGUMENT.,the wound at the cone of the helmet; 556 and his strength was there
13026,ARGUMENT.,relaxed. Then he let fall from his hands the foot of magnanimous
13027,ARGUMENT.,"Patroclus, to lie upon the earth, and near him he himself fell, prone"
13028,ARGUMENT.,"upon the dead body, far away from fertile Larissa: nor did he repay the"
13029,ARGUMENT.,"debt of nourishment to his beloved parents, for his life was short,"
13030,ARGUMENT.,subdued by the spear of magnanimous Ajax. But Hector again aimed at
13031,ARGUMENT.,"Ajax with his shining spear; he, however, seeing it opposite, avoided"
13032,ARGUMENT.,"the brazen spear by a little; but he struck Schedius, the magnanimous"
13033,ARGUMENT.,"son of Iphitus, by far the bravest of the Phoceans, who inhabited"
13034,ARGUMENT.,"dwellings in renowned Panopëus, ruling over many men. Him he smote"
13035,ARGUMENT.,"under the middle of the clavicle, and the brazen point of the weapon"
13036,ARGUMENT.,"went quite through, near the extremity of the shoulder. Falling, he"
13037,ARGUMENT.,"made a crash, and his arms rang upon him. Then Ajax again smote warlike"
13038,ARGUMENT.,"Phorcys, the son of Phænops, in the middle of the belly, while"
13039,ARGUMENT.,"defending Hippothous. And he broke the cavity of the corslet, and the"
13040,ARGUMENT.,"brazen weapon drank his entrails through; and falling in the dust, he"
13041,ARGUMENT.,seized the earth with the palm of his hand. The foremost warriors and
13042,ARGUMENT.,"illustrious Hector retreated; but the Greeks shouted loudly, and drew"
13043,ARGUMENT.,"off the bodies, both Phorcys and Hippothous, and they loosed the armour"
13044,ARGUMENT.,from their shoulders.

13059,ARGUMENT.,"body like unto Periphas the herald, son of Epytis, who knowing prudent"
13060,ARGUMENT.,"counsels in his mind, had grown old, as a herald, with his aged sire."
13061,ARGUMENT.,"Assimilating himself to him, Apollo, the son of Jove, addressed him:"
13062,ARGUMENT.,
13063,ARGUMENT.,"“O Æneas, how could ye preserve lofty Ilium against the deity, since I"
13064,ARGUMENT.,"behold these other men relying on their bravery, and might, and valour,"

13066,ARGUMENT.,"victory to us, rather than to the Danai; yet ye greatly tremble, nor"
13067,ARGUMENT.,fight.”
13068,ARGUMENT.,
13069,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but Æneas, seeing him before him, recognized far-darting"
13070,ARGUMENT.,"Apollo; and loudly shouting, addressed Hector:"
13071,ARGUMENT.,
13072,ARGUMENT.,"“O Hector, and ye other leaders of the Trojans and allies, this now"
13073,ARGUMENT.,"indeed is a shame, that we, subdued by cowardice, should go up to"
13074,ARGUMENT.,"Ilium, [driven] by the warlike Achæans. For already even now some one"
13075,ARGUMENT.,"of the gods, having stood near to me, declared that Jove, the highest"
13076,ARGUMENT.,"counsellor, is an ally of the battle [to us]. Wherefore let us go"
13077,ARGUMENT.,"direct against the Greeks, nor let them quietly move the dead Patroclus"
13078,ARGUMENT.,to the ships.”
13079,ARGUMENT.,
13080,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke, and then springing forth, stood far before the front"
13081,ARGUMENT.,"ranks. But they rallied, and stood opposed to the Greeks. Then Æneas"
13082,ARGUMENT.,"wounded with his spear Leocritus, son of Arisbas, the brave companion"
13083,ARGUMENT.,"of Lycomedes. Him falling, warlike Lycomedes pitied, and advancing very"
13084,ARGUMENT.,"near, he stood, and hurled with his shining spear, and struck Apisaon,"
13085,ARGUMENT.,"the son of Hippasis, shepherd of the people, in the liver, beneath the"
13086,ARGUMENT.,"diaphragm, and immediately relaxed his limbs. He had come from fertile"
13087,ARGUMENT.,"Pæonia, and next to Asteropæus, was the bravest to fight. Warlike"
13088,ARGUMENT.,"Asteropæus pitied him-fallen, and he rushed forward, willing to fight"
13089,ARGUMENT.,"with the Greeks. But not yet could he [do so], for [those] standing"
13090,ARGUMENT.,"around Patroclus were fenced in on every side with shields, and held"
13091,ARGUMENT.,"their spears before them; for Ajax went eagerly among all, greatly"
13092,ARGUMENT.,cheering them on. He suffered not any one either to retire from the
13093,ARGUMENT.,"body, nor any of the Greeks to fight in front, excelling the others,"
13094,ARGUMENT.,"but vigorously to stalk around for defence, and to combat in close"
13095,ARGUMENT.,fight. Thus did mighty Ajax command; but the earth was moistened with
13096,ARGUMENT.,"purple gore, whilst upon each other fell the dead bodies of the Trojans"
13097,ARGUMENT.,"and courageous allies, and of the Greeks; for neither did they fight"
13098,ARGUMENT.,"bloodlessly, although far fewer perished, because they were ever"
13099,ARGUMENT.,mindful throughout the tumult to repel severe labour from each other.
13100,ARGUMENT.,
13101,ARGUMENT.,"Thus indeed they fought, like a fire; nor would you say that the Sun"
13102,ARGUMENT.,"was safe, or the Moon, for they were wrapt in dark haze in the combat,"
13103,ARGUMENT.,as many of the bravest as stood around the dead son of Menœtius. The
13104,ARGUMENT.,"other Trojans and well-armed Greeks, however, fought at ease 557"
13105,ARGUMENT.,beneath the atmosphere; the piercing splendour of the sun was expanded
13106,ARGUMENT.,"over them, and a cloud did not appear over all the earth, nor the"
13107,ARGUMENT.,"mountains. Resting at intervals, they fought, avoiding the cruel"
13108,ARGUMENT.,"weapons of each other, standing far asunder; whilst those in the middle"
13109,ARGUMENT.,"suffered hardships from darkness and from war, and were afflicted by"
13110,ARGUMENT.,"the ruthless brass, as many as were most brave. But two heroes,"
13111,ARGUMENT.,"illustrious men, Thrasymedes and Antilochus, had not yet heard that"
13112,ARGUMENT.,"blameless Patroclus was dead; but thought that, still alive, he was"
13113,ARGUMENT.,"fighting with the Trojans in the foremost tumult. But these, watching"
13114,ARGUMENT.,"the slaughter and flight of their companions, fought apart, since"
13115,ARGUMENT.,"Nestor had so ordered, urging [them] on to battle from the black ships."
13116,ARGUMENT.,"But to these all day a mighty contest of severe strife arose, and ever"
13117,ARGUMENT.,"incessantly the knees, the legs, and the feet of each under him, the"
13118,ARGUMENT.,hands and the eyes of those fighting around the brave companion of
13119,ARGUMENT.,"swift-footed Æacides, were defiled with fatigue and perspiration. And"
13120,ARGUMENT.,"as when a man gives the hide of a huge ox, saturated with grease, to"
13121,ARGUMENT.,"his people to stretch, but they, having received, stretch it, standing"
13122,ARGUMENT.,"apart from each other in a circle, and straightway the moisture exudes,"
13123,ARGUMENT.,"and the oily matter enters, many pulling it, till it is stretched in"
13124,ARGUMENT.,"every direction; so they, on both sides, dragged the body here and"
13125,ARGUMENT.,"there in a small space; for the mind of the Trojans, on the one hand,"
13126,ARGUMENT.,"eagerly hoped to draw him to Ilium, but of the Greeks, on the other, to"
13127,ARGUMENT.,"the hollow ships. Around him arose a fierce tumult; nor could Mars, the"
13128,ARGUMENT.,"exciter of troops, nor Minerva, having beheld it, have found fault, not"
13129,ARGUMENT.,even if wrath had particularly come upon her; such an evil labour of
13130,ARGUMENT.,men and horses did Jove extend over Patroclus on that day. Nor as yet
13131,ARGUMENT.,"did noble Achilles at all know that Patroclus was dead, because they"
13132,ARGUMENT.,"fought far from the swift ships, beneath the wall of the Trojans. He"
13133,ARGUMENT.,"never thought in his mind that he was dead; but that alive, having"
13134,ARGUMENT.,"approached the gates, he would return back, since he did not at all"
13135,ARGUMENT.,"suppose that he could sack the city without him, for he had often heard"
13136,ARGUMENT.,"this from his mother, hearing it apart, who used to tell him the design"
13137,ARGUMENT.,of mighty Jove. Yet his mother had not then told him so great an evil
13138,ARGUMENT.,"as had happened, that the companion by far most dear to him had"
13139,ARGUMENT.,perished.

13145,ARGUMENT.,"charged incessantly, and slaughtered one another, and thus would some"
13146,ARGUMENT.,of the brazen-mailed Greeks say:
13147,ARGUMENT.,
13148,ARGUMENT.,"“O friends, surely it will not be honourable for us to retreat to the"
13149,ARGUMENT.,hollow ships; but [rather] let the black earth here gape for all. This
13150,ARGUMENT.,"indeed would at once be better for us, than that we should permit the"
13151,ARGUMENT.,"horse-breaking Trojans to drag him to their city, and obtain glory.”"
13152,ARGUMENT.,
13153,ARGUMENT.,And thus also would some one of the magnanimous Trojans say:
13154,ARGUMENT.,
13155,ARGUMENT.,"“Ο friends, although it be our destiny that all be equally subdued"
13156,ARGUMENT.,"beside this man, never let any one retire from the battle.”"
13157,ARGUMENT.,
13158,ARGUMENT.,"Thus, then, some one said, and aroused the spirit of each. Thus indeed"
13159,ARGUMENT.,were they fighting; and the iron clangour 558 reached the brazen heaven
13160,ARGUMENT.,through the unfruitful air. But the horses of Æacides being apart from
13161,ARGUMENT.,"the combat, wept, when first they perceived that their charioteer had"
13162,ARGUMENT.,"fallen in the dust, beneath man-slaughtering Hector. Automedon, indeed,"
13163,ARGUMENT.,"the brave son of Diores, frequently urged them on, beating them with"
13164,ARGUMENT.,"the sharp lash, and frequently addressed them in mild terms and in"
13165,ARGUMENT.,threats; but they chose neither to go back to the ships towards the
13166,ARGUMENT.,"wide Hellespont nor into the battle among the Greeks; but, as a pillar"
13167,ARGUMENT.,"remains firm, which stands at the tomb of a dead man or woman, so they"
13168,ARGUMENT.,"remained detaining the splendid chariot motionless, and drooping their"
13169,ARGUMENT.,heads to the earth. But warm tears 559 flowed from their eyelids to the
13170,ARGUMENT.,"earth, complaining from desire of their charioteer; and their thick"
13171,ARGUMENT.,"mane was defiled, flowing down on both sides from the collar at the"

13239,ARGUMENT.,
13240,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke, but Alcimedon, ascending the chariot, swift in war,"
13241,ARGUMENT.,"instantly took in his hands the lash and reins, whilst Automedon leaped"
13242,ARGUMENT.,"down; but illustrious Hector perceived this, and immediately addressed"
13243,ARGUMENT.,"Æneas, being near:"
13244,ARGUMENT.,
13245,ARGUMENT.,"“Æneas, counsellor of the brazen-mailed Trojans, I have observed these"
13246,ARGUMENT.,two steeds of Achilles proceeding through the battle with unskilful

13248,ARGUMENT.,"desire it in thy mind; for standing opposite, they will not dare to"
13249,ARGUMENT.,"withstand us, rushing on to fight in battle.”"
13250,ARGUMENT.,
13251,ARGUMENT.,Thus he spoke; nor did the brave son of Anchises disobey. Both advanced
13252,ARGUMENT.,"direct, covered as to their shoulders with bulls’ hides, dry, thick;"
13253,ARGUMENT.,and upon them much brass was plated. But along with them went both
13254,ARGUMENT.,Chromius and god-like Aretus: and their mind greatly hoped to slay
13255,ARGUMENT.,"them, and to drive away the long-necked steeds. Foolish, 564 for they"
13256,ARGUMENT.,"were not destined to return back bloodlessly from Automedon, for he,"
13257,ARGUMENT.,"having prayed to father Jove, was filled with fortitude and valour, as"
13258,ARGUMENT.,"to his dark mind, and immediately addressed Alcimedon, his faithful"
13259,ARGUMENT.,comrade:
13260,ARGUMENT.,
13261,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 564: (return)  Cf. Æn. x. 501, sqq. So Milton, P.L. ix. 404:—"

13265,ARGUMENT.,
13266,ARGUMENT.,
13267,ARGUMENT.,"“O Alcimedon, do not now detain the steeds far from me; but [keep them]"
13268,ARGUMENT.,"breathing closely at my back; for I do not think that Hector, the son"
13269,ARGUMENT.,"of Priam, will abstain from violence, before that he has mounted the"
13270,ARGUMENT.,"beautiful-maned horses of Achilles, having slain both of us, and put to"
13271,ARGUMENT.,rout the ranks of Grecian heroes; or himself be slain among the first.”
13272,ARGUMENT.,
13273,ARGUMENT.,"Thus saying, he called upon the Ajaces, and Menelaus: “Ye Ajaces,"
13274,ARGUMENT.,"leaders of the Greeks, and Menelaus, leave then the dead body to those,"
13275,ARGUMENT.,"as many as are bravest, to defend it on all sides, and to repulse the"
13276,ARGUMENT.,ranks of men; but from us who are alive avert the merciless day. For
13277,ARGUMENT.,"hither violently rush through the lamentable fight Hector and Æneas,"
13278,ARGUMENT.,who are the best of the Trojans. But all these things rest upon the
13279,ARGUMENT.,"knees of the gods; for I also will hurl, and all these things will be a"
13280,ARGUMENT.,care to Jove.”
13281,ARGUMENT.,
13282,ARGUMENT.,"He said; and, brandishing, hurled his long-shadowed spear, and struck"
13283,ARGUMENT.,"upon the shield of Aretus, equal on all sides; it however did not repel"
13284,ARGUMENT.,"the spear, but the brass went entirely through, and passed through the"
13285,ARGUMENT.,belt into the bottom of his belly. And as when a man in youthful
13286,ARGUMENT.,"vigour, holding a sharp axe, cuts through the whole tendon, striking"
13287,ARGUMENT.,"behind the horns of a wild bull; but it, leaping forward, falls; so he,"
13288,ARGUMENT.,"springing forward, fell supine; and the sharp spear, quivering in his"
13289,ARGUMENT.,"entrails, relaxed his limbs. Then Hector took aim at Automedon with his"
13290,ARGUMENT.,"shining spear, but he, seeing it in front of him, avoided the brazen"
13291,ARGUMENT.,weapon; for he bent forward. But the long spear was fixed in the ground
13292,ARGUMENT.,behind him; and moreover the nether end of the spear was shaken; but
13293,ARGUMENT.,there then the strong weapon spent its force. Then truly they would
13294,ARGUMENT.,"have engaged hand to hand with their swords, had not the eager Ajaces,"
13295,ARGUMENT.,"who came through the crowd, at the call of their companion, separated"
13296,ARGUMENT.,"them. But Hector, Æneas, and godlike Chromius, greatly dreading them,"
13297,ARGUMENT.,"retired back again, and left Aretus lying there, lacerated as to his"
13298,ARGUMENT.,"heart; but him Automedon, equal to swift Mars, despoiled of his armour,"
13299,ARGUMENT.,"and, boasting, uttered this speech:"
13300,ARGUMENT.,
13301,ARGUMENT.,“Surely now I have a little relieved my heart of sorrow for the dead
13302,ARGUMENT.,"son of Menœtius, although having slain but an inferior man.”"
13303,ARGUMENT.,
13304,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having spoken, seizing the gore-stained spoils, he placed them in"
13305,ARGUMENT.,"the chariot, and mounted himself, bloody as to his feet and hands"
13306,ARGUMENT.,"above, like some lion which has fed upon a bull. Again over Patroclus"
13307,ARGUMENT.,"was the direful battle extended, grievous, lamentable; and Minerva"
13308,ARGUMENT.,"excited the contention, descending from heaven; for far-sounding Jove"
13309,ARGUMENT.,"sent her forth to encourage the Greeks, as his intention was now"
13310,ARGUMENT.,"changed. As Jove extends a purple rainbow from heaven to mortals, to be"
13311,ARGUMENT.,"a signal either of war, or of a chilling storm, which causes men to"
13312,ARGUMENT.,"cease from their works upon the earth, and afflicts the cattle; so she,"
13313,ARGUMENT.,"having obscured herself in a purple cloud, entered the army of the"
13314,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks, and aroused every man. First, however, she addressed the son of"
13315,ARGUMENT.,"Atreus, gallant Menelaus, inciting him, for he was near her,"
13316,ARGUMENT.,"assimilating herself, in her form and unwearied voice, to Phœnix:"
13317,ARGUMENT.,
13318,ARGUMENT.,"“Thine, of a truth, will shame and disgrace now be, O Menelaus, if the"
13319,ARGUMENT.,swift dogs tear the faithful companion of illustrious Achilles beneath
13320,ARGUMENT.,"the wall of the Trojans; therefore bravely hold on, and urge on all the"
13321,ARGUMENT.,"people.” Whom, in return, Menelaus, good in the din of war, addressed:"
13322,ARGUMENT.,"“Phœnix, father, old man long since born, would that Minerva would give"
13323,ARGUMENT.,"me strength, and ward off the force of the weapons. Then indeed would I"
13324,ARGUMENT.,"be willing to stand by and defend Patroclus; for dying, he greatly"
13325,ARGUMENT.,"affected my mind with grief. But Hector has the dreadful force of fire,"
13326,ARGUMENT.,nor does he cease slaying with his spear; for to him Jove affords
13327,ARGUMENT.,glory.”
13328,ARGUMENT.,
13329,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but the azure-eyed goddess Minerva rejoiced, because to"
13330,ARGUMENT.,her he had prayed first of all the gods. But in his shoulders and knees
13331,ARGUMENT.,"she put strength, and placed in his bosom the boldness of a fly, which,"
13332,ARGUMENT.,"although frequently driven away from a human body, persists in"
13333,ARGUMENT.,"biting,—and the blood of man is sweet to it. With such confidence she"
13334,ARGUMENT.,"filled his dark soul: and he advanced towards Patroclus, and took aim"
13335,ARGUMENT.,"with his splendid spear. Now there was among the Trojans one Podes, the"
13336,ARGUMENT.,"son of Eëtion, rich and brave; whom of his people Hector chiefly"
13337,ARGUMENT.,"honoured, for he was his dear companion in the banquet. Him"
13338,ARGUMENT.,"yellow-haired Menelaus smote upon the belt while hastening to flight,"
13339,ARGUMENT.,"and drove the brazen weapon quite through. He, falling, gave a crash,"
13340,ARGUMENT.,"and Menelaus, the son of Atreus, dragged away the body from the Trojans"
13341,ARGUMENT.,"to the crowd of his companions. But Apollo, standing near, excited"
13342,ARGUMENT.,"Hector in the likeness of Phœnops, son of Asias, who, inhabiting"
13343,ARGUMENT.,"dwellings at Abydos, was most dear to him of all his guests."
13344,ARGUMENT.,"Assimilating himself to him, far-darting Apollo spoke:"
13345,ARGUMENT.,
13346,ARGUMENT.,"“Hector, what other of the Greeks will any more fear thee, since now"
13347,ARGUMENT.,"thou dreadest Menelaus, who indeed before was but an effeminate"
13348,ARGUMENT.,"warrior, but now departs done, bearing off the dead corse from the"
13349,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans? He has slain, in the front ranks, Podes, the son of Eëtion,"
13350,ARGUMENT.,"thy comrade, faithful and brave.”"
13351,ARGUMENT.,
13352,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but him a dark cloud of grief overshadowed, and he went"
13353,ARGUMENT.,"through the front ranks, armed in glittering brass. And then the son of"
13354,ARGUMENT.,"Saturn took his ægis, fringed and splendid, and covered Ida with"
13355,ARGUMENT.,"clouds; but having flashed his lightning, he thundered very loudly, and"
13356,ARGUMENT.,"shook it (the mountain); and (he) gave victory to the Trojans, but put"
13357,ARGUMENT.,the Greeks to flight.
13358,ARGUMENT.,
13359,ARGUMENT.,"Peneleus, the Bœotian, first was leader of the flight; for he was"
13360,ARGUMENT.,"wounded slightly 565 on the tip of the shoulder with a spear, being"
13361,ARGUMENT.,always turned frontwards; but the spear of Polydamas grazed even to the
13362,ARGUMENT.,"bone, for he, coming close, had wounded him. Next Hector wounded"
13363,ARGUMENT.,"Leïtus, son of magnanimous Alectryon, on the hand at the wrist, and"
13364,ARGUMENT.,"caused him to cease from battle. Then looking around him, he trembled,"
13365,ARGUMENT.,since he no longer hoped in his mind [to be able] to fight with the
13366,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans, holding his spear in his hand. But Idomeneus had struck, on"
13367,ARGUMENT.,"the corslet, upon the breast near the pap, Hector rushing after Leïtus:"
13368,ARGUMENT.,"the long spear, however, was broken at the socket; and the Trojans"
13369,ARGUMENT.,"shouted. But he [Hector] discharged his javelin at Idomeneus, the son"
13370,ARGUMENT.,"of Deucalion, as he was standing in his car: him he missed by a little,"
13371,ARGUMENT.,"but struck Coeranus, the attendant and charioteer of Meriones, who had"
13372,ARGUMENT.,"followed him from well-situated Lyctus. For at first on foot, having"
13373,ARGUMENT.,"left his equally-plied ships, he came, and would have secured a decided"
13374,ARGUMENT.,"victory to the Trojans, had not Coeranus quickly driven on his"
13375,ARGUMENT.,"swift-footed steeds: to him then he (Coeranus) came as a help, and"
13376,ARGUMENT.,warded off the merciless day; but he himself lost his life beneath
13377,ARGUMENT.,"man-slaughtering Hector. Him he smote beneath the jaw-bone and ear, and"
13378,ARGUMENT.,the extremity of the spear forced out his teeth and cut through the
13379,ARGUMENT.,"middle of his tongue. He fell from his chariot, and the reins dropped"
13380,ARGUMENT.,"to the ground; and Meriones, stooping, lifted them from the plain in"
13381,ARGUMENT.,"his own hands, and addressed Idomeneus:"
13382,ARGUMENT.,
13383,ARGUMENT.,"“Lash on, now, until thou reach the swift ships; for even thou thyself"
13384,ARGUMENT.,perceivest that victory is no longer on the side of the Achæans.”

13388,ARGUMENT.,
13389,ARGUMENT.,Thus he spake; and Idomeneus lashed on the beautiful-maned steeds to
13390,ARGUMENT.,the hollow ships; for fear now seized his mind.
13391,ARGUMENT.,
13392,ARGUMENT.,"Nor did Jove escape notice of magnanimous Ajax and Menelaus, when he"
13393,ARGUMENT.,for the present gave the dubious victory to the Trojans; but to them
13394,ARGUMENT.,"the mighty Ajax, son of Telamon, began to speak:"
13395,ARGUMENT.,
13396,ARGUMENT.,“Alas! even he who is very stupid might now know that father Jove
13397,ARGUMENT.,"himself is aiding the Trojans; for the weapons of them all take effect,"
13398,ARGUMENT.,"whoever may throw them, whether coward or brave man. Jove certainly"
13399,ARGUMENT.,directs them all. But the weapons of all of us fall to the earth in
13400,ARGUMENT.,"vain. Come, however, let us devise the best plan, both how we may drag"
13401,ARGUMENT.,"off the corse, and how we ourselves may be a source of joy to our"
13402,ARGUMENT.,"beloved comrades, having returned home. They, of a truth, beholding us"
13403,ARGUMENT.,"here, are grieved, and think that we shall no longer resist the might"
13404,ARGUMENT.,"and invincible hands of man-slaughtering Hector. But, would there were"
13405,ARGUMENT.,"some companion who would quickly bring word to Achilles, since I think"
13406,ARGUMENT.,"he has not yet heard the mournful tidings, that his dear comrade has"
13407,ARGUMENT.,"died. But nowhere can I see such a person among the Greeks, for they"
13408,ARGUMENT.,"and their steeds are together enveloped in darkness. O father Jove,"
13409,ARGUMENT.,liberate at least the sons of the Greeks from darkness; make a clear
13410,ARGUMENT.,"atmosphere, and grant us to see with our eyes; then destroy us in the"
13411,ARGUMENT.,"light, 566 if thus it be pleasing to thee.”"

13419,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but the Sire felt compassion for him weeping, and"
13420,ARGUMENT.,"immediately dissipated the haze, and removed the cloud. And the sun"
13421,ARGUMENT.,"shone forth, and the whole battle was displayed, and then Ajax"
13422,ARGUMENT.,"addressed Menelaus, good in the din of war:"
13423,ARGUMENT.,
13424,ARGUMENT.,"“Look around now, O Jove-nurtured Menelaus, if anywhere thou canst"
13425,ARGUMENT.,"perceive, yet alive, Antilochus, the son of magnanimous Nestor. Urge"
13426,ARGUMENT.,"him, going speedily, to tell to warlike Achilles, that the comrade, by"
13427,ARGUMENT.,"far most dear to him, has perished.”"
13428,ARGUMENT.,
13429,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; nor did Menelaus, good in the din of war, disobey. But"
13430,ARGUMENT.,"he hastened to go, like some lion from a fold, which after that he is"
13431,ARGUMENT.,"fatigued, harassing both dogs and men, who watching all night, suffer"
13432,ARGUMENT.,"him not to carry off the fat of the oxen; but he, desirous of flesh,"
13433,ARGUMENT.,"rushes on, but nothing profits; for many javelins fly against him from"
13434,ARGUMENT.,"daring hands, and blazing torches, which, eager as he is, he dreads;"
13435,ARGUMENT.,"but early in the morning he goes apart with saddened mind. So, most"
13436,ARGUMENT.,"unwilling, from Patroclus went Menelaus, brave in the din of war;"
13437,ARGUMENT.,"because he greatly feared lest the Greeks, through grievous terror,"
13438,ARGUMENT.,"should leave him a prey to the enemy. And much, therefore, he exhorted"
13439,ARGUMENT.,Meriones and the Ajaces:
13440,ARGUMENT.,
13441,ARGUMENT.,"“Ye Ajaces, leaders of the Greeks, and Meriones, now let each one be"
13442,ARGUMENT.,"mindful of the gentleness of wretched Patroclus; for when alive, he"
13443,ARGUMENT.,"knew how to be mild to all; but now, indeed, Death and Fate overtake"
13444,ARGUMENT.,him.”
13445,ARGUMENT.,
13446,ARGUMENT.,"Thus then having spoken, yellow-haired Menelaus departed, gazing round"
13447,ARGUMENT.,"in all directions, like an eagle, which, they say, sees most acutely of"
13448,ARGUMENT.,"birds beneath the sky, and which, though being aloft, the swift-footed"
13449,ARGUMENT.,"hare does not escape, when lying beneath the dense-foliaged thicket;"
13450,ARGUMENT.,"but he pounces upon it, and quickly seizing it, deprives it of life."
13451,ARGUMENT.,"Thus, O Jove-nurtured Menelaus, were thy shining eyes turned round in"
13452,ARGUMENT.,"all directions through the band of thy numerous companions, if anywhere"
13453,ARGUMENT.,"thou mightst behold the son of Nestor, yet living. But him he very soon"
13454,ARGUMENT.,"perceived upon the left of all the battle, encouraging his companions,"
13455,ARGUMENT.,"and inciting them to fight; and standing near, yellow-haired Menelaus"
13456,ARGUMENT.,addressed [him]:
13457,ARGUMENT.,
13458,ARGUMENT.,"“Ho! hither come, Antilochus, Jove-nurtured, that thou mayest hear the"
13459,ARGUMENT.,"sad message which—would that it had not happened. I think, indeed, that"
13460,ARGUMENT.,"thou thyself looking, perceivest that a god rolls disaster upon the"
13461,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks, but that victory is on the side of the Trojans; for Patroclus,"
13462,ARGUMENT.,"the bravest of the Greeks, is slain; and a great longing [after him]"
13463,ARGUMENT.,"has befallen the Greeks. But do thou quickly tell it to Achilles,"
13464,ARGUMENT.,"running to the ships of the Greeks, if perchance quickly he may bring"
13465,ARGUMENT.,in safety to his ships the unarmed body; for crest-tossing Hector
13466,ARGUMENT.,possesses the armour.”
13467,ARGUMENT.,
13468,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but Antilochus shuddered, hearing the news; and long did"
13469,ARGUMENT.,"a want of words possess him; and his eyes were filled with tears, and"
13470,ARGUMENT.,his liquid voice was interrupted. Yet not even thus did he neglect the
13471,ARGUMENT.,"command of Menelaus; but he hastened to run, and gave his armour to"
13472,ARGUMENT.,"Laodocus, his blameless companion, who, near him, managed the"
13473,ARGUMENT.,"solid-hoofed steeds. Him, however, his feet bore, weeping, from the"
13474,ARGUMENT.,"battle, about to communicate the evil news to Achilles, son of Peleus."
13475,ARGUMENT.,
13476,ARGUMENT.,"Nor, O Jove-nurtured Menelaus, was thy mind willing to aid the harassed"
13477,ARGUMENT.,"comrades, in the place whence Antilochus had departed, and great"
13478,ARGUMENT.,longing after him was caused to the Pylians; but to them he sent noble
13479,ARGUMENT.,"Thrasymedes, and he himself went again towards the hero Patroclus; but"
13480,ARGUMENT.,"arriving, he stood beside the Ajaces, and immediately addressed them:"
13481,ARGUMENT.,
13482,ARGUMENT.,"“Him, indeed, I have now despatched to the swift ships, to go to"
13483,ARGUMENT.,"swift-footed Achilles: yet I do not think that he will come, although"
13484,ARGUMENT.,"greatly enraged with noble Hector; for being unarmed, he could by no"
13485,ARGUMENT.,means fight with the Trojans. Let even us then ourselves deliberate
13486,ARGUMENT.,"upon the best plan, as well how we shall draw off the body, as also how"
13487,ARGUMENT.,we ourselves may escape Death and Fate from the clamour of the
13488,ARGUMENT.,Trojans.”
13489,ARGUMENT.,
13490,ARGUMENT.,But him mighty Telamonian Ajax then answered:
13491,ARGUMENT.,
13492,ARGUMENT.,"“All things correctly hast thou spoken, O illustrious Menelaus. But do"
13493,ARGUMENT.,"thou, and Meriones, stooping quickly under it, having lifted it up,"

13498,ARGUMENT.,
13499,ARGUMENT.,Thus he spoke; but they with great exertion lifted up the body in their
13500,ARGUMENT.,arms from the ground: but the Trojan army shouted in their rear when
13501,ARGUMENT.,"they saw the Greeks raising up the dead body, and rushed on like dogs,"
13502,ARGUMENT.,"which spring upon a wounded boar, before the youthful hunters. One"
13503,ARGUMENT.,"while indeed they run, eager to tear him asunder, but again, when he"
13504,ARGUMENT.,"turns upon them, relying on his strength, then they retreat, and fly in"
13505,ARGUMENT.,different directions hither and thither: so the Trojans sometimes
13506,ARGUMENT.,"steadily pursued in a body, striking with their swords and two-edged"
13507,ARGUMENT.,"spears; but when again the Ajaces, turning round upon them, stood, then"
13508,ARGUMENT.,"was their colour changed, nor dared any one, rushing forward, to combat"
13509,ARGUMENT.,for the corpse.
13510,ARGUMENT.,
13511,ARGUMENT.,Thus they with alacrity bore the body from the fight towards the hollow
13512,ARGUMENT.,"ships; but the fierce battle was extended to them like a flame, which"
13513,ARGUMENT.,"assailing, [and] being suddenly excited, sets fire to a city of men,"
13514,ARGUMENT.,and the houses diminish in the mighty blaze; whilst the force of the
13515,ARGUMENT.,wind roars through it: so a horrid tumult of steeds and warlike heroes
13516,ARGUMENT.,"followed them departing. But as mules, exerting vast strength, 567 drag"
13517,ARGUMENT.,from a mountain along a rugged path either a beam or a large piece of
13518,ARGUMENT.,"timber for ship-building, but the spirit within them, as they hasten,"
13519,ARGUMENT.,is wearied equally with fatigue and perspiration; so they with alacrity
13520,ARGUMENT.,"bore away the body, whilst the Ajaces behind them checked [the enemy];"
13521,ARGUMENT.,"as a barrier of wood, stretched straight across a plain, restrains"
13522,ARGUMENT.,"water; which checks the furious courses even of rapid rivers, and"
13523,ARGUMENT.,"immediately turning them, directs the streams of all into the plain;"
13524,ARGUMENT.,"nor can they at all burst through it, though flowing with violence. So"
13525,ARGUMENT.,"the Ajaces in the rear always repulsed the attack of the Trojans, who,"
13526,ARGUMENT.,"however, followed along with them; but two amongst them in particular,"
13527,ARGUMENT.,"Æneas, son of Anchises, and illustrious Hector. And as a cloud of"
13528,ARGUMENT.,"starlings or jackdaws, shrilly chattering, 568 flies away when they"
13529,ARGUMENT.,"perceive a hawk advancing, which brings death to small birds; so then"
13530,ARGUMENT.,"from Æneas and Hector departed the sons of the Greeks, loudly"
13531,ARGUMENT.,"clamouring, and were forgetful of the fight. And much beautiful armour"
13532,ARGUMENT.,of the flying Greeks fell both in and about the trench; but there was
13533,ARGUMENT.,no cessation from the battle.

13588,ARGUMENT.,"rich 570 tunic. But he, mighty, lay extended at great length in the"

13688,ARGUMENT.,others superior; would that therefore contention might be extinguished
13689,ARGUMENT.,"from gods and men; and anger, which is wont to impel even the very"
13690,ARGUMENT.,"wisest to be harsh; and which, much sweeter than distilling honey, like"

13741,ARGUMENT.,"heaven-sent uproar from man-slaughtering Hector, reached the ships and"
13742,ARGUMENT.,the Hellespont. Nor had the well-greaved Greeks drawn off the dead body
13743,ARGUMENT.,"of Patroclus, the attendant of Achilles, out of the reach of weapons;"
13744,ARGUMENT.,"for now again both infantry and cavalry pursued him, and Hector, the"

13746,ARGUMENT.,"Hector seize him behind by the feet, eager to draw him away, and loudly"
13747,ARGUMENT.,"shouted to the Trojans; and thrice did the two Ajaces, clad in"
13748,ARGUMENT.,"impetuous might, forcibly repulse him from the corse; whilst he, with"
13749,ARGUMENT.,"steady purpose, ever relying on his might, sometimes charged through"
13750,ARGUMENT.,"the crowd, and sometimes again stopped, loudly shouting; but never"
13751,ARGUMENT.,retreated altogether. But as night-watching 579 shepherds are by no

13823,ARGUMENT.,"reach the sky. He stood, having advanced from the wall to the trench,"
13824,ARGUMENT.,"nor mingled with the Greeks, for he reverenced the prudent advice of"
13825,ARGUMENT.,"his mother. There standing, he shouted, and Pallas Minerva, on the"
13826,ARGUMENT.,"other side, vociferated, and stirred up immense tumult among the"
13827,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans. And as the tone is very clear, when a trumpet sounds, while"
13828,ARGUMENT.,deadly foes are investing a city; so distinct then was the voice of the
13829,ARGUMENT.,"descendant of Æacus. But when they heard the brazen voice of Achilles,"
13830,ARGUMENT.,"the soul was disturbed to all, whilst the beautiful-maned steeds turned"
13831,ARGUMENT.,"the chariots backwards, for they presaged sorrows in their mind. The"
13832,ARGUMENT.,"charioteers were panic-struck when they beheld the terrific,"
13833,ARGUMENT.,"indefatigable flame, blazing over the head of magnanimous Pelides; for"
13834,ARGUMENT.,the azure-eyed goddess Minerva lighted it. Thrice over the trench
13835,ARGUMENT.,"loudly shouted noble Achilles, and thrice were the Trojans and their"
13836,ARGUMENT.,illustrious allies thrown into confusion. There then perished twelve
13837,ARGUMENT.,"bravest heroes by their chariots and spears, whilst the Greeks,"
13838,ARGUMENT.,"dragging Patroclus with joy out of the reach of weapons, stretched him"
13839,ARGUMENT.,"on a bier; but his beloved companions stood round him mourning, and"
13840,ARGUMENT.,"with them followed swift-footed Achilles, shedding warm tears, when he"
13841,ARGUMENT.,"beheld his faithful comrade lying upon a bier, lacerated with the sharp"
13842,ARGUMENT.,brass: whom indeed he had sent forth with his horses and chariots to
13843,ARGUMENT.,"battle, but did not receive him again, having returned."

13848,ARGUMENT.,
13849,ARGUMENT.,"But the large-eyed, venerable Juno sent the unwearied sun, to return to"
13850,ARGUMENT.,"the flowing of the ocean, against his inclination. The sun then set,"
13851,ARGUMENT.,"and the noble Greeks desisted from the violent conflict, and the"
13852,ARGUMENT.,"equally destructive battle. The Trojans again, on the other side,"
13853,ARGUMENT.,"retiring from the violent combat, loosed their fleet steeds from their"
13854,ARGUMENT.,chariots. But they assembled in the council before they bethought them
13855,ARGUMENT.,"of their banquet. The assembly consisted of persons standing up, nor"
13856,ARGUMENT.,"did any one dare to sit; for fear possessed all, because Achilles had"
13857,ARGUMENT.,"appeared, who had long abstained from the direful combat. Among them"
13858,ARGUMENT.,"prudent Polydamas, the son of Panthus, began to speak, for he alone saw"
13859,ARGUMENT.,"both the future and the past. He was the companion of Hector, and they"
13860,ARGUMENT.,"were born in one night, but the one excelled in counsel, and the other"
13861,ARGUMENT.,"greatly in the spear. He wisely counselling, harangued them, and spoke:"
13862,ARGUMENT.,
13863,ARGUMENT.,"“My friends, consider well on both sides; for I advise that we now"
13864,ARGUMENT.,"return to the city, nor await the sacred Morn in the plain near the"
13865,ARGUMENT.,ships; for we are far away from the wall. As long indeed as this man
13866,ARGUMENT.,"was wroth with noble Agamemnon, so long were the Greeks more easy to"
13867,ARGUMENT.,"fight with. For even I was delighted, passing the night by the swift"
13868,ARGUMENT.,"barks, expecting that we should take the equally-plied barks; but now"
13869,ARGUMENT.,"greatly do I fear swift-footed Pelides: so violent is his soul, nor"
13870,ARGUMENT.,"will he be content to remain in the plain, where usually the Trojans"
13871,ARGUMENT.,"and Greeks in the intervening space divide 585 the force of war, but he"
13872,ARGUMENT.,"will combat for the city and our wives. We will go, then, towards the"
13873,ARGUMENT.,city—be persuaded by me—for so it must be. Ambrosial night at present
13874,ARGUMENT.,"hath made swift-footed Pelides cease; but if, rushing forth to-morrow"
13875,ARGUMENT.,"with his arms, he shall find us here, then will some one know him; for"
13876,ARGUMENT.,"gladly will he reach sacred Ilium, whosoever shall escape: but dogs and"
13877,ARGUMENT.,vultures will devour many of the Trojans. O that such [tidings] may be
13878,ARGUMENT.,"far from our ears. 586 But if we be obedient to my words, although sad,"
13879,ARGUMENT.,"we shall have protection 587 in the assembly during the night, and the"
13880,ARGUMENT.,"towers and lofty gates, and the valves fitted to them, long, well"
13881,ARGUMENT.,"polished, fastened together, will protect the city. But to-morrow, at"
13882,ARGUMENT.,"early dawn, we will stand on the towers, arrayed in armour; and it"
13883,ARGUMENT.,"would be difficult for him, even if he should wish it, coming from the"
13884,ARGUMENT.,"ships, to fight with us around the wall. Back again will he go to the"
13885,ARGUMENT.,"ships, after he has satiated his high-necked steeds with a varied"
13886,ARGUMENT.,"course, driving beneath the city. But his mind will not permit him to"
13887,ARGUMENT.,"rush within, nor will he ever lay it waste; sooner shall the fleet dogs"
13888,ARGUMENT.,devour him.”

13902,ARGUMENT.,"“No longer, O Polydamas, dost thou speak these things agreeable to me,"
13903,ARGUMENT.,"thou who advisest us, returning, to be cooped up in the city. Are ye"
13904,ARGUMENT.,not yet satiated with being shut up within the towers? Formerly indeed
13905,ARGUMENT.,all articulate-speaking men pronounced the city of Priam rich in gold
13906,ARGUMENT.,"and in brass; but now have the rich treasures of our houses perished,"
13907,ARGUMENT.,and many possessions have already departed to Phrygia and agreeable
13908,ARGUMENT.,"Mœonia, to be sold, since mighty Jove was enraged. But at this crisis,"
13909,ARGUMENT.,when the son of politic Saturn has granted me to obtain glory at the
13910,ARGUMENT.,"ships, and to hem in the Greeks by the sea, no longer, foolish man,"
13911,ARGUMENT.,disclose these counsels to the people: for none of the Trojans will
13912,ARGUMENT.,"obey; nor will I permit them. But come, let us all obey as I shall"
13913,ARGUMENT.,advise. At present take supper in your ranks throughout the army; be
13914,ARGUMENT.,"mindful of the watch, and keep guard each [of you]; but whosoever of"
13915,ARGUMENT.,"the Trojans is particularly anxious about his possessions, collecting"
13916,ARGUMENT.,"them together, let him give them to the people to be publicly consumed;"
13917,ARGUMENT.,it is better that any of them should enjoy them than the Greeks. But
13918,ARGUMENT.,"to-morrow, with the dawn, arrayed in armour, let us excite sharp"
13919,ARGUMENT.,"conflict at the hollow ships, and if truly noble Achilles has arisen at"
13920,ARGUMENT.,"the ships, it will be the worse for him, if he wishes [to fight]: I"
13921,ARGUMENT.,"indeed will not fly him from the horrid-sounding battle, but will stand"
13922,ARGUMENT.,"very obstinately against him, whether he bear away great glory, or I"
13923,ARGUMENT.,"bear it away. Mars [is] common, 588 and even slays the slayer.”"

13928,ARGUMENT.,
13929,ARGUMENT.,"Thus Hector harangued, and the Trojans shouted in applause: foolish"
13930,ARGUMENT.,"men, for Pallas Minerva had taken their senses away from them. For they"
13931,ARGUMENT.,"assented to Hector, advising destructive things, whilst no one"
13932,ARGUMENT.,"[assented to] Polydamas, who advised prudent counsel. Then they took"
13933,ARGUMENT.,"supper through the army. But the Greeks, lamenting all night, wept over"
13934,ARGUMENT.,"Patroclus, but among them Pelides led the ceaseless lamentation,"
13935,ARGUMENT.,"placing his man-slaying hands upon the breast of his companion, very"
13936,ARGUMENT.,"frequently sighing; as the well-bearded lion, from whom the stag-hunter"
13937,ARGUMENT.,"has stolen the cubs out of the thick forest; and he is grieved, coming"
13938,ARGUMENT.,"afterwards. And through many valleys he goes, tracking the footsteps of"
13939,ARGUMENT.,"the man, if anywhere he may find him; for very keen rage possesses him."
13940,ARGUMENT.,"So, deeply sighing, he addressed the Myrmidons:"
13941,ARGUMENT.,
13942,ARGUMENT.,"“Alas! vain indeed was the promise I uttered on that day, encouraging"
13943,ARGUMENT.,the hero Menœtius in our halls; for I said that I would bring back his
13944,ARGUMENT.,"illustrious son to Opus, having wasted Troy, and obtained a share of"
13945,ARGUMENT.,the spoil. But Jove fulfils not for men all their intentions; for it is
13946,ARGUMENT.,fated that we shall both stain with blood the same earth here in Troy;
13947,ARGUMENT.,"but neither shall aged horse-driving Peleus receive me in his palaces,"
13948,ARGUMENT.,"returning, nor my mother Thetis, but the earth shall here hold me. Now,"
13949,ARGUMENT.,"however, O Patroclus! since after thee I go beneath the earth, I shall"
13950,ARGUMENT.,"not perform thy funeral rites, before that I bring hither the arms and"
13951,ARGUMENT.,"head of magnanimous Hector, thy murderer, and behead twelve illustrious"
13952,ARGUMENT.,"sons of the Trojans, before thy pile, enraged on account of thee slain."
13953,ARGUMENT.,Meanwhile thou shall lie thus at the crooked ships; and round thee
13954,ARGUMENT.,Trojan [dames] and deep-bosomed Dardanians shall weep and shed tears
13955,ARGUMENT.,night and day; whom we ourselves have toiled to get by our valour and
13956,ARGUMENT.,"the long spear, laying waste the rich cities of articulate-speaking"
13957,ARGUMENT.,men.”
13958,ARGUMENT.,
13959,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having spoken, noble Achilles ordered his companions to surround"
13960,ARGUMENT.,"a large tripod with fire, that as soon as possible they might wash away"
13961,ARGUMENT.,the bloody gore from Patroclus. They then placed a bathing tripod on
13962,ARGUMENT.,"the blazing fire, and poured water into it, and taking fagots, lighted"
13963,ARGUMENT.,"them under it. The fire indeed encircled the belly of the tripod, and"
13964,ARGUMENT.,"the water was warmed. But when the water boiled in the sonorous brass,"
13965,ARGUMENT.,"then they both washed him, and anointed him with rich oil. And they"
13966,ARGUMENT.,filled up his wounds with ointment nine years old; and laying him upon
13967,ARGUMENT.,"a bed, they covered him with fine linen from head to foot; and over"
13968,ARGUMENT.,"all, with a white mantle. 589 All night then the Myrmidons, lamenting"
13969,ARGUMENT.,"Patroclus, wept around swift-footed Achilles. But Jove addressed Juno,"
13970,ARGUMENT.,his sister and wife:
13971,ARGUMENT.,
13972,ARGUMENT.,"“And at length thou hast accomplished thy object, O large-eyed,"
13973,ARGUMENT.,"venerable Juno, having aroused swift-fooled Achilles. Surely the"
13974,ARGUMENT.,waving-crested Greeks are born from thy very self.”
13975,ARGUMENT.,
13976,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 589: (return)  Cf. Virg. Æn. vi. 218, sqq.; xi. 36, sqq. I"
13977,ARGUMENT.,shall defer discussing the heroic funeral-rites till the twenty-third

13979,ARGUMENT.,
13980,ARGUMENT.,"But him large-eyed, venerable Juno then answered:"
13981,ARGUMENT.,
13982,ARGUMENT.,"“Most imperious son of Saturn, what a word hast thou spoken? Surely now"
13983,ARGUMENT.,"any man who is mortal, and knows not so many designs, might accomplish"
13984,ARGUMENT.,"this against a man. How therefore ought not I, who boast myself to be"
13985,ARGUMENT.,"chief of the goddesses, both from birth and also because I am called"
13986,ARGUMENT.,"thy wife (and thou rulest over all the immortals), being enraged with"
13987,ARGUMENT.,"the Trojans, to [be able to] design evils against them.”"
13988,ARGUMENT.,
13989,ARGUMENT.,Thus indeed they conversed with one another. But silver-footed Thetis
13990,ARGUMENT.,"reached the abode of Vulcan, incorruptible, starry, remarkable amongst"
13991,ARGUMENT.,"the immortals, brazen, which the lame-footed himself had constructed."
13992,ARGUMENT.,"Him she found sweating, exerting himself at the bellows, earnestly"
13993,ARGUMENT.,working; for he was making full twenty tripods to stand around the wall
13994,ARGUMENT.,of his well-built palace. Under the base of each he placed golden
13995,ARGUMENT.,"wheels, that of their own accord they might enter the heavenly council,"
13996,ARGUMENT.,"and again return home—a wonder to be seen. So much finish had they, but"
13997,ARGUMENT.,"he had not yet added the well-made handles, which he was preparing; and"
13998,ARGUMENT.,"he was forging the rivets. Whilst he was toiling at these things with,"
13999,ARGUMENT.,"skilful mind, meanwhile Thetis, the silver-footed goddess, came to him."
14000,ARGUMENT.,"But the beautiful and fair-veiled Charis, whom illustrious Vulcan had"
14001,ARGUMENT.,"espoused, advancing, beheld her; and hung upon her hand, and addressed"
14002,ARGUMENT.,"her, and spoke:"
14003,ARGUMENT.,
14004,ARGUMENT.,"“Why, O long-robed Thetis, venerable, beloved, dost thou visit our"
14005,ARGUMENT.,abode? Formerly thou wast not in the habit of coming frequently. 590
14006,ARGUMENT.,"But follow farther onwards, that I may set before thee hospitable"
14007,ARGUMENT.,fare.”
14008,ARGUMENT.,
14009,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having spoken, the divine of goddesses led on. Then indeed she"
14010,ARGUMENT.,"placed her upon a silver-studded throne, beautiful, variously wrought,"
14011,ARGUMENT.,"and there was a stool under her feet. But she called Vulcan, the"
14012,ARGUMENT.,"distinguished artist, and spoke this word:"
14013,ARGUMENT.,
14014,ARGUMENT.,"“Come hither, Vulcan, Thetis now has need of thee.”"
14015,ARGUMENT.,
14016,ARGUMENT.,But her illustrious Vulcan then answered: “Assuredly then an awful and
14017,ARGUMENT.,"revered goddess is within, who saved me when distress came upon me,"
14018,ARGUMENT.,"fallen down far by the contrivance of my shameless mother, who wished"
14019,ARGUMENT.,"to conceal me, being lame. 591 Then should I have suffered sorrows in"
14020,ARGUMENT.,"my mind, had not Eurynome and Thetis received me in their bosom;"
14021,ARGUMENT.,"Eurynome, daughter of the refluent Ocean. With them for nine years"
14022,ARGUMENT.,"wrought I in brass many ingenious works of art, buckles, twisted"
14023,ARGUMENT.,"bracelets, and clasp-tubes, in the hollow cave; whilst round us flowed"
14024,ARGUMENT.,"the immense stream of Ocean, murmuring with foam: nor did any other"
14025,ARGUMENT.,"either of gods or mortal men know it; but Thetis and Eurynome, who"
14026,ARGUMENT.,"preserved me, knew it. She now comes to my house; wherefore there is"
14027,ARGUMENT.,need that I should repay all the rewards of my safety to fair-haired
14028,ARGUMENT.,"Thetis. But set now before her good hospitable fare, whilst I lay aside"

14079,ARGUMENT.,"subjected to a man, to Peleus, son of Æacus; and I have endured the"
14080,ARGUMENT.,"couch of a man very much against my will. He, indeed, now lies in his"
14081,ARGUMENT.,"palaces, afflicted with grievous old age; but now other [woes] are my"
14082,ARGUMENT.,"lot. After he had granted me to bring forth aud nurture a son,"
14083,ARGUMENT.,"distinguished among heroes, and who grew up like a plant; him having"
14084,ARGUMENT.,"reared, as a plant in a fertile spot of the field, I sent forth in the"
14085,ARGUMENT.,"crooked barks to Ilium, to fight with the Trojans; but him I shall not"
14086,ARGUMENT.,"receive again, having returned home to the mansion of Peleus. As long,"
14087,ARGUMENT.,"however, as he lives to me, and beholds the light of the sun, he"
14088,ARGUMENT.,"suffers sorrow, nor am I, going to him, able to avail him aught. The"
14089,ARGUMENT.,"maid whom the sons of the Greeks selected as a reward for him, her hath"
14090,ARGUMENT.,"king Agamemnon taken back again from his hands. Certainly, grieving for"
14091,ARGUMENT.,"her, he has been wasting his soul; whilst the Trojans were hemming in"
14092,ARGUMENT.,"the Greeks at the ships, nor suffered them to go beyond the gates: but"
14093,ARGUMENT.,"the elders of the Greeks supplicated him, and named many distinguished"
14094,ARGUMENT.,"presents. But then he refused to avert destruction, yet he clad"
14095,ARGUMENT.,"Patroclus in his own armour, and sent him forth to the battle, and he"
14096,ARGUMENT.,"gave with him much people. All day they fought round the Scæan gates,"
14097,ARGUMENT.,"and certainly on that day had overturned Troy, had not Apollo slain,"
14098,ARGUMENT.,"among the foremost warriors, the gallant son of Menœtius, after having"
14099,ARGUMENT.,"done much mischief, and given glory to Hector. On this account do I now"

14158,ARGUMENT.,conducting the brides from their chambers through the city with
14159,ARGUMENT.,"brilliant torches, 601 and many a bridal song 602 was raised. The"
14160,ARGUMENT.,"youthful dancers were wheeling round, and amongst them pipes and lyres"
14161,ARGUMENT.,"uttered a sound; and the women standing, each at her portals, admired."
14162,ARGUMENT.,"And people were crowded together in an assembly, and there a contest"
14163,ARGUMENT.,had arisen; for two men contended for the ransom-money of a slain man:
14164,ARGUMENT.,"the one affirmed that he had paid all, appealing to the people; but the"
14165,ARGUMENT.,"other denied, [averring] that he had received nought: and both wished"
14166,ARGUMENT.,to find an end [of the dispute] before a judge. 603 The people were
14167,ARGUMENT.,"applauding both,—supporters of either party, and the heralds were"
14168,ARGUMENT.,"keeping back the people; but the elders sat upon polished stones, in a"
14169,ARGUMENT.,"sacred 604 circle, and [the pleaders 605] held in their hands the"
14170,ARGUMENT.,"staves of the clear-voiced heralds; with these then they arose, and"
14171,ARGUMENT.,"alternately pleaded their cause. Moreover, in the midst lay two talents"
14172,ARGUMENT.,"of gold, to give to him who should best establish his claim among them."
14173,ARGUMENT.,But round the other city sat two armies of people glittering in arms;
14174,ARGUMENT.,"and one of two plans was agreeable to them, 606 either to waste it, or"
14175,ARGUMENT.,"to divide all things into two parts,—the wealth, whatever the pleasant"
14176,ARGUMENT.,"city contained within it. They, however, had not yet complied, but were"
14177,ARGUMENT.,"secretly arming themselves for an ambuscade. Meanwhile, their beloved"
14178,ARGUMENT.,"wives and young children kept watch, standing above, and amongst them"
14179,ARGUMENT.,the men whom old age possessed. But they (the younger men) advanced;
14180,ARGUMENT.,"but Mars was their leader, and Pallas Minerva, both golden, and clad in"
14181,ARGUMENT.,"golden dresses, beautiful and large, along with their armour, radiant"
14182,ARGUMENT.,"all round, and indeed like gods; but the people were of humbler size."
14183,ARGUMENT.,607 But when they now had reached a place where it appeared fit to lay
14184,ARGUMENT.,"an ambuscade, by a river, where there was a watering-place for all"
14185,ARGUMENT.,"sorts of cattle, there then they settled, clad in shining steel. There,"
14186,ARGUMENT.,"apart from the people, sat two spies, watching when they might perceive"
14187,ARGUMENT.,"the sheep and crooked-horned oxen. These, however, soon advanced, and"
14188,ARGUMENT.,"two shepherds accompanied them, amusing themselves with their pipes,"
14189,ARGUMENT.,"for they had not yet perceived the stratagem. Then they, discerning"
14190,ARGUMENT.,"them, ran in upon them, and immediately slaughtered on all sides the"
14191,ARGUMENT.,"herds of oxen, and the beautiful flocks of snow-white sheep; and slew"
14192,ARGUMENT.,"the shepherds besides. But they, when they heard the great tumult"
14193,ARGUMENT.,"amongst the oxen, previously sitting in front of the assembly, 608"
14194,ARGUMENT.,"mounting their nimble-footed steeds, pursued; and soon came up with"
14195,ARGUMENT.,"them. Then, having marshalled themselves, they fought a battle on the"
14196,ARGUMENT.,"banks of the river, and wounded one another with their brazen spears."

14552,ARGUMENT.,"conflict will not be for a short time only, when once the phalanxes of"
14553,ARGUMENT.,"men shall mingle, and a god breathe might into both. But command the"
14554,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks to be fed at the ships with food and wine, for this is might and"
14555,ARGUMENT.,"vigour. For a man, unrefreshed by food, would not be able to fight"

14557,ARGUMENT.,"desire in his mind to fight, yet his limbs gradually grow languid, and"

14559,ARGUMENT.,"man, on the other hand, who is satiated with wine and food, fights all"
14560,ARGUMENT.,"day with hostile men, the heart within his breast is daring, nor are"
14561,ARGUMENT.,"his limbs at all fatigued before that all retire from battle. But come,"

14568,ARGUMENT.,"and to thee thyself, also, let the soul within thy breast be placid."
14569,ARGUMENT.,"Then let him next conciliate thee by a rich banquet within his tents,"
14570,ARGUMENT.,"that thou mayest not have aught wanting of redress. And for the future,"

14605,ARGUMENT.,and the dreadful groans of heroes.”
14606,ARGUMENT.,
14607,ARGUMENT.,"But him much-scheming Ulysses answering, addressed:"
14608,ARGUMENT.,
14609,ARGUMENT.,"“O Achilles, son of Peleus, by far the bravest of the Greeks, thou art"
14610,ARGUMENT.,"superior indeed to me, and not a little more valiant with the spear,"
14611,ARGUMENT.,but I indeed excel thee much in prudence; because I was born before
14612,ARGUMENT.,"thee, and know more: wherefore let thy mind be restrained by my words."
14613,ARGUMENT.,"Soon is there a satiety of contest to the men, a most abundant crop of"
14614,ARGUMENT.,"whom the brass pours upon the earth; but the harvest is very small,"

14616,ARGUMENT.,It is by no means fit that the Greeks should lament the dead with the
14617,ARGUMENT.,"stomach, for in great numbers and one upon another are they every day"
14618,ARGUMENT.,falling; when therefore could any one respire from toil? But it is
14619,ARGUMENT.,"necessary to bury him, whosoever may die, having a patient mind,"
14620,ARGUMENT.,weeping for a day. 632 But as many as survive the hateful combat should
14621,ARGUMENT.,"be mindful of drinking and of food, in order that we may ever the more"

14623,ARGUMENT.,impenetrable brass; nor let any of the troops lie by awaiting another
14624,ARGUMENT.,"exhortation. For evilly will that exhortation come upon him, whoever"
14625,ARGUMENT.,"may be left at the ships of the Greeks; but advancing in a body, let us"

14640,ARGUMENT.,"gold, led the way, and with him the other youths of the Greeks bore the"
14641,ARGUMENT.,"presents, and placed them in the midst of the assembly; but Agamemnon"

14665,ARGUMENT.,"“O father Jove, certainly thou givest great calamities to men; for"

14739,ARGUMENT.,"hear of my father being dead, who now perhaps sheds the tender tear in"
14740,ARGUMENT.,"Phthia from the want of such a son; while I, in a foreign people, wage"

14742,ARGUMENT.,"beloved son, who is nurtured for me at Scyros, if indeed he still"
14743,ARGUMENT.,"lives, godlike Neoptolemus. For formerly the mind within my bosom hoped"
14744,ARGUMENT.,"that I alone should perish here in Troy, far from steed-nourishing"

14746,ARGUMENT.,"back my son in thy black ship from Scyros, and mightst show him"
14747,ARGUMENT.,"everything, my property, my servants, and my great, lofty-domed abode."
14748,ARGUMENT.,"For now I suppose that Peleus is either totally deceased, or that he,"

14752,ARGUMENT.,
14753,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke, weeping; and the elders also groaned, remembering, each"

14756,ARGUMENT.,Minerva addressed winged words:
14757,ARGUMENT.,
14758,ARGUMENT.,"“O daughter mine, thou entirely now desertest thy valiant hero. Is"
14759,ARGUMENT.,Achilles then no longer at all a care to thee in thy mind? He himself
14760,ARGUMENT.,"is sitting before his lofty-beaked ships, bewailing his dear companion;"
14761,ARGUMENT.,while the others have gone to a banquet; but he is unrefreshed and
14762,ARGUMENT.,"unfed. Go, therefore, instil into his breast nectar and delightful"
14763,ARGUMENT.,"ambrosia, that hunger may come not upon him.”"
14764,ARGUMENT.,
14765,ARGUMENT.,"So saying, he urged on Minerva, who was before eager. But she, like"
14766,ARGUMENT.,"unto a broad-winged, shrill-voiced harpy, leaped down from the heavens"
14767,ARGUMENT.,"through the air. The Greeks, however, were then arming themselves"
14768,ARGUMENT.,"throughout the camp, when she instilled into the bosom of Achilles"
14769,ARGUMENT.,"nectar and delightful ambrosia, that unpleasant hunger might not come"
14770,ARGUMENT.,upon his limbs. Then she went to the solid mansion of her powerful
14771,ARGUMENT.,"sire, and they, apart, poured forth from the swift ships."
14772,ARGUMENT.,
14773,ARGUMENT.,"And as when thick snow-flakes fly down from Jove, beneath the force of"
14774,ARGUMENT.,"the cold, air-clearing Boreas; so from the ships were borne out crowded"
14775,ARGUMENT.,"helmets, shining brightly, and bossed shields, strong-cavitied"
14776,ARGUMENT.,"corslets, and ashen spears. But the sheen reached to heaven, and all"
14777,ARGUMENT.,the earth around smiled beneath the splendour of the brass; and a
14778,ARGUMENT.,trampling of the feet of men arose beneath. In the midst noble Achilles
14779,ARGUMENT.,"was armed, and there was a gnashing of his teeth, and his eyes shone"
14780,ARGUMENT.,like a blaze of fire; but intolerable grief entered his heart within
14781,ARGUMENT.,"him, and, enraged against the Trojans, he put on the gifts of the god,"
14782,ARGUMENT.,"which Vulcan, toiling, had fabricated for him. First around his legs he"
14783,ARGUMENT.,"placed the beautiful greaves, joined with silver clasps, next he put on"
14784,ARGUMENT.,"the corslet round his breast, and suspended from his shoulders the"
14785,ARGUMENT.,"brazen, silver-studded sword; then he seized the shield, large and"
14786,ARGUMENT.,"solid, the sheen of which went to a great distance, as of the moon. 639"
14787,ARGUMENT.,And as when from the sea the blaze of a burning fire shines to
14788,ARGUMENT.,"mariners, which is lit aloft amongst the mountains in a solitary place;"

14790,ARGUMENT.,"friends over the fishy deep; so from the shield of Achilles, beautiful"
14791,ARGUMENT.,"and skilfully made, the brightness reached the sky. But raising it, he"
14792,ARGUMENT.,"placed the strong helmet upon his head; and the helmet, crested with"
14793,ARGUMENT.,"horse-hair, shone like a star; and the golden tufts which Vulcan had"
14794,ARGUMENT.,diffused thick around the cone were shaken. Then noble Achilles tried
14795,ARGUMENT.,"himself in his arms if they would fit him, and if his fair limbs would"
14796,ARGUMENT.,"move freely in them; but they were like wings to him, and lifted up the"
14797,ARGUMENT.,shepherd of the people. And from its sheath he drew forth his paternal
14798,ARGUMENT.,"spear, heavy, great, and stout, which no other of the Greeks was able"
14799,ARGUMENT.,"to brandish, but Achilles alone knew how to hurl it—a Pelian ash, which"
14800,ARGUMENT.,"Chiron had cut for his father from the top of Pelion, to be a"
14801,ARGUMENT.,"destruction to heroes. But Automedon and Alcimus, harnessing the"
14802,ARGUMENT.,"steeds, yoked them; and beautiful collars were upon them. They put the"
14803,ARGUMENT.,"bridles into their jaws, and drew back the reins towards the well-glued"
14804,ARGUMENT.,"car, when Automedon, seizing the shining lash, fitted to his hand,"
14805,ARGUMENT.,"leaped into the car; Achilles, armed for battle, mounted behind him,"
14806,ARGUMENT.,glittering in his armour like the shining sun; and terribly he gave
14807,ARGUMENT.,command to the horses of his sire:

14821,ARGUMENT.,

14831,ARGUMENT.,"bravest of the gods, whom fair-haired Latona brought forth, slew him"
14832,ARGUMENT.,"among the front ranks, and gave glory to Hector. And [though] we can"

14893,ARGUMENT.,"against the Trojans, they will not even for a little sustain the"
14894,ARGUMENT.,"swift-footed son of Peleus. Formerly even beholding him, they fled"
14895,ARGUMENT.,terrified; but now when he is grievously enraged in his mind on account
14896,ARGUMENT.,"of his companion, I fear lest he overthrow the wall, even contrary to"

14898,ARGUMENT.,
14899,ARGUMENT.,"Thus spoke Saturnian Jove, and he stirred up the unyielding 641"
14900,ARGUMENT.,"contest; and the gods hastened to proceed to the battle, having"
14901,ARGUMENT.,"discordant minds. Juno, indeed, and Pallas Minerva [went] to the"
14902,ARGUMENT.,"assemblage of the ships, as well as earth-shaking Neptune, and useful"
14903,ARGUMENT.,"Mercury, who excelled in a prudent mind, with whom went Vulcan, looking"
14904,ARGUMENT.,"savage in his might, limping, and under him his weak limbs moved with"

14906,ARGUMENT.,"him unshorn Phœbus, 642 and Diana, delighting in archery, Latona,"
14907,ARGUMENT.,"Xanthus, and laughter-loving Venus. As long as the gods were apart from"
14908,ARGUMENT.,"mortal men, so long the Greeks were greatly elated, because Achilles"
14909,ARGUMENT.,"appeared, for he had long abstained from the dire battle; and a violent"
14910,ARGUMENT.,"tremor came upon the Trojans, upon each of them as to their limbs,"
14911,ARGUMENT.,fearing because they beheld the swift-footed son of Peleus glittering
14912,ARGUMENT.,"in arms, equal to man-slaughtering Mars. But after the Olympians had"
14913,ARGUMENT.,"come to the crowd of men, then arose fierce Contention, the exciter of"
14914,ARGUMENT.,"the people, and Minerva shouted, sometimes standing beside the trench,"
14915,ARGUMENT.,"outside the wall, at other times she loudly shouted along the echoing"
14916,ARGUMENT.,"shores. But Mars yelled aloud on the other side, like unto a dark"
14917,ARGUMENT.,"whirlwind, keenly animating the Trojans from the lofty city, at other"
14918,ARGUMENT.,times running along the Simoïs over Callicolone. 643
14919,ARGUMENT.,
14920,ARGUMENT.,"Thus the blessed gods, inciting both sides, engaged, and among them"
14921,ARGUMENT.,made severe contention to break out. But dreadfully from above
14922,ARGUMENT.,thundered the father of gods and men; whilst beneath Neptune shook the
14923,ARGUMENT.,boundless earth and the lofty summits of the mountains. The roots and
14924,ARGUMENT.,"all the summits of many-rilled Ida were shaken, and the city of the"
14925,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans, and the ships of the Greeks. Pluto himself, king of the nether"
14926,ARGUMENT.,"world, trembled beneath, and leaped up from his throne, terrified, and"
14927,ARGUMENT.,"shouted aloud, lest earth-shaking Neptune should rend asunder the earth"
14928,ARGUMENT.,"over him, and disclose to mortals and immortals his mansions, terrible,"
14929,ARGUMENT.,"squalid, which even the gods loathe. So great a tumult arose from the"
14930,ARGUMENT.,"gods engaging in combat. Against king Neptune, indeed, stood Phœbus"
14931,ARGUMENT.,"Apollo, having his winged shafts, and against Mars the azure-eyed"
14932,ARGUMENT.,"goddess Minerva. Opposed to Juno stood the goddess of the golden bow,"
14933,ARGUMENT.,"huntress Diana, rejoicing in archery, the sister of Apollo; and"
14934,ARGUMENT.,"opposite Latona, the preserver, 644 useful Mercury. Against Vulcan also"

15047,Ω. 549.”,"advanced towards [each other] into the midst of both armies, eager to"
15048,Ω. 549.”,"fight,—Æneas, the son of Anchises, and noble Achilles. And first Æneas,"
15049,Ω. 549.”,"threatening, advanced, nodding with his strong casque; and before his"
15050,Ω. 549.”,"breast he held his impetuous shield, and shook his brazen spear. But on"
15051,Ω. 549.”,"the other side Pelides rushed against him like a destructive lion,"
15052,Ω. 549.”,"which men assembled together, a whole village, are anxious to kill. He,"
15053,Ω. 549.”,"however, at first despising them, proceeds; but when some one of"

15340,Ω. 549.”,"Thus he spoke, boasting; but darkness covered his (Iphition’s) eyes,"
15341,Ω. 549.”,but the horses of the Greeks tore him with the tires of the wheels in
15342,Ω. 549.”,"the front ranks. After him Achilles smote Demoleon, son of Antenor, a"
15343,Ω. 549.”,"brave repeller of the fight, in the temples, through his brazen-cheeked"
15344,Ω. 549.”,"helmet. Nor indeed did the brazen casque resist it, but through it the"
15345,Ω. 549.”,"eager javelin broke the bone, and the whole brain within was defiled;"
15346,Ω. 549.”,"and he subdued him, ardent. Next he wounded with his spear in the back,"
15347,Ω. 549.”,"Hippodamas, as he was leaping down from his chariot, while flying"
15348,Ω. 549.”,"before him. But he breathed out his soul, and groaned, like as when a"
15349,Ω. 549.”,"bull, dragged round the Heliconian king, 665 bellows, as the youths"
15350,Ω. 549.”,"drag him; and the earth-shaker is delighted with them: so, as he"
15351,Ω. 549.”,"moaned, his fierce soul left his bones. But he went with his spear"
15352,Ω. 549.”,"against godlike Polydorus, 666 the son of Priam; but him his father did"
15353,Ω. 549.”,"not permit to fight, because he was the youngest among all, and dearest"
15354,Ω. 549.”,"to him, and surpassed all in speed. Then, indeed, through youthful"
15355,Ω. 549.”,"folly, exhibiting the excellence of his speed, he ran among the front"
15356,Ω. 549.”,ranks till he lost his life. Him noble swift-footed Achilles smote
15357,Ω. 549.”,"rushing by, in the middle of the back, where the golden rings of his"
15358,Ω. 549.”,"belt clasped together, and the doubled corslet met. Right through at"
15359,Ω. 549.”,"the navel pierced the point of the spear, and uttering a groan, he fell"
15360,Ω. 549.”,"upon his knees; a black cloud enveloped him, and stooping down, he"
15361,Ω. 549.”,gathered his intestines in his hands. But when Hector perceived his

15363,Ω. 549.”,"the earth, a darkness was immediately poured over his eyes, nor could"
15364,Ω. 549.”,"he any longer be employed afar off, but advanced towards Achilles, like"
15365,Ω. 549.”,"unto a flame, brandishing his sharp spear. On the other hand, Achilles,"
15366,Ω. 549.”,"as soon as he saw him, leaped up, and boasting, spoke:"

15401,Ω. 549.”,"Achilles, eager to slay him, rushed furiously on, shouting dreadfully;"
15402,Ω. 549.”,"but Apollo, as a god, very easily snatched him away, and covered him"

15421,Ω. 549.”,"and striking the other in close combat with his sword. Also Tros, the"

15424,Ω. 549.”,taking pity on their equal age: fool! who knew not that he would not be

15426,Ω. 549.”,"very ferocious. He (Tros) indeed clasped his knees with his hands,"
15427,Ω. 549.”,"desiring to supplicate him, but he (Achilles) wounded him in the liver"

15431,Ω. 549.”,"immediately the brazen blade went through the other ear. Then, with his"
15432,Ω. 549.”,"large-hilted sword, he smote Echeclus, son of Antenor, in the centre of"
15433,Ω. 549.”,"the head, and the whole sword became tepid with blood; but purple Death"
15434,Ω. 549.”,"and violent Fate seized his eyes. Then Deucalion, where the tendons of"

15436,Ω. 549.”,"spear; but he, weighed down as to his hand, awaited him, perceiving"
15437,Ω. 549.”,"death before him. But he (Achilles) smiting his neck with his sword,"
15438,Ω. 549.”,"knocked the head off afar with its helmet, and the marrow sprang forth"
15439,Ω. 549.”,from the spine; and Deucalion lay extended on the ground. Then he
15440,Ω. 549.”,"hastened to go towards Rigmus, the renowned son of Pireus, who had come"
15441,Ω. 549.”,"from fertile Thrace; whom he smote in the middle with his javelin, and"

15444,Ω. 549.”,"attendant, while turning back the steeds, and threw him from the"

15447,Ω. 549.”,"forest is consumed, and the wind agitating, turns round the flame on"

15449,Ω. 549.”,"deity, following those that were to be slain; and the black earth"
15450,Ω. 549.”,flowed with blood. As when any one yokes broad fore-headed bulls to

15468,ARGUMENT.,"Having divided the Trojan army, Achilles drives one part towards the"
15469,ARGUMENT.,"city, and the other into the Xanthus, where he takes twelve youths"
15470,ARGUMENT.,"alive, in order to sacrifice them at the tomb of Patroclus. He then"
15471,ARGUMENT.,"slays Lycaon and Asteropæus, deriding the river-god, Xanthus, as unable"
15472,ARGUMENT.,to aid his friends. The river endeavours to overwhelm him by the aid of
15473,ARGUMENT.,"Simoïs, but Vulcan defends him from the danger. Single combats of the"
15474,ARGUMENT.,"gods then follow, but they afterwards retire to Olympus. Apollo then"
15475,ARGUMENT.,"leads Achilles away, assuming the form of Agenor, and the Trojans are"
15476,ARGUMENT.,thus enabled to regain the city.
15477,ARGUMENT.,

15479,ARGUMENT.,"But when they at last reached the course of the fairly-flowing river,"
15480,ARGUMENT.,"the eddying Xanthus, which immortal Jove begat; there separating them,"
15481,ARGUMENT.,"he pursued some indeed through the plain towards the city, by the"
15482,ARGUMENT.,"[same] way that the Greeks, on the preceding day, being astounded, had"
15483,ARGUMENT.,"fled, when illustrious Hector raged. By that way were they poured forth"
15484,ARGUMENT.,"terrified; but Juno expanded a dense cloud before them, to check them:"
15485,ARGUMENT.,"but the other half were rolled into the deep-flowing river, with silver"
15486,ARGUMENT.,eddies. But they fell in with a great noise; and the deep streams
15487,ARGUMENT.,"resounded, and the banks around murmured; but they, with clamour, swam"
15488,ARGUMENT.,"here and there, whirled about in the eddies. 668 As when locusts,"
15489,ARGUMENT.,"driven by the force of fire, fly into the air, to escape to a river,"
15490,ARGUMENT.,"but the indefatigable fire, suddenly kindled, blazes, and they fall,"
15491,ARGUMENT.,"through terror into the water: thus, by Achilles, was the resounding"
15492,ARGUMENT.,river of deep-eddied Xanthus filled promiscuously with horses and men.
15493,ARGUMENT.,"But the Jove-sprung [hero] left his spear upon the banks, leaning"
15494,ARGUMENT.,"against a tamarisk; and he leaped in, like unto a god, having only his"
15495,ARGUMENT.,"sword, and meditated destructive deeds in his mind. And he smote on all"
15496,ARGUMENT.,"sides, and a shocking lamentation arose of those who were stricken by"
15497,ARGUMENT.,"the sword, and the water was reddened with blood. And, as when the"
15498,ARGUMENT.,"other fish, flying from a mighty dolphin, fill the inmost recesses of a"
15499,ARGUMENT.,"safe-anchoring harbour, frightened; for he totally devours whatever he"
15500,ARGUMENT.,can catch; so the Trojans hid themselves in caves along the streams of
15501,ARGUMENT.,"the terrible river. But he, when he was wearied as to his hands,"
15502,ARGUMENT.,"slaying, chose twelve youths alive out of the river, a penalty for dead"
15503,ARGUMENT.,"Patroclus, the son of Menœtius. These he led out [of the river],"
15504,ARGUMENT.,"stupified, like fawns. And he bound their hands behind them 669 with"
15505,ARGUMENT.,"well-cut straps, which they themselves bore upon their twisted tunics;"
15506,ARGUMENT.,and gave them to his companions to conduct to the hollow ships. But he
15507,ARGUMENT.,"rushed on again, desiring to slay."

15519,ARGUMENT.,"the river, whom he himself had formerly led away, taking him unwilling"
15520,ARGUMENT.,"from his father’s farm, having come upon him by night: but he, with the"
15521,ARGUMENT.,"sharp brass, was trimming a wild fig-tree of its tender branches, that"
15522,ARGUMENT.,they might become the cinctures of a chariot. But upon him came noble
15523,ARGUMENT.,"Achilles, an unexpected evil; and then, conveying him in his ships, he"
15524,ARGUMENT.,sold him into well-inhabited Lemnos; but the son of Jason gave his
15525,ARGUMENT.,"price. 670 And from thence his guest, Imbrian Eëtion, ransomed him, and"
15526,ARGUMENT.,"gave him many things, and sent him to noble Arisbe; whence, secretly"
15527,ARGUMENT.,"escaping, he reached his father’s house. Returning from Lemnos, for"
15528,ARGUMENT.,"eleven days he was delighted in his soul, with his friends; but on the"
15529,ARGUMENT.,"twelfth the deity again placed him in the hands of Achilles, who was"
15530,ARGUMENT.,"about to send him into the [habitation] of Hades, although not willing"
15531,ARGUMENT.,"to go. But when swift-footed, noble Achilles perceived him naked,"
15532,ARGUMENT.,"without helmet and shield, neither had he a spear, for all these,"
15533,ARGUMENT.,"indeed, he had thrown to the ground, for the sweat overcame him, flying"
15534,ARGUMENT.,"from the river, and fatigue subdued his limbs beneath; but [Achilles]"
15535,ARGUMENT.,"indignant, thus addressed his own great-hearted soul:"
15536,ARGUMENT.,
15537,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 670: (return)  _I.e._ purchase him as a slave.
15538,ARGUMENT.,
15539,ARGUMENT.,"“Ο gods! surely I perceive this, a great marvel, with mine eyes."
15540,ARGUMENT.,Doubtless the magnanimous Trojans whom I have slain will rise again
15541,ARGUMENT.,"from the murky darkness, as now this man has returned, escaping the"
15542,ARGUMENT.,"merciless day, having been sold in sacred Lemnos; nor has the depth of"
15543,ARGUMENT.,"the sea restrained him, which restrains many against their will. But"
15544,ARGUMENT.,"come now, he shall taste the point of my spear, that I may know in my"
15545,ARGUMENT.,"mind, and learn, whether he will in like manner return thence, or"
15546,ARGUMENT.,"whether the fruitful earth will detain him, which detains even the"
15547,ARGUMENT.,mighty.”
15548,ARGUMENT.,
15549,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he pondered, remaining still; but near him came Lycaon, in"
15550,ARGUMENT.,"consternation, anxious to touch his knees; for he very much wished in"
15551,ARGUMENT.,his mind to escape evil death and black fate. Meanwhile noble Achilles
15552,ARGUMENT.,"raised his long spear, desiring to wound him; but he ran in under it,"
15553,ARGUMENT.,"and, stooping, seized his knees, but the spear stuck fixed in the earth"
15554,ARGUMENT.,"over his back, eager to be satiated with human flesh. But he, having"
15555,ARGUMENT.,"grasped his knees with one hand, supplicated him, and with the other"
15556,ARGUMENT.,"held the sharp spear, nor did he let it go; and, supplicating,"
15557,ARGUMENT.,addressed to him winged words:
15558,ARGUMENT.,
15559,ARGUMENT.,"“O Achilles, embracing thy knees, I supplicate thee; but do thou"
15560,ARGUMENT.,"respect and pity me. I am to thee in place of a suppliant, to be"
15561,ARGUMENT.,"revered, O Jove-nurtured one! For with thee I first tasted the fruit of"
15562,ARGUMENT.,"Ceres on that day when thou tookest me in the well-cultivated field,"
15563,ARGUMENT.,"and didst sell 671 me, leading me away from my father and friends, to"
15564,ARGUMENT.,sacred Lemnos; and I brought thee the price of a hundred oxen. But now
15565,ARGUMENT.,"will I redeem myself, giving thrice as many. This is already the"
15566,ARGUMENT.,"twelfth morning to me since I came to Troy, having suffered much, and"
15567,ARGUMENT.,now again pernicious fate has placed me in thy hands. Certainly I must
15568,ARGUMENT.,"be hated by father Jove, who has again given me to thee. For my mother"
15569,ARGUMENT.,"Laothoë, the daughter of aged Altes, brought forth short-lived me, of"
15570,ARGUMENT.,"Altes, who rules over the warlike Lelegans, possessing lofty Padasus,"
15571,ARGUMENT.,"near the Satnio: and Priam possessed his daughter, as well as many"
15572,ARGUMENT.,"others; but from her we two were born, but thou wilt slay both. Him,"
15573,ARGUMENT.,"godlike Polydorus, thou hast subdued already among the foremost"
15574,ARGUMENT.,"infantry, when thou smotest him with the sharp spear, and now will evil"
15575,ARGUMENT.,"be to me here; for I do not think that I shall escape thy hands, since"
15576,ARGUMENT.,"a deity has brought me near thee. Yet another thing will I tell thee,"
15577,ARGUMENT.,"and do thou store it in thy mind. Do not slay me, for I am not of the"
15578,ARGUMENT.,"same womb with Hector, who killed thy companion, both gentle and"
15579,ARGUMENT.,"brave.” Thus then, indeed, the noble son of Priam addressed him,"
15580,ARGUMENT.,supplicating with words; but he heard a stern reply.

15599,ARGUMENT.,
15600,ARGUMENT.,Thus he spoke; but his knees and dear heart were relaxed. He let go the
15601,ARGUMENT.,"spear, indeed, and sat down, stretching out both hands. But Achilles,"
15602,ARGUMENT.,"drawing his sharp sword, smote [him] at the clavicle, near the neck."
15603,ARGUMENT.,"The two-edged sword penetrated totally, and he, prone upon the ground,"

15628,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but the River was the more enraged at heart, and"
15629,ARGUMENT.,revolved in his mind how he might make noble Achilles cease from
15630,ARGUMENT.,"labour, and avert destruction from the Trojans. But meanwhile the son"
15631,ARGUMENT.,"of Peleus, holding his long-shadowed spear, leaped upon Asteropæus, son"
15632,ARGUMENT.,"of Pelegon, desirous to kill him whom the wide-flowing Axius begat, and"
15633,ARGUMENT.,"Peribœa, eldest of the daughters of Accessamenus; for with her had the"
15634,ARGUMENT.,"deep-eddying river been mingled. Against him Achilles rushed; but he,"
15635,ARGUMENT.,"[emerging] from the river, stood opposite, holding two spears; for"
15636,ARGUMENT.,"Xanthus had placed courage in his mind, because he was enraged on"
15637,ARGUMENT.,"account of the youths slain in battle, whom Achilles had slain in the"
15638,ARGUMENT.,"stream, nor pitied them. But when they were now near, advancing towards"
15639,ARGUMENT.,"each other, him first swift-footed, noble Achilles addressed:"
15640,ARGUMENT.,
15641,ARGUMENT.,"“Who, and whence art thou of men, thou who darest to come against me?"
15642,ARGUMENT.,Truly they are the sons of unhappy men who encounter my might.” Him
15643,ARGUMENT.,again the illustrious son of Pelegon addressed: “O magnanimous son of
15644,ARGUMENT.,"Peleus, why dost thou ask my race? I am from fruitful Pæonia, being far"
15645,ARGUMENT.,"off, leading the long-speared Pæonian heroes; and this is now the"
15646,ARGUMENT.,eleventh morning to me since I came to Troy. But my descent is from the
15647,ARGUMENT.,"wide-flowing Axius, who pours the fairest flood upon the earth, he who"
15648,ARGUMENT.,"begat Pelegon, renowned for the spear; who, men say, begat me. But now,"
15649,ARGUMENT.,"O illustrious Achilles, let us fight.”"
15650,ARGUMENT.,
15651,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spake, threatening: but noble Achilles raised the Pelian ash;"
15652,ARGUMENT.,"but the hero Asteropæus [took aim] with both spears at the same time,"
15653,ARGUMENT.,"676 for he was ambidexter. 677 With the one spear he struck the shield,"
15654,ARGUMENT.,nor did it pierce the shield completely through; for the gold
15655,ARGUMENT.,"restrained it, the gift of a god; and the other slightly wounded him"
15656,ARGUMENT.,upon the elbow of the right arm; and the black blood gushed out: but
15657,ARGUMENT.,"the [spear passing] over him, was fixed in the earth, longing to"
15658,ARGUMENT.,satiate itself with his body. But second Achilles hurled his
15659,ARGUMENT.,"straight-flying ashen spear at Asteropæus, anxiously desiring to slay"
15660,ARGUMENT.,"him. From him indeed he erred, and struck the lofty bank, and drove the"
15661,ARGUMENT.,"ashen spear up to the middle in the bank. Then the son of Peleus,"
15662,ARGUMENT.,"drawing his sharp sword from his thigh, eagerly leaped upon him; but he"
15663,ARGUMENT.,"was not able to pluck out, with his strong hand, the ashen spear of"
15664,ARGUMENT.,"Achilles, from the bank. Thrice, indeed, he shook it, desiring to pluck"
15665,ARGUMENT.,"it out, and thrice he failed in strength. And the fourth time he had"
15666,ARGUMENT.,"determined in his mind, bending, to snap the ashen spear of Æacides;"
15667,ARGUMENT.,"but Achilles first, close at hand, took away his life with the sword;"
15668,ARGUMENT.,"for he smote him upon the belly at the navel, and all his bowels were"
15669,ARGUMENT.,"poured out upon the ground, and darkness veiled him, dying, as to his"
15670,ARGUMENT.,"eyes. Then Achilles, leaping upon his breast, despoiled him of his"
15671,ARGUMENT.,"arms, and boasting, spoke:"

15682,ARGUMENT.,"Thou saidst thou wert of the race of a wide-flowing River, but I boast"

15684,ARGUMENT.,"Myrmidons begat me, Peleus, son of Æacus; but Æacus was from Jove;"
15685,ARGUMENT.,"wherefore Jove is more powerful than Rivers flowing into the sea, and"
15686,ARGUMENT.,"the race of Jove again is more powerful than that of a river. Besides,"
15687,ARGUMENT.,"a very great River is at hand to thee, if it can aught defend thee; but"
15688,ARGUMENT.,"it is not lawful to fight with Jove, the son of Saturn. With him"

15693,ARGUMENT.,
15694,ARGUMENT.,"He said, and plucked his brazen spear from the bank. But him he left"
15695,ARGUMENT.,"there, after he had taken away his life, lying in the sand, and the"
15696,ARGUMENT.,"dark water laved him. About him, indeed, the eels and fishes were"
15697,ARGUMENT.,"busied, eating [and] nibbling the fat around his kidneys. But he"

15700,ARGUMENT.,the bravest in the violent conflict bravely subdued by the hands and

15703,ARGUMENT.,"Achilles slain even more Pæonians, had not the deep-eddying River,"
15704,ARGUMENT.,"enraged, addressed him, likening itself to a man, and uttered a voice"
15705,ARGUMENT.,from its deep vortex:
15706,ARGUMENT.,
15707,ARGUMENT.,"“O Achilles, thou excellest, it is true, in strength, but thou doest"
15708,ARGUMENT.,"unworthy acts above [others], for the gods themselves always aid thee."

15710,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans, at least having driven them from me, perform these arduous"
15711,ARGUMENT.,enterprises along the plain. For now are my agreeable streams full of
15712,ARGUMENT.,"dead bodies, nor can I any longer pour my tide into the vast sea,"
15713,ARGUMENT.,"choked up by the dead; whilst thou slayest unsparingly. But come, even"
15714,ARGUMENT.,cease—a stupor seizes me—O chieftain of the people.”

15716,ARGUMENT.,"But him swift-footed Achilles, answering, addressed:"

15739,ARGUMENT.,"by the force of δύων, the actual sunset of evening. The ὀψέ is"
15740,ARGUMENT.,"therefore, strictly speaking, redundant, and appears to be used with"
15741,ARGUMENT.,"reference only to the time past, something in this way: ‘Thou shouldst"
15742,ARGUMENT.,assist the Trojans until the sun sinks late in the west.’”
15743,ARGUMENT.,
15744,ARGUMENT.,"He spoke, and spear-renowned Achilles leaped into the midst, rushing"
15745,ARGUMENT.,"down from the bank. But he (the River) rushed on, raging with a swoln"
15746,ARGUMENT.,"flood, and, turbid, excited all his waves. And it pushed along the"
15747,ARGUMENT.,"numerous corpses, which were in him 680 in abundance, whom Achilles had"
15748,ARGUMENT.,"slain. These he cast out, roaring like a bull, upon the shore; but the"
15749,ARGUMENT.,"living he preserved in his fair streams, concealing them among his"
15750,ARGUMENT.,mighty deep gulfs. And terrible around Achilles stood the disturbed
15751,ARGUMENT.,"wave, and the stream, falling upon his shield, oppressed him, nor could"
15752,ARGUMENT.,"he stand steady on his feet. But he seized with his hands a thriving,"
15753,ARGUMENT.,"large elm; and it, falling from its roots, dislodged the whole bank,"
15754,ARGUMENT.,"and interrupted the beautiful streams with its thick branches, and"
15755,ARGUMENT.,"bridged over the river itself, 681 falling completely in. Then leaping"
15756,ARGUMENT.,"up from the gulf, he hastened to fly over the plain on his rapid feet,"
15757,ARGUMENT.,"terrified. Nor yet did the mighty god desist, but rushed after him,"
15758,ARGUMENT.,"blackening on the surface, that he might make noble Achilles cease from"
15759,ARGUMENT.,"toil, and avert destruction from the Trojans. But the son of Peleus"
15760,ARGUMENT.,"leaped back as far as is the cast of a spear, having the impetuosity of"
15761,ARGUMENT.,"a dark eagle, a hunter, which is at once the strongest and the swiftest"
15762,ARGUMENT.,"of birds. Like unto it he rushed, but the brass clanked dreadfully upon"
15763,ARGUMENT.,"his breast; but he, inclining obliquely, fled from it, and it, flowing"
15764,ARGUMENT.,"from behind, followed with a mighty noise. As when a ditch-worker leads"
15765,ARGUMENT.,a stream of water from a black-flowing fountain through plantations and
15766,ARGUMENT.,"gardens, holding a spade in his hands, and throwing out the"
15767,ARGUMENT.,obstructions from the channel; all the pebbles beneath are agitated as
15768,ARGUMENT.,"it flows along, and, rapidly descending, it murmurs down a sloping"
15769,ARGUMENT.,"declivity, and outstrips even him who directs it: so the water of the"
15770,ARGUMENT.,"river always overtook Achilles, though being nimble; for the gods are"
15771,ARGUMENT.,"more powerful than mortals. As often as swift-footed, noble Achilles"
15772,ARGUMENT.,"attempted to oppose it, and to know whether all the immortals who"
15773,ARGUMENT.,"possess the wide heaven put him to flight, so often did a great billow"
15774,ARGUMENT.,"of the river, flowing from Jove, lave his shoulders from above; whilst"
15775,ARGUMENT.,"he leaped up with his feet, sad in mind, and the rapid stream subdued"
15776,ARGUMENT.,"his knees under him, and withdrew the sand from beneath his feet. But"
15777,ARGUMENT.,"Pelides groaned, looking toward the wide heaven:"

15806,ARGUMENT.,earth-shaking Neptune began discourse:
15807,ARGUMENT.,
15808,ARGUMENT.,"“O son of Peleus, neither now greatly fear, nor yet be at all dismayed;"
15809,ARGUMENT.,"so great allies from among the gods are we to thee, Jove approving it,"
15810,ARGUMENT.,"I and Pallas Minerva, so that it is not decreed that thou shouldst be"
15811,ARGUMENT.,"overcome by a river. It, indeed, shall soon cease, and thou thyself"
15812,ARGUMENT.,"shalt see it. But let us prudently suggest, if thou be obedient, not to"
15813,ARGUMENT.,"stop thy hands from equally destructive war, before thou shalt have"
15814,ARGUMENT.,"enclosed the Trojan army within the renowned walls of Troy, whoever,"
15815,ARGUMENT.,"indeed, can escape: but do thou, having taken away the life of Hector,"
15816,ARGUMENT.,return again to the ships; for we grant to thee to bear away glory.”
15817,ARGUMENT.,
15818,ARGUMENT.,"They indeed having thus spoken, departed to the immortals. But he"
15819,ARGUMENT.,proceeded towards the plain (for the command of the gods strongly
15820,ARGUMENT.,"impelled him), and it was all filled with the overflowed water. Much"
15821,ARGUMENT.,"beautiful armour and corpses of youths slain in battle, floated along;"
15822,ARGUMENT.,but his knees bounded up against the course of it rushing straight
15823,ARGUMENT.,forward; for Minerva had put great strength into him. Nor did Scamander
15824,ARGUMENT.,"remit his strength, but was the more enraged with the son of Peleus."
15825,ARGUMENT.,"And he swelled the wave of the stream, and, shouting, animated Simoïs:"
15826,ARGUMENT.,
15827,ARGUMENT.,"“O dear brother, let us both, at least, restrain the force of the man,"
15828,ARGUMENT.,"since he will quickly destroy the great city of king Priam, for the"
15829,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans resist him not in battle. But aid me very quickly, and fill thy"
15830,ARGUMENT.,"streams of water from thy fountains, and rouse all thy rivulets, raise"
15831,ARGUMENT.,"a great wave, and stir up a mighty confusion of stems and stones, that"
15832,ARGUMENT.,"we may restrain this furious man, who now already is victorious, and is"
15833,ARGUMENT.,bent on deeds equal to the gods. For I think that neither his strength
15834,ARGUMENT.,"will defend him, nor his beauty at all, nor those beautiful arms, which"

15844,ARGUMENT.,"He spoke, and raging aloft, turbid, he rushed upon Achilles, murmuring"
15845,ARGUMENT.,"with foam, with blood, and with dead bodies. Immediately the purple"
15846,ARGUMENT.,"water of the Jove-descended river being raised up, stood, and seized"
15847,ARGUMENT.,"the son of Peleus. But Juno cried aloud, fearing for Achilles, lest the"
15848,ARGUMENT.,mighty deep-eddying river should sweep him away; and immediately
15849,ARGUMENT.,"addressed Vulcan, her beloved son:"
15850,ARGUMENT.,
15851,ARGUMENT.,"“Arise, Vulcan, my son; for we supposed that eddying Xanthus was"
15852,ARGUMENT.,"equally matched in battle against thee; but give aid with all haste,"
15853,ARGUMENT.,and exhibit thy abundant flame. But I will go to excite a severe storm
15854,ARGUMENT.,"of Zephyrus, and rapid Notus from the sea, which bearing a destructive"
15855,ARGUMENT.,"conflagration, may consume the heads and armour of the Trojans. Do"
15856,ARGUMENT.,"thou, therefore, burn the trees upon the banks of Xanthus, and hurl at"
15857,ARGUMENT.,"himself with fire, nor let him at all avert thee by kind words or"
15858,ARGUMENT.,"threats: neither do thou previously restrain thy might; but when I,"
15859,ARGUMENT.,"shouting, shall give the signal, then restrain thy indefatigable fire.”"
15860,ARGUMENT.,
15861,ARGUMENT.,"Thus she spoke; but Vulcan darted forth his fierce-burning fire. First,"
15862,ARGUMENT.,"indeed, he kindled a fire in the plain, and burned many dead bodies,"
15863,ARGUMENT.,"which were in abundance, over it, whom Achilles had slain; so that the"
15864,ARGUMENT.,"whole plain was dried up, and the clear water restrained. And as when"
15865,ARGUMENT.,"an autumnal north wind immediately dries a newly-watered garden, and"
15866,ARGUMENT.,"gratifies him whoever cultivates it, so was the whole plain dried, and"
15867,ARGUMENT.,it consumed the dead; whereupon he turned his all-resplendent flame
15868,ARGUMENT.,"against the river. The elms were burned up, and the willows and"
15869,ARGUMENT.,"tamarisks; the lotus was consumed, and the rushes and reeds, which grew"
15870,ARGUMENT.,in great abundance round the beautiful streams of the river. Harassed
15871,ARGUMENT.,"were the eels and the fishes, which through the whirlpools, [and] which"
15872,ARGUMENT.,"through the fair streams dived here and there, exhausted by the breath"
15873,ARGUMENT.,"of the various artificer Vulcan. The might of the river was burnt up,"
15874,ARGUMENT.,"and he spake, and addressed him:"
15875,ARGUMENT.,
15876,ARGUMENT.,"“None of the gods, O Vulcan, can oppose thee on equal terms, nor can I"
15877,ARGUMENT.,"contend with thee, thus burning with fire. Cease from combat, and let"
15878,ARGUMENT.,noble Achilles instantly expel the Trojans from their city; what have I
15879,ARGUMENT.,to do with contest and assistance?”
15880,ARGUMENT.,
15881,ARGUMENT.,"He spoke, scorched; and his fair streams boiled up. As a caldron"
15882,ARGUMENT.,"pressed by much fire, glows, bubbling up within on all sides, while"
15883,ARGUMENT.,"melting the fat of a delicately-fed sow, whilst the dry wood lies"
15884,ARGUMENT.,"beneath it; so were his fair streams dried up with fire, and the water"
15885,ARGUMENT.,"boiled; nor could he flow on, but was restrained, and the vapour"
15886,ARGUMENT.,"[raised] by the might of crafty Vulcan harassed him. At length,"
15887,ARGUMENT.,"supplicating much, he addressed to Juno winged words:"
15888,ARGUMENT.,
15889,ARGUMENT.,"“O Juno, why does thy son press upon my stream, to annoy [me] beyond"
15890,ARGUMENT.,"others? nor truly am I so much to blame as all the others, as many as"
15891,ARGUMENT.,"are assistants to the Trojans, But I will, however, desist, if thou"
15892,ARGUMENT.,"biddest it; and let him also cease; and I moreover will swear this,"
15893,ARGUMENT.,"that I never will avert the evil day from the Trojans, not even when"
15894,ARGUMENT.,"all burning Troy shall be consumed with destructive fire, and the"
15895,ARGUMENT.,warlike sons of the Greeks shall burn it.”
15896,ARGUMENT.,
15897,ARGUMENT.,"But when the white-armed goddess Juno heard this, she straightway"
15898,ARGUMENT.,"addressed her beloved son Vulcan: “Vulcan, my illustrious son, abstain;"
15899,ARGUMENT.,for it is not fitting thus to persecute an immortal god for the sake of
15900,ARGUMENT.,mortals.”
15901,ARGUMENT.,
15902,ARGUMENT.,"Thus she spoke; and Vulcan extinguished his glowing fire, and the"
15903,ARGUMENT.,refluent water immediately lowered its fair streams. But when the might
15904,ARGUMENT.,"of Xanthus was subdued, then indeed they rested; for Juno restrained"
15905,ARGUMENT.,"herself, though enraged."
15906,ARGUMENT.,
15907,ARGUMENT.,"Among the other gods, however, grievous, troublesome contention fell"
15908,ARGUMENT.,"out, and the inclination in their minds was borne in opposite"
15909,ARGUMENT.,"directions. They engaged with a great tumult, and the wide earth"
15910,ARGUMENT.,"re-echoed, and the mighty heaven resounded around. And Jove heard it,"
15911,ARGUMENT.,"sitting upon Olympus, and his heart laughed with joy, when he beheld"
15912,ARGUMENT.,the gods engaging in contest. Then they did not long stand apart; for
15913,ARGUMENT.,"shield-piercing Mars began, and rushed first against Minerva, holding"
15914,ARGUMENT.,"his brazen spear, and uttered an opprobrious speech:"
15915,ARGUMENT.,
15916,ARGUMENT.,"“Why thus, O most impudent, having boundless audacity, dost thou join"
15917,ARGUMENT.,the gods in battle? Has thy great soul incited thee? Dost thou not
15918,ARGUMENT.,"remember when thou didst urge Diomede, the son of Tydeus, to strike me?"
15919,ARGUMENT.,"And taking the spear thyself, thou didst direct it right against me,"
15920,ARGUMENT.,"and didst lacerate my fair flesh. Now, therefore, I think that I will"
15921,ARGUMENT.,"chastise thee, for all that thou hast done against me.”"
15922,ARGUMENT.,
15923,ARGUMENT.,"So saying, he struck [her] on the fringed ægis, horrible, which not"
15924,ARGUMENT.,even the thunderbolt of Jove will subdue; on it gore-tainted Mars smote
15925,ARGUMENT.,"her with the long spear. But she, retiring, seized in her stout hand a"
15926,ARGUMENT.,"stone lying in the plain, black, rugged, and great, which men of former"
15927,ARGUMENT.,days had set to be the boundary of a field. 684 With this she struck
15928,ARGUMENT.,"fierce Mars upon the neck, and relaxed his knees. Seven acres he"
15929,ARGUMENT.,"covered, falling; as to his hair he was defiled with dust; and his"
15930,ARGUMENT.,"armour rang round him. But Pallas Minerva laughed, and, boasting over"
15931,ARGUMENT.,"him, addressed to him winged words:"

15940,ARGUMENT.,"enraged because thou hast deserted the Greeks, and dost aid the"

15942,ARGUMENT.,
15943,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having spoken, she turned back her bright eyes. But Venus, the"
15944,ARGUMENT.,"daughter of Jove, taking him by the hand, led him away, groaning very"

15946,ARGUMENT.,"white-armed goddess Juno perceived him, immediately to Minerva she"
15947,ARGUMENT.,addressed winged words:
15948,ARGUMENT.,
15949,ARGUMENT.,"“Alas! O child of aegis-bearing Jove, invincible, see how again she,"
15950,ARGUMENT.,"most impudent, leads man-slaughtering Mars through the tumult, from the"
15951,ARGUMENT.,glowing battle. But follow.”
15952,ARGUMENT.,
15953,ARGUMENT.,"Thus she spoke; but Minerva rushed after, and rejoiced in her mind; and"
15954,ARGUMENT.,"springing upon her, smote her with her stout hand on the breast, and"
15955,ARGUMENT.,dissolved her knees and dear heart. Then both of them lay upon the
15956,ARGUMENT.,"fruitful earth; but she, boasting over them, spoke winged words:"
15957,ARGUMENT.,
15958,ARGUMENT.,"“Would that all, as many as are allies to the Trojans, when they fight"
15959,ARGUMENT.,"against the armed Greeks, were so bold and daring, as Venus came an"
15960,ARGUMENT.,"assistant to Mars, to oppose my strength; then had we long since ceased"
15961,ARGUMENT.,"from battle, having overthrown the well-built city of Ilium.”"
15962,ARGUMENT.,
15963,ARGUMENT.,Thus she spoke; but the white-armed goddess Juno smiled. And the
15964,ARGUMENT.,earth-shaking king addressed Apollo:
15965,ARGUMENT.,
15966,ARGUMENT.,"“Phoebus, why do we two stand apart? Nor is it becoming, since the"
15967,ARGUMENT.,"others have begun. This would be disgraceful, if we return without"
15968,ARGUMENT.,"fight to Olympus, and to the brazen-floored mansion of Jove. Commence,"
15969,ARGUMENT.,"for thou art younger by birth; for it would not be proper for me, since"
15970,ARGUMENT.,"I am elder, and know more things. Fool, since thou possessest a"
15971,ARGUMENT.,"senseless heart; nor dost at all remember those things, how many evils"
15972,ARGUMENT.,"we suffered round Ilium, when we alone of the gods, coming from Jove to"
15973,ARGUMENT.,"haughty Laomedon, laboured for a year for a stipulated hire, and he,"
15974,ARGUMENT.,"commanding, gave orders? I indeed built a city and wall for the"
15975,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans, extensive and very beautiful, that the city might be"
15976,ARGUMENT.,"impregnable; whilst thou, O Phoebus, didst feed, his stamping-footed,"
15977,ARGUMENT.,"curved-horned oxen, among the lawns of many-valed, woody Ida. 685 But"
15978,ARGUMENT.,"when now the jocund Hours had brought round the period of payment, then"
15979,ARGUMENT.,"did violent Laomedon forcibly defraud us both of all reward, and having"
15980,ARGUMENT.,"threatened, dismissed us. And beside, 686 he threatened that he would"
15981,ARGUMENT.,"bind our feet and hands from above, and sell us into distant islands;"
15982,ARGUMENT.,and affirmed that he would cut off the ears of both with the brass: but
15983,ARGUMENT.,"we immediately returned back with indignant mind, enraged on account of"
15984,ARGUMENT.,"the rewards which, having promised, he did not make good. Is it for"
15985,ARGUMENT.,this thou dost now gratify the people? Why dost thou not strive along
15986,ARGUMENT.,"with us, that the treaty-breaking Trojans may basely perish from the"
15987,ARGUMENT.,"root, with their children and modest 687 wives?”"

15997,ARGUMENT.,
15998,ARGUMENT.,"But him the far-darting king, Apollo, in turn addressed:"
15999,ARGUMENT.,
16000,ARGUMENT.,"“O Neptune, thou wouldst not say that I am prudent, if I should now"
16001,ARGUMENT.,"contend with thee, for the sake of miserable mortals, who, like the"
16002,ARGUMENT.,"leaves, are at one time very blooming, feeding on the fruit of the soil"
16003,ARGUMENT.,"and at another again, perish without life. Rather let us cease from"
16004,ARGUMENT.,combat as soon as possible; and let them decide the matter themselves.”
16005,ARGUMENT.,
16006,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having spoken, he turned himself back; for he was afraid to come"
16007,ARGUMENT.,"to strife of hands with his uncle. But him his sister, rustic Diana,"
16008,ARGUMENT.,"the mistress of wild beasts, harshly rebuked, and uttered this"
16009,ARGUMENT.,upbraiding speech:
16010,ARGUMENT.,
16011,ARGUMENT.,"“Fliest thou, Far-darter? and hast thou yielded the whole victory to"
16012,ARGUMENT.,"Neptune? and dost thou give easy glory to him? O Fool, why in vain dost"
16013,ARGUMENT.,thou hold an useless bow? No longer now shall I hear thee boasting in
16014,ARGUMENT.,"the halls of our sire, as formerly amongst the immortal gods, that thou"
16015,ARGUMENT.,wouldst fight in opposition to Neptune.”
16016,ARGUMENT.,
16017,ARGUMENT.,Thus she spoke; but her the far-darting Apollo by no means addressed.
16018,ARGUMENT.,"But the venerable spouse of Jove, enraged, rebuked [her] who rejoices"
16019,ARGUMENT.,"in arrows, with reproaching words:"
16020,ARGUMENT.,
16021,ARGUMENT.,"“How darest thou now, fearless wretch, stand against me? A difficult"
16022,ARGUMENT.,"match am I for thee to be opposed to my strength, although thou art a"
16023,ARGUMENT.,"bow-bearer; for Jove has made thee a lioness among women, and suffered"
16024,ARGUMENT.,thee to kill whatever woman thou wilt. Certainly it is better to slay
16025,ARGUMENT.,"wild beasts among the mountains, or rustic stags, than to fight bravely"
16026,ARGUMENT.,"with thy betters. But if thou desirest to have a knowledge of battle,"
16027,ARGUMENT.,"come on, that thou mayest well know how much the better I am; since"
16028,ARGUMENT.,thou opposest strength to me.”
16029,ARGUMENT.,
16030,ARGUMENT.,"She spoke, and with her left hand seized both her (Diana’s) hands at"
16031,ARGUMENT.,"the wrist, and with her right plucked the bow 688 from her shoulders."
16032,ARGUMENT.,"Smiling, she beat her about the ears with it, while she writhed"
16033,ARGUMENT.,"herself; and the fleet arrows fell out [of her quiver, as she moved]."
16034,ARGUMENT.,"Then the goddess fled, weeping, like a dove which flies from a hawk to"
16035,ARGUMENT.,"a hollow rock, her hiding-place, (for neither was it fated that she"
16036,ARGUMENT.,"should be taken by it;) so she fled, weeping, and left her arrows"
16037,ARGUMENT.,there.
16038,ARGUMENT.,
16039,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 688: (return)  I have followed Kennedy, who says: “The"
16040,ARGUMENT.,preferable meaning of τόξα is _arcus_. This Juno employs as an
16041,ARGUMENT.,"instrument of chastisement, to avoid the infliction of which, her"
16042,ARGUMENT.,"antagonist turns from side to side, and whilst thus shifting her"
16043,ARGUMENT.,"position lets fall her arrows, ὀϊστοί, ver. 492.” Others by τόξα"
16044,ARGUMENT.,understood both bow and arrows.
16045,ARGUMENT.,
16046,ARGUMENT.,"But the messenger [Mercury], the slayer of Argos, addressed Latona:"
16047,ARGUMENT.,
16048,ARGUMENT.,"“O Latona, I will by no means fight with thee; for difficult indeed"
16049,ARGUMENT.,would it be to combat with the wives of cloud-compelling Jove; but
16050,ARGUMENT.,"rather, very forward among the immortal gods, boast that thou hast"
16051,ARGUMENT.,conquered me by violent force.”
16052,ARGUMENT.,
16053,ARGUMENT.,Thus indeed he spoke; but Latona collected together the bent bow and
16054,ARGUMENT.,the arrows 689 which had fallen here and there amid the whirl of dust.
16055,ARGUMENT.,"She, having taken the arrows, followed her daughter. But the daughter"
16056,ARGUMENT.,"had arrived at Olympus, and at the brazen-floored palace of Jove, and"
16057,ARGUMENT.,"had sat down at the knees of her father, weeping, whilst her ambrosial"
16058,ARGUMENT.,"robe trembled around; and her the Saturnian father drew towards him,"
16059,ARGUMENT.,"and, sweetly smiling, interrogated her:"
16060,ARGUMENT.,
16061,ARGUMENT.,"“Which now of the heavenly inhabitants, my dear child, has rashly done"
16062,ARGUMENT.,"such things to thee, as if having done some evil openly?”"
16063,ARGUMENT.,
16064,ARGUMENT.,But him the fair-crowned mistress of the chase 690 addressed in turn:
16065,ARGUMENT.,"“Thy spouse, the white-armed Juno, has injured me, O father, from whom"
16066,ARGUMENT.,contention and strife await 691 the immortals.”

16074,ARGUMENT.,"on Chariton, vii. 5, p. 582, ed. Lips."
16075,ARGUMENT.,
16076,ARGUMENT.,Thus they indeed spoke such things with one another. But Phoebus Apollo
16077,ARGUMENT.,came to sacred Ilium; for the wall of the well-built city was a care to
16078,ARGUMENT.,"him, lest the Greeks, contrary to fate, should overthrow it that day."
16079,ARGUMENT.,"The other ever-existing gods, however, repaired to Olympus, some indeed"
16080,ARGUMENT.,"indignant, but others greatly boasting. And they sat down beside their"
16081,ARGUMENT.,"father, the collector of dark clouds: but Achilles slew at once the"
16082,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans themselves, and their solid-hoofed steeds. And as when a smoke,"
16083,ARGUMENT.,"ascending from a burning city, reaches the wide heaven, but the wrath"
16084,ARGUMENT.,"of the gods has excited it; it creates toil to all, and sends griefs"
16085,ARGUMENT.,upon many; so did Achilles cause toil and griefs to the Trojans.
16086,ARGUMENT.,
16087,ARGUMENT.,"Meanwhile aged Priam stood upon a lofty tower, and observed huge"
16088,ARGUMENT.,Achilles: but by him the routed Trojans were easily thrown into
16089,ARGUMENT.,"confusion, nor was there any might in them. Then groaning, he descended"
16090,ARGUMENT.,"from the tower to the ground, in order to direct the illustrious guards"
16091,ARGUMENT.,at the gates along the wall:
16092,ARGUMENT.,
16093,ARGUMENT.,"“Hold the gates open in your hands until the people, flying, come into"
16094,ARGUMENT.,"the city, for Achilles is at hand routing them. Now I think that"
16095,ARGUMENT.,"destructive deeds will be. But, as soon as they revive, hemmed in"
16096,ARGUMENT.,"within the wall, put to again the well-fitted doors, for I tremble lest"
16097,ARGUMENT.,this destructive man rush within the wall.”
16098,ARGUMENT.,
16099,ARGUMENT.,Thus he spoke; but they opened the gates and pushed back the bolts; and
16100,ARGUMENT.,"they being opened, afforded safety. But Apollo leaped out to meet them,"
16101,ARGUMENT.,"that he might avert destruction from the Trojans. Then they, parched"
16102,ARGUMENT.,"with thirst, and covered with dust, fled from the plain directly"
16103,ARGUMENT.,towards the city and the lofty wall; but he furiously pursued with his
16104,ARGUMENT.,"spear; for fierce madness constantly possessed his heart, and he burned"
16105,ARGUMENT.,to bear away glory. Then indeed the sons of the Greeks had taken
16106,ARGUMENT.,"lofty-gated Troy, had not Phoebus Apollo excited noble Agenor, a hero,"
16107,ARGUMENT.,"the son of Antenor, both blameless and brave. And into his heart he"
16108,ARGUMENT.,"threw courage, and he himself stood beside him, leaning against a"
16109,ARGUMENT.,"beech-tree, that he might avert the heavy hands of death; but he was"
16110,ARGUMENT.,"overshadowed by much darkness. But he, when he perceived Achilles, the"
16111,ARGUMENT.,"destroyer of cities, stood still, and much his heart was darkened 692"
16112,ARGUMENT.,"as he remained; and sighing, he thus addressed his own great-hearted"
16113,ARGUMENT.,soul:
16114,ARGUMENT.,
16115,ARGUMENT.,"“Alas, me! if indeed I fly from terrible Achilles, in the way by which"
16116,ARGUMENT.,"the others, routed, are flying, even thus will he seize me, and will"
16117,ARGUMENT.,slay me unwarlike; but if I suffer these to be thrown into confusion by
16118,ARGUMENT.,"Achilles, the son of Peleus, and fly in another direction on my feet"
16119,ARGUMENT.,"from the wall through the Ilian plain, until I reach the lawns of Ida,"
16120,ARGUMENT.,"and enter its thickets; then indeed, having bathed myself at evening in"
16121,ARGUMENT.,"the river, I may return back to Troy, cleansed from sweat. But why does"
16122,ARGUMENT.,my mind commune these things? Truly he may observe me departing from
16123,ARGUMENT.,"the city towards the plain, and, quickly pursuing, may overtake me on"
16124,ARGUMENT.,his swift feet; then will it no longer be possible to escape Death and
16125,ARGUMENT.,Fate; for he is very powerful beyond all men. But if I go against him
16126,ARGUMENT.,in front of the city—for his body also is without doubt vulnerable by
16127,ARGUMENT.,"the sharp brass, there is one soul in it, and men say that he is"
16128,ARGUMENT.,"mortal; although Jove, the son of Saturn, affords him glory.”"
16129,ARGUMENT.,
16130,ARGUMENT.,"So saying, gathering himself up, 693 he awaited Achilles; and his"
16131,ARGUMENT.,valiant heart within him burned to combat and to fight. As a panther
16132,ARGUMENT.,"advances from a deep thicket against a huntsman, 694 nor is aught"
16133,ARGUMENT.,"troubled in mind, nor put to flight, although it hears the yelling; and"
16134,ARGUMENT.,"although anticipating it, he may have wounded, or stricken it,"
16135,ARGUMENT.,"nevertheless, although pierced with a spear, it desists not from the"
16136,ARGUMENT.,"combat, till either it be engaged in close fight, or be subdued. Thus"
16137,ARGUMENT.,"noble Agenor, the son of renowned Antenor, would not fly till he had"
16138,ARGUMENT.,"made trial of Achilles; but, on the contrary, held before him his"
16139,ARGUMENT.,"shield, equal on all sides, and took aim at him with his spear, and"
16140,ARGUMENT.,shouted aloud:
16141,ARGUMENT.,
16142,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 692: (return)  Cf. Donalson on Soph. Antig. 20, where there is"

16155,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans. Fool! certainly many griefs will be effected over it, for in"
16156,ARGUMENT.,"it we are numerous and valiant men, who will defend Ilium for our"
16157,ARGUMENT.,"beloved parents, our wives, and our children. But thou shalt here"
16158,ARGUMENT.,"fulfil thy destiny, although being so terrible, and a daring warrior.”"
16159,ARGUMENT.,
16160,ARGUMENT.,"He spoke, and hurled the sharp javelin from his heavy hand, and struck"
16161,ARGUMENT.,"him in the shin below the knee, nor missed: but the greave of"
16162,ARGUMENT.,newly-wrought tin around [it] horribly resounded; and the brazen weapon
16163,ARGUMENT.,"recoiled from it stricken, nor penetrated: for the gifts of the god"
16164,ARGUMENT.,prevented it. Then the son of Peleus next attacked godlike Agenor; nor
16165,ARGUMENT.,"did Apollo permit him to obtain glory; but snatched him away, and"
16166,ARGUMENT.,covered him with much haze; and sent him to return peacefully from the
16167,ARGUMENT.,battle.
16168,ARGUMENT.,
16169,ARGUMENT.,But he by a stratagem averted the son of Peleus from the people; for
16170,ARGUMENT.,"the Far-darter, having likened himself in every respect to Agenor,"
16171,ARGUMENT.,stood before his feet; and he hastened to pursue him with his feet.
16172,ARGUMENT.,"Whilst he was pursuing him, running before at a small interval, over"
16173,ARGUMENT.,"the corn-bearing plain, turned towards the deep-eddying river"
16174,ARGUMENT.,"Scamander; (for Apollo beguiled him by deceit, so that he always"
16175,ARGUMENT.,expected to overtake him on his feet;) meanwhile the other Trojans
16176,ARGUMENT.,"being routed, came delighted in a crowd to the city; and the city was"
16177,ARGUMENT.,full of them shut in. Nor did they any longer dare to wait for each
16178,ARGUMENT.,"other without the city and the wall, and to inquire who had escaped,"
16179,ARGUMENT.,and who had fallen in the battle; but gladly they were poured into the
16180,ARGUMENT.,"city, whomsoever of them the feet and knees preserved."

16205,ARGUMENT.,I am a god; but thou incessantly ragest. For certainly the labour of

16208,ARGUMENT.,"Neither canst thou slay me, since I am not mortal.”"

16210,ARGUMENT.,"But him swift-footed Achilles, greatly indignant, 695 addressed:"

16222,ARGUMENT.,
16223,ARGUMENT.,"“Thou hast injured me, O Far-darter, most destructive of all gods,"
16224,ARGUMENT.,having now turned me away hither from the wall; certainly many had now
16225,ARGUMENT.,"seized the earth with their teeth, before they had arrived at Ilium."
16226,ARGUMENT.,"But now hast thou deprived me of great glory, and hast preserved them"
16227,ARGUMENT.,"easily, for thou didst not at all dread vengeance after. Certainly I"
16228,ARGUMENT.,"would punish thee, if the power at least were mine.”"
16229,ARGUMENT.,
16230,ARGUMENT.,"Thus saying, he went towards the city greatly elate, hastening like a"
16231,ARGUMENT.,"steed which bears away the prize, with his chariot, which striving"
16232,ARGUMENT.,"hard, runs swiftly over the plain. So Achilles briskly moved his feet"
16233,ARGUMENT.,and his knees.
16234,ARGUMENT.,
16235,ARGUMENT.,"But him aged Priam first beheld with his eyes, rushing over the plain,"
16236,ARGUMENT.,all shining like a star which rises in autumn; and its resplendent rays
16237,ARGUMENT.,"shine among many stars in the depth of the night, which by name they"
16238,ARGUMENT.,"call the dog of Orion. Very bright indeed is this, but it is a baleful"
16239,ARGUMENT.,"sign, and brings violent heat upon miserable mortals. So shone the"
16240,ARGUMENT.,"brass round the breast of him running. But the old man groaned, and"
16241,ARGUMENT.,"smote his head with his hands, raising them on high, 696 and, groaning,"
16242,ARGUMENT.,"he cried out greatly, supplicating his dear son. But he stood before"
16243,ARGUMENT.,"the Scæan gates, insatiably eager to fight with Achilles; but the old"
16244,ARGUMENT.,"man piteously addressed him, stretching out his hands:"

16254,ARGUMENT.,depart from my heart. He who has made me deprived of many and brave

16256,ARGUMENT.,"the Trojans being shut up in the city, I cannot see my two sons, Lycaon"

16258,ARGUMENT.,"indeed they live at the camp, surely we will afterwards redeem them"
16259,ARGUMENT.,"with brass and with gold; for it is within; for aged Altes, renowned by"
16260,ARGUMENT.,"fame, gave many things to his daughter. But if they are already dead,"

16262,ARGUMENT.,"mother, we who gave them birth. But to the other people the grief will"
16263,ARGUMENT.,"be shorter, if thou shouldst not die, subdued by Achilles. But come"
16264,ARGUMENT.,"inside the wall, O my son, that thou mayest save the Trojan men and"
16265,ARGUMENT.,"women, nor afford great glory to the son of Peleus, and thou thyself be"
16266,ARGUMENT.,"deprived of thy dear life. Moreover, pity me, wretched, yet still"
16267,ARGUMENT.,"preserving my senses, 697 unhappy, whom the Saturnian sire will destroy"
16268,ARGUMENT.,"by grievous fate, upon the threshold of old age, having seen many"
16269,ARGUMENT.,"evils, 698 my sons slain, my daughters dragged captives, their chambers"

16274,ARGUMENT.,"my portals, will tear at the entrance of the gates, 699 after some one,"
16275,ARGUMENT.,"having stricken or wounded me with the sharp brass, shall take away my"

16297,ARGUMENT.,"reverence these things, and pity me myself. If ever I afforded thee the"
16298,ARGUMENT.,"grief-lulling breast, remember these things, O dear son; and being"
16299,ARGUMENT.,"within the wall, repel [this] hostile man; nor stand a foremost"
16300,ARGUMENT.,"adversary to him. Wretched one! for if he shall slay thee, neither"
16301,ARGUMENT.,"shall I mourn thee on the couch, my dear offspring, whom I myself"
16302,ARGUMENT.,"brought forth, nor will thy rich-dowered wife; but far away from us"
16303,ARGUMENT.,"both, the swift dogs will devour thee at the ships of the Greeks.”"
16304,ARGUMENT.,
16305,ARGUMENT.,"Thus weeping, they twain addressed their dear son, supplicating him"
16306,ARGUMENT.,much; nor did they persuade the mind of Hector; but he awaited huge
16307,ARGUMENT.,"Achilles, coming near. And as a fierce serpent at its den, fed on evil"
16308,ARGUMENT.,"poisons, awaits 700 a man, but direful rage enters it, and it glares"
16309,ARGUMENT.,"horribly, coiling itself around its den; so Hector, possessing"
16310,ARGUMENT.,"inextinguishable courage, retired not, leaning his splendid shield"
16311,ARGUMENT.,"against a projecting tower; but, indignant, he thus addressed his own"
16312,ARGUMENT.,great-hearted soul: 701
16313,ARGUMENT.,
16314,ARGUMENT.,"“Ah me, if indeed I enter the gates and the wall, Polydamas will first"
16315,ARGUMENT.,"cast reproach upon me, 702 he who advised me to lead the Trojans"
16316,ARGUMENT.,"towards the city in this disastrous night, when noble Achilles arose to"
16317,ARGUMENT.,battle. But I did not obey; certainly it would have been much better.
16318,ARGUMENT.,"And now, since by my injurious obstinacy I have destroyed the people, I"
16319,ARGUMENT.,"fear the Trojan men, and the long-robed Trojan women, lest some one"
16320,ARGUMENT.,"inferior to me should say, ‘Hector, relying on his own strength, has"
16321,ARGUMENT.,destroyed the people.’ Thus will they say; but it would have been far
16322,ARGUMENT.,"better for me, slaying Achilles in the encounter, 703 to return, or"
16323,ARGUMENT.,gloriously to be slain by him for the city. But if now I shall lay down
16324,ARGUMENT.,"my bossed shield and stout helmet, and, resting my spear against the"
16325,ARGUMENT.,"wall, I myself going, shall come before renowned Achilles, and promise"
16326,ARGUMENT.,"that we will give to the Atrides to lead away Helen, and all the"
16327,ARGUMENT.,"numerous possessions along with her, whatever Paris brought to Troy in"
16328,ARGUMENT.,"his hollow barks, and who was the origin of the contention, and at the"
16329,ARGUMENT.,"same time that we will divide others, as many as this city contains,"
16330,ARGUMENT.,"among the Greeks,—but again I should exact an oath from the elders of"
16331,ARGUMENT.,"the Trojans, 704 that they would conceal nothing, but divide all things"
16332,ARGUMENT.,"into two portions, whatever treasure this delightful city contains"
16333,ARGUMENT.,"within it. Yet why does my soul discuss such things? [I dread] lest I,"
16334,ARGUMENT.,"going, should reach him, but he pity me not, nor at all respect me, but"
16335,ARGUMENT.,"slay me, being thus naked, as a woman, after I have put off my armour."
16336,ARGUMENT.,"Nor, indeed, is it now allowed to converse with him from an oak, or"
16337,ARGUMENT.,"from a rock, as a virgin and a youth; a virgin and youth converse with"
16338,ARGUMENT.,one another. But it is better to engage him in strife; that as soon as

16360,ARGUMENT.,
16361,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he pondered, remaining; but near him came Achilles, like unto the"
16362,ARGUMENT.,"helmet-shaking warrior, Mars, brandishing upon his right shoulder the"
16363,ARGUMENT.,"dreadful Pelian ash; but the brass shone around, like unto the"
16364,ARGUMENT.,"splendour either of a blazing fire, or of the rising sun. Then, as"
16365,ARGUMENT.,"tremor seized Hector, he perceived him, nor could he remain there any"
16366,ARGUMENT.,"longer, but he left the gates behind him, and fled affrighted; but the"
16367,ARGUMENT.,"son of Peleus rushed on, trusting to his swift feet. As a falcon in the"
16368,ARGUMENT.,"mountains, the swiftest of birds, easily dashes after a timid pigeon;"
16369,ARGUMENT.,"she, indeed, flies away obliquely; but he, close at hand, shrilly"
16370,ARGUMENT.,"screaming, frequently assails, and his spirit orders him to seize her:"
16371,ARGUMENT.,"thus, eager, he flew right on; but Hector fled in terror under the wall"
16372,ARGUMENT.,"of the Trojans, and moved his fleet limbs. Then they rushed by the"
16373,ARGUMENT.,"prospect-ground and the wind-waving fig-tree, always under the wall"
16374,ARGUMENT.,"along the public way, and reached the two fair-flowing springs, where"
16375,ARGUMENT.,"the two springs of the eddying Scamander rise. The one, indeed, flows"
16376,ARGUMENT.,"with tepid water, and a steam arises from it around, as of burning"
16377,ARGUMENT.,"fire; whilst the other flows forth in the summer time, like unto hail,"
16378,ARGUMENT.,"or cold snow, or ice from water. There, at them, are the wide, handsome"
16379,ARGUMENT.,"stone basins, where the wives and fair daughters of the Trojans used to"
16380,ARGUMENT.,"wash their splendid garments formerly in time of peace, before the sons"
16381,ARGUMENT.,of the Greeks arrived. In this direction they ran past [the one]
16382,ARGUMENT.,"flying, but the other pursuing from behind. A brave man, indeed, fled"
16383,ARGUMENT.,"before, but a much braver swiftly pursued him; since they did not seek"
16384,ARGUMENT.,"to obtain a victim or a bull’s hide, such as are the rewards of men for"
16385,ARGUMENT.,"speed, but they ran for the life of horse-breaking Hector. And as when"
16386,ARGUMENT.,prize-winning 705 solid-hoofed steeds ran very swiftly round the
16387,ARGUMENT.,"course, and a great reward is proposed, either a tripod, or a woman [in"
16388,ARGUMENT.,honour] of a deceased hero; so they thrice made the circuit of the city
16389,ARGUMENT.,of Priam with their swift feet: and all the gods beheld. Then to them
16390,ARGUMENT.,the father of men and gods commenced an address:
16391,ARGUMENT.,
16392,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 705: (return)  _I.e._ race horses.
16393,ARGUMENT.,
16394,ARGUMENT.,“Alas! certainly I behold with mine eyes a beloved hero pursued round
16395,ARGUMENT.,"the wall; and my heart is grieved on account of Hector, who has"
16396,ARGUMENT.,"sacrificed many thighs of oxen to me, upon the tops of many-valed Ida,"
16397,ARGUMENT.,"and at other times again in the highest [places of] the city; but now,"
16398,ARGUMENT.,"indeed, noble Achilles pursues him, on swift feet, around the city of"
16399,ARGUMENT.,"Priam. But come, deliberate, O ye gods, and consider, whether we shall"
16400,ARGUMENT.,"preserve him from death, or shall subdue him now, being brave [at the"
16401,ARGUMENT.,"hands of] Achilles, the son of Peleus.”"
16402,ARGUMENT.,
16403,ARGUMENT.,But him the blue-eyed goddess Minerva then addressed:
16404,ARGUMENT.,
16405,ARGUMENT.,"“O father, hurler of the white thunder, [collector] of dark clouds,"
16406,ARGUMENT.,what a word hast thou spoken! Dost thou wish to liberate from sad death
16407,ARGUMENT.,"a man, being mortal, long ago destined to fate? Do it: but all we, the"
16408,ARGUMENT.,"other gods, will not assent to thee.”"
16409,ARGUMENT.,
16410,ARGUMENT.,"Her, then, the cloud-compelling Jupiter, answering, addressed: “Take"
16411,ARGUMENT.,"courage, Tritonia, beloved child: I by no means speak with serious"
16412,ARGUMENT.,"mind, but I wish to be mild to thee. Do as is the inclination, nor"
16413,ARGUMENT.,delay at all.”
16414,ARGUMENT.,
16415,ARGUMENT.,"Thus speaking, he incited Minerva, already prepared; and, springing"
16416,ARGUMENT.,"forth, she descended down from the heights of Olympus."
16417,ARGUMENT.,
16418,ARGUMENT.,"But swift Achilles pursued Hector, incessantly pressing upon him. And"
16419,ARGUMENT.,"as when a dog pursues the fawn of a deer in the mountains, having"
16420,ARGUMENT.,"roused it from its lair, through both glens and thickets; and, although"
16421,ARGUMENT.,"panic-stricken, it crouches down beneath a brake; yet tracking it, he"
16422,ARGUMENT.,runs continually on until he finds it; so Hector eluded not the
16423,ARGUMENT.,swift-footed son of Peleus. As often as he would rush against the
16424,ARGUMENT.,"Dardanian gates, towards under the well-built towers, if perchance they"
16425,ARGUMENT.,"might aid him with missile weapons from above, so often, previously"
16426,ARGUMENT.,"anticipating him, he turned him away towards the plain; whilst he"
16427,ARGUMENT.,himself always flew on the side of the city. And as in a dream one
16428,ARGUMENT.,"cannot pursue a fugitive; neither can the one escape the other, nor the"
16429,ARGUMENT.,"other pursue: so the one could not overtake the other in his speed, nor"
16430,ARGUMENT.,"the other escape him. But how, then, could Hector have escaped the"
16431,ARGUMENT.,"fates of death, if Apollo had not, for the very last time, met him, who"
16432,ARGUMENT.,aroused for him his courage and swift knees? But noble Achilles nodded
16433,ARGUMENT.,"to the people with his head, nor permitted them to cast their bitter"
16434,ARGUMENT.,"weapons at Hector, lest some one, wounding him, should obtain the"
16435,ARGUMENT.,"glory, and he himself come second. But when for the fourth time they"
16436,ARGUMENT.,"arrived at the fountains, then, indeed, the Sire raised aloft his"
16437,ARGUMENT.,"golden scales, and placed in them the two fates of death, bearing long"
16438,ARGUMENT.,"sleep, this of Achilles, but that of horse-breaking Hector. Holding"
16439,ARGUMENT.,"them by the middle, he poised them, and the fatal day of Hector"
16440,ARGUMENT.,inclined and sunk to Hades; but Phœbus Apollo left him.
16441,ARGUMENT.,
16442,ARGUMENT.,"Then the blue-eyed goddess Minerva approached the son of Peleus, and,"
16443,ARGUMENT.,"standing near, addressed to him winged words:"
16444,ARGUMENT.,
16445,ARGUMENT.,"“Now, O illustrious Achilles, dear to Jove, I hope that we two shall"
16446,ARGUMENT.,"bear back great glory to the Greeks at the ships, having slain Hector,"
16447,ARGUMENT.,"although being insatiate of war. Now, certainly, it is no longer"
16448,ARGUMENT.,"possible for him to escape us, not even if far-darting Apollo should"
16449,ARGUMENT.,"toil much, throwing himself at the feet of the ægis-bearing father"
16450,ARGUMENT.,"Jove. But do thou now stand and revive; but I, approaching with thee,"
16451,ARGUMENT.,will persuade him to engage thee face to face.”
16452,ARGUMENT.,
16453,ARGUMENT.,"Thus spoke Minerva; but he obeyed, and rejoiced in his mind; and stood,"
16454,ARGUMENT.,"leaning upon his ashen, brass-pointed spear. But she then left him, and"
16455,ARGUMENT.,"overtook noble Hector, likening herself to Deïphobus, unwearied in her"
16456,ARGUMENT.,"body and voice; and, standing near, she addressed to him winged words:"
16457,ARGUMENT.,"“O brother dear, certainly swift Achilles now greatly presses on thee,"
16458,ARGUMENT.,"pursuing thee with rapid feet round the city of Priam. But come now,"
16459,ARGUMENT.,"let us stand, and, awaiting, repulse him.”"
16460,ARGUMENT.,
16461,ARGUMENT.,But her mighty crest-tossing Hector in turn addressed:
16462,ARGUMENT.,
16463,ARGUMENT.,"“Deïphobus, surely thou wert ever before by far the dearest to me of my"
16464,ARGUMENT.,"brothers, the sons whom Hecuba and Priam produced. But now I think in"
16465,ARGUMENT.,"my mind that I honour thee still more, since thou hast dared for my"
16466,ARGUMENT.,"sake, when thou dost behold [me] with thine eyes, to come out of the"
16467,ARGUMENT.,city; while others remain within.”
16468,ARGUMENT.,
16469,ARGUMENT.,But him the azure-eyed goddess Minerva in turn addressed:
16470,ARGUMENT.,
16471,ARGUMENT.,"“My brother dear, my father and venerable mother indeed greatly"
16472,ARGUMENT.,"supplicated me, by turn embracing my knees and my companions around, to"
16473,ARGUMENT.,remain there (so much do all tremble with fear); but my mind within was
16474,ARGUMENT.,"harassed with sad grief. But now let us forthwith eagerly engage, nor"
16475,ARGUMENT.,"let there any longer be a sparing of our spears, that we may know"
16476,ARGUMENT.,"whether Achilles, having slain us both, shall bear our bloody spoils to"
16477,ARGUMENT.,"the hollow barks, or be subdued by thy spear.”"
16478,ARGUMENT.,
16479,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having spoken, Minerva also with deception led on. But when they"
16480,ARGUMENT.,"were near advancing towards each other, him mighty crest-tossing Hector"
16481,ARGUMENT.,first addressed:
16482,ARGUMENT.,
16483,ARGUMENT.,"“No longer, O son of Peleus, will I fly thee as before. Thrice have I"
16484,ARGUMENT.,"fled round the great city of Priam, nor ever dared to await thee coming"
16485,ARGUMENT.,on; but now my mind urges me to stand against thee: certainly I shall
16486,ARGUMENT.,"slay, or be slain. But come, let us attest the gods; for they will be"
16487,ARGUMENT.,the best witnesses and observers of agreements. For neither will I
16488,ARGUMENT.,"cruelly insult thee, if indeed Jove shall give me the victory, and I"
16489,ARGUMENT.,"take away thy life; but after I shall despoil thy beautiful armour, O"
16490,ARGUMENT.,"Achilles, I will give back thy body to the Greeks; and so also do"
16491,ARGUMENT.,thou.”
16492,ARGUMENT.,
16493,ARGUMENT.,"But him swift-footed Achilles sternly regarding, addressed:"
16494,ARGUMENT.,
16495,ARGUMENT.,"“Talk not to me of covenants, O most cursed Hector. As there are not"
16496,ARGUMENT.,"faithful leagues between lions and men, nor yet have wolves and lambs"
16497,ARGUMENT.,"an according mind, 706 but ever meditate evils against each other; so"
16498,ARGUMENT.,"it is not possible for thee and me to contract a friendship, nor shall"
16499,ARGUMENT.,"there at all be leagues between us,—first shall one, falling, satiate"
16500,ARGUMENT.,the invincible warrior Mars with his blood. Call to mind all thy
16501,ARGUMENT.,valour; now it is very necessary for thee to be both a spearman and a
16502,ARGUMENT.,"daring warrior. Nor is there any longer any escape for thee, for Pallas"
16503,ARGUMENT.,"Minerva at once subdues thee beneath my spear, and thou shalt now pay"
16504,ARGUMENT.,"for all the accumulated sorrows of my companions, whom thou hast slain,"
16505,ARGUMENT.,raging with the spear.”
16506,ARGUMENT.,
16507,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 706: (return)  See Duport, p. 127; and cf. Hor. Epod. iv. 1."
16508,ARGUMENT.,
16509,ARGUMENT.,"He spoke, and brandishing it, sent forth his long-shadowed spear, and"
16510,ARGUMENT.,"illustrious Hector, seeing it opposite, avoided it; for, looking before"
16511,ARGUMENT.,"him, he sunk down, and the brazen spear passed over him, and was fixed"
16512,ARGUMENT.,"in the earth. But Pallas Minerva plucked it out, and gave it back to"
16513,ARGUMENT.,"Achilles, and escaped the notice of Hector, the shepherd of the people."
16514,ARGUMENT.,Then Hector addressed the illustrious son of Peleus:
16515,ARGUMENT.,
16516,ARGUMENT.,"“Thou hast erred, O godlike Achilles, nor art thou yet acquainted with"
16517,ARGUMENT.,"my fate from Jove; certainly thou didst say so, but thou art a prater,"
16518,ARGUMENT.,"and very subtle in words, in order that, dreading thee, I may be"
16519,ARGUMENT.,"forgetful of my strength and courage. But not in my back, whilst"
16520,ARGUMENT.,"flying, shalt thou thrust thy spear, but shalt drive it through my"
16521,ARGUMENT.,"breast, rushing right on, if God grants this to thee. But now in turn"
16522,ARGUMENT.,avoid my brazen spear! would that thou mightst now receive it all in
16523,ARGUMENT.,"thy body. Then truly would the war become lighter to the Trojans, thou"
16524,ARGUMENT.,being slain; for thou art the greatest bane to them.”
16525,ARGUMENT.,
16526,ARGUMENT.,"He spoke, and, brandishing, sent forth his long-shadowed spear, and"
16527,ARGUMENT.,"struck the centre of Pelides’ shield, nor missed; but the spear was"
16528,ARGUMENT.,repelled far away from the shield. But Hector was enraged because his
16529,ARGUMENT.,"swift weapon had fled in vain from his hand; and stood dejected, for he"
16530,ARGUMENT.,had not another ashen spear. Then he called upon the white-shielded
16531,ARGUMENT.,"Deïphobus, greatly shouting, [and] he asked him for a long spear; but"
16532,ARGUMENT.,"he was not near him; and Hector perceived in his mind, and said:"
16533,ARGUMENT.,
16534,ARGUMENT.,"“Alas! without doubt, now the gods have summoned me to death. For I"
16535,ARGUMENT.,indeed thought the hero Deïphobus was by my side; but he is within the
16536,ARGUMENT.,"wall, and Minerva has deceived me. But now is evil death near me, nor"
16537,ARGUMENT.,"far away, neither is there escape. Certainly this long since was more"
16538,ARGUMENT.,"agreeable to Jove and to the far-darting son of Jove, who formerly,"
16539,ARGUMENT.,"propitious, preserved me; but now, on the contrary, Fate overtakes me."
16540,ARGUMENT.,"Nevertheless I will not perish cowardly and ingloriously at least, but"
16541,ARGUMENT.,having done some great deed to be heard of even by posterity.”
16542,ARGUMENT.,
16543,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having spoken, he drew his sharp sword, which hung below his"
16544,ARGUMENT.,"loins, both huge and strong, and, with collected might, rushed forward,"
16545,ARGUMENT.,"like a lofty-soaring eagle, which swoops to the plain through the"
16546,ARGUMENT.,"gloomy clouds, about to snatch either a tender lamb, or a timid hare;"
16547,ARGUMENT.,"thus Hector rushed forward, brandishing his sharp sword. Achilles also"
16548,ARGUMENT.,"rushed on, and filled his soul with fierce rage. He sheltered his"
16549,ARGUMENT.,"breast in front with his shield, beautiful, curiously wrought and"
16550,ARGUMENT.,"nodded with his shining helmet, four-coned; but the beautiful golden"
16551,ARGUMENT.,"tufts, which Vulcan had diffused in great abundance round the cone,"
16552,ARGUMENT.,"were shaken. As the star Hesperus, which is placed the brightest star"
16553,ARGUMENT.,"in heaven, 707 proceeds amongst other stars in the unseasonable time of"
16554,ARGUMENT.,"night, so it shone from the well-sharpened spear which Achilles,"
16555,ARGUMENT.,"designing mischief to noble Hector, brandished in his right hand,"
16556,ARGUMENT.,"eyeing his fair person, where it would best yield. But the beautiful"
16557,ARGUMENT.,"brazen armour, of which he had despoiled great Patroclus, having slain"
16558,ARGUMENT.,"him, covered the rest of his body so much; yet did there appear [a"
16559,ARGUMENT.,"part] where the collar-bones separate the neck from the shoulders, and"
16560,ARGUMENT.,"where the destruction of life is most speedy. There noble Achilles,"
16561,ARGUMENT.,"eager, drove into him with the spear, and the point went out quite"
16562,ARGUMENT.,"through his tender neck. However the ash, heavy with brass, did not cut"
16563,ARGUMENT.,"away the windpipe, so that, answering in words, he could address him."
16564,ARGUMENT.,"But he fell in the dust, and noble Achilles vaunted over him:"
16565,ARGUMENT.,
16566,ARGUMENT.,"“Hector, thou didst once suppose, when spoiling Patroclus, that thou be"
16567,ARGUMENT.,"safe, nor dreaded me, being absent. Fool! for I apart, a much braver"
16568,ARGUMENT.,"avenger of him, was left behind at the hollow ships, I who have relaxed"
16569,ARGUMENT.,"thy knees. The dogs, indeed, and birds shall dishonourably tear thee,"
16570,ARGUMENT.,but the Greeks shall perform his funeral rites.”
16571,ARGUMENT.,
16572,ARGUMENT.,"But him crest-tossing Hector, growing languid, then addressed:"
16573,ARGUMENT.,
16574,ARGUMENT.,"“I supplicate thee by thy soul, thy knees, thy parents, suffer not the"
16575,ARGUMENT.,dogs to tear me at the ships of the Greeks; but do thou indeed receive
16576,ARGUMENT.,"brass in abundance, and gold, which my father and venerable mother will"
16577,ARGUMENT.,"give thee; and send my body home, that the Trojans and wives of the"
16578,ARGUMENT.,"Trojans may make me, dead, partaker of a funeral pyre.” 708"

16591,ARGUMENT.,"my might and mind in any manner urge me myself, tearing thy raw flesh"

16593,ARGUMENT.,"there is not any one who can drive away the dogs from thy head, not"
16594,ARGUMENT.,"even if they should place ten-fold and twenty-times such ransoms,"
16595,ARGUMENT.,"bringing them hither, and even promise others; not even if Dardanian"

16600,ARGUMENT.,
16601,ARGUMENT.,"But him crest-tossing Hector, dying, addressed:"
16602,ARGUMENT.,

16650,ARGUMENT.,"“O friends, leaders and princes of the Greeks, since the gods have"
16651,ARGUMENT.,"granted us to subdue this hero, he who did as many mischiefs, as did"
16652,ARGUMENT.,not all the others together; come! let us make trial round the city

16654,ARGUMENT.,"have; whether they are about to desert the citadel, he being slain, or"
16655,ARGUMENT.,"intend to remain, Hector being no more. But why does my mind within me"

16657,ARGUMENT.,"unburied corse; and him I shall never forget, as long as I am amongst"
16658,ARGUMENT.,"the living, and my dear knees move for me; and though they forget the"
16659,ARGUMENT.,"dead in Hades, yet will I remember my beloved comrade even there. But"
16660,ARGUMENT.,"come now, ye youths of the Greeks, singing a pæan, 713 let us return to"
16661,ARGUMENT.,"the hollow ships, and let us bring him; we bear back great glory: we"
16662,ARGUMENT.,"have slain noble Hector, whom the Trojans, throughout the city,"
16663,ARGUMENT.,worshipped as a god.”
16664,ARGUMENT.,
16665,ARGUMENT.,"He spoke, and was meditating unseemly deeds against noble Hector. He"
16666,ARGUMENT.,"perforated the tendons of both his feet behind, from the heel to the"
16667,ARGUMENT.,"instep, and fastened in them leather thongs, and bound him from the"
16668,ARGUMENT.,chariot; but left his head to be trailed along. Then ascending his
16669,ARGUMENT.,"chariot, and taking up the splendid armour, he lashed (the horses) to"
16670,ARGUMENT.,"go on, and they, not unwilling, flew. But the dust arose from him while"
16671,ARGUMENT.,"trailed along, and his azure locks around approached [the ground], 714"
16672,ARGUMENT.,"and his entire head, once graceful, lay in the dust; for Jupiter had"
16673,ARGUMENT.,"then granted to his enemies, to dishonour him in his own father-land."
16674,ARGUMENT.,Thus indeed his whole head was defiled with dust; but his mother plucked
16675,ARGUMENT.,"out her hair, and cast away her shining veil, and wept very loudly,"
16676,ARGUMENT.,"having beheld her son. And his dear father groaned piteously, and all"
16677,ARGUMENT.,the people around were occupied in wailing and lamentation through the
16678,ARGUMENT.,"city; and it was very like to this, as if all Ilium, from its summit,"
16679,ARGUMENT.,were smouldering in fire. With difficulty indeed did the people detain
16680,ARGUMENT.,"the old man, indignant with grief anxious to rush out from the"
16681,ARGUMENT.,"Dardanian gates: for rolling in the mud, he was supplicating all,"

16693,ARGUMENT.,"reckless, violent man, if perchance he may respect my time of life, and"
16694,ARGUMENT.,"have compassion on my old age; for such is his father Peleus to him, he"
16695,ARGUMENT.,who begat and nurtured him a destruction to the Trojans; but
16696,ARGUMENT.,particularly to me above all has he caused sorrows. For so many
16697,ARGUMENT.,"blooming youths has he slain to me, for all of whom I do not lament so"
16698,ARGUMENT.,"much, although grieved, as for this one, Hector, keen grief for whom"
16699,ARGUMENT.,will bear me down even into Hades. 715 Would that he had died in my
16700,ARGUMENT.,"hands; for thus we should have been satisfied, weeping and lamenting,"
16701,ARGUMENT.,"both his unhappy mother who bore him, and I myself.” Thus he spoke,"
16702,ARGUMENT.,"weeping, but the citizens also groaned. But among the Trojan dames,"
16703,ARGUMENT.,Hecuba began her continued lamentation:

16711,ARGUMENT.,who received thee as a god. For assuredly thou wast a very great glory
16712,ARGUMENT.,"to them when alive now, on the contrary, death and fate possess thee.”"
16713,ARGUMENT.,
16714,ARGUMENT.,"Thus she spoke, weeping; but the wife of Hector had not yet learned"
16715,ARGUMENT.,"anything: no certain messenger going, informed her that her husband had"
16716,ARGUMENT.,remained without the gates; but she was weaving a web in a retired part
16717,ARGUMENT.,"of her lofty house; double, splendid, and was spreading on it various"
16718,ARGUMENT.,painted works. 716 And she had ordered her fair-haired attendants
16719,ARGUMENT.,"through the palace, to place a large tripod on the fire, that there"
16720,ARGUMENT.,"might be a warm bath for Hector, returning from the battle. Foolish!"
16721,ARGUMENT.,"nor knew she that, far away from baths, azure-eyed Minerva had subdued"
16722,ARGUMENT.,him by the hands of Achilles. But she heard the shriek and wailing from
16723,ARGUMENT.,"the tower, and her limbs were shaken, and the shuttle fell from her to"
16724,ARGUMENT.,the ground; and immediately she addressed her fair-haired attendants:
16725,ARGUMENT.,
16726,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 716: (return)   οικίλματα is similarly used in vi. 294.
16727,ARGUMENT.,
16728,ARGUMENT.,"“Come hither, let two follow me, that I may see what deeds have been"
16729,ARGUMENT.,"done. I heard the voice of my venerable mother-in-law, and to myself"
16730,ARGUMENT.,"the heart within my breast leaps up to my mouth, and the limbs under me"
16731,ARGUMENT.,are benumbed. Surely some evil is now near the sons of Priam. O that
16732,ARGUMENT.,"the word may be [far] from my ear! I dread lest brave Achilles, having"
16733,ARGUMENT.,"already cut off noble Hector alone from the city, may drive him towards"
16734,ARGUMENT.,"the plain, and even now have made him desist from the fatal valour"
16735,ARGUMENT.,which possessed him; for he never remained among the throng of
16736,ARGUMENT.,"warriors, but leaped out far before, yielding in his valour to none.”"
16737,ARGUMENT.,
16738,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having spoken, she rushed through the palace like unto one"
16739,ARGUMENT.,"deranged, greatly palpitating in heart; and her attendants went along"
16740,ARGUMENT.,"with her. But when she reached the tower and the crowd of men, she"
16741,ARGUMENT.,"stood looking round over the wall, and beheld him dragged before the"
16742,ARGUMENT.,city; but the fleet steeds drew him ruthlessly towards the ships of the
16743,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks. Then gloomy night veiled her over her eyes, and she fell"
16744,ARGUMENT.,"backwards, and breathed out her soul in a swoon. But from her head fell"
16745,ARGUMENT.,"the beautiful head-gear, the garland, the net, and the twisted fillet,"
16746,ARGUMENT.,and the veil which golden Venus had given to her on that day when
16747,ARGUMENT.,"crest-tossing Hector led her from the palace of Eëtion, after he had"
16748,ARGUMENT.,presented many marriage-gifts. Around her in great numbers stood her
16749,ARGUMENT.,"sisters-in-law and sisters, who supported her amongst them, seized with"
16750,ARGUMENT.,"stupor unto death. 717 But when she again revived, and her soul was"
16751,ARGUMENT.,"collected in her breast, sobbing at intervals, she spoke among the"
16752,ARGUMENT.,Trojan dames:

16756,ARGUMENT.,
16757,ARGUMENT.,"“Hector, O wretched me! then we were both born to a like fate, thou"
16758,ARGUMENT.,"indeed in Troy, in the mansion of Priam, but I in Thebe, beneath woody"
16759,ARGUMENT.,"Placus, in the palace of Eëtion; who, himself ill-fated, reared me,"
16760,ARGUMENT.,"ill-fated, being yet a little child;—would that he had not begotten me!"
16761,ARGUMENT.,"Now, however, thou goest to the mansions of Hades beneath the recesses"
16762,ARGUMENT.,"of the earth, but leavest me, in hateful grief, a widow in the"
16763,ARGUMENT.,"dwelling; and thy boy, yet such an infant, to whom thou and I"
16764,ARGUMENT.,"unfortunate gave birth; nor wilt thou be an advantage to him, O Hector,"
16765,ARGUMENT.,for thou art dead; nor he to thee. For even if he shall escape the
16766,ARGUMENT.,"mournful war of the Greeks, still will labour and hardship ever be to"
16767,ARGUMENT.,him hereafter; for others will deprive him of his fields by changing
16768,ARGUMENT.,the landmarks. But the bereaving day renders a boy destitute of his
16769,ARGUMENT.,"contemporaries; he is ever dejected, and his cheeks are bedewed with"
16770,ARGUMENT.,"tears. The boy in want shall go to the companions of his father,"
16771,ARGUMENT.,"pulling one by the cloak, another by the tunic; and some of these"
16772,ARGUMENT.,"pitying, shall present him with a very small cup; and he shall moisten"
16773,ARGUMENT.,"his lips, but not wet his palate. Him also some one, enjoying both"
16774,ARGUMENT.,"[parents], 718 shall push away from the banquet, striking him with his"
16775,ARGUMENT.,"hands, and reviling him with reproaches: ‘A murrain on thee! even thy"
16776,ARGUMENT.,father feasts not with us.’ Then shall the boy Astyanax return weeping
16777,ARGUMENT.,"to his widowed mother,—he who formerly, indeed, upon the knees of his"
16778,ARGUMENT.,"own father, ate marrow alone, and the rich fat of sheep; but when sleep"
16779,ARGUMENT.,"came upon him, and he ceased childishly crying, used to sleep on"
16780,ARGUMENT.,"couches in the arms of a nurse, in a soft bed, full as to his heart"
16781,ARGUMENT.,"with delicacies. But now, indeed, Astyanax, 719 whom the Trojans call"
16782,ARGUMENT.,by surname (because thou alone didst defend their gates and lofty walls
16783,ARGUMENT.,"for them), shall suffer many things, missing his dear father. But now"
16784,ARGUMENT.,"shall the crawling worms devour thee, naked, at the curved ships, far"
16785,ARGUMENT.,"away from thy parents, after the dogs shall have satiated themselves:"
16786,ARGUMENT.,"but thy robes, fine and graceful, woven by the hands of women, lie in"
16787,ARGUMENT.,"thy palaces. Truly all these will I consume with burning fire, being of"
16788,ARGUMENT.,"no use to thee, for thou wilt not lie on them; but let them be a glory"
16789,ARGUMENT.,[to thee] before the Trojans and the Trojan dames.”

16981,ARGUMENT.,"forests of many-rilled Ida, hastening, they cut down the towering oaks"

16997,ARGUMENT.,"covered all the dead body over with hair, which, cutting off, 733 they"

17117,ARGUMENT.,
17118,ARGUMENT.,Yet the pile of dead Patroclus burnt not. Then again noble Achilles

17121,ARGUMENT.,"out many libations with a golden goblet, he supplicated them to come,"
17122,ARGUMENT.,"that they might burn the body with fire as soon as possible, and the"
17123,ARGUMENT.,"wood might hasten to be burned. But swift Iris, hearing his prayers,"
17124,ARGUMENT.,"went as a messenger to the winds. They, indeed, together at home with"
17125,ARGUMENT.,"fierce-breathing Zephyrus, were celebrating a feast, when Iris,"
17126,ARGUMENT.,"hastening, stood upon the stone threshold. But when they beheld her"
17127,ARGUMENT.,"with their eyes, they rose up, and invited her to him, each of them."
17128,ARGUMENT.,"But she, on the contrary, refused to sit down, and spoke [this] speech:"

17133,ARGUMENT.,"Achilles now supplicates Boreas, and sonorous Zephyrus, to come, that"
17134,ARGUMENT.,"ye may kindle the pile to be consumed, on which lies Patroclus, whom"
17135,ARGUMENT.,all the Greeks bewail.”
17136,ARGUMENT.,
17137,ARGUMENT.,"She, indeed, thus having spoken, departed; but they hastened to go with"
17138,ARGUMENT.,"a great tumult, driving on the clouds before them. Immediately they"
17139,ARGUMENT.,"reached the sea, blowing, and the billow was raised up beneath their"
17140,ARGUMENT.,"sonorous blast: but they reached the very fertile Troad, and fell upon"
17141,ARGUMENT.,"the pile, and mightily resounded the fiercely-burning fire. All night,"
17142,ARGUMENT.,"indeed, did they together toss about the blaze of the pyre, shrilly"
17143,ARGUMENT.,"blowing; and all night swift Achilles, holding a double cup, poured"
17144,ARGUMENT.,"wine upon the ground, drawing it from a golden goblet, and moistened"
17145,ARGUMENT.,"the earth, invoking the manes of wretched Patroclus. And as a father"
17146,ARGUMENT.,"mourns, consuming the bones of his son, a bridegroom who, dying, has"
17147,ARGUMENT.,"afflicted his unhappy parents, so mourned Achilles, burning the bones"
17148,ARGUMENT.,"of his companion, pacing pensively beside the pile, groaning"
17149,ARGUMENT.,"continually. But when Lucifer arrived, proclaiming light over the"
17150,ARGUMENT.,"earth, after whom saffron-vested Morn is diffused over the sea, then"
17151,ARGUMENT.,"the pyre grew languid, and the flame decayed; and the Winds departed"
17152,ARGUMENT.,"again, to return home through the Thracian sea; but it (the sea)"
17153,ARGUMENT.,"groaned indeed, raging with swelling billow."
17154,ARGUMENT.,
17155,ARGUMENT.,"But Pelides, going apart 740 from the pile, reclined fatigued, and upon"

17172,ARGUMENT.,many-benched barks.”
17173,ARGUMENT.,
17174,ARGUMENT.,Thus he spoke; and they obeyed the swift-footed son of Peleus. First of
17175,ARGUMENT.,"all, indeed, they totally extinguished the pyre with dark wine, as much"
17176,ARGUMENT.,"as the fire had invaded, and the deep ashes fell in; and, weeping, they"
17177,ARGUMENT.,"collected the white bones of their mild companion into a golden vessel,"
17178,ARGUMENT.,"and a double [layer of] fat; then, laying them in the tent, they"
17179,ARGUMENT.,covered them with soft 742 linen. Next they marked out the area for the
17180,ARGUMENT.,"tomb, and laid the foundations around the pile; and immediately"
17181,ARGUMENT.,"upraised a mound of earth; and, heaping up the tomb, returned. But"
17182,ARGUMENT.,"Achilles detained the people there, and made the wide assembly sit"

17187,ARGUMENT.,"handled tripod of two-and-twenty measures, for the first; but for the"
17188,ARGUMENT.,"second he staked a mare six years old, unbroken, pregnant with a young"
17189,ARGUMENT.,"mule; for the third he staked a fireless tripod, beautiful, containing"
17190,ARGUMENT.,"four measures, yet quite untarnished; 744 for the fourth he staked two"
17191,ARGUMENT.,"talents of gold; and for the fifth he staked a double vessel, untouched"
17192,ARGUMENT.,"by the fire. Erect he stood, and spoke this speech to the Greeks:"

17246,ARGUMENT.,
17247,ARGUMENT.,"“O Antilochus, assuredly indeed both Jove and Neptune have loved thee,"
17248,ARGUMENT.,"although being young, and have taught thee all kinds of equestrian"
17249,ARGUMENT.,exercise; wherefore there is no great need to instruct thee. For thou
17250,ARGUMENT.,knowest how to turn the goals with safety; but thy horses are very slow
17251,ARGUMENT.,"to run, wherefore I think that disasters may happen. Their horses,"
17252,ARGUMENT.,"indeed, are more fleet, but they themselves know not how to manoeuvre"
17253,ARGUMENT.,"better than thou thyself. But come now, beloved one, contrive every"
17254,ARGUMENT.,"manner of contrivance in thy mind, lest the prizes by any chance escape"
17255,ARGUMENT.,"thee. By skill is the wood-cutter much better than by strength; and,"
17256,ARGUMENT.,"again, by skill the pilot directs upon the dark sea the swift ship,"
17257,ARGUMENT.,tossed about by the winds; and by skill charioteer excels charioteer.
17258,ARGUMENT.,"One man who is confident in his steeds and chariot, turns imprudently"
17259,ARGUMENT.,"hither and thither over much [ground], and his steeds wander through"
17260,ARGUMENT.,"the course, nor does he rein them in. But he, on the contrary, who is"
17261,ARGUMENT.,"acquainted with stratagem [though] driving inferior steeds, always"
17262,ARGUMENT.,"looking at the goal, turns it close, nor does it escape him in what"
17263,ARGUMENT.,manner he may first turn [the course] 746 with his leathern reins; but
17264,ARGUMENT.,"he holds on steadily, and watches the one who is before him. But I will"
17265,ARGUMENT.,"show thee the goal, easily distinguished, nor shall it escape thy"
17266,ARGUMENT.,"notice. A piece of dry wood, as much as a cubit, stands over the"
17267,ARGUMENT.,"ground, either of oak or of larch, which is not rotted by rain; and two"
17268,ARGUMENT.,"white stones are placed on either side, in the narrow part of the way;"
17269,ARGUMENT.,747 but the racecourse around is level: either it is the monument 748
17270,ARGUMENT.,"of some man long since dead, or perhaps it has been a goal in the time"
17271,ARGUMENT.,"of former men, and now swift-footed noble Achilles has appointed it the"
17272,ARGUMENT.,"goal. Approaching this very closely, drive thy chariot and horses near;"
17273,ARGUMENT.,"but incline thyself gently towards the left of them (the steeds), in"
17274,ARGUMENT.,"the well-joined chariot-seat; and, cheering on the right-hand horse,"
17275,ARGUMENT.,"apply the whip, and give him the rein with thy hands. Let thy left-hand"
17276,ARGUMENT.,"horse, however, be moved close to the goal, so that the nave of the"
17277,ARGUMENT.,"well-made wheel may appear to touch, the top [of the post]; but avoid"
17278,ARGUMENT.,"to touch upon the stone, lest thou both wound thy horses, and break thy"
17279,ARGUMENT.,"chariot in pieces, and be a joy to the others, and a disgrace to"
17280,ARGUMENT.,"thyself. But, my beloved son, mind to be on thy guard; for if at the"
17281,ARGUMENT.,"goal thou couldst pass by in the course, there will not be one who"
17282,ARGUMENT.,"could overtake thee in pursuit, nor pass thee by; not if behind he"
17283,ARGUMENT.,"drives noble Arion, the swift steed of Adrastus, 749 which was from a"
17284,ARGUMENT.,"god in race; or those of Laomedon, which, excellent, have here been"

17332,ARGUMENT.,"Then they all at once raised their lashes over their steeds, and struck"
17333,ARGUMENT.,"them with the reins, and cheered them on with words incessantly; but"
17334,ARGUMENT.,"they rapidly flew over the plain, far away from the ships, swiftly, and"
17335,ARGUMENT.,"beneath their breasts the excited dust stood up, raised like a cloud or"
17336,ARGUMENT.,a whirlwind; whilst their manes were tossed about by the breath of the
17337,ARGUMENT.,"wind. Sometimes, indeed, the chariots approached the fruitful earth,"
17338,ARGUMENT.,and at others bounded aloft; but the drivers stood erect in their
17339,ARGUMENT.,"chariots, and the heart of each of them, eager for victory, palpitated:"
17340,ARGUMENT.,"and each animated his own steeds, but they flew along, stirring up dust"
17341,ARGUMENT.,from the plain. But when now the fleet steeds were performing the last
17342,ARGUMENT.,"course, back towards the hoary deep, then appeared the excellence of"
17343,ARGUMENT.,"each, and the course was immediately extended to the horses; 751 and"
17344,ARGUMENT.,then the swift-footed steeds of the son of Pheres 752 swiftly bore him
17345,ARGUMENT.,"away. The male Trojan steeds of Diomede, however, bore [themselves]"
17346,ARGUMENT.,"next to them; nor were they at all far distant, but very near; for they"
17347,ARGUMENT.,always seemed as if about to mount into the chariot. And with their
17348,ARGUMENT.,breathing the back and broad shoulders of Eumelus were warmed; for they
17349,ARGUMENT.,"flew along, leaning their heads over him. And certainly he had either"
17350,ARGUMENT.,"passed, or made [the victory] doubtful, had not Phœbus Apollo been"
17351,ARGUMENT.,"enraged with the son of Tydeus, and accordingly shaken out of his hands"
17352,ARGUMENT.,"the shining lash. Then from the eyes of him indignant tears poured,"
17353,ARGUMENT.,"because indeed he beheld the others now going much swifter, whilst his"
17354,ARGUMENT.,"[steeds] were injured, running without a goad. Neither did Apollo,"
17355,ARGUMENT.,"fraudulently injuring Tydides, escape the notice of Minerva, but she"
17356,ARGUMENT.,"very quickly overtook the shepherd of the people, and gave him his"
17357,ARGUMENT.,"lash, and put vigour into his steeds. And to the son of Admetus, the"
17358,ARGUMENT.,"goddess, indignant, advanced, and broke for him his horse-yoke; and so"
17359,ARGUMENT.,"his mares ran on both sides out of the way, and the pole was dashed"
17360,ARGUMENT.,upon the ground. He himself was thrown from the driving-seat close by
17361,ARGUMENT.,"the wheel, and was lacerated all round in his arms, his mouth, and"
17362,ARGUMENT.,"nostrils, and his forehead was bruised near the eyebrows; but his eyes"
17363,ARGUMENT.,"were filled with tears, and his liquid voice was clogged. Then Diomede"
17364,ARGUMENT.,"passing by, directed his hollow-hoofed steeds, bounding far before the"
17365,ARGUMENT.,"others; for Minerva had put vigour into his steeds, and given him"
17366,ARGUMENT.,"glory. But after him, however, the son of Atreus, yellow-haired"
17367,ARGUMENT.,"Menelaus, drove; but Antilochus cheered on the steeds of his father:"

17378,ARGUMENT.,"quickly overtake the horses of Atrides, nor be left behind, lest Æthe,"
17379,ARGUMENT.,"being a mare, shed disgrace upon you both. Why should ye be left"
17380,ARGUMENT.,"inferior, O best [of steeds]? For thus I tell you, and it shall surely"

17382,ARGUMENT.,"shepherd of the people, but he will immediately slay you with the sharp"
17383,ARGUMENT.,"brass, if we, remiss, bear off the less worthy prize. But follow, and"
17384,ARGUMENT.,hasten as fast as possible. These things will I myself manage and look
17385,ARGUMENT.,"to, to pass him by in the narrow way; nor shall it escape me.”"
17386,ARGUMENT.,
17387,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but they, dreading the threat of their master, ran"
17388,ARGUMENT.,faster for a short time: but immediately then warlike Antilochus
17389,ARGUMENT.,"perceived the narrow of the hollow way. It was a fissure of the earth,"
17390,ARGUMENT.,"where the wintry torrent collected, had broken away [part] of the road,"
17391,ARGUMENT.,"and gullied the whole place; thither drove Menelaus, avoiding the clash"
17392,ARGUMENT.,"of wheels. But Antilochus, deviating, guided his solid-hoofed horses"
17393,ARGUMENT.,"out of the way, and turning aside, pursued him a little. But the son of"
17394,ARGUMENT.,"Atreus feared, and shouted to Antilochus:"
17395,ARGUMENT.,
17396,ARGUMENT.,"“Antilochus, rashly art thou driving thy horses; but check thy steeds"
17397,ARGUMENT.,"for the road is narrow, and thou wilt soon drive past in a wider lest"
17398,ARGUMENT.,"thou damage both [of us], running foul of [my] chariot.” Thus he spoke;"
17399,ARGUMENT.,"but Antilochus drove even much faster, urging [them] on with the lash,"
17400,ARGUMENT.,"like unto one not hearing. As far as is the cast of a quoit, hurled"
17401,ARGUMENT.,"from the shoulder, which a vigorous youth has thrown, making"
17402,ARGUMENT.,experiments of his youthful strength; so far they ran abreast; but
17403,ARGUMENT.,"those of Atrides fell back: for he himself voluntarily ceased to drive,"
17404,ARGUMENT.,"lest the solid-hoofed steeds should clash in the road, and overturn the"
17405,ARGUMENT.,"well-joined chariots, and they themselves should fall in the dust,"
17406,ARGUMENT.,"while contending for the victory. And him yellow-haired Menelaus,"
17407,ARGUMENT.,"chiding, addressed:"
17408,ARGUMENT.,
17409,ARGUMENT.,"“O Antilochus, no other mortal is more pernicious than thou. Avaunt!"
17410,ARGUMENT.,for we Greeks untruly said that thou wast prudent. Yet not even thus
17411,ARGUMENT.,"shalt thou bear away the prize without an oath.” 753 Thus saying, he"
17412,ARGUMENT.,"cheered on his steeds, and spoke to them:"
17413,ARGUMENT.,
17414,ARGUMENT.,"“Be not kept back, nor stand, grieving in your hearts: sooner will the"
17415,ARGUMENT.,feet and knees grow weary to them than to you; for they are both
17416,ARGUMENT.,deprived of vigour.”
17417,ARGUMENT.,
17418,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but they, dreading the exhortation of their master, ran"
17419,ARGUMENT.,"more fleetly, and became very near the others. But the Greeks sitting"
17420,ARGUMENT.,"in assembly, 754 beheld the steeds, and they flew along, raising dust"
17421,ARGUMENT.,"over the plain. Then first Idomeneus, leader of the Cretans,"
17422,ARGUMENT.,"distinguished the horses; for he sat outside the circus, very high up,"
17423,ARGUMENT.,"on an observatory; and hearing him, being far off, encouraging [his"
17424,ARGUMENT.,"steeds], knew him. He also perceived a remarkable steed outstripping,"
17425,ARGUMENT.,"which in every other part indeed was chesnut, but in its forehead was a"
17426,ARGUMENT.,"white round spot, like the moon. And he stood erect, and delivered this"

17434,ARGUMENT.,
17435,ARGUMENT.,"“O friends, leaders and chieftains of the Greeks, do I alone recognize"
17436,ARGUMENT.,"the horses, or do ye also? Different steeds indeed appear to me to be"
17437,ARGUMENT.,"foremost, and there seems a different charioteer; but those [mares]"
17438,ARGUMENT.,"which hitherto were successful, are probably hurt upon the plain"
17439,ARGUMENT.,"somewhere: for surely I first saw them turning round the goal, but now"
17440,ARGUMENT.,"I can no longer see them, although my eyes survey the Trojan plain as I"
17441,ARGUMENT.,"gaze around. Surely the reins have fled the charioteer, and he could"
17442,ARGUMENT.,"not rein well round the goal, and did not succeed in turning. There I"
17443,ARGUMENT.,"imagine he fell out, and at the same time broke his chariot, whilst"
17444,ARGUMENT.,"they (the mares) bolted, when fury seized their mind. But do ye also,"
17445,ARGUMENT.,"standing up, look, for I cannot well distinguish; it appears to me to"
17446,ARGUMENT.,"be an Ætolian hero by birth, and [who] rules amongst the Argives, the"
17447,ARGUMENT.,"son of horse-breaking Tydeus, gallant Diomede.”"
17448,ARGUMENT.,
17449,ARGUMENT.,"But him swift Ajax, the son of Oïleus, bitterly reproached:"

17481,ARGUMENT.,
17482,ARGUMENT.,"“No longer now, O Ajax and Idomeneus, hold altercation in evil, angry"

17484,ARGUMENT.,"should do such things; but, sitting down in the circus, look towards"
17485,ARGUMENT.,"the steeds, which themselves will soon arrive, contending for victory;"
17486,ARGUMENT.,"and then will ye know, each of you, the horses of the Greeks, which are"
17487,ARGUMENT.,"second, and which first.”"
17488,ARGUMENT.,
17489,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but the son of Tydeus came very near, pursuing, and"
17490,ARGUMENT.,always drove on [his horses] with the lash across the shoulders; whilst
17491,ARGUMENT.,"the steeds were raised up aloft into the air, quickly completing their"
17492,ARGUMENT.,"course, and the drops of dust kept always bespattering their"
17493,ARGUMENT.,"charioteer. The chariot, adorned with gold and tin, rolled on close to"
17494,ARGUMENT.,the swift-footed steeds; nor was there a deep trace of the tires behind
17495,ARGUMENT.,"in the fine dust, but they, hastening, flew. But he stood in the midst"
17496,ARGUMENT.,"of the circus, and much perspiration exuded from the steeds, from their"
17497,ARGUMENT.,necks and chest to the ground. But he himself leaped to the ground from
17498,ARGUMENT.,"his all-shining chariot, and rested his scourge against the yoke; nor"
17499,ARGUMENT.,"was gallant Sthenelus dilatory, but he eagerly seized the prize, and"
17500,ARGUMENT.,"gave the woman to his magnanimous companions to escort, and the handled"
17501,ARGUMENT.,tripod to bear away; whilst he himself unyoked the steeds.
17502,ARGUMENT.,
17503,ARGUMENT.,"Next to him Nelcian Antilochus drove his steeds, outstripping Menelaus"
17504,ARGUMENT.,"by stratagem, not indeed by speed. Yet even thus Menelaus drove his"
17505,ARGUMENT.,"swift horses near; but as far as a horse is distant from the wheel,"
17506,ARGUMENT.,"which, exerting its speed with the chariot, draws its master through"
17507,ARGUMENT.,"the plain, and the extreme hairs of its tail touch the wheel-tire, but"
17508,ARGUMENT.,"it rolls very near, nor is there much space between, while it runs over"
17509,ARGUMENT.,the vast plain; so far was illustrious Menelaus left behind by
17510,ARGUMENT.,Antilochus: although at first he was left behind as much as the cast of
17511,ARGUMENT.,"a quoit, yet he quickly overtook him; for the doughty strength of"
17512,ARGUMENT.,"Agamemnon’s mare, the beautiful-maned Æthe, was increased. And if the"
17513,ARGUMENT.,"course had been still longer to both, he would surely have passed him"
17514,ARGUMENT.,"by, nor left it doubtful. Meriones again, the good attendant of"
17515,ARGUMENT.,"Idomeneus, was left behind a spear’s throw by the illustrious Menelaus,"
17516,ARGUMENT.,"for his fair-maned steeds were the slowest, and he himself least"
17517,ARGUMENT.,skilful in driving a chariot in the contest. But the son of Admetus
17518,ARGUMENT.,"came last of others, dragging his beauteous chariot, driving his steeds"
17519,ARGUMENT.,"before him. But him swift-footed, noble Achilles seeing, pitied, and"
17520,ARGUMENT.,"standing amongst the Greeks, spoke [to him] winged words:"
17521,ARGUMENT.,
17522,ARGUMENT.,"“The best man drives his solid-hoofed steeds the last. But come, let us"
17523,ARGUMENT.,"give him, as is right, the second prize; and let the son of Tydeus bear"
17524,ARGUMENT.,away the first.”
17525,ARGUMENT.,
17526,ARGUMENT.,Thus he spoke; and all approved as he ordered. And now truly he had
17527,ARGUMENT.,"given the mare to him (for the Greeks approved it), had not Antilochus,"
17528,ARGUMENT.,"the son of magnanimous Nestor, rising up, replied to Achilles, the son"
17529,ARGUMENT.,"of Peleus, on the question of justice: 758"
17530,ARGUMENT.,
17531,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 758: (return)  Not “with justice,” as the translators,"

17534,ARGUMENT.,
17535,ARGUMENT.,"“Ο Achilles, I shall be very indignant with thee, if thou fulfillest"
17536,ARGUMENT.,"this promise; for thou art about to deprive me of my reward,"
17537,ARGUMENT.,"considering these things, that his chariot and fleet steeds were"
17538,ARGUMENT.,"injured, he himself being skilful; but he should have prayed to the"
17539,ARGUMENT.,"immortals, then would he by no means have come up driving the last. But"
17540,ARGUMENT.,"if thou pitiest him, and it be agreeable to thy mind, thou hast much"
17541,ARGUMENT.,"gold and brass in thy tent, and cattle and maidens, and solid-hoofed"
17542,ARGUMENT.,"steeds are thine. Taking from these, give him afterwards even a greater"
17543,ARGUMENT.,"reward, or even now forthwith, that the Greeks may applaud thee. This,"
17544,ARGUMENT.,"however, I will not resign, but let him of the warriors strive for her,"
17545,ARGUMENT.,whoever wishes to contend with me in strength of hands.”
17546,ARGUMENT.,
17547,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; and swift-footed, noble Achilles smiled, favouring"
17548,ARGUMENT.,"Antilochus, for he was a dear companion to him; and, answering,"
17549,ARGUMENT.,addressed to him winged words:
17550,ARGUMENT.,
17551,ARGUMENT.,"“O Antilochus, since thou now biddest me give something else to Eumelus"
17552,ARGUMENT.,"from my house, this will I indeed accomplish. I will give him the"
17553,ARGUMENT.,"corslet which I took from Asteropæus, brazen, around which there is"
17554,ARGUMENT.,entwined a rim of shining tin; and it is of great value.”
17555,ARGUMENT.,
17556,ARGUMENT.,"He spoke; and ordered his dear comrade, Automedon, to bear it from the"
17557,ARGUMENT.,tent: and he went and brought it to him; then he placed it in the hands
17558,ARGUMENT.,"of Eumelus, and he received it rejoicing. But Menelaus also arose"
17559,ARGUMENT.,"amongst them, grieving in his mind, vehemently enraged with Antilochus."
17560,ARGUMENT.,"Then a herald placed the sceptre in his hands, and ordered the Greeks"
17561,ARGUMENT.,to be silent; and then the godlike hero spoke:
17562,ARGUMENT.,
17563,ARGUMENT.,"“O Antilochus, hitherto prudent, what hast thou done? Thou hast"
17564,ARGUMENT.,"disgraced my skill, and injured my steeds, driving thine before them,"
17565,ARGUMENT.,"which indeed are greatly inferior. But come, ye leaders and chiefs of"
17566,ARGUMENT.,"the Greeks, judge between us both, and not for favour; lest some one of"
17567,ARGUMENT.,the brazen-mailed Greeks should say: ‘Menelaus having overcome
17568,ARGUMENT.,"Antilochus by falsehoods, came off, leading the mare [as a prize], for"
17569,ARGUMENT.,"his steeds were very inferior, but he himself superior in skill and"
17570,ARGUMENT.,"strength.’ 759 But come, I myself will decide, and I think that no"
17571,ARGUMENT.,"other of the Greeks will blame me, for it will be just.”"
17572,ARGUMENT.,
17573,ARGUMENT.,"“O Antilochus, nurtured of Jove, come hither, I pray, as it is just,"
17574,ARGUMENT.,"standing before thy horses and chariot, and holding in thy hands the"
17575,ARGUMENT.,"pliant lash with which thou didst formerly drive, touching thy steeds,"
17576,ARGUMENT.,"swear by earth-encompassing Neptune, that thou didst not willingly"
17577,ARGUMENT.,impede my chariot by stratagem.” 760

17582,ARGUMENT.,
17583,ARGUMENT.,But him prudent Antilochus in turn answered:
17584,ARGUMENT.,
17585,ARGUMENT.,"“Have patience now, since I am much younger than thou, O king Menelaus,"
17586,ARGUMENT.,and thou art older and superior. Thou knowest of what sort are the
17587,ARGUMENT.,"errors of a youth; for his mind is indeed more volatile, and his"
17588,ARGUMENT.,"counsel weak. Therefore let thy heart endure, and I myself will give"
17589,ARGUMENT.,thee the steed which I have received. And if indeed thou demandest
17590,ARGUMENT.,"anything else greater from my house, I should be willing to give it"
17591,ARGUMENT.,"immediately rather than fall for ever, Ο Jove-nurtured, from thy good"
17592,ARGUMENT.,"opinion, and be sinful towards the gods.”"
17593,ARGUMENT.,
17594,ARGUMENT.,"He spoke; and the son of magnanimous Nestor, leading the mare, placed"
17595,ARGUMENT.,it in the hands of Menelaus; but his 761 mind was cheered 762 as the
17596,ARGUMENT.,"dew [is diffused] over the ears of growing corn, when the fields are"
17597,ARGUMENT.,"bristling. Thus indeed, Ο Menelaus, was thy soul in thy breast cheered;"
17598,ARGUMENT.,"and speaking, he addressed to him winged words:"

17600,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 761: (return)  _I.e._ Menelaus.
17601,ARGUMENT.,
17602,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 762: (return)  Or softened, melted. See Heyne."
17603,ARGUMENT.,
17604,ARGUMENT.,"“Antilochus, now indeed will I cease being enraged with thee, for"
17605,ARGUMENT.,formerly thou wert neither foolish nor volatile; though now youth has
17606,ARGUMENT.,subdued reason. Avoid a second time overreaching thy superiors; for not
17607,ARGUMENT.,another man of the Greeks would have easily appeased me. But thou hast
17608,ARGUMENT.,"already suffered much, and accomplished many deeds, as well as thy good"
17609,ARGUMENT.,"father and brother, for my sake: therefore will I be persuaded by thee,"
17610,ARGUMENT.,"supplicating, and will give the mare also, although being mine; that"
17611,ARGUMENT.,these too may perceive that my soul is never overbearing or
17612,ARGUMENT.,unrelenting.”
17613,ARGUMENT.,
17614,ARGUMENT.,"He spoke, and gave the steed to Noëmon, the comrade of Antilochus, to"
17615,ARGUMENT.,lead away; and then he received the shining goblet [himself]. But
17616,ARGUMENT.,"Meriones, the fourth, took up the two talents of gold, in which order"
17617,ARGUMENT.,"he drove; but the fifth prize was left, 763 which Achilles, bearing"
17618,ARGUMENT.,"through the assembly of the Greeks, gave to Nestor, and standing by"
17619,ARGUMENT.,"him, said:"
17620,ARGUMENT.,
17621,ARGUMENT.,"“Receive now, and let this be a keepsake to thee, a memorial of the"
17622,ARGUMENT.,burial of Patroclus; for never more shalt thou behold him among the
17623,ARGUMENT.,Greeks. I give this prize to thee even thus; 764 for thou indeed wilt
17624,ARGUMENT.,"not fight with the cæstus, nor wrestle, nor engage in the contest of"
17625,ARGUMENT.,"hurling the javelin, nor run on the feet, for grievous old age now"
17626,ARGUMENT.,oppresses thee.”

17633,ARGUMENT.,
17634,ARGUMENT.,"Thus speaking, he placed it in his hands; but he rejoicing, accepted"
17635,ARGUMENT.,"it, and addressing him, spoke in winged words:"
17636,ARGUMENT.,
17637,ARGUMENT.,"“Assuredly, O my son, thou hast spoken all these things aright; for no"
17638,ARGUMENT.,"longer are my limbs firm, my friend, nor my feet, nor yet do my hands"
17639,ARGUMENT.,"move pliant on each side from my shoulders. Would that I were as young,"
17640,ARGUMENT.,"and my strength was firm to me, as when the Epeans buried king"
17641,ARGUMENT.,"Amarynceus at Byprasium, and his sons staked the prizes of the king."
17642,ARGUMENT.,"There no man was equal to me, neither of the Epeans, nor of the Pelians"
17643,ARGUMENT.,"themselves, nor of the magnanimous Ætolians. In the cæstus I conquered"
17644,ARGUMENT.,"Clytomedes, the son of Enops; and in wrestling, Ancæus, the Pleuronian,"
17645,ARGUMENT.,"who rose up against me; and on foot I outstripped Iphiclus, though"
17646,ARGUMENT.,being excellent; and with the spear hurled beyond Phyleus and
17647,ARGUMENT.,"Polydorus. The two sons of Actor drove by me by their steeds only,"
17648,ARGUMENT.,"exceeding me in number, envying me the victory, for the greatest"
17649,ARGUMENT.,rewards were left for that contest. But they were two; the one indeed
17650,ARGUMENT.,"steadily directed the reins, whilst the other urged on with the lash."
17651,ARGUMENT.,"Thus I formerly was, but now let younger men undertake such deeds, as"
17652,ARGUMENT.,"it becomes me to obey sad old age, though I then excelled amongst"
17653,ARGUMENT.,"heroes. But go, and celebrate thy comrade’s obsequies with games. This,"
17654,ARGUMENT.,"indeed, I willingly accept, and my soul rejoices that thou art ever"
17655,ARGUMENT.,"mindful of me; nor am I forgotten by thee, with what honour it becomes"
17656,ARGUMENT.,me to be honoured among the Greeks. And for these things may the gods
17657,ARGUMENT.,give thee a proper return.”
17658,ARGUMENT.,
17659,ARGUMENT.,Thus he spoke; but the son of Peleus went through the great assemblage
17660,ARGUMENT.,"of the Greeks, when he had heard all the praise of Nestor. Then he"
17661,ARGUMENT.,"proposed prizes for a laborious boxing-match. 765 Leading a mule,"
17662,ARGUMENT.,"patient of toil, six years old, unbroken, which is most difficult to be"
17663,ARGUMENT.,"tamed, he tied it in the circus; and for the conquered again he staked"
17664,ARGUMENT.,"a two-handled cup: then he stood up, and spoke amongst the Greeks:"
17665,ARGUMENT.,
17666,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 765: (return)  Cf. Virg. Æn. v. 365.
17667,ARGUMENT.,
17668,ARGUMENT.,"“O ye sons of Atreus, and other well-greaved Greeks, we invite two men,"
17669,ARGUMENT.,"who are very expert, raising their hands aloft, to strike for these"
17670,ARGUMENT.,"with the fist. But to whom Apollo indeed may give victory, and all the"
17671,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks approve, leading away the mule, patient of labour, let him"
17672,ARGUMENT.,conduct it to his tent; but the vanquished shall bear away a double
17673,ARGUMENT.,cup.”
17674,ARGUMENT.,
17675,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; and immediately arose a man brave and great, skilled in"
17676,ARGUMENT.,"the art of boxing, Epëus, son of Panopeus; and grasping the"
17677,ARGUMENT.,"patient-toiling mule, said:"
17678,ARGUMENT.,
17679,ARGUMENT.,"“Let him draw near, whosoever will bear away the double cup; but I"
17680,ARGUMENT.,"think that no other of the Greeks having conquered in boxing, will lead"
17681,ARGUMENT.,away the mule; for I boast myself to be the best man. Is it not enough
17682,ARGUMENT.,that I am inferior in battle? 766 For it is by no means possible for a
17683,ARGUMENT.,"man to be skilled in every work. For thus I tell you, and it shall be"
17684,ARGUMENT.,"accomplished, I will utterly fracture his body, and also break his"
17685,ARGUMENT.,"bones. And let his friends remain here assembled, who may carry him"
17686,ARGUMENT.,away vanquished by my hands.”

17690,ARGUMENT.,
17691,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but they were all mute, in silence. But Euryalus alone"
17692,ARGUMENT.,"stood up against him, a godlike hero, son of king Mecisteus, a"
17693,ARGUMENT.,"descendant of Talaïon, who formerly came to Thebes to the funeral of"
17694,ARGUMENT.,"the deceased Œdipus, and there vanquished all the Cadmeans. About him"
17695,ARGUMENT.,"the spear-renowned son of Tydeus was busied, encouraging him with"
17696,ARGUMENT.,"words, for he greatly wished victory to him. And first he threw around"
17697,ARGUMENT.,"him his girdle, and then gave him the well-cut thongs [made of the"
17698,ARGUMENT.,"hide] of a rustic ox. But they twain, having girded themselves,"
17699,ARGUMENT.,"proceeded into the middle of the circus, and both at the same time"
17700,ARGUMENT.,"engaged, with their strong hands opposite, raising [them up], and their"
17701,ARGUMENT.,"heavy hands were mingled. Then a horrid crashing of jaws ensued, and"
17702,ARGUMENT.,the sweat flowed on all sides from their limbs. Then noble Epëus rushed
17703,ARGUMENT.,"in, and smote him upon the cheek, while looking round, nor could he"
17704,ARGUMENT.,"stand any longer; but his fair limbs tottered under him. And as when,"
17705,ARGUMENT.,"from beneath the surface, rippled 767 by the north wind, a fish leaps"
17706,ARGUMENT.,"out upon the weedy shore, and the dark billow covers it, so he,"
17707,ARGUMENT.,"stricken, sprang up. But magnanimous Epëus, taking [him] in his hands,"
17708,ARGUMENT.,"lifted him up; and his dear comrades stood around, who conducted him"
17709,ARGUMENT.,"through the circus on tottering feet, spitting out clotted gore, [and]"
17710,ARGUMENT.,"drooping his head on each side; and then, leading, placed him among"
17711,ARGUMENT.,"them, insensible, while they, departing, received the double cup."
17712,ARGUMENT.,
17713,ARGUMENT.,But the son of Peleus quickly staked other third prizes for laborious
17714,ARGUMENT.,"wrestling, exhibiting [them] to the Greeks; for the conqueror, indeed,"
17715,ARGUMENT.,"a large tripod, ready for the fire, 768 which the Greeks estimated"
17716,ARGUMENT.,amongst themselves at twelve oxen; and for the conquered person he
17717,ARGUMENT.,"placed a female in the midst. She understood various works, and they"
17718,ARGUMENT.,"reckoned her at four oxen. But he stood up, and spoke this speech among"
17719,ARGUMENT.,the Greeks:
17720,ARGUMENT.,
17721,ARGUMENT.,"“Arise, ye who will make trial of this contest.” Thus he spoke; but"
17722,ARGUMENT.,"then arose mighty Telamonian Ajax, and wise Ulysses stood up, skilled"
17723,ARGUMENT.,"in stratagems. But these two, having girded themselves, advanced into"
17724,ARGUMENT.,"the midst of the circus, and grasped each other’s arms with their"
17725,ARGUMENT.,"strong hands, like the rafters 769 of a lofty dome, which a renowned"
17726,ARGUMENT.,"architect has fitted, guarding off the violence of the winds. Then"
17727,ARGUMENT.,"their backs creaked, forcibly dragged by their powerful hands, and the"
17728,ARGUMENT.,"copious 770 sweat poured down; and thick welds, purple with blood,"
17729,ARGUMENT.,arose upon their sides and shoulders. Yet always eagerly they sought
17730,ARGUMENT.,"desired victory, for the sake of the well-made tripod. Neither could"
17731,ARGUMENT.,"Ulysses trip, nor throw him to the ground, nor could Ajax him, for the"
17732,ARGUMENT.,valiant might of Ulysses hindered him. But when at length they were
17733,ARGUMENT.,"wearying the well-greaved Greeks, then mighty Telamonian Ajax addressed"
17734,ARGUMENT.,him:

17747,ARGUMENT.,"“Ο most noble son of Laërtes, Ulysses of many wiles, either lift up me,"
17748,ARGUMENT.,"or I thee, and all these things will be a care to Jove.”"
17749,ARGUMENT.,
17750,ARGUMENT.,"So saying, he lifted him up: but yet was not Ulysses unmindful of a"
17751,ARGUMENT.,"stratagem. Aiming at his ham, he struck him behind, and relaxed his"
17752,ARGUMENT.,"limbs, and threw him on his back; but Ulysses fell upon his breast;"
17753,ARGUMENT.,"then the people admiring gazed, and were stupified. Next noble,"
17754,ARGUMENT.,"much-enduring Ulysses, lifted him in turn, and moved him a little from"
17755,ARGUMENT.,"the ground, nor did he lift him up completely; but he bent his knee;"
17756,ARGUMENT.,"and both fell upon the ground near to each other, and were defiled with"
17757,ARGUMENT.,"dust. And, getting up, they had surely wrestled for the third time, had"
17758,ARGUMENT.,not Achilles himself stood up and restrained them:
17759,ARGUMENT.,
17760,ARGUMENT.,"“No longer contend, nor exhaust yourselves with evils; for there is"
17761,ARGUMENT.,"victory to both: so depart, receiving equal rewards, in order that the"
17762,ARGUMENT.,other Greeks also may contend.” Thus he spoke; but they indeed heard
17763,ARGUMENT.,"him willingly, and obeyed; and, wiping off the dust, put on their"
17764,ARGUMENT.,tunics. But the son of Peleus immediately staked other rewards of
17765,ARGUMENT.,"swiftness, a wrought silver cup, which contained, indeed, six measures,"
17766,ARGUMENT.,"but in beauty much excelled [all] upon the whole earth, for the"
17767,ARGUMENT.,"ingenious Sidonians had wrought it cunningly, and Phœnician men had"
17768,ARGUMENT.,"carried it over the shadowy sea, and exposed it for sale in the"
17769,ARGUMENT.,"harbours, and presented it as a gift to Thoas. Euneus, son of Jason,"
17770,ARGUMENT.,"however, had given it to the hero Patroclus, as a ransom for Lycaon,"
17771,ARGUMENT.,"son of Priam. This also Achilles offered as a new prize, to be"
17772,ARGUMENT.,"contended for, in honour of his companion, whoever should be the"
17773,ARGUMENT.,"nimblest on swift feet; for the second, again, he proposed an ox, large"
17774,ARGUMENT.,and luxuriant in fat; and for the last he staked half a talent of gold.
17775,ARGUMENT.,"But he stood upright, and spoke amongst the Greeks:"
17776,ARGUMENT.,
17777,ARGUMENT.,"“Arise, ye who will make trial of this contest also.” Thus he spoke;"
17778,ARGUMENT.,"and immediately swift Ajax, son of Oïleus, arose, and much-enduring"
17779,ARGUMENT.,"Ulysses; and after them Antilochus, son of Nestor; for he, indeed,"
17780,ARGUMENT.,"excelled all the youths in fleetness. But they stood in order, and"
17781,ARGUMENT.,Achilles pointed out the goal; and their course was stretched out from
17782,ARGUMENT.,the goal. 771 Then swiftly leaped forth the son of Oïleus; but very
17783,ARGUMENT.,close after him rushed noble Ulysses; as when a shuttle is at the
17784,ARGUMENT.,"breast of a well-girdled dame, which she throws very skilfully with her"
17785,ARGUMENT.,"hands, drawing out the woof, [and inserting them] into the warp, and"
17786,ARGUMENT.,holds it near her breast: so ran Ulysses near him; and with his feet
17787,ARGUMENT.,"trod on his footsteps behind, before the dust was shed over them. But"
17788,ARGUMENT.,"noble Ulysses, constantly running swiftly, exhaled his breath upon his"
17789,ARGUMENT.,"head; and all the Greeks shouted to him, eager for victory, and"
17790,ARGUMENT.,"encouraged him, hastening rapidly. But when they were now completing"
17791,ARGUMENT.,"their last course, Ulysses forthwith prayed in his mind to azure-eyed"
17792,ARGUMENT.,Minerva:

17794,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 771: (return)  See Kennedy, and on the race of the δίαυλος,"
17795,ARGUMENT.,Smith’s Dict. of Antiquities.
17796,ARGUMENT.,
17797,ARGUMENT.,"“Hear, O goddess, come a propitious assistant to my feet.” Thus he"
17798,ARGUMENT.,"spoke, praying; but Pallas Minerva heard him; and she made his limbs"
17799,ARGUMENT.,"nimble, his feet and his hands above. But when they were just about to"
17800,ARGUMENT.,"fly in upon the prize, then Ajax slipped, while running (for Minerva"
17801,ARGUMENT.,"did the mischief), where the dung of the deep-lowing slaughtered oxen"
17802,ARGUMENT.,"was around, which swift-footed Achilles had slain in honour of"
17803,ARGUMENT.,"Patroclus. Then much-enduring, noble Ulysses took up the goblet, as he"
17804,ARGUMENT.,came running the first; and illustrious Ajax received the ox. But he
17805,ARGUMENT.,"stood, holding the horn of the rustic ox in his hands; and, spitting"
17806,ARGUMENT.,"out the dung, spoke amongst the Greeks:"
17807,ARGUMENT.,
17808,ARGUMENT.,"“Alas! surely a goddess injured my feet, who ever of old stands by"
17809,ARGUMENT.,"Ulysses as a mother, and assists him.”"
17810,ARGUMENT.,
17811,ARGUMENT.,Thus he spoke; and they all then laughed heartily at him. But
17812,ARGUMENT.,"Antilochus next bore away the last prize, smiling, and spoke among the"
17813,ARGUMENT.,Greeks:
17814,ARGUMENT.,
17815,ARGUMENT.,"“I will tell you all, my friends, though now knowing it, that even"
17816,ARGUMENT.,"still the immortals honour the aged. For Ajax, indeed, is a little"
17817,ARGUMENT.,"older than I am: but he is of a former generation, and former men; and"
17818,ARGUMENT.,"they say that he is of crude old age, and it is difficult for the"
17819,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks to contend in swiftness with him, except for Achilles.”"
17820,ARGUMENT.,
17821,ARGUMENT.,Thus he spoke; and praised the swift-footed son of Peleus. But
17822,ARGUMENT.,"Achilles, answering, addressed him with words:"
17823,ARGUMENT.,
17824,ARGUMENT.,"“Thy praise, O Antilochus, shall not be spoken in vain, but for thee I"
17825,ARGUMENT.,will add half a talent of gold.”
17826,ARGUMENT.,
17827,ARGUMENT.,"So saying, he placed it in his hands; and he, rejoicing, received it."
17828,ARGUMENT.,"But the son of Peleus, bearing into the circus, laid down a long spear,"
17829,ARGUMENT.,"and a shield, and helmet, the arms of Sarpedon, which Patroclus had"
17830,ARGUMENT.,"stripped him of; and stood upright, and spoke amongst the Greeks:"
17831,ARGUMENT.,
17832,ARGUMENT.,"“We invite two warriors, whoever are bravest, having put; on these"
17833,ARGUMENT.,"arms, [and] seizing the flesh-rending brass, to make trial of each"
17834,ARGUMENT.,other before the host for these. Whoever shall be the first to wound
17835,ARGUMENT.,"the fair flesh, and touch the entrails through the armour and black"
17836,ARGUMENT.,"blood, to him, indeed, will I give this silver-studded, beautiful"
17837,ARGUMENT.,"Thracian sword, which I formerly took from Asteropæus. But let both"
17838,ARGUMENT.,"bear away these arms in common, and before them I will place a splendid"
17839,ARGUMENT.,banquet in my tents.”
17840,ARGUMENT.,
17841,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but then arose mighty Telamonian Ajax, and the son of"
17842,ARGUMENT.,"Tydeus, valiant Diomede rose up. But they, after they had armed apart"
17843,ARGUMENT.,"on either side from the ground, both came together into the midst,"
17844,ARGUMENT.,"eager to fight, looking dreadfully; and stupor possessed all the"
17845,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks. But when approaching each other, they were near, thrice indeed"
17846,ARGUMENT.,"they rushed on, and thrice made the attack hand to hand. Then Ajax,"
17847,ARGUMENT.,"indeed, pierced through his shield, equal on all sides, nor reached the"
17848,ARGUMENT.,flesh; for the corslet inside protected him. But next the son of
17849,ARGUMENT.,"Tydeus, with the point of his shining spear, endeavoured to reach the"
17850,ARGUMENT.,"neck, over his great shield. And then, indeed, the Greeks, fearing for"
17851,ARGUMENT.,"Ajax, desired them, ceasing, to take up equal rewards. The hero,"
17852,ARGUMENT.,"however, gave the great sword to Diomede, bearing it both with the"
17853,ARGUMENT.,sheath and the well-cut belt.
17854,ARGUMENT.,
17855,ARGUMENT.,"Then the son of Peleus deposited a rudely-molten mass of iron, which"
17856,ARGUMENT.,"the great might of Eëtion used formerly to hurl. But when swift-footed,"
17857,ARGUMENT.,"noble Achilles slew him, he brought this also, with other possessions,"
17858,ARGUMENT.,"in his ships. Then he stood up, and spoke amongst the Greeks:"
17859,ARGUMENT.,
17860,ARGUMENT.,"“Arise, you who will make trial of this contest also. Even if his rich"
17861,ARGUMENT.,"fields be of very far and wide extent, using this he will have it even"
17862,ARGUMENT.,for five revolving years; for indeed neither will his shepherd nor his
17863,ARGUMENT.,"ploughman go into the city wanting iron, but [this] will furnish it.”"
17864,ARGUMENT.,
17865,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; then up arose warlike Polypœtes, and the valiant might"
17866,ARGUMENT.,"of godlike Leonteus arose; also Telamonian Ajax, and noble Epëus arose."
17867,ARGUMENT.,"Then they stood in order; but noble Epëus seized the mass, and,"
17868,ARGUMENT.,"whirling it round, threw it; but all the Greeks laughed at him. Next"
17869,ARGUMENT.,"Leonteus, a branch of Mars, threw second; but third, mighty Telamonian"
17870,ARGUMENT.,"Ajax hurled with his strong hand, and cast beyond the marks of all. But"
17871,ARGUMENT.,"when now warlike Polypœtes had seized the mass, as far as a"
17872,ARGUMENT.,"cow-herdsman throws his crook, which, whirled around, flies through the"
17873,ARGUMENT.,"herds of oxen, so far, through the whole stadium, did he cast beyond;"
17874,ARGUMENT.,"but they shouted aloud; and the companions of brave Polypœtes, rising"
17875,ARGUMENT.,"up, bore away the prize of the king to the hollow ships."
17876,ARGUMENT.,
17877,ARGUMENT.,"Next, for the archers, he staked iron fit for making arrows, 772 and"
17878,ARGUMENT.,"laid down ten battle-axes, and also ten demi-axes. He also set upright"
17879,ARGUMENT.,"the mast of an azure-prowed vessel, afar upon the sands; from [this] he"
17880,ARGUMENT.,"fastened a timid dove by a slender cord, by the foot, at which he"
17881,ARGUMENT.,ordered [them] to shoot:

17884,ARGUMENT.,
17885,ARGUMENT.,"“Whosoever indeed shall strike the timid dove, taking up all the"

17887,ARGUMENT.,"cord, missing the bird (for he is inferior), let him bear off the"
17888,ARGUMENT.,demi-axes.”
17889,ARGUMENT.,
17890,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but then up rose the might of king Teucer, and up rose"
17891,ARGUMENT.,"Meriones, the active attendant of Idomeneus; and taking the lots, they"
17892,ARGUMENT.,shook them in a brazen helmet. But Teucer was appointed first by lot;
17893,ARGUMENT.,"and straightway he shot an arrow strenuously, nor did he vow to"
17894,ARGUMENT.,sacrifice a celebrated hecatomb of firstling lambs to king [Apollo]. He
17895,ARGUMENT.,"missed the bird indeed, because Apollo envied him this, but he hit the"
17896,ARGUMENT.,"string with which the bird was fastened, close to its foot; and the"
17897,ARGUMENT.,bitter arrow cut the cord quite through. Then indeed the bird ascended
17898,ARGUMENT.,"towards heaven, but the cord was sent down towards the earth: and the"
17899,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks shouted applause. But Meriones, hastening, snatched the bow from"
17900,ARGUMENT.,"his hand; and now held the arrow for a long time, as he had directed"
17901,ARGUMENT.,it; and immediately vowed to sacrifice to far-darting Apollo a noble
17902,ARGUMENT.,hecatomb of firstling lambs. But he saw the timid dove on high beneath
17903,ARGUMENT.,"the clouds, which, as she was turning round, he hit in the middle under"
17904,ARGUMENT.,"the wing, and the arrow pierced quite through. And it indeed again was"
17905,ARGUMENT.,"fixed in the ground at the foot of Meriones: but the bird, alighting"
17906,ARGUMENT.,"upon the mast of the azure-beaked galley, drooped its neck, and its"
17907,ARGUMENT.,close wings were at the same time expanded. And swift its soul flitted
17908,ARGUMENT.,"from its members, and it fell far from [the mast]; but the people"
17909,ARGUMENT.,"wondering, beheld, and were stupified. Then Meriones took up all the"
17910,ARGUMENT.,"ten battle-axes, and Teucer carried off the demi-axes to the hollow"
17911,ARGUMENT.,barks.
17912,ARGUMENT.,
17913,ARGUMENT.,"Then the son of Peleus indeed, bearing it into the circus, staked a"
17914,ARGUMENT.,"long spear, and also a caldron, untouched by fire, worth an ox, adorned"
17915,ARGUMENT.,with flowers; and immediately the spearmen arose. The son of Atreus
17916,ARGUMENT.,"rose up, wide-ruling Agamemnon, and Meriones, the expert attendant of"
17917,ARGUMENT.,"Idomeneus; whom also swift-footed, noble Achilles addressed:"
17918,ARGUMENT.,
17919,ARGUMENT.,"“O son of Atreus, for we know how much thou dost surpass all, as well"
17920,ARGUMENT.,"as how much thou excellest in strength and in the javelin, wherefore"
17921,ARGUMENT.,"thou indeed mayest repair to the hollow barks, possessing this reward;"
17922,ARGUMENT.,"but let us give the spear to the hero Meriones, if, truly, thou dost"
17923,ARGUMENT.,thus wish it in thy mind; for I on my part advise it.”
17924,ARGUMENT.,
17925,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; nor did the king of men, Agamemnon, disobey; but he gave"
17926,ARGUMENT.,the brazen spear to Meriones; and the hero himself gave the very
17927,ARGUMENT.,splendid prize to the herald Talthybius.

17948,ARGUMENT.,"there, longing for the vigour and valiant might of Patroclus. And"
17949,ARGUMENT.,"whatever things he had accomplished with him, and hardships he had"
17950,ARGUMENT.,"suffered, both [encountering] the battles of heroes, and measuring the"
17951,ARGUMENT.,"grievous waves, remembering these things, he shed the warm tear, lying"
17952,ARGUMENT.,"at one time upon his sides, 773 at others again on his back, and at"
17953,ARGUMENT.,"other times on his face; but again starting up, he wandered about in"
17954,ARGUMENT.,"sadness along the shore of the sea; nor did Morn, appearing over the"
17955,ARGUMENT.,"sea and the shores, escape his notice. But he, when he had harnessed"
17956,ARGUMENT.,"his fleet steeds to his chariot, bound Hector to be dragged after his"
17957,ARGUMENT.,chariot; and having drawn him thrice around the tomb of the dead son of
17958,ARGUMENT.,"Menœtius, again rested in his tent; and left him there, having"
17959,ARGUMENT.,stretched him on his face in the dust. But Apollo kept off all

17989,ARGUMENT.,"being dead, ye will not venture to take away for his wife, and mother,"
17990,ARGUMENT.,"his son, and his father Priam, and the people to behold; who would"
17991,ARGUMENT.,"quickly burn him with fire, and perform his funeral rites. But ye wish"

17993,ARGUMENT.,"neither just disposition, nor flexible feelings in his breast; who is"
17994,ARGUMENT.,"skilled in savage deeds, as a lion, which, yielding to the impulse of"
17995,ARGUMENT.,"his mighty strength and haughty soul, attacks the flocks of men, that"
17996,ARGUMENT.,"he may take a repast. Thus has Achilles lost all compassion, nor in him"
17997,ARGUMENT.,"is there sense of shame, which greatly hurts and profits men. For"
17998,ARGUMENT.,"perhaps some one will lose another more dear, either a brother, or a"
17999,ARGUMENT.,"son; yet does he cease weeping and lamenting, for the Destinies have"
18000,ARGUMENT.,placed in men an enduring mind. But this man drags godlike Hector
18001,ARGUMENT.,"around the tomb of his dear companion, binding him to his chariot,"
18002,ARGUMENT.,after he has taken away his dear life; yet truly this is neither more
18003,ARGUMENT.,"honourable, nor better for him. [Let him beware] lest we be indignant"

18008,ARGUMENT.,"be our language, O God of the silver bow, if now thou assignest equal"
18009,ARGUMENT.,"honour to Achilles and to Hector. Hector indeed is a mortal, and sucked"
18010,ARGUMENT.,"a woman’s breast; but Achilles is the offspring of a goddess, whom I"
18011,ARGUMENT.,"myself both nurtured and educated, and gave as a wife to the hero"
18012,ARGUMENT.,"Peleus, who is dear to the immortals in their heart: and ye were all"
18013,ARGUMENT.,"present at the nuptials, 776 O gods; and thou didst feast amongst them,"
18014,ARGUMENT.,"holding thy lyre, O companion of the evil, ever faithless.”"
18015,ARGUMENT.,
18016,ARGUMENT.,"But her cloud-compelling Jove, answering, addressed:"
18017,ARGUMENT.,
18018,ARGUMENT.,"“Ο Juno, be not now completely enraged with the gods; for their honour"
18019,ARGUMENT.,shall not be at all equal: but Hector also was the dearest of mortals
18020,ARGUMENT.,"to the gods, of [those] who are in Ilium; for thus was he to me; for"
18021,ARGUMENT.,never did he miss [offering] pleasing gifts. For never did my altar
18022,ARGUMENT.,"lack the fitting banquet, or incense, or odour: for this honour are we"
18023,ARGUMENT.,allotted. Yet let us forego to steal away bold Hector; (nor is it at
18024,ARGUMENT.,all practicable without the knowledge of Achilles;) for he is ever by
18025,ARGUMENT.,"him both by night and day, like as a mother. But let some of the gods"
18026,ARGUMENT.,"call Thetis near me, that to her I may tell prudent advice, in order"
18027,ARGUMENT.,"that Achilles may receive gifts from Priam, and ransom Hector.”"
18028,ARGUMENT.,
18029,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but Iris, swift as the whirlwind, rose up, about to bear"
18030,ARGUMENT.,his message. Half way between Samos and rugged Imbrus she plunged into
18031,ARGUMENT.,"the dark sea, and the ocean groaned. She sank to the bottom like unto a"
18032,ARGUMENT.,"leaden ball, 777 which, [placed] along the horn of a wild bull,"
18033,ARGUMENT.,"entering, descends, bearing death to the raw-devouring fishes. But she"
18034,ARGUMENT.,"found Thetis in her hollow cave, and the other sea goddesses sat around"
18035,ARGUMENT.,"her, assembled together; she indeed, in the midst, lamented the fate of"
18036,ARGUMENT.,"her own blameless son, who was about to perish in fertile Troy, far"
18037,ARGUMENT.,"away from his native land. But her swift-footed Iris, standing near,"
18038,ARGUMENT.,addressed:

18040,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 776: (return)  See Grote, vol. i. p. 257."
18041,ARGUMENT.,
18042,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 777: (return)  The only clear explanation of this passage

18045,ARGUMENT.,"end, run over a piece of horn fixed at the side of the boat,” to"
18046,ARGUMENT.,"prevent, as Kennedy remarks, the wear from friction. Pollux, x. 30, 31,"
18047,ARGUMENT.,merely mentions the μολυβδαίνη among the implements of fishermen; but
18048,ARGUMENT.,says nothing of the manner in which it was used.
18049,ARGUMENT.,
18050,ARGUMENT.,"“Rise, O Thetis; Jove, skilled in imperishable counsels, calls thee.”"
18051,ARGUMENT.,
18052,ARGUMENT.,Her then the silver-footed goddess Thetis answered:
18053,ARGUMENT.,
18054,ARGUMENT.,“Why does that mighty god call me? I am ashamed to mix with the
18055,ARGUMENT.,"immortals, for I have innumerable griefs in my soul. Yet must I go; for"
18056,ARGUMENT.,the word which he utters will not be in vain.”
18057,ARGUMENT.,
18058,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having spoken, the divine one of goddesses took her dark robe,"
18059,ARGUMENT.,"than which no garment is blacker. And she set out to go, whilst"
18060,ARGUMENT.,"wind-footed, fleet Iris led the way; and the water of the sea retired"
18061,ARGUMENT.,"on each side of them. 778 Next ascending the shore, they were impelled"
18062,ARGUMENT.,up to heaven. They found the far-sounding son of Saturn; and all the
18063,ARGUMENT.,other blessed immortal gods sat assembled around him; but she then sat
18064,ARGUMENT.,"down beside father Jove, and Minerva gave place to her. Then Juno"
18065,ARGUMENT.,"placed a beautiful golden goblet in her hand, and consoled her with"
18066,ARGUMENT.,"words; and Thetis having drunk, returned it. But to them the father of"
18067,ARGUMENT.,men and gods began discourse:
18068,ARGUMENT.,
18069,ARGUMENT.,"“Thou hast come to Olympus, although sad, Ο goddess Thetis, having in"
18070,ARGUMENT.,thy mind a grief not to be forgotten; and I know it. Yet even thus will
18071,ARGUMENT.,"I speak, and on this account have I called thee hither. Nine days has a"
18072,ARGUMENT.,contest already been excited amongst the immortals respecting the body
18073,ARGUMENT.,"of Hector, and Achilles the destroyer of cities, and they have urged"
18074,ARGUMENT.,the watchful slayer of Argus to steal him. But I bestow this glory 779
18075,ARGUMENT.,"on Achilles, securing for the future thy respect and love. Descend very"
18076,ARGUMENT.,"speedily to the camp, and give orders to thy son. Tell him that the"
18077,ARGUMENT.,"gods are offended, and that I am angry above all the immortals, because"
18078,ARGUMENT.,"with infuriated mind he detains Hector at the crooked barks, nor has"
18079,ARGUMENT.,"released him: if perchance he will revere me, and restore Hector."
18080,ARGUMENT.,"Meanwhile I will despatch Iris to magnanimous Priam, that, going to the"
18081,ARGUMENT.,"ships of the Greeks, he may ransom his beloved son, and carry offerings"
18082,ARGUMENT.,"to Achilles, which may melt his soul.”"

18095,ARGUMENT.,
18096,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; nor did the silver-footed goddess Thetis disobey; but,"
18097,ARGUMENT.,"rushing impetuously, she descended down from the tops of Olympus. Then"
18098,ARGUMENT.,"she came to the tent of her son, and found him within, moaning"
18099,ARGUMENT.,"continually, whilst around him his dear comrades were busily occupied,"
18100,ARGUMENT.,"and prepared a feast, for a great thick-fleeced sheep had been"
18101,ARGUMENT.,slaughtered by them in the tent. But his venerable mother sat down very
18102,ARGUMENT.,"near him, and caressed him with her hand, and spoke, and addressed him:"
18103,ARGUMENT.,
18104,ARGUMENT.,"“O my son, how long, grieving and bewailing, wilt thou afflict thine"
18105,ARGUMENT.,"heart, being not at all mindful of either food or bed? But it is good"
18106,ARGUMENT.,to be mingled in love with a woman; for thou shalt not live long for
18107,ARGUMENT.,"me, but Death and stern Fate already stand near thee. But quickly"
18108,ARGUMENT.,"attend to me, for I am a messenger to thee from Jove. He says that the"
18109,ARGUMENT.,"gods are angry with thee, and that he himself above all the immortals"
18110,ARGUMENT.,"is enraged, because with furious mind thou detainest Hector at the"
18111,ARGUMENT.,"hollow ships, nor dost release him. But come, release him, and receive"
18112,ARGUMENT.,ransoms for the dead body.”
18113,ARGUMENT.,
18114,ARGUMENT.,"But her swift-footed Achilles, answering, addressed:"
18115,ARGUMENT.,
18116,ARGUMENT.,"“Let him approach hither, who may bear the ransoms, and bear away the"
18117,ARGUMENT.,"body, if indeed the Olympian himself now commands it with a serious"
18118,ARGUMENT.,"mind.” Thus they indeed, the mother and the son, amongst the assemblage"
18119,ARGUMENT.,"of the ships, spoke many winged words to each other; but the son of"
18120,ARGUMENT.,Saturn impelled Iris towards sacred Ilium:
18121,ARGUMENT.,
18122,ARGUMENT.,"“Go quickly, fleet Iris, having left the seat of Olympus, order"
18123,ARGUMENT.,"magnanimous Priam to ransom his dear son to Ilium, going to the ships"
18124,ARGUMENT.,"of the Greeks; and to carry gifts to Achilles, which may appease his"
18125,ARGUMENT.,"mind, alone; nor let another man of the Trojans go with him. Let some"
18126,ARGUMENT.,"aged herald accompany him, who may guide his mules and well-wheeled"
18127,ARGUMENT.,"chariot, and may bear back to the city the dead body which noble"
18128,ARGUMENT.,Achilles has slain; nor let death at all be a cause of anxiety to his
18129,ARGUMENT.,"mind, nor at all a terror; such a conductor, the slayer of Argus, will"
18130,ARGUMENT.,"we give to him, who shall lead him, until, directing, he shall place"
18131,ARGUMENT.,him beside Achilles. But when he shall have conducted him into the tent
18132,ARGUMENT.,"of Achilles, he will not kill him himself, and he will ward off all"
18133,ARGUMENT.,"others; for he is neither imprudent, nor rash, nor profane; but will"
18134,ARGUMENT.,very humanely spare a suppliant man.”
18135,ARGUMENT.,
18136,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but wind-footed Iris rushed on, about to carry her"
18137,ARGUMENT.,"message. She came to [the palace] of Priam, and found wailing and"
18138,ARGUMENT.,"lamentation. His sons, sitting around their father within the hall,"
18139,ARGUMENT.,were drenching their robes with tears; whilst the old man sat in the
18140,ARGUMENT.,"midst, covered entirely 780 with a cloak; but much filth was around"
18141,ARGUMENT.,"upon the head and neck of the aged man, which, while rolling [on the"
18142,ARGUMENT.,"ground], he had abundantly collected 781 with his own hands. But his"
18143,ARGUMENT.,"daughters and daughters-in-law throughout the dwelling lamented,"
18144,ARGUMENT.,"remembering those who, many and brave, lay, having lost their lives by"
18145,ARGUMENT.,the hands of the Greeks. Then the ambassadress of Jove stood beside
18146,ARGUMENT.,"Priam, and addressed him in an under-tone; and tremor seized him as to"
18147,ARGUMENT.,his limbs:
18148,ARGUMENT.,
18149,ARGUMENT.,"“Take courage, O Dardanian Priam, in thy mind, nor fear at all; for"
18150,ARGUMENT.,"indeed I come not hither boding 782 evil to thee, but meditating good;"
18151,ARGUMENT.,"for I am an ambassadress from Jove to thee, who, though being far off,"
18152,ARGUMENT.,greatly cares for and pities thee. The Olympian bids thee ransom noble
18153,ARGUMENT.,"Hector, and bear presents to Achilles, which may melt his soul; thee"
18154,ARGUMENT.,"alone, nor let another man of the Trojans go with thee. But let some"
18155,ARGUMENT.,"aged herald accompany thee, who may guide thy mules and well-wheeled"
18156,ARGUMENT.,"chariot, and bring back to the city the dead which noble Achilles has"
18157,ARGUMENT.,"slain. Nor let death be a cause of anxiety to thy mind, nor fear at all"
18158,ARGUMENT.,"such a conductor; the slayer of Argus shall attend thee, who shall lead"
18159,ARGUMENT.,"thee, until, guiding, he shall bring thee near Achilles. But when he"
18160,ARGUMENT.,"shall have led thee into the tent of Achilles, he will not slay thee"
18161,ARGUMENT.,"himself, and he will ward off all others; for he is neither imprudent,"
18162,ARGUMENT.,"nor rash, nor profane; but will very humanely spare a suppliant man.”"

18214,ARGUMENT.,"“Do not detain me, desirous to go, nor be thou thyself an evil-omen"
18215,ARGUMENT.,bird in my palaces; nor shalt thou persuade me. For if indeed any other
18216,ARGUMENT.,"of earthly beings had ordered me, whether they be prophets,"
18217,ARGUMENT.,"soothsayers, or priests, we might have pronounced it a falsehood, and"
18218,ARGUMENT.,been the more averse. But now since I myself have heard it from a
18219,ARGUMENT.,"deity, and have beheld her face to face, I will go, nor shall this word"
18220,ARGUMENT.,be vain and if it be my fate to die at the ships of the brazen-mailed
18221,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks, I am willing; for Achilles will forthwith, slay me, embracing"
18222,ARGUMENT.,"my son in my arms, after I have taken away the desire of weeping.”"
18223,ARGUMENT.,
18224,ARGUMENT.,"He spoke; and opened the beautiful lids of the chests, and took out"
18225,ARGUMENT.,"thence twelve beautiful mantles, twelve single cloaks, as many"
18226,ARGUMENT.,"tapestried rugs, and, in addition to these, as many tunics; and having"
18227,ARGUMENT.,"weighed it, he took out ten whole talents of gold. He took out beside"
18228,ARGUMENT.,"two glittering tripods, and four goblets, and a very beautiful cup,"
18229,ARGUMENT.,"which the Thracian men had given him when going on an embassy, a mighty"
18230,ARGUMENT.,possession. Nor now did the old man spare even this in his palaces; for
18231,ARGUMENT.,he greatly wished in his mind to ransom his dear son. And he drove away
18232,ARGUMENT.,"all the Trojans from his porch, chiding them with reproachful words:"
18233,ARGUMENT.,
18234,ARGUMENT.,"“Depart, wretched, reproachful [creatures]; is there not indeed grief"
18235,ARGUMENT.,"to you at home, that ye should come fretting me? Or do ye esteem it of"
18236,ARGUMENT.,"little consequence that Jove, the son of Saturn, has sent sorrows upon"
18237,ARGUMENT.,"me, that I should have lost my bravest son? But ye too shall perceive"
18238,ARGUMENT.,"it, for ye will be much more easy for the Greeks to destroy now, he"
18239,ARGUMENT.,"being dead; but I will descend even to the abode of Hades, before I"
18240,ARGUMENT.,behold with mine eyes the city sacked and plundered.”
18241,ARGUMENT.,
18242,ARGUMENT.,"He spoke; and chased away the men with his staff; but they went out,"
18243,ARGUMENT.,"the old man driving [them]. He indeed rebuked his own sons, reviling"
18244,ARGUMENT.,"Helenus, Paris, and godlike Agathon, Pammon, Antiphonus, and Polites,"
18245,ARGUMENT.,"brave in the din of battle, Deïphobus, Hippothous, and renowned Dius."
18246,ARGUMENT.,"To these nine the old man, reproaching, gave orders:"
18247,ARGUMENT.,
18248,ARGUMENT.,"“Haste for me, O slothful children, disgraceful; would that you had all"

18250,ARGUMENT.,"unhappy of all, since I have begotten the bravest sons in wide Troy;"
18251,ARGUMENT.,"but none of whom I think is left: godlike Mestor, and Troulus, who"
18252,ARGUMENT.,"fought from his chariot, and Hector, who was a god among men, for he"
18253,ARGUMENT.,"did not appear to be the son of a mortal man, but of a god. These"
18254,ARGUMENT.,"indeed has Mars destroyed to me; but all these disgraces remain, liars,"
18255,ARGUMENT.,"dancers, 785 most skilled in the choirs, and public robbers of lambs"
18256,ARGUMENT.,"and kids. Will ye not with all haste get ready my chariot, and place"

18264,ARGUMENT.,"out the well-wheeled, mule-drawn chariot, beautiful, newly built, and"
18265,ARGUMENT.,tied the chest 786 upon it. They then took down the yoke for the mules
18266,ARGUMENT.,"from the pin, made of box-wood, and embossed, well fitted with rings,"
18267,ARGUMENT.,"and then they brought out the yoke-band, nine cubits in length, along"
18268,ARGUMENT.,with the yoke. And this indeed they adjusted carefully to the pole at
18269,ARGUMENT.,"its extremity, and threw the ring over the bolt. Thrice they lapped it"
18270,ARGUMENT.,"on either side to the boss; and when they had fastened, they turned it"
18271,ARGUMENT.,"evenly under the bend; then, bearing the inestimable ransoms of"
18272,ARGUMENT.,"Hector’s head from the chamber, they piled them upon the well-polished"
18273,ARGUMENT.,"car. Then they yoked the strong-hoofed mules, patient in labour, which"
18274,ARGUMENT.,"the Mysians formerly gave to Priam, splendid gifts. They also led under"
18275,ARGUMENT.,"the yoke for Priam, the horses, which the old man himself had fed at"
18276,ARGUMENT.,the well-polished manger. These indeed the herald and Priam yoked in
18277,ARGUMENT.,"the lofty palace, having prudent counsels in their minds. But near them"
18278,ARGUMENT.,"came Hecuba, with sad mind, bearing sweet wine in her right hand, in a"
18279,ARGUMENT.,"golden goblet, in order that having made libations, they might depart."
18280,ARGUMENT.,"But she stood before the steeds, and spoke, and addressed them:"

18285,ARGUMENT.,"to the dark, cloud-compelling Idæan son of Saturn, who looks down upon"
18286,ARGUMENT.,"all Troy; but seek the fleet bird, his messenger, which to him is the"
18287,ARGUMENT.,"most pleasing of birds, and whose strength is very great, on thy right"
18288,ARGUMENT.,"hand, so that, marking him thyself with thine eyes, thou mayest go,"
18289,ARGUMENT.,"relying on him, to the ships of the fleet-horsed Greeks. But if"
18290,ARGUMENT.,"wide-viewing Jove will not give thee his own messenger, I would not at"

18303,ARGUMENT.,me.”
18304,ARGUMENT.,
18305,ARGUMENT.,"The old man spoke, and bade the attending servant pour pure water upon"
18306,ARGUMENT.,"his hands; for a handmaid stood by, holding in her hands a basin, and"
18307,ARGUMENT.,"also an ewer; and having washed himself, he took the goblet from his"
18308,ARGUMENT.,"wife. Then he prayed, standing in the midst of the enclosure, and"
18309,ARGUMENT.,"poured out a libation of wine, looking towards heaven; and raising his"
18310,ARGUMENT.,"voice, spoke:"
18311,ARGUMENT.,
18312,ARGUMENT.,"“O father Jove, ruling from Ida, most glorious, most great, grant me to"
18313,ARGUMENT.,come acceptable and pitied to [the tent] of Achilles; and send the
18314,ARGUMENT.,"swift bird, thy messenger, which is the most agreeable of birds to"

18317,ARGUMENT.,ships of the fleet-horsed Greeks.”
18318,ARGUMENT.,
18319,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke, praying; but to him provident Jove hearkened, and"
18320,ARGUMENT.,"immediately sent an eagle, the Black Hunter, the most certain augury of"
18321,ARGUMENT.,"birds, which they also call Percnos. 788 As large as the well-bolted,"
18322,ARGUMENT.,"closely-fitted door of the lofty-roofed chamber of a wealthy man, so"
18323,ARGUMENT.,"great were its wings on each side; and it appeared to them, rushing on"
18324,ARGUMENT.,"the right hand over the city. But they, having seen it, rejoiced, and"
18325,ARGUMENT.,"the soul was overjoyed in their bosoms. Then the old man, hastening,"
18326,ARGUMENT.,"mounted his polished car, and drove out of the vestibule and"
18327,ARGUMENT.,"much-echoing porch. Before, indeed, the mules drew the four-wheeled"
18328,ARGUMENT.,"car, which prudent Idæus drove; but after [came] the horses, which the"
18329,ARGUMENT.,"old man cheered on, driving briskly through the city with his lash; but"
18330,ARGUMENT.,"all his friends accompanied, greatly weeping for him, as if going to"
18331,ARGUMENT.,"death. But when they had descended from the city, and reached the"
18332,ARGUMENT.,"plain, his sons and sons-in-law then returned to Ilium. Nor did these"
18333,ARGUMENT.,"two, advancing on the plain, escape the notice of far-seeing Jove; but,"
18334,ARGUMENT.,"seeing the old man, he pitied him, and straightway addressed his"
18335,ARGUMENT.,beloved son:

18340,ARGUMENT.,“O Mercury (for to thee it is peculiarly grateful to associate with
18341,ARGUMENT.,"man, and thou hearest whomsoever thou art willing), go now, and so"
18342,ARGUMENT.,"convey Priam to the hollow ships of the Greeks, that neither any one"

18344,ARGUMENT.,reach the son of Peleus.”
18345,ARGUMENT.,
18346,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; nor did the messenger, the son of Argus. disobey. 789"
18347,ARGUMENT.,"Immediately then he fastened under his feet his beautiful sandals,"
18348,ARGUMENT.,"ambrosial, golden, which carry him as well over the sea, as over the"
18349,ARGUMENT.,"boundless earth, with the blasts of the wind. He also took his rod,"
18350,ARGUMENT.,"with which he soothes the eyes of those men whom he wishes, and again"
18351,ARGUMENT.,"excites others who are asleep; holding this in his hands, the powerful"
18352,ARGUMENT.,slayer of Argus flew along. But he immediately reached the Troad and
18353,ARGUMENT.,"the Hellespont, and hastened to go, like unto a princely youth, first"
18354,ARGUMENT.,"springing into youth, whose youth is very graceful. And they, when they"
18355,ARGUMENT.,"had driven by the great tomb of Ilus, stopped their mules and horses,"
18356,ARGUMENT.,that they might drink in the river; for even now twilight had come over
18357,ARGUMENT.,"the earth. But the herald, spying, observed Mercury near, and addressed"
18358,ARGUMENT.,"Priam, and said:"

18360,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 789: (return)  Compare Milton, P.L. v. 285, sqq., with"

18363,ARGUMENT.,"“Beware, O descendant of Dardanus; this is matter for prudent thought."
18364,ARGUMENT.,"I perceive a warrior, and I think that he will soon destroy us. But"
18365,ARGUMENT.,"come, let us fly upon our steeds; or let us now, grasping his knees,"
18366,ARGUMENT.,"entreat him, if he would pity us.” Thus he spoke, but the mind of the"
18367,ARGUMENT.,"old man was confounded, and he greatly feared; but the hair stood"
18368,ARGUMENT.,upright on his bending limbs. And he stood stupified; but Mercury
18369,ARGUMENT.,"himself coming near, taking the old man’s hand, interrogated, and"
18370,ARGUMENT.,addressed him:
18371,ARGUMENT.,
18372,ARGUMENT.,"“Whither, O father, dost thou this way direct thy horses and mules"
18373,ARGUMENT.,"during the ambrosial night, when other mortals are asleep? Dost thou"
18374,ARGUMENT.,"not fear the valour-breathing Greeks, who, enemies and hostile to thee,"
18375,ARGUMENT.,are at hand? If any one of these should see thee in the dark and
18376,ARGUMENT.,"dangerous night, bearing off so many valuables, what intention would"
18377,ARGUMENT.,"then be towards thee? Neither art thou young thyself, and this [is] an"
18378,ARGUMENT.,"old man who accompanies thee, to repel a warrior when first any may"
18379,ARGUMENT.,"molest thee. But I will not do thee injury, but will avert another from"
18380,ARGUMENT.,"thee, for I think thee like my dear father.”"
18381,ARGUMENT.,
18382,ARGUMENT.,"But him Priam, the godlike old man, then answered:"
18383,ARGUMENT.,
18384,ARGUMENT.,"“Surely these things are as thou sayest, my dear son. But hitherto some"
18385,ARGUMENT.,"one of the gods has protected me with his hand, who has sent such a"
18386,ARGUMENT.,"favourable conductor to meet me, so beautiful art thou in form and"
18387,ARGUMENT.,"appearance. And thou art also prudent in mind, and of blessed parents.”"
18388,ARGUMENT.,"But him again the messenger, the slayer of Argus, addressed: “O old"
18389,ARGUMENT.,"man, thou hast certainly spoken all these things with propriety. But"
18390,ARGUMENT.,"come, tell me this, and relate it truly; whither now dost thou send so"
18391,ARGUMENT.,many and such valuable treasures amongst foreigners? Whether that
18392,ARGUMENT.,"these, at least, may remain safe to thee? Or do ye all, now fearing,"
18393,ARGUMENT.,"desert sacred Ilium? For so brave a hero, was he who died, thy son; he"
18394,ARGUMENT.,was not in aught inferior to the Greeks in battle.”
18395,ARGUMENT.,
18396,ARGUMENT.,"But him Priam, the godlike old man, then answered:"
18397,ARGUMENT.,
18398,ARGUMENT.,"“But who art thou, O best one, and of what parents art thou, who"
18399,ARGUMENT.,speakest so honourably to me of the death of my luckless son?”
18400,ARGUMENT.,
18401,ARGUMENT.,"But him again the messenger, the slayer of Argus, addressed:"
18402,ARGUMENT.,
18403,ARGUMENT.,"“Thou triest me, old man. and inquirest concerning noble Hector; whom"
18404,ARGUMENT.,"I, indeed, have very often beheld with mine eyes in the glorious fight,"
18405,ARGUMENT.,"when, routing the Greeks, he slew them at their ships, destroying"
18406,ARGUMENT.,"[them] with his sharp spear; but we, standing, marvelled; for Achilles,"
18407,ARGUMENT.,"enraged with the son of Atreus, did not permit us to fight. But I am"
18408,ARGUMENT.,"his attendant, and the same well-made vessel brought us. I am [one] of"
18409,ARGUMENT.,"the Myrmidons; Polyetor is my father, who, indeed, is rich, but now old"
18410,ARGUMENT.,"as thou. To him there are six sons, but I am his seventh; with whom"
18411,ARGUMENT.,"casting lots, the lot occurred to me to follow [Achilles] hither. And I"
18412,ARGUMENT.,"came to the plain from the ships, for at dawn the rolling-eyed Greeks"
18413,ARGUMENT.,will raise a fight around the city. For they are indignant sitting
18414,ARGUMENT.,"quiet, nor can the chiefs of the Greeks restrain them, longing for"
18415,ARGUMENT.,war.”
18416,ARGUMENT.,
18417,ARGUMENT.,"But him then Priam, the godlike old man, answered:"
18418,ARGUMENT.,
18419,ARGUMENT.,"“If indeed thou art one of the servants of Achilles, the son of Peleus,"
18420,ARGUMENT.,"come now, tell all the truth to me, whether is my son still at the"
18421,ARGUMENT.,"ships, or has Achilles, tearing him limb from limb, cast him to the"
18422,ARGUMENT.,dogs?”
18423,ARGUMENT.,
18424,ARGUMENT.,"But him the messenger, the slayer of Argus, again addressed:"
18425,ARGUMENT.,
18426,ARGUMENT.,"“O old man, neither have the dogs yet devoured him, nor the birds, but"
18427,ARGUMENT.,"he still lies at the ship of Achilles, in the same plight as before, at"
18428,ARGUMENT.,"his tents; and it is [now] the twelfth morning him lying, yet his body"
18429,ARGUMENT.,"is not at all putrid, nor do the worms devour him, which consume men"
18430,ARGUMENT.,slain in battle. Doubtless he will drag him cruelly around the tomb of
18431,ARGUMENT.,his dear companion when divine morn appears; but he does not defile
18432,ARGUMENT.,"him. Approaching, thou indeed thyself wouldst wonder how fresh 790 he"
18433,ARGUMENT.,"lies, while the blood is washed away from around, nor [is he] polluted"
18434,ARGUMENT.,"in any part. But all his wounds are closed, whatever were inflicted;"
18435,ARGUMENT.,for many thrust a spear into him. Thus do the happy gods regard thy
18436,ARGUMENT.,"son, though dead; for he was dear to them in their heart.”"
18437,ARGUMENT.,
18438,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but the old man rejoiced, and answered in words:"
18439,ARGUMENT.,
18440,ARGUMENT.,"“O son, surely it is good to give due gifts to the immortals, for my"
18441,ARGUMENT.,"son, while he was yet in being, never neglected the gods who possess"
18442,ARGUMENT.,"Olympus, in his palace; therefore are they mindful of him, although in"
18443,ARGUMENT.,"the fate of death. But come now, accept from me this beautiful goblet;"
18444,ARGUMENT.,"protect myself, 791 and, with the favour of the gods, conduct me until"
18445,ARGUMENT.,I come into the tent of the son of Peleus.”

18450,ARGUMENT.,"body,” quoting Hesych., ῥύεσθαι, λοτρώσασθαι."
18451,ARGUMENT.,
18452,ARGUMENT.,"But him the slayer of Argus again addressed: “Old man, thou triest me,"
18453,ARGUMENT.,[being] younger; nor wilt thou now persuade me; thou who orderest me to
18454,ARGUMENT.,"accept thy gifts unknown to Achilles; whom indeed I dread, and scruple"
18455,ARGUMENT.,"in my heart to plunder, lest some evil should afterwards come upon me."
18456,ARGUMENT.,"Yet would I go as a conductor to thee even to renowned Argos,"
18457,ARGUMENT.,"sedulously, in a swift ship, or accompanying thee on foot; nor, indeed,"
18458,ARGUMENT.,"would any one contend with thee, despising thy guide.”"
18459,ARGUMENT.,
18460,ARGUMENT.,"Mercury spoke, and, leaping upon the chariot and horses, quickly took"
18461,ARGUMENT.,"the scourge and the reins in his hands, and breathed bold vigour into"
18462,ARGUMENT.,the horses and mules. But when they had now reached the ramparts and
18463,ARGUMENT.,"trench of the ships, then the guards were just employed about their"
18464,ARGUMENT.,"feast, and the messenger, the slayer of Argus, poured sleep upon them"
18465,ARGUMENT.,"all; and immediately he opened the gates and pushed back the bars, and"
18466,ARGUMENT.,"led in Priam, and the splendid gifts upon the car. But when they"
18467,ARGUMENT.,reached the lofty tent of Achilles which the Myrmidons had reared for
18468,ARGUMENT.,"their king, lopping fir timbers; and they roofed it over with a"
18469,ARGUMENT.,"thatched roof, mowing it from the mead, and made a great fence around,"
18470,ARGUMENT.,"with thick-set stakes, for their king: one bar only of fir held the"
18471,ARGUMENT.,"door, which, indeed, three Greeks used to fasten, and three used to"
18472,ARGUMENT.,open the great fastening of the gates; but Achilles even alone used to
18473,ARGUMENT.,"shoot it. Then, indeed, profitable Mercury opened it for the old man,"
18474,ARGUMENT.,and led in the splendid presents to swift-footed Achilles; then he
18475,ARGUMENT.,"descended to the ground, from the chariot, and said:"
18476,ARGUMENT.,
18477,ARGUMENT.,"“O old man, I indeed come, an immortal god, Mercury, to thee; for to"
18478,ARGUMENT.,"thee my father sent me as companion. Yet shall I return indeed, nor be"
18479,ARGUMENT.,present before the eyes of Achilles; for it would indeed be invidious
18480,ARGUMENT.,"for an immortal god so openly to aid mortals. But do thou, entering,"
18481,ARGUMENT.,"clasp the knees of the son of Peleus, and supplicate him by his father,"
18482,ARGUMENT.,"and fair-haired mother, and his son; that thou mayest effect his mind.”"
18483,ARGUMENT.,
18484,ARGUMENT.,"Thus, indeed, having spoken, Mercury went to lofty Olympus; and Priam"
18485,ARGUMENT.,"leaped from his chariot to the ground, and left Idæus there: but he"
18486,ARGUMENT.,"remained, guarding the steeds and mules; while the old man went"
18487,ARGUMENT.,"straight into the tent, where Achilles, dear to Jove, was sitting."
18488,ARGUMENT.,"Himself he found within; but his companions sat apart; but two alone,"
18489,ARGUMENT.,"the hero Automedon, and Alcimus, a branch of Mars, standing near, were"
18490,ARGUMENT.,"ministering to him (for, eating and drinking, he had just ceased from"
18491,ARGUMENT.,"food, and the table still remained); but great Priam, entering, escaped"
18492,ARGUMENT.,"his notice, and, standing near, he clasped the knees of Achilles with"
18493,ARGUMENT.,"his hands, and kissed his dreadful man-slaughtering hands, which had"
18494,ARGUMENT.,slain many sons to him. And as when a dread sense of guilt has seized a
18495,ARGUMENT.,"man, who, having killed a man in his own country, comes to another"
18496,ARGUMENT.,"people, to [the abode of] some wealthy man, 792 and stupor possesses"
18497,ARGUMENT.,"the spectators; so Achilles wondered, seeing godlike Priam; and the"
18498,ARGUMENT.,"others also wondered, and looked at one another. And Priam,"
18499,ARGUMENT.,"supplicating, spoke [this] speech:"
18500,ARGUMENT.,
18501,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 792: (return)  Probably for the purpose of purification,"
18502,ARGUMENT.,"although, as has been before observed, Homer does not mention this."

18504,ARGUMENT.,
18505,ARGUMENT.,"“Remember thy own father, O Achilles, like unto the gods, of equal age"
18506,ARGUMENT.,"with me, upon the sad threshold of old age. And perhaps indeed his"
18507,ARGUMENT.,"neighbours around are perplexing him, nor is there any one to ward off"
18508,ARGUMENT.,"war and destruction. Yet he indeed, hearing of thee being alive, both"
18509,ARGUMENT.,"rejoices in his mind, and every day expects to see his dear son"
18510,ARGUMENT.,"returned from Troy. But I [am] every way unhappy, for I begat the"
18511,ARGUMENT.,"bravest sons in wide Troy, of whom I say that none are left. Fifty"
18512,ARGUMENT.,"there were to me, when the sons of the Greeks arrived; nineteen indeed"
18513,ARGUMENT.,"from one womb, but the others women bore to me in my palaces. And of"
18514,ARGUMENT.,the greater number fierce Mars indeed has relaxed the knees under them;
18515,ARGUMENT.,"but Hector, who was my favourite, 793 and defended the city and"
18516,ARGUMENT.,"ourselves, thou hast lately slain, fighting for his country; on account"
18517,ARGUMENT.,"of whom I now come to the ships of the Greeks, and bring countless"
18518,ARGUMENT.,"ransoms, in order to redeem him from thee. But revere the gods, O"
18519,ARGUMENT.,"Achilles, and have pity on myself, remembering thy father; for I am"
18520,ARGUMENT.,"even more miserable, for I have endured what no other earthly mortal"
18521,ARGUMENT.,"[has], to put to my mouth the hand of a man, the slayer of my son.”"
18522,ARGUMENT.,
18523,ARGUMENT.,Thus he spoke; but in him he excited the desire of mourning for his
18524,ARGUMENT.,"father; and taking him by the hand, he gently pushed the old man from"
18525,ARGUMENT.,"him. But they indeed, calling to mind, the one 794 wept copiously [for]"
18526,ARGUMENT.,"man-slaughtering Hector, rolling [on the ground] before the feet of"
18527,ARGUMENT.,"Achilles; but Achilles bewailed his father, and again in turn"
18528,ARGUMENT.,Patroclus; and their lamentation was aroused throughout the house. But
18529,ARGUMENT.,"when noble Achilles had satiated himself with grief, and the desire"
18530,ARGUMENT.,"[for weeping] had departed from his heart and limbs, immediately rising"
18531,ARGUMENT.,"from his seat, he lifted up the old man with his hand, compassionating"
18532,ARGUMENT.,"both his hoary head and hoary chin; and, addressing him, spoke winged"
18533,ARGUMENT.,words:

18539,ARGUMENT.,"“Alas! wretched one, thou hast certainly suffered many evils in thy"
18540,ARGUMENT.,"mind. How hast thou dared to come alone to the ships of the Greeks,"
18541,ARGUMENT.,into the sight of the man who slew thy many and brave sons? Assuredly
18542,ARGUMENT.,"thy heart is iron. But come now, sit upon a seat; and let us permit"
18543,ARGUMENT.,"sorrows to sink to rest within thy mind, although grieved; for there is"
18544,ARGUMENT.,not any use in chill grief. For so have the gods destined to unhappy
18545,ARGUMENT.,"mortals, that they should live wretched; but they themselves are free"
18546,ARGUMENT.,"from care. 795 Two casks of gifts, 796which he bestows, lie at the"
18547,ARGUMENT.,"threshold of Jupiter, [the one] of evils, and the other of good. To"
18548,ARGUMENT.,"whom thunder-rejoicing Jove, mingling, may give them, sometimes he"
18549,ARGUMENT.,"falls into evil, but sometimes into good; but to whomsoever he gives of"
18550,ARGUMENT.,"the evil, he makes him exposed to injury; and hungry calamity pursues"
18551,ARGUMENT.,"him over the bounteous earth; and he wanders about, honoured neither by"
18552,ARGUMENT.,gods nor men. So indeed have the gods given illustrious gifts to Peleus
18553,ARGUMENT.,"from his birth; for he was conspicuous among men, both for riches and"
18554,ARGUMENT.,"wealth, and he ruled over the Myrmidons, and to him, being a mortal,"
18555,ARGUMENT.,they gave a goddess for a wife. 797 But upon him also has a deity
18556,ARGUMENT.,"inflicted evil, for there was not to him in his palaces an offspring of"
18557,ARGUMENT.,kingly sons; but he begat one short-lived son; nor indeed do I cherish
18558,ARGUMENT.,"him, being old, for I remain in Troy, far away from my country, causing"
18559,ARGUMENT.,"sorrow to thee and to thy sons. Thee too, old man, we learn to have"
18560,ARGUMENT.,"been formerly wealthy: as much as Lesbos, above the seat of Macar, cuts"
18561,ARGUMENT.,"off on the north, and Phrygia beneath, and the boundless Hellespont:"
18562,ARGUMENT.,"among these, O old man, they say that thou wast conspicuous for thy"
18563,ARGUMENT.,wealth and thy sons. But since the heavenly inhabitants have brought
18564,ARGUMENT.,"this bane upon thee, wars and the slaying of men are constantly around"
18565,ARGUMENT.,"thy city. Arise, nor grieve incessantly in thy mind; for thou wilt not"
18566,ARGUMENT.,"profit aught, afflicting thyself for thy son, nor wilt thou resuscitate"
18567,ARGUMENT.,him before thou hast suffered another misfortune.”

18577,ARGUMENT.,
18578,ARGUMENT.,"But him Priam, the godlike old man, then, answered:"
18579,ARGUMENT.,
18580,ARGUMENT.,"“Do not at all place me on a seat, Ο Jove-nurtured, whilst Hector lies"
18581,ARGUMENT.,"unburied in thy tents; but redeem him as soon as possible, that I may"
18582,ARGUMENT.,behold him with mine eyes; and do thou receive the many ransoms which
18583,ARGUMENT.,"we bring thee; and mayest thou enjoy them, and reach thy father-land,"
18584,ARGUMENT.,"since thou hast suffered me in the first place to live, and to behold"
18585,ARGUMENT.,the light of the sun.”
18586,ARGUMENT.,
18587,ARGUMENT.,"But him swift-footed Achilles, sternly regarding, then addressed:"
18588,ARGUMENT.,
18589,ARGUMENT.,"“Do not irritate me further, old man, for I also myself meditate"
18590,ARGUMENT.,"ransoming Hector to thee; for the mother who bore me, the daughter of"
18591,ARGUMENT.,"the marine old man, came as a messenger from Jove to me. And I perceive"
18592,ARGUMENT.,"thee also, O Priam, in my mind, nor do thou deceive me, that some one"
18593,ARGUMENT.,of the gods has led thee to the swift ships of the Greeks; for a mortal
18594,ARGUMENT.,"would not have dared to come into the camp, not even in very blooming"
18595,ARGUMENT.,"youth, for he could not have escaped the guards, nor indeed pushed back"
18596,ARGUMENT.,"the bars of our gates. Wherefore do not move my mind more to sorrows,"
18597,ARGUMENT.,"lest I leave thee not unharmed, old man, in my tents, though being a"
18598,ARGUMENT.,"suppliant, and violate the commands of Jove.”"
18599,ARGUMENT.,
18600,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but the old man feared, and obeyed. But the son of"
18601,ARGUMENT.,"Peleus leaped forth, like a lion, from the door of the house, not"
18602,ARGUMENT.,"alone; for two attendants accompanied him, the hero Automedon, and"
18603,ARGUMENT.,"Alcimus, whom Achilles honoured most of his companions next after the"
18604,ARGUMENT.,deceased Patroclus. These then unharnessed the horses and mules from
18605,ARGUMENT.,"the yoke, and led in the clear-voiced herald of the old man, and placed"
18606,ARGUMENT.,him upon a seat. They also took down from the well-polished car the
18607,ARGUMENT.,countless ransoms of Hector’s head. But they left two cloaks and a
18608,ARGUMENT.,"well-woven tunic, in order that, having covered the body, he might give"
18609,ARGUMENT.,"it to be borne home. But having called his female attendants, he"
18610,ARGUMENT.,"ordered them to wash and anoint all round, taking it apart, that Priam"
18611,ARGUMENT.,"might not see his son; lest, seeing his son, he might not restrain the"
18612,ARGUMENT.,"wrath in his grieving heart, and might arouse the soul of Achilles, and"
18613,ARGUMENT.,"he might slay him, and violate the commands of Jove. But when the"
18614,ARGUMENT.,"servants had washed and anointed it with oil, they then threw over him"
18615,ARGUMENT.,"a beautiful cloak, and a tunic; then Achilles himself, having raised"
18616,ARGUMENT.,"him up, placed him upon a litter, and his companions, together with"
18617,ARGUMENT.,"[him], lifted him upon the well-polished chariot. But he moaned, and"
18618,ARGUMENT.,called upon his dear companion by name:
18619,ARGUMENT.,
18620,ARGUMENT.,"“O Patroclus, be not wrathful with me, if thou shouldst hear, although"
18621,ARGUMENT.,"being in Hades, that I have ransomed noble Hector to his beloved"
18622,ARGUMENT.,"father, since he has not given me unworthy ransoms. Besides even of"
18623,ARGUMENT.,"these will I give thee a share, whatever is just.”"
18624,ARGUMENT.,
18625,ARGUMENT.,"Noble Achilles spoke, and returned into the tent, and sat down upon a"
18626,ARGUMENT.,"well-made couch, whence he had risen, at the opposite wall, and"
18627,ARGUMENT.,addressed Priam:
18628,ARGUMENT.,
18629,ARGUMENT.,"“Thy son is indeed redeemed to thee, as thou didst desire, and lies"
18630,ARGUMENT.,"upon a bier; and with the early dawn thou shalt behold him, conveying"
18631,ARGUMENT.,[him away]: but now let us be mindful of the feast; for even
18632,ARGUMENT.,"fair-haired Niobe was mindful of food, although twelve children"
18633,ARGUMENT.,"perished in her palaces, six daughters and six youthful sons; these"
18634,ARGUMENT.,"indeed Apollo slew with his silver bow, enraged with Niobe; but those,"
18635,ARGUMENT.,"arrow-rejoicing Diana, because, forsooth, she had compared herself with"
18636,ARGUMENT.,"fair-cheeked Latona. She said that [Latona] had borne [only] two,"
18637,ARGUMENT.,"whereas she had borne many; yet those, though being only two, destroyed"
18638,ARGUMENT.,"all [her own]. Nine days indeed they lay in blood, nor was there any"
18639,ARGUMENT.,"one to bury them, for the son of Saturn had made the people stones; but"
18640,ARGUMENT.,upon the tenth day the heavenly gods interred them. Still was she
18641,ARGUMENT.,"mindful of food, when she was fatigued with weeping. Now, indeed, ever"
18642,ARGUMENT.,"amidst the rocks, in the desert mountains, in Sipylus, where, they say,"
18643,ARGUMENT.,"the beds of the goddess Nymphs are, who lead the dance around Acheloüs,"
18644,ARGUMENT.,"there, although being a stone, she broods over the sorrows [sent] from"
18645,ARGUMENT.,"the gods. But come now, O noble old man, let us likewise attend to"
18646,ARGUMENT.,"food, but afterwards thou mayest lament thy beloved son, conveying him"
18647,ARGUMENT.,into Troy; and he will be bewailed by thee with many tears.”
18648,ARGUMENT.,
18649,ARGUMENT.,"Swift Achilles spoke, and leaping up, slew a white sheep, and his"
18650,ARGUMENT.,"companions flayed it well, and fitly dressed it; then they skilfully"
18651,ARGUMENT.,"cut it in pieces, pierced them with spits, roasted them diligently, and"
18652,ARGUMENT.,"drew them all off. Then Automedon, taking bread, distributed it over"
18653,ARGUMENT.,"the table in beautiful baskets; whilst Achilles helped the meat, and"
18654,ARGUMENT.,they stretched out their hands to the prepared victuals lying before
18655,ARGUMENT.,"them. But when they had dismissed the desire of food and drink,"
18656,ARGUMENT.,"Dardanian Priam indeed marvelled at Achilles, such and so great; for he"
18657,ARGUMENT.,"was like unto the gods; but Achilles marvelled at Dardanian Priam,"
18658,ARGUMENT.,"seeing his amiable countenance, and hearing his conversation. When,"
18659,ARGUMENT.,"however, they were satisfied with gazing at each other, him Priam, the"
18660,ARGUMENT.,"godlike old man, first addressed:"
18661,ARGUMENT.,
18662,ARGUMENT.,"“Send me now to rest as soon as possible, Ο Jove-nurtured, that we,"
18663,ARGUMENT.,"reclining, may take our fill of sweet sleep; for never have these eyes"
18664,ARGUMENT.,been closed beneath my eyelids from the time when my son lost his life
18665,ARGUMENT.,"by thy hands; but I ever lament and cherish many woes, rolling in the"
18666,ARGUMENT.,"dust within the enclosures of my palaces. But now I have tasted food,"
18667,ARGUMENT.,and poured sweet wine down my throat; for before indeed I had not
18668,ARGUMENT.,tasted it.”
18669,ARGUMENT.,
18670,ARGUMENT.,"He spoke; but Achilles ordered his companions, servants, and maids, to"
18671,ARGUMENT.,"place couches beneath the porch, and to spread beautiful purple mats on"
18672,ARGUMENT.,"them, and to strew embroidered carpets over them, and to lay on them"
18673,ARGUMENT.,"well-napped cloaks, to be drawn over all. But they went out of the"
18674,ARGUMENT.,"hall, having a torch in their hands, and hastening, they quickly spread"
18675,ARGUMENT.,"two couches. But the swift-footed Achilles, jocularly addressing him,"
18676,ARGUMENT.,798 said:
18677,ARGUMENT.,
18678,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 798: (return)  “Achilles, in a mood partly jocular and partly"
18679,ARGUMENT.,"serious, reminds Priam of the real circumstances of his situation, not"
18680,ARGUMENT.,"for the sake of alarming him, but of accounting for his choosing the"
18681,ARGUMENT.,place he did for the couch of the aged king.”—Kennedy.
18682,ARGUMENT.,
18683,ARGUMENT.,"“Do you lie without, O revered old man, lest some counsellor of the"
18684,ARGUMENT.,"Greeks come hither, who, sitting with me, constantly meditate plans, as"
18685,ARGUMENT.,is just. If any of these should see thee in the dark and dangerous
18686,ARGUMENT.,"night, he would forthwith tell Agamemnon, the shepherd of the people,"
18687,ARGUMENT.,and perchance there would be a delay of the redemption of the body. But
18688,ARGUMENT.,"come, tell me this, and tell it accurately: How many days dost thou"
18689,ARGUMENT.,"desire to perform the funeral rites of noble Hector, that I may myself"
18690,ARGUMENT.,"remain quiet so long, and restrain the people?”"
18691,ARGUMENT.,
18692,ARGUMENT.,"But him Priam, the godlike old man, then answered:"
18693,ARGUMENT.,
18694,ARGUMENT.,"“If indeed thou desirest me to celebrate the funeral of noble Hector,"
18695,ARGUMENT.,"thus doing, O Achilles, thou dost surely gratify me. For thou knowest"
18696,ARGUMENT.,"how we are hemmed in within the city, and it is far to carry wood from"
18697,ARGUMENT.,the mountain; and the Trojans greatly dread [to do so]. Nine days
18698,ARGUMENT.,"indeed we would lament him in our halls, but on the tenth would bury"
18699,ARGUMENT.,"him, and the people should feast; but upon the eleventh we would make a"
18700,ARGUMENT.,"tomb to him, and on the twelfth we will fight, if necessary.” But him"
18701,ARGUMENT.,swift-footed Achilles again addressed:
18702,ARGUMENT.,
18703,ARGUMENT.,"“These things shall be to thee, O aged Priam, as thou desirest; for I"
18704,ARGUMENT.,will prevent the fight as long a time as thou desirest.”
18705,ARGUMENT.,
18706,ARGUMENT.,"Thus having spoken, he grasped the right hand of the old man near the"
18707,ARGUMENT.,"wrist, lest he should fear in his mind. They indeed, the herald and"
18708,ARGUMENT.,"Priam, slept there in the porch of the house, having prudent counsels"
18709,ARGUMENT.,in their mind; while Achilles slept in the interior of the well-built
18710,ARGUMENT.,tent; and beside him lay fair-cheeked Brisëis.
18711,ARGUMENT.,
18712,ARGUMENT.,"The other gods indeed and chariot-fighting men slept all night, subdued"
18713,ARGUMENT.,"by gentle slumber; but sleep seized not Mercury, the author of good,"
18714,ARGUMENT.,revolving in his mind how he should convey away king Priam from the
18715,ARGUMENT.,"ships, having escaped the notice of the sacred gate-keeper. Accordingly"
18716,ARGUMENT.,"he stood over his head, and addressed him:"
18717,ARGUMENT.,
18718,ARGUMENT.,"“O aged man, certainly evil is not at all a care to thee, that thou"
18719,ARGUMENT.,"sleepest thus amongst hostile men, after Achilles has suffered thee."
18720,ARGUMENT.,"Now indeed thou hast ransomed thy beloved son, and hast given much; but"
18721,ARGUMENT.,the sons left behind by thee would give three times as many ransoms for
18722,ARGUMENT.,"thee alive, if Agamemnon, the son of Atreus, should know of thy being"
18723,ARGUMENT.,"here, and all the Greeks should know of it.”"
18724,ARGUMENT.,
18725,ARGUMENT.,"Thus he spoke; but the old man feared, and awoke the herald. Then for"
18726,ARGUMENT.,"them Mercury yoked the horses and mules, and quickly drove them himself"
18727,ARGUMENT.,"through the camp, nor did any one perceive. But when they reached the"
18728,ARGUMENT.,"course of the fair-flowing river, eddying Xanthus, which immortal Jove"
18729,ARGUMENT.,"begat, then indeed Mercury went away to lofty Olympus; and"
18730,ARGUMENT.,saffron-robed Morn was diffused over the whole earth. They indeed drove
18731,ARGUMENT.,"the horses towards the city with wailing and lamentation, and the mules"
18732,ARGUMENT.,bore the body; nor did any other of the men and well-girdled women
18733,ARGUMENT.,"previously perceive it; but Cassandra, like unto golden Venus,"
18734,ARGUMENT.,"ascending Pergamus, discovered her dear father standing in the"
18735,ARGUMENT.,"driving-seat, and the city-summoning herald. She beheld him also upon"
18736,ARGUMENT.,"the mules, lying on the litter; then indeed she shrieked, and cried"
18737,ARGUMENT.,aloud throughout the whole city:
18738,ARGUMENT.,
18739,ARGUMENT.,"“O Trojans and Trojan women, going forth, behold Hector, if ever ye"
18740,ARGUMENT.,rejoiced at his returning alive from battle; for he was a great joy to
18741,ARGUMENT.,"the city, and to the whole people.”"
18742,ARGUMENT.,
18743,ARGUMENT.,"Thus she spoke; nor was there any man left in the city, nor woman; for"
18744,ARGUMENT.,"insupportable grief came upon them all, and they met him near the gates"
18745,ARGUMENT.,bringing in the body. But his wife and venerable mother first rushing
18746,ARGUMENT.,"to the well-wheeled chariot, plucked out their hair, touching his head;"
18747,ARGUMENT.,"and the crowd stood around, weeping. And they indeed would have wept"
18748,ARGUMENT.,"the whole day till sunset before the gates, lamenting Hector, had not"
18749,ARGUMENT.,the old man addressed the people from his chariot:
18750,ARGUMENT.,
18751,ARGUMENT.,"“Give way to me, to pass through with the mules; but afterwards shall"
18752,ARGUMENT.,"ye be satiated with weeping, after I shall carry him home.” Thus he"
18753,ARGUMENT.,"spoke; but they stood off, and made way for the chariot. But when they"
18754,ARGUMENT.,"had brought him into the illustrious palace, they laid him upon"
18755,ARGUMENT.,"perforated beds, and placed singers beside him, leaders of the dirges,"
18756,ARGUMENT.,"who indeed sang a mournful ditty, while the women also uttered"
18757,ARGUMENT.,responsive groans. And amongst them white-armed Andromache began the
18758,ARGUMENT.,"lamentation, holding the head of man-slaughtering Hector between her"
18759,ARGUMENT.,hands:
18760,ARGUMENT.,
18761,ARGUMENT.,"“O husband, young in years hast thou died, and hast left me a widow in"
18762,ARGUMENT.,"the palace. And besides, thy son is thus an infant, to whom thou and I,"
18763,ARGUMENT.,"ill-fated, gave birth; nor do I think he will attain to puberty; for"
18764,ARGUMENT.,"before that, this city will be overthrown from its summit. Certainly"
18765,ARGUMENT.,"thou, the protector, art dead, who didst defend its very self, and"
18766,ARGUMENT.,didst protect its venerable wives and infant children; who will soon be
18767,ARGUMENT.,"carried away in the hollow ships, and I indeed amongst them. But thou,"
18768,ARGUMENT.,"O my son, wilt either accompany me, where thou shalt labour unworthy"
18769,ARGUMENT.,"tasks, toiling for a merciless lord; or some one of the Greeks,"
18770,ARGUMENT.,"enraged, seizing thee by the hand, will hurl thee from a tower, to sad"
18771,ARGUMENT.,"destruction; to whom doubtless Hector has slain a brother, or a father,"
18772,ARGUMENT.,or even a son; for by the hands of Hector very many Greeks have grasped
18773,ARGUMENT.,the immense earth with their teeth. For thy father was not gentle in
18774,ARGUMENT.,the sad conflict; wherefore indeed the people lament him throughout the
18775,ARGUMENT.,"city. But thou hast caused unutterable grief and sorrow to thy parents,"
18776,ARGUMENT.,"O Hector, but chiefly to me are bitter sorrows left. For thou didst not"
18777,ARGUMENT.,stretch out thy hands to me from the couch when dying; nor speak any
18778,ARGUMENT.,"prudent word [of solace], which I might for ever remember, shedding"
18779,ARGUMENT.,tears night and day.”
18780,ARGUMENT.,
18781,ARGUMENT.,"Thus she spoke, bewailing; but the women also lamented; and to them in"
18782,ARGUMENT.,turn Hecuba began her vehement lamentation:
18783,ARGUMENT.,
18784,ARGUMENT.,"“O Hector, far of all my sons dearest to my soul, certainly being alive"
18785,ARGUMENT.,"to me, thou wert beloved by the gods, who truly have had a care of"
18786,ARGUMENT.,"thee, even in the destiny of death. For swift-footed Achilles sold 799"
18787,ARGUMENT.,"all my other sons, whomsoever he seized, beyond the unfruitful sea, at"
18788,ARGUMENT.,"Samos, Imbrus, and Lemnos without a harbour. But when he had taken away"
18789,ARGUMENT.,"thy life with his long-bladed spear, he often dragged thee round the"
18790,ARGUMENT.,"tomb of his comrade Patroclus, whom thou slewest; but he did not thus"
18791,ARGUMENT.,"raise him up. But now thou liest, to my sorrow, in the palaces, fresh"
18792,ARGUMENT.,"800 and lately slain like him whom silver-bowed Apollo, attacking, has"
18793,ARGUMENT.,slain with his mild weapons.”
18794,ARGUMENT.,
18795,ARGUMENT.,"Footnote 799: (return)  See Grote, vol. i. p. 399."
18796,ARGUMENT.,
18797,ARGUMENT.,Footnote 800: (return)  See on ver. 419.
18798,ARGUMENT.,
18799,ARGUMENT.,"Thus she spoke, weeping; and aroused a vehement lamentation. But to"
18800,ARGUMENT.,"them Helen then, the third, began her lamentation:"
18801,ARGUMENT.,
18802,ARGUMENT.,"“O Hector, far dearest to my soul of all my brothers-in-law, for"
18803,ARGUMENT.,"godlike Alexander is my husband, he who brought me to Troy:—would that"
18804,ARGUMENT.,I had perished first. But now already this is the twentieth year to me
18805,ARGUMENT.,"from the time when I came from thence, and quitted my native land; yet"
18806,ARGUMENT.,have I never heard from thee a harsh or reproachful word; but if any
18807,ARGUMENT.,"other of my brothers-in-law, or sisters-in-law, or well-attired"
18808,ARGUMENT.,"husband’s brothers’ wives, reproached me in the palaces, or my"
18809,ARGUMENT.,"mother-in-law (for my father-in-law was ever gentle as a father), then"
18810,ARGUMENT.,"thou, admonishing him with words, didst restrain him, both by thy"
18811,ARGUMENT.,"gentleness and thy gentle words. So that, grieved at heart, I bewail at"
18812,ARGUMENT.,"the same time thee and myself, unhappy; for there is not any other in"
18813,ARGUMENT.,wide Troy kind and friendly to me; but all abhor me.”
18814,ARGUMENT.,
18815,ARGUMENT.,"Thus she spoke, weeping; and again the countless throng groaned. And"
18816,ARGUMENT.,aged Priam spoke [this] speech amongst the people:
18817,ARGUMENT.,
18818,ARGUMENT.,"“O Trojans, now bring wood to the city, nor at all fear in your mind a"
18819,ARGUMENT.,"close ambuscade of the Greeks; for Achilles, dismissing me from the"
18820,ARGUMENT.,"dark ships, thus promised me, that he would not commence hostilities,"
18821,ARGUMENT.,before the twelfth morning should arrive.”
18822,ARGUMENT.,
18823,ARGUMENT.,Thus he spoke; and they yoked both oxen and mules beneath the waggons;
18824,ARGUMENT.,and then assembled before the city. For nine days indeed they brought
18825,ARGUMENT.,"together an immense quantity of wood; but when now the tenth morn,"
18826,ARGUMENT.,"bearing light to mortals, had appeared, then indeed, weeping, they"
18827,ARGUMENT.,"carried out noble Hector, and placed the body on the lofty pile, and"
18828,ARGUMENT.,cast in the fire.
18829,ARGUMENT.,
18830,ARGUMENT.,"But when the mother of dawn, rosy-fingered Morn, appeared, then were"
18831,ARGUMENT.,the people assembled round the pile of illustrious Hector. But after
18832,ARGUMENT.,"they were assembled, and collected together, first indeed they"
18833,ARGUMENT.,"extinguished all the pyre with dark wine, as much as the force of the"
18834,ARGUMENT.,fire had possessed; but then his brothers and companions collected his
18835,ARGUMENT.,"white bones, weeping, and the abundant tear streamed down their cheeks."
18836,ARGUMENT.,"And, taking them, they placed them in a golden urn, covering them with"
18837,ARGUMENT.,"soft purple robes, and forthwith deposited it in a hollow grave; and"
18838,ARGUMENT.,then strewed it above with numerous great stones. But they built up the
18839,ARGUMENT.,"tomb in haste, and watches sat around on every side, lest the"
18840,ARGUMENT.,well-greaved Greeks should make an attack too soon. And having heaped
18841,ARGUMENT.,"up the tomb, they returned; and then being assembled together in order,"
18842,ARGUMENT.,"they feasted on a splendid banquet in the palaces of Priam, the"
18843,ARGUMENT.,Jove-nurtured king.
18844,ARGUMENT.,
18845,ARGUMENT.,Thus indeed they performed the funeral of steed-breaking Hector.
