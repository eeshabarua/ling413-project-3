155,I. THE STORY,I. THE STORY
156,I. THE STORY,
157,I. THE STORY,"In order to understand the structure of the _Iliad_, we must keep fast"
158,I. THE STORY,hold of the guiding clue which is supplied by the author in the first
159,I. THE STORY,"line of his poem.  The subject, he tells us, is the _Wrath of"
160,I. THE STORY,"Achilles_.  The motive of the greatest of epics is _wrath_--blind,"
161,I. THE STORY,"unreasoning fury, which knows no law, and acknowledges no right."
162,I. THE STORY,"Keeping this in view, we are able to explain what seems at first sight"
163,I. THE STORY,to be a strange anomaly in the conduct of the story--the absence of the
164,I. THE STORY,hero from the scene of action during three-fourths of the narrative.
165,I. THE STORY,For Achilles is not less the hero of the _Iliad_ than Odysseus is the
166,I. THE STORY,"hero of the _Odyssey_, and in both cases the character of the man"
167,I. THE STORY,"determines the structure of the poem.  Odysseus is a man of middle age,"
168,I. THE STORY,"in the maturity of his splendid powers, with his judgment refined by"
169,I. THE STORY,"experience, and his passions cooled by time.  From the moment when he"
170,I. THE STORY,sets sail from Troy he remains faithful to the fixed desire of his
171,I. THE STORY,"heart.  All the malice of Poseidon, all the spells of Circe, all the"
172,I. THE STORY,"loveliness of Calypso, cannot shake him from his resolve to return to"
173,I. THE STORY,"his home in Ithaca, and live out his life in calm domestic happiness"
174,I. THE STORY,and peace.  Yet he is entirely free from the narrowness which commonly
175,I. THE STORY,belongs to a fixed idea.  He knows the uncertainty which attaches to
176,I. THE STORY,"all human hopes, and is as ready to enjoy the passing hour as the"
177,I. THE STORY,"youngest sailor of his crew.  He has the hungry intellect, which would"
178,I. THE STORY,"fain take all knowledge into its compass, and the spirit of soaring"
179,I. THE STORY,"enterprise, which delights in discovery and daring adventure.  But"
180,I. THE STORY,"above all he has the patient, constant human heart, faithful through"
181,I. THE STORY,all turns of fortune to one sober ideal.  It is this steadfastness of
182,I. THE STORY,purpose and sweet reasonableness in the hero which gives to the
183,I. THE STORY,"narrative of the _Odyssey_ its smooth and pellucid flow, and makes it"
184,I. THE STORY,the most delightful of all story-books.
185,I. THE STORY,
186,I. THE STORY,"Achilles, on the other hand, is the incarnation of the spirit of youth,"
187,I. THE STORY,"with its passionate pride, its acute sensibility, and its absorption in"
188,I. THE STORY,"self.  He is like one of the great forces of nature--unreasoning,"
189,I. THE STORY,"elemental, mighty to create or destroy.  His inaction is as tremendous"
190,I. THE STORY,"as his action.  He is offended, and the Greeks, deprived of his aid,"
191,I. THE STORY,"are brought to the brink of ruin--his friend is slain by Hector, and"
192,I. THE STORY,"the current of his fury, thus directed into a new channel, sweeps the"
193,I. THE STORY,whole Trojan army before it in havoc and rout.
194,I. THE STORY,
195,I. THE STORY,"This, then, is the plan of the _Iliad_--to describe the effects of"
196,I. THE STORY,"Achilles' anger, first on the Greeks, then on the Trojans.  A brief"
197,I. THE STORY,review of the story will show how the plan is worked out.  In the ninth
198,I. THE STORY,"year of the war, the Greeks have taken a small town in the"
199,I. THE STORY,"neighbourhood of Troy, and Agamemnon has received a maiden named"
200,I. THE STORY,"Chryseis as his share of the spoil.  Chryses, the maiden's father,"
201,I. THE STORY,"comes to the Grecian camp to ransom his child, but he is rudely"
202,I. THE STORY,"repulsed by Agamemnon, and invokes the vengeance of Apollo, whose"
203,I. THE STORY,"priest he is, on the Greeks.  Apollo sends a pestilence on the camp,"
204,I. THE STORY,"and Agamemnon is compelled in consequence to restore Chryseis, but he"
205,I. THE STORY,"recompenses himself by seizing another maiden, named Briseis, awarded"
206,I. THE STORY,to Achilles as a prize at the capture of the same city.  Achilles vows
207,I. THE STORY,"vengeance on the whole Greek army for this outrage, and Thetis, his"
208,I. THE STORY,"mother, obtains a promise from Zeus, the supreme god of Olympus, that"
209,I. THE STORY,her son's vow shall be fulfilled to the letter.  Accordingly Zeus sends
210,I. THE STORY,"a false dream to Agamemnon, bidding him lead the whole army against"
211,I. THE STORY,"Troy, with the assurance of a decisive victory.  Agamemnon obeys the"
212,I. THE STORY,"summons in all good faith, and the two armies meet on the plain before"
213,I. THE STORY,"the city.  But just as the general encounter is about to begin, Paris"
214,I. THE STORY,"offers to meet Menelaus in single combat, and a truce is made in order"
215,I. THE STORY,"that the duel may take place.  They fight, and Menelaus is victorious,"
216,I. THE STORY,but Paris is saved from death or capture by the intervention of
217,I. THE STORY,Aphrodite.
218,I. THE STORY,
219,I. THE STORY,Menelaus now claims the fulfilment of the conditions of the truce--the
220,I. THE STORY,restoration of Helen with all her wealth.  But before the point can be
221,I. THE STORY,"debated, Pandarus, a Trojan, at the instigation of Athene, aims an"
222,I. THE STORY,"arrow at Menelaus, and wounds him in the side.  This treacherous act"
223,I. THE STORY,"leads to an immediate renewal of hostilities, and in the battle which"
224,I. THE STORY,follows the Trojans are reduced to such straits by the powers of
225,I. THE STORY,"Diomede that Hector goes on a mission to the city, to institute a"
226,I. THE STORY,"solemn supplication in the temple of Athene, in the vain hope of"
227,I. THE STORY,"diverting her anger from the Trojans.  Having accomplished his errand,"
228,I. THE STORY,"he returns to the field, bringing with him Paris, who, since his defeat"
229,I. THE STORY,"by Menelaus, has been dallying in Helen's bower; and then follows a"
230,I. THE STORY,"duel between Hector and Ajax, in which the Greek champion has the"
231,I. THE STORY,"advantage.  At the suggestion of Nestor, the Greeks fortify their camp"
232,I. THE STORY,with a moat and rampart; and this brings us to the end of the seventh
233,I. THE STORY,book.
234,I. THE STORY,
235,I. THE STORY,Hitherto the Greeks have had a decided advantage in battle with the
236,I. THE STORY,"Trojans, and nothing has been done to carry out the promise which Zeus"
237,I. THE STORY,made to Thetis.  But now the father of gods and men begins to take
238,I. THE STORY,decisive measures to fulfil his pledge; the gods are forbidden to
239,I. THE STORY,"interfere between the rival armies, and in the next day's battle the"
240,I. THE STORY,"Greeks are driven back in panic to their camp, while the Trojans,"
241,I. THE STORY,"contrary to their custom, keep the field all night, intending to attack"
242,I. THE STORY,the Greek stronghold in full force next day.  So despondent are the
243,I. THE STORY,Greeks that an embassy is sent with an offer of magnificent gifts to
244,I. THE STORY,"Achilles, if he will lay aside his anger and come to the help of his"
245,I. THE STORY,"distressed countrymen.  Achilles refuses all compromise, and the rest"
246,I. THE STORY,of the night is occupied by the bold raid undertaken by Diomede and
247,I. THE STORY,Odysseus on the Thracian camp.
248,I. THE STORY,
249,I. THE STORY,At the opening of the eleventh book our attention is concentrated on
250,I. THE STORY,"the valorous exploits of Agamemnon, who is at length compelled to"
251,I. THE STORY,retire by a severe wound in the arm; Diomede is pierced through the
252,I. THE STORY,"foot by an arrow from the bow of Paris, and Odysseus, Machaon, and"
253,I. THE STORY,Eurypylus are also disabled.  Patroclus is sent by Achilles to inquire
254,I. THE STORY,"of Nestor concerning the fortunes of the Greeks, and Nestor then makes"
255,I. THE STORY,the suggestion which marks the turning-point in the first act of the
256,I. THE STORY,"great epic drama: if, he says, Achilles will not go to the field"
257,I. THE STORY,"himself, at least let him send Patroclus to lead the Myrmidons[1]"
258,I. THE STORY,"against the Trojans.  Nothing comes of the proposal for the present,"
259,I. THE STORY,but it is to bear fatal fruit both for Patroclus and Achilles in the
260,I. THE STORY,"near future.  The Greeks are again driven behind their defences, and a"
261,I. THE STORY,"furious struggle ensues, at the end of which the gates of the camp are"
262,I. THE STORY,"demolished, and the Trojans, led by Hector, are on the point of setting"
263,I. THE STORY,fire to the ships.
264,I. THE STORY,
265,I. THE STORY,
266,I. THE STORY,[1] The followers of Achilles
267,I. THE STORY,
268,I. THE STORY,
269,I. THE STORY,"At this moment the attention of Zeus is withdrawn from the battle, and"
270,I. THE STORY,Poseidon seizes the opportunity to interfere in favour of the Greeks.
271,I. THE STORY,"By his influence the scale is turned again, Hector receives fearful"
272,I. THE STORY,"injuries from a huge stone hurled by Ajax, and the Trojans are driven"
273,I. THE STORY,headlong across the plain.  Zeus is lulled to sleep by the contrivance
274,I. THE STORY,"of Hera, and when he awakens it is to find his whole scheme of"
275,I. THE STORY,vengeance on the point of being frustrated.  In great anger he sends a
276,I. THE STORY,"peremptory message to Poseidon to withdraw from the battle, and lays"
277,I. THE STORY,"his commands on Apollo, who brings back Hector, healed and whole, to"
278,I. THE STORY,"the field, and leads the Trojans once more to the assault of the camp."
279,I. THE STORY,"In spite of the desperate valour of Ajax, the Greeks are driven back to"
280,I. THE STORY,"their ships, and the Trojans bring torches, with the intention of"
281,I. THE STORY,burning the whole fleet.
282,I. THE STORY,
283,I. THE STORY,"Then at last Achilles, yielding to the earnest entreaty of Patroclus,"
284,I. THE STORY,"sends him to the aid of the Greeks, equipped in his own armour, and"
285,I. THE STORY,leading the whole force of the Myrmidons.  Patroclus easily drives the
286,I. THE STORY,"Trojans back from the camp, and slays Sarpedon, one of the bravest"
287,I. THE STORY,warriors among the allies of Troy; but he himself falls by Hector's
288,I. THE STORY,"hand, and the armour of Achilles passes into the possession of his"
289,I. THE STORY,"slayer.  A tremendous struggle ensues over the body of Patroclus, which"
290,I. THE STORY,"is only ended by the appearance of Achilles himself, who comes,"
291,I. THE STORY,"attended by strange prodigies, to the wall, and, by the mere terror of"
292,I. THE STORY,"his presence, scares the Trojans from the field, and saves his friend's"
293,I. THE STORY,body from outrage.
294,I. THE STORY,
295,I. THE STORY,The rest of the story may be briefly told.  By the intercession of
296,I. THE STORY,"Thetis, Hephæstus, the divine smith, makes a splendid suit of armour"
297,I. THE STORY,"for Achilles, and, after a solemn scene of reconciliation with"
298,I. THE STORY,"Agamemnon, Achilles leads the Greeks to battle.  The whole torrent of"
299,I. THE STORY,"his fury is now turned upon the Trojans, and, after a wholesale"
300,I. THE STORY,"massacre of lesser victims, he meets Hector in single combat, slays"
301,I. THE STORY,"him, and drags his body behind his chariot to the camp.  The funeral"
302,I. THE STORY,"obsequies of Patroclus are celebrated with great pomp, and then"
303,I. THE STORY,"Achilles, who is possessed by a demon of rage and grief, continues for"
304,I. THE STORY,a space of twelve days to wreak his vengeance on the lifeless body of
305,I. THE STORY,"Hector, which he drags repeatedly behind his car round the tomb of"
306,I. THE STORY,"Patroclus.  The gods interpose to make an end of this senseless fury,"
307,I. THE STORY,"and Hector's body, which has been miraculously preserved from harm, is"
308,I. THE STORY,"restored to Priam, who comes in the night, under the conduct of Hermes,"
309,I. THE STORY,and redeems the corpse with a heavy ransom.  With the burial of Hector
310,I. THE STORY,the poem reaches its conclusion.
311,I. THE STORY,
312,I. THE STORY,"Such, in the briefest and baldest outline, is the story of the _Iliad_."
313,I. THE STORY,Space does not allow us to discuss the various objections which have
314,I. THE STORY,"been raised against some of the details of the narrative, still less to"
315,I. THE STORY,enumerate the reconstructions and mutilations to which the great epic
316,I. THE STORY,has been subjected in the dissecting-room of criticism.  Where opinion
317,I. THE STORY,"is still so much divided, we may be allowed to state our conviction"
318,I. THE STORY,"that the _Iliad_, though wanting the structural perfection of the"
319,I. THE STORY,"_Odyssey_, is one poem, and the work of one master mind."
320,I. THE STORY,
321,I. THE STORY,
322,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS
323,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,
324,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"The gods in the _Iliad_ play a very active and human part, and indeed"
325,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,they may be said in a sense to be more human than the men themselves.
326,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"They are passionate, sensual, vindictive; they have no sense of fair"
327,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"play, but are always ready to help their favourites by all means, fair"
328,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"or foul.  When Patroclus is to die, he is stripped of his armour and"
329,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"beaten half senseless by Apollo, and delivered over in this helpless"
330,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"state to Euphorbus and Hector; and Hector, in his turn, is cheated and"
331,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,beguiled to his death by Athene.  In the chariot race which is
332,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,described in the twenty-third book Athene wrecks the car of Eumelus to
333,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,secure the victory for Diomede; and the same goddess interferes in the
334,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"foot race on behalf of Odysseus, whom she loves like a mother.  We have"
335,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"already remarked, in the Introduction to the _Odyssey_, that the only"
336,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,humorous scenes in the _Iliad_ are those in which the gods play the
337,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"chief or sole part.  And, in fact, the want of dignity and decorum"
338,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,which we find in these mighty beings is simply astonishing.  The battle
339,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"of the gods, which is introduced with such pomp and parade, ends in the"
340,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"broadest farce.  In the fifth book, Ares roars and bellows like a beast"
341,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"when he is wounded by the spear of Diomede, and Aphrodite, whose hand"
342,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"has been scratched, goes whimpering and whining to her mother for"
343,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,comfort.  Only in a few passages do we find a great and worthy
344,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,conception of the divine nature--as in the famous lines in the first
345,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"book, when Zeus nods his immortal head confirming his oath to Thetis,"
346,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,and in the sublime description of Poseidon at the beginning of the
347,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,thirteenth book.
348,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,
349,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"At the head of the Olympian hierarchy stands Zeus the lord of the sky,"
350,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"who divides with his brothers, Hades and Poseidon, the empire of the"
351,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"universe.  He is the highest in power and authority, and with him rests"
352,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,the final decision in all the disputes of Olympus.  But this genial and
353,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,patriarchal deity is not without his troubles: he rules over a
354,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"disorderly household, and his purposes are constantly thwarted by the"
355,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,lesser powers who reign under him.  In his heart of hearts he favours
356,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"Priam and the Trojans, but he is a fond and indulgent father and"
357,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"husband, and Hera, his wife, and Athene, his daughter, cherish an"
358,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,implacable hatred against Troy and all things Trojan.  The reason for
359,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"this bitter animosity does not appear: for the judgment of Paris, which"
360,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"is the cause assigned by later legends, is only mentioned in one"
361,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"passage, of doubtful authenticity.  Hera is described as a lady of"
362,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"shrewish and vixenish temper; she will never be satisfied, says Zeus,"
363,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,until she has gone down into Troy and eaten Priam and all his people
364,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"raw!  Her human counterpart is Hecuba, who would like, she says, to"
365,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"tear out the heart of Achilles, and devour it.  On the side of the"
366,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"Trojans are Apollo, Artemis, Hephæstus, the river-god Scamander, and"
367,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,Leto.
368,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,
369,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"Such are the gods of Homer, and such the national divinities of Greece."
370,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"For the poems of Homer and Hesiod, as Herodotus informs us, are the"
371,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"chief sources of the popular theology.  Small wonder, then, that the"
372,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,more earnest minds of a later age were much occupied by the endeavour
373,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"to raise and purify the accepted mythology, or that Plato excludes"
374,II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS,"Homer, ""the great magician,"" from his scheme of reformed education."

378,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,
379,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"Of Achilles and Odysseus we have already spoken at some length, so that"
380,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,we have only to notice briefly the other chief characters.  At the head
381,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"of the Greek army stands Agamemnon, whose authority rests on his"

384,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,place among the warriors of Greece.  A certain strain of weakness runs
385,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"through his character.  He is jealous of his authority, and somewhat"
386,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"covetous, and at moments of crisis and peril he is always foremost in"
387,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"the counsels of despair.  Next to him in rank comes Menelaus, his"
388,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"brother, an amiable but somewhat feeble prince, to whom the poet shows"
389,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"a certain playful tenderness, such as is felt by chivalrous natures"

392,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"The most knightly figure on the Greek side is the young Diomede, whose"
393,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,wonderful exploits fill so large a space in the earlier part of the
394,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,poem.  His gallant and buoyant spirit shines brightest when the
395,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,fortunes of the Greeks are at their lowest ebb; and the beautiful
396,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,episode of his meeting with Glaucus on the battlefield is a rare

401,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,chief bulwark of the Greeks against the impetuous valour of Hector.  In
402,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"character, he is modest and unassuming; he lacks the brilliant"
403,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"qualities of Achilles, though equal to him in sheer physical force.  He"
404,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"is the type of the rugged soldier, such as we find among the Spartans"
405,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"of a later date, loyal to his prince, a faithful comrade, ever at the"
406,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"post of danger, ever prompt to help where the need is sorest.  His"
407,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"plain, frank nature views with contempt the fantastic pride of"
408,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"Achilles, whose frightful egoism, and indifference to the sufferings of"
409,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"his countrymen, revolt and disgust him."

416,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"between Agamemnon and Achilles; in spite of his eighty years, he still"
417,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"takes the field and fights in the van, though his arm is now of less"
418,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"value than his head.  With regard to his eloquence, it can hardly be"
419,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"said, judging by the specimen preserved, that he is quite worthy of his"
420,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"reputation.  He is, in fact, garrulous, rambling, and tedious--though"
421,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"in these qualities he is even surpassed by the aged Ph[oe]nix, who has"
422,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"played the part of male nurse to Achilles, and excels in a style of"
423,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,oratory dear to the professional guardians of childhood.

425,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"The great champion of the Trojans is Hector, the son of Priam and"
426,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"Hecuba.  His character is, in every respect, a contrast to that of"
427,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"Achilles.  With him the claims of king and country ever come first,"
428,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,though he is not indifferent to personal distinction.  He falls very
429,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,far short of the ideal knight--without fear and without reproach.  In
430,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"these qualities he seems to be eclipsed by Glaucus and Sarpedon, the"
431,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"princes of Lycia, whose beautiful friendship finds its most illustrious"
432,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"record in the immortal lines of the twelfth book,[2] the finest"
433,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,exposition in the world of the principle involved in the words
434,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"_noblesse oblige_.  Hector, on the other hand, is full of weakness: at"
435,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"one time he is faint-hearted, and has to be recalled to the duties of"
436,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,his great position by the reproaches of those who serve under him; at
437,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"another time he is overbold, and his rashness brings upon the Trojans"
438,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"overwhelming disaster.  Yet with all this, his character is full of"
439,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,interest.  In his greater moments he rises to sublime heights of
440,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"heroism.  He does not shrink from the consequences of his actions, but"
441,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,goes to certain death with the spirit of a patriot and martyr.  He is
442,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,"the mirror of knightly courtesy, kind and gentle even to the guilty and"
443,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,the fallen; and his last meeting with Andromache is hardly to be
444,III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS,matched for beauty and pathos in all literature.

459,IV. THE SIMILES,"One word must be added on the frequent comparisons, or similes, which"
460,IV. THE SIMILES,form one of the most characteristic features of the poem.  At least
461,IV. THE SIMILES,"half the _Iliad_ is occupied with descriptions of battle, and Homeric"
462,IV. THE SIMILES,"warfare is exceedingly simple and uniform, consisting almost entirely"
463,IV. THE SIMILES,"of single combats between individual chieftains, or wholesale slaughter"
464,IV. THE SIMILES,wrought by some puissant arm on the promiscuous herd of soldiers.  To
465,IV. THE SIMILES,render so unpromising a theme interesting and attractive must have
466,IV. THE SIMILES,taxed the skill and invention of the poet to their utmost limit; and
467,IV. THE SIMILES,his principal resources for attaining this end is in the lavish use of
468,IV. THE SIMILES,the simile.  In those parts of the poem where much is to be told in
469,IV. THE SIMILES,"little space this ornament occurs rarely, or not at all.  In the first"
470,IV. THE SIMILES,"book, which is crowded with incidents, not a single simile is used."
471,IV. THE SIMILES,"But where the action is to be delayed or elaborated, and especially in"
472,IV. THE SIMILES,"the battle pieces, the similes are flung broadcast, shining like stars"
473,IV. THE SIMILES,"among the racing clouds of a stormy sky.  Every corner of nature, and"
474,IV. THE SIMILES,"every province of human life, are ransacked to furnish illustrations of"
475,IV. THE SIMILES,"the eternal drama of ""battle, and murder, and sudden death.""  In a"
476,IV. THE SIMILES,moment we are rapt by the magic of the poet from the steam and squalor
477,IV. THE SIMILES,"of slaughter to some busy scene of human industry, or some living"
478,IV. THE SIMILES,"picture, grand, lovely, or terrible, drawn from the great panorama of"
479,IV. THE SIMILES,"nature.  Nothing is too great, nothing too little, to furnish material"
480,IV. THE SIMILES,for this splendid treasury of poetry.  It would be easy to discourse
481,IV. THE SIMILES,for pages on this fascinating subject; but we must content ourselves
482,IV. THE SIMILES,"with the above brief hint, and will conclude our remarks by declaring"
483,IV. THE SIMILES,our full agreement with those who regard the similes in the _Iliad_ as
484,IV. THE SIMILES,the chief glory and beauty in the first and greatest of epic poems.

498,I,The scene of our story is laid in the north-western corner of Asia
499,I,"Minor, where the blue waters of the Hellespont mingle with the waves of"
500,I,"the Ægæan.  The whole coast is lined with a multitude of war galleys,"
501,I,"drawn up, row behind row, for a space of several miles; and behind them"
502,I,"are thousands and thousands of wooden huts, affording shelter to a"
503,I,"whole nation of warriors, with their slaves and followers.  For nine"
504,I,"years the Greeks have lain here encamped, striving in vain to sack the"
505,I,"ancient city of Troy, whose towers and battlements, some five miles"
506,I,"distant, can be seen from the elevated parts of the camp.  The whole"
507,I,"surrounding country has been laid waste, and town after town has been"
508,I,visited by all the horrors of war; but the walls of Troy still stand
509,I,"firm against all assault, and the end seems as far off as ever."
510,I,
511,I,"The chiefs are assembled in council, and in their midst sits Agamemnon,"
512,I,"the mightiest prince in Greece, whose nod a hundred thousand warriors"
513,I,"obey.  Suddenly, a voice is heard on the outskirts of the crowd which"
514,I,"surrounds the circle of elders, and an aged man, clad in the long"
515,I,"flowing robes of a priest, is led into the royal presence.  In his hand"
516,I,"he carries a rod, adorned with studs of gold, and wreathed with olive"
517,I,"leaves.  ""A boon, great king, a boon!"" he cries, lifting the rod on"
518,I,"high.  ""Speak,"" answers Agamemnon.  ""What wouldst thou have of me?"""
519,I,"""Give me back my child, my daughter Chryseis,"" answers the priest."
520,I,"""Thou hast sacked my city, thou hast burnt my home; restore unto me my"
521,I,"child, and leave me not altogether desolate in mine old age."""
522,I,
523,I,"Dark was the brow of Agamemnon when he heard these words, and short and"
524,I,"stern was his answer.  ""Let me not find thee,"" he said, ""lingering here"
525,I,"in the camp, and come not hither again on such an errand.  Thy daughter"
526,I,"thou shall not see again; she is mine, the captive of my bow and of my"
527,I,"spear, and shall be my slave until the day of her death.""  In vain the"
528,I,"old man urged him with entreaty, and offered a rich ransom to redeem"
529,I,"his child from bondage.  ""Talk not to me of ransom,"" answered"
530,I,"Agamemnon: ""not all the gold of thy temple shall purchase liberty for"
531,I,"the maiden, for she hath found favour in my sight.  Get thee gone at"
532,I,"once, and provoke me no further."""
533,I,
534,I,"Then the priest, whose name was Chryses, feared for his own life, and"
535,I,fled from the angry face of the King.  Down to the margin of the sea he
536,I,"went, and gazing with tear-dimmed eyes over the heaving waters, thus he"
537,I,"prayed to Apollo, his protector and lord: ""Hear me, god of the silver"
538,I,"bow, whose altar steams day and night with offerings from the choicest"
539,I,"of the flock.  Remember my faithful service, and let thine arrows"
540,I,"avenge my tears on the Greeks."""
541,I,
542,I,"So he prayed, and Apollo heard him, and down from the peaks of Olympus"
543,I,"he sped.  In his hand he bare his mighty bow, and the arrows in his"
544,I,"quiver made an angry rattling as he swooped down on the Grecian camp,"
545,I,"swift and sudden as the southern night.  He took his stand on a hill,"
546,I,and loosed an arrow from the string; and dire was the twang of the
547,I,"silver bow.  First, he sent his shafts among the dogs and mules; then"
548,I,"he changed his aim, and rained destruction among the men; and the whole"
549,I,place was filled with the smoke of funeral pyres.
550,I,
551,I,"For nine days the deadly shower fell without ceasing; but on the tenth,"
552,I,"Achilles summoned a general gathering of the host, to inquire into the"
553,I,causes of the calamity which had fallen on his countrymen.  The chiefs
554,I,"met in full conclave, and about them were gathered the meaner sort in"
555,I,their tens of thousands.  When the clamorous cries of the multitude
556,I,"were stilled, Achilles rose in his place, and addressing himself"
557,I,"directly to Agamemnon said: ""Son of Atreus, how long wilt thou suffer"
558,I,thy people to perish?  Is it not enough that our blood is poured forth
559,I,"every day in battle with thy foes, but must pestilence also make havoc"
560,I,"among our ranks?  This is Apollo's work, and it is time to ask some"
561,I,"priest or soothsayer how we have offended the god, that we may appease"
562,I,"his anger with the fat of goats and lambs, and save ourselves from"
563,I,"further harm."""
564,I,
565,I,"Among the elders sat Calchas, the chief seer of the Greeks; who knew"
566,I,"all things--what was, and had been, and was to come--and was the chosen"
567,I,leader of the army in matters of religion.  Seeing all eyes turned upon
568,I,"him he stood up and answered the challenge of Achilles, though with"
569,I,manifest reluctance and constraint.
570,I,
571,I,"""Illustrious chieftain,"" he said, ""thou hast asked the cause of"
572,I,"Apollo's anger, and I know that thou lookest to me for an answer.  But"
573,I,swear unto me first that thou wilt defend me in word and in deed; for I
574,I,"fear that, by revealing the counsels of the god whom I serve, I shall"
575,I,"offend one who is the greatest and mightiest among us."""
576,I,
577,I,"""Tell us what thou knowest, and fear nothing,"" answered Achilles;"
578,I,"""while I live no one shall lift his hand against thee, no, not"
579,I,"Agamemnon himself."""
580,I,
581,I,"Thus encouraged, Calchas spoke out, and declared that the only means of"
582,I,"staying the pestilence was by sending back Chryseis to her father,"
583,I,"without price or ransom, and offering a costly sacrifice of atonement"
584,I,to Apollo in his temple at Chrysa.  It was not without reason that the
585,I,prudent seer had appealed to Achilles for protection; for no sooner had
586,I,"his words been uttered than Agamemnon sprang from his seat, with fury"
587,I,"in his looks, and overwhelmed the prophet with a torrent of reproaches."
588,I,"""Ill fare thy prophecies, thou prophet of ill!"" he cried.  ""Not one"
589,I,good word have I ever heard from thy lips; but this is the worst that
590,I,ever thou hast spoken.  Hard and bitter is the charge which thou hast
591,I,"laid upon me, bidding me restore this maiden, fairer and dearer to me"
592,I,"than Clytæmnestra, my wedded wife.  Nevertheless I will send her back,"
593,I,"if I cannot save my people otherwise; but look ye to it, princes and"
594,I,"councillors of Greece, that I find fit recompense for my loss; for she"
595,I,"was a choice prize of war, set apart for me as a gift of privilege and"
596,I,"honour."""
597,I,
598,I,"""And thinkest thou,"" said Achilles, roused at once to opposition by"
599,I,"this unwarrantable claim, ""that it befits thine honour as a king to be"
600,I,"covetous of thy people's goods?  Be generous; let thy prize go, and"
601,I,when next we divide the spoil of a captured town we will repay thee
602,I,"threefold and fourfold for thy loss."""
603,I,
604,I,"""Payment I will have, and that right speedily,"" answered Agamemnon,"
605,I,"with darkening brow.  ""See that ye find means to fill the place of this"
606,I,"maiden, or one of you shall yield up his prize to me, whether it be"
607,I,"Ajax, or Odysseus, or thou Achilles, who art so bold of speech, that"
608,I,thou mayest learn that I am king indeed.  But concerning this we can
609,I,speak again hereafter; our present task is to restore Chryseis to her
610,I,"father, and appease the god with sacrifice."""
611,I,
612,I,Agamemnon thought perhaps by his last words to avert the anger of the
613,I,"fiery young prince, whose eyes flashed fire when he heard the King's"
614,I,threat.  But if such was his purpose it failed altogether.  No sooner
615,I,had he ended than the full tempest of Achilles' wrath fell upon his
616,I,"head.  ""Thou soul of avarice!"" he cried, ""clad in shamelessness as with"
617,I,"a garment, was it for thee that we crossed all those weary leagues of"
618,I,water to make war on the men of Troy?  I have no quarrel with the
619,I,"Trojans; they have not lifted my cattle, or driven off my horses, for"
620,I,"my home is far beyond their reach, divided from Asia by shadowy"
621,I,"mountains and sounding seas.  For thee, thou dog, and for thy brother"
622,I,"have I toiled, and in the division of the spoil 'tis but little that I"
623,I,win as the price of my sweat and my blood; and thou seekest to rob me
624,I,"of that little, to add to thine own monstrous hoard.  I will go back"
625,I,"forthwith to my native land of Phthia, for I have no mind to abide here"
626,I,"in dishonour and heap up treasure for thee."""
627,I,
628,I,"""Go when thou wilt,"" answered Agamemnon, in scornful tones.  ""Heaven"
629,I,forbid that I should hinder thee!  Most hateful to me art thou of all
630,I,"the chivalry of Greece, for thou hast a heart full of hatred and"
631,I,"malice.  Go and lord it over thine own tribe; I am the master here, and"
632,I,"as sure as I am a crowned and anointed king I will take thy prize, even"
633,I,"the maiden Briseis, and lead her to my tent, that thou mayest learn to"
634,I,"curb thy saucy tongue in the presence of thy lord."""
635,I,
636,I,"Thus publicly insulted and defied, Achilles sat speechless with rage,"
637,I,fighting against the passion which shook his mighty frame.  At last it
638,I,seemed that he had resolved to let his fury have full scope; slowly he
639,I,"drew his sword from its scabbard, his mouth was opened for the battle"
640,I,"cry, and in another moment the haughty King would have lain weltering"
641,I,in his blood; but in the very act of springing on his foe he felt
642,I,"himself restrained from behind, and turning to confront this new"
643,I,assailant he stood face to face with the goddess Athene.  Unseen and
644,I,"unheard by the rest, the grey-eyed goddess spoke, bidding him to desist"
645,I,"from his murderous purpose.  ""Put up thy sword,"" she said; ""speak"
646,I,"daggers to him, if thou wilt, but use none.  Thine honour is safe in"
647,I,"the hands of Zeus, and the day of reckoning shall come, when that proud"
648,I,"head shall be humbled to the very dust before thee."""
649,I,
650,I,To those who were looking on it seemed that Achilles had fallen into a
651,I,"sudden trance of thought, from which he started abruptly, and,"
652,I,"thrusting back his sword into its sheath, resumed the war of words with"
653,I,"Agamemnon.  ""Thou drunkard,"" he cried, ""with eye of dog and heart of"
654,I,"deer, foremost in the revel and last in the fray!  Thou of the itching"
655,I,"palm, who lovest the chink of stolen gold, but turnest pale at the"
656,I,"clash of steel!  False shepherd, that devourest thy flock!  Cowardly"
657,I,"master of cowardly sheep!  Now by this sceptre I swear, by this symbol"
658,I,of justice which the elders hold in their hands when they give judgment
659,I,"before the people, the day is not far distant when all this host shall"
660,I,"be filled with longing for me, to save them from Hector's destroying"
661,I,"arm, when their bravest and their strongest are falling beneath his"
662,I,"spear.  Then shalt thou learn thy folly too late, and drink to the"
663,I,"dregs the bitter cup which thou hast filled for me."""
664,I,
665,I,"With that he flung the sceptre at Agamemnon's feet, and sat down again"
666,I,"in his place.  Then arose Nestor, the clear-voiced orator of Pylos,"
667,I,from whose lips flowed eloquence sweeter than honey.  Two generations
668,I,"of men had lived and died since his birth, and he still dwelt in kingly"
669,I,"honour among the third.  And thus he spake, striving to make peace"
670,I,"between the two angry chieftains: ""Alas! what sorrow has come upon the"
671,I,"sons of Greece!--sorrow to us, but joy unto Priam and the sons of"
672,I,"Priam, when they hear of the feud which hath arisen between ye twain."
673,I,"Be guided by me; I am older than ye, and before ye were born I moved as"
674,I,"an equal among heroes mightier than ye, and was second to none in"
675,I,"council and in fight.  Hearken therefore to me, even as they did.  Seek"
676,I,"not, Agamemnon, to take from Achilles his prize of honour; and thou,"
677,I,"Achilles, provoke not the King to anger by thy bitter words, for as"
678,I,"thou art our bulwark in war, so he sits higher than thou in sceptred"
679,I,"majesty."""
680,I,
681,I,"""Thou sayest well,"" answered Agamemnon, ""but this man's insolence is"
682,I,not to be borne.  Because he is a stout spearman he thinks that he can
683,I,lord it over us all.  But there are some here who will not brook his
684,I,"tyranny."""
685,I,
686,I,"""There is one here,"" retorted Achilles, ""who refuses to be thy slave."
687,I,But enough of this--I will waste no more words on thee.  Come and take
688,I,"away my prize, if those who stand here suffer thee to do this wrong;"
689,I,"but touch not aught else of my possessions, or thy blood shall pay the"
690,I,"price."""
691,I,
692,I,"With these words the stormy debate, so fruitful in disaster to the"

697,II,
698,II,"Agamemnon's first task, when he returned to his tent, was to send back"
699,II,"Chryseis, under the charge of Odysseus, to her father.  This done, he"
700,II,"at once took steps to secure possession of Briseis, the captive maiden"
701,II,who had been bestowed on Achilles as his prize of honour.  Talthybius
702,II,"and Eurybates, the royal heralds, were sent to the quarters of Achilles"
703,II,"to demand the surrender of Briseis.  ""And if he will not give her up to"
704,II,"you,"" added the King, ""I will come myself and take her by force.""  So"
705,II,they went with slow and reluctant steps on their thankless errand; and
706,II,"they found Achilles sitting alone by his ship, where it was drawn up on"
707,II,the beach.  Awestruck and silent they stood in the presence of that
708,II,"great chief, unable to utter a sound; but he knew full well why they"
709,II,"had come, and greeted them with courtesy and kindness.  ""Draw near,"" he"
710,II,"said, ""and fear nothing from me.  I respect your office, and impute not"
711,II,to you your master's guilt.  Patroclus my comrade shall deliver unto
712,II,"you the maiden, and be ye my witnesses in this matter, when it is asked"
713,II,why I threw down my sword and refused to fight any longer in
714,II,"Agamemnon's cause."""
715,II,
716,II,"So saying he summoned Patroclus, and bade him bring forth Briseis from"
717,II,"the tent; and Patroclus went, and presently returned, leading the"
718,II,"weeping maiden by the hand, and gave her in charge of the heralds."
719,II,"When they were gone, Achilles wandered away by the margin of the sea,"
720,II,"nursing his wounded spirit, and full of angry and bitter thoughts."
721,II,"Presently he came to a stand, and, stretching out his hands towards the"

724,II,promised me honour from the hands of Zeus.  But now is mine honour
725,II,"turned to infamy, and I am become a very scorn of men, and an outcast"
726,II,"among the people.""  His words were broken by sobs and tears, for he was"
727,II,"but a boy in years, and was smarting with an agony of wounded pride."
728,II,And his mother heard him where she sat in her crystal cave in the
729,II,"depths of the sea; for she was a goddess, and daughter of the sea-god,"
730,II,"Nereus.  Swiftly she rose, ""like an exhalation,"" to the surface of the"
731,II,"sea, and came and stood by her young hero's side.  ""Why weepest thou,"
732,II,"my child?"" she asked, with a tender caress.  ""Tell thy mother all thy"
733,II,"pain, that she may bear the burden with thee."""
734,II,
735,II,"""Thou knowest full well,"" replied Achilles, with a groan; ""what boots"
736,II,"it to repeat to thee the story of my shame?""  Nevertheless he went on"
737,II,to pour out all the tale of injury and outrage; for sorrow grows
738,II,"lighter in the telling.  ""Thou alone,"" he added, when he had finished"
739,II,"the recital, ""canst heal this deadly hurt to mine honour.  I have often"
740,II,"heard thee boast of an old service rendered to Zeus, when the other"
741,II,"Olympians rose up in revolt against him, and he was in sore straits."
742,II,"Go, therefore, to Olympus, and remind him of the debt which he owes"
743,II,"unto thee, and ask him in requital to lend aid to the Trojans, that the"
744,II,"Greeks may be hurled back in rout upon their ships, and Agamemnon may"
745,II,learn what it means to deal despitefully with the best warrior in his
746,II,"camp."""
747,II,
748,II,"""It shall be done as thou sayest,"" answered Thetis; ""Leave everything"
749,II,"in my hands, and thou shalt have atonement in full measure.  Until"
750,II,"twelve days are passed I can do nothing, for Zeus has gone on a far"
751,II,"journey, to partake of a banquet in the land of the Ethiopians.  When"
752,II,he returns I will lay thy case before him; and meanwhile sit thou idle
753,II,"here, and go not into battle, but leave me to champion thy cause."""
754,II,"With this promise she left him, and he sat down to digest his anger,"
755,II,and wait for the day of redress.
756,II,
757,II,
758,III,III
759,III,
760,III,On the dawn of the twelfth day Thetis rose again from her cavern into
761,III,"mid-air, and was borne by the breezes unto Olympus.  She found the lord"
762,III,"of heaven sitting apart on the topmost peak of the mountain, and"
763,III,kneeling before him she preferred her request.  When Zeus heard what
764,III,"she desired he fell into a muse, and answered not a word; but Thetis"
765,III,"remained kneeling at his feet, and, clinging to him with both hands,"
766,III,"repeated her prayer.  Being urged thus with importunity, at last the"
767,III,"sire opened his mouth, and answered in heavy tones: ""Thou wilt put"
768,III,"enmity between me and Hera, my wife; already she upbraids me for"
769,III,"showing favour to the Trojans, and thou askest me to take sides openly"
770,III,"with them against the Greeks.  But go to, what care I for the wrath of"
771,III,"Hera?  Nevertheless, get thee gone speedily, lest she find us together."
772,III,"Howbeit, thou shalt have thy wish; behold, I swear it, and confirm it"
773,III,"with my nod, and whatsoever I have thus confirmed cannot be annulled or"
774,III,"unfulfilled."""
775,III,
776,III,"Thereupon the monarch of the sky bowed his immortal head, with all its"
777,III,"dark and waving locks, and shook the mountain to its base."
778,III,
779,III,"Having thus attained her purpose, Thetis departed, and as soon as she"
780,III,was gone Zeus joined the assembly of the gods in the high palace of
781,III,Olympus.  All the gods rose from their seats to pay him homage as he
782,III,entered and took his place on the royal throne.  But the sharp eyes of
783,III,"Hera had spied out his conference with Thetis, and forthwith she"
784,III,"assailed her indulgent lord in mocking tones: ""What plot hast thou been"
785,III,"hatching now, thou god of craft?  I know that thou art keeping some"
786,III,"mischief from me, thy lawful wife."""
787,III,
788,III,"""Daughter of Cronos,"" answered Zeus, avoiding her piercing glance,"
789,III,"""thou canst not expect that I should share all my counsels with thee."
790,III,Whatever it is meet for thee to know thou shall learn; but I have some
791,III,"secrets which are not for thy ear."""
792,III,
793,III,"""Thou must keep thy secrets more carefully,"" said Hera, with a bitter"
794,III,"smile, ""if thou wouldst deceive me.  Listen, ye gods, while I tell you"
795,III,this fine secret!  Zeus has promised Thetis that the Greeks shall
796,III,"suffer defeat, to avenge the insult put upon her son."""
797,III,
798,III,"""And if such be my will, who shall say me nay?"" replied Zeus, with a"
799,III,"stern look.  ""I warn thee not to thwart my purpose, or all the gods who"
800,III,"sit here shall not save thee from chastisement."""
801,III,
802,III,"Then fear fell upon Hera, and she sat biting her lips, venturing no"
803,III,"reply.  And all the gods sat silent, glancing anxiously at one another,"
804,III,when they heard the angry tones of the Olympian sire.
805,III,
806,III,"At last Hephæstus, the lame god of fire, came to his mother's relief."
807,III,"Rising from his seat, he took a goblet of nectar from the hands of"
808,III,"Hebe, who was serving drink to the gods, and went hobbling to the place"
809,III,"where Hera sat.  ""Mother mine,"" said, he, as he offered her the cup, ""I"
810,III,"counsel thee to give way, and not provoke our father to anger.  Shall"
811,III,"we, the sons and daughters of heaven, brawl over our cups for the sake"
812,III,of miserable mortals?  Let Zeus have his way--for what can we do
813,III,against him?  Hast thou forgotten how he served me when I presumed to
814,III,"stand between thee and his ire?--how he caught me by the foot, and"
815,III,"flung me forth from the open portals of Olympus, as a boy slings a"
816,III,"stone?  From morn till eve I fell, and at the setting of the sun I"
817,III,"struck on Lemnos, the Ægæan isle."""
818,III,
819,III,Hera smiled at her ungainly son; and when she had drunk of the nectar
820,III,"he took the cup, and went limping round the circle of the gods,"
821,III,"offering them to drink.  And all the immortals laughed loud and long,"
822,III,"to see the huge, hairy god engaged in the office of the lovely Hebe."
823,III,"Then music and song came to crown the banquet, as Apollo led the choir"
824,III,of the Muses on his golden harp.

829,III,The Dream: The Muster of Greeks
830,III,
831,I,I
832,I,
833,I,"Agamemnon lay sleeping in his tent, and in a dream he saw Nestor, the"
834,I,"son of Neleus, who addressed him in these words: ""Sleepest thou, son of"
835,I,"Atreus?  It is not meet that thou, on whom lies the weight of a mighty"
836,I,"monarchy, shouldst slumber all night long.  Hearken now to my words: I"
837,I,"am the bearer of a message from Zeus, who bids thee summon the whole"
838,I,"host of Greeks, and lead them against Troy.  Her hour is come at last,"
839,I,"and the gods with one consent have decided that she shall fall."""
840,I,
841,I,"Agamemnon awoke, and behold it was a dream.  But the words had sunk"
842,I,"deep into his heart, and he deemed that the vision had spoken truth."
843,I,"In that vain belief he arose from his couch, clothed himself in a fair"
844,I,"linen tunic and a woollen robe, and, taking his sceptre in his hand,"
845,I,went to rouse Nestor and tell him his dream.  Then the whole body of
846,I,"the chiefs met in council, and the heralds were sent round to proclaim"
847,I,a general assembly of the army.  The people came flocking at the
848,I,"summons, numberless as bees which hover round the flowers in spring;"
849,I,"and nine heralds went about among the multitude, marshalling the"
850,I,"clamorous commons in their places, and commanding silence, that the"
851,I,counsel of the King might be heard.
852,I,
853,I,"As this was a great occasion, it had been resolved, in the private"
854,I,"meeting of the elders, to try the temper of the people before"
855,I,"disclosing to them the real purpose of their leaders.  Accordingly,"
856,I,"when silence had been obtained, Agamemnon rose up in his place, holding"
857,I,"in his hand his ancestral sceptre, the symbol of his great office,"
858,I,"which had descended from father to son since the days of Pelops, the"
859,I,founder of the royal house of Argos.  Planting the sceptre firmly
860,I,"before him, and leaning upon it, thus spake the King, to prove the"
861,I,heart of his people.
862,I,
863,I,"""Friends and comrades in war, I have heavy news to tell you.  Zeus"
864,I,brought us hither under a solemn promise that in the end we should take
865,I,"the sacred city of Priam.  But now he hath revoked his promise, and"
866,I,"bids us sail back to Greece, for all our toil is vain.  Shame and"
867,I,"dishonour must be our portion, now and hereafter, when our sons' sons"
868,I,"shall hear how we, the embattled host of Greece, outnumbering the"
869,I,"citizens of Troy by ten to one, fought against them for nine long"
870,I,"years, and then departed, as beaten and broken men.  But such is the"
871,I,"will of Zeus, and none can gainsay it.  Therefore I bid you hoist sail"
872,I,"and away, for we are not destined to take the town of Troy."""
873,I,
874,I,At these words of the King there arose a wild commotion among his
875,I,"hearers, and the vast multitude swayed to and fro like the waves of the"
876,I,"Ægæan driven this way and that by shifting gusts of wind.  Then, as a"
877,I,"wide field of corn bends down before the strong breath of the west, the"
878,I,"whole host turned seaward, and with a mighty shout they rushed downward"
879,I,"to the shore, and began to launch their ships."
880,I,
881,I,"Agamemnon, and those who were in his confidence, were thunderstruck by"
882,I,"the tremendous effect of his speech, and stood helpless and amazed in"
883,I,the midst of this scene of tumult.  The first to recover himself was
884,I,"Odysseus, the wisest and the firmest spirit among all the chieftains."
885,I,"Flinging off his mantle he went to Agamemnon, and took from his hand"
886,I,the royal sceptre.  Armed with this symbol of authority he hurried
887,I,"hither and thither among the excited throng, urging each man by threats"
888,I,"or entreaties to return to the place of assembly, and wait there for"
889,I,further instructions from the recognised leaders of the host.
890,I,
891,I,"To those of rank and character he spoke courteously, urging them to use"
892,I,"their influence among their followers, and check the general flight;"
893,I,"while with the baser sort he used rougher means of persuasion, striking"
894,I,them with the sceptre and rebuking them fiercely.  Others among the
895,I,"chiefs followed his example, and at length the tumult was stayed, and"
896,I,the fickle mob swept back into the camp with a roar like the billows
897,I,breaking on a long line of rocky shore.
898,I,
899,I,"[Illustration: Paris.  Vatican, Rome.  Photo Anderson]"
900,I,
901,I,"At length that vast audience was seated, and waiting attentively to"
902,I,"hear the counsels of the King.  But one unruly knave remained standing,"
903,I,and poured out a torrent of abuse against Agamemnon and the other
904,I,"chiefs.  This fellow's name was Thersites, and of all the Greeks who"
905,I,"came up against Troy he was the foulest, both in aspect and in speech."
906,I,"His huge misshapen head, sparsely covered with thin, downy hair, sat"
907,I,"awry on his stooping shoulders.  He was bandy-legged, and lame of one"
908,I,"foot.  And he was the sworn enemy of the valiant, the noble, and the"
909,I,wise.  This low-born railer now began to shriek out insults in a
910,I,"hideous voice against Agamemnon, his sovereign lord.  ""Son of Atreus,"""
911,I,"he bawled, ""what lackest thou yet?  Thy tents are full of gold, and"
912,I,"crowded with slaves, which we have won for thee with our swords and our"
913,I,"spears.  Lustest thou yet after more gold, the ransom of Trojan"
914,I,captives?  Or dost thou want more Trojan dames to be thy handmaids?
915,I,"Up, sirs, let us be gone, lest we be called women, and not men, if we"
916,I,remain here to heap up riches for this greedy tyrant.  Have we not seen
917,I,"him put public dishonour on our bravest warrior, taking from him his"
918,I,"lawful prize?  Surely Achilles lacks gall to make oppression bitter,"
919,I,seeing that he has suffered this bitter wrong to go unavenged.  Were he
920,I,"of like mind with me, the ruffian king would not have survived to"
921,I,"commit further outrages."""
922,I,
923,I,"A stern voice here broke in upon the seditious harangue, and Thersites"
924,I,"perceived with alarm that Odysseus was standing by him, staff in hand."
925,I,"""Peace, saucy knave!"" said the Prince of Ithaca, in threatening tones."
926,I,"""How darest thou, the very scum and refuse of the army, to hold such"
927,I,language against our exalted leader?  If I find thee uttering thy mad
928,I,"folly again, may my head be smitten from my shoulders, and may I never"
929,I,"more be called the father of Telemachus, if I do not strip thee naked"
930,I,"and drive thee forth from among the people with blows like this.""  And"
931,I,suiting the action to the word he laid the heavy staff with no gentle
932,I,hand across the deformed shoulders of Thersites.  The wretch shrank
933,I,"beneath the blow with a cry of pain, and the golden staff left its"
934,I,"print in a crimson weal on his back.  So he sat huddled together, with"
935,I,"distorted face, wiping away his tears, and spoke not another word."
936,I,
937,I,"Having thus silenced that loose tongue, Odysseus mounted a platform,"
938,I,"whence he could be seen and heard of all the host, and lifting up his"
939,I,mighty voice he began to rebuke the people for their weakness and want
940,I,"of faith.  ""Must I speak to you,"" he said, ""as to homesick women and"
941,I,"children, or as to veteran warriors bound by an oath to follow their"
942,I,"great captain for weal or for woe?  Not that I blame you overmuch, for"
943,I,indeed your service has been both long and hard.  For nine long years
944,I,"we have toiled in vain, and the cordage of our ships is rotten, and"
945,I,"their timbers are warped.  Nevertheless, endure yet a little while,"
946,I,until we have learnt whether the son of Cronos is a true prophet or no.
947,I,Ye cannot have forgotten the day when our ships were assembled at
948,I,"Aulis, or the portents vouchsafed us there at a solemn sacrifice to the"
949,I,"gods.  The altar was raised in the shadow of a goodly plane-tree, near"
950,I,"a running water; and in the tree was a nest of sparrows, a mother with"
951,I,"eight young, cheeping and cowering beneath the leaves.  Just as we were"
952,I,"kindling the altar fire, a great serpent, with blood-red back, darted"
953,I,up from the altar into the tree and pounced upon the sparrows' nest.
954,I,"The mother-bird fluttered anxiously around, uttering piteous cries to"
955,I,"see the monster devouring her young; and the serpent, when he had"
956,I,"swallowed up the nestlings, caught their mother by the wing as she"
957,I,"hovered near, and swallowed her also.  Then we beheld a wonder: for the"
958,I,"serpent, when he came down from the tree, was turned into a stone.  And"
959,I,while we stood amazed Calchas declared unto us the meaning of that
960,I,"omen: ""Why stand ye thus amazed, ye warriors of Greece?  That which ye"
961,I,"have seen is a sign from Zeus, and this is the interpretation thereof:"
962,I,"the nine birds are the nine years, during which we shall lay siege to"
963,I,"Troy, and the serpent is the tenth year, in which Troy shall fall!"
964,I,"Therefore abide steadfast, my comrades, for the nine years are passed,"
965,I,"and we are nearing the end of our labours."""
966,I,
967,I,"Odysseus ended, and a great roar of acclamation went up from a hundred"
968,I,"thousand throats, and rolled like thunder along the hollow shore.  The"
969,I,"next speaker was Nestor, who addressed Agamemnon, and bade him command"
970,I,"an immediate muster of the whole army, and lead a general attack upon"
971,I,"the Trojans.  ""Let the people,"" said he, ""be ordered according to their"
972,I,"several tribes and clans, that thou mayest distinguish the"
973,I,"faint-hearted from the loyal and valiant.  Thus shall thou learn, if"
974,I,"disaster befalleth thee, to whom it is due--whether to adverse heaven,"
975,I,"or to the cowardice and weakness of thine allies."""
976,I,
977,I,"""Thou speakest ever to the purpose,"" answered Agamemnon; ""and would"
978,I,that I had ten such counsellers as thee!  Then would Priam's royal city
979,I,"soon bow her head, sunk in the dust beneath our victorious hands.  But"
980,I,"the son of Cronos hath sown division among us, and put enmity between"
981,I,me and my bravest champion.  But to our task: let the people now get
982,I,"their morning meal, and then prepare for battle.  Let every man whet"
983,I,"his spear, and look to the fastenings of his shield; let every steed be"
984,I,"fed, and every chariot set in order, that we may fight all day till the"
985,I,going down of the sun.  There shall be no rest or respite till darkness
986,I,"puts an end to the fray.  Many a shield strap shall drip with sweat,"
987,I,"and many a hand ache with holding the spear, and the steeds shall droop"
988,I,"with weariness, ere the day be done.  And if I find any man skulking"
989,I,"among the ships, I will give his flesh to feed the dogs and vultures."""
990,I,
991,I,"Then the people arose and scattered among their tents, and soon the"
992,I,smoke of a thousand fires went eddying up into the still morning air.
993,I,"And every warrior lifted up his heart in prayer to heaven, that he"
994,I,might return safe and sound from the great perils which lay before him.
995,I,
996,I,"Agamemnon slaughtered an ox five years old, and summoned the noblest of"
997,I,"the chiefs, among whom were Nestor, Idomeneus, the two princes named"
998,I,"Ajax, Diomede, and Odysseus, to take their meal with him.  In those"
999,I,"days every meal was a sacrifice, and this was the manner in which it"
1000,I,"was performed: the company stood round the ox, holding in their hands a"
1001,I,portion of barleymeal.  Then the giver of the feast addressed a prayer
1002,I,"to Zeus, the meal was sprinkled between the horns of the victim, and"
1003,I,after that the beast was slaughtered and flayed.  Portions of the meat
1004,I,"were then cut off from the carcass, wrapped in a double layer of fat,"
1005,I,and burnt as an offering to the gods.  When all religious rites had
1006,I,"been duly paid, the choicer parts of the meat were broiled in thin"
1007,I,"slices over the fire, and eaten with wheat or barley bread.  The flesh"
1008,I,"of beeves and swine, or less commonly of sheep and goats, with bread"
1009,I,"and wine, formed almost the sole diet of the Homeric heroes."
1010,I,
1011,I,"When they had finished a copious repast, Nestor, who, despite his"
1012,I,"eighty years, was as keen and alert as the youngest soldier, sprang"
1013,I,"from his seat, and cried: ""To arms, comrades, to arms!  Agamemnon, bid"
1014,I,"the heralds summon the host to the field."""
1015,I,
1016,I,"The King gave the order required, and forthwith the heralds, who were"
1017,I,"chosen for the power and reach of their voices, went about in the camp,"
1018,I,and called the people to arms.  Then every captain called his company
1019,I,"together, and led them to the place appointed for the general array."
1020,I,"And by degrees a strange fire spread from rank to rank, kindling in"
1021,I,"every breast a fierce longing for battle.  All softer emotions, all"
1022,I,"homesick longings, were forgotten; for a mysterious influence was at"
1023,I,"work, due to the unseen presence of Athene, who was there with her"
1024,I,"wondrous, immortal shield, with its fringe of golden tassels.  None"
1025,I,"beheld her, but all felt her power, and the boldest grew bolder, and"
1026,I,the weakest were inspired with a valour not their own.
1027,I,
1028,I,"Like a fire blazing among the thickets high up on a mountainside, so"
1029,I,"blazed the sunlight on shield and helmet, as those countless thousands"
1030,I,"poured forth into the plain of Scamander, and the earth shook beneath"
1031,I,the tramp of steeds and men.  On and still on streamed the tide of
1032,I,"warriors, unnumbered as the leaves in spring, or as flies that buzz"
1033,I,"round the milkpails on a sunny day, when the goats are milked by a"
1034,I,hundred hands.
1035,I,
1036,I,"And as the shepherd numbers his sheep, for he knoweth them every one,"
1037,I,"so moved the captains with mastery, each among his own people, and"
1038,I,marshalled them in their ranks.  Conspicuous among all was seen the
1039,I,"majestic form of Agamemnon, to whom it seemed that every god had on"
1040,I,"that day bestowed some peculiar grace, to make him the observed of all"
1041,I,"observers, and give the world assurance of a king."
1042,I,
1043,I,But what tongue can count the myriads brought together by the word of
1044,I,"power on Scamander's plain, or what memory can hold the names of the"
1045,I,nations assembled there?  All the chivalry of Greece had obeyed the
1046,I,"summons of the monarch, sent forth nine years before, and they had come"
1047,I,flocking in their thousands from the broad plains of Thessaly; from the
1048,I,mountain dells of Locris and of Phocis; from the fat fields of
1049,I,"B[oe]otia; from Attica, with her thin soil and bright, pellucid air;"
1050,I,"from Salamis, the mother of heroes; from storied Argos and renowned"
1051,I,"Sparta; from the western islands, and from Creta, the cradle of gods."
1052,I,It would be a weary task to tell over all the heroic titles in that
1053,I,"muster-roll of fame, but a few must be mentioned, as being the prime in"
1054,I,valour and in worth.
1055,I,
1056,I,"From Locris came the lesser Ajax, son of Oileus.  He was small of"
1057,I,"stature, but swift of foot, and the most skilful spearsman among all"
1058,I,"the Greeks.  His greater namesake, Ajax, son of Telamon, and cousin to"
1059,I,"Achilles, came from Salamis; he was a giant in stature and in strength,"
1060,I,"and, next to Achilles, the greatest warrior in all the host."
1061,I,
1062,I,"The ancient city of Tiryns in Argos, with its massy walls, built by a"
1063,I,"mighty race in the very dawn of time, sent forth a goodly company in"
1064,I,"eighty ships; and these were commanded by Diomede, son of Tydeus, a"
1065,I,"gallant and youthful prince, whose deeds fill many a page in the tale"
1066,I,"of Troy divine.  And from the neighbouring city of Mycenæ, the royal"
1067,I,"seat of the line of Pelops, came Agamemnon himself, at whose imperial"
1068,I,"nod whole nations flew to arms.  His brother, Menelaus, the husband of"
1069,I,"Helen, on whose account the war had arisen, brought sixty ships, manned"
1070,I,"by the warriors of Sparta, of which city he was king.  He was a mild"
1071,I,"and gentle prince, and a zealous leader, though in valour and prowess"
1072,I,not of the first rank.

1098,I,"he could wield, was resting from slaughter, and his squires were"
1099,I,polishing the armour which he was not to wear that day.  He started
1100,I,"when he heard the great shout of the Greeks, as the word was given to"

1114,I,the Greeks were marching in full force against the city.  Instantly the
1115,I,"meeting broke up, and the Trojan leaders, with Hector at their head,"
1116,I,set out with the whole body of native warriors and their allies to bar
1117,I,the way of the invader.
1118,I,
1119,I,"Halting before a solitary mound, the tomb of the Amazon Myrine, within"

1121,I,"battle.  The native Trojans, who fought under Hector, son of Priam,"
1122,I,formed the flower of the army; but in numbers they were far exceeded by
1123,I,"the troops which had assembled, at the call of Priam, from the adjacent"
1124,I,"provinces and coastlands of western Asia--from Lydia, Mysia,"
1125,I,"Paphlagonia, and far-off Lycia--from Sestos and Abydos and Thrace."
1126,I,"After Hector, the most famous leaders were Æneas, son of Anchises and"
1127,I,"Aphrodite; Pandarus, unrivalled for his skill in archery; Paris, whose"
1128,I,"crime had brought all these woes on his country, and above all the two"
1129,I,"captains of the Lycians--Sarpedon, the son of Zeus, and Glaucus, the"
1130,I,most knightly figure among all the heroes of Greece and Troy.
1131,I,
1132,I,When the various members of that motley host had taken their appointed

1134,I,like flocks of cranes winging their way to the shores of the ocean

1138,I,
1139,I,Foremost among the Trojan champions was seen the gay and beautiful

1141,I,"arrows, and besides these weapons, in the use of which he excelled, he"
1142,I,was armed with two long spears and a sword.  Menelaus marked him as he
1143,I,"came on with long strides, and rejoiced in spirit, like a hungry lion"
1144,I,when he catches sight of his prey; and leaping down from his car he
1145,I,advanced with uplifted spear to take vengeance on his treacherous foe.
1146,I,"But when Paris saw him coming his guilty heart quailed within him, and"
1147,I,"he shrank back among the ranks of his comrades, like one who has"

1178,I,with a shower of stones and arrows; but Agamemnon soon perceived that
1179,I,"Hector had something to propose, and gave the signal for a general halt."
1180,I,
1181,I,"Then Hector, standing midway between the two armies, made known the"

1185,I,"said he, ""that this quarrel should be decided by the hands of us twain;"

1290,III,"natural pangs he felt, when he heard of the danger which threatened his"
1291,III,"son.  Nevertheless he set out at once, taking with him the victims"
1292,III,required for the sacrifice.  When he came to the open space between the
1293,III,two armies he found all things ready for the solemn rite.  The chiefs
1294,III,"stood waiting in a circle, and in their midst was Agamemnon, who acted"
1295,III,"as priest.  The heralds mingled two portions of pure[3] wine in a bowl,"
1296,III,and poured water over the hands of the chieftains.  Then Agamemnon drew
1297,III,"a sharp knife, which hung at his girdle by his ponderous sword, and"
1298,III,cutting off a few hairs from the foreheads of the victims gave them to
1299,III,"the heralds to distribute among the princes.  When this was done,"
1300,III,"amidst a general hush he uttered this solemn prayer: ""Father Zeus, Lord"

1302,III,"dread powers beneath, who take vengeance after death on all those who"

1329,III,"Then Menelaus lifted up his spear, and murmured a prayer to Zeus:"
1330,III,"""Grant me, O King, to take vengeance on him who brought dishonour on my"

1332,III,"good ashen spear, which clove its way through the shield of Paris, and"
1333,III,tore his tunic close to his side; but Paris swerved aside and escaped a
1334,III,"wound.  Before he could recover himself Menelaus was upon him, sword in"

1338,III,"treacherous steel!"" cried he, and, seizing Paris by the helmet, began"
1339,III,to drag him towards the ranks of the Greeks.  This time he would have
1340,III,"succeeded, and taken his enemy captive, had not the strap which held"

1347,III,carried him away from the righteous hand of the avenger.  For
1348,III,"Aphrodite, the soft goddess of love, had been hovering near to protect"
1349,III,"her favourite.  She it was who had caused the helmet strap to break,"
1350,III,"and now she saved him a second time, and bore him swiftly to his house"

1429,I,"the arrow on the string.  His companions, who had been covering him"
1430,I,"with their shields while he was making his preparations, now stepped"
1431,I,"aside, and he, having made his vow to Apollo, lifted up his bow, drew"
1432,I,"the arrow to his ear, and shot.  The bow twanged loud and clear, and"
1433,I,the arrow leapt hissing towards the Grecian ranks.
1434,I,
1435,I,"Then ill had it fared with thee, Menelaus, had not Athene been standing"
1436,I,"at thy side, to guard thee from fatal hurt.  And as a mother brushes a"
1437,I,"fly from the face of her babe, lying in sweet slumber on her lap, so"
1438,I,"Athene suffered not the arrow to reach any vital part, but guided it to"
1439,I,the place where the plates of his corslet met at his side.  Through the
1440,I,"girdle pierced the shaft, through the brazen corslet, and through the"
1441,I,taslet which covered his loins; the point just grazed the surface of
1442,I,"his flesh, and the red blood began to flow, staining his thighs, and"
1443,I,trickling down to his ankles.
1444,I,
1445,I,"When Agamemnon saw his brother wounded and bleeding, he ran to his"
1446,I,"side, and taking him by the hand began to deplore the evil issue of"
1447,I,"their treaty.  ""Must thy life pay the forfeit for the perjured men of"
1448,I,"Troy, who have trampled our covenant underfoot?  I know indeed that"
1449,I,"vengeance will overtake them in the end from the hands of Zeus, whose"
1450,I,"name they have taken in vain; yea, well I know that the day shall come"
1451,I,"when holy Ilios shall fall, involved with all her people in one common"
1452,I,"doom.  But what will that avail, if I lose thee, my brother?  My army"
1453,I,"will desert me, for they cannot fight without a cause, and thou art the"
1454,I,cause which brought them hither.  Troy's doom will be wrought by other
1455,I,"hands, and I shall go back to Argos, a beaten man, leaving thy bones to"
1456,I,"rot in a foreign grave."""
1457,I,
1458,I,"""Speak not so loud,"" said Menelaus, when Agamemnon paused at last;"
1459,I,"""thou wilt cause a panic in the army.  There is no ground for alarm;"
1460,I,"the wound is not deep.  Send for Machaon, the skilled leech, that he"
1461,I,"may draw out the arrow, and stanch the flow of blood."""
1462,I,
1463,I,"Then Agamemnon was comforted, and sent Talthybius the herald to bring"
1464,I,"the leech, who was a son of Asclepius, the most famous physician of"
1465,I,"those times.  After some delay, Machaon came to the place where"
1466,I,"Menelaus was standing, leaning on his brother's arm, and surrounded by"
1467,I,an anxious group of his friends.  With firm but gentle hand the leech
1468,I,"drew out the arrow, and, removing the prince's armour, exposed the"
1469,I,"wound to view.  Then he applied healing herbs, and bade the patient be"
1470,I,"of good cheer, for his hurt was but slight."

1473,II,II
1474,II,
1475,II,"The truce having been broken by the treacherous act of Pandarus, both"
1476,II,"sides prepared for an immediate assault.  Agamemnon, as soon as he was"
1477,II,"assured that his brother was in no danger, summoned his chariot, and,"
1478,II,"bidding the driver keep within call, went on foot up and down the ranks"
1479,II,"of the Greeks, encouraging those whom he saw pressing forward to the"
1480,II,"attack with promises of favour and reward, and upbraiding those who"
1481,II,hung back with taunts and rebukes.  His heart rejoiced when he saw the
1482,II,"towering form of Ajax, who was hurrying to battle, followed close by a"
1483,II,"stout troop of spearsmen, with shield pressing on shield, and bristling"
1484,II,"spears.  Near him was Idomeneus, the grizzled captain of the Cretans,"
1485,II,"with his comrade, Meriones, at the head of a numerous and"
1486,II,"well-appointed troop.  And after these he came to the men of Nestor,"
1487,II,who were receiving instructions from their veteran leader how to bear
1488,II,"themselves in the battle.  ""Keep your ranks,"" he was saying, ""and fight"
1489,II,"shoulder to shoulder, the horsemen in the van, and the infantry ready"
1490,II,to support them behind.  And let no one be carried away by his zeal to
1491,II,"engage singlehanded with the enemy, for union is strength, and weakness"
1492,II,"comes of division."""
1493,II,
1494,II,"These were the foremost, but there were others, and among them some of"
1495,II,"the most valiant leaders in the army, whose station was more remote,"
1496,II,and who had not yet heard of the breaking of the truce.  One of these
1497,II,"was Diomede, and when Agamemnon found him standing inactive, he rebuked"
1498,II,"him harshly, reminding him of his father's prowess, and calling him an"
1499,II,unworthy son.  The young chieftain deigned no answer to the unmerited
1500,II,"reproach, but at once put his men in motion to join the encounter."
1501,II,
1502,II,"The whole army was now advancing, rank pressing on rank, and column on"
1503,II,"column, like the waves rushing landward along a wide-watered shore."
1504,II,"The Greeks came on in silence, broken only by the short, sharp words of"
1505,II,"command; but the Trojans, whose army was made up of a motley throng of"
1506,II,"many nations, rushed to the onset with multitudinous cries, like ewes"
1507,II,"at milking-time in the folds of a wealthy sheep master, when they hear"
1508,II,"the voices of their lambs.  On the Trojan side was Ares, and on the"
1509,II,"side of the Greeks stern-eyed Athene, with whom were seen Panic and"
1510,II,"Flight, and insatiable Strife, who is small of stature at the beginning"
1511,II,"of a fray, but grows and grows as the feud proceeds, until her head"
1512,II,presses against the sky as she stalks along the earth.
1513,II,
1514,II,"Then the air was rent with a deafening crash, as the two armies met,"
1515,II,"and shield was dashed against shield, and brazen armour was dinted by"
1516,II,"spear and axe and sword.  Shouts of triumph arose, and cries of"
1517,II,"anguish, as the wild _mêlée_ swayed to and fro, and the ground ran with"
1518,II,blood.  As two torrents descending from copious springs high up in the
1519,II,"mountains, and swollen high by winter rains, mingle their waters with a"
1520,II,roar at a place where two glens meet--such was the roar which went up
1521,II,"to heaven, at the conflict of those mailed hosts."
1522,II,
1523,II,"Among the many victims of that bloody day, some are singled out for"
1524,II,"especial mention.  One of these was Simocisius, a tall and comely"
1525,II,"youth, so named because he was born on the banks of the Simocis, when"
1526,II,his mother went to visit her parents on their farm.  Ajax marked him as
1527,II,"he came on, and smote him in the breast with his spear; and down he"
1528,II,"fell, like a tall poplar, which rears its stately height in a meadow by"
1529,II,"the riverside, until it is hewn down by a wheelwright to make a felly"
1530,II,for a chariot; and there it lies seasoning on the banks of the stream.
1531,II,"So lay the young Simocisius, and Ajax stripped him of his armour."
1532,II,"While he was thus engaged, Antiphus, a son of Priam, flung a javelin at"
1533,II,"him, but, missing him, struck down Leucus, a comrade of Odysseus, who"
1534,II,had laid hold of the corpse to hale it away.  Odysseus was exceeding
1535,II,"wroth at the fall of his comrade, and stepping forward he flung his"
1536,II,"spear, and smote Democoon, a natural son of Priam, in the temple.  The"
1537,II,"Trojan champions fell back before him, and the Greeks rushed forward"
1538,II,"and gained possession of the dead.  Apollo, who sat watching the battle"
1539,II,"from the citadel of Troy, was indignant when he saw the Trojans give"
1540,II,"ground, and shouted to them in a loud voice, crying: ""Up, ye horsemen"
1541,II,"of Troy, and fly not from these Greeks, for their flesh is not of stone"
1542,II,"or of iron, to resist the thrust of your spears.  Now is your time,"
1543,II,"while Achilles is absent, chewing the cud of his ire among the ships."""
1544,II,
1545,II,"The Trojans rallied at the cry of the god, and the battle was resumed"
1546,II,"with fresh fury on both sides.  It was no child's play, no holiday"
1547,II,"tilting, which was seen that morning on the Trojan plain, but the dire"
1548,II,"and dreadful game of war, with Ares and Athene for players, and the"

1555,II,
1556,I,I
1557,I,
1558,I,"Agamemnon's taunts had sunk deep into the heart of Diomede, and he went"
1559,I,into battle with a stern resolve to vindicate his manhood in the eyes
1560,I,of all Greece.  A fierce light blazed from his helm and shield as he
1561,I,"rushed, like a living engine of destruction, into the thickest of the"
1562,I,fight.  The first to feel the weight of his arm was a young Trojan
1563,I,"named Phegeus, son of Dares, a priest of Hephæstus.  Mounted on the"
1564,I,"same car with his brother Idæus, he drove furiously at Diomede, who was"
1565,I,"fighting on foot, and aimed a blow at him with his spear; but the"
1566,I,"weapon went wide of the mark, and the next moment he rolled from his"
1567,I,"car, pierced through the breast by the spear of Diomede.  Idæus sprang"
1568,I,"to the ground and fled, leaving car and horses as a spoil to his"
1569,I,brother's slayer.
1570,I,
1571,I,"While Diomede was disposing of his booty, the Greeks pursued their"
1572,I,"advantage, and there was not a chieftain of name among them who failed"
1573,I,"to slay his man.  Then fell Scamandrius, a famous Trojan hunter, and"
1574,I,"the favourite of Artemis, pierced in the back by the spear of Menelaus,"
1575,I,"and Phericlus, whose father, Tecton, had built the fatal ships which"
1576,I,"bore Paris and his retinue to Greece, and many more, of whose names"
1577,I,there is no record.
1578,I,
1579,I,"Back to the field came Diomede, sweeping all before him like a river in"
1580,I,"flood, which breaks down dyke and dam, and covers the smiling fields"
1581,I,with ruin.  So impetuous were his movements as he darted to and fro in
1582,I,"pursuit of the flying Trojans, that it was hard to see on which side he"
1583,I,"fought; but, wherever he passed, his path was strewn with Trojan dead."
1584,I,
1585,I,"At last he received a check from Pandarus, the archer whose treacherous"
1586,I,hand had broken the truce an hour or two before.  Watching him from a
1587,I,"safe distance, Pandarus shot an arrow, which pierced clean through"
1588,I,"Diomede's right shoulder, staining his corslet with blood.  Loud was"
1589,I,"the joy of Pandarus when he saw the success of his archery: ""Turn"
1590,I,"again,"" he shouted, ""ye horsemen of Troy!  Back to the fray, every one!"
1591,I,"The bravest of the Greeks is wounded unto death."""
1592,I,
1593,I,"The boast of Pandarus was premature, for the wound was not severe,"
1594,I,though sufficient to disable the hero's arm for the moment.  Diomede
1595,I,"drew back out of the press, and with the assistance of Sthenelus, his"
1596,I,"charioteer, drew out the arrow which was galling his shoulder.  Then he"
1597,I,"stood apart and prayed to Athene, the patron goddess of his mighty"
1598,I,"father, Tydeus.  And she heard him, and came and stood before him in"
1599,I,"all her divine majesty, and said: ""Take heart, son of Tydeus, for I am"
1600,I,"ever near thee, and I have put into thy heart all the valour of thy"
1601,I,sire.  And I have taken from thine eyes the darkness which before lay
1602,I,"upon them, that thou mayest look upon the gods and know them, face to"
1603,I,"face.[1]  If thou seest any of the other gods, avoid them, and presume"
1604,I,"not to fight against the children of heaven; but if Aphrodite, Jove's"
1605,I,"froward daughter, comes into the battle, have at her, and strike, and"
1606,I,"fear nothing."""

1610,I,
1611,I,
1612,I,"Athene vanished as she spoke, but Diomede felt her influence working"
1613,I,"powerfully within him, and in an instant the flow of his blood was"
1614,I,"stanched, and he felt no more pain from his wound.  Then like a lion"
1615,I,who has been grazed by the shepherd's spear as he leaps into a lonely
1616,I,"sheepfold, and is but provoked to new rage by that slight wound, so"
1617,I,"that he falls upon the helpless flock, and gluts himself with carnage,"
1618,I,while the shepherd cowers away in terror--so Diomede returned with new
1619,I,"fury to the slaughter, and drove the Trojans in rout before him.  Like"
1620,I,"hammer on anvil, so rained his strokes among the ranks of the foe."
1621,I,With one blow he sent his spear through the breast of a tall Trojan;
1622,I,with the next his keen falchion shore oft the arm and shoulder of
1623,I,"another.  Leaving these where they lay, he went in pursuit of Abas and"
1624,I,"Polyidus, the sons of Eurydamas, a famous seer and interpreter of"
1625,I,"dreams.  Often had they listened to their father's lore, and brought"
1626,I,their dreams to him to expound unto them.  But the worst dream they
1627,I,ever had now came upon them; and when they awoke they were on the banks
1628,I,of the Styx.  Yet another Trojan father had cause to mourn that
1629,I,"day--Phænops, a man of wealth, who sent two sons, the children of his"
1630,I,"old age, to the war.  But never again did his aged eyes brighten to"
1631,I,"behold the face of his children, and all his wealth was divided among"
1632,I,strangers.
1633,I,
1634,I,When Æneas observed the havoc which was wrought by the arm of Diomede
1635,I,"he went to Pandarus, and said to him: ""Where is thy boasted skill in"
1636,I,"archery, that thou sufferest this man to hew down our ranks, and never"
1637,I,"liftest thy bow against him?  Come, shoot me an arrow at the breast of"
1638,I,"Diomede, and first utter a prayer to Zeus, that we may know if the gods"
1639,I,"are indeed against us."""
1640,I,
1641,I,"""If that be Diomede,"" answered Pandarus, ""there is something divine in"
1642,I,"this frenzy of his; methinks he is some god, who has put on the"
1643,I,"likeness of Diomede.  But now, I aimed an arrow at him, and struck him"
1644,I,fairly in the right shoulder.  I thought that he was already a
1645,I,"passenger to Hades, but, lo! he comes forth stronger and more terrible"
1646,I,"than before.  In an evil hour I took my bow from the wall, when I came"
1647,I,to fight on the side of Priam; and I hearkened not to my father's words
1648,I,"when he bade me fight like the rest with chariot and with horses,"
1649,I,whereof he had goodly store.  Twice have I drawn my bow this day
1650,I,"against the noblest of the Greeks, Menelaus, and Diomede, and struck"
1651,I,"them fair, and made their blood to flow; but it hath naught availed."
1652,I,"If ever I get safely home again, I will offer my head to be severed"
1653,I,"from my shoulders by the meanest churl, if I do not break this accursed"
1654,I,"bow of mine in pieces, and burn it with fire."""
1655,I,
1656,I,"""This is idle talk,"" answered Æneas.  ""We must meet this man face to"
1657,I,"face and hand to hand if we would stay his fury.  Come, mount my car"
1658,I,"with me, that thou mayest see of what mettle are these steeds of mine,"
1659,I,"unrivalled in flight or in pursuit.  If thou wilt, take the reins, and"
1660,I,"I will stand by thy side to wield the spear; or if thou preferrest it,"
1661,I,"I will drive and thou shalt fight."""
1662,I,
1663,I,"""Drive thou,"" replied Pandarus, mounting by the side of Æneas, ""so that"
1664,I,"if there be need of hasty flight, the steeds may not fail us, knowing"
1665,I,"their master's hand.""  ""Thou sayest well,"" said Æneas, and, lashing the"
1666,I,"horses to a gallop, drove rapidly towards the place where Diomede was"
1667,I,fighting.
1668,I,
1669,I,"""Back, Diomede!"" shouted Sthenelus, in alarm, when he saw them"
1670,I,"approaching.  ""I see two mighty men coming against us--Pandarus, son of"
1671,I,"Lycaon, and Æneas, whose mother is the goddess Aphrodite.  Mount the"
1672,I,"car, and let us retreat."""
1673,I,
1674,I,"""How darest thou name retreat to me,"" answered Diomede sternly, ""I"
1675,I,"scorn thy counsels, and will go to meet these champions even as I am,"
1676,I,"on foot; both of them shall not return alive.  And now mark my words,"
1677,I,"and do as I shall bid thee: if these twain fall beneath my spear, leave"
1678,I,"thou the horses which thou art driving, and, having mounted the car of"
1679,I,"Æneas, drive with all speed to the rear.  For these steeds are of blood"
1680,I,"divine, descended from those which Zeus gave unto Tros as a recompense"
1681,I,for the loss of Ganymede his son.  If we can capture them it will be a
1682,I,"splendid prize."""
1683,I,
1684,I,"So saying, he turned to meet the Trojan chieftains, who were now close"
1685,I,"at hand.  Pandarus held his weapon ready poised, and when he came"
1686,I,"within throwing distance he cast his lance, crying: ""Take that, bold"
1687,I,"son of Tydeus!  Perchance I shall have better luck with the spear."""
1688,I,"The weighty spear, thrown by no feeble hand, pierced through the shield"
1689,I,"of Diomede, and struck against his breastplate, but there stopped"
1690,I,"short, without inflicting a wound.  ""Thou hast no luck to-day, Sir"
1691,I,"Pandarus,"" said Diomede, smiling grimly.  ""Now see how thou likest the"
1692,I,"taste of Grecian steel,"" and as he spoke he hurled with all his force,"
1693,I,right in the face of Pandarus.  The keen point struck him just beneath
1694,I,"the eye, and passing downwards clove through his tongue at the root,"
1695,I,and came out under his chin; and the false Trojan fell with a crash on
1696,I,"the plain, and died as he fell."
1697,I,
1698,I,Æneas had now but one thought--to save his comrade's body from outrage
1699,I,at the hands of the Greeks; for it was the cruel custom of those days
1700,I,to mutilate the bodies of slaughtered enemies.  Valiantly he took his
1701,I,"stand, bestriding the fallen Pandarus, holding his shield before him,"
1702,I,"and armed with two spears.  But Diomede picked up a huge stone, and"
1703,I,"flung it at Æneas; and the jagged missile struck him on the hip, just"
1704,I,"at the socket of the thigh, bruising the sinews and lacerating the"
1705,I,"flesh.  Æneas sank down on one knee, sick and giddy with the pain of"
1706,I,that dreadful blow; and that would have been his last hour had not his
1707,I,"goddess mother perceived his evil plight, and come to her son's relief."
1708,I,"Swiftly she flew to the place where he lay, and, throwing her white"
1709,I,"arms about him, bore him from the field, covered by the folds of her"
1710,I,robe.
1711,I,
1712,I,"Sthenelus had not forgotten his friend's command, and as soon as he saw"
1713,I,the car of Æneas deserted he made fast the reins of his own steeds to
1714,I,"the chariot rim, and mounting the Trojan car drove at a gallop towards"
1715,I,the rear.  Meeting a comrade he gave the captured chariot into his
1716,I,"charge, and returned with all speed to the support of Diomede, who was"
1717,I,in hot pursuit of the tender goddess and her wounded son.  Presently he
1718,I,"caught her in the midst of the press, and, thrusting with his spear,"
1719,I,"wounded her on the hand, in the thick part of the thumb.  The ichor[2]"
1720,I,"flowed forth in a purple stream, and stained her immortal vestments,"
1721,I,wrought for her by the Graces; and with a loud shriek she let fall her

1776,III,When Diomede saw his prey snatched from him a second time he was very
1777,III,"wroth, and followed close on Apollo, who was bearing Æneas towards the"
1778,III,"city.  Three times he sprang upon the god, and three times Apollo"
1779,III,"hurled him back; and he was preparing to make a fourth assault, when"
1780,III,"Apollo rebuked him sternly, and bade him stand off.  Remembering the"
1781,III,"words of Athene, who had warned him not to meddle with any other god"
1782,III,"save Aphrodite, Diomede drew back, and Æneas was carried in safety to"
1783,III,the shelter of the citadel.
1784,III,
1785,III,"Apollo was highly incensed at the presumption of Diomede, and leaving"
1786,III,"Æneas in good hands he hastened back to the battlefield, and roused"
1787,III,"Ares to take up the cause of insulted heaven, and chastise the impious"
1788,III,man who twice that day had pointed his weapon against the person of a
1789,III,"god.  Ares readily took up the challenge, and putting on the likeness"
1790,III,of a Trojan he flung himself in the path of the panic-stricken
1791,III,"fugitives, shouting: ""Where are the sons of Priam, and why suffer they"
1792,III,"the people to be slaughtered like sheep?"""
1793,III,
1794,III,"""Hearest thou what he saith?"" cried Sarpedon, the giant leader of the"
1795,III,"Lycians, to Hector, who had been dismayed, like the rest, by the"
1796,III,"prowess of Diomede.  ""What art thou doing, thou and thy brethren, that"
1797,III,ye leave the brunt of battle to be borne by your allies?  Have we not
1798,III,"left home and country, our wives and our little ones, to pour out our"
1799,III,"blood in defence of thy city?--and wilt thou not play thy part, when"
1800,III,honour and duty call thee--when the very stones of thy streets cry
1801,III,"aloud to thee to be the first in the onset, the last to retreat?"""
1802,III,
1803,III,"Stung by Sarpedon's reproaches, Hector leapt from his car, and exerted"
1804,III,all his authority to rally the flying Trojans.  By his efforts the
1805,III,"flight was checked, and the Trojans wheeled their chariots and returned"
1806,III,to the charge.  The ranks of the Greeks grew white from the clouds of
1807,III,dust thrown up by their chariot wheels as they came on like a
1808,III,"whirlwind, with Ares in their van.  Presently, to the equal delight and"
1809,III,"amazement of the Trojans, the princely form of Æneas was seen"
1810,III,"glittering among the foremost champions; and his step was as light, and"
1811,III,"his arm as firm, as when the fight began.  They would have learnt, if"
1812,III,"they had asked, that this was the work of Apollo; but they had no time"
1813,III,"to question him, for by this time the storm of battle was raging with"
1814,III,redoubled fury.
1815,III,
1816,III,"Like clouds which lie heavy on the mountain-tops, when all the winds"
1817,III,"are sleeping, so steadfast stood the Greeks to abide the shock of that"
1818,III,"charge.  And Agamemnon strode up and down the armed files, crying as he"
1819,III,"passed: ""Stand firm, and play the man!  Before you lies the path of"

1821,III,
1822,III,"Long the contest swayed to and fro with doubtful issue, and many a"
1823,III,"Greek, and many a Trojan, named or unnamed, received the wages of the"
1824,III,"sword.  At last Diomede, whose vision had been purged by Athene,"
1825,III,"recognised Ares under his disguise; then even he began to lose heart,"
1826,III,"and cried out to the Greeks: ""We must retreat!  Ares is fighting"
1827,III,"against us.  Fall back upon the ships, keeping your faces to the foe."""

1831,III,Hitherto Hera and Athene had remained inactive spectators of the
1832,III,struggle: but when they saw that the tide of battle had turned they
1833,III,resolved to make a vigorous stand against the victorious career of
1834,III,"Ares.  With her own hand Hera harnessed the steeds to her royal car,"
1835,III,"which was the work of no mortal artist, with its brazen wheels and axle"
1836,III,of iron.  The body of the car was cunningly wrought with bands of gold
1837,III,"and silver; the pole was a solid bar of silver, and the yoke was of"
1838,III,gold.  Meanwhile Athene was arming herself for the conflict.  First she
1839,III,"put on a coat of mail, not to be pierced by any mortal weapon; on her"
1840,III,"head she placed a helmet, glittering with symbols of war and death;"
1841,III,"then she grasped her shield, the immortal ægis, of ""ethereal temper,"
1842,III,"massy, large, and round,"" on which were pictured Panic and Strife,"
1843,III,"Defence and Pursuit, and all the dread powers whose realm is the"
1844,III,"battlefield; and in the midst glared the Gorgon's head, with its awful"
1845,III,"eyes, which freeze the blood and paralyse the limbs."
1846,III,
1847,III,"Having asked and obtained permission of Zeus, they mounted the car,"
1848,III,"Hera guiding the fiery coursers of heaven, and Athene standing, spear"
1849,III,"in hand, at her side.  In another moment they drew up before the cloudy"
1850,III,"portals of Olympus, which are given in charge of the mystic Daughters"
1851,III,"of Time, to open and to shut.  Wide flew the gates, with muttered roar,"
1852,III,at the summons of the queen of heaven; and forth they leapt into the
1853,III,void and cavernous vault of air.  Far as a man can see into the dim
1854,III,"distance, when he stands on some skyey peak and gazes across the purple"
1855,III,sea--so wide is the space traversed by the heavenly steeds at a single
1856,III,stride.
1857,III,
1858,III,When they came to the place where Simoeis and Scamander mingle their
1859,III,"waters in one stream, they drew up their car, and dismounted, leaving"
1860,III,"the steeds in charge of the river-god Simoeis, whose banks put forth"
1861,III,"ambrosial herbs for them to feed upon.  Then, walking delicately, like"
1862,III,"a pair of doves,[3] but with no tender thoughts in their breasts, they"
1863,III,"went and joined the ranks of the Greeks, where they stood at bay round"
1864,III,"Diomede, like boars or lions hard pressed by the hunters.  Standing in"
1865,III,"their midst, Hera took the form and the voice of Stentor, whose shout"
1866,III,"was as the shout of fifty men.  ""Shame on you, ye Greeks!"" she"
1867,III,"thundered.  ""As long as Achilles fought among you, the Trojans never"
1868,III,ventured beyond their gates; but now they are fighting at the very
1869,III,"confines of your camp."""

1877,III,"the wound which he had received from Pandarus, which now began to"
1878,III,"stiffen and grow painful.  In this state he was found by Athene, just"
1879,III,as he was lifting up his shield strap to wipe away the blood from his
1880,III,"shoulder.  Laying her hand on the yoke of his car she said: ""The son of"
1881,III,"Tydeus is most unlike his sire, who was little of stature, but mighty"
1882,III,"of heart.  With him I needed the curb to restrain his fiery spirit,"
1883,III,which prompted him to fight against any odds.  But thy sluggish nature
1884,III,"ever wants the goad.  Say, art thou weary, or art thou afraid?"""
1885,III,
1886,III,"""It is not fear that has made me shrink,"" answered Diomede.  ""I am but"
1887,III,"obeying thy behest, when thou forbadest me to resist any god, save only"
1888,III,"Aphrodite.  And thou seest Ares is lending aid to the Greeks."""
1889,III,
1890,III,"""Fear neither Ares, nor any other god,"" replied Athene.  ""Mount thou"
1891,III,"thy car with me, and thou shalt see whether this turncoat, this fickle,"
1892,III,"furious, bloodthirsty god of war, will brook thy onset when I am by thy"
1893,III,side.
1894,III,
1895,III,"Thereupon she thrust down Sthenelus from the chariot, and taking his"
1896,III,"place beckoned to Diomede to mount with her.  Diomede obeyed, and the"
1897,III,beechen axle groaned beneath the weight of the hero and the goddess.
1898,III,"Athene plied the lash, and drove straight at Ares, who was stooping to"
1899,III,strip off the armour of a Greek champion whom he had just slain with
1900,III,"his own hand.  The goddess had put on the helmet of Hades, which made"
1901,III,"her invisible to the eyes of Ares; and he, when he saw Diomede coming"
1902,III,"against him, left off stripping the corpse, and charged with levelled"
1903,III,"spear.  But Athene caught the weapon by the shaft, and turned the point"
1904,III,"aside.  Then Diomede thrust at Ares with his spear, Athene aiding him,"
1905,III,and wounded him in the side.  And as the roar of ten thousand men in
1906,III,"the full fury of battle, so was the roar of Ares when he felt that"
1907,III,wound.
1908,III,
1909,III,"Like a heavy thundercloud, which hangs black and threatening when"
1910,III,"heaven is overcast, and a storm is brewing on a sultry day, such"
1911,III,appeared the giant form of Ares as he fled darkling across the sky to
1912,III,Olympus; and when he reached the seat of the gods he sat down near
1913,III,"Zeus, his father, and showed him the immortal blood flowing from his"
1914,III,"wound.  ""What thinkest thou,"" he said, speaking in a pitiful voice, ""of"
1915,III,these deeds of violence?  Thou art the author of this wound; for it is
1916,III,"thy weak indulgence which makes thy daughter, Athene, so violent and"
1917,III,"unruly.  Nothing but the speed of my feet saved me from worse outrage."""
1918,III,
1919,III,"But the injured Ares found scant sympathy from his father.  ""Come not"
1920,III,"to me,"" he said sternly, ""with thy whining complaints.  Blame thy"
1921,III,mother for what thou hast suffered; for to her thou owest the froward
1922,III,temper which makes thee the most hateful to me of all my children.
1923,III,"Nevertheless I will not leave thee in pain, for thou art my son, the"
1924,III,"child of my wedded love.  Were it not so, I would have found thee a"
1925,III,"place in the dungeons where the Titans groan.""  Then he laid his"
1926,III,"commands upon Pæan, the god of healing, who sprinkled powerful remedies"
1927,III,"on the wound, which gave instant relief.  Swift as is the action of the"
1928,III,"fig-juice when it falls with eager droppings[4] into milk, and turns it"
1929,III,"to curd, so quickly closed the wound under the skilful hands of Pæan."

1943,I,"Having driven Ares from the field, Hera and Athene returned to Olympus,"
1944,I,leaving the battle to be decided by human strength and valour.  Soon
1945,I,"the numbers and prowess of the Greeks began to prevail, and the Trojans"
1946,I,were gradually forced back towards their walls.  At this critical
1947,I,"moment Hector, who hitherto had played but a secondary part in the"
1948,I,"battle, was suddenly inspired with almost superhuman courage and"
1949,I,"energy, and by his example the Trojans were saved from a general rout."
1950,I,"Having allayed the panic, he left the other leaders to make head"
1951,I,"against the enemy, and went himself into the city, with the purpose of"

1954,I,
1955,I,"Both armies were growing weary of the long struggle, and during"

1961,I,"When they were met in the middle of the plain, Diomede accosted him"

1979,I,"grandsire Bellerophon, who came as an exile to Lycia, banished from his"
1980,I,"native Corinth by a woman's spite.  For, while he was dwelling as a"
1981,I,"guest in the house of Pr[oe]tus, King of Corinth, the Queen Anteia"
1982,I,"poisoned her husband's ears against him, because he had refused to be"
1983,I,"her partner in crime, and Pr[oe]tus believed her lying tale, and sought"
1984,I,opportunity to destroy Bellerophon.  So he sent him on an embassy to
1985,I,"the King of Lycia, the father of Anteia, and gave him a sealed packet"
1986,I,"to take with him.  Bellerophon set sail, and after a fair voyage he"
1987,I,"landed in Lycia, and went up to the palace of the King.  Then for nine"
1988,I,"days the King made good cheer, and invited the highest in the land to"
1989,I,meet his noble guest; and on the tenth day he asked concerning the
1990,I,business which had brought him to Lycia.  Bellerophon gave him the
1991,I,"packet, and he opened it privately, and found within it a folded"
1992,I,"tablet, whereon were written these words: _Bellerophon is a traitor,"
1993,I,and hath sought to bring dishonour on our house: he must die_.
1994,I,
1995,I,"""When he had read the message from his son-in-law the King was wroth,"

1998,I,"of a goat, and a long coiling tail like a vast serpent.  The gods"
1999,I,"helped Bellerophon to slay this monster, and the King then sent him to"
2000,I,"fight against the Solymi, a fierce and warlike tribe.  But neither they"
2001,I,"nor the Amazons, with whom also the King bade him fight, could work any"
2002,I,mischief on that valiant champion.  Yet a fourth time the King tried to
2003,I,"take his life, and sent an ambush of picked men to slay him by"
2004,I,treachery on his way back to Lycia; and Bellerophon killed them all.
2005,I,
2006,I,"""Being now assured that his guest was the favourite of heaven, the King"
2007,I,"retained him in his house as an honoured guest, and gave him his"

2187,I,
2188,I,The result of the first day's fighting had been all in favour of the
2189,I,"Greeks, but, as many had fallen on both sides, a truce was made by"
2190,I,"mutual consent for the next day, to enable both armies to bury their"
2191,I,dead.  By the advice of Nestor the Greeks dug a trench and threw up a
2192,I,"rampart for the defence of their camp, and by the zealous labour of"
2193,I,that vast multitude the work was finished on the same night.
2194,I,
2195,I,"Zeus had not forgotten his promise to Thetis, and on the morning of the"

2203,I,
2204,I,"Without waiting for question or reply, the lord of Olympus mounted his"
2205,I,"car, and swept along his airy road until he came to the mountain-range"
2206,I,"of Ida, overlooking the Trojan plain.  There he halted and took his"
2207,I,"station on Mount Gargarus, the highest peak of Ida, from which he had a"
2208,I,complete view of Troy and the Grecian camp.
2209,I,
2210,I,"Forth sallied the rival hosts, and soon the clash of arms rang through"
2211,I,"the cool morning air, as Greek grappled with Trojan in deadly conflict."
2212,I,"All through the long hours, until noon, the issue remained doubtful;"
2213,I,but when the sun stood at the zenith Zeus lifted a pair of golden
2214,I,"scales, and weighed the fates of Greeks and Trojans; and the scale"
2215,I,"which held the fate of the Greeks sank down, heavy with defeat and"
2216,I,"disaster.  Then Zeus thundered with a mighty peal from Ida, and hurled"
2217,I,his bolt among the thronging ranks of the Greeks; and they were sore
2218,I,"amazed, and pale Fear gat hold of them.  Not one among them dared to"
2219,I,"stand his ground, neither Ajax, nor Idomeneus, nor Agamemnon himself."
2220,I,"Only Nestor lagged behind, for he was hindered by the fall of one of"
2221,I,"his horses, which had been pierced through the brain by Paris with an"
2222,I,"arrow.  Nestor sprang down, and began cutting through the traces with"
2223,I,"his sword; and while he was thus engaged, Hector came thundering past"
2224,I,"in hot pursuit of the Greeks, and seeing Nestor's plight turned aside"
2225,I,"to slay him.  Diomede saw the old man's danger, and lashing his horses"
2226,I,"to a gallop drove instantly to his aid.  ""Mount, mount,"" he cried,"
2227,I,"""with me, and leave to my squires these sorry steeds of thine.  Take"
2228,I,"thou the reins, and we will see if we can check the onset of the"
2229,I,"Trojans, and arrest Hector's destroying arm."""
2230,I,
2231,I,"Nestor was not slow to obey the summons, and mounting by the side of"
2232,I,"Diomede he drove straight at Hector.  Then Diomede flung his spear, and"
2233,I,"struck down Hector's charioteer, and, pursuing his advantage, he fell"
2234,I,"fiercely on the broken columns of the Trojans, scattered in wild"
2235,I,"pursuit of the enemy.  Already the Greeks were beginning to rally, when"
2236,I,"Zeus hurled a second bolt, which crashed down before the feet of the"
2237,I,"horses of Diomede.  ""We must fly,"" said Nestor; ""heaven is against us,"""
2238,I,and wheeling the affrighted steeds he followed the main body of the
2239,I,"Greeks, who were now in full retreat towards the ships.  That was a"
2240,I,"bitter moment for the gallant Diomede, when he heard the exulting voice"
2241,I,"of Hector, calling him coward, minion, woman.  But peal after peal came"
2242,I,"from the frowning peak of Ida, now wrapped in black clouds; and that"
2243,I,proud spirit was forced to bow to a higher power.
2244,I,
2245,I,"""On, Trojans, on!"" shouted Hector, pushing on at full speed to head the"
2246,I,"pursuit.  ""Zeus favours our cause, and the Greeks are doomed.  Neither"
2247,I,"walls, nor moat, nor all their sorry devices, shall stay our fury, but"
2248,I,"we will burn their ships and cut them off to a man.""  So on they sped,"
2249,I,"driving the Greeks before them across the plain, even to the very gates"
2250,I,"of the camp.  Here the leaders turned at bay, and Agamemnon succeeded"
2251,I,by desperate efforts in restoring some order in the panic-stricken
2252,I,"host.  Foremost among the defenders of the camp were Ajax, the greater"
2253,I,"and the less, Idomeneus and his comrade, Meriones, Diomede, and Teucer"
2254,I,"the half-brother of the greater Ajax.  Teucer especially, who was a"
2255,I,"famous archer, did splendid service to the Greeks in that dreadful"
2256,I,strait.  Crouched behind the vast orb of his mighty kinsman's shield he
2257,I,"watched his opportunity, and shot down man after man as the Trojans"
2258,I,came rushing to the assault.
2259,I,
2260,I,"""Well done, brave bowman!"" cried Agamemnon, who was standing near, as"
2261,I,"the eighth victim to Teucer's skill bit the dust.  ""Now aim an arrow at"
2262,I,"yonder mad dog""; and he pointed at Hector, who was leading the attack."
2263,I,"Again the bow twanged, but this time he missed his mark, and instead of"
2264,I,"Hector struck another son of Priam, who was fighting by his brother's"
2265,I,"side.  And as droops the poppyflower in a fair garden plot, heavy with"
2266,I,"its seed-pod, and drenched with the summer rains, so drooped that"
2267,I,"comely head, oppressed by the weight of its helmet."
2268,I,
2269,I,"""Nine have I slain,"" cried Teucer, in triumph.  ""Now let me see if my"
2270,I,"tenth arrow will bring down this noble quarry""; and once more he"
2271,I,pointed a shaft at Hector's breast.  But a second time the arrow went
2272,I,"amiss, and pierced through the heart of Hector's charioteer."
2273,I,"Cebriones, Hector's brother, succeeded to this dangerous office, thus"
2274,I,twice left vacant on one day; while Hector himself sprang to the
2275,I,"ground, and picking up a stone hurled it at Teucer, who was just"
2276,I,fitting another arrow to his bowstring.  The stone struck Teucer on the
2277,I,"collar-bone, breaking the bowstring, and paralysing his arm.  Ajax"
2278,I,"sprang forward to cover his injured brother, who was carried, groaning"
2279,I,"with pain, to the shelter of the ships."
2280,I,
2281,I,"The fall of Teucer struck fresh dismay into the Greeks, who now shrank"
2282,I,"back behind their defences, Hector following them close, and cutting"
2283,I,"down the stragglers, like a hound hanging on the flanks of a wild boar."

2333,II,took his seat on his exalted throne; for he had returned from Ida when
2334,II,"his business for the day was ended.  Not a word, not a look, did he"
2335,II,receive in greeting from his wife and daughter; but he knew their

2361,III,"This was a sign of great confidence on the part of the Trojans, who"
2362,III,"hitherto had rarely ventured outside their walls, and had always"
2363,III,returned to the city at nightfall.  But now the besiegers had become

2483,I,"decided to send Ph[oe]nix, an aged noble, who was connected with"
2484,I,"Achilles by close ties of early affection, Odysseus, and the greater"
2485,I,"Ajax.  After a few words of warning and counsel from Nestor, they were"
2486,I,"despatched forthwith to the tent of Achilles, and with them went two"

2495,II,"Myrmidons, they found Achilles sitting at the door of his tent, and"
2496,II,"soothing his troubled spirit with song, and the clear music of a harp,"
2497,II,which he had taken among the spoil of Eëtion's city.  Opposite to him

2505,II,"I know why ye have come hither--sore indeed is the need.""  So saying,"
2506,II,"he led the way into the tent, and as soon as they were seated he called"

2519,II,"embers.  When all was ready, they feasted sumptuously, and drank of the"
2520,II,rich wine which Achilles poured out without stint.  The banquet being
2521,II,"ended, Ajax made a sign to Ph[oe]nix; but Odysseus took the word from"
2522,II,"him, and, rising with a full cup in his hand, pledged Achilles, and"
2523,II,"said: ""I drink to thee, son of Peleus, and thank thee for thy good"

2525,II,"Agamemnon himself.  But, alas! my noble host, we have little heart for"
2526,II,"feasting and making merry, for we stand on the very brink of ruin, and"
2527,II,thou alone canst save us.  The Trojans have pitched their camp before
2528,II,"our very gates, and it will not be long before they sweep us into the"
2529,II,"sea.  Zeus hath openly taken sides with our foes, and affrights us with"
2530,II,"thunders and with lightnings; and Hector, full of mad presumption, is"
2531,II,"breathing out threatenings and slaughter against us.  I fear--yea, I"
2532,II,"fear exceedingly--that the god will accomplish his threats, and that we"
2533,II,"are indeed doomed to perish in the land of Troy, far from our native"

2545,II,

2555,II,
2556,II,"Odysseus resumed his seat, and amidst a breathless silence Achilles"

2561,II,"is the man who hides one thing in his heart, and speaks another.  Hear,"
2562,II,"then, what I have to say.  Neither Agamemnon, nor all the Greeks"
2563,II,"together, shall turn me from my purpose.  I have fought--thou knowest"
2564,II,how I have fought--against the common foe; and what my reward hath been
2565,II,"thou knowest also.  Like a mother bird, who flies to and fro, never"
2566,II,"weary, never resting, carrying morsels to her nestlings, while she"
2567,II,"remains empty herself, so have I passed my days in war and bloodshed,"
2568,II,"and my nights in sleepless watchings, putting my life in jeopardy, for"
2569,II,"the sake of another man's wife.  Twelve cities have I sacked, sailing"
2570,II,"the sea in my ships, and eleven on land, within the realm of Troy."
2571,II,"First the toil, which was mine, and after that the spoil, which was"
2572,II,"his.  I brought it all, and laid it at his feet, and he kept the"
2573,II,"greater part by far, giving me back a little--a very little--for all my"
2574,II,"pains.  And that little he hath taken away.  Let him keep it, and joy"
2575,II,"go with it!  I loved the maid Briseis, yea, dearly I loved her!"
2576,II,Thinketh he that he alone and his brother love their wives?  She was my
2577,II,"prize, my bride: he hath torn her from mine arms, and that foul deed I"
2578,II,will never forgive.
2579,II,
2580,II,"""And as to the gifts which he offers, let him know that I came here to"
2581,II,"fight for honour, not for pelf.  He hath denied mine honour, and now he"
2582,II,would bribe me to erase that dark record with a purse of gold.  But I
2583,II,will not be bribed.  Away with his gifts!  I value them not a straw.
2584,II,Not though he offered me ten times and twenty times as much--all the
2585,II,"wealth that he hath, or ever shall have--not for all the riches of"
2586,II,"Egyptian Thebes, which sends forth ten thousand warriors, with"
2587,II,"chariots, and with horses, from its hundred gates--no, not for"
2588,II,treasures unnumbered as the sands and dust of the earth--could he buy

2607,II,
2608,II,"Deep was the disappointment of the three envoys, as they followed the"
2609,II,wild eloquence of that fierce and implacable man.  For a long time not
2610,II,"a word was spoken, for it seemed vain to argue against such passion and"
2611,II,"pride.  At last the venerable Ph[oe]nix rose feebly from his place, and"
2612,II,in a voice broken with sobs and tears began a discourse of immense
2613,II,"length, full of tender personal reminiscence and old-world legend."
2614,II,"This old man had a curious history.  Born to wealth and power, he"
2615,II,"became an exile in his youth, having been cursed by his father, whom he"
2616,II,had bitterly provoked in the course of a family feud.  In consequence
2617,II,"of the curse he remained a childless man, and, finding a new home in"
2618,II,"the land of Peleus, he lavished more than a father's tenderness on"
2619,II,"Achilles, Peleus' infant son."
2620,II,
2621,II,"These incidents from his own life, which he dwelt on with the fond"
2622,II,"garrulity of an old nurse, furnished a copious theme to Ph[oe]nix in"
2623,II,"the first part of his harangue.  ""I little thought,"" he said, ""when I"
2624,II,"set thee on my knee, a little, helpless babe, and fed thee with choice"
2625,II,"morsels of meat, and held the cup to thy lips, and thou wouldst spill"
2626,II,the wine over my gown in thy childish weakness--I little thought to see
2627,II,"thee grow up to be so pitiless and inflexible, more hard to move than"
2628,II,"the gods themselves, whom we approach with prayer and sacrifice, and"
2629,II,with bended knees.  Beware of the vengeance which waits upon a stubborn
2630,II,"and unforgiving heart.  Swift and strong is the dread goddess Ate, who"
2631,II,prompts man to give and take offence; but Penitence is an old and
2632,II,"wrinkled goddess, who goes halting behind her, to heal the mischief;"
2633,II,and if he who is wronged will not listen to her voice he himself
2634,II,"becomes the offender, and the whole guilt of the quarrel rests on his"
2635,II,"head.  Hearken thou, therefore, to her gentle pleading, and receive the"
2636,II,"bountiful gifts of Agamemnon, or the day will come when thou wilt take"
2637,II,"thy sword perforce, and fight the battles of the Greeks without reward."""
2638,II,
2639,II,Achilles listened with manifest impatience to the rambling appeals of
2640,II,"Ph[oe]nix; and when at length the old man had finished, he replied"

2646,II,"consider whether we will go or stay."""
2647,II,
2648,II,"The conference was brought to a close by a few words from Ajax, whose"
2649,II,frank and soldierly heart was hot with indignation at the vindictive

2651,II,"Laertes, let us be going.  Words are wasted on this fierce and froward"
2652,II,"man.  Surely he has a heart of stone, which no kindly thought, no"

2654,II,"his countrymen, all the loving-kindness of his friends, are as dirt"
2655,II,beneath his feet.  Many a man hath accepted a price for the blood of a
2656,II,"son or brother slain, and suffered the slayer to remain unharmed in the"
2657,II,"land; but thou, Achilles, hast scorned the most princely offers for the"
2658,II,sake of one captive maid.  O yet at last be moved!  Bring not scorn

2661,II,

2665,II,"abandoning the war.  ""Thou hast spoken well, Ajax,"" he said, ""and there"
2666,II,is much reason in what thou sayest.  But my heart boils with rage when

2792,II,for the gods to wear.  And all this ye may win without a blow.  Now
2793,II,"leave me in the custody of your comrades, or bind me fast here, that ye"
2794,II,"may know when ye return whether I have spoken the truth."""
2795,II,
2796,II,"But that night was to afford a second instance of broken faith, hardly"
2797,II,less infamous than the first.  Having tempted this poor caitiff to
2798,II,"betray his comrades by promising him his life, they now gave him the"
2799,II,"traitor's wage.  ""Thou must die, Dolon,"" said Diomede coldly, ""for all"
2800,II,"thy good news.  Thou art a foe, delivered into our hands, and thou"
2801,II,"shalt never spy upon us or fight with us again.""  Dolon clung to him"
2802,II,"with cries of anguished entreaty, pleading for his life; but Diomede,"
2803,II,"with one downward stroke of his sword, swept off his head, which"
2804,II,"rolled, with lips still moving, in the dust.  Then stripping off his"
2805,II,"armour, he hung it in a tamarisk tree, and, having marked the place,"
2806,II,went forward with Odysseus in the direction of the Thracian camp.
2807,II,
2808,II,"When they came to the quarters of Rhesus, they found him lying in the"
2809,II,"midst of his men, with his famous steeds standing near, tethered to"
2810,II,"their car.  All the troop was sleeping heavily, for they were newly"
2811,II,"arrived at Troy, and had travelled far and fast the day before.  ""There"
2812,II,"he is,"" whispered Odysseus, ""and these are his steeds, a glorious pair!"
2813,II,Now to work!  Slay me a score of these sluggards while I loose the
2814,II,"steeds."""
2815,II,
2816,II,"Thereupon Diomede drew his sword, and struck right and left like a"
2817,II,"headsman, until he had slain some dozen of the sleeping Thracians; and,"
2818,II,"as he proceeded, Odysseus dragged the slaughtered men out of the way,"
2819,II,"to make a path for the horses, which were young, and unused to such"
2820,II,"sights.  Diomede's last victim was the giant Rhesus, who was breathing"
2821,II,"heavily, and dreaming of his home; but a Grecian blade cut short his"
2822,II,"dreams, and his fleet coursers now found a new master.  While Diomede"
2823,II,"was thus busy, Odysseus untethered the steeds, and coupling them"
2824,II,"together by their harness drove them out of the camp, striking them"
2825,II,with a bow which he carried; for he had forgotten to take up the whip.
2826,II,"Diomede still lingered, meditating some final act of daring, to crown"
2827,II,"the night's adventure.  Beneath him lay the corpse of Rhesus, and his"
2828,II,"golden armour, and he was hesitating whether to take these, or slay a"
2829,II,"few more Thracians, when Odysseus gave a low whistle, warning him that"
2830,II,it was time to be going.  The next moment he heard the sound of
2831,II,"hurrying footsteps, and, perceiving that the alarm had been given, he"
2832,II,"joined Odysseus, and mounting one of the horses seized the other by the"
2833,II,"bridle, and rode at a rapid trot towards the sea.  Odysseus ran by his"
2834,II,"side, holding on by the harness, for he was no rider,[2] but a swift"
2835,II,and enduring runner.
2836,II,
2837,II,
2838,II,[2] Riding was little practised among the Homeric heroes.
2839,II,
2840,II,
2841,II,They had no sooner departed than a wild commotion arose behind them in
2842,II,"the awakened Thracian camp, but increasing their pace they soon reached"
2843,II,"the spot where they had left the unhappy Dolon, and, having paused for"
2844,II,"a moment to take up his armour, they hurried forward, and before long"
2845,II,"they were within hail of the Grecian outposts, where the whole company"
2846,II,"of the leaders was still assembled, anxiously awaiting their return."
2847,II,
2848,II,"Nestor was the first to hear the sound of the horses' feet, and"
2849,II,thinking that the Trojans were attacking he ran to raise the alarm.
2850,II,"But he was soon reassured when he heard the voice of Diomede, followed"
2851,II,a moment later by the arrival of the hardy adventurers with their
2852,II,"splendid booty.  Joyful were the greetings on both sides, and when the"
2853,II,story of that great exploit had been briefly told they all dispersed to
2854,II,"their quarters, to snatch a few hours of sleep before the toils of the"
2855,II,coming day.

2862,II,In the still hours of the dawn the Greeks were startled from their
2863,II,"slumbers by a loud and fearful cry, which came from no mortal lips, but"
2864,II,"from Eris, the dread goddess of strife, who had been sent down by Zeus"
2865,II,to give the signal for battle.  The first to obey that awful summons
2866,II,"was Agamemnon; for this was to be his great day, and his heart was"
2867,II,aflame with the lust of slaughter.  Springing from his couch he began
2868,II,"to don his armour.  First he put on his greaves, which were made of"
2869,II,"pliant white metal, with ankle pieces of silver.  Then he took up his"
2870,II,"corslet, with a glance of pride, for it was of choice and costly"
2871,II,"workmanship, cunningly fashioned of thin strips or courses of metal."
2872,II,"Ten courses were of blue steel, and ten of gold, and twenty of tin; and"
2873,II,"round about the corslet wound three serpents, wrought in divers"
2874,II,"colours, like the rainbow, with their heads meeting where the corslet"
2875,II,"narrowed at the neck.  His sword glittered with golden ornaments, and"
2876,II,"the scabbard was of silver, and the baldric of gold.  On his shield,"
2877,II,"which had ten circles of brass, were twenty bosses of white tin, and in"
2878,II,the centre a boss of blue steel; and it bore an image of the Gorgon's
2879,II,head and the dreadful faces of Rout and Panic.  Attached to it was a
2880,II,"silver strap, bearing the device of a serpent with three heads."
2881,II,
2882,II,"Glittering in this gorgeous panoply, brandishing two spears, and"
2883,II,"raising his battle cry, Agamemnon rushed to the gates of the camp, and"
2884,II,"placed himself at the head of his bravest champions, who were mustering"
2885,II,"there with the flower of the Greek army, prepared for the expected"
2886,II,attack.  They had not long to wait; hardly had they set their ranks in
2887,II,"order, when the Trojans appeared on the summit of the slope which ran"
2888,II,down to the shore.  And like a star which appears and disappears on a
2889,II,"stormy night, when the sky is covered with scudding clouds, so"
2890,II,"glittered the mailed form of Hector, as he ranged in and out among the"
2891,II,"advancing columns, marshalling his men to the fight."
2892,II,
2893,II,Then like two lines of reapers working together on opposite sides of a
2894,II,"deep field of wheat or barley, so met Greeks and Trojans on the plain"
2895,II,"before the camp, and war's dread harvest began.  None of the gods were"
2896,II,"present, save only Eris, whose savage heart was glad when she smelt the"

2941,I,Troy and the Grecian fleet and the two warring nations in the space
2942,I,between.
2943,I,
2944,I,Until the hour of noon the battle was waged with equal fortune on both
2945,I,sides.  But just at the time when a woodman in some mountain glen
2946,I,"breaks off his labour to prepare his midday meal, having wearied his"
2947,I,"hands with holding the axe, the Greeks made a vigorous charge, and"
2948,I,broke through the Trojan line.  Agamemnon fought in advance of all the
2949,I,"rest, and recognising among the enemy two sons of Priam, who had"
2950,I,"formerly been taken captive by Achilles and let go for a ransom, he"
2951,I,"slew them both, and stripped off their armour.  And as a lion slays two"
2952,I,"hapless fawns, while their dam, who is feeding near, flies sweating"
2953,I,"with terror from the onslaught of the mighty beast, so the Trojans saw"
2954,I,"their young princes slain, but were helpless to aid them, being"
2955,I,themselves hard pressed by the victorious Greeks.
2956,I,
2957,I,"Like a famished lion who has broken into a sheep-fold, and ravages the"
2958,I,"flock, so fell Agamemnon on the huddled masses of the Trojans, striking"
2959,I,about him with sword and spear.  Presently he had an opportunity of
2960,I,"gratifying his private revenge; for right before him, impeded by the"
2961,I,"press, he saw the two sons of Antimachus, a Trojan who was bribed with"
2962,I,gold by Paris to oppose the restoration of Helen.  There they stood
2963,I,"helpless, both together in one car, holding out their hands in"
2964,I,"supplication, and begging him to spare their lives.  ""There is no mercy"
2965,I,"for such as you,"" cried Agamemnon fiercely.  ""Did not your father, in"
2966,I,"the hearing of all the people, advise the murder of my brother,"
2967,I,"Menelaus, when he came on an embassy to Troy?  Die, and pay for your"
2968,I,"father's treachery.""  With that he thrust down one of them with his"
2969,I,"spear, and the other, who turned to fly, he slew with his sword,"
2970,I,"lopping off head and arms, and spurning the trunk with his foot, so"
2971,I,"that it rolled like a log along the ground.  Then, raising his battle"
2972,I,"cry, he plunged into the thick of the fight, where the main body of the"
2973,I,"Trojans were flying before the Greeks, horse and foot mingled together"
2974,I,"in headlong rout.  And as a fire sweeps through the dry brushwood,"
2975,I,"borne onward by the wind, and leaving a black waste behind, so thick"
2976,I,and fast fell the Trojans before Agamemnon; and many an empty car went
2977,I,"rattling over the field, borne hither and thither by its affrighted"
2978,I,"steeds, whose master was lying where he fell, until the vultures"
2979,I,assembled to the banquet at eventide.
2980,I,
2981,I,"Across the plain they sped, past the tomb of Ilus and the wild"
2982,I,"fig-tree, making straight for the city, and as they came to the gates"
2983,I,"they turned at bay, and waited for those who were still flying before"
2984,I,Agamemnon and the Greeks.
2985,I,
2986,I,"""Now haste thee, swift Iris!"" said Zeus to the maiden messenger of"
2987,I,"heaven, ""and bear this message to Hector.  As long as he sees Agamemnon"
2988,I,"foremost in the slaughter, let him hold back, and leave the others to"
2989,I,"stem the tide of war; but when Agamemnon receives a wound, as he shall"
2990,I,"do soon, then let Hector take the lead again, and drive the Greeks back"
2991,I,"upon their ships."""
2992,I,
2993,I,"Hector duly received the message, as he was rallying his men to defend"
2994,I,their gates; and in obedience to the command of Zeus he retired from
2995,I,"the front, and waited for the promised relief.  He had not long to"
2996,I,"wait.  Presently Agamemnon was assailed by Iphidamas, a son of Antenor,"
2997,I,"one of the chief men of Troy, who charged at him, spear in hand, and"
2998,I,thrusting with all his force struck him full on the breastplate.  But
2999,I,"the spear point was turned on the tempered metal, and Agamemnon,"
3000,I,"seizing the shaft, dragged the weapon from his hands, and smote down"
3001,I,the tall champion with a blow of his sword.  But as he was stooping to
3002,I,"strip the armour from the corpse, Coön, the brother of Iphidamas, crept"
3003,I,"up to his side, and drove his spear clean through Agamemnon's forearm."
3004,I,
3005,I,"Though grievously hurt Agamemnon turned on his assailant, and cut him"
3006,I,"down; and having thus avenged himself he still fought on, dealing havoc"
3007,I,"among the Trojans with his spear and his sword, and with heavy stones."
3008,I,"But presently his blood ceased to flow, and his arm grew stiff, as the"
3009,I,"wound began to close.  Being now in dreadful pain, he could fight no"
3010,I,"longer, and summoning his chariot he left the field, and drove at full"
3011,I,speed back to the camp.
3012,I,
3013,I,
3014,II,II
3015,II,
3016,II,"""Forward, men of Troy!"" shouted Hector, rushing to the front."
3017,II,"""Agamemnon is sorely wounded, and Zeus has promised us the victory."""
3018,II,"And as a hunter cheers on his hounds against a lion or wild boar, so"
3019,II,"Hector encouraged his Trojans, by word and by action, to assail the"
3020,II,"Greeks; and like a black squall which leaps suddenly on the Ægæan, he"
3021,II,"himself led the assault, strong in the support of Zeus, and confident"
3022,II,of victory.
3023,II,
3024,II,"Diomede marked him as he moved his way through the Grecian ranks, and"
3025,II,"stood to oppose him, poising his spear.  The weapon flew, and struck"
3026,II,"him on the helmet, but rebounded from the massive brazen ridge, and"
3027,II,"dropped on the ground.  Hector, though unwounded, was hurled back by"
3028,II,"that ponderous stroke, and sank, half-stunned, on one knee, leaning on"
3029,II,"his hand.  Following up his advantage, Diomede rushed forward to regain"
3030,II,"his spear; but meanwhile Hector had recovered from his faintness, and"
3031,II,"escaped in his chariot to the rear.  ""Again thou hast avoided death at"
3032,II,"my hands, thou dog!"" shouted Diomede after him.  ""But I will slay thee"
3033,II,"yet.""  And he stooped to take the armour from a Trojan whom he had"
3034,II,killed.
3035,II,
3036,II,"Leaning against a stone pillar, the monument of Ilus, an ancient King"
3037,II,"of Troy, stood the gay archer Paris; and when he saw Diomede kneeling"
3038,II,"by the fallen Trojan he took steady aim, and launched an arrow, which"
3039,II,"pierced through Diomede's right foot, and pinned him to the ground."
3040,II,"""Thou art hit,"" he cried, springing from his ambush with a loud laugh."
3041,II,"""Would that my shaft had cloven thy very heart!  So should I have given"
3042,II,"a breathing space to the Trojans, who cower before thee like bleating"
3043,II,"goats before a lion."""
3044,II,
3045,II,"""Out on thee, cowardly bowman!"" answered Diomede, with scorn.  ""Thou"
3046,II,"fightest thy battles from a safe distance, and shunnest the push of"
3047,II,"sword or spear.  And now thou art boasting aloud over this pinprick,"
3048,II,which harms me not at all.  There is no force in the blow from a
3049,II,"coward's arm.  But the touch of my weapon means death, and they who"
3050,II,"feel it need no second stroke.  Their last bed is the bare, cold"
3051,II,"ground, and vultures perform their obsequies."""
3052,II,
3053,II,"Notwithstanding these bold words, the wound was severe, and as soon as"
3054,II,"Odysseus, who ran to aid his friend, had drawn out the shaft, Diomede"
3055,II,was obliged to retire from the battlefield.
3056,II,
3057,II,As Odysseus was about to join the ranks of the retreating Greeks he
3058,II,"found himself hemmed in by a party of Trojan spearsmen, who surrounded"
3059,II,him with a circle of bristling points.  Then as a wild boar issues from
3060,II,"his shady lair, foaming and champing his teeth, and charges down upon"
3061,II,"the hounds and hunters who have beset the covert, so sprang Odysseus on"
3062,II,"his assailants, and in a moment four of them lay writhing at his feet."
3063,II,"The last of these, a young noble named Charops, found an avenger in"
3064,II,"Socus, his brother, who thrust so vigorously at Odysseus with his spear"
3065,II,"that the point clave through shield and corslet, and made a long ragged"
3066,II,"wound in his side.  Socus, in his turn, who fled as soon as the blow"
3067,II,"was struck, was gored in the back, between the shoulders, by the spear"
3068,II,of Odysseus.  But that sage and valiant warrior was now in deadly
3069,II,"peril; for when the Trojans saw his blood flowing, as he drew out the"
3070,II,"lance from his corslet and shield, they fell upon him like one man,"
3071,II,"with wild cries of triumph.  Slowly he gave back before them, shouting"
3072,II,"aloud to his friends to come to his rescue.  Three times he cried, and"
3073,II,"his voice reached the ears of Menelaus, who hurried to his relief,"
3074,II,"bringing with him the mighty Ajax, son of Telamon."
3075,II,
3076,II,"They came not a moment too soon, for Odysseus was hard beset by his"
3077,II,"clamorous foes, who crowded round him, like jackals round a tall"
3078,II,"antlered stag which has been wounded with an arrow, and has fled to the"
3079,II,"shelter of the woods: but while the jackals are yelping about him, up"
3080,II,"comes a great bearded lion, and scatters the jackals, and makes the"
3081,II,"stag his prey.  So when the towering form of Ajax appeared, as he"
3082,II,"advanced with his huge orbed shield, the Trojans abandoned their"
3083,II,"intended victim, and fled in dismay.  Menelaus took the wounded man by"
3084,II,"the hand, and led him to the place where his chariot was waiting,"
3085,II,"leaving Ajax occupied with a fresh column of Trojans, who came pouring"
3086,II,to the attack when they saw their friends routed.  Then mightily raged
3087,II,"the sword of Ajax, falling like a flail on the heads of his foes, and"
3088,II,man and horse went down before him.
3089,II,
3090,II,"All this time Hector had been fighting in another part of the field, at"
3091,II,"the extreme left of the line of battle, where the Greeks were led by"
3092,II,Nestor and Idomeneus.  A lucky shot from the bow of Paris disabled
3093,II,"Machaon, who, besides being a stout fighter, was the most skilful leech"
3094,II,"in the Greek army.  ""We must save him at any cost,"" said Idomeneus to"
3095,II,"Nestor.  ""A skilful physician is worth a whole troop of spearsmen."
3096,II,"Mount thou thy car, and carry him with all speed to the camp.""  Nestor"
3097,II,"did as he was advised, and Idomeneus was thus left to bear the brunt"
3098,II,alone.
3099,II,
3100,II,"Just at this moment Cebriones, Hector's charioteer, came galloping up"
3101,II,with the news that the main body of the Trojans was suffering severely
3102,II,from the attack led by Ajax.  As the departure of Nestor and Machaon
3103,II,"had left him little to do in this part of the field, Hector at once"
3104,II,"mounted his chariot, and directed his course towards the spot where"
3105,II,"Ajax was fighting.  Right between the warring lines he drove, trampling"
3106,II,"over corpses, helmets, and shields; and steeds and car were spattered"
3107,II,"with blood.  Soon he was joined by a strong troop of Trojan warriors,"
3108,II,and Ajax found himself assailed by a storm of missiles.  Then even that
3109,II,"mighty man felt a touch of fear, and throwing his shield behind him he"
3110,II,"began slowly to retire, halting at every step, and striking down some"
3111,II,too daring assailant.  Like a lion who has been driven off from a
3112,II,"herdsman's steading with javelins, and with stones, and with burning"
3113,II,"brands, yet will not leave the place, but prowls near all night,"
3114,II,"lusting after the flesh of the fat beeves--so Ajax, though hard beset,"
3115,II,"drew back reluctantly, inch by inch, before the clamour and fury of his"
3116,II,"foes.  Dogged he was, and hard to stir from his place, like some big"
3117,II,"greedy ass who has found his way into a deep field of corn, and will"
3118,II,"not budge till he has filled his belly, though assailed by a laughing"
3119,II,"crowd of children, who rain blows on his back and ribs,--even so the"
3120,II,"blows rained upon Ajax, who was encumbered by the weight of the spears"
3121,II,"which had pierced his shield.  At last, the Greeks advanced to his"
3122,II,"succour in close array, and joining their ranks he wheeled once more"
3123,II,and faced the thronging Trojans.
3124,II,
3125,II,
3126,III,III
3127,III,
3128,III,"The tide of battle had thus turned again, and the Greeks were being"
3129,III,driven steadily back upon their camp.  The roar of the conflict reached
3130,III,"the ears of Achilles, who was standing near his ship, peering out"
3131,III,eagerly over the Trojan plain; and at the same moment he saw Nestor
3132,III,"driving past in his chariot, bringing with him the wounded Machaon."
3133,III,"Then he called to Patroclus, and bade him go and inquire who the"
3134,III,"injured man was.  ""I think,"" he added, ""that it was Machaon; but the"
3135,III,"car passed me in a flash, and I saw not his face.  Methinks the hour of"
3136,III,"my revenge is near, for the Greeks are in a sore strait.""  Ah! son of"
3137,III,"Peleus, thy revenge is indeed near, but thou little dreamest how dearly"
3138,III,thou wilt pay for that bitter morsel.
3139,III,
3140,III,When Patroclus reached the tent of Nestor he found the venerable King
3141,III,"of Pylos sitting with Machaon, waiting while a handmaid prepared for"
3142,III,"them a slight refection.  The woman drew a table before them, and on it"
3143,III,"she placed a brazen dish, with onions, and honeycomb, and barley cakes."
3144,III,"Then she took a massive cup, embossed with gold, resting on a double"
3145,III,"base, and having four golden handles, each one of which was wrought in"
3146,III,"the form of two doves, which seemed to be feeding from the cup.  In"
3147,III,"this vessel she prepared a posset, pouring in a rich red wine, into"
3148,III,which she sprinkled cheese of goats' milk and white barley meal.  And
3149,III,"when the posset was ready she set it on the table, and bade them drink."
3150,III,
3151,III,"The cup was very weighty, and a strong hand was needed to lift it to"
3152,III,"the lips; but Nestor raised it easily, old as he was, and was about to"
3153,III,"take a draught, when, looking up, he saw Patroclus standing at the door"
3154,III,"of the tent.  Replacing the goblet on the table, Nestor rose to greet"
3155,III,"him, and taking him by the hand invited him to enter.  But Patroclus"
3156,III,"hesitated, wishing to return at once with the required information to"
3157,III,"his friend, whose impatient and exacting mood he knew and feared.  ""I"
3158,III,"was sent,"" he said, ""to ask the name of the wounded man, and I see that"
3159,III,"it is Machaon.  Achilles waits for an answer, and I dare not keep him"
3160,III,"waiting.""  Nevertheless, he lingered awhile, and listened to the long"
3161,III,"harangue of that ""old man eloquent,"" who soon wandered, according to"
3162,III,"his wont, into a long story of his youthful prowess, when he lived as"
3163,III,the sole survivor of twelve sons in the house of his father Neleus.
3164,III,"""But why,"" he asked, when that theme was exhausted--""why should"
3165,III,Achilles inquire about one wounded Greek?  He knows not the extent of
3166,III,"our mischances, nor how much cause we have to mourn.  Diomede, the"
3167,III,"valiant son of Tydeus, is stricken with an arrow, Agamemnon also is"
3168,III,"wounded, and likewise Odysseus.  Will Achilles now be satisfied, or is"
3169,III,"he waiting until our ships are consumed with fire, and all of us put to"
3170,III,"the sword?  Would that this arm of mine were as of yore, when I was the"
3171,III,"bulwark of my father's house, and of all my people.  But Achilles puts"
3172,III,"forth his might and his valour only for his own honour and glory, and"
3173,III,cares not though his country perish.  Canst thou do nothing with him?
3174,III,"Remember the charge which Men[oe]tius, thy father, gave thee, when we"
3175,III,"were sojourning, I and Odysseus, in the house of Peleus.  We came"
3176,III,"thither to summon thee and Achilles to the war, and ye were both fain"
3177,III,"to go.  And these were the parting words of Men[oe]tius to thee: ""My"
3178,III,"son, Achilles, is far mightier than thou, but thou art the elder, and"
3179,III,"it is for thee to guide him, and counsel him for his good.  Be wise,"
3180,III,"and be kind, and he will obey thee."""
3181,III,
3182,III,"""Ah! take those words to heart, and reason with that wilful youth.  If"
3183,III,"he is obeying some oracle from Zeus, which forbids him to go into"
3184,III,"battle, at least let him send thee to lead the Myrmidons in his stead,"
3185,III,"and let him lend thee his armour, that the Trojans may be affrighted"
3186,III,"when they see thee, thinking that Achilles has arisen.  Thus, at least,"
3187,III,"we shall get a little respite, and gain time to breathe."""
3188,III,
3189,III,"Pondering deeply on the last words of Nestor, which were to prove so"
3190,III,"fatal to himself, Patroclus hastened back on the way to his own"
3191,III,quarters.  But he was to be delayed a second time: for as he was
3192,III,"passing the tent of Odysseus he met Eurypylus, one of the bravest of"
3193,III,"the Greeks, who came limping towards him, being wounded in the thigh by"
3194,III,"an arrow.  He was a pitiful sight, begrimed with dust and sweat, and"
3195,III,bleeding copiously from his wound.  And Patroclus groaned in spirit
3196,III,"when he saw him, for he was cut to the heart to find so many of his"
3197,III,"comrades disabled.  ""Woe is me!"" he said, with a glance of pity, ""to"
3198,III,"see thee thus.  But tell me, how goes the day?"""
3199,III,
3200,III,"""We can keep the field no longer,"" answered Eurypylus.  ""The Greeks"
3201,III,must retire behind their barriers.  But thou seest how grievously I am
3202,III,"hurt; take me with thee to thy tent, and cut the arrow out of my thigh,"
3203,III,"and when thou hast washed my wound with warm water, lay thereon some of"
3204,III,"the powerful simples which Achilles received from the wise centaur,"
3205,III,"Chiron.  For of the two leeches of the army one, Machaon, is in need of"
3206,III,"a physician himself, and Podalirius, the other, is fighting in the"
3207,III,"front."""
3208,III,
3209,III,"""I am in haste,"" said Patroclus, ""howbeit, I will not leave thee in"
3210,III,"this state""; and, supporting the wounded man in his arms, he guided him"
3211,III,"slowly to his tent, and seating him on a couch of bulls' hides played"
3212,III,the part of physician with such skill and success that the blood was
3213,III,"stanched, and the sharp pain allayed."

3218,III,The Attack on the Grecian Camp
3219,III,
3220,III,"The Greeks were now driven back upon their defences, and a furious"
3221,III,struggle ensued for the possession of the walls.  The battle was no
3222,III,"longer a succession of duels, such as we have witnessed hitherto, but a"
3223,III,"desperate contest for life and death, in which high and low, nobles and"
3224,III,"commons, had to take their share.  As before, Hector took the lead, and"
3225,III,"tried to force his way across the moat, and up the steep slope on the"
3226,III,"other side, which was topped by a wall of stone, and a stiff fence of"
3227,III,"palisades.  Again and again he rushed at the yawning moat in his car,"
3228,III,"but each time his horses refused the leap, and stood neighing and"
3229,III,"trembling, with their hoofs planted at the brink."
3230,III,
3231,III,"At last, perceiving that he was wasting his strength to no purpose, he"
3232,III,"changed his method of attack, and leaving his car in charge of a squire"
3233,III,prepared to lead the assault on foot.  Some time was lost while he was
3234,III,"collecting a picked body of men to follow him, and instructing them how"
3235,III,"to proceed; and while he was taking his measures, Asius, a captain of"
3236,III,"the allies, made a bold attempt to carry the Greek position at a single"
3237,III,"blow.  Disregarding Hector's orders, he remained in his chariot, called"
3238,III,"to his troop to keep close behind him, and drove rapidly round the line"
3239,III,"of the wall, looking for a weak point where he might hope to force an"
3240,III,entrance.  He succeeded beyond his hopes; for on the extreme left of
3241,III,the camp he found a gate which was still open to admit any stragglers
3242,III,who might have been left behind in the flight of the Greeks.  With a
3243,III,"shout of triumph he drove straight at the open gateway, with all his"
3244,III,company following pell-mell.  But just as he was about to cross the
3245,III,"portals he found himself confronted by a pair of gigantic brothers, who"
3246,III,"stood like two mighty oaks deep-rooted on a mountain top, ready to"
3247,III,dispute the way.  They were well supported by the defenders who lined
3248,III,"the walls, and a hail of stones and javelins rattled down on the"
3249,III,"shields of Asius and his men, who were driven back with loss and"
3250,III,compelled to retire out of range.  The gates were then closed and
3251,III,"barred, and for this time the camp was saved."
3252,III,
3253,III,Meanwhile the Trojans under Hector's command were still hesitating on
3254,III,"the brink of the moat.  For a strange portent had occurred, which gave"
3255,III,"them pause, just as they were rushing to the assault.  On the left hand"
3256,III,"of the army they saw an eagle soaring high in the air, holding a huge"
3257,III,"serpent in his talons, which writhed and struggled to escape.  And"
3258,III,"indeed the eagle had met his match, for suddenly the serpent drew back"
3259,III,"his head, and darting forward bit his captor in the breast.  The eagle"
3260,III,"gave a scream of pain, and dropping the serpent, which fell in the"
3261,III,"midst of the Trojans, flew swiftly away."

3298,III,Meanwhile the Trojans under Hector's command were still hesitating on

3307,III,
3308,III,"All stood amazed, and doubt and fear crept into their hearts when they"
3309,III,"saw the monster writhing at their feet.  At last Polydamas, a warrior"
3310,III,"who was famed for his skill in augury, turned to Hector, and said: ""My"
3311,III,"prince, the sign is against us; and as the eagle was stricken, when he"
3312,III,"strove to carry the dappled snake to his young, so shall we also be"
3313,III,"stricken, if we persist in our assault on the Grecian stronghold.  Let"
3314,III,"us draw off our men, lest we be found fighting against the gods, and"
3315,III,"bring upon ourselves rout and disaster."""
3316,III,
3317,III,"""Polydamas,"" answered Hector, with bended brows, ""if thou hast no"
3318,III,"better counsel than this thou hadst better hold thy peace, for the gods"
3319,III,have marred thy wit.  Vain man! knowest thou not that we came hither
3320,III,"under a sure promise from Zeus?  Are we to obey his voice, or shall we"
3321,III,be cowed by the flapping of a wing?  What care I for any fowl that
3322,III,"flies east or west, while I stand under the favour of heaven's high"
3323,III,"lord?  To the patriot all omens are good, when his country summons him"
3324,III,to her defence.  A truce to thine idle prate!  Thou hast naught to
3325,III,"fear, whether we fight or fly, for thou art never seen on the perilous"
3326,III,"edge of battle.  But keep thy cold counsels for thine own coward heart,"
3327,III,"or I will find means to lock thy lips for ever."""
3328,III,
3329,III,"Thereupon he sprang forward towards the wall, and all his men followed,"
3330,III,raising a deafening shout.  And from the glens of Ida there came a
3331,III,"rushing mighty wind, which bore a blinding cloud of dust into the faces"
3332,III,"of the Greeks, and hindered them in the work of defence.  The Trojans"
3333,III,"had now crossed the moat, and were striving with all their force to"
3334,III,"break down the wall.  Some tugged at the battlements, and tried to pull"
3335,III,"them down, while others brought levers to overthrow the projecting"
3336,III,"buttresses.  On the other side the Greeks fought stubbornly, making a"
3337,III,"fence with their shields along the line of the wall, and keeping up a"
3338,III,shower of javelins and stones.
3339,III,
3340,III,"Foremost in the defence were the greater and lesser Ajax, who hurried"
3341,III,"up and down the battlements, encouraging, rebuking, and threatening."
3342,III,"""Stand fast!"" they cried.  ""This is no time for flinching.  Let every"
3343,III,"man do his part, whether he be weak or strong.  Your lives are in your"
3344,III,"own hands."""
3345,III,
3346,III,"As on a winter day, when Zeus has lulled the winds to sleep, and all"
3347,III,"the air is thick with flying snowflakes, until mountain top and jutting"
3348,III,"promontory, green field and black ploughland, level shore and rocky"
3349,III,"bay, are all hidden under the same dazzling mantle, whose fringe"
3350,III,"touches the cold, grey sea--so thick flew the missiles on either side,"
3351,III,rattling down uninterruptedly on battlement and helmet and shield.
3352,III,
3353,III,"Conspicuous among the allies of the Trojans were Glaucus and Sarpedon,"
3354,III,"the leaders of the Lycians.  They were bosom friends, of one heart and"
3355,III,one mind; and the night before they had discoursed earnestly together
3356,III,on the duties and privileges of their rank.  The words of Sarpedon on
3357,III,"this occasion are ever memorable.  ""I need not tell thee, Glaucus,"" he"
3358,III,"said, ""why we twain are honoured above all the rest with the highest"
3359,III,"seats, the costliest fare, and cups ever full, and why a fair domain of"
3360,III,corn-land and olive ground and vineyard was set apart for us on the
3361,III,"banks of Xanthus.  As we have received freely, so freely must we give,"
3362,III,sparing not even our heart's blood in the service of those to whom we
3363,III,"owe all we have.  Let us be no sluggard kings, first in the feast and"
3364,III,"last in the fray, but, as we are foremost in privilege, so let us be"
3365,III,"foremost in peril.  Man walketh as a vain shadow, and all his steps are"
3366,III,"encompassed by death; die he must, ere many days are passed--herein he"
3367,III,"hath no choice--but, unless he hath the soul of a slave, he will choose"
3368,III,"death with honour."""
3369,III,
3370,III,"Acting in the spirit of these noble words, Sarpedon, with Glaucus at"
3371,III,"his side, and all the chivalry of Lycia at his back, now made a"
3372,III,"determined attack on the part of the wall where Menestheus, the captain"
3373,III,"of the Athenians, was directing the defence.  Menestheus, feeling that"
3374,III,"he was ill provided to sustain the onset of these two famous captains,"
3375,III,raised his voice to summon Ajax to his succour; but his cry was drowned
3376,III,"by the tremendous din of the battle which was raging around him, and"
3377,III,the thundering blows which the Trojans were now raining upon the gates.
3378,III,"So he sent an urgent message by a herald, begging Ajax to come to his"
3379,III,"relief.  Ajax responded promptly to the call, and joined the men under"
3380,III,"Menestheus, bringing with him Teucer, his half-brother, who was now"
3381,III,sufficiently recovered from his wound to take part in the defence.
3382,III,
3383,III,"On came the storming party, with Sarpedon at their head, and they were"
3384,III,"already beginning to swarm up the battlements, when the arrival of"
3385,III,"Teucer and Ajax gave them a check.  Lifting up a ponderous stone, which"
3386,III,"he found lying loose by the wall, Ajax dashed out the brains of a stout"
3387,III,"Lycian, whose knee was already on the rampart, and down he toppled,"
3388,III,"plunging headforemost, like a diver, into the moat; and at the same"
3389,III,moment a lucky shot from Teucer's bow struck Glaucus in the arm.
3390,III,"Incensed to see his comrade wounded, Sarpedon redoubled his efforts,"
3391,III,and grasping one of the battlements with both hands he wrenched it from
3392,III,"its place, and sent it crashing to the ground.  But, being fiercely"
3393,III,"attacked by Ajax and Teucer together, he was compelled to draw back a"
3394,III,"little, and wait for support.  ""On, Lycians!"" he shouted.  ""Why loiter"
3395,III,"ye behind?  I cannot win the wall alone."""
3396,III,
3397,III,"The Lycians rallied to the voice of their prince, and the battle was"
3398,III,renewed with fresh fury on both sides.  Up the steep bank they swarmed
3399,III,"again, and strove with all their might to drive back the defenders from"
3400,III,"their battlements.  But the Greeks would not yield an inch, and"
3401,III,besiegers and besieged held their ground stubbornly in that grim
3402,III,"controversy, like two farmers who stand, with measuring-lines in their"
3403,III,"hands, disputing hotly about a few inches of ground, on the boundaries"
3404,III,"of their fields--or like an honest labouring woman, who holds the scale"
3405,III,"in even balance, weighing the wool which she has spun to win a scanty"
3406,III,wage wherewith to buy her children bread.[1]  So in even balance hung
3407,III,"the fray, and many were the wounds given and received in back or in"
3408,III,"breast, until the battlements ran with blood."
3409,III,
3410,III,
3411,III,[1] The yarn is weighed to show that none of the raw wool has been
3412,III,stolen.
3413,III,
3414,III,
3415,III,"But the chief honour of the day was reserved for Hector, who was the"
3416,III,first to set foot within the fortress of the Greeks.  While the battle
3417,III,"was still raging on the wall, he made his way to the main entrance of"
3418,III,"the camp, which was defended by stout oaken gates, fast closed with"
3419,III,"massy bolt and bar.  In front of the gates lay a huge stone, such as"
3420,III,two men could hardly lift in these less heroic days.  Lifting the
3421,III,"mighty boulder, he carried it, easily as a shepherd carries a fleece,"
3422,III,"close up to the gates.  Then, planting his feet firmly, he heaved that"
3423,III,"ponderous mass above his head, and flung.  Like a thunderbolt flew the"
3424,III,"enormous missile, dashing through panel and bolt and bar.  The gates,"
3425,III,"torn from their hinges, fell inward, and over the ruins sprang Hector,"
3426,III,"with brow black as night, and death in his glance.  Terribly gleamed"
3427,III,"his brazen armour as he leapt upon the foe, with a lance in each hand."
3428,III,None save the gods could have dared to face him in that hour of triumph
3429,III,"and victory.  The Trojans poured in behind him, or leapt down from the"
3430,III,"wall, now deserted by the panic-stricken Greeks, who fled with one"
3431,III,accord to the shelter of their ships.

3472,I,"comrades!"" said he, addressing himself to Ajax, who, with his namesake,"
3473,I,"was still heading the defence; ""we shall beat them yet, if only we can"
3474,I,"quench the fury of that madman, Hector, who bears himself like a son of"
3475,I,"Zeus.  Have at them, and thrust them back from the ships!"""
3476,I,
3477,I,"His words were common, but they were uttered by a god, and breathed a"
3478,I,"mysterious influence, which was aided by a light touch from the staff"
3479,I,which he bore.  Instantly a strange lightness and vigour entered into
3480,I,"their limbs, and when the pretended Calchas vanished as abruptly as he"
3481,I,"came, they knew that the words which they had heard were spoken by no"
3482,I,mortal lips.
3483,I,
3484,I,"Without pausing for a moment, Poseidon continued the work which he had"
3485,I,"begun.  From rank to rank, from leader to leader, he flew, inspiring,"
3486,I,"encouraging, entreating; and wherever he passed a new fire was kindled"
3487,I,"in every breast, so that they who but a moment before had given up all"
3488,I,"for lost now thought with shame of their faintheartedness, and rallied"
3489,I,"to the call of their leaders, resolved to conquer or die."
3490,I,
3491,I,Where Ajax and his namesake fought were mustered the choicest troops in
3492,I,"the Greek army.  Shoulder to shoulder, and knee to knee, they stood,"
3493,I,"making a firm fence with shield overlapping shield, and bristling with"
3494,I,"a forest of spears.  ""Stand fast!"" shouted Ajax, as Hector came on with"
3495,I,"headlong rush, like some huge rock, which hangs threatening on a steep"
3496,I,"mountain-side, until it is undermined by a winter torrent, and thunders"
3497,I,down the slope until it has spent its force and lies motionless on the
3498,I,plain.  So Hector hurled himself with fury against the solid phalanx of
3499,I,"the Greeks, but spent his fury in vain on that hedge of iron, and could"
3500,I,"not break through it, for all his rage."
3501,I,
3502,I,
3503,II,II
3504,II,
3505,II,"Idomeneus, the leader of the Cretans, had been absent some time from"
3506,II,"the battle, attending to a wounded comrade, and when he left him he"
3507,II,"went to his tent, to replace part of his armour, which had been damaged"
3508,II,"in the fight.  On reaching his quarters he was met by Meriones, his"
3509,II,"second in command, who had gone to fetch a fresh spear, having broken"
3510,II,"his own on a Trojan shield.  ""What doest thou here, Meriones?"" he"
3511,II,"asked.  ""Art thou wounded, or bringest thou some message to me?"""
3512,II,
3513,II,"""I came to fetch a spear,"" answered Meriones; ""my own was broken in the"
3514,II,"fight.""  ""Spears there are in plenty in my tent,"" said Idomeneus, ""and"
3515,II,"helmets, and shields, and burnished corslets--the spoils of many a"
3516,II,"vanquished Trojan.""  ""And in mine too there is no lack of such,"""
3517,II,"replied Meriones.  ""But thy tent was nearer.  Thou knowest best whether"
3518,II,"I do my devoir on the field of honour or not."""
3519,II,
3520,II,"""I have seen thee prove thy manly worth,"" said Idomeneus.  ""Thou needst"
3521,II,not remind me.  I have noted thy bearing in the long cold hours of the
3522,II,"night, when thou wast one of a picked company lying in ambush, and"
3523,II,"waiting for the dawn.  This is the sternest, sharpest test of valour"
3524,II,"and endurance.  Mark then the coward, how he flushes, and then pales,"
3525,II,"shifting uneasily from one foot to another, as he cowers in his place,"
3526,II,"with chattering teeth and wildly beating heart, and mark the hero,"
3527,II,"crouched, like a good hound, motionless and silent, ready to spring at"
3528,II,his enemy's throat.  None ever passed through that sharp ordeal with
3529,II,"more honour than thou.  And in open battle thy face is ever to the foe,"
3530,II,and thy scars are all in front.  But enough of this: here stand we
3531,II,"bragging of our prowess, while our comrades are encompassed by the"
3532,II,"flames of war.  Let us away, and show our manhood by deeds, not words."""
3533,II,
3534,II,Like murderous Ares when he arms him for battle in the savage land of
3535,II,"Thrace, and by his side goes Terror, his son, whose fierce eyes appal"
3536,II,"the stoutest heart, so rushed Idomeneus back to the field, with"
3537,II,"Meriones, his trusty friend.  ""Let us make for the left of the fighting"
3538,II,"line,"" cried Idomeneus.  ""On the right the Trojans are weaker, and in"
3539,II,"the centre fights Telamonian Ajax, a pillar of strength, the equal of"
3540,II,"Achilles in all save speed of foot.  On the left the need is sorest,"
3541,II,"with most room for a leader of note."""
3542,II,
3543,II,"As on a wild and gusty day, when two clouds of dust are whirled"
3544,II,"together by conflicting winds, so met the Greek and Trojan columns,"
3545,II,"with clash of shield and glitter of spear, when Idomeneus and his"
3546,II,comrade returned to the field.  Not in vain had Idomeneus boasted of
3547,II,his deeds of war.  Many a Trojan went down that day before his spear;
3548,II,"and the first of them was Othryoneus, who was lately come to Troy, and"
3549,II,"was a suitor for the hand of Cassandra, the fairest of Priam's"
3550,II,daughters.  Great was the price which he had promised to pay for his
3551,II,"bride.  ""Give me thy daughter,"" he said, ""and I will drive these Greeks"
3552,II,"out of the land.""  But the lance of Idomeneus cut short his wooing, and"
3553,II,"down he fell with a sounding crash.  ""Is it thou, gallant bridegroom?"""
3554,II,"shouted Idomeneus, as his helmet fell off, exposing his face.  ""How"
3555,II,"wilt thou keep thy bargain with Priam now?  That wager is lost, but"
3556,II,"come with me, and we will find thee a fair partner yet.  Thou shalt"
3557,II,"have the fairest of Agamemnon's daughters, if thou wilt aid us to sack"
3558,II,"the stately city of Troy.  How likest thou the terms?"""
3559,II,
3560,II,"Thus insulting his fallen foe, Idomeneus began to drag him away by the"
3561,II,"foot, intending to spoil him of his armour.  While thus employed, he"
3562,II,"was confronted by Asius, who came on foot against him, his squire"
3563,II,"following close with the chariot, so that he felt the hot breath of the"
3564,II,"horses on his shoulders.  But Idomeneus was too quick for him, and"
3565,II,"pierced him, as he stood with weapon poised, in the throat, driving the"
3566,II,"point clean through his neck.  Like an oak, or poplar, or tall pine,"
3567,II,"hewn down on a mountainside to make a ship's timber, so fell that proud"
3568,II,"champion, and lay in his blood at his horse's feet, moaning and"
3569,II,clutching at the dust.  The charioteer was dumfoundered by his master's
3570,II,"fall, and dropped the reins in his terror; and while he stood thus,"
3571,II,"with staring eyes and gaping mouth, Antilochus thrust him through with"
3572,II,"his spear, and leaping into the car drove off with his prize."
3573,II,
3574,II,"Idomeneus was now fiercely assailed by a formidable antagonist, in the"
3575,II,"person of Deiphobus, a brother of Hector, and one of the bravest of the"
3576,II,Trojans.  Idomeneus crouched low as he saw him coming with brandished
3577,II,"spear; and the weapon passed over him, just grazing the rim of his"
3578,II,"shield, but found a victim in another Greek, who was advancing to his"
3579,II,"support, and received the point in his breast.  Down he went, and"
3580,II,"Deiphobus cried exultingly: ""Not unavenged falls Asius, but I have"
3581,II,"given him a companion on his journey to the shades."""
3582,II,
3583,II,"Thus saved from his peril, the stout old Cretan glared about him,"
3584,II,looking for another mark for his spear; and he found one in the young
3585,II,"Alcathous, who was married to a daughter of Anchises, and was thus"
3586,II,"closely related to Æneas.  The youthful prince, being new to the work"
3587,II,"of war, was bewildered by the roar and tumult of the struggle which was"
3588,II,"raging around him, and stood, overpowered by sudden panic, within close"
3589,II,"range of the Cretan captain's lance.  ""Sleepest thou, pretty lad!"""
3590,II,"shouted the grim veteran, ""I will wake thee from thy slumber.""  And he"
3591,II,"clove him through the breast with his spear, which stilled the last"
3592,II,beatings of his heart.
3593,II,
3594,II,"""Three Trojans for one Greek!"" shouted Idomeneus.  ""Art thou content,"
3595,II,"Deiphobus?  Come hither, and I will add a fourth.  It will be glory"
3596,II,"enough for thee to die by the hand of Idomeneus, whose grandsire was"
3597,II,"Minos, the very son of Zeus."""
3598,II,
3599,II,"Deiphobus deemed it prudent to decline the challenge, and he went in"
3600,II,"search of Æneas, to inform him of his kinsman's fall.  Æneas was"
3601,II,"loitering in the rear, for he had a grudge against Priam, which chilled"
3602,II,his ardour for the battle.  But when he heard that Alcathous was slain
3603,II,"his heart burned to avenge him, and he hurried to the front, where he"
3604,II,"was joined by Paris and a strong band of Trojans.  Idomeneus, on his"
3605,II,"part, was reinforced by the arrival of Meriones, Antilochus, and"
3606,II,"Ascalaphus, a son of Ares, with their followers; and so the fight raged"
3607,II,"on, and many a stout warrior went down to swell the muster-roll of"
3608,II,death.
3609,II,
3610,II,"There fought Helenus, the prophetic son of Priam, armed with bow and"
3611,II,"arrows, and wielding a mighty falchion, tempered in a Thracian forge."
3612,II,With one blow of that trenchant blade he shattered the helmet of a
3613,II,"Greek warrior, a friend of Menelaus, and laid him at his feet, stunned"
3614,II,"and bleeding.  Menelaus sprang to his friend's relief, and flung his"
3615,II,"spear at Helenus; and at the same moment Helenus shot an arrow, which"
3616,II,"struck the prince on the breastplate, but rebounded as beans or pulse"
3617,II,"rebound from the winnower's shovel, while the spear of Menelaus pierced"
3618,II,"him through the left hand, pinning it to the bow.  Helenus retired,"
3619,II,"trailing the spear after him, until a comrade drew it out, and bound up"
3620,II,"the wounded hand with a woollen sling, which he took from his squire."
3621,II,
3622,II,"Menelaus was now attacked by another Trojan chieftain, who, after"
3623,II,"making an abortive thrust with his spear, took in his hand an axe,"
3624,II,"which hung inside his shield, and, swinging the weapon over his head by"
3625,II,"its long shaft of olive-wood, leapt upon him with a fierce cry.  But"
3626,II,before the blow could descend he received a fearful wound in the
3627,II,"forehead, from the sword of the Spartan king, and fell backwards in the"
3628,II,"dust.  ""So may all the Trojans perish!"" cried Menelaus, setting his"
3629,II,"foot on the breast of his prostrate foe.  ""Ye have robbed me of my"
3630,II,"wife; ye have plundered my treasure, after receiving generous welcome"
3631,II,"under my roof.  And now ye come hither to burn our fleet, and butcher"
3632,II,"us in our camp.  Great sire of heaven, men praise thy righteousness,"
3633,II,and call thee wise above all gods and men: how then canst thou lend thy
3634,II,"countenance to these bloodthirsty robbers, whose pastime is murder,"
3635,II,"whose joy is to betray?"""
3636,II,
3637,II,"[Illustration: Menelaus.  Vatican, Rome]"
3638,II,
3639,II,"Carried away by his eloquence, Menelaus failed to observe that he was"
3640,II,"threatened by a new assailant.  This was Harpalion, son of the King of"
3641,II,"Paphlagonia, who charged at him, lance in hand.  Menelaus was just in"
3642,II,"time to receive the blow on his shield, and before Harpalion could"
3643,II,"recover his weapon he was transfixed by the spear of Meriones, and lay"
3644,II,"writhing like a worm on the ground, until he was borne, groaning, from"
3645,II,"the field by his attendants, followed by his weeping father."
3646,II,
3647,II,"Paris was wroth at the fall of the Paphlagonian prince, who was his"
3648,II,"friend and guest, and he drew his bow at a venture, and slew Euchenor,"
3649,II,"the son of a famous seer, who dwelt in Corinth.  Often his father had"
3650,II,prophesied to him that he was destined to die either by a wasting
3651,II,"disease, or on the battlefield at Troy.  He chose a warrior's death,"
3652,II,"and found it on that day, by the hand of Paris."
3653,II,
3654,II,
3655,III,III
3656,III,
3657,III,"In the other part of the camp, near the main gate, where Hector had"
3658,III,"first effected an entrance, the Greeks were still fighting with"
3659,III,"indomitable spirit under Telamonian Ajax, and his namesake, the son of"
3660,III,"Oileus.  These two held together, and battled side by side, like two"
3661,III,"stout oxen yoked to the same plough, and toiling from dawn till sunset,"
3662,III,while the sweat streams without ceasing from the roots of their horns:
3663,III,"so stood they side by side, and bore the brunt, all through that long"
3664,III,and bitter fray.  And behind them were arrayed the bowmen and slingers
3665,III,"of Locris, whose captain was the lesser Ajax, and kept up such a shower"
3666,III,"of arrows and leaden bullets that the Trojans at length began to waver,"
3667,III,and broke their ranks.
3668,III,
3669,III,"When Polydamas, the wisest head among the Trojans, saw that the great"
3670,III,"assault, which had begun so boldly, was beginning to flag, he called"
3671,III,"Hector aside, and said to him: ""Hector, thou art strong of hand, but"
3672,III,"weak of head.  Seest thou not that we are wasting our valour, by"
3673,III,"fighting thus in scattered parties, with no settled plan of attack?"
3674,III,"Now, hearken to me, and do as I shall say, if thou wouldst not have us"
3675,III,driven back in shameful rout upon the town.  Gather all our parties
3676,III,"into one strong phalanx, and charge with them all at once on one point"
3677,III,"in the Grecian line.  Thus, and thus only, may we hope to prevail,"
3678,III,"outnumbered as we are by two to one."""
3679,III,
3680,III,"Hector saw that the advice was good, and, leaving Polydamas to hold the"
3681,III,"Greeks in check, he went in search of Asius, Deiphobus, and the rest,"
3682,III,who were fighting on the left.  Sore were the gaps which now appeared
3683,III,"in that gallant company, and many a hero, whom he called by name, was"
3684,III,"lying cold in death.  Gathering such as remained, he formed them into"
3685,III,"one body with those whom he had left in the charge of Deiphobus, and"
3686,III,"with the powerful column thus formed made repeated charges, which were"
3687,III,sustained with undaunted firmness by Ajax and his men.

3696,I,"While the battle swayed to and fro, and the Greeks were enabled by"
3697,I,"Poseidon's aid to hold their own against the Trojans, Zeus was sitting"
3698,I,"on a lonely peak of Ida, wrapped in a high celestial reverie.  Hera saw"
3699,I,"the uxorious king from her place of outlook on Olympus, and, noting his"
3700,I,"abstracted mood, she resolved to play him a trick.  So she went to her"
3701,I,"chamber, which her son Hephæstus had made for her, and opened the door"
3702,I,"with a private key, which she always kept by her, so that none might"
3703,I,"invade her apartment in her absence.  Having locked herself in, she"
3704,I,"began to make her toilet with peculiar care.  First, she washed her"
3705,I,"person with ambrosia, and anointed herself with a fragrant oil, so rich"
3706,I,"and rare that, when she lifted the lid of the casket in which it was"
3707,I,"stored, a divine perfume filled earth and heaven with sweetness.  Then"
3708,I,"she dressed her lustrous hair, and put on a wondrous robe, which"
3709,I,"Athene's own hands had wrought for her, clasping it to her bosom with"
3710,I,"golden brooches.  A rich girdle confined her robe at the waist, and in"
3711,I,her ears she hung earrings of costly pearl; and when she had put on her
3712,I,"sandals, and thrown a glittering veil over her head, she went forth"
3713,I,"smiling in triumphant beauty, like a bride adorned for her husband."
3714,I,
3715,I,"Having thus prepared the whole battery of her charms, she went in"
3716,I,"search of Aphrodite, and when she had found her she drew her apart from"
3717,I,"the other gods, and said: ""Wilt thou grant me a boon, dear child, or"
3718,I,"wilt thou deny me in anger, because I favour thine enemies, the"
3719,I,"Greeks?""  ""Name thy request, great queen of heaven,"" answered"
3720,I,"Aphrodite, ""and I will grant it, if I can."""
3721,I,
3722,I,"Concealing her real purpose, the cunning Hera replied: ""I am bound on a"
3723,I,"journey to the ends of the earth, to visit the ancient deity Oceanus,"
3724,I,"and Tethys, his wife, who have long been parted by a bitter quarrel."
3725,I,If I can bring them together in love and kindness I shall do a good
3726,I,"deed, and repay part of the great debt of gratitude which I owe them."
3727,I,"Therefore, lend me, I pray thee, the mighty talisman which thou hast,"
3728,I,"whereof neither man nor god can resist the powerful spell."""
3729,I,
3730,I,"""It becomes me not,"" answered Aphrodite, ""to deny thee in this, for"
3731,I,"thou art the consort of high Jove.""  And therewith she took from her"
3732,I,"bosom an amulet, in which there was a mysterious virtue, able to soften"
3733,I,"the hardest heart, and turn it to thoughts of love and tenderness."
3734,I,"There dwelt persuasion and sweet endearment, the eloquence of silence"
3735,I,"and the witchery of sighs.  ""Take it,"" she said, ""and hide it in the"
3736,I,"folds of thy robe.  Armed with this, thou wilt accomplish all thy"
3737,I,"desire."""
3738,I,
3739,I,"Hera smiled her thanks, and taking the amulet sped away on her errand,"
3740,I,"which carried her, not, as she had pretended, to the distant dwelling"
3741,I,"of Oceanus, but to Lemnos, the Ægæan isle, the home of sleep.  Arrived"
3742,I,"there, she sought out the drowsy god, and found him nodding in his"
3743,I,"shadowy cave.  ""Monarch of men and gods,"" she began, ""Immortal Sleep,"
3744,I,"thou hast done me good service in the past, and I think thou wilt not"
3745,I,fail me now.  I would have thee lock fast the eyes of Zeus in slumber
3746,I,"deep and long.  Ask me not why, but do it, and I will give thee a"
3747,I,"golden throne, wrought, with a footstool, by Hephæstus, my son, whereon"
3748,I,"thou mayest sit in state like the Olympian king himself."""
3749,I,
3750,I,"""Ask me aught else,"" answered Sleep, lifting his heavy eyes with a look"
3751,I,"of fear, ""only ask me not to lay Zeus in slumber against his will."
3752,I,"Hast thou forgotten what wild work he made when, at thy entreaty, I"
3753,I,"shed my power upon him, and lulled his wits in a deep trance, that thou"
3754,I,"mightest wreak thy malice on his favourite, Heracles?  Then didst thou"
3755,I,"raise a storm, which drove Heracles far out of his course, when he was"
3756,I,"on his voyage from Troy.  But when thy lord awoke, and saw what thou"
3757,I,"hadst done, he fell to buffeting all the gods in Olympus, who had"
3758,I,hidden me from his sight.  And soon they must have delivered me to his
3759,I,"vengeance, and I should have been undone, but an ancient and venerable"
3760,I,"deity, even Night herself, came to my aid, and besought him to pardon"
3761,I,"me; and so he did, for he would not offend the august goddess, primeval"
3762,I,"Night."""
3763,I,
3764,I,"""Go to,"" said Hera.  ""This is a far smaller thing than that of which"

3766,I,"Greeks.  Come, do as I bid thee, and thou shalt have Pasiphaë, one of"
3767,I,"the Graces, for thy wife, and so fulfil the dearest of thy desires."""
3768,I,
3769,I,"Then Sleep was glad, and answering said: ""Swear to me, by the"

3771,I,"on the sea, that all the nether gods may be our witnesses--swear that"

3773,I,
3774,I,"Hera took the oath required, calling by name all the Titans that dwell"

3776,I,paused not till they reached the wooded hills of Ida.  Upwards then
3777,I,"they soared, over the forest-clad slopes, and there was the sound of a"
3778,I,going in the tree tops as they passed.  And when they came to the peak
3779,I,"where Zeus was sitting, Sleep disguised himself in the form of a swift,"
3780,I,and hid himself in the branches of a tall fir-tree.  But Hera went and
3781,I,stood in the presence of her lord.
3782,I,
3783,I,As soon as the god saw her he was struck with wonder at her surpassing
3784,I,"beauty, and his heart overflowed with tenderness, as in the old days"
3785,I,when first he made her his bride.  And the little swift shot down from
3786,I,"the tree, and come flitting round the monarch's head.  ""Dear lady of my"
3787,I,"love,"" said he, ""sit down by me awhile, and let us hold sweet converse"
3788,I,"together.""  So down she sat by his side, and took his hand, and"
3789,I,beguiled him with her false blandishments.  Like two simple lovers they
3790,I,"seemed, caught in sly Cupid's silver net--he the sovereign of earth and"
3791,I,"heaven, and she, his imperious queen.  And swiftly the subtle influence"
3792,I,"of Sleep came over him, and down he sank overpowered, couched on a soft"
3793,I,"bed of crocus and hyacinth and violet, which the earth put forth to"
3794,I,"bear up his sacred person; and on him rested a canopy of golden cloud,"
3795,I,that he might slumber unobserved.

3800,II,"Safe now from the observation of Zeus, Hera descended swiftly to bear"

3803,II,"remained watching by the side of Zeus, ready to give warning when he"

3805,II,
3806,II,"Poseidon was not slow to seize the occasion thus offered.  Suddenly, as"

3808,II,"there appeared in their van a gigantic warrior, clad from head to foot"
3809,II,"in mail of proof, and wielding a sword which flashed and burned with an"
3810,II,"awful light.  ""On, Greeks, on!"" he shouted; and his voice was as the"
3811,II,"sound of many waters.  ""Down with them, even unto the ground, that"
3812,II,"Hector may know that there is more than one Achilles among us.""  And"
3813,II,"the two armies met, with a crash which was echoed by all the caverns of"
3814,II,"Ida, and recoiled again, each solid phalanx reeling from that"
3815,II,tremendous shock.
3816,II,
3817,II,"Into the space thus left sprang Hector, and hurled his spear at Ajax,"
3818,II,who was stepping forth to meet him.  The weapon struck him on the
3819,II,"breast, just at the point where the shield strap, heavily studded with"
3820,II,"metal, was crossed by the baldric of his sword; and this double"
3821,II,"barrier, backed by the corslet, proved an effectual defence.  Hector"
3822,II,"fell back, vexed at his ill-fortune, and, as he was retiring, Ajax"
3823,II,"picked up one of the stones which were lying around, to serve as props"
3824,II,"for the ships, and flinging it struck him on the back of the neck, just"
3825,II,above the rim of his shield.  It was no maiden's hand which had aimed
3826,II,"that blow, and Hector was sent spinning like a top.  And as an oak"
3827,II,"reels and staggers when struck by the bolt of Zeus, and topples"
3828,II,"headlong to earth, a blackened and shattered trunk, so fell the mighty"
3829,II,"Hector, crushed under the weight of his shield, which was pressed down"
3830,II,upon him by the ponderous stone.
3831,II,
3832,II,"When they saw him fall, the Greeks rushed forward, hoping to make him"
3833,II,their prisoner.  But the bravest of the Trojans and their
3834,II,"allies--Sarpedon, Æneas, Glaucus, and Polydamas--interposed their"
3835,II,"shields, giving time for the others to lift him up and carry him to the"
3836,II,place where his car and horses were waiting.  Carefully they placed his
3837,II,"senseless body on the chariot, and drove him towards the city, until"
3838,II,"they came to the ford of Scamander.  There they halted, and, laying him"
3839,II,"on the bank, dashed water in his face.  Presently he looked up, and"
3840,II,leaning forward on his hands began to vomit blood.  Then darkness came
3841,II,"over his eyes, and he fell back again in a swoon."
3842,II,
3843,II,"Now that Hector was down, the Trojans had no course left to them but to"
3844,II,"retreat.  They still fought valiantly, and the Greeks had to pay dear"
3845,II,for their success.  But slowly and surely they were being driven back
3846,II,from the camp.

3851,II,The Last Battle by the Ships
3852,II,
3853,II,Hera was watching the action with such eagerness that she had forgotten
3854,II,"her charge, and was startled by the angry voice of Zeus, who had"
3855,II,"awakened suddenly, and was looking down upon her with lowering brows."
3856,II,"""This is thy work,"" he said sternly, pointing to the Trojan plain,"
3857,II,"where Hector lay senseless, and his comrades were beginning to fly."
3858,II,"""Wilt thou never be schooled to obedience, or what harder lesson"
3859,II,lackest thou yet?  Dost thou remember the time when I hung thee in
3860,II,"chains in the cold vault of ether, with two anvils at thy feet, and all"
3861,II,the gods together were powerless to relieve thee?  This was thy reward
3862,II,"for thy evil devices against my son, Heracles; but that shall be mirth"
3863,II,and laughter compared with the rod which thou shall feel if thou cease
3864,II,"not from thy mutiny against my sovereign will."""
3865,II,
3866,II,"Then Hera was sore afraid, and she answered submissively: ""I swear by"
3867,II,"earth and heaven, and by the down-falling waters of Styx, the greatest"
3868,II,"and most awful thing by which a god may swear--yea, by thy sacred head"
3869,II,"I swear it, and by the holy bond which unites us--it was not by my"
3870,II,"devices that Poseidon first began to aid the Greeks, but he was led"
3871,II,"thereto by the thoughts of his own heart.  And, by my advice, he will"
3872,II,"give way to thee."""
3873,II,
3874,II,"Somewhat appeased by her humility, Zeus replied: ""If that be so, and"
3875,II,"thou art willing to heal the mischief thou hast done, go and send"
3876,II,"hither Iris and Apollo, that they may receive my commands.  And"
3877,II,understand me once for all--I will not cease from my rage and my fury
3878,II,"against the Greeks, nor suffer any of the gods to aid them, until the"
3879,II,"vengeance of Pelides is accomplished, and the oath fulfilled which I"
3880,II,"sware unto his mother, Thetis, when she touched my knees and besought"
3881,II,"me to honour her son."""
3882,II,
3883,II,Swift as is the glance of the mind when some great traveller revolves
3884,II,"all his wanderings in thought, and murmurs to himself: ""Would that I"
3885,II,"were in this place or that!"" naming some distant scene which he hath"
3886,II,"visited, so swiftly flew Hera with her lord's message.  When she"
3887,II,"reached Olympus she found all the gods seated together, drinking their"
3888,II,"nectar from golden cups.  Smiling with her lips, but bending her dark"
3889,II,"brows in a gloomy frown, she said, as she eyed that festal gathering:"
3890,II,"""Ye are making good cheer, I see!  And ye will be cheered the more when"
3891,II,"I tell you what Zeus intends.  Ay, drink deep!"" she continued, turning"
3892,II,"to Ares, who was just draining a full cup, ""thou hast need of comfort,"
3893,II,"for thy son is slain.""  And she named a Greek, Ascalaphus, son of Ares,"
3894,II,who had been slain by Deiphobus in the battle.
3895,II,
3896,II,"When he heard that, the god of war groaned with grief and anger, and"
3897,II,"crying: ""I will avenge him!"" rushed to seize his arms.  But Athene"
3898,II,"hastened after him, and finding him already equipped for battle she"
3899,II,"snatched the spear from his hand, and took the helmet from his head,"
3900,II,"saying: ""Madman, wilt thou undo us all?  Go back to thy place, lest the"
3901,II,"wrath of Zeus descend upon the whole company of the gods, and on thee"
3902,II,"the first.  Better men have fallen than this son of thine, and we must"
3903,II,"look to our own safety, and leave mortals to their fate."""
3904,II,
3905,II,"While Athene was occupied in restraining the frenzy of Ares, Hera"
3906,II,despatched Iris and Apollo to receive the commands of Zeus.  So they
3907,II,"went forthwith to Ida, and found Zeus sitting in the place where he had"
3908,II,"slept, with the golden cloud still hanging above his head.  Zeus was"
3909,II,well content that his wilful consort had been so prompt in his
3910,II,"business, and he commanded Iris to go down to the fleet, and warn"
3911,II,"Poseidon to leave the battlefield.  ""And thus and thus shalt thou say"
3912,II,"unto him,"" added Zeus, instructing her in the very words which she was"
3913,II,to use.
3914,II,
3915,II,"Iris descended to earth, walking delicately along her rainbow bridge,"
3916,II,"and, having found Poseidon among the warring Greeks, she said to him:"
3917,II,"""Thus saith Zeus, our sovereign lord and king: 'Let Poseidon leave the"
3918,II,"battlefield, and depart to Olympus, or to his own watery realm.  And if"
3919,II,"he will not obey me I will come myself, and fight against him, face to"
3920,II,"face.  Let him avoid my hands, for he knoweth that I am far mightier"
3921,II,"than he, and higher in station and in dignity.'"""
3922,II,
3923,II,"""What!"" answered Poseidon, swelling with injured pride.  ""Am I my"
3924,II,"brother's slave, that he sends me this haughty summons?  I am no"
3925,II,"subject of his, but his peer, holding a third part in our divided"
3926,II,empire.  For three sons were born unto Cronos--Zeus and Hades and
3927,II,"myself.  And when Cronos ceased to reign we cast lots between us, and"
3928,II,"Zeus obtained the throne of heaven, I of the sea, and Hades of the"
3929,II,"underworld; but the earth, and wide Olympus, were left common to us"
3930,II,"all.  Therefore I bid him keep to his own domain, and not meddle with"
3931,II,"me, for I will not live under his laws, nor bow to his rod, which he"
3932,II,"may keep for his sons and daughters."""
3933,II,
3934,II,"""Is this, then, the answer which I must carry back to Zeus?"" asked Iris"
3935,II,"gravely.  ""Oh, reflect a little!  Enter not into an unnatural feud with"
3936,II,"thine elder brother."""
3937,II,
3938,II,"""'Tis wisely said,"" replied Poseidon.  ""Thou art a discreet messenger,"
3939,II,"and knowest how to season thy words with courtesy.  'Twere ill, as thou"
3940,II,"sayest, to stir up the demon of domestic strife among us.  Therefore I"
3941,II,"will depart, and leave him to work his will.  But, since he has used"
3942,II,"threats, let him hear this from me: if he seeks to avert the doom of"
3943,II,"Troy, he will find a cold welcome when he joins the circle of the gods"
3944,II,"in Olympus."""
3945,II,
3946,II,It was not without relief that Zeus heard of Poseidon's submission; for
3947,II,"he had feared that he would be obliged to engage in a fearful struggle,"
3948,II,which would have confounded earth and heaven.  This danger being
3949,II,"removed, he sent Apollo, armed with his own shield--the awful ægis,"
3950,II,clothed with attributes of terror--commanding him to heal Hector of his
3951,II,"hurt, and bring him back to battle.  Like a falcon stooping on his"
3952,II,"quarry, Apollo shot down from Ida's peak, and alighted at the ford of"
3953,II,"Scamander, where Hector was still lying.  By this time the stricken man"
3954,II,"had recovered from his swoon, and was gazing in bewilderment around him."
3955,II,
3956,II,"One touch from that potent hand, one word from those immortal lips,"
3957,II,sufficed to banish all the effects of the fearful blow which had left
3958,II,"Hector as weak as a child.  Bounding to his feet, he cried: ""Lead on,"
3959,II,"mighty god!  I fear no perils with thee at my side,"" and like a gallant"
3960,II,"war horse, that smelleth the battle afar off, he ran at full speed to"
3961,II,"rejoin the Trojans, who were now flying tumultuously from the camp."
3962,II,And as when a troop of hunters with their hounds have started a royal
3963,II,"stag, and chased him with wild halloo to the thick covert of a tangled"
3964,II,"wood; then suddenly they shrink back with cries of dismay, for they see"
3965,II,a lion standing in the path: so panic fell upon the Greeks in the midst
3966,II,"of their triumph, when they saw Hector returning to battle, full of"
3967,II,"vigour and courage, though they had already counted him among the dead."
3968,II,
3969,II,"On poured the Trojans, Hector and Apollo leading the van, and the"
3970,II,"Greeks gave ground before them, scared by the dread ægis, which Apollo"
3971,II,"shook in their faces, crying his terrible cry.  At first they yielded"
3972,II,"slowly, keeping their ranks, and attempting some defence; but soon the"
3973,II,"retreat became a rout, and the moat was filled with a struggling"
3974,II,"multitude, seeking the shelter of the wall and the ships.  ""Kill,"
3975,II,"kill!"" cried Hector fiercely.  ""Pause not to strip the dead, but slay"
3976,II,"the men, and burn their ships.  Let me but see anyone skulking behind"
3977,II,"for plunder and he dies by my hand."""
3978,II,
3979,II,"With that he lashed his horses, and drove straight across the moat, the"
3980,II,"Trojans following him in dense column.  In front strode Apollo,"
3981,II,"trampling down the sides of the moat as he went, and making a path"
3982,II,broad as the farthest cast of a spear.  Then he hurled himself on the
3983,II,"wall, and overthrew it, as easily as a child destroys with his feet a"
3984,II,castle of sand which he has raised in sport on the margin of the sea.
3985,II,
3986,II,"Like a towering billow, which topples down upon a ship, crushing her"
3987,II,"bulwarks and flooding her with brine, so rushed the Trojans in a"
3988,II,"torrent over the wall, and fell upon the hindmost row of ships; and the"
3989,II,"Greeks on their side mounted the decks, and thrust at their assailants"
3990,II,"with long boarding-pikes, which lay ready to hand."
3991,II,
3992,II,Foremost among the defenders was seen the giant form of Telamonian
3993,II,"Ajax; and by his side fought Teucer, whose bow had already done such"
3994,II,good service to the Greeks.  But just as Teucer was aiming an arrow at
3995,II,"Hector his bowstring snapped, and the arrow dropped harmless to the"
3996,II,"ground.  ""Fate is against us to-day,"" he cried; ""it was a new string,"
3997,II,"the stoutest and the best I had, which I fitted to my bow this very"
3998,II,"morning."""
3999,II,
4000,II,"""Go quickly,"" answered Ajax.  ""And arm thyself with shield and spear;"
4001,II,"there is no room here for thine archery to-day.""  And Teucer went and"
4002,II,"armed himself, and returned with all speed to his mighty brother's side."
4003,II,
4004,II,"Hector was overjoyed when he saw Teucer's mishap, which he hailed as"
4005,II,"the direct act of Zeus himself.  ""On, Trojans!"" he shouted; ""on, ye men"
4006,II,of Lycia!  Zeus is fighting on our side.  Now is the great day of
4007,II,"vengeance, after all the weary years when we were penned within our"
4008,II,"walls like sheep."""
4009,II,
4010,II,"""Why flinch ye?"" cried Ajax, in his turn, to the Greeks.  ""Know ye not"
4011,II,"that we must conquer or die to-day?  Or will we reach home on foot, if"
4012,II,"ye suffer your ships to be burned?  Come, join the wild dance to which"
4013,II,"Hector summons us.  Fight, and we will drive out this rabble yet; but"
4014,II,"if ye falter we shall surely perish."""
4015,II,
4016,II,"Again the Greeks rallied to the well-known voice of Ajax, and drew up"
4017,II,"in close order before the ships, barring Hector's way.  But the finger"
4018,II,"of Apollo had touched him, filling his breast with a divine frenzy."
4019,II,"Foaming and glaring with rage, he flung himself on the solid phalanx,"
4020,II,"and cut down a tall champion of Mycenæ, making a gap in the line."
4021,II,"Before the Greeks could close their ranks the Trojans were among them,"
4022,II,hewing them down as a woodman hews a path through the forest.  Forward
4023,II,"and still forward they pressed, driving the Greeks before them, and"
4024,II,compelling them to retire from the first line of ships.
4025,II,
4026,II,Then nothing but the tremendous valour of Ajax could have saved the
4027,II,"Greek army from total rout and ruin.  Active as a panther, in spite of"
4028,II,"his huge bulk, he sprang from deck to deck, wielding an enormous"
4029,II,"boarding-pike and striking down the Trojans, as they advanced with"
4030,II,"lighted torches to set fire to the ships.  Like a practised rider, who"
4031,II,"yokes together four horses, and drives them at a gallop along a level"
4032,II,"highroad, leaping from one steed to another as he goes--so Ajax shifted"
4033,II,"his ground from one ship to another, dashing down Trojan after Trojan,"
4034,II,and shouting to the Greeks to come to his support.
4035,II,
4036,II,"It was a grim and desperate struggle.  There was no shooting of arrows,"
4037,II,"no casting of javelins now, but foot to foot, and hand to hand, they"
4038,II,"fought, with axe, and sword, and spear.  At last Hector forced his way"
4039,II,"to a beautiful galley, which had brought Protesilaus[1] to Troy, and"
4040,II,"laying his hand on the high, fanlike ornament of the stern he shouted:"
4041,II,"""Bring a torch, that I may be the first to kindle the fire which shall"
4042,II,"burn these accursed ships, which came here for our destruction, but"
4043,II,"shall now serve as a pyre for their crews."""

4057,I,"and nearer, and he heard the voice of Hector calling for a torch, he"
4058,I,"would delay no longer, but sprang up and ran in headlong haste to the"
4059,I,quarters of the Myrmidons.  There he found Achilles still sitting
4060,I,"before his tent, and listening to the mingled cries of triumph and"
4061,I,dismay which came from the distant scene of conflict.  When Patroclus
4062,I,"saw him, he came and stood by his side, and lifted up his voice, and"

4064,I,
4065,I,"""Why weepest thou, Patroclus,"" asked Achilles, ""like a little maid, who"

4067,I,"her face with tearful eyes, begging to be carried?  What means this"

4069,I,"these tears for the Greeks, now perishing by their own transgression?"""
4070,I,
4071,I,"""Ah! son of Peleus,"" answered Patroclus, with a pitiful sigh, ""take not"
4072,I,"my words amiss, but I am sore afflicted for the sake of my countrymen."
4073,I,"Their best and noblest are grievously wounded, and the leeches are busy"
4074,I,about them; and those that remain can no longer make head against the
4075,I,"foe.  Can nothing move thee?  What avails all thy splendid manhood, if"
4076,I,"thou wilt sit idle here, until thine arm is palsied with age?  Oh! yet"
4077,I,"at last relent, if thou art indeed the son of gentle Thetis, and not"
4078,I,"some savage changeling, born of the rocks, and nourished by the sea!"
4079,I,"If thou wilt not go to the field thyself, at least let me put on thine"
4080,I,"armour, and lead the Myrmidons to aid our friends in their dreadful"
4081,I,"strait."""
4082,I,
4083,I,"For some time Achilles answered nothing, and it was evident that a sore"
4084,I,"struggle was passing in his breast.  At last he looked up, and said"
4085,I,"with an effort: ""Thou hast prevailed, son of Men[oe]tius, though I"
4086,I,vowed that I would never cease from mine anger until the fire had
4087,I,reached my own ships.  When I think of the foul outrage----  But
4088,I,"enough!  Down, down, rebellious pride!""  He paused, frowning, and"
4089,I,"grinding his teeth; for the fierce fit had come on him again.  Then,"
4090,I,"mastering himself, he continued: ""Thou shalt have my armour, and lead"
4091,I,"the Myrmidons to battle.  But take heed to what I shall say, and let"
4092,I,"not thine ardour carry thee too far, but when thou hast driven the"
4093,I,"enemy out of the camp lead thy men back, and be not tempted to fight in"
4094,I,"the open field, lest thou rob me of mine honour, and leave naught for"
4095,I,"me to do.  Remember this, and have a care for thyself, for they have a"
4096,I,"mighty ally on their side, even Apollo."""
4097,I,
4098,I,"While they were thus conversing, Ajax was still keeping up an unequal"
4099,I,struggle against an overpowering force.  The Trojans surrounded the
4100,I,"ship on which he was fighting, and plied him with a shower of missiles,"
4101,I,"which rattled on his helmet, and threatened every moment to bring him"
4102,I,"down.  His left shoulder ached with holding his shield, which was"
4103,I,thrust back upon him by a dozen spears at once.  Yet still he fought
4104,I,"on, with his breath coming in heavy gasps, and the sweat pouring from"
4105,I,"every limb.  Then Hector aimed a blow with his sword, and cut off the"
4106,I,"head of the pike which Ajax was wielding.  Thus left without a weapon,"
4107,I,"Ajax was compelled at last to retreat, and the Trojans rushed forward,"
4108,I,and set fire to the ship.
4109,I,
4110,I,"Achilles saw the smoke rising, and cried: ""Arm thee, Patroclus.  Make"
4111,I,"haste!  I will go and call up the Myrmidons.""  Patroclus hurried to the"
4112,I,"tent, and put on the armour of Achilles--the greaves and starry"
4113,I,"corslet, the helmet and vast orbed shield--and girded on his great"
4114,I,"comrade's sword.  Only the spear of Achilles he took not, for no arm in"
4115,I,"all the host, save only the arm of Achilles, could wield that ponderous"
4116,I,"beam of ash, toughened by many a storm on the windy slopes of Pelion,"
4117,I,where it grew.
4118,I,
4119,I,"Meanwhile Automedon, Achilles' charioteer, was yoking to the car the"
4120,I,"two immortal steeds--Xanthus and Balius--offspring of the West Wind,"
4121,I,and nourished on the meadows by the shores of Oceanus.  And with them
4122,I,"went as a trace horse the mortal courser, Pedasus, which Achilles had"

4124,I,
4125,I,"When the Myrmidons heard their leader's voice calling them to arms,"
4126,I,"they rushed forth from their tents, like thirsty wolves which have"

4128,I,"bloodstained chaps and lolling tongues, to slake their thirst in a deep"
4129,I,"mountain pool.  With like eagerness arose the hardy veterans, whose"
4130,I,warlike spirit had been fed high by their long repose; and proud was
4131,I,"the glance of Achilles, as he glanced down the armed files, marshalled"
4132,I,"under five famous captains, five times five hundred men.  When all were"
4133,I,"standing silent at their posts he addressed them briefly, and said:"
4134,I,"""Now is the time to make good the threats which ye uttered against the"
4135,I,"Trojans, during all the long time of my wrath.  Remember how ye"

4139,I,"loving comrades, keeping them here in inglorious ease.'  See that your"
4140,I,"deeds are as valiant as your words, and let the Trojans feel the weight"
4141,I,"of your arm this day."""
4142,I,
4143,I,"Firm and close as blocks of stone, fitted together by a master-builder"
4144,I,"to be the wall of some great house, so stood the warriors in that"
4145,I,"invincible column, shield leaning on shield, and man on man; and in the"
4146,I,"van were seen the tall figures of Patroclus and Automedon, two leaders"
4147,I,"with one heart.  Then Achilles went to his tent, and brought forth a"
4148,I,"golden goblet, a gift from his mother, and sacred to the service of"
4149,I,"Zeus.  Having purified it with sulphur, and washed it with fresh water,"
4150,I,"he cleansed his own hands, and filling the bowl with wine returned to"
4151,I,the open space before the tent.  Then lifting up his eyes to heaven he
4152,I,"poured the drink-offering, and prayed thus to the king and lord of"
4153,I,"Olympus: ""O thou, whose ancient dwelling is in wintry Dodona, where thy"
4154,I,"chosen priests serve thee day and night with fasting and prayer, as"
4155,I,"thou hast lent thine ear to my former petition, and grievously"
4156,I,"afflicted the Greeks for my sake, so grant me once more my heart's"
4157,I,"desire.  Let thine eyes rest with favour on my noble comrade, and give"
4158,I,him honour in the battle.  And when he hath driven the Trojans from the
4159,I,"camp bring him back safe, with his armour, and all this company, to our"
4160,I,"tents."""
4161,I,
4162,I,"So prayed he in his ignorance, having yet to learn that Zeus is a"
4163,I,"jealous god, dispensing his gifts with unequal hand, two evil for one"
4164,I,good.
4165,I,
4166,I,
4167,II,II
4168,II,
4169,II,"Like a swarm of wasps which have their nest by the roadside, and being"
4170,II,ever provoked by wanton children wreak their vengeance on some harmless
4171,II,"wayfarer; so flew the Myrmidons to join the fray, and soon the Trojans"
4172,II,"felt their sting.  ""For Achilles and for honour!"" shouted Patroclus, as"
4173,II,"he hurled his spear, and struck down Pyræchmes, the savage leader of a"
4174,II,wild mountain tribe from northern Greece.  The rude clansmen fled when
4175,II,"they saw their leader fall, and soon the panic spread to the whole"
4176,II,"Trojan army, and they too fled, leaving the burning ship, the flames of"
4177,II,which were soon quenched by a score of eager hands.  Like a cloud which
4178,II,"lies heavy on a mountain top, and is then suddenly rent and dispersed,"
4179,II,"revealing all the long range of countless hills, peak beyond peak, far"
4180,II,"away to the distant sea, with green glades between, and above the"
4181,II,"boundless chasm of sky, up to the dazzling zenith: so was dispersed"
4182,II,"that cloud of Trojans which had hung about the ships, and the Greeks"
4183,II,saw the fair face of Hope again.
4184,II,
4185,II,But the end of that long and bloody day was still far off.  Outside the
4186,II,"barriers the Trojans rallied again, and a fearful slaughter ensued."
4187,II,"There the sword of Patroclus bit deep, making dire havoc among the"
4188,II,"ranks of the Lycians, until Sarpedon, their leader, incensed by the"
4189,II,"slaughter of his men, sprang from his car, and threw himself in the"
4190,II,"way, to arrest that destroying hand."
4191,II,
4192,II,"Like two vultures, which tear each other with beak and claw, fighting"
4193,II,"with loud screams on a lofty crag, so leapt the two champions, the"
4194,II,"Lycian and the Greek, upon each other, uttering loud their battle-cry."
4195,II,
4196,II,When Zeus saw his son Sarpedon about to engage in deadly combat with
4197,II,"Patroclus he was filled with pity, for he knew that the Lycian"
4198,II,"chieftain was going to his doom.  ""How sayest thou, Hera,"" he began,"
4199,II,"""shall I save him, and waft him away in a cloud to his fair domain in"
4200,II,"Lycia, or shall I leave him to his fate?"""
4201,II,
4202,II,"""That must not be,"" answered Hera.  ""His thread is spun, and his life"
4203,II,is forfeit; shouldst thou annul that decree it will be an evil example
4204,II,"to the other gods, who will forthwith all seek to avert the stroke of"
4205,II,"fate from their sons, of whom many are fighting in the fields of Troy."
4206,II,"If thou wouldst do him honour, send Death and gentle Sleep to bear him"
4207,II,"softly, after he has fallen, from the battlefield, and bring him to his"
4208,II,"kinsfolk in Lycia, that they may pay him the rites which are due to the"
4209,II,"mighty dead."""
4210,II,
4211,II,"""Thou hast persuaded me,"" answered Zeus, bowing his immortal head in"
4212,II,"sorrow.  And he caused a rain of blood to fall upon the earth, in sad"
4213,II,tribute to the heroic spirit which was about to pass away.
4214,II,
4215,II,"While this debate was proceeding, the struggle had already begun.  In"
4216,II,the first cast of their spears both warriors missed their aim.
4217,II,"Patroclus slew the comrade of Sarpedon, while Sarpedon's lance struck"
4218,II,"Pedasus, the mortal steed, in the shoulder, and he fell dead.  His"
4219,II,"immortal companions plunged wildly, striving to break away from the"
4220,II,yoke when they saw their comrade slain.  But Automedon cut the traces
4221,II,"by which the slaughtered steed was attached to the car; and, being rid"
4222,II,"of their sad burden, Xanthus and Balius were once more obedient to the"
4223,II,rein.
4224,II,
4225,II,"Again the heroes flung their spears, and the weapon of Sarpedon flew"
4226,II,over his antagonist's left shoulder.  But the spear of Patroclus sank
4227,II,"deep into Sarpedon's breast, and he fell, writhing in his death agony,"
4228,II,"and sending forth loud groans, like a bull when he feels the lion's"
4229,II,"claws tearing his flanks.  So raged Sarpedon in the pangs of death, and"
4230,II,rolling his eyes he sought the familiar face of his beloved Glaucus.
4231,II,"""Friend of my heart!"" he cried, ""valiant Glaucus, companion of all my"
4232,II,"toils, now must thou prove thy manly worth.  Rally round thee the"
4233,II,"stoutest of the Lycians, and let not thy foot go back, or thy hand"
4234,II,"cease from slaying, until thou hast saved my body from the Greeks.  To"
4235,II,"thee I shall be a reproach, and a hanging of the head, even unto thy"
4236,II,"life's end, if thou leave me, a rifled and dishonoured corpse, in the"
4237,II,"hands of the foe."""
4238,II,
4239,II,"Even as he spoke, death stopped his breath and darkened his eyes.  And"
4240,II,"Patroclus set his foot on the corpse, and drew forth his spear, while"
4241,II,the Myrmidons took possession of the empty car with its affrighted
4242,II,steeds.
4243,II,
4244,II,Glaucus was in dire distress when he heard his dying comrade's voice.
4245,II,But he was disabled by the wound which he had received in scaling the
4246,II,"wall.  Nursing his injured arm, he prayed aloud to Apollo: ""Hear me, O"
4247,II,"King, whether thou art now in Lycia or in Troy; for thine ear is ever"
4248,II,"open to the cry of need, however far away.  My hand is maimed, and my"
4249,II,"arm is burning with sharp pains, so that I cannot wield my spear,"
4250,II,"though Sarpedon is fallen, and his father hath forsaken him.  So"
4251,II,"forsake thou not me, but heal my wound, and give me back my strength,"
4252,II,"that I may save his body from outrage."""
4253,II,
4254,II,"Apollo heard, and granted his prayer, and straightway the flow of his"
4255,II,"blood was stopped, and he felt in his body that he was healed of his"
4256,II,"hurt.  Then Glaucus was glad, and he made all haste to do his comrade's"
4257,II,bidding.  First he called to the men of Lycia to do battle for their
4258,II,"slaughtered captain, and then he went to rouse the Trojan leaders to do"
4259,II,their duty by their great ally.  Finding Hector engaged in another part
4260,II,"of the field, he reproached him for his neglect.  ""Hast thou"
4261,II,"forgotten,"" he asked indignantly, ""what thou owest to us, who have come"
4262,II,on a far journey to shed our blood for thee and thy country?  Cold lies
4263,II,"Sarpedon, chief pillar of thine allies; come, friends, and help us to"
4264,II,"save his corpse, or ye will be shamed for ever."""
4265,II,
4266,II,"This was bitter news for the Trojans, who reverenced Sarpedon as the"
4267,II,chief corner-stone of their defence; and they rushed with one accord to
4268,II,avenge his death.  Patroclus on his side summoned the bravest of the
4269,II,"Greeks to his aid, and the whole fury of the struggle was now centred"
4270,II,in the place where the dead Sarpedon lay.
4271,II,
4272,II,"The first who fell in this new battle was a friend of Patroclus, who"
4273,II,"years ago had found a new home in the house of Peleus, having been"
4274,II,banished from his own country for the murder of his cousin.  He was now
4275,II,"struck down by a stone from the hand of Hector; and Patroclus, in his"
4276,II,"anger at his comrade's death, made so furious an assault that the"
4277,II,Trojans gave way before him about the length of a spear's cast.  Then
4278,II,"Glaucus advanced again, and slew Bathycles, a man of high note among"
4279,II,"the Myrmidons; and Meriones on the other side killed Laogonus, the"
4280,II,"priest of Idæan Zeus.  Æneas, ever famed for his piety, hurled his"
4281,II,"spear at Meriones, hoping to avenge the fall of that sacred head; but"
4282,II,"Meriones stooped low, and the spear flew over his head, and sunk deep"
4283,II,"in the ground, with quivering shaft, just behind him.  ""The Cretan can"
4284,II,"dance, I see!"" shouted Æneas; ""he comes from a land of dancers.""  ""Thou"
4285,II,"shall dance to my piping, before thou hast done,"" answered Meriones"
4286,II,"derisively.  ""Thinkest thou that we owe thee a life for every cast of"
4287,II,"thy spear?""  ""Peace!"" said Patroclus, rebuking him.  ""We must fight"
4288,II,"with our swords, not with our tongues, if we would do aught worthy"
4289,II,"here."""
4290,II,
4291,II,"Thick and fast rained the blows, on shield and helmet and mailed"
4292,II,"breast, as the two armies closed again, and the sound was as of an army"
4293,II,of woodmen plying their axes together in a deep mountain glade.  In the
4294,II,"midst lay the lifeless Sarpedon, covered from head to foot with"
4295,II,"javelins, and blood, and dust, so that his dearest friend could not"
4296,II,"have recognised his face.  Like flies buzzing round a milk pail, so"
4297,II,thronged the Greeks and Trojans round the body.
4298,II,
4299,II,"Zeus sat watching the battle, pondering in his heart what measure of"
4300,II,glory he should mete out to Patroclus before he laid him low by the arm
4301,II,"of Hector.  At last, having taken his resolve, he caused a coward"
4302,II,"spirit to enter into Hector's heart, and the Trojan captain wheeled his"
4303,II,"car, and fled towards the city.  The panic spread to the other Trojans,"
4304,II,"and the Lycians, and they retreated, leaving the body of Sarpedon in"
4305,II,"the hands of the Greeks, who despoiled it of its armour, and were about"
4306,II,to do it further dishonour when a higher power intervened.  In the very
4307,II,"act of violating the dead, they saw their lifeless victim snatched from"
4308,II,them by an invisible hand; for Apollo had received the commands of
4309,II,"Zeus, and bore away the soiled and blackened body to the riverside,"
4310,II,"where he washed it clean, anointed it with ambrosia, and gave it, robed"
4311,II,"in immortal raiment, into the charge of Sleep and Death, for safe and"
4312,II,speedy conveyance to Lycia.
4313,II,
4314,II,
4315,III,III
4316,III,
4317,III,High dreams of triumph arose in the heart of Patroclus when he saw the
4318,III,"enemy flying, and, forgetting the earnest injunction of Achilles, he"
4319,III,"bade Automedon lay on the lash, and followed in hot pursuit.  Even to"
4320,III,the very walls he drove; but then he found awaiting him one mightier
4321,III,"than Hector, even Apollo himself, who shook the ægis in his face, and"
4322,III,"warned him back.  Patroclus retired a little, and while he hesitated"
4323,III,"Apollo went to the gates of the city, where Hector was lingering, in"
4324,III,"doubt whether to continue the battle, or to withdraw behind the walls."
4325,III,
4326,III,"""What doest thou here, son of Priam?"" said the god; ""come with me, and"
4327,III,"I will show thee where the path of glory lies.""  When he heard Apollo's"
4328,III,"voice, Hector's courage returned, and he commanded Cebriones, his"
4329,III,"charioteer, to drive back to the battlefield.  Avoiding the other"
4330,III,"Greeks, Hector made straight for the place where Patroclus had been"
4331,III,"left standing by Apollo.  Patroclus came to meet him, holding his spear"
4332,III,"in his left hand, while in his right he grasped a jagged stone.  And as"
4333,III,"the car approached, he flung the stone with all his force, and struck"
4334,III,"Cebriones on the forehead, shattering the bones.  The reins dropped"
4335,III,"from his hands, and without a single cry he fell from the car, striking"
4336,III,"the ground with his head.  ""How bravely the man tumbles!"" cried"
4337,III,"Patroclus.  ""He would make a rare diver, and earn a good wage by"
4338,III,bringing up oysters from the sea.  I perceive that the Trojans can
4339,III,"dance, as well as the Cretans."""
4340,III,
4341,III,"Thereupon he leapt upon the prostrate charioteer, and Hector sprang"
4342,III,"forward to defend his comrade's body.  So there they met, like two"
4343,III,hungry lions fighting for the carcass of a stag; and the Greeks and
4344,III,"Trojans thronged on either side to their support, like two winds from"
4345,III,"opposite quarters, which shatter the boughs of beech and ash in a"
4346,III,mountain forest.  All the ground about the corpse was set thick with
4347,III,"javelins and arrows, and heaped with the stones which crashed upon"
4348,III,"corslet and shield.  And there lay the giant Trojan, while the battle"
4349,III,"raged above him, mighty and mightily fallen, and all his horsemanship"
4350,III,forgot.
4351,III,
4352,III,Never had the arm of Patroclus dealt such havoc among the foemen's
4353,III,"ranks as then; for his doom was near, and Zeus gave him honour in this,"
4354,III,"his latest hour.  Thrice he made an onset, fierce as the god of war"
4355,III,"himself, and thrice he slew nine men.  But when for the fourth time he"
4356,III,"sprang to the encounter, Ph[oe]bus made after him, and smote him on the"
4357,III,"back with his open hand.  Patroclus reeled and grew dizzy, like one who"
4358,III,"has received a sunstroke.  Then Apollo struck the helmet from his head,"
4359,III,"and it rolled clattering among the horses' feet, that mighty brazen"
4360,III,"helm, whose plumes, now soiled with dust and gore, had once waved above"
4361,III,the princely brow of Achilles.  The spear was shivered to pieces in his
4362,III,"hand, and his shield slipped from his shoulder to the ground.  And as"
4363,III,"he stood thus, defenceless and amazed, a Trojan, whose name was"
4364,III,"Euphorbus, wounded him between the shoulders with his spear.  The blow"
4365,III,"was not mortal, and Patroclus drew back, to mingle with the press; but"
4366,III,"Hector followed after him, and drove his spear deep into his side.  And"
4367,III,"as a lion overpowers a wild boar, fighting with him in the lone"
4368,III,"mountains for the possession of a little spring, and slays him by his"
4369,III,"might, so slew Hector the valiant son of Men[oe]tius, and stayed the"
4370,III,ravage of the Trojan ranks.
4371,III,
4372,III,"""Ah!  Patroclus,"" said he, gazing in triumph on the dying hero, ""thou"
4373,III,"thoughtest this day to have taken our city by storm, and led captive"
4374,III,the women of Troy.  But they have in me a defender who is too strong
4375,III,"for thee.  Vain man!  Achilles, I doubt not, bade thee bring back to"
4376,III,"him the bloody spoils of Hector, and now thou liest slain by Hector's"
4377,III,"hand."""
4378,III,
4379,III,"""Boast not,"" answered Patroclus faintly.  ""It is small glory for thee"
4380,III,to have slain the slain.  I received my death blow from Apollo and
4381,III,"Euphorbus, not from thee.  And thine own fate shall overtake thee soon,"
4382,III,"when thou shalt die by the hands of Æacides."""
4383,III,
4384,III,"Even as he spake the shadow of death fell upon him, and his soul took"
4385,III,"wing for the realm of Hades, bewailing her lot, leaving all that beauty"
4386,III,and manly bloom.

4392,III,
4393,I,I
4394,I,
4395,I,"Menelaus was the first to mark the fall of Patroclus, and he came with"
4396,I,"a rush and stood over his body to defend it, like a young mother of the"
4397,I,"herd when she stands lowing plaintively over her calf, the first that"
4398,I,"she has borne.  Shield on shoulder and spear in hand he stood, glaring"
4399,I,"defiance at the foe; and Euphorbus, the Trojan who had dealt the first"
4400,I,"blow at Patroclus, took up the challenge, addressing Menelaus with"
4401,I,"these haughty words: ""Make way, son of Atreus, and leave me to take my"
4402,I,"lawful spoil.  'Twas I that wounded Patroclus first, and his armour"
4403,I,"belongs by right to me.  Back, or thou shalt die the death."""
4404,I,
4405,I,"""If big words could kill,"" answered Menelaus, with scorn, ""then wert"
4406,I,thou and thy brethren the most dreaded warriors of all thy nation; for
4407,I,"there are no such windy braggarts in Priam's army.  Away with thee, if"
4408,I,"thou wouldst have breath left in thee to boast again."""
4409,I,
4410,I,"But Euphorbus, though a boaster, and a mere novice in war, was no"
4411,I,"coward.  He thrust manfully at Menelaus, who parried the blow with his"
4412,I,"shield, and then, striking in his turn, and throwing all his weight"
4413,I,"into the stroke, drove his spear into Euphorbus' throat, so that the"
4414,I,"point came out at the back of his neck.  Down he went, and his armour"
4415,I,"clattered upon him, and his love locks, curiously adorned with gold and"
4416,I,"silver, were dabbled with blood.  As when a man tends carefully a green"
4417,I,"olive-shoot, in some sheltered spot, near a gushing fountain-head; and"
4418,I,"now it is a comely tree, just bursting into blossom, and lightly rocked"
4419,I,"by all the airs of heaven: then comes a sudden tempest, and uproots it"
4420,I,"from the soil, and all its promise is marred: so stricken and cut off"
4421,I,in the dawn of his manhood lay that gallant lad.  And as a lion comes
4422,I,"down from the mountains, trusting in his might, and strikes down a"
4423,I,"young heifer feeding in a meadow, the fairest of the herd, breaking her"
4424,I,"neck with his mighty teeth, and then glutting himself with her blood"
4425,I,"and her flesh; and the herdsmen with their hounds stand apart, making"
4426,I,"great uproar, but not one dares to interrupt him in his meal: so dared"
4427,I,not one of the Trojans to stand against Menelaus face to face.
4428,I,
4429,I,"Hector, who after slaying Patroclus had gone off in pursuit of the car"
4430,I,"of Achilles, was recalled from that fruitless chase by the tidings of"
4431,I,"Euphorbus' death.  With a loud cry of rage he turned back, and hastened"
4432,I,"to the place where the young Trojan lay, side by side with Patroclus."
4433,I,"Menelaus stayed not to abide his coming, but fell back upon the ranks"
4434,I,"of his comrades, and there halted, and scanned the fighting line,"
4435,I,looking for the great Telamonian Ajax.  Observing him at last on the
4436,I,"extreme left of the battle, he ran up to him, crying eagerly: ""Make"
4437,I,"haste, Ajax, and aid me to recover the body of Patroclus, that we may"
4438,I,"carry it back, naked as it is, to Achilles; for the armour Hector has"
4439,I,"taken already."""
4440,I,
4441,I,"So together they went, and stood side by side over the body of"
4442,I,"Patroclus; and Hector in his turn shrank back, when he was confronted"
4443,I,"by the towering form of Ajax, with his massive, sevenfold shield.  But"
4444,I,"he took with him the armour, and gave it to two of his men to carry to"
4445,I,the city.
4446,I,
4447,I,"Glaucus was full of anger when he saw Hector quail before Ajax, and he"
4448,I,"reproached him bitterly, calling him faint-hearted, and false to his"
4449,I,"great office.  ""It is a thankless task,"" he said, ""to fight under such"
4450,I,a leader.  Henceforth let the Trojans make shift to defend their city
4451,I,"without our aid, for we of Lycia at least will fight their battles no"
4452,I,"more.  Basely hast thou dealt with us, after all our good service,"
4453,I,leaving our great captain Sarpedon in the hands of the Greeks.  If ye
4454,I,"of Troy had the spirit of men, ye would aid us to capture the body of"
4455,I,"Patroclus, that we might keep it to exchange for Sarpedon's corpse."
4456,I,"But thou art a prudent warrior, and fearest the face of Ajax, knowing"
4457,I,"him to be a far better man than thou art."""
4458,I,
4459,I,"""O folly of the wise!"" answered Hector scornfully.  ""'Tis Glaucus can"
4460,I,"talk thus, who hath the rarest wit, as we are told, among all the men"
4461,I,"of Lycia.  Come and stand by me, and thou shall see if I fear the face"
4462,I,"of Ajax, or any other Greek.  But first I will put on the armour of"
4463,I,"Achilles, which was given, men say, by the gods, as a wedding gift to"
4464,I,"his father Peleus.""  And with that he ran and overtook the men who were"
4465,I,"carrying the spoils of Patroclus towards the city, and taking off his"
4466,I,own armour began to put on that of Achilles.
4467,I,
4468,I,[Illustration: Homer hymning the Fall of Troy.  (Baron H. de Triqueti)]
4469,I,
4470,I,When Zeus beheld him thus gaily equipping himself in the spoils of the
4471,I,"mighty, he shook his head, and spake thus to his own heart: ""Ah!"
4472,I,"wretch, thy triumph will be short lived, and the hand of doom is"
4473,I,"stretched out already to take thee.  But thou shall have thine hour,"
4474,I,"and Andromache shall hear of thy deeds, though never more shall she"

4476,I,
4477,I,"He said it, and confirmed it with a nod, and forthwith the very demon"
4478,I,"of war entered into the heart of Hector, and with a fierce cry he ran"
4479,I,"back to the field, glittering in the armour of Pelides, which seemed to"
4480,I,"have been wrought for himself, so well it fitted his limbs."
4481,I,
4482,I,Even the great Ajax felt a cold touch of fear as Hector bore down upon
4483,I,"him, with the most famous warriors of Troy and Lycia at his back.  ""We"
4484,I,"are lost,"" he said to Menelaus, ""unless we can get some other succour"
4485,I,"to beat back this tempest of war.""  Then, raising his voice, he"
4486,I,"shouted: ""To the rescue, ye captains and princes of the Greeks!  Let"
4487,I,"not Patroclus become a prey to dogs in the streets of Troy.""  His cry"
4488,I,"was heard, and soon he was joined by Idomeneus, and Meriones, and the"
4489,I,lesser Ajax.
4490,I,
4491,I,"Like the roar of the advancing tide, when it meets the torrent waters"
4492,I,"at the mouth of the mighty river, such was the shout of the Trojans as"
4493,I,"they rushed to the onset.  And the Greeks stood firm to meet them,"
4494,I,making a fence with their shields over the body of Patroclus.  At the
4495,I,first shock of that tremendous charge they were forced to give ground a
4496,I,"little, and one of the Trojans fastened a thong to the ankle of the"
4497,I,"corpse, and began to drag it away.  But he had not gone far when Ajax"
4498,I,"sprang upon him, and with one blow of his sword shivered his helmet,"
4499,I,"and clave him to the chin.  This gave time for the Greeks to rally, and"
4500,I,the battle was renewed in that narrow space round the body of
4501,I,"Patroclus, where many a valiant deed was wrought, and many a hero bit"
4502,I,"the dust, fighting for the possession of a helpless corpse.  Over this"
4503,I,struggling mass of warriors in the centre of the field was spread a
4504,I,"thick curtain of darkness, for Zeus had ordered it so, while the rest"
4505,I,of the Greeks and Trojans were fighting in the broad sunlight.  Far
4506,I,"away on the border of the fight were Antilochus, the son of Nestor, and"
4507,I,"his brother, who had not yet heard that Patroclus had been slain."
4508,I,
4509,I,But in that dark kernel of the battle the ruthless tug of war went on.
4510,I,"There was no stay, no pause, while they hewed, and thrust, and strove,"
4511,I,"till the blinding sweat poured down into their eyes, and their knees"
4512,I,shook with weariness.  As when a master currier gives to his journeymen
4513,I,"a great bull's hide, well drenched with fat, to be stretched, and they"
4514,I,"stand in a circle, and tug with all their might, straining it equally"
4515,I,"on all sides, until all moisture departs from it, and the fat"
4516,I,"penetrates to every pore; so they tugged the body between them, this"
4517,I,"way and that, the Trojans haling it towards the city, and the Greeks"
4518,I,"towards their camp.  ""Die, ye Greeks!"" cried Ajax, who was fighting"
4519,I,"like twenty men; ""die, rather than give up the body to the Trojans."""
4520,I,
4521,I,
4522,II,II
4523,II,
4524,II,"After the fall of Patroclus, Automedon had driven his car out of the"
4525,II,"press of battle, flying from the fury of Hector.  When Hector was"
4526,II,"recalled from the pursuit, Automedon strove in vain to stir his horses"
4527,II,"from the spot where he had halted.  In vain he plied the lash, in vain"
4528,II,he coaxed and threatened; still as a monumental pillar on a tomb they
4529,II,"stood, with their heads drooping to the earth, and their glossy manes"
4530,II,"streaming over their eyes, while the hot tears dropped fast in the"
4531,II,"dust, as they wept for the gentle prince, whom they had borne so often"
4532,II,to battle.
4533,II,
4534,II,"Zeus pitied them in their sorrow, and spake thus within himself: ""Ah!"
4535,II,"hapless pair, why did we give you to a mortal master, while ye know"
4536,II,"neither age nor death?  What part or lot have ye with human misery, or"
4537,II,"with man, the most wretched thing that breathes and moves on earth?"
4538,II,"But Hector shall never mount the car behind you, or put the bit in your"
4539,II,"mouths--I will not suffer that.  Be strong, and bear your driver safe,"
4540,II,"until the battle be done."""
4541,II,
4542,II,"Therewith, he breathed new vigour into the steeds, and they shook the"
4543,II,"dust from their manes, and galloped lightly with the car back to the"
4544,II,"fighting lines.  Singlehanded, Automedon could take no part in the"
4545,II,"hand-to-hand battle with the Trojans, and for some time he contented"
4546,II,"himself with making rapid charges with his chariot, swooping down here"
4547,II,"and there, like an eagle pouncing on a flock of geese, and easily"
4548,II,avoiding every attack.  At last he found a helper in a comrade named
4549,II,"Alcimedon, and handing the reins to him he dismounted himself to fight"
4550,II,on foot.
4551,II,
4552,II,When Hector saw the car of Achilles in charge of a strange driver he
4553,II,"called to Æneas, and said: ""See, there are the steeds of Æacides,"
4554,II,"ill-guided, and ill-defended; let us not miss the occasion to win so"
4555,II,"glorious a prize.""  So together they went, Æneas and Hector, and two"
4556,II,"other Trojans, in high hope to slay Automedon, and take the car.  But"
4557,II,"Automedon, uttering a prayer to Zeus, flung his spear, and slew Aretus,"
4558,II,"one of his assailants; and before Hector, who missed his cast at"
4559,II,"Automedon, could come to close quarters with his sword, Ajax"
4560,II,"interposed, and drove him back."
4561,II,
4562,II,The arrival of Automedon had interrupted the struggle for the
4563,II,possession of the body of Patroclus; but it was resumed with new fury
4564,II,"on both sides, and the Greeks now received a new ally in the person of"
4565,II,"Athene, who obtained permission from Zeus to bring aid to her old"
4566,II,"allies.  Disguised in the form of the aged Ph[oe]nix, she went and"
4567,II,"stood by the side of Menelaus, and said to him: ""Courage, son of"
4568,II,"Atreus!  We shall win the battle yet, and save the noble comrade of"
4569,II,"Achilles from the foeman's hands."""
4570,II,
4571,II,"""Ah!  Ph[oe]nix,"" answered Menelaus, ""I would that Athene would put"
4572,II,"strength into my arm; then might I, as far as it is now possible,"
4573,II,"retrieve the bitter loss which we have suffered this day."""
4574,II,
4575,II,"Athene was glad that he had named her before any other god, and she"
4576,II,"filled him with an indomitable spirit, and gave him the stubborn"
4577,II,"courage of a fly, which returns again and again to the attack, in its"
4578,II,"fierce desire for blood.  And, seeing a good mark for his spear in the"
4579,II,"back of a flying Trojan, Menelaus flung, and pierced him in the waist."
4580,II,"The man whom he slew was Podes, a son of Eëtion, and a friend and boon"
4581,II,companion of Hector.  Provoked beyond measure by the death of his
4582,II,"comrade, Hector led such a determined charge against the Greek centre"
4583,II,that even the bravest began to flinch; and to affright them the more
4584,II,"there came a deafening peal of thunder from the heights of Ida, now"
4585,II,wrapped in a pitchy cloud.
4586,II,
4587,II,"The first to fly was Peneleos, the bravest of the B[oe]otians, whose"
4588,II,shoulder had been cut to the bone by the spear of Polydamas.  Then
4589,II,"Idomeneus, coming to succour a wounded Greek, broke his spear on"
4590,II,"Hector's breastplate, and it would have gone hard with him had not"
4591,II,"C[oe]ranus, a Cretan, driven up to the rescue in the car of Meriones;"
4592,II,"for Idomeneus had come to the field on foot, leaving his own car in the"
4593,II,"camp.  The brave C[oe]ranus paid for this good service with his life,"
4594,II,"sustaining a fearful thrust from Hector's spear, which struck him just"
4595,II,"at the angle of the jaw, and severed his tongue at the root.  He fell"
4596,II,"from the car, and dropped the reins on the ground; but Meriones picked"
4597,II,"them up, and gave them to Idomeneus, who drove off at full speed"
4598,II,towards the ships.
4599,II,
4600,II,"Thus deprived of his bravest supporters, Ajax cast a glance of dismay"
4601,II,"at Menelaus, who was still fighting at his side, and said: ""Alas! even"
4602,II,a blind man might see that Zeus himself is aiding the Trojans.  Every
4603,II,"weapon of theirs finds its mark, let it be hurled by ever so weak a"
4604,II,"hand; but our spears fall idle to the ground, one and all.  Yet,"
4605,II,"abandoned though we are, let us take thought how we may save the body"
4606,II,"of Patroclus, and ourselves return alive to gladden the eyes of our"
4607,II,"faithful comrades, who methinks are in sore distress, thinking that the"
4608,II,might and the murderous hands of Hector shall no more be stayed until
4609,II,they have hurled destruction on our fleet.  Also I would fain despatch
4610,II,"a messenger to bear the bitter tidings to Pelides, who dreams not that"
4611,II,his beloved Patroclus has perished.  But I cannot see anyone to whom I
4612,II,"might deliver this charge, for men and steeds alike are covered by"
4613,II,"thick darkness.  Dread sire of heaven, at least from darkness deliver"
4614,II,"the sons of Greece!  Bring back the day, and give us the sight of our"
4615,II,"eyes.  Slay us, if die we must--but slay us in the light!"""
4616,II,
4617,II,"Zeus had compassion on that brave man in his agony, and forthwith the"
4618,II,"thick cloud of darkness was removed, and the sun shone out, and all the"
4619,II,"field of battle was disclosed to view.  ""Now haste, Menelaus,"" said"
4620,II,"Ajax.  ""Go thou, and find Antilochus, who is very dear to Achilles, and"
4621,II,"bid him carry this message, which none other may dare to bring."""
4622,II,
4623,II,Menelaus was very reluctant to leave his place among the defenders of
4624,II,"Patroclus.  Slowly, and with many a backward glance, he turned to go,"
4625,II,like a lion who is driven off at dawn by a shower of javelins and
4626,II,"burning brands, after he has prowled all night round the stalls where"
4627,II,"fat oxen are housed.  ""Ah! remember,"" he said earnestly, pausing once"
4628,II,"more, ""remember how dear, how gentle he was to us all, this poor"
4629,II,"Patroclus, who now lies cold in death.  Forsake him not, but stand by"
4630,II,"him till I come back."""
4631,II,
4632,II,"After this fervent appeal he made all haste, and ran along the fighting"
4633,II,"line, looking about him with a piercing glance, like an eagle soaring"
4634,II,"high in the heaven, who spies out a hare as she crouches in the shadow"
4635,II,of a thicket.  So did the keen eye of Menelaus soon discern where
4636,II,"Antilochus was fighting, on the extreme left of the field.  ""Dire is"
4637,II,"the news I bring,"" said Menelaus, halting by his side: ""Patroclus is"
4638,II,"slain, Hector has his armour, and thou art chosen to tell Achilles of"
4639,II,"his loss, that if it be possible he may yet save the body."""
4640,II,
4641,II,"With parted lips, and eyes staring with horror, Antilochus stood gazing"
4642,II,at the bringer of the message of woe.  Then dashing the tears from his
4643,II,"eyes, and drawing a deep sobbing breath, he flung down his shield and"
4644,II,sped away on his mournful errand.
4645,II,
4646,II,"""I have sent him,"" said Menelaus, when he had returned with all speed"
4647,II,"to the defenders of the fallen Patroclus.  ""I know not what Achilles"
4648,II,"will do--he cannot fight without armour.  But to our task.""  ""The"
4649,II,"Trojans have drawn off a little,"" answered Ajax.  ""Now is the time: do"
4650,II,"thou and Meriones take the corpse on your shoulders, while I and my"
4651,II,"brother-in-arms hold the foe in play."""
4652,II,
4653,II,Without a moment's delay Menelaus and Meriones hoisted the body on
4654,II,their shoulders and began to carry it towards the camp: which when the
4655,II,"Trojans saw, they raised a great shout, and rushed after, like hounds"
4656,II,attacking a wounded wild boar; but as the hounds are scattered when the
4657,II,"great brute wheels to the charge, so fled the Trojans before the"
4658,II,determined stand of Ajax and his comrade.
4659,II,
4660,II,"But only for a moment: on they came again, fierce as a mighty"
4661,II,"conflagration, which sweeps through the streets of a town, driven"
4662,II,"before the gale, while the houses melt away like wax in the flames:"
4663,II,"with like furious uproar came horse and foot hard at their heels, as"
4664,II,they bore the body from the field.  But stoutly and stubbornly they
4665,II,"plodded on with their burden, panting and sweating like a pair of mules"
4666,II,which drag a heavy beam down a rugged mountain path: and behind them
4667,II,those two doughty champions opposed an impassable barrier to the
4668,II,"Trojans, like a long wooded mountain spur, which hurls back the fierce"
4669,II,"assault of a swollen stream, and cannot be broken."
4670,II,
4671,II,Yet even now the issue seemed doubtful; for just as the bearers reached
4672,II,"the barriers of the camp Hector and Æneas led a vigorous charge,"
4673,II,scattering the Greeks as a hawk scatters a noisy mob of starlings or
4674,II,daws.
4675,II,
4676,II,
4677,II,
4678,II,
4679,II,The News is brought to Achilles
4680,II,
4681,I,I
4682,I,
4683,I,"""Why tarries Patroclus so long?"" asked Achilles of himself, as he sat"
4684,I,"waiting by his tent.  ""Alas!  I fear that he hath disobeyed me, and"
4685,I,lost his life by his rashness.  Did not my mother tell me that the
4686,I,noblest of the Greeks should fall in battle with the Trojans while I
4687,I,"lived?""  His alarm increased when he saw straggling parties of the"
4688,I,"Greeks entering the camp, with every sign of panic and defeat."
4689,I,"Presently the roar of the struggle drew nearer and nearer, and he had"
4690,I,"just determined to rush to the ramparts, and learn the worst, when"
4691,I,"Antilochus came running up, and in broken accents panted out his"
4692,I,dreadful message.
4693,I,
4694,I,"As when a thunderbolt descends, laying low some giant of the forest, so"
4695,I,"fell the mighty Pelides, laid prostrate beneath that stunning blow."
4696,I,"Then that proud head, which had never bowed to mortal man, was defiled"
4697,I,"with dust, and those heroic limbs, the very mould of manly strength and"
4698,I,"beauty, grovelled and writhed on the ground.  He tore his hair, cast"
4699,I,"ashes on his head, and moaned like a wounded beast in his agony.  And"
4700,I,"all the handmaids whom he had taken in war gathered round him, wailing"
4701,I,"and beating their breasts; for sorrow was their portion, and their"
4702,I,"tears were ever ready to flow.  By his side knelt Antilochus, holding"
4703,I,"his hands, in fear lest he should do violence to his life."
4704,I,
4705,I,"Then Achilles shook off the grasp of Antilochus, and started to his"
4706,I,"feet with a fearful cry, glaring wildly, like one about to do some"
4707,I,desperate act.  But just at this moment a sound of female voices came
4708,I,"floating over the placid sea, and Thetis glided into his presence, with"
4709,I,all her band of Ocean nymphs attending.  Achilles flung himself down
4710,I,"again when he saw her, with a fresh burst of grief; and kneeling by him"
4711,I,"she embraced him tenderly, and weeping cried: ""O child of my sorrow,"
4712,I,what new cause of mourning hath reached thee now?  Hath not Zeus
4713,I,"fulfilled his promise, and avenged thine honour?"""
4714,I,
4715,I,"""What avails his promise, or the fulfilment thereof?"" answered"
4716,I,"Achilles, groaning bitterly.  ""What care I for honour, if I must pay"
4717,I,"for it with the life of my best beloved?  He lies in his blood, and"
4718,I,"Hector, his slayer, has taken the glorious armour which the gods gave"
4719,I,to Peleus when they made thee his unwilling bride.  'Twas a woeful
4720,I,"match, for thee and for me, and soon thou shall reap the bitter fruit,"
4721,I,"for Hector must die by my hand, to appease the ghost of Patroclus, and"
4722,I,"thou hast told me that, when Hector falls, my own end is not far off."""
4723,I,"A mournful silence followed, broken only by the sobs of Thetis, who"
4724,I,knew her son had pronounced his own doom.  Then Achilles burst out
4725,I,"again, in louder and angrier tones: ""But let me die, when that task is"
4726,I,"done!  What has life been to me?--a burden to myself, and a curse to"
4727,I,"others!  Here have I lain, like a useless trunk, encumbering the sod,"
4728,I,"and left my comrades to perish, and given him, the very light of mine"
4729,I,"eyes, to be a prey to the spoiler.  Accursed, and thrice accursed, be"
4730,I,"the spirit of strife, which trickles, sweeter than honey, into the"
4731,I,"hearts of men, and rises up again, in words more bitter than"
4732,I,"gall!--even as Agamemnon provoked me to fierce anger, which now comes"
4733,I,"back upon me, with thrice envenomed sting.  But past is past--we will"
4734,I,speak no more of that.  My fate calls me to vengeance--and after that
4735,I,"the grave.  Then away, soft visitings of love and gentle sorrow!  And"
4736,I,"thou, fond heart, become a stone!  I will strew with havoc the path"
4737,I,"which leads me to mine enemy, and the streets of Troy shall be filled"
4738,I,"with lamentation, and women wailing for their dead."""
4739,I,
4740,I,"""I know that I cannot shake thy purpose,"" answered Thetis sadly, ""and"
4741,I,it shall be as thou hast said.  But unarmed thou canst not go into
4742,I,"battle.  Remain here therefore until my return, and by to-morrow's dawn"
4743,I,"I will bring thee such armour as never mortal wore."""
4744,I,
4745,I,
4746,II,II
4747,II,
4748,II,"While these events were passing, the struggle over the slain Patroclus"
4749,II,raged fiercer than ever.  Slowly the Greeks were driven back to the
4750,II,"very gates of their camp, and at the eleventh hour that pitiful prize"
4751,II,which had cost so much blood would have fallen into the hands of the
4752,II,"Trojans, had not Hera intervened and sent Iris to summon Achilles to"
4753,II,the rescue.
4754,II,
4755,II,"""Rouse thee, son of Peleus!"" said Iris, appearing at his side.  ""Hector"
4756,II,"hath sworn to set the head of Patroclus on the battlements of Troy, and"
4757,II,"he will accomplish his threat if thou sittest idle here."""
4758,II,
4759,II,"""How can I go unarmed to the field?"" answered Achilles.  ""I know of"
4760,II,"none whose armour I might wear, save only Ajax, and he is fighting at"
4761,II,"the front."""
4762,II,
4763,II,"""No more words,"" replied Iris.  ""Do as thou art bidden, and heaven will"
4764,II,"find a way.""  Then Achilles arose, and went to the ramparts; and Athene"
4765,II,"drew near him, and threw her tasselled ægis over his shoulders, and on"
4766,II,"his head she caused a golden cloud to descend, which shot forth rays of"
4767,II,"angry light.  As in a beleaguered city, where a thousand watch-fires"
4768,II,"are lighted, and all day long the pillars of smoke ascend, but in the"
4769,II,"darkness the red blaze is seen afar, a signal of distress to distant"
4770,II,"allies--so shone that unearthly fire on the head of Achilles, as he"
4771,II,"stood on the brink of the moat.  Then he lifted up his voice, and"
4772,II,shouted; and the sound was as the sound of a trumpet summoning to arms.
4773,II,
4774,II,"When they saw the dreadful light, and heard the brazen voice of"
4775,II,"Pelides, the Trojans were astonished, and halted in the midst of their"
4776,II,"wild assault; and while they wavered the Greeks fell upon them, and"
4777,II,"drove them back in disorder.  The tide had turned at last, and the long"
4778,II,"day of battle, so full of strange revolutions of fortune, came to an"
4779,II,end.
4780,II,
4781,II,"Slowly and reverently the body of Patroclus was laid upon a bier, and"
4782,II,carried to the tent of Achilles.  But a few short hours before he had
4783,II,"gone forth, with horses and with chariots, to battle, in the pride of"
4784,II,"youth and strength; and now he lay cold in death, gored with hideous"
4785,II,wounds by Trojan spears.  And all night long Achilles and his comrades
4786,II,"mourned for their slaughtered hero, the gentlest and the best of all"
4787,II,their band.  Like a lion who leaves his whelps in their dark forest
4788,II,"lair, and returns to find his bed empty, and his young ones gone;"
4789,II,roaring with rage and grief he tracks the footsteps of the robber along
4790,II,"many a mountain path, and all the forest is filled with the sound of"
4791,II,"his wrath: such was Pelides in his sorrow, and such the voice of his"
4792,II,"mourning.  ""Vain, alas! was the promise which I made to thy father"
4793,II,"Men[oe]tius, that I would bring thee back safe to thy home in Locris,"
4794,II,"loaded with the spoils of Troy.  Thy blood is red on the Trojan sod,"
4795,II,where mine too shall flow before many days are passed.  Now hear my
4796,II,"vow, Patroclus, and take comfort, even in death I will not pay the last"
4797,II,"rites to thy corpse until I have brought Hector's body hither, with the"
4798,II,"armour which he has taken, and slain twelve Trojan captives as a"
4799,II,"sacrifice to thy shade.  Till then thou shalt lie as thou art, and the"
4800,II,"women of Troy, whom we won with the might of our hands, shall mourn"
4801,II,"thee night and day."""
4802,II,
4803,II,"Then they washed the body, and anointed it with fragrant oil, and laid"
4804,II,"it, wrapped in fine linen, on a bed to wait for burial."
4805,II,
4806,II,
4807,III,III
4808,III,
4809,III,"The Trojans still kept the field, though with far other feelings than"
4810,III,"when they lit their camp-fires, only the night before.  Before ever"
4811,III,"they thought of supper the chiefs met in council, and stood about in"
4812,III,"anxious groups, waiting until some recognised leader should advise them"
4813,III,"in their present strait.  Then Polydamas, who was esteemed the wisest"
4814,III,"head among them, came forward and commanded silence; and all listened"
4815,III,"attentive to hear what he should say.  ""Friends,"" he began, ""ye had"
4816,III,"best take heed what ye do; as for me, I have but one thing to"
4817,III,"advise--back to the city, and let not to-morrow's dawn find us here!"
4818,III,"We have all had our hopes, and I among the rest; but all those hopes"
4819,III,are fled now that Achilles has arisen again; and if we abide his coming
4820,III,we shall learn too late what it means to face him in the open field.
4821,III,"Here, where we stand, dogs and vultures will hold their foul revel, and"
4822,III,"batten on our flesh, at the going-down of the sun.  Therefore, I say"
4823,III,"again, back to the city, and put a stout bulwark of stone and oak"
4824,III,between yourselves and this terrible man.  To-morrow we will man the
4825,III,"walls, and laugh at his fury if he seeks to assail us there.  Yea, his"
4826,III,"steeds shall weary with drawing his car, and he himself shall sicken of"
4827,III,"the vain attempt, for he knows well that Troy is not destined to fall"
4828,III,"by his hands."""
4829,III,
4830,III,So ran the counsels of prudence; but another spirit was there also--the
4831,III,spirit of rash confidence and unauthorised ambition--and it found
4832,III,"passionate utterance in the voice of Hector, who was the next to speak."
4833,III,"""I like not thy words, Polydamas,"" said he, with an angry look; ""I like"
4834,III,not the cowardly counsel which bids us skulk behind our walls.  Who is
4835,III,not sick of our long confinement in that pinfold there?  We have
4836,III,"drained our treasury, and scattered abroad the wealth for which Troy"
4837,III,"was once famed throughout the world, wherever human speech is heard."
4838,III,But now that we have been vouchsafed the glorious promise of carrying
4839,III,"the war into the enemy's camp, and driving these hounds of war out of"
4840,III,"our land--now, I say, unlock no more the thoughts of thy base soul, to"
4841,III,"damp our courage, and quench the bright flame of hope which has been"
4842,III,kindled in our breasts.  Now hear what I advise: to-night we will hold
4843,III,"our camp here, and keep watch in turn; and to-morrow at first peep of"
4844,III,day we will put on our armour and march against the Grecian stronghold.
4845,III,"Achilles is arisen, sayest thou?  The worse for him: I will not fly"
4846,III,"before him, but will meet him face to face, and slay him, or be slain."""
4847,III,
4848,III,"The fiery eloquence of Hector carried his hearers with him, and they"
4849,III,"resolved with one accord to remain where they were, and abide the issue."

4854,III,The Shield of Achilles
4855,III,
4856,III,"Mindful of her promise, Thetis, when she left Achilles, went"
4857,III,straightway to Olympus and entered the dwelling of Hephæstus.  It was a
4858,III,"wondrous structure, all of brass, which the lame god had planned and"
4859,III,"fashioned by his own skill and labour.  She found him in his forge,"
4860,III,"blowing up the fire with his bellows; for he was hard at work, setting"
4861,III,"the finish to twenty brazen vessels, for use in his house.  Each vessel"
4862,III,"ran on golden wheels, and moved to and fro of its own accord, coming"
4863,III,"and going at the master's bidding.  With him sat Charis, his wife,"
4864,III,watching her husband at his toil; and when she saw Thetis enter she
4865,III,"came forward to greet her, and placed a chair, inlaid with silver, for"
4866,III,"her to sit on.  Then she called to Hephæstus, who was stooping over his"
4867,III,"forge, and said: ""Leave thy work, and come and welcome this honoured"
4868,III,"guest."""
4869,III,
4870,III,"""Welcome indeed she is, and honoured too,"" said the hospitable god,"
4871,III,"limping across the stithy with outstretched hands.  ""Did she not save"
4872,III,"me from my shrewish mother, who was ashamed of her crippled son, and"
4873,III,"sought to put me out of the way, when I was but a child?  Then it would"
4874,III,"have gone hard with me if Thetis had not received me into her home, the"
4875,III,"deep cavern, round which Oceanus wraps his watery coils, foaming and"
4876,III,"thundering everlastingly.  There I dwelt in peace for nine long years,"
4877,III,"and many a pretty jewel I wrought for my preservers--brooches, and"
4878,III,"bracelets and necklaces.  And none of the gods knew where I was, save"
4879,III,"only kind Thetis and Eurynome, daughter of Oceanus.  Therefore thrice"
4880,III,"welcome, sweet lady of the sea!  I owe thee my life, and shall be"
4881,III,"rejoiced if I can pay part of the debt.  Take her, dear Charis, to the"
4882,III,"guest-chamber, while I put away the implements of my trade."""
4883,III,
4884,III,"Thetis left the forge with her hostess, and when they were gone"
4885,III,"Hephæstus gathered up his tools, and turned the bellows away from the"
4886,III,"fire.  The tools he placed in a vast silver chest, and then taking a"
4887,III,"sponge he cleansed his face and hands, his brawny neck, and hairy"
4888,III,"chest.  Then he put on a clean tunic, and went to join Charis and her"
4889,III,"guest.  His huge heavy frame was ill supported on a pair of thin,"
4890,III,crooked legs; but his own inventive genius had enabled him to supply
4891,III,"this defect, for on either side of him walked a wonderful creature,"
4892,III,"wrought by himself in gold, with the form and face of a maiden, a human"
4893,III,"voice, and human wit.  Leaning on these strange supporters, he entered"
4894,III,"the guest-chamber, and sat down by the side of Thetis.  ""What need,"" he"
4895,III,"asked, ""has brought thee to my poor house--an angel's visit, indeed, to"
4896,III,"me, both rare and dear?"""
4897,III,
4898,III,"Encouraged by the cordial tone of the good-natured god, Thetis poured"
4899,III,"out afresh all the tale of her woes, beginning from the time when,"
4900,III,"sorely against her will, she became the bride of Peleus.  He was now an"
4901,III,"old man, broken and infirm, and she a goddess, radiant in her immortal"
4902,III,"bloom, was still chained to the human wreck, and Achilles, her son,"
4903,III,"still in the prime of his splendid manhood, was a perpetual source of"
4904,III,"trouble and grief.  ""Few indeed,"" she went on, ""and evil, are the days"
4905,III,"of his life.  First foully insulted by his sovereign, and now"
4906,III,broken-hearted at the loss of his dearest friend!  Help me to do what I
4907,III,"can to comfort him in this bitter hour; lend me thy skill, and make him"
4908,III,"a suit of armour such as never mortal man hath worn before."""
4909,III,
4910,III,"""If that be all,"" answered Hephæstus cheerfully, ""thy prayer is granted"
4911,III,"as soon as uttered.  Arms he shall have, which shall make him the"
4912,III,"wonder of the world when he goes forth to battle."""
4913,III,
4914,III,"Then leaving Thetis in charge of his wife he went back to his forge,"
4915,III,and having stripped to the waist addressed himself to his work.  Round
4916,III,"the furnace in the centre of the stithy were twenty pairs of bellows,"
4917,III,each serving a separate smelting oven.  These he now turned to the
4918,III,"fire, and commanded them to blow, for they were endowed with a"
4919,III,"consciousness of their own, and obeyed the master's will, now sending"
4920,III,"forth a tremendous blast, which made the fire roar with fury, and the"
4921,III,"flames leap upward to the roof, now breathing low, like some huge"
4922,III,monster in his softer mood.  Into the smelting ovens he cast bronze and
4923,III,"tin, silver and gold; and when his metal was ready he placed a"
4924,III,"ponderous anvil on the anvil block, and took in one hand a mighty"
4925,III,"hammer, while in the other he grasped the tongs."
4926,III,
4927,III,"And first a shield he fashioned, vast and strong,[1] with threefold"
4928,III,"rim, and baldric of silver.  The shield was of five folds; and on it he"
4929,III,wrought many a pictured scene with wondrous skill.
4930,III,
4931,III,
4932,III,[1] This line is from Cowper's version.
4933,III,
4934,III,
4935,III,"There were imaged earth and sea, the unwearied sun, and the moon in her"
4936,III,"waxing and her waning, and the heavens with all their starry"
4937,III,"crown--Pleiades, and Hyades, and Orion's might, and the Bear, whom men"
4938,III,"likewise call the Wain, who turns on the same spot, and watches Orion,"
4939,III,and alone has no share in the baths of Ocean.
4940,III,
4941,III,"And there was fashioned many a scene from human life, peace and war,"
4942,III,"pastime and industry.  The first was a city, and along the streets a"
4943,III,"bridal procession was passing, with blazing torches, and the loud"
4944,III,"hymeneal song, and the whirl of dancers, and the music of flute and"
4945,III,"harp; and the women stood at their thresholds, admiring that gay"
4946,III,company.  But in the market-place was heard the voice of loud dispute;
4947,III,"for the elders were met in their session, to decide a quarrel"
4948,III,concerning the blood-price of a murdered man.  The slayer brought
4949,III,witnesses to prove that he had paid the whole amount; but the plaintiff
4950,III,denied that he had received a doit.  Outside the circle stood the
4951,III,"clamorous mob, eager partisans of either side, and held in check by the"
4952,III,"heralds with their rods of office, and in the midst sat the elders in"
4953,III,"solemn conclave on their seats of polished stone, rising up in turn to"
4954,III,give sentence.  And he whose judgment was held wisest was to receive a
4955,III,reward of two talents of gold.
4956,III,
4957,III,"A second city there was, hard beset by stress of war.  For about it lay"
4958,III,"two armies encamped, whose counsels were divided: in one the leaders"
4959,III,"were for taking the city by storm, while in the other they would have"
4960,III,"made a treaty, by which the citizens were to buy off the attack with"
4961,III,"half their goods.  But while the besiegers were disputing, the citizens"
4962,III,"left their walls to be defended by the old men and the weaker sort, and"
4963,III,sallied out in full force to lay an ambush for a convoy which was on
4964,III,"its way to the enemy's camp.  So forth they marched, with Ares and"
4965,III,"Athene at their head, distinguished by their towering stature and"
4966,III,"golden armour.  And when they came to the chosen place of ambush, by"
4967,III,"the riverside, where was a watering-place for flocks and herds, they"
4968,III,"crouched down among the bushes, leaving two scouts to warn them of the"
4969,III,"convoy's approach.  Soon they heard the lowing of cattle, and the"
4970,III,"bleating of sheep, and the sound of the herdsmen's pipes, as they came"
4971,III,"on, dreaming of no harm; then forth rushed the armed troop, and cut"
4972,III,"down the herdsmen, and began to drive off the beasts."
4973,III,
4974,III,"The cries of the herdsmen, and the bellowing of the affrighted beasts,"
4975,III,"reached the ears of the besiegers, as they sat in council, and seizing"
4976,III,"their arms they mounted their horses, and hurried to the rescue.  Then"
4977,III,"began a furious struggle, in which all the demons of war--Strife, and"
4978,III,"Confusion, and deadly Fate--held high carnival, and drank deep of human"
4979,III,blood.[2]
4980,III,
4981,III,
4982,III,[2] It should be observed that the poet gives the whole succession of
4983,III,"incidents which are merely hinted at by the artist, who is confined to"
4984,III,one moment in the story.
4985,III,
4986,III,
4987,III,Then followed diverse scenes of happy toil.  The first was a fair
4988,III,"fallow land of rich tilth, where ploughmen were driving their teams to"
4989,III,"and fro, drawing long furrows, straight and deep, and pausing now and"
4990,III,"then to refresh themselves with a cup of wine, which was handed to them"
4991,III,by a man who stood ready at the end of the field.  Dark rose the
4992,III,"curling furrow, as the ploughshare passed, and the sods seemed of rich"
4993,III,"black soil, though wrought in gold; for therein was displayed the"
4994,III,artist's skill.
4995,III,
4996,III,"The next was a harvest of yellow corn, and a row of busy reapers with"
4997,III,"sharp sickles in their hands.  Others stood ready to bind the sheaves,"
4998,III,"and these again were supplied by a willing troop of boys, who gathered"
4999,III,"up the swathe as fast as it fell, and handed the ripe bundles to the"
5000,III,"binders.  Near at hand stood the master, rejoicing in his wealth; and"
5001,III,under a tree at the border of the field the henchmen were slaughtering
5002,III,"an ox, to make savoury meat for him and his guests, while women were"
5003,III,preparing a mess of pottage for the reapers.
5004,III,
5005,III,"Likewise he fashioned a vineyard, heavy with great clusters of grapes,"
5006,III,"and along the rows moved a merry troop of boys and girls, with baskets"
5007,III,"in their hands, gathering the luscious fruit; and when their baskets"
5008,III,"were full they brought their burdens home with dancing steps, led by a"
5009,III,boy who played the harp and sang the sweet dirge of summer in his
5010,III,"shrill, childish voice."
5011,III,
5012,III,"Then came a herd of oxen going to pasture, and lowing as they went"
5013,III,"along the waving rushes, along the murmuring stream.  Four herdsmen"
5014,III,"followed, and with them were nine dogs.  But lo! a noble bull, the"
5015,III,"leader of the herd, falls suddenly in his tracks, struck down by the"
5016,III,"claws of two ravening lions.  They begin to drag him off, and the"
5017,III,"herdsmen follow at a distance, cheering on their dogs, which leap and"
5018,III,"bay wildly, but will not close with those terrible robbers."
5019,III,
5020,III,"The last scene of all was a dance of youths and maidens, the youths"
5021,III,"clad in close-fitting doublets, and wearing hangers at their sides, and"
5022,III,"the maidens wearing light garments of linen, and circlets of gold on"
5023,III,"their heads.  Holding one another by the wrist, they first moved in a"
5024,III,"giddy circle, swift and true as the wheel flies in the potter's hands,"
5025,III,"and then they parted in two rows, and met again, weaving and unweaving"
5026,III,"all the mazy figures of a Cretan dance, while two tumblers whirled"
5027,III,"among them, and a singer gave the time with his voice."
5028,III,
5029,III,Framing this rich succession of pictures ran the broad stream of
5030,III,"Oceanus, rolling his waters round the outer rim of the shield."
5031,III,
5032,III,"Corslet, and greaves, and helmet with crest of gold, were fashioned"
5033,III,"next, and when the great work was done, Hephæstus brought it and laid"
5034,III,"it at the feet of Thetis.  After due thanks, she took leave of her"
5035,III,"generous friends, and then sped on her way to the Grecian camp, bearing"
5036,III,the costly gift of Hephæstus to her son.

5044,I,
5045,I,Dawn was beginning to redden the waters of the Hellespont when Thetis
5046,I,"reached the tent of Achilles.  She found him sitting, lost in a gloomy"
5047,I,"reverie, by the side of the bed on which the body of Patroclus lay."
5048,I,"""Come,"" said Thetis, touching him lightly on the shoulder, ""let the"
5049,I,"dead bury their dead, and behold the glorious armour which Hephæstus"
5050,I,"has wrought for thee."""
5051,I,
5052,I,"With that she set down the dazzling panoply, fresh from the forge of"
5053,I,"the god; the ethereal metal rang with a dreadful sound, and from the"
5054,I,"burnished surface darted angry beams of light, blinding the eyes of the"
5055,I,"Myrmidons who had drawn near to gaze, so that they fled in terror from"
5056,I,"the sight.  But the eyes of Achilles flashed with an answering fire,"
5057,I,"and his heart burned with fierce joy, as he handled the work of the"
5058,I,"immortal armourer.  ""Mother,"" he said, when he had scrutinised every"
5059,I,"piece, ""the work is worthy of the artist--I can say no more.  And now"
5060,I,to battle!  Yet one thing I fear--lest the body of my friend be marred
5061,I,"by decay before my vow is accomplished and I am free to bury him."""
5062,I,
5063,I,"""Let not that care disquiet thee,"" answered Thetis, ""I will find a"
5064,I,"means to keep off the destroying hordes of the air, that breathe"
5065,I,corruption in the limbs of fallen warriors.  Though he lie unburied for
5066,I,"the space of a whole year, his flesh shall remain pure and clean, as"
5067,I,the flesh of a little child.  Now go thou and summon the Greeks to the
5068,I,"place of assembly, that when thou hast renounced thy feud with"
5069,I,"Agamemnon, thou mayest gird thee with might and go forth to battle."""
5070,I,"Then she brought nectar and ambrosia, and embalmed therewith the body"
5071,I,"of Patroclus, that his flesh might remain sound and whole."
5072,I,
5073,I,"But Achilles strode rapidly along the strand, shouting as he went to"
5074,I,call the people to the assembly.  And forthwith from every tent the
5075,I,"multitude came flocking, and not one remained behind, no, not even"
5076,I,"those who pursued peaceful crafts, and were not wont to take part in"
5077,I,the councils of the armed host.  For not one was willing to be absent
5078,I,from that memorable meeting.
5079,I,
5080,I,"As he passed on, he overtook Odysseus and Diomede, who were limping"
5081,I,"painfully along, leaning on their spears; for they were still sore with"
5082,I,"their wounds.  After a few words of greeting, he left them to follow,"
5083,I,and went forward to the place where the chiefs were sitting round the
5084,I,"throne of Agamemnon, which was still vacant.  It was a level spot, in"
5085,I,"the centre of a natural hollow, whose sides rose gently, until they"
5086,I,were closed by a background of waving woods.  And now all the slopes
5087,I,"were black with a swarming multitude, armed and unarmed, stout"
5088,I,"spearmen, and noisy rabble.  At last Agamemnon was seen approaching,"
5089,I,"moving slowly and with pain.  He took his seat on the royal throne, and"
5090,I,"then a dead hush fell on all that vast company, as Achilles rose in his"
5091,I,"place, and began to speak."
5092,I,
5093,I,"""Great King,"" he said, ""we are met to end the lamentable feud which"
5094,I,arose out of our quarrel for the sake of the maid Briseis.  Would that
5095,I,"she had never been born, or had been stricken with sudden death by the"
5096,I,"gentle shafts of Artemis, before ever she had put enmity between me and"
5097,I,thee!  So would many a brave man have been alive and well who now lies
5098,I,"sleeping an iron sleep.  Yes, for many a year to come the Greeks will"
5099,I,"speak of the wrath of Achilles, and of him who was the cause.  But here"
5100,I,"it ends: my wrath is now aimed at another mark, and once more I am thy"
5101,I,"faithful friend and ally.  War, war without quarter or mercy--that is"
5102,I,all I ask for now.  Let us see if the Trojans will hold their camp at
5103,I,"our gates when they stand beneath the shadow of my destroying spear."""
5104,I,
5105,I,Right glad were the Greeks to learn that the tremendous passions of
5106,I,Achilles were now enlisted on their side.  But their joyful cries were
5107,I,changed to murmurs of resentment when Agamemnon rose to answer; for
5108,I,they saw in him the author of all their disasters.  Signs of remorse
5109,I,and confusion appeared in his face; and the first words of his speech
5110,I,"were heard with difficulty amidst the tumult.  ""Friends and comrades in"
5111,I,"arms,"" he began, ""I beseech you to hear me with patience, while I make"
5112,I,"confession of my fault.  I have sinned, I cannot deny it, through the"
5113,I,"dread power of Ate,[1] who blinded my heart, and maimed my wits, on the"
5114,I,"day when I took from Achilles his prize.  Ah! she is a fearful goddess,"
5115,I,"this Ate, a fiend to vex mankind.  Soft is her tread, and her path lies"
5116,I,"on the heads of men: unseen, unheard, she approaches, and enters into"
5117,I,the soul of him whom she has marked for ruin.  Once she dwelt among the
5118,I,"gods in Olympus, but she dared to lay her foul spells on Zeus himself,"
5119,I,so that he fell into grievous error; and when he learnt how he had been
5120,I,"deceived, he swore a mighty oath that never again should that abhorred"
5121,I,"witch set foot in the celestial abode.  So he caught her by the hair,"
5122,I,"and flung her down to earth, to plague the tribes of men.  And she it"
5123,I,"was who made me her victim, whereby all this mischief befell.  But now"
5124,I,"I am ready to make all good, and heal the wrong which I have wrought."
5125,I,And all the gifts which I promised yesterday by the mouth of Odysseus
5126,I,"are thine, Achilles, without abatement of one jot.  Wait awhile, before"
5127,I,"thou goest into battle, and my squires shall bring them to thy tent."""
5128,I,
5129,I,
5130,I,[1] A personification of moral blindness.
5131,I,
5132,I,
5133,I,"""As for the gifts,"" replied Achilles, ""they are thine to give or to"
5134,I,"withhold as thou choosest.  But of that hereafter; for the present, I"
5135,I,"have work to do which admits of no delay.  No more of talk, but let us"
5136,I,"away to the field at once."""
5137,I,
5138,I,"But here the voice of prudence intervened, checking the fiery"
5139,I,"impetuosity of Achilles.  ""Hear me a moment, valiant prince,"" said"
5140,I,"Odysseus.  ""We must not lead the people fasting to battle, for an empty"
5141,I,"man hath little heart for the fight, which methinks will be neither"
5142,I,"short nor easy to-day.  Let the people first eat their fill, for a man"
5143,I,cannot face the foe from dawn till eve without tasting meat.  However
5144,I,"willing his spirit, his flesh is weak; his limbs are soon overtaken"
5145,I,"with weariness, his mouth is parched with thirst, and his knees totter"
5146,I,"as he goes.  Therefore, I say, let us eat, and after that to battle."
5147,I,"And thou, Achilles, shalt receive the gifts of Agamemnon, and partake"
5148,I,of a banquet of honour with the other chieftains in his tent.  The King
5149,I,"knows what is fitting, and he cannot do less."""
5150,I,
5151,I,"Agamemnon willingly assented, and was proceeding to give the order to"
5152,I,"bring the gifts when Achilles started up again, in eager protest"
5153,I,against this delay.
5154,I,
5155,I,"""Illustrious King,"" he said, ""surely there will be time enough to speak"
5156,I,"of these lesser matters when we have humbled the pride of the Trojans,"
5157,I,"who are waiting for us on the plain.  My friend lies slaughtered,"
5158,I,"pierced by Hector's spear, and ye talk to me of meat and drink!  By my"
5159,I,"will the whole army should keep a solemn fast, until we have washed out"
5160,I,"the stain on our honour in a sea of blood, and then, after the great"
5161,I,"act of vengeance is complete, we will feast and make merry.  I at least"
5162,I,will suffer no morsel or drop to pass my lips as long as my comrade
5163,I,"lies in my tent with his feet to the door, and the women mourning"
5164,I,"round.  No; far other thoughts fill my heart--blood and slaughter, and"
5165,I,"the groans of dying men."""
5166,I,
5167,I,But these desperate counsels found no favour with the veteran heads of
5168,I,"the army, and a deep hum of approval greeted the more sober eloquence"
5169,I,"of Odysseus, who now rose again to reply.  ""Mighty son of Peleus,"" he"
5170,I,"said, ""thou art stronger far than I, and thy spear writes deadlier"
5171,I,"record on the foemen's ranks; but I have lived longer than thou, and"
5172,I,"seen more: bear with me, then, while I speak what reason and experience"
5173,I,hath taught me.  Soon weary grows the hand which toils in war's barren
5174,I,"harvest, where the swathe is so thick, and the yield so scanty when the"
5175,I,day is done.  We cannot keep a fast for every Greek that falls--where
5176,I,"would be the end?  The warrior's dirge is short, and he is honoured"
5177,I,"enough if he is mourned for a day.  And those who are left must eat,"
5178,I,"that they may have strength to fight on the morrow.  To your tents,"
5179,I,"then, every one!  And when ye have eaten, come quickly, armed for the"
5180,I,"fight, and await no second summons."""
5181,I,
5182,I,"For all his fierce impatience, Achilles was compelled to yield.  With"
5183,I,"great effort he controlled himself while the gifts were brought, and"
5184,I,"the ceremonies performed, with no circumstance of solemnity omitted, to"
5185,I,ratify the covenant of forgiveness and reconciliation between him and
5186,I,Agamemnon.  And so the first act in the great drama of his wrath is
5187,I,concluded.
5188,I,
5189,I,
5190,II,II
5191,II,
5192,II,"Seven youths of princely rank, attended by a long train of bearers,"
5193,II,"were despatched to the tent of Achilles, loaded with the costly gifts"
5194,II,"of atonement from the King.  With them went Briseis, thus returned to"
5195,II,"her former lord.  When she saw Patroclus on the bed where he lay, she"
5196,II,"beat her breast, and, embracing the cold body, burst into a passion of"
5197,II,"weeping.  ""Friend of my sorrow!"" she cried, ""I left thee living, and I"
5198,II,"find thee dead.  Woe, and more woe, is all my portion.  When I came"
5199,II,"hither, an orphaned captive, bereaved of all, thou didst comfort me in"
5200,II,"my great affliction, promising, when the war was over, to make me"
5201,II,Achilles' lawful wife.  Thy gentleness and thy knightly courtesy shed
5202,II,"balm upon my wounded spirit, and now thou art gone, and my last comfort"
5203,II,"is gone with thee."""
5204,II,
5205,II,"So mourned Briseis, and all the captive ladies wept afresh when they"
5206,II,"heard her, having cause enough for tears, every one.  The sound of"
5207,II,"their lamentation reached the ears of Achilles where he sat, but he"
5208,II,"remained unmoved by the tragedy of these lesser spirits, being absorbed"
5209,II,in the sense of his own great loss.  The tide of his passion had ebbed
5210,II,"again, leaving his heart cold and desolate.  His men brought him food"
5211,II,"and drink, but he repulsed them sternly, and would touch nothing.  He"
5212,II,thought of the happy past--when he and Patroclus had partaken together
5213,II,"of many a cheerful meal--and then of the bitter present, when the sight"
5214,II,of bread and meat filled him with loathing.  He thought of his father
5215,II,"Peleus, growing old in his solitary home, waiting in sad expectation to"
5216,II,"hear of his son's death, and of the young Neoptolemus, his own child,"
5217,II,"growing up among strangers in the island of Scyros.  ""Lost, lost, all"
5218,II,"lost!"" he murmured; ""I shall never see them again."""
5219,II,
5220,II,But the gods had not forgotten their favourite.  Zeus beheld him as he
5221,II,"sat thus stricken and forlorn, and sent Athene to inspire him with new"
5222,II,"comfort and strength.  Unseen, she alighted at his side, and fed him,"
5223,II,"though he knew it not, with heavenly food, filling his heart with more"
5224,II,than mortal vigour and courage.  Meanwhile the clash of arms rang
5225,II,"through the camp as the Greeks marched out, column after column, to"
5226,II,"battle, thick as autumnal leaves, or hovering snowflakes in winter."
5227,II,"The air seemed on fire with the flash of myriads of spears, and the"
5228,II,earth shook beneath the thunder of their tread.
5229,II,
5230,II,"Roused by the sound, Achilles sprang to his feet, and buckled on his"
5231,II,"corslet, and clasped the greaves to his ankles.  Then he flung the"
5232,II,"sword over his shoulder, and thrust his arm through the strap of his"
5233,II,"shield, which shone like the full-orbed moon, or a beaconlight blazing"
5234,II,"afar over a stormy sea.  Last of all, he lifted his mighty helmet, with"
5235,II,"its nodding, golden plume, and set it on his head.  And now, being"
5236,II,"arrayed in his harness from head to foot, he raised himself to his"
5237,II,"towering height, and stretched his fleet limbs, to prove the armour;"
5238,II,"and it became unto him as wings, making him lighter and nimbler than"
5239,II,ever before.
5240,II,
5241,II,"Grasping in his right hand his spear--the mighty Pelian ash, pointed"
5242,II,"with death--he went forth before the tent, where Automedon stood"
5243,II,"waiting with his car.  ""Now hear me, ye children of the wind!"" he"
5244,II,"cried, addressing his steeds, ""see that ye play me not false to-day, as"
5245,II,"when ye left Patroclus dead on the field, and came back with an empty"
5246,II,"car."""
5247,II,
5248,II,"Then there befell a wondrous thing; for the good steed Xanthus,"
5249,II,"drooping low his head, answered with a human voice, and spake thus unto"
5250,II,"his master: ""Yea, we will carry thee safe back, most dread Achilles,"
5251,II,when the fight is o'er.  It was by no sloth or tardiness of ours that
5252,II,thy brave comrade met his death; that deed was wrought by the hand of
5253,II,"Apollo, using Hector as his instrument--even as thou too shalt be cut"
5254,II,"off by a human weapon, but by no human power."""
5255,II,
5256,II,"So spake the immortal courser, for the first and the last time; for"
5257,II,"fate suffered it not again.  And Achilles answered him, and said:"
5258,II,"""Waste not thy prophecies on me, good steed!  I know my fate--death on"
5259,II,"the battlefield, far from my home: but ere that hour comes I will send"
5260,II,"many a Trojan to herald my coming among the dead."""
5261,II,
5262,II,"Then, shouting his dread battle-cry, he sprang into his car, and drove"
5263,II,headlong to the front.

5267,II,
5268,II,Achilles in the Battlefield
5269,II,
5270,I,I
5271,I,
5272,I,By high permission of all-ruling Jove the gods were now free to take
5273,I,"part in the war, and they all with one accord came down from Olympus to"
5274,I,"mingle with the fray.  Only Zeus remained behind, as supreme arbiter of"
5275,I,"the final issue.  All the rest took sides with the Greeks or Trojans,"
5276,I,and five rival pairs confronted each other in the field--Poseidon found
5277,I,"a match in Apollo, the great ally of the Trojans--Hera, who loved the"
5278,I,"Greeks like a mother, was confronted by the archer-goddess"
5279,I,"Artemis--against Athene stood Ares, whose fickle mind now inclined to"
5280,I,"the Trojans--Hermes, who favoured the Greeks, was met on the other side"
5281,I,"by Leto, the mother of Artemis and Apollo--and lastly Hephæstus and"
5282,I,"Scamander, the opposing powers of fire and water, took the field, the"
5283,I,"former for the Greeks, the latter for the Trojans."
5284,I,
5285,I,All nature was in uproar as these tremendous allies entered the scene
5286,I,"of conflict.  Earth shook, and the mountains reeled to their"
5287,I,"foundations, and the towers of Troy and the Grecian ships reeled as in"
5288,I,"an earthquake.  Then trembling came upon Hades, the monarch of the"
5289,I,"dead, and leaping from his throne he cried aloud in fear, lest the"
5290,I,"earth, rent by Poseidon's trident, should disclose to mortal and"
5291,I,"immortal eyes the dank and dreary mansions of the dead, which even the"
5292,I,gods abhor.
5293,I,
5294,I,Far in front of the Grecian line was seen the glittering form of
5295,I,"Achilles, who scanned the Trojan ranks like a lion who seeks his prey,"
5296,I,"having but one thought, but one aim--to meet Hector, and slay him.  But"
5297,I,"Hector's hour was not yet come, for Apollo stood near to shield him"
5298,I,"from his great enemy, and delay the fatal stroke which sooner or later"
5299,I,must lay him low.  And first the god put it into the heart of Æneas to
5300,I,"defy Achilles to battle, and gave him unwonted courage and strength,"
5301,I,that he might not flinch in that fearful encounter.  Then Æneas heard a
5302,I,"voice which whispered within him, and seemed to say: ""Art thou not the"
5303,I,"son of Aphrodite, who is the daughter of supreme Jove?  Why fearest"
5304,I,"thou then this upstart child of Thetis, of far meaner lineage than"
5305,I,"thine?  Go face him, and let him learn that neither are the Trojans"
5306,I,"forsaken of heaven."""
5307,I,
5308,I,"So between the advancing lines they met, both sons of gods, but far"
5309,I,different in their fate.  At first Achilles had not observed his
5310,I,"approach, but stalked, heedless of all lesser foes, before the"
5311,I,"embattled host of Troy, like a lion bent on ravage, against whom a"
5312,I,"whole township is gathered, with purpose to slay him and at first he"
5313,I,"goes on his way, disdaining the menaces of that rabble rout--but then,"
5314,I,"being pricked by the point of a random spear, he gathers himself,"
5315,I,"foaming and gnashing his teeth, for the spring, and his mighty spirit"
5316,I,"groans within him, and he lashes his flanks on both sides with his"
5317,I,"tail, goading himself to battle--then glaring and roaring he launches"
5318,I,"his vast weight at the foe, resolved to kill or be killed--so sprang"
5319,I,"Achilles against Æneas, in wrath at his presumption."
5320,I,
5321,I,"""What wouldst thou of me, Æneas?"" he cried, in disdainful mood.  ""Have"
5322,I,"the Trojans promised thee a fair estate, if thou take my life?  Or"
5323,I,"hopest thou, perchance, to sit in the seat of Priam, if thou accomplish"
5324,I,this great deed?  I thought thou hadst had enough of me and my spear.
5325,I,"Hast thou forgotten when I chased thee through the glades of Ida,"
5326,I,having caught thee alone among the grazing herds?  Then didst thou
5327,I,"never turn thy head to look back, until thou hadst reached the shelter"
5328,I,"of a fenced city.  And I sacked the city, and led captive the women;"
5329,I,"but thou didst escape me again, through the special mercy of Zeus.  Go"
5330,I,"back, vain man, and join the press of thy comrades or thou shalt not"
5331,I,escape me now.
5332,I,
5333,I,"""Who art thou?"" answered Æneas, undaunted, ""that thinkest to affright"
5334,I,"me with boastful words, as if I were a witless boy?  Know, proud man,"
5335,I,"that I am of higher descent than thine, for in my veins flows the royal"
5336,I,"blood of Dardanus, mingled with the blood of gods.  Go to, let us"
5337,I,"wrangle no more like women in the market-place, but decide the quarrel"
5338,I,"with our spears."""
5339,I,
5340,I,"As he spoke, he cast his spear, which struck with strong impact against"
5341,I,"the shield of Achilles; and he, when he felt the shock, held the shield"
5342,I,"away from his body, fearing that the point would pass through and reach"
5343,I,his flesh.  But immortal armour is not easy to be pierced by mortal
5344,I,"weapons, and the spear dropped harmless to the earth.  Then Achilles"
5345,I,"flung in his turn, and the spear tore its way through the upper rim of"
5346,I,"Æneas' shield: and he, stooping low, heard the rush of the mighty"
5347,I,"lance, as it flew over his head, and buried itself in the ground behind"
5348,I,"him.  Having thus both missed their cast, they prepared to renew the"
5349,I,"struggle hand to hand.  Achilles drew his sword, and rushed to the"
5350,I,"encounter with a fierce cry: while Æneas lifted a heavy stone, and"
5351,I,stood ready to hurl it as his antagonist drew near.
5352,I,
5353,I,"But that combat, which must have ended fatally for the Trojan, was not"
5354,I,"destined to be fought out to its end.  ""Behold,"" said Poseidon, who was"
5355,I,"watching the unequal duel, to Hera, who sat near him, ""my spirit is"
5356,I,"troubled because of Æneas, whom his own rashness, and the evil counsels"
5357,I,"of Apollo, are leading to his doom.  But this must not be: he is"
5358,I,"reserved for a better fate, which shall be accomplished after the"
5359,I,towers of Troy have been levelled with the dust.  In him shall the line
5360,I,"of Dardanus be preserved, and from him shall be born a mighty race, to"
5361,I,"found a new empire on the ruins of the old.""[1]"

5363,I,
5364,I,[1] These lines contain the germ of the _Æneid_.
5365,I,
5366,I,
5367,I,"""Do as thou wilt,"" answered Hera.  ""As for me, I have sworn a great"
5368,I,"oath that I will never save a Trojan from perishing, no, not in the"
5369,I,"last fatal hour when Troy shall be consumed with fire."""
5370,I,
5371,I,"When Poseidon heard that, he went and stood between the fighting"
5372,I,"champions; and on the eyes of Achilles he shed a thick darkness, that"
5373,I,he might not see what was done.  Then he drew the spear from the shield
5374,I,"of Æneas, and threw it at Achilles' feet; and catching up the Trojan"
5375,I,prince in his hand he bore him aloft over the heads of the Greeks and
5376,I,"Trojans, until he reached the utmost verge of the battlefield.  There"
5377,I,"he set him down, and, becoming visible in all his divine majesty,"
5378,I,"addressed him in these solemn words of warning: ""Æneas, what put this"
5379,I,"mad thought into thy heart, to fight against Achilles, who is both"
5380,I,"stronger than thou and dearer to the gods?  Tempt not thy fate again,"
5381,I,"but when thou meetest him avoid his spear; and after he is slain, then"
5382,I,"mayest thou boldly encounter the bravest of the Greeks, for no other"
5383,I,"hath power to do thee hurt."""
5384,I,
5385,I,
5386,II,II
5387,II,
5388,II,When the darkness fell from the eyes of Achilles he looked round about
5389,II,"him, and saw his spear lying at his feet, but sought in vain for Æneas."
5390,II,"""What wonder is this?"" he said to himself; ""the spear is returned to"
5391,II,"me, but mine enemy is vanished.  Surely the gods love him also, though"
5392,II,I deemed that he boasted idly.  Let him go!  It will be long before he
5393,II,"desires to face me again."""
5394,II,
5395,II,"Then, shouting to the Greeks to support him, he fell upon the main body"
5396,II,"of the Trojans, seeking everywhere for Hector; and finding him not (for"
5397,II,Apollo as yet withheld the Trojan patriot from his eyes) he began to
5398,II,"deal out indiscriminate slaughter wherever he went.  A brave Lycian,"
5399,II,"the son of a mountain nymph, who rushed to attack him, was his first"
5400,II,victim; with one blow of that tremendous spear his head was shattered
5401,II,"as with a battering-ram, and he fell beneath the feet of the horses,"
5402,II,and the wheels of the car passed over his body.
5403,II,
5404,II,Among the many who went to swell the list of the slain that day was
5405,II,"Polydorus, a favourite son of Priam, who loved him as his youngest"
5406,II,"born, and who had forbidden him to go into battle.  But he, trusting in"
5407,II,"the speed of his feet, had come to the field the day before, and now"
5408,II,"appeared in the van of the Trojans, a graceful and agile youth, lovely"
5409,II,and pleasant to behold.  But as he pursued his gay career a javelin
5410,II,"from the hand of Achilles pierced his armour at the waist, and he fell,"
5411,II,torn in the midst by a hideous wound.
5412,II,
5413,II,"Hector saw his brother fall, and full of rage and grief sprang forward"
5414,II,to avenge his death.  When Achilles saw his great enemy at last within
5415,II,"his reach he leapt towards him with a loud and exultant cry: ""Draw"
5416,II,"near, and pay the price of my comrade, whom thou hast slain!""  ""Proud"
5417,II,"man, I fear thee not,"" answered Hector, undismayed: ""I know that thou"
5418,II,"art far mightier than I, but nevertheless I defy thee, and trust that"
5419,II,"heaven will lend keenness to my spear."""
5420,II,
5421,II,"But the end was not yet.  Apollo intervened to save the gallant Trojan,"
5422,II,and bore him away wrapped in a cloud of darkness.  Three times Achilles
5423,II,"struck, and three times his spear smote idly on the empty air.  ""Thou"
5424,II,"dog!"" he cried at last, finding his efforts unavailing, ""Thou hast"
5425,II,"avoided me now, but I will destroy thee yet, for I have friends among"

5430,II,"underwood, and thrusting out its red fangs to devour the tall trees, so"
5431,II,"raged Pelides in the fury of slaughter, and the earth ran red with"
5432,II,blood.  And as two broad-browed steers move to and fro on a
5433,II,"threshing-floor, treading out the corn, so trampled the steeds of"
5434,II,"Achilles on corpses and shields and broken armour, as he passed on,"

5439,III,
5440,III,"The Trojan army was now split into two divisions, one of which was"
5441,III,"flying across the plain towards the city, while Achilles drove the"
5442,III,other before him towards the banks of Scamander.  Into the stream they
5443,III,"flocked, without pausing in their flight, like a cloud of locusts"
5444,III,driven by a fire to seek refuge in the nearest water; and Scamander's
5445,III,bed was choked by a huddled multitude of horses and men.
5446,III,
5447,III,"Leaning his spear against a plane-tree, Achilles leapt into the river,"
5448,III,"sword in hand, and struck right and left, until the waters were"

5450,III,"a dolphin, seeking the shallow waters near the shore, so shrank the"
5451,III,"Trojans from the sword of Achilles, and hid themselves under the"
5452,III,"arching banks.  Then he remembered his promise to Patroclus, and,"
5453,III,"choosing twelve comely youths from that panic-stricken throng, he drove"
5454,III,"them before him, and gave them, bound, to his men to be brought alive"
5455,III,"to the ships.  This done, he went back to continue the work of"
5456,III,"slaughter; and as he reached the river's brink he saw a Trojan, who had"
5457,III,"just left the water, and was preparing to fly towards the city.  ""Aha!"
5458,III,"are we met again?"" cried Achilles, recognising in the fugitive a"
5459,III,"certain Lycaon, one of the numerous family of Priam, whom once before"
5460,III,"he had taken prisoner, having caught him during a night foray, when the"
5461,III,"luckless youth was busy cutting the young shoots of the olive, to make"
5462,III,"a rim for a chariot.  On that occasion he had spared his life, and sold"
5463,III,"him into captivity to the King of Lemnos, from whom he had been"
5464,III,"ransomed by a friend of Priam, and so found his way back to Troy.  For"
5465,III,eleven days since his return from Lemnos he had taken his pleasure
5466,III,"among his friends, and on the twelfth his fate threw him into the hands"
5467,III,of Achilles for the second and last time.
5468,III,
5469,III,"Lycaon had flung away shield and helmet and spear, that he might be"
5470,III,lightened in the race for his life.  But Achilles was upon him before
5471,III,"he was aware, threatening him with uplifted spear.  ""So thou hast"
5472,III,"returned from Lemnos?"" he said mockingly.  ""We will now send thee on a"
5473,III,"longer journey, and we will see if thou come back again this time."""
5474,III,"The wretched youth flung himself down, and avoiding the spear-point"
5475,III,"crawled on his knees to Achilles, and clinging to him said: ""Have pity"
5476,III,"on me, great warrior, and have respect for the sacred tie between host"
5477,III,"and guest; for I was thy guest, illustrious chieftain, and have broken"
5478,III,"bread under thy roof, on the day when thou madest me captive.  Thou"
5479,III,"hast no cause to hate me, for I was not born of the same mother as"
5480,III,"Hector, who slew thy friend."""
5481,III,
5482,III,But there was no sign of relenting in the stern face which was bent
5483,III,"over him, and he received a foretaste of the pangs of death as he heard"
5484,III,"the answer of Achilles.  ""Talk not to me,"" said he, ""of ransom or"
5485,III,redemption.  As long as Patroclus was alive I was well pleased to make
5486,III,"prisoners and release them for a price, but now not one shall escape of"

5497,III,"waist, and seizing his body by the foot flung it into the river.  ""Lie"
5498,III,"there among the fishes!"" cried that ruthless man: ""They will tend thy"

5509,III,"brave Thracian chieftain, and the son of the presiding deity of Axius,"
5510,III,"a broad and noble stream.  This man now barred the way of Achilles,"
5511,III,"brandishing a spear in each hand.  ""Whence and what art thou?"" cried"

5514,III,"""Art thou weary of thy life?"" he asked again, as the Thracian still"
5515,III,"came on.  ""I will tell thee what I am,"" answered Asteropæus boldly: ""I"
5516,III,"am the son of a deity, even as thou art, and my father was Axius, the"
5517,III,"fairest river on earth.  Now let us fight, great son of Thetis."""

5519,III,"With that he flung both spears at once, for he was equally skilled with"
5520,III,both hands; and one of the spears struck against the shield of
5521,III,"Achilles, but could not penetrate it, while the other grazed his right"
5522,III,"arm, and drew blood.  Then Achilles hurled his spear, which missed"
5523,III,"Asteropæus, and buried itself to half its length in the river bank."
5524,III,"Asteropæus grasped the shaft, and strove with all his might to tear the"
5525,III,"weapon from the ground.  Failing in this, he next tried to break it in"
5526,III,"the middle, to use as a club; but by this time Achilles was upon him,"
5527,III,"and with one stroke of his sword clove him almost in twain.  ""Thou hast"
5528,III,"found thy match, thou river's brood!"" he cried, stripping off the"
5529,III,"bloodstained armour.  ""Fool, that comparest thyself with me, whose"
5530,III,"fathers sprang in a direct line from Jove!  He, methinks, is mightier"
5531,III,"than any river, yea, mightier than Oceanus, the great father of floods,"
5532,III,"who trembles before the red lightning, and the voice of the thunder,"
5533,III,"when it crashes through the skies."""
5534,III,
5535,III,"So saying he lightly plucked out the embedded spear, and went in"
5536,III,"pursuit of the men of Asteropæus, who were crouching in terror along"
5537,III,"the river's banks.  Seven of them he slew, and was about to continue"
5538,III,the work of carnage when he received a check.  From the depths of the
5539,III,"stream a mysterious voice arose, in tones of protest and complaint:"
5540,III,"""Achilles, thine arm is exceeding mighty, and thy prowess more than"
5541,III,mortal; for the gods are ever near to aid thee.  If Zeus hath given
5542,III,"thee leave to slaughter all the Trojans, at least drive them away from"
5543,III,my bed and butcher them on the plain.  My waters are choked with
5544,III,"corpses, and I cannot roll my current any longer towards the holy sea,"
5545,III,because my channel is straitened by the multitude of thy miserable
5546,III,"victims.  Give place, great chieftain, and cumber me no more."""
5547,III,
5548,III,"""It shall be as thou sayest, thou god revered,"" answered Achilles."
5549,III,"""But suffer me yet a little while until my task is done.""  And without"
5550,III,further parley he sprang down again into the river bed.  Then the god
5551,III,"was wroth, and prepared to expel that daring intruder from his domain."
5552,III,"He gathered all his waters, which rose up in surging billows, and"
5553,III,"washed the corpses ashore; and to the living he gave shelter, hiding"
5554,III,"them away in great hollow eddies.  Then, collecting himself in one"
5555,III,"towering wave, he rushed upon Achilles, buffeting his shield, and"
5556,III,"eating away the ground under his feet.  Achilles grasped an elm, a tall"
5557,III,"and stately tree, and clung to it for support; but the torrent had"
5558,III,"undermined its roots, and the next moment it fell, tearing a huge gap"
5559,III,"in the bank, and damming back the waters with its leafy boughs.  Then"
5560,III,"he leaped from the yellow, swirling torrent, and darted across the"
5561,III,plain in head-long flight; for he was sore afraid.  But Scamander
5562,III,"followed hard at his heels, roaring and arching his crest.  In vain"
5563,III,"Achilles ran and doubled, and doubled and ran; the river pursued him"
5564,III,"everywhere, until his strength began to fail him; and if he stood still"
5565,III,"for a moment the waves rose instantly as high as his shoulders,"
5566,III,"threatening to swallow him up.  Then he gave himself up for lost, and"
5567,III,"with a groan he gazed upward to the broad heaven, and uttered this"
5568,III,"despairing cry for help: ""O all ye gods, is this then to be my end?  Am"
5569,III,"I to perish thus, drowned like some nameless churl, who is swept away"
5570,III,"while crossing a ford in winter?"""
5571,III,
5572,III,"Some friendly power heard his wild appeal, and lent him new strength"
5573,III,and courage to continue the struggle.  So on he panted across the
5574,III,"plain, which by this time was covered with floating corpses, helmets,"
5575,III,and shields.  But Scamander raged the more furiously when he saw his
5576,III,"prey still eluding his clutch, and he called aloud to Simocis, his"
5577,III,"brother stream, to join in the pursuit.  And Simocis answered to his"
5578,III,"call, and mustered all his waters from every fountainhead and every"
5579,III,"tributary stream.  Then the twin rivers roared together in unison, and"
5580,III,"came down upon him, battering him with uprooted trees and rolling"
5581,III,"rocks, which they swept along in their course, ""We will quell thee,"""
5582,III,"they shouted, ""thou godless man, for all thy beauty and thy strength,"
5583,III,and thou and thy gleaming panoply shall be wrapped in a thick shroud of
5584,III,"mud, at the bottom of our blackest and deepest pool.  Thy dirge shall"
5585,III,"be sung by our rolling waters, and thy monument none shall behold."""
5586,III,
5587,III,"Achilles was now in extremity, and would surely have ended as ignobly"
5588,III,"as the river-god had said, if another power had not come to his aid."
5589,III,"""Where art thou, my son, Hephæstus?"" cried Hera, seeing that Achilles"
5590,III,"could hold out no longer.  ""Thou art he who should save our champion in"
5591,III,"this strait, for thou and Scamander are natural enemies.  Haste thee to"
5592,III,"the rescue, armed with thy proper element; and I will summon the blasts"
5593,III,of the West and the South to fan thy flames.  Let fire fight with
5594,III,"water, and spare not, nor cease thy fury until I give thee the signal"
5595,III,"to desist."""
5596,III,
5597,III,"Hephæstus made haste to obey his mother, and forthwith he caused a"
5598,III,"sheet of fire to sweep across the plain, burning the corpses, and"
5599,III,"drying up the flood.  Then he turned his flames upon the river himself,"
5600,III,"and all the trees which fringed his banks--elms, and willows, and"
5601,III,plane-trees--were soon ablaze.  Speedily the fire spread to the rushes
5602,III,"and water plants, and at last the very waters began to grow hot, so"
5603,III,"that the fishes leapt into the air in their agony, and Scamander"
5604,III,himself was in dire distress.
5605,III,
5606,III,"""It is enough,"" he cried, yielding to a superior power.  ""Torment me no"
5607,III,"more, Hephæstus!  Let Achilles destroy the whole nation of Trojans, if"
5608,III,"he will--I will not seek to prevent him."""
5609,III,
5610,III,"By this time the waters were beginning to boil and bubble, and clouds"
5611,III,of steam rose into the air.  Seeing that the river was thoroughly
5612,III,"quelled, Hera gave the signal, and Hephæstus drew off his forces, and"
5613,III,left Scamander in peace.

5620,IV,"rout, and a second slaughter, and Priam, who was watching the field"
5621,IV,"from his citadel, soon beheld the whole remnant of the Trojan army"
5622,IV,flying before Achilles towards the city.  With a cry of alarm he
5623,IV,"hastened down to the gates, and gave directions to the warders to draw"
5624,IV,"bolt and bar, and admit the flying multitude.  ""But stand ready,"" he"
5625,IV,"said, ""to make all fast, as soon as the people are safe within, for"

5633,IV,"Priam's fears might have been realised if Agenor, a young Trojan noble,"
5634,IV,"had not been inspired by Apollo with sudden courage, which prompted him"
5635,IV,"to cross the destroyer's path.  ""I will face this man,"" he said,"
5636,IV,"halting from his flight.  ""He too is of mortal flesh, and has but one"
5637,IV,"life to lose.  I will face him, though Zeus fight on his side."""

5639,IV,"As a leopard comes forth from his thick covert to meet the hunter, when"
5640,IV,"he hears the baying of the hounds, and, even though sorely wounded,"
5641,IV,"fights on till he is slain, so stood Agenor to meet Achilles, with"
5642,IV,"shield on breast, and spear poised for the throw.  ""Thou thoughtest to"
5643,IV,"have taken Troy this day,"" he cried.  ""Thou fool!  This deed is not for"
5644,IV,"thee; thou shall not read to the end the story of her woes, but here,"
5645,IV,"on this spot, I will end thy life of blood."""
5646,IV,
5647,IV,"With that he cast his spear, which struck him on the greave above the"
5648,IV,"knee, but rebounded from the tempered metal; but before Achilles could"
5649,IV,"return the attack Apollo removed Agenor from his reach, and putting on"
5650,IV,"the likeness of Agenor fled away towards the river, luring Achilles"
5651,IV,"after him.  The Trojans were thus given time to make good their escape,"
5652,IV,"and the city was soon filled with a frightened and disordered host,"
5653,IV,thankful to have escaped with bare life.  All along the battlements
5654,IV,"were seen groups of exhausted men, who wiped the sweat from their"
5655,IV,"brows, and drank deep draughts of wine to quench their burning thirst."
5656,IV,"Only one was left outside: This was Hector, who remained of his own"

5675,I,"mine honour had I but the power.""  Then, like a fiery courser starting"

5678,I,"heat of summer, the season of drought and fever, such was the bright"

5684,I,"stretching out his hands over the battlements, thus spake unto Hector,"
5685,I,"beseeching him earnestly, and with tears: ""O Hector, my son, my son,"
5686,I,"remain not there, thus deserted and alone, to abide the coming of that"
5687,I,"fearful man, seeing that he is mightier far than thou.  He hath robbed"
5688,I,"me of many a noble son, whom he hath killed or sold into captivity in"

5690,I,"life away, to bring glory on Pelides, and on us sorrow and loss"
5691,I,"unspeakable.  Alas! will it never cease, the storm of misery which"
5692,I,"rains without pause on this white, distracted head!  No, I see them"
5693,I,"flocking, the spectres of worse evils yet to come, sorrow on sorrow,"
5694,I,"and woe on woe--murdered sons and daughters dragged into bondage, a"
5695,I,"violated home, and little children dashed to the ground in the fury of"
5696,I,battle.  Last scene of all--an old man slaughtered on his own

5709,I,rejected with scorn the prudent advice which Polydamas had given the
5710,I,"night before, and had thereby caused the death of a legion of Trojans."
5711,I,How could he face the taunts of the women whom his rashness had made
5712,I,"widows, and the mute reproaches of the children now orphaned by his"

5714,I,"challenge.  A wild plan crossed his mind, only to be instantly"
5715,I,"rejected: should he lay aside shield, and helmet, and spear, and go"
5716,I,"unarmed to Achilles, offering to make an end of this lamentable war at"
5717,I,"the cost of half the city's goods, and the free restitution of Helen"
5718,I,"with all her wealth?  ""No,"" he said, convinced at once of the desperate"

5721,I,"This is no time for gentle parley, as between maid and youth sitting in"

5724,I,
5725,I,"Achilles was now close at hand, with the mighty Pelian ash swaying on"
5726,I,"his right shoulder, and his armour blazing like the light of the rising"
5727,I,"sun.  When Hector saw him advancing, like an incarnate spirit of"
5728,I,"vengeance, all his heroic resolves forsook him, and seized with sudden"
5729,I,"terror he turned and fled.  And as a falcon swoops down on a hare, and"
5730,I,"pounces, and pounces again, as his victim leaps and doubles, to escape"
5731,I,"from the fatal clutch, so Achilles darted after Hector, following all"
5732,I,"the turns and windings of his flight.  Past a low hill they went,"
5733,I,whence the Trojan scout had espied the advance of the Greeks not many
5734,I,"days before, and past the wild fig-tree, following a beaten road, which"
5735,I,"led to two fair springs, the double source of eddying Scamander.  One"
5736,I,"of the springs is of hot water, and a cloud of steam hangs over it,"
5737,I,like the smoke of a burning fire; but the other is cold as ice.  Here
5738,I,"were broad washing-pits, lined with stone, in which the wives and"
5739,I,"daughters were wont to tread the clothes, in the old peaceful days,"
5740,I,before ever the Greeks had landed on the shores of Troy.  Leaving these
5741,I,"behind them, they sped on, and still on, pursuer and pursued.  Noble"
5742,I,"was the quarry, but the hunter was nobler far, and never before had he"
5743,I,"run in so keen a chase.  Like mettled steeds, which strive for the"
5744,I,"mastery, where the prize is a vessel of gold or of silver, they flew;"
5745,I,"but here they were running for a far higher stake, even the very life"
5746,I,of Troy's bravest son.
5747,I,
5748,I,"Three times they compassed the whole circuit of the walls, and again"
5749,I,and again Hector tried to draw his pursuer within range of the spears
5750,I,of the Trojans who lined the battlements; but each time his effort was
5751,I,"defeated by Achilles, who barred his way to the city, and drove him"
5752,I,back into the open plain.
5753,I,
5754,I,"As one who pursues his enemy in a dream, and cannot catch him, though"
5755,I,"he seems ever within reach, so was Achilles ever baffled, when he"
5756,I,"strove to overtake Hector, and Hector, when he strove to escape.  All"
5757,I,"the Greeks stood near in their ranks, watching the chase--and many a"
5758,I,"time a spear was levelled at Hector, to strike him down; but Achilles"
5759,I,"beckoned with his hand, and forbade his comrades to come between him"
5760,I,and his victim.

5762,I,"For the fourth time they came to the place of the washing-pits, and"

5765,I,"panting, and leaning on his spear, Athene drew near to him, unseen of"

5774,I,"brother, standing by his side, and heard the familiar tones of his"
5775,I,"voice.  ""Dear brother,"" said Deiphobus, ""thou art hard beset, and"

5787,I,"the fortune of war.  Go thou first, and I will follow."""
5788,I,
5789,I,"Hector accordingly advanced to meet Achilles, who was already moving"
5790,I,"towards him.  ""I will fly thee no more,"" he said, when they were within"
5791,I,"a spear's cast of each other, ""I will either slay thee, or be slain."
5792,I,"But let us first make a covenant, and call the gods to witness it:"
5793,I,"swear thou that, if I fall, thou wilt restore my body and my armour to"
5794,I,"the Trojans--and I will swear to do the like by thee."""
5795,I,
5796,I,"""Talk not to me of covenants, thou villain!"" answered Achilles"
5797,I,"fiercely.  ""As there is no treaty possible between lions and men, no"
5798,I,"concord between wolves and lambs, but only fear and hatred, so is there"
5799,I,"hate unending between me and thee, which naught but death may cancel or"
5800,I,"abate.  Summon up all thy manhood, and prepare to pay the price of my"
5801,I,"comrades whom thou hast slain."""
5802,I,
5803,I,"This said he poised and flung his spear; but Hector stooped low, and"
5804,I,"the spear flew over his head, and sank deep into the earth.  Unobserved"
5805,I,"by Hector, Athene drew it out, and gave it back to Achilles.  ""Take now"
5806,I,"my spear!"" shouted the Trojan, ""take it to thy heart, thou braggart,"
5807,I,"that thinkest to dismay me with boastful words!""  The weapon flew"
5808,I,"straight to its mark, and, striking the centre of Achilles' shield,"
5809,I,"rebounded to a distance, and fell rattling on the ground.  Then Hector"
5810,I,"called anxiously to Deiphobus, bidding him bring another lance.  But no"
5811,I,"answer came, for the real Deiphobus was safe behind the walls, and he"
5812,I,"who had appeared to Hector was a false Deiphobus, concealing the person"
5813,I,of Athene.
5814,I,
5815,I,"""Alas!  I have been deceived,"" said Hector.  ""My last bolt is shot, and"

5819,I,
5820,I,"Then, drawing his sword, he rushed upon Achilles, who came on slowly,"
5821,I,"towering above the rampart of his shield, nodding his golden plumes and"
5822,I,"brandishing high his spear, whose point twinkled and flashed like the"
5823,I,"light of the evening star.  Scanning every joint in Hector's armour, at"
5824,I,"last Achilles spied a point, between the shoulder-blade and the neck,"
5825,I,which was undefended; and at this mark he hurled his spear with all his
5826,I,force and pierced him through the neck.  But the passage of his voice

5853,I,
5854,I,"Then he drew out his spear, and laying it aside, began to strip off the"

5861,I,"When Achilles had finished stripping the corpse, he stood up and spoke"
5862,I,"thus to the assembled host: ""Princes and counsellors of the Greeks, now"
5863,I,"that the gods have granted us to slay this mighty champion, who hath"
5864,I,"done us more harm than all the rest together, shall we not advance in"
5865,I,"full force against the city, and end the war at one bold stroke?  But"
5866,I,alas! what am I saying?  We have another and a sadder duty to perform.
5867,I,"Patroclus lies among the ships, unburied, unwept, and shall I forget"
5868,I,"him in this hour of triumph?  No; not in the hour of death, not in the"
5869,I,"grave itself, which brings, they say, oblivion to all, shall my love"
5870,I,"for him grow cold.  Therefore follow me, sirs, to the ships, and raise"
5871,I,"the song of victory.  We have gained great glory, we have slain Troy's"
5872,I,"chief defender, to whom all the Trojans prayed as to a god."""
5873,I,
5874,I,"Then, in fulfilment of his horrible menaces, he prepared to take"
5875,I,hideous vengeance on his slaughtered enemy.  Stooping down he pierced
5876,I,"the dead man's feet from heel to ankle, and passed a leathern thong"
5877,I,"through the holes; then he made fast the thong behind the chariot, and,"
5878,I,"taking up the armour, he sprang into the driver's place, and lashed his"
5879,I,horses to a gallop.  So amid a swirling cloud of dust the fallen hero
5880,I,"was dragged along, with his dark locks streaming, and that comely head"
5881,I,marred and defiled; and Zeus delivered him to injury and outrage at the
5882,I,hands of his enemies in his own native land.
5883,I,
5884,I,
5885,II,II
5886,II,
5887,II,But what were the feelings of the Trojans watching on the walls when
5888,II,"they saw their great champion fall, and with what eyes did the aged"
5889,II,"king and the fond mother behold their Hector, their joy and pride, and"
5890,II,"chief defence, butchered, mutilated, and dragged through the dust!"
5891,II,"Through all the city arose a great cry of lamentation, and such horror"
5892,II,"was written on every face as if the Greeks had carried Troy by storm,"
5893,II,and were filling her streets with fire and slaughter.  Priam was hardly
5894,II,"restrained from going forth at once, with the purpose of entering the"
5895,II,"Grecian camp, and throwing himself at the feet of Achilles."
5896,II,
5897,II,"But there was another, bound by an even nearer and dearer tie to the"
5898,II,"slain, who was the last to learn the fearful news.  This was"
5899,II,"Andromache, Hector's wife, who was sitting at her loom in the"
5900,II,"retirement of her chamber, weaving a piece of flowered tapestry."
5901,II,"Presently she left her task, and calling her handmaids bade them"
5902,II,prepare the bath for their master against his return from battle.  Her
5903,II,"face was cheerful and serene, and she smiled as she thought of the"
5904,II,happy meeting which seemed so near.  But in the midst of these pleasant
5905,II,"household cares a dreadful sound reached her ears--a shrill note, as of"
5906,II,"women shrieking, mingled with the deeper groans of men.  ""Hark!"" she"
5907,II,"said, turning deadly pale, and dropping the shuttle, which she had been"
5908,II,"holding in her hand: ""What mean these cries?""  Then, as she paused"
5909,II,"again to listen, she heard the voice of Hecuba, raised in loud anguish"
5910,II,above the rest.  With a woman's quick instinct she divined that the
5911,II,"worst had befallen her, and shrieking: ""Hector, my Hector, is slain!"""
5912,II,"she hastened, with ashy cheeks, and tottering knees, to the walls.  The"
5913,II,"crowd fell back at her approach, and every voice was hushed when they"
5914,II,"saw her bending over the battlements, and gazing with wild eyes across"
5915,II,"the plain.  Then she saw Achilles in full career towards the ships,"
5916,II,dragging her husband's body behind his car.  At that sight she gave one
5917,II,"gasping cry, and reeling back fell swooning into the arms of her"
5918,II,"kinswomen who were standing ready to aid.  Thus for awhile she lay,"
5919,II,"motionless and lifeless, with her long hair, escaped from its bands,"
5920,II,"streaming about her.  At last she drew a deep, sobbing breath, and"
5921,II,opening her eyes looked into the anxious faces bent over her.  Then the
5922,II,"full consciousness of her loss rushed back upon her in a bitter flood,"
5923,II,and breaking from the gentle hands which held her she made as if she
5924,II,would fling herself down from the battlements.  She was prevented by
5925,II,"kindly force, and led away, moaning and weeping, to her widowed home."

5936,I,
5937,I,"When Achilles reached the camp, he commanded his men to remain under"
5938,I,"arms, and led the whole company, with horses and with chariots, in"
5939,I,"solemn procession, three times round the couch on which the dead"
5940,I,"Patroclus lay.  When the strange rite was ended, the couch, which had"
5941,I,"been brought out for this purpose, was carried back with its burden to"
5942,I,"the tent, and they unyoked their horses, and prepared to take their"
5943,I,"supper.  Hector's body was flung into a corner, where it lay exposed to"
5944,I,"the burning sun, and the cold dews of night.  Achilles feasted his men"
5945,I,"bountifully, and then went, attended by a special guard of honour, to"
5946,I,partake of a banquet in the royal tent.  Being invited to refresh
5947,I,"himself with a bath, he stubbornly refused, and swore a great oath that"
5948,I,he would never wash the stains of battle from his person until
5949,I,Patroclus had been buried with all the pomp of woe.  At the banquet he
5950,I,"seemed ill at ease, and as soon as it was ended he prayed his kingly"
5951,I,"host to have him excused, and went back to the quarters of the"
5952,I,Myrmidons.
5953,I,
5954,I,"Night came down, and silence fell on the sleeping camp.  Achilles had"
5955,I,"not sought his bed, but had laid himself down on the sand, in a clear"
5956,I,"space, where the billows broke at his feet.  There sleep soon overtook"
5957,I,"him, stilling the dull ache of sorrow; for his limbs were very weary,"
5958,I,"after that tremendous fight, and still more tremendous race.  And as he"
5959,I,"slept the ghost of Patroclus came and stood by his side, like to the"
5960,I,"living man in stature and in face and in voice, and in the very"
5961,I,"garments he had on; and thus spake the spectre, in hollow and mournful"
5962,I,"tones: ""Ah! fickle heart, oblivious of the dead, canst thou sleep,"
5963,I,Achilles?  Has death broken the bond which united us in life?  Bury me
5964,I,"with all speed, and let me wander no more, a homeless ghost, at the"
5965,I,"gates of Hades, disowned and rejected by the other spirits who have"
5966,I,"crossed the dark river.  Give me thy hand, sweet friend, I entreat"
5967,I,"thee!  For never again shall I return to earth, when ye have given my"
5968,I,"body to the flames--never more shall we sit retired from our comrades,"
5969,I,"as once in life, and take sweet counsel together.  My fate hath seized"
5970,I,"me, and cast me down into the pit which was prepared for me when I was"
5971,I,"born; and for thee too the bolt is prepared, which shall lay thee low"
5972,I,beneath the walls of Troy.  And one more charge have I to lay upon
5973,I,"thee: let not our bones lie apart, Achilles, but let us be joined in"
5974,I,"death, even as we were united in life.  One home, one love, we shared,"
5975,I,"and thy father was to me as mine own, from the day when I slew my"
5976,I,"playmate in a childish brawl, and was brought by Men[oe]tius to the"
5977,I,"house of Peleus.  Therefore, when thy fate hath reached thee, let our"
5978,I,"ashes be mingled in one urn."""
5979,I,
5980,I,"""Wherefore, beloved,"" answered Achilles in his sleep, ""hast thou come"
5981,I,"hither to remind me of my duty, and seemest to doubt my love?  Come"
5982,I,"nearer, that I may embrace thee!  Yet a little while let my heart beat"
5983,I,"against thine, and ease its heavy burden of sorrow."""
5984,I,
5985,I,With these words he stretched out his eager arms to clasp Patroclus to
5986,I,"his breast; but the ghost eluded his grasp, and with one piercing wail"
5987,I,"melted away like smoke into the darkness.  ""Alas!"" cried Achilles,"
5988,I,"springing up in amaze, and summoning his comrades, ""I perceive that,"
5989,I,"even in the house of Hades, there is a spirit and a phantom of the"
5990,I,dead--but understanding none at all--for all night long the ghost of
5991,I,"the hapless Patroclus stood by my side moaning and lamenting, and"
5992,I,straitly charging me concerning all that I must do.  And the phantom
5993,I,"was in aspect as the living man himself."""
5994,I,
5995,I,
5996,II,II
5997,II,
5998,II,At earliest dawn a long train of mules was seen ascending the lower
5999,II,"slopes of Ida, attended by a numerous company of men, all carrying axes"
6000,II,and ropes of withes.  The whole troop was under the command of
6001,II,"Meriones, the squire of Idomeneus, on whom the task had been laid of"
6002,II,providing fuel for the funeral pyre of Patroclus.  A large grove of
6003,II,"pines was felled, the trunks were divided into logs, and these were"
6004,II,bound into bundles and laid on the backs of the mules.  Then down the
6005,II,"slope they were driven at a quick trot, the men running beside them;"
6006,II,and when they reached the camp the mules were unloaded and the logs
6007,II,piled up in an open space pointed out by Achilles.  A thousand willing
6008,II,"hands aided in the work, and soon a huge stack of pinewood towered in"
6009,II,the midst of the ships and tents.
6010,II,
6011,II,"When the pyre was raised, Achilles gave the order to the Myrmidons to"
6012,II,gird on their armour and harness the steeds to their cars.  The whole
6013,II,"army stood waiting, drawn up in silence on either side of the way by"
6014,II,which the funeral train was to pass; and presently the procession was
6015,II,"seen approaching.  First came the chariots, each carrying two men--the"
6016,II,"driver, and the man-at-arms; behind these followed a numerous troop of"
6017,II,"infantry, marching slowly in dense array; and in the space between the"
6018,II,"corpse was borne, covered with locks of hair which the Myrmidons had"
6019,II,cut off as a last tribute to the dead.
6020,II,
6021,II,"Achilles walked behind the bier, supporting the head of Patroclus in"
6022,II,"his hands, and moving heavily, as one that mourns for a brother; and so"
6023,II,"they passed on, through the long lane of mailed warriors, until they"
6024,II,came to the place where the pyre was built.
6025,II,
6026,II,"Then Achilles took a sharp knife, and cut off from his forehead a long"
6027,II,"lock of hair, and, placing the lock in the dead man's hand, turned"
6028,II,round and gazed wistfully across the dark gulf of waters which divided
6029,II,"him from his home.  ""Alas for the hopes of men!"" he said, in a voice of"
6030,II,"distress.  ""My father Peleus designed this lock for another purpose, as"
6031,II,"an offering to thee, Spercheus, my native stream, if ever I returned"
6032,II,"safe from the war.  But now thine altar, which stands in thy grove near"
6033,II,"thy sacred source, shall never smoke for me again.  A foreign grave"
6034,II,"awaits me, far from my home and kindred, and Peleus is absolved from"
6035,II,"his vow.  Therefore to thee, Patroclus, I dedicate this lock."""
6036,II,
6037,II,The Greeks now dispersed to their quarters leaving those who were
6038,II,"nearest to the dead, by birth or by station, to perform the last rites."
6039,II,"The chief mourners approached the bier, and lifting it with the corpse"
6040,II,placed it on the top of the pyre.  Many sheep and oxen were slaughtered
6041,II,"and flayed, and the body of Patroclus was wrapped from head to foot in"
6042,II,the fat taken from the carcasses.  Then the carcasses of the victims
6043,II,"were heaped up round the bier, with jars of honey and olive-oil.  Four"
6044,II,"horses were next slaughtered, and two favourite hounds of Patroclus,"
6045,II,and their bodies added to the rest.  Last of all the twelve Trojan
6046,II,captives whom he had taken in battle the day before were led in chains
6047,II,"to the spot, butchered by Achilles with his own hands, and flung upon"
6048,II,the pyre.
6049,II,
6050,II,"""It is done!"" cried Achilles, when this last savage tribute was paid to"
6051,II,"his friend, ""I have accomplished my vow, and the fire may now do its"
6052,II,"work--but for thee, Hector, no fire shall be lighted, but dogs shall"
6053,II,"devour thee."""
6054,II,
6055,II,That cruel threat at least was not to be fulfilled.  Unseen hands were
6056,II,"busy about the fallen Trojan hero, guarding him day and night from the"
6057,II,prowling dogs of the camp.  Aphrodite embalmed his body with a heavenly
6058,II,"essence, which closed all his wounds, and kept his flesh pure and"
6059,II,unharmed; and Apollo covered all the place where he lay with a dark
6060,II,"cloud, to shield him from the scorching rays of the sun."
6061,II,
6062,II,Meanwhile torches had been brought to kindle the pyre.  But the huge
6063,II,"mass smouldered sullenly, and the victims remained unconsumed.  Then"
6064,II,"Achilles took a golden bowl, and pouring a libation to Boreas and"
6065,II,"Zephyrus, the twin gods of the winds, prayed them to lend their blasts"
6066,II,"and blow the fire to a blaze.  Iris heard his prayer, and went swiftly"
6067,II,to call the winds to his aid.  She found them seated at table with all
6068,II,their brethren in the house of Zephyrus; and thus spake Iris to that
6069,II,"boisterous company: ""Why sit ye here feasting and making merry, when"
6070,II,"there is work for you to do?  Hear ye not the prayers of Achilles, who"
6071,II,"needs your help, that the pyre of Patroclus may burn freely, and"
6072,II,"consume him to ashes, with all that lies about him."""
6073,II,
6074,II,"Prompt at the summons, the winds arose, with clamour and uproarious"
6075,II,"din, and rushed down the mountainside, chasing the clouds before them."
6076,II,"Over the complaining sea they swept, and flew whistling onward till"
6077,II,they reached the shores of Troy.  There they fell upon the smouldering
6078,II,"pyre, and the flames leaped and bellowed in response to the roaring"
6079,II,"blast.  So all night long they lashed the fire to fury, and all night"
6080,II,"long Achilles paced to and fro before the pyre, pouring libations from"
6081,II,"a golden bowl on the ground, and calling aloud to the ghost of his"
6082,II,ill-starred friend.  As mourns a father when he burns the bones of his
6083,II,"son, a young bridegroom cut off by death on his wedding-day, so mourned"
6084,II,Achilles as the fire devoured his comrade's body--so pitiful were his
6085,II,"cries, so faltering his gait."
6086,II,
6087,II,"Towards dawn the fire began to die out, and nothing was left but a vast"
6088,II,"heap of glowing ashes.  Then the winds went back to their home, and"
6089,II,"earth and ocean sank to rest, beneath the gentle light of the morning"
6090,II,"star.  Soothed by the calm influence of the hour, Achilles fell into a"
6091,II,"fitful slumber, but was soon aroused by the sound of footsteps and the"
6092,II,"murmur of voices.  Starting up, he saw a goodly company of nobles"
6093,II,"approaching, with Agamemnon at their head; and with their assistance"
6094,II,"the ritual ceremonies due to the dead were completed.  First, they"
6095,II,"poured wine on the glowing mass of embers, till the last spark was"
6096,II,"extinguished; then they collected the ashes of Patroclus, which lay by"
6097,II,"themselves, surrounded by the charred remains of beasts and men.  A"
6098,II,costly urn of gold received the few handfuls of dust which were all
6099,II,that remained of him whom they had so cherished and honoured; and the
6100,II,"urn was buried in a low mound of earth, which was one day to be raised"
6101,II,"to a commanding height, as a monument to the great Achilles."

6104,III,III
6105,III,
6106,III,"When the last tribute of sorrow had been paid, the rest of the day was"
6107,III,devoted to sport and festivity.  In heroic times funeral games were an
6108,III,important part of the honours assigned to a fallen warrior; and those
6109,III,of Patroclus were celebrated on a scale of unrivalled magnificence.
6110,III,
6111,III,"The great event of the day was to be the chariot race, and splendid"
6112,III,"prizes were offered by Achilles, who was the sole patron and prize"
6113,III,"giver, for the winners.  When the gifts were set in order, Achilles"
6114,III,rose and invited all who prided themselves in their horsemanship to
6115,III,"take part in the friendly contest.  ""If,"" he said, ""we were keeping"
6116,III,"this festival in honour of any other Greek, I myself must needs carry"
6117,III,"off the first prize; for no steeds in all the army can vie with mine,"
6118,III,the immortal coursers which were a gift from Poseidon to my father.
6119,III,But this is a day of mourning both to me and to them; for they have
6120,III,"lost their gentle charioteer, and now stand, sorrow-stricken, with"
6121,III,"manes drooping to the ground, in their stalls, deprived of his loving"
6122,III,"care.  Therefore take your places, all ye who would prove the mettle of"
6123,III,"your horses, and your own mastery of this gallant game."""
6124,III,
6125,III,Four chieftains brought their cars to try their fortune in the race:
6126,III,"Eumelus, a prince of Thessaly, a land renowned for its breed of horses;"
6127,III,"Diomede, who drove the horses which he had taken from Æneas; Menelaus,"
6128,III,"with a mare of Agamemnon's, named Arthe, and his own horse Podargus;"
6129,III,"and Antilochus, whose car was drawn by a pair from his father's"
6130,III,"stables.  Nestor, who knew their quality, which was indeed but poor,"
6131,III,"accompanied his son to the starting-point, and as they were the first"
6132,III,to arrive he improved the occasion by proffering a world of good
6133,III,"advice, reinforced by many a pithy saw, showing Antilochus how the want"
6134,III,"of speed may be remedied by cunning and skill.  ""Art,"" he said, ""is far"
6135,III,"greater than force.  Art drives the axe, though aimed by a weaker arm,"
6136,III,"deep into the heart of the oak; art controls the motions of tall ships,"
6137,III,by means of a very small helm; and art may save thee from reaching the
6138,III,"goal last in this race."""
6139,III,
6140,III,In the ancient chariot races the starting-point and the winning-post
6141,III,"were always the same, as it was the custom to run a certain distance,"
6142,III,"and then wheel round a certain point, and return on the homeward track,"
6143,III,which was parallel to the other.  The turning-point was marked by a
6144,III,"pillar, or some other conspicuous object, and here a desperate struggle"
6145,III,"often took place between the rival cars for the inside place, taxing"
6146,III,the skill and courage of the drivers to the utmost.  Nestor had been
6147,III,"over the course, and gave his son minute directions as to the"
6148,III,"appearance and position of the turning-post, which was far off on the"
6149,III,"plain, and invisible from the starting-point.  ""You will see,"" he said,"
6150,III,"""a withered stump of oak or fir, rising to about a fathom above the"
6151,III,"earth, with a white stone leaning against it on either side.  There you"
6152,III,must turn; and see that you lose no ground in wheeling round to the
6153,III,"homeward track.  Give your right horse the reins, and urge him to full"
6154,III,"speed with voice and lash, but rein in the other, and hold him back;"
6155,III,and let the nave of your left wheel just seem to graze the stump.  If
6156,III,"you can pass another car in turning, there is no fear that he will"
6157,III,"catch you again.  Thou hast my counsel: go, and prosper--be wary, and"
6158,III,"be wise."""
6159,III,
6160,III,"At the last moment a fifth chariot appeared on the scene, driven by"
6161,III,"Meriones.  Lots were cast for the stations, and Antilochus was so"
6162,III,"fortunate as to obtain the inside place.  The cars drew up in a line,"
6163,III,"Achilles gave the word, and away they went in a cloud of dust, the"
6164,III,"horses' manes streaming, the drivers shouting, and the cars gliding"
6165,III,"smoothly, or leaping and plunging at the uneven places."
6166,III,
6167,III,"Soon the cars began to separate by wider and wider intervals, and a"
6168,III,"keen struggle ensued between the Thracian horses, driven by Eumelus,"
6169,III,"and the Trojans, driven by Diomede.  Eumelus took the lead, but Diomede"
6170,III,followed him so close that he felt the hot breath of the pursuing
6171,III,horses on his back.  So they ran for about a bowshot; then Diomede
6172,III,"dropped his whip, and his horses, wanting the lash, began to fall back."
6173,III,"This accident befell him by the malice of Apollo, who owed him a grudge"
6174,III,for the havoc which he had wrought among the Trojans.  But Athene had
6175,III,"not forgotten her favourite, and she contrived that he should recover"
6176,III,"his whip, and put fresh mettle into his steeds.  Nor did she stop"
6177,III,"there, but, overtaking the car of Eumelus, she broke the yoke which"
6178,III,"coupled his horses, so that they reared violently in opposite"
6179,III,"directions, and the pole of the car was dashed to the ground.  Thus"
6180,III,"suddenly arrested at the height of his speed, Eumelus rolled headlong"
6181,III,"from the car, and sustained woeful damage.  The skin was torn from his"
6182,III,"elbows and nose and mouth, his forehead was severely bruised, and he"
6183,III,lay for a while senseless where he fell.  This mishap secured an easy
6184,III,"victory for Diomede.  Avoiding the wreck, he pressed onwards, leaving"
6185,III,"the whole field far behind, turned the goal successfully, and drove at"
6186,III,an easy gallop along the homeward track.
6187,III,
6188,III,"He was followed at a long distance by Menelaus, now second in the race;"
6189,III,"and the third place was held by Antilochus, whose ambition had been"
6190,III,"fired by the unlooked-for good fortune of Diomede, so that he hoped by"
6191,III,some similar accident to obtain at least the second prize.  Cheering on
6192,III,"his horses, he went hard in pursuit of Menelaus, who was just then"
6193,III,"approaching a difficult piece of ground, where the course had been"
6194,III,hollowed out by the winter rains.  The place was too narrow to allow
6195,III,"two cars to pass, and Antilochus determined to secure the lead before"
6196,III,Menelaus had time to reach the broad course on the other side of the
6197,III,"ravine.  Accordingly he plied the lash unsparingly, and overtook"
6198,III,Menelaus at the moment when he was about to enter the neck of the dry
6199,III,"watercourse.  ""Keep back!"" shouted Menelaus in alarm.  ""Do not try to"
6200,III,"pass me here, or you will wreck both our cars."""

6202,III,"Antilochus pretended not to hear, and drove on harder than ever, so"
6203,III,"that Menelaus, who was a timid driver, was compelled to rein in his"
6204,III,horses and let him go by.
6205,III,
6206,III,"While the race was being thus run, with varying turns of fortune, the"
6207,III,"chieftains assembled round Achilles were sitting in their places,"
6208,III,"waiting for the return of the cars, and discussing the chances of the"
6209,III,"drivers.  Presently Idomeneus, who sat somewhat apart from the rest, in"
6210,III,"a position which gave him a long view over the course, cried out"
6211,III,"excitedly: ""Diomede is leading!  I can see the white mark on the face"
6212,III,"of one of the horses, which shows that he is one of the Trojan"
6213,III,"stallions--the red chestnut, with a mark like a half-moon on his"
6214,III,"forehead.  Look out, some of you who have younger eyes than mine, and"
6215,III,"see if I am right."""
6216,III,
6217,III,"""Hold thy peace, old prater!"" said Ajax, son of Oileus, roughly.  ""We"
6218,III,can see nothing yet--neither canst thou.  Eumelus was leading when we
6219,III,"saw him last, and doubtless he is leading still."""
6220,III,
6221,III,"""Thou mannerless fellow!"" answered Idomeneus hotly.  ""Foremost in a"
6222,III,"brawl, and in all else the least of the Greeks!  Come, let us lay a"
6223,III,"wager, and Agamemnon shall hold the stakes; or art thou afraid to back"
6224,III,"thy saucy tongue?"""
6225,III,
6226,III,"Ajax started up in a rage, hurling abuse at the Cretan veteran, and"
6227,III,"words would have soon led to blows, had not Achilles interposed his"
6228,III,"authority to put an end to the quarrel.  ""For shame!"" he said, rising"
6229,III,"from his seat, ""I wonder to hear you, two men of name and high station,"
6230,III,wrangling like boors.  What avails this idle contention?  Wait but a
6231,III,"moment, and the winner will be here to answer for himself."""
6232,III,
6233,III,"Even as he spoke, a loud huzza was heard, and a moment after, the"
6234,III,"Trojan car, driven by Diomede, turned the last corner, and came racing"
6235,III,"lightly down the last straight stretch of the course, until it was"
6236,III,pulled up before the chair of Achilles.  Sthenelus was standing ready
6237,III,"to welcome his comrade, and the first prize--a female slave, and a huge"
6238,III,cauldron for heating water for the bath--was forthwith delivered to the
6239,III,victor.
6240,III,
6241,III,"After a long interval Antilochus came in, driving at a heavy gallop,"
6242,III,"and hotly pursued by Menelaus, who was gaining at every stride, and had"
6243,III,by this time reduced the wide gap which had separated them to a mere
6244,III,"hand's-breadth.  His horses were displaying splendid mettle, especially"
6245,III,"the mare Arthe, who had been given to Agamemnon by a wealthy noble of"
6246,III,"Sicyon, as the price of his exemption from serving in the war; and if"
6247,III,"the course had been a bowshot longer he would have passed Antilochus,"
6248,III,"and taken the second prize.  As it was, he came in third, but those who"
6249,III,stood near as he was dismounting could see that he was red with
6250,III,"indignation, and big with some grievance, real or supposed."
6251,III,
6252,III,"The fourth was Meriones, who was a poor driver, and whose steeds were"
6253,III,"the weakest; and last of all came Eumelus, with face sorely disfigured,"
6254,III,"dragging his wrecked car behind him, and driving before him his horses."
6255,III,"""The last man is the best!"" cried Achilles, moved to pity by his"
6256,III,"ill-fortune.  ""How say you, sirs?  Shall we not give him the second"
6257,III,"prize?""  The proposal found general approval, excepting, of course,"
6258,III,"with Antilochus, who loudly protested against such an award.  ""Thou art"
6259,III,"no friend of mine, Achilles,"" he said angrily, ""if thou deprive me of"
6260,III,the gift which I have fairly earned.  Prizes are given to reward the
6261,III,"winners, not to console the unlucky.  If you wish to be generous, you"
6262,III,"can make Eumelus happy by bestowing on him some other gift, of equal or"
6263,III,"greater value, out of the rich store which is laid up in your tent."
6264,III,"But this prize is mine, and I will not give her up no, not if I have to"
6265,III,"fight for her."""
6266,III,
6267,III,"So saying, he seized the halter of the mare, who was tethered near,"
6268,III,"with her foal, to be given to him who won the second place."
6269,III,
6270,III,The great Achilles smiled indulgently at the defiant attitude of
6271,III,"Antilochus, who was very dear to him.  ""It shall be as you say,"" he"
6272,III,"replied.  ""The prize is yours, and to Eumelus I will give the corslet"
6273,III,"of Asteropæus, which I won in the battle yesterday.""  Automedon brought"
6274,III,"the corslet--a curious piece of work, finely fashioned in brass, with a"
6275,III,casting of white metal--and Eumelus' eyes glistened with pleasure as he
6276,III,received it.
6277,III,
6278,III,But the storm which had been lowering in the face of Menelaus ever
6279,III,since Antilochus had passed him now burst.  Having caused the herald to
6280,III,"proclaim silence he took the staff from his hands, as a sign that he"
6281,III,"had an important statement to make, and standing up before the whole"
6282,III,"assembly proclaimed his wrongs to the ears of all.  ""I am astonished,"""
6283,III,"he said, ""at the conduct of Antilochus.  He has beaten me in the race"
6284,III,"by a trick, though his horses are far inferior to mine in any fair"
6285,III,trial of speed.  I appeal to all those present to say whether it is not
6286,III,"so.  If he denies it, let him take his whip in his hand, and holding"
6287,III,"his horses by the rein swear a solemn oath, in the name of Poseidon,"
6288,III,"the god of horsemanship, that he did not hinder me by fraud in the"
6289,III,"race."""
6290,III,
6291,III,"Menelaus was clearly in the wrong, indeed, his whole plea was absurd;"
6292,III,for nothing but his own faint-heartedness had lost him the second
6293,III,prize.  But out of respect to his high rank and amiable character
6294,III,Antilochus was willing to appease him.  Accordingly he brought the mare
6295,III,"with her foal to Menelaus, and placing the bridle in his hand said"
6296,III,"respectfully: ""Spare me thy reproaches, gentle prince!  I yield to thee"
6297,III,"the prize, and would sacrifice much more than this, rather than lose"
6298,III,"thy favour and incur the anger of heaven."""
6299,III,
6300,III,"As falls the refreshing dew on the bristling ears of barley, when the"
6301,III,"crops are ripening, so fell the soft answer of Antilochus on the"
6302,III,"Spartan prince's heart, and the sharp stings of resentment pricked him"
6303,III,"no more.  ""Thou shalt have the prize,"" he said mildly, ""though it is"
6304,III,mine by right.  Thou art not wont to be so heedless of what is due to
6305,III,others: but this time thy young blood didst get the mastery of thy
6306,III,better sense.  Take heed that thou art not so reckless again.  I have
6307,III,"yielded to thee in this for thy father's sake, and for thine also; for"
6308,III,"ye have both suffered many things in my cause.""  And so the dispute,"
6309,III,"which threatened to disturb the harmony of the meeting, was happily"
6310,III,ended.
6311,III,
6312,III,"Five prizes had been offered for the race, and as Eumelus had received"
6313,III,"a special gift, the fifth prize, a drinking goblet, still remained"
6314,III,"unclaimed.  Observing this, Achilles seized the occasion of showing his"
6315,III,"esteem for the venerable King of Pylos.  So he took the cup, and going"
6316,III,"to the place where Nestor was sitting put it in his hands.  ""Take this,"
6317,III,"father,"" he said, ""as a memorial of our lost Patroclus, in whose honour"
6318,III,"we are met to-day.  Thou art full of years and honours, and deservest"
6319,III,"the highest prize of all, though thou canst not strive with young men"
6320,III,"in boxing, or in wrestling, or in speed of foot."""
6321,III,
6322,III,"""Thou sayest truly, my son,"" answered the old man, ""my feet are heavy"
6323,III,"with age, and my arms dart not nimbly from the shoulder, as they did of"
6324,III,yore.  Yet the day has been when none could vie with me in feats of
6325,III,strength and skill.  Well do I remember the funeral games of a noble
6326,III,"prince of Elis, where I won the prize in every contest, except only in"
6327,III,"the chariot race, and then I was overmatched by numbers, for the"
6328,III,"winning car had two drivers, one plying the lash, and the other"
6329,III,managing the reins.  Alas for my youth!  Alas for my vanished strength!
6330,III,"Now I must be content to see others excel, though once I was mighty"
6331,III,"among the mightiest.  Let then the games proceed, and receive an old"
6332,III,"man's blessing for thy kindly gift."""

6336,IV,
6337,IV,"""Now let the boxers try their skill and hardihood,"" said Achilles, when"
6338,IV,"he had returned to his seat.  ""Here is a stout mule of six years old"
6339,IV,"for the winner, and for the loser there is a silver cup."""
6340,IV,
6341,IV,In answer to the challenge a huge champion named Epeus strode into the
6342,IV,"ring, and, laying his hand on the mule, cried boastfully: ""Come on,"
6343,IV,"whoever wishes to win the cup!  The mule is surely mine, for there is"
6344,IV,no boxer here who can match me.  If there be anyone who would dispute
6345,IV,"the prize with me, let him stand up, when he has made all ready for his"
6346,IV,"funeral--for I will pound his flesh, and batter his bones, until he is"
6347,IV,"fit only for burial."""
6348,IV,
6349,IV,"Epeus, with his massive frame and brawny arms, seemed quite capable of"
6350,IV,"performing his threats, and it was some time before anyone was found"
6351,IV,"willing to face him.  At last Euryalus, an Argive, whose father had"
6352,IV,"been a famous boxer, was encouraged by his friend Diomede to try his"
6353,IV,chances in this painful and dangerous sport; and having stripped to the
6354,IV,"waist, and bound their hands with tough leathern thongs, the two"
6355,IV,combatants confronted each other in the centre of the ring.  The
6356,IV,"struggle was very short, for after they had fenced a little with their"
6357,IV,"fists Euryalus received a crushing blow on the side of his jaw, and"
6358,IV,"dropped in a heap where he stood, like a great fish flung by the waves"
6359,IV,"on the beach.  Spitting out blood, and rolling his head from side to"
6360,IV,"side, he was led away by his friends, and Epeus carried off the mule in"
6361,IV,triumph.
6362,IV,
6363,IV,Then followed a hard-contested match between Odysseus and Telamonian
6364,IV,"Ajax, for the championship in wrestling.  Stripped, like the boxers, to"
6365,IV,"the waist, they clutched each other in a fierce embrace, and remained"
6366,IV,"thus locked together, their strong arms crossed like the rafters in a"
6367,IV,"roof, and their sides growing black under the iron pressure.  They"
6368,IV,"seemed rooted to the ground, and neither could stir the other an inch."
6369,IV,"Then Ajax, suddenly exerting his enormous strength, lifted Odysseus"
6370,IV,bodily into the air; but Odysseus struck him with his heel behind the
6371,IV,"knee, and they fell together, Odysseus above, and Ajax below.  Rising"
6372,IV,"again to their feet they wrestled a second bout, and this time"
6373,IV,"Odysseus, though foiled in his attempt to lift the huge bulk of his"
6374,IV,"antagonist, succeeded in tripping him by a crook of the knee, and they"
6375,IV,"came down again, and lay side by side.  Once more they would have"
6376,IV,"renewed the struggle, but Achilles put an end to the contest, and"
6377,IV,awarded them an equal prize.
6378,IV,
6379,IV,"A beautiful silver bowl, the work of Sidonian artists, which Achilles"
6380,IV,"had once received as the ransom of the unhappy Lycaon, was now offered"
6381,IV,"as the first prize for the foot race.  The second prize was a fat ox,"
6382,IV,and the third one half of a talent of gold.  There were three
6383,IV,"competitors: the lesser Ajax, who was famed for his speed of foot,"
6384,IV,"Odysseus, and Antilochus.  The distance was about a furlong, and Ajax"
6385,IV,"took the lead from the start, though Odysseus pressed him so hard that"
6386,IV,"he seemed glued to him; and so they ran, without changing their"
6387,IV,"positions, over half the course, the Greeks shouting to encourage"
6388,IV,"Odysseus, who was a popular favourite.  Still Ajax held the lead, and"
6389,IV,"seemed about to win, when he slipped in a miry place, where the ground"
6390,IV,was wet with the blood of the oxen slaughtered by Achilles at the
6391,IV,"funeral of Patroclus, and pitched head foremost in the horrid mire,"
6392,IV,which filled his mouth and nostrils.  But he was on his feet again in a
6393,IV,"moment, and though he could not overtake Odysseus he succeeded in"
6394,IV,"obtaining the second prize.  ""It is an old story,"" he said, holding the"
6395,IV,"ox by the horn, and spitting out the slime which filled his mouth;"
6396,IV,"""Odysseus was helped by Athene, who watches over him as a mother over"
6397,IV,"her child."""
6398,IV,
6399,IV,"The Greeks laughed at his discomfiture, and found fresh matter for"
6400,IV,"mirth in the humorous excuses of Antilochus, who had been left far"
6401,IV,"behind in the race.  ""You know,"" he said, ""that the gods are always on"
6402,IV,"the side of the elder men; Ajax is a little older than I, and Odysseus"
6403,IV,"belongs to another generation.  But he is in a green old age, and none"
6404,IV,"can vie with him in speed, except only Achilles."""
6405,IV,
6406,IV,"""Thy praise shall not be spoken for nothing,"" said Achilles, smiling,"
6407,IV,and he gave him one half of a talent of gold as a reward for his good
6408,IV,words.
6409,IV,
6410,IV,"Contests in archery and throwing the weight succeeded, and an encounter"
6411,IV,with sword and spear took place between Ajax and Diomede.  Then
6412,IV,"Achilles offered two prizes for throwing the javelin, and Agamemnon, in"
6413,IV,"recognition of his high rank and known skill in this exercise, was"
6414,IV,allowed to take the first prize without a trial.  With this incident
6415,IV,the games came to an end.

6425,I,"bringing to all, save one tormented spirit, the blessed gift of sleep."
6426,I,With silence and solitude the pangs of sorrow awakened with new
6427,I,"keenness in the heart of Achilles, and he lay tossing and turning on"
6428,I,"his uneasy pillow, seeking rest, and finding none.  A thousand memories"
6429,I,"of his friendship with Patroclus--gallant adventures, hairbreadth"
6430,I,"escapes, moving accidents by flood and field--coursed through his mind,"
6431,I,bringing home to him the immensity of his loss.  After some hours of
6432,I,"sleepless misery he sprang to his feet, and throwing on his clothes"
6433,I,"went down to the sea, and roamed distracted along the sand.  With the"
6434,I,"first glimmer of daylight he yoked his horses to the car, and drove"
6435,I,"round and round the tomb of Patroclus, dragging after him the body of"
6436,I,"Hector.  Having made the circuit of the tomb three times, he unyoked"
6437,I,"his horses, and retired once more to his tent, leaving his lifeless"
6438,I,victim face downwards in the dust.
6439,I,
6440,I,Twelve days passed; and every day the same outrage was repeated.  All
6441,I,"the gods, except Poseidon, Hera, and Athene, whose hatred of all things"
6442,I,"Trojan was inveterate, were indignant at his senseless barbarity, and"
6443,I,"they began to urge Hermes to steal Hector's body, and restore it to his"
6444,I,"friends.  But nothing was done until, on the twelfth day, Apollo rose"
6445,I,"up and reproached the gods, who were met in full assembly, for their"
6446,I,"cruel indifference.  ""Is there no pity,"" he said, ""is there no justice,"
6447,I,"left in heaven, that ye suffer this inhuman son of Peleus to wreak his"
6448,I,"brutal fury on the body of a man of stainless life, constant all his"

6470,I,"Iris hastened to obey the command, and, stooping from Olympus to the"
6471,I,"surface of the sea, dropped like a leaden plummet into the purple"

6473,I,"sitting among the Nereids, mourning the lot of her matchless son, whose"
6474,I,"death was near at hand.  ""What wants the monarch of heaven from me?"""

6513,II,
6514,II,"Meanwhile the ever-active Iris was gone on another errand, carrying the"
6515,II,commands of Zeus to Priam.  Swiftly she passed through the streets of

6517,II,ceased since the day when Hector had fallen by the hands of Achilles.
6518,II,"Priam himself was lying prostrate on the ground in the courtyard, with"

6521,II,"windows were seen from time to time the white faces of women, when any"
6522,II,of his daughters paused in their household tasks to glance at the
6523,II,sorrow-stricken group outside.
6524,II,
6525,II,"Lying thus, mute and motionless, Priam was startled to hear a still,"
6526,II,"small voice, which seemed to be speaking at a great distance,"

6533,II,"only a herald go with thee, a man stricken in years like thyself, to"
6534,II,"guide the mules.  Fear nothing, for heaven is near thee, and the gods"

6536,II,
6537,II,"To the amazement of those who stood near, and who knew nothing of the"
6538,II,"cause, new life and energy were seen to enter the palsied limbs of"

6540,II,"car, and make fast to it the great wicker basket which was used for the"
6541,II,"carriage of goods.  Then, without staying for question or reply, he"
6542,II,"hastened into the house, and calling to Hecuba made known to her his"
6543,II,"purpose.  When she heard what he intended, Hecuba lifted up her hands,"
6544,II,"and answered in tones of astonishment and terror.  ""Is it Priam who"
6545,II,speaks--the monarch revered for his wisdom even in distant lands--or is
6546,II,"it some madman who has taken upon him Priam's likeness?  What, wilt"
6547,II,"thou go into the presence of that butcher, whose savage hands have made"
6548,II,"thee all but childless?  Faithless and ruthless as he is, thinkest thou"
6549,II,"that he will reverence thy grey hairs?  No, he will slaughter thee"
6550,II,"without pity, and give us new cause for tears.  Hector hath received"
6551,II,"the portion appointed to him at his birth, and dogs shall eat his flesh"
6552,II,where he lies in the tent of that man of blood.  May the curse of
6553,II,heaven light on his slayer!  Would that I could tear his heart with my
6554,II,"teeth, and devour it!  Then would my noble son be avenged, who died"
6555,II,"bravely before the face of all his people, with no thought of flight or"
6556,II,"escape."""
6557,II,
6558,II,"But Priam was not to be shaken in his resolve.  ""Seek not to hinder"
6559,II,"me,"" he answered, ""and vex me not with thy evil forebodings.  I go not"
6560,II,"at the bidding of any earthly prophet, but with direct assurance of the"
6561,II,"aid and countenance of heaven.  If I have been deceived, I am prepared"
6562,II,"to die, so that the stroke but find me holding my son in my arms, and"
6563,II,"clinging to him in a last embrace."""
6564,II,
6565,II,"With that he went to his treasure-chamber, and opening the chests of"
6566,II,"cedarwood took from them rich robes, choice tapestries, and costly"
6567,II,"raiment.  To these he added ten talents of gold and a bowl of silver,"
6568,II,which he had received as a gift of honour when he went on an embassy to
6569,II,Thrace.  And having set the gifts in order he went forth again into the
6570,II,"courtyard, to hasten the preparations for his journey.  Finding there a"
6571,II,"crowd of Trojans, whom some rumour had drawn to the palace, he drove"
6572,II,"them all out, beating them with his staff, and crying: ""What make ye"
6573,II,"here, idle caitiffs?  Have ye not sorrow enough at home that ye come"
6574,II,hither to chatter and pry into my grief?  Ye will soon learn what ye
6575,II,"have lost in my Hector, when ye fly like sheep without a shepherd"
6576,II,"before the wolves of Greece.""  The Trojans fled before the old man's"
6577,II,"anger, and he looked about him, seeking his sons.  ""Where are ye,"" he"
6578,II,"cried, ""children of my shame?  Would that ye had all perished, and"
6579,II,"Hector alone were left!  Alas! the best are ever taken first, and in"
6580,II,"those that remain there is neither comfort nor strength, but only"
6581,II,"dishonour and reproach.  Liars, dancers, devourers of the people--these"
6582,II,"are my children now."""
6583,II,
6584,II,"Roused by the loud rebukes of their father, the young princes made"
6585,II,haste to bring forth the mule car and harness the mules.  Then they
6586,II,"loaded the car with the gifts to Achilles, and yoked to the chariot the"
6587,II,horses which Priam himself was to drive.
6588,II,
6589,II,"When all was ready, Hecuba came and stood by the chariot, bearing a"
6590,II,"golden cup filled with wine.  ""Take this,"" she said to Priam, ""and pour"
6591,II,"a drink-offering to Zeus, if so be that he will vouchsafe thee a sign,"
6592,II,and show thee whether it be by his will or not that thou goest on this
6593,II,"journey."""
6594,II,
6595,II,"""Thou sayest well,"" answered Priam.  ""It is a good thing to hold up our"
6596,II,"hands to heaven in prayer.""  Thereupon he washed his hands in water,"
6597,II,"which was brought by a handmaid, took the cup from his wife, and"
6598,II,standing by the altar in the middle of the courtyard lifted up his
6599,II,"voice and prayed: ""Lord of Ida, most glorious, most great, grant that"
6600,II,"the heart of Achilles may incline in pity towards me, and send thy"
6601,II,"messenger, the swift eagle whom thou lovest best of all fowls, that"
6602,II,having seen him we may go with good heart and courage to the Grecian
6603,II,"camp."""
6604,II,
6605,II,"Even as he spoke, a mighty eagle was seen soaring over the city on the"
6606,II,"right hand, with his vast wings outspread, like the folding doors of a"
6607,II,"rich man's house.  Rejoicing in the omen, Priam mounted his chariot,"
6608,II,"and drove through the echoing porch, preceded by the herald Idæus, who"
6609,II,"drove the mule car.  Along the streets they passed, making what speed"
6610,II,"they could, through the multitudes who had flocked out to see them"
6611,II,"depart, and who mourned them as already dead."
6612,II,
6613,II,"Night had fallen, and all the sky was thick set with stars, as they"
6614,II,"left the city gates, and turned their faces towards the sea.  When they"
6615,II,reached the ford of the river they paused to let the animals drink: and
6616,II,"while they halted Idæus suddenly cried out in tones of terror: ""My"
6617,II,"lord, we are undone!  I see a man approaching, and I fear he means us"
6618,II,"no good.""  Priam peered out into the darkness, following with his eyes"
6619,II,"the pointing finger of Idæus, and saw a tall figure moving with rapid"
6620,II,steps towards them.
6621,II,
6622,II,"""What doest thou here?"" said the stranger, who was a graceful and"
6623,II,"comely youth, and whose voice sounded like the chiming of a silver"
6624,II,"bell.  ""Why art thou here unguarded, at the very gates of the foe?  But"
6625,II,"be of good cheer--I will not harm thee, nor suffer others to do so.  I"
6626,II,"see in thee a likeness to my dear father."""
6627,II,
6628,II,"""Fair youth,"" answered Priam, whose alarm had vanished before the"
6629,II,"gentle mien and kind words of the young Greek, ""surely some god has"
6630,II,"sent thee in my way, in pity for my helpless state.  Tell me, who art"
6631,II,"thou, and who is the father who is blest with such a son?"""
6632,II,
6633,II,"""I am a follower of Achilles,"" was the startling reply, ""and came"
6634,II,"hither in the same ship.  My father is Polyctor, a wealthy man, and of"
6635,II,"like age with thee.  I am the youngest of seven sons, and the lot fell"
6636,II,upon me to follow the host to Troy.  And this night I came out to spy
6637,II,"upon the movements of the Trojans."""
6638,II,
6639,II,"""If thou art a comrade of Achilles,"" said Priam, ""thou canst tell me"
6640,II,"concerning my son Hector.  Lies his body still by the ships, or has"
6641,II,"Achilles given it already to his dogs to devour?"""
6642,II,
6643,II,"""Neither dog,"" answered the other, ""nor unclean fowl hath approached"
6644,II,"him, nor hath the worm had power over his flesh.  Unmarred by violence,"
6645,II,"untouched by decay, he lieth, without soil or stain, and all his wounds"
6646,II,"are closed.  This miracle the gods have wrought, in the great love"
6647,II,"which they bear him."""
6648,II,
6649,II,"""Glad news thou tellest me,"" said Priam, ""and now I know that piety"
6650,II,"hath its reward, even in death.""  Then he took out a silver cup from"
6651,II,"the mule car, and offering it to the stranger said: ""Take this for"
6652,II,"thyself, and conduct me safe to the ships of Achilles, that I may see"
6653,II,"the face of my son."""
6654,II,
6655,II,"""Tempt me not, old man,"" replied the Greek.  ""This cup belongs to"
6656,II,"Achilles, and if I should steal it from him what thinkest thou that he"
6657,II,"would do unto me?  But come, give me the reins, and I will guide thee"
6658,II,"to thy goal--yea, though it were in distant Argos, thou shouldst reach"
6659,II,"it safe and sound, and none should molest thee."""
6660,II,
6661,II,"So saying, he sprang to the side of Priam, and took the reins.  Under"
6662,II,"his guidance the horses seemed to be endued with wings, and in a very"
6663,II,short time they reached the main entrance of the camp.  The gates flew
6664,II,"open, as if by magic, and all the sentries were sleeping at their"
6665,II,"posts.  On to the extreme verge of the camp they went, still"
6666,II,"unchallenged, and drew up at length before a high stockade, within"
6667,II,which were the quarters of Achilles.  Once more the gates opened at a
6668,II,"touch, and they entered.  Here the mysterious stranger dismounted from"
6669,II,"the car, and turning on Priam a countenance which shone with a"
6670,II,"celestial radiance he said: ""I have brought thee to the place where"
6671,II,"thou wouldst go, and now I will leave thee, for the task is finished"
6672,II,"which Zeus my father gave me to do.  For know that I am Hermes, the"
6673,II,"herald of the gods, and the strong helper of those that are in need."""
6674,II,
6675,II,
6676,III,III
6677,III,
6678,III,"The dwelling of Achilles, which, for want of a better word, we have"
6679,III,"called a tent, was in reality a roomy building, constructed of solid"
6680,III,"pine trunks, and thatched with moss and rushes.  On this memorable"
6681,III,"evening Achilles was sitting in the main apartment of the dwelling, and"
6682,III,two of his squires were removing the vessels used at the evening meal.
6683,III,"The light of the fire gleamed fitfully on his face, and he seemed in a"
6684,III,gentler and more placid mood than had been usual with him for many
6685,III,"days.  He had partaken freely of food and wine, and conversed"
6686,III,"cheerfully with his attendants.  He was now silent, and sat musing"
6687,III,"quietly by himself, when suddenly, to his amazement, an old man of tall"
6688,III,"stature and regal port entered the room, and throwing himself on the"
6689,III,ground before him clasped his knees and kissed his hands--those
6690,III,terrible murderous hands!--bathing them with his tears.  Like a man who
6691,III,"has slain a fellow-countryman, and enters the house of some wealthy"
6692,III,"noble, where a great company is gathered, to implore shelter and"
6693,III,protection--for the avenger of blood is at his heels--so seemed that
6694,III,"aged man to Achilles and those that were with him, so trembling,"
6695,III,"helpless, and forlorn.  And as they gazed in deep wonder, murmuring to"
6696,III,"each other the name of Priam, he began, in a voice broken with weeping,"
6697,III,"to urge his petition: ""Pity me, Achilles, for thy father's sake, an old"
6698,III,"man like me, standing on the brink of the grave.  Maybe he is in sole"
6699,III,"straits, oppressed by those that dwell about him, for want of thy"
6700,III,"succouring arm.  Yet still he has hope, as long as thou livest, and"
6701,III,"looks forward to the joyful day of thy return.  But what hope have I,"
6702,III,"what solace, what refuge from the blows which fate aims without ceasing"
6703,III,"at mine afflicted head?  Fifty sons I had, when the sons of Greece"
6704,III,"first came to these shores, and of these the greater part have paid"
6705,III,"their last tribute to the stern god of war.  And he, the bravest and"
6706,III,"the best, the bulwark of my city, fell by thy hand not many days since."
6707,III,"Him have I come to ransom at a great price.  In the name of thy father,"
6708,III,"in the name of the gods whom we both adore, have mercy on me,"
6709,III,"Achilles--on me, who have found it in my heart to do what mortal never"
6710,III,"did before, to lift to my lips the hand that slew my son!"""
6711,III,
6712,III,Then at last that iron-hearted man was melted into compassion when he
6713,III,"saw the renowned King of Asia prostrate at his feet, humbled to the"
6714,III,dust for the sake of one poor boon--permission to give his son's body
6715,III,to the grave.  And the sight of all that misery awakened anew the
6716,III,"thought of his own sad lot, his recent loss, his brief and troubled"
6717,III,"life, soon to be ended by a coward's hand, the desolation of his home,"
6718,III,and his father pining in solitary old age.  Surely he also had cause
6719,III,enough for tears!
6720,III,
6721,III,So the two great enemies were united for the time by the common bond of
6722,III,"human sorrow.  Then Achilles rose, and, taking the old man by the hand,"
6723,III,"led him to a seat, and placing himself by his side said to him: ""O"
6724,III,"marked by sorrow's seal before all the children of men, what a heart"
6725,III,"must thou have, to meet me face to face, who have given to death so"
6726,III,many of thy valiant sons!  But thou knowest that it is the common lot:
6727,III,"only the gods know neither care nor grief, but mortal life is"
6728,III,encompassed with ills.  Two caskets there are which stand by the throne
6729,III,"of Zeus, one filled with good gifts, and the other with evil gifts."
6730,III,"And for the more part Zeus mingles the gifts, and tempers much evil"
6731,III,with a little good; but now and then some wretch receives naught but
6732,III,"evil, and wanders from land to land as misery's thrall, branded by the"
6733,III,"malice of fate.  To Peleus, my father, good things were given at"
6734,III,"first--wealth, power, and prosperity, and a goddess for his bride.  But"
6735,III,"now he is receiving his portion of ill.  And thou too, Priam, wast in"
6736,III,"old times renowned for the number of thy blessings, and men called thee"
6737,III,"great king, happy father, and envied thine abundance.  But in thy"
6738,III,"latter years thou hast seen naught but wars and fightings, losses and"
6739,III,"deaths.  So shifts the tide, so turns the scale, now up, now down, and"
6740,III,naught that we can do will avail to raise or diminish by one tittle the
6741,III,"sum of our fate."""
6742,III,
6743,III,Up to this point Priam had prospered in his mission beyond his hopes.
6744,III,But now he obtained a glimpse of the fearful passions which were
6745,III,"smouldering in the breast of Achilles, and ready at any moment to leap"
6746,III,up in devouring flames.  Being invited by Achilles to stay and rest
6747,III,"awhile before resuming his journey, he would have refused, alleging"
6748,III,that he could not rest until he had the body of Hector safe in his
6749,III,keeping.  But that fierce and imperious nature brooked not the
6750,III,"slightest hint of opposition.  ""Provoke me no further, old man,"" said"
6751,III,"the terrible chieftain, with a dark glance at his guest.  ""Hector's"
6752,III,body thou shalt have--but there must be no unseemly haste.  My heart is
6753,III,"exceeding sore; touch not thou the galled spot, lest I should do thee"
6754,III,"mischief, and break the ordinances of heaven."""
6755,III,
6756,III,"Then, leaving Priam where he sat, Achilles went out with Automedon and"
6757,III,"another of his squires, and, bidding Idæus attend his master, they"
6758,III,"unyoked the mules, and brought in the ransom.  ""Now, haste thee,"
6759,III,"Automedon,"" said Achilles, in a low tone, ""go with the handmaids to the"
6760,III,"place where Hector's body lies, and when they have washed and anointed"
6761,III,"it return with it hither.  Be silent, and be wary; for if Priam sees"
6762,III,"what ye are doing--if he catches sight of Hector's body, where now it"
6763,III,"lies--I fear that he will break out into anger against me, and becoming"
6764,III,"outrageous provoke me to slay him."""
6765,III,
6766,III,"Having carried out their orders with all due caution, they brought the"
6767,III,"body, wrapped in fine linen, and Achilles with his own hands placed it"
6768,III,in the mule car.  But he groaned in spirit when he thought of his
6769,III,"promise to Patroclus, and cried aloud, invoking his ghost: ""Take it not"
6770,III,"amiss, my Patroclus, when the news reaches thee in the house of the"
6771,III,"dead, that I have restored the body of thy slayer.  His father hath"
6772,III,"paid me no mean ransom, whereof thou shalt have thy share."""
6773,III,
6774,III,The laws of hospitality required that Priam should not leave Achilles'
6775,III,"roof without breaking bread.  Accordingly, on his return to the house,"
6776,III,"Achilles urged his guest to take some food.  ""Remember,"" he said, ""that"
6777,III,"Niobe herself, so constant in her sorrow that even now, though turned"
6778,III,"to a stone, she weeps and weeps for ever--even she tasted food when the"
6779,III,first anguish of her grief was passed.  Thou knowest her sad story--how
6780,III,"she boasted that she had borne twelve fair children, six stalwart sons"
6781,III,and six lovely daughters--and taunted Leto that she had only borne two.
6782,III,"But those two were Apollo and Artemis, a god and a goddess, and they"
6783,III,"slew all the children of Niobe, to avenge the insult to their mother."
6784,III,"Apollo slew the sons with his silver bow, and Artemis, the"
6785,III,"archer-goddess, slew the daughters.  For nine days they lay in their"
6786,III,"blood, with none to give them burial; but on the tenth day the gods"
6787,III,"buried them with their own hands.  And if she, that stricken mother,"
6788,III,"could sit down to meat, so do thou also, Priam; after that, thou shall"
6789,III,"take some sleep, and at dawn I will send thee back in safety to Troy."""
6790,III,
6791,III,"The meal was prepared, and they sat down face to face at the same"
6792,III,"table, joined as host and guest, after all that had passed between"
6793,III,"them.  But Priam's eyes were exceeding heavy, for he had hardly closed"
6794,III,them in slumber since the awful day when he saw Hector stricken to
6795,III,death before his sight; and after tasting a morsel he begged Achilles
6796,III,to show him the place where he was to rest.
6797,III,
6798,III,
6799,IV,IV
6800,IV,
6801,IV,Priam's bed was laid under the portico which ran round the outside of
6802,IV,"the dwelling, for fear lest any chance visitor to Achilles should see"
6803,IV,"him if he lay within.  Overcome by weariness, he soon fell into a deep"
6804,IV,"sleep.  But in the dead of night he was roused by the voice of Hermes,"
6805,IV,"whose watchful eye had never left him, and who now came to warn him of"
6806,IV,the perils by which he was surrounded.  What if Agamemnon should hear
6807,IV,that the King of Troy was lying asleep in the midst of the Grecian
6808,IV,camp!  All the wealth of Troy would hardly suffice to ransom such a
6809,IV,prisoner.
6810,IV,
6811,IV,"Priam rose in haste, now fully alive to his danger, and found the"
6812,IV,"horses ready harnessed, and Idæus waiting with the mule car.  The same"
6813,IV,powerful hand which had brought them to the dwelling of Achilles now
6814,IV,"smoothed the way for their return, and day was just breaking as they"
6815,IV,crossed the ford of the river.
6816,IV,
6817,IV,"The first to observe their coming was Cassandra, a daughter of Priam,"
6818,IV,who was watching from the highest tower of the citadel; and the report
6819,IV,"soon spread throughout the city that Priam was returning, bringing with"
6820,IV,him the body of Hector.  Then not a man nor a woman was left in the
6821,IV,"city, but all with one accord streamed out through the gates to meet"
6822,IV,"the strange procession.  There was seen Hecuba, the mother of the"
6823,IV,"slain, leaning on the shoulder of Andromache, his faithful wife; and"
6824,IV,"following them at a distance, with downcast eyes, avoiding the looks of"
6825,IV,"hate which were cast at her, went the fatal Helen.  During all the"
6826,IV,"years that she had lived as an unwelcome guest in the house of Priam,"
6827,IV,Hector had never reminded her by a look or a word of the miseries which
6828,IV,"she had brought on his country.  He was all gentleness, all goodness,"
6829,IV,"even to her, who had sinned so grievously against him and his people;"
6830,IV,and when hard words were aimed at her by any of his kinsfolk his
6831,IV,patience and charity had ever been her shield.
6832,IV,
6833,IV,By the authority of Achilles a truce of eleven days was granted to the
6834,IV,Trojans to celebrate the obsequies of Hector.  For nine days he lay in
6835,IV,"the chamber prepared for him in the palace, and all the city was given"
6836,IV,"up to mourning.  On the tenth day they buried him, and on the eleventh"
6837,IV,they raised his monument.
6838,IV,
6839,IV,"And so, after long delay, that knightly spirit passed into its rest."
