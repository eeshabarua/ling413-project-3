44,CANTO XXIX,
45,CANTO XXIX,SO were mine eyes inebriate with view
46,CANTO XXIX,"Of the vast multitude, whom various wounds"
47,CANTO XXIX,"Disfigur'd, that they long'd to stay and weep."
48,CANTO XXIX,
49,CANTO XXIX,"But Virgil rous'd me: ""What yet gazest on?"
50,CANTO XXIX,Wherefore doth fasten yet thy sight below
51,CANTO XXIX,Among the maim'd and miserable shades?
52,CANTO XXIX,Thou hast not shewn in any chasm beside
53,CANTO XXIX,"This weakness.  Know, if thou wouldst number them"
54,CANTO XXIX,That two and twenty miles the valley winds
55,CANTO XXIX,"Its circuit, and already is the moon"
56,CANTO XXIX,Beneath our feet: the time permitted now
57,CANTO XXIX,"Is short, and more not seen remains to see."""
58,CANTO XXIX,
59,CANTO XXIX,"""If thou,"" I straight replied, ""hadst weigh'd the cause"
60,CANTO XXIX,"For which I look'd, thou hadst perchance excus'd"
61,CANTO XXIX,"The tarrying still.""  My leader part pursu'd"
62,CANTO XXIX,"His way, the while I follow'd, answering him,"
63,CANTO XXIX,"And adding thus: ""Within that cave I deem,"
64,CANTO XXIX,"Whereon so fixedly I held my ken,"
65,CANTO XXIX,"There is a spirit dwells, one of my blood,"
66,CANTO XXIX,"Wailing the crime that costs him now so dear."""
67,CANTO XXIX,
68,CANTO XXIX,"Then spake my master: ""Let thy soul no more"
69,CANTO XXIX,Afflict itself for him.  Direct elsewhere
70,CANTO XXIX,"Its thought, and leave him.  At the bridge's foot"
71,CANTO XXIX,I mark'd how he did point with menacing look
72,CANTO XXIX,"At thee, and heard him by the others nam'd"
73,CANTO XXIX,Geri of Bello.  Thou so wholly then
74,CANTO XXIX,"Wert busied with his spirit, who once rul'd"
75,CANTO XXIX,"The towers of Hautefort, that thou lookedst not"
76,CANTO XXIX,"That way, ere he was gone.""--""O guide belov'd!"
77,CANTO XXIX,"His violent death yet unaveng'd,"" said I,"
78,CANTO XXIX,"""By any, who are partners in his shame,"
79,CANTO XXIX,"Made him contemptuous: therefore, as I think,"
80,CANTO XXIX,He pass'd me speechless by; and doing so
81,CANTO XXIX,"Hath made me more compassionate his fate."""
82,CANTO XXIX,
83,CANTO XXIX,So we discours'd to where the rock first show'd
84,CANTO XXIX,"The other valley, had more light been there,"
85,CANTO XXIX,E'en to the lowest depth.  Soon as we came
86,CANTO XXIX,O'er the last cloister in the dismal rounds
87,CANTO XXIX,"Of Malebolge, and the brotherhood"
88,CANTO XXIX,"Were to our view expos'd, then many a dart"
89,CANTO XXIX,"Of sore lament assail'd me, headed all"
90,CANTO XXIX,"With points of thrilling pity, that I clos'd"
91,CANTO XXIX,Both ears against the volley with mine hands.
92,CANTO XXIX,
93,CANTO XXIX,"As were the torment, if each lazar-house"
94,CANTO XXIX,"Of Valdichiana, in the sultry time"
95,CANTO XXIX,"'Twixt July and September, with the isle"
96,CANTO XXIX,"Sardinia and Maremma's pestilent fen,"
97,CANTO XXIX,Had heap'd their maladies all in one foss
98,CANTO XXIX,Together; such was here the torment: dire
99,CANTO XXIX,"The stench, as issuing steams from fester'd limbs."
100,CANTO XXIX,
101,CANTO XXIX,We on the utmost shore of the long rock
102,CANTO XXIX,Descended still to leftward.  Then my sight
103,CANTO XXIX,"Was livelier to explore the depth, wherein"
104,CANTO XXIX,"The minister of the most mighty Lord,"
105,CANTO XXIX,"All-searching Justice, dooms to punishment"
106,CANTO XXIX,The forgers noted on her dread record.
107,CANTO XXIX,
108,CANTO XXIX,More rueful was it not methinks to see
109,CANTO XXIX,"The nation in Aegina droop, what time"
110,CANTO XXIX,"Each living thing, e'en to the little worm,"
111,CANTO XXIX,"All fell, so full of malice was the air"
112,CANTO XXIX,"(And afterward, as bards of yore have told,"
113,CANTO XXIX,The ancient people were restor'd anew
114,CANTO XXIX,From seed of emmets) than was here to see
115,CANTO XXIX,"The spirits, that languish'd through the murky vale"
116,CANTO XXIX,"Up-pil'd on many a stack.  Confus'd they lay,"
117,CANTO XXIX,"One o'er the belly, o'er the shoulders one"
118,CANTO XXIX,Roll'd of another; sideling crawl'd a third
119,CANTO XXIX,Along the dismal pathway.  Step by step
120,CANTO XXIX,"We journey'd on, in silence looking round"
121,CANTO XXIX,"And list'ning those diseas'd, who strove in vain"
122,CANTO XXIX,"To lift their forms.  Then two I mark'd, that sat"
123,CANTO XXIX,"Propp'd 'gainst each other, as two brazen pans"
124,CANTO XXIX,"Set to retain the heat.  From head to foot,"
125,CANTO XXIX,A tetter bark'd them round. Nor saw I e'er
126,CANTO XXIX,"Groom currying so fast, for whom his lord"
127,CANTO XXIX,"Impatient waited, or himself perchance"
128,CANTO XXIX,"Tir'd with long watching, as of these each one"
129,CANTO XXIX,"Plied quickly his keen nails, through furiousness"
130,CANTO XXIX,Of ne'er abated pruriency.  The crust
131,CANTO XXIX,"Came drawn from underneath in flakes, like scales"
132,CANTO XXIX,Scrap'd from the bream or fish of broader mail.
133,CANTO XXIX,
134,CANTO XXIX,"""O thou, who with thy fingers rendest off"
135,CANTO XXIX,"Thy coat of proof,"" thus spake my guide to one,"
136,CANTO XXIX,"""And sometimes makest tearing pincers of them,"
137,CANTO XXIX,Tell me if any born of Latian land
138,CANTO XXIX,Be among these within: so may thy nails
139,CANTO XXIX,"Serve thee for everlasting to this toil."""
140,CANTO XXIX,
141,CANTO XXIX,"""Both are of Latium,"" weeping he replied,"
142,CANTO XXIX,"""Whom tortur'd thus thou seest: but who art thou"
143,CANTO XXIX,"That hast inquir'd of us?""  To whom my guide:"
144,CANTO XXIX,"""One that descend with this man, who yet lives,"
145,CANTO XXIX,"From rock to rock, and show him hell's abyss."""
146,CANTO XXIX,
147,CANTO XXIX,"Then started they asunder, and each turn'd"
148,CANTO XXIX,"Trembling toward us, with the rest, whose ear"
149,CANTO XXIX,Those words redounding struck.  To me my liege
150,CANTO XXIX,"Address'd him: ""Speak to them whate'er thou list."""
151,CANTO XXIX,
152,CANTO XXIX,"And I therewith began: ""So may no time"
153,CANTO XXIX,Filch your remembrance from the thoughts of men
154,CANTO XXIX,"In th' upper world, but after many suns"
155,CANTO XXIX,"Survive it, as ye tell me, who ye are,"
156,CANTO XXIX,"And of what race ye come.  Your punishment,"
157,CANTO XXIX,"Unseemly and disgustful in its kind,"
158,CANTO XXIX,"Deter you not from opening thus much to me."""
159,CANTO XXIX,
160,CANTO XXIX,"""Arezzo was my dwelling,"" answer'd one,"
161,CANTO XXIX,"""And me Albero of Sienna brought"
162,CANTO XXIX,"To die by fire; but that, for which I died,"
163,CANTO XXIX,"Leads me not here.  True is in sport I told him,"
164,CANTO XXIX,That I had learn'd to wing my flight in air.
165,CANTO XXIX,"And he admiring much, as he was void"
166,CANTO XXIX,"Of wisdom, will'd me to declare to him"
167,CANTO XXIX,"The secret of mine art: and only hence,"
168,CANTO XXIX,"Because I made him not a Daedalus,"
169,CANTO XXIX,Prevail'd on one suppos'd his sire to burn me.
170,CANTO XXIX,"But Minos to this chasm last of the ten,"
171,CANTO XXIX,"For that I practis'd alchemy on earth,"
172,CANTO XXIX,"Has doom'd me.  Him no subterfuge eludes."""
173,CANTO XXIX,
174,CANTO XXIX,"Then to the bard I spake: ""Was ever race"
175,CANTO XXIX,Light as Sienna's?  Sure not France herself
176,CANTO XXIX,"Can show a tribe so frivolous and vain."""
177,CANTO XXIX,
178,CANTO XXIX,"The other leprous spirit heard my words,"
179,CANTO XXIX,"And thus return'd: ""Be Stricca from this charge"
180,CANTO XXIX,"Exempted, he who knew so temp'rately"
181,CANTO XXIX,To lay out fortune's gifts; and Niccolo
182,CANTO XXIX,Who first the spice's costly luxury
183,CANTO XXIX,"Discover'd in that garden, where such seed"
184,CANTO XXIX,Roots deepest in the soil: and be that troop
185,CANTO XXIX,"Exempted, with whom Caccia of Asciano"
186,CANTO XXIX,"Lavish'd his vineyards and wide-spreading woods,"
187,CANTO XXIX,And his rare wisdom Abbagliato show'd
188,CANTO XXIX,A spectacle for all.  That thou mayst know
189,CANTO XXIX,Who seconds thee against the Siennese
190,CANTO XXIX,"Thus gladly, bend this way thy sharpen'd sight,"
191,CANTO XXIX,That well my face may answer to thy ken;
192,CANTO XXIX,"So shalt thou see I am Capocchio's ghost,"
193,CANTO XXIX,Who forg'd transmuted metals by the power
194,CANTO XXIX,"Of alchemy; and if I scan thee right,"
195,CANTO XXIX,Thus needs must well remember how I aped
196,CANTO XXIX,"Creative nature by my subtle art."""

200,CANTO XXIX,
201,CANTO XXX,CANTO XXX
202,CANTO XXX,
203,CANTO XXX,WHAT time resentment burn'd in Juno's breast
204,CANTO XXX,"For Semele against the Theban blood,"
205,CANTO XXX,"As more than once in dire mischance was rued,"
206,CANTO XXX,"Such fatal frenzy seiz'd on Athamas,"
207,CANTO XXX,That he his spouse beholding with a babe
208,CANTO XXX,"Laden on either arm, ""Spread out,"" he cried,"
209,CANTO XXX,"""The meshes, that I take the lioness"
210,CANTO XXX,"And the young lions at the pass:"" then forth"
211,CANTO XXX,"Stretch'd he his merciless talons, grasping one,"
212,CANTO XXX,"One helpless innocent, Learchus nam'd,"
213,CANTO XXX,"Whom swinging down he dash'd upon a rock,"
214,CANTO XXX,And with her other burden self-destroy'd
215,CANTO XXX,The hapless mother plung'd: and when the pride
216,CANTO XXX,"Of all-presuming Troy fell from its height,"
217,CANTO XXX,"By fortune overwhelm'd, and the old king"
218,CANTO XXX,"With his realm perish'd, then did Hecuba,"
219,CANTO XXX,"A wretch forlorn and captive, when she saw"
220,CANTO XXX,"Polyxena first slaughter'd, and her son,"
221,CANTO XXX,"Her Polydorus, on the wild sea-beach"
222,CANTO XXX,"Next met the mourner's view, then reft of sense"
223,CANTO XXX,Did she run barking even as a dog;
224,CANTO XXX,Such mighty power had grief to wrench her soul.
225,CANTO XXX,Bet ne'er the Furies or of Thebes or Troy
226,CANTO XXX,"With such fell cruelty were seen, their goads"
227,CANTO XXX,"Infixing in the limbs of man or beast,"
228,CANTO XXX,As now two pale and naked ghost I saw
229,CANTO XXX,"That gnarling wildly scamper'd, like the swine"
230,CANTO XXX,"Excluded from his stye.  One reach'd Capocchio,"
231,CANTO XXX,"And in the neck-joint sticking deep his fangs,"
232,CANTO XXX,"Dragg'd him, that o'er the solid pavement rubb'd"
233,CANTO XXX,"His belly stretch'd out prone.  The other shape,"
234,CANTO XXX,"He of Arezzo, there left trembling, spake;"
235,CANTO XXX,"""That sprite of air is Schicchi; in like mood"
236,CANTO XXX,"Of random mischief vent he still his spite."""
237,CANTO XXX,
238,CANTO XXX,"To whom I answ'ring: ""Oh! as thou dost hope,"
239,CANTO XXX,"The other may not flesh its jaws on thee,"
240,CANTO XXX,"Be patient to inform us, who it is,"
241,CANTO XXX,"Ere it speed hence.""--""That is the ancient soul"
242,CANTO XXX,"Of wretched Myrrha,"" he replied, ""who burn'd"
243,CANTO XXX,"With most unholy flame for her own sire,"
244,CANTO XXX,
245,CANTO XXX,"""And a false shape assuming, so perform'd"
246,CANTO XXX,"The deed of sin; e'en as the other there,"
247,CANTO XXX,"That onward passes, dar'd to counterfeit"
248,CANTO XXX,"Donati's features, to feign'd testament"
249,CANTO XXX,"The seal affixing, that himself might gain,"
250,CANTO XXX,"For his own share, the lady of the herd."""
251,CANTO XXX,
252,CANTO XXX,"When vanish'd the two furious shades, on whom"
253,CANTO XXX,"Mine eye was held, I turn'd it back to view"
254,CANTO XXX,The other cursed spirits.  One I saw
255,CANTO XXX,"In fashion like a lute, had but the groin"
256,CANTO XXX,"Been sever'd, where it meets the forked part."
257,CANTO XXX,"Swoln dropsy, disproportioning the limbs"
258,CANTO XXX,"With ill-converted moisture, that the paunch"
259,CANTO XXX,"Suits not the visage, open'd wide his lips"
260,CANTO XXX,"Gasping as in the hectic man for drought,"
261,CANTO XXX,"One towards the chin, the other upward curl'd."
262,CANTO XXX,
263,CANTO XXX,"""O ye, who in this world of misery,"
264,CANTO XXX,"Wherefore I know not, are exempt from pain,"""
265,CANTO XXX,"Thus he began, ""attentively regard"
266,CANTO XXX,"Adamo's woe.  When living, full supply"
267,CANTO XXX,Ne'er lack'd me of what most I coveted;
268,CANTO XXX,"One drop of water now, alas!  I crave."
269,CANTO XXX,"The rills, that glitter down the grassy slopes"
270,CANTO XXX,"Of Casentino, making fresh and soft"
271,CANTO XXX,"The banks whereby they glide to Arno's stream,"
272,CANTO XXX,Stand ever in my view; and not in vain;
273,CANTO XXX,"For more the pictur'd semblance dries me up,"
274,CANTO XXX,"Much more than the disease, which makes the flesh"
275,CANTO XXX,"Desert these shrivel'd cheeks.  So from the place,"
276,CANTO XXX,"Where I transgress'd, stern justice urging me,"
277,CANTO XXX,Takes means to quicken more my lab'ring sighs.
278,CANTO XXX,"There is Romena, where I falsified"
279,CANTO XXX,"The metal with the Baptist's form imprest,"
280,CANTO XXX,For which on earth I left my body burnt.
281,CANTO XXX,But if I here might see the sorrowing soul
282,CANTO XXX,"Of Guido, Alessandro, or their brother,"
283,CANTO XXX,For Branda's limpid spring I would not change
284,CANTO XXX,"The welcome sight.  One is e'en now within,"
285,CANTO XXX,"If truly the mad spirits tell, that round"
286,CANTO XXX,Are wand'ring.  But wherein besteads me that?
287,CANTO XXX,"My limbs are fetter'd.  Were I but so light,"
288,CANTO XXX,"That I each hundred years might move one inch,"
289,CANTO XXX,"I had set forth already on this path,"
290,CANTO XXX,"Seeking him out amidst the shapeless crew,"
291,CANTO XXX,"Although eleven miles it wind, not more"
292,CANTO XXX,Than half of one across.  They brought me down
293,CANTO XXX,Among this tribe; induc'd by them I stamp'd
294,CANTO XXX,"The florens with three carats of alloy."""
295,CANTO XXX,
296,CANTO XXX,"""Who are that abject pair,"" I next inquir'd,"
297,CANTO XXX,"""That closely bounding thee upon thy right"
298,CANTO XXX,"Lie smoking, like a band in winter steep'd"
299,CANTO XXX,"In the chill stream?""--""When to this gulf I dropt,"""
300,CANTO XXX,"He answer'd, ""here I found them; since that hour"
301,CANTO XXX,"They have not turn'd, nor ever shall, I ween,"
302,CANTO XXX,Till time hath run his course.  One is that dame
303,CANTO XXX,The false accuser of the Hebrew youth;
304,CANTO XXX,"Sinon the other, that false Greek from Troy."
305,CANTO XXX,"Sharp fever drains the reeky moistness out,"
306,CANTO XXX,"In such a cloud upsteam'd.""  When that he heard,"
307,CANTO XXX,"One, gall'd perchance to be so darkly nam'd,"
308,CANTO XXX,"With clench'd hand smote him on the braced paunch,"
309,CANTO XXX,That like a drum resounded: but forthwith
310,CANTO XXX,"Adamo smote him on the face, the blow"
311,CANTO XXX,"Returning with his arm, that seem'd as hard."
312,CANTO XXX,
313,CANTO XXX,"""Though my o'erweighty limbs have ta'en from me"
314,CANTO XXX,"The power to move,"" said he, ""I have an arm"
315,CANTO XXX,"At liberty for such employ.""  To whom"
316,CANTO XXX,"Was answer'd: ""When thou wentest to the fire,"
317,CANTO XXX,"Thou hadst it not so ready at command,"
318,CANTO XXX,"Then readier when it coin'd th' impostor gold."""
319,CANTO XXX,
320,CANTO XXX,"And thus the dropsied: ""Ay, now speak'st thou true."
321,CANTO XXX,"But there thou gav'st not such true testimony,"
322,CANTO XXX,"When thou wast question'd of the truth, at Troy."""
323,CANTO XXX,
324,CANTO XXX,"""If I spake false, thou falsely stamp'dst the coin,"""
325,CANTO XXX,"Said Sinon; ""I am here but for one fault,"
326,CANTO XXX,"And thou for more than any imp beside."""
327,CANTO XXX,
328,CANTO XXX,"""Remember,"" he replied, ""O perjur'd one,"
329,CANTO XXX,"The horse remember, that did teem with death,"
330,CANTO XXX,"And all the world be witness to thy guilt."""
331,CANTO XXX,
332,CANTO XXX,"""To thine,"" return'd the Greek, ""witness the thirst"
333,CANTO XXX,"Whence thy tongue cracks, witness the fluid mound,"
334,CANTO XXX,"Rear'd by thy belly up before thine eyes,"
335,CANTO XXX,"A mass corrupt.""  To whom the coiner thus:"
336,CANTO XXX,"""Thy mouth gapes wide as ever to let pass"
337,CANTO XXX,"Its evil saying.  Me if thirst assails,"
338,CANTO XXX,"Yet I am stuff'd with moisture.  Thou art parch'd,"
339,CANTO XXX,"Pains rack thy head, no urging would'st thou need"
340,CANTO XXX,"To make thee lap Narcissus' mirror up."""
341,CANTO XXX,
342,CANTO XXX,"I was all fix'd to listen, when my guide"
343,CANTO XXX,"Admonish'd: ""Now beware: a little more."
344,CANTO XXX,"And I do quarrel with thee.""  I perceiv'd"
345,CANTO XXX,"How angrily he spake, and towards him turn'd"
346,CANTO XXX,"With shame so poignant, as remember'd yet"
347,CANTO XXX,Confounds me.  As a man that dreams of harm
348,CANTO XXX,"Befall'n him, dreaming wishes it a dream,"
349,CANTO XXX,"And that which is, desires as if it were not,"
350,CANTO XXX,"Such then was I, who wanting power to speak"
351,CANTO XXX,"Wish'd to excuse myself, and all the while"
352,CANTO XXX,"Excus'd me, though unweeting that I did."
353,CANTO XXX,
354,CANTO XXX,"""More grievous fault than thine has been, less shame,"""
355,CANTO XXX,"My master cried, ""might expiate.  Therefore cast"
356,CANTO XXX,All sorrow from thy soul; and if again
357,CANTO XXX,"Chance bring thee, where like conference is held,"
358,CANTO XXX,Think I am ever at thy side.  To hear
359,CANTO XXX,"Such wrangling is a joy for vulgar minds."""
360,CANTO XXX,
361,CANTO XXX,
362,CANTO XXX,
363,CANTO XXX,
364,CANTO XXXI,CANTO XXXI
365,CANTO XXXI,
366,CANTO XXXI,"THE very tongue, whose keen reproof before"
367,CANTO XXXI,"Had wounded me, that either cheek was stain'd,"
368,CANTO XXXI,"Now minister'd my cure.  So have I heard,"
369,CANTO XXXI,Achilles and his father's javelin caus'd
370,CANTO XXXI,"Pain first, and then the boon of health restor'd."
371,CANTO XXXI,
372,CANTO XXXI,"Turning our back upon the vale of woe,"
373,CANTO XXXI,W cross'd th' encircled mound in silence.  There
374,CANTO XXXI,"Was twilight dim, that far long the gloom"
375,CANTO XXXI,Mine eye advanc'd not: but I heard a horn
376,CANTO XXXI,Sounded aloud. The peal it blew had made
377,CANTO XXXI,The thunder feeble.  Following its course
378,CANTO XXXI,"The adverse way, my strained eyes were bent"
379,CANTO XXXI,On that one spot.  So terrible a blast
380,CANTO XXXI,"Orlando blew not, when that dismal rout"
381,CANTO XXXI,"O'erthrew the host of Charlemagne, and quench'd"
382,CANTO XXXI,His saintly warfare.  Thitherward not long
383,CANTO XXXI,"My head was rais'd, when many lofty towers"
384,CANTO XXXI,"Methought I spied.  ""Master,"" said I, ""what land"
385,CANTO XXXI,"Is this?""  He answer'd straight: ""Too long a space"
386,CANTO XXXI,Of intervening darkness has thine eye
387,CANTO XXXI,To traverse: thou hast therefore widely err'd
388,CANTO XXXI,In thy imagining.  Thither arriv'd
389,CANTO XXXI,"Thou well shalt see, how distance can delude"
390,CANTO XXXI,"The sense.  A little therefore urge thee on."""
391,CANTO XXXI,
392,CANTO XXXI,Then tenderly he caught me by the hand;
393,CANTO XXXI,"""Yet know,"" said he, ""ere farther we advance,"
394,CANTO XXXI,"That it less strange may seem, these are not towers,"
395,CANTO XXXI,"But giants.  In the pit they stand immers'd,"
396,CANTO XXXI,"Each from his navel downward, round the bank."""
397,CANTO XXXI,
398,CANTO XXXI,"As when a fog disperseth gradually,"
399,CANTO XXXI,Our vision traces what the mist involves
400,CANTO XXXI,Condens'd in air; so piercing through the gross
401,CANTO XXXI,"And gloomy atmosphere, as more and more"
402,CANTO XXXI,"We near'd toward the brink, mine error fled,"
403,CANTO XXXI,And fear came o'er me.  As with circling round
404,CANTO XXXI,"Of turrets, Montereggion crowns his walls,"
405,CANTO XXXI,"E'en thus the shore, encompassing th' abyss,"
406,CANTO XXXI,"Was turreted with giants, half their length"
407,CANTO XXXI,"Uprearing, horrible, whom Jove from heav'n"
408,CANTO XXXI,"Yet threatens, when his mutt'ring thunder rolls."
409,CANTO XXXI,
410,CANTO XXXI,"Of one already I descried the face,"
411,CANTO XXXI,"Shoulders, and breast, and of the belly huge"
412,CANTO XXXI,"Great part, and both arms down along his ribs."
413,CANTO XXXI,
414,CANTO XXXI,"All-teeming nature, when her plastic hand"
415,CANTO XXXI,"Left framing of these monsters, did display"
416,CANTO XXXI,"Past doubt her wisdom, taking from mad War"
417,CANTO XXXI,Such slaves to do his bidding; and if she
418,CANTO XXXI,"Repent her not of th' elephant and whale,"
419,CANTO XXXI,Who ponders well confesses her therein
420,CANTO XXXI,Wiser and more discreet; for when brute force
421,CANTO XXXI,"And evil will are back'd with subtlety,"
422,CANTO XXXI,Resistance none avails.  His visage seem'd
423,CANTO XXXI,"In length and bulk, as doth the pine, that tops"
424,CANTO XXXI,Saint Peter's Roman fane; and th' other bones
425,CANTO XXXI,"Of like proportion, so that from above"
426,CANTO XXXI,"The bank, which girdled him below, such height"
427,CANTO XXXI,"Arose his stature, that three Friezelanders"
428,CANTO XXXI,Had striv'n in vain to reach but to his hair.
429,CANTO XXXI,Full thirty ample palms was he expos'd
430,CANTO XXXI,Downward from whence a man his garments loops.
431,CANTO XXXI,"""Raphel bai ameth sabi almi,"""
432,CANTO XXXI,"So shouted his fierce lips, which sweeter hymns"
433,CANTO XXXI,Became not; and my guide address'd him thus:
434,CANTO XXXI,
435,CANTO XXXI,"""O senseless spirit! let thy horn for thee"
436,CANTO XXXI,"Interpret: therewith vent thy rage, if rage"
437,CANTO XXXI,"Or other passion wring thee.  Search thy neck,"
438,CANTO XXXI,There shalt thou find the belt that binds it on.
439,CANTO XXXI,"Wild spirit! lo, upon thy mighty breast"
440,CANTO XXXI,"Where hangs the baldrick!""  Then to me he spake:"
441,CANTO XXXI,"""He doth accuse himself.  Nimrod is this,"
442,CANTO XXXI,Through whose ill counsel in the world no more
443,CANTO XXXI,"One tongue prevails.  But pass we on, nor waste"
444,CANTO XXXI,"Our words; for so each language is to him,"
445,CANTO XXXI,"As his to others, understood by none."""
446,CANTO XXXI,
447,CANTO XXXI,"Then to the leftward turning sped we forth,"
448,CANTO XXXI,And at a sling's throw found another shade
449,CANTO XXXI,Far fiercer and more huge.  I cannot say
450,CANTO XXXI,What master hand had girt him; but he held
451,CANTO XXXI,"Behind the right arm fetter'd, and before"
452,CANTO XXXI,"The other with a chain, that fasten'd him"
453,CANTO XXXI,"From the neck down, and five times round his form"
454,CANTO XXXI,"Apparent met the wreathed links.  ""This proud one"
455,CANTO XXXI,Would of his strength against almighty Jove
456,CANTO XXXI,"Make trial,"" said my guide; ""whence he is thus"
457,CANTO XXXI,Requited: Ephialtes him they call.
458,CANTO XXXI,
459,CANTO XXXI,"""Great was his prowess, when the giants brought"
460,CANTO XXXI,"Fear on the gods: those arms, which then he piled,"
461,CANTO XXXI,"Now moves he never.""  Forthwith I return'd:"
462,CANTO XXXI,"""Fain would I, if 't were possible, mine eyes"
463,CANTO XXXI,Of Briareus immeasurable gain'd
464,CANTO XXXI,"Experience next.""  He answer'd: ""Thou shalt see"
465,CANTO XXXI,"Not far from hence Antaeus, who both speaks"
466,CANTO XXXI,"And is unfetter'd, who shall place us there"
467,CANTO XXXI,Where guilt is at its depth.  Far onward stands
468,CANTO XXXI,"Whom thou wouldst fain behold, in chains, and made"
469,CANTO XXXI,"Like to this spirit, save that in his looks"
470,CANTO XXXI,"More fell he seems.""  By violent earthquake rock'd"
471,CANTO XXXI,"Ne'er shook a tow'r, so reeling to its base,"
472,CANTO XXXI,As Ephialtes.  More than ever then
473,CANTO XXXI,"I dreaded death, nor than the terror more"
474,CANTO XXXI,"Had needed, if I had not seen the cords"
475,CANTO XXXI,"That held him fast.  We, straightway journeying on,"
476,CANTO XXXI,"Came to Antaeus, who five ells complete"
477,CANTO XXXI,"Without the head, forth issued from the cave."
478,CANTO XXXI,
479,CANTO XXXI,"""O thou, who in the fortunate vale, that made"
480,CANTO XXXI,"Great Scipio heir of glory, when his sword"
481,CANTO XXXI,"Drove back the troop of Hannibal in flight,"
482,CANTO XXXI,Who thence of old didst carry for thy spoil
483,CANTO XXXI,An hundred lions; and if thou hadst fought
484,CANTO XXXI,"In the high conflict on thy brethren's side,"
485,CANTO XXXI,"Seems as men yet believ'd, that through thine arm"
486,CANTO XXXI,"The sons of earth had conquer'd, now vouchsafe"
487,CANTO XXXI,"To place us down beneath, where numbing cold"
488,CANTO XXXI,Locks up Cocytus.  Force not that we crave
489,CANTO XXXI,Or Tityus' help or Typhon's.  Here is one
490,CANTO XXXI,Can give what in this realm ye covet.  Stoop
491,CANTO XXXI,"Therefore, nor scornfully distort thy lip."
492,CANTO XXXI,He in the upper world can yet bestow
493,CANTO XXXI,"Renown on thee, for he doth live, and looks"
494,CANTO XXXI,"For life yet longer, if before the time"
495,CANTO XXXI,"Grace call him not unto herself.""  Thus spake"
496,CANTO XXXI,"The teacher.  He in haste forth stretch'd his hands,"
497,CANTO XXXI,And caught my guide.  Alcides whilom felt
498,CANTO XXXI,That grapple straighten'd score.  Soon as my guide
499,CANTO XXXI,"Had felt it, he bespake me thus: ""This way"
500,CANTO XXXI,"That I may clasp thee;"" then so caught me up,"
501,CANTO XXXI,That we were both one burden.  As appears
502,CANTO XXXI,"The tower of Carisenda, from beneath"
503,CANTO XXXI,"Where it doth lean, if chance a passing cloud"
504,CANTO XXXI,"So sail across, that opposite it hangs,"
505,CANTO XXXI,"Such then Antaeus seem'd, as at mine ease"
506,CANTO XXXI,I mark'd him stooping.  I were fain at times
507,CANTO XXXI,"T' have pass'd another way.  Yet in th' abyss,"
508,CANTO XXXI,"That Lucifer with Judas low ingulfs,"
509,CANTO XXXI,"Lightly he plac'd us; nor there leaning stay'd,"
510,CANTO XXXI,But rose as in a bark the stately mast.
