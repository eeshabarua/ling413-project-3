62,PREFACE.,
63,PREFACE.,
64,PREFACE.,A Translator who has never felt his self-imposed task to be a light one
65,PREFACE.,may be excused from entering into explanations that would but too
66,PREFACE.,naturally take the form of apologies. I will only say that while I have
67,PREFACE.,striven to be as faithful as I could to the words as well as to the
68,PREFACE.,"sense of my author, the following translation is not offered as being"
69,PREFACE.,always closely literal. The kind of verse employed I believe to be that
70,PREFACE.,"best fitted to give some idea, however faint, of the rigidly measured"
71,PREFACE.,and yet easy strength of Dante's _terza rima_; but whoever chooses to
72,PREFACE.,adopt it with its constantly recurring demand for rhymes necessarily
73,PREFACE.,becomes in some degree its servant. Such students as wish to follow the
74,PREFACE.,poet word by word will always find what they need in Dr. J. A. Carlyle's
75,PREFACE.,"excellent prose version of the _Inferno_, a work to which I have to"
76,PREFACE.,acknowledge my own indebtedness at many points.
77,PREFACE.,
78,PREFACE.,"The matter of the notes, it is needless to say, has been in very great"
79,PREFACE.,part found ready to my hand in existing Commentaries. My edition of John
80,PREFACE.,"Villani is that of Florence, 1823."
81,PREFACE.,
82,PREFACE.,The Note at page cx was printed before it had been resolved to provide
83,PREFACE.,the volume with a copy of Giotto's portrait of Dante. I have to thank
84,PREFACE.,the Council of the Arundel Society for their kind permission to Messrs.
85,PREFACE.,Dawson to make use of their lithograph of Mr. Seymour Kirkup's
86,PREFACE.,invaluable sketch in the production of the Frontispiece--a privilege
87,PREFACE.,that would have been taken more advantage of had it not been deemed
88,PREFACE.,"advisable to work chiefly from the photograph of the same sketch, given"
89,PREFACE.,in the third volume of the late Lord Vernon's sumptuous and rare edition
90,PREFACE.,"of the _Inferno_ (Florence, 1865). In this Vernon photograph, as well as"
91,PREFACE.,"in the Arundel Society's chromolithograph, the disfiguring mark on the"
92,PREFACE.,face caused by the damage to the plaster of the fresco is faithfully
93,PREFACE.,reproduced. A less degree of fidelity has been observed in the
94,PREFACE.,Frontispiece; although the restoration has not been carried the length
95,PREFACE.,of replacing the lost eye.

338,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,
339,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"Dante is himself the hero of the _Divine Comedy_, and ere many stages of"
340,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,the _Inferno_ have been passed the reader feels that all his steps are
341,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,being taken in a familiar companionship. When every allowance has been
342,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,made for what the exigencies of art required him to heighten or
343,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"suppress, it is still impossible not to be convinced that the author is"
344,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,revealing himself much as he really was--in some of his weakness as well
345,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"as in all his strength. The poem itself, by many an unconscious touch,"
346,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,does for his moral portraiture what the pencil of Giotto has done for
347,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,the features of his face. The one likeness answers marvellously to the
348,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"other; and, together, they have helped the world to recognise in him the"
349,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"great example of a man of genius who, though at first sight he may seem"
350,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"to be austere, is soon found to attract our love by the depth of his"
351,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"feelings as much as he wins our admiration by the wealth of his fancy,"
352,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,and by the clearness of his judgment on everything concerned with the
353,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,lives and destiny of men. His other writings in greater or less degree
354,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,confirm the impression of Dante's character to be obtained from the
355,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"_Comedy_. Some of them are partly autobiographical; and, studying as a"
356,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"whole all that is left to us of him, we can gain a general notion of"
357,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,the nature of his career--when he was born and what was his condition in
358,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"life; his early loves and friendships; his studies, military service,"
359,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"and political aims; his hopes and illusions, and the weary purgatory of"
360,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,his exile.
361,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,
362,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,To the knowledge of Dante's life and character which is thus to be
363,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"acquired, the formal biographies of him have but little to add that is"
364,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,both trustworthy and of value. Something of course there is in the
365,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,traditional story of his life that has come down from his time with the
366,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,seal of genuineness; and something that has been ascertained by careful
367,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,research among Florentine and other documents. But when all that old and
368,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"modern _Lives_ have to tell us has been sifted, the additional facts"
369,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,regarding him are found to be but few; such at least as are beyond
370,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"dispute. Boccaccio, his earliest biographer, swells out his _Life_, as"
371,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"the earlier commentators on the _Comedy_ do their notes, with what are"
372,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,plainly but legendary amplifications of hints supplied by Dante's own
373,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,words; while more recent and critical writers succeed with infinite
374,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"pains in little beyond establishing, each to his own satisfaction, what"
375,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"was the order of publication of the poet's works, where he may have"
376,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"travelled to, and when and for how long a time he may have had this or"
377,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,that great lord for a patron.
378,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,
379,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,A very few pages would therefore be enough to tell the events of Dante's
380,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"life as far as they are certainly known. But, to be of use as an"
381,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"introduction to the study of his great poem, any biographical sketch"
382,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,must contain some account--more or less full--of Florentine affairs
383,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,before and during his lifetime; for among the actors in these are to be
384,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,found many of the persons of the _Comedy_. In reading the poem we are
385,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,never suffered for long to forget his exile. From one point of view it
386,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,is an appeal to future ages from Florentine injustice and ingratitude;
387,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"from another, it is a long and passionate plea with his native town to"
388,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,shake her in her stubborn cruelty. In spite of the worst she can do
389,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"against him he remains no less her son. In the early copies of it, the"
390,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"_Comedy_ is well described as the work of Dante Alighieri, the"
391,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,Florentine; since not only does he people the other world by preference
392,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"with Florentines, but it is to Florence that, even when his words are"
393,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"bitter against her, his heart is always feeling back. Among the glories"
394,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,of Paradise he loves to let his memory rest on the church in which he
395,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,was baptized and the streets he used to tread. He takes pleasure in her
396,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,stones; and with her towers and palaces Florence stands for the
397,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,unchanging background to the changing scenes of his mystical pilgrimage.
398,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,
399,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,The history of Florence during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries
400,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,agrees in general outline with that of most of its neighbours. At the
401,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"beginning of the period it was a place of but little importance, ranking"
402,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,far below Pisa both in wealth and political influence. Though retaining
403,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"the names and forms of municipal government, inherited from early times,"
404,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,it was in reality possessed of no effective control over its own
405,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"affairs, and was subject to its feudal superior almost as completely as"
406,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,was ever any German village planted in the shadow of a castle. To
407,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"Florence, as to many a city of Northern and Central Italy, the first"
408,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,opportunity of winning freedom came with the contest between Emperor
409,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,and Pope in the time of Hildebrand. In this quarrel the Church found its
410,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"best ally in Matilda, Countess of Tuscany. She, to secure the goodwill"
411,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"of her subjects as against the Emperor, yielded first one and then"
412,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"another of her rights in Florence, generally by way of a pious gift--an"
413,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,endowment for a religious house or an increase of jurisdiction to the
414,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"bishop--these concessions, however veiled, being in effect so many"
415,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,additions to the resources and liberties of the townsmen. She made Rome
416,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"her heir, and then Florence was able to play off the Papal against the"
417,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"Imperial claims, yielding a kind of barren homage to both Emperor and"
418,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"Pope, and only studious to complete a virtual independence of both."
419,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"Florence had been Matilda's favourite place of residence; and,"
420,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"benefiting largely as it did by her easy rule, it is no wonder that her"
421,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,name should have been cherished by the Florentines for ages after as a
422,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,household word.[1] Nor is the greatest Florentine unmindful of her. Foe
423,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"of the Empire though she was, he only remembers her piety; and it is by"
424,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"Matilda, as representing the active religious life, that Dante is"
425,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,ushered into the presence of Beatrice in the Earthly Paradise.[2]
426,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,
427,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,It was a true instinct which led Florence and other cities to side
428,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,rather with the Pope than with the Emperor in the long-continued
429,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,struggle between them for predominance in Italy. With the Pope for
430,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"overlord they would at least have a master who was an Italian, and one"
431,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"who, his title being imperfect, would in his own interest be led to"
432,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"treat them with indulgence; while, in the permanent triumph of the"
433,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"Emperor, Italy must have become subject and tributary to Germany, and"
434,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,would have seen new estates carved out of her fertile soil for members
435,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,of the German garrison. The danger was brought home to many of the
436,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,youthful commonwealths during the eventful reign of Frederick Barbarossa
437,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"(1152-1190). Strong in Germany beyond most of his predecessors, that"
438,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"monarch ascended the throne with high prerogative views, in which he was"
439,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,confirmed by the slavish doctrine of some of the new civilians.
440,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,According to these there could be only one master in the world; as far
441,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"as regarded the things of time, but one source of authority in"
442,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,Christendom. They maintained everything to be the Emperor's that he
443,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"chose to take. When he descended into Italy to enforce his claims, the"
444,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"cities of the Lombard League met him in open battle. Those of Tuscany,"
445,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"and especially Florence, bent before the blast, temporising as long as"
446,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"they were able, and making the best terms they could when the choice lay"
447,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"between submission and open revolt. Even Florence, it is true, strong in"
448,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"her allies, did once take arms against an Imperial lieutenant; but as a"
449,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"rule she never refused obedience in words, and never yielded it in fact"
450,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"beyond what could not be helped. In her pursuit of advantages,"
451,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"skilfully using every opportunity, and steadfast of aim even when most"
452,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"she appeared to waver, she displayed something of the same address that"
453,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,was long to be noted as a trait in the character of the individual
454,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,Florentine.
455,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,
456,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"The storm was weathered, although not wholly without loss. When, towards"
457,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"the close of his life, and after he had broken his strength against the"
458,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"obstinate patriotism of Lombardy, Frederick visited Florence in 1185, it"
459,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"was as a master justly displeased with servants who, while they had not"
460,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"openly rebelled against him, had yet proved eminently unprofitable, and"
461,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,whom he was concerned to punish if not to destroy. On the complaint of
462,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"the neighbouring nobles, that they were oppressed and had been plundered"
463,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"by the city, he gave orders for the restoration to them of their lands"
464,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"and castles. This accomplished, all the territory left to Florence was a"
465,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,narrow belt around the walls. Villani even says that for the four years
466,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,during which Frederick still lived the Commonwealth was wholly landless.
467,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"And here, rather than lose ourselves among the endless treaties,"
468,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"leagues, and campaigns which fill so many pages of the chronicles, it"
469,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,may be worth while shortly to glance at the constitution of Florentine
470,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"society, and especially at the place held in it by the class which found"
471,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,its protector in Barbarossa.
472,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,
473,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,Much about the time at which the Commonwealth was relieved of its feudal
474,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"trammels, as a result of the favour or the necessities of Matilda, it"
475,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,was beginning to extend its commerce and increase its industry. Starting
476,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"somewhat late on the career on which Venice, Genoa, and Pisa were"
477,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"already far advanced, Florence was as if strenuous to make up for lost"
478,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"time, and soon displayed a rare comprehension of the nature of the"
479,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"enterprise. It may be questioned if ever, until quite modern times,"
480,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,there has been anywhere so clear an understanding of the truth that
481,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"public wellbeing is the sum of private prosperity, or such an"
482,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,enlightened perception of what tends to economical progress. Florence
483,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"had no special command of raw material for her manufactures, no sea-port"
484,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"of her own, and no monopoly unless in the natural genius of her people."
485,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,She could therefore thrive only by dint of holding open her
486,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"communications with the world at large, and grudged no pains either of"
487,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,war or diplomacy to keep at Pisa a free way out and in for her
488,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,merchandise. Already in the twelfth century she received through that
489,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"port the rough woollens of Flanders, which, after being skilfully"
490,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"dressed and dyed, were sent out at great profit to every market of"
491,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,Europe. At a somewhat later period the Florentines were to give as
492,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,strong a proof of their financial capacity as this was of their
493,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,industrial. It was they who first conducted a large business in bills of
494,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"exchange, and who first struck a gold coin which, being kept of"
495,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"invariable purity, passed current in every land where men bought and"
496,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,sold--even in countries where the very name of Florence was unknown.[3]
497,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,
498,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"In a community thus devoted to industry and commerce, it was natural"
499,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,that a great place should be filled by merchants. These were divided
500,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"into six guilds, the members of which, with the notaries and lawyers,"
501,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"who composed a seventh, formed the true body of the citizens."
502,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,Originally the consuls of these guilds were the only elected officials
503,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"in the city, and in the early days of its liberty they were even charged"
504,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"with political duties, and are found, for example, signing a treaty of"
505,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,peace with a neighbouring state. In the fully developed commune it was
506,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"only the wealthier citizens--the members, we may assume, of these"
507,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"guilds--who, along with the nobles,[4] were eligible for and had the"
508,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,right of electing to the public offices. Below them was the great body
509,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"of the people; all, that is, of servile condition or engaged in the"
510,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"meaner kinds of business. From one point of view, the liberties of the"
511,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,citizens were only their privileges. But although the labourers and
512,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"humbler tradesmen were without franchises, their interests were not"
513,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"therefore neglected, being bound up with those of the one or two"
514,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,thousand citizens who shared with the patricians the control of public
515,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,affairs.
516,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,
517,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,There were two classes of nobles with whom Florence had to reckon as she
518,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"awoke to life--those within the walls, and those settled in the"
519,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,neighbouring country. In later times it was a favourite boast among the
520,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,noble citizens--a boast indulged in by Dante--that they were descended
521,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,from ancient Roman settlers on the banks of the Arno. A safer boast
522,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,would in many cases have been that their ancestors had come to Italy in
523,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,the train of Otho and other conquering Emperors. Though settled in the
524,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"city, in some cases for generations, the patrician families were not"
525,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"altogether of it, being distinguished from the other citizens, if not"
526,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"always by the possession of ancestral landward estates, at least by"
527,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,their delight in war and contempt for honest industry. But with the
528,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,faults of a noble class they had many of its good qualities. Of these
529,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"the Republic suffered them to make full proof, allowing them to lead in"
530,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,war and hold civil offices out of all proportion to their numbers.
531,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,
532,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"Like the city itself, the nobles in the country around had been feudally"
533,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,subject to the Marquis of Tuscany. After Matilda's death they claimed to
534,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,hold direct from the Empire; which meant in practice to be above all
535,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,law. They exercised absolute jurisdiction over their serfs and
536,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"dependants, and, when favoured by the situation of their castles, took"
537,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"toll, like the robber barons of Germany, of the goods which passed"
538,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,beneath their walls. Already they had proved to be thorns in the side of
539,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,the industrious burghers; but at the beginning of the twelfth century
540,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"their neighbourhood became intolerable, and for a couple of generations"
541,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,the chief political work of Florence was to bring them to reason. Those
542,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"whose lands came up almost to the city gates were first dealt with, and"
543,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,then in a widening circle the country was cleared of the pest. Year
544,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"after year, when the days were lengthening out in spring, the roughly"
545,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"organised city militia was mustered, war was declared against some"
546,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"specially obnoxious noble and his fortress was taken by surprise, or,"
547,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"failing that, was subjected to a siege. In the absence of a more"
548,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"definite grievance, it was enough to declare his castle dangerously near"
549,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,the city. These expeditions were led by the nobles who were already
550,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"citizens, while the country neighbours of the victim looked on with"
551,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"indifference, or even helped to waste the lands or force the stronghold"
552,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"of a rival. The castle once taken, it was either levelled with the"
553,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"ground, or was restored to the owner on condition of his yielding"
554,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"service to the Republic. And, both by way of securing a hold upon an"
555,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,unwilling vassal and of adding a wealthy house and some strong arms to
556,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"the Commonwealth, he was compelled, along with his family, to reside in"
557,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,Florence for a great part of every year.
558,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,
559,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"With a wider territory and an increasing commerce, it was natural for"
560,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"Florence to assume more and more the attitude of a sovereign state,"
561,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"ready, when need was, to impose its will upon its neighbours, or to join"
562,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,with them for the common defence of Tuscany. In the noble class and its
563,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"retainers, recruited as has been described, it was possessed of a"
564,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"standing army which, whether from love of adventure or greed of plunder,"
565,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,was never so well pleased as when in active employment. Not that the
566,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"commons left the fighting wholly to the men of family, for they too, at"
567,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"the summons of the war-bell, had to arm for the field; but at the best"
568,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"they did it from a sense of duty, and, without the aid of professional"
569,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"men-at-arms, they must have failed more frequently in their enterprises,"
570,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,or at any rate have had to endure a greatly prolonged absence from their
571,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"counters and workshops. And yet, esteem this advantage as highly as we"
572,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"will, Florence surely lost more than it gained by compelling the crowd"
573,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,of idle gentlemen to come within its walls. In the course of time some
574,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"of them indeed condescended to engage in trade--sank, as the phrase"
575,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"went, into the ranks of the _Popolani_, or mere wealthy citizens; but"
576,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"the great body of them, while their landed property was being largely"
577,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"increased in value in consequence of the general prosperity, held"
578,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,themselves haughtily aloof from honest industry in every form. Each
579,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"family, or rather each clan of them, lived apart in its own group of"
580,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"houses, from among which towers shot aloft for scores of yards into the"
581,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"air, dominating the humbler dwellings of the common burghers. These,"
582,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"whenever they came to the front for a time in the government, were used"
583,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,to decree that all private towers were to be lopped down to within a
584,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,certain distance from the ground.
585,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,
586,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,It is a favourite exercise of Villani and other historians to trace the
587,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,troubles and revolutions in the state of Florence to chance quarrels
588,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"between noble families, arising from an angry word or a broken troth."
589,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"Here, they tell, was sown the seed of the Guelf and Ghibeline wars in"
590,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,Florence; and here that of the feuds of Black and White. Such quarrels
591,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,and party names were symptoms and nothing more. The enduring source of
592,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"trouble was the presence within the city of a powerful idle class,"
593,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"constantly eager to recover the privilege it had lost, and to secure"
594,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"itself by every available means, including that of outside help, in the"
595,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,possession of what it still retained; which chafed against the curbs put
596,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"upon its lawlessness, and whose ambitions were all opposed to the"
597,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"general interest. The citizens, for their part, had nothing better to"
598,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"hope for than that Italy should be left to the Italians, Florence to the"
599,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"Florentines. On the occasion of the celebrated Buondelmonti feud (1215),"
600,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"some of the nobles definitely went over to the side of the people,"
601,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"either because they judged it likely to win in the long-run, or"
602,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,impelled unconsciously by the forces that in every society divide
603,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"ambitious men into two camps, and in one form or another develop party"
604,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,strife. They who made a profession of popular sympathy did it with a
605,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,view of using rather than of helping the people at large. Both of the
606,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,noble parties held the same end in sight--control of the Commonwealth;
607,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,and this would be worth the more the fewer there were to share it. The
608,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,faction irreconcilable with the Republic on any terms included many of
609,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,the oldest and proudest houses. Their hope lay in the advent of a strong
610,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,"Emperor, who should depute to them his rights over the money-getting,"
611,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,low-born crowd.
612,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,
613,FLORENCE AND DANTE.,
614,II.,II.
615,II.,
616,II.,The opportunity of this class might seem to have come when the
617,II.,"Hohenstaufen Frederick II., grandson of Barbarossa, ascended the throne,"
618,II.,"and still more when, on attaining full age, he claimed the whole of the"
619,II.,Peninsula as his family inheritance. Other Emperors had withstood the
620,II.,"Papal claims, but none had ever proved an antagonist like Frederick. His"
621,II.,"quarrel seemed indeed to be with the Church itself, with its doctrines"
622,II.,and morals as well as with the ambition of churchmen; and he offered the
623,II.,strange spectacle of a Roman Emperor--one of the twin lights in the
624,II.,Christian firmament--whose favour was less easily won by Christian
625,II.,"piety, however eminent, than by the learning of the Arab or the Jew."
626,II.,When compelled at last to fulfil a promise extorted from him of
627,II.,"conducting a crusade to the Holy Land, he scandalised Christendom by"
628,II.,"making friends of the Sultan, and by using his presence in the East, not"
629,II.,"for the deliverance of the Sepulchre, but for the furtherance of"
630,II.,"learning and commerce. Thrice excommunicated, he had his revenge by"
631,II.,proving with how little concern the heaviest anathemas of the Church
632,II.,"could be met by one who was armed in unbelief. Literature, art, and"
633,II.,"manners were sedulously cultivated in his Sicilian court, and among the"
634,II.,"able ministers whom he selected or formed, the modern idea of the State"
635,II.,"may be said to have had its birth. Free thinker and free liver, poet,"
636,II.,"warrior, and statesman, he stood forward against the sombre background"
637,II.,of the Middle Ages a figure in every respect so brilliant and original
638,II.,as well to earn from his contemporaries the title of the Wonder of the
639,II.,World.
640,II.,
641,II.,On the goodwill of Italians Frederick had the claim of being the most
642,II.,"Italian of all the Emperors since the revival of the Western Empire, and"
643,II.,the only one of them whose throne was permanently set on Italian soil.
644,II.,Yet he never won the popular heart. To the common mind he always
645,II.,appeared as something outlandish and terrible--as the man who had driven
646,II.,"a profitable but impious trade in the Sultan's land. Dante, in his"
647,II.,"childhood, must have heard many a tale of him; and we find him keenly"
648,II.,interested in the character of the Emperor who came nearest to uniting
649,II.,"Italy into a great nation, in whose court there had been a welcome for"
650,II.,"every man of intellect, and in whom a great original poet would have"
651,II.,"found a willing and munificent patron. In the _Inferno_, by the mouth of"
652,II.,"Pier delle Vigne, the Imperial Chancellor, he pronounces Frederick to"
653,II.,have been worthy of all honour;[5] yet justice requires him to lodge
654,II.,"this flower of kings in the burning tomb of the Epicureans, as having"
655,II.,been guilty of the arch-heresy of denying the moral government of the
656,II.,"world, and holding that with the death of the body all is ended.[6] It"
657,II.,"was a heresy fostered by the lives of many churchmen, high and low; but"
658,II.,the example of Frederick encouraged the profession of it by nobles and
659,II.,learned laymen. On Frederick's character there was a still darker stain
660,II.,than this of religious indifference--that of cold-blooded cruelty. Even
661,II.,"in an age which had produced Ezzelino Romano, the Emperor's cloaks of"
662,II.,"lead were renowned as the highest refinement in torture.[7] But, with"
663,II.,"all his genius, and his want of scruple in the choice of means, he built"
664,II.,nothing politically that was not ere his death crumbling to dust. His
665,II.,enduring work was that of an intellectual reformer under whose
666,II.,"protection and with whose personal help his native language was refined,"
667,II.,"Europe was enriched with a learning new to it or long forgotten, and the"
668,II.,"minds of men, as they lost their blind reverence for Rome, were prepared"
669,II.,for a freer treatment of all the questions with which religion deals. He
670,II.,was thus in some respects a precursor of Dante.
671,II.,
672,II.,More than once in the course of Frederick's career it seemed as if he
673,II.,"might become master of Tuscany in fact as well as in name, had Florence"
674,II.,"only been as well affected to him as were Siena and Pisa. But already,"
675,II.,"as has been said, the popular interest had been strengthened by"
676,II.,"accessions from among the nobles. Others of them, without descending"
677,II.,"into the ranks of the citizens, had set their hopes on being the first"
678,II.,in a commonwealth rather than privates in the Imperial garrison. These
679,II.,"men, with their restless and narrow ambitions, were as dangerous to have"
680,II.,"for allies as for foes, but by throwing their weight into the popular"
681,II.,"scale they at least served to hold the Imperialist magnates in check,"
682,II.,and established something like a balance in the fighting power of
683,II.,"Florence; and so, as in the days of Barbarossa, the city was preserved"
684,II.,from taking a side too strongly. The hearts of the Florentine traders
685,II.,were in their own affairs--in extending their commerce and increasing
686,II.,their territory and influence in landward Tuscany. As regarded the
687,II.,"general politics of Italy, their sympathy was still with the Roman See;"
688,II.,but it was a sympathy without devotion or gratitude. For refusing to
689,II.,join in the crusade of 1238 the town was placed under interdict by
690,II.,Gregory IX. The Emperor meanwhile was acknowledged as its lawful
691,II.,"overlord, and his vicar received something more than nominal obedience,"
692,II.,the choice of the chief magistrates being made subject to his approval.
693,II.,"Yet with all this, and although his party was powerful in the city, it"
694,II.,was but a grudging service that was yielded to Frederick. More than once
695,II.,fines were levied on the Florentines; and worse punishments were
696,II.,"threatened for their persevering and active enmity to Siena, now"
697,II.,dominated by its nobles and held in the Imperial interest. Volunteers
698,II.,from Florence might join the Emperor in his Lombard campaigns; but they
699,II.,were left equally free by the Commonwealth to join the other side. At
700,II.,"last, when he was growing old, and when like his grandfather he had been"
701,II.,"foiled by the stubborn Lombards, he turned on the Florentines as an"
702,II.,"easier prey, and sent word to the nobles of his party to seize the city."
703,II.,"For months the streets were filled with battle. In January 1248,"
704,II.,"Frederick of Antioch, the natural son of the Emperor, entered Florence"
705,II.,"with some squadrons of men-at-arms, and a few days later the nobles that"
706,II.,had fought on the popular side were driven into banishment. This is
707,II.,known in the Florentine annals as the first dispersion of the Guelfs.
708,II.,
709,II.,"Long before they were adopted in Italy, the names of Guelf and Ghibeline"
710,II.,had been employed in Germany to mark the partisans of the Bavarian Welf
711,II.,and of the Hohenstaufen lords of Waiblingen. On Italian soil they
712,II.,received an extended meaning: Ghibeline stood for Imperialist; Guelf for
713,II.,"anti-Imperialist, Papalist, or simply Nationalist. When the names began"
714,II.,"to be freely used in Florence, which was towards the close of"
715,II.,"Frederick's reign and about a century after their first invention, they"
716,II.,"denoted no new start in politics, but only supplied a nomenclature for"
717,II.,"parties already in existence. As far as Florence was concerned, the"
718,II.,designations were the more convenient that they were not too closely
719,II.,"descriptive. The Ghibeline was the Emperor's man, when it served his"
720,II.,"purpose to be so; while the Guelf, constant only in his enmity to the"
721,II.,"Ghibelines, was free to think of the Pope as he chose, and to serve him"
722,II.,"no more than he wished or needed to. Ultimately, indeed, all Florence"
723,II.,"may be said to have become Guelf. To begin with, the name distinguished"
724,II.,"the nobles who sought alliance with the citizens, from the nobles who"
725,II.,looked on these as they might have done on serfs newly thriven into
726,II.,wealth. Each party was to come up in turn. Within a period of twenty
727,II.,"years each was twice driven into banishment, a measure always"
728,II.,accompanied with decrees of confiscation and the levelling of private
729,II.,"strongholds in Florence. The exiles kept well together, retreating, as"
730,II.,"it were in the order of war, to camps of observation they found ready"
731,II.,prepared for them in the nearest cities and fortresses held by those of
732,II.,"their own way of thinking. All their wits were then bent on how, by dint"
733,II.,"of some fighting and much diplomacy, they might shake the strength and"
734,II.,"undermine the credit of their successful rivals in the city, and secure"
735,II.,their own return in triumph. It was an art they were proud to be adepts
736,II.,in.[8]
737,II.,
738,II.,In a rapid sketch like this it would be impossible to tell half the
739,II.,changes made on the constitution of Florence during the second part of
740,II.,the thirteenth century. Dante in a well-known passage reproaches
741,II.,Florence with the political restlessness which afflicted her like a
742,II.,"disease. Laws, he says, made in October were fallen into desuetude ere"
743,II.,mid-November.[9] And yet it may be that in this constant readiness to
744,II.,"change, lies the best proof of the political capacity of the"
745,II.,Florentines. It was to meet new necessities that they made provision of
746,II.,new laws. Especial watchfulness was called for against the encroachments
747,II.,"of the grandees, whose constant tendency--whatever their party"
748,II.,"name--was to weaken legal authority, and play the part of lords and"
749,II.,masters of the citizens. But these were no mere weavers and
750,II.,quill-drivers to be plundered at will. Even before the return of the
751,II.,"Guelfs, banished in 1248, the citizens, taking advantage of a check"
752,II.,"suffered in the field by the dominant Ghibelines, had begun to recast"
753,II.,"the constitution in a popular sense, and to organise the townsmen as a"
754,II.,"militia on a permanent footing. When, on the death of Frederick in 1250,"
755,II.,"the Imperialist nobles were left without foreign aid, there began a"
756,II.,"period of ten years, favourably known in Florentine history as the"
757,II.,"Government of the _Primo Popolo_ or _Popolo Vecchio_; that is, of the"
758,II.,"true body of the citizens, commoners possessed of franchises, as"
759,II.,distinguished from the nobles above them and the multitude below. For it
760,II.,"is never to be forgotten that Florence, like Athens, and like the other"
761,II.,"Italian Republics, was far from being a true democracy. The time was yet"
762,II.,"to come, and it was not far distant, when the ranks of citizenship were"
763,II.,"to be more widely opened than now to those below, and more closely shut"
764,II.,to those above. In the meantime the comparatively small number of
765,II.,wealthy citizens who legally composed the 'People' made good use of
766,II.,"their ten years of breathing-time, entering on commercial treaties and"
767,II.,"widening the possessions of the Commonwealth, now by war, and now by"
768,II.,shrewd bargains with great barons. To balance the influence of the
769,II.,"Podesta, who had hitherto been the one great officer of State--criminal"
770,II.,"judge, civil governor, and commander-in-chief all in one--they created"
771,II.,the office of Captain of the People. The office of Podesta was not
772,II.,"peculiar to Florence. There, as in other cities, in order to secure his"
773,II.,"impartiality, it was provided that he should be a foreigner, and hold"
774,II.,office only for six months. But he was also required to be of gentle
775,II.,"birth; and his councils were so composed that, like his own, their"
776,II.,sympathies were usually with the nobles. The Captain of the People was
777,II.,therefore created partly as a tribune for the protection of the popular
778,II.,"rights, and partly to act as permanent head of the popular forces. Like"
779,II.,"the Podesta, he had two councils assigned to him; but these were"
780,II.,"strictly representative of the citizens, and sat to control his conduct"
781,II.,as well as to lend to his action the weight of public opinion.
782,II.,
783,II.,Such of the Ghibelines as had not been banished from Florence on the
784,II.,"death of Frederick, lived there on sufferance, as it were, and under a"
785,II.,rigid supervision. Once more they were to find a patron and ally in a
786,II.,member of the great house of Hohenstaufen; and with his aid they were
787,II.,"again for a few years to become supreme in Florence, and to prove by"
788,II.,their abuse of power how well justified was the mistrust the people had
789,II.,"of them. In many ways Manfred, one of Frederick's bastards, was a worthy"
790,II.,"son of his father. Like him he was endowed with great personal charm,"
791,II.,and was enamoured of all that opened new regions to intellectual
792,II.,curiosity or gave refinement to sensual pleasure. In his public as well
793,II.,"as in his private behaviour, he was reckless of what the Church and its"
794,II.,"doctrines might promise or threaten; and equally so, his enemies"
795,II.,"declared, of the dictates of common humanity. Hostile eyes detected in"
796,II.,the green clothes which were his favourite dress a secret attachment to
797,II.,Islam; and hostile tongues charged him with the murder of a father and
798,II.,"of a brother, and the attempted murder of a nephew. His ambition did not"
799,II.,"aim at the Empire, but only at being King of Sicily and Naples, lands"
800,II.,which the Hohenstaufens claimed as their own through the Norman mother
801,II.,"of Frederick. Of these kingdoms he was actual ruler, even while his"
802,II.,legitimate brother Conrad lived. On the death of that prince he brushed
803,II.,"aside the claims of Conradin, his nephew, and bid boldly for recognition"
804,II.,"by the Pope, who claimed to be overlord of the southern kingdoms--a"
805,II.,"recognition refused, or given only to be immediately withdrawn. In the"
806,II.,"eyes of Rome he was no more than Prince of Tarentum, but by arms and"
807,II.,policy he won what seemed a firm footing in the South; and eight years
808,II.,after the rule of the _Popolo Vecchio_ began in Florence he was the
809,II.,acknowledged patron of all in Italy who had been Imperialist--for the
810,II.,Imperial throne was now practically vacant. And Manfred was trusted all
811,II.,"the more that he cared nothing for Germany, and stood out even more"
812,II.,purely an Italian monarch than his father had ever been. The Ghibelines
813,II.,of Florence looked to him to free them of the yoke under which they
814,II.,groaned.
815,II.,
816,II.,"When it was discovered that they were treating with Manfred, there was"
817,II.,an outburst of popular wrath against the disaffected nobles. Some of
818,II.,"them were seized and put to death, a fate shared by the Abbot of"
819,II.,"Vallombrosa, whom neither his priestly office nor his rank as Papal"
820,II.,Legate availed to save from torture and a shameful end.[10] Well
821,II.,"accustomed as was the age to violence and cruelty, it was shocked at"
822,II.,this free disposal of a great ecclesiastic by a mercantile community;
823,II.,and even to the Guelf chronicler Villani the terrible defeat of
824,II.,Montaperti seemed no more than a just vengeance taken by Heaven upon a
825,II.,"crime so heinous.[11] In the meantime the city was laid under interdict,"
826,II.,and those concerned in the Abbot's death were excommunicated; while the
827,II.,"Ghibelines, taking refuge in Siena, began to plot and scheme with the"
828,II.,"greater spirit against foes who, in the very face of a grave peril, had"
829,II.,offended in the Pope their strongest natural ally.
830,II.,
831,II.,"The leader of the exiles was Farinata, one of the Uberti, a family"
832,II.,"which, so long ago as 1180, had raised a civil war to force their way"
833,II.,"into the consulship. Ever since, they had been the most powerful,"
834,II.,"perhaps, and certainly the most restless, clan in Florence, rich in men"
835,II.,"of strong character, fiercely tenacious of their purpose. Such was"
836,II.,Farinata. To the Florentines of a later age he was to stand for the type
837,II.,"of the great Ghibeline gentleman, haughty as Lucifer, a Christian in"
838,II.,"name though scarcely by profession, and yet almost beloved for his frank"
839,II.,excess of pride. It detracted nothing from the grandeur of his
840,II.,"character, in the judgment of his countrymen, that he could be cunning"
841,II.,as well as brave. Manfred was coy to afford help to the Tuscan
842,II.,"Ghibelines, standing out for an exorbitant price for the loan of his"
843,II.,men-at-arms; and to Farinata was attributed the device by which his
844,II.,point of honour was effectually touched.[12] When at last a
845,II.,"reinforcement of eight hundred cavalry entered Siena, the exiles and"
846,II.,their allies felt themselves more than a match for the militia of
847,II.,"Florence, and set themselves to decoy it into the field. Earlier in the"
848,II.,"same year the Florentines had encamped before Siena, and sought in vain"
849,II.,to bring on a general engagement. They were now misled by false
850,II.,"messengers, primed by Farinata, into a belief that the Sienese, weary of"
851,II.,"the arrogance of Provenzano Salvani,[13] then all-powerful in Siena,"
852,II.,were ready to betray a gate to them. In vain did Tegghiaio
853,II.,"Aldobrandi,[14] one of the Guelf nobles, counsel delay till the German"
854,II.,"men-at-arms, wearied with waiting on and perhaps dissatisfied with their"
855,II.,"wages, should be recalled by Manfred. A march in full strength upon the"
856,II.,hostile city was resolved on by the eager townsmen.
857,II.,
858,II.,"The battle of Montaperti was fought in September 1260, among the earthy"
859,II.,"hills washed by the Arbia and its tributary rivulets, a few miles to the"
860,II.,east of Siena. It marked the close of the rule of the _Popolo Vecchio_.
861,II.,Till then no such disastrous day had come to Florence; and the defeat
862,II.,was all the more intolerable that it was counted for a victory to Siena.
863,II.,Yet the battle was far from being a test of the strength of the two
864,II.,"rival cities. Out of the thirty thousand foot in the Guelf army, there"
865,II.,were only about five thousand Florentines. In the host which poured out
866,II.,"on them from Siena, beside the militia of that city and the Florentine"
867,II.,"exiles, were included the Ghibelines of Arezzo, the retainers of great"
868,II.,"lords still unsubdued by any city, and, above all, the German"
869,II.,men-at-arms of Manfred.[15] But the worst enemies of Florence were the
870,II.,traitors in her own ranks. She bore it long in mind that it was her
871,II.,"merchants and handicraftsmen who stood stubbornly at bay, and tinged the"
872,II.,Arbia red with their life-blood; while it was among the men of high
873,II.,"degree that the traitors were found. On one of them, Bocca degli Abati,"
874,II.,"who struck off the right hand of the standard-bearer of the cavalry, and"
875,II.,"so helped on the confusion and the rout, Dante takes vengeance in his"
876,II.,pitiless verse.[16]
877,II.,
878,II.,The fortifications of Florence had been recently completed and
879,II.,"strengthened, and it was capable of a long defence. But the spirit of"
880,II.,"the people was broken for the time, and the conquerors found the gates"
881,II.,open. Then it was that Farinata almost atoned for any wrong he ever did
882,II.,"his native town, by withstanding a proposal made by the Ghibelines of"
883,II.,"the rival Tuscan cities, that Florence should be destroyed, and Empoli"
884,II.,"advanced to fill her room. 'Alone, with open face I defended her,' Dante"
885,II.,makes him say.[17] But the wonder would rather be if he had voted to
886,II.,destroy a city of which he was about to be one of the tyrants. Florence
887,II.,had now a fuller experience than ever of the oppression which it was in
888,II.,the character of the Ghibelines to exercise. A rich booty lay ready to
889,II.,their hands; for in the panic after Montaperti crowds of the best in
890,II.,"Florence had fled, leaving all behind them except their wives and"
891,II.,"children, whom they would not trust to the cruel mercy of the victors."
892,II.,It was in this exile that for the first time the industrious citizen was
893,II.,"associated with the Guelf noble. From Lucca, not powerful enough to"
894,II.,"grant them protection for long, they were driven to Bologna, suffering"
895,II.,"terribly on the passage of the Apennines from cold and want of food, but"
896,II.,safe when the mountains lay between them and the Val d'Arno. While the
897,II.,nobles and young men with a taste for fighting found their livelihood in
898,II.,"service against the Lombard Ghibelines, the more sober-minded scattered"
899,II.,themselves to seek out their commercial correspondents and increase
900,II.,their acquaintance with the markets of Europe. When at length the way
901,II.,"was open for them to return home, they came back educated by travel, as"
902,II.,men must always be who travel for a purpose; and from this second exile
903,II.,of the Guelfs dates a vast extension of the commerce of Florence.
904,II.,
905,II.,Their return was a fruit of the policy followed by the Papal Court The
906,II.,interests of both were the same. The Roman See could have as little
907,II.,independence of action while a hostile monarch was possessed of the
908,II.,"southern kingdoms, as the people of Florence could have freedom while"
909,II.,"the Ghibeline nobility had for patron a military prince, to whom their"
910,II.,gates lay open by way of Siena and Pisa. To Sicily and Naples the Pope
911,II.,laid claim by an alternative title--they were either dependent on the
912,II.,"See of Rome, or, if they were Imperial fiefs, then, in the vacancy of"
913,II.,"the Empire, the Pope, as the only head of Christendom, had a right to"
914,II.,dispose of them as he would. A champion was needed to maintain the
915,II.,"claim, and at length the man was found in Charles of Anjou, brother of"
916,II.,St. Louis. This was a prince of intellectual powers far beyond the
917,II.,"common, of untiring industry in affairs, pious, 'chaste as a monk,' and"
918,II.,"cold-hearted as a usurer; gifted with all the qualities, in short, that"
919,II.,"make a man feared and well served, and with none that make him beloved."
920,II.,"He was not one to risk failure for want of deliberation and foresight,"
921,II.,and his measures were taken with such prudence that by the time he
922,II.,landed in Italy his victory was almost assured. He found his enemy at
923,II.,"Benevento, in the Neapolitan territory (February 1266). In order to get"
924,II.,"time for reinforcements to come up, Manfred sought to enter into"
925,II.,"negotiations; but Charles was ready, and knew his advantage. He answered"
926,II.,with the splendid confidence of a man sure of a heavenly if he missed
927,II.,"an earthly triumph. 'Go tell the Sultan of Lucera,'[18] was his reply,"
928,II.,"'that to-day I shall send him to Hell, or he will send me to Paradise.'"
929,II.,"Manfred was slain, and his body, discovered only after long search, was"
930,II.,"denied Christian burial. Yet, excommunicated though he was, and"
931,II.,"suspected of being at heart as much Mohammedan as Christian, he, as well"
932,II.,"as his great rival, is found by Dante in Purgatory.[19] And, while the"
933,II.,"Christian poet pours his invective on the pious Charles,[20] he is at no"
934,II.,pains to hide how pitiful appeared to him the fate of the frank and
935,II.,"handsome Manfred, all whose followers adored him. He, as more than once"
936,II.,"it happens in the _Comedy_ to those whose memory is dear to the poet, is"
937,II.,saved from Inferno by the fiction that in the hour of death he sent one
938,II.,thought heavenward--'so wide is the embrace of infinite mercy.'[21]
939,II.,
940,II.,To Florence Charles proved a useful if a greedy and exacting protector.
941,II.,Under his influence as Pacificator of Tuscany--an office created for him
942,II.,"by the Pope--the Guelfs were enabled slowly to return from exile, and"
943,II.,the Ghibelines were gradually depressed into a condition of dependence
944,II.,on the goodwill of the citizens over whom they had so lately domineered.
945,II.,Henceforth failure attended every effort they made to lift their heads.
946,II.,The stubbornly irreconcilable were banished or put to death. Elaborate
947,II.,"provisions were enacted in obedience to the Pope's commands, by which"
948,II.,the rest were to be at peace with their old foes. Now they were to live
949,II.,"in the city, but under disabilities as regarded eligibility to offices;"
950,II.,"now they were to be represented in the public councils, but so as to be"
951,II.,"always in a minority. The result of the measures taken, and of the"
952,II.,"natural drift of things, was that ere many more years had passed there"
953,II.,were no avowed Ghibelines in Florence.
954,II.,
955,II.,One influence constantly at work in this direction was that of the
956,II.,"_Parte Guelfa_, a Florentine society formed to guard the interests of"
957,II.,"the Guelfs, and which was possessed of the greater part of the Ghibeline"
958,II.,property confiscated after the triumph of Charles had turned the balance
959,II.,of power in Italy. This organisation has been well described as a state
960,II.,"within a state, and it seems as if the part it played in the Florentine"
961,II.,"politics of this period were not yet fully known. This much seems sure,"
962,II.,that the members of the Society were mostly Guelf nobles; that its
963,II.,"power, derived from the administration of vast wealth to a political"
964,II.,"end, was so great that the Captain of the _Parte Guelfa_ held a place"
965,II.,almost on a level with that of the chief officials of the Commonwealth;
966,II.,"and that it made loans of ready money to Florence and the Pope, on"
967,II.,condition of their being used to the damage of the Ghibelines.[22]
968,II.,
969,II.,"The Commonwealth, busy in resettling its government, was but slightly"
970,II.,"interested in much that went on around it. The boy Conradin, grandson of"
971,II.,"Frederick, nephew of Manfred, and in a sense the last of the"
972,II.,"Hohenstaufens, came to Italy to measure himself with Charles, and paid"
973,II.,"for his audacity upon the scaffold.[23] Charles deputed Guy of Montfort,"
974,II.,"son of the great Earl Simon, to be his vicar in Florence. The Pope"
975,II.,"smiled and frowned in turn on the Florentines, as their devotion to him"
976,II.,"waxed and waned; and so he did on his champion Charles, whose ambition"
977,II.,was apt to outrun his piety. All this was of less importance to the
978,II.,Commonwealth than the promotion of its domestic interests. It saw with
979,II.,equanimity a check given to Charles by the election of a new Emperor in
980,II.,"Rudolf of Hapsburg (1273), and a further check by the Sicilian Vespers,"
981,II.,"which lost him half his kingdom (1283). But Siena and Pisa, Arezzo, and"
982,II.,"even Pistoia, were the objects of a sleepless anxiety. Pisa was the"
983,II.,"chief source of danger, being both from sentiment and interest"
984,II.,"stubbornly Ghibeline. When at length its power was broken by Genoa, its"
985,II.,"great maritime rival, in the naval battle of Meloria (1284), there was"
986,II.,no longer any city in Tuscany to be compared for wealth and strength
987,II.,with Florence.
988,II.,
989,II.,
990,III.,III.
991,III.,
992,III.,"It was at this period that Dante, reaching the age of manhood, began to"
993,III.,"perform the duties that fell to him as a youthful citizen--duties which,"
994,III.,"till the age of thirty was reached, were chiefly those of military"
995,III.,"service. The family to which he belonged was a branch of the Elisei,"
996,III.,who are included by Villani in the earliest catalogue given by him of
997,III.,"the great Florentine houses. Cacciaguida, one of the Elisei, born in"
998,III.,"1106, married a daughter of the Aldighieri, a family of Ferrara. Their"
999,III.,"son was christened Aldighiero, and this was adopted by the family as a"
1000,III.,"surname, afterwards changed to Alighieri. The son of Aldighiero was"
1001,III.,"Bellincione, father of Aldighiero II., the father of Dante."
1002,III.,
1003,III.,It serves no purpose to fill a page of biography with genealogical
1004,III.,details when the hero's course in life was in no way affected by the
1005,III.,"accident of who was his grandfather. In the case of Dante, his position"
1006,III.,"in the State, his political creed, and his whole fashion of regarding"
1007,III.,"life, were vitally influenced by the circumstances of his birth. He knew"
1008,III.,"that his genius, and his genius alone, was to procure him fame; he"
1009,III.,declares a virtuous and gentle life to be the true proof of nobility:
1010,III.,"and yet his family pride is always breaking through. In real life, from"
1011,III.,his family's being decayed in wealth and fallen in consideration
1012,III.,"compared with its neighbours, he may have been led to put emphasis on"
1013,III.,his assertion of gentility; and amid the poverty and humiliations of his
1014,III.,"exile he may have found a tonic in the thought that by birth, not to"
1015,III.,"speak of other things, he was the equal of those who spurned him or"
1016,III.,"coldly lent him aid. However this may be, there is a tacit claim of"
1017,III.,equality with them in the easy grace with which he encounters great
1018,III.,nobles in the world of shades. The bent of his mind in relation to this
1019,III.,subject is shown by such a touch as that when he esteems it among the
1020,III.,glories of Francis of Assisi not to have been ashamed of his base
1021,III.,extraction.[24] In Paradise he meets his great crusading ancestor
1022,III.,"Cacciaguida, and feigns contrition for the pleasure with which he"
1023,III.,listens to a declaration of the unmixed purity of their common
1024,III.,"blood.[25] In Inferno he catches a glimpse, sudden and terrible, of a"
1025,III.,"kinsman whose violent death had remained unavenged; and, for the nonce,"
1026,III.,the philosopher-poet is nothing but the member of an injured Florentine
1027,III.,"clan, and winces at the thought of a neglected blood feud.[26] And when"
1028,III.,"Farinata, the great Ghibeline, and haughtiest of all the Florentines of"
1029,III.,"the past generation, asks him, 'Who were thine ancestors?' Dante says"
1030,III.,"with a proud pretence of humility, 'Anxious to obey, I hid nothing, but"
1031,III.,told him all he demanded.'[27]
1032,III.,
1033,III.,Dante was born in Florence in the May of 1265.[28] A brother of his
1034,III.,"father had been one of the guards of the Florentine Caroccio, or"
1035,III.,"standard-bearing car, at the battle of Montaperti (1260). Whether"
1036,III.,Dante's father necessarily shared in the exile of his party may be
1037,III.,doubted. He is said--on slight authority--to have been a jurisconsult:
1038,III.,there is no reason to suppose he was at Montaperti. It is difficult to
1039,III.,believe that Florence was quite emptied of its lawyers and merchants as
1040,III.,"a consequence of the Ghibeline victory. In any case, it is certain that"
1041,III.,"while the fugitive Guelfs were mostly accompanied by their wives, and"
1042,III.,"did not return till 1267, we have Dante's own word for it that he was"
1043,III.,"born in the great city by the Arno,[29] and was baptized in the"
1044,III.,"Baptistery, his beautiful St. John's.[30] At the font he received the"
1045,III.,"name of Durante, shortened, as he bore it, into Dante. It is in this"
1046,III.,"form that it finds a place in the _Comedy_,[31] once, and only once,"
1047,III.,"written down of necessity, the poet says--the necessity of being"
1048,III.,"faithful in the report of Beatrice's words: from the wider necessity, we"
1049,III.,"may assume, of imbedding in the work itself the name by which the author"
1050,III.,"was commonly known, and by which he desired to be called for all time."
1051,III.,
1052,III.,When Dante was about ten years old he lost his father. Of his mother
1053,III.,nothing but her Christian name of Bella is known. Neither of them is
1054,III.,"mentioned in the _Comedy_,[32] nor indeed are his wife and children."
1055,III.,Boccaccio describes the Alighieri as having been in easy though not in
1056,III.,"wealthy circumstances; and Leonardo Bruni, who in the fifteenth century"
1057,III.,"sought out what he could learn of Dante, says of him that he was"
1058,III.,possessed of a patrimony sufficient for an honourable livelihood. That
1059,III.,he was so might be inferred from the character of the education he
1060,III.,"received. His studies, says Boccaccio, were not directed to any object"
1061,III.,of worldly profit. That there is no sign of their having been directed
1062,III.,by churchmen tends to prove the existence in his native town of a class
1063,III.,of cultivated laymen; and that there was such appears from the ease
1064,III.,"with which, when, passing from boyhood to manhood, he felt a craving for"
1065,III.,"intellectual and congenial society, he found in nobles of the stamp of"
1066,III.,Guido Cavalcanti men like-minded with himself. It was indeed impossible
1067,III.,"but that the revival of the study of the civil law, the importation of"
1068,III.,"new learning from the East, and the sceptical spirit fostered in Italy"
1069,III.,"by the influence of Frederick II. and his court, should all have told on"
1070,III.,"the keen-witted Florentines, of whom a great proportion--even of the"
1071,III.,common people--could read; while the class with leisure had every
1072,III.,"opportunity of knowing what was going on in the world.[33] Heresy, the"
1073,III.,"rough word for intellectual life as well as for religious aspiration,"
1074,III.,"had found in Florence a congenial soil.[34] In the thirteenth century,"
1075,III.,which modern ignorance loves to reckon as having been in a special sense
1076,III.,"an age of faith, there were many Florentines who, in spite of their"
1077,III.,"outward conformity, had drifted as far from spiritual allegiance to the"
1078,III.,Church as the furthest point reached by any of their descendants who
1079,III.,some two ages later belonged to the school of Florentine Platonists.
1080,III.,
1081,III.,"Chief among these free-thinkers, and, sooth to say, free-livers--though"
1082,III.,in this respect they were less distinguished from the orthodox--was
1083,III.,"Brunetto Latini, for some time Secretary to the Republic, and the"
1084,III.,foremost Italian man of letters of his day. Meagre though his greatest
1085,III.,"work, the _Tesoro_, or _Treasure_, must seem to any one who now glances"
1086,III.,"over its pages, to his contemporaries it answered the promise of its"
1087,III.,title and stood for a magazine of almost complete information in the
1088,III.,"domains of natural history, ethics, and politics. It was written in"
1089,III.,"French, as being a more agreeable language than Italian; and was"
1090,III.,"composed, there is reason to believe, while Latini lived in Paris as an"
1091,III.,"exiled Guelf after Montaperti. His _Tesoretto_, or _Little Treasure_, a"
1092,III.,"poem in jingling eight-syllabled Italian verse, has been thought by some"
1093,III.,to have supplied hints to Dante for the _Comedy_.[35] By neither of
1094,III.,"these works is he evinced a man of strong intellect, or even of good"
1095,III.,taste. Yet there is the testimony of Villani that he did much to refine
1096,III.,"the language of his contemporaries, and to apply fixed principles to the"
1097,III.,"conduct of State affairs.[36] Dante meets him in Inferno, and hails him"
1098,III.,as his intellectual father--as the master who taught him from day to day
1099,III.,how fame is to be won.[37] But it is too much to infer from these words
1100,III.,"that Latini served as his teacher, in the common sense of the word. It"
1101,III.,is true they imply an intimacy between the veteran scholar and his
1102,III.,young townsman; but the closeness of their intercourse is perhaps best
1103,III.,accounted for by supposing that Latini had been acquainted with Dante's
1104,III.,"father, and by the great promise of Dante's boyhood was led to take a"
1105,III.,"warm interest in his intellectual development. Their intimacy, to judge"
1106,III.,"from the tone of their conversation down in Inferno, had lasted till"
1107,III.,Latini's death. But no tender reminiscence of the days they spent
1108,III.,together avails to save him from condemnation at the hands of his severe
1109,III.,"disciple. By the manners of Brunetto, and the Epicurean heresies of"
1110,III.,"others of his friends, Dante, we may be sure, was never infected or"
1111,III.,defiled.
1112,III.,
1113,III.,Dante describes himself as having begun the serious study of philosophy
1114,III.,and theology only at the mature age of twenty-seven. But ere that time
1115,III.,"he had studied to good effect, and not books alone, but the world around"
1116,III.,"him too, and the world within. The poet was formed before the theologian"
1117,III.,and philosopher. From his earliest years he was used to write in verse;
1118,III.,and he seems to have esteemed as one of his best endowments the easy
1119,III.,command of his mother tongue acquired by him while still in boyhood.
1120,III.,
1121,III.,"Of the poems written in his youth he made a selection, and with a"
1122,III.,commentary gave them to the world as his first work.[38] All the sonnets
1123,III.,and canzoni contained in it bear more or less directly on his love for
1124,III.,"Beatrice Portinari. This lady, whose name is so indissolubly associated"
1125,III.,"with that of Dante, was the daughter of a rich citizen of good family."
1126,III.,"When Dante saw her first he was a child of nine, and she a few months"
1127,III.,"younger. It would seem fabulous, he says, if he related what things he"
1128,III.,"did, and of what a passion he was the victim during his boyhood. He"
1129,III.,"seized opportunities of beholding her, but for long never passed beyond"
1130,III.,"a silent worship; and he was eighteen before she spoke to him, and then"
1131,III.,"only in the way of a passing salutation. On this he had a vision, and"
1132,III.,"that inspired him with a sonnet, certainly not the first he had written,"
1133,III.,but the first he put into circulation. The mode of publication he
1134,III.,adopted was the common one of sending copies of it to such other poets
1135,III.,as were within reach. The sonnet in itself contains a challenge to
1136,III.,interpret his dream. Several poets attempted the riddle--among them the
1137,III.,philosopher and poet Guido Cavalcanti. They all failed in the solution;
1138,III.,"but with some of them he was thus brought into terms of intimacy, and"
1139,III.,with Cavalcanti of the closest friendship. Some new grace of style in
1140,III.,"Dante's verse, some art in the presentation of his mystical meaning that"
1141,III.,"escapes the modern reader, may have revealed to the middle-aged man of"
1142,III.,letters that a new genius had arisen. It was by Guido's advice that the
1143,III.,poems of which this sonnet stands the first were some years later
1144,III.,"collected and published with the explanatory narrative. To him, in a"
1145,III.,"sense, the whole work is addressed; and it agreed with his taste, as"
1146,III.,"well as Dante's own, that it should contain nothing but what was written"
1147,III.,in the vulgar tongue. Others besides Guido must have recognised in the
1148,III.,"little book, as it passed from hand to hand, the masterpiece of Italian"
1149,III.,"prose, as well as of Italian verse. In the simple title of _Vita Nuova_,"
1150,III.,"or _The New Life_,[39] we can fancy that a claim is laid to originality"
1151,III.,"of both subject and treatment. Through the body of the work, though not"
1152,III.,"so clearly as in the _Comedy_, there rings the note of assurance of"
1153,III.,safety from present neglect and future oblivion.
1154,III.,
1155,III.,It may be owing to the free use of personification and symbol in the
1156,III.,"_Vita Nuova_ that some critics, while not denying the existence of a"
1157,III.,"real Beatrice, have held that she is introduced only to help out an"
1158,III.,"allegory, and that, under the veil of love for her, the poet would"
1159,III.,"express his youthful passion for truth. Others, going to the opposite"
1160,III.,"extreme, are found wondering why he never sought, or, seeking, failed to"
1161,III.,"win, the hand of Beatrice. To those who would refine the Beatrice of the"
1162,III.,"early work into a being as purely allegorical as she of the _Comedy_, it"
1163,III.,may be conceded that the _Vita Nuova_ is not so much the history of a
1164,III.,first love as of the new emotional and intellectual life to which a
1165,III.,"first love, as Dante experienced it, opens the door. Out of the"
1166,III.,incidents of their intercourse he chooses only such as serve for motives
1167,III.,to the joys and sorrows of the passionate aspiring soul. On the other
1168,III.,"hand, they who seek reasons why Dante did not marry Beatrice have this"
1169,III.,"to justify their curiosity, that she did marry another man. But her"
1170,III.,husband was one of the rich and powerful Bardi; and her father was so
1171,III.,wealthy that after providing for his children he could endow a hospital
1172,III.,in Florence. The marriage was doubtless arranged as a matter of family
1173,III.,"convenience, due regard being had to her dower and her husband's"
1174,III.,"fortune; and we may assume that when Dante, too, was married later on,"
1175,III.,his wife was found for him by the good offices of his friends.[40] Our
1176,III.,manners as regards these things are not those of the Italy of the
1177,III.,thirteenth century. It may safely be said that Dante never dreamed of
1178,III.,Beatrice for his wife; that the expectation of wedding her would have
1179,III.,sealed his lips from uttering to the world any word of his love; and
1180,III.,"that she would have lost something in his esteem if, out of love for"
1181,III.,"him, she had refused the man her father chose for her."
1182,III.,
1183,III.,We must not seek in the _Vita Nuova_ what it does not profess to give.
1184,III.,"There was a real Beatrice Portinari, to a careless glance perhaps not"
1185,III.,differing much from other Florentine ladies of her age and condition;
1186,III.,but her we do not find in Dante's pages. These are devoted to a record
1187,III.,"of the dreams and visions, the new thoughts and feelings of which she"
1188,III.,"was the occasion or the object. He worshipped at a distance, and in a"
1189,III.,single glance found reward enough for months of adoration; he read all
1190,III.,"heaven into a smile. So high strung is the narrative, that did we come"
1191,III.,on any hint of loving dalliance it would jar with all the rest She is
1192,III.,"always at a distance from him, less a woman than an angel."
1193,III.,
1194,III.,In all this there is certainly as much of reticence as of exaggeration.
1195,III.,When he comes to speak of her death he uses a phrase on which it would
1196,III.,seem as if too little value had been set. He cannot dwell on the
1197,III.,"circumstances of her departure, he says, without being his own"
1198,III.,"panegyrist. Taken along with some other expressions in the _Vita Nuova_,"
1199,III.,"and the tone of her words to him when they meet in the Earthly Paradise,"
1200,III.,we may gather from this that not only was she aware of his long
1201,III.,"devotion, but that, ere she died, he had been given to understand how"
1202,III.,"highly she rated it. And on the occasion of her death, one described as"
1203,III.,"being her nearest relative by blood and, after Cavalcanti, Dante's chief"
1204,III.,"friend--her brother, no doubt--came to him and begged him to write"
1205,III.,something concerning her. It would be strange indeed if they had never
1206,III.,"looked frankly into one another's faces; and yet, for anything that is"
1207,III.,"directly told in the _Vita Nuova_, they never did."
1208,III.,
1209,III.,The chief value of the _Vita Nuova_ is therefore psychological. It is a
1210,III.,mine of materials illustrative of the author's mental and emotional
1211,III.,"development, but as regards historical details it is wanting in fulness"
1212,III.,"and precision. Yet, even in such a sketch of Dante's life as this tries"
1213,III.,"to be, it is necessary to dwell on the turning-points of the narrative"
1214,III.,contained in the _Vita Nuova_; the reader always remembering that on one
1215,III.,"side Dante says more than the fact that so he may glorify his love, and"
1216,III.,less on another that he may not fail in consideration for Beatrice. She
1217,III.,is first a maiden whom no public breath is to disturb in her virgin
1218,III.,"calm; and afterwards a chaste wife, whose lover is as jealous of her"
1219,III.,reputation as any husband could be. The youthful lover had begun by
1220,III.,propounding the riddle of his love so obscurely that even by his
1221,III.,"fellow-poets it had been found insoluble, adepts though they themselves"
1222,III.,"were in the art of smothering a thought. Then, though all his longing is"
1223,III.,"for Beatrice, lest she become the subject of common talk he feigns that"
1224,III.,he is in love first with one lady and then with another.[41] He even
1225,III.,pushes his deceit so far that she rebukes him for his fickleness to one
1226,III.,of his sham loves by denying him the customary salutation when they
1227,III.,meet--this salutation being the only sign of friendship she has ever
1228,III.,shown. It is already some few years since the first sonnet was written.
1229,III.,"Now, in a ballad containing a more direct avowal of his love than he has"
1230,III.,"yet ventured on,[42] he protests that it was always Beatrice his heart"
1231,III.,"was busy with, and that to her, though his eyes may have seemed to"
1232,III.,"wander, his affection was always true. In the very next poem we find him"
1233,III.,as if debating with himself whether he shall persevere. He weighs the
1234,III.,"ennobling influence of a pure love and the sweetness it gives to life,"
1235,III.,against the pains and self-denial to which it condemns its servant.
1236,III.,"Here, he tells us in his commentary, he was like a traveller who has"
1237,III.,come to where the ways divide. His only means of escape--and he feels it
1238,III.,is a poor one--is to throw himself into the arms of Pity.
1239,III.,
1240,III.,From internal evidence it seems reasonably certain that the marriage of
1241,III.,Beatrice fell at the time when he describes himself as standing at the
1242,III.,parting of the ways. Before that he has been careful to write of his
1243,III.,love in terms so general as to be understood only by those in possession
1244,III.,"of the key. Now he makes direct mention of her, and seeks to be in her"
1245,III.,company; and he even leads us to infer that it was owing to his poems
1246,III.,that she became a well-known personage in the streets of Florence.
1247,III.,"Immediately after the sonnet in which he has recourse to Pity, he tells"
1248,III.,"how he was led by a friend into the house of a lady, married only that"
1249,III.,"day, whom they find surrounded by her lady friends, met to celebrate her"
1250,III.,home-coming after marriage. It was the fashion for young gentlemen to
1251,III.,offer their services at such a feast. On this occasion Dante for one can
1252,III.,give no help. A sudden trembling seizes him; he leans for support
1253,III.,"against the painted wall of the chamber; then, lifting his eyes to see"
1254,III.,"if the ladies have remarked his plight, he is troubled at beholding"
1255,III.,"Beatrice among them, with a smile on her lips, as, leaning towards her,"
1256,III.,"they mock at her lover's weakness. To his friend, who, as he leads him"
1257,III.,"from the chamber, asks what ails him, he replies: 'My feet have reached"
1258,III.,that point beyond which if they pass they can never return.' It was only
1259,III.,matrons that gathered round a bride at her home-coming; Beatrice was
1260,III.,therefore by this time a married woman. That she was but newly married
1261,III.,we may infer from Dante's confusion on finding her there.[43] His secret
1262,III.,"has now been discovered, and he must either renounce his love, or, as he"
1263,III.,"is at length free to do, Beatrice being married, declare it openly, and"
1264,III.,spend his life in loyal devotion to her as the mistress of his
1265,III.,imagination and of his heart.[44]
1266,III.,
1267,III.,"But how is he to pursue his devotion to her, and make use of his new"
1268,III.,"privilege of freer intercourse, when the very sight of her so unmans"
1269,III.,him? He writes three sonnets explaining what may seem pusillanimity in
1270,III.,"him, and resolves to write no more. Now comes the most fruitful episode"
1271,III.,in the history. Questioned by a bevy of fair ladies what is the end of a
1272,III.,"love like his, that cannot even face the object of its desire, he"
1273,III.,answers that his happiness lies in the words by which he shows forth the
1274,III.,praises of his mistress. He has now discovered that his passion is its
1275,III.,"own reward. In other words, he has succeeded in spiritualising his love;"
1276,III.,although to a careless reader it might seem in little need of passing
1277,III.,"through the process. Then, soon after, as he walks by a crystal brook,"
1278,III.,he is inspired with the words which begin the noblest poem he had yet
1279,III.,"produced,[45] and that as the author of which he is hailed by a"
1280,III.,fellow-poet in Purgatory. It is the first to glorify Beatrice as one in
1281,III.,"whom Heaven is more concerned than Earth; and in it, too, he anticipates"
1282,III.,"his journey through the other world. She dies,[46] and we are surprised"
1283,III.,to find that within a year of her death he wavers in his allegiance to
1284,III.,"her memory. A fair face, expressing a tender compassion, looks down on"
1285,III.,him from a window as he goes nursing his great sorrow; and he loves the
1286,III.,owner of the face because she pities him. But seeing Beatrice in a
1287,III.,"vision he is restored, and the closing sonnet tells how his whole desire"
1288,III.,"goes forth to her, and how his spirit is borne above the highest sphere"
1289,III.,"to behold her receiving honour, and shedding radiance on all around her."
1290,III.,The narrative closes with a reference to a vision which he does not
1291,III.,"recount, but which incites him to severe study in order that he may"
1292,III.,learn to write of her as she deserves. And the last sentence of the
1293,III.,_Vita Nuova_ expresses a hope--a hope which would be arrogant coming
1294,III.,"after anything less perfect than the _Vita Nuova_--that, concerning her,"
1295,III.,he shall yet say things never said before of any woman. Thus the poet's
1296,III.,"earliest work contains an earnest of the latest, and his morning makes"
1297,III.,one day with his evening.
1298,III.,
1299,III.,"The narrative of the _Vita Nuova_ is fluent and graceful, in this"
1300,III.,contrasting strongly with the analytical arguments attached to the
1301,III.,various poems. Dante treats his readers as if they were able to catch
1302,III.,"the meaning of the most recondite allegory, and yet were ignorant of the"
1303,III.,"alphabet of literary form. And, as is the case with other poets of the"
1304,III.,"time, the free movement of his fancy is often hampered by the necessity"
1305,III.,he felt of expressing himself in the language of the popular scholastic
1306,III.,"philosophy. All this is but to say that he was a man of his period, as"
1307,III.,well as a great genius. And even in this his first work he bettered the
1308,III.,"example of Guido Cavalcanti, Guido of Bologna, and the others whom he"
1309,III.,"found, but did not long suffer to remain, the masters of Italian"
1310,III.,verse.[47] These inherited from the Provençal and Sicilian poets much
1311,III.,of the cant of which European poetry has been so slow to clear itself;
1312,III.,and chiefly that of presenting all human emotion and volition under the
1313,III.,"figure of love for a mistress, who was often merely a creature of fancy,"
1314,III.,set up to act as Queen of Beauty while the poet ran his intellectual
1315,III.,"jousts. But Dante dealt in no feigned inspiration, and distinguishes"
1316,III.,himself from the whole school of philosophical and artificial poets as
1317,III.,'one who can only speak as love inspires.'[48] He may deal in allegory
1318,III.,"and utter sayings dark enough, but the first suggestions of his thoughts"
1319,III.,are obtained from facts of emotion or of real life. His lady was no
1320,III.,"creature of fancy, but his neighbour Beatrice Portinari: and she who"
1321,III.,"ends in the _Paradiso_ as the embodied beauty of holiness was, to begin"
1322,III.,"with, a fair Florentine girl."
1323,III.,
1324,III.,"The instance of Beatrice is the strongest, although others might be"
1325,III.,"adduced, to illustrate Dante's economy of actual experience; the skilful"
1326,III.,"use, that is, of real emotions and incidents to serve for suggestion and"
1327,III.,"material of poetical thought. As has been told, towards the close of the"
1328,III.,_Vita Nuova_ he describes how he found a temporary consolation for the
1329,III.,"loss of Beatrice in the pity of a fair and noble lady. In his next work,"
1330,III.,"the _Convito_, or _Banquet_, she appears as the personification of"
1331,III.,philosophy. The plan of the _Convito_ is that of a commentary on odes
1332,III.,which are interpreted as having various meanings--among others the
1333,III.,literal as distinguished from the allegorical or essentially true. As
1334,III.,"far as this lady is concerned, Dante shows some eagerness to pass from"
1335,III.,"the literal meaning; desirous, it may be, to correct the belief that he"
1336,III.,had ever wavered in his exclusive devotion to Beatrice. That for a time
1337,III.,he did transfer his thoughts from Beatrice in Heaven to the fair lady of
1338,III.,"the window is almost certain, and by the time he wrote the _Purgatorio_"
1339,III.,he was able to make confession of such a fault. But at the earlier
1340,III.,"period at which the _Convito_[49] was written, he may have come to"
1341,III.,regard the avowal in the _Vita Nuova_ as an oversight dishonouring to
1342,III.,"himself as well as to his first love, and so have slurred it over,"
1343,III.,"leaving the fact to stand enveloped in an allegory. At any rate, to his"
1344,III.,gloss upon this passage in his life we are indebted for an interesting
1345,III.,"account of how, at the age of twenty-seven, he put himself to school:--"
1346,III.,
1347,III.,"'After losing the earliest joy of my life, I was so smitten with"
1348,III.,sorrow that in nothing could I find any comfort. Yet after some
1349,III.,"time my mind, eager to recover its tone, since nought that I or"
1350,III.,"others could do availed to restore me, directed itself to find how"
1351,III.,"people, being disconsolate, had been comforted. And so I took to"
1352,III.,"reading that little-known book by Boethius, by writing which he,"
1353,III.,"captive and in exile, had obtained relief. Next, hearing that Tully"
1354,III.,"as well had written a book in which, treating of friendship, he had"
1355,III.,consoled the worthy Laelius on the occasion of the loss of his
1356,III.,"friend Scipio, I read that too. And though at the first I found"
1357,III.,"their meaning hard, at last I comprehended it as far as my"
1358,III.,knowledge of the language and some little command of mother-wit
1359,III.,enabled me to do: which same mother-wit had already helped me to
1360,III.,"much, as may be seen by the _Vita Nuova_. And as it often happens"
1361,III.,"that a man goes seeking silver, and lights on gold he is not"
1362,III.,"looking for--the result of chance, or of some divine provision; so"
1363,III.,"I, besides finding the consolation I was in search of to dry my"
1364,III.,"tears, became possessed of wisdom from authors and sciences and"
1365,III.,"books. Weighing this well, I deemed that philosophy, the mistress"
1366,III.,"of these authors, sciences, and books, must be the best of all"
1367,III.,"things. And imagining her to myself fashioned like a great lady,"
1368,III.,"rich in compassion, my admiration of her was so unbounded that I"
1369,III.,was always delighting myself in her image. And from thus beholding
1370,III.,her in fancy I went on to frequent the places where she is to be
1371,III.,"found in very deed--in the schools of theology, to wit, and the"
1372,III.,"debates of philosophers. So that in a little time, thirty months or"
1373,III.,"so, I began to taste so much of her sweetness that the love I bore"
1374,III.,to her effaced or banished every other thought.'[50]
1375,III.,
1376,III.,No one would guess from this description of how he grew enamoured of
1377,III.,"philosophy, that at the beginning of his arduous studies Dante took a"
1378,III.,"wife. She was Gemma, the daughter of Manetto Donati, but related only"
1379,III.,"distantly, if at all, to the great Corso Donati. They were married in"
1380,III.,"1292, he being twenty-seven; and in the course of the nine years that"
1381,III.,elapsed till his exile she bore him five sons and two daughters.[51]
1382,III.,"From his silence regarding her in his works, and from some words of"
1383,III.,"Boccaccio's which apply only to the period of his exile, it has been"
1384,III.,inferred that the union was unhappy. But Dante makes no mention in his
1385,III.,writings of his parents or children any more than of Gemma.[52] And why
1386,III.,"should not his wife be included among the things dearest to him which,"
1387,III.,"he tells us, he had to leave behind him on his banishment? For anything"
1388,III.,"we know to the contrary, their wedded life up to the time of his exile"
1389,III.,may have been happy enough; although most probably the marriage was one
1390,III.,"of convenience, and almost certainly Dante found little in Gemma's mind"
1391,III.,that answered to his own.[53] In any case it is not safe to lay stress
1392,III.,upon his silence. During the period covered by the _Vita Nuova_ he
1393,III.,"served more than once in the field, and to this none of his earlier"
1394,III.,"works make any reference. In 1289, Arezzo having warmly espoused the"
1395,III.,"Ghibeline cause, the Florentines, led by Corso Donati and the great"
1396,III.,"merchant Vieri dei Cerchi, took up arms and met the foe in the field of"
1397,III.,"Campaldino, on the edge of the upland region of the Casentino. Dante, as"
1398,III.,"a young man of means and family, fought in the vanguard;[54] and in a"
1399,III.,letter partly preserved by one of his early biographers[55] he describes
1400,III.,"himself as being then no tiro in arms, and as having with varying"
1401,III.,emotions watched the fortunes of the day. From this it is clear that he
1402,III.,"had served before, probably in an expedition into the Aretine territory"
1403,III.,"made in the previous year, and referred to in the _Inferno_.[56] In the"
1404,III.,same year as Campaldino was won he was present at the surrender of
1405,III.,"Caprona, a fortress belonging to Pisa.[57] But of all this he is silent"
1406,III.,"in his works, or only makes casual mention of it by way of illustration."
1407,III.,"It is, therefore, a waste of time trying to prove his domestic misery"
1408,III.,from his silence about his marriage.
1409,III.,
1410,III.,
1411,IV.,IV.
1412,IV.,
1413,IV.,So hard a student was Dante that he now for a time nearly lost the use
1414,IV.,"of his eyes.[58] But he was cured by regimen, and came to see as well as"
1415,IV.,"ever, he tells us; which we can easily believe was very well indeed. For"
1416,IV.,"his work, as he planned it out, he needed all his powers. The _Convito_,"
1417,IV.,"for example, was designed to admit of a full treatment of all that"
1418,IV.,concerns philosophy. It marks an earlier stage of his intellectual and
1419,IV.,spiritual life than does the opening of the _Inferno_. In it we have the
1420,IV.,fruit of the years during which he was wandering astray from his early
1421,IV.,"ideal, misled by what he afterwards came to count as a vain and"
1422,IV.,"profitless curiosity. Most of its contents, as we have it,[59] are only"
1423,IV.,indirectly interesting. It is impossible for most people to care for
1424,IV.,"discussions, conducted with all the nicety of scholastic definition, on"
1425,IV.,such subjects as the system of the universe as it was evolved out of the
1426,IV.,brains of philosophers; the subject-matter of knowledge; and how we
1427,IV.,know. But there is one section of it possessed of a very special
1428,IV.,"interest, the Fourth, in which he treats of the nature of nobility."
1429,IV.,"This he affirms to be independent of wealth or ancestry, and he finds"
1430,IV.,every one to be noble who practises the virtues proper to his time of
1431,IV.,life. 'None of the Uberti of Florence or the Visconti of Milan can say
1432,IV.,he is noble because belonging to such or such a race; for the Divine
1433,IV.,"seed is sown not in a family but in the individual man.' This amounts,"
1434,IV.,"it must be admitted, to no more than saying that high birth is one"
1435,IV.,"thing, and nobility of character another; but it is significant of what"
1436,IV.,"were the current opinions, that Dante should be at such pains to"
1437,IV.,distinguish between the two qualities. The canzone which supplies the
1438,IV.,text for the treatise closes with a picture of the noble soul at every
1439,IV.,"stage of life, to which Chaucer may well have been indebted for his"
1440,IV.,description of the true gentleman:[60]--'The soul that is adorned by
1441,IV.,"this grace does not keep it hid, but from the day when soul is wed to"
1442,IV.,"body shows it forth even until death. In early life she is modest,"
1443,IV.,"obedient, and gentle, investing the outward form and all its members"
1444,IV.,"with a gracious beauty: in youth she is temperate and strong, full of"
1445,IV.,"love and courteous ways, delighting in loyal deeds: in mature age she is"
1446,IV.,"prudent, and just, and apt to liberality, rejoicing to hear of others'"
1447,IV.,"good. Then in the fourth stage of life she is married again to God,[61]"
1448,IV.,and contemplates her approaching end with thankfulness for all the
1449,IV.,past.'[62]
1450,IV.,
1451,IV.,In this passage it is less the poet that is heard than the sober
1452,IV.,"moralist, one with a ripe experience of life, and contemptuous of the"
1453,IV.,vulgar objects of ambition. The calm is on the surface. As has been said
1454,IV.,"above, he was proud of his own birth, the more proud perhaps that his"
1455,IV.,station was but a middling one; and to the close of his life he hated
1456,IV.,"upstarts with their sudden riches, while the Philip Argenti on whom in"
1457,IV.,the _Inferno_ he takes what has much the air of a private revenge may
1458,IV.,have been only a specimen of the violent and haughty nobles with whom he
1459,IV.,stood on an uneasy footing.
1460,IV.,
1461,IV.,Yet the impression we get of Dante's surroundings in Florence from the
1462,IV.,"_Vita Nuova_ and other poems, from references in the _Comedy_, and from"
1463,IV.,some anecdotes more or less true which survive in the pages of Boccaccio
1464,IV.,"and elsewhere, is on the whole a pleasant one. We should mistake did we"
1465,IV.,think of him as always in the guise of absorbed student or tearful
1466,IV.,"lover. Friends he had, and society of various kinds. He tells how in a"
1467,IV.,"severe illness he was nursed by a young and noble lady, nearly related"
1468,IV.,to him by blood--his sister most probably; and other ladies are
1469,IV.,mentioned as watching in his sick-chamber.[63] With Forese and Piccarda
1470,IV.,"Donati, brother and sister of the great Corso Donati, he was on terms of"
1471,IV.,"the warmest friendship.[64] From the _Vita Nuova_ we can gather that,"
1472,IV.,even when his whole heart fainted and failed at the mere sight of
1473,IV.,"Beatrice, he was a favourite with other ladies and conversed familiarly"
1474,IV.,with them. The brother of Beatrice was his dear friend; while among
1475,IV.,those of the elder generation he could reckon on the friendship of such
1476,IV.,"men as Guido Cavalcanti and Brunetto Latini. Through Latini he would,"
1477,IV.,"even as a young man, get the entry of the most lettered and"
1478,IV.,intellectually active society of Florence. The tradition of his intimacy
1479,IV.,"with Giotto is supported by the mention he makes of the painter,[65] and"
1480,IV.,"by the fact, referred to in the _Vita Nuova_, that he was himself a"
1481,IV.,draughtsman. It is to be regretted there are not more anecdotes of him
1482,IV.,on record like that which tells how one day as he drew an angel on his
1483,IV.,tablets he was broken in upon by 'certain people of importance.' The
1484,IV.,"musician Casella, whom he 'woes to sing in Purgatory'[66] and Belacqua,"
1485,IV.,"the indolent good-humoured lutemaker,[67] are greeted by him in a tone"
1486,IV.,"of friendly warmth in the one case and of easy familiarity in the other,"
1487,IV.,which help us to know the terms on which he stood with the quick-witted
1488,IV.,artist class in Florence.[68] Already he was in the enjoyment of a high
1489,IV.,"reputation as a poet and scholar, and there seemed no limit to the"
1490,IV.,greatness he might attain to in his native town as a man of action as
1491,IV.,well as a man of thought.
1492,IV.,
1493,IV.,In most respects the Florence of that day was as fitting a home for a
1494,IV.,man of genius as could well be imagined. It was full of a life which
1495,IV.,seemed restless only because the possibilities of improvement for the
1496,IV.,individual and the community seemed infinite. A true measure of its
1497,IV.,political progress and of the activity of men's minds is supplied by the
1498,IV.,changes then being made in the outward aspect of the city. The duties of
1499,IV.,"the Government were as much municipal as political, and it would have"
1500,IV.,surprised a Florentine to be told that the one kind of service was of
1501,IV.,"less dignity than the other. The population grew apace, and, to provide"
1502,IV.,"the means for extending the city walls, every citizen, on pain of his"
1503,IV.,"testament being found invalid, was required to bequeath a part of his"
1504,IV.,estate to the public. Already the banks of the Arno were joined by three
1505,IV.,"bridges of stone, and the main streets were paved with the"
1506,IV.,irregularly-shaped blocks of lava still familiar to the sojourner in
1507,IV.,Florence. But between the time of Dante's boyhood and the close of the
1508,IV.,"century the other outstanding features of the city were greatly altered,"
1509,IV.,or were in the course of change. The most important churches of
1510,IV.,"Florence, as he first knew it, were the Baptistery and the neighbouring"
1511,IV.,small cathedral church of Santa Reparata; after these ranked the church
1512,IV.,"of the Trinity, Santo Stefano, and some other churches which are now"
1513,IV.,"replaced by larger ones, or of which the site alone can be discovered."
1514,IV.,"On the other side of the river, Samminiato with its elegant façade rose"
1515,IV.,as now upon its hill.[69] The only great civic building was the Palace
1516,IV.,of the Podesta. The Old Market was and had long been the true centre of
1517,IV.,the city's life.
1518,IV.,
1519,IV.,At the time Dante went into exile Arnolfo was already working on the
1520,IV.,"great new cathedral of St. Mary of the Flowers, the spacious Santa"
1521,IV.,"Croce, and the graceful Badia; and Santa Maria Novella was slowly"
1522,IV.,assuming the perfection of form that was later to make it the favourite
1523,IV.,"of Michel Angelo. The Palace of the Signory was already planned, though"
1524,IV.,half a century was to elapse before its tower soared aloft to daunt the
1525,IV.,"private strongholds which bristled, fierce and threatening, all over the"
1526,IV.,"city. The bell-tower of Giotto, too, was of later erection--the only"
1527,IV.,pile we can almost regret that Dante never saw. The architect of it was
1528,IV.,however already adorning the walls of palace and cloister with paintings
1529,IV.,"whose inspiration was no longer, like that of the works they"
1530,IV.,"overshadowed, drawn from the outworn motives of Byzantine art, but from"
1531,IV.,the faithful observation of nature.[70] He in painting and the Pisan
1532,IV.,school in sculpture were furnishing the world with novel types of beauty
1533,IV.,"in the plastic arts, answering to the 'sweet new style' in verse of"
1534,IV.,which it was Dante that discovered the secret.[71]
1535,IV.,
1536,IV.,Florence was now by far the leading city in Tuscany. Its merchants and
1537,IV.,money-dealers were in correspondence with every Mediterranean port and
1538,IV.,with every country of the West. Along with bales of goods and letters of
1539,IV.,exchange new ideas and fresh intelligence were always on the road to
1540,IV.,"Florence. The knowledge of what was going on in the world, and of what"
1541,IV.,"men were thinking, was part of the stock-in-trade of the quick-witted"
1542,IV.,"citizens, and they were beginning to be employed throughout Europe in"
1543,IV.,"diplomatic work, till then almost a monopoly of churchmen. 'These"
1544,IV.,"Florentines seem to me to form a fifth element,' said Boniface, who had"
1545,IV.,ample experience of how accomplished they were.
1546,IV.,
1547,IV.,At home they had full employment for their political genius; and still
1548,IV.,"upon the old problem, of how to curb the arrogance of the class that, in"
1549,IV.,"place of being satisfied to share in the general prosperity, sought its"
1550,IV.,"profit in the maintenance of privilege. It is necessary, at the cost of"
1551,IV.,"what may look like repetition, to revert to the presence and activity of"
1552,IV.,"this class in Florence, if we are to form a true idea of the"
1553,IV.,"circumstances of Dante's life, and enter into the spirit with which much"
1554,IV.,of the _Comedy_ is informed. Though many of the nobles were now engaged
1555,IV.,"in commerce and figured among the popular leaders, most of the greater"
1556,IV.,houses stood proudly aloof from everything that might corrupt their
1557,IV.,"gentility. These were styled the magnates: they found, as it were, a"
1558,IV.,vocation for themselves in being nobles. Among them the true distinctive
1559,IV.,"spirit of Ghibelinism survived, although none of them would now have"
1560,IV.,dared to describe himself as a Ghibeline. Their strength lay partly in
1561,IV.,the unlimited control they retained over the serfs on their landward
1562,IV.,estates; in the loyalty with which the members of a family held by one
1563,IV.,another; in their great command of resources as the administrators of
1564,IV.,the _Parte Guelfa_; and in the popularity they enjoyed with the smaller
1565,IV.,"people in consequence of their lavish expenditure, and frank if insolent"
1566,IV.,"manners. By law scarcely the equals of the full citizens, in point of"
1567,IV.,"fact they tyrannised over them. Their houses, set like fortresses in the"
1568,IV.,"crowded streets, frequently served as prisons and torture-chambers for"
1569,IV.,the low-born traders or artisans who might offend them.
1570,IV.,
1571,IV.,Measures enough had been passed towards the close of the century with a
1572,IV.,view to curb the insolence of the magnates; but the difficulty was to
1573,IV.,"get them put in force. At length, in 1294, they, with many additional"
1574,IV.,"reforms, were embodied in the celebrated Ordinances of Justice. These"
1575,IV.,for long were counted back to as the Great Charter of Florence--a Great
1576,IV.,Charter defining the popular rights and the disabilities of the
1577,IV.,baronage. Punishments of special severity were enacted for nobles who
1578,IV.,"should wrong a plebeian, and the whole of a family or clan was made"
1579,IV.,responsible for the crimes and liabilities of its several members. The
1580,IV.,smaller tradesmen were conciliated by being admitted to a share in
1581,IV.,political influence. If serfage was already abolished in the State of
1582,IV.,"Florence, it was the Ordinances which made it possible for the serf to"
1583,IV.,use his liberty.[72] But the greatest blow dealt to the nobles by the
1584,IV.,"new laws was their exclusion, as nobles, from all civil and political"
1585,IV.,offices. These they could hold only by becoming members of one of the
1586,IV.,trade guilds.[73] And to deprive a citizen of his rights it was enough
1587,IV.,to inscribe his name in the list of magnates.
1588,IV.,
1589,IV.,It is not known in what year Dante became a member of the Guild of
1590,IV.,Apothecaries. Without much reason it has been assumed that he was one of
1591,IV.,the nobles who took advantage of the law of 1294. But there is no
1592,IV.,"evidence that in his time the Alighieri ranked as magnates, and much"
1593,IV.,ground for believing that for some considerable time past they had
1594,IV.,belonged to the order of full citizens.
1595,IV.,
1596,IV.,It was not necessary for every guildsman to practise the art or engage
1597,IV.,"in the business to which his guild was devoted, and we are not required"
1598,IV.,to imagine Dante as having anything to do with medicine or with the
1599,IV.,spices and precious stones in which the apothecaries traded. The guilds
1600,IV.,"were political as much as industrial associations, and of the public"
1601,IV.,duties of his membership he took his full share. The constitution of the
1602,IV.,"Republic, jealously careful to limit the power of the individual"
1603,IV.,"citizen, provided that the two chief executive officers, the Podesta and"
1604,IV.,"the Captain of the People, should always be foreigners. They held office"
1605,IV.,"only for six months. To each of them was assigned a numerous Council,"
1606,IV.,and before a law could be abrogated or a new one passed it needed the
1607,IV.,"approval of both these Councils, as well as that of the Priors, and of"
1608,IV.,"the heads of the principal guilds. The Priors were six in number, one"
1609,IV.,for each district of the city. With them lay the administration in
1610,IV.,"general of the laws, and the conduct of foreign affairs. Their office"
1611,IV.,"was elective, and held for two months.[74] Of one or other of the"
1612,IV.,"Councils Dante is known to have been a member in 1295, 1296, 1300, and"
1613,IV.,1301.[75] In 1299 he is found engaged on a political mission to the
1614,IV.,"little hill-city of San Gemigniano, where in the town-house they still"
1615,IV.,show the pulpit from which he addressed the local senate.[76] From the
1616,IV.,middle of June till the middle of August 1300 he served as one of the
1617,IV.,Priors.[77]
1618,IV.,
1619,IV.,"At the time when Dante entered on this office, Florence was distracted"
1620,IV.,"by the feud of Blacks and Whites, names borrowed from the factions of"
1621,IV.,"Pistoia, but fated to become best known from their use in the city which"
1622,IV.,adopted them. The strength of the Blacks lay in the nobles whom the
1623,IV.,Ordinances of Justice had been designed to depress; both such of them as
1624,IV.,"had retained their standing as magnates, and such as, under the new law,"
1625,IV.,had unwillingly entered the ranks of the citizens. Already they had
1626,IV.,"succeeded in driving into exile Giano della Bella,[78] the chief author"
1627,IV.,"of the Ordinances; and their efforts--and those of the citizens who,"
1628,IV.,"fearing the growing power of the lesser guilds, were in sympathy with"
1629,IV.,them--were steadily directed to upset the reforms. An obvious means to
1630,IV.,this end was to lower in popular esteem the public men whose policy it
1631,IV.,was to govern firmly on the new lines. The leader of the discontented
1632,IV.,"party was Corso Donati, a man of small fortune, but of high birth; of"
1633,IV.,"splendid personal appearance, open-handed, and of popular manners. He"
1634,IV.,"and they who went with him affected a violent Guelfism, their chance of"
1635,IV.,recovering the control of domestic affairs being the better the more
1636,IV.,they could frighten the Florentines with threats of evils like those
1637,IV.,incurred by the Aretines and Pisans from Ghibeline oppression. It may be
1638,IV.,imagined what meaning the cry of Ghibeline possessed in days when there
1639,IV.,was still a class of beggars in Florence--men of good names--whose eyes
1640,IV.,had been torn out by Farinata and his kind.
1641,IV.,
1642,IV.,One strong claim which Corso Donati had on the goodwill of his
1643,IV.,fellow-townsmen was that by his ready courage in pushing on the
1644,IV.,"reserves, against superior orders, at the battle of Campaldino,[79] the"
1645,IV.,day had been won to Florence and her allies. As he rode gallantly
1646,IV.,"through the streets he was hailed as the Baron (_il Barone_), much as in"
1647,IV.,the last generation the victor of Waterloo was sufficiently
1648,IV.,"distinguished as the Duke. At the same battle, Vieri dei Cerchi, the"
1649,IV.,"leader of the opposite party of the Whites, had shown no less bravery,"
1650,IV.,"but he was ignorant of the art, or despised it, of making political"
1651,IV.,capital out of the performance of his duty. In almost every respect he
1652,IV.,"offered a contrast to Donati. He was of a new family, and his influence"
1653,IV.,"depended not on landed possessions, though he had these too, but on"
1654,IV.,"wealth derived from commerce.[80] According to John Villani, a competent"
1655,IV.,"authority on such a point,[81] he was at the head of one of the greatest"
1656,IV.,trading houses in the world. The same crowds that cheered Corso as the
1657,IV.,great Baron sneered at the reticent and cold-tempered merchant as the
1658,IV.,"Ghibeline. It was a strange perversion of ideas, and yet had this of"
1659,IV.,"justification, that all the nobles of Ghibeline tendency and all the"
1660,IV.,"citizens who, on account of their birth, were suspected of leaning that"
1661,IV.,way were driven into the party of the Whites by the mere fact of the
1662,IV.,"Blacks hoisting so defiantly the Guelf flag, and commanding the"
1663,IV.,"resources of the _Parte Guelfa_. But if Ghibelinism meant, as fifty"
1664,IV.,"years previously it did mean, a tendency to exalt privilege as against"
1665,IV.,the general liberties and to court foreign interference in the affairs
1666,IV.,"of Florence, it was the Blacks and not the Whites who had served"
1667,IV.,themselves heirs to Ghibelinism. That the appeal was now taken to the
1668,IV.,Pope instead of to the Emperor did not matter; or that French soldiers
1669,IV.,in place of German were called in to settle domestic differences.
1670,IV.,
1671,IV.,"The Roman See was at this time filled by Boniface VIII., who six years"
1672,IV.,"previously, by violence and fraud, had procured the resignation of"
1673,IV.,Celestine V.--him who made the great refusal.[82] Boniface was at once
1674,IV.,"arrogant and subtle, wholly faithless, and hampered by no scruple"
1675,IV.,either of religion or humanity. But these qualities were too common
1676,IV.,"among those who before and after him filled the Papal throne, to secure"
1677,IV.,him in a special infamy. That he has won from the ruthless hatred which
1678,IV.,"blazes out against him in many a verse of Dante's,[83] and for this"
1679,IV.,"hatred he is indebted to his interference in the affairs of Florence,"
1680,IV.,and what came as one of the fruits of it--the poet's exile.
1681,IV.,
1682,IV.,"And yet, from the point of view not only of the interest of Rome but"
1683,IV.,"also of Italy, there is much to be said for the policy of Boniface."
1684,IV.,"German domination was a just subject of fear, and the Imperialist"
1685,IV.,"element was still so strong in Northern and Central Italy, that if the"
1686,IV.,"Emperor Albert[84] had been a man of a more resolute ambition, he"
1687,IV.,might--so contemporaries deemed--have conquered Italy at the cost of a
1688,IV.,march through it. The cities of Romagna were already in Ghibeline
1689,IV.,"revolt, and it was natural that the Pope should seek to secure Florence"
1690,IV.,on the Papal side. It was for the Florentines rather than for him to
1691,IV.,judge what they would lose or gain by being dragged into the current of
1692,IV.,general politics. He made a fair beginning with an attempt to reconcile
1693,IV.,"the two parties. The Whites were then the dominant faction, and to them"
1694,IV.,reconciliation meant that their foes would at once divide the
1695,IV.,"government with them, and at the long-run sap the popular liberties,"
1696,IV.,while the Pope's hand would soon be allowed to dip freely into the
1697,IV.,communal purse. The policy of the Whites was therefore one of steady
1698,IV.,opposition to all foreign meddling with Florence. But it failed to
1699,IV.,"secure general support, for without being Ghibeline in fact it had the"
1700,IV.,air of being so; and the name of Ghibeline was one that no reasoning
1701,IV.,could rob of its terrors.[85]
1702,IV.,
1703,IV.,"As was usual in Florence when political feeling ran high, the hotter"
1704,IV.,"partisans came to blows, and the streets were more than once disturbed"
1705,IV.,by violence and bloodshed. To an onlooker it must have seemed as if the
1706,IV.,interposition of some external authority was desirable; and almost on
1707,IV.,"the same day as the new Priors, of whom Dante was one and who were all"
1708,IV.,"Whites, took office in the June of 1300, the Cardinal Acquasparta"
1709,IV.,"entered the city, deputed by the Pope to establish peace. His proposals"
1710,IV.,"were declined by the party in power, and having failed in his mission he"
1711,IV.,"left the city, and took the priestly revenge upon it of placing it under"
1712,IV.,"interdict.[86] Ere many months were passed, the Blacks, at a meeting of"
1713,IV.,"the heads of the party, resolved to open negotiations anew with"
1714,IV.,"Boniface. For this illegal step some of them, including Corso Donati,"
1715,IV.,"were ordered into exile by the authorities, who, to give an appearance"
1716,IV.,"of impartiality to their proceedings, at the same time banished some of"
1717,IV.,"the Whites, and among them Guido Cavalcanti. It was afterwards made a"
1718,IV.,charge against Dante that he had procured the recall of his friend Guido
1719,IV.,and the other Whites from exile; but to this he could answer that he was
1720,IV.,not then in office.[87] Corso in the meantime was using his enforced
1721,IV.,absence from Florence to treat freely with the Pope.
1722,IV.,
1723,IV.,"Boniface had already entered into correspondence with Charles of Valois,"
1724,IV.,"brother of Philip, the reigning King of France, with the view of"
1725,IV.,securing the services of a strongly-connected champion. It was the game
1726,IV.,that had been played before by the Roman Court when Charles of Anjou was
1727,IV.,called to Italy to crush the Hohenstaufens. This second Charles was a
1728,IV.,"man of ability of a sort, as he had given cruel proof in his brother's"
1729,IV.,"Flemish wars. By the death of his wife, daughter of his kinsman Charles"
1730,IV.,"II. of Naples and so grand-daughter of Charles of Anjou, he had lost the"
1731,IV.,"dominions of Maine and Anjou, and had got the nickname of Lackland from"
1732,IV.,"his want of a kingdom. He lent a willing ear to Boniface, who presented"
1733,IV.,him with the crown of Sicily on condition that he first wrested it from
1734,IV.,the Spaniard who wore it.[88] All the Papal influence was exerted to get
1735,IV.,money for the expenses of the descent on Sicily. Even churchmen were
1736,IV.,"required to contribute, for it was a holy war, and the hope was that"
1737,IV.,"when Charles, the champion of the Church, had reduced Italy to"
1738,IV.,"obedience, won Sicily for himself by arms, and perhaps the Eastern"
1739,IV.,"Empire by marriage, he would win the Holy Sepulchre for Christendom."
1740,IV.,
1741,IV.,"Charles crossed the Alps in August 1301, with five hundred men-at-arms,"
1742,IV.,"and, avoiding Florence on his southward march, found Boniface at his"
1743,IV.,"favourite residence of Anagni. He was created Pacificator of Tuscany,"
1744,IV.,and loaded with other honours. What better served the purpose of his
1745,IV.,"ambition, he was urged to retrace his steps and justify his new title by"
1746,IV.,"restoring peace to Florence. There the Whites were still in power, but"
1747,IV.,they dared not declare themselves openly hostile to the Papal and Guelf
1748,IV.,interest by refusing him admission to the city. He came with gentle
1749,IV.,"words, and ready to take the most stringent oaths not to tamper with the"
1750,IV.,liberties of the Commonwealth; but once he had gained an entrance
1751,IV.,"(November 1301) and secured his hold on Florence, he threw off every"
1752,IV.,"disguise, gave full play to his avarice, and amused himself with looking"
1753,IV.,on at the pillage of the dwellings and warehouses of the Whites by the
1754,IV.,"party of Corso Donati. By all this, says Dante, Charles 'gained no"
1755,IV.,"land,' Lackland as he was, 'but only sin and shame.'[89]"
1756,IV.,
1757,IV.,There is a want of precise information as to the events of this time.
1758,IV.,But it seems probable that Dante formed one of an embassy sent by the
1759,IV.,rulers of Florence to the Pope in the autumn of this year; and that on
1760,IV.,the occasion of the entrance of Charles he was absent from Florence.
1761,IV.,What the embassy had to propose which Boniface could be expected to be
1762,IV.,"satisfied with, short of complete submission, is not known and is not"
1763,IV.,easy to guess. It seems clear at least that Dante cannot have been
1764,IV.,chosen as a person likely to be specially pleasing to the Roman Court.
1765,IV.,Within the two years preceding he had made himself prominent in the
1766,IV.,"various Councils of which he was a member, by his sturdy opposition to"
1767,IV.,affording aid to the Pope in his Romagnese wars. It is even possible
1768,IV.,that his theory of the Empire was already more or less known to
1769,IV.,"Boniface, and as that Pontiff claimed Imperial authority over such"
1770,IV.,"states as Florence, this would be sufficient to secure him a rough"
1771,IV.,reception.[90] Where he was when the terrible news came to him that for
1772,IV.,"some days there had been no law in Florence, and that Corso Donati was"
1773,IV.,"sharing in the triumph of Charles, we do not know. Presageful of worse"
1774,IV.,"things to come, he did not seek to return, and is said to have been in"
1775,IV.,"Siena when he heard that, on the 27th January 1302, he had been"
1776,IV.,sentenced to a heavy fine and political disabilities for having been
1777,IV.,"guilty of extortion while a Prior, of opposing the coming of Charles,"
1778,IV.,and of crimes against the peace of Florence and the interest of the
1779,IV.,_Parte Guelfa_. If the fine was not paid within three days his goods and
1780,IV.,property were to be confiscated. This condemnation he shared with three
1781,IV.,"others. In the following March he was one of twelve condemned, for"
1782,IV.,"contumacy, to be burned alive if ever they fell into the hands of the"
1783,IV.,"Florentine authorities. We may perhaps assume that the cruel sentence,"
1784,IV.,"as well as the charge of peculation, was uttered only in order to"
1785,IV.,conform to some respectable precedents.
1786,IV.,
1787,IV.,
1788,V.,V.
1789,V.,
1790,V.,Besides Dante many other Whites had been expelled from Florence.[91]
1791,V.,"Whether they liked it or not, they were forced to seek aid from the"
1792,V.,Ghibelines of Arezzo and Romagna. This led naturally to a change of
1793,V.,"political views, and though at the time of their banishment all of them"
1794,V.,"were Guelfs in various degrees, as months and years went on they"
1795,V.,"developed into Ghibelines, more or less declared. Dissensions, too,"
1796,V.,"would be bred among them out of recriminations touching the past, and"
1797,V.,charges of deserting the general interest for the sake of securing
1798,V.,private advantage in the way of making peace with the Republic. For a
1799,V.,"time, however, the common desire of gaining a return to Florence held"
1800,V.,"them together. Of the Council constituted to bring this about, Dante was"
1801,V.,a member. Once only with his associates does he appear to have come the
1802,V.,length of formal negotiations with a view to getting back. Charles of
1803,V.,Valois had passed away from the temporary scene of his extortions and
1804,V.,"treachery, upon the futile quest of a crown. Boniface, ere being"
1805,V.,"persecuted to death by his old ally, Philip of France (1303), had vainly"
1806,V.,"attempted to check the cruelty of the Blacks; and Benedict, his"
1807,V.,"successor, sent the Cardinal of Ostia to Florence with powers to"
1808,V.,reconcile the two parties. Dante is usually credited with the
1809,V.,composition of the letter in which Vieri dei Cerchi and his
1810,V.,fellow-exiles answered the call of the Cardinal to discuss the
1811,V.,conditions of their return home. All that had been done by the banished
1812,V.,"party, said the letter, had been done for the public good.[92] The"
1813,V.,negotiations came to nothing; nor were the exiles more fortunate in
1814,V.,arms. Along with their allies they did once succeed by a sudden dash in
1815,V.,"penetrating to the market-place, and Florence lay within their grasp"
1816,V.,"when, seized with panic, they turned and fled from the city, which many"
1817,V.,of them were never to see again.
1818,V.,
1819,V.,"Almost certainly Dante took no active part in this attempt, and indeed"
1820,V.,there is little to show that he was ever heartily associated with the
1821,V.,"exiles. In his own words, he was compelled to break with his companions"
1822,V.,"owing to their imbecility and wickedness, and to form a party by"
1823,V.,"himself.[93] With the Whites, then, he had little more to do; and the"
1824,V.,story of their fortunes need not longer detain us. It is enough to say
1825,V.,"that while, like Dante, the chief men among them were for ever excluded"
1826,V.,"from Florence, the principles for which they had contended survived, and"
1827,V.,even obtained something like a triumph within its walls. The success of
1828,V.,"Donati and his party, though won with the help of the people, was too"
1829,V.,clearly opposed to the popular interest to be permanent. Ere long the
1830,V.,inveterate contradiction between magnate and merchant was again to
1831,V.,change the course of Florentine politics; the disabilities against
1832,V.,lawless nobles were again to be enforced; and Corso Donati himself was
1833,V.,to be crushed in the collision of passions he had evoked but could not
1834,V.,"control (1308). Though tenderly attached to members of his family, Dante"
1835,V.,bore Corso a grudge as having been the chief agent in procuring his
1836,V.,exile--a grudge which years could do nothing to wipe out. He places in
1837,V.,the mouth of Forese Donati a prophecy of the great Baron's shameful
1838,V.,"death, expressed in curt and scornful words, terrible from a"
1839,V.,brother.[94] It is no figure of speech to say that Dante nursed revenge.
1840,V.,
1841,V.,"For some few years his hopes were set on Henry of Luxemburg, elected"
1842,V.,"Emperor in 1308. A Ghibeline, in the ordinary sense of the term, Dante"
1843,V.,never was. We have in his _De Monarchia_ a full account of the
1844,V.,conception he had formed of the Empire--that of authority in temporal
1845,V.,"affairs embodied in a just ruler, who, being already supreme, would be"
1846,V.,delivered from all personal ambition; who should decree justice and be a
1847,V.,refuge for all that were oppressed. He was to be the captain of
1848,V.,Christian society and the guardian of civil right; as in another sphere
1849,V.,the Pope was to be the shepherd of souls and the guardian of the deposit
1850,V.,of Divine truth. In Dante's eyes the one great officer was as much God's
1851,V.,vicegerent as the other. While the most that a Ghibeline or a moderate
1852,V.,Guelf would concede was that there should be a division of power between
1853,V.,Pope and Emperor--the Ghibeline leaving it to the Emperor and the Guelf
1854,V.,"to the Pope to define their provinces--Dante held, and in this he stood"
1855,V.,"almost alone among politicians, that they ought to be concerned with"
1856,V.,"wholly different kingdoms, and that Christendom was wronged by the"
1857,V.,trespass of either upon the other's domain. An equal wrong was done by
1858,V.,"the neglect by either of his duty, and both, as Dante judged, had been"
1859,V.,shamefully neglecting it. For more than half a century no Emperor had
1860,V.,set foot in Italy; and since the Papal Court had under Clement V. been
1861,V.,"removed to Avignon (1305), the Pope had ceased to be a free agent, owing"
1862,V.,to his neighbourhood to France and the unscrupulous Philip.[95]
1863,V.,
1864,V.,Dante trusted that the virtuous single-minded Henry VII. would prove a
1865,V.,monarch round whom all the best in Italy might gather to make him
1866,V.,Emperor in deed as well as in name. His judgment took the colour of his
1867,V.,"hopes, for under the awful shadow of the Emperor he trusted to enter"
1868,V.,"Florence. Although no Ghibeline or Imperialist in the vulgar sense, he"
1869,V.,constituted himself Henry's apologist and herald; and in letters
1870,V.,"addressed to the 'wicked Florentines,' to the Emperor, and to the"
1871,V.,"Princes and Peoples of Italy, he blew as it were a trumpet-blast of"
1872,V.,triumph over the Emperor's enemies and his own. Henry had crossed the
1873,V.,"Alps, and was tarrying in the north of Italy, when Dante, with a keen"
1874,V.,"eye for where the key of the situation lay, sharpened by his own wishes,"
1875,V.,urged him to lose no more time in reducing the Lombard cities to
1876,V.,"obedience, but to descend on Florence, the rotten sheep which was"
1877,V.,corrupting all the Italian flock. The men of Florence he bids prepare to
1878,V.,receive the just reward of their crimes.
1879,V.,
1880,V.,The Florentines answered Dante's bitter invective and the Emperor's
1881,V.,milder promises by an unwearied opposition with the arms which their
1882,V.,increasing command of all that tends to soften life made them now less
1883,V.,"willing to take up, and by the diplomacy in which they were supreme The"
1884,V.,"exiles were recalled, always excepting the more stubborn or dangerous;"
1885,V.,"and among these was reckoned Dante. Alliances were made on all hands, an"
1886,V.,art which Henry was notably wanting in the trick of. Wherever he turned
1887,V.,"he was met and checkmated by the Florentines, who, wise by experience,"
1888,V.,were set on retaining control of their own affairs. After his coronation
1889,V.,"at Rome (1312),[96] he marched northwards, and with his Pisan and"
1890,V.,Aretine allies for six weeks laid fruitless siege to Florence. King
1891,V.,"Robert of Naples, whose aid he had hoped to gain by means of a family"
1892,V.,"alliance, was joined to the league of Guelfs, and Henry passed away from"
1893,V.,"Florence to engage in an enterprise against the Southern Kingdom, a"
1894,V.,design cut short by his death (1313). He was the last Emperor that ever
1895,V.,sought to take the part in Italian affairs which on Dante's theory
1896,V.,"belonged to the Imperial office. Well-meaning but weak, he was not the"
1897,V.,man to succeed in reducing to practice a scheme of government which had
1898,V.,"broken down even in the strong hands of the two Fredericks, and ere the"
1899,V.,Commonwealths of Italy had become each as powerful as a Northern
1900,V.,"kingdom. To explain his failure, Dante finds that his descent into Italy"
1901,V.,"was unseasonable: he came too soon. Rather, it may be said, he came far"
1902,V.,too late.[97]
1903,V.,
1904,V.,"When, on the death of Henry, Dante was disappointed in his hopes of a"
1905,V.,"true revival of the Empire, he devoted himself for a time to urging the"
1906,V.,"restoration of the Papal Court to Rome, so that Italy might at least not"
1907,V.,be left without some centre of authority. In a letter addressed to the
1908,V.,"Italian Cardinals, he besought them to replace Clement V., who died in"
1909,V.,"1314,[98] by an Italian Pope. Why should they, he asked, resign this"
1910,V.,"great office into Gascon hands? Why should Rome, the true centre of"
1911,V.,"Christendom, be left deserted and despised? His appeal was fruitless, as"
1912,V.,indeed it could not fail to be with only six Italian Cardinals in a
1913,V.,College of twenty-four; and after a vacancy of two years the Gascon
1914,V.,Clement was succeeded by another Gascon. Although Dante's motives in
1915,V.,making this attempt were doubtless as purely patriotic as those which
1916,V.,"inspired Catherine of Siena to similar action a century later, he met,"
1917,V.,"we may be sure, with but little sympathy from his former"
1918,V.,"fellow-citizens. They were intent upon the interests of Florence alone,"
1919,V.,and even of these they may sometimes have taken a narrow view. His was
1920,V.,"the wider patriotism of the Italian, and it was the whole Peninsula"
1921,V.,that he longed to see delivered from French influence and once more
1922,V.,"provided with a seat of authority in its midst, even if it were only"
1923,V.,"that of spiritual power. The Florentines for their part, desirous of"
1924,V.,"security against the incursions of the northern horde, were rather set"
1925,V.,on retaining the goodwill of France than on enjoying the neighbourhood
1926,V.,of the Pope. In this they were guilty of no desertion of their
1927,V.,principles. Their Guelfism had never been more than a mode of minding
1928,V.,themselves.
1929,V.,
1930,V.,For about three years (1313-1316) the most dangerous foe of Florence was
1931,V.,"Uguccione de la Faggiuola, a partisan Ghibeline chief, sprung from the"
1932,V.,"mountain-land of Urbino, which lies between Tuscany and Romagna. He made"
1933,V.,"himself lord of Pisa and Lucca, and defeated the Florentines and their"
1934,V.,allies in the great battle of Montecatini (1315). To him Dante is
1935,V.,believed to have attached himself.[99] It would be easy for the Republic
1936,V.,to form an exaggerated idea of the part which the exile had in shaping
1937,V.,the policy or contributing to the success of his patron; and we are not
1938,V.,"surprised to find that, although Dante's fighting days were done, he was"
1939,V.,after the defeat subjected to a third condemnation (November 1315). If
1940,V.,"caught, he was to lose his head; and his sons, or some of them, were"
1941,V.,threatened with the same fate. The terms of the sentence may again have
1942,V.,been more severe than the intentions of those who uttered it. However
1943,V.,"this may be, an amnesty was passed in the course of the following year,"
1944,V.,and Dante was urged to take advantage of it. He found the conditions of
1945,V.,"pardon too humiliating. Like a malefactor he would require to walk,"
1946,V.,"taper in hand and a shameful mitre on his head, to the church of St"
1947,V.,"John, and there make an oblation for his crimes. It was not in this"
1948,V.,fashion that in his more hopeful hours the exile had imagined his
1949,V.,restoration. If ever he trod again the pavement of his beautiful St
1950,V.,"John's, it was to be proudly, as a patriot touching whom his country had"
1951,V.,"confessed her sins; or, with a poet's more bashful pride, to receive the"
1952,V.,laurel crown beside the font in which he was baptized. But as he would
1953,V.,"not enter his well beloved, well hated Florence on the terms imposed by"
1954,V.,"his enemies, so he never had the chance of entering it on his own. The"
1955,V.,"spirit in which he, as it were, turned from the open gates of his native"
1956,V.,"town is well expressed in a letter to a friend, who would seem to have"
1957,V.,been a churchman who had tried to win his compliance with the terms of
1958,V.,the pardon. After thanking his correspondent for his kindly eagerness to
1959,V.,"recover him, and referring to the submission required, he says:--'And is"
1960,V.,"it in this glorious fashion that Dante Alighieri, wearied with an almost"
1961,V.,"trilustral exile, is recalled to his country? Is this the desert of an"
1962,V.,"innocence known to all, and of laborious study which for long has kept"
1963,V.,"him asweat?... But, Father, this is no way for me to return to my"
1964,V.,country by; though if by you or others one can be hit upon through which
1965,V.,"the honour and fame of Dante will take no hurt, it shall be followed by"
1966,V.,"me with no tardy steps. If by none such Florence is to be entered, I"
1967,V.,"will never enter Florence. What then! Can I not, wherever I may be,"
1968,V.,behold the sun and stars? Is not meditation upon the sweetness of truth
1969,V.,"as free to me in one place as another? To enjoy this, no need to submit"
1970,V.,myself ingloriously and with ignominy to the State and People of
1971,V.,"Florence! And wherever I may be thrown, in any case I trust at least to"
1972,V.,find daily bread.'
1973,V.,
1974,V.,The cruelty and injustice of Florence to her greatest son have been the
1975,V.,"subject of much eloquent blame. But, in justice to his contemporaries,"
1976,V.,"we must try to see Dante as they saw him, and bear in mind that the very"
1977,V.,qualities fame makes so much of--his fervent temper and devotion to
1978,V.,great ideas--placed him out of the reach of common sympathy. Others
1979,V.,"besides him had been banished from Florence, with as much or as little"
1980,V.,"reason, and had known the saltness of bread which has been begged, and"
1981,V.,the steepness of strange stairs. The pains of banishment made them the
1982,V.,more eager to have it brought to a close. With Dante all that he
1983,V.,suffered went to swell the count of grievances for which a reckoning was
1984,V.,"some day to be exacted. The art of returning was, as he himself knew"
1985,V.,"well, one he was slow to learn.[100] His noble obstinacy, which would"
1986,V.,"stoop to no loss of dignity or sacrifice of principle, must excite our"
1987,V.,admiration; it also goes far to account for his difficulty in getting
1988,V.,back. We can even imagine that in Florence his refusal to abate one
1989,V.,"tittle of what was due to him in the way of apology was, for a time, the"
1990,V.,"subject of wondering speculation to the citizens, ere they turned again"
1991,V.,to their everyday affairs of politics and merchandise. Had they been
1992,V.,more used to deal with men in whom a great genius was allied to a
1993,V.,"stubborn sense of honour, they would certainly have left less room in"
1994,V.,their treatment of Dante for happier ages to cavil at.
1995,V.,
1996,V.,"How did the case stand? In the letter above quoted from, Dante says that"
1997,V.,his innocence was known to all. As far as the charge of corruption in
1998,V.,"his office-bearing went, his banishment--no one can doubt it for a"
1999,V.,moment--was certainly unjust; and the political changes in Florence
2000,V.,since the death of Corso Donati had taken all the life out of the other
2001,V.,charges. But by his eager appeals to the Emperor to chastise the
2002,V.,Florentines he had raised fresh barriers against his return. The
2003,V.,governors of the Republic could not be expected to adopt his theory of
2004,V.,the Empire and share his views of the Imperial claims; and to them Dante
2005,V.,must have seemed as much guilty of disloyalty to the Commonwealth in
2006,V.,"inviting the presence of Henry, as Corso Donati had been in Dante's eyes"
2007,V.,for his share in bringing Charles of Valois to harry Florence. His
2008,V.,political writings since his exile--and all his writings were more or
2009,V.,less political--had been such as might well confirm or create an opinion
2010,V.,"of him as a man difficult to live with, as one whose intellectual"
2011,V.,arrogance had a ready organ in his unsparing tongue or pen. Rumour
2012,V.,would most willingly dwell upon and distort the features of his
2013,V.,character and conduct that separated him from the common herd. And to
2014,V.,"add to all this, even after he had deserted the party of the Whites in"
2015,V.,"exile, and had become a party to himself, he found his friends and"
2016,V.,patrons--for where else could he find them?--among the foes of Florence.
2017,V.,
2018,V.,
2019,VI.,VI.
2020,VI.,
2021,VI.,History never abhors a vacuum so much as when she has to deal with the
2022,VI.,"life of a great man, and for those who must have details of Dante's"
2023,VI.,career during the nineteen years which elapsed between his banishment
2024,VI.,"and his death, the industry of his biographers has exhausted every"
2025,VI.,"available hint, while some of them press into their service much that"
2026,VI.,has only the remotest bearing on their hero. If even one-half of their
2027,VI.,"suppositions were adopted, we should be forced to the conclusion that"
2028,VI.,the _Comedy_ and all the other works of his exile were composed in the
2029,VI.,"intervals of a very busy life. We have his own word for this much,"
2030,VI.,"(_Convito_ i. 3,) that since he was cast forth out of Florence--in which"
2031,VI.,he would 'fain rest his wearied soul and fulfil his appointed time'--he
2032,VI.,"had been 'a pilgrim, nay, even a mendicant,' in every quarter of"
2033,VI.,"Italy,[101] and had 'been held cheap by many who, because of his fame,"
2034,VI.,had looked to find him come in another guise.' But he gives no journal
2035,VI.,"of his wanderings, and, as will have been observed, says no word of any"
2036,VI.,"country but Italy. Keeping close to well-ascertained facts, it seems"
2037,VI.,established that in the earlier period of his exile he sojourned with
2038,VI.,"members of the great family of the Counts Guidi,[102] and that he also"
2039,VI.,"found hospitality with the Malaspini,[103] lords of the Val di Magra,"
2040,VI.,between Genoa and Lucca. At a still earlier date (August 1306) he is
2041,VI.,found witnessing a deed in Padua. It was most probably in the same year
2042,VI.,"that Dante found Giotto there, painting the walls of the Scrovegni"
2043,VI.,"Chapel, and was courteously welcomed by the artist, and taken to his"
2044,VI.,house.[104] At some time of his life he studied at Bologna: John Villani
2045,VI.,"says, during his exile.[105] Of his supposed residence in Paris, though"
2046,VI.,"it is highly probable, there is a want of proof; of a visit to England,"
2047,VI.,none at all that is worth a moment's consideration. Some of his
2048,VI.,commentators and biographers seem to think he was so short-witted that
2049,VI.,he must have been in a place before it could occur to him to name it in
2050,VI.,his verse.
2051,VI.,
2052,VI.,We have Dante's own word for it that he found his exile almost
2053,VI.,intolerable. Besides the bitter resentment which he felt at the
2054,VI.,"injustice of it, he probably cherished the conviction that his career"
2055,VI.,had been cut short when he was on the point of acquiring great influence
2056,VI.,in affairs. The illusion may have been his--one not uncommon among men
2057,VI.,"of a powerful imagination--that, given only due opportunity, he could"
2058,VI.,mould the active life of his time as easily as he moulded and fashioned
2059,VI.,"the creations of his fancy. It was, perhaps, owing to no fault of his"
2060,VI.,"own that when a partial opportunity had offered itself, he failed to get"
2061,VI.,"his views adopted in Florence; indeed, to judge from the kind of"
2062,VI.,"employment in which he was more than once engaged for his patrons, he"
2063,VI.,"must have been possessed of no little business tact. Yet, as when his"
2064,VI.,"feelings were deeply concerned his words knew no restraint, so his hopes"
2065,VI.,"would partake of the largeness of his genius. In the restored Empire,"
2066,VI.,"which he was almost alone in longing for as he conceived of it, he may"
2067,VI.,have imagined for himself a place beside Henry like what in Frederick's
2068,VI.,court had been filled by Pier delle Vigne--the man who held both keys to
2069,VI.,"the Emperor's heart, and opened and shut it as he would.[106]"
2070,VI.,
2071,VI.,"Thus, as his exile ran on it would grow sadder with the accumulating"
2072,VI.,"memories of hopes deferred and then destroyed, and of dreams which had"
2073,VI.,faded away in the light of a cheerless reality. But some consolations he
2074,VI.,must have found even in the conditions of his exile. He had leisure for
2075,VI.,"meditation, and time enough to spend in that other world which was all"
2076,VI.,his own. With the miseries of a wanderer's life would come not a few of
2077,VI.,"its sweets--freedom from routine, and the intellectual stimulus supplied"
2078,VI.,by change of place. Here and there he would find society such as he
2079,VI.,"cared for--that of scholars, theologians, and men familiar with every"
2080,VI.,"court and school of Christendom. And, beyond all, he would get access to"
2081,VI.,books that at home he might never have seen. It was no spare diet that
2082,VI.,would serve his mind while he was making such ample calls on it for his
2083,VI.,great work. As it proceeds we seem to detect a growing fulness of
2084,VI.,"knowledge, and it is by reason of the more learned treatment, as well as"
2085,VI.,"the loftier theme of the Third Cantica, that so many readers, when once"
2086,VI.,"well at sea in the _Paradiso_, recognise the force of the warning with"
2087,VI.,which it begins.[107]
2088,VI.,
2089,VI.,What amount of intercourse he was able to maintain with Florence during
2090,VI.,"his wanderings is a matter of mere speculation, although of a more"
2091,VI.,interesting kind than that concerned with the chronology of his uneasy
2092,VI.,travels. That he kept up at least some correspondence with his friends
2093,VI.,is proved by the letter regarding the terms of his pardon. There is also
2094,VI.,the well-known anecdote told by Boccaccio as to the discovery and
2095,VI.,despatch to him of the opening Cantos of the _Inferno_--an anecdote we
2096,VI.,"may safely accept as founded on fact, although Boccaccio's informants"
2097,VI.,"may have failed to note at the time what the manuscript consisted of,"
2098,VI.,and in the course of years may have magnified the importance of their
2099,VI.,discovery. With his wife he would naturally communicate on subjects of
2100,VI.,"common interest--as, for instance, that of how best to save or recover"
2101,VI.,"part of his property--and especially regarding the welfare of his sons,"
2102,VI.,of whom two are found to be with him when he acquires something like a
2103,VI.,settlement in Verona.
2104,VI.,
2105,VI.,"It is quite credible that, as Boccaccio asserts, he would never after"
2106,VI.,his exile was once begun 'go to his wife or suffer her to join him where
2107,VI.,he was;' although the statement is probably an extension of the fact
2108,VI.,that she never did join him. In any case it is to make too large a use
2109,VI.,"of the words to find in them evidence, as has frequently been done, of"
2110,VI.,"the unhappiness of all his married life, and of his utter estrangement"
2111,VI.,from Gemma during his banishment. The union--marriage of convenience
2112,VI.,though it was--might be harmonious enough as long as things went
2113,VI.,"moderately well with the pair. Dante was never wealthy, but he seems to"
2114,VI.,have had his own house in Florence and small landed possessions in its
2115,VI.,neighbourhood.[108] That before his banishment he was considerably in
2116,VI.,"debt appears to be ascertained;[109] but, without knowing the"
2117,VI.,"circumstances in which he borrowed, it is impossible to be sure whether"
2118,VI.,he may not only have been making use of his credit in order to put out
2119,VI.,part of his means to advantage in some of the numerous commercial
2120,VI.,enterprises in which his neighbours were engaged. In any case his career
2121,VI.,must have seemed full of promise till he was driven into banishment.
2122,VI.,"When that blow had fallen, it is easy to conceive how what if it was not"
2123,VI.,mutual affection had come to serve instead of it--esteem and
2124,VI.,forbearance--would be changed into indifference with the lapse of months
2125,VI.,"and years of enforced separation, embittered and filled on both sides"
2126,VI.,"with the mean cares of indigence, and, it may be, on Gemma's side with"
2127,VI.,the conviction that her husband had brought her with himself into
2128,VI.,disgrace. If all that is said by Boccaccio and some of Dante's enemies
2129,VI.,"as to his temperament and behaviour were true, we could only hope that"
2130,VI.,Gemma's indifference was deep enough to save her from the pangs of
2131,VI.,"jealousy. And on the other hand, if we are to push suspicion to its"
2132,VI.,"utmost length, we may find an allusion to his own experience in the"
2133,VI.,lines where Dante complains of how soon a widow forgets her
2134,VI.,husband.[110] But this is all matter of the merest speculation. Gemma
2135,VI.,"is known to have been alive in 1314.[111] She brought up her children,"
2136,VI.,"says Boccaccio, upon a trifling part of her husband's confiscated"
2137,VI.,"estate, recovered on the plea that it was a portion of her dowry. There"
2138,VI.,"may have been difficulties of a material kind, insuperable save to an"
2139,VI.,"ardent love that was not theirs, in the way of Gemma's joining her"
2140,VI.,husband in any of his cities of refuge.
2141,VI.,
2142,VI.,Complete evidence exists of Dante's having in his later years lived for
2143,VI.,"a longer or shorter time in the three cities of Lucca, Verona, and"
2144,VI.,"Ravenna. In Purgatory he meets a shade from Lucca, in the murmur of"
2145,VI.,whose words he catches he 'knows not what of Gentucca;'[112] and when he
2146,VI.,"charges the Lucchese to speak plainly out, he is told that Lucca shall"
2147,VI.,yet be found pleasant by him because of a girl not yet grown to
2148,VI.,"womanhood. Uguccione, acting in the interest of Pisa, took possession of"
2149,VI.,"Lucca in 1314, and Dante is supposed to have taken up his residence"
2150,VI.,there for some considerable time. What we may certainly infer from his
2151,VI.,own words in the _Purgatorio_ is that they were written after a stay in
2152,VI.,Lucca had been sweetened to him by the society of a lady named Gentucca.
2153,VI.,He cannot well have found shelter there before the city was held by
2154,VI.,Uguccione; and research has established that at least two ladies of the
2155,VI.,uncommon name of Gentucca were resident there in 1314. From the whole
2156,VI.,tone of his allusion--the mention of her very name and of her innocent
2157,VI.,girlhood--we may gather that there was nothing in his liking for her of
2158,VI.,which he had any reason to feel ashamed. In the _Inferno_ he had covered
2159,VI.,the whole people of Lucca with his scorn.[113] By the time he got thus
2160,VI.,far with the _Purgatorio_ his thoughts of the place were all softened by
2161,VI.,"his memory of one fair face--or shall we rather say, of one"
2162,VI.,compassionate and womanly soul? That Dante was more than susceptible to
2163,VI.,feminine charms is coarsely asserted by Boccaccio.[114] But on such a
2164,VI.,"matter Boccaccio is a prejudiced witness, and, in the absence of"
2165,VI.,"sufficient proof to the contrary, justice requires us to assume that the"
2166,VI.,tenor of Dante's life was not at variance with that of his writings. He
2167,VI.,"who was so severe a judge of others was not, as we can infer from more"
2168,VI.,"than one passage of the _Comedy_, a lenient judge when his own failings"
2169,VI.,were concerned.[115] That his conduct never fell short of his standard
2170,VI.,"no one will venture to maintain. But what should have hindered him, in"
2171,VI.,his hours of weariness and when even his hold on the future seemed to
2172,VI.,"slacken, in lonely castle or strange town, to seek sympathy from some"
2173,VI.,fair woman who might remind him in something of Beatrice?[116]
2174,VI.,
2175,VI.,"When, in 1316, Uguccione was driven out of Lucca and Pisa, that great"
2176,VI.,partisan took military service with Can Grande. It has been disputed
2177,VI.,"whether Dante had earlier enjoyed the hospitality of the Scaligers, or"
2178,VI.,was indebted for his first reception in Verona to the good offices of
2179,VI.,Uguccione. It is barely credible that by this time in his life he stood
2180,VI.,in need of any one to answer for him in the court of Can Grande. His
2181,VI.,fame as a political writer must have preceded him; and it was of a
2182,VI.,character to commend him to the good graces of the great Imperialist. In
2183,VI.,"his _De Monarchia_ he had, by an exhaustive treatment of propositions"
2184,VI.,which now seem childish or else the mere commonplaces of everyday
2185,VI.,"political argument, established the right of the civil power to"
2186,VI.,independence of Church authority; and though to the Scaliger who aimed
2187,VI.,at becoming Imperial lieutenant for all the North of Italy he might seem
2188,VI.,"needlessly tender to the spiritual lordship of the Holy Father, yet the"
2189,VI.,drift of his reasoning was all in favour of the Ghibeline position.[117]
2190,VI.,Besides this he had written on the need of refining the dialects of
2191,VI.,"Italian, and reducing them to a language fit for general use in the"
2192,VI.,whole of the Peninsula; and this with a novelty of treatment and wealth
2193,VI.,of illustration unequalled before or since in any first work on such a
2194,VI.,"subject.[118] And, what would recommend him still more to a youthful"
2195,VI.,"prince of lofty taste, he was the poet of the 'sweet new style' of the"
2196,VI.,"_Vita Nuova_, and of sonnets, ballads, and canzoni rich in language and"
2197,VI.,thought beyond the works of all previous poets in the vulgar tongues.
2198,VI.,"Add to this that the _Comedy_ was already written, and published up,"
2199,VI.,"perhaps, to the close of the _Purgatorio_, and that all Italy was eager"
2200,VI.,"to find who had a place, and what kind of place, in the strange new"
2201,VI.,world from which the veil was being withdrawn; and it is easy to imagine
2202,VI.,that Dante's reception at Can Grande's court was rather that of a man
2203,VI.,"both admired and feared for his great genius, than that of a wandering"
2204,VI.,scholar and grumbling exile.
2205,VI.,
2206,VI.,"At what time Dante came to Verona, and for how long he stayed, we have"
2207,VI.,no means of fixing with certainty. He himself mentions being there in
2208,VI.,"1320,[119] and it is usually supposed that his residence covered three"
2209,VI.,"years previous to that date; as also that it was shared by his two sons,"
2210,VI.,Piero and Jacopo. One of these was afterwards to find a settlement at
2211,VI.,"Verona in a high legal post. Except some frivolous legends, there is no"
2212,VI.,evidence that Dante met with anything but generous treatment from Can
2213,VI.,"Grande. A passage of the _Paradiso_, written either towards the close of"
2214,VI.,"the poet's residence at Verona, or after he had left it, is full of a"
2215,VI.,praise of the great Scaliger so magnificent[120] as fully to make amends
2216,VI.,for the contemptuous mention in the _Purgatorio_ of his father and
2217,VI.,brother.[121] To Can Grande the _Paradiso_ was dedicated by the author
2218,VI.,in a long epistle containing an exposition of how the first Canto of
2219,VI.,"that Cantica, and, by implication, the whole of the poem, is to be"
2220,VI.,interpreted. The letter is full of gratitude for favours already
2221,VI.,"received, and of expectation of others yet to come. From the terms of"
2222,VI.,the dedication it has been assumed that ere it was made the whole of the
2223,VI.,"_Paradiso_ was written, and that Dante praises the lord of Verona after"
2224,VI.,a long experience of his bounty.[122]
2225,VI.,
2226,VI.,"Whether owing to the restlessness of an exile, or to some prospect of"
2227,VI.,attaining a state of greater ease or of having the command of more
2228,VI.,"congenial society, we cannot tell; but from the splendid court of Can"
2229,VI.,"Grande he moved down into Romagna, to Ravenna, the city which of all in"
2230,VI.,Italy would now be fixed upon by the traveller as the fittest place for
2231,VI.,"a man of genius, weighed down by infinite sorrows, to close his days in"
2232,VI.,and find a tomb. Some writers on the life of Dante will have it that in
2233,VI.,"Ravenna he spent the greater part of his exile, and that when he is"
2234,VI.,found elsewhere--in Lucca or Verona--he is only on a temporary absence
2235,VI.,from his permanent home.[123] But this conclusion requires some facts to
2236,VI.,"be ignored, and others unduly dwelt on. In any case his patron there,"
2237,VI.,"during at least the last year or two of his life, was Guido Novello of"
2238,VI.,"Polenta, lord of Ravenna, the nephew of her who above all the persons of"
2239,VI.,the _Comedy_ lives in the hearts of its readers.
2240,VI.,
2241,VI.,"Bernardino, the brother of Francesca and uncle of Guido, had fought on"
2242,VI.,"the side of Florence at the battle of Campaldino, and Dante may then"
2243,VI.,have become acquainted with him. The family had the reputation of being
2244,VI.,"moderate Guelfs; but ere this the exile, with his ripe experience of"
2245,VI.,"men, had doubtless learned, while retaining intact his own opinions as"
2246,VI.,"to what was the true theory of government, to set good-heartedness and"
2247,VI.,a noble aim in life above political orthodoxy. This Guido Novello--the
2248,VI.,"younger Guido--bears the reputation of having been well-informed, of"
2249,VI.,"gentle manners, and fond of gathering around him men accomplished in"
2250,VI.,literature and the fine arts. On the death of Dante he made a formal
2251,VI.,oration in honour of the poet. If his welcome of Dante was as cordial as
2252,VI.,"is generally supposed, and as there is no reason to doubt that it was,"
2253,VI.,it proved his magnanimity; for in the _Purgatorio_ a family specially
2254,VI.,"hostile to the Polentas had been mentioned with honour,[124] while that"
2255,VI.,to which his wife belonged had been lightly spoken of. How he got over
2256,VI.,the condemnation of his kinswoman to Inferno--even under such gentle
2257,VI.,conditions--it would be more difficult to understand were there not
2258,VI.,reason to believe that ere Dante went to Ravenna it had come to be a
2259,VI.,matter of pride in Italy for a family to have any of its members placed
2260,VI.,anywhere in that other world of which Dante held the key.
2261,VI.,
2262,VI.,It seems as if we might assume that the poet's last months or years were
2263,VI.,soothed by the society of his daughter--the child whom he had named
2264,VI.,after the object of his first and most enduring love.[125] Whether or
2265,VI.,not he was acting as Ambassador for Guido to Venice when he caught his
2266,VI.,"last illness, it appears to be pretty well established that he was held"
2267,VI.,in honour by his patron and all around him.[126] For his hours of
2268,VI.,meditation he had the solemn churches of Ravenna with their storied
2269,VI.,"walls,[127] and the still more solemn pine forest of Classis, by him"
2270,VI.,"first annexed to the world of Romance.[128] For hours of relaxation,"
2271,VI.,"when they came, he had neighbours who dabbled in letters and who could"
2272,VI.,at any rate sympathise with him in his love of study. He maintained
2273,VI.,correspondence with poets and scholars in other cities. In at least one
2274,VI.,instance this was conducted in the bitter fashion with which the
2275,VI.,humanists of a century or two later were to make the world
2276,VI.,"familiar;[129] but with the Bolognese scholar, Giovanni del Virgilio, he"
2277,VI.,"engaged in a good-humoured, half-bantering exchange of Latin pastoral"
2278,VI.,"poems, through the artificial imagery of which there sometimes breaks a"
2279,VI.,"natural thought, as when in answer to the pedant's counsel to renounce"
2280,VI.,the vulgar tongue and produce in Latin something that will entitle him
2281,VI.,"to receive the laurel crown in Bologna, he declares that if ever he is"
2282,VI.,crowned as a poet it will be on the banks of the Arno.
2283,VI.,
2284,VI.,Most of the material for forming a judgment of how Dante stood affected
2285,VI.,to the religious beliefs of his time is to be gathered from the
2286,VI.,"_Comedy_, and the place for considering it would rather be in an essay"
2287,VI.,on that work than in a sketch of his life which necessity compels to be
2288,VI.,"swift. A few words may however be here devoted to the subject, as it is"
2289,VI.,one with some bearing on the manner in which he would be regarded by
2290,VI.,"those around him, and through that on the tenor of his life. That Dante"
2291,VI.,"conformed to Church observances, and, except with a few malevolent"
2292,VI.,"critics, bore the reputation of a good Catholic, there can be no doubt."
2293,VI.,It was as a politician and not as a heretic that he suffered
2294,VI.,persecution; and when he died he was buried in great honour within the
2295,VI.,"Franciscan Church at Ravenna. Some few years after his death, it is"
2296,VI.,"true, his _De Monarchia_ was burned as heretical by orders of the Papal"
2297,VI.,"Legate in Lombardy, who would gladly, if he could, have had the bones of"
2298,VI.,the author exhumed to share the fate of his book. But all this was only
2299,VI.,because the partisans of Lewis of Bavaria were making political capital
2300,VI.,out of the treatise.
2301,VI.,
2302,VI.,Attempts have been made to demonstrate that in spite of his outward
2303,VI.,"conformity Dante was an unbeliever at heart, and that the _Comedy_ is"
2304,VI.,"devoted to the promulgation of a Ghibeline heresy--of which, we may be"
2305,VI.,"sure, no Ghibeline ever heard--and to the overthrow of all that the"
2306,VI.,author professed most devoutly to believe.[130] Other critics of a more
2307,VI.,sober temper in speculation would find in him a Catholic who held the
2308,VI.,Catholic beliefs with the same slack grasp as the teaching of Luther was
2309,VI.,held by Lessing or Goethe.[131] But this is surely to misread the
2310,VI.,"_Comedy_, which is steeped from beginning to end in a spirit of the"
2311,VI.,warmest faith in the great Christian doctrines. It was no mere
2312,VI.,intellectual perception of these that Dante had--or professed to
2313,VI.,have--for when in Paradise he has satisfied Saint Peter of his being
2314,VI.,"possessed of a just conception of the nature of faith, and is next asked"
2315,VI.,"if, besides knowing what is the alloy of the coin and the weight of it,"
2316,VI.,"he has it in his own purse, he answers boldly, 'Yea, and so shining and"
2317,VI.,"round that of a surety it has the lawful stamp.'[132] And further on,"
2318,VI.,"when required to declare in what he believes, nothing against the"
2319,VI.,fulness of his creed is to be inferred from the fact that he stops short
2320,VI.,after pronouncing his belief in the existence of God and in the Trinity.
2321,VI.,This article he gives as implying all the others; it is 'the spark which
2322,VI.,spreads out into a vivid flame.'[133]
2323,VI.,
2324,VI.,"Yet if the inquiry were to be pushed further, and it were sought to find"
2325,VI.,"how much of free thought he allowed himself in matters of religion,"
2326,VI.,Dante might be discovered to have reached his orthodox position by ways
2327,VI.,hateful to the bigots who then took order for preserving the purity of
2328,VI.,"the faith. The office of the Pope he deeply revered, but the Papal"
2329,VI.,absolution avails nothing in his eyes compared with one tear of
2330,VI.,heartfelt repentance.[134] It is not on the word of Pope or Council that
2331,VI.,"he rests his faith, but on the Scriptures, and on the evidences of the"
2332,VI.,"truth of Christianity, freely examined and weighed.[135] Chief among"
2333,VI.,"these evidences, it must however be noted, he esteemed the fact of the"
2334,VI.,existence of the Church as he found it;[136] and in his inquiries he
2335,VI.,accepted as guides the Scholastic Doctors on whose reasonings the Church
2336,VI.,had set its seal of approbation. It was a foregone conclusion he reached
2337,VI.,by stages of his own. Yet that he sympathised at least as much with the
2338,VI.,"honest search for truth as with the arrogant profession of orthodoxy, is"
2339,VI.,shown by his treatment of heretics. He could not condemn severely such
2340,VI.,as erred only because their reason would not consent to rest like his in
2341,VI.,the prevalent dogmatic system; and so we find that he makes heresy
2342,VI.,consist less in intellectual error than in beliefs that tend to vitiate
2343,VI.,"conduct, or to cause schism in societies divinely constituted.[137] For"
2344,VI.,"his own part, orthodox although he was, or believed himself to be--which"
2345,VI.,"is all that needs to be contended for,--in no sense was he"
2346,VI.,priest-ridden. It was liberty that he went seeking on his great
2347,VI.,journey;[138] and he gives no hint that it is to be gained by the
2348,VI.,observance of forms or in submission to sacerdotal authority. He knows
2349,VI.,"it is in his reach only when he has been crowned, and mitred too, lord"
2350,VI.,of himself[139]--subject to Him alone of whom even Popes were
2351,VI.,servants.[140]
2352,VI.,
2353,VI.,Although in what were to prove his last months Dante might amuse himself
2354,VI.,"with the composition of learned trifles, and in the society and"
2355,VI.,"correspondence of men who along with him, if on lines apart from his,"
2356,VI.,"were preparing the way for the revival of classical studies, the best"
2357,VI.,"part of his mind, then as for long before, was devoted to the _Comedy_;"
2358,VI.,and he was counting on the suffrages of a wider audience than courts and
2359,VI.,universities could supply.
2360,VI.,
2361,VI.,"Here there is no room to treat at length of that work, to which when we"
2362,VI.,turn our thoughts all else he wrote--though that was enough to secure
2363,VI.,him fame--seems to fall into the background as if unworthy of his
2364,VI.,genius. What can hardly be passed over in silence is that in the
2365,VI.,"_Comedy_, once it was begun, he must have found a refuge for his soul"
2366,VI.,"from all petty cares, and a shield against all adverse fortune. We must"
2367,VI.,"search its pages, and not the meagre records of his biographers, to find"
2368,VI.,"what was the life he lived during the years of his exile; for, in a"
2369,VI.,"sense, it contains the true journal of his thoughts, of his hopes, and"
2370,VI.,of his sorrows. The plan was laid wide enough to embrace the
2371,VI.,"observations he made of nature and of man, the fruits of his painful"
2372,VI.,"studies, and the intelligence he gathered from those experienced in"
2373,VI.,"travel, politics, and war. It was not only his imagination and artistic"
2374,VI.,skill that were spent upon the poem: he gave his life to it. The future
2375,VI.,reward he knew was sure--an immortal fame; but he hoped for a nearer
2376,VI.,"profit on his venture. Florence might at last relent, if not because of"
2377,VI.,"his innocence and at the spectacle of his inconsolable exile, at least"
2378,VI.,on hearing the rumour of his genius borne to her from every corner of
2379,VI.,Italy:--

2381,VI.,"If e'er it comes that this my sacred Lay,"
2382,VI.,To which both Heaven and Earth have set their hand--
2383,VI.,Through which these many years I waste away--

3016,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"him while he was still at a distance, the very party that invited his"
3017,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],presence was soon disgusted with him owing to his faithlessness and
3018,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],greed. The earlier part of his stay was disturbed by pillage and
3019,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"bloodshed. Nor is it easy to imagine how, at any time during his"
3020,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"residence of five months, the leading citizens could have either the"
3021,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],time or the wish to arrange for honouring him in a fashion he was not
3022,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"the man to care for. His one craving was for money, and still more"
3023,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],money; and any leisure the members of public bodies had to spare from

3026,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],they could against their avaricious Pacificator. When he at last
3027,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],delivered the city from his presence no one would have the heart to
3028,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],revive the memory of his disastrous visit.

3030,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"But if, in all this confusion of Florentine affairs, Giotto did receive"
3031,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"a commission to paint in the palace of the Podesta, yet it remains"
3032,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"incredible that he should have been suffered to assign to Dante, of all"
3033,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"men, a place of honour in the picture. No citizen had more stubbornly"
3034,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"opposed the policy which brought Charles of Valois to Florence, and that"
3035,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],Charles was in the city was reason enough for Dante to keep out of it.
3036,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"In his absence, he was sentenced in January 1302 to pay a ruinously"
3037,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"heavy fine, and in the following March he was condemned to be put to"
3038,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],death if ever he was caught. On fuller acquaintance his fellow-citizens
3039,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"liked the Frenchman as little as he, but this had no effect in softening"
3040,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],their dislike or removing their fear of Dante. We may be sure that any
3041,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"friends he may still have had in Florence, as their influence could not"
3042,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"protect his goods from confiscation or him from banishment, would hardly"
3043,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"care to risk their own safety by urging, while his condemnation was"
3044,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"still fresh, the admission of his portrait among those of illustrious"
3045,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],Florentines.[151] It is true that there have been instances of great
3046,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],artists having reached so high a pitch of fame as to be able to dictate
3047,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"terms to patrons, however exalted. In his later years Giotto could"
3048,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"perhaps have made such a point a matter of treaty with his employers,"
3049,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"but in 1301 he was still young,[152] and great although his fame already"
3050,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"was, he could scarcely have ventured to insist on the Republic's"
3051,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],confessing its injustice to his friend; as it would have done had it
3052,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"consented that Dante, newly driven into exile, should obtain a place of"
3053,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],honour in a work painted at the public cost.
3054,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],
3055,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],These considerations seem to make it highly improbable that Giotto's
3056,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],wall-painting was meant to do honour to Charles of Valois and the
3057,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],Cardinal Acquasparta. But if it should still be held that it was painted
3058,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"in 1302, we must either cease to believe, in spite of all that Vasari"
3059,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"and the others say, that the portrait is meant for Dante; or else"
3060,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],confess it to be inexplicable how it got there. A way out of the
3061,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],difficulty begins to open up as soon as we allow ourselves some latitude
3062,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],in speculating as to when Giotto may have painted the fresco. The order
3063,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],in which that artist's works were produced is very imperfectly settled;
3064,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],and it may easily be that the position in Vasari's pages of the mention
3065,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],made by him of this fresco has given rise to a misunderstanding
3066,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],regarding the date of it. He speaks of it at the very beginning of his
3067,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],Life of Giotto. But this he does because he needs an illustration of
3068,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],what he has been saying in his opening sentences about the advance that
3069,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],painter made on Cimabue. Only after making mention of Dante's portrait
3070,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],does he begin his chronological list of Giotto's works; to the portrait
3071,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"he never returns, and so, as far as Vasari is concerned, it is without a"
3072,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],date. Judging of it by means of Mr. Kirkup's careful and beautiful
3073,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],sketch--and unfortunately we have now no other means of knowing what the
3074,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],original was like--it may safely be asserted to be in Giotto's ripest
3075,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"style.[153] Everything considered, it is therefore allowable to search"
3076,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],the Florentine chronicles lower down for an event more likely to be the
3077,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],subject of Giotto's fresco than that usually fixed upon.
3078,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],
3079,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],We read in John Villani that in the middle of the year 1326 the Cardinal
3080,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],Gianni Orsini came to Florence as Papal Legate and Pacificator of
3081,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"Tuscany. The city was greatly pleased at his coming, and as an earnest"
3082,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],of gratitude for his services presented him with a cup containing a
3083,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],thousand florins.[154] A month later there arrived Charles Duke of
3084,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"Calabria, the eldest son of King Robert of Naples, and great-grandson of"
3085,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"Charles of Anjou. He came as Protector of the Commonwealth, which"
3086,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"office--an extraordinary one, and with a great salary attached to it--he"
3087,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],had been elected to hold for five years. Never before had a spectacle
3088,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],like that of his entry been offered to Florence. Villani gives a long
3089,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"list of the barons who rode in his train, and tells that in his"
3090,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],squadrons of men-at-arms there were no fewer than two hundred knights.
3091,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],The chronicler pauses to bid the reader note how great an enterprise his
3092,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"fellow-citizens had shown in bringing to sojourn among them, and in"
3093,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"their interest, not only such a powerful lord as the Duke of Calabria"
3094,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"was, but a Papal Legate as well. Italy counted it a great thing, he"
3095,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"says, and he deems that the whole world ought to know of it.[155]"
3096,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],Charles took up his abode in the Podesta's palace. He appears to have
3097,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],gained a better place in the hearts of the Florentines than what they
3098,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"were used to give to strangers and princes. When a son was born to him,"
3099,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"all the city rejoiced, and it mourned with him when, in a few weeks, he"
3100,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],lost the child. After seventeen months' experience of his rule the
3101,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"citizens were sorry to lose him, and bade him a farewell as hearty as"
3102,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"their welcome had been. To some of them, it is true, the policy seemed a"
3103,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],dangerous one which bore even the appearance of subjecting the Republic
3104,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],to the Royal House of Naples; and some of them could have wished that he
3105,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],'had shown more vigour in civil and military affairs. But he was a
3106,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"gentle lord, popular with the townsfolk, and in the course of his"
3107,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"residence he greatly improved the condition of things in Florence, and"
3108,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],brought to a close many feuds.'[156] They felt that the nine hundred
3109,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"thousand gold florins spent on him and his men had, on the whole, been"
3110,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],well laid out.
3111,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],
3112,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],One detail of the Duke's personal appearance deserves remark. We have
3113,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],seen that the prince in the fresco has long hair. John Villani had known
3114,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"the Duke well by sight, and when he comes to record his death and"
3115,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"describe what kind of man he was to look upon, he specially says that"
3116,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],'he wore his hair loose.'[157]
3117,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],
3118,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"A subject worthy of Giotto's pencil, and one likely to be offered to him"
3119,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"if he was then in Florence, we have therefore found in this visit of the"
3120,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],Duke and the Cardinal. But that Giotto was in Florence at that time is
3121,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],certain. He painted a portrait[158] of the Duke in the Palace of the
3122,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"Signory; and through that prince, as Vasari tells, he was invited by"
3123,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"King Robert to go down to work in Naples. All this, in the absence of"
3124,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"evidence of any value in favour of another date, makes it, at the very"
3125,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"least, highly probable that the fresco was a work of 1326 or 1327."
3126,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],
3127,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],In 1326 Dante had been dead for five years. The grudge his
3128,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],fellow-townsmen had nourished against him for so long was now worn out.
3129,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],We know that very soon after his death Florence began to be proud of
3130,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],him; and even such of his old enemies as still survived would be willing
3131,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],that Giotto should set him in a place of honour among the great
3132,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],Florentines who help to fill the fresco of the Paradise. That he was
3133,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],already dead would be no hindrance to his finding room alongside of
3134,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],Charles of Calabria; for the age was wisely tolerant of such
3135,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],anachronisms.[159] Had Dante been still living the painter would have
3136,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"been less at liberty to create, out of the records he doubtless"
3137,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],possessed of the features of the friend who had paid him beforehand with
3138,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"one immortal line, the face which, as we look into it, we feel to be a"
3139,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],glorified transcript of what it was in the flesh. It is the face of one
3140,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"who has wellnigh forgotten his earthly life, instead of having the worst"
3141,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"of it still before him; of one who, from that troubled Italy which like"
3142,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],"his own Sapia he knew but as a pilgrim, has passed to the 'true city,'"
3143,GIOTTO'S PORTRAIT OF DANTE.[142],of which he remains for evermore a citizen--the city faintly imaged by

4813,FOOTNOTES:,till the middle of August 1300 he was one of the Priors. In the course

5037,FOOTNOTES:,their sins while in life. They were one-sided in their use of wealth; so
5038,FOOTNOTES:,here they can never complete the circle. The monotony of their
5039,FOOTNOTES:,"employment and of their cries represents their subjection to one idea,"
5040,FOOTNOTES:,"and, as in life, so now, their displeasure is excited by nothing so much"
5041,FOOTNOTES:,as by coming into contact with the failing opposite to their own. Yet
5042,FOOTNOTES:,they are set in the same circle because the sin of both arose from
5043,FOOTNOTES:,"inordinate desire of wealth, the miser craving it to hoard, and the"
5044,FOOTNOTES:,spendthrift to spend. In Purgatory also they are placed together (see
5045,FOOTNOTES:,"_Purg._ xxii. 40). So, on Dante's scheme, liberality is allied to and"
5046,FOOTNOTES:,dependent on a wise and reasonable frugality.--There is no hint of the

5120,FOOTNOTES:,"pursuit of good, as, _e.g._ neglect of the means of grace. This is,"
5121,FOOTNOTES:,"theologically speaking, the sin directly opposed to the active grace of"
5122,FOOTNOTES:,charity. By more modern critics it has been ingeniously sought to find
5123,FOOTNOTES:,in this circle a place not only for the slothful but for the proud and
5124,FOOTNOTES:,envious as well. To each of these classes of sinners--such of them as
5125,FOOTNOTES:,"have repented in this life--a terrace of Purgatory is assigned, and at"
5126,FOOTNOTES:,first sight it does seem natural to expect that the impenitent among
5127,FOOTNOTES:,"them should be found in Inferno. But, while in Purgatory souls purge"
5128,FOOTNOTES:,"themselves of every kind of mortal sin, Inferno, as Dante conceived of"
5129,FOOTNOTES:,"it, contains only such sinners as have been guilty of wicked acts. Drift"
5130,FOOTNOTES:,and bent of heart and mind are taken no account of. The evil seed must
5131,FOOTNOTES:,"have borne a harvest, and the guilt of every victim of Justice must be"
5132,FOOTNOTES:,"plain and open. Now, pride and envy are sins indeed, but sins that a man"
5133,FOOTNOTES:,may keep to himself. If they have betrayed the subject of them into the
5134,FOOTNOTES:,"commission of crimes, in those crimes they are punished lower down, as"
5135,FOOTNOTES:,is indicated at xii. 49. And so we find that Lucifer is condemned as a
5136,FOOTNOTES:,"traitor, though his treachery sprang from envy: the greater guilt"
5137,FOOTNOTES:,includes the less. For sluggishness in the pursuit of good the vestibule
5138,FOOTNOTES:,of the caitiffs seems the appropriate place.--There are two kinds of
5139,FOOTNOTES:,"wrath. One is vehement, and declares itself in violent acts; the other"
5140,FOOTNOTES:,"does not blaze out, but is grudging and adverse to all social good--the"
5141,FOOTNOTES:,wrath that is nursed. One as much as the other affects behaviour. So in
5142,FOOTNOTES:,"this circle, as in the preceding, we have represented the two excesses"
5143,FOOTNOTES:,of one sin.--Dante's theory of sins is ably treated of in Witte's

5708,CANTO X.,"Propped on his knees, if I surmised aright."
5709,CANTO X.,He peered around as if he fain would win

5711,CANTO X.,"And then, his hope all spent, did thus begin,"
5712,CANTO X.,Weeping: 'By dint of genius if it be

5754,CANTO X.,"'Like those who see best what is far from them,                  100"

5769,CANTO X.,"Me now my Master called, whence I besought"
5770,CANTO X.,"With more than former sharpness of the shade,"
5771,CANTO X.,To tell me what companions he had got.
5772,CANTO X.,He answered me: 'Some thousand here are laid
5773,CANTO X.,"With me; 'mong these the Second Frederick,[370]"
5774,CANTO X.,The Cardinal[371] too; of others nought be said.'              120

5776,CANTO X.,"I turned my steps, revolving in my brain"
5777,CANTO X.,The ominous words[372] which I had heard him speak.
5778,CANTO X.,"He moved, and as we onward went again"
5779,CANTO X.,Demanded of me: 'Wherefore thus amazed?'
5780,CANTO X.,And to his question I made answer plain.
5781,CANTO X.,"'Within thy mind let there be surely placed,'"
5782,CANTO X.,"The Sage bade, 'what 'gainst thee thou heardest say."

7574,FOOTNOTES:,"commentators, wore when he was a young man, following in this a fashion"
7575,FOOTNOTES:,common enough among pious laymen who had no thought of ever becoming
7576,FOOTNOTES:,"friars. But the simile of the cord, as representing sobriety and"
7577,FOOTNOTES:,"virtuous purpose, is not strange to Dante. In _Purg._ vii. 114 he"
7578,FOOTNOTES:,describes Pedro of Arragon as being girt with the cord of every virtue;
7579,FOOTNOTES:,and Pedro was no Franciscan. Dante's cord may therefore be taken as
7580,FOOTNOTES:,standing for vigilance or self-control. With it he had hoped to get the
7581,FOOTNOTES:,"better of the leopard (_Inf._ i. 32), and may have trusted in it for"

7583,FOOTNOTES:,"with it ever since he entered by the gate, it has not saved him from a"
7584,FOOTNOTES:,"single fear, far less from a single danger; and now it is cast away as"
7585,FOOTNOTES:,"useless. Henceforth, more than ever, he is to confide wholly in Virgil"
7586,FOOTNOTES:,and have no confidence in himself. Nor is he to be girt again till he
7587,FOOTNOTES:,"reaches the coast of Purgatory, and then it is to be with a reed, the"

8710,CANTO XXI.,Nor lingers longer what there is to see;
8711,CANTO XXI.,For a black devil I beheld advance

8713,CANTO XXI.,"Ah me, how fierce was he of countenance!"
8714,CANTO XXI.,"What bitterness he in his gesture put,"
8715,CANTO XXI.,As with spread wings he o'er the ground did dance!
8716,CANTO XXI.,"Upon his shoulders, prominent and acute,"
8717,CANTO XXI.,Was perched a sinner[578] fast by either hip;
8718,CANTO XXI.,And him he held by tendon of the foot.
8719,CANTO XXI.,"He from our bridge: 'Ho, Malebranche![579] Grip"

8721,CANTO XXI.,Stuff him below; myself once more I slip
8722,CANTO XXI.,Back to the place where lack of such is none.                     40
8723,CANTO XXI.,"There, save Bonturo, barrates[581] every man,"
8724,CANTO XXI.,And No grows Yes that money may be won.'
8725,CANTO XXI.,"He shot him down, and o'er the cliff began"
8726,CANTO XXI.,"To run; nor unchained mastiff o'er the ground,"
8727,CANTO XXI.,"Chasing a robber, swifter ever ran."
8728,CANTO XXI.,"The other sank, then rose with back bent round;"
8729,CANTO XXI.,But from beneath the bridge the devils cried:
8730,CANTO XXI.,"'Not here the Sacred Countenance[582] is found,"
8731,CANTO XXI.,One swims not here as on the Serchio's[583] tide;
8732,CANTO XXI.,So if thou wouldst not with our grapplers deal                  50
8733,CANTO XXI.,Do not on surface of the pitch abide.'
8734,CANTO XXI.,Then he a hundred hooks[584] was made to feel.
8735,CANTO XXI.,"'Best dance down there,' they said the while to him,"
8736,CANTO XXI.,"'Where, if thou canst, thou on the sly mayst steal.'"
8737,CANTO XXI.,So scullions by the cooks are set to trim
8738,CANTO XXI.,The caldrons and with forks the pieces steep
8739,CANTO XXI.,"Down in the water, that they may not swim."
8740,CANTO XXI.,And the good Master said to me: 'Now creep
8741,CANTO XXI.,Behind a rocky splinter for a screen;
8742,CANTO XXI.,So from their knowledge thou thyself shalt keep.                60

8744,CANTO XXI.,"I be opposed, for I am well prepared,"
8745,CANTO XXI.,And formerly[585] have in like contest been.'
8746,CANTO XXI.,Then passing from the bridge's crown he fared
8747,CANTO XXI.,"To the sixth bank,[586] and when thereon he stood"
8748,CANTO XXI.,He needed courage doing what he dared.
8749,CANTO XXI.,In the same furious and tempestuous mood
8750,CANTO XXI.,"In which the dogs upon the beggar leap,"
8751,CANTO XXI.,"Who, halting suddenly, seeks alms or food,"

8753,CANTO XXI.,"Vault of the bridge, with grapplers 'gainst him stretched;"
8754,CANTO XXI.,"But he exclaimed: 'Aloof, and harmless keep!"
8755,CANTO XXI.,"Ere I by any of your hooks be touched,"
8756,CANTO XXI.,Come one of you and to my words give ear;
8757,CANTO XXI.,And then advise you if I should be clutched.'
8758,CANTO XXI.,All cried: 'Let Malacoda then go near;'
8759,CANTO XXI.,"On which one moved, the others standing still."
8760,CANTO XXI.,He coming said: 'What will this[587] help him here?'
8761,CANTO XXI.,"'O Malacoda, is it credible"
8762,CANTO XXI.,"That I am come,' my Master then replied,                        80"
8763,CANTO XXI.,"'Secure your opposition to repel,"
8764,CANTO XXI.,"Without Heaven's will, and fate, upon my side?"
8765,CANTO XXI.,"Let me advance, for 'tis by Heaven's behest"
8766,CANTO XXI.,That I on this rough road another guide.'
8767,CANTO XXI.,"Then was his haughty spirit so depressed,"
8768,CANTO XXI.,"He let his hook drop sudden to his feet,"
8769,CANTO XXI.,"And, 'Strike him not!' commanded all the rest"
8770,CANTO XXI.,"My Leader charged me thus: 'Thou, from thy seat"
8771,CANTO XXI.,"Where 'mid the bridge's ribs thou crouchest low,"
8772,CANTO XXI.,Rejoin me now in confidence complete.'                          90

8774,CANTO XXI.,"And then the devils, crowding, came so near,"
8775,CANTO XXI.,I feared they to their paction false might show.
8776,CANTO XXI.,"So at Caprona[588] saw I footmen fear,"
8777,CANTO XXI.,"Spite of their treaty, when a multitude"

8779,CANTO XXI.,With all my body braced I closer stood
8780,CANTO XXI.,"To him, my Leader, and intently eyed"
8781,CANTO XXI.,"The aspect of them, which was far from good."
8782,CANTO XXI.,"Lowering their grapplers, 'mong themselves they cried:"
8783,CANTO XXI.,'Shall I now tickle him upon the thigh?'                       101
8784,CANTO XXI.,"'Yea, see thou clip him deftly,' one replied."
8785,CANTO XXI.,The demon who in parley had drawn nigh
8786,CANTO XXI.,"Unto my Leader, upon this turned round;"
8787,CANTO XXI.,"'Scarmiglione, lay thy weapon by!'"

8790,CANTO XXI.,All the sixth arch lies ruined on the ground.
8791,CANTO XXI.,"But if it please you further to pass on,"

9028,CANTO XXII.,From one[601] I parted who to them lived near;
9029,CANTO XXII.,"And would that I might use him still for shield,"
9030,CANTO XXII.,"Then hook or claw I should no longer fear,'"
9031,CANTO XXII.,Said Libicocco: 'Too much grace we yield.'                        70
9032,CANTO XXII.,"And in the sinner's arm he fixed his hook,"
9033,CANTO XXII.,And from it clean a fleshy fragment peeled.
9034,CANTO XXII.,But seeing Draghignazzo also took
9035,CANTO XXII.,"Aim at his legs, the leader of the Ten"
9036,CANTO XXII.,Turned swiftly round on them with angry look.
9037,CANTO XXII.,On this they were a little quieted; then
9038,CANTO XXII.,Of him who still gazed on his wound my Guide
9039,CANTO XXII.,Without delay demanded thus again:

9042,CANTO XXII.,"'Gomita of Gallura,'[602] he replied,"
9043,CANTO XXII.,"'A vessel full of fraud of every kind,"
9044,CANTO XXII.,"Who, holding in his power his master's foes,"
9045,CANTO XXII.,So used them him they bear in thankful mind;
9046,CANTO XXII.,"For, taking bribes, he let slip all of those,"
9047,CANTO XXII.,"He says; and he in other posts did worse,"
9048,CANTO XXII.,And as a chieftain 'mong barrators rose.
9049,CANTO XXII.,"Don Michael Zanche[603] doth with him converse,"
9050,CANTO XXII.,"From Logodoro, and with endless din"
9051,CANTO XXII.,They gossip[604] of Sardinian characters.                       90
9052,CANTO XXII.,"But look, ah me! how yonder one doth grin."
9053,CANTO XXII.,"More would I say, but that I am afraid"

9055,CANTO XXII.,"To Farfarel the captain turned his head,"
9056,CANTO XXII.,"For, as about to swoop, he rolled his eye,"
9057,CANTO XXII.,"And, 'Cursed hawk, preserve thy distance!' said."
9058,CANTO XXII.,"'If ye would talk with, or would closer spy,'"
9059,CANTO XXII.,"The frighted wretch began once more to say,"
9060,CANTO XXII.,"'Tuscans or Lombards, I will bring them nigh."

9066,CANTO XXII.,Whenever on the surface we appear.'
9067,CANTO XXII.,"On this Cagnazzo up his muzzle threw,"
9068,CANTO XXII.,Shaking his head and saying: 'Hear the cheat
9069,CANTO XXII.,"He has contrived, to throw himself below.'"
9070,CANTO XXII.,Then he who in devices was complete:
9071,CANTO XXII.,"'Far too malicious, in good sooth,' replied,                   110"
9072,CANTO XXII.,'When for my friends I plan a sorer fate.'
9073,CANTO XXII.,"This, Alichin withstood not but denied"
9074,CANTO XXII.,"The others' counsel,[605] saying: 'If thou fling"

9076,CANTO XXII.,But o'er the pitch I'll dart upon the wing.
9077,CANTO XXII.,"Leave we the ridge,[606] and be the bank a shield;"

9080,CANTO XXII.,"All to the other side turned round their eyes,"
9081,CANTO XXII.,He first[607] who slowest was the boon to yield.               120
9082,CANTO XXII.,In choice of time the Navarrese was wise;
9083,CANTO XXII.,"Taking firm stand, himself he forward flung,"
9084,CANTO XXII.,Eluding thus their hostile purposes.

9086,CANTO XXII.,But he the most[608] whose slackness made them fail;
9087,CANTO XXII.,"Therefore he started, 'Caught!' upon his tongue."
9088,CANTO XXII.,"But little it bested, nor could prevail"

9090,CANTO XXII.,While he with upturned breast aloft did sail.
9091,CANTO XXII.,"And as the falcon, when, on its descent,                         130"

9097,CANTO XXII.,"When the barrator vanished, from behind"
9098,CANTO XXII.,He on his comrade with his talons fell
9099,CANTO XXII.,"And clawed him, 'bove the moat with him entwined."
9100,CANTO XXII.,The other was a spar-hawk terrible
9101,CANTO XXII.,To claw in turn; together then the two                         140
9102,CANTO XXII.,Plunged in the boiling pool. The heat full well
9103,CANTO XXII.,How to unlock their fierce embraces knew;
9104,CANTO XXII.,"But yet they had no power[609] to rise again,"
9105,CANTO XXII.,So were their wings all plastered o'er with glue.

11366,CANTO XXX.,The meanwhile made the apology supreme.

11662,CANTO XXXI.,Even so to me who stood attentive by

11715,FOOTNOTES:,so in height is not clear. We cannot be far mistaken if we assume them
11716,FOOTNOTES:,to stand from fifty to sixty feet high. Virgil and Dante must throw
11717,FOOTNOTES:,their heads well back to look up into the giant's face; and Virgil must
11718,FOOTNOTES:,raise his voice as he speaks.--With regard to the height of the cone it

12286,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,"prisoners in Genoa, all with a view to depress the Ghibeline element in"
12287,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,the city that he might establish himself as an absolute tyrant with the
12288,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,greater ease. In order still further to strengthen his position he
12289,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,entered into a family compact with his Guelf grandson Nino (_Purg._
12290,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,"viii. 53), now at the head of the Visconti. But without the support of"
12291,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,the people it was impossible for him to hold his ground against the
12292,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,"Ghibeline nobles, who resented the arrogance of his manners and were"
12293,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,embittered by the loss of their own share in the government; and these
12294,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,contrived that month by month the charges of treachery brought against
12295,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,"him should increase in virulence. He had, by deserting his post, caused"
12296,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,"the defeat at Meloria, it was said; and had bribed the other Tuscan"
12297,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,"cities to favour him, by ceding to them distant Pisan strongholds. His"
12298,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,"fate was sealed when, having quarrelled with his grandson Nino, he"
12299,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,sought alliance with the Archbishop Roger who now led the Ghibeline
12300,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,opposition. With Ugo's connivance an onslaught was planned upon the
12301,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,Guelfs. To preserve an appearance of impartiality he left the city for a
12302,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,neighbouring villa. On returning to enjoy his riddance from a rival he
12303,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,"was invited to a conference, at which he resisted a proposal that he"
12304,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,should admit partners with him in the government. On this the
12305,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,Archbishop's party raised the cry of treachery; the bells rang out for a
12306,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,"street battle, in which he was worsted; and with his sons he had to take"
12307,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,refuge in the Palace of the People. There he stood a short siege against
12308,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,the Ghibeline families and the angry mob; and in the same palace he was
12309,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,"kept prisoner for twenty days. Then, with his sons and grandsons, he was"
12310,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,"carried in chains to the tower of the Gualandi, which stood where seven"
12311,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,ways met in the heart of Pisa. This was in July 1288. The imprisonment
12312,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,"lasted for months, and seems to have been thus prolonged with the view"
12313,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,of extorting a heavy ransom. It was only in the following March that the
12314,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,"Archbishop ordered his victims to be starved to death; for, being a"
12315,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,"churchman, says one account, he would not shed blood. Not even a"
12316,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,confessor was allowed to Ugo and his sons. After the door of the tower
12317,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,"had been kept closed for eight days it was opened, and the corpses,"
12318,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,"still fettered, were huddled into a tomb in the Franciscan church.--The"
12319,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,original authorities are far from being agreed as to the details of
12320,NOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.,Ugo's overthrow and death.--For the matter of this note I am chiefly
