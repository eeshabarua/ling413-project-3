70,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
71,PREFACE.,
72,PREFACE.,Whether a translation of Homer may be best executed in blank verse or
73,PREFACE.,"in rhyme, is a question in the decision of which no man can find"
74,PREFACE.,"difficulty, who has ever duly considered what translation ought to be,"
75,PREFACE.,or who is in any degree practically acquainted with those very
76,PREFACE.,different kinds of versification. I will venture to assert that a just
77,PREFACE.,"translation of any ancient poet in rhyme, is impossible. No human"
78,PREFACE.,ingenuity can be equal to the task of closing every couplet with sounds
79,PREFACE.,"homotonous, expressing at the same time the full sense, and only the"
80,PREFACE.,"full sense of his original. The translator’s ingenuity, indeed, in this"
81,PREFACE.,"case becomes itself a snare, and the readier he is at invention and"
82,PREFACE.,"expedient, the more likely he is to be betrayed into the widest"
83,PREFACE.,departures from the guide whom he professes to follow. Hence it has
84,PREFACE.,"happened, that although the public have long been in possession of an"
85,PREFACE.,English Homer by a poet whose writings have done immortal honor to his
86,PREFACE.,"country, the demand of a new one, and especially in blank verse, has"
87,PREFACE.,been repeatedly and loudly made by some of the best judges and ablest
88,PREFACE.,writers of the present day.
89,PREFACE.,
90,PREFACE.,I have no contest with my predecessor. None is supposable between
91,PREFACE.,performers on different instruments. Mr. Pope has surmounted all
92,PREFACE.,difficulties in his version of Homer that it was possible to surmount
93,PREFACE.,"in rhyme. But he was fettered, and his fetters were his choice."
94,PREFACE.,"Accustomed always to rhyme, he had formed to himself an ear which"
95,PREFACE.,"probably could not be much gratified by verse that wanted it, and"
96,PREFACE.,"determined to encounter even impossibilities, rather than abandon a"
97,PREFACE.,"mode of writing in which he had excelled every body, for the sake of"
98,PREFACE.,"another to which, unexercised in it as he was, he must have felt strong"
99,PREFACE.,objections.
100,PREFACE.,
101,PREFACE.,I number myself among the warmest admirers of Mr. Pope as an original
102,PREFACE.,"writer, and I allow him all the merit he can justly claim as the"
103,PREFACE.,translator of this chief of poets. He has given us the _Tale of Troy
104,PREFACE.,"divine_ in smooth verse, generally in correct and elegant language, and"
105,PREFACE.,"in diction often highly poetical. But his deviations are so many,"
106,PREFACE.,"occasioned chiefly by the cause already mentioned, that, much as he has"
107,PREFACE.,"done, and valuable as his work is on some accounts, it was yet in the"
108,PREFACE.,humble province of a translator that I thought it possible even for me
109,PREFACE.,to fellow him with some advantage.
110,PREFACE.,
111,PREFACE.,"That he has sometimes altogether suppressed the sense of his author,"
112,PREFACE.,"and has not seldom intermingled his own ideas with it, is a remark"
113,PREFACE.,"which, on this occasion, nothing but necessity should have extorted"
114,PREFACE.,"from me. But we differ sometimes so widely in our matter, that unless"
115,PREFACE.,"this remark, invidious as it seems, be premised, I know not how to"
116,PREFACE.,"obviate a suspicion, on the one hand, of careless oversight, or of"
117,PREFACE.,"factitious embellishment on the other. On this head, therefore, the"
118,PREFACE.,"English reader is to be admonished, that the matter found in me,"
119,PREFACE.,"whether he like it or not, is found also in Homer, and that the matter"
120,PREFACE.,"not found in me, how much soever he may admire it, is found only in Mr."
121,PREFACE.,Pope. I have omitted nothing; I have invented nothing.
122,PREFACE.,
123,PREFACE.,There is indisputably a wide difference between the case of an original
124,PREFACE.,writer in rhyme and a translator. In an original work the author is
125,PREFACE.,"free; if the rhyme be of difficult attainment, and he cannot find it in"
126,PREFACE.,"one direction, he is at liberty to seek it in another; the matter that"
127,PREFACE.,"will not accommodate itself to his occasions he may discard, adopting"
128,PREFACE.,such as will. But in a translation no such option is allowable; the
129,PREFACE.,"sense of the author is required, and we do not surrender it willingly"
130,PREFACE.,even to the plea of necessity. Fidelity is indeed of the very essence
131,PREFACE.,"of translation, and the term itself implies it. For which reason, if we"
132,PREFACE.,"suppress the sense of our original, and force into its place our own,"
133,PREFACE.,"we may call our work an _imitation_, if we please, or perhaps a"
134,PREFACE.,"_paraphrase_, but it is no longer the same author only in a different"
135,PREFACE.,"dress, and therefore it is not translation. Should a painter,"
136,PREFACE.,"professing to draw the likeness of a beautiful woman, give her more or"
137,PREFACE.,"fewer features than belong to her, and a general cast of countenance of"
138,PREFACE.,"his own invention, he might be said to have produced a _jeu d’esprit_,"
139,PREFACE.,"a curiosity perhaps in its way, but by no means the lady in question."
140,PREFACE.,
141,PREFACE.,It will however be necessary to speak a little more largely to this
142,PREFACE.,"subject, on which discordant opinions prevail even among good judges."
143,PREFACE.,
144,PREFACE.,"The free and the close translation have, each, their advocates. But"
145,PREFACE.,inconveniences belong to both. The former can hardly be true to the
146,PREFACE.,"original author’s style and manner, and the latter is apt to be"
147,PREFACE.,"servile. The one loses his peculiarities, and the other his spirit."
148,PREFACE.,"Were it possible, therefore, to find an exact medium, a manner so close"
149,PREFACE.,"that it should let slip nothing of the text, nor mingle any thing"
150,PREFACE.,"extraneous with it, and at the same time so free as to have an air of"
151,PREFACE.,"originality, this seems precisely the mode in which an author might be"
152,PREFACE.,"best rendered. I can assure my readers from my own experience, that to"
153,PREFACE.,"discover this very delicate line is difficult, and to proceed by it"
154,PREFACE.,"when found, through the whole length of a poet voluminous as Homer,"
155,PREFACE.,nearly impossible. I can only pretend to have endeavored it.
156,PREFACE.,
157,PREFACE.,"It is an opinion commonly received, but, like many others, indebted for"
158,PREFACE.,"its prevalence to mere want of examination, that a translator should"
159,PREFACE.,"imagine to himself the style which his author would probably have used,"
160,PREFACE.,had the language into which he is rendered been his own. A direction
161,PREFACE.,which wants nothing but practicability to recommend it. For suppose six
162,PREFACE.,"persons, equally qualified for the task, employed to translate the same"
163,PREFACE.,"Ancient into their own language, with this rule to guide them. In the"
164,PREFACE.,"event it would be found, that each had fallen on a manner different"
165,PREFACE.,"from that of all the rest, and by probable inference it would follow"
166,PREFACE.,"that none had fallen on the right. On the whole, therefore, as has been"
167,PREFACE.,"said, the translation which partakes equally of fidelity and"
168,PREFACE.,"liberality, that is close, but not so close as to be servile, free, but"
169,PREFACE.,"not so free as to be licentious, promises fairest; and my ambition will"
170,PREFACE.,"be sufficiently gratified, if such of my readers as are able, and will"
171,PREFACE.,"take the pains to compare me in this respect with Homer, shall judge"
172,PREFACE.,that I have in any measure attained a point so difficult.
173,PREFACE.,
174,PREFACE.,"As to energy and harmony, two grand requisites in a translation of this"
175,PREFACE.,"most energetic and most harmonious of all poets, it is neither my"
176,PREFACE.,"purpose nor my wish, should I be found deficient in either, or in both,"
177,PREFACE.,to shelter myself under an unfilial imputation of blame to my
178,PREFACE.,"mother-tongue. Our language is indeed less musical than the Greek, and"
179,PREFACE.,there is no language with which I am at all acquainted that is not. But
180,PREFACE.,"it is musical enough for the purposes of melodious verse, and if it"
181,PREFACE.,"seem to fail, on whatsoever occasion, in energy, the blame is due, not"
182,PREFACE.,"to itself, but to the unskilful manager of it. For so long as Milton’s"
183,PREFACE.,"works, whether his prose or his verse, shall exist, so long there will"
184,PREFACE.,"be abundant proof that no subject, however important, however sublime,"
185,PREFACE.,can demand greater force of expression than is within the compass of
186,PREFACE.,the English language.
187,PREFACE.,
188,PREFACE.,I have no fear of judges familiar with original Homer. They need not be
189,PREFACE.,"told that a translation of him is an arduous enterprise, and as such,"
190,PREFACE.,"entitled to some favor. From these, therefore, I shall expect, and"
191,PREFACE.,"shall not be disappointed, considerable candor and allowance."
192,PREFACE.,"Especially _they_ will be candid, and I believe that there are many"
193,PREFACE.,"such, who have occasionally tried their own strength in this _bow of"
194,PREFACE.,"Ulysses_. They have not found it supple and pliable, and with me are"
195,PREFACE.,perhaps ready to acknowledge that they could not always even approach
196,PREFACE.,"with it the mark of their ambition. But I would willingly, were it"
197,PREFACE.,"possible, obviate uncandid criticism, because to answer it is lost"
198,PREFACE.,"labor, and to receive it in silence has the appearance of stately"
199,PREFACE.,"reserve, and self-importance."
200,PREFACE.,
201,PREFACE.,"To those, therefore, who shall be inclined to tell me hereafter that my"
202,PREFACE.,"diction is often plain and unelevated, I reply beforehand that I know"
203,PREFACE.,"it,—that it would be absurd were it otherwise, and that Homer himself"
204,PREFACE.,"stands in the same predicament. In fact, it is one of his numberless"
205,PREFACE.,"excellences, and a point in which his judgment never fails him, that he"
206,PREFACE.,"is grand and lofty always in the right place, and knows infallibly how"
207,PREFACE.,to rise and fall with his subject. _Big words on small matters_ may
208,PREFACE.,serve as a pretty exact definition of the burlesque; an instance of
209,PREFACE.,"which they will find in the Battle of the Frogs and Mice, but none in"
210,PREFACE.,the Iliad.
211,PREFACE.,
212,PREFACE.,"By others I expect to be told that my numbers, though here and there"
213,PREFACE.,"tolerably smooth, are not always such, but have, now and then, an ugly"
214,PREFACE.,"hitch in their gait, ungraceful in itself, and inconvenient to the"
215,PREFACE.,"reader. To this charge also I plead guilty, but beg leave in"
216,PREFACE.,"alleviation of judgment to add, that my limping lines are not numerous,"
217,PREFACE.,"compared with those that limp not. The truth is, that not one of them"
218,PREFACE.,"all escaped me, but, such as they are, they were all made such with a"
219,PREFACE.,wilful intention. In poems of great length there is no blemish more to
220,PREFACE.,"be feared than sameness of numbers, and every art is useful by which it"
221,PREFACE.,"may be avoided. A line, rough in itself, has yet its recommendations;"
222,PREFACE.,"it saves the ear the pain of an irksome monotony, and seems even to add"
223,PREFACE.,"greater smoothness to others. Milton, whose ear and taste were"
224,PREFACE.,"exquisite, has exemplified in his Paradise Lost the effect of this"
225,PREFACE.,practice frequently.
226,PREFACE.,
227,PREFACE.,"Having mentioned Milton, I cannot but add an observation on the"
228,PREFACE.,"similitude of his manner to that of Homer. It is such, that no person"
229,PREFACE.,"familiar with both, can read either without being reminded of the"
230,PREFACE.,"other; and it is in those breaks and pauses, to which the numbers of"
231,PREFACE.,the English poet are so much indebted both for their dignity and
232,PREFACE.,"variety, that he chiefly copies the Grecian. But these are graces to"
233,PREFACE.,"which rhyme is not competent; so broken, it loses all its music; of"
234,PREFACE.,which any person may convince himself by reading a page only of any of
235,PREFACE.,"our poets anterior to Denham, Waller, and Dryden. A translator of"
236,PREFACE.,"Homer, therefore, seems directed by Homer himself to the use of blank"
237,PREFACE.,"verse, as to that alone in which he can be rendered with any tolerable"
238,PREFACE.,representation of his manner in this particular. A remark which I am
239,PREFACE.,"naturally led to make by a desire to conciliate, if possible, some,"
240,PREFACE.,"who, rather unreasonably partial to rhyme, demand it on all occasions,"
241,PREFACE.,and seem persuaded that poetry in our language is a vain attempt
242,PREFACE.,"without it. Verse, that claims to be verse in right of its metre only,"
243,PREFACE.,"they judge to be such rather by courtesy than by kind, on an"
244,PREFACE.,"apprehension that it costs the writer little trouble, that he has only"
245,PREFACE.,"to give his lines their prescribed number of syllables, and so far as"
246,PREFACE.,"the mechanical part is concerned, all is well. Were this true, they"
247,PREFACE.,would have reason on their side; for the author is certainly best
248,PREFACE.,"entitled to applause who succeeds against the greatest difficulty, and"
249,PREFACE.,in verse that calls for the most artificial management in its
250,PREFACE.,"construction. But the case is not as they suppose. To rhyme, in our"
251,PREFACE.,"language, demands no great exertion of ingenuity, but is always easy to"
252,PREFACE.,"a person exercised in the practice. Witness the multitudes who rhyme,"
253,PREFACE.,"but have no other poetical pretensions. Let it be considered too, how"
254,PREFACE.,merciful we are apt to be to unclassical and indifferent language for
255,PREFACE.,"the sake of rhyme, and we shall soon see that the labor lies"
256,PREFACE.,principally on the other side. Many ornaments of no easy purchase are
257,PREFACE.,required to atone for the absence of this single recommendation. It is
258,PREFACE.,"not sufficient that the lines of blank verse be smooth in themselves,"
259,PREFACE.,they must also be harmonious in the combination. Whereas the chief
260,PREFACE.,concern of the rhymist is to beware that his couplets and his sense be
261,PREFACE.,"commensurate, lest the regularity of his numbers should be (too"
262,PREFACE.,"frequently at least) interrupted. A trivial difficulty this, compared"
263,PREFACE.,"with those which attend the poet unaccompanied by his bells. He, in"
264,PREFACE.,"order that he may be musical, must exhibit all the variations, as he"
265,PREFACE.,"proceeds, of which ten syllables are susceptible; between the first"
266,PREFACE.,syllable and the last there is no place at which he must not
267,PREFACE.,"occasionally pause, and the place of the pause must be perpetually"
268,PREFACE.,"shifted. To effect this variety, his attention must be given, at one"
269,PREFACE.,"and the same time, to the pauses he has already made in the period"
270,PREFACE.,"before him, as well as to that which he is about to make, and to those"
271,PREFACE.,which shall succeed it. On no lighter terms than these is it possible
272,PREFACE.,"that blank verse can be written which will not, in the course of a long"
273,PREFACE.,"work, fatigue the ear past all endurance. If it be easier, therefore,"
274,PREFACE.,"to throw five balls into the air and to catch them in succession, than"
275,PREFACE.,"to sport in that manner with one only, then may blank verse be more"
276,PREFACE.,easily fabricated than rhyme. And if to these labors we add others
277,PREFACE.,"equally requisite, a style in general more elaborate than rhyme"
278,PREFACE.,"requires, farther removed from the vernacular idiom both in the"
279,PREFACE.,"language itself and in the arrangement of it, we shall not long doubt"
280,PREFACE.,which of these two very different species of verse threatens the
281,PREFACE.,composer with most expense of study and contrivance. I feel it
282,PREFACE.,"unpleasant to appeal to my own experience, but, having no other voucher"
283,PREFACE.,"at hand, am constrained to it. As I affirm, so I have found. I have"
284,PREFACE.,"dealt pretty largely in both kinds, and have frequently written more"
285,PREFACE.,"verses in a day, with tags, than I could ever write without them. To"
286,PREFACE.,what has been here said (which whether it have been said by others or
287,PREFACE.,"not, I cannot tell, having never read any modern book on the subject) I"
288,PREFACE.,"shall only add, that to be poetical without rhyme, is an argument of a"
289,PREFACE.,sound and classical constitution in any language.
290,PREFACE.,
291,PREFACE.,"A word or two on the subject of the following translation, and I have"
292,PREFACE.,done.
293,PREFACE.,
294,PREFACE.,"My chief boast is that I have adhered closely to my original, convinced"
295,PREFACE.,that every departure from him would be punished with the forfeiture of
296,PREFACE.,some grace or beauty for which I could substitute no equivalent. The
297,PREFACE.,epithets that would consent to an English form I have preserved as
298,PREFACE.,"epithets; others that would not, I have melted into the context. There"
299,PREFACE.,"are none, I believe, which I have not translated in one way or other,"
300,PREFACE.,though the reader will not find them repeated so often as most of them
301,PREFACE.,"are in Homer, for a reason that need not be mentioned."
302,PREFACE.,
303,PREFACE.,Few persons of any consideration are introduced either in the Iliad or
304,PREFACE.,"Odyssey by their own name only, but their patronymic is given also. To"
305,PREFACE.,"this ceremonial I have generally attended, because it is a circumstance"
306,PREFACE.,of my author’s manner.
307,PREFACE.,
308,PREFACE.,Homer never allots less than a whole line to the introduction of a
309,PREFACE.,"speaker. No, not even when the speech itself is no longer than the line"
310,PREFACE.,"that leads it. A practice to which, since he never departs from it, he"
311,PREFACE.,must have been determined by some cogent reason. He probably deemed it
312,PREFACE.,"a formality necessary to the majesty of his narration. In this article,"
313,PREFACE.,"therefore, I have scrupulously adhered to my pattern, considering these"
314,PREFACE.,"introductory lines as heralds in a procession; important persons,"
315,PREFACE.,because employed to usher in persons more important than themselves.
316,PREFACE.,
317,PREFACE.,"It has been my point every where to be as little verbose as possible,"
318,PREFACE.,"though; at the same time, my constant determination not to sacrifice my"
319,PREFACE.,author’s full meaning to an affected brevity.
320,PREFACE.,
321,PREFACE.,"In the affair of style, I have endeavored neither to creep nor to"
322,PREFACE.,"bluster, for no author is so likely to betray his translator into both"
323,PREFACE.,"these faults, as Homer, though himself never guilty of either. I have"
324,PREFACE.,"cautiously avoided all terms of new invention, with an abundance of"
325,PREFACE.,"which, persons of more ingenuity than judgment have not enriched our"
326,PREFACE.,"language, but incumbered it. I have also every where used an"
327,PREFACE.,unabbreviated fullness of phrase as most suited to the nature of the
328,PREFACE.,"work, and, above all, have studied perspicuity, not only because verse"
329,PREFACE.,"is good for little that wants it, but because Homer is the most"
330,PREFACE.,perspicuous of all poets.
331,PREFACE.,
332,PREFACE.,"In all difficult places I have consulted the best commentators, and"
333,PREFACE.,"where they have differed, or have given, as is often the case, a"
334,PREFACE.,"variety of solutions, I have ever exercised my best judgment, and"
335,PREFACE.,"selected that which appears, at least to myself, the most probable"
336,PREFACE.,"interpretation. On this ground, and on account of the fidelity which I"
337,PREFACE.,"have already boasted, I may venture, I believe, to recommend my work as"
338,PREFACE.,promising some usefulness to young students of the original.
339,PREFACE.,
340,PREFACE.,"The passages which will be least noticed, and possibly not at all,"
341,PREFACE.,"except by those who shall wish to find me at a fault, are those which"
342,PREFACE.,have cost me abundantly the most labor. It is difficult to kill a sheep
343,PREFACE.,"with dignity in a modern language, to flay and to prepare it for the"
344,PREFACE.,"table, detailing every circumstance of the process. Difficult also,"
345,PREFACE.,"without sinking below the level of poetry, to harness mules to a wagon,"
346,PREFACE.,"particularizing every article of their furniture, straps, rings,"
347,PREFACE.,"staples, and even the tying of the knots that kept all together. Homer,"
348,PREFACE.,"who writes always to the eye, with all his sublimity and grandeur, has"
349,PREFACE.,the minuteness of a Flemish painter.
350,PREFACE.,
351,PREFACE.,But in what degree I have succeeded in my version either of these
352,PREFACE.,"passages, and such as these, or of others more buoyant and"
353,PREFACE.,"above-ground, and especially of the most sublime, is now submitted to"
354,PREFACE.,"the decision of the reader, to whom I am ready enough to confess that I"
355,PREFACE.,"have not at all consulted their approbation, who account nothing grand"
356,PREFACE.,"that is not turgid, or elegant that is not bedizened with metaphor."
357,PREFACE.,
358,PREFACE.,"I purposely decline all declamation on the merits of Homer, because a"
359,PREFACE.,"translator’s praises of his author are liable to a suspicion of dotage,"
360,PREFACE.,and because it were impossible to improve on those which this author
361,PREFACE.,has received already. He has been the wonder of all countries that his
362,PREFACE.,"works have ever reached, even deified by the greatest names of"
363,PREFACE.,"antiquity, and in some places actually worshipped. And to say truth,"
364,PREFACE.,were it possible that mere man could entitle himself by pre-eminence of
365,PREFACE.,"any kind to divine honors, Homer’s astonishing powers seem to have"
366,PREFACE.,given him the best pretensions.
367,PREFACE.,
368,PREFACE.,I cannot conclude without due acknowledgments to the best critic in
369,PREFACE.,"Homer I have ever met with, the learned and ingenious Mr. Fuseli."
370,PREFACE.,Unknown as he was to me when I entered on this arduous undertaking
371,PREFACE.,(indeed to this moment I have never seen him) he yet voluntarily and
372,PREFACE.,generously offered himself as my revisor. To his classical taste and
373,PREFACE.,just discernment I have been indebted for the discovery of many
374,PREFACE.,"blemishes in my own work, and of beauties, which would otherwise have"
375,PREFACE.,"escaped me, in the original. But his necessary avocations would not"
376,PREFACE.,suffer him to accompany me farther than to the latter books of the
377,PREFACE.,"Iliad, a circumstance which I fear my readers, as well as myself, will"
378,PREFACE.,regret with too much reason.[1]
379,PREFACE.,
380,PREFACE.,"I have obligations likewise to many friends, whose names, were it"
381,PREFACE.,"proper to mention them here, would do me great honor. They have"
382,PREFACE.,"encouraged me by their approbation, have assisted me with valuable"

385,PREFACE.,And now I have only to regret that my pleasant work is ended. To the
386,PREFACE.,illustrious Greek I owe the smooth and easy flight of many thousand
387,PREFACE.,"hours. He has been my companion at home and abroad, in the study, in"
388,PREFACE.,"the garden, and in the field; and no measure of success, let my labors"
389,PREFACE.,"succeed as they may, will ever compensate to me the loss of the"
390,PREFACE.,"innocent luxury that I have enjoyed, as a translator of Homer."

406,SECOND EDITION.,SECOND EDITION.
407,SECOND EDITION.,
408,SECOND EDITION.,"Soon after my publication of this work, I began to prepare it for a"
409,SECOND EDITION.,"second edition, by an accurate revisal of the first. It seemed to me,"
410,SECOND EDITION.,"that here and there, perhaps a slight alteration might satisfy the"
411,SECOND EDITION.,"demands of some, whom I was desirous to please; and I comforted myself"
412,SECOND EDITION.,"with the reflection, that if I still failed to conciliate all, I should"
413,SECOND EDITION.,yet have no cause to account myself in a singular degree unfortunate.
414,SECOND EDITION.,"To please an unqualified judge, an author must sacrifice too much; and"
415,SECOND EDITION.,the attempt to please an uncandid one were altogether hopeless. In one
416,SECOND EDITION.,"or other of these classes may be ranged all such objectors, as would"
417,SECOND EDITION.,"deprive blank verse of one of its principal advantages, the variety of"
418,SECOND EDITION.,"its pauses; together with all such as deny the good effect, on the"
419,SECOND EDITION.,"whole, of a line, now and then, less harmonious than its fellows."
420,SECOND EDITION.,
421,SECOND EDITION.,"With respect to the pauses, it has been affirmed with an unaccountable"
422,SECOND EDITION.,"rashness, that Homer himself has given me an example of verse without"
423,SECOND EDITION.,"them. Had this been true, it would by no means have concluded against"
424,SECOND EDITION.,"the use of them in an English version of Homer; because, in one"
425,SECOND EDITION.,"language, and in one species of metre, that may be musical, which in"
426,SECOND EDITION.,another would be found disgusting. But the assertion is totally
427,SECOND EDITION.,"unfounded. The pauses in Homer’s verse are so frequent and various,"
428,SECOND EDITION.,"that to name another poet, if pauses are a fault, more faulty than he,"
429,SECOND EDITION.,"were, perhaps, impossible. It may even be questioned, if a single"
430,SECOND EDITION.,passage of ten lines flowing with uninterrupted smoothness could be
431,SECOND EDITION.,singled out from all the thousands that he has left us. He frequently
432,SECOND EDITION.,"pauses at the first word of the line, when it consists of three or more"
433,SECOND EDITION.,syllables; not seldom when of two; and sometimes even when of one only.
434,SECOND EDITION.,"In this practice he was followed, as was observed in my Preface to the"
435,SECOND EDITION.,"first edition, by the Author of the Paradise Lost. An example"
436,SECOND EDITION.,"inimitable indeed, but which no writer of English heroic verse without"
437,SECOND EDITION.,rhyme can neglect with impunity.
438,SECOND EDITION.,
439,SECOND EDITION.,Similar to this is the objection which proscribes absolutely the
440,SECOND EDITION.,occasional use of a line irregularly constructed. When Horace censured
441,SECOND EDITION.,"Lucilius for his lines _incomposite pede currentes_, he did not mean to"
442,SECOND EDITION.,"say, that he was chargeable with such in some instances, or even in"
443,SECOND EDITION.,"many, for then the censure would have been equally applicable to"
444,SECOND EDITION.,himself; but he designed by that expression to characterize all his
445,SECOND EDITION.,writings. The censure therefore was just; Lucilius wrote at a time when
446,SECOND EDITION.,"the Roman verse had not yet received its polish, and instead of"
447,SECOND EDITION.,"introducing artfully his rugged lines, and to serve a particular"
448,SECOND EDITION.,"purpose, had probably seldom, and never but by accident, composed a"
449,SECOND EDITION.,smooth one. Such has been the versification of the earliest poets in
450,SECOND EDITION.,"every country. Children lisp, at first, and stammer; but, in time,"
451,SECOND EDITION.,"their speech becomes fluent, and, if they are well taught, harmonious."
452,SECOND EDITION.,
453,SECOND EDITION.,Homer himself is not invariably regular in the construction of his
454,SECOND EDITION.,"verse. Had he been so, Eustathius, an excellent critic and warm admirer"
455,SECOND EDITION.,"of Homer, had never affirmed, that some of his lines want a head, some"
456,SECOND EDITION.,"a tail, and others a middle. Some begin with a word that is neither"
457,SECOND EDITION.,"dactyl nor spondee, some conclude with a dactyl, and in the"
458,SECOND EDITION.,intermediate part he sometimes deviates equally from the established
459,SECOND EDITION.,custom. I confess that instances of this sort are rare; but they are
460,SECOND EDITION.,"surely, though few, sufficient to warrant a sparing use of similar"
461,SECOND EDITION.,license in the present day.
462,SECOND EDITION.,
463,SECOND EDITION.,"Unwilling, however, to seem obstinate in both these particulars, I"
464,SECOND EDITION.,"conformed myself in some measure to these objections, though"
465,SECOND EDITION.,unconvinced myself of their propriety. Several of the rudest and most
466,SECOND EDITION.,unshapely lines I composed anew; and several of the pauses least in use
467,SECOND EDITION.,I displaced for the sake of an easier enunciation.—And this was the
468,SECOND EDITION.,state of the work after the revisal given it about seven years since.
469,SECOND EDITION.,
470,SECOND EDITION.,"Between that revisal and the present a considerable time intervened,"
471,SECOND EDITION.,"and the effect of long discontinuance was, that I became more"
472,SECOND EDITION.,"dissatisfied with it myself, than the most difficult to be pleased of"
473,SECOND EDITION.,all my judges. Not for the sake of a few uneven lines or unwonted
474,SECOND EDITION.,"pauses, but for reasons far more substantial. The diction seemed to me"
475,SECOND EDITION.,"in many passages either not sufficiently elevated, or deficient in the"
476,SECOND EDITION.,"grace of ease, and in others I found the sense of the original either"
477,SECOND EDITION.,not adequately expressed or misapprehended. Many elisions still
478,SECOND EDITION.,remained unsoftened; the compound epithets I found not always happily
479,SECOND EDITION.,"combined, and the same sometimes too frequently repeated."
480,SECOND EDITION.,
481,SECOND EDITION.,"There is no end of passages in Homer, which must creep unless they are"
482,SECOND EDITION.,"lifted; yet in such, all embellishment is out of the question. The hero"
483,SECOND EDITION.,"puts on his clothes, or refreshes himself with food and wine, or he"
484,SECOND EDITION.,"yokes his steed, takes a journey, and in the evening preparation is"
485,SECOND EDITION.,made for his repose. To give relief to subjects prosaic as these
486,SECOND EDITION.,without seeming unreasonably tumid is extremely difficult. Mr. Pope
487,SECOND EDITION.,"much abridges some of them, and others he omits; but neither of these"
488,SECOND EDITION.,"liberties was compatible with the nature of my undertaking. These,"
489,SECOND EDITION.,"therefore, and many similar to these, have been new-modeled; somewhat"
490,SECOND EDITION.,"to their advantage I hope, but not even now entirely to my"
491,SECOND EDITION.,"satisfaction. The lines have a more natural movement, the pauses are"
492,SECOND EDITION.,"fewer and less stately, the expression as easy as I could make it"
493,SECOND EDITION.,"without meanness, and these were all the improvements that I could give"
494,SECOND EDITION.,them.
495,SECOND EDITION.,
496,SECOND EDITION.,"The elisions, I believe, are all cured, with only one exception. An"
497,SECOND EDITION.,"alternative proposes itself to a modern versifier, from which there is"
498,SECOND EDITION.,"no escape, which occurs perpetually, and which, choose as he may,"
499,SECOND EDITION.,presents him always with an evil. I mean in the instance of the
500,SECOND EDITION.,"particle (_the_). When this particle precedes a vowel, shall he melt it"
501,SECOND EDITION.,"into the substantive, or leave the _hiatus_ open? Both practices are"
502,SECOND EDITION.,"offensive to a delicate ear. The particle absorbed occasions harshness,"
503,SECOND EDITION.,"and the open vowel a vacuity equally inconvenient. Sometimes,"
504,SECOND EDITION.,"therefore, to leave it open, and sometimes to ingraft it into its"
505,SECOND EDITION.,"adjunct seems most advisable; this course Mr. Pope has taken, whose"
506,SECOND EDITION.,authority recommended it to me; though of the two evils I have most
507,SECOND EDITION.,frequently chosen the elision as the least.
508,SECOND EDITION.,
509,SECOND EDITION.,Compound epithets have obtained so long in the poetical language of our
510,SECOND EDITION.,"country, that I employed them without fear or scruple. To have"
511,SECOND EDITION.,"abstained from them in a blank verse translation of Homer, who abounds"
512,SECOND EDITION.,"with them, and from whom our poets probably first adopted them, would"
513,SECOND EDITION.,have been strange indeed. But though the genius of our language favors
514,SECOND EDITION.,"the formation of such words almost as much as that of the Greek, it"
515,SECOND EDITION.,"happens sometimes, that a Grecian compound either cannot be rendered in"
516,SECOND EDITION.,"English at all, or, at best, but awkwardly. For this reason, and"
517,SECOND EDITION.,"because I found that some readers much disliked them, I have expunged"
518,SECOND EDITION.,"many; retaining, according to my best judgment, the most eligible only,"
519,SECOND EDITION.,and making less frequent the repetitions even of these.
520,SECOND EDITION.,
521,SECOND EDITION.,I know not that I can add any thing material on the subject of this
522,SECOND EDITION.,"last revisal, unless it be proper to give the reason why the Iliad,"
523,SECOND EDITION.,"though greatly altered, has undergone much fewer alterations than the"
524,SECOND EDITION.,Odyssey. The true reason I believe is this. The Iliad demanded my
525,SECOND EDITION.,utmost possible exertions; it seemed to meet me like an ascent almost
526,SECOND EDITION.,"perpendicular, which could not be surmounted at less cost than of all"
527,SECOND EDITION.,the labor that I could bestow on it. The Odyssey on the contrary seemed
528,SECOND EDITION.,"to resemble an open and level country, through which I might travel at"
529,SECOND EDITION.,"my ease. The latter, therefore, betrayed me into some negligence,"
530,SECOND EDITION.,"which, though little conscious of it at the time, on an accurate"
531,SECOND EDITION.,"search, I found had left many disagreeable effects behind it."
532,SECOND EDITION.,
533,SECOND EDITION.,I now leave the work to its fate. Another may labor hereafter in an
534,SECOND EDITION.,"attempt of the same kind with more success; but more industriously, I"
535,SECOND EDITION.,"believe, none ever will."

546,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,
547,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,I have no other pretensions to the honorable name of Editor on this
548,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"occasion, than as a faithful transcriber of the Manuscript, and a"
549,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"diligent corrector of the Press, which are, doubtless, two of the very"
550,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,humblest employments in that most extensive province. I have wanted the
551,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"ability to attempt any thing higher; and, fortunately for the reader, I"
552,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"have also wanted the presumption. What, however, I can do, I will."
553,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"Instead of critical remark, I will furnish him with anecdote. He shall"
554,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,trace from beginning to end the progress of the following work; and in
555,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"proportion as I have the happiness to engage his attention, I shall"
556,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,merit the name of a fortunate editor.
557,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,
558,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,It was in the darkest season of a most calamitous depression of his
559,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"spirits, that I was summoned to the house of my inestimable friend the"
560,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"Translator, in the month of January, 1794. He had happily completed a"
561,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"revisal of his Homer, and was thinking of the preface to his new"
562,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"edition, when all his satisfaction in the one, and whatever he had"
563,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"projected for the other, in a moment vanished from his mind. He had"
564,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,fallen into a deplorable illness; and though the foremost wish of my
565,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"heart was to lessen the intenseness of his misery, I was utterly unable"
566,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,to afford him any aid.
567,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,
568,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"I had, however, a pleasing though a melancholy opportunity of tracing"
569,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"his recent footsteps in the Field of Troy, and in the Palace of Ithaca."
570,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"He had materially altered both the Iliad and Odyssey; and, so far as my"
571,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"ability allowed me to judge, they were each of them greatly improved."
572,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"He had also, at the request of his bookseller, interspersed the two"
573,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,poems with copious notes; for the most part translations of the ancient
574,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"Scholia, and gleaned, at the cost of many valuable hours, from the"
575,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"pages of Barnes, Clarke, and Villoisson. It has been a constant subject"
576,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"of regret to the admirers of “The Task,” that the exercise of such"
577,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"marvelous original powers, should have been so long suspended by the"
578,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"drudgery of translation; and in this view, their quarrel with the"
579,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"illustrious Greek will be, doubtless, extended to his commentators.[1]"
580,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,
581,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"During two long years from this most anxious period, the translation"
582,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"continued as it was; and though, in the hope of its being able to"
583,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"divert his melancholy, I had attempted more than once to introduce it"
584,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"to its Author, I was every time painfully obliged to desist. But in the"
585,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"summer of ninety-six, when he had resided with me in Norfolk twelve"
586,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"miserable months, the introduction long wished for took place. To my"
587,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"inexpressible astonishment and joy, I surprised him, one morning, with"
588,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"the Iliad in his hand; and with an excess of delight, which I am still"
589,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"more unable to describe, I the next day discovered that he had been"
590,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"writing.—Were I to mention one of the happiest moments of my life, it"
591,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,might be that which introduced me to the following lines:—
592,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,
593,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"Mistaken meanings corrected,"
594,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,admonente G. Wakefield. B. XXIII. L. 429.	that the nave

597,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"Up springs a fish in air, then falls again"
598,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"And disappears beneath the sable flood,"
599,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"So at the stroke, he bounded. L. 1018.	Thenceforth Tydides o’er his"
600,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,ample shield

602,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"Tydides, in return, with spear high-poised"
603,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"O’er the broad shield, aim’d ever at his neck, Or best of all— Then"
604,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"Tydeus’ son, with spear high-poised above"
605,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"The ample shield, stood aiming at his neck."
606,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,
607,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"He had written these lines with a pencil, on a leaf at the end of his"
608,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"Iliad; and when I reflected on the cause which had given them birth, I"
609,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,could not but admire its disproportion to the effect. What the voice of
610,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"persuasion had failed in for a year, accident had silently accomplished"
611,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,in a single day. The circumstance I allude to was this: I received a
612,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"copy of the Iliad and Odyssey of Pope, then recently published by the"
613,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"Editor above mentioned, with illustrative and critical notes of his"
614,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"own. As it commended Mr. Cowper’s Translation in the Preface, and"
615,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"occasionally pointed out its merits in the Notes, I was careful to"
616,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,place it in his way; though it was more from a habit of experiment
617,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"which I had contracted, than from well-grounded hopes of success. But"
618,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,what a fortunate circumstance was the arrival of this Work! and by what
619,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,name worthy of its influence shall I call it? In the mouth of an
620,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,indifferent person it might be Chance; but in mine; whom it rendered so
621,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"peculiarly happy, common gratitude requires that it should be"
622,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,Providence.
623,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,
624,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"As I watched him with an indescribable interest in his progress, I had"
625,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"the satisfaction to find, that, after a few mornings given to"
626,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"promiscuous correction, and to frequent perusal of the above-mentioned"
627,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"Notes, he was evidently settling on the sixteenth Book. This he went"
628,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"regularly through, and the fruits of an application so happily resumed"
629,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"were, one day with another, about sixty new lines. But with the end of"
630,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,the sixteenth Book he had closed the corrections of the year. An
631,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"excursion to the coast, which immediately followed, though it promised"
632,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"an accession of strength to the body, could not fail to interfere with"
633,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,the pursuits of the mind. It was therefore with much less surprise than
634,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"regret, that I saw him relinquish the “_Tale of Troy Divine_.”"
635,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,
636,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"Such was the prelude to the last revisal, which, in the month of"
637,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"January, ninety-seven, Mr. Cowper was persuaded to undertake; and to a"
638,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"faithful copy, as I trust, of which, I have at this time the honor to"
639,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"conduct the reader. But it may not be amiss to observe, that with"
640,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"regard to the earlier books of the Iliad, it was less a revisal of the"
641,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"altered text, than of the text as it stands in the first edition. For"
642,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"though the interleaved copy was always at hand, and in the multitude of"
643,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,its altered places could hardly fail to offer some things worthy to be
644,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"preserved, but which the ravages of illness and the lapse of time might"
645,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"have utterly effaced from his mind, I could not often persuade the"
646,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"Translator to consult it. I was therefore induced, in the course of"
647,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"transcribing, to compare the two revisals as I went along, and to plead"
648,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"for the continuance of the first correction, when it forcibly struck me"
649,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"as better than the last. This, however, but seldom occurred; and the"
650,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"practice, at length, was completely left off, by his consenting to"
651,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,receive into the number of the books which were daily laid open before
652,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"him, the interleaved copy to which I allude."
653,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,
654,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"At the end of the first six books of the Iliad, the arrival of spring"
655,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"brought the usual interruptions of exercise and air, which increased as"
656,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,the summer advanced to a degree so unfavorable to the progress of
657,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"Homer, that in the requisite attention to their salutary claims, the"
658,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"revisal was, at one time, altogether at a stand. Only four books were"
659,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,added in the course of nine months; but opportunity returning as the
660,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"winter set in, there were added, in less than seven weeks, four more:"
661,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,and thus ended the year ninety-seven.
662,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,
663,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"As the spring that succeeded was a happier spring, so it led to a"
664,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"happier summer. We had no longer air and exercise alone, but exercise"
665,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,and Homer hand in hand. He even followed us thrice to the sea: and
666,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,whether our walks were
667,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,
668,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"“on the margin of the land,"
669,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"O’er the green summit of the” cliffs, “whose base"
670,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"Beats back the roaring surge,”"
671,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,“or on the shore
672,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"Of the untillable and barren deep,”"
673,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,
674,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,they were always within hearing of his magic song. About the middle of
675,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"this busy summer, the revisal of the Iliad was brought to a close; and"
676,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"on the very next day, the 24th of July, the correction of the Odyssey"
677,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"commenced,—a morning rendered memorable by a kind and unexpected visit"
678,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"from the patroness of that work, the Dowager Lady Spencer!"
679,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,
680,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,It is not my intention to detain the reader with a progressive account
681,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"of the Odyssey revised, as circumstantial as that of the Iliad, because"
682,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"it went on smoothly from beginning to end, and was finished in less"
683,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,than eight months.
684,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,
685,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,I cannot deliver these volumes to the public without feeling emotions
686,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"of gratitude toward Heaven, in recollecting how often this corrected"
687,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"Work has appeared to me an instrument of Divine mercy, to mitigate the"
688,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,sufferings of my excellent relation. Its progress in our private hours
689,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,was singularly medicinal to his mind: may its presentment to the Public
690,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"prove not less conducive to the honor of the departed Author, who has"
691,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,every claim to my veneration! As a copious life of the Poet is already
692,CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.,"in the press, from the pen of his intimate friend Mr. Hayley, it is"

726,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,
727,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,It is incumbent upon the present Editor to state the reasons which have
728,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,"induced him, between two editions of Cowper’s Homer, differing so"
729,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,materially from each other that they might almost be deemed different
730,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,"versions, to prefer the first."
731,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,
732,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,"Whoever has perused the Translator’s letters, must have perceived that"
733,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,he had considered with no ordinary care the scheme of his
734,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,"versification, and that when he resolved upon altering it in a second"
735,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,"edition, it was in deference to the opinion of others."
736,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,
737,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,It seems to the Editor that Cowper’s own judgment is entitled to more
738,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,"respect, than that of any, or all his critics; and that the version"
739,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,which he composed when his faculties were most active and his spirits
740,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,"least subject to depression,—indeed in the happiest part of his"
741,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,"life,—ought not to be superseded by a revisal, or rather"
742,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,"reconstruction, which was undertaken three years before his death,—not"
743,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,"like the first translation as “a pleasant work, an innocent luxury,”"
744,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,the cheerful and delightful occupation of hope and ardor and
745,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,"ambition,—but as a “hopeless employment,” a task to which he gave “all"
746,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,"his miserable days, and often many hours of the night,” seeking to"
747,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,"beguile the sense of utter wretchedness, by altering as if for the sake"
748,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,of alteration.
749,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,
750,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,The Editor has been confirmed in this opinion by the concurrence of
751,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,every person with whom he has communicated on the subject. Among others
752,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,"he takes the liberty of mentioning Mr. Cary, whose authority upon such"
753,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,"a question is of especial weight, the Translator of Dante being the"
754,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,only one of our countrymen who has ever executed a translation of equal
755,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,"magnitude and not less difficulty, with the same perfect fidelity and"
756,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,admirable skill.
757,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,
758,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,"In support of this determination, the case of Tasso may be cited as"
759,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,curiously in point. The great Italian poet altered his Jerusalem like
760,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,"Cowper, against his own judgment, in submission to his critics: he made"
761,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,"the alteration in the latter years of his life, and in a diseased state"
762,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,of mind; and he proceeded upon the same prescribed rule of smoothing
763,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,"down his versification, and removing all the elisions. The consequence"
764,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,"has been that the reconstructed poem is utterly neglected, and has"
765,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,"rarely, if ever, been reprinted, except in the two great editions of"
766,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,his collected works; while the original poem has been and continues to
767,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,"be in such demand, that the most diligent bibliographer might vainly"
768,ADVERTISEMENT TO SOUTHEY’S EDITION,attempt to enumerate all the editions through which it has passed.

776,EDITOR’S NOTE.,It will be seen by the Advertisement to Southey’s edition of Cowper’s
777,EDITOR’S NOTE.,"Translation of the Iliad, that he has the highest opinion of its"
778,EDITOR’S NOTE.,"merits, and that he also gives the preference to Cowper’s unrevised"
779,EDITOR’S NOTE.,edition. The Editor of the present edition is happy to offer it to the
780,EDITOR’S NOTE.,public under the sanction of such high authority.

1071,BOOK I.,"And furious onset—these I largely reap,205"
1072,BOOK I.,"But, distribution made, thy lot exceeds"
1073,BOOK I.,"Mine far; while I, with any pittance pleased,"
1074,BOOK I.,Bear to my ships the little that I win
1075,BOOK I.,"After long battle, and account it much."
1076,BOOK I.,"But I am gone, I and my sable barks210"

1079,BOOK I.,"Without me, more than thou shalt soon consume.[16]"
1080,BOOK I.,"He ceased, and Agamemnon thus replied"
1081,BOOK I.,"Fly, and fly now; if in thy soul thou feel215"
1082,BOOK I.,Such ardor of desire to go—begone!
1083,BOOK I.,I woo thee not to stay; stay not an hour

1087,BOOK I.,"King or commander whom I hate as thee,"

1089,BOOK I.,And at all times; yet valor is no ground

1092,BOOK I.,"There rule thy Myrmidons.[17] I need not thee,"
1093,BOOK I.,"Nor heed thy wrath a jot. But this I say,"
1094,BOOK I.,Sure as Apollo takes my lovely prize
1095,BOOK I.,"Chrysëis, and I shall return her home"
1096,BOOK I.,"In mine own bark, and with my proper crew,230"
1097,BOOK I.,So sure the fair Brisëis shall be mine.
1098,BOOK I.,I shall demand her even at thy tent.
1099,BOOK I.,"So shalt thou well be taught, how high in power"
1100,BOOK I.,"I soar above thy pitch, and none shall dare"
1101,BOOK I.,"Attempt, thenceforth, comparison with me.235"
1102,BOOK I.,"He ended, and the big, disdainful heart"
1103,BOOK I.,Throbbed of Achilles; racking doubt ensued
1104,BOOK I.,"And sore perplex’d him, whether forcing wide"
1105,BOOK I.,"A passage through them, with his blade unsheathed"
1106,BOOK I.,"To lay Atrides breathless at his foot,240"
1107,BOOK I.,Or to command his stormy spirit down.
1108,BOOK I.,"So doubted he, and undecided yet"
1109,BOOK I.,Stood drawing forth his falchion huge; when lo!
1110,BOOK I.,"Down sent by Juno, to whom both alike"
1111,BOOK I.,"Were dear, and who alike watched over both,245"
1112,BOOK I.,Pallas descended. At his back she stood
1113,BOOK I.,"To none apparent, save himself alone,"
1114,BOOK I.,"And seized his golden locks. Startled, he turned,"
1115,BOOK I.,And instant knew Minerva. Flashed her eyes
1116,BOOK I.,Terrific;[18] whom with accents on the wing250
1117,BOOK I.,"Of haste, incontinent he questioned thus."
1118,BOOK I.,"Daughter of Jove, why comest thou? that thyself"
1119,BOOK I.,May’st witness these affronts which I endure
1120,BOOK I.,"From Agamemnon? Surely as I speak,"
1121,BOOK I.,"This moment, for his arrogance, he dies.255"
1122,BOOK I.,To whom the blue-eyed Deity. From heaven
1123,BOOK I.,"Mine errand is, to sooth, if thou wilt hear,"
1124,BOOK I.,Thine anger. Juno the white-arm’d alike
1125,BOOK I.,"To him and thee propitious, bade me down:"
1126,BOOK I.,Restrain thy wrath. Draw not thy falchion forth.260
1127,BOOK I.,"Retort, and sharply, and let that suffice."
1128,BOOK I.,"For I foretell thee true. Thou shalt receive,"
1129,BOOK I.,"Some future day, thrice told, thy present loss"
1130,BOOK I.,"For this day’s wrong. Cease, therefore, and be still."
1131,BOOK I.,"To whom Achilles. Goddess, although much265"

1133,BOOK I.,"Thy word, which to obey is always best.[19]"
1134,BOOK I.,"Who hears the Gods, the Gods hear also him."
1135,BOOK I.,He said; and on his silver hilt the force
1136,BOOK I.,"Of his broad hand impressing, sent the blade270"
1137,BOOK I.,"Home to its rest, nor would the counsel scorn"
1138,BOOK I.,"Of Pallas. She to heaven well-pleased return’d,"
1139,BOOK I.,And in the mansion of Jove Ægis[20]-armed
1140,BOOK I.,"Arriving, mingled with her kindred Gods."
1141,BOOK I.,"But though from violence, yet not from words275"
1142,BOOK I.,"Abstained Achilles, but with bitter taunt"
1143,BOOK I.,"Opprobrious, his antagonist reproached."
1144,BOOK I.,"Oh charged with wine, in steadfastness of face"
1145,BOOK I.,"Dog unabashed, and yet at heart a deer!"
1146,BOOK I.,"Thou never, when the troops have taken arms,280"
1147,BOOK I.,Hast dared to take thine also; never thou
1148,BOOK I.,"Associate with Achaia’s Chiefs, to form"
1149,BOOK I.,The secret ambush.[21] No. The sound of war
1150,BOOK I.,Is as the voice of destiny to thee.
1151,BOOK I.,"Doubtless the course is safer far, to range285"
1152,BOOK I.,"Our numerous host, and if a man have dared"

1154,BOOK I.,King! over whom? Women and spiritless—
1155,BOOK I.,Whom therefore thou devourest; else themselves
1156,BOOK I.,Would stop that mouth that it should scoff no more.290
1157,BOOK I.,But hearken. I shall swear a solemn oath.
1158,BOOK I.,"By this same sceptre,[22] which shall never bud,"
1159,BOOK I.,"Nor boughs bring forth as once, which having left"
1160,BOOK I.,"Its stock on the high mountains, at what time"
1161,BOOK I.,"The woodman’s axe lopped off its foliage green,295"
1162,BOOK I.,"And stript its bark, shall never grow again;"
1163,BOOK I.,"Which now the judges of Achaia bear,"
1164,BOOK I.,"Who under Jove, stand guardians of the laws,"
1165,BOOK I.,By this I swear (mark thou the sacred oath)
1166,BOOK I.,"Time shall be, when Achilles shall be missed;300"
1167,BOOK I.,"When all shall want him, and thyself the power"
1168,BOOK I.,"To help the Achaians, whatsoe’er thy will;"
1169,BOOK I.,When Hector at your heels shall mow you down:
1170,BOOK I.,"The Hero-slaughtering Hector! Then thy soul,"
1171,BOOK I.,"Vexation-stung, shall tear thee with remorse,305"
1172,BOOK I.,"That thou hast scorn’d, as he were nothing worth,"
1173,BOOK I.,"A Chief, the soul and bulwark of your cause."
1174,BOOK I.,"So saying, he cast his sceptre on the ground"
1175,BOOK I.,"Studded with gold, and sat. On the other side"
1176,BOOK I.,"The son of Atreus all impassion’d stood,310"
1177,BOOK I.,When the harmonious orator arose
1178,BOOK I.,"Nestor, the Pylian oracle, whose lips"
1179,BOOK I.,Dropped eloquence—the honey not so sweet.
1180,BOOK I.,Two generations past of mortals born
1181,BOOK I.,"In Pylus, coëtaneous with himself,315"
1182,BOOK I.,He govern’d now the third—amid them all
1183,BOOK I.,"He stood, and thus, benevolent, began."
1184,BOOK I.,Ah! what calamity hath fall’n on Greece!
1185,BOOK I.,"Now Priam and his sons may well exult,"
1186,BOOK I.,Now all in Ilium shall have joy of heart320
1187,BOOK I.,"Abundant, hearing of this broil, the prime"
1188,BOOK I.,"Of Greece between, in council and in arms."
1189,BOOK I.,But be persuaded; ye are younger both
1190,BOOK I.,"Than I, and I was conversant of old"
1191,BOOK I.,"With Princes your superiors, yet from them325"
1192,BOOK I.,No disrespect at any time received.
1193,BOOK I.,Their equals saw I never; never shall;
1194,BOOK I.,"Exadius, Cœneus, and the Godlike son"
1195,BOOK I.,"Of Ægeus, mighty Theseus; men renown’d"
1196,BOOK I.,"For force superior to the race of man,330"
1197,BOOK I.,"Brave Chiefs they were, and with brave foes they fought,"
1198,BOOK I.,With the rude dwellers on the mountain-heights
1199,BOOK I.,"The Centaurs,[23] whom with havoc such as fame"
1200,BOOK I.,"Shall never cease to celebrate, they slew."
1201,BOOK I.,"With these men I consorted erst, what time335"
1202,BOOK I.,"From Pylus, though a land from theirs remote,"
1203,BOOK I.,"They called me forth, and such as was my strength,"
1204,BOOK I.,With all that strength I served them. Who is he?
1205,BOOK I.,What Prince or Chief of the degenerate race
1206,BOOK I.,Now seen on earth who might with these compare?340
1207,BOOK I.,Yet even these would listen and conform
1208,BOOK I.,"To my advice in consultation given,"
1209,BOOK I.,Which hear ye also; for compliance proves
1210,BOOK I.,Oft times the safer and the manlier course.
1211,BOOK I.,"Thou, Agamemnon! valiant as thou art,345"
1212,BOOK I.,"Seize not the maid, his portion from the Greeks,"
1213,BOOK I.,"But leave her his; nor thou, Achilles, strive"
1214,BOOK I.,With our imperial Chief; for never King
1215,BOOK I.,Had equal honor at the hands of Jove
1216,BOOK I.,"With Agamemnon, or was throned so high.350"
1217,BOOK I.,"Say thou art stronger, and art Goddess-born,"
1218,BOOK I.,"How then? His territory passes thine,"
1219,BOOK I.,And he is Lord of thousands more than thou.
1220,BOOK I.,"Cease, therefore, Agamemnon; calm thy wrath;"
1221,BOOK I.,And it shall be mine office to entreat355
1222,BOOK I.,"Achilles also to a calm, whose might"
1223,BOOK I.,The chief munition is of all our host.
1224,BOOK I.,"To whom the sovereign of the Greeks replied,"
1225,BOOK I.,"The son of Atreus. Thou hast spoken well,"
1226,BOOK I.,"Old Chief, and wisely. But this wrangler here—360"
1227,BOOK I.,Nought will suffice him but the highest place:
1228,BOOK I.,"He must control us all, reign over all,"
1229,BOOK I.,Dictate to all; but he shall find at least
1230,BOOK I.,"One here, disposed to question his commands."
1231,BOOK I.,"If the eternal Gods have made him brave,365"
1232,BOOK I.,Derives he thence a privilege to rail?
1233,BOOK I.,Whom thus Achilles interrupted fierce.
1234,BOOK I.,Could I be found so abject as to take
1235,BOOK I.,"The measure of my doings at thy lips,"
1236,BOOK I.,"Well might they call me coward through the camp,370"
1237,BOOK I.,"A vassal, and a fellow of no worth."
1238,BOOK I.,Give law to others. Think not to control
1239,BOOK I.,"Me, subject to thy proud commands no more."
1240,BOOK I.,Hear yet again! And weigh what thou shalt hear.
1241,BOOK I.,"I will not strive with thee in such a cause,375"
1242,BOOK I.,Nor yet with any man; I scorn to fight
1243,BOOK I.,"For her, whom having given, ye take away."
1244,BOOK I.,But I have other precious things on board;
1245,BOOK I.,Of those take none away without my leave.
1246,BOOK I.,"Or if it please thee, put me to the proof380"
1247,BOOK I.,"Before this whole assembly, and my spear"
1248,BOOK I.,"Shall stream that moment, purpled with thy blood."
1249,BOOK I.,Thus they long time in opposition fierce
1250,BOOK I.,"Maintained the war of words; and now, at length,"
1251,BOOK I.,"(The grand consult dissolved,) Achilles walked385"
1252,BOOK I.,(Patroclus and the Myrmidons his steps
1253,BOOK I.,Attending) to his camp and to his fleet.
1254,BOOK I.,"But Agamemnon order’d forth a bark,"
1255,BOOK I.,"A swift one, manned with twice ten lusty rowers;"
1256,BOOK I.,He sent on board the Hecatomb:[24] he placed390
1257,BOOK I.,"Chrysëis with the blooming cheeks, himself,"
1258,BOOK I.,And to Ulysses gave the freight in charge.
1259,BOOK I.,"So all embarked, and plow’d their watery way."
1260,BOOK I.,"Atrides, next, bade purify the host;"
1261,BOOK I.,"The host was purified, as he enjoin’d,395"
1262,BOOK I.,And the ablution cast into the sea.
1263,BOOK I.,"Then to Apollo, on the shore they slew,"
1264,BOOK I.,"Of the untillable and barren deep,"
1265,BOOK I.,"Whole Hecatombs of bulls and goats, whose steam"
1266,BOOK I.,Slowly in smoky volumes climbed the skies.400
1267,BOOK I.,Thus was the camp employed; nor ceased the while
1268,BOOK I.,The son of Atreus from his threats denounced
1269,BOOK I.,"At first against Achilles, but command"
1270,BOOK I.,Gave to Talthybius and Eurybates
1271,BOOK I.,"His heralds, ever faithful to his will.405"
1272,BOOK I.,Haste—Seek ye both the tent of Peleus’ son
1273,BOOK I.,Achilles. Thence lead hither by the hand
1274,BOOK I.,"Blooming Brisëis, whom if he withhold,"
1275,BOOK I.,"Not her alone, but other spoil myself"
1276,BOOK I.,Will take in person—He shall rue the hour.410
1277,BOOK I.,With such harsh message charged he them dismissed
1278,BOOK I.,"They, sad and slow, beside the barren waste"
1279,BOOK I.,"Of Ocean, to the galleys and the tents"
1280,BOOK I.,Moved of the Myrmidons. Him there they found
1281,BOOK I.,"Beneath the shadow of his bark reclined,415"
1282,BOOK I.,"Nor glad at their approach. Trembling they stood,"
1283,BOOK I.,"In presence of the royal Chief, awe-struck,"
1284,BOOK I.,Nor questioned him or spake. He not the less
1285,BOOK I.,"Knew well their embassy, and thus began."
1286,BOOK I.,"Ye heralds, messengers of Gods and men,420"
1287,BOOK I.,"Hail, and draw near! I bid you welcome both."
1288,BOOK I.,I blame not you; the fault is his alone
1289,BOOK I.,Who sends you to conduct the damsel hence
1290,BOOK I.,"Brisëis. Go, Patroclus, generous friend!"
1291,BOOK I.,"Lead forth, and to their guidance give the maid.425"
1292,BOOK I.,But be themselves my witnesses before
1293,BOOK I.,"The blessed Gods, before mankind, before"
1294,BOOK I.,"The ruthless king, should want of me be felt"
1295,BOOK I.,"To save the host from havoc[25]—Oh, his thoughts"
1296,BOOK I.,"Are madness all; intelligence or skill,430"
1297,BOOK I.,"Forecast or retrospect, how best the camp"
1298,BOOK I.,"May be secured from inroad, none hath he."
1299,BOOK I.,"He ended, nor Patroclus disobey’d,"
1300,BOOK I.,But leading beautiful Brisëis forth
1301,BOOK I.,Into their guidance gave her; loth she went435
1302,BOOK I.,"From whom she loved, and looking oft behind."
1303,BOOK I.,"Then wept Achilles, and apart from all,"
1304,BOOK I.,With eyes directed to the gloomy Deep
1305,BOOK I.,"And arms outstretch’d, his mother suppliant sought."
1306,BOOK I.,"Since, mother, though ordain’d so soon to die,440"
1307,BOOK I.,"I am thy son, I might with cause expect"
1308,BOOK I.,"Some honor at the Thunderer’s hands, but none"
1309,BOOK I.,"To me he shows, whom Agamemnon, Chief"
1310,BOOK I.,"Of the Achaians, hath himself disgraced,"
1311,BOOK I.,Seizing by violence my just reward.445
1312,BOOK I.,"So prayed he weeping, whom his mother heard"
1313,BOOK I.,Within the gulfs of Ocean where she sat
1314,BOOK I.,Beside her ancient sire. From the gray flood
1315,BOOK I.,"Ascending sudden, like a mist she came,"
1316,BOOK I.,"Sat down before him, stroked his face, and said.450"
1317,BOOK I.,Why weeps my son? and what is thy distress?
1318,BOOK I.,Hide not a sorrow that I wish to share.
1319,BOOK I.,"To whom Achilles, sighing deep, replied."
1320,BOOK I.,Why tell thee woes to thee already known?
1321,BOOK I.,"At Thebes, Eëtion’s city we arrived,455"
1322,BOOK I.,"Smote, sack’d it, and brought all the spoil away."
1323,BOOK I.,"Just distribution made among the Greeks,"
1324,BOOK I.,The son of Atreus for his lot received
1325,BOOK I.,"Blooming Chrysëis. Her, Apollo’s priest"
1326,BOOK I.,"Old Chryses followed to Achaia’s camp,460"
1327,BOOK I.,That he might loose his daughter. Ransom rich
1328,BOOK I.,"He brought, and in his hands the hallow’d wreath"
1329,BOOK I.,And golden sceptre of the Archer God
1330,BOOK I.,"Apollo, bore; to the whole Grecian host,"
1331,BOOK I.,But chiefly to the foremost in command465
1332,BOOK I.,"He sued, the sons of Atreus; then, the rest"
1333,BOOK I.,"All recommended reverence of the Seer,"
1334,BOOK I.,And prompt acceptance of his costly gifts.
1335,BOOK I.,"But Agamemnon might not so be pleased,"
1336,BOOK I.,Who gave him rude dismission; he in wrath470
1337,BOOK I.,"Returning, prayed, whose prayer Apollo heard,"
1338,BOOK I.,For much he loved him. A pestiferous shaft
1339,BOOK I.,"He instant shot into the Grecian host,"
1340,BOOK I.,And heap’d the people died. His arrows swept
1341,BOOK I.,"The whole wide camp of Greece, till at the last475"
1342,BOOK I.,"A Seer, by Phœbus taught, explain’d the cause."
1343,BOOK I.,I first advised propitiation. Rage
1344,BOOK I.,"Fired Agamemnon. Rising, he denounced"
1345,BOOK I.,"Vengeance, and hath fulfilled it. She, in truth,"
1346,BOOK I.,"Is gone to Chrysa, and with her we send480"
1347,BOOK I.,Propitiation also to the King
1348,BOOK I.,Shaft-arm’d Apollo. But my beauteous prize
1349,BOOK I.,"Brisëis, mine by the award of all,"
1350,BOOK I.,"His heralds, at this moment, lead away."
1351,BOOK I.,"But thou, wherein thou canst, aid thy own son!485"
1352,BOOK I.,"Haste hence to Heaven, and if thy word or deed"
1353,BOOK I.,"Hath ever gratified the heart of Jove,"
1354,BOOK I.,With earnest suit press him on my behalf.
1355,BOOK I.,"For I, not seldom, in my father’s hall"
1356,BOOK I.,"Have heard thee boasting, how when once the Gods,490"

1360,BOOK I.,"The Hundred-handed warrior, by the Gods"
1361,BOOK I.,"Briareus, but by men, Ægeon named.[26]495"

1367,BOOK I.,"Now, therefore, of these things reminding Jove,"

1376,BOOK I.,"To him, with streaming eyes, Thetis replied.510"
1377,BOOK I.,"Born as thou wast to sorrow, ah, my son!"
1378,BOOK I.,"Why have I rear’d thee! Would that without tears,"

1384,BOOK I.,"But seeking the Olympian hill snow-crown’d,"

1391,BOOK I.,"He journey’d yesterday, with whom the Gods525"

1396,BOOK I.,"So saying, she went; but him she left enraged530"
1397,BOOK I.,"For fair Brisëis’ sake, forced from his arms"

1399,BOOK I.,To Chrysa with the Hecatomb in charge.
1400,BOOK I.,"Arrived within the haven[30] deep, their sails"
1401,BOOK I.,"Furling, they stowed them in the bark below.535"
1402,BOOK I.,Then by its tackle lowering swift the mast
1403,BOOK I.,"Into its crutch, they briskly push’d to land,"
1404,BOOK I.,"Heaved anchors out, and moor’d the vessel fast."
1405,BOOK I.,"Forth came the mariners, and trod the beach;"
1406,BOOK I.,"Forth came the victims of Apollo next,540"
1407,BOOK I.,"And, last, Chrysëis. Her Ulysses led"

1410,BOOK I.,"O Chryses! Agamemnon, King of men,"
1411,BOOK I.,"Hath sent thy daughter home, with whom we bring545"

1415,BOOK I.,"So saying, he gave her to him, who with joy"

1625,BOOK I.,pestilence sent by the god upon the Grecian army in consequence.
1626,BOOK I.,"Secondly, the restoration, the propitiation of Apollo, the quarrel of"
1627,BOOK I.,"Agamemnon and Achilles, and the withdrawing of the latter from the"
1628,BOOK I.,"Grecian army. Thirdly, the intercession of Thetis with Jupiter; his"
1629,BOOK I.,"promise, unwillingly given, to avenge Achilles; and the assembly of the"
1630,BOOK I.,"gods, in which the promise is angrily alluded to by Juno, and the"
1631,BOOK I.,"discussion peremptorily checked by Jupiter. The poet, throughout this"
1632,BOOK I.,"book, maintains a simple, unadorned style, but highly descriptive, and"
1633,BOOK I.,happily adapted to the nature of the subject.—Felton.

1806,BOOK II.,"So far the Achaians, in my thought, surpass"
1807,BOOK II.,The native Trojans. But in Troy are those
1808,BOOK II.,Who baffle much my purpose; aids derived
1809,BOOK II.,"From other states, spear-arm’d auxiliars, firm155"
1810,BOOK II.,In the defence of Ilium’s lofty towers.
1811,BOOK II.,"Nine years have passed us over, nine long years;"
1812,BOOK II.,"Our ships are rotted, and our tackle marr’d,"
1813,BOOK II.,And all our wives and little-ones at home
1814,BOOK II.,"Sit watching our return, while this attempt160"
1815,BOOK II.,"Hangs still in doubt, for which that home we left."
1816,BOOK II.,Accept ye then my counsel. Fly we swift
1817,BOOK II.,"With all our fleet back to our native land,"
1818,BOOK II.,"Hopeless of Troy, not yet to be subdued."
1819,BOOK II.,"So spake the King, whom all the concourse heard165"
1820,BOOK II.,"With minds in tumult toss’d; all, save the few,"
1821,BOOK II.,Partners of his intent. Commotion shook
1822,BOOK II.,"The whole assembly, such as heaves the flood"
1823,BOOK II.,"Of the Icarian Deep, when South and East"
1824,BOOK II.,Burst forth together from the clouds of Jove.170
1825,BOOK II.,And as when vehement the West-wind falls
1826,BOOK II.,"On standing corn mature, the loaded ears"
1827,BOOK II.,"Innumerable bow before the gale,"
1828,BOOK II.,So was the council shaken. With a shout
1829,BOOK II.,"All flew toward the ships; uprais’d, the dust175"
1830,BOOK II.,"Stood o’er them; universal was the cry,"
1831,BOOK II.,"“Now clear the passages, strike down the props,"
1832,BOOK II.,"Set every vessel free, launch, and away!”"
1833,BOOK II.,Heaven rang with exclamation of the host
1834,BOOK II.,"All homeward bent, and launching glad the fleet.180"
1835,BOOK II.,Then baffled Fate had the Achaians seen
1836,BOOK II.,"Returning premature, but Juno thus,"
1837,BOOK II.,With admonition quick to Pallas spake.
1838,BOOK II.,Unconquer’d daughter of Jove Ægis-arm’d!
1839,BOOK II.,Ah foul dishonor! Is it thus at last185
1840,BOOK II.,"That the Achaians on the billows borne,"
1841,BOOK II.,"Shall seek again their country, leaving here,"
1842,BOOK II.,"To be the vaunt of Ilium and her King,"
1843,BOOK II.,"Helen of Argos, in whose cause the Greeks"
1844,BOOK II.,Have numerous perish’d from their home remote?190
1845,BOOK II.,"Haste! Seek the mail-arm’d multitude, by force"
1846,BOOK II.,"Detain them of thy soothing speech, ere yet"
1847,BOOK II.,All launch their oary barks into the flood.
1848,BOOK II.,"She spake, nor did Minerva not comply,"
1849,BOOK II.,"But darting swift from the Olympian heights,195"
1850,BOOK II.,"Reach’d soon Achaia’s fleet. There, she perceived"
1851,BOOK II.,"Prudent as Jove himself, Ulysses; firm"
1852,BOOK II.,He stood; he touch’d not even with his hand
1853,BOOK II.,"His sable bark, for sorrow whelm’d his soul."
1854,BOOK II.,The Athenæan Goddess azure-eyed200
1855,BOOK II.,"Beside him stood, and thus the Chief bespake."
1856,BOOK II.,"Laertes’ noble son, for wiles renown’d!"
1857,BOOK II.,"Why seek ye, thus precipitate, your ships?"
1858,BOOK II.,"Intend ye flight? And is it thus at last,"
1859,BOOK II.,"That the Achaians on the billows borne,205"
1860,BOOK II.,"Shall seek again their country, leaving here,"
1861,BOOK II.,"To be the vaunt of Ilium and her King,"
1862,BOOK II.,"Helen of Argos, in whose cause the Greeks"
1863,BOOK II.,Have numerous perish’d from their home remote?
1864,BOOK II.,Delay not. Rush into the throng; by force210
1865,BOOK II.,"Detain them of thy soothing speech, ere yet"
1866,BOOK II.,All launch their oary barks into the flood.
1867,BOOK II.,"She ceased, whom by her voice Ulysses knew,"
1868,BOOK II.,"Casting his mantle from him, which his friend"
1869,BOOK II.,"Eurybates the Ithacensian caught,215"
1870,BOOK II.,He ran; and in his course meeting the son
1871,BOOK II.,"Of Atreus, Agamemnon, from his hand"
1872,BOOK II.,"The everlasting sceptre quick received,"
1873,BOOK II.,"Which bearing, through Achaia’s fleet he pass’d."
1874,BOOK II.,"What King soever, or distinguish’d Greek220"
1875,BOOK II.,"He found, approaching to his side, in terms"
1876,BOOK II.,"Of gentle sort he stay’d him. Sir, he cried,"
1877,BOOK II.,It is unseemly that a man renown’d
1878,BOOK II.,"As thou, should tremble. Go—Resume the seat"
1879,BOOK II.,"Which thou hast left, and bid the people sit.225"
1880,BOOK II.,Thou know’st not clearly yet the monarch’s mind.
1881,BOOK II.,"He proves us now, but soon he will chastize."
1882,BOOK II.,All were not present; few of us have heard
1883,BOOK II.,"His speech this day in council. Oh, beware,"
1884,BOOK II.,Lest in resentment of this hasty course230
1885,BOOK II.,"Irregular, he let his anger loose."
1886,BOOK II.,Dread is the anger of a King; he reigns
1887,BOOK II.,"By Jove’s own ordinance, and is dear to Jove,"
1888,BOOK II.,But what plebeian base soe’er he heard
1889,BOOK II.,"Stretching his throat to swell the general cry,235"
1890,BOOK II.,"He laid the sceptre smartly on his back,"
1891,BOOK II.,"With reprimand severe. Fellow, he said,"
1892,BOOK II.,Sit still; hear others; thy superiors hear.
1893,BOOK II.,"For who art thou? A dastard and a drone,"
1894,BOOK II.,"Of none account in council, or in arms.240"
1895,BOOK II.,By no means may we all alike bear sway
1896,BOOK II.,At Ilium; such plurality of Kings
1897,BOOK II.,"Were evil. One suffices. One, to whom"
1898,BOOK II.,The son of politic Saturn hath assign’d
1899,BOOK II.,"The sceptre, and inforcement of the laws,245"
1900,BOOK II.,That he may rule us as a monarch ought.[8]
1901,BOOK II.,With such authority the troubled host
1902,BOOK II.,"He sway’d; they, quitting camp and fleet again"
1903,BOOK II.,Rush’d back to council; deafening was the sound
1904,BOOK II.,As when a billow of the boisterous deep250
1905,BOOK II.,"Some broad beach dashes, and the Ocean roars."
1906,BOOK II.,"The host all seated, and the benches fill’d,"
1907,BOOK II.,Thersites only of loquacious tongue
1908,BOOK II.,"Ungovern’d, clamor’d mutinous; a wretch"
1909,BOOK II.,"Of utterance prompt, but in coarse phrase obscene255"
1910,BOOK II.,"Deep learn’d alone, with which to slander Kings."
1911,BOOK II.,"Might he but set the rabble in a roar,"
1912,BOOK II.,He cared not with what jest; of all from Greece
1913,BOOK II.,"To Ilium sent, his country’s chief reproach."
1914,BOOK II.,"Cross-eyed he was, and halting moved on legs260"
1915,BOOK II.,Ill-pair’d; his gibbous shoulders o’er his breast
1916,BOOK II.,"Contracted, pinch’d it; to a peak his head"
1917,BOOK II.,"Was moulded sharp, and sprinkled thin with hair"
1918,BOOK II.,"Of starveling length, flimsy and soft as down."
1919,BOOK II.,Achilles and Ulysses had incurr’d265
1920,BOOK II.,Most his aversion; them he never spared;
1921,BOOK II.,"But now, imperial Agamemnon self"
1922,BOOK II.,In piercing accents stridulous he charged
1923,BOOK II.,With foul reproach. The Grecians with contempt
1924,BOOK II.,"Listen’d, and indignation, while with voice270"
1925,BOOK II.,"At highest pitch, he thus the monarch mock’d."
1926,BOOK II.,What wouldst thou now? Whereof is thy complaint
1927,BOOK II.,"Now, Agamemnon? Thou hast fill’d thy tents"
1928,BOOK II.,"With treasure, and the Grecians, when they take"
1929,BOOK II.,"A city, choose the loveliest girls for thee.275"
1930,BOOK II.,Is gold thy wish? More gold? A ransom brought
1931,BOOK II.,By some chief Trojan for his son’s release
1932,BOOK II.,"Whom I, or other valiant Greek may bind?"
1933,BOOK II.,"Or wouldst thou yet a virgin, one, by right"
1934,BOOK II.,"Another’s claim, but made by force thine own?280"
1935,BOOK II.,"It was not well, great Sir, that thou shouldst bring"
1936,BOOK II.,"A plague on the Achaians, as of late."
1937,BOOK II.,"But come, my Grecian sisters, soldiers named"
1938,BOOK II.,"Unfitly, of a sex too soft for war,"
1939,BOOK II.,"Come, let us homeward: let him here digest285"
1940,BOOK II.,"What he shall gorge, alone; that he may learn"
1941,BOOK II.,If our assistance profit him or not.
1942,BOOK II.,"For when he shamed Achilles, he disgraced"
1943,BOOK II.,"A Chief far worthier than himself, whose prize"
1944,BOOK II.,"He now withholds. But tush,—Achilles lacks290"
1945,BOOK II.,Himself the spirit of a man; no gall
1946,BOOK II.,"Hath he within him, or his hand long since"
1947,BOOK II.,"Had stopp’d that mouth,[9] that it should scoff no more."
1948,BOOK II.,"Thus, mocking royal Agamemnon, spake"
1949,BOOK II.,"Thersites. Instant starting to his side, 295"
1950,BOOK II.,Noble Ulysses with indignant brows
1951,BOOK II.,"Survey’d him, and him thus reproved severe."
1952,BOOK II.,
1953,BOOK II.,"Thersites! Railer!—peace. Think not thyself,"
1954,BOOK II.,"Although thus eloquent, alone exempt"
1955,BOOK II.,From obligation not to slander Kings.300
1956,BOOK II.,"I deem thee most contemptible, the worst"
1957,BOOK II.,Of Agamemnon’s followers to the war;
1958,BOOK II.,Presume not then to take the names revered
1959,BOOK II.,"Of Sovereigns on thy sordid lips, to asperse"
1960,BOOK II.,"Their sacred character, and to appoint305"
1961,BOOK II.,The Greeks a time when they shall voyage home.
1962,BOOK II.,"How soon, how late, with what success at last"
1963,BOOK II.,"We shall return, we know not: but because"
1964,BOOK II.,Achaia’s heroes numerous spoils allot
1965,BOOK II.,"To Agamemnon, Leader of the host,310"
1966,BOOK II.,Thou therefore from thy seat revilest the King.
1967,BOOK II.,"But mark me. If I find thee, as even now,"
1968,BOOK II.,"Raving and foaming at the lips again,"
1969,BOOK II.,May never man behold Ulysses’ head
1970,BOOK II.,"On these my shoulders more, and may my son315"
1971,BOOK II.,"Prove the begotten of another Sire,"
1972,BOOK II.,If I not strip thee to that hide of thine
1973,BOOK II.,"As bare as thou wast born, and whip thee hence"
1974,BOOK II.,"Home to thy galley, sniveling like a boy."
1975,BOOK II.,"He ceased, and with his sceptre on the back320"
1976,BOOK II.,"And shoulders smote him. Writhing to and fro,"
1977,BOOK II.,"He wept profuse, while many a bloody whelk"
1978,BOOK II.,Protuberant beneath the sceptre sprang.
1979,BOOK II.,"Awe-quell’d he sat, and from his visage mean,"
1980,BOOK II.,"Deep-sighing, wiped the rheums. It was no time325"
1981,BOOK II.,"For mirth, yet mirth illumined every face,"
1982,BOOK II.,"And laughing, thus they spake. A thousand acts"
1983,BOOK II.,"Illustrious, both by well-concerted plans"
1984,BOOK II.,And prudent disposition of the host
1985,BOOK II.,"Ulysses hath achieved, but this by far330"
1986,BOOK II.,"Transcends his former praise, that he hath quell’d"
1987,BOOK II.,Such contumelious rhetoric profuse.
1988,BOOK II.,"The valiant talker shall not soon, we judge,"
1989,BOOK II.,Take liberties with royal names again.[10]
1990,BOOK II.,"So spake the multitude. Then, stretching forth335"
1991,BOOK II.,"The sceptre, city-spoiler Chief, arose"
1992,BOOK II.,"Ulysses. Him beside, herald in form,"
1993,BOOK II.,Appeared Minerva. Silence she enjoined
1994,BOOK II.,"To all, that all Achaia’s sons might hear,"
1995,BOOK II.,"Foremost and rearmost, and might weigh his words.340"
1996,BOOK II.,"He then his counsel, prudent, thus proposed."
1997,BOOK II.,Atrides! Monarch! The Achaians seek
1998,BOOK II.,To make thee ignominious above all
1999,BOOK II.,In sight of all mankind. None recollects
2000,BOOK II.,"His promise more in steed-famed Argos pledged,345"
2001,BOOK II.,Here to abide till Ilium wall’d to heaven
2002,BOOK II.,"Should vanquish’d sink, and all her wealth be ours."
2003,BOOK II.,"No—now, like widow’d women, or weak boys,"
2004,BOOK II.,"They whimper to each other, wishing home."
2005,BOOK II.,"And home, I grant, to the afflicted soul350"
2006,BOOK II.,Seems pleasant.[11] The poor seaman from his wife
2007,BOOK II.,"One month detain’d, cheerless his ship and sad"
2008,BOOK II.,"Possesses, by the force of wintry blasts,"
2009,BOOK II.,And by the billows of the troubled deep
2010,BOOK II.,Fast lock’d in port. But us the ninth long year355
2011,BOOK II.,"Revolving, finds camp’d under Ilium still."
2012,BOOK II.,"I therefore blame not, if they mourn beside"
2013,BOOK II.,"Their sable barks, the Grecians. Yet the shame"
2014,BOOK II.,That must attend us after absence long
2015,BOOK II.,"Returning unsuccessful, who can bear?360"
2016,BOOK II.,"Be patient, friends! wait only till we learn"
2017,BOOK II.,"If Calchas truly prophesied, or not;"
2018,BOOK II.,"For well we know, and I to all appeal,"
2019,BOOK II.,"Whom Fate hath not already snatch’d away,"
2020,BOOK II.,"(It seems but yesterday, or at the most365"
2021,BOOK II.,A day or two before) that when the ships
2022,BOOK II.,"Wo-fraught for Priam, and the race of Troy,"
2023,BOOK II.,"At Aulis met, and we beside the fount"
2024,BOOK II.,With perfect hecatombs the Gods adored
2025,BOOK II.,"Beneath the plane-tree, from whose root a stream370"
2026,BOOK II.,"Ran crystal-clear, there we beheld a sign"
2027,BOOK II.,"Wonderful in all eyes. A serpent huge,"
2028,BOOK II.,Tremendous spectacle! with crimson spots
2029,BOOK II.,"His back all dappled, by Olympian Jove"
2030,BOOK II.,"Himself protruded, from the altar’s foot375"
2031,BOOK II.,"Slipp’d into light, and glided to the tree."
2032,BOOK II.,"There on the topmost bough, close-cover’d sat"
2033,BOOK II.,"With foliage broad, eight sparrows, younglings all,"
2034,BOOK II.,"Then newly feather’d, with their dam, the ninth."
2035,BOOK II.,"The little ones lamenting shrill he gorged,380"
2036,BOOK II.,"While, wheeling o’er his head, with screams the dam"
2037,BOOK II.,"Bewail’d her darling brood. Her also next,"
2038,BOOK II.,"Hovering and clamoring, he by the wing"
2039,BOOK II.,"Within his spiry folds drew, and devoured."
2040,BOOK II.,"All eaten thus, the nestlings and the dam,385"
2041,BOOK II.,"The God who sent him, signalized him too,"
2042,BOOK II.,For him Saturnian Jove transform’d to stone.
2043,BOOK II.,"We wondering stood, to see that strange portent"
2044,BOOK II.,"Intrude itself into our holy rites,"
2045,BOOK II.,"When Calchas, instant, thus the sign explain’d.390"
2046,BOOK II.,"Why stand ye, Greeks, astonish’d? Ye behold"
2047,BOOK II.,"A prodigy by Jove himself produced,"
2048,BOOK II.,"An omen, whose accomplishment indeed"
2049,BOOK II.,"Is distant, but whose fame shall never die.[12]"
2050,BOOK II.,E’en as this serpent in your sight devour’d395
2051,BOOK II.,"Eight youngling sparrows, with their dam, the ninth,"
2052,BOOK II.,"So we nine years must war on yonder plain,"
2053,BOOK II.,"And in the tenth, wide-bulwark’d Troy is ours."
2054,BOOK II.,"So spake the seer, and as he spake, is done."
2055,BOOK II.,"Wait, therefore, brave Achaians! go not hence400"
2056,BOOK II.,Till Priam’s spacious city be your prize.
2057,BOOK II.,"He ceased, and such a shout ensued, that all"
2058,BOOK II.,The hollow ships the deafening roar return’d
2059,BOOK II.,"Of acclamation, every voice the speech"
2060,BOOK II.,"Extolling of Ulysses, glorious Chief.405"
2061,BOOK II.,"Then Nestor the Gerenian,[13] warrior old,"
2062,BOOK II.,"Arising, spake; and, by the Gods, he said,"
2063,BOOK II.,Ye more resemble children inexpert
2064,BOOK II.,"In war, than disciplined and prudent men."
2065,BOOK II.,"Where now are all your promises and vows,410"
2066,BOOK II.,"Councils, libations, right-hand covenants?[14]"
2067,BOOK II.,"Burn them, since all our occupation here"
2068,BOOK II.,"Is to debate and wrangle, whereof end"
2069,BOOK II.,"Or fruit though long we wait, shall none be found."
2070,BOOK II.,"But, Sovereign, be not thou appall’d. Be firm.415"
2071,BOOK II.,"Relax not aught of thine accustomed sway,"
2072,BOOK II.,But set the battle forth as thou art wont.
2073,BOOK II.,"And if there be a Grecian, here and there,"
2074,BOOK II.,"One,[15] adverse to the general voice, let such"
2075,BOOK II.,Wither alone. He shall not see his wish420
2076,BOOK II.,"Gratified, neither will we hence return"
2077,BOOK II.,"To Argos, ere events shall yet have proved"
2078,BOOK II.,Jove’s promise false or true. For when we climb’d
2079,BOOK II.,"Our gallant barks full-charged with Ilium’s fate,"
2080,BOOK II.,"Saturnian Jove omnipotent, that day,425"
2081,BOOK II.,(Omen propitious!) thunder’d on the right.
2082,BOOK II.,"Let no man therefore pant for home, till each"
2083,BOOK II.,"Possess a Trojan spouse, and from her lips"
2084,BOOK II.,Take sweet revenge for Helen’s pangs of heart.
2085,BOOK II.,Who then? What soldier languishes and sighs430
2086,BOOK II.,To leave us? Let him dare to lay his hand
2087,BOOK II.,"On his own vessel, and he dies the first."
2088,BOOK II.,"But hear, O King! I shall suggest a course"
2089,BOOK II.,Not trivial. Agamemnon! sort the Greeks
2090,BOOK II.,"By districts and by tribes, that tribe may tribe435"
2091,BOOK II.,"Support, and each his fellow. This performed,"
2092,BOOK II.,"And with consent of all, thou shalt discern"
2093,BOOK II.,"With ease what Chief, what private man deserts,"
2094,BOOK II.,"And who performs his part. The base, the brave,"
2095,BOOK II.,"Such disposition made, shall both appear;440"
2096,BOOK II.,"And thou shalt also know, if heaven or we,"
2097,BOOK II.,"The Gods, or our supineness, succor Troy."
2098,BOOK II.,"To whom Atrides, King of men, replied."
2099,BOOK II.,Old Chief! Thou passest all Achaia’s sons
2100,BOOK II.,"In consultation; would to Jove our Sire,445"
2101,BOOK II.,"To Athenæan Pallas, and Apollo!"
2102,BOOK II.,"That I had ten such coadjutors, wise"
2103,BOOK II.,"As thou art, and the royal city soon"
2104,BOOK II.,"Of Priam, with her wealth, should all be ours.[16]"
2105,BOOK II.,"But me the son of Saturn, Jove supreme450"
2106,BOOK II.,"Himself afflicts, who in contentious broils"
2107,BOOK II.,"Involves me, and in altercation vain."
2108,BOOK II.,Thence all that wordy tempest for a girl
2109,BOOK II.,"Achilles and myself between, and I"
2110,BOOK II.,The fierce aggressor. Be that breach but heal’d!455
2111,BOOK II.,And Troy’s reprieve thenceforth is at an end.
2112,BOOK II.,Go—take refreshment now that we may march
2113,BOOK II.,Forth to our enemies. Let each whet well
2114,BOOK II.,"His spear, brace well his shield, well feed his brisk"
2115,BOOK II.,"High-mettled horses, well survey and search460"
2116,BOOK II.,"His chariot on all sides, that no defect"
2117,BOOK II.,Disgrace his bright habiliments of war.
2118,BOOK II.,So will we give the day from morn to eve
2119,BOOK II.,To dreadful battle. Pause there shall be none
2120,BOOK II.,Till night divide us. Every buckler’s thong465
2121,BOOK II.,"Shall sweat on the toil’d bosom, every hand"
2122,BOOK II.,"That shakes the spear shall ache, and every steed"
2123,BOOK II.,Shall smoke that whirls the chariot o’er the plain.
2124,BOOK II.,Wo then to whom I shall discover here
2125,BOOK II.,Loitering among the tents; let him escape470
2126,BOOK II.,My vengeance if he can. The vulture’s maw
2127,BOOK II.,"Shall have his carcase, and the dogs his bones."
2128,BOOK II.,He spake; whom all applauded with a shout
2129,BOOK II.,Loud as against some headland cliff the waves
2130,BOOK II.,Roll’d by the stormy South o’er rocks that shoot475
2131,BOOK II.,"Afar into the deep, which in all winds"
2132,BOOK II.,"The flood still overspreads, blow whence they may."
2133,BOOK II.,"Arising, forth they rush’d, among the ships"
2134,BOOK II.,"All scatter’d; smoke from every tent arose,"
2135,BOOK II.,"The host their food preparing; next, his God480"
2136,BOOK II.,Each man invoked (of the Immortals him
2137,BOOK II.,Whom he preferr’d) with sacrifice and prayer
2138,BOOK II.,For safe escape from danger and from death.
2139,BOOK II.,But Agamemnon to Saturnian Jove
2140,BOOK II.,"Omnipotent, an ox of the fifth year485"
2141,BOOK II.,"Full-flesh’d devoted, and the Princes call’d"
2142,BOOK II.,Noblest of all the Grecians to his feast.

2148,BOOK II.,His brother’s mind with weight of care oppress’d.
2149,BOOK II.,"The ox encircling, and their hands with meal"
2150,BOOK II.,"Of consecration fill’d, the assembly stood,495"
2151,BOOK II.,When Agamemnon thus his prayer preferred.
2152,BOOK II.,Almighty Father! Glorious above all!
2153,BOOK II.,"Cloud-girt, who dwell’st in heaven thy throne sublime,"
2154,BOOK II.,"Let not the sun go down, till Priam’s roof"
2155,BOOK II.,Fall flat into the flames; till I shall burn500
2156,BOOK II.,His gates with fire; till I shall hew away
2157,BOOK II.,His hack’d and riven corslet from the breast
2158,BOOK II.,"Of Hector, and till numerous Chiefs, his friends,"
2159,BOOK II.,"Around him, prone in dust, shall bite the ground."
2160,BOOK II.,"So prayed he, but with none effect, The God505"
2161,BOOK II.,"Received his offering, but to double toil"
2162,BOOK II.,"Doom’d them, and sorrow more than all the past."
2163,BOOK II.,"They then, the triturated barley grain"

2165,BOOK II.,"Deep in the victim’s neck reversed, then stripp’d510"

2169,BOOK II.,Ascending fierce from billets sere and dry.
2170,BOOK II.,The spitted entrails next they o’er the coals515
2171,BOOK II.,"Suspended held. The thighs with fire consumed,"
2172,BOOK II.,"They gave to each his portion of the maw,"
2173,BOOK II.,"Then slash’d the remnant, pierced it with the spits,"
2174,BOOK II.,And managing with culinary skill
2175,BOOK II.,"The roast, withdrew it from the spits again.520"
2176,BOOK II.,"Thus, all their task accomplished, and the board"
2177,BOOK II.,"Set forth, they feasted, and were all sufficed."
2178,BOOK II.,When neither hunger more nor thirst remain’d
2179,BOOK II.,"Unsatisfied, Gerenian Nestor spake."
2180,BOOK II.,Atrides! Agamemnon! King of men!525
2181,BOOK II.,"No longer waste we time in useless words,"
2182,BOOK II.,Nor to a distant hour postpone the work
2183,BOOK II.,To which heaven calls thee. Send thine heralds forth.
2184,BOOK II.,"Who shall convene the Achaians at the fleet,"
2185,BOOK II.,"That we, the Chiefs assembled here, may range,530"
2186,BOOK II.,"Together, the imbattled multitude,"
2187,BOOK II.,And edge their spirits for immediate fight.
2188,BOOK II.,"He spake, nor Agamemnon not complied."
2189,BOOK II.,At once he bade his clear-voiced heralds call
2190,BOOK II.,The Greeks to battle. They the summons loud535
2191,BOOK II.,"Gave forth, and at the sound the people throng’d."
2192,BOOK II.,Then Agamemnon and the Kings of Greece
2193,BOOK II.,"Dispatchful drew them into order just,"
2194,BOOK II.,"With whom Minerva azure-eyed advanced,"
2195,BOOK II.,"The inestimable Ægis on her arm,540"
2196,BOOK II.,"Immortal, unobnoxious to decay"
2197,BOOK II.,"A hundred braids, close twisted, all of gold,"
2198,BOOK II.,"Each valued at a hundred beeves,[17] around"
2199,BOOK II.,Dependent fringed it. She from side to side
2200,BOOK II.,"Her eyes cerulean rolled, infusing thirst545"
2201,BOOK II.,Of battle endless into every breast.
2202,BOOK II.,"War won them now, war sweeter now to each"
2203,BOOK II.,Than gales to waft them over ocean home.[18]
2204,BOOK II.,As when devouring flames some forest seize
2205,BOOK II.,"On the high mountains, splendid from afar550"
2206,BOOK II.,"The blaze appears, so, moving on the plain,"
2207,BOOK II.,The steel-clad host innumerous flash’d to heaven.
2208,BOOK II.,And as a multitude of fowls in flocks
2209,BOOK II.,"Assembled various, geese, or cranes, or swans"
2210,BOOK II.,"Lithe-neck’d, long hovering o’er Caÿster’s banks555"
2211,BOOK II.,"On wanton plumes, successive on the mead"
2212,BOOK II.,"Alight at last, and with a clang so loud"
2213,BOOK II.,That all the hollow vale of Asius rings;
2214,BOOK II.,"In number such from ships and tents effused,"
2215,BOOK II.,They cover’d the Scamandrian plain; the earth560
2216,BOOK II.,Rebellow’d to the feet of steeds and men.
2217,BOOK II.,"They overspread Scamander’s grassy vale,"
2218,BOOK II.,"Myriads, as leaves, or as the flowers of spring."
2219,BOOK II.,As in the hovel where the peasant milks
2220,BOOK II.,"His kine in spring-time, when his pails are fill’d,565"
2221,BOOK II.,Thick clouds of humming insects on the wing
2222,BOOK II.,"Swarm all around him, so the Grecians swarm’d"
2223,BOOK II.,"An unsumm’d multitude o’er all the plain,"
2224,BOOK II.,"Bright arm’d, high crested, and athirst for war."
2225,BOOK II.,As goat-herds separate their numerous flocks570
2226,BOOK II.,"With ease, though fed promiscuous, with like ease"
2227,BOOK II.,Their leaders them on every side reduced
2228,BOOK II.,To martial order glorious;[19] among whom
2229,BOOK II.,"Stood Agamemnon “with an eye like Jove’s,"
2230,BOOK II.,"To threaten or command,” like Mars in girth,575"
2231,BOOK II.,And with the port of Neptune. As the bull
2232,BOOK II.,"Conspicuous among all the herd appears,"
2233,BOOK II.,"For he surpasses all, such Jove ordain’d"
2234,BOOK II.,"That day the son of Atreus, in the midst"

2239,BOOK II.,"Tell me, ye Muses, under whom, beneath"
2240,BOOK II.,What Chiefs of royal or of humbler note585
2241,BOOK II.,Stood forth the embattled Greeks? The host at large;
2242,BOOK II.,_They_ were a multitude in number more
2243,BOOK II.,"Than with ten tongues, and with ten mouths, each mouth"
2244,BOOK II.,Made vocal with a trumpet’s throat of brass
2245,BOOK II.,"I might declare, unless the Olympian nine,590"
2246,BOOK II.,"Jove’s daughters, would the chronicle themselves"
2247,BOOK II.,"Indite, of all assembled, under Troy."

2271,BOOK II.,These in Bœotia’s fair and gallant fleet
2272,BOOK II.,"Of fifty ships, each bearing o’er the waves"

2372,BOOK II.,"Conscious of dauntless might he pass’d, and sent"
2373,BOOK II.,Into all hearts the fervor of his own.
2374,BOOK II.,Gerenian Nestor in thrice thirty ships
2375,BOOK II.,"Had brought his warriors; they from Pylus came,720"
2376,BOOK II.,"From blithe Arene, and from Thryos, built"

2388,BOOK II.,"They therefore, by his boast incensed, the bard"

2534,BOOK II.,"Methone, and Olizon’s craggy coast,"
2535,BOOK II.,With Melibœa and Thaumasia sent880
2536,BOOK II.,"Seven ships; their rowers were good archers all,"
2537,BOOK II.,And every vessel dipped into the wave
2538,BOOK II.,"Her fifty oars. Them Philoctetes, skill’d"
2539,BOOK II.,"To draw with sinewy arm the stubborn bow,"
2540,BOOK II.,Commanded; but he suffering anguish keen885
2541,BOOK II.,"Inflicted by a serpent’s venom’d tooth,"
2542,BOOK II.,Lay sick in Lemnos; him the Grecians there
2543,BOOK II.,"Had left sore-wounded, but were destined soon"
2544,BOOK II.,To call to dear remembrance whom they left.
2545,BOOK II.,"Meantime, though sorrowing for his sake, his troops890"
2546,BOOK II.,"Yet wanted not a chief; them Medon ruled,"
2547,BOOK II.,Whom Rhena to the far-famed conqueror bore
2548,BOOK II.,"Oïleus, fruit of their unsanction’d loves."
2549,BOOK II.,"From Tricca, from Ithome rough and rude"

2564,BOOK II.,"Him, to Pirithoüs, (on the self-same day"

2566,BOOK II.,Sheer to Æthicæ driven from Pelion’s heights
2567,BOOK II.,The shaggy race) Hippodamia bore.
2568,BOOK II.,Nor he alone them led. With him was join’d

2571,BOOK II.,Twice twenty ships awaited their command.
2572,BOOK II.,Guneus from Cyphus twenty and two ships
2573,BOOK II.,"Led forth; the Enienes him obey’d,"
2574,BOOK II.,"And the robust Perœbi, warriors bold,"
2575,BOOK II.,And dwellers on Dodona’s wintry brow.920
2576,BOOK II.,To these were join’d who till the pleasant fields
2577,BOOK II.,Where Titaresius winds; the gentle flood
2578,BOOK II.,"Pours into Peneus all his limpid stores,"
2579,BOOK II.,But with the silver-eddied Peneus flows
2580,BOOK II.,"Unmixt as oil;[27] for Stygian is his stream,925"
2581,BOOK II.,And Styx is the inviolable oath.
2582,BOOK II.,"Last with his forty ships, Tenthredon’s son,"
2583,BOOK II.,The active Prothoüs came. From the green banks
2584,BOOK II.,Of Peneus his Magnesians far and near
2585,BOOK II.,"He gather’d, and from Pelion forest-crown’d.930"
2586,BOOK II.,These were the princes and the Chiefs of Greece.
2587,BOOK II.,"Say, Muse, who most in personal desert"
2588,BOOK II.,"Excell’d, and whose were the most warlike steeds"
2589,BOOK II.,"And of the noblest strain. Their hue, their age,"
2590,BOOK II.,"Their height the same, swift as the winds of heaven935"
2591,BOOK II.,"And passing far all others, were the mares"
2592,BOOK II.,Which drew Eumelus; on Pierian hills
2593,BOOK II.,"The heavenly Archer of the silver bow,"
2594,BOOK II.,"Apollo, bred them. But of men, the chief"
2595,BOOK II.,"Was Telamonian Ajax, while wrath-bound940"
2596,BOOK II.,"Achilles lay; for he was worthier far,"
2597,BOOK II.,And more illustrious were the steeds which bore
2598,BOOK II.,The noble son of Peleus; but revenge
2599,BOOK II.,On Agamemnon leader of the host
2600,BOOK II.,"Was all his thought, while in his gallant ships945"
2601,BOOK II.,"Sharp-keel’d to cut the foaming flood, he lay."
2602,BOOK II.,"Meantime, along the margin of the deep"
2603,BOOK II.,"His soldiers hurled the disk, or bent the bow."
2604,BOOK II.,Or to its mark dispatch’d the quivering lance.
2605,BOOK II.,Beside the chariots stood the unharness’d steeds950
2606,BOOK II.,"Cropping the lotus, or at leisure browsed"
2607,BOOK II.,"On celery wild, from watery freshes gleaned."
2608,BOOK II.,Beneath the shadow of the sheltering tent
2609,BOOK II.,"The chariot stood, while they, the charioteers"
2610,BOOK II.,"Roam’d here and there the camp, their warlike lord955"
2611,BOOK II.,"Regretting sad, and idle for his sake."
2612,BOOK II.,"As if a fire had burnt along the ground,"
2613,BOOK II.,Such seem’d their march; earth groan’d their steps beneath;
2614,BOOK II.,"As when in Arimi, where fame reports"
2615,BOOK II.,"Typhoëus stretch’d, the fires of angry Jove960"
2616,BOOK II.,"Down darted, lash the ground, so groan’d the earth"
2617,BOOK II.,"Beneath them, for they traversed swift the plain."
2618,BOOK II.,"And now from Jove, with heavy tidings charged,"
2619,BOOK II.,Wind-footed Iris to the Trojans came.
2620,BOOK II.,"It was the time of council, when the throng965"
2621,BOOK II.,"At Priam’s gate assembled, young and old:"
2622,BOOK II.,"Them, standing nigh, the messenger of heaven"
2623,BOOK II.,"Accosted with the voice of Priam’s son,"
2624,BOOK II.,"Polites. He, confiding in his speed"
2625,BOOK II.,"For sure deliverance, posted was abroad970"
2626,BOOK II.,"On Æsyeta’s tomb,[28] intent to watch"
2627,BOOK II.,When the Achaian host should leave the fleet.
2628,BOOK II.,The Goddess in his form thus them address’d.
2629,BOOK II.,"Oh, ancient Monarch! Ever, evermore"
2630,BOOK II.,"Speaking, debating, as if all were peace;975"
2631,BOOK II.,"I have seen many a bright-embattled field,"
2632,BOOK II.,But never one so throng’d as this to-day.
2633,BOOK II.,"For like the leaves, or like the sands they come"
2634,BOOK II.,"Swept by the winds, to gird the city round."
2635,BOOK II.,But Hector! chiefly thee I shall exhort.980
2636,BOOK II.,In Priam’s spacious city are allies
2637,BOOK II.,"Collected numerous, and of nations wide"
2638,BOOK II.,Disseminated various are the tongues.
2639,BOOK II.,"Let every Chief his proper troop command,"
2640,BOOK II.,And marshal his own citizens to war.985
2641,BOOK II.,"She ceased; her Hector heard intelligent,"
2642,BOOK II.,And quick dissolved the council. All took arms.
2643,BOOK II.,"Wide flew the gates; forth rush’d the multitude,"
2644,BOOK II.,"Horsemen and foot, and boisterous stir arose."
2645,BOOK II.,"In front of Ilium, distant on the plain,990"
2646,BOOK II.,"Clear all around from all obstruction, stands"
2647,BOOK II.,"An eminence high-raised, by mortal men"

2649,BOOK II.,Have named it of Myrinna swift in fight.
2650,BOOK II.,Troy and her aids there set the battle forth.995

2659,BOOK II.,"Stood forth, the offspring of Antenor, each,"
2660,BOOK II.,And well instructed in all forms of war.1005
2661,BOOK II.,"Fast by the foot of Ida, where they drank"
2662,BOOK II.,"The limpid waters of Æsepus, dwelt"
2663,BOOK II.,The Trojans of Zeleia. Rich were they

2665,BOOK II.,Whom Phœbus self graced with the bow he bore.1010
2666,BOOK II.,"Apæsus, Adrastea, Terie steep,"
2667,BOOK II.,"And Pitueia—them, Amphius clad"
2668,BOOK II.,"In mail thick-woven, and Adrastus, ruled."
2669,BOOK II.,They were the sons of the Percosian seer
2670,BOOK II.,"Merops, expert in the soothsayers’ art1015"
2671,BOOK II.,Above all other; he his sons forbad

2686,BOOK II.,Heroic Acamas and Pirous led.
2687,BOOK II.,"Euphemus, offspring of Trœzenus, son"

2702,BOOK II.,Epistrophus and Odius from the land
2703,BOOK II.,"Of Alybe, a region far remote,"

2750,BOOK III.,"[1]Now marshall’d all beneath their several chiefs,"
2751,BOOK III.,"With deafening shouts, and with the clang of arms,"
2752,BOOK III.,The host of Troy advanced. Such clang is heard
2753,BOOK III.,"Along the skies, when from incessant showers"
2754,BOOK III.,"Escaping, and from winter’s cold, the cranes5"
2755,BOOK III.,"Take wing, and over Ocean speed away;[2]"
2756,BOOK III.,Wo to the land of dwarfs! prepared they fly
2757,BOOK III.,For slaughter of the small Pygmæan race.
2758,BOOK III.,"Not so the Greeks; they breathing valor came,"
2759,BOOK III.,"But silent all, and all with faithful hearts10"
2760,BOOK III.,"On succor mutual to the last, resolved."
2761,BOOK III.,As when the south wind wraps the mountain top
2762,BOOK III.,"In mist the shepherd’s dread, but to the thief"
2763,BOOK III.,"Than night itself more welcome, and the eye"
2764,BOOK III.,"Is bounded in its ken to a stone’s cast,15"
2765,BOOK III.,Such from beneath their footsteps dun and dense
2766,BOOK III.,"Uprose the dust, for swift they cross the plain."
2767,BOOK III.,
2768,BOOK III.,"When, host to host opposed, full nigh they stood,"
2769,BOOK III.,Then Alexander[3] in the Trojan van
2770,BOOK III.,"Advanced was seen, all beauteous as a God;20"
2771,BOOK III.,"His leopard’s skin, his falchion and his bow"
2772,BOOK III.,Hung from his shoulder; bright with heads of brass
2773,BOOK III.,"He shook two spears, and challenged to the fight"
2774,BOOK III.,"The bravest Argives there, defying all."
2775,BOOK III.,"Him, striding haughtily his host before25"
2776,BOOK III.,"When Menelaus saw, such joy he felt"
2777,BOOK III.,"As hunger-pinch’d the lion feels, by chance"
2778,BOOK III.,"Conducted to some carcase huge, wild goat,"
2779,BOOK III.,Or antler’d stag; huntsmen and baying hounds
2780,BOOK III.,"Disturb not _him_, he gorges in their sight.30"
2781,BOOK III.,So Menelaus at the view rejoiced
2782,BOOK III.,"Of lovely Alexander, for he hoped"
2783,BOOK III.,"His punishment at hand. At once, all armed,"
2784,BOOK III.,Down from his chariot to the ground he leap’d
2785,BOOK III.,When godlike Paris him in front beheld35
2786,BOOK III.,"Conspicuous, his heart smote him, and his fate"
2787,BOOK III.,"Avoiding, far within the lines he shrank.[4]"
2788,BOOK III.,"As one, who in some woodland height descrying"
2789,BOOK III.,"A serpent huge, with sudden start recoils,"
2790,BOOK III.,His limbs shake under him; with cautious step40
2791,BOOK III.,He slow retires; fear blanches cold his cheeks;
2792,BOOK III.,So beauteous Alexander at the sight
2793,BOOK III.,"Of Atreus’ son dishearten’d sore, the ranks"
2794,BOOK III.,Of haughty Trojans enter’d deep again:
2795,BOOK III.,"Him Hector eyed, and thus rebuked severe.45"
2796,BOOK III.,Curst Paris! Fair deceiver! Woman-mad!
2797,BOOK III.,I would to all in heaven that thou hadst died
2798,BOOK III.,"Unborn, at least unmated! happier far"
2799,BOOK III.,Than here to have incurr’d this public shame!
2800,BOOK III.,"Well may the Grecians taunt, and laughing loud,50"
2801,BOOK III.,"Applaud the champion, slow indeed to fight"
2802,BOOK III.,"And pusillanimous, but wondrous fair."
2803,BOOK III.,"Wast thou as timid, tell me, when with those"
2804,BOOK III.,"Thy loved companions in that famed exploit,"
2805,BOOK III.,"Thou didst consort with strangers, and convey55"
2806,BOOK III.,From distant lands a warrior’s beauteous bride
2807,BOOK III.,"To be thy father’s and his people’s curse,"
2808,BOOK III.,"Joy to our foes, but to thyself reproach?"
2809,BOOK III.,Behold her husband! Darest thou not to face
2810,BOOK III.,The warlike prince? Now learn how brave a Chief60
2811,BOOK III.,Thou hast defrauded of his blooming spouse.
2812,BOOK III.,"Thy lyre, thy locks, thy person, specious gifts"
2813,BOOK III.,"Of partial Venus, will avail thee nought,"
2814,BOOK III.,Once mixt by Menelaus with the dust.
2815,BOOK III.,"But we are base ourselves, or long ago,65"
2816,BOOK III.,"For all thy numerous mischiefs, thou hadst slept"
2817,BOOK III.,Secure beneath a coverlet[5] of stone.[6]
2818,BOOK III.,Then godlike Alexander thus replied.
2819,BOOK III.,"Oh Hector, true in temper as the axe"
2820,BOOK III.,Which in the shipwright’s hand the naval plank70
2821,BOOK III.,"Divides resistless, doubling all his force,"
2822,BOOK III.,Such is thy dauntless spirit whose reproach
2823,BOOK III.,"Perforce I own, nor causeless nor unjust."
2824,BOOK III.,Yet let the gracious gifts uncensured pass
2825,BOOK III.,Of golden Venus; man may not reject75
2826,BOOK III.,"The glorious bounty by the Gods bestow’d,"
2827,BOOK III.,Nor follows their beneficence our choice.
2828,BOOK III.,But if thy pleasure be that I engage
2829,BOOK III.,With Menelaus in decision fierce
2830,BOOK III.,Of desperate combat bid the host of Troy80
2831,BOOK III.,And bid the Grecians sit; then face to face
2832,BOOK III.,"Commit us, in the vacant field between,"
2833,BOOK III.,To fight for Helen and for all her wealth.
2834,BOOK III.,"Who strongest proves, and conquers, he, of her"
2835,BOOK III.,And hers possess’d shall bear them safe away;85
2836,BOOK III.,While ye (peace sworn and firm accord) shall dwell
2837,BOOK III.,"At Troy, and these to Argos shall return"
2838,BOOK III.,And to Achaia praised for women fair.
2839,BOOK III.,"He ceased, whom Hector heard with joy; he moved"
2840,BOOK III.,"Into the middle space, and with his spear90"
2841,BOOK III.,"Advanced athwart push’d back the Trojan van,"
2842,BOOK III.,And all stood fast. Meantime at him the Greeks
2843,BOOK III.,"Discharged full volley, showering thick around"
2844,BOOK III.,From bow and sling;[7] when with a mighty voice
2845,BOOK III.,"Thus Agamemnon, leader of the host.95"
2846,BOOK III.,"Argives! Be still—shoot not, ye sons of Greece!"
2847,BOOK III.,Hector bespeaks attention. Hear the Chief!
2848,BOOK III.,"He said, at once the Grecians ceased to shoot,"
2849,BOOK III.,And all sat silent. Hector then began.
2850,BOOK III.,"Hear me, ye Trojans, and ye Greeks mail-arm’d,100"
2851,BOOK III.,While I shall publish in your ears the words
2852,BOOK III.,"Of Alexander, author of our strife."
2853,BOOK III.,"Trojans, he bids, and Grecians on the field"
2854,BOOK III.,"Their arms dispose; while he, the hosts between,"
2855,BOOK III.,With warlike Menelaus shall in fight105
2856,BOOK III.,"Contend for Helen, and for all her wealth."
2857,BOOK III.,"Who strongest proves, and conquers, he, of her"
2858,BOOK III.,"And hers possess’d, shall bear them safe away,"
2859,BOOK III.,And oaths of amity shall bind the rest.
2860,BOOK III.,"He ceased, and all deep silence held, amazed;110"
2861,BOOK III.,When valiant Menelaus thus began.
2862,BOOK III.,"Hear now me also, on whose aching heart"
2863,BOOK III.,These woes have heaviest fallen. At last I hope
2864,BOOK III.,"Decision near, Trojans and Greeks between,"
2865,BOOK III.,"For ye have suffer’d in my quarrel much,115"
2866,BOOK III.,"And much by Paris, author of the war."
2867,BOOK III.,"Die he who must, and peace be to the rest."
2868,BOOK III.,"But ye shall hither bring two lambs, one white,"
2869,BOOK III.,"The other black;[8] this to the Earth devote,"
2870,BOOK III.,That to the Sun. We shall ourselves supply120
2871,BOOK III.,"A third for Jove. Then bring ye Priam forth,"
2872,BOOK III.,"Himself to swear the covenant, (for his sons"
2873,BOOK III.,Are faithless) lest the oath of Jove be scorn’d.
2874,BOOK III.,Young men are ever of unstable mind;
2875,BOOK III.,"But when an elder interferes, he views125"
2876,BOOK III.,"Future and past together, and insures"
2877,BOOK III.,"The compact, to both parties, uninfringed."
2878,BOOK III.,So Menelaus spake; and in all hearts
2879,BOOK III.,Awaken’d joyful hope that there should end
2880,BOOK III.,"War’s long calamities. Alighted each,130"
2881,BOOK III.,And drew his steeds into the lines. The field
2882,BOOK III.,"Glitter’d with arms put off, and side by side,"
2883,BOOK III.,"Ranged orderly, while the interrupted war"
2884,BOOK III.,"Stood front to front, small interval between."
2885,BOOK III.,Then Hector to the city sent in haste135
2886,BOOK III.,"Two heralds for the lambs, and to invite"
2887,BOOK III.,"Priam; while Agamemnon, royal Chief,"
2888,BOOK III.,Talthybius to the Grecian fleet dismiss’d
2889,BOOK III.,For a third lamb to Jove; nor he the voice
2890,BOOK III.,Of noble Agamemnon disobey’d.140
2891,BOOK III.,"Iris, ambassadress of heaven, the while,"
2892,BOOK III.,"To Helen came. Laödice she seem’d,"
2893,BOOK III.,Loveliest of all the daughters of the house
2894,BOOK III.,"Of Priam, wedded to Antenor’s son,"
2895,BOOK III.,"King Helicäon. Her she found within,145"
2896,BOOK III.,"An ample web magnificent she wove,[9]"
2897,BOOK III.,Inwrought with numerous conflicts for her sake
2898,BOOK III.,Beneath the hands of Mars endured by Greeks
2899,BOOK III.,"Mail-arm’d, and Trojans of equestrian fame."
2900,BOOK III.,"Swift Iris, at her side, her thus address’d.150"
2901,BOOK III.,"Haste, dearest nymph! a wondrous sight behold!"
2902,BOOK III.,"Greeks brazen-mail’d, and Trojans steed-renown’d."
2903,BOOK III.,So lately on the cruel work of Mars
2904,BOOK III.,"Intent and hot for mutual havoc, sit"
2905,BOOK III.,"Silent; the war hath paused, and on his shield155"
2906,BOOK III.,"Each leans, his long spear planted at his side."
2907,BOOK III.,"Paris and Menelaus, warrior bold,"
2908,BOOK III.,"With quivering lances shall contend for thee,"
2909,BOOK III.,And thou art his who conquers; his for ever.
2910,BOOK III.,"So saying, the Goddess into Helen’s soul160"
2911,BOOK III.,Sweetest desire infused to see again
2912,BOOK III.,"Her former Lord, her parents, and her home."
2913,BOOK III.,At once o’ermantled with her snowy veil
2914,BOOK III.,"She started forth, and as she went let fall"
2915,BOOK III.,A tender tear; not unaccompanied165
2916,BOOK III.,"She went, but by two maidens of her train"
2917,BOOK III.,"Attended, Æthra, Pittheus’ daughter fair,"
2918,BOOK III.,And soft-eyed Clymene. Their hasty steps
2919,BOOK III.,Convey’d them quickly to the Scæan gate.
2920,BOOK III.,"There Priam, Panthous, Clytius, Lampus sat,170"
2921,BOOK III.,"Thymoetes, Hicetaon, branch of Mars,"
2922,BOOK III.,"Antenor and Ucalegon the wise,"
2923,BOOK III.,"All, elders of the people; warriors erst,"
2924,BOOK III.,"But idle now through age, yet of a voice"
2925,BOOK III.,Still indefatigable as the fly’s[10]175
2926,BOOK III.,Which perch’d among the boughs sends forth at noon
2927,BOOK III.,Through all the grove his slender ditty sweet.
2928,BOOK III.,"Such sat those Trojan leaders on the tower,"
2929,BOOK III.,"Who, soon as Helen on the steps they saw,"
2930,BOOK III.,"In accents quick, but whisper’d, thus remark’d.180"
2931,BOOK III.,"Trojans and Grecians wage, with fair excuse,"
2932,BOOK III.,"Long war for so much beauty.[11] Oh, how like"
2933,BOOK III.,In feature to the Goddesses above!
2934,BOOK III.,"Pernicious loveliness! Ah, hence away,"
2935,BOOK III.,"Resistless as thou art and all divine,185"
2936,BOOK III.,"Nor leave a curse to us, and to our sons."
2937,BOOK III.,So they among themselves; but Priam call’d
2938,BOOK III.,Fair Helen to his side.[12] My daughter dear!
2939,BOOK III.,"Come, sit beside me. Thou shalt hence discern"
2940,BOOK III.,"Thy former Lord, thy kindred and thy friends.190"
2941,BOOK III.,"I charge no blame on thee. The Gods have caused,"
2942,BOOK III.,"Not thou, this lamentable war to Troy.[13]"
2943,BOOK III.,Name to me yon Achaian Chief for bulk
2944,BOOK III.,"Conspicuous, and for port. Taller indeed"
2945,BOOK III.,I may perceive than he; but with these eyes195
2946,BOOK III.,"Saw never yet such dignity, and grace."
2947,BOOK III.,Declare his name. Some royal Chief he seems.
2948,BOOK III.,"To whom thus Helen, loveliest of her sex,"
2949,BOOK III.,My other Sire! by me for ever held
2950,BOOK III.,"In reverence, and with filial fear beloved!200"
2951,BOOK III.,"Oh that some cruel death had been my choice,"
2952,BOOK III.,"Rather than to abandon, as I did,"
2953,BOOK III.,"All joys domestic, matrimonial bliss,"
2954,BOOK III.,"Brethren, dear daughter, and companions dear,"
2955,BOOK III.,A wanderer with thy son. Yet I alas!205
2956,BOOK III.,"Died not, and therefore now, live but to weep."
2957,BOOK III.,But I resolve thee. Thou behold’st the son
2958,BOOK III.,"Of Atreus, Agamemnon, mighty king,"
2959,BOOK III.,"In arms heroic, gracious in the throne,"
2960,BOOK III.,"And, (though it shame me now to call him such,)210"
2961,BOOK III.,By nuptial ties a brother once to me.
2962,BOOK III.,"Then him the ancient King-admiring, said."
2963,BOOK III.,"Oh blest Atrides, happy was thy birth,"
2964,BOOK III.,"And thy lot glorious, whom this gallant host"
2965,BOOK III.,"So numerous, of the sons of Greece obey!215"
2966,BOOK III.,"To vine-famed Phrygia, in my days of youth,"
2967,BOOK III.,"I journey’d; many Phrygians there I saw,"
2968,BOOK III.,"Brave horsemen, and expert; they were the powers"
2969,BOOK III.,"Of Otreus and of Mygdon, godlike Chief,"
2970,BOOK III.,And on the banks of Sangar’s stream encamp’d.220
2971,BOOK III.,"I march’d among them, chosen in that war"
2972,BOOK III.,"Ally of Phrygia, and it was her day"
2973,BOOK III.,"Of conflict with the man-defying race,"
2974,BOOK III.,The Amazons; yet multitudes like these
2975,BOOK III.,"Thy bright-eyed Greeks, I saw not even there.225"
2976,BOOK III.,The venerable King observing next
2977,BOOK III.,"Ulysses, thus inquired. My child, declare"
2978,BOOK III.,Him also. Shorter by the head he seems
2979,BOOK III.,"Than Agamemnon, Atreus’ mighty son,"
2980,BOOK III.,"But shoulder’d broader, and of ampler chest;230"
2981,BOOK III.,"He hath disposed his armor on the plain,"
2982,BOOK III.,"But like a ram, himself the warrior ranks"
2983,BOOK III.,Ranges majestic; like a ram full-fleeced
2984,BOOK III.,By numerous sheep encompass’d snowy-white.
2985,BOOK III.,To whom Jove’s daughter Helen thus replied.235
2986,BOOK III.,"In him the son of old Laërtes know,"
2987,BOOK III.,"Ulysses; born in Ithaca the rude,"
2988,BOOK III.,"But of a piercing wit, and deeply wise."
2989,BOOK III.,"Then answer thus, Antenor sage return’d."
2990,BOOK III.,Princess thou hast described him: hither once240
2991,BOOK III.,"The noble Ithacan, on thy behalf"
2992,BOOK III.,"Ambassador with Menelaus, came:"
2993,BOOK III.,"Beneath my roof, with hospitable fare"
2994,BOOK III.,Friendly I entertained them. Seeing then
2995,BOOK III.,"Occasion opportune, I closely mark’d245"
2996,BOOK III.,"The genius and the talents of the Chiefs,"
2997,BOOK III.,And this I noted well; that when they stood
2998,BOOK III.,"Amid the assembled counsellors of Troy,"
2999,BOOK III.,"Then Menelaus his advantage show’d,"
3000,BOOK III.,Who by the shoulders overtopp’d his friend.250
3001,BOOK III.,"But when both sat, Ulysses in his air"
3002,BOOK III.,Had more of state and dignity than he.
3003,BOOK III.,In the delivery of a speech address’d
3004,BOOK III.,"To the full senate, Menelaus used"
3005,BOOK III.,"Few words, but to the matter, fitly ranged,255"
3006,BOOK III.,And with much sweetness utter’d; for in loose
3007,BOOK III.,And idle play of ostentatious terms
3008,BOOK III.,"He dealt not, thhugh he were the younger man."
3009,BOOK III.,But when the wise Ulysses from his seat
3010,BOOK III.,"Had once arisen, he would his downcast eyes260"
3011,BOOK III.,"So rivet on the earth, and with a hand"
3012,BOOK III.,"That seem’d untutor’d in its use, so hold"
3013,BOOK III.,"His sceptre, swaying it to neither side,"
3014,BOOK III.,"That hadst thou seen him, thou hadst thought him, sure,"
3015,BOOK III.,"Some chafed and angry idiot, passion-fixt.265"
3016,BOOK III.,"Yet, when at length, the clear and mellow base"
3017,BOOK III.,"Of his deep voice brake forth, and he let fall"
3018,BOOK III.,"His chosen words like flakes of feather’d snow,"
3019,BOOK III.,"None then might match Ulysses; leisure, then,"
3020,BOOK III.,Found none to wonder at his noble form.270
3021,BOOK III.,The third of whom the venerable king
3022,BOOK III.,"Inquired, was Ajax.—Yon Achaian tall,"
3023,BOOK III.,"Whose head and shoulders tower above the rest,"
3024,BOOK III.,And of such bulk prodigious—who is he?
3025,BOOK III.,"Him answer’d Helen, loveliest of her sex.275"
3026,BOOK III.,A bulwark of the Greeks. In him thou seest
3027,BOOK III.,Gigantic Ajax. Opposite appear
3028,BOOK III.,"The Cretans, and among the Chiefs of Crete"
3029,BOOK III.,"stands, like a God, Idomeneus. Him oft"
3030,BOOK III.,"From Crete arrived, was Menelaüs wont280"
3031,BOOK III.,"To entertain; and others now I see,"
3032,BOOK III.,"Achaians, whom I could recall to mind,"
3033,BOOK III.,And give to each his name; but two brave youths
3034,BOOK III.,I yet discern not; for equestrian skill
3035,BOOK III.,"One famed, and one a boxer never foiled;285"
3036,BOOK III.,My brothers; born of Leda; sons of Jove;
3037,BOOK III.,Castor and Pollux. Either they abide
3038,BOOK III.,"In lovely Sparta still, or if they came,"
3039,BOOK III.,"Decline the fight, by my disgrace abash’d"
3040,BOOK III.,And the reproaches which have fallen on me.[14]290
3041,BOOK III.,She said; but they already slept inhumed
3042,BOOK III.,"In Lacedemon, in their native soil."
3043,BOOK III.,"And now the heralds, through the streets of Troy"
3044,BOOK III.,"Charged with the lambs, and with a goat-skin filled"
3045,BOOK III.,With heart-exhilarating wine prepared295
3046,BOOK III.,"For that divine solemnity, return’d."
3047,BOOK III.,Idæus in his hand a beaker bore
3048,BOOK III.,"Resplendent, with its fellow cups of gold,"
3049,BOOK III.,And thus he summon’d ancient Priam forth.
3050,BOOK III.,"Son of Laömedon, arise. The Chiefs300"
3051,BOOK III.,"Call thee, the Chiefs of Ilium and of Greece."
3052,BOOK III.,"Descend into the plain. We strike a truce,"
3053,BOOK III.,And need thine oath to bind it. Paris fights
3054,BOOK III.,With warlike Menelaüs for his spouse;
3055,BOOK III.,Their spears decide the strife. The conqueror wins305
3056,BOOK III.,"Helen and all her treasures. We, thenceforth,"
3057,BOOK III.,(Peace sworn and amity) shall dwell secure
3058,BOOK III.,"In Troy, while they to Argos shall return"
3059,BOOK III.,And to Achaia praised for women fair.
3060,BOOK III.,"He spake, and Priam, shuddering, bade his train310"
3061,BOOK III.,Prepare his steeds; they sedulous obey’d.
3062,BOOK III.,"First, Priam mounting, backward stretch’d the reins;"
3063,BOOK III.,"Antenor, next, beside him sat, and through"
3064,BOOK III.,The Scæan gate they drove into the plain.
3065,BOOK III.,Arriving at the hosts of Greece and Troy315
3066,BOOK III.,"They left the chariot, and proceeded both"
3067,BOOK III.,Into the interval between the hosts.
3068,BOOK III.,"Then uprose Agamemnon, and uprose"
3069,BOOK III.,"All-wise Ulysses. Next, the heralds came"
3070,BOOK III.,"Conspicuous forward, expediting each320"
3071,BOOK III.,The ceremonial; they the beaker fill’d
3072,BOOK III.,"With wine, and to the hands of all the kings"
3073,BOOK III.,Minister’d water. Agamemnon then
3074,BOOK III.,Drawing his dagger which he ever bore
3075,BOOK III.,"Appendant to his heavy falchion’s sheath,325"
3076,BOOK III.,"Cut off the forelocks of the lambs,[15] of which"
3077,BOOK III.,The heralds gave to every Grecian Chief
3078,BOOK III.,"A portion, and to all the Chiefs of Troy."
3079,BOOK III.,"Then Agamemnon raised his hands, and pray’d."
3080,BOOK III.,"Jove, Father, who from Ida stretchest forth330"
3081,BOOK III.,"Thine arm omnipotent, o’erruling all,"
3082,BOOK III.,"And thou, all-seeing and all-hearing Sun,"
3083,BOOK III.,"Ye Rivers, and thou conscious Earth, and ye"
3084,BOOK III.,Who under earth on human kind avenge
3085,BOOK III.,"Severe, the guilt of violated oaths,335"
3086,BOOK III.,"Hear ye, and ratify what now we swear!"
3087,BOOK III.,"Should Paris slay the hero amber-hair’d,"
3088,BOOK III.,"My brother Menelaüs, Helen’s wealth"
3089,BOOK III.,"And Helen’s self are his, and all our host"
3090,BOOK III.,Shall home return to Greece; but should it chance340
3091,BOOK III.,"That Paris fall by Menelaüs’ hand,"
3092,BOOK III.,"Then Troy shall render back what she detains,"
3093,BOOK III.,"With such amercement as is meet, a sum"
3094,BOOK III.,To be remember’d in all future times.
3095,BOOK III.,Which penalty should Priam and his sons345
3096,BOOK III.,"Not pay, though Paris fall, then here in arms"
3097,BOOK III.,I will contend for payment of the mulct
3098,BOOK III.,"My due, till, satisfied, I close the war."
3099,BOOK III.,"He said, and with his ruthless steel the lambs"
3100,BOOK III.,"Stretch’d panting all, but soon they ceased to pant,350"
3101,BOOK III.,For mortal was the stroke.[16] Then drawing forth
3102,BOOK III.,"Wine from the beaker, they with brimming cups"
3103,BOOK III.,"Hail’d the immortal Gods, and pray’d again,"
3104,BOOK III.,And many a Grecian thus and Trojan spake.
3105,BOOK III.,"All-glorious Jove, and ye the powers of heaven,355"
3106,BOOK III.,"Whoso shall violate this contract first,"
3107,BOOK III.,So be the brains of them and of their sons
3108,BOOK III.,"Pour’d out, as we this wine pour on the earth,"
3109,BOOK III.,And may their wives bring forth to other men!
3110,BOOK III.,So they: but them Jove heard not. Then arose360
3111,BOOK III.,"Priam, the son of Dardanus, and said,"
3112,BOOK III.,"Hear me, ye Trojans and ye Greeks well-arm’d."
3113,BOOK III.,"Hence back to wind-swept Ilium I return,"
3114,BOOK III.,"Unable to sustain the sight, my son"
3115,BOOK III.,With warlike Menelaüs match’d in arms.365
3116,BOOK III.,"Jove knows, and the immortal Gods, to whom"
3117,BOOK III.,"Of both, this day is preordain’d the last."
3118,BOOK III.,"So spake the godlike monarch, and disposed"
3119,BOOK III.,Within the royal chariot all the lambs;
3120,BOOK III.,"Then, mounting, check’d the reins; Antenor next370"
3121,BOOK III.,"Ascended, and to Ilium both return’d."
3122,BOOK III.,"First, Hector and Ulysses, noble Chief,"
3123,BOOK III.,Measured the ground; then taking lots for proof
3124,BOOK III.,Who of the combatants should foremost hurl
3125,BOOK III.,"His spear, they shook them in a brazen casque;375"
3126,BOOK III.,"Meantime the people raised their hands on high,"
3127,BOOK III.,And many a Grecian thus and Trojan prayed.
3128,BOOK III.,"Jove, Father, who on Ida seated, seest"
3129,BOOK III.,"And rulest all below, glorious in power!"
3130,BOOK III.,"Of these two champions, to the drear abodes380"
3131,BOOK III.,Of Ades him appoint who furnish’d first
3132,BOOK III.,"The cause of strife between them, and let peace"
3133,BOOK III.,"Oath-bound, and amity unite the rest!"
3134,BOOK III.,"So spake the hosts; then Hector shook the lots,"
3135,BOOK III.,"Majestic Chief, turning his face aside.385"
3136,BOOK III.,Forth sprang the lot of Paris. They in ranks
3137,BOOK III.,"Sat all, where stood the fiery steeds of each,"
3138,BOOK III.,And where his radiant arms lay on the field.
3139,BOOK III.,Illustrious Alexander his bright arms
3140,BOOK III.,"Put on, fair Helen’s paramour. [17]He clasp’d390"
3141,BOOK III.,His polish’d greaves with silver studs secured;
3142,BOOK III.,"His brother’s corselet to his breast he bound,"
3143,BOOK III.,"Lycaon’s, apt to his own shape and size,"
3144,BOOK III.,"And slung athwart his shoulders, bright emboss’d,"
3145,BOOK III.,His brazen sword; his massy buckler broad395
3146,BOOK III.,"He took, and to his graceful head his casque"
3147,BOOK III.,"Adjusted elegant, which, as he moved,"
3148,BOOK III.,"Its bushy crest waved dreadful; last he seized,"
3149,BOOK III.,"Well fitted to his gripe, his ponderous spear."
3150,BOOK III.,Meantime the hero Menelaüs made400
3151,BOOK III.,"Like preparation, and his arms put on."
3152,BOOK III.,"When thus, from all the multitude apart,"
3153,BOOK III.,"Both combatants had arm’d, with eyes that flash’d"
3154,BOOK III.,"Defiance, to the middle space they strode,"
3155,BOOK III.,Trojans and Greeks between. Astonishment405
3156,BOOK III.,Seized all beholders. On the measured ground
3157,BOOK III.,"Full near they stood, each brandishing on high"
3158,BOOK III.,"His massy spear, and each was fiery wroth."
3159,BOOK III.,"First, Alexander his long-shadow’d spear"
3160,BOOK III.,"Sent forth, and on his smooth shield’s surface struck410"
3161,BOOK III.,"The son of Atreus, but the brazen guard"
3162,BOOK III.,"Pierced not, for at the disk, with blunted point"
3163,BOOK III.,"Reflex, his ineffectual weapon stay’d."
3164,BOOK III.,Then Menelaüs to the fight advanced
3165,BOOK III.,"Impetuous, after prayer offer’d to Jove.[18]415"
3166,BOOK III.,King over all! now grant me to avenge
3167,BOOK III.,My wrongs on Alexander; now subdue
3168,BOOK III.,The aggressor under me; that men unborn
3169,BOOK III.,"May shudder at the thought of faith abused,"
3170,BOOK III.,And hospitality with rape repaid.420
3171,BOOK III.,"He said, and brandishing his massy spear,"
3172,BOOK III.,Dismiss’d it. Through the burnish’d buckler broad
3173,BOOK III.,"Of Priam’s son the stormy weapon flew,"
3174,BOOK III.,"Transpierced his costly hauberk, and the vest"
3175,BOOK III.,Ripp’d on his flank; but with a sideward bend425
3176,BOOK III.,"He baffled it, and baulk’d the dreadful death."
3177,BOOK III.,"Then Menelaüs drawing his bright blade,"
3178,BOOK III.,"Swung it aloft, and on the hairy crest"
3179,BOOK III.,Smote him; but shiver’d into fragments small
3180,BOOK III.,The falchion at the stroke fell from his hand.430
3181,BOOK III.,Vexation fill’d him; to the spacious heavens
3182,BOOK III.,"He look’d, and with a voice of wo exclaim’d—"
3183,BOOK III.,Jupiter! of all powers by man adored
3184,BOOK III.,To me most adverse! Confident I hoped
3185,BOOK III.,"Revenge for Paris’ treason, but my sword435"
3186,BOOK III.,"Is shivered, and I sped my spear in vain."
3187,BOOK III.,"So saying, he sprang on him, and his long crest"
3188,BOOK III.,"Seized fast; then, turning, drew him by that hold"
3189,BOOK III.,Toward the Grecian host. The broider’d band
3190,BOOK III.,"That underbraced his helmet at the chin,440"
3191,BOOK III.,"Strain’d to his smooth neck with a ceaseless force,"
3192,BOOK III.,Chok’d him; and now had Menelaus won
3193,BOOK III.,"Deathless renown, dragging him off the field,"
3194,BOOK III.,"But Venus, foam-sprung Goddess, feeling quick"
3195,BOOK III.,"His peril imminent, snapp’d short the brace445"
3196,BOOK III.,"Though stubborn, by a slaughter’d[19] ox supplied,"
3197,BOOK III.,And the void helmet follow’d as he pull’d.
3198,BOOK III.,"That prize the Hero, whirling it aloft,"
3199,BOOK III.,"Threw to his Greeks, who caught it and secured,"
3200,BOOK III.,Then with vindictive strides he rush’d again450
3201,BOOK III.,"On Paris, spear in hand; but him involved"
3202,BOOK III.,In mist opaque Venus with ease divine
3203,BOOK III.,"Snatch’d thence, and in his chamber placed him, fill’d"
3204,BOOK III.,"With scents odorous, spirit-soothing sweets."
3205,BOOK III.,"Nor stay’d the Goddess, but at once in quest455"
3206,BOOK III.,Of Helen went; her on a lofty tower
3207,BOOK III.,"She found, where many a damsel stood of Troy,"
3208,BOOK III.,And twitch’d her fragrant robe. In form she seem’d
3209,BOOK III.,"An ancient matron, who, while Helen dwelt"
3210,BOOK III.,"In Lacedæmon, her unsullied wool460"
3211,BOOK III.,"Dress’d for her, faithfullest of all her train."
3212,BOOK III.,Like her disguised the Goddess thus began.
3213,BOOK III.,"Haste—Paris calls thee—on his sculptured couch,"
3214,BOOK III.,(Sparkling alike his looks and his attire)
3215,BOOK III.,He waits thy wish’d return. Thou wouldst not dream465
3216,BOOK III.,That he had fought; he rather seems prepared
3217,BOOK III.,"For dance, or after dance, for soft repose."
3218,BOOK III.,"So saying, she tumult raised in Helen’s mind."
3219,BOOK III.,"Yet soon as by her symmetry of neck,"
3220,BOOK III.,By her love-kindling breasts and luminous eyes470
3221,BOOK III.,"She knew the Goddess, her she thus bespake."
3222,BOOK III.,"Ah whence, deceitful deity! thy wish"
3223,BOOK III.,"Now to ensnare me? Wouldst thou lure me, say,"
3224,BOOK III.,To some fair city of Mæonian name
3225,BOOK III.,"Or Phrygian, more remote from Sparta still?475"
3226,BOOK III.,Hast thou some human favorite also there?
3227,BOOK III.,Is it because Atrides hath prevailed
3228,BOOK III.,"To vanquish Paris, and would bear me home"
3229,BOOK III.,"Unworthy as I am, that thou attempt’st"
3230,BOOK III.,Again to cheat me? Go thyself—sit thou480
3231,BOOK III.,Beside him—for his sake renounce the skies;
3232,BOOK III.,"Watch him, weep for him; till at length his wife"
3233,BOOK III.,"He deign to make thee, or perchance his slave."
3234,BOOK III.,I go not (now to go were shame indeed)
3235,BOOK III.,To dress his couch; nor will I be the jest485
3236,BOOK III.,Of all my sex in Ilium. Oh! my griefs
3237,BOOK III.,"Are infinite, and more than I can bear."
3238,BOOK III.,"To whom, the foam-sprung Goddess, thus incensed."
3239,BOOK III.,Ah wretch! provoke not me; lest in my wrath
3240,BOOK III.,"Abandoning thee, I not hate thee less490"
3241,BOOK III.,"Than now I fondly love thee, and beget"
3242,BOOK III.,"Such detestation of thee in all hearts,"
3243,BOOK III.,"Grecian and Trojan, that thou die abhorr’d."
3244,BOOK III.,"The Goddess ceased. Jove’s daughter, Helen, fear’d,"
3245,BOOK III.,"And, in her lucid veil close wrapt around,495"
3246,BOOK III.,"Silent retired, of all those Trojan dames"
3247,BOOK III.,"Unseen, and Venus led, herself, the way."
3248,BOOK III.,Soon then as Alexander’s fair abode
3249,BOOK III.,"They reach’d, her maidens quick their tasks resumed,"
3250,BOOK III.,And she to her own chamber lofty-roof’d500
3251,BOOK III.,"Ascended, loveliest of her sex. A seat"
3252,BOOK III.,"For Helen, daughter of Jove Ægis-arm’d,"
3253,BOOK III.,"To Paris opposite, the Queen of smiles"
3254,BOOK III.,Herself disposed; but with averted eyes
3255,BOOK III.,"She sat before him, and him keen reproach’d.505"
3256,BOOK III.,Thou hast escaped.—Ah would that thou hadst died
3257,BOOK III.,"By that heroic arm, mine husband’s erst!"
3258,BOOK III.,Thou once didst vaunt thee in address and strength

3260,BOOK III.,The warlike Menelaüs forth in fight.510
3261,BOOK III.,But hold. The hero of the amber locks
3262,BOOK III.,"Provoke no more so rashly, lest the point"
3263,BOOK III.,Of his victorious spear soon stretch thee dead.
3264,BOOK III.,"She ended, to whom Paris thus replied."

3266,BOOK III.,"Me, Menelaüs, by Minerva’s aid,"
3267,BOOK III.,"Hath vanquish’d now, who may hereafter, him."
3268,BOOK III.,We also have our Gods. But let us love.
3269,BOOK III.,For never since the day when thee I bore
3270,BOOK III.,From pleasant Lacedæmon o’er the waves520
3271,BOOK III.,"To Cranäe’s fair isle, and first enjoy’d"
3272,BOOK III.,"Thy beauty, loved I as I love thee now,"

3275,BOOK III.,"He spake, and sought his bed, whom follow’d soon"

3277,BOOK III.,But Menelaüs like a lion ranged
3278,BOOK III.,"The multitude, inquiring far and near"
3279,BOOK III.,For Paris lost. Yet neither Trojan him
3280,BOOK III.,"Nor friend of Troy could show, whom, else, through love"
3281,BOOK III.,"None had conceal’d, for him as death itself530"
3282,BOOK III.,"All hated, but his going none had seen."
3283,BOOK III.,Amidst them all then spake the King of men.
3284,BOOK III.,"Trojans, and Dardans, and allies of Troy!"
3285,BOOK III.,"The warlike Menelaüs hath prevailed,"
3286,BOOK III.,As is most plain. Now therefore bring ye forth535
3287,BOOK III.,"Helen with all her treasures, also bring"

3348,BOOK IV.,Do it. But small thy praise shall be in heaven.
3349,BOOK IV.,Then her the Thunderer answer’d sore displeased.35
3350,BOOK IV.,Ah shameless! how have Priam and his sons

3394,BOOK IV.,By some fresh insult on the exulting Greeks.80
3395,BOOK IV.,"So Juno; nor the sire of all refused,"

3397,BOOK IV.,Begone; swift fly to yonder field; incite
3398,BOOK IV.,The Trojans first to violate their oath

3400,BOOK IV.,"The Goddess heard, and what she wish’d, enjoin’d,"

3404,BOOK IV.,"And breaking into stars, an omen sent90"
3405,BOOK IV.,"To mariners, or to some numerous host."
3406,BOOK IV.,"Such Pallas seem’d, and swift descending, dropp’d"
3407,BOOK IV.,Full in the midst between them. They with awe
3408,BOOK IV.,"That sign portentous and with wonder view’d,"
3409,BOOK IV.,"Achaians both and Trojans, and his next95"
3410,BOOK IV.,The soldier thus bespake. Now either war
3411,BOOK IV.,"And dire hostility again shall flame,"
3412,BOOK IV.,Or Jove now gives us peace. Both are from Jove.
3413,BOOK IV.,So spake the soldiery; but she the form
3414,BOOK IV.,"Taking of brave Laodocus, the son100"
3415,BOOK IV.,"Of old Antenor, throughout all the ranks"
3416,BOOK IV.,Sought godlike Pandarus.[4] Ere long she found

3418,BOOK IV.,"Standing encompass’d by his dauntless troops,"
3419,BOOK IV.,"Broad-shielded warriors, from Æsepus’ stream105"
3420,BOOK IV.,"His followers; to his side the Goddess came,"
3421,BOOK IV.,And in wing’d accents ardent him bespake.
3422,BOOK IV.,"Brave offspring of Lycaon, is there hope"
3423,BOOK IV.,That thou wilt hear my counsel? darest thou slip
3424,BOOK IV.,A shaft at Menelaus? much renown110
3425,BOOK IV.,"Thou shalt and thanks from all the Trojans win,"
3426,BOOK IV.,"But most of all, from Paris, prince of Troy."
3427,BOOK IV.,From him illustrious gifts thou shalt receive
3428,BOOK IV.,"Doubtless, when Menelaus he shall see"
3429,BOOK IV.,The martial son of Atreus by a shaft115
3430,BOOK IV.,"Subdued of thine, placed on his funeral pile."
3431,BOOK IV.,"Come. Shoot at Menelaus, glorious Chief!"
3432,BOOK IV.,But vow to Lycian Phœbus bow-renown’d
3433,BOOK IV.,"A hecatomb, all firstlings of the flock,"
3434,BOOK IV.,To fair Zeleia’s[5] walls once safe restored.120
3435,BOOK IV.,"So Pallas spake, to whom infatuate he"
3436,BOOK IV.,"Listening, uncased at once his polished bow.[6]"
3437,BOOK IV.,"That bow, the laden brows of a wild goat"
3438,BOOK IV.,Salacious had supplied; him on a day
3439,BOOK IV.,"Forth-issuing from his cave, in ambush placed125"
3440,BOOK IV.,He wounded with an arrow to his breast
3441,BOOK IV.,"Dispatch’d, and on the rock supine he fell."
3442,BOOK IV.,"Each horn had from his head tall growth attain’d,"
3443,BOOK IV.,Full sixteen palms; them shaven smooth the smith
3444,BOOK IV.,"Had aptly join’d, and tipt their points with gold.130"
3445,BOOK IV.,"That bow he strung, then, stooping, planted firm"
3446,BOOK IV.,"The nether horn, his comrades bold the while"
3447,BOOK IV.,"Screening him close with shields, lest ere the prince"
3448,BOOK IV.,"Were stricken, Menelaus brave in arms,"
3449,BOOK IV.,The Greeks with fierce assault should interpose.135
3450,BOOK IV.,He raised his quiver’s lid; he chose a dart
3451,BOOK IV.,"Unflown, full-fledged, and barb’d with pangs of death."
3452,BOOK IV.,"He lodged in haste the arrow on the string,"
3453,BOOK IV.,And vow’d to Lycian Phœbus bow-renown’d
3454,BOOK IV.,"A hecatomb, all firstlings of the flock,140"
3455,BOOK IV.,To fair Zeleia’s walls once safe restored.
3456,BOOK IV.,Compressing next nerve and notch’d arrow-head
3457,BOOK IV.,"He drew back both together, to his pap"
3458,BOOK IV.,"Drew home the nerve, the barb home to his bow,"
3459,BOOK IV.,"And when the horn was curved to a wide arch,145"
3460,BOOK IV.,"He twang’d it. Whizz’d the bowstring, and the reed"
3461,BOOK IV.,"Leap’d off, impatient for the distant throng."
3462,BOOK IV.,"Thee, Menelaus, then the blessed Gods"
3463,BOOK IV.,"Forgat not; Pallas huntress of the spoil,"
3464,BOOK IV.,"Thy guardian then, baffled the cruel dart.150"
3465,BOOK IV.,Far as a mother wafts the fly aside[7]
3466,BOOK IV.,"That haunts her slumbering babe, so far she drove"
3467,BOOK IV.,"Its course aslant, directing it herself"
3468,BOOK IV.,Against the golden clasps that join’d his belt;
3469,BOOK IV.,For there the doubled hauberk interposed.155
3470,BOOK IV.,The bitter arrow plunged into his belt.
3471,BOOK IV.,"It pierced his broider’d belt, stood fixt within"
3472,BOOK IV.,"His twisted hauberk, nor the interior quilt,"
3473,BOOK IV.,Though penetrable least to arrow-points
3474,BOOK IV.,"And his best guard, withheld it, but it pass’d160"
3475,BOOK IV.,"That also, and the Hero’s skin inscribed."
3476,BOOK IV.,Quick flowed a sable current from the wound.
3477,BOOK IV.,As when a Carian or Mæonian maid
3478,BOOK IV.,Impurples ivory ordain’d to grace
3479,BOOK IV.,"The cheek of martial steed; safe stored it lies,165"
3480,BOOK IV.,"By many a Chief desired, but proves at last"
3481,BOOK IV.,"The stately trapping of some prince,[8] the pride"
3482,BOOK IV.,"Of his high pamper’d steed, nor less his own;"
3483,BOOK IV.,"Such, Menelaus, seem’d thy shapely thighs,"

3486,BOOK IV.,"The blood fast trickling from the wound, nor less"

3488,BOOK IV.,But neck and barb observing from the flesh
3489,BOOK IV.,"Extant, he gather’d heart, and lived again.175"
3490,BOOK IV.,"The royal Agamemnon, sighing, grasp’d"
3491,BOOK IV.,"The hand of Menelaus, and while all"
3492,BOOK IV.,"Their followers sigh’d around them, thus began.[9]"
3493,BOOK IV.,
3494,BOOK IV.,"I swore thy death, my brother, when I swore"
3495,BOOK IV.,"This truce, and set thee forth in sight of Greeks180"
3496,BOOK IV.,"And Trojans, our sole champion; for the foe"
3497,BOOK IV.,"Hath trodden underfoot his sacred oath,"
3498,BOOK IV.,"And stained it with thy blood. But not in vain,"
3499,BOOK IV.,"The truce was ratified, the blood of lambs"
3500,BOOK IV.,"Poured forth, libation made, and right hands join’d185"
3501,BOOK IV.,In holy confidence. The wrath of Jove
3502,BOOK IV.,"May sleep, but will not always; they shall pay"
3503,BOOK IV.,Dear penalty; their own obnoxious heads
3504,BOOK IV.,"Shall be the mulct, their children and their wives."
3505,BOOK IV.,"For this I know, know surely; that a day190"
3506,BOOK IV.,"Shall come, when Ilium, when the warlike King"
3507,BOOK IV.,Of Ilium and his host shall perish all.
3508,BOOK IV.,"Saturnian Jove high-throned, dwelling in heaven,"
3509,BOOK IV.,"Resentful of this outrage, then shall shake"
3510,BOOK IV.,His storm-clad Ægis over them. He will;195
3511,BOOK IV.,I speak no fable. Time shall prove me true.
3512,BOOK IV.,"But, oh my Menelaus, dire distress"
3513,BOOK IV.,"Awaits me, if thy close of life be come,"
3514,BOOK IV.,And thou must die. Then ignominy foul
3515,BOOK IV.,Shall hunt me back to Argos long-desired;200
3516,BOOK IV.,"For then all here will recollect their home,"
3517,BOOK IV.,"And, hope abandoning, will Helen yield"
3518,BOOK IV.,"To be the boast of Priam, and of Troy."
3519,BOOK IV.,"So shall our toils be vain, and while thy bones"
3520,BOOK IV.,"Shall waste these clods beneath, Troy’s haughty sons205"
3521,BOOK IV.,The tomb of Menelaus glory-crown’d
3522,BOOK IV.,"Insulting barbarous, shall scoff at me."
3523,BOOK IV.,"So may Atrides, shall they say, perform"
3524,BOOK IV.,"His anger still as he performed it here,"
3525,BOOK IV.,"Whither he led an unsuccessful host,210"
3526,BOOK IV.,"Whence he hath sail’d again without the spoils,"
3527,BOOK IV.,And where he left his brother’s bones to rot.
3528,BOOK IV.,So shall the Trojan speak; then open earth
3529,BOOK IV.,"Her mouth, and hide me in her deepest gulfs!"
3530,BOOK IV.,"But him, the hero of the golden locks215"
3531,BOOK IV.,"Thus cheer’d. My brother, fear not, nor infect"
3532,BOOK IV.,With fear the Grecians; the sharp-pointed reed
3533,BOOK IV.,"Hath touch’d no vital part. The broider’d zone,"
3534,BOOK IV.,"The hauberk, and the tough interior quilt,"
3535,BOOK IV.,"Work of the armorer, its force repress’d.220"
3536,BOOK IV.,"Him answer’d Agamemnon, King of men."
3537,BOOK IV.,So be it brother! but the hand of one
3538,BOOK IV.,Skilful to heal shall visit and shall dress
3539,BOOK IV.,The wound with drugs of pain-assuaging power.
3540,BOOK IV.,"He ended, and his noble herald, next,225"
3541,BOOK IV.,"Bespake, Talthybius. Haste, call hither quick"
3542,BOOK IV.,"The son of Æsculapius, leech renown’d,"
3543,BOOK IV.,The prince Machaon. Bid him fly to attend
3544,BOOK IV.,The warlike Chieftain Menelaus; him
3545,BOOK IV.,"Some archer, either Lycian or of Troy,230"
3546,BOOK IV.,"A dexterous one, hath stricken with a shaft"
3547,BOOK IV.,"To his own glory, and to our distress."
3548,BOOK IV.,"He spake, nor him the herald disobey’d,"
3549,BOOK IV.,But through the Greeks bright-arm’d his course began
3550,BOOK IV.,The Hero seeking earnest on all sides235
3551,BOOK IV.,"Machaon. Him, ere long, he station’d saw"
3552,BOOK IV.,Amid the shielded-ranks of his brave band
3553,BOOK IV.,"From steed-famed Tricca drawn, and at his side"
3554,BOOK IV.,"With accents ardor-wing’d, him thus address’d."
3555,BOOK IV.,"Haste, Asclepiades! The King of men240"
3556,BOOK IV.,Calls thee. Delay not. Thou must visit quick
3557,BOOK IV.,"Brave Menelaus, Atreus’ son, for him"
3558,BOOK IV.,"Some archer, either Lycian or of Troy,"
3559,BOOK IV.,"A dexterous one, hath stricken with a shaft"
3560,BOOK IV.,"To his own glory, and to our distress.245"
3561,BOOK IV.,"So saying, he roused Machaon, who his course"
3562,BOOK IV.,Through the wide host began. Arriving soon
3563,BOOK IV.,"Where wounded Menelaus stood, while all"
3564,BOOK IV.,The bravest of Achaia’s host around
3565,BOOK IV.,"The godlike hero press’d, he strove at once250"
3566,BOOK IV.,To draw the arrow from his cincture forth.
3567,BOOK IV.,"But, drawing, bent the barbs. He therefore loosed"
3568,BOOK IV.,"His broider’d belt, his hauberk and his quilt,"
3569,BOOK IV.,"Work of the armorer, and laying bare"
3570,BOOK IV.,His body where the bitter shaft had plow’d255
3571,BOOK IV.,"His flesh, he suck’d the wound, then spread it o’er"
3572,BOOK IV.,"With drugs of balmy power, given on a time"
3573,BOOK IV.,For friendship’s sake by Chiron to his sire.
3574,BOOK IV.,While Menelaus thus the cares engross’d
3575,BOOK IV.,"Of all those Chiefs, the shielded powers of Troy260"
3576,BOOK IV.,"’Gan move toward them, and the Greeks again"
3577,BOOK IV.,"Put on their armor, mindful of the fight."
3578,BOOK IV.,Then hadst thou[10] not great Agamemnon seen
3579,BOOK IV.,"Slumbering, or trembling, or averse from war,"
3580,BOOK IV.,But ardent to begin his glorious task.265
3581,BOOK IV.,"His steeds, and his bright chariot brass-inlaid"
3582,BOOK IV.,"He left; the snorting steeds Eurymedon,"
3583,BOOK IV.,Offspring of Ptolemy Piraïdes
3584,BOOK IV.,Detain’d apart; for him he strict enjoin’d
3585,BOOK IV.,"Attendance near, lest weariness of limbs270"
3586,BOOK IV.,Should seize him marshalling his numerous host.
3587,BOOK IV.,"So forth he went, and through the files on foot"
3588,BOOK IV.,"Proceeding, where the warrior Greeks he saw"
3589,BOOK IV.,"Alert, he roused them by his words the more.[11]"
3590,BOOK IV.,Argives! abate no spark of all your fire.275
3591,BOOK IV.,Jove will not prosper traitors. Them who first
3592,BOOK IV.,"Transgress’d the truce the vultures shall devour,"
3593,BOOK IV.,But we (their city taken) shall their wives
3594,BOOK IV.,"Lead captive, and their children home to Greece."
3595,BOOK IV.,"So cheer’d he them. But whom he saw supine,280"
3596,BOOK IV.,"Or in the rugged work of war remiss,"
3597,BOOK IV.,In terms of anger them he stern rebuked.
3598,BOOK IV.,Oh Greeks! The shame of Argos! Arrow-doom’d!
3599,BOOK IV.,"Blush ye not? Wherefore stand ye thus aghast,"
3600,BOOK IV.,Like fawns which wearied after scouring wide285
3601,BOOK IV.,"The champain, gaze and pant, and can no more?"
3602,BOOK IV.,"Senseless like them ye stand, nor seek the fight."
3603,BOOK IV.,Is it your purpose patient here to wait
3604,BOOK IV.,Till Troy invade your vessels on the shore
3605,BOOK IV.,"Of the grey deep, that ye may trial make290"
3606,BOOK IV.,"Of Jove, if he will prove, himself, your shield?"
3607,BOOK IV.,"Thus, in discharge of his high office, pass’d"
3608,BOOK IV.,"Atrides through the ranks, and now arrived"
3609,BOOK IV.,"Where, hardy Chief! Idomeneus in front"
3610,BOOK IV.,"Of his bold Cretans stood, stout as a boar295"
3611,BOOK IV.,"The van he occupied, while in the rear"
3612,BOOK IV.,Meriones harangued the most remote.
3613,BOOK IV.,Them so prepared the King of men beheld

3625,BOOK IV.,"March. Seek the foe. Fight now as heretofore,310"

3628,BOOK IV.,Which I have promised will I well perform.
3629,BOOK IV.,"Go; animate the rest, Chief after Chief"
3630,BOOK IV.,"Of the Achaians, that the fight begin.315"
3631,BOOK IV.,"For Troy has scatter’d to the winds all faith,"
3632,BOOK IV.,All conscience; and for such her treachery foul
3633,BOOK IV.,Shall have large recompence of death and wo.
3634,BOOK IV.,"He said, whom Agamemnon at his heart"
3635,BOOK IV.,"Exulting, pass’d, and in his progress came320"
3636,BOOK IV.,Where stood each Ajax; them he found prepared
3637,BOOK IV.,With all their cloud of infantry behind.
3638,BOOK IV.,As when the goat-herd on some rocky point
3639,BOOK IV.,"Advanced, a cloud sees wafted o’er the deep"
3640,BOOK IV.,"By western gales, and rolling slow along,325"
3641,BOOK IV.,"To him, who stands remote, pitch-black it seems,"
3642,BOOK IV.,And comes with tempest charged; he at the sight
3643,BOOK IV.,"Shuddering, his flock compels into a cave;"
3644,BOOK IV.,"So moved the gloomy phalanx, rough with spears,"
3645,BOOK IV.,"And dense with shields of youthful warriors bold,330"
3646,BOOK IV.,Close-following either Ajax to the fight.
3647,BOOK IV.,"Them also, pleased, the King of men beheld,"
3648,BOOK IV.,And in wing’d accents hail’d them as he pass’d.
3649,BOOK IV.,Brave leaders of the mail-clad host of Greece!
3650,BOOK IV.,I move not you to duty; ye yourselves335
3651,BOOK IV.,"Move others, and no lesson need from me."
3652,BOOK IV.,"Jove, Pallas, and Apollo! were but all"
3653,BOOK IV.,"Courageous as yourselves, soon Priam’s towers"
3654,BOOK IV.,"Should totter, and his Ilium storm’d and sack’d"
3655,BOOK IV.,"By our victorious bands, stoop to the dust.340"
3656,BOOK IV.,"He ceased, and still proceeding, next arrived"
3657,BOOK IV.,"Where stood the Pylian orator, his band"
3658,BOOK IV.,Marshalling under all their leaders bold
3659,BOOK IV.,"Alastor, Chromius, Pelagon the vast,"
3660,BOOK IV.,"Hæmon the prince, and Bias, martial Chief.345"
3661,BOOK IV.,Chariot and horse he station’d in the front;
3662,BOOK IV.,"His numerous infantry, a strong reserve"
3663,BOOK IV.,"Right valiant, in the rear; the worst, and those"
3664,BOOK IV.,"In whom he trusted least, he drove between,"
3665,BOOK IV.,That such through mere necessity might act.350
3666,BOOK IV.,First to his charioteers he gave in charge
3667,BOOK IV.,"Their duty; bade them rein their horses hard,"
3668,BOOK IV.,"Shunning confusion. Let no warrior, vain"
3669,BOOK IV.,"And overweening of his strength or skill,"
3670,BOOK IV.,"Start from his rank to dare the fight alone,355"
3671,BOOK IV.,"Or fall behind it, weakening whom he leaves."
3672,BOOK IV.,"[13]And if, dismounted from his own, he climb"
3673,BOOK IV.,"Another’s chariot, let him not affect"
3674,BOOK IV.,"Perverse the reins, but let him stand, his spear"
3675,BOOK IV.,"Advancing firm, far better so employ’d.360"
3676,BOOK IV.,"Such was the discipline, in ancient times,"
3677,BOOK IV.,Of our forefathers; by these rules they fought
3678,BOOK IV.,"Successful, and laid many a city low."
3679,BOOK IV.,So counsell’d them the venerable Chief
3680,BOOK IV.,Long time expert in arms; him also saw365
3681,BOOK IV.,"King Agamemnon with delight, and said,"
3682,BOOK IV.,"Old Chief! ah how I wish, that thy firm heart"
3683,BOOK IV.,Were but supported by as firm a knee!
3684,BOOK IV.,But time unhinges all. Oh that some youth
3685,BOOK IV.,"Had thine old age, and thou wast young again!370"
3686,BOOK IV.,To whom the valiant Nestor thus replied.
3687,BOOK IV.,"Atrides, I could also ardent wish"
3688,BOOK IV.,That I were now robust as when I struck
3689,BOOK IV.,Brave Ereuthalion[14] breathless to the ground!
3690,BOOK IV.,But never all their gifts the Gods confer375
3691,BOOK IV.,On man at once; if then I had the force
3692,BOOK IV.,"Of youth, I suffer now the effects of age."
3693,BOOK IV.,"Yet ancient as I am, I will be seen"
3694,BOOK IV.,"Still mingling with the charioteers, still prompt"
3695,BOOK IV.,To give them counsel; for to counsel youth380
3696,BOOK IV.,Is the old warrior’s province. Let the green
3697,BOOK IV.,"In years, my juniors, unimpaired by time,"
3698,BOOK IV.,"Push with the lance, for they have strength to boast."
3699,BOOK IV.,"So he, whom Agamemnon joyful heard,"
3700,BOOK IV.,"And passing thence, the son of Peteos found385"
3701,BOOK IV.,"Menestheus, foremost in equestrian fame,"
3702,BOOK IV.,Among the brave Athenians; near to him
3703,BOOK IV.,"Ulysses held his station, and at hand"
3704,BOOK IV.,"The Cephallenians stood, hardy and bold;"
3705,BOOK IV.,For rumor none of the approaching fight390
3706,BOOK IV.,"Them yet had reach’d, so recent had the stir"
3707,BOOK IV.,"Arisen in either host; they, therefore, watch’d"
3708,BOOK IV.,Till the example of some other band
3709,BOOK IV.,"Marching, should prompt them to begin the fight,"
3710,BOOK IV.,"But Agamemnon, thus, the King of men395"
3711,BOOK IV.,"Them seeing, sudden and severe reproved."
3712,BOOK IV.,"Menestheus, son of Peteos prince renown’d,"
3713,BOOK IV.,"And thou, deviser of all evil wiles!"
3714,BOOK IV.,Adept in artifice! why stand ye here
3715,BOOK IV.,Appall’d? why wait ye on this distant spot400
3716,BOOK IV.,Till others move? I might expect from you
3717,BOOK IV.,"More readiness to meet the burning war,"
3718,BOOK IV.,Whom foremost I invite of all to share
3719,BOOK IV.,"The banquet, when the Princes feast with me."
3720,BOOK IV.,There ye are prompt; ye find it pleasant there405
3721,BOOK IV.,"To eat your savory food, and quaff your wine"
3722,BOOK IV.,Delicious till satiety ensue;
3723,BOOK IV.,But here you could be well content to stand
3724,BOOK IV.,"Spectators only, while ten Grecian troops"
3725,BOOK IV.,Should wage before you the wide-wasting war.410
3726,BOOK IV.,"To whom Ulysses, with resentful tone"
3727,BOOK IV.,"Dark-frowning, thus replied. What words are these"
3728,BOOK IV.,"Which have escaped thy lips; and for what cause,"
3729,BOOK IV.,"Atrides, hast thou call’d me slow to fight?"
3730,BOOK IV.,When we of Greece shall in sharp contest clash415
3731,BOOK IV.,"With you steed-tamer Trojans, mark me then;"
3732,BOOK IV.,Then thou shalt see (if the concerns of war
3733,BOOK IV.,"So nearly touch thee, and thou so incline)"
3734,BOOK IV.,"The father of Telemachus, engaged"
3735,BOOK IV.,Among the foremost Trojans. But thy speech420
3736,BOOK IV.,"Was light as is the wind, and rashly made."
3737,BOOK IV.,"When him thus moved he saw, the monarch smiled"
3738,BOOK IV.,"Complacent, and in gentler terms replied."
3739,BOOK IV.,"Laërtes’ noble son, for wiles renown’d!"
3740,BOOK IV.,Short reprimand and exhortation short425
3741,BOOK IV.,"Suffice for thee, nor did I purpose more."
3742,BOOK IV.,"For I have known thee long, that thou art one"
3743,BOOK IV.,"Of kindest nature, and so much my friend"
3744,BOOK IV.,"That we have both one heart. Go therefore thou,"
3745,BOOK IV.,"Lead on, and if a word have fallen amiss,430"
3746,BOOK IV.,"We will hereafter mend it, and may heaven"
3747,BOOK IV.,Obliterate in thine heart its whole effect!
3748,BOOK IV.,"He ceased, and ranging still along the line,"
3749,BOOK IV.,"The son of Tydeus, Diomede, perceived,"
3750,BOOK IV.,"Heroic Chief, by chariots all around435"
3751,BOOK IV.,"Environ’d, and by steeds, at side of whom"
3752,BOOK IV.,"Stood Sthenelus, the son of Capaneus."
3753,BOOK IV.,"Him also, Agamemnon, King of men,"
3754,BOOK IV.,In accents of asperity reproved.
3755,BOOK IV.,"Ah, son of Tydeus, Chief of dauntless heart440"
3756,BOOK IV.,And of equestrian fame! why standest thou
3757,BOOK IV.,"Appall’d, and peering through the walks of war?"
3758,BOOK IV.,So did not Tydeus. In the foremost fight
3759,BOOK IV.,"His favorite station was, as they affirm"
3760,BOOK IV.,Who witness’d his exploits; I never saw445
3761,BOOK IV.,"Or met him, but by popular report"
3762,BOOK IV.,He was the bravest warrior of his day.
3763,BOOK IV.,"Yet came he once, but not in hostile sort,"
3764,BOOK IV.,"To fair Mycenæ, by the godlike prince"
3765,BOOK IV.,"Attended, Polynices, at what time450"
3766,BOOK IV.,"The host was called together, and the siege"
3767,BOOK IV.,Was purposed of the sacred city Thebes.
3768,BOOK IV.,"Earnest they sued for an auxiliar band,"
3769,BOOK IV.,"Which we had gladly granted, but that Jove"
3770,BOOK IV.,By unpropitious tokens interfered.455
3771,BOOK IV.,"So forth they went, and on the reedy banks"
3772,BOOK IV.,"Arriving of Asopus, there thy sire"
3773,BOOK IV.,By designation of the Greeks was sent
3774,BOOK IV.,"Ambassador, and enter’d Thebes. He found"
3775,BOOK IV.,"In Eteocles’ palace numerous guests,460"
3776,BOOK IV.,"The sons of Cadmus feasting, among whom,"
3777,BOOK IV.,"Although a solitary stranger, stood"
3778,BOOK IV.,"Thy father without fear, and challenged forth"
3779,BOOK IV.,Their best to cope with him in manly games.
3780,BOOK IV.,"Them Tydeus vanquish’d easily, such aid465"
3781,BOOK IV.,Pallas vouchsafed him. Then the spur-arm’d race
3782,BOOK IV.,"Of Cadmus was incensed, and fifty youths"
3783,BOOK IV.,In ambush close expected his return.
3784,BOOK IV.,"Them, Lycophontes obstinate in fight,"
3785,BOOK IV.,"Son of Autophonus, and Mæon, son470"
3786,BOOK IV.,"Of Hæmon, Chief of godlike stature, led."
3787,BOOK IV.,"Those also Tydeus slew; Mæon except,"
3788,BOOK IV.,"(Whom, warned from heaven, he spared, and sent him home"
3789,BOOK IV.,With tidings of the rest) he slew them all.
3790,BOOK IV.,Such was Ætolian Tydeus; who begat475
3791,BOOK IV.,"A son in speech his better, not in arms."
3792,BOOK IV.,"He ended, and his sovereign’s awful voice"
3793,BOOK IV.,"Tydides reverencing, nought replied;"
3794,BOOK IV.,But thus the son of glorious Capaneus.
3795,BOOK IV.,"Atrides, conscious of the truth, speak truth.480"
3796,BOOK IV.,"We with our sires compared, superior praise"
3797,BOOK IV.,"Claim justly.[15] We, confiding in the aid"
3798,BOOK IV.,"Of Jove, and in propitious signs from heaven,"
3799,BOOK IV.,Led to the city consecrate to Mars
3800,BOOK IV.,"Our little host, inferior far to theirs,485"
3801,BOOK IV.,"And took seven-gated Thebes, under whose walls"
3802,BOOK IV.,Our fathers by their own imprudence fell.
3803,BOOK IV.,"Their glory, then, match never more with ours."
3804,BOOK IV.,"He spake, whom with a frowning brow the brave"
3805,BOOK IV.,"Tydides answer’d. Sthenelus, my friend!490"
3806,BOOK IV.,I give thee counsel. Mark it. Hold thy peace.
3807,BOOK IV.,"If Agamemnon, who hath charge of all,"
3808,BOOK IV.,"Excite his well-appointed host to war,"
3809,BOOK IV.,He hath no blame from me. For should the Greeks
3810,BOOK IV.,"(Her people vanquished) win imperial Troy,495"
3811,BOOK IV.,"The glory shall be his; or, if his host"
3812,BOOK IV.,"O’erpower’d in battle perish, his the shame."
3813,BOOK IV.,"Come, therefore; be it ours to rouse at once"
3814,BOOK IV.,To action all the fury of our might.
3815,BOOK IV.,"He said, and from his chariot to the plain500"
3816,BOOK IV.,Leap’d ardent; rang the armor on the breast
3817,BOOK IV.,Of the advancing Chief; the boldest heart
3818,BOOK IV.,"Had felt emotion, startled at the sound."
3819,BOOK IV.,As when the waves by Zephyrus up-heaved
3820,BOOK IV.,"Crowd fast toward some sounding shore, at first,505"
3821,BOOK IV.,On the broad bosom of the deep their heads
3822,BOOK IV.,"They curl on high, then breaking on the land"
3823,BOOK IV.,"Thunder, and o’er the rocks that breast the flood"
3824,BOOK IV.,"Borne turgid, scatter far the showery spray;"
3825,BOOK IV.,"So moved the Greeks successive, rank by rank,510"
3826,BOOK IV.,"And phalanx after phalanx, every Chief"
3827,BOOK IV.,"His loud command proclaiming, while the rest,"
3828,BOOK IV.,As voice in all those thousands none had been
3829,BOOK IV.,"Heard mute; and, in resplendent armor clad,"
3830,BOOK IV.,With martial order terrible advanced.515
3831,BOOK IV.,"Not so the Trojans came. As sheep, the flock"
3832,BOOK IV.,"Of some rich man, by thousands in his court"
3833,BOOK IV.,"Penn’d close at milking time, incessant bleat,"
3834,BOOK IV.,"Loud answering all their bleating lambs without,"
3835,BOOK IV.,Such din from Ilium’s wide-spread host arose.520
3836,BOOK IV.,"Nor was their shout, nor was their accent one,"
3837,BOOK IV.,But mingled languages were heard of men
3838,BOOK IV.,"From various climes. These Mars to battle roused,"
3839,BOOK IV.,Those Pallas azure-eyed; nor Terror thence
3840,BOOK IV.,"Nor Flight was absent, nor insatiate Strife,525"
3841,BOOK IV.,"Sister and mate of homicidal Mars,"
3842,BOOK IV.,"Who small at first, but swift to grow, from earth"
3843,BOOK IV.,Her towering crest lifts gradual to the skies.
3844,BOOK IV.,"She, foe alike to both, the brands dispersed"
3845,BOOK IV.,"Of burning hate between them, and the woes530"
3846,BOOK IV.,Enhanced of battle wheresoe’er she pass’d.
3847,BOOK IV.,And now the battle join’d. Shield clash’d with shield[16]
3848,BOOK IV.,"And spear with spear, conflicting corselets rang,"
3849,BOOK IV.,"Boss’d bucklers met, and tumult wild arose."
3850,BOOK IV.,"Then, many a yell was heard, and many a shout535"
3851,BOOK IV.,"Loud intermix’d, the slayer o’er the maim’d"
3852,BOOK IV.,"Exulting, and the field was drench’d with blood."
3853,BOOK IV.,As when two winter torrents rolling down
3854,BOOK IV.,"The mountains, shoot their floods through gulleys huge"
3855,BOOK IV.,"Into one gulf below, station’d remote540"
3856,BOOK IV.,The shepherd in the uplands hears the roar;
3857,BOOK IV.,Such was the thunder of the mingling hosts.
3858,BOOK IV.,"And first, Antilochus a Trojan Chief"
3859,BOOK IV.,"Slew Echepolus, from Thalysias sprung,"
3860,BOOK IV.,Contending valiant in the van of Troy.545
3861,BOOK IV.,"Him smiting on his crested casque, he drove"
3862,BOOK IV.,"The brazen lance into his front, and pierced"
3863,BOOK IV.,"The bones within; night overspread his eyes,"
3864,BOOK IV.,"And in fierce battle, like a tower, he fell."
3865,BOOK IV.,Him fallen by both feet Calchodon’s son550
3866,BOOK IV.,"Seized, royal Elephenor, leader brave"
3867,BOOK IV.,"Of the Abantes, and in haste to strip"
3868,BOOK IV.,"His armor, drew him from the fight aside."
3869,BOOK IV.,But short was that attempt. Him so employ’d
3870,BOOK IV.,"Dauntless Agenor mark’d, and as he stoop’d,555"
3871,BOOK IV.,In his unshielded flank a pointed spear
3872,BOOK IV.,Implanted deep; he languid sunk and died.
3873,BOOK IV.,"So Elephenor fell, for whom arose"
3874,BOOK IV.,Sharp conflict; Greeks and Trojans mutual flew
3875,BOOK IV.,"Like wolves to battle, and man grappled man.560"
3876,BOOK IV.,"Then Telamonian Ajax, in his prime"
3877,BOOK IV.,"Of youthful vigor Simöisius slew,[17]"
3878,BOOK IV.,Son of Anthemion. Him on Simoïs’ banks
3879,BOOK IV.,"His mother bore, when with her parents once"
3880,BOOK IV.,"She came from Ida down to view the flocks,565"
3881,BOOK IV.,And thence they named him; but his parents’
3882,BOOK IV.,"He lived not to requite, in early youth"
3883,BOOK IV.,Slain by the spear of Ajax famed in arms.
3884,BOOK IV.,For him advancing Ajax at the pap
3885,BOOK IV.,Wounded; right through his shoulder driven the point570
3886,BOOK IV.,"Stood forth behind; he fell, and press’d the dust."
3887,BOOK IV.,So in some spacious marsh the poplar falls
3888,BOOK IV.,"Smooth-skinn’d, with boughs unladen save aloft;"
3889,BOOK IV.,Some chariot-builder with his axe the trunk
3890,BOOK IV.,"Severs, that he may warp it to a wheel575"
3891,BOOK IV.,Of shapely form; meantime exposed it lies
3892,BOOK IV.,To parching airs beside the running stream;
3893,BOOK IV.,"Such Simöisius seemed, Anthemion’s son,"
3894,BOOK IV.,Whom noble Ajax slew. But soon at him
3895,BOOK IV.,"Antiphus, son of Priam, bright in arms,580"
3896,BOOK IV.,Hurl’d through the multitude his pointed spear.
3897,BOOK IV.,"He erred from Ajax, but he pierced the groin"
3898,BOOK IV.,"Of Leucus, valiant warrior of the band"
3899,BOOK IV.,Led by Ulysses. He the body dragg’d
3900,BOOK IV.,"Apart, but fell beside it, and let fall,585"
3901,BOOK IV.,"Breathless himself, the burthen from his hand."
3902,BOOK IV.,"Then burn’d Ulysses’ wrath for Leucus slain,"
3903,BOOK IV.,"And through the foremost combatants, array’d"
3904,BOOK IV.,"In dazzling arms, he rush’d. Full near he stood,"
3905,BOOK IV.,"And, looking keen around him, hurl’d a lance.590"
3906,BOOK IV.,Back fell the Trojans from before the face
3907,BOOK IV.,Dispersed of great Ulysses. Not in vain
3908,BOOK IV.,"His weapon flew, but on the field outstretch’d"
3909,BOOK IV.,"A spurious son of Priam, from the shores"
3910,BOOK IV.,"Call’d of Abydus famed for fleetest mares,595"
3911,BOOK IV.,"Democoon; him, for Leucus’ sake enraged,"
3912,BOOK IV.,Ulysses through both temples with his spear
3913,BOOK IV.,"Transpierced. The night of death hung on his eyes,"
3914,BOOK IV.,And sounding on his batter’d arms he fell.
3915,BOOK IV.,Then Hector and the van of Troy retired;600
3916,BOOK IV.,"Loud shout the Grecians; these draw off the dead,"
3917,BOOK IV.,"Those onward march amain, and from the heights"
3918,BOOK IV.,Of Pergamus Apollo looking down
3919,BOOK IV.,"In anger, to the Trojans called aloud."
3920,BOOK IV.,"Turn, turn, ye Trojans! face your Grecian foes.605"
3921,BOOK IV.,"They, like yourselves, are vulnerable flesh,"
3922,BOOK IV.,Not adamant or steel. Your direst dread
3923,BOOK IV.,"Achilles, son of Thetis radiant-hair’d,"
3924,BOOK IV.,"Fights not, but sullen in his fleet abides.[18]"
3925,BOOK IV.,Such from the citadel was heard the voice610
3926,BOOK IV.,Of dread Apollo. But Minerva ranged
3927,BOOK IV.,"Meantime, Tritonian progeny of Jove,"
3928,BOOK IV.,"The Grecians, rousing whom she saw remiss."
3929,BOOK IV.,"Then Amarynceus’ son, Diores, felt"
3930,BOOK IV.,"The force of fate, bruised by a rugged rock615"
3931,BOOK IV.,"At his right heel, which Pirus, Thracian Chief,"
3932,BOOK IV.,"The son of Imbrasus of Ænos, threw."
3933,BOOK IV.,Bones and both tendons in its fall the mass
3934,BOOK IV.,"Enormous crush’d. He, stretch’d in dust supine,"
3935,BOOK IV.,With palms outspread toward his warrior friends620
3936,BOOK IV.,Lay gasping life away. But he who gave
3937,BOOK IV.,"The fatal blow, Pirus, advancing, urged"
3938,BOOK IV.,"Into his navel a keen lance, and shed"
3939,BOOK IV.,"His bowels forth; then, darkness veil’d his eyes."
3940,BOOK IV.,Nor Pirus long survived; him through the breast625
3941,BOOK IV.,"Above the pap, Ætolian Thoas pierced,"
3942,BOOK IV.,And in his lungs set fast the quivering spear.
3943,BOOK IV.,"Then Thoas swift approach’d, pluck’d from the wound"
3944,BOOK IV.,"His stormy spear, and with his falchion bright"
3945,BOOK IV.,"Gashing his middle belly, stretch’d him dead.630"
3946,BOOK IV.,"Yet stripp’d he not the slain, whom with long spears"
3947,BOOK IV.,His Thracians hairy-scalp’d[19] so round about
3948,BOOK IV.,"Encompassed, that though bold and large of limb"
3949,BOOK IV.,"Were Thoas, from before them him they thrust"
3950,BOOK IV.,Staggering and reeling in his forced retreat.635
3951,BOOK IV.,"They therefore in the dust, the Epean Chief"
3952,BOOK IV.,"Diores, and the Thracian, Pirus lay"
3953,BOOK IV.,"Stretch’d side by side, with numerous slain around."
3954,BOOK IV.,Then had Minerva led through all that field
3955,BOOK IV.,"Some warrior yet unhurt, him sheltering safe640"
3956,BOOK IV.,"From all annoyance dread of dart or spear,"
3957,BOOK IV.,No cause of blame in either had he found
3958,BOOK IV.,"That day, so many Greeks and Trojans press’d,"

3999,BOOK V.,"At once, his sumptuous chariot left, down leap’d"
4000,BOOK V.,"Idæsus, wanting courage to defend25"
4001,BOOK V.,His brother slain; nor had he scaped himself
4002,BOOK V.,"His louring fate, but Vulcan, to preserve"
4003,BOOK V.,"His ancient priest from unmixt sorrow, snatch’d"
4004,BOOK V.,"The fugitive in darkness wrapt, away."
4005,BOOK V.,"Then brave Tydides, driving off the steeds,30"
4006,BOOK V.,"Consign’d them to his fellow-warriors’ care,"
4007,BOOK V.,That they might lead them down into the fleet.
4008,BOOK V.,"The valiant Trojans, when they saw the sons"
4009,BOOK V.,"Of Dares, one beside his chariot slain,"
4010,BOOK V.,"And one by flight preserved, through all their host35"
4011,BOOK V.,Felt consternation. Then Minerva seized
4012,BOOK V.,"The hand of fiery Mars, and thus she spake."
4013,BOOK V.,"Gore-tainted homicide, town-battering Mars!"
4014,BOOK V.,Leave we the Trojans and the Greeks to wage
4015,BOOK V.,"Fierce fight alone, Jove prospering whom he will,40"
4016,BOOK V.,So shall we not provoke our father’s ire.
4017,BOOK V.,"She said, and from the fight conducted forth"
4018,BOOK V.,"The impetuous Deity, whom on the side"
4019,BOOK V.,She seated of Scamander deep-embank’d.[3]
4020,BOOK V.,And now the host of Troy to flight inclined45
4021,BOOK V.,"Before the Grecians, and the Chiefs of Greece"
4022,BOOK V.,Each slew a warrior. Agamemnon first
4023,BOOK V.,Gigantic Odius from his chariot hurl’d.
4024,BOOK V.,Chief of the Halizonians. He to flight
4025,BOOK V.,"Turn’d foremost, when the monarch in his spine50"
4026,BOOK V.,"Between the shoulder-bones his spear infixt,"
4027,BOOK V.,"And urged it through his breast. Sounding he fell,"
4028,BOOK V.,And loud his batter’d armor rang around.
4029,BOOK V.,"By brave Idomeneus a Lydian died,"
4030,BOOK V.,"Phæstus, from fruitful Tarne sent to Troy,55"
4031,BOOK V.,Son of Mæonian Borus; him his steeds
4032,BOOK V.,"Mounting, Idomeneus the spear-renown’d"
4033,BOOK V.,Through his right shoulder pierced; unwelcome night
4034,BOOK V.,"Involved him; from his chariot down he fell,[4]"
4035,BOOK V.,And the attendant Cretans stripp’d his arms.60
4036,BOOK V.,"But Menelaus, son of Atreus slew"
4037,BOOK V.,"With his bright spear Scamandrius, Stropius’ son,"
4038,BOOK V.,"A skilful hunter; for Diana him,"
4039,BOOK V.,"Herself, the slaughter of all savage kinds"
4040,BOOK V.,"Had taught, on mountain or in forest bred.65"
4041,BOOK V.,"But she, shaft-aiming Goddess, in that hour"
4042,BOOK V.,"Avail’d him not, nor his own matchless skill;"
4043,BOOK V.,"For Menelaus, Atreus son spear-famed,"
4044,BOOK V.,Him flying wounded in the spine between
4045,BOOK V.,"His shoulders, and the spear urged through his breast.70"
4046,BOOK V.,Prone on his loud-resounding arms he fell.
4047,BOOK V.,"Next, by Meriones, Phereclus died,"
4048,BOOK V.,Son of Harmonides. All arts that ask
4049,BOOK V.,"A well-instructed hand his sire had learn’d,"
4050,BOOK V.,"For Pallas dearly loved him. He the fleet,75"
4051,BOOK V.,"Prime source of harm to Troy and to himself,"
4052,BOOK V.,"For Paris built, unskill’d to spell aright"
4053,BOOK V.,The oracles predictive of the wo.
4054,BOOK V.,Phereclus fled; Meriones his flight
4055,BOOK V.,"Outstripping, deep in his posterior flesh80"
4056,BOOK V.,A spear infix’d; sliding beneath the bone
4057,BOOK V.,"It grazed his bladder as it pass’d, and stood"
4058,BOOK V.,Protruded far before. Low on his knees
4059,BOOK V.,"Phereclus sank, and with a shriek expired."
4060,BOOK V.,"Pedæus, whom, although his spurious son,85"
4061,BOOK V.,"Antenor’s wife, to gratify her lord,"
4062,BOOK V.,Had cherish’d as her own—him Meges slew.
4063,BOOK V.,"Warlike Phylides[5] following close his flight,"
4064,BOOK V.,"His keen lance drove into his poll, cut sheer"
4065,BOOK V.,"His tongue within, and through his mouth enforced90"
4066,BOOK V.,"The glittering point. He, prostrate in the dust,"
4067,BOOK V.,The cold steel press’d between his teeth and died.
4068,BOOK V.,"Eurypylus, Evemon’s son, the brave"
4069,BOOK V.,"Hypsenor slew; Dolopion was his sire,"
4070,BOOK V.,"Priest of Scamander, reverenced as a God.95"
4071,BOOK V.,In vain before Eurypylus he fled;
4072,BOOK V.,"He, running, with his falchion lopp’d his arm"
4073,BOOK V.,Fast by the shoulder; on the field his hand
4074,BOOK V.,"Fell blood-distained, and destiny severe"
4075,BOOK V.,With shades of death for ever veil’d his eyes.100
4076,BOOK V.,Thus strenuous they the toilsome battle waged.
4077,BOOK V.,"But where Tydides fought, whether in aid"
4078,BOOK V.,"Of Ilium’s host, or on the part of Greece,"
4079,BOOK V.,Might none discern. For as a winter-flood
4080,BOOK V.,"Impetuous, mounds and bridges sweeps away;[6]105"
4081,BOOK V.,"The buttress’d bridge checks not its sudden force,"
4082,BOOK V.,The firm inclosure of vine-planted fields
4083,BOOK V.,"Luxuriant, falls before it; finish’d works"
4084,BOOK V.,"Of youthful hinds, once pleasant to the eye,"
4085,BOOK V.,"Now levell’d, after ceaseless rain from Jove;110"
4086,BOOK V.,So drove Tydides into sudden flight
4087,BOOK V.,The Trojans; phalanx after phalanx fled
4088,BOOK V.,Before the terror of his single arm.
4089,BOOK V.,When him Lycaon’s son illustrious saw
4090,BOOK V.,"Scouring the field, and from before his face115"
4091,BOOK V.,"The ranks dispersing wide, at once he bent"
4092,BOOK V.,Against Tydides his elastic bow.
4093,BOOK V.,The arrow met him in his swift career
4094,BOOK V.,Sure-aim’d; it struck direct the hollow mail
4095,BOOK V.,"Of his right shoulder, with resistless force120"
4096,BOOK V.,"Transfix’d it, and his hauberk stain’d with blood."
4097,BOOK V.,Loud shouted then Lycaon’s son renown’d.
4098,BOOK V.,"Rush on, ye Trojans, spur your coursers hard."
4099,BOOK V.,"Our fiercest foe is wounded, and I deem"
4100,BOOK V.,"His death not distant far, if me the King[7]125"
4101,BOOK V.,"Jove’s son, indeed, from Lycia sent to Troy."
4102,BOOK V.,So boasted Pandarus. Yet him the dart
4103,BOOK V.,"Quell’d not. Retreating, at his coursers’ heads"
4104,BOOK V.,"He stood, and to the son of Capaneus"
4105,BOOK V.,His charioteer and faithful friend he said.130
4106,BOOK V.,"Arise, sweet son of Capaneus, dismount,"
4107,BOOK V.,And from my shoulder draw this bitter shaft.
4108,BOOK V.,He spake; at once the son of Capaneus
4109,BOOK V.,"Descending, by its barb the bitter shaft"
4110,BOOK V.,Drew forth; blood spouted through his twisted mail135
4111,BOOK V.,"Incontinent, and thus the Hero pray’d."
4112,BOOK V.,Unconquer’d daughter of Jove Ægis-arm’d!
4113,BOOK V.,"If ever me, propitious, or my sire"
4114,BOOK V.,"Thou hast in furious fight help’d heretofore,"
4115,BOOK V.,Now aid me also. Bring within the reach140
4116,BOOK V.,"Of my swift spear, Oh grant me to strike through"
4117,BOOK V.,"The warrior who hath check’d my course, and boasts"
4118,BOOK V.,The sun’s bright beams for ever quench’d to me![8]
4119,BOOK V.,"He prayed, and Pallas heard; she braced his limbs,"
4120,BOOK V.,"She wing’d him with alacrity divine,145"
4121,BOOK V.,"And, standing at his side, him thus bespake."
4122,BOOK V.,"Now Diomede, be bold! Fight now with Troy."
4123,BOOK V.,"To thee, thy father’s spirit I impart"
4124,BOOK V.,Fearless; shield-shaking Tydeus felt the same.
4125,BOOK V.,I also from thine eye the darkness purge150
4126,BOOK V.,"Which dimm’d thy sight[9] before, that thou may’st know"
4127,BOOK V.,"Both Gods and men; should, therefore, other God"
4128,BOOK V.,"Approach to try thee, fight not with the powers"
4129,BOOK V.,"Immortal; but if foam-born Venus come,"
4130,BOOK V.,Her spare not. Wound her with thy glittering spear.155
4131,BOOK V.,"So spake the blue-eyed Deity, and went,"
4132,BOOK V.,Then with the champions in the van again
4133,BOOK V.,"Tydides mingled; hot before, he fights"
4134,BOOK V.,"With threefold fury now, nor less enraged"
4135,BOOK V.,Than some gaunt lion whom o’erleaping light160
4136,BOOK V.,"The fold, a shepherd hath but gall’d, not kill’d,"
4137,BOOK V.,Him irritating more; thenceforth the swain
4138,BOOK V.,Lurks unresisting; flies the abandon’d flock;
4139,BOOK V.,"Heaps slain on heaps he leaves, and with a bound"
4140,BOOK V.,"Surmounting all impediment, escapes;165"
4141,BOOK V.,Such seem’d the valiant Diomede incensed
4142,BOOK V.,"To fury, mingling with the host of Troy."
4143,BOOK V.,Astynoüs and Hypenor first he slew;
4144,BOOK V.,One with his brazen lance above the pap
4145,BOOK V.,"He pierced, and one with his huge falchion smote170"
4146,BOOK V.,"Fast by the key-bone,[10] from the neck and spine"
4147,BOOK V.,His parted shoulder driving at a blow.
4148,BOOK V.,"Them leaving, Polyides next he sought"
4149,BOOK V.,"And Abas, sons of a dream-dealing seer,"
4150,BOOK V.,Eurydamas; their hoary father’s dreams175
4151,BOOK V.,"Or not interpreted, or kept concealed,"
4152,BOOK V.,"Them saved not, for by Diomede they died."
4153,BOOK V.,"Xanthus and Thöon he encounter’d next,"
4154,BOOK V.,"Both sons of Phænops, sons of his old age,"
4155,BOOK V.,"Who other heir had none of all his wealth,180"
4156,BOOK V.,"Nor hoped another, worn with many years."
4157,BOOK V.,Tydides slew them both; nor aught remain’d
4158,BOOK V.,To the old man but sorrow for his sons
4159,BOOK V.,"For ever lost, and strangers were his heirs."
4160,BOOK V.,Two sons of Priam in one chariot borne185
4161,BOOK V.,"Echemon next, and Chromius felt his hand"
4162,BOOK V.,Resistless. As a lion on the herd
4163,BOOK V.,"Leaping, while they the shrubs and bushes browse,"
4164,BOOK V.,"Breaks short the neck of heifer or of steer,"
4165,BOOK V.,"So them, though clinging fast and loth to fall,190"
4166,BOOK V.,"Tydides hurl’d together to the ground,"
4167,BOOK V.,"Then stripp’d their splendid armor, and the steeds"
4168,BOOK V.,Consigned and chariot to his soldiers’ care.
4169,BOOK V.,"Æneas him discern’d scattering the ranks,"
4170,BOOK V.,And through the battle and the clash of spears195
4171,BOOK V.,Went seeking godlike Pandarus; ere long
4172,BOOK V.,"Finding Lycaon’s martial son renown’d,"
4173,BOOK V.,"He stood before him, and him thus address’d."
4174,BOOK V.,"Thy bow, thy feather’d shafts, and glorious name"
4175,BOOK V.,"Where are they, Pandarus? whom none of Troy200"
4176,BOOK V.,"Could equal, whom of Lycia, none excel."
4177,BOOK V.,"Come. Lift thine hands to Jove, and at yon Chief"
4178,BOOK V.,"Dispatch an arrow, who afflicts the host"
4179,BOOK V.,"Of Ilium thus, conquering where’er he flies,"
4180,BOOK V.,"And who hath slaughter’d numerous brave in arms,205"
4181,BOOK V.,But him some Deity I rather deem
4182,BOOK V.,"Avenging on us his neglected rites,"
4183,BOOK V.,And who can stand before an angry God?
4184,BOOK V.,Him answer’d then Lycaon’s son renown’d.
4185,BOOK V.,"Brave leader of the Trojans brazen-mail’d,210"
4186,BOOK V.,"Æneas! By his buckler which I know,"
4187,BOOK V.,"And by his helmet’s height, considering, too"
4188,BOOK V.,"His steeds, I deem him Diomede the bold;"
4189,BOOK V.,"Yet such pronounce him not, who seems a God."
4190,BOOK V.,But if bold Diomede indeed he be215
4191,BOOK V.,"Of whom I speak, not without aid from heaven"
4192,BOOK V.,"His fury thus prevails, but at his side"
4193,BOOK V.,"Some God, in clouds enveloped, turns away"
4194,BOOK V.,From him the arrow to a devious course.
4195,BOOK V.,"Already, at his shoulder’s hollow mail220"
4196,BOOK V.,"My shaft hath pierced him through, and him I deem’d"
4197,BOOK V.,Dismiss’d full sure to Pluto ere his time
4198,BOOK V.,But he survives; whom therefore I at last
4199,BOOK V.,Perforce conclude some angry Deity.
4200,BOOK V.,"Steeds have I none or chariot to ascend,225"
4201,BOOK V.,Who have eleven chariots in the stands
4202,BOOK V.,"Left of Lycaon, with fair hangings all"
4203,BOOK V.,"O’ermantled, strong, new finish’d, with their steeds"
4204,BOOK V.,"In pairs beside them, eating winnow’d grain."
4205,BOOK V.,Me much Lycaon my old valiant sire230
4206,BOOK V.,At my departure from his palace gates
4207,BOOK V.,"Persuaded, that my chariot and my steeds"
4208,BOOK V.,"Ascending, I should so conduct my bands"
4209,BOOK V.,"To battle; counsel wise, and ill-refused!"
4210,BOOK V.,"But anxious, lest (the host in Troy so long235"
4211,BOOK V.,"Immew’d) my steeds, fed plenteously at home,"
4212,BOOK V.,"Should here want food, I left them, and on foot"
4213,BOOK V.,"To Ilium came, confiding in my bow"
4214,BOOK V.,Ordain’d at last to yield me little good.
4215,BOOK V.,"Twice have I shot, and twice I struck the mark,240"
4216,BOOK V.,"First Menelaus, and Tydides next;"
4217,BOOK V.,"From each I drew the blood, true, genuine blood,"
4218,BOOK V.,Yet have but more incensed them. In an hour
4219,BOOK V.,"Unfortunate, I therefore took my bow"
4220,BOOK V.,"Down from the wall that day, when for the sake245"
4221,BOOK V.,"Of noble Hector, to these pleasant plains"
4222,BOOK V.,"I came, a leader on the part of Troy."
4223,BOOK V.,"But should I once return, and with these eyes"
4224,BOOK V.,"Again behold my native land, my sire,"
4225,BOOK V.,"My wife, my stately mansion, may the hand,250"
4226,BOOK V.,"That moment, of some adversary there"
4227,BOOK V.,"Shorten me by the head, if I not snap"
4228,BOOK V.,"This bow with which I charged myself in vain,"
4229,BOOK V.,And burn the unprofitable tool to dust.
4230,BOOK V.,"To whom Æneas, Trojan Chief, replied.255"
4231,BOOK V.,"Nay, speak not so. For ere that hour arrive"
4232,BOOK V.,"We will, with chariot and with horse, in arms"
4233,BOOK V.,"Encounter him, and put his strength to proof."
4234,BOOK V.,"Delay not, mount my chariot. Thou shalt see"
4235,BOOK V.,With what rapidity the steeds of Troy260
4236,BOOK V.,"Pursuing or retreating, scour the field."
4237,BOOK V.,"If after all, Jove purpose still to exalt"
4238,BOOK V.,"The son of Tydeus, these shall bear us safe"
4239,BOOK V.,Back to the city. Come then. Let us on.
4240,BOOK V.,"The lash take thou, and the resplendent reins,265"
4241,BOOK V.,"While I alight for battle, or thyself"
4242,BOOK V.,"Receive them, and the steeds shall be my care."
4243,BOOK V.,Him answer’d then Lycaon’s son renown’d.
4244,BOOK V.,"Æneas! manage thou the reins, and guide"
4245,BOOK V.,Thy proper steeds. If fly at last we must270
4246,BOOK V.,"The son of Tydeus, they will readier draw"
4247,BOOK V.,Directed by their wonted charioteer.
4248,BOOK V.,"Else, terrified, and missing thy control,"
4249,BOOK V.,"They may refuse to bear us from the fight,"
4250,BOOK V.,"And Tydeus’ son assailing us, with ease275"
4251,BOOK V.,"Shall slay us both, and drive thy steeds away."
4252,BOOK V.,"Rule therefore thou the chariot, and myself"
4253,BOOK V.,With my sharp spear will his assault receive.
4254,BOOK V.,"So saying, they mounted both, and furious drove"
4255,BOOK V.,Against Tydides. Them the noble son280
4256,BOOK V.,"Of Capaneus observed, and turning quick"
4257,BOOK V.,"His speech to Diomede, him thus address’d."
4258,BOOK V.,"Tydides, Diomede, my heart’s delight!"
4259,BOOK V.,Two warriors of immeasurable force
4260,BOOK V.,"In battle, ardent to contend with thee,285"
4261,BOOK V.,"Come rattling on. Lycaon’s offspring one,"
4262,BOOK V.,Bow-practised Pandarus; with whom appears
4263,BOOK V.,Æneas; he who calls the mighty Chief
4264,BOOK V.,"Anchises father, and whom Venus bore."
4265,BOOK V.,Mount—drive we swift away—lest borne so far290
4266,BOOK V.,"Beyond the foremost battle, thou be slain."
4267,BOOK V.,"To whom, dark-frowning, Diomede replied"
4268,BOOK V.,"Speak not of flight to me, who am disposed"
4269,BOOK V.,To no such course. I am ashamed to fly
4270,BOOK V.,"Or tremble, and my strength is still entire;295"
4271,BOOK V.,"I cannot mount. No. Rather thus, on foot,"
4272,BOOK V.,I will advance against them. Fear and dread
4273,BOOK V.,Are not for me; Pallas forbids the thought.
4274,BOOK V.,"One falls, be sure; swift as they are, the steeds"
4275,BOOK V.,"That whirl them on, shall never rescue both.300"
4276,BOOK V.,"But hear my bidding, and hold fast the word."
4277,BOOK V.,Should all-wise Pallas grant me my desire
4278,BOOK V.,"To slay them both, drive not my coursers hence,"
4279,BOOK V.,"But hook the reins, and seizing quick the pair"
4280,BOOK V.,"That draw Æneas, urge them from the powers305"
4281,BOOK V.,Of Troy away into the host of Greece.
4282,BOOK V.,For they are sprung from those which Jove to Tros
4283,BOOK V.,In compensation gave for Ganymede;
4284,BOOK V.,The Sun himself sees not their like below.
4285,BOOK V.,"Anchises, King of men, clandestine them310"
4286,BOOK V.,"Obtain’d, his mares submitting to the steeds"
4287,BOOK V.,Of King Laomedon. Six brought him foals;
4288,BOOK V.,"Four to himself reserving, in his stalls"
4289,BOOK V.,"He fed them sleek, and two he gave his son:"
4290,BOOK V.,"These, might we win them, were a noble prize.315"
4291,BOOK V.,"Thus mutual they conferr’d; those Chiefs, the while,"
4292,BOOK V.,"With swiftest pace approach’d, and first his speech"
4293,BOOK V.,To Diomede Lycaon’s son address’d.
4294,BOOK V.,"Heroic offspring of a noble sire,"
4295,BOOK V.,Brave son of Tydeus! false to my intent320
4296,BOOK V.,My shaft hath harm’d thee little. I will now
4297,BOOK V.,"Make trial with my spear, if that may speed."
4298,BOOK V.,"He said, and shaking his long-shadow’d spear,"
4299,BOOK V.,Dismiss’d it. Forceful on the shield it struck
4300,BOOK V.,"Of Diomede, transpierced it, and approach’d325"
4301,BOOK V.,With threatening point the hauberk on his breast.
4302,BOOK V.,Loud shouted Pandarus—Ah nobly thrown!
4303,BOOK V.,"Home to thy bowels. Die, for die thou must,"
4304,BOOK V.,And all the glory of thy death is mine.
4305,BOOK V.,Then answer thus brave Diomede return’d330
4306,BOOK V.,Undaunted. I am whole. Thy cast was short.
4307,BOOK V.,"But ye desist not, as I plain perceive,"
4308,BOOK V.,Till one at least extended on the plain
4309,BOOK V.,Shall sate the God of battles with his blood.
4310,BOOK V.,He said and threw. Pallas the spear herself335
4311,BOOK V.,Directed; at his eye fast by the nose
4312,BOOK V.,"Deep-entering, through his ivory teeth it pass’d,"
4313,BOOK V.,At its extremity divided sheer
4314,BOOK V.,"His tongue, and started through his chin below."
4315,BOOK V.,"He headlong fell, and with his dazzling arms340"
4316,BOOK V.,Smote full the plain. Back flew the fiery steeds
4317,BOOK V.,"With swift recoil, and where he fell he died."
4318,BOOK V.,"Then sprang Æneas forth with spear and shield,"
4319,BOOK V.,That none might drag the body;[11] lion-like
4320,BOOK V.,"He stalk’d around it, oval shield and spear345"
4321,BOOK V.,"Advancing firm, and with incessant cries"
4322,BOOK V.,"Terrific, death denouncing on his foes."
4323,BOOK V.,But Diomede with hollow grasp a stone
4324,BOOK V.,"Enormous seized, a weight to overtask"
4325,BOOK V.,"Two strongest men of such as now are strong,350"
4326,BOOK V.,"Yet he, alone, wielded the rock with ease."
4327,BOOK V.,"Full on the hip he smote him, where the thigh"
4328,BOOK V.,"Rolls in its cavity, the socket named."
4329,BOOK V.,"He crushed the socket, lacerated wide"
4330,BOOK V.,"Both tendons, and with that rough-angled mass355"
4331,BOOK V.,"Flay’d all his flesh, The Hero on his knees"
4332,BOOK V.,"Sank, on his ample palm his weight upbore"
4333,BOOK V.,"Laboring, and darkness overspread his eyes."
4334,BOOK V.,"There had Æneas perish’d, King of men,"
4335,BOOK V.,Had not Jove’s daughter Venus quick perceived360
4336,BOOK V.,"His peril imminent, whom she had borne"
4337,BOOK V.,Herself to Anchises pasturing his herds.
4338,BOOK V.,Her snowy arras her darling son around
4339,BOOK V.,"She threw maternal, and behind a fold"
4340,BOOK V.,Of her bright mantle screening close his breast365
4341,BOOK V.,"From mortal harm by some brave Grecian’s spear,"
4342,BOOK V.,Stole him with eager swiftness from the fight.
4343,BOOK V.,Nor then forgat brave Sthenelus his charge
4344,BOOK V.,"Received from Diomede, but his own steeds"
4345,BOOK V.,"Detaining distant from the boisterous war,370"
4346,BOOK V.,"Stretch’d tight the reins, and hook’d them fast behind."
4347,BOOK V.,The coursers of Æneas next he seized
4348,BOOK V.,"Ardent, and them into the host of Greece"
4349,BOOK V.,"Driving remote, consign’d them to his care,"
4350,BOOK V.,Whom far above all others his compeers375
4351,BOOK V.,"He loved, Deipylus, his bosom friend"
4352,BOOK V.,Congenial. Him he charged to drive them thence
4353,BOOK V.,"Into the fleet, then, mounting swift his own,"
4354,BOOK V.,"Lash’d after Diomede; he, fierce in arms,"
4355,BOOK V.,"Pursued the Cyprian Goddess, conscious whom,380"
4356,BOOK V.,"Not Pallas, not Enyo, waster dread"
4357,BOOK V.,"Of cities close-beleaguer’d, none of all"
4358,BOOK V.,"Who o’er the battle’s bloody course preside,"
4359,BOOK V.,But one of softer kind and prone to fear.
4360,BOOK V.,"When, therefore, her at length, after long chase385"
4361,BOOK V.,"Through all the warring multitude he reach’d,"
4362,BOOK V.,With his protruded spear her gentle hand
4363,BOOK V.,"He wounded, piercing through her thin attire"
4364,BOOK V.,"Ambrosial, by themselves the graces wrought,"
4365,BOOK V.,"Her inside wrist, fast by the rosy palm.390"
4366,BOOK V.,"Blood follow’d, but immortal; ichor pure,"
4367,BOOK V.,Such as the blest inhabitants of heaven
4368,BOOK V.,"May bleed, nectareous; for the Gods eat not"
4369,BOOK V.,"Man’s food, nor slake as he with sable wine"
4370,BOOK V.,"Their thirst, thence bloodless and from death exempt.395"
4371,BOOK V.,"She, shrieking, from her arms cast down her son,"
4372,BOOK V.,"And Phœbus, in impenetrable clouds"
4373,BOOK V.,"Him hiding, lest the spear of some brave Greek"
4374,BOOK V.,"Should pierce his bosom, caught him swift away."
4375,BOOK V.,Then shouted brave Tydides after her—400
4376,BOOK V.,"Depart, Jove’s daughter! fly the bloody field."
4377,BOOK V.,Is’t not enough that thou beguilest the hearts
4378,BOOK V.,Of feeble women? If thou dare intrude
4379,BOOK V.,"Again into the war, war’s very name"
4380,BOOK V.,"Shall make thee shudder, wheresoever heard.405"
4381,BOOK V.,"He said, and Venus with excess of pain"
4382,BOOK V.,Bewilder’d went; but Iris tempest-wing’d
4383,BOOK V.,"Forth led her through the multitude, oppress’d"
4384,BOOK V.,"With anguish, her white wrist to livid changed."
4385,BOOK V.,They came where Mars far on the left retired410
4386,BOOK V.,"Of battle sat, his horses and his spear"
4387,BOOK V.,In darkness veil’d. Before her brother’s knees
4388,BOOK V.,"She fell, and with entreaties urgent sought"
4389,BOOK V.,The succor of his coursers golden-rein’d.
4390,BOOK V.,"Save me, my brother! Pity me! Thy steeds415"
4391,BOOK V.,"Give me, that they may bear me to the heights"
4392,BOOK V.,"Olympian, seat of the immortal Gods!"
4393,BOOK V.,Oh! I am wounded deep; a mortal man
4394,BOOK V.,"Hath done it, Diomede; nor would he fear"
4395,BOOK V.,This day in fight the Sire himself of all.420
4396,BOOK V.,Then Mars his coursers gold-caparison’d
4397,BOOK V.,"Resign’d to Venus; she, with countenance sad,"
4398,BOOK V.,"The chariot climb’d, and Iris at her side"
4399,BOOK V.,The bright reins seizing lash’d the ready steeds.
4400,BOOK V.,"Soon as the Olympian heights, seat of the Gods,425"
4401,BOOK V.,"They reach’d, wing-footed Iris loosing quick"
4402,BOOK V.,"The coursers, gave them large whereon to browse"
4403,BOOK V.,Ambrosial food; but Venus on the knees
4404,BOOK V.,"Sank of Dione, who with folded arms"
4405,BOOK V.,"Maternal, to her bosom straining close430"
4406,BOOK V.,"Her daughter, stroked her cheek, and thus inquired."
4407,BOOK V.,My darling child! who? which of all the Gods
4408,BOOK V.,Hath rashly done such violence to thee
4409,BOOK V.,As if convicted of some open wrong?
4410,BOOK V.,Her then the Goddess of love-kindling smiles435
4411,BOOK V.,"Venus thus answer’d; Diomede the proud,"
4412,BOOK V.,"Audacious Diomede; he gave the wound,"
4413,BOOK V.,For that I stole Æneas from the fight
4414,BOOK V.,My son of all mankind my most beloved;
4415,BOOK V.,"Nor is it now the war of Greece with Troy,440"
4416,BOOK V.,But of the Grecians with the Gods themselves.
4417,BOOK V.,"Then thus Dione, Goddess all divine."
4418,BOOK V.,My child! how hard soe’er thy sufferings seem
4419,BOOK V.,Endure them patiently. Full many a wrong
4420,BOOK V.,"From human hands profane the Gods endure,445"
4421,BOOK V.,"And many a painful stroke, mankind from ours."
4422,BOOK V.,"Mars once endured much wrong, when on a time"
4423,BOOK V.,"Him Otus bound and Ephialtes fast,"
4424,BOOK V.,"Sons of Alöeus, and full thirteen moons"
4425,BOOK V.,"In brazen thraldom held him. There, at length,450"
4426,BOOK V.,"The fierce blood-nourished Mars had pined away,"
4427,BOOK V.,"But that Eëribœa, loveliest nymph,"
4428,BOOK V.,"His step-mother, in happy hour disclosed"
4429,BOOK V.,To Mercury the story of his wrongs;
4430,BOOK V.,"He stole the prisoner forth, but with his woes455"
4431,BOOK V.,"Already worn, languid and fetter-gall’d."
4432,BOOK V.,"Nor Juno less endured, when erst the bold"
4433,BOOK V.,Son of Amphytrion with tridental shaft
4434,BOOK V.,Her bosom pierced; she then the misery felt
4435,BOOK V.,Of irremediable pain severe.460
4436,BOOK V.,"Nor suffer’d Pluto less, of all the Gods"
4437,BOOK V.,"Gigantic most, by the same son of Jove"
4438,BOOK V.,"Alcides, at the portals of the dead"
4439,BOOK V.,Transfix’d and fill’d with anguish; he the house
4440,BOOK V.,Of Jove and the Olympian summit sought465
4441,BOOK V.,"Dejected, torture-stung, for sore the shaft"
4442,BOOK V.,"Oppress’d him, into his huge shoulder driven."
4443,BOOK V.,But Pæon[12] him not liable to death
4444,BOOK V.,With unction smooth of salutiferous balms
4445,BOOK V.,"Heal’d soon. Presumptuous, sacrilegious man!470"
4446,BOOK V.,"Careless what dire enormities he wrought,"
4447,BOOK V.,Who bent his bow against the powers of heaven!
4448,BOOK V.,But blue-eyed Pallas instigated him
4449,BOOK V.,By whom thou bleed’st. Infatuate! he forgets
4450,BOOK V.,That whoso turns against the Gods his arm475
4451,BOOK V.,"Lives never long; he never, safe escaped"
4452,BOOK V.,"From furious fight, the lisp’d caresses hears"
4453,BOOK V.,Of his own infants prattling at his knees.
4454,BOOK V.,"Let therefore Diomede beware, lest strong"
4455,BOOK V.,"And valiant as he is, he chance to meet490"
4456,BOOK V.,"Some mightier foe than thou, and lest his wife,"
4457,BOOK V.,"Daughter of King Adrastus, the discrete"
4458,BOOK V.,"Ægialea, from portentous dreams"
4459,BOOK V.,"Upstarting, call her family to wail"
4460,BOOK V.,"Her first-espoused, Achaia’s proudest boast,485"
4461,BOOK V.,"Diomede, whom she must behold no more."
4462,BOOK V.,"She said, and from her wrist with both hands wiped"
4463,BOOK V.,The trickling ichor; the effectual touch
4464,BOOK V.,"Divine chased all her pains, and she was heal’d."
4465,BOOK V.,"Them Juno mark’d and Pallas, and with speech490"
4466,BOOK V.,Sarcastic pointed at Saturnian Jove
4467,BOOK V.,"To vex him, blue-eyed Pallas thus began."
4468,BOOK V.,"Eternal father! may I speak my thought,"
4469,BOOK V.,"And not incense thee, Jove? I can but judge"
4470,BOOK V.,"That Venus, while she coax’d some Grecian fair495"
4471,BOOK V.,To accompany the Trojans whom she loves
4472,BOOK V.,"With such extravagance, hath heedless stroked"
4473,BOOK V.,"Her golden clasps, and scratch’d her lily hand."
4474,BOOK V.,"So she; then smiled the sire of Gods and men,"
4475,BOOK V.,"And calling golden Venus, her bespake.500"
4476,BOOK V.,"War and the tented field, my beauteous child,"
4477,BOOK V.,Are not for thee. Thou rather shouldst be found
4478,BOOK V.,In scenes of matrimonial bliss. The toils
4479,BOOK V.,Of war to Pallas and to Mars belong.
4480,BOOK V.,Thus they in heaven. But Diomede the while505
4481,BOOK V.,"Sprang on Æneas, conscious of the God"
4482,BOOK V.,"Whose hand o’ershadow’d him, yet even him"
4483,BOOK V.,Regarding lightly; for he burn’d to slay
4484,BOOK V.,"Æneas, and to seize his glorious arms."
4485,BOOK V.,"Thrice then he sprang impetuous to the deed,510"
4486,BOOK V.,And thrice Apollo with his radiant shield
4487,BOOK V.,Repulsed him. But when ardent as a God
4488,BOOK V.,"The fourth time he advanced, with thundering-voice"
4489,BOOK V.,Him thus the Archer of the skies rebuked.
4490,BOOK V.,"Think, and retire, Tydides! nor affect515"
4491,BOOK V.,Equality with Gods; for not the same
4492,BOOK V.,Our nature is and theirs who tread the ground.
4493,BOOK V.,"He spake, and Diomede a step retired,"
4494,BOOK V.,Not more; the anger of the Archer-God
4495,BOOK V.,"Declining slow, and with a sullen awe.520"
4496,BOOK V.,"Then Phœbus, far from all the warrior throng"
4497,BOOK V.,To his own shrine the sacred dome beneath
4498,BOOK V.,"Of Pergamus, Æneas bore; there him"
4499,BOOK V.,Latona and shaft-arm’d Diana heal’d
4500,BOOK V.,And glorified within their spacious fane.525
4501,BOOK V.,Meantime the Archer of the silver bow
4502,BOOK V.,A visionary form prepared; it seem’d
4503,BOOK V.,"Himself Æneas, and was arm’d as he."
4504,BOOK V.,"At once, in contest for that airy form,"
4505,BOOK V.,Grecians and Trojans on each other’s breasts530
4506,BOOK V.,The bull-hide buckler batter’d and light targe.
4507,BOOK V.,Then thus Apollo to the warrior God.
4508,BOOK V.,"Gore-tainted homicide, town-batterer Mars!"
4509,BOOK V.,Wilt thou not meet and from the fight withdraw
4510,BOOK V.,"This man Tydides, now so fiery grown535"
4511,BOOK V.,That he would even cope with Jove himself?
4512,BOOK V.,"First Venus’ hand he wounded, and assail’d"
4513,BOOK V.,"Impetuous as a God, next, even me."
4514,BOOK V.,"He ceased, and on the topmost turret sat"
4515,BOOK V.,Of Pergamus. Then all-destroyer Mars540
4516,BOOK V.,"Ranging the Trojan host, rank after rank"
4517,BOOK V.,"Exhorted loud, and in the form assumed"
4518,BOOK V.,"Of Acamas the Thracian leader bold,"
4519,BOOK V.,The godlike sons of Priam thus harangued.
4520,BOOK V.,"Ye sons of Priam, monarch Jove-beloved!545"
4521,BOOK V.,How long permit ye your Achaian foes
4522,BOOK V.,To slay the people?—till the battle rage
4523,BOOK V.,(Push’d home to Ilium) at her solid gates?
4524,BOOK V.,"Behold—a Chief disabled lies, than whom"
4525,BOOK V.,"We reverence not even Hector more,550"
4526,BOOK V.,"Æneas; fly, save from the roaring storm"
4527,BOOK V.,The noble Anchisiades your friend.
4528,BOOK V.,He said; then every heart for battle glow’d;
4529,BOOK V.,And thus Sarpedon with rebuke severe
4530,BOOK V.,"Upbraiding generous Hector, stern began.555"
4531,BOOK V.,"Where is thy courage, Hector? for thou once"
4532,BOOK V.,Hadst courage. Is it fled? In other days
4533,BOOK V.,Thy boast hath been that without native troops
4534,BOOK V.,"Or foreign aids, thy kindred and thyself"
4535,BOOK V.,"Alone, were guard sufficient for the town.560"
4536,BOOK V.,But none of all thy kindred now appears;
4537,BOOK V.,I can discover none; they stand aloof
4538,BOOK V.,"Quaking, as dogs that hear the lion’s roar."
4539,BOOK V.,"We bear the stress, who are but Troy’s allies;"
4540,BOOK V.,"Myself am such, and from afar I came;565"
4541,BOOK V.,For Lycia lies far distant on the banks
4542,BOOK V.,Of the deep-eddied Xanthus. There a wife
4543,BOOK V.,"I left and infant son, both dear to me,"
4544,BOOK V.,"With plenteous wealth, the wish of all who want."
4545,BOOK V.,"Yet urge I still my Lycians, and am prompt570"
4546,BOOK V.,"Myself to fight, although possessing here"
4547,BOOK V.,Nought that the Greeks can carry or drive hence.
4548,BOOK V.,"But there stand’st thou, neither employed thyself,"
4549,BOOK V.,Nor moving others to an active part
4550,BOOK V.,For all their dearest pledges. Oh beware!575
4551,BOOK V.,"Lest, as with meshes of an ample net,"
4552,BOOK V.,"At one huge draught the Grecians sweep you all,"
4553,BOOK V.,And desolate at once your populous Troy!
4554,BOOK V.,"By day, by night, thoughts such as these should still"
4555,BOOK V.,"Thy conduct influence, and from Chief to Chief580"
4556,BOOK V.,"Of the allies should send thee, praying each"
4557,BOOK V.,"To make firm stand, all bickerings put away."
4558,BOOK V.,"So spake Sarpedon, and his reprimand"
4559,BOOK V.,Stung Hector; instant to the ground he leap’d
4560,BOOK V.,"All arm’d, and shaking his bright spears his host585"
4561,BOOK V.,Ranged in all quarters animating loud
4562,BOOK V.,"His legions, and rekindling horrid war."
4563,BOOK V.,"Then, rolling back, the powers of Troy opposed"
4564,BOOK V.,"Once more the Grecians, whom the Grecians dense"
4565,BOOK V.,"Expected, unretreating, void of fear.590"
4566,BOOK V.,As flies the chaff wide scatter’d by the wind
4567,BOOK V.,"O’er all the consecrated floor, what time"
4568,BOOK V.,Ripe Ceres[13] with brisk airs her golden grain
4569,BOOK V.,"Ventilates, whitening with its husk the ground;"
4570,BOOK V.,"So grew the Achaians white, a dusty cloud595"
4571,BOOK V.,"Descending on their arms, which steeds with steeds"
4572,BOOK V.,"Again to battle mingling, with their hoofs"
4573,BOOK V.,Up-stamp’d into the brazen vault of heaven;
4574,BOOK V.,For now the charioteers turn’d all to fight.
4575,BOOK V.,Host toward host with full collected force600
4576,BOOK V.,They moved direct. Then Mars through all the field
4577,BOOK V.,"Took wide his range, and overhung the war"
4578,BOOK V.,"With night, in aid of Troy, at the command"
4579,BOOK V.,Of Phœbus of the golden sword; for he
4580,BOOK V.,"Perceiving Pallas from the field withdrawn,605"
4581,BOOK V.,"Patroness of the Greeks, had Mars enjoin’d"
4582,BOOK V.,To rouse the spirit of the Trojan host.
4583,BOOK V.,Meantime Apollo from his unctuous shrine
4584,BOOK V.,Sent forth restored and with new force inspired
4585,BOOK V.,"Æneas. He amidst his warriors stood,610"
4586,BOOK V.,"Who him with joy beheld still living, heal’d,"
4587,BOOK V.,And all his strength possessing unimpair’d.
4588,BOOK V.,Yet no man ask’d him aught. No leisure now
4589,BOOK V.,For question was; far other thoughts had they;
4590,BOOK V.,"Such toils the archer of the silver bow,615"
4591,BOOK V.,"Wide-slaughtering Mars, and Discord as at first"
4592,BOOK V.,"Raging implacable, for them prepared."
4593,BOOK V.,"Ulysses, either Ajax, Diomede—"
4594,BOOK V.,"These roused the Greeks to battle, who themselves"
4595,BOOK V.,"The force fear’d nothing, or the shouts of Troy,620"
4596,BOOK V.,"But steadfast stood, like clouds by Jove amass’d"
4597,BOOK V.,"On lofty mountains, while the fury sleeps"
4598,BOOK V.,"Of Boreas, and of all the stormy winds"
4599,BOOK V.,"Shrill-voiced, that chase the vapors when they blow,"
4600,BOOK V.,"So stood the Greeks, expecting firm the approach625"
4601,BOOK V.,"Of Ilium’s powers, and neither fled nor fear’d."
4602,BOOK V.,Then Agamemnon the embattled host
4603,BOOK V.,"On all sides ranging, cheer’d them. Now, he cried,"
4604,BOOK V.,"Be steadfast, fellow warriors, now be men!"
4605,BOOK V.,Hold fast a sense of honor. More escape630
4606,BOOK V.,"Of men who fear disgrace, than fall in fight,"
4607,BOOK V.,While dastards forfeit life and glory both.
4608,BOOK V.,"He said, and hurl’d his spear. He pierced a friend"
4609,BOOK V.,"Of brave Æneas, warring in the van,"
4610,BOOK V.,"Deicöon son of Pergasus, in Troy635"
4611,BOOK V.,"Not less esteem’d than Priam’s sons themselves,"
4612,BOOK V.,Such was his fame in foremost fight acquired.
4613,BOOK V.,"Him Agamemnon on his buckler smote,"
4614,BOOK V.,"Nor stayed the weapon there, but through his belt"
4615,BOOK V.,"His bowels enter’d, and with hideous clang640"
4616,BOOK V.,And outcry[14] of his batter’d arms he fell.
4617,BOOK V.,"Æneas next two mightiest warriors slew,"
4618,BOOK V.,"Sons of Diocles, of a wealthy sire,"
4619,BOOK V.,"Whose house magnificent in Phæræ stood,"
4620,BOOK V.,Orsilochus and Crethon. Their descent645
4621,BOOK V.,"From broad-stream’d Alpheus, Pylian flood, they drew."
4622,BOOK V.,"Alpheus begat Orsilochus, a prince"
4623,BOOK V.,Of numerous powers. Orsilochus begat
4624,BOOK V.,Warlike Diodes. From Diodes sprang
4625,BOOK V.,"Twins, Crethon and Orsilochus, alike650"
4626,BOOK V.,"Valiant, and skilful in all forms of war."
4627,BOOK V.,"Their boyish prime scarce past, they, with the Greeks"
4628,BOOK V.,"Embarking, in their sable ships had sail’d"
4629,BOOK V.,To steed-fam’d Ilium; just revenge they sought
4630,BOOK V.,"For Atreus’ sons, but perished first themselves.655"
4631,BOOK V.,"As two young lions, in the deep recess"
4632,BOOK V.,Of some dark forest on the mountain’s brow
4633,BOOK V.,"Late nourished by their dam, forth-issuing, seize"
4634,BOOK V.,"The fatted flocks and kine, both folds and stalls"
4635,BOOK V.,"Wasting rapacious, till, at length, themselves660"
4636,BOOK V.,"Deep-wounded perish by the hand of man,"
4637,BOOK V.,"So they, both vanquish’d by Æneas, fell,"
4638,BOOK V.,"And like two lofty pines uprooted, lay."
4639,BOOK V.,Them fallen in battle Menelaus saw
4640,BOOK V.,With pity moved; radiant in arms he shook665
4641,BOOK V.,"His brazen spear, and strode into the van."
4642,BOOK V.,"Mars urged him furious on, conceiving hope"
4643,BOOK V.,Of his death also by Æneas’ hand.
4644,BOOK V.,But him the son of generous Nestor mark’d
4645,BOOK V.,"Antilochus, and to the foremost fight670"
4646,BOOK V.,"Flew also, fearing lest some dire mischance"
4647,BOOK V.,"The Prince befalling, at one fatal stroke"
4648,BOOK V.,Should frustrate all the labors of the Greeks.
4649,BOOK V.,"They, hand to hand, and spear to spear opposed,"
4650,BOOK V.,"Stood threatening dreadful onset, when beside675"
4651,BOOK V.,The Spartan chief Antilochus appear’d.
4652,BOOK V.,"Æneas, at the sight of two combined,"
4653,BOOK V.,"Stood not, although intrepid. They the dead"
4654,BOOK V.,Thence drawing far into the Grecian host
4655,BOOK V.,"To their associates gave the hapless pair,680"
4656,BOOK V.,"Then, both returning, fought in front again."
4657,BOOK V.,"Next, fierce as Mars, Pylæmenes they slew,"
4658,BOOK V.,Prince of the shielded band magnanimous
4659,BOOK V.,Of Paphlagonia. Him Atrides kill’d
4660,BOOK V.,"Spear-practised Menelaus, with a lance685"
4661,BOOK V.,His throat transpiercing while erect he rode.
4662,BOOK V.,"Then, while his charioteer, Mydon the brave,"
4663,BOOK V.,"Son of Atymnias, turn’d his steeds to flight,"
4664,BOOK V.,"Full on his elbow-point Antilochus,"
4665,BOOK V.,"The son of Nestor, dash’d him with a stone.690"
4666,BOOK V.,"The slack reins, white as ivory,[15] forsook"
4667,BOOK V.,His torpid hand and trail’d the dust. At once
4668,BOOK V.,"Forth sprang Antilochus, and with his sword"
4669,BOOK V.,Hew’d deep his temples. On his head he pitch’d
4670,BOOK V.,"Panting, and on his shoulders in the sand695"
4671,BOOK V.,"(For in deep sand he fell) stood long erect,"
4672,BOOK V.,Till his own coursers spread him in the dust;
4673,BOOK V.,"The son of Nestor seized, and with his scourge"
4674,BOOK V.,Drove them afar into the host of Greece.
4675,BOOK V.,"Them Hector through the ranks espying, flew700"
4676,BOOK V.,With clamor loud to meet them; after whom
4677,BOOK V.,"Advanced in phalanx firm the powers of Troy,"
4678,BOOK V.,"Mars led them, with Enyo terror-clad;"
4679,BOOK V.,She by the maddening tumult of the fight
4680,BOOK V.,"Attended, he, with his enormous spear705"
4681,BOOK V.,"in both hands brandish’d, stalking now in front"
4682,BOOK V.,"Of Hector, and now following his steps."
4683,BOOK V.,"Him Diomede the bold discerning, felt"
4684,BOOK V.,Himself no small dismay; and as a man
4685,BOOK V.,"Wandering he knows not whither, far from home,710"
4686,BOOK V.,If chance a rapid torrent to the sea
4687,BOOK V.,"Borne headlong thwart his course, the foaming flood"
4688,BOOK V.,"Obstreperous views awhile, then quick retires,"
4689,BOOK V.,"So he, and his attendants thus bespake."
4690,BOOK V.,"How oft, my countrymen! have we admired715"
4691,BOOK V.,"The noble Hector, skillful at the spear"
4692,BOOK V.,And unappall’d in fight? but still hath he
4693,BOOK V.,"Some God his guard, and even now I view"
4694,BOOK V.,In human form Mars moving at his side.
4695,BOOK V.,"Ye, then, with faces to the Trojans turn’d,720"
4696,BOOK V.,"Ceaseless retire, and war not with the Gods."
4697,BOOK V.,He ended; and the Trojans now approach’d.
4698,BOOK V.,"Then two bold warriors in one chariot borne,"
4699,BOOK V.,"By valiant Hector died, Menesthes one,"
4700,BOOK V.,"And one, Anchialus. Them fallen in fight725"
4701,BOOK V.,"Ajax the vast, touch’d with compassion saw;"
4702,BOOK V.,"Within small space he stood, his glittering spear"
4703,BOOK V.,"Dismiss’d, and pierced Amphius. Son was he"
4704,BOOK V.,"Of Selagus, and Pæsus was his home,"
4705,BOOK V.,"Where opulent he dwelt, but by his fate730"
4706,BOOK V.,Was led to fight for Priam and his sons.
4707,BOOK V.,Him Telamonian Ajax through his belt
4708,BOOK V.,"Wounded, and in his nether bowels deep"
4709,BOOK V.,Fix’d his long-shadow’d spear. Sounding he fell.
4710,BOOK V.,Illustrious Ajax running to the slain735
4711,BOOK V.,"Prepared to strip his arms, but him a shower"
4712,BOOK V.,Of glittering-weapons keen from Trojan hands
4713,BOOK V.,"Assail’d, and numerous his broad shield received."
4714,BOOK V.,"He, on the body planting firm his heel,"
4715,BOOK V.,"Forth drew the polish’d spear, but his bright arms740"
4716,BOOK V.,"Took not, by darts thick-flying sore annoy’d,"
4717,BOOK V.,"Nor fear’d he little lest his haughty foes,"
4718,BOOK V.,"Spear-arm’d and bold, should compass him around;"
4719,BOOK V.,"Him, therefore, valiant though he were and huge,"
4720,BOOK V.,They push’d before them. Staggering he retired.745
4721,BOOK V.,Thus toil’d both hosts in that laborious field.
4722,BOOK V.,And now his ruthless destiny impell’d
4723,BOOK V.,"Tlepolemus, Alcides’ son, a Chief"
4724,BOOK V.,"Dauntless and huge, against a godlike foe"
4725,BOOK V.,Sarpedon. They approaching face to face750
4726,BOOK V.,"Stood, son and grandson of high-thundering Jove,"
4727,BOOK V.,"And, haughty, thus Tlepolemus began."
4728,BOOK V.,"Sarpedon, leader of the Lycian host,"
4729,BOOK V.,Thou trembler! thee what cause could hither urge
4730,BOOK V.,A man unskill’d in arms? They falsely speak755
4731,BOOK V.,"Who call thee son of Ægis-bearing Jove,"
4732,BOOK V.,So far below their might thou fall’st who sprang
4733,BOOK V.,From Jove in days of old. What says report
4734,BOOK V.,Of Hercules (for him I boast my sire)
4735,BOOK V.,All-daring hero with a lion’s heart?760
4736,BOOK V.,"With six ships only, and with followers few,"
4737,BOOK V.,He for the horses of Laomedon
4738,BOOK V.,"Lay’d Troy in dust, and widow’d all her streets."
4739,BOOK V.,"But thou art base, and thy diminish’d powers"
4740,BOOK V.,Perish around thee; think not that thou earnest765
4741,BOOK V.,"For Ilium’s good, but rather, whatsoe’er"
4742,BOOK V.,"Thy force in fight, to find, subdued by me,"
4743,BOOK V.,A sure dismission to the gates of hell.
4744,BOOK V.,To whom the leader of the Lycian band.
4745,BOOK V.,"Tlepolemus! he ransack’d sacred Troy,770"
4746,BOOK V.,"As thou hast said, but for her monarch’s fault"
4747,BOOK V.,"Laomedon, who him with language harsh"
4748,BOOK V.,"Requited ill for benefits received,"
4749,BOOK V.,"Nor would the steeds surrender, seeking which"
4750,BOOK V.,He voyaged from afar. But thou shalt take775
4751,BOOK V.,"Thy bloody doom from this victorious arm,"
4752,BOOK V.,"And, vanquish’d by my spear, shalt yield thy fame"
4753,BOOK V.,"To me, thy soul to Pluto steed-renown’d."
4754,BOOK V.,"So spake Sarpedon, and his ashen beam"
4755,BOOK V.,Tlepolemus upraised. Both hurl’d at once780
4756,BOOK V.,Their quivering spears. Sarpedon’s through the neck
4757,BOOK V.,"Pass’d of Tlepolemus, and show’d beyond"
4758,BOOK V.,Its ruthless point; thick darkness veil’d his eyes.
4759,BOOK V.,Tlepolemus with his long lance the thigh
4760,BOOK V.,Pierced of Sarpedon; sheer into his bone785
4761,BOOK V.,"He pierced him, but Sarpedon’s father, Jove,"
4762,BOOK V.,Him rescued even on the verge of fate.
4763,BOOK V.,His noble friends conducted from the field
4764,BOOK V.,"The godlike Lycian, trailing as he went"
4765,BOOK V.,"The pendent spear, none thinking to extract790"
4766,BOOK V.,"For his relief the weapon from his thigh,"
4767,BOOK V.,Through eagerness of haste to bear him thence.
4768,BOOK V.,"On the other side, the Grecians brazen-mail’d"
4769,BOOK V.,Bore off Tlepolemus. Ulysses fill’d
4770,BOOK V.,"With earnest thoughts tumultuous them observed,795"
4771,BOOK V.,Danger-defying Chief! Doubtful he stood
4772,BOOK V.,Or to pursue at once the Thunderer’s son
4773,BOOK V.,"Sarpedon, or to take more Lycian lives."
4774,BOOK V.,But not for brave Ulysses had his fate
4775,BOOK V.,"That praise reserved, that he should slay the son800"
4776,BOOK V.,Renown’d of Jove; therefore his wavering mind
4777,BOOK V.,Minerva bent against the Lycian band.
4778,BOOK V.,"Then Cœranus, Alastor, Chromius fell,"
4779,BOOK V.,"Alcander, Halius, Prytanis, and brave"
4780,BOOK V.,Noëmon; nor had these sufficed the Chief805
4781,BOOK V.,"Of Ithaca, but Lycians more had fallen,"
4782,BOOK V.,Had not crest-tossing Hector huge perceived
4783,BOOK V.,"The havoc; radiant to the van he flew,"
4784,BOOK V.,Filling with dread the Grecians; his approach
4785,BOOK V.,"Sarpedon, son of Jove, joyful beheld,810"
4786,BOOK V.,And piteous thus address’d him as he came.
4787,BOOK V.,"Ah, leave not me, Priamides! a prey"
4788,BOOK V.,"To Grecian hands, but in your city, at least,"
4789,BOOK V.,"Grant me to die: since hither, doom’d, I came"
4790,BOOK V.,Never to gratify with my return815
4791,BOOK V.,"To Lycia, my loved spouse, or infant child."
4792,BOOK V.,He spake; but Hector unreplying pass’d
4793,BOOK V.,"Impetuous, ardent to repulse the Greeks"
4794,BOOK V.,"That moment, and to drench his sword in blood."
4795,BOOK V.,"Then, under shelter of a spreading beech820"
4796,BOOK V.,"Sacred to Jove, his noble followers placed"
4797,BOOK V.,"The godlike Chief Sarpedon, where his friend"
4798,BOOK V.,"Illustrious Pelagon, the ashen spear"
4799,BOOK V.,"Extracted. Sightless, of all thought bereft,"
4800,BOOK V.,"He sank, but soon revived, by breathing airs825"
4801,BOOK V.,"Refresh’d, that fann’d him gently from the North."
4802,BOOK V.,"Meantime the Argives, although press’d alike"
4803,BOOK V.,"By Mars himself and Hector brazen-arm’d,"
4804,BOOK V.,"Neither to flight inclined, nor yet advanced"
4805,BOOK V.,"To battle, but inform’d that Mars the fight830"
4806,BOOK V.,"Waged on the side of Ilium, slow retired.[16]"
4807,BOOK V.,"Whom first, whom last slew then the mighty son"
4808,BOOK V.,"Of Priam, Hector, and the brazen Mars!"
4809,BOOK V.,"First godlike Teuthras, an equestrian Chief,"
4810,BOOK V.,"Orestes, Trechus of Ætolian race,835"
4811,BOOK V.,"Œnomaüs, Helenus from Œnops’ sprung,"
4812,BOOK V.,"And brisk[17] in fight Oresbius; rich was he,"
4813,BOOK V.,And covetous of more; in Hyla dwelt
4814,BOOK V.,"Fast by the lake Cephissus, where abode"
4815,BOOK V.,"Bœotian Princes numerous, rich themselves840"
4816,BOOK V.,And rulers of a people wealth-renown’d.
4817,BOOK V.,"But Juno, such dread slaughter of the Greeks"
4818,BOOK V.,"Noting, thus, ardent, to Minerva spake."
4819,BOOK V.,Daughter of Jove invincible! Our word
4820,BOOK V.,"That Troy shall perish, hath been given in vain845"
4821,BOOK V.,"To Menelaus, if we suffer Mars"
4822,BOOK V.,To ravage longer uncontrol’d. The time
4823,BOOK V.,"Urges, and need appears that we ourselves"
4824,BOOK V.,Now call to mind the fury of our might.
4825,BOOK V.,She spake; nor blue-eyed Pallas not complied.850
4826,BOOK V.,"Then Juno, Goddess dread, from Saturn sprung,"
4827,BOOK V.,Her coursers gold-caparison’d prepared
4828,BOOK V.,Impatient. Hebe to the chariot roll’d
4829,BOOK V.,"The brazen wheels,[18] and joined them to the smooth"
4830,BOOK V.,Steel axle; twice four spokes divided each855
4831,BOOK V.,Shot from the centre to the verge. The verge
4832,BOOK V.,Was gold by fellies of eternal brass
4833,BOOK V.,"Guarded, a dazzling show! The shining naves"
4834,BOOK V.,Were silver; silver cords and cords of gold
4835,BOOK V.,The seat upbore; two crescents[19] blazed in front.860
4836,BOOK V.,"The pole was argent all, to which she bound"
4837,BOOK V.,"The golden yoke, and in their place disposed"
4838,BOOK V.,The breast-bands incorruptible of gold;
4839,BOOK V.,"But Juno to the yoke, herself, the steeds"
4840,BOOK V.,"Led forth, on fire to reach the dreadful field.865"
4841,BOOK V.,"Meantime, Minerva, progeny of Jove,"
4842,BOOK V.,On the adamantine floor of his abode
4843,BOOK V.,"Let fall profuse her variegated robe,"
4844,BOOK V.,Labor of her own hands. She first put on
4845,BOOK V.,"The corselet of the cloud-assembler God,870"
4846,BOOK V.,Then arm’d her for the field of wo complete.
4847,BOOK V.,She charged her shoulder with the dreadful shield
4848,BOOK V.,"The shaggy Ægis,[20] border’d thick around"
4849,BOOK V.,"With terror; there was Discord, Prowess there,"
4850,BOOK V.,"There hot Pursuit, and there the feature grim875"
4851,BOOK V.,"Of Gorgon, dire Deformity, a sign"
4852,BOOK V.,Oft borne portentous on the arm of Jove.
4853,BOOK V.,"Her golden helm, whose concave had sufficed"
4854,BOOK V.,"The legions of an hundred cities, rough"
4855,BOOK V.,"With warlike ornament superb, she fix’d880"
4856,BOOK V.,"On her immortal head. Thus arm’d, she rose"
4857,BOOK V.,"Into the flaming chariot, and her spear"
4858,BOOK V.,"Seized ponderous, huge, with which the Goddess sprung"
4859,BOOK V.,"From an Almighty father, levels ranks"
4860,BOOK V.,"Of heroes, against whom her anger burns.885"
4861,BOOK V.,Juno with lifted lash urged quick the steeds;
4862,BOOK V.,"At her approach, spontaneous roar’d the wide-"
4863,BOOK V.,Unfolding gates of heaven;[21] the heavenly gates
4864,BOOK V.,"Kept by the watchful Hours, to whom the charge"
4865,BOOK V.,"Of the Olympian summit appertains,890"
4866,BOOK V.,"And of the boundless ether, back to roll,"
4867,BOOK V.,And to replace the cloudy barrier dense.
4868,BOOK V.,Spurr’d through the portal flew the rapid steeds;
4869,BOOK V.,"Apart from all, and seated on the point"
4870,BOOK V.,"Superior of the cloven mount, they found895"
4871,BOOK V.,The Thunderer. Juno the white-arm’d her steeds
4872,BOOK V.,"There stay’d, and thus the Goddess, ere she pass’d,"
4873,BOOK V.,"Question’d the son of Saturn, Jove supreme."
4874,BOOK V.,"Jove, Father, seest thou, and art not incensed,"
4875,BOOK V.,"These ravages of Mars? Oh what a field,900"
4876,BOOK V.,"Drench’d with what Grecian blood! All rashly spilt,"
4877,BOOK V.,"And in despite of me. Venus, the while,"
4878,BOOK V.,"Sits, and the Archer of the silver bow"
4879,BOOK V.,"Delighted, and have urged, themselves, to this"
4880,BOOK V.,The frantic Mars within no bounds confined905
4881,BOOK V.,"Of law or order. But, eternal sire!"
4882,BOOK V.,Shall I offend thee chasing far away
4883,BOOK V.,Mars deeply smitten from the field of war?
4884,BOOK V.,To whom the cloud-assembler God replied.
4885,BOOK V.,Go! but exhort thou rather to the task910
4886,BOOK V.,"Spoil-huntress Athenæan Pallas, him"
4887,BOOK V.,Accustom’d to chastise with pain severe.
4888,BOOK V.,"He spake, nor white-arm’d Juno not obey’d."
4889,BOOK V.,She lash’d her steeds; they readily their flight
4890,BOOK V.,"Began, the earth and starry vault between.915"
4891,BOOK V.,Far as from his high tower the watchman kens
4892,BOOK V.,"O’er gloomy ocean, so far at one bound"
4893,BOOK V.,Advance the shrill-voiced coursers of the Gods.
4894,BOOK V.,But when at Troy and at the confluent streams
4895,BOOK V.,"Of Simoïs and Scamander they arrived,920"
4896,BOOK V.,"There Juno, white-arm’d Goddess, from the yoke"
4897,BOOK V.,"Her steeds releasing, them in gather’d shades"
4898,BOOK V.,"Conceal’d opaque, while Simoïs caused to spring"
4899,BOOK V.,"Ambrosia from his bank, whereon they browsed."
4900,BOOK V.,Swift as her pinions waft the dove away925
4901,BOOK V.,"They sought the Grecians, ardent to begin:"
4902,BOOK V.,Arriving where the mightiest and the most
4903,BOOK V.,"Compass’d equestrian Diomede around,"
4904,BOOK V.,"In aspect lion-like, or like wild boars"
4905,BOOK V.,"Of matchless force, there white-arm’d Juno stood,930"
4906,BOOK V.,And in the form of Stentor for his voice
4907,BOOK V.,"Of brass renown’d, audible as the roar"
4908,BOOK V.,"Of fifty throats, the Grecians thus harangued."
4909,BOOK V.,"Oh shame, shame, shame! Argives in form alone,"
4910,BOOK V.,Beautiful but dishonorable race!935
4911,BOOK V.,"While yet divine Achilles ranged the field,"
4912,BOOK V.,No Trojan stepp’d from yon Dardanian gates
4913,BOOK V.,Abroad; all trembled at his stormy spear;
4914,BOOK V.,"But now they venture forth, now at your ships"
4915,BOOK V.,"Defy you, from their city far remote.940"
4916,BOOK V.,"She ceased, and all caught courage from the sound."
4917,BOOK V.,But Athenæan Pallas eager sought
4918,BOOK V.,The son of Tydeus; at his chariot side
4919,BOOK V.,She found the Chief cooling his fiery wound
4920,BOOK V.,Received from Pandarus; for him the sweat945
4921,BOOK V.,Beneath the broad band of his oval shield
4922,BOOK V.,"Exhausted, and his arm fail’d him fatigued;"
4923,BOOK V.,He therefore raised the band and wiped the blood
4924,BOOK V.,Coagulate; when o’er his chariot yoke
4925,BOOK V.,"Her arm the Goddess threw, and thus began.950"
4926,BOOK V.,"Tydeus, in truth, begat a son himself"
4927,BOOK V.,Not much resembling. Tydeus was of size
4928,BOOK V.,"Diminutive, but had a warrior’s heart."
4929,BOOK V.,When him I once commanded to abstain
4930,BOOK V.,From furious fight (what time he enter’d Thebes955
4931,BOOK V.,"Ambassador, and the Cadmeans found"
4932,BOOK V.,"Feasting, himself the sole Achaian there)"
4933,BOOK V.,And bade him quietly partake the feast.
4934,BOOK V.,"He, fired with wonted ardor, challenged forth"
4935,BOOK V.,"To proof of manhood the Cadmean youth,960"
4936,BOOK V.,"Whom easily, through my effectual aid,"
4937,BOOK V.,In contests of each kind he overcame.
4938,BOOK V.,"But thou, whom I encircle with my power,"
4939,BOOK V.,"Guard vigilant, and even bid thee forth"
4940,BOOK V.,"To combat with the Trojans, thou, thy limbs965"
4941,BOOK V.,"Feel’st wearied with the toils of war, or worse,"
4942,BOOK V.,Indulgest womanish and heartless fear.
4943,BOOK V.,Henceforth thou art not worthy to be deem’d
4944,BOOK V.,"Son of Oenides, Tydeus famed in arms."
4945,BOOK V.,To whom thus valiant Diomede replied.970
4946,BOOK V.,"I know thee well, oh Goddess sprung from Jove!"
4947,BOOK V.,"And therefore willing shall, and plain, reply."
4948,BOOK V.,Me neither weariness nor heartless fear
4949,BOOK V.,"Restrains, but thine injunctions which impress"
4950,BOOK V.,"My memory, still, that I should fear to oppose975"
4951,BOOK V.,"The blessed Gods in fight, Venus except,"
4952,BOOK V.,Whom in the battle found thou badest me pierce
4953,BOOK V.,With unrelenting spear; therefore myself
4954,BOOK V.,"Retiring hither, I have hither call’d"
4955,BOOK V.,"The other Argives also, for I know980"
4956,BOOK V.,"That Mars, himself in arms, controls the war."
4957,BOOK V.,Him answer’d then the Goddess azure-eyed.
4958,BOOK V.,"Tydides! Diomede, my heart’s delight!"
4959,BOOK V.,"Fear not this Mars,[22] nor fear thou other power"
4960,BOOK V.,"Immortal, but be confident in me.985"
4961,BOOK V.,Arise. Drive forth. Seek Mars; him only seek;
4962,BOOK V.,Him hand to hand engage; this fiery Mars
4963,BOOK V.,"Respect not aught, base implement of wrong"
4964,BOOK V.,"And mischief, shifting still from side to side."
4965,BOOK V.,He promised Juno lately and myself990
4966,BOOK V.,"That he would fight for Greece, yet now forgets"
4967,BOOK V.,"His promise, and gives all his aid to Troy."
4968,BOOK V.,"So saying, she backward by his hand withdrew"
4969,BOOK V.,"The son of Capaneus, who to the ground"
4970,BOOK V.,"Leap’d instant; she, impatient to his place995"
4971,BOOK V.,"Ascending, sat beside brave Diomede."
4972,BOOK V.,"Loud groan’d the beechen axle, under weight"
4973,BOOK V.,"Unwonted, for it bore into the fight"
4974,BOOK V.,"An awful Goddess, and the chief of men."
4975,BOOK V.,Quick-seizing lash and reins Minerva drove1000
4976,BOOK V.,Direct at Mars. That moment he had slain
4977,BOOK V.,"Periphas, bravest of Ætolia’s sons,"
4978,BOOK V.,And huge of bulk; Ochesius was his sire.
4979,BOOK V.,Him Mars the slaughterer had of life bereft
4980,BOOK V.,"Newly, and Pallas to elude his sight1005"
4981,BOOK V.,The helmet fixed of Ades on her head.[23]
4982,BOOK V.,Soon as gore-tainted Mars the approach perceived
4983,BOOK V.,"Of Diomede, he left the giant length"
4984,BOOK V.,"Of Periphas extended where he died,"
4985,BOOK V.,And flew to cope with Tydeus’ valiant son.1010
4986,BOOK V.,"Full nigh they came, when Mars on fire to slay"
4987,BOOK V.,"The hero, foremost with his brazen lance"
4988,BOOK V.,"Assail’d him, hurling o’er his horses’ heads."
4989,BOOK V.,But Athenæan Pallas in her hand
4990,BOOK V.,"The flying weapon caught and turn’d it wide,1015"
4991,BOOK V.,Baffling his aim. Then Diomede on him
4992,BOOK V.,"Rush’d furious in his turn, and Pallas plunged"
4993,BOOK V.,The bright spear deep into his cinctured waist
4994,BOOK V.,"Dire was the wound, and plucking back the spear"
4995,BOOK V.,She tore him. Bellow’d brazen-throated Mars1020
4996,BOOK V.,"Loud as nine thousand warriors, or as ten"
4997,BOOK V.,"Join’d in close combat. Grecians, Trojans shook"
4998,BOOK V.,Appall’d alike at the tremendous voice
4999,BOOK V.,Of Mars insatiable with deeds of blood.
5000,BOOK V.,Such as the dimness is when summer winds1025
5001,BOOK V.,"Breathe hot, and sultry mist obscures the sky,"
5002,BOOK V.,Such brazen Mars to Diomede appear’d
5003,BOOK V.,By clouds accompanied in his ascent
5004,BOOK V.,Into the boundless ether. Reaching soon
5005,BOOK V.,"The Olympian heights, seat of the Gods, he sat1030"
5006,BOOK V.,Beside Saturnian Jove; wo fill’d his heart;
5007,BOOK V.,He show’d fast-streaming from the wound his blood
5008,BOOK V.,"Immortal, and impatient thus complain’d."
5009,BOOK V.,"Jove, Father! Seest thou these outrageous acts"
5010,BOOK V.,Unmoved with anger? Such are day by day1035
5011,BOOK V.,The dreadful mischiefs by the Gods contrived
5012,BOOK V.,"Against each other, for the sake of man."
5013,BOOK V.,Thou art thyself the cause. Thou hast produced
5014,BOOK V.,"A foolish daughter petulant, addict"
5015,BOOK V.,To evil only and injurious deeds;1040
5016,BOOK V.,"There is not in Olympus, save herself,"
5017,BOOK V.,Who feels not thy control; but she her will
5018,BOOK V.,"Gratifies ever, and reproof from thee"
5019,BOOK V.,"Finds none, because, pernicious as she is,"
5020,BOOK V.,She is thy daughter. She hath now the mind1045
5021,BOOK V.,Of haughty Diomede with madness fill’d
5022,BOOK V.,Against the immortal Gods; first Venus bled;
5023,BOOK V.,"Her hand he pierced impetuous, then assail’d,"
5024,BOOK V.,"As if himself immortal, even me,"
5025,BOOK V.,"But me my feet stole thence, or overwhelm’d1050"
5026,BOOK V.,"Beneath yon heaps of carcases impure,"
5027,BOOK V.,What had I not sustain’d? And if at last
5028,BOOK V.,"I lived, had halted crippled by the sword."
5029,BOOK V.,To whom with dark displeasure Jove replied.
5030,BOOK V.,Base and side-shifting traitor! vex not me1055
5031,BOOK V.,Here sitting querulous; of all who dwell
5032,BOOK V.,"On the Olympian heights, thee most I hate"
5033,BOOK V.,"Contentious, whose delight is war alone."
5034,BOOK V.,"Thou hast thy mother’s moods, the very spleen"
5035,BOOK V.,"Of Juno, uncontrolable as she.1060"
5036,BOOK V.,"Whom even I, reprove her as I may,"
5037,BOOK V.,Scarce rule by mere commands; I therefore judge
5038,BOOK V.,Thy sufferings a contrivance all her own.
5039,BOOK V.,But soft. Thou art my son whom I begat.
5040,BOOK V.,And Juno bare thee. I can not endure1065
5041,BOOK V.,That thou shouldst suffer long. Hadst thou been born
5042,BOOK V.,"Of other parents thus detestable,"
5043,BOOK V.,"What Deity soe’er had brought thee forth,"
5044,BOOK V.,Thou shouldst have found long since a humbler sphere.
5045,BOOK V.,"He ceased, and to the care his son consign’d1070"
5046,BOOK V.,"Of Pæon; he with drugs of lenient powers,"
5047,BOOK V.,Soon heal’d whom immortality secured
5048,BOOK V.,From dissolution. As the juice from figs
5049,BOOK V.,Express’d what fluid was in milk before
5050,BOOK V.,"Coagulates, stirr’d rapidly around,1075"
5051,BOOK V.,So soon was Mars by Pæon skill restored.
5052,BOOK V.,"Him Hebe bathed, and with divine attire"
5053,BOOK V.,Graceful adorn’d; when at the side of Jove
5054,BOOK V.,Again his glorious seat sublime he took.
5055,BOOK V.,Meantime to the abode of Jove supreme1080
5056,BOOK V.,Ascended Juno throughout Argos known
5057,BOOK V.,"And mighty Pallas; Mars the plague of man,"
5058,BOOK V.,By their successful force from slaughter driven.

5094,BOOK VI.,"But Diomede, heroic Chief, the son"
5095,BOOK VI.,"Of Teuthras slew, Axylus.[3] Rich was he,15"
5096,BOOK VI.,And in Arisba (where he dwelt beside
5097,BOOK VI.,"The public road, and at his open door"
5098,BOOK VI.,Made welcome all) respected and beloved.
5099,BOOK VI.,But of his numerous guests none interposed
5100,BOOK VI.,To avert his woful doom; nor him alone20
5101,BOOK VI.,"He slew, but with him also to the shades"
5102,BOOK VI.,"Calesius sent, his friend and charioteer."
5103,BOOK VI.,"Opheltius fell and Dresus, by the hand"
5104,BOOK VI.,"Slain of Euryalus, who, next, his arms"
5105,BOOK VI.,On Pedasus and on Æsepus turned25
5106,BOOK VI.,"Brethren and twins. Them Abarbarea bore,"
5107,BOOK VI.,"A Naiad, to Bucolion, son renown’d"
5108,BOOK VI.,"Of King Laomedon, his eldest born,"
5109,BOOK VI.,"But by his mother, at his birth, conceal’d."
5110,BOOK VI.,"Bucolion pasturing his flocks, embraced30"
5111,BOOK VI.,"The lovely nymph; she twins produced, both whom,"
5112,BOOK VI.,"Brave as they were and beautiful, thy son[4]"
5113,BOOK VI.,"Mecisteus! slew, and from their shoulders tore"
5114,BOOK VI.,Their armor. Dauntless Polypœtes slew
5115,BOOK VI.,Astyalus. Ulysses with his spear35
5116,BOOK VI.,"Transfixed Pydites, a Percosian Chief,"
5117,BOOK VI.,And Teucer Aretaön; Nestor’s pride
5118,BOOK VI.,"Antilochus, with his bright lance, of life"
5119,BOOK VI.,"Bereft Ablerus, and the royal arm"
5120,BOOK VI.,"Of Agamemnon, Elatus; he dwelt40"
5121,BOOK VI.,"Among the hills of lofty Pedasus,"
5122,BOOK VI.,"On Satnio’s banks, smooth-sliding river pure"
5123,BOOK VI.,"Phylacus fled, whom Leïtus as swift"
5124,BOOK VI.,Soon smote. Melanthius at the feet expired
5125,BOOK VI.,"Of the renown’d Eurypylus, and, flush’d45"
5126,BOOK VI.,"With martial ardor, Menelaus seized"
5127,BOOK VI.,And took alive Adrastus. As it chanced
5128,BOOK VI.,A thicket his affrighted steeds detain’d
5129,BOOK VI.,Their feet entangling; they with restive force
5130,BOOK VI.,"At its extremity snapp’d short the pole,50"
5131,BOOK VI.,"And to the city, whither others fled,"
5132,BOOK VI.,"Fled also. From his chariot headlong hurl’d,"
5133,BOOK VI.,Adrastus press’d the plain fast by his wheel.
5134,BOOK VI.,"Flew Menelaus, and his quivering spear"
5135,BOOK VI.,"Shook over him; he, life imploring, clasp’d55"
5136,BOOK VI.,"Importunate his knees, and thus exclaim’d."
5137,BOOK VI.,"Oh, son of Atreus, let me live! accept"
5138,BOOK VI.,Illustrious ransom! In my father’s house
5139,BOOK VI.,"Is wealth abundant, gold, and brass, and steel"
5140,BOOK VI.,"Of truest temper, which he will impart60"
5141,BOOK VI.,"Till he have gratified thine utmost wish,"
5142,BOOK VI.,Inform’d that I am captive in your fleet.
5143,BOOK VI.,"He said, and Menelaus by his words"
5144,BOOK VI.,"Vanquish’d, him soon had to the fleet dismiss’d"
5145,BOOK VI.,"Given to his train in charge, but swift and stern65"
5146,BOOK VI.,"Approaching, Agamemnon interposed."
5147,BOOK VI.,"Now, brother, whence this milkiness of mind,"
5148,BOOK VI.,These scruples about blood? Thy Trojan friends
5149,BOOK VI.,Have doubtless much obliged thee. Die the race!
5150,BOOK VI.,"May none escape us! neither he who flies,70"
5151,BOOK VI.,Nor even the infant in his mother’s womb
5152,BOOK VI.,Unconscious. Perish universal Troy
5153,BOOK VI.,"Unpitied, till her place be found no more![5]"
5154,BOOK VI.,"So saying, his brother’s mind the Hero turn’d,"
5155,BOOK VI.,Advising him aright; he with his hand75
5156,BOOK VI.,"Thrust back Adrastus, and himself, the King,"
5157,BOOK VI.,"His bowels pierced. Supine Adrastus fell,"
5158,BOOK VI.,"And Agamemnon, with his foot the corse"
5159,BOOK VI.,"Impressing firm, pluck’d forth his ashen spear."
5160,BOOK VI.,"Then Nestor, raising high his voice, exclaim’d.80"
5161,BOOK VI.,"Friends, Heroes, Grecians, ministers of Mars!"
5162,BOOK VI.,"Let none, desirous of the spoil, his time"
5163,BOOK VI.,"Devote to plunder now; now slay your foes,"
5164,BOOK VI.,And strip them when the field shall be your own.[6]
5165,BOOK VI.,
5166,BOOK VI.,"He said, and all took courage at his word.85"
5167,BOOK VI.,Then had the Trojans enter’d Troy again
5168,BOOK VI.,"By the heroic Grecians foul repulsed,"
5169,BOOK VI.,"So was their spirit daunted, but the son"
5170,BOOK VI.,"Of Priam, Helenus, an augur far"
5171,BOOK VI.,"Excelling all, at Hector’s side his speech90"
5172,BOOK VI.,To him and to Æneas thus address’d.
5173,BOOK VI.,"Hector, and thou, Æneas, since on you"
5174,BOOK VI.,"The Lycians chiefly and ourselves depend,"
5175,BOOK VI.,For that in difficult emprize ye show
5176,BOOK VI.,"Most courage; give best counsel; stand yourselves,95"
5177,BOOK VI.,"And, visiting all quarters, cause to stand"
5178,BOOK VI.,"Before the city-gates our scatter’d troops,"
5179,BOOK VI.,Ere yet the fugitives within the arms
5180,BOOK VI.,"Be slaughter’d of their wives, the scorn of Greece."
5181,BOOK VI.,When thus ye shall have rallied every band100
5182,BOOK VI.,"And roused their courage, weary though we be,"
5183,BOOK VI.,"Yet since necessity commands, even here"
5184,BOOK VI.,Will we give battle to the host of Greece.
5185,BOOK VI.,"But, Hector! to the city thou depart;"
5186,BOOK VI.,"There charge our mother, that she go direct,105"
5187,BOOK VI.,"With the assembled matrons, to the fane"
5188,BOOK VI.,Of Pallas in the citadel of Troy.
5189,BOOK VI.,"Opening her chambers’ sacred doors, of all"
5190,BOOK VI.,"Her treasured mantles there, let her select"
5191,BOOK VI.,"The widest, most magnificently wrought,110"
5192,BOOK VI.,And which she values most; _that_ let her spread
5193,BOOK VI.,On Athenæan Pallas’ lap divine.[7]
5194,BOOK VI.,Twelve heifers of the year yet never touch’d
5195,BOOK VI.,"With puncture of the goad, let her alike"
5196,BOOK VI.,"Devote to her, if she will pity Troy,115"
5197,BOOK VI.,"Our wives and little ones, and will avert"
5198,BOOK VI.,"The son of Tydeus from these sacred towers,"
5199,BOOK VI.,"That dreadful Chief, terror of all our host,"
5200,BOOK VI.,"Bravest, in my account, of all the Greeks."
5201,BOOK VI.,For never yet Achilles hath himself120
5202,BOOK VI.,"So taught our people fear, although esteemed"
5203,BOOK VI.,Son of a Goddess. But this warrior’s rage
5204,BOOK VI.,"Is boundless, and his strength past all compare."
5205,BOOK VI.,So Helenus; nor Hector not complied.
5206,BOOK VI.,Down from his chariot instant to the ground125
5207,BOOK VI.,"All arm’d he leap’d, and, shaking his sharp spears,"
5208,BOOK VI.,"Through every phalanx pass’d, rousing again"
5209,BOOK VI.,"Their courage, and rekindling horrid war."
5210,BOOK VI.,"They, turning, faced the Greeks; the Greeks repulsed,"
5211,BOOK VI.,"Ceased from all carnage, nor supposed they less130"
5212,BOOK VI.,"Than that some Deity, the starry skies"
5213,BOOK VI.,"Forsaken, help’d their foes, so firm they stood."
5214,BOOK VI.,But Hector to the Trojans call’d aloud.
5215,BOOK VI.,Ye dauntless Trojans and confederate powers
5216,BOOK VI.,"Call’d from afar! now be ye men, my friends,135"
5217,BOOK VI.,Now summon all the fury of your might!
5218,BOOK VI.,I go to charge our senators and wives
5219,BOOK VI.,That they address the Gods with prayers and vows
5220,BOOK VI.,"For our success, and hecatombs devote."
5221,BOOK VI.,"So saying the Hero went, and as he strode140"
5222,BOOK VI.,The sable hide that lined his bossy shield
5223,BOOK VI.,Smote on his neck and on his ancle-bone.
5224,BOOK VI.,And now into the middle space between
5225,BOOK VI.,"Both hosts, the son of Tydeus and the son"
5226,BOOK VI.,"Moved of Hippolochus, intent alike145"
5227,BOOK VI.,"On furious combat; face to face they stood,"
5228,BOOK VI.,And thus heroic Diomede began.
5229,BOOK VI.,Most noble Champion! who of human kind
5230,BOOK VI.,"Art thou,[8] whom in the man-ennobling fight"
5231,BOOK VI.,I now encounter first? Past all thy peers150
5232,BOOK VI.,"I must esteem thee valiant, who hast dared"
5233,BOOK VI.,"To meet my coming, and my spear defy."
5234,BOOK VI.,Ah! they are sons of miserable sires
5235,BOOK VI.,Who dare my might; but if a God from heaven
5236,BOOK VI.,"Thou come, behold! I fight not with the Gods.155"
5237,BOOK VI.,"That war Lycurgus son of Dryas waged,"
5238,BOOK VI.,And saw not many years. The nurses he
5239,BOOK VI.,Of brain-disturbing Bacchus down the steep
5240,BOOK VI.,Pursued of sacred Nyssa; they their wands
5241,BOOK VI.,"Vine-wreathed cast all away, with an ox-goad160"
5242,BOOK VI.,Chastised by fell Lycurgus. Bacchus plunged
5243,BOOK VI.,"Meantime dismay’d into the deep, where him"
5244,BOOK VI.,"Trembling, and at the Hero’s haughty threats"
5245,BOOK VI.,"Confounded, Thetis in her bosom hid.[9]"
5246,BOOK VI.,Thus by Lycurgus were the blessed powers165
5247,BOOK VI.,"Of heaven offended, and Saturnian Jove"
5248,BOOK VI.,"Of sight bereaved him, who not long that loss"
5249,BOOK VI.,"Survived, for he was curst by all above."
5250,BOOK VI.,"I, therefore, wage no contest with the Gods;"
5251,BOOK VI.,"But if thou be of men, and feed on bread170"
5252,BOOK VI.,"Of earthly growth, draw nigh, that with a stroke"
5253,BOOK VI.,"Well-aim’d, I may at once cut short thy days.[10]"
5254,BOOK VI.,To whom the illustrious Lycian Chief replied.
5255,BOOK VI.,Why asks brave Diomede of my descent?
5256,BOOK VI.,"For, as the leaves, such is the race of man.[11]175"
5257,BOOK VI.,"The wind shakes down the leaves, the budding grove"
5258,BOOK VI.,"Soon teems with others, and in spring they grow."
5259,BOOK VI.,So pass mankind. One generation meets
5260,BOOK VI.,"Its destined period, and a new succeeds."
5261,BOOK VI.,But since thou seem’st desirous to be taught180
5262,BOOK VI.,"My pedigree, whereof no few have heard,"
5263,BOOK VI.,"Know that in Argos, in the very lap"
5264,BOOK VI.,"Of Argos, for her steed-grazed meadows famed,"
5265,BOOK VI.,"Stands Ephyra;[12] there Sisyphus abode,"
5266,BOOK VI.,"Shrewdest of human kind; Sisyphus, named185"
5267,BOOK VI.,"Æolides. Himself a son begat,"
5268,BOOK VI.,"Glaucus, and he Bellerophon, to whom"
5269,BOOK VI.,The Gods both manly force and beauty gave.
5270,BOOK VI.,Him Prœtus (for in Argos at that time
5271,BOOK VI.,"Prœtus was sovereign, to whose sceptre Jove190"
5272,BOOK VI.,"Had subjected the land) plotting his death,"
5273,BOOK VI.,Contrived to banish from his native home.
5274,BOOK VI.,"For fair Anteia, wife of Prœtus, mad"
5275,BOOK VI.,"Through love of young Bellerophon, him oft"
5276,BOOK VI.,In secret to illicit joys enticed;195
5277,BOOK VI.,But she prevail’d not o’er the virtuous mind
5278,BOOK VI.,Discrete of whom she wooed; therefore a lie
5279,BOOK VI.,"Framing, she royal Prœtus thus bespake."
5280,BOOK VI.,"Die thou, or slay Bellerophon, who sought"
5281,BOOK VI.,Of late to force me to his lewd embrace.200
5282,BOOK VI.,"So saying, the anger of the King she roused."
5283,BOOK VI.,"Slay him himself he would not, for his heart"
5284,BOOK VI.,Forbad the deed; him therefore he dismiss’d
5285,BOOK VI.,"To Lycia, charged with tales of dire import"
5286,BOOK VI.,"Written in tablets,[13] which he bade him show,205"
5287,BOOK VI.,"That he might perish, to Anteia’s sire."
5288,BOOK VI.,"To Lycia then, conducted by the Gods,"
5289,BOOK VI.,"He went, and on the shores of Xanthus found"
5290,BOOK VI.,Free entertainment noble at the hands
5291,BOOK VI.,Of Lycia’s potent King. Nine days complete210
5292,BOOK VI.,"He feasted him, and slew each day an ox."
5293,BOOK VI.,"But when the tenth day’s ruddy morn appear’d,"
5294,BOOK VI.,"He asked him then his errand, and to see"
5295,BOOK VI.,Those written tablets from his son-in-law.
5296,BOOK VI.,"The letters seen, he bade him, first, destroy215"
5297,BOOK VI.,"Chimæra, deem’d invincible, divine"
5298,BOOK VI.,"In nature, alien from the race of man,"
5299,BOOK VI.,"Lion in front, but dragon all behind,"
5300,BOOK VI.,And in the midst a she-goat breathing forth
5301,BOOK VI.,Profuse the violence of flaming fire.220
5302,BOOK VI.,"Her, confident in signs from heaven, he slew."
5303,BOOK VI.,"Next, with the men of Solymæ[14] he fought,"
5304,BOOK VI.,"Brave warriors far renown’d, with whom he waged,"
5305,BOOK VI.,"In his account, the fiercest of his wars."
5306,BOOK VI.,"And lastly, when in battle he had slain225"
5307,BOOK VI.,"The man-resisting Amazons, the king"
5308,BOOK VI.,Another stratagem at his return
5309,BOOK VI.,"Devised against him, placing close-conceal’d"
5310,BOOK VI.,An ambush for him from the bravest chosen
5311,BOOK VI.,In Lycia; but they saw their homes no more;230
5312,BOOK VI.,Bellerophon the valiant slew them all.
5313,BOOK VI.,"The monarch hence collecting, at the last,"
5314,BOOK VI.,"His heavenly origin, him there detain’d,"
5315,BOOK VI.,"And gave him his own daughter, with the half"
5316,BOOK VI.,Of all his royal dignity and power.235
5317,BOOK VI.,"The Lycians also, for his proper use,"
5318,BOOK VI.,"Large lot assigned him of their richest soil,[15]"
5319,BOOK VI.,"Commodious for the vine, or for the plow."
5320,BOOK VI.,And now his consort fair three children bore
5321,BOOK VI.,"To bold Bellerophon; Isandrus one,240"
5322,BOOK VI.,"And one, Hippolochus; his youngest born"
5323,BOOK VI.,Laodamia was for beauty such
5324,BOOK VI.,That she became a concubine of Jove.
5325,BOOK VI.,She bore Sarpedon of heroic note.
5326,BOOK VI.,"But when Bellerophon, at last, himself245"
5327,BOOK VI.,"Had anger’d all the Gods, feeding on grief"
5328,BOOK VI.,"He roam’d alone the Aleian field, exiled,"
5329,BOOK VI.,"By choice, from every cheerful haunt of man."
5330,BOOK VI.,"Mars, thirsty still for blood, his son destroy’d"
5331,BOOK VI.,"Isandrus, warring with the host renown’d250"
5332,BOOK VI.,Of Solymæ; and in her wrath divine
5333,BOOK VI.,Diana from her chariot golden-rein’d
5334,BOOK VI.,Laodamia slew. Myself I boast
5335,BOOK VI.,Sprung from Hippolochus; he sent me forth
5336,BOOK VI.,"To fight for Troy, charging me much and oft255"
5337,BOOK VI.,That I should outstrip always all mankind
5338,BOOK VI.,"In worth and valor, nor the house disgrace"
5339,BOOK VI.,"Of my forefathers, heroes without peer"
5340,BOOK VI.,"In Ephyra, and in Lycia’s wide domain."
5341,BOOK VI.,Such is my lineage; such the blood I boast.260
5342,BOOK VI.,He ceased. Then valiant Diomede rejoiced.
5343,BOOK VI.,"He pitch’d his spear, and to the Lycian Prince"
5344,BOOK VI.,In terms of peace and amity replied.
5345,BOOK VI.,"Thou art my own hereditary friend,"
5346,BOOK VI.,Whose noble grandsire was the guest of mine.[16]265
5347,BOOK VI.,"For Oeneus, on a time, full twenty days"
5348,BOOK VI.,"Regaled Bellerophon, and pledges fair"
5349,BOOK VI.,Of hospitality they interchanged.
5350,BOOK VI.,Oeneus a belt radiant with purple gave
5351,BOOK VI.,"To brave Bellerophon, who in return270"
5352,BOOK VI.,Gave him a golden goblet. Coming forth
5353,BOOK VI.,I left the kind memorial safe at home.
5354,BOOK VI.,"A child was I when Tydeus went to Thebes,"
5355,BOOK VI.,"Where the Achaians perish’d, and of him"
5356,BOOK VI.,"Hold no remembrance; but henceforth, my friend,275"
5357,BOOK VI.,"Thine host am I in Argos, and thou mine"
5358,BOOK VI.,"In Lycia, should I chance to sojourn there."
5359,BOOK VI.,We will not clash. Trojans or aids of Troy
5360,BOOK VI.,"No few the Gods shall furnish to my spear,"
5361,BOOK VI.,Whom I may slaughter; and no want of Greeks280
5362,BOOK VI.,"On whom to prove thy prowess, thou shalt find."
5363,BOOK VI.,But it were well that an exchange ensued
5364,BOOK VI.,"Between us; take mine armor, give me thine,"
5365,BOOK VI.,That all who notice us may understand
5366,BOOK VI.,Our patrimonial[17] amity and love.285
5367,BOOK VI.,"So they, and each alighting, hand in hand"
5368,BOOK VI.,"Stood lock’d, faith promising and firm accord."
5369,BOOK VI.,Then Jove of sober judgment so bereft
5370,BOOK VI.,Infatuate Glaucus that with Tydeus’ son
5371,BOOK VI.,"He barter’d gold for brass, an hundred beeves290"
5372,BOOK VI.,"In value, for the value small of nine."
5373,BOOK VI.,But Hector at the Scæan gate and beech[18]
5374,BOOK VI.,"Meantime arrived, to whose approach the wives"
5375,BOOK VI.,"And daughters flock’d of Troy, inquiring each"
5376,BOOK VI.,"The fate of husband, brother, son, or friend.295"
5377,BOOK VI.,He bade them all with solemn prayer the Gods
5378,BOOK VI.,"Seek fervent, for that wo was on the wing."
5379,BOOK VI.,"But when he enter’d Priam’s palace, built"
5380,BOOK VI.,"With splendid porticoes, and which within"
5381,BOOK VI.,"Had fifty chambers lined with polish’d stone,300"
5382,BOOK VI.,"Contiguous all, where Priam’s sons reposed"
5383,BOOK VI.,"And his sons’ wives, and where, on the other side."
5384,BOOK VI.,In twelve magnificent chambers also lined
5385,BOOK VI.,"With polish’d marble and contiguous all,"
5386,BOOK VI.,The sons-in-law of Priam lay beside305
5387,BOOK VI.,"His spotless daughters, there the mother queen"
5388,BOOK VI.,"Seeking the chamber of Laodice,"
5389,BOOK VI.,"Loveliest of all her children, as she went"
5390,BOOK VI.,Met Hector. On his hand she hung and said:
5391,BOOK VI.,"Why leavest thou, O my son! the dangerous field?310"
5392,BOOK VI.,I fear that the Achaians (hateful name!)
5393,BOOK VI.,"Compass the walls so closely, that thou seek’st"
5394,BOOK VI.,"Urged by distress the citadel, to lift"
5395,BOOK VI.,Thine hands in prayer to Jove? But pause awhile
5396,BOOK VI.,"Till I shall bring thee wine, that having pour’d315"
5397,BOOK VI.,Libation rich to Jove and to the powers
5398,BOOK VI.,"Immortal, thou may’st drink and be refresh’d."
5399,BOOK VI.,For wine is mighty to renew the strength
5400,BOOK VI.,"Of weary man, and weary thou must be"
5401,BOOK VI.,"Thyself, thus long defending us and ours.320"
5402,BOOK VI.,To whom her son majestic thus replied.
5403,BOOK VI.,"My mother, whom I reverence! cheering wine"
5404,BOOK VI.,"Bring none to me, lest I forget my might.[19]"
5405,BOOK VI.,"I fear, beside, with unwash’d hands to pour"
5406,BOOK VI.,"Libation forth of sable wine to Jove,325"
5407,BOOK VI.,"And dare on none account, thus blood-defiled,[20]"
5408,BOOK VI.,Approach the tempest-stirring God in prayer.
5409,BOOK VI.,"Thou, therefore, gathering all our matrons, seek"
5410,BOOK VI.,"The fane of Pallas, huntress of the spoil,"
5411,BOOK VI.,Bearing sweet incense; but from the attire330
5412,BOOK VI.,"Treasured within thy chamber, first select"
5413,BOOK VI.,"The amplest robe, most exquisitely wrought,"
5414,BOOK VI.,And which thou prizest most—then spread the gift
5415,BOOK VI.,On Athenæan Pallas’ lap divine.
5416,BOOK VI.,"Twelve heifers also of the year, untouch’d335"
5417,BOOK VI.,"With puncture of the goad, promise to slay"
5418,BOOK VI.,"In sacrifice, if she will pity Troy,"
5419,BOOK VI.,"Our wives and little ones, and will avert"
5420,BOOK VI.,"The son of Tydeus from these sacred towers,"
5421,BOOK VI.,"That dreadful Chief, terror of all our host.340"
5422,BOOK VI.,"Go then, my mother, seek the hallowed fane"
5423,BOOK VI.,"Of the spoil-huntress Deity. I, the while,"
5424,BOOK VI.,"Seek Paris, and if Paris yet can hear,"
5425,BOOK VI.,Shall call him forth. But oh that earth would yawn
5426,BOOK VI.,"And swallow him, whom Jove hath made a curse345"
5427,BOOK VI.,"To Troy, to Priam, and to all his house;"
5428,BOOK VI.,"Methinks, to see him plunged into the shades"
5429,BOOK VI.,"For ever, were a cure for all my woes."
5430,BOOK VI.,"He ceased; the Queen, her palace entering, charged"
5431,BOOK VI.,"Her maidens; they, incontinent, throughout350"
5432,BOOK VI.,"All Troy convened the matrons, as she bade."
5433,BOOK VI.,"Meantime into her wardrobe incense-fumed,"
5434,BOOK VI.,"Herself descended; there her treasures lay,"
5435,BOOK VI.,"Works of Sidonian women,[21] whom her son"
5436,BOOK VI.,"The godlike Paris, when he cross’d the seas355"
5437,BOOK VI.,"With Jove-begotten Helen, brought to Troy."
5438,BOOK VI.,"The most magnificent, and varied most"
5439,BOOK VI.,"With colors radiant, from the rest she chose"
5440,BOOK VI.,"For Pallas; vivid as a star it shone,"
5441,BOOK VI.,"And lowest lay of all. Then forth she went,360"
5442,BOOK VI.,The Trojan matrons all following her steps.
5443,BOOK VI.,But when the long procession reach’d the fane
5444,BOOK VI.,"Of Pallas in the heights of Troy, to them"
5445,BOOK VI.,"The fair Theano ope’d the portals wide,"
5446,BOOK VI.,"Daughter of Cisseus, brave Antenor’s spouse,365"
5447,BOOK VI.,"And by appointment public, at that time,"
5448,BOOK VI.,Priestess of Pallas. All with lifted hands[22]
5449,BOOK VI.,In presence of Minerva wept aloud.
5450,BOOK VI.,Beauteous Theano on the Goddess’ lap
5451,BOOK VI.,"Then spread the robe, and to the daughter fair370"
5452,BOOK VI.,Of Jove omnipotent her suit address’d.
5453,BOOK VI.,"Goddess[23] of Goddesses, our city’s shield,"
5454,BOOK VI.,"Adored Minerva, hear! oh! break the lance"
5455,BOOK VI.,"Of Diomede, and give himself to fall"
5456,BOOK VI.,Prone in the dust before the Scæan gate.375
5457,BOOK VI.,"So will we offer to thee at thy shrine,"
5458,BOOK VI.,"This day twelve heifers of the year, untouch’d"
5459,BOOK VI.,"By yoke or goad, if thou wilt pity show"
5460,BOOK VI.,"To Troy, and save our children and our wives."
5461,BOOK VI.,"Such prayer the priestess offer’d, and such prayer380"
5462,BOOK VI.,All present; whom Minerva heard averse.
5463,BOOK VI.,But Hector to the palace sped meantime
5464,BOOK VI.,"Of Alexander, which himself had built,"
5465,BOOK VI.,Aided by every architect of name
5466,BOOK VI.,"Illustrious then in Troy. Chamber it had,385"
5467,BOOK VI.,"Wide hall, proud dome, and on the heights of Troy"
5468,BOOK VI.,Near-neighboring Hector’s house and Priam’s stood.
5469,BOOK VI.,"There enter’d Hector, Jove-beloved, a spear"
5470,BOOK VI.,"Its length eleven cubits in his hand,"
5471,BOOK VI.,Its glittering head bound with a ring of gold.390
5472,BOOK VI.,"He found within his chamber whom he sought,"
5473,BOOK VI.,Polishing with exactest care his arms
5474,BOOK VI.,"Resplendent, shield and hauberk fingering o’er"
5475,BOOK VI.,"With curious touch, and tampering with his bow.[24]"
5476,BOOK VI.,Helen of Argos with her female train395
5477,BOOK VI.,"Sat occupied, the while, to each in turn"
5478,BOOK VI.,Some splendid task assigning. Hector fix’d
5479,BOOK VI.,"His eyes on Paris, and him stern rebuked."
5480,BOOK VI.,"Thy sullen humors, Paris, are ill-timed."
5481,BOOK VI.,The people perish at our lofty walls;400
5482,BOOK VI.,The flames of war have compass’d Troy around
5483,BOOK VI.,And thou hast kindled them; who yet thyself
5484,BOOK VI.,That slackness show’st which in another seen
5485,BOOK VI.,"Thou would’st resent to death. Haste, seek the field"
5486,BOOK VI.,"This moment, lest, the next, all Ilium blaze.405"
5487,BOOK VI.,"To whom thus Paris, graceful as a God."
5488,BOOK VI.,"Since, Hector, thou hast charged me with a fault,"
5489,BOOK VI.,"And not unjustly, I will answer make,"
5490,BOOK VI.,"And give thou special heed. That here I sit,"
5491,BOOK VI.,"The cause is sorrow, which I wish’d to soothe410"
5492,BOOK VI.,"In secret, not displeasure or revenge."
5493,BOOK VI.,"I tell thee also, that even now my wife"
5494,BOOK VI.,Was urgent with me in most soothing terms
5495,BOOK VI.,"That I would forth to battle; and myself,"
5496,BOOK VI.,"Aware that victory oft changes sides,415"
5497,BOOK VI.,"That course prefer. Wait, therefore, thou awhile,"
5498,BOOK VI.,"Till I shall dress me for the fight, or go"
5499,BOOK VI.,"Thou first, and I will overtake thee soon."
5500,BOOK VI.,"He ceased, to whom brave Hector answer none"
5501,BOOK VI.,"Return’d, when Helen him with lenient speech420"
5502,BOOK VI.,Accosted mild.[25] My brother! who in me
5503,BOOK VI.,"Hast found a sister worthy of thy hate,"
5504,BOOK VI.,"Authoress of all calamity to Troy,"
5505,BOOK VI.,"Oh that the winds, the day when I was born,"
5506,BOOK VI.,"Had swept me out of sight, whirl’d me aloft425"
5507,BOOK VI.,"To some inhospitable mountain-top,"
5508,BOOK VI.,Or plunged me in the deep; there I had sunk
5509,BOOK VI.,"O’erwhelm’d, and all these ills had never been."
5510,BOOK VI.,"But since the Gods would bring these ills to pass,"
5511,BOOK VI.,"I should, at least, some worthier mate have chosen,430"
5512,BOOK VI.,One not insensible to public shame.
5513,BOOK VI.,"But this, oh this, nor hath nor will acquire"
5514,BOOK VI.,"Hereafter, aught which like discretion shows"
5515,BOOK VI.,"Or reason, and shall find his just reward."
5516,BOOK VI.,But enter; take this seat; for who as thou435
5517,BOOK VI.,"Labors, or who hath cause like thee to rue"
5518,BOOK VI.,"The crime, my brother, for which Heaven hath doom’d"
5519,BOOK VI.,Both Paris and my most detested self
5520,BOOK VI.,To be the burthens of an endless song?
5521,BOOK VI.,To whom the warlike Hector huge[26] replied.440
5522,BOOK VI.,"Me bid not, Helen, to a seat, howe’er"
5523,BOOK VI.,"Thou wish my stay, for thou must not prevail."
5524,BOOK VI.,"The Trojans miss me, and myself no less"
5525,BOOK VI.,Am anxious to return. But urge in haste
5526,BOOK VI.,"This loiterer forth; yea, let him urge himself445"
5527,BOOK VI.,To overtake me ere I quit the town.
5528,BOOK VI.,"For I must home in haste, that I may see"
5529,BOOK VI.,"My loved Andromache, my infant boy,"
5530,BOOK VI.,"And my domestics, ignorant if e’er"
5531,BOOK VI.,"I shall behold them more, or if my fate450"
5532,BOOK VI.,Ordain me now to fall by Grecian hands.
5533,BOOK VI.,"So spake the dauntless hero, and withdrew."
5534,BOOK VI.,But reaching soon his own well-built abode
5535,BOOK VI.,He found not fair Andromache; she stood
5536,BOOK VI.,"Lamenting Hector, with the nurse who bore455"
5537,BOOK VI.,"Her infant, on a turret’s top sublime."
5538,BOOK VI.,"He then, not finding his chaste spouse within,"
5539,BOOK VI.,"Thus from the portal, of her train inquired."
5540,BOOK VI.,"Tell me, ye maidens, whither went from home"
5541,BOOK VI.,Andromache the fair?[27] Went she to see460
5542,BOOK VI.,"Her female kindred of my father’s house,"
5543,BOOK VI.,"Or to Minerva’s temple, where convened"
5544,BOOK VI.,The bright-hair’d matrons of the city seek
5545,BOOK VI.,To soothe the awful Goddess? Tell me true.
5546,BOOK VI.,To whom his household’s governess discreet.465
5547,BOOK VI.,"Since, Hector, truth is thy demand, receive"
5548,BOOK VI.,True answer. Neither went she forth to see
5549,BOOK VI.,"Her female kindred of thy father’s house,"
5550,BOOK VI.,"Nor to Minerva’s temple, where convened"
5551,BOOK VI.,The bright-haired matrons of the city seek470
5552,BOOK VI.,To soothe the awful Goddess; but she went
5553,BOOK VI.,Hence to the tower of Troy: for she had heard
5554,BOOK VI.,"That the Achaians had prevail’d, and driven"
5555,BOOK VI.,"The Trojans to the walls; she, therefore, wild"
5556,BOOK VI.,"With grief, flew thither, and the nurse her steps475"
5557,BOOK VI.,"Attended, with thy infant in her arms."
5558,BOOK VI.,So spake the prudent governess; whose words
5559,BOOK VI.,"When Hector heard, issuing from his door"
5560,BOOK VI.,He backward trod with hasty steps the streets
5561,BOOK VI.,"Of lofty Troy, and having traversed all480"
5562,BOOK VI.,"The spacious city, when he now approach’d"
5563,BOOK VI.,"The Scæan gate, whence he must seek the field,"
5564,BOOK VI.,"There, hasting home again his noble wife"
5565,BOOK VI.,"Met him, Andromache the rich-endow’d"
5566,BOOK VI.,Fair daughter of Eëtion famed in arms.485
5567,BOOK VI.,"Eëtion, who in Hypoplacian Thebes"
5568,BOOK VI.,"Umbrageous dwelt, Cilicia’s mighty lord—"
5569,BOOK VI.,His daughter valiant Hector had espoused.
5570,BOOK VI.,"There she encounter’d him, and with herself"
5571,BOOK VI.,"The nurse came also, bearing in her arms490"
5572,BOOK VI.,"Hectorides, his infant darling boy,"
5573,BOOK VI.,Beautiful as a star. Him Hector called
5574,BOOK VI.,"Scamandrios, but Astyanax[28] all else"
5575,BOOK VI.,"In Ilium named him, for that Hector’s arm"
5576,BOOK VI.,Alone was the defence and strength of Troy.495
5577,BOOK VI.,"The father, silent, eyed his babe, and smiled."
5578,BOOK VI.,"Andromache, meantime, before him stood,"
5579,BOOK VI.,"With streaming cheeks, hung on his hand, and said."
5580,BOOK VI.,"Thy own great courage will cut short thy days,"
5581,BOOK VI.,My noble Hector! neither pitiest thou500
5582,BOOK VI.,"Thy helpless infant, or my hapless self,"
5583,BOOK VI.,Whose widowhood is near; for thou wilt fall
5584,BOOK VI.,"Ere long, assail’d by the whole host of Greece."
5585,BOOK VI.,"Then let me to the tomb, my best retreat"
5586,BOOK VI.,When thou art slain. For comfort none or joy505
5587,BOOK VI.,"Can I expect, thy day of life extinct,"
5588,BOOK VI.,"But thenceforth, sorrow. Father I have none;"
5589,BOOK VI.,"No mother. When Cilicia’s city, Thebes"
5590,BOOK VI.,"The populous, was by Achilles sack’d."
5591,BOOK VI.,He slew my father; yet his gorgeous arms510
5592,BOOK VI.,"Stripp’d not through reverence of him, but consumed,"
5593,BOOK VI.,"Arm’d as it was, his body on the pile,"
5594,BOOK VI.,"And heap’d his tomb, which the Oreades,"
5595,BOOK VI.,"Jove’s daughters, had with elms inclosed around.[29]"
5596,BOOK VI.,"My seven brothers, glory of our house,515"
5597,BOOK VI.,All in one day descended to the shades;
5598,BOOK VI.,"For brave Achilles,[30] while they fed their herds"
5599,BOOK VI.,"And snowy flocks together, slew them all."
5600,BOOK VI.,"My mother, Queen of the well-wooded realm"
5601,BOOK VI.,"Of Hypoplacian Thebes, her hither brought520"
5602,BOOK VI.,"Among his other spoils, he loosed again"
5603,BOOK VI.,"At an inestimable ransom-price,"
5604,BOOK VI.,"But by Diana pierced, she died at home."
5605,BOOK VI.,Yet Hector—oh my husband! I in thee
5606,BOOK VI.,"Find parents, brothers, all that I have lost.525"
5607,BOOK VI.,"Come! have compassion on us. Go not hence,"
5608,BOOK VI.,"But guard this turret, lest of me thou make"
5609,BOOK VI.,"A widow, and an orphan of thy boy."
5610,BOOK VI.,The city walls are easiest of ascent
5611,BOOK VI.,At yonder fig-tree; station there thy powers;530
5612,BOOK VI.,"For whether by a prophet warn’d, or taught"
5613,BOOK VI.,"By search and observation, in that part"
5614,BOOK VI.,"Each Ajax with Idomeneus of Crete,"
5615,BOOK VI.,"The sons of Atreus, and the valiant son"
5616,BOOK VI.,"Of Tydeus, have now thrice assail’d the town.535"
5617,BOOK VI.,To whom the leader of the host of Troy.
5618,BOOK VI.,"These cares, Andromache, which thee engage,"
5619,BOOK VI.,All touch me also; but I dread to incur
5620,BOOK VI.,"The scorn of male and female tongues in Troy,"
5621,BOOK VI.,"If, dastard-like, I should decline the fight.540"
5622,BOOK VI.,Nor feel I such a wish. No. I have learn’d
5623,BOOK VI.,"To be courageous ever, in the van"
5624,BOOK VI.,Among the flower of Ilium to assert
5625,BOOK VI.,"My glorious father’s honor, and my own."
5626,BOOK VI.,"For that the day shall come when sacred Troy,545"
5627,BOOK VI.,"When Priam, and the people of the old"
5628,BOOK VI.,"Spear-practised King shall perish, well I know."
5629,BOOK VI.,But for no Trojan sorrows yet to come
5630,BOOK VI.,"So much I mourn, not e’en for Hecuba,"
5631,BOOK VI.,"Nor yet for Priam, nor for all the brave550"
5632,BOOK VI.,"Of my own brothers who shall kiss the dust,"
5633,BOOK VI.,"As for thyself, when some Achaian Chief"
5634,BOOK VI.,"Shall have convey’d thee weeping hence, thy sun"
5635,BOOK VI.,Of peace and liberty for ever set.
5636,BOOK VI.,Then shalt thou toil in Argos at the loom555
5637,BOOK VI.,"For a task-mistress, and constrain’d shalt draw"
5638,BOOK VI.,"From Hypereïa’s fount,[31] or from the fount"
5639,BOOK VI.,"Messeïs, water at her proud command."
5640,BOOK VI.,"Some Grecian then, seeing thy tears, shall say—"
5641,BOOK VI.,"“This was the wife of Hector, who excell’d560"
5642,BOOK VI.,All Troy in fight when Ilium was besieged.”
5643,BOOK VI.,"Such he shall speak thee, and thy heart, the while,"
5644,BOOK VI.,Shall bleed afresh through want of such a friend
5645,BOOK VI.,To stand between captivity and thee.
5646,BOOK VI.,But may I rest beneath my hill of earth565
5647,BOOK VI.,Or ere that day arrive! I would not live
5648,BOOK VI.,"To hear thy cries, and see thee torn away."
5649,BOOK VI.,"So saying, illustrious Hector stretch’d his arms"
5650,BOOK VI.,"Forth to his son, but with a scream, the child"
5651,BOOK VI.,"Fell back into the bosom of his nurse,570"
5652,BOOK VI.,"His father’s aspect dreading, whose bright arms"
5653,BOOK VI.,He had attentive mark’d and shaggy crest
5654,BOOK VI.,Playing tremendous o’er his helmet’s height.
5655,BOOK VI.,"His father and his gentle mother laugh’d,[32]"
5656,BOOK VI.,And noble Hector lifting from his head575
5657,BOOK VI.,"His dazzling helmet, placed it on the ground,"
5658,BOOK VI.,"Then kiss’d his boy and dandled him, and thus"
5659,BOOK VI.,In earnest prayer the heavenly powers implored.
5660,BOOK VI.,"Hear all ye Gods! as ye have given to me,"
5661,BOOK VI.,So also on my son excelling might580
5662,BOOK VI.,"Bestow, with chief authority in Troy."
5663,BOOK VI.,"And be his record this, in time to come,"
5664,BOOK VI.,When he returns from battle. Lo! how far
5665,BOOK VI.,The son excels the sire! May every foe
5666,BOOK VI.,"Fall under him, and he come laden home585"
5667,BOOK VI.,With spoils blood-stain’d to his dear mother’s joy.
5668,BOOK VI.,"He said, and gave his infant to the arms"
5669,BOOK VI.,"Of his Andromache, who him received"
5670,BOOK VI.,"Into her fragrant bosom, bitter tears"
5671,BOOK VI.,With sweet smiles mingling; he with pity moved590
5672,BOOK VI.,"That sight observed, soft touch’d her cheek, and said,"
5673,BOOK VI.,"Mourn not, my loved Andromache, for me"
5674,BOOK VI.,Too much; no man shall send me to the shades
5675,BOOK VI.,"Of Tartarus, ere mine allotted hour,"
5676,BOOK VI.,Nor lives he who can overpass the date595
5677,BOOK VI.,"By heaven assign’d him, be he base or brave.[33]"
5678,BOOK VI.,"Go then, and occupy content at home"
5679,BOOK VI.,"The woman’s province; ply the distaff, spin"
5680,BOOK VI.,"And weave, and task thy maidens. War belongs"
5681,BOOK VI.,To man; to all men; and of all who first600
5682,BOOK VI.,"Drew vital breath in Ilium, most to me.[34]"
5683,BOOK VI.,
5684,BOOK VI.,"He ceased, and from the ground his helmet raised"
5685,BOOK VI.,"Hair-crested; his Andromache, at once"
5686,BOOK VI.,"Obedient, to her home repair’d, but oft"
5687,BOOK VI.,"Turn’d as she went, and, turning, wept afresh.605"
5688,BOOK VI.,No sooner at the palace she arrived
5689,BOOK VI.,"Of havoc-spreading Hector, than among"
5690,BOOK VI.,"Her numerous maidens found within, she raised"
5691,BOOK VI.,"A general lamentation; with one voice,"
5692,BOOK VI.,"In his own house, his whole domestic train610"
5693,BOOK VI.,"Mourn’d Hector, yet alive; for none the hope"
5694,BOOK VI.,"Conceived of his escape from Grecian hands,"
5695,BOOK VI.,Or to behold their living master more.
5696,BOOK VI.,Nor Paris in his stately mansion long
5697,BOOK VI.,"Delay’d, but, arm’d resplendent, traversed swift615"
5698,BOOK VI.,"The city, all alacrity and joy."
5699,BOOK VI.,"As some stall’d horse high-fed, his stable-cord"
5700,BOOK VI.,"Snapt short, beats under foot the sounding plain,"
5701,BOOK VI.,Accustomed in smooth-sliding streams to lave
5702,BOOK VI.,"Exulting; high he bears his head, his mane620"
5703,BOOK VI.,"Undulates o’er his shoulders, pleased he eyes"
5704,BOOK VI.,"His glossy sides, and borne on pliant knees"
5705,BOOK VI.,Shoots to the meadow where his fellows graze;
5706,BOOK VI.,"So Paris, son of Priam, from the heights"
5707,BOOK VI.,"Of Pergamus into the streets of Troy,625"
5708,BOOK VI.,"All dazzling as the sun, descended, flush’d"
5709,BOOK VI.,"With martial pride, and bounding in his course."
5710,BOOK VI.,At once he came where noble Hector stood
5711,BOOK VI.,"Now turning, after conference with his spouse,"
5712,BOOK VI.,When godlike Alexander thus began.630
5713,BOOK VI.,"My hero brother, thou hast surely found"
5714,BOOK VI.,My long delay most irksome. More dispatch
5715,BOOK VI.,"Had pleased thee more, for such was thy command."
5716,BOOK VI.,To whom the warlike Hector thus replied.
5717,BOOK VI.,"No man, judicious, and in feat of arms635"
5718,BOOK VI.,"Intelligent, would pour contempt on thee"
5719,BOOK VI.,(For thou art valiant) wert thou not remiss
5720,BOOK VI.,And wilful negligent; and when I hear
5721,BOOK VI.,The very men who labor in thy cause
5722,BOOK VI.,"Reviling thee, I make thy shame my own.640"
5723,BOOK VI.,But let us on. All such complaints shall cease
5724,BOOK VI.,"Hereafter, and thy faults be touch’d no more,"
5725,BOOK VI.,Let Jove but once afford us riddance clear
5726,BOOK VI.,"Of these Achaians, and to quaff the cup"
5727,BOOK VI.,"Of liberty, before the living Gods.645"
5728,BOOK VI.,
5729,BOOK VI.,
5730,BOOK VI.,"It may be observed, that Hector begins to resume his hope of success,"
5731,BOOK VI.,"and his warlike spirit is roused again, as he approaches the field of"
5732,BOOK VI.,action. The depressing effect of his sad interview is wearing away from
5733,BOOK VI.,"his mind, and he is already prepared for the battle with Ajax, which"
5734,BOOK VI.,awaits him.
5735,BOOK VI.,
5736,BOOK VI.,"The student who has once read this book, will read it again and again."
5737,BOOK VI.,It contains much that is addressed to the deepest feelings of our
5738,BOOK VI.,"common nature, and, despite of the long interval of time which lies"
5739,BOOK VI.,between our age and the Homeric—despite the manifold changes of
5740,BOOK VI.,"customs, habits, pursuits, and the advances that have been made in"
5741,BOOK VI.,"civilization and art—despite of all these, the universal spirit of"
5742,BOOK VI.,humanity will recognize in these scenes much of that true poetry which
5743,BOOK VI.,"delights alike all ages, all nations, all men.—Felton."

5764,BOOK VII.,"To longing mariners, who with smooth oars5"
5765,BOOK VII.,"Threshing the waves have all their strength consumed,"

5770,BOOK VII.,And of Philomedusa radiant-eyed.

5772,BOOK VII.,Eïoneus; he pierced his neck beneath
5773,BOOK VII.,"His brazen morion’s verge, and dead he fell."

5786,BOOK VII.,
5787,BOOK VII.,Daughter of Jove supreme! why hast thou left
5788,BOOK VII.,"Olympus, and with such impetuous speed?"
5789,BOOK VII.,Comest thou to give the Danaï success
5790,BOOK VII.,Decisive? For I know that pity none30

5792,BOOK VII.,But if advice of mine can influence thee
5793,BOOK VII.,"To that which shall be best, let us compose"
5794,BOOK VII.,This day the furious fight which shall again
5795,BOOK VII.,"Hereafter rage, till Ilium be destroy’d.35"
5796,BOOK VII.,Since such is Juno’s pleasure and thy own.
5797,BOOK VII.,Him answer’d then Pallas cærulean-eyed.
5798,BOOK VII.,Celestial archer! be it so. I came
5799,BOOK VII.,Myself so purposing into the field
5800,BOOK VII.,From the Olympian heights. But by what means40
5801,BOOK VII.,Wilt thou induce the warriors to a pause?
5802,BOOK VII.,"To whom the King, the son of Jove, replied."
5803,BOOK VII.,The courage of equestrian Hector bold

5807,BOOK VII.,"Indignant, will supply a champion soon"
5808,BOOK VII.,To combat with the noble Chief of Troy.
5809,BOOK VII.,"So spake Apollo, and his counsel pleased"
5810,BOOK VII.,"Minerva; which when Helenus the seer,50"
5811,BOOK VII.,"Priam’s own son, in his prophetic soul"
5812,BOOK VII.,"Perceived, approaching Hector, thus he spake."
5813,BOOK VII.,"Jove’s peer in wisdom, Hector, Priam’s son!"

5815,BOOK VII.,Bid cease the battle. Bid both armies sit.55

5833,BOOK VII.,Such seem’d the plain whereon the Achaians sat
5834,BOOK VII.,"And Trojans, whom between thus Hector spake."
5835,BOOK VII.,"Ye Trojans and Achaians brazen-greaved,75"
5836,BOOK VII.,Attend while I shall speak! Jove high-enthroned
5837,BOOK VII.,"Hath not fulfill’d the truce, but evil plans"
5838,BOOK VII.,"Against both hosts, till either ye shall take"
5839,BOOK VII.,"Troy’s lofty towers, or shall yourselves in flight"
5840,BOOK VII.,Fall vanquish’d at your billow-cleaving barks.80
5841,BOOK VII.,With you is all the flower of Greece.[2] Let him
5842,BOOK VII.,Whose heart shall move him to encounter sole
5843,BOOK VII.,"Illustrious Hector, from among you all"
5844,BOOK VII.,"Stand forth, and Jove be witness to us both."
5845,BOOK VII.,"If he, with his long-pointed lance, of life85"
5846,BOOK VII.,"Shall me bereave, my armor is his prize,"
5847,BOOK VII.,Which he shall hence into your fleet convey;
5848,BOOK VII.,Not so my body; that he shall resign
5849,BOOK VII.,For burial to the men and wives of Troy.
5850,BOOK VII.,"But if Apollo make the glory mine,90"
5851,BOOK VII.,"And he fall vanquish’d, him will I despoil,"
5852,BOOK VII.,And hence conveying into sacred Troy
5853,BOOK VII.,"His arms, will in the temple hang them high[3]"
5854,BOOK VII.,"Of the bow-bender God, but I will send"
5855,BOOK VII.,"His body to the fleet, that him the Greeks95"
5856,BOOK VII.,May grace with rights funereal. On the banks
5857,BOOK VII.,Of wide-spread Hellespont ye shall upraise
5858,BOOK VII.,"His tomb, and as they cleave with oary barks"
5859,BOOK VII.,"The sable deep, posterity shall say—"
5860,BOOK VII.,“It is a warrior’s tomb; in ancient days100
5861,BOOK VII.,The Hero died; him warlike Hector slew.”
5862,BOOK VII.,"So men shall speak hereafter, and my fame"
5863,BOOK VII.,"Who slew him, and my praise, shall never die."
5864,BOOK VII.,"He ceased, and all sat mute. His challenge bold"
5865,BOOK VII.,"None dared accept, which yet they blush’d to shun,105"
5866,BOOK VII.,"Till Menelaus, at the last, arose"
5867,BOOK VII.,"Groaning profound, and thus reproach’d the Greeks."
5868,BOOK VII.,Ah boasters! henceforth women—men no more—
5869,BOOK VII.,"Eternal shame, shame infinite is ours,"
5870,BOOK VII.,If none of all the Grecians dares contend110
5871,BOOK VII.,With Hector. Dastards—deaf to glory’s call—
5872,BOOK VII.,Rot where ye sit! I will myself take arms
5873,BOOK VII.,"Against him, for the gods alone dispose,"
5874,BOOK VII.,"At their own pleasure, the events of war."
5875,BOOK VII.,"He ended, and put on his radiant arms.115"
5876,BOOK VII.,"Then, Menelaus, manifest appear’d"
5877,BOOK VII.,Thy death approaching by the dreadful hands
5878,BOOK VII.,"Of Hector, mightier far in arms than thou,"
5879,BOOK VII.,But that the Chiefs of the Achaians all
5880,BOOK VII.,"Upstarting stay’d thee, and himself the King,120"
5881,BOOK VII.,"The son of Atreus, on thy better hand"
5882,BOOK VII.,"Seizing affectionate, thee thus address’d."
5883,BOOK VII.,"Thou ravest, my royal brother! and art seized"
5884,BOOK VII.,"With needless frenzy. But, however chafed,"
5885,BOOK VII.,"Restrain thy wrath, nor covet to contend125"
5886,BOOK VII.,"With Priameian Hector, whom in fight"
5887,BOOK VII.,"All dread, a warrior thy superior far."
5888,BOOK VII.,"Not even Achilles, in the glorious field"
5889,BOOK VII.,(Though stronger far than thou) this hero meets
5890,BOOK VII.,"Undaunted. Go then, and thy seat resume130"
5891,BOOK VII.,"In thy own band; the Achaians shall for him,"
5892,BOOK VII.,"Doubtless, some fitter champion furnish forth."
5893,BOOK VII.,"Brave though he be, and with the toils of war"
5894,BOOK VII.,"Insatiable, he shall be willing yet,"
5895,BOOK VII.,"Seated on his bent knees, to breathe a while,135"
5896,BOOK VII.,Should he escape the arduous brunt severe.
5897,BOOK VII.,"So saying, the hero by his counsel wise"
5898,BOOK VII.,"His brother’s purpose alter’d; he complied,"
5899,BOOK VII.,And his glad servants eased him of his arms.
5900,BOOK VII.,Then Nestor thus the Argive host bespake.140
5901,BOOK VII.,"Great wo, ye Gods! hath on Achaia fallen."
5902,BOOK VII.,"Now may the warlike Pelaus, hoary Chief,"
5903,BOOK VII.,Who both with eloquence and wisdom rules
5904,BOOK VII.,"The Myrmidons, our foul disgrace deplore."
5905,BOOK VII.,"With him discoursing, erst, of ancient times,145"
5906,BOOK VII.,"When all your pedigrees I traced, I made"
5907,BOOK VII.,His heart bound in him at the proud report.
5908,BOOK VII.,"But now, when he shall learn how here we sat"
5909,BOOK VII.,"Cowering at the foot of Hector, he shall oft"
5910,BOOK VII.,"His hands uplift to the immortal Gods,150"
5911,BOOK VII.,Praying a swift release into the shades.
5912,BOOK VII.,Jove! Pallas! Phœbus! Oh that I were young
5913,BOOK VII.,As when the Pylians in fierce fight engaged
5914,BOOK VII.,"The Arcadians spear-expert, beside the stream"
5915,BOOK VII.,Of rapid Celadon! Beneath the walls155
5916,BOOK VII.,"We fought of Pheia, where the Jardan rolls."
5917,BOOK VII.,"There Ereuthalion, Chief of godlike form,"
5918,BOOK VII.,"Stood forth before his van, and with loud voice"
5919,BOOK VII.,Defied the Pylians. Arm’d he was in steel
5920,BOOK VII.,By royal Areïthous whilom worn;160
5921,BOOK VII.,"Brave Areïthous, Corynetes[4] named"
5922,BOOK VII.,By every tongue; for that in bow and spear
5923,BOOK VII.,"Nought trusted he, but with an iron mace"
5924,BOOK VII.,The close-embattled phalanx shatter’d wide.
5925,BOOK VII.,"Him by address, not by superior force,165"
5926,BOOK VII.,"Lycurgus vanquish’d, in a narrow pass,"
5927,BOOK VII.,Where him his iron whirl-bat[5] nought avail’d.
5928,BOOK VII.,"Lycurgus stealing on him, with his lance"
5929,BOOK VII.,Transpierced and fix’d him to the soil supine.
5930,BOOK VII.,"Him of his arms, bright gift of brazen Mars,170"
5931,BOOK VII.,"He stripp’d, which after, in the embattled field"
5932,BOOK VII.,"Lycurgus wore himself, but, growing old,"
5933,BOOK VII.,Surrender’d them to Ereuthalion’s use
5934,BOOK VII.,"His armor-bearer, high in his esteem,"
5935,BOOK VII.,And Ereuthalion wore them on the day175
5936,BOOK VII.,When he defied our best. All hung their heads
5937,BOOK VII.,And trembled; none dared meet him; till at last
5938,BOOK VII.,"With inborn courage warm’d, and nought dismayed,"
5939,BOOK VII.,"Though youngest of them all, I undertook"
5940,BOOK VII.,"That contest, and, by Pallas’ aid, prevail’d.180"
5941,BOOK VII.,I slew the man in height and bulk all men
5942,BOOK VII.,"Surpassing, and much soil he cover’d slain."
5943,BOOK VII.,Oh for the vigor of those better days!
5944,BOOK VII.,"Then should not Hector want a champion long,"
5945,BOOK VII.,"Whose call to combat, ye, although the prime185"
5946,BOOK VII.,"And pride of all our land, seem slow to hear."
5947,BOOK VII.,"He spake reproachful, when at once arose"
5948,BOOK VII.,"Nine heroes. Agamemnon, King of men,"
5949,BOOK VII.,"Foremost arose; then Tydeus’ mighty son,"
5950,BOOK VII.,With either Ajax in fierce prowess clad;190
5951,BOOK VII.,"The Cretan next, Idomeneus, with whom"
5952,BOOK VII.,"Uprose Meriones his friend approved,"
5953,BOOK VII.,Terrible as the man-destroyer Mars.
5954,BOOK VII.,Evæmon’s noble offspring next appear’d
5955,BOOK VII.,Eurypylus; Andræmon’s son the next195
5956,BOOK VII.,"Thoas; and last, Ulysses, glorious Chief."
5957,BOOK VII.,All these stood ready to engage in arms
5958,BOOK VII.,"With warlike Hector, when the ancient King,"
5959,BOOK VII.,"Gerenian Nestor, thus his speech resumed."
5960,BOOK VII.,Now cast the lot for all. Who wins the chance200
5961,BOOK VII.,"Shall yield Achaia service, and himself"
5962,BOOK VII.,"Serve also, if successful he escape"
5963,BOOK VII.,This brunt of hostile hardiment severe.
5964,BOOK VII.,"So Nestor. They, inscribing each his lot,"
5965,BOOK VII.,Into the helmet cast it of the son205
5966,BOOK VII.,"Of Atreus, Agamemnon. Then the host"
5967,BOOK VII.,"Pray’d all, their hands uplifting, and with eyes"
5968,BOOK VII.,"To the wide heavens directed, many said[6]—"
5969,BOOK VII.,"Eternal sire! choose Ajax, or the son"
5970,BOOK VII.,"Of Tydeus, or the King himself[7] who sways210"
5971,BOOK VII.,The sceptre in Mycenæ wealth-renown’d!
5972,BOOK VII.,Such prayer the people made; then Nestor shook
5973,BOOK VII.,"The helmet, and forth leaped, whose most they wished,"
5974,BOOK VII.,The lot of Ajax. Throughout all the host
5975,BOOK VII.,"To every chief and potentate of Greece,215"
5976,BOOK VII.,From right to left the herald bore the lot
5977,BOOK VII.,By all disown’d; but when at length he reach’d
5978,BOOK VII.,"The inscriber of the lot, who cast it in,"
5979,BOOK VII.,"Illustrious Ajax, in his open palm"
5980,BOOK VII.,"The herald placed it, standing at his side.220"
5981,BOOK VII.,"He, conscious, with heroic joy the lot"
5982,BOOK VII.,"Cast at his foot, and thus exclaim’d aloud."
5983,BOOK VII.,"My friends! the lot is mine,[8] and my own heart"
5984,BOOK VII.,Rejoices also; for I nothing doubt
5985,BOOK VII.,That noble Hector shall be foil’d by me.225
5986,BOOK VII.,"But while I put mine armor on, pray all"
5987,BOOK VII.,"In silence to the King Saturnian Jove,"
5988,BOOK VII.,"Lest, while ye pray, the Trojans overhear."
5989,BOOK VII.,"Or pray aloud, for whom have we to dread?"
5990,BOOK VII.,No man shall my firm standing by his strength230
5991,BOOK VII.,"Unsettle, or for ignorance of mine"
5992,BOOK VII.,"Me vanquish, who, I hope, brought forth and train’d"
5993,BOOK VII.,"In Salamis, have, now, not much to learn."
5994,BOOK VII.,He ended. They with heaven-directed eyes
5995,BOOK VII.,"The King in prayer address’d, Saturnian Jove.235"
5996,BOOK VII.,Jove! glorious father! who from Ida’s height
5997,BOOK VII.,"Controlest all below, let Ajax prove"
5998,BOOK VII.,Victorious; make the honor all his own!
5999,BOOK VII.,"Or, if not less than Ajax, Hector share"
6000,BOOK VII.,"Thy love and thy regard, divide the prize240"
6001,BOOK VII.,"Of glory, and let each achieve renown!"
6002,BOOK VII.,"Then Ajax put his radiant armor on,"
6003,BOOK VII.,"And, arm’d complete, rush’d forward. As huge Mars"
6004,BOOK VII.,To battle moves the sons of men between
6005,BOOK VII.,Whom Jove with heart-devouring thirst inspires245
6006,BOOK VII.,"Of war, so moved huge Ajax to the fight,"
6007,BOOK VII.,"Tower of the Greeks, dilating with a smile"
6008,BOOK VII.,"His martial features terrible; on feet,"
6009,BOOK VII.,"Firm-planted, to the combat he advanced"
6010,BOOK VII.,"Stride after stride, and shook his quivering spear.250"
6011,BOOK VII.,"Him viewing, Argos’ universal host"
6012,BOOK VII.,"Exulted, while a panic loosed the knees"
6013,BOOK VII.,Of every Trojan; even Hector’s heart
6014,BOOK VII.,"Beat double, but escape for him remain’d"
6015,BOOK VII.,"None now, or to retreat into his ranks255"
6016,BOOK VII.,"Again, from whom himself had challenged forth."
6017,BOOK VII.,Ajax advancing like a tower his shield
6018,BOOK VII.,"Sevenfold, approach’d. It was the labor’d work"
6019,BOOK VII.,"Of Tychius, armorer of matchless skill,"
6020,BOOK VII.,Who dwelt in Hyla; coated with the hides260
6021,BOOK VII.,Of seven high-pamper’d bulls that shield he framed
6022,BOOK VII.,"For Ajax, and the disk plated with brass."
6023,BOOK VII.,"Advancing it before his breast, the son"
6024,BOOK VII.,"Of Telamon approach’d the Trojan Chief,"
6025,BOOK VII.,"And face to face, him threatening, thus began.265"
6026,BOOK VII.,"Now, Hector, prove, by me alone opposed,"
6027,BOOK VII.,What Chiefs the Danaï can furnish forth
6028,BOOK VII.,In absence of the lion-hearted prince
6029,BOOK VII.,"Achilles, breaker of the ranks of war."
6030,BOOK VII.,"He, in his billow-cleaving barks incensed270"
6031,BOOK VII.,"Against our leader Agamemnon, lies;"
6032,BOOK VII.,"But warriors of my measure, who may serve"
6033,BOOK VII.,"To cope with thee, we want not; numerous such"
6034,BOOK VII.,Are found amongst us. But begin the fight.
6035,BOOK VII.,To whom majestic Hector fierce in arms.275
6036,BOOK VII.,Ajax! heroic leader of the Greeks!
6037,BOOK VII.,Offspring of Telamon! essay not me
6038,BOOK VII.,"With words to terrify, as I were boy."
6039,BOOK VII.,Or girl unskill’d in war;[9] I am a man
6040,BOOK VII.,"Well exercised in battle, who have shed280"
6041,BOOK VII.,"The blood of many a warrior, and have learn’d,"
6042,BOOK VII.,"From hand to hand shifting my shield, to fight"
6043,BOOK VII.,"Unwearied; I can make a sport of war,"
6044,BOOK VII.,In standing fight adjusting all my steps
6045,BOOK VII.,"To martial measures sweet, or vaulting light285"
6046,BOOK VII.,"Into my chariot, thence can urge the foe."
6047,BOOK VII.,Yet in contention with a Chief like thee
6048,BOOK VII.,"I will employ no stratagem, or seek"
6049,BOOK VII.,"To smite thee privily, but with a stroke"
6050,BOOK VII.,(If I may reach thee) visible to all.290
6051,BOOK VII.,"So saying, he shook, then hurl’d his massy spear"
6052,BOOK VII.,"At Ajax, and his broad shield sevenfold"
6053,BOOK VII.,On its eighth surface of resplendent brass
6054,BOOK VII.,"Smote full; six hides the unblunted weapon pierced,"
6055,BOOK VII.,"But in the seventh stood rooted. Ajax, next,295"
6056,BOOK VII.,"Heroic Chief, hurl’d his long shadow’d spear"
6057,BOOK VII.,And struck the oval shield of Priam’s son.
6058,BOOK VII.,Through his bright disk the weapon tempest-driven
6059,BOOK VII.,"Glided, and in his hauberk-rings infixt"
6060,BOOK VII.,"At his soft flank, ripp’d wide his vest within.300"
6061,BOOK VII.,Inclined oblique he ’scaped the dreadful doom
6062,BOOK VII.,Then each from other’s shield his massy spear
6063,BOOK VII.,"Recovering quick, like lions hunger-pinch’d"
6064,BOOK VII.,"Or wild boars irresistible in force,"
6065,BOOK VII.,They fell to close encounter. Priam’s son305
6066,BOOK VII.,"The shield of Ajax at its centre smote,"
6067,BOOK VII.,"But fail’d to pierce it, for he bent his point."
6068,BOOK VII.,"Sprang Ajax then, and meeting full the targe"
6069,BOOK VII.,"Of Hector, shock’d him; through it and beyond"
6070,BOOK VII.,He urged the weapon with its sliding edge310
6071,BOOK VII.,"Athwart his neck, and blood was seen to start."
6072,BOOK VII.,"But still, for no such cause, from battle ceased"
6073,BOOK VII.,"Crest-tossing Hector, but retiring, seized"
6074,BOOK VII.,A huge stone angled sharp and black with age
6075,BOOK VII.,That on the champain lay. The bull-hide guard315
6076,BOOK VII.,Sevenfold of Ajax with that stone he smote
6077,BOOK VII.,Full on its centre; sang the circling brass.
6078,BOOK VII.,Then Ajax far a heavier stone upheaved;
6079,BOOK VII.,"He whirled it, and with might immeasurable"
6080,BOOK VII.,"Dismiss’d the mass, which with a mill-stone weight320"
6081,BOOK VII.,"Sank through the shield of Hector, and his knees"
6082,BOOK VII.,"Disabled; with his shield supine he fell,"
6083,BOOK VII.,"But by Apollo raised, stood soon again."
6084,BOOK VII.,"And now, with swords they had each other hewn,"
6085,BOOK VII.,Had not the messengers of Gods and men325
6086,BOOK VII.,"The heralds wise, Idæus on the part"
6087,BOOK VII.,"Of Ilium, and Talthybius for the Greeks,"
6088,BOOK VII.,Advancing interposed. His sceptre each
6089,BOOK VII.,"Between them held, and thus Idæus spake.[10]"
6090,BOOK VII.,"My children, cease! prolong not still the fight.330"
6091,BOOK VII.,"Ye both are dear to cloud-assembler Jove,"
6092,BOOK VII.,"Both valiant, and all know it. But the Night"
6093,BOOK VII.,"Hath fallen, and Night’s command must be obeyed."
6094,BOOK VII.,To him the son of Telamon replied.
6095,BOOK VII.,Idæus! bid thy master speak as thou.335
6096,BOOK VII.,"He is the challenger. If such his choice,"
6097,BOOK VII.,Mine differs not; I wait but to comply.
6098,BOOK VII.,Him answer’d then heroic Hector huge.
6099,BOOK VII.,"Since, Ajax, the immortal powers on thee"
6100,BOOK VII.,"Have bulk pre-eminent and strength bestow’d,340"
6101,BOOK VII.,"With such address in battle, that the host"
6102,BOOK VII.,"Of Greece hath not thine equal at the spear,"
6103,BOOK VII.,Now let the combat cease. We shall not want
6104,BOOK VII.,More fair occasion; on some future day
6105,BOOK VII.,We will not part till all-disposing heaven345
6106,BOOK VII.,"Shall give thee victory, or shall make her mine."
6107,BOOK VII.,"But Night hath fallen, and Night must be obey’d,"
6108,BOOK VII.,That them may’st gratify with thy return
6109,BOOK VII.,"The Achaians, and especially thy friends"
6110,BOOK VII.,"And thy own countrymen. I go, no less350"
6111,BOOK VII.,To exhilarate in Priam’s royal town
6112,BOOK VII.,"Men and robed matrons, who shall seek the Gods"
6113,BOOK VII.,"For me, with pious ceremonial due."
6114,BOOK VII.,"But come. We will exchange, or ere we part,"
6115,BOOK VII.,"Some princely gift, that Greece and Troy may say355"
6116,BOOK VII.,"Hereafter, with soul-wasting rage they fought,"
6117,BOOK VII.,But parted with the gentleness of friends.
6118,BOOK VII.,"So saying, he with his sheath and belt a sword"
6119,BOOK VII.,"Presented bright-emboss’d, and a bright belt"
6120,BOOK VII.,Purpureal[11] took from Ajax in return.360
6121,BOOK VII.,"Thus separated, one the Grecians sought,"
6122,BOOK VII.,And one the Trojans; they when him they saw
6123,BOOK VII.,From the unconquer’d hands return’d alive
6124,BOOK VII.,"Of Ajax, with delight their Chief received,"
6125,BOOK VII.,"And to the city led him, double joy365"
6126,BOOK VII.,Conceiving all at his unhoped escape.
6127,BOOK VII.,"On the other side, the Grecians brazen-mail’d"
6128,BOOK VII.,To noble Agamemnon introduced
6129,BOOK VII.,"Exulting Ajax, and the King of men"
6130,BOOK VII.,In honor of the conqueror slew an ox370
6131,BOOK VII.,Of the fifth year to Jove omnipotent.
6132,BOOK VII.,"Him flaying first, they carved him next and spread"
6133,BOOK VII.,"The whole abroad, then, scoring deep the flesh,"
6134,BOOK VII.,"They pierced it with the spits, and from the spits"
6135,BOOK VII.,(Once roasted well) withdrew it all again.375
6136,BOOK VII.,"Their labor thus accomplish’d, and the board"
6137,BOOK VII.,"Furnish’d with plenteous cheer, they feasted all"
6138,BOOK VII.,Till all were satisfied; nor Ajax miss’d
6139,BOOK VII.,"The conqueror’s meed, to whom the hero-king"
6140,BOOK VII.,"Wide-ruling Agamemnon, gave the chine[12]380"
6141,BOOK VII.,"Perpetual,[13] his distinguish’d portion due."
6142,BOOK VII.,The calls of hunger and of thirst at length
6143,BOOK VII.,"Both well sufficed, thus, foremost of them all"
6144,BOOK VII.,"The ancient Nestor, whose advice had oft"
6145,BOOK VII.,"Proved salutary, prudent thus began.385"
6146,BOOK VII.,"Chiefs of Achaia, and thou, chief of all,"
6147,BOOK VII.,Great Agamemnon! Many of our host
6148,BOOK VII.,"Lie slain, whose blood sprinkles, in battle shed,"
6149,BOOK VII.,"The banks of smooth Scamander, and their souls"
6150,BOOK VII.,Have journey’d down into the realms of death.390
6151,BOOK VII.,"To-morrow, therefore, let the battle pause"
6152,BOOK VII.,"As need requires, and at the peep of day"
6153,BOOK VII.,"With mules and oxen, wheel ye from all parts"
6154,BOOK VII.,"The dead, that we may burn them near the fleet."
6155,BOOK VII.,"So, home to Greece returning, will we give395"
6156,BOOK VII.,The fathers’ ashes to the children’s care.
6157,BOOK VII.,"Accumulating next, the pile around,"
6158,BOOK VII.,"One common tomb for all, with brisk dispatch"
6159,BOOK VII.,We will upbuild for more secure defence
6160,BOOK VII.,"Of us and of our fleet, strong towers and tall400"
6161,BOOK VII.,"Adjoining to the tomb, and every tower"
6162,BOOK VII.,"Shall have its ponderous gate, commodious pass"
6163,BOOK VII.,Affording to the mounted charioteer.
6164,BOOK VII.,"And last, without those towers and at their foot,"
6165,BOOK VII.,"Dig we a trench, which compassing around405"
6166,BOOK VII.,"Our camp, both steeds and warriors shall exclude,"
6167,BOOK VII.,And all fierce inroad of the haughty foe.
6168,BOOK VII.,"So counsell’d he, whom every Chief approved."
6169,BOOK VII.,"In Troy meantime, at Priam’s gate beside"
6170,BOOK VII.,"The lofty citadel, debate began410"
6171,BOOK VII.,"The assembled senators between, confused,"
6172,BOOK VII.,"Clamorous, and with furious heat pursued,"
6173,BOOK VII.,"When them Antenor, prudent, thus bespake."
6174,BOOK VII.,"Ye Trojans, Dardans, and allies of Troy,"
6175,BOOK VII.,My counsel hear! Delay not. Instant yield415
6176,BOOK VII.,"To the Atridæ, hence to be convey’d,"
6177,BOOK VII.,Helen of Greece with all that is her own.
6178,BOOK VII.,"For charged with violated oaths we fight,"
6179,BOOK VII.,And hope I none conceive that aught by us
6180,BOOK VII.,"Design’d shall prosper, unless so be done.420"
6181,BOOK VII.,He spake and sat; when from his seat arose
6182,BOOK VII.,"Paris, fair Helen’s noble paramour,"
6183,BOOK VII.,Who thus with speech impassion’d quick replied.
6184,BOOK VII.,Antenor! me thy counsel hath not pleased;
6185,BOOK VII.,Thou could’st have framed far better; but if this425
6186,BOOK VII.,"Be thy deliberate judgment, then the Gods"
6187,BOOK VII.,Make thy deliberate judgment nothing worth.
6188,BOOK VII.,"But I will speak myself. Ye Chiefs of Troy,"
6189,BOOK VII.,I tell you plain. I will not yield my spouse.
6190,BOOK VII.,But all her treasures to our house convey’d430
6191,BOOK VII.,"From Argos, those will I resign, and add"
6192,BOOK VII.,Still other compensation from my own.
6193,BOOK VII.,Thus Paris said and sat; when like the Gods
6194,BOOK VII.,"Themselves in wisdom, from his seat uprose"
6195,BOOK VII.,"Dardanian Priam, who them thus address’d.435"
6196,BOOK VII.,"Trojans, Dardanians, and allies of Troy!"
6197,BOOK VII.,I shall declare my sentence; hear ye me.
6198,BOOK VII.,"Now let the legions, as at other times,"
6199,BOOK VII.,"Take due refreshment; let the watch be set,"
6200,BOOK VII.,And keep ye vigilant guard. At early dawn440
6201,BOOK VII.,"We will dispatch Idæus to the fleet,"
6202,BOOK VII.,Who shall inform the Atridæ of this last
6203,BOOK VII.,"Resolve of Paris, author of the war."
6204,BOOK VII.,Discreet Idæus also shall propose
6205,BOOK VII.,A respite (if the Atridæ so incline)445
6206,BOOK VII.,"From war’s dread clamor, while we burn the dead."
6207,BOOK VII.,"Then will we clash again, till heaven at length"
6208,BOOK VII.,"Shall part us, and the doubtful strife decide."
6209,BOOK VII.,"He ceased, whose voice the assembly pleased, obey’d."
6210,BOOK VII.,"Then, troop by troop, the army took repast,450"
6211,BOOK VII.,And at the dawn Idæus sought the fleet.
6212,BOOK VII.,"He found the Danaï, servants of Mars,"
6213,BOOK VII.,Beside the stern of Agamemnon’s ship
6214,BOOK VII.,Consulting; and amid the assembled Chiefs
6215,BOOK VII.,"Arrived, with utterance clear them thus address’d.455"
6216,BOOK VII.,"Ye sons of Atreus, and ye Chiefs, the flower"
6217,BOOK VII.,Of all Achaia! Priam and the Chiefs
6218,BOOK VII.,"Of Ilium, bade me to your ear impart"
6219,BOOK VII.,(If chance such embassy might please your ear)
6220,BOOK VII.,"The mind of Paris, author of the war.460"
6221,BOOK VII.,The treasures which on board his ships he brought
6222,BOOK VII.,"From Argos home (oh, had he perish’d first!)"
6223,BOOK VII.,He yields them with addition from his own.
6224,BOOK VII.,Not so the consort of the glorious prince
6225,BOOK VII.,Brave Menelaus; her (although in Troy465
6226,BOOK VII.,All counsel otherwise) he still detains.
6227,BOOK VII.,Thus too I have in charge. Are ye inclined
6228,BOOK VII.,That the dread sounding clamors of the field
6229,BOOK VII.,Be caused to cease till we shall burn the dead?
6230,BOOK VII.,"Then will we clash again, till heaven at length470"
6231,BOOK VII.,"Shall part us, and the doubtful strife decide."
6232,BOOK VII.,"So spake Idæus, and all silent sat;"
6233,BOOK VII.,Till at the last brave Diomede replied.
6234,BOOK VII.,"No. We will none of Paris’ treasures now,"
6235,BOOK VII.,Nor even Helen’s self. A child may see475
6236,BOOK VII.,Destruction winging swift her course to Troy.
6237,BOOK VII.,He said. The admiring Greeks with loud applause
6238,BOOK VII.,"All praised the speech of warlike Diomede,"
6239,BOOK VII.,And answer thus the King of men return’d.
6240,BOOK VII.,Idæus! thou hast witness’d the resolve480
6241,BOOK VII.,"Of the Achaian Chiefs, whose choice is mine."
6242,BOOK VII.,"But for the slain, I shall not envy them"
6243,BOOK VII.,"A funeral pile; the spirit fled, delay"
6244,BOOK VII.,Suits not. Last rites can not too soon be paid.
6245,BOOK VII.,Burn them. And let high-thundering Jove attest485
6246,BOOK VII.,"Himself mine oath, that war shall cease the while."
6247,BOOK VII.,"So saying, he to all the Gods upraised"
6248,BOOK VII.,"His sceptre, and Idæus homeward sped"
6249,BOOK VII.,To sacred Ilium. The Dardanians there
6250,BOOK VII.,"And Trojans, all assembled, his return490"
6251,BOOK VII.,Expected anxious. He amid them told
6252,BOOK VII.,"Distinct his errand, when, at once dissolved,"
6253,BOOK VII.,"The whole assembly rose, these to collect"
6254,BOOK VII.,"The scatter’d bodies, those to gather wood;"
6255,BOOK VII.,"While on the other side, the Greeks arose495"
6256,BOOK VII.,"As sudden, and all issuing from the fleet"
6257,BOOK VII.,"Sought fuel, some, and some, the scatter’d dead."
6258,BOOK VII.,Now from the gently-swelling flood profound
6259,BOOK VII.,"The sun arising, with his earliest rays"
6260,BOOK VII.,In his ascent to heaven smote on the fields.500
6261,BOOK VII.,When Greeks and Trojans met. Scarce could the slain
6262,BOOK VII.,"Be clear distinguish’d, but they cleansed from each"
6263,BOOK VII.,"His clotted gore with water, and warm tears"
6264,BOOK VII.,"Distilling copious, heaved them to the wains."
6265,BOOK VII.,"But wailing none was heard, for such command505"
6266,BOOK VII.,Had Priam issued; therefore heaping high
6267,BOOK VII.,"The bodies, silent and with sorrowing hearts"
6268,BOOK VII.,"They burn’d them, and to sacred Troy return’d."
6269,BOOK VII.,"The Grecians also, on the funeral pile"
6270,BOOK VII.,"The bodies heaping sad, burn’d them with fire510"
6271,BOOK VII.,"Together, and return’d into the fleet."
6272,BOOK VII.,"Then, ere the peep of dawn, and while the veil"
6273,BOOK VII.,"Of night, though thinner, still o’erhung the earth,"
6274,BOOK VII.,"Achaians, chosen from the rest, the pile"
6275,BOOK VII.,Encompass’d. With a tomb (one tomb for all)515
6276,BOOK VII.,"They crown’d the spot adust, and to the tomb"
6277,BOOK VII.,(For safety of their fleet and of themselves)
6278,BOOK VII.,"Strong fortress added of high wall and tower,"
6279,BOOK VII.,With solid gates affording egress thence
6280,BOOK VII.,Commodious to the mounted charioteer;520
6281,BOOK VII.,"Deep foss and broad they also dug without,"
6282,BOOK VII.,And planted it with piles. So toil’d the Greeks.
6283,BOOK VII.,
6284,BOOK VII.,"The Gods, that mighty labor, from beside"
6285,BOOK VII.,"The Thunderer’s throne with admiration view’d,"
6286,BOOK VII.,"When Neptune, shaker of the shores, began.525"
6287,BOOK VII.,Eternal father! is there on the face
6288,BOOK VII.,Of all the boundless earth one mortal man
6289,BOOK VII.,"Who will, in times to come, consult with heaven?"
6290,BOOK VII.,"See’st thou yon height of wall, and yon deep trench"
6291,BOOK VII.,"With which the Grecians have their fleet inclosed,530"

6294,BOOK VII.,"Far as the day-spring shoots herself abroad,"
6295,BOOK VII.,"So far the glory of this work shall spread,"
6296,BOOK VII.,"While Phœbus and myself, who, toiling hard,535"
6297,BOOK VII.,"Built walls for king Laomedon, shall see"
6298,BOOK VII.,Forgotten all the labor of our hands.
6299,BOOK VII.,"To whom, indignant, thus high-thundering Jove."
6300,BOOK VII.,"Oh thou, who shakest the solid earth at will,"
6301,BOOK VII.,"What hast thou spoken? An inferior power,540"
6302,BOOK VII.,"A god of less sufficiency than thou,"
6303,BOOK VII.,Might be allowed some fear from such a cause.
6304,BOOK VII.,"Fear not. Where’er the morning shoots her beams,"
6305,BOOK VII.,Thy glory shall be known; and when the Greeks
6306,BOOK VII.,"Shall seek their country through the waves again,545"
6307,BOOK VII.,"Then break this bulwark down, submerge it whole,"
6308,BOOK VII.,And spreading deep with sand the spacious shore
6309,BOOK VII.,"As at the first, leave not a trace behind."
6310,BOOK VII.,Such conference held the Gods; and now the sun
6311,BOOK VII.,"Went down, and, that great work perform’d, the Greeks550"
6312,BOOK VII.,From tent to tent slaughter’d the fatted ox
6313,BOOK VII.,And ate their evening cheer. Meantime arrived
6314,BOOK VII.,"Large fleet with Lemnian wine; Euneus, son"
6315,BOOK VII.,"Of Jason and Hypsipile, that fleet"
6316,BOOK VII.,"From Lemnos freighted, and had stow’d on board555"
6317,BOOK VII.,A thousand measures from the rest apart
6318,BOOK VII.,For the Atridæ; but the host at large
6319,BOOK VII.,"By traffic were supplied; some barter’d brass,"
6320,BOOK VII.,"Others bright steel; some purchased wine with hides,"
6321,BOOK VII.,"These with their cattle, with their captives those,560"
6322,BOOK VII.,And the whole host prepared a glad regale.
6323,BOOK VII.,"All night the Grecians feasted, and the host"
6324,BOOK VII.,"Of Ilium, and all night deep-planning Jove"
6325,BOOK VII.,"Portended dire calamities to both,"
6326,BOOK VII.,Thundering tremendous!—Pale was every cheek;565

6432,BOOK VIII.,"They met, they clash’d; loud was the din of spears70"

6441,BOOK VIII.,"Perform’d effectual, and the people fell."
6442,BOOK VIII.,"But when the sun had climb’d the middle skies,80"

6449,BOOK VIII.,Then roar’d the thunders from the summit hurl’d
6450,BOOK VIII.,"of Ida, and his vivid lightnings flew"

6459,BOOK VIII.,"Of beauteous Helen, Paris, with a shaft"
6460,BOOK VIII.,"Had stricken where the forelock grows, a part"
6461,BOOK VIII.,Of all most mortal. Tortured by the wound
6462,BOOK VIII.,"Erect he rose, the arrow in his brain,100"
6463,BOOK VIII.,"And writhing furious, scared his fellow-steeds."
6464,BOOK VIII.,"Meantime, while, strenuous, with his falchion’s edge"
6465,BOOK VIII.,"The hoary warrior stood slashing the reins,"
6466,BOOK VIII.,Through multitudes of fierce pursuers borne
6467,BOOK VIII.,"On rapid wheels, the dauntless charioteer105"
6468,BOOK VIII.,"Approach’d him, Hector. Then, past hope, had died"
6469,BOOK VIII.,"The ancient King, but Diomede discern’d"
6470,BOOK VIII.,"His peril imminent, and with a voice"
6471,BOOK VIII.,"Like thunder, called Ulysses to his aid."
6472,BOOK VIII.,"Laertes’ noble son, for wiles renown’d!110"
6473,BOOK VIII.,"Art thou too fugitive, and turn’st thy back"
6474,BOOK VIII.,Like the base multitude? Ah! fear a lance
6475,BOOK VIII.,Implanted ignominious in thy spine.
6476,BOOK VIII.,Stop—Nestor dies. Fell Hector is at hand.
6477,BOOK VIII.,"So shouted Diomede, whose summons loud,115"
6478,BOOK VIII.,"Ulysses yet heard not, but, passing, flew"
6479,BOOK VIII.,With headlong haste to the Achaian fleet.
6480,BOOK VIII.,"Then, Diomede, unaided as he was,"
6481,BOOK VIII.,"Rush’d ardent to the vanward, and before"
6482,BOOK VIII.,The steeds of the Neleian sovereign old120
6483,BOOK VIII.,"Standing, in accents wing’d, him thus address’d."
6484,BOOK VIII.,Old Chief! these youthful warriors are too brisk
6485,BOOK VIII.,"For thee, press’d also by encroaching age,"
6486,BOOK VIII.,"Thy servant too is feeble, and thy steeds"
6487,BOOK VIII.,Are tardy. Mount my chariot. Thou shalt see125
6488,BOOK VIII.,"With what rapidity the steeds of Troy,"
6489,BOOK VIII.,"Pursuing or retreating, scour the field."
6490,BOOK VIII.,"I took them from that terror of his foes,"
6491,BOOK VIII.,"Æneas. Thine to our attendants leave,"
6492,BOOK VIII.,While these against the warlike powers of Troy130
6493,BOOK VIII.,We push direct; that Hector’s self may know
6494,BOOK VIII.,If my spear rage not furious as his own.
6495,BOOK VIII.,"He said, nor the Gerenian Chief refused."
6496,BOOK VIII.,"Thenceforth their servants, Sthenelus and good"
6497,BOOK VIII.,"Eurymedon, took charge of Nestor’s steeds,135"
6498,BOOK VIII.,And they the chariot of Tydides both
6499,BOOK VIII.,"Ascended; Nestor seized the reins, plied well"
6500,BOOK VIII.,"The scourge, and soon they met. Tydides hurl’d"
6501,BOOK VIII.,"At Hector first, while rapid he advanced;"
6502,BOOK VIII.,"But missing Hector, wounded in the breast140"
6503,BOOK VIII.,"Eniopeus his charioteer, the son"
6504,BOOK VIII.,"Of brave Thebæus, managing the steeds."
6505,BOOK VIII.,He fell; his fiery coursers at the sound
6506,BOOK VIII.,"Startled, recoil’d, and where he fell he died."
6507,BOOK VIII.,Deep sorrow for his charioteer o’erwhelm’d145
6508,BOOK VIII.,"The mind of Hector; yet, although he mourn’d"
6509,BOOK VIII.,"He left him, and another sought as brave."
6510,BOOK VIII.,"Nor wanted long his steeds a charioteer,"
6511,BOOK VIII.,"For finding soon the son of Iphitus,"
6512,BOOK VIII.,"Bold Archeptolemus, he bade him mount150"
6513,BOOK VIII.,"His chariot, and the reins gave to his hand."
6514,BOOK VIII.,"Then deeds of bloodiest note should have ensued,"
6515,BOOK VIII.,"Penn’d had the Trojans been, as lambs, in Troy,"
6516,BOOK VIII.,But for quick succor of the sire of all.
6517,BOOK VIII.,"Thundering, he downward hurled his candent bolt155"
6518,BOOK VIII.,To the horse-feet of Diomede; dire fumed
6519,BOOK VIII.,"The flaming sulphur, and both horses drove"
6520,BOOK VIII.,"Under the axle, belly to the ground."
6521,BOOK VIII.,"Forth flew the splendid reins from Nestor’s hand,"
6522,BOOK VIII.,"And thus to Diomede, appall’d, he spake.160"
6523,BOOK VIII.,
6524,BOOK VIII.,"Back to the fleet, Tydides! Can’st not see"
6525,BOOK VIII.,"That Jove ordains not, now, the victory thine?"
6526,BOOK VIII.,The son of Saturn glorifies to-day
6527,BOOK VIII.,"This Trojan, and, if such his will, can make"
6528,BOOK VIII.,The morrow ours; but vain it is to thwart165
6529,BOOK VIII.,"The mind of Jove, for he is Lord of all."
6530,BOOK VIII.,To him the valiant Diomede replied.
6531,BOOK VIII.,"Thou hast well said, old warrior! but the pang"
6532,BOOK VIII.,"That wrings my soul, is this. The public ear"
6533,BOOK VIII.,In Ilium shall from Hector’s lips be told—170
6534,BOOK VIII.,I drove Tydides—fearing me he fled.
6535,BOOK VIII.,"So shall he vaunt, and may the earth her jaws"
6536,BOOK VIII.,That moment opening swallow me alive!
6537,BOOK VIII.,Him answer’d the Gerenian warrior old.
6538,BOOK VIII.,"What saith the son of Tydeus, glorious Chief?175"
6539,BOOK VIII.,Should Hector so traduce thee as to call
6540,BOOK VIII.,"Thee base and timid, neither Trojan him"
6541,BOOK VIII.,"Nor Dardan would believe, nor yet the wives"
6542,BOOK VIII.,"Of numerous shielded warriors brave of Troy,"
6543,BOOK VIII.,Widow’d by thy unconquerable arm.180
6544,BOOK VIII.,"So saying, he through the fugitives his steeds"
6545,BOOK VIII.,Turn’d swift to flight. Then Hector and his host
6546,BOOK VIII.,With clamor infinite their darts wo-wing’d
6547,BOOK VIII.,"Shower’d after them, and Hector, mighty Chief"
6548,BOOK VIII.,"Majestic, from afar, thus call’d aloud.185"
6549,BOOK VIII.,Tydides! thee the Danaï swift-horsed
6550,BOOK VIII.,"Were wont to grace with a superior seat,"
6551,BOOK VIII.,"The mess of honor, and the brimming cup,"
6552,BOOK VIII.,But now will mock thee. Thou art woman now.
6553,BOOK VIII.,"Go, timorous girl! Thou never shalt behold190"
6554,BOOK VIII.,"Me flying, climb our battlements, or lead"
6555,BOOK VIII.,Our women captive. I will slay thee first.
6556,BOOK VIII.,He ceased. Then Diomede in dread suspense
6557,BOOK VIII.,"Thrice purposed, turning, to withstand the foe,"
6558,BOOK VIII.,And thrice in thunder from the mountain-top195
6559,BOOK VIII.,Jove gave the signal of success to Troy.
6560,BOOK VIII.,When Hector thus the Trojans hail’d aloud.
6561,BOOK VIII.,"Trojans and Lycians, and close-warring sons"

6563,BOOK VIII.,"Now, now be men! I know that from his heart200"
6564,BOOK VIII.,Saturnian Jove glory and bright success
6565,BOOK VIII.,"For me prepares, but havoc for the Greeks."
6566,BOOK VIII.,Fools! they shall find this wall which they have raised
6567,BOOK VIII.,"Too weak to check my course, a feeble guard"
6568,BOOK VIII.,Contemptible; such also is the trench;205
6569,BOOK VIII.,My steeds shall slight it with an easy leap.
6570,BOOK VIII.,"But when ye see me in their fleet arrived,"
6571,BOOK VIII.,Remember fire. Then bring me flaming brands
6572,BOOK VIII.,That I may burn their galleys and themselves
6573,BOOK VIII.,"Slaughter beside them, struggling in the smoke.[8]210"
6574,BOOK VIII.,"He spake, and thus encouraged next his steeds."
6575,BOOK VIII.,Xanthus! Podargus! and ye generous pair
6576,BOOK VIII.,Æthon and glossy Lampus! now requite
6577,BOOK VIII.,"Mine, and the bounty of Andromache,"
6578,BOOK VIII.,Far-famed Eëtion’s daughter; she your bowl215
6579,BOOK VIII.,With corn fresh-flavor’d and with wine full oft
6580,BOOK VIII.,"Hath mingled, your refreshment seeking first"
6581,BOOK VIII.,"Ere mine, who have a youthful husband’s claim.[9]"
6582,BOOK VIII.,Now follow! now be swift; that we may seize
6583,BOOK VIII.,"The shield of Nestor, bruited to the skies220"
6584,BOOK VIII.,"As golden all, trappings and disk alike."
6585,BOOK VIII.,Now from the shoulders of the equestrian Chief
6586,BOOK VIII.,"Tydides tear we off his splendid mail,"
6587,BOOK VIII.,"The work of Vulcan.[10] May we take but these,"
6588,BOOK VIII.,"I have good hope that, ere this night be spent,225"
6589,BOOK VIII.,The Greeks shall climb their galleys and away.
6590,BOOK VIII.,"So vaunted he, but Juno with disdain"
6591,BOOK VIII.,"His proud boast heard, and shuddering in her throne,"
6592,BOOK VIII.,Rock’d the Olympian; turning then toward
6593,BOOK VIII.,"The Ocean’s mighty sovereign, thus she spake.230"
6594,BOOK VIII.,"Alas! earth-shaking sovereign of the waves,"
6595,BOOK VIII.,Feel’st thou no pity of the perishing Greeks?
6596,BOOK VIII.,"Yet Greece, in Helice, with gifts nor few"
6597,BOOK VIII.,"Nor sordid, and in Ægæ, honors thee,"
6598,BOOK VIII.,Whom therefore thou shouldst prosper. Would we all235
6599,BOOK VIII.,Who favor Greece associate to repulse
6600,BOOK VIII.,"The Trojans, and to check loud-thundering Jove,"
6601,BOOK VIII.,On Ida seated he might lour alone.
6602,BOOK VIII.,"To whom the Sovereign, Shaker of the Shores,"
6603,BOOK VIII.,Indignant. Juno! rash in speech! what word240
6604,BOOK VIII.,"Hath ’scaped thy lips? never, with my consent,"
6605,BOOK VIII.,"Shall we, the powers subordinate, in arms"
6606,BOOK VIII.,With Jove contend. He far excels us all.
6607,BOOK VIII.,"So they. Meantime, the trench and wall between,[11]"
6608,BOOK VIII.,The narrow interval with steeds was fill’d245
6609,BOOK VIII.,Close throng’d and shielded warriors. There immew’d
6610,BOOK VIII.,"By Priameian Hector, fierce as Mars,"
6611,BOOK VIII.,"They stood, for Hector had the help of Jove."
6612,BOOK VIII.,And now with blazing fire their gallant barks
6613,BOOK VIII.,"He had consumed, but Juno moved the mind250"
6614,BOOK VIII.,"Of Agamemnon, vigilant himself,"
6615,BOOK VIII.,To exhortation of Achaia’s host.
6616,BOOK VIII.,"Through camp and fleet the monarch took his way,"
6617,BOOK VIII.,"And, his wide robe imperial in his hand,"
6618,BOOK VIII.,"High on Ulysses’ huge black galley stood,255"
6619,BOOK VIII.,The central ship conspicuous; thence his voice
6620,BOOK VIII.,Might reach the most remote of all the line
6621,BOOK VIII.,"At each extreme, where Ajax had his tent"
6622,BOOK VIII.,"Pitch’d, and Achilles, fearless of surprise."
6623,BOOK VIII.,"Thence, with loud voice, the Grecians thus he hail’d.260"
6624,BOOK VIII.,Oh shame to Greece! Warriors in show alone!
6625,BOOK VIII.,Where is your boasted prowess? Ye profess’d
6626,BOOK VIII.,"Vain-glorious erst in Lemnos, while ye fed"
6627,BOOK VIII.,"Plenteously on the flesh of beeves full-grown,"
6628,BOOK VIII.,"And crown’d your beakers high, that ye would face265"
6629,BOOK VIII.,Each man a hundred Trojans in the field—
6630,BOOK VIII.,"Ay, twice a hundred—yet are all too few"
6631,BOOK VIII.,To face one Hector now; nor doubt I aught
6632,BOOK VIII.,But he shall soon fire the whole fleet of Greece.
6633,BOOK VIII.,Jove! Father! what great sovereign ever felt270
6634,BOOK VIII.,Thy frowns as I? Whom hast thou shamed as me?
6635,BOOK VIII.,"Yet I neglected not, through all the course"
6636,BOOK VIII.,Of our disasterous voyage (in the hope
6637,BOOK VIII.,"That we should vanquish Troy) thy sacred rites,"
6638,BOOK VIII.,"But where I found thine altar, piled it high275"
6639,BOOK VIII.,"With fat and flesh of bulls, on every shore."
6640,BOOK VIII.,"But oh, vouchsafe to us, that we at least"
6641,BOOK VIII.,"Ourselves, deliver’d, may escape the sword,"
6642,BOOK VIII.,Nor let their foes thus tread the Grecians down!
6643,BOOK VIII.,He said. The eternal father pitying saw280
6644,BOOK VIII.,"His tears, and for the monarch’s sake preserved"
6645,BOOK VIII.,"The people. Instant, surest of all signs,"
6646,BOOK VIII.,He sent his eagle; in his pounces strong
6647,BOOK VIII.,"A fawn he bore, fruit of the nimble hind,"
6648,BOOK VIII.,Which fast beside the beauteous altar raised285
6649,BOOK VIII.,To Panomphæan[12] Jove sudden he dropp’d.[13]
6650,BOOK VIII.,"They, conscious, soon, that sent from Jove he came,"
6651,BOOK VIII.,More ardent sprang to fight. Then none of all
6652,BOOK VIII.,Those numerous Chiefs could boast that he outstripp’d
6653,BOOK VIII.,"Tydides, urging forth beyond the foss290"
6654,BOOK VIII.,"His rapid steeds, and rushing to the war."
6655,BOOK VIII.,"He, foremost far, a Trojan slew, the son"
6656,BOOK VIII.,"Of Phradmon, Ageläus; as he turn’d"
6657,BOOK VIII.,"His steeds to flight, him turning with his spear"
6658,BOOK VIII.,Through back and bosom Diomede transpierced.295
6659,BOOK VIII.,And with loud clangor of his arms he fell.
6660,BOOK VIII.,"Then, royal Agamemnon pass’d the trench"
6661,BOOK VIII.,"And Menelaus; either Ajax, then,"
6662,BOOK VIII.,"Clad with fresh prowess both; them follow’d, next,"
6663,BOOK VIII.,"Idomeneus, with his heroic friend300"
6664,BOOK VIII.,"In battle dread as homicidal Mars,"
6665,BOOK VIII.,Meriones; Evæmon’s son renown’d
6666,BOOK VIII.,"Succeeded, bold Eurypylus; and ninth"
6667,BOOK VIII.,"Teucer, wide-straining his impatient bow."
6668,BOOK VIII.,He under covert fought of the broad shield305
6669,BOOK VIII.,Of Telamonian Ajax; Ajax high
6670,BOOK VIII.,Upraised his shield; the hero from beneath
6671,BOOK VIII.,"Took aim, and whom his arrow struck, he fell;"
6672,BOOK VIII.,Then close as to his mother’s side a child
6673,BOOK VIII.,"For safety creeps, Teucer to Ajax’ side310"
6674,BOOK VIII.,"Retired, and Ajax shielded him again."
6675,BOOK VIII.,"Whom then slew Teucer first, illustrious Chief?"
6676,BOOK VIII.,"Orsilochus, and Ophelestes, first,"
6677,BOOK VIII.,"And Ormenus he slew, then Dætor died,"
6678,BOOK VIII.,Chromius and Lycophontes brave in fight315
6679,BOOK VIII.,"With Amopaon Polyæmon’s son,"
6680,BOOK VIII.,"And Melanippus. These, together heap’d,"
6681,BOOK VIII.,All fell by Teucer on the plain of Troy.
6682,BOOK VIII.,The Trojan ranks thinn’d by his mighty bow
6683,BOOK VIII.,The King of armies Agamemnon saw320
6684,BOOK VIII.,"Well-pleased, and him approaching, thus began."
6685,BOOK VIII.,"Brave Telamonian Teucer, oh, my friend,"
6686,BOOK VIII.,"Thus shoot, that light may visit once again"
6687,BOOK VIII.,"The Danaï, and Telamon rejoice!"
6688,BOOK VIII.,Thee Telamon within his own abode325
6689,BOOK VIII.,"Rear’d although spurious; mount him, in return,"
6690,BOOK VIII.,"Although remote, on glory’s heights again."
6691,BOOK VIII.,"I tell thee, and the effect shall follow sure,"
6692,BOOK VIII.,Let but the Thunderer and Minerva grant
6693,BOOK VIII.,"The pillage of fair Ilium to the Greeks,330"
6694,BOOK VIII.,"And I will give to thy victorious hand,"
6695,BOOK VIII.,"After my own, the noblest recompense,"
6696,BOOK VIII.,"A tripod or a chariot with its steeds,"
6697,BOOK VIII.,Or some fair captive to partake thy bed.
6698,BOOK VIII.,To whom the generous Teucer thus replied.335
6699,BOOK VIII.,Atrides! glorious monarch! wherefore me
6700,BOOK VIII.,Exhortest thou to battle? who myself
6701,BOOK VIII.,"Glow with sufficient ardor, and such strength"
6702,BOOK VIII.,As heaven affords me spare not to employ.
6703,BOOK VIII.,"Since first we drove them back, with watchful eye340"
6704,BOOK VIII.,Their warriors I have mark’d; eight shafts my bow
6705,BOOK VIII.,"Hath sent long-barb’d, and every shaft, well-aim’d."
6706,BOOK VIII.,The body of some Trojan youth robust
6707,BOOK VIII.,"Hath pierced, but still you ravening wolf escapes."
6708,BOOK VIII.,"He said, and from the nerve another shaft345"
6709,BOOK VIII.,Impatient sent at Hector; but it flew
6710,BOOK VIII.,"Devious, and brave Gorgythion struck instead."
6711,BOOK VIII.,"Him beautiful Castianira, brought"
6712,BOOK VIII.,"By Priam from Æsyma, nymph of form"
6713,BOOK VIII.,"Celestial, to the King of Ilium bore.350"
6714,BOOK VIII.,"As in the garden, with the weight surcharged"
6715,BOOK VIII.,"Of its own fruit, and drench’d by vernal rains"
6716,BOOK VIII.,"The poppy falls oblique, so he his head"
6717,BOOK VIII.,"Hung languid, by his helmet’s weight depress’d.[14]"
6718,BOOK VIII.,Then Teucer yet an arrow from the nerve355
6719,BOOK VIII.,"Dispatch’d at Hector, with impatience fired"
6720,BOOK VIII.,To pierce him; but again his weapon err’d
6721,BOOK VIII.,"Turn’d by Apollo, and the bosom struck"
6722,BOOK VIII.,"Of Archeptolemus, his rapid steeds"
6723,BOOK VIII.,"To battle urging, Hector’s charioteer.360"
6724,BOOK VIII.,"He fell, his fiery coursers at the sound"
6725,BOOK VIII.,"Recoil’d, and lifeless where he fell he lay."
6726,BOOK VIII.,Deep sorrow for his charioteer the mind
6727,BOOK VIII.,"O’erwhelm’d of Hector, yet he left the slain,"
6728,BOOK VIII.,"And seeing his own brother nigh at hand,365"
6729,BOOK VIII.,"Cebriones, him summon’d to the reins,"
6730,BOOK VIII.,Who with alacrity that charge received.
6731,BOOK VIII.,"Then Hector, leaping with a dreadful shout"
6732,BOOK VIII.,"From his resplendent chariot, grasp’d a stone,"
6733,BOOK VIII.,"And rush’d on Teucer, vengeance in his heart.370"
6734,BOOK VIII.,Teucer had newly fitted to the nerve
6735,BOOK VIII.,"An arrow keen selected from the rest,"
6736,BOOK VIII.,"And warlike Hector, while he stood the cord"
6737,BOOK VIII.,"Retracting, smote him with that rugged rock"
6738,BOOK VIII.,Just where the key-bone interposed divides375
6739,BOOK VIII.,"The neck and bosom, a most mortal part."
6740,BOOK VIII.,"It snapp’d the bow-string, and with numbing force"
6741,BOOK VIII.,"Struck dead his hand; low on his knees he dropp’d,"
6742,BOOK VIII.,And from his opening grasp let fall the bow.
6743,BOOK VIII.,Then not unmindful of a brother fallen380
6744,BOOK VIII.,"Was Ajax, but, advancing rapid, stalk’d"
6745,BOOK VIII.,"Around him, and his broad shield interposed,"
6746,BOOK VIII.,"Till brave Alaster and Mecisteus, son"
6747,BOOK VIII.,"Of Echius, friends of Teucer, from the earth"
6748,BOOK VIII.,Upraised and bore him groaning to the fleet.385
6749,BOOK VIII.,And now again fresh force Olympian Jove
6750,BOOK VIII.,Gave to the Trojans; right toward the foss
6751,BOOK VIII.,"They drove the Greeks, while Hector in the van"
6752,BOOK VIII.,"Advanced, death menacing in every look."
6753,BOOK VIII.,As some fleet hound close-threatening flank or haunch390
6754,BOOK VIII.,"Of boar or lion, oft as he his head"
6755,BOOK VIII.,"Turns flying, marks him with a steadfast eye,"
6756,BOOK VIII.,"So Hector chased the Grecians, slaying still"
6757,BOOK VIII.,The hindmost of the scatter’d multitude.
6758,BOOK VIII.,"But when, at length, both piles and hollow foss395"
6759,BOOK VIII.,"They had surmounted, and no few had fallen"
6760,BOOK VIII.,"By Trojan hands, within their fleet they stood"
6761,BOOK VIII.,"Imprison’d, calling each to each, and prayer"
6762,BOOK VIII.,"With lifted hands, loud offering to the Gods."
6763,BOOK VIII.,"With Gorgon looks, meantime, and eyes of Mars,400"
6764,BOOK VIII.,Hector impetuous his mane-tossing steeds
6765,BOOK VIII.,"From side to side before the rampart drove,"
6766,BOOK VIII.,"When white-arm’d Juno pitying the Greeks,"
6767,BOOK VIII.,In accents wing’d her speech to Pallas turn’d.
6768,BOOK VIII.,"Alas, Jove’s daughter! shall not we at least405"
6769,BOOK VIII.,In this extremity of their distress
6770,BOOK VIII.,Care for the Grecians by the fatal force
6771,BOOK VIII.,Of this one Chief destroy’d? I can endure
6772,BOOK VIII.,The rage of Priameïan Hector now
6773,BOOK VIII.,No longer; such dire mischiefs he hath wrought.410
6774,BOOK VIII.,"Whom answer’d thus Pallas, cærulean-eyed."
6775,BOOK VIII.,—And Hector had himself long since his life
6776,BOOK VIII.,"Resign’d and rage together, by the Greeks"
6777,BOOK VIII.,"Slain under Ilium’s walls, but Jove, my sire,"
6778,BOOK VIII.,"Mad counsels executing and perverse,415"
6779,BOOK VIII.,"Me counterworks in all that I attempt,"
6780,BOOK VIII.,Nor aught remembers how I saved ofttimes
6781,BOOK VIII.,His son enjoin’d full many a task severe
6782,BOOK VIII.,"By King Eurystheus; to the Gods he wept,"
6783,BOOK VIII.,And me Jove sent in haste to his relief.420
6784,BOOK VIII.,"But had I then foreseen what now I know,"
6785,BOOK VIII.,When through the adamantine gates he pass’d
6786,BOOK VIII.,"To bind the dog of hell, by the deep floods"
6787,BOOK VIII.,"Hemm’d in of Styx, he had return’d no more."
6788,BOOK VIII.,"But Thetis wins him now; her will prevails,425"
6789,BOOK VIII.,And mine he hates; for she hath kiss’d his knees
6790,BOOK VIII.,"And grasp’d his beard, and him in prayer implored"
6791,BOOK VIII.,That he would honor her heroic son
6792,BOOK VIII.,"Achilles, city-waster prince renown’d."
6793,BOOK VIII.,’Tis well—the day shall come when Jove again430
6794,BOOK VIII.,"Shall call me darling, and his blue-eyed maid"
6795,BOOK VIII.,"As heretofore;—but thou thy steeds prepare,"
6796,BOOK VIII.,"While I, my father’s mansion entering, arm"
6797,BOOK VIII.,"For battle. I would learn by trial sure,"
6798,BOOK VIII.,"If Hector, Priam’s offspring famed in fight435"
6799,BOOK VIII.,(Ourselves appearing in the walks of war)
6800,BOOK VIII.,Will greet us gladly. Doubtless at the fleet
6801,BOOK VIII.,"Some Trojan also, shall to dogs resign"
6802,BOOK VIII.,"His flesh for food, and to the fowls of heaven."
6803,BOOK VIII.,
6804,BOOK VIII.,"So counsell’d Pallas, nor the daughter dread440"
6805,BOOK VIII.,"Of mighty Saturn, Juno, disapproved,"
6806,BOOK VIII.,But busily and with dispatch prepared
6807,BOOK VIII.,The trappings of her coursers golden-rein’d.
6808,BOOK VIII.,"Meantime, Minerva progeny of Jove,"
6809,BOOK VIII.,On the adamantine floor of his abode445
6810,BOOK VIII.,"Let fall profuse her variegated robe,"
6811,BOOK VIII.,Labor of her own hands. She first put on
6812,BOOK VIII.,"The corslet of the cloud-assembler God,"
6813,BOOK VIII.,"Then arm’d her for the field of wo, complete."
6814,BOOK VIII.,"Mounting the fiery chariot, next she seized450"
6815,BOOK VIII.,"Her ponderous spear, huge, irresistible,"
6816,BOOK VIII.,With which Jove’s awful daughter levels ranks
6817,BOOK VIII.,Of heroes against whom her anger burns.
6818,BOOK VIII.,Juno with lifted lash urged on the steeds.
6819,BOOK VIII.,"At their approach, spontaneous roar’d the wide-455"
6820,BOOK VIII.,Unfolding gates of heaven; the heavenly gates
6821,BOOK VIII.,"Kept by the watchful Hours, to whom the charge"
6822,BOOK VIII.,"Of the Olympian summit appertains,"
6823,BOOK VIII.,"And of the boundless ether, back to roll,"
6824,BOOK VIII.,And to replace the cloudy barrier dense.460
6825,BOOK VIII.,Spurr’d through the portal flew the rapid steeds:
6826,BOOK VIII.,Which when the Eternal Father from the heights
6827,BOOK VIII.,"Of Ida saw, kindling with instant ire"
6828,BOOK VIII.,To golden-pinion’d Iris thus he spake.
6829,BOOK VIII.,"Haste, Iris, turn them thither whence they came;465"
6830,BOOK VIII.,Me let them not encounter; honor small
6831,BOOK VIII.,"To them, to me, should from that strife accrue."
6832,BOOK VIII.,"Tell them, and the effect shall sure ensue,"
6833,BOOK VIII.,"That I will smite their steeds, and they shall halt"
6834,BOOK VIII.,"Disabled; break their chariot, dash themselves470"
6835,BOOK VIII.,"Headlong, and ten whole years shall not efface"
6836,BOOK VIII.,The wounds by my avenging bolts impress’d.
6837,BOOK VIII.,So shall my blue-eyed daughter learn to dread
6838,BOOK VIII.,A father’s anger; but for the offence
6839,BOOK VIII.,"Of Juno, I resent it less; for she475"
6840,BOOK VIII.,Clashes[15] with all my counsels from of old.
6841,BOOK VIII.,He ended; Iris with a tempest’s speed
6842,BOOK VIII.,From the Idæan summit soar’d at once
6843,BOOK VIII.,To the Olympian; at the open gates
6844,BOOK VIII.,Exterior of the mountain many-valed480
6845,BOOK VIII.,"She stayed them, and her coming thus declared."
6846,BOOK VIII.,"Whither, and for what cause? What rage is this?"
6847,BOOK VIII.,Ye may not aid the Grecians; Jove forbids;
6848,BOOK VIII.,"The son of Saturn threatens, if ye force"
6849,BOOK VIII.,"His wrath by perseverance into act,485"
6850,BOOK VIII.,"That he will smite your steeds, and they shall halt"
6851,BOOK VIII.,"Disabled; break your chariot, dash yourselves"
6852,BOOK VIII.,"Headlong, and ten whole years shall not efface"
6853,BOOK VIII.,The wounds by his avenging bolts impress’d.
6854,BOOK VIII.,So shall his blue-eyed daughter learn to dread490
6855,BOOK VIII.,A father’s anger; but for the offence
6856,BOOK VIII.,"Of Juno, he resents it less; for she"
6857,BOOK VIII.,Clashes with all his counsels from of old.
6858,BOOK VIII.,"But thou, Minerva, if thou dare indeed"
6859,BOOK VIII.,"Lift thy vast spear against the breast of Jove,495"
6860,BOOK VIII.,Incorrigible art and dead to shame.
6861,BOOK VIII.,"So saying, the rapid Iris disappear’d,"
6862,BOOK VIII.,And thus her speech to Pallas Juno turn’d.
6863,BOOK VIII.,"Ah Pallas, progeny of Jove! henceforth"
6864,BOOK VIII.,"No longer, in the cause of mortal men,500"
6865,BOOK VIII.,Contend we against Jove. Perish or live
6866,BOOK VIII.,Grecians or Trojans as he wills; let him
6867,BOOK VIII.,"Dispose the order of his own concerns,"
6868,BOOK VIII.,"And judge between them, as of right he may."
6869,BOOK VIII.,"So saying, she turn’d the coursers; them the Hours505"
6870,BOOK VIII.,"Released, and to ambrosial mangers bound,"
6871,BOOK VIII.,Then thrust their chariot to the luminous wall.
6872,BOOK VIII.,"They, mingling with the Gods, on golden thrones"
6873,BOOK VIII.,"Dejected sat, and Jove from Ida borne"
6874,BOOK VIII.,"Reach’d the Olympian heights, seat of the Gods.510"
6875,BOOK VIII.,"His steeds the glorious King of Ocean loosed,"
6876,BOOK VIII.,"And thrust the chariot, with its veil o’erspread."
6877,BOOK VIII.,Into its station at the altar’s side.
6878,BOOK VIII.,Then sat the Thunderer on his throne of gold
6879,BOOK VIII.,"Himself, and the huge mountain shook. Meantime515"
6880,BOOK VIII.,"Juno and Pallas, seated both apart,"
6881,BOOK VIII.,Spake not or question’d him. Their mute reserve
6882,BOOK VIII.,"He noticed, conscious of the cause, and said."
6883,BOOK VIII.,"Juno and Pallas, wherefore sit ye sad?"
6884,BOOK VIII.,Not through fatigue by glorious fight incurr’d520
6885,BOOK VIII.,And slaughter of the Trojans whom ye hate.
6886,BOOK VIII.,Mark now the difference. Not the Gods combined
6887,BOOK VIII.,"Should have constrain’d _me_ back, till all my force,"
6888,BOOK VIII.,"Superior as it is, had fail’d, and all"
6889,BOOK VIII.,"My fortitude. But ye, ere ye beheld525"
6890,BOOK VIII.,"The wonders of the field, trembling retired."
6891,BOOK VIII.,And ye did well—Hear what had else befallen.
6892,BOOK VIII.,"My bolts had found you both, and ye had reach’d,"
6893,BOOK VIII.,"In your own chariot borne, the Olympian height,"
6894,BOOK VIII.,"Seat of the blest Immortals, never more.530"
6895,BOOK VIII.,He ended; Juno and Minerva heard
6896,BOOK VIII.,"Low murmuring deep disgust, and side by side"
6897,BOOK VIII.,Devising sat calamity to Troy.
6898,BOOK VIII.,"Minerva, through displeasure against Jove,"
6899,BOOK VIII.,"Nought utter’d, for her bosom boil’d with rage;535"
6900,BOOK VIII.,"But Juno check’d not hers, who thus replied."
6901,BOOK VIII.,"What word hath pass’d thy lips, Jove most severe?"
6902,BOOK VIII.,We know thy force resistless; yet our hearts
6903,BOOK VIII.,Feel not the less when we behold the Greeks
6904,BOOK VIII.,Exhausting all the sorrows of their lot.540
6905,BOOK VIII.,"If thou command, we doubtless will abstain"
6906,BOOK VIII.,"From battle, yet such counsel to the Greeks"
6907,BOOK VIII.,"Suggesting still, as may in part effect"
6908,BOOK VIII.,"Their safety, lest thy wrath consume them all."
6909,BOOK VIII.,"Then answer, thus, cloud-gatherer Jove return’d.545"
6910,BOOK VIII.,"Look forth, imperial Juno, if thou wilt,"
6911,BOOK VIII.,"To-morrow at the blush of earliest dawn,"
6912,BOOK VIII.,And thou shalt see Saturn’s almighty son
6913,BOOK VIII.,The Argive host destroying far and wide.
6914,BOOK VIII.,For Hector’s fury shall admit no pause550
6915,BOOK VIII.,"Till he have roused Achilles, in that day"
6916,BOOK VIII.,"When at the ships, in perilous straits, the hosts"
6917,BOOK VIII.,Shall wage fierce battle for Patroclus slain.
6918,BOOK VIII.,"Such is the voice of fate. But, as for thee—"
6919,BOOK VIII.,Withdraw thou to the confines of the abyss555
6920,BOOK VIII.,"Where Saturn and Iäpetus retired,"
6921,BOOK VIII.,Exclusion sad endure from balmy airs
6922,BOOK VIII.,"And from the light of morn, hell-girt around,"
6923,BOOK VIII.,I will not call thee thence. No. Should thy rage
6924,BOOK VIII.,"Transport thee thither, there thou may’st abide,560"
6925,BOOK VIII.,There sullen nurse thy disregarded spleen
6926,BOOK VIII.,"Obstinate as thou art, and void of shame."
6927,BOOK VIII.,He ended; to whom Juno nought replied.
6928,BOOK VIII.,"And now the radiant Sun in Ocean sank,"
6929,BOOK VIII.,Drawing night after him o’er all the earth;565
6930,BOOK VIII.,"Night, undesired by Troy, but to the Greeks"
6931,BOOK VIII.,Thrice welcome for its interposing gloom.
6932,BOOK VIII.,Then Hector on the river’s brink fast by
6933,BOOK VIII.,"The Grecian fleet, where space he found unstrew’d"
6934,BOOK VIII.,With carcases convened the Chiefs of Troy.570
6935,BOOK VIII.,"They, there dismounting, listen’d to the words"
6936,BOOK VIII.,Of Hector Jove-beloved; he grasp’d a spear
6937,BOOK VIII.,"In length eleven cubits, bright its head"
6938,BOOK VIII.,"Of brass, and color’d with a ring of gold."
6939,BOOK VIII.,"He lean’d on it, and ardent thus began.575"
6940,BOOK VIII.,"Trojans, Dardanians, and allies of Troy!"
6941,BOOK VIII.,"I hoped, this evening (every ship consumed,"
6942,BOOK VIII.,And all the Grecians slain) to have return’d
6943,BOOK VIII.,To wind-swept Ilium. But the shades of night
6944,BOOK VIII.,"Have intervened, and to the night they owe,580"
6945,BOOK VIII.,"In chief, their whole fleet’s safety and their own."
6946,BOOK VIII.,"Now, therefore, as the night enjoins, all take"
6947,BOOK VIII.,Needful refreshment. Your high-mettled steeds
6948,BOOK VIII.,"Release, lay food before them, and in haste"
6949,BOOK VIII.,Drive hither from the city fatted sheep585
6950,BOOK VIII.,"And oxen; bring ye from your houses bread,"
6951,BOOK VIII.,"Make speedy purchase of heart-cheering wine,"
6952,BOOK VIII.,"And gather fuel plenteous; that all night,"
6953,BOOK VIII.,"E’en till Aurora, daughter of the morn"
6954,BOOK VIII.,"Shall look abroad, we may with many fires590"
6955,BOOK VIII.,"Illume the skies; lest even in the night,"
6956,BOOK VIII.,"Launching, they mount the billows and escape."
6957,BOOK VIII.,"Beware that they depart not unannoy’d,"
6958,BOOK VIII.,"But, as he leaps on board, give each a wound"
6959,BOOK VIII.,"With shaft or spear, which he shall nurse at home.595"
6960,BOOK VIII.,"So shall the nations fear us, and shall vex"
6961,BOOK VIII.,With ruthless war Troy’s gallant sons no more.
6962,BOOK VIII.,"Next, let the heralds, ministers of Jove,"
6963,BOOK VIII.,"Loud notice issue that the boys well-grown,"
6964,BOOK VIII.,And ancients silver-hair’d on the high towers600
6965,BOOK VIII.,"Built by the Gods, keep watch; on every hearth"
6966,BOOK VIII.,"In Troy, let those of the inferior sex"
6967,BOOK VIII.,"Make sprightly blaze, and place ye there a guard"
6968,BOOK VIII.,"Sufficient, lest in absence of the troops"
6969,BOOK VIII.,"An ambush enter, and surprise the town.605"
6970,BOOK VIII.,"Act thus, ye dauntless Trojans; the advice"
6971,BOOK VIII.,"Is wholesome, and shall serve the present need,"
6972,BOOK VIII.,And so much for the night; ye shall be told
6973,BOOK VIII.,The business of the morn when morn appears.
6974,BOOK VIII.,It is my prayer to Jove and to all heaven610
6975,BOOK VIII.,(Not without hope) that I may hence expel
6976,BOOK VIII.,"These dogs, whom Ilium’s unpropitious fates"
6977,BOOK VIII.,Have wafted hither in their sable barks.
6978,BOOK VIII.,"But we will also watch this night, ourselves,"
6979,BOOK VIII.,"And, arming with the dawn, will at their ships615"
6980,BOOK VIII.,Give them brisk onset. Then shall it appear
6981,BOOK VIII.,If Diomede the brave shall me compel
6982,BOOK VIII.,"Back to our walls, or I, his arms blood-stain’d,"
6983,BOOK VIII.,"Torn from his breathless body, bear away."
6984,BOOK VIII.,"To-morrow, if he dare but to abide620"
6985,BOOK VIII.,"My lance, he shall not want occasion meet"
6986,BOOK VIII.,For show of valor. But much more I judge
6987,BOOK VIII.,That the next rising sun shall see him slain
6988,BOOK VIII.,With no few friends around him. Would to heaven!
6989,BOOK VIII.,I were as sure to ’scape the blight of age625
6990,BOOK VIII.,"And share their honors with the Gods above,"
6991,BOOK VIII.,As comes the morrow fraught with wo to Greece.
6992,BOOK VIII.,"So Hector, whom his host with loud acclaim"
6993,BOOK VIII.,"All praised. Then each his sweating steeds released,"
6994,BOOK VIII.,And rein’d them safely at his chariot-side.630
6995,BOOK VIII.,"And now from Troy provision large they brought,"
6996,BOOK VIII.,"Oxen, and sheep, with store of wine and bread,"
6997,BOOK VIII.,And fuel much was gather’d. [16]Next the Gods
6998,BOOK VIII.,"With sacrifice they sought, and from the plain"
6999,BOOK VIII.,Upwafted by the winds the smoke aspired635
7000,BOOK VIII.,"Savoury, but unacceptable to those"
7001,BOOK VIII.,Above; such hatred in their hearts they bore
7002,BOOK VIII.,"To Priam, to the people of the brave"
7003,BOOK VIII.,"Spear-practised Priam, and to sacred Troy."
7004,BOOK VIII.,"Big with great purposes and proud, they sat,640"
7005,BOOK VIII.,"Not disarray’d, but in fair form disposed"
7006,BOOK VIII.,"Of even ranks, and watch’d their numerous fires,"
7007,BOOK VIII.,"As when around the clear bright moon, the stars"
7008,BOOK VIII.,"Shine in full splendor, and the winds are hush’d,"
7009,BOOK VIII.,"The groves, the mountain-tops, the headland-heights645"
7010,BOOK VIII.,"Stand all apparent, not a vapor streaks"
7011,BOOK VIII.,"The boundless blue, but ether open’d wide"
7012,BOOK VIII.,"All glitters, and the shepherd’s heart is cheer’d;[17]"
7013,BOOK VIII.,So numerous seem’d those fires the bank between
7014,BOOK VIII.,"Of Xanthus, blazing, and the fleet of Greece,650"
7015,BOOK VIII.,"In prospect all of Troy; a thousand fires,"
7016,BOOK VIII.,Each watch’d by fifty warriors seated near.
7017,BOOK VIII.,"The steeds beside the chariots stood, their corn"

7063,BOOK IX.,Commands me back inglorious to the shores

7076,BOOK IX.,"And with such freedom as the laws, O King!"
7077,BOOK IX.,Of consultation and debate allow.40
7078,BOOK IX.,Hear patient. Thou hast been thyself the first
7079,BOOK IX.,Who e’er reproach’d me in the public ear
7080,BOOK IX.,As one effeminate and slow to fight;
7081,BOOK IX.,"How truly, let both young and old decide."
7082,BOOK IX.,The son of wily Saturn hath to thee45
7083,BOOK IX.,"Given, and refused; he placed thee high in power,"
7084,BOOK IX.,"Gave thee to sway the sceptre o’er us all,"
7085,BOOK IX.,"But courage gave thee not, his noblest gift.[2]"
7086,BOOK IX.,Art thou in truth persuaded that the Greeks

7088,BOOK IX.,"If thy own fears impel thee to depart,"
7089,BOOK IX.,"Go thou, the way is open; numerous ships,"
7090,BOOK IX.,"Thy followers from Mycenæ, line the shore."

7105,BOOK IX.,"Thy father, thou should’st be my latest born."
7106,BOOK IX.,"Yet when thy speech is to the Kings of Greece,"
7107,BOOK IX.,It is well-framed and prudent. Now attend!70

7117,BOOK IX.,And let the guard be stationed at the trench80
7118,BOOK IX.,Without the wall; the youngest shall supply
7119,BOOK IX.,"That service; next, Atrides, thou begin"
7120,BOOK IX.,(For thou art here supreme) thy proper task.
7121,BOOK IX.,Banquet the elders; it shall not disgrace

7133,BOOK IX.,Forth rush’d the guard well-arm’d; first went the son
7134,BOOK IX.,"Of Nestor, Thrasymedes, valiant Chief;"
7135,BOOK IX.,"Then, sons of Mars, Ascalaphus advanced,"
7136,BOOK IX.,And brave Iälmenus; whom follow’d next
7137,BOOK IX.,"Deipyrus, Aphareus, Meriones,100"
7138,BOOK IX.,"And Lycomedes, Creon’s son renown’d."
7139,BOOK IX.,"Seven were the leaders of the guard, and each"
7140,BOOK IX.,"A hundred spearmen headed, young and bold."
7141,BOOK IX.,"Between the wall and trench their seat they chose,"
7142,BOOK IX.,"There kindled fires, and each his food prepared.105"
7143,BOOK IX.,"Atrides, then, to his pavilion led"
7144,BOOK IX.,"The thronging Chiefs of Greece, and at his board"
7145,BOOK IX.,Regaled them; they with readiness and keen
7146,BOOK IX.,"Dispatch of hunger shared the savory feast,"
7147,BOOK IX.,And when nor thirst remain’d nor hunger more110
7148,BOOK IX.,"Unsated, Nestor then, arising first,"
7149,BOOK IX.,"Whose counsels had been ever wisest deem’d,"
7150,BOOK IX.,"Warm for the public interest, thus began."
7151,BOOK IX.,Atrides! glorious sovereign! King of men!
7152,BOOK IX.,"Thou art my first and last, proem and close,115"
7153,BOOK IX.,"For thou art mighty, and to thee are given"
7154,BOOK IX.,"From Jove the sceptre and the laws in charge,"
7155,BOOK IX.,For the advancement of the general good.
7156,BOOK IX.,"Hence, in peculiar, both to speak and hear"
7157,BOOK IX.,"Become thy duty, and the best advice,120"
7158,BOOK IX.,"By whomsoever offer’d, to adopt"
7159,BOOK IX.,"And to perform, for thou art judge alone."
7160,BOOK IX.,I will promulge the counsel which to me
7161,BOOK IX.,"Seems wisest; such, that other Grecian none"
7162,BOOK IX.,"Shall give thee better; neither is it new,125"
7163,BOOK IX.,But I have ever held it since the day
7164,BOOK IX.,"When, most illustrious! thou wast pleased to take"
7165,BOOK IX.,By force the maid Briseïs from the tent
7166,BOOK IX.,"Of the enraged Achilles; not, in truth,"
7167,BOOK IX.,"By my advice, who did dissuade thee much;130"
7168,BOOK IX.,"But thou, complying with thy princely wrath,"
7169,BOOK IX.,Hast shamed a Hero whom themselves the Gods
7170,BOOK IX.,"Delight to honor, and his prize detain’st."
7171,BOOK IX.,"Yet even now contrive we, although late,"
7172,BOOK IX.,"By lenient gifts liberal, and by speech135"
7173,BOOK IX.,"Conciliatory, to assuage his ire."
7174,BOOK IX.,"Then answer’d Agamemnon, King of men."
7175,BOOK IX.,Old Chief! there is no falsehood in thy charge;
7176,BOOK IX.,"I have offended, and confess the wrong."
7177,BOOK IX.,"The warrior is alone a host, whom Jove140"
7178,BOOK IX.,"Loves as he loves Achilles, for whose sake"
7179,BOOK IX.,He hath Achaia’s thousands thus subdued.
7180,BOOK IX.,But if the impulse of a wayward mind
7181,BOOK IX.,"Obeying, I have err’d, behold me, now,"
7182,BOOK IX.,Prepared to soothe him with atonement large145
7183,BOOK IX.,"Of gifts inestimable, which by name"
7184,BOOK IX.,I will propound in presence of you all.
7185,BOOK IX.,"Seven tripods, never sullied yet with fire;"
7186,BOOK IX.,Of gold ten talents; twenty cauldrons bright;
7187,BOOK IX.,"Twelve coursers, strong, victorious in the race;150"
7188,BOOK IX.,No man possessing prizes such as mine
7189,BOOK IX.,"Which they have won for me, shall feel the want"
7190,BOOK IX.,Of acquisitions splendid or of gold.
7191,BOOK IX.,Seven virtuous female captives will I give
7192,BOOK IX.,"Expert in arts domestic, Lesbians all,155"
7193,BOOK IX.,"Whom, when himself took Lesbos, I received"
7194,BOOK IX.,"My chosen portion, passing womankind"
7195,BOOK IX.,In perfect loveliness of face and form.
7196,BOOK IX.,"These will I give, and will with these resign"
7197,BOOK IX.,"Her whom I took, Briseïs, with an oath160"
7198,BOOK IX.,"Most solemn, that unconscious as she was"
7199,BOOK IX.,"Of my embraces, such I yield her his."
7200,BOOK IX.,All these I give him now; and if at length
7201,BOOK IX.,The Gods vouchsafe to us to overturn
7202,BOOK IX.,"Priam’s great city, let him heap his ships165"
7203,BOOK IX.,"With gold and brass, entering and choosing first"
7204,BOOK IX.,When we shall share the spoil. Let him beside
7205,BOOK IX.,"Choose twenty from among the maids of Troy,"
7206,BOOK IX.,"Helen except, loveliest of all their sex."
7207,BOOK IX.,"And if once more, the rich milk-flowing land170"
7208,BOOK IX.,"We reach of Argos, he shall there become"
7209,BOOK IX.,"My son-in-law, and shall enjoy like state"
7210,BOOK IX.,"With him whom I in all abundance rear,"
7211,BOOK IX.,My only son Orestes. At my home
7212,BOOK IX.,I have three daughters; let him thence conduct175
7213,BOOK IX.,"To Phthia, her whom he shall most approve."
7214,BOOK IX.,"Chrysothemis shall be his bride, or else"
7215,BOOK IX.,"Laodice; or if she please him more,"
7216,BOOK IX.,Iphianassa; and from him I ask
7217,BOOK IX.,No dower;[5] myself will such a dower bestow180
7218,BOOK IX.,As never father on his child before.
7219,BOOK IX.,Seven fair well-peopled cities I will give
7220,BOOK IX.,"Cardamyle and Enope, and rich"
7221,BOOK IX.,"In herbage, Hira; Pheræ stately-built,"
7222,BOOK IX.,And for her depth of pasturage renown’d185
7223,BOOK IX.,"Antheia; proud Æpeia’s lofty towers,"
7224,BOOK IX.,And Pedasus impurpled dark with vines.
7225,BOOK IX.,"All these are maritime, and on the shore"
7226,BOOK IX.,"They stand of Pylus, by a race possess’d"
7227,BOOK IX.,"Most rich in flocks and herds, who tributes large,190"
7228,BOOK IX.,"And gifts presenting to his sceptred hand,"
7229,BOOK IX.,Shall hold him high in honor as a God.
7230,BOOK IX.,These will I give him if from wrath he cease.
7231,BOOK IX.,Let him be overcome. Pluto alone
7232,BOOK IX.,"Is found implacable and deaf to prayer,195"
7233,BOOK IX.,Whom therefore of all Gods men hate the most.
7234,BOOK IX.,"My power is greater, and my years than his"
7235,BOOK IX.,"More numerous, therefore let him yield to me."
7236,BOOK IX.,To him Gerenian Nestor thus replied.
7237,BOOK IX.,Atrides! glorious sovereign! King of men!200
7238,BOOK IX.,"No sordid gifts, or to be view’d with scorn,"
7239,BOOK IX.,Givest thou the Prince Achilles. But away!
7240,BOOK IX.,"Send chosen messengers, who shall the son"
7241,BOOK IX.,"Of Peleus, instant, in his tent address."
7242,BOOK IX.,"Myself will choose them, be it theirs to obey.205"
7243,BOOK IX.,"Let Phœnix lead, Jove loves him. Be the next"
7244,BOOK IX.,Huge Ajax; and the wise Ulysses third.
7245,BOOK IX.,"Of heralds, Odius and Eurybates"
7246,BOOK IX.,Shall them attend. Bring water for our hands;
7247,BOOK IX.,Give charge that every tongue abstain from speech210
7248,BOOK IX.,"Portentous, and propitiate Jove by prayer."
7249,BOOK IX.,"He spake, and all were pleased. The heralds pour’d"
7250,BOOK IX.,Pure water on their hands;[6] attendant youths
7251,BOOK IX.,"The beakers crown’d, and wine from right to left"
7252,BOOK IX.,"Distributed to all. Libation made,215"
7253,BOOK IX.,"All drank, and in such measure as they chose,"
7254,BOOK IX.,Then hasted forth from Agamemnon’s tent.
7255,BOOK IX.,Gerenian Nestor at their side them oft
7256,BOOK IX.,"Instructed, each admonishing by looks"
7257,BOOK IX.,"Significant, and motion of his eyes,220"
7258,BOOK IX.,"But most Ulysses, to omit no means"
7259,BOOK IX.,By which Achilles likeliest might be won.
7260,BOOK IX.,Along the margin of the sounding deep
7261,BOOK IX.,"They pass’d, to Neptune, compasser of earth,"
7262,BOOK IX.,"Preferring vows ardent with numerous prayers,225"
7263,BOOK IX.,That they might sway with ease the mighty mind
7264,BOOK IX.,Of fierce Æacides. And now they reach’d
7265,BOOK IX.,The station where his Myrmidons abode.
7266,BOOK IX.,Him solacing they found his heart with notes
7267,BOOK IX.,Struck from his silver-framed harmonious lyre;230
7268,BOOK IX.,Among the spoils he found it when he sack’d
7269,BOOK IX.,Eëtion’s city; with that lyre his cares
7270,BOOK IX.,"He sooth’d, and glorious heroes were his theme.[7]"
7271,BOOK IX.,"Patroclus silent sat, and he alone,"
7272,BOOK IX.,"Before him, on Æacides intent,235"
7273,BOOK IX.,Expecting still when he should cease to sing.
7274,BOOK IX.,The messengers advanced (Ulysses first)
7275,BOOK IX.,"Into his presence; at the sight, his harp"
7276,BOOK IX.,"Still in his hand, Achilles from his seat"
7277,BOOK IX.,Started astonish’d; nor with less amaze240
7278,BOOK IX.,"Patroclus also, seeing them, arose."
7279,BOOK IX.,"Achilles seized their hands, and thus he spake.[8]"
7280,BOOK IX.,
7281,BOOK IX.,Hail friends! ye all are welcome. Urgent cause
7282,BOOK IX.,"Hath doubtless brought you, whom I dearest hold"
7283,BOOK IX.,(Though angry still) of all Achaia’s host.245
7284,BOOK IX.,"So saying, he introduced them, and on seats"
7285,BOOK IX.,"Placed them with purple arras overspread,"
7286,BOOK IX.,Then thus bespake Patroclus standing nigh.
7287,BOOK IX.,Son of Menætius! bring a beaker more
7288,BOOK IX.,"Capacious, and replenish it with wine250"
7289,BOOK IX.,Diluted[9] less; then give to each his cup;
7290,BOOK IX.,For dearer friends than these who now arrive
7291,BOOK IX.,"My roof beneath, or worthier, have I none."
7292,BOOK IX.,"He ended, and Patroclus quick obey’d,"
7293,BOOK IX.,"Whom much he loved. Achilles, then, himself255"
7294,BOOK IX.,"Advancing near the fire an ample[10] tray,"
7295,BOOK IX.,"Spread goats’ flesh on it, with the flesh of sheep"
7296,BOOK IX.,And of a fatted brawn; of each a chine.
7297,BOOK IX.,"Automedon attending held them fast,"
7298,BOOK IX.,While with sharp steel Achilles from the bone260
7299,BOOK IX.,"Sliced thin the meat, then pierced it with the spits."
7300,BOOK IX.,Meantime the godlike Menætiades
7301,BOOK IX.,"Kindled fierce fire, and when the flame declined,"
7302,BOOK IX.,"Raked wide the embers, laid the meat to roast,"
7303,BOOK IX.,And taking sacred salt from the hearth-side265
7304,BOOK IX.,"Where it was treasured, shower’d it o’er the feast."
7305,BOOK IX.,"When all was finish’d, and the board set forth,"
7306,BOOK IX.,Patroclus furnish’d it around with bread
7307,BOOK IX.,"In baskets, and Achilles served the guests."
7308,BOOK IX.,"Beside the tent-wall, opposite, he sat270"
7309,BOOK IX.,To the divine Ulysses; first he bade
7310,BOOK IX.,Patroclus make oblation; he consign’d
7311,BOOK IX.,"The consecrated morsel to the fire,"
7312,BOOK IX.,"And each, at once, his savoury mess assail’d."
7313,BOOK IX.,When neither edge of hunger now they felt275
7314,BOOK IX.,"Nor thirsted longer, Ajax with a nod"
7315,BOOK IX.,"Made sign to Phœnix, which Ulysses mark’d,"
7316,BOOK IX.,"And charging high his cup, drank to his host."
7317,BOOK IX.,Health to Achilles! hospitable cheer
7318,BOOK IX.,"And well prepared, we want not at the board280"
7319,BOOK IX.,"Of royal Agamemnon, or at thine,"
7320,BOOK IX.,"For both are nobly spread; but dainties now,"
7321,BOOK IX.,"Or plenteous boards, are little our concern.[11]"
7322,BOOK IX.,Oh godlike Chief! tremendous ills we sit
7323,BOOK IX.,"Contemplating with fear, doubtful if life285"
7324,BOOK IX.,"Or death, with the destruction of our fleet,"
7325,BOOK IX.,"Attend us, unless thou put on thy might."
7326,BOOK IX.,"For lo! the haughty Trojans, with their friends"
7327,BOOK IX.,"Call’d from afar, at the fleet-side encamp,"
7328,BOOK IX.,"Fast by the wall, where they have kindled fires290"
7329,BOOK IX.,"Numerous, and threaten that no force of ours"
7330,BOOK IX.,Shall check their purposed inroad on the ships.
7331,BOOK IX.,"Jove grants them favorable signs from heaven,"
7332,BOOK IX.,"Bright lightnings; Hector glares revenge, with rage"
7333,BOOK IX.,"Infuriate, and by Jove assisted, heeds295"
7334,BOOK IX.,"Nor God nor man, but prays the morn to rise"
7335,BOOK IX.,"That he may hew away our vessel-heads,"
7336,BOOK IX.,"Burn all our fleet with fire, and at their sides"
7337,BOOK IX.,Slay the Achaians struggling in the smoke.
7338,BOOK IX.,Horrible are my fears lest these his threats300
7339,BOOK IX.,"The Gods accomplish, and it be our doom"
7340,BOOK IX.,"To perish here, from Argos far remote."
7341,BOOK IX.,"Up, therefore! if thou canst, and now at last"
7342,BOOK IX.,The weary sons of all Achaia save
7343,BOOK IX.,"From Trojan violence. Regret, but vain,305"
7344,BOOK IX.,"Shall else be thine hereafter, when no cure"
7345,BOOK IX.,"Of such great ill, once suffer’d, can be found."
7346,BOOK IX.,"Thou therefore, seasonably kind, devise"
7347,BOOK IX.,Means to preserve from such disast’rous fate
7348,BOOK IX.,"The Grecians. Ah, my friend! when Peleus thee310"
7349,BOOK IX.,"From Phthia sent to Agamemnon’s aid,"
7350,BOOK IX.,On that same day he gave thee thus in charge.
7351,BOOK IX.,"“Juno, my son, and Pallas, if they please,"
7352,BOOK IX.,Can make thee valiant; but thy own big heart
7353,BOOK IX.,Thyself restrain. Sweet manners win respect.315
7354,BOOK IX.,"Cease from pernicious strife, and young and old"
7355,BOOK IX.,Throughout the host shall honor thee the more.”
7356,BOOK IX.,"Such was thy father’s charge, which thou, it seems,"
7357,BOOK IX.,Remember’st not. Yet even now thy wrath
7358,BOOK IX.,Renounce; be reconciled; for princely gifts320
7359,BOOK IX.,Atrides gives thee if thy wrath subside.
7360,BOOK IX.,"Hear, if thou wilt, and I will tell thee all,"
7361,BOOK IX.,How vast the gifts which Agamemnon made
7362,BOOK IX.,"By promise thine, this night within his tent."
7363,BOOK IX.,Seven tripods never sullied yet with fire;325
7364,BOOK IX.,Of gold ten talents; twenty cauldrons bright;
7365,BOOK IX.,"Twelve steeds strong-limb’d, victorious in the race;"
7366,BOOK IX.,No man possessing prizes such as those
7367,BOOK IX.,"Which they have won for him, shall feel the want"
7368,BOOK IX.,"Of acquisitions splendid, or of gold.330"
7369,BOOK IX.,"Seven virtuous female captives he will give,"
7370,BOOK IX.,"Expert in arts domestic, Lesbians all,"
7371,BOOK IX.,"Whom when thou conquer’dst Lesbos, he received"
7372,BOOK IX.,"His chosen portion, passing woman-kind"
7373,BOOK IX.,In perfect loveliness of face and form.335
7374,BOOK IX.,"These will he give, and will with these resign"
7375,BOOK IX.,"Her whom he took, Briseïs, with an oath"
7376,BOOK IX.,"Most solemn, that unconscious as she was"
7377,BOOK IX.,"Of his embraces, such he yields her back."
7378,BOOK IX.,All these he gives thee now! and if at length340
7379,BOOK IX.,The Gods vouchsafe to us to overturn
7380,BOOK IX.,"Priam’s great city, thou shalt heap thy ships"
7381,BOOK IX.,"With gold and brass, entering and choosing first,"
7382,BOOK IX.,When we shall share the spoil; and shalt beside
7383,BOOK IX.,"Choose twenty from among the maids of Troy,345"
7384,BOOK IX.,"Helen except, loveliest of all their sex."
7385,BOOK IX.,And if once more the rich milk-flowing land
7386,BOOK IX.,"We reach of Argos, thou shalt there become"
7387,BOOK IX.,"His son-in-law, and shalt enjoy like state"
7388,BOOK IX.,"With him, whom he in all abundance rears,350"
7389,BOOK IX.,His only son Orestes. In his house
7390,BOOK IX.,He hath three daughters; thou may’st home conduct
7391,BOOK IX.,"To Phthia, her whom thou shalt most approve."
7392,BOOK IX.,Chrysothemis shall be thy bride; or else
7393,BOOK IX.,Laodice; or if she please thee more355
7394,BOOK IX.,Iphianassa; and from thee he asks
7395,BOOK IX.,No dower; himself will such a dower bestow
7396,BOOK IX.,As never father on his child before.
7397,BOOK IX.,Seven fair well-peopled cities will he give;
7398,BOOK IX.,Cardamyle and Enope; and rich360
7399,BOOK IX.,"In herbage, Hira; Pheræ stately-built,"
7400,BOOK IX.,"And for her depth of pasturage renown’d,"
7401,BOOK IX.,"Antheia; proud Æpeia’s lofty towers,"
7402,BOOK IX.,And Pedasus impurpled dark with vines.
7403,BOOK IX.,"All these are maritime, and on the shore365"
7404,BOOK IX.,"They stand of Pylus, by a race possess’d"
7405,BOOK IX.,"Most rich in flocks and herds, who tribute large"
7406,BOOK IX.,"And gifts presenting to thy sceptred hand,"
7407,BOOK IX.,Shall hold thee high in honor as a God.
7408,BOOK IX.,"These will he give thee, if thy wrath subside.370"
7409,BOOK IX.,But should’st thou rather in thine heart the more
7410,BOOK IX.,"Both Agamemnon and his gifts detest,"
7411,BOOK IX.,Yet oh compassionate the afflicted host
7412,BOOK IX.,Prepared to adore thee. Thou shalt win renown
7413,BOOK IX.,Among the Grecians that shall never die.375
7414,BOOK IX.,Now strike at Hector. He is here;—himself
7415,BOOK IX.,"Provokes thee forth; madness is in his heart,"
7416,BOOK IX.,And in his rage he glories that our ships
7417,BOOK IX.,Have hither brought no Grecian brave as he.
7418,BOOK IX.,Then thus Achilles matchless in the race.380
7419,BOOK IX.,"Laertes’ noble son, for wiles renown’d!"
7420,BOOK IX.,I must with plainness speak my fixt resolve
7421,BOOK IX.,Unalterable; lest I hear from each
7422,BOOK IX.,The same long murmur’d melancholy tale.
7423,BOOK IX.,"For I abhor the man, not more the gates385"
7424,BOOK IX.,"Of hell itself, whose words belie his heart."
7425,BOOK IX.,So shall not mine. My judgment undisguised
7426,BOOK IX.,Is this; that neither Agamemnon me
7427,BOOK IX.,Nor all the Greeks shall move; for ceaseless toil
7428,BOOK IX.,Wins here no thanks; one recompense awaits390
7429,BOOK IX.,"The sedentary and the most alert,"
7430,BOOK IX.,"The brave and base in equal honor stand,"
7431,BOOK IX.,And drones and heroes fall unwept alike.
7432,BOOK IX.,"I after all my labors, who exposed"
7433,BOOK IX.,"My life continual in the field, have earn’d395"
7434,BOOK IX.,No very sumptuous prize. As the poor bird
7435,BOOK IX.,Gives to her unfledged brood a morsel gain’d
7436,BOOK IX.,"After long search, though wanting it herself,"
7437,BOOK IX.,"So I have worn out many sleepless nights,"
7438,BOOK IX.,And waded deep through many a bloody day400
7439,BOOK IX.,In battle for their wives.[12] I have destroy’d
7440,BOOK IX.,"Twelve cities with my fleet, and twelve, save one,"
7441,BOOK IX.,On foot contending in the fields of Troy.
7442,BOOK IX.,"From all these cities, precious spoils I took"
7443,BOOK IX.,"Abundant, and to Agamemnon’s hand405"
7444,BOOK IX.,Gave all the treasure. He within his ships
7445,BOOK IX.,"Abode the while, and having all received,"
7446,BOOK IX.,"Little distributed, and much retained;"
7447,BOOK IX.,"He gave, however, to the Kings and Chiefs"
7448,BOOK IX.,"A portion, and they keep it. Me alone410"
7449,BOOK IX.,Of all the Grecian host he hath despoil’d;
7450,BOOK IX.,"My bride, my soul’s delight is in his hands,"
7451,BOOK IX.,"And let him, couch’d with her, enjoy his fill"
7452,BOOK IX.,"Of dalliance. What sufficient cause, what need"
7453,BOOK IX.,Have the Achaians to contend with Troy?415
7454,BOOK IX.,"Why hath Atrides gather’d such a host,"
7455,BOOK IX.,And led them hither? Was’t not for the sake
7456,BOOK IX.,Of beauteous Helen? And of all mankind
7457,BOOK IX.,Can none be found who love their proper wives
7458,BOOK IX.,But the Atridæ? There is no good man420
7459,BOOK IX.,"Who loves not, guards not, and with care provides"
7460,BOOK IX.,"For his own wife, and, though in battle won,"
7461,BOOK IX.,I loved the fair Briseïs at my heart.
7462,BOOK IX.,But having dispossess’d me of my prize
7463,BOOK IX.,"So foully, let him not essay me now,425"
7464,BOOK IX.,"For I am warn’d, and he shall not prevail."
7465,BOOK IX.,"With thee and with thy peers let him advise,"
7466,BOOK IX.,Ulysses! how the fleet may likeliest ’scape
7467,BOOK IX.,Yon hostile fires; full many an arduous task
7468,BOOK IX.,He hath accomplished without aid of mine;430
7469,BOOK IX.,So hath he now this rampart and the trench
7470,BOOK IX.,"Which he hath digg’d around it, and with stakes"
7471,BOOK IX.,Planted contiguous—puny barriers all
7472,BOOK IX.,To hero-slaughtering Hector’s force opposed.
7473,BOOK IX.,"While I the battle waged, present myself435"
7474,BOOK IX.,"Among the Achaians, Hector never fought"
7475,BOOK IX.,"Far from his walls, but to the Scæan gate"
7476,BOOK IX.,"Advancing and the beech-tree, there remain’d."
7477,BOOK IX.,"Once, on that spot he met me, and my arm"
7478,BOOK IX.,Escaped with difficulty even there.440
7479,BOOK IX.,"But, since I feel myself not now inclined"
7480,BOOK IX.,"To fight with noble Hector, yielding first"
7481,BOOK IX.,"To Jove due worship, and to all the Gods,"
7482,BOOK IX.,"To-morrow will I launch, and give my ships"
7483,BOOK IX.,"Their lading. Look thou forth at early dawn,445"
7484,BOOK IX.,"And, if such spectacle delight thee aught,"
7485,BOOK IX.,Thou shalt behold me cleaving with my prows
7486,BOOK IX.,"The waves of Hellespont, and all my crews"
7487,BOOK IX.,Of lusty rowers active in their task.
7488,BOOK IX.,So shall I reach (if Ocean’s mighty God450
7489,BOOK IX.,Prosper my passage) Phthia the deep-soil’d
7490,BOOK IX.,"On the third day. I have possessions there,"
7491,BOOK IX.,Which hither roaming in an evil hour
7492,BOOK IX.,I left abundant. I shall also hence
7493,BOOK IX.,"Convey much treasure, gold and burnish’d brass,455"
7494,BOOK IX.,"And glittering steel, and women passing fair"
7495,BOOK IX.,"My portion of the spoils. But he, your King,"
7496,BOOK IX.,"The prize he gave, himself resumed,"
7497,BOOK IX.,"And taunted at me. Tell him my reply,"
7498,BOOK IX.,"And tell it him aloud, that other Greeks460"
7499,BOOK IX.,"May indignation feel like me, if arm’d"
7500,BOOK IX.,"Always in impudence, he seek to wrong"
7501,BOOK IX.,"Them also. Let him not henceforth presume,"
7502,BOOK IX.,"Canine and hard in aspect though he be,"
7503,BOOK IX.,To look me in the face. I will not share465
7504,BOOK IX.,"His counsels, neither will I aid his works."
7505,BOOK IX.,"Let it suffice him, that he wrong’d me once,"
7506,BOOK IX.,"Deceived me once, henceforth his glozing arts"
7507,BOOK IX.,Are lost on me. But let him rot in peace
7508,BOOK IX.,"Crazed as he is, and by the stroke of Jove470"
7509,BOOK IX.,"Infatuate. I detest his gifts, and him"
7510,BOOK IX.,So honor as the thing which most I scorn.
7511,BOOK IX.,And would he give me twenty times the worth
7512,BOOK IX.,"Of this his offer, all the treasured heaps"
7513,BOOK IX.,"Which he possesses, or shall yet possess,475"
7514,BOOK IX.,"All that Orchomenos within her walls,"
7515,BOOK IX.,And all that opulent Egyptian Thebes
7516,BOOK IX.,"Receives, the city with a hundred gates,"
7517,BOOK IX.,"Whence twenty thousand chariots rush to war,"
7518,BOOK IX.,"And would he give me riches as the sands,480"
7519,BOOK IX.,"And as the dust of earth, no gifts from him"
7520,BOOK IX.,"Should soothe me, till my soul were first avenged"
7521,BOOK IX.,For all the offensive license of his tongue.
7522,BOOK IX.,"I will not wed the daughter of your Chief,"
7523,BOOK IX.,Of Agamemnon. Could she vie in charms485
7524,BOOK IX.,"With golden Venus, had she all the skill"
7525,BOOK IX.,"Of blue-eyed Pallas, even so endow’d"
7526,BOOK IX.,She were no bride for me. No. He may choose
7527,BOOK IX.,"From the Achaians some superior Prince,"
7528,BOOK IX.,"One more her equal. Peleus, if the Gods490"
7529,BOOK IX.,"Preserve me, and I safe arrive at home,"
7530,BOOK IX.,"Himself, ere long, shall mate me with a bride."
7531,BOOK IX.,In Hellas and in Phthia may be found
7532,BOOK IX.,"Fair damsels many, daughters of the Chiefs"
7533,BOOK IX.,"Who guard our cities; I may choose of them,495"
7534,BOOK IX.,And make the loveliest of them all my own.
7535,BOOK IX.,"There, in my country, it hath ever been"
7536,BOOK IX.,"My dearest purpose, wedded to a wife"
7537,BOOK IX.,"Of rank convenient, to enjoy in peace"
7538,BOOK IX.,Such wealth as ancient Peleus hath acquired.500
7539,BOOK IX.,"For life, in my account, surpasses far"
7540,BOOK IX.,In value all the treasures which report
7541,BOOK IX.,"Ascribed to populous Ilium, ere the Greeks"
7542,BOOK IX.,"Arrived, and while the city yet had peace;"
7543,BOOK IX.,Those also which Apollo’s marble shrine505
7544,BOOK IX.,In rocky Pytho boasts. Fat flocks and beeves
7545,BOOK IX.,"May be by force obtain’d, tripods and steeds"
7546,BOOK IX.,"Are bought or won, but if the breath of man"
7547,BOOK IX.,"Once overpass its bounds, no force arrests"
7548,BOOK IX.,Or may constrain the unbodied spirit back.510
7549,BOOK IX.,"Me, as my silver-footed mother speaks"
7550,BOOK IX.,"Thetis, a twofold consummation waits."
7551,BOOK IX.,"If still with battle I encompass Troy,"
7552,BOOK IX.,"I win immortal glory, but all hope"
7553,BOOK IX.,Renounce of my return. If I return515
7554,BOOK IX.,"To my beloved country, I renounce"
7555,BOOK IX.,"The illustrious meed of glory, but obtain"
7556,BOOK IX.,Secure and long immunity from death.
7557,BOOK IX.,And truly I would recommend to all
7558,BOOK IX.,"To voyage homeward, for the fall as yet520"
7559,BOOK IX.,"Ye shall not see of Ilium’s lofty towers,"
7560,BOOK IX.,For that the Thunderer with uplifted arm
7561,BOOK IX.,"Protects her, and her courage hath revived."
7562,BOOK IX.,"Bear ye mine answer back, as is the part"
7563,BOOK IX.,"Of good ambassadors, that they may frame525"
7564,BOOK IX.,"Some likelier plan, by which both fleet and host"
7565,BOOK IX.,"May be preserved; for, my resentment still"
7566,BOOK IX.,"Burning, this project is but premature."
7567,BOOK IX.,"Let Phœnix stay with us, and sleep this night"
7568,BOOK IX.,"Within my tent, that, if he so incline,530"
7569,BOOK IX.,"He may to-morrow in my fleet embark,"
7570,BOOK IX.,And hence attend me; but I leave him free.
7571,BOOK IX.,He ended; they astonish’d at his tone
7572,BOOK IX.,"(For vehement he spake) sat silent all,"
7573,BOOK IX.,"Till Phœnix, aged warrior, at the last535"
7574,BOOK IX.,Gush’d into tears (for dread his heart o’erwhelm’d
7575,BOOK IX.,Lest the whole fleet should perish) and replied.
7576,BOOK IX.,"If thou indeed have purposed to return,"
7577,BOOK IX.,Noble Achilles! and such wrath retain’st
7578,BOOK IX.,That thou art altogether fixt to leave540
7579,BOOK IX.,"The fleet a prey to desolating fires,"
7580,BOOK IX.,"How then, my son! shall I at Troy abide"
7581,BOOK IX.,"Forlorn of thee? When Peleus, hoary Chief,"
7582,BOOK IX.,"Sent thee to Agamemnon, yet a child,[13]"
7583,BOOK IX.,"Unpractised in destructive fight, nor less545"
7584,BOOK IX.,"Of councils ignorant, the schools in which"
7585,BOOK IX.,"Great minds are form’d, he bade me to the war"
7586,BOOK IX.,"Attend thee forth, that I might teach thee all,"
7587,BOOK IX.,Both elocution and address in arms.
7588,BOOK IX.,Me therefore shalt thou not with my consent550
7589,BOOK IX.,"Leave here, my son! no, not would Jove himself"
7590,BOOK IX.,"Promise me, reaping smooth this silver beard,"
7591,BOOK IX.,To make me downy-cheek’d as in my youth;
7592,BOOK IX.,Such as when erst from Hellas beauty-famed
7593,BOOK IX.,"I fled, escaping from my father’s wrath555"
7594,BOOK IX.,"Amyntor, son of Ormenus, who loved"
7595,BOOK IX.,"A beauteous concubine, and for her sake"
7596,BOOK IX.,Despised his wife and persecuted me.
7597,BOOK IX.,"My mother suppliant at my knees, with prayer"
7598,BOOK IX.,Perpetual importuned me to embrace560
7599,BOOK IX.,"The damsel first, that she might loathe my sire."
7600,BOOK IX.,I did so; and my father soon possess’d
7601,BOOK IX.,"With hot suspicion of the fact, let loose"
7602,BOOK IX.,"A storm of imprecation, in his rage"
7603,BOOK IX.,Invoking all the Furies to forbid565
7604,BOOK IX.,That ever son of mine should press his knees.
7605,BOOK IX.,Tartarian Jove[14] and dread Persephone
7606,BOOK IX.,Fulfill’d his curses; with my pointed spear
7607,BOOK IX.,"I would have pierced his heart, but that my wrath"
7608,BOOK IX.,"Some Deity assuaged, suggesting oft570"
7609,BOOK IX.,"What shame and obloquy I should incur,"
7610,BOOK IX.,Known as a parricide through all the land.
7611,BOOK IX.,"At length, so treated, I resolved to dwell"
7612,BOOK IX.,"No longer in his house. My friends, indeed,"
7613,BOOK IX.,And all my kindred compass’d me around575
7614,BOOK IX.,"With much entreaty, wooing me to stay;"
7615,BOOK IX.,"Oxen and sheep they slaughter’d, many a plump"
7616,BOOK IX.,"Well-fatted brawn extended in the flames,"
7617,BOOK IX.,And drank the old man’s vessels to the lees.
7618,BOOK IX.,"Nine nights continual at my side they slept,580"
7619,BOOK IX.,"While others watch’d by turns, nor were the fires"
7620,BOOK IX.,"Extinguish’d ever, one, beneath the porch"
7621,BOOK IX.,"Of the barr’d hall, and one that from within"
7622,BOOK IX.,The vestibule illumed my chamber door.
7623,BOOK IX.,"But when the tenth dark night at length arrived,585"
7624,BOOK IX.,Sudden the chamber doors bursting I flew
7625,BOOK IX.,"That moment forth, and unperceived alike"
7626,BOOK IX.,"By guards and menial woman, leap’d the wall."
7627,BOOK IX.,"Through spacious Hellas flying thence afar,"
7628,BOOK IX.,"I came at length to Phthia the deep-soil’d,590"
7629,BOOK IX.,"Mother of flocks, and to the royal house"
7630,BOOK IX.,Of Peleus; Peleus with a willing heart
7631,BOOK IX.,"Receiving, loved me as a father loves"
7632,BOOK IX.,"His only son, the son of his old age,"
7633,BOOK IX.,Inheritor of all his large demesnes.595
7634,BOOK IX.,He made me rich; placed under my control
7635,BOOK IX.,"A populous realm, and on the skirts I dwelt"
7636,BOOK IX.,"Of Phthia, ruling the Dolopian race."
7637,BOOK IX.,"Thee from my soul, thou semblance of the Gods,"
7638,BOOK IX.,"I loved, and all illustrious as thou art,600"
7639,BOOK IX.,"Achilles! such I made thee. For with me,"
7640,BOOK IX.,"Me only, would’st thou forth to feast abroad,"
7641,BOOK IX.,"Nor would’st thou taste thy food at home, till first"
7642,BOOK IX.,"I placed thee on my knees, with my own hand"
7643,BOOK IX.,"Thy viands carved and fed thee, and the wine605"
7644,BOOK IX.,"Held to thy lips; and many a time, in fits"
7645,BOOK IX.,"Of infant frowardness, the purple juice"
7646,BOOK IX.,"Rejecting thou hast deluged all my vest,"
7647,BOOK IX.,"And fill’d my bosom. Oh, I have endured"
7648,BOOK IX.,"Much, and have also much perform’d for thee,610"
7649,BOOK IX.,"Thus purposing, that since the Gods vouchsaf’d"
7650,BOOK IX.,"No son to me, thyself shouldst be my son,"
7651,BOOK IX.,Godlike Achilles! who shouldst screen perchance
7652,BOOK IX.,From a foul fate my else unshelter’d age.
7653,BOOK IX.,Achilles! bid thy mighty spirit down.615
7654,BOOK IX.,"Thou shouldst not be thus merciless; the Gods,"
7655,BOOK IX.,"Although more honorable, and in power"
7656,BOOK IX.,"And virtue thy superiors, are themselves"
7657,BOOK IX.,Yet placable; and if a mortal man
7658,BOOK IX.,"Offend them by transgression of their laws,620"
7659,BOOK IX.,"Libation, incense, sacrifice, and prayer,"
7660,BOOK IX.,In meekness offer’d turn their wrath away.
7661,BOOK IX.,"Prayers are Jove’s daughters,[15] wrinkled,[16] lame, slant-eyed,"
7662,BOOK IX.,"Which though far distant, yet with constant pace"
7663,BOOK IX.,"Follow Offence. Offence, robust of limb,625"
7664,BOOK IX.,"And treading firm the ground, outstrips them all,"
7665,BOOK IX.,And over all the earth before them runs
7666,BOOK IX.,"Hurtful to man. They, following, heal the hurt."
7667,BOOK IX.,"Received respectfully when they approach,"
7668,BOOK IX.,"They help us, and our prayers hear in return.630"
7669,BOOK IX.,"But if we slight, and with obdurate heart"
7670,BOOK IX.,"Resist them, to Saturnian Jove they cry"
7671,BOOK IX.,"Against us, supplicating that Offence"
7672,BOOK IX.,May cleave to us for vengeance of the wrong.
7673,BOOK IX.,"Thou, therefore, O Achilles! honor yield635"
7674,BOOK IX.,"To Jove’s own daughters, vanquished, as the brave"
7675,BOOK IX.,"Have ofttimes been, by honor paid to thee."
7676,BOOK IX.,For came not Agamemnon as he comes
7677,BOOK IX.,"With gifts in hand, and promises of more"
7678,BOOK IX.,"Hereafter; burn’d his anger still the same,640"
7679,BOOK IX.,"I would not move thee to renounce thy own,"
7680,BOOK IX.,"And to assist us, howsoe’er distress’d."
7681,BOOK IX.,"But now, not only are his present gifts"
7682,BOOK IX.,"Most liberal, and his promises of more"
7683,BOOK IX.,"Such also, but these Princes he hath sent645"
7684,BOOK IX.,"Charged with entreaties, thine especial friends,"
7685,BOOK IX.,"And chosen for that cause, from all the host."
7686,BOOK IX.,"Slight not their embassy, nor put to shame"
7687,BOOK IX.,Their intercession. We confess that once
7688,BOOK IX.,Thy wrath was unreprovable and just.650
7689,BOOK IX.,Thus we have heard the heroes of old times
7690,BOOK IX.,"Applauded oft, whose anger, though intense,"
7691,BOOK IX.,Yet left them open to the gentle sway
7692,BOOK IX.,Of reason and conciliatory gifts.
7693,BOOK IX.,"I recollect an ancient history,655"
7694,BOOK IX.,"Which, since all here are friends, I will relate."
7695,BOOK IX.,The brave Ætolians and Curetes met
7696,BOOK IX.,"Beneath the walls of Calydon, and fought"
7697,BOOK IX.,With mutual slaughter; the Ætolian powers
7698,BOOK IX.,"In the defence of Calydon the fair,660"
7699,BOOK IX.,And the Curetes bent to lay it waste:
7700,BOOK IX.,That strife Diana of the golden throne
7701,BOOK IX.,"Kindled between them, with resentment fired"
7702,BOOK IX.,That Oeneus had not in some fertile spot
7703,BOOK IX.,The first fruits of his harvest set apart665
7704,BOOK IX.,To her; with hecatombs he entertained
7705,BOOK IX.,"All the Divinities of heaven beside,"
7706,BOOK IX.,"And her alone, daughter of Jove supreme,"
7707,BOOK IX.,"Or through forgetfulness, or some neglect,"
7708,BOOK IX.,Served not; omission careless and profane!670
7709,BOOK IX.,"She, progeny of Jove, Goddess shaft-arm’d,"
7710,BOOK IX.,"A savage boar bright-tusk’d in anger sent,"
7711,BOOK IX.,Which haunting Oeneus’ fields much havoc made.
7712,BOOK IX.,Trees numerous on the earth in heaps he cast
7713,BOOK IX.,"Uprooting them, with all their blossoms on.675"
7714,BOOK IX.,"But Meleager, Oeneus’ son, at length"
7715,BOOK IX.,"Slew him, the hunters gathering and the hounds"
7716,BOOK IX.,Of numerous cities; for a boar so vast
7717,BOOK IX.,"Might not be vanquish’d by the power of few,"
7718,BOOK IX.,And many to their funeral piles he sent.680
7719,BOOK IX.,"Then raised Diana clamorous dispute,"
7720,BOOK IX.,"And contest hot between them, all alike,"
7721,BOOK IX.,Curetes and Ætolians fierce in arms
7722,BOOK IX.,"The boar’s head claiming, and his bristly hide."
7723,BOOK IX.,"So long as warlike Meleager fought,685"
7724,BOOK IX.,"Ætolia prosper’d, nor with all their powers"
7725,BOOK IX.,Could the Curetes stand before the walls.
7726,BOOK IX.,But when resentment once had fired the heart
7727,BOOK IX.,"Of Meleager, which hath tumult oft"
7728,BOOK IX.,"Excited in the breasts of wisest men,690"
7729,BOOK IX.,(For his own mother had his wrath provoked
7730,BOOK IX.,Althæa) thenceforth with his wedded wife
7731,BOOK IX.,"He dwelt, fair Cleopatra, close retired."
7732,BOOK IX.,"She was Marpessa’s daughter, whom she bore"
7733,BOOK IX.,"To Idas, bravest warrior in his day695"
7734,BOOK IX.,Of all on earth. He fear’d not ’gainst the King
7735,BOOK IX.,"Himself Apollo, for the lovely nymph"
7736,BOOK IX.,"Marpessa’s sake, his spouse, to bend his bow."
7737,BOOK IX.,"Her, therefore, Idas and Marpessa named"
7738,BOOK IX.,"Thenceforth Alcyone, because the fate700"
7739,BOOK IX.,"Of sad Alcyone Marpessa shared,"
7740,BOOK IX.,"And wept like her, by Phœbus forced away."
7741,BOOK IX.,"Thus Meleager, tortured with the pangs"
7742,BOOK IX.,"Of wrath indulged, with Cleopatra dwelt,"
7743,BOOK IX.,"Vex’d that his mother cursed him; for, with grief705"
7744,BOOK IX.,"Frantic, his mother importuned the Gods"
7745,BOOK IX.,To avenge her slaughter’d brothers[17] on his head.
7746,BOOK IX.,"Oft would she smite the earth, while on her knees"
7747,BOOK IX.,"Seated, she fill’d her bosom with her tears,"
7748,BOOK IX.,And call’d on Pluto and dread Proserpine710
7749,BOOK IX.,"To slay her son; nor vain was that request,"
7750,BOOK IX.,But by implacable Erynnis heard
7751,BOOK IX.,Roaming the shades of Erebus. Ere long
7752,BOOK IX.,The tumult and the deafening din of war
7753,BOOK IX.,"Roar’d at the gates, and all the batter’d towers715"
7754,BOOK IX.,Resounded. Then the elders of the town
7755,BOOK IX.,Dispatch’d the high-priests of the Gods to plead
7756,BOOK IX.,"With Meleager for his instant aid,"
7757,BOOK IX.,With strong assurances of rich reward.
7758,BOOK IX.,Where Calydon afforded fattest soil720
7759,BOOK IX.,They bade him choose to his own use a farm
7760,BOOK IX.,"Of fifty measured acres, vineyard half,"
7761,BOOK IX.,And half of land commodious for the plow.
7762,BOOK IX.,"Him Oeneus also, warrior grey with age,"
7763,BOOK IX.,"Ascending to his chamber, and his doors725"
7764,BOOK IX.,"Smiting importunate, with earnest prayers"
7765,BOOK IX.,"Assay’d to soften, kneeling to his son."
7766,BOOK IX.,"Nor less his sisters woo’d him to relent,"
7767,BOOK IX.,Nor less his mother; but in vain; he grew
7768,BOOK IX.,"Still more obdurate. His companions last,730"
7769,BOOK IX.,"The most esteem’d and dearest of his friends,"
7770,BOOK IX.,"The same suit urged, yet he persisted still"
7771,BOOK IX.,"Relentless, nor could even they prevail."
7772,BOOK IX.,But when the battle shook his chamber-doors
7773,BOOK IX.,And the Curetes climbing the high towers735
7774,BOOK IX.,"Had fired the spacious city, then with tears"
7775,BOOK IX.,"The beauteous Cleopatra, and with prayers"
7776,BOOK IX.,Assail’d him; in his view she set the woes
7777,BOOK IX.,Numberless of a city storm’d—the men
7778,BOOK IX.,"Slaughter’d, the city burnt to dust, the chaste740"
7779,BOOK IX.,Matrons with all their children dragg’d away.
7780,BOOK IX.,"That dread recital roused him, and at length"
7781,BOOK IX.,"Issuing, he put his radiant armor on."
7782,BOOK IX.,"Thus Meleager, gratifying first"
7783,BOOK IX.,His own resentment from a fatal day745
7784,BOOK IX.,"Saved the Ætolians, who the promised gift"
7785,BOOK IX.,"Refused him, and his toils found no reward."
7786,BOOK IX.,"But thou, my son, be wiser; follow thou"
7787,BOOK IX.,No demon who would tempt thee to a course
7788,BOOK IX.,Like his; occasion more propitious far750
7789,BOOK IX.,"Smiles on thee now, than if the fleet were fired."
7790,BOOK IX.,"Come, while by gifts invited, and receive"
7791,BOOK IX.,"From all the host, the honors of a God;"
7792,BOOK IX.,"For shouldst thou, by no gifts induced, at last"
7793,BOOK IX.,"Enter the bloody field, although thou chase755"
7794,BOOK IX.,"The Trojans hence, yet less shall be thy praise."
7795,BOOK IX.,"Then thus Achilles, matchless in the race."
7796,BOOK IX.,"Phœnix, my guide, wise, noble and revered!"
7797,BOOK IX.,I covet no such glory! the renown
7798,BOOK IX.,"Ordain’d by Jove for me, is to resist760"
7799,BOOK IX.,All importunity to quit my ships
7800,BOOK IX.,"While I have power to move, or breath to draw."
7801,BOOK IX.,"Hear now, and mark me well. Cease thou from tears."
7802,BOOK IX.,"Confound me not, pleading with sighs and sobs"
7803,BOOK IX.,"In Agamemnon’s cause; O love not him,765"
7804,BOOK IX.,"Lest I renounce thee, who am now thy friend."
7805,BOOK IX.,"Assist me rather, as thy duty bids,"
7806,BOOK IX.,"Him to afflict, who hath afflicted me,"
7807,BOOK IX.,So shalt thou share my glory and my power.
7808,BOOK IX.,"These shall report as they have heard, but here770"
7809,BOOK IX.,"Rest thou this night, and with the rising morn"
7810,BOOK IX.,"We will decide, to stay or to depart."
7811,BOOK IX.,"He ceased, and silent, by a nod enjoin’d"
7812,BOOK IX.,Patroclus to prepare an easy couch
7813,BOOK IX.,"For Phœnix, anxious to dismiss the rest775"
7814,BOOK IX.,"Incontinent; when Ajax, godlike son"
7815,BOOK IX.,"Of Telamon, arising, thus began."
7816,BOOK IX.,"Laertes’ noble son, for wiles renown’d:"
7817,BOOK IX.,Depart we now; for I perceive that end
7818,BOOK IX.,Or fruit of all our reasonings shall be none.780
7819,BOOK IX.,It is expedient also that we bear
7820,BOOK IX.,Our answer back (unwelcome as it is)
7821,BOOK IX.,"With all dispatch, for the assembled Greeks"
7822,BOOK IX.,Expect us. Brave Achilles shuts a fire
7823,BOOK IX.,"Within his breast; the kindness of his friends,785"
7824,BOOK IX.,And the respect peculiar by ourselves
7825,BOOK IX.,"Shown to him, on his heart work no effect."
7826,BOOK IX.,Inexorable man! others accept
7827,BOOK IX.,"Even for a brother slain, or for a son"
7828,BOOK IX.,Due compensation;[18] the delinquent dwells790
7829,BOOK IX.,"Secure at home, and the receiver, soothed"
7830,BOOK IX.,"And pacified, represses his revenge."
7831,BOOK IX.,"But thou, resentful of the loss of one,"
7832,BOOK IX.,One virgin (such obduracy of heart
7833,BOOK IX.,The Gods have given thee) can’st not be appeased795
7834,BOOK IX.,"Yet we assign thee seven in her stead,"
7835,BOOK IX.,"The most distinguish’d of their sex, and add"
7836,BOOK IX.,"Large gifts beside. Ah then, at last relent!"
7837,BOOK IX.,Respect thy roof; we are thy guests; we come
7838,BOOK IX.,"Chosen from the multitude of all the Greeks,800"
7839,BOOK IX.,Beyond them all ambitious of thy love.
7840,BOOK IX.,"To whom Achilles, swiftest of the swift."
7841,BOOK IX.,"My noble friend, offspring of Telamon!"
7842,BOOK IX.,"Thou seem’st sincere, and I believe thee such."
7843,BOOK IX.,But at the very mention of the name805
7844,BOOK IX.,"Of Atreus’ son, who shamed me in the sight"
7845,BOOK IX.,"Of all Achaia’s host, bearing me down"
7846,BOOK IX.,"As I had been some vagrant at his door,"
7847,BOOK IX.,My bosom boils. Return ye and report
7848,BOOK IX.,Your answer. I no thought will entertain810
7849,BOOK IX.,"Of crimson war, till the illustrious son"
7850,BOOK IX.,"Of warlike Priam, Hector, blood-embrued,"
7851,BOOK IX.,Shall in their tents the Myrmidons assail
7852,BOOK IX.,"Themselves, and fire my fleet. At my own ship,"
7853,BOOK IX.,And at my own pavilion it may chance815
7854,BOOK IX.,That even Hector’s violence shall pause.[19]
7855,BOOK IX.,He ended; they from massy goblets each
7856,BOOK IX.,"Libation pour’d, and to the fleet their course"
7857,BOOK IX.,"Resumed direct, Ulysses at their head."
7858,BOOK IX.,"Patroclus then his fellow-warriors bade,820"
7859,BOOK IX.,And the attendant women spread a couch
7860,BOOK IX.,"For Phœnix; they the couch, obedient, spread"
7861,BOOK IX.,"With fleeces, with rich arras, and with flax"
7862,BOOK IX.,Of subtlest woof. There hoary Phœnix lay
7863,BOOK IX.,In expectation of the sacred dawn.825
7864,BOOK IX.,"Meantime Achilles in the interior tent,"
7865,BOOK IX.,With beauteous Diomeda by himself
7866,BOOK IX.,"From Lesbos brought, daughter of Phorbas, lay."
7867,BOOK IX.,"Patroclus opposite reposed, with whom"
7868,BOOK IX.,"Slept charming Iphis; her, when he had won830"
7869,BOOK IX.,"The lofty towers of Scyros, the divine"
7870,BOOK IX.,"Achilles took, and on his friend bestow’d."
7871,BOOK IX.,But when those Chiefs at Agamemnon’s tent
7872,BOOK IX.,"Arrived, the Greeks on every side arose"
7873,BOOK IX.,With golden cups welcoming their return.835
7874,BOOK IX.,"All question’d them, but Agamemnon first."
7875,BOOK IX.,"Oh worthy of Achaia’s highest praise,"
7876,BOOK IX.,"And her chief ornament, Ulysses, speak!"
7877,BOOK IX.,Will he defend the fleet? or his big heart
7878,BOOK IX.,"Indulging wrathful, doth he still refuse?840"
7879,BOOK IX.,To whom renown’d Ulysses thus replied.
7880,BOOK IX.,"Atrides, Agamemnon, King of men!"
7881,BOOK IX.,"He his resentment quenches not, nor will,"
7882,BOOK IX.,"But burns with wrath the more, thee and thy gifts"
7883,BOOK IX.,Rejecting both. He bids thee with the Greeks845
7884,BOOK IX.,Consult by what expedient thou may’st save
7885,BOOK IX.,"The fleet and people, threatening that himself"
7886,BOOK IX.,"Will at the peep of day launch all his barks,"
7887,BOOK IX.,"And counselling, beside, the general host"
7888,BOOK IX.,"To voyage homeward, for that end as yet850"
7889,BOOK IX.,"Of Ilium wall’d to heaven, ye shall not find,"
7890,BOOK IX.,Since Jove the Thunderer with uplifted arm
7891,BOOK IX.,"Protects her, and her courage hath revived."
7892,BOOK IX.,"Thus speaks the Chief, and Ajax is prepared,"
7893,BOOK IX.,With the attendant heralds to report855
7894,BOOK IX.,As I have said. But Phœnix in the tent
7895,BOOK IX.,"Sleeps of Achilles, who his stay desired,"
7896,BOOK IX.,"That on the morrow, if he so incline,"
7897,BOOK IX.,The hoary warrior may attend him hence
7898,BOOK IX.,"Home to his country, but he leaves him free.860"
7899,BOOK IX.,He ended. They astonish’d at his tone
7900,BOOK IX.,(For vehement he spake) sat silent all.
7901,BOOK IX.,"Long silent sat the afflicted sons of Greece,"
7902,BOOK IX.,When thus the mighty Diomede began.
7903,BOOK IX.,"Atrides, Agamemnon, King of men!865"
7904,BOOK IX.,Thy supplications to the valiant son
7905,BOOK IX.,"Of Peleus, and the offer of thy gifts"
7906,BOOK IX.,"Innumerous, had been better far withheld."
7907,BOOK IX.,"He is at all times haughty, and thy suit"
7908,BOOK IX.,Hath but increased his haughtiness of heart870
7909,BOOK IX.,Past bounds: but let him stay or let him go
7910,BOOK IX.,As he shall choose. He will resume the fight
7911,BOOK IX.,"When his own mind shall prompt him, and the Gods"
7912,BOOK IX.,Shall urge him forth. Now follow my advice.
7913,BOOK IX.,Ye have refresh’d your hearts with food and wine875
7914,BOOK IX.,Which are the strength of man; take now repose.
7915,BOOK IX.,And when the rosy-finger’d morning fair
7916,BOOK IX.,"Shall shine again, set forth without delay"
7917,BOOK IX.,"The battle, horse and foot, before the fleet,"
7918,BOOK IX.,"And where the foremost fight, fight also thou.880"
7919,BOOK IX.,
7920,BOOK IX.,He ended; all the Kings applauded warm
7921,BOOK IX.,"His counsel, and the dauntless tone admired"
7922,BOOK IX.,"Of Diomede. Then, due libation made,"
7923,BOOK IX.,"Each sought his tent, and took the gift of sleep."
7924,BOOK IX.,
7925,BOOK IX.,
7926,BOOK IX.,There is much in this book which is worthy of close attention. The
7927,BOOK IX.,"consummate genius, the varied and versatile power, the eloquence,"
7928,BOOK IX.,"truth, and nature displayed in it, will always be admired. Perhaps"
7929,BOOK IX.,there is no portion of the poem more remarkable for these
7930,BOOK IX.,attributes.—Felton.

7948,BOOK X.,The son of Atreus; him from thought to thought
7949,BOOK X.,"Roving solicitous, no sleep relieved."
7950,BOOK X.,"As when the spouse of beauteous Juno, darts5"
7951,BOOK X.,"His frequent fires, designing heavy rain"
7952,BOOK X.,"Immense, or hail-storm, or field-whitening snow,"
7953,BOOK X.,"Or else wide-throated war calamitous,"
7954,BOOK X.,So frequent were the groans by Atreus’ son
7955,BOOK X.,"Heaved from his inmost heart, trembling with dread.10"
7956,BOOK X.,For cast he but his eye toward the plain
7957,BOOK X.,"Of Ilium, there, astonish’d he beheld"
7958,BOOK X.,"The city fronted with bright fires, and heard"
7959,BOOK X.,"Pipes, and recorders, and the hum of war;"
7960,BOOK X.,"But when again the Grecian fleet he view’d,15"
7961,BOOK X.,"And thought on his own people, then his hair"
7962,BOOK X.,"Uprooted elevating to the Gods,"
7963,BOOK X.,He from his generous bosom groan’d again.
7964,BOOK X.,At length he thus resolved; of all the Greeks
7965,BOOK X.,"To seek Neleian Nestor first, with whom20"
7966,BOOK X.,"He might, perchance, some plan for the defence"
7967,BOOK X.,Of the afflicted Danaï devise.
7968,BOOK X.,"Rising, he wrapp’d his tunic to his breast,"
7969,BOOK X.,And to his royal feet unsullied bound
7970,BOOK X.,"His sandals; o’er his shoulders, next, he threw25"
7971,BOOK X.,Of amplest size a lion’s tawny skin
7972,BOOK X.,"That swept his footsteps, dappled o’er with blood,"
7973,BOOK X.,"Then took his spear. Meantime, not less appall’d"
7974,BOOK X.,"Was Menelaus, on whose eyelids sleep"
7975,BOOK X.,"Sat not, lest the Achaians for his sake30"
7976,BOOK X.,"O’er many waters borne, and now intent"
7977,BOOK X.,"On glorious deeds, should perish all at Troy."
7978,BOOK X.,With a pard’s spotted hide his shoulders broad
7979,BOOK X.,He mantled over; to his head he raised
7980,BOOK X.,"His brazen helmet, and with vigorous hand35"
7981,BOOK X.,"Grasping his spear, forth issued to arouse"
7982,BOOK X.,"His brother, mighty sovereign of the host,"
7983,BOOK X.,And by the Grecians like a God revered.
7984,BOOK X.,"He found him at his galley’s stern, his arms"
7985,BOOK X.,Assuming radiant; welcome he arrived40
7986,BOOK X.,"To Agamemnon, whom he thus address’d."
7987,BOOK X.,"Why arm’st thou, brother? Wouldst thou urge abroad"
7988,BOOK X.,Some trusty spy into the Trojan camp?[2]
7989,BOOK X.,I fear lest none so hardy shall be found
7990,BOOK X.,"As to adventure, in the dead still night,45"
7991,BOOK X.,"So far, alone; valiant indeed were he!"
7992,BOOK X.,To whom great Agamemnon thus replied.
7993,BOOK X.,"Heaven-favor’d Menelaus! We have need,"
7994,BOOK X.,"Thou and myself, of some device well-framed,"
7995,BOOK X.,Which both the Grecians and the fleet of Greece50
7996,BOOK X.,"May rescue, for the mind of Jove hath changed,"
7997,BOOK X.,And Hector’s prayers alone now reach his ear.
7998,BOOK X.,"I never saw, nor by report have learn’d"
7999,BOOK X.,"From any man, that ever single chief"
8000,BOOK X.,Such awful wonders in one day perform’d55
8001,BOOK X.,"As he with ease against the Greeks, although"
8002,BOOK X.,Nor from a Goddess sprung nor from a God.
8003,BOOK X.,"Deeds he hath done, which, as I think, the Greeks"
8004,BOOK X.,"Shall deep and long lament, such numerous ills"
8005,BOOK X.,Achaia’s host hath at his hands sustain’d.60
8006,BOOK X.,"But haste, begone, and at their several ships"
8007,BOOK X.,Call Ajax and Idomeneus; I go
8008,BOOK X.,"To exhort the noble Nestor to arise,"
8009,BOOK X.,"That he may visit, if he so incline,"
8010,BOOK X.,"The chosen band who watch, and his advice65"
8011,BOOK X.,"Give them; for him most prompt they will obey,"
8012,BOOK X.,"Whose son, together with Meriones,"
8013,BOOK X.,"Friend of Idomeneus, controls them all,"
8014,BOOK X.,Entrusted by ourselves with that command.
8015,BOOK X.,Him answer’d Menelaus bold in arms.70
8016,BOOK X.,Explain thy purpose. Wouldst thou that I wait
8017,BOOK X.,"Thy coming, there, or thy commands to both"
8018,BOOK X.,"Given, that I incontinent return?"
8019,BOOK X.,To whom the Sovereign of the host replied.
8020,BOOK X.,There stay; lest striking into different paths75
8021,BOOK X.,(For many passes intersect the camp)
8022,BOOK X.,We miss each other; summon them aloud
8023,BOOK X.,Where thou shalt come; enjoin them to arise;
8024,BOOK X.,"Call each by his hereditary name,"
8025,BOOK X.,"Honoring all. Beware of manners proud,80"
8026,BOOK X.,"For we ourselves must labor, at our birth"
8027,BOOK X.,By Jove ordain’d to suffering and to toil.
8028,BOOK X.,"So saying, he his brother thence dismiss’d"
8029,BOOK X.,"Instructed duly, and himself, his steps"
8030,BOOK X.,Turned to the tent of Nestor. Him he found85
8031,BOOK X.,Amid his sable galleys in his tent
8032,BOOK X.,"Reposing soft, his armor at his side,"
8033,BOOK X.,"Shield, spears, bright helmet, and the broider’d belt"
8034,BOOK X.,"Which, when the Senior arm’d led forth his host"
8035,BOOK X.,"To fight, he wore; for he complied not yet90"
8036,BOOK X.,With the encroachments of enfeebling age.
8037,BOOK X.,"He raised his head, and on his elbow propp’d,"
8038,BOOK X.,"Questioning Agamemnon, thus began."
8039,BOOK X.,"But who art thou, who thus alone, the camp"
8040,BOOK X.,"Roamest, amid the darkness of the night,95"
8041,BOOK X.,While other mortals sleep? Comest thou abroad
8042,BOOK X.,Seeking some friend or soldier of the guard?
8043,BOOK X.,Speak—come not nearer mute. What is thy wish?
8044,BOOK X.,"To whom the son of Atreus, King of men."
8045,BOOK X.,"Oh Nestor, glory of the Grecian name,100"
8046,BOOK X.,Offspring of Neleus! thou in me shalt know
8047,BOOK X.,"The son of Atreus, Agamemnon, doom’d"
8048,BOOK X.,"By Jove to toil, while life shall yet inform"
8049,BOOK X.,"These limbs, or I shall draw the vital air."
8050,BOOK X.,"I wander thus, because that on my lids105"
8051,BOOK X.,"Sweet sleep sits not, but war and the concerns"
8052,BOOK X.,Of the Achaians occupy my soul.
8053,BOOK X.,Terrible are the fears which I endure
8054,BOOK X.,For these my people; such as supersede
8055,BOOK X.,All thought; my bosom can no longer hold110
8056,BOOK X.,"My throbbing heart, and tremors shake my limbs."
8057,BOOK X.,"But if thy mind, more capable, project"
8058,BOOK X.,Aught that may profit us (for thee it seems
8059,BOOK X.,"Sleep also shuns) arise, and let us both"
8060,BOOK X.,"Visit the watch, lest, haply, overtoil’d115"
8061,BOOK X.,"They yield to sleep, forgetful of their charge."
8062,BOOK X.,"The foe is posted near, and may intend"
8063,BOOK X.,(None knows his purpose) an assault by night.
8064,BOOK X.,To him Gerenian Nestor thus replied.
8065,BOOK X.,"Illustrious Agamemnon, King of men!120"
8066,BOOK X.,Deep-planning Jove the imaginations proud
8067,BOOK X.,"Of Hector will not ratify, nor all"
8068,BOOK X.,His sanguine hopes effectuate; in his turn
8069,BOOK X.,He also (fierce Achilles once appeased)
8070,BOOK X.,"Shall trouble feel, and haply, more than we.125"
8071,BOOK X.,But with all readiness I will arise
8072,BOOK X.,"And follow thee, that we may also rouse"
8073,BOOK X.,"Yet others; Diomede the spear-renown’d,"
8074,BOOK X.,"Ulysses, the swift Ajax, and the son"
8075,BOOK X.,"Of Phyleus, valiant Meges. It were well130"
8076,BOOK X.,"Were others also visited and call’d,"
8077,BOOK X.,"The godlike Ajax, and Idomeneus,"
8078,BOOK X.,Whose ships are at the camp’s extremest bounds.
8079,BOOK X.,"But though I love thy brother and revere,"
8080,BOOK X.,"And though I grieve e’en thee, yet speak I must,135"
8081,BOOK X.,"And plainly censure him, that thus he sleeps"
8082,BOOK X.,"And leaves to thee the labor, who himself"
8083,BOOK X.,"Should range the host, soliciting the Chiefs"
8084,BOOK X.,"Of every band, as utmost need requires."
8085,BOOK X.,"Him answer’d Agamemnon, King of men.140"
8086,BOOK X.,"Old warrior, times there are, when I could wish"
8087,BOOK X.,"Myself thy censure of him, for in act"
8088,BOOK X.,He is not seldom tardy and remiss.
8089,BOOK X.,"Yet is not sluggish indolence the cause,"
8090,BOOK X.,"No, nor stupidity, but he observes145"
8091,BOOK X.,"Me much, expecting till I lead the way."
8092,BOOK X.,"But he was foremost now, far more alert"
8093,BOOK X.,"This night than I, and I have sent him forth"
8094,BOOK X.,"Already, those to call whom thou hast named."
8095,BOOK X.,"But let us hence, for at the guard I trust150"
8096,BOOK X.,"To find them, since I gave them so in charge.[3]"
8097,BOOK X.,To whom the brave Gerenian Chief replied.
8098,BOOK X.,"Him none will censure, or his will dispute,"
8099,BOOK X.,Whom he shall waken and exhort to rise.
8100,BOOK X.,"So saying, he bound his corselet to his breast,155"
8101,BOOK X.,"His sandals fair to his unsullied feet,"
8102,BOOK X.,And fastening by its clasps his purple cloak
8103,BOOK X.,"Around him, double and of shaggy pile,"
8104,BOOK X.,"Seized, next, his sturdy spear headed with brass,"
8105,BOOK X.,And issued first into the Grecian fleet.160
8106,BOOK X.,"There, Nestor, brave Gerenian, with a voice"
8107,BOOK X.,Sonorous roused the godlike counsellor
8108,BOOK X.,"From sleep, Ulysses; the alarm came o’er"
8109,BOOK X.,"His startled ear, forth from his tent he sprang"
8110,BOOK X.,"Sudden, and of their coming, quick, inquired.165"
8111,BOOK X.,Why roam ye thus the camp and fleet alone
8112,BOOK X.,In darkness? by what urgent need constrain’d?
8113,BOOK X.,To whom the hoary Pylian thus replied.
8114,BOOK X.,"Laertes’ noble son, for wiles renown’d!"
8115,BOOK X.,"Resent it not, for dread is our distress.170"
8116,BOOK X.,"Come, therefore, and assist us to convene"
8117,BOOK X.,"Yet others, qualified to judge if war"
8118,BOOK X.,"Be most expedient, or immediate flight."
8119,BOOK X.,"He ended, and regaining, quick, his tent,"
8120,BOOK X.,"Ulysses slung his shield, then coming forth175"
8121,BOOK X.,Join’d them. The son of Tydeus first they sought.
8122,BOOK X.,"Him sleeping arm’d before his tent they found,"
8123,BOOK X.,Encompass’d by his friends also asleep;
8124,BOOK X.,"His head each rested on his shield, and each"
8125,BOOK X.,Had planted on its nether point[4] erect180
8126,BOOK X.,"His spear beside him; bright their polish’d heads,"
8127,BOOK X.,As Jove’s own lightning glittered from afar.
8128,BOOK X.,"Himself, the Hero, slept. A wild bull’s hide"
8129,BOOK X.,"Was spread beneath him, and on arras tinged"
8130,BOOK X.,With splendid purple lay his head reclined.185
8131,BOOK X.,"Nestor, beside him standing, with his heel"
8132,BOOK X.,"Shook him, and, urgent, thus the Chief reproved."
8133,BOOK X.,"Awake, Tydides! wherefore givest the night"
8134,BOOK X.,Entire to balmy slumber? Hast not heard
8135,BOOK X.,How on the rising ground beside the fleet190
8136,BOOK X.,"The Trojans sit, small interval between?"
8137,BOOK X.,He ceased; then up sprang Diomede alarm’d
8138,BOOK X.,"Instant, and in wing’d accents thus replied."
8139,BOOK X.,Old wakeful Chief! thy toils are never done.
8140,BOOK X.,"Are there not younger of the sons of Greece,195"
8141,BOOK X.,"Who ranging in all parts the camp, might call"
8142,BOOK X.,The Kings to council? But no curb controls
8143,BOOK X.,Or can abate activity like thine.
8144,BOOK X.,To whom Gerenian Nestor in return.
8145,BOOK X.,"My friend! thou hast well spoken. I have sons,200"
8146,BOOK X.,And they are well deserving; I have here
8147,BOOK X.,"A numerous people also, one of whom"
8148,BOOK X.,Might have sufficed to call the Kings of Greece.
8149,BOOK X.,But such occasion presses now the host
8150,BOOK X.,As hath not oft occurr’d; the overthrow205
8151,BOOK X.,"Complete, or full deliverance of us all,"
8152,BOOK X.,"In balance hangs, poised on a razor’s edge."
8153,BOOK X.,"But haste, and if thy pity of my toils"
8154,BOOK X.,"Be such, since thou art younger, call, thyself,"
8155,BOOK X.,"Ajax the swift, and Meges to the guard.210"
8156,BOOK X.,Then Diomede a lion’s tawny skin
8157,BOOK X.,"Around him wrapp’d, dependent to his heels,"
8158,BOOK X.,"And, spear in hand, set forth. The Hero call’d"
8159,BOOK X.,"Those two, and led them whither Nestor bade."
8160,BOOK X.,"They, at the guard arrived, not sleeping found215"
8161,BOOK X.,"The captains of the guard, but sitting all"
8162,BOOK X.,In vigilant posture with their arms prepared.
8163,BOOK X.,"As dogs that, careful, watch the fold by night,"
8164,BOOK X.,"Hearing some wild beast in the woods,[5] which hounds"
8165,BOOK X.,And hunters with tumultuous clamor drive220
8166,BOOK X.,"Down from the mountain-top, all sleep forego;"
8167,BOOK X.,"So, sat not on their eyelids gentle sleep"
8168,BOOK X.,"That dreadful night, but constant to the plain"
8169,BOOK X.,At every sound of Trojan feet they turn’d.
8170,BOOK X.,"The old Chief joyful at the sight, in terms225"
8171,BOOK X.,Of kind encouragement them thus address’d.
8172,BOOK X.,"So watch, my children! and beware that sleep"
8173,BOOK X.,"Invade none here, lest all become a prey."
8174,BOOK X.,"So saying, he traversed with quick pace the trench"
8175,BOOK X.,By every Chief whom they had thither call’d230
8176,BOOK X.,"Attended, with whom Nestor’s noble son"
8177,BOOK X.,"Went, and Meriones, invited both"
8178,BOOK X.,To join their consultation. From the foss
8179,BOOK X.,"Emerging, in a vacant space they sat,"
8180,BOOK X.,"Unstrew’d with bodies of the slain, the spot,235"
8181,BOOK X.,"Whence furious Hector, after slaughter made"
8182,BOOK X.,"Of numerous Greeks, night falling, had return’d."
8183,BOOK X.,"There seated, mutual converse close they held,"
8184,BOOK X.,"And Nestor, brave Gerenian, thus began."
8185,BOOK X.,
8186,BOOK X.,Oh friends! hath no Achaian here such trust240
8187,BOOK X.,"In his own prowess, as to venture forth"
8188,BOOK X.,"Among yon haughty Trojans? He, perchance,"
8189,BOOK X.,Might on the borders of their host surprise
8190,BOOK X.,"Some wandering adversary, or might learn"
8191,BOOK X.,"Their consultations, whether they propose245"
8192,BOOK X.,"Here to abide in prospect of the fleet,"
8193,BOOK X.,"Or, satiate with success against the Greeks"
8194,BOOK X.,"So signal, meditate retreat to Troy."
8195,BOOK X.,"These tidings gain’d, should he at last return"
8196,BOOK X.,"Secure, his recompense will be renown250"
8197,BOOK X.,"Extensive as the heavens, and fair reward."
8198,BOOK X.,"From every leader of the fleet, his gift"
8199,BOOK X.,"Shall be a sable[6] ewe, and sucking lamb,"
8200,BOOK X.,Rare acquisition! and at every board
8201,BOOK X.,"And sumptuous banquet, he shall be a guest.255"
8202,BOOK X.,"He ceased, and all sat silent, when at length"
8203,BOOK X.,The mighty son of Tydeus thus replied.
8204,BOOK X.,"Me, Nestor, my courageous heart incites"
8205,BOOK X.,To penetrate into the neighbor host
8206,BOOK X.,Of enemies; but went some other Chief260
8207,BOOK X.,"With me, far greater would my comfort prove,"
8208,BOOK X.,"And I should dare the more. Two going forth,"
8209,BOOK X.,"One quicker sees than other, and suggests"
8210,BOOK X.,"Prudent advice; but he who single goes,"
8211,BOOK X.,"Mark whatsoe’er he may, the occasion less265"
8212,BOOK X.,"Improves, and his expedients soon exhausts."
8213,BOOK X.,"He ended, and no few willing arose"
8214,BOOK X.,To go with Diomede. Servants of Mars
8215,BOOK X.,Each Ajax willing stood; willing as they
8216,BOOK X.,Meriones; most willing Nestor’s son;270
8217,BOOK X.,"Willing the brother of the Chief of all,"
8218,BOOK X.,Nor willing less Ulysses to explore
8219,BOOK X.,"The host of Troy, for he possess’d a heart"
8220,BOOK X.,Delighted ever with some bold exploit.
8221,BOOK X.,"Then Agamemnon, King of men, began.275"
8222,BOOK X.,"Now Diomede, in whom my soul delights!"
8223,BOOK X.,Choose whom thou wilt for thy companion; choose
8224,BOOK X.,The fittest here; for numerous wish to go.
8225,BOOK X.,"Leave not through deference to another’s rank,"
8226,BOOK X.,"The more deserving, nor prefer a worse,280"
8227,BOOK X.,Respecting either pedigree or power.
8228,BOOK X.,"Such speech he interposed, fearing his choice"
8229,BOOK X.,"Of Menelaus; then, renown’d in arms"
8230,BOOK X.,"The son of Tydeus, rising, spake again."
8231,BOOK X.,"Since, then, ye bid me my own partner choose285"
8232,BOOK X.,"Free from constraint, how can I overlook"
8233,BOOK X.,"Divine Ulysses, whose courageous heart"
8234,BOOK X.,With such peculiar cheerfulness endures
8235,BOOK X.,"Whatever toils, and whom Minerva loves?"
8236,BOOK X.,"Let _him_ attend me, and through fire itself290"
8237,BOOK X.,We shall return; for none is wise as he.[7]
8238,BOOK X.,"To him Ulysses, hardy Chief, replied."
8239,BOOK X.,"Tydides! neither praise me much, nor blame,"
8240,BOOK X.,"For these are Grecians in whose ears thou speak’st,"
8241,BOOK X.,And know me well. But let us hence! the night295
8242,BOOK X.,Draws to a close; day comes apace; the stars
8243,BOOK X.,Are far advanced; two portions have elapsed
8244,BOOK X.,"Of darkness, but the third is yet entire."
8245,BOOK X.,So they; then each his dreadful arms put on.
8246,BOOK X.,"To Diomede, who at the fleet had left300"
8247,BOOK X.,"His own, the dauntless Thrasymedes gave"
8248,BOOK X.,"His shield and sword two-edged, and on his head"
8249,BOOK X.,"Placed, crestless, unadorn’d, his bull-skin casque."
8250,BOOK X.,"It was a stripling’s helmet, such as youths"
8251,BOOK X.,"Scarce yet confirm’d in lusty manhood, wear.305"
8252,BOOK X.,"Meriones with quiver, bow and sword"
8253,BOOK X.,"Furnish’d Ulysses, and his brows enclosed"
8254,BOOK X.,In his own casque of hide with many a thong
8255,BOOK X.,Well braced within;[8] guarded it was without
8256,BOOK X.,With boar’s teeth ivory-white inherent firm310
8257,BOOK X.,"On all sides, and with woolen head-piece lined."
8258,BOOK X.,That helmet erst Autolycus[9] had brought
8259,BOOK X.,"From Eleon, city of Amyntor son"
8260,BOOK X.,"Of Hormenus, where he the solid walls"
8261,BOOK X.,"Bored through, clandestine, of Amyntor’s house.315"
8262,BOOK X.,He on Amphidamas the prize bestow’d
8263,BOOK X.,In Scandia;[10] from Amphidamas it pass’d
8264,BOOK X.,To Molus as a hospitable pledge;
8265,BOOK X.,"He gave it to Meriones his son,"
8266,BOOK X.,And now it guarded shrewd Ulysses’ brows.320
8267,BOOK X.,"Both clad in arms terrific, forth they sped,"
8268,BOOK X.,"Leaving their fellow Chiefs, and as they went"
8269,BOOK X.,"A heron, by command of Pallas, flew"
8270,BOOK X.,Close on the right beside them; darkling they
8271,BOOK X.,"Discern’d him not, but heard his clanging plumes.[11]325"
8272,BOOK X.,Ulysses in the favorable sign
8273,BOOK X.,"Exulted, and Minerva thus invoked.[12]"
8274,BOOK X.,
8275,BOOK X.,"Oh hear me, daughter of Jove Ægis-arm’d!"
8276,BOOK X.,"My present helper in all straits, whose eye"
8277,BOOK X.,"Marks all my ways, oh with peculiar care330"
8278,BOOK X.,"Now guard me, Pallas! grant that after toil"
8279,BOOK X.,"Successful, glorious, such as long shall fill"
8280,BOOK X.,"With grief the Trojans, we may safe return"
8281,BOOK X.,And with immortal honors to the fleet.
8282,BOOK X.,"Valiant Tydides, next, his prayer preferr’d.335"
8283,BOOK X.,"Hear also me, Jove’s offspring by the toils"
8284,BOOK X.,Of war invincible! me follow now
8285,BOOK X.,As my heroic father erst to Thebes
8286,BOOK X.,"Thou followedst, Tydeus; by the Greeks dispatch’d"
8287,BOOK X.,"Ambassador, he left the mail-clad host340"
8288,BOOK X.,"Beside Asopus, and with terms of peace"
8289,BOOK X.,"Entrusted, enter’d Thebes; but by thine aid"
8290,BOOK X.,"Benevolent, and in thy strength, perform’d"
8291,BOOK X.,"Returning, deeds of terrible renown."
8292,BOOK X.,"Thus, now, protect me also! In return345"
8293,BOOK X.,"I vow an offering at thy shrine, a young"
8294,BOOK X.,"Broad-fronted heifer, to the yoke as yet"
8295,BOOK X.,"Untamed, whose horns I will incase with gold."
8296,BOOK X.,"Such prayer they made, and Pallas heard well pleased."
8297,BOOK X.,Their orisons ended to the daughter dread350
8298,BOOK X.,"Of mighty Jove, lion-like they advanced"
8299,BOOK X.,"Through shades of night, through carnage, arms and blood."
8300,BOOK X.,Nor Hector to his gallant host indulged
8301,BOOK X.,"Sleep, but convened the leaders; leader none"
8302,BOOK X.,Or senator of all his host he left355
8303,BOOK X.,"Unsummon’d, and his purpose thus promulged."
8304,BOOK X.,"Where is the warrior who for rich reward,"
8305,BOOK X.,"Such as shall well suffice him, will the task"
8306,BOOK X.,"Adventurous, which I propose, perform?"
8307,BOOK X.,"A chariot with two steeds of proudest height,360"
8308,BOOK X.,Surpassing all in the whole fleet of Greece
8309,BOOK X.,"Shall be his portion, with immortal praise,"
8310,BOOK X.,Who shall the well-appointed ships approach
8311,BOOK X.,"Courageous, there to learn if yet a guard"
8312,BOOK X.,"As heretofore, keep them, or if subdued365"
8313,BOOK X.,"Beneath us, the Achaians flight intend,"
8314,BOOK X.,And worn with labor have no will to watch.
8315,BOOK X.,"So Hector spake, but answer none return’d."
8316,BOOK X.,"There was a certain Trojan, Dolon named,[13]"
8317,BOOK X.,"Son of Eumedes herald of the Gods,370"
8318,BOOK X.,"Rich both in gold and brass, but in his form"
8319,BOOK X.,"Unsightly; yet the man was swift of foot,"
8320,BOOK X.,Sole brother of five sisters; he his speech
8321,BOOK X.,To Hector and the Trojans thus address’d.
8322,BOOK X.,"My spirit, Hector, prompts me, and my mind375"
8323,BOOK X.,"Endued with manly vigor, to approach"
8324,BOOK X.,"Yon gallant ships, that I may tidings hear."
8325,BOOK X.,"But come. For my assurance, lifting high"
8326,BOOK X.,"Thy sceptre, swear to me, for my reward,"
8327,BOOK X.,The horses and the brazen chariot bright380
8328,BOOK X.,Which bear renown’d Achilles o’er the field.
8329,BOOK X.,"I will not prove a useless spy, nor fall"
8330,BOOK X.,Below thy best opinion; pass I will
8331,BOOK X.,"Their army through, till I shall reach the ship"
8332,BOOK X.,"Of Agamemnon, where the Chiefs, perchance,385"
8333,BOOK X.,"Now sit consulting, or to fight, or fly.[14]"
8334,BOOK X.,
8335,BOOK X.,"Then raising high his sceptre, Hector sware"
8336,BOOK X.,"Know, Jove himself, Juno’s high-thundering spouse!"
8337,BOOK X.,That Trojan none shall in that chariot ride
8338,BOOK X.,"By those steeds drawn, save Dolon; on my oath390"
8339,BOOK X.,I make them thine; enjoy them evermore.
8340,BOOK X.,"He said, and falsely sware, yet him assured."
8341,BOOK X.,"Then Dolon, instant, o’er his shoulder slung"
8342,BOOK X.,"His bow elastic, wrapp’d himself around"
8343,BOOK X.,"With a grey wolf-skin, to his head a casque395"
8344,BOOK X.,"Adjusted, coated o’er with ferret’s felt,"
8345,BOOK X.,"And seizing his sharp javelin, from the host"
8346,BOOK X.,"Turn’d right toward the fleet, but was ordain’d"
8347,BOOK X.,"To disappoint his sender, and to bring"
8348,BOOK X.,No tidings thence. The throng of Trojan steeds400
8349,BOOK X.,"And warriors left, with brisker pace he moved,"
8350,BOOK X.,"When brave Ulysses his approach perceived,"
8351,BOOK X.,And thus to Diomede his speech address’d.
8352,BOOK X.,Tydides! yonder man is from the host;
8353,BOOK X.,"Either a spy he comes, or with intent405"
8354,BOOK X.,"To spoil the dead. First, freely let him pass"
8355,BOOK X.,"Few paces, then pursuing him with speed,"
8356,BOOK X.,Seize on him suddenly; but should he prove
8357,BOOK X.,"The nimbler of the three, with threatening spear"
8358,BOOK X.,"Enforce him from his camp toward the fleet,410"
8359,BOOK X.,"Lest he elude us, and escape to Troy."
8360,BOOK X.,"So they; then, turning from the road oblique,"
8361,BOOK X.,Among the carcases each laid him down.
8362,BOOK X.,"Dolon, suspecting nought, ran swiftly by."
8363,BOOK X.,[15]But when such space was interposed as mules415
8364,BOOK X.,Plow in a day (for mules the ox surpass
8365,BOOK X.,Through fallows deep drawing the ponderous plow)
8366,BOOK X.,Both ran toward him. Dolon at the sound
8367,BOOK X.,Stood; for he hoped some Trojan friends at hand
8368,BOOK X.,From Hector sent to bid him back again.420
8369,BOOK X.,"But when within spear’s cast, or less they came,"
8370,BOOK X.,Knowing them enemies he turn’d to flight
8371,BOOK X.,"Incontinent, whom they as swift pursued."
8372,BOOK X.,"As two fleet hounds sharp fang’d, train’d to the chase,"
8373,BOOK X.,"Hang on the rear of flying hind or hare,425"
8374,BOOK X.,"And drive her, never swerving from the track,"
8375,BOOK X.,Through copses close; she screaming scuds before;
8376,BOOK X.,So Diomede and dread Ulysses him
8377,BOOK X.,"Chased constant, intercepting his return."
8378,BOOK X.,"And now, fast-fleeting to the ships, he soon430"
8379,BOOK X.,"Had reach’d the guard, but Pallas with new force"
8380,BOOK X.,"Inspired Tydides, lest a meaner Greek"
8381,BOOK X.,"Should boast that he had smitten Dolon first,"
8382,BOOK X.,And Diomede win only second praise.
8383,BOOK X.,"He poised his lifted spear, and thus exclaim’d.435"
8384,BOOK X.,Stand! or my spear shall stop thee. Death impends
8385,BOOK X.,At every step; thou canst not ’scape me long.
8386,BOOK X.,"He said, and threw his spear, but by design,"
8387,BOOK X.,Err’d from the man. The polish’d weapon swift
8388,BOOK X.,"O’er-glancing his right shoulder, in the soil440"
8389,BOOK X.,"Stood fixt, beyond him. Terrified he stood,"
8390,BOOK X.,"Stammering, and sounding through his lips the clash"
8391,BOOK X.,"Of chattering teeth, with visage deadly wan."
8392,BOOK X.,"They panting rush’d on him, and both his hands"
8393,BOOK X.,"Seized fast; he wept, and suppliant them bespake.445"
8394,BOOK X.,"Take me alive, and I will pay the price"
8395,BOOK X.,"Of my redemption. I have gold at home,"
8396,BOOK X.,"Brass also, and bright steel, and when report"
8397,BOOK X.,Of my captivity within your fleet
8398,BOOK X.,"Shall reach my father, treasures he will give450"
8399,BOOK X.,"Not to be told, for ransom of his son."
8400,BOOK X.,To whom Ulysses politic replied.
8401,BOOK X.,Take courage; entertain no thought of death.[16]
8402,BOOK X.,"But haste! this tell me, and disclose the truth."
8403,BOOK X.,Why thus toward the ships comest thou alone455
8404,BOOK X.,"From yonder host, by night, while others sleep?"
8405,BOOK X.,To spoil some carcase? or from Hector sent
8406,BOOK X.,A spy of all that passes in the fleet?
8407,BOOK X.,Or by thy curiosity impell’d?
8408,BOOK X.,"Then Dolon, his limbs trembling, thus replied.460"
8409,BOOK X.,"To my great detriment, and far beyond"
8410,BOOK X.,"My own design, Hector trepann’d me forth,"
8411,BOOK X.,Who promised me the steeds of Peleus’ son
8412,BOOK X.,"Illustrious, and his brazen chariot bright."
8413,BOOK X.,"He bade me, under night’s fast-flitting shades465"
8414,BOOK X.,"Approach our enemies, a spy, to learn"
8415,BOOK X.,"If still as heretofore, ye station guards"
8416,BOOK X.,"For safety of your fleet, or if subdued"
8417,BOOK X.,"Completely, ye intend immediate flight,"
8418,BOOK X.,"And worn with labor, have no will to watch.470"
8419,BOOK X.,"To whom Ulysses, smiling, thus replied."
8420,BOOK X.,"Thou hadst, in truth, an appetite to gifts"
8421,BOOK X.,"Of no mean value, coveting the steeds"
8422,BOOK X.,Of brave Æacides; but steeds are they
8423,BOOK X.,"Of fiery sort, difficult to be ruled475"
8424,BOOK X.,"By force of mortal man, Achilles’ self"
8425,BOOK X.,"Except, whom an immortal mother bore."
8426,BOOK X.,But tell me yet again; use no disguise;
8427,BOOK X.,"Where left’st thou, at thy coming forth, your Chief,"
8428,BOOK X.,The valiant Hector? where hath he disposed480
8429,BOOK X.,"His armor battle-worn, and where his steeds?"
8430,BOOK X.,What other quar4ers of your host are watch’d?
8431,BOOK X.,"Where lodge the guard, and what intend ye next?"
8432,BOOK X.,Still to abide in prospect of the fleet?
8433,BOOK X.,Or well-content that ye have thus reduced485
8434,BOOK X.,"Achaia’s host, will ye retire to Troy?"
8435,BOOK X.,To whom this answer Dolon straight returned
8436,BOOK X.,Son of Eumedes. With unfeigning truth
8437,BOOK X.,Simply and plainly will I utter all.
8438,BOOK X.,"Hector, with all the Senatorial Chiefs,490"
8439,BOOK X.,Beside the tomb of sacred Ilius sits
8440,BOOK X.,"Consulting, from the noisy camp remote."
8441,BOOK X.,"But for the guards, Hero! concerning whom"
8442,BOOK X.,"Thou hast inquired, there is no certain watch"
8443,BOOK X.,And regular appointed o’er the camp;495
8444,BOOK X.,The native[17] Trojans (for _they_ can no less)
8445,BOOK X.,"Sit sleepless all, and each his next exhorts"
8446,BOOK X.,"To vigilance; but all our foreign aids,"
8447,BOOK X.,"Who neither wives nor children hazard here,"
8448,BOOK X.,"Trusting the Trojans for that service, sleep.500"
8449,BOOK X.,"To whom Ulysses, ever wise, replied."
8450,BOOK X.,How sleep the strangers and allies?—apart?
8451,BOOK X.,Or with the Trojans mingled?—I would learn.
8452,BOOK X.,"So spake Ulysses; to whom Dolon thus,"
8453,BOOK X.,"Son of Eumedes. I will all unfold,505"
8454,BOOK X.,And all most truly. By the sea are lodged
8455,BOOK X.,"The Carians, the Pæonians arm’d with bows,"
8456,BOOK X.,"The Leleges, with the Pelasgian band,"
8457,BOOK X.,And the Caucones. On the skirts encamp
8458,BOOK X.,"Of Thymbra, the Mæonians crested high,510"
8459,BOOK X.,"The Phrygian horsemen, with the Lycian host,"
8460,BOOK X.,And the bold troop of Mysia’s haughty sons.
8461,BOOK X.,But wherefore these inquiries thus minu4e?
8462,BOOK X.,"For if ye wish to penetrate the host,"
8463,BOOK X.,These who possess the borders of the camp515
8464,BOOK X.,"Farthest removed of all, are Thracian powers"
8465,BOOK X.,"Newly arrived; among them Rhesus sleeps,"
8466,BOOK X.,"Son of Eïoneus, their Chief and King."
8467,BOOK X.,"His steeds I saw, the fairest by these eyes"
8468,BOOK X.,"Ever beheld, and loftiest; snow itself520"
8469,BOOK X.,"They pass in whiteness, and in speed the winds,"
8470,BOOK X.,"With gold and silver all his chariot burns,"
8471,BOOK X.,And he arrived in golden armor clad
8472,BOOK X.,Stupendous! little suited to the state
8473,BOOK X.,Of mortal man—fit for a God to wear!525
8474,BOOK X.,"Now, either lead me to your gallant fleet,"
8475,BOOK X.,Or where ye find me leave me straitly bound
8476,BOOK X.,"Till ye return, and after trial made,"
8477,BOOK X.,Shall know if I have spoken false or true.
8478,BOOK X.,
8479,BOOK X.,But him brave Diomede with aspect stern530
8480,BOOK X.,"Answer’d. Since, Dolon! thou art caught, although"
8481,BOOK X.,"Thy tidings have been good, hope not to live;"
8482,BOOK X.,"For should we now release thee and dismiss,"
8483,BOOK X.,Thou wilt revisit yet again the fleet
8484,BOOK X.,A spy or open foe; but smitten once535
8485,BOOK X.,"By this death-dealing arm, thou shall return"
8486,BOOK X.,To render mischief to the Greeks no more.
8487,BOOK X.,"He ceased, and Dolon would have stretch’d his hand"
8488,BOOK X.,"Toward his beard, and pleaded hard for life,"
8489,BOOK X.,"But with his falchion, rising to the blow,540"
8490,BOOK X.,"On the mid-neck he smote him, cutting sheer"
8491,BOOK X.,"Both tendons with a stroke so swift, that ere"
8492,BOOK X.,"His tongue had ceased, his head was in the dust.[18]"
8493,BOOK X.,"They took his helmet clothed with ferret’s felt,"
8494,BOOK X.,"Stripp’d off his wolf-skin, seized his bow and spear,545"
8495,BOOK X.,And brave Ulysses lifting in his hand
8496,BOOK X.,"The trophy to Minerva, pray’d and said:"
8497,BOOK X.,Hail Goddess; these are thine! for thee of all
8498,BOOK X.,"Who in Olympus dwell, we will invoke"
8499,BOOK X.,"First to our aid. Now also guide our steps,550"
8500,BOOK X.,"Propitious, to the Thracian tents and steeds."
8501,BOOK X.,"He ceased, and at arm’s-length the lifted spoils"
8502,BOOK X.,"Hung on a tamarisk; but mark’d the spot,"
8503,BOOK X.,Plucking away with handful grasp the reeds
8504,BOOK X.,"And spreading boughs, lest they should seek the prize555"
8505,BOOK X.,"Themselves in vain, returning ere the night,"
8506,BOOK X.,"Swift traveller, should have fled before the dawn."
8507,BOOK X.,"Thence, o’er the bloody champain strew’d with arms"
8508,BOOK X.,"Proceeding, to the Thracian lines they came."
8509,BOOK X.,"They, wearied, slept profound; beside them lay,560"
8510,BOOK X.,"In triple order regular arranged,"
8511,BOOK X.,"Their radiant armor, and their steeds in pairs."
8512,BOOK X.,"Amid them Rhesus slept, and at his side"
8513,BOOK X.,"His coursers, to the outer chariot-ring"
8514,BOOK X.,"Fasten’d secure. Ulysses saw him first,565"
8515,BOOK X.,"And, seeing, mark’d him out to Diomede."
8516,BOOK X.,"Behold the man, Tydides! Lo! the steeds"
8517,BOOK X.,By Dolon specified whom we have slain.
8518,BOOK X.,"Be quick. Exert thy force. Arm’d as thou art,"
8519,BOOK X.,"Sleep not. Loose thou the steeds, or slaughter thou570"
8520,BOOK X.,"The Thracians, and the steeds shall be my care."
8521,BOOK X.,He ceased; then blue-eyed Pallas with fresh force
8522,BOOK X.,Invigor’d Diomede. From side to side
8523,BOOK X.,He slew; dread groans arose of dying men
8524,BOOK X.,"Hewn with the sword, and the earth swam with blood.575"
8525,BOOK X.,"As if he find a flock unguarded, sheep"
8526,BOOK X.,"Or goats, the lion rushes on his prey,"
8527,BOOK X.,With such unsparing force Tydides smote
8528,BOOK X.,"The men of Thrace, till he had slaughter’d twelve;"
8529,BOOK X.,And whom Tydides with his falchion struck580
8530,BOOK X.,"Laertes’ son dragg’d by his feet abroad,"
8531,BOOK X.,"Forecasting that the steeds might pass with ease,"
8532,BOOK X.,"Nor start, as yet uncustom’d to the dead."
8533,BOOK X.,"But when the son of Tydeus found the King,"
8534,BOOK X.,"Him also panting forth his last, last, breath,585"
8535,BOOK X.,He added to the twelve; for at his head
8536,BOOK X.,"An evil dream that night had stood, the form"
8537,BOOK X.,"Of Diomede, by Pallas’ art devised."
8538,BOOK X.,"Meantime, the bold Ulysses loosed the steeds,"
8539,BOOK X.,"Which, to each other rein’d, he drove abroad,590"
8540,BOOK X.,Smiting them with his bow (for of the scourge
8541,BOOK X.,He thought not in the chariot-seat secured)
8542,BOOK X.,"And as he went, hiss’d, warning Diomede."
8543,BOOK X.,"But he, projecting still some hardier deed,"
8544,BOOK X.,"Stood doubtful, whether by the pole to draw595"
8545,BOOK X.,"The chariot thence, laden with gorgeous arms,"
8546,BOOK X.,"Or whether heaving it on high, to bear"
8547,BOOK X.,"The burthen off, or whether yet to take"
8548,BOOK X.,More Thracian lives; when him with various thoughts
8549,BOOK X.,"Perplex’d, Minerva, drawing near, bespake.600"
8550,BOOK X.,Son of bold Tydeus! think on thy return
8551,BOOK X.,"To yonder fleet, lest thou depart constrain’d."
8552,BOOK X.,Some other God may rouse the powers of Troy.
8553,BOOK X.,"She ended, and he knew the voice divine."
8554,BOOK X.,At once he mounted. With his bow the steeds605
8555,BOOK X.,"Ulysses plyed, and to the ships they flew."
8556,BOOK X.,"Nor look’d the bender of the silver bow,"
8557,BOOK X.,"Apollo, forth in vain, but at the sight"
8558,BOOK X.,"Of Pallas following Diomede incensed,"
8559,BOOK X.,Descended to the field where numerous most610
8560,BOOK X.,"He saw the Trojans, and the Thracian Chief"
8561,BOOK X.,"And counsellor, Hippocoön aroused,[19]"
8562,BOOK X.,"Kinsman of Rhesus, and renown’d in arms."
8563,BOOK X.,"He, starting from his sleep, soon as he saw"
8564,BOOK X.,The spot deserted where so lately lay615
8565,BOOK X.,"Those fiery coursers, and his warrior friends"
8566,BOOK X.,"Gasping around him, sounded loud the name"
8567,BOOK X.,"Of his loved Rhesus. Instant, at the voice,"
8568,BOOK X.,Wild stir arose and clamorous uproar
8569,BOOK X.,Of fast-assembling Trojans. Deeds they saw—620
8570,BOOK X.,"Terrible deeds, and marvellous perform’d,"
8571,BOOK X.,But not their authors—they had sought the ships.
8572,BOOK X.,Meantime arrived where they had slain the spy
8573,BOOK X.,"Of Hector, there Ulysses, dear to Jove,"
8574,BOOK X.,"The coursers stay’d, and, leaping to the ground,625"
8575,BOOK X.,The son of Tydeus in Ulysses’ hands
8576,BOOK X.,"The arms of Dolon placed foul with his blood,"
8577,BOOK X.,Then vaulted light into his seat again.
8578,BOOK X.,"He lash’d the steeds, they, not unwilling, flew"
8579,BOOK X.,"To the deep-bellied barks, as to their home.630"
8580,BOOK X.,"First Nestor heard the sound, and thus he said."
8581,BOOK X.,Friends! Counsellors! and leaders of the Greeks!
8582,BOOK X.,"False shall I speak, or true?—but speak I must."
8583,BOOK X.,The echoing sound of hoofs alarms my ear.
8584,BOOK X.,"Oh, that Ulysses, and brave Diomede635"
8585,BOOK X.,This moment might arrive drawn into camp
8586,BOOK X.,"By Trojan steeds! But, ah, the dread I feel!"
8587,BOOK X.,Lest some disaster have for ever quell’d
8588,BOOK X.,In yon rude host those noblest of the Greeks.
8589,BOOK X.,"He hath not ended, when themselves arrived,640"
8590,BOOK X.,Both quick dismounted; joy at their return
8591,BOOK X.,Fill’d every bosom; each with kind salute
8592,BOOK X.,"Cordial, and right-hand welcome greeted them,"
8593,BOOK X.,And first Gerenian Nestor thus inquired.
8594,BOOK X.,"Oh Chief by all extoll’d, glory of Greece,645"
8595,BOOK X.,Ulysses! how have ye these steeds acquired?
8596,BOOK X.,In yonder host? or met ye as ye went
8597,BOOK X.,Some God who gave them to you? for they show
8598,BOOK X.,A lustre dazzling as the beams of day.
8599,BOOK X.,"Old as I am, I mingle yet in fight650"
8600,BOOK X.,With Ilium’s sons—lurk never in the fleet—
8601,BOOK X.,"Yet saw I at no time, or have remark’d"
8602,BOOK X.,Steeds such as these; which therefore I believe
8603,BOOK X.,"Perforce, that ye have gained by gift divine;"
8604,BOOK X.,"For cloud-assembler Jove, and azure-eyed655"
8605,BOOK X.,"Minerva, Jove’s own daughter, love you both."
8606,BOOK X.,"To whom Ulysses, thus, discreet, replied."
8607,BOOK X.,"Neleian Nestor, glory of the Greeks!"
8608,BOOK X.,"A God, so willing, could have given us steeds"
8609,BOOK X.,"Superior, for their bounty knows no bounds.660"
8610,BOOK X.,"But, venerable Chief! these which thou seest"
8611,BOOK X.,Are Thracians new-arrived. Their master lies
8612,BOOK X.,"Slain by the valiant Diomede, with twelve"
8613,BOOK X.,"The noblest of his warriors at his side,"
8614,BOOK X.,"A thirteenth[20] also, at small distance hence665"
8615,BOOK X.,"We slew, by Hector and the Chiefs of Troy"
8616,BOOK X.,Sent to inspect the posture of our host.
8617,BOOK X.,"He said; then, high in exultation, drove"
8618,BOOK X.,"The coursers o’er the trench, and with him pass’d"
8619,BOOK X.,The glad Achaians; at the spacious tent670
8620,BOOK X.,"Of Diomede arrived, with even thongs"
8621,BOOK X.,They tied them at the cribs where stood the steeds
8622,BOOK X.,"Of Tydeus’ son, with winnow’d wheat supplied."
8623,BOOK X.,Ulysses in his bark the gory spoils
8624,BOOK X.,"Of Dolon placed, designing them a gift675"
8625,BOOK X.,"To Pallas. Then, descending to the sea,"
8626,BOOK X.,"Neck, thighs, and legs from sweat profuse they cleansed,"
8627,BOOK X.,"And, so refresh’d and purified, their last"
8628,BOOK X.,Ablution in bright tepid baths perform’d.
8629,BOOK X.,"Each thus completely laved, and with smooth oil680"
8630,BOOK X.,"Anointed, at the well-spread board they sat,"
8631,BOOK X.,"And quaff’d, in honor of Minerva, wine"
8632,BOOK X.,"Delicious, from the brimming beaker drawn."

8634,BOOK X.,
8635,BOOK X.,The vividness of the scenes presented to us in this Book constitute its
8636,BOOK X.,chief beauty. The reader sees the most natural night-scene in the
8637,BOOK X.,"world. He is led step by step with the adventurers, and made the"
8638,BOOK X.,companion of all their expectations and uncertainties. We see the very
8639,BOOK X.,color of the sky; know the time to a minute; are impatient while the
8640,BOOK X.,"heroes are arming; our imagination follows them, knows all their"
8641,BOOK X.,"doubts, and even the secret wishes of their hearts sent up to Minerva."
8642,BOOK X.,"We are alarmed at the approach of Dolon, hear his very footsteps,"
8643,BOOK X.,"assist the two chiefs in pursuing him, and stop just with the spear"
8644,BOOK X.,that arrests him. We are perfectly acquainted with the situation of all
8645,BOOK X.,"the forces, with the figure in which they lie, with the disposition of"
8646,BOOK X.,"Rhesus and the Thracians, with the posture of his chariot and horses."
8647,BOOK X.,"The marshy spot of ground where Dolon is killed, the tamarisk, or"
8648,BOOK X.,"aquatic plant upon which they hung his spoils, and the reeds that are"
8649,BOOK X.,"heaped together to mark the place, are circumstances the most"
8650,BOOK X.,picturesque imaginable.

8788,BOOK XI.,"Oïleus, with a leap alighting, rush’d"
8789,BOOK XI.,On Agamemnon; he his fierce assault
8790,BOOK XI.,"Encountering, with a spear met full his front."
8791,BOOK XI.,Nor could his helmet’s ponderous brass sustain
8792,BOOK XI.,"That force, but both his helmet and his skull120"
8793,BOOK XI.,"It shatter’d, and his martial rage repress’d."
8794,BOOK XI.,"The King of men, stripping their corselets, bared"
8795,BOOK XI.,"Their shining breasts, and left them. Isus, next,"
8796,BOOK XI.,"And Antiphus he flew to slay, the sons"
8797,BOOK XI.,"Of Priam both, and in one chariot borne,125"
8798,BOOK XI.,"This spurious, genuine that. The bastard drove,"
8799,BOOK XI.,"And Antiphus, a warrior high-renown’d,"
8800,BOOK XI.,Fought from the chariot; them Achilles erst
8801,BOOK XI.,Feeding their flocks on Ida had surprised
8802,BOOK XI.,"And bound with osiers, but for ransom loosed.130"
8803,BOOK XI.,"Of these, imperial Agamemnon, first,"
8804,BOOK XI.,"Above the pap pierced Isus; next, he smote"
8805,BOOK XI.,"Antiphus with his sword beside the ear,"
8806,BOOK XI.,And from his chariot cast him to the ground.
8807,BOOK XI.,"Conscious of both, their glittering arms he stripp’d,135"
8808,BOOK XI.,For he had seen them when from Ida’s heights
8809,BOOK XI.,Achilles led them to the Grecian fleet.
8810,BOOK XI.,As with resistless fangs the lion breaks
8811,BOOK XI.,"The young in pieces of the nimble hind,"
8812,BOOK XI.,"Entering her lair, and takes their feeble lives;140"
8813,BOOK XI.,"She, though at hand, can yield them no defence,"
8814,BOOK XI.,"But through the thick wood, wing’d with terror, starts"
8815,BOOK XI.,"Herself away, trembling at such a foe;"
8816,BOOK XI.,"So them the Trojans had no power to save,"
8817,BOOK XI.,Themselves all driven before the host of Greece.145
8818,BOOK XI.,"Next, on Pisandrus, and of dauntless heart"
8819,BOOK XI.,Hippolochus he rush’d; they were the sons
8820,BOOK XI.,"Of brave Antimachus, who with rich gifts"
8821,BOOK XI.,"By Paris bought, inflexible withheld"
8822,BOOK XI.,From Menelaus still his lovely bride.150
8823,BOOK XI.,"His sons, the monarch, in one chariot borne"
8824,BOOK XI.,Encounter’d; they (for they had lost the reins)
8825,BOOK XI.,With trepidation and united force
8826,BOOK XI.,Essay’d to check the steeds; astonishment
8827,BOOK XI.,Seized both; Atrides with a lion’s rage155
8828,BOOK XI.,"Came on, and from the chariot thus they sued."
8829,BOOK XI.,"Oh spare us! son of Atreus, and accept"
8830,BOOK XI.,Ransom immense. Antimachus our sire
8831,BOOK XI.,"Is rich in various treasure, gold and brass,"
8832,BOOK XI.,"And temper’d steel, and, hearing the report160"
8833,BOOK XI.,"That in Achaia’s fleet his sons survive,"
8834,BOOK XI.,He will requite thee with a glorious price.
8835,BOOK XI.,"So they, with tears and gentle terms the King"
8836,BOOK XI.,"Accosted, but no gentle answer heard."
8837,BOOK XI.,Are ye indeed the offspring of the Chief165
8838,BOOK XI.,"Antimachus, who when my brother once"
8839,BOOK XI.,With godlike Laertiades your town
8840,BOOK XI.,"Enter’d ambassador, his death advised"
8841,BOOK XI.,"In council, and to let him forth no more?"
8842,BOOK XI.,Now rue ye both the baseness of your sire.170
8843,BOOK XI.,"He said, and from his chariot to the plain"
8844,BOOK XI.,"Thrust down Pisandrus, piercing with keen lance"
8845,BOOK XI.,"His bosom, and supine he smote the field."
8846,BOOK XI.,"Down leap’d Hippolochus, whom on the ground"
8847,BOOK XI.,"He slew, cut sheer his hands, and lopp’d his head,175"
8848,BOOK XI.,And roll’d it like a mortar[9] through the ranks.
8849,BOOK XI.,"He left the slain, and where he saw the field"
8850,BOOK XI.,"With thickest battle cover’d, thither flew"
8851,BOOK XI.,By all the Grecians follow’d bright in arms.
8852,BOOK XI.,"The scatter’d infantry constrained to fly,180"
8853,BOOK XI.,"Fell by the infantry; the charioteers,"
8854,BOOK XI.,While with loud hoofs their steeds the dusty soil
8855,BOOK XI.,"Excited, o’er the charioteers their wheels"
8856,BOOK XI.,"Drove brazen-fellied, and the King of men"
8857,BOOK XI.,"Incessant slaughtering, called his Argives[10] on.185"
8858,BOOK XI.,"As when fierce flames some ancient forest seize,"
8859,BOOK XI.,From side to side in flakes the various wind
8860,BOOK XI.,"Rolls them, and to the roots devour’d, the trunks"
8861,BOOK XI.,"Fall prostrate under fury of the fire,"
8862,BOOK XI.,So under Agamemnon fell the heads190
8863,BOOK XI.,Of flying Trojans. Many a courser proud
8864,BOOK XI.,The empty chariots through the paths of war
8865,BOOK XI.,"Whirl’d rattling, of their charioteers deprived;"
8866,BOOK XI.,"They breathless press’d the plain, now fitter far"
8867,BOOK XI.,To feed the vultures than to cheer their wives.195
8868,BOOK XI.,"Conceal’d, meantime, by Jove, Hector escaped"
8869,BOOK XI.,"The dust, darts, deaths, and tumult of the field;"
8870,BOOK XI.,And Agamemnon to the swift pursuit
8871,BOOK XI.,Call’d loud the Grecians. Through the middle plain
8872,BOOK XI.,"Beside the sepulchre of Ilus, son200"
8873,BOOK XI.,"Of Dardanus, and where the fig-tree stood,"
8874,BOOK XI.,"The Trojans flew, panting to gain the town,"
8875,BOOK XI.,"While Agamemnon pressing close the rear,"
8876,BOOK XI.,"Shout after shout terrific sent abroad,"
8877,BOOK XI.,"And his victorious hands reek’d, red with gore.205"
8878,BOOK XI.,But at the beech-tree and the Scæan gate
8879,BOOK XI.,"Arrived, the Trojans halted, waiting there"
8880,BOOK XI.,The rearmost fugitives; they o’er the field
8881,BOOK XI.,"Came like a herd, which in the dead of night"
8882,BOOK XI.,"A lion drives; all fly, but one is doom’d210"
8883,BOOK XI.,To death inevitable; her with jaws
8884,BOOK XI.,"True to their hold he seizes, and her neck"
8885,BOOK XI.,"Breaking, embowels her, and laps the blood;"
8886,BOOK XI.,"So, Atreus’ royal son, the hindmost still"
8887,BOOK XI.,"Slaying, and still pursuing, urged them on.215"
8888,BOOK XI.,"Many supine, and many prone, the field"
8889,BOOK XI.,"Press’d, by the son of Atreus in their flight"
8890,BOOK XI.,Dismounted; for no weapon raged as his.
8891,BOOK XI.,"But now, at last, when he should soon have reach’d"
8892,BOOK XI.,"The lofty walls of Ilium, came the Sire220"
8893,BOOK XI.,"Of Gods and men descending from the skies,"
8894,BOOK XI.,"And on the heights of Ida fountain-fed,"
8895,BOOK XI.,Sat arm’d with thunders. Calling to his foot
8896,BOOK XI.,"Swift Iris golden-pinion’d, thus he spake."
8897,BOOK XI.,Iris! away. Thus speak in Hector’s ears.225
8898,BOOK XI.,While yet he shall the son of Atreus see
8899,BOOK XI.,"Fierce warring in the van, and mowing down"
8900,BOOK XI.,"The Trojan ranks, so long let him abstain"
8901,BOOK XI.,"From battle, leaving to his host the task"
8902,BOOK XI.,Of bloody contest furious with the Greeks.230
8903,BOOK XI.,But soon as Atreus’ son by spear or shaft
8904,BOOK XI.,"Wounded shall climb his chariot, with such force"
8905,BOOK XI.,"I will endue Hector, that he shall slay"
8906,BOOK XI.,"Till he have reach’d the ships, and till, the sun"
8907,BOOK XI.,"Descending, sacred darkness cover all.235"
8908,BOOK XI.,"He spake, nor rapid Iris disobey’d"
8909,BOOK XI.,"Storm-wing’d ambassadress, but from the heights"
8910,BOOK XI.,Of Ida stoop’d to Ilium. There she found
8911,BOOK XI.,The son of royal Priam by the throng
8912,BOOK XI.,Of chariots and of steeds compass’d about240
8913,BOOK XI.,"She, standing at his side, him thus bespake."
8914,BOOK XI.,"Oh, son of Priam! as the Gods discreet!"
8915,BOOK XI.,I bring thee counsel from the Sire of all.
8916,BOOK XI.,While yet thou shalt the son of Atreus see
8917,BOOK XI.,"Fierce warring in the van, and mowing down245"
8918,BOOK XI.,"The warrior ranks, so long he bids thee pause"
8919,BOOK XI.,"From battle, leaving to thy host the task"
8920,BOOK XI.,Of bloody contest furious with the Greeks.
8921,BOOK XI.,"But soon as Atreus’ son, by spear or shaft"
8922,BOOK XI.,"Wounded, shall climb his chariot, Jove will then250"
8923,BOOK XI.,"Endue thee with such force, that thou shalt slay"
8924,BOOK XI.,"Till thou have reach’d the ships, and till, the sun"
8925,BOOK XI.,"Descending, sacred darkness cover all."
8926,BOOK XI.,"So saying, swift-pinion’d Iris disappear’d."
8927,BOOK XI.,Then Hector from his chariot at a leap255
8928,BOOK XI.,"Came down all arm’d, and, shaking his bright spears,"
8929,BOOK XI.,"Ranged every quarter, animating loud"
8930,BOOK XI.,"The legions, and rekindling horrid war."
8931,BOOK XI.,"Back roll’d the Trojan ranks, and faced the Greeks;"
8932,BOOK XI.,The Greeks their host to closer phalanx drew;260
8933,BOOK XI.,"The battle was restored, van fronting van"
8934,BOOK XI.,"They stood, and Agamemnon into fight"
8935,BOOK XI.,"Sprang foremost, panting for superior fame."
8936,BOOK XI.,"Say now, ye Nine, who on Olympus dwell!"
8937,BOOK XI.,"What Trojan first, or what ally of Troy265"
8938,BOOK XI.,Opposed the force of Agamemnon’s arm?
8939,BOOK XI.,"Iphidamas, Antenor’s valiant son,"
8940,BOOK XI.,"Of loftiest stature, who in fertile Thrace"
8941,BOOK XI.,"Mother of flocks was nourish’d, Cisseus him"
8942,BOOK XI.,"His grandsire, father of Theano praised270"
8943,BOOK XI.,"For loveliest features, in his own abode"
8944,BOOK XI.,"Rear’d yet a child, and when at length he reach’d"
8945,BOOK XI.,The measure of his glorious manhood firm
8946,BOOK XI.,"Dismiss’d him not, but, to engage him more,"
8947,BOOK XI.,"Gave him his daughter. Wedded, he his bride275"
8948,BOOK XI.,"As soon deserted, and with galleys twelve"
8949,BOOK XI.,"Following the rumor’d voyage of the Greeks,"
8950,BOOK XI.,"The same course steer’d; but at Percope moor’d,"
8951,BOOK XI.,"And marching thence, arrived on foot at Troy."
8952,BOOK XI.,He first opposed Atrides. They approach’d.280
8953,BOOK XI.,The spear of Agamemnon wander’d wide;
8954,BOOK XI.,But him Iphidamas on his broad belt
8955,BOOK XI.,"Beneath the corselet struck, and, bearing still"
8956,BOOK XI.,"On his spear-beam, enforced it; but ere yet"
8957,BOOK XI.,"He pierced the broider’d zone, his point, impress’d285"
8958,BOOK XI.,"Against the silver, turn’d, obtuse as lead."
8959,BOOK XI.,Then royal Agamemnon in his hand
8960,BOOK XI.,"The weapon grasping, with a lion’s rage"
8961,BOOK XI.,"Home drew it to himself, and from his gripe"
8962,BOOK XI.,"Wresting it, with his falchion keen his neck290"
8963,BOOK XI.,"Smote full, and stretch’d him lifeless at his foot."
8964,BOOK XI.,So slept Iphidamas among the slain;
8965,BOOK XI.,"Unhappy! from his virgin bride remote,"
8966,BOOK XI.,Associate with the men of Troy in arms
8967,BOOK XI.,"He fell, and left her beauties unenjoy’d.295"
8968,BOOK XI.,"He gave her much, gave her a hundred beeves,"
8969,BOOK XI.,And sheep and goats a thousand from his flocks
8970,BOOK XI.,"Promised, for numberless his meadows ranged;"
8971,BOOK XI.,"But Agamemnon, son of Atreus, him"
8972,BOOK XI.,"Slew and despoil’d, and through the Grecian host300"
8973,BOOK XI.,"Proceeded, laden with his gorgeous arms."
8974,BOOK XI.,"Coön that sight beheld, illustrious Chief,"
8975,BOOK XI.,"Antenor’s eldest born, but with dim eyes"
8976,BOOK XI.,Through anguish for his brother’s fall. Unseen
8977,BOOK XI.,"Of noble Agamemnon, at his side305"
8978,BOOK XI.,"He cautious stood, and with a spear his arm,"
8979,BOOK XI.,"Where thickest flesh’d, below his elbow, pierced,"
8980,BOOK XI.,Till opposite the glittering point appear’d.
8981,BOOK XI.,A thrilling horror seized the King of men
8982,BOOK XI.,"So wounded; yet though wounded so, from fight310"
8983,BOOK XI.,"He ceased not, but on Coön rush’d, his spear"
8984,BOOK XI.,"Grasping, well-thriven growth[11] of many a wind."
8985,BOOK XI.,"He by the foot drew off Iphidamas,"
8986,BOOK XI.,"His brother, son of his own sire, aloud"
8987,BOOK XI.,Calling the Trojan leaders to his aid;315
8988,BOOK XI.,When him so occupied with his keen point
8989,BOOK XI.,Atrides pierced his bossy shield beneath.
8990,BOOK XI.,Expiring on Iphidamas he fell
8991,BOOK XI.,"Prostrate, and Agamemnon lopp’d his head."
8992,BOOK XI.,"Thus, under royal Agamemnon’s hand,320"
8993,BOOK XI.,"Antenor’s sons their destiny fulfill’d,"
8994,BOOK XI.,And to the house of Ades journey’d both.
8995,BOOK XI.,"Through other ranks of warriors then he pass’d,"
8996,BOOK XI.,"Now with his spear, now with his falchion arm’d,"
8997,BOOK XI.,"And now with missile force of massy stones,325"
8998,BOOK XI.,While yet his warm blood sallied from the wound.
8999,BOOK XI.,"But when the wound grew dry, and the blood ceased,"
9000,BOOK XI.,Anguish intolerable undermined
9001,BOOK XI.,Then all the might of Atreus’ royal son.
9002,BOOK XI.,As when a laboring woman’s arrowy throes330
9003,BOOK XI.,"Seize her intense, by Juno’s daughters dread"
9004,BOOK XI.,The birth-presiding Ilithyæ deep
9005,BOOK XI.,"Infixt, dispensers of those pangs severe;"
9006,BOOK XI.,"So, anguish insupportable subdued"
9007,BOOK XI.,Then all the might of Atreus’ royal son.335
9008,BOOK XI.,"Up-springing to his seat, instant he bade"
9009,BOOK XI.,"His charioteer drive to the hollow barks,"
9010,BOOK XI.,"Heart-sick himself with pain; yet, ere he went,"
9011,BOOK XI.,With voice loud-echoing hail’d the Danaï.
9012,BOOK XI.,Friends! counsellors and leaders of the Greeks!340
9013,BOOK XI.,"Now drive, yourselves, the battle from your ships."
9014,BOOK XI.,For me the Gods permit not to employ
9015,BOOK XI.,In fight with Ilium’s host the day entire.
9016,BOOK XI.,"He ended, and the charioteer his steeds"
9017,BOOK XI.,"Lash’d to the ships; they not unwilling flew,345"
9018,BOOK XI.,Bearing from battle the afflicted King
9019,BOOK XI.,With foaming chests and bellies grey with dust.
9020,BOOK XI.,"Soon Hector, noting his retreat, aloud"
9021,BOOK XI.,Call’d on the Trojans and allies of Troy.
9022,BOOK XI.,"Trojans and Lycians, and close-fighting sons350"
9023,BOOK XI.,Of Dardanus! oh summon all your might;
9024,BOOK XI.,"Now, now be men! Their bravest is withdrawn!"
9025,BOOK XI.,Glory and honor from Saturnian Jove
9026,BOOK XI.,On me attend; now full against the Greeks
9027,BOOK XI.,"Drive all your steeds, and win a deathless name.355"
9028,BOOK XI.,He spake—and all drew courage from his word.
9029,BOOK XI.,As when his hounds bright-tooth’d some hunter cheers
9030,BOOK XI.,"Against the lion or the forest-boar,"
9031,BOOK XI.,So Priameïan Hector cheer’d his host
9032,BOOK XI.,"Magnanimous against the sons of Greece,360"
9033,BOOK XI.,Terrible as gore-tainted Mars. Among
9034,BOOK XI.,"The foremost warriors, with success elate"
9035,BOOK XI.,"He strode, and flung himself into the fight"
9036,BOOK XI.,Black as a storm which sudden from on high
9037,BOOK XI.,"Descending, furrows deep the gloomy flood.365"
9038,BOOK XI.,"Then whom slew Priameïan Hector first,"
9039,BOOK XI.,"Whom last, by Jove, that day, with glory crown’d?"
9040,BOOK XI.,"Assæus, Dolops, Orus, Agelaüs,"
9041,BOOK XI.,"Autonoüs, Hipponoüs, Æsymnus,"
9042,BOOK XI.,"Opheltius and Opites first he slew,370"
9043,BOOK XI.,"All leaders of the Greeks, and, after these,"
9044,BOOK XI.,The people. As when whirlwinds of the West
9045,BOOK XI.,"A storm encounter from the gloomy South,"
9046,BOOK XI.,"The waves roll multitudinous, and the foam"
9047,BOOK XI.,"Upswept by wandering gusts fills all the air,375"
9048,BOOK XI.,So Hector swept the Grecians. Then defeat
9049,BOOK XI.,"Past remedy and havoc had ensued,"
9050,BOOK XI.,"Then had the routed Grecians, flying, sought"
9051,BOOK XI.,"Their ships again, but that Ulysses[12] thus"
9052,BOOK XI.,Summon’d the brave Tydides to his aid.380
9053,BOOK XI.,"Whence comes it, Diomede, that we forget"
9054,BOOK XI.,"Our wonted courage? Hither, O my friend!"
9055,BOOK XI.,"And, fighting at my side, ward off the shame"
9056,BOOK XI.,"That must be ours, should Hector seize the fleet."
9057,BOOK XI.,To whom the valiant Diomede replied.385
9058,BOOK XI.,I will be firm; trust me thou shalt not find
9059,BOOK XI.,Me shrinking; yet small fruit of our attempts
9060,BOOK XI.,"Shall follow, for the Thunderer, not to us,"
9061,BOOK XI.,"But to the Trojan, gives the glorious day."
9062,BOOK XI.,"The Hero spake, and from his chariot cast390"
9063,BOOK XI.,"Thymbræus to the ground pierced through the pap,"
9064,BOOK XI.,While by Ulysses’ hand his charioteer
9065,BOOK XI.,"Godlike Molion, fell. The warfare thus"
9066,BOOK XI.,"Of both for ever closed, them there they left,"
9067,BOOK XI.,And plunging deep into the warrior-throng395
9068,BOOK XI.,Troubled the multitude. As when two boars
9069,BOOK XI.,"Turn desperate on the close-pursuing hounds,"
9070,BOOK XI.,"So they, returning on the host of Troy,"
9071,BOOK XI.,"Slew on all sides, and overtoil’d with flight"
9072,BOOK XI.,"From Hector’s arm, the Greeks meantime respired.400"
9073,BOOK XI.,"Two warriors, next, their chariot and themselves"
9074,BOOK XI.,"They took, plebeians brave, sons of the seer"
9075,BOOK XI.,Percosian Merops in prophetic skill
9076,BOOK XI.,Surpassing all; he both his sons forbad
9077,BOOK XI.,"The mortal field, but disobedient they405"
9078,BOOK XI.,"Still sought it, for their destiny prevail’d."
9079,BOOK XI.,Spear-practised Diomede of life deprived
9080,BOOK XI.,"Both these, and stripp’d them of their glorious arms,"
9081,BOOK XI.,While by Ulysses’ hand Hippodamus
9082,BOOK XI.,Died and Hypeirochus. And now the son410
9083,BOOK XI.,"Of Saturn, looking down from Ida, poised"
9084,BOOK XI.,"The doubtful war, and mutual deaths they dealt."
9085,BOOK XI.,Tydides plunged his spear into the groin
9086,BOOK XI.,"Of the illustrious son of Pæon, bold"
9087,BOOK XI.,Agastrophus. No steeds at his command415
9088,BOOK XI.,"Had he, infatuate! but his charioteer"
9089,BOOK XI.,"His steeds detain’d remote, while through the van"
9090,BOOK XI.,Himself on foot rush’d madly till he fell.
9091,BOOK XI.,But Hector through the ranks darting his eye
9092,BOOK XI.,"Perceived, and with ear-piercing cries advanced420"
9093,BOOK XI.,"Against them, follow’d by the host of Troy."
9094,BOOK XI.,"The son of Tydeus, shuddering, his approach"
9095,BOOK XI.,"Discern’d, and instant to Ulysses spake.[13]"
9096,BOOK XI.,Now comes the storm! This way the mischief rolls!
9097,BOOK XI.,Stand and repulse the Trojan. Now be firm.425
9098,BOOK XI.,"He said, and hurling his long-shadow’d beam"
9099,BOOK XI.,"Smote Hector. At his helmet’s crown he aim’d,"
9100,BOOK XI.,"Nor err’d, but brass encountering brass, the point"
9101,BOOK XI.,"Glanced wide, for he had cased his youthful brows"
9102,BOOK XI.,"In triple brass, Apollo’s glorious gift.430"
9103,BOOK XI.,Yet with rapidity at such a shock
9104,BOOK XI.,Hector recoil’d into the multitude
9105,BOOK XI.,"Afar, where sinking to his knees, he lean’d"
9106,BOOK XI.,"On his broad palm, and darkness veil’d his eyes."
9107,BOOK XI.,But while Tydides follow’d through the van435
9108,BOOK XI.,"His stormy spear, which in the distant soil"
9109,BOOK XI.,"Implanted stood, Hector his scatter’d sense"
9110,BOOK XI.,"Recovering, to his chariot sprang again,"
9111,BOOK XI.,"And, diving deep into his host, escaped."
9112,BOOK XI.,"The noble son of Tydeus, spear in hand,440"
9113,BOOK XI.,"Rush’d after him, and as he went, exclaim’d."
9114,BOOK XI.,"Dog! thou hast now escaped; but, sure the stroke"
9115,BOOK XI.,"Approach’d thee nigh, well-aim’d. Once more thy prayers"
9116,BOOK XI.,Which ever to Apollo thou prefer’st
9117,BOOK XI.,"Entering the clash of battle, have prevail’d,445"
9118,BOOK XI.,And he hath rescued thee. But well beware
9119,BOOK XI.,"Our next encounter, for if also me"
9120,BOOK XI.,"Some God befriend, thou diest. Now will I seek"
9121,BOOK XI.,"Another mark, and smite whom next I may."
9122,BOOK XI.,"He spake, and of his armor stripp’d the son450"
9123,BOOK XI.,"Spear-famed of Pæon. Meantime Paris, mate"
9124,BOOK XI.,"Of beauteous Helen, drew his bow against"
9125,BOOK XI.,Tydides; by a pillar of the tomb
9126,BOOK XI.,"Of Ilus, ancient senator revered,"
9127,BOOK XI.,"Conceal’d he stood, and while the Hero loosed455"
9128,BOOK XI.,His corselet from the breast of Pæon’s son
9129,BOOK XI.,"Renown’d, and of his helmet and his targe"
9130,BOOK XI.,"Despoil’d him; Paris, arching quick his bow,"
9131,BOOK XI.,"No devious shaft dismiss’d, but his right foot"
9132,BOOK XI.,"Pierced through the sole, and fix’d it to the ground.460"
9133,BOOK XI.,Transported from his ambush forth he leap’d
9134,BOOK XI.,"With a loud laugh, and, vaunting, thus exclaim’d:"
9135,BOOK XI.,Oh shaft well shot! it galls thee. Would to heaven
9136,BOOK XI.,"That it had pierced thy heart, and thou hadst died!"
9137,BOOK XI.,So had the Trojans respite from their toils465
9138,BOOK XI.,"Enjoy’d, who, now, shudder at sight of thee"
9139,BOOK XI.,Like she-goats when the lion is at hand.
9140,BOOK XI.,"To whom, undaunted, Diomede replied."
9141,BOOK XI.,Archer shrew-tongued! spie-maiden! man of curls![14]
9142,BOOK XI.,"Shouldst thou in arms attempt me face to face,470"
9143,BOOK XI.,Thy bow and arrows should avail thee nought.
9144,BOOK XI.,Vain boaster! thou hast scratch’d my foot—no more—
9145,BOOK XI.,And I regard it as I might the stroke
9146,BOOK XI.,Of a weak woman or a simple child.
9147,BOOK XI.,The weapons of a dastard and a slave475
9148,BOOK XI.,"Are ever such. More terrible are mine,"
9149,BOOK XI.,"And whom they pierce, though slightly pierced, he dies."
9150,BOOK XI.,"His wife her cheeks rends inconsolable,"
9151,BOOK XI.,"His babes are fatherless, his blood the glebe"
9152,BOOK XI.,"Incarnadines, and where he bleeds and rots480"
9153,BOOK XI.,More birds of prey than women haunt the place.
9154,BOOK XI.,"He ended, and Ulysses, drawing nigh,"
9155,BOOK XI.,Shelter’d Tydides; he behind the Chief
9156,BOOK XI.,"Of Ithaca sat drawing forth the shaft,"
9157,BOOK XI.,But pierced with agonizing pangs the while.485
9158,BOOK XI.,"Then, climbing to his chariot-seat, he bade"
9159,BOOK XI.,"Sthenelus hasten to the hollow ships,"
9160,BOOK XI.,Heart-sick with pain. And now alone was seen
9161,BOOK XI.,Spear-famed Ulysses; not an Argive more
9162,BOOK XI.,"Remain’d, so universal was the rout,490"
9163,BOOK XI.,"And groaning, to his own great heart he said."
9164,BOOK XI.,"Alas! what now awaits me? If, appall’d"
9165,BOOK XI.,"By multitudes, I fly, much detriment;"
9166,BOOK XI.,"And if alone they intercept me here,"
9167,BOOK XI.,"Still more; for Jove hath scatter’d all the host,495"
9168,BOOK XI.,Yet why these doubts! for know I not of old
9169,BOOK XI.,"That only dastards fly, and that the voice"
9170,BOOK XI.,"Of honor bids the famed in battle stand,"
9171,BOOK XI.,"Bleed they themselves, or cause their foes to bleed?"
9172,BOOK XI.,"While busied in such thought he stood, the ranks500"
9173,BOOK XI.,"Of Trojans fronted with broad shields, enclosed"
9174,BOOK XI.,"The hero with a ring, hemming around"
9175,BOOK XI.,"Their own destruction. As when dogs, and swains"
9176,BOOK XI.,"In prime of manhood, from all quarters rush"
9177,BOOK XI.,"Around a boar, he from his thicket bolts,505"
9178,BOOK XI.,The bright tusk whetting in his crooked jaws:
9179,BOOK XI.,"They press him on all sides, and from beneath"
9180,BOOK XI.,"Loud gnashings hear, yet firm, his threats defy;"
9181,BOOK XI.,Like them the Trojans on all sides assail’d
9182,BOOK XI.,Ulysses dear to Jove. First with his spear510
9183,BOOK XI.,"He sprang impetuous on a valiant chief,"
9184,BOOK XI.,"Whose shoulder with a downright point he pierced,"
9185,BOOK XI.,"Deïopites; Thoön next he slew,"
9186,BOOK XI.,"And Ennomus, and from his coursers’ backs"
9187,BOOK XI.,"Alighting quick, Chersidamas; beneath515"
9188,BOOK XI.,His bossy shield the gliding weapon pass’d
9189,BOOK XI.,Right through his navel; on the plain he fell
9190,BOOK XI.,"Expiring, and with both hands clench’d the dust."
9191,BOOK XI.,"Them slain he left, and Charops wounded next,"
9192,BOOK XI.,"Brother of Socus, generous Chief, and son520"
9193,BOOK XI.,Of Hippasus; brave Socus to the aid
9194,BOOK XI.,"Of Charops flew, and, godlike, thus began."
9195,BOOK XI.,"Illustrious chief, Ulysses! strong to toil"
9196,BOOK XI.,And rich in artifice! Or boast to-day
9197,BOOK XI.,"Two sons of Hippasus, brave warriors both,525"
9198,BOOK XI.,"Of armor and of life bereft by thee,"
9199,BOOK XI.,Or to my vengeful spear resign thy own!
9200,BOOK XI.,"So saying, Ulysses’ oval disk he smote."
9201,BOOK XI.,"Through his bright disk the stormy weapon flew,"
9202,BOOK XI.,"Transpierced his twisted mail, and from his side530"
9203,BOOK XI.,"Drove all the skin, but to his nobler parts"
9204,BOOK XI.,"Found entrance none, by Pallas turn’d aslant.[15]"
9205,BOOK XI.,"Ulysses, conscious of his life untouch’d,"
9206,BOOK XI.,"Retired a step from Socus, and replied."
9207,BOOK XI.,Ah hapless youth; thy fate is on the wing;535
9208,BOOK XI.,Me thou hast forced indeed to cease a while
9209,BOOK XI.,"From battle with the Trojans, but I speak"
9210,BOOK XI.,"Thy death at hand; for vanquish’d by my spear,"
9211,BOOK XI.,This self-same day thou shalt to me resign
9212,BOOK XI.,"Thy fame, thy soul to Pluto steed-renown’d.540"
9213,BOOK XI.,"He ceased; then Socus turn’d his back to fly,"
9214,BOOK XI.,"But, as he turn’d, his shoulder-blades between"
9215,BOOK XI.,"He pierced him, and the spear urged through his breast."
9216,BOOK XI.,"On his resounding arms he fell, and thus"
9217,BOOK XI.,Godlike Ulysses gloried in his fall.545
9218,BOOK XI.,"Ah, Socus, son of Hippasus, a chief"
9219,BOOK XI.,Of fame equestrian! swifter far than thou
9220,BOOK XI.,"Death follow’d thee, and thou hast not escaped."
9221,BOOK XI.,Ill-fated youth! thy parents’ hands thine eyes
9222,BOOK XI.,"Shall never close, but birds of ravenous maw550"
9223,BOOK XI.,"Shall tear thee, flapping thee with frequent wing,"
9224,BOOK XI.,While me the noble Grecians shall entomb!
9225,BOOK XI.,"So saying, the valiant Socus’ spear he drew"
9226,BOOK XI.,"From his own flesh, and through his bossy shield."
9227,BOOK XI.,"The weapon drawn, forth sprang the blood, and left555"
9228,BOOK XI.,"His spirit faint. Then Ilium’s dauntless sons,"
9229,BOOK XI.,"Seeing Ulysses’ blood, exhorted glad"
9230,BOOK XI.,"Each other, and, with force united, all"
9231,BOOK XI.,"Press’d on him. He, retiring, summon’d loud"
9232,BOOK XI.,"His followers. Thrice, loud as mortal may,560"
9233,BOOK XI.,"He call’d, and valiant Menelaus thrice"
9234,BOOK XI.,"Hearing the voice, to Ajax thus remark’d."
9235,BOOK XI.,Illustrious son of Telamon! The voice
9236,BOOK XI.,Of Laertiades comes o’er my ear
9237,BOOK XI.,"With such a sound, as if the hardy chief,565"
9238,BOOK XI.,"Abandon’d of his friends, were overpower’d"
9239,BOOK XI.,By numbers intercepting his retreat.
9240,BOOK XI.,Haste! force we quick a passage through the ranks.
9241,BOOK XI.,"His worth demands our succor, for I fear"
9242,BOOK XI.,"Lest sole conflicting with the host of Troy,570"
9243,BOOK XI.,"Brave as he is, he perish, to the loss"
9244,BOOK XI.,Unspeakable and long regret of Greece.
9245,BOOK XI.,"So saying, he went, and Ajax, godlike Chief,"
9246,BOOK XI.,"Follow’d him. At the voice arrived, they found"
9247,BOOK XI.,Ulysses Jove-beloved compass’d about575
9248,BOOK XI.,"By Trojans, as the lynxes in the hills,"
9249,BOOK XI.,"Adust for blood, compass an antler’d stag"
9250,BOOK XI.,Pierced by an archer; while his blood is warm
9251,BOOK XI.,"And his limbs pliable, from him he ’scapes;"
9252,BOOK XI.,"But when the feather’d barb hath quell’d his force,580"
9253,BOOK XI.,"In some dark hollow of the mountain’s side,"
9254,BOOK XI.,"The hungry troop devour him; chance, the while,"
9255,BOOK XI.,"Conducts a lion thither, before whom"
9256,BOOK XI.,"All vanish, and the lion feeds alone;"
9257,BOOK XI.,"So swarm’d the Trojan powers, numerous and bold,585"
9258,BOOK XI.,"Around Ulysses, who with wary skill"
9259,BOOK XI.,Heroic combated his evil day.
9260,BOOK XI.,"But Ajax came, cover’d with his broad shield"
9261,BOOK XI.,"That seem’d a tower, and at Ulysses’ side"
9262,BOOK XI.,"Stood fast; then fled the Trojans wide-dispersed,590"
9263,BOOK XI.,And Menelaus led him by the hand
9264,BOOK XI.,Till his own chariot to his aid approach’d.
9265,BOOK XI.,"But Ajax, springing on the Trojans, slew"
9266,BOOK XI.,"Doryclus, from the loins of Priam sprung,"
9267,BOOK XI.,"But spurious. Pandocus he wounded next,595"
9268,BOOK XI.,"Then wounded Pyrasus, and after him"
9269,BOOK XI.,Pylartes and Lysander. As a flood
9270,BOOK XI.,Runs headlong from the mountains to the plain
9271,BOOK XI.,After long showers from Jove; many a dry oak
9272,BOOK XI.,"And many a pine the torrent sweeps along,600"
9273,BOOK XI.,"And, turbid, shoots much soil into the sea,"
9274,BOOK XI.,"So, glorious Ajax troubled wide the field,"
9275,BOOK XI.,"Horse and man slaughtering, whereof Hector yet"
9276,BOOK XI.,Heard not; for on the left of all the war
9277,BOOK XI.,"He fought beside Scamander, where around605"
9278,BOOK XI.,"Huge Nestor, and Idomeneus the brave,"
9279,BOOK XI.,"Most deaths were dealt, and loudest roar’d the fight."
9280,BOOK XI.,"There Hector toil’d, feats wonderful of spear"
9281,BOOK XI.,"And horsemanship achieving, and the lines"
9282,BOOK XI.,Of many a phalanx desolating wide.610
9283,BOOK XI.,"Nor even then had the bold Greeks retired,"
9284,BOOK XI.,"But that an arrow triple-barb’d, dispatch’d"
9285,BOOK XI.,"By Paris, Helen’s mate, against the Chief"
9286,BOOK XI.,"Machaon warring with distinguish’d force,"
9287,BOOK XI.,"Pierced his right shoulder. For his sake alarm’d,615"
9288,BOOK XI.,"The valor-breathing Grecians fear’d, lest he"
9289,BOOK XI.,In that disast’rous field should also fall.[16]
9290,BOOK XI.,"At once, Idomeneus of Crete approach’d"
9291,BOOK XI.,"The noble Nestor, and him thus bespake."
9292,BOOK XI.,"Arise, Neleian Nestor! Pride of Greece!620"
9293,BOOK XI.,"Ascend thy chariot, and Machaon placed"
9294,BOOK XI.,"Beside thee, bear him, instant to the fleet."
9295,BOOK XI.,"For one, so skill’d in medicine, and to free"
9296,BOOK XI.,"The inherent barb, is worth a multitude."
9297,BOOK XI.,"He said, nor the Gerenian hero old625"
9298,BOOK XI.,"Aught hesitated, but into his seat"
9299,BOOK XI.,"Ascended, and Machaon, son renown’d"
9300,BOOK XI.,"Of Æsculapius, mounted at his side."
9301,BOOK XI.,"He lash’d the steeds, they not unwilling sought"
9302,BOOK XI.,"The hollow ships, long their familiar home.630"
9303,BOOK XI.,"Cebriones, meantime, the charioteer"
9304,BOOK XI.,"Of Hector, from his seat the Trojan ranks"
9305,BOOK XI.,"Observing sore discomfited, began."
9306,BOOK XI.,"Here are we busied, Hector! on the skirts"
9307,BOOK XI.,"Of roaring battle, and meantime I see635"
9308,BOOK XI.,"Our host confused, their horses and themselves"
9309,BOOK XI.,All mingled. Telamonian Ajax there
9310,BOOK XI.,Routs them; I know the hero by his shield.
9311,BOOK XI.,"Haste, drive we thither, for the carnage most"
9312,BOOK XI.,"Of horse and foot conflicting furious, there640"
9313,BOOK XI.,"Rages, and infinite the shouts arise."
9314,BOOK XI.,"He said, and with shrill-sounding scourge the steeds"
9315,BOOK XI.,"Smote ample-maned; they, at the sudden stroke"
9316,BOOK XI.,"Through both hosts whirl’d the chariot, shields and men"
9317,BOOK XI.,Trampling; with blood the axle underneath645
9318,BOOK XI.,"All redden’d, and the chariot-rings with drops"
9319,BOOK XI.,"From the horse-hoofs, and from the fellied wheels."
9320,BOOK XI.,"Full on the multitude he drove, on fire"
9321,BOOK XI.,"To burst the phalanx, and confusion sent"
9322,BOOK XI.,"Among the Greeks, for nought[17] he shunn’d the spear.650"
9323,BOOK XI.,"All quarters else with falchion or with lance,"
9324,BOOK XI.,"Or with huge stones he ranged, but cautious shunn’d"
9325,BOOK XI.,The encounter of the Telamonian Chief.
9326,BOOK XI.,But the eternal father throned on high
9327,BOOK XI.,"With fear fill’d Ajax; panic-fixt he stood,655"
9328,BOOK XI.,"His seven-fold shield behind his shoulder cast,"
9329,BOOK XI.,"And hemm’d by numbers, with an eye askant,"
9330,BOOK XI.,Watchful retreated. As a beast of prey
9331,BOOK XI.,"Retiring, turns and looks, so he his face"
9332,BOOK XI.,"Turn’d oft, retiring slow, and step by step.660"
9333,BOOK XI.,As when the watch-dogs and assembled swains
9334,BOOK XI.,"Have driven a tawny lion from the stalls,"
9335,BOOK XI.,"Then, interdicting him his wish’d repast,"
9336,BOOK XI.,"Watch all the night, he, famish’d, yet again"
9337,BOOK XI.,"Comes furious on, but speeds not, kept aloof665"
9338,BOOK XI.,"By frequent spears from daring hands, but more"
9339,BOOK XI.,"By flash of torches, which, though fierce, he dreads,"
9340,BOOK XI.,"Till, at the dawn, sullen he stalks away;"
9341,BOOK XI.,So from before the Trojans Ajax stalk’d
9342,BOOK XI.,"Sullen, and with reluctance slow retired.670"
9343,BOOK XI.,His brave heart trembling for the fleet of Greece.
9344,BOOK XI.,"As when (the boys o’erpower’d) a sluggish ass,"
9345,BOOK XI.,"On whose tough sides they have spent many a staff,"
9346,BOOK XI.,"Enters the harvest, and the spiry ears"
9347,BOOK XI.,Crops persevering; with their rods the boys675
9348,BOOK XI.,"Still ply him hard, but all their puny might"
9349,BOOK XI.,"Scarce drives him forth when he hath browsed his fill,"
9350,BOOK XI.,"So, there, the Trojans and their foreign aids"
9351,BOOK XI.,"With glittering lances keen huge Ajax urged,"
9352,BOOK XI.,"His broad shield’s centre smiting.[18] He, by turns,680"
9353,BOOK XI.,With desperate force the Trojan phalanx dense
9354,BOOK XI.,"Facing, repulsed them, and by turns he fled,"
9355,BOOK XI.,But still forbad all inroad on the fleet.
9356,BOOK XI.,"Trojans and Greeks between, alone, he stood"
9357,BOOK XI.,A bulwark. Spears from daring hands dismiss’d685
9358,BOOK XI.,"Some, piercing his broad shield, there planted stood,"
9359,BOOK XI.,"While others, in the midway falling, spent"
9360,BOOK XI.,Their disappointed rage deep in the ground.
9361,BOOK XI.,
9362,BOOK XI.,"Eurypylus, Evæmon’s noble son,"
9363,BOOK XI.,"Him seeing, thus, with weapons overwhelmed690"
9364,BOOK XI.,"Flew to his side, his glittering lance dismiss’d,"
9365,BOOK XI.,"And Apisaon, son of Phausias, struck"
9366,BOOK XI.,Under the midriff; through his liver pass’d
9367,BOOK XI.,"The ruthless point, and, falling, he expired."
9368,BOOK XI.,Forth sprang Eurypylus to seize the spoil;695
9369,BOOK XI.,Whom soon as godlike Alexander saw
9370,BOOK XI.,"Despoiling Apisaon of his arms,"
9371,BOOK XI.,"Drawing incontinent his bow, he sent"
9372,BOOK XI.,A shaft to his right thigh; the brittle reed
9373,BOOK XI.,"Snapp’d, and the rankling barb stuck fast within.700"
9374,BOOK XI.,"Terrified at the stroke, the wounded Chief"
9375,BOOK XI.,"To his own band retired, but, as he went,"
9376,BOOK XI.,With echoing voice call’d on the Danaï—
9377,BOOK XI.,"Friends! Counsellors, and leaders of the Greeks!"
9378,BOOK XI.,"Turn ye and stand, and from his dreadful lot705"
9379,BOOK XI.,"Save Ajax whelm’d with weapons; ’scape, I judge,"
9380,BOOK XI.,"He cannot from the roaring fight, yet oh"
9381,BOOK XI.,"Stand fast around him; if save ye may,"
9382,BOOK XI.,"Your champion huge, the Telamonian Chief!"
9383,BOOK XI.,So spake the wounded warrior. They at once710
9384,BOOK XI.,"With sloping bucklers, and with spears erect,"
9385,BOOK XI.,To his relief approach’d. Ajax with joy
9386,BOOK XI.,"The friendly phalanx join’d, then turn’d and stood."
9387,BOOK XI.,Thus burn’d the embattled field as with the flames
9388,BOOK XI.,Of a devouring fire. Meantime afar715
9389,BOOK XI.,From all that tumult the Neleian mares
9390,BOOK XI.,"Bore Nestor, foaming as they ran, with whom"
9391,BOOK XI.,"Machaon also rode, leader revered."
9392,BOOK XI.,Achilles mark’d him passing; for he stood
9393,BOOK XI.,"Exalted on his huge ship’s lofty stern,720"
9394,BOOK XI.,"Spectator of the toil severe, and flight"
9395,BOOK XI.,Deplorable of the defeated Greeks.
9396,BOOK XI.,He call’d his friend Patroclus. He below
9397,BOOK XI.,Within his tent the sudden summons heard
9398,BOOK XI.,"And sprang like Mars abroad, all unaware725"
9399,BOOK XI.,That in that sound he heard the voice of fate.
9400,BOOK XI.,Him first Menœtius’ gallant son address’d.
9401,BOOK XI.,What would Achilles? Wherefore hath he call’d?
9402,BOOK XI.,To whom Achilles swiftest of the swift:
9403,BOOK XI.,Brave Menœtiades! my soul’s delight!730
9404,BOOK XI.,Soon will the Grecians now my knees surround
9405,BOOK XI.,"Suppliant, by dread extremity constrain’d."
9406,BOOK XI.,"But fly Patroclus, haste, oh dear to Jove!"
9407,BOOK XI.,"Inquire of Nestor, whom he hath convey’d"
9408,BOOK XI.,"From battle, wounded? Viewing him behind,735"
9409,BOOK XI.,I most believed him Æsculapius’ son
9410,BOOK XI.,"Machaon, but the steeds so swiftly pass’d"
9411,BOOK XI.,"My galley, that his face escaped my note.[19]"
9412,BOOK XI.,"He said, and prompt to gratify his friend,"
9413,BOOK XI.,Forth ran Patroclus through the camp of Greece.740
9414,BOOK XI.,Now when Neleian Nestor to his tent
9415,BOOK XI.,"Had brought Machaon, they alighted both,"
9416,BOOK XI.,And the old hero’s friend Eurymedon
9417,BOOK XI.,Released the coursers. On the beach awhile
9418,BOOK XI.,Their tunics sweat-imbued in the cool air745
9419,BOOK XI.,"They ventilated, facing full the breeze,"
9420,BOOK XI.,Then on soft couches in the tent reposed.
9421,BOOK XI.,"Meantime, their beverage Hecamede mix’d,"
9422,BOOK XI.,"The old King’s bright-hair’d captive, whom he brought"
9423,BOOK XI.,"From Tenedos, what time Achilles sack’d750"
9424,BOOK XI.,"The city, daughter of the noble Chief"
9425,BOOK XI.,"Arsinoüs, and selected from the rest"
9426,BOOK XI.,"For Nestor, as the honorable meed"
9427,BOOK XI.,Of counsels always eminently wise.
9428,BOOK XI.,"She, first, before them placed a table bright,755"
9429,BOOK XI.,With feet cœrulean; thirst-provoking sauce
9430,BOOK XI.,"She brought them also in a brazen tray,"
9431,BOOK XI.,"Garlic[20] and honey new, and sacred meal."
9432,BOOK XI.,"Beside them, next, she placed a noble cup"
9433,BOOK XI.,"Of labor exquisite, which from his home760"
9434,BOOK XI.,The ancient King had brought with golden studs
9435,BOOK XI.,Embellish’d; it presented to the grasp
9436,BOOK XI.,"Four ears; two golden turtles, perch’d on each,"
9437,BOOK XI.,"Seem’d feeding, and two turtles[21] form’d the base."
9438,BOOK XI.,"That cup once fill’d, all others must have toil’d765"
9439,BOOK XI.,"To move it from the board, but it was light"
9440,BOOK XI.,In Nestor’s hand; he lifted it with ease.[22]
9441,BOOK XI.,The graceful virgin in that cup a draught
9442,BOOK XI.,"Mix’d for them, Pramnian wine and savory cheese"
9443,BOOK XI.,"Of goat’s milk, grated with a brazen rasp,770"
9444,BOOK XI.,"Then sprinkled all with meal. The draught prepared,"
9445,BOOK XI.,"She gave it to their hand; they, drinking, slaked"
9446,BOOK XI.,"Their fiery thirst, and with each other sat"
9447,BOOK XI.,"Conversing friendly, when the godlike youth"
9448,BOOK XI.,"By brave Achilles sent, stood at the door.775"
9449,BOOK XI.,"Him seeing, Nestor from his splendid couch"
9450,BOOK XI.,"Arose, and by the hand leading him in,"
9451,BOOK XI.,"Entreated him to sit, but that request"
9452,BOOK XI.,"Patroclus, on his part refusing, said,"
9453,BOOK XI.,Oh venerable King! no seat is here780
9454,BOOK XI.,"For me, nor may thy courtesy prevail."
9455,BOOK XI.,"He is irascible, and to be fear’d"
9456,BOOK XI.,Who bade me ask what Chieftain thou hast brought
9457,BOOK XI.,"From battle, wounded; but untold I learn;"
9458,BOOK XI.,"I see Machaon, and shall now report785"
9459,BOOK XI.,As I have seen; oh ancient King revered!
9460,BOOK XI.,"Thou know’st Achilles fiery, and propense"
9461,BOOK XI.,Blame to impute even where blame is none.
9462,BOOK XI.,
9463,BOOK XI.,To whom the brave Gerenian thus replied.
9464,BOOK XI.,Why feels Achilles for the wounded Greeks790
9465,BOOK XI.,Such deep concern? He little knows the height
9466,BOOK XI.,To which our sorrows swell. Our noblest lie
9467,BOOK XI.,By spear or arrow wounded in the fleet.
9468,BOOK XI.,"Diomede, warlike son of Tydeus, bleeds,"
9469,BOOK XI.,"Gall’d by a shaft; Ulysses, glorious Chief,795"
9470,BOOK XI.,And Agamemnon[23] suffer by the spear;
9471,BOOK XI.,"Eurypylus is shot into the thigh,"
9472,BOOK XI.,And here lies still another newly brought
9473,BOOK XI.,"By me from fight, pierced also by a shaft."
9474,BOOK XI.,"What then? How strong soe’er to give them aid,800"
9475,BOOK XI.,Achilles feels no pity of the Greeks.
9476,BOOK XI.,Waits he till every vessel on the shore
9477,BOOK XI.,"Fired, in despite of the whole Argive host,"
9478,BOOK XI.,"Be sunk in its own ashes, and ourselves"
9479,BOOK XI.,"All perish, heaps on heaps? For in my limbs805"
9480,BOOK XI.,No longer lives the agility of my youth.
9481,BOOK XI.,"Oh, for the vigor of those days again,"
9482,BOOK XI.,"When Elis, for her cattle which we took,"
9483,BOOK XI.,"Strove with us and Itymoneus I slew,"
9484,BOOK XI.,Brave offspring of Hypirochus; he dwelt810
9485,BOOK XI.,"In Elis, and while I the pledges drove,"
9486,BOOK XI.,"Stood for his herd, but fell among the first"
9487,BOOK XI.,By a spear hurl’d from my victorious arm.
9488,BOOK XI.,"Then fled the rustic multitude, and we"
9489,BOOK XI.,"Drove off abundant booty from the plain,815"
9490,BOOK XI.,"Herds fifty of fat beeves, large flocks of goats"
9491,BOOK XI.,"As many, with as many sheep and swine,"
9492,BOOK XI.,"And full thrice fifty mares of brightest hue,"
9493,BOOK XI.,"All breeders, many with their foals beneath."
9494,BOOK XI.,"All these, by night returning safe, we drove820"
9495,BOOK XI.,"Into Neleian Pylus, and the heart"
9496,BOOK XI.,"Rejoiced of Neleus, in a son so young"
9497,BOOK XI.,"A warrior, yet enrich’d with such a prize."
9498,BOOK XI.,At early dawn the heralds summon’d loud
9499,BOOK XI.,"The citizens, to prove their just demands825"
9500,BOOK XI.,"On fruitful Elis, and the assembled Chiefs"
9501,BOOK XI.,Division made (for numerous were the debts
9502,BOOK XI.,"Which the Epeans, in the weak estate"
9503,BOOK XI.,"Of the unpeopled Pylus, had incurr’d;"
9504,BOOK XI.,"For Hercules, few years before, had sack’d[24]830"
9505,BOOK XI.,"Our city, and our mightiest slain. Ourselves"
9506,BOOK XI.,"The gallant sons of Neleus, were in all"
9507,BOOK XI.,"Twelve youths, of whom myself alone survived;"
9508,BOOK XI.,"The rest all perish’d; whence, presumptuous grown,"
9509,BOOK XI.,The brazen-mail’d Epeans wrong’d us oft).835
9510,BOOK XI.,A herd of beeves my father for himself
9511,BOOK XI.,"Selected, and a numerous flock beside,"
9512,BOOK XI.,"Three hundred sheep, with shepherds for them all."
9513,BOOK XI.,For he a claimant was of large arrears
9514,BOOK XI.,From sacred Elis. Four unrivall’d steeds840
9515,BOOK XI.,"With his own chariot to the games he sent,"
9516,BOOK XI.,That should contend for the appointed prize
9517,BOOK XI.,"A tripod; but Augeias, King of men,"
9518,BOOK XI.,"Detain’d the steeds, and sent the charioteer"
9519,BOOK XI.,"Defrauded home. My father, therefore, fired845"
9520,BOOK XI.,"At such foul outrage both of deeds and words,"
9521,BOOK XI.,"Took much, and to the Pylians gave the rest"
9522,BOOK XI.,For satisfaction of the claims of all.
9523,BOOK XI.,"While thus we busied were in these concerns,"
9524,BOOK XI.,And in performance of religious rites850
9525,BOOK XI.,"Throughout the city, came the Epeans arm’d,"
9526,BOOK XI.,Their whole vast multitude both horse and foot
9527,BOOK XI.,On the third day; came also clad in brass
9528,BOOK XI.,"The two Molions, inexpert as yet"
9529,BOOK XI.,"In feats of arms, and of a boyish age.855"
9530,BOOK XI.,"There is a city on a mountain’s head,"
9531,BOOK XI.,"Fast by the banks of Alpheus, far remote,"
9532,BOOK XI.,"The utmost town which sandy Pylus owns,"
9533,BOOK XI.,"Named Thryoëssa, and, with ardor fired"
9534,BOOK XI.,"To lay it waste, that city they besieged.860"
9535,BOOK XI.,"Now when their host had traversed all the plain,"
9536,BOOK XI.,Minerva from Olympus flew by night
9537,BOOK XI.,And bade us arm; nor were the Pylians slow
9538,BOOK XI.,"To assemble, but impatient for the fight."
9539,BOOK XI.,"Me, then, my father suffer’d not to arm,865"
9540,BOOK XI.,"But hid my steeds, for he supposed me raw"
9541,BOOK XI.,"As yet, and ignorant how war is waged."
9542,BOOK XI.,"Yet, even thus, unvantaged and on foot,"
9543,BOOK XI.,Superior honors I that day acquired
9544,BOOK XI.,"To theirs who rode, for Pallas led me on870"
9545,BOOK XI.,Herself to victory. There is a stream
9546,BOOK XI.,"Which at Arena falls into the sea,"
9547,BOOK XI.,Named Minuëius; on that river’s bank
9548,BOOK XI.,"The Pylian horsemen waited day’s approach,"
9549,BOOK XI.,And thither all our foot came pouring down.875
9550,BOOK XI.,The flood divine of Alpheus thence we reach’d
9551,BOOK XI.,"At noon, all arm’d complete; there, hallow’d rites"
9552,BOOK XI.,"We held to Jove omnipotent, and slew"
9553,BOOK XI.,"A bull to sacred Alpheus, with a bull"
9554,BOOK XI.,"To Neptune, and a heifer of the herd880"
9555,BOOK XI.,"To Pallas; then, all marshall’d as they were,"
9556,BOOK XI.,"From van to rear our legions took repast,"
9557,BOOK XI.,And at the river’s side slept on their arms.
9558,BOOK XI.,Already the Epean host had round
9559,BOOK XI.,"Begirt the city, bent to lay it waste,885"
9560,BOOK XI.,"A task which cost them, first, both blood and toil,"
9561,BOOK XI.,For when the radiant sun on the green earth
9562,BOOK XI.,"Had risen, with prayer to Pallas and to Jove,"
9563,BOOK XI.,We gave them battle. When the Pylian host
9564,BOOK XI.,"And the Epeans thus were close engaged,890"
9565,BOOK XI.,"I first a warrior slew, Mulius the brave,"
9566,BOOK XI.,And seized his coursers. He the eldest-born
9567,BOOK XI.,Of King Augeias’ daughters had espoused
9568,BOOK XI.,The golden Agamede; not an herb
9569,BOOK XI.,"The spacious earth yields but she knew its powers,895"
9570,BOOK XI.,"Him, rushing on me, with my brazen lance"
9571,BOOK XI.,"I smote, and in the dust he fell; I leap’d"
9572,BOOK XI.,"Into his seat, and drove into the van."
9573,BOOK XI.,A panic seized the Epeans when they saw
9574,BOOK XI.,"The leader of their horse o’erthrown, a Chief900"
9575,BOOK XI.,Surpassing all in fight. Black as a cloud
9576,BOOK XI.,"With whirlwind fraught, I drove impetuous on,"
9577,BOOK XI.,"Took fifty chariots, and at side of each"
9578,BOOK XI.,"Lay two slain warriors, with their teeth the soil"
9579,BOOK XI.,"Grinding, all vanquish’d by my single arm.905"
9580,BOOK XI.,"I had slain also the Molions, sons"
9581,BOOK XI.,"Of Actor, but the Sovereign of the deep"
9582,BOOK XI.,"Their own authentic Sire, in darkness dense"
9583,BOOK XI.,"Involving both, convey’d them safe away."
9584,BOOK XI.,Then Jove a victory of prime renown910
9585,BOOK XI.,Gave to the Pylians; for we chased and slew
9586,BOOK XI.,And gather’d spoil o’er all the champain spread
9587,BOOK XI.,"With scatter’d shields, till we our steeds had driven"
9588,BOOK XI.,"To the Buprasian fields laden with corn,"
9589,BOOK XI.,"To the Olenian rock, and to a town915"
9590,BOOK XI.,"In fair Colona situate, and named"
9591,BOOK XI.,Alesia. There it was that Pallas turn’d
9592,BOOK XI.,Our people homeward; there I left the last
9593,BOOK XI.,"Of all the slain, and he was slain by me."
9594,BOOK XI.,Then drove the Achaians from Buprasium home920
9595,BOOK XI.,"Their coursers fleet, and Jove, of Gods above,"
9596,BOOK XI.,"Received most praise, Nestor of men below."
9597,BOOK XI.,Such once was I. But brave Achilles shuts
9598,BOOK XI.,"His virtues close, an unimparted store;"
9599,BOOK XI.,"Yet even he shall weep, when all the host,925"
9600,BOOK XI.,"His fellow-warriors once, shall be destroy’d."
9601,BOOK XI.,"But recollect, young friend! the sage advice"
9602,BOOK XI.,Which when thou earnest from Phthia to the aid
9603,BOOK XI.,"Of Agamemnon, on that selfsame day"
9604,BOOK XI.,"Menœtius gave thee. We were present there,930"
9605,BOOK XI.,"Ulysses and myself, both in the house,"
9606,BOOK XI.,And heard it all; for to the house we came
9607,BOOK XI.,Of Peleus in our journey through the land
9608,BOOK XI.,"Of fertile Greece, gathering her states to war."
9609,BOOK XI.,"We found thy noble sire Menœtius there,935"
9610,BOOK XI.,Thee and Achilles; ancient Peleus stood
9611,BOOK XI.,To Jove the Thunderer offering in his court
9612,BOOK XI.,"Thighs of an ox, and on the blazing rites"
9613,BOOK XI.,Libation pouring from a cup of gold.
9614,BOOK XI.,While ye on preparation of the feast940
9615,BOOK XI.,"Attended both, Ulysses and myself"
9616,BOOK XI.,Stood in the vestibule; Achilles flew
9617,BOOK XI.,"Toward us, introduced us by the hand,"
9618,BOOK XI.,"And, seating us, such liberal portion gave"
9619,BOOK XI.,"To each, as hospitality requires.945"
9620,BOOK XI.,"Our thirst, at length, and hunger both sufficed,"
9621,BOOK XI.,"I, foremost speaking, ask’d you to the wars,"
9622,BOOK XI.,"And ye were eager both, but from your sires"
9623,BOOK XI.,"Much admonition, ere ye went, received."
9624,BOOK XI.,Old Peleus charged Achilles to aspire950
9625,BOOK XI.,"To highest praise, and always to excel."
9626,BOOK XI.,"But thee, thy sire Menœtius thus advised."
9627,BOOK XI.,"“My son! Achilles boasts the nobler birth,"
9628,BOOK XI.,But thou art elder; he in strength excels
9629,BOOK XI.,"Thee far; thou, therefore, with discretion rule955"
9630,BOOK XI.,His inexperience; thy advice impart
9631,BOOK XI.,With gentleness; instruction wise suggest
9632,BOOK XI.,"Wisely, and thou shalt find him apt to learn.”"
9633,BOOK XI.,"So thee thy father taught, but, as it seems,"
9634,BOOK XI.,In vain. Yet even now essay to move960
9635,BOOK XI.,"Warlike Achilles; if the Gods so please,"
9636,BOOK XI.,Who knows but that thy reasons may prevail
9637,BOOK XI.,To rouse his valiant heart? men rarely scorn
9638,BOOK XI.,The earnest intercession of a friend.
9639,BOOK XI.,"But if some prophecy alarm his fears,965"
9640,BOOK XI.,And from his Goddess mother he have aught
9641,BOOK XI.,"Received, who may have learnt the same from Jove,"
9642,BOOK XI.,"Thee let him send at least, and order forth"
9643,BOOK XI.,With thee the Myrmidons; a dawn of hope
9644,BOOK XI.,"Shall thence, it may be, on our host arise.970"
9645,BOOK XI.,And let him send thee to the battle clad
9646,BOOK XI.,"In his own radiant armor; Troy, deceived"
9647,BOOK XI.,"By such resemblance, shall abstain perchance"
9648,BOOK XI.,"From conflict, and the weary Greeks enjoy"
9649,BOOK XI.,Short respite; it is all that war allows.975
9650,BOOK XI.,"Fresh as ye are, ye, by your shouts alone,"
9651,BOOK XI.,May easily repulse an army spent
9652,BOOK XI.,With labor from the camp and from the fleet.
9653,BOOK XI.,"Thus Nestor, and his mind bent to his words."
9654,BOOK XI.,Back to Æacides through all the camp980
9655,BOOK XI.,"He ran; and when, still running, he arrived"
9656,BOOK XI.,"Among Ulysses’ barks, where they had fix’d"
9657,BOOK XI.,"The forum, where they minister’d the laws,"
9658,BOOK XI.,"And had erected altars to the Gods,"
9659,BOOK XI.,"There him Eurypylus, Evæmon’s son,985"
9660,BOOK XI.,"Illustrious met, deep-wounded in his thigh,"
9661,BOOK XI.,And halting-back from battle. From his head
9662,BOOK XI.,"The sweat, and from his shoulders ran profuse,"
9663,BOOK XI.,And from his perilous wound the sable blood
9664,BOOK XI.,Continual stream’d; yet was his mind composed.990
9665,BOOK XI.,"Him seeing, Menœtiades the brave"
9666,BOOK XI.,"Compassion felt, and mournful, thus began."
9667,BOOK XI.,Ah hapless senators and Chiefs of Greece!
9668,BOOK XI.,Left ye your native country that the dogs
9669,BOOK XI.,Might fatten on your flesh at distant Troy?995
9670,BOOK XI.,"But tell me, Hero! say, Eurypylus!"
9671,BOOK XI.,Have the Achaians power still to withstand
9672,BOOK XI.,"The enormous force of Hector, or is this"
9673,BOOK XI.,The moment when his spear must pierce us all?
9674,BOOK XI.,"To whom Eurypylus, discreet, replied.1000"
9675,BOOK XI.,"Patroclus, dear to Jove! there is no help,"
9676,BOOK XI.,No remedy. We perish at our ships.
9677,BOOK XI.,"The warriors, once most strenuous of the Greeks,"
9678,BOOK XI.,Lie wounded in the fleet by foes whose might
9679,BOOK XI.,Increases ever. But thyself afford1005
9680,BOOK XI.,To me some succor; lead me to my ship;
9681,BOOK XI.,Cut forth the arrow from my thigh; the gore
9682,BOOK XI.,"With warm ablution cleanse, and on the wound"
9683,BOOK XI.,"Smooth unguents spread, the same as by report"
9684,BOOK XI.,"Achilles taught thee; taught, himself, their use1010"
9685,BOOK XI.,"By Chiron, Centaur, justest of his kind"
9686,BOOK XI.,For Podalirius and Machaon both
9687,BOOK XI.,"Are occupied. Machaon, as I judge,"
9688,BOOK XI.,"Lies wounded in his tent, needing like aid"
9689,BOOK XI.,"Himself, and Podalirius in the field1015"
9690,BOOK XI.,Maintains sharp conflict with the sons of Troy.
9691,BOOK XI.,To whom Menœtius’ gallant son replied.
9692,BOOK XI.,Hero! Eurypylus! how shall we act
9693,BOOK XI.,In this perplexity? what course pursue?
9694,BOOK XI.,"I seek the brave Achilles, to whose ear1020"
9695,BOOK XI.,I bear a message from the ancient chief
9696,BOOK XI.,"Gerenian Nestor, guardian of the Greeks."
9697,BOOK XI.,"Yet will I not, even for such a cause,"
9698,BOOK XI.,My friend! abandon thee in thy distress.
9699,BOOK XI.,"He ended, and his arms folding around1025"
9700,BOOK XI.,The warrior bore him thence into his tent.
9701,BOOK XI.,"His servant, on his entrance, spread the floor"
9702,BOOK XI.,"With hides, on which Patroclus at his length"
9703,BOOK XI.,"Extended him, and with his knife cut forth"
9704,BOOK XI.,"The rankling point; with tepid lotion, next,1030"
9705,BOOK XI.,"He cleansed the gore, and with a bitter root"
9706,BOOK XI.,"Bruised small between his palms, sprinkled the wound."
9707,BOOK XI.,"At once, the anodyne his pain assuaged,"
9708,BOOK XI.,"The wound was dried within, and the blood ceased."
9709,BOOK XI.,
9710,BOOK XI.,
9711,BOOK XI.,It will be well here to observe the position of the Greeks. All human
9712,BOOK XI.,"aid is cut off by the wounds of their heroes, and all assistance from"
9713,BOOK XI.,"the Gods forbidden by Jupiter. On the contrary, the Trojans see their"
9714,BOOK XI.,"general at their head, and Jupiter himself fights on their side. Upon"
9715,BOOK XI.,this hinge turns the whole poem. The distress of the Greeks occasions
9716,BOOK XI.,"first the assistance of Patroclus, and then the death of that hero"
9717,BOOK XI.,brings back Achilles.
9718,BOOK XI.,
9719,BOOK XI.,The poet shows great skill in conducting these incidents. He gives
9720,BOOK XI.,Achilles the pleasure of seeing that the Greeks could not carry on the
9721,BOOK XI.,"war without his assistance, and upon this depends the great catastrophe"
9722,BOOK XI.,of the poem.

9741,BOOK XII.,Nor was the foss ordain’d long time to exclude

9760,BOOK XII.,From the Idæan heights into the sea
9761,BOOK XII.,"They brought against it, gathering all their force."

9767,BOOK XII.,All these with refluent course Apollo drove30
9768,BOOK XII.,"Nine days against the rampart, and Jove rain’d"
9769,BOOK XII.,"Incessant, that the Grecian wall wave-whelm’d"
9770,BOOK XII.,Through all its length might sudden disappear.
9771,BOOK XII.,"Neptune with his tridental mace, himself,"
9772,BOOK XII.,"Led them, and beam and buttress to the flood35"
9773,BOOK XII.,"Consigning, laid by the laborious Greeks,"

9775,BOOK XII.,Of the swift-rolling Hellespont restored.
9776,BOOK XII.,"The structure thus effaced, the spacious beach"
9777,BOOK XII.,He spread with sand as at the first; then bade40
9778,BOOK XII.,"Subside the streams, and in their channels wind"
9779,BOOK XII.,"With limpid course, and pleasant as before,"
9780,BOOK XII.,"Apollo thus and Neptune, from the first,"
9781,BOOK XII.,Design’d its fall; but now the battle raved
9782,BOOK XII.,And clamors of the warriors all around45
9783,BOOK XII.,"The strong-built turrets, whose assaulted planks"
9784,BOOK XII.,"Rang, while the Grecians, by the scourge of Jove"
9785,BOOK XII.,"Subdued, stood close within their fleet immured,"
9786,BOOK XII.,At Hector’s phalanx-scattering force appall’d.
9787,BOOK XII.,"He, as before, with whirlwind fury fought.50"
9788,BOOK XII.,As when the boar or lion fiery-eyed
9789,BOOK XII.,"Turns short, the hunters and the hounds among,"
9790,BOOK XII.,"The close-embattled troop him firm oppose,"
9791,BOOK XII.,And ply him fast with spears; he no dismay
9792,BOOK XII.,"Conceives or terror in his noble heart,55"
9793,BOOK XII.,But by his courage falls; frequent he turns
9794,BOOK XII.,"Attempting bold the ranks, and where he points"
9795,BOOK XII.,"Direct his onset, there the ranks retire;"
9796,BOOK XII.,"So, through the concourse on his rolling wheels"
9797,BOOK XII.,"Borne rapid, Hector animated loud60"
9798,BOOK XII.,His fellow-warriors to surpass the trench.
9799,BOOK XII.,But not his own swift-footed steeds would dare
9800,BOOK XII.,That hazard; standing on the dangerous brink
9801,BOOK XII.,"They neigh’d aloud, for by its breadth the foss"
9802,BOOK XII.,Deterr’d them; neither was the effort slight65
9803,BOOK XII.,"To leap that gulf, nor easy the attempt"
9804,BOOK XII.,To pass it through; steep were the banks profound
9805,BOOK XII.,"On both sides, and with massy piles acute"
9806,BOOK XII.,"Thick-planted, interdicting all assault."
9807,BOOK XII.,No courser to the rapid chariot braced70
9808,BOOK XII.,Had enter’d there with ease; yet strong desires
9809,BOOK XII.,"Possess’d the infantry of that emprize,"
9810,BOOK XII.,And thus Polydamas the ear address’d
9811,BOOK XII.,"Of dauntless Hector, standing at his side."
9812,BOOK XII.,"Hector, and ye the leaders of our host,75"
9813,BOOK XII.,Both Trojans and allies! rash the attempt
9814,BOOK XII.,"I deem, and vain, to push our horses through,"
9815,BOOK XII.,So dangerous is the pass; rough is the trench
9816,BOOK XII.,"With pointed stakes, and the Achaian wall"
9817,BOOK XII.,Meets us beyond. No chariot may descend80
9818,BOOK XII.,"Or charioteer fight there; strait are the bounds,"
9819,BOOK XII.,"And incommodious, and his death were sure."
9820,BOOK XII.,"If Jove, high-thundering Ruler of the skies,"
9821,BOOK XII.,"Will succor Ilium, and nought less intend"
9822,BOOK XII.,"Than utter devastation of the Greeks,85"
9823,BOOK XII.,I am content; now perish all their host
9824,BOOK XII.,"Inglorious, from their country far remote."
9825,BOOK XII.,"But should they turn, and should ourselves be driven"
9826,BOOK XII.,Back from the fleet impeded and perplex’d
9827,BOOK XII.,"In this deep foss, I judge that not a man,90"
9828,BOOK XII.,"’Scaping the rallied Grecians, should survive"
9829,BOOK XII.,To bear the tidings of our fate to Troy.
9830,BOOK XII.,"Now, therefore, act we all as I advise."
9831,BOOK XII.,Let every charioteer his coursers hold
9832,BOOK XII.,"Fast-rein’d beside the foss, while we on foot,95"
9833,BOOK XII.,"With order undisturb’d and arms in hand,"
9834,BOOK XII.,Shall follow Hector. If destruction borne
9835,BOOK XII.,On wings of destiny this day approach
9836,BOOK XII.,"The Grecians, they will fly our first assault."
9837,BOOK XII.,"So spake Polydamas, whose safe advice100"
9838,BOOK XII.,Pleased Hector; from his chariot to the ground
9839,BOOK XII.,"All arm’d he leap’d, nor would a Trojan there"
9840,BOOK XII.,(When once they saw the Hero on his feet)
9841,BOOK XII.,"Ride into battle, but unanimous"
9842,BOOK XII.,"Descending with a leap, all trod the plain.105"
9843,BOOK XII.,Each gave command that at the trench his steeds
9844,BOOK XII.,Should stand detain’d in orderly array;
9845,BOOK XII.,"Then, suddenly, the parted host became"
9846,BOOK XII.,"Five bands, each following its appointed chief."
9847,BOOK XII.,"The bravest and most numerous, and whose hearts110"
9848,BOOK XII.,Wish’d most to burst the barrier and to wage
9849,BOOK XII.,"The battle at the ships, with Hector march’d"
9850,BOOK XII.,"And with Polydamas, whom follow’d, third,"
9851,BOOK XII.,Cebriones; for Hector had his steeds
9852,BOOK XII.,Consign’d and chariot to inferior care.115
9853,BOOK XII.,"Paris, Alcathoüs, and Agenor led"
9854,BOOK XII.,"The second band, and, sons of Priam both,"
9855,BOOK XII.,"Deïphobus and Helenus, the third;"
9856,BOOK XII.,With them was seen partner of their command;
9857,BOOK XII.,The Hero Asius; from Arisba came120
9858,BOOK XII.,"Asius Hyrtacides, to battle drawn"
9859,BOOK XII.,From the Selleïs banks by martial steeds

9865,BOOK XII.,Last came the glorious powers in league with Troy
9866,BOOK XII.,Led by Sarpedon; he with Glaucus shared
9867,BOOK XII.,"His high control, and with the warlike Chief130"
9868,BOOK XII.,Asteropæus; for of all his host
9869,BOOK XII.,"Them bravest he esteem’d, himself except"
9870,BOOK XII.,Superior in heroic might to all.
9871,BOOK XII.,And now (their shields adjusted each to each)
9872,BOOK XII.,"With dauntless courage fired, right on they moved135"
9873,BOOK XII.,Against the Grecians; nor expected less
9874,BOOK XII.,"Than that beside their sable ships, the host"

9880,BOOK XII.,"His charioteer and coursers at the trench,"
9881,BOOK XII.,"And drove toward the fleet. Ah, madly brave!"
9882,BOOK XII.,His evil hour was come; he was ordain’d145
9883,BOOK XII.,With horse and chariot and triumphant shout
9884,BOOK XII.,To enter wind-swept Ilium never more.
9885,BOOK XII.,"Deucalion’s offspring, first, into the shades"
9886,BOOK XII.,Dismiss’d him; by Idomeneus he died.
9887,BOOK XII.,"Leftward he drove furious, along the road150"
9888,BOOK XII.,By which the steeds and chariots of the Greeks
9889,BOOK XII.,"Return’d from battle; in that track he flew,"
9890,BOOK XII.,Nor found the portals by the massy bar
9891,BOOK XII.,"Secured, but open for reception safe"
9892,BOOK XII.,"Of fugitives, and to a guard consign’d.155"
9893,BOOK XII.,"Thither he drove direct, and in his rear"
9894,BOOK XII.,"His band shrill-shouting follow’d, for they judged"
9895,BOOK XII.,The Greeks no longer able to withstand
9896,BOOK XII.,"Their foes, but sure to perish in the camp."
9897,BOOK XII.,Vain hope! for in the gate two Chiefs they found160
9898,BOOK XII.,"Lapithæ-born, courageous offspring each"
9899,BOOK XII.,"Of dauntless father; Polypœtes, this,"
9900,BOOK XII.,"Sprung from Pirithöus; that, the warrior bold"
9901,BOOK XII.,"Leonteus, terrible as gore-tainted Mars."
9902,BOOK XII.,"These two, defenders of the lofty gates,165"
9903,BOOK XII.,Stood firm before them. As when two tall oaks
9904,BOOK XII.,On the high mountains day by day endure
9905,BOOK XII.,"Rough wind and rain, by deep-descending roots"
9906,BOOK XII.,Of hugest growth fast-founded in the soil;
9907,BOOK XII.,"So they, sustain’d by conscious valor, saw,170"
9908,BOOK XII.,"Unmoved, high towering Asius on his way,"
9909,BOOK XII.,"Nor fear’d him aught, nor shrank from his approach"
9910,BOOK XII.,"Right on toward the barrier, lifting high"
9911,BOOK XII.,Their season’d bucklers and with clamor loud
9912,BOOK XII.,"The band advanced, King Asius at their head,175"
9913,BOOK XII.,"With whom Iämenus, expert in arms,"
9914,BOOK XII.,"Orestes, Thöon, Acamas the son"
9915,BOOK XII.,"Of Asius, and Oenomäus, led them on."
9916,BOOK XII.,"Till now, the warlike pair, exhorting loud"
9917,BOOK XII.,"The Grecians to defend the fleet, had stood180"
9918,BOOK XII.,Within the gates; but soon as they perceived
9919,BOOK XII.,"The Trojans swift advancing to the wall,"
9920,BOOK XII.,"And heard a cry from all the flying Greeks,"
9921,BOOK XII.,"Both sallying, before the gates they fought"
9922,BOOK XII.,"Like forest-boars, which hearing in the hills185"
9923,BOOK XII.,"The crash of hounds and huntsmen nigh at hand,"
9924,BOOK XII.,With start oblique lay many a sapling flat
9925,BOOK XII.,"Short-broken by the root, nor cease to grind"
9926,BOOK XII.,"Their sounding tusks, till by the spear they die;"
9927,BOOK XII.,So sounded on the breasts of those brave two190
9928,BOOK XII.,"The smitten brass; for resolute they fought,"
9929,BOOK XII.,"Embolden’d by their might who kept the wall,"
9930,BOOK XII.,"And trusting in their own; they, in defence"
9931,BOOK XII.,"Of camp and fleet and life, thick battery hurl’d"
9932,BOOK XII.,Of stones precipitated from the towers;195
9933,BOOK XII.,"Frequent as snows they fell, which stormy winds,"
9934,BOOK XII.,"Driving the gloomy clouds, shake to the ground,"
9935,BOOK XII.,Till all the fertile earth lies cover’d deep.
9936,BOOK XII.,"Such volley pour’d the Greeks, and such return’d"
9937,BOOK XII.,"The Trojans; casques of hide, arid and tough,200"
9938,BOOK XII.,"And bossy shields rattled, by such a storm"
9939,BOOK XII.,Assail’d of millstone masses from above.
9940,BOOK XII.,"Then Asius, son of Hyrtacus, a groan"
9941,BOOK XII.,Indignant utter’d; on both thighs he smote
9942,BOOK XII.,"With disappointment furious, and exclaim’d,205"
9943,BOOK XII.,"Jupiter! even thou art false become,"
9944,BOOK XII.,And altogether such. Full sure I deem’d
9945,BOOK XII.,That not a Grecian hero should abide
9946,BOOK XII.,"One moment force invincible as ours,"
9947,BOOK XII.,"And lo! as wasps ring-streaked,[1] or bees that build210"
9948,BOOK XII.,Their dwellings in the highway’s craggy side
9949,BOOK XII.,"Leave not their hollow home, but fearless wait"
9950,BOOK XII.,"The hunter’s coming, in their brood’s defence,"
9951,BOOK XII.,"So these, although two only, from the gates"
9952,BOOK XII.,"Move not, nor will, till either seized or slain.215"
9953,BOOK XII.,"So Asius spake, but speaking so, changed not"
9954,BOOK XII.,The mind of Jove on Hector’s glory bent.
9955,BOOK XII.,"Others, as obstinate, at other gates"
9956,BOOK XII.,"Such deeds perform’d, that to enumerate all"
9957,BOOK XII.,"Were difficult, unless to power divine.220"
9958,BOOK XII.,For fierce the hail of stones from end to end
9959,BOOK XII.,Smote on the barrier; anguish fill’d the Greeks.
9960,BOOK XII.,"Yet, by necessity constrain’d, their ships"
9961,BOOK XII.,"They guarded still; nor less the Gods themselves,"
9962,BOOK XII.,"Patrons of Greece, all sorrow’d at the sight.225"
9963,BOOK XII.,At once the valiant Lapithæ began
9964,BOOK XII.,"Terrible conflict, and Pirithous’ son"
9965,BOOK XII.,Brave Polypœtes through his helmet pierced
9966,BOOK XII.,Damasus; his resplendent point the brass
9967,BOOK XII.,"Sufficed not to withstand; entering, it crush’d230"
9968,BOOK XII.,"The bone within, and mingling all his brain"
9969,BOOK XII.,"With his own blood, his onset fierce repress’d."
9970,BOOK XII.,Pylon and Ormenus he next subdued.
9971,BOOK XII.,"Meantime Leonteus, branch of Mars, his spear"
9972,BOOK XII.,"Hurl’d at Hippomachus, whom through his belt235"
9973,BOOK XII.,"He pierced; then drawing forth his falchion keen,"
9974,BOOK XII.,Through all the multitude he flew to smite
9975,BOOK XII.,"Antiphates, and with a downright stroke"
9976,BOOK XII.,Fell’d him. Iämenus and Menon next
9977,BOOK XII.,"He slew, with brave Orestes, whom he heap’d,240"
9978,BOOK XII.,"All three together, on the fertile glebe."
9979,BOOK XII.,While them the Lapithæ of their bright arms
9980,BOOK XII.,"Despoil’d, Polydamas and Hector stood"
9981,BOOK XII.,(With all the bravest youths and most resolved
9982,BOOK XII.,To burst the barrier and to fire the fleet)245
9983,BOOK XII.,"Beside the foss, pondering the event."
9984,BOOK XII.,"For, while they press’d to pass, they spied a bird"
9985,BOOK XII.,"Sublime in air, an eagle. Right between"
9986,BOOK XII.,Both hosts he soar’d (the Trojan on his left)
9987,BOOK XII.,A serpent bearing in his pounces clutch’d250
9988,BOOK XII.,"Enormous, dripping blood, but lively still"
9989,BOOK XII.,And mindful of revenge; for from beneath
9990,BOOK XII.,"The eagle’s breast, updarting fierce his head,"
9991,BOOK XII.,Fast by the throat he struck him; anguish-sick
9992,BOOK XII.,The eagle cast him down into the space255
9993,BOOK XII.,"Between the hosts, and, clanging loud his plumes"
9994,BOOK XII.,"As the wind bore him, floated far away."
9995,BOOK XII.,Shudder’d the Trojans viewing at their feet
9996,BOOK XII.,"The spotted serpent ominous, and thus"
9997,BOOK XII.,Polydamas to dauntless Hector spake.260
9998,BOOK XII.,"Ofttimes in council, Hector, thou art wont"
9999,BOOK XII.,"To censure me, although advising well;"
10000,BOOK XII.,"Nor ought the private citizen, I confess,"
10001,BOOK XII.,Either in council or in war to indulge
10002,BOOK XII.,"Loquacity, but ever to employ265"
10003,BOOK XII.,All his exertions in support of thine.
10004,BOOK XII.,Yet hear my best opinion once again.
10005,BOOK XII.,Proceed we not in our attempt against
10006,BOOK XII.,The Grecian fleet. For if in truth the sign
10007,BOOK XII.,"Respect the host of Troy ardent to pass,270"
10008,BOOK XII.,"Then, as the eagle soar’d both hosts between,"
10009,BOOK XII.,"With Ilium’s on his left, and clutch’d a snake"
10010,BOOK XII.,"Enormous, dripping blood, but still alive,"
10011,BOOK XII.,"Which yet he dropp’d suddenly, ere he reach’d"
10012,BOOK XII.,"His eyry, or could give it to his young,275"
10013,BOOK XII.,"So we, although with mighty force we burst"
10014,BOOK XII.,"Both gates and barrier, and although the Greeks"
10015,BOOK XII.,"Should all retire, shall never yet the way"
10016,BOOK XII.,Tread honorably back by which we came.
10017,BOOK XII.,No. Many a Trojan shall we leave behind280
10018,BOOK XII.,Slain by the Grecians in their fleet’s defence.
10019,BOOK XII.,An augur skill’d in omens would expound
10020,BOOK XII.,"This omen thus, and faith would win from all."
10021,BOOK XII.,"To whom, dark-louring, Hector thus replied."
10022,BOOK XII.,Polydamas! I like not thy advice;285
10023,BOOK XII.,Thou couldst have framed far better; but if this
10024,BOOK XII.,"Be thy deliberate judgment, then the Gods"
10025,BOOK XII.,"Make thy deliberate judgment nothing worth,"
10026,BOOK XII.,Who bidd’st me disregard the Thunderer’s[2] firm
10027,BOOK XII.,"Assurance to myself announced, and make290"
10028,BOOK XII.,"The wild inhabitants of air my guides,"
10029,BOOK XII.,"Which I alike despise, speed they their course"
10030,BOOK XII.,"With right-hand flight toward the ruddy East,"
10031,BOOK XII.,Or leftward down into the shades of eve.
10032,BOOK XII.,"Consider _we_ the will of Jove alone,295"
10033,BOOK XII.,"Sovereign of heaven and earth. Omens abound,"
10034,BOOK XII.,But the best omen is our country’s cause.[3]
10035,BOOK XII.,Wherefore should fiery war _thy_ soul alarm?
10036,BOOK XII.,"For were we slaughter’d, one and all, around"
10037,BOOK XII.,"The fleet of Greece, _thou_ need’st not fear to die,300"
10038,BOOK XII.,Whose courage never will thy flight retard.
10039,BOOK XII.,"But if thou shrink thyself, or by smooth speech"
10040,BOOK XII.,"Seduce one other from a soldier’s part,"
10041,BOOK XII.,Pierced by this spear incontinent thou diest.
10042,BOOK XII.,"So saying he led them, who with deafening roar305"
10043,BOOK XII.,"Follow’d him. Then, from the Idæan hills"
10044,BOOK XII.,Jove hurl’d a storm which wafted right the dust
10045,BOOK XII.,Into the fleet; the spirits too he quell’d
10046,BOOK XII.,"Of the Achaians, and the glory gave"
10047,BOOK XII.,"To Hector and his host; they, trusting firm310"
10048,BOOK XII.,"In signs from Jove, and in their proper force,"
10049,BOOK XII.,Assay’d the barrier; from the towers they tore
10050,BOOK XII.,"The galleries, cast the battlements to ground,"
10051,BOOK XII.,And the projecting buttresses adjoin’d
10052,BOOK XII.,"To strengthen the vast work, with bars upheaved.315"
10053,BOOK XII.,"All these, with expectation fierce to break"
10054,BOOK XII.,"The rampart, down they drew; nor yet the Greeks"
10055,BOOK XII.,"Gave back, but fencing close with shields the wall,"
10056,BOOK XII.,Smote from behind them many a foe beneath.
10057,BOOK XII.,Meantime from tower to tower the Ajaces moved320
10058,BOOK XII.,"Exhorting all; with mildness some, and some"
10059,BOOK XII.,"With harsh rebuke, whom they observed through fear"
10060,BOOK XII.,"Declining base the labors of the fight,"
10061,BOOK XII.,Friends! Argives! warriors of whatever rank!
10062,BOOK XII.,"Ye who excel, and ye of humbler note!325"
10063,BOOK XII.,"And ye the last and least! (for such there are,"
10064,BOOK XII.,All have not magnanimity alike)
10065,BOOK XII.,"Now have we work for all, as all perceive."
10066,BOOK XII.,"Turn not, retreat not to your ships, appall’d"
10067,BOOK XII.,"By sounding menaces, but press the foe;330"
10068,BOOK XII.,"Exhort each other, and e’en now perchance"
10069,BOOK XII.,"Olympian Jove, by whom the lightnings burn,"
10070,BOOK XII.,"Shall grant us to repulse them, and to chase"
10071,BOOK XII.,The routed Trojans to their gates again.
10072,BOOK XII.,"So they vociferating to the Greeks,335"
10073,BOOK XII.,Stirr’d them to battle. As the feathery snows
10074,BOOK XII.,"Fall frequent, on some wintry day, when Jove"
10075,BOOK XII.,"Hath risen to shed them on the race of man,"
10076,BOOK XII.,"And show his arrowy stores; he lulls the winds,"
10077,BOOK XII.,"Then shakes them down continual, covering thick340"
10078,BOOK XII.,"Mountain tops, promontories, flowery meads,"
10079,BOOK XII.,And cultured valleys rich; the ports and shores
10080,BOOK XII.,"Receive it also of the hoary deep,"
10081,BOOK XII.,"But there the waves bound it, while all beside"
10082,BOOK XII.,"Lies whelm’d beneath Jove’s fast-descending shower,345"
10083,BOOK XII.,"So thick, from side to side, by Trojans hurl’d"
10084,BOOK XII.,"Against the Greeks, and by the Greeks return’d"
10085,BOOK XII.,The stony vollies flew; resounding loud
10086,BOOK XII.,Through all its length the battered rampart roar’d.
10087,BOOK XII.,Nor yet had Hector and his host prevail’d350
10088,BOOK XII.,"To burst the gates, and break the massy bar,"
10089,BOOK XII.,Had not all-seeing Jove Sarpedon moved
10090,BOOK XII.,"His son, against the Greeks, furious as falls"
10091,BOOK XII.,The lion on some horned herd of beeves.
10092,BOOK XII.,At once his polish’d buckler he advanced355
10093,BOOK XII.,With leafy brass o’erlaid; for with smooth brass
10094,BOOK XII.,The forger of that shield its oval disk
10095,BOOK XII.,"Had plated, and with thickest hides throughout"
10096,BOOK XII.,"Had lined it, stitch’d with circling wires of gold."
10097,BOOK XII.,That shield he bore before him; firmly grasp’d360
10098,BOOK XII.,"He shook two spears, and with determined strides"
10099,BOOK XII.,"March’d forward. As the lion mountain-bred,"
10100,BOOK XII.,"After long fast, by impulse of his heart"
10101,BOOK XII.,"Undaunted urged, seeks resolute the flock"
10102,BOOK XII.,Even in the shelter of their guarded home;365
10103,BOOK XII.,"He finds, perchance, the shepherds arm’d with spears,"
10104,BOOK XII.,"And all their dogs awake, yet can not leave"
10105,BOOK XII.,"Untried the fence, but either leaps it light,"
10106,BOOK XII.,"And entering tears the prey, or in the attempt"
10107,BOOK XII.,"Pierced by some dexterous peasant, bleeds himself;370"
10108,BOOK XII.,So high his courage to the assault impell’d
10109,BOOK XII.,"Godlike Sarpedon, and him fired with hope"
10110,BOOK XII.,"To break the barrier; when to Glaucus thus,"
10111,BOOK XII.,"Son of Hippolochus, his speech he turn’d."
10112,BOOK XII.,"Why, Glaucus, is the seat of honor ours,375"
10113,BOOK XII.,"Why drink we brimming cups, and feast in state?"
10114,BOOK XII.,Why gaze they all on us as we were Gods
10115,BOOK XII.,"In Lycia, and why share we pleasant fields"
10116,BOOK XII.,"And spacious vineyards, where the Xanthus winds?"
10117,BOOK XII.,"Distinguished thus in Lycia, we are call’d380"
10118,BOOK XII.,"To firmness here, and to encounter bold"
10119,BOOK XII.,"The burning battle, that our fair report"
10120,BOOK XII.,Among the Lycians may be blazon’d thus—
10121,BOOK XII.,No dastards are the potentates who rule
10122,BOOK XII.,The bright-arm’d Lycians; on the fatted flock385
10123,BOOK XII.,"They banquet, and they drink the richest wines;"
10124,BOOK XII.,"But they are also valiant, and the fight"
10125,BOOK XII.,Wage dauntless in the vanward of us all.
10126,BOOK XII.,"Oh Glaucus, if escaping safe the death"
10127,BOOK XII.,"That threats us here, we also could escape390"
10128,BOOK XII.,"Old age, and to ourselves secure a life"
10129,BOOK XII.,"Immortal, I would neither in the van"
10130,BOOK XII.,"Myself expose, nor would encourage thee"
10131,BOOK XII.,To tempt the perils of the glorious field.
10132,BOOK XII.,But since a thousand messengers of fate395
10133,BOOK XII.,"Pursue us close, and man is born to die—"
10134,BOOK XII.,"E’en let us on; the prize of glory yield,"
10135,BOOK XII.,"If yield we must, or wrest it from the foe."
10136,BOOK XII.,"He said, nor cold refusal in return"
10137,BOOK XII.,"Received from Glaucus, but toward the wall400"
10138,BOOK XII.,Their numerous Lycian host both led direct.
10139,BOOK XII.,"Menestheus, son of Peteos, saw appall’d"
10140,BOOK XII.,"Their dread approach, for to his tower they bent;"
10141,BOOK XII.,"Their threatening march. An eager look he cast,"
10142,BOOK XII.,"On the embodied Greeks, seeking some Chief405"
10143,BOOK XII.,Whose aid might turn the battle from his van:
10144,BOOK XII.,"He saw, where never sated with exploits"
10145,BOOK XII.,"Of war, each Ajax fought, near whom his eye"
10146,BOOK XII.,"Kenn’d Teucer also, newly from his tent;"
10147,BOOK XII.,But vain his efforts were with loudest call410
10148,BOOK XII.,"To reach their ears, such was the deafening din"
10149,BOOK XII.,"Upsent to heaven, of shields and crested helms,"
10150,BOOK XII.,And of the batter’d gates; for at each gate
10151,BOOK XII.,"They thundering stood, and urged alike at each"
10152,BOOK XII.,Their fierce attempt by force to burst the bars.415
10153,BOOK XII.,To Ajax therefore he at once dispatch’d
10154,BOOK XII.,"A herald, and Thöotes thus enjoin’d."
10155,BOOK XII.,"My noble friend, Thöotes! with all speed"
10156,BOOK XII.,Call either Ajax; bid them hither both;
10157,BOOK XII.,Far better so; for havoc is at hand.420
10158,BOOK XII.,"The Lycian leaders, ever in assault"
10159,BOOK XII.,"Tempestuous, bend their force against this tower"
10160,BOOK XII.,My station. But if also there they find
10161,BOOK XII.,"Laborious conflict pressing them severe,"
10162,BOOK XII.,"At least let Telamonian Ajax come,425"
10163,BOOK XII.,And Teucer with his death-dispensing bow.
10164,BOOK XII.,"He spake, nor was Thöotes slow to hear;"
10165,BOOK XII.,Beside the rampart of the mail-clad Greeks
10166,BOOK XII.,"Rapid he flew, and, at their side arrived,"
10167,BOOK XII.,"To either Ajax, eager, thus began.430"
10168,BOOK XII.,"Ye leaders of the well-appointed Greeks,"
10169,BOOK XII.,The son of noble Peteos calls; he begs
10170,BOOK XII.,"With instant suit, that ye would share his toils,"
10171,BOOK XII.,However short your stay; the aid of both
10172,BOOK XII.,"Will serve him best, for havoc threatens there435"
10173,BOOK XII.,"The Lycian leaders, ever in assault"
10174,BOOK XII.,"Tempestuous, bend their force toward the tower"
10175,BOOK XII.,His station. But if also here ye find
10176,BOOK XII.,"Laborious conflict pressing you severe,"
10177,BOOK XII.,"At least let Telamonian Ajax come,440"
10178,BOOK XII.,And Teucer with his death-dispensing bow.
10179,BOOK XII.,"He spake, nor his request the towering son"
10180,BOOK XII.,"Of Telamon denied, but quick his speech"
10181,BOOK XII.,To Ajax Oïliades address’d.
10182,BOOK XII.,"Ajax! abiding here, exhort ye both445"
10183,BOOK XII.,(Heroic Lycomedes and thyself)
10184,BOOK XII.,The Greeks to battle. Thither I depart
10185,BOOK XII.,"To aid our friends, which service once perform’d"
10186,BOOK XII.,"Duly, I will incontinent return."
10187,BOOK XII.,"So saying, the Telamonian Chief withdrew450"
10188,BOOK XII.,"With whom went Teucer, son of the same sire,"
10189,BOOK XII.,"Pandion also, bearing Teucer’s bow."
10190,BOOK XII.,Arriving at the turret given in charge
10191,BOOK XII.,"To the bold Chief Menestheus, and the wall"
10192,BOOK XII.,"Entering, they found their friends all sharply tried.455"
10193,BOOK XII.,Black as a storm the senators renown’d
10194,BOOK XII.,And leaders of the Lycian host assail’d
10195,BOOK XII.,"Buttress and tower, while opposite the Greeks"
10196,BOOK XII.,"Withstood them, and the battle-shout began."
10197,BOOK XII.,"First, Ajax, son of Telamon, a friend460"
10198,BOOK XII.,"And fellow-warrior of Sarpedon slew,"
10199,BOOK XII.,Epicles. With a marble fragment huge
10200,BOOK XII.,"That crown’d the battlement’s interior side,"
10201,BOOK XII.,"He smote him. No man of our puny race,"
10202,BOOK XII.,"Although in prime of youth, had with both hands465"
10203,BOOK XII.,That weight sustain’d; but he the cumberous mass
10204,BOOK XII.,"Uplifted high, and hurl’d it on his head."
10205,BOOK XII.,"It burst his helmet, and his batter’d skull"
10206,BOOK XII.,Dash’d from all form. He from the lofty tower
10207,BOOK XII.,"Dropp’d downright, with a diver’s plunge, and died.470"
10208,BOOK XII.,But Teucer wounded Glaucus with a shaft
10209,BOOK XII.,"Son of Hippolochus; he, climbing, bared"
10210,BOOK XII.,"His arm, which Teucer, marking, from the wall"
10211,BOOK XII.,"Transfix’d it, and his onset fierce repress’d;"
10212,BOOK XII.,For with a backward leap Glaucus withdrew475
10213,BOOK XII.,"Sudden and silent, cautious lest the Greeks"
10214,BOOK XII.,Seeing him wounded should insult his pain.
10215,BOOK XII.,"Grief seized, at sight of his retiring friend,"
10216,BOOK XII.,"Sarpedon, who forgat not yet the fight,"
10217,BOOK XII.,"But piercing with his lance Alcmaon, son480"
10218,BOOK XII.,"Of Thestor, suddenly reversed the beam,"
10219,BOOK XII.,"Which following, Alcmaon to the earth"
10220,BOOK XII.,"Fell prone, with clangor of his brazen arms."
10221,BOOK XII.,"Sarpedon, then, strenuous with both hands"
10222,BOOK XII.,"Tugg’d, and down fell the battlement entire;485"
10223,BOOK XII.,"The wall, dismantled at the summit, stood"
10224,BOOK XII.,"A ruin, and wide chasm was open’d through."
10225,BOOK XII.,Then Ajax him and Teucer at one time
10226,BOOK XII.,Struck both; an arrow struck from Teucer’s bow
10227,BOOK XII.,"The belt that cross’d his bosom, by which hung490"
10228,BOOK XII.,His ample shield; yet lest his son should fall
10229,BOOK XII.,"Among the ships, Jove turn’d the death aside."
10230,BOOK XII.,"But Ajax, springing to his thrust, a spear"
10231,BOOK XII.,Drove through his shield. Sarpedon at the shock
10232,BOOK XII.,"With backward step short interval recoil’d,495"
10233,BOOK XII.,"But not retired, for in his bosom lived"
10234,BOOK XII.,"The hope of glory still, and, looking back"
10235,BOOK XII.,"On all his godlike Lycians, he exclaim’d,"
10236,BOOK XII.,Oh Lycians! where is your heroic might?
10237,BOOK XII.,"Brave as I boast myself, I feel the task500"
10238,BOOK XII.,"Arduous, through the breach made by myself"
10239,BOOK XII.,"To win a passage to the ships, alone."
10240,BOOK XII.,"Follow me all—Most laborers, most dispatch.[4]"
10241,BOOK XII.,So he; at whose sharp reprimand abash’d
10242,BOOK XII.,"The embattled host to closer conflict moved,505"
10243,BOOK XII.,Obedient to their counsellor and King.
10244,BOOK XII.,On the other side the Greeks within the wall
10245,BOOK XII.,"Made firm the phalanx, seeing urgent need;"
10246,BOOK XII.,Nor could the valiant Lycians through the breach
10247,BOOK XII.,"Admittance to the Grecian fleet obtain,510"
10248,BOOK XII.,"Nor since they first approach’d it, had the Greeks"
10249,BOOK XII.,"With all their efforts, thrust the Lycians back."
10250,BOOK XII.,"But as two claimants of one common field,"
10251,BOOK XII.,"Each with his rod of measurement in hand,"
10252,BOOK XII.,"Dispute the boundaries, litigating warm515"
10253,BOOK XII.,"Their right in some small portion of the soil,"
10254,BOOK XII.,"So they, divided by the barrier, struck"
10255,BOOK XII.,"With hostile rage the bull-hide bucklers round,"
10256,BOOK XII.,And the light targets on each other’s breast.
10257,BOOK XII.,Then many a wound the ruthless weapons made.520
10258,BOOK XII.,"Pierced through the unarm’d back, if any turn’d,"
10259,BOOK XII.,"He died, and numerous even through the shield."
10260,BOOK XII.,The battlements from end to end with blood
10261,BOOK XII.,Of Grecians and of Trojans on both sides
10262,BOOK XII.,Were sprinkled; yet no violence could move525
10263,BOOK XII.,"The stubborn Greeks, or turn their powers to flight."
10264,BOOK XII.,"So hung the war in balance, as the scales"
10265,BOOK XII.,"Held by some woman scrupulously just,"
10266,BOOK XII.,"A spinner; wool and weight she poises nice,"
10267,BOOK XII.,"Hard-earning slender pittance for her babes,[5]530"
10268,BOOK XII.,Such was the poise in which the battle hung
10269,BOOK XII.,"Till Jove himself superior fame, at length,"
10270,BOOK XII.,"To Priamëian Hector gave, who sprang"
10271,BOOK XII.,First through the wall. In lofty sounds that reach’d
10272,BOOK XII.,"Their utmost ranks, he call’d on all his host.535"
10273,BOOK XII.,"Now press them, now ye Trojans steed-renown’d"
10274,BOOK XII.,"Rush on! break through the Grecian rampart, hurl"
10275,BOOK XII.,At once devouring flames into the fleet.
10276,BOOK XII.,Such was his exhortation; they his voice
10277,BOOK XII.,"All hearing, with close-order’d ranks direct540"
10278,BOOK XII.,"Bore on the barrier, and up-swarming show’d"
10279,BOOK XII.,On the high battlement their glittering spears.
10280,BOOK XII.,But Hector seized a stone; of ample base
10281,BOOK XII.,"But tapering to a point, before the gate"
10282,BOOK XII.,"It stood. No two men, mightiest of a land545"
10283,BOOK XII.,(Such men as now are mighty) could with ease
10284,BOOK XII.,Have heaved it from the earth up to a wain;
10285,BOOK XII.,He swung it easily alone; so light
10286,BOOK XII.,The son of Saturn made it in his hand.
10287,BOOK XII.,As in one hand with ease the shepherd bears550
10288,BOOK XII.,"A ram’s fleece home, nor toils beneath the weight,"
10289,BOOK XII.,"So Hector, right toward the planks of those"
10290,BOOK XII.,"Majestic folding-gates, close-jointed, firm"
10291,BOOK XII.,"And solid, bore the stone. Two bars within"
10292,BOOK XII.,Their corresponding force combined transvere555
10293,BOOK XII.,"To guard them, and one bolt secured the bars."
10294,BOOK XII.,"He stood fast by them, parting wide his feet"
10295,BOOK XII.,"For ’vantage sake, and smote them in the midst."
10296,BOOK XII.,He burst both hinges; inward fell the rock
10297,BOOK XII.,"Ponderous, and the portals roar’d; the bars560"
10298,BOOK XII.,"Endured not, and the planks, riven by the force"
10299,BOOK XII.,"Of that huge mass, flew scatter’d on all sides."
10300,BOOK XII.,"In leap’d the godlike Hero at the breach,"
10301,BOOK XII.,"Gloomy as night in aspect, but in arms"
10302,BOOK XII.,"All-dazzling, and he grasp’d two quivering spears.565"
10303,BOOK XII.,"Him entering with a leap the gates, no force"
10304,BOOK XII.,"Whate’er of opposition had repress’d,"
10305,BOOK XII.,Save of the Gods alone. Fire fill’d his eyes;
10306,BOOK XII.,"Turning, he bade the multitude without"
10307,BOOK XII.,Ascend the rampart; they his voice obey’d;570
10308,BOOK XII.,"Part climb’d the wall, part pour’d into the gate;"
10309,BOOK XII.,The Grecians to their hollow galleys flew
10310,BOOK XII.,"Scatter’d, and tumult infinite arose.[6]"

10350,BOOK XIII.,"Nor Neptune, sovereign of the boundless Deep,"
10351,BOOK XIII.,Look’d forth in vain; he on the summit sat15

10362,BOOK XIII.,Trembled of Ocean’s Sovereign as he strode.
10363,BOOK XIII.,"Three strides he made, the fourth convey’d him home"
10364,BOOK XIII.,"To Ægæ. At the bottom of the abyss,"
10365,BOOK XIII.,"There stands magnificent his golden fane,"
10366,BOOK XIII.,"A dazzling, incorruptible abode.30"
10367,BOOK XIII.,"Arrived, he to his chariot join’d his steeds"
10368,BOOK XIII.,"Swift, brazen-hoof’d, and maned with wavy gold;"
10369,BOOK XIII.,"Himself attiring next in gold, he seized"
10370,BOOK XIII.,"His golden scourge, and to his seat sublime"
10371,BOOK XIII.,"Ascending, o’er the billows drove; the whales35"
10372,BOOK XIII.,"Leaving their caverns, gambol’d on all sides"
10373,BOOK XIII.,"Around him, not unconscious of their King;"
10374,BOOK XIII.,He swept the surge that tinged not as he pass’d
10375,BOOK XIII.,"His axle, and the sea parted for joy."
10376,BOOK XIII.,His bounding coursers to the Grecian fleet40
10377,BOOK XIII.,Convey’d him swift. There is a spacious cave
10378,BOOK XIII.,"Deep in the bottom of the flood, the rocks"
10379,BOOK XIII.,Of Imbrus rude and Tenedos between;
10380,BOOK XIII.,"There Neptune, Shaker of the Shores, his steeds"
10381,BOOK XIII.,"Station’d secure; he loosed them from the yoke,45"
10382,BOOK XIII.,"Gave them ambrosial food, and bound their feet"
10383,BOOK XIII.,With golden tethers not to be untied
10384,BOOK XIII.,"Or broken, that unwandering they might wait"
10385,BOOK XIII.,"Their Lord’s return, then sought the Grecian host."
10386,BOOK XIII.,"The Trojans, tempest-like or like a flame,50"
10387,BOOK XIII.,"Now, following Priameïan Hector, all"
10388,BOOK XIII.,Came furious on and shouting to the skies.
10389,BOOK XIII.,"Their hope was to possess the fleet, and leave"
10390,BOOK XIII.,Not an Achaian of the host unslain.
10391,BOOK XIII.,But earth-encircler Neptune from the gulf55
10392,BOOK XIII.,"Emerging, in the form and with the voice"
10393,BOOK XIII.,"Loud-toned of Calchas, roused the Argive ranks"
10394,BOOK XIII.,To battle—and his exhortation first
10395,BOOK XIII.,"To either Ajax turn’d, themselves prepared."
10396,BOOK XIII.,Ye heroes Ajax! your accustomed force60
10397,BOOK XIII.,"Exert, oh! think not of disastrous flight,"
10398,BOOK XIII.,And ye shall save the people. Nought I fear
10399,BOOK XIII.,"Fatal elsewhere, although Troy’s haughty sons"
10400,BOOK XIII.,Have pass’d the barrier with so fierce a throng
10401,BOOK XIII.,Tumultuous; for the Grecians brazen-greaved65
10402,BOOK XIII.,Will check them there. Here only I expect
10403,BOOK XIII.,"And with much dread some dire event forebode,"
10404,BOOK XIII.,"Where Hector, terrible as fire, and loud"
10405,BOOK XIII.,"Vaunting his glorious origin from Jove,"
10406,BOOK XIII.,Leads on the Trojans. Oh that from on high70
10407,BOOK XIII.,Some God would form the purpose in your hearts
10408,BOOK XIII.,"To stand yourselves firmly, and to exhort"
10409,BOOK XIII.,The rest to stand! so should ye chase him hence
10410,BOOK XIII.,"All ardent as he is, and even although"
10411,BOOK XIII.,Olympian Jove himself his rage inspire.75
10412,BOOK XIII.,"So Neptune spake, compasser of the earth,"
10413,BOOK XIII.,"And, with his sceptre smiting both, their hearts"
10414,BOOK XIII.,Fill’d with fresh fortitude; their limbs the touch
10415,BOOK XIII.,"Made agile, wing’d their feet and nerved their arms."
10416,BOOK XIII.,"Then, swift as stoops a falcon from the point80"
10417,BOOK XIII.,"Of some rude rock sublime, when he would chase"
10418,BOOK XIII.,"A fowl of other wing along the meads,"
10419,BOOK XIII.,"So started Neptune thence, and disappear’d."
10420,BOOK XIII.,"Him, as he went, swift Oïliades"
10421,BOOK XIII.,"First recognized, and, instant, thus his speech85"
10422,BOOK XIII.,"To Ajax, son of Telamon, address’d."
10423,BOOK XIII.,"Since, Ajax, some inhabitant of heaven"
10424,BOOK XIII.,"Exhorts us, in the prophet’s form to fight"
10425,BOOK XIII.,(For prophet none or augur we have seen;
10426,BOOK XIII.,This was not Calchas; as he went I mark’d90
10427,BOOK XIII.,His steps and knew him; Gods are known with ease)
10428,BOOK XIII.,I feel my spirit in my bosom fired
10429,BOOK XIII.,"Afresh for battle; lightness in my limbs,"
10430,BOOK XIII.,In hands and feet a glow unfelt before.
10431,BOOK XIII.,To whom the son of Telamon replied.95
10432,BOOK XIII.,I also with invigorated hands
10433,BOOK XIII.,"More firmly grasp my spear; my courage mounts,"
10434,BOOK XIII.,A buoyant animation in my feet
10435,BOOK XIII.,"Bears me along, and I am all on fire"
10436,BOOK XIII.,"To cope with Priam’s furious son, alone.100"
10437,BOOK XIII.,"Thus they, with martial transport to their souls"
10438,BOOK XIII.,"Imparted by the God, conferr’d elate."
10439,BOOK XIII.,"Meantime the King of Ocean roused the Greeks,"
10440,BOOK XIII.,"Who in the rear, beside their gallant barks"
10441,BOOK XIII.,"Some respite sought. They, spent with arduous toil,105"
10442,BOOK XIII.,Felt not alone their weary limbs unapt
10443,BOOK XIII.,"To battle, but their hearts with grief oppress’d,"
10444,BOOK XIII.,Seeing the numerous multitude of Troy
10445,BOOK XIII.,Within the mighty barrier; sad they view’d
10446,BOOK XIII.,"That sight, and bathed their cheeks with many a tear,110"
10447,BOOK XIII.,Despairing of escape. But Ocean’s Lord
10448,BOOK XIII.,"Entering among them, soon the spirit stirr’d"
10449,BOOK XIII.,Of every valiant phalanx to the fight.
10450,BOOK XIII.,"Teucer and Leïtus, and famed in arms"
10451,BOOK XIII.,"Peneleus, Thoas and Deipyrus,115"
10452,BOOK XIII.,"Meriones, and his compeer renown’d,"
10453,BOOK XIII.,Antilochus; all these in accents wing’d
10454,BOOK XIII.,With fierce alacrity the God address’d.
10455,BOOK XIII.,"Oh shame, ye Grecians! vigorous as ye are"
10456,BOOK XIII.,"And in life’s prime, to your exertions most120"
10457,BOOK XIII.,I trusted for the safety of our ships.
10458,BOOK XIII.,"If _ye_ renounce the labors of the field,"
10459,BOOK XIII.,Then hath the day arisen of our defeat
10460,BOOK XIII.,And final ruin by the powers of Troy.
10461,BOOK XIII.,"Oh! I behold a prodigy, a sight125"
10462,BOOK XIII.,"Tremendous, deem’d impossible by me,"
10463,BOOK XIII.,The Trojans at our ships! the dastard race
10464,BOOK XIII.,Fled once like fleetest hinds the destined prey
10465,BOOK XIII.,"Of lynxes, leopards, wolves; feeble and slight"
10466,BOOK XIII.,And of a nature indisposed to war130
10467,BOOK XIII.,They rove uncertain; so the Trojans erst
10468,BOOK XIII.,"Stood not, nor to Achaian prowess dared"
10469,BOOK XIII.,The hindrance of a moment’s strife oppose.
10470,BOOK XIII.,"But now, Troy left afar, even at our ships"
10471,BOOK XIII.,"They give us battle, through our leader’s fault135"
10472,BOOK XIII.,"And through the people’s negligence, who fill’d"
10473,BOOK XIII.,"With fierce displeasure against _him_, prefer"
10474,BOOK XIII.,"Death at their ships, to war in their defence."
10475,BOOK XIII.,"But if the son of Atreus, our supreme,"
10476,BOOK XIII.,"If Agamemnon, have indeed transgress’d140"
10477,BOOK XIII.,"Past all excuse, dishonoring the swift"
10478,BOOK XIII.,"Achilles, ye at least the fight decline"
10479,BOOK XIII.,"Blame-worthy, and with no sufficient plea."
10480,BOOK XIII.,But heal we speedily the breach; brave minds
10481,BOOK XIII.,Easily coalesce. It is not well145
10482,BOOK XIII.,"That thus your fury slumbers, for the host"
10483,BOOK XIII.,Hath none illustrious as yourselves in arms.
10484,BOOK XIII.,"I can excuse the timid if he shrink,"
10485,BOOK XIII.,"But am incensed at _you_. My friends, beware!"
10486,BOOK XIII.,Your tardiness will prove ere long the cause150
10487,BOOK XIII.,Of some worse evil. Let the dread of shame
10488,BOOK XIII.,Affect your hearts; oh tremble at the thought
10489,BOOK XIII.,Of infamy! Fierce conflict hath arisen;
10490,BOOK XIII.,Loud shouting Hector combats at the ships
10491,BOOK XIII.,"Nobly, hath forced the gates and burst the bar.155"
10492,BOOK XIII.,With such encouragement those Grecian chiefs
10493,BOOK XIII.,"The King of Ocean roused. Then, circled soon"
10494,BOOK XIII.,"By many a phalanx either Ajax stood,"
10495,BOOK XIII.,Whose order Mars himself arriving there
10496,BOOK XIII.,"Had praised, or Pallas, patroness of arms.160"
10497,BOOK XIII.,For there the flower of all expected firm
10498,BOOK XIII.,"Bold Hector and his host; spear crowded spear,"
10499,BOOK XIII.,"Shield, helmet, man, press’d helmet, man and shield;[3]"
10500,BOOK XIII.,The hairy crests of their resplendent casques
10501,BOOK XIII.,"Kiss’d close at every nod, so wedged they stood;165"
10502,BOOK XIII.,No spear was seen but in the manly grasp
10503,BOOK XIII.,"It quiver’d, and their every wish was war."
10504,BOOK XIII.,The powers of Ilium gave the first assault
10505,BOOK XIII.,Embattled close; them Hector led himself[4]
10506,BOOK XIII.,"Right on, impetuous as a rolling rock170"
10507,BOOK XIII.,Destructive; torn by torrent waters off
10508,BOOK XIII.,"From its old lodgment on the mountain’s brow,"
10509,BOOK XIII.,"It bounds, it shoots away; the crashing wood"
10510,BOOK XIII.,Falls under it; impediment or check
10511,BOOK XIII.,"None stays its fury, till the level found,175"
10512,BOOK XIII.,"There, settling by degrees, it rolls no more;"
10513,BOOK XIII.,So after many a threat that he would pass
10514,BOOK XIII.,Easily through the Grecian camp and fleet
10515,BOOK XIII.,"And slay to the sea-brink, when Hector once"
10516,BOOK XIII.,"Had fallen on those firm ranks, standing, he bore180"
10517,BOOK XIII.,Vehement on them; but by many a spear
10518,BOOK XIII.,"Urged and bright falchion, soon, reeling, retired,"
10519,BOOK XIII.,And call’d vociferous on the host of Troy.
10520,BOOK XIII.,"Trojans, and Lycians, and close-fighting sons"
10521,BOOK XIII.,"Of Dardanus, oh stand! not long the Greeks185"
10522,BOOK XIII.,"Will me confront, although embodied close"
10523,BOOK XIII.,In solid phalanx; doubt it not; my spear
10524,BOOK XIII.,"Shall chase and scatter them, if Jove, in truth,"
10525,BOOK XIII.,"High-thundering mate of Juno, bid me on."
10526,BOOK XIII.,So saying he roused the courage of them all190
10527,BOOK XIII.,"Foremost of whom advanced, of Priam’s race"
10528,BOOK XIII.,"Deiphobus, ambitious of renown."
10529,BOOK XIII.,"Tripping he came with shorten’d steps,[5] his feet"
10530,BOOK XIII.,Sheltering behind his buckler; but at him
10531,BOOK XIII.,"Aiming, Meriones his splendid lance195"
10532,BOOK XIII.,"Dismiss’d, nor err’d; his bull-hide targe he struck"
10533,BOOK XIII.,But ineffectual; where the hollow wood
10534,BOOK XIII.,"Receives the inserted brass, the quivering beam"
10535,BOOK XIII.,"Snapp’d; then, Deiphobus his shield afar"
10536,BOOK XIII.,"Advanced before him, trembling at a spear200"
10537,BOOK XIII.,"Hurl’d by Meriones. He, moved alike"
10538,BOOK XIII.,With indignation for the victory lost
10539,BOOK XIII.,"And for his broken spear, into his band"
10540,BOOK XIII.,"At first retired, but soon set forth again"
10541,BOOK XIII.,"In prowess through the Achaian camp, to fetch205"
10542,BOOK XIII.,Its fellow-spear within his tent reserved.
10543,BOOK XIII.,"The rest all fought, and dread the shouts arose"
10544,BOOK XIII.,"On all sides. Telamonian Teucer, first,"
10545,BOOK XIII.,"Slew valiant Imbrius, son of Mentor, rich"
10546,BOOK XIII.,In herds of sprightly steeds. He ere the Greeks210
10547,BOOK XIII.,"Arrived at Ilium, in Pedæus dwelt,"
10548,BOOK XIII.,And Priam’s spurious daughter had espoused
10549,BOOK XIII.,Medesicasta. But the barks well-oar’d
10550,BOOK XIII.,"Of Greece arriving, he return’d to Troy,"
10551,BOOK XIII.,"Where he excell’d the noblest, and abode215"
10552,BOOK XIII.,"With Priam, loved and honor’d as his own."
10553,BOOK XIII.,"Him Teucer pierced beneath his ear, and pluck’d"
10554,BOOK XIII.,His weapon home; he fell as falls an ash
10555,BOOK XIII.,"Which on some mountain visible afar,"
10556,BOOK XIII.,"Hewn from its bottom by the woodman’s axe,220"
10557,BOOK XIII.,With all its tender foliage meets the ground
10558,BOOK XIII.,So Imbrius fell; loud rang his armor bright
10559,BOOK XIII.,"With ornamental brass, and Teucer flew"
10560,BOOK XIII.,"To seize his arms, whom hasting to the spoil"
10561,BOOK XIII.,Hector with his resplendent spear assail’d;225
10562,BOOK XIII.,"He, marking opposite its rapid flight,"
10563,BOOK XIII.,"Declined it narrowly and it pierced the breast,"
10564,BOOK XIII.,"As he advanced to battle, of the son"
10565,BOOK XIII.,"Of Cteatus of the Actorian race,"
10566,BOOK XIII.,"Amphimachus; he, sounding, smote the plain,230"
10567,BOOK XIII.,And all his batter’d armor rang aloud.
10568,BOOK XIII.,"Then Hector swift approaching, would have torn"
10569,BOOK XIII.,The well-forged helmet from the brows away
10570,BOOK XIII.,Of brave Amphimachus; but Ajax hurl’d
10571,BOOK XIII.,Right forth at Hector hasting to the spoil235
10572,BOOK XIII.,"His radiant spear; no wound the spear impress’d,"
10573,BOOK XIII.,For he was arm’d complete in burnish’d brass
10574,BOOK XIII.,Terrific; but the solid boss it pierced
10575,BOOK XIII.,"Of Hector’s shield, and with enormous force"
10576,BOOK XIII.,"So shock’d him, that retiring he resign’d240"
10577,BOOK XIII.,"Both bodies,[6] which the Grecians dragg’d away."
10578,BOOK XIII.,"Stichius and Menestheus, leaders both"
10579,BOOK XIII.,"Of the Athenians, to the host of Greece"
10580,BOOK XIII.,"Bore off Amphimachus, and, fierce in arms"
10581,BOOK XIII.,"The Ajaces, Imbrius. As two lions bear245"
10582,BOOK XIII.,Through thick entanglement of boughs and brakes
10583,BOOK XIII.,"A goat snatch’d newly from the peasants’ cogs,"
10584,BOOK XIII.,"Upholding high their prey above the ground,"
10585,BOOK XIII.,"So either Ajax terrible in fight,"
10586,BOOK XIII.,"Upholding Imbrius high, his brazen arms250"
10587,BOOK XIII.,"Tore off, and Oïliades his head"
10588,BOOK XIII.,From his smooth neck dissevering in revenge
10589,BOOK XIII.,"For slain Amphimachus, through all the host"
10590,BOOK XIII.,"Sent it with swift rotation like a globe,"
10591,BOOK XIII.,Till in the dust at Hector’s feet it fell.255
10592,BOOK XIII.,"Then anger fill’d the heart of Ocean’s King,"
10593,BOOK XIII.,His grandson[7] slain in battle; forth he pass’d
10594,BOOK XIII.,"Through the Achaian camp and fleet, the Greeks"
10595,BOOK XIII.,"Rousing, and meditating wo to Troy."
10596,BOOK XIII.,It chanced that brave Idomeneus return’d260
10597,BOOK XIII.,That moment from a Cretan at the knee
10598,BOOK XIII.,"Wounded, and newly borne into his tent;"
10599,BOOK XIII.,"His friends had borne him off, and when the Chief"
10600,BOOK XIII.,"Had given him into skilful hands, he sought"
10601,BOOK XIII.,"The field again, still coveting renown.265"
10602,BOOK XIII.,"Him therefore, meeting him on his return,"
10603,BOOK XIII.,"Neptune bespake, but with the borrow’d voice"
10604,BOOK XIII.,"Of Thoas, offspring of Andræmon, King"
10605,BOOK XIII.,"In Pleuro and in lofty Calydon,"
10606,BOOK XIII.,And honor’d by the Ætolians as a God.270
10607,BOOK XIII.,Oh counsellor of Crete! our threats denounced
10608,BOOK XIII.,"Against the towers of Troy, where are they now?"
10609,BOOK XIII.,"To whom the leader of the Cretans, thus,"
10610,BOOK XIII.,Idomeneus. For aught that I perceive
10611,BOOK XIII.,Thoas! no Grecian is this day in fault!275
10612,BOOK XIII.,"For we are all intelligent in arms,"
10613,BOOK XIII.,"None yields by fear oppress’d, none lull’d by sloth"
10614,BOOK XIII.,From battle shrinks; but such the pleasure seems
10615,BOOK XIII.,"Of Jove himself, that we should perish here"
10616,BOOK XIII.,"Inglorious, from our country far remote280"
10617,BOOK XIII.,"But, Thoas! (for thine heart was ever firm"
10618,BOOK XIII.,"In battle, and thyself art wont to rouse"
10619,BOOK XIII.,Whom thou observ’st remiss) now also fight
10620,BOOK XIII.,"As erst, and urge each leader of the host."
10621,BOOK XIII.,"Him answered, then, the Sovereign of the Deep.285"
10622,BOOK XIII.,Return that Grecian never from the shores
10623,BOOK XIII.,"Of Troy, Idomeneus! but may the dogs"
10624,BOOK XIII.,"Feast on him, who shall this day intermit"
10625,BOOK XIII.,Through wilful negligence his force in fight!
10626,BOOK XIII.,"But haste, take arms and come; we must exert290"
10627,BOOK XIII.,"All diligence, that, being only two,"
10628,BOOK XIII.,We yet may yield some service. Union much
10629,BOOK XIII.,"Emboldens even the weakest, and our might"
10630,BOOK XIII.,Hath oft been proved on warriors of renown.
10631,BOOK XIII.,"So Neptune spake, and, turning, sought again295"
10632,BOOK XIII.,"The toilsome field. Ere long, Idomeneus"
10633,BOOK XIII.,"Arriving in his spacious tent, put on"
10634,BOOK XIII.,"His radiant armor, and, two spears in hand,"
10635,BOOK XIII.,Set forth like lightning which Saturnian Jove
10636,BOOK XIII.,"From bright Olympus shakes into the air,300"
10637,BOOK XIII.,"A sign to mortal men, dazzling all eyes;"
10638,BOOK XIII.,So beam’d the Hero’s armor as he ran.
10639,BOOK XIII.,But him not yet far distant from his tent
10640,BOOK XIII.,"Meriones, his fellow-warrior met,"
10641,BOOK XIII.,"For he had left the fight, seeking a spear,305"
10642,BOOK XIII.,When thus the brave Idomeneus began.
10643,BOOK XIII.,Swift son of Molus! chosen companion dear!
10644,BOOK XIII.,"Wherefore, Meriones, hast thou the field"
10645,BOOK XIII.,Abandon’d? Art thou wounded? Bring’st thou home
10646,BOOK XIII.,Some pointed mischief in thy flesh infixt?310
10647,BOOK XIII.,"Or comest thou sent to me, who of myself"
10648,BOOK XIII.,"The still tent covet not, but feats of arms?"
10649,BOOK XIII.,"To whom Meriones discreet replied,"
10650,BOOK XIII.,"Chief leader of the Cretans, brazen-mail’d"
10651,BOOK XIII.,Idomeneus! if yet there be a spear315
10652,BOOK XIII.,"Left in thy tent, I seek one; for I broke"
10653,BOOK XIII.,"The spear, even now, with which erewhile I fought,"
10654,BOOK XIII.,Smiting the shield of fierce Deiphobus.
10655,BOOK XIII.,"Then answer thus the Cretan Chief return’d,"
10656,BOOK XIII.,"Valiant Idomeneus. If spears thou need,320"
10657,BOOK XIII.,"Within my tent, leaning against the wall,"
10658,BOOK XIII.,"Stand twenty spears and one, forged all in Troy,"
10659,BOOK XIII.,Which from the slain I took; for distant fight
10660,BOOK XIII.,Me suits not; therefore in my tent have I
10661,BOOK XIII.,"Both spears and bossy shields, with brazen casques325"
10662,BOOK XIII.,And corselets bright that smile against the sun.
10663,BOOK XIII.,"Him answer’d, then, Meriones discreet."
10664,BOOK XIII.,"I also, at my tent and in my ship"
10665,BOOK XIII.,"Have many Trojan spoils, but they are hence"
10666,BOOK XIII.,Far distant. I not less myself than thou330
10667,BOOK XIII.,"Am ever mindful of a warrior’s part,"
10668,BOOK XIII.,"And when the din of glorious arms is heard,"
10669,BOOK XIII.,Fight in the van. If other Greeks my deeds
10670,BOOK XIII.,"Know not, at least I judge them known to thee."
10671,BOOK XIII.,To whom the leader of the host of Crete335
10672,BOOK XIII.,"Idomeneus. I know thy valor well,"
10673,BOOK XIII.,Why speakest thus to me? Choose we this day
10674,BOOK XIII.,"An ambush forth of all the bravest Greeks,"
10675,BOOK XIII.,(For in the ambush is distinguish’d best
10676,BOOK XIII.,The courage; there the timorous and the bold340
10677,BOOK XIII.,Plainly appear; the dastard changes hue
10678,BOOK XIII.,"And shifts from place to place, nor can he calm"
10679,BOOK XIII.,"The fears that shake his trembling limbs, but sits"
10680,BOOK XIII.,"Low-crouching on his hams, while in his breast"
10681,BOOK XIII.,"Quick palpitates his death-foreboding heart,345"
10682,BOOK XIII.,And his teeth chatter; but the valiant man
10683,BOOK XIII.,His posture shifts not; no excessive fears
10684,BOOK XIII.,"Feels he, but seated once in ambush, deems"
10685,BOOK XIII.,Time tedious till the bloody fight begin;)
10686,BOOK XIII.,"Even there, thy courage should no blame incur.[8]350"
10687,BOOK XIII.,"For should’st thou, toiling in the fight, by spear"
10688,BOOK XIII.,"Or falchion bleed, not on thy neck behind"
10689,BOOK XIII.,"Would fall the weapon, or thy back annoy,"
10690,BOOK XIII.,But it would meet thy bowels or thy chest
10691,BOOK XIII.,While thou didst rush into the clamorous van.355
10692,BOOK XIII.,But haste—we may not longer loiter here
10693,BOOK XIII.,"As children prating, lest some sharp rebuke"
10694,BOOK XIII.,"Reward us. Enter quick, and from within"
10695,BOOK XIII.,My tent provide thee with a noble spear.
10696,BOOK XIII.,"Then, swift as Mars, Meriones produced360"
10697,BOOK XIII.,A brazen spear of those within the tent
10698,BOOK XIII.,"Reserved, and kindling with heroic fire"
10699,BOOK XIII.,Follow’d Idomeneus. As gory Mars
10700,BOOK XIII.,"By Terror follow’d, his own dauntless son"
10701,BOOK XIII.,"Who quells the boldest heart, to battle moves;365"
10702,BOOK XIII.,"From Thrace against the Ephyri they arm,"
10703,BOOK XIII.,"Or hardy Phlegyans, and by both invoked,"
10704,BOOK XIII.,Hear and grant victory to which they please;
10705,BOOK XIII.,"Such, bright in arms Meriones, and such"
10706,BOOK XIII.,"Idomeneus advanced, when foremost thus370"
10707,BOOK XIII.,Meriones his fellow-chief bespake.
10708,BOOK XIII.,Son of Deucalion! where inclinest thou most
10709,BOOK XIII.,To enter into battle? On the right
10710,BOOK XIII.,Of all the host? or through the central ranks?
10711,BOOK XIII.,Or on the left? for nowhere I account375
10712,BOOK XIII.,The Greeks so destitute of force as there.
10713,BOOK XIII.,Then answer thus Idomeneus return’d
10714,BOOK XIII.,Chief of the Cretans. Others stand to guard
10715,BOOK XIII.,"The middle fleet; there either Ajax wars,"
10716,BOOK XIII.,"And Teucer, noblest archer of the Greeks,380"
10717,BOOK XIII.,Nor less in stationary fight approved.
10718,BOOK XIII.,"Bent as he is on battle, they will task"
10719,BOOK XIII.,And urge to proof sufficiently the force
10720,BOOK XIII.,Of Priameïan Hector; burn his rage
10721,BOOK XIII.,"How fierce soever, he shall find it hard,385"
10722,BOOK XIII.,"With all his thirst of victory, to quell"
10723,BOOK XIII.,"Their firm resistance, and to fire the fleet,"
10724,BOOK XIII.,Let not Saturnian Jove cast down from heaven
10725,BOOK XIII.,Himself a flaming brand into the ships.
10726,BOOK XIII.,High towering Telamonian Ajax yields390
10727,BOOK XIII.,To no mere mortal by the common gift
10728,BOOK XIII.,"Sustain’d of Ceres, and whose flesh the spear"
10729,BOOK XIII.,"Can penetrate, or rocky fragment bruise;"
10730,BOOK XIII.,In standing fight Ajax would not retire
10731,BOOK XIII.,Even before that breaker of the ranks395
10732,BOOK XIII.,"Achilles, although far less swift than he."
10733,BOOK XIII.,"But turn we to the left, that we may learn"
10734,BOOK XIII.,"At once, if glorious death, or life be ours."
10735,BOOK XIII.,"Then, rapid as the God of war, his course"
10736,BOOK XIII.,"Meriones toward the left began,400"
10737,BOOK XIII.,As he enjoin’d. Soon as the Trojans saw
10738,BOOK XIII.,"Idomeneus advancing like a flame,"
10739,BOOK XIII.,And his compeer Meriones in arms
10740,BOOK XIII.,"All-radiant clad, encouraging aloud"
10741,BOOK XIII.,"From rank to rank each other, on they came405"
10742,BOOK XIII.,To the assault combined. Then soon arose
10743,BOOK XIII.,Sharp contest on the left of all the fleet.
10744,BOOK XIII.,"As when shrill winds blow vehement, what time"
10745,BOOK XIII.,"Dust deepest spreads the ways, by warring blasts"
10746,BOOK XIII.,"Upborne a sable cloud stands in the air,410"
10747,BOOK XIII.,Such was the sudden conflict; equal rage
10748,BOOK XIII.,To stain with gore the lance ruled every breast.
10749,BOOK XIII.,Horrent with quivering spears the fatal field
10750,BOOK XIII.,Frown’d on all sides; the brazen flashes dread
10751,BOOK XIII.,"Of numerous helmets, corselets furbish’d bright,415"
10752,BOOK XIII.,"And shields refulgent meeting, dull’d the eye,"
10753,BOOK XIII.,And turn’d it dark away. Stranger indeed
10754,BOOK XIII.,"Were he to fear, who could that strife have view’d"
10755,BOOK XIII.,"With heart elate, or spirit unperturb’d."
10756,BOOK XIII.,Two mighty sons of Saturn adverse parts420
10757,BOOK XIII.,"Took in that contest, purposing alike"
10758,BOOK XIII.,To many a valiant Chief sorrow and pain.
10759,BOOK XIII.,"Jove, for the honor of Achilles, gave"
10760,BOOK XIII.,"Success to Hector and the host of Troy,"
10761,BOOK XIII.,Not for complete destruction of the Greeks425
10762,BOOK XIII.,"At Ilium, but that glory might redound"
10763,BOOK XIII.,"To Thetis thence, and to her dauntless son."
10764,BOOK XIII.,"On the other side, the King of Ocean risen"
10765,BOOK XIII.,"Secretly from the hoary Deep, the host"
10766,BOOK XIII.,"Of Greece encouraged, whom he grieved to see430"
10767,BOOK XIII.,"Vanquish’d by Trojans, and with anger fierce"
10768,BOOK XIII.,Against the Thunderer burn’d on their behalf.
10769,BOOK XIII.,Alike from one great origin divine
10770,BOOK XIII.,"Sprang they, but Jove was elder, and surpass’d"
10771,BOOK XIII.,In various knowledge; therefore when he roused435
10772,BOOK XIII.,"Their courage, Neptune traversed still the ranks"
10773,BOOK XIII.,"Clandestine, and in human form disguised."
10774,BOOK XIII.,"Thus, these Immortal Two, straining the cord"
10775,BOOK XIII.,"Indissoluble of all-wasting war,"
10776,BOOK XIII.,"Alternate measured with it either host,440"
10777,BOOK XIII.,And loosed the joints of many a warrior bold.
10778,BOOK XIII.,"Then, loud exhorting (though himself with age"
10779,BOOK XIII.,"Half grey) the Achaians, into battle sprang"
10780,BOOK XIII.,"Idomeneus, and scatter’d, first, the foe,"
10781,BOOK XIII.,"Slaying Othryoneus, who, by the lure445"
10782,BOOK XIII.,"Of martial glory drawn, had left of late"
10783,BOOK XIII.,Cabesus. He Priam’s fair daughter woo’d
10784,BOOK XIII.,"Cassandra, but no nuptial gift vouchsafed"
10785,BOOK XIII.,"To offer, save a sounding promise proud"
10786,BOOK XIII.,"To chase, himself, however resolute450"
10787,BOOK XIII.,"The Grecian host, and to deliver Troy."
10788,BOOK XIII.,"To him assenting, Priam, ancient King,"
10789,BOOK XIII.,"Assured to him his wish, and in the faith"
10790,BOOK XIII.,"Of that assurance confident, he fought."
10791,BOOK XIII.,But brave Idomeneus his splendid lance455
10792,BOOK XIII.,"Well-aim’d dismissing, struck the haughty Chief."
10793,BOOK XIII.,Pacing elate the field; his brazen mail
10794,BOOK XIII.,"Endured not; through his bowels pierced, with clang"
10795,BOOK XIII.,"Of all his arms he fell, and thus with joy"
10796,BOOK XIII.,"Immense exulting, spake Idomeneus.460"
10797,BOOK XIII.,"I give thee praise, Othryoneus! beyond"
10798,BOOK XIII.,"All mortal men, if truly thou perform"
10799,BOOK XIII.,"Thy whole big promise to the Dardan king,"
10800,BOOK XIII.,"Who promised thee his daughter. Now, behold,"
10801,BOOK XIII.,We also promise: doubt not the effect.465
10802,BOOK XIII.,We give into thy arms the most admired
10803,BOOK XIII.,"Of Agamemnon’s daughters, whom ourselves"
10804,BOOK XIII.,"Will hither bring from Argos, if thy force"
10805,BOOK XIII.,"With ours uniting, thou wilt rase the walls"
10806,BOOK XIII.,Of populous Troy. Come—follow me; that here470
10807,BOOK XIII.,Among the ships we may adjust the terms
10808,BOOK XIII.,"Of marriage, for we take not scanty dower."
10809,BOOK XIII.,"So saying, the Hero dragg’d him by his heel"
10810,BOOK XIII.,Through all the furious fight. His death to avenge
10811,BOOK XIII.,"Asius on foot before his steeds advanced,475"
10812,BOOK XIII.,"For them, where’er he moved, his charioteer"
10813,BOOK XIII.,Kept breathing ever on his neck behind.
10814,BOOK XIII.,With fierce desire the heart of Asius burn’d
10815,BOOK XIII.,"To smite Idomeneus, who with his lance"
10816,BOOK XIII.,"Him reaching first, pierced him beneath the chin480"
10817,BOOK XIII.,"Into his throat, and urged the weapon through."
10818,BOOK XIII.,"He fell, as some green poplar falls, or oak,"
10819,BOOK XIII.,"Or lofty pine, by naval artists hewn"
10820,BOOK XIII.,With new-edged axes on the mountain’s side.
10821,BOOK XIII.,"So, his teeth grinding, and the bloody dust485"
10822,BOOK XIII.,"Clenching, before his chariot and his steeds"
10823,BOOK XIII.,"Extended, Asius lay. His charioteer"
10824,BOOK XIII.,"(All recollection lost) sat panic-stunn’d,"
10825,BOOK XIII.,Nor dared for safety turn his steeds to flight.
10826,BOOK XIII.,Him bold Antilochus right through the waist490
10827,BOOK XIII.,"Transpierced; his mail sufficed not, but the spear"
10828,BOOK XIII.,Implanted in his midmost bowels stood.
10829,BOOK XIII.,Down from his seat magnificent he fell
10830,BOOK XIII.,"Panting, and young Antilochus the steeds"
10831,BOOK XIII.,Drove captive thence into the host of Greece.495
10832,BOOK XIII.,Then came Deiphobus by sorrow urged
10833,BOOK XIII.,"For Asius, and, small interval between,"
10834,BOOK XIII.,Hurl’d at Idomeneus his glittering lance;
10835,BOOK XIII.,"But he, foreseeing its approach, the point"
10836,BOOK XIII.,"Eluded, cover’d whole by his round shield500"
10837,BOOK XIII.,"Of hides and brass by double belt sustain’d,"
10838,BOOK XIII.,"And it flew over him, but on his targe"
10839,BOOK XIII.,"Glancing, elicited a tinkling sound."
10840,BOOK XIII.,"Yet left it not in vain his vigorous grasp,"
10841,BOOK XIII.,"But pierced the liver of Hypsenor, son505"
10842,BOOK XIII.,"Of Hippasus; he fell incontinent,"
10843,BOOK XIII.,And measureless exulting in his fall
10844,BOOK XIII.,Deiphobus with mighty voice exclaim’d.
10845,BOOK XIII.,Not unavenged lies Asius; though he seek
10846,BOOK XIII.,"Hell’s iron portals, yet shall he rejoice,510"
10847,BOOK XIII.,For I have given him a conductor home.
10848,BOOK XIII.,"So he, whose vaunt the Greeks indignant heard!"
10849,BOOK XIII.,But of them all to anger most he roused
10850,BOOK XIII.,"Antilochus, who yet his breathless friend[9]"
10851,BOOK XIII.,"Left not, but hasting, fenced him with his shield,515"
10852,BOOK XIII.,And brave Alastor with Mecisteus son
10853,BOOK XIII.,"Of Echius, bore him to the hollow ships"
10854,BOOK XIII.,"Deep-groaning both, for of their band was he."
10855,BOOK XIII.,Nor yet Idomeneus his warlike rage
10856,BOOK XIII.,"Remitted aught, but persevering strove520"
10857,BOOK XIII.,"Either to plunge some Trojan in the shades,"
10858,BOOK XIII.,"Or fall himself, guarding the fleet of Greece."
10859,BOOK XIII.,Then slew he brave Alcathoüs the son
10860,BOOK XIII.,"Of Æsyeta, and the son-in-law"
10861,BOOK XIII.,"Of old Anchises, who to him had given525"
10862,BOOK XIII.,"The eldest-born of all his daughters fair,"
10863,BOOK XIII.,Hippodamia; dearly loved was she
10864,BOOK XIII.,"By both her parents in her virgin state,[10]"
10865,BOOK XIII.,"For that in beauty she surpass’d, in works"
10866,BOOK XIII.,"Ingenious, and in faculties of mind530"
10867,BOOK XIII.,All her coëvals; wherefore she was deem’d
10868,BOOK XIII.,Well worthy of the noblest prince of Troy.
10869,BOOK XIII.,"Him in that moment, Neptune by the arm"
10870,BOOK XIII.,"Quell’d of Idomeneus, his radiant eyes"
10871,BOOK XIII.,"Dimming, and fettering his proportion’d limbs.535"
10872,BOOK XIII.,All power of flight or to elude the stroke
10873,BOOK XIII.,"Forsook him, and while motionless he stood"
10874,BOOK XIII.,"As stands a pillar tall or towering oak,"
10875,BOOK XIII.,The hero of the Cretans with a spear
10876,BOOK XIII.,Transfix’d his middle chest. He split the mail540
10877,BOOK XIII.,Erewhile his bosom’s faithful guard; shrill rang
10878,BOOK XIII.,The shiver’d brass; sounding he fell; the beam
10879,BOOK XIII.,Implanted in his palpitating heart
10880,BOOK XIII.,"Shook to its topmost point, but, its force spent,"
10881,BOOK XIII.,"At last, quiescent, stood. Then loud exclaim’d545"
10882,BOOK XIII.,"Idomeneus, exulting in his fall."
10883,BOOK XIII.,What thinks Deiphobus? seems it to thee
10884,BOOK XIII.,"Vain boaster, that, three warriors slain for one,"
10885,BOOK XIII.,"We yield thee just amends? else, stand thyself"
10886,BOOK XIII.,Against me; learn the valor of a Chief550
10887,BOOK XIII.,The progeny of Jove; Jove first begat
10888,BOOK XIII.,"Crete’s guardian, Minos, from which Minos sprang"
10889,BOOK XIII.,"Deucalion, and from famed Deucalion, I;"
10890,BOOK XIII.,"I, sovereign of the numerous race of Crete’s"
10891,BOOK XIII.,"Extensive isle, and whom my galleys brought555"
10892,BOOK XIII.,"To these your shores at last, that I might prove"
10893,BOOK XIII.,"Thy curse, thy father’s, and a curse to Troy."
10894,BOOK XIII.,He spake; Deiphobus uncertain stood
10895,BOOK XIII.,"Whether, retreating, to engage the help"
10896,BOOK XIII.,"Of some heroic Trojan, or himself560"
10897,BOOK XIII.,To make the dread experiment alone.
10898,BOOK XIII.,"At length, as his discreeter course, he chose"
10899,BOOK XIII.,To seek Æneas; him he found afar
10900,BOOK XIII.,"Station’d, remotest of the host of Troy,"
10901,BOOK XIII.,For he resented evermore his worth565
10902,BOOK XIII.,By Priam[11] recompensed with cold neglect.
10903,BOOK XIII.,"Approaching him, in accents wing’d he said."
10904,BOOK XIII.,Æneas! Trojan Chief! If e’er thou lov’dst
10905,BOOK XIII.,"Thy sister’s husband, duty calls thee now"
10906,BOOK XIII.,To prove it. Haste—defend with me the dead570
10907,BOOK XIII.,"Alcathoüs, guardian of thy tender years,"
10908,BOOK XIII.,Slain by Idomeneus the spear-renown’d.
10909,BOOK XIII.,"So saying, he roused his spirit, and on fire"
10910,BOOK XIII.,"To combat with the Cretan, forth he sprang."
10911,BOOK XIII.,But fear seized not Idomeneus as fear575
10912,BOOK XIII.,May seize a nursling boy; resolved he stood
10913,BOOK XIII.,"As in the mountains, conscious of his force,"
10914,BOOK XIII.,The wild boar waits a coming multitude
10915,BOOK XIII.,Of boisterous hunters to his lone retreat;
10916,BOOK XIII.,"Arching his bristly spine he stands, his eyes580"
10917,BOOK XIII.,"Beam fire, and whetting his bright tusks, he burns"
10918,BOOK XIII.,"To drive, not dogs alone, but men to flight;"
10919,BOOK XIII.,"So stood the royal Cretan, and fled not,"
10920,BOOK XIII.,Expecting brave Æneas; yet his friends
10921,BOOK XIII.,"He summon’d, on Ascalaphus his eyes585"
10922,BOOK XIII.,"Fastening, on Aphareus, Deipyrus,"
10923,BOOK XIII.,"Meriones, and Antilochus, all bold"
10924,BOOK XIII.,"In battle, and in accents wing’d exclaim’d."
10925,BOOK XIII.,"Haste ye, my friends! to aid me, for I stand"
10926,BOOK XIII.,"Alone, nor undismay’d the coming wait590"
10927,BOOK XIII.,"Of swift Æneas, nor less brave than swift,"
10928,BOOK XIII.,"And who possesses fresh his flower of youth,"
10929,BOOK XIII.,Man’s prime advantage; were we match’d in years
10930,BOOK XIII.,"As in our spirits, either he should earn"
10931,BOOK XIII.,"At once the meed of deathless fame, or I.595"
10932,BOOK XIII.,"He said; they all unanimous approach’d,"
10933,BOOK XIII.,"Sloping their shields, and stood. On the other side"
10934,BOOK XIII.,"His aids Æneas call’d, with eyes toward"
10935,BOOK XIII.,"Paris, Deiphobus, Agenor, turn’d,"
10936,BOOK XIII.,His fellow-warriors bold; them follow’d all600
10937,BOOK XIII.,Their people as the pastured flock the ram
10938,BOOK XIII.,"To water, by the shepherd seen with joy;"
10939,BOOK XIII.,"Such joy Æneas felt, seeing, so soon,"
10940,BOOK XIII.,That numerous host attendant at his call.
10941,BOOK XIII.,"Then, for Alcathoüs, into contest close605"
10942,BOOK XIII.,Arm’d with long spears they rush’d; on every breast
10943,BOOK XIII.,"Dread rang the brazen corselet, each his foe"
10944,BOOK XIII.,"Assailing opposite; but two, the rest"
10945,BOOK XIII.,"Surpassing far, terrible both as Mars,"
10946,BOOK XIII.,"Æneas and Idomeneus, alike610"
10947,BOOK XIII.,Panted to pierce each other with the spear.
10948,BOOK XIII.,"Æneas, first, cast at Idomeneus,"
10949,BOOK XIII.,"But, warn’d, he shunn’d the weapon, and it pass’d."
10950,BOOK XIII.,Quivering in the soil Æneas’ lance
10951,BOOK XIII.,"Stood, hurl’d in vain, though by a forceful arm.615"
10952,BOOK XIII.,Not so the Cretan; at his waist he pierced
10953,BOOK XIII.,"Oenomaüs, his hollow corselet clave,"
10954,BOOK XIII.,And in his midmost bowels drench’d the spear;
10955,BOOK XIII.,"Down fell the Chief, and dying, clench’d the dust."
10956,BOOK XIII.,"Instant, his massy spear the King of Crete620"
10957,BOOK XIII.,"Pluck’d from the dead, but of his radiant arms"
10958,BOOK XIII.,"Despoil’d him not, by numerous weapons urged;"
10959,BOOK XIII.,"For now, time-worn, he could no longer make"
10960,BOOK XIII.,"Brisk sally, spring to follow his own spear,"
10961,BOOK XIII.,"Or shun another, or by swift retreat625"
10962,BOOK XIII.,"Vanish from battle, but the evil day"
10963,BOOK XIII.,Warded in stationary fight alone.
10964,BOOK XIII.,"At him retiring, therefore, step by step"
10965,BOOK XIII.,"Deiphobus, who had with bitterest hate"
10966,BOOK XIII.,"Long time pursued him, hurl’d his splendid lance,630"
10967,BOOK XIII.,"But yet again erroneous, for he pierced"
10968,BOOK XIII.,"Ascalaphus instead, offspring of Mars;"
10969,BOOK XIII.,Right through his shoulder flew the spear; he fell
10970,BOOK XIII.,"Incontinent, and dying, clench’d the dust."
10971,BOOK XIII.,But tidings none the brazen-throated Mars635
10972,BOOK XIII.,"Tempestuous yet received, that his own son"
10973,BOOK XIII.,"In bloody fight had fallen, for on the heights"
10974,BOOK XIII.,Olympian over-arch’d with clouds of gold
10975,BOOK XIII.,"He sat, where sat the other Powers divine,"
10976,BOOK XIII.,Prisoners together of the will of Jove.640
10977,BOOK XIII.,"Meantime, for slain Ascalaphus arose"
10978,BOOK XIII.,Conflict severe; Deiphobus his casque
10979,BOOK XIII.,"Resplendent seized, but swift as fiery Mars"
10980,BOOK XIII.,"Assailing him, Meriones his arm"
10981,BOOK XIII.,"Pierced with a spear, and from his idle hand645"
10982,BOOK XIII.,"Fallen, the casque sonorous struck the ground."
10983,BOOK XIII.,"Again, as darts the vulture on his prey,"
10984,BOOK XIII.,"Meriones assailing him, the lance"
10985,BOOK XIII.,"Pluck’d from his arm, and to his band retired."
10986,BOOK XIII.,"Then, casting his fraternal arms around650"
10987,BOOK XIII.,"Deiphobus, him young Polites led"
10988,BOOK XIII.,From the hoarse battle to his rapid steeds
10989,BOOK XIII.,"And his bright chariot in the distant rear,"
10990,BOOK XIII.,"Which bore him back to Troy, languid and loud-"
10991,BOOK XIII.,"Groaning, and bleeding from his recent wound.655"
10992,BOOK XIII.,"Still raged the war, and infinite arose"
10993,BOOK XIII.,"The clamor. Aphareus, Caletor’s son,"
10994,BOOK XIII.,"Turning to face Æneas, in his throat"
10995,BOOK XIII.,Instant the hero’s pointed lance received.
10996,BOOK XIII.,"With head reclined, and bearing to the ground660"
10997,BOOK XIII.,"Buckler and helmet with him, in dark shades"
10998,BOOK XIII.,"Of soul-divorcing death involved, he fell."
10999,BOOK XIII.,"Antilochus, observing Thoön turn’d"
11000,BOOK XIII.,"To flight, that moment pierced him; from his back"
11001,BOOK XIII.,He ripp’d the vein which through the trunk its course665
11002,BOOK XIII.,Winds upward to the neck; that vein he ripp’d
11003,BOOK XIII.,"All forth; supine he fell, and with both hands"
11004,BOOK XIII.,"Extended to his fellow-warriors, died."
11005,BOOK XIII.,"Forth sprang Antilochus to strip his arms,"
11006,BOOK XIII.,"But watch’d, meantime, the Trojans, who in crowds670"
11007,BOOK XIII.,"Encircling him, his splendid buckler broad"
11008,BOOK XIII.,"Smote oft, but none with ruthless point prevail’d"
11009,BOOK XIII.,"Even to inscribe the skin of Nestor’s son,"
11010,BOOK XIII.,"Whom Neptune, shaker of the shores, amid"
11011,BOOK XIII.,Innumerable darts kept still secure.675
11012,BOOK XIII.,"Yet never from his foes he shrank, but faced"
11013,BOOK XIII.,"From side to side, nor idle slept his spear,"
11014,BOOK XIII.,But with rotation ceaseless turn’d and turn’d
11015,BOOK XIII.,"To every part, now levell’d at a foe"
11016,BOOK XIII.,"Far-distant, at a foe, now, near at hand.680"
11017,BOOK XIII.,"Nor he, thus occupied, unseen escaped"
11018,BOOK XIII.,"By Asius’ offspring Adamas, who close"
11019,BOOK XIII.,"Advancing, struck the centre of his shield."
11020,BOOK XIII.,But Neptune azure-hair’d so dear a life
11021,BOOK XIII.,"Denied to Adamas, and render’d vain685"
11022,BOOK XIII.,The weapon; part within his disk remain’d
11023,BOOK XIII.,"Like a seer’d stake, and part fell at his feet."
11024,BOOK XIII.,"Then Adamas, for his own life alarm’d,"
11025,BOOK XIII.,"Retired, but as he went, Meriones"
11026,BOOK XIII.,"Him reaching with his lance, the shame between690"
11027,BOOK XIII.,"And navel pierced him, where the stroke of Mars"
11028,BOOK XIII.,Proves painful most to miserable man.
11029,BOOK XIII.,"There enter’d deep the weapon; down he fell,"
11030,BOOK XIII.,And in the dust lay panting as an ox
11031,BOOK XIII.,Among the mountains pants by peasants held695
11032,BOOK XIII.,"In twisted bands, and dragg’d perforce along;"
11033,BOOK XIII.,"So panted dying Adamas, but soon"
11034,BOOK XIII.,"Ceased, for Meriones, approaching, pluck’d"
11035,BOOK XIII.,"The weapon forth, and darkness veil’d his eyes."
11036,BOOK XIII.,"Helenus, with his heavy Thracian blade700"
11037,BOOK XIII.,"Smiting the temples of Deipyrus,"
11038,BOOK XIII.,Dash’d off his helmet; from his brows remote
11039,BOOK XIII.,"It fell, and wandering roll’d, till at his feet"
11040,BOOK XIII.,"Some warrior found it, and secured; meantime"
11041,BOOK XIII.,The sightless shades of death him wrapp’d around.705
11042,BOOK XIII.,Grief at that spectacle the bosom fill’d
11043,BOOK XIII.,Of valiant Menelaus; high he shook
11044,BOOK XIII.,"His radiant spear, and threatening him, advanced"
11045,BOOK XIII.,"On royal Helenus, who ready stood"
11046,BOOK XIII.,"With his bow bent. They met; impatient, one,710"
11047,BOOK XIII.,"To give his pointed lance its rapid course,"
11048,BOOK XIII.,"And one, to start his arrow from the nerve."
11049,BOOK XIII.,The arrow of the son of Priam struck
11050,BOOK XIII.,"Atrides’ hollow corselet, but the reed"
11051,BOOK XIII.,Glanced wide. As vetches or as swarthy beans715
11052,BOOK XIII.,"Leap from the van and fly athwart the floor,"
11053,BOOK XIII.,"By sharp winds driven, and by the winnower’s force,"
11054,BOOK XIII.,So from the corselet of the glorious Greek
11055,BOOK XIII.,Wide-wandering flew the bitter shaft away.
11056,BOOK XIII.,But Menelaus the left-hand transpierced720
11057,BOOK XIII.,"Of Helenus, and with the lance’s point"
11058,BOOK XIII.,Fasten’d it to his bow; shunning a stroke
11059,BOOK XIII.,"More fatal, Helenus into his band"
11060,BOOK XIII.,"Retired, his arm dependent at his side,"
11061,BOOK XIII.,"And trailing, as he went, the ashen beam;725"
11062,BOOK XIII.,"There, bold Agenor from his hand the lance"
11063,BOOK XIII.,"Drew forth, then folded it with softest wool"
11064,BOOK XIII.,"Around, sling-wool, and borrow’d from the sling"
11065,BOOK XIII.,Which his attendant into battle bore.
11066,BOOK XIII.,Then sprang Pisander on the glorious Chief730
11067,BOOK XIII.,"The son of Atreus, but his evil fate"
11068,BOOK XIII.,"Beckon’d him to his death in conflict fierce,"
11069,BOOK XIII.,"Oh Menelaus, mighty Chief! with thee."
11070,BOOK XIII.,"And now they met, small interval between."
11071,BOOK XIII.,"Atrides hurl’d his weapon, and it err’d.735"
11072,BOOK XIII.,Pisander with his spear struck full the shield
11073,BOOK XIII.,"Of glorious Menelaus, but his force"
11074,BOOK XIII.,Resisted by the stubborn buckler broad
11075,BOOK XIII.,"Fail’d to transpierce it, and the weapon fell"
11076,BOOK XIII.,"Snapp’d at the neck. Yet, when he struck, the heart740"
11077,BOOK XIII.,"Rebounded of Pisander, full of hope."
11078,BOOK XIII.,"But Menelaus, drawing his bright blade,"
11079,BOOK XIII.,"Sprang on him, while Pisander from behind"
11080,BOOK XIII.,His buckler drew a brazen battle-axe
11081,BOOK XIII.,"By its long haft of polish’d olive-wood,745"
11082,BOOK XIII.,And both Chiefs struck together. He the crest
11083,BOOK XIII.,That crown’d the shaggy casque of Atreus’ son
11084,BOOK XIII.,"Hew’d from its base, but Menelaus him"
11085,BOOK XIII.,In his swift onset smote full on the front
11086,BOOK XIII.,"Above his nose; sounded the shatter’d bone,750"
11087,BOOK XIII.,And his eyes both fell bloody at his feet.
11088,BOOK XIII.,"Convolved with pain he lay; then, on his breast"
11089,BOOK XIII.,"Atrides setting fast his heel, tore off"
11090,BOOK XIII.,"His armor, and exulting thus began."
11091,BOOK XIII.,"So shall ye leave at length the Grecian fleet,755"
11092,BOOK XIII.,"Traitors, and never satisfied with war!"
11093,BOOK XIII.,"Nor want ye other guilt, dogs and profane!"
11094,BOOK XIII.,"But me have injured also, and defied"
11095,BOOK XIII.,The hot displeasure of high-thundering Jove
11096,BOOK XIII.,"The hospitable, who shall waste in time,760"
11097,BOOK XIII.,And level with the dust your lofty Troy.
11098,BOOK XIII.,"I wrong’d not you, yet bore ye far away"
11099,BOOK XIII.,"My youthful bride who welcomed you, and stole"
11100,BOOK XIII.,"My treasures also, and ye now are bent"
11101,BOOK XIII.,To burn Achaia’s gallant fleet with fire765
11102,BOOK XIII.,And slay her heroes; but your furious thirst
11103,BOOK XIII.,Of battle shall hereafter meet a check.
11104,BOOK XIII.,"Oh, Father Jove! Thee wisest we account"
11105,BOOK XIII.,"In heaven or earth, yet from thyself proceed"
11106,BOOK XIII.,"All these calamities, who favor show’st770"
11107,BOOK XIII.,"To this flagitious race the Trojans, strong"
11108,BOOK XIII.,"In wickedness alone, and whose delight"
11109,BOOK XIII.,In war and bloodshed never can be cloy’d.
11110,BOOK XIII.,"All pleasures breed satiety, sweet sleep,"
11111,BOOK XIII.,"Soft dalliance, music, and the graceful dance,775"
11112,BOOK XIII.,Though sought with keener appetite by most
11113,BOOK XIII.,Than bloody war; but Troy still covets blood.
11114,BOOK XIII.,"So spake the royal Chief, and to his friends"
11115,BOOK XIII.,"Pisander’s gory spoils consigning, flew"
11116,BOOK XIII.,To mingle in the foremost fight again.780
11117,BOOK XIII.,"Him, next, Harpalion, offspring of the King"
11118,BOOK XIII.,Pylæmenes assail’d; to Troy he came
11119,BOOK XIII.,"Following his sire, but never thence return’d."
11120,BOOK XIII.,"He, from small distance, smote the central boss"
11121,BOOK XIII.,"Of Menelaus’ buckler with his lance,785"
11122,BOOK XIII.,"But wanting power to pierce it, with an eye"
11123,BOOK XIII.,"Of cautious circumspection, lest perchance"
11124,BOOK XIII.,"Some spear should reach him, to his band retired."
11125,BOOK XIII.,But him retiring with a brazen shaft
11126,BOOK XIII.,Meriones pursued; swift flew the dart790
11127,BOOK XIII.,"To his right buttock, slipp’d beneath the bone,"
11128,BOOK XIII.,"His bladder grazed, and started through before."
11129,BOOK XIII.,There ended his retreat; sudden he sank
11130,BOOK XIII.,"And like a worm lay on the ground, his life"
11131,BOOK XIII.,"Exhaling in his fellow-warrior’s arms,795"
11132,BOOK XIII.,And with his sable blood soaking the plain.
11133,BOOK XIII.,"Around him flock’d his Paphlagonians bold,"
11134,BOOK XIII.,"And in his chariot placed drove him to Troy,"
11135,BOOK XIII.,"With whom his father went, mourning with tears"
11136,BOOK XIII.,"A son, whose death he never saw avenged.800"
11137,BOOK XIII.,"Him slain with indignation Paris view’d,"
11138,BOOK XIII.,"For he, with numerous Paphlagonians more"
11139,BOOK XIII.,"His guest had been; he, therefore, in the thirst"
11140,BOOK XIII.,"Of vengeance, sent a brazen arrow forth."
11141,BOOK XIII.,"There was a certain Greek, Euchenor, son805"
11142,BOOK XIII.,"Of Polyides the soothsayer, rich"
11143,BOOK XIII.,"And brave in fight, and who in Corinth dwelt"
11144,BOOK XIII.,"He, knowing well his fate, yet sail’d to Troy"
11145,BOOK XIII.,"For Polyides oft, his reverend sire,"
11146,BOOK XIII.,Had prophecied that he should either die810
11147,BOOK XIII.,"By some dire malady at home, or, slain"
11148,BOOK XIII.,"By Trojan hands, amid the fleet of Greece."
11149,BOOK XIII.,"He, therefore, shunning the reproach alike"
11150,BOOK XIII.,"Of the Achaians, and that dire disease,"
11151,BOOK XIII.,Had join’d the Grecian host; him Paris pierced815
11152,BOOK XIII.,The ear and jaw beneath; life at the stroke
11153,BOOK XIII.,"Left him, and darkness overspread his eyes."
11154,BOOK XIII.,So raged the battle like devouring fire.
11155,BOOK XIII.,"But Hector dear to Jove not yet had learn’d,"
11156,BOOK XIII.,Nor aught surmised the havoc of his host820
11157,BOOK XIII.,"Made on the left, where victory crown’d well-nigh"
11158,BOOK XIII.,The Grecians animated to the fight
11159,BOOK XIII.,By Neptune seconding himself their arms.
11160,BOOK XIII.,"He, where he first had started through the gate"
11161,BOOK XIII.,After dispersion of the shielded Greeks825
11162,BOOK XIII.,"Compact, still persevered. The galleys there"
11163,BOOK XIII.,Of Ajax and Protesilaüs stood
11164,BOOK XIII.,Updrawn above the hoary Deep; the wall
11165,BOOK XIII.,"Was there of humblest structure, and the steeds"
11166,BOOK XIII.,And warriors there conflicted furious most.830
11167,BOOK XIII.,The Epeans there and Iäonians[12] robed-
11168,BOOK XIII.,"Prolix, the Phthians,[13] Locrians, and the bold"
11169,BOOK XIII.,Bœtians check’d the terrible assault
11170,BOOK XIII.,"Of Hector, noble Chief, ardent as flame,"
11171,BOOK XIII.,Yet not repulsed him. Chosen Athenians form’d835
11172,BOOK XIII.,"The van, by Peteos’ son, Menestheus, led,"
11173,BOOK XIII.,"Whose high command undaunted Bias shared,"
11174,BOOK XIII.,Phidas and Stichius. The Epean host
11175,BOOK XIII.,"Under Amphion, Dracius, Meges, fought."
11176,BOOK XIII.,"Podarces brave in arms the Phthians ruled,840"
11177,BOOK XIII.,And Medon (Medon was by spurious birth
11178,BOOK XIII.,"Brother of Ajax Oïliades,"
11179,BOOK XIII.,"And for his uncle’s death, whom he had slain,"
11180,BOOK XIII.,"The brother of Oïleus’ wife, abode"
11181,BOOK XIII.,In Phylace; but from Iphiclus sprang845
11182,BOOK XIII.,"Podarces;) these, all station’d in the front"
11183,BOOK XIII.,"Of Phthias’ hardy sons, together strove"
11184,BOOK XIII.,With the Bœotians for the fleet’s defence.
11185,BOOK XIII.,Ajax the swift swerved never from the side
11186,BOOK XIII.,"Of Ajax son of Telamon a step,850"
11187,BOOK XIII.,But as in some deep fallow two black steers
11188,BOOK XIII.,"Labor combined, dragging the ponderous plow,"
11189,BOOK XIII.,The briny sweat around their rooted horns
11190,BOOK XIII.,"Oozes profuse; they, parted as they toil"
11191,BOOK XIII.,"Along the furrow, by the yoke alone,855"
11192,BOOK XIII.,"Cleave to its bottom sheer the stubborn glebe,"
11193,BOOK XIII.,"So, side by side, they, persevering fought.[14]"
11194,BOOK XIII.,The son of Telamon a people led
11195,BOOK XIII.,"Numerous and bold, who, when his bulky limbs"
11196,BOOK XIII.,"Fail’d overlabor’d, eased him of his shield.860"
11197,BOOK XIII.,Not so attended by his Locrians fought
11198,BOOK XIII.,Oïleus’ valiant son; pitch’d battle them
11199,BOOK XIII.,"Suited not, unprovided with bright casques"
11200,BOOK XIII.,"Of hairy crest, with ashen spears, and shields"
11201,BOOK XIII.,"Of ample orb; for, trusting in the bow865"
11202,BOOK XIII.,"And twisted sling alone, they came to Troy,"
11203,BOOK XIII.,And broke with shafts and volley’d stones the ranks.
11204,BOOK XIII.,"Thus occupying, clad in burnish’d arms,"
11205,BOOK XIII.,"The van, these two with Hector and his host"
11206,BOOK XIII.,"Conflicted, while the Locrians from behind870"
11207,BOOK XIII.,"Vex’d them with shafts, secure; nor could the men"
11208,BOOK XIII.,"Of Ilium stand, by such a shower confused."
11209,BOOK XIII.,"Then, driven with dreadful havoc thence, the foe"
11210,BOOK XIII.,To wind-swept Ilium had again retired.
11211,BOOK XIII.,"Had not Polydamas, at Hector’s side875"
11212,BOOK XIII.,"Standing, the dauntless hero thus address’d."
11213,BOOK XIII.,Hector! Thou ne’er canst listen to advice;
11214,BOOK XIII.,"But think’st thou, that if heaven in feats of arms"
11215,BOOK XIII.,"Give thee pre-eminence, thou must excel"
11216,BOOK XIII.,Therefore in council also all mankind?880
11217,BOOK XIII.,No. All-sufficiency is not for thee.
11218,BOOK XIII.,"To one, superior force in arms is given,"
11219,BOOK XIII.,"Skill to another in the graceful dance,"
11220,BOOK XIII.,"Sweet song and powers of music to a third,"
11221,BOOK XIII.,And to a fourth loud-thundering Jove imparts885
11222,BOOK XIII.,"Wisdom, which profits many, and which saves"
11223,BOOK XIII.,"Whole cities oft, though reverenced but by few."
11224,BOOK XIII.,Yet hear; I speak as wisest seems to me.
11225,BOOK XIII.,"War, like a fiery circle, all around"
11226,BOOK XIII.,"Environs thee; the Trojans, since they pass’d890"
11227,BOOK XIII.,"The bulwark, either hold themselves aloof,"
11228,BOOK XIII.,"Or, wide-dispersed among the galleys, cope"
11229,BOOK XIII.,With numbers far superior to their own.
11230,BOOK XIII.,"Retiring, therefore, summon all our Chiefs"
11231,BOOK XIII.,"To consultation on the sum of all,895"
11232,BOOK XIII.,Whether (should heaven so prosper us) to rush
11233,BOOK XIII.,"Impetuous on the gallant barks of Greece,"
11234,BOOK XIII.,Or to retreat secure; for much I dread
11235,BOOK XIII.,Lest the Achaians punctually refund
11236,BOOK XIII.,"All yesterday’s arrear, since yonder Chief[15]900"
11237,BOOK XIII.,Insatiable with battle still abides
11238,BOOK XIII.,"Within the fleet, nor longer, as I judge,"
11239,BOOK XIII.,Will rest a mere spectator of the field.
11240,BOOK XIII.,"So spake Polydamas, whose safe advice"
11241,BOOK XIII.,Pleased Hector; from his chariot down he leap’d905
11242,BOOK XIII.,"All arm’d, and in wing’d accents thus replied."
11243,BOOK XIII.,Polydamas! here gather all the Chiefs;
11244,BOOK XIII.,"I haste into the fight, and my commands"
11245,BOOK XIII.,"Once issued there, incontinent return."
11246,BOOK XIII.,"He ended, and conspicuous as the height910"
11247,BOOK XIII.,"Of some snow-crested mountain, shouting ranged"
11248,BOOK XIII.,The Trojans and confederates of Troy.
11249,BOOK XIII.,"They swift around Polydamas, brave son"
11250,BOOK XIII.,"Of Panthus, at the voice of Hector, ran."
11251,BOOK XIII.,"Himself with hasty strides the front, meantime,915"
11252,BOOK XIII.,"Of battle roam’d, seeking from rank to rank"
11253,BOOK XIII.,"Asius Hyrtacides, with Asius’ son"
11254,BOOK XIII.,"Adamas, and Deiphobus, and the might"
11255,BOOK XIII.,"Of Helenus, his royal brother bold."
11256,BOOK XIII.,Them neither altogether free from hurt920
11257,BOOK XIII.,"He found, nor living all. Beneath the sterns"
11258,BOOK XIII.,Of the Achaian ships some slaughter’d lay
11259,BOOK XIII.,By Grecian hands; some stricken by the spear
11260,BOOK XIII.,"Within the rampart sat, some by the sword."
11261,BOOK XIII.,"But leftward of the woful field he found,925"
11262,BOOK XIII.,"Ere long, bright Helen’s paramour his band"
11263,BOOK XIII.,"Exhorting to the fight. Hector approach’d,"
11264,BOOK XIII.,"And him, in fierce displeasure, thus bespake."
11265,BOOK XIII.,"Curst Paris, specious, fraudulent and lewd!"
11266,BOOK XIII.,"Where is Deiphobus, and where the might930"
11267,BOOK XIII.,Of royal Helenus? Where Adamas
11268,BOOK XIII.,"Offspring of Asius, and where Asius, son"
11269,BOOK XIII.,"Of Hyrtacus, and where Othryoneus?"
11270,BOOK XIII.,Now lofty Ilium from her topmost height
11271,BOOK XIII.,"Falls headlong, now is thy own ruin sure!935"
11272,BOOK XIII.,To whom the godlike Paris thus replied.
11273,BOOK XIII.,Since Hector! thou art pleased with no just cause
11274,BOOK XIII.,"To censure me, I may decline, perchance,"
11275,BOOK XIII.,"Much more the battle on some future day,"
11276,BOOK XIII.,"For I profess some courage, even I.940"
11277,BOOK XIII.,Witness our constant conflict with the Greeks
11278,BOOK XIII.,"Here, on this spot, since first led on by thee"
11279,BOOK XIII.,The host of Troy waged battle at the ships.
11280,BOOK XIII.,But those our friends of whom thou hast inquired
11281,BOOK XIII.,"Are slain, Deiphobus alone except945"
11282,BOOK XIII.,"And royal Helenus, who in the hand"
11283,BOOK XIII.,"Bear each a wound inflicted by the spear,"
11284,BOOK XIII.,And have retired; but Jove their life preserved.
11285,BOOK XIII.,Come now—conduct us whither most thine heart
11286,BOOK XIII.,"Prompts thee, and thou shalt find us ardent all950"
11287,BOOK XIII.,"To face like danger; what we can, we will,"
11288,BOOK XIII.,The best and most determined can no more.
11289,BOOK XIII.,"So saying, the hero soothed his brother’s mind."
11290,BOOK XIII.,Then moved they both toward the hottest war
11291,BOOK XIII.,"Together, where Polydamas the brave,955"
11292,BOOK XIII.,"Phalces, Cebriones, Orthæus fought,"
11293,BOOK XIII.,"Palmys and Polyphœtes, godlike Chief,"
11294,BOOK XIII.,"And Morys and Ascanius, gallant sons"
11295,BOOK XIII.,Both of Hippotion. They at Troy arrived
11296,BOOK XIII.,"From fair Ascania the preceding morn,960"
11297,BOOK XIII.,In recompense for aid[16] by Priam lent
11298,BOOK XIII.,"Erewhile to Phrygia, and, by Jove impell’d,"
11299,BOOK XIII.,Now waged the furious battle side by side.
11300,BOOK XIII.,"The march of these at once, was as the sound"
11301,BOOK XIII.,Of mighty winds from deep-hung thunder-clouds965
11302,BOOK XIII.,Descending; clamorous the blast and wild
11303,BOOK XIII.,"With ocean mingles; many a billow, then,"
11304,BOOK XIII.,"Upridged rides turbulent the sounding flood,"
11305,BOOK XIII.,"Foam-crested billow after billow driven,"
11306,BOOK XIII.,"So moved the host of Troy, rank after rank970"
11307,BOOK XIII.,"Behind their Chiefs, all dazzling bright in arms."
11308,BOOK XIII.,Before them Priameian Hector strode
11309,BOOK XIII.,"Fierce as gore-tainted Mars, and his broad shield"
11310,BOOK XIII.,"Advancing came, heavy with hides, and thick-"
11311,BOOK XIII.,Plated with brass; his helmet on his brows975
11312,BOOK XIII.,"Refulgent shook, and in its turn he tried"
11313,BOOK XIII.,"The force of every phalanx, if perchance"
11314,BOOK XIII.,Behind his broad shield pacing he might shake
11315,BOOK XIII.,Their steadfast order; but he bore not down
11316,BOOK XIII.,The spirit of the firm Achaian host.980
11317,BOOK XIII.,"Then Ajax striding forth, him, first, defied."
11318,BOOK XIII.,Approach. Why temptest thou the Greeks to fear?
11319,BOOK XIII.,No babes are we in aught that appertains
11320,BOOK XIII.,"To arms, though humbled by the scourge of Jove."
11321,BOOK XIII.,Thou cherishest the foolish hope to burn985
11322,BOOK XIII.,Our fleet with fire; but even we have hearts
11323,BOOK XIII.,"Prepared to guard it, and your populous Troy,"
11324,BOOK XIII.,"By us dismantled and to pillage given,"
11325,BOOK XIII.,Shall perish sooner far. Know this thyself
11326,BOOK XIII.,Also; the hour is nigh when thou shalt ask990
11327,BOOK XIII.,"In prayer to Jove and all the Gods of heaven,"
11328,BOOK XIII.,That speed more rapid than the falcon’s flight
11329,BOOK XIII.,"May wing thy coursers, while, exciting dense"
11330,BOOK XIII.,"The dusty plain, they whirl thee back to Troy."
11331,BOOK XIII.,"While thus he spake, sublime on the right-hand995"
11332,BOOK XIII.,An eagle soar’d; confident in the sign
11333,BOOK XIII.,The whole Achaian host with loud acclaim
11334,BOOK XIII.,Hail’d it. Then glorious Hector thus replied.
11335,BOOK XIII.,"Brainless and big, what means this boast of thine,"
11336,BOOK XIII.,Earth-cumberer Ajax? Would I were the son1000
11337,BOOK XIII.,"As sure, for ever, of almighty Jove"
11338,BOOK XIII.,"And Juno, and such honor might receive"
11339,BOOK XIII.,"Henceforth as Pallas and Apollo share,"
11340,BOOK XIII.,As comes this day with universal wo
11341,BOOK XIII.,"Fraught for the Grecians, among whom thyself1005"
11342,BOOK XIII.,Shalt also perish if thou dare abide
11343,BOOK XIII.,"My massy spear, which shall thy pamper’d flesh"
11344,BOOK XIII.,"Disfigure, and amid the barks of Greece"
11345,BOOK XIII.,"Falling, thou shalt the vultures with thy bulk"
11346,BOOK XIII.,"Enormous satiate, and the dogs of Troy.1010"
11347,BOOK XIII.,"He spake, and led his host; with clamor loud"
11348,BOOK XIII.,"They follow’d him, and all the distant rear"
11349,BOOK XIII.,Came shouting on. On the other side the Greeks
11350,BOOK XIII.,"Re-echoed shout for shout, all undismay’d,"
11351,BOOK XIII.,And waiting firm the bravest of their foes.1015
11352,BOOK XIII.,Upwent the double roar into the heights
11353,BOOK XIII.,"Ethereal, and among the beams of Jove."

11381,BOOK XIV.,I from yon eminence will learn the cause.
11382,BOOK XIV.,"So saying, he took a shield radiant with brass10"
11383,BOOK XIV.,"There lying in the tent, the shield well-forged"
11384,BOOK XIV.,"Of valiant Thrasymedes, his own son"
11385,BOOK XIV.,(For he had borne to fight his father’s shield)
11386,BOOK XIV.,And arming next his hand with a keen lance
11387,BOOK XIV.,Stood forth before the tent. Thence soon he saw15
11388,BOOK XIV.,"Foul deeds and strange, the Grecian host confused,"
11389,BOOK XIV.,Their broken ranks flying before the host
11390,BOOK XIV.,"Of Ilium, and the rampart overthrown."
11391,BOOK XIV.,"As when the wide sea, darken’d over all"
11392,BOOK XIV.,"Its silent flood, forebodes shrill winds to blow,20"
11393,BOOK XIV.,"The doubtful waves roll yet to neither side,"
11394,BOOK XIV.,Till swept at length by a decisive gale;[1]
11395,BOOK XIV.,"So stood the senior, with distressful doubts"
11396,BOOK XIV.,"Conflicting anxious, whether first to seek"
11397,BOOK XIV.,"The Grecian host, or Agamemnon’s self25"
11398,BOOK XIV.,"The sovereign, and at length that course preferr’d."
11399,BOOK XIV.,Meantime with mutual carnage they the field
11400,BOOK XIV.,"Spread far and wide, and by spears double-edged"
11401,BOOK XIV.,"Smitten, and by the sword their corselets rang."
11402,BOOK XIV.,"The royal Chiefs ascending from the fleet,30"
11403,BOOK XIV.,"Ulysses, Diomede, and Atreus’ son"
11404,BOOK XIV.,"Imperial Agamemnon, who had each"
11405,BOOK XIV.,"Bled in the battle, met him on his way."
11406,BOOK XIV.,For from the war remote they had updrawn
11407,BOOK XIV.,"Their galleys on the shore of the gray Deep,35"
11408,BOOK XIV.,"The foremost to the plain, and at the sterns"
11409,BOOK XIV.,Of that exterior line had built the wall.
11410,BOOK XIV.,"For, spacious though it were, the shore alone"
11411,BOOK XIV.,"That fleet sufficed not, incommoding much"
11412,BOOK XIV.,The people; wherefore they had ranged the ships40
11413,BOOK XIV.,"Line above line gradual, and the bay"
11414,BOOK XIV.,"Between both promontories, all was fill’d."
11415,BOOK XIV.,"They, therefore, curious to survey the fight,"
11416,BOOK XIV.,"Came forth together, leaning on the spear,"
11417,BOOK XIV.,"When Nestor met them; heavy were their hearts,45"
11418,BOOK XIV.,"And at the sight of him still more alarm’d,"
11419,BOOK XIV.,Whom royal Agamemnon thus bespake.
11420,BOOK XIV.,"Neleian Nestor, glory of the Greeks!"
11421,BOOK XIV.,"What moved thee to forsake yon bloody field,"

11424,BOOK XIV.,"Among the Trojans publish’d, verify,"
11425,BOOK XIV.,That he would never enter Ilium more
11426,BOOK XIV.,"Till he had burn’d our fleet, and slain ourselves."
11427,BOOK XIV.,"So threaten’d Hector, and shall now perform.55"
11428,BOOK XIV.,Alas! alas! the Achaians brazen-greaved
11429,BOOK XIV.,"All, like Achilles, have deserted me"
11430,BOOK XIV.,"Resentful, and decline their fleet’s defence."
11431,BOOK XIV.,To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied.
11432,BOOK XIV.,Those threats are verified; nor Jove himself60
11433,BOOK XIV.,The Thunderer can disappoint them now;
11434,BOOK XIV.,For our chief strength in which we trusted most
11435,BOOK XIV.,That it should guard impregnably secure
11436,BOOK XIV.,"Our navy and ourselves, the wall hath fallen."
11437,BOOK XIV.,Hence all this conflict by our host sustain’d65
11438,BOOK XIV.,Among the ships; nor could thy keenest sight
11439,BOOK XIV.,Inform thee where in the Achaian camp
11440,BOOK XIV.,"Confusion most prevails, such deaths are dealt"
11441,BOOK XIV.,"Promiscuous, and the cry ascends to heaven."
11442,BOOK XIV.,"But come—consult we on the sum of all,70"
11443,BOOK XIV.,"If counsel yet may profit. As for you,"
11444,BOOK XIV.,Ye shall have exhortation none from me
11445,BOOK XIV.,To seek the fight; the wounded have excuse.
11446,BOOK XIV.,"Whom Agamemnon answer’d, King of men."
11447,BOOK XIV.,Ah Nestor! if beneath our very sterns75
11448,BOOK XIV.,"The battle rage, if neither trench nor wall"
11449,BOOK XIV.,"Constructed with such labor, and supposed"
11450,BOOK XIV.,Of strength to guard impregnably secure
11451,BOOK XIV.,"Our navy and ourselves, avail us aught,"
11452,BOOK XIV.,It is because almighty Jove hath will’d80
11453,BOOK XIV.,That the Achaian host should perish here
11454,BOOK XIV.,"Inglorious, from their country far remote."
11455,BOOK XIV.,"When he vouchsafed assistance to the Greeks,"
11456,BOOK XIV.,"I knew it well; and now, not less I know"
11457,BOOK XIV.,That high as the immortal Gods he lifts85
11458,BOOK XIV.,"Our foes to glory, and depresses us."
11459,BOOK XIV.,"Haste therefore all, and act as I advise."
11460,BOOK XIV.,"Our ships—all those that nearest skirt the Deep,"
11461,BOOK XIV.,"Launch we into the sacred flood, and moor"
11462,BOOK XIV.,"With anchors safely, till o’ershadowing night90"
11463,BOOK XIV.,(If night itself may save us) shall arrive.
11464,BOOK XIV.,Then may we launch the rest; for I no shame
11465,BOOK XIV.,"Account it, even by ’vantage of the night"
11466,BOOK XIV.,To fly destruction. Wiser him I deem
11467,BOOK XIV.,"Who ’scapes his foe, than whom his foe enthralls.95"
11468,BOOK XIV.,"But him Ulysses, frowning stern, reproved."
11469,BOOK XIV.,"What word, Atrides, now hath pass’d thy lips?"
11470,BOOK XIV.,Counsellor of despair! thou should’st command
11471,BOOK XIV.,"(And would to heaven thou didst) a different host,"
11472,BOOK XIV.,"Some dastard race, not ours; whom Jove ordains100"
11473,BOOK XIV.,From youth to hoary age to weave the web
11474,BOOK XIV.,"Of toilsome warfare, till we perish all."
11475,BOOK XIV.,Wilt thou the spacious city thus renounce
11476,BOOK XIV.,For which such numerous woes we have endured?
11477,BOOK XIV.,Hush! lest some other hear; it is a word105
11478,BOOK XIV.,Which no man qualified by years mature
11479,BOOK XIV.,"To speak discreetly, no man bearing rule"
11480,BOOK XIV.,"O’er such a people as confess thy sway,"
11481,BOOK XIV.,Should suffer to contaminate his lips.
11482,BOOK XIV.,"I from my soul condemn thee, and condemn110"
11483,BOOK XIV.,"Thy counsel, who persuad’st us in the heat"
11484,BOOK XIV.,"Of battle terrible as this, to launch"
11485,BOOK XIV.,"Our fleet into the waves, that we may give"
11486,BOOK XIV.,"Our too successful foes their full desire,"
11487,BOOK XIV.,And that our own prepondering scale115
11488,BOOK XIV.,May plunge us past all hope; for while they draw
11489,BOOK XIV.,"Their galleys down, the Grecians shall but ill"
11490,BOOK XIV.,"Sustain the fight, seaward will cast their eyes"
11491,BOOK XIV.,"And shun the battle, bent on flight alone."
11492,BOOK XIV.,"Then, shall they rue thy counsel, King of men!120"
11493,BOOK XIV.,To whom the imperial leader of the Greeks.
11494,BOOK XIV.,"Thy sharp reproof, Ulysses, hath my soul"
11495,BOOK XIV.,Pierced deeply. Yet I gave no such command
11496,BOOK XIV.,"That the Achaians should their galleys launch,"
11497,BOOK XIV.,"Would they, or would they not. No. I desire125"
11498,BOOK XIV.,"That young or old, some other may advice"
11499,BOOK XIV.,"More prudent give, and he shall please me well."
11500,BOOK XIV.,Then thus the gallant Diomede replied.
11501,BOOK XIV.,"That man is near, and may ye but be found"
11502,BOOK XIV.,"Tractable, our inquiry shall be short.130"
11503,BOOK XIV.,"Be patient each, nor chide me nor reproach"
11504,BOOK XIV.,"Because I am of greener years than ye,"
11505,BOOK XIV.,"For I am sprung from an illustrious Sire,"
11506,BOOK XIV.,"From Tydeus, who beneath his hill of earth"
11507,BOOK XIV.,Lies now entomb’d at Thebes. Three noble sons135
11508,BOOK XIV.,"Were born to Portheus, who in Pleuro dwelt,"
11509,BOOK XIV.,And on the heights of Calydon; the first
11510,BOOK XIV.,Agrius; the second Melas; and the third
11511,BOOK XIV.,"Brave Oeneus, father of my father, famed"
11512,BOOK XIV.,For virtuous qualities above the rest.140
11513,BOOK XIV.,Oeneus still dwelt at home; but wandering thence
11514,BOOK XIV.,My father dwelt in Argos; so the will
11515,BOOK XIV.,"Of Jove appointed, and of all the Gods."
11516,BOOK XIV.,There he espoused the daughter of the King
11517,BOOK XIV.,"Adrastus, occupied a mansion rich145"
11518,BOOK XIV.,In all abundance; many a field possess’d
11519,BOOK XIV.,"Of wheat, well-planted gardens, numerous flocks,"
11520,BOOK XIV.,And was expert in spearmanship esteem’d
11521,BOOK XIV.,Past all the Grecians. I esteem’d it right
11522,BOOK XIV.,"That ye should hear these things, for they are true.150"
11523,BOOK XIV.,"Ye will not, therefore, as I were obscure"
11524,BOOK XIV.,"And of ignoble origin, reject"
11525,BOOK XIV.,What I shall well advise. Expedience bids
11526,BOOK XIV.,"That, wounded as we are, we join the host."
11527,BOOK XIV.,We will preserve due distance from the range155
11528,BOOK XIV.,"Of spears and arrows, lest already gall’d,"
11529,BOOK XIV.,We suffer worse; but we will others urge
11530,BOOK XIV.,"To combat, who have stood too long aloof,"
11531,BOOK XIV.,Attentive only to their own repose.
11532,BOOK XIV.,"He spake, whom all approved, and forth they went,160"
11533,BOOK XIV.,Imperial Agamemnon at their head.
11534,BOOK XIV.,Nor watch’d the glorious Shaker of the shores
11535,BOOK XIV.,"In vain, but like a man time-worn approach’d,"
11536,BOOK XIV.,"And, seizing Agamemnon’s better hand,"
11537,BOOK XIV.,In accents wing’d the monarch thus address’d.165
11538,BOOK XIV.,Atrides! now exults the vengeful heart
11539,BOOK XIV.,"Of fierce Achilles, viewing at his ease"
11540,BOOK XIV.,The flight and slaughter of Achaia’s host;
11541,BOOK XIV.,"For he is mad, and let him perish such,"
11542,BOOK XIV.,And may his portion from the Gods be shame!170
11543,BOOK XIV.,"But as for thee, not yet the powers of heaven"
11544,BOOK XIV.,Thee hate implacable; the Chiefs of Troy
11545,BOOK XIV.,Shall cover yet with cloudy dust the breadth
11546,BOOK XIV.,"Of all the plain, and backward from the camp"
11547,BOOK XIV.,To Ilium’s gates thyself shalt see them driven.175
11548,BOOK XIV.,"He ceased, and shouting traversed swift the field."
11549,BOOK XIV.,Loud as nine thousand or ten thousand shout
11550,BOOK XIV.,"In furious battle mingled, Neptune sent"
11551,BOOK XIV.,"His voice abroad, force irresistible"
11552,BOOK XIV.,"Infusing into every Grecian heart,180"
11553,BOOK XIV.,And thirst of battle not to be assuaged.
11554,BOOK XIV.,But Juno of the golden throne stood forth
11555,BOOK XIV.,"On the Olympian summit, viewing thence"
11556,BOOK XIV.,"The field, where clear distinguishing the God"
11557,BOOK XIV.,"Of ocean, her own brother, sole engaged185"
11558,BOOK XIV.,"Amid the glorious battle, glad was she."
11559,BOOK XIV.,Seeing Jove also on the topmost point
11560,BOOK XIV.,"Of spring-fed Ida seated, she conceived"
11561,BOOK XIV.,"Hatred against him, and thenceforth began"
11562,BOOK XIV.,Deliberate how best she might deceive190
11563,BOOK XIV.,"The Thunderer, and thus at last resolved;"
11564,BOOK XIV.,Attired with skill celestial to descend
11565,BOOK XIV.,"On Ida, with a hope to allure him first"
11566,BOOK XIV.,"Won by her beauty to a fond embrace,"
11567,BOOK XIV.,Then closing fast in balmy sleep profound195
11568,BOOK XIV.,"His eyes, to elude his vigilance, secure."
11569,BOOK XIV.,She sought her chamber; Vulcan her own son
11570,BOOK XIV.,"That chamber built. He framed the solid doors,"
11571,BOOK XIV.,And to the posts fast closed them with a key
11572,BOOK XIV.,"Mysterious, which, herself except, in heaven200"
11573,BOOK XIV.,None understood. Entering she secured
11574,BOOK XIV.,"The splendid portal. First, she laved all o’er"
11575,BOOK XIV.,"Her beauteous body with ambrosial lymph,"
11576,BOOK XIV.,Then polish’d it with richest oil divine
11577,BOOK XIV.,Of boundless fragrance;[2] oil that in the courts205
11578,BOOK XIV.,"Eternal only shaken, through the skies"
11579,BOOK XIV.,"Breathed odors, and through all the distant earth."
11580,BOOK XIV.,"Her whole fair body with those sweets bedew’d,"
11581,BOOK XIV.,"She passed the comb through her ambrosial hair,"
11582,BOOK XIV.,And braided her bright locks streaming profuse210
11583,BOOK XIV.,From her immortal brows; with golden studs
11584,BOOK XIV.,"She made her gorgeous mantle fast before,"
11585,BOOK XIV.,"Ethereal texture, labor of the hands"
11586,BOOK XIV.,"Of Pallas beautified with various art,"
11587,BOOK XIV.,And braced it with a zone fringed all around215
11588,BOOK XIV.,A hundred fold; her pendants triple-gemm’d
11589,BOOK XIV.,"Luminous, graceful, in her ears she hung,"
11590,BOOK XIV.,And covering all her glories with a veil
11591,BOOK XIV.,"Sun-bright, new-woven, bound to her fair feet"
11592,BOOK XIV.,"Her sandals elegant. Thus full attired,220"
11593,BOOK XIV.,"In all her ornaments, she issued forth,"
11594,BOOK XIV.,And beckoning Venus from the other powers
11595,BOOK XIV.,"Of heaven apart, the Goddess thus bespake."
11596,BOOK XIV.,"Daughter beloved! shall I obtain my suit,"
11597,BOOK XIV.,"Or wilt thou thwart me, angry that I aid225"
11598,BOOK XIV.,"The Grecians, while thine aid is given to Troy?"
11599,BOOK XIV.,To whom Jove’s daughter Venus thus replied.
11600,BOOK XIV.,"What would majestic Juno, daughter dread"
11601,BOOK XIV.,"Of Saturn, sire of Jove? I feel a mind"
11602,BOOK XIV.,"Disposed to gratify thee, if thou ask230"
11603,BOOK XIV.,"Things possible, and possible to me."
11604,BOOK XIV.,Then thus with wiles veiling her deep design
11605,BOOK XIV.,"Imperial Juno. Give me those desires,"
11606,BOOK XIV.,That love-enkindling power by which thou sway’st
11607,BOOK XIV.,"Immortal hearts and mortal, all alike;235"
11608,BOOK XIV.,"For to the green earth’s utmost bounds I go,"
11609,BOOK XIV.,"To visit there the parent of the Gods,"
11610,BOOK XIV.,"Oceanus, and Tethys his espoused,"
11611,BOOK XIV.,Mother of all. They kindly from the hands
11612,BOOK XIV.,"Of Rhea took, and with parental care240"
11613,BOOK XIV.,"Sustain’d and cherish’d me, what time from heaven"
11614,BOOK XIV.,"The Thunderer hurled down Saturn, and beneath"
11615,BOOK XIV.,The earth fast bound him and the barren Deep.
11616,BOOK XIV.,"Them go I now to visit, and their feuds"
11617,BOOK XIV.,Innumerable to compose; for long245
11618,BOOK XIV.,They have from conjugal embrace abstain’d
11619,BOOK XIV.,"Through mutual wrath, whom by persuasive speech"
11620,BOOK XIV.,"Might I restore into each other’s arms,"
11621,BOOK XIV.,They would for ever love me and revere.
11622,BOOK XIV.,"Her, foam-born Venus then, Goddess of smiles,250"
11623,BOOK XIV.,"Thus answer’d. Thy request, who in the arms"
11624,BOOK XIV.,"Of Jove reposest the omnipotent,"
11625,BOOK XIV.,Nor just it were nor seemly to refuse.
11626,BOOK XIV.,"So saying, the cincture from her breast she loosed"
11627,BOOK XIV.,"Embroider’d, various, her all-charming zone.255"
11628,BOOK XIV.,"It was an ambush of sweet snares, replete"
11629,BOOK XIV.,"With love, desire, soft intercourse of hearts,"
11630,BOOK XIV.,And music of resistless whisper’d sounds
11631,BOOK XIV.,That from the wisest steal their best resolves;
11632,BOOK XIV.,She placed it in her hands and thus she said.260
11633,BOOK XIV.,Take this—this girdle fraught with every charm.
11634,BOOK XIV.,"Hide this within thy bosom, and return,"
11635,BOOK XIV.,"Whate’er thy purpose, mistress of it all."
11636,BOOK XIV.,"She spake; imperial Juno smiled, and still"
11637,BOOK XIV.,"Smiling complacent, bosom’d safe the zone.265"
11638,BOOK XIV.,"Then Venus to her father’s court return’d,"
11639,BOOK XIV.,"And Juno, starting from the Olympian height,"
11640,BOOK XIV.,O’erflew Pieria and the lovely plains
11641,BOOK XIV.,Of broad Emathia; soaring thence she swept
11642,BOOK XIV.,The snow-clad summits of the Thracian hills270
11643,BOOK XIV.,"Steed-famed, nor printed, as she passed, the soil."
11644,BOOK XIV.,From Athos o’er the foaming billows borne
11645,BOOK XIV.,"She came to Lemnos, city and abode"
11646,BOOK XIV.,"Of noble Thoas, and there meeting Sleep,"
11647,BOOK XIV.,"Brother of Death, she press’d his hand, and said,275"
11648,BOOK XIV.,"Sleep, over all, both Gods and men, supreme!"
11649,BOOK XIV.,"If ever thou hast heard, hear also now"
11650,BOOK XIV.,My suit; I will be grateful evermore.
11651,BOOK XIV.,Seal for me fast the radiant eyes of Jove
11652,BOOK XIV.,In the instant of his gratified desire.280
11653,BOOK XIV.,"Thy recompense shall be a throne of gold,"
11654,BOOK XIV.,"Bright, incorruptible; my limping son,"
11655,BOOK XIV.,"Vulcan, shall fashion it himself with art"
11656,BOOK XIV.,"Laborious, and, beneath, shall place a stool[3]"
11657,BOOK XIV.,"For thy fair feet, at the convivial board.285"
11658,BOOK XIV.,Then answer thus the tranquil Sleep returned
11659,BOOK XIV.,"Great Saturn’s daughter, awe-inspiring Queen!"
11660,BOOK XIV.,All other of the everlasting Gods
11661,BOOK XIV.,"I could with ease make slumber, even the streams"
11662,BOOK XIV.,"Of Ocean, Sire of all.[4] Not so the King290"
11663,BOOK XIV.,"The son of Saturn: him, unless himself"
11664,BOOK XIV.,"Give me command, I dare not lull to rest,"
11665,BOOK XIV.,"Or even approach him, taught as I have been"
11666,BOOK XIV.,Already in the school of thy commands
11667,BOOK XIV.,That wisdom. I forget not yet the day295
11668,BOOK XIV.,"When, Troy laid waste, that valiant son[5] of his"
11669,BOOK XIV.,Sail’d homeward: then my influence I diffused
11670,BOOK XIV.,Soft o’er the sovereign intellect of Jove;
11671,BOOK XIV.,"While thou, against the Hero plotting harm,"
11672,BOOK XIV.,"Didst rouse the billows with tempestuous blasts,300"
11673,BOOK XIV.,"And separating him from all his friend,"
11674,BOOK XIV.,"Brought’st him to populous Cos. Then Jove awoke,"
11675,BOOK XIV.,"And, hurling in his wrath the Gods about,"
11676,BOOK XIV.,"Sought chiefly me, whom far below all ken"
11677,BOOK XIV.,"He had from heaven cast down into the Deep,305"
11678,BOOK XIV.,"But Night, resistless vanquisher of all,"
11679,BOOK XIV.,"Both Gods and men, preserved me; for to her"
11680,BOOK XIV.,"I fled for refuge. So the Thunderer cool’d,"
11681,BOOK XIV.,"Though sore displeased, and spared me through a fear"
11682,BOOK XIV.,To violate the peaceful sway of Night.[6]310
11683,BOOK XIV.,And thou wouldst now embroil me yet again!
11684,BOOK XIV.,To whom majestic Juno thus replied.
11685,BOOK XIV.,"Ah, wherefore, Sleep! shouldst thou indulge a fear"
11686,BOOK XIV.,So groundless?  Chase it from thy mind afar.
11687,BOOK XIV.,Think’st thou the Thunderer as intent to serve315
11688,BOOK XIV.,"The Trojans, and as jealous in their cause"
11689,BOOK XIV.,"As erst for Hercules, his genuine son?"
11690,BOOK XIV.,"Come then, and I will bless thee with a bride;"
11691,BOOK XIV.,"One of the younger Graces shall be thine,"
11692,BOOK XIV.,"Pasithea, day by day still thy desire.320"
11693,BOOK XIV.,"She spake; Sleep heard delighted, and replied."
11694,BOOK XIV.,By the inviolable Stygian flood
11695,BOOK XIV.,Swear to me; lay thy right hand on the glebe
11696,BOOK XIV.,"All-teeming, lay thy other on the face"
11697,BOOK XIV.,"Of the flat sea, that all the Immortal Powers325"
11698,BOOK XIV.,Who compass Saturn in the nether realms
11699,BOOK XIV.,"May witness, that thou givest me for a bride"
11700,BOOK XIV.,"The younger Grace whom thou hast named, divine"
11701,BOOK XIV.,"Pasithea, day by day still my desire."
11702,BOOK XIV.,"He said, nor beauteous Juno not complied,330"
11703,BOOK XIV.,"But sware, by name invoking all the powers"
11704,BOOK XIV.,Titanian call’d who in the lowest gulf
11705,BOOK XIV.,"Dwell under Tartarus, omitting none."
11706,BOOK XIV.,"Her oath with solemn ceremonial sworn,"
11707,BOOK XIV.,Together forth they went; Lemnos they left335
11708,BOOK XIV.,"And Imbrus, city of Thrace, and in dark clouds"
11709,BOOK XIV.,"Mantled, with gliding ease swam through the air"
11710,BOOK XIV.,"To Ida’s mount with rilling waters vein’d,"
11711,BOOK XIV.,Parent of savage beasts; at Lectos[7] first
11712,BOOK XIV.,"They quitted Ocean, overpassing high340"
11713,BOOK XIV.,"The dry land, while beneath their feet the woods"
11714,BOOK XIV.,"Their spiry summits waved. There, unperceived"
11715,BOOK XIV.,"By Jove, Sleep mounted Ida’s loftiest pine"
11716,BOOK XIV.,"Of growth that pierced the sky, and hidden sat"
11717,BOOK XIV.,"Secure by its expanded boughs, the bird345"
11718,BOOK XIV.,"Shrill-voiced resembling in the mountains seen,[8]"
11719,BOOK XIV.,"Chalcis in heaven, on earth Cymindis named."
11720,BOOK XIV.,But Juno swift to Gargarus the top
11721,BOOK XIV.,"Of Ida, soar’d, and there Jove saw his spouse."
11722,BOOK XIV.,—Saw her—and in his breast the same love felt350
11723,BOOK XIV.,"Rekindled vehement, which had of old"
11724,BOOK XIV.,"Join’d them, when, by their parents unperceived,"
11725,BOOK XIV.,"They stole aside, and snatch’d their first embrace."
11726,BOOK XIV.,"Soon he accosted her, and thus inquired."
11727,BOOK XIV.,
11728,BOOK XIV.,Juno! what region seeking hast thou left355
11729,BOOK XIV.,"The Olympian summit, and hast here arrived"
11730,BOOK XIV.,With neither steed nor chariot in thy train?
11731,BOOK XIV.,To whom majestic Juno thus replied
11732,BOOK XIV.,"Dissembling. To the green earth’s end I go,"
11733,BOOK XIV.,To visit there the parent of the Gods360
11734,BOOK XIV.,"Oceanus, and Tethys his espoused,"
11735,BOOK XIV.,Mother of all. They kindly from the hands
11736,BOOK XIV.,"Of Rhea took, and with parental care"
11737,BOOK XIV.,Sustain’d and cherish’d me;[9] to them I haste
11738,BOOK XIV.,"Their feuds innumerable to compose,365"
11739,BOOK XIV.,Who disunited by intestine strife
11740,BOOK XIV.,"Long time, from conjugal embrace abstain."
11741,BOOK XIV.,"My steeds, that lightly over dank and dry"
11742,BOOK XIV.,"Shall bear me, at the rooted base I left"
11743,BOOK XIV.,Of Ida river-vein’d. But for thy sake370
11744,BOOK XIV.,"From the Olympian summit I arrive,"
11745,BOOK XIV.,Lest journeying remote to the abode
11746,BOOK XIV.,"Of Ocean, and with no consent of thine"
11747,BOOK XIV.,"Entreated first, I should, perchance, offend."
11748,BOOK XIV.,To whom the cloud-assembler God replied.375
11749,BOOK XIV.,Juno! thy journey thither may be made
11750,BOOK XIV.,Hereafter. Let us turn to dalliance now.
11751,BOOK XIV.,"For never Goddess pour’d, nor woman yet"
11752,BOOK XIV.,So full a tide of love into my breast;
11753,BOOK XIV.,I never loved Ixion’s consort thus380
11754,BOOK XIV.,"Who bore Pirithoüs, wise as we in heaven;"
11755,BOOK XIV.,"Nor sweet Acrisian Danäe, from whom"
11756,BOOK XIV.,"Sprang Perseus, noblest of the race of man;"
11757,BOOK XIV.,"Nor Phœnix’ daughter fair,[10] of whom were born"
11758,BOOK XIV.,"Minos unmatch’d but by the powers above,385"
11759,BOOK XIV.,"And Rhadamanthus; nor yet Semele,"
11760,BOOK XIV.,"Nor yet Alcmena, who in Thebes produced"
11761,BOOK XIV.,The valiant Hercules; and though my son
11762,BOOK XIV.,"By Semele were Bacchus, joy of man;"
11763,BOOK XIV.,"Nor Ceres golden-hair’d, nor high-enthroned390"
11764,BOOK XIV.,"Latona in the skies, no—nor thyself"
11765,BOOK XIV.,"As now I love thee, and my soul perceive"
11766,BOOK XIV.,O’erwhelm’d with sweetness of intense desire.
11767,BOOK XIV.,Then thus majestic Juno her reply
11768,BOOK XIV.,Framed artful. Oh unreasonable haste!395
11769,BOOK XIV.,What speaks the Thunderer? If on Ida’s heights.
11770,BOOK XIV.,Where all is open and to view exposed
11771,BOOK XIV.,"Thou wilt that we embrace, what must betide,"
11772,BOOK XIV.,Should any of the everlasting Gods
11773,BOOK XIV.,"Observe us, and declare it to the rest?400"
11774,BOOK XIV.,"Never could I, arising, seek again,"
11775,BOOK XIV.,"Thy mansion, so unseemly were the deed."
11776,BOOK XIV.,"But if thy inclinations that way tend,"
11777,BOOK XIV.,"Thou hast a chamber; it is Vulcan’s work,"
11778,BOOK XIV.,Our son’s; he framed and fitted to its posts405
11779,BOOK XIV.,"The solid portal; thither let us his,"
11780,BOOK XIV.,"And there repose, since such thy pleasure seems."
11781,BOOK XIV.,To whom the cloud-assembler Deity.
11782,BOOK XIV.,"Fear thou not, Juno, lest the eye of man"
11783,BOOK XIV.,Or of a God discern us; at my word410
11784,BOOK XIV.,"A golden cloud shall fold us so around,"
11785,BOOK XIV.,That not the Sun himself shall through that veil
11786,BOOK XIV.,"Discover aught, though keenest-eyed of all."
11787,BOOK XIV.,"So spake the son of Saturn, and his spouse"
11788,BOOK XIV.,Fast lock’d within his arms. Beneath them earth415
11789,BOOK XIV.,With sudden herbage teem’d; at once upsprang
11790,BOOK XIV.,"The crocus soft, the lotus bathed in dew,"
11791,BOOK XIV.,And the crisp hyacinth with clustering bells;
11792,BOOK XIV.,"Thick was their growth, and high above the ground"
11793,BOOK XIV.,"Upbore them. On that flowery couch they lay,420"
11794,BOOK XIV.,Invested with a golden cloud that shed
11795,BOOK XIV.,"Bright dew-drops all around.[11] His heart at ease,"
11796,BOOK XIV.,"There lay the Sire of all, by Sleep and Love"
11797,BOOK XIV.,"Vanquish’d on lofty Gargarus, his spouse"
11798,BOOK XIV.,Constraining still with amorous embrace.425
11799,BOOK XIV.,"Then, gentle Sleep to the Achaian camp"
11800,BOOK XIV.,"Sped swift away, with tidings for the ear"
11801,BOOK XIV.,Of earth-encircler Neptune charged; him soon
11802,BOOK XIV.,"He found, and in wing’d accents thus began."
11803,BOOK XIV.,"Now Neptune, yield the Greeks effectual aid,430"
11804,BOOK XIV.,"And, while the moment lasts of Jove’s repose,"
11805,BOOK XIV.,Make victory theirs; for him in slumbers soft
11806,BOOK XIV.,"I have involved, while Juno by deceit"
11807,BOOK XIV.,"Prevailing, lured him with the bait of love."
11808,BOOK XIV.,"He said, and swift departed to his task435"
11809,BOOK XIV.,Among the nations; but his tidings urged
11810,BOOK XIV.,Neptune with still more ardor to assist
11811,BOOK XIV.,The Danaï; he leap’d into the van
11812,BOOK XIV.,"Afar, and thus exhorted them aloud."
11813,BOOK XIV.,Oh Argives! yield we yet again the day440
11814,BOOK XIV.,To Priameian Hector? Shall he seize
11815,BOOK XIV.,"Our ships, and make the glory all his own?"
11816,BOOK XIV.,"Such is his expectation, so he vaunts,"
11817,BOOK XIV.,"For that Achilles leaves not yet his camp,"
11818,BOOK XIV.,"Resentful; but of him small need, I judge,445"
11819,BOOK XIV.,"Should here be felt, could once the rest be roused"
11820,BOOK XIV.,"To mutual aid. Act, then, as I advise."
11821,BOOK XIV.,"The best and broadest bucklers of the host,"
11822,BOOK XIV.,"And brightest helmets put we on, and arm’d"
11823,BOOK XIV.,"With longest spears, advance; myself will lead;450"
11824,BOOK XIV.,"And trust me, furious though he be, the son"
11825,BOOK XIV.,Of Priam flies. Ye then who feel your hearts
11826,BOOK XIV.,"Undaunted, but are arm’d with smaller shields,"
11827,BOOK XIV.,"Them give to those who fear, and in exchange"
11828,BOOK XIV.,Their stronger shields and broader take yourselves.455
11829,BOOK XIV.,"So he, whom, unreluctant, all obey’d."
11830,BOOK XIV.,"Then, wounded as they were, themselves the Kings,"
11831,BOOK XIV.,"Tydides, Agamemnon and Ulysses"
11832,BOOK XIV.,"Marshall’d the warriors, and from rank to rank"
11833,BOOK XIV.,"Made just exchange of arms, giving the best460"
11834,BOOK XIV.,"To the best warriors, to the worse, the worst."
11835,BOOK XIV.,And now in brazen armor all array’d
11836,BOOK XIV.,"Refulgent on they moved, by Neptune led"
11837,BOOK XIV.,With firm hand grasping his long-bladed sword
11838,BOOK XIV.,Keen as Jove’s bolt; with him may none contend465
11839,BOOK XIV.,In dreadful fight; but fear chains every arm.
11840,BOOK XIV.,"Opposite, Priameian Hector ranged"
11841,BOOK XIV.,His Trojans; then they stretch’d the bloody cord
11842,BOOK XIV.,"Of conflict tight, Neptune cœrulean-hair’d,"
11843,BOOK XIV.,"And Hector, pride of Ilium; one, the Greeks470"
11844,BOOK XIV.,"Supporting firm, and one, the powers of Troy;"
11845,BOOK XIV.,"A sea-flood dash’d the galleys, and the hosts"
11846,BOOK XIV.,Join’d clamorous. Not so the billows roar
11847,BOOK XIV.,"The shores among, when Boreas’ roughest blast"
11848,BOOK XIV.,Sweeps landward from the main the towering surge;475
11849,BOOK XIV.,"Not so, devouring fire among the trees"
11850,BOOK XIV.,"That clothe the mountain, when the sheeted flames"
11851,BOOK XIV.,Ascending wrap the forest in a blaze;
11852,BOOK XIV.,Nor howl the winds through leafy boughs of oaks
11853,BOOK XIV.,Upgrown aloft (though loudest there they rave)480
11854,BOOK XIV.,With sounds so awful as were heard of Greeks
11855,BOOK XIV.,And Trojans shouting when the clash began.
11856,BOOK XIV.,"At Ajax, first (for face to face they stood)"
11857,BOOK XIV.,"Illustrious Hector threw a spear well-aim’d,"
11858,BOOK XIV.,But smote him where the belts that bore his shield485
11859,BOOK XIV.,And falchion cross’d each other on his breast.
11860,BOOK XIV.,The double guard preserved him unannoy’d.
11861,BOOK XIV.,"Indignant that his spear had bootless flown,"
11862,BOOK XIV.,"Yet fearing death at hand, the Trojan Chief"
11863,BOOK XIV.,Toward the phalanx of his friends retired.490
11864,BOOK XIV.,"But, as he went, huge Ajax with a stone"
11865,BOOK XIV.,Of those which propp’d the ships (for numerous such
11866,BOOK XIV.,Lay rolling at the feet of those who fought)
11867,BOOK XIV.,Assail’d him. Twirling like a top it pass’d
11868,BOOK XIV.,"The shield of Hector, near the neck his breast495"
11869,BOOK XIV.,"Struck full, then plough’d circuitous the dust."
11870,BOOK XIV.,As when Jove’s arm omnipotent an oak
11871,BOOK XIV.,"Prostrates uprooted on the plain, a fume"
11872,BOOK XIV.,"Rises sulphureous from the riven trunk,"
11873,BOOK XIV.,"And if, perchance, some traveller nigh at hand500"
11874,BOOK XIV.,"See it, he trembles at the bolt of Jove,"
11875,BOOK XIV.,"So fell the might of Hector, to the earth"
11876,BOOK XIV.,"Smitten at once. Down dropp’d his idle spear,"
11877,BOOK XIV.,And with his helmet and his shield himself
11878,BOOK XIV.,Also; loud thunder’d all his gorgeous arms.505
11879,BOOK XIV.,"Swift flew the Grecians shouting to the skies,"
11880,BOOK XIV.,"And showering darts, to drag his body thence,"
11881,BOOK XIV.,But neither spear of theirs nor shaft could harm
11882,BOOK XIV.,"The fallen leader, with such instant aid"
11883,BOOK XIV.,"His princely friends encircled him around,510"
11884,BOOK XIV.,"Sarpedon, Lycian Chief, Glaucus the brave,"
11885,BOOK XIV.,"Polydamas, Æneas, and renown’d"
11886,BOOK XIV.,"Agenor; neither tardy were the rest,"
11887,BOOK XIV.,But with round shields all shelter’d Hector fallen.
11888,BOOK XIV.,Him soon uplifted from the plain his friends515
11889,BOOK XIV.,"Bore thence, till where his fiery coursers stood,"
11890,BOOK XIV.,"And splendid chariot in the rear, they came,"
11891,BOOK XIV.,Then Troy-ward drove him groaning as he went.
11892,BOOK XIV.,Ere long arriving at the pleasant stream
11893,BOOK XIV.,"Of eddied Xanthus, progeny of Jove,520"
11894,BOOK XIV.,"They laid him on the bank, and on his face"
11895,BOOK XIV.,"Pour’d water; he, reviving, upward gazed,"
11896,BOOK XIV.,And seated on his hams black blood disgorged
11897,BOOK XIV.,"Coagulate, but soon relapsing, fell"
11898,BOOK XIV.,"Supine, his eyes with pitchy darkness veil’d,525"
11899,BOOK XIV.,And all his powers still torpid by the blow.
11900,BOOK XIV.,"Then, seeing Hector borne away, the Greeks"
11901,BOOK XIV.,"Rush’d fiercer on, all mindful of the fight,"
11902,BOOK XIV.,"And far before the rest, Ajax the swift,"
11903,BOOK XIV.,"The Oïlean Chief, with pointed spear530"
11904,BOOK XIV.,"On Satnius springing, pierced him. Him a nymph"
11905,BOOK XIV.,"A Naiad, bore to Enops, while his herd"
11906,BOOK XIV.,"Feeding, on Satnio’s grassy verge he stray’d."
11907,BOOK XIV.,But Oïliades the spear-renown’d
11908,BOOK XIV.,"Approaching, pierced his flank; supine he fell,535"
11909,BOOK XIV.,And fiery contest for the dead arose.
11910,BOOK XIV.,"In vengeance of his fall, spear-shaking Chief"
11911,BOOK XIV.,The son of Panthus into fight advanced
11912,BOOK XIV.,"Polydamas, who Prothöenor pierced"
11913,BOOK XIV.,"Offspring of Areïlocus, and urged540"
11914,BOOK XIV.,Through his right shoulder sheer the stormy lance.
11915,BOOK XIV.,"He, prostrate, clench’d the dust, and with loud voice"
11916,BOOK XIV.,Polydamas exulted at his fall.
11917,BOOK XIV.,"Yon spear, methinks, hurl’d from the warlike hand"
11918,BOOK XIV.,"Of Panthus’ noble son, flew not in vain,545"
11919,BOOK XIV.,"But some Greek hath it, purposing, I judge,"
11920,BOOK XIV.,To lean on it in his descent to hell.
11921,BOOK XIV.,"So he, whose vaunt the Greeks indignant heard."
11922,BOOK XIV.,"But most indignant, Ajax, offspring bold"
11923,BOOK XIV.,"Of Telamon, to whom he nearest fell.550"
11924,BOOK XIV.,"He, quick, at the retiring conqueror cast"
11925,BOOK XIV.,His radiant spear; Polydamas the stroke
11926,BOOK XIV.,"Shunn’d, starting sideward; but Antenor’s son"
11927,BOOK XIV.,"Archilochus the mortal dint received,"
11928,BOOK XIV.,Death-destined by the Gods; where neck and spine555
11929,BOOK XIV.,"Unite, both tendons he dissever’d wide,"
11930,BOOK XIV.,"And, ere his knees, his nostrils met the ground."
11931,BOOK XIV.,Then Ajax in his turn vaunting aloud
11932,BOOK XIV.,"Against renown’d Polydamas, exclaim’d."
11933,BOOK XIV.,"Speak now the truth, Polydamas, and weigh560"
11934,BOOK XIV.,My question well. His life whom I have slain
11935,BOOK XIV.,Makes it not compensation for the loss
11936,BOOK XIV.,Of Prothöenor’s life! To me he seems
11937,BOOK XIV.,"Nor base himself; nor yet of base descent,"
11938,BOOK XIV.,"But brother of Atenor steed-renown’d,565"
11939,BOOK XIV.,Or else perchance his son; for in my eyes
11940,BOOK XIV.,Antenor’s lineage he resembles most.
11941,BOOK XIV.,"So he, well knowing him, and sorrow seized"
11942,BOOK XIV.,Each Trojan heart. Then Acamas around
11943,BOOK XIV.,"His brother stalking, wounded with his spear570"
11944,BOOK XIV.,"Bœotian Promachus, who by the feet"
11945,BOOK XIV.,Dragg’d off the slain. Acamas in his fall
11946,BOOK XIV.,Aloud exulted with a boundless joy.
11947,BOOK XIV.,"Vain-glorious Argives, archers inexpert!"
11948,BOOK XIV.,"War’s toil and trouble are not ours alone,575"
11949,BOOK XIV.,But ye shall perish also; mark the man—
11950,BOOK XIV.,"How sound he sleeps tamed by my conquering arm,"
11951,BOOK XIV.,Your fellow-warrior Promachus! the debt
11952,BOOK XIV.,Of vengeance on my brother’s dear behalf
11953,BOOK XIV.,Demanded quick discharge; well may the wish580
11954,BOOK XIV.,Of every dying warrior be to leave
11955,BOOK XIV.,A brother living to avenge his fall.
11956,BOOK XIV.,"He ended, whom the Greeks indignant heard,"
11957,BOOK XIV.,But chiefly brave Peneleus; swift he rush’d
11958,BOOK XIV.,On Acamas; but from before the force585
11959,BOOK XIV.,"Of King Peneleus Acamas retired,"
11960,BOOK XIV.,"And, in his stead, Ilioneus he pierced,"
11961,BOOK XIV.,"Offspring of Phorbas, rich in flocks; and blest"
11962,BOOK XIV.,By Mercury with such abundant wealth
11963,BOOK XIV.,"As other Trojan none, nor child to him590"
11964,BOOK XIV.,"His spouse had borne, Ilioneus except."
11965,BOOK XIV.,Him close beneath the brow to his eye-roots
11966,BOOK XIV.,"Piercing, he push’d the pupil from its seat,"
11967,BOOK XIV.,And through his eye and through his poll the spear
11968,BOOK XIV.,Urged furious. He down-sitting on the earth595
11969,BOOK XIV.,"Both hands extended; but, his glittering blade"
11970,BOOK XIV.,"Forth-drawn, Peneleus through his middle neck"
11971,BOOK XIV.,Enforced it; head and helmet to the ground
11972,BOOK XIV.,"He lopp’d together, with the lance infixt"
11973,BOOK XIV.,Still in his eye; then like a poppy’s head600
11974,BOOK XIV.,"The crimson trophy lifting, in the ears"
11975,BOOK XIV.,"He vaunted loud of Ilium’s host, and cried."
11976,BOOK XIV.,"Go, Trojans! be my messengers! Inform"
11977,BOOK XIV.,The parents of Ilioneus the brave
11978,BOOK XIV.,"That they may mourn their son through all their house,605"
11979,BOOK XIV.,For so the wife of Alegenor’s son
11980,BOOK XIV.,"Bœotian Promachus must him bewail,"
11981,BOOK XIV.,Nor shall she welcome his return with smiles
11982,BOOK XIV.,"Of joy affectionate, when from the shores"
11983,BOOK XIV.,Of Troy the fleet shall bear us Grecians home.610
11984,BOOK XIV.,"He said; fear whiten’d every Trojan cheek,"
11985,BOOK XIV.,And every Trojan eye with earnest look
11986,BOOK XIV.,Inquired a refuge from impending fate.
11987,BOOK XIV.,"Say now, ye Muses, blest inhabitants"
11988,BOOK XIV.,Of the Olympian realms! what Grecian first615
11989,BOOK XIV.,Fill’d his victorious hand with armor stript
11990,BOOK XIV.,"From slaughter’d Trojans, after Ocean’s God"
11991,BOOK XIV.,"Had, interposing, changed the battle’s course?"
11992,BOOK XIV.,"First, Telamonian Ajax Hyrtius slew,"
11993,BOOK XIV.,Undaunted leader of the Mysian band.620
11994,BOOK XIV.,Phalces and Mermerus their arms resign’d
11995,BOOK XIV.,To young Antilochus; Hyppotion fell
11996,BOOK XIV.,And Morys by Meriones; the shafts
11997,BOOK XIV.,Right-aim’d of Teucer to the shades dismiss’d
11998,BOOK XIV.,"Prothöus and Periphetes, and the prince625"

12025,BOOK XV.,But when the flying Trojans had o’erpass’d
12026,BOOK XV.,"Both stakes and trench, and numerous slaughtered lay"
12027,BOOK XV.,"By Grecian hands, the remnant halted all"
12028,BOOK XV.,"Beside their chariots, pale, discomfited."
12029,BOOK XV.,Then was it that on Ida’s summit Jove5
12030,BOOK XV.,"At Juno’s side awoke; starting, he stood"
12031,BOOK XV.,"At once erect; Trojans and Greeks he saw,"
12032,BOOK XV.,"These broken, those pursuing and led on"
12033,BOOK XV.,By Neptune; he beheld also remote
12034,BOOK XV.,"Encircled by his friends, and on the plain10"
12035,BOOK XV.,"Extended, Hector; there he panting lay,"
12036,BOOK XV.,"Senseless, ejecting blood, bruised by a blow"
12037,BOOK XV.,From not the feeblest of the sons of Greece.
12038,BOOK XV.,"Touch’d with compassion at that sight, the Sire"
12039,BOOK XV.,"Of Gods and men, frowning terrific, fix’d15"
12040,BOOK XV.,"His eyes on Juno, and her thus bespake."
12041,BOOK XV.,"No place for doubt remains. Oh, versed in wiles,"
12042,BOOK XV.,Juno! thy mischief-teeming mind perverse
12043,BOOK XV.,Hath plotted this; thou hast contrived the hurt
12044,BOOK XV.,"Of Hector, and hast driven his host to flight.20"
12045,BOOK XV.,I know not but thyself mayst chance to reap
12046,BOOK XV.,"The first-fruits of thy cunning, scourged[1] by me."
12047,BOOK XV.,Hast thou forgotten how I once aloft
12048,BOOK XV.,"Suspended thee, with anvils at thy feet,"
12049,BOOK XV.,And both thy wrists bound with a golden cord25
12050,BOOK XV.,Indissoluble? In the clouds of heaven
12051,BOOK XV.,"I hung thee, while from the Olympian heights"
12052,BOOK XV.,"The Gods look’d mournful on, but of them all"
12053,BOOK XV.,"None could deliver thee, for whom I seized,"
12054,BOOK XV.,"Hurl’d through the gates of heaven on earth he fell,30"
12055,BOOK XV.,Half-breathless. Neither so did I resign
12056,BOOK XV.,My hot resentment of the hero’s wrongs
12057,BOOK XV.,"Immortal Hercules, whom thou by storms"
12058,BOOK XV.,"Call’d from the North, with mischievous intent"
12059,BOOK XV.,Hadst driven far distant o’er the barren Deep35
12060,BOOK XV.,"To populous Cos. Thence I deliver’d him,"
12061,BOOK XV.,"And after numerous woes severe, he reach’d"
12062,BOOK XV.,"The shores of fruitful Argos, saved by me."
12063,BOOK XV.,"I thus remind thee now, that thou mayst cease"
12064,BOOK XV.,"Henceforth from artifice, and mayst be taught40"
12065,BOOK XV.,How little all the dalliance and the love
12066,BOOK XV.,"Which, stealing down from heaven, thou hast by fraud"
12067,BOOK XV.,"Obtain’d from me, shall profit thee at last."
12068,BOOK XV.,"He ended, whom imperial Juno heard"
12069,BOOK XV.,"Shuddering, and in wing’d accents thus replied.45"
12070,BOOK XV.,"Be witness Earth, the boundless Heaven above,"
12071,BOOK XV.,"And Styx beneath, whose stream the blessed Gods"
12072,BOOK XV.,Even tremble to adjure;[2] be witness too
12073,BOOK XV.,"Thy sacred life, and our connubial bed,"
12074,BOOK XV.,"Which by a false oath I will never wrong,50"
12075,BOOK XV.,That by no art induced or plot of mine
12076,BOOK XV.,"Neptune, the Shaker of the shores, inflicts"
12077,BOOK XV.,These harms on Hector and the Trojan host
12078,BOOK XV.,"Aiding the Grecians, but impell’d alone"
12079,BOOK XV.,By his own heart with pity moved at sight55
12080,BOOK XV.,Of the Achaians at the ships subdued.
12081,BOOK XV.,"But even him, oh Sovereign of the storms!"
12082,BOOK XV.,I am prepared to admonish that he quit
12083,BOOK XV.,"The battle, and retire where thou command’st."
12084,BOOK XV.,"So she; then smiled the Sire of Gods and men,60"
12085,BOOK XV.,And in wing’d accents answer thus return’d.[3]
12086,BOOK XV.,Juno! wouldst thou on thy celestial throne
12087,BOOK XV.,"Assist my counsels, howso’er in heart"
12088,BOOK XV.,"He differ now, Neptune should soon his will"
12089,BOOK XV.,Submissive bend to thy desires and mine.65
12090,BOOK XV.,But if sincerity be in thy words
12091,BOOK XV.,"And truth, repairing to the blest abodes"
12092,BOOK XV.,"Send Iris hither, with the archer God"
12093,BOOK XV.,"Apollo; that she, visiting the host"
12094,BOOK XV.,"Of Greece, may bid the Sovereign of the Deep70"
12095,BOOK XV.,"Renounce the fight, and seek his proper home."
12096,BOOK XV.,Apollo’s part shall be to rouse again
12097,BOOK XV.,"Hector to battle, to inspire his soul"
12098,BOOK XV.,"Afresh with courage, and all memory thence"
12099,BOOK XV.,To banish of the pangs which now he feels.75
12100,BOOK XV.,Apollo also shall again repulse
12101,BOOK XV.,"Achaia’s host, which with base panic fill’d,"
12102,BOOK XV.,Shall even to Achilles’ ships be driven.
12103,BOOK XV.,Achilles shall his valiant friend exhort
12104,BOOK XV.,Patroclus forth; him under Ilium’s walls80
12105,BOOK XV.,Shall glorious Hector slay; but many a youth
12106,BOOK XV.,"Shall perish by Patroclus first, with whom,"
12107,BOOK XV.,"My noble son Sarpedon. Peleus’ son,"
12108,BOOK XV.,"Resentful of Patroclus’ death, shall slay"
12109,BOOK XV.,"Hector, and I will urge ceaseless, myself,85"
12110,BOOK XV.,"Thenceforth the routed Trojans back again,"
12111,BOOK XV.,Till by Minerva’s aid the Greeks shall take
12112,BOOK XV.,Ilium’s proud city; till that day arrive
12113,BOOK XV.,"My wrath shall burn, nor will I one permit"
12114,BOOK XV.,"Of all the Immortals to assist the Greeks,90"
12115,BOOK XV.,But will perform Achilles’ whole desire.
12116,BOOK XV.,"Such was my promise to him at the first,"
12117,BOOK XV.,Ratified by a nod that self-same day
12118,BOOK XV.,"When Thetis clasp’d my knees, begging revenge"
12119,BOOK XV.,And glory for her city-spoiler son.95
12120,BOOK XV.,He ended; nor his spouse white-arm’d refused
12121,BOOK XV.,"Obedience, but from the Idæan heights"
12122,BOOK XV.,"Departing, to the Olympian summit soar’d."
12123,BOOK XV.,"Swift as the traveller’s thought,[4] who, many a land"
12124,BOOK XV.,"Traversed, deliberates on his future course100"
12125,BOOK XV.,"Uncertain, and his mind sends every way,"
12126,BOOK XV.,So swift updarted Juno to the skies.
12127,BOOK XV.,"Arrived on the Olympian heights, she found"
12128,BOOK XV.,"The Gods assembled; they, at once, their seats"
12129,BOOK XV.,"At her approach forsaking, with full cups105"
12130,BOOK XV.,"Her coming hail’d; heedless of all beside,"
12131,BOOK XV.,"She took the cup from blooming Themis’ hand,"
12132,BOOK XV.,"For she first flew to welcome her, and thus"
12133,BOOK XV.,In accents wing’d of her return inquired.
12134,BOOK XV.,"Say, Juno, why this sudden re-ascent?110"
12135,BOOK XV.,"Thou seem’st dismay’d; hath Saturn’s son, thy spouse,"
12136,BOOK XV.,Driven thee affrighted to the skies again?
12137,BOOK XV.,To whom the white-arm’d Goddess thus replied.
12138,BOOK XV.,"Themis divine, ask not. Full well thou know’st"
12139,BOOK XV.,"How harshly temper’d is the mind of Jove,115"
12140,BOOK XV.,And how untractable. Resume thy seat;
12141,BOOK XV.,"The banquet calls thee; at our board preside,"
12142,BOOK XV.,"Thou shalt be told, and all in heaven shall hear"
12143,BOOK XV.,What ills he threatens; such as shall not leave
12144,BOOK XV.,"All minds at ease, I judge, here or on earth,120"
12145,BOOK XV.,However tranquil some and joyous now.
12146,BOOK XV.,"So spake the awful spouse of Jove, and sat."
12147,BOOK XV.,"Then, all alike, the Gods displeasure felt"
12148,BOOK XV.,"Throughout the courts of Jove, but she, her lips"
12149,BOOK XV.,Gracing with smiles from which her sable brows125
12150,BOOK XV.,"Dissented,[5] thus indignant them address’d."
12151,BOOK XV.,Alas! how vain against the Thunderer’s will
12152,BOOK XV.,"Our anger, and the hope to supersede"
12153,BOOK XV.,"His purpose, by persuasion or by force!"
12154,BOOK XV.,"He solitary sits, all unconcern’d130"
12155,BOOK XV.,"At our resentment, and himself proclaims"
12156,BOOK XV.,Mightiest and most to be revered in heaven.
12157,BOOK XV.,"Be patient, therefore, and let each endure"
12158,BOOK XV.,"Such ills as Jove may send him. Mars, I ween,"
12159,BOOK XV.,Already hath his share; the warrior God135
12160,BOOK XV.,"Hath lost Ascalaphus, of all mankind"
12161,BOOK XV.,"His most beloved, and whom he calls his own."
12162,BOOK XV.,"She spake, and with expanded palms his thighs"
12163,BOOK XV.,"Smiling, thus, sorrowful, the God exclaim’d."
12164,BOOK XV.,Inhabitants of the Olympian heights!140
12165,BOOK XV.,"Oh bear with me, if to avenge my son"
12166,BOOK XV.,"I seek Achaia’s fleet, although my doom"
12167,BOOK XV.,"Be thunder-bolts from Jove, and with the dead"
12168,BOOK XV.,Outstretch’d to lie in carnage and in dust.
12169,BOOK XV.,"He spake, and bidding Horror and Dismay145"
12170,BOOK XV.,"Lead to the yoke his rapid steeds, put on"
12171,BOOK XV.,His all-refulgent armor. Then had wrath
12172,BOOK XV.,"More dreadful, some strange vengeance on the Gods"
12173,BOOK XV.,"From Jove befallen, had not Minerva, touch’d"
12174,BOOK XV.,"With timely fears for all, upstarting sprung150"
12175,BOOK XV.,"From where she sat, right through the vestibule."
12176,BOOK XV.,"She snatch’d the helmet from his brows, the shield"
12177,BOOK XV.,"From his broad shoulder, and the brazen spear"
12178,BOOK XV.,Forced from his grasp into its place restored.
12179,BOOK XV.,"Then reprimanding Mars, she thus began.155"
12180,BOOK XV.,"Frantic, delirious! thou art lost for ever!"
12181,BOOK XV.,"Is it in vain that thou hast ears to hear,"
12182,BOOK XV.,And hast thou neither shame nor reason left?
12183,BOOK XV.,How? hear’st thou not the Goddess? the report
12184,BOOK XV.,Of white-arm’d Juno from Olympian Jove160
12185,BOOK XV.,"Return’d this moment? or perfer’st thou rather,"
12186,BOOK XV.,"Plagued with a thousand woes, and under force"
12187,BOOK XV.,Of sad necessity to seek again
12188,BOOK XV.,"Olympus, and at thy return to prove"
12189,BOOK XV.,Author of countless miseries to us all?165
12190,BOOK XV.,For He at once Grecians and Trojans both
12191,BOOK XV.,"Abandoning, will hither haste prepared"
12192,BOOK XV.,"To tempest[6] us in heaven, whom he will seize,"
12193,BOOK XV.,"The guilty and the guiltless, all alike."
12194,BOOK XV.,"I bid thee, therefore, patient bear the death170"
12195,BOOK XV.,Of thy Ascalaphus; braver than he
12196,BOOK XV.,"And abler have, ere now, in battle fallen,"
12197,BOOK XV.,And shall hereafter; arduous were the task
12198,BOOK XV.,To rescue from the stroke of fate the race
12199,BOOK XV.,"Of mortal men, with all their progeny.175"
12200,BOOK XV.,"So saying, Minerva on his throne replaced"
12201,BOOK XV.,"The fiery Mars. Then, summoning abroad"
12202,BOOK XV.,"Apollo from within the hall of Jove,"
12203,BOOK XV.,"With Iris, swift ambassadress of heaven,"
12204,BOOK XV.,Them in wing’d accents Juno thus bespake.180
12205,BOOK XV.,Jove bids you hence with undelaying speed
12206,BOOK XV.,"To Ida; in his presence once arrived,"
12207,BOOK XV.,See that ye execute his whole command.
12208,BOOK XV.,"So saying, the awful Goddess to her throne"
12209,BOOK XV.,"Return’d and sat. They, cleaving swift the air,185"
12210,BOOK XV.,"Alighted soon on Ida fountain-fed,"
12211,BOOK XV.,Parent of savage kinds. High on the point
12212,BOOK XV.,"Seated of Gargarus, and wrapt around"
12213,BOOK XV.,"With fragrant clouds, they found Saturnian Jove"
12214,BOOK XV.,"The Thunderer, and in his presence stood.190"
12215,BOOK XV.,"He, nought displeased that they his high command"
12216,BOOK XV.,"Had with such readiness obey’d, his speech"
12217,BOOK XV.,"To Iris, first, in accents wing’d address’d"
12218,BOOK XV.,"Swift Iris, haste—to royal Neptune bear"
12219,BOOK XV.,My charge entire; falsify not the word.195
12220,BOOK XV.,"Bid him, relinquishing the fight, withdraw"
12221,BOOK XV.,"Either to heaven, or to the boundless Deep."
12222,BOOK XV.,"But should he disobedient prove, and scorn"
12223,BOOK XV.,"My message, let him, next, consider well"
12224,BOOK XV.,"How he will bear, powerful as he is,200"
12225,BOOK XV.,My coming. Me I boast superior far
12226,BOOK XV.,"In force, and elder-born; yet deems he slight"
12227,BOOK XV.,"The danger of comparison with me,"
12228,BOOK XV.,Who am the terror of all heaven beside.
12229,BOOK XV.,"He spake, nor storm-wing’d Iris disobey’d,205"
12230,BOOK XV.,But down from the Idæan summit stoop’d
12231,BOOK XV.,To sacred Ilium. As when snow or hail
12232,BOOK XV.,"Flies drifted by the cloud-dispelling North,"
12233,BOOK XV.,"So swiftly, wing’d with readiness of will,"
12234,BOOK XV.,"She shot the gulf between, and standing soon210"
12235,BOOK XV.,"At glorious Neptune’s side, him thus address’d."
12236,BOOK XV.,"To thee, O Neptune azure-hair’d! I come"
12237,BOOK XV.,With tidings charged from Ægis-bearing Jove.
12238,BOOK XV.,"He bids thee cease from battle, and retire"
12239,BOOK XV.,"Either to heaven, or to the boundless Deep.215"
12240,BOOK XV.,"But shouldst thou, disobedient, set at nought"
12241,BOOK XV.,"His words, he threatens that himself will haste"
12242,BOOK XV.,To fight against thee; but he bids thee shun
12243,BOOK XV.,"That strife with one superior far to thee,"
12244,BOOK XV.,"And elder-born; yet deem’st thou slight, he saith,220"
12245,BOOK XV.,"The danger of comparison with Him,"
12246,BOOK XV.,Although the terror of all heaven beside.
12247,BOOK XV.,Her then the mighty Shaker of the shores
12248,BOOK XV.,"Answer’d indignant. Great as is his power,"
12249,BOOK XV.,"Yet he hath spoken proudly, threatening me225"
12250,BOOK XV.,"With force, high-born and glorious as himself."
12251,BOOK XV.,"We are three brothers; Saturn is our sire,"
12252,BOOK XV.,"And Rhea brought us forth; first, Jove she bore;"
12253,BOOK XV.,"Me next; then, Pluto, Sovereign of the shades."
12254,BOOK XV.,By distribution tripart we received230
12255,BOOK XV.,Each his peculiar honors; me the lots
12256,BOOK XV.,"Made Ruler of the hoary floods, and there"
12257,BOOK XV.,"I dwell for ever. Pluto, for his part,"
12258,BOOK XV.,"The regions took of darkness; and the heavens,"
12259,BOOK XV.,"The clouds, and boundless æther, fell to Jove.235"
12260,BOOK XV.,The Earth and the Olympian heights alike
12261,BOOK XV.,Are common to the three. My life and being
12262,BOOK XV.,"I hold not, therefore, at his will, whose best"
12263,BOOK XV.,"And safest course, with all his boasted power,"
12264,BOOK XV.,Were to possess in peace his proper third.240
12265,BOOK XV.,Let him not seek to terrify with force
12266,BOOK XV.,Me like a dastard; let him rather chide
12267,BOOK XV.,His own-begotten; with big-sounding words
12268,BOOK XV.,"His sons and daughters govern, who perforce"
12269,BOOK XV.,"Obey his voice, and shrink at his commands.245"
12270,BOOK XV.,"To whom thus Iris tempest-wing’d replied,"
12271,BOOK XV.,Cœrulean-tress’d Sovereign of the Deep!
12272,BOOK XV.,"Shall I report to Jove, harsh as it is,"
12273,BOOK XV.,"Thy speech, or wilt thou soften it? The wise"
12274,BOOK XV.,"Are flexible, and on the elder-born250"
12275,BOOK XV.,"Erynnis, with her vengeful sisters, waits.[7]"
12276,BOOK XV.,Her answer’d then the Shaker of the shores.
12277,BOOK XV.,"Prudent is thy advice, Iris divine!"
12278,BOOK XV.,Discretion in a messenger is good
12279,BOOK XV.,"At all times. But the cause that fires me thus,255"
12280,BOOK XV.,And with resentment my whole heart and mind
12281,BOOK XV.,"Possesses, is the license that he claims"
12282,BOOK XV.,To vex with provocation rude of speech
12283,BOOK XV.,"Me his compeer, and by decree of Fate"
12284,BOOK XV.,"Illustrious as himself; yet, though incensed,260"
12285,BOOK XV.,"And with just cause, I will not now persist."
12286,BOOK XV.,But hear—for it is treasured in my heart
12287,BOOK XV.,The threat that my lips utter. If he still
12288,BOOK XV.,Resolve to spare proud Ilium in despite
12289,BOOK XV.,"Of me, of Pallas, Goddess of the spoils,265"
12290,BOOK XV.,"Of Juno, Mercury, and the King of fire,"
12291,BOOK XV.,"And will not overturn her lofty towers,"
12292,BOOK XV.,"Nor grant immortal glory to the Greeks,"
12293,BOOK XV.,"Then tell him thus—hostility shall burn,"
12294,BOOK XV.,And wrath between us never to be quench’d.270
12295,BOOK XV.,"So saying, the Shaker of the shores forsook"
12296,BOOK XV.,"The Grecian host, and plunged into the deep,"
12297,BOOK XV.,"Miss’d by Achaia’s heroes. Then, the cloud-Assembler"
12298,BOOK XV.,God thus to Apollo spake.
12299,BOOK XV.,"Hence, my Apollo! to the Trojan Chief275"
12300,BOOK XV.,"Hector; for earth-encircler Neptune, awed"
12301,BOOK XV.,"By fear of my displeasure imminent,"
12302,BOOK XV.,"Hath sought the sacred Deep. Else, all the Gods"
12303,BOOK XV.,"Who compass Saturn in the nether realms,"
12304,BOOK XV.,"Had even there our contest heard, I ween,280"
12305,BOOK XV.,And heard it loudly. But that he retreats
12306,BOOK XV.,"Although at first incensed, shunning my wrath,"
12307,BOOK XV.,"Is salutary both for him and me,"
12308,BOOK XV.,Whose difference else had not been healed with ease.
12309,BOOK XV.,"Take thou my shaggy Ægis, and with force285"
12310,BOOK XV.,"Smiting it, terrify the Chiefs of Greece."
12311,BOOK XV.,"As for illustrious Hector, him I give"
12312,BOOK XV.,To thy peculiar care; fail not to rouse
12313,BOOK XV.,"His fiercest courage, till he push the Greeks"
12314,BOOK XV.,"To Hellespont, and to their ships again;290"
12315,BOOK XV.,Thenceforth to yield to their afflicted host
12316,BOOK XV.,"Some pause from toil, shall be my own concern."
12317,BOOK XV.,"He ended, nor Apollo disobey’d"
12318,BOOK XV.,"His father’s voice; from the Idæan heights,"
12319,BOOK XV.,"Swift as the swiftest of the fowls of air,295"
12320,BOOK XV.,"The dove-destroyer falcon, down he flew."
12321,BOOK XV.,"The noble Hector, valiant Priam’s son"
12322,BOOK XV.,"He found, not now extended on the plain,"
12323,BOOK XV.,"But seated; newly, as from death, awaked,"
12324,BOOK XV.,And conscious of his friends; freely he breathed300
12325,BOOK XV.,"Nor sweated more, by Jove himself revived."
12326,BOOK XV.,"Apollo stood beside him, and began."
12327,BOOK XV.,"Say, Hector, Priam’s son! why sittest here"
12328,BOOK XV.,"Feeble and spiritless, and from thy host"
12329,BOOK XV.,Apart? what new disaster hath befall’n?305
12330,BOOK XV.,To whom with difficulty thus replied
12331,BOOK XV.,"The warlike Chief.—But tell me who art Thou,"
12332,BOOK XV.,Divine inquirer! best of powers above!
12333,BOOK XV.,Know’st not that dauntless Ajax me his friends
12334,BOOK XV.,"Slaughtering at yonder ships, hath with a stone310"
12335,BOOK XV.,"Surceased from fight, smiting me on the breast?"
12336,BOOK XV.,"I thought to have beheld, this day, the dead"
12337,BOOK XV.,"In Ades, every breath so seem’d my last."
12338,BOOK XV.,Then answer thus the Archer-God return’d.
12339,BOOK XV.,Courage this moment! such a helper Jove315
12340,BOOK XV.,From Ida sends thee at thy side to war
12341,BOOK XV.,"Continual, Phœbus of the golden sword,"
12342,BOOK XV.,Whose guardian aid both thee and lofty Troy
12343,BOOK XV.,Hath succor’d many a time. Therefore arise!
12344,BOOK XV.,Instant bid drive thy numerous charioteers320
12345,BOOK XV.,Their rapid steeds full on the Grecian fleet;
12346,BOOK XV.,"I, marching at their head, will smooth, myself,"
12347,BOOK XV.,"The way before them, and will turn again"
12348,BOOK XV.,To flight the heroes of the host of Greece.
12349,BOOK XV.,He said and with new strength the Chief inspired.325
12350,BOOK XV.,"As some stall’d horse high pamper’d, snapping short"
12351,BOOK XV.,"His cord, beats under foot the sounding soil,"
12352,BOOK XV.,Accustom’d in smooth-sliding streams to lave
12353,BOOK XV.,"Exulting; high he bears his head, his mane"
12354,BOOK XV.,"Wantons around his shoulders; pleased, he eyes330"
12355,BOOK XV.,"His glossy sides, and borne on pliant knees"
12356,BOOK XV.,Soon finds the haunts where all his fellows graze;
12357,BOOK XV.,"So bounded Hector, and his agile joints"
12358,BOOK XV.,"Plied lightly, quicken’d by the voice divine,"
12359,BOOK XV.,And gather’d fast his charioteers to battle.335
12360,BOOK XV.,But as when hounds and hunters through the woods
12361,BOOK XV.,"Rush in pursuit of stag or of wild goat,"
12362,BOOK XV.,"He, in some cave with tangled boughs o’erhung,"
12363,BOOK XV.,"Lies safe conceal’d, no destined prey of theirs,"
12364,BOOK XV.,"Till by their clamors roused, a lion grim340"
12365,BOOK XV.,"Starts forth to meet them; then, the boldest fly;"
12366,BOOK XV.,"Such hot pursuit the Danaï, with swords"
12367,BOOK XV.,And spears of double edge long time maintain’d.
12368,BOOK XV.,But seeing Hector in his ranks again
12369,BOOK XV.,"Occupied, felt at once their courage fall’n.345"
12370,BOOK XV.,"Then, Thoas them, Andræmon’s son, address’d,"
12371,BOOK XV.,"Foremost of the Ætolians, at the spear"
12372,BOOK XV.,"Skilful, in stationary combat bold,"
12373,BOOK XV.,And when the sons of Greece held in dispute
12374,BOOK XV.,"The prize of eloquence, excell’d by few.350"
12375,BOOK XV.,"Prudent advising them, he thus began."
12376,BOOK XV.,Ye Gods! what prodigy do I behold?
12377,BOOK XV.,"Hath Hector, ’scaping death, risen again?"
12378,BOOK XV.,"For him, with confident persuasion all"
12379,BOOK XV.,Believed by Telamonian Ajax slain.355
12380,BOOK XV.,But some Divinity hath interposed
12381,BOOK XV.,"To rescue and save Hector, who the joints"
12382,BOOK XV.,"Hath stiffen’d of full many a valiant Greek,"
12383,BOOK XV.,"As surely now he shall; for, not without"
12384,BOOK XV.,"The Thunderer’s aid, he flames in front again.360"
12385,BOOK XV.,But take ye all my counsel. Send we back
12386,BOOK XV.,"The multitude into the fleet, and first"
12387,BOOK XV.,"Let us, who boast ourselves bravest in fight,"
12388,BOOK XV.,"Stand, that encountering him with lifted spears,"
12389,BOOK XV.,We may attempt to give his rage a check.365
12390,BOOK XV.,To thrust himself into a band like ours
12391,BOOK XV.,"Will, doubtless, even in Hector move a fear."
12392,BOOK XV.,"He ceased, with whose advice all, glad, complied."
12393,BOOK XV.,"Then Ajax with Idomeneus of Crete,"
12394,BOOK XV.,"Teucer, Meriones, and Meges fierce370"
12395,BOOK XV.,"As Mars in battle, summoning aloud"
12396,BOOK XV.,"The noblest Greeks, in opposition firm"
12397,BOOK XV.,"To Hector and his host their bands prepared,"
12398,BOOK XV.,While others all into the fleet retired.
12399,BOOK XV.,Troy’s crowded host[8] struck first. With awful strides375
12400,BOOK XV.,"Came Hector foremost; him Apollo led,"
12401,BOOK XV.,"His shoulders wrapt in clouds, and, on his arm,"
12402,BOOK XV.,"The Ægis shagg’d terrific all around,"
12403,BOOK XV.,"Tempestuous, dazzling-bright; it was a gift"
12404,BOOK XV.,"To Jove from Vulcan, and design’d to appall,380"
12405,BOOK XV.,And drive to flight the armies of the earth.
12406,BOOK XV.,Arm’d with that shield Apollo led them on.
12407,BOOK XV.,Firm stood the embodied Greeks; from either host
12408,BOOK XV.,Shrill cries arose; the arrows from the nerve
12409,BOOK XV.,"Leap’d, and, by vigorous arms dismiss’d, the spears385"
12410,BOOK XV.,Flew frequent; in the flesh some stood infixt
12411,BOOK XV.,"Of warlike youths, but many, ere they reach’d"
12412,BOOK XV.,"The mark they coveted, unsated fell"
12413,BOOK XV.,"Between the hosts, and rested in the soil."
12414,BOOK XV.,Long as the God unagitated held390
12415,BOOK XV.,"The dreadful disk, so long the vollied darts"
12416,BOOK XV.,"Made mutual slaughter, and the people fell;"
12417,BOOK XV.,But when he look’d the Grecian charioteers
12418,BOOK XV.,"Full in the face and shook it, raising high"
12419,BOOK XV.,"Himself the shout of battle, then he quell’d395"
12420,BOOK XV.,"Their spirits, then he struck from every mind"
12421,BOOK XV.,At once all memory of their might in arms.
12422,BOOK XV.,"As when two lions in the still, dark night"
12423,BOOK XV.,A herd of beeves scatter or numerous flock
12424,BOOK XV.,"Suddenly, in the absence of the guard,400"
12425,BOOK XV.,"So fled the heartless Greeks, for Phœbus sent"
12426,BOOK XV.,"Terrors among them, but renown conferr’d"
12427,BOOK XV.,And triumph proud on Hector and his host.
12428,BOOK XV.,"Then, in that foul disorder of the field,"
12429,BOOK XV.,Man singled man. Arcesilaüs died405
12430,BOOK XV.,"By Hector’s arm, and Stichius; one, a Chief[9]"
12431,BOOK XV.,"Of the Bœotians brazen-mail’d, and one,"
12432,BOOK XV.,Menestheus’ faithful follower to the fight.
12433,BOOK XV.,Æneas Medon and Iäsus slew.
12434,BOOK XV.,Medon was spurious offspring of divine410
12435,BOOK XV.,"Oïleus Ajax’ father, and abode"
12436,BOOK XV.,In Phylace; for he had slain a Chief
12437,BOOK XV.,Brother of Eriopis the espoused
12438,BOOK XV.,Of brave Oïleus; but Iäsus led
12439,BOOK XV.,"A phalanx of Athenians, and the son415"
12440,BOOK XV.,"Of Sphelus, son of Bucolus was deem’d."
12441,BOOK XV.,"Pierced by Polydamas Mecisteus fell,"
12442,BOOK XV.,"Polites, in the van of battle, slew"
12443,BOOK XV.,"Echion, and Agenor Clonius;"
12444,BOOK XV.,"But Paris, while Deïochus to flight420"
12445,BOOK XV.,"Turn’d with the routed van, pierced him beneath"
12446,BOOK XV.,"His shoulder-blade, and urged the weapon through."
12447,BOOK XV.,"While them the Trojans spoil’d, meantime the Greeks,"
12448,BOOK XV.,"Entangled in the piles of the deep foss,"
12449,BOOK XV.,"Fled every way, and through necessity425"
12450,BOOK XV.,Repass’d the wall. Then Hector with a voice
12451,BOOK XV.,Of loud command bade every Trojan cease
12452,BOOK XV.,"From spoil, and rush impetuous on the fleet."
12453,BOOK XV.,[10]And whom I find far lingering from the ships
12454,BOOK XV.,"Wherever, there he dies; no funeral fires430"
12455,BOOK XV.,"Brother on him, or sister, shall bestow,"
12456,BOOK XV.,But dogs shall rend him in the sight of Troy.
12457,BOOK XV.,"So saying, he lash’d the shoulders of his steeds,"
12458,BOOK XV.,"And through the ranks vociferating, call’d"
12459,BOOK XV.,"His Trojans on; they, clamorous as he,435"
12460,BOOK XV.,"All lash’d their steeds, and menacing, advanced."
12461,BOOK XV.,Before them with his feet Apollo push’d
12462,BOOK XV.,"The banks into the foss, bridging the gulf"
12463,BOOK XV.,"With pass commodious, both in length and breadth"
12464,BOOK XV.,"A lance’s flight, for proof of vigor hurl’d.440"
12465,BOOK XV.,"There, phalanx after phalanx, they their host"
12466,BOOK XV.,"Pour’d dense along, while Phœbus in the van"
12467,BOOK XV.,"Display’d the awful ægis, and the wall"
12468,BOOK XV.,"Levell’d with ease divine. As, on the shore"
12469,BOOK XV.,"Some wanton boy with sand builds plaything walls,445"
12470,BOOK XV.,"Then, sportive spreads them with his feet abroad,"
12471,BOOK XV.,"So thou, shaft-arm’d Apollo! that huge work"
12472,BOOK XV.,Laborious of the Greeks didst turn with ease
12473,BOOK XV.,"To ruin, and themselves drovest all to flight."
12474,BOOK XV.,"They, thus enforced into the fleet, again450"
12475,BOOK XV.,"Stood fast, with mutual exhortation each"
12476,BOOK XV.,"His friend encouraging, and all the Gods"
12477,BOOK XV.,With lifted hands soliciting aloud.
12478,BOOK XV.,"But, more than all, Gerenian Nestor pray’d"
12479,BOOK XV.,"Fervent, Achaia’s guardian, and with arms455"
12480,BOOK XV.,"Outstretch’d toward the starry skies, exclaim’d."
12481,BOOK XV.,"Jove, Father! if in corn-clad Argos, one,"
12482,BOOK XV.,"One Greek hath ever, burning at thy shrine"
12483,BOOK XV.,"Fat thighs of sheep or oxen, ask’d from thee"
12484,BOOK XV.,"A safe return, whom thou hast gracious heard,460"
12485,BOOK XV.,"Olympian King! and promised what he sought,"
12486,BOOK XV.,"Now, in remembrance of it, give us help"
12487,BOOK XV.,"In this disastrous day, nor thus permit"
12488,BOOK XV.,Their Trojan foes to tread the Grecians down!
12489,BOOK XV.,"So Nestor pray’d, and Jove thunder’d aloud465"
12490,BOOK XV.,Responsive to the old Neleïan’s prayer.
12491,BOOK XV.,But when that voice of Ægis-bearing Jove
12492,BOOK XV.,"The Trojans heard, more furious on the Greeks"
12493,BOOK XV.,"They sprang, all mindful of the fight. As when"
12494,BOOK XV.,"A turgid billow of some spacious sea,470"
12495,BOOK XV.,"While the wind blow that heaves its highest, borne"
12496,BOOK XV.,"Sheer o’er the vessel’s side, rolls into her,"
12497,BOOK XV.,With such loud roar the Trojans pass’d the wall;
12498,BOOK XV.,"In rush’d the steeds, and at the ships they waged"
12499,BOOK XV.,"Fierce battle hand to hand, from chariots, these,475"
12500,BOOK XV.,"With spears of double edge, those, from the decks"
12501,BOOK XV.,"Of many a sable bark, with naval poles"
12502,BOOK XV.,"Long, ponderous, shod with steel; for every ship"
12503,BOOK XV.,"Had such, for conflict maritime prepared."
12504,BOOK XV.,While yet the battle raged only without480
12505,BOOK XV.,"The wall, and from the ships apart, so long"
12506,BOOK XV.,Patroclus quiet in the tent and calm
12507,BOOK XV.,"Sat of Eurypylus, his generous friend"
12508,BOOK XV.,"Consoling with sweet converse, and his wound"
12509,BOOK XV.,Sprinkling with drugs assuasive of his pains.485
12510,BOOK XV.,But soon as through the broken rampart borne
12511,BOOK XV.,"He saw the Trojans, and the clamor heard"
12512,BOOK XV.,"And tumult of the flying Greeks, a voice"
12513,BOOK XV.,"Of loud lament uttering, with open palms"
12514,BOOK XV.,"His thighs he smote, and, sorrowful, exclaim’d.490"
12515,BOOK XV.,"Eurypylus! although thy need be great,"
12516,BOOK XV.,"No longer may I now sit at thy side,"
12517,BOOK XV.,Such contest hath arisen; thy servant’s voice
12518,BOOK XV.,"Must soothe thee now, for I will to the tent"
12519,BOOK XV.,"Haste of Achilles, and exhort him forth;495"
12520,BOOK XV.,"Who knows? if such the pleasure of the Gods,"
12521,BOOK XV.,I may prevail; friends rarely plead in vain.
12522,BOOK XV.,"So saying, he went. Meantime the Greeks endured"
12523,BOOK XV.,"The Trojan onset, firm, yet from the ships"
12524,BOOK XV.,"Repulsed them not, though fewer than themselves,500"
12525,BOOK XV.,"Nor could the host of Troy, breaking the ranks"
12526,BOOK XV.,"Of Greece, mix either with the camp or fleet;"
12527,BOOK XV.,"But as the line divides the plank aright,"
12528,BOOK XV.,"Stretch’d by some naval architect, whose hand"
12529,BOOK XV.,"Minerva hath accomplish’d in his art,505"
12530,BOOK XV.,So stretch’d on them the cord of battle lay.
12531,BOOK XV.,"Others at other ships the conflict waged,"
12532,BOOK XV.,But Hector to the ship advanced direct
12533,BOOK XV.,Of glorious Ajax; for one ship they strove;
12534,BOOK XV.,"Nor Hector, him dislodging thence, could fire510"
12535,BOOK XV.,"The fleet, nor Ajax from the fleet repulse"
12536,BOOK XV.,"Hector, conducted thither by the Gods."
12537,BOOK XV.,"Then, noble Ajax with a spear the breast"
12538,BOOK XV.,"Pierced of Caletor, son of Clytius, arm’d"
12539,BOOK XV.,"With fire to burn his bark; sounding he fell,515"
12540,BOOK XV.,And from his loosen’d grasp down dropp’d the brand.
12541,BOOK XV.,But Hector seeing his own kinsman fallen
12542,BOOK XV.,"Beneath the sable bark, with mighty voice"
12543,BOOK XV.,Call’d on the hosts of Lycia and of Troy.
12544,BOOK XV.,"Trojans and Lycians, and close-fighting sons520"
12545,BOOK XV.,"Of Dardanus, within this narrow pass"
12546,BOOK XV.,"Stand firm, retreat not, but redeem the son"
12547,BOOK XV.,"Of Clytius, lest the Grecians of his arms"
12548,BOOK XV.,Despoil him slain in battle at the ships.
12549,BOOK XV.,
12550,BOOK XV.,"So saying, at Ajax his bright spear he cast525"
12551,BOOK XV.,"Him pierced he not, but Lycophron the son"
12552,BOOK XV.,"Of Mastor, a Cytherian, who had left"
12553,BOOK XV.,"Cytheras, fugitive for blood, and dwelt"
12554,BOOK XV.,"With Ajax. Him standing at Ajax’ side,"
12555,BOOK XV.,He pierced above his ear; down from the stern530
12556,BOOK XV.,"Supine he fell, and in the dust expired."
12557,BOOK XV.,"Then, shuddering, Ajax to his brother spake."
12558,BOOK XV.,"Alas, my Teucer! we have lost our friend;"
12559,BOOK XV.,"Mastorides is slain, whom we received"
12560,BOOK XV.,"An inmate from Cytheræ, and with love535"
12561,BOOK XV.,"And reverence even filia,, entertain’d;"
12562,BOOK XV.,"B9 Hector pierced, he dies. Where are thy shafts"
12563,BOOK XV.,"Death-wing’d, and bow, by gift from Phœbus thine?"
12564,BOOK XV.,"He said, whom Teucer hearing, instant ran"
12565,BOOK XV.,"With bow and well-stored quiver to his side,540"
12566,BOOK XV.,Whence soon his arrows sought the Trojan host.
12567,BOOK XV.,"He struck Pisenor’s son Clytus, the friend"
12568,BOOK XV.,"And charioteer of brave Polydamas,"
12569,BOOK XV.,"Offspring of Panthus, toiling with both hands"
12570,BOOK XV.,To rule his fiery steeds; for more to please545
12571,BOOK XV.,"The Trojans and their Chief, where stormy most"
12572,BOOK XV.,"He saw the battle, thither he had driven."
12573,BOOK XV.,"But sudden mischief, valiant as he was,"
12574,BOOK XV.,"Found him, and such as none could waft aside,"
12575,BOOK XV.,"For right into his neck the arrow plunged,550"
12576,BOOK XV.,And down he fell; his startled coursers shook
12577,BOOK XV.,"Their trappings, and the empty chariot rang."
12578,BOOK XV.,"That sound alarm’d Polydamas; he turn’d,"
12579,BOOK XV.,"And flying to their heads, consign’d them o’er"
12580,BOOK XV.,"To Protiaön’s son, Astynoüs,555"
12581,BOOK XV.,Whom he enjoin’d to keep them in his view;
12582,BOOK XV.,"Then, turning, mingled with the van again."
12583,BOOK XV.,But Teucer still another shaft produced
12584,BOOK XV.,"Design’d for valiant Hector, whose exploits"
12585,BOOK XV.,(Had that shaft reach’d him) at the ships of Greece560
12586,BOOK XV.,"Had ceased for ever. But the eye of Jove,"
12587,BOOK XV.,"Guardian of Hector’s life, slept not; he took"
12588,BOOK XV.,"From Telamonian Te5cer that renown,"
12589,BOOK XV.,And while he stood straining the twisted nerve
12590,BOOK XV.,"Against the Trojan, snapp’d it. Devious flew565"
12591,BOOK XV.,"The steel-charged[11] arrow, and he dropp’d his bow."
12592,BOOK XV.,"Then shuddering, to his brother thus he spake."
12593,BOOK XV.,Ah! it is evident. Some Power divine
12594,BOOK XV.,"Makes fruitless all our efforts, who hath struck"
12595,BOOK XV.,"My bow out of my hand, and snapt the cord570"
12596,BOOK XV.,"With which I strung it new at dawn of day,"
12597,BOOK XV.,That it might bear the bound of many a shaft.
12598,BOOK XV.,To whom the towering son of Telamon.
12599,BOOK XV.,"Leave then thy bow, and let thine arrows rest,"
12600,BOOK XV.,"Which, envious of the Greeks, some God confounds,575"
12601,BOOK XV.,"That thou may’st fight with spear and buckler arm’d,"
12602,BOOK XV.,And animate the rest. Such be our deeds
12603,BOOK XV.,"That, should they conquer us, our foes may find"
12604,BOOK XV.,"Our ships, at least a prize not lightly won."
12605,BOOK XV.,"So Ajax spake; then Teucer, in his tent580"
12606,BOOK XV.,"The bow replacing, slung his fourfold shield,"
12607,BOOK XV.,Settled on his illustrious brows his casque
12608,BOOK XV.,"With hair high-crested, waving, as he moved,"
12609,BOOK XV.,"Terrible from above, took forth a spear"
12610,BOOK XV.,"Tough-grain’d, acuminated sharp with brass,585"
12611,BOOK XV.,"And stood, incontinent, at Ajax’ side."
12612,BOOK XV.,"Hector perceived the change, and of the cause"
12613,BOOK XV.,"Conscious, with echoing voice call’d to his host."
12614,BOOK XV.,Trojans and Lycians and close-fighting sons
12615,BOOK XV.,"Of Dardanus, oh now, my friends, be men;590"
12616,BOOK XV.,"Now, wheresoever through the fleet dispersed,"
12617,BOOK XV.,Call into mind the fury of your might!
12618,BOOK XV.,"For I have seen, myself, Jove rendering vain"
12619,BOOK XV.,The arrows of their mightiest. Man may know
12620,BOOK XV.,"With ease the hand of interposing Jove,595"
12621,BOOK XV.,"Both whom to glory he ordains, and whom"
12622,BOOK XV.,He weakens and aids not; so now he leaves
12623,BOOK XV.,"The Grecians, but propitious smiles on us."
12624,BOOK XV.,"Therefore stand fast, and whosoever gall’d"
12625,BOOK XV.,"By arrow or by spear, dies—let him die;600"
12626,BOOK XV.,It shall not shame him that he died to serve
12627,BOOK XV.,"His country,[12] but his children, wife and home,"
12628,BOOK XV.,"With all his heritage, shall be secure,"
12629,BOOK XV.,Drive but the Grecians from the shores of Troy.
12630,BOOK XV.,"So saying, he animated each. Meantime,605"
12631,BOOK XV.,Ajax his fellow-warriors thus address’d.
12632,BOOK XV.,"Shame on you all! Now, Grecians, either die,"
12633,BOOK XV.,Or save at once your galley and yourselves.
12634,BOOK XV.,"Hope ye, that should your ships become the prize"
12635,BOOK XV.,"Of warlike Hector, ye shall yet return610"
12636,BOOK XV.,On foot? Or hear ye not the Chief aloud
12637,BOOK XV.,"Summoning all his host, and publishing"
12638,BOOK XV.,His own heart’s wish to burn your fleet with fire?
12639,BOOK XV.,"Not to a dance, believe me, but to fight"
12640,BOOK XV.,He calls them; therefore wiser course for us615
12641,BOOK XV.,"Is none, than that we mingle hands with hands"
12642,BOOK XV.,"In contest obstinate, and force with force."
12643,BOOK XV.,"Better at once to perish, or at once"
12644,BOOK XV.,"To rescue life, than to consume the time"
12645,BOOK XV.,Hour after hour in lingering conflict vain620
12646,BOOK XV.,"Here at the ships, with an inferior foe."
12647,BOOK XV.,"He said, and by his words into all hearts"
12648,BOOK XV.,Fresh confidence infused. Then Hector smote
12649,BOOK XV.,"Schedius, a Chief of the Phocensian powers"
12650,BOOK XV.,"And son of Perimedes; Ajax slew,625"
12651,BOOK XV.,"Meantime, a Chief of Trojan infantry,"
12652,BOOK XV.,"Laodamas, Antenor’s noble son"
12653,BOOK XV.,"While by Polydamas, a leader bold"
12654,BOOK XV.,"Of the Epeans, and Phylides’[13] friend,"
12655,BOOK XV.,Cyllenian Otus died. Meges that sight630
12656,BOOK XV.,"Viewing indignant on the conqueror sprang,"
12657,BOOK XV.,"But, starting wide, Polydamas escaped,"
12658,BOOK XV.,"Saved by Apollo, and his spear transpierced"
12659,BOOK XV.,The breast of Cræsmus; on his sounding shield
12660,BOOK XV.,"Prostrate he fell, and Meges stripp’d his arms.635"
12661,BOOK XV.,"Him so employ’d Dolops assail’d, brave son"
12662,BOOK XV.,"Of Lampus, best of men and bold in fight,"
12663,BOOK XV.,Offspring of King Laomedon; he stood
12664,BOOK XV.,"Full near, and through his middle buckler struck"
12665,BOOK XV.,"The son of Phyleus, but his corselet thick640"
12666,BOOK XV.,With plates of scaly brass his life secured.
12667,BOOK XV.,That corselet Phyleus on a time brought home
12668,BOOK XV.,"From Ephyre, where the Selleïs winds,"
12669,BOOK XV.,And it was given him for his life’s defence
12670,BOOK XV.,"In furious battle by the King of men,645"
12671,BOOK XV.,Euphetes. Many a time had it preserved
12672,BOOK XV.,"Unharm’d the sire, and now it saved the son."
12673,BOOK XV.,"Then Meges, rising, with his pointed lance"
12674,BOOK XV.,The bushy crest of Dolops’ helmet drove
12675,BOOK XV.,Sheer from its base; new-tinged with purple bright650
12676,BOOK XV.,Entire it fell and mingled with the dust.
12677,BOOK XV.,"While thus they strove, each hoping victory,"
12678,BOOK XV.,Came martial Menelaus to the aid
12679,BOOK XV.,Of Meges; spear in hand apart he stood
12680,BOOK XV.,"By Dolops unperceived, through his back drove655"
12681,BOOK XV.,"And through his breast the spear, and far beyond."
12682,BOOK XV.,"And down fell Dolops, forehead to the ground."
12683,BOOK XV.,"At once both flew to strip his radiant arms,"
12684,BOOK XV.,"Then, Hector summoning his kindred, call’d"
12685,BOOK XV.,"Each to his aid, and Melanippus first,660"
12686,BOOK XV.,"Illustrious Hicetaon’s son, reproved."
12687,BOOK XV.,Ere yet the enemies of Troy arrived
12688,BOOK XV.,He in Percote fed his wandering beeves;
12689,BOOK XV.,But when the Danaï with all their fleet
12690,BOOK XV.,"Came thither, then returning, he outshone665"
12691,BOOK XV.,"The noblest Trojans, and at Priam’s side"
12692,BOOK XV.,"Dwelling, was honor’d by him as a son."
12693,BOOK XV.,"Him Hector reprimanding, stern began."
12694,BOOK XV.,Are we thus slack? Can Melanippus view
12695,BOOK XV.,Unmoved a kinsman slain? Seest not the Greeks670
12696,BOOK XV.,How busy there with Dolops and his arms?
12697,BOOK XV.,"Come on. It is no time for distant war,"
12698,BOOK XV.,"But either our Achaian foes must bleed,"
12699,BOOK XV.,"Or Ilium taken, from her topmost height"
12700,BOOK XV.,"Must stoop, and all her citizens be slain.675"

12702,BOOK XV.,"Attended; and the Telamonian, next,"
12703,BOOK XV.,"Huge Ajax, animated thus the Greeks."
12704,BOOK XV.,"Oh friends, be men! Deep treasure in your hearts"
12705,BOOK XV.,"An honest shame, and, fighting bravely, fear680"
12706,BOOK XV.,Each to incur the censure of the rest.
12707,BOOK XV.,"Of men so minded more survive than die,"
12708,BOOK XV.,While dastards forfeit life and glory both.
12709,BOOK XV.,"So moved he them, themselves already bent"
12710,BOOK XV.,To chase the Trojans; yet his word they bore685
12711,BOOK XV.,"Faithful in mind, and with a wall of brass"
12712,BOOK XV.,"Fenced firm the fleet, while Jove impell’d the foe."
12713,BOOK XV.,"Then Menelaus, brave in fight, approach’d"
12714,BOOK XV.,"Antilochus, and thus his courage roused."
12715,BOOK XV.,Antilochus! in all the host is none690
12716,BOOK XV.,"Younger, or swifter, or of stronger limb"
12717,BOOK XV.,"Than thou. Make trial, therefore, of thy might,"
12718,BOOK XV.,Spring forth and prove it on some Chief of Troy.
12719,BOOK XV.,"He ended and retired, but him his praise"
12720,BOOK XV.,Effectual animated; from the van695
12721,BOOK XV.,"Starting, he cast a wistful eye around"
12722,BOOK XV.,And hurl’d his glittering spear; back fell the ranks
12723,BOOK XV.,"Of Troy appall’d; nor vain his weapon flew,"
12724,BOOK XV.,But Melanippus pierced heroic son
12725,BOOK XV.,"Of Hicetaon, coming forth to fight,700"
12726,BOOK XV.,"Full in the bosom, and with dreadful sound"
12727,BOOK XV.,Of all his batter’d armor down he fell.
12728,BOOK XV.,Swift flew Antilochus as flies the hound
12729,BOOK XV.,"Some fawn to seize, which issuing from her lair"
12730,BOOK XV.,"The hunter with his lance hath stricken dead,705"
12731,BOOK XV.,"So thee, O Melanippus! to despoil"
12732,BOOK XV.,Of thy bright arms valiant Antilochus
12733,BOOK XV.,"Sprang forth, but not unnoticed by the eye"
12734,BOOK XV.,"Of noble Hector, who through all the war"
12735,BOOK XV.,Ran to encounter him; his dread approach710
12736,BOOK XV.,"Antilochus, although expert in arms,"
12737,BOOK XV.,"Stood not, but as some prowler of the wilds,"
12738,BOOK XV.,"Conscious of injury that he hath done,"
12739,BOOK XV.,"Slaying the watchful herdsman or his dog,"
12740,BOOK XV.,"Escapes, ere yet the peasantry arise,715"
12741,BOOK XV.,"So fled the son of Nestor, after whom"
12742,BOOK XV.,The Trojans clamoring and Hector pour’d
12743,BOOK XV.,Darts numberless; but at the front arrived
12744,BOOK XV.,"Of his own phalanx, there he turn’d and stood."
12745,BOOK XV.,"Then, eager as voracious lions, rush’d720"
12746,BOOK XV.,"The Trojans on the fleet of Greece, the mind"
12747,BOOK XV.,Of Jove accomplishing who them impell’d
12748,BOOK XV.,"Continual, calling all their courage forth,"
12749,BOOK XV.,"While, every Grecian heart he tamed, and took"
12750,BOOK XV.,"Their glory from them, strengthening Ilium’s host.725"
12751,BOOK XV.,For Jove’s unalter’d purpose was to give
12752,BOOK XV.,"Success to Priameian Hector’s arms,[14]"
12753,BOOK XV.,That he might cast into the fleet of Greece
12754,BOOK XV.,"Devouring flames, and that no part might fail"
12755,BOOK XV.,Of Thetis’ ruthless prayer; that sight alone730
12756,BOOK XV.,"He watch’d to see, one galley in a blaze,"
12757,BOOK XV.,"Ordaining foul repulse, thenceforth, and flight"
12758,BOOK XV.,"To Ilium’s host, but glory to the Greeks."
12759,BOOK XV.,"Such was the cause for which, at first, he moved"
12760,BOOK XV.,"To that assault Hector, himself prepared735"
12761,BOOK XV.,And ardent for the task; nor less he raged
12762,BOOK XV.,"Than Mars while fighting, or than flames that seize"
12763,BOOK XV.,Some forest on the mountain-tops; the foam
12764,BOOK XV.,"Hung at his lips, beneath his awful front"
12765,BOOK XV.,"His keen eyes glisten’d, and his helmet mark’d740"
12766,BOOK XV.,The agitation wild with which he fought.
12767,BOOK XV.,"For Jove omnipotent, himself, from heaven"
12768,BOOK XV.,"Assisted Hector, and, although alone"
12769,BOOK XV.,"With multitudes he strove, gave him to reach"
12770,BOOK XV.,"The heights of glory, for that now his life745"
12771,BOOK XV.,"Waned fast, and, urged by Pallas on,[15] his hour"
12772,BOOK XV.,To die by Peleus’ mighty son approach’d.
12773,BOOK XV.,"He then, wherever richest arms he saw"
12774,BOOK XV.,"And thickest throng, the warrior-ranks essay’d"
12775,BOOK XV.,"To break, but broke them not, though fierce resolved,750"
12776,BOOK XV.,In even square compact so firm they stood.
12777,BOOK XV.,As some vast rock beside the hoary Deep
12778,BOOK XV.,"The stress endures of many a hollow wind,"
12779,BOOK XV.,"And the huge billows tumbling at his base,"
12780,BOOK XV.,"So stood the Danaï, nor fled nor fear’d.755"
12781,BOOK XV.,"But he, all-fiery bright in arms, the host"
12782,BOOK XV.,"Assail’d on every side, and on the van"
12783,BOOK XV.,"Fell, as a wave by wintry blasts upheaved"
12784,BOOK XV.,Falls ponderous on the ship; white clings the foam
12785,BOOK XV.,"Around her, in her sail shrill howls the storm,760"
12786,BOOK XV.,And every seaman trembles at the view
12787,BOOK XV.,"Of thousand deaths from which he scarce escapes,"
12788,BOOK XV.,Such anguish rent the bosom of the Greeks.
12789,BOOK XV.,"But he, as leaps a famish’d lion fell"
12790,BOOK XV.,"On beeves that graze some marshy meadow’s breadth,765"
12791,BOOK XV.,"A countless herd, tended by one unskill’d"
12792,BOOK XV.,"To cope with savage beasts in their defence,"
12793,BOOK XV.,Beside the foremost kine or with the last
12794,BOOK XV.,"He paces heedless, but the lion, borne"
12795,BOOK XV.,"Impetuous on the midmost, one devours770"
12796,BOOK XV.,"And scatters all the rest,[16] so fled the Greeks,"
12797,BOOK XV.,"Terrified from above, before the arm"
12798,BOOK XV.,"Of Hector, and before the frown of Jove."
12799,BOOK XV.,"All fled, but of them all alone he slew"
12800,BOOK XV.,"The Mycenæan Periphetes, son775"
12801,BOOK XV.,Of Copreus custom’d messenger of King
12802,BOOK XV.,Eurystheus to the might of Hercules.
12803,BOOK XV.,From such a sire inglorious had arisen
12804,BOOK XV.,"A son far worthier, with all virtue graced,"
12805,BOOK XV.,"Swift-footed, valiant, and by none excell’d780"
12806,BOOK XV.,In wisdom of the Mycenæan name;
12807,BOOK XV.,Yet all but served to ennoble Hector more.
12808,BOOK XV.,"For Periphetes, with a backward step"
12809,BOOK XV.,"Retiring, on his buckler’s border trod,"
12810,BOOK XV.,"Which swept his heels; so check’d, he fell supine,785"
12811,BOOK XV.,And dreadful rang the helmet on his brows.
12812,BOOK XV.,"Him Hector quick noticing, to his side"
12813,BOOK XV.,"Hasted, and, planting in his breast a spear,"
12814,BOOK XV.,Slew him before the phalanx of his friends.
12815,BOOK XV.,"But they, although their fellow-warrior’s fate790"
12816,BOOK XV.,"They mourn’d, no succor interposed, or could,"
12817,BOOK XV.,Themselves by noble Hector sore appall’d.
12818,BOOK XV.,And now behind the ships (all that updrawn
12819,BOOK XV.,"Above the shore, stood foremost of the fleet)"
12820,BOOK XV.,The Greeks retired; in rush’d a flood of foes;795
12821,BOOK XV.,"Then, through necessity, the ships in front"
12822,BOOK XV.,"Abandoning, amid the tents they stood"
12823,BOOK XV.,"Compact, not disarray’d, for shame and fear"
12824,BOOK XV.,"Fast held them, and vociferating each"
12825,BOOK XV.,"Aloud, call’d ceaseless on the rest to stand.800"
12826,BOOK XV.,"But earnest more than all, guardian of all,"
12827,BOOK XV.,Gerenian Nestor in their parents’ name
12828,BOOK XV.,"Implored them, falling at the knees of each."
12829,BOOK XV.,Oh friends! be men. Now dearly prize your place
12830,BOOK XV.,Each in the estimation of the rest.805
12831,BOOK XV.,"Now call to memory your children, wives,"
12832,BOOK XV.,"Possessions, parents; ye whose parents live,"
12833,BOOK XV.,"And ye whose parents are not, all alike!"
12834,BOOK XV.,"By them as if here present, I entreat"
12835,BOOK XV.,That ye stand fast—oh be not turn’d to flight!810
12836,BOOK XV.,So saying he roused the courage of the Greeks;
12837,BOOK XV.,"Then, Pallas chased the cloud fall’n from above"
12838,BOOK XV.,On every eye; great light the plain illumed
12839,BOOK XV.,"On all sides, both toward the fleet, and where"
12840,BOOK XV.,The undiscriminating battle raged.815
12841,BOOK XV.,Then might be seen Hector and Hector’s host
12842,BOOK XV.,"Distinct, as well the rearmost who the fight"
12843,BOOK XV.,"Shared not, as those who waged it at the ships."
12844,BOOK XV.,To stand aloof where other Grecians stood
12845,BOOK XV.,No longer now would satisfy the mind820
12846,BOOK XV.,"Of Ajax, but from deck to deck with strides"
12847,BOOK XV.,"Enormous marching, to and fro he swung"
12848,BOOK XV.,With iron studs emboss’d a battle-pole
12849,BOOK XV.,"Unwieldy, twenty and two cubits long."
12850,BOOK XV.,"As one expert to spring from horse to horse,825"
12851,BOOK XV.,"From many steeds selecting four, toward"
12852,BOOK XV.,Some noble city drives them from the plain
12853,BOOK XV.,Along the populous road; him many a youth
12854,BOOK XV.,"And many a maiden eyes, while still secure"
12855,BOOK XV.,From steed to steed he vaults; they rapid fly;830
12856,BOOK XV.,So Ajax o’er the decks of numerous ships
12857,BOOK XV.,"Stalk’d striding large, and sent his voice to heaven."
12858,BOOK XV.,"Thus, ever clamoring, he bade the Greeks"
12859,BOOK XV.,Stand both for camp and fleet. Nor could himself
12860,BOOK XV.,"Hector, contented, now, the battle wage835"
12861,BOOK XV.,"Lost in the multitude of Trojans more,"
12862,BOOK XV.,But as the tawny eagle on full wing
12863,BOOK XV.,"Assails the feather’d nations, geese or cranes"
12864,BOOK XV.,"Or swans lithe-neck’d grazing the river’s verge,"
12865,BOOK XV.,So Hector at a galley sable-prow’d840
12866,BOOK XV.,"Darted; for, from behind, Jove urged him on"
12867,BOOK XV.,"With mighty hand, and his host after him."
12868,BOOK XV.,And now again the battle at the ships
12869,BOOK XV.,Grew furious; thou hadst deem’d them of a kind
12870,BOOK XV.,"By toil untameable, so fierce they strove,845"
12871,BOOK XV.,"And, striving, thus they fought. The Grecians judged"
12872,BOOK XV.,"Hope vain, and the whole host’s destruction sure;"
12873,BOOK XV.,But nought expected every Trojan less
12874,BOOK XV.,"Than to consume the fleet with fire, and leave"
12875,BOOK XV.,Achaia’s heroes lifeless on the field.850
12876,BOOK XV.,"With such persuasions occupied, they fought."
12877,BOOK XV.,Then Hector seized the stern of a brave bark
12878,BOOK XV.,"Well-built, sharp-keel’d, and of the swiftest sail,"
12879,BOOK XV.,"Which had to Troy Protesiläus brought,"
12880,BOOK XV.,But bore him never thence. For that same ship855
12881,BOOK XV.,"Contending, Greeks and Trojans hand to hand"
12882,BOOK XV.,Dealt slaughter mutual. Javelins now no more
12883,BOOK XV.,"Might serve them, or the arrow-starting bow,"
12884,BOOK XV.,But close conflicting and of one mind all
12885,BOOK XV.,"With bill and battle-axe, with ponderous swords,860"
12886,BOOK XV.,And with long lances double-edged they fought.
12887,BOOK XV.,Many a black-hilted falchion huge of haft
12888,BOOK XV.,"Fell to the ground, some from the grasp, and some"
12889,BOOK XV.,"From shoulders of embattled warriors hewn,"
12890,BOOK XV.,And pools of blood soak’d all the sable glebe.865
12891,BOOK XV.,Hector that ship once grappled by the stern
12892,BOOK XV.,"Left not, but griping fast her upper edge"
12893,BOOK XV.,"With both hands, to his Trojans call’d aloud."
12894,BOOK XV.,Fire! Bring me fire! Stand fast and shout to heaven!
12895,BOOK XV.,Jove gives us now a day worth all the past;870
12896,BOOK XV.,"The ships are ours which, in the Gods’ despite"
12897,BOOK XV.,"Steer’d hither, such calamities to us"
12898,BOOK XV.,"Have caused, for which our seniors most I blame"
12899,BOOK XV.,Who me withheld from battle at the fleet
12900,BOOK XV.,And check’d the people; but if then the hand875
12901,BOOK XV.,"Of Thunderer Jove our better judgment marr’d,"
12902,BOOK XV.,Himself now urges and commands us on.
12903,BOOK XV.,He ceased; they still more violent assail’d
12904,BOOK XV.,"The Grecians. Even Ajax could endure,"
12905,BOOK XV.,"Whelm’d under weapons numberless, that storm880"
12906,BOOK XV.,"No longer, but expecting death retired"
12907,BOOK XV.,"Down from the decks to an inferior stand,"
12908,BOOK XV.,"Where still he watch’d, and if a Trojan bore"
12909,BOOK XV.,"Fire thither, he repulsed him with his spear,"
12910,BOOK XV.,Roaring continual to the host of Greece.885
12911,BOOK XV.,Friends! Grecian heroes! ministers of Mars!
12912,BOOK XV.,"Be men, my friends! now summon all your might!"
12913,BOOK XV.,Think we that we have thousands at our backs
12914,BOOK XV.,"To succor us, or yet some stronger wall"
12915,BOOK XV.,To guard our warriors from the battle’s force?890
12916,BOOK XV.,"Not so. No tower’d city is at hand,"
12917,BOOK XV.,None that presents us with a safe retreat
12918,BOOK XV.,"While others occupy our station here,"
12919,BOOK XV.,But from the shores of Argos far remote
12920,BOOK XV.,"Our camp is, where the Trojans arm’d complete895"
12921,BOOK XV.,"Swarm on the plain, and Ocean shuts us in."
12922,BOOK XV.,"Our hands must therefore save us, not our heels"
12923,BOOK XV.,"He said, and furious with his spear again"
12924,BOOK XV.,"Press’d them, and whatsoever Trojan came,"
12925,BOOK XV.,"Obsequious to the will of Hector, arm’d900"
12926,BOOK XV.,"With fire to burn the fleet, on his spear’s point"
12927,BOOK XV.,"Ajax receiving pierced him, till at length"
12928,BOOK XV.,Twelve in close fight fell by his single arm.

13058,BOOK XVI.,"Thy slaughtering legions to the walls of Troy,"
13059,BOOK XVI.,Lest some immortal power on her behalf
13060,BOOK XVI.,"Descend, for much the Archer of the skies"
13061,BOOK XVI.,"Loves Ilium. No—the fleet once saved, lead back115"
13062,BOOK XVI.,"Thy band, and leave the battle to themselves."
13063,BOOK XVI.,"For oh, by all the powers of heaven I would"
13064,BOOK XVI.,"That not one Trojan might escape of all,"
13065,BOOK XVI.,"Nor yet a Grecian, but that we, from death"
13066,BOOK XVI.,"Ourselves escaping, might survive to spread120"
13067,BOOK XVI.,"Troy’s sacred bulwarks on the ground, alone."
13068,BOOK XVI.,Thus they conferr’d. [5]But Ajax overwhelm’d
13069,BOOK XVI.,"Meantime with darts, no longer could endure,"
13070,BOOK XVI.,Quell’d both by Jupiter and by the spears
13071,BOOK XVI.,Of many a noble Trojan; hideous rang125
13072,BOOK XVI.,"His batter’d helmet bright, stroke after stroke"
13073,BOOK XVI.,"Sustaining on all sides, and his left arm"
13074,BOOK XVI.,That had so long shifted from side to side
13075,BOOK XVI.,"His restless shield, now fail’d; yet could not all"
13076,BOOK XVI.,"Displace him with united force, or move.130"
13077,BOOK XVI.,"Quick pantings heaved his chest, copious the sweat"
13078,BOOK XVI.,"Trickled from all his limbs, nor found he time,"
13079,BOOK XVI.,"However short, to breathe again, so close"
13080,BOOK XVI.,Evil on evil heap’d hemm’d him around.
13081,BOOK XVI.,"Olympian Muses! now declare, how first135"
13082,BOOK XVI.,The fire was kindled in Achaia’s fleet?
13083,BOOK XVI.,Hector the ashen lance of Ajax smote
13084,BOOK XVI.,"With his broad falchion, at the nether end,"
13085,BOOK XVI.,And lopp’d it sheer. The Telamonian Chief
13086,BOOK XVI.,"His mutilated beam brandish’d in vain,140"
13087,BOOK XVI.,And the bright point shrill-sounding-fell remote.
13088,BOOK XVI.,"Then Ajax in his noble mind perceived,"
13089,BOOK XVI.,"Shuddering with awe, the interposing power"
13090,BOOK XVI.,"Of heaven, and that, propitious to the arms"
13091,BOOK XVI.,"Of Troy, the Thunderer had ordain’d to mar145"
13092,BOOK XVI.,And frustrate all the counsels of the Greeks.
13093,BOOK XVI.,He left his stand; they fired the gallant bark;
13094,BOOK XVI.,Through all her length the conflagration ran
13095,BOOK XVI.,"Incontinent, and wrapp’d her stern in flames."
13096,BOOK XVI.,"Achilles saw them, smote his thighs, and said,150"
13097,BOOK XVI.,"Patroclus, noble charioteer, arise!"
13098,BOOK XVI.,I see the rapid run of hostile fires
13099,BOOK XVI.,"Already in the fleet—lest all be lost,"
13100,BOOK XVI.,"And our return impossible, arm, arm"
13101,BOOK XVI.,"This moment; I will call, myself, the band.155"
13102,BOOK XVI.,Then put Patroclus on his radiant arms.
13103,BOOK XVI.,"Around his legs his polish’d greaves he clasp’d,"
13104,BOOK XVI.,With argent studs secured; the hauberk rich
13105,BOOK XVI.,Star-spangled to his breast he bound of swift
13106,BOOK XVI.,Æacides; he slung his brazen sword160
13107,BOOK XVI.,"With silver bright emboss’d, and his broad shield"
13108,BOOK XVI.,Ponderous; on his noble head his casque
13109,BOOK XVI.,"He settled elegant, whose lofty crest"
13110,BOOK XVI.,"Waved dreadful o’er his brows, and last he seized"
13111,BOOK XVI.,Well fitted to his gripe two sturdy spears.165
13112,BOOK XVI.,Of all Achilles’ arms his spear alone
13113,BOOK XVI.,"He took not; that huge beam, of bulk and length"
13114,BOOK XVI.,"Enormous, none, Æacides except,"
13115,BOOK XVI.,In all Achaia’s host had power to wield.
13116,BOOK XVI.,It was that Pelian ash which from the top170
13117,BOOK XVI.,Of Pelion hewn that it might prove the death
13118,BOOK XVI.,"Of heroes, Chiron had to Peleus given."
13119,BOOK XVI.,He bade Automedon his coursers bind
13120,BOOK XVI.,"Speedily to the yoke, for him he loved"
13121,BOOK XVI.,"Next to Achilles most, as worthiest found175"
13122,BOOK XVI.,"Of trust, what time the battle loudest roar’d."
13123,BOOK XVI.,Then led Automedon the fiery steeds
13124,BOOK XVI.,"Swift as wing’d tempests to the chariot-yoke,"
13125,BOOK XVI.,Xanthus and Balius. Them the harpy bore
13126,BOOK XVI.,"Podarge, while in meadows green she fed180"
13127,BOOK XVI.,"On Ocean’s side, to Zephyrus the wind."
13128,BOOK XVI.,"To these he added, at their side, a third,"
13129,BOOK XVI.,"The noble Pedasus; him Peleus’ son,"
13130,BOOK XVI.,"Eëtion’s city taken, thence had brought,"
13131,BOOK XVI.,"Though mortal, yet a match for steeds divine.185"
13132,BOOK XVI.,Meantime from every tent Achilles call’d
13133,BOOK XVI.,And arm’d his Myrmidons. As wolves that gorge
13134,BOOK XVI.,"The prey yet panting, terrible in force,"
13135,BOOK XVI.,When on the mountains wild they have devour’d
13136,BOOK XVI.,"An antler’d stag new-slain, with bloody jaws190"
13137,BOOK XVI.,"Troop all at once to some clear fountain, there"
13138,BOOK XVI.,To lap with slender tongues the brimming wave;
13139,BOOK XVI.,"No fears have they, but at their ease eject"
13140,BOOK XVI.,From full maws flatulent the clotted gore;
13141,BOOK XVI.,Such seem’d the Myrmidon heroic Chiefs195
13142,BOOK XVI.,Assembling fast around the valiant friend
13143,BOOK XVI.,Of swift Æacides. Amid them stood
13144,BOOK XVI.,"Warlike Achilles, the well-shielded ranks"
13145,BOOK XVI.,"Exhorting, and the steeds, to glorious war."
13146,BOOK XVI.,The galleys by Achilles dear to Jove200
13147,BOOK XVI.,"Commanded, when to Ilium’s coast he steer’d,"
13148,BOOK XVI.,"Were fifty; fifty rowers sat in each,"
13149,BOOK XVI.,"And five, in whom he trusted, o’er the rest"
13150,BOOK XVI.,"He captains named, but ruled, himself, supreme."
13151,BOOK XVI.,"One band Menestheus swift in battle led,205"
13152,BOOK XVI.,Offspring of Sperchius heaven-descended stream.
13153,BOOK XVI.,"Him Polydora, Peleus’ daughter, bore"
13154,BOOK XVI.,"To ever-flowing Sperchius, compress’d,"
13155,BOOK XVI.,"Although a mortal woman, by a God."
13156,BOOK XVI.,But his reputed father was the son210
13157,BOOK XVI.,"Of Perieres, Borus, who with dower"
13158,BOOK XVI.,"Enrich’d, and made her openly his bride."
13159,BOOK XVI.,Warlike Eudorus led the second band.
13160,BOOK XVI.,"Him Polymela, graceful in the dance,"
13161,BOOK XVI.,"And daughter beautiful of Phylas, bore,215"
13162,BOOK XVI.,A mother unsuspected of a child.
13163,BOOK XVI.,Her worshiping the golden-shafted Queen
13164,BOOK XVI.,"Diana, in full choir, with song and dance,"
13165,BOOK XVI.,The valiant Argicide[6] beheld and loved.
13166,BOOK XVI.,"Ascending with her to an upper room,220"
13167,BOOK XVI.,All-bounteous Mercury[7] clandestine there
13168,BOOK XVI.,"Embraced her, who a noble son produced"
13169,BOOK XVI.,"Eudorus, swift to run, and bold in fight."
13170,BOOK XVI.,"No sooner Ilithya, arbitress"
13171,BOOK XVI.,"Of pangs puerperal, had given him birth,225"
13172,BOOK XVI.,"And he beheld the beaming sun, than her"
13173,BOOK XVI.,"Echechleus, Actor’s mighty son, enrich’d"
13174,BOOK XVI.,"With countless dower, and led her to his home;"
13175,BOOK XVI.,"While ancient Phylas, cherishing her boy"
13176,BOOK XVI.,"With fond affection, reared him as his own.230"
13177,BOOK XVI.,"The third brave troop warlike Pisander led,"
13178,BOOK XVI.,Offspring of Maimalus; he far excell’d
13179,BOOK XVI.,"In spear-fight every Myrmidon, the friend"
13180,BOOK XVI.,Of Peleus’ dauntless son alone except.
13181,BOOK XVI.,The hoary Phœnix of equestrian fame235
13182,BOOK XVI.,"The fourth band led to battle, and the fifth"
13183,BOOK XVI.,"Laërceus’ offspring, bold Alcimedon."
13184,BOOK XVI.,"Thus, all his bands beneath their proper Chiefs"
13185,BOOK XVI.,"Marshall’d, Achilles gave them strict command—"
13186,BOOK XVI.,"Myrmidons! all that vengeance now inflict,240"
13187,BOOK XVI.,Which in this fleet ye ceased not to denounce
13188,BOOK XVI.,Against the Trojans while my wrath endured.
13189,BOOK XVI.,"Me censuring, ye have proclaim’d me oft"
13190,BOOK XVI.,"Obdurate. Oh Achilles! ye have said,"
13191,BOOK XVI.,Thee not with milk thy mother but with bile245
13192,BOOK XVI.,"Suckled, who hold’st thy people here in camp"
13193,BOOK XVI.,Thus long imprison’d. Unrelenting Chief!
13194,BOOK XVI.,Even let us hence in our sea-skimming barks
13195,BOOK XVI.,"To Phthia, since thou can’st not be appeased—"
13196,BOOK XVI.,Thus in full council have ye spoken oft.250
13197,BOOK XVI.,"Now, therefore, since a day of glorious toil"
13198,BOOK XVI.,"At last appears, such as ye have desired,"
13199,BOOK XVI.,There lies the field—go—give your courage proof.
13200,BOOK XVI.,"So them he roused, and they, their leader’s voice"
13201,BOOK XVI.,"Hearing elate, to closest order drew.255"
13202,BOOK XVI.,As when an architect some palace wall
13203,BOOK XVI.,"With shapely stones upbuilds, cementing close"
13204,BOOK XVI.,"A barrier against all the winds of heaven,"
13205,BOOK XVI.,"So wedged, the helmets and boss’d bucklers stood;"
13206,BOOK XVI.,"Shield, helmet, man, press’d helmet, man, and shield,260"
13207,BOOK XVI.,And every bright-arm’d warrior’s bushy crest
13208,BOOK XVI.,"Its fellow swept, so dense was their array."
13209,BOOK XVI.,"In front of all, two Chiefs their station took,"
13210,BOOK XVI.,Patroclus and Automedon; one mind
13211,BOOK XVI.,"In both prevail’d, to combat in the van265"
13212,BOOK XVI.,"Of all the Myrmidons. Achilles, then,"
13213,BOOK XVI.,"Retiring to his tent, displaced the lid"
13214,BOOK XVI.,Of a capacious chest magnificent
13215,BOOK XVI.,By silver-footed Thetis stow’d on board
13216,BOOK XVI.,"His bark, and fill’d with tunics, mantles warm,270"
13217,BOOK XVI.,And gorgeous arras; there he also kept
13218,BOOK XVI.,"Secure a goblet exquisitely wrought,"
13219,BOOK XVI.,"Which never lip touched save his own, and whence"
13220,BOOK XVI.,He offer’d only to the Sire of all.
13221,BOOK XVI.,"That cup producing from the chest, he first275"
13222,BOOK XVI.,"With sulphur fumed it, then with water rinsed"
13223,BOOK XVI.,"Pellucid of the running stream, and, last"
13224,BOOK XVI.,(His hands clean laved) he charged it high with wine.
13225,BOOK XVI.,"And now, advancing to his middle court,"
13226,BOOK XVI.,"He pour’d libation, and with eyes to heaven280"
13227,BOOK XVI.,"Uplifted pray’d,[8] of Jove not unobserved."
13228,BOOK XVI.,"Pelasgian, Dodonæan Jove supreme,"
13229,BOOK XVI.,"Dwelling remote, who on Dodona’s heights"
13230,BOOK XVI.,"Snow-clad reign’st Sovereign, by thy seers around"
13231,BOOK XVI.,"Compass’d the Selli, prophets vow-constrain’d285"
13232,BOOK XVI.,To unwash’d feet and slumbers on the ground!
13233,BOOK XVI.,"Plain I behold my former prayer perform’d,"
13234,BOOK XVI.,"Myself exalted, and the Greeks abased."
13235,BOOK XVI.,"Now also grant me, Jove, this my desire!"
13236,BOOK XVI.,"Here, in my fleet, I shall myself abide,290"
13237,BOOK XVI.,But lo! with all these Myrmidons I send
13238,BOOK XVI.,"My friend to battle. Thunder-rolling Jove,"
13239,BOOK XVI.,"Send glory with him, make his courage firm!"
13240,BOOK XVI.,"That even Hector may himself be taught,"
13241,BOOK XVI.,If my companion have a valiant heart295
13242,BOOK XVI.,"When he goes forth alone, or only then"
13243,BOOK XVI.,The noble frenzy feels that Mars inspires
13244,BOOK XVI.,When I rush also to the glorious field.
13245,BOOK XVI.,But when he shall have driven the battle-shout
13246,BOOK XVI.,"Once from the fleet, grant him with all his arms,300"
13247,BOOK XVI.,"None lost, himself unhurt, and my whole band"
13248,BOOK XVI.,"Of dauntless warriors with him, safe return!"
13249,BOOK XVI.,"Such prayer Achilles offer’d, and his suit"
13250,BOOK XVI.,"Jove hearing, part confirm’d, and part refused;"
13251,BOOK XVI.,To chase the dreadful battle from the fleet305
13252,BOOK XVI.,"He gave him, but vouchsafed him no return."
13253,BOOK XVI.,Prayer and libation thus perform’d to Jove
13254,BOOK XVI.,"The Sire of all, Achilles to his tent"
13255,BOOK XVI.,"Return’d, replaced the goblet in his chest,"
13256,BOOK XVI.,And anxious still that conflict to behold310
13257,BOOK XVI.,"Between the hosts, stood forth before his tent."
13258,BOOK XVI.,"Then rush’d the bands by brave Patroclus led,"
13259,BOOK XVI.,Full on the Trojan host. As wasps forsake
13260,BOOK XVI.,"Their home by the way-side, provoked by boys"
13261,BOOK XVI.,"Disturbing inconsiderate their abode,315"
13262,BOOK XVI.,"Not without nuisance sore to all who pass,"
13263,BOOK XVI.,"For if, thenceforth, some traveller unaware"
13264,BOOK XVI.,"Annoy them, issuing one and all they swarm"
13265,BOOK XVI.,"Around him, fearless in their broods’ defence,"
13266,BOOK XVI.,So issued from their fleet the Myrmidons320
13267,BOOK XVI.,"Undaunted; clamor infinite arose,"
13268,BOOK XVI.,And thus Patroclus loud his host address’d.
13269,BOOK XVI.,"Oh Myrmidons, attendants in the field"
13270,BOOK XVI.,"On Peleus’ son, now be ye men, my friends!"
13271,BOOK XVI.,Call now to mind the fury of your might;325
13272,BOOK XVI.,"That we, close-fighting servants of the Chief"
13273,BOOK XVI.,"Most excellent in all the camp of Greece,"
13274,BOOK XVI.,"May glory gain for him, and that the wide-"
13275,BOOK XVI.,"Commanding Agamemnon, Atreus’ son,"
13276,BOOK XVI.,"May learn his fault, that he dishonor’d foul330"
13277,BOOK XVI.,The prince in whom Achaia glories most.
13278,BOOK XVI.,"So saying he fired their hearts, and on the van"
13279,BOOK XVI.,Of Troy at once they fell; loud shouted all
13280,BOOK XVI.,"The joyful Grecians, and the navy rang."
13281,BOOK XVI.,"Then, soon as Ilium’s host the valiant son335"
13282,BOOK XVI.,Saw of Menœtius and his charioteer
13283,BOOK XVI.,"In dazzling armor clad, all courage lost,"
13284,BOOK XVI.,"Their closest ranks gave way, believing sure"
13285,BOOK XVI.,"That, wrath renounced, and terms of friendship chosen,"
13286,BOOK XVI.,"Achilles’ self was there; thus thinking, each340"
13287,BOOK XVI.,Look’d every way for refuge from his fate.
13288,BOOK XVI.,"Patroclus first, where thickest throng he saw"
13289,BOOK XVI.,Gather’d tumultuous around the bark
13290,BOOK XVI.,"Of brave Protesilaüs, hurl’d direct"
13291,BOOK XVI.,At the whole multitude his glittering spear.345
13292,BOOK XVI.,He smote Pyræchmes; he his horsemen band
13293,BOOK XVI.,"Pœonian led from Amydon, and from"
13294,BOOK XVI.,Broad-flowing Axius. In his shoulder stood
13295,BOOK XVI.,"The spear, and with loud groans supine he fell."
13296,BOOK XVI.,"At once fled all his followers, on all sides350"
13297,BOOK XVI.,"With consternation fill’d, seeing their Chief"
13298,BOOK XVI.,"And their best warrior, by Patroclus slain."
13299,BOOK XVI.,"Forth from the fleet he drove them, quench’d the flames,"
13300,BOOK XVI.,And rescued half the ship. Then scatter’d fled
13301,BOOK XVI.,"With infinite uproar the host of Troy,355"
13302,BOOK XVI.,While from between their ships the Danaï
13303,BOOK XVI.,"Pour’d after them, and hideous rout ensued."
13304,BOOK XVI.,"As when the king of lightnings, Jove, dispels"
13305,BOOK XVI.,"From some huge eminence a gloomy cloud,"
13306,BOOK XVI.,"The groves, the mountain-tops, the headland heights360"
13307,BOOK XVI.,"Shine all, illumined from the boundless heaven,"
13308,BOOK XVI.,So when the Danaï those hostile fires
13309,BOOK XVI.,"Had from their fleet expell’d, awhile they breathed,"
13310,BOOK XVI.,"Yet found short respite, for the battle yet"
13311,BOOK XVI.,"Ceased not, nor fled the Trojans in all parts365"
13312,BOOK XVI.,"Alike, but still resisted, from the ships"
13313,BOOK XVI.,Retiring through necessity alone.
13314,BOOK XVI.,"Then, in that scatter’d warfare, every Chief"
13315,BOOK XVI.,Slew one. While Areïlochus his back
13316,BOOK XVI.,"Turn’d on Patroclus, sudden with a lance370"
13317,BOOK XVI.,"His thigh he pierced, and urged the weapon through,"
13318,BOOK XVI.,Shivering the bone; he headlong smote the ground.
13319,BOOK XVI.,"The hero Menelaus, where he saw"
13320,BOOK XVI.,The breast of Thoas by his slanting shield
13321,BOOK XVI.,"Unguarded, struck and stretch’d him at his feet.375"
13322,BOOK XVI.,"Phylides,[9] meeting with preventive spear"
13323,BOOK XVI.,"The furious onset of Amphiclus, gash’d"
13324,BOOK XVI.,"His leg below the knee, where brawny most"
13325,BOOK XVI.,The muscles swell in man; disparted wide
13326,BOOK XVI.,"The tendons shrank, and darkness veil’d his eyes.380"
13327,BOOK XVI.,The two Nestoridæ slew each a Chief.
13328,BOOK XVI.,"Of these, Antilochus Atymnius pierced"
13329,BOOK XVI.,"Right through his flank, and at his feet he fell."
13330,BOOK XVI.,With fierce resentment fired Maris beheld
13331,BOOK XVI.,"His brother’s fall, and guarding, spear in hand,385"
13332,BOOK XVI.,"The slain, impetuous on the conqueror flew;"
13333,BOOK XVI.,But godlike Thrasymedes[10] wounded first
13334,BOOK XVI.,"Maris, ere he Antilochus; he pierced"
13335,BOOK XVI.,"His upper arm, and with the lance’s point"
13336,BOOK XVI.,Rent off and stript the muscles to the bone.390
13337,BOOK XVI.,"Sounding he fell, and darkness veil’d his eyes."
13338,BOOK XVI.,"They thus, two brothers by two brothers slain,"
13339,BOOK XVI.,"Went down to Erebus, associates both"
13340,BOOK XVI.,"Of brave Sarpedon, and spear-practised sons"
13341,BOOK XVI.,Of Amisodarus; of him who fed395
13342,BOOK XVI.,"Chimæra,[11] monster, by whom many died."
13343,BOOK XVI.,"Ajax the swift on Cleobulus sprang,"
13344,BOOK XVI.,"Whom while he toil’d entangled in the crowd,"
13345,BOOK XVI.,"He seized alive, but smote him where he stood"
13346,BOOK XVI.,With his huge-hafted sword full on the neck;400
13347,BOOK XVI.,"The blood warm’d all his blade, and ruthless fate"
13348,BOOK XVI.,Benighted dark the dying warrior’s eyes.
13349,BOOK XVI.,Peneleus into close contention rush’d
13350,BOOK XVI.,"And Lycon. Each had hurl’d his glittering spear,"
13351,BOOK XVI.,"But each in vain, and now with swords they met.405"
13352,BOOK XVI.,"He smote Peneleus on the crested casque,"
13353,BOOK XVI.,But snapp’d his falchion; him Peneleus smote
13354,BOOK XVI.,Beneath his ear; the whole blade entering sank
13355,BOOK XVI.,"Into his neck, and Lycon with his head"
13356,BOOK XVI.,"Depending by the skin alone, expired.410"
13357,BOOK XVI.,Meriones o’ertaking Acamas
13358,BOOK XVI.,"Ere yet he could ascend his chariot, thrust"
13359,BOOK XVI.,A lance into his shoulder; down he fell
13360,BOOK XVI.,In dreary death’s eternal darkness whelm’d.
13361,BOOK XVI.,Idomeneus his ruthless spear enforced415
13362,BOOK XVI.,Into the mouth of Erymas. The point
13363,BOOK XVI.,"Stay’d not, but gliding close beneath the brain,"
13364,BOOK XVI.,"Transpierced his spine,[12] and started forth beyond."
13365,BOOK XVI.,"It wrench’d his teeth, and fill’d his eyes with blood;"
13366,BOOK XVI.,Blood also blowing through his open mouth420
13367,BOOK XVI.,"And nostrils, to the realms of death he pass’d."
13368,BOOK XVI.,"Thus slew these Grecian leaders, each, a foe."
13369,BOOK XVI.,Sudden as hungry wolves the kids purloin
13370,BOOK XVI.,"Or lambs, which haply some unheeding swain"
13371,BOOK XVI.,Hath left to roam at large the mountains wild;425
13372,BOOK XVI.,"They, seeing, snatch them from beside the dams,"
13373,BOOK XVI.,"And rend incontinent the feeble prey,"
13374,BOOK XVI.,So swift the Danaï the host assail’d
13375,BOOK XVI.,"Of Ilium; they, into tumultuous flight"
13376,BOOK XVI.,"Together driven, all hope, all courage lost.430"
13377,BOOK XVI.,Huge Ajax ceaseless sought his spear to cast
13378,BOOK XVI.,"At Hector brazen-mail’d, who, not untaught"
13379,BOOK XVI.,"The warrior’s art, with bull-hide buckler stood"
13380,BOOK XVI.,"Sheltering his ample shoulders, while he mark’d"
13381,BOOK XVI.,The hiss of flying shafts and crash of spears.435
13382,BOOK XVI.,Full sure he saw the shifting course of war
13383,BOOK XVI.,"Now turn’d, but scorning flight, bent all his thoughts"
13384,BOOK XVI.,To rescue yet the remnant of his friends.
13385,BOOK XVI.,As when the Thunderer spreads a sable storm
13386,BOOK XVI.,"O’er ether, late serene, the cloud that wrapp’d440"
13387,BOOK XVI.,"Olympus’ head escapes into the skies,"
13388,BOOK XVI.,So fled the Trojans from the fleet of Greece
13389,BOOK XVI.,"Clamoring in their flight, nor pass’d the trench"
13390,BOOK XVI.,In fair array; the coursers fleet indeed
13391,BOOK XVI.,"Of Hector, him bore safe with all his arms445"
13392,BOOK XVI.,"Right through, but in the foss entangled foul"
13393,BOOK XVI.,"He left his host, and struggling to escape."
13394,BOOK XVI.,"Then many a chariot-whirling steed, the pole"
13395,BOOK XVI.,"Broken at its extremity, forsook"
13396,BOOK XVI.,"His driver, while Patroclus with the shout450"
13397,BOOK XVI.,"Of battle calling his Achaians on,"
13398,BOOK XVI.,Destruction purposed to the powers of Troy.
13399,BOOK XVI.,"They, once dispersed, with clamor and with flight"
13400,BOOK XVI.,"Fill’d all the ways, the dust beneath the clouds"
13401,BOOK XVI.,"Hung like a tempest, and the steeds firm-hoof’d455"
13402,BOOK XVI.,Whirl’d off at stretch the chariots to the town.
13403,BOOK XVI.,"He, wheresoe’er most troubled he perceived"
13404,BOOK XVI.,"The routed host, loud-threatening thither drove,"
13405,BOOK XVI.,While under his own axle many a Chief
13406,BOOK XVI.,"Fell prone, and the o’ertumbled chariots rang.460"
13407,BOOK XVI.,Right o’er the hollow foss the coursers leap’d
13408,BOOK XVI.,"Immortal, by the Gods to Peleus given,"
13409,BOOK XVI.,"Impatient for the plain, nor less desire"
13410,BOOK XVI.,"Felt he who drove to smite the Trojan Chief,"
13411,BOOK XVI.,But him his fiery steeds caught swift away.465
13412,BOOK XVI.,As when a tempest from autumnal skies
13413,BOOK XVI.,"Floats all the fields, what time Jove heaviest pours"
13414,BOOK XVI.,"Impetuous rain, token of wrath divine"
13415,BOOK XVI.,"Against perverters of the laws by force,"
13416,BOOK XVI.,"Who drive forth justice, reckless of the Gods;470"
13417,BOOK XVI.,"The rivers and the torrents, where they dwell,"
13418,BOOK XVI.,"Sweep many a green declivity away,"
13419,BOOK XVI.,"And plunge at length, groaning, into the Deep"
13420,BOOK XVI.,"From the hills headlong, leaving where they pass’d"
13421,BOOK XVI.,"No traces of the pleasant works of man,475"
13422,BOOK XVI.,"So, in their flight, loud groan’d the steeds of Troy."
13423,BOOK XVI.,"And now, their foremost intercepted all,"
13424,BOOK XVI.,Patroclus back again toward the fleet
13425,BOOK XVI.,"Drove them precipitate, nor the ascent"
13426,BOOK XVI.,"Permitted them to Troy for which they strove,480"
13427,BOOK XVI.,But in the midway space between the ships
13428,BOOK XVI.,The river and the lofty Trojan wall
13429,BOOK XVI.,"Pursued them ardent, slaughtering whom he reached,"
13430,BOOK XVI.,And vengeance took for many a Grecian slain.
13431,BOOK XVI.,"First then, with glittering spear the breast he pierced485"
13432,BOOK XVI.,"Of Pronöus, undefended by his shield,"
13433,BOOK XVI.,And stretch’d him dead; loud rang his batter’d arms.
13434,BOOK XVI.,"The son of Enops, Thestor next he smote."
13435,BOOK XVI.,He on his chariot-seat magnificent
13436,BOOK XVI.,"Low-cowering sat, a fear-distracted form,490"
13437,BOOK XVI.,And from his palsied grasp the reins had fallen.
13438,BOOK XVI.,"Then came Patroclus nigh, and through his cheek"
13439,BOOK XVI.,"His teeth transpiercing, drew him by his lance"
13440,BOOK XVI.,Sheer o’er the chariot front. As when a man
13441,BOOK XVI.,"On some projecting rock seated, with line495"
13442,BOOK XVI.,"And splendid hook draws forth a sea-fish huge,"
13443,BOOK XVI.,So him wide-gaping from his seat he drew
13444,BOOK XVI.,"At his spear-point, then shook him to the ground"
13445,BOOK XVI.,"Prone on his face, where gasping he expired."
13446,BOOK XVI.,"At Eryalus, next, advancing swift500"
13447,BOOK XVI.,He hurl’d a rock; full on the middle front
13448,BOOK XVI.,"He smote him, and within the ponderous casque"
13449,BOOK XVI.,His whole head open’d into equal halves.
13450,BOOK XVI.,"With deadliest night surrounded, prone he fell."
13451,BOOK XVI.,"Epaltes, Erymas, Amphoterus,505"
13452,BOOK XVI.,"Echius, Tlepolemus Damastor’s son,"
13453,BOOK XVI.,"Evippus, Ipheus, Pyres, Polymelus,"
13454,BOOK XVI.,"All these he on the champain, corse on corse"
13455,BOOK XVI.,"Promiscuous flung. Sarpedon, when he saw"
13456,BOOK XVI.,Such havoc made of his uncinctured[13] friends510
13457,BOOK XVI.,"By Menœtiades, with sharp rebuke"
13458,BOOK XVI.,His band of godlike Lycians loud address’d.
13459,BOOK XVI.,"Shame on you, Lycians! whither would ye fly?"
13460,BOOK XVI.,Now are ye swift indeed! I will oppose
13461,BOOK XVI.,"Myself this conqueror, that I may learn515"
13462,BOOK XVI.,"Who thus afflicts the Trojan host, of life"
13463,BOOK XVI.,Bereaving numerous of their warriors bold.
13464,BOOK XVI.,"He said, and with his arms leap’d to the ground."
13465,BOOK XVI.,"On the other side, Patroclus at that sight"
13466,BOOK XVI.,Sprang from his chariot. As two vultures clash520
13467,BOOK XVI.,"Bow-beak’d, crook-talon’d, on some lofty rock"
13468,BOOK XVI.,"Clamoring both, so they together rush’d"
13469,BOOK XVI.,With clamors loud; whom when the son observed
13470,BOOK XVI.,"Of wily Saturn, with compassion moved"
13471,BOOK XVI.,His sister and his spouse he thus bespake.525
13472,BOOK XVI.,"Alas, he falls! my most beloved of men"
13473,BOOK XVI.,"Sarpedon, vanquished by Patroclus, falls!"
13474,BOOK XVI.,"So will the Fates. Yet, doubtful, much I muse"
13475,BOOK XVI.,"Whether to place him, snatch’d from furious fight"
13476,BOOK XVI.,"In Lycia’s wealthy realm, or to permit530"
13477,BOOK XVI.,His death by valiant Menœtiades.
13478,BOOK XVI.,"To whom his awful spouse, displeased, replied."
13479,BOOK XVI.,How speaks the terrible Saturnian Jove!
13480,BOOK XVI.,Wouldst thou again from pangs of death exempt
13481,BOOK XVI.,"A mortal man, destined long since to die?535"
13482,BOOK XVI.,"Do it. But small thy praise shall be in heaven,"
13483,BOOK XVI.,"Mark thou my words, and in thy inmost breast"
13484,BOOK XVI.,Treasure them. If thou send Sarpedon safe
13485,BOOK XVI.,"To his own home, how many Gods _their_ sons"
13486,BOOK XVI.,May also send from battle? Weigh it well.540
13487,BOOK XVI.,For under yon great city fight no few
13488,BOOK XVI.,Sprung from Immortals whom thou shalt provoke.
13489,BOOK XVI.,"But if thou love him, and thine heart his lot"
13490,BOOK XVI.,"Commiserate, leave him by the hands to fall"
13491,BOOK XVI.,Of Menœtiades in conflict dire;545
13492,BOOK XVI.,But give command to Death and gentle Sleep
13493,BOOK XVI.,That him of life bereft at once they bear
13494,BOOK XVI.,"To Lycia’s ample realm,[14] where, with due rites"
13495,BOOK XVI.,"Funereal, his next kindred and his friends"
13496,BOOK XVI.,"Shall honor him, a pillar and a tomb550"
13497,BOOK XVI.,(The dead man’s portion) rearing to his name.
13498,BOOK XVI.,"She said, from whom the Sire of Gods and men"
13499,BOOK XVI.,"Dissented not, but on the earth distill’d"
13500,BOOK XVI.,A sanguine shower in honor of a son
13501,BOOK XVI.,"Dear to him, whom Patroclus on the field555"
13502,BOOK XVI.,"Of fruitful Troy should slay, far from his home."
13503,BOOK XVI.,"Opposite now, small interval between,"
13504,BOOK XVI.,Those heroes stood. Patroclus at his waist
13505,BOOK XVI.,Pierced Thrasymelus the illustrious friend
13506,BOOK XVI.,"Of King Sarpedon, and his charioteer.560"
13507,BOOK XVI.,"Spear’d through the lower bowels, dead he fell."
13508,BOOK XVI.,"Then hurl’d Sarpedon in his turn a lance,"
13509,BOOK XVI.,But miss’d Patroclus and the shoulder pierced
13510,BOOK XVI.,Of Pedasus the horse; he groaning heaved
13511,BOOK XVI.,"His spirit forth, and fallen on the field565"
13512,BOOK XVI.,In long loud moanings sorrowful expired.
13513,BOOK XVI.,Wide started the immortal pair; the yoke
13514,BOOK XVI.,"Creak’d, and entanglement of reins ensued"
13515,BOOK XVI.,"To both, their fellow slaughter’d at their side."
13516,BOOK XVI.,That mischief soon Automedon redress’d.570
13517,BOOK XVI.,"He rose, and from beside his sturdy thigh"
13518,BOOK XVI.,"Drawing his falchion, with effectual stroke"
13519,BOOK XVI.,Cut loose the side-horse; then the pair reduced
13520,BOOK XVI.,"To order, in their traces stood composed,"
13521,BOOK XVI.,And the two heroes fierce engaged again.575
13522,BOOK XVI.,"Again his radiant spear Sarpedon hurl’d,"
13523,BOOK XVI.,"But miss’d Patroclus; the innocuous point,"
13524,BOOK XVI.,"O’erflying his left shoulder, pass’d beyond."
13525,BOOK XVI.,Then with bright lance Patroclus in his turn
13526,BOOK XVI.,"Assail’d Sarpedon, nor with erring course580"
13527,BOOK XVI.,"The weapon sped or vain, but pierced profound"
13528,BOOK XVI.,"His chest, enclosure of the guarded heart."
13529,BOOK XVI.,"As falls an oak, poplar, or lofty pine"
13530,BOOK XVI.,With new-edged axes on the mountains hewn
13531,BOOK XVI.,"Right through, for structure of some gallant bark,585"
13532,BOOK XVI.,So fell Sarpedon stretch’d his steeds before
13533,BOOK XVI.,"And gnash’d his teeth and clutch’d the bloody dust,"
13534,BOOK XVI.,And as a lion slays a tawny bull
13535,BOOK XVI.,Leader magnanimous of all the herd;
13536,BOOK XVI.,Beneath the lion’s jaws groaning he dies;590
13537,BOOK XVI.,"So, leader of the shielded Lycians groan’d"
13538,BOOK XVI.,"Indignant, by Patroclus slain, the bold"
13539,BOOK XVI.,"Sarpedon, and his friend thus, sad, bespake."
13540,BOOK XVI.,"Glaucus, my friend, among these warring Chiefs"
13541,BOOK XVI.,Thyself a Chief illustrious! thou hast need595
13542,BOOK XVI.,"Of all thy valor now; now strenuous fight,"
13543,BOOK XVI.,"And, if thou bear within thee a brave mind,"
13544,BOOK XVI.,Now make the war’s calamities thy joy.
13545,BOOK XVI.,"First, marching through the host of Lycia, rouse"
13546,BOOK XVI.,"Our Chiefs to combat for Sarpedon slain,600"
13547,BOOK XVI.,"Then haste, thyself, to battle for thy friend."
13548,BOOK XVI.,For shame and foul dishonor which no time
13549,BOOK XVI.,"Shall e’er obliterate, I must prove to thee,"
13550,BOOK XVI.,Should the Achaians of my glorious arms
13551,BOOK XVI.,Despoil me in full prospect[15] of the fleet.605
13552,BOOK XVI.,"Fight, therefore, thou, and others urge to fight."
13553,BOOK XVI.,"He said, and cover’d by the night of death,"
13554,BOOK XVI.,Nor look’d nor breath’d again; for on his chest
13555,BOOK XVI.,"Implanting firm his heel, Patroclus drew"
13556,BOOK XVI.,"The spear enfolded with his vitals forth,610"
13557,BOOK XVI.,Weapon and life at once. Meantime his steeds
13558,BOOK XVI.,"Snorted, by Myrmidons detain’d, and, loosed"
13559,BOOK XVI.,"From their own master’s chariot, foam’d to fly."
13560,BOOK XVI.,"Terrible was the grief by Glaucus felt,"
13561,BOOK XVI.,"Hearing that charge, and troubled was his heart615"
13562,BOOK XVI.,That all power fail’d him to protect the dead.
13563,BOOK XVI.,"Compressing his own arm he stood, with pain"
13564,BOOK XVI.,Extreme tormented which the shaft had caused
13565,BOOK XVI.,"Of Teucer, who while Glaucus climb’d the wall,"
13566,BOOK XVI.,"Had pierced him from it, in the fleet’s defence.620"
13567,BOOK XVI.,"Then, thus, to Phœbus, King shaft-arm’d, he pray’d."
13568,BOOK XVI.,"Hear now, O King! For whether in the land"
13569,BOOK XVI.,"Of wealthy Lycia dwelling, or in Troy,"
13570,BOOK XVI.,Thou hear’st in every place alike the prayer
13571,BOOK XVI.,"Of the afflicted heart, and such is mine;625"
13572,BOOK XVI.,Behold my wound; it fills my useless hand
13573,BOOK XVI.,"With anguish, neither can my blood be stay’d,"
13574,BOOK XVI.,And all my shoulder suffers. I can grasp
13575,BOOK XVI.,"A spear, or rush to conflict with the Greeks"
13576,BOOK XVI.,No longer now; and we have also lost630
13577,BOOK XVI.,"Our noblest Chief, Sarpedon, son of Jove,"
13578,BOOK XVI.,"Who guards not his own son. But thou, O King!"
13579,BOOK XVI.,"Heal me, assuage my anguish, give me strength,"
13580,BOOK XVI.,That I may animate the Lycian host
13581,BOOK XVI.,"To fight, and may, myself, defend the dead!635"
13582,BOOK XVI.,"Such prayer he offer’d, whom Apollo heard;"
13583,BOOK XVI.,"He eased at once his pain, the sable blood"
13584,BOOK XVI.,"Staunch’d, and his soul with vigor new inspired."
13585,BOOK XVI.,Then Glaucus in his heart that prayer perceived
13586,BOOK XVI.,"Granted, and joyful for the sudden aid640"
13587,BOOK XVI.,"Vouchsafed to him by Phœbus, first the lines"
13588,BOOK XVI.,"Of Lycia ranged, summoning every Chief"
13589,BOOK XVI.,To fight for slain Sarpedon; striding next
13590,BOOK XVI.,"With eager haste into the ranks of Troy,"
13591,BOOK XVI.,Renown’d Agenor and the son he call’d645
13592,BOOK XVI.,"Of Panthus, brave Polydamas, with whom"
13593,BOOK XVI.,"Æneas also, and approaching last"
13594,BOOK XVI.,To Hector brazen-mail’d him thus bespake.
13595,BOOK XVI.,"Now, Hector! now, thou hast indeed resign’d"
13596,BOOK XVI.,"All care of thy allies, who, for thy sake,650"
13597,BOOK XVI.,"Lost both to friends and country, on these plains"
13598,BOOK XVI.,"Perish, unaided and unmiss’d by thee."
13599,BOOK XVI.,"Sarpedon breathless lies, who led to fight"
13600,BOOK XVI.,"Our shielded bands, and from whose just control"
13601,BOOK XVI.,And courage Lycia drew her chief defence.655
13602,BOOK XVI.,Him brazen Mars hath by the spear subdued
13603,BOOK XVI.,Of Menœtiades. But stand ye firm!
13604,BOOK XVI.,"Let indignation fire you, O my friends!"
13605,BOOK XVI.,"Lest, stripping him of his resplendent arms,"
13606,BOOK XVI.,The Myrmidons with foul dishonor shame660
13607,BOOK XVI.,"His body, through resentment of the deaths"
13608,BOOK XVI.,Of numerous Grecians slain by spears of ours.
13609,BOOK XVI.,He ceased; then sorrow every Trojan heart
13610,BOOK XVI.,Seized insupportable and that disdain’d
13611,BOOK XVI.,"All bounds, for that, although a stranger born,665"
13612,BOOK XVI.,Sarpedon ever had a bulwark proved
13613,BOOK XVI.,"To Troy, the leader of a numerous host,"
13614,BOOK XVI.,And of that host by none in fight excell’d.
13615,BOOK XVI.,Right on toward the Danaï they moved
13616,BOOK XVI.,"Ardent for battle all, and at their head670"
13617,BOOK XVI.,"Enraged for slain Sarpedon, Hector came."
13618,BOOK XVI.,"Meantime, stout-hearted[16] Chief, Patroclus roused"
13619,BOOK XVI.,"The Grecians, and exhorting first (themselves"
13620,BOOK XVI.,"Already prompt) the Ajaces, thus began."
13621,BOOK XVI.,Heroic pair! now make it all your joy675
13622,BOOK XVI.,"To chase the Trojan host, and such to prove"
13623,BOOK XVI.,"As erst, or even bolder, if ye may."
13624,BOOK XVI.,The Chief lies breathless who ascended first
13625,BOOK XVI.,"Our wall, Sarpedon. Let us bear him hence,"
13626,BOOK XVI.,"Strip and dishonor him, and in the blood680"
13627,BOOK XVI.,Of his protectors drench the ruthless spear.
13628,BOOK XVI.,"So Menœtiades his warriors urged,"
13629,BOOK XVI.,Themselves courageous. Then the Lycian host
13630,BOOK XVI.,"And Trojan here, and there the Myrmidons"
13631,BOOK XVI.,"With all the host of Greece, closing the ranks685"
13632,BOOK XVI.,"Rush’d into furious contest for the dead,"
13633,BOOK XVI.,"Shouting tremendous; clang’d their brazen arms,"
13634,BOOK XVI.,And Jove with Night’s pernicious shades[17] o’erhung
13635,BOOK XVI.,"The bloody field, so to enhance the more"
13636,BOOK XVI.,Their toilsome strife for his own son. First then690
13637,BOOK XVI.,The Trojans from their place and order shock’d
13638,BOOK XVI.,"The bright-eyed Grecians, slaying not the least"
13639,BOOK XVI.,"Nor worst among the Myrmidons, the brave"
13640,BOOK XVI.,Epigeus from renown’d Agacles sprung.
13641,BOOK XVI.,"He, erst, in populous Budeum ruled,695"
13642,BOOK XVI.,But for a valiant kinsman of his own
13643,BOOK XVI.,"Whom there he slew, had thence to Peleus fled"
13644,BOOK XVI.,"And to his silver-footed spouse divine,"
13645,BOOK XVI.,"Who with Achilles, phalanx-breaker Chief,"
13646,BOOK XVI.,Sent him to fight beneath the walls of Troy.700
13647,BOOK XVI.,"Him seizing fast the body, with a stone"
13648,BOOK XVI.,"Illustrious Hector smote full on the front,"
13649,BOOK XVI.,And his whole skull within the ponderous casque
13650,BOOK XVI.,Split sheer; he prostrate on the body fell
13651,BOOK XVI.,In shades of soul-divorcing death involved.705
13652,BOOK XVI.,"Patroclus, grieving for his slaughter’d friend,"
13653,BOOK XVI.,Rush’d through the foremost warriors. As the hawk
13654,BOOK XVI.,"Swift-wing’d before him starlings drives or daws,"
13655,BOOK XVI.,"So thou, Patroclus, of equestrian fame!"
13656,BOOK XVI.,"Full on the Lycian ranks and Trojan drov’st,710"
13657,BOOK XVI.,Resentful of thy fellow-warrior’s fall.
13658,BOOK XVI.,"At Sthenelaüs a huge stone he cast,"
13659,BOOK XVI.,"Son of Ithæmenes, whom on the neck"
13660,BOOK XVI.,He smote and burst the tendons; then the van
13661,BOOK XVI.,"Of Ilium’s host, with Hector, all retired.715"
13662,BOOK XVI.,Far as the slender javelin cuts the air
13663,BOOK XVI.,"Hurl’d with collected force, or in the games,"
13664,BOOK XVI.,"Or even in battle at a desperate foe,"
13665,BOOK XVI.,So far the Greeks repulsed the host of Troy.
13666,BOOK XVI.,"Then Glaucus first, Chief of the shielded bands720"
13667,BOOK XVI.,"Of Lycia, slew Bathycles, valiant son"
13668,BOOK XVI.,"Of Calchon; Hellas was his home, and far"
13669,BOOK XVI.,He pass’d in riches all the Myrmidons.
13670,BOOK XVI.,"Him chasing Glaucus whom he now attain’d,"
13671,BOOK XVI.,"The Lycian, turning sudden, with his lance725"
13672,BOOK XVI.,"Pierced through the breast, and, sounding, down he fell"
13673,BOOK XVI.,Grief fill’d Achaia’s sons for such a Chief
13674,BOOK XVI.,"So slain, but joy the Trojans; thick they throng’d"
13675,BOOK XVI.,"The conqueror around, nor yet the Greeks"
13676,BOOK XVI.,"Forgat their force, but resolute advanced.730"
13677,BOOK XVI.,"Then, by Meriones a Trojan died"
13678,BOOK XVI.,"Of noble rank, Laogonus, the son"
13679,BOOK XVI.,"Undaunted of Onetor great in Troy,"
13680,BOOK XVI.,Priest of Idæan Jove. The ear and jaw
13681,BOOK XVI.,"Between, he pierced him with a mortal force;735"
13682,BOOK XVI.,"Swift flew the life, and darkness veil’d his eyes."
13683,BOOK XVI.,"Æneas, in return, his brazen spear"
13684,BOOK XVI.,Hurl’d at Meriones with ardent hope
13685,BOOK XVI.,"To pierce him, while, with nimble[18] steps and short"
13686,BOOK XVI.,"Behind his buckler made, he paced the field;740"
13687,BOOK XVI.,"But, warn’d of its approach, Meriones"
13688,BOOK XVI.,"Bow’d low his head, shunning it, and the spear"
13689,BOOK XVI.,Behind him pierced the soil; there quivering stood
13690,BOOK XVI.,"The weapon, vain, though from a vigorous arm,"
13691,BOOK XVI.,Till spent by slow degrees its fury slept.745
13692,BOOK XVI.,*       *       *       *       *
13693,BOOK XVI.,*       *       *       *       *[19]
13694,BOOK XVI.,Indignant then Æneas thus exclaim’d.
13695,BOOK XVI.,
13696,BOOK XVI.,Meriones! I sent thee such a spear
13697,BOOK XVI.,"As reaching thee, should have for ever marr’d750"
13698,BOOK XVI.,"Thy step, accomplish’d dancer as thou art."
13699,BOOK XVI.,To whom Meriones spear-famed replied.
13700,BOOK XVI.,Æneas! thou wilt find the labor hard
13701,BOOK XVI.,"How great soe’er thy might, to quell the force"
13702,BOOK XVI.,Of all opposers. Thou art also doom’d755
13703,BOOK XVI.,Thyself to die; and may but spear of mine
13704,BOOK XVI.,"Well-aim’d once strike thee full, what strength soe’er"
13705,BOOK XVI.,"Or magnanimity be thine to boast,"
13706,BOOK XVI.,Thy glory in that moment thou resign’st
13707,BOOK XVI.,"To me, thy soul to Pluto steed-renown’d.760"
13708,BOOK XVI.,"He said, but him Patroclus sharp reproved."
13709,BOOK XVI.,"Why speaks Meriones, although in fight"
13710,BOOK XVI.,"Approved, thus proudly? Nay, my gallant friend!"
13711,BOOK XVI.,The Trojans will not for reproach of ours
13712,BOOK XVI.,Renounce the body. Blood must first be spilt.765
13713,BOOK XVI.,"Tongues in debate, but hands in war decide;"
13714,BOOK XVI.,"Deeds therefore now, not wordy vaunts, we need."
13715,BOOK XVI.,"So saying he led the way, whom follow’d close"
13716,BOOK XVI.,Godlike Meriones. As from the depth
13717,BOOK XVI.,Of some lone wood that clothes the mountain’s side770
13718,BOOK XVI.,"The fellers at their toil are heard remote,"
13719,BOOK XVI.,"So, from the face of Ilium’s ample plain"
13720,BOOK XVI.,"Reverberated, was the din of brass"
13721,BOOK XVI.,And of tough targets heard by falchions huge
13722,BOOK XVI.,"Hard-smitten, and by spears of double-edge.775"
13723,BOOK XVI.,"None then, no, not the quickest to discern,"
13724,BOOK XVI.,"Had known divine Sarpedon, from his head"
13725,BOOK XVI.,To his foot-sole with mingled blood and dust
13726,BOOK XVI.,"Polluted, and o’erwhelm’d with weapons. They"
13727,BOOK XVI.,Around the body swarm’d. As hovel-flies780
13728,BOOK XVI.,In spring-time buzz around the brimming pails
13729,BOOK XVI.,"With milk bedew’d, so they around the dead."
13730,BOOK XVI.,Nor Jove averted once his glorious eyes

13734,BOOK XVI.,Hector should even now slay on divine
13735,BOOK XVI.,"Sarpedon, and despoil him of his arms,"
13736,BOOK XVI.,Or he should still that arduous strife prolong.
13737,BOOK XVI.,This counsel gain’d as eligible most790
13738,BOOK XVI.,At length his preference: that the valiant friend
13739,BOOK XVI.,Of Peleus’ son should yet again compel
13740,BOOK XVI.,The Trojan host with Hector brazen-mail’d
13741,BOOK XVI.,"To Ilium, slaughtering numerous by the way."
13742,BOOK XVI.,"First then, with fears unmanly he possess’d795"
13743,BOOK XVI.,The heart of Hector; mounting to his seat
13744,BOOK XVI.,"He turn’d to flight himself, and bade his host"
13745,BOOK XVI.,Fly also; for he knew Jove’s purpose[20] changed.

13770,BOOK XVI.,"Descending swift into the dreadful field,"
13771,BOOK XVI.,Godlike Sarpedon’s body from beneath

13823,BOOK XVI.,"Apollo, so disguised, him thus bespake."
13824,BOOK XVI.,"Why, Hector, hast thou left the fight? this sloth"

13831,BOOK XVI.,"So saying, Apollo join’d the host again."
13832,BOOK XVI.,Then noble Hector bade his charioteer885

13838,BOOK XVI.,"But Hector, leaving all beside unslain,"
13839,BOOK XVI.,Furious impell’d his coursers solid-hoof’d
13840,BOOK XVI.,Against Patroclus; on the other side
13841,BOOK XVI.,Patroclus from his chariot to the ground
13842,BOOK XVI.,"Leap’d ardent; in his left a spear he bore,895"
13843,BOOK XVI.,"And in his right a marble fragment rough,"
13844,BOOK XVI.,Large as his grasp. With full collected might
13845,BOOK XVI.,He hurl’d it; neither was the weapon slow
13846,BOOK XVI.,"To whom he had mark’d, or sent in vain."
13847,BOOK XVI.,"He smote the charioteer of Hector, bold900"
13848,BOOK XVI.,"Cebriones, King Priam’s spurious son,"

13850,BOOK XVI.,"The bone that force withstood not, but the rock"

13853,BOOK XVI.,"He diver-like, from his exalted stand"
13854,BOOK XVI.,"Behind the steeds pitch’d headlong, and expired;"
13855,BOOK XVI.,"O’er whom, Patroclus of equestrian fame!"
13856,BOOK XVI.,Thou didst exult with taunting speech severe.
13857,BOOK XVI.,"Ye Gods, with what agility he dives!910"
13858,BOOK XVI.,Ah! it were well if in the fishy deep
13859,BOOK XVI.,This man were occupied; he might no few
13860,BOOK XVI.,"With oysters satisfy, although the waves"
13861,BOOK XVI.,"Were churlish, plunging headlong from his bark"
13862,BOOK XVI.,As easily as from his chariot here.915
13863,BOOK XVI.,"So then—in Troy, it seems, are divers too!"
13864,BOOK XVI.,"So saying, on bold Cebriones he sprang"
13865,BOOK XVI.,"With all a lion’s force, who, while the folds"
13866,BOOK XVI.,"He ravages, is wounded in the breast,"
13867,BOOK XVI.,"And, victim of his own fierce courage, dies.920"
13868,BOOK XVI.,"So didst thou spring, Patroclus! to despoil"
13869,BOOK XVI.,"Cebriones, and Hector opposite"
13870,BOOK XVI.,Leap’d also to the ground. Then contest such
13871,BOOK XVI.,For dead Cebriones those two between
13872,BOOK XVI.,"Arose, as in the lofty mountain-tops925"
13873,BOOK XVI.,"Two lions wage, contending for a deer"
13874,BOOK XVI.,"New-slain, both hunger-pinch’d and haughty both."
13875,BOOK XVI.,"So for Cebriones, alike in arms"
13876,BOOK XVI.,"Expert, brave Hector and Patroclus strove"
13877,BOOK XVI.,To pierce each other with the ruthless spear.930
13878,BOOK XVI.,"First, Hector seized his head, nor loosed his hold,"
13879,BOOK XVI.,"Patroclus, next, his feet, while all beside"
13880,BOOK XVI.,Of either host in furious battle join’d.
13881,BOOK XVI.,As when the East wind and the South contend
13882,BOOK XVI.,"To shake some deep wood on the mountain’s side,935"
13883,BOOK XVI.,"Or beech, or ash, or rugged cornel old."
13884,BOOK XVI.,With stormy violence the mingled boughs
13885,BOOK XVI.,"Smite and snap short each other, crashing loud;"
13886,BOOK XVI.,"So, Trojans and Achaians, mingling, slew"
13887,BOOK XVI.,"Mutual, while neither felt a wish to fly.940"
13888,BOOK XVI.,"Around Cebriones stood many a spear,"
13889,BOOK XVI.,And many a shaft sent smartly from the nerve
13890,BOOK XVI.,"Implanted deep, and many a stone of grasp"
13891,BOOK XVI.,Enormous sounded on their batter’d shields
13892,BOOK XVI.,"Who fought to gain him. He, in eddies lost945"
13893,BOOK XVI.,"Of sable dust, with his huge trunk huge space"
13894,BOOK XVI.,"O’erspread, nor steeds nor chariots heeded more."
13895,BOOK XVI.,"While yet the sun ascending climb’d the heavens,"
13896,BOOK XVI.,"Their darts flew equal, and the people fell;"
13897,BOOK XVI.,"But when he westward journey’d, by a change950"
13898,BOOK XVI.,Surpassing hope the Grecians then prevail’d.
13899,BOOK XVI.,They drew Cebriones the hero forth
13900,BOOK XVI.,"From all those weapons, and his armor stripp’d"
13901,BOOK XVI.,"At leisure, distant from the battle’s roar."
13902,BOOK XVI.,Then sprang Patroclus on the Trojan host;955
13903,BOOK XVI.,"Thrice, like another Mars, he sprang with shouts"
13904,BOOK XVI.,"Tremendous, and nine warriors thrice he slew."
13905,BOOK XVI.,"But when the fourth time, demon-like, he rush’d"
13906,BOOK XVI.,"Against them, then, oh then, too manifest"
13907,BOOK XVI.,The consummation of thy days approach’d960
13908,BOOK XVI.,"Patroclus! whom Apollo, terror-clad"
13909,BOOK XVI.,Met then in battle. He the coming God
13910,BOOK XVI.,"Through all that multitude knew not, such gloom"
13911,BOOK XVI.,Impenetrable him involved around.
13912,BOOK XVI.,"Behind him close he stood, and with his palms965"
13913,BOOK XVI.,Expanded on the spine and shoulders broad
13914,BOOK XVI.,Smote him; his eyes swam dizzy at the stroke.
13915,BOOK XVI.,Then Phœbus from his head his helmet dash’d
13916,BOOK XVI.,To earth; sonorous at the feet it roll’d
13917,BOOK XVI.,"Of many a prancing steed, and all the crest970"
13918,BOOK XVI.,"Defilement gather’d gross of dust and blood,"
13919,BOOK XVI.,"Then first; till then, impossible; for how"
13920,BOOK XVI.,Should dust the tresses of that helmet shame
13921,BOOK XVI.,With which Achilles fighting fenced his head
13922,BOOK XVI.,"Illustrious, and his graceful brows divine?975"
13923,BOOK XVI.,But Jove now made it Hector’s; he awhile
13924,BOOK XVI.,"Bore it, himself to swift perdition doom’d"
13925,BOOK XVI.,"His spear brass-mounted, ponderous, huge and long,"
13926,BOOK XVI.,Fell shiver’d from his grasp. His shield that swept
13927,BOOK XVI.,"His ancle, with its belt dropp’d from his arm,980"
13928,BOOK XVI.,And Phœbus loosed the corselet from his breast.
13929,BOOK XVI.,Confusion seized his brain; his noble limbs
13930,BOOK XVI.,"Quaked under him, and panic-stunn’d he stood."
13931,BOOK XVI.,"Then came a Dardan Chief, who from behind"
13932,BOOK XVI.,Enforced a pointed lance into his back985
13933,BOOK XVI.,"Between the shoulders; Panthus’ son was he,"
13934,BOOK XVI.,"Euphorbus, famous for equestrian skill,"
13935,BOOK XVI.,"For spearmanship, and in the rapid race"
13936,BOOK XVI.,Past all of equal age. He twenty men
13937,BOOK XVI.,"(Although a learner yet of martial feats,990"
13938,BOOK XVI.,And by his steeds then first to battle borne)
13939,BOOK XVI.,"Dismounted. He, Patroclus, mighty Chief!"
13940,BOOK XVI.,"First threw a lance at thee, which yet life"
13941,BOOK XVI.,Quell’d not; then snatching hasty from the wound
13942,BOOK XVI.,"His ashen beam, he ran into the crowd,995"
13943,BOOK XVI.,Nor dared confront in fight even the unarm’d
13944,BOOK XVI.,"Patroclus. But Patroclus, by the lance,"
13945,BOOK XVI.,And by the stroke of an immortal hand
13946,BOOK XVI.,"Subdued, fell back toward his ranks again."
13947,BOOK XVI.,"Then, soon as Hector the retreat perceived1000"
13948,BOOK XVI.,"Of brave Patroclus wounded, issuing forth"
13949,BOOK XVI.,"From his own phalanx, he approach’d and drove"
13950,BOOK XVI.,A spear right through his body at the waist.
13951,BOOK XVI.,Sounding he fell. Loud groan’d Achaia’s host.
13952,BOOK XVI.,As when the lion and the sturdy boar1005
13953,BOOK XVI.,Contend in battle on the mountain-tops
13954,BOOK XVI.,"For some scant rivulet, thirst-parch’d alike,"
13955,BOOK XVI.,Ere long the lion quells the panting boar;
13956,BOOK XVI.,"So Priameian Hector, spear in hand,"
13957,BOOK XVI.,Slew Menœtiades the valiant slayer1010
13958,BOOK XVI.,"Of multitudes, and thus in accents wing’d,"
13959,BOOK XVI.,With fierce delight exulted in his fall.
13960,BOOK XVI.,
13961,BOOK XVI.,"It was thy thought, Patroclus, to have laid"
13962,BOOK XVI.,"Our city waste, and to have wafted hence"
13963,BOOK XVI.,"Our wives and daughters to thy native land,1015"
13964,BOOK XVI.,Their day of liberty for ever set.
13965,BOOK XVI.,Fool! for their sakes the feet of Hector’s steeds
13966,BOOK XVI.,"Fly into battle, and myself excel,"
13967,BOOK XVI.,"For their sakes, all our bravest of the spear,"
13968,BOOK XVI.,That I may turn from them that evil hour1020
13969,BOOK XVI.,"Necessitous. But thou art vulture’s food,"
13970,BOOK XVI.,"Unhappy youth! all valiant as he is,"
13971,BOOK XVI.,"Achilles hath no succor given to thee,"
13972,BOOK XVI.,Who when he sent the forth whither himself
13973,BOOK XVI.,"Would not, thus doubtless gave thee oft in charge:1025"
13974,BOOK XVI.,"Ah, well beware, Patroclus, glorious Chief!"
13975,BOOK XVI.,"That thou revisit not these ships again,"
13976,BOOK XVI.,Till first on hero-slaughterer Hector’s breast
13977,BOOK XVI.,"Thou cleave his bloody corselet. So he spake,"
13978,BOOK XVI.,And with vain words thee credulous beguiled.1030
13979,BOOK XVI.,"To whom Patroclus, mighty Chief, with breath"
13980,BOOK XVI.,"Drawn faintly, and dying, thou didst thus reply."
13981,BOOK XVI.,"Now, Hector, boast! now glory! for the son"

13983,BOOK XVI.,"Vanquishing, whom they had themselves disarm’d,1035"
13984,BOOK XVI.,"Have made the victory thine; else, twenty such"

13986,BOOK XVI.,Me Phœbus and my ruthless fate combined

13989,BOOK XVI.,"I tell thee also, and within thy heart"
13990,BOOK XVI.,Repose it deep—thou shalt not long survive;

14001,BOOK XVI.,"May not the son of Thetis azure-hair’d,"

14006,BOOK XVI.,"But lance in hand, the godlike charioteer"

14100,BOOK XVII.,"By Menelaus, son of Atreus, slain"
14101,BOOK XVII.,"Suddenly, and of all his arms despoil’d."
14102,BOOK XVII.,"But as the lion on the mountains bred,"
14103,BOOK XVII.,"Glorious in strength, when he hath seized the best"
14104,BOOK XVII.,"And fairest of the herd, with savage fangs75"
14105,BOOK XVII.,"First breaks her neck, then laps the bloody paunch"
14106,BOOK XVII.,"Torn wide; meantime, around him, but remote,"
14107,BOOK XVII.,"Dogs stand and swains clamoring, yet by fear"
14108,BOOK XVII.,"Repress’d, annoy him not nor dare approach;"
14109,BOOK XVII.,So there all wanted courage to oppose80
14110,BOOK XVII.,"The force of Menelaus, glorious Chief."
14111,BOOK XVII.,"Then, easily had Menelaus borne"
14112,BOOK XVII.,"The armor of the son of Panthus thence,"
14113,BOOK XVII.,But that Apollo the illustrious prize
14114,BOOK XVII.,"Denied him, who in semblance of the Chief85"
14115,BOOK XVII.,"Of the Ciconians, Mentes, prompted forth"
14116,BOOK XVII.,"Against him Hector terrible as Mars,"
14117,BOOK XVII.,Whose spirit thus in accents wing’d he roused.
14118,BOOK XVII.,Hector! the chase is vain; here thou pursuest
14119,BOOK XVII.,"The horses of Æacides the brave,90"
14120,BOOK XVII.,"Which thou shalt never win, for they are steeds"
14121,BOOK XVII.,"Of fiery nature, such as ill endure"
14122,BOOK XVII.,"To draw or carry mortal man, himself"
14123,BOOK XVII.,"Except, whom an immortal mother bore."
14124,BOOK XVII.,"Meantime, bold Menelaus, in defence95"
14125,BOOK XVII.,"Of dead Patroclus, hath a Trojan slain"
14126,BOOK XVII.,"Of highest note, Euphorbus, Panthus’ son,"
14127,BOOK XVII.,And hath his might in arms for ever quell’d.
14128,BOOK XVII.,So spake the God and to the fight return’d.
14129,BOOK XVII.,But grief intolerable at that word100
14130,BOOK XVII.,"Seized Hector; darting through the ranks his eye,"
14131,BOOK XVII.,"He knew at once who stripp’d Euphorbus’ arms,"
14132,BOOK XVII.,"And him knew also lying on the field,"
14133,BOOK XVII.,And from his wide wound bleeding copious still.
14134,BOOK XVII.,"Then dazzling bright in arms, through all the van105"
14135,BOOK XVII.,"He flew, shrill-shouting, fierce as Vulcan’s fire"
14136,BOOK XVII.,Unquenchable; nor were his shouts unheard
14137,BOOK XVII.,"By Atreus’ son, who with his noble mind"
14138,BOOK XVII.,"Conferring sad, thus to himself began."
14139,BOOK XVII.,"Alas! if I forsake these gorgeous spoils,110"
14140,BOOK XVII.,"And leave Patroclus for my glory slain,"
14141,BOOK XVII.,I fear lest the Achaians at that sight
14142,BOOK XVII.,"Incensed, reproach me; and if, urged by shame,"
14143,BOOK XVII.,"I fight with Hector and his host, alone,"
14144,BOOK XVII.,"Lest, hemm’d around by multitudes, I fall;115"
14145,BOOK XVII.,"For Hector, by his whole embattled force"
14146,BOOK XVII.,"Attended, comes. But whither tend my thoughts?"
14147,BOOK XVII.,No man may combat with another fenced
14148,BOOK XVII.,"By power divine and whom the Gods exalt,"
14149,BOOK XVII.,But he must draw down wo on his own head.120
14150,BOOK XVII.,"Me, therefore, none of all Achaia’s host"
14151,BOOK XVII.,"Will blame indignant, seeing my retreat"
14152,BOOK XVII.,"From Hector, whom themselves the Gods assist."
14153,BOOK XVII.,But might the battle-shout of Ajax once
14154,BOOK XVII.,"Reach me, with force united we would strive,125"
14155,BOOK XVII.,"Even in opposition to a God,"
14156,BOOK XVII.,"To rescue for Achilles’ sake, his friend."
14157,BOOK XVII.,Task arduous! but less arduous than this.
14158,BOOK XVII.,"While he thus meditated, swift advanced"
14159,BOOK XVII.,"The Trojan ranks, with Hector at their head.130"
14160,BOOK XVII.,"He then, retiring slow, and turning oft,"
14161,BOOK XVII.,Forsook the body. As by dogs and swains
14162,BOOK XVII.,With clamors loud and spears driven from the stalls
14163,BOOK XVII.,"A bearded lion goes, his noble heart"
14164,BOOK XVII.,"Abhors retreat, and slow he quits the prey;135"
14165,BOOK XVII.,So Menelaus with slow steps forsook
14166,BOOK XVII.,"Patroclus, and arrived in front, at length,"
14167,BOOK XVII.,"Of his own phalanx, stood, with sharpen’d eyes"
14168,BOOK XVII.,"Seeking vast Ajax, son of Telamon."
14169,BOOK XVII.,"Him leftward, soon, of all the field he mark’d140"
14170,BOOK XVII.,"Encouraging aloud his band, whose hearts"
14171,BOOK XVII.,With terrors irresistible himself
14172,BOOK XVII.,"Phœbus had fill’d. He ran, and at his side"
14173,BOOK XVII.,"Standing, incontinent him thus bespake."
14174,BOOK XVII.,"My gallant Ajax, haste—come quickly—strive145"
14175,BOOK XVII.,With me to rescue for Achilles’ sake
14176,BOOK XVII.,"His friend, though bare, for Hector hath his arms."
14177,BOOK XVII.,"He said, and by his words the noble mind"
14178,BOOK XVII.,Of Ajax roused; issuing through the van
14179,BOOK XVII.,"He went, and Menelaus at his side.150"
14180,BOOK XVII.,"Hector the body of Patroclus dragg’d,"
14181,BOOK XVII.,"Stript of his arms, with falchion keen erelong"
14182,BOOK XVII.,"Purposing to strike off his head, and cast"
14183,BOOK XVII.,"His trunk, drawn distant, to the dogs of Troy."
14184,BOOK XVII.,"But Ajax, with broad shield tower-like, approach’d.155"
14185,BOOK XVII.,"Then Hector, to his bands retreating, sprang"
14186,BOOK XVII.,"Into his chariot, and to others gave"
14187,BOOK XVII.,"The splendid arms in charge, who into Troy"
14188,BOOK XVII.,"Should bear the destined trophy of his praise,"
14189,BOOK XVII.,But Ajax with his broad shield guarding stood160
14190,BOOK XVII.,"Slain Menœtiades, as for his whelps"
14191,BOOK XVII.,The lion stands; him through some forest drear
14192,BOOK XVII.,"Leading his little ones, the hunters meet;"
14193,BOOK XVII.,"Fire glimmers in his looks, and down he draws"
14194,BOOK XVII.,"His whole brow into frowns, covering his eyes;165"
14195,BOOK XVII.,"So, guarding slain Patroclus, Ajax lour’d."
14196,BOOK XVII.,"On the other side, with tender grief oppress’d"
14197,BOOK XVII.,"Unspeakable, brave Menelaus stood."
14198,BOOK XVII.,"But Glaucus, leader of the Lycian band,"
14199,BOOK XVII.,"Son of Hippolochus, in bitter terms170"
14200,BOOK XVII.,"Indignant, reprimanded Hector thus,"
14201,BOOK XVII.,"Ah, Hector, Chieftain of excelling form,"
14202,BOOK XVII.,But all unfurnish’d with a warrior’s heart!
14203,BOOK XVII.,Unwarranted I deem thy great renown
14204,BOOK XVII.,"Who art to flight addicted. Think, henceforth,175"
14205,BOOK XVII.,How ye shall save city and citadel
14206,BOOK XVII.,"Thou and thy people born in Troy, alone."
14207,BOOK XVII.,"No Lycian shall, at least, in your defence"
14208,BOOK XVII.,"Fight with the Grecians, for our ceaseless toil"
14209,BOOK XVII.,"In arms, hath ever been a thankless task.180"
14210,BOOK XVII.,Inglorious Chief! how wilt thou save a worse
14211,BOOK XVII.,"From warring crowds, who hast Sarpedon left"
14212,BOOK XVII.,"Thy guest, thy friend, to be a spoil, a prey"
14213,BOOK XVII.,To yonder Argives? While he lived he much
14214,BOOK XVII.,"Thee and thy city profited, whom dead185"
14215,BOOK XVII.,Thou fear’st to rescue even from the dogs.
14216,BOOK XVII.,"Now, therefore, may but my advice prevail,"
14217,BOOK XVII.,"Back to your country, Lycians! so, at once,"
14218,BOOK XVII.,Shall remediless ruin fall on Troy.
14219,BOOK XVII.,For had the Trojans now a daring heart190
14220,BOOK XVII.,"Intrepid, such as in the breast resides"
14221,BOOK XVII.,"Of laborers in their country’s dear behalf,"
14222,BOOK XVII.,We soon should drag Patroclus into Troy;
14223,BOOK XVII.,"And were his body, from the battle drawn,"
14224,BOOK XVII.,"In Priam’s royal city once secured,195"
14225,BOOK XVII.,"As soon, the Argives would in ransom give"
14226,BOOK XVII.,Sarpedon’s body with his splendid arms
14227,BOOK XVII.,To be conducted safe into the town.
14228,BOOK XVII.,"For when Patroclus fell, the friend was slain"
14229,BOOK XVII.,Of such a Chief as is not in the fleet200
14230,BOOK XVII.,"For valor, and his bands are dauntless all."
14231,BOOK XVII.,"But thou, at the first glimpse of Ajax’ eye"
14232,BOOK XVII.,"Confounded, hast not dared in arms to face"
14233,BOOK XVII.,"That warrior bold, superior far to thee."
14234,BOOK XVII.,"To whom brave Hector, frowning stern, replied,205"
14235,BOOK XVII.,"Why, Glaucus! should a Chief like thee his tongue"
14236,BOOK XVII.,Presume to employ thus haughtily? My friend!
14237,BOOK XVII.,"I thee accounted wisest, once, of all"
14238,BOOK XVII.,"Who dwell in fruitful Lycia, but thy speech"
14239,BOOK XVII.,"Now utter’d altogether merits blame,210"
14240,BOOK XVII.,In which thou tell’st me that I fear to stand
14241,BOOK XVII.,Against vast Ajax. Know that I from fight
14242,BOOK XVII.,"Shrink not, nor yet from sound of prancing steeds;"
14243,BOOK XVII.,But Jove’s high purpose evermore prevails
14244,BOOK XVII.,Against the thoughts of man; he turns to flight215
14245,BOOK XVII.,"The bravest, and the victory takes with ease"
14246,BOOK XVII.,Even from those whom once he favor’d most.
14247,BOOK XVII.,"But hither, friend! stand with me; mark my deed;"
14248,BOOK XVII.,"Prove me, if I be found, as thou hast said,"
14249,BOOK XVII.,"An idler all the day, or if by force220"
14250,BOOK XVII.,I not compel some Grecian to renounce
14251,BOOK XVII.,"Patroclus, even the boldest of them all."
14252,BOOK XVII.,"He ceased, and to his host exclaim’d aloud."
14253,BOOK XVII.,"Trojans, and Lycians, and close-fighting sons"
14254,BOOK XVII.,"Of Dardanus, oh be ye men, my friends!225"
14255,BOOK XVII.,"Now summon all your fortitude, while I"
14256,BOOK XVII.,"Put on the armor of Achilles, won"
14257,BOOK XVII.,From the renown’d Patroclus slain by me.
14258,BOOK XVII.,"So saying, illustrious Hector from the clash"
14259,BOOK XVII.,"Of spears withdrew, and with his swiftest pace230"
14260,BOOK XVII.,"Departing, overtook, not far remote,"
14261,BOOK XVII.,The bearers of Achilles’ arms to Troy.
14262,BOOK XVII.,Apart from all the horrors of the field
14263,BOOK XVII.,"Standing, he changed his armor; gave his own"
14264,BOOK XVII.,"To be by them to sacred Ilium borne,235"
14265,BOOK XVII.,And the immortal arms of Peleus’ son
14266,BOOK XVII.,"Achilles, by the ever-living Gods"
14267,BOOK XVII.,"To Peleüs given, put on. Those arms the Sire,"
14268,BOOK XVII.,"Now old himself, had on his son conferr’d"
14269,BOOK XVII.,But in those arms his son grew never old.240
14270,BOOK XVII.,"Him, therefore, soon as cloud-assembler Jove"
14271,BOOK XVII.,"Saw glittering in divine Achilles’ arms,"
14272,BOOK XVII.,"Contemplative he shook his brows, and said,"
14273,BOOK XVII.,"Ah hapless Chief! thy death, although at hand,"
14274,BOOK XVII.,Nought troubles thee. Thou wear’st his heavenly245
14275,BOOK XVII.,"Who all excels, terror of Ilium’s host."
14276,BOOK XVII.,"His friend, though bold yet gentle, thou hast slain"
14277,BOOK XVII.,And hast the brows and bosom of the dead
14278,BOOK XVII.,"Unseemly bared: yet, bright success awhile"
14279,BOOK XVII.,"I give thee; so compensating thy lot,250"
14280,BOOK XVII.,From whom Andromache shall ne’er receive
14281,BOOK XVII.,"Those glorious arms, for thou shalt ne’er return."
14282,BOOK XVII.,"So spake the Thunderer, and his sable brows"
14283,BOOK XVII.,"Shaking, confirm’d the word. But Hector found"
14284,BOOK XVII.,The armor apt; the God of war his soul255
14285,BOOK XVII.,"With fury fill’d, he felt his limbs afresh"
14286,BOOK XVII.,"Invigorated, and with loudest shouts"
14287,BOOK XVII.,Return’d to his illustrious allies.
14288,BOOK XVII.,"To them he seem’d, clad in those radiant arms,"
14289,BOOK XVII.,Himself Achilles; rank by rank he pass’d260
14290,BOOK XVII.,"Through all the host, exhorting every Chief,"
14291,BOOK XVII.,"Asteropæus, Mesthles, Phorcys, Medon,"
14292,BOOK XVII.,"Thersilochus, Deisenor, augur Ennomus,"
14293,BOOK XVII.,"Chromius, Hippothoüs; all these he roused"
14294,BOOK XVII.,"To battle, and in accents wing’d began.265"
14295,BOOK XVII.,"Hear me, ye myriads, neighbors and allies!"
14296,BOOK XVII.,For not through fond desire to fill the plain
14297,BOOK XVII.,"With multitudes, have I convened you here"
14298,BOOK XVII.,"Each from his city, but that well-inclined"
14299,BOOK XVII.,"To Ilium, ye might help to guard our wives270"
14300,BOOK XVII.,And little ones against the host of Greece.
14301,BOOK XVII.,Therefore it is that forage large and gifts
14302,BOOK XVII.,"Providing for you, I exhaust the stores"
14303,BOOK XVII.,"Of Troy, and drain our people for your sake."
14304,BOOK XVII.,"Turn then direct against them, and his life275"
14305,BOOK XVII.,"Save each, or lose; it is the course of war."
14306,BOOK XVII.,"Him who shall drag, though dead, Patroclus home"
14307,BOOK XVII.,"Into the host of Troy, and shall repulse"
14308,BOOK XVII.,"Ajax, I will reward with half the spoils"
14309,BOOK XVII.,And half shall be my own; glory and praise280
14310,BOOK XVII.,"Shall also be his meed, equal to mine."
14311,BOOK XVII.,He ended; they compact with lifted spears
14312,BOOK XVII.,"Bore on the Danaï, conceiving each"
14313,BOOK XVII.,Warm expectation in his heart to wrest
14314,BOOK XVII.,"From Ajax son of Telamon, the dead.285"
14315,BOOK XVII.,Vain hope! he many a lifeless Trojan heap’d
14316,BOOK XVII.,"On slain Patroclus, but at length his speech"
14317,BOOK XVII.,To warlike Menelaus thus address’d.
14318,BOOK XVII.,"Ah, Menelaus, valiant friend! I hope"
14319,BOOK XVII.,"No longer, now, that even we shall ’scape290"
14320,BOOK XVII.,Ourselves from fight; nor fear I so the loss
14321,BOOK XVII.,"Of dead Patroclus, who shall soon the dogs"
14322,BOOK XVII.,"Of Ilium, and the fowls sate with his flesh,"
14323,BOOK XVII.,"As for my life I tremble and for thine,"
14324,BOOK XVII.,"That cloud of battle, Hector, such a gloom295"
14325,BOOK XVII.,Sheds all around; death manifest impends.
14326,BOOK XVII.,"Haste—call our best, if even they can hear."
14327,BOOK XVII.,"He spake, nor Menelaus not complied,"
14328,BOOK XVII.,But call’d aloud on all the Chiefs of Greece.
14329,BOOK XVII.,"Friends, senators, and leaders of the powers300"
14330,BOOK XVII.,Of Argos! who with Agamemnon drink
14331,BOOK XVII.,"And Menelaus at the public feast,"
14332,BOOK XVII.,"Each bearing rule o’er many, by the will"
14333,BOOK XVII.,Of Jove advanced to honor and renown!
14334,BOOK XVII.,The task were difficult to single out305
14335,BOOK XVII.,Chief after Chief by name amid the blaze
14336,BOOK XVII.,"Of such contention; but oh, come yourselves"
14337,BOOK XVII.,"Indignant forth, nor let the dogs of Troy"
14338,BOOK XVII.,"Patroclus rend, and gambol with his bones!"
14339,BOOK XVII.,"He ceased, whom Oïliades the swift310"
14340,BOOK XVII.,"Hearing incontinent, of all the Chiefs"
14341,BOOK XVII.,"Ran foremost, after whom Idomeneus"
14342,BOOK XVII.,"Approach’d, and dread as homicidal Mars"
14343,BOOK XVII.,Meriones. But never mind of man
14344,BOOK XVII.,Could even in silent recollection name315
14345,BOOK XVII.,"The whole vast multitude who, following these"
14346,BOOK XVII.,Renew’d the battle on the part of Greece.
14347,BOOK XVII.,"The Trojans first, with Hector at their head,"
14348,BOOK XVII.,"Wedged in close phalanx, rush’d to the assault"
14349,BOOK XVII.,As when within some rapid river’s mouth320
14350,BOOK XVII.,"The billows and stream clash, on either shore[3]"
14351,BOOK XVII.,"Loud sounds the roar[3] of waves ejected wide,"
14352,BOOK XVII.,Such seem’d the clamors of the Trojan host.
14353,BOOK XVII.,"But the Achaians, one in heart, around"
14354,BOOK XVII.,"Patroclus stood, bulwark’d with shields of brass325"
14355,BOOK XVII.,And over all their glittering helmets Jove
14356,BOOK XVII.,"Darkness diffused, for he had loved Patroclus"
14357,BOOK XVII.,"While yet he lived friend of Æacides,"
14358,BOOK XVII.,"And now, abhorring that the dogs of Troy"
14359,BOOK XVII.,"Should eat him, urged the Greeks to his defence,330"
14360,BOOK XVII.,The host of Troy first shook the Grecian host;
14361,BOOK XVII.,"The body left, they fled; yet of them all,"
14362,BOOK XVII.,"The Trojan powers, determined as they were,"
14363,BOOK XVII.,"Slew none, but dragg’d the body. Neither stood"
14364,BOOK XVII.,"The Greeks long time aloof, soon as repulsed335"
14365,BOOK XVII.,"Again led on by Ajax, who in form"
14366,BOOK XVII.,And in exploits all others far excell’d.
14367,BOOK XVII.,Peerless Æacides alone except.
14368,BOOK XVII.,"Right through the foremost combatants he rush’d,"
14369,BOOK XVII.,In force resembling most some savage boar340
14370,BOOK XVII.,"That in the mountains bursting through the brakes,"
14371,BOOK XVII.,The swains disperses and their hounds with ease;
14372,BOOK XVII.,"Like him, illustrious Ajax, mighty son"
14373,BOOK XVII.,"Of Telamon, at his assault dispersed"
14374,BOOK XVII.,With ease the close imbattled ranks who fought345
14375,BOOK XVII.,"Around Patroclus’ body, strong in hope"
14376,BOOK XVII.,"To achieve it, and to make the glory theirs."
14377,BOOK XVII.,"Hippothoüs, a youth of high renown,"
14378,BOOK XVII.,"Son of Pelasgian Lethus, by a noose"
14379,BOOK XVII.,Around his ancle cast dragg’d through the fight350
14380,BOOK XVII.,"Patroclus, so to gratify the host"
14381,BOOK XVII.,Of Ilium and their Chief; but evil him
14382,BOOK XVII.,"Reached suddenly, by none of all his friends"
14383,BOOK XVII.,(Though numerous wish’d to save him) turn’d aside.
14384,BOOK XVII.,For swift advancing on him through the crowd355
14385,BOOK XVII.,"The son of Telamon pierced, spear in hand,"
14386,BOOK XVII.,"His helmet brazen-cheek’d; the crested casque,"
14387,BOOK XVII.,"So smitten, open’d wide, for huge the hand"
14388,BOOK XVII.,And ponderous was the spear that gave the blow
14389,BOOK XVII.,"And all around its neck, mingled with blood360"
14390,BOOK XVII.,"Gush’d forth the brain. There, lifeless, down he sank,"
14391,BOOK XVII.,"Let fall the hero’s foot, and fell himself"
14392,BOOK XVII.,"Prone on the dead, never to see again?"
14393,BOOK XVII.,"Deep-soil’d Larissa, never to require"
14394,BOOK XVII.,"Their kind solicitudes who gave him birth,365"
14395,BOOK XVII.,In bloom of life by dauntless Ajax slain.
14396,BOOK XVII.,"Then Hector hurl’d at Ajax his bright spear,"
14397,BOOK XVII.,"But he, forewarn’d of its approach, escaped"
14398,BOOK XVII.,"Narrowly, and it pierced Schedius instead,"
14399,BOOK XVII.,"Brave son of Iphitus; he, noblest Chief370"
14400,BOOK XVII.,"Of the Phocensians, over many reign’d,"
14401,BOOK XVII.,Dwelling in Panopeus the far-renown’d.
14402,BOOK XVII.,Entering beneath the clavicle[4] the point
14403,BOOK XVII.,"Right through his shoulder’s summit pass’d behind,"
14404,BOOK XVII.,And on his loud-resounding arms he fell.375
14405,BOOK XVII.,But Ajax at his waist wounded the son
14406,BOOK XVII.,"Of Phœnops, valiant Phorcys, while he stood"
14407,BOOK XVII.,Guarding Hippothöus; through his hollow mail
14408,BOOK XVII.,"Enforced the weapon drank his inmost life,"
14409,BOOK XVII.,"And in his palm, supine, he clench’d the dust.380"
14410,BOOK XVII.,"Then, Hector with the foremost Chiefs of Troy"
14411,BOOK XVII.,"Fell back; the Argives sent a shout to heaven,"
14412,BOOK XVII.,And dragging Phorcys and Hippothöus thence
14413,BOOK XVII.,Stripp’d both. In that bright moment Ilium’s host
14414,BOOK XVII.,Fear-quell’d before Achaia’s warlike sons385
14415,BOOK XVII.,"Had Troy re-enter’d, and the host of Greece"
14416,BOOK XVII.,By matchless might and fortitude their own
14417,BOOK XVII.,"Had snatch’d a victory from the grasp of fate,"
14418,BOOK XVII.,"But that, himself, the King of radiant shafts"
14419,BOOK XVII.,Æneas roused; Epytis’ son he seem’d390
14420,BOOK XVII.,"Periphas, ancient in the service grown"
14421,BOOK XVII.,Of old Anchises whom he dearly loved;
14422,BOOK XVII.,"His form assumed, Apollo thus began."
14423,BOOK XVII.,"How could ye save, Æneas, were the Gods"
14424,BOOK XVII.,"Your enemies, the towers of lofty Troy?395"
14425,BOOK XVII.,"As I have others seen, warriors who would,"
14426,BOOK XVII.,"Men fill’d with might and valor, firm themselves"
14427,BOOK XVII.,And Chiefs of multitudes disdaining fear.
14428,BOOK XVII.,But Jove to us the victory far more
14429,BOOK XVII.,Than to the Grecians wills; therefore the fault400
14430,BOOK XVII.,"Is yours, who tremble and refuse the fight."
14431,BOOK XVII.,"He ended, whom Æneas marking, knew"
14432,BOOK XVII.,"At once the glorious Archer of the skies,"
14433,BOOK XVII.,And thus to distant Hector call’d aloud.
14434,BOOK XVII.,"Oh, Hector, and ye other Chiefs of Troy405"
14435,BOOK XVII.,And of her brave confederates! Shame it were
14436,BOOK XVII.,"Should we re-enter Ilium, driven to flight"
14437,BOOK XVII.,By dastard fear before the host of Greece.
14438,BOOK XVII.,"A God assured me even now, that Jove,"
14439,BOOK XVII.,"Supreme in battle, gives his aid to Troy.410"
14440,BOOK XVII.,"Rush, therefore, on the Danaï direct,"
14441,BOOK XVII.,"Nor let them, safe at least and unannoy’d,"
14442,BOOK XVII.,Bear hence Patroclus’ body to the fleet.
14443,BOOK XVII.,"He spake, and starting far into the van"
14444,BOOK XVII.,"Stood foremost forth; they, wheeling, faced the Greeks.415"
14445,BOOK XVII.,"Then, spear in hand, Æneas smote the friend"
14446,BOOK XVII.,"Of Lycomedes, brave Leocritus,"
14447,BOOK XVII.,Son of Arisbas. Lycomedes saw
14448,BOOK XVII.,"Compassionate his death, and drawing nigh"
14449,BOOK XVII.,"First stood, then hurling his resplendent lance,420"
14450,BOOK XVII.,Right through the liver Apisaon pierced
14451,BOOK XVII.,"Offspring of Hippasus, his chest beneath,"
14452,BOOK XVII.,"And, lifeless, instant, on the field he fell."
14453,BOOK XVII.,He from Pæonia the deep soil’d to Troy
14454,BOOK XVII.,"Came forth, Asteropæus sole except,425"
14455,BOOK XVII.,Bravest of all Pæonia’s band in arms.
14456,BOOK XVII.,"Asteropæus saw, and to the van"
14457,BOOK XVII.,"Sprang forth for furious combat well prepared,"
14458,BOOK XVII.,"But room for fight found none, so thick a fence"
14459,BOOK XVII.,Of shields and ported spears fronted secure430
14460,BOOK XVII.,The phalanx guarding Menœtiades.
14461,BOOK XVII.,"For Ajax ranging all the ranks, aloud"
14462,BOOK XVII.,Admonish’d them that no man yielding ground
14463,BOOK XVII.,"Should leave Patroclus, or advance before"
14464,BOOK XVII.,"The rest, but all alike fight and stand fast.435"
14465,BOOK XVII.,Such order gave huge Ajax; purple gore
14466,BOOK XVII.,Drench’d all the ground; in slaughter’d heaps they fell
14467,BOOK XVII.,Trojans and Trojan aids of dauntless hearts
14468,BOOK XVII.,And Grecians; for not even they the fight
14469,BOOK XVII.,"Waged bloodless, though with far less cost of blood,440"
14470,BOOK XVII.,Each mindful to avert his fellow’s fate.
14471,BOOK XVII.,Thus burn’d the battle; neither hadst thou deem’d
14472,BOOK XVII.,"The sun himself in heaven unquench’d, or moon,"
14473,BOOK XVII.,Beneath a cope so dense of darkness strove
14474,BOOK XVII.,Unceasing all the most renown’d in arms445
14475,BOOK XVII.,"For Menœtiades. Meantime the war,"
14476,BOOK XVII.,"Wherever else, the bright-arm’d Grecians waged"
14477,BOOK XVII.,And Trojans under skies serene. The sun
14478,BOOK XVII.,"On them his radiance darted; not a cloud,"
14479,BOOK XVII.,"From mountain or from vale rising, allay’d450"
14480,BOOK XVII.,His fervor; there at distance due they fought
14481,BOOK XVII.,"And paused by turns, and shunn’d the cruel dart."
14482,BOOK XVII.,But in the middle field not war alone
14483,BOOK XVII.,"They suffer’d, but night also; ruthless raged"
14484,BOOK XVII.,"The iron storm, and all the mightiest bled.455"
14485,BOOK XVII.,"Two glorious Chiefs, the while, Antilochus"
14486,BOOK XVII.,"And Thrasymedes, had no tidings heard"
14487,BOOK XVII.,"Of brave Patroclus slain, but deem’d him still"
14488,BOOK XVII.,"Living, and troubling still the host of Troy;"
14489,BOOK XVII.,For watchful[5] only to prevent the flight460
14490,BOOK XVII.,"Or slaughter of their fellow-warriors, they"
14491,BOOK XVII.,"Maintain’d a distant station, so enjoin’d"
14492,BOOK XVII.,By Nestor when he sent them to the field.
14493,BOOK XVII.,But fiery conflict arduous employ’d
14494,BOOK XVII.,"The rest all day continual; knees and legs,465"
14495,BOOK XVII.,"Feet, hands, and eyes of those who fought to guard"
14496,BOOK XVII.,The valiant friend of swift Æacides
14497,BOOK XVII.,Sweat gather’d foul and dust. As when a man
14498,BOOK XVII.,A huge ox-hide drunken with slippery lard
14499,BOOK XVII.,"Gives to be stretch’d, his servants all around470"
14500,BOOK XVII.,"Disposed, just intervals between, the task"
14501,BOOK XVII.,"Ply strenuous, and while many straining hard"
14502,BOOK XVII.,"Extend it equal on all sides, it sweats"
14503,BOOK XVII.,"The moisture out, and drinks the unction in,[6]"
14504,BOOK XVII.,"So they, in narrow space struggling, the dead475"
14505,BOOK XVII.,"Dragg’d every way, warm hope conceiving, these"
14506,BOOK XVII.,"To drag him thence to Troy, those, to the ships."
14507,BOOK XVII.,"Wild tumult raged around him; neither Mars,"
14508,BOOK XVII.,"Gatherer of hosts to battle, nor herself"
14509,BOOK XVII.,"Pallas, however angry, had beheld480"
14510,BOOK XVII.,"That conflict with disdain, Jove to such length"
14511,BOOK XVII.,Protracted on that day the bloody toil
14512,BOOK XVII.,Of steeds and men for Menœtiades.
14513,BOOK XVII.,Nor knew divine Achilles or had aught
14514,BOOK XVII.,"Heard of Patroclus slain, for from the ships485"
14515,BOOK XVII.,"Remote they fought, beneath the walls of Troy."
14516,BOOK XVII.,"He, therefore, fear’d not for his death, but hope"
14517,BOOK XVII.,"Indulged much rather, that, the battle push’d"
14518,BOOK XVII.,"To Ilium’s gates, he should return alive."
14519,BOOK XVII.,"For that his friend, unaided by himself490"
14520,BOOK XVII.,"Or ever aided, should prevail to lay"
14521,BOOK XVII.,"Troy waste, he nought supposed; by Thetis warn’d"
14522,BOOK XVII.,"In secret conference oft, he better knew"
14523,BOOK XVII.,Jove’s purpose; yet not even she had borne
14524,BOOK XVII.,"Those dreadful tidings to his ear, the loss495"
14525,BOOK XVII.,Immeasurable of his dearest friend.
14526,BOOK XVII.,They all around the dead fought spear in hand
14527,BOOK XVII.,"With mutual slaughter ceaseless, and amid"
14528,BOOK XVII.,Achaia’s host thus spake a Chief mail-arm’d.
14529,BOOK XVII.,"Shame were it, Grecians! should we seek by flight500"
14530,BOOK XVII.,Our galleys now; yawn earth our feet beneath
14531,BOOK XVII.,And here ingulf us rather! Better far
14532,BOOK XVII.,Than to permit the steed-famed host of Troy
14533,BOOK XVII.,"To drag Patroclus hence into the town,"
14534,BOOK XVII.,And make the glory of this conflict theirs.505
14535,BOOK XVII.,Thus also of the dauntless Trojans spake
14536,BOOK XVII.,"A certain warrior. Oh, my friends! although"
14537,BOOK XVII.,"The Fates ordain us, one and all, to die"
14538,BOOK XVII.,"Around this body, stand! quit not the field."
14539,BOOK XVII.,So spake the warrior prompting into act510
14540,BOOK XVII.,"The courage of his friends, and such they strove"
14541,BOOK XVII.,On both sides; high into the vault of heaven
14542,BOOK XVII.,The iron din pass’d through the desart air.
14543,BOOK XVII.,Meantime the horses of Æacides
14544,BOOK XVII.,"From fight withdrawn, soon as they understood515"
14545,BOOK XVII.,Their charioteer fallen in the dust beneath
14546,BOOK XVII.,"The arm of homicidal Hector, wept."
14547,BOOK XVII.,Them oft with hasty lash Diores’ son
14548,BOOK XVII.,"Automedon impatient smote, full oft"
14549,BOOK XVII.,"He stroked them gently, and as oft he chode;[7]520"
14550,BOOK XVII.,Yet neither to the fleet ranged on the shore
14551,BOOK XVII.,"Of spacious Hellespont would they return,"
14552,BOOK XVII.,"Nor with the Grecians seek the fight, but stood"
14553,BOOK XVII.,"As a sepulchral pillar stands, unmoved"
14554,BOOK XVII.,Between their traces;[8] to the earth they hung525
14555,BOOK XVII.,"Their heads, with plenteous tears their driver mourn’d,"
14556,BOOK XVII.,And mingled their dishevell’d manes with dust.
14557,BOOK XVII.,"Jove saw their grief with pity, and his brows"
14558,BOOK XVII.,"Shaking, within himself thus, pensive, said."
14559,BOOK XVII.,Ah hapless pair! Wherefore by gift divine530
14560,BOOK XVII.,"Were ye to Peleus given, a mortal king,"
14561,BOOK XVII.,Yourselves immortal and from age exempt?
14562,BOOK XVII.,Was it that ye might share in human woes?
14563,BOOK XVII.,"For, of all things that breathe or creep the earth,"
14564,BOOK XVII.,No creature lives so mere a wretch as man.535
14565,BOOK XVII.,Yet shall not Priameian Hector ride
14566,BOOK XVII.,"Triumphant, drawn by you. Myself forbid."
14567,BOOK XVII.,Suffice it that he boasts vain-gloriously
14568,BOOK XVII.,Those arms his own. Your spirit and your limbs
14569,BOOK XVII.,"I will invigorate, that ye may bear540"
14570,BOOK XVII.,Safe hence Automedon into the fleet.
14571,BOOK XVII.,For I ordain the Trojans still to spread
14572,BOOK XVII.,"Carnage around victorious, till they reach"
14573,BOOK XVII.,"The gallant barks, and till the sun at length"
14574,BOOK XVII.,"Descending, sacred darkness cover all.545"
14575,BOOK XVII.,"He said, and with new might the steeds inspired."
14576,BOOK XVII.,"They, shaking from their hair profuse the dust,"
14577,BOOK XVII.,Between the van of either army whirl’d
14578,BOOK XVII.,"The rapid chariot. Fighting as he pass’d,"
14579,BOOK XVII.,"Though fill’d with sorrow for his slaughter’d friend,550"
14580,BOOK XVII.,Automedon high-mounted swept the field
14581,BOOK XVII.,Impetuous as a vulture scattering geese;
14582,BOOK XVII.,"Now would he vanish, and now, turn’d again,"
14583,BOOK XVII.,Chase through a multitude his trembling foe;
14584,BOOK XVII.,"But whomsoe’er he follow’d, none he slew,555"
14585,BOOK XVII.,Nor was the task possible to a Chief
14586,BOOK XVII.,"Sole in the sacred chariot, both to aim"
14587,BOOK XVII.,The spear aright and guide the fiery steeds.
14588,BOOK XVII.,"At length Alcimedon, his friend in arms,"
14589,BOOK XVII.,"Son of Laerceus son of Æmon, him560"
14590,BOOK XVII.,"Observing, from behind the chariot hail’d"
14591,BOOK XVII.,"The flying warrior, whom he thus bespake."
14592,BOOK XVII.,"What power, Automedon! hath ta’en away"
14593,BOOK XVII.,"Thy better judgment, and thy breast inspired"
14594,BOOK XVII.,With this vain purpose to assail alone565
14595,BOOK XVII.,The Trojan van? Thy partner in the fight
14596,BOOK XVII.,"Is slain, and Hector on his shoulders bears,"
14597,BOOK XVII.,"Elate, the armor of Æacides."
14598,BOOK XVII.,"Then, answer thus Automedon return’d,"
14599,BOOK XVII.,Son of Diores. Who of all our host570
14600,BOOK XVII.,"Was ever skill’d, Alcimedon! as thou"
14601,BOOK XVII.,"To rule the fire of these immortal steeds,"
14602,BOOK XVII.,"Save only while he lived, peer of the Gods"
14603,BOOK XVII.,"In that great art, Patroclus, now no more?"
14604,BOOK XVII.,"Thou, therefore, the resplendent reins receive575"
14605,BOOK XVII.,"And scourge, while I, dismounting, wage the fight."
14606,BOOK XVII.,He ceased; Alcimedon without delay
14607,BOOK XVII.,"The battle-chariot mounting, seized at once"
14608,BOOK XVII.,"The lash and reins, and from his seat down leap’d"
14609,BOOK XVII.,"Automedon. Them noble Hector mark’d,580"
14610,BOOK XVII.,And to Æneas at his side began.
14611,BOOK XVII.,Illustrious Chief of Trojans brazen-mail’d
14612,BOOK XVII.,Æneas! I have noticed yonder steeds
14613,BOOK XVII.,Of swift Achilles rushing into fight
14614,BOOK XVII.,"Conspicuous, but under sway of hands585"
14615,BOOK XVII.,Unskilful; whence arises a fair hope
14616,BOOK XVII.,"That we might seize them, wert thou so inclined;"
14617,BOOK XVII.,For never would those two dare to oppose
14618,BOOK XVII.,In battle an assault dreadful as ours.
14619,BOOK XVII.,"He ended, nor the valiant son refused590"
14620,BOOK XVII.,"Of old Anchises, but with targets firm"
14621,BOOK XVII.,Of season’d hide brass-plated thrown athwart
14622,BOOK XVII.,"Their shoulders, both advanced direct, with whom"
14623,BOOK XVII.,Of godlike form Aretus also went
14624,BOOK XVII.,And Chromius. Ardent hope they all conceived595
14625,BOOK XVII.,"To slay those Chiefs, and from the field to drive"
14626,BOOK XVII.,Achilles’ lofty steeds. Vain hope! for them
14627,BOOK XVII.,No bloodless strife awaited with the force
14628,BOOK XVII.,"Of brave Automedon; he, prayer to Jove"
14629,BOOK XVII.,"First offering, felt his angry soul with might600"
14630,BOOK XVII.,"Heroic fill’d, and thus his faithful friend"
14631,BOOK XVII.,"Alcimedon, incontinent, address’d."
14632,BOOK XVII.,Alcimedon! hold not the steeds remote
14633,BOOK XVII.,But breathing on my back; for I expect
14634,BOOK XVII.,That never Priameïan Hector’s rage605
14635,BOOK XVII.,"Shall limit know, or pause, till, slaying us,"
14636,BOOK XVII.,He shall himself the coursers ample-maned
14637,BOOK XVII.,"Mount of Achilles, and to flight compel"
14638,BOOK XVII.,"The Argive host, or perish in the van."
14639,BOOK XVII.,"So saying, he call’d aloud on Menelaus610"
14640,BOOK XVII.,"With either Ajax. Oh, illustrious Chiefs"
14641,BOOK XVII.,"Of Argos, Menelaus, and ye bold"
14642,BOOK XVII.,Ajaces![9] leaving all your best to cope
14643,BOOK XVII.,"With Ilium’s powers and to protect the dead,"
14644,BOOK XVII.,From friends still living ward the bitter day.615
14645,BOOK XVII.,"For hither borne, two Chiefs, bravest of all"
14646,BOOK XVII.,"The Trojans, Hector and Æneas rush"
14647,BOOK XVII.,Right through the battle. The events of war
14648,BOOK XVII.,Heaven orders; therefore even I will give
14649,BOOK XVII.,"My spear its flight, and Jove dispose the rest!620"
14650,BOOK XVII.,"He said, and brandishing his massy spear"
14651,BOOK XVII.,Dismiss’d it at Aretus; full he smote
14652,BOOK XVII.,"His ample shield, nor stay’d the pointed brass,"
14653,BOOK XVII.,"But penetrating sheer the disk, his belt"
14654,BOOK XVII.,"Pierced also, and stood planted in his waist.625"
14655,BOOK XVII.,As when some vigorous youth with sharpen’d axe
14656,BOOK XVII.,A pastured bullock smites behind the horns
14657,BOOK XVII.,"And hews the muscle through; he, at the stroke"
14658,BOOK XVII.,"Springs forth and falls, so sprang Aretus forth,"
14659,BOOK XVII.,"Then fell supine, and in his bowels stood630"
14660,BOOK XVII.,The keen-edged lance still quivering till he died.
14661,BOOK XVII.,"Then Hector, in return, his radiant spear"
14662,BOOK XVII.,"Hurl’d at Automedon, who of its flight"
14663,BOOK XVII.,"Forewarn’d his body bowing prone, the stroke"
14664,BOOK XVII.,"Eluded, and the spear piercing the soil635"
14665,BOOK XVII.,"Behind him, shook to its superior end,"
14666,BOOK XVII.,"Till, spent by slow degrees, its fury slept."
14667,BOOK XVII.,"And now, with hand to hilt, for closer war"
14668,BOOK XVII.,"Both stood prepared, when through the multitude"
14669,BOOK XVII.,"Advancing at their fellow-warrior’s call,640"
14670,BOOK XVII.,The Ajaces suddenly their combat fierce
14671,BOOK XVII.,Prevented. Awed at once by their approach
14672,BOOK XVII.,"Hector retired, with whom Æneas went"
14673,BOOK XVII.,"Also and godlike Chromius, leaving there"
14674,BOOK XVII.,"Aretus with his vitals torn, whose arms,645"
14675,BOOK XVII.,Fierce as the God of war Automedon
14676,BOOK XVII.,"Stripp’d off, and thus exulted o’er the slain."
14677,BOOK XVII.,My soul some portion of her grief resigns
14678,BOOK XVII.,"Consoled, although by slaughter of a worse,"
14679,BOOK XVII.,For loss of valiant Menœtiades.650
14680,BOOK XVII.,"So saying, within his chariot he disposed"
14681,BOOK XVII.,"The gory spoils, then mounted it himself"
14682,BOOK XVII.,"With hands and feet purpled, as from a bull"
14683,BOOK XVII.,"His bloody prey, some lion newly-gorged."
14684,BOOK XVII.,And now around Patroclus raged again655
14685,BOOK XVII.,Dread strife deplorable! for from the skies
14686,BOOK XVII.,Descending at the Thunderer’s command
14687,BOOK XVII.,"Whose purpose now was to assist the Greeks,"
14688,BOOK XVII.,Pallas enhanced the fury of the fight.
14689,BOOK XVII.,"As when from heaven, in view of mortals, Jove660"
14690,BOOK XVII.,"Exhibits bright his bow, a sign ordain’d"
14691,BOOK XVII.,"Of war, or numbing frost which all the works"
14692,BOOK XVII.,Suspends of man and saddens all the flocks;
14693,BOOK XVII.,"So she, all mantled with a radiant cloud"
14694,BOOK XVII.,"Entering Achaia’s host, fired every breast.665"
14695,BOOK XVII.,"But meeting Menelaus first, brave son"
14696,BOOK XVII.,"Of Atreus, in the form and with the voice"
14697,BOOK XVII.,"Robust of Phœnix, him she thus bespake."
14698,BOOK XVII.,"Shame, Menelaus, shall to thee redound"
14699,BOOK XVII.,"For ever, and reproach, should dogs devour670"
14700,BOOK XVII.,The faithful friend of Peleus’ noble son
14701,BOOK XVII.,"Under Troy’s battlements; but stand, thyself,"
14702,BOOK XVII.,"Undaunted, and encourage all the host."
14703,BOOK XVII.,To whom the son of Atreus bold in arms.
14704,BOOK XVII.,"Ah, Phœnix, friend revered, ancient and sage!675"
14705,BOOK XVII.,Would Pallas give me might and from the dint
14706,BOOK XVII.,"Shield me of dart and spear, with willing mind"
14707,BOOK XVII.,"I would defend Patroclus, for his death"
14708,BOOK XVII.,Hath touch’d me deep. But Hector with the rage
14709,BOOK XVII.,"Burns of consuming fire, nor to his spear680"
14710,BOOK XVII.,"Gives pause, for him Jove leads to victory."
14711,BOOK XVII.,"He ceased, whom Pallas, Goddess azure-eyed"
14712,BOOK XVII.,"Hearing, rejoiced that of the heavenly powers"
14713,BOOK XVII.,He had invoked _her_ foremost to his aid.
14714,BOOK XVII.,"His shoulders with new might, and limbs she fill’d,685"
14715,BOOK XVII.,And persevering boldness to his breast
14716,BOOK XVII.,"Imparted, such as prompts the fly, which oft"
14717,BOOK XVII.,"From flesh of man repulsed, her purpose yet"
14718,BOOK XVII.,"To bite holds fast, resolved on human blood."
14719,BOOK XVII.,His stormy bosom with such courage fill’d690
14720,BOOK XVII.,"By Pallas, to Patroclus he approach’d"
14721,BOOK XVII.,"And hurl’d, incontinent, his glittering spear."
14722,BOOK XVII.,"There was a Trojan Chief, Podes by name,"
14723,BOOK XVII.,"Son of Eëtion, valorous and rich;"
14724,BOOK XVII.,Of all Troy’s citizens him Hector most695
14725,BOOK XVII.,"Respected, in convivial pleasures sweet"
14726,BOOK XVII.,"His chosen companion. As he sprang to flight,"
14727,BOOK XVII.,The hero of the golden locks his belt
14728,BOOK XVII.,Struck with full force and sent the weapon through.
14729,BOOK XVII.,"Sounding he fell, and from the Trojan ranks700"
14730,BOOK XVII.,Atrides dragg’d the body to his own.
14731,BOOK XVII.,"Then drew Apollo near to Hector’s side,"
14732,BOOK XVII.,"And in the form of Phœnops, Asius’ son,"
14733,BOOK XVII.,Of all the foreign guests at Hector’s board
14734,BOOK XVII.,"His favorite most, the hero thus address’d.705"
14735,BOOK XVII.,What Chief of all the Grecians shall henceforth
14736,BOOK XVII.,"Fear Hector, who from Menelaus shrinks"
14737,BOOK XVII.,"Once deem’d effeminate, but dragging now"
14738,BOOK XVII.,The body of thy valiant friend approved
14739,BOOK XVII.,"Whom he hath slain, Podes, Eëtion’s son?710"
14740,BOOK XVII.,"He spake, and at his words grief like a cloud"
14741,BOOK XVII.,Involved the mind of Hector dark around;
14742,BOOK XVII.,Right through the foremost combatants he rush’d
14743,BOOK XVII.,"All clad in dazzling brass. Then, lifting high"
14744,BOOK XVII.,"His tassel’d Ægis radiant, Jove with storms715"
14745,BOOK XVII.,"Enveloped Ida; flash’d his lightnings, roar’d"
14746,BOOK XVII.,"His thunders, and the mountain shook throughout."
14747,BOOK XVII.,"Troy’s host he prosper’d, and the Greeks dispersed."
14748,BOOK XVII.,"First fled Peneleus, the Bœotian Chief,"
14749,BOOK XVII.,Whom facing firm the foe Polydamas720
14750,BOOK XVII.,Struck on his shoulder’s summit with a lance
14751,BOOK XVII.,"Hurl’d nigh at hand, which slight inscribed the bone."
14752,BOOK XVII.,"[10]Leïtus also, son of the renown’d"
14753,BOOK XVII.,"Alectryon, pierced by Hector in the wrist,"
14754,BOOK XVII.,Disabled left the fight; trembling he fled725

14756,BOOK XVII.,To lift a spear against the Trojans more.
14757,BOOK XVII.,"Hector, pursuing Leïtus, the point"
14758,BOOK XVII.,Encounter’d of the brave Idomeneus
14759,BOOK XVII.,Full on his chest; but in his mail the lance730
14760,BOOK XVII.,"Snapp’d, and the Trojans shouted to the skies."
14761,BOOK XVII.,"He, in his turn, cast at Deucalion’s son"
14762,BOOK XVII.,"Idomeneus, who in that moment gain’d[11]"

14765,BOOK XVII.,The friend and follower of Meriones
14766,BOOK XVII.,"From wealthy Lyctus, and his charioteer."
14767,BOOK XVII.,"For when he left, that day, the gallant barks"
14768,BOOK XVII.,"Idomeneus had sought the field on foot,"
14769,BOOK XVII.,"And triumph proud, full sure, to Ilium’s host740"
14770,BOOK XVII.,"Had yielded now, but that with rapid haste"
14771,BOOK XVII.,"Cœranus drove to his relief, from him"
14772,BOOK XVII.,The fate averting which himself incurr’d
14773,BOOK XVII.,Victim of Hector’s homicidal arm.
14774,BOOK XVII.,Him Hector smiting between ear and jaw745
14775,BOOK XVII.,Push’d from their sockets with the lance’s point
14776,BOOK XVII.,"His firm-set teeth, and sever’d sheer his tongue."
14777,BOOK XVII.,"Dismounted down he fell, and from his hand"
14778,BOOK XVII.,"Let slide the flowing reins, which, to the earth"

14803,BOOK XVII.,Oh for some Grecian now to carry swift
14804,BOOK XVII.,"The tidings to Achilles’ ear, untaught,775"
14805,BOOK XVII.,"As I conjecture, yet the doleful news"
14806,BOOK XVII.,Of his Patroclus slain! but no such Greek
14807,BOOK XVII.,"May I discern, such universal gloom"
14808,BOOK XVII.,Both men and steeds envelops all around.
14809,BOOK XVII.,Father of heaven and earth! deliver thou780
14810,BOOK XVII.,Achaia’s host from darkness; clear the skies;
14811,BOOK XVII.,Give day; and (since thy sovereign will is such)
14812,BOOK XVII.,Destruction with it—but oh give us day![13]
14813,BOOK XVII.,"He spake, whose tears Jove saw with pity moved,"
14814,BOOK XVII.,And chased the untimely shades; bright beam’d the sun785
14815,BOOK XVII.,And the whole battle was display’d. Then spake
14816,BOOK XVII.,The hero thus to Atreus’ mighty son.
14817,BOOK XVII.,"Now noble Menelaus! looking forth,"
14818,BOOK XVII.,"See if Antilochus be yet alive,"
14819,BOOK XVII.,"Brave son of Nestor, whom exhort to fly790"
14820,BOOK XVII.,"With tidings to Achilles, of the friend"
14821,BOOK XVII.,"Whom most he loved, of his Patroclus slain."
14822,BOOK XVII.,"He ceased, nor Menelaus, dauntless Chief,"
14823,BOOK XVII.,"That task refused, but went; yet neither swift"
14824,BOOK XVII.,Nor willing. As a lion leaves the stalls795
14825,BOOK XVII.,"Wearied himself with harassing the guard,"
14826,BOOK XVII.,"Who, interdicting him his purposed prey,"
14827,BOOK XVII.,"Watch all the night; he famish’d, yet again"
14828,BOOK XVII.,"Comes furious on, but speeds not, kept aloof"

14830,BOOK XVII.,"By flash of torches which, though fierce, he dreads,"
14831,BOOK XVII.,"Till at the dawn, sullen he stalks away;"
14832,BOOK XVII.,So from Patroclus Menelaus went
14833,BOOK XVII.,Heroic Chief! reluctant; for he fear’d
14834,BOOK XVII.,"Lest the Achaians should resign the dead,805"
14835,BOOK XVII.,"Through consternation, to the host of Troy."
14836,BOOK XVII.,"Departing, therefore, he admonish’d oft"
14837,BOOK XVII.,"Meriones and the Ajaces, thus."
14838,BOOK XVII.,"Ye two brave leaders of the Argive host,"
14839,BOOK XVII.,"And thou, Meriones! now recollect810"
14840,BOOK XVII.,The gentle manners of Patroclus fallen
14841,BOOK XVII.,"Hapless in battle, who by carriage mild"
14842,BOOK XVII.,"Well understood, while yet he lived, to engage"
14843,BOOK XVII.,"All hearts, through prisoner now of death and fate."
14844,BOOK XVII.,"So saying, the hero amber-hair’d his steps815"
14845,BOOK XVII.,"Turn’d thence, the field exploring with an eye"
14846,BOOK XVII.,"Sharp as the eagle’s, of all fowls beneath"
14847,BOOK XVII.,"The azure heavens for keenest sight renown’d,"
14848,BOOK XVII.,"Whom, though he soar sublime, the leveret"
14849,BOOK XVII.,"By broadest leaves conceal’d ’scapes not, but swift820"
14850,BOOK XVII.,"Descending, even her he makes his prey;"
14851,BOOK XVII.,"So, noble Menelaus! were thine eyes"
14852,BOOK XVII.,Turn’d into every quarter of the host
14853,BOOK XVII.,"In search of Nestor’s son, if still he lived."
14854,BOOK XVII.,"Him, soon, encouraging his band to fight,825"
14855,BOOK XVII.,"He noticed on the left of all the field,"
14856,BOOK XVII.,"And sudden standing at his side, began."
14857,BOOK XVII.,"Antilochus! oh hear me, noble friend!"
14858,BOOK XVII.,And thou shalt learn tidings of such a deed
14859,BOOK XVII.,"As best had never been. Thou know’st, I judge,830"

14861,BOOK XVII.,"To victory the Trojan host, and rolls"
14862,BOOK XVII.,"Distress on ours; but ah! Patroclus lies,"
14863,BOOK XVII.,"Our chief Achaian, slain, whose loss the Greeks"

14865,BOOK XVII.,"Inform Achilles; bid him haste to save,"
14866,BOOK XVII.,"If save he can, the body of his friend;"
14867,BOOK XVII.,"He can no more, for Hector hath his arms."
14868,BOOK XVII.,He ceased. Antilochus with horror heard
14869,BOOK XVII.,"Those tidings; mute long time he stood, his eyes840"
14870,BOOK XVII.,"Swam tearful, and his voice, sonorous erst,"
14871,BOOK XVII.,"Found utterance none. Yet even so distress’d,"
14872,BOOK XVII.,He not the more neglected the command
14873,BOOK XVII.,"Of Menelaus. Setting forth to run,"
14874,BOOK XVII.,He gave his armor to his noble friend845
14875,BOOK XVII.,"Laodocus, who thither turn’d his steeds,"
14876,BOOK XVII.,"And weeping as he went, on rapid feet"
14877,BOOK XVII.,Sped to Achilles with that tale of wo.
14878,BOOK XVII.,Nor could the noble Menelaus stay
14879,BOOK XVII.,"To give the weary Pylian band, bereft850"
14880,BOOK XVII.,"Of their beloved Antilochus, his aid,"
14881,BOOK XVII.,"But leaving them to Thrasymedes’ care,"
14882,BOOK XVII.,"He flew to Menœtiades again,"
14883,BOOK XVII.,"And the Ajaces, thus, instant bespake."
14884,BOOK XVII.,He goes. I have dispatch’d him to the fleet855
14885,BOOK XVII.,To seek Achilles; but his coming naught
14886,BOOK XVII.,"Expect I now, although with rage he burn"
14887,BOOK XVII.,Against illustrious Hector; for what fight
14888,BOOK XVII.,"Can he, unarm’d, against the Trojans wage?"
14889,BOOK XVII.,"Deliberating, therefore, frame we means860"
14890,BOOK XVII.,"How best to save Patroclus, and to ’scape"
14891,BOOK XVII.,Ourselves unslain from this disastrous field.
14892,BOOK XVII.,Whom answer’d the vast son of Telamon.
14893,BOOK XVII.,Most noble Menelaus! good is all
14894,BOOK XVII.,Which thou hast spoken. Lift ye from the earth865
14895,BOOK XVII.,"Thou and Meriones, at once, and bear"
14896,BOOK XVII.,The dead Patroclus from the bloody field.
14897,BOOK XVII.,To cope meantime with Hector and his host
14898,BOOK XVII.,"Shall be our task, who, one in name, nor less"
14899,BOOK XVII.,"In spirit one, already have the brunt870"
14900,BOOK XVII.,"Of much sharp conflict, side by side, sustain’d."
14901,BOOK XVII.,He ended; they enfolding in their arms
14902,BOOK XVII.,"The dead, upbore him high above the ground"
14903,BOOK XVII.,With force united; after whom the host
14904,BOOK XVII.,"Of Troy, seeing the body borne away,875"
14905,BOOK XVII.,"Shouted, and with impetuous onset all"
14906,BOOK XVII.,"Follow’d them. As the hounds, urged from behind"
14907,BOOK XVII.,"By youthful hunters, on the wounded boar"
14908,BOOK XVII.,Make fierce assault; awhile at utmost speed
14909,BOOK XVII.,"They stretch toward him hungering, for the prey,880"
14910,BOOK XVII.,"But oft as, turning sudden, the stout brawn"
14911,BOOK XVII.,"Faces them, scatter’d on all sides escape;"
14912,BOOK XVII.,"The Trojans so, thick thronging in the rear,"
14913,BOOK XVII.,Ceaseless with falchions and spears double-edged
14914,BOOK XVII.,"Annoy’d them sore, but oft as in retreat885"
14915,BOOK XVII.,"The dauntless heroes, the Ajaces turn’d"
14916,BOOK XVII.,"To face them, deadly wan grew every cheek,"
14917,BOOK XVII.,And not a Trojan dared with onset rude
14918,BOOK XVII.,Molest them more in conflict for the dead.
14919,BOOK XVII.,"Thus they, laborious, forth from battle bore890"
14920,BOOK XVII.,"Patroclus to the fleet, tempestuous war"
14921,BOOK XVII.,"Their steps attending, rapid as the flames"

14927,BOOK XVII.,"And as two mules with strength for toil endued,"
14928,BOOK XVII.,Draw through rough ways down from the distant hills
14929,BOOK XVII.,"Huge timber, beam or mast; sweating they go,900"
14930,BOOK XVII.,And overlabor’d to faint weariness;
14931,BOOK XVII.,"So they the body bore, while, turning oft,"
14932,BOOK XVII.,The Ajaces check’d the Trojans. As a mound
14933,BOOK XVII.,Planted with trees and stretch’d athwart the mead
14934,BOOK XVII.,Repels an overflow; the torrents loud905

14945,BOOK XVII.,"So they shrill-clamoring toward the fleet,"

15155,BOOK XVIII.,Of Hellespont. Nor yet Achaia’s sons
15156,BOOK XVIII.,Had borne the body of Patroclus clear
15157,BOOK XVIII.,"From flight of darts away, but still again"
15158,BOOK XVIII.,The multitude of warriors and of steeds190
15159,BOOK XVIII.,"Came on, by Priameian Hector led"
15160,BOOK XVIII.,Rapid as fire. Thrice noble Hector seized
15161,BOOK XVIII.,"His ancles from behind, ardent to drag"
15162,BOOK XVIII.,"Patroclus, calling to his host the while;"
15163,BOOK XVIII.,"But thrice, the two Ajaces, clothed with might,195"
15164,BOOK XVIII.,Shock’d and repulsed him reeling. He with force
15165,BOOK XVIII.,"Fill’d indefatigable, through his ranks"
15166,BOOK XVIII.,"Issuing, by turns assail’d them, and by turns"
15167,BOOK XVIII.,"Stood clamoring, yet not a step retired;"
15168,BOOK XVIII.,But as the hinds deter not from his prey200
15169,BOOK XVIII.,"A tawny lion by keen hunger urged,"
15170,BOOK XVIII.,"So would not both Ajaces, warriors bold,"
15171,BOOK XVIII.,Intimidate and from the body drive
15172,BOOK XVIII.,Hector; and he had dragg’d him thence and won
15173,BOOK XVIII.,"Immortal glory, but that Iris, sent205"
15174,BOOK XVIII.,"Unseen by Jove and by the powers of heaven,"
15175,BOOK XVIII.,"From Juno, to Achilles brought command"
15176,BOOK XVIII.,"That he should show himself. Full near she drew,"
15177,BOOK XVIII.,And in wing’d accents thus the Chief address’d.
15178,BOOK XVIII.,"Hero! most terrible of men, arise!210"
15179,BOOK XVIII.,"protect Patroclus, for whose sake the war"
15180,BOOK XVIII.,Stands at the fleet of Greece. Mutual prevails
15181,BOOK XVIII.,"The slaughter, these the dead defending, those"
15182,BOOK XVIII.,Resolute hence to drag him to the gates
15183,BOOK XVIII.,Of wind-swept Ilium. But beyond them all215
15184,BOOK XVIII.,"Illustrious Hector, obstinate is bent"
15185,BOOK XVIII.,"To win him, purposing to lop his head,"
15186,BOOK XVIII.,And to exhibit it impaled on high.
15187,BOOK XVIII.,"Thou then arise, nor longer on the ground"
15188,BOOK XVIII.,Lie stretch’d inactive; let the thought with shame220
15189,BOOK XVIII.,"Touch thee, of thy Patroclus made the sport"
15190,BOOK XVIII.,"Of Trojan dogs, whose corse, if it return"
15191,BOOK XVIII.,"Dishonored home, brings with it thy reproach."
15192,BOOK XVIII.,To whom Achilles matchless in the race.
15193,BOOK XVIII.,"Iris divine! of all the Gods, who sent thee?225"
15194,BOOK XVIII.,"Then, thus, the swift ambassadress of heaven."
15195,BOOK XVIII.,"By Juno sent I come, consort of Jove."
15196,BOOK XVIII.,"Nor knows Saturnian Jove high-throned, himself,"
15197,BOOK XVIII.,"My flight, nor any of the Immortal Powers,"
15198,BOOK XVIII.,Tenants of the Olympian heights snow-crown’d.230
15199,BOOK XVIII.,"Her answer’d then Pelides, glorious Chief."
15200,BOOK XVIII.,How shall I seek the fight? they have my arms.
15201,BOOK XVIII.,My mother charged me also to abstain
15202,BOOK XVIII.,"From battle, till she bring me armor new"
15203,BOOK XVIII.,Which she hath promised me from Vulcan’s hand.235
15204,BOOK XVIII.,"Meantime, whose armor else might serve my need"
15205,BOOK XVIII.,"I know not, save perhaps alone the shield"
15206,BOOK XVIII.,"Of Telamonian Ajax, whom I deem"
15207,BOOK XVIII.,"Himself now busied in the stormy van,"
15208,BOOK XVIII.,Slaying the Trojans in my friend’s defence.240
15209,BOOK XVIII.,"To whom the swift-wing’d messenger of heaven,"
15210,BOOK XVIII.,Full well we know thine armor Hector’s prize
15211,BOOK XVIII.,"Yet, issuing to the margin of the foss,"
15212,BOOK XVIII.,"Show thyself only. Panic-seized, perchance,"
15213,BOOK XVIII.,"The Trojans shall from fight desist, and yield245"
15214,BOOK XVIII.,To the o’ertoil’d though dauntless sons of Greece
15215,BOOK XVIII.,Short respite; it is all that war allows.
15216,BOOK XVIII.,"So saying, the storm-wing’d Iris disappear’d."
15217,BOOK XVIII.,"Then rose at once Achilles dear to Jove,"
15218,BOOK XVIII.,Athwart whose shoulders broad Minerva cast250
15219,BOOK XVIII.,"Her Ægis fringed terrific, and his brows"
15220,BOOK XVIII.,Encircled with a golden cloud that shot
15221,BOOK XVIII.,Fires insupportable to sight abroad.
15222,BOOK XVIII.,"As when some island, situate afar"
15223,BOOK XVIII.,"On the wide waves, invested all the day255"
15224,BOOK XVIII.,"By cruel foes from their own city pour’d,"
15225,BOOK XVIII.,"Upsends a smoke to heaven, and torches shows"
15226,BOOK XVIII.,On all her turrets at the close of eve
15227,BOOK XVIII.,"Which flash against the clouds, kindled in hope"
15228,BOOK XVIII.,"Of aid from neighbor maritime allies,260"
15229,BOOK XVIII.,So from Achilles’ head light flash’d to heaven.
15230,BOOK XVIII.,"Issuing through the wall, beside the foss"
15231,BOOK XVIII.,"He stood, but mix’d not with Achaia’s host,"
15232,BOOK XVIII.,Obedient to his mother’s wise command.
15233,BOOK XVIII.,He stood and shouted; Pallas also raised265
15234,BOOK XVIII.,A dreadful shout and tumult infinite
15235,BOOK XVIII.,Excited throughout all the host of Troy.
15236,BOOK XVIII.,Clear as the trumpet’s note when it proclaims
15237,BOOK XVIII.,A numerous host approaching to invest
15238,BOOK XVIII.,"Some city close around, so clear the voice270"
15239,BOOK XVIII.,"Rang of Æacides, and tumult-toss’d"
15240,BOOK XVIII.,Was every soul that heard the brazen tone.
15241,BOOK XVIII.,With swift recoil the long-maned coursers thrust
15242,BOOK XVIII.,"The chariots back, all boding wo at hand,"
15243,BOOK XVIII.,And every charioteer astonish’d saw275
15244,BOOK XVIII.,"Fires that fail’d not, illumining the brows"
15245,BOOK XVIII.,"Of Peleus’ son, by Pallas kindled there."
15246,BOOK XVIII.,Thrice o’er the trench Achilles sent his voice
15247,BOOK XVIII.,"Sonorous, and confusion at the sound"
15248,BOOK XVIII.,"Thrice seized the Trojans, and their famed allies.280"
15249,BOOK XVIII.,Twelve in that moment of their noblest died
15250,BOOK XVIII.,"By their own spears and chariots, and with joy"
15251,BOOK XVIII.,The Grecians from beneath a hill of darts
15252,BOOK XVIII.,"Dragging Patroclus, placed him on his bier."
15253,BOOK XVIII.,"Around him throng’d his fellow-warriors bold,285"
15254,BOOK XVIII.,"All weeping, after whom Achilles went"
15255,BOOK XVIII.,Fast-weeping also at the doleful sight
15256,BOOK XVIII.,Of his true friend on his funereal bed
15257,BOOK XVIII.,"Extended, gash’d with many a mortal wound,"
15258,BOOK XVIII.,Whom he had sent into the fight with steeds290
15259,BOOK XVIII.,"And chariot, but received him thence no more."
15260,BOOK XVIII.,"And now majestic Juno sent the sun,"
15261,BOOK XVIII.,"Unwearied minister of light, although"
15262,BOOK XVIII.,"Reluctant, down into the Ocean stream.[5]"
15263,BOOK XVIII.,"So the sun sank, and the Achaians ceased295"
15264,BOOK XVIII.,From the all-wasting labors of the war.
15265,BOOK XVIII.,"On the other side, the Trojans, from the fight"
15266,BOOK XVIII.,"Retiring, loosed their steeds, but ere they took"
15267,BOOK XVIII.,"Thought of refreshment, in full council met."
15268,BOOK XVIII.,"It was a council at which no man sat,300"
15269,BOOK XVIII.,Or dared; all stood; such terror had on all
15270,BOOK XVIII.,"Fallen, for that Achilles had appear’d,"
15271,BOOK XVIII.,After long pause from battle’s arduous toil.
15272,BOOK XVIII.,First rose Polydamas the prudent son
15273,BOOK XVIII.,"Of Panthus, above all the Trojans skill’d305"
15274,BOOK XVIII.,Both in futurity and in the past.
15275,BOOK XVIII.,"He was the friend of Hector, and one night"
15276,BOOK XVIII.,Gave birth to both. In council one excell’d
15277,BOOK XVIII.,And one still more in feats of high renown.
15278,BOOK XVIII.,"Thus then, admonishing them, he began.310"
15279,BOOK XVIII.,My friends! weigh well the occasion. Back to Troy
15280,BOOK XVIII.,"By my advice, nor wait the sacred morn"
15281,BOOK XVIII.,"Here, on the plain, from Ilium’s walls remote"
15282,BOOK XVIII.,So long as yet the anger of this Chief
15283,BOOK XVIII.,"’Gainst noble Agamemnon burn’d, so long315"
15284,BOOK XVIII.,"We found the Greeks less formidable foes,"
15285,BOOK XVIII.,"And I rejoiced, myself, spending the night"
15286,BOOK XVIII.,"Beside their oary barks, for that I hoped"
15287,BOOK XVIII.,To seize them; but I now tremble at thought
15288,BOOK XVIII.,Of Peleus’ rapid son again in arms.320
15289,BOOK XVIII.,A spirit proud as his will scorn to fight
15290,BOOK XVIII.,"Here, on the plain, where Greeks and Trojans take"
15291,BOOK XVIII.,"Their common share of danger and of toil,"
15292,BOOK XVIII.,"And will at once strike at your citadel,"
15293,BOOK XVIII.,Impatient till he make your wives his prey.325
15294,BOOK XVIII.,Haste—let us home—else thus shall it befall;
15295,BOOK XVIII.,Night’s balmy influence in his tent detains
15296,BOOK XVIII.,"Achilles now, but rushing arm’d abroad"
15297,BOOK XVIII.,"To-morrow, should he find us lingering here,"
15298,BOOK XVIII.,None shall mistake him then; happy the man330
15299,BOOK XVIII.,"Who soonest, then, shall ’scape to sacred Troy!"
15300,BOOK XVIII.,"Then, dogs shall make and vultures on our flesh"
15301,BOOK XVIII.,Plenteous repast. Oh spare mine ears the tale!
15302,BOOK XVIII.,"But if, though troubled, ye can yet receive"
15303,BOOK XVIII.,"My counsel, thus assembled we will keep335"
15304,BOOK XVIII.,"Strict guard to-night; meantime, her gates and towers"
15305,BOOK XVIII.,"With all their mass of solid timbers, smooth"
15306,BOOK XVIII.,"And cramp’d with bolts of steel, will keep the town."
15307,BOOK XVIII.,But early on the morrow we will stand
15308,BOOK XVIII.,"All arm’d on Ilium’s towers. Then, if he choose,340"
15309,BOOK XVIII.,"His galleys left, to compass Troy about,"
15310,BOOK XVIII.,He shall be task’d enough; his lofty steeds
15311,BOOK XVIII.,Shall have their fill of coursing to and fro
15312,BOOK XVIII.,"Beneath, and gladly shall to camp return."
15313,BOOK XVIII.,"But waste the town he shall not, nor attempt345"
15314,BOOK XVIII.,With all the utmost valor that he boasts
15315,BOOK XVIII.,To force a pass; dogs shall devour him first.
15316,BOOK XVIII.,"To whom brave Hector louring, and in wrath."
15317,BOOK XVIII.,"Polydamas, I like not thy advice"
15318,BOOK XVIII.,"Who bidd’st us in our city skulk, again350"
15319,BOOK XVIII.,Imprison’d there. Are ye not yet content?
15320,BOOK XVIII.,Wish ye for durance still in your own towers?
15321,BOOK XVIII.,"Time was, when in all regions under heaven"
15322,BOOK XVIII.,Men praised the wealth of Priam’s city stored
15323,BOOK XVIII.,With gold and brass; but all our houses now355
15324,BOOK XVIII.,Stand emptied of their hidden treasures rare.
15325,BOOK XVIII.,Jove in his wrath hath scatter’d them; our wealth
15326,BOOK XVIII.,"Is marketed, and Phrygia hath a part"
15327,BOOK XVIII.,"Purchased, and part Mæonia’s lovely land."
15328,BOOK XVIII.,But since the son of wily Saturn old360
15329,BOOK XVIII.,"Hath given me glory now, and to inclose"
15330,BOOK XVIII.,"The Grecians in their fleet hemm’d by the sea,"
15331,BOOK XVIII.,Fool! taint not with such talk the public mind.
15332,BOOK XVIII.,For not a Trojan here will thy advice
15333,BOOK XVIII.,"Follow, or shall; it hath not my consent.365"
15334,BOOK XVIII.,"But thus I counsel. Let us, band by band,"
15335,BOOK XVIII.,"Throughout the host take supper, and let each,"
15336,BOOK XVIII.,"Guarded against nocturnal danger, watch."
15337,BOOK XVIII.,And if a Trojan here be rack’d in mind
15338,BOOK XVIII.,"Lest his possessions perish, let him cast370"
15339,BOOK XVIII.,"His golden heaps into the public maw,[6]"
15340,BOOK XVIII.,Far better so consumed than by the Greeks.
15341,BOOK XVIII.,"Then, with the morrow’s dawn, all fair array’d"
15342,BOOK XVIII.,"In battle, we will give them at their fleet"
15343,BOOK XVIII.,"Sharp onset, and if Peleus’ noble son375"
15344,BOOK XVIII.,"Have risen indeed to conflict for the ships,"
15345,BOOK XVIII.,The worse for him. I shall not for his sake
15346,BOOK XVIII.,"Avoid the deep-toned battle, but will firm"
15347,BOOK XVIII.,Oppose his utmost. Either he shall gain
15348,BOOK XVIII.,"Or I, great glory. Mars his favors deals380"
15349,BOOK XVIII.,"Impartial, and the slayer oft is slain."
15350,BOOK XVIII.,"So counsell’d Hector, whom with shouts of praise"
15351,BOOK XVIII.,"The Trojans answer’d:—fools, and by the power"
15352,BOOK XVIII.,Of Pallas of all sober thought bereft!
15353,BOOK XVIII.,"For all applauded Hector, who had given385"
15354,BOOK XVIII.,"Advice pernicious, and Polydamas,"
15355,BOOK XVIII.,Whose counsel was discreet and wholesome none.
15356,BOOK XVIII.,So then they took repast. But all night long
15357,BOOK XVIII.,"The Grecians o’er Patroclus wept aloud,"
15358,BOOK XVIII.,"While, standing in the midst, Pelides led390"
15359,BOOK XVIII.,"The lamentation, heaving many a groan,"
15360,BOOK XVIII.,And on the bosom of his breathless friend
15361,BOOK XVIII.,"Imposing, sad, his homicidal hands."
15362,BOOK XVIII.,"As the grim lion, from whose gloomy lair"
15363,BOOK XVIII.,Among thick trees the hunter hath his whelps395
15364,BOOK XVIII.,"Purloin’d, too late returning mourns his loss,"
15365,BOOK XVIII.,"Then, up and down, the length of many a vale"
15366,BOOK XVIII.,"Courses, exploring fierce the robber’s foot,"
15367,BOOK XVIII.,"Incensed as he, and with a sigh deep-drawn"
15368,BOOK XVIII.,Thus to his Myrmidons Achilles spake.400
15369,BOOK XVIII.,"How vain, alas! my word spoken that day"
15370,BOOK XVIII.,"At random, when to soothe the hero’s fears"
15371,BOOK XVIII.,"Menœtius, then our guest, I promised him"
15372,BOOK XVIII.,"His noble son at Opoeis again,"
15373,BOOK XVIII.,Living and laden with the spoils of Troy!405
15374,BOOK XVIII.,"But Jove performs not all the thoughts of man,"
15375,BOOK XVIII.,For we were both destined to tinge the soil
15376,BOOK XVIII.,"Of Ilium with our blood, nor I shall see,"
15377,BOOK XVIII.,"Myself, my father in his mansion more"
15378,BOOK XVIII.,"Or Thetis, but must find my burial here.410"
15379,BOOK XVIII.,"Yet, my Patroclus! since the earth expects"
15380,BOOK XVIII.,"Me next, I will not thy funereal rites"
15381,BOOK XVIII.,"Finish, till I shall bring both head and arms"
15382,BOOK XVIII.,"Of that bold Chief who slew thee, to my tent."
15383,BOOK XVIII.,"I also will smite off, before thy pile,415"
15384,BOOK XVIII.,"The heads of twelve illustrious sons of Troy,"
15385,BOOK XVIII.,"Resentful of thy death. Meantime, among"
15386,BOOK XVIII.,"My lofty galleys thou shalt lie, with tears"
15387,BOOK XVIII.,Mourn’d day and night by Trojan captives fair
15388,BOOK XVIII.,"And Dardan compassing thy bier around,420"
15389,BOOK XVIII.,"Whom we, at price of labor hard, ourselves"
15390,BOOK XVIII.,With massy spears toiling in battle took
15391,BOOK XVIII.,"From many an opulent city, now no more."
15392,BOOK XVIII.,"So saying, he bade his train surround with fire"
15393,BOOK XVIII.,"A tripod huge, that they might quickly cleanse425"
15394,BOOK XVIII.,Patroclus from all stain of clotted gore.
15395,BOOK XVIII.,They on the blazing hearth a tripod placed
15396,BOOK XVIII.,"Capacious, fill’d with water its wide womb,"
15397,BOOK XVIII.,"And thrust dry wood beneath, till, fierce, the flames"
15398,BOOK XVIII.,"Embraced it round, and warm’d the flood within.430"
15399,BOOK XVIII.,Soon as the water in the singing brass
15400,BOOK XVIII.,"Simmer’d, they bathed him, and with limpid oil"
15401,BOOK XVIII.,"Anointed; filling, next, his ruddy wounds"
15402,BOOK XVIII.,"With unguent mellow’d by nine circling years,"
15403,BOOK XVIII.,"They stretch’d him on his bed, then cover’d him435"
15404,BOOK XVIII.,"From head to feet with linen texture light,"
15405,BOOK XVIII.,"And with a wide unsullied mantle, last.[7]"
15406,BOOK XVIII.,All night the Myrmidons around the swift
15407,BOOK XVIII.,"Achilles stood, deploring loud his friend,"
15408,BOOK XVIII.,And Jove his spouse and sister thus bespake.440
15409,BOOK XVIII.,"So then, Imperial Juno! not in vain"
15410,BOOK XVIII.,Thou hast the swift Achilles sought to rouse
15411,BOOK XVIII.,"Again to battle; the Achaians, sure,"
15412,BOOK XVIII.,"Are thy own children, thou hast borne them all."
15413,BOOK XVIII.,To whom the awful Goddess ample-eyed.445
15414,BOOK XVIII.,"What word hath pass’d thy lips, Jove, most severe?"
15415,BOOK XVIII.,"A man, though mortal merely, and to me"
15416,BOOK XVIII.,"Inferior in device, might have achieved"
15417,BOOK XVIII.,That labor easily. Can I who boast
15418,BOOK XVIII.,"Myself the chief of Goddesses, and such450"
15419,BOOK XVIII.,"Not by birth only, but as thine espoused,"
15420,BOOK XVIII.,"Who art thyself sovereign of all the Gods,"
15421,BOOK XVIII.,Can I with anger burn against the house
15422,BOOK XVIII.,"Of Priam, and want means of just revenge?"
15423,BOOK XVIII.,
15424,BOOK XVIII.,Thus they in heaven their mutual conference455
15425,BOOK XVIII.,"Meantime, the silver-footed Thetis reach’d"
15426,BOOK XVIII.,"The starr’d abode eternal, brazen wall’d"
15427,BOOK XVIII.,"Of Vulcan, by the builder lame himself"
15428,BOOK XVIII.,"Uprear’d, a wonder even in eyes divine."
15429,BOOK XVIII.,"She found him sweating, at his bellows huge460"
15430,BOOK XVIII.,Toiling industrious; tripods bright he form’d
15431,BOOK XVIII.,"Twenty at once, his palace-wall to grace"
15432,BOOK XVIII.,Ranged in harmonious order. Under each
15433,BOOK XVIII.,"Two golden wheels he set, on which (a sight"
15434,BOOK XVIII.,Marvellous!) into council they should roll465
15435,BOOK XVIII.,"Self-moved, and to his house, self-moved, return."
15436,BOOK XVIII.,"Thus far the work was finish’d, but not yet"
15437,BOOK XVIII.,"Their ears of exquisite design affixt,"
15438,BOOK XVIII.,"For them he stood fashioning, and prepared"
15439,BOOK XVIII.,The rivets. While he thus his matchless skill470
15440,BOOK XVIII.,"Employ’d laborious, to his palace-gate"
15441,BOOK XVIII.,"The silver-footed Thetis now advanced,"
15442,BOOK XVIII.,"Whom Charis, Vulcan’s well-attired spouse,"
15443,BOOK XVIII.,"Beholding from the palace portal, flew"
15444,BOOK XVIII.,"To seize the Goddess’ hand, and thus inquired.475"
15445,BOOK XVIII.,"Why, Thetis! worthy of all reverence"
15446,BOOK XVIII.,"And of all love, comest thou to our abode,"
15447,BOOK XVIII.,"Unfrequent here? But enter, and accept"
15448,BOOK XVIII.,Such welcome as to such a guest is due.
15449,BOOK XVIII.,"So saying, she introduced and to a seat480"
15450,BOOK XVIII.,Led her with argent studs border’d around
15451,BOOK XVIII.,"And foot-stool’d sumptuously;[8] then, calling forth"
15452,BOOK XVIII.,"Her spouse, the glorious artist, thus she said."
15453,BOOK XVIII.,"Haste, Vulcan! Thetis wants thee; linger not."
15454,BOOK XVIII.,To whom the artist of the skies replied.485
15455,BOOK XVIII.,"A Goddess then, whom with much cause I love"
15456,BOOK XVIII.,"And venerate is here, who when I fell"
15457,BOOK XVIII.,"Saved me, what time my shameless mother sought"
15458,BOOK XVIII.,"To cast me, because lame, out of all sight;"
15459,BOOK XVIII.,"Then had I been indeed forlorn, had not490"
15460,BOOK XVIII.,Eurynome the daughter of the Deep
15461,BOOK XVIII.,And Thetis in their laps received me fallen.
15462,BOOK XVIII.,"Nine years with them residing, for their use"
15463,BOOK XVIII.,"I form’d nice trinkets, clasps, rings, pipes, and chains,"
15464,BOOK XVIII.,While loud around our hollow cavern roar’d495
15465,BOOK XVIII.,"The surge of the vast deep, nor God nor man,"
15466,BOOK XVIII.,"Save Thetis and Eurynome, my life’s"
15467,BOOK XVIII.,"Preservers, knew where I was kept conceal’d."
15468,BOOK XVIII.,"Since, therefore, she is come, I cannot less"
15469,BOOK XVIII.,Than recompense to Thetis amber-hair’d500
15470,BOOK XVIII.,With readiness the boon of life preserved.
15471,BOOK XVIII.,"Haste, then, and hospitably spread the board"
15472,BOOK XVIII.,"For her regale, while with my best dispatch"
15473,BOOK XVIII.,I lay my bellows and my tools aside.
15474,BOOK XVIII.,"He spake, and vast in bulk and hot with toil505"
15475,BOOK XVIII.,Rose limping from beside his anvil-stock
15476,BOOK XVIII.,"Upborne, with pain on legs tortuous and weak."
15477,BOOK XVIII.,"First, from the forge dislodged he thrust apart"
15478,BOOK XVIII.,"His bellows, and his tools collecting all"
15479,BOOK XVIII.,"Bestow’d them, careful, in a silver chest,510"
15480,BOOK XVIII.,Then all around with a wet sponge he wiped
15481,BOOK XVIII.,"His visage, and his arms and brawny neck"
15482,BOOK XVIII.,"Purified, and his shaggy breast from smutch;"
15483,BOOK XVIII.,"Last, putting on his vest, he took in hand"
15484,BOOK XVIII.,"His sturdy staff, and shuffled through the door.515"
15485,BOOK XVIII.,Beside the King of fire two golden forms
15486,BOOK XVIII.,"Majestic moved, that served him in the place"
15487,BOOK XVIII.,"Of handmaids; young they seem’d, and seem’d alive,"
15488,BOOK XVIII.,"Nor want they intellect, or speech, or force,"
15489,BOOK XVIII.,Or prompt dexterity by the Gods inspired.520
15490,BOOK XVIII.,"These his supporters were, and at his side"
15491,BOOK XVIII.,"Attendant diligent, while he, with gait"
15492,BOOK XVIII.,"Uncouth, approaching Thetis where she sat"
15493,BOOK XVIII.,"On a bright throne, seized fast her hand and said,"
15494,BOOK XVIII.,"Why, Thetis! worthy as thou art of love525"
15495,BOOK XVIII.,"And of all reverence, hast thou arrived,"
15496,BOOK XVIII.,"Unfrequent here? Speak—tell me thy desire,"
15497,BOOK XVIII.,"Nor doubt my services, if thou demand"
15498,BOOK XVIII.,"Things possible, and possible to me."
15499,BOOK XVIII.,"Then Thetis, weeping plenteously, replied.530"
15500,BOOK XVIII.,Oh Vulcan! Is there on Olympius’ heights
15501,BOOK XVIII.,A Goddess with such load of sorrow press’d
15502,BOOK XVIII.,"As, in peculiar, Jove assigns to me?"
15503,BOOK XVIII.,"Me only, of all ocean-nymphs, he made"
15504,BOOK XVIII.,"Spouse to a man, Peleus Æacides,535"
15505,BOOK XVIII.,"Whose bed, although reluctant and perforce,"
15506,BOOK XVIII.,"I yet endured to share. He now, the prey"
15507,BOOK XVIII.,"Of cheerless age, decrepid lies, and Jove"
15508,BOOK XVIII.,Still other woes heaps on my wretched head.
15509,BOOK XVIII.,"He gave me to bring forth, gave me to rear540"
15510,BOOK XVIII.,"A son illustrious, valiant, and the chief"
15511,BOOK XVIII.,"Of heroes; he, like a luxuriant plant"
15512,BOOK XVIII.,"Upran[9] to manhood, while his lusty growth"
15513,BOOK XVIII.,I nourish’d as the husbandman his vine
15514,BOOK XVIII.,"Set in a fruitful field, and being grown545"
15515,BOOK XVIII.,I sent him early in his gallant fleet
15516,BOOK XVIII.,"Embark’d, to combat with the sons of Troy;"
15517,BOOK XVIII.,"But him from fight return’d I shall receive,"
15518,BOOK XVIII.,"Beneath the roof of Peleus, never more,"
15519,BOOK XVIII.,And while he lives and on the sun his eyes550
15520,BOOK XVIII.,"Opens, affliction is his certain doom,"
15521,BOOK XVIII.,Nor aid resides or remedy in me.
15522,BOOK XVIII.,"The virgin, his own portion of the spoils,"
15523,BOOK XVIII.,Allotted to him by the Grecians—her
15524,BOOK XVIII.,"Atrides, King of men, resumed, and grief555"
15525,BOOK XVIII.,Devour’d Achilles’ spirit for her sake.
15526,BOOK XVIII.,"Meantime, the Trojans shutting close within"
15527,BOOK XVIII.,"Their camp the Grecians, have forbidden them"
15528,BOOK XVIII.,"All egress, and the senators of Greece"
15529,BOOK XVIII.,Have sought with splendid gifts to soothe my son.560
15530,BOOK XVIII.,"He, indisposed to rescue them himself"
15531,BOOK XVIII.,"From ruin, sent, instead, Patroclus forth,"
15532,BOOK XVIII.,"Clad in his own resplendent armor, Chief"
15533,BOOK XVIII.,Of the whole host of Myrmidons. Before
15534,BOOK XVIII.,"The Scæan gate from morn to eve they fought,565"
15535,BOOK XVIII.,"And on that self-same day had Ilium fallen,"
15536,BOOK XVIII.,"But that Apollo, to advance the fame"
15537,BOOK XVIII.,"Of Hector, slew Menœtius’ noble son"
15538,BOOK XVIII.,Full-flush’d with victory. Therefore at thy knees
15539,BOOK XVIII.,"Suppliant I fall, imploring from thine art570"
15540,BOOK XVIII.,"A shield and helmet, greaves of shapely form"
15541,BOOK XVIII.,"With clasps secured, and corselet for my son."
15542,BOOK XVIII.,"For those, once his, his faithful friend hath lost,"
15543,BOOK XVIII.,"Slain by the Trojans, and Achilles lies,"
15544,BOOK XVIII.,"Himself, extended mournful on the ground.575"
15545,BOOK XVIII.,Her answer’d then the artist of the skies.
15546,BOOK XVIII.,Courage! Perplex not with these cares thy soul.
15547,BOOK XVIII.,"I would that when his fatal hour shall come,"
15548,BOOK XVIII.,I could as sure secrete him from the stroke
15549,BOOK XVIII.,"Of destiny, as he shall soon have arms580"
15550,BOOK XVIII.,"Illustrious, such as each particular man"
15551,BOOK XVIII.,"Of thousands, seeing them, shall wish his own."
15552,BOOK XVIII.,"He said, and to his bellows quick repair’d,"
15553,BOOK XVIII.,Which turning to the fire he bade them heave.
15554,BOOK XVIII.,Full twenty bellows working all at once595
15555,BOOK XVIII.,"Breathed on the furnace, blowing easy and free"
15556,BOOK XVIII.,"The managed winds, now forcible, as best"
15557,BOOK XVIII.,"Suited dispatch, now gentle, if the will"
15558,BOOK XVIII.,Of Vulcan and his labor so required.
15559,BOOK XVIII.,"Impenetrable brass, tin, silver, gold,590"
15560,BOOK XVIII.,"He cast into the forge, then, settling firm"
15561,BOOK XVIII.,"His ponderous anvil on the block, one hand"
15562,BOOK XVIII.,"With his huge hammer fill’d, one with the tongs."
15563,BOOK XVIII.,[10]He fashion’d first a shield massy and broad
15564,BOOK XVIII.,"Of labor exquisite, for which he form’d595"
15565,BOOK XVIII.,"A triple border beauteous, dazzling bright,"
15566,BOOK XVIII.,And loop’d it with a silver brace behind.
15567,BOOK XVIII.,"The shield itself with five strong folds he forged,"
15568,BOOK XVIII.,And with devices multiform the disk
15569,BOOK XVIII.,"Capacious charged, toiling with skill divine.600"
15570,BOOK XVIII.,"There he described the earth, the heaven, the sea,"
15571,BOOK XVIII.,"The sun that rests not, and the moon full-orb’d."
15572,BOOK XVIII.,"There also, all the stars which round about"
15573,BOOK XVIII.,"As with a radiant frontlet bind the skies,"
15574,BOOK XVIII.,"The Pleiads and the Hyads, and the might605"
15575,BOOK XVIII.,"Of huge Orion, with him Ursa call’d,"
15576,BOOK XVIII.,"Known also by his popular name, the Wain,"
15577,BOOK XVIII.,That spins around the pole looking toward
15578,BOOK XVIII.,"Orion, only star of these denied"
15579,BOOK XVIII.,To slake his beams in ocean’s briny baths.610
15580,BOOK XVIII.,Two splendid cities also there he form’d
15581,BOOK XVIII.,Such as men build. In one were to be seen
15582,BOOK XVIII.,Rites matrimonial solemnized with pomp
15583,BOOK XVIII.,Of sumptuous banquets; from their chambers forth
15584,BOOK XVIII.,Leading the brides they usher’d them along615
15585,BOOK XVIII.,"With torches through the streets, and sweet was heard"
15586,BOOK XVIII.,The voice around of Hymenæal song.
15587,BOOK XVIII.,Here striplings danced in circles to the sound
15588,BOOK XVIII.,"Of pipe and harp, while in the portals stood"
15589,BOOK XVIII.,"Women, admiring, all, the gallant show.620"
15590,BOOK XVIII.,Elsewhere was to be seen in council met
15591,BOOK XVIII.,The close-throng’d multitude. There strife arose.
15592,BOOK XVIII.,Two citizens contended for a mulct
15593,BOOK XVIII.,The price of blood. This man affirm’d the fine
15594,BOOK XVIII.,"All paid,[11] haranguing vehement the crowd,625"
15595,BOOK XVIII.,"That man denied that he had aught received,"
15596,BOOK XVIII.,And to the judges each made his appeal
15597,BOOK XVIII.,"Eager for their award. Meantime the people,"
15598,BOOK XVIII.,"As favor sway’d them, clamor’d loud for each."
15599,BOOK XVIII.,The heralds quell’d the tumult; reverend sat630
15600,BOOK XVIII.,"On polish’d stones the elders in a ring,"
15601,BOOK XVIII.,"Each with a herald’s sceptre in his hand,"
15602,BOOK XVIII.,"Which holding they arose, and all in turn"
15603,BOOK XVIII.,Gave sentence. In the midst two talents lay
15604,BOOK XVIII.,"Of gold, his destined recompense whose voice635"
15605,BOOK XVIII.,Decisive should pronounce the best award.
15606,BOOK XVIII.,The other city by two glittering hosts
15607,BOOK XVIII.,"Invested stood, and a dispute arose"
15608,BOOK XVIII.,"Between the hosts, whether to burn the town"
15609,BOOK XVIII.,"And lay all waste, or to divide the spoil.640"
15610,BOOK XVIII.,"Meantime, the citizens, still undismay’d,"
15611,BOOK XVIII.,"Surrender’d not the town, but taking arms"
15612,BOOK XVIII.,"Secretly, set the ambush in array,"
15613,BOOK XVIII.,And on the walls their wives and children kept
15614,BOOK XVIII.,"Vigilant guard, with all the ancient men.645"
15615,BOOK XVIII.,They sallied; at their head Pallas and Mars
15616,BOOK XVIII.,Both golden and in golden vests attired
15617,BOOK XVIII.,"Advanced, proportion each showing divine,"
15618,BOOK XVIII.,"Large, prominent, and such as Gods beseem’d."
15619,BOOK XVIII.,"Not such the people, but of humbler size.650"
15620,BOOK XVIII.,"Arriving at the spot for ambush chosen,"
15621,BOOK XVIII.,"A river’s side, where cattle of each kind"
15622,BOOK XVIII.,"Drank, down they sat, all arm’d in dazzling brass."
15623,BOOK XVIII.,Apart from all the rest sat also down
15624,BOOK XVIII.,"Two spies, both looking for the flocks and herds.655"
15625,BOOK XVIII.,"Soon they appear’d, and at their side were seen"
15626,BOOK XVIII.,"Two shepherd swains, each playing on his pipe"
15627,BOOK XVIII.,"Careless, and of the danger nought apprized,"
15628,BOOK XVIII.,"Swift ran the spies, perceiving their approach,"
15629,BOOK XVIII.,And intercepting suddenly the herds660
15630,BOOK XVIII.,"And flocks of silver fleece, slew also those"
15631,BOOK XVIII.,"Who fed them. The besiegers, at that time"
15632,BOOK XVIII.,"In council, by the sound alarm’d, their steeds"
15633,BOOK XVIII.,"Mounted, and hasted, instant, to the place;"
15634,BOOK XVIII.,"Then, standing on the river’s brink they fought665"
15635,BOOK XVIII.,And push’d each other with the brazen lance.
15636,BOOK XVIII.,"There Discord raged, there Tumult, and the force"
15637,BOOK XVIII.,Of ruthless Destiny; she now a Chief
15638,BOOK XVIII.,"Seized newly wounded, and now captive held"
15639,BOOK XVIII.,"Another yet unhurt, and now a third670"
15640,BOOK XVIII.,Dragg’d breathless through the battle by his feet
15641,BOOK XVIII.,And all her garb was dappled thick with blood
15642,BOOK XVIII.,"Like living men they traversed and they strove,"
15643,BOOK XVIII.,And dragg’d by turns the bodies of the slain.
15644,BOOK XVIII.,He also graved on it a fallow field675
15645,BOOK XVIII.,"Rich, spacious, and well-till’d. Plowers not few,"
15646,BOOK XVIII.,"There driving to and fro their sturdy teams,"
15647,BOOK XVIII.,Labor’d the land; and oft as in their course
15648,BOOK XVIII.,"They came to the field’s bourn, so oft a man"
15649,BOOK XVIII.,"Met them, who in their hands a goblet placed680"
15650,BOOK XVIII.,"Charged with delicious wine. They, turning, wrought"
15651,BOOK XVIII.,"Each his own furrow, and impatient seem’d"
15652,BOOK XVIII.,"To reach the border of the tilth, which black"
15653,BOOK XVIII.,"Appear’d behind them as a glebe new-turn’d,"
15654,BOOK XVIII.,Though golden. Sight to be admired by all!685
15655,BOOK XVIII.,There too he form’d the likeness of a field
15656,BOOK XVIII.,"Crowded with corn, in which the reapers toil’d"
15657,BOOK XVIII.,Each with a sharp-tooth’d sickle in his hand.
15658,BOOK XVIII.,"Along the furrow here, the harvest fell"
15659,BOOK XVIII.,"In frequent handfuls, there, they bound the sheaves.690"
15660,BOOK XVIII.,Three binders of the sheaves their sultry task
15661,BOOK XVIII.,"All plied industrious, and behind them boys"
15662,BOOK XVIII.,"Attended, filling with the corn their arms"
15663,BOOK XVIII.,And offering still their bundles to be bound.
15664,BOOK XVIII.,"Amid them, staff in hand, the master stood695"
15665,BOOK XVIII.,"Silent exulting, while beneath an oak"
15666,BOOK XVIII.,"Apart, his heralds busily prepared"
15667,BOOK XVIII.,"The banquet, dressing a well-thriven ox"
15668,BOOK XVIII.,"New slain, and the attendant maidens mix’d"
15669,BOOK XVIII.,Large supper for the hinds of whitest flour.700
15670,BOOK XVIII.,"There also, laden with its fruit he form’d"
15671,BOOK XVIII.,A vineyard all of gold; purple he made
15672,BOOK XVIII.,"The clusters, and the vines supported stood"
15673,BOOK XVIII.,By poles of silver set in even rows.
15674,BOOK XVIII.,"The trench he color’d sable, and around705"
15675,BOOK XVIII.,Fenced it with tin. One only path it show’d
15676,BOOK XVIII.,By which the gatherers when they stripp’d the vines
15677,BOOK XVIII.,"Pass’d and repass’d. There, youths and maidens blithe"
15678,BOOK XVIII.,"In frails of wicker bore the luscious fruit,"
15679,BOOK XVIII.,"While, in the midst, a boy on his shrill harp710"
15680,BOOK XVIII.,"Harmonious play’d, still as he struck the chord"
15681,BOOK XVIII.,Carolling to it with a slender voice.
15682,BOOK XVIII.,"They smote the ground together, and with song"
15683,BOOK XVIII.,And sprightly reed came dancing on behind.[12]
15684,BOOK XVIII.,There too a herd he fashion’d of tall beeves715
15685,BOOK XVIII.,"Part gold, part tin. They, lowing, from the stalls"
15686,BOOK XVIII.,Rush’d forth to pasture by a river-side
15687,BOOK XVIII.,"Rapid, sonorous, fringed with whispering reeds."
15688,BOOK XVIII.,Four golden herdsmen drove the kine a-field
15689,BOOK XVIII.,By nine swift dogs attended. Dreadful sprang720
15690,BOOK XVIII.,"Two lions forth, and of the foremost herd"
15691,BOOK XVIII.,"Seized fast a bull. Him bellowing they dragg’d,"
15692,BOOK XVIII.,While dogs and peasants all flew to his aid.
15693,BOOK XVIII.,The lions tore the hide of the huge prey
15694,BOOK XVIII.,And lapp’d his entrails and his blood. Meantime725
15695,BOOK XVIII.,"The herdsmen, troubling them in vain, their hounds"
15696,BOOK XVIII.,Encouraged; but no tooth for lions’ flesh
15697,BOOK XVIII.,"Found they, and therefore stood aside and bark’d."
15698,BOOK XVIII.,"There also, the illustrious smith divine"
15699,BOOK XVIII.,Amidst a pleasant grove a pasture form’d730
15700,BOOK XVIII.,"Spacious, and sprinkled o’er with silver sheep"
15701,BOOK XVIII.,"Numerous, and stalls and huts and shepherds’ tents."
15702,BOOK XVIII.,"To these the glorious artist added next,"
15703,BOOK XVIII.,"With various skill delineated exact,"
15704,BOOK XVIII.,"A labyrinth for the dance, such as of old735"
15705,BOOK XVIII.,In Crete’s broad island Dædalus composed
15706,BOOK XVIII.,For bright-hair’d Ariadne.[13] There the youths
15707,BOOK XVIII.,"And youth-alluring maidens, hand in hand,"
15708,BOOK XVIII.,"Danced jocund, every maiden neat-attired"
15709,BOOK XVIII.,"In finest linen, and the youths in vests740"
15710,BOOK XVIII.,"Well-woven, glossy as the glaze of oil."
15711,BOOK XVIII.,"These all wore garlands, and bright falchions, those,"
15712,BOOK XVIII.,Of burnish’d gold in silver trappings hung:—[14]
15713,BOOK XVIII.,"They with well-tutor’d step, now nimbly ran"
15714,BOOK XVIII.,"The circle, swift, as when, before his wheel745"
15715,BOOK XVIII.,"Seated, the potter twirls it with both hands"
15716,BOOK XVIII.,"For trial of its speed,[15] now, crossing quick"
15717,BOOK XVIII.,They pass’d at once into each other’s place.
15718,BOOK XVIII.,On either side spectators numerous stood
15719,BOOK XVIII.,"Delighted, and two tumblers roll’d themselves750"
15720,BOOK XVIII.,"Between the dancers, singing as they roll’d."
15721,BOOK XVIII.,"Last, with the might of ocean’s boundless flood"
15722,BOOK XVIII.,He fill’d the border of the wondrous shield.
15723,BOOK XVIII.,When thus the massy shield magnificent
15724,BOOK XVIII.,"He had accomplish’d, for the hero next755"
15725,BOOK XVIII.,"He forged, more ardent than the blaze of fire,"
15726,BOOK XVIII.,"A corselet; then, a ponderous helmet bright"
15727,BOOK XVIII.,"Well fitted to his brows, crested with gold,"
15728,BOOK XVIII.,And with laborious art divine adorn’d.
15729,BOOK XVIII.,He also made him greaves of molten tin.760
15730,BOOK XVIII.,"The armor finish’d, bearing in his hand"
15731,BOOK XVIII.,"The whole, he set it down at Thetis’ feet."
15732,BOOK XVIII.,"She, like a falcon from the snowy top"

15752,BOOK XIX.,"From ocean, with new day for Gods and men,"
15753,BOOK XIX.,"When Thetis at the fleet of Greece arrived,"
15754,BOOK XIX.,Bearing that gift divine. She found her son
15755,BOOK XIX.,"All tears, and close enfolding in his arms5"
15756,BOOK XIX.,"Patroclus, while his Myrmidons around"
15757,BOOK XIX.,"Wept also;[1] she amid them, graceful, stood,"
15758,BOOK XIX.,"And seizing fast his hand, him thus bespake."
15759,BOOK XIX.,"Although our loss be great, yet, oh my son!"
15760,BOOK XIX.,Leave we Patroclus lying on the bier10
15761,BOOK XIX.,To which the Gods ordain’d him from the first.
15762,BOOK XIX.,"Receive from Vulcan’s hands these glorious arms,"
15763,BOOK XIX.,Such as no mortal shoulders ever bore.
15764,BOOK XIX.,"So saying, she placed the armor on the ground"
15765,BOOK XIX.,"Before him, and the whole bright treasure rang.15"
15766,BOOK XIX.,A tremor shook the Myrmidons; none dared
15767,BOOK XIX.,"Look on it, but all fled. Not so himself."
15768,BOOK XIX.,"In him fresh vengeance kindled at the view,"
15769,BOOK XIX.,"And, while he gazed, a splendor as of fire"
15770,BOOK XIX.,"Flash’d from his eyes. Delighted, in his hand20"
15771,BOOK XIX.,"He held the glorious bounty of the God,"
15772,BOOK XIX.,"And, wondering at those strokes of art divine,"
15773,BOOK XIX.,His eager speech thus to his mother turn’d.[2]
15774,BOOK XIX.,"The God, my mother! hath bestow’d in truth"
15775,BOOK XIX.,Such armor on me as demanded skill25
15776,BOOK XIX.,"Like his, surpassing far all power of man."
15777,BOOK XIX.,"Now, therefore, I will arm. But anxious fears"
15778,BOOK XIX.,"Trouble me, lest intrusive flies, meantime,"
15779,BOOK XIX.,Breed worms within the spear-inflicted wounds
15780,BOOK XIX.,"Of Menœtiades, and fill with taint30"
15781,BOOK XIX.,Of putrefaction his whole breathless form.[3]
15782,BOOK XIX.,But him the silver-footed Goddess fair
15783,BOOK XIX.,"Thus answer’d. Oh, my son! chase from thy mind"
15784,BOOK XIX.,"All such concern. I will, myself, essay"
15785,BOOK XIX.,To drive the noisome swarms which on the slain35
15786,BOOK XIX.,In battle feed voracious. Should he lie
15787,BOOK XIX.,"The year complete, his flesh shall yet be found"
15788,BOOK XIX.,"Untainted, and, it may be, fragrant too."
15789,BOOK XIX.,But thou the heroes of Achaia’s host
15790,BOOK XIX.,"Convening, in their ears thy wrath renounce40"
15791,BOOK XIX.,"Against the King of men, then, instant, arm"
15792,BOOK XIX.,"For battle, and put on thy glorious might."
15793,BOOK XIX.,"So saying, the Goddess raised his courage high."
15794,BOOK XIX.,"Then, through the nostrils of the dead she pour’d"
15795,BOOK XIX.,"Ambrosia, and the ruddy juice divine45"
15796,BOOK XIX.,"Of nectar, antidotes against decay."
15797,BOOK XIX.,And now forth went Achilles by the side
15798,BOOK XIX.,"Of ocean, calling with a dreadful shout"
15799,BOOK XIX.,To council all the heroes of the host.[4]
15800,BOOK XIX.,"Then, even they who in the fleet before50"
15801,BOOK XIX.,"Constant abode, helmsmen and those who held"
15802,BOOK XIX.,"In stewardship the food and public stores,"
15803,BOOK XIX.,"All flock’d to council, for that now at length"
15804,BOOK XIX.,After long abstinence from dread exploits
15805,BOOK XIX.,"Of war, Achilles had once more appear’d.55"
15806,BOOK XIX.,"Two went together, halting on the spear,"
15807,BOOK XIX.,(For still they felt the anguish of their wounds)
15808,BOOK XIX.,"Noble Ulysses and brave Diomede,"
15809,BOOK XIX.,And took an early seat; whom follow’d last
15810,BOOK XIX.,"The King of men, by Coön in the field60"
15811,BOOK XIX.,Of furious battle wounded with a lance.
15812,BOOK XIX.,"The Grecians all assembled, in the midst"

15814,BOOK XIX.,Atrides! we had doubtless better sped
15815,BOOK XIX.,"Both thou and I, thus doing, when at first65"
15816,BOOK XIX.,"With cruel rage we burn’d, a girl the cause."
15817,BOOK XIX.,I would that Dian’s shaft had in the fleet
15818,BOOK XIX.,Slain her that self-same day when I destroy’d
15819,BOOK XIX.,"Lyrnessus, and by conquest made her mine!"
15820,BOOK XIX.,"Then had not many a Grecian, lifeless now,70"
15821,BOOK XIX.,"Clench’d with his teeth the ground, victim, alas!"
15822,BOOK XIX.,Of my revenge; whence triumph hath accrued
15823,BOOK XIX.,"To Hector and his host, while ours have cause"
15824,BOOK XIX.,For long remembrance of our mutual strife.
15825,BOOK XIX.,"But evils past let pass, yielding perforce75"
15826,BOOK XIX.,To sad necessity. My wrath shall cease
15827,BOOK XIX.,Now; I resign it; it hath burn’d too long.
15828,BOOK XIX.,"Thou therefore summon forth the host to fight,"
15829,BOOK XIX.,"That I may learn meeting them in the field,"
15830,BOOK XIX.,If still the Trojans purpose at our fleet80
15831,BOOK XIX.,To watch us this night also. But I judge
15832,BOOK XIX.,"That driven by my spear to rapid flight,"
15833,BOOK XIX.,They shall escape with weary limbs[5] at least.
15834,BOOK XIX.,"He ended, and the Grecians brazen-greaved"
15835,BOOK XIX.,Rejoiced that Peleus’ mighty son had cast85
15836,BOOK XIX.,His wrath aside. Then not into the midst
15837,BOOK XIX.,"Proceeding, but at his own seat, upstood"
15838,BOOK XIX.,"King Agamemnon, and them thus bespake."
15839,BOOK XIX.,
15840,BOOK XIX.,Friends! Grecian heroes! Ministers of Mars!

15842,BOOK XIX.,"All interruption wrongs him, and distracts,"

15844,BOOK XIX.,"Amid the roar of tumult, or who speak?"
15845,BOOK XIX.,"The clearest voice, best utterance, both are vain"
15846,BOOK XIX.,I shall address Achilles. Hear my speech95
15847,BOOK XIX.,"Ye Argives, and with understanding mark."
15848,BOOK XIX.,I hear not now the voice of your reproach[6]
15849,BOOK XIX.,First; ye have oft condemn’d me. Yet the blame
15850,BOOK XIX.,"Rests not with me; Jove, Destiny, and she"
15851,BOOK XIX.,"Who roams the shades, Erynnis, caused the offence.100"
15852,BOOK XIX.,She fill’d my soul with fury on that day
15853,BOOK XIX.,"In council, when I seized Achilles’ prize."
15854,BOOK XIX.,For what could I? All things obey the Gods.
15855,BOOK XIX.,"Ate, pernicious Power, daughter of Jove,"
15856,BOOK XIX.,"By whom all suffer, challenges from all105"
15857,BOOK XIX.,Reverence and fear. Delicate are her feet

15861,BOOK XIX.,"She injured, on a day, dread Jove himself110"
15862,BOOK XIX.,"Most excellent of all in earth or heaven,"
15863,BOOK XIX.,"When Juno, although female, him deceived,"
15864,BOOK XIX.,What time Alcmena should have brought to light
15865,BOOK XIX.,In bulwark’d Thebes the force of Hercules.
15866,BOOK XIX.,"Then Jove, among the gods glorying, spake.115"
15867,BOOK XIX.,"Hear all! both Gods and Goddesses, attend!"
15868,BOOK XIX.,That I may make my purpose known. This day
15869,BOOK XIX.,Birth-pang-dispensing Ilithya brings
15870,BOOK XIX.,"An hero forth to light, who, sprung from those"
15871,BOOK XIX.,"That sprang from me, his empire shall extend120"
15872,BOOK XIX.,Over all kingdoms bordering on his own.
15873,BOOK XIX.,"To whom, designing fraud, Juno replied."
15874,BOOK XIX.,"Thou wilt be found false, and this word of thine"
15875,BOOK XIX.,Shall want performance. But Olympian Jove!
15876,BOOK XIX.,"Swear now the inviolable oath, that he125"
15877,BOOK XIX.,"Who shall, this day, fall from between the feet"
15878,BOOK XIX.,"Of woman, drawing his descent from thee,"
15879,BOOK XIX.,Shall rule all kingdoms bordering on his own.
15880,BOOK XIX.,"She said, and Jove, suspecting nought her wiles,"
15881,BOOK XIX.,"The great oath swore, to his own grief and wrong.130"
15882,BOOK XIX.,At once from the Olympian summit flew
15883,BOOK XIX.,"Juno, and to Achaian Argos borne,"
15884,BOOK XIX.,"There sought the noble wife[7] of Sthenelus,"
15885,BOOK XIX.,Offspring of Perseus. Pregnant with a son
15886,BOOK XIX.,"Six months, she now the seventh saw at hand,135"
15887,BOOK XIX.,"But him the Goddess premature produced,"
15888,BOOK XIX.,And check’d Alcmena’s pangs already due.
15889,BOOK XIX.,"Then joyful to have so prevail’d, she bore"
15890,BOOK XIX.,Herself the tidings to Saturnian Jove.
15891,BOOK XIX.,Lord of the candent lightnings! Sire of all!140
15892,BOOK XIX.,"I bring thee tidings. The great prince, ordain’d"
15893,BOOK XIX.,"To rule the Argive race, this day is born,"
15894,BOOK XIX.,"Eurystheus, son of Sthenelus, the son"
15895,BOOK XIX.,"Of Perseus; therefore he derives from thee,"
15896,BOOK XIX.,Nor shall the throne of Argos shame his birth.145
15897,BOOK XIX.,She spake; then anguish stung the heart of Jove
15898,BOOK XIX.,"Deeply, and seizing by her glossy locks"
15899,BOOK XIX.,"The Goddess Ate, in his wrath he swore"
15900,BOOK XIX.,That never to the starry skies again
15901,BOOK XIX.,And the Olympian heights he would permit150
15902,BOOK XIX.,The universal mischief to return.
15903,BOOK XIX.,"Then, whirling her around, he cast her down"
15904,BOOK XIX.,"To earth. She, mingling with all works of men,"
15905,BOOK XIX.,"Caused many a pang to Jove, who saw his son"
15906,BOOK XIX.,"Laborious tasks servile, and of his birth155"
15907,BOOK XIX.,"Unworthy, at Eurystheus’ will enjoin’d."
15908,BOOK XIX.,So when the hero Hector at our ships
15909,BOOK XIX.,"Slew us, I then regretted my offence"
15910,BOOK XIX.,Which Ate first impell’d me to commit.
15911,BOOK XIX.,"But since, infatuated by the Gods160"
15912,BOOK XIX.,"I err’d, behold me ready to appease"
15913,BOOK XIX.,With gifts of price immense whom I have wrong’d.
15914,BOOK XIX.,"Thou, then, arise to battle, and the host"
15915,BOOK XIX.,Rouse also. Not a promise yesternight
15916,BOOK XIX.,Was made thee by Ulysses in thy tent165
15917,BOOK XIX.,"On my behalf, but shall be well perform’d."
15918,BOOK XIX.,"Or if it please thee, though impatient, wait"
15919,BOOK XIX.,"Short season, and my train shall bring the gifts"
15920,BOOK XIX.,Even now; that thou may’st understand and know
15921,BOOK XIX.,That my peace-offerings are indeed sincere.170
15922,BOOK XIX.,"To whom Achilles, swiftest of the swift."
15923,BOOK XIX.,Atrides! Agamemnon! passing all
15924,BOOK XIX.,In glory! King of men! recompense just
15925,BOOK XIX.,"By gifts to make me, or to make me none,"
15926,BOOK XIX.,That rests with thee. But let us to the fight175
15927,BOOK XIX.,Incontinent. It is no time to play
15928,BOOK XIX.,"The game of rhetoric, and to waste the hours"
15929,BOOK XIX.,In speeches. Much remains yet unperform’d.
15930,BOOK XIX.,Achilles must go forth. He must be seen
15931,BOOK XIX.,"Once more in front of battle, wasting wide180"
15932,BOOK XIX.,"With brazen spear, the crowded ranks of Troy."
15933,BOOK XIX.,"Mark him—and as he fights, fight also ye."
15934,BOOK XIX.,To whom Ulysses ever-wise replied.
15935,BOOK XIX.,"Nay—urge not, valiant as thou art thyself,"
15936,BOOK XIX.,Achaia’s sons up to the battlements185
15937,BOOK XIX.,"Of Ilium, by repast yet unrefresh’d,"
15938,BOOK XIX.,Godlike Achilles!—For when phalanx once
15939,BOOK XIX.,"Shall clash with phalanx, and the Gods with rage"
15940,BOOK XIX.,"Both hosts inspire, the contest shall not then"
15941,BOOK XIX.,Prove short. Bid rather the Achaians take190
15942,BOOK XIX.,"Both food and wine, for they are strength and might."
15943,BOOK XIX.,To stand all day till sunset to a foe
15944,BOOK XIX.,"Opposed in battle, fasting, were a task"
15945,BOOK XIX.,Might foil the best; for though his will be prompt
15946,BOOK XIX.,"To combat, yet the power must by degrees195"
15947,BOOK XIX.,"Forsake him; thirst and hunger he must feel,"
15948,BOOK XIX.,And his limbs failing him at every step.
15949,BOOK XIX.,But he who hath his vigor to the full
15950,BOOK XIX.,"Fed with due nourishment, although he fight"
15951,BOOK XIX.,"All day, yet feels his courage unimpair’d,200"
15952,BOOK XIX.,Nor weariness perceives till all retire.
15953,BOOK XIX.,Come then—dismiss the people with command
15954,BOOK XIX.,That each prepare replenishment. Meantime
15955,BOOK XIX.,"Let Agamemnon, King of men, his gifts"
15956,BOOK XIX.,In presence here of the assembled Greeks205
15957,BOOK XIX.,"Produce, that all may view them, and that thou"
15958,BOOK XIX.,May’st feel thine own heart gladden’d at the sight.
15959,BOOK XIX.,"Let the King also, standing in the midst,"
15960,BOOK XIX.,"Swear to thee, that he renders back the maid"
15961,BOOK XIX.,"A virgin still, and strange to his embrace,210"
15962,BOOK XIX.,"And let thy own composure prove, the while,"
15963,BOOK XIX.,"That thou art satisfied. Last, let him spread"
15964,BOOK XIX.,"A princely banquet for thee in his tent,"
15965,BOOK XIX.,That thou may’st want no part of just amends.
15966,BOOK XIX.,"Thou too, Atrides, shalt hereafter prove215"
15967,BOOK XIX.,"More just to others; for himself, a King,"
15968,BOOK XIX.,"Stoops not too low, soothing whom he hath wrong’d."
15969,BOOK XIX.,"Him Agamemnon answer’d, King of men."
15970,BOOK XIX.,"Thou hast arranged wisely the whole concern,"
15971,BOOK XIX.,"O Läertiades, and I have heard220"
15972,BOOK XIX.,"Thy speech, both words and method with delight."
15973,BOOK XIX.,"Willing I am, yea more, I wish to swear"
15974,BOOK XIX.,"As thou hast said, for by the Gods I can"
15975,BOOK XIX.,"Most truly. Let Achilles, though of pause"
15976,BOOK XIX.,"Impatient, suffer yet a short delay225"
15977,BOOK XIX.,"With all assembled here, till from my tent"
15978,BOOK XIX.,"The gifts arrive, and oaths of peace be sworn."
15979,BOOK XIX.,To thee I give it in peculiar charge
15980,BOOK XIX.,That choosing forth the most illustrious youths
15981,BOOK XIX.,"Of all Achaia, thou produce the gifts230"
15982,BOOK XIX.,"from my own ship, all those which yesternight"
15983,BOOK XIX.,"We promised, nor the women leave behind."
15984,BOOK XIX.,And let Talthybius throughout all the camp
15985,BOOK XIX.,"Of the Achaians, instant, seek a boar"
15986,BOOK XIX.,For sacrifice to Jove and to the Sun.235
15987,BOOK XIX.,Then thus Achilles matchless in the race.
15988,BOOK XIX.,Atrides! most illustrious! King of men!
15989,BOOK XIX.,Expedience bids us to these cares attend
15990,BOOK XIX.,"Hereafter, when some pause, perchance, of fight"
15991,BOOK XIX.,"Shall happen, and the martial rage which fires240"
15992,BOOK XIX.,"My bosom now, shall somewhat less be felt."
15993,BOOK XIX.,"Our friends by Priameian Hector slain,"
15994,BOOK XIX.,"Now strew the field mangled, for him hath Jove"
15995,BOOK XIX.,"Exalted high, and given him great renown."
15996,BOOK XIX.,"But haste, now take refreshment; though, in truth245"
15997,BOOK XIX.,"Might I direct, the host should by all means"
15998,BOOK XIX.,"Unfed to battle, and at set of sun"
15999,BOOK XIX.,"All sup together, this affront revenged."
16000,BOOK XIX.,"But as for me, no drop shall pass my lips"
16001,BOOK XIX.,"Or morsel, whose companion lies with feet250"
16002,BOOK XIX.,"Turn’d to the vestibule, pierced by the spear,"
16003,BOOK XIX.,And compass’d by my weeping train around.
16004,BOOK XIX.,No want of food feel I. My wishes call
16005,BOOK XIX.,"For carnage, blood, and agonies and groans."
16006,BOOK XIX.,"But him, excelling in all wisdom, thus255"
16007,BOOK XIX.,Ulysses answer’d. Oh Achilles! son
16008,BOOK XIX.,Of Peleus! bravest far of all our host!
16009,BOOK XIX.,"Me, in no scanty measure, thou excell’st"
16010,BOOK XIX.,"Wielding the spear, and thee in prudence, I"
16011,BOOK XIX.,"Not less. For I am elder, and have learn’d260"
16012,BOOK XIX.,What thou hast yet to learn. Bid then thine heart
16013,BOOK XIX.,Endure with patience to be taught by me.
16014,BOOK XIX.,"Men, satiate soon with battle, loathe the field"
16015,BOOK XIX.,"On which the most abundant harvest falls,"
16016,BOOK XIX.,Reap’d by the sword; and when the hand of Jove265
16017,BOOK XIX.,"Dispenser of the great events of war,"
16018,BOOK XIX.,"Turns once the scale, then, farewell every hope"
16019,BOOK XIX.,Of more than scanty gleanings. Shall the Greeks
16020,BOOK XIX.,Abstain from sustenance for all who die?
16021,BOOK XIX.,"That were indeed severe, since day by day270"
16022,BOOK XIX.,"No few expire, and respite could be none."
16023,BOOK XIX.,"The dead, die whoso may, should be inhumed."
16024,BOOK XIX.,"This, duty bids, but bids us also deem"
16025,BOOK XIX.,One day sufficient for our sighs and tears.
16026,BOOK XIX.,"Ourselves, all we who still survive the war,275"
16027,BOOK XIX.,"Have need of sustenance, that we may bear"
16028,BOOK XIX.,"The lengthen’d conflict with recruited might,"
16029,BOOK XIX.,Case in enduring brass.—Ye all have heard
16030,BOOK XIX.,Your call to battle; let none lingering stand
16031,BOOK XIX.,"In expectation of a farther call,280"
16032,BOOK XIX.,"Which if it sound, shall thunder prove to him"
16033,BOOK XIX.,Who lurks among the ships. No. Rush we all
16034,BOOK XIX.,"Together forth, for contest sharp prepared,"
16035,BOOK XIX.,And persevering with the host of Troy.
16036,BOOK XIX.,"So saying, the sons of Nestor, glorious Chief,285"
16037,BOOK XIX.,"He chose, with Meges Phyleus’ noble son,"
16038,BOOK XIX.,"Thoas, Meriones, and Melanippus"
16039,BOOK XIX.,"And Lycomedes. These, together, sought"
16040,BOOK XIX.,"The tent of Agamemnon, King of men."
16041,BOOK XIX.,"They ask’d, and they received. Soon they produced290"
16042,BOOK XIX.,"The seven promised tripods from the tent,"
16043,BOOK XIX.,"Twice ten bright caldrons, twelve high-mettled steeds,"
16044,BOOK XIX.,Seven lovely captives skill’d alike in arts
16045,BOOK XIX.,"Domestic, of unblemish’d beauty rare,"
16046,BOOK XIX.,"And last, Brisëis with the blooming cheeks.295"
16047,BOOK XIX.,"Before them went Ulysses, bearing weigh’d"
16048,BOOK XIX.,"Ten golden talents, whom the chosen Greeks"
16049,BOOK XIX.,Attended laden with the remnant gifts.
16050,BOOK XIX.,Full in the midst they placed them. Then arose
16051,BOOK XIX.,"King Agamemnon, and Talthybius300"
16052,BOOK XIX.,"The herald, clear in utterance as a God,"
16053,BOOK XIX.,"Beside him stood, holding the victim boar."
16054,BOOK XIX.,"Atrides, drawing forth his dagger bright,"
16055,BOOK XIX.,"Appendant ever to his sword’s huge sheath,"
16056,BOOK XIX.,"Sever’d the bristly forelock of the boar,305"
16057,BOOK XIX.,"A previous offering. Next, with lifted hands"
16058,BOOK XIX.,"To Jove he pray’d, while, all around, the Greeks"
16059,BOOK XIX.,Sat listening silent to the Sovereign’s voice.
16060,BOOK XIX.,"He look’d to the wide heaven, and thus he pray’d."
16061,BOOK XIX.,"First, Jove be witness! of all Powers above310"
16062,BOOK XIX.,"Best and supreme; Earth next, and next the Sun!"
16063,BOOK XIX.,"And last, who under Earth the guilt avenge"
16064,BOOK XIX.,"Of oaths sworn falsely, let the Furies hear!"
16065,BOOK XIX.,For no respect of amorous desire
16066,BOOK XIX.,"Or other purpose, have I laid mine hand315"
16067,BOOK XIX.,"On fair Brisëis, but within my tent"
16068,BOOK XIX.,"Untouch’d, immaculate she hath remain’d."
16069,BOOK XIX.,"And if I falsely swear, then may the Gods"
16070,BOOK XIX.,The many woes with which they mark the crime
16071,BOOK XIX.,"Of men forsworn, pour also down on me!320"
16072,BOOK XIX.,"So saying, he pierced the victim in his throat"
16073,BOOK XIX.,"And, whirling him around, Talthybius, next,"
16074,BOOK XIX.,"Cast him into the ocean, fishes’ food.[8]"
16075,BOOK XIX.,"Then, in the centre of Achaia’s sons"
16076,BOOK XIX.,"Uprose Achilles, and thus spake again.325"
16077,BOOK XIX.,"Jove! Father! dire calamities, effects"
16078,BOOK XIX.,"Of thy appointment, fall on human-kind."
16079,BOOK XIX.,Never had Agamemnon in my breast
16080,BOOK XIX.,"Such anger kindled, never had he seized,"
16081,BOOK XIX.,"Blinded by wrath, and torn my prize away,330"
16082,BOOK XIX.,But that the slaughter of our numerous friends
16083,BOOK XIX.,"Which thence ensued, thou hadst, thyself, ordained."
16084,BOOK XIX.,"Now go, ye Grecians, eat, and then to battle."
16085,BOOK XIX.,"So saying, Achilles suddenly dissolved"
16086,BOOK XIX.,"The hasty council, and all flew dispersed335"
16087,BOOK XIX.,To their own ships. Then took the Myrmidons
16088,BOOK XIX.,Those splendid gifts which in the tent they lodged
16089,BOOK XIX.,"Of swift Achilles, and the damsels led"
16090,BOOK XIX.,"Each to a seat, while others of his train"
16091,BOOK XIX.,Drove forth the steeds to pasture with his herd.340
16092,BOOK XIX.,"But when Brisëis, bright as Venus, saw"
16093,BOOK XIX.,"Patroclus lying mangled by the spear,"
16094,BOOK XIX.,"Enfolding him around, she shriek’d and tore"
16095,BOOK XIX.,"Her bosom, her smooth neck and beauteous cheeks."
16096,BOOK XIX.,"Then thus, divinely fair, with tears she said.345"
16097,BOOK XIX.,"Ah, my Patroclus! dearest friend of all"
16098,BOOK XIX.,"To hapless me, departing from this tent"
16099,BOOK XIX.,"I left thee living, and now, generous Chief!"
16100,BOOK XIX.,"Restored to it again, here find thee dead."
16101,BOOK XIX.,How rapid in succession are my woes!350
16102,BOOK XIX.,"I saw, myself, the valiant prince to whom"
16103,BOOK XIX.,"My parents had betroth’d me, slain before"
16104,BOOK XIX.,"Our city walls; and my three brothers, sons"
16105,BOOK XIX.,"Of my own mother, whom with long regret"
16106,BOOK XIX.,"I mourn, fell also in that dreadful field.355"
16107,BOOK XIX.,But when the swift Achilles slew the prince
16108,BOOK XIX.,"Design’d my spouse, and the fair city sack’d"
16109,BOOK XIX.,"Of noble Mynes, thou by every art"
16110,BOOK XIX.,"Of tender friendship didst forbid my tears,"
16111,BOOK XIX.,Promising oft that thou would’st make me bride360
16112,BOOK XIX.,"Of Peleus’ godlike son, that thy own ship"
16113,BOOK XIX.,"Should waft me hence to Phthia, and that thyself"
16114,BOOK XIX.,Would’st furnish forth among the Myrmidons
16115,BOOK XIX.,Our nuptial feast. Therefore thy death I mourn
16116,BOOK XIX.,"Ceaseless, for thou wast ever kind to me.365"
16117,BOOK XIX.,"She spake, and all her fellow-captives heaved"
16118,BOOK XIX.,"Responsive sighs, deploring each, in show,"
16119,BOOK XIX.,"The dead Patroclus, but, in truth, herself.[9]"
16120,BOOK XIX.,Then the Achaian Chiefs gather’d around
16121,BOOK XIX.,"Achilles, wooing him to eat, but he370"
16122,BOOK XIX.,"Groan’d and still resolute, their suit refused—"
16123,BOOK XIX.,If I have here a friend on whom by prayers
16124,BOOK XIX.,"I may prevail, I pray that ye desist,"
16125,BOOK XIX.,"Nor longer press me, mourner as I am,"
16126,BOOK XIX.,"To eat or drink, for till the sun go down375"
16127,BOOK XIX.,"I am inflexible, and _will_ abstain."
16128,BOOK XIX.,"So saying, the other princes he dismiss’d"
16129,BOOK XIX.,"Impatient, but the sons of Atreus both,"
16130,BOOK XIX.,"Ulysses, Nestor and Idomeneus,"
16131,BOOK XIX.,"With Phœnix, hoary warrior, in his tent380"
16132,BOOK XIX.,"Abiding still, with cheerful converse kind"
16133,BOOK XIX.,"Essay’d to soothe him, whose afflicted soul"
16134,BOOK XIX.,All soothing scorn’d till he should once again
16135,BOOK XIX.,Rush on the ravening edge of bloody war.
16136,BOOK XIX.,"Then, mindful of his friend, groaning he said385"
16137,BOOK XIX.,"Time was, unhappiest, dearest of my friends!"
16138,BOOK XIX.,"When even thou, with diligent dispatch,"
16139,BOOK XIX.,"Thyself, hast spread a table in my tent,"
16140,BOOK XIX.,The hour of battle drawing nigh between
16141,BOOK XIX.,The Greeks and warlike Trojans. But there lies390
16142,BOOK XIX.,"Thy body now, gored by the ruthless steel,"
16143,BOOK XIX.,"And for thy sake I neither eat nor drink,"
16144,BOOK XIX.,"Though dearth be none, conscious that other wo"
16145,BOOK XIX.,Surpassing this I can have none to fear.
16146,BOOK XIX.,"No, not if tidings of my father’s death395"
16147,BOOK XIX.,"Should reach me, who, this moment, weeps, perhaps,"
16148,BOOK XIX.,In Phthia tears of tenderest regret
16149,BOOK XIX.,"For such a son; while I, remote from home"
16150,BOOK XIX.,Fight for detested Helen under Troy.
16151,BOOK XIX.,"Nor even were _he_ dead, whom, if he live,400"
16152,BOOK XIX.,"I rear in Scyros, my own darling son,"
16153,BOOK XIX.,My Neoptolemus of form divine.[10]
16154,BOOK XIX.,For still this hope I cherish’d in my breast
16155,BOOK XIX.,"Till now, that, of us two, myself alone"
16156,BOOK XIX.,"Should fall at Ilium, and that thou, restored405"
16157,BOOK XIX.,"To Phthia, should’st have wafted o’er the waves"
16158,BOOK XIX.,"My son from Scyros to his native home,"
16159,BOOK XIX.,"That thou might’st show him all his heritage,"
16160,BOOK XIX.,"My train of menials, and my fair abode."
16161,BOOK XIX.,For either dead already I account410
16162,BOOK XIX.,"Peleus, or doubt not that his residue"
16163,BOOK XIX.,"Of miserable life shall soon be spent,"
16164,BOOK XIX.,Through stress of age and expectation sad
16165,BOOK XIX.,"That tidings of my death shall, next, arrive."
16166,BOOK XIX.,"So spake Achilles weeping, around whom415"
16167,BOOK XIX.,"The Chiefs all sigh’d, each with remembrance pain’d"
16168,BOOK XIX.,Of some loved object left at home. Meantime
16169,BOOK XIX.,"Jove, with compassion moved, their sorrow saw,"
16170,BOOK XIX.,And in wing’d accents thus to Pallas spake.
16171,BOOK XIX.,
16172,BOOK XIX.,"Daughter! thou hast abandon’d, as it seems,420"
16173,BOOK XIX.,Yon virtuous Chief for ever; shall no care
16174,BOOK XIX.,Thy mind engage of brave Achilles more?
16175,BOOK XIX.,Before his gallant fleet mourning he sits
16176,BOOK XIX.,"His friend, disconsolate; the other Greeks"
16177,BOOK XIX.,Sat and are satisfied; he only fasts.425
16178,BOOK XIX.,"Go then—instil nectar into his breast,"
16179,BOOK XIX.,"And sweets ambrosial, that he hunger not."
16180,BOOK XIX.,"So saying, he urged Minerva prompt before."
16181,BOOK XIX.,In form a shrill-voiced Harpy of long wing
16182,BOOK XIX.,"Through ether down she darted, while the Greeks430"
16183,BOOK XIX.,In all their camp for instant battle arm’d.
16184,BOOK XIX.,Ambrosial sweets and nectar she instill’d
16185,BOOK XIX.,"Into his breast, lest he should suffer loss"
16186,BOOK XIX.,"Of strength through abstinence, then soar’d again"
16187,BOOK XIX.,To her great Sire’s unperishing abode.435
16188,BOOK XIX.,And now the Grecians from their gallant fleet
16189,BOOK XIX.,All pour’d themselves abroad. As when thick snow
16190,BOOK XIX.,"From Jove descends, driven by impetuous gusts"
16191,BOOK XIX.,"Of the cloud-scattering North, so frequent shone"
16192,BOOK XIX.,"Issuing from the fleet the dazzling casques,440"
16193,BOOK XIX.,"Boss’d bucklers, hauberks strong, and ashen spears."
16194,BOOK XIX.,Upwent the flash to heaven; wide all around
16195,BOOK XIX.,"The champain laugh’d with beamy brass illumed,"
16196,BOOK XIX.,And tramplings of the warriors on all sides
16197,BOOK XIX.,"Resounded, amidst whom Achilles arm’d.445"
16198,BOOK XIX.,"He gnash’d his teeth, fire glimmer’d in his eyes,"
16199,BOOK XIX.,Anguish intolerable wrung his heart
16200,BOOK XIX.,"And fury against Troy, while he put on"
16201,BOOK XIX.,"His glorious arms, the labor of a God."
16202,BOOK XIX.,"First, to his legs his polish’d greaves he clasp’d450"
16203,BOOK XIX.,"Studded with silver, then his corselet bright"
16204,BOOK XIX.,"Braced to his bosom, his huge sword of brass"
16205,BOOK XIX.,"Athwart his shoulder slung, and his broad shield"
16206,BOOK XIX.,"Uplifted last, luminous as the moon."
16207,BOOK XIX.,"Such as to mariners a fire appears,455"
16208,BOOK XIX.,Kindled by shepherds on the distant top
16209,BOOK XIX.,"Of some lone hill; they, driven by stormy winds,"
16210,BOOK XIX.,"Reluctant roam far off the fishy deep,"

16212,BOOK XIX.,A lustre struck the skies; his ponderous helm460
16213,BOOK XIX.,"He lifted to his brows; starlike it shone,"
16214,BOOK XIX.,"And shook its curling crest of bushy gold,"
16215,BOOK XIX.,By Vulcan taught to wave profuse around.
16216,BOOK XIX.,"So clad, godlike Achilles trial made"
16217,BOOK XIX.,"If his arms fitted him, and gave free scope465"
16218,BOOK XIX.,To his proportion’d limbs; buoyant they proved
16219,BOOK XIX.,"As wings, and high upbore his airy tread."
16220,BOOK XIX.,"He drew his father’s spear forth from his case,"
16221,BOOK XIX.,"Heavy and huge and long. That spear, of all"
16222,BOOK XIX.,"Achaia’s sons, none else had power to wield;470"
16223,BOOK XIX.,Achilles only could the Pelian spear
16224,BOOK XIX.,"Brandish, by Chiron for his father hewn"
16225,BOOK XIX.,From Pelion’s top for slaughter of the brave.
16226,BOOK XIX.,"His coursers, then, Automedon prepared"

16228,BOOK XIX.,The fair caparisons; they thrust the bits
16229,BOOK XIX.,"Into their mouths, and to the chariot seat"
16230,BOOK XIX.,Extended and made fast the reins behind.
16231,BOOK XIX.,The splendid scourge commodious to the grasp
16232,BOOK XIX.,"Seizing, at once Automedon upsprang480"
16233,BOOK XIX.,"Into his place; behind him, arm’d complete"

16311,BOOK XX.,King of the lightnings! wherefore hast thou call’d
16312,BOOK XX.,The Gods to council? Hast thou aught at heart
16313,BOOK XX.,Important to the hosts of Greece and Troy?
16314,BOOK XX.,For on the battle’s fiery edge they stand.25
16315,BOOK XX.,"To whom replied Jove, Sovereign of the storms,"
16316,BOOK XX.,"Thou know’st my council, Shaker of the shores!"
16317,BOOK XX.,And wherefore ye are call’d. Although ordain’d

16319,BOOK XX.,"Myself, here seated on Olympus’ top,30"
16320,BOOK XX.,With contemplation will my mind indulge
16321,BOOK XX.,"Of yon great spectacle; but ye, the rest,"
16322,BOOK XX.,"Descend into the field, Trojan or Greek"
16323,BOOK XX.,"Each to assist, as each shall most incline."
16324,BOOK XX.,For should Achilles in the field no foe35
16325,BOOK XX.,"Find save the Trojans, quickly should they fly"
16326,BOOK XX.,Before the rapid force of Peleus’ son.
16327,BOOK XX.,"They trembled ever at his look, and since"
16328,BOOK XX.,"Such fury for his friend hath fired his heart,"
16329,BOOK XX.,I fear lest he anticipate the will40

16331,BOOK XX.,So spake the son of Saturn kindling war
16332,BOOK XX.,"Inevitable, and the Gods to fight"

16344,BOOK XX.,"Mixed not with either host, Achaia’s sons55"
16345,BOOK XX.,"Exulted, seeing, after tedious pause,"
16346,BOOK XX.,"Achilles in the field, and terror shook"
16347,BOOK XX.,"The knees of every Trojan, at the sight"
16348,BOOK XX.,Of swift Achilles like another Mars
16349,BOOK XX.,"Panting for blood, and bright in arms again.60"
16350,BOOK XX.,But when the Olympian Powers had enter’d once
16351,BOOK XX.,"The multitude, then Discord, at whose voice"

16372,BOOK XX.,To mortal and immortal eyes his realm
16373,BOOK XX.,"Terrible, squalid, to the Gods themselves"
16374,BOOK XX.,A dreaded spectacle; with such a sound85
16375,BOOK XX.,The Powers eternal into battle rush’d.[4]
16376,BOOK XX.,"Opposed to Neptune, King of the vast Deep,"
16377,BOOK XX.,Apollo stood with his wing’d arrows arm’d;
16378,BOOK XX.,"Pallas to Mars; Diana shaft-expert,"

16384,BOOK XX.,"Scamander call’d, but Xanthus by the Gods.95"
16385,BOOK XX.,So Gods encounter’d Gods. But most desire
16386,BOOK XX.,"Achilles felt, breaking the ranks, to rush"
16387,BOOK XX.,"On Priameian Hector, with whose blood"
16388,BOOK XX.,Chiefly his fury prompted him to sate
16389,BOOK XX.,The indefatigable God of war.100
16390,BOOK XX.,"But, the encourager of Ilium’s host"
16391,BOOK XX.,"Apollo, urged Æneas to assail"
16392,BOOK XX.,"The son of Peleus, with heroic might"
16393,BOOK XX.,Inspiring his bold heart. He feign’d the voice
16394,BOOK XX.,"Of Priam’s son Lycaon, and his form105"
16395,BOOK XX.,"Assuming, thus the Trojan Chief address’d."
16396,BOOK XX.,Æneas! Trojan leader! where are now
16397,BOOK XX.,"Thy vaunts, which, banqueting erewhile among"
16398,BOOK XX.,"Our princes, o’er thy brimming cups thou mad’st,"
16399,BOOK XX.,"That thou would’st fight, thyself, with Peleus’ son?110"
16400,BOOK XX.,To whom Æneas answer thus returned.
16401,BOOK XX.,Offspring of Priam! why enjoin’st thou me
16402,BOOK XX.,"Not so inclined, that arduous task, to cope"
16403,BOOK XX.,With the unmatch’d Achilles? I have proved
16404,BOOK XX.,"His force already, when he chased me down115"
16405,BOOK XX.,"From Ida with his spear, what time he made"
16406,BOOK XX.,"Seizure of all our cattle, and destroy’d"
16407,BOOK XX.,Pedasus and Lyrnessus; but I ’scaped
16408,BOOK XX.,"Unslain, by Jove himself empower’d to fly,"
16409,BOOK XX.,"Else had I fallen by Achilles’ hand,120"
16410,BOOK XX.,"And by the hand of Pallas, who his steps"
16411,BOOK XX.,"Conducted, and exhorted him to slay"
16412,BOOK XX.,"Us and the Leleges.[5] Vain, therefore, proves"
16413,BOOK XX.,All mortal force to Peleus’ son opposed;
16414,BOOK XX.,"For one, at least, of the Immortals stands125"
16415,BOOK XX.,"Ever beside him, guardian of his life,"
16416,BOOK XX.,"And, of himself, he hath an arm that sends"
16417,BOOK XX.,His rapid spear unerring to the mark.
16418,BOOK XX.,"Yet, would the Gods more equal sway the scales"
16419,BOOK XX.,"Of battle, not with ease should he subdue130"
16420,BOOK XX.,"Me, though he boast a panoply of brass."
16421,BOOK XX.,"Him, then, Apollo answer’d, son of Jove."
16422,BOOK XX.,Hero! prefer to the immortal Gods
16423,BOOK XX.,"Thy Prayer, for thee men rumor Venus’ son"
16424,BOOK XX.,Daughter of Jove; and Peleus’ son his birth135
16425,BOOK XX.,Drew from a Goddess of inferior note.
16426,BOOK XX.,"Thy mother is from Jove; the offspring, his,"
16427,BOOK XX.,Less noble of the hoary Ocean old.
16428,BOOK XX.,"Go, therefore, and thy conquering spear uplift"
16429,BOOK XX.,"Against him, nor let aught his sounding words140"
16430,BOOK XX.,"Appal thee, or his threats turn thee away."
16431,BOOK XX.,"So saying, with martial force the Chief he fill’d,"
16432,BOOK XX.,Who through the foremost combatants advanced
16433,BOOK XX.,Radiant in arms. Nor pass’d Anchises’ son
16434,BOOK XX.,"Unseen of Juno, through the crowded ranks145"
16435,BOOK XX.,"Seeking Achilles, but the Powers of heaven"
16436,BOOK XX.,"Convened by her command, she thus address’d."

16442,BOOK XX.,"Be it our task to give him quick repulse,"
16443,BOOK XX.,"Or, of ourselves, let some propitious Power"
16444,BOOK XX.,Strengthen Achilles with a mind exempt155
16445,BOOK XX.,"From terror, and with force invincible."
16446,BOOK XX.,So shall he know that of the Gods above
16447,BOOK XX.,"The mightiest are his friends, with whom compared"
16448,BOOK XX.,"The favorers of Ilium in time past,"
16449,BOOK XX.,"Who stood her guardians in the bloody strife,160"
16450,BOOK XX.,"Are empty boasters all, and nothing worth."
16451,BOOK XX.,"For therefore came we down, that we may share"

16453,BOOK XX.,"Fatal to-day, though suffer all he must"
16454,BOOK XX.,"Hereafter, with his thread of life entwined165"
16455,BOOK XX.,"By Destiny, the day when he was born."
16456,BOOK XX.,But should Achilles unapprized remain
16457,BOOK XX.,"Of such advantage by a voice divine,"
16458,BOOK XX.,"When he shall meet some Deity in the field,"
16459,BOOK XX.,"Fear then will seize him, for celestial forms170"
16460,BOOK XX.,Unveil’d are terrible to mortal eyes.
16461,BOOK XX.,To whom replied the Shaker of the shores.
16462,BOOK XX.,Juno! thy hot impatience needs control;
16463,BOOK XX.,It ill befits thee. No desire I feel
16464,BOOK XX.,To force into contention with ourselves175
16465,BOOK XX.,"Gods, our inferiors. No. Let us, retired"
16466,BOOK XX.,"To yonder hill, distant from all resort,"
16467,BOOK XX.,"There sit, while these the battle wage alone."
16468,BOOK XX.,"But if Apollo, or if Mars the fight"
16469,BOOK XX.,"Entering, begin, themselves, to interfere180"
16470,BOOK XX.,"Against Achilles, then will we at once"
16471,BOOK XX.,"To battle also; and, I much misdeem,"
16472,BOOK XX.,Or glad they shall be soon to mix again
16473,BOOK XX.,"Among the Gods on the Olympian heights,"
16474,BOOK XX.,By strong coercion of our arms subdued.185
16475,BOOK XX.,"So saying, the God of Ocean azure-hair’d"
16476,BOOK XX.,Moved foremost to the lofty mound earth-built
16477,BOOK XX.,"Of noble Hercules, by Pallas raised"
16478,BOOK XX.,"And by the Trojans for his safe escape,"
16479,BOOK XX.,What time the monster of the deep pursued190

16485,BOOK XX.,"Callicolone, with their aids divine."
16486,BOOK XX.,"So, Gods to Gods in opposite aspect"
16487,BOOK XX.,"Sat ruminating, and alike the work"
16488,BOOK XX.,"All fearing to begin of arduous war,"
16489,BOOK XX.,While from his seat sublime Jove urged them on.200
16490,BOOK XX.,"The champain all was fill’d, and with the blaze"
16491,BOOK XX.,"Illumined wide of men and steeds brass-arm’d,"
16492,BOOK XX.,And the incumber’d earth jarr’d under foot
16493,BOOK XX.,"Of the encountering hosts. Then, two, the rest"
16494,BOOK XX.,"Surpassing far, into the midst advanced205"
16495,BOOK XX.,"Impatient for the fight, Anchises’ son"
16496,BOOK XX.,"Æneas and Achilles, glorious Chief!"
16497,BOOK XX.,"Æneas first, under his ponderous casque"
16498,BOOK XX.,"Nodding and menacing, advanced; before"
16499,BOOK XX.,His breast he held the well-conducted orb210
16500,BOOK XX.,"Of his broad shield, and shook his brazen spear."
16501,BOOK XX.,"On the other side, Achilles to the fight"
16502,BOOK XX.,"Flew like a ravening lion, on whose death"
16503,BOOK XX.,"Resolved, the peasants from all quarters meet;"
16504,BOOK XX.,"He, viewing with disdain the foremost, stalks215"
16505,BOOK XX.,"Right on, but smitten by some dauntless youth"
16506,BOOK XX.,"Writhes himself, and discloses his huge fangs"

16511,BOOK XX.,"So, by his valor and his noble mind"
16512,BOOK XX.,"Impell’d, renown’d Achilles moved toward"
16513,BOOK XX.,"Æneas, and, small interval between,"
16514,BOOK XX.,Thus spake the hero matchless in the race.225
16515,BOOK XX.,"Why stand’st thou here, Æneas! thy own band"
16516,BOOK XX.,Left at such distance? Is it that thine heart
16517,BOOK XX.,Glows with ambition to contend with me
16518,BOOK XX.,"In hope of Priam’s honors, and to fill"
16519,BOOK XX.,His throne hereafter in Troy steed-renown’d?230
16520,BOOK XX.,"But shouldst thou slay me, not for that exploit"
16521,BOOK XX.,"Would Priam such large recompense bestow,"
16522,BOOK XX.,"For he hath sons, and hath, beside, a mind"

16524,BOOK XX.,Or have the Trojans of their richest soil235
16525,BOOK XX.,For vineyard apt or plow assign’d thee part
16526,BOOK XX.,"If thou shalt slay me? Difficult, I hope,"
16527,BOOK XX.,"At least, thou shalt experience that emprize."
16528,BOOK XX.,"For, as I think, I have already chased"
16529,BOOK XX.,Thee with my spear. Forgettest thou the day240
16530,BOOK XX.,"When, finding thee alone, I drove thee down"

16542,BOOK XX.,To whom Æneas answer thus return’d.
16543,BOOK XX.,"Pelides! hope not, as I were a boy,"
16544,BOOK XX.,With words to scare me. I have also taunts255

16571,BOOK XX.,"Twelve foals produced, and all so light of foot,"
16572,BOOK XX.,That when they wanton’d in the fruitful field
16573,BOOK XX.,"They swept, and snapp’d it not, the golden ear;"
16574,BOOK XX.,"And when they wanton’d on the boundless deep,285"
16575,BOOK XX.,"They skimm’d the green wave’s frothy ridge, secure."
16576,BOOK XX.,"From Ericthonius sprang Tros, King of Troy,"
16577,BOOK XX.,"And Tros was father of three famous sons,"
16578,BOOK XX.,"Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymede"
16579,BOOK XX.,"Loveliest of human kind, whom for his charms290"
16580,BOOK XX.,"The Gods caught up to heaven, there to abide"
16581,BOOK XX.,"With the immortals, cup-bearer of Jove."
16582,BOOK XX.,"Ilus begat Laomedon, and he"
16583,BOOK XX.,"Five sons, Tithonus, Priam, Clytius,"
16584,BOOK XX.,"Lampus, and Hicetaon, branch of Mars.295"
16585,BOOK XX.,"Assaracus a son begat, by name"
16586,BOOK XX.,"Capys, and Capys in due time his son"
16587,BOOK XX.,"Warlike Anchises, and Anchises me."
16588,BOOK XX.,But Priam is the noble Hector’s sire.[6]
16589,BOOK XX.,"Such is my lineage, and such blood I boast;300"
16590,BOOK XX.,"But valor is from Jove; he, as he wills,"
16591,BOOK XX.,"Increases or reduces it in man,"
16592,BOOK XX.,For he is lord of all. Therefore enough—
16593,BOOK XX.,"Too long like children we have stood, the time"
16594,BOOK XX.,"Consuming here, while battle roars around.305"
16595,BOOK XX.,Reproach is cheap. Easily might we cast
16596,BOOK XX.,"Gibes at each other, till a ship that asks"
16597,BOOK XX.,A hundred oars should sink beneath the load.
16598,BOOK XX.,"The tongue of man is voluble, hath words"
16599,BOOK XX.,"For every theme, nor wants wide field and long,310"
16600,BOOK XX.,And as he speaks so shall he hear again.
16601,BOOK XX.,"But we—why should we wrangle, and with taunts"
16602,BOOK XX.,"Assail each other, as the practice is"
16603,BOOK XX.,"Of women, who with heart-devouring strife"
16604,BOOK XX.,"On fire, start forth into the public way315"
16605,BOOK XX.,"To mock each other, uttering, as may chance,"
16606,BOOK XX.,"Much truth, much falsehood, as their anger bids?"
16607,BOOK XX.,The ardor of my courage will not slack
16608,BOOK XX.,For all thy speeches; we must combat first;
16609,BOOK XX.,"Now, therefore, without more delay, begin,320"
16610,BOOK XX.,That we may taste each other’s force in arms.[7]
16611,BOOK XX.,"So spake Æneas, and his brazen lance"
16612,BOOK XX.,Hurl’d with full force against the dreadful shield.
16613,BOOK XX.,Loud roar’d its ample concave at the blow.
16614,BOOK XX.,"Not unalarm’d, Pelides his broad disk325"
16615,BOOK XX.,"Thrust farther from him, deeming that the force"
16616,BOOK XX.,Of such an arm should pierce his guard with ease.
16617,BOOK XX.,Vain fear! he recollected not that arms
16618,BOOK XX.,"Glorious as his, gifts of the immortal Gods,"
16619,BOOK XX.,Yield not so quickly to the force of man.330
16620,BOOK XX.,"The stormy spear by brave Æneas sent,"
16621,BOOK XX.,No passage found; the golden plate divine
16622,BOOK XX.,"Repress’d its vehemence; two folds it pierced,"
16623,BOOK XX.,"But three were still behind, for with five folds"
16624,BOOK XX.,Vulcan had fortified it; two were brass;335
16625,BOOK XX.,"The two interior, tin; the midmost, gold;"
16626,BOOK XX.,And at the golden one the weapon stood.[8]
16627,BOOK XX.,"Achilles next, hurl’d his long shadow’d spear,"
16628,BOOK XX.,And struck Æneas on the utmost verge
16629,BOOK XX.,"Of his broad shield, where thinnest lay the brass,340"
16630,BOOK XX.,And thinnest the ox-hide. The Pelian ash
16631,BOOK XX.,"Started right through the buckler, and it rang."
16632,BOOK XX.,"Æneas crouch’d terrified, and his shield"
16633,BOOK XX.,Thrust farther from him; but the rapid beam
16634,BOOK XX.,"Bursting both borders of the ample disk,345"
16635,BOOK XX.,"Glanced o’er his back, and plunged into the soil."
16636,BOOK XX.,"He ’scaped it, and he stood; but, as he stood,"
16637,BOOK XX.,With horror infinite the weapon saw
16638,BOOK XX.,"Planted so near him. Then, Achilles drew"
16639,BOOK XX.,"His falchion keen, and with a deafening shout350"
16640,BOOK XX.,Sprang on him; but Æneas seized a stone
16641,BOOK XX.,"Heavy and huge, a weight to overcharge"
16642,BOOK XX.,Two men (such men as are accounted strong
16643,BOOK XX.,"Now) but he wielded it with ease, alone."
16644,BOOK XX.,"Then had Æneas, as Achilles came355"
16645,BOOK XX.,"Impetuous on, smitten, although in vain,"
16646,BOOK XX.,"His helmet or his shield, and Peleus’ son"
16647,BOOK XX.,"Had with his falchion him stretch’d at his feet,"
16648,BOOK XX.,But that the God of Ocean quick perceived
16649,BOOK XX.,"His peril, and the Immortals thus bespake.360"
16650,BOOK XX.,"I pity brave Æneas, who shall soon,"
16651,BOOK XX.,"Slain by Achilles, see the realms below,"
16652,BOOK XX.,By smooth suggestions of Apollo lured
16653,BOOK XX.,"To danger, such as he can ne’er avert."
16654,BOOK XX.,"But wherefore should the Chief, guiltless himself,365"
16655,BOOK XX.,Die for the fault of others? at no time
16656,BOOK XX.,"His gifts have fail’d, grateful to all in heaven."
16657,BOOK XX.,"Come, therefore, and let us from death ourselves"
16658,BOOK XX.,"Rescue him, lest if by Achilles’ arm"
16659,BOOK XX.,"This hero perish, Jove himself be wroth;370"
16660,BOOK XX.,"For he is destined to survive, lest all"
16661,BOOK XX.,The house of Dardanus (whom Jove beyond
16662,BOOK XX.,"All others loved, his sons of woman born)"
16663,BOOK XX.,"Fail with Æneas, and be found no more."
16664,BOOK XX.,Saturnian Jove hath hated now long time375
16665,BOOK XX.,"The family of Priam, and henceforth"
16666,BOOK XX.,"Æneas and his son, and his sons’ sons,"
16667,BOOK XX.,Shall sway the sceptre o’er the race of Troy.
16668,BOOK XX.,"To whom, majestic thus the spouse of Jove."
16669,BOOK XX.,"Neptune! deliberate thyself, and choose380"
16670,BOOK XX.,"Whether to save Æneas, or to leave"
16671,BOOK XX.,The hero victim of Achilles’ ire.
16672,BOOK XX.,For Pallas and myself ofttimes have sworn
16673,BOOK XX.,"In full assembly of the Gods, to aid"
16674,BOOK XX.,"Troy never, never to avert the day385"
16675,BOOK XX.,"Of her distress, not even when the flames"
16676,BOOK XX.,"Kindled by the heroic sons of Greece,"
16677,BOOK XX.,Shall climb with fury to her topmost towers.
16678,BOOK XX.,"She spake; then Neptune, instant, through the throng"
16679,BOOK XX.,"Of battle flying, and the clash of spears,390"
16680,BOOK XX.,Came where Achilles and Æneas fought.
16681,BOOK XX.,At once with shadows dim he blurr’d the sight
16682,BOOK XX.,"Of Peleus’ son, and from the shield, himself,"
16683,BOOK XX.,Of brave Æneas the bright-pointed ash
16684,BOOK XX.,"Retracting, placed it at Achilles’ feet.395"
16685,BOOK XX.,"Then, lifting high Æneas from the ground,"
16686,BOOK XX.,He heaved him far remote; o’er many a rank
16687,BOOK XX.,"Of heroes and of bounding steeds he flew,"
16688,BOOK XX.,Launch’d into air from the expanded palm
16689,BOOK XX.,"Of Neptune, and alighted in the rear400"
16690,BOOK XX.,Of all the battle where the Caucons stood.
16691,BOOK XX.,"Neptune approach’d him there, and at his side"
16692,BOOK XX.,"Standing, in accents wing’d, him thus bespake."
16693,BOOK XX.,"What God, Æneas! tempted thee to cope"
16694,BOOK XX.,Thus inconsiderately with the son405
16695,BOOK XX.,"Of Peleus, both more excellent in fight"
16696,BOOK XX.,"Than thou, and more the favorite of the skies?"
16697,BOOK XX.,"From him retire hereafter, or expect"
16698,BOOK XX.,A premature descent into the shades.
16699,BOOK XX.,But when Achilles shall have once fulfill’d410
16700,BOOK XX.,"His destiny, in battle slain, then fight"
16701,BOOK XX.,"Fearless, for thou canst fall by none beside."
16702,BOOK XX.,"So saying, he left the well-admonish’d Chief,"
16703,BOOK XX.,And from Achilles’ eyes scatter’d the gloom
16704,BOOK XX.,Shed o’er them by himself. The hero saw415
16705,BOOK XX.,"Clearly, and with his noble heart incensed"
16706,BOOK XX.,"By disappointment, thus conferring, said."
16707,BOOK XX.,Gods! I behold a prodigy. My spear
16708,BOOK XX.,"Lies at my foot, and he at whom I cast"
16709,BOOK XX.,"The weapon with such deadly force, is gone!420"
16710,BOOK XX.,"Æneas therefore, as it seems, himself"
16711,BOOK XX.,"Interests the immortal Gods, although"
16712,BOOK XX.,I deem’d his boast of their protection vain.
16713,BOOK XX.,I reck not. Let him go. So gladly ’scaped
16714,BOOK XX.,"From slaughter now, he shall not soon again425"
16715,BOOK XX.,Feel an ambition to contend with me.
16716,BOOK XX.,"Now will I rouse the Danaï, and prove"
16717,BOOK XX.,The force in fight of many a Trojan more.
16718,BOOK XX.,"He said, and sprang to battle with loud voice,"
16719,BOOK XX.,Calling the Grecians after him.—Ye sons430
16720,BOOK XX.,"Of the Achaians! stand not now aloof,"
16721,BOOK XX.,My noble friends! but foot to foot let each
16722,BOOK XX.,"Fall on courageous, and desire the fight."
16723,BOOK XX.,"The task were difficult for me alone,"
16724,BOOK XX.,"Brave as I boast myself, to chase a foe435"
16725,BOOK XX.,"So numerous, and to combat with them all."
16726,BOOK XX.,"Not Mars himself, immortal though he be,"
16727,BOOK XX.,"Nor Pallas, could with all the ranks contend"
16728,BOOK XX.,"Of this vast multitude, and drive the whole."
16729,BOOK XX.,"With hands, with feet, with spirit and with might,440"
16730,BOOK XX.,"All that I can I will; right through I go,"
16731,BOOK XX.,And not a Trojan who shall chance within
16732,BOOK XX.,"Spear’s reach of me, shall, as I judge, rejoice."
16733,BOOK XX.,"Thus he the Greeks exhorted. Opposite,"
16734,BOOK XX.,"Meantime, illustrious Hector to his host445"
16735,BOOK XX.,"Vociferated, his design to oppose"
16736,BOOK XX.,Achilles publishing in every ear.
16737,BOOK XX.,"Fear not, ye valiant men of Troy! fear not"
16738,BOOK XX.,The son of Peleus. In a war of words
16739,BOOK XX.,"I could, myself, cope even with the Gods;450"
16740,BOOK XX.,But not with spears; there they excel us all.
16741,BOOK XX.,Nor shall Achilles full performance give
16742,BOOK XX.,"To all his vaunts, but, if he some fulfil,"
16743,BOOK XX.,Shall others leave mutilate in the midst.
16744,BOOK XX.,"I will encounter him, though his hands be fire,455"
16745,BOOK XX.,"Though fire his hands, and his heart hammer’d steel."
16746,BOOK XX.,So spake he them exhorting. At his word
16747,BOOK XX.,"Uprose the Trojan spears, thick intermixt"
16748,BOOK XX.,"The battle join’d, and clamor loud began."
16749,BOOK XX.,"Then thus, approaching Hector, Phœbus spake.460"
16750,BOOK XX.,"Henceforth, advance not Hector! in the front"
16751,BOOK XX.,"Seeking Achilles, but retired within"
16752,BOOK XX.,"The stormy multitude his coming wait,"
16753,BOOK XX.,"Lest his spear reach thee, or his glittering sword."
16754,BOOK XX.,"He said, and Hector far into his host465"
16755,BOOK XX.,"Withdrew, admonish’d by the voice divine."
16756,BOOK XX.,"Then, shouting terrible, and clothed with might,"
16757,BOOK XX.,"Achilles sprang to battle. First, he slew"
16758,BOOK XX.,"The valiant Chief Iphition, whom a band"
16759,BOOK XX.,Numerous obey’d. Otrynteus was his sire.470
16760,BOOK XX.,"Him to Otrynteus, city-waster Chief,"
16761,BOOK XX.,A Naiad under snowy Tmolus bore
16762,BOOK XX.,In fruitful Hyda.[9] Right into his front
16763,BOOK XX.,"As he advanced, Achilles drove his spear,"
16764,BOOK XX.,"And rived his skull; with thundering sound he fell,475"
16765,BOOK XX.,And thus the conqueror gloried in his fall.
16766,BOOK XX.,Ah Otryntides! thou art slain. Here lies
16767,BOOK XX.,"The terrible in arms, who born beside"
16768,BOOK XX.,"The broad Gygæan lake, where Hyllus flows"
16769,BOOK XX.,"And Hermus, call’d the fertile soil his own.480"
16770,BOOK XX.,Thus gloried he. Meantime the shades of death
16771,BOOK XX.,"Cover’d Iphition, and Achaian wheels"
16772,BOOK XX.,And horses ground his body in the van.
16773,BOOK XX.,"Demoleon next, Antenor’s son, a brave"
16774,BOOK XX.,"Defender of the walls of Troy, he slew.485"
16775,BOOK XX.,Into his temples through his brazen casque
16776,BOOK XX.,"He thrust the Pelian ash, nor could the brass"
16777,BOOK XX.,"Such force resist, but the huge weapon drove"
16778,BOOK XX.,"The shatter’d bone into his inmost brain,"
16779,BOOK XX.,And his fierce onset at a stroke repress’d.490
16780,BOOK XX.,Hippodamas his weapon next received
16781,BOOK XX.,"Within his spine, while with a leap he left"
16782,BOOK XX.,"His steeds and fled. He, panting forth his life,"
16783,BOOK XX.,"Moan’d like a bull, by consecrated youths"
16784,BOOK XX.,"Dragg’d round the Heliconian King,[10] who views495"
16785,BOOK XX.,"That victim with delight. So, with loud moans"
16786,BOOK XX.,The noble warrior sigh’d his soul away.
16787,BOOK XX.,"Then, spear in hand, against the godlike son"
16788,BOOK XX.,"Of Priam, Polydorus, he advanced."
16789,BOOK XX.,Not yet his father had to him indulged500
16790,BOOK XX.,"A warrior’s place, for that of all his sons"
16791,BOOK XX.,"He was the youngest-born, his hoary sire’s"
16792,BOOK XX.,"Chief darling, and in speed surpass’d them all."
16793,BOOK XX.,"Then also, in the vanity of youth,"
16794,BOOK XX.,"For show of nimbleness, he started oft505"
16795,BOOK XX.,"Into the vanward, till at last he fell."
16796,BOOK XX.,"Him gliding swiftly by, swifter than he"
16797,BOOK XX.,Achilles with a javelin reach’d; he struck
16798,BOOK XX.,"His belt behind him, where the golden clasps"
16799,BOOK XX.,"Met, and the double hauberk interposed.510"
16800,BOOK XX.,"The point transpierced his bowels, and sprang through"
16801,BOOK XX.,"His navel; screaming, on his knees he fell,"
16802,BOOK XX.,"Death-shadows dimm’d his eyes, and with both hands,"
16803,BOOK XX.,"Stooping, he press’d his gather’d bowels back."
16804,BOOK XX.,"But noble Hector, soon as he beheld515"
16805,BOOK XX.,His brother Polydorus to the earth
16806,BOOK XX.,"Inclined, and with his bowels in his hands,"
16807,BOOK XX.,Sightless well-nigh with anguish could endure
16808,BOOK XX.,No longer to remain aloof; flame-like
16809,BOOK XX.,"He burst abroad,[11] and shaking his sharp spear,520"
16810,BOOK XX.,"Advanced to meet Achilles, whose approach"
16811,BOOK XX.,"Seeing, Achilles bounded with delight,"
16812,BOOK XX.,"And thus, exulting, to himself he said."
16813,BOOK XX.,"Ah! he approaches, who hath stung my soul"
16814,BOOK XX.,"Deepest, the slayer of whom most I loved!525"
16815,BOOK XX.,"Behold, we meet! Caution is at an end,"
16816,BOOK XX.,And timid skulking in the walks of war.
16817,BOOK XX.,"He ceased, and with a brow knit into frowns,"
16818,BOOK XX.,"Call’d to illustrious Hector. Haste, approach,"
16819,BOOK XX.,That I may quick dispatch thee to the shades.530
16820,BOOK XX.,"Whom answer’d warlike Hector, nought appall’d."
16821,BOOK XX.,"Pelides! hope not, as I were a boy,"
16822,BOOK XX.,With words to scare me. I have also taunts
16823,BOOK XX.,"At my command, and can be sharp as thou."
16824,BOOK XX.,"I know thee valiant, and myself I know535"
16825,BOOK XX.,"Inferior far; yet, whether thou shalt slay"
16826,BOOK XX.,"Me, or, inferior as I am, be slain"
16827,BOOK XX.,"By me, is at the pleasure of the Gods,"
16828,BOOK XX.,For I wield also not a pointless beam.
16829,BOOK XX.,"He said, and, brandishing it, hurl’d his spear,540"
16830,BOOK XX.,"Which Pallas, breathing softly, wafted back"
16831,BOOK XX.,"From the renown’d Achilles, and it fell"
16832,BOOK XX.,Successless at illustrious Hector’s feet.
16833,BOOK XX.,"Then, all on fire to slay him, with a shout"
16834,BOOK XX.,That rent the air Achilles rapid flew545
16835,BOOK XX.,Toward him; but him wrapt in clouds opaque
16836,BOOK XX.,Apollo caught with ease divine away.
16837,BOOK XX.,"Thrice, swift Achilles sprang to the assault"
16838,BOOK XX.,"Impetuous, thrice the pitchy cloud he smote,"
16839,BOOK XX.,"And at his fourth assault, godlike in act,550"
16840,BOOK XX.,"And terrible in utterance, thus exclaim’d."
16841,BOOK XX.,"Dog! thou art safe, and hast escaped again;"
16842,BOOK XX.,"But narrowly, and by the aid once more"
16843,BOOK XX.,"Of Phœbus, without previous suit to whom"
16844,BOOK XX.,Thou venturest never where the javelin sings.555
16845,BOOK XX.,"But when we next encounter, then expect,"
16846,BOOK XX.,"If one of all in heaven aid also me,"
16847,BOOK XX.,To close thy proud career. Meantime I seek
16848,BOOK XX.,"Some other, and assail e’en whom I may."
16849,BOOK XX.,"So saying, he pierced the neck of Dryops through,560"
16850,BOOK XX.,"And at his feet he fell. Him there he left,"
16851,BOOK XX.,"And turning on a valiant warrior huge,"
16852,BOOK XX.,"Philetor’s son, Demuchus, in the knee"
16853,BOOK XX.,"Pierced, and detain’d him by the planted spear,"
16854,BOOK XX.,"Till with his sword he smote him, and he died.565"
16855,BOOK XX.,Laogonus and Dardanus he next
16856,BOOK XX.,"Assaulted, sons of Bias; to the ground"
16857,BOOK XX.,"Dismounting both, one with his spear he slew,"
16858,BOOK XX.,The other with his falchion at a blow.
16859,BOOK XX.,"Tros too, Alastor’s son—he suppliant clasp’d570"
16860,BOOK XX.,"Achilles’ knees, and for his pity sued,"
16861,BOOK XX.,"Pleading equality of years, in hope"
16862,BOOK XX.,"That he would spare, and send him thence alive."
16863,BOOK XX.,Ah dreamer! ignorant how much in vain
16864,BOOK XX.,"That suit he urged; for not of milky mind,575"
16865,BOOK XX.,Or placable in temper was the Chief
16866,BOOK XX.,"To whom he sued, but fiery. With both hands"
16867,BOOK XX.,"His knees he clasp’d importunate, and he"
16868,BOOK XX.,Fast by the liver gash’d him with his sword.
16869,BOOK XX.,"His liver falling forth, with sable blood580"
16870,BOOK XX.,"His bosom fill’d, and darkness veil’d his eyes."
16871,BOOK XX.,"Then, drawing close to Mulius, in his ear"
16872,BOOK XX.,"He set the pointed brass, and at a thrust"
16873,BOOK XX.,"Sent it, next moment, through his ear beyond."
16874,BOOK XX.,"Then, through the forehead of Agenor’s son585"
16875,BOOK XX.,"Echechlus, his huge-hafted blade he drove,"
16876,BOOK XX.,And death and fate forever veil’d his eyes.
16877,BOOK XX.,"Next, where the tendons of the elbow meet,"
16878,BOOK XX.,"Striking Deucalion, through his wrist he urged"
16879,BOOK XX.,"The brazen point; he all defenceless stood,590"
16880,BOOK XX.,Expecting death; down came Achilles’ blade
16881,BOOK XX.,Full on his neck; away went head and casque
16882,BOOK XX.,"Together; from his spine the marrow sprang,"
16883,BOOK XX.,And at his length outstretch’d he press’d the plain.
16884,BOOK XX.,"From him to Rhigmus, Pireus’ noble son,595"
16885,BOOK XX.,"He flew, a warrior from the fields of Thrace."
16886,BOOK XX.,"Him through the loins he pierced, and with the beam"
16887,BOOK XX.,"Fixt in his bowels, to the earth he fell;"
16888,BOOK XX.,"Then piercing, as he turn’d to flight, the spine"
16889,BOOK XX.,"Of Areithöus his charioteer,600"
16890,BOOK XX.,He thrust him from his seat; wild with dismay
16891,BOOK XX.,Back flew the fiery coursers at his fall.
16892,BOOK XX.,As a devouring fire within the glens
16893,BOOK XX.,"Of some dry mountain ravages the trees,"
16894,BOOK XX.,"While, blown around, the flames roll to all sides,605"
16895,BOOK XX.,"So, on all sides, terrible as a God,"
16896,BOOK XX.,Achilles drove the death-devoted host
16897,BOOK XX.,"Of Ilium, and the champain ran with blood."
16898,BOOK XX.,As when the peasant his yoked steers employs
16899,BOOK XX.,"To tread his barley, the broad-fronted pair610"
16900,BOOK XX.,"With ponderous hoofs trample it out with ease,"
16901,BOOK XX.,"So, by magnanimous Achilles driven,"

16931,BOOK XXI.,"[1]But when they came, at length, where Xanthus winds"
16932,BOOK XXI.,"His stream vortiginous from Jove derived,"
16933,BOOK XXI.,"There, separating Ilium’s host, he drove"
16934,BOOK XXI.,Part o’er the plain to Troy in the same road
16935,BOOK XXI.,By which the Grecians had so lately fled5
16936,BOOK XXI.,The fury of illustrious Hector’s arm.
16937,BOOK XXI.,That way they fled pouring themselves along
16938,BOOK XXI.,"Flood-like, and Juno, to retard them, threw"
16939,BOOK XXI.,"Darkness as night before them. Other part,"
16940,BOOK XXI.,"Push’d down the sides of Xanthus, headlong plunged10"
16941,BOOK XXI.,"With dashing sound into his dizzy stream,"
16942,BOOK XXI.,And all his banks re-echoed loud the roar.
16943,BOOK XXI.,"They, struggling, shriek’d in silver eddies whirl’d."
16944,BOOK XXI.,"As when, by violence of fire expell’d,"
16945,BOOK XXI.,Locusts uplifted on the wing escape15
16946,BOOK XXI.,"To some broad river, swift the sudden blaze"
16947,BOOK XXI.,"Pursues them, they, astonish’d, strew the flood,[2]"
16948,BOOK XXI.,"So, by Achilles driven, a mingled throng"
16949,BOOK XXI.,Of horses and of warriors overspread
16950,BOOK XXI.,"Xanthus, and glutted all his sounding course20"
16951,BOOK XXI.,"He, chief of heroes, leaving on the bank"
16952,BOOK XXI.,"His spear against a tamarisk reclined,"
16953,BOOK XXI.,"Plunged like a God, with falchion arm’d alone"
16954,BOOK XXI.,But fill’d with thoughts of havoc. On all sides
16955,BOOK XXI.,Down came his edge; groans follow’d dread to hear25
16956,BOOK XXI.,"Of warriors smitten by the sword, and all"
16957,BOOK XXI.,The waters as they ran redden’d with blood.
16958,BOOK XXI.,"As smaller fishes, flying the pursuit"
16959,BOOK XXI.,"Of some huge dolphin, terrified, the creeks"
16960,BOOK XXI.,"And secret hollows of a haven fill,30"
16961,BOOK XXI.,"For none of all that he can seize he spares,"
16962,BOOK XXI.,So lurk’d the trembling Trojans in the caves
16963,BOOK XXI.,Of Xanthus’ awful flood. But he (his hands
16964,BOOK XXI.,Wearied at length with slaughter) from the rest
16965,BOOK XXI.,"Twelve youths selected whom to death he doom’d,35"
16966,BOOK XXI.,In vengeance for his loved Patroclus slain.
16967,BOOK XXI.,Them stupified with dread like fawns he drove
16968,BOOK XXI.,"Forth from the river, manacling their hands"
16969,BOOK XXI.,"Behind them fast with their own tunic-strings,"
16970,BOOK XXI.,And gave them to his warrior train in charge.40
16971,BOOK XXI.,"Then, ardent still for blood, rushing again"
16972,BOOK XXI.,"Toward the stream, Dardanian Priam’s son"
16973,BOOK XXI.,"He met, Lycaon, as he climb’d the bank."
16974,BOOK XXI.,"Him erst by night, in his own father’s field"
16975,BOOK XXI.,"Finding him, he had led captive away.45"
16976,BOOK XXI.,Lycaon was employ’d cutting green shoots
16977,BOOK XXI.,"Of the wild-fig for chariot-rings, when lo!"
16978,BOOK XXI.,"Terrible, unforeseen, Achilles came."
16979,BOOK XXI.,He seized and sent him in a ship afar
16980,BOOK XXI.,To Lemnos; there the son of Jason paid50
16981,BOOK XXI.,"His price, and, at great cost, Eëtion"
16982,BOOK XXI.,"The guest of Jason, thence redeeming him,"
16983,BOOK XXI.,Sent him to fair Arisba;[3] but he ’scaped
16984,BOOK XXI.,Thence also and regain’d his father’s house.
16985,BOOK XXI.,"Eleven days, at his return, he gave55"
16986,BOOK XXI.,"To recreation joyous with his friends,"
16987,BOOK XXI.,And on the twelfth his fate cast him again
16988,BOOK XXI.,"Into Achilles’ hands, who to the shades"
16989,BOOK XXI.,"Now doom’d him, howsoever loth to go."
16990,BOOK XXI.,Soon as Achilles swiftest of the swift60
16991,BOOK XXI.,Him naked saw (for neither spear had he
16992,BOOK XXI.,"Nor shield nor helmet, but, when he emerged,"
16993,BOOK XXI.,Weary and faint had cast them all away)
16994,BOOK XXI.,Indignant to his mighty self he said.
16995,BOOK XXI.,Gods! I behold a miracle! Ere long65
16996,BOOK XXI.,The valiant Trojans whom my self have slain
16997,BOOK XXI.,"Shall rise from Erebus, for he is here,"
16998,BOOK XXI.,The self-same warrior whom I lately sold
16999,BOOK XXI.,"At Lemnos, free, and in the field again."
17000,BOOK XXI.,The hoary deep is prison strong enough70
17001,BOOK XXI.,"For most, but not for him. Now shall he taste"
17002,BOOK XXI.,"The point of this my spear, that I may learn"
17003,BOOK XXI.,"By sure experience, whether hell itself"
17004,BOOK XXI.,"That holds the strongest fast, can him detain,"
17005,BOOK XXI.,Or whether he shall thence also escape.75
17006,BOOK XXI.,"While musing thus he stood, stunn’d with dismay"
17007,BOOK XXI.,"The youth approach’d, eager to clasp his knees,"
17008,BOOK XXI.,For vehement he felt the dread of death
17009,BOOK XXI.,Working within him; with his Pelian ash
17010,BOOK XXI.,Uplifted high noble Achilles stood80
17011,BOOK XXI.,Ardent to smite him; he with body bent
17012,BOOK XXI.,"Ran under it, and to his knees adhered;"
17013,BOOK XXI.,"The weapon, missing him, implanted stood"
17014,BOOK XXI.,"Close at his back, when, seizing with one hand"
17015,BOOK XXI.,"Achilles’ knees, he with the other grasp’d85"
17016,BOOK XXI.,"The dreadful beam, resolute through despair,"
17017,BOOK XXI.,And in wing’d accents suppliant thus began.
17018,BOOK XXI.,Oh spare me! pity me! Behold I clasp
17019,BOOK XXI.,"Thy knees, Achilles! Ah, illustrious Chief!"
17020,BOOK XXI.,Reject not with disdain a suppliant’s prayer.90
17021,BOOK XXI.,"I am thy guest also, who at thy own board"
17022,BOOK XXI.,"Have eaten bread, and did partake the gift"
17023,BOOK XXI.,Of Ceres with thee on the very day
17024,BOOK XXI.,When thou didst send me in yon field surprised
17025,BOOK XXI.,"For sale to sacred Lemnos, far remote,95"
17026,BOOK XXI.,And for my price receiv’dst a hundred beeves.
17027,BOOK XXI.,"Loose me, and I will yield thee now that sum"
17028,BOOK XXI.,Thrice told. Alas! this morn is but the twelfth
17029,BOOK XXI.,"Since, after numerous hardships, I arrived"
17030,BOOK XXI.,"Once more in Troy, and now my ruthless lot100"
17031,BOOK XXI.,Hath given me into thy hands again.
17032,BOOK XXI.,"Jove cannot less than hate me, who hath twice"
17033,BOOK XXI.,"Made me thy prisoner, and my doom was death,"
17034,BOOK XXI.,"Death in my prime, the day when I was born"
17035,BOOK XXI.,"Son of Laothöe from Alta sprung,105"
17036,BOOK XXI.,"From Alta, whom the Leleges obey"

17038,BOOK XXI.,His daughter to his other numerous wives
17039,BOOK XXI.,"King Priam added, and two sons she bore"
17040,BOOK XXI.,Only to be deprived by thee of both.110
17041,BOOK XXI.,"My brother hath already died, in front"
17042,BOOK XXI.,"Of Ilium’s infantry, by thy bright spear,"
17043,BOOK XXI.,The godlike Polydorus; and like doom
17044,BOOK XXI.,"Shall now be mine, for I despair to escape"
17045,BOOK XXI.,"Thine hands, to which the Gods yield me again.115"
17046,BOOK XXI.,But hear and mark me well. My birth was not
17047,BOOK XXI.,"From the same womb as Hector’s, who hath slain"
17048,BOOK XXI.,Thy valiant friend for clemency renown’d.
17049,BOOK XXI.,Such supplication the illustrious son
17050,BOOK XXI.,"Of Priam made, but answer harsh received.120"
17051,BOOK XXI.,Fool! speak’st of ransom? Name it not to me.
17052,BOOK XXI.,For till my friend his miserable fate
17053,BOOK XXI.,"Accomplish’d, I was somewhat given to spare,"
17054,BOOK XXI.,"And numerous, whom I seized alive, I sold."
17055,BOOK XXI.,"But now, of all the Trojans whom the Gods125"
17056,BOOK XXI.,"Deliver to me, none shall death escape,"

17060,BOOK XXI.,Died not Patroclus. braver far than thou?130
17061,BOOK XXI.,And look on me—see’st not to what a height
17062,BOOK XXI.,"My stature towers, and what a bulk I boast?"
17063,BOOK XXI.,"A King begat me, and a Goddess bore."
17064,BOOK XXI.,What then! A death by violence awaits
17065,BOOK XXI.,"Me also, and at morn, or eve, or noon,135"
17066,BOOK XXI.,"I perish, whensoe’er the destined spear"
17067,BOOK XXI.,"Shall reach me, or the arrow from the nerve."
17068,BOOK XXI.,"He ceased, and where the suppliant kneel’d, he died."
17069,BOOK XXI.,"Quitting the spear, with both hands spread abroad"
17070,BOOK XXI.,"He sat, but swift Achilles with his sword140"
17071,BOOK XXI.,"’Twixt neck and key-bone smote him, and his blade"
17072,BOOK XXI.,Of double edge sank all into the wound.
17073,BOOK XXI.,He prone extended on the champain lay
17074,BOOK XXI.,"Bedewing with his sable blood the glebe,"
17075,BOOK XXI.,"Till, by the foot, Achilles cast him far145"
17076,BOOK XXI.,"Into the stream, and, as he floated down,"
17077,BOOK XXI.,"Thus in wing’d accents, glorying, exclaim’d."
17078,BOOK XXI.,"Lie there, and feed the fishes, which shall lick"
17079,BOOK XXI.,Thy blood secure. Thy mother ne’er shall place
17080,BOOK XXI.,"Thee on thy bier, nor on thy body weep,150"
17081,BOOK XXI.,But swift Scamander on his giddy tide
17082,BOOK XXI.,Shall bear thee to the bosom of the sea.
17083,BOOK XXI.,"There, many a fish shall through the crystal flood"
17084,BOOK XXI.,"Ascending to the rippled surface, find"
17085,BOOK XXI.,Lycaon’s pamper’d flesh delicious fare.155
17086,BOOK XXI.,"Die Trojans! till we reach your city, you"
17087,BOOK XXI.,"Fleeing, and slaughtering, I. This pleasant stream"
17088,BOOK XXI.,Of dimpling silver which ye worship oft
17089,BOOK XXI.,"With victim bulls, and sate with living steeds[4]"
17090,BOOK XXI.,"His rapid whirlpools, shall avail you nought,160"

17107,BOOK XXI.,"Xanthus embolden’d, at the deaths incensed"
17108,BOOK XXI.,"Of many a youth, whom, mercy none vouchsafed,"
17109,BOOK XXI.,Achilles had in all his current slain.
17110,BOOK XXI.,"And now small distance interposed, they faced180"
17111,BOOK XXI.,"Each other, when Achilles thus began."
17112,BOOK XXI.,"Who art and whence, who dar’st encounter me?"
17113,BOOK XXI.,Hapless the sires whose sons my force defy.
17114,BOOK XXI.,To whom the noble son of Pelegon.

17116,BOOK XXI.,My derivation? From the land I come
17117,BOOK XXI.,"Of mellow-soil’d Pœonia far remote,"
17118,BOOK XXI.,Chief leader of Pœnia’s host spear-arm’d;
17119,BOOK XXI.,This day hath also the eleventh risen
17120,BOOK XXI.,"Since I at Troy arrived. For my descent,190"
17121,BOOK XXI.,"It is from Axius river wide-diffused,"
17122,BOOK XXI.,"From Axius, fairest stream that waters earth,"
17123,BOOK XXI.,Sire of bold Pelegon whom men report
17124,BOOK XXI.,"My sire. Let this suffice. Now fight, Achilles!"
17125,BOOK XXI.,"So spake he threatening, and Achilles raised195"
17126,BOOK XXI.,Dauntless the Pelian ash. At once two spears
17127,BOOK XXI.,"The hero bold, Asteropæus threw,"
17128,BOOK XXI.,With both hands apt for battle. One his shield
17129,BOOK XXI.,"Struck but pierced not, impeded by the gold,"
17130,BOOK XXI.,Gift of a God; the other as it flew200
17131,BOOK XXI.,Grazed at his right elbow; sprang the sable blood;
17132,BOOK XXI.,"But, overflying him, the spear in earth"
17133,BOOK XXI.,"Stood planted deep, still hungering for the prey."
17134,BOOK XXI.,"Then, full at the Pœonian Peleus’ son"
17135,BOOK XXI.,Hurl’d forth his weapon with unsparing force205
17136,BOOK XXI.,"But vain; he struck the sloping river bank,"
17137,BOOK XXI.,And mid-length deep stood plunged the ashen beam.
17138,BOOK XXI.,"Then, with his falchion drawn, Achilles flew"
17139,BOOK XXI.,"To smite him; he in vain, meantime, essay’d"
17140,BOOK XXI.,To pluck the rooted spear forth from the bank;210
17141,BOOK XXI.,"Thrice with full force he shook the beam, and thrice,"
17142,BOOK XXI.,"Although reluctant, left it; at his fourth"
17143,BOOK XXI.,"Last effort, bending it he sought to break"
17144,BOOK XXI.,"The ashen spear-beam of Æacides,"
17145,BOOK XXI.,But perish’d by his keen-edged falchion first;215
17146,BOOK XXI.,For on the belly at his navel’s side
17147,BOOK XXI.,He smote him; to the ground effused fell all
17148,BOOK XXI.,"His bowels, death’s dim shadows veil’d his eyes."
17149,BOOK XXI.,Achilles ardent on his bosom fix’d
17150,BOOK XXI.,"His foot, despoil’d him, and exulting cried.220"
17151,BOOK XXI.,"Lie there; though River-sprung, thou find’st it hard"
17152,BOOK XXI.,To cope with sons of Jove omnipotent.
17153,BOOK XXI.,"Thou said’st, a mighty River is my sire—"

17155,BOOK XXI.,"My father, whom the Myrmidons obey,225"

17157,BOOK XXI.,"As Jove all streams excels that seek the sea,"

17159,BOOK XXI.,Behold a River at thy side—let him
17160,BOOK XXI.,"Afford thee, if he can, some succor—No—230"
17161,BOOK XXI.,He may not fight against Saturnian Jove.
17162,BOOK XXI.,"Therefore, not kingly Acheloïus,"
17163,BOOK XXI.,"Nor yet the strength of Ocean’s vast profound,"
17164,BOOK XXI.,"Although from him all rivers and all seas,"
17165,BOOK XXI.,"All fountains and all wells proceed, may boast235"
17166,BOOK XXI.,"Comparison with Jove, but even he"
17167,BOOK XXI.,"Astonish’d trembles at his fiery bolt,"
17168,BOOK XXI.,And his dread thunders rattling in the sky.
17169,BOOK XXI.,"He said, and drawing from the bank his spear[5]"
17170,BOOK XXI.,"Asteropæus left stretch’d on the sands,240"
17171,BOOK XXI.,"Where, while the clear wave dash’d him, eels his flanks"
17172,BOOK XXI.,And ravening fishes numerous nibbled bare.
17173,BOOK XXI.,"The horsed Pœonians next he fierce assail’d,"
17174,BOOK XXI.,Who seeing their brave Chief slain by the sword
17175,BOOK XXI.,"And forceful arm of Peleus’ son, beside245"
17176,BOOK XXI.,The eddy-whirling stream fled all dispersed.
17177,BOOK XXI.,"Thersilochus and Mydon then he slew,"
17178,BOOK XXI.,"Thrasius, Astypylus and Ophelestes,"
17179,BOOK XXI.,Ænius and Mnesus; nor had these sufficed
17180,BOOK XXI.,"Achilles, but Pœonians more had fallen,250"
17181,BOOK XXI.,Had not the angry River from within
17182,BOOK XXI.,"His circling gulfs in semblance, of a man"
17183,BOOK XXI.,"Call’d to him, interrupting thus his rage."
17184,BOOK XXI.,Oh both in courage and injurious deeds
17185,BOOK XXI.,"Unmatch’d, Achilles! whom themselves the Gods255"
17186,BOOK XXI.,"Cease not to aid, if Saturn’s son have doom’d"
17187,BOOK XXI.,"All Ilium’s race to perish by thine arm,"
17188,BOOK XXI.,"Expel them, first, from me, ere thou achieve"
17189,BOOK XXI.,"That dread exploit; for, cumber’d as I am"
17190,BOOK XXI.,"With bodies, I can pour my pleasant stream260"
17191,BOOK XXI.,No longer down into the sacred deep;
17192,BOOK XXI.,All vanish where thou comest. But oh desist
17193,BOOK XXI.,Dread Chief! Amazement fills me at thy deeds.
17194,BOOK XXI.,"To whom Achilles, matchless in the race."
17195,BOOK XXI.,River divine! hereafter be it so.265
17196,BOOK XXI.,But not from slaughter of this faithless host
17197,BOOK XXI.,"I cease, till I shall shut them fast in Troy"
17198,BOOK XXI.,"And trial make of Hector, if his arm"
17199,BOOK XXI.,"In single fight shall strongest prove, or mine"
17200,BOOK XXI.,"He said, and like a God, furious, again270"
17201,BOOK XXI.,Assail’d the Trojans; then the circling flood
17202,BOOK XXI.,To Phœbus thus his loud complaint address’d.
17203,BOOK XXI.,"Ah son of Jove, God of the silver bow!"
17204,BOOK XXI.,The mandate of the son of Saturn ill
17205,BOOK XXI.,"Hast thou perform’d, who, earnest, bade thee aid275"
17206,BOOK XXI.,"The Trojans, till (the sun sunk in the West)"
17207,BOOK XXI.,Night’s shadow dim should veil the fruitful field.
17208,BOOK XXI.,"He ended, and Achilles spear-renown’d"
17209,BOOK XXI.,Plunged from the bank into the middle stream.
17210,BOOK XXI.,"Then, turbulent, the River all his tide280"
17211,BOOK XXI.,"Stirr’d from the bottom, landward heaving off"
17212,BOOK XXI.,The numerous bodies that his current chok’d
17213,BOOK XXI.,"Slain by Achilles; them, as with the roar"
17214,BOOK XXI.,"Of bulls, he cast aground, but deep within"
17215,BOOK XXI.,His oozy gulfs the living safe conceal’d.285
17216,BOOK XXI.,Terrible all around Achilles stood
17217,BOOK XXI.,"The curling wave, then, falling on his shield"
17218,BOOK XXI.,"Dash’d him, nor found his footsteps where to rest."
17219,BOOK XXI.,An elm of massy trunk he seized and branch
17220,BOOK XXI.,"Luxuriant, but it fell torn from the root290"
17221,BOOK XXI.,And drew the whole bank after it; immersed
17222,BOOK XXI.,"It damm’d the current with its ample boughs,"
17223,BOOK XXI.,"And join’d as with a bridge the distant shores,"
17224,BOOK XXI.,Upsprang Achilles from the gulf and turn’d
17225,BOOK XXI.,"His feet, now wing’d for flight, into the plain295"
17226,BOOK XXI.,"Astonish’d; but the God, not so appeased,"
17227,BOOK XXI.,"Arose against him with a darker curl,[6]"
17228,BOOK XXI.,That he might quell him and deliver Troy.
17229,BOOK XXI.,"Back flew Achilles with a bound, the length"
17230,BOOK XXI.,"Of a spear’s cast, for such a spring he own’d300"
17231,BOOK XXI.,As bears the black-plumed eagle on her prey
17232,BOOK XXI.,Strongest and swiftest of the fowls of air.
17233,BOOK XXI.,"Like her he sprang, and dreadful on his chest"
17234,BOOK XXI.,"Clang’d his bright armor. Then, with course oblique"
17235,BOOK XXI.,"He fled his fierce pursuer, but the flood,305"
17236,BOOK XXI.,"Fly where he might, came thundering in his rear."
17237,BOOK XXI.,As when the peasant with his spade a rill
17238,BOOK XXI.,Conducts from some pure fountain through his grove
17239,BOOK XXI.,"Or garden, clearing the obstructed course,"
17240,BOOK XXI.,"The pebbles, as it runs, all ring beneath,310"
17241,BOOK XXI.,"And, as the slope still deepens, swifter still"
17242,BOOK XXI.,"It runs, and, murmuring, outstrips the guide,"
17243,BOOK XXI.,"So him, though swift, the river always reach’d"
17244,BOOK XXI.,Still swifter; who can cope with power divine?
17245,BOOK XXI.,"Oft as the noble Chief, turning, essay’d315"
17246,BOOK XXI.,"Resistance, and to learn if all the Gods"
17247,BOOK XXI.,"Alike rush’d after him, so oft the flood,"
17248,BOOK XXI.,"Jove’s offspring, laved his shoulders. Upward then"
17249,BOOK XXI.,"He sprang distress’d, but with a sidelong sweep"
17250,BOOK XXI.,"Assailing him, and from beneath his steps320"
17251,BOOK XXI.,"Wasting the soil, the Stream his force subdued."
17252,BOOK XXI.,"Then looking to the skies, aloud he mourn’d."
17253,BOOK XXI.,Eternal Sire! forsaken by the Gods
17254,BOOK XXI.,"I sink, none deigns to save me from the flood,"
17255,BOOK XXI.,"From which once saved, I would no death decline.325"
17256,BOOK XXI.,Yet blame I none of all the Powers of heaven
17257,BOOK XXI.,"As Thetis; she with falsehood sooth’d my soul,"
17258,BOOK XXI.,She promised me a death by Phœbus’ shafts
17259,BOOK XXI.,"Swift-wing’d, beneath the battlements of Troy."
17260,BOOK XXI.,"I would that Hector, noblest of his race,330"
17261,BOOK XXI.,"Had slain me, I had then bravely expired"
17262,BOOK XXI.,And a brave man had stripp’d me of my arms.
17263,BOOK XXI.,But fate now dooms me to a death abhorr’d
17264,BOOK XXI.,"Whelm’d in deep waters, like a swine-herd’s boy"
17265,BOOK XXI.,Drown’d in wet weather while he fords a brook.335
17266,BOOK XXI.,"So spake Achilles; then, in human form,"
17267,BOOK XXI.,Minerva stood and Neptune at his side;
17268,BOOK XXI.,"Each seized his hand confirming him, and thus"
17269,BOOK XXI.,The mighty Shaker of the shores began.
17270,BOOK XXI.,"Achilles! moderate thy dismay, fear nought.340"
17271,BOOK XXI.,"In us behold, in Pallas and in me,"
17272,BOOK XXI.,"Effectual aids, and with consent of Jove;"
17273,BOOK XXI.,For to be vanquish’d by a River’s force
17274,BOOK XXI.,Is not thy doom. This foe shall soon be quell’d;
17275,BOOK XXI.,Thine eyes shall see it. Let our counsel rule345
17276,BOOK XXI.,"Thy deed, and all is well. Cease not from war"
17277,BOOK XXI.,Till fast within proud Ilium’s walls her host
17278,BOOK XXI.,"Again be prison’d, all who shall escape;"
17279,BOOK XXI.,Then (Hector slain) to the Achaian fleet
17280,BOOK XXI.,Return; we make the glorious victory thine.350
17281,BOOK XXI.,"So they, and both departing sought the skies."
17282,BOOK XXI.,"Then, animated by the voice divine,"
17283,BOOK XXI.,He moved toward the plain now all o’erspread
17284,BOOK XXI.,By the vast flood on which the bodies swam
17285,BOOK XXI.,And shields of many a youth in battle slain.355
17286,BOOK XXI.,"He leap’d, he waded, and the current stemm’d"
17287,BOOK XXI.,"Right onward, by the flood in vain opposed,"
17288,BOOK XXI.,With such might Pallas fill’d him. Nor his rage
17289,BOOK XXI.,"Scamander aught repress’d, but still the more"
17290,BOOK XXI.,"Incensed against Achilles, curl’d aloft360"
17291,BOOK XXI.,"His waters, and on Simoïs call’d aloud."
17292,BOOK XXI.,Brother! oh let us with united force
17293,BOOK XXI.,"Check, if we may, this warrior; he shall else"
17294,BOOK XXI.,"Soon lay the lofty towers of Priam low,"
17295,BOOK XXI.,"Whose host appall’d, defend them now no more.365"
17296,BOOK XXI.,Haste—succor me—thy channel fill with streams
17297,BOOK XXI.,From all thy fountains; call thy torrents down;
17298,BOOK XXI.,Lift high the waters; mingle trees and stones
17299,BOOK XXI.,"With uproar wild, that we may quell the force"
17300,BOOK XXI.,"Of this dread Chief triumphant now, and fill’d370"
17301,BOOK XXI.,With projects that might more beseem a God.
17302,BOOK XXI.,"But vain shall be his strength, his beauty nought"
17303,BOOK XXI.,"Shall profit him or his resplendent arms,"
17304,BOOK XXI.,"For I will bury them in slime and ooze,"
17305,BOOK XXI.,"And I will overwhelm himself with soil,375"
17306,BOOK XXI.,Sands heaping o’er him and around him sands
17307,BOOK XXI.,"Infinite, that no Greek shall find his bones"
17308,BOOK XXI.,"For ever, in my bottom deep immersed."
17309,BOOK XXI.,"There shall his tomb be piled, nor other earth,"
17310,BOOK XXI.,"At his last rites, his friends shall need for him.380"
17311,BOOK XXI.,"He said, and lifting high his angry tide"
17312,BOOK XXI.,"Vortiginous, against Achilles hurl’d,"
17313,BOOK XXI.,"Roaring, the foam, the bodies, and the blood;"
17314,BOOK XXI.,Then all his sable waves divine again
17315,BOOK XXI.,"Accumulating, bore him swift along.385"
17316,BOOK XXI.,"Shriek’d Juno at that sight, terrified lest"
17317,BOOK XXI.,Achilles in the whirling deluge sunk
17318,BOOK XXI.,"Should perish, and to Vulcan quick exclaim’d."
17319,BOOK XXI.,"Vulcan, my son, arise; for we account"
17320,BOOK XXI.,Xanthus well able to contend with thee.390
17321,BOOK XXI.,Give instant succor; show forth all thy fires.
17322,BOOK XXI.,Myself will haste to call the rapid South
17323,BOOK XXI.,"And Zephyrus, that tempests from the sea"
17324,BOOK XXI.,"Blowing, thou may’st both arms and dead consume"
17325,BOOK XXI.,With hideous conflagration. Burn along395
17326,BOOK XXI.,"The banks of Xanthus, fire his trees and him"
17327,BOOK XXI.,Seize also. Let him by no specious guile
17328,BOOK XXI.,"Of flattery soothe thee, or by threats appall,"
17329,BOOK XXI.,Nor slack thy furious fires till with a shout
17330,BOOK XXI.,"I give command, then bid them cease to blaze.400"
17331,BOOK XXI.,"She spake, and Vulcan at her word his fires"
17332,BOOK XXI.,"Shot dreadful forth; first, kindling on the field,"
17333,BOOK XXI.,He burn’d the bodies strew’d numerous around
17334,BOOK XXI.,Slain by Achilles; arid grew the earth
17335,BOOK XXI.,And the flood ceased. As when a sprightly breeze405
17336,BOOK XXI.,"Autumnal blowing from the North, at once"
17337,BOOK XXI.,"Dries the new-water’d garden,[7] gladdening him"
17338,BOOK XXI.,"Who tills the soil, so was the champain dried;"
17339,BOOK XXI.,"The dead consumed, against the River, next,"
17340,BOOK XXI.,He turn’d the fierceness of his glittering fires.410
17341,BOOK XXI.,"Willows and tamarisks and elms he burn’d,"
17342,BOOK XXI.,"Burn’d lotus, rushes, reeds; all plants and herbs"
17343,BOOK XXI.,That clothed profuse the margin of his flood.
17344,BOOK XXI.,"His eels and fishes, whether wont to dwell"
17345,BOOK XXI.,"In gulfs beneath, or tumble in the stream,415"
17346,BOOK XXI.,All languish’d while the artist of the skies
17347,BOOK XXI.,"Breath’d on them; even Xanthus lost, himself,"
17348,BOOK XXI.,"All force, and, suppliant, Vulcan thus address’d."
17349,BOOK XXI.,Oh Vulcan! none in heaven itself may cope
17350,BOOK XXI.,With thee. I yield to thy consuming fires.420
17351,BOOK XXI.,"Cease, cease. I reck not if Achilles drive"
17352,BOOK XXI.,"Her citizens, this moment, forth from Troy,"
17353,BOOK XXI.,For what are war and war’s concerns to me?
17354,BOOK XXI.,"So spake he scorch’d, and all his waters boil’d."
17355,BOOK XXI.,As some huge caldron hisses urged by force425
17356,BOOK XXI.,"Of circling fires and fill’d with melted lard,"
17357,BOOK XXI.,The unctuous fluid overbubbling[8] streams
17358,BOOK XXI.,"On all sides, while the dry wood flames beneath,"
17359,BOOK XXI.,So Xanthus bubbled and his pleasant flood
17360,BOOK XXI.,"Hiss’d in the fire, nor could he longer flow430"
17361,BOOK XXI.,"But check’d his current, with hot steams annoy’d"
17362,BOOK XXI.,"By Vulcan raised. His supplication, then,"
17363,BOOK XXI.,Importunate to Juno thus he turn’d.
17364,BOOK XXI.,"Ah Juno! why assails thy son my streams,"
17365,BOOK XXI.,Hostile to me alone? Of all who aid435
17366,BOOK XXI.,"The Trojans I am surely least to blame,"
17367,BOOK XXI.,Yet even I desist if thou command;
17368,BOOK XXI.,And let thy son cease also; for I swear
17369,BOOK XXI.,That never will I from the Trojans turn
17370,BOOK XXI.,"Their evil day, not even when the host440"
17371,BOOK XXI.,Of Greece shall set all Ilium in a blaze.
17372,BOOK XXI.,"He said, and by his oath pacified, thus"
17373,BOOK XXI.,The white-arm’d Deity to Vulcan spake.
17374,BOOK XXI.,"Peace, glorious son! we may not in behalf"
17375,BOOK XXI.,Of mortal man thus longer vex a God.445
17376,BOOK XXI.,"Then Vulcan his tremendous fires repress’d,"
17377,BOOK XXI.,And down into his gulfy channel rush’d
17378,BOOK XXI.,The refluent flood; for when the force was once
17379,BOOK XXI.,"Subdued of Xanthus, Juno interposed,"
17380,BOOK XXI.,"Although incensed, herself to quell the strife.450"
17381,BOOK XXI.,But contest vehement the other Gods
17382,BOOK XXI.,"Now waged, each breathing discord; loud they rush’d"
17383,BOOK XXI.,"And fierce to battle, while the boundless earth"
17384,BOOK XXI.,"Quaked under them, and, all around, the heavens"
17385,BOOK XXI.,Sang them together with a trumpet’s voice.455
17386,BOOK XXI.,"Jove listening, on the Olympian summit sat"
17387,BOOK XXI.,"Well-pleased, and, in his heart laughing for joy,"
17388,BOOK XXI.,Beheld the Powers of heaven in battle join’d.
17389,BOOK XXI.,"Not long aloof they stood. Shield-piercer Mars,"
17390,BOOK XXI.,"His brazen spear grasp’d, and began the fight460"
17391,BOOK XXI.,"Rushing on Pallas, whom he thus reproach’d."
17392,BOOK XXI.,"Wasp! front of impudence, and past all bounds"
17393,BOOK XXI.,Audacious! Why impellest thou the Gods
17394,BOOK XXI.,To fight? Thy own proud spirit is the cause.
17395,BOOK XXI.,"Remember’st not, how, urged by thee, the son465"
17396,BOOK XXI.,"Of Tydeus, Diomede, myself assail’d,"
17397,BOOK XXI.,"When thou, the radiant spear with thy own hand"
17398,BOOK XXI.,"Guiding, didst rend my body? Now, I ween,"
17399,BOOK XXI.,The hour is come in which I shall exact
17400,BOOK XXI.,Vengeance for all thy malice shown to me.470
17401,BOOK XXI.,"So saying, her shield he smote tassell’d around"
17402,BOOK XXI.,"Terrific, proof against the bolts of Jove;"
17403,BOOK XXI.,That shield gore-tainted Mars with fury smote.
17404,BOOK XXI.,"But she, retiring, with strong grasp upheaved"
17405,BOOK XXI.,"A rugged stone, black, ponderous, from the plain,475"
17406,BOOK XXI.,"A land-mark fixt by men of ancient times,"
17407,BOOK XXI.,Which hurling at the neck of stormy Mars
17408,BOOK XXI.,"She smote him. Down he fell. Seven acres, stretch’d,"
17409,BOOK XXI.,"He overspread, his ringlets in the dust"
17410,BOOK XXI.,"Polluted lay, and dreadful rang his arms.480"
17411,BOOK XXI.,"The Goddess laugh’d, and thus in accents wing’d"
17412,BOOK XXI.,"With exultation, as he lay, exclaim’d."
17413,BOOK XXI.,Fool! Art thou still to learn how far my force
17414,BOOK XXI.,"Surpasses thine, and darest thou cope with me?"
17415,BOOK XXI.,Now feel the furies of thy mother’s ire485
17416,BOOK XXI.,"Who hates thee for thy treachery to the Greeks,"
17417,BOOK XXI.,And for thy succor given to faithless Troy.
17418,BOOK XXI.,"She said, and turn’d from Mars her glorious eyes."
17419,BOOK XXI.,But him deep-groaning and his torpid powers
17420,BOOK XXI.,"Recovering slow, Venus conducted thence490"
17421,BOOK XXI.,"Daughter of Jove, whom soon as Juno mark’d,"
17422,BOOK XXI.,In accents wing’d to Pallas thus she spake.
17423,BOOK XXI.,Daughter invincible of glorious Jove!
17424,BOOK XXI.,Haste—follow her—Ah shameless! how she leads
17425,BOOK XXI.,Gore-tainted Mars through all the host of heaven.495
17426,BOOK XXI.,
17427,BOOK XXI.,"So she, whom Pallas with delight obey’d;"
17428,BOOK XXI.,"To Venus swift she flew, and on the breast"
17429,BOOK XXI.,With such force smote her that of sense bereft
17430,BOOK XXI.,The fainting Goddess fell. There Venus lay
17431,BOOK XXI.,"And Mars extended on the fruitful glebe,500"
17432,BOOK XXI.,And Pallas thus in accents wing’d exclaim’d.
17433,BOOK XXI.,I would that all who on the part of Troy
17434,BOOK XXI.,"Oppose in fight Achaia’s valiant sons,"
17435,BOOK XXI.,Were firm and bold as Venus in defence
17436,BOOK XXI.,"Of Mars, for whom she dared my power defy!505"
17437,BOOK XXI.,So had dissension (Ilium overthrown
17438,BOOK XXI.,And desolated) ceased long since in heaven.
17439,BOOK XXI.,"So Pallas, and approving Juno smiled."
17440,BOOK XXI.,Then the imperial Shaker of the shores
17441,BOOK XXI.,Thus to Apollo. Phœbus! wherefore stand510
17442,BOOK XXI.,"_We_ thus aloof? Since others have begun,"
17443,BOOK XXI.,Begin we also; shame it were to both
17444,BOOK XXI.,"Should we, no combat waged, ascend again"
17445,BOOK XXI.,Olympus and the brass-built hall of Jove.
17446,BOOK XXI.,"Begin, for thou art younger; me, whose years515"
17447,BOOK XXI.,"Alike and knowledge thine surpass so far,"
17448,BOOK XXI.,It suits not. Oh stupidity! how gross
17449,BOOK XXI.,Art thou and senseless! Are no traces left
17450,BOOK XXI.,In thy remembrance of our numerous wrongs
17451,BOOK XXI.,"Sustain’d at Ilium, when, of all the Gods520"
17452,BOOK XXI.,"Ourselves alone, by Jove’s commandment, served"
17453,BOOK XXI.,"For stipulated hire, a year complete,"
17454,BOOK XXI.,Our task-master the proud Laomedon?
17455,BOOK XXI.,"Myself a bulwark’d town, spacious, secure"
17456,BOOK XXI.,"Against assault, and beautiful as strong525"
17457,BOOK XXI.,"Built for the Trojans, and thine office was"
17458,BOOK XXI.,To feed for King Laomedon his herds
17459,BOOK XXI.,Among the groves of Ida many-valed.
17460,BOOK XXI.,But when the gladsome hours the season brought
17461,BOOK XXI.,"Of payment, then the unjust King of Troy530"
17462,BOOK XXI.,Dismiss’d us of our whole reward amerced
17463,BOOK XXI.,"By violence, and added threats beside."
17464,BOOK XXI.,"Thee into distant isles, bound hand and foot,"
17465,BOOK XXI.,"To sell he threatened, and to amputate"
17466,BOOK XXI.,"The ears of both; we, therefore, hasted thence535"
17467,BOOK XXI.,Resenting deep our promised hire withheld.
17468,BOOK XXI.,Aid’st thou for this the Trojans? Canst thou less
17469,BOOK XXI.,"Than seek, with us, to exterminate the whole"
17470,BOOK XXI.,"Perfidious race, wives, children, husbands, all?"
17471,BOOK XXI.,To whom the King of radiant shafts Apollo.540
17472,BOOK XXI.,"Me, Neptune, thou wouldst deem, thyself, unwise"
17473,BOOK XXI.,Contending for the sake of mortal men
17474,BOOK XXI.,"With thee; a wretched race, who like the leaves"
17475,BOOK XXI.,"Now flourish rank, by fruits of earth sustain’d,"
17476,BOOK XXI.,"Now sapless fall. Here, therefore, us between545"
17477,BOOK XXI.,"Let all strife cease, far better left to them."
17478,BOOK XXI.,"He said, and turn’d away, fearing to lift"
17479,BOOK XXI.,His hand against the brother of his sire.
17480,BOOK XXI.,But him Diana of the woods with sharp
17481,BOOK XXI.,"Rebuke, his huntress sister, thus reproved.550"
17482,BOOK XXI.,"Fly’st thou, Apollo! and to Neptune yield’st"
17483,BOOK XXI.,"An unearn’d victory, the prize of fame"
17484,BOOK XXI.,Resigning patient and with no dispute?
17485,BOOK XXI.,Fool! wherefore bearest thou the bow in vain?
17486,BOOK XXI.,"Ah, let me never in my father’s courts555"
17487,BOOK XXI.,Hear thee among the immortals vaunting more
17488,BOOK XXI.,That thou wouldst Neptune’s self confront in arms.
17489,BOOK XXI.,"So she, to whom Apollo nought replied.[9]"
17490,BOOK XXI.,"But thus the consort of the Thunderer, fired"
17491,BOOK XXI.,"With wrath, reproved the Archeress of heaven.560"
17492,BOOK XXI.,"How hast thou dared, impudent, to oppose"
17493,BOOK XXI.,"My will? Bow-practised as thou art, the task"
17494,BOOK XXI.,To match my force were difficult to thee.
17495,BOOK XXI.,"Is it, because by ordinance of Jove"
17496,BOOK XXI.,"Thou art a lioness to womankind,565"
17497,BOOK XXI.,Killing them at thy pleasure? Ah beware—
17498,BOOK XXI.,"Far easier is it, on the mountain-heights"
17499,BOOK XXI.,"To slay wild beasts and chase the roving hind,"
17500,BOOK XXI.,Than to conflict with mightier than ourselves.
17501,BOOK XXI.,"But, if thou wish a lesson on that theme,570"
17502,BOOK XXI.,Approach—thou shalt be taught with good effect
17503,BOOK XXI.,How far my force in combat passes thine.
17504,BOOK XXI.,"She said, and with her left hand seizing both"
17505,BOOK XXI.,"Diana’s wrists, snatch’d suddenly the bow"
17506,BOOK XXI.,"Suspended on her shoulder with the right,575"
17507,BOOK XXI.,"And, smiling, smote her with it on the ears."
17508,BOOK XXI.,"She, writhing oft and struggling, to the ground"
17509,BOOK XXI.,"Shook forth her rapid shafts, then, weeping, fled"
17510,BOOK XXI.,As to her cavern in some hollow rock
17511,BOOK XXI.,"The dove, not destined to his talons, flies580"
17512,BOOK XXI.,"The hawk’s pursuit, and left her arms behind."
17513,BOOK XXI.,"Then, messenger of heaven, the Argicide"
17514,BOOK XXI.,"Address’d Latona. Combat none with thee,"
17515,BOOK XXI.,"Latona, will I wage. Unsafe it were"
17516,BOOK XXI.,To cope in battle with a spouse of Jove.585
17517,BOOK XXI.,"Go, therefore, loudly as thou wilt, proclaim"
17518,BOOK XXI.,To all the Gods that thou hast vanquish’d me.
17519,BOOK XXI.,"Collecting, then, the bow and arrows fallen"
17520,BOOK XXI.,"In wild disorder on the dusty plain,"
17521,BOOK XXI.,Latona with the sacred charge withdrew590
17522,BOOK XXI.,"Following her daughter; she, in the abode"
17523,BOOK XXI.,"Brass-built arriving of Olympian Jove,"
17524,BOOK XXI.,"Sat on his knees, weeping till all her robe"
17525,BOOK XXI.,"Ambrosial shook. The mighty Father smiled,"
17526,BOOK XXI.,"And to his bosom straining her, inquired.595"
17527,BOOK XXI.,"Daughter beloved! who, which of all the Gods"
17528,BOOK XXI.,"Hath raised his hand, presumptuous, against thee,"
17529,BOOK XXI.,As if convicted of some open wrong?
17530,BOOK XXI.,To whom the clear-voiced Huntress crescent-crown’d.
17531,BOOK XXI.,"My Father! Juno, thy own consort fair600"
17532,BOOK XXI.,"My sorrow caused, from whom dispute and strife"
17533,BOOK XXI.,"Perpetual, threaten the immortal Powers."
17534,BOOK XXI.,Thus they in heaven mutual conferr’d. Meantime
17535,BOOK XXI.,Apollo into sacred Troy return’d
17536,BOOK XXI.,"Mindful to guard her bulwarks, lest the Greeks605"
17537,BOOK XXI.,Too soon for Fate should desolate the town.
17538,BOOK XXI.,"The other Gods, some angry, some elate"
17539,BOOK XXI.,"With victory, the Olympian heights regain’d,"
17540,BOOK XXI.,And sat beside the Thunderer. But the son
17541,BOOK XXI.,Of Peleus—He both Trojans slew and steeds.610
17542,BOOK XXI.,As when in volumes slow smoke climbs the skies
17543,BOOK XXI.,From some great city which the Gods have fired
17544,BOOK XXI.,"Vindictive, sorrow thence to many ensues"
17545,BOOK XXI.,"With mischief, and to all labor severe,"
17546,BOOK XXI.,"So caused Achilles labor on that day,615"
17547,BOOK XXI.,"Severe, and mischief to the men of Troy."
17548,BOOK XXI.,But ancient Priam from a sacred tower
17549,BOOK XXI.,"Stood looking forth, whence soon he noticed vast"
17550,BOOK XXI.,"Achilles, before whom the Trojans fled"
17551,BOOK XXI.,All courage lost. Descending from the tower620
17552,BOOK XXI.,With mournful cries and hasting to the wall
17553,BOOK XXI.,He thus enjoin’d the keepers of the gates.
17554,BOOK XXI.,Hold wide the portals till the flying host
17555,BOOK XXI.,"Re-enter, for himself is nigh, himself"
17556,BOOK XXI.,"Achilles drives them home. Now, wo to Troy!625"
17557,BOOK XXI.,But soon as safe within the walls received
17558,BOOK XXI.,"They breathe again, shut fast the ponderous gates"
17559,BOOK XXI.,"At once, lest that destroyer also pass."
17560,BOOK XXI.,"He said; they, shooting back the bars, threw wide"
17561,BOOK XXI.,"The gates and saved the people, whom to aid630"
17562,BOOK XXI.,"Apollo also sprang into the field,"
17563,BOOK XXI.,"They, parch’d with drought and whiten’d all with dust,"
17564,BOOK XXI.,"Flew right toward the town, while, spear in hand,"
17565,BOOK XXI.,"Achilles press’d them, vengeance in his heart"
17566,BOOK XXI.,"And all on fire for glory. Then, full sure,635"
17567,BOOK XXI.,"Ilium, the city of lofty gates, had fallen"
17568,BOOK XXI.,"Won by the Grecians, had not Phœbus roused"
17569,BOOK XXI.,"Antenor’s valiant son, the noble Chief"
17570,BOOK XXI.,"Agenor; him with dauntless might he fill’d,"
17571,BOOK XXI.,And shielding him against the stroke of fate640
17572,BOOK XXI.,"Beside him stood himself, by the broad beech"
17573,BOOK XXI.,"Cover’d and wrapt in clouds. Agenor then,"
17574,BOOK XXI.,Seeing the city-waster hero nigh
17575,BOOK XXI.,"Achilles, stood, but standing, felt his mind"
17576,BOOK XXI.,"Troubled with doubts; he groan’d, and thus he mused.645"
17577,BOOK XXI.,[10]Alas! if following the tumultuous flight
17578,BOOK XXI.,"Of these, I shun Achilles, swifter far"
17579,BOOK XXI.,He soon will lop my ignominious head.
17580,BOOK XXI.,"But if, these leaving to be thus dispersed"
17581,BOOK XXI.,"Before him, from the city-wall I fly650"
17582,BOOK XXI.,Across the plain of Troy into the groves
17583,BOOK XXI.,"Of Ida, and in Ida’s thickets lurk,"
17584,BOOK XXI.,"I may, at evening, to the town return"
17585,BOOK XXI.,Bathed and refresh’d. But whither tend my thoughts?
17586,BOOK XXI.,Should he my flight into the plain observe655
17587,BOOK XXI.,"And swift pursuing seize me, then, farewell"
17588,BOOK XXI.,"All hope to scape a miserable death,"
17589,BOOK XXI.,For he hath strength passing the strength of man.
17590,BOOK XXI.,How then—shall I withstand him here before
17591,BOOK XXI.,The city? He hath also flesh to steel660
17592,BOOK XXI.,"Pervious, within it but a single life,"
17593,BOOK XXI.,"And men report him mortal, howsoe’er"
17594,BOOK XXI.,Saturnian Jove lift him to glory now.
17595,BOOK XXI.,"So saying, he turn’d and stood, his dauntless heart"
17596,BOOK XXI.,Beating for battle. As the pard springs forth665
17597,BOOK XXI.,"To meet the hunter from her gloomy lair,"
17598,BOOK XXI.,"Nor, hearing loud the hounds, fears or retires,"
17599,BOOK XXI.,But whether from afar or nigh at hand
17600,BOOK XXI.,"He pierce her first, although transfixt, the fight"
17601,BOOK XXI.,"Still tries, and combats desperate till she fall,670"
17602,BOOK XXI.,"So, brave Antenor’s son fled not, or shrank,"
17603,BOOK XXI.,"Till he had proved Achilles, but his breast"
17604,BOOK XXI.,O’ershadowing with his buckler and his spear
17605,BOOK XXI.,"Aiming well-poised against him, loud exclaim’d."
17606,BOOK XXI.,Renown’d Achilles! Thou art high in hope675
17607,BOOK XXI.,"Doubtless, that thou shalt this day overthrow"
17608,BOOK XXI.,The city of the glorious sons of Troy.
17609,BOOK XXI.,"Fool! ye must labor yet ere she be won,"
17610,BOOK XXI.,"For numerous are her citizens and bold,"
17611,BOOK XXI.,And we will guard her for our parents’ sake680
17612,BOOK XXI.,Our wives and little ones. But here thou diest
17613,BOOK XXI.,Terrible Chief and dauntless as thou art.
17614,BOOK XXI.,"He said, and with full force hurling his lance"
17615,BOOK XXI.,"Smote, and err’d not, his greave beneath his knee"
17616,BOOK XXI.,"The glittering tin, forged newly, at the stroke685"
17617,BOOK XXI.,"Tremendous rang, but quick recoil’d and vain"
17618,BOOK XXI.,"The weapon, weak against that guard divine."
17619,BOOK XXI.,Then sprang Achilles in his turn to assail
17620,BOOK XXI.,"Godlike Agenor, but Apollo took"
17621,BOOK XXI.,"That glory from him, snatching wrapt in clouds690"
17622,BOOK XXI.,"Agenor thence, whom calm he sent away."
17623,BOOK XXI.,Then Phœbus from pursuit of Ilium’s host
17624,BOOK XXI.,By art averted Peleus’ son; the form
17625,BOOK XXI.,"Assuming of Agenor, swift he fled"
17626,BOOK XXI.,"Before him, and Achilles swift pursued.695"
17627,BOOK XXI.,While him Apollo thus lured to the chase
17628,BOOK XXI.,"Wide o’er the fruitful plain, inclining still"
17629,BOOK XXI.,Toward Scamander’s dizzy stream his course
17630,BOOK XXI.,"Nor flying far before, but with false hope"
17631,BOOK XXI.,"Always beguiling him, the scatter’d host700"
17632,BOOK XXI.,"Meantime, in joyful throngs, regain’d the town."
17633,BOOK XXI.,"They fill’d and shut it fast, nor dared to wait"
17634,BOOK XXI.,"Each other in the field, or to inquire"
17635,BOOK XXI.,"Who lived and who had fallen, but all, whom flight"
17636,BOOK XXI.,"Had rescued, like a flood pour’d into Troy.705"
17637,BOOK XXI.,
17638,BOOK XXI.,
17639,BOOK XXI.,"The Trojans being now within the city, excepting Hector, the field is"
17640,BOOK XXI.,cleared for the most important and decisive action in the poem; that
17641,BOOK XXI.,"is, the battle between Achilles and Hector, and the death of the"
17642,BOOK XXI.,latter. This part of the story is managed with singular skill. It seems
17643,BOOK XXI.,"as if the poet, feeling the importance of the catastrophe, wished to"
17644,BOOK XXI.,"withdraw from view the personages of less consequence, and to"
17645,BOOK XXI.,concentrate our attention upon those two alone. The poetic action and
17646,BOOK XXI.,"description are narrowed in extent, but deepened in interest. The fate"
17647,BOOK XXI.,of Troy is impending; the irreversible decree of Jupiter is about to be
17648,BOOK XXI.,"executed; the heroes, whose bravery is to be the instrument of bringing"
17649,BOOK XXI.,"about this consummation, are left together on the plain.—Felton."

17670,BOOK XXII.,"And Hector, by his adverse fate ensnared,"
17671,BOOK XXII.,Still stood exposed before the Scæan gate.
17672,BOOK XXII.,Then spake Apollo thus to Peleus’ son.
17673,BOOK XXII.,"Wherefore, thyself mortal, pursuest thou me"
17674,BOOK XXII.,"Immortal? oh Achilles! blind with rage,10"

17679,BOOK XXII.,Yet hope me not to slay; I cannot die.15
17680,BOOK XXII.,"To whom Achilles swiftest of the swift,"
17681,BOOK XXII.,"Indignant. Oh, of all the Powers above"
17682,BOOK XXII.,"To me most adverse, Archer of the skies!"
17683,BOOK XXII.,"Thou hast beguiled me, leading me away"
17684,BOOK XXII.,"From Ilium far, whence intercepted, else,20"
17685,BOOK XXII.,No few had at this moment gnaw’d the glebe.
17686,BOOK XXII.,"Thou hast defrauded me of great renown,"
17687,BOOK XXII.,"And, safe thyself, hast rescued _them_ with ease."
17688,BOOK XXII.,"Ah—had I power, I would requite thee well."
17689,BOOK XXII.,"So saying, incensed he turned toward the town25"
17690,BOOK XXII.,"His rapid course, like some victorious steed"
17691,BOOK XXII.,"That whirls, at stretch, a chariot to the goal."
17692,BOOK XXII.,"Such seem’d Achilles, coursing light the field."
17693,BOOK XXII.,"Him, first, the ancient King of Troy perceived"
17694,BOOK XXII.,"Scouring the plain, resplendent as the star30"
17695,BOOK XXII.,"Autumnal, of all stars in dead of night"

17697,BOOK XXII.,"Brightest it shines, but ominous, and dire"
17698,BOOK XXII.,Disease portends to miserable man;[1]
17699,BOOK XXII.,So beam’d Achilles’ armor as he flew.35
17700,BOOK XXII.,Loud wail’d the hoary King; with lifted hands
17701,BOOK XXII.,"His head he smote, and, uttering doleful cries"
17702,BOOK XXII.,"Of supplication, sued to his own son."
17703,BOOK XXII.,"He, fixt before the gate, desirous stood"
17704,BOOK XXII.,"Of combat with Achilles, when his sire40"
17705,BOOK XXII.,"With arms outstretch’d toward him, thus began."
17706,BOOK XXII.,"My Hector! wait not, oh my son! the approach"
17707,BOOK XXII.,"Of this dread Chief, alone, lest premature"
17708,BOOK XXII.,"Thou die, this moment by Achilles slain,"

17710,BOOK XXII.,"Him loved as I! then, soon should vultures rend"
17711,BOOK XXII.,"And dogs his carcase, and my grief should cease."
17712,BOOK XXII.,"He hath unchilded me of many a son,"

17719,BOOK XXII.,I will redeem them with gold and brass55

17728,BOOK XXII.,"Of life cut off, enhance Achilles’ fame."
17729,BOOK XXII.,Commiserate also thy unhappy sire65
17730,BOOK XXII.,"Ere yet distracted, whom Saturnian Jove"
17731,BOOK XXII.,"Ordains to a sad death, and ere I die"
17732,BOOK XXII.,To woes innumerable; to behold
17733,BOOK XXII.,"Sons slaughter’d, daughters ravish’d, torn and stripp’d"
17734,BOOK XXII.,"The matrimonial chamber, infants dash’d70"
17735,BOOK XXII.,"Against the ground in dire hostility,[2]"

17749,BOOK XXII.,"Receive dishonor, of all ills that wait85"
17750,BOOK XXII.,"On miserable man, that sure is worst."
17751,BOOK XXII.,"So spake the ancient King, and his grey hairs"
17752,BOOK XXII.,"Pluck’d with both hands, but Hector firm endured."
17753,BOOK XXII.,"On the other side all tears his mother stood,"
17754,BOOK XXII.,"And lamentation; with one hand she bared,90"
17755,BOOK XXII.,"And with the other hand produced her breast,"
17756,BOOK XXII.,"Then in wing’d accents, weeping, him bespake."
17757,BOOK XXII.,"My Hector! reverence this, and pity me"
17758,BOOK XXII.,"If ever, drawing forth this breast, thy griefs"
17759,BOOK XXII.,"Of infancy I soothed, oh now, my son!95"
17760,BOOK XXII.,"Acknowledge it, and from within the walls"
17761,BOOK XXII.,Repulse this enemy; stand not abroad

17765,BOOK XXII.,"Thy body, but, where we can never come,"
17766,BOOK XXII.,Dogs shall devour it in the fleet of Greece.
17767,BOOK XXII.,"So they with prayers importuned, and with tears"
17768,BOOK XXII.,"Their son, but him sway’d not; unmoved he stood,"
17769,BOOK XXII.,Expecting vast Achilles now at hand.105
17770,BOOK XXII.,As some fell serpent in his cave expects
17771,BOOK XXII.,"The traveller’s approach, batten’d with herbs"
17772,BOOK XXII.,"Of baneful juice to fury,[3] forth he looks"
17773,BOOK XXII.,"Hideous, and lies coil’d all around his den,"
17774,BOOK XXII.,"So Hector, fill’d with confidence untamed,110"
17775,BOOK XXII.,"Fled not, but placing his bright shield against"
17776,BOOK XXII.,"A buttress, with his noble heart conferr’d."
17777,BOOK XXII.,"[4]Alas for me! should I repass the gate,"
17778,BOOK XXII.,Polydamas would be the first to heap
17779,BOOK XXII.,"Reproaches on me, for he bade me lead115"
17780,BOOK XXII.,The Trojans back this last calamitous night
17781,BOOK XXII.,In which Achilles rose to arms again.
17782,BOOK XXII.,"But I refused, although to have complied,"
17783,BOOK XXII.,Had proved more profitable far; since then
17784,BOOK XXII.,By rash resolves of mine I have destroy’d120
17785,BOOK XXII.,"The people, how can I escape the blame"
17786,BOOK XXII.,Of all in Troy? The meanest there will say—
17787,BOOK XXII.,By his self-will he hath destroy’d us all.
17788,BOOK XXII.,"So shall they speak, and then shall I regret"
17789,BOOK XXII.,That I return’d ere I had slain in fight125
17790,BOOK XXII.,"Achilles, or that, by Achilles slain,"
17791,BOOK XXII.,I died not nobly in defence of Troy.
17792,BOOK XXII.,"But shall I thus? Lay down my bossy shield,"
17793,BOOK XXII.,"Put off my helmet, and my spear recline"
17794,BOOK XXII.,"Against the city wall, then go myself130"
17795,BOOK XXII.,"To meet the brave Achilles, and at once"
17796,BOOK XXII.,"Promise him Helen, for whose sake we strive"
17797,BOOK XXII.,With all the wealth that Paris in his fleet
17798,BOOK XXII.,"Brought home, to be restored to Atreus’ sons,"
17799,BOOK XXII.,And to distribute to the Greeks at large135
17800,BOOK XXII.,"All hidden treasures of the town, an oath"
17801,BOOK XXII.,"Taking beside from every senator,"
17802,BOOK XXII.,"That he will nought conceal, but will produce"
17803,BOOK XXII.,And share in just equality what stores
17804,BOOK XXII.,Soever our fair city still includes?140
17805,BOOK XXII.,"Ah airy speculations, questions vain!"
17806,BOOK XXII.,I may not sue to him: compassion none
17807,BOOK XXII.,"Will he vouchsafe me, or my suit respect."
17808,BOOK XXII.,"But, seeing me unarm’d, will sate at once"
17809,BOOK XXII.,"His rage, and womanlike I shall be slain.145"
17810,BOOK XXII.,It is no time from oak or hollow rock
17811,BOOK XXII.,"With him to parley, as a nymph and swain,"
17812,BOOK XXII.,"A nymph and swain[5] soft parley mutual hold,"
17813,BOOK XXII.,But rather to engage in combat fierce
17814,BOOK XXII.,Incontinent; so shall we soonest learn150
17815,BOOK XXII.,"Whom Jove will make victorious, him or me."
17816,BOOK XXII.,Thus pondering he stood; meantime approach’d
17817,BOOK XXII.,"Achilles, terrible as fiery Mars,"
17818,BOOK XXII.,"Crest-tossing God, and brandish’d as he came"
17819,BOOK XXII.,O’er his right shoulder high the Pelian spear.155
17820,BOOK XXII.,"Like lightning, or like flame, or like the sun"
17821,BOOK XXII.,"Ascending, beam’d his armor. At that sight"
17822,BOOK XXII.,"Trembled the Trojan Chief, nor dared expect"
17823,BOOK XXII.,"His nearer step, but flying left the gates"
17824,BOOK XXII.,"Far distant, and Achilles swift pursued.160"
17825,BOOK XXII.,"As in the mountains, fleetest fowl of air,"
17826,BOOK XXII.,The hawk darts eager at the dove; she scuds
17827,BOOK XXII.,"Aslant, he screaming, springs and springs again"
17828,BOOK XXII.,"To seize her, all impatient for the prey,"
17829,BOOK XXII.,So flew Achilles constant to the track165
17830,BOOK XXII.,"Of Hector, who with dreadful haste beneath"
17831,BOOK XXII.,The Trojan bulwarks plied his agile limbs.
17832,BOOK XXII.,Passing the prospect-mount where high in air
17833,BOOK XXII.,"The wild-fig waved,[6] they rush’d along the road,"
17834,BOOK XXII.,Declining never from the wall of Troy.170
17835,BOOK XXII.,"And now they reach’d the running rivulets clear,"
17836,BOOK XXII.,Where from Scamander’s dizzy flood arise
17837,BOOK XXII.,"Two fountains,[7] tepid one, from which a smoke"
17838,BOOK XXII.,"Issues voluminous as from a fire,"
17839,BOOK XXII.,"The other, even in summer heats, like hail175"
17840,BOOK XXII.,"For cold, or snow, or crystal-stream frost-bound."
17841,BOOK XXII.,Beside them may be seen the broad canals
17842,BOOK XXII.,"Of marble scoop’d, in which the wives of Troy"
17843,BOOK XXII.,And all her daughters fair were wont to lave
17844,BOOK XXII.,"Their costly raiment,[8] while the land had rest,180"
17845,BOOK XXII.,And ere the warlike sons of Greece arrived.
17846,BOOK XXII.,"By these they ran, one fleeing, one in chase."
17847,BOOK XXII.,"Valiant was he who fled, but valiant far"
17848,BOOK XXII.,Beyond him he who urged the swift pursuit;
17849,BOOK XXII.,"Nor ran they for a vulgar prize, a beast185"
17850,BOOK XXII.,"For sacrifice, or for the hide of such,"
17851,BOOK XXII.,"The swift foot-racer’s customary meed,"
17852,BOOK XXII.,But for the noble Hector’s life they ran.
17853,BOOK XXII.,"As when two steeds, oft conquerors, trim the goal"
17854,BOOK XXII.,"For some illustrious prize, a tripod bright190"
17855,BOOK XXII.,"Or beauteous virgin, at a funeral game,"
17856,BOOK XXII.,So they with nimble feet the city thrice
17857,BOOK XXII.,"Of Priam compass’d. All the Gods look’d on,"
17858,BOOK XXII.,And thus the Sire of Gods and men began.
17859,BOOK XXII.,Ah—I behold a warrior dear to me195
17860,BOOK XXII.,"Around the walls of Ilium driven, and grieve"
17861,BOOK XXII.,"For Hector, who the thighs of fatted bulls"
17862,BOOK XXII.,On yonder heights of Ida many-valed
17863,BOOK XXII.,"Burn’d oft to me, and in the heights of Troy:[9]"
17864,BOOK XXII.,"But him Achilles, glorious Chief, around200"
17865,BOOK XXII.,The city walls of Priam now pursues.
17866,BOOK XXII.,"Consider this, ye Gods! weigh the event."
17867,BOOK XXII.,"Shall we from death save Hector? or, at length,"
17868,BOOK XXII.,"Leave him, although in battle high renown’d,"
17869,BOOK XXII.,To perish by the might of Peleus’ son?205
17870,BOOK XXII.,Whom answer’d thus Pallas cerulean-eyed.
17871,BOOK XXII.,Dread Sovereign of the storms! what hast thou said?
17872,BOOK XXII.,Wouldst thou deliver from the stroke of fate
17873,BOOK XXII.,A mortal man death-destined from of old?
17874,BOOK XXII.,Do it; but small thy praise shall be in heaven.210
17875,BOOK XXII.,"Then answer thus, cloud-gatherer Jove return’d."
17876,BOOK XXII.,"Fear not, Tritonia, daughter dear! that word"
17877,BOOK XXII.,Spake not my purpose; me thou shalt perceive
17878,BOOK XXII.,Always to thee indulgent. What thou wilt
17879,BOOK XXII.,"That execute, and use thou no delay.215"
17880,BOOK XXII.,"So roused he Pallas of herself prepared,"
17881,BOOK XXII.,And from the heights Olympian down she flew.
17882,BOOK XXII.,With unremitting speed Achilles still
17883,BOOK XXII.,Urged Hector. As among the mountain-height
17884,BOOK XXII.,"The hound pursues, roused newly from her lair220"
17885,BOOK XXII.,The flying fawn through many a vale and grove;
17886,BOOK XXII.,"And though she trembling skulk the shrubs beneath,"
17887,BOOK XXII.,"Tracks her continual, till he find the prey,"
17888,BOOK XXII.,So ’scaped not Hector Peleus’ rapid son.
17889,BOOK XXII.,Oft as toward the Dardan gates he sprang225
17890,BOOK XXII.,"Direct, and to the bulwarks firm of Troy,"
17891,BOOK XXII.,"Hoping some aid by volleys from the wall,"
17892,BOOK XXII.,"So oft, outstripping him, Achilles thence"
17893,BOOK XXII.,"Enforced him to the field, who, as he might,"
17894,BOOK XXII.,Still ever stretch’d toward the walls again.230
17895,BOOK XXII.,"As, in a dream,[10] pursuit hesitates oft,"
17896,BOOK XXII.,"This hath no power to fly, that to pursue,"
17897,BOOK XXII.,"So these—one fled, and one pursued in vain."
17898,BOOK XXII.,"How, then, had Hector his impending fate"
17899,BOOK XXII.,"Eluded, had not Phœbus, at his last,235"
17900,BOOK XXII.,"Last effort meeting him, his strength restored,"
17901,BOOK XXII.,And wing’d for flight his agile limbs anew?
17902,BOOK XXII.,"The son of Peleus, as he ran, his brows"
17903,BOOK XXII.,"Shaking, forbad the people to dismiss"
17904,BOOK XXII.,"A dart at Hector, lest a meaner hand240"
17905,BOOK XXII.,"Piercing him, should usurp the foremost praise."
17906,BOOK XXII.,But when the fourth time to those rivulets.
17907,BOOK XXII.,"They came, then lifting high his golden scales,"
17908,BOOK XXII.,Two lots the everlasting Father placed
17909,BOOK XXII.,"Within them, for Achilles one, and one245"
17910,BOOK XXII.,"For Hector, balancing the doom of both."
17911,BOOK XXII.,"Grasping it in the midst, he raised the beam."
17912,BOOK XXII.,"Down went the fatal day of Hector, down"
17913,BOOK XXII.,"To Ades, and Apollo left his side."
17914,BOOK XXII.,Then blue-eyed Pallas hasting to the son250
17915,BOOK XXII.,"Of Peleus, in wing’d accents him address’d."
17916,BOOK XXII.,"Now, dear to Jove, Achilles famed in arms!"
17917,BOOK XXII.,"I hope that, fierce in combat though he be,"
17918,BOOK XXII.,"We shall, at last, slay Hector, and return"
17919,BOOK XXII.,Crown’d with great glory to the fleet of Greece.255
17920,BOOK XXII.,"No fear of his deliverance now remains,"
17921,BOOK XXII.,"Not even should the King of radiant shafts,"
17922,BOOK XXII.,"Apollo, toil in supplication, roll’d"
17923,BOOK XXII.,And roll’d again[11] before the Thunderer’s feet.
17924,BOOK XXII.,"But stand, recover breath; myself, the while,260"
17925,BOOK XXII.,Shall urge him to oppose thee face to face.
17926,BOOK XXII.,"So Pallas spake, whom joyful he obey’d,"
17927,BOOK XXII.,"And on his spear brass-pointed lean’d. But she,"
17928,BOOK XXII.,"(Achilles left) to noble Hector pass’d,"
17929,BOOK XXII.,"And in the form, and with the voice loud-toned265"
17930,BOOK XXII.,"Approaching of Deiphobus, his ear"
17931,BOOK XXII.,"In accents, as of pity, thus address’d."
17932,BOOK XXII.,"Ah brother! thou art overtask’d, around"
17933,BOOK XXII.,The walls of Troy by swift Achilles driven;
17934,BOOK XXII.,"But stand, that we may chase him in his turn.[12]270"
17935,BOOK XXII.,To whom crest-tossing Hector huge replied.
17936,BOOK XXII.,Deiphobus! of all my father’s sons
17937,BOOK XXII.,"Brought forth by Hecuba, I ever loved"
17938,BOOK XXII.,"Thee most, but more than ever love thee now,"
17939,BOOK XXII.,"Who hast not fear’d, seeing me, for my sake275"
17940,BOOK XXII.,"To quit the town, where others rest content."
17941,BOOK XXII.,"To whom the Goddess, thus, cerulean-eyed."
17942,BOOK XXII.,Brother! our parents with much earnest suit
17943,BOOK XXII.,"Clasping my knees, and all my friends implored me"
17944,BOOK XXII.,"To stay in Troy, (such fear hath seized on all)280"
17945,BOOK XXII.,But grief for thee prey’d on my inmost soul.
17946,BOOK XXII.,Come—fight we bravely—spare we now our spears
17947,BOOK XXII.,No longer; now for proof if Peleus’ son
17948,BOOK XXII.,"Slaying us both, shall bear into the fleet"
17949,BOOK XXII.,"Our arms gore-stain’d, or perish slain by thee.285"
17950,BOOK XXII.,"So saying, the wily Goddess led the way."
17951,BOOK XXII.,"They soon, approaching each the other, stood"
17952,BOOK XXII.,"Opposite, and huge Hector thus began."
17953,BOOK XXII.,Pelides! I will fly thee now no more.
17954,BOOK XXII.,Thrice I have compass’d Priam’s spacious walls290
17955,BOOK XXII.,"A fugitive, and have not dared abide"
17956,BOOK XXII.,"Thy onset, but my heart now bids me stand"
17957,BOOK XXII.,"Dauntless, and I will slay, or will be slain."
17958,BOOK XXII.,But come. We will attest the Gods; for they
17959,BOOK XXII.,Are fittest both to witness and to guard295
17960,BOOK XXII.,Our covenant. If Jove to me vouchsafe
17961,BOOK XXII.,"The hard-earn’d victory, and to take thy life,"
17962,BOOK XXII.,I will not with dishonor foul insult
17963,BOOK XXII.,"Thy body, but, thine armor stripp’d, will give"
17964,BOOK XXII.,"Thee to thy friends, as thou shalt me to mine.300"
17965,BOOK XXII.,"To whom Achilles, lowering dark, replied."
17966,BOOK XXII.,Hector! my bitterest foe! speak not to me
17967,BOOK XXII.,Of covenants! as concord can be none
17968,BOOK XXII.,"Lions and men between, nor wolves and lambs"
17969,BOOK XXII.,"Can be unanimous, but hate perforce305"
17970,BOOK XXII.,"Each other by a law not to be changed,"
17971,BOOK XXII.,So cannot amity subsist between
17972,BOOK XXII.,Thee and myself; nor league make I with thee
17973,BOOK XXII.,"Or compact, till thy blood in battle shed"
17974,BOOK XXII.,"Or mine, shall gratify the fiery Mars.310"
17975,BOOK XXII.,Rouse all thy virtue; thou hast utmost need
17976,BOOK XXII.,"Of valor now, and of address in arms."
17977,BOOK XXII.,Escape me more thou canst not; Pallas’ hand
17978,BOOK XXII.,By mine subdues thee; now will I avenge
17979,BOOK XXII.,At once the agonies of every Greek315
17980,BOOK XXII.,In thy unsparing fury slain by thee.
17981,BOOK XXII.,"He said, and, brandishing the Pelian ash,"
17982,BOOK XXII.,"Dismiss’d it; but illustrious Hector warn’d,"
17983,BOOK XXII.,"Crouched low, and, overflying him, it pierced"
17984,BOOK XXII.,"The soil beyond, whence Pallas plucking it320"
17985,BOOK XXII.,"Unseen, restored it to Achilles’ hand,"
17986,BOOK XXII.,And Hector to his godlike foe replied.
17987,BOOK XXII.,"Godlike Achilles! thou hast err’d, nor know’st"
17988,BOOK XXII.,"At all my doom from Jove, as thou pretend’st,"
17989,BOOK XXII.,"But seek’st, by subtlety and wind of words,325"
17990,BOOK XXII.,"All empty sounds, to rob me of my might."
17991,BOOK XXII.,Yet stand I firm. Think not to pierce my back.
17992,BOOK XXII.,"Behold my bosom! if the Gods permit,"
17993,BOOK XXII.,"Meet me advancing, and transpierce me there."
17994,BOOK XXII.,"Meantime avoid my glittering spear, but oh330"
17995,BOOK XXII.,May’st thou receive it all! since lighter far
17996,BOOK XXII.,"To Ilium should the toils of battle prove,"
17997,BOOK XXII.,"Wert thou once slain, the fiercest of her foes."
17998,BOOK XXII.,"He said, and hurling his long spear with aim"
17999,BOOK XXII.,"Unerring, smote the centre of the shield335"
18000,BOOK XXII.,"Of Peleus’ son, but his spear glanced away."
18001,BOOK XXII.,"He, angry to have sent it forth in vain,"
18002,BOOK XXII.,(For he had other none) with eyes downcast
18003,BOOK XXII.,"Stood motionless awhile, then with loud voice"
18004,BOOK XXII.,"Sought from Deiphobus, white-shielded Chief,340"
18005,BOOK XXII.,A second; but Deiphobus was gone.
18006,BOOK XXII.,"Then Hector understood his doom, and said."
18007,BOOK XXII.,"Ah, it is plain; this is mine hour to die."
18008,BOOK XXII.,"I thought Deiphobus at hand, but me"
18009,BOOK XXII.,"Pallas beguiled, and he is still in Troy.345"
18010,BOOK XXII.,"A bitter death threatens me, it is nigh,"
18011,BOOK XXII.,"And there is no escape; Jove, and Jove’s son"
18012,BOOK XXII.,"Apollo, from the first, although awhile"
18013,BOOK XXII.,"My prompt deliverers, chose this lot for me,"
18014,BOOK XXII.,And now it finds me. But I will not fall350
18015,BOOK XXII.,Inglorious; I will act some great exploit
18016,BOOK XXII.,That shall be celebrated ages hence.
18017,BOOK XXII.,"So saying, his keen falchion from his side"
18018,BOOK XXII.,"He drew, well-temper’d, ponderous, and rush’d"
18019,BOOK XXII.,At once to combat. As the eagle darts355
18020,BOOK XXII.,Right downward through a sullen cloud to seize
18021,BOOK XXII.,"Weak lamb or timorous hare, so brandishing"
18022,BOOK XXII.,"His splendid falchion, Hector rush’d to fight."
18023,BOOK XXII.,"Achilles, opposite, with fellest ire"
18024,BOOK XXII.,Full-fraught came on; his shield with various art360
18025,BOOK XXII.,"Celestial form’d, o’erspread his ample chest,"
18026,BOOK XXII.,And on his radiant casque terrific waved
18027,BOOK XXII.,"The bushy gold of his resplendent crest,"
18028,BOOK XXII.,"By Vulcan spun, and pour’d profuse around."
18029,BOOK XXII.,"Bright as, among the stars, the star of all365"
18030,BOOK XXII.,"Most radiant, Hesperus, at midnight moves,"
18031,BOOK XXII.,"So, in the right hand of Achilles beam’d"
18032,BOOK XXII.,"His brandish’d spear, while, meditating wo"
18033,BOOK XXII.,"To Hector, he explored his noble form,"
18034,BOOK XXII.,Seeking where he was vulnerable most.370
18035,BOOK XXII.,"But every part, his dazzling armor torn"
18036,BOOK XXII.,"From brave Patroclus’ body, well secured,"
18037,BOOK XXII.,Save where the circling key-bone from the neck
18038,BOOK XXII.,"Disjoins the shoulder; there his throat appear’d,"
18039,BOOK XXII.,Whence injured life with swiftest flight escapes;375
18040,BOOK XXII.,"Achilles, plunging in that part his spear,"
18041,BOOK XXII.,Impell’d it through the yielding flesh beyond.
18042,BOOK XXII.,The ashen beam his power of utterance left
18043,BOOK XXII.,"Still unimpair’d, but in the dust he fell,"
18044,BOOK XXII.,And the exulting conqueror exclaim’d.380
18045,BOOK XXII.,"But Hector! thou hadst once far other hopes,"
18046,BOOK XXII.,"And, stripping slain Patroclus, thought’st thee safe,"
18047,BOOK XXII.,Nor caredst for absent me. Fond dream and vain!
18048,BOOK XXII.,I was not distant far; in yonder fleet
18049,BOOK XXII.,"He left one able to avenge his death,385"
18050,BOOK XXII.,And he hath slain thee. Thee the dogs shall rend
18051,BOOK XXII.,"Dishonorably, and the fowls of air,"
18052,BOOK XXII.,But all Achaia’s host shall him entomb.
18053,BOOK XXII.,To whom the Trojan Chief languid replied.
18054,BOOK XXII.,"By thy own life, by theirs who gave thee birth,390"
18055,BOOK XXII.,"And by thy knees,[13] oh let not Grecian dogs"
18056,BOOK XXII.,"Rend and devour me, but in gold accept"
18057,BOOK XXII.,"And brass a ransom at my father’s hands,"
18058,BOOK XXII.,And at my mother’s an illustrious price;
18059,BOOK XXII.,"Send home my body, grant me burial rites395"
18060,BOOK XXII.,Among the daughters and the sons of Troy.
18061,BOOK XXII.,To whom with aspect stern Achilles thus.
18062,BOOK XXII.,Dog! neither knees nor parents name to me.
18063,BOOK XXII.,"I would my fierceness of revenge were such,"
18064,BOOK XXII.,"That I could carve and eat thee, to whose arms400"
18065,BOOK XXII.,"Such griefs I owe; so true it is and sure,"
18066,BOOK XXII.,That none shall save thy carcase from the dogs.
18067,BOOK XXII.,"No, trust me, would thy parents bring me weigh’d"
18068,BOOK XXII.,"Ten—twenty ransoms, and engage on oath"
18069,BOOK XXII.,To add still more; would thy Dardanian Sire405
18070,BOOK XXII.,"Priam, redeem thee with thy weight in gold,"
18071,BOOK XXII.,Not even at that price would I consent
18072,BOOK XXII.,That she who bare should place thee on thy bier
18073,BOOK XXII.,With lamentation; dogs and ravening fowls
18074,BOOK XXII.,Shall rend thy body while a scrap remains.410
18075,BOOK XXII.,"Then, dying, warlike Hector thus replied."
18076,BOOK XXII.,"Full well I knew before, how suit of mine"
18077,BOOK XXII.,Should speed preferr’d to thee. Thy heart is steel.
18078,BOOK XXII.,"But oh, while yet thou livest, think, lest the Gods"
18079,BOOK XXII.,"Requite thee on that day, when pierced thyself415"
18080,BOOK XXII.,"By Paris and Apollo, thou shalt fall,"
18081,BOOK XXII.,"Brave as thou art, before the Scæan gate."
18082,BOOK XXII.,"He ceased, and death involved him dark around."
18083,BOOK XXII.,"His spirit, from his limbs dismiss’d, the house"
18084,BOOK XXII.,"Of Ades sought, mourning in her descent420"
18085,BOOK XXII.,"Youth’s prime and vigor lost, disastrous doom!"
18086,BOOK XXII.,"But him though dead, Achilles thus bespake."
18087,BOOK XXII.,Die thou. My death shall find me at what hour
18088,BOOK XXII.,"Jove gives commandment, and the Gods above."
18089,BOOK XXII.,"He spake, and from the dead drawing away425"
18090,BOOK XXII.,"His brazen spear, placed it apart, then stripp’d"
18091,BOOK XXII.,His arms gore-stain’d. Meantime the other sons
18092,BOOK XXII.,"Of the Achaians, gathering fast around,"
18093,BOOK XXII.,"The bulk admired, and the proportion just"
18094,BOOK XXII.,Of Hector; neither stood a Grecian there430
18095,BOOK XXII.,"Who pierced him not, and thus the soldier spake."
18096,BOOK XXII.,Ye Gods! how far more patient of the touch
18097,BOOK XXII.,"Is Hector now, than when he fired the fleet!"
18098,BOOK XXII.,"Thus would they speak, then give him each a stab."
18099,BOOK XXII.,"And now, the body stripp’d, their noble Chief435"
18100,BOOK XXII.,"The swift Achilles standing in the midst,"
18101,BOOK XXII.,The Grecians in wing’d accents thus address’d.
18102,BOOK XXII.,"Friends, Chiefs and Senators of Argos’ host!"
18103,BOOK XXII.,"Since, by the will of heaven, this man is slain"
18104,BOOK XXII.,"Who harm’d us more than all our foes beside,440"
18105,BOOK XXII.,"Essay we next the city, so to learn"
18106,BOOK XXII.,"The Trojan purpose, whether (Hector slain)"
18107,BOOK XXII.,"They will forsake the citadel, or still"
18108,BOOK XXII.,"Defend it, even though of him deprived."
18109,BOOK XXII.,"But wherefore speak I thus? still undeplored,445"
18110,BOOK XXII.,Unburied in my fleet Patroclus lies;
18111,BOOK XXII.,"Him never, while alive myself, I mix"
18112,BOOK XXII.,"With living men and move, will I forget."
18113,BOOK XXII.,"In Ades, haply, they forget the dead,"
18114,BOOK XXII.,"Yet will not I Patroclus, even there.450"
18115,BOOK XXII.,"Now chanting pæans, ye Achaian youths!"
18116,BOOK XXII.,Return we to the fleet with this our prize;
18117,BOOK XXII.,"We have achieved great glory,[14] we have slain"
18118,BOOK XXII.,"Illustrious Hector, him whom Ilium praised"
18119,BOOK XXII.,"In all her gates, and as a God revered.455"
18120,BOOK XXII.,He said; then purposing dishonor foul
18121,BOOK XXII.,"To noble Hector, both his feet he bored"
18122,BOOK XXII.,"From heel to ancle, and, inserting thongs,"
18123,BOOK XXII.,"Them tied behind his chariot, but his head"
18124,BOOK XXII.,Left unsustain’d to trail along the ground.460
18125,BOOK XXII.,"Ascending next, the armor at his side"
18126,BOOK XXII.,"He placed, then lash’d the steeds; they willing flew"
18127,BOOK XXII.,"Thick dust around the body dragg’d arose,"
18128,BOOK XXII.,"His sable locks all swept the plain, and all"
18129,BOOK XXII.,"His head, so graceful once, now track’d the dust,465"
18130,BOOK XXII.,For Jove had given it into hostile hands
18131,BOOK XXII.,That they might shame it in his native soil.[15]
18132,BOOK XXII.,"Thus, whelm’d in dust, it went. The mother Queen"
18133,BOOK XXII.,"Her son beholding, pluck’d her hair away,"
18134,BOOK XXII.,"Cast far aside her lucid veil, and fill’d470"
18135,BOOK XXII.,"With shrieks the air. His father wept aloud,"
18136,BOOK XXII.,"And, all around, long, long complaints were heard"
18137,BOOK XXII.,"And lamentations in the streets of Troy,"
18138,BOOK XXII.,"Not fewer or less piercing, than if flames"
18139,BOOK XXII.,Had wrapt all Ilium to her topmost towers.475
18140,BOOK XXII.,His people scarce detain’d the ancient King
18141,BOOK XXII.,"Grief-stung, and resolute to issue forth"
18142,BOOK XXII.,Through the Dardanian gates; to all he kneel’d
18143,BOOK XXII.,"In turn, then roll’d himself in dust, and each"
18144,BOOK XXII.,By name solicited to give him way.480
18145,BOOK XXII.,"Stand off, my fellow mourners! I would pass"
18146,BOOK XXII.,"The gates, would seek, alone, the Grecian fleet."
18147,BOOK XXII.,"I go to supplicate the bloody man,"
18148,BOOK XXII.,"Yon ravager; he may respect, perchance,"
18149,BOOK XXII.,"My years, may feel some pity of my age;485"
18150,BOOK XXII.,"For, such as I am, his own father is,"
18151,BOOK XXII.,"Peleus, who rear’d him for a curse to Troy,"
18152,BOOK XXII.,"But chiefly rear’d him to myself a curse,"
18153,BOOK XXII.,So numerous have my sons in prime of youth
18154,BOOK XXII.,"Fall’n by his hand, all whom I less deplore490"
18155,BOOK XXII.,(Though mourning all) than one; my agonies
18156,BOOK XXII.,For Hector soon shall send me to the shades.
18157,BOOK XXII.,"Oh had he but within these arms expired,"
18158,BOOK XXII.,"The hapless Queen who bore him, and myself"
18159,BOOK XXII.,"Had wept him, then, till sorrow could no more!495"
18160,BOOK XXII.,"So spake he weeping, and the citizens"
18161,BOOK XXII.,"All sigh’d around; next, Hecuba began"
18162,BOOK XXII.,"Amid the women, thus, her sad complaint."
18163,BOOK XXII.,"Ah wherefore, oh my son! wretch that I am,"
18164,BOOK XXII.,"Breathe I forlorn of thee? Thou, night and day,500"
18165,BOOK XXII.,"My glory wast in Ilium, thee her sons"
18166,BOOK XXII.,"And daughters, both, hail’d as their guardian God,"
18167,BOOK XXII.,"Conscious of benefits from thee received,"
18168,BOOK XXII.,Whose life prolong’d should have advanced them all
18169,BOOK XXII.,To high renown. Vain boast! thou art no more.505
18170,BOOK XXII.,So mourn’d the Queen. But fair Andromache
18171,BOOK XXII.,"Nought yet had heard, nor knew by sure report"
18172,BOOK XXII.,Hector’s delay without the city gates.
18173,BOOK XXII.,"She in a closet of her palace sat,"
18174,BOOK XXII.,"A twofold web weaving magnificent,510"
18175,BOOK XXII.,"With sprinkled flowers inwrought of various hues,"
18176,BOOK XXII.,And to her maidens had commandment given
18177,BOOK XXII.,"Through all her house, that compassing with fire"
18178,BOOK XXII.,"An ample tripod, they should warm a bath"
18179,BOOK XXII.,For noble Hector from the fight return’d.515
18180,BOOK XXII.,Tenderness ill-inform’d! she little knew
18181,BOOK XXII.,"That in the field, from such refreshments far,"
18182,BOOK XXII.,Pallas had slain him by Achilles’ hand.
18183,BOOK XXII.,She heard a cry of sorrow from the tower;
18184,BOOK XXII.,"Her limbs shook under her, her shuttle fell,520"
18185,BOOK XXII.,"And to her bright-hair’d train, alarm’d, she cried."
18186,BOOK XXII.,"Attend me two of you, that I may learn"
18187,BOOK XXII.,What hath befallen. I have heard the voice
18188,BOOK XXII.,Of the Queen-mother; my rebounding heart
18189,BOOK XXII.,"Chokes me, and I seem fetter’d by a frost.525"
18190,BOOK XXII.,Some mischief sure o’er Priam’s sons impends.
18191,BOOK XXII.,Far be such tidings from me! but I fear
18192,BOOK XXII.,"Horribly, lest Achilles, cutting off"
18193,BOOK XXII.,"My dauntless Hector from the gates alone,"
18194,BOOK XXII.,"Enforce him to the field, and quell perhaps530"
18195,BOOK XXII.,"The might, this moment, of that dreadful arm"
18196,BOOK XXII.,His hinderance long; for Hector ne’er was wont
18197,BOOK XXII.,"To seek his safety in the ranks, but flew"
18198,BOOK XXII.,"First into battle, yielding place to none."
18199,BOOK XXII.,"So saying, she rush’d with palpitating heart535"
18200,BOOK XXII.,"And frantic air abroad, by her two maids"
18201,BOOK XXII.,"Attended; soon arriving at the tower,"
18202,BOOK XXII.,"And at the throng of men, awhile she stood"
18203,BOOK XXII.,"Down-looking wistful from the city-wall,"
18204,BOOK XXII.,"And, seeing him in front of Ilium, dragg’d540"
18205,BOOK XXII.,"So cruelly toward the fleet of Greece,"
18206,BOOK XXII.,O’erwhelm’d with sudden darkness at the view
18207,BOOK XXII.,"Fell backward, with a sigh heard all around."
18208,BOOK XXII.,"Far distant flew dispersed her head-attire,"
18209,BOOK XXII.,"Twist, frontlet, diadem, and even the veil545"
18210,BOOK XXII.,By golden Venus given her on the day
18211,BOOK XXII.,When Hector led her from Eëtion’s house
18212,BOOK XXII.,Enrich’d with nuptial presents to his home.
18213,BOOK XXII.,Around her throng’d her sisters of the house
18214,BOOK XXII.,"Of Priam, numerous, who within their arms550"
18215,BOOK XXII.,"Fast held her[16] loathing life; but she, her breath"
18216,BOOK XXII.,"At length and sense recovering, her complaint"
18217,BOOK XXII.,Broken with sighs amid them thus began.
18218,BOOK XXII.,Hector! I am undone; we both were born
18219,BOOK XXII.,"To misery, thou in Priam’s house in Troy,555"
18220,BOOK XXII.,And I in Hypoplacian Thebes wood-crown’d
18221,BOOK XXII.,"Beneath Eëtion’s roof. He, doom’d himself"
18222,BOOK XXII.,"To sorrow, me more sorrowfully doom’d,"
18223,BOOK XXII.,"Sustain’d in helpless infancy, whom oh"
18224,BOOK XXII.,That he had ne’er begotten! thou descend’st560
18225,BOOK XXII.,"To Pluto’s subterraneous dwelling drear,"
18226,BOOK XXII.,"Leaving myself destitute, and thy boy,"
18227,BOOK XXII.,"Fruit of our hapless loves, an infant yet,"
18228,BOOK XXII.,"Never to be hereafter thy delight,"
18229,BOOK XXII.,Nor love of thine to share or kindness more.565
18230,BOOK XXII.,"For should he safe survive this cruel war,"
18231,BOOK XXII.,With the Achaians penury and toil
18232,BOOK XXII.,"Must be his lot, since strangers will remove"

18318,BOOK XXIII.,Himself a feast funereal for them all.
18319,BOOK XXIII.,Many a white ox under the ruthless steel
18320,BOOK XXIII.,"Lay bleeding, many a sheep and blatant goat,"
18321,BOOK XXIII.,"With many a saginated boar bright-tusk’d,40"
18322,BOOK XXIII.,Amid fierce flames Vulcanian stretch’d to roast.
18323,BOOK XXIII.,Copious the blood ran all around the dead.
18324,BOOK XXIII.,And now the Kings of Greece conducted thence
18325,BOOK XXIII.,To Agamemnon’s tent the royal son
18326,BOOK XXIII.,"Of Peleus, loth to go, and won at last45"
18327,BOOK XXIII.,"With difficulty, such his anger was"
18328,BOOK XXIII.,And deep resentment of his slaughter’d friend.
18329,BOOK XXIII.,"Soon then as Agamemnon’s tent they reach’d,"
18330,BOOK XXIII.,The sovereign bade his heralds kindle fire
18331,BOOK XXIII.,"Around an ample vase, with purpose kind50"
18332,BOOK XXIII.,Moving Achilles from his limbs to cleanse
18333,BOOK XXIII.,The stains of battle; but he firm refused
18334,BOOK XXIII.,"That suit, and bound refusal with an oath—"
18335,BOOK XXIII.,"No; by the highest and the best of all,"
18336,BOOK XXIII.,By Jove I will not. Never may it be55
18337,BOOK XXIII.,"That brazen bath approach this head of mine,"
18338,BOOK XXIII.,Till I shall first Patroclus’ body give
18339,BOOK XXIII.,"To his last fires, till I shall pile his tomb,"
18340,BOOK XXIII.,And sheer my locks in honor of my friend;
18341,BOOK XXIII.,"For, like to this, no second wo shall e’er60"
18342,BOOK XXIII.,"My heart invade, while vital breath I draw."
18343,BOOK XXIII.,"But, all unwelcome as it is, repast"
18344,BOOK XXIII.,"Now calls us. Agamemnon, King of men!"
18345,BOOK XXIII.,Give thou command that at the dawn they bring
18346,BOOK XXIII.,"Wood hither, such large portion as beseems65"
18347,BOOK XXIII.,"The dead, descending to the shades, to share,"
18348,BOOK XXIII.,That hungry flames consuming out of sight
18349,BOOK XXIII.,"His body soon, the host may war again."
18350,BOOK XXIII.,"He spake; they, hearing, readily obey’d."
18351,BOOK XXIII.,"Then, each his food preparing with dispatch,70"
18352,BOOK XXIII.,"They ate, nor wanted any of the guests"
18353,BOOK XXIII.,"Due portion, and their appetites sufficed"
18354,BOOK XXIII.,"To food and wine, all to their tents repair’d"
18355,BOOK XXIII.,Seeking repose; but on the sands beside
18356,BOOK XXIII.,The billowy deep Achilles groaning lay75
18357,BOOK XXIII.,"Amidst his Myrmidons, where space he found"
18358,BOOK XXIII.,With blood unstain’d beside the dashing wave.[1]
18359,BOOK XXIII.,"There, soon as sleep, deliverer of the mind,"
18360,BOOK XXIII.,Wrapp’d him around (for much his noble limbs
18361,BOOK XXIII.,With chase of Hector round the battlements80
18362,BOOK XXIII.,Of wind-swept Ilium wearied were and spent)
18363,BOOK XXIII.,"The soul came to him of his hapless friend,"
18364,BOOK XXIII.,"In bulk resembling, in expressive eyes"
18365,BOOK XXIII.,"And voice Patroclus, and so clad as he."
18366,BOOK XXIII.,"Him, hovering o’er his head, the form address’d.85"
18367,BOOK XXIII.,"Sleep’st thou, Achilles! of thy friend become"
18368,BOOK XXIII.,Heedless? Him living thou didst not neglect
18369,BOOK XXIII.,Whom thou neglectest dead. Give me a tomb
18370,BOOK XXIII.,"Instant, that I may pass the infernal gates."
18371,BOOK XXIII.,"For now, the shades and spirits of the dead90"
18372,BOOK XXIII.,"Drive me afar, denying me my wish"
18373,BOOK XXIII.,"To mingle with them on the farthest shore,"
18374,BOOK XXIII.,And in wide-portal’d Ades sole I roam.
18375,BOOK XXIII.,"Give me thine hand, I pray thee, for the earth"
18376,BOOK XXIII.,"I visit never more, once burnt with fire;95"
18377,BOOK XXIII.,We never shall again close council hold
18378,BOOK XXIII.,"As we were wont, for me my fate severe,"
18379,BOOK XXIII.,"Mine even from my birth, hath deep absorb’d."
18380,BOOK XXIII.,"And oh Achilles, semblance of the Gods!"
18381,BOOK XXIII.,Thou too predestined art beneath the wall100
18382,BOOK XXIII.,To perish of the high-born Trojan race.
18383,BOOK XXIII.,"But hear my last injunction! ah, my friend!"
18384,BOOK XXIII.,"My bones sepulchre not from thine apart,"
18385,BOOK XXIII.,"But as, together we were nourish’d both"
18386,BOOK XXIII.,Beneath thy roof (what time from Opoëis105
18387,BOOK XXIII.,"Menœtius led me to thy father’s house,"
18388,BOOK XXIII.,"Although a child, yet fugitive for blood,"
18389,BOOK XXIII.,"Which, in a quarrel at the dice, I spilt,"
18390,BOOK XXIII.,"Killing my playmate by a casual blow,"
18391,BOOK XXIII.,"The offspring of Amphidamas, when, like110"
18392,BOOK XXIII.,"A father, Peleus with all tenderness"
18393,BOOK XXIII.,"Received and cherish’d me, and call’d me thine)"
18394,BOOK XXIII.,"So, let one vase inclose, at last, our bones,"
18395,BOOK XXIII.,"The golden vase, thy Goddess mother’s gift.[2]"
18396,BOOK XXIII.,"To whom Achilles, matchless in the race.115"
18397,BOOK XXIII.,"Ah, loved and honor’d! wherefore hast thou come!"
18398,BOOK XXIII.,Why thus enjoin’d me? I will all perform
18399,BOOK XXIII.,With diligence that thou hast now desired.
18400,BOOK XXIII.,"But nearer stand, that we may mutual clasp"
18401,BOOK XXIII.,"Each other, though but with a short embrace,120"
18402,BOOK XXIII.,And sad satiety of grief enjoy.
18403,BOOK XXIII.,"He said, and stretch’d his arms toward the shade,"
18404,BOOK XXIII.,But him seized not; shrill-clamoring and light
18405,BOOK XXIII.,"As smoke, the spirit pass’d into the earth."
18406,BOOK XXIII.,"Amazed, upsprang Achilles, clash’d aloud125"
18407,BOOK XXIII.,"His palms together, and thus, sad, exclaim’d."
18408,BOOK XXIII.,"Ah then, ye Gods! there doubtless are below"
18409,BOOK XXIII.,"The soul and semblance both, but empty forms;"
18410,BOOK XXIII.,"For all night long, mourning, disconsolate,"
18411,BOOK XXIII.,"The soul of my Patroclus, hapless friend!130"
18412,BOOK XXIII.,"Hath hover’d o’er me, giving me in charge"
18413,BOOK XXIII.,"His last requests, just image of himself."
18414,BOOK XXIII.,"So saying, he call’d anew their sorrow forth,"
18415,BOOK XXIII.,And rosy-palm’d Aurora found them all
18416,BOOK XXIII.,Mourning afresh the pitiable dead.135
18417,BOOK XXIII.,Then royal Agamemnon call’d abroad
18418,BOOK XXIII.,Mules and mule-drivers from the tents in haste
18419,BOOK XXIII.,"To gather wood. Uprose a valiant man,"
18420,BOOK XXIII.,"Friend of the virtuous Chief Idomeneus,"
18421,BOOK XXIII.,"Meriones, who led them to the task.140"
18422,BOOK XXIII.,"They, bearing each in hand his sharpen’d axe"
18423,BOOK XXIII.,"And twisted cord, thence journey’d forth, the mules"
18424,BOOK XXIII.,Driving before them; much uneven space
18425,BOOK XXIII.,"They measured, hill and dale, right onward now,"
18426,BOOK XXIII.,And now circuitous; but at the groves145
18427,BOOK XXIII.,"Arrived at length, of Ida fountain-fed,"
18428,BOOK XXIII.,Their keen-edged axes to the towering oaks
18429,BOOK XXIII.,Dispatchful they applied; down fell the trees
18430,BOOK XXIII.,"With crash sonorous. Splitting, next, the trunks,"
18431,BOOK XXIII.,"They bound them on the mules; they, with firm hoofs150"
18432,BOOK XXIII.,"The hill-side stamping, through the thickets rush’d"
18433,BOOK XXIII.,Desirous of the plain. Each man his log
18434,BOOK XXIII.,(For so the armor-bearer of the King
18435,BOOK XXIII.,"Of Crete, Meriones, had them enjoin’d)"
18436,BOOK XXIII.,"Bore after them, and each his burthen cast155"
18437,BOOK XXIII.,"Down on the beach regular, where a tomb"
18438,BOOK XXIII.,Of ample size Achilles for his friend
18439,BOOK XXIII.,"Patroclus had, and for himself, design’d."
18440,BOOK XXIII.,"Much fuel thrown together, side by side"
18441,BOOK XXIII.,"There down they sat, and his command at once160"
18442,BOOK XXIII.,"Achilles issued to his warriors bold,"
18443,BOOK XXIII.,"That all should gird their armor, and the steeds"
18444,BOOK XXIII.,Join to their chariots; undelaying each
18445,BOOK XXIII.,"Complied, and in bright arms stood soon array’d."
18446,BOOK XXIII.,Then mounted combatants and charioteers.165
18447,BOOK XXIII.,"First, moved the chariots, next, the infantry"
18448,BOOK XXIII.,"Proceeded numerous, amid whom his friends,"
18449,BOOK XXIII.,"Bearing the body of Patroclus, went."
18450,BOOK XXIII.,"They poll’d their heads, and cover’d him with hair"
18451,BOOK XXIII.,"Shower’d over all his body, while behind170"
18452,BOOK XXIII.,"Noble Achilles march’d, the hero’s head"
18453,BOOK XXIII.,"Sustaining sorrowful, for to the realms"
18454,BOOK XXIII.,Of Ades a distinguish’d friend he sent.
18455,BOOK XXIII.,"And now, arriving on the ground erewhile"
18456,BOOK XXIII.,"Mark’d by Achilles, setting down the dead,175"
18457,BOOK XXIII.,"They heap’d the fuel quick, a lofty pile.[3]"
18458,BOOK XXIII.,"But Peleus’ son, on other thoughts intent,"
18459,BOOK XXIII.,"Retiring from the funeral pile, shore off"
18460,BOOK XXIII.,"His amber ringlets,[4] whose exuberant growth"
18461,BOOK XXIII.,"Sacred to Sperchius he had kept unshorn,180"
18462,BOOK XXIII.,"And looking o’er the gloomy deep, he said."
18463,BOOK XXIII.,Sperchius! in vain Peleus my father vow’d
18464,BOOK XXIII.,"That, hence returning to my native land,"
18465,BOOK XXIII.,These ringlets shorn I should present to thee[5]
18466,BOOK XXIII.,"With a whole hecatomb, and should, beside,185"
18467,BOOK XXIII.,Rams offer fifty at thy fountain head
18468,BOOK XXIII.,"In thy own field, at thy own fragrant shrine."
18469,BOOK XXIII.,"So vow’d the hoary Chief, whose wishes thou"
18470,BOOK XXIII.,"Leavest unperform’d. Since, therefore, never more"
18471,BOOK XXIII.,"I see my native home, the hero these190"
18472,BOOK XXIII.,Patroclus takes down with him to the shades.
18473,BOOK XXIII.,"He said, and filling with his hair the hand"
18474,BOOK XXIII.,"Of his dead friend, the sorrows of his train"
18475,BOOK XXIII.,Waken’d afresh. And now the lamp of day
18476,BOOK XXIII.,"Westering[6] apace, had left them still in tears,195"
18477,BOOK XXIII.,Had not Achilles suddenly address’d
18478,BOOK XXIII.,"King Agamemnon, standing at his side."
18479,BOOK XXIII.,Atrides! (for Achaia’s sons thy word
18480,BOOK XXIII.,Will readiest execute) we may with grief
18481,BOOK XXIII.,"Satiate ourselves hereafter; but, the host200"
18482,BOOK XXIII.,"Dispersing from the pile, now give command"
18483,BOOK XXIII.,"That they prepare repast; ourselves,[7] to whom"
18484,BOOK XXIII.,These labors in peculiar appertain
18485,BOOK XXIII.,Will finish them; but bid the Chiefs abide.
18486,BOOK XXIII.,"Which when imperial Agamemnon heard,205"
18487,BOOK XXIII.,He scatter’d instant to their several ships
18488,BOOK XXIII.,The people; but the burial-dressers thence
18489,BOOK XXIII.,"Went not; they, still abiding, heap’d the pile."
18490,BOOK XXIII.,A hundred feet of breadth from side to side
18491,BOOK XXIII.,"They gave to it, and on the summit placed210"
18492,BOOK XXIII.,With sorrowing hearts the body of the dead.
18493,BOOK XXIII.,"Many a fat sheep, with many an ox full-horn’d"
18494,BOOK XXIII.,"They flay’d before the pile, busy their task"
18495,BOOK XXIII.,"Administering, and Peleus’ son the fat"
18496,BOOK XXIII.,"Taking from every victim, overspread215"
18497,BOOK XXIII.,Complete the body with it of his friend[8]
18498,BOOK XXIII.,"Patroclus, and the flay’d beasts heap’d around."
18499,BOOK XXIII.,"Then, placing flagons on the pile, replete"
18500,BOOK XXIII.,"With oil and honey, he inclined their mouths"
18501,BOOK XXIII.,"Toward the bier, and slew and added next,220"
18502,BOOK XXIII.,"Deep-groaning and in haste, four martial steeds."
18503,BOOK XXIII.,"Nine dogs the hero at his table fed,"
18504,BOOK XXIII.,"Of which beheading two, their carcases"
18505,BOOK XXIII.,"He added also. Last, twelve gallant sons"
18506,BOOK XXIII.,Of noble Trojans slaying (for his heart225
18507,BOOK XXIII.,Teem’d with great vengeance) he applied the force
18508,BOOK XXIII.,"Of hungry flames that should devour the whole,"
18509,BOOK XXIII.,"Then, mourning loud, by name his friend invoked."
18510,BOOK XXIII.,"Rejoice, Patroclus! even in the shades,"
18511,BOOK XXIII.,Behold my promise to thee all fulfill’d!230
18512,BOOK XXIII.,"Twelve gallant sons of Trojans famed in arms,"
18513,BOOK XXIII.,"Together with thyself, are all become"
18514,BOOK XXIII.,Food for these fires: but fire shall never feed
18515,BOOK XXIII.,On Hector; him I destine to the dogs.
18516,BOOK XXIII.,So threaten’d he; but him no dogs devour’d;235
18517,BOOK XXIII.,"Them, day and night, Jove’s daughter Venus chased"
18518,BOOK XXIII.,"Afar, and smooth’d the hero o’er with oils"
18519,BOOK XXIII.,"Of rosy scent ambrosial, lest his corse,"
18520,BOOK XXIII.,Behind Achilles’ chariot dragg’d along
18521,BOOK XXIII.,"So rudely, should be torn; and Phœbus hung240"
18522,BOOK XXIII.,"A veil of sable clouds from heaven to earth,"
18523,BOOK XXIII.,"O’ershadowing broad the space where Hector lay,"
18524,BOOK XXIII.,Lest parching suns intense should stiffen him.
18525,BOOK XXIII.,"But the pile kindled not. Then, Peleus’ son"
18526,BOOK XXIII.,"Seeking a place apart, two Winds in prayer245"
18527,BOOK XXIII.,"Boreas invoked and Zephyrus, to each"
18528,BOOK XXIII.,Vowing large sacrifice. With earnest suit
18529,BOOK XXIII.,(Libation pouring from a golden cup)
18530,BOOK XXIII.,"Their coming he implored, that so the flames"
18531,BOOK XXIII.,"Kindling, incontinent might burn the dead.250"
18532,BOOK XXIII.,"Iris, his supplications hearing, swift"
18533,BOOK XXIII.,"Convey’d them to the Winds; they, in the hall"
18534,BOOK XXIII.,Banqueting of the heavy-blowing West
18535,BOOK XXIII.,"Sat frequent. Iris, sudden at the gate"
18536,BOOK XXIII.,"Appear’d; they, at the sight upstarting all,255"
18537,BOOK XXIII.,Invited each the Goddess to himself.
18538,BOOK XXIII.,But she refused a seat and thus she spake.[9]
18539,BOOK XXIII.,I sit not here. Borne over Ocean’s stream
18540,BOOK XXIII.,"Again, to Æthiopia’s land I go"
18541,BOOK XXIII.,"Where hecatombs are offer’d to the Gods,260"
18542,BOOK XXIII.,"Which, with the rest, I also wish to share."
18543,BOOK XXIII.,"But Peleus’ son, earnest, the aid implores"
18544,BOOK XXIII.,"Of Boreas and of Zephyrus the loud,"
18545,BOOK XXIII.,Vowing large sacrifice if ye will fan
18546,BOOK XXIII.,Briskly the pile on which Patroclus lies265
18547,BOOK XXIII.,By all Achaia’s warriors deep deplored.
18548,BOOK XXIII.,"She said, and went. Then suddenly arose"
18549,BOOK XXIII.,"The Winds, and, roaring, swept the clouds along."
18550,BOOK XXIII.,"First, on the sea they blew; big rose the waves"
18551,BOOK XXIII.,Beneath the blast. At fruitful Troy arrived270
18552,BOOK XXIII.,"Vehement on the pile they fell, and dread"
18553,BOOK XXIII.,On all sides soon a crackling blaze ensued.
18554,BOOK XXIII.,"All night, together blowing shrill, they drove"
18555,BOOK XXIII.,"The sheeted flames wide from the funeral pile,"
18556,BOOK XXIII.,"And all night long, a goblet in his hand275"
18557,BOOK XXIII.,"From golden beakers fill’d, Achilles stood"
18558,BOOK XXIII.,"With large libations soaking deep the soil,"
18559,BOOK XXIII.,And calling on the spirit of his friend.
18560,BOOK XXIII.,"As some fond father mourns, burning the bones"
18561,BOOK XXIII.,"Of his own son, who, dying on the eve280"
18562,BOOK XXIII.,"Of his glad nuptials, hath his parents left"
18563,BOOK XXIII.,"O’erwhelm’d with inconsolable distress,"
18564,BOOK XXIII.,"So mourn’d Achilles, his companion’s bones"
18565,BOOK XXIII.,"Burning, and pacing to and fro the field"
18566,BOOK XXIII.,Beside the pile with many a sigh profound.285
18567,BOOK XXIII.,"But when the star, day’s harbinger, arose,"
18568,BOOK XXIII.,"Soon after whom, in saffron vest attired"
18569,BOOK XXIII.,"The morn her beams diffuses o’er the sea,"
18570,BOOK XXIII.,"The pile, then wasted, ceased to flame, and then"
18571,BOOK XXIII.,Back flew the Winds over the Thracian deep290
18572,BOOK XXIII.,Rolling the flood before them as they pass’d.
18573,BOOK XXIII.,And now Pelides lying down apart
18574,BOOK XXIII.,"From the funereal pile, slept, but not long,"
18575,BOOK XXIII.,Though weary; waken’d by the stir and din
18576,BOOK XXIII.,"Of Agamemnon’s train. He sat erect,295"
18577,BOOK XXIII.,And thus the leaders of the host address’d.
18578,BOOK XXIII.,"Atrides, and ye potentates who rule"
18579,BOOK XXIII.,The whole Achaian host! first quench the pile
18580,BOOK XXIII.,"Throughout with generous wine, where’er the fire"
18581,BOOK XXIII.,Hath seized it. We will then the bones collect300
18582,BOOK XXIII.,"Of Menœtiades, which shall with ease"
18583,BOOK XXIII.,"Be known, though many bones lie scatter’d near,"
18584,BOOK XXIII.,"Since in the middle pile Patroclus lay,"
18585,BOOK XXIII.,But wide apart and on its verge we burn’d
18586,BOOK XXIII.,"The steeds and Trojans, a promiscuous heap.305"
18587,BOOK XXIII.,Them so collected in a golden vase
18588,BOOK XXIII.,"We will dispose, lined with a double cawl,"
18589,BOOK XXIII.,"Till I shall, also, to my home below."
18590,BOOK XXIII.,"I wish not now a tomb of amplest bounds,"
18591,BOOK XXIII.,"But such as may suffice, which yet in height310"
18592,BOOK XXIII.,The Grecians and in breadth shall much augment
18593,BOOK XXIII.,"Hereafter, who, survivors of my fate,"
18594,BOOK XXIII.,Shall still remain in the Achaian fleet.
18595,BOOK XXIII.,"So spake Pelides, and the Chiefs complied."
18596,BOOK XXIII.,"Where’er the pile had blazed, with generous wine315"
18597,BOOK XXIII.,"They quench’d it, and the hills of ashes sank."
18598,BOOK XXIII.,"Then, weeping, to a golden vase, with lard"
18599,BOOK XXIII.,"Twice lined, they gave their gentle comrade’s bones"
18600,BOOK XXIII.,"Fire-bleach’d, and lodging safely in his tent"
18601,BOOK XXIII.,"The relics, overspread them with a veil.320"
18602,BOOK XXIII.,"Designing, next, the compass of the tomb,"
18603,BOOK XXIII.,"They mark’d its boundary with stones, then fill’d"
18604,BOOK XXIII.,"The wide enclosure hastily with earth,"
18605,BOOK XXIII.,"And, having heap’d it to its height, return’d."
18606,BOOK XXIII.,"But all the people, by Achilles still325"
18607,BOOK XXIII.,"Detain’d, there sitting, form’d a spacious ring,"
18608,BOOK XXIII.,And he the destined prizes from his fleet
18609,BOOK XXIII.,"Produced, capacious caldrons, tripods bright,"
18610,BOOK XXIII.,"Steeds, mules, tall oxen, women at the breast"
18611,BOOK XXIII.,"Close-cinctured, elegant, and unwrought[10] iron.330"
18612,BOOK XXIII.,"First, to the chariot-drivers he proposed"
18613,BOOK XXIII.,A noble prize; a beauteous maiden versed
18614,BOOK XXIII.,"In arts domestic, with a tripod ear’d,"
18615,BOOK XXIII.,Of twenty and two measures. These he made
18616,BOOK XXIII.,The conqueror’s meed. The second should a mare335
18617,BOOK XXIII.,"Obtain, unbroken yet, six years her age,"
18618,BOOK XXIII.,"Pregnant, and bearing in her womb a mule."
18619,BOOK XXIII.,"A caldron of four measures, never smirch’d"
18620,BOOK XXIII.,"By smoke or flame, but fresh as from the forge"
18621,BOOK XXIII.,The third awaited; to the fourth he gave340
18622,BOOK XXIII.,"Two golden talents, and, unsullied yet"
18623,BOOK XXIII.,"By use, a twin-ear’d phial[11] to the fifth."
18624,BOOK XXIII.,"He stood erect, and to the Greeks he cried."
18625,BOOK XXIII.,
18626,BOOK XXIII.,"Atrides, and ye chiefs of all the host!"
18627,BOOK XXIII.,"These prizes, in the circus placed, attend345"
18628,BOOK XXIII.,The charioteers. Held we the present games
18629,BOOK XXIII.,"In honor of some other Grecian dead,"
18630,BOOK XXIII.,I would myself bear hence the foremost prize;
18631,BOOK XXIII.,For ye are all witnesses well-inform’d
18632,BOOK XXIII.,Of the superior virtue of my steeds.350
18633,BOOK XXIII.,They are immortal; Neptune on my sire
18634,BOOK XXIII.,"Peleus conferr’d them, and my sire on me."
18635,BOOK XXIII.,"But neither I this contest share myself,"
18636,BOOK XXIII.,Nor shall my steeds; for they would miss the force
18637,BOOK XXIII.,And guidance of a charioteer so kind355
18638,BOOK XXIII.,"As they have lost, who many a time hath cleansed"
18639,BOOK XXIII.,"Their manes with water of the crystal brook,"
18640,BOOK XXIII.,"And made them sleek, himself, with limpid oil."
18641,BOOK XXIII.,"Him, therefore, mourning, motionless they stand"
18642,BOOK XXIII.,"With hair dishevell’d, streaming to the ground.360"
18643,BOOK XXIII.,"But ye, whoever of the host profess"
18644,BOOK XXIII.,"Superior skill, and glory in your steeds"
18645,BOOK XXIII.,"And well-built chariots, for the strife prepare!"
18646,BOOK XXIII.,"So spake Pelides, and the charioteers,"
18647,BOOK XXIII.,For speed renown’d arose. Long ere the rest365
18648,BOOK XXIII.,"Eumelus, King of men, Admetus’ son"
18649,BOOK XXIII.,"Arose, accomplish’d in equestrian arts."
18650,BOOK XXIII.,"Next, Tydeus’ son, brave Diomede, arose;"
18651,BOOK XXIII.,He yoked the Trojan coursers by himself
18652,BOOK XXIII.,"In battle from Æneas won, what time370"
18653,BOOK XXIII.,"Apollo saved their master. Third, upstood"
18654,BOOK XXIII.,"The son of Atreus with the golden locks,"
18655,BOOK XXIII.,Who to his chariot Agamemnon’s mare
18656,BOOK XXIII.,Swift Æthe and his own Podargus join’d.
18657,BOOK XXIII.,Her Echepolus from Anchises sprung375
18658,BOOK XXIII.,To Agamemnon gave; she was the price
18659,BOOK XXIII.,At which he purchased leave to dwell at home
18660,BOOK XXIII.,Excused attendance on the King at Troy;
18661,BOOK XXIII.,"For, by the gift of Jove, he had acquired"
18662,BOOK XXIII.,"Great riches, and in wide-spread Sicyon dwelt.380"
18663,BOOK XXIII.,"Her wing’d with ardor, Menelaus yoked."
18664,BOOK XXIII.,"Antilochus, arising fourth, his steeds"
18665,BOOK XXIII.,"Bright-maned prepared, son of the valiant King"
18666,BOOK XXIII.,"Of Pylus, Nestor Neleïades."
18667,BOOK XXIII.,"Of Pylian breed were they, and thus his sire,385"
18668,BOOK XXIII.,"With kind intent approaching to his side,"
18669,BOOK XXIII.,"Advised him, of himself not uninform’d.[12]"
18670,BOOK XXIII.,"Antilochus! Thou art, I know, beloved"
18671,BOOK XXIII.,"By Jove and Neptune both, from whom, though young"
18672,BOOK XXIII.,Thou hast received knowledge of every art390
18673,BOOK XXIII.,"Equestrian, and hast little need to learn."
18674,BOOK XXIII.,Thou know’st already how to trim the goal
18675,BOOK XXIII.,"With nicest skill, yet wondrous slow of foot"
18676,BOOK XXIII.,"Thy coursers are, whence evil may ensue."
18677,BOOK XXIII.,"But though their steeds be swifter, I account395"
18678,BOOK XXIII.,"Thee wise, at least, as they. Now is the time"
18679,BOOK XXIII.,"For counsel, furnish now thy mind with all"
18680,BOOK XXIII.,"Precaution, that the prize escape thee not."
18681,BOOK XXIII.,The feller of huge trees by skill prevails
18682,BOOK XXIII.,More than by strength; by skill the pilot guides400
18683,BOOK XXIII.,"His flying bark rock’d by tempestuous winds,"
18684,BOOK XXIII.,And more by skill than speed the race is won.
18685,BOOK XXIII.,But he who in his chariot and his steeds
18686,BOOK XXIII.,"Trusts only, wanders here and wanders there"
18687,BOOK XXIII.,"Unsteady, while his coursers loosely rein’d405"
18688,BOOK XXIII.,Roam wide the field; not so the charioteer
18689,BOOK XXIII.,Of sound intelligence; he though he drive
18690,BOOK XXIII.,"Inferior steeds, looks ever to the goal"
18691,BOOK XXIII.,"Which close he clips, not ignorant to check"
18692,BOOK XXIII.,His coursers at the first but with tight rein410
18693,BOOK XXIII.,"Ruling his own, and watching those before."
18694,BOOK XXIII.,Now mark; I will describe so plain the goal
18695,BOOK XXIII.,That thou shalt know it surely. A dry stump
18696,BOOK XXIII.,Extant above the ground an ell in height
18697,BOOK XXIII.,"Stands yonder; either oak it is, or pine415"
18698,BOOK XXIII.,"More likely, which the weather least impairs."
18699,BOOK XXIII.,"Two stones, both white, flank it on either hand."
18700,BOOK XXIII.,"The way is narrow there, but smooth the course"
18701,BOOK XXIII.,"On both sides. It is either, as I think,"
18702,BOOK XXIII.,"A monument of one long since deceased,420"
18703,BOOK XXIII.,"Or was, perchance, in ancient days design’d,"
18704,BOOK XXIII.,"As now by Peleus’ mighty son, a goal."
18705,BOOK XXIII.,"That mark in view, thy steeds and chariot push"
18706,BOOK XXIII.,"Near to it as thou may’st; then, in thy seat"
18707,BOOK XXIII.,"Inclining gently to the left, prick smart425"
18708,BOOK XXIII.,"Thy right-hand horse challenging him aloud,"
18709,BOOK XXIII.,And give him rein; but let thy left-hand horse
18710,BOOK XXIII.,"Bear on the goal so closely, that the nave"
18711,BOOK XXIII.,And felly[13] of thy wheel may seem to meet.
18712,BOOK XXIII.,"Yet fear to strike the stone, lest foul disgrace430"
18713,BOOK XXIII.,Of broken chariot and of crippled steeds
18714,BOOK XXIII.,"Ensue, and thou become the public jest."
18715,BOOK XXIII.,My boy beloved! use caution; for if once
18716,BOOK XXIII.,"Thou turn the goal at speed, no man thenceforth"
18717,BOOK XXIII.,"Shall reach, or if he reach, shall pass thee by,435"
18718,BOOK XXIII.,Although Arion in thy rear he drove
18719,BOOK XXIII.,"Adrastus’ rapid horse of race divine,"
18720,BOOK XXIII.,"Or those, Troy’s boast, bred by Laomedon."
18721,BOOK XXIII.,"So Nestor spake, inculcating with care"
18722,BOOK XXIII.,"On his son’s mind these lessons in the art,440"
18723,BOOK XXIII.,"And to his place retiring, sat again."
18724,BOOK XXIII.,Meriones his coursers glossy-maned
18725,BOOK XXIII.,Made ready last. Then to his chariot-seat
18726,BOOK XXIII.,"Each mounted, and the lots were thrown; himself"
18727,BOOK XXIII.,"Achilles shook them. First, forth leap’d the lot445"
18728,BOOK XXIII.,"Of Nestor’s son Antilochus, after whom"
18729,BOOK XXIII.,The King Eumelus took his destined place.
18730,BOOK XXIII.,The third was Menelaus spear-renown’d;
18731,BOOK XXIII.,"Meriones the fourth; and last of all,"
18732,BOOK XXIII.,"Bravest of all, heroic Diomede450"
18733,BOOK XXIII.,The son of Tydeus took his lot to drive.
18734,BOOK XXIII.,So ranged they stood; Achilles show’d the goal
18735,BOOK XXIII.,"Far on the champain, nigh to which he placed"
18736,BOOK XXIII.,"The godlike Phœnix servant of his sire,"
18737,BOOK XXIII.,To mark the race and make a true report.455
18738,BOOK XXIII.,"All raised the lash at once, and with the reins"
18739,BOOK XXIII.,"At once all smote their steeds, urging them on"
18740,BOOK XXIII.,"Vociferous; they, sudden, left the fleet"
18741,BOOK XXIII.,"Far, far behind them, scouring swift the plain."
18742,BOOK XXIII.,"Dark, like a stormy cloud, uprose the dust460"
18743,BOOK XXIII.,"Their chests beneath, and scatter’d in the wind"
18744,BOOK XXIII.,Their manes all floated; now the chariots swept
18745,BOOK XXIII.,"The low declivity unseen, and now"
18746,BOOK XXIII.,Emerging started into view; erect
18747,BOOK XXIII.,"The drivers stood; emulous, every heart465"
18748,BOOK XXIII.,Beat double; each encouraged loud his steeds;
18749,BOOK XXIII.,"They, flying, fill’d with dust the darken’d air."
18750,BOOK XXIII.,But when returning to the hoary deep
18751,BOOK XXIII.,"They ran their last career, then each display’d"
18752,BOOK XXIII.,"Brightest his charioteership, and the race470"
18753,BOOK XXIII.,"Lay stretch’d, at once, into its utmost speed."
18754,BOOK XXIII.,"Then, soon the mares of Pheretiades[14]"
18755,BOOK XXIII.,"Pass’d all, but Diomede behind him came,"
18756,BOOK XXIII.,Borne by his unemasculated steeds
18757,BOOK XXIII.,"Of Trojan pedigree; they not remote,475"
18758,BOOK XXIII.,But close pursued him; and at every pace
18759,BOOK XXIII.,"Seem’d entering both; the chariot at their head,"
18760,BOOK XXIII.,For blowing warm into Eumelus’ neck
18761,BOOK XXIII.,"Behind, and on his shoulders broad, they went,"
18762,BOOK XXIII.,And their chins rested on him as they flew.480
18763,BOOK XXIII.,"Then had Tydides pass’d him, or had made"
18764,BOOK XXIII.,"Decision dubious, but Apollo struck,"
18765,BOOK XXIII.,"Resentful,[15] from his hand the glittering scourge."
18766,BOOK XXIII.,"Fast roll’d the tears indignant down his cheeks,"
18767,BOOK XXIII.,"For he beheld the mares with double speed,485"
18768,BOOK XXIII.,"Flying, and of the spur deprived, his own"
18769,BOOK XXIII.,Retarded steeds continual thrown behind.
18770,BOOK XXIII.,But not unnoticed by Minerva pass’d
18771,BOOK XXIII.,The art by Phœbus practised to impede
18772,BOOK XXIII.,"The son of Tydeus, whom with winged haste490"
18773,BOOK XXIII.,"Following, she gave to him his scourge again,"
18774,BOOK XXIII.,And with new force his lagging steeds inspired.
18775,BOOK XXIII.,"Eumelus, next, the angry Goddess, swift"
18776,BOOK XXIII.,"Pursuing, snapt his yoke; wide flew the mares"
18777,BOOK XXIII.,"Asunder, and the pole fell to the ground.495"
18778,BOOK XXIII.,"Himself, roll’d from his seat, fast by the wheel"
18779,BOOK XXIII.,"With lacerated elbows, nostrils, mouth,"
18780,BOOK XXIII.,And batter’d brows lay prone; sorrow his eyes
18781,BOOK XXIII.,"Deluged, and disappointment chok’d his voice."
18782,BOOK XXIII.,"Then, far outstripping all, Tydides push’d500"
18783,BOOK XXIII.,"His steeds beyond, which Pallas fill’d with power"
18784,BOOK XXIII.,That she might make the glorious prize his own.
18785,BOOK XXIII.,"Him follow’d Menelaus amber-hair’d,"
18786,BOOK XXIII.,"The son of Atreus, and his father’s steeds"
18787,BOOK XXIII.,"Encouraging, thus spake Antilochus.505"
18788,BOOK XXIII.,Away—now stretch ye forward to the goal.
18789,BOOK XXIII.,I bid you not to an unequal strife
18790,BOOK XXIII.,"With those of Diomede, for Pallas them"
18791,BOOK XXIII.,"Quickens that he may conquer, and the Chief"
18792,BOOK XXIII.,So far advanced makes competition vain.510
18793,BOOK XXIII.,"But reach the son of Atreus, fly to reach"
18794,BOOK XXIII.,"His steeds, incontinent; ah, be not shamed"
18795,BOOK XXIII.,"For ever, foil’d by Æthe, by a mare!"
18796,BOOK XXIII.,"Why fall ye thus behind, my noblest steeds?"
18797,BOOK XXIII.,"I tell you both, and ye shall prove me true,515"
18798,BOOK XXIII.,"No favor shall ye find at Nestor’s hands,"
18799,BOOK XXIII.,"My valiant sire, but he will thrust his spear"
18800,BOOK XXIII.,"Right through you, should we lose, for sloth of yours,"
18801,BOOK XXIII.,"Or by your negligence, the nobler prize."
18802,BOOK XXIII.,Haste then—pursue him—reach the royal Chief—520
18803,BOOK XXIII.,And how to pass him in yon narrow way
18804,BOOK XXIII.,"Shall be my care, and not my care in vain."
18805,BOOK XXIII.,"He ended; they, awhile, awed by his voice,"
18806,BOOK XXIII.,"With more exertion ran, and Nestor’s son"
18807,BOOK XXIII.,Now saw the hollow strait mark’d by his sire.525
18808,BOOK XXIII.,"It was a chasm abrupt, where winter-floods,"
18809,BOOK XXIII.,"Wearing the soil, had gullied deep the way."
18810,BOOK XXIII.,"Thither Atrides, anxious to avoid"
18811,BOOK XXIII.,"A clash of chariots drove, and thither drove"
18812,BOOK XXIII.,"Also, but somewhat devious from his track,530"
18813,BOOK XXIII.,"Antilochus. Then Menelaus fear’d,"
18814,BOOK XXIII.,And with loud voice the son of Nestor hail’d.
18815,BOOK XXIII.,"Antilochus, at what a madman’s rate"
18816,BOOK XXIII.,Drivest thou! stop—check thy steeds—the way is here
18817,BOOK XXIII.,"Too strait, but widening soon, will give thee scope535"
18818,BOOK XXIII.,"To pass me by; beware, lest chariot close"
18819,BOOK XXIII.,"To chariot driven, thou maim thyself and me."
18820,BOOK XXIII.,He said; but still more rapid and the scourge
18821,BOOK XXIII.,"Plying continual, as he had not heard,"
18822,BOOK XXIII.,Antilochus came on. Far as the quoit540
18823,BOOK XXIII.,By some broad-shoulder’d youth for trial hurl’d
18824,BOOK XXIII.,"Of manhood flies, so far Antilochus"
18825,BOOK XXIII.,Shot forward; but the coursers fell behind
18826,BOOK XXIII.,"Of Atreus’ son, who now abated much"
18827,BOOK XXIII.,"By choice his driving, lest the steeds of both545"
18828,BOOK XXIII.,"Jostling, should overturn with sudden shock"
18829,BOOK XXIII.,"Both chariots, and themselves in dust be roll’d,"
18830,BOOK XXIII.,Through hot ambition of the foremost prize.
18831,BOOK XXIII.,Him then the hero golden-hair’d reproved.
18832,BOOK XXIII.,Antilochus! the man lives not on earth550
18833,BOOK XXIII.,"Like thee for love of mischief. Go, extoll’d"
18834,BOOK XXIII.,For wisdom falsely by the sons of Greece.
18835,BOOK XXIII.,"Yet, trust me, not without an oath, the prize"
18836,BOOK XXIII.,Thus foully sought shall even now be thine.
18837,BOOK XXIII.,"He said, and to his coursers call’d aloud.555"
18838,BOOK XXIII.,Ah be not tardy; stand not sorrow-check’d;
18839,BOOK XXIII.,"Their feet will fail them sooner far than yours,"
18840,BOOK XXIII.,For years have pass’d since they had youth to boast.
18841,BOOK XXIII.,"So he; and springing at his voice, his steeds"
18842,BOOK XXIII.,Regain’d apace the vantage lost. Meantime560
18843,BOOK XXIII.,"The Grecians, in full circus seated, mark’d"
18844,BOOK XXIII.,"The steeds; they flying, fill’d with dust the air."
18845,BOOK XXIII.,"Then, ere the rest, Idomeneus discern’d"
18846,BOOK XXIII.,"The foremost pair; for, on a rising ground"
18847,BOOK XXIII.,"Exalted, he without the circus sat,565"
18848,BOOK XXIII.,"And hearing, though remote, the driver’s voice"
18849,BOOK XXIII.,"Chiding his steeds, knew it, and knew beside"
18850,BOOK XXIII.,"The leader horse distinguish’d by his hue,"
18851,BOOK XXIII.,"Chestnut throughout, save that his forehead bore"
18852,BOOK XXIII.,"A splendid blazon white, round as the moon.570"
18853,BOOK XXIII.,"He stood erect, and to the Greeks he cried."
18854,BOOK XXIII.,Friends! Chiefs and senators of Argos’ host!
18855,BOOK XXIII.,"Discern I sole the steeds, or also ye?"
18856,BOOK XXIII.,"The horses, foremost now, to me appear"
18857,BOOK XXIII.,"Other than erst, and I descry at hand575"
18858,BOOK XXIII.,A different charioteer; the mares of late
18859,BOOK XXIII.,"Victorious, somewhere distant in the race"
18860,BOOK XXIII.,Are hurt; I plainly saw them at the first
18861,BOOK XXIII.,"Turning the goal, but see them now no more;"
18862,BOOK XXIII.,And yet with eyes inquisitive I range580
18863,BOOK XXIII.,From side to side the whole broad plain of Troy.
18864,BOOK XXIII.,"Either the charioteer hath slipp’d the reins,"
18865,BOOK XXIII.,Or rounded not successfully the goal
18866,BOOK XXIII.,"Through want of guidance. Thrown, as it should seem,"
18867,BOOK XXIII.,"Forth from his seat, he hath his chariot maim’d,585"
18868,BOOK XXIII.,And his ungovern’d steeds have roam’d away.
18869,BOOK XXIII.,"Arise and look ye forth yourselves, for I"
18870,BOOK XXIII.,With doubtful ken behold him; yet the man
18871,BOOK XXIII.,"Seems, in my view, Ætolian by descent,"
18872,BOOK XXIII.,"A Chief of prime renown in Argos’ host,590"
18873,BOOK XXIII.,"The hero Tydeus’ son, brave Diomede,"
18874,BOOK XXIII.,But Ajax Oïliades the swift
18875,BOOK XXIII.,Him sharp reproved. Why art thou always given
18876,BOOK XXIII.,"To prate, Idomeneus? thou seest the mares,"
18877,BOOK XXIII.,"Remote indeed, but posting to the goal.595"
18878,BOOK XXIII.,Thou art not youngest of the Argives here
18879,BOOK XXIII.,"So much, nor from beneath thy brows look forth"
18880,BOOK XXIII.,"Quick-sighted more than ours, thine eyes abroad."
18881,BOOK XXIII.,"Yet still thou pratest, although silence more"
18882,BOOK XXIII.,"Should suit thee, among wiser far than thou.600"
18883,BOOK XXIII.,"The mares which led, lead still, and he who drives"
18884,BOOK XXIII.,"Eumelus is, the same who drove before."
18885,BOOK XXIII.,"To whom the Cretan Chief, angry, replied."
18886,BOOK XXIII.,Ajax! whom none in wrangling can excel
18887,BOOK XXIII.,"Or rudeness, though in all beside thou fall605"
18888,BOOK XXIII.,"Below the Argives, being boorish-rough,"
18889,BOOK XXIII.,"Come now—a tripod let us wager each,"
18890,BOOK XXIII.,"Or caldron, and let Agamemnon judge"
18891,BOOK XXIII.,"Whose horses lead, that, losing, thou may’st learn."
18892,BOOK XXIII.,He said; then sudden from his seat upsprang610
18893,BOOK XXIII.,"Swift Ajax Oïliades, prepared"
18894,BOOK XXIII.,"For harsh retort, nor had the contest ceased"
18895,BOOK XXIII.,"Between them, but had grown from ill to worse,"
18896,BOOK XXIII.,"Had not himself, Achilles, interposed."
18897,BOOK XXIII.,Ajax—Idomeneus—abstain ye both615
18898,BOOK XXIII.,"From bitter speech offensive, and such terms"
18899,BOOK XXIII.,"As ill become you. Ye would feel, yourselves,"
18900,BOOK XXIII.,"Resentment, should another act as ye."
18901,BOOK XXIII.,"Survey the course, peaceable, from your seats;"
18902,BOOK XXIII.,"The charioteers, by competition wing’d,620"
18903,BOOK XXIII.,"Will soon themselves arrive, then shall ye know"
18904,BOOK XXIII.,"Distinctly, both who follows and who leads."
18905,BOOK XXIII.,"He scarce had said, when nigh at hand appear’d"
18906,BOOK XXIII.,"Tydides, lashing, as he came, his steeds"
18907,BOOK XXIII.,Continual; they with hoofs uplifted high625
18908,BOOK XXIII.,"Their yet remaining ground shorten’d apace,"
18909,BOOK XXIII.,Sprinkling with dusty drops at every stroke
18910,BOOK XXIII.,"Their charioteer, while close upon their heels"
18911,BOOK XXIII.,"Radiant with tin and gold the chariot ran,"
18912,BOOK XXIII.,"Scarce tracking light the dust, so swift they flew.630"
18913,BOOK XXIII.,He stood in the mid-circus; there the sweat
18914,BOOK XXIII.,"Rain’d under them from neck and chest profuse,"
18915,BOOK XXIII.,And Diomede from his resplendent seat
18916,BOOK XXIII.,"Leaping, reclined his scourge against the yoke."
18917,BOOK XXIII.,"Nor was his friend brave Sthenelus remiss,635"
18918,BOOK XXIII.,"But, seizing with alacrity the prize,"
18919,BOOK XXIII.,"Consign’d the tripod and the virgin, first,"
18920,BOOK XXIII.,"To his own band in charge; then, loosed the steeds."
18921,BOOK XXIII.,"Next came, by stratagem, not speed advanced"
18922,BOOK XXIII.,"To that distinction, Nestor’s son, whom yet640"
18923,BOOK XXIII.,The hero Menelaus close pursued
18924,BOOK XXIII.,"Near as the wheel runs to a courser’s heels,"
18925,BOOK XXIII.,Drawing his master at full speed; his tail
18926,BOOK XXIII.,With its extremest hairs the felly sweeps
18927,BOOK XXIII.,"That close attends him o’er the spacious plain,645"
18928,BOOK XXIII.,So near had Menelaus now approach’d
18929,BOOK XXIII.,Antilochus; for though at first he fell
18930,BOOK XXIII.,"A full quoit’s cast behind, he soon retrieved"
18931,BOOK XXIII.,"That loss, with such increasing speed the mare"
18932,BOOK XXIII.,"Bright-maned of Agamemnon, Æthe, ran;650"
18933,BOOK XXIII.,"She, had the course few paces more to both"
18934,BOOK XXIII.,"Afforded, should have clearly shot beyond"
18935,BOOK XXIII.,"Antilochus, nor dubious left the prize."
18936,BOOK XXIII.,But noble Menelaus threw behind
18937,BOOK XXIII.,"Meriones, companion in the field,655"
18938,BOOK XXIII.,"Of King Idomeneus, a lance’s flight,"
18939,BOOK XXIII.,"For slowest were his steeds, and he, to rule"
18940,BOOK XXIII.,"The chariot in the race, least skill’d of all."
18941,BOOK XXIII.,"Last came Eumelus drawing to the goal,"
18942,BOOK XXIII.,"Himself, his splendid chariot, and his mares660"
18943,BOOK XXIII.,Driving before him. Peleus’ rapid son
18944,BOOK XXIII.,"Beheld him with compassion, and, amid"
18945,BOOK XXIII.,"The Argives, in wing’d accents thus he spake."
18946,BOOK XXIII.,"Here comes the most expert, driving his steeds"
18947,BOOK XXIII.,Before him. Just it were that he received665
18948,BOOK XXIII.,The second prize; Tydides claims the first.
18949,BOOK XXIII.,"He said, and all applauded the award."
18950,BOOK XXIII.,Then had Achilles to Eumelus given
18951,BOOK XXIII.,The mare (for such the pleasure seem’d of all)
18952,BOOK XXIII.,"Had not the son of mighty Nestor risen,670"
18953,BOOK XXIII.,"Antilochus, who pleaded thus his right."
18954,BOOK XXIII.,"Achilles! acting as thou hast proposed,"
18955,BOOK XXIII.,"Thou shalt offend me much, for thou shalt take"
18956,BOOK XXIII.,"The prize from me, because the Gods, his steeds"
18957,BOOK XXIII.,"And chariot-yoke disabling, render’d vain675"
18958,BOOK XXIII.,"His efforts, and no failure of his own."
18959,BOOK XXIII.,It was his duty to have sought the Gods
18960,BOOK XXIII.,"In prayer, then had he not, following on foot"
18961,BOOK XXIII.,"His coursers, hindmost of us all arrived."
18962,BOOK XXIII.,"But if thou pity him, and deem it good,680"
18963,BOOK XXIII.,"Thou hast much gold, much brass, and many sheep"
18964,BOOK XXIII.,"In thy pavilion; thou hast maidens fair,"
18965,BOOK XXIII.,And coursers also. Of thy proper stores
18966,BOOK XXIII.,Hereafter give to him a richer prize
18967,BOOK XXIII.,"Than this, or give it now, so shall the Greeks685"
18968,BOOK XXIII.,Applaud thee; but this mare yield I to none;
18969,BOOK XXIII.,Stand forth the Grecian who desires to win
18970,BOOK XXIII.,"That recompense, and let him fight with me."
18971,BOOK XXIII.,"He ended, and Achilles, godlike Chief,"
18972,BOOK XXIII.,"Smiled on him, gratulating his success,690"
18973,BOOK XXIII.,"Whom much he loved; then, ardent, thus replied."
18974,BOOK XXIII.,Antilochus! if thou wouldst wish me give
18975,BOOK XXIII.,"Eumelus of my own, even so I will."
18976,BOOK XXIII.,I will present to him my corslet bright
18977,BOOK XXIII.,"Won from Asteropæus, edged around695"
18978,BOOK XXIII.,"With glittering tin; a precious gift, and rare."
18979,BOOK XXIII.,"So saying, he bade Automedon his friend"
18980,BOOK XXIII.,Produce it from the tent; he at his word
18981,BOOK XXIII.,"Departing, to Achilles brought the spoil,"
18982,BOOK XXIII.,Which at his hands Eumelus glad received.700
18983,BOOK XXIII.,"Then, stung with grief, and with resentment fired"
18984,BOOK XXIII.,"Immeasurable, Menelaus rose"
18985,BOOK XXIII.,To charge Antilochus. His herald gave
18986,BOOK XXIII.,"The sceptre to his hand, and (silence bidden"
18987,BOOK XXIII.,To all) the godlike hero thus began.705
18988,BOOK XXIII.,Antilochus! oh heretofore discreet!
18989,BOOK XXIII.,What hast thou done? Thou hast dishonor’d foul
18990,BOOK XXIII.,"My skill, and wrong’d my coursers, throwing thine,"
18991,BOOK XXIII.,"Although inferior far, by fraud before them."
18992,BOOK XXIII.,Ye Chiefs and Senators of Argos’ host!710
18993,BOOK XXIII.,"Impartial judge between us, lest, of these,"
18994,BOOK XXIII.,"Some say hereafter, Menelaus bore"
18995,BOOK XXIII.,"Antilochus by falsehood down, and led"
18996,BOOK XXIII.,"The mare away, because, although his steeds"
18997,BOOK XXIII.,"Were worse, his arm was mightier, and prevail’d.715"
18998,BOOK XXIII.,"Yet hold—myself will judge, and will to all"
18999,BOOK XXIII.,"Contentment give, for I will judge aright."
19000,BOOK XXIII.,"Hither, Antilochus, illustrious youth!"
19001,BOOK XXIII.,"And, as the law prescribes, standing before"
19002,BOOK XXIII.,"Thy steeds and chariot, holding too the scourge720"
19003,BOOK XXIII.,"With which thou drovest, lay hand on both thy steeds,"
19004,BOOK XXIII.,"And swear by Neptune, circler of the earth,"
19005,BOOK XXIII.,"That neither wilfully, nor yet by fraud"
19006,BOOK XXIII.,Thou didst impede my chariot in its course.
19007,BOOK XXIII.,"Then prudent, thus Antilochus replied.725"
19008,BOOK XXIII.,Oh royal Menelaus! patient bear
19009,BOOK XXIII.,"The fault of one thy junior far, in years"
19010,BOOK XXIII.,Alike unequal and in worth to thee.
19011,BOOK XXIII.,"Thou know’st how rash is youth, and how propense"
19012,BOOK XXIII.,"To pass the bounds by decency prescribed,730"
19013,BOOK XXIII.,"Quick, but not wise. Lay, then, thy wrath aside;"
19014,BOOK XXIII.,The mare now given me I will myself
19015,BOOK XXIII.,"Deliver to thee, and if thou require"
19016,BOOK XXIII.,"A larger recompense, will rather yield"
19017,BOOK XXIII.,A larger much than from thy favor fall735
19018,BOOK XXIII.,"Deservedly for ever, mighty Prince!"
19019,BOOK XXIII.,And sin so heinously against the Gods.
19020,BOOK XXIII.,"So saying, the son of valiant Nestor led"
19021,BOOK XXIII.,"The mare, himself, to Menelaus’ hand,"
19022,BOOK XXIII.,Who with heart-freshening joy the prize received.740
19023,BOOK XXIII.,As on the ears of growing corn the dews
19024,BOOK XXIII.,"Fall grateful, while the spiry grain erect"
19025,BOOK XXIII.,"Bristles the fields, so, Menelaus, felt"
19026,BOOK XXIII.,Thy inmost soul a soothing pleasure sweet!
19027,BOOK XXIII.,Then answer thus the hero quick return’d.745
19028,BOOK XXIII.,"Antilochus! exasperate though I were,"
19029,BOOK XXIII.,"Now, such no longer, I relinquish glad"
19030,BOOK XXIII.,"All strife with thee, for that at other times"
19031,BOOK XXIII.,"Thou never inconsiderate wast or light,"
19032,BOOK XXIII.,Although by youthful heat misled to-day.750
19033,BOOK XXIII.,Yet safer is it not to over-reach
19034,BOOK XXIII.,"Superiors, for no other Grecian here"
19035,BOOK XXIII.,Had my extreme displeasure calm’d so soon;
19036,BOOK XXIII.,"But thou hast suffer’d much, and much hast toil’d,"
19037,BOOK XXIII.,"As thy good father and thy brother have,755"
19038,BOOK XXIII.,"On my behalf; I, therefore, yield, subdued"
19039,BOOK XXIII.,"By thy entreaties, and the mare, though mine,"
19040,BOOK XXIII.,"Will also give thee, that these Grecians all"
19041,BOOK XXIII.,May know me neither proud nor hard to appease.
19042,BOOK XXIII.,"So saying, the mare he to Noëmon gave,760"
19043,BOOK XXIII.,"Friend of Antilochus, and, well-content,"
19044,BOOK XXIII.,The polish’d caldron for _his_ prize received.
19045,BOOK XXIII.,The fourth awarded lot (for he had fourth
19046,BOOK XXIII.,"Arrived) Meriones asserted next,"
19047,BOOK XXIII.,The golden talents; but the phial still765
19048,BOOK XXIII.,Left unappropriated Achilles bore
19049,BOOK XXIII.,"Across the circus in his hand, a gift"
19050,BOOK XXIII.,"To ancient Nestor, whom he thus bespake."
19051,BOOK XXIII.,"Thou also, oh my father! this accept,"
19052,BOOK XXIII.,Which in remembrance of the funeral rites770
19053,BOOK XXIII.,"Of my Patroclus, keep, for him thou seest"
19054,BOOK XXIII.,"Among the Greeks no more. Receive a prize,"
19055,BOOK XXIII.,Thine by gratuity; for thou shalt wield
19056,BOOK XXIII.,"The cestus, wrestle, at the spear contend,"
19057,BOOK XXIII.,Or in the foot-race (fallen as thou art775
19058,BOOK XXIII.,Into the wane of life) never again.
19059,BOOK XXIII.,"He said, and placed it in his hands. He, glad,"
19060,BOOK XXIII.,"Receiving it, in accents wing’d replied."
19061,BOOK XXIII.,"True, oh my son! is all which thou hast spoken."
19062,BOOK XXIII.,"These limbs, these hands, young friend! (their vigor lost)780"
19063,BOOK XXIII.,"No longer, darted from the shoulder, spring"
19064,BOOK XXIII.,At once to battle. Ah that I could grow
19065,BOOK XXIII.,"Young yet again, could feel again such force"
19066,BOOK XXIII.,"Athletic, as when in Buprasium erst"
19067,BOOK XXIII.,The Epeans with sepulchral pomp entomb’d785
19068,BOOK XXIII.,"King Amarynceus, where his sons ordain’d"
19069,BOOK XXIII.,Funereal games in honor of their sire!
19070,BOOK XXIII.,Epean none or even Pylian there
19071,BOOK XXIII.,"Could cope with me, or yet Ætolian bold."
19072,BOOK XXIII.,"Boxing, I vanquish’d Clytomedes, son790"
19073,BOOK XXIII.,"Of Enops; wrestling, the Pleuronian Chief"
19074,BOOK XXIII.,"Ancæus; in the foot-race Iphiclus,"
19075,BOOK XXIII.,Though a fleet runner; and I over-pitch’d
19076,BOOK XXIII.,Phyleus and Polydorus at the spear.
19077,BOOK XXIII.,The sons of Actor[16] in the chariot-race795
19078,BOOK XXIII.,"Alone surpass’d me, being two for one,"
19079,BOOK XXIII.,And jealous both lest I should also win
19080,BOOK XXIII.,"That prize, for to the victor charioteer"
19081,BOOK XXIII.,They had assign’d the noblest prize of all.
19082,BOOK XXIII.,"They were twin-brothers, and one ruled the steeds,800"
19083,BOOK XXIII.,"The steeds one ruled,[17] the other lash’d them on."
19084,BOOK XXIII.,"Such once was I; but now, these sports I leave"
19085,BOOK XXIII.,To younger; me submission most befits
19086,BOOK XXIII.,"To withering age, who then outshone the best."
19087,BOOK XXIII.,But go. The funeral of thy friend with games805
19088,BOOK XXIII.,Proceed to celebrate; I accept thy gift
19089,BOOK XXIII.,With pleasure; and my heart is also glad
19090,BOOK XXIII.,That thou art mindful evermore of one
19091,BOOK XXIII.,"Who loves thee, and such honor in the sight"
19092,BOOK XXIII.,"Yield’st me of all the Greeks, as is my due.810"
19093,BOOK XXIII.,May the Gods bless thee for it more and more!
19094,BOOK XXIII.,"He spake, and Peleus’ son, when he had heard"
19095,BOOK XXIII.,At large his commendation from the lips
19096,BOOK XXIII.,"Of Nestor, through the assembled Greeks return’d."
19097,BOOK XXIII.,"He next proposed, not lightly to be won,815"
19098,BOOK XXIII.,"The boxer’s prize. He tether’d down a mule,"
19099,BOOK XXIII.,"Untamed and hard to tame, but strong to toil,"
19100,BOOK XXIII.,"And in her prime of vigor, in the midst;"
19101,BOOK XXIII.,"A goblet to the vanquish’d he assign’d,"
19102,BOOK XXIII.,Then stood erect and to the Greeks exclaim’d.820
19103,BOOK XXIII.,Atridæ! and ye Argives brazen-greaved!
19104,BOOK XXIII.,I call for two bold combatants expert
19105,BOOK XXIII.,"To wage fierce strife for these, with lifted fists"
19106,BOOK XXIII.,"Smiting each other. He, who by the aid"
19107,BOOK XXIII.,"Of Phœbus shall o’ertome, and whom the Greeks825"
19108,BOOK XXIII.,"Shall all pronounce victorious, leads the mule"
19109,BOOK XXIII.,Hence to his tent; the vanquish’d takes the cup.
19110,BOOK XXIII.,"He spake, and at his word a Greek arose"
19111,BOOK XXIII.,"Big, bold, and skillful in the boxer’s art,"
19112,BOOK XXIII.,"Epeüs, son of Panopeus; his hand830"
19113,BOOK XXIII.,"He on the mule imposed, and thus he said."
19114,BOOK XXIII.,Approach the man ambitious of the cup!
19115,BOOK XXIII.,For no Achaian here shall with his fist
19116,BOOK XXIII.,"Me foiling, win the mule. I boast myself"
19117,BOOK XXIII.,To all superior. May it not suffice835
19118,BOOK XXIII.,That I to no pre-eminence pretend
19119,BOOK XXIII.,In battle? To attain to foremost praise
19120,BOOK XXIII.,Alike in every art is not for one.
19121,BOOK XXIII.,"But this I promise, and will well perform—"
19122,BOOK XXIII.,"My blows shall lay him open, split him, crush840"
19123,BOOK XXIII.,"His bones to splinters, and let all his friends,"
19124,BOOK XXIII.,"Attendant on him, wait to bear him hence,"
19125,BOOK XXIII.,Vanquish’d by my superior force in fight.
19126,BOOK XXIII.,"He ended, and his speech found no reply."
19127,BOOK XXIII.,"One godlike Chief alone, Euryalus,845"
19128,BOOK XXIII.,"Son of the King Mecisteus, who, himself,"
19129,BOOK XXIII.,"Sprang from Talaion, opposite arose."
19130,BOOK XXIII.,"He, on the death of Oedipus, at Thebes"
19131,BOOK XXIII.,"Contending in the games held at his tomb,"
19132,BOOK XXIII.,Had overcome the whole Cadmean race.850
19133,BOOK XXIII.,"Him Diomede spear-famed for fight prepared,"
19134,BOOK XXIII.,"Giving him all encouragement, for much"
19135,BOOK XXIII.,He wish’d him victory. First then he threw[18]
19136,BOOK XXIII.,"His cincture to him; next, he gave him thongs[19]"
19137,BOOK XXIII.,Cut from the hide of a wild buffalo.855
19138,BOOK XXIII.,"Both girt around, into the midst they moved."
19139,BOOK XXIII.,"Then, lifting high their brawny arms, and fists"
19140,BOOK XXIII.,"Mingling with fists, to furious fight they fell;"
19141,BOOK XXIII.,"Dire was the crash of jaws, and the sweat stream’d"
19142,BOOK XXIII.,"From every limb. Epeüs fierce advanced,860"
19143,BOOK XXIII.,And while Euryalus with cautious eye
19144,BOOK XXIII.,"Watch’d his advantage, pash’d him on the cheek"
19145,BOOK XXIII.,"He stood no longer, but, his shapely limbs,"
19146,BOOK XXIII.,"Unequal to his weight, sinking, he fell."
19147,BOOK XXIII.,As by the rising north-wind driven ashore865
19148,BOOK XXIII.,"A huge fish flounces on the weedy beach,"
19149,BOOK XXIII.,"Which soon the sable flood covers again,"
19150,BOOK XXIII.,"So, beaten down, he bounded. But Epeüs,"
19151,BOOK XXIII.,"Heroic chief, upraised him by his hand,"
19152,BOOK XXIII.,And his own comrades from the circus forth870
19153,BOOK XXIII.,"Led him, step dragging after step, the blood"
19154,BOOK XXIII.,"Ejecting grumous, and at every pace"
19155,BOOK XXIII.,Rolling his head languid from side to side.
19156,BOOK XXIII.,They placed him all unconscious on his seat
19157,BOOK XXIII.,"In his own band, then fetch’d his prize, the cup.875"
19158,BOOK XXIII.,"Still other prizes, then, Achilles placed"
19159,BOOK XXIII.,"In view of all, the sturdy wrestler’s meed."
19160,BOOK XXIII.,"A large hearth-tripod, valued by the Greeks"
19161,BOOK XXIII.,"At twice six beeves, should pay the victor’s toil;"
19162,BOOK XXIII.,"But for the vanquish’d, in the midst he set880"
19163,BOOK XXIII.,A damsel in variety expert
19164,BOOK XXIII.,"Of arts domestic, valued at four beeves."
19165,BOOK XXIII.,"He rose erect, and to the Greeks he cried."
19166,BOOK XXIII.,"Arise ye, now, who shall this prize dispute."
19167,BOOK XXIII.,So spake the son of Peleus; then arose885
19168,BOOK XXIII.,"Huge Telamonian Ajax, and upstood"
19169,BOOK XXIII.,"Ulysses also, in all wiles adept."
19170,BOOK XXIII.,"Both girt around, into the midst they moved."
19171,BOOK XXIII.,"With vigorous gripe each lock’d the other fast,"
19172,BOOK XXIII.,"Like rafters, standing, of some mansion built890"
19173,BOOK XXIII.,By a prime artist proof against all winds.
19174,BOOK XXIII.,"Their backs, tugg’d vehemently, creak’d,[20] the sweat"
19175,BOOK XXIII.,"Trickled, and on their flanks and shoulders, red"
19176,BOOK XXIII.,The whelks arose; they bearing still in mind
19177,BOOK XXIII.,"The tripod, ceased not struggling for the prize.895"
19178,BOOK XXIII.,Nor could Ulysses from his station move
19179,BOOK XXIII.,"And cast down Ajax, nor could Ajax him"
19180,BOOK XXIII.,"Unsettle, fixt so firm Ulysses stood."
19181,BOOK XXIII.,"But when, long time expectant, all the Greeks"
19182,BOOK XXIII.,"Grew weary, then, huge Ajax him bespake.900"
19183,BOOK XXIII.,"Laertes’ noble son, for wiles renown’d!"
19184,BOOK XXIII.,"Lift, or be lifted, and let Jove decide."
19185,BOOK XXIII.,"He said, and heaved Ulysses. Then, his wiles"
19186,BOOK XXIII.,"Forgat not he, but on the ham behind"
19187,BOOK XXIII.,Chopp’d him; the limbs of Ajax at the stroke905
19188,BOOK XXIII.,"Disabled sank; he fell supine, and bore"
19189,BOOK XXIII.,Ulysses close adhering to his chest
19190,BOOK XXIII.,Down with him. Wonder riveted all eyes.
19191,BOOK XXIII.,Then brave Ulysses from the ground awhile
19192,BOOK XXIII.,"Him lifted in his turn, but ere he stood,910"
19193,BOOK XXIII.,Inserting his own knee the knees between[21]
19194,BOOK XXIII.,"Of Ajax, threw him. To the earth they fell"
19195,BOOK XXIII.,"Both, and with dust defiled lay side by side."
19196,BOOK XXIII.,"And now, arising to a third essay,"
19197,BOOK XXIII.,"They should have wrestled yet again, had not915"
19198,BOOK XXIII.,"Achilles, interfering, them restrain’d."
19199,BOOK XXIII.,Strive not together more; cease to exhaust
19200,BOOK XXIII.,Each other’s force; ye both have earn’d the prize
19201,BOOK XXIII.,"Depart alike requited, and give place"
19202,BOOK XXIII.,To other Grecians who shall next contend.920
19203,BOOK XXIII.,"He spake; they glad complied, and wiping off"
19204,BOOK XXIII.,"The dust, put on their tunics. Then again"
19205,BOOK XXIII.,"Achilles other prizes yet proposed,"
19206,BOOK XXIII.,"The rapid runner’s meed. First, he produced"
19207,BOOK XXIII.,A silver goblet of six measures; earth925
19208,BOOK XXIII.,Own’d not its like for elegance of form.
19209,BOOK XXIII.,Skilful Sidonian artists had around
19210,BOOK XXIII.,"Embellish’d it,[22] and o’er the sable deep"
19211,BOOK XXIII.,Phœnician merchants into Lemnos’ port
19212,BOOK XXIII.,"Had borne it, and the boon to Thoas[23] given;930"
19213,BOOK XXIII.,"But Jason’s son, Euneüs, in exchange"
19214,BOOK XXIII.,"For Priam’s son Lycaon, to the hand"
19215,BOOK XXIII.,Had pass’d it of Patroclus famed in arms.
19216,BOOK XXIII.,"Achilles this, in honor of his friend,"
19217,BOOK XXIII.,"Set forth, the swiftest runner’s recompense.935"
19218,BOOK XXIII.,The second should a fatted ox receive
19219,BOOK XXIII.,"Of largest size, and he assign’d of gold"
19220,BOOK XXIII.,A just half-talent to the worst and last.
19221,BOOK XXIII.,"He stood erect, and to the Greeks he cried."
19222,BOOK XXIII.,Now stand ye forth who shall this prize dispute.940
19223,BOOK XXIII.,"He said, and at his word instant arose"
19224,BOOK XXIII.,Swift Ajax Oïliades; upsprang
19225,BOOK XXIII.,"The shrewd Ulysses next, and after him"
19226,BOOK XXIII.,"Brave Nestor’s son Antilochus, with whom"
19227,BOOK XXIII.,None vied in speed of all the youths of Greece.945
19228,BOOK XXIII.,They stood prepared. Achilles show’d the goal.
19229,BOOK XXIII.,At once all started. Oïliades
19230,BOOK XXIII.,"Led swift the course, and closely at his heels"
19231,BOOK XXIII.,Ulysses ran. Near as some cinctured maid
19232,BOOK XXIII.,"Industrious holds the distaff to her breast,950"
19233,BOOK XXIII.,While to and fro with practised finger neat
19234,BOOK XXIII.,"She tends the flax drawing it to a thread,"
19235,BOOK XXIII.,"So near Ulysses follow’d him, and press’d"
19236,BOOK XXIII.,"His footsteps, ere the dust fill’d them again,"
19237,BOOK XXIII.,"Pouring his breath into his neck behind,955"
19238,BOOK XXIII.,And never slackening pace. His ardent thirst
19239,BOOK XXIII.,Of victory with universal shouts
19240,BOOK XXIII.,"All seconded, and, eager, bade him on."
19241,BOOK XXIII.,"And now the contest shortening to a close,"
19242,BOOK XXIII.,Ulysses his request silent and brief960
19243,BOOK XXIII.,To azure-eyed Minerva thus preferr’d.
19244,BOOK XXIII.,"Oh Goddess hear, prosper me in the race!"
19245,BOOK XXIII.,"Such was his prayer, with which Minerva pleased,"
19246,BOOK XXIII.,"Freshen’d his limbs, and made him light to run."
19247,BOOK XXIII.,"And now, when in one moment they should both965"
19248,BOOK XXIII.,"Have darted on the prize, then Ajax’ foot"
19249,BOOK XXIII.,"Sliding, he fell; for where the dung of beeves"
19250,BOOK XXIII.,"Slain by Achilles for his friend, had spread"
19251,BOOK XXIII.,"The soil, there[24] Pallas tripp’d him. Ordure foul"
19252,BOOK XXIII.,"His mouth, and ordure foul his nostrils fill’d.970"
19253,BOOK XXIII.,"Then brave Ulysses, first arriving, seized"
19254,BOOK XXIII.,"The cup, and Ajax took his prize, the ox."
19255,BOOK XXIII.,"He grasp’d his horn, and sputtering as he stood"
19256,BOOK XXIII.,"The ordure forth, the Argives thus bespake."
19257,BOOK XXIII.,Ah—Pallas tripp’d my footsteps; she attends975
19258,BOOK XXIII.,Ulysses ever with a mother’s care.
19259,BOOK XXIII.,"Loud laugh’d the Grecians. Then, the remnant prize"
19260,BOOK XXIII.,"Antilochus receiving, smiled and said."
19261,BOOK XXIII.,"Ye need not, fellow-warriors, to be taught"
19262,BOOK XXIII.,"That now, as ever, the immortal Gods980"
19263,BOOK XXIII.,Honor on seniority bestow.
19264,BOOK XXIII.,"Ajax is elder, yet not much, than I."
19265,BOOK XXIII.,But Laertiades was born in times
19266,BOOK XXIII.,"Long past, a chief coëval with our sires,"
19267,BOOK XXIII.,"Not young, but vigorous; and of the Greeks,985"
19268,BOOK XXIII.,Achilles may alone with him contend.
19269,BOOK XXIII.,"So saying, the merit of superior speed"
19270,BOOK XXIII.,"To Peleus’ son he gave, who thus replied."
19271,BOOK XXIII.,Antilochus! thy praise of me shall prove
19272,BOOK XXIII.,"Nor vain nor unproductive to thyself,990"
19273,BOOK XXIII.,For the half-talent doubled shall be thine.
19274,BOOK XXIII.,"He spake, and, doubling it, the talent placed"
19275,BOOK XXIII.,Whole in his hand. He glad the gift received.
19276,BOOK XXIII.,"Achilles, then Sarpedon’s arms produced,"
19277,BOOK XXIII.,"Stripp’d from him by Patroclus, his long spear,995"
19278,BOOK XXIII.,"Helmet and shield, which in the midst he placed."
19279,BOOK XXIII.,"He stood erect, and to the Greeks he cried."
19280,BOOK XXIII.,I call for two brave warriors arm’d to prove
19281,BOOK XXIII.,"Each other’s skill with weapons keen, this prize"
19282,BOOK XXIII.,"Disputing, next, in presence of us all.1000"
19283,BOOK XXIII.,Who first shall through his armor reach the skin
19284,BOOK XXIII.,"Of his antagonist, and shall draw his blood,"
19285,BOOK XXIII.,To him this silver-studded falchion bright
19286,BOOK XXIII.,"I give; the blade is Thracian, and of late"
19287,BOOK XXIII.,"Asteropæus wore it, whom I slew.1005"
19288,BOOK XXIII.,"These other arms shall be their common meed,"
19289,BOOK XXIII.,And I will banquet both within my tent.
19290,BOOK XXIII.,"He said, then Telamonian Ajax huge"
19291,BOOK XXIII.,"Arose, and opposite the son arose"
19292,BOOK XXIII.,"Of warlike Tydeus, Diomede the brave.1010"
19293,BOOK XXIII.,Apart from all the people each put on
19294,BOOK XXIII.,"His arms, then moved into the middle space,"
19295,BOOK XXIII.,"Lowering terrific, and on fire to fight."
19296,BOOK XXIII.,The host look’d on amazed. Approaching each
19297,BOOK XXIII.,"The other, thrice they sprang to the assault,1015"
19298,BOOK XXIII.,And thrice struck hand to hand. Ajax the shield
19299,BOOK XXIII.,"Pierced of his adversary, but the flesh"
19300,BOOK XXIII.,"Attain’d not, baffled by his mail within."
19301,BOOK XXIII.,"Then Tydeus’ son, sheer o’er the ample disk"
19302,BOOK XXIII.,"Of Ajax, thrust a lance home to his neck,1020"
19303,BOOK XXIII.,And the Achaians for the life appall’d
19304,BOOK XXIII.,"Of Ajax, bade them, ceasing, share the prize."
19305,BOOK XXIII.,But the huge falchion with its sheath and belt—
19306,BOOK XXIII.,Achilles them on Diomede bestow’d.
19307,BOOK XXIII.,"The hero, next, an iron clod produced1025"
19308,BOOK XXIII.,"Rough from the forge, and wont to task the might"
19309,BOOK XXIII.,"Of King Eëtion; but, when him he slew,"
19310,BOOK XXIII.,"Pelides, glorious chief, with other spoils"
19311,BOOK XXIII.,From Thebes convey’d it in his fleet to Troy.
19312,BOOK XXIII.,"He stood erect, and to the Greeks he cried.1030"
19313,BOOK XXIII.,Come forth who also shall this prize dispute!
19314,BOOK XXIII.,"How far soe’er remote the winner’s fields,"
19315,BOOK XXIII.,This lump shall serve his wants five circling years;
19316,BOOK XXIII.,"His shepherd shall not, or his plower, need"
19317,BOOK XXIII.,"In quest of iron seek the distant town,1035"
19318,BOOK XXIII.,But hence he shall himself their wants supply.[25]
19319,BOOK XXIII.,"Then Polypœtes brave in fight arose,"
19320,BOOK XXIII.,"Arose Leonteus also, godlike chief,"
19321,BOOK XXIII.,With Ajax son of Telamon. Each took
19322,BOOK XXIII.,"His station, and Epeüs seized the clod.1040"
19323,BOOK XXIII.,"He swung, he cast it, and the Grecians laugh’d."
19324,BOOK XXIII.,"Leonteus, branch of Mars, quoited it next."
19325,BOOK XXIII.,Huge Telamonian Ajax with strong arm
19326,BOOK XXIII.,"Dismiss’d it third, and overpitch’d them both."
19327,BOOK XXIII.,But when brave Polypœtes seized the mass1045
19328,BOOK XXIII.,Far as the vigorous herdsman flings his staff
19329,BOOK XXIII.,"That twirling flies his numerous beeves between,[26]"
19330,BOOK XXIII.,"So far his cast outmeasured all beside,"
19331,BOOK XXIII.,And the host shouted. Then the friends arose
19332,BOOK XXIII.,"Of Polypœtes valiant chief, and bore1050"
19333,BOOK XXIII.,His ponderous acquisition to the ships.
19334,BOOK XXIII.,"The archers’ prize Achilles next proposed,"
19335,BOOK XXIII.,"Ten double and ten single axes, form’d"
19336,BOOK XXIII.,Of steel convertible to arrow-points.
19337,BOOK XXIII.,"He fix’d, far distant on the sands, the mast1055"
19338,BOOK XXIII.,"Of a brave bark cerulean-prow’d, to which"
19339,BOOK XXIII.,With small cord fasten’d by the foot he tied
19340,BOOK XXIII.,"A timorous dove, their mark at which to aim."
19341,BOOK XXIII.,"[27]Who strikes the dove, he conquers, and shall bear"
19342,BOOK XXIII.,These double axes all into his tent.1060
19343,BOOK XXIII.,"But who the cord alone, missing the bird,"
19344,BOOK XXIII.,"Successful less, he wins the single blades."
19345,BOOK XXIII.,"The might of royal Teucer then arose,"
19346,BOOK XXIII.,"And, fellow-warrior of the King of Crete,"
19347,BOOK XXIII.,Valiant Meriones. A brazen casque1065
19348,BOOK XXIII.,"Received the lots; they shook them, and the lot"
19349,BOOK XXIII.,"Fell first to Teucer. He, at once, a shaft"
19350,BOOK XXIII.,"Sent smartly forth, but vow’d not to the King[28]"
19351,BOOK XXIII.,"A hecatomb, all firstlings of the flock."
19352,BOOK XXIII.,He therefore (for Apollo greater praise1070
19353,BOOK XXIII.,"Denied him) miss’d the dove, but struck the cord"
19354,BOOK XXIII.,"That tied her, at small distance from the knot,"
19355,BOOK XXIII.,And with his arrow sever’d it. Upsprang
19356,BOOK XXIII.,"The bird into the air, and to the ground"
19357,BOOK XXIII.,Depending fell the cord. Shouts rent the skies.1075
19358,BOOK XXIII.,"Then, all in haste, Meriones the bow"
19359,BOOK XXIII.,Caught from his hand holding a shaft the while
19360,BOOK XXIII.,"Already aim’d, and to Apollo vow’d"
19361,BOOK XXIII.,"A hecatomb, all firstlings of the flock."
19362,BOOK XXIII.,"He eyed the dove aloft, under a cloud,1080"
19363,BOOK XXIII.,"And, while she wheel’d around, struck her beneath"
19364,BOOK XXIII.,The pinion; through her and beyond her pass’d
19365,BOOK XXIII.,"The arrow, and, returning, pierced the soil"
19366,BOOK XXIII.,Fast by the foot of brave Meriones.
19367,BOOK XXIII.,"She, perching on the mast again, her head1085"
19368,BOOK XXIII.,"Reclined, and hung her wide-unfolded wing,"
19369,BOOK XXIII.,"But, soon expiring, dropp’d and fell remote."
19370,BOOK XXIII.,Amazement seized the people. To his tent
19371,BOOK XXIII.,"Meriones the ten best axes bore,"
19372,BOOK XXIII.,And Teucer the inferior ten to his.[29]1090
19373,BOOK XXIII.,"Then, last, Achilles in the circus placed"
19374,BOOK XXIII.,"A ponderous spear and caldron yet unfired,"
19375,BOOK XXIII.,"Emboss’d with flowers around, its worth an ox."
19376,BOOK XXIII.,"Upstood the spear-expert; Atrides first,"
19377,BOOK XXIII.,"Wide-ruling Agamemnon, King of men,1095"
19378,BOOK XXIII.,"And next, brave fellow-warrior of the King"
19379,BOOK XXIII.,"Of Crete, Meriones; when thus his speech"
19380,BOOK XXIII.,Achilles to the royal chief address’d.
19381,BOOK XXIII.,Atrides! (for we know thy skill and force
19382,BOOK XXIII.,Matchless! that none can hurl the spear as thou)1100
19383,BOOK XXIII.,"This prize is thine, order it to thy ship;"
19384,BOOK XXIII.,"And if it please thee, as I would it might,"
19385,BOOK XXIII.,Let brave Meriones the spear receive.
19386,BOOK XXIII.,"He said; nor Agamemnon not complied,"
19387,BOOK XXIII.,But to Meriones the brazen spear
19388,BOOK XXIII.,"Presenting, to Talthybius gave in charge"
19389,BOOK XXIII.,"The caldron, next, his own illustrious prize."

19418,BOOK XXIV.,With difficulty on the perilous deep—
19419,BOOK XXIV.,Remembrance busily retracing themes
19420,BOOK XXIV.,"Like these, drew down his cheeks continual tears."
19421,BOOK XXIV.,"Now on his side he lay, now lay supine,"
19422,BOOK XXIV.,"Now prone, then starting from his couch he roam’d15"
19423,BOOK XXIV.,"Forlorn the beach, nor did the rising morn"
19424,BOOK XXIV.,"On seas and shores escape his watchful eye,"
19425,BOOK XXIV.,"But joining to his chariot his swift steeds,"

19427,BOOK XXIV.,Around the tomb of Menœtiades20
19428,BOOK XXIV.,"Him thrice he dragg’d; then rested in his tent,"
19429,BOOK XXIV.,Leaving him at his length stretch’d in the dust.

19439,BOOK XXIV.,"That counsel pleased the rest, but neither pleased"
19440,BOOK XXIV.,"Juno, nor Neptune, nor the blue-eyed maid."
19441,BOOK XXIV.,"They still, as at the first, held fast their hate"
19442,BOOK XXIV.,"Of sacred Troy, detested Priam still,"
19443,BOOK XXIV.,"And still his people, mindful of the crime35"

19445,BOOK XXIV.,"They came, those Goddesses affronting,[1] praise"
19446,BOOK XXIV.,And admiration gave to her alone
19447,BOOK XXIV.,Who with vile lusts his preference repaid.

19449,BOOK XXIV.,"Apollo, then, the immortals thus address’d."
19450,BOOK XXIV.,"Ye Gods, your dealings now injurious seem"

19453,BOOK XXIV.,"Whom now, though dead, ye cannot yet endure45"
19454,BOOK XXIV.,"To rescue, that Andromache once more"

19481,BOOK XXIV.,"And be it so; stand fast this word of thine,"
19482,BOOK XXIV.,God of the silver bow! if ye account
19483,BOOK XXIV.,Only such honor to Achilles due75
19484,BOOK XXIV.,As Hector claims; but Hector was by birth
19485,BOOK XXIV.,"Mere man, and suckled at a woman’s breast."
19486,BOOK XXIV.,"Not such Achilles; him a Goddess bore,"
19487,BOOK XXIV.,"Whom I myself nourish’d, and on my lap"

19491,BOOK XXIV.,"Partakers of the nuptial feast, and thou"
19492,BOOK XXIV.,"Wast present also with thine harp in hand,"
19493,BOOK XXIV.,Thou comrade of the vile! thou faithless ever!85
19494,BOOK XXIV.,Then answer thus cloud-gatherer Jove return’d.
19495,BOOK XXIV.,"Juno, forbear. Indulge not always wrath"
19496,BOOK XXIV.,"Against the Gods. They shall not share alike,"
19497,BOOK XXIV.,And in the same proportion our regards.
19498,BOOK XXIV.,Yet even Hector was the man in Troy90
19499,BOOK XXIV.,"Most favor’d by the Gods, and him no less"
19500,BOOK XXIV.,"I also loved, for punctual were his gifts"
19501,BOOK XXIV.,To us; mine altar never miss’d from him
19502,BOOK XXIV.,"Libation, or the steam of sacrifice,"
19503,BOOK XXIV.,The meed allotted to us from of old.95
19504,BOOK XXIV.,"But steal him not, since by Achilles’ eye"
19505,BOOK XXIV.,"Unseen ye cannot, who both day and night"
19506,BOOK XXIV.,"Watches[3] him, as a mother tends her son."
19507,BOOK XXIV.,"But call ye Thetis hither, I would give"
19508,BOOK XXIV.,"The Goddess counsel, that, at Priam’s hands100"
19509,BOOK XXIV.,"Accepting gifts, Achilles loose the dead."
19510,BOOK XXIV.,He ceased. Then Iris tempest-wing’d arose.
19511,BOOK XXIV.,"Samos between, and Imbrus rock-begirt,"
19512,BOOK XXIV.,She plunged into the gloomy flood; loud groan’d
19513,BOOK XXIV.,"The briny pool, while sudden down she rush’d,105"
19514,BOOK XXIV.,"As sinks the bull’s[4] horn with its leaden weight,"
19515,BOOK XXIV.,Death bearing to the raveners of the deep.
19516,BOOK XXIV.,Within her vaulted cave Thetis she found
19517,BOOK XXIV.,By every nymph of Ocean round about
19518,BOOK XXIV.,"Encompass’d; she, amid them all, the fate110"
19519,BOOK XXIV.,Wept of her noble son ordain’d to death
19520,BOOK XXIV.,"At fertile Troy, from Phthia far remote."
19521,BOOK XXIV.,"Then, Iris, drawing near, her thus address’d."
19522,BOOK XXIV.,"Arise, O Thetis! Jove, the author dread"
19523,BOOK XXIV.,"Of everlasting counsels, calls for thee.115"
19524,BOOK XXIV.,To whom the Goddess of the silver feet.
19525,BOOK XXIV.,"Why calls the mighty Thunderer me? I fear,"
19526,BOOK XXIV.,"Oppress’d with countless sorrows as I am,"
19527,BOOK XXIV.,To mingle with the Gods. Yet I obey—
19528,BOOK XXIV.,No word of his can prove an empty sound.120
19529,BOOK XXIV.,"So saying, the Goddess took her sable veil"
19530,BOOK XXIV.,(Eye ne’er beheld a darker) and began
19531,BOOK XXIV.,"Her progress, by the storm-wing’d Iris led."
19532,BOOK XXIV.,On either hand the billows open’d wide
19533,BOOK XXIV.,"A pass before them; they, ascending soon125"
19534,BOOK XXIV.,"The shore, updarted swift into the skies."
19535,BOOK XXIV.,They found loud-voiced Saturnian Jove around
19536,BOOK XXIV.,Environ’d by the ever-blessed Gods
19537,BOOK XXIV.,Convened in full assembly; she beside
19538,BOOK XXIV.,Her Father Jove (Pallas retiring) sat.130
19539,BOOK XXIV.,"Then, Juno, with consolatory speech,"
19540,BOOK XXIV.,"Presented to her hand a golden cup,"
19541,BOOK XXIV.,"Of which she drank, then gave it back again,"
19542,BOOK XXIV.,And thus the sire of Gods and men began.
19543,BOOK XXIV.,"Goddess of ocean, Thetis! thou hast sought135"
19544,BOOK XXIV.,"Olympus, bearing in thy bosom grief"
19545,BOOK XXIV.,"Never to be assuaged, as well I know."
19546,BOOK XXIV.,"Yet shalt thou learn, afflicted as thou art,"
19547,BOOK XXIV.,"Why I have summon’d thee. Nine days the Gods,"
19548,BOOK XXIV.,Concerning Hector’s body and thy own140
19549,BOOK XXIV.,"Brave city-spoiler son, have held dispute,"
19550,BOOK XXIV.,And some have urged ofttimes the Argicide
19551,BOOK XXIV.,"Keen-sighted Mercury, to steal the dead."
19552,BOOK XXIV.,"But I forbade it for Achilles’ sake,"
19553,BOOK XXIV.,"Whom I exalt, the better to insure145"
19554,BOOK XXIV.,Thy reverence and thy friendship evermore.
19555,BOOK XXIV.,"Haste, therefore, seek thy son, and tell him thus,"
19556,BOOK XXIV.,"The Gods resent it, say (but most of all"
19557,BOOK XXIV.,Myself am angry) that he still detains
19558,BOOK XXIV.,"Amid his fleet, through fury of revenge,150"
19559,BOOK XXIV.,"Unransom’d Hector; so shall he, at length,"
19560,BOOK XXIV.,"Through fear of me, perchance, release the slain."
19561,BOOK XXIV.,"Myself to generous Priam will, the while,"
19562,BOOK XXIV.,"Send Iris, who shall bid him to the fleet"
19563,BOOK XXIV.,"Of Greece, such ransom bearing as may soothe155"
19564,BOOK XXIV.,"Achilles, for redemption of his son."
19565,BOOK XXIV.,"So spake the God, nor Thetis not complied."
19566,BOOK XXIV.,Descending swift from the Olympian heights
19567,BOOK XXIV.,She reach’d Achilles’ tent. Him there she found
19568,BOOK XXIV.,"Groaning disconsolate, while others ran160"
19569,BOOK XXIV.,"To and fro, occupied around a sheep"
19570,BOOK XXIV.,"New-slaughter’d, large, and of exuberant fleece."
19571,BOOK XXIV.,"She, sitting close beside him, softly strok’d"
19572,BOOK XXIV.,"His cheek, and thus, affectionate, began."
19573,BOOK XXIV.,"How long, my son! sorrowing and mourning here,165"
19574,BOOK XXIV.,"Wilt thou consume thy soul, nor give one thought"
19575,BOOK XXIV.,"Either to food or love? Yet love is good,"
19576,BOOK XXIV.,And woman grief’s best cure; for length of days
19577,BOOK XXIV.,"Is not thy doom, but, even now, thy death"
19578,BOOK XXIV.,And ruthless destiny are on the wing.170
19579,BOOK XXIV.,"Mark me,—I come a lieger sent from Jove."
19580,BOOK XXIV.,"The Gods, he saith, resent it, but himself"
19581,BOOK XXIV.,"More deeply than the rest, that thou detain’st"
19582,BOOK XXIV.,"Amid thy fleet, through fury of revenge,"
19583,BOOK XXIV.,"Unransom’d Hector. Be advised, accept175"
19584,BOOK XXIV.,"Ransom, and to his friends resign the dead."
19585,BOOK XXIV.,"To whom Achilles, swiftest of the swift."
19586,BOOK XXIV.,"Come then the ransomer, and take him hence;"
19587,BOOK XXIV.,"If Jove himself command it,—be it so."
19588,BOOK XXIV.,"So they, among the ships, conferring sat180"
19589,BOOK XXIV.,"On various themes, the Goddess and her son;"
19590,BOOK XXIV.,Meantime Saturnian Jove commanded down
19591,BOOK XXIV.,His swift ambassadress to sacred Troy.
19592,BOOK XXIV.,"Hence, rapid Iris! leave the Olympian heights."
19593,BOOK XXIV.,"And, finding noble Priam, bid him haste185"
19594,BOOK XXIV.,"Into Achaia’s fleet, bearing such gifts"
19595,BOOK XXIV.,"As may assuage Achilles, and prevail"
19596,BOOK XXIV.,To liberate the body of his son.
19597,BOOK XXIV.,"Alone, he must; no Trojan of them all"
19598,BOOK XXIV.,"May company the senior thither, save190"
19599,BOOK XXIV.,An ancient herald to direct his mules

19606,BOOK XXIV.,"Nor will himself Achilles slay him there,"

19609,BOOK XXIV.,"Nor heedless, no—nor wilful to offend,"
19610,BOOK XXIV.,But will his suppliant with much grace receive.[5]
19611,BOOK XXIV.,
19612,BOOK XXIV.,"He ceased; then Iris tempest-wing’d arose,"
19613,BOOK XXIV.,"Jove’s messenger, and, at the gates arrived"

19619,BOOK XXIV.,"Much dust was spread, which, rolling on the earth,210"
19620,BOOK XXIV.,He had shower’d on them with unsparing hands.
19621,BOOK XXIV.,"The palace echoed to his daughters’ cries,"
19622,BOOK XXIV.,And to the cries of matrons calling fresh

19636,BOOK XXIV.,"Alone, thou must; no Trojan of them all"
19637,BOOK XXIV.,"Hath leave to attend thy journey thither, save"
19638,BOOK XXIV.,An ancient herald to direct thy mules

19650,BOOK XXIV.,
19651,BOOK XXIV.,"So spake the swift ambassadress, and went."
19652,BOOK XXIV.,"Then, calling to his sons, he bade them bring"
19653,BOOK XXIV.,"His litter forth, and bind the coffer on,"
19654,BOOK XXIV.,While to his fragrant chamber he repair’d
19655,BOOK XXIV.,"Himself, with cedar lined and lofty-roof’d,245"
19656,BOOK XXIV.,A treasury of wonders into which
19657,BOOK XXIV.,"The Queen he summon’d, whom he thus bespake."
19658,BOOK XXIV.,Hecuba! the ambassadress of Jove
19659,BOOK XXIV.,"Hath come, who bids me to the Grecian fleet,"
19660,BOOK XXIV.,Bearing such presents thither as may soothe250
19661,BOOK XXIV.,"Achilles, for redemption of my son."
19662,BOOK XXIV.,"But say, what seems this enterprise to thee?"
19663,BOOK XXIV.,"Myself am much inclined to it, I feel"
19664,BOOK XXIV.,My courage prompting me amain toward
19665,BOOK XXIV.,"The fleet, and into the Achaian camp.255"
19666,BOOK XXIV.,"Then wept the Queen aloud, and thus replied."
19667,BOOK XXIV.,"Ah! whither is thy wisdom fled, for which"

19671,BOOK XXIV.,"His face, by whom so many valiant sons"

19673,BOOK XXIV.,For should that savage man and faithless once
19674,BOOK XXIV.,"Seize and discover thee, no pity expect"
19675,BOOK XXIV.,Or reverence at his hands. Come—let us weep265
19676,BOOK XXIV.,"Together, here sequester’d; for the thread"
19677,BOOK XXIV.,Spun for him by his destiny severe
19678,BOOK XXIV.,"When he was born, ordain’d our son remote"

19681,BOOK XXIV.,"How I could tear him with my teeth! His deeds,"
19682,BOOK XXIV.,"Disgraceful to my son, then should not want"
19683,BOOK XXIV.,Retaliation; for he slew not him
19684,BOOK XXIV.,"Skulking, but standing boldly for the wives,"
19685,BOOK XXIV.,"The daughters fair, and citizens of Troy,275"
19686,BOOK XXIV.,"Guiltless of flight,[6] and of the wish to fly."
19687,BOOK XXIV.,
19688,BOOK XXIV.,"Whom godlike Priam answer’d, ancient King."
19689,BOOK XXIV.,"Impede me not who willing am to go,"
19690,BOOK XXIV.,"Nor be, thyself, a bird of ominous note"
19691,BOOK XXIV.,"To terrify me under my own roof,280"
19692,BOOK XXIV.,For thou shalt not prevail. Had mortal man
19693,BOOK XXIV.,"Enjoin’d me this attempt, prophet, or priest,"
19694,BOOK XXIV.,"Or soothsayer, I had pronounced him false"
19695,BOOK XXIV.,"And fear’d it but the more. But, since I saw"
19696,BOOK XXIV.,"The Goddess with these eyes, and heard, myself,285"
19697,BOOK XXIV.,"The voice divine, I go; that word shall stand;"
19698,BOOK XXIV.,"And, if my doom be in the fleet of Greece"
19699,BOOK XXIV.,"To perish, be it so; Achilles’ arm"
19700,BOOK XXIV.,"Shall give me speedy death, and I shall die"
19701,BOOK XXIV.,"Folding my son, and satisfied with tears.290"
19702,BOOK XXIV.,"So saying, he open’d wide the elegant lids"
19703,BOOK XXIV.,"Of numerous chests, whence mantles twelve he took"
19704,BOOK XXIV.,Of texture beautiful; twelve single cloaks;
19705,BOOK XXIV.,"As many carpets, with as many robes,"
19706,BOOK XXIV.,"To which he added vests, an equal store.295"
19707,BOOK XXIV.,"He also took ten talents forth of gold,"
19708,BOOK XXIV.,"All weigh’d, two splendid tripods, caldrons four,"
19709,BOOK XXIV.,And after these a cup of matchless worth
19710,BOOK XXIV.,Given to him when ambassador in Thrace;
19711,BOOK XXIV.,"A noble gift, which yet the hoary King300"
19712,BOOK XXIV.,"Spared not, such fervor of desire he felt"
19713,BOOK XXIV.,"To loose his son. Then from his portico,"
19714,BOOK XXIV.,With angry taunts he drove the gather’d crowds.
19715,BOOK XXIV.,"Away! away! ye dregs of earth, away!"
19716,BOOK XXIV.,Ye shame of human kind! Have ye no griefs305
19717,BOOK XXIV.,"At home, that ye come hither troubling _me_?"
19718,BOOK XXIV.,Deem ye it little that Saturnian Jove
19719,BOOK XXIV.,"Afflicts me thus, and of my very best,"
19720,BOOK XXIV.,Best boy deprives me? Ah! ye shall be taught
19721,BOOK XXIV.,"Yourselves that loss, far easier to be slain310"
19722,BOOK XXIV.,"By the Achaians now, since he is dead."
19723,BOOK XXIV.,"But I, ere yet the city I behold"
19724,BOOK XXIV.,"Taken and pillaged, with these aged eyes,"
19725,BOOK XXIV.,Shall find safe hiding in the shades below.
19726,BOOK XXIV.,
19727,BOOK XXIV.,"He said, and chased them with his staff; they left315"
19728,BOOK XXIV.,"In haste the doors, by the old King expell’d."
19729,BOOK XXIV.,"Then, chiding them aloud, his sons he call’d,"
19730,BOOK XXIV.,"Helenus, Paris, noble Agathon,"
19731,BOOK XXIV.,"Pammon, Antiphonus, and bold in fight"
19732,BOOK XXIV.,"Polites, Dios of illustrious fame,320"
19733,BOOK XXIV.,Hippothoüs and Deiphobus—all nine
19734,BOOK XXIV.,"He call’d, thus issuing, angry, his commands."
19735,BOOK XXIV.,"Quick! quick! ye slothful in your father’s cause,"
19736,BOOK XXIV.,Ye worthless brood! would that in Hector’s stead
19737,BOOK XXIV.,Ye all had perish’d in the fleet of Greece!325
19738,BOOK XXIV.,Oh altogether wretched! in all Troy
19739,BOOK XXIV.,"No man had sons to boast valiant as mine,"
19740,BOOK XXIV.,And I have lost them all. Mestor is gone
19741,BOOK XXIV.,"The godlike, Troilus the steed-renown’d,"
19742,BOOK XXIV.,"And Hector, who with other men compared330"
19743,BOOK XXIV.,"Seem’d a Divinity, whom none had deem’d"
19744,BOOK XXIV.,"From mortal man derived, but from a God."
19745,BOOK XXIV.,"These Mars hath taken, and hath left me none"
19746,BOOK XXIV.,"But scandals of my house, void of all truth,"
19747,BOOK XXIV.,"Dancers, exact step-measurers,[7] a band335"
19748,BOOK XXIV.,"Of public robbers, thieves of kids and lambs."
19749,BOOK XXIV.,Will ye not bring my litter to the gate
19750,BOOK XXIV.,"This moment, and with all this package quick"
19751,BOOK XXIV.,"Charge it, that we may hence without delay?"
19752,BOOK XXIV.,"He said, and by his chiding awed, his sons340"
19753,BOOK XXIV.,"Drew forth the royal litter, neat, new-built,"
19754,BOOK XXIV.,"And following swift the draught, on which they bound"
19755,BOOK XXIV.,"The coffer; next, they lower’d from the wall"
19756,BOOK XXIV.,The sculptured boxen yoke with its two rings;[8]
19757,BOOK XXIV.,"And with the yoke its furniture, in length345"
19758,BOOK XXIV.,Nine cubits; this to the extremest end
19759,BOOK XXIV.,"Adjusting of the pole, they cast the ring"
19760,BOOK XXIV.,"Over the ring-bolt; then, thrice through the yoke"
19761,BOOK XXIV.,"They drew the brace on both sides, made it fast"
19762,BOOK XXIV.,"With even knots, and tuck’d[9] the dangling ends.350"
19763,BOOK XXIV.,"Producing, next, the glorious ransom-price"
19764,BOOK XXIV.,"Of Hector’s body, on the litter’s floor"
19765,BOOK XXIV.,"They heap’d it all, then yoked the sturdy mules,"
19766,BOOK XXIV.,A gift illustrious by the Mysians erst
19767,BOOK XXIV.,"Conferr’d on Priam; to the chariot, last,355"
19768,BOOK XXIV.,"They led forth Priam’s steeds, which the old King"
19769,BOOK XXIV.,(In person serving them) with freshest corn
19770,BOOK XXIV.,"Constant supplied; meantime, himself within"
19771,BOOK XXIV.,"The palace, and his herald, were employ’d"
19772,BOOK XXIV.,"Girding[10] themselves, to go; wise each and good.360"
19773,BOOK XXIV.,"And now came mournful Hecuba, with wine"
19774,BOOK XXIV.,"Delicious charged, which in a golden cup"
19775,BOOK XXIV.,"She brought, that not without libation due"
19776,BOOK XXIV.,"First made, they might depart. Before the steeds"
19777,BOOK XXIV.,"Her steps she stay’d, and Priam thus address’d.365"
19778,BOOK XXIV.,"Take this, and to the Sire of all perform"
19779,BOOK XXIV.,"Libation, praying him a safe return"
19780,BOOK XXIV.,"From hostile hands, since thou art urged to seek"
19781,BOOK XXIV.,"The Grecian camp, though not by my desire."
19782,BOOK XXIV.,"Pray also to Idæan Jove cloud-girt,370"
19783,BOOK XXIV.,"Who oversees all Ilium, that he send"
19784,BOOK XXIV.,"His messenger or ere thou go, the bird"
19785,BOOK XXIV.,"His favorite most, surpassing all in strength,"
19786,BOOK XXIV.,"At thy right hand; him seeing, thou shalt tend"
19787,BOOK XXIV.,With better hope toward the fleet of Greece.375
19788,BOOK XXIV.,But should loud-thundering Jove his lieger swift
19789,BOOK XXIV.,"Withhold, from me far be it to advise"
19790,BOOK XXIV.,"This journey, howsoe’er thou wish to go."
19791,BOOK XXIV.,To whom the godlike Priam thus replied.
19792,BOOK XXIV.,"This exhortation will I not refuse,380"
19793,BOOK XXIV.,"O Queen! for, lifting to the Gods his hands"
19794,BOOK XXIV.,"In prayer for their compassion, none can err."
19795,BOOK XXIV.,"So saying, he bade the maiden o’er the rest,"
19796,BOOK XXIV.,"Chief in authority, pour on his hands"
19797,BOOK XXIV.,"Pure water, for the maiden at his side385"
19798,BOOK XXIV.,"With ewer charged and laver, stood prepared."
19799,BOOK XXIV.,"He laved his hands; then, taking from the Queen"
19800,BOOK XXIV.,"The goblet, in his middle area stood"
19801,BOOK XXIV.,Pouring libation with his eyes upturn’d
19802,BOOK XXIV.,"Heaven-ward devout, and thus his prayer preferr’d.390"
19803,BOOK XXIV.,"Jove, great and glorious above all, who rulest,"
19804,BOOK XXIV.,"On Ida’s summit seated, all below!"
19805,BOOK XXIV.,Grant me arrived within Achilles’ tent
19806,BOOK XXIV.,"Kindness to meet and pity, and oh send"
19807,BOOK XXIV.,"Thy messenger or ere I go, the bird395"
19808,BOOK XXIV.,"Thy favorite most, surpassing all in strength,"
19809,BOOK XXIV.,"At my right hand, which seeing, I shall tend"
19810,BOOK XXIV.,With better hope toward the fleet of Greece.
19811,BOOK XXIV.,"He ended, at whose prayer, incontinent,"
19812,BOOK XXIV.,"Jove sent his eagle, surest of all signs,400"
19813,BOOK XXIV.,"The black-plumed bird voracious, Morphnos[11] named,"
19814,BOOK XXIV.,And Percnos.[11] Wide as the well-guarded door
19815,BOOK XXIV.,Of some rich potentate his vans he spread
19816,BOOK XXIV.,"On either side; they saw him on the right,"
19817,BOOK XXIV.,Skimming the towers of Troy; glad they beheld405
19818,BOOK XXIV.,"That omen, and all felt their hearts consoled."
19819,BOOK XXIV.,"Delay’d not then the hoary King, but quick"
19820,BOOK XXIV.,"Ascending to his seat, his coursers urged"
19821,BOOK XXIV.,Through vestibule and sounding porch abroad.
19822,BOOK XXIV.,"The four-wheel’d litter led, drawn by the mules410"
19823,BOOK XXIV.,"Which sage Idæus managed, behind whom"
19824,BOOK XXIV.,"Went Priam, plying with the scourge his steeds"
19825,BOOK XXIV.,"Continual through the town, while all his friends,"
19826,BOOK XXIV.,"Following their sovereign with dejected hearts,"
19827,BOOK XXIV.,Lamented him as going to his death.415
19828,BOOK XXIV.,But when from Ilium’s gate into the plain
19829,BOOK XXIV.,"They had descended, then the sons-in-law"
19830,BOOK XXIV.,"Of Priam, and his sons, to Troy return’d."
19831,BOOK XXIV.,"Nor they, now traversing the plain, the note"
19832,BOOK XXIV.,Escaped of Jove the Thunderer; he beheld420
19833,BOOK XXIV.,"Compassionate the venerable King,"
19834,BOOK XXIV.,And thus his own son Mercury bespake.
19835,BOOK XXIV.,Mercury! (for above all others thou
19836,BOOK XXIV.,Delightest to associate with mankind
19837,BOOK XXIV.,"Familiar, whom thou wilt winning with ease425"
19838,BOOK XXIV.,"To converse free) go thou, and so conduct"
19839,BOOK XXIV.,"Priam into the Grecian camp, that none"
19840,BOOK XXIV.,Of all the numerous Danaï may see
19841,BOOK XXIV.,"Or mark him, till he reach Achilles’ tent."
19842,BOOK XXIV.,"He spake, nor the ambassador of heaven430"
19843,BOOK XXIV.,"The Argicide delay’d, but bound in haste"
19844,BOOK XXIV.,"His undecaying sandals to his feet,"
19845,BOOK XXIV.,"Golden, divine, which waft him o’er the floods"
19846,BOOK XXIV.,"Swift as the wind, and o’er the boundless earth."
19847,BOOK XXIV.,He took his rod with which he charms to sleep435
19848,BOOK XXIV.,"All eyes, and theirs who sleep opens again."
19849,BOOK XXIV.,"Arm’d with that rod, forth flew the Argicide."
19850,BOOK XXIV.,At Ilium and the Hellespontic shores
19851,BOOK XXIV.,"Arriving sudden, a king’s son he seem’d,"
19852,BOOK XXIV.,"Now clothing first his ruddy cheek with down,440"
19853,BOOK XXIV.,"Which is youth’s loveliest season; so disguised,"
19854,BOOK XXIV.,His progress he began. They now (the tomb
19855,BOOK XXIV.,Magnificent of Ilus past) beside
19856,BOOK XXIV.,"The river stay’d the mules and steeds to drink,"
19857,BOOK XXIV.,For twilight dimm’d the fields. Idæus first445
19858,BOOK XXIV.,"Perceived him near, and Priam thus bespake."
19859,BOOK XXIV.,"Think, son of Dardanus! for we have need"
19860,BOOK XXIV.,"Of our best thought. I see a warrior. Now,"
19861,BOOK XXIV.,Now we shall die; I know it. Turn we quick
19862,BOOK XXIV.,Our steeds to flight; or let us clasp his knees450
19863,BOOK XXIV.,And his compassion suppliant essay.
19864,BOOK XXIV.,Terror and consternation at that sound
19865,BOOK XXIV.,The mind of Priam felt; erect the hair
19866,BOOK XXIV.,"Bristled his limbs, and with amaze he stood"
19867,BOOK XXIV.,"Motionless. But the God, meantime, approach’d,455"
19868,BOOK XXIV.,"And, seizing ancient Priam’s hand, inquired."
19869,BOOK XXIV.,"Whither, my father! in the dewy night"
19870,BOOK XXIV.,"Drivest thou thy mules and steeds, while others sleep?"
19871,BOOK XXIV.,"And fear’st thou not the fiery host of Greece,"
19872,BOOK XXIV.,"Thy foes implacable, so nigh at hand?460"
19873,BOOK XXIV.,"Of whom should any, through the shadow dun"
19874,BOOK XXIV.,"Of flitting night, discern thee bearing forth"
19875,BOOK XXIV.,"So rich a charge, then what wouldst thou expect?"
19876,BOOK XXIV.,"Thou art not young thyself, nor with the aid"
19877,BOOK XXIV.,"Of this thine ancient servant, strong enough465"
19878,BOOK XXIV.,"Force to repulse, should any threaten force."
19879,BOOK XXIV.,But injury fear none or harm from me;
19880,BOOK XXIV.,I rather much from harm by other hands
19881,BOOK XXIV.,"Would save thee, thou resemblest so my sire."
19882,BOOK XXIV.,"Whom answer’d godlike Priam, hoar with age.470"
19883,BOOK XXIV.,My son! well spoken. Thou hast judged aright.
19884,BOOK XXIV.,Yet even me some Deity protects
19885,BOOK XXIV.,Thus far; to whom I owe it that I meet
19886,BOOK XXIV.,"So seasonably one like thee, in form"
19887,BOOK XXIV.,"So admirable, and in mind discreet475"
19888,BOOK XXIV.,"As thou art beautiful. Blest parents, thine!"
19889,BOOK XXIV.,"To whom the messenger of heaven again,"
19890,BOOK XXIV.,The Argicide. Oh ancient and revered!
19891,BOOK XXIV.,"Thou hast well spoken all. Yet this declare,"
19892,BOOK XXIV.,And with sincerity; bear’st thou away480
19893,BOOK XXIV.,"Into some foreign country, for the sake"
19894,BOOK XXIV.,"Of safer custody, this precious charge?"
19895,BOOK XXIV.,"Or, urged by fear, forsake ye all alike"
19896,BOOK XXIV.,"Troy’s sacred towers! since he whom thou hast lost,"
19897,BOOK XXIV.,"Thy noble son, was of excelling worth485"
19898,BOOK XXIV.,"In arms, and nought inferior to the Greeks."
19899,BOOK XXIV.,"Then thus the godlike Priam, hoary King."
19900,BOOK XXIV.,"But tell me first who _Thou_ art, and from whom"
19901,BOOK XXIV.,"Descended, loveliest youth! who hast the fate"
19902,BOOK XXIV.,So well of my unhappy son rehearsed?490
19903,BOOK XXIV.,To whom the herald Mercury replied.
19904,BOOK XXIV.,"Thy questions, venerable sire! proposed"
19905,BOOK XXIV.,"Concerning noble Hector, are design’d"
19906,BOOK XXIV.,"To prove me. Him, not seldom, with these eyes"
19907,BOOK XXIV.,In man-ennobling fight I have beheld495
19908,BOOK XXIV.,Most active; saw him when he thinn’d the Greeks
19909,BOOK XXIV.,"With his sharp spear, and drove them to the ships."
19910,BOOK XXIV.,"Amazed we stood to notice him; for us,"
19911,BOOK XXIV.,"Incensed against the ruler of our host,"
19912,BOOK XXIV.,Achilles suffer’d not to share the fight.500
19913,BOOK XXIV.,I serve Achilles; the same gallant bark
19914,BOOK XXIV.,"Brought us, and of the Myrmidons am I,"
19915,BOOK XXIV.,"Son of Polyctor; wealthy is my sire,"
19916,BOOK XXIV.,"And such in years as thou; six sons he hath,"
19917,BOOK XXIV.,"Beside myself the seventh, and (the lots cast505"
19918,BOOK XXIV.,Among us all) mine sent me to the wars.
19919,BOOK XXIV.,"That I have left the ships, seeking the plain,"
19920,BOOK XXIV.,"The cause is this; the Greeks, at break of day,"
19921,BOOK XXIV.,"Will compass, arm’d, the city, for they loathe"
19922,BOOK XXIV.,"To sit inactive, neither can the chiefs510"
19923,BOOK XXIV.,Restrain the hot impatience of the host.
19924,BOOK XXIV.,Then godlike Priam answer thus return’d.
19925,BOOK XXIV.,"If of the band thou be of Peleus’ son,"
19926,BOOK XXIV.,"Achilles, tell me undisguised the truth."
19927,BOOK XXIV.,"My son, subsists he still, or hath thy chief515"
19928,BOOK XXIV.,Limb after limb given him to his dogs?
19929,BOOK XXIV.,Him answer’d then the herald of the skies.
19930,BOOK XXIV.,Oh venerable sir! him neither dogs
19931,BOOK XXIV.,"Have eaten yet, nor fowls, but at the ships"
19932,BOOK XXIV.,"His body, and within Achilles’ tent520"
19933,BOOK XXIV.,Neglected lies. Twelve days he so hath lain;
19934,BOOK XXIV.,Yet neither worm which diets on the brave
19935,BOOK XXIV.,"In battle fallen, hath eaten him, or taint"
19936,BOOK XXIV.,Invaded. He around Patroclus’ tomb
19937,BOOK XXIV.,"Drags him indeed pitiless, oft as day525"
19938,BOOK XXIV.,"Reddens the east, yet safe from blemish still"
19939,BOOK XXIV.,"His corse remains. Thou wouldst, thyself, admire"
19940,BOOK XXIV.,"Seeing how fresh the dew-drops, as he lies,"
19941,BOOK XXIV.,"Rest on him, and his blood is cleansed away"
19942,BOOK XXIV.,That not a stain is left. Even his wounds530
19943,BOOK XXIV.,"(For many a wound they gave him) all are closed,"
19944,BOOK XXIV.,"Such care the blessed Gods have of thy son,"
19945,BOOK XXIV.,"Dead as he is, whom living much they loved."
19946,BOOK XXIV.,"So he; then, glad, the ancient King replied."
19947,BOOK XXIV.,"Good is it, oh my son! to yield the Gods535"
19948,BOOK XXIV.,"Their just demands. My boy, while yet he lived,"
19949,BOOK XXIV.,Lived not unmindful of the worship due
19950,BOOK XXIV.,"To the Olympian powers, who, therefore, him"
19951,BOOK XXIV.,"Remember, even in the bands of death."
19952,BOOK XXIV.,Come then—this beauteous cup take at my hand—540
19953,BOOK XXIV.,"Be thou my guard, and, if the Gods permit,"
19954,BOOK XXIV.,"My guide, till to Achilles’ tent I come."
19955,BOOK XXIV.,Whom answer’d then the messenger of heaven.
19956,BOOK XXIV.,"Sir! thou perceivest me young, and art disposed"
19957,BOOK XXIV.,To try my virtue; but it shall not fail.545
19958,BOOK XXIV.,"Thou bidd’st me at thine hand a gift accept,"
19959,BOOK XXIV.,Whereof Achilles knows not; but I fear
19960,BOOK XXIV.,"Achilles, and on no account should dare"
19961,BOOK XXIV.,"Defraud him, lest some evil find me next."
19962,BOOK XXIV.,But thee I would with pleasure hence conduct550
19963,BOOK XXIV.,"Even to glorious Argos, over sea"
19964,BOOK XXIV.,"Or over land, nor any, through contempt"
19965,BOOK XXIV.,"Of such a guard, should dare to do thee wrong."
19966,BOOK XXIV.,"So Mercury, and to the chariot seat"
19967,BOOK XXIV.,"Upspringing, seized at once the lash and reins,555"
19968,BOOK XXIV.,And with fresh vigor mules and steeds inspired.
19969,BOOK XXIV.,"Arriving at the foss and towers, they found"
19970,BOOK XXIV.,"The guard preparing now their evening cheer,"
19971,BOOK XXIV.,All whom the Argicide with sudden sleep
19972,BOOK XXIV.,"Oppress’d, then oped the gates, thrust back the bars,560"
19973,BOOK XXIV.,"And introduced, with all his litter-load"
19974,BOOK XXIV.,"Of costly gifts, the venerable King."
19975,BOOK XXIV.,But when they reached the tent for Peleus’ son
19976,BOOK XXIV.,Raised by the Myrmidons (with trunks of pine
19977,BOOK XXIV.,"They built it, lopping smooth the boughs away,555"
19978,BOOK XXIV.,Then spread with shaggy mowings of the mead
19979,BOOK XXIV.,"Its lofty roof, and with a spacious court"
19980,BOOK XXIV.,"Surrounded it, all fenced with driven stakes;"
19981,BOOK XXIV.,"One bar alone of pine secured the door,"
19982,BOOK XXIV.,Which ask’d three Grecians with united force570
19983,BOOK XXIV.,"To thrust it to its place, and three again"
19984,BOOK XXIV.,"To thrust it back, although Achilles oft"
19985,BOOK XXIV.,Would heave it to the door himself alone;)
19986,BOOK XXIV.,"Then Hermes, benefactor of mankind,"
19987,BOOK XXIV.,"That bar displacing for the King of Troy,575"
19988,BOOK XXIV.,Gave entrance to himself and to his gifts
19989,BOOK XXIV.,"For Peleus’ son design’d, and from the seat"
19990,BOOK XXIV.,"Alighting, thus his speech to Priam turn’d."
19991,BOOK XXIV.,Oh ancient Priam! an immortal God
19992,BOOK XXIV.,"Attends thee; I am Hermes, by command580"
19993,BOOK XXIV.,Of Jove my father thy appointed guide.
19994,BOOK XXIV.,"But I return. I will not, entering here,"
19995,BOOK XXIV.,Stand in Achilles’ sight; immortal Powers
19996,BOOK XXIV.,May not so unreservedly indulge
19997,BOOK XXIV.,"Creatures of mortal kind. But enter thou,585"
19998,BOOK XXIV.,"Embrace his knees, and by his father both"
19999,BOOK XXIV.,"And by his Goddess mother sue to him,"
20000,BOOK XXIV.,"And by his son, that his whole heart may melt."
20001,BOOK XXIV.,"So Hermes spake, and to the skies again"
20002,BOOK XXIV.,"Ascended. Then leap’d Priam to the ground,590"
20003,BOOK XXIV.,"Leaving Idæus; he, the mules and steeds"
20004,BOOK XXIV.,"Watch’d, while the ancient King into the tent"
20005,BOOK XXIV.,Proceeded of Achilles dear to Jove.
20006,BOOK XXIV.,"Him there he found, and sitting found apart"
20007,BOOK XXIV.,"His fellow-warriors, of whom two alone595"
20008,BOOK XXIV.,"Served at his side, Alcimus, branch of Mars"
20009,BOOK XXIV.,And brave Automedon; he had himself
20010,BOOK XXIV.,"Supp’d newly, and the board stood unremoved."
20011,BOOK XXIV.,"Unseen of all huge Priam enter’d, stood"
20012,BOOK XXIV.,"Near to Achilles, clasp’d his knees, and kiss’d600"
20013,BOOK XXIV.,Those terrible and homicidal hands
20014,BOOK XXIV.,That had destroy’d so many of his sons.
20015,BOOK XXIV.,As when a fugitive for blood the house
20016,BOOK XXIV.,"Of some chief enters in a foreign land,"
20017,BOOK XXIV.,"All gaze, astonish’d at the sudden guest,605"
20018,BOOK XXIV.,"So gazed Achilles seeing Priam there,"
20019,BOOK XXIV.,"And so stood all astonish’d, each his eyes"
20020,BOOK XXIV.,In silence fastening on his fellow’s face.
20021,BOOK XXIV.,"But Priam kneel’d, and suppliant thus began."
20022,BOOK XXIV.,"Think, oh Achilles, semblance of the Gods!610"
20023,BOOK XXIV.,"On thy own father full of days like me,"
20024,BOOK XXIV.,And trembling on the gloomy verge of life.[12]
20025,BOOK XXIV.,"Some neighbor chief, it may be, even now"
20026,BOOK XXIV.,"Oppresses him, and there is none at hand,"
20027,BOOK XXIV.,No friend to suocor him in his distress.615
20028,BOOK XXIV.,"Yet, doubtless, hearing that Achilles lives,"
20029,BOOK XXIV.,"He still rejoices, hoping, day by day,"
20030,BOOK XXIV.,That one day he shall see the face again
20031,BOOK XXIV.,Of his own son from distant Troy return’d.
20032,BOOK XXIV.,"But me no comfort cheers, whose bravest sons,620"
20033,BOOK XXIV.,"So late the flower of Ilium, all are slain."
20034,BOOK XXIV.,"When Greece came hither, I had fifty sons;"
20035,BOOK XXIV.,"Nineteen were children of one bed, the rest"
20036,BOOK XXIV.,Born of my concubines. A numerous house!
20037,BOOK XXIV.,"But fiery Mars hath thinn’d it. One I had,625"
20038,BOOK XXIV.,"One, more than all my sons the strength of Troy,"
20039,BOOK XXIV.,Whom standing for his country thou hast slain—
20040,BOOK XXIV.,Hector—his body to redeem I come
20041,BOOK XXIV.,"Into Achaia’s fleet, bringing, myself,"
20042,BOOK XXIV.,Ransom inestimable to thy tent.630
20043,BOOK XXIV.,"Reverence the Gods, Achilles! recollect"
20044,BOOK XXIV.,Thy father; for his sake compassion show
20045,BOOK XXIV.,"To me more pitiable still, who draw"
20046,BOOK XXIV.,Home to my lips (humiliation yet
20047,BOOK XXIV.,Unseen on earth) his hand who slew my son.635
20048,BOOK XXIV.,"So saying, he waken’d in his soul regret"
20049,BOOK XXIV.,Of his own sire; softly he placed his hand
20050,BOOK XXIV.,"On Priam’s hand, and push’d him gently away."
20051,BOOK XXIV.,Remembrance melted both. Rolling before
20052,BOOK XXIV.,"Achilles’ feet, Priam his son deplored640"
20053,BOOK XXIV.,"Wide-slaughtering Hector, and Achilles wept"
20054,BOOK XXIV.,"By turns his father, and by turns his friend"
20055,BOOK XXIV.,Patroclus; sounds of sorrow fill’d the tent.
20056,BOOK XXIV.,"But when, at length satiate, Achilles felt"
20057,BOOK XXIV.,"His heart from grief, and all his frame relieved,645"
20058,BOOK XXIV.,"Upstarting from his seat, with pity moved"
20059,BOOK XXIV.,"Of Priam’s silver locks and silver beard,"
20060,BOOK XXIV.,"He raised the ancient father by his hand,"
20061,BOOK XXIV.,Whom in wing’d accents kind he thus bespake.
20062,BOOK XXIV.,Wretched indeed! ah what must thou have felt!650
20063,BOOK XXIV.,How hast thou dared to seek alone the fleet
20064,BOOK XXIV.,"Of the Achaians, and his face by whom"
20065,BOOK XXIV.,So many of thy valiant sons have fallen?
20066,BOOK XXIV.,"Thou hast a heart of iron, terror-proof."
20067,BOOK XXIV.,"Come—sit beside me—let us, if we may,665"
20068,BOOK XXIV.,"Great mourners both, bid sorrow sleep awhile."
20069,BOOK XXIV.,There is no profit of our sighs and tears;
20070,BOOK XXIV.,"For thus, exempt from care themselves, the Gods"
20071,BOOK XXIV.,Ordain man’s miserable race to mourn.
20072,BOOK XXIV.,Fast by the threshold of Jove’s courts are placed660
20073,BOOK XXIV.,"Two casks, one stored with evil, one with good,"
20074,BOOK XXIV.,From which the God dispenses as he wills.
20075,BOOK XXIV.,"For whom the glorious Thunderer mingles both,"
20076,BOOK XXIV.,He leads a life checker’d with good and ill
20077,BOOK XXIV.,Alternate; but to whom he gives unmixt665
20078,BOOK XXIV.,"The bitter cup, he makes that man a curse,"
20079,BOOK XXIV.,"His name becomes a by-word of reproach,"
20080,BOOK XXIV.,"His strength is hunger-bitten, and he walks"
20081,BOOK XXIV.,"The blessed earth, unblest, go where he may."
20082,BOOK XXIV.,So was my father Peleus at his birth670
20083,BOOK XXIV.,Nobly endow’d with plenty and with wealth
20084,BOOK XXIV.,"Distinguish’d by the Gods past all mankind,"
20085,BOOK XXIV.,"Lord of the Myrmidons, and, though a man,"
20086,BOOK XXIV.,Yet match’d from heaven with an immortal bride.
20087,BOOK XXIV.,"But even him the Gods afflict, a son675"
20088,BOOK XXIV.,"Refusing him, who might possess his throne"
20089,BOOK XXIV.,"Hereafter; for myself, his only heir,"
20090,BOOK XXIV.,"Pass as a dream, and while I live, instead"
20091,BOOK XXIV.,"Of solacing his age, here sit, before"
20092,BOOK XXIV.,"Your distant walls, the scourge of thee and thine.680"
20093,BOOK XXIV.,"Thee also, ancient Priam, we have heard"
20094,BOOK XXIV.,"Reported, once possessor of such wealth"
20095,BOOK XXIV.,"As neither Lesbos, seat of Macar, owns,"
20096,BOOK XXIV.,"Nor eastern Phrygia, nor yet all the ports"
20097,BOOK XXIV.,"Of Hellespont, but thou didst pass them all685"
20098,BOOK XXIV.,"In riches, and in number of thy sons."
20099,BOOK XXIV.,But since the Powers of heaven brought on thy land
20100,BOOK XXIV.,"This fatal war, battle and deeds of death"
20101,BOOK XXIV.,Always surround the city where thou reign’st.
20102,BOOK XXIV.,"Cease, therefore, from unprofitable tears,690"
20103,BOOK XXIV.,"Which, ere they raise thy son to life again"
20104,BOOK XXIV.,"Shall, doubtless, find fresh cause for which to flow."
20105,BOOK XXIV.,To whom the ancient King godlike replied.
20106,BOOK XXIV.,"Hero, forbear. No seat is here for me,"
20107,BOOK XXIV.,While Hector lies unburied in your camp.695
20108,BOOK XXIV.,"Loose him, and loose him now, that with these eyes"
20109,BOOK XXIV.,I may behold my son; accept a price
20110,BOOK XXIV.,"Magnificent, which may’st thou long enjoy,"
20111,BOOK XXIV.,"And, since my life was precious in thy sight,"
20112,BOOK XXIV.,May’st thou revisit safe thy native shore!700
20113,BOOK XXIV.,"To whom Achilles, lowering, and in wrath.[13]"
20114,BOOK XXIV.,"Urge me no longer, at a time like this,"
20115,BOOK XXIV.,With that harsh note; I am already inclin’d
20116,BOOK XXIV.,"To loose him. Thetis, my own mother came"
20117,BOOK XXIV.,"Herself on that same errand, sent from Jove.705"
20118,BOOK XXIV.,Priam! I understand thee well. I know
20119,BOOK XXIV.,"That, by some God conducted, thou hast reach’d"
20120,BOOK XXIV.,"Achaia’s fleet; for, without aid divine,"
20121,BOOK XXIV.,"No mortal even in his prime of youth,"
20122,BOOK XXIV.,Had dared the attempt; guards vigilant as ours710
20123,BOOK XXIV.,"He should not easily elude, such gates,"
20124,BOOK XXIV.,"So massy, should not easily unbar."
20125,BOOK XXIV.,"Thou, therefore, vex me not in my distress,"
20126,BOOK XXIV.,"Lest I abhor to see thee in my tent,"
20127,BOOK XXIV.,"And, borne beyond all limits, set at nought715"
20128,BOOK XXIV.,"Thee, and thy prayer, and the command of Jove."
20129,BOOK XXIV.,"He said; the old King trembled, and obey’d."
20130,BOOK XXIV.,"Then sprang Pelides like a lion forth,"
20131,BOOK XXIV.,"Not sole, but with his two attendant friends"
20132,BOOK XXIV.,"Alcimus and Automedon the brave,720"
20133,BOOK XXIV.,For them (Patroclus slain) he honor’d most
20134,BOOK XXIV.,Of all the Myrmidons. They from the yoke
20135,BOOK XXIV.,"Released both steeds and mules, then introduced"
20136,BOOK XXIV.,And placed the herald of the hoary King.
20137,BOOK XXIV.,They lighten’d next the litter of its charge725
20138,BOOK XXIV.,"Inestimable, leaving yet behind"
20139,BOOK XXIV.,"Two mantles and a vest, that, not unveil’d,"
20140,BOOK XXIV.,The body might be borne back into Troy.
20141,BOOK XXIV.,"Then, calling forth his women, them he bade"
20142,BOOK XXIV.,"Lave and anoint the body, but apart,730"
20143,BOOK XXIV.,"Lest haply Priam, noticing his son,"
20144,BOOK XXIV.,"Through stress of grief should give resentment scope,"
20145,BOOK XXIV.,And irritate by some affront himself
20146,BOOK XXIV.,"To slay him, in despite of Jove’s commands.[14]"
20147,BOOK XXIV.,"They, therefore, laving and anointing first735"
20148,BOOK XXIV.,"The body, cover’d it with cloak and vest;"
20149,BOOK XXIV.,"Then, Peleus’ son disposed it on the bier,"
20150,BOOK XXIV.,"Lifting it from the ground, and his two friends"
20151,BOOK XXIV.,Together heaved it to the royal wain.
20152,BOOK XXIV.,"Achilles, last, groaning, his friend invoked.740"
20153,BOOK XXIV.,
20154,BOOK XXIV.,"Patroclus! should the tidings reach thine ear,"
20155,BOOK XXIV.,"Although in Ades, that I have released"
20156,BOOK XXIV.,"The noble Hector at his father’s suit,"
20157,BOOK XXIV.,Resent it not; no sordid gifts have paid
20158,BOOK XXIV.,"His ransom-price, which thou shalt also share.745"
20159,BOOK XXIV.,"So saying, Achilles to his tent return’d,"
20160,BOOK XXIV.,And on the splendid couch whence he had risen
20161,BOOK XXIV.,"Again reclined, opposite to the seat"
20162,BOOK XXIV.,"Of Priam, whom the hero thus bespake."
20163,BOOK XXIV.,"Priam! at thy request thy son is loosed,750"
20164,BOOK XXIV.,And lying on his bier; at dawn of day
20165,BOOK XXIV.,Thou shalt both see him and convey him hence
20166,BOOK XXIV.,Thyself to Troy. But take we now repast;
20167,BOOK XXIV.,For even bright-hair’d Niobe her food
20168,BOOK XXIV.,"Forgat not, though of children twelve bereft,755"
20169,BOOK XXIV.,"Of daughters six, and of six blooming sons."
20170,BOOK XXIV.,"Apollo these struck from his silver bow,"
20171,BOOK XXIV.,"And those shaft-arm’d Diana, both incensed"
20172,BOOK XXIV.,That oft Latona’s children and her own
20173,BOOK XXIV.,"Numbering, she scorn’d the Goddess who had borne760"
20174,BOOK XXIV.,"Two only, while herself had twelve to boast."
20175,BOOK XXIV.,Vain boast! those two sufficed to slay them all.
20176,BOOK XXIV.,"Nine days they welter’d in their blood, no man"
20177,BOOK XXIV.,"Was found to bury them, for Jove had changed"
20178,BOOK XXIV.,"To stone the people; but themselves, at last,765"
20179,BOOK XXIV.,The Powers of heaven entomb’d them on the tenth.
20180,BOOK XXIV.,"Yet even she, once satisfied with tears,"
20181,BOOK XXIV.,Remember’d food; and now the rocks among
20182,BOOK XXIV.,"And pathless solitudes of Sipylus,"
20183,BOOK XXIV.,The rumor’d cradle of the nymphs who dance770
20184,BOOK XXIV.,"On Acheloüs’ banks, although to stone"
20185,BOOK XXIV.,"Transform’d, she broods her heaven-inflicted woes."
20186,BOOK XXIV.,"Come, then, my venerable guest! take we"
20187,BOOK XXIV.,Refreshment also; once arrived in Troy
20188,BOOK XXIV.,"With thy dear son, thou shalt have time to weep775"
20189,BOOK XXIV.,"Sufficient, nor without most weighty cause."
20190,BOOK XXIV.,"So spake Achilles, and, upstarting, slew"
20191,BOOK XXIV.,"A sheep white-fleeced, which his attendants flay’d,"
20192,BOOK XXIV.,And busily and with much skill their task
20193,BOOK XXIV.,"Administ’ring, first scored the viands well,780"
20194,BOOK XXIV.,"Then pierced them with the spits, and when the roast"
20195,BOOK XXIV.,"Was finish’d, drew them from the spits again."
20196,BOOK XXIV.,"And now, Automedon dispensed around"
20197,BOOK XXIV.,"The polish’d board bread in neat baskets piled,"
20198,BOOK XXIV.,"Which done, Achilles portion’d out to each785"
20199,BOOK XXIV.,"His share, and all assail’d the ready feast."
20200,BOOK XXIV.,"But when nor hunger more nor thirst they felt,"
20201,BOOK XXIV.,"Dardanian Priam, wond’ring at his bulk"
20202,BOOK XXIV.,And beauty (for he seem’d some God from heaven)
20203,BOOK XXIV.,"Gazed on Achilles, while Achilles held790"
20204,BOOK XXIV.,Not less in admiration of his looks
20205,BOOK XXIV.,"Benign, and of his gentle converse wise,"
20206,BOOK XXIV.,"Gazed on Dardanian Priam, and, at length"
20207,BOOK XXIV.,(The eyes of each gratified to the full)
20208,BOOK XXIV.,The ancient King thus to Achilles spake.795
20209,BOOK XXIV.,"Hero! dismiss us now each to our bed,"
20210,BOOK XXIV.,"That there at ease reclined, we may enjoy"
20211,BOOK XXIV.,Sweet sleep; for never have these eyelids closed
20212,BOOK XXIV.,"Since Hector fell and died, but without cease"
20213,BOOK XXIV.,"I mourn, and nourishing unnumber’d woes,800"
20214,BOOK XXIV.,Have roll’d me in the ashes of my courts.
20215,BOOK XXIV.,"But I have now both tasted food, and given"
20216,BOOK XXIV.,"Wine to my lips, untasted till with thee."
20217,BOOK XXIV.,"So he, and at his word Achilles bade"
20218,BOOK XXIV.,His train beneath his portico prepare805
20219,BOOK XXIV.,"With all dispatch two couches, purple rugs,"
20220,BOOK XXIV.,"And arras, and warm mantles over all."
20221,BOOK XXIV.,"Forth went the women bearing lights, and spread"
20222,BOOK XXIV.,"A couch for each, when feigning needful fear,[15]"
20223,BOOK XXIV.,Achilles thus his speech to Priam turn’d.810
20224,BOOK XXIV.,My aged guest beloved; sleep thou without;
20225,BOOK XXIV.,Lest some Achaian chief (for such are wont
20226,BOOK XXIV.,"Ofttimes, here sitting, to consult with me)"
20227,BOOK XXIV.,Hither repair; of whom should any chance
20228,BOOK XXIV.,"To spy thee through the gloom, he would at once815"
20229,BOOK XXIV.,"Convey the tale to Agamemnon’s ear,"
20230,BOOK XXIV.,"Whence hindrance might arise, and the release"
20231,BOOK XXIV.,Haply of Hector’s body be delay’d.
20232,BOOK XXIV.,But answer me with truth. How many days
20233,BOOK XXIV.,Wouldst thou assign to the funereal rites820
20234,BOOK XXIV.,"Of noble Hector, for so long I mean"
20235,BOOK XXIV.,"Myself to rest, and keep the host at home?"
20236,BOOK XXIV.,Then thus the ancient King godlike replied.
20237,BOOK XXIV.,If thou indeed be willing that we give
20238,BOOK XXIV.,"Burial to noble Hector, by an act825"
20239,BOOK XXIV.,"So generous, O Achilles! me thou shalt"
20240,BOOK XXIV.,"Much gratify; for we are shut, thou know’st,"
20241,BOOK XXIV.,"In Ilium close, and fuel must procure"
20242,BOOK XXIV.,"From Ida’s side remote; fear, too, hath seized"
20243,BOOK XXIV.,On all our people. Therefore thus I say.830
20244,BOOK XXIV.,Nine days we wish to mourn him in the house;
20245,BOOK XXIV.,"To his interment we would give the tenth,"
20246,BOOK XXIV.,And to the public banquet; the eleventh
20247,BOOK XXIV.,Shall see us build his tomb; and on the twelfth
20248,BOOK XXIV.,(If war we must) we will to war again.835
20249,BOOK XXIV.,"To whom Achilles, matchless in the race."
20250,BOOK XXIV.,"So be it, ancient Priam! I will curb"
20251,BOOK XXIV.,"Twelve days the rage of war, at thy desire.[16]"
20252,BOOK XXIV.,"He spake, and at his wrist the right hand grasp’d"
20253,BOOK XXIV.,"Of the old sovereign, to dispel his fear.840"
20254,BOOK XXIV.,Then in the vestibule the herald slept
20255,BOOK XXIV.,"And Priam, prudent both, but Peleus’ son"
20256,BOOK XXIV.,"In the interior tent, and at his side"
20257,BOOK XXIV.,"Brisëis, with transcendent beauty adorn’d."
20258,BOOK XXIV.,
20259,BOOK XXIV.,"Now all, all night, by gentle sleep subdued,845"
20260,BOOK XXIV.,"Both Gods and chariot-ruling warriors lay,"
20261,BOOK XXIV.,"But not the benefactor of mankind,"
20262,BOOK XXIV.,"Hermes; him sleep seized not, but deep he mused"
20263,BOOK XXIV.,How likeliest from amid the Grecian fleet
20264,BOOK XXIV.,He might deliver by the guard unseen850
20265,BOOK XXIV.,The King of Ilium; at his head he stood
20266,BOOK XXIV.,"In vision, and the senior thus bespake."
20267,BOOK XXIV.,Ah heedless and secure! hast thou no dread
20268,BOOK XXIV.,"Of mischief, ancient King, that thus by foes"
20269,BOOK XXIV.,"Thou sleep’st surrounded, lull’d by the consent855"
20270,BOOK XXIV.,And sufferance of Achilles? Thou hast given
20271,BOOK XXIV.,"Much for redemption of thy darling son,"
20272,BOOK XXIV.,But thrice that sum thy sons who still survive
20273,BOOK XXIV.,Must give to Agamemnon and the Greeks
20274,BOOK XXIV.,"For _thy_ redemption, should they know thee here.860"
20275,BOOK XXIV.,He ended; at the sound alarm’d upsprang
20276,BOOK XXIV.,"The King, and roused his herald. Hermes yoked"
20277,BOOK XXIV.,"Himself both mules and steeds, and through the camp"
20278,BOOK XXIV.,"Drove them incontinent, by all unseen."
20279,BOOK XXIV.,"Soon as the windings of the stream they reach’d,865"
20280,BOOK XXIV.,"Deep-eddied Xanthus, progeny of Jove,"
20281,BOOK XXIV.,"Mercury the Olympian summit sought,"
20282,BOOK XXIV.,And saffron-vested morn o’erspread the earth.
20283,BOOK XXIV.,"They, loud lamenting, to the city drove"
20284,BOOK XXIV.,Their steeds; the mules close follow’d with the dead.870
20285,BOOK XXIV.,"Nor warrior yet, nor cinctured matron knew"
20286,BOOK XXIV.,"Of all in Ilium aught of their approach,"
20287,BOOK XXIV.,"Cassandra sole except. She, beautiful"
20288,BOOK XXIV.,"As golden Venus, mounted on the height"
20289,BOOK XXIV.,"Of Pergamus, her father first discern’d,875"
20290,BOOK XXIV.,"Borne on his chariot-seat erect, and knew:"
20291,BOOK XXIV.,The herald heard so oft in echoing Troy;
20292,BOOK XXIV.,"Him also on his bier outstretch’d she mark’d,"
20293,BOOK XXIV.,"Whom the mules drew. Then, shrieking, through the streets"
20294,BOOK XXIV.,"She ran of Troy, and loud proclaim’d the sight.880"
20295,BOOK XXIV.,"Ye sons of Ilium and ye daughters, haste,"
20296,BOOK XXIV.,"Haste all to look on Hector, if ye e’er"
20297,BOOK XXIV.,"With joy beheld him, while he yet survived,"
20298,BOOK XXIV.,From fight returning; for all Ilium erst
20299,BOOK XXIV.,"In him, and all her citizens rejoiced.885"
20300,BOOK XXIV.,She spake. Then neither male nor female more
20301,BOOK XXIV.,"In Troy remain’d, such sorrow seized on all."
20302,BOOK XXIV.,"Issuing from the city-gate, they met"
20303,BOOK XXIV.,"Priam conducting, sad, the body home,"
20304,BOOK XXIV.,"And, foremost of them all, the mother flew890"
20305,BOOK XXIV.,"And wife of Hector to the bier, on which"
20306,BOOK XXIV.,Their torn-off tresses with unsparing hands
20307,BOOK XXIV.,"They shower’d, while all the people wept around."
20308,BOOK XXIV.,"All day, and to the going down of day"
20309,BOOK XXIV.,"They thus had mourn’d the dead before the gates,895"
20310,BOOK XXIV.,Had not their Sovereign from his chariot-seat
20311,BOOK XXIV.,Thus spoken to the multitude around.
20312,BOOK XXIV.,"Fall back on either side, and let the mules"
20313,BOOK XXIV.,Pass on; the body in my palace once
20314,BOOK XXIV.,"Deposited, ye then may weep your fill.900"
20315,BOOK XXIV.,"He said; they, opening, gave the litter way."
20316,BOOK XXIV.,"Arrived within the royal house, they stretch’d"
20317,BOOK XXIV.,"The breathless Hector on a sumptuous bed,"
20318,BOOK XXIV.,"And singers placed beside him, who should chant"
20319,BOOK XXIV.,The strain funereal; they with many a groan905
20320,BOOK XXIV.,"The dirge began, and still, at every close,"
20321,BOOK XXIV.,The female train with many a groan replied.
20322,BOOK XXIV.,"Then, in the midst, Andromache white-arm’d"
20323,BOOK XXIV.,Between her palms the dreadful Hector’s head
20324,BOOK XXIV.,"Pressing, her lamentation thus began.910"
20325,BOOK XXIV.,"[17]My hero! thou hast fallen in prime of life,"
20326,BOOK XXIV.,"Me leaving here desolate, and the fruit"
20327,BOOK XXIV.,"Of our ill-fated loves, a helpless child,"
20328,BOOK XXIV.,Whom grown to manhood I despair to see.
20329,BOOK XXIV.,"For ere that day arrive, down from her height915"
20330,BOOK XXIV.,"Precipitated shall this city fall,"
20331,BOOK XXIV.,"Since thou hast perish’d once her sure defence,"
20332,BOOK XXIV.,"Faithful protector of her spotless wives,"
20333,BOOK XXIV.,And all their little ones. Those wives shall soon
20334,BOOK XXIV.,"In Grecian barks capacious hence be borne,920"
20335,BOOK XXIV.,"And I among the rest. But thee, my child!"
20336,BOOK XXIV.,Either thy fate shall with thy mother send
20337,BOOK XXIV.,Captive into a land where thou shalt serve
20338,BOOK XXIV.,"In sordid drudgery some cruel lord,"
20339,BOOK XXIV.,"Or haply some Achaian here, thy hand925"
20340,BOOK XXIV.,"Seizing, shall hurl thee from a turret-top"
20341,BOOK XXIV.,"To a sad death, avenging brother, son,"
20342,BOOK XXIV.,Or father by the hands of Hector slain;
20343,BOOK XXIV.,For he made many a Grecian bite the ground.
20344,BOOK XXIV.,"Thy father, boy, bore never into fight930"
20345,BOOK XXIV.,"A milky mind, and for that self-same cause"
20346,BOOK XXIV.,Is now bewail’d in every house of Troy.
20347,BOOK XXIV.,Sorrow unutterable thou hast caused
20348,BOOK XXIV.,"Thy parents, Hector! but to me hast left"
20349,BOOK XXIV.,"Largest bequest of misery, to whom,935"
20350,BOOK XXIV.,"Dying, thou neither didst thy arms extend"
20351,BOOK XXIV.,"Forth from thy bed, nor gavest me precious word"
20352,BOOK XXIV.,To be remember’d day and night with tears.
20353,BOOK XXIV.,"So spake she weeping, whom her maidens all"
20354,BOOK XXIV.,"With sighs accompanied, and her complaint940"
20355,BOOK XXIV.,Mingled with sobs Hecuba next began.
20356,BOOK XXIV.,Ah Hector! dearest to thy mother’s heart
20357,BOOK XXIV.,"Of all her sons, much must the Gods have loved"
20358,BOOK XXIV.,"Thee living, whom, though dead, they thus preserve."
20359,BOOK XXIV.,What son soever of our house beside945
20360,BOOK XXIV.,"Achilles took, over the barren deep"
20361,BOOK XXIV.,"To Samos, Imbrus, or to Lemnos girt"
20362,BOOK XXIV.,"With rocks inhospitable, him he sold;"
20363,BOOK XXIV.,"But thee, by his dread spear of life deprived,"
20364,BOOK XXIV.,"He dragg’d and dragg’d around Patroclus’ tomb,950"
20365,BOOK XXIV.,As if to raise again his friend to life
20366,BOOK XXIV.,Whom thou hadst vanquish’d; yet he raised him not.
20367,BOOK XXIV.,"But as for thee, thou liest here with dew"
20368,BOOK XXIV.,"Besprinkled, fresh as a young plant,[18] and more"
20369,BOOK XXIV.,Resemblest some fair youth by gentle shafts955
20370,BOOK XXIV.,"Of Phœbus pierced, than one in battle slain."
20371,BOOK XXIV.,"So spake the Queen, exciting in all hearts"
20372,BOOK XXIV.,"Sorrow immeasurable, after whom"
20373,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus Helen, third, her lamentation pour’d."
20374,BOOK XXIV.,[19]Ah dearer far than all my brothers else960
20375,BOOK XXIV.,"Of Priam’s house! for being Paris’ spouse,"
20376,BOOK XXIV.,"Who brought me (would I had first died!) to Troy,"
20377,BOOK XXIV.,I call thy brothers mine; since forth I came
20378,BOOK XXIV.,"From Sparta, it is now the twentieth year,"
20379,BOOK XXIV.,"Yet never heard I once hard speech from thee,965"
20380,BOOK XXIV.,"Or taunt morose, but if it ever chanced,"
20381,BOOK XXIV.,That of thy father’s house female or male
20382,BOOK XXIV.,"Blamed me, and even if herself the Queen"
20383,BOOK XXIV.,"(For in the King, whate’er befell, I found"
20384,BOOK XXIV.,Always a father) thou hast interposed970
20385,BOOK XXIV.,Thy gentle temper and thy gentle speech
20386,BOOK XXIV.,"To soothe them; therefore, with the same sad drops"
20387,BOOK XXIV.,"Thy fate, oh Hector! and my own I weep;"
20388,BOOK XXIV.,For other friend within the ample bounds
20389,BOOK XXIV.,"Of Ilium have I none, nor hope to hear975"
20390,BOOK XXIV.,"Kind word again, with horror view’d by all."
20391,BOOK XXIV.,"So Helen spake weeping, to whom with groans"
20392,BOOK XXIV.,"The countless multitude replied, and thus"
20393,BOOK XXIV.,Their ancient sovereign next his people charged.
20394,BOOK XXIV.,"Ye Trojans, now bring fuel home, nor fear980"
20395,BOOK XXIV.,Close ambush of the Greeks; Achilles’ self
20396,BOOK XXIV.,"Gave me, at my dismission from his fleet,"
20397,BOOK XXIV.,"Assurance, that from hostile force secure"
20398,BOOK XXIV.,"We shall remain, till the twelfth dawn arise."
20399,BOOK XXIV.,"All, then, their mules and oxen to the wains985"
20400,BOOK XXIV.,"Join’d speedily, and under Ilium’s walls"
20401,BOOK XXIV.,"Assembled numerous; nine whole days they toil’d,"
20402,BOOK XXIV.,"Bringing much fuel home, and when the tenth"
20403,BOOK XXIV.,"Bright morn, with light for human kind, arose,"
20404,BOOK XXIV.,"Then bearing noble Hector forth, with tears990"
20405,BOOK XXIV.,"Shed copious, on the summit of the pile"
20406,BOOK XXIV.,"They placed him, and the fuel fired beneath."
20407,BOOK XXIV.,"But when Aurora, daughter of the Dawn,"
20408,BOOK XXIV.,"Redden’d the east, then, thronging forth, all Troy"
20409,BOOK XXIV.,Encompass’d noble Hector’s pile around.995
20410,BOOK XXIV.,"The whole vast multitude convened, with wine"
20411,BOOK XXIV.,"They quench’d the pile throughout, leaving no part"
